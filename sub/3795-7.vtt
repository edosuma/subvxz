I'm up for anything, Billy.

01:31.386 --> 01:33.254
So if you've got
a good idea, bring it.

01:33.288 --> 01:35.089
I look forward
to the challenge.

01:35.123 --> 01:37.124
- Are you a director?
- Are you kidding?

01:37.159 --> 01:40.828
This is Billy Walsh.
Once upon a time
he was the best.

01:40.862 --> 01:44.465
- Really?
- Well, it's still in there
but priorities shift.

01:44.499 --> 01:46.901
Oh yeah? What are
your priorities now?

01:46.935 --> 01:50.071
- I'm married.
- And you're with me
tonight, sweetheart.

01:50.105 --> 01:51.305
Have a good evening, all right?

01:51.339 --> 01:52.807
Think of something good
for me, Billy.

01:52.841 --> 01:55.109
It's marinating, all right?
It's marinating.

01:55.143 --> 01:57.011
What the hell was that?

01:57.045 --> 01:59.814
You had your tongue in
my mouth five minutes ago.

02:01.149 --> 02:03.017
You should have seen this kid.

02:03.051 --> 02:06.220
He tried to play it off
but the kid was indeed
terrified.

02:06.288 --> 02:08.354
- Right or wrong?
- Poor baby.

02:08.389 --> 02:10.291
I'd never jumped out
of a plane before.

02:10.324 --> 02:11.926
- Did you like it?
- It was amazing.

02:11.960 --> 02:14.962
To be honest, when I
got in the air, I felt
complete peace.

02:14.996 --> 02:17.064
- Let's do it again tomorrow.
- Absolutely.

02:17.099 --> 02:19.266
- You're on!
- Ah, hear hear.

02:19.301 --> 02:21.368
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

You guys have anything
besides Tequila?

02:36.585 --> 02:39.653
Uh, no.
But it's the world's best
so enjoy it, Chris.

02:39.688 --> 02:42.423
Ugh, what is this,
like a sponsored party?

02:42.457 --> 02:45.826
No, it's some
good free Tequila,
so drink up.

02:45.861 --> 02:47.595
My girl likes vodka, turtle.

02:47.629 --> 02:50.431
Trust me, anvion Margarita
will change your life.

02:50.465 --> 02:52.967
Like playing for
the Knicks would have.
Enjoy.

02:53.001 --> 02:56.437
I'll give you 1000 bucks
to get me some vodka.

02:56.471 --> 02:59.306
<i>- Yo, e, what up?
- I just want to make sure
Vince is ready</i>

02:59.341 --> 03:02.209
- For his meeting tomorrow.
- What's he got to do
to get ready?

03:02.244 --> 03:04.311
<i>He's got to rest.</i>

03:06.348 --> 03:09.116
<i>- He's resting.
- Look, it's very important</i>

03:09.151 --> 03:11.585
That Vince make
a better impression than he
did at the last meeting.

03:11.620 --> 03:13.954
<i>- Understood.
- Who's there?</i>

03:13.989 --> 03:16.257
Uh, just a few people.

03:16.291 --> 03:19.593
- What people?
- We were at goal and Vince
announced an after-party.

03:19.628 --> 03:21.562
Awesome.
Do me a favor.

03:21.596 --> 03:23.631
- Make sure the kid's
in bed early.
- I'm on it, ma.

03:23.665 --> 03:25.032
<i>- Thanks.
- Later.</i>

03:25.066 --> 03:28.235
- What's wrong?
- They're having a party.

03:28.270 --> 03:30.805
- You jealous?
- Jealous of what?

03:30.839 --> 03:32.573
Girls, I don't know.

03:32.607 --> 03:34.542
No, are you kidding?
I'm as happy as I can be.

03:34.576 --> 03:36.343
I just want to get
Vince's focus back.

03:36.378 --> 03:39.346
Just give me your focus.

03:44.319 --> 03:46.453
Done.

03:46.488 --> 03:48.189
- Good morning, Ari.
- Is it?

03:48.223 --> 03:51.125
<i>- what are you laughing at?</i>

03:51.159 --> 03:52.960
- Nothing.
- Then don't.

03:52.994 --> 03:55.029
- Anything?
- I've been refreshing

03:55.063 --> 03:57.498
"deadline Hollywood" every
15 seconds like you asked.

03:57.532 --> 03:59.834
- Nothing about you on there.
- How is that possible?

03:59.868 --> 04:02.069
Maybe you're
not important enough
to warrant a story.

04:02.103 --> 04:04.171
"deadline Hollywood"
would run a story about me

04:04.206 --> 04:06.941
Having a loose stool
much less having
recorded tapes of me.

04:06.975 --> 04:10.444
Well, you're gonna need
to relax or everyone here
is gonna panic as well.

04:10.478 --> 04:12.913
I am not panicked.
I just want to know
what's going on.

04:12.948 --> 04:14.315
Get Anna Fowler on the phone.

04:14.349 --> 04:16.817
Do not go
into the lion's den
without an invite, Ari.

04:16.851 --> 04:20.019
- I'll be fine.
I'll give her a scoop.
- Oh, you got one?

04:20.055 --> 04:22.890
Yeah, I'm gonna tell her
you blew Mickey Rooney
and gargled with it.

04:22.924 --> 04:25.559
- She'll love it.
- I've got Anna.

04:27.729 --> 04:29.663
How are you, Anna?

04:29.698 --> 04:31.699
Hey, Ari.
You calling to gloat?

04:31.733 --> 04:35.502
- Gloat about what?
- Lizzie grant leaving Amanda's.

04:35.537 --> 04:37.771
Leaving?
She's been there one day.

04:37.806 --> 04:39.874
Wait, you don't know
about this?

04:39.908 --> 04:42.243
<i>- Uh...
- Then why are you
calling me?</i>

04:42.277 --> 04:44.511
I like you.

04:44.546 --> 04:46.413
I did hear that you and Lizzie

04:46.448 --> 04:49.083
Had some angry words
when she left you.

04:49.117 --> 04:50.684
That is not true.

04:50.719 --> 04:52.386
When she left I was devastated.

04:52.420 --> 04:55.122
<i>Lizzie has been like
a daughter to me.</i>

04:55.156 --> 04:57.791
But sometimes a good father
has to let his daughter go free

04:57.826 --> 04:59.860
So her wings
can finally sprout.

04:59.895 --> 05:02.429
<i>Why the fuck are you
calling me then, Ari?</i>

05:02.464 --> 05:04.531
Do I really need
to start digging here?

05:04.566 --> 05:07.868
- No.
- Then you'd better
give me something.

05:07.903 --> 05:10.371
Howard stern...

05:10.405 --> 05:12.539
Is gonna be the new host
of "jeopardy."

05:12.574 --> 05:15.042
- Oh, come on.
- You didn't hear it from me.

05:15.076 --> 05:17.344
- The n.F.L. Peeps are calling.
- I'll call 'em from the road.

05:17.379 --> 05:19.446
Is Howard stern really
gonna host "jeopardy"?

05:19.481 --> 05:21.582
- Where are you going?
- I'm gonna go see Lizzie.

05:21.616 --> 05:23.384
I think I found
a chink in her armor.

05:23.418 --> 05:25.286
I don't think you should
talk to her, Ari.

05:25.320 --> 05:28.822
I think that you know
what I think about
your thoughts, Babs.

05:30.825 --> 05:33.527

05:33.595 --> 05:35.930

05:35.964 --> 05:38.766
Love the delivery
truck, turtle.

05:38.800 --> 05:41.068
- It gets the job done.
- How come you still got Alex?

05:41.102 --> 05:43.671
- I thought you got rid
of the car service.
- I let him keep me.

05:43.705 --> 05:45.072
- Really?
- Yup.

05:45.106 --> 05:46.874
Thanks for bringing
this over, man.

05:46.908 --> 05:49.643
Anything I can do to help
spread the word that is avion.

05:49.678 --> 05:52.513
- How many calls have you
gotten today?
- 40 already.

05:52.547 --> 05:54.682
That's sick.
That's just from
Vince tweeting.

05:54.716 --> 05:56.250
Wait till we stick
his face on billboards.

05:56.284 --> 05:59.053
Listen, who else are you
giving this to in the area?

05:59.087 --> 06:00.921
That stuff's like oil, kid.
Everybody wants it.

06:00.956 --> 06:03.490
But I'm ground zero
for breaking product in
Hollywood, you know that.

06:03.525 --> 06:05.359
You're the first place
in the States to have it.

06:05.393 --> 06:07.594
And if you put it in front
the patron so no one
can see that,

06:07.629 --> 06:10.264
I won't give anyone else
within three miles
stuff for a month.

06:10.298 --> 06:12.700
I think I can
make that happen.
How much more can you get me?

06:12.734 --> 06:15.369
- How much do you want?
- I'll take 25 cases to start.

06:15.403 --> 06:17.004
How about I get Vince to tweet

06:17.038 --> 06:19.473
That you're the only
place in town that has it,
you take 50?

06:19.507 --> 06:22.710
<i>- Done.
See? That's why
I let him keep me.</i>

06:22.744 --> 06:25.446
- His brain turns me on.
- I thought it was my body.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.615
- Huh-uh.
- No? No?

06:38.059 --> 06:39.927
- Yeah?
- You up?

06:39.961 --> 06:42.863
<i>- Yeah, of course.
- You know you've got that
meeting in 45 minutes.</i>

06:42.897 --> 06:45.699
- Yeah, I know.
- You want me to go with you?

06:45.734 --> 06:48.035
No, e, relax.
I'm all good.

06:48.069 --> 06:50.804
<i>- All right, good.
I'll talk to you later.
- Bye.</i>

06:50.839 --> 06:52.940
You have to go?

06:52.974 --> 06:55.275
Yeah, I've got to go
win over my director.

06:55.310 --> 06:56.944
You have a couple minutes.

06:56.978 --> 07:00.114
I'm exhausted.
I'm not sure we'd accomplish
much in a couple minutes.

07:00.148 --> 07:02.683
You relax, I'll accomplish.

07:09.224 --> 07:11.025
<i>- I'm up, I'm up!</i>

07:11.059 --> 07:12.726
Just checking.

07:23.972 --> 07:25.439
What are you doing, Billy?

07:25.473 --> 07:27.508
<i>- Working.
- Uh-huh.</i>

07:27.542 --> 07:30.377
<i>- I do my best work
while meditating.
- That's cool.</i>

07:30.412 --> 07:32.913
I think I got
a killer idea for drama.

07:32.947 --> 07:34.948
What is it?

07:34.983 --> 07:37.351
Vince, I've got one
great pitch in me

07:37.385 --> 07:39.653
And I'm giving it
to e and drama in an hour.

07:39.687 --> 07:41.789
Going through
the proper channels,
I like that.

07:41.823 --> 07:43.824
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

07:43.858 --> 07:46.060
- What do you got?
- Meeting.

07:46.094 --> 07:47.928
Oh right, superhero stuff.

07:47.962 --> 07:50.097
- You ready?
- Yeah, why wouldn't I be?

07:50.131 --> 07:52.466
- You don't look ready.
- Why not?

07:52.500 --> 07:54.668
- You look tired.
- I do?

07:54.702 --> 07:56.703
Yeah, and you smell.

07:56.738 --> 07:59.039
Or maybe I smell.
I sweat when I meditate.

07:59.074 --> 08:02.443
Vince, you okay?

08:02.477 --> 08:04.144
Yeah.

08:04.179 --> 08:07.347
Took a Vicodin last night.
It knocked me out good.

08:07.382 --> 08:09.550
Guess I'm still not awake.

08:09.584 --> 08:11.685
Okay.

08:17.058 --> 08:19.626
I'm gonna wash my face,

08:19.661 --> 08:21.962
Grab a cup of coffee.

08:21.996 --> 08:23.831
Yeah, maybe grab a few, huh?

08:27.135 --> 08:29.970
- Lizzie.
- Are you kidding?

08:30.004 --> 08:32.606
This time I confess
I am following you.

08:32.640 --> 08:34.575
- Why?
- I feel bad.

08:34.609 --> 08:37.611
I heard that things aren't
working out too well for you
over at Amanda's.

08:37.645 --> 08:40.813
- Where'd you hear that?
- I have ears everywhere.

08:40.849 --> 08:43.350
- It has nothing to do with you.
- I haven't slept in two days.

08:43.384 --> 08:46.086
That has everything
to do with you.

08:46.121 --> 08:47.454
I can't help you sleep, Ari.

08:47.489 --> 08:50.257
I need those tapes back.

08:50.291 --> 08:51.925
"deadline Hollywood" has them.

08:51.960 --> 08:53.293
No they don't.

08:55.196 --> 08:57.297
Ari, why didn't you promote me?

08:57.332 --> 09:00.000
- Honestly.
- Honestly?

09:00.034 --> 09:03.770
My wife wanted me
to get rid of you.

09:05.573 --> 09:08.709
Wow, okay.
That's a lot more honest
than I expected.

09:08.743 --> 09:12.045
Not to mention I wouldn't
peg you as the type to bend
to your wife's demands.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.480
Well, you would be surprised.

09:13.515 --> 09:17.050
She wanted you gone long before
you asked for that promotion.

09:17.085 --> 09:19.953
- Then you quit and I didn't
have to do anything.
- What if I hadn't?

09:19.988 --> 09:22.623
I still wouldn't have
promoted you 'cause you
weren't ready.

09:22.657 --> 09:25.125
Someday you will be,
but not yet.

09:25.160 --> 09:28.629
- Honestly.
- I still disagree.

09:28.663 --> 09:31.465
Do you also disagree

09:31.499 --> 09:35.402
That had I given it
to you, other people,
not just my wife,

09:35.436 --> 09:37.104
Would have made
excuses as to why

09:37.138 --> 09:39.640
And you wouldn't be
recognized for your work?

09:39.674 --> 09:42.042
That is such a bullshit
double standard.

09:42.076 --> 09:44.912
I don't make the rules.
Not all of 'em anyway.

09:44.946 --> 09:48.282
You know, I actually
respect that you're still
standing your ground.

09:48.316 --> 09:51.318
Well, let's call
a truce. Move on.

09:51.352 --> 09:53.887
Yeah, I would if I had
somewhere to move on to.

09:53.922 --> 09:55.355
Well, come back to me.

09:55.390 --> 09:57.524
Yeah, with my tail
between my legs.

09:57.559 --> 09:59.426
Then for sure no one
would respect me.

09:59.460 --> 10:02.262
You can find a job.
Something better.

10:02.297 --> 10:05.599
- Maybe you can
help me find that.
- How?

10:05.633 --> 10:07.935
Ari, come on,
you control this town.

10:07.969 --> 10:09.703
If you believe in me, help me.

10:09.737 --> 10:11.738
Being an Agent was
just a means to an end.

10:11.773 --> 10:13.373
I would love a studio job.

10:13.408 --> 10:16.043
- I'll make some calls.
- Do more than that.

10:16.077 --> 10:17.477
I need those tapes, Lizzie.

10:17.512 --> 10:20.047
I don't know what's on them.
All right, I talk a lot.

10:20.081 --> 10:22.816
I'm mean with words.
My actions usually aren't.

10:22.850 --> 10:24.818
If they're as bad
as I've played them
in my head...

10:24.852 --> 10:28.088
- They're worse.
- ...That could be a real
problem for my family.

10:28.122 --> 10:30.791
- And for the n.F.L.
- The n.F.L. Will be done,
of course.

10:30.825 --> 10:33.193
And you know how much
I want that.

10:33.228 --> 10:35.729
But that will be
nothing compared

10:35.763 --> 10:40.000
To what I think might happen
with my wife and kids.

10:40.034 --> 10:42.202
Show some compassion.

10:42.237 --> 10:45.572
I already have, Ari.

10:45.607 --> 10:47.741
This whole thing
was Amanda's idea...

10:47.775 --> 10:51.411
To Sue, now this.

10:51.446 --> 10:54.081
That's why I'm not gonna
be working with her anymore.

10:54.115 --> 10:56.250
I appreciate that.

10:56.284 --> 10:58.719
I would appreciate a job.

10:58.753 --> 11:01.989
If you were gonna send
the tapes you would have
sent them already.

11:02.023 --> 11:05.359
Who knows, maybe five years
from now I might be going
through a nasty divorce

11:05.393 --> 11:07.728
And I might displace my anger
at all men towards you.

11:07.762 --> 11:10.897
- I will find you a job.
- I'll get you those tapes.

11:10.932 --> 11:12.733
We could have been
good together.

11:12.767 --> 11:15.202
We were good together.

11:22.143 --> 11:24.378
I think the bottle
needs to be updated.

11:24.412 --> 11:26.780
- The bottle?
- The label feels dated to me.

11:26.814 --> 11:30.484
I'm about to give you
mid-morning sex and you're
thinking about labels?

11:30.518 --> 11:32.586
My mind can't stop.
I've got a million ideas

11:32.620 --> 11:34.288
On how I can make
this company really pop.

11:34.322 --> 11:35.956
You know what 50 cent told me?

11:35.990 --> 11:39.226
He made 50 mil
in music and 150 mil
in vitamin water.

11:39.260 --> 11:40.594
Maybe we can make that.

11:40.628 --> 11:42.796
I'd just like to be able
to pay my rent.

11:42.830 --> 11:44.564
You got to dream big.

11:46.734 --> 11:48.535
- It's Carlos.
- May I?

11:48.569 --> 11:50.037
Yeah.

11:50.071 --> 11:51.838
Hey hey, Carlos.

11:51.873 --> 11:54.741
<i>- What do you think
about updating the bottle?
- What do you mean?</i>

11:54.776 --> 11:56.310
It feels a little dated to me.

11:56.344 --> 11:57.978
Turtle, slow down.

11:58.012 --> 12:00.247
The bottle is a cool shape,
I'll admit that.

12:00.281 --> 12:02.482
But I've promoted clubs
and I've bartended

12:02.517 --> 12:04.518
And the simple fact is
you need a bottle

12:04.552 --> 12:06.386
That's easy to grip
and ours isn't that easy.

12:06.421 --> 12:08.255
We'll talk about it when
I come up later this week.

12:08.289 --> 12:10.590
<i>- Why are you coming up?
- So we can talk.</i>

12:10.625 --> 12:12.192
About what?

12:12.226 --> 12:13.960
Well, first off
I can't get you 50 cases

12:13.995 --> 12:16.763
For this Gil Turner's.
Not by tonight.

12:16.798 --> 12:19.066
- Why not?
- 'cause I don't have
that many in L.A.

12:19.100 --> 12:20.867
You said whenever I need supply

12:20.902 --> 12:22.969
To call and you could
have 'em to me in an hour.

12:23.004 --> 12:24.971
<i>I meant for friends
or for a party,</i>

12:25.006 --> 12:26.907
Not so you could sell.
That's not your job.

12:26.941 --> 12:29.276
<i>I gave you stock
in this company to get Vince</i>

12:29.310 --> 12:31.244
To do an ad campaign,
not so you could be my salesman.

12:31.279 --> 12:33.413
Jesus, I already put onvincs

12:33.448 --> 12:35.315
Will be there tonight.
You're gonna make me look bad.

12:35.350 --> 12:36.817
Stop doing things on your own.

12:36.851 --> 12:39.086
You're going to make
yourself look bad.

12:39.120 --> 12:41.421
- Carlos...
- turtle, I'll be there
on Friday.

12:41.456 --> 12:42.723
We'll talk.

12:42.757 --> 12:45.826
He says he can't get me
the cases we need.

12:45.860 --> 12:48.495
So call Gil's and tell him.
He'll understand.

12:48.529 --> 12:51.098
He'll understand
that I don't deliver
when I promised to

12:51.132 --> 12:53.166
And more importantly
when Vince promises to.

12:53.201 --> 12:54.701
How many cases
do we have left here?

12:54.736 --> 12:56.570
- Eight maybe.
- Eight.

12:56.604 --> 12:58.472
- I can find the rest.
- How?

12:58.506 --> 13:00.307
I've just got
to make some calls.

13:03.144 --> 13:05.345
So how are y, Vince?

13:05.380 --> 13:09.049
I'm good, I'm good.
I just want to say I'm sorry
about our last meeting.

13:09.083 --> 13:11.885
Bringing a date obviously
wasn't the most professional
thing to do.

13:11.919 --> 13:13.553
I'm sorry.

13:13.588 --> 13:16.757
I was more concerned
with the fact that
I thought you were drunk.

13:16.791 --> 13:18.759
I wasn't.

13:18.793 --> 13:20.827
One glass of Tequila.

13:20.862 --> 13:22.863
And you're tweeting
about Tequila now.

13:22.897 --> 13:24.664
You really like the stuff, huh?

13:24.699 --> 13:26.433
It's a company
my friend got me into.

13:26.467 --> 13:29.269
But don't worry,
no more tweets about it.

13:29.303 --> 13:31.805
My fingers are sealed.

13:31.839 --> 13:35.208
You know, my lips are sealed
but you tweet with your fingers.

13:35.243 --> 13:37.177
Oh, that's funny.

13:37.211 --> 13:39.813
So, Vince,
here's why I wanted
to have this meeting.

13:39.847 --> 13:43.250
Obviously, as you know,
your commitment to do
"air-walker"

13:43.284 --> 13:46.153
Is what gave the studio
the confidence to greenlight
the movie.

13:46.187 --> 13:48.555
- And your directing.
- Well, thank you.

13:48.589 --> 13:50.824
Hopefully that had
a little something
to do with it.

13:50.858 --> 13:52.359
But here's the deal.

13:52.393 --> 13:55.562
If we're gonna go spend
more than a year of our
lives together,

13:55.596 --> 13:57.964
I need to know
that I can count on you.

13:57.999 --> 14:00.467
<i>- You can.
- I need to know</i>

14:00.501 --> 14:03.069
That everything about you
and your personal life

14:03.104 --> 14:06.740
- Is in control and in order.
- It is.

14:08.509 --> 14:10.911
It is.

14:10.945 --> 14:13.947
Because I've known you for
so long I feel superconfident

14:13.981 --> 14:16.383
That I can tailor a character
around your voice.

14:16.417 --> 14:18.285
And I have
the perfect character.

14:18.319 --> 14:20.554
I'm ready, Billy.
Show me what you got.

14:23.324 --> 14:26.660
- What the hell is that?
- I mentioned something
about this to you earlier

14:26.694 --> 14:29.930
- And I think you thought
I was joking, but I wasn't.
- What is it?

14:29.964 --> 14:32.365
- It's you, Johnny.
- I don't follow.

14:32.400 --> 14:33.967
<i>- Did you draw that?
- Yeah.</i>

14:34.001 --> 14:35.402
- It's pretty good.
- Thanks.

14:35.436 --> 14:38.004
- What does that
have to do with me?
- It is you, drama.

14:38.039 --> 14:40.240
You're a high-strung simian
trying to make it

14:40.274 --> 14:42.309
In a human world that
just doesn't get you.

14:42.343 --> 14:44.144
<i>- Is this some kind of joke?
- No, it's not a joke.</i>

14:44.178 --> 14:46.179
- Here, say something.
- Say something?

14:46.214 --> 14:47.848
<i>Yeah, hold this up here
and say something.</i>

14:47.882 --> 14:50.851
- Get that out of my face, bro.
- See? His voice is perfect.

14:50.885 --> 14:52.719
You want me to voice
a mean gorilla?

14:52.753 --> 14:54.921
No, he's not mean.
He's misunderstood.

14:54.956 --> 14:56.857
Like you, he's named Johnny.

14:56.891 --> 15:00.560
We call it
"johnny's bananas."

15:00.595 --> 15:02.262
that's not funny.

15:02.296 --> 15:04.331
It made me laugh.
Can you write a script?

15:04.365 --> 15:06.066
I already did an outline
while I was meditating.

15:06.100 --> 15:07.601
I just have to
transcribe it to paper.

15:07.635 --> 15:09.102
Great, what's it say?
Can you pitch it to us?

15:09.136 --> 15:11.938
Okay, so Johnny's
ex-wife is a nasty

15:11.973 --> 15:14.407
Little black widow
spider monkey named Julie.

15:14.442 --> 15:19.346
She's getting remarried
to a baboon named Ronald.

15:19.380 --> 15:21.882
It's a big ceremony.
It's the talk of the town.

15:21.916 --> 15:24.150
But when Johnny
stops paying alimony

15:24.185 --> 15:26.186
She tells him it was
only a love ceremony;

15:26.220 --> 15:29.256
That it's not legally
binding and that she's
taking him to court.

15:29.290 --> 15:32.425
And then Johnny goes bananas.

15:32.460 --> 15:34.628
tell me what happens.

15:34.662 --> 15:36.329
- Does he win?
- You'll have to read it.

15:36.364 --> 15:39.533
Who cares if he wins?
And I'm not reading it
'cause I lose.

15:41.068 --> 15:43.703
Are you making
fun of me, Billy?
Is that what you're doing?

15:43.738 --> 15:45.605
No, drama, I'm obsessed
with animation.

15:45.640 --> 15:48.708
You ever see "family guy"?
That dog Brian, he kills me.

15:48.743 --> 15:50.410
He kind of is me.
Was me.

15:50.444 --> 15:53.313
I mean, this stuff
moves people.

15:53.347 --> 15:55.448
And just imagine
how your plight

15:55.483 --> 15:59.219
As a misunderstood gorilla
can move countless angry men.

15:59.253 --> 16:01.488
I'm starting to get angry now!

16:01.522 --> 16:04.391
This is my first shot
at my own show

16:04.425 --> 16:07.827
And you want me to hide
behind a cartoon monkey.
And you're liking this?

16:07.862 --> 16:10.597
- I'm intrigued.
- Well, I'm not intrigued!

16:10.631 --> 16:13.366
Not even a little bit.
What a waste of my day.

16:13.401 --> 16:15.502
Drama!

16:18.072 --> 16:21.474
- What are you doing, Billy?
- That's what Johnny will do
when he gets angry.

16:21.509 --> 16:24.377
- You like it, right?
- I'm intrigued.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.747
Mark, I don't want you
to take this personally.

16:27.782 --> 16:29.282
Take what personally?

16:29.317 --> 16:31.318
You know those cases
of Tequila Vince
sent you?

16:31.352 --> 16:33.119
<i>- Yeah.
- We need 'em back.</i>

16:33.154 --> 16:35.021
<i>- What?
- No no, I'm serious.</i>

16:35.056 --> 16:36.656
We're calling everybody
we gave 'em to.

16:36.691 --> 16:38.892
What's there a botulism
recall on 'em or something?

16:38.926 --> 16:41.328
No, nothing like that.
We have a buyer

16:41.362 --> 16:43.563
That I promised to deliver to
but I can't get any in time.

16:43.598 --> 16:46.232
<i>At kind of rinky-dink
shit did you get Vince
involved with?</i>

16:46.267 --> 16:48.201
I told you invest
in the water company, dude.

16:48.235 --> 16:51.271
- Aquahydrate is blowing up.
- I know, I see it everywhere.

16:51.305 --> 16:53.773
Hey, Vinnie Chase is doing
a recall on his free Tequila.

16:53.808 --> 16:55.775
- Let me speak to him.
- Did you give Diddy some?

16:55.810 --> 16:58.712
You're in trouble.
He's here, hold on.
It's turtle.

16:58.746 --> 17:01.348
Hey, turtle, I told you
you should have had Vinnie

17:01.382 --> 17:03.183
Inst in ciroc when
I told you about it.

17:03.217 --> 17:05.218
<i>It's not too late
though, turtle.</i>

17:05.252 --> 17:08.855
- Doesn't sound like you're
doing too good with Tequila.

17:08.888 --> 17:11.523
Call Rob Baldwin, have him
pick it up at the house.

17:11.559 --> 17:14.928
But I want
my water back, all right?
Don't call me no more.

17:14.962 --> 17:17.097
- Oh, 23 cases.
- Great.

17:17.131 --> 17:19.065
- Yup.
- Who else did you
give 'em to?

17:19.099 --> 17:20.900
I sent 10 over
to James Cameron.

17:20.935 --> 17:23.502
- Can you call him?
- Mmm, no.

17:23.537 --> 17:25.271
It's the Terminator.

17:25.306 --> 17:27.840
Why do I have to give
this girl a job?

17:27.875 --> 17:30.343
Because I am asking you to
and because you can.

17:30.378 --> 17:32.912
- And you think
she'd be good for me?
- I know she would.

17:32.947 --> 17:35.682
- But she wasn't
good enough for you.
- She was great for me.

17:35.716 --> 17:38.218
- But you fired her.
- I didn't fire her,
she quit.

17:38.252 --> 17:40.520
- What is going on here?
- I need a favor.

17:40.554 --> 17:42.589
- I got...
- thanks.

17:42.623 --> 17:44.824
I got you your job, all right?

17:44.859 --> 17:46.660
So this is the least
you can do for me.

17:46.694 --> 17:49.496
What do you owe her, though?
Did you fuck her or something?

17:49.530 --> 17:52.632
What is the matter with you?
You were the last person
I was with before my wife.

17:52.667 --> 17:55.635
- No one since.
- Wow, that was over
20 years ago.

17:55.670 --> 17:58.038
You're actually
one of the good guys,

17:58.072 --> 17:59.439
Despite what they say.

17:59.473 --> 18:02.809
I need this, Dana,
or those naysayers may
be proven right.

18:02.843 --> 18:04.611
What does she have on you?

18:04.645 --> 18:06.746
She is a star.
That's all that matters.

18:06.781 --> 18:09.849
She's a TV Agent.
And what, you think that
she can run a studio?

18:09.884 --> 18:12.786
I was a TV Agent.
They offered me the job
to run this studio.

18:12.820 --> 18:14.954
The job that I gave you.
I need a favor.

18:14.989 --> 18:17.424
- Fine, I will meet her.
- Great.

18:17.458 --> 18:20.026
<i>- But I need a favor as well.
- Anything.</i>

18:20.061 --> 18:22.462
I want a baby.

18:22.496 --> 18:23.897
What?

18:23.931 --> 18:25.965
<i>I'm pushing 40,
I don't have a man.</i>

18:26.000 --> 18:29.035
I want a baby with your sperm.

18:30.771 --> 18:32.706
Seriously?

18:32.740 --> 18:35.608
no, I'm just fucking
with you.

18:35.643 --> 18:38.378
- I need sperm
with thicker hair.

18:38.412 --> 18:41.081
- Ah, so what do you need?
- Lenny Kravitz.

18:41.115 --> 18:43.683
- For what?
- You know Jim enders,
director?

18:43.718 --> 18:46.319
- The gay guy
that won Sundance.
- He's not gay.

18:46.353 --> 18:49.255
- Come on.
- He's not gay,
but even if he was...

18:49.290 --> 18:50.724
Okay, so what do you need?

18:50.758 --> 18:53.093
- I dated him.
- Okay, he's not gay!

18:53.127 --> 18:55.829
And he's directing
"true Violet."

18:55.863 --> 18:58.498
- What, the one
with Russell Crowe?
- And Charlize.

18:58.532 --> 19:00.500
- I didn't know that.
- It just happened.

19:00.534 --> 19:02.669
So he wants Lenny
to play a small part

19:02.703 --> 19:05.338
That he thinks
can steal the movie.
He's desperate.

19:05.372 --> 19:06.840
You know I put Lenny
in "precious"?

19:06.874 --> 19:08.408
- That's why I'm asking.
- Done.

19:08.442 --> 19:11.511
Done done done.

19:11.545 --> 19:14.981
- Then done.
- I love you, Dana.

19:15.015 --> 19:17.350
And if I ever cheat on my wife
it will be you I'm fucking.

19:17.384 --> 19:19.552
I look forward to it.

19:19.587 --> 19:21.121
It's Randall Wallace calling.

19:21.155 --> 19:23.656
Oh, great. Thanks.
This is about
the Vince meeting.

19:25.693 --> 19:27.393
Hello, Randall.

19:27.428 --> 19:29.429
How did it go?

19:29.463 --> 19:32.799
<i>- Well, that's good to hear.
Yeah, Randall's
a really good guy.</i>

19:32.833 --> 19:35.068
<i>- I think we're gonna have
a lot of fun on this one.
- Great.</i>

19:35.102 --> 19:36.503
What are you up to
for the rest of the day?

19:36.537 --> 19:38.371
Sasha and I are gonna
grab a bite to eat.

19:38.405 --> 19:40.440
<i>- All right, enjoy.
- Always.</i>

19:40.474 --> 19:42.442
I'll talk to you later.

19:42.476 --> 19:45.245
- He said the meeting
with Randall went great.
- Why wouldn't it?

19:45.279 --> 19:47.313
Now we just got
to deal with the other
Chase brother.

19:47.348 --> 19:49.482
I think this actually
could be pretty funny.

19:49.517 --> 19:51.818
Pretty funny?
With drama it'll kill.

19:51.852 --> 19:53.253
It literally looks like him.

19:53.287 --> 19:54.988
Billy, I didn't know
you were still here.

19:55.022 --> 19:57.891
Well, drama drove me
and then left, so where
else would I be?

19:57.925 --> 20:01.461
Hey, I wrote up that one pager
if you want to send it over
to your guy at the studio.

20:01.495 --> 20:03.463
I think we should probably
get drama onboard first.

20:03.497 --> 20:05.598
I think if the studio
likes it he'll jump.

20:05.633 --> 20:08.268
- You're probably right.
- Ari's calling for you.

20:08.302 --> 20:10.637
Great.

20:10.671 --> 20:11.871
Hey, what's up?

20:11.906 --> 20:13.773
<i>What the fuck
is going on?!</i>

20:13.808 --> 20:16.042
Hello to you too.
What's your fucking problem?

20:16.076 --> 20:19.512
My problem is that Wallace
is not happy about his
meeting with Vince.

20:19.547 --> 20:21.548
I just spoke to Vince.
He said the meeting
went great.

20:21.582 --> 20:23.917
- Did he?
- Yeah, why?
What did Randall say?

20:23.951 --> 20:26.119
He said he thought Vince
was on coke.

20:26.153 --> 20:28.321
<i>- What?
- That's what he said.</i>

20:28.355 --> 20:30.723
<i>- I hope you
told him he wasn't.
- Eric.</i>

20:30.758 --> 20:32.458
Ari, I've known
Vince for 30 years.

20:32.493 --> 20:34.194
He's never done coke
a day in his life.

20:34.228 --> 20:36.262
<i>Whether he has
or hasn't,</i>

20:36.297 --> 20:39.132
Wallace's impression
of him was not good.

20:39.166 --> 20:40.800
What's the studio's
impression of him?

20:40.835 --> 20:42.435
I'm waiting to hear
back from Dana on that.

20:42.469 --> 20:44.938
<i>- I'm gonna call Vince.
- I've left word for
him already.</i>

20:44.972 --> 20:48.641
- Let me know
if you hear from him.
- I'll talk to you later.

20:48.676 --> 20:51.578
- What was that?
- Randall thinks Vince was
on coke at the meeting.

20:51.612 --> 20:54.314
- Come on.
- I know, right?

20:54.348 --> 20:56.449
Maybe I should call Randall.

20:56.483 --> 20:58.852
Maybe you should
call Vince first.

21:00.421 --> 21:02.488
I don't even know why
I sent Pauly shore bottles,

21:02.523 --> 21:04.591
But that jerkoff should
have just sent them back.

21:04.625 --> 21:06.926
You've got 40 cases.
I'm sure it's gonna
be fine.

21:06.961 --> 21:09.329
I don't think so.

21:13.868 --> 21:16.769
- I'm sorry I couldn't
get you more, Randy.
- Yeah, me too. It's crazy.

21:16.804 --> 21:18.638
Everyone wants
the first bottles
sold in the States.

21:18.672 --> 21:20.240
I'm gonna get you more
as soon as possible.

21:20.274 --> 21:22.075
Any idea when that would be?

21:22.109 --> 21:24.477
Sitting down with
the big boss this week.
I'll find out.

21:24.511 --> 21:26.980
Well, if they like
the taste you might
have yourself a winner.

21:27.014 --> 21:29.249
Oh, they'll love the taste.
And I'm sure we have a winner.

21:29.283 --> 21:32.118
- All right, thanks again.
- Take care, man.

21:32.152 --> 21:34.487
- Who are you calling?
- The press;

21:34.521 --> 21:36.756
Create a little buzz.

21:38.058 --> 21:41.027
Hey, turtle, yo.
Is Vince coming
down for this?

21:41.061 --> 21:42.996
I don't know if he's gonna
have a chance to stop by,

21:43.030 --> 21:45.164
But you guys should buy
a bottle of this stuff
if you can get one.

21:45.199 --> 21:47.800
- Yeah?
You think it's that good?
- I know it is, Yori.

21:47.835 --> 21:49.602
- All right, thanks.
- Oh, use that piece,

21:49.637 --> 21:51.537
And I'll let you know
where Vince is next time
we go out.

21:51.572 --> 21:53.706
- Done.
- Later.

21:53.741 --> 21:56.309
I got a good feeling
you're gonna be able
to pay your rent.

21:58.112 --> 22:00.580
Lenny, it's a no-brainer.

22:00.614 --> 22:02.849
<i>- A no-brainer for who, Ari?
- For you.</i>

22:02.883 --> 22:05.385
Two scenes with Russell Crowe,
are you kidding me?

22:05.419 --> 22:08.788
- Did you read the scenes?
- I don't need to read them.

22:08.822 --> 22:11.557
<i>The director's passion
for you is unmistakable.</i>

22:11.592 --> 22:13.026
He's an up-and-comer.

22:13.060 --> 22:15.528
If you want this acting thing
to become more than a hobby,

22:15.562 --> 22:17.497
Then you step up and do this.
Trust me.

22:17.531 --> 22:19.065
- Read the scenes.
- Why?

22:19.099 --> 22:22.201
Because there's
no dialogue, Ari.
I'm shirtless with a guitar.

22:22.236 --> 22:24.404
I think the director
wants to fuck me.

22:24.438 --> 22:26.172
Lenny, he dated
a girlfriend of mine.

22:26.206 --> 22:28.908
Look, I can
turn the best of the
either way, I'm not doing it.

22:28.943 --> 22:30.677
<i>- Lenny!
- I've got to go.
I'm in temple.</i>

22:30.711 --> 22:32.245
It's my niece's
bat mitzvah Saturday

22:32.279 --> 22:34.047
And I've got to help
her get her voice right.

22:37.117 --> 22:40.053
All right, man.
Hey, Ari, I've got to go.

22:41.989 --> 22:43.823
Lizzie grant's waiting.

22:46.760 --> 22:48.294
Thank you for running over.

22:48.329 --> 22:49.762
You really delivered that fast.

22:49.797 --> 22:52.231
I thought that I did
when I called.

22:52.266 --> 22:55.868
And I still think that
I will, but I haven't yet.

22:57.705 --> 22:59.205
I'm sorry.

22:59.239 --> 23:01.541
I am as well.

23:01.575 --> 23:03.443
Do what you can.

23:03.477 --> 23:04.911
Really?

23:07.648 --> 23:09.649
I don't want
I shto blackmail my way
thisinto a job.St place.

23:09.683 --> 23:11.985
This whole thing is
starting to eat away
at my insides.

23:12.019 --> 23:15.254
Nothing but respect
from here on out.

23:15.289 --> 23:17.256
Thanks, Ari.

23:17.291 --> 23:19.258
Good luck.

23:27.334 --> 23:29.168
Did you ever make it on
with the n.F.L. People?

23:29.203 --> 23:32.572
Oh no.
Get my new partners
on the phone.

23:39.680 --> 23:41.881
- Are you okay?
- More than okay, Babs.

23:41.915 --> 23:44.083
More than okay.
Lizzie gave me the tapes.

23:44.118 --> 23:47.720
- That's great, but... but...
- but what?

23:47.755 --> 23:50.223
Did you not see
"deadline Hollywood"?

23:50.257 --> 23:51.791
No.

23:51.825 --> 23:54.794
Somebody told Anna Fowler
what was on the tapes.

23:54.828 --> 23:56.696
<i>- Amanda?
- I don't know.</i>

23:56.730 --> 23:58.831
But it's bad.

23:58.866 --> 24:01.234
I'm sorry, Ari.

24:09.810 --> 24:12.145
<i>I've got Jerry Jones
and your wife both calling.</i>

24:12.212 --> 24:15.081
<i>Ari?</i>

24:15.115 --> 24:17.083
Ari?

24:18.719 --> 24:21.387
Jerry Jones.

24:29.663 --> 24:32.031
Jerry, how are you?

24:32.066 --> 24:33.800
Better than you, it seems.

24:33.834 --> 24:35.868
I've just gotten off the phone
with our publicist.

24:35.903 --> 24:38.237
It's all lies and rumors,
my friend.

24:38.272 --> 24:39.806
Listen, I can clean it all up.

24:39.840 --> 24:41.240
It doesn't matter.

24:41.275 --> 24:43.543
I don't do scandal.
The n.F.L. Doesn't do scandal.

24:43.577 --> 24:46.079
<i>It's too bad.
We were excited about this.</i>

24:46.113 --> 24:49.148
- So was I.
- Good luck with this thing.

24:50.684 --> 24:52.552
Thank you.

24:54.221 --> 24:56.422
You wife's still on hold.
Should I put her through?

24:56.457 --> 24:58.891
- jeez, your phone's
blowing up.

24:58.926 --> 25:00.793
Something's going on.

25:03.397 --> 25:04.897
Oh my God.

25:04.932 --> 25:07.767
His wife must be freaking out.

25:07.801 --> 25:09.235
Yeah, I'm sure.

25:09.269 --> 25:11.437
What would you say if you
read that stuff about me?

25:11.472 --> 25:13.172
I don't know.

25:13.207 --> 25:15.308
Is there even a chance
that could happen?

25:15.342 --> 25:17.176
I don't think so, no.

25:19.179 --> 25:21.647
It's Vince, finally.
Vince, where the hell
have you been?

25:21.682 --> 25:24.484
We decided to
drive up the coast.
We didn't have any service.

25:24.518 --> 25:27.420
<i>- We've got a problem.
- What now?</i>

25:27.454 --> 25:29.422
Wallace thinks you were
on coke at the meeting.

25:29.456 --> 25:31.090
<i>- What?
- Yeah, Dana's freaking out.</i>

25:31.125 --> 25:33.292
<i>- He told that to the studio?
- Yes.</i>

25:33.327 --> 25:35.394
And what did you say?

25:35.429 --> 25:36.963
Ari told me, I told him no way.

25:36.997 --> 25:38.698
Well, I hope Ari
sets them straight.

25:38.732 --> 25:41.067
- He's got his own
problems right now, Vince.
- Oh, really?

25:41.101 --> 25:44.203
<i>- Vince, you said
the meeting went great.
- I thought it did.</i>

25:44.238 --> 25:46.772
I mean, maybe I was
a little nervous.

25:46.807 --> 25:49.208
<i>And I was tired
so I drank a lot of coffee.</i>

25:49.243 --> 25:52.745
I can't believe he called
the studio without telling me
right to my face.

25:52.779 --> 25:54.881
I'll call Dana and tell her
I've known you 30 years;

25:54.915 --> 25:58.084
- I've never seen you do coke.
- Okay.

25:58.118 --> 25:59.986
Thanks.

26:00.020 --> 26:01.721
I'm sure it'll be fine.

26:01.755 --> 26:03.789
<i>- You sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.</i>

26:03.824 --> 26:06.325
Look, e,
I'll see you on Monday.

26:06.360 --> 26:09.729
- All will be well.
- Okay, I'll talk to you later.

26:09.763 --> 26:12.932
- You're bad.
- Why?

26:12.966 --> 26:14.901
You totally just lied to him.

26:14.935 --> 26:17.737
No, I said all will be
well and it will be.
