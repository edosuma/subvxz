01:14.242 --> 01:16.244
- Hang on.
- Come on.

01:18.078 --> 01:21.682
Watch out for her hair.
Watch on that hair. Will you?

01:27.555 --> 01:29.523
Come on! Let's wrestle.
Let's go.

01:29.590 --> 01:33.026
Are you crazy?
Do your job.

01:33.093 --> 01:36.330
You better stay
out of this, lady.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.699
- She's not choking her.
- I know, I know.

01:38.766 --> 01:41.369
Baby, hang in there.
Hang in there.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.305
'Alright. You got it.
Come on.'

01:44.372 --> 01:46.974
Just stay out of here.
Just stay out of here.

01:47.040 --> 01:49.243
Get out..
One, two, three.

01:50.644 --> 01:54.215
'Beautiful. California Dolls.'

01:54.282 --> 01:56.049
'Go get 'em honey.'

01:56.116 --> 01:57.751
- Go get her.
- Come on. Let's go.

01:57.818 --> 02:00.621
- Come on, stop that.
- She's chokin' her.

02:00.688 --> 02:04.525
Choke! Come on, ref.
Hey, hey!

02:04.592 --> 02:08.196
Let's go. Call it.
How could you not call this?

02:09.562 --> 02:12.566
- 'Move on'
- No holding.

02:13.767 --> 02:17.104
What are you waiting for.
Come on!

02:17.171 --> 02:20.474
- 'Oh, that's cool.'
- That's enough.

02:41.595 --> 02:45.499
'We want The Dolls.'

02:54.242 --> 02:56.610
We want The Dolls.

03:04.418 --> 03:07.388
- $250.
- It's $240.

03:07.455 --> 03:09.423
I'll let you have
the girls for Thanksgiving.

03:09.490 --> 03:12.326
Same price as tonight.

03:12.393 --> 03:14.762
Think about it.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.297
Can't help ya.

03:18.399 --> 03:22.202
Rhody, if you ever need
a friend...buy a dog.

03:29.009 --> 03:31.645
- Doc, you got a minute?
- Yeah.

03:31.712 --> 03:34.848
Hope I didn't slug
your friend out there too hard.

03:34.915 --> 03:36.650
Who? You mean, Harry?

03:36.717 --> 03:39.687
Listen, it's the best thing
that happened to him all week.

03:39.753 --> 03:43.557
Sorry we had to win but nice
to work with you guys anyway.

03:43.624 --> 03:45.859
- See you later. Take care.
- Bye, bye.

03:45.926 --> 03:50.331
What a fantastic show
you girls put on tonight.

03:50.398 --> 03:52.833
- Pretty good, huh?
- No, not good, darling.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.235
- It was sensational.
- The audience loved us--

03:55.303 --> 03:59.740
No. They didn't love you.
They ate it up. They loved it.

03:59.807 --> 04:02.142
- Are we getting Thanksgiving?
- I'm negotiating.

04:02.209 --> 04:03.777
Does that mean
he doesn't want us?

04:03.844 --> 04:06.414
No, it's not that.
I'm asking a lot of money.

04:06.480 --> 04:08.316
Well, are we gonna get it?

04:08.382 --> 04:11.452
Depends, I still
gotta push some buttons.

04:11.519 --> 04:15.389
Hey, honey. You look better
with your clothes off.

04:15.456 --> 04:17.156
I didn't know
you were bilingual.

04:17.224 --> 04:18.791
So we're not getting
Thanksgiving.

04:18.858 --> 04:20.894
It's-it's gonna be tough.
It's uphill.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.997
- I'm not gonna lie to you.
- This is the pits!

04:24.064 --> 04:26.834
- What do you've to do--
- Yeah, what do you've to do?

04:26.900 --> 04:29.136
Gotta walk on water
to get a $12 raise.

04:29.202 --> 04:32.840
- Every path has its pace.
- Every path, your ass!

04:32.906 --> 04:35.543
A hard beginning
maketh a good ending.

04:35.609 --> 04:38.512
Harry, do me a favor
and take that some place else

04:38.579 --> 04:40.714
'cause I'm not in the mood.

04:43.351 --> 04:44.952
Anybody hungry?

04:48.722 --> 04:50.958
I said is anybody hungry?

04:52.726 --> 04:55.763
What is this? A school
for the deaf and dumb?

05:00.233 --> 05:02.836
Nobody hungry?
I'm buying.

05:04.672 --> 05:07.575
Hey, I'm not kidding around.
I'm really buying.

05:07.641 --> 05:10.010
Real food or that junk garbage
we have every night?

05:10.077 --> 05:13.781
No, no. Five blocks up the road,
there's a brand new Fatburger.

05:13.847 --> 05:15.983
It's fantastic.

05:16.049 --> 05:19.553
For once, can't we eat
at a place with a tablecloth?

05:19.620 --> 05:22.690
Hm, it's okay with me,
but those frills cost money.

05:24.692 --> 05:27.695
'Don't you think it's about time
we got a new muffler?'

05:27.761 --> 05:31.532
- 'Just remember.'
- 'Those frills cost money.'

05:59.727 --> 06:01.729
'How much longer?'

06:01.795 --> 06:04.598
'How much longer?'

06:04.665 --> 06:08.469
'Longer than a breath,
shorter than a lifetime.'

06:08.536 --> 06:11.905
Could you give
that to me in miles?

06:11.972 --> 06:14.975
There was a crooked man.
He walked a crooked mile.

06:15.042 --> 06:18.546
- He found a crooked--
- Keep it up, Harry.

06:18.612 --> 06:21.882
- Trying to entertain you.
- Try silence.

06:21.949 --> 06:24.818
'Why don't we stop
and get some candy?'

06:24.885 --> 06:27.621
'Candy is dandy.
Liquor is quicker.'

06:27.688 --> 06:29.389
'Give us a break.
Will you?'

06:29.457 --> 06:32.560
'A conversation with you is like
talking to a fortune cookie.'

06:32.626 --> 06:35.663
What's it with all these things?
Where do you get 'em all?

06:35.729 --> 06:38.632
You know, that's
a very interesting story.

06:38.699 --> 06:41.068
When my parents came over
here from the old country

06:41.134 --> 06:44.572
the only thing my father knew
how to do was be a tailor.

06:44.638 --> 06:48.576
So he got a job as a tailor,
cutting pants and vests.

06:48.642 --> 06:50.578
They wouldn't let him
cut coats.

06:50.644 --> 06:52.646
He knew he had
to become a citizen

06:52.713 --> 06:54.682
in order to stay
in the country.

06:54.748 --> 06:57.785
He couldn't speak English.
Not one word.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.620
So the union
sent him to school.

06:59.687 --> 07:02.055
Maybe that's what
we need, a union.

07:02.122 --> 07:06.760
Better pay, better conditions,
and no managers.

07:06.827 --> 07:09.597
Now at school, they explained
to him you have five years

07:09.663 --> 07:11.632
to learn the answers
to some simple questions

07:11.699 --> 07:13.867
and he had to learn
how to speak English.

07:13.934 --> 07:18.238
So my father asked them, "How am
I gonna learn to speak English?"

07:18.305 --> 07:20.841
Teacher says, "Very simple.

07:20.908 --> 07:25.579
You read New York Times,
Clifford Odets and Will Rogers."

07:25.646 --> 07:26.880
So what happened?

07:26.947 --> 07:28.749
So, for the rest of his life

07:28.816 --> 07:32.586
my father read New York Times,
Will Rogers, and Clifford Odets.

07:32.653 --> 07:34.622
And in five years,
he become a citizen.

07:34.688 --> 07:37.257
What does that have
to do with the way you talk?

07:37.324 --> 07:40.293
When my sister and I
got old enough to ask questions

07:40.360 --> 07:42.630
any question..

07:42.696 --> 07:45.365
...my father, he always
answered with a quote.

07:45.432 --> 07:47.868
From either Rogers or Odets.

07:47.935 --> 07:50.470
Who were Rogers and Odets?

07:50.538 --> 07:53.073
Rogers and Odets?

07:55.375 --> 07:59.647
They're a dance team.
They worked in the Catskills.

08:24.137 --> 08:27.040
- 'How you feeling?'
- Come on. Come on.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.943
- 'How you feeling?'
- Hair, hair up.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.890
'Oh, she's choking her.'

08:43.957 --> 08:47.294
Bite her. Bite
the son of a bitch.

08:51.398 --> 08:53.834
Get up.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.269
Chin up. Don't choke. Give up!

08:59.873 --> 09:01.609
Legs and ass. Kick out.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.282
- 'Kick out.'
- Kick out.

09:14.354 --> 09:15.823
Get up! Get up!

09:18.158 --> 09:19.827
I'm hurt!

09:24.898 --> 09:27.134
Take a deep breath.
Deep breath.

09:27.200 --> 09:29.102
Is there a doctor
in the house?

09:29.169 --> 09:31.739
Get a doctor.
This girl's in pain.

09:31.805 --> 09:34.074
You gotta move.
You gotta roll.

09:34.141 --> 09:37.244
- You can't fall--
- Shh, shh. Leave me alone.

09:37.310 --> 09:40.447
Feet and shoulders.
How many times do I tell you?

09:40.513 --> 09:43.817
- Oh, God! What? Get away.
- Where does it hurt?

09:43.884 --> 09:45.953
My ribs. I think
I broke a couple.

09:46.019 --> 09:50.357
Your ribs? Don't move.
I said don't move. Molly will..

09:50.423 --> 09:53.360
Molly, you're on your own.
You move, I'll kill you.

09:53.426 --> 09:57.330
Molly, you gotta watch the flip.
Watch the sunset flip.

10:32.766 --> 10:36.069
One, two, three..

10:39.773 --> 10:43.811
There's no bones broken.
Just maybe a bad sprain.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.879
Stay off your back
for a few days.

10:45.946 --> 10:48.081
There goes your
social life, Iris.

10:48.148 --> 10:51.351
- She's as healthy as a horse.
- Right. And you ought to know.

10:51.418 --> 10:53.821
He used to be
the official vet of Pimlico.

10:53.887 --> 10:56.356
- Very funny.
- Stay in here a minute, Doc.

10:56.423 --> 10:58.325
I wanna talk to you.

10:58.391 --> 11:01.161
You're way ahead. You're lucky
he didn't shoot you.

11:02.830 --> 11:04.832
Listen, while you're here,
I got a problem--

11:04.898 --> 11:05.899
What's the problem?

11:05.966 --> 11:07.567
- Are you okay?
- I guess so.

11:07.634 --> 11:10.838
As Harry would say, that guy
should be a bone specialist.

11:10.904 --> 11:13.306
He's got the hip for it.

11:13.373 --> 11:16.977
Excuse me. You the manager
for the California Dolls?

11:17.044 --> 11:18.078
Yeah. Why?

11:18.145 --> 11:19.913
Well, they're really
very good, you know.

11:19.980 --> 11:21.448
I know.
What's the deal?

11:21.514 --> 11:23.016
Nothing really except

11:23.083 --> 11:25.853
if you ever wanna bring
your girls to Japan to wrestle

11:25.919 --> 11:27.721
I'd like to arrange a tour.

11:27.788 --> 11:29.823
Why would you wanna do that?

11:29.890 --> 11:31.892
If your girls ever
get to be champions

11:31.959 --> 11:34.962
I think we could make
a lot of money together.

11:35.028 --> 11:37.865
Your girls will be
very, very big in Japan.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.435
Here.

11:46.473 --> 11:49.009
Hm...this you?

11:49.076 --> 11:52.479
Yeah. Clyde Yamashito.

11:52.545 --> 11:55.315
- Pleasure meeting you, sir.
- Likewise.

11:55.382 --> 11:57.717
Lookin' forward to
doing business with ya.

11:57.785 --> 12:00.553
Here, why don't you
try one of these?

12:00.620 --> 12:02.589
You'll feel better
in no time.

12:02.655 --> 12:06.459
- It's quite a collection.
- Well, it pays to be prepared.

12:06.526 --> 12:08.929
Never know where
it's gonna hurt tomorrow.

12:08.996 --> 12:10.430
Any suggestions?

12:10.497 --> 12:13.666
Mm, why don't you try
one of the pink ones.

12:13.733 --> 12:17.704
There might not be a tomorrow
if you keep taking these.

12:17.771 --> 12:21.809
- Does it make a difference?
- Yes, it makes a difference.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.443
Doesn't it?

12:25.979 --> 12:28.748
Yeah, it makes
a difference.

12:37.724 --> 12:40.928
- Come in.
- Harry.

12:41.862 --> 12:43.797
Your money is on the desk.

12:43.864 --> 12:47.467
How's the girl?

12:47.534 --> 12:49.002
Oh, she's just great.

12:55.475 --> 12:57.210
You're short 20.

12:57.277 --> 13:00.580
Harry, we charge
towel and linen service.

13:00.647 --> 13:03.050
What kinda crap is that?

13:03.116 --> 13:05.018
Harry, you got your money.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.453
Your girls are probably beat.

13:06.519 --> 13:08.188
Why don't you be a big sport

13:08.255 --> 13:10.623
and get 'em a cup of coffee
or something?

13:10.690 --> 13:12.159
You're short 20, Eddie.

13:12.225 --> 13:15.228
Our girls are a class act.
They deserve to get paid.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.665
If I wanted a class act,
I'd get the Bronte sisters.

13:21.869 --> 13:25.305
My dolls would tear
their legs off.

13:25.372 --> 13:28.876
Harry, I don't have to tell you
the business is changing.

13:28.942 --> 13:32.112
I gotta give a piece of the
action to unions, concessions.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.747
- That requires--
- You break my heart, Eddie.

13:34.814 --> 13:37.150
I'm not leaving
until I get the 20.

13:37.217 --> 13:40.187
Can't help ya. Wanna call Cisco
a son of a bitch.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.755
Yeah, call me a son of a bitch.

13:42.822 --> 13:45.792
'I gave up a long time ago
tryin' to please everybody.'

13:45.859 --> 13:47.560
Girls earned the money.
I want it.

13:47.627 --> 13:51.464
Be happy you got what you got.
'Cause that's all you gonna get.

13:51.531 --> 13:54.101
The only reason you had anybody
in this toilet tonight

13:54.167 --> 13:55.936
was because of my Dolls.

13:56.003 --> 13:58.138
That crowd out there
came to see them.

13:58.205 --> 14:01.208
I'll level with you. You have
a couple of sweet numbers there.

14:01.274 --> 14:03.276
But the customers
don't give a damn.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.312
'All they want
is tits and ass.'

14:05.378 --> 14:08.882
Don't matter if it's your broads
or someone else's broads.

14:10.650 --> 14:13.553
Look, you cheap bastard. $20
means something to my girls.

14:13.620 --> 14:17.824
To you, it's nothing. It's
banana money for your gorilla.

14:17.891 --> 14:22.195
Ok, big mouth.
You know who I am?

14:22.262 --> 14:23.964
Alright, Eddie. Impress me.

14:24.031 --> 14:26.599
I promote over 20 arenas
in this area alone.

14:26.666 --> 14:28.068
I'm leaving this area.

14:28.135 --> 14:30.303
Harry, I don't care
if you leave the planet.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.606
You're never gonna work
for me again.

14:48.755 --> 14:50.557
'Harry, ooh.'

14:52.225 --> 14:55.428
- Be seein' ya.
- Hey, don't move.

14:56.663 --> 15:01.101
I wanna forget you
just the way you are.

15:06.673 --> 15:08.741
Hey, boss.

15:08.808 --> 15:12.445
Really think he didn't remember
anything about the towel fee?

15:12.512 --> 15:13.380
Shut up, Jerome.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.316
Harry, what's wrong with you?

15:17.717 --> 15:19.886
Was he acting weird
tonight, I tell you.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.222
Hey, what happened in there?

15:22.289 --> 15:25.458
Hey, did you get the money?

15:25.525 --> 15:28.328
- 'Why are we stopping?'
- 'What are we looking for?'

15:28.395 --> 15:30.630
'Would you please tell us
what happened?'

15:34.634 --> 15:36.503
What is wrong with you?

15:36.569 --> 15:39.472
Harry, how much money
did he give you tonight?

15:39.539 --> 15:40.840
What, huh?

15:40.907 --> 15:42.675
Hey, what you doin'
with a bat?

15:42.742 --> 15:45.245
Don't do anything you're gonna
regret later, Harry.

15:45.312 --> 15:49.316
- 'Harry, this is crazy.'
- 'This is a real mistake.'

15:49.382 --> 15:52.619
Harry. Harry,
what are you gonna do?

15:52.685 --> 15:55.188
- 'You're lookin' for trouble.'
- 'Will you listen to me?'

15:55.255 --> 15:57.724
Harry, didn't he give you
all the money?

15:57.790 --> 15:59.759
'Why won't you tell us
what's going on?'

15:59.826 --> 16:02.429
'You're playin' around
with the wrong guy.'

16:03.963 --> 16:05.565
'Come on, Harry.
Don't do it.'

16:05.632 --> 16:08.001
- Harry, don't you dare.
- 'You're not--'

16:09.669 --> 16:10.770
'I don't believe this.'

16:14.774 --> 16:16.543
'Oh my God!'

16:28.055 --> 16:29.889
What was that
all about?

16:29.956 --> 16:33.293
I was thinking
about buying a Mercedes.

16:33.360 --> 16:35.995
But first I wanted
to give it a stress test.

16:36.063 --> 16:39.632
- Stress test?
- Didn't pass.

16:41.401 --> 16:47.774
You're crazy, Harry.
Absolutely, certifiably...crazy.

16:53.480 --> 16:55.648
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to wake you up.

16:55.715 --> 16:58.418
Ah, it's okay,
I can't sleep either.

17:00.587 --> 17:02.255
What's bothering you?

17:02.322 --> 17:04.156
Wondering what's
still bothering you.

17:04.223 --> 17:06.358
I've never seen you
smoke before.

17:11.397 --> 17:14.501
I honestly don't know
if I can take this anymore.

17:14.567 --> 17:15.801
Molly.

17:15.867 --> 17:18.471
All we're doing is
running around in circles.

17:18.538 --> 17:20.473
We're not getting any place.

17:20.540 --> 17:24.644
- I know it seems that way but--
- It is that way.

17:26.279 --> 17:28.248
So, you're gonna give up?

17:28.315 --> 17:32.752
No. I'm not gonna give up.

17:32.819 --> 17:37.924
Get out maybe...while I'm
stillin one piece.

17:37.990 --> 17:40.427
And do what?
Go back to LA?

17:41.528 --> 17:43.496
Maybe, I can get
my old job back.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.532
- At the answering service?
- Yeah.

17:45.598 --> 17:48.101
You're dreaming, Mol.
That's not how it was.

17:49.102 --> 17:51.238
I only said maybe.

17:54.941 --> 17:58.211
For all I know, I could-could
get into real estate

17:58.278 --> 18:02.449
or...or advertising maybe.

18:03.416 --> 18:05.552
Even work in an art gallery.

18:09.222 --> 18:12.992
So what if I didn't
finish high school?

18:13.059 --> 18:15.195
Can always go to night school.

18:16.963 --> 18:18.265
Nobody to come home to.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.300
Nobody to give a damn
what you do.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.634
Whereas, now, I've got you

18:21.701 --> 18:24.271
and that son of a bitch
to come home to.

18:24.337 --> 18:28.175
Yeah, and we need you, Mol.

18:29.742 --> 18:33.580
Hey, I couldn't work
with anybody but you.

18:33.646 --> 18:36.916
And who, but you,
could put up with Harry?

18:36.983 --> 18:39.952
Like it or not,
the three of us are a team

18:40.019 --> 18:42.322
and we're gonna make it
or die tryin'.

18:44.391 --> 18:48.261
I love you, Mol...and so does
the son of a bitch.

18:50.763 --> 18:53.266
He'll never admit it,
but he does.

18:58.171 --> 18:59.606
Okay.

19:03.343 --> 19:05.912
Turn out the light,
go to sleep.

19:27.834 --> 19:30.203
'They're the hottest
tag team in the state.'

19:30.270 --> 19:32.004
'I can't explain it myself.'

19:32.071 --> 19:35.275
'The other night in Akron, they
couldn't get out of the arena.'

19:35.342 --> 19:38.911
'They're like rock stars
and beautiful.'

19:38.978 --> 19:40.513
'First, listen,
face facts.'

19:40.580 --> 19:42.549
'We both know most
lady wrestlers are dogs.'

19:42.615 --> 19:44.551
'So, now they expect
the Pekingese'

19:44.617 --> 19:46.953
'and out comes Marilyn Monroe.
They go wild.'

19:47.019 --> 19:49.155
'Dogs. I'll settle for dogs.'

19:49.222 --> 19:51.724
'I just want to fill out
the card!'

19:51.791 --> 19:53.993
'What're you talking about?
Dogs are winners.'

19:54.060 --> 19:56.095
'Talk about a winning act.'

19:56.162 --> 19:59.432
'Winners, I don't need.
Any douche slappers will do!'

19:59.499 --> 20:01.468
You're gonna have
to do better than that.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.035
I'm talking about a class act.

20:03.102 --> 20:06.306
Tell you what I'll do? A hundred
and a quarter for tonight.

20:06.373 --> 20:09.276
That's the deal and that's it.

20:10.910 --> 20:13.145
- I'm on the phone.
- 'It's me.'

20:13.212 --> 20:14.981
I'd love to make
a deal with you.

20:15.047 --> 20:19.352
'But unless you sweeten the pot,
I'm gonna have to take a pass.'

20:19.419 --> 20:21.688
Do you want your coffee
or don't you?

20:21.754 --> 20:25.224
Uh, hold on a minute.
He's my man.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.173
You're not even offering
expenses.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.142
A hundred and a quarter.
That's it.

20:43.209 --> 20:47.414
Hey, we waited this long,
we'll wait a little longer.

20:47.480 --> 20:50.383
Then we won't need you.

20:50.450 --> 20:53.386
Lousy, no good son of a bitch.

20:53.453 --> 20:55.288
You quoting
Rogers and Odets again?

20:55.355 --> 20:58.358
Who's a lousy,
no-good son of a bitch?

20:58.425 --> 21:01.193
Never mind. What can you expect
from a day that starts

21:01.260 --> 21:02.862
with gettin' up in the morning?

21:02.929 --> 21:04.997
Sounded like you turned
somethin' down.

21:05.064 --> 21:08.100
Unlike you, Iris, I occasionally
turn down an offer.

21:08.167 --> 21:09.902
Don't start in on me, Harry.

21:09.969 --> 21:12.204
All I'm saying is you could
consult us sometimes.

21:12.271 --> 21:15.174
I didn't get us this far
by consulting you every time.

21:15.241 --> 21:18.645
Where are the car keys? Mol and
I are going out for breakfast.

21:18.711 --> 21:21.448
You two eatin' again?
You just ate last night.

21:21.514 --> 21:23.483
Sorry, old habits
are hard to break.

21:23.550 --> 21:25.818
In the back pocket.

21:25.885 --> 21:29.422
Okay, Harry, come on.
I put the bubble bath in.

21:35.061 --> 21:37.697
Oh, excuse me.

21:40.833 --> 21:43.670
You always were attracted
to shy girls, Harry.

21:43.736 --> 21:46.573
Alright, Iris.
Give me a break.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.510
- You a friend of Harry's too?
- Oh, isn't everyone?

21:50.577 --> 21:53.245
Isn't Harry
the absolute greatest?

21:53.312 --> 21:55.615
Yes, he certainly is.

21:55.682 --> 21:57.850
You heard the lady.
Eat your heart out.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.218
Now take a walk.

21:59.285 --> 22:01.921
Just leaving.
It was nice seeing you.

22:01.988 --> 22:02.989
Same here.

22:03.055 --> 22:05.525
Harry, Robert Redford
called again.

22:05.592 --> 22:07.594
Now, I told him you
couldn't be disturbed.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.129
You mean, you really
do know him?

22:10.196 --> 22:13.800
- Iris, out.
- Just leaving.

22:13.866 --> 22:17.804
'Like you always say, Harry,
familiarity breeds contempt..'

22:19.305 --> 22:21.774
...and children.
Ta ta.

22:24.544 --> 22:26.613
What is Robert Redford
really like?

22:26.679 --> 22:29.749
Oh, he's a regular guy.
You know, like you and me.

22:29.816 --> 22:32.018
Down to earth.
Rob is not a snob.

22:32.084 --> 22:34.454
- 'What's his favorite food?'
- Come here, quick. Come here.

22:34.521 --> 22:38.357
'None. No interest in food.
An occasional sardine.'

22:40.192 --> 22:42.929
- 'So, what happened?'
- 'Happened to whom?'

22:42.995 --> 22:44.597
'To your father.'

22:44.664 --> 22:47.467
'He kept quotin'
Rogers and Odets.'

22:47.534 --> 22:52.472
'And finally he got to cut
coats. Then he died.'

22:52.539 --> 22:55.942
'Aw. So, what happened
to you mother and sister?'

22:56.008 --> 22:58.545
'Ma's in a nursing home
in Newark.'

22:59.912 --> 23:02.381
'She don't remember anybody.'

23:04.183 --> 23:06.753
'My sister..'

23:06.819 --> 23:10.557
'...she married an Italian baker
that lived in Queens.'

23:10.623 --> 23:14.060
'If you want bread,
marry a baker, right.'

23:14.126 --> 23:17.497
'That's a sad story, Harry.'

23:17.564 --> 23:19.298
'Well, as Clifford Odets
would say

23:19.365 --> 23:21.801
'It's better than stickin'
a pencil in your eye.'

23:21.868 --> 23:24.036
'So why are you calling me?'

23:24.103 --> 23:26.706
Uh, because, Solly,
I've got two

23:26.773 --> 23:31.310
of the most sensational kids
to ever hit this business.

23:31.377 --> 23:34.714
- Yeah? Guys or girls?
- Two girls.

23:34.781 --> 23:37.016
Who are they?
Old girlfriends?

23:38.551 --> 23:40.920
No, it's absolutely
legitimate, Solly.

23:40.987 --> 23:42.789
Yeah, what's the name
of the act?

23:42.855 --> 23:47.560
- The California Dolls.
- Oh yeah, the sexy broads.

23:47.627 --> 23:49.862
- 'Same ones.'
- Never heard of them.

23:49.929 --> 23:53.399
Of course, you heard
of them. They're outstanding.

23:53.466 --> 23:56.636
Now here's the thing, Solly,
these kids got that stuff.

23:56.703 --> 24:00.272
They got a magic.
They're like rock stars.

24:00.339 --> 24:03.476
Believe me the audience
goes crazy.

24:03.543 --> 24:05.612
They've got beauty
and they've got talent.

24:05.678 --> 24:08.414
- Call me in the summer.
- When?

24:08.481 --> 24:11.350
- 'June.'
- June?

24:11.417 --> 24:13.520
I can't call you in June, Solly.

24:13.586 --> 24:15.387
Christ, that's eight
months away.

24:15.454 --> 24:16.689
June.

24:19.058 --> 24:21.661
Son of a...bitch!

24:21.728 --> 24:23.863
Want some chocolate?

24:23.930 --> 24:26.465
No thanks, that junk
just gives you calories.

24:26.533 --> 24:27.734
Let's go.

24:28.768 --> 24:30.570
Did you get me
a 3 Musketeer?

24:30.637 --> 24:32.238
Didn't have any.
I got you Snickers.

24:32.304 --> 24:35.742
I don't want a Snicker!
I asked for a 3 Musketeer!

24:35.808 --> 24:38.645
What are you, eight years old?
Have some of my M&M's.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.713
I hate M&M's!

24:45.451 --> 24:48.788
- That'll be 29.91.
- Wonderful.

24:53.893 --> 24:58.030
- Now here's 25. Who's got five?
- It's your turn.

24:58.097 --> 25:00.466
This is getting
to be a habit, you know.

25:00.533 --> 25:02.769
Well, we all have
different habits.

25:02.835 --> 25:08.575
- Here's a five.
- Alright, that makes thirty.

25:08.641 --> 25:11.177
There's your five cents.
I have no pennies.

25:11.243 --> 25:13.212
I'll have to go inside.

25:13.279 --> 25:14.747
I'll wait.

25:17.283 --> 25:19.251
Give me the nickel, Harry.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.521
Thank you.

25:29.596 --> 25:31.731
'What about the pennies, Harry?'

25:31.798 --> 25:34.834
'Where there's no sense,
there's no feeling.'

25:34.901 --> 25:36.636
'You know girls,
those Japanese wrestlers'

25:36.703 --> 25:38.404
'really put on a great show.'

25:38.470 --> 25:41.273
'And I keep telling you, you
better learn that sunset flip.'

25:41.340 --> 25:43.910
'It's real flashy
and wipes them out.'

25:43.976 --> 25:46.512
'Molly, she could have
pinned you twice with that.'

25:46.579 --> 25:49.849
'You were lucky
you hit the ropes.'

25:49.916 --> 25:51.718
That's a bad cough
you got there.

25:51.784 --> 25:55.221
You really ought to do
something about that.

26:02.194 --> 26:05.564
There's no harm in appreciating
other forms of music.

26:05.632 --> 26:07.199
Now, this is
an Italian tenor.

26:07.266 --> 26:11.437
His name is Attilio Belfiori,
and the opera is Pagliacci.

26:11.503 --> 26:13.105
It's beautiful.
Listen to it.

26:13.172 --> 26:16.042
- It'll make you cry.
- I'm crying already.

26:16.108 --> 26:18.377
- What did Solly say?
- 'Solly said maybe.'

26:20.212 --> 26:23.650
'Harry, the smoke and this cold
are killing me.'

26:23.716 --> 26:25.484
'You can make a fortune selling'

26:25.551 --> 26:26.953
'thermal underwear
in this state.'

26:27.019 --> 26:29.388
Does that mean Solly
is coming to see us?

26:29.455 --> 26:32.792
No, it means...it's not a no.

26:32.859 --> 26:35.527
It's gonna take a little bit
more time, that's all.

26:35.594 --> 26:37.029
Got a cigarette?

26:37.096 --> 26:39.265
- How about a little heat here?
- You're getting it.

26:39.331 --> 26:42.902
If I put it on full blast,
the car will blow up.

26:42.969 --> 26:45.772
Just shoot this car
and put it out of its misery.

26:45.838 --> 26:48.007
- My last one.
- 'Thanks.'

26:48.074 --> 26:51.043
You ought to cut down anyway.
These things'll kill ya.

26:51.110 --> 26:54.647
Love the way you're always
looking out for our welfare.

26:55.481 --> 26:57.616
Oh, by the way, Molly..

26:58.550 --> 27:00.653
...I got somethin' for you.

27:03.555 --> 27:05.725
Okay, thanks a lot, Harry.

27:05.792 --> 27:08.127
But I don't like doin' it.

27:08.194 --> 27:11.497
You really ought to start
cuttin' down on those things.

27:11.563 --> 27:13.933
If something happened to you,
this other one here

27:14.000 --> 27:16.368
she'd be left to herself,
will be all by herself.

27:16.435 --> 27:19.338
He's right, Molly.
After all, we're a tag team.

27:20.439 --> 27:22.008
'Harry!'

27:22.074 --> 27:24.243
'Didn't you see a car
do the hustle before?'

27:24.310 --> 27:26.679
'And you wonder
why I take pills?'

27:28.114 --> 27:30.917
You know, I had a thought,
an idea for you girls

27:30.983 --> 27:33.652
it's not fully realized,
but it could be sensational.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.454
We are not getting
tattooed, Harry.

27:35.521 --> 27:38.090
No, I'm cold on that.
I got a better one.

27:38.157 --> 27:40.693
- Ya dye your hair.
- So what else is new?

27:40.760 --> 27:45.698
Not just the hair on your head,
I'm talking about your eyebrows.

27:45.765 --> 27:48.134
When you raise your arm,
you know under there.

27:48.200 --> 27:51.971
The fuzz over here. And it
doesn't have to be vulgar.

27:52.038 --> 27:53.639
I'm talking about pretty colors.

27:53.706 --> 27:56.876
There's nothing more beautiful
than frost-colored hair

27:56.943 --> 27:58.945
or a lovely silvery blonde color

27:59.011 --> 28:01.781
that picks up the light
when you go into the ring.

28:01.848 --> 28:03.315
That stinks.

28:03.382 --> 28:05.952
You're wrong,
it fits in with today.

28:06.018 --> 28:08.788
Did you know that in Paris,
the high fashion models..

28:08.855 --> 28:10.723
'I'll show you pictures,
Woman's Wear Daily.'

28:10.790 --> 28:14.026
We decided we wanted
to be the one tag team

28:14.093 --> 28:16.796
without a gimmick. Remember?

28:16.863 --> 28:20.466
Yeah but not your legs.
You shave your legs.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.134
It's a stupid idea.

28:22.201 --> 28:24.570
Thought this up yourself
or did you have help?

28:24.636 --> 28:26.338
What's wrong with it?

28:26.405 --> 28:29.575
We'll look like clowns,
that's what's wrong with it.

28:29.641 --> 28:31.177
The idea stinks.

28:31.243 --> 28:33.612
Alright, have it
your way, doll.

28:33.679 --> 28:37.083
Remember, you only got so many
chances at the brass ring

28:37.149 --> 28:39.318
'and you better take
every one of 'em'

28:39.385 --> 28:42.388
'because when you run out
of turns, kid, that's it.'

28:42.454 --> 28:45.892
You got the picture?
Now move your ass, you're slow.

28:49.862 --> 28:52.031
Someday, you'll go
too far, Harry.

28:52.098 --> 28:54.333
And I hope
you stay there.

28:56.702 --> 28:58.470
Miserable bastard.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.334
I think we hurt
Harry's feelings again.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.469
Oh, yeah?
How can you tell?

29:30.536 --> 29:34.373
Ah, you're in rare form
today, ladies. Rare form.

29:36.708 --> 29:40.012
Remember, anytime you don't like
the way I'm handling things

29:40.079 --> 29:44.783
just say the word
and the job is yours.

29:44.851 --> 29:47.653
'We never said you
weren't a good manager, Harry.'

29:47.719 --> 29:50.089
Just a lousy human being.

29:50.156 --> 29:52.191
That's what I like
about you, Molly.

29:52.258 --> 29:55.294
You got a real sense
of humor.

29:55.361 --> 29:58.030
You just bring out
the best in me, Harry.

30:06.005 --> 30:08.340
I must have done
25 miles today.

30:10.242 --> 30:14.013
Shut your face. You too.
Put that down.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.849
Alright, we got a chance.

30:16.916 --> 30:19.318
We got a real honest
to God chance.

30:20.953 --> 30:23.522
But if you two cows
wanna bust your butt

30:23.589 --> 30:24.857
making pocket change

30:24.924 --> 30:26.959
that's your business,
count me out.

30:27.026 --> 30:29.261
Look at me. Turn around.

30:31.063 --> 30:33.299
All I know is if you
wanna get somewhere

30:33.365 --> 30:36.936
maybe make some important money,
you got to lay off being

30:37.003 --> 30:40.539
such smart asses
and listen to what I got to say.

30:41.640 --> 30:43.209
Don't answer.

30:45.744 --> 30:47.179
You too.

31:13.439 --> 31:17.809
- Harry, lunch is on us.
- Okay, Harry?

31:17.876 --> 31:21.013
- Get in the car.
- Come on. We're buying.

31:23.282 --> 31:25.651
Well, they better serve steaks.

31:28.054 --> 31:29.956
Yeah, with real tablecloths.

31:30.022 --> 31:33.259
'Oh boy, we've got to
bear down tonight.'

31:33.325 --> 31:35.161
'I'm telling you girls,
listen to me.'

31:35.227 --> 31:37.396
'Can't coast tonight, kids.'

31:37.463 --> 31:39.631
'This can be
a very important fight.'

31:39.698 --> 31:42.368
'Toledo Tigers. You're not
fighting two shleppers.'

31:42.434 --> 31:44.570
'They didn't become champs
by accident.'

31:44.636 --> 31:47.606
'I'm telling you these
are two big strong girls.'

31:47.673 --> 31:50.442
'Because they're champs, there's
gonna be a lot of exposure'

31:50.509 --> 31:53.412
'gonna be a lot
of booking agents there.'

31:53.479 --> 31:56.448
- 'So, bear down.'
- 'Don't get so worked up.'

31:56.515 --> 31:58.484
'This is a non-title fight,
remember?'

31:58.550 --> 32:00.519
'Do we ever get any other kind?'

32:00.586 --> 32:03.489
'Trust me, girls.
This is a big step up.'

32:03.555 --> 32:07.193
'Maybe, this'll be a good
time to try the sunset flip.'

32:07.259 --> 32:10.196
'Do you know who
Big John Stanley is?'

32:10.262 --> 32:12.798
'Who the hell cares who he is.'

32:12.864 --> 32:15.567
'Aw, sweetie,
if you're in this racket'

32:15.634 --> 32:19.138
'you must know who
Big John Stanley is. '

32:19.205 --> 32:21.140
'Now 30 years ago, this man was'

32:21.207 --> 32:23.609
'the light heavyweight champion
of the world.'

32:23.675 --> 32:25.944
'He also helped coach
the United States team'

32:26.012 --> 32:27.913
'at the Rome Olympics.'

32:27.980 --> 32:29.881
'Now since then,
he's become a manager.'

32:29.948 --> 32:31.583
'No matter who he handled'

32:31.650 --> 32:34.286
'I don't care if it's
a man, woman, or midget'

32:34.353 --> 32:36.722
'they were always the best.'

32:36.788 --> 32:39.725
'This man stands
for the creme de la creme'

32:39.791 --> 32:41.727
'of the wrestling world.'

32:57.943 --> 32:59.911
Harry, the damn machine
took all my money

32:59.978 --> 33:01.647
and won't give me the cigarette.

33:01.713 --> 33:04.283
Stand back, sweetie. You
can't be nice to these things.

33:04.350 --> 33:06.485
They only understand one thing.

33:09.155 --> 33:11.223
- Wow!
- Come on, girls.

33:11.290 --> 33:14.060
I don't have all day.

33:14.126 --> 33:15.961
'Check the coin return,
you never know.'

33:16.028 --> 33:17.896
Let's face this off, June.

33:17.963 --> 33:21.300
- Let it go.
- That's it. Come on.

33:24.002 --> 33:25.904
Can't you take it, doll?

33:25.971 --> 33:27.706
'She's down.'

33:27.773 --> 33:28.707
Here we go.

33:32.411 --> 33:34.646
That's it. Get up and pin her.

33:34.713 --> 33:36.248
Get up. Come on, get up.

33:36.315 --> 33:38.617
You're kicking.
That's not wrestling.

33:38.684 --> 33:41.187
Ref, get out of here.
Let her fight.

33:41.253 --> 33:44.623
Told you to watch
the kicking.

33:46.358 --> 33:49.195
- Back to your corner. Go back.
- Christ, she can't do that.

33:49.261 --> 33:50.662
- Hey ref--
- 'Leave him alone.'

33:50.729 --> 33:53.432
You can do a lot,
but you can't do that.

33:53.499 --> 33:56.468
- Hair.
- 'Don't let her, kid.'

33:56.535 --> 33:59.138
You want my honest opinion?
You're a horse's ass.

34:06.178 --> 34:09.348
- Hair.
- 'Finish this off, June.'

34:09.415 --> 34:13.185
- That way, Iris.
- Turn it around, Iris.

34:13.252 --> 34:15.987
You can turn this around, baby.

34:16.054 --> 34:18.556
- Hair, hair, hair.
- Hey.

34:24.730 --> 34:25.964
Get up.

34:26.031 --> 34:27.998
Yes, sir, that's my baby!

34:28.065 --> 34:31.203
No problem, sweetheart.
Stay loose.

34:32.304 --> 34:35.806
'Get up, June.
Give it a pin.'

34:35.873 --> 34:38.244
Come on, get up.
Get up there.

34:39.777 --> 34:41.847
Come on.

34:41.913 --> 34:44.616
Get off me,
you double crossing tanker.

34:44.683 --> 34:47.619
- 'One two.'
- Wait, stop.

34:49.688 --> 34:51.623
Better make the pin,
sweetheart.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.059
- One, two..
- Get up. Get up.

34:56.527 --> 34:59.365
'Beautiful, honey.
You got it! Yeah.'

35:12.578 --> 35:14.813
Boo.
Ah, boo.

35:16.348 --> 35:18.884
- A miracle!
- You did a good job.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.320
A miracle. California Dolls.

35:21.387 --> 35:24.456
'You're seeing the next
champions of the world.'

35:24.523 --> 35:27.125
- I'm number one here.
- Number one, huh.

35:39.705 --> 35:41.440
I just don't understand
what happened.

35:41.507 --> 35:43.309
What are you getting
so excited about?

35:43.375 --> 35:45.311
- It's just another match.
- But we lost.

35:45.377 --> 35:47.078
So you lost. Big deal.

35:47.145 --> 35:50.516
It's not the first time.
Certainly won't be the last.

35:50.582 --> 35:53.118
Besides, it wasn't
for the championship.

35:53.185 --> 35:54.786
But we were supposed to win.

35:54.853 --> 36:00.659
Oh, you weren't supposed to win.
Nobody is ever supposed to win.

36:02.294 --> 36:04.396
I did ask Harry

36:04.463 --> 36:07.098
if it were close and he
could see his way clear

36:07.165 --> 36:10.135
I would appreciate it
if he would speak to his girls

36:10.202 --> 36:12.271
about not trying so hard

36:12.338 --> 36:14.206
since this is
your home territory.

36:14.273 --> 36:15.874
Yeah.

36:15.941 --> 36:17.409
'And we'd return the favor.'

36:17.476 --> 36:18.710
So?

36:18.777 --> 36:22.381
So, Harry would or would
not do what he had to do.

36:22.448 --> 36:24.716
I would have done
the same thing.

36:24.783 --> 36:27.386
And what do you think
you were doing out there?

36:27.453 --> 36:29.555
- Wrestling.
- You didn't let June pin you.

36:29.621 --> 36:31.557
Honey, I don't let
anybody pin me.

36:31.623 --> 36:34.192
You aren't good enough to
beat us, that's your problem.

36:34.260 --> 36:35.761
Say what?

36:35.827 --> 36:39.231
Those were our fans out there.
They came to see us win.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.400
Yeah, but when you lost

36:41.467 --> 36:43.369
they didn't sound too
brokenhearted to me.

36:43.435 --> 36:45.237
How'd you like
another kick in the butt?

36:45.304 --> 36:48.507
John, I think we better separate
these girls till they cool down.

36:48.574 --> 36:50.542
Don't tell me
to cool down, you pimp.

36:50.609 --> 36:52.544
Watch who you're
calling names, you cow.

36:52.611 --> 36:54.846
Alright, I hate to break
this duel of wits.

36:54.913 --> 36:57.683
Maybe you need that little baby
face of yours messed up.

36:57.749 --> 36:59.785
- Cool it, June.
- Mind your own business.

36:59.851 --> 37:01.753
These two smart asses
got something coming.

37:01.820 --> 37:03.955
Maybe you'd like
to start it, huh?

37:04.022 --> 37:05.991
You bet your ass.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.962
Are you crazy?
What am I..

37:17.436 --> 37:19.237
Oh, shit. Not again.

37:37.556 --> 37:39.057
Get the hell out of here.

37:39.124 --> 37:44.696
- I'll disqualify your girl.
- Choke. You call it.

37:44.763 --> 37:48.334
You call it.
You call it.

37:48.400 --> 37:50.035
Choke.

38:16.662 --> 38:18.830
Why are we doing all
the pushing

38:18.897 --> 38:20.732
when we are paying
all the bills.

38:20.799 --> 38:23.034
Road work.
It's good for you.

38:23.101 --> 38:25.971
I suppose, this is road work.

38:26.037 --> 38:27.573
You're using your legs.

38:27.639 --> 38:31.710
Yeah, what are you using?
Your ass?

38:31.777 --> 38:34.312
'What did Solly say
about Chicago?'

38:34.380 --> 38:36.448
- 'We're close.'
- 'Close. How close?'

38:36.515 --> 38:38.316
'We've been hearing
that for months.'

38:38.384 --> 38:41.587
'Very close. I'm right
on top of this'

38:41.653 --> 38:44.222
'and I know for a fact
that Solly is interested'

38:44.289 --> 38:45.891
'in the California Dolls.'

38:45.957 --> 38:47.926
You better not be
making this up, Harry.

38:47.993 --> 38:50.762
Why would I make it up?
Look at it this way.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.631
If Solly wasn't interested
in The Dolls

38:52.698 --> 38:54.900
we wouldn't have the date
in the first place.

38:54.966 --> 38:57.569
Now we're getting
a new price.

38:57.636 --> 39:00.205
- Five big ones.
- Alright.

39:00.271 --> 39:03.241
- Five big ones?
- Five big ones.

39:03.308 --> 39:05.477
You got a cigarette?
I want one.

39:05.544 --> 39:07.479
You don't change, do you?

39:07.546 --> 39:09.381
I ask the question.
If something's perfect

39:09.448 --> 39:10.916
why would you change it?

39:10.982 --> 39:14.986
Well, Mr. Perfect, we got
to stop because now I'm out.

39:15.053 --> 39:16.988
I wish you two
would stop smoking.

39:17.055 --> 39:19.658
'It's really bad
for your health.'

39:22.127 --> 39:23.729
'You think we got it tough?'

39:23.795 --> 39:25.564
'How'd you like
to work in there?'

39:25.631 --> 39:28.099
Alright, tell me, Earl,
what's the deal.

39:28.166 --> 39:32.303
Oh, well, you'll be fighting
the local champs.

39:32.370 --> 39:35.674
The creatures from
the Black Lagoon.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.709
I came up with that name
myself, ladies.

39:37.776 --> 39:39.478
- Oh.
- That is very catchy.

39:39.545 --> 39:41.580
Thank you.
It's all for a worthy cause.

39:41.647 --> 39:43.649
This year, we're gonna
add a rec room

39:43.715 --> 39:45.216
onto the American
Legion Hall.

39:45.283 --> 39:46.585
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

39:46.652 --> 39:48.620
You'll be surprised
how ping pong

39:48.687 --> 39:50.856
can add some fun
to an old soldier's life.

39:50.922 --> 39:52.691
- Oh I bet.
- Right this way.

39:52.758 --> 39:56.562
Come on ladies, this way.

39:56.628 --> 39:59.898
The Ladies Auxillary pitched in
and painted the benches.

39:59.965 --> 40:02.501
All I want know is,
where's the ring.

40:02.568 --> 40:04.235
Oh, no ring?

40:04.302 --> 40:06.705
You're gonna wrestle
in that mud hole over there.

40:06.772 --> 40:08.707
- Mud hole?
- 'Oh, yeah.'

40:08.774 --> 40:11.577
'It's become an annual
highlight of the carnival.'

40:11.643 --> 40:14.913
'Ah, by the way, I do
a little joke every year.'

40:14.980 --> 40:17.382
I come out before
the bout, and I say

40:17.449 --> 40:21.086
"Now, girls, I want
a good, clean fight."

40:21.152 --> 40:23.489
'See, the fight's in mud.'

40:23.555 --> 40:25.991
That always gets a good
laugh from the crowd.

40:28.293 --> 40:30.261
I came up with
that line myself.

40:31.997 --> 40:35.000
Yeah, well you can do
something else by yourself.

40:35.066 --> 40:38.269
Think about it. Come on, Mol,
let's get the hell outta here.

40:38.336 --> 40:39.638
- Ah!
- Creep.

40:39.705 --> 40:41.673
- Did-did you see--
- Alright, just relax.

40:41.740 --> 40:43.575
I'm gonna take care
of everything.

40:43.642 --> 40:46.077
That's no way to talk
to a Lieutenant Governor

40:46.144 --> 40:47.579
of the Kiwanis Club.

40:47.646 --> 40:50.115
- Alright, relax girl.
- Where the hell have you been?

40:50.181 --> 40:52.851
Relax, come on, calm down. Hey!

40:52.918 --> 40:55.821
Calm down. It's a little mud,
it'll wash off.

40:55.887 --> 40:58.423
What about the embarrassment?
That doesn't wash off so easy.

40:58.490 --> 41:01.693
Do you think that I knew that
you're gonna fight in mud?

41:01.760 --> 41:03.428
- Yes.
- Seriously?

41:03.495 --> 41:05.163
This is a career move.

41:05.230 --> 41:07.132
Rolling in mud is a career move?

41:07.198 --> 41:11.436
Very important. Because it
establishes a new price for us.

41:11.503 --> 41:15.607
We can point to a contract. We
got it here in black and white.

41:15.674 --> 41:17.843
We're getting $500 a night.

41:17.909 --> 41:21.479
- For...get it.
- No one's gonna see you.

41:21.547 --> 41:23.915
And now really,
look at this dump.

41:23.982 --> 41:25.416
Who's here?

41:25.483 --> 41:28.887
Trust me, girls. It's not gonna
be on the Wide World of Sports.

41:28.954 --> 41:32.323
We're not going into the goddamn
mud pit, and that's it!

41:32.390 --> 41:34.593
I'm not turning myself
into a sideshow freak

41:34.660 --> 41:36.294
for you or anybody else.

41:36.361 --> 41:38.363
- No way.
- Hey!

41:38.429 --> 41:41.432
Every time you walk into
the ring, you're a freak.

41:41.499 --> 41:44.736
And that's what a wrestler is.

41:44.803 --> 41:47.372
You didn't sign up
to be the Queen of England

41:47.438 --> 41:49.741
so get off your high horse.

41:49.808 --> 41:52.611
'So you jump
in a little mud. Big deal!'

41:53.979 --> 41:56.682
'You're costing us five bills.'

41:56.748 --> 41:59.885
- 'Five! F-I-V-E.'
- We're not interested, Harry.

41:59.951 --> 42:03.054
Not today, not tomorrow,
not ever.

42:03.121 --> 42:04.790
E-V-E-R, ever.

42:08.694 --> 42:10.461
Ladies, you wanna pay..

42:10.528 --> 42:14.265
Ladies, you're not paying
attention. Only two in the ring.

42:14.332 --> 42:16.334
- You out.
- You in.

42:16.401 --> 42:18.970
Oh, my god, no.

42:21.406 --> 42:22.908
'Somebody help him.'

42:22.974 --> 42:25.376
I never knew you
were a party crasher.

42:25.443 --> 42:27.145
Merle.

42:30.348 --> 42:33.952
Merle, there is mud in your eye.
There is some mud in your eye.

42:34.019 --> 42:37.823
'I can't tell Merle from the
girls. Gosh, look at this man.'

42:37.889 --> 42:39.991
- Evelyn, honey, I'm sorry.
- Forget it, Merle.

42:40.058 --> 42:42.961
'Looks like he's gonna sleeping
on the couch tonight, I think.'

42:43.028 --> 42:46.164
'This is a business where you
got a plenty of hard knocks.'

42:46.231 --> 42:50.001
'As a matter of fact, here's a
couple of pretty good knockers.'

42:50.068 --> 42:52.871
'Ladies and gentlemen,
everything you're seeing here'

42:52.938 --> 42:55.173
'is absolutely real,
you don't think this is real'

42:55.240 --> 42:57.208
'take a look
under those T-shirts.'

42:57.275 --> 43:00.145
'Wait a minute, you're
gonna miss the best part.'

43:00.211 --> 43:02.380
'The best is yet to come.
Don't leave yet.'

43:02.447 --> 43:05.283
'And there they go.
My god, look at this.'

43:05.350 --> 43:10.055
'Ladies and gentlemen, you're
seeing it all right here.'

43:10.121 --> 43:12.624
- 'They're at it again.'
- Mr. and Mrs. Cobel.

43:12.691 --> 43:14.860
Oh, my god, we're
losing the seniors.

43:14.926 --> 43:17.696
'Lady, can I be
the mud in your life.'

43:17.763 --> 43:20.666
Oh, shit!

43:20.732 --> 43:23.635
You know what, I never
told you this, Merle.

43:23.702 --> 43:25.704
But you are an asshole.

43:27.405 --> 43:29.741
'Oh, man, look at them jugs!'

43:51.129 --> 43:53.965
'Roll all over again.'

43:54.032 --> 43:58.636
'That's it, yeah.'

43:58.704 --> 44:01.472
'Look at them boobies,
they're in the dirt.'

44:09.047 --> 44:13.551
'Car should be ready
at 7 o'clock.'

44:13.618 --> 44:17.689
'Thanks for the lift.'

44:17.756 --> 44:19.691
'Thanks again.'

44:23.729 --> 44:26.331
That lip is still bleeding.
Let me take a look.

44:26.397 --> 44:27.933
Don't touch me.

44:27.999 --> 44:30.201
You've already caused enough
trouble for one day.

44:30.268 --> 44:33.638
- I'm gonna clean up next door.
- Sure.

44:33.705 --> 44:35.974
Get the hell
outta my way!

44:41.046 --> 44:43.681
Goddammit! Open the door!
Get out here and open the door!

44:43.749 --> 44:46.351
'Iris, you got to do
something about that lip.'

44:46.417 --> 44:50.989
'Quit playing Dr. Kildare,
open the door, and let me in.'

44:51.056 --> 44:53.825
Iris, that thing is wide open.
Let me clean it up.

44:53.892 --> 44:57.328
Will you just leave me alone?
Okay, just leave me alone.

45:01.266 --> 45:04.936
I hate your guts, Harry.
I hate everything about you.

45:05.003 --> 45:06.805
I can't stand
the sight of you anymore.

45:06.872 --> 45:11.409
You're fired. Get the hell out.
Get the hell outta my life.

45:11.476 --> 45:14.379
You're a lousy lover,
you're a lousy manager.

45:14.445 --> 45:16.714
And you're a lousy human being.

45:16.782 --> 45:18.784
Now, that really hurts.

45:18.850 --> 45:22.053
I am not a lousy manager.

45:22.120 --> 45:24.923
This is all your fault, Harry.
None of this woulda happened

45:24.990 --> 45:26.724
if it wasn't for you.

45:26.792 --> 45:30.028
You did this to me. You
turned me into a freak today.

45:30.095 --> 45:33.064
They were laughing at me, Harry,
they were laughing at me.

45:33.131 --> 45:36.134
And it was all your fault.
You know what you are, Harry?

45:36.201 --> 45:39.104
You're a low life.
A lousy, stinking low life.

45:39.170 --> 45:41.439
Loser, loser, loser,
loser, loser.

45:43.174 --> 45:45.610
Ah.

45:53.819 --> 45:56.087
Alright, sweetie. Alright.

45:57.555 --> 46:01.459
Harry, they laughed at me.

46:01.526 --> 46:03.061
I..

46:05.130 --> 46:07.866
I can take anything
but them laughing at me.

46:07.933 --> 46:09.901
Why did you
let them laugh at me?

46:09.968 --> 46:12.037
They never laughed
at you, sweetheart.

46:12.103 --> 46:14.205
- Yes, they did.
- No.

46:14.272 --> 46:16.875
They're just trying
to have a good time.

46:16.942 --> 46:19.077
Here, let me get that.

46:39.865 --> 46:41.166
Why do you?

46:41.232 --> 46:43.935
Why do you
always have to hurt me?

46:44.002 --> 46:46.004
I don't know.

46:47.572 --> 46:49.807
No, I don't know.

46:49.875 --> 46:51.109
Well..

46:51.176 --> 46:53.244
There's blood,
all over your face.

46:53.311 --> 46:55.914
Yeah, don't make
any difference.

46:59.117 --> 47:01.286
Oh, hold me, Harry.

47:03.721 --> 47:06.791
I've needed you so long.

47:06.858 --> 47:10.495
I want you, Harry...now.

47:14.365 --> 47:16.968
'Says here that Superstar
and Big Mama are going'

47:17.035 --> 47:18.803
'to battle it out
for the world championship.'

47:18.870 --> 47:22.207
Wow, 25 grand to the winner
and 10 grand to the loser.

47:22.273 --> 47:25.076
- Not bad for a night's work.
- No kidding.

47:25.143 --> 47:27.112
I once saw
Big Mama in L.A.

47:27.178 --> 47:30.781
She's so big all she'd do is
sit on you, and it's all over.

47:30.848 --> 47:33.118
That Superstar
is no slouch either.

47:33.184 --> 47:36.854
- Should be a pretty good match.
- When's it gonna be?

47:36.922 --> 47:40.525
Oh, I don't know,
it doesn't say.

47:40.591 --> 47:43.962
Wait a minute, yes it does.
The Christmas show in Reno.

47:44.029 --> 47:46.631
Hey, there's a story
in here about us you guys.

47:46.697 --> 47:49.600
"One of the hottest tag teams
on the circuit today are

47:49.667 --> 47:53.371
"the gorgeous California Dolls,
who seem unbeatable

47:53.438 --> 47:55.806
"everywhere they appear
and are definitely

47:55.873 --> 47:58.309
the rising stars
of the wrestling world".

47:58.376 --> 48:01.379
They got the gorgeous part
right. What else does it say?

48:02.747 --> 48:04.882
Hey, It's got our pictures too!

48:04.950 --> 48:07.818
Look at this, take a look.
We're stars!

48:07.885 --> 48:09.754
- My picture in there?
- No.

48:09.820 --> 48:11.923
That's right. Harry.
We're stars.

48:11.990 --> 48:13.992
We look a lot
better than that.

48:14.059 --> 48:16.227
Well, It's an old picture.

48:16.294 --> 48:17.528
Yeah.

48:17.595 --> 48:18.863
They've even got us ranked.

48:18.930 --> 48:21.766
We're number three
tag team in the country.

48:21.832 --> 48:24.369
Who's number one?

48:24.435 --> 48:26.972
The champs, dummy,
the Toledo Tigers.

48:27.038 --> 48:29.407
Then it's the Amazon Queens.

48:29.474 --> 48:32.077
'This is it, we finally
made the big time.'

48:32.143 --> 48:34.345
- 'What about it, Harry?'
- 'What about what?'

48:34.412 --> 48:38.216
'Why do I have to do
all the thinking around here.'

48:38.283 --> 48:40.251
'This is the break,
we've been waiting for.'

48:40.318 --> 48:43.989
'Talk to Solly. If you can
get us on as the opening match'

48:44.055 --> 48:45.991
'in Reno, we'll have it made.'

48:46.057 --> 48:48.626
Think of all
the publicity.

48:48.693 --> 48:52.130
- Give me the magazine.
- Here's what we gotta do.

48:52.197 --> 48:54.499
One, I gotta call Solly.

48:54.565 --> 48:57.235
Two, I get Solly
to see the article

48:57.302 --> 48:59.437
the picture and the rankings.

49:01.372 --> 49:04.575
What we really need now is
some bucks for some publicity.

49:04.642 --> 49:06.777
'Unfortunately, in the words
of Toulouse-Lautrec'

49:06.844 --> 49:08.579
'"I'm a little short."'

49:08.646 --> 49:12.683
But, your suggestion is very
good. I'm not ignoring that.

49:12.750 --> 49:14.219
Thank you.

49:16.621 --> 49:18.723
Alright. There's a phone.
I'll call Solly.

49:18.789 --> 49:21.826
Don't forget to tell Solly,
about the magazine, page 87-88.

49:21.892 --> 49:24.795
Yeah, yeah. Don't worry.
Page 87-88.

49:24.862 --> 49:27.632
- We'll pick up a few things.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

49:35.273 --> 49:37.675
If it's on sale,
I need toothpaste.

49:37.742 --> 49:39.144
- Okay.
- Aquafresh.

49:39.210 --> 49:40.878
'Okay.'

49:40.945 --> 49:44.315
- But only if it's on sale!
- Alright, alright!

49:46.484 --> 49:48.886
Wow, a drive-through
super market.

49:48.953 --> 49:50.888
Fascinating business.

49:50.955 --> 49:52.690
Now this is really a great idea.

49:52.757 --> 49:56.094
Solly, Harry Sears.
Gee, I'm glad I got you, Solly.

49:56.161 --> 49:58.596
Listen, something came up.
Very important.

49:58.663 --> 50:01.632
- In this week's issue--
- Don't you every say hello?

50:01.699 --> 50:04.369
We'll say hello later.
First I wanna talk.

50:04.435 --> 50:07.372
Now hear me out on this, Solly.
Very important.

50:07.438 --> 50:09.507
- In this week's issue--
- I saw it.

50:09.574 --> 50:12.410
- I'm talking about the spread.
- I saw it.

50:12.477 --> 50:16.847
Oh, you saw it on the Dolls?
Page 87 and 88 with a picture.

50:16.914 --> 50:18.816
I saw it for God sake.

50:18.883 --> 50:21.252
Well, listen, Solly.
That's an old picture, you know.

50:21.319 --> 50:23.488
- They look even better now.
- 'I like the picture.'

50:23.554 --> 50:26.357
Yeah, I like it too.
It's a hell of a picture.

50:26.424 --> 50:28.759
Here is the thing, Solly.
Do yourself a favor.

50:28.826 --> 50:32.063
Hold all calls and give me
your undivided attention

50:32.130 --> 50:33.564
for two minutes.

50:33.631 --> 50:36.701
Wednesday night, standard rate.
Take it or leave it.

50:38.903 --> 50:42.207
- We'll take it.
- 'Main event.'

50:42.273 --> 50:44.209
Oh, listen, Solly,
on the billing there--

50:54.652 --> 50:56.621
Well?

50:56.687 --> 50:58.055
Oh, wasn't easy.

50:58.123 --> 51:00.658
Had to push
a lotta buttons.

51:03.261 --> 51:05.296
Oh, people like Solly,
they're murder

51:05.363 --> 51:08.199
you gotta wear 'em down.

51:08.266 --> 51:11.602
Well, what's that
supposed to mean?

51:11.669 --> 51:14.172
Chicago, Chicago..

51:17.542 --> 51:19.844
'Who are we up against
tomorrow night.'

51:19.910 --> 51:22.313
'Solly didn't say.
But it's the main event.'

51:22.380 --> 51:24.549
'So, whoever it is,
it's not gonna be easy.'

51:24.615 --> 51:27.552
'Look, who knows,
it might even be the Tigers.'

51:27.618 --> 51:30.355
'If it is, they're gonna
be out for your blood.'

51:30.421 --> 51:32.157
'Don't be fooled
by the last time.'

51:32.223 --> 51:35.260
'Those girls are brutal. And
for god sakes, listen to me.'

51:35.326 --> 51:37.562
'Keep practicing
those sunset flips.'

51:37.628 --> 51:40.865
'Harry, would you just
leave the wrestling to us.'

51:40.931 --> 51:43.168
'Let's stay at
a first class place?'

51:43.234 --> 51:44.869
- 'Something special.'
- 'That's a good idea.'

51:44.935 --> 51:46.937
'We'll stay at Al's
Motor Lodge in Skokie'

51:47.004 --> 51:49.607
- 'Every floor has ice machine.'
- 'Thanks a lot, Diamond Jim'

51:49.674 --> 51:52.877
'I hate to be the one to
remind you. Luxury costs money.'

51:52.943 --> 51:56.147
'I'm sick of staying at those
roach motels you keep finding.'

51:56.214 --> 51:58.015
- 'Yeah.'
- 'You girls are excited.'

51:58.082 --> 52:01.186
'You wanna go first class.
That's understandable.'

52:01.252 --> 52:03.421
'Just remember, those frills..'

52:03.488 --> 52:05.856
'...cost money.'

52:05.923 --> 52:08.326
'Harry, you always keep
playing that same number.'

52:08.393 --> 52:10.795
- 'Is that your favorite?'
- 'Yeah. What's he saying?

52:10.861 --> 52:12.263
'I mean, what's he singing?'

52:12.330 --> 52:13.764
'Well, you see
that's Pagliacci.'

52:13.831 --> 52:15.800
'He is kind a like
a strolling player.'

52:15.866 --> 52:18.769
'He goes from town to town
entertaining people.'

52:18.836 --> 52:21.339
- 'So?'
- 'So, sometimes it isn't easy.'

52:21.406 --> 52:24.542
- 'Sometimes he gets down.'
- 'And?'

52:24.609 --> 52:26.577
'And that's why he is like us.'

52:26.644 --> 52:29.814
'He gotta keep going.
Gotta keep trying.'

52:29.880 --> 52:33.184
'Gotta hang in there
even if his heart is breaking.'

52:33.251 --> 52:35.586
'Oh!'

52:46.497 --> 52:48.233
- You got her.
- 'Like hell.'

52:48.299 --> 52:50.568
You got her. Hey, it's over.

52:50.635 --> 52:54.071
'Now was that body, was that--'

52:54.138 --> 52:57.308
'Now put some pressure on it.
Put some pressure.'

53:03.814 --> 53:06.284
'Watch that choke
watch that choke.'

53:06.351 --> 53:08.586
'Watch that choke.'

53:10.154 --> 53:12.357
She tried to choke me.

53:12.423 --> 53:14.325
- Ah.
- 'Okay girl.'

53:15.826 --> 53:18.363
- What are you kicking her for?
- I'm not.

53:18.429 --> 53:21.466
Now, don't let her
do that to you. Come on, get up.

53:21.532 --> 53:26.003
No problem, baby. You got her.
You got her, honey. You got her.

53:26.070 --> 53:28.539
- Count.
- One, Two.

53:31.576 --> 53:35.313
Alright. Alright.
That's the way to do it.

53:35.380 --> 53:37.582
'Programs, programs.
One dollar.'

53:37.648 --> 53:40.918
'Get your programs here.'

53:40.985 --> 53:44.221
Anything goes, sweetheart.
Beautiful.

53:48.025 --> 53:50.661
'Programs, programs.
One dol--'

53:50.728 --> 53:52.263
'Common, Mol.'

53:52.330 --> 53:54.732
Take her out, June.
Take her out.

53:54.799 --> 53:57.702
This is the big leagues,
baby. Anything goes here.

53:57.768 --> 54:00.471
- 'You got it.'
- You gotta play rough.

54:00.538 --> 54:04.342
'Nice ropes, goddammit.'

54:04.409 --> 54:06.877
- 'I'll tell you one thing.
- Ropes.

54:06.944 --> 54:09.480
That's a ropes play.

54:09.547 --> 54:12.650
'That's for the last time.'

54:15.286 --> 54:16.687
Come on.

54:16.754 --> 54:18.956
'Hey, ref, this is bullshit.'

54:21.191 --> 54:24.194
'Alright, June. Let's finish
this off. Get her, baby.'

54:24.261 --> 54:26.196
- 'Stick it to her, June.'
- Yeah.

54:26.263 --> 54:28.833
- 'Watch that knee.'
- 'That's illegal, ref.'

54:28.899 --> 54:31.001
Watch that knee.
That's a choke! Choke!

54:31.068 --> 54:34.672
One, two, break that hold.
Break that hold.

54:34.739 --> 54:36.707
'Break that hold.'

54:38.976 --> 54:42.547
'Alright, don't, don't worry
don't press. Just don't press.'

54:42.613 --> 54:44.582
'You'll be alright.'

54:52.590 --> 54:54.792
'Watch that hair. Watch
that hair. Watch the--'

54:54.859 --> 54:56.761
'Break that hold.
One--'

54:56.827 --> 54:59.597
Alright, let's go home now.
Let's finish this up. Come on.

54:59.664 --> 55:02.299
- What did I do? Huh?
- Enough.

55:02.367 --> 55:05.002
For Christ sakes.
Put your course up.

55:05.069 --> 55:09.173
I'll be a son of a bitch.
Are you in this fight or not?

55:09.239 --> 55:11.275
I'll choke you, asshole.

55:11.342 --> 55:13.378
- Come on take her out.
- Ah.

55:14.845 --> 55:18.516
'C'mon, Diane, let's do it.'

55:18.583 --> 55:21.452
- 'She's choking.'
- I don't care.

55:23.754 --> 55:26.624
'Enough resisting, you asshole.
Break it up.'

55:26.691 --> 55:29.259
Hey, you need a cage.
You're such a stupid ass.

55:29.326 --> 55:31.662
Your blind as a bat.

55:42.339 --> 55:45.610
- One, two, three.
- Ah, count, two.

55:45.676 --> 55:47.545
It's alright, get her again.

55:47.612 --> 55:49.213
- Hey ref..
- Get back to the corner.

55:49.279 --> 55:51.916
...I'll take this cane
and shove it up your nose.

55:51.982 --> 55:55.085
- Ah, my hair, ref.
- 'Oh, no, no, no.'

55:57.622 --> 56:00.257
'Get back in there.
Get back to the corner.'

56:00.324 --> 56:04.729
- Ah, my hair.
- Hold it, one..

56:11.101 --> 56:13.571
One, two..

56:13.638 --> 56:16.774
There are too many
girls in the ring.

56:16.841 --> 56:18.409
'One--'

56:22.947 --> 56:25.616
'Come on, June. Come on.'

56:25.683 --> 56:28.118
'Watch her, Iris.'

56:41.832 --> 56:45.803
- 'She's on the rope, ref.'
- Call it off, you son of--

56:45.870 --> 56:48.706
'Hold. One, two--'

56:48.773 --> 56:53.711
- Ah, June, hit her.
- Stop that.

56:58.616 --> 57:01.619
- 'That's the way, June.'
- One, two..

57:01.686 --> 57:03.988
Ropes, ropes. Ropes, ropes.

57:06.924 --> 57:09.226
'Pop corn, over there.'

57:09.293 --> 57:11.061
She's on the rope.

57:11.128 --> 57:13.097
'Break it, ref
she's on the ropes.'

57:13.163 --> 57:15.933
Remember the last time, baby.

57:18.168 --> 57:20.738
- 'Don't give up..'
- One, two, three.

57:20.805 --> 57:22.272
Now we are even, sister.

57:24.809 --> 57:26.611
Alright.

57:31.281 --> 57:34.519
She broke the rule.
She broke the rule.

57:34.585 --> 57:36.654
Illegal move.

57:36.721 --> 57:39.389
Yeah! Yeah! Whoo!

57:39.456 --> 57:41.759
Illegal. Illegal.

57:43.027 --> 57:46.764
No, I count her--
No, I counted her out.

57:46.831 --> 57:50.635
- On the ropes. No.
- No, sir. No, I didn't see it.

57:50.701 --> 57:53.838
You're a palooka!
On here, on the ropes.

57:56.006 --> 57:58.609
Get away.
Get away from me.

57:58.676 --> 58:02.146
- 'No, no.'
- 'I'm gonna fine you.'

58:02.212 --> 58:05.750
'You animal! She was
on the God damn rope.'

58:08.152 --> 58:09.754
Damn. Damn.

58:09.820 --> 58:12.089
Yes.

58:12.156 --> 58:13.691
'I was on the ropes.'

58:14.992 --> 58:17.194
- We were robbed.
- No, we weren't.

58:17.261 --> 58:19.463
We just weren't tough enough.

58:19.530 --> 58:21.566
You look okay to me.
Just a nose bleed.

58:21.632 --> 58:24.001
- Take a couple of aspirin.
- Alright, wait outside, Doc.

58:24.068 --> 58:27.805
- I'll see you in a minute.
- Harry, I'll be around.

58:34.078 --> 58:36.681
- You shoulda played dirty.
- Why don't you shut up.

58:36.747 --> 58:38.716
No, for once I think
Harry is right.

58:38.783 --> 58:41.852
I told you both before. But,
you don't wanna listen to me.

58:41.919 --> 58:44.889
If you wrestle for
Big John Stanley.

58:44.955 --> 58:47.124
You have to be pretty
darn good, number one.

58:47.191 --> 58:50.327
Number two, you need
a better coach than anybody.

58:50.394 --> 58:53.197
Well, then maybe we should
get Big John to manage us.

58:53.263 --> 58:55.566
No such luck, ladies.
He only handles blacks.

58:56.934 --> 58:58.636
'You girls decent?'

59:00.270 --> 59:02.873
'Like you to
meet a real nice guy.'

59:05.142 --> 59:07.544
Great, but in
the mean time, who's this?

59:07.612 --> 59:09.379
This is my friend, Eddie Cisco.

59:09.446 --> 59:11.248
Hey-y-y.

59:11.315 --> 59:16.220
Move over. Slide over.
I been working all night.

59:16.286 --> 59:20.925
Eddie, you know Harry Sears.
This is Iris and Molly.

59:20.991 --> 59:23.060
Eddie is a promoter
and a match maker.

59:23.127 --> 59:26.530
He also has a nice business on
the side, he rents towels.

59:26.597 --> 59:28.799
- Hiya, Sears.
- How ya doin', Eddie?

59:28.866 --> 59:30.968
What brought you all
the way from, Ohio?

59:31.035 --> 59:33.971
Not my Mercedes.
Seems I developed car trouble.

59:34.038 --> 59:36.807
Oh, that's too bad.
You oughta join the auto club.

59:36.874 --> 59:39.076
I see you brought
The, uh, Hulk with you.

59:39.143 --> 59:41.278
I saw your picture
in the post office.

59:41.345 --> 59:44.014
- Ya look even better in person.
- Thank you.

59:44.081 --> 59:47.284
Figured I drop back and take
a look at the Dolls up close.

59:47.351 --> 59:49.820
- May be get acquainted.
- Well listen, Eddie.

59:49.887 --> 59:53.090
Now that you had your look,
I suggest that you take a walk.

59:53.157 --> 59:55.359
The girls wanna
get cleaned up and dressed.

59:55.425 --> 59:58.095
Don't let me stop them.

59:58.162 --> 01:00:00.998
I guess, the Tigers gave you
a rough time out there.

01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:03.600
Well, we were out numbered.
Like three to two.

01:00:03.668 --> 01:00:07.571
- What makes you say that?
- The ref was on their side.

01:00:07.638 --> 01:00:09.807
This girl cracks me up.

01:00:09.874 --> 01:00:12.476
I'm going to be
around for a few days.

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:14.679
Maybe, you and I
can get together?

01:00:14.745 --> 01:00:16.714
Oh, now. I doubt that.

01:00:16.781 --> 01:00:19.817
See, I don't mix
business with pleasure.

01:00:19.884 --> 01:00:21.385
'Oh, by the way.'

01:00:21.451 --> 01:00:25.756
Eddie just closed the deal
to put the Reno match together.

01:00:26.957 --> 01:00:29.894
- The Reno match?
- 'Yeah.'

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:31.929
Congratulations, boss.

01:00:35.966 --> 01:00:40.037
- 'The Christmas show?'
- We'd be perfect for that.

01:00:40.104 --> 01:00:44.308
I'm still shopping. But, I don't
know if you girls are ready.

01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:48.445
- What's wrong with us?
- 'Ask Babe Ruth.'

01:00:48.512 --> 01:00:50.815
Nice to meet you, ladies.

01:00:50.881 --> 01:00:55.185
Ah...Harry, I hope
I run into you soon.

01:00:57.988 --> 01:01:00.124
Sears, see me before you go.

01:01:04.428 --> 01:01:08.398
Clever, Harry. You had to pick
his car for betting practice.

01:01:08.465 --> 01:01:11.468
I gotta hand it to you.
The Dolls are a good act.

01:01:11.535 --> 01:01:14.905
Harry said you bought
the Toledo Tigers to open Reno.

01:01:14.972 --> 01:01:17.241
Yeah. They're the champ.

01:01:19.043 --> 01:01:21.245
You decided
on the other team yet?

01:01:23.413 --> 01:01:27.051
How about...Thunder Thighs
and the Madame.

01:01:27.117 --> 01:01:28.886
Ha ha.

01:01:28.953 --> 01:01:31.155
Have you seen
Thunder Thighs lately?

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:33.590
The Thunder's been
replaced by Cellulite.

01:01:33.657 --> 01:01:35.793
Who do you
think I should buy?

01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:38.428
There's nobody as good as
the Dolls, and you know it.

01:01:38.495 --> 01:01:41.465
Okay, so we looked pretty bad
up there the other night.

01:01:41.531 --> 01:01:44.301
But we'll be ready
the next time.

01:01:44.368 --> 01:01:46.670
You could build
it as a grudge match.

01:01:46.737 --> 01:01:50.240
From what I've heard that's
not too far from the truth.

01:01:50.307 --> 01:01:53.343
It'd be terrific.
You know you'd get a good show.

01:01:53.410 --> 01:01:55.980
Let me think about it.

01:01:57.848 --> 01:01:59.716
Why..

01:01:59.784 --> 01:02:03.921
...why don't you
take me dancin'?

01:02:09.093 --> 01:02:10.594
Aah.

01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:21.371
I told you, Harry.
I don't know where she went.

01:02:21.438 --> 01:02:24.241
Did she say who she might
be going out with?

01:02:24.308 --> 01:02:26.243
I told you. No.

01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:32.549
Oh, look at this.
Cinderella.

01:02:32.616 --> 01:02:34.618
Gosh, does she look grand.

01:02:34.684 --> 01:02:38.488
She finally came home. Must
have been a hell of a movie.

01:02:38.555 --> 01:02:42.192
- Did you have a good time?
- Just great, Harry. Just great.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:45.529
- What've you been working on?
- I thought we'd move west.

01:02:45.595 --> 01:02:48.032
That's good 'cause that's
the direction we're heading.

01:02:51.035 --> 01:02:53.270
It's California Dolls
against the Toledo Tigers

01:02:53.337 --> 01:02:55.539
for the championship.

01:02:55.605 --> 01:02:57.942
Ten thousand. Winner take all.

01:02:58.008 --> 01:03:00.244
You were with
Eddie Cisco last night?

01:03:00.310 --> 01:03:02.579
So what if I was?

01:03:07.451 --> 01:03:10.988
Don't you ever
touch me again, Harry.

01:03:11.055 --> 01:03:13.223
Boy, you are just
full of surprises, Doll.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:15.059
I woulda let you
handle it, Harry

01:03:15.125 --> 01:03:17.361
but he doesn't go
both ways. I checked that.

01:03:17.427 --> 01:03:19.796
If you don't mind,
I'm gonna take a shower.

01:03:19.864 --> 01:03:22.232
So will you
clear out please.

01:03:31.375 --> 01:03:33.743
What are you looking
at me like that for?

01:03:33.810 --> 01:03:37.147
Why did you hit her?
She only did it for us.

01:03:37.214 --> 01:03:40.417
Did we ask her to?
I don't remember asking her to.

01:03:40.484 --> 01:03:44.788
Look, we needed something
and she got it for us.

01:03:44.855 --> 01:03:47.424
I guarantee you, doin' it
didn't come easy for her.

01:03:47.491 --> 01:03:50.895
Yeah. Well, hearing about it
didn't come easy for me.

01:03:50.961 --> 01:03:53.130
Can I tell her that?

01:03:53.197 --> 01:03:54.932
No.

01:04:07.311 --> 01:04:09.846
I'll have your
order in a minute, sir.

01:04:12.016 --> 01:04:14.284
- To Reno.
- To Reno.

01:04:18.956 --> 01:04:21.926
Now, to do this right.

01:04:21.992 --> 01:04:24.261
And we gotta
do it right.

01:04:24.328 --> 01:04:26.196
It's going to require
some real money.

01:04:26.263 --> 01:04:27.998
How much is real money, Harry?

01:04:28.065 --> 01:04:30.734
How much you got
stashed in that sock?

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.736
Almost 800.

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:35.372
Let me hold that
until tomorrow morning.

01:04:35.439 --> 01:04:37.474
- Come on, man.
- Alright, this is all going.

01:04:37.541 --> 01:04:40.044
- Okay, let it roll.
- I only live once.

01:04:40.110 --> 01:04:41.645
- Big seven.
- Six.

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:44.614
Aw.

01:04:44.681 --> 01:04:46.550
- Six.
- Hundred dollars.

01:04:46.616 --> 01:04:49.486
- Another six. Wow.
- Yeah, try and do it again.

01:04:49.553 --> 01:04:52.789
I'll buy the odds here.
Now, I can put 400 back here.

01:04:52.856 --> 01:04:56.093
Can I? Alright.
So I got 400 here.

01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.763
So I get...well you know
what I get on a back, don't you?

01:04:59.829 --> 01:05:01.765
- Yeah.
- With this, I get..

01:05:01.831 --> 01:05:05.435
- Okay.
- Hey, hey.

01:05:05.502 --> 01:05:08.072
Okay, here we go.

01:05:08.138 --> 01:05:09.739
- What a high.
- Six.

01:05:09.806 --> 01:05:12.276
Six. Another six.

01:05:14.078 --> 01:05:16.246
'Glad I followed
my horoscope.'

01:05:16.313 --> 01:05:19.716
Alright, I'm betting then.
I'm going to bet 600.

01:05:19.783 --> 01:05:22.019
- You got it.
- Six Hundred.

01:05:22.086 --> 01:05:24.221
- Let her lay, we'll play.
- Ooh! Alright.

01:05:24.288 --> 01:05:26.957
Okay. I got six stones.

01:05:27.024 --> 01:05:28.325
- Good shooter.
- Good shooter.

01:05:28.392 --> 01:05:30.995
- Doin' good?
- Do a seven.

01:05:34.798 --> 01:05:36.333
Six. Unbelievable.

01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.268
- Sixes are easy.
- I got my six.

01:05:38.335 --> 01:05:41.705
One, two, three
four, five, six.

01:05:41.771 --> 01:05:44.574
- How much do I get if I win?
- Thirty Three.

01:05:44.641 --> 01:05:45.809
- No, 25.
- Huh.

01:05:45.875 --> 01:05:48.612
Five. Five, no field.

01:05:48.678 --> 01:05:52.016
Five. Looking for a six.
Three is betted hard, boys.

01:05:52.082 --> 01:05:54.518
Oh. I'd love to make this.

01:05:54.584 --> 01:05:56.320
Come on, baby.

01:05:56.386 --> 01:05:59.223
'Six.'

01:05:59.289 --> 01:06:01.391
- Another six.
- 'Pay the man.'

01:06:01.458 --> 01:06:03.760
- Another six.
- Another six?

01:06:03.827 --> 01:06:05.229
Quite a few sixes.

01:06:05.295 --> 01:06:07.497
22, 23, 24
25, 20.

01:06:07.564 --> 01:06:10.567
'600 on the line,
600 hundred behind the line.'

01:06:10.634 --> 01:06:12.436
'Pays to you 25, 20.'

01:06:12.502 --> 01:06:16.040
'Alright, gentlemen
I'm gonna bet..'

01:06:16.106 --> 01:06:17.741
'...100 dollars.'

01:06:17.807 --> 01:06:20.410
Number of gold.
Bet it hard.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:22.079
Six.

01:06:24.214 --> 01:06:28.052
- Six.
- 'Come on give us a six.'

01:06:28.118 --> 01:06:30.820
- Six.
- 'Let's do this.'

01:06:30.887 --> 01:06:33.457
- Unbelievable.
- 'That's awful lot of sixes.'

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:36.393
- Alright.
- 'Lets go, here we go.'

01:06:36.460 --> 01:06:38.828
Lets see if we can
make another six here.

01:06:38.895 --> 01:06:42.132
- 'Yeah, lets see that.'
- 'Lucky man.'

01:06:44.401 --> 01:06:47.071
'I have never seen
anybody that lucky.'

01:06:47.137 --> 01:06:48.905
I think I'll call
it a night, gentlemen.

01:06:48.972 --> 01:06:51.741
- Call it a night?
- You did okay for a beginner.

01:06:51.808 --> 01:06:54.211
I guess I did that.

01:06:56.146 --> 01:06:58.282
Get those bets..

01:07:34.418 --> 01:07:36.286
I heard a noise over there.

01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:37.987
Maybe he's parked
around the corner.

01:07:38.054 --> 01:07:40.190
Bum, couldn't have
gone too far.

01:07:47.331 --> 01:07:50.100
Give me your money.
Give me your money.

01:07:51.201 --> 01:07:54.438
Give me your money.

01:07:55.739 --> 01:07:58.875
I think you broke my knee.
Get me a doctor.

01:07:58.942 --> 01:08:00.877
Give me your money.

01:08:00.944 --> 01:08:03.480
Give me your money.

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:05.582
You're not leavin', are ya?

01:08:05.649 --> 01:08:08.218
Yeah. But don't
bother to get up.

01:08:16.493 --> 01:08:19.062
'Last August, when you
put us in the tin foil'

01:08:19.129 --> 01:08:23.032
'made us the space amazons,
I felt like a jerk, Harry.'

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.868
'Sweetie, I tried something new,
it didn't work out.'

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:29.206
'A creative genius needs time to
discover the winning formula.'

01:08:29.273 --> 01:08:31.508
'Well Mr. Creative Genius.
You do understand'

01:08:31.575 --> 01:08:33.510
'there's only about
a 1000 dollars left'

01:08:33.577 --> 01:08:36.246
'after the tune up
and polishing the car.'

01:08:38.014 --> 01:08:41.518
We spent almost all what you
won at that crap game, Harry.

01:08:41.585 --> 01:08:44.587
I hope you know what you're
doing. That's a lot of money.

01:08:44.654 --> 01:08:46.523
Trust me, cookie.
I'm goin' on instinct.

01:08:46.590 --> 01:08:49.826
I once read that's how all
the lower life forms survive.

01:08:49.893 --> 01:08:52.729
When are you gonna admit
you're desperate for my body?

01:08:54.163 --> 01:08:57.767
You talk as though everything
about you is as big as your ego.

01:08:57.834 --> 01:08:59.603
Who said it wasn't.

01:08:59.669 --> 01:09:02.272
Secret's safe with me, Harry.

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:10.113
'Reno, the biggest
little city in world.'

01:09:10.180 --> 01:09:13.850
So, are you gonna use your funny
little dice here too, Harry?

01:09:13.917 --> 01:09:16.953
No, are you crazy?
Not in this town.

01:09:17.020 --> 01:09:20.023
You'll be laid to rest under
Liberace's parking space.

01:09:21.691 --> 01:09:25.127
Nothing worries Harry more than
threat of an honest crap game.

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:27.130
'Boy, Molly, the championship.'

01:09:27.197 --> 01:09:29.966
'God, it's scary.'

01:09:32.602 --> 01:09:36.005
'It's just like
our first time in the ring.'

01:09:36.072 --> 01:09:38.508
'Holy cow, Harry, look at that.'

01:09:38.575 --> 01:09:40.143
I told you, didn't I?

01:09:40.210 --> 01:09:43.212
Stick with me and I'll have
your name up in lights.

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.680
Wow.

01:09:44.747 --> 01:09:46.582
'Here's to looking at you, kid.'

01:09:46.649 --> 01:09:49.819
'Oh, Harry, it's the end
of the rainbow.'

01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:51.821
We finally made it.

01:09:53.357 --> 01:09:55.292
'Alright, Girls, this is it.'

01:09:55.359 --> 01:09:58.862
'We're fighting for the title.
We're fighting for our lives.'

01:09:58.928 --> 01:10:01.631
'Don't let anything interfere
with your concentration.'

01:10:01.698 --> 01:10:04.734
'And remember
those sunset flips.'

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.742
Oh, Molly, look at this.

01:10:17.447 --> 01:10:20.350
Look at this?
There's a parade here.

01:10:21.751 --> 01:10:23.687
Harry, where..
What did they do?

01:10:23.753 --> 01:10:25.822
- Hey, what happened?
- It's nothing.

01:10:25.889 --> 01:10:29.393
'This is not Al's Motor Lodge
in Skokie, you know.'

01:10:29.459 --> 01:10:31.495
But, there's ice machines here,
huh, Harry?

01:10:31.561 --> 01:10:33.530
That's right.
Talk about frills.

01:10:36.833 --> 01:10:39.536
They're winning.
What's wrong with us?

01:10:42.606 --> 01:10:45.409
- Been robbed!
- Let's go. We checked in.

01:10:45.475 --> 01:10:48.077
Leave us alone.
We're on a winning streak.

01:10:53.617 --> 01:10:56.620
Hey, woo, holy cow.

01:10:56.686 --> 01:10:58.455
Ha ha.

01:10:58.522 --> 01:10:59.989
We struck, Harry.

01:11:00.056 --> 01:11:03.293
Alright, now you got 'em stuck?
Let 'em stay stuck!

01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.161
Let's go.
Quit whining already.

01:11:05.228 --> 01:11:07.464
- Okay, Harry, please. come on.
- Wait.

01:11:07.531 --> 01:11:09.666
It's only nickels.

01:11:15.038 --> 01:11:18.241
Tighten' that up, fellas.
Really pull it.

01:11:18.308 --> 01:11:20.710
More tension.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:22.846
'More, more.'

01:11:22.912 --> 01:11:25.415
Oh. Well what do
you girls think?

01:11:25.482 --> 01:11:28.284
Would I stay until tonight?

01:11:28.352 --> 01:11:31.988
I think...I'll take a walk.

01:11:34.257 --> 01:11:36.626
Alright, thanks fellas.

01:11:39.262 --> 01:11:44.000
- What's eatin' your friend?
- Why don't you ask her.

01:11:44.067 --> 01:11:47.170
A lot of irate managers
on the telephone when..

01:11:47.236 --> 01:11:48.972
...they heard
the Dolls got this gig.

01:11:49.038 --> 01:11:52.809
That's their problem.
We earned the right to be here.

01:11:52.876 --> 01:11:56.012
Not what a lot of
other people think.

01:11:56.079 --> 01:11:59.816
Eddie, I don't give a damn
what other people think.

01:11:59.883 --> 01:12:03.920
And if anybody should ask,
you can tell them I said so.

01:12:03.987 --> 01:12:05.922
I like your style.

01:12:05.989 --> 01:12:08.792
I think we should get together
after this is over.

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:10.860
Just because we went
out once doesn't mean

01:12:10.927 --> 01:12:12.996
I'm interested in
making it a habit.

01:12:13.062 --> 01:12:16.099
- I thought we were friends.
- I guess, you thought wrong.

01:12:18.668 --> 01:12:20.570
- Bastard.
- Bitch.

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:24.007
Don't think
you've hurt my feelings.

01:12:24.073 --> 01:12:28.077
I've been called a lot worse
by a lot better people than you.

01:12:28.144 --> 01:12:30.547
Ow.

01:12:30.614 --> 01:12:34.751
- What's the problem?
- Nothing. It's all over.

01:12:34.818 --> 01:12:36.786
I don't want you talking
to my girls.

01:12:36.853 --> 01:12:39.423
You got somethin' to say,
you say it to me.

01:12:39.489 --> 01:12:41.357
Don't push your weight,
small change.

01:12:41.425 --> 01:12:45.028
If your girl wasn't so good in
the sack, you wouldn't be here.

01:12:45.094 --> 01:12:48.231
Stop it! Stop it!

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:51.535
Do you mind. Relax.

01:12:51.601 --> 01:12:54.771
Now look. Eddie, we all
know how we got here.

01:12:54.838 --> 01:12:57.607
You got what you wanted
and we got what we wanted.

01:12:57.674 --> 01:13:01.611
- So, now we're even, okay?
- We're even. Okay?

01:13:01.678 --> 01:13:05.114
- Harry. Let's get out of here.
- Right.

01:13:05.181 --> 01:13:08.652
I got a thousand that says your
girls can't beat the Tigers.

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:18.261
- All I got is 900.
- That's our last 900.

01:13:18.327 --> 01:13:21.097
- You want to bet or not.
- You don't got a thousand?

01:13:21.164 --> 01:13:23.733
I'll make it 900.
I'm a very charitable person.

01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:27.236
- Who do you wanna hold the bet?
- Harry.

01:13:27.303 --> 01:13:29.606
You hold yours,
I'll hold mine.

01:13:29.673 --> 01:13:32.075
Might as well,
it's not going any place.

01:13:32.141 --> 01:13:33.610
You gotta bet.

01:13:33.677 --> 01:13:36.379
It's a pleasure taking
your money, Sears.

01:13:36.446 --> 01:13:40.116
I don't know what a smart broad
like that sees in that jerk.

01:13:40.183 --> 01:13:43.419
- Harry, just forget it.
- See you around, Sears.

01:13:49.459 --> 01:13:52.061
Boss, I don't think
that was such a good bet.

01:13:52.128 --> 01:13:53.763
Shut up, Jerome.

01:13:53.830 --> 01:13:57.433
'Your attention please.
The MGM lion'

01:13:57.501 --> 01:14:02.839
'is presently available for
photographs in the shopping..'

01:14:02.906 --> 01:14:05.742
'Never seen lady
wrestling before.'

01:14:05.809 --> 01:14:07.977
'That man gave me
a free T-shirt.'

01:14:08.044 --> 01:14:11.114
'Would you, look at
that picture of Big Mama.'

01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:14.518
'Nah, I think it's a tag team.'

01:14:14.584 --> 01:14:17.086
'Yeah, like the American
Championship.'

01:14:19.489 --> 01:14:21.491
'Those girls are beautiful.'

01:14:21.558 --> 01:14:23.927
'I don't think
they're that pretty.'

01:14:23.993 --> 01:14:26.195
'I think you're jealous.'

01:14:26.262 --> 01:14:29.666
Quit givin' me a hard time
about these tickets. Come on.'

01:14:29.733 --> 01:14:31.367
- Cisco.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:14:31.434 --> 01:14:33.670
- Cisco.
- Hey, Eddie.

01:14:33.737 --> 01:14:36.506
Big Mama wants to see ya.

01:14:41.344 --> 01:14:44.514
What's the matter, your mother
drop you on ya head, huh?

01:14:46.015 --> 01:14:50.319
Well, explain it to me. What the
hell is goin' on around here?

01:14:50.386 --> 01:14:54.357
All I see since I've gotten
here is California Dolls.

01:14:54.423 --> 01:14:56.526
California Dolls T-shirts.

01:14:56.593 --> 01:14:58.394
California Dolls posters.

01:14:58.461 --> 01:15:00.697
I'm the star
of this show, Eddie.

01:15:00.764 --> 01:15:03.232
Yes, sweetheart,
you are, you are.

01:15:03.299 --> 01:15:06.502
You, how come you never thought
of selling a poster of me?

01:15:06.570 --> 01:15:08.404
I don't know,
I never thought of it.

01:15:08.471 --> 01:15:11.808
You should have. Lot of
guys like voluptuous women.

01:15:16.012 --> 01:15:20.383
Isn't that right? What do you
think of me in a wet T-shirt?

01:15:20.449 --> 01:15:22.385
I'm working on it.

01:15:22.451 --> 01:15:24.688
Keep workin'.

01:15:24.754 --> 01:15:27.591
'I have a telephone call for..'

01:15:30.927 --> 01:15:33.096
- Good luck, Harry.
- Yeah, thanks.

01:15:33.162 --> 01:15:35.899
Come on, come on, come on..

01:15:35.965 --> 01:15:37.967
'I have a telephone call for..'

01:15:38.034 --> 01:15:40.203
- Good luck, Harry.
- Yeah, right.

01:15:40.269 --> 01:15:42.305
'Merry Christmas.'

01:15:45.408 --> 01:15:47.543
Merry Christmas, George.

01:15:47.611 --> 01:15:51.681
'The MGM lion is presently
available for photographs..'

01:15:54.584 --> 01:15:57.186
Put those in the bin. Hurry!

01:16:04.894 --> 01:16:07.897
- Did somebody knock?
- 'It's Eddie Cisco.'

01:16:12.401 --> 01:16:14.671
You go on first.

01:16:14.738 --> 01:16:18.141
Alright, we'll be late. I want
my girls to make an entrance.

01:16:18.207 --> 01:16:20.243
Just don't make
an exit with the 900

01:16:20.309 --> 01:16:23.913
or else my friend might do to
you what someone did to my car.

01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:26.349
Eddie, I don't know
what you're talkin' about.

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.685
I kinda think you do.

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:32.889
I'll see you ladies ringside.

01:16:36.059 --> 01:16:37.994
Alright, girls.
Look, I've got some business.

01:16:38.061 --> 01:16:41.597
You two get dressed.
But keep this door locked.

01:16:52.508 --> 01:16:54.443
What's the matter, Mol?
You nervous?

01:16:54.510 --> 01:16:55.912
Who, me?

01:16:55.979 --> 01:16:58.347
Yeah, I never seen you
like this before a match.

01:16:58.414 --> 01:17:01.017
Yeah, well, tonight's
a little different.

01:17:01.084 --> 01:17:03.252
I'm working without a net.

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.189
What are you talking about?

01:17:06.255 --> 01:17:08.958
I've been cold turkey
for two whole days.

01:17:09.025 --> 01:17:10.960
Haven't you even noticed?

01:17:11.027 --> 01:17:13.663
My God, Molly, I've been
so excited about the match

01:17:13.730 --> 01:17:17.266
I never even noticed.
That's terrific.

01:17:17.333 --> 01:17:21.304
I thought I'd see if I needed
that junk for self-confidence.

01:17:21.370 --> 01:17:24.774
You can do it. I know you can.
You know what else?

01:17:24.841 --> 01:17:28.011
We're gonna win tonight.
I feel it.

01:17:28.077 --> 01:17:31.214
Well, let's hope
you're right, partner.

01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:33.216
'Cause this is it.

01:17:35.118 --> 01:17:39.655
Once again, number one,
back in...base.

01:17:39.723 --> 01:17:42.425
Number three...finished.

01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:52.135
'I have a telephone call
for Mr. Taylor.'

01:17:52.201 --> 01:17:54.838
'Mr. Michael Taylor, please.'

01:17:56.973 --> 01:18:01.110
'You are the champions,
and The California Dolls'

01:18:01.177 --> 01:18:05.348
'are greedy for your title,
hungry for your money'

01:18:05.414 --> 01:18:08.351
'and you whipped
their ass in Chicago'

01:18:08.417 --> 01:18:12.088
'so now, they're going to be
fighting for pride as well.'

01:18:12.155 --> 01:18:18.361
So, remember, pride,
hunger, greed

01:18:18.427 --> 01:18:20.563
ooh, they got it all.

01:18:20.629 --> 01:18:24.700
We want the Dolls!
We want the Dolls!

01:18:24.768 --> 01:18:27.436
Perfect. We don't
have to do that again.

01:18:27.503 --> 01:18:32.341
Alright, what's next?
Oh, very important.

01:18:32.408 --> 01:18:35.278
What's in it for you kids?

01:18:35.344 --> 01:18:37.446
Forty dollars a head.

01:18:38.581 --> 01:18:40.449
Fair enough?

01:18:40.516 --> 01:18:42.385
Alright. Now the song.

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:44.921
Very important,
here with the song.

01:18:44.988 --> 01:18:47.556
We want everybody
to sing this song.

01:18:47.623 --> 01:18:49.592
So look at your sheets, fellas.

01:18:49.658 --> 01:18:51.694
I am going to give you a signal.

01:18:51.761 --> 01:18:55.698
Hey, pay attention here.
You too.

01:18:55.765 --> 01:18:59.235
'Cause I'm going to give you
a signal. Here's the signal.

01:18:59.302 --> 01:19:02.071
When I go like this,
what does that mean?

01:19:02.138 --> 01:19:06.175
Hey...what does this mean?

01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:08.311
You don't know,
'cause I didn't tell you.

01:19:08.377 --> 01:19:12.181
Alright, when I go like
this here, you all gonna sing.

01:19:14.583 --> 01:19:15.618
Do it.

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:28.331
'Cigars, cigarettes,
cigars, cigarettes..'

01:19:44.513 --> 01:19:47.650
And now, live from Reno, Nevada.
We're very proud

01:19:47.716 --> 01:19:50.153
to be part of a
special sporting event tonight

01:19:50.219 --> 01:19:53.322
in conjunction with
Spectacular Sports Incorporated.

01:19:53.389 --> 01:19:55.358
'Hello again, everybody,
I'm Chick Hearn'

01:19:55.424 --> 01:19:58.394
'We're ringside of the
MGM Grand Hotel here in Reno'

01:19:58.461 --> 01:20:00.229
'and tonight,
KGIM has for you'

01:20:00.296 --> 01:20:03.566
'not one, but two
championship wrestling bouts.

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:07.136
'In our main event we're going
to have Big Mama defending'

01:20:07.203 --> 01:20:09.505
'her world women's heavy weight
wrestling championship'

01:20:09.572 --> 01:20:12.708
'and she'll be sorely tested
tonight by Superstar.'

01:20:12.775 --> 01:20:16.312
'In our semi-final tonight,
we're going to have'

01:20:16.379 --> 01:20:18.747
'The North American
Tag Team Championship.'

01:20:18.814 --> 01:20:21.817
'And that's gonna pit the
champions, the Toledo Tigers'

01:20:21.885 --> 01:20:23.819
'against the pride
of Southern California'

01:20:23.887 --> 01:20:25.354
'The California Dolls.'

01:20:25.421 --> 01:20:27.390
'And speaking of
the Dolls and the Tigers.'

01:20:27.456 --> 01:20:29.425
'They've wrestled twice before,
not for a title'

01:20:29.492 --> 01:20:31.460
'but twice before.
Each has won a match.'

01:20:31.527 --> 01:20:33.696
'That means this is
a grudge match, doesn't it?'

01:20:33.762 --> 01:20:37.166
Well, tonight ladies and
gentlemen it's safe to say

01:20:37.233 --> 01:20:40.069
that this match is
for all the marbles.

01:20:40.136 --> 01:20:42.238
'We're getting ready, Harry.'

01:20:42.305 --> 01:20:44.373
Let's go now to
the PA announcer.

01:20:44.440 --> 01:20:47.376
He's gonna introduce to you
a very nice man.

01:20:47.443 --> 01:20:49.778
'Ladies and gentlemen.'

01:20:49.845 --> 01:20:52.916
'The MGM Grand Hotel
in Reno, Nevada'

01:20:52.982 --> 01:20:55.084
'takes pride and great pleasure'

01:20:55.151 --> 01:20:59.055
'in introducing you to our guest
ring announcer for tonight'

01:20:59.122 --> 01:21:01.424
Okay, we are all set.

01:21:01.490 --> 01:21:04.560
Defensive captain of the four
time world champion

01:21:04.627 --> 01:21:08.898
'Pittsburgh Steelers
Mr. Joe Greene.'

01:21:08.965 --> 01:21:11.434
'Known to many
of his opponents..'

01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:15.504
'...as Mean Joe Greene.'

01:21:19.008 --> 01:21:22.912
Joe, the Boys' Club
thank you a lot.

01:21:34.390 --> 01:21:36.359
I think on or off
the football field

01:21:36.425 --> 01:21:38.794
he represents his sport
as well as any man

01:21:38.861 --> 01:21:40.629
in the history of football.

01:21:42.498 --> 01:21:45.301
Two arch rivals
of Tag Team wrestling

01:21:45.368 --> 01:21:47.536
will meet in a grudge match

01:21:47.603 --> 01:21:50.006
to decide which team is

01:21:50.073 --> 01:21:52.675
the North American Champions.

01:21:56.779 --> 01:21:59.515
'Under the rules of the Nevada
Athletic Commission'

01:21:59.582 --> 01:22:02.185
'there will be
a 30 minute time limit.'

01:22:02.251 --> 01:22:04.387
And in the event of a draw

01:22:04.453 --> 01:22:07.423
the Toledo Tigers
will retain their title.

01:22:11.394 --> 01:22:14.397
Prize. $10,000.

01:22:14.463 --> 01:22:15.898
Myron, the..

01:22:15.965 --> 01:22:17.967
Myron, I'm the star.
They're at $10,000.

01:22:18.034 --> 01:22:20.536
Listen, they gotta fill
up the card, you see.

01:22:20.603 --> 01:22:22.638
- They gotta fill--
- That's some filler.

01:22:22.705 --> 01:22:24.773
The referee for tonight's card..

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:26.142
...Bill Dudley.

01:22:30.479 --> 01:22:32.681
Fighting to retain
their North American title

01:22:32.748 --> 01:22:36.519
as the champion tag team
in a world of wrestling

01:22:36.585 --> 01:22:39.522
from Toledo, Ohio
the toughest

01:22:39.588 --> 01:22:41.524
the roughest pair
of street fighters

01:22:41.590 --> 01:22:44.827
in the business,
the Toledo Tigers.

01:22:54.403 --> 01:22:57.240
- We're number one.
- Yeah.

01:22:57.306 --> 01:22:59.242
'We're the Champs!'

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:01.644
'Let's hear it
for the Toledo Tigers!'

01:23:06.215 --> 01:23:07.950
They're out here in Reno,
Nevada tonight.

01:23:08.017 --> 01:23:10.586
And they wanna take back those
championship belts with them.

01:23:10.653 --> 01:23:13.122
- Will they do it?
- 'We're the Tigers.'

01:23:13.189 --> 01:23:15.558
Plus $10,000 to Big
John Stanley, their manager.

01:23:15.624 --> 01:23:16.859
Only time will tell.

01:23:16.925 --> 01:23:20.663
As they make their way,
they exude absolute confidence.

01:23:20.729 --> 01:23:23.632
'We're number one.
Yeah, yeah.'

01:23:23.699 --> 01:23:26.169
'Woo!'

01:23:26.235 --> 01:23:28.771
Haven't seen you
since Pittsburg.

01:23:28.837 --> 01:23:30.573
You're looking great today.

01:23:30.639 --> 01:23:33.276
Watch my girls, they're gonna
burn down this place tonight.

01:23:33.342 --> 01:23:36.379
- Yes, indeed.
- See ya.

01:23:42.151 --> 01:23:44.720
Do you like the Tigers?
Are we number one?

01:23:59.702 --> 01:24:03.972
The challengers from
Los Angeles, California.

01:24:04.039 --> 01:24:06.575
The hottest tag team
in the country.

01:24:06.642 --> 01:24:10.246
The best looking girls
in the ring today.

01:24:10.313 --> 01:24:12.448
The California Dolls.

01:24:26.629 --> 01:24:28.631
We want the Dolls.

01:24:28.697 --> 01:24:30.933
We want the Dolls.

01:24:30.999 --> 01:24:33.636
We want the Dolls.

01:24:33.702 --> 01:24:35.771
We want the Dolls.

01:24:35.838 --> 01:24:37.673
The California Dolls.

01:24:37.740 --> 01:24:39.808
We want the Dolls.

01:24:39.875 --> 01:24:41.810
We want the Dolls.

01:24:41.877 --> 01:24:43.912
We want the Dolls.

01:24:43.979 --> 01:24:46.349
We want the Dolls.

01:24:46.415 --> 01:24:48.851
We want the Dolls.

01:24:48.917 --> 01:24:50.886
Something odd going on here,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:24:50.953 --> 01:24:53.622
Joe Greene introduced the
California Dolls some time ago.

01:24:53.689 --> 01:24:56.459
Especially when you're on TV
when you get that introduction

01:24:56.525 --> 01:24:59.094
you're supposed to come down
and get into the ring.

01:24:59.162 --> 01:25:01.096
But they have not
made an appearance.

01:25:01.164 --> 01:25:03.199
Have not hit the ramp
into the ring.

01:25:03.266 --> 01:25:05.000
Oh come, Myron,
what's the delay?

01:25:05.067 --> 01:25:08.704
I haven't got all night
Get 'em on. Where are they?

01:25:08.771 --> 01:25:10.806
'Where could the Dolls be?'

01:25:10.873 --> 01:25:13.276
'Knowing Harry Sears, this
could be a deliberate delay'

01:25:13.342 --> 01:25:15.043
'trying to get the
champion's goat.'

01:25:15.110 --> 01:25:17.580
We want the Dolls.

01:25:17.646 --> 01:25:21.250
'I tell you this, if it's
staged, it's having an effect.'

01:25:21.317 --> 01:25:23.286
'A few minutes ago
the champions were kidding'

01:25:23.352 --> 01:25:25.120
'with the people
around ring side.'

01:25:25.188 --> 01:25:28.056
'Now, ladies and gentlemen
they're not kidding at all.'

01:25:28.123 --> 01:25:29.492
'They are mad.'

01:25:29.558 --> 01:25:31.327
- Where are the dolls?
- They're chicken.

01:25:31.394 --> 01:25:33.596
All I got to tell
you right now is

01:25:33.662 --> 01:25:35.598
I think the champions
have been upstaged.

01:25:35.664 --> 01:25:37.400
'They look pretty tough.'

01:25:37.466 --> 01:25:39.235
'And mean.'

01:25:39.302 --> 01:25:41.237
That's right, and mean.

01:25:41.304 --> 01:25:43.872
We want the Dolls.

01:25:43.939 --> 01:25:45.674

01:25:45.741 --> 01:25:48.344

01:28:54.497 --> 01:28:55.931
'you get a count of five.'

01:28:55.998 --> 01:28:58.601
'Outside the ring but on apron,
a count of ten.'

01:28:58.667 --> 01:29:01.303
'Outside on the floor,
a count of 20.'

01:29:01.370 --> 01:29:02.438
Is that understood?

01:29:02.505 --> 01:29:04.239
Now, managers..

01:29:04.306 --> 01:29:06.875
...let's get this shit off
of our girl's faces, alright?

01:29:06.942 --> 01:29:09.344
This a wrestling match,
it's not a vaudeville show.

01:29:09.412 --> 01:29:13.215
How do I see if they're cut with
all that crap on their faces?

01:29:13.281 --> 01:29:16.151
Let's go. You got 30 seconds.

01:29:19.422 --> 01:29:21.557
And this crowd really
getting behind it

01:29:21.624 --> 01:29:23.692
getting with it here
in Reno, Nevada, now.

01:29:23.759 --> 01:29:25.728
There's only one way
you gonna win, tonight.

01:29:25.794 --> 01:29:27.963
That's if you want it
more than they do.

01:29:28.030 --> 01:29:30.633
Just play it straight
and keep cool.

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:32.635
We're the better team.

01:29:32.701 --> 01:29:34.737
And remember,
you gotta beat 'em.

01:29:34.803 --> 01:29:36.939
If it's a draw,
they're still champs.

01:29:38.574 --> 01:29:42.210
Win or lose,
I love you both.

01:29:42.277 --> 01:29:44.847
But we come too far to lose.

01:29:46.148 --> 01:29:47.650
Go get 'em.

01:29:48.917 --> 01:29:51.420
- And whatever happens..
- It's gonna happen.

01:29:56.559 --> 01:29:58.927
Referee, Bill Dudley,
says wrestle.

01:30:08.103 --> 01:30:09.371
'Okay.'

01:30:09.438 --> 01:30:11.974
'No problem. Not the end
of the world.'

01:30:16.812 --> 01:30:19.482
Yeah.

01:30:23.385 --> 01:30:25.821
'That'll be a start.'

01:30:27.456 --> 01:30:29.625
'Oh-ho, what a beginning.'

01:30:34.362 --> 01:30:36.499
Beautiful, honey.

01:30:36.565 --> 01:30:39.167
Alright, shift.

01:30:39.234 --> 01:30:42.471
- 'Come on..'
- You were never better, honey.

01:30:45.841 --> 01:30:48.343
Get her, Molly,
get her.

01:30:48.410 --> 01:30:52.781
- Get back in there, Molly.
- Is this exciting?

01:30:52.848 --> 01:30:56.051
'I'd pay to see this,
and I'm cheap.'

01:30:59.588 --> 01:31:02.157
Get up, Diane.

01:31:02.224 --> 01:31:05.193
- Diane, get up.
- Let it all hang out.

01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:08.697
- Watch that choke, Doll..
- That's it.

01:31:08.764 --> 01:31:11.534
'Toledo Tigers. My ass.'

01:31:14.436 --> 01:31:17.239
Holy moly. What a move.

01:31:17.305 --> 01:31:19.675
Alright, now stop
grandstanding. Let's wrestle.

01:31:19.742 --> 01:31:21.744
- Watch that choke underneath.
- Don't choke.

01:31:21.810 --> 01:31:24.179
- Shut up.
- Ref, she's choking her.

01:31:24.246 --> 01:31:26.014
'How long you been dead?'

01:31:31.954 --> 01:31:34.723
Ah!

01:31:34.790 --> 01:31:38.527
One more time baby.

01:31:45.668 --> 01:31:47.603
Hey, they're both
in there!

01:31:49.838 --> 01:31:51.607
June and Diane,
both in there..

01:31:56.945 --> 01:31:59.514
Now, the Tigers are winning.
Now, they'll kill 'em.

01:31:59.582 --> 01:32:03.552
Get out, I say. Hey, Manager.
You gotta get one of these..

01:32:03.619 --> 01:32:06.121
One, two..

01:32:06.188 --> 01:32:09.257
Hey, this is bullshit. There's
too many girls in the ring.

01:32:09.324 --> 01:32:11.694
Girls, you know
better than that.

01:32:13.528 --> 01:32:15.631
They set up London bridge.

01:32:15.698 --> 01:32:16.999
- Ow.
- Ow.

01:32:17.065 --> 01:32:19.802
The London bridge
comes tumblin' down.

01:32:19.868 --> 01:32:21.403
Oh, God.

01:32:21.469 --> 01:32:24.506
What are you doing?
Making a circus out of this?

01:32:24.573 --> 01:32:27.542
'This is the greatest fight
in history.'

01:32:27.610 --> 01:32:29.311
Out.

01:32:32.147 --> 01:32:33.548
'Smart guy, huh?'

01:32:35.450 --> 01:32:38.186
'That's the way.
We'll show them.'

01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:41.156
Watch her hair, Tiger.

01:32:43.592 --> 01:32:45.961
Not the end of the world.
Don't rush.

01:32:54.569 --> 01:32:56.004
Where's your pompom?

01:32:56.071 --> 01:32:58.340
Get this man a pompom.
He's the promoter.'

01:32:58.406 --> 01:33:00.976
Let's stop grandstanding.
Let's wrestle.'

01:33:01.043 --> 01:33:03.979
How'd you like it
so far, Ed?

01:33:04.046 --> 01:33:06.014
'Hey, Eddie,
no pompoms?'

01:33:06.081 --> 01:33:08.684
'Push out of it, June.'

01:33:08.751 --> 01:33:11.419
'Choke hold, ref. Choke hold!'

01:33:11.486 --> 01:33:13.355
- That's a choke.
- No choke.

01:33:13.421 --> 01:33:15.090
'Look at this.'

01:33:15.157 --> 01:33:16.591
- Oh!
- 'Oh!'

01:33:16.659 --> 01:33:18.661
'Oh, take your breath away.'

01:33:18.727 --> 01:33:20.395
Oh. Hey, look at that.

01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:29.104
Take her out, honey.
You got her.

01:33:29.171 --> 01:33:31.406
'She got her now.'

01:33:31.473 --> 01:33:34.276
'She'll take her out, now.'

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:36.779
- 'Oh, shit.'
- 'Come on, Molly.'

01:33:36.845 --> 01:33:38.313
'Get up.'

01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:41.784
That hurt Molly. She hit
the deck very, very hard.

01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:45.053
- Ha-a-air.
- I'll call it, I'll call it.

01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:47.656
'Okay, send her home, baby,
send her home.'

01:33:47.723 --> 01:33:49.858
And lookie here.
Fasten your seatbelts.

01:33:49.925 --> 01:33:51.760
It's the airplane ride.

01:33:54.296 --> 01:33:59.201
Look for the landin' strip.
This is one hell of a fight.

01:33:59.267 --> 01:34:01.837
Molly rolls right into June
and reversed that airplane spin

01:34:01.904 --> 01:34:04.206
'into a possible pin.'

01:34:15.784 --> 01:34:18.153
'Roll out.'

01:34:18.220 --> 01:34:21.023
Hey, ref, Hey, Bill.

01:34:21.089 --> 01:34:23.291
'What's your name?
Bill or Phil?'

01:34:23.358 --> 01:34:25.861
'What's the difference?
How long ya been dead?'

01:34:25.928 --> 01:34:29.698
One, two, three.

01:34:36.604 --> 01:34:38.807
'Look out, June.'

01:34:38.874 --> 01:34:41.576
One, two..

01:34:41.643 --> 01:34:43.478
You're robbin' us.

01:34:46.782 --> 01:34:49.251
Everybody's so calm.

01:34:49.317 --> 01:34:52.620
What do you mean calm.
Get back in that corner.

01:34:52.687 --> 01:34:54.322
And referee Dudley's stuck.

01:34:54.389 --> 01:34:57.793
It looked like he had a chance
to go for the third cap.

01:34:57.860 --> 01:34:59.461
That's exactly
what Iris is hollerin'.

01:34:59.527 --> 01:35:00.662
Get off the ropes!

01:35:00.729 --> 01:35:03.098
Watch it, ref,
she's on the ropes!

01:35:03.165 --> 01:35:05.100
'Finish her off, Diane.'

01:35:05.167 --> 01:35:07.135
'Diane's using a double eye..'

01:35:07.202 --> 01:35:09.304
'She's gouging her eyes.'

01:35:09.371 --> 01:35:12.074
'That's it, Diane.
Don't stop now.'

01:35:12.140 --> 01:35:14.409
'Pin her, Diane.
Pin her.'

01:35:14.476 --> 01:35:17.780
Come on, are you mute?
Call it, you dog.

01:35:19.214 --> 01:35:21.183
- Get in the corner.
- 'Get her, Diane.'

01:35:24.052 --> 01:35:25.921
'Ha-a-air.'

01:35:26.654 --> 01:35:28.390
Call it.

01:35:28.456 --> 01:35:29.892
What's going on here?

01:35:34.029 --> 01:35:36.498
'Ref, she's stamping
on her hair.'

01:35:36.564 --> 01:35:38.700
Hey, call it,
would you?

01:35:38.767 --> 01:35:41.870
It's beginning to stink here.

01:35:41.937 --> 01:35:44.572
'Hey, ref, I know a fish
when I smell one.'

01:35:44.639 --> 01:35:46.374
Here's a great wrestling hold.

01:35:46.441 --> 01:35:48.877
Diane has Molly in a
figure four head scissors.

01:35:48.944 --> 01:35:51.513
That's ropes, God damnit.

01:35:55.150 --> 01:35:57.920
And the referee is more now
intent on arguing with Harry

01:35:57.986 --> 01:36:00.622
the manager of
the California Dolls

01:36:00.688 --> 01:36:04.092
and Iris over in the corner
than he is refereeing the match.

01:36:04.159 --> 01:36:06.128
Manager, get down.
Get down from there.

01:36:06.194 --> 01:36:08.330
Get down!
I don't give a damn!

01:36:08.396 --> 01:36:10.799
There's a lot of money
involved here.

01:36:13.201 --> 01:36:15.403
Sears is up screaming.
He's got a five down.

01:36:15.470 --> 01:36:18.440
He's got to get down those steps
or face disqualification.

01:36:21.143 --> 01:36:23.846
- Break it up.
- She's hanging on the rope.

01:36:27.149 --> 01:36:29.417
- Do your job.
- Get out.

01:36:29.484 --> 01:36:32.087
You bonehead! I'll tell you.
Don't come over here

01:36:32.154 --> 01:36:34.957
I'll take this bag.
I'll shove it right up your ass.

01:36:35.023 --> 01:36:37.826
- Choke! Choke!
- Not a choke. No, not a choke.

01:36:43.565 --> 01:36:44.900
Watch it.

01:36:44.967 --> 01:36:47.402
Go get her, baby.
Go get her.

01:36:49.604 --> 01:36:51.306
Careless.

01:36:51.373 --> 01:36:54.642
The crowd sees what you're
doing. It's not a secret.

01:36:54.709 --> 01:36:56.444
And so does your mother.

01:36:56.511 --> 01:36:59.347
Some of the fans have started
yelling for the dark suited

01:36:59.414 --> 01:37:01.649
Toledo Tigers, early in the
evening have now switched

01:37:01.716 --> 01:37:04.987
their allegiance over to the
white-clad California Dolls.

01:37:14.329 --> 01:37:17.065
Get over there.
Get in that corner.

01:37:20.335 --> 01:37:21.569
Go.

01:37:21.636 --> 01:37:24.439
The California Dolls
asserting themselves now.

01:37:30.078 --> 01:37:31.646
That a way, Molly.

01:37:31.713 --> 01:37:33.481
'Get up, June.
Roll out!'

01:37:34.549 --> 01:37:37.019
Count, you son of a bitch.

01:37:38.720 --> 01:37:41.156
He could've tapped them out
four or five times.

01:37:41.223 --> 01:37:43.926
Hey, you son of a bitch,
that's bullshit.

01:37:47.896 --> 01:37:49.831
'What's going on here?'

01:37:49.898 --> 01:37:51.934
We had the fight.
The fight was ours.

01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:54.769
Boy, that guy, Dudley.
I don't know about him.

01:37:54.836 --> 01:37:57.405
I'm getting suspicious myself,
but that's not for me

01:37:57.472 --> 01:37:58.773
I guess, to allege.

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:00.675
Just scared.

01:38:02.777 --> 01:38:06.714
- 'What's that ref up to?'
- I don't know what he's doing.

01:38:08.951 --> 01:38:12.454
Okay.
Oh, shit.

01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:14.656
You got to get up, Molly.

01:38:16.458 --> 01:38:18.793
Watch the fight, you monkey.

01:38:18.860 --> 01:38:21.896
'June hits Molly with a
punishing clothesline.'

01:38:21.964 --> 01:38:23.932
'Down she goes.'

01:38:27.435 --> 01:38:28.403
Ah!

01:38:30.638 --> 01:38:32.107
She's out.

01:38:32.174 --> 01:38:36.011
'Hair! Call it.
Call it, you monkey!'

01:38:36.078 --> 01:38:40.082
'Come on, June.
Finish her off.'

01:38:40.148 --> 01:38:42.951
You baldhead, the kid
is getting killed in there.

01:38:43.018 --> 01:38:44.719
- 'Her hair.'
- Hair! Call it.

01:38:44.786 --> 01:38:47.222
'Over here, baby.
Bring her to me!'

01:38:48.556 --> 01:38:51.226
What's going on?
You buy the referee?

01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:54.096
No way, baby, no.
Uh-uh.

01:38:54.162 --> 01:38:56.398
Smells bad to me, John.

01:38:58.967 --> 01:39:01.136
This fight is fixed.
No way to win.

01:39:01.203 --> 01:39:03.138
Just knock the referee
on his ass.

01:39:03.205 --> 01:39:05.140
Son of a bitch has..
Yeah, okay.

01:39:05.207 --> 01:39:07.775
Knock the shit out of the
referee. You'll get yours.

01:39:07.842 --> 01:39:09.877
- One, two..
- Don't forget.

01:39:14.916 --> 01:39:16.618
I'll tell you,
don't come here

01:39:16.684 --> 01:39:19.487
I'll take this bag.
I'll shove it up your ass.

01:39:19.554 --> 01:39:21.189
You alright?

01:39:27.029 --> 01:39:28.530
She stepped back.

01:39:28.596 --> 01:39:30.932
Iris missing that
second dropkick

01:39:30.999 --> 01:39:32.934
and down goes Iris
on her wallet.

01:39:42.810 --> 01:39:46.414
- 'Hey, John. Hey, John.'
- 'That's right. Finish her.'

01:39:49.151 --> 01:39:52.387
- 'John, is this on a level?'
- 'I don't even know the bum.'

01:39:52.454 --> 01:39:54.489
Hair hair hair,
you freak, hair.

01:39:57.592 --> 01:40:01.296
'Get back in that corner.
I say, get back in that corner.'

01:40:01.363 --> 01:40:05.500
Oh, they placed Iris up on there
like a cadaver on a slab.

01:40:06.734 --> 01:40:09.404
A two hand slam
to the midsection.

01:40:09.471 --> 01:40:12.907
You get a chance, you go hit
that referee flat on his ass.

01:40:12.974 --> 01:40:15.777
You're going to get yours, pimp.

01:40:15.843 --> 01:40:19.181
Get back in the corner.
Get back in the corner.

01:40:22.550 --> 01:40:25.120
Molly, fighting
back this time.

01:40:25.187 --> 01:40:27.322
She's a raging hellcat
over there.

01:40:31.559 --> 01:40:34.028
- Stay in the corner.
- Let me go in.

01:40:40.335 --> 01:40:42.204
'Let me in.'

01:40:42.270 --> 01:40:45.673
Iris, I think
is totally out now.

01:40:45.740 --> 01:40:47.842
'Break it up.
She can't breathe.'

01:40:47.909 --> 01:40:49.977
One, two..

01:40:50.044 --> 01:40:51.779
Can't you see
what's going on?

01:40:51.846 --> 01:40:55.250
Diane and June have Iris
in on a leg choke.

01:40:55.317 --> 01:40:57.385
Sometimes, this is called
the old rockin' horse

01:40:57.452 --> 01:40:59.954
and sometimes it's used
for submission.

01:41:02.390 --> 01:41:04.159
'You just can't breathe.'

01:41:04.226 --> 01:41:07.729
'Harry, make them stop!
I can't stand it.'

01:41:07.795 --> 01:41:11.633
Only 15 minutes left,
ladies and gentlemen. And Iris..

01:41:16.471 --> 01:41:18.973
That's the best
you looked all night.

01:41:19.040 --> 01:41:23.845
Watch that fight, you junkie.
Watch that fight.

01:41:28.783 --> 01:41:32.320
'Enough is enough, you asshole.
Break it up.'

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:35.557
Alright, tag up.

01:41:35.623 --> 01:41:38.926
'Hang in there, Iris,
hang in there.'

01:41:38.993 --> 01:41:42.330
Call it, you monkey.
Come on. Give me a break.

01:41:42.397 --> 01:41:44.566
'Would you gimme a call?'

01:41:48.136 --> 01:41:51.573
'This is a disgrace. This is
entirely a goddamn disgrace.'

01:41:55.109 --> 01:41:58.580
One, two..

01:42:00.382 --> 01:42:02.016
Come on, baby.

01:42:03.318 --> 01:42:05.453
They've got the referee pinned.

01:42:09.424 --> 01:42:12.126
They playing yankee doodle dandy
with his head.

01:42:22.103 --> 01:42:24.706
Get along, baby.

01:42:24.772 --> 01:42:26.908
Yeah. That's right.

01:42:28.943 --> 01:42:30.678
You want water? A pillow?

01:42:30.745 --> 01:42:32.680
How about another
shot in the ass?

01:42:32.747 --> 01:42:35.583
That's the answer, Iris.
Knock the shit out of him.

01:42:35.650 --> 01:42:37.319
'Diane..'

01:42:55.203 --> 01:42:57.038
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's chaotic.

01:43:01.476 --> 01:43:03.678
Oh, at the keister bout.

01:43:03.745 --> 01:43:04.746
Oh-h.

01:43:06.113 --> 01:43:07.682
Stay on the ropes.

01:43:09.150 --> 01:43:10.352
Watch those ropes.

01:43:10.418 --> 01:43:12.420
Damn right,
you son of a bitch..

01:43:12.487 --> 01:43:14.656
Forget the rope.
Get out of there.

01:43:14.722 --> 01:43:16.658
California Dolls.

01:43:16.724 --> 01:43:18.660
'Let's hear it
for The Dolls.'

01:43:18.726 --> 01:43:22.163
- Don't double dribble her.
- We're back in the fight.

01:43:22.230 --> 01:43:25.099
I would say 75%
of this throng now

01:43:25.166 --> 01:43:27.702
is for the white-suited
California Dolls.

01:43:27.769 --> 01:43:30.438
No, don't do it again.
Please don't.

01:43:35.277 --> 01:43:37.211
Don't do it.

01:43:39.247 --> 01:43:40.748
'Take her out'

01:43:43.017 --> 01:43:44.886
Come on, tag up.
Tag.

01:43:46.454 --> 01:43:48.456
You blind son of a bitch.

01:43:48.523 --> 01:43:50.525
Go get her, Iris.

01:43:52.527 --> 01:43:56.097
Tag up. You wanted it hot.
You want..

01:43:56.163 --> 01:43:58.800
You wanted a brawl? Alright.

01:44:03.237 --> 01:44:05.273
Get out of there. Ow!

01:44:06.708 --> 01:44:09.143
The Dolls appear to have taken
things in their hands.

01:44:09.210 --> 01:44:12.880
They're lambasting referee
Bill Dudley every chance.

01:44:12.947 --> 01:44:14.549
What the..
Oh!

01:44:14.616 --> 01:44:17.218
- 'What are you doing?'
- You wanted a brawl? Fine.

01:44:17.285 --> 01:44:20.322
'Get your hands off
my wrestler.'

01:44:21.222 --> 01:44:22.757
You want a..

01:44:22.824 --> 01:44:26.494
You want a brawl.
We'll turn it into a massacre!

01:44:26.561 --> 01:44:30.365
Anybody with
a weak heart, leave.

01:44:32.367 --> 01:44:35.136
Watch that elbow.

01:44:35.202 --> 01:44:38.640
Out of the ring.
Get out of the ring.

01:44:40.241 --> 01:44:41.776
The crowd is going berserk.

01:44:41.843 --> 01:44:43.711
'The California Dolls have
picked up followers'

01:44:43.778 --> 01:44:45.713
'from the minute
this fight started.'

01:44:50.452 --> 01:44:53.054
Stay away from 'em.
We got time on our side.

01:44:55.523 --> 01:44:58.326
Let go of me, ref.
Let go of me.

01:45:00.728 --> 01:45:01.696
Ow!

01:45:03.431 --> 01:45:05.667
Time running out.
We tie, we lose.

01:45:05.733 --> 01:45:07.935
Ref, she's got my hair.

01:45:09.003 --> 01:45:10.938
Goddamn suckers.

01:45:11.005 --> 01:45:14.409
One, two, three..

01:45:16.243 --> 01:45:19.046
Do it again. Hit 'em!
That's it!

01:45:25.987 --> 01:45:28.356
Under 2 minutes to go
in this championship bout.

01:45:28.423 --> 01:45:30.558
It's at a fever pitch!

01:45:35.397 --> 01:45:38.232
- 'Interference here.'
- Iris!

01:45:38.299 --> 01:45:39.534
Fourteen.

01:45:45.272 --> 01:45:46.774
A startling development.

01:45:46.841 --> 01:45:50.211
All four wrestlers are outside
the ring, failing away.

01:45:50.277 --> 01:45:52.747
Ouch. June, just
slam-dunked Iris

01:45:52.814 --> 01:45:55.249
and Iris comes up bloody.

01:45:59.887 --> 01:46:01.623
Three, two..

01:46:01.689 --> 01:46:04.692
You're hopeless,
you son of a bitch.

01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:07.829
...11, 12..

01:46:11.098 --> 01:46:15.837
- One..
- Not anymore! Not anymore!

01:46:16.904 --> 01:46:18.372
'...three'

01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:20.207
'four'

01:46:20.274 --> 01:46:21.509
Alright.

01:46:23.344 --> 01:46:24.612
We got 'em.

01:46:25.379 --> 01:46:27.048
Seven.

01:46:27.114 --> 01:46:30.752
We can still win this thing.
Got over a minute.

01:46:32.854 --> 01:46:36.824
'Get 'em again.
Take 'em out.'

01:46:38.192 --> 01:46:40.428
And The Dolls are catapulted
off the apron

01:46:40.495 --> 01:46:42.464
by a double shoulder butt.

01:46:43.531 --> 01:46:45.633
- 'One, two..'
- Yeah.

01:46:45.700 --> 01:46:47.835
Less than a minute to go.

01:46:47.902 --> 01:46:48.903
'...four..'

01:46:48.970 --> 01:46:50.572
'Iris..'

01:46:50.638 --> 01:46:53.240
'Oh, God, she's bleeding.'

01:46:53.307 --> 01:46:56.511
'They fought against
sunset flips.'

01:47:01.315 --> 01:47:04.686
Oh-h! A double sunset flip.
I don't believe it.

01:47:04.752 --> 01:47:06.854
'Count, you son of a bitch.'

01:47:06.921 --> 01:47:09.524
- Either one or both?
- I don't give a shit. Count.

01:47:09.591 --> 01:47:11.726
The referee doesn't
know what to do.

01:47:11.793 --> 01:47:16.464
Kids, count!
One, two, three..

01:47:16.531 --> 01:47:19.433
One, two, three.

01:47:19.501 --> 01:47:21.936
'One, two, three.'

01:47:22.003 --> 01:47:24.405
'One, two, three.'

01:47:24.472 --> 01:47:26.508
'One, two, three.'

01:47:26.574 --> 01:47:28.610
'One, two, three.'

01:47:28.676 --> 01:47:31.445
'One, two, three.'

01:47:31.513 --> 01:47:33.948
'One, two, three.'

01:47:34.015 --> 01:47:35.550
'One, two, three.'

01:47:53.501 --> 01:47:55.637
Total happiness
in Reno, Nevada.

01:47:55.703 --> 01:47:58.439
You can't get away with this.
I'm gonna protest.

01:47:58.506 --> 01:48:00.642
Ha ha ha.

01:48:10.718 --> 01:48:12.654
There were too many
people in that--

01:48:12.720 --> 01:48:15.957
'I know. There's nothing
we can do about it.'

01:48:17.224 --> 01:48:19.226
They looked pretty good.

01:48:24.866 --> 01:48:26.834
Coach, you alright?

01:48:30.004 --> 01:48:32.907
Alright, you were the champions
three minutes ago

01:48:32.974 --> 01:48:35.409
and you gonna be the champions
three months from now.

01:48:35.476 --> 01:48:38.479
Now, behave like it. Go over
there and congratulate 'em.

01:48:38.546 --> 01:48:40.247
Go on.

01:48:40.314 --> 01:48:43.184
'Oh, God, Iris,
I can't believe it.'

01:48:48.389 --> 01:48:50.391
Congratulations.

01:48:50.457 --> 01:48:53.194
Thank you.
You're wonderful wrestlers.

01:48:56.731 --> 01:49:00.935
We are the best! Champions!
We did it! We did it!

01:49:02.937 --> 01:49:05.539
What a night!
What a fight!

01:49:10.011 --> 01:49:14.649
The winners...and new tag team
champions of North America..

01:49:14.716 --> 01:49:16.851
...The California Dolls.

01:49:24.058 --> 01:49:25.226
