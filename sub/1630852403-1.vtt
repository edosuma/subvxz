1:15:45.758 --> 1:15:47.368
- She was nice.

1:15:47.412 --> 1:15:49.153
- Hmm, yeah.

1:15:51.111 --> 1:15:52.460
Do you remember her?

1:15:53.766 --> 1:15:54.637
Yeah.

1:15:55.551 --> 1:15:57.596
She always took baths,

1:15:57.640 --> 1:16:00.120
but she'd act like she
never got to take 'em,

1:16:00.164 --> 1:16:02.383
but she always took them.

1:16:02.427 --> 1:16:05.299
When she'd get home from work,
she'd clean up the kitchen,

1:16:05.343 --> 1:16:06.997
all bangy and loud.

1:16:07.040 --> 1:16:09.303
Then I'd say, "Why are
you being so loud?"

1:16:09.347 --> 1:16:10.696
"Are you mad?"

1:16:10.740 --> 1:16:12.437
Then she'd say,
"I'm not being loud."

1:16:12.480 --> 1:16:14.570
[JOHNNY LAUGHS]

1:16:16.484 --> 1:16:19.313
She wrote books,
fiction and non-fiction.

1:16:19.357 --> 1:16:21.359
[SINGING]

1:16:21.402 --> 1:16:23.274
She's always
singing old songs

1:16:23.317 --> 1:16:24.710
from when she was a kid.

1:16:33.110 --> 1:16:34.633
And in that place,
you have...

1:16:34.677 --> 1:16:36.983
She thought about
weird things, like ghosts

1:16:37.027 --> 1:16:41.379
and incarnation,
all that stuff.

1:16:41.422 --> 1:16:43.207
She'd loved it here.

1:16:44.164 --> 1:16:46.384
She taught her classes.

1:16:46.427 --> 1:16:48.081
When she was stressed out,

1:16:48.125 --> 1:16:49.692
she would just cook
herself a big steak

1:16:49.735 --> 1:16:51.476
and just eat it.

1:16:53.434 --> 1:16:55.567
She loved hanging out
with her friends.

1:16:56.873 --> 1:16:59.484
[BOTH CHUCKLE]

1:16:59.527 --> 1:17:01.834
She says even though
we love each other,

1:17:01.878 --> 1:17:04.794
she'll never know
everything about me

1:17:04.837 --> 1:17:07.797
and I'll never know
everything about her.

1:17:07.840 --> 1:17:09.625
It's just the way it is.

1:17:16.719 --> 1:17:18.938
[JOHNNY GRUNTING AND KISSING]

1:17:18.982 --> 1:17:20.244
[GIGGLING] Stop.

1:17:20.287 --> 1:17:21.941
- Um...
- You're weird.

1:17:21.985 --> 1:17:24.683
- Okay, yeah. Time to screen
time as much screen time

1:17:24.727 --> 1:17:25.989
- as he wants.
- Okay.

1:17:26.032 --> 1:17:27.555
- He can watch
anything he wants.

1:17:27.599 --> 1:17:28.818
- All the screen time he wants.
Here, here, here, here.

1:17:28.861 --> 1:17:31.037
- R-rated, anything,
anything he wants.

1:17:31.081 --> 1:17:33.474
- You have to make sure
your eyelids stay open.

1:17:33.518 --> 1:17:35.346
Get as much screen
time as possible.

1:17:35.389 --> 1:17:37.609
- If he cries or anything,
no screen time, all right?

1:17:37.653 --> 1:17:38.958
- All right.
- Yeah.

1:17:39.002 --> 1:17:40.525
- Okay, that was it, that
was your screen time.

1:17:40.568 --> 1:17:41.744
- Nice.
- Yeah.

1:17:41.787 --> 1:17:43.571
Do you feel screenful?

1:17:43.615 --> 1:17:44.616
I feel screenful.

1:17:44.660 --> 1:17:45.965
- Yeah.
- Screenish.

1:17:46.009 --> 1:17:48.054
- So do you feel like
adults understand

1:17:48.098 --> 1:17:49.926
what kids are going through?

1:17:49.969 --> 1:17:55.192
- Um, I definitely think
lots of moms do,

1:17:55.235 --> 1:17:59.544
because... I think they do.

1:17:59.587 --> 1:18:01.111
I'm curious,
like, you said this was

1:18:01.154 --> 1:18:02.939
one of the hardest
hit areas of Katrina,

1:18:02.982 --> 1:18:04.984
like, what are the
stories you've heard?

1:18:05.028 --> 1:18:08.074
Um, a guy died
in this house,

1:18:08.118 --> 1:18:12.035
but I like to believe
that ghosts are nice

1:18:12.078 --> 1:18:14.690
and they don't try
to scare people,

1:18:15.952 --> 1:18:17.910
unless that's their intention.

1:18:17.954 --> 1:18:19.129
Tell me
about that, uh,

1:18:19.172 --> 1:18:20.652
tattoo you've got on your arm.

1:18:20.696 --> 1:18:22.741
- It is nothing.
- Oh!

1:18:22.785 --> 1:18:24.047
[CHUCKLES] his is
what I... I've learned

1:18:24.090 --> 1:18:25.309
about Devante so far.

1:18:25.352 --> 1:18:27.267
Devante is like,
my business is mine.

1:18:27.311 --> 1:18:28.878
What's about that?

1:18:28.921 --> 1:18:30.096
I don't feel like talking
about that right now.

1:18:30.140 --> 1:18:31.315
What's the tattoo?

1:18:31.358 --> 1:18:32.229
Don't worry about
what's the tattoo.

1:18:32.272 --> 1:18:33.578
You know, this kinda thing.

1:18:33.621 --> 1:18:35.711
So, uh, you know, what
I appreciate about you?

1:18:35.754 --> 1:18:38.975
I appreciate the
fact that you, um...

1:18:39.018 --> 1:18:41.934
You hold what is
sacred, right?

1:18:41.978 --> 1:18:45.764
So what do you think
happens to you after you die?

1:18:45.808 --> 1:18:47.853
Well, me
and my mom are Baptists.

1:18:47.897 --> 1:18:50.421
Uh, well, I would
say heaven, I feel.

1:18:50.464 --> 1:18:51.814
I don't know how
it would be like,

1:18:51.857 --> 1:18:55.252
but what I imagine it,
uh, I would say a meadow

1:18:55.295 --> 1:18:57.863
with a one big tree,

1:18:57.907 --> 1:19:01.737
and you just lay on
the grass with flowers

1:19:01.780 --> 1:19:04.827
and you just stare
up into the sun

1:19:04.870 --> 1:19:07.133
with a lot of
breeze, obviously.

1:19:07.177 --> 1:19:08.874
You don't want it
to be too hot.

1:19:08.918 --> 1:19:12.269
Yeah, that's what
I kind of imagine.

1:19:12.312 --> 1:19:13.879
That's
really beautiful.

1:19:15.272 --> 1:19:18.405
Do you think
that the world is fair?

1:19:18.449 --> 1:19:21.582
No, nothing's
really that fair.

1:19:21.626 --> 1:19:23.715
There's always gonna be, uh,

1:19:23.759 --> 1:19:25.282
like, probably
gonna be more wars,

1:19:25.325 --> 1:19:27.893
since there's more
things to fight about

1:19:27.937 --> 1:19:32.071
if you keep on building
onto what's in the past.

1:19:32.115 --> 1:19:35.727
What causes
flooding within yourself,

1:19:35.771 --> 1:19:37.163
within whether
it's in your mind,

1:19:37.207 --> 1:19:38.904
within your heart,
within your spirit?

1:19:38.948 --> 1:19:42.429
What causes flooding,
um, within you?

1:19:44.692 --> 1:19:48.740
[CHUCKLES] Um, I think
it would be, like,

1:19:48.784 --> 1:19:50.916
not, like, feeling that,

1:19:50.960 --> 1:19:54.137
like I said no one cares
or, like, just feeling that

1:19:54.180 --> 1:19:56.313
I'm, like, alone sometimes.

1:19:56.356 --> 1:19:58.750
But I know a lot
of kids are saying,

1:19:58.794 --> 1:20:00.491
Oh, the world's gonna
end and all that.

1:20:00.534 --> 1:20:02.275
I don't think the
world's gonna end.

1:20:02.319 --> 1:20:05.452
I just think the world's
not gonna be as clean

1:20:05.496 --> 1:20:07.846
as it used to be.

1:20:07.890 --> 1:20:10.675

were your children...

1:20:11.676 --> 1:20:13.286
[CHUCKLES]

1:20:13.330 --> 1:20:15.941
What's something you
would want them to learn?

1:20:15.985 --> 1:20:17.900
What's something
you would teach 'em?

1:20:17.943 --> 1:20:22.339
Not to be selfish, not
to be bad, and not to...

1:20:22.382 --> 1:20:25.255
And not to disrespect,
and not to have...

1:20:27.039 --> 1:20:29.215
And to have close feelings

1:20:29.259 --> 1:20:31.652
for your friends,
your parents,

1:20:31.696 --> 1:20:36.919
and not to be...

1:20:36.962 --> 1:20:39.573
if I were the one to be a lead.

1:20:43.403 --> 1:20:45.536
- If you could change one
thing about yourself,

1:20:45.579 --> 1:20:47.581
what would it be?

1:20:49.627 --> 1:20:51.672
- My attitude.

1:20:51.716 --> 1:20:53.326
- [CHUCKLES] Hey, what's
wrong with your attitude?

1:20:53.370 --> 1:20:54.806
You seem like you have
a great attitude.

1:20:54.850 --> 1:20:56.068
What would you change
about yourself?

many living things.

- How's it going?
- Sensations and sounds...

1:21:18.438 --> 1:21:19.526
- Thank you.

1:21:19.570 --> 1:21:20.745
- ...will wash over

No problem.

were some tears...

- ...we ran out of snacks,

1:21:31.277 --> 1:21:32.365
the iPad died, it was
like thing after thing.

1:21:32.409 --> 1:21:33.366
We only have raisins left.

1:21:33.410 --> 1:21:35.151
- Shit.
- We don't like raisins.

go find Maurice.

- You okay?
- I'm embarrassed.

- You're embarrassed?
- That I cried.

1:21:51.863 --> 1:21:54.605
- You're embarrassed that you
cried, don't be embarrassed.

1:21:54.648 --> 1:21:56.737
- Because I don't
usually cry that much.

1:21:56.781 --> 1:21:58.130
- Huh?

1:21:58.174 --> 1:21:59.958
- I don't usually
cry that much.

1:22:00.002 --> 1:22:01.264
- It's okay.

1:22:03.831 --> 1:22:05.311
[CHUCKLES] It's all right.

1:22:05.355 --> 1:22:06.922
You mad at me?

1:22:08.140 --> 1:22:10.012
- Mmm-mmm.

1:22:10.055 --> 1:22:12.753
Can you finish that book?

1:22:14.016 --> 1:22:16.018
- Yeah.
- Please.

1:22:25.027 --> 1:22:26.637
- To visit planet Earth,

1:22:26.680 --> 1:22:29.118
you will have to be
born as a human child.

1:22:30.902 --> 1:22:34.079
At first, you'll have to
learn to use your new body,

1:22:34.123 --> 1:22:38.127
to move your arms and legs,
to pull yourself upright.

1:22:41.304 --> 1:22:45.221
You will learn to walk
and run, to use your hands

1:22:45.264 --> 1:22:49.094
to make sounds
and form words.

1:22:49.138 --> 1:22:51.967
Slowly, you will learn
to take care of yourself.

1:22:53.272 --> 1:22:55.796
Here, it is still
and peaceful,

1:22:55.840 --> 1:22:58.234
but there, the
colors, sensations,

1:22:58.277 --> 1:23:01.019
and sounds will wash
over you constantly.

1:23:02.455 --> 1:23:04.805
You will see so
many living things,

1:23:04.849 --> 1:23:07.895
plants and animals,
beyond imagining.

1:23:09.071 --> 1:23:11.116
Here, it is always the same,

1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:13.771
but there, everything
is in motion,

1:23:13.814 --> 1:23:16.469
everything is
always changing.

1:23:18.254 --> 1:23:20.560
You will be plunged into
Earth's river of time.

1:23:22.040 --> 1:23:24.260
There will be so
much for you to learn

1:23:25.696 --> 1:23:28.699
and so much for you to feel,

1:23:28.742 --> 1:23:34.226
pleasure and fear,
joy and disappointment,

1:23:34.270 --> 1:23:36.881
sadness and wonder.

1:23:39.188 --> 1:23:42.191
In your confusion
and delight,

1:23:42.234 --> 1:23:44.454
you will forget
where you came from.

1:23:46.108 --> 1:23:49.589
You will grow up,
travel, and work.

1:23:50.982 --> 1:23:52.679
Perhaps, you'll
have children,

1:23:52.723 --> 1:23:54.551
even grandchildren
of your own.

1:23:55.943 --> 1:23:57.684
Over the years, you will
try to make sense

1:23:57.728 --> 1:24:02.124
of that happy,
sad, full, empty,

1:24:02.167 --> 1:24:04.474
always-shifting
life you're in.

1:24:05.953 --> 1:24:08.086
And when the time comes
to return to your star,

1:24:09.348 --> 1:24:11.698
it may be hard
to say "goodbye"

1:24:11.742 --> 1:24:14.614
to that strangely
beautiful world.

1:24:16.312 --> 1:24:17.617
Damn this book.

1:24:17.661 --> 1:24:19.358
- You're crying.

1:24:19.402 --> 1:24:20.577
- No, I'm not.

1:24:20.620 --> 1:24:21.969
- Yes, you are.

1:24:23.406 --> 1:24:25.886
You're definitely cry...
See, you're cry...

1:24:25.930 --> 1:24:26.974
[JOHNNY CHUCKLES]

1:24:27.018 --> 1:24:28.628
- No, it's just...
It's true.

1:24:29.673 --> 1:24:31.240
We forget everything.

1:24:32.719 --> 1:24:34.852
- No, I don't, you do.
You're stupid.

1:24:36.549 --> 1:24:39.074
- Yeah, you'll barely
remember this.

1:24:39.117 --> 1:24:42.251
You'll have, like, a few
blurry memories

1:24:42.294 --> 1:24:44.166
of this whole trip.

1:24:44.209 --> 1:24:46.429
That's...
That's very stupid.

1:24:46.472 --> 1:24:48.953
You're just the
stupidest, stupid person.

1:24:48.996 --> 1:24:50.346
[CHUCKLES]

1:24:50.389 --> 1:24:53.610
Ever. And, like, you have

1:46:39.654 --> 1:46:41.743
I'm not saying this is
completely true or whatever,

1:46:41.786 --> 1:46:43.309
it's just what I've heard,

1:46:43.353 --> 1:46:45.007
but, uh, your brain

1:46:45.050 --> 1:46:46.487
has to knock out
some old memories

1:46:46.530 --> 1:46:49.359
to be able to save new ones.

1:46:49.403 --> 1:46:51.970
So I feel like there's
two types of Americans, like,

1:46:52.014 --> 1:46:53.842
people who can constantly
get what they want

1:46:53.885 --> 1:46:55.321
and have what they need,

1:46:55.365 --> 1:46:56.671
and then there's
the other type

1:46:56.714 --> 1:46:58.324
where they kind of
have to struggle

1:46:58.368 --> 1:47:02.328
and work harder for the
things that they need.

1:47:02.372 --> 1:47:04.069
It's not
the way we look,

1:47:04.113 --> 1:47:06.724
but it's, like, how we are
on the inside that's...

1:47:06.768 --> 1:47:10.380
Just like you can't judge
a book by its cover,

1:47:10.424 --> 1:47:13.601
it's the same with humans.

1:47:13.644 --> 1:47:17.518
So I like to look at
the positive side of things.

1:47:17.561 --> 1:47:20.434
Um, I like to think about,

1:47:20.477 --> 1:47:22.348
um, like new
inventions that might

1:47:22.392 --> 1:47:25.395
actually help save the world.

1:47:25.439 --> 1:47:28.964
I think about going into space
and discovering a new planet

1:47:29.007 --> 1:47:32.794
and then maybe like
building a life there.

1:47:32.837 --> 1:47:35.405
What do you hope
that you really remember

1:47:35.449 --> 1:47:37.581
about your mom and your dad?

1:47:37.625 --> 1:47:39.844
That they were
always there for me,

1:47:39.888 --> 1:47:43.021
that they always love me.
They say...[CHUCKLES]

1:47:43.065 --> 1:47:44.675
I tell her

1:47:44.719 --> 1:47:47.461
good night
every night and...

1:47:47.504 --> 1:47:50.202
[SNIFFLES] I always tell
her that I love her,

1:47:50.246 --> 1:47:52.596
just like out of the blue
and she would do the same.

1:47:52.640 --> 1:47:54.337
[VOICE BREAKS]
And I really feel

1:47:54.380 --> 1:47:56.339
that strong
connection with her.

1:47:56.382 --> 1:47:59.864
If you could
have any superpower,

1:47:59.908 --> 1:48:01.779
what would it be?

1:48:01.823 --> 1:48:04.042
The ability to
bend space and time.

1:48:04.086 --> 1:48:06.697
[JOHNNY AND BOY 6 CHUCKLE]

1:48:06.741 --> 1:48:09.787
If you were what
you believe is a good person

1:48:09.831 --> 1:48:11.746
and you ask whoever
you believe in,

1:48:11.789 --> 1:48:13.835
Hey, can I be reincarnated

1:48:13.878 --> 1:48:15.619
into, I don't know,
like a tiger?

1:48:15.663 --> 1:48:17.447
And you were a good person
then they would be like,

1:48:17.491 --> 1:48:18.883
Yeah, you can be a
tiger, go ahead.

1:48:18.927 --> 1:48:21.930
[TRAIN CHUGGING]

1:48:21.973 --> 1:48:25.194
Well, I feel
like if we die,

1:48:25.237 --> 1:48:27.544
like, we don't
really feel anything,

1:48:27.588 --> 1:48:29.720
all like memories
are gone and stuff.

1:48:29.764 --> 1:48:32.244
And we're just like,
we'll just see you wait

1:48:32.288 --> 1:48:34.856
becoming a baby.[CHUCKLES]

1:48:34.899 --> 1:48:36.379
And, yeah,

1:48:36.422 --> 1:48:38.860
getting born and then
just restarting life.

1:48:38.903 --> 1:48:42.211
Like, I'm not sure 'cause
I've never been dead before.

1:48:43.429 --> 1:48:44.561
Sit down

1:48:44.605 --> 1:48:46.781
and close your eyes,

1:48:46.824 --> 1:48:49.914
and try to find yourself.

1:48:49.958 --> 1:48:54.310
Because I feel like that's
what you really have to do,

1:48:54.353 --> 1:48:56.486
to know what you want.

1:48:56.530 --> 1:49:01.273
Like, find a way that you feel
comfortable finding yourself.

1:49:02.884 --> 1:49:05.539
You know, you gotta
find to find.
