WEBVTT

00:10.244 --> 00:13.712
It's very, very bad
out here.

00:13.714 --> 00:16.782
I feel, like,
a knife in the gut.

00:16.784 --> 00:18.183
I think it wants to kill us.

00:18.185 --> 00:19.518
Something just ain't right
with that house.

00:21.288 --> 00:23.021
He did not die well.

00:23.023 --> 00:25.023
They decided they would have
a lynching party.

00:26.994 --> 00:30.162
- Your life is in jeopardy.
- You believe me now?

00:30.164 --> 00:32.531
He says,
"I'm gonna kill them."

00:32.533 --> 00:34.900
That's his end goal.

00:36.070 --> 00:38.670
Panic, panic, panic.

00:38.672 --> 00:40.506
My name is Amy Allan.

00:40.508 --> 00:42.340
I'm seeing, like, blood.

00:42.342 --> 00:45.644
The house just feels <i> bad.</i>

00:45.646 --> 00:46.912
I see dead people.

00:46.914 --> 00:51.283
This man
is <i> completely</i> insane.

00:51.285 --> 00:54.453
I speak to dead people...

00:54.455 --> 00:56.622
Whoo. Okay.
She doesn't like it in there.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.690
...and they speak to me.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.692
He likes to twist that knife.

01:00.694 --> 01:04.163
But there's only one way to know
if my findings are real.

01:04.165 --> 01:07.833
Something paranormal
is trying to kill them.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.401
I rely on my partner.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.903
I'm Steve DiSchiavi.

01:10.905 --> 01:13.238
I'm a retired New York City
homicide detective.

01:13.240 --> 01:14.906
Now does he die right there,
on the spot?

01:14.908 --> 01:18.810
I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.446
I think it's trying
to steal my soul.

01:21.448 --> 01:23.282
It's my job to reveal them.

01:23.284 --> 01:25.584
You ever get touched
like that again?

01:25.586 --> 01:27.486
But Steve and I never speak...

01:27.488 --> 01:29.521
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:29.523 --> 01:30.889
...until the very end.

01:30.891 --> 01:33.125
I'm as stunned as you guys are.

01:33.127 --> 01:34.960
When we uncover if
it's safe for you to stay...

01:34.962 --> 01:37.629
I don't want anything
to happen to my daughter.

01:37.631 --> 01:39.064
Or time to get out.

01:39.066 --> 01:42.401
His goal
is to kill you guys.

01:44.000 --> 01:50.074

01:55.882 --> 01:57.816
So, I'm out here
in Jones, Alabama.

01:57.818 --> 01:59.751
It's about an hour west
of Montgomery.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.187
I got a call from a woman
named Kimberly.

02:02.189 --> 02:05.290
She says the second she moved
her elderly mom into the house,

02:05.292 --> 02:06.959
all hell broke loose.

02:06.961 --> 02:08.759
She says no one is safe

02:08.762 --> 02:11.296
and literally begged us
to come help her out.

02:16.303 --> 02:17.636
Before Amy arrives,

02:17.638 --> 02:21.439
I clear the area
of any leading information.

02:21.441 --> 02:24.076
This home has a lot
of family photos

02:24.078 --> 02:26.444
and unique personal items,

02:26.446 --> 02:30.315
so it's important that I cover
or remove them all.

02:30.317 --> 02:33.452
When I'm done, the location will
be ready for tonight's walk.

02:42.730 --> 02:44.396
Jeez.

02:44.398 --> 02:48.934
There's something here
that was left to rot,

02:48.936 --> 02:51.904
and it feels malicious.

02:51.906 --> 02:54.539
Very, very, very bad out here.

02:54.541 --> 02:57.442
Living people would feel fear,

02:57.444 --> 02:59.544
and anytime they'd try
to confront it,

02:59.546 --> 03:01.013
it's, like, poof, gone.

03:08.088 --> 03:09.488
Well, Kimberly,
when we spoke on the phone

03:09.490 --> 03:11.522
you could barely
hold it together.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.025
What the hell
is going on here?

03:13.027 --> 03:15.427
This is a house
in darkness and despair.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.629
Whatever is here
is ruining our business.

03:17.631 --> 03:19.197
It's destroying our livelihood.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.033
- You guys run a business?
- Yes.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.101
- What's the story with that?
- My brother Kenny and I

03:23.103 --> 03:26.738
run a transmission business
here on the property.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.873
It's become very dangerous
at the shop,

03:28.875 --> 03:31.243
and Kenny's on the verge
of leaving us,

03:31.245 --> 03:32.911
walking away
from this business.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.446
Now is activity affecting
things in the house, too?

03:35.448 --> 03:37.115
- Yes.
- Okay.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.984
All right,
so who all lives here?

03:38.986 --> 03:41.486
My mother, Henrietta.

03:41.488 --> 03:43.522
Okay.

03:43.524 --> 03:46.992
My husband, Leo,
and my brother, Kenny.

03:46.994 --> 03:50.062
So as far as activity goes,
what are you guys experiencing?

03:50.064 --> 03:53.865
We've had banging noises,
things moving on their own.

03:53.867 --> 03:57.002
We've had things breaking
for no apparent reason,

03:57.004 --> 03:59.270
shadow figures
and apparitions here,

03:59.272 --> 04:02.040
and now
it's physical attacks.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.076
Things have gotten
so bad here, Steve,

04:04.078 --> 04:07.279
our family has started to refer
to our house as "Hell House."

04:07.281 --> 04:10.382
- Hell House?
- Exactly.

04:10.384 --> 04:13.652
You mentioned to me on the phone
that stuff started happening

04:13.654 --> 04:15.553
when you moved your mom in.
- Yes.

04:15.555 --> 04:17.656
All right,
so what's the story there?

04:17.658 --> 04:19.791
She's elderly and she's
in the first stages

04:19.793 --> 04:22.127
of Alzheimer's disease.

04:22.129 --> 04:23.295
As soon
as we brought her in,

04:23.297 --> 04:26.097
things just got
from bad to worse.

04:26.099 --> 04:28.566
I don't think it's safe
for her to be here,

04:28.568 --> 04:30.569
or really any of us,
for that matter.

04:30.571 --> 04:33.238
So with this insane activity
you've got here,

04:33.240 --> 04:34.873
how is it affecting you?

04:34.875 --> 04:37.743
I'm tired all the time.
I have trouble sleeping.

04:37.745 --> 04:39.344
What do you think is here?

04:39.346 --> 04:43.048
I'm not sure, but my family has
always said that we were cursed

04:43.050 --> 04:45.417
because my grandfather
was a moonshiner

04:45.419 --> 04:48.820
and supposedly had
killed someone.

04:48.822 --> 04:50.855
I've been told that
since I was a child.

04:50.857 --> 04:52.124
You know, I'll make sure
I look into that.

04:52.126 --> 04:54.392
What do you think it wants?

04:54.394 --> 04:57.462
I think it wants
to kill us, Steve.

04:57.464 --> 04:58.963
I can't take it anymore.

04:58.965 --> 05:00.666
That's why we need your help.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.507
No.

05:11.644 --> 05:13.611
Something happened in here
freaked somebody out,

05:13.613 --> 05:16.948
living-wise, and it's a female.

05:16.950 --> 05:18.183
Things are, like, falling.

05:20.187 --> 05:23.755
Things are breaking
or temporarily shutting down.

05:23.757 --> 05:28.259
Something triggered spontaneous
psychokinesis kind of episodes.

05:28.261 --> 05:30.361
This person is going
through something right now,

05:30.363 --> 05:33.298
extreme stress.

05:33.300 --> 05:36.201
It seems more, like,
dormant abilities

05:36.203 --> 05:37.803
that are suddenly coming out.

05:44.377 --> 05:46.778
Okay, Kimberly,
so what's going on in here?

05:46.780 --> 05:49.114
Things move on their own here.

05:49.116 --> 05:50.515
Okay, give me an example.

05:50.517 --> 05:53.718
You can put something down, like
a set of keys or a cellphone,

05:53.720 --> 05:56.554
come back five minutes
later, and it's gone.

05:56.556 --> 05:58.590
- Okay, nobody's playing games?
- No.

05:58.592 --> 05:59.991
Anything else in this room?

05:59.993 --> 06:01.526
We've also had shadow figures

06:01.528 --> 06:03.661
walking through from
this room to the hall.

06:03.663 --> 06:06.264
I know you got animals.
Are you sure it's not an animal?

06:06.266 --> 06:08.266
The animals never
come into this room.

06:08.268 --> 06:10.268
- Is it a human form?
- Yes.

06:10.270 --> 06:13.538
Okay. All right, so you have
quite a few things

06:13.540 --> 06:14.973
going on in this room.

06:14.975 --> 06:18.477
I feel like I'm dealing with
all this negativity all alone,

06:18.479 --> 06:19.911
all by myself.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.847
It just feels like
pure evil.

06:25.485 --> 06:27.419
Living people here

06:27.421 --> 06:29.921
would experience

06:29.923 --> 06:31.289
seeing things

06:31.291 --> 06:33.558
out of the corner
of their eyes.

06:35.695 --> 06:40.198
I see a young male
standing by in dark shadows.

06:40.200 --> 06:44.503
He has these things
that are not human with him.

06:45.905 --> 06:47.705
They look like tree limbs.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.240
He says it took him
a lot of years

06:49.242 --> 06:51.642
to learn how to control
these things.

06:51.644 --> 06:54.378
What does he do to them?

06:54.380 --> 06:56.515
He uses them
to torture the living.

07:05.325 --> 07:06.791
What's going on in here?

07:06.793 --> 07:08.260
This is kind of the heart

07:08.262 --> 07:11.296
of the worst negativity
in the house.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.598
We hear tapping on
the windows all the time.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.933
So do you ever investigate?

07:14.935 --> 07:16.434
- Yes, we have.
- And?

07:16.436 --> 07:19.070
There's never anything there
or anybody there.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.338
Anything else?

07:20.340 --> 07:22.274
I've had nightmares
in this room,

07:22.276 --> 07:25.744
and when I wake up,
I feel like I can't breathe,

07:25.746 --> 07:27.912
and it causes
heart palpitations.

07:27.914 --> 07:29.815
You take any medication
that would cause side effects?

07:29.817 --> 07:31.683
No, no medications
whatsoever.

07:31.685 --> 07:33.551
Anything else happen to you?

07:33.553 --> 07:36.721
One time, I was
held down in this bed.

07:36.723 --> 07:39.557
It felt like
two very strong hands

07:39.559 --> 07:41.626
pressing down on my ankles.

07:41.628 --> 07:43.828
From the waist down,
I couldn't move.

07:43.830 --> 07:45.463
Okay. And where was
your husband?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.698
On this side of the bed.
He was asleep.

07:47.700 --> 07:49.700
When I realized that
it wasn't my husband,

07:49.702 --> 07:52.037
that he was not touching me
in any way, I screamed,

07:52.039 --> 07:55.106
and he jumped up and turned
the light on, and it released.

07:55.108 --> 07:56.441
What do you think that was?

07:56.443 --> 07:59.644
It wasn't anything nice.
It was something evil.

07:59.646 --> 08:01.713
That's the most terrifying thing
that's happened to me.

08:09.589 --> 08:11.022
You doing all right?

08:12.692 --> 08:14.492
Not really.

08:14.494 --> 08:16.228
It's very emotional.

08:18.465 --> 08:20.598
I'm afraid for my mom.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.335
Okay. I know.

08:23.337 --> 08:25.270
I know. You all right?

08:27.074 --> 08:29.140
I'm sorry.

08:29.142 --> 08:31.142
I'm just frightened for her.

08:38.918 --> 08:42.953
The man with the tree limbs
likes this room.

08:42.956 --> 08:46.424
Okay. I'm seeing I think what
they're seeing, and it's creepy.

08:48.028 --> 08:51.562
Okay, so this person is seeing
this long, weird shape,

08:51.564 --> 08:54.532
like, this lanky shadow man.

08:54.534 --> 09:00.505
And I feel like the female
in this bed sees him

09:00.507 --> 09:02.307
and is, like, frozen.

09:02.309 --> 09:04.876
It seems like
they're struggling.

09:04.878 --> 09:08.346
So I guess the trees
paralyze that person,

09:08.348 --> 09:10.114
then over there...

09:10.116 --> 09:13.585
they're seeing the branches
coming for them.

09:15.455 --> 09:17.422
They're like hands.

09:17.424 --> 09:22.527
They're going inside the person
and, like, settling in organs.

09:22.529 --> 09:24.395
I think they feel sick
afterwards,

09:24.397 --> 09:26.931
causing, like,
illnesses that way.

09:26.933 --> 09:28.666
But I think long-term,

09:28.668 --> 09:32.270
it could turn into
something like cancer.

09:32.272 --> 09:34.105
They're scared.

09:34.107 --> 09:36.674
What kind of threat
does he pose?

09:36.676 --> 09:40.312
Well, he just says, you know,
"I'm gonna kill them."

09:40.314 --> 09:43.081
That's his end goal.

10:02.535 --> 10:04.169
So, Kenny, I was talking
to your sister, and she says

10:04.171 --> 10:06.637
you run the business
here on the property.

10:06.639 --> 10:08.740
Yes, sir. We do
transmission work, yes, sir.

10:08.742 --> 10:10.808
In her opinion,
she doesn't feel it's safe

10:10.810 --> 10:12.910
for anybody to be here.
I mean, do you agree with that?

10:12.912 --> 10:15.380
I agree 100% with her.

10:15.382 --> 10:18.049
I'm just afraid that
it's gonna hurt somebody.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.318
So your sister mentioned to me
that you're just getting ready

10:20.320 --> 10:21.686
to get the hell out of here.

10:21.688 --> 10:24.655
Yeah, I want to get out
of that house.

10:24.657 --> 10:27.092
What experiences can you
tell me about, Kenny?

10:27.094 --> 10:28.927
I was working on
a truck out here.

10:28.929 --> 10:30.461
First thing I did was
crank it up,

10:30.463 --> 10:33.264
and boom, both batteries
just blew up.

10:33.266 --> 10:35.332
Plastic, acid everywhere.

10:35.334 --> 10:37.302
Okay, so do you know
what caused it to explode?

10:37.304 --> 10:40.771
No, sir. There was no battery
charger hooked to it.

10:40.773 --> 10:42.506
The battery cables
were tight.

10:42.508 --> 10:44.809
I thought it was gonna
take the hood off.

10:44.811 --> 10:46.344
I don't know if
it's paranormal or not,

10:46.346 --> 10:48.013
but you're the expert
on cars.

10:48.015 --> 10:49.413
- Right.
- What do you think?

10:49.415 --> 10:51.649
I've been in this business
for over 40 years,

10:51.651 --> 10:53.284
and I've never seen it happen.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.987
- I think it was paranormal.
- Okay.

10:55.989 --> 10:58.556
All right, so you've had
car batteries explode on you.

10:58.558 --> 11:00.024
Anything else?

11:00.026 --> 11:04.829
I was out in the backyard
and I seen a wolf-like creature.

11:04.831 --> 11:06.230
Okay, can you
describe it for me?

11:06.232 --> 11:09.434
6- foot tall,
green, egg-shaped eyes.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.836
It just walked from one tree
to the next tree.

11:11.838 --> 11:13.037
All right, you sure
you weren't drinking?

11:13.039 --> 11:15.573
I wasn't drinking, no, sir.

11:15.575 --> 11:18.042
- All right, anything else?
- I have attitude changes.

11:18.044 --> 11:20.845
We can come in from a trip,
be just as happy as can be,

11:20.847 --> 11:23.448
and walk in that house,
it will all fall apart.

11:23.450 --> 11:26.250
The attitudes become evil,
plumb evil.

11:26.252 --> 11:28.119
That house has put
something into you,

11:28.121 --> 11:31.322
like, it's a hatred,
dark side.

11:31.324 --> 11:32.657
Anything else?

11:32.659 --> 11:34.659
It drains all your energy.

11:34.661 --> 11:39.096
It's like a battery. It just
sucks all everything out of you.

11:39.098 --> 11:41.432
Something just ain't right
with that house up there.

11:41.434 --> 11:43.401
I do believe
it's trying to hurt us.

11:43.403 --> 11:47.605
It can kill you or cause
somebody to get killed.

11:47.607 --> 11:48.740
Okay.

11:52.345 --> 11:56.181
Getting an older man,
this dead guy.

11:56.183 --> 11:58.216
He's not a good person.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.750
Mnh-mnh.

11:59.752 --> 12:01.852
No, I don't like him.

12:01.854 --> 12:03.855
He's, like, yelling
at somebody down there.

12:03.857 --> 12:07.691
Like, freaking out on someone.

12:07.693 --> 12:10.762
So his anger, you can feel it.
It goes right into you.

12:10.764 --> 12:12.763
I think that the living
would feel the anger.

12:12.765 --> 12:17.368
He's moving things all the time.

12:17.370 --> 12:19.704
Living people would put
something someplace

12:19.706 --> 12:22.407
and then, say,
an hour later, come back

12:22.409 --> 12:23.707
and it's, like, over there.

12:23.709 --> 12:24.975
You know what I mean?

12:28.247 --> 12:30.381
Not good. Mnh-mnh.

12:30.383 --> 12:35.253
He might be a little bit
more powerful than I thought.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.989
I feel sick.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.524
Just sucks energy.
It just zaps people.

12:40.526 --> 12:43.261
Anything that the living
might experience within here?

12:43.263 --> 12:45.530
You know, they walk in here
with energy

12:45.532 --> 12:47.865
and all of a sudden, it's gone,

12:47.867 --> 12:51.769
and so feeling extremely
lethargic, exhausted.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.671
What kind of long-term effects
might that have?

12:53.673 --> 12:57.508
Their immune system
would get pretty run down.

12:57.510 --> 13:00.077
They could develop, like,
bronchitis, pneumonias,

13:00.079 --> 13:01.813
you know, things like that.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.621
Leo, I was talking
to your wife.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.489
She doesn't feel it's safe
to be in this house.

13:11.491 --> 13:12.590
I mean,
do you agree with that?

13:12.592 --> 13:14.558
I believe it is
dangerous for her.

13:14.560 --> 13:16.561
- But not for you?
- Not really.

13:16.563 --> 13:18.696
So have you had
experiences in the house?

13:18.698 --> 13:20.565
- I have.
- Okay, let's talk about them.

13:20.567 --> 13:22.767
It seems anything
electronic breaks.

13:22.769 --> 13:24.102
Okay, so what kind
of things are breaking?

13:24.104 --> 13:27.838
Satellite boxes, printers,
carpet shampooers.

13:27.840 --> 13:29.140
What makes you think
that has anything to do

13:29.142 --> 13:30.507
with the paranormal?

13:30.509 --> 13:33.845
If it was one thing or two
things, but this is everything.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.046
Okay, what else?

13:35.048 --> 13:37.081
I have seen a black shadow

13:37.083 --> 13:38.515
walking through the hallway,

13:38.517 --> 13:39.784
right out of the corner
of my eye.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.785
How big do you think
this thing was?

13:41.787 --> 13:43.153
About this high.

13:43.155 --> 13:45.590
When I turned to look,
nothing was there.

13:45.592 --> 13:47.791
You may not be taking
this seriously enough.

13:47.793 --> 13:49.861
Your wife is scared
of her own house.

13:49.863 --> 13:51.528
Is it a strain
on your marriage?

13:51.530 --> 13:54.965
Definitely. It's stressful.
I love her. I can't lose her.

13:54.967 --> 13:57.067
Her safety has got to be
the most important thing.

13:57.069 --> 13:59.871
I do love the house,
but I love my wife more.

14:04.210 --> 14:07.679
It's not good back here.
I see people fighting.

14:07.681 --> 14:09.814
How many people are
involved?

14:09.816 --> 14:12.216
Like, 20 to 30.

14:12.218 --> 14:14.152
They're so damn solid,

14:14.154 --> 14:15.819
so I think that
the living people

14:15.821 --> 14:20.424
would see shadow people
out here.

14:20.426 --> 14:23.227
They're very angry and upset.

14:23.229 --> 14:26.564
They don't want living people
out there.

14:26.566 --> 14:29.567
How might the living
be affected by them?

14:29.569 --> 14:33.371
They create bad luck,
mechanically.

14:33.373 --> 14:37.108
I see them messing with vehicles
and electronic equipment.

14:37.110 --> 14:39.843
I think living people
would feel the anxiety,

14:39.845 --> 14:42.780
absolutely, out here,
horrible anxiety.

14:42.782 --> 14:45.183
I feel vertigo.
I feel dizzy. I feel sick.

14:45.185 --> 14:47.118
Emotionally, they would
feel threatened,

14:47.120 --> 14:51.189
they would feel fear, anger,
not -- not safe.

15:05.538 --> 15:07.338
Now usually,
my clients don't have a clue

15:07.340 --> 15:09.907
what's haunting their house,

15:09.909 --> 15:13.311
but Kimberly thinks it could be
her own family's dark past.

15:13.313 --> 15:14.612
So I had a retired detective
look into

15:14.614 --> 15:16.314
her grandfather's case for me,

15:16.316 --> 15:18.883
and he confirmed
there was a homicide.

15:18.885 --> 15:21.219
He said what started
as a family disagreement

15:21.221 --> 15:22.820
ended in bloodshed
and heartache.

15:31.864 --> 15:33.998
So, Shannon, I know
my client's grandfather

15:34.000 --> 15:35.866
was involved
in a homicide somehow.

15:35.868 --> 15:37.368
What the hell happened?

15:37.370 --> 15:40.872
Well, your client's
grandfather, Daniel Lockhart,

15:40.874 --> 15:43.941
was the perpetrator
of a homicide.

15:43.943 --> 15:46.577
I've got a couple of photos
of Dan Lockhart here.

15:50.450 --> 15:54.352
On the afternoon
of October the 20th of 1934,

15:54.354 --> 15:56.020
Dan was driving along

15:56.022 --> 15:58.856
in the area of
Billingsley, Alabama,

15:58.858 --> 16:01.926
when his cousin,
Cicero Arnold Johnson,

16:01.928 --> 16:03.027
passes him in the road.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.462
They wave each other down,

16:04.464 --> 16:06.096
and they're on the side
of the road

16:06.098 --> 16:07.932
and they get into
an altercation.

16:07.934 --> 16:09.467
So what the hell happened?

16:09.469 --> 16:11.936
Dan called Cicero
a derogatory name,

16:11.938 --> 16:13.137
and the fight is on.

16:13.139 --> 16:15.072
Some point,
Dan pulls out a knife

16:15.074 --> 16:17.909
and slashes Cicero
several times

16:17.911 --> 16:22.279
and cuts Cicero pretty severely
on his arms and in his torso,

16:22.281 --> 16:25.082
catches him in his stomach,
cuts an artery,

16:25.084 --> 16:28.085
and Cicero dies
on the operating table.

16:28.087 --> 16:30.688
Here's an Alabama
death certificate for Cicero.

16:30.690 --> 16:33.357
Do we know what prompted
him calling him names

16:33.359 --> 16:35.859
or what started this fight?
Well, we don't know exactly.

16:35.861 --> 16:38.229
There is some rumor
that both of these men

16:38.231 --> 16:41.465
might have been involved
in the moonshine business.

16:41.467 --> 16:42.900
All right, it's a pretty
cut and dry case.

16:42.902 --> 16:44.235
Does he get caught
and convicted?

16:44.237 --> 16:47.438
He's sentenced to five years
and he actually serves four.

16:47.440 --> 16:50.574
It sounds like it was
a pretty lenient sentencing.

16:50.576 --> 16:52.877
Yes.
Do we ever hear
from this guy again?

16:52.879 --> 16:54.846
Apparently, he leads
a pretty quiet life

16:54.848 --> 16:57.749
and he passes away in 1976
at the age of 81.

17:01.054 --> 17:03.821
There's some dead guy
back up in here.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.522
He did not die well.

17:05.525 --> 17:06.990
He's white.

17:06.992 --> 17:10.327
And he's trapped
and can't get out.

17:10.329 --> 17:15.500
And I feel, like,
being stabbed in the gut.

17:15.502 --> 17:19.270
Stabbed in my left shoulder.
Lots of pain on the left side.

17:19.271 --> 17:22.873
So sick.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.509
My lordy. Brutal.

17:27.880 --> 17:30.347
So as soon as I got to
town, I dug through the deeds.

17:30.349 --> 17:31.949
Turns out Kimberly's property
was part

17:31.951 --> 17:34.285
of one of the biggest
slave plantations

17:34.287 --> 17:35.586
in the state of Alabama.

17:35.588 --> 17:37.087
I'm heading over to meet
with an historian

17:37.089 --> 17:39.023
who says the owner was
a ruthless man

17:39.025 --> 17:41.558
who let nothing stand in the way
of his own greed.

17:48.201 --> 17:49.667
Now you mentioned
on the phone

17:49.669 --> 17:52.036
the guy that owned my client's
property was driven by greed.

17:52.038 --> 17:53.604
What can you tell me
about this guy?

17:53.606 --> 17:55.706
His name was Jabez Curry.

17:55.708 --> 17:56.941
Here's a picture of him
right there.

17:56.943 --> 18:02.246
He came from Georgia
to Alabama in 1823.

18:02.248 --> 18:03.881
He's 27 years old.

18:03.883 --> 18:06.116
And your client's land
was in a parcel

18:06.118 --> 18:08.385
that he bought
beginning in 1829.

18:08.387 --> 18:13.391
He eventually owned
2,800 acres.

18:13.393 --> 18:16.928
What he was looking for was
to establish a cotton empire.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.596
How much was he worth
in today's time?

18:18.598 --> 18:21.198
In 1860,
the census reports him

18:21.200 --> 18:25.469
as having a wealth
of $340,000.

18:25.471 --> 18:29.206
That's worth
$9.5 to $10 million today.

18:29.208 --> 18:30.941
- Okay.
- He was very successful,

18:30.943 --> 18:32.810
but he couldn't
get that cotton crop in

18:32.812 --> 18:34.712
except on the back
of slaves.

18:34.714 --> 18:36.813
Now do we have any idea
how many slaves he owned

18:36.815 --> 18:38.315
while he was on
my client's property?

18:38.317 --> 18:42.220
By 1860, he had over 155.

18:42.222 --> 18:45.356
Wow.
I mean, that's incredible.

18:45.358 --> 18:46.757
I've done
a lot of these cases

18:46.759 --> 18:49.093
with a lot of the history
regarding slaves,

18:49.095 --> 18:51.228
and people that had
three and four slaves

18:51.230 --> 18:52.496
were considered wealthy.

19:02.041 --> 19:06.010
I'm seeing the shadow guy
with the tree limbs again.

19:06.012 --> 19:08.512
Do you get anything
on who he was in life?

19:08.514 --> 19:11.381
I get that he's more Southern.

19:11.383 --> 19:13.384
He's young, wealthy.

19:13.386 --> 19:19.423
When this guy was alive,
he was into something dark.

19:19.425 --> 19:22.059
There's a lot of land
involved with this.

19:22.061 --> 19:23.360
He's, like,
babbling about, like,

19:23.362 --> 19:27.598
collecting what's his
and just talking about owning --

19:27.600 --> 19:30.501
owning everybody,
like, families,

19:30.503 --> 19:32.870
and he says he owns everyone.

19:37.209 --> 19:39.810
So, Doc, I know the slaves
were treated pretty horribly.

19:39.812 --> 19:42.079
I mean, is this guy any
different from anybody else?

19:42.081 --> 19:43.447
Probably not.

19:43.449 --> 19:45.950
What we know about Jabez Curry
comes from two letters

19:45.952 --> 19:49.987
he wrote to his son
in June of 1862.

19:49.989 --> 19:52.089
He describes a drought,

19:52.091 --> 19:54.224
and his supply lines
were constricted

19:54.226 --> 19:56.493
because of
a Civil War battle nearby.

19:56.495 --> 20:02.399
What Curry did was to cut
his slaves to half meat rations.

20:02.401 --> 20:04.368
What about his family?
Did they take half-rations?

20:04.370 --> 20:07.538
They did not go on
half-rations themselves.

20:07.540 --> 20:08.905
Without them getting fed,

20:08.907 --> 20:10.907
how are they going to work
so that he can make money?

20:10.909 --> 20:12.510
That's why he left them
on half-rations

20:12.512 --> 20:15.379
instead of cutting rations
entirely.

20:15.381 --> 20:18.348
Okay, so he was driven
by greed.

20:18.350 --> 20:20.117
- This is 1862.
- Right.

20:20.119 --> 20:22.053
Now, we know the war didn't
go well for the South.

20:22.055 --> 20:23.321
What happens
to Curry's slaves?

20:23.323 --> 20:24.955
The slaves were emancipated.

20:24.957 --> 20:28.593
It appears that many of Curry's
slaves stayed on the plantation

20:28.595 --> 20:30.461
and worked for him
as sharecroppers.

20:30.463 --> 20:32.329
So how did this sharecropping
work out for the slaves?

20:32.331 --> 20:35.232
It was a system that no one
was ever happy with.

20:35.234 --> 20:36.600
Sharecroppers would sign

20:36.602 --> 20:38.802
an annual contract
with the landowner.

20:38.804 --> 20:42.939
Sharecroppers were then
indebted to the landowner

20:42.941 --> 20:45.810
and could not leave
until they paid their debt.

20:45.812 --> 20:48.879
- So they were slaves still.
- Basically, yeah.

20:48.881 --> 20:50.281
Whatever happens with Curry?

20:50.283 --> 20:52.783
He died in January of 1871.

20:52.785 --> 20:54.485
He was about 72 years old,

20:54.487 --> 20:56.120
and we're unsure
of what he died from.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.287
Okay.

21:00.226 --> 21:04.362
Out here, I get
a lot of death and violence.

21:04.364 --> 21:09.533
Very, very bad out here.
I'm hearing men yelling.

21:09.535 --> 21:13.103
It's those dead guys who are
always fighting outside.

21:13.105 --> 21:16.040
And they're just wearing,
like, a little grass skirt,

21:16.042 --> 21:17.708
and they have spears.

21:17.710 --> 21:22.046
It looks tribal,
more like African.

21:22.048 --> 21:24.582
They're kind of still fighting,

21:24.584 --> 21:28.051
and it feels like
no one really won.

21:28.053 --> 21:29.987
Do you have any idea
when this was?

21:31.524 --> 21:35.059
1830s or 1840s?

21:38.264 --> 21:39.864
Some dude is like,

21:39.866 --> 21:44.868
"This is the moment
of our discontent.

21:44.870 --> 21:48.806
This is the moment
of our death."

22:16.502 --> 22:19.236
So far, I've got a client
claiming paranormal activity

22:19.238 --> 22:21.572
is ruining her business
and her family's life,

22:21.574 --> 22:23.207
on a property
once owned by a man

22:23.209 --> 22:26.710
who had over 155 slaves.

22:26.712 --> 22:29.346
But I need to see
if there's anything else.

22:29.348 --> 22:32.783
Searching through old records,
I come across Alexander McQueen,

22:32.785 --> 22:35.553
who used to own Kim's land
back in the late 1800s.

22:35.555 --> 22:37.521
It turns out
McQueen was involved

22:37.523 --> 22:42.192
in a lynching of a local
black man during his time there.

22:42.194 --> 22:43.894
So I'm headed over
to meet a local author

22:43.896 --> 22:47.398
who says this was
a classic case of mob rule,

22:47.400 --> 22:49.566
and this poor guy's death
could have been stopped

22:49.568 --> 22:51.268
if it hadn't been
for the previous owner

22:51.270 --> 22:52.536
of Kimberly's property.

22:59.344 --> 23:00.678
Well, Dr. Bailey,
thanks for meeting with me.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.079
I appreciate that.

23:02.081 --> 23:04.414
What were the circumstances
that led up to the lynching?

23:04.416 --> 23:08.218
Wednesday night,
November the 2nd, 1898.

23:08.220 --> 23:10.087
Mrs. R.L. Strider

23:10.089 --> 23:11.955
is about to retire
for the night.

23:11.957 --> 23:15.058
She notices someone
underneath her bed.

23:15.060 --> 23:19.029
She screams, and her screaming
gets to the attention

23:19.031 --> 23:21.498
of her husband,
Mr. R.L. Strider,

23:21.500 --> 23:24.235
who just happens to be
the Justice of the Peace.

23:24.237 --> 23:26.770
Okay, so he's
the local judge in town.
Yes.

23:26.772 --> 23:30.474
Mr. R.L. Strider rushes into
the room and fires two shots

23:30.476 --> 23:32.142
and misses the person.

23:32.144 --> 23:34.178
He goes out and rouses

23:34.180 --> 23:36.513
all of these whites
in the neighborhood.

23:36.515 --> 23:40.751
They form a little posse to
go out and find somebody black.

23:40.753 --> 23:42.653
Okay, so the wife must
have said it was a black guy.

23:42.655 --> 23:45.589
She did, so they just find
the first black guy,

23:45.591 --> 23:47.657
who happens to be
John Williams,

23:47.659 --> 23:50.460
and he becomes the culprit
because of his color.

23:50.462 --> 23:52.997
- This is mind-boggling.
- It really is.

23:52.999 --> 23:57.601
The next morning, Williams
is brought before R.L. Strider,

23:57.603 --> 23:59.236
who's
the Justice of the Peace,

23:59.238 --> 24:01.805
also the husband
of Mrs. R.L. Strider.

24:01.807 --> 24:04.841
There's no evidence at all that
this guy's even on the scene.

24:04.843 --> 24:07.410
He's brought before
the judge in town,

24:07.412 --> 24:10.047
and his wife is
the actual complainant.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.349
Yes.
How is that not
a conflict of interest?

24:12.351 --> 24:14.184
That's a major
conflict of interest.

24:14.186 --> 24:16.253
Okay, so I'm assuming
he's found guilty.

24:16.255 --> 24:18.689
He gets convicted swiftly.

24:18.691 --> 24:21.424
R.L. Strider turns him over
to the constable,

24:21.426 --> 24:22.927
who's Alexander McQueen.

24:22.929 --> 24:26.430
At the time,
McQueen owned a property

24:26.432 --> 24:27.931
that you're investigating.

24:27.933 --> 24:30.166
And McQueen is supposed
to transport him

24:30.168 --> 24:31.802
to the jail in Prattville.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.104
So McQueen has Williams
in custody at this point,

24:34.106 --> 24:35.639
and he's taking him
to jail in Prattville.

24:35.641 --> 24:37.308
But I know he never makes it.
So what happened?

24:37.310 --> 24:43.580
Well, in route to Prattville,
McQueen is overtaken by a mob.

24:43.582 --> 24:45.449
They find the nearest tree

24:45.451 --> 24:48.986
and decide they would have
a lynching party.

24:48.988 --> 24:53.090
In the process,
John Williams loses his life.

24:53.092 --> 24:55.259
Here's an article
about that lynching.

24:58.531 --> 25:00.864
Wow.
It sounds like the only guy

25:00.866 --> 25:02.132
that could have
stopped this lynching

25:02.134 --> 25:03.834
was the guy that owned
my client's property.

25:03.836 --> 25:05.469
Okay, is there a chance

25:05.471 --> 25:08.172
that McQueen went after
the lynch mob?

25:08.174 --> 25:10.874
No, he did not.
No charges were ever filed

25:10.876 --> 25:12.909
against any of
the parties involved.

25:12.911 --> 25:16.814
No one in the state
did anything to ensure

25:16.816 --> 25:20.551
that justice was given to
the family of John Williams.

25:24.957 --> 25:27.924
I'm seeing a male out here.

25:27.926 --> 25:29.460
Late teens, early 20s.

25:29.462 --> 25:31.929
It's nighttime, and he's...

25:31.931 --> 25:34.431
close to nude.

25:34.433 --> 25:35.900
And I'm being arrested.

25:35.902 --> 25:39.603
I'm handcuffed
and they're beating me.

25:39.605 --> 25:41.305
And then I black out.

25:41.307 --> 25:46.110
And then when I wake up,
I'm rolling down an embankment.

25:48.280 --> 25:50.014
His body is too broken

25:50.016 --> 25:52.582
and his hands were still tied.

25:52.584 --> 25:55.152
Not handcuffed. Now they're
tied behind his back.

25:55.154 --> 25:57.454
And he dies.

26:05.797 --> 26:08.532
I saw several horrifying
things during my walk,

26:08.534 --> 26:12.236
but the man with the tree limbs
has me very concerned.

26:12.238 --> 26:15.872
First, I'm going to have him
sketched as he appeared in life.

26:15.874 --> 26:20.878
He had a very square chin
and jawline.

26:20.880 --> 26:23.280
His face goes up
and it's pretty thin.

26:26.151 --> 26:28.953
His eyes were pretty large.

26:31.490 --> 26:35.492
Next, I descried him
attacking living people.

26:35.494 --> 26:38.395
In the bed
is a man and a woman.

26:40.699 --> 26:43.500
And in his hand, he's
holding tree branches,

26:43.502 --> 26:46.837
and then two of them
are going into her nose.

26:46.839 --> 26:49.239
The living guy,
he's paralyzed.

26:58.517 --> 27:00.384
Amy, is this what you saw?

27:00.386 --> 27:02.920
Yes, that's what I saw.

27:22.375 --> 27:25.242
Now that Amy and I have
completed our investigations,

27:25.244 --> 27:27.710
we're ready to reveal
our findings to each other

27:27.712 --> 27:30.114
and our clients
for the first time.

27:30.116 --> 27:33.016
Amy, I'd like you to meet
Kimberly and her husband Leo.

27:33.018 --> 27:37.521
They live here with
Kimberly's brother, Kenny,

27:37.523 --> 27:39.923
right here,
and her mother, Henrietta.

27:39.925 --> 27:41.458
Kimberly called us in

27:41.460 --> 27:43.260
because she doesn't think
it's safe for anyone to be here.

27:43.262 --> 27:44.694
As a matter of fact,

27:44.696 --> 27:47.998
she's convinced whatever is here
is trying to kill somebody.

27:48.000 --> 27:50.334
So now that Amy knows
who you guys are,

27:50.336 --> 27:52.169
I'll ask her to describe
her walk for us.

27:54.774 --> 27:57.875
When I got here,
I went into the kitchen

27:57.877 --> 28:03.379
and I saw something strange.

28:03.381 --> 28:07.684
I saw objects were
moving on their own,

28:07.686 --> 28:12.422
but the thing to note here is
that was not a dead person

28:12.424 --> 28:14.258
causing that.

28:14.260 --> 28:18.228
It was actually
a living female,

28:18.230 --> 28:22.832
and this person
has latent PK ability,

28:22.834 --> 28:26.103
which is the ability to affect
your surroundings

28:26.105 --> 28:28.304
without touching anything,

28:28.306 --> 28:31.441
but it's not something that's
done in a conscious way.

28:31.443 --> 28:35.612
It's brought on
by a stressful event.

28:35.614 --> 28:38.781
Kimberly's mom is actually in
the early stages of Alzheimer's.

28:38.783 --> 28:40.184
She's in stage one.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.619
Now she moved in
about a year ago.

28:42.621 --> 28:47.790
Things just got much worse,
to the point where we --

28:47.792 --> 28:52.596
I fear for her safety,
and all of us actually.

28:52.598 --> 28:56.266
I'm just stressed.
I can't sleep. I can't eat.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.301
It's been getting worse
for a year.

28:58.303 --> 29:00.003
So the stuff Amy's talking
about in the kitchen,

29:00.005 --> 29:01.405
where stuff goes
flying and falling,

29:01.407 --> 29:03.507
does that mean anything to you?

29:03.509 --> 29:04.874
Yes, it does.

29:04.876 --> 29:08.244
We've had refrigerator magnets
fly off the refrigerator.

29:08.246 --> 29:10.079
So, I mean, do you think
it's Kimberly or her mom

29:10.081 --> 29:11.448
that's got the PK ability?

29:11.450 --> 29:13.517
I think it's Kimberly.

29:18.557 --> 29:21.692
<i>So</i> then I'm going down
the stairs

29:21.694 --> 29:26.296
and I see this dead guy,
and he was on the older side.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.898
This person was not good.

29:27.900 --> 29:31.000
He feels like living people
are invading his space.

29:31.002 --> 29:34.438
And I think that living people
who are exposed to him,

29:34.440 --> 29:35.572
one of the things --

29:35.574 --> 29:38.442
one of the traits
they would take on is anger.

29:38.444 --> 29:40.310
The other thing he does

29:40.312 --> 29:44.781
is that he will move things
downstairs often.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.349
Like, so you put
something down

29:46.351 --> 29:48.818
and then you'll find it
in some random location.

29:48.820 --> 29:51.087
We've had things move,
like cellphones,

29:51.089 --> 29:53.089
flashlights, car keys.

29:53.091 --> 29:55.325
- Books.
- House keys.

29:55.327 --> 29:57.527
The things
that concern me more

29:57.529 --> 30:01.798
is that he does drain
people's energy.

30:01.800 --> 30:05.802
<i>They walk in here with energy</i>
<i>and all of a sudden, it's gone.</i>

30:05.804 --> 30:09.406
<i>Their immune system</i>
<i>would get pretty run down.</i>

30:09.408 --> 30:11.307
<i>You know, they could develop,</i>
<i>like, bronchitis,</i>

30:11.309 --> 30:14.378
<i>pneumonias,</i>
<i>you know, things like that.</i>

30:14.380 --> 30:17.281
I kind of think I'm coming down
with something right now.

30:17.283 --> 30:18.414
Okay.

30:18.416 --> 30:20.951
I've had a cough
for a while now.

30:20.953 --> 30:24.287
He gets pneumonia every year.
So do I, like clockwork.

30:24.289 --> 30:26.757
That's really bad.

30:26.759 --> 30:29.159
Now are all of these experiences
from this old guy?

30:29.161 --> 30:33.029
Yeah, all of that is
due to him.

30:33.031 --> 30:34.564
- You believe me now?
- Yes.

30:34.566 --> 30:36.166
I tried to tell you.

30:40.873 --> 30:42.306
When I was in the backyard,

30:42.308 --> 30:47.143
there was a larger group
of deceased males.

30:47.145 --> 30:52.449
They seemed tribal.
They don't want you here.

30:52.451 --> 30:56.953
And they do everything they can
to try to fight the living.

30:56.955 --> 30:59.723
I saw them messing
with the cars out back.

30:59.725 --> 31:03.393
So I think maybe some
of your mechanical things

31:03.395 --> 31:05.228
would have issues.

31:05.230 --> 31:07.064
Kimberly runs
a transmission shop

31:07.066 --> 31:09.466
with her brother Kenny
right here on the property.

31:09.468 --> 31:11.334
Do me a favor.
Tell Amy what happened to Kenny

31:11.336 --> 31:13.403
when he was working on
the truck back there.

31:13.405 --> 31:17.274
Not just one battery exploded,
he had two explode.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.743
The odds of that are pretty,
you know, pretty out there.

31:19.745 --> 31:23.347
- Explode?
- Exploded.
Yeah, literally.

31:23.349 --> 31:25.115
That was the turning point
for him.

31:25.117 --> 31:26.683
That's when he said,
"I can't do this."

31:26.685 --> 31:30.487
It's a good thing he wasn't
near the hood because...

31:30.489 --> 31:32.456
Yes, he would have died.

31:32.458 --> 31:34.157
- Now, Leo, you told me...
- Wow.

31:34.159 --> 31:36.493
...about every damn thing
in the house not working.

31:36.495 --> 31:39.429
I've been through
three printers.

31:39.431 --> 31:42.566
I had a Shop-Vac
burned up last week.

31:42.568 --> 31:45.501
Three refrigerators.
Two sets of washers and dryers.

31:45.503 --> 31:49.172
I mean, they are actively
doing things to try to create

31:49.174 --> 31:51.341
as much bad luck as possible

31:51.343 --> 31:54.110
and trying
to get you to leave.

31:54.112 --> 31:57.714
It's working.

31:57.716 --> 31:59.449
And everything
they're doing, though,

31:59.451 --> 32:02.319
is to try to harm you
mentally, emotionally,

32:02.321 --> 32:05.021
and they will
go after you physically.

32:05.023 --> 32:07.257
You would feel stress, panic,

32:07.259 --> 32:10.260
fear in that your life
is in jeopardy.

32:10.262 --> 32:12.529
Now did you get anything
on these guys in life?

32:12.531 --> 32:14.998
Yes. There's a lot of them.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.700
I mean, I could only
figure out about 50,

32:17.702 --> 32:19.336
but I knew there was more.

32:19.338 --> 32:22.339
And they were dressed
extremely odd.

32:22.341 --> 32:25.909
I thought initially
Native American.

32:25.911 --> 32:27.878
So then I thought
maybe African.

32:27.880 --> 32:31.581
They're very protective
of the land.

32:31.583 --> 32:34.084
They're fighting
to protect it.

32:34.086 --> 32:35.685
Something I came across
in my research

32:35.687 --> 32:38.121
that might help make sense
of what you saw,

32:38.123 --> 32:39.656
which is this property

32:39.658 --> 32:42.426
used to be part of one of
the biggest slave plantations

32:42.428 --> 32:44.027
in the state of Alabama.

32:44.029 --> 32:47.331
The guy that owned this place
had over 155 slaves

32:47.333 --> 32:49.833
on the plantation.

32:49.835 --> 32:51.501
Obviously, the work conditions
were awful.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.470
There was mistreatment
and beatings.

32:53.472 --> 32:54.504
And when the Civil War hit,

32:54.506 --> 32:57.441
the guy that owned
all of these slaves

32:57.443 --> 32:59.709
actually cut their food rations

32:59.711 --> 33:02.445
because of the supply lines
being cut off.

33:02.447 --> 33:04.714
They were constantly fighting
for survival.

33:04.716 --> 33:06.783
I would have
never imagined this.

33:10.722 --> 33:12.822
Okay, anything else?

33:12.824 --> 33:15.258
So the next person
that I encountered

33:15.260 --> 33:19.896
is this very powerful
deceased male,

33:19.898 --> 33:21.331
and he concerns me a lot.

33:21.333 --> 33:26.936
This guy is wicked bad.

33:26.938 --> 33:28.538
He was very wealthy.

33:28.540 --> 33:31.074
I felt like he came from
old Southern money.

33:31.076 --> 33:35.011
He was a con man,
a liar, and a cheat.

33:35.013 --> 33:40.684
And he kept yelling about
collecting what was his.

33:40.686 --> 33:45.722
He made it clear that he owned
everybody here, living and dead.

33:45.724 --> 33:47.624
So the guy
that owned this place
when it was a plantation

33:47.626 --> 33:50.527
was a guy by the name
of Jabez Curry.

33:50.529 --> 33:53.730
Now you said the guy was
a real Southerner.

33:53.732 --> 33:56.099
This guy comes from Georgia
in 1823

33:56.101 --> 33:59.736
and he basically built
a cotton empire.

33:59.738 --> 34:04.174
He owned 2,800 acres,
including your property.

34:04.176 --> 34:07.243
And he owned it
for over 40 years.

34:07.245 --> 34:10.379
Now you said the guy
thinks he owns everybody

34:10.380 --> 34:11.815
and basically everything.
- Yes.

34:11.817 --> 34:18.020
Well, here's a list
of 155 slaves

34:18.022 --> 34:19.523
that this guy owned
on your property.

34:23.527 --> 34:24.659
Now you mentioned
the guy was a cheat.

34:24.661 --> 34:26.329
So after the Civil War ended,

34:26.331 --> 34:29.900
Curry wound up having to hire
his slaves as sharecroppers.

34:29.902 --> 34:31.868
They were basically
independent contractors for him,

34:31.870 --> 34:35.138
but all Curry cared about
was his own wealth

34:35.139 --> 34:37.741
and he basically
stiffed everybody

34:37.743 --> 34:39.809
when it came time to pay them.

34:39.811 --> 34:43.679
Curry died in 1871
at the age of 73.

34:43.681 --> 34:44.947
Now I don't have a picture
of what he looked like

34:44.949 --> 34:46.549
when he was young,

34:46.551 --> 34:49.152
but I got a portrait of him
later on.

34:52.291 --> 34:55.559
Now could Jabez Curry
be the guy you're talking about?

34:55.561 --> 34:58.895
I had a sketch done of
the individual that I saw.

35:07.039 --> 35:09.339
That nose is pretty prominent.

35:15.914 --> 35:18.315
Makes me nauseous.

35:18.317 --> 35:21.785
Definitely the same person at
different times in their life.

35:24.189 --> 35:25.955
Looks like
the same person to me.

35:25.957 --> 35:27.390
Do you think
it's the same guy?

35:27.392 --> 35:28.592
Yes.

35:31.263 --> 35:34.130
So what kind of experiences
would they have with this guy?

35:34.132 --> 35:36.867
He's very powerful.

35:36.869 --> 35:42.539
When I saw him initially, he had
these two dark shadows with him,

35:42.541 --> 35:44.641
and they looked like
tree limbs.

35:44.643 --> 35:48.078
But they're not a tree at all.
They're entities.

35:48.080 --> 35:50.746
And he's able to
control these things.

35:50.748 --> 35:52.282
And so I thought, you know,

35:52.284 --> 35:54.017
the living here
will see these things

35:54.019 --> 35:57.520
out of the corner
of their eyes constantly.

35:57.522 --> 35:59.455
Leo, you mentioned the shadows
that you see all the time.

35:59.457 --> 36:01.358
- Yes.
- Tell Amy about that.

36:01.360 --> 36:02.759
I would walk down the hallway

36:02.761 --> 36:05.228
and I would see it
out of the corner of my eye,

36:05.230 --> 36:08.031
either in one corner
or down the stairs.

36:08.033 --> 36:12.936
He utilizes these entities to
basically torture living people

36:12.938 --> 36:14.905
and get what he's after.

36:14.907 --> 36:18.641
What I saw was him messing with
both of the living people

36:18.643 --> 36:21.811
in the master bedroom.

36:21.813 --> 36:24.914
The tree limbs cause
a state of paralysis

36:24.916 --> 36:28.652
so that you wouldn't
be able to move.

36:28.654 --> 36:31.588
He's got them so they're
going up your nose,

36:31.590 --> 36:33.657
into your throat,
down into your body,

36:33.659 --> 36:37.460
and this negative energy
is affecting your organs.

36:37.462 --> 36:40.396
Upon waking or later on,

36:40.398 --> 36:44.734
you would feel sick
from the experience.

36:44.736 --> 36:47.637
Well, you can obviously see
how upset Kimberly is.

36:47.639 --> 36:48.805
Couple of things
you talked about

36:48.807 --> 36:51.240
actually affected her directly.

36:51.242 --> 36:54.143
I have nightmares, but I can't
remember the nightmares.

36:54.145 --> 36:56.146
Whenever I wake up,
I have trouble breathing

36:56.148 --> 36:59.215
and it feels like
a weight on my chest,

36:59.217 --> 37:02.619
and heart palpitations.

37:02.621 --> 37:04.420
Okay.

37:04.422 --> 37:07.490
She's also felt like
something held her down in bed.

37:07.492 --> 37:10.259
Something was holding
my legs down, painfully.

37:10.261 --> 37:13.029
And then Leo switched
the light on,

37:13.031 --> 37:15.031
and when he switched
the light on, it releases.

37:15.033 --> 37:18.635
Okay.
He's always in the shadows.

37:18.637 --> 37:21.103
I had a sketch done
of what I saw happening

37:21.105 --> 37:22.639
in the master bedroom.

37:40.058 --> 37:42.926
This is the stuff
of my nightmares.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.694
I feel like I'm in danger.

37:48.800 --> 37:50.600
Some nights I feel like,
when I go to sleep here,

37:50.602 --> 37:52.035
I won't wake up.

37:54.172 --> 37:57.373
He poses a very serious threat
to your health.

37:57.375 --> 37:59.476
Specifically
over the long-term,

37:59.478 --> 38:00.943
this could cause
serious illness,

38:00.945 --> 38:02.445
things like gallstones,

38:02.447 --> 38:04.547
bladder stones,
kidney infections,

38:04.549 --> 38:08.284
and then going into
possible cancers.

38:08.286 --> 38:11.187
He wants to kill
everybody in the house

38:11.189 --> 38:14.157
and make them,
you know, his slaves.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.262
Right now,
he's focused on you.

38:21.399 --> 38:24.567
I'm just so worn out
and tired from all of it.

38:24.569 --> 38:27.770
And maybe that's his plan --
wear you down,

38:27.772 --> 38:29.472
make you sick, kill you.
- Yeah.

38:29.474 --> 38:33.643
It's so far above anything
I could have ever thought.

38:33.645 --> 38:36.613
I'm terrified for her.

38:36.615 --> 38:38.181
And who's to say
that this guy's not gonna

38:38.183 --> 38:40.583
go after your mother next?

38:40.585 --> 38:44.220
I mean, she's depending on me.
She's helpless.

38:44.222 --> 38:47.590
It's something I can't
protect her from.

38:47.592 --> 38:49.926
I just don't want anything
to happen to my mother.

39:06.294 --> 39:08.194
Kimberly, I'm really glad
I took this case

39:08.196 --> 39:10.497
'cause after listening
to what Amy had to say,

39:10.499 --> 39:13.500
it's clear nobody is safe
in this house.

39:13.502 --> 39:16.169
Now it's time to find out if you
can do anything to fight back

39:16.171 --> 39:18.138
and protect your family.

39:18.140 --> 39:19.705
Now for that, I'm gonna
turn it over to Amy.

39:23.578 --> 39:26.011
I feel like
you could stay here,

39:26.013 --> 39:29.849
but it's going to take
a lot of work.

39:29.851 --> 39:32.085
First, you need to move on
the group of dead men

39:32.087 --> 39:33.586
in the backyard.

39:33.588 --> 39:36.222
What I would like
to have happen

39:36.224 --> 39:40.293
is for you to have
a hoodoo practitioner come out

39:40.295 --> 39:43.563
and do the guided
death process with them

39:43.565 --> 39:46.299
and then to assist them
to move on.

39:46.301 --> 39:50.903
And the hoodoo practitioner
that you hire

39:50.905 --> 39:55.608
needs to have
African ancestors.

39:55.610 --> 39:59.478
So let's give them a proper,
peaceful death passage...

39:59.480 --> 40:00.580
Definitely.

40:00.582 --> 40:04.017
...by someone that respects
them and they respect.

40:04.019 --> 40:05.818
Okay.

40:05.820 --> 40:09.155
The second thing is
the slave owner, Jabez.

40:09.157 --> 40:14.593
For him, I would like you to
have a voodoo priest come.

40:14.595 --> 40:20.233
They'll be able to confront him
and banish him from here.

40:20.235 --> 40:23.069
Then that same individual
can easily deal with

40:23.071 --> 40:26.706
the old guy in the basement.

40:26.708 --> 40:28.441
All right, what about
Kimberly's abilities?

40:28.443 --> 40:30.910
Anything she should do
about that?

40:30.912 --> 40:33.646
For you,
to deal with your stress,

40:33.648 --> 40:36.416
I want you to take
30 minutes a day

40:36.418 --> 40:38.985
and I want you
to practice tai chi,

40:38.987 --> 40:41.654
'cause that's gonna help you
to align your chakras.

40:41.656 --> 40:45.057
It's gonna help you
balance out that energy.

40:45.059 --> 40:46.792
You know, Amy,
one other thing.

40:46.794 --> 40:48.661
Kimberly was worried
her dead grandfather

40:48.663 --> 40:51.598
had cursed the house.
Did you get anything on that?

40:51.600 --> 40:55.635
No, I think he's moved on.

40:55.637 --> 40:58.404
So if Kimberly
does all this stuff,

40:58.406 --> 41:00.306
will it be safe
for her mom to stay here?

41:00.308 --> 41:02.275
Yes.

41:03.645 --> 41:06.445
It's what we want.
That's what we need.

41:06.447 --> 41:08.948
It's a lot of work,
but I've seen a lot worse.

41:08.950 --> 41:11.283
So I'm gonna ask you, Kimberly.
you gonna take Amy's advice?

41:11.285 --> 41:14.453
I'm gonna do
exactly what Amy says.

41:14.455 --> 41:15.755
We can do this.

41:15.757 --> 41:17.423
- Leo?
- Yes, definitely.

41:17.425 --> 41:19.359
I've gotta have her safe.

41:19.361 --> 41:23.229
It's a lot to digest,
but this gives us a lot of hope

41:23.231 --> 41:25.631
there's light at the end
of the tunnel.

41:25.633 --> 41:27.634
Thank you both very much.

41:30.338 --> 41:32.972
I hope Kimberly finds
a hoodoo practitioner

41:32.974 --> 41:35.174
to move on the dead
in the backyard,

41:35.176 --> 41:37.777
and a voodoo priest
to banish the slave owner

41:37.779 --> 41:39.579
and the old man in the basement.

41:39.581 --> 41:42.448
If she does that
and practices tai chi,

41:42.450 --> 41:43.983
she can balance her energy

41:43.985 --> 41:46.386
and lead a safe
and peaceful life.
