00:08.467 --> 00:12.095

00:08.467 --> 00:12.095
AS LONG AS YOU DON'T

00:08.467 --> 00:12.095
ABANDON IT MIDPROJECT.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.515

MAKE-YOUR-OWN

00:12.137 --> 00:14.515
SEASHELL CANDLES.

00:14.556 --> 00:18.268
OH. NOT FAIR.

00:14.556 --> 00:18.268
THE PLACED SMELLED LIKE MELTED

00:14.556 --> 00:18.268
CRAYONS FOR THREE WEEKS.

00:18.310 --> 00:19.436
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

00:19.478 --> 00:22.147
FINE.

00:19.478 --> 00:22.147
WHAT'S THE PROJECT?

00:22.189 --> 00:25.985
THIS IS A PILE OF

00:22.189 --> 00:25.985
EVERY CATALOG WE'VE RECEIVED

00:22.189 --> 00:25.985
FOR THE LAST THREE MONTHS.

00:26.025 --> 00:28.028
OKAY.

00:26.025 --> 00:28.028
I'VE GATHERED THEM ALL TOGETHER,

00:28.069 --> 00:30.614
AND I WILL NOW PROCEED TO CALL

00:28.069 --> 00:30.614
ALL THE COMPANIES

00:30.656 --> 00:33.158
THAT ARE SENDING US DUPLICATES

00:30.656 --> 00:33.158
AND TELL THEM TO STOP.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.996
THAT'S VERY ENVIRONMENTAL.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.996
IT'S GETTING RIDICULOUS.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.996
WE GET EIGHT OF SOME OF THESE.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.789
YOU'RE KIDDING.

00:37.037 --> 00:38.789
CHECK THIS OUT.

00:38.831 --> 00:41.166
THIS IS A STACK

00:38.831 --> 00:41.166
OF IDENTICAL CATALOGS

00:41.208 --> 00:45.004
MAILED TO LORELAI GILMORE,

00:41.208 --> 00:45.004
RORY GILMORE,

00:41.208 --> 00:45.004
LORELAI RORY GILMORE,

00:45.044 --> 00:47.339
LORELAI V. GILMORE,

00:45.044 --> 00:47.339

00:47.381 --> 00:49.758
LORELAI GILMO, LORELAI GIL,

00:49.800 --> 00:51.844
AND SQUEEGY BECKINHEIM.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.844
HOW'D THAT GET IN THERE?

00:51.886 --> 00:54.137
I TOLD A STORE MY NAME

00:51.886 --> 00:54.137
WAS SQUEEGY BECKINHEIM

00:54.179 --> 00:56.932
TO SEE HOW MANY CATALOGS

00:54.179 --> 00:56.932
THEY WOULD SELL MY NAME TO.

00:56.974 --> 00:58.559
MY NAME IS

00:56.974 --> 00:58.559
TO CATALOG COMPANIES

00:58.600 --> 01:00.644
WHAT BROOKE SHIELDS' PICTURE

00:58.600 --> 01:00.644
IS TO CHINESE RESTAURANTS.

01:00.686 --> 01:01.812
HOW MANY?

01:00.686 --> 01:01.812
TEN.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.230
WOW.

01:01.854 --> 01:03.230
INCLUDING ONE WE WERE

01:03.271 --> 01:04.899
ALREADY GETTING

01:03.271 --> 01:04.899
7 CATALOGS FROM.

01:04.940 --> 01:07.568
SO YOU MADE

01:04.940 --> 01:07.568
THE PROBLEM WORSE.

01:04.940 --> 01:07.568
UNINTENTIONALLY.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.988
THIS ONE IS ADDRESSED TO

01:07.609 --> 01:10.988
TOOKIE CLOTHESPIN.

01:07.609 --> 01:10.988
I FORGOT MY CODE NAME

01:11.030 --> 01:14.324
AT THE SECOND STORE I TESTED,

01:11.030 --> 01:14.324
SO I SAID IT WAS

01:11.030 --> 01:14.324
TOOKIE CLOTHESPIN.

01:14.366 --> 01:17.160
WHICH MEANS WE GET

01:14.366 --> 01:17.160
EVEN MORE CATALOGS.

01:14.366 --> 01:17.160
AGAIN, IT WAS UNINTENTIONAL.

01:17.202 --> 01:19.496
WHEN YOU START A FOREST FIRE

01:17.202 --> 01:19.496
UNINTENTIONALLY,

01:19.538 --> 01:21.623
IT'S STILL YOUR FAULT.

01:19.538 --> 01:21.623
YOU'RE PUTTING CALLING MYSELF

01:21.665 --> 01:23.208
SQUEEGY BECKINHEIM

01:21.665 --> 01:23.208
AND TOOKIE CLOTHESPIN

01:23.250 --> 01:25.252
ON A LEVEL WITH STARTING

01:23.250 --> 01:25.252
A FOREST FIRE?

01:25.293 --> 01:27.796
IT'S KILLING TREES.

01:25.293 --> 01:27.796
YOU'RE DEPRESSING ME.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.257
STOP THE MADNESS.

01:27.838 --> 01:30.257
THAT'LL CHEER YOU UP.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.259
I NEED COFFEE.

01:30.298 --> 01:32.259
THERE'S MORE COFFEE.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.844
I SHOULD GET READY, TOO.

01:33.886 --> 01:35.637
YOU'RE STOPPING MIDPROJECT.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.556
I'M BORED.

01:35.679 --> 01:37.556
THEN DON'T START

01:35.679 --> 01:37.556
THESE PROJECTS.

01:37.598 --> 01:40.099
I'LL FINISH. I JUST WANT TO

01:37.598 --> 01:40.099
CHECK ON THE SEASHELLS.

01:40.141 --> 01:41.977
THESE CATALOGS WILL BE

01:40.141 --> 01:41.977
SITTING HERE FOREVER.

01:42.019 --> 01:44.103
NO, THEY'RE BIODEGRADABLE.

01:44.145 --> 01:46.189
I'LL CALL HALF,

01:44.145 --> 01:46.189
AND YOU CALL HALF.

01:46.231 --> 01:48.567
OKAY.

01:48.609 --> 01:50.611
YOU DO YOURS FIRST,

01:48.609 --> 01:50.611
THEN I'LL DO MINE.

01:50.652 --> 01:52.153
HEY...

01:50.652 --> 01:52.153

THE BOTTOM LINE IS

THAT TOO MANY BIRDS

02:55.592 --> 02:57.136
ARE LANDING ATOP

02:55.592 --> 02:57.136
THE STREETLIGHTS

02:57.176 --> 02:59.638
AND RELIEVING THEMSELVES ON

02:57.176 --> 02:59.638
HELPLESS PASSERSBY.

02:59.680 --> 03:03.142
SOME OF THESE BIRDS SEEM TO BE

02:59.680 --> 03:03.142
DOING IT ON PURPOSE.

03:03.182 --> 03:05.769
YOU GET DUMPED ON,

03:03.182 --> 03:05.769
TAYLOR?

03:03.182 --> 03:05.769
IT'S NOT JUST ME.

03:05.811 --> 03:09.773
IF ANYBODY HAS A PICTURE

03:05.811 --> 03:09.773
OF TAYLOR GETTING DUMPED ON,

03:05.811 --> 03:09.773
I'LL PAY TOP DOLLAR.

03:09.815 --> 03:12.651
TAYLOR, ALL ANIMALS

03:09.815 --> 03:12.651
HAVE TO...YOU KNOW.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.945
HOW ARE YOU GONNA STOP BIRDS

03:12.693 --> 03:14.945
FROM DOING THAT?

03:14.987 --> 03:18.365
EASY. YOU PUT SHARP METAL SPIKES

03:14.987 --> 03:18.365
ON THE TOP OF THE FIXTURES.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.408
THEN, WHEN THEY LAND, POW!

03:18.406 --> 03:20.408
THEY'RE SHISH KEBOB.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.536
THAT'S CRUEL.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.536
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

03:22.577 --> 03:24.579
I'D RATHER HAVE BIRD

03:22.577 --> 03:24.579
CRAP ON MY HEAD.

03:24.621 --> 03:26.623
THERE --

03:24.621 --> 03:26.623
OUR NEW TOWN SLOGAN!

03:24.621 --> 03:26.623
I LIKE IT.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.000
I SEE COFFEE MUGS,

03:26.665 --> 03:28.000
T-SHIRTS.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.960
DON'T FORGET THE STUFFED

03:28.042 --> 03:29.960
SHISH-KEBOB BIRDS.

03:30.002 --> 03:32.838
THAT MOAN WHEN

03:30.002 --> 03:32.838
YOU SQUEEZE THEM.

03:32.880 --> 03:34.339
[ Spanish accent ]

03:32.880 --> 03:34.339
UH, EXCUSE ME.

03:34.381 --> 03:37.092
MAY I HELP YOU, SIR?

03:34.381 --> 03:37.092
YES, I WAS LOOKING FOR --

03:37.134 --> 03:39.678
AH, THERE SHE IS -- PATRICIA.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.513
[ Spanish accent ] PATRICIA!

03:39.720 --> 03:41.513
WELL, WELL, WELL!

03:41.555 --> 03:43.306
OOOH!      OOOH!

03:41.555 --> 03:43.306
OOOH!                      OOOH!

03:43.348 --> 03:45.225
OH, NOW, STOP IT.

03:43.348 --> 03:45.225
ARE YOU READY?

03:45.266 --> 03:47.268
I'M RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE

03:45.266 --> 03:47.268
OF SOMETHING, JESUS,

03:47.310 --> 03:49.396
BUT I'LL BE RIGHT OUT --

03:47.310 --> 03:49.396
PATIENCE.

03:49.437 --> 03:51.690
OKAY.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.192
NOW, AS WE WERE SAYING --

03:53.233 --> 03:55.694
WHO'S THE FOX, PATTY?

03:53.233 --> 03:55.694
EXCUSE ME...

03:55.736 --> 03:59.698
I MET HIM AT A FUNERAL.

03:55.736 --> 03:59.698
GREAT GUY, GOOD DANCER -- LATIN!

03:59.740 --> 04:00.866
OOOH!      OOOH!

03:59.740 --> 04:00.866
OOOH!                      OOOH!

04:00.908 --> 04:02.743
PEOPLE, ORDER, PLEASE!

04:02.784 --> 04:04.327
HE BETTER TREAT YOU RIGHT.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.914
HOW WELL DO YOU KNOW HIM?

04:04.369 --> 04:06.914
I JUST MET HIM.

04:06.955 --> 04:11.043
I CAN LOOK HIM UP

04:06.955 --> 04:11.043
ON THE INTERNET.

04:06.955 --> 04:11.043
PEOPLE, PLEASE!

04:11.085 --> 04:13.212
NOW, DUE TO THE LACK

04:11.085 --> 04:13.212
OF RESPONSE,

04:13.253 --> 04:15.214
WE'LL HOLD OFF

04:13.253 --> 04:15.214
ON THE BIRD SPIKES.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.007
GOOD.

04:15.255 --> 04:17.007
LET MISS PATTY'S DATE BEGIN!

04:20.010 --> 04:22.804
IT'S A DIGITAL.

04:20.010 --> 04:22.804
I WANT A FULL VISUAL ACCOUNT.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.099
Taylor: HOLD IT.

04:22.846 --> 04:25.099
THERE'S ONE MORE ISSUE

04:25.140 --> 04:27.101
THAT MUST BE ADDRESSED

04:25.140 --> 04:27.101
BEFORE WE CAN ADJOURN.

04:28.643 --> 04:31.312
ALRIGHT. NOW, THAT WEIRD,

04:28.643 --> 04:31.312
TACITURN FELLOW

04:31.354 --> 04:33.815
WHO'S ALWAYS WALKING AROUND

04:31.354 --> 04:33.815
WITH HIS BACKPACK

04:33.857 --> 04:35.901
HAS PUT IN AN ABSURD REQUEST

04:35.943 --> 04:38.653
TO STAGE A PROTEST

04:35.943 --> 04:38.653
IN THE TOWN SQUARE.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.948
THE TOWN LONER?

04:38.695 --> 04:40.948
THAT GUY STILL LIVES

04:38.695 --> 04:40.948
AROUND HERE?

04:40.989 --> 04:43.491
SOMEWHERE IN THE HILLS, RIGHT?

04:40.989 --> 04:43.491
THOUGHT HE WAS LONG GONE.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.036
HE VISITED THE BOOKSTORE A FEW

04:43.533 --> 04:46.036
TIMES AND SAID NOTHING.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.913
IT'S A BIT CREEPY.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.913
<i>VERY</i> CREEPY.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.999
BUT HE'S OUR BOO RADLEY,

04:47.955 --> 04:50.999
AND WE DON'T HAVE A BOO RADLEY.

04:51.041 --> 04:54.253
UNLESS YOU COUNT THE

04:51.041 --> 04:54.253
TROUBADOUR OR THE GUY

04:51.041 --> 04:54.253
WHO TALKS TO MAILBOXES.

04:54.294 --> 04:57.297
EVERY TOWN NEEDS AS MANY

04:54.294 --> 04:57.297
BOO RADLEYS AS THEY CAN GET.

04:57.338 --> 04:58.757
YES, THAT'S MY POINT.

04:58.799 --> 05:00.383
WHAT'S HE PROTESTING,

04:58.799 --> 05:00.383
TAYLOR?

05:00.425 --> 05:02.844
WELL, THAT'S NOT INDICATED

05:00.425 --> 05:02.844
HERE, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER.

05:02.886 --> 05:06.598
PROTESTING IS NOT ALLOWED IN

05:02.886 --> 05:06.598
THE TOWN SQUARE. PERIOD.

05:02.886 --> 05:06.598
IT'S UN-AMERICAN.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.268
LIKE THE REVOLUTIONARY WAR?

05:06.640 --> 05:09.268
AND ROSA PARKS?

05:09.309 --> 05:12.062
THAT'S DIFFERENT. THEY WERE

05:09.309 --> 05:12.062
AGAINST THE BRITISH AND BUSES.

05:12.104 --> 05:15.690
NO ONE LIKES THE BRITISH

05:12.104 --> 05:15.690
<i>OR</i> BUSES.

05:15.732 --> 05:17.025
YES, DEAR. WHAT IS IT?

05:17.067 --> 05:19.319
OH, I'M SORRY.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.319
I THOUGHT I HEARD MY NAME.

05:19.360 --> 05:21.196
HE SAID "BUSES," DEAR,

05:19.360 --> 05:21.196
NOT "JESUS."

05:21.238 --> 05:22.363
SOUNDED LIKE "JESUS."

05:23.907 --> 05:26.034
COULD THIS MEETING

05:23.907 --> 05:26.034
BE ANY MORE DISRUPTED?

05:26.076 --> 05:29.621
I COULD DO A SOFT-SHOE.

05:26.076 --> 05:29.621
WHILE I POUND OUT

05:26.076 --> 05:29.621
A BEAT ON THE BONGOS.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.915
SOUNDS LIKE FUN.

05:29.663 --> 05:31.915
I GOT BONGOS IN THE BACK.

05:31.957 --> 05:35.335
SEEING AS HOW OUR ATTENTION

05:31.957 --> 05:35.335
SPANS ARE GNATLIKE TONIGHT,

05:35.376 --> 05:40.090
AS TOWN SELECTMAN,

05:35.376 --> 05:40.090
I AM REFUSING THE TOWN LONER'S

05:35.376 --> 05:40.090
REQUEST TO PROTEST,

05:40.132 --> 05:42.134
AND I AM ADJOURNING

05:40.132 --> 05:42.134
THIS MEETING.

05:42.176 --> 05:44.803
SHE'S ALL YOURS, JESUS.

05:44.845 --> 05:46.596
NOTHING OF SUBSTANCE

05:44.845 --> 05:46.596
DONE IN THIS MEETING.

05:46.638 --> 05:47.681
AND THE TRADITION STANDS.

WHAT DO YOU KNOW

05:49.474 --> 05:51.685

05:51.726 --> 05:54.229
JUST KIND OF SKULKS AROUND WITH

05:51.726 --> 05:54.229

06:10.704 --> 06:12.331
OKAY. I'LL CATCH UP

DID YOU?

06:19.587 --> 06:22.090
NOT IN THE LEAST.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.884
WAY TO HAVE A HANDLE

06:22.132 --> 06:23.884
ON THINGS.

06:23.925 --> 06:26.678
HE DOESN'T SHARE MUCH WITH ME,

06:23.925 --> 06:26.678
AND HE'S GOT A LICENSE.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.223
STOP HIM BEFORE HE KILLS.

06:26.720 --> 06:29.223
HE'S NOT GONNA KILL ANYONE.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.766
HE'S GOT A BAD TRACK RECORD

06:29.264 --> 06:31.766
WITH CARS.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.766
I KNOW.

06:31.808 --> 06:33.310
I'M NOT EXACTLY THRILLED

06:31.808 --> 06:33.310

06:39.941 --> 06:42.694
<i>I</i> CAN BARELY AFFORD A CAR

06:39.941 --> 06:42.694

06:42.736 --> 06:45.488
PROBABLY A GIFT FROM SOMEONE WHO

06:42.736 --> 06:45.488

06:45.530 --> 06:47.324

07:02.672 --> 07:05.926
SO, UH, WHERE'D YOU GET

07:02.672 --> 07:05.926
THE MONEY FOR IT?

07:05.967 --> 07:07.177
MUGGED AN OLD LADY.

07:07.219 --> 07:09.012
JESS...

07:07.219 --> 07:09.012
IT DIDN'T COST THAT MUCH.

07:09.054 --> 07:11.014
WHAT'S "NOT MUCH"?

07:09.054 --> 07:11.014
LESS THAN "A LOT."

07:11.056 --> 07:15.018
WHERE DID YOU GET THE MONEY?

07:11.056 --> 07:15.018
YOU KNOW THAT HASH

07:15.060 --> 07:19.439
YEAH, I KNOW YOU DO.

07:19.480 --> 07:22.567
I ALSO KNOW I DON'T PAY YOU

07:19.480 --> 07:22.567
ENOUGH TO BUY THE CAR.

07:22.609 --> 07:26.696
I SAVED UP AND BOUGHT

07:22.609 --> 07:26.696
THE CAR FROM GYPSY'S.

07:22.609 --> 07:26.696
SHE GAVE ME A GOOD DEAL.

07:26.738 --> 07:28.365
OKAY, SO YOU BOUGHT A CAR.

07:28.407 --> 07:31.201
NOW, THE PRICE OF THE CAR

07:28.407 --> 07:31.201
IS JUST ONE SMALL THING.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.203
IT'S JUST THE BEGINNING.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.203
OH, YEAH?

07:33.245 --> 07:35.247
DID YOU TAKE THE ADDITIONAL

07:41.128 --> 07:44.505

07:41.128 --> 07:44.505
THIS DIDN'T COME WITH

07:41.128 --> 07:44.505
A NEVER-EMPTYING MAGICAL TANK?

07:44.547 --> 07:46.925
JESS...

07:44.547 --> 07:46.925
I FACTORED THAT IN.

07:46.967 --> 07:51.263
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE REPAIRS.

07:46.967 --> 07:51.263
I CAN FIX MOST OF THEM MYSELF
