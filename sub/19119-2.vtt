00:00.834 --> 00:03.171
Previously on Outsiders...

00:03.204 --> 00:04.438
-He's awake!
-I ran?

00:04.472 --> 00:05.773
Like a bat out of hell, Wade.

00:05.806 --> 00:07.808
Wade Houghton,
meet Matt Meyers.

00:07.841 --> 00:10.278
Matt's our new
emergency manager, Wade.

00:10.311 --> 00:11.645
I can't take the oak right now.

00:11.679 --> 00:13.081
After what I don' to your Fa,

00:13.114 --> 00:14.782
you need to find
his corpse, Foster.

00:14.815 --> 00:17.151
Krake, I need the key
to the prison box.

00:17.185 --> 00:19.087
It's gone, the key.

00:24.592 --> 00:25.626
Are you forgiving him?

00:25.659 --> 00:27.161
Or are you thinking something

00:27.195 --> 00:28.562
more dire will be his fate?

00:32.200 --> 00:34.435
(train whistle blows)

00:34.468 --> 00:36.337
I'm ready now,
to take the oak.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.272
Just looking for somebody.
I'm looking for my Fa.

00:38.306 --> 00:40.208
If he's still alive, they'd
have taken him to the hospital.

00:40.241 --> 00:41.675
I'm headed that way
if you want a ride.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.311
You know you've got
a wild animal in your truck?

00:43.344 --> 00:45.113
(crowd shouting)

00:45.146 --> 00:47.448
Get down. Get down.
Hands behind your head.

00:47.481 --> 00:48.816
HOUGHTON:
You know who this is?

00:48.849 --> 00:50.218
Shot by Foster Farrell the VI.

00:50.251 --> 00:51.452
Telling me the truth?

00:51.485 --> 00:52.753
I've never told a lie
in all my life.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.222
FULTS:
So, we should release him then?

00:54.255 --> 00:55.289
We've got five guys out there

00:55.323 --> 00:57.258
waiting to kick his ass
the moment we let him go.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.426
We're keeping him here.

01:02.596 --> 01:04.298
HOBO GERRY:
Hey there, you.

01:04.332 --> 01:05.399
You hungry?

01:24.485 --> 01:27.421
(woman singing in Old Tongue)

01:56.684 --> 02:00.388
(country blues music plays)

02:00.421 --> 02:01.422
* The dawn is up

02:01.455 --> 02:04.358
* There's fire on the mountain

02:04.392 --> 02:08.396
* They'll have to answer
for their crooked claim *

02:08.429 --> 02:11.799
* The hollows
they'll surround them *

02:11.832 --> 02:14.435
* And they'll go running back

02:14.468 --> 02:17.571
* To the wretched realm
they came *

02:19.973 --> 02:21.275
* Nor will

02:21.309 --> 02:26.414
* The dogs of hell refrain

02:26.447 --> 02:32.253
* And the land will suffer
those who came *

03:00.781 --> 03:02.350
MEYERS:
In a nutshell,

03:02.383 --> 03:03.917
we want to let
this situation cool down.

03:03.951 --> 03:06.887
We want the law-abiding
people of Blackburg

03:06.920 --> 03:08.722
to feel safe in their beds
at night.

03:08.756 --> 03:11.892
So, no more Farrells coming
down here disturbing the peace,

03:11.925 --> 03:13.661
causing trouble, period.

03:13.694 --> 03:15.563
Right? Yeah?

03:15.596 --> 03:17.998
First off,
we block access to the town.

03:18.031 --> 03:21.235
I propose we close
the logging roads here and here.

03:21.269 --> 03:23.904
Roads we can't close,
we post guards.

03:23.937 --> 03:27.475
Posts will be here,
here and here,

03:27.508 --> 03:29.243
and we're also going to
fence off mountain trails

03:29.277 --> 03:30.578
we know the Farrells use.

03:30.611 --> 03:31.845
You're going
to block off the mountain?

03:31.879 --> 03:33.347
If we can, yes.

03:33.381 --> 03:35.015
WADE: I'm-I'm-I'm sorry,
I have a question.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.552
We have no money for a medical
clinic, but you got, like,

03:38.586 --> 03:40.988
a jillion dollars to spend
on a 20-mile fence

03:41.021 --> 03:42.623
around Shay Mountain?

03:42.656 --> 03:44.592
Why don't we sidebar that?
All right, Sheriff?

03:44.625 --> 03:46.760
We're also going to add an extra
layer of protection in town,

03:46.794 --> 03:48.762
post armed guards at places
the Farrells have raided.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.398
You-You know what?
This has got to be, like,

03:50.431 --> 03:52.700
the dumbest idea I've ever heard
in my entire life.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.034
You're talking
about armed guards,

03:54.067 --> 03:55.803
like, standing
around in Blackburg.

03:55.836 --> 03:57.638
It's going to make people
pretty nervous, don't you think?

03:57.671 --> 03:59.440
I don't think they'll
feel that way at all, Sheriff.

03:59.473 --> 04:01.742
I think they'll be tickled pink
we're making them feel safe.

04:01.775 --> 04:03.311
Well put, Ms. Grimes.

04:04.478 --> 04:05.546
I don't know who

04:05.579 --> 04:06.814
invited you here, anyway.

04:06.847 --> 04:08.482
Okay, I've requisitioned
some K-rails.

04:08.516 --> 04:11.018
We should have crews ready
to go as early as EOW.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.886
I tell you,
I am very happy

04:12.920 --> 04:15.456
to have an emergency manager
here in Blackburg.

04:15.489 --> 04:16.957
It is the best thing
that could have happened.

04:16.990 --> 04:18.792
And what do you have to say
about the fact

04:18.826 --> 04:20.294
that there's a Farrell
in custody

04:20.328 --> 04:22.563
as a suspect
in Breece Dobbs' shooting?

04:22.596 --> 04:23.997
He was a One Planet employee,
correct?

04:24.031 --> 04:26.534
Well, that's great news
for the One Planet family.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.770
Now we're all hoping to see
justice get done.

04:35.943 --> 04:37.845
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.480
Excuse me.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.856
I'm G'Winveer, the Bren'in.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.391
Who speaks for you?

04:58.366 --> 05:00.634
I do.

05:00.668 --> 05:04.572
I am Moregon,
and we are the Kinnah.

05:04.605 --> 05:07.341
We come from the shadow side
of this mountain.

05:07.375 --> 05:08.676
The water has gone dark,

05:08.709 --> 05:10.878
tainted by the lowlanders'
road building.

05:12.513 --> 05:13.981
We've been searching
for shelter.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.418
We beseech you.

05:17.451 --> 05:20.888
Grant us the welcome guaranteed
by the old law of Brehon...

05:20.921 --> 05:24.057
to rest
and to regain our strength.

05:25.593 --> 05:27.395
Our lives are in your hands.

05:32.400 --> 05:34.334
Torr thee sah-myrr o'Farrells?

05:37.571 --> 05:40.374
We will follow
your customs, yes.

05:42.910 --> 05:44.745
Fetch water for our guests.

05:57.891 --> 05:59.760
Let's let them be.
Go on now.

06:01.061 --> 06:02.496
Go on.

06:34.728 --> 06:36.196
COUSIN WILLEM:
There's no time for strangers.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.598
They're not strangers.

06:37.631 --> 06:38.832
-Huh?
-They're the Kinnah.

06:38.866 --> 06:40.634
-Kinnah?
-Aye.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.936
They were McGintucks once,
but they departed

06:42.970 --> 06:44.171
and formed their own clan.

06:44.204 --> 06:46.006
They left? How long ago?

06:46.039 --> 06:48.942
No one knows,
A hundred years, maybe more.

06:48.976 --> 06:50.143
Well, they don't belong here.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.479
Where's their men,
I'd like to ask?

06:51.512 --> 06:52.813
That's a good question.

06:52.846 --> 06:54.548
This is no time
for interlopers around here.

06:54.582 --> 06:55.916
Do y'all have no compassion?

06:57.184 --> 06:58.452
Are we no better

06:58.486 --> 06:59.587
than them down below?

06:59.620 --> 07:01.555
We live by letting live.

07:10.531 --> 07:12.733
(dog barking)

07:12.766 --> 07:14.668
MAN (distantly):
Hey, something smells good.

07:14.702 --> 07:16.637
-What's for dinner?
-WOMAN: Pot roast.

07:16.670 --> 07:20.140
Oh, you're awake.

07:20.173 --> 07:21.575
Where am I?

07:21.609 --> 07:22.843
You're in my house, darling.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.714
Found you
in the middle of the road.

07:26.747 --> 07:29.483
Looked like you was
a pile of old coonskins.

07:29.517 --> 07:31.051
I couldn't leave you there.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.020
Wouldn't be Christian.

07:33.053 --> 07:35.989
Oh, I ain't introduced myself.

07:38.692 --> 07:40.060
Name's Corinne.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.030
What's yourn?

07:43.063 --> 07:44.932
How long I been here?

07:44.965 --> 07:47.501
A day, two, maybe three.

07:47.535 --> 07:51.104
Oh, no, best we take
a look at you.

07:53.173 --> 07:57.511
Marlon, he's my eldest,
he tends the hogs,

07:57.545 --> 08:01.214
-so he did a real good job...
-Uh-huh.

08:01.248 --> 08:04.552
...getting that lead out you.

08:04.585 --> 08:08.221
He's a good boy,
not like this one here.

08:08.255 --> 08:10.658
No, that's not for you.

08:10.691 --> 08:12.593
That's for our guest.

08:12.626 --> 08:14.061
Now get.

08:15.729 --> 08:16.897
(Corinne sighs)

08:16.930 --> 08:18.198
(Corinne chuckles)

08:18.231 --> 08:21.301
Here now, you need
to get your strength up.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.537
Boomer stew, we call it.

08:23.571 --> 08:25.072
(chuckles)
It's real good.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.874
(Big Foster groans)

08:26.907 --> 08:30.644
I need to...
I need to get to my home.

08:30.678 --> 08:32.613
-No.
-(groans)

08:32.646 --> 08:35.949
You don't have
your strength up yet.

08:37.250 --> 08:40.688
I'll come back,
see when you's ready

08:40.721 --> 08:42.856
to put something
in your stomach.

08:42.890 --> 08:44.057
Oh no, wait, wait.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.993
Hey.

08:46.026 --> 08:47.160
No...

08:48.696 --> 08:51.565
No, no, now,
don't wile yourself.

08:51.599 --> 08:53.133
There's no place
for you to go

08:53.166 --> 08:55.202
and nothing
for you to do but rest.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.204
-No, but hey...
-We'll talk soon.

08:57.237 --> 08:59.206
No, hey, hey. Hey!

08:59.239 --> 09:01.141
(groans)

09:14.888 --> 09:17.324
Oh, no.

09:23.296 --> 09:24.297
FEMALE DETECTIVE (on monitor):
So, you shot him?

09:24.331 --> 09:25.699
How many times was it?

09:25.733 --> 09:27.067
Now, why aren't you
listening to me?

09:27.100 --> 09:28.936
I told you I didn't
shoot this man.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.237
Come on, Mr. Farrell.

09:30.270 --> 09:32.840
You know you did,
and we know you did,

09:32.873 --> 09:34.374
so just tell us
how it went down.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.676
I didn't shoot nobody.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.845
We already know what happened.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.680
Okay, you help yourself
if you talk to us.

09:39.713 --> 09:40.814
Tell us what you
did with the gun.

09:40.848 --> 09:42.215
-What gun?
-The one you used

09:42.249 --> 09:43.917
-to kill Breece Dobbs.
-I didn't have no gun.

09:43.951 --> 09:46.319
I did not even shoot that man.
I told you who did.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.822
You got scared,

09:48.856 --> 09:50.824
so you shot him.

09:50.858 --> 09:51.992
Okay, I get that.

09:52.025 --> 09:53.060
I might have done
the same thing.

09:53.093 --> 09:54.995
Well, good for you.

09:55.028 --> 09:56.697
I didn't shoot nobody.

09:56.730 --> 09:57.998
Where's Wade Houghton?

09:58.031 --> 09:59.700
FEMALE DETECTIVE:
He's not here right now.

09:59.733 --> 10:01.669
You're not helping us
to help you here, my friend.

10:01.702 --> 10:04.171
I know the judge
and he'll go easy on you,

10:04.204 --> 10:07.708
get you out of here,
but only if you help us.

10:07.741 --> 10:09.777
Is this what
y'all do all the time,

10:09.810 --> 10:11.144
just lock somebody in a room

10:11.178 --> 10:13.647
and don't listen
to a damn thing they say?

10:13.681 --> 10:15.248
Is that what happens down here?

10:18.752 --> 10:20.153
Take us through it again.

10:20.187 --> 10:22.622
(indistinct conversation)

10:25.225 --> 10:26.860
-We're getting there.
-Well, yeah.

10:26.894 --> 10:28.195
I didn't hear anything
to support the idea

10:28.228 --> 10:29.396
that he killed a person.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.732
It's a process.
Takes time, Sheriff.

10:31.765 --> 10:33.000
Yeah, we've got enough
to charge him.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.334
I'm sorry.
I mean, he's sitting there

10:34.367 --> 10:35.803
telling you
he didn't kill nobody.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.170
He ain't got a murder weapon.

10:37.204 --> 10:39.006
I mean, thank y'all very much
for coming down.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.708
I think myself and my men
will take it from here.

10:40.741 --> 10:43.811
Uh, the state police
have authority on this, Wade.

10:43.844 --> 10:45.178
-Excuse me?
-Yeah,

10:45.212 --> 10:47.080
the state's attorney
brought them in, okay?

10:47.114 --> 10:48.849
-Thank you so much.
-You bet.

10:48.882 --> 10:51.218
This, uh, goes a long way
to quelling people's fears.

10:51.251 --> 10:52.319
We'll see about
getting that on the docket

10:52.352 --> 10:53.386
for arraignment today.

10:53.420 --> 10:55.088
Great, nice work.
Thank you.

10:57.257 --> 10:59.126
And thank you, Wade.

10:59.159 --> 11:00.694
Thank you for getting
on board with this.

11:00.728 --> 11:02.095
I was worried
about this Dobbs thing,

11:02.129 --> 11:05.065
but this will be good for us,
and for you...

11:05.098 --> 11:07.467
your image, you know?

11:07.500 --> 11:10.070
Restore confidence...
you know what I mean?

11:18.178 --> 11:19.947
(knock on door)

11:19.980 --> 11:21.081
Come.

11:21.114 --> 11:22.883
You call for me, Bren'in?

11:22.916 --> 11:24.451
Hasil, yes.

11:25.953 --> 11:27.120
When them policemen
came up here,

11:27.154 --> 11:28.789
they took our peace of mind

11:28.822 --> 11:30.123
'cause we were unawares.

11:30.157 --> 11:31.391
That can't happen again.

11:31.424 --> 11:32.926
-I agree.
-Good.

11:32.960 --> 11:35.362
I've decided
that we need a patrol.

11:35.395 --> 11:37.064
We need eyes
all over this hill

11:37.097 --> 11:40.901
and I think you're the man
to be set to that task.

11:40.934 --> 11:44.071
Well, you know the ways
between our world and theirs,

11:44.104 --> 11:45.973
and you're strong
and you're loyal.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.240
Aren't you?

11:49.509 --> 11:52.112
Like I said, you ain't got
nothing to worry about.

11:52.145 --> 11:53.881
I'm here now.

11:53.914 --> 11:56.917
You, uh, you seen Lil Foster
on your travels by chance?

11:56.950 --> 11:58.185
I have not.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.454
Well, you do,
you tell him come see me.

12:01.488 --> 12:04.191
Yes, ma'am.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.258
(sighs)

12:05.292 --> 12:06.827
Bren'in?

12:06.860 --> 12:07.995
Yes?

12:09.196 --> 12:11.431
You trust them?

12:11.464 --> 12:13.300
Those Kinnah ladies?

12:13.333 --> 12:15.068
I mean, they say
they're starving and weak,

12:15.102 --> 12:17.470
but they don't seem
that way to me.

12:17.504 --> 12:19.106
They seem like
they just dressed up,

12:19.139 --> 12:20.507
playing some kind of game.

12:20.540 --> 12:22.275
(chuckles)

12:22.309 --> 12:24.511
They-They do have some strange
ways about them, it's true.

12:24.544 --> 12:26.513
No, I think they're fleecers,
flimflammers.

12:26.546 --> 12:27.815
I think they're bilking us.

12:27.848 --> 12:30.117
Hasil, this is our way.

12:30.150 --> 12:33.821
We give freely and we can't
afford more enemies.

12:33.854 --> 12:35.555
You know, you spent
too much time down there.

12:35.588 --> 12:40.460
All I'm saying is, what if
they're up to something else?

12:40.493 --> 12:44.798
I hear you,
but they speak our language.

12:44.832 --> 12:46.199
They're family.

12:50.237 --> 12:52.472
(Hasil sighs)

12:54.407 --> 12:56.109
Good day to you, Bren'in.

12:56.143 --> 12:57.577
How are the Kinnah settling in?

12:57.610 --> 12:59.479
Well.
We are grateful.

12:59.512 --> 13:01.214
We hope we won't be
a bother to you much longer.

13:01.248 --> 13:02.816
Oh, not a bother.
You need any help

13:02.850 --> 13:06.186
to situate yourself,
you just ask.

13:06.219 --> 13:08.455
You're generous and kind.

13:10.557 --> 13:12.893
A true leader.

13:12.926 --> 13:15.095
I admit when we arrived,
I was taken by

13:15.128 --> 13:17.530
how young thou were.

13:17.564 --> 13:19.967
Such a cub to be burdened
with this task.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.501
(G'Win chuckles)

13:21.534 --> 13:23.336
I hadn't thought of myself
as a cub in a long while,

13:23.370 --> 13:25.405
but... it's true.

13:25.438 --> 13:28.541
The Oak only passed
to me recently.

13:28.575 --> 13:30.243
All the more impressive
that it be so

13:30.277 --> 13:33.881
and yet you are so able.

13:33.914 --> 13:37.384
I saw you stand
to your dissenters.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.019
But you be fair
and you gave them an ear.

13:39.052 --> 13:40.387
(speaks Old Tongue)

13:40.420 --> 13:43.123
It's no small task to hold

13:43.156 --> 13:45.859
thy ground and not appear rigid.

13:45.893 --> 13:51.398
Questions only breed
more questions, like weeds.

13:51.431 --> 13:53.600
They can choke
the path you walk.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.238
Your people were
wise to choose thee.

13:58.271 --> 14:01.541
Once all the heads of
the mountain clans were women.

14:01.574 --> 14:03.576
The Bren'in handed
from mother to daughter

14:03.610 --> 14:06.046
in an unbroken line.

14:06.079 --> 14:08.348
We moved to the far side
of Shay Mountain

14:08.381 --> 14:11.985
where we could practice
our way in peace.

14:12.019 --> 14:13.420
Not much can grow there,
I've heard.

14:13.453 --> 14:15.989
It's a harsh way to live.

14:16.023 --> 14:18.225
It's also the right way.

14:18.258 --> 14:20.560
And as you see, we endured.

14:22.529 --> 14:25.665
So, you have no men among you?

14:25.698 --> 14:28.101
Men only cause pain...

14:28.135 --> 14:30.603
but I don't need
to tell thee that.

14:30.637 --> 14:32.639
Pardon?

14:32.672 --> 14:34.374
I can see it.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.043
Plain on thy face.

14:37.544 --> 14:40.047
You know well
the pain men bring.

14:44.117 --> 14:45.485
How do you maintain
your number then?

14:48.288 --> 14:53.526
When it's time for such things,
men are easy enough to come by.

14:53.560 --> 14:54.561
(chuckles)

15:02.235 --> 15:04.304
What are you doing here,
dumbass?

15:04.337 --> 15:06.173
You've got chores to do.
Get up there, go on!

15:06.206 --> 15:08.608
Hey... leave him be.

15:08.641 --> 15:11.511
(sighs)

15:11.544 --> 15:14.481
How you doing, big fella?

15:14.514 --> 15:16.249
You got your hunger up yet?

15:18.718 --> 15:19.953
Yeah?

15:23.723 --> 15:25.525
You need a little bit more care.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.200
Oh, there.

15:34.734 --> 15:38.471
Yeah, ain't that nice?

15:43.743 --> 15:46.313
Mm... that's pretty.

15:46.346 --> 15:49.149
Why you got me tied?

15:49.182 --> 15:54.988
Oh, you were thrashing from
the fevers, something fierce.

15:55.022 --> 15:57.190
I was afraid you were gonna...

15:57.224 --> 15:59.359
throw yourself
right out the bed.

16:03.330 --> 16:06.066
Hey, Lord, ain't you pretty.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.437
You're like socks on a rooster.

16:12.072 --> 16:15.342
Well, well,
I ain't got a fever no more...

16:15.375 --> 16:19.046
so... you can loose me now.

16:19.079 --> 16:21.548
Oh, shh...

16:21.581 --> 16:24.084
I know what you need.

16:24.117 --> 16:25.185
What?

16:25.218 --> 16:26.186
(moans)

16:27.820 --> 16:32.425
Yeah, you must be hungry
for something more than vittles.

16:32.459 --> 16:36.029
Oh... what are you...

16:36.063 --> 16:37.664
I got what you need.

16:37.697 --> 16:40.100
No, hey.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.101
Oh-ho.

16:41.134 --> 16:42.769
Look, uh...

16:42.802 --> 16:46.606
no, hey, hey, hey, no, no, no,
stop, stop, stop, okay? Okay?

16:46.639 --> 16:48.075
I'm a married man.

16:49.476 --> 16:51.644
Hell, I'm married...

16:51.678 --> 16:55.148
to a monster.

16:55.182 --> 16:57.484
-Now you need some
love and tender care. -No.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.419
-Mm-mm. Mm-mm.
-I know I do.

16:59.452 --> 17:01.388
(footsteps approaching)

17:02.522 --> 17:03.490
Where'd you put

17:03.523 --> 17:04.524
the goddamn remote?

17:04.557 --> 17:06.759
You probably sat on it.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.361
Did you check up your ass?

17:08.395 --> 17:10.097
It ain't up my ass, bitch.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.099
Get the hell out of here.

17:12.132 --> 17:14.834
(Big Foster groans)

17:14.867 --> 17:19.672
Relax now and let me
take care of you.

17:19.706 --> 17:20.673
(groans)

17:20.707 --> 17:24.611
Oh, see?

17:24.644 --> 17:27.414
You ain't even got the
proper strength to be a man.

17:27.447 --> 17:29.149
-No.
-Oh.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.783
Don't fret.

17:30.817 --> 17:35.455
I've got plenty experience
working with a wet noodle.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.424
(heavy breathing, moaning)

17:47.700 --> 17:50.437
All right,
we are commencing a scout.

17:50.470 --> 17:53.540
Now we can't get caught
like we was, not ever again.

17:54.674 --> 17:56.143
What I reckon is that

17:56.176 --> 17:57.744
they're already out there

17:57.777 --> 18:00.147
and they're out there watching.

18:00.180 --> 18:03.116
Each man's going to
survey a stretch of woods.

18:03.150 --> 18:04.417
Now we want to know
where they are

18:04.451 --> 18:06.186
without them knowing
nothing about us,

18:06.219 --> 18:09.222
so we are gonna go quiet.

18:09.256 --> 18:11.191
We walk, no bikes.

18:11.224 --> 18:13.293
Well, then...

18:13.326 --> 18:15.462
I mean, that's... that's
going to take all day on foot.

18:15.495 --> 18:18.531
No vehicles.
You understand me?

18:18.565 --> 18:20.800
Barnabis, I want you to take
the East Creek Falls.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.835
Enoch, I want you to get eyes
up on Badger Ridge.

18:22.869 --> 18:24.637
What about you?

18:24.671 --> 18:26.506
I'm going to make sure we're
all shored up over on the south

18:26.539 --> 18:27.874
down by The Drop.

18:27.907 --> 18:29.609
Y'all finished,
you come back to my place,

18:29.642 --> 18:32.345
you see me, tell me
what you seen. All right?

18:32.379 --> 18:34.347
-I got it.
-Good.

18:34.381 --> 18:35.782
Let's go.

18:37.750 --> 18:41.188
The Drop,
it's the barest road from here.

18:41.221 --> 18:43.523
Hell, he'll be back
before I've even gone halfway.

18:43.556 --> 18:44.824
Best get to it then.

18:44.857 --> 18:47.494
Oh, this is stupid.
I mean, he...

18:47.527 --> 18:48.928
he's been down in that town

18:48.961 --> 18:50.763
sniffing around
that Lostie girl so much,

18:50.797 --> 18:52.499
he don't even know
what's what.

18:52.532 --> 18:54.667
-What are you going to do?
-Well...

18:54.701 --> 18:56.703
sure as hell ain't
going to walk all that way.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.471
That's all I know.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.543
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

19:05.512 --> 19:06.846
I'll take you down
to the courthouse.

19:06.879 --> 19:08.281
You've got a hearing.

19:13.953 --> 19:14.921
-What's this?
-It's all right.

19:14.954 --> 19:16.323
They have to do it.

19:17.690 --> 19:18.925
Calm down,
it's all right.

19:18.958 --> 19:20.627
-What?
-It's all right. Come on.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.762
-Why don't you get away from me,
boy. -Hey, hey, hey!

19:22.795 --> 19:24.797
Back off now!
Hey! Back off!

19:24.831 --> 19:26.833
Hey, get back!
Put that away, right now!

19:26.866 --> 19:29.369
Hey, calm it down.
Hands off! Calm down.

19:29.402 --> 19:30.803
Stop, listen to me!
Look at me now!

19:30.837 --> 19:33.206
Don't worry about him, okay?

19:33.240 --> 19:35.575
Goddamn it, this ain't
about me or you anymore.

19:35.608 --> 19:36.876
This is about the law.

19:36.909 --> 19:38.845
Okay, you can get violent
if you want to,

19:38.878 --> 19:40.313
but if you strike an officer,
it's going to give them

19:40.347 --> 19:43.716
twice as many reasons
to hold you.

19:43.750 --> 19:46.453
You got to work with me.

19:46.486 --> 19:47.754
Give me your hands.

19:51.991 --> 19:53.593
Okay, you're gonna follow me.

19:55.528 --> 19:57.664
Thank you.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.268
This is the matter
of the Commonwealth of Kentucky

20:01.301 --> 20:03.603
v. Foster Farrell the VIII.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.605
-Is that correct?
-Yes, Your Honor.

20:05.638 --> 20:08.275
Jack Marsil
for the Commonwealth.

20:08.308 --> 20:10.277
Sophia Bennett
for the defense, Your Honor.

20:10.310 --> 20:11.511
And the charges are

20:11.544 --> 20:13.446
wanton endangerment
in the first,

20:13.480 --> 20:14.847
assault in the first,

20:14.881 --> 20:18.251
conspiracy to commit murder,
murder.

20:18.285 --> 20:20.487
-Is that correct, Mr. Marcel?
-Yes, Your Honor.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.889
How about it, Ms. Bennett?
How's your client plead?

20:22.922 --> 20:25.625
Get up.

20:25.658 --> 20:26.893
You want me to talk now?

20:26.926 --> 20:28.795
JUDGE:
Yes, Mr. Farrell, your plea.

20:28.828 --> 20:31.364
Well, like I told this one,
I didn't kill nobody.

20:31.398 --> 20:32.965
I didn't hurt nobody.
I come down here

20:32.999 --> 20:34.334
-to find the one who did.
-Mr. Farrell.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.735
You look like a reputable man.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.304
-Mr. Farrell.
-Hold on a second.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.772
-I-I was told that I...
-Mr. Farrell, sir.

20:39.806 --> 20:41.408
I'm not sure Ms. Bennett
explained to you

20:41.441 --> 20:43.510
-how all this works.
-I'm sorry, Your Honor.

20:43.543 --> 20:45.578
I literally got this case
five minutes ago.

20:45.612 --> 20:48.581
Mr. Farrell,
all I need from you

20:48.615 --> 20:50.283
is for you to tell me

20:50.317 --> 20:53.753
whether you are guilty
of the crimes mentioned or not.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.922
I didn't kill nobody.

20:55.955 --> 20:57.857
Never.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.292
So, that's not guilty,

20:59.326 --> 21:01.428
then that's what I am,
not guilty.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.430
Thank you.

21:03.463 --> 21:04.531
So entered.

21:05.732 --> 21:07.334
Now, to the matter of bail,

21:07.367 --> 21:08.768
Mr. Marsil.

21:08.801 --> 21:10.303
MARSIL:
The Commonwealth requests

21:10.337 --> 21:12.572
that the defendant
be held without bail.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.674
This man, he has
no ties to the community,

21:14.707 --> 21:16.776
he doesn't even have
a social security number.

21:16.809 --> 21:18.010
-I don't have what?
-Now you couple that

21:18.044 --> 21:19.812
with the fact
that he is a member

21:19.846 --> 21:22.682
of the infamous Farrell clan,
with intimate knowledge

21:22.715 --> 21:25.685
of mountain survival,
frankly, it's a, it's a miracle

21:25.718 --> 21:26.953
-we have him in custody at all.
-Shit.

21:26.986 --> 21:28.521
He is the very definition

21:28.555 --> 21:30.823
of a flight risk, Your Honor.

21:30.857 --> 21:34.427
All that is, strictly
speaking, true, Your Honor...

21:34.461 --> 21:37.464
but Mr. Farrell
has no prior criminal record

21:37.497 --> 21:39.098
and it does not appear
that the prosecution

21:39.131 --> 21:40.600
has given enough evidence
in order...

21:40.633 --> 21:42.635
I think I've heard enough,
Ms. Bennett.

21:45.705 --> 21:46.673
Bail is denied.

21:46.706 --> 21:47.840
(gavel bangs)

22:00.587 --> 22:02.389
(door opens and closes)

22:02.422 --> 22:03.990
HOUGHTON:
Hey, Ledda.

22:06.759 --> 22:09.962
Hey, let's go and fix
some lunch.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.764
I've been at court all morning,

22:11.798 --> 22:12.832
I ain't eaten, I'm starving.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.404
You have court for the Farrell
that you caught?

22:20.673 --> 22:21.808
Where'd you hear that?

22:22.875 --> 22:24.777
I got a call.

22:24.811 --> 22:26.746
They're saying
that he's the one who...

22:29.882 --> 22:33.152
Yeah, well,
don't get your hopes up.

22:33.185 --> 22:35.622
It ain't as cut and dried
as some folks might like.

22:35.655 --> 22:36.889
What do you mean?

22:36.923 --> 22:38.758
I mean, I don't think
he killed him.

22:38.791 --> 22:40.893
In fact, I know he didn't.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.929
You know, based on what?

22:42.962 --> 22:44.631
Based on he told me
and I believe him.

22:44.664 --> 22:46.599
(chuckles)

22:47.867 --> 22:51.504
I do not understand you, Wade.

22:51.538 --> 22:52.839
(laughing):
You are some kind of man.

22:52.872 --> 22:54.674
Listen, I know
you want to sort this out.

22:54.707 --> 22:57.577
No, you know jack and shit...

22:57.610 --> 22:59.612
-Hey.
-...and that is clear.

22:59.646 --> 23:03.450
I mean, you say that you want
to solve Breece's murder

23:03.483 --> 23:04.751
-and then it's right here...
-Listen....

23:04.784 --> 23:06.152
...falls right into your lap,

23:06.185 --> 23:07.654
and you say no?

23:07.687 --> 23:09.656
You just toss it out
in the garbage?

23:09.689 --> 23:10.890
Hey,
what are you talking about?

23:10.923 --> 23:12.859
There's not any evidence.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.661
All we know about this man
is he's a Farrell.

23:14.694 --> 23:16.028
What you want, to convict him
on the basis of that?

23:16.062 --> 23:17.997
I don't know
what to do with you.

23:18.030 --> 23:21.634
-I have fought for you,
for years. -Wait, wait.

23:21.668 --> 23:23.703
I have fought,
and you know what?

23:23.736 --> 23:25.137
Everyone's right.

23:25.171 --> 23:28.575
-You are scared of them,
plain and simple. -Wha...

23:28.608 --> 23:30.042
hey, wait a minute here.
What's this about?

23:30.076 --> 23:31.478
The other day you're saying
this has nothing to do

23:31.511 --> 23:32.912
-with the Farrells.
-No.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.447
-Now you say... you're saying...
-No, that's not the point.

23:34.481 --> 23:35.648
-It's all the coal company.
-Okay, no, I'm done.

23:35.682 --> 23:37.083
-Flipping and flopping all
over the place. -You hear me?

23:37.116 --> 23:39.586
I am done defending you.

23:41.588 --> 23:43.155
Just... let them
say what they like.

23:48.060 --> 23:49.028
-(kicks door)
-(Big Foster groans)

23:49.061 --> 23:51.598
(overlapping argument)

23:51.631 --> 23:52.899
MAN: I need my pipe!

23:52.932 --> 23:54.934
CORINNE:
I don't care what you need.

23:54.967 --> 23:56.736
What about what I need?

23:56.769 --> 23:58.170
-You're never here. -MAN: You
don't need shit, woman.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.106
CORINNE: Oh, I don't need shit?

24:00.139 --> 24:03.075
(overlapping argument)

24:10.249 --> 24:11.518
(Corinne shouts)

24:11.551 --> 24:12.852
(grunts)

24:12.885 --> 24:14.153
CORINNE: Sit down
on the goddamn couch!

24:14.186 --> 24:15.755
MAN: I ain't sitting nowhere!

24:15.788 --> 24:17.023
I need my pipe!

24:17.056 --> 24:18.057
(door bangs shut)

24:18.090 --> 24:20.660
(groans)

24:22.795 --> 24:24.063
Hi.

24:24.096 --> 24:28.801
You, uh... want some of these?

24:31.604 --> 24:33.239
Some of those right there?

24:33.272 --> 24:34.541
Not gonna hurt you.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.175
Come on, take them.

24:36.208 --> 24:37.143
(breathing heavily)

24:38.811 --> 24:40.513
There you go.

24:42.314 --> 24:44.083
You ain't going
to tell my mama?

24:44.116 --> 24:45.818
No.

24:45.852 --> 24:47.119
I ain't going to tell no one.

24:47.153 --> 24:49.221
Promise.
Go on.

24:52.058 --> 24:55.227
Now you just... you go back over
there and stay over there, okay?

24:55.261 --> 24:56.796
You just keep quiet.

24:56.829 --> 24:57.964
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.199
(groans)

25:25.124 --> 25:27.560
(lighter flicks, man inhales)

25:35.968 --> 25:38.671
(grunts)
Hey, you're not supposed to...!

25:38.705 --> 25:40.139
Get back here, you!

25:55.755 --> 25:56.856
(Big Foster grunts)

26:03.195 --> 26:05.598
(groans)

26:05.632 --> 26:07.299
I got him good, Pa.

26:12.371 --> 26:15.708
Bren'in, there's a situation
at Big Foster's place.

26:24.183 --> 26:26.085
Hey, what is going on?

26:26.118 --> 26:27.620
Stop.

26:27.654 --> 26:30.022
I said stop.

26:30.056 --> 26:31.123
Ayn sah-wyl.

26:32.358 --> 26:34.260
Bren'in, what's the matter?

26:34.293 --> 26:36.663
What is going on?
Th-This house belongs to...

26:36.696 --> 26:38.397
To your former husband.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.866
Yes.

26:39.899 --> 26:41.133
Y-You have no right
to ransack it.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.669
We were told
that your man had passed

26:42.702 --> 26:44.103
and no soul dwelled here.

26:44.971 --> 26:46.906
(G'Win stammers)

26:48.074 --> 26:50.109
No... the house is empty,

26:50.142 --> 26:51.177
yes, but...

26:51.210 --> 26:55.347
Oh... I see.

26:55.381 --> 26:59.018
You've not finished the
grieving of your terrible loss.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.222
I'm sorry.

27:03.255 --> 27:05.057
We meant no offense by it.

27:05.091 --> 27:07.226
We will find somewhere else.

27:10.930 --> 27:11.998
No.

27:13.866 --> 27:15.301
No, you're right.

27:15.334 --> 27:17.336
Better to make it a home
than let it fall to ruin.

27:19.839 --> 27:21.640
Ged badeh, Bren'in.

27:30.482 --> 27:32.418
(engine revving)

27:49.235 --> 27:51.103
Shit!

27:56.475 --> 27:58.410
(groans)

28:07.353 --> 28:09.922
(grunts)

28:17.429 --> 28:19.065
Oh, hell.

28:24.837 --> 28:26.272
Excuse me.

28:31.543 --> 28:33.012
(Houghton clears throat)

28:33.045 --> 28:34.213
(muttering):
Yeah, check.. yeah.

28:34.246 --> 28:35.247
Hey, uh, Gardner.

28:35.281 --> 28:37.049
Hmm?

28:37.083 --> 28:39.518
-Oh, hey, Wade.
-You got a moment to talk?

28:39.551 --> 28:41.954
Yeah, sure.
Uh, what can I do you for?

28:41.988 --> 28:43.355
(indistinct conversation)

28:43.389 --> 28:45.524
Say, if I see a person,

28:45.557 --> 28:48.494
and, uh, they're not getting
even like a...

28:48.527 --> 28:50.329
a half-decent representation.

28:50.362 --> 28:52.364
Is this a friend or relation?

28:52.398 --> 28:55.501
Uh, it's a... it's a
professional acquaintance.

28:55.534 --> 28:58.070
Uh-huh, criminal case then?

28:58.104 --> 28:59.271
Uh, yeah, a criminal case.

28:59.305 --> 29:01.373
So, I s-see this happening.

29:01.407 --> 29:04.243
I mean, uh, what are,
what are my options?

29:04.276 --> 29:06.378
Well, you... you talk
to this person,

29:06.412 --> 29:09.348
try to convince them
to hire a better lawyer?

29:12.084 --> 29:13.519
You want me
to keep talking to you?

29:13.552 --> 29:15.354
-Yeah.
-Uh...

29:15.387 --> 29:18.090
um...

29:18.124 --> 29:20.559
uh, like, I mean,
they-they ain't got no money.

29:20.592 --> 29:21.894
-Oh, a P.D.?
-Yeah.

29:21.928 --> 29:23.963
Got a public defender,
right.

29:23.996 --> 29:25.364
How's the case
against this person?

29:25.397 --> 29:27.366
It's thin.
I mean, it's real thin.

29:27.399 --> 29:29.368
It's pretty much
just guilt by association.

29:29.401 --> 29:30.569
Well...

29:30.602 --> 29:32.238
then you just hope it gets

29:32.271 --> 29:34.006
tossed out before trial

29:34.040 --> 29:35.407
or dismissed during.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.376
Just let the system
take care of it.

29:37.409 --> 29:40.046
Yeah, yeah, I mean,
that's the thing, Dan.

29:40.079 --> 29:41.413
I mean, I just thought...

29:41.447 --> 29:44.383
I mean, um,
would-would you consider,

29:44.416 --> 29:48.254
like, uh, taking on
a case like that?

29:48.287 --> 29:53.025
I mean, just out of
a sense of justice, you know?

29:53.059 --> 29:56.195
You're the best lawyer around
and, uh...

29:56.228 --> 29:58.931
I've got
to give you credit, Wade.

29:58.965 --> 30:01.233
You told me you loved me before
you tried to stick it in.

30:03.302 --> 30:05.037
I don't know about that,
but, um...

30:05.071 --> 30:07.339
I... mean, I think this man
deserves a proper defense.

30:07.373 --> 30:09.175
I assume we're talking
about that Farrell.

30:10.910 --> 30:12.578
Man, why do you care?

30:12.611 --> 30:14.914
I mean, why do you want to
get mixed up with all that?

30:16.148 --> 30:17.383
It's the right thing to do.

30:17.416 --> 30:18.417
Yeah, if you say so,

30:18.450 --> 30:19.485
but it's not the smart thing.

30:19.518 --> 30:21.320
That case, in this town,

30:21.353 --> 30:23.589
that guy's going away.

30:23.622 --> 30:25.224
And I've been around
long enough to know

30:25.257 --> 30:27.259
not to stand in front of
a freight train like that.

30:28.995 --> 30:30.496
And neither should you.

30:50.449 --> 30:52.584
Look what you've
done to yourself.

30:55.487 --> 30:57.289
It's a crying shame.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.258
You're not
such a big man now, are you?

30:59.291 --> 31:02.561
What if I shot you
in the face with your own gun?

31:02.594 --> 31:04.030
Huh?
You like that?

31:04.063 --> 31:05.231
That's mine, boy!

31:05.264 --> 31:06.966
-I found it!
-CORINNE: That's enough.

31:06.999 --> 31:09.902
(overlapping arguing)

31:09.936 --> 31:11.337
Shut it!

31:11.370 --> 31:13.205
(sighs)

31:13.239 --> 31:15.474
Took you into my home,
bent over backward

31:15.507 --> 31:19.311
to make you feel good...
and look at you.

31:19.345 --> 31:22.448
You ain't even
the least bit thankful

31:22.481 --> 31:24.316
for how good I've been to you.

31:24.350 --> 31:28.087
This doesn't mean that I'm
going to give up on you, no sir.

31:28.120 --> 31:30.622
I've got big plans for you.

31:35.294 --> 31:37.329
I'm going to teach you
graciousness

31:37.363 --> 31:41.033
if it's the last thing I do,
I will.

31:41.067 --> 31:42.234
Again.

31:42.268 --> 31:45.204
No.

31:45.237 --> 31:49.308
You're gonna need every inch
of the love and kindness

31:49.341 --> 31:50.977
we're gonna give you.

31:51.010 --> 31:52.411
Stitch him up.

32:03.990 --> 32:06.925
(grunting, breathing heavily)

32:12.064 --> 32:13.232
That's it.

32:14.433 --> 32:16.102
Another stitch.

32:29.181 --> 32:30.749
Bren'in, a moment?

32:30.782 --> 32:32.151
Of course.

32:32.184 --> 32:34.086
I know it's a ways off,
but I'm worried

32:34.120 --> 32:36.422
about the coming winter,
Bren'in.

32:36.455 --> 32:40.259
Every prognostication indicates
it'll be a long one and hard.

32:40.292 --> 32:43.295
I'm not sure how precisely

32:43.329 --> 32:46.265
we'll be able to feed
any extra mouths.

32:47.599 --> 32:49.201
The Kinnah, you mean?

32:51.103 --> 32:53.239
So, you're questioning
my decision,

32:53.272 --> 32:55.241
the decision of your Bren'in
to allow them to stay.

32:55.274 --> 32:57.609
Is that what you're
wasting all your wind on?

32:57.643 --> 32:59.611
I just wanted to bring
the fact to your attention.

32:59.645 --> 33:02.048
Fine, you have.

33:02.081 --> 33:04.016
There are stories about them
passed down.

33:04.050 --> 33:05.751
Some say they're thieves.

33:05.784 --> 33:07.419
You've seen what they done
at Big Foster's place.

33:07.453 --> 33:09.588
It don't make
none of those stories true.

33:09.621 --> 33:12.258
The Kinnah ain't strangers.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.560
They're clan.

33:14.593 --> 33:16.295
You'll see for yourself
at the ceilidh tonight.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.763
A ceilidh?

33:17.796 --> 33:19.631
They ain't got but what
they carried in on their backs,

33:19.665 --> 33:22.034
so we'll share with them
what's ours.

33:22.068 --> 33:23.369
A gifting.

33:27.506 --> 33:28.707
HASIL:
You took wheels.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.442
Goddamn it, I told you.

33:30.476 --> 33:32.778
I was only wanting to
go faster, get more done like.

33:32.811 --> 33:34.513
Where is he?

33:34.546 --> 33:36.282
Now it's bad enough
you could have been seen,

33:36.315 --> 33:38.450
but you might have broken
a piece of gear we sorely need.

33:38.484 --> 33:40.252
Yeah, well, I said I was sorry.

33:40.286 --> 33:42.454
Sorry is not what
we need right now, brother.

33:42.488 --> 33:44.490
What we need is to step up
and protect this family

33:44.523 --> 33:45.724
because it's the only one
we've got.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.793
You got me?

34:00.639 --> 34:02.808
Damn, man.

34:07.713 --> 34:08.647
Shit.

34:10.416 --> 34:12.351
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

34:18.424 --> 34:20.592
I'll take you up to county now
while you wait on your trial.

34:28.434 --> 34:30.068
Arms above your head.

34:34.473 --> 34:39.345
What do we look like to you,
when y'all came up our mountain?

34:39.378 --> 34:43.382
We look like animals and vermin,
evil spirits, what?

34:43.415 --> 34:44.550
Tell you the truth...

34:47.419 --> 34:48.787
...I don't remember anything.

34:51.290 --> 34:53.125
Hands at your waist.

34:53.159 --> 34:55.327
We could have killed
every single one of y'all...

34:56.795 --> 34:58.297
...but we didn't...

35:00.532 --> 35:02.668
because y'all are kin,
like human beings.

35:04.370 --> 35:06.238
We got laws, too.

35:07.473 --> 35:08.740
Courts and what-what do y'all

35:08.774 --> 35:11.277
call them down here, trials?

35:11.310 --> 35:12.478
We use them, but...

35:12.511 --> 35:14.580
not just to put
some problem in a cage,

35:14.613 --> 35:17.115
but to heal people.

35:25.624 --> 35:30.862
All right, I'm going to do
everything I can, okay?

35:30.896 --> 35:32.898
I promise you that.

35:32.931 --> 35:34.800
I believe you, Wade.

35:36.468 --> 35:38.804
But if you're lying,
like you were before...

35:40.739 --> 35:42.508
...you're going to pay for it.

35:49.748 --> 35:51.317
Okay, go.

36:06.398 --> 36:07.333
(door opens)

36:10.802 --> 36:12.504
Bren'in, can I talk to you
for a minute?

36:13.605 --> 36:15.274
What is it?

36:36.828 --> 36:38.330
I thought you'd want to know.

36:39.398 --> 36:40.832
It's, uh, Asa.

36:56.014 --> 36:57.416
Bury it.

37:00.586 --> 37:04.222
Not in our grounds,
halfway down the mountain.

37:05.857 --> 37:08.260
He never was one of us,
not really...

37:10.429 --> 37:12.398
...but he wasn't
one of them, neither.

37:14.833 --> 37:16.668
He belongs in between.

38:10.856 --> 38:12.791
(chains rattling)

38:19.998 --> 38:22.434
(Big Foster breathing heavily)

38:30.942 --> 38:33.345
You go outside...

38:33.379 --> 38:36.047
and you run as far as you can

38:36.081 --> 38:39.050
and don't you never come back.

38:39.084 --> 38:40.085
Okay?

38:41.152 --> 38:42.588
Go.

38:48.394 --> 38:50.396
(groans)

39:13.151 --> 39:14.486
Hey.

39:24.129 --> 39:26.498
Can I talk to you for a second?

39:26.532 --> 39:28.099
Look, if this is about earlier,

39:28.133 --> 39:30.368
-can we just...
-No, it's, uh, something...

39:35.741 --> 39:37.576
I found that in the mail.

39:39.144 --> 39:40.879
Why are they
sending that to you?

39:48.520 --> 39:49.555
Um...

39:52.157 --> 39:54.693
I have cancer.

39:54.726 --> 39:59.030
I had a pain in my side and I,
uh, I didn't think much of it,

39:59.064 --> 40:00.866
but I went to get it
checked out.

40:00.899 --> 40:03.068
It was a couple weeks back...

40:03.101 --> 40:08.039
and they, uh, took some tests
and got the results...

40:09.675 --> 40:13.745
and, uh... it's cancer.

40:13.779 --> 40:17.516
It's pancreatic cancer.
(chuckles)

40:20.719 --> 40:21.753
Oh.

40:23.054 --> 40:23.989
Oh.

40:25.557 --> 40:26.725
Ah.

40:26.758 --> 40:29.060
(under breath): Wow.

40:31.530 --> 40:32.798
Yeah.

40:35.834 --> 40:37.168
Uh, are they, uh... they...?

40:37.202 --> 40:38.937
-Yeah.
-Sure, yeah.

40:38.970 --> 40:41.206
As sure as they can be.

40:41.239 --> 40:43.174
Oh.

40:43.208 --> 40:46.578
I'm... I'm sorry, Wade.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.547
I-I'm sorry.

40:48.580 --> 40:51.049
There just hasn't been a good
time to tell you...

40:51.082 --> 40:53.619
or anyone.

40:53.652 --> 40:57.489
-Yeah. -But now...
now I guess you know.

40:59.024 --> 41:00.492
Yeah.

41:02.694 --> 41:06.097
Hey, kids, come downstairs,
supper's almost ready!

41:26.317 --> 41:28.754
(birds chirping)

41:32.558 --> 41:34.826
-MAN (on TV): Hey, what's going
on here? -(flies buzzing)

41:34.860 --> 41:36.595
Why aren't you preparing?
What's the big idea?

41:36.628 --> 41:39.097
WOMAN (on TV): The idea is
coming into this flat without...

41:39.130 --> 41:40.532
MAN (on TV):
Look, sister, this is an alert.

41:40.566 --> 41:41.867
So, let's deal with it...

41:52.043 --> 41:54.512
(TV continues playing faintly)

42:17.002 --> 42:19.270
(birds chirping)

42:29.615 --> 42:30.649
GUARD:
Opening.

42:30.682 --> 42:32.951
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

42:49.367 --> 42:51.302
(lock buzzes)

42:52.871 --> 42:54.239
They're here.
We'll set him in place.

43:06.852 --> 43:09.120
(lock buzzes, latch clicks)

43:28.940 --> 43:31.209
(breathes shakily)

43:33.879 --> 43:37.382
(crowd cheering)

43:37.415 --> 43:39.651
(upbeat music playing)

43:39.685 --> 43:40.886
Blessings for you.

43:40.919 --> 43:42.654
Here you are.

43:49.160 --> 43:51.629
(indistinct conversation)

44:03.041 --> 44:06.344
Bren'in, the Kinnah
thank you and your people

44:06.377 --> 44:08.179
for this gifting.

44:08.213 --> 44:09.948
Sah-wyl croeso thee.

44:12.951 --> 44:15.821
The moon nears a fullness.

44:15.854 --> 44:18.957
It's so beautiful from up here.

44:18.990 --> 44:22.427
We never saw it,
or the stars, so clear

44:22.460 --> 44:24.262
from down in our world.

44:30.201 --> 44:33.939
A sign of great change to come,
dost thou agree?

44:35.406 --> 44:36.808
How so?

44:37.876 --> 44:39.410
Your people have forgot so many

44:39.444 --> 44:41.412
of the things
the mountain knows.

44:43.448 --> 44:45.283
I'm glad to be here,

44:45.316 --> 44:48.920
so in time,
I may remind you.

44:55.927 --> 44:58.296
(woman shouts)

44:58.329 --> 45:00.766
(music stops, people muttering)

45:04.135 --> 45:06.404
Excuse me. Excuse me.

45:13.812 --> 45:16.181
(muttering):
Where is she?

45:16.214 --> 45:18.283
Where is she?

45:23.388 --> 45:25.156
Calling a Circle.

45:26.257 --> 45:28.794
(breathing heavily)

45:33.965 --> 45:34.966
(people gasp)
