35:40.334 --> 35:44.131
I ONLY WANTED TO PLEASE YOU.

35:44.133 --> 35:47.331
MY MOTHER,
SHE ALWAYS TREATED ME LIKE

35:47.333 --> 35:48.998
I WAS HER GREATEST COMPETITION.

35:49.000 --> 35:54.932
SO I THINK I JUST
WANTED YOU TO LIKE ME.

35:54.934 --> 35:58.198
BUT YOU NEVER DID.

35:58.200 --> 36:02.332
AND IT HURT.

36:02.334 --> 36:04.465
SO I JUST WANTED TO SAY

36:04.467 --> 36:09.465
THAT NO ONE SEES GRACE'S FAULTS
MORE CLEARLY THAN I DO,

36:09.467 --> 36:12.199
BUT THIS MESS,
THIS WHOLE MESS...

36:12.201 --> 36:13.265
WHICH ONE?

36:13.267 --> 36:16.598
EVERYTHING FROM MAC, FAITH,

36:16.600 --> 36:20.098
FAITH WALKING INTO THAT LAKE,
BISHOP GOING TO JAIL.

36:20.100 --> 36:21.098
HARMONY AND HOPE
IS ALL YOUR FAULT.

36:21.100 --> 36:22.965
- NO, EXCUSE ME.
- ALL YOURS.

36:22.967 --> 36:25.398
AND IF YOU KNEW THAT
YOU WOULD BE HOLED UP

36:25.400 --> 36:27.465
IN A... IN A SHACK
SOMEWHERE IN SACKCLOTH

36:27.467 --> 36:29.532
AND ASHES INSTEAD OF GLIDING
AROUND THIS HOUSE

36:29.534 --> 36:32.865
LIKE OUR FLOAT
IN THE ROSE PARADE.

36:32.867 --> 36:36.865
YOU ARE IN OLD RUSTY JALOPY
WITH A CORPSE IN THE TRUCK.

36:36.867 --> 36:39.032
AH!

36:43.534 --> 36:46.932
YOUR TRASH.

36:46.934 --> 36:50.131
YOU GET OUT OF THIS ROOM.

36:50.133 --> 36:52.398
DID YOU NOT HEAR ME?
I SAID LEAVE.

36:52.400 --> 36:54.865
I'M LEAVING
AND I'LL LEAVE FOR GOOD.

36:54.867 --> 36:57.065
- GET OUT!
- AND I'LL LEAVE FOR GOOD!

36:57.067 --> 36:59.599
YOU WILL NEVER SEE ME AGAIN
AND I WILL SEND JACOB UP HERE

36:59.601 --> 37:02.398
WITH THE CHILDREN LIKE
I WOULD ANYBODY TO A GRAVE.

37:02.400 --> 37:03.765
AND I AM NOT GONNA WASTE
MY TIME ON YOU ANYMORE...

37:03.767 --> 37:05.632
I WANT YOU OUT OF HERE. I'M NOT
GONNA HEAR ANOTHER WORD.

37:05.634 --> 37:08.231
'CAUSE I AM DONE!

37:08.233 --> 37:11.299
DANCING ATTENTION TO YOU.

37:14.634 --> 37:18.332
- HEY!
- SHH.

37:18.334 --> 37:24.065
HAVE YOU TWO MADE PEACE?

37:24.067 --> 37:27.332
HUH?

37:30.367 --> 37:32.665

37:32.667 --> 37:34.132
OH, GOOD.

37:34.134 --> 37:36.832

37:43.000 --> 37:46.532
IN THE SLIGHTEST DON'T.

37:46.534 --> 37:49.665
I'M TOO BORED.

37:49.667 --> 37:52.932
I'M NOT GOING TO ATLANTA.

37:52.934 --> 37:57.432
I CALLED DESIREE
AND I TOLD HER NO.

38:00.934 --> 38:02.265
I'M NOT GOING TO SAY
THANK YOU.

38:02.267 --> 38:04.131
NO, I AM.

38:04.133 --> 38:07.532
YOU KNOW, GOD'S BEEN TRYING
TO GET ME TO SLOW DOWN,

38:07.534 --> 38:12.398
SEE MYSELF, SEE HIM

38:12.400 --> 38:15.332
IN ALL THIS BUSYING MYSELF.
