00:53.278 --> 00:55.412
Hi, Tiffany?

00:55.414 --> 00:56.246
I'm Natalie.

00:56.248 --> 00:58.181
I understand this is your first.

00:58.183 --> 01:01.286
Please just lie back and lift
your shirt from your stomach.

01:27.180 --> 01:28.181
There it is.

01:30.016 --> 01:33.251
Eight weeks old and already
has a beating heart.

01:42.494 --> 01:45.295
Most mothers-to-be like
to record the heartbeat.

01:45.297 --> 01:46.632
We can do it on your phone.

03:50.223 --> 03:51.055
Hello?

03:53.726 --> 03:55.826
Boo!

03:55.828 --> 03:57.460
Oh fuck!

03:57.462 --> 03:59.997
I got you!

03:59.999 --> 04:02.233
I told you you were the jumpy
type.

04:02.235 --> 04:04.400
You're an asshole,
Joey!

04:04.402 --> 04:05.903
What, it's funny.

04:05.905 --> 04:06.806
It wasn't funny.

04:08.307 --> 04:09.574
I thought it was funny.

04:19.051 --> 04:20.416
I really need to go
now.

04:20.418 --> 04:22.186
She'll be here any
minute.

04:22.188 --> 04:23.453
Henry?

04:23.455 --> 04:24.454
Hey.

04:24.456 --> 04:25.289
I thought you were about to be
late

04:25.291 --> 04:26.893
for the first time in your life.

04:34.499 --> 04:36.399
What's with this tie?

04:36.401 --> 04:38.568
The demolition crew bought it
for me.

04:38.570 --> 04:39.404
As a joke?

04:40.572 --> 04:41.604
What, you think?

04:41.606 --> 04:42.873
Yeah.

04:42.875 --> 04:44.176
Like your stupid ringtone.

04:49.081 --> 04:51.447
Ah, so you love them after all.

04:51.449 --> 04:53.616
Love is a pretty
strong word,

04:53.618 --> 04:55.254
but I like to make you happy,
so.

04:57.657 --> 04:59.292
Hey, I'm gonna start my
patrol.

05:00.192 --> 05:01.027
Okay.

05:03.796 --> 05:05.029
Oh.

05:06.098 --> 05:06.931
Sorry.

05:06.933 --> 05:08.431
Uh, Mick's waiting for you.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.937
He's kinda itching to leave.

05:12.570 --> 05:13.739
I'll be there in a minute.

05:18.077 --> 05:19.643
Listen, um...

05:19.645 --> 05:20.746
Hey, Tiffany.

05:22.447 --> 05:23.479
Hey, Carl.

05:23.481 --> 05:24.848
How is Maggie?

05:24.850 --> 05:26.919
Took her first steps
yesterday.

05:28.387 --> 05:30.387
Only nine months old.

05:30.389 --> 05:32.156
Can you believe that?

05:32.158 --> 05:33.059
She's beautiful.

05:36.629 --> 05:37.728
Well.

05:37.730 --> 05:39.096
I'll be back with the demolition
team

05:39.098 --> 05:40.866
at four am for the final checks.

05:42.234 --> 05:44.337
Have a good last night guarding
this dump.

05:45.271 --> 05:47.237
His daughter is so cute.

05:47.239 --> 05:48.341
He really adores her.

05:49.375 --> 05:50.409
Better him than me.

05:55.948 --> 05:56.914
You okay?

05:57.883 --> 05:59.952
I will see you tomorrow.

06:05.557 --> 06:06.724
I'm taking my mom to bingo.

06:06.726 --> 06:07.660
I need to go.

06:09.428 --> 06:10.461
Do you hear me?

06:10.463 --> 06:11.596
The dead heard you.

06:17.535 --> 06:18.371
Fuck.

06:34.420 --> 06:35.886
Hello?

06:39.025 --> 06:39.992
Anybody there?

06:48.167 --> 06:49.633
I thought you were in a hurry.

06:49.635 --> 06:51.635
I need to make sure
I packed all my stuff.

06:51.637 --> 06:55.406
Joey to control, level
20 ready to be demolished.

06:55.408 --> 06:56.509
Copy that.

07:41.854 --> 07:43.554
Joey to control, level
19 secure

07:43.556 --> 07:45.091
and ready for demolition.

07:46.926 --> 07:49.726
Are you checking
everything properly, Joey?

07:49.728 --> 07:50.563
Yes.

07:51.664 --> 07:53.330
Lying little shit.

07:53.332 --> 07:54.765
You're moving too fast.

07:54.767 --> 07:56.834
Ensure everything has been
checked.

07:56.836 --> 07:58.969
Every door needs to be checked.

07:58.971 --> 08:01.972
Every corner needs a light shone
into it.

08:01.974 --> 08:04.208
You dropped the ball this week.

08:04.210 --> 08:05.042
It was one guy.

08:05.044 --> 08:06.944
In a secured location.

08:06.946 --> 08:07.780
Do it right.

08:30.603 --> 08:31.835
Joey to control.

08:31.837 --> 08:35.405
You should see the level 19
west stairwell door and alarm.

08:35.407 --> 08:38.008
The sensor's broken,
but the door's secure.

08:38.010 --> 08:38.844
Copy.

09:32.965 --> 09:36.969
Welcome to your tour
of the old dead building.

09:38.971 --> 09:41.305
I'll be your tour guide, Joey
Rambosa.

09:41.307 --> 09:42.773
- Now...
- Joey!

09:42.775 --> 09:47.044
And right here and we
have a real human turd.

09:48.347 --> 09:49.813
I know I can't say turd on the
radio,

09:49.815 --> 09:53.850
but on the private tour we
can get all the fun facts...

09:53.852 --> 09:54.885
All right, Joey, knock it off.

09:54.887 --> 09:59.489
So, this beauty here, she is
34 days old

09:59.491 --> 10:00.724
though we don't know
much else about her

10:00.726 --> 10:02.125
or who created her

10:02.127 --> 10:05.262
but that's how
exciting my job is.

10:05.264 --> 10:07.864
Can literally measure it in
shit.

10:07.866 --> 10:09.967
Joey, that's enough.

10:09.969 --> 10:14.004
Tune in next week when
we play my favorite game.

10:14.006 --> 10:16.440
Guess That Smear!

10:17.677 --> 10:18.510
So dumb.

10:19.979 --> 10:22.716
Level 18 ready to be
blown up.

10:24.550 --> 10:25.384
Okay.

11:52.204 --> 11:53.036
Joey to control.

11:53.038 --> 11:55.172
Level 17 secure, door seal
intact.

12:06.251 --> 12:07.451
You copy, Tiff?

12:07.453 --> 12:08.287
Oh shit.

12:10.255 --> 12:11.090
Yes, copy.

13:41.580 --> 13:46.585
♪ It's the most boringest
job in the world ♪

13:47.352 --> 13:50.755
♪ It never impresses a girl ♪

13:50.757 --> 13:52.989

13:52.991 --> 13:54.892

13:54.894 --> 13:59.531

14:01.033 --> 14:06.038
♪ In the world ♪

14:42.307 --> 14:43.875
Hey, hey, this is
Henry.

14:43.877 --> 14:45.544
You know what to do.

15:06.866 --> 15:11.468
Are you studying your
security course right now?

15:11.470 --> 15:13.103
Yes.

15:13.105 --> 15:14.306
What are you studying?

15:16.108 --> 15:19.944
How to secure a room that
has multiple entry points.

15:19.946 --> 15:22.414
Ah, using only
a toothpick and a condom?

15:26.019 --> 15:28.719
Hey, Joey, we have an
alarm on level 13.

15:28.721 --> 15:29.553
Moving.

15:32.759 --> 15:34.692
It's an east tenancy door.

15:34.694 --> 15:35.993
No other alarms.

15:35.995 --> 15:37.296
Stairwells reading secure.

15:39.732 --> 15:40.967
I'm here, going mobile.

15:45.672 --> 15:47.604
Unlock east stairwell door,
please.

15:58.617 --> 15:59.953
The security seal's broken.

16:02.154 --> 16:04.657
Door hardware seems to be
intact.

16:07.627 --> 16:09.896
It could just be water
compromised the seal.

16:15.068 --> 16:16.433
Am I authorized to enter?

16:16.435 --> 16:18.069
We are authorized.

16:18.071 --> 16:19.369
Enter with caution.

16:19.371 --> 16:22.539
Every brief in
this dump ends with caution.

16:22.541 --> 16:25.076
Shaking with caution.

16:25.078 --> 16:26.978
No alarm on the shaking.

16:26.980 --> 16:29.279
Okay, will shake the
door now

16:29.281 --> 16:30.347
and not just my booty.

16:30.349 --> 16:31.181
All right, be alert.

16:31.183 --> 16:32.650
Stop the clowning.

16:34.887 --> 16:36.087
Door's an alarm.

16:36.089 --> 16:37.556
Door remains secure.

16:44.631 --> 16:45.464
Entering.

17:41.688 --> 17:44.487
Have you found
anything?

17:44.489 --> 17:47.592
Something to do with
babies.

17:49.762 --> 17:52.497
Photos and stuff of birth
announcements.

17:55.200 --> 17:58.301
Are you saying the
tenancy hasn't been cleared?

17:58.303 --> 17:59.939
Yeah, I guess.

18:01.206 --> 18:03.475
Take photos of
everything and send it to me.

19:10.977 --> 19:12.275
Joey!

19:12.277 --> 19:14.346
Joey, is everything okay?

19:16.883 --> 19:17.817
Yeah, uh.

19:23.555 --> 19:24.755
The babies.

19:24.757 --> 19:25.756
What babies?

19:25.758 --> 19:26.824
Where?

19:26.826 --> 19:28.558
In the jar.

19:28.560 --> 19:30.060
Babies.

19:30.062 --> 19:32.098
One of them has a belly cord.

19:33.032 --> 19:33.866
Fuck!

19:39.939 --> 19:40.773
Do you see them?

19:42.875 --> 19:43.974
Yeah.

19:44.777 --> 19:46.179
What does it say on that label?

19:47.213 --> 19:48.444
The thing is really old,

19:48.446 --> 19:50.049
I can't make out the first part.

19:50.983 --> 19:52.716
Thatcher it says in the middle.

19:52.718 --> 19:55.054
The rest is faded and
unreadable.

19:59.826 --> 20:02.293
This is fucking disturbing,
Tiff.

20:02.295 --> 20:03.729
This is a colossal fuck up.

20:04.964 --> 20:06.329
They can't just demolish the
building

20:06.331 --> 20:08.098
with two dead babies in it.

20:08.100 --> 20:09.099
Ya think?

20:09.101 --> 20:11.202
How could
they have missed this?

20:11.204 --> 20:12.069
This?

20:12.071 --> 20:13.637
They put a damn security seal on
the door

20:13.639 --> 20:15.206
saying that the room was
cleared.

20:15.208 --> 20:17.473
I mean, that's a downright lie.

20:17.475 --> 20:19.844
How many other tenancies
haven't been cleared?

20:19.846 --> 20:22.114
I don't know, but somebody's
getting their ass kicked.

20:24.016 --> 20:26.052
Yeah, well, you know who
that'll be.

20:28.553 --> 20:29.387
What?

20:30.488 --> 20:31.356
What do you know?

20:33.192 --> 20:34.024
Forget it.

20:34.026 --> 20:35.592
What do you know?

20:35.594 --> 20:38.494
Henry signed off on it,
it's his responsibility.

20:38.496 --> 20:40.199
Get him down here
to deal with it.

20:41.701 --> 20:43.334
Oh, oh, don't get angry at me.

20:43.336 --> 20:45.636
We can't cross doors with
intact security seals on it,

20:45.638 --> 20:46.739
those are the rules.

20:54.046 --> 20:54.881
Right.

20:55.882 --> 20:57.513
Said the wrong thing.

20:57.515 --> 20:59.151
You took
photographs, right?

21:02.454 --> 21:03.654
Yes.

21:03.656 --> 21:05.992
Send them to me.

21:09.128 --> 21:09.962
File sent.

21:13.565 --> 21:15.134
Continue with the
patrol.

21:16.202 --> 21:18.202
Right after the seven shots of
tequila

21:18.204 --> 21:19.504
I need to calm down.

21:29.215 --> 21:30.615
Oh, God, Jesus.

22:42.288 --> 22:43.787
Hey, hey, this is
Henry.

22:43.789 --> 22:44.922
You know what to do.

22:44.924 --> 22:47.291
Hey, Henry, call me back
immediately.

22:47.293 --> 22:50.094
We discovered a tenancy
that hasn't been cleared.

22:50.096 --> 22:53.232
Due to the nature of it I
need to call the police.

23:08.314 --> 23:09.913
Metro Police
non-emergency,

23:09.915 --> 23:11.181
how can I help you?

23:19.925 --> 23:22.726
Ma'am, you can call 911 if it's
urgent.

23:22.728 --> 23:24.361
No, it's not an emergency.

23:24.363 --> 23:26.030
We will send
officers in the morning.

23:26.032 --> 23:26.930
I understand.

23:26.932 --> 23:28.065
Okay.

23:28.067 --> 23:30.069
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

23:32.838 --> 23:34.306
You scared the shit outta me!

23:36.574 --> 23:38.509
I found this in the room.

23:38.511 --> 23:39.712
And this was outside.

23:41.847 --> 23:43.981
You're not supposed to
take items out of that room.

23:43.983 --> 23:45.615
Look at the drawings in it.

23:45.617 --> 23:46.584
It's insane.

23:54.460 --> 23:56.028
Did you call Henry?

23:57.029 --> 24:00.531
I called the police, I made
them aware of the situation.

24:00.533 --> 24:01.365
They'll be here in the morning.

24:01.367 --> 24:02.567
It's not an emergency.

24:04.804 --> 24:06.637
That couldn't of been easy.

24:06.639 --> 24:07.840
It's called procedure.

24:08.808 --> 24:11.508
Now follow procedure and
get your ass back out there

24:11.510 --> 24:13.644
because there are floors
that haven't been checked.

24:13.646 --> 24:16.947
Yep, and each one of them has
signs

24:16.949 --> 24:18.982
warning of impending death.

24:18.984 --> 24:20.517
"Do Not Enter."

24:20.519 --> 24:21.584
"Demolition Area."

24:21.586 --> 24:25.621
"Explosives, you will
fucking die if you enter."

24:25.623 --> 24:27.191
I mean, seriously, fuck anyone
who doesn't

24:27.193 --> 24:28.527
pay attention to them.

24:29.495 --> 24:30.794
Our standing orders state that
a patrol

24:30.796 --> 24:32.064
may not be broken.

24:33.866 --> 24:35.732
I just saw dead babies in a
jar.

24:35.734 --> 24:37.203
Fuck our standing orders.

24:59.892 --> 25:00.726
Hey!

25:05.064 --> 25:05.898
What is it?

25:19.778 --> 25:21.013
What'd you see?

25:22.915 --> 25:24.917
Don't leave the control room
unstaffed.

25:36.362 --> 25:37.196
Who are you?

25:38.831 --> 25:40.666
This is a restricted area.

25:42.768 --> 25:45.804
The building is dangerous,
you must leave immediately.

25:51.577 --> 25:52.978
There's someone here.

26:11.764 --> 26:12.598
Get in.

26:14.934 --> 26:15.999
What'd you see?

26:16.001 --> 26:16.833
I don't know.

26:16.835 --> 26:17.870
A man I think.

26:18.737 --> 26:20.237
You saw him in the dark?

26:20.239 --> 26:21.373
I know how it sounds.

26:22.708 --> 26:24.808
There was someone in the
darkness

26:24.810 --> 26:26.512
and we have to go find him.

26:31.317 --> 26:32.382
21%.

26:32.384 --> 26:35.252
If we use the lights we
lose the security cameras.

26:35.254 --> 26:36.688
What asshole designed this
thing?

26:36.690 --> 26:38.422
The lowest bidder.

26:38.424 --> 26:40.324
How long until enough charge
builds up?

26:40.326 --> 26:41.760
An hour, probably more.

26:42.662 --> 26:44.261
It's a lot of darkness for me
to search

26:44.263 --> 26:45.495
with a flashlight.

26:45.497 --> 26:48.732
Not to mention the guy
running around in the shadows.

26:48.734 --> 26:49.568
I know.

26:50.803 --> 26:53.103
You're sure you saw this guy?

26:53.105 --> 26:53.939
I saw him.

26:56.775 --> 26:57.610
Shit.

27:09.755 --> 27:10.589
Wow.

27:16.495 --> 27:17.995
Why would you want children with
him?

27:17.997 --> 27:20.399
This isn't any of your
damn business, okay?

27:22.935 --> 27:24.134
East alarm again.

27:24.136 --> 27:25.569
I checked it
and I locked it again...

27:25.571 --> 27:28.572
I'll deal with it.

27:55.301 --> 27:56.833
Alarms have ceased.

27:56.835 --> 27:59.403
If there's someone there
they're still on that floor.

27:59.405 --> 28:01.138
Stairwells remain secure.

28:01.140 --> 28:03.273
Proceed with caution, I
get it.

28:03.275 --> 28:04.778
Proceed with weapons drawn.

28:30.869 --> 28:33.305
Door is secure and locked.

28:50.055 --> 28:50.889
Hello?

28:51.758 --> 28:53.658
Hi, this is Michael's
mother.

28:53.660 --> 28:56.126
He was supposed to pick me up
awhile ago.

28:56.128 --> 28:57.563
Are you keeping him late?

28:58.897 --> 29:00.530
Mick left on time, Glenda.

29:00.532 --> 29:01.965
I'm sure he'll be there.

29:01.967 --> 29:04.101
Oh, okay.

29:04.103 --> 29:04.937
Bye.

29:20.519 --> 29:21.353
Hello?

29:28.695 --> 29:30.195
Can you hear that?

29:33.867 --> 29:35.198
Where are they?

29:35.200 --> 29:36.801
I don't know.

29:36.803 --> 29:37.869
I can't find them.

29:37.871 --> 29:40.874
It sounds like they're in the
walls.

29:44.042 --> 29:45.676
Kids?

29:45.678 --> 29:47.146
It isn't safe to be here.

30:34.593 --> 30:35.427
Joey?

30:37.797 --> 30:38.665
Something is...

30:42.968 --> 30:45.335
He's in the basement stairwell.

30:45.337 --> 30:46.271
On my way.

30:57.684 --> 30:58.852
Somebody's down here.

31:00.486 --> 31:01.788
I'm seconds away.

31:09.829 --> 31:11.127
Be careful.

31:11.129 --> 31:12.030
Drag your sidearm.

31:20.372 --> 31:21.406
Yes, he's in there.

31:55.642 --> 31:56.475
Joey!

31:57.877 --> 31:58.945
Fucking hell, Tiff.

32:02.314 --> 32:03.748
What is it?

32:03.750 --> 32:05.317
Is everything okay?

32:07.386 --> 32:08.220
I'm all good.

32:09.588 --> 32:10.657
I'll make it back to you.

33:07.179 --> 33:08.280
That's weird.

33:25.263 --> 33:27.698
You were right, someone's down
here.

33:27.700 --> 33:29.332
I see their footprints.

33:29.334 --> 33:31.336
It's like they appeared out of
thin air.

33:54.226 --> 33:56.727
No one's
come through that door.

33:56.729 --> 33:57.594
They have a way of
moving through

33:57.596 --> 34:00.733
the building that we don't know
about.

34:01.768 --> 34:02.599
Hey, Joey.

34:02.601 --> 34:04.070
Level 13 is in alarm again.

34:06.806 --> 34:08.107
We still need to investigate.

34:13.378 --> 34:14.881
Fuck it, I know.

34:23.990 --> 34:26.389
Fuel level on the generator's
low.

34:26.391 --> 34:28.161
I'll fill
it when you get back.

34:43.776 --> 34:45.308
Elevator stopped, what's going
on?

34:45.310 --> 34:47.379
I don't know.

34:55.420 --> 34:57.353
What the fuck was that?

34:57.355 --> 34:58.189
What?

34:58.191 --> 34:59.255
What did you see?

34:59.257 --> 35:00.525
I don't know.

35:02.427 --> 35:05.665
An animal or...

35:08.201 --> 35:09.301
Stay alert down there.

35:10.335 --> 35:11.936
I do not get paid enough
for this bullshit.

35:11.938 --> 35:13.236
I heard that.

35:13.238 --> 35:14.306
You were meant to.

36:05.158 --> 36:05.990
The elevator's not here.

36:05.992 --> 36:07.126
Check your six!

36:54.707 --> 36:55.540
Uh.

37:10.957 --> 37:11.856
What happened?

37:11.858 --> 37:13.624
I got spiked!

37:13.626 --> 37:15.025
By what?

37:15.027 --> 37:17.562
Fuck this place,
where are fucking police!

37:26.038 --> 37:27.537
What are you doing?

37:27.539 --> 37:28.440
It isn't me.

37:30.042 --> 37:30.877
Help me!

37:48.560 --> 37:49.392
Open the door!

37:49.394 --> 37:50.562
Open the fucking door!

37:52.031 --> 37:53.596
Jesus.

37:53.598 --> 37:54.667
They're not people.

37:55.668 --> 37:56.667
What are you talking about?

37:56.669 --> 37:57.500
I saw 'em.

37:57.502 --> 37:58.335
I saw 'em, look at these photos.

37:58.337 --> 38:00.204
You're not supposed to
remove...

38:00.206 --> 38:01.338
Just shut up and look at them.

38:01.340 --> 38:02.174
What do you see?

38:11.717 --> 38:12.950
Oh my god.

38:12.952 --> 38:14.519
They're the same kids.

38:16.389 --> 38:18.222
The can't be, they're decades
apart.

38:18.224 --> 38:19.690
I saw them.

38:19.692 --> 38:20.523
Those kids.

38:20.525 --> 38:22.061
They chased me to the elevator.

38:23.362 --> 38:24.328
These children?

38:24.330 --> 38:25.629
Yes, these children and the
others too.

38:25.631 --> 38:27.264
They're not fucking human.

38:27.266 --> 38:29.135
They're not fucking human.

38:30.169 --> 38:31.270
Joey, show me.

38:39.211 --> 38:41.378
What the hell is that?

38:41.380 --> 38:42.880
Is that bone?

38:42.882 --> 38:43.948
Get it out.

38:43.950 --> 38:45.550
Just pull the fucking thing out!

38:50.622 --> 38:52.089
This needs a doctor.

38:52.091 --> 38:54.224
It's moving into me.

38:54.226 --> 38:56.459
It's burrowing into me.

39:05.204 --> 39:06.305
They're singing again.

39:12.610 --> 39:14.144
We have to get you out of here.

39:14.146 --> 39:15.848
I'll protect you, I promise.

39:17.316 --> 39:18.150
Saddle up.

39:20.552 --> 39:21.617
Are you fucking insane?

39:21.619 --> 39:22.686
We need to be able to see
them.

39:22.688 --> 39:25.289
That was all the power we had
left.

39:30.096 --> 39:31.097
What the fuck, Joey?

39:32.631 --> 39:33.799
Is that Mick?

39:36.035 --> 39:37.103
Why is he screaming?

39:39.005 --> 39:39.970
Why is he screaming?

39:39.972 --> 39:42.308
I didn't see him.

39:45.077 --> 39:46.944
No, no, no, come
back!

39:46.946 --> 39:49.382
Get your ass back here, Joey!

39:54.854 --> 39:56.353
Mick!

40:13.506 --> 40:14.340
Mick!

41:06.392 --> 41:07.960
Mick, where you at?

41:20.973 --> 41:21.972
This is Mick.

41:21.974 --> 41:24.477
Please leave a brief
message after the tone.

42:51.697 --> 42:54.634
What did you do to
her?

43:27.199 --> 43:28.367
Mick?

43:31.705 --> 43:32.538
Kill me.

44:05.037 --> 44:06.205
Tiff!

44:10.976 --> 44:12.378
Kill me.

44:18.917 --> 44:20.417
Kill me.

44:20.419 --> 44:23.322
Kill.

44:45.044 --> 44:47.244
Move, move!

44:47.246 --> 44:48.078
Kids!

44:48.080 --> 44:48.945
They're not fucking kids.

44:48.947 --> 44:49.783
Run!

44:55.821 --> 44:56.656
Inhaler.

45:01.427 --> 45:02.594
You're okay.

45:05.597 --> 45:06.865
You saved me.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.866
You need to control your
breathing.

45:13.272 --> 45:15.439
You're gonna be a great
mother.

45:19.478 --> 45:20.579
They're gonna kill us.

45:22.481 --> 45:23.748
Where's Mick?

45:23.750 --> 45:24.981
Did you find Mick?

45:24.983 --> 45:25.819
Yeah.

45:27.319 --> 45:28.786
He's dead.

45:31.023 --> 45:31.855
No, please don't.

45:31.857 --> 45:32.690
- Please don't go.
- Let me go.

45:32.692 --> 45:34.625
I tried, I tried, I tried.

45:34.627 --> 45:35.992
He was screaming for me to kill
him.

45:35.994 --> 45:37.628
I didn't mean to, I didn't mean
to!

45:37.630 --> 45:38.663
No!

46:23.743 --> 46:24.576
Mick.

47:26.673 --> 47:27.571
There's no body.

47:27.573 --> 47:28.407
What?

47:29.274 --> 47:30.974
I fucking shot him.

47:30.976 --> 47:33.045
He didn't just get up and walk
away.

47:33.947 --> 47:35.746
We need the police here.

47:35.748 --> 47:37.915
We need to get outta
here.

47:42.221 --> 47:44.454
Hi, this is Tiff with 115, I...

47:58.270 --> 47:59.873
They're gonna drag us to hell.

48:01.674 --> 48:02.508
We run.

48:18.457 --> 48:19.291
No.

48:28.567 --> 48:29.634
It's growing.

48:29.636 --> 48:30.536
What is it?

48:32.404 --> 48:33.603
Get it out!

48:33.605 --> 48:34.437
Pull it out!

48:34.439 --> 48:35.474
Get it out now!

48:37.409 --> 48:38.310
Get it out!

48:39.979 --> 48:41.444
- Stop!
- God!

48:41.446 --> 48:42.947
Oh, pull harder!

48:53.091 --> 48:53.925
It's moving.

48:59.531 --> 49:00.564
We're leaving.

49:00.566 --> 49:01.398
Get up.

49:03.636 --> 49:04.469
No.

49:07.740 --> 49:09.842
- Stop!
- What's happening?

49:10.877 --> 49:12.542
The building's going into
lockdown.

49:12.544 --> 49:13.378
It'll trap us.

49:16.849 --> 49:19.752
We need to run while
I'm still of use to you.

49:22.521 --> 49:23.688
We need to get outta here.

49:23.690 --> 49:24.956
You're not just saving yourself
anymore.

49:24.958 --> 49:26.558
They control the building now.

49:28.061 --> 49:29.392
We survive by digging in.

49:29.394 --> 49:30.861
We're armed and we're
sheltered...

49:30.863 --> 49:33.229
We're armed against
ghosts that can't be killed.

49:33.231 --> 49:34.832
We are burrowing like ticks
until Carl

49:34.834 --> 49:36.566
and the demolition team
arrive in the morning, okay?

49:36.568 --> 49:38.537
Just let me get you out!

49:41.741 --> 49:42.840
Fuck you!

49:50.248 --> 49:51.682
I'll lead them away.

49:51.684 --> 49:53.550
You make a run for it.

49:53.552 --> 49:54.384
No, no!

49:54.386 --> 49:55.853
No, no, Joey, no!

50:06.431 --> 50:07.832
We need help!

50:13.673 --> 50:15.340
What is it you want?

50:37.930 --> 50:38.765
Joey.

50:43.136 --> 50:44.202
I can't get out.

50:45.370 --> 50:46.371
The door won't open.

50:48.607 --> 50:49.676
Can you force it?

51:02.621 --> 51:04.287
It hurts so bad.

51:04.289 --> 51:05.490
What floor are you on?

51:09.662 --> 51:10.930
I don't know.

51:14.000 --> 51:16.466
Please try pushing the
basement button.

51:16.468 --> 51:17.302
Please.

51:23.275 --> 51:24.110
Joey.

51:29.548 --> 51:30.650
I love you, Tiff.

51:33.452 --> 51:35.154
I wish I would've told you
sooner.

51:38.290 --> 51:43.295
Hindsight is life's shittiest
teacher.

52:08.721 --> 52:09.987
Joey!

52:09.989 --> 52:11.456
Can you see anything outside?

52:16.129 --> 52:17.596
Joey, it's opening!

52:18.563 --> 52:20.731
Move, run!

52:34.046 --> 52:34.945
Joey, stop!

52:34.947 --> 52:35.782
Don't do it!

52:45.524 --> 52:47.057
My god.

52:47.059 --> 52:48.324
Joey!

52:50.630 --> 52:52.231
What are you doing?

52:55.868 --> 52:56.702
Joey, no!

52:57.770 --> 52:59.670
Joey, please!

52:59.672 --> 53:01.007
Joey, oh my god!

53:19.158 --> 53:20.660
I can't breathe.

53:25.064 --> 53:27.198
Tell me where you are!

53:37.375 --> 53:38.209
It's him!

53:38.211 --> 53:39.310
Joey, run!

53:49.755 --> 53:50.587
What floor, Joey?

53:50.589 --> 53:52.524
God damn it, what fucking floor?

53:55.862 --> 53:56.760
Shit.

53:59.564 --> 54:00.666
No, okay, um.

54:17.116 --> 54:17.950
Do it.

55:30.622 --> 55:32.425
I can see you, you fucker!

55:34.894 --> 55:37.595
If I can see you, I can kill
you.

56:29.915 --> 56:30.750
Joey.

56:33.786 --> 56:34.718
Joey, say something.

56:34.720 --> 56:35.553
Where are you?

56:36.956 --> 56:38.391
Tell me what floor you're on!

56:40.558 --> 56:41.394
What is that?

56:48.467 --> 56:49.301
Henry?

56:50.568 --> 56:51.569
Is that you?

57:15.494 --> 57:17.061
What do you want?

57:17.063 --> 57:18.164
Four!

57:22.501 --> 57:23.400
Oh no.

57:23.402 --> 57:25.369
Three!

57:25.371 --> 57:28.105
It's not religious people.

57:28.107 --> 57:29.075
Two!

57:30.876 --> 57:32.176
Fuck you!

57:32.178 --> 57:33.310
One!

57:47.460 --> 57:48.294
Joey.

57:49.962 --> 57:51.594
Where are you?

58:06.512 --> 58:07.346
13.

59:10.743 --> 59:12.178
Oh my god, Henry?

59:13.312 --> 59:15.080
What happened to you?

59:44.009 --> 59:44.843
Joey!

59:45.744 --> 59:46.579
Joey.

59:58.290 --> 59:59.124
Joey.

1:00:10.302 --> 1:00:11.136
Run.

1:00:12.338 --> 1:00:14.340
This is what you wanted.

1:00:15.241 --> 1:00:16.240
Run.

1:00:38.197 --> 1:00:40.430
Let me go, you fucker.

1:00:40.432 --> 1:00:41.699
Let me go!

1:00:54.980 --> 1:00:55.814
Six.

1:00:56.782 --> 1:00:58.652
Don't you fucking touch me.

1:01:16.402 --> 1:01:18.738
You shall bring them back.

1:01:21.741 --> 1:01:23.006
Oh my god!

1:03:07.847 --> 1:03:09.948
Don't you fucking come near me.

1:03:13.952 --> 1:03:14.953
Afraid of the light?

1:03:31.003 --> 1:03:31.838
You want this?

1:03:32.839 --> 1:03:33.740
Go get it.

1:04:04.503 --> 1:04:06.405
Everything seems fine.

1:04:09.208 --> 1:04:11.911
You can put all of this behind
you now.

1:04:14.346 --> 1:04:16.181
Now what is this here?

1:04:19.819 --> 1:04:21.487
Excuse me one moment.
