00:01.737 --> 00:04.108
‐ Announcer: <i>Previously...</i>
‐ Aarón: Hanger steak.

00:04.108 --> 00:06.246
<i>in a meaty</i>
<i>elimination test...</i>

00:06.246 --> 00:08.584
It's a very difficult
meat to get right.

00:08.584 --> 00:10.655
<i>it was Necco's beef</i>
<i>with the judges...</i>

00:10.655 --> 00:12.258
It looks disappointing.

00:12.258 --> 00:14.630
My presentation is
hands down the best.

00:14.630 --> 00:17.268
<i>that put an end</i>
<i>to his "MasterChef" journey.</i>

00:17.268 --> 00:19.272
Love you, Necco.

00:20.808 --> 00:25.284
<i>Tonight, the MasterChef</i>
<i>restaurant opens its doors</i>

00:25.284 --> 00:27.556
<i>to its most</i>
<i>important guests yet.</i>

00:27.556 --> 00:31.062
You're cooking
with their product.

00:31.062 --> 00:34.503
<i>And in a challenge</i>
<i>where the ingredients</i>
<i>take center stage...</i>

00:34.503 --> 00:36.507
If we don't get it right,
it could ruin the entire dish.

00:36.507 --> 00:38.476
<i>which team will</i>
<i>steal the spotlight</i>

00:38.476 --> 00:41.650
<i>and who will take</i>
<i>their final curtain call?</i>

00:41.650 --> 00:43.186
Gordon:
<i>Ricotta with halibut?</i>

00:43.186 --> 00:45.023
‐ Fish and cheese.
‐ Ricotta and halibut

00:45.023 --> 00:46.927
do not go together.

00:59.185 --> 01:01.122
‐ Whoo!
‐ Top 14!

01:01.122 --> 01:02.626
Welcome, welcome.

01:02.626 --> 01:04.563
This'll be fun.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.132
Jeff:
<i>We walk into</i>
<i>the MasterChef kitchen.</i>

01:06.132 --> 01:08.671
The layout
is totally different.

01:08.671 --> 01:11.309
<i>It is with red and blue.</i>

01:11.309 --> 01:14.315
That only means
it's a team challenge.

01:14.315 --> 01:17.722
Tonight, you'll be preparing
an incredible dinner,

01:17.722 --> 01:20.662
for a fully‐booked
restaurant.

01:21.997 --> 01:25.003
You'll be working
in two teams of seven.

01:25.003 --> 01:27.241
‐ Lovely.
‐ My favorite.

01:27.241 --> 01:30.447
So, in this kitchen
there's a 34‐year age gap

01:30.447 --> 01:32.852
between our youngest
and our oldest competitors,

01:32.852 --> 01:36.192
and we want to see some
of our younger generation
step up to the plate.

01:36.192 --> 01:40.367
So for this challenge,
we are picking the team
captains.

01:40.367 --> 01:42.104
Our first team captain
tonight is...

01:44.543 --> 01:47.549
21‐year‐old Adam.
Adam, step on up.
Grab this apron.

01:47.549 --> 01:49.085
‐ ( applause )
‐ Dino: Here we go, baby.

01:49.085 --> 01:50.588
Adam:
<i>I'm super psyched</i>

01:50.588 --> 01:52.559
<i>that the judges have put me</i>
<i>in this kind of position.</i>

01:52.559 --> 01:54.328
<i>Now's my time to shine.</i>

01:54.328 --> 01:55.565
Now's my time to
get out of the middle,

01:55.565 --> 01:57.669
and show everyone
what I really got.

01:57.669 --> 02:00.508
Our second team captain
tonight is someone who

02:00.508 --> 02:02.512
we see a lot
of potential in.

02:04.683 --> 02:07.589
Please step up, the youngest
lady in the kitchen,

02:07.589 --> 02:10.728
‐ Caitlin, let's go.
‐ Whoo!

02:10.728 --> 02:12.364
‐ Let's go.
‐ Thank you.

02:13.634 --> 02:15.538
Caitlin:
<i>I have diverse</i>
<i>leadership experience.</i>

02:15.538 --> 02:17.207
I'm a coach of a children's
dance team,

02:17.207 --> 02:20.247
I'm a personal trainer and
a group fitness class leader.

02:20.247 --> 02:24.054
So I know exactly
what it takes to make a team
work well together.

02:24.054 --> 02:25.090
Thank you.

02:26.425 --> 02:28.062
Caitlin,
you'll choose first.

02:28.062 --> 02:31.904
Um, so this home cook
has a laser set of eyes,

02:31.904 --> 02:34.275
and isn't afraid to jump
from task to task,

02:34.275 --> 02:36.680
so I'm choosing Daniel
to be on my team.

02:36.680 --> 02:37.916
Christina:
Daniel.

02:39.084 --> 02:41.088
Thank you.

02:41.088 --> 02:43.193
All right, Adam, the time
has come for you to choose
your first pick.

02:43.193 --> 02:45.598
My first pick
is somebody I've got
really good vibes with.

02:45.598 --> 02:48.436
somebody I can depend on
no matter what the situation.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.173
That first pick is Brien.

02:50.173 --> 02:52.311
‐ Gordon: Well.
‐ Thank you.

02:52.311 --> 02:53.948
Gordon: All right,
Caitlin, second choice.

02:53.948 --> 02:56.285
Cate, I would love
to have you on my team.

02:56.285 --> 02:58.289
‐ Yay, thank you.
‐ You're welcome.

02:58.289 --> 02:59.860
Right, Adam,
pick number two.

02:59.860 --> 03:02.966
That pick is Eboni.

03:02.966 --> 03:04.636
Miss Caitlin,
it's your turn.

03:04.636 --> 03:08.076
Jenny, I think you're
gonna be a great addition
to the Blue Team.

03:08.076 --> 03:09.579
‐ Aarón: Okay, Adam.
‐ Newton.

03:11.148 --> 03:12.986
‐ Thank you.
‐ Next up, Caitlin.

03:12.986 --> 03:15.591
‐ Gabe. I'd love to
have you on my team.
‐ Thank you.

03:15.591 --> 03:16.994
Yachecia.

03:25.110 --> 03:27.447
Now, Caitlin, you're picking
for both teams now.

03:27.447 --> 03:28.951
I've worked with
both Reba and Jeff

03:28.951 --> 03:30.821
on my last
team challenges,

03:30.821 --> 03:32.157
so I think
I have great insight

03:32.157 --> 03:33.861
into how they both
work on a team.

03:33.861 --> 03:37.702
One can be led,
and the other cannot.

03:37.702 --> 03:39.806
Okay, Reba, come
and pick up your apron.

03:39.806 --> 03:41.375
Just go for it.
Just go for it.

03:41.375 --> 03:42.979
Just go for it.

03:44.014 --> 03:45.250
Thank you.

03:49.325 --> 03:50.828
Now that we know
your teams,

03:50.828 --> 03:53.066
we should let you know
exactly who you'll
be welcoming

03:53.066 --> 03:55.705
into the MasterChef
restaurant tonight.

03:55.705 --> 03:58.777
Tonight, guys, we're gonna be
filling the restaurant with...

03:58.777 --> 04:02.284
the finest local
ingredient purveyors.

04:02.284 --> 04:03.887
‐ Ooh!
‐ Cool.

04:03.887 --> 04:05.624
‐ Awesome.
‐ Awesome, awesome.

04:05.624 --> 04:08.296
We're talking about
artisan butchers,

04:08.296 --> 04:10.801
vegetable farmers,
flour millers,

04:10.801 --> 04:13.006
beekeepers
and herb growers.

04:13.006 --> 04:16.178
These hardworking
people are the backbone
of the culinary world.

04:16.178 --> 04:18.483
‐ They certainly are.
‐ Gordon: Tonight,

04:18.483 --> 04:21.489
you're cooking
with their product.

04:21.489 --> 04:24.161
‐ Excited?
‐ All: Yes, Chef.

04:24.161 --> 04:26.098
Right.
Aarón.

04:28.403 --> 04:31.743
‐ Oh my God, I'm so excited.
‐ Yeah, this is gonna
be a good one.

04:31.743 --> 04:33.413
Daniel:
<i>The pressure</i>
<i>is definitely on.</i>

04:33.413 --> 04:35.951
<i>The chefs always say</i>
<i>it's all about the star</i>
<i>of the dish.</i>

04:35.951 --> 04:39.692
Well, the star of this dish
depends on who's eating it.

04:39.692 --> 04:41.763
<i>So we need to treat</i>
<i>every ingredient</i>

04:41.763 --> 04:44.736
like it's the main
component on the dish.

04:44.736 --> 04:46.740
Each team will have
one box to work with,

04:46.740 --> 04:48.744
and it will be up
to your teams to devise

04:48.744 --> 04:51.950
an incredible dish
using whatever
you find inside.

04:51.950 --> 04:54.388
The contents of these boxes
are identical.

04:54.388 --> 04:56.726
Red Team, Blue Team,
please take your boxes

04:56.726 --> 04:58.564
back to your stations.

04:58.564 --> 05:01.670
Brien:
<i>Overall, the Red Team</i>
<i>has more talent,</i>

05:01.670 --> 05:04.709
more poise and more knowledge
than the Blue Team.

05:04.709 --> 05:06.513
<i>I'm very confident</i>
<i>we can pull out a win.</i>

05:06.513 --> 05:10.521
Tonight, each team will
have just 90 minutes

05:10.521 --> 05:13.459
to transform our
fresh‐from‐the‐source
ingredients

05:13.459 --> 05:16.232
into MasterChef‐worthy
plates.

05:16.232 --> 05:20.473
Each guest will be served
a plate from the Red Team
and the Blue Team,

05:20.473 --> 05:24.749
and then they will cast
their vote for the dish
they preferred the most.

05:24.749 --> 05:26.953
Your 90 minutes...

05:26.953 --> 05:27.955
starts... now.

05:30.460 --> 05:31.897
Newton:
All right, guys,
what have we got here?

05:31.897 --> 05:33.800
‐ All right.
‐ Looking nice.

05:33.800 --> 05:37.407
Okay, guys, how do we feel
about the pork versus
the halibut?

05:37.407 --> 05:39.411
‐ All: Halibut.
‐ A well‐made halibut

05:39.411 --> 05:40.948
is very impressive.

05:40.948 --> 05:43.085
‐ Adam: We gotta go
for the pork.
‐ Yachecia: Yes.

05:43.085 --> 05:44.321
And then the polenta,

05:44.321 --> 05:45.323
and then do we like
the dates and‐‐

05:45.323 --> 05:46.993
‐ Yes.
‐ I do, too.

05:46.993 --> 05:50.166
I'm wondering, can
we get some sweetness
with the cherry tomato?

05:50.166 --> 05:51.703
Caitlin:
Tomato salad
would be good.

05:51.703 --> 05:53.974
I can make fresh ricotta
for the bottom of
the tomato salad.

05:53.974 --> 05:55.009
That's gorgeous.

05:55.009 --> 05:57.113
‐ One, two, three!
‐ All: Red Team!

05:57.113 --> 05:59.953
‐ One, two, three.
‐ All: Blue Team!

05:59.953 --> 06:01.590
Guys, we're just over
ten minutes gone.

06:04.228 --> 06:07.835
‐ Yachecia, you need about
two gallons of polenta.
‐ Two gallons.

06:07.835 --> 06:10.841
‐ Who needs white wine?
‐ I'll have a glass.

06:10.841 --> 06:13.112
So tonight is the battle
of the young guns.

06:13.112 --> 06:15.784
Captains, now.
Caitlin and Adam.

06:15.784 --> 06:18.590
Two dynamic, hungry,
determined youngsters.

06:18.590 --> 06:20.493
Just get prepared right now.
We have time.

06:20.493 --> 06:21.963
‐ Cut 'em all in half.
‐ Got it.

06:21.963 --> 06:23.432
Which team do you
think has it?

06:23.432 --> 06:25.370
‐ For me, it has
to be the Red Team.
‐ Stop.

06:25.370 --> 06:27.608
'cause Adam's a very
well‐seasoned young man.

06:27.608 --> 06:30.013
I think by virtue of him
being in Boston, in Harvard,

06:30.013 --> 06:31.616
he's exposed to a lot
of different cuisines.

06:31.616 --> 06:33.620
I like it.
Maybe a little more salt.

06:33.620 --> 06:35.791
Aarón:
<i>I think he has</i>
<i>a really savvy palate.</i>

06:35.791 --> 06:37.962
It's just gonna
be interesting to see
if he can translate that

06:37.962 --> 06:39.699
‐ to a team setting.
‐ Needs more oil, I think.

06:39.699 --> 06:40.801
Needs more butter, I think.

06:40.801 --> 06:42.672
Tonight, my money
is on the Blue Team.

06:42.672 --> 06:45.009
I think we're gonna highlight
their fingerling shape

06:45.009 --> 06:46.680
if we go long ways.

06:46.680 --> 06:48.817
Blue Team has been picked
purposely for her
to manage them.

06:48.817 --> 06:52.725
There's not a strong character
under Caitlin's tutelage.

06:52.725 --> 06:54.662
She is going to dominate
that Blue Team,

06:54.662 --> 06:55.864
and no one's gonna
step out of line.

06:55.864 --> 06:57.735
I would really like to have
the crispy skin on there.

06:57.735 --> 06:59.505
I think it's
a very smart move.

06:59.505 --> 07:01.141
But who is gonna
call Caitlin out

07:01.141 --> 07:02.945
if an idea doesn't
make sense on that dish?

07:02.945 --> 07:04.615
Jason:
Should we just take
off the skin?

07:04.615 --> 07:07.053
‐ It's gonna be
more problematic.
‐ That's what I'm saying.

07:07.053 --> 07:09.491
If we don't get it right
it could ruin the entire dish.

07:09.491 --> 07:12.698
But Caitlin, she
wants to do the skin.

07:12.698 --> 07:14.669
The skin, just clean the scales
Okay.

07:14.669 --> 07:16.038
Double speed
on the sauce,
get it done.

07:16.038 --> 07:17.073
Heard.

07:20.413 --> 07:22.752
‐ Right, Caitlin.
‐ Yes, Chef.

07:22.752 --> 07:24.922
Tell me about the dish.
What is it, what are you using?

07:24.922 --> 07:27.862
We are using halibut.
We are gonna do a nice
broiled halibut

07:27.862 --> 07:29.231
with crispy skin on top.

07:29.231 --> 07:30.734
You're keeping the skin
on the halibut?

07:30.734 --> 07:32.003
We're keeping the skin
on the halibut.

07:32.003 --> 07:33.573
Wow.
It's very rubbery.

07:33.573 --> 07:35.844
Very unforgiving.
Very fatty under there.

07:35.844 --> 07:37.515
‐ Sure.
‐ It needs to be crispy,

07:37.515 --> 07:39.017
but that's a nightmare
to get crispy.

07:39.017 --> 07:40.353
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ What's the side dish?

07:40.353 --> 07:42.257
So we have
fingerling potatoes.

07:42.257 --> 07:43.459
We're going to parboil them
and then we're going to

07:43.459 --> 07:45.229
cook them off in
a little bit of herb oil.

07:45.229 --> 07:46.365
Mm‐hmm, good,
that sounds nice.

07:46.365 --> 07:47.568
What else is going there?

07:47.568 --> 07:49.705
So we're doing tomato
purple basil salad

07:49.705 --> 07:51.408
with a homemade ricotta
right over here,

07:51.408 --> 07:53.379
because we had
such nice fresh milk.

07:53.379 --> 07:55.049
‐ Say that again?
‐ Homemade ricotta.

07:55.049 --> 07:57.822
Has anybody here
on the Blue Team had
halibut with fresh ricotta?

07:57.822 --> 07:59.224
‐ All: No, Chef.
‐ Has anyone here

07:59.224 --> 08:00.661
had halibut
with the skin on?
‐ All: No, Chef.

08:00.661 --> 08:02.497
‐ Okay, see where I'm going?
‐ Yes, Chef.

08:02.497 --> 08:04.535
There's elements
of your dish that are
lost in translation,

08:04.535 --> 08:06.706
and they're not making sense.

08:15.691 --> 08:18.630
Has anybody here
on the Blue Team had
halibut with fresh ricotta?

08:18.630 --> 08:20.032
‐ All: No, Chef.
‐ Has anyone here

08:20.032 --> 08:21.569
had halibut
with the skin on?
‐ All: No, Chef.

08:21.569 --> 08:23.372
There's elements
of your dish that are
lost in translation,

08:23.372 --> 08:24.775
and they're
not making sense.

08:24.775 --> 08:27.213
‐ Okay.
‐ Stop wasting time
with ricotta,

08:27.213 --> 08:29.084
‐ and rectify.
‐ 100%, Chef, got it.

08:29.084 --> 08:31.054
‐ Good luck.
‐ Caitlin: Okay,
let me do this.

08:31.054 --> 08:33.092
Start cooking the fish.
Do one skin on,
one skin off.

08:33.092 --> 08:34.795
The ricotta doesn't work,
scrap it.

08:34.795 --> 08:36.799
Don't stand by it and try
to fix it if it's not working.

08:36.799 --> 08:39.070
Ricotta isn't cheesy.
We're gonna bring it bright.

08:39.070 --> 08:40.908
It's gonna be the creamy
component of our dish.

08:40.908 --> 08:42.845
I think we just need
to stay strong behind it.

08:42.845 --> 08:44.749
‐ Just be confident?
‐ No matter what,

08:44.749 --> 08:47.086
take what he says
into consideration.

08:50.092 --> 08:52.765
Hot, hot.

08:52.765 --> 08:54.869
Okay, Blue Team,
brace yourself.

08:54.869 --> 08:57.841
They are serving a slice of
halibut with the skin on,

08:57.841 --> 09:00.446
basically wrapped
in its own rubber.

09:00.446 --> 09:01.716
There's no way you're
gonna get through it.

09:01.716 --> 09:02.885
It's an eighth
of an inch thick.

09:02.885 --> 09:04.922
‐ It will not render down.
‐ Gordon: Oh, my.

09:04.922 --> 09:06.960
‐ So this one has no skin.
‐ That one has no skin.

09:06.960 --> 09:08.630
‐ I love that.
‐ No one's gonna
miss the skin

09:08.630 --> 09:10.901
‐ if we can get that sear
consistently across.
‐ I agree.

09:10.901 --> 09:12.938
From there, they're
doing a salad tomatoes,

09:12.938 --> 09:15.309
with a herb oil,
but garnished,

09:15.309 --> 09:17.146
with a fresh ricotta.

09:17.146 --> 09:19.351
‐ Fish and cheese.
‐ Fish and cheese.

09:19.351 --> 09:21.488
Just start thinking
of a backup plan
for that ricotta,

09:21.488 --> 09:24.294
because I just think
they're worried about cheese
and seafood together.

09:24.294 --> 09:28.202
I think an avocado purée
underneath the tomatoes
would be good.

09:28.202 --> 09:29.872
‐ Okay.
‐ Yeah.

09:33.112 --> 09:35.483
Christina:
40 minutes to go, guys.

09:35.483 --> 09:37.286
‐ All right, Adam.
‐ Yes, Chef.

09:37.286 --> 09:38.690
Tell me about
the dish tonight.

09:38.690 --> 09:39.792
Absolutely. So the dish
that we're making

09:39.792 --> 09:41.729
is a pan‐seared pork chop

09:41.729 --> 09:44.034
covered in a pomegranate
and blood orange sauce,

09:44.034 --> 09:45.837
with honeyed,
roasted almonds

09:45.837 --> 09:48.677
and that's gonna be with
a creamy parmesan polenta

09:48.677 --> 09:50.514
garlic stir‐fried
bok choy,

09:50.514 --> 09:53.252
and gorgonzola‐filled dates.

09:53.252 --> 09:55.824
That's a lot of stuff
on a plate.

09:55.824 --> 09:58.663
‐ Yeah, it is.
‐ Make sure that it's
a cohesive dish.

09:58.663 --> 10:00.534
‐ Yes, Chef.
‐ All right, good luck.

10:00.534 --> 10:02.905
Adam:
All right, guys,
team huddle.

10:02.905 --> 10:05.042
The dates don't make
a lot of sense.

10:05.042 --> 10:07.180
I'm thinking maybe
take the dates instead,

10:07.180 --> 10:08.850
and chopping them up
with the almonds

10:08.850 --> 10:10.687
‐ to kind of combine those two.
‐ Yeah, they go together.

10:10.687 --> 10:12.858
‐ Boom.
‐ Red Team,
I'm hearing Adam's voice

10:12.858 --> 10:15.362
much more louder
and distinct than
I've ever heard before.

10:15.362 --> 10:17.033
Speed it up, guys.
Speed it.

10:17.033 --> 10:20.807
But I gotta say,
the Red Team's dish is
sounding a little strange.

10:20.807 --> 10:24.447
We've got a pork chop,
a garlic bok choy,

10:24.447 --> 10:26.819
‐ parmesan polenta...
‐ Oh, man.

10:26.819 --> 10:28.388
Pomegranate,
blood orange,

10:28.388 --> 10:30.059
blue cheese
soft‐stuffed dates.

10:30.059 --> 10:33.432
‐ Blue cheese dates?
With pork and bok choy.
‐ And polenta.

10:33.432 --> 10:35.236
Honestly,
that sounds dreadful.

10:35.236 --> 10:36.773
‐ You guys are doing great.
‐ Thanks, Chef.

10:36.773 --> 10:39.845
Guys, we gotta
get a move on.

10:39.845 --> 10:42.584
Right, Red Team,
Blue Team, listen up.

10:42.584 --> 10:44.755
Our purveyors are arriving.

10:44.755 --> 10:47.126
‐ Guests are here.
‐ Awesome, guests are here.

10:48.362 --> 10:49.965
Please welcome
our butchers.

10:49.965 --> 10:52.036
Yachecia:
Yeah, awesome,
welcome butchers!

10:52.036 --> 10:53.272
Our amazing fishmongers.

10:53.272 --> 10:55.442
( cheering )

10:55.442 --> 10:58.115
Welcome, guys.
Please make your way
into the restaurant.

10:58.115 --> 10:59.618
‐ Whoo‐hoo!
‐ Hey, buddy.

10:59.618 --> 11:01.321
These food purveyors
have our fate in their hands.

11:01.321 --> 11:04.060
Our fruit suppliers,
mushroom growers,

11:04.060 --> 11:05.630
our cheesemongers.

11:05.630 --> 11:08.268
Yachecia:
<i>I do not want to go</i>
<i>into a pressure test.</i>

11:08.268 --> 11:10.740
So we have to give them
five‐star quality.

11:10.740 --> 11:12.343
‐ Welcome!
‐ Thank you once again

11:12.343 --> 11:14.147
for that incredible
produce. Enjoy.

11:14.147 --> 11:15.951
Yachecia:
<i>And we've got</i>
<i>to show them we took time</i>

11:15.951 --> 11:18.088
and care in handling
these ingredients

11:18.088 --> 11:19.324
that they've given us.

11:19.324 --> 11:22.664
Red Team, Blue Team,
our purveyors are seated.

11:22.664 --> 11:25.336
We have 30 minutes to go.

11:26.973 --> 11:29.110
Carter:
<i>I've been a date purveyor</i>
<i>for over three years now</i>

11:29.110 --> 11:32.116
We put so much care and work
into these dates

11:32.116 --> 11:34.487
so I'm just kind of excited
to see what they come up with.

11:34.487 --> 11:36.024
Cream, cream, cream.

11:36.024 --> 11:37.794
I've been working
in the dairy industry
for eight years.

11:37.794 --> 11:40.567
<i>I know my dairy food products</i>
<i>because I use them every day,</i>

11:40.567 --> 11:43.305
<i>and I like to see them</i>
<i>incorporated in new and</i>
<i>exciting ways in a dish.</i>

11:43.305 --> 11:45.476
It'll be interesting to see
what the new chefs do.

11:45.476 --> 11:47.013
Gordon:
Let's go, speed up!

11:48.315 --> 11:50.419
Needs a lot more honey.
I want it sweet, sweet, sweet.

11:50.419 --> 11:52.490
I got nine portions
in this oven already.

11:58.001 --> 11:59.003
Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
Just put that on.

11:59.003 --> 12:00.674
We were literally
timing it.

12:00.674 --> 12:02.109
Yeah, I moved
and it's stickin'.

12:02.109 --> 12:04.280
‐ Here, just let him get it.
‐ We got it.

12:04.280 --> 12:05.684
‐ Okay.
‐ We got it, girl.
We got it.

12:05.684 --> 12:07.821
Okay. Where do
you want me to go, Adam?

12:07.821 --> 12:10.627
I can cook the pork.

12:10.627 --> 12:12.965
‐ I want you to help me
with the sauce.
‐ All right, come on.

12:12.965 --> 12:15.469
65 minutes,
and cook Brien O'Brien

12:15.469 --> 12:17.306
is still portioning
pork chops.

12:17.306 --> 12:18.977
Yeah, he's doing it
very clumsily.

12:18.977 --> 12:20.412
Not liking the look
of that one.

12:20.412 --> 12:22.383
‐ Chuck it?
‐ Yeah, chuck that on
the side.

12:22.383 --> 12:24.655
Cut exactly
at the bone.

12:24.655 --> 12:26.826
Gordon:
Also, when you cut them
into individual chops,

12:26.826 --> 12:28.028
they don't look anywhere
near as fatty,

12:28.028 --> 12:30.165
so he's removing the fat
before he cuts the portion.

12:30.165 --> 12:31.167
‐ Yeah.
‐ What an idiot.

12:31.167 --> 12:32.938
Yeah.

12:32.938 --> 12:35.175
That looks raw still, though.
Look at that.

12:35.175 --> 12:38.048
They gotta all be done, guys.
They gotta all be done.

12:40.119 --> 12:42.858
Right, Red Team.
Are all the pork chops
in the oven now?

12:42.858 --> 12:44.862
‐ No, sir.
‐ Who cut the pork?

12:44.862 --> 12:47.366
Show me that pork there.
Look at the size of that.

12:47.366 --> 12:49.037
Hold that one up,
please, Newton.

12:49.037 --> 12:50.305
Adam, come here.

12:50.305 --> 12:52.043
Put those
two pork down.

12:53.579 --> 12:55.917
They're‐‐ this one's too big,
this one's too small.

12:55.917 --> 12:58.388
Guys, come on.
Come on.

12:58.388 --> 13:01.227
Adam, as a team captain,
it's his job to pay attention

13:01.227 --> 13:04.668
and shift the boat,
move people around.

13:04.668 --> 13:06.237
It's the MasterChef
restaurant.

13:06.237 --> 13:08.576
What's going to happen
to those two different‐sized
porks?

13:08.576 --> 13:09.745
Both:
Cook at different times.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.515
They're supposed to sit
on the same table.

13:11.515 --> 13:13.719
Eboni:
<i>If Brien and Newton don't</i>
<i>get these pork sizes right,</i>

13:13.719 --> 13:15.590
we don't
got a dish, dummies!

13:15.590 --> 13:19.698
I am not serving raw pork
to the purveyor.

13:27.046 --> 13:28.649
It's the MasterChef
restaurant.

13:28.649 --> 13:30.987
What's going to happen
to those two different‐sized
porks?

13:30.987 --> 13:32.089
Both:
Cook at different times.

13:32.089 --> 13:33.492
They're supposed to sit
on the same table.

13:33.492 --> 13:36.932
When these pork hit the plate,
they need to be cooked.

13:36.932 --> 13:38.335
Correct, yes, Chef.

13:38.335 --> 13:39.337
What do you want?
Where do you want it?

13:39.337 --> 13:40.840
Dear, oh, dear.

13:40.840 --> 13:42.944
Seasoning, seasoning.

13:42.944 --> 13:44.982
Told you I should've
been doing pork chops.

13:44.982 --> 13:46.785
Brien, are you comfortable
on the grill?

13:46.785 --> 13:48.523
‐ I am, yes, Chef.
‐ Are you 100% comfortable‐‐

13:48.523 --> 13:49.925
100%, Chef.

13:49.925 --> 13:51.094
'Cause I'm thinking about
switching you with Eboni.

13:51.094 --> 13:52.631
‐ I'm 100% fine.
‐ All right, good.

13:52.631 --> 13:54.367
Make sure you don't
burn the other side.

13:54.367 --> 13:57.541
‐ I'm absolutely
on the hard sear, Chef.
‐ Good, good, good.

13:57.541 --> 14:00.212
Deep breath, guys.
You're doing awesome,
Blue Team.

14:01.782 --> 14:03.418
Ten minutes remaining.

14:03.418 --> 14:04.588
Sheesh.

14:04.588 --> 14:06.759
We need to start plating.

14:06.759 --> 14:08.495
They're just
starting to sear.

14:08.495 --> 14:10.165
Gordon:
Guys, here's my big worry.

14:10.165 --> 14:12.671
30 guests sat down
in the restaurant,
fully booked,

14:12.671 --> 14:14.273
and not one plate dressed.

14:14.273 --> 14:17.346
At this rate,
we've got a chance
of half the dining room

14:17.346 --> 14:18.415
not being served.

14:18.415 --> 14:20.118
Let's go, guys.
Let's go, fast!

14:20.118 --> 14:22.591
Crema, fish,
potato, yeah?

14:22.591 --> 14:23.593
Caitlin:
Agreed.

14:23.593 --> 14:25.095
Need to start
pulling pork.

14:25.095 --> 14:26.699
That's a good one.

14:26.699 --> 14:27.968
‐ Brien O'Brien.
‐ Yes, Chef.

14:27.968 --> 14:29.303
What do you think
is happening to the pork

14:29.303 --> 14:31.007
that's on the bottom of
that stack of pork chops?

14:31.007 --> 14:32.510
You're steaming
the bottom ones.

14:32.510 --> 14:34.347
All the residual heat
is cooking the ones
on the bottom.

14:34.347 --> 14:36.117
‐ Use your head.
‐ Yes, Chef.

14:36.117 --> 14:38.221
‐ Cate, can you check
that oven and the fish?
‐ Yep, yep, yep.

14:38.221 --> 14:39.958
Only Jason and
Caitlin are plating.

14:39.958 --> 14:40.994
Everyone else
on the Blue Team

14:40.994 --> 14:42.631
is still working
on cooking the fish.

14:42.631 --> 14:44.467
Let's work quickly, Jason.
I want to get the fish down.

14:44.467 --> 14:46.304
They're miles away, guys.

14:46.304 --> 14:47.907
You've gotta move, guys!

14:47.907 --> 14:50.546
Jenny or Gabe, I need
one of you up here now.

14:53.184 --> 14:55.088
Two minutes, guys.
Two minutes.

14:55.088 --> 14:57.092
‐ Come on, guys.
‐ This is where you
make it happen.

14:57.092 --> 15:00.365
Make sure every plate
has at least two or three
different colors of tomatoes.

15:00.365 --> 15:02.369
‐ Consistency is key.
‐ Absolutely.

15:02.369 --> 15:04.106
I need a crumb,
and I need a juice.

15:04.106 --> 15:05.475
Crumb and a juice,
right here.

15:05.475 --> 15:07.479
‐ Crumb and juice,
right here.
‐ Beautiful, beautiful.

15:07.479 --> 15:09.116
60 seconds to go.

15:09.116 --> 15:11.120
Man: All right,
just finishing touches.

15:11.120 --> 15:12.624
Caitlin: Everybody,
check, check, check.

15:12.624 --> 15:14.861
‐ Last plate.
‐ You need sauce?
Where's sauce?

15:14.861 --> 15:17.166
‐ No, we had one extra‐‐
‐ We have more sauce,
right there, hurry up.

15:17.166 --> 15:18.803
‐ Come up, guys.
‐ Christina: This is serious!

15:18.803 --> 15:21.040
‐ Gordon: Ten...
‐ Judges: Nine...

15:21.040 --> 15:23.879
eight, seven, six,

15:23.879 --> 15:26.351
‐ five, four, three,
‐ Make sure everything's
on there.

15:26.351 --> 15:28.221
‐ Is there one over there?
‐ Three, two, one,

15:28.221 --> 15:30.325
‐ Stop!
‐ Hands up, guys.

15:30.325 --> 15:32.664
( cheering )

15:32.664 --> 15:34.433
Service, thank you.

15:36.037 --> 15:38.776
Adam:
<i>I feel great.</i>
<i>The plate looks beautiful.</i>

15:38.776 --> 15:40.913
<i>You know, stacks and layers</i>
<i>and angles.</i>

15:40.913 --> 15:42.550
It looks like
a food bouquet.

15:42.550 --> 15:43.953
Great job, Captain.

15:45.088 --> 15:46.391
Good job, guys.
Thank you.

15:46.391 --> 15:48.529
I'm really confident
that each team member

15:48.529 --> 15:50.098
<i>nailed their specific</i>
<i>component.</i>

15:50.098 --> 15:52.236
<i>Every piece</i>
<i>is really consistent.</i>

15:52.236 --> 15:53.471
<i>The colors look amazing,</i>

15:53.471 --> 15:55.409
and I think the flavors
work really well together.

16:02.389 --> 16:06.364
Gordon:
Ladies and gentlemen,
good evening.

16:06.364 --> 16:09.938
Thank you so much
for gracing this incredible
MasterChef restaurant.

16:09.938 --> 16:12.242
You guys are
important to us,

16:12.242 --> 16:15.048
because you deliver
phenomenal ingredients

16:15.048 --> 16:16.451
on a daily basis.

16:16.451 --> 16:18.421
To honor that,
I hope tonight,

16:18.421 --> 16:19.925
both teams‐‐ the Red Team
and the Blue Team‐‐

16:19.925 --> 16:23.231
have done
your ingredients justice.

16:23.231 --> 16:26.137
Aarón:
So the Red Team has served
a grilled pork chop,

16:26.137 --> 16:29.043
<i>with an almond‐date crumble,</i>
<i>a blood orange sauce</i>

16:29.043 --> 16:33.652
<i>with a little parmesan polenta,</i>
<i>and pomegranate‐braised</i>
<i>bok choy.</i>

16:33.652 --> 16:35.322
Mm, it looks beautiful.

16:35.322 --> 16:38.061
Aarón:
<i>And the Blue Team has served</i>
<i>a pan‐seared halibut,</i>

16:38.061 --> 16:39.731
<i>with an herb‐butter sauce,</i>

16:39.731 --> 16:42.670
<i>fingerling potatoes,</i>
<i>heirloom tomato salad,</i>

16:42.670 --> 16:44.240
<i>and an avocado purée.</i>

16:44.240 --> 16:47.346
I love the green stripe
of fresh herbs across there.

16:47.346 --> 16:50.820
I think it really
gives a kind of sparkle
to the halibut.

16:58.769 --> 17:00.673
Wow, this fish looks
cooked perfectly.

17:00.673 --> 17:02.777
I don't think I need
a knife at all.

17:02.777 --> 17:05.215
‐ Yeah, that is
perfectly cooked.
‐ Wow.

17:05.215 --> 17:06.284
That is beautiful.

17:06.284 --> 17:09.591
The fish is a little bit
overcooked, I think.

17:09.591 --> 17:11.995
You want it to be
a little bit more tender,
more moist.

17:11.995 --> 17:14.601
This is a little bit
dry and flaky.

17:14.601 --> 17:16.337
What do you think?
I think we did enough.

17:16.337 --> 17:17.339
I think we done real good.

17:17.339 --> 17:18.408
These are
their ingredients,

17:18.408 --> 17:19.744
so we did 'em‐‐
hopefully we did them justice.

17:19.744 --> 17:22.650
And they know 'em better
than what we do.
A lot better.

17:22.650 --> 17:25.756
I love the combination
between the fish,
perfectly cooked,

17:25.756 --> 17:27.994
the avocados
and the basil.

17:27.994 --> 17:30.031
‐ They did us proud.
‐ They did.

17:30.031 --> 17:31.835
So the Blue Team's fish
was done very well.

17:31.835 --> 17:34.774
I would have liked to have seen
a lot more herbs on it.

17:34.774 --> 17:36.778
I feel like it really
needed that to liven it up,

17:36.778 --> 17:38.949
to brighten
the flavors.

17:38.949 --> 17:42.222
The Blue Team
did a beautiful job
on our tomatoes,

17:42.222 --> 17:44.661
which we pride
ourselves in growing,

17:44.661 --> 17:49.537
and they just showcased
the tomato perfectly.

17:49.537 --> 17:52.644
I'm switching gears
and I'm going to the
Red Team's pork chops.

17:54.881 --> 17:57.754
Newton and Brien, you guys
were just on it for the pork.

17:57.754 --> 18:00.325
Um, I did see, though,
maybe a few

18:00.325 --> 18:01.928
that could've been, like,
cooked a little bit more,

18:01.928 --> 18:04.099
but I think that's minor.
As long as the flavor's there,

18:04.099 --> 18:06.003
<i>the fat</i>
<i>was rendered down.</i>

18:06.003 --> 18:07.640
Well, it looks like
they did a good job
of getting

18:07.640 --> 18:11.280
a decent carmelization
on the pork chop,
which is always nice.

18:11.280 --> 18:13.284
My pork chop
is a little dry.

18:13.284 --> 18:14.788
Mine's amazingly juicy.

18:14.788 --> 18:15.956
‐ Is it?
‐ Yeah.

18:15.956 --> 18:19.296
I think we should
probably switch plates.

18:19.296 --> 18:21.868
I think the Red Team's
pork chop is fabulous.

18:21.868 --> 18:24.974
<i>It paired really, really</i>
<i>beautifully with the polenta.</i>

18:24.974 --> 18:28.481
I think the date rub really
put it over the top for me,

18:28.481 --> 18:31.320
especially since
I'm a date grower.

18:31.320 --> 18:33.992
I think I'm gonna have to go
with the Red Team on the pork.

18:33.992 --> 18:35.563
I think also Red, yeah.

18:35.563 --> 18:37.199
I might be a little bit
biased as a butcher, but‐‐

18:37.199 --> 18:38.936
I know, I was trying
so hard not to do that,

18:38.936 --> 18:41.340
But I really do think
they did a better job

18:41.340 --> 18:42.710
focusing on the protein.

18:42.710 --> 18:46.083
My pork was undercooked,
so I did not taste it,

18:46.083 --> 18:47.587
therefore I'm gonna
definitely go with

18:47.587 --> 18:49.591
the Blue Team's halibut,
which was really nice.

18:49.591 --> 18:51.695
I loved
the parmesan polenta.

18:51.695 --> 18:54.567
They did a really good job
of making it rich and creamy
and savory.

18:54.567 --> 18:57.439
My favorite dish
is the Red Team's.

18:57.439 --> 18:59.778
My winner is the Blue Team.
They did a stellar job.

18:59.778 --> 19:01.982
I couldn't say one thing
against what the Blue Team did.

19:01.982 --> 19:03.852
I'm really proud
of what we put forward,

19:03.852 --> 19:05.589
<i>and now it's just whether</i>
<i>or not the purveyors</i>

19:05.589 --> 19:08.327
<i>like our halibut</i>
<i>more than their pork chop.</i>

19:08.327 --> 19:10.733
‐ One, two, three.
‐ All: Red Team!

19:10.733 --> 19:12.603
( cheering )

19:16.845 --> 19:19.049
( applause )

19:19.049 --> 19:23.457
Hope you all enjoyed
your dinner here in
the MasterChef restaurant.

19:23.457 --> 19:25.763
Aarón:
It's our pleasure
to introduce the home cooks

19:25.763 --> 19:28.735
that prepared this lovely
meal for you guys.

19:28.735 --> 19:30.104
First up, the Red Team.

19:30.104 --> 19:33.377
( applause )

19:33.377 --> 19:34.379
Aarón:
Next up, the Blue Team.

19:34.379 --> 19:36.383
( applause )

19:39.389 --> 19:41.293
Christina:
All right,
ladies and gentlemen,

19:41.293 --> 19:43.097
we do have a winner.

19:43.097 --> 19:47.072
19 to one team,
11 to another.

19:47.072 --> 19:48.174
Wow.

19:48.174 --> 19:50.913
That's a pretty
serious landslide.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.253
Tonight's
winning team is...

20:07.379 --> 20:09.316
Tonight's
winning team is...

20:16.497 --> 20:18.034
‐ ( cheers )
‐ The Blue Team!

20:21.808 --> 20:23.645
Congratulations, guys.

20:23.645 --> 20:25.381
Caitlin, you captained
the team to victory.

20:25.381 --> 20:27.018
Great job,
and what a landslide.

20:27.018 --> 20:28.989
Red Team,
all of you will face

20:28.989 --> 20:30.693
the dreaded
pressure test,

20:30.693 --> 20:33.532
right now.

20:33.532 --> 20:36.070
To all our guests,
thank you once again.

20:36.070 --> 20:37.773
Red Team, Blue Team,
let's go.

20:37.773 --> 20:39.443
‐ ( applause )
‐ Blue Team,
head on upstairs.

20:39.443 --> 20:42.115
Red Team, please,
line up in front here.

20:42.115 --> 20:43.852
Adam:
<i>I'm completely dumbfounded.</i>

20:43.852 --> 20:45.054
I thought the Red Team
killed it.

20:45.054 --> 20:47.359
I thought we honored
the food purveyors.

20:47.359 --> 20:50.398
<i>I thought that I led</i>
<i>the Red Team to victory.</i>

20:50.398 --> 20:53.237
And I thought I did
personally very well.

20:53.237 --> 20:55.743
But I guess
none of those happened.

20:56.978 --> 20:59.216
Red Team,
not all of you

20:59.216 --> 21:01.654
will face tonight's
pressure test.

21:03.157 --> 21:05.028
Adam, you led this team.

21:05.028 --> 21:07.198
Based on everyone's
performance tonight,

21:07.198 --> 21:09.604
we want one name,

21:09.604 --> 21:13.512
and you can save yourself.

21:21.093 --> 21:22.696
Brien.

21:24.534 --> 21:25.702
I think
that's ( bleep ),

21:25.702 --> 21:27.072
because,
at the end of the day,

21:27.072 --> 21:28.307
the porks that were
coming off of Brien's

21:28.307 --> 21:30.411
was not up to the level
that needed to be done

21:30.411 --> 21:32.583
for these great purveyors
in there.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.921
I'm shocked, too.
Brien should have been
on another station.

21:34.921 --> 21:36.090
He would've been better.

21:36.090 --> 21:38.829
There was some type of
testosterone thing going on

21:38.829 --> 21:42.168
where he put his tail
between his legs.

21:42.168 --> 21:43.772
‐ You're at Harvard, right?
‐ Yes, Chef.

21:43.772 --> 21:46.511
Are you just listening
to what we just heard?

21:47.913 --> 21:50.251
‐ Why Brien?
‐ I feel that

21:50.251 --> 21:52.923
everybody on my team
performed extremely well.

21:52.923 --> 21:54.594
Gordon:
Stop.

21:54.594 --> 21:55.929
Let's cut the ( bleep ).

21:55.929 --> 21:57.666
‐ Why Brien?
‐ Just why?

21:57.666 --> 21:58.869
Just tell us why.

22:02.643 --> 22:04.212
'Cause I don't think
I can beat Brien.

22:06.216 --> 22:09.422
Well,
it's not up to you.

22:09.422 --> 22:11.661
‐ Ooh.
‐ ( laughs )

22:11.661 --> 22:14.767
Listen guys,
we heard from
all the diners tonight.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.405
There was one element
that stood out.

22:17.405 --> 22:19.075
Christina and Yachecia:
The polenta.

22:19.075 --> 22:21.915
‐ Who put
the polenta together?
‐ I did.

22:21.915 --> 22:25.923
And therefore, we're saving you
from this pressure test.

22:25.923 --> 22:27.458
Up to the balcony.

22:27.458 --> 22:29.496
‐ Come on, girl.
‐ ( applause )

22:33.037 --> 22:34.507
Jeff:
<i>I'm pissed right now.</i>

22:34.507 --> 22:36.678
Please grab a black apron
and put it on.

22:36.678 --> 22:38.314
Jeff:
<i>No one spoke up.</i>

22:38.314 --> 22:41.320
Our team put each other
on the line for going home.

22:41.320 --> 22:43.825
We're totally gonna
be thrown a curve ball here.

22:43.825 --> 22:46.798
I already know it's coming.

22:46.798 --> 22:49.637
Earlier you cooked an entrée
for 30 esteemed guests.

22:49.637 --> 22:52.342
You know what comes after
the entrée course, right?

22:52.342 --> 22:53.645
All: Dessert.

22:56.918 --> 23:01.393
What's inside this box
is a treasured Italian classic.

23:03.330 --> 23:05.769
They're the perfect ending
to any meal.

23:09.777 --> 23:10.812
Cannoli.

23:10.812 --> 23:14.787
Ow! Baby doll, yes!

23:14.787 --> 23:17.458
Christina:
<i>Rich, perfectly cooked</i>
<i>and rolled pastry,</i>

23:17.458 --> 23:22.302
<i>fried to perfection</i>
<i>then filled with that flawless</i>
<i>creamy filling,</i>

23:22.302 --> 23:26.343
and finished with the most
beautiful delicate garnishes.

23:26.343 --> 23:28.548
It's cannoli.
Oh, my God, it's cannoli.

23:28.548 --> 23:31.320
I didn't have a pacifier
growing up as a baby.

23:31.320 --> 23:32.523
I had a cannoli.

23:32.523 --> 23:35.996
Tonight, we're looking
for six perfect cannoli.

23:35.996 --> 23:38.033
Two flavors,
and three of each.

23:38.033 --> 23:40.839
And I must emphasize
at least one of you

23:40.839 --> 23:42.676
will be leaving tonight.

23:42.676 --> 23:44.580
All of you, head back
to your stations.

23:45.849 --> 23:47.686
Good luck, guys.
You got this.

23:50.057 --> 23:52.362
Christina:
At your stations
you have everything you need

23:52.362 --> 23:54.734
to make the perfect
cannoli shells.

23:54.734 --> 23:57.740
All the ingredients
for your custom fillings
and garnishes

23:57.740 --> 23:59.409
are in the equipment room.

23:59.409 --> 24:02.248
Your 60 minutes starts...

24:03.852 --> 24:05.922
now.

24:05.922 --> 24:08.394
‐ Let's go, guys.
‐ Whoo!

24:08.394 --> 24:10.331
( indistinct chatter )

24:12.603 --> 24:15.909
Guys, first baking challenge
in the competition.

24:15.909 --> 24:17.713
Probably should have
sifted the sugar.

24:17.713 --> 24:19.750
What are the steps
that these young home cooks

24:19.750 --> 24:22.388
should follow to execute
this cannoli flawlessly?

24:22.388 --> 24:24.459
First off the bat,
the cannoli dough.

24:24.459 --> 24:27.265
Butter, flour,
sugar, salt,

24:27.265 --> 24:28.935
an egg yolk,
and white wine.

24:28.935 --> 24:31.039
Get that dough together,
don't overmix it,

24:31.039 --> 24:32.241
and get it chilling.

24:32.241 --> 24:33.611
The big jeopardy here

24:33.611 --> 24:36.316
is in getting that dough
right at the beginning.

24:36.316 --> 24:37.586
I'm really confident
with what I'm doing
right now,

24:37.586 --> 24:38.888
and I'm gonna have
some fun with it,

24:38.888 --> 24:41.627
so I'm gonna be playing around
with candied bacon,

24:41.627 --> 24:45.267
caramel, with a bourbon‐filled
ricotta cheese center,

24:45.267 --> 24:46.971
and the next one
I'm gonna do is a blood orange

24:46.971 --> 24:50.411
with a chocolate ganache
with a balsamic filling to it.

24:50.411 --> 24:51.914
I won my apron
making a cupcake,

24:51.914 --> 24:53.585
so I think I'm gonna be
a‐okay on this.

24:53.585 --> 24:56.591
So I think I'm gonna do pecan
and Grand Marnier, if I can,

24:56.591 --> 24:58.761
and I'm gonna do
a raspberry chocolate,
I think.

24:58.761 --> 25:00.832
There's a very strong chance
that two people are
going home tonight.

25:00.832 --> 25:02.034
This is a tough challenge.

25:05.374 --> 25:06.544
Mmm!

25:06.544 --> 25:08.715
Gordon: Just under 35
minutes remaining.

25:08.715 --> 25:10.084
Right, Dino,
how you feeling?

25:10.084 --> 25:11.152
I'm feeling wonderful.

25:11.152 --> 25:12.556
This just brings me
back to my grandmother,

25:12.556 --> 25:14.894
The cannoli is something
I grew up with as a child.

25:14.894 --> 25:15.962
Sure. Where you
going with it?

25:15.962 --> 25:18.066
Today I'm gonna make
my grandmother's famous

25:18.066 --> 25:20.237
‐ Sicilian‐style cannoli...
‐ Right.

25:20.237 --> 25:22.174
It's a pistachio
mascarpone blend.

25:22.174 --> 25:24.412
The second cannoli that I have,
chocolate peanut butter.

25:24.412 --> 25:25.916
And you're gonna progress
into the next round.

25:25.916 --> 25:27.251
Based on the cannolis,
yes, Chef.

25:27.251 --> 25:29.122
Young man, you've got
just under 30 minutes to go.

25:29.122 --> 25:30.424
‐ Good luck.
‐ Thank you.

25:30.424 --> 25:32.261
Caitlin:
You got it, Dino,
baby.

25:33.363 --> 25:35.000
‐ All right, Adam.
‐ Yes, Chef.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.637
Your team kind of threw you
under the bus, huh?

25:36.637 --> 25:38.541
Yeah, absolutely.
Today, I learned

25:38.541 --> 25:39.977
that there are some vipers
in this kitchen,

25:39.977 --> 25:42.148
and I gotta watch myself
before I watch other people.

25:42.148 --> 25:43.785
Okay.
What are you making?

25:43.785 --> 25:46.323
We're making a matcha
ginger cannoli,

25:46.323 --> 25:49.028
and a cherry almond
cannoli.

25:49.028 --> 25:51.499
All right, Adam, who are
the two that are going home?

25:51.499 --> 25:53.638
Eboni and Jeff.
They're the ones
that I want home most.

25:53.638 --> 25:56.209
‐ ( laughs )
‐ Keep your eye
on that clock,

25:56.209 --> 25:58.480
‐ I want to see yours
perfectly done.
‐ Yes, Chef.

26:00.819 --> 26:02.254
Take a deep breath.
Take a deep breath.

26:06.429 --> 26:08.467
Miss Eboni, talk to me
about what you're making.

26:08.467 --> 26:11.172
I'm gonna try to do a
traditional cannoli filling,

26:11.172 --> 26:12.976
something dealing
with chocolate,

26:12.976 --> 26:14.647
something dealing
with raspberries,

26:14.647 --> 26:16.349
and I'm gonna add
strawberries right
at the end.

26:16.349 --> 26:17.519
‐ Okay.
‐ Other than that,

26:17.519 --> 26:19.122
never had a cannoli
before in my life

26:19.122 --> 26:20.290
so I'm kinda going
in it blind.

26:20.290 --> 26:22.729
But guess what?
I am a survivor.

26:22.729 --> 26:25.735
I'm from the dead‐ass hood,
the south side of Chicago.

26:25.735 --> 26:27.405
Ain't none of these rich kids
sending me home today.

26:27.405 --> 26:28.541
I got you, I got you.

26:28.541 --> 26:30.477
‐ Good luck to you, okay?
‐ Mm‐hmm.

26:34.419 --> 26:37.158
Christina:
All right, less than
ten minutes to go, guys.

26:37.158 --> 26:39.596
If you don't have those
cannolis going and frying,

26:39.596 --> 26:42.034
you'd better stop
what you're doing
and start frying them.

26:42.034 --> 26:43.705
Breathe, breathe, breathe,
breathe, breathe.

26:47.011 --> 26:49.449
Right, Brien,
tell me about the cannolis.

26:49.449 --> 26:51.052
Kind of a peanut butter
and jelly theme.

26:51.052 --> 26:52.689
Peanut butter chocolate,
and the other one

26:52.689 --> 26:54.225
I'm gonna do a raspberry
and white chocolate.

26:54.225 --> 26:55.595
‐ Right.
‐ I left my job.

26:55.595 --> 26:57.264
I left everything behind
to come do this,

26:57.264 --> 26:58.568
and I'm not ready
to go home.

26:58.568 --> 27:00.437
So if you're not ready
to go home tonight, who is?

27:00.437 --> 27:02.141
I think Eboni's
ready to go home.

27:02.141 --> 27:03.644
‐ ( laughs )
‐ I'm okay with that.

27:03.644 --> 27:05.047
It's mentally draining
being here.

27:05.047 --> 27:06.650
It's not just cooking
in a kitchen.

27:06.650 --> 27:09.188
It's missing your family,
missing your husband,
everything.

27:09.188 --> 27:10.992
‐ What, you think
she's checked out?
‐ I do.

27:10.992 --> 27:12.729
I don't know what's
going on in Brien head.

27:12.729 --> 27:14.867
Of course I miss my husband.
I'm a military spouse.

27:14.867 --> 27:16.871
I do this ( bleep ).
Worry about you, baby.

27:16.871 --> 27:18.674
So are you a better cook
than Eboni?

27:18.674 --> 27:20.210
Brien:
I believe I am, yes.

27:20.210 --> 27:21.246
Everyone down here, Chef.

27:21.246 --> 27:23.116
‐ Prove it.
‐ Yes, Chef.

27:25.220 --> 27:26.724
Keep doing you, girl.
Keep doing you.

27:28.795 --> 27:31.032
Three and a half
minutes to go.

27:32.803 --> 27:35.073
‐ Damn it.
‐ Brien's still
frying his cannolis.

27:35.073 --> 27:36.142
Three minutes!

27:36.142 --> 27:38.146
They take five minutes
to cool down.

27:38.146 --> 27:39.448
Christina:
Guys, I'm worried
about Jeff.

27:39.448 --> 27:41.554
I don't know that he can
pull this off.

27:41.554 --> 27:43.591
( muttering )

27:44.993 --> 27:46.797
Start filling
those cannolis, Jeff.

27:46.797 --> 27:49.603
Please move, please move.
Yeah, got it.

27:49.603 --> 27:51.439
Please move.
( bleep )

27:51.439 --> 27:54.412
Last two
minutes remaining.

27:54.412 --> 27:55.782
I'm not gonna finish this.
I'm not gonna finish this.

27:55.782 --> 27:57.586
Come on, Jeff, please!

27:57.586 --> 28:00.525
There's not enough.
There's not e‐( bleep )‐nough!

28:00.525 --> 28:03.898
‐ Uh‐oh.
‐ Jeff is losing it
back there.

28:03.898 --> 28:05.100
Aah!

28:10.612 --> 28:12.782
Two minutes remaining.

28:12.782 --> 28:14.118
I'm not gonna finish this.

28:14.118 --> 28:16.289
There's not enough.
There's not e‐( bleep )‐nough!

28:16.289 --> 28:17.592
I don't know that he
can pull this off.

28:17.592 --> 28:19.428
Aah!

28:19.428 --> 28:20.464
You can do it, Jeff.

28:20.464 --> 28:22.001
Yeah, I remember
my first cannoli.

28:22.001 --> 28:23.436
Breathe, breathe, breathe.

28:23.436 --> 28:26.342
We are down
to 60 seconds remaining.

28:26.342 --> 28:28.280
Christina:
Come on, guys!

28:28.280 --> 28:29.482
Come on, girl,
you got this.

28:29.482 --> 28:31.319
Christina: You gotta
fight till the end,
let's go.

28:31.319 --> 28:33.189
Gordon:
Brien, Brien, Brien.

28:33.189 --> 28:35.294
Christina:
Brien isn't even done
frying his cannolis!

28:35.294 --> 28:37.097
‐ Guys.
‐ Oh, jeez.

28:37.097 --> 28:38.601
Oh, jeez.

28:38.601 --> 28:41.674
Adam's filling is ( bleep )ing
out of the bottom, look.

28:41.674 --> 28:44.011
‐ Stay focused
‐ 30 seconds remaining.

28:44.011 --> 28:45.347
Christina:
Come on, guys.

28:45.347 --> 28:47.719
Gordon: If they're not
in the box, they don't count.

28:47.719 --> 28:50.057
‐ Let's go, Eboni.
‐ Christina:
You gotta go, Jeff!

28:50.057 --> 28:53.163
‐ You gotta go!
‐ Get it in the box,
get it in the box!

28:53.163 --> 28:54.967
Gordon:
Get them in the box!

28:54.967 --> 28:56.704
‐ Christina: Push yourselves!
‐ Gordon: Ten...

28:56.704 --> 28:57.706
Judges:
Nine...

28:57.706 --> 29:00.845
eight, seven, six,

29:00.845 --> 29:03.751
five, four, three,

29:03.751 --> 29:05.420
‐ two...
‐ One and stop!

29:05.420 --> 29:06.924
‐ Whoo!
‐ Yeah!

29:06.924 --> 29:07.926
( applause )

29:07.926 --> 29:09.763
Hell, yeah!

29:09.763 --> 29:11.934
Hey, so ( bleep ) you,

29:11.934 --> 29:14.438
and ( bleep ) you too,
said I couldn't do it.

29:14.438 --> 29:16.109
( smooches )

29:16.109 --> 29:17.344
Oh, my God.

29:17.344 --> 29:20.685
Gordon: All of you,
very carefully make your way

29:20.685 --> 29:23.356
down to the front, please.

29:23.356 --> 29:26.530
Adam:
<i>I put everything</i>
<i>into this pressure test.</i>

29:26.530 --> 29:29.068
Harvard is not
a culinary institution,

29:29.068 --> 29:32.141
but I still apply
Harvard rigor to my food.

29:32.141 --> 29:33.544
Gordon:
Leave the lids closed.

29:33.544 --> 29:36.349
Adam:
<i>And hopefully,</i>
<i>the contents of this box,</i>

29:36.349 --> 29:38.988
will be enough to send me
up to the balcony.

29:40.892 --> 29:41.994
Christina:
Let's begin the tasting.

29:45.067 --> 29:46.837
‐ All right, Adam.
‐ Chef.

29:46.837 --> 29:48.941
Tell me about these cannoli
I'm about to see.

29:48.941 --> 29:51.547
<i>This box is filled</i>
<i>with six really great</i>
<i>cannolis.</i>

29:51.547 --> 29:52.615
<i>I think they're</i>
<i>beautiful, Chef.</i>

29:52.615 --> 29:54.920
All right.
Moment of truth.

30:02.034 --> 30:03.904
Visually...

30:03.904 --> 30:05.040
they look sloppy.

30:05.040 --> 30:06.543
‐ Sure.
‐ Give me a little insight.

30:06.543 --> 30:10.417
<i>First flavor</i>
<i>is a combination</i>
<i>of ginger and matcha.</i>

30:10.417 --> 30:13.791
<i>The second combination</i>
<i>is a classic French</i>
<i>cherry and almond.</i>

30:13.791 --> 30:16.930
I'm gonna go into
the cherry‐almond first.

30:16.930 --> 30:19.401
The filling, is it
a classic ricotta filling?

30:19.401 --> 30:22.809
Classic ricotta filling
with maraschino syrup,
and whole cherries.

30:27.117 --> 30:29.421
‐ The shell's
beautifully fried.
‐ Thank you.

30:29.421 --> 30:32.595
but flavor‐wise, the cherry's
just kind of "eh."

30:32.595 --> 30:34.599
You kind of just put
those cherries into it,

30:34.599 --> 30:36.135
which isn't
enough technique.

30:39.375 --> 30:41.847
‐ Is this the ginger?
‐ That's ginger.

30:41.847 --> 30:43.784
How am I supposed to eat this
without it looking like

30:43.784 --> 30:47.491
a creature, like worms,
almost like it's infested?

30:47.491 --> 30:50.130
‐ If I swallow that,
I'm choking on it.
‐ Absolutely.

30:50.130 --> 30:51.567
Gotta be honest, Adam.

30:51.567 --> 30:53.804
I don't know if
they're good enough
to keep you in this kitchen.

30:59.148 --> 31:00.985
‐ ( bleep ) getting real.
‐ Yeah.

31:00.985 --> 31:02.589
Dino.

31:02.589 --> 31:05.828
This is a pressure test.
Usually people come into
this environment

31:05.828 --> 31:08.433
and are dreading it,
and you seemed to
almost want to just

31:08.433 --> 31:10.605
‐ go out there and tackle
this challenge.
‐ Yes, Chef.

31:10.605 --> 31:12.609
To be able
to present something

31:12.609 --> 31:15.313
that my grandmother
brought to me to you,

31:15.313 --> 31:16.717
like, I had her spirit
behind me.

31:16.717 --> 31:17.952
Let's take a look.

31:21.459 --> 31:22.795
‐ Wow.
‐ Stunning.

31:24.633 --> 31:26.670
That looks like
an Italian grandma
made that.

31:28.540 --> 31:29.709
So which one am I
having here first?

31:29.709 --> 31:32.381
<i>That is my Nana's classic.</i>

31:32.381 --> 31:36.022
<i>She did a pistachio cream</i>
<i>with mascarpone</i>

31:36.022 --> 31:37.725
<i>and blood orange zest,</i>

31:37.725 --> 31:39.395
She either had blood orange
or oranges,

31:39.395 --> 31:42.000
whatever was cheaper
at the market that week.

31:45.541 --> 31:47.912
‐ Man.
‐ Oh, my God.

31:47.912 --> 31:50.518
I love the blood orange zest,
'cause it perfumes that cream.

31:50.518 --> 31:53.891
It gives a nice relief
from something that is
just so rich.

31:53.891 --> 31:56.062
‐ Thank you.
‐ So what's this one?

31:56.062 --> 31:58.433
I had the cognac in there
with the roasted hazelnuts,

31:58.433 --> 32:00.370
and a little bit
of peanut butter.

32:01.540 --> 32:04.011
‐ Mmm.
‐ Good job.

32:04.011 --> 32:06.817
The bridge of chocolate
and hazelnut,

32:06.817 --> 32:07.919
makes total sense.

32:07.919 --> 32:10.524
Dino, this is how
you honor somebody.

32:10.524 --> 32:12.829
This is how you keep
their spirit alive,
with great food like that.

32:12.829 --> 32:15.266
‐ Thank you, Chef.
‐ ( applause )

32:15.266 --> 32:16.603
Textbook.

32:19.341 --> 32:21.445
‐ Eboni.
‐ Yes, Chef.

32:21.445 --> 32:23.349
Now, let's get
one thing straight.

32:23.349 --> 32:24.853
Brien O'Brien thinks
you've got

32:24.853 --> 32:26.690
one foot out the door
and you've checked out.

32:26.690 --> 32:28.025
How do you respond
to that?

32:28.025 --> 32:31.265
‐ It's in my food.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

32:31.265 --> 32:32.467
Gordon:
Let's have a look,
shall we?

32:38.379 --> 32:39.716
Young lady,
they look incredible.

32:39.716 --> 32:41.252
What's the flavors
in there?

32:41.252 --> 32:45.126
<i>I did a raspberry jam</i>
<i>that I cooked down in rum,</i>

32:45.126 --> 32:48.299
<i>with mascarpone and ricotta,</i>
<i>with a little bit</i>
<i>of lemon zest,</i>

32:48.299 --> 32:52.007
<i>and then I did another flavor</i>
<i>with Meyer lemon and vanilla.</i>

32:52.007 --> 32:53.610
How'd you get the lemon
inside the cream?

32:53.610 --> 32:56.282
I zested it, and then
I squoze about three lemons

32:56.282 --> 32:58.319
into the cream so I could
make two separate flavors.

33:03.463 --> 33:05.467
That is delicious.
I mean,

33:05.467 --> 33:06.703
the shell's delicious,

33:06.703 --> 33:09.208
and the filling
is just sumptuous.

33:09.208 --> 33:10.878
I'm amazed this is
the first time you've
made these things,

33:10.878 --> 33:12.915
because I don't think
this is a fluke.

33:12.915 --> 33:16.556
You've nailed
a near perfect cannoli.

33:16.556 --> 33:18.560
‐ Thank you.
‐ Great job. Amazing.

33:18.560 --> 33:20.296
‐ Man: Nice job, Eboni.
‐ ( applause )

33:20.296 --> 33:22.000
‐ Nice job.
‐ Gordon: Wow.

33:26.442 --> 33:27.578
All right, Brien.

33:27.578 --> 33:31.085
I'm looking for six
beautiful cannoli.

33:31.085 --> 33:32.287
Let's see what we got.

33:35.460 --> 33:37.364
How's your math?

33:37.364 --> 33:39.702
I failed to put
six in the box, Chef.

33:41.438 --> 33:43.777
‐ They look terrible.
‐ Right. What's in the box?

33:43.777 --> 33:46.215
<i>Today we have</i>
<i>a peanut butter</i>
<i>and jelly theme.</i>

33:46.215 --> 33:49.454
<i>The first one is peanut butter</i>
<i>and ricotta filled cannoli,</i>

33:49.454 --> 33:52.562
<i>and then the other one</i>
<i>is a raspberry coulis.</i>

33:52.562 --> 33:54.164
I'd rather have
four brilliant cannolis

33:54.164 --> 33:55.834
than six sloppy cannolis,

33:55.834 --> 33:57.538
but your problem is,

33:57.538 --> 33:59.676
I don't know that
any of these cannolis
look elegant.

33:59.676 --> 34:01.646
I mean, this one
just looks broken.

34:01.646 --> 34:04.084
I did spend much
too much time on the filling.

34:04.084 --> 34:06.455
I knew that I was
gonna run out of time,

34:06.455 --> 34:08.694
and so I just kind of
cut my losses.

34:08.694 --> 34:10.430
The filling is
definitely too loose,

34:10.430 --> 34:12.702
which is why it's
kind of starting to
look a little bit like

34:12.702 --> 34:14.606
with all due respect,
it looks a little throw‐uppy?

34:16.943 --> 34:19.181
‐ And this one?
‐ The peanut butter.

34:19.181 --> 34:22.220
Better ratio of filling
to cannoli shell.

34:25.159 --> 34:28.299
You know there's
nothing wrong with
that peanut butter filling,

34:28.299 --> 34:31.138
except it just doesn't
belong in a cannoli.

34:32.474 --> 34:34.712
‐ Not impressive.
‐ Yes, Chef.

34:41.526 --> 34:42.762
‐ Jeff.
‐ Hi, Chef.

34:42.762 --> 34:44.666
What happened at the end?
You were a little emotional.

34:44.666 --> 34:46.435
I always give 110%,

34:46.435 --> 34:49.341
and I don't think this was
one of those 110% moments.

34:49.341 --> 34:51.211
I mean,
before I open your box,
what am I gonna see?

34:51.211 --> 34:53.382
I think that this is
some crazy flavors,

34:53.382 --> 34:56.756
with a gourmet twist, but
it's gonna be a unique one.

34:56.756 --> 34:59.529
It's a marketing spiel.

34:59.529 --> 35:01.031
All right, so let's see.

35:07.377 --> 35:10.316
Oh, my God.

35:10.316 --> 35:12.420
Is this the end
of your time here, Jeff?

35:21.840 --> 35:23.175
All right, so let's see.

35:26.950 --> 35:28.018
( sighs )

35:30.123 --> 35:31.726
Oh, my God.

35:31.726 --> 35:33.897
Is this the end
of your time here, Jeff?

35:33.897 --> 35:35.199
I don't think so.

35:35.199 --> 35:36.870
Let's talk
about the obvious.

35:36.870 --> 35:39.441
There's five, and
the challenge was for six.

35:40.744 --> 35:43.382
‐ Did you eat one?
‐ ( laughs )

35:43.382 --> 35:45.386
So you have two flavors.
What are they?

35:45.386 --> 35:48.727
<i>A cannoli that is stuffed</i>
<i>with balsamic, mascarpone,</i>

35:48.727 --> 35:51.766
<i>and then it has a blood orange</i>
<i>chocolate ganache.</i>

35:51.766 --> 35:53.970
‐ What is this?
‐ Uh, that is a

35:53.970 --> 35:56.275
candied caramel
with a candied bacon in there,

35:56.275 --> 35:58.814
and then it has
a bourbon‐infused filling.

35:58.814 --> 35:59.949
( grunts )

36:00.984 --> 36:02.353
That's very savory.

36:02.353 --> 36:04.191
Tastes like bacon
that's been left
on the griddle,

36:04.191 --> 36:08.465
and then you just chopped
that up and then stuffed it
into a cannoli.

36:08.465 --> 36:11.873
And I'm looking down
this row of cannolis
and I'm just thinking...

36:11.873 --> 36:13.877
Adam, he's in trouble.

36:13.877 --> 36:15.246
Brien, I mean...

36:15.246 --> 36:17.985
he has the same
problem with math.

36:17.985 --> 36:21.258
I think you're in
that same boat right now.

36:27.303 --> 36:30.744
Newton, Newton, Newton,
give me something

36:30.744 --> 36:33.282
to rejoice, please.

36:33.282 --> 36:35.019
I can count to six.

36:35.019 --> 36:36.656
Give him a round
of applause, everybody.

36:36.656 --> 36:39.027
‐ ( applause )
‐ Amazing.

36:39.027 --> 36:40.429
All right, cowboy.

36:40.429 --> 36:43.670
Well, I put a lot of me
in these cannolis.

36:43.670 --> 36:45.339
Let's have a look,
shall we?

36:47.544 --> 36:49.281
They're not pretty,
let's get that right.

36:49.281 --> 36:50.349
‐ Yeah?
‐ Yes, sir.

36:50.349 --> 36:52.621
‐ What's in the filling?
‐ I did a ricotta

36:52.621 --> 36:54.190
<i>and mascarpone</i>
<i>cream cheese,</i>

36:54.190 --> 36:56.729
<i>with pecan, amaretto</i>
<i>and chocolate chips</i>
<i>on one of them,</i>

36:56.729 --> 37:00.069
<i>and then the other one</i>
<i>I did a raspberry</i>
<i>with chopped almonds,</i>

37:00.069 --> 37:02.373
‐ with a raspberry liqueur.
‐ Okay,

37:02.373 --> 37:04.645
so this filling here
is the raspberry one, right?

37:04.645 --> 37:06.315
‐ Yes.
‐ And what was
the percentage

37:06.315 --> 37:07.918
of ricotta
to mascarpone?

37:07.918 --> 37:09.622
50‐50.

37:11.458 --> 37:13.964
Beautiful,
look at the filling,
packed in there.

37:13.964 --> 37:16.602
Thin,
crisp on the outside.

37:21.813 --> 37:23.683
‐ Damn good.
‐ ( chuckling )

37:23.683 --> 37:27.056
Here's the thing:
rough around the edges,
great filling.

37:27.056 --> 37:29.562
‐ That's you, though,
isn't it?
‐ It is me, Chef.

37:29.562 --> 37:30.731
So just refine it,

37:30.731 --> 37:33.302
because there is
great potential there.

37:33.302 --> 37:35.239
‐ Are they the best? No.
‐ Yes, Chef.

37:35.239 --> 37:38.913
‐ However, it's a decent job.
‐ Thank you, Chef.

37:38.913 --> 37:40.684
‐ Good job.
‐ Caitlin: Nice, Newton.

37:40.684 --> 37:42.721
( applause )

37:45.927 --> 37:48.767
That was a really
intense pressure test.

37:48.767 --> 37:52.173
We're gonna need a minute
to discuss who stays
and who goes.

37:57.684 --> 37:59.354
We care
about the quality.

37:59.354 --> 38:02.427
Also consistency,
'cause that's a big part
of being a MasterChef.

38:02.427 --> 38:04.632
Brien:
<i>I left everything behind</i>

38:04.632 --> 38:07.036
to pursue my dream
of being the next MasterChef.

38:07.036 --> 38:08.740
<i>Adam can</i>
<i>go back to Harvard</i>

38:08.740 --> 38:11.411
and get an education,
and Jeff just had a baby

38:11.411 --> 38:12.981
<i>he probably needs to go home</i>
<i>and take care of.</i>

38:12.981 --> 38:14.350
This is everything to me.

38:14.350 --> 38:16.522
We can send one home,
we can send two home,

38:16.522 --> 38:18.158
or we can send three home.

38:18.158 --> 38:19.829
‐ Yeah.
‐ Happy?

38:19.829 --> 38:21.331
‐ Yeah.
‐ Yeah.

38:27.343 --> 38:30.382
Not gonna lie, it was
a very tough pressure test.

38:32.186 --> 38:35.226
There were some home cooks
who excelled,

38:35.226 --> 38:38.432
who really
impressed us tonight.

38:38.432 --> 38:40.770
two home cooks
that I think

38:40.770 --> 38:44.912
have just shot themselves
right to the front
of this competition.

38:44.912 --> 38:47.483
Please step forward,

38:47.483 --> 38:49.722
Dino and Eboni.

38:49.722 --> 38:51.158
‐ ( cheers, applause )
‐ Well deserved.

38:51.158 --> 38:55.600
‐ Nice job, you two.
‐ Great job.

38:55.600 --> 38:59.274
Aarón:
There's one more home cook
that we felt did enough.

38:59.274 --> 39:01.746
Please step forward
Newton.

39:01.746 --> 39:03.683
( applause )

39:06.188 --> 39:07.891

to the balcony.

39:12.366 --> 39:13.870
Eboni:
<i>I know some people still mad.</i>

39:13.870 --> 39:14.939
<i>They thought</i>
<i>they was sending me home.</i>

39:14.939 --> 39:16.408
<i>They like, "yes, yes!</i>

39:16.408 --> 39:18.278
<i>Miss South Side, goin' home."</i>
<i>Not today.</i>

39:18.278 --> 39:19.782
I ain't goin' nowhere.

39:19.782 --> 39:22.386
Gordon:
Well done.

39:22.386 --> 39:24.057
Adam, Brien, Jeff.

39:25.760 --> 39:27.564
This competition's
turning a corner.

39:27.564 --> 39:30.236
The stronger
are getting stronger,

39:30.236 --> 39:32.975
and the weaker
are becoming obvious.

39:36.081 --> 39:39.354
It might not just be one
leaving this competition.

39:40.924 --> 39:42.861
Adam, step forward.

39:44.464 --> 39:47.537
Jeff, step forward.

39:49.942 --> 39:55.219
Both of you
should have done
much better.

39:55.219 --> 39:57.156
Adam and Jeff...

39:59.294 --> 40:01.197
untie your aprons.

40:11.351 --> 40:13.923
Both of you,
head on upstairs.

40:19.668 --> 40:20.670
Thank you, Chefs.

40:27.951 --> 40:29.120
Wow.

40:31.859 --> 40:33.261
Brien,

40:33.261 --> 40:38.138
you just didn't come close
to giving us enough tonight.

40:38.138 --> 40:40.710
Gordon: Please,
take your apron off
and return home.

40:40.710 --> 40:42.881

‐ Love you, man.
Gonna miss you.

40:47.289 --> 40:49.728
Everyone has their day.
Today was not mine.

40:49.728 --> 40:51.097
Bye, Brien.

40:51.097 --> 40:53.235
Brien:
<i>Obviously I'm disappointed.</i>

40:53.235 --> 40:56.174
<i>Very few times in my life</i>
<i>have I ever been humbled,</i>

40:56.174 --> 40:58.445
but I'm gonna take this
as a learning experience.

40:58.445 --> 41:00.850
<i>I'm gonna go home,</i>
<i>with my head held high,</i>

41:00.850 --> 41:02.587

What can I do?
