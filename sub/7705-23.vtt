[instrumental music]

00:04.739 --> 00:07.406
Kate.. Kate, I got home
as fast as I could.

00:07.408 --> 00:09.908
- What's the emergency?
- What?

00:09.910 --> 00:11.477
Well, I had this message
at the office.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.545
It told me to get home
as fast as I could.

00:13.547 --> 00:15.581
Why, I didn't
leave any message.

00:17.618 --> 00:20.252
- You?
- I didn't say, "Rush home."

00:20.254 --> 00:24.256
I told them to ask you to,
"Get home as soon as possible."

00:24.258 --> 00:28.060
- You said it was an emergency.
- Yeah! The TV set is broken.

00:29.730 --> 00:33.399
- What?
- It's got audio, but no video.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.934
My guess is,
the picture tube is shot.

00:35.936 --> 00:40.072
You got me into a panic
to tell me that?

00:40.074 --> 00:44.009
Sorry, but I began to panic
when I missed "Gumby."

00:45.746 --> 00:48.814
Well, you're gonna miss a lot
more than "Gumby," buster

00:48.816 --> 00:51.884
because that TV set
stays broken.

00:51.886 --> 00:56.188
What? Willie, I'm a shut-in.
TV is my lifeline.

00:56.190 --> 00:59.124
I just pulled the plug on it.

00:59.126 --> 01:01.693
Apparently, it was
a mistake to call you.

01:02.997 --> 01:05.297
I think we watch too much TV
in this house, anyway.

01:05.299 --> 01:07.866
I mean this will be a good
chance to talk, to read

01:07.868 --> 01:09.835
to catch up on some chores..

01:09.837 --> 01:13.472
Super. Welcome to
"Little House on the Prairie."

[instrumental music]

02:29.783 --> 02:33.285
ALF, don't you have something
else to do besides stare at me?

02:33.287 --> 02:35.587
No.

02:35.589 --> 02:37.022
Fine.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.492
Why do you wash dishes before

02:40.494 --> 02:43.061
putting them
into the dishwasher?

02:43.063 --> 02:45.297
I'm not washing them,
I'm rinsing them.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.067
Doesn't the machine
have a rinse cycle?

02:49.069 --> 02:52.171
[sighs]
Yes, it's after the wash cycle.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.807
You wanna run
that by me again?

02:58.312 --> 03:01.313
I guess, we're all a little
testy without the TV.

03:05.452 --> 03:08.554
Yo, Lynn! Need some help
with the homework?

03:08.556 --> 03:11.156
Thanks, but it's
American history.

03:11.158 --> 03:13.025
- Pre-Civil War?
- Yep.

03:13.027 --> 03:14.560
Not my area.

03:15.930 --> 03:17.095
[humming]

03:19.066 --> 03:20.832
Catching up on
your reading, I see.

03:20.834 --> 03:23.535
Yes, isn't it refreshing,
having no TV?

03:23.537 --> 03:25.904
Yeah, invigorating.

03:25.906 --> 03:28.674
I assume you have no plans
to get it repaired?

03:28.676 --> 03:30.642
No immediate plans.

03:30.644 --> 03:33.745
Fine. I'll leave it
tuned to "Oral Roberts".

03:33.747 --> 03:35.847
Maybe it'll heal itself.

03:38.219 --> 03:39.885
Dad, I need some help.

03:39.887 --> 03:42.588
I have to make a project
for the science carnival.

03:42.590 --> 03:44.556
Is that anything
like a science fair?

03:44.558 --> 03:46.892
Yeah, only this has clowns.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.360
Well, what's the problem, Brian?

03:48.362 --> 03:51.029
- I don't know what to make.
- No problem.

03:51.031 --> 03:54.466
On Melmac, I was known
as Mr. Science.

03:54.468 --> 03:58.670
Oh, why can't Mr. Science
fix his own spaceship, then?

03:58.672 --> 04:02.708
Because Mr. Science
isn't good with tools.

04:02.710 --> 04:05.611
That's why I dropped
out of dental school.

04:05.613 --> 04:07.079
You went to dental school?

04:07.081 --> 04:10.449
Yeah, it was the easiest thing
I could think of.

04:10.451 --> 04:12.251
We only have four teeth.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.555
What can we make, ALF?

04:16.557 --> 04:19.625
Well, an electric
sandwich caddy.

04:20.861 --> 04:24.296
A machine that brings you
your sandwich?

04:24.298 --> 04:28.100
No, a sandwich that hands
you your golf clubs.

04:29.370 --> 04:31.637
Oh, that's a much better idea.

04:31.639 --> 04:33.272
Better than a rain gauge.

04:33.274 --> 04:35.407
How do you know about
the rain gauge? Lynn?

04:35.409 --> 04:38.644
I'm sorry, dad.
he found it in my closet.

04:38.646 --> 04:40.712
Nifty piece of work, too.

04:40.714 --> 04:43.315
I tried it out last month
and we apparently

04:43.317 --> 04:45.651
experienced 16 feet of rain.

04:47.021 --> 04:49.354
There's no need for you
to insult my rain gauge.

04:49.356 --> 04:50.822
Meteorology happens to be

04:50.824 --> 04:53.292
a very fascinating
branch of science.

04:53.294 --> 04:55.560
So is taxidermy.

04:55.562 --> 04:58.397
Which brings me to
my next suggestion..

04:58.399 --> 04:59.998
...let's stuff Lucky.

05:01.101 --> 05:02.834
Let's not.

05:02.836 --> 05:05.671
I think I'll work on
my science project alone.

05:05.673 --> 05:07.172
Thanks, anyway.

05:09.576 --> 05:11.910
Now, you see,
you see what happens

05:11.912 --> 05:14.012
when you're a butt-inski?

05:14.014 --> 05:16.648
Well, perhaps,
if the TV were working

05:16.650 --> 05:18.417
I wouldn't be a butt-inski.

05:18.419 --> 05:21.753
I doubt that.
Nice try, though.

05:24.124 --> 05:26.325
Mind if I read
over your shoulder?

05:31.231 --> 05:33.231
[instrumental music]

05:37.905 --> 05:40.105
TV is still on
the fritz, I see.

05:40.107 --> 05:42.507
Still broken,
if that's what you mean.

05:42.509 --> 05:43.975
Here's a petition

05:43.977 --> 05:46.545
signed by every
member of this family.

05:46.547 --> 05:50.782
It states that by hurting me
you're hurting others..

05:50.784 --> 05:53.251
...and ultimately,
hurting yourself.

05:56.023 --> 06:00.592
ALF, you signed
all these names.

06:00.594 --> 06:02.828
Yes, by proxy.

06:07.434 --> 06:09.634
That's your copy anyway.

06:09.636 --> 06:11.169
The original is notarized

06:11.171 --> 06:13.472
and on the way
to my attorney.

06:13.474 --> 06:15.240
Formally your attorney.

06:16.343 --> 06:17.943
Oh, ALF, I already said
you could use

06:17.945 --> 06:19.911
the portable TV in the bedroom.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.279
It's too small.

06:21.281 --> 06:24.883
It makes everyone
look like Danny DeVito.

06:24.885 --> 06:26.218
Well, for your information

06:26.220 --> 06:28.954
I'm sending the TV
back to the factory.

06:28.956 --> 06:32.691
The factory? Why don't you
just call a repairman?

06:32.693 --> 06:35.894
Because it's still
under warranty.

06:35.896 --> 06:37.429
Well, how long
is it gonna take?

06:37.431 --> 06:42.901
- Where is the factory?
- The factory is in...Libya.

06:44.671 --> 06:47.839
Libya? Is that
near Bakersfield?

06:47.841 --> 06:49.941
It's closer to Egypt.

06:51.278 --> 06:53.044
Apparently the guarantee
is void

06:53.046 --> 06:57.949
unless the work is performed
at "Moamar Electronics."

06:59.353 --> 07:02.320
And I have to pay
the shipping cost.

07:02.322 --> 07:04.890
But, honey, wh-what kinda
guarantee is that?

07:04.892 --> 07:07.259
I'd say a bad one.

07:07.261 --> 07:11.696
Alright, I didn't, I didn't
read the fine print, alright?

07:11.698 --> 07:13.732
This looks like a job for..

07:13.734 --> 07:15.400
¶ Eh-eh-eh ¶

07:15.402 --> 07:16.968
...Consumer Ed.

07:16.970 --> 07:18.937
- Consumer Ed?
- Yeah.

07:18.939 --> 07:20.238
The guy on the news

07:20.240 --> 07:22.774
who fights for people
being ripped off.

07:22.776 --> 07:25.610
Last week, he helped
a woman in Oxnard

07:25.612 --> 07:27.145
sue a soup company

07:27.147 --> 07:30.415
after she found a mouse head
in her minestrone.

07:30.417 --> 07:31.716
ALF!

07:31.718 --> 07:34.853
The company said
it was a garbanzo bean.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.855
ALF, please.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.557
It turned out to be a finger.

07:40.561 --> 07:42.761
- Excuse me.
- What's wrong?

07:42.763 --> 07:44.229
Consumer Ed got the lady

07:44.231 --> 07:46.832
a year's supply
of free minestrone.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.433
Enough.

07:48.435 --> 07:51.837
- I'll give the guy a call.
- Just stay out of this.

07:51.839 --> 07:53.238
Come on, Brian.
Show them.

07:53.240 --> 07:55.474
Look at Brian's science project.
It's really good.

07:55.476 --> 07:57.542
And I made it
without any help.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.078
Hey, nice job.

08:01.081 --> 08:03.248
What is it?
Street lights?

08:03.250 --> 08:06.651
I thought they called you
"Mr. Science"?

08:06.653 --> 08:08.653
It's a molecule.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.489
It's the solar system.

08:10.491 --> 08:12.757
It's the solar system.

08:12.759 --> 08:15.827
- Whose solar system?
- Ours.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.330
You forgot the
two planets next to Pluto.

08:18.332 --> 08:21.266
Let me guess..
Mickey and Donald?

08:22.169 --> 08:25.904
Oh, sure, turn it
into a travesty.

08:25.906 --> 08:27.873
Their names are
Dave and Alvin.

08:28.942 --> 08:31.776
- Really?
- No, Brian, ALF's only kidding.

08:31.778 --> 08:33.411
I'm not kidding.

08:33.413 --> 08:36.348
I almost hit Alvin
on my approach to Earth.

08:36.350 --> 08:38.984
It's a sharp turn.

08:38.986 --> 08:40.652
Where'd they be on here?

08:40.654 --> 08:43.455
Brian, they're not on here.
They're not anywhere.

08:43.457 --> 08:45.290
ALF, tell him the truth.

08:45.292 --> 08:48.627
The truth is, Brian,
they're right over here.

08:50.731 --> 08:52.831
ALF, I think if there were

08:52.833 --> 08:55.867
two planets
named Dave and Alvin

08:55.869 --> 08:57.769
I would have read about them.

08:57.771 --> 08:59.237
You could have missed it.

08:59.239 --> 09:02.607
After all, you let that
Moamar Electronics thing

09:02.609 --> 09:04.643
slip by.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.378
Dad, can I add Alvin and Dave?

09:06.380 --> 09:09.247
No, I don't think
that's a good idea.

09:09.249 --> 09:12.951
But if you don't add them
you're perpetuating lies!

09:12.953 --> 09:15.220
I mean, what if
Galileo had listened

09:15.222 --> 09:18.890
when they told him he couldn't
sail around the world?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.593
Galileo didn't sail
around the world.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.395
Oh, like you were there.

09:24.965 --> 09:27.599
ALF, if Brian adds those planets
they'll laugh him

09:27.601 --> 09:30.669
right out of school.
Nobody will believe him.

09:31.605 --> 09:33.838
Even if it is true.

09:33.840 --> 09:36.274
Even if it<i> is</i> true?

09:36.276 --> 09:38.276
That does it. I quit.

09:38.278 --> 09:40.712
- You quit what?
- I don't know yet.

09:40.714 --> 09:44.616
But when I do just try to talk
me out of it. Ha!

09:46.386 --> 09:49.721
Brian, your project's
very good, very, very good.

09:49.723 --> 09:52.157
Just like it is. Okay?

09:53.060 --> 09:54.793
I hope so.

09:54.795 --> 09:57.128
[instrumental music]

09:59.933 --> 10:03.268
Hello?
Yeah, Bob's Smoke Shop?

10:03.270 --> 10:06.471
Do you have
Prince Albert in a can?

10:07.741 --> 10:09.407
No?

10:09.409 --> 10:12.444
Well, can you tell me who does?

10:12.446 --> 10:14.879
Uh-huh. I see.

10:14.881 --> 10:16.548
Yeah. Thanks.

10:18.085 --> 10:20.151
This isn't as much fun
as I heard.

10:21.722 --> 10:24.189
Hey, B, how was school today?

10:24.191 --> 10:26.491
I failed my science project.

10:26.493 --> 10:29.828
You should've added
Alvin and Dave, like I said.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.631
- I did.
- And you still failed?

10:32.633 --> 10:33.965
That's why I failed.

10:33.967 --> 10:36.067
I added them
because I believed you

10:36.069 --> 10:38.069
but all my friends
laughed at me.

10:38.071 --> 10:39.504
They did?

10:39.506 --> 10:41.406
Now, my teacher won't
even let my project

10:41.408 --> 10:43.642
be in the science carnival.

10:43.644 --> 10:45.510
And it's all your fault.

10:45.512 --> 10:47.379
My fault?

10:47.381 --> 10:51.116
You lied to me. There really
aren't 11 planets, are there?

10:51.118 --> 10:53.585
Yes, there are.
Brian?

10:53.587 --> 10:56.321
Your teacher is the one
who needs an education.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.624
Now I'm mad.

10:59.626 --> 11:01.760
I'm mad! I'm mad.

11:04.031 --> 11:08.199
Hello, information?
Get me Brian's teacher.

11:08.201 --> 11:09.434
Oh, wait a minute.
No, uh..

11:09.436 --> 11:12.470
Get me
the Franklin Elementary School.

11:13.507 --> 11:16.174
Yes, I know it's cheaper
to use a directory

11:16.176 --> 11:19.077
but I don't have any thumbs!

11:19.079 --> 11:20.945
Well, you should be sorry!

[instrumental music]

11:25.152 --> 11:27.385
[instrumental music]

11:31.692 --> 11:33.191
Where is everybody?

11:33.193 --> 11:35.927
Oh, they've..
They've gone to the movies.

11:35.929 --> 11:40.365
- Well, why didn't you go?
- I'm fixing the TV.

11:40.367 --> 11:42.000
Now?

11:42.002 --> 11:44.102
Yes.

11:44.104 --> 11:45.437
I'm going out
a little later

11:45.439 --> 11:47.305
and I decided it's dangerous

11:47.307 --> 11:49.641
to leave you alone
with nothing to do.

11:50.777 --> 11:53.812
Are you referring to
that chemical spill?

11:53.814 --> 11:55.714
Chemical spill?

11:55.716 --> 11:57.182
What chemical spill?

11:57.784 --> 11:59.250
Nothing.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.453
Hey, Willie, how about a game
of Trivial Pursuit?

12:01.455 --> 12:04.355
I promise not to pick
any science questions.

12:05.659 --> 12:06.825
No, thanks.

12:08.495 --> 12:11.329
I think you should leave this
for a qualified repairman.

12:11.331 --> 12:15.667
- Well, Mr. Smarty..
- It's Mr. Science.

12:15.669 --> 12:19.437
For your information
I've-I've located the problem.

12:19.439 --> 12:24.776
There's no power going into
the high-voltage transformer.

12:24.778 --> 12:28.079
- Hey, you want power?
- 'That would help.'

12:28.081 --> 12:29.714
Your call.

12:31.151 --> 12:33.318
[crackling]

12:35.455 --> 12:38.223
Willie, it was an accident.

12:38.225 --> 12:40.024
An accident?

12:40.026 --> 12:44.262
An accident?
You almost killed me!

12:44.264 --> 12:46.798
And you say
it was an accident?

12:48.068 --> 12:50.869
Alright, let's call it
a mistake.

12:50.871 --> 12:52.170
[doorbell dings]

12:52.172 --> 12:54.906
You wanna get that?
It's probably Consumer Ed.

12:54.908 --> 12:59.644
You called Consumer Ed
after I asked you not to?

12:59.646 --> 13:03.348
You didn't say, "Not to."
You said, "Stay out of this."

13:03.350 --> 13:05.984
You should've been
more specific.

13:05.986 --> 13:08.419
I hope it<i> is</i> Consumer Ed

13:08.421 --> 13:11.356
because I'm turning
you<i> over</i> to 'em.

13:11.358 --> 13:15.627
Won't that be a great story
for the 6 o'clock news?

13:16.997 --> 13:19.297
I think I left the oven on.

13:20.567 --> 13:21.599
Yeah?

13:21.601 --> 13:22.834
[gasps]

13:24.204 --> 13:26.004
Mr. Tanner?

13:26.006 --> 13:27.705
Yeah?

13:27.707 --> 13:30.341
I'm Mrs. Lyman,
Brian's principal.

13:31.878 --> 13:33.344
Oh, hi, hi..

13:33.346 --> 13:35.814
Well, come in, won't you?
Please come in.

13:37.784 --> 13:40.885
Uh...am I interrupting
something?

13:40.887 --> 13:42.787
No, no.

13:42.789 --> 13:45.523
Well, I'm -I'm sorry
to drop in on you like this

13:45.525 --> 13:47.792
but your house
is on my way home

13:47.794 --> 13:50.395
and I did want to clear up
that little misunderstanding

13:50.397 --> 13:52.664
between you and Ms. Larva.

13:52.666 --> 13:55.033
Ms. Larva?

13:55.035 --> 13:56.835
Brian's teacher.

13:56.837 --> 13:59.304
Oh, Ms. Larva.

13:59.306 --> 14:01.506
You called her
this afternoon.

14:01.508 --> 14:05.677
No, I'm sorry, I didn't call
Miss...Larva this afternoon.

14:05.679 --> 14:07.178
No.

14:07.180 --> 14:08.947
Is Mrs. Tanner home?

14:08.949 --> 14:10.682
No, no, I'm alone here.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.718
Gee, th-that's odd.

14:13.720 --> 14:15.854
I-I thought I heard you
yelling at someone

14:15.856 --> 14:18.189
just before I rang
the doorbell.

14:18.191 --> 14:20.391
Oh, that was
probably the TV.

14:24.598 --> 14:26.598
I don't mean
actually the TV.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.334
I was yelling at the TV
because it's broken.

14:29.336 --> 14:33.037
I-I-I always yell
at the TV when it's broken.

14:33.039 --> 14:34.505
[laughing]

14:35.575 --> 14:37.642
We could talk
some other time.

14:37.644 --> 14:39.611
- Maybe with a social worker.
- No! I mean.

14:39.613 --> 14:41.679
[clears throat]
No, no, please, no.

14:41.681 --> 14:44.649
Come in, won't you? Sit down.
Please, let's-let's talk.

14:44.651 --> 14:46.651
Ah, this is about
my phone call, isn't it?

14:46.653 --> 14:49.087
Sit, sit.
I-I remember now.

14:49.089 --> 14:50.822
Of course, I remember.

14:52.425 --> 14:55.493
[clears throat]
What did I say?

14:55.495 --> 14:57.896
You don't remember?

14:57.898 --> 15:00.031
I don't. Forgive me.
Please, forgive me.

15:00.033 --> 15:01.933
My head just exploded.

15:01.935 --> 15:06.337
I mean, the TV exploded
and it was on my head.

15:08.041 --> 15:10.975
Well, you threatened
to remove Brian from school

15:10.977 --> 15:13.544
you questioned
the credentials of his teacher

15:13.546 --> 15:15.346
and you refused
to ask him to remove

15:15.348 --> 15:17.682
the two extra planets
from his project.

15:18.518 --> 15:21.119
The two extra planets?

15:21.121 --> 15:25.924
Yes. On one of which you
stopped to use the rest room.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.195
Could you excuse me,
just for a moment?

15:31.197 --> 15:32.797
Oh, certainly.

15:43.510 --> 15:45.043
What do you think?

15:49.049 --> 15:50.748
I'll get..

15:52.285 --> 15:54.385
I'll get right
to the point.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.587
You told Brian to add
those two planets

15:56.589 --> 15:57.722
to his model, didn't you?

15:57.724 --> 16:00.024
No, I didn't.
He did it on his own.

16:00.026 --> 16:01.259
Didn't you..

16:01.261 --> 16:04.028
Well, I'll admit
I was indirectly involved.

16:04.030 --> 16:08.132
It was wrong of you
to be involved at all.

16:08.134 --> 16:09.934
But I took care of it.

16:09.936 --> 16:12.770
I called his teacher
and set her straight.

16:12.772 --> 16:15.039
So I heard.
Now the principal is here.

16:15.041 --> 16:19.177
And it's all because of these
ridiculous stories of yours.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.179
Ridiculous? Ha!

16:21.181 --> 16:22.513
You're gonna feel
a little silly.

16:22.515 --> 16:23.848
when I tell you this

16:23.850 --> 16:27.485
but I called the
Mount Palomar Observatory today

16:27.487 --> 16:31.456
and they have no knowledge
of the planet Alvin.

16:31.458 --> 16:32.657
How surprising.

16:32.659 --> 16:36.294
They do, however,
know of Dave.

16:36.296 --> 16:39.397
Only, they call him Chiron.

16:39.399 --> 16:41.466
Chiron?

16:41.468 --> 16:43.835
Object Kowal?

16:43.837 --> 16:46.437
Willie?
Willie, snap out of it.

16:46.439 --> 16:49.640
No, ALF,
ALF, in the late '70s

16:49.642 --> 16:51.743
an object was spotted in space

16:51.745 --> 16:55.013
uh, originally called
Object Kowal.

16:55.015 --> 16:57.081
It was later named Chiron.

16:57.083 --> 17:00.718
And the astronomers thought
that could be a tenth planet

17:00.720 --> 17:03.621
just somewhere,
just beyond Pluto.

17:03.623 --> 17:06.424
Somewhere?
I'll show you exactly where.

17:06.426 --> 17:08.393
Wh-what's this?

17:08.395 --> 17:10.728
"Rand McNally,
guide to the stars."

17:10.730 --> 17:13.531
I keep it
in my glove compartment.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.534
This..
This is incredible!

17:16.536 --> 17:19.070
You-you have a guide
to the galaxy.

17:19.072 --> 17:20.671
Well, it's three years old.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.674
A few of the stars
have exploded.

17:23.676 --> 17:27.145
Now let's see, uh,
Dave, uh.. Dave, G6.

17:28.715 --> 17:31.916
"Mileage between cities?"
Melmac, San Francisco..

17:31.918 --> 17:33.885
Oh, here it is..
Dave. Right here.

17:33.887 --> 17:36.788
- Dave?
- And there's Alvin.

17:37.590 --> 17:39.957
Wh-what's that little one?

17:39.959 --> 17:41.826
"Alvin Heights."

17:41.828 --> 17:45.229
ALF, you weren't
making this up.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.965
I.. I owe you an apology.

17:50.370 --> 17:52.437
I'm waiting.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.672
So is Mrs. Lyman.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.042
Oh, say, could I get
you anything?

17:58.044 --> 17:59.677
No, no, I'm-I'm fine.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.747
Oh, oh, wax lips.

18:06.486 --> 18:08.820
- I have two questions for you.
- Yeah.

18:08.822 --> 18:11.355
First, can I have
my lips back?

18:11.357 --> 18:13.558
- Oh..
- Thanks.

18:13.560 --> 18:15.393
And second,
are you gonna tell her

18:15.395 --> 18:18.162
the truth about the planets?

18:18.164 --> 18:19.630
I don't think I can.

18:19.632 --> 18:22.400
Why not?
Show her the map.

18:22.402 --> 18:24.969
Oh, good idea,
and when she asks us

18:24.971 --> 18:27.872
where we got it,
then where will we be?

18:27.874 --> 18:30.775
Alright, alright.
So you can't show her the map.

18:30.777 --> 18:34.912
But just because you don't have
any proof that ends it?

18:34.914 --> 18:37.515
I mean,
what's with this planet?

18:37.517 --> 18:40.218
Here's a chance
to open people's minds.

18:40.220 --> 18:44.188
Where are the free thinkers?
The dreamers?

18:44.190 --> 18:46.491
I-I don't know.

18:46.493 --> 18:49.994
But apparently not
in Brian's school.

18:49.996 --> 18:52.697
I-I'm afraid I'm-I'm just
gonna have to go out there

18:52.699 --> 18:55.766
and tell her this has all been
a big mistake.

18:55.768 --> 18:57.635
In other words
you're gonna lie.

19:00.607 --> 19:03.608
- Oh, hi.
- Is everything alright?

19:03.610 --> 19:05.009
Yes, yes, I'm-I'm sorry

19:05.011 --> 19:06.911
to have kept you
waiting so long.

19:06.913 --> 19:09.280
Uh, Mrs. Lyman,
this whole thing has been

19:09.282 --> 19:12.717
a terrible misunderstanding.

19:12.719 --> 19:15.186
I'm so sorry
that this all happened.

19:15.188 --> 19:19.423
So am I. We've never had
any problems with Brian before.

19:19.425 --> 19:20.691
It's just that
this sort of thing

19:20.693 --> 19:23.361
upsets Ms. Larva very much.

19:23.363 --> 19:27.932
Mrs. Lyman, what if we just
displayed the project as it is?

19:27.934 --> 19:31.135
Mr. Tanner, we can't
display a solar system

19:31.137 --> 19:33.604
with two planets
named Dave and Alvin.

19:33.606 --> 19:36.207
It would make a circus
out of our carnival.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.776
Well, we wouldn't
wanna disgrace the clowns.

19:40.780 --> 19:44.415
Look, I'm sure Ms. Larva
would be willing

19:44.417 --> 19:45.917
to meet you halfway.

19:45.919 --> 19:47.485
If Brian removed
the extra planets

19:47.487 --> 19:49.654
I'm sure she would let him
compete with his classmates

19:49.656 --> 19:52.190
and there'd be no harm done.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.892
Yes, yes, there would be.

19:54.894 --> 19:58.963
I..
I can't ask him to do that.

19:58.965 --> 20:01.799
Then I can't ask my teacher
to change her policy.

20:01.801 --> 20:05.036
- Oh, sure you could.
- Alright, I could.

20:05.038 --> 20:06.170
But I won't.

20:06.172 --> 20:09.607
Wait a minute, Mrs. Lyman,
you're an educator.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.275
Surely there's room
in our system

20:11.277 --> 20:13.844
for, for free thinking?

20:13.846 --> 20:15.613
I mean, where would
science be

20:15.615 --> 20:17.215
if there weren't dreamers?

20:17.217 --> 20:19.083
Would-would the Wright Brothers
have flown?

20:19.085 --> 20:22.053
Would-would Galileo have
sailed around the world?

20:22.055 --> 20:24.222
Galileo?

20:24.224 --> 20:25.556
Oh, never mind.

20:25.558 --> 20:27.091
[doorbell dings]

20:28.728 --> 20:30.061
- Mr. William Tanner?
- Yes.

20:30.063 --> 20:32.063
Consumer Ed Boganski.
Nice to meet you.

20:32.065 --> 20:33.731
Let's start with a wide shot
of the whole room.

20:33.733 --> 20:35.833
- No, no, wait.
- Look at that set.

20:35.835 --> 20:38.069
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- Look at that.

20:38.071 --> 20:40.871
- We'll take care of it..
- No.

20:42.208 --> 20:45.209
Hello, I'm at the home
of Mr. William Tanner

20:45.211 --> 20:48.246
who in a desperate
attempt to fight City Hall

20:48.248 --> 20:51.148
has summoned me, Consumer Ed,
to be in his corner.

20:51.150 --> 20:52.750
Stop! Stop!

20:52.752 --> 20:55.720
(Consumer Ed)
Take it easy. This will only
take a minute.

20:55.722 --> 20:58.089
There was no need to involve
the media in this dispute.

20:58.091 --> 21:01.359
Dispute? Dispute? Ma'am, why
don't you give us your side--

21:01.361 --> 21:02.560
No, please, let's..

21:02.562 --> 21:04.362
There's really
nothing to talk about.

21:07.066 --> 21:09.667
Willie, wh-what's going on?

21:09.669 --> 21:12.103
Oh, uh, nothing.
They were just leaving.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.272
- Is this your family?
- That's Consumer Ed.

21:14.274 --> 21:16.240
Could we just
stop for a minute?

21:16.242 --> 21:18.409
You shouldn't have called me
if you didn't wanna talk

21:18.411 --> 21:20.011
about your television.

21:20.013 --> 21:22.913
This is not about
the TV, Mr. Ed.

21:22.915 --> 21:24.915
This is about
the extra planets.

21:24.917 --> 21:26.651
What extra planets?

21:29.155 --> 21:31.622
The two his son claims
exist beyond Pluto.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.424
They do exist.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.826
I mean,
who's to say they don't?

21:35.828 --> 21:37.328
Is that your son?

21:38.231 --> 21:39.297
- No!
- 'Dad!'

21:39.299 --> 21:41.432
I mean, yes, yes.
Of course, he is.

21:41.434 --> 21:43.200
Sid, get a shot
of the kid here.

21:43.202 --> 21:45.970
- Are you putting this on TV?
- No, Brian.

21:45.972 --> 21:48.239
This is great
human interest stuff.

21:48.241 --> 21:51.575
- Please continue, Mr. Tanner.
- Oh, he has nothing to say.

21:51.577 --> 21:53.010
Yes, I do.

21:53.012 --> 21:54.745
My son Brian,
entered a project

21:54.747 --> 21:56.614
in a school
science carnival.

21:56.616 --> 21:58.316
Is that like
a science fair?

21:58.318 --> 21:59.717
Well, this has clowns.

22:00.753 --> 22:02.520
But the school wouldn't
allow the project

22:02.522 --> 22:04.121
to be displayed without..

22:04.123 --> 22:06.357
Without proper credit
to the imagination

22:06.359 --> 22:08.159
of Brian Tanner.

22:08.161 --> 22:09.260
Excuse me?

22:09.262 --> 22:10.995
I'm Brian's principal
and I wanna say

22:10.997 --> 22:13.664
that this is what our science
carnival is all about.

22:13.666 --> 22:15.333
- Free thinking!
- It is?

22:15.335 --> 22:16.667
It is now.

22:16.669 --> 22:18.936
Not to display
Brian's project

22:18.938 --> 22:20.604
would be close-minded.

22:20.606 --> 22:23.074
Does this mean
I can enter my project?

22:23.076 --> 22:24.342
Absolutely.

22:24.344 --> 22:27.345
We encourage open-mindedness
in all of our students.

22:27.347 --> 22:29.747
After all, where would
science be today

22:29.749 --> 22:31.615
if it weren't
for free thinking?

22:31.617 --> 22:34.885
For the dreamers!
Right, Bri?

22:36.022 --> 22:38.756
[instrumental music]

22:44.630 --> 22:47.264
Oh, hurry up, Willie, Brian's
science story is coming on next.

22:47.266 --> 22:50.000
Say, I was just going over
the phone bill and I found--

22:50.002 --> 22:53.571
Save it for later, Willie.
This is Brian's moment.

22:53.573 --> 22:58.909
Do you know someone made
a two-hour phone call to Libya?
