01:05.230 --> 01:07.199
D'oh!

01:27.687 --> 01:29.780
Welcome to the Magic Palace.

01:29.889 --> 01:34.485
- Okay. You can park my car. But no joyriding!
- Mmm.

01:34.594 --> 01:37.757
Wait a minute.

01:45.004 --> 01:48.496
Hello, I'm Questo. I'll be your waiter
and mentalist for this evening.

01:48.608 --> 01:52.669
I'm receiving a drink order.
Something foamy. Is it a "B"-

01:52.779 --> 01:56.340
Beer, yes! How did you know?
Hmm? Ahh.

01:56.449 --> 02:01.978
And for the lady,
a Long Island Iced Tea.

02:02.088 --> 02:04.488
Wow.

02:04.591 --> 02:09.221
Oh, they oughta call that
a"Large" Island Iced Tea.

02:11.231 --> 02:14.792
- No, "Long" is better.
- Are you really gonna drink that?

02:14.901 --> 02:19.531
Well, maybe a sip.
I don't want to offend our mentalist.

02:19.639 --> 02:22.199
If she doesn't like it, I'll just die!

02:22.308 --> 02:24.606
Mmm.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.605
Mmm!

02:29.716 --> 02:32.310
Mom, you're missing a great show.

02:32.418 --> 02:35.285
You don't know what I'm missin'.

02:38.124 --> 02:43.824
Mmm! I'd like to visit that Long Island place,
if only it were real.

02:43.930 --> 02:46.763
Now for my next illusion,
I'll need a volunteer.

02:46.866 --> 02:50.734
I'll do it!
I always end up doing it.

02:51.771 --> 02:55.366
- Hi.
- I'm Diablo. What's your name?

02:55.475 --> 03:00.071
- Marge.
- Okay, Marge. And who's
that gentleman you're with?

03:00.180 --> 03:03.638
That's no gentleman.
That's my husband.

03:06.553 --> 03:10.546
- Wow. Mom got a laugh.
- I wish she drank every day.

03:10.657 --> 03:14.423
Do we love Marge or what?

03:14.527 --> 03:17.496
Oh, please.
I didn't say that for clapping.

03:17.597 --> 03:20.225
- Now, Marge, I have a problem.
- Oh, yeah?

03:20.333 --> 03:23.359
You see, the emperor of China's coming over
and I don't have enough colorful silks.

03:23.469 --> 03:25.369
- Oh.
- So what I need of you is-

03:25.471 --> 03:30.135
You talk too much.
Abraca-blab-ra. Am I right?

03:30.243 --> 03:33.303
See, the ladies know what I'm talking about.

03:33.413 --> 03:38.043
Ha. Ha. Tell you what?
Let's get this ball gag on ya.

03:38.151 --> 03:43.214
There we go.
And we'll skip right ahead to the Kill-O-Tine.

03:43.323 --> 03:45.757
Whoa, baby!

03:47.894 --> 03:50.556
Don't worry, Marge.
You won't feel a thing.

03:50.663 --> 03:52.563
You'll feel four things.

03:52.665 --> 03:55.828
He's very good.

04:05.545 --> 04:07.740
So she was made of chimps.

04:07.847 --> 04:10.372
Man, magic can do anything!

04:10.483 --> 04:12.383
What happened to Mom?

04:12.485 --> 04:16.079
<i>I'm right here!</i>

04:17.290 --> 04:19.724
No! No! Get off of me!

04:19.826 --> 04:22.761
<i>Folks, this is not</i>
<i>part of the act. Please help her.</i>

04:22.862 --> 04:25.922
No! Get 'em off me!
Get 'em off! Get 'em off!

04:27.000 --> 04:30.265
Cool gift shop.
"Ages eight to 80."

04:30.370 --> 04:33.498
Huh. That's me!
Dad, will you get me this magic kit?

04:33.606 --> 04:38.202
Gee, I wish I could, Son.
But we already left the gift shop.

04:38.311 --> 04:41.508
D'oh!

04:41.614 --> 04:45.380
Wow. It's approved by
the Royal Magic College of Hyderabad.

04:45.485 --> 04:48.784
- That's a party magic college.
- It is not.

04:48.888 --> 04:50.014
- Yah-huh.
- Nuh-huh.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.387
- Yah-huh.
- Would you cut it out, you two?

04:52.492 --> 04:55.325
Mommy needs
some quiet right now.

04:58.498 --> 05:00.625
What the hell is that?

05:00.733 --> 05:03.031
It looks like a sturgeon.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.502
But where did it come from?

05:19.352 --> 05:24.051
Hmm. Mm-hmm. Hmm.
Well, there's your problem.

05:24.157 --> 05:26.785
I know that.
How much to fix it?

05:26.893 --> 05:29.555
Oh. Well, that's a foreign fish
we're looking at.

05:29.662 --> 05:32.153
So, uh, 6,500.

05:32.265 --> 05:35.063
- Plus 350.
- Oh, I can't afford that.

05:35.168 --> 05:39.229
Maybe I can make some money, Dad.
The magic act is really coming along.

05:39.339 --> 05:43.605
He couldn't breathe.

05:43.710 --> 05:46.941
<i>Step right up!</i>
<i>See the magic boy!</i>

05:47.046 --> 05:50.709
Witness mystifying feats that
will leave you scratching your head...

05:50.817 --> 05:52.842
until it's raw and bloody!

05:52.952 --> 05:56.479
- Mmm. Look.
- Oh, my goodness!

05:56.589 --> 05:59.786
Come on. Pony up, Flanders.
The kid's not turning tricks for nothin'.

05:59.892 --> 06:03.885
- Oh, no. I could never support the black arts.
- Black arts?

06:03.996 --> 06:06.863
Yeah, you know: Magic,
fortune telling, Oriental cooking.

06:06.966 --> 06:09.491
Hey, you guys!

06:09.602 --> 06:11.502
You're in our spot.

06:11.604 --> 06:14.971
What? Oh, okay, we'll move.
We don't want any trouble, fellas.

06:15.074 --> 06:16.974
Dad, only one of them is real.

06:17.076 --> 06:19.271
- I know, but which one?
- Ohh.

06:21.681 --> 06:25.048
Sixty cents? I would have made more
if I had gone into work today!

06:25.151 --> 06:28.086
Hey, don't blame me.
I gotta compete with TV and the Internet.

06:28.187 --> 06:30.883
A good son would come
through for his dad.

06:30.990 --> 06:33.458
Yeah. And a good dad wouldn't miss
his son's little league games.

06:33.559 --> 06:36.995
I told you!
Lfind them boring!

06:37.096 --> 06:39.963
Well, I showed up for all
your stupid interventions!

06:40.066 --> 06:43.001
Oh, that's it!
You can walk home!

06:48.107 --> 06:51.076
Dad, come back! Ohh.

06:51.177 --> 06:53.236
I can't walk home
with all this stuff.

06:53.346 --> 06:59.080
- Ohh.
- Poor boy. Here's some money for bus fare.

06:59.185 --> 07:03.281
- My father was a monster too.
- Hmm.

07:06.793 --> 07:08.954
Come on, brothers.
Dig deep.

07:10.163 --> 07:15.066
Stupid non-magical son
can't pay to fix my car.

07:15.168 --> 07:18.331
- Hey, Homer! Check it out!
- What the-

07:18.438 --> 07:21.601
Is that a steak?

07:21.707 --> 07:25.143
- Yeah. I know a little place.
- Who gave you all this money?

07:25.244 --> 07:28.179
Mmm, people. I guess they
thought I was a charity case.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.181
Really?

07:30.283 --> 07:33.047
Hey, maybe we could do that again.

07:33.152 --> 07:36.713
Can you look even more pathetic?

07:36.823 --> 07:41.021
Oh, that's beautiful!
We could make a fortune!

07:41.127 --> 07:44.255
But wouldn't that
make us con artists?

07:44.363 --> 07:46.297
Well, yeah.

07:46.399 --> 07:50.495
But God conned me out of
6,500 bucks in car repairs.

07:50.603 --> 07:55.870
So, in a way, we'd just be
balancing out the universe.

07:55.975 --> 08:00.344
There you go!
We'd be stealing from people we know.

08:00.446 --> 08:02.505
It's just like the seasons.

08:02.615 --> 08:05.175
Sounds good.
You want to eat my fat?

08:05.284 --> 08:09.050
I think you know the answer to that.

08:12.625 --> 08:14.616
This book has all the classic cons.

08:14.727 --> 08:17.992
There's the Pigeon Drop,
the Ear Wigger, the Brillstein grab-

08:18.097 --> 08:20.088
Do they have any
father-and-son grifts?

08:20.199 --> 08:23.464
- Well, there's the Albany Ham Scam.
- <i>Interesting.</i>

08:23.569 --> 08:25.730
Oh, wait.
Here we go.

08:28.841 --> 08:33.174
- Oh.
- What are you doing? Why are you
frosting that old throw pillow?

08:33.279 --> 08:35.212
I could ask you
the very same question.

08:35.313 --> 08:38.283
Uh, should I just
back out of the room?

08:38.384 --> 08:42.787
Would you?

08:44.690 --> 08:46.783
Okay, Dad, ready for our first con?

08:46.893 --> 08:49.828
You bet.
Let's trim the mark.

08:49.929 --> 08:51.897
Nice use of the lingo, Homer.

08:51.998 --> 08:55.161
- 10-4, kemosabe.
- Ohh.

08:57.503 --> 09:00.597
I love you too.

09:00.706 --> 09:04.608
Good night and have
a pleasant tomorrow.

09:04.710 --> 09:07.645
- Oh!
- Oh, excuse me.

09:07.747 --> 09:09.647
What happened?
Where's my cake?

09:09.749 --> 09:12.240
- It's all right, isn't it?
- Uh-

09:12.351 --> 09:14.717
What have you done,
you clumsy little ox?

09:14.820 --> 09:17.220
That cake was for your deaf sister!

09:17.323 --> 09:20.554
- Sir, it was my fault.
- No, no. Don't protect him.

09:20.660 --> 09:23.060
You'll work off that cake
in the acid mines!

09:23.162 --> 09:25.062
No! No, no!
I'll pay for the cake.

09:25.164 --> 09:28.133
Well, you're the mark... of integrity.

09:34.307 --> 09:37.276
Wow! Look at all this loot!
What should we buy first?

09:37.376 --> 09:38.343
A singing rubber fish, of course.

09:38.444 --> 09:40.412
There you are.
How was the magic act?

09:40.513 --> 09:42.140
What in the hell
are you talking about?

09:42.248 --> 09:44.944
Oh, right. The magic.

09:45.051 --> 09:48.350
The magic was great!
It's really the way to go.

09:48.454 --> 09:51.218
How'd you do your act?
You left your magic kit here.

09:51.324 --> 09:53.690
Or so it would seem.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.818
Suckers.

09:55.928 --> 09:58.260
I don't know, Mom.
I think they're up to something.

09:58.364 --> 10:00.389
Oh, it sure looks that way.

10:00.499 --> 10:03.627
But at least Bart and Homer
are spending quality time together.

10:03.736 --> 10:06.034
Is that a Long Island Iced Tea?

10:06.138 --> 10:09.938
Oh, this? Hmm.
I think it is.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.073
Mmm. You're a pretty girl.

10:16.182 --> 10:19.276
Here, boy!
Here, doggie!

10:19.385 --> 10:23.321
- Oh, where has my little dog gone?
- Oh, you lost your doggie?

10:23.422 --> 10:26.914
Yeah. I saw him playing in the water,
and then he was gone.

10:27.026 --> 10:29.426
He had a bright red leash
with bells on it.

10:29.528 --> 10:31.519
Oh, I'm sure he's around here
somewhere.

10:33.532 --> 10:36.000
Oh, dear Lord.

10:36.102 --> 10:41.768
He's the bestest dog ever. He's light brown
and he has a spot on him shaped like a heart.

10:41.874 --> 10:45.275
- Sorry, son. But-
- I just gotta get him back!

10:45.378 --> 10:48.506
Or if not him,
a similar dog.

10:48.614 --> 10:50.582
Dog for sale!

10:50.683 --> 10:53.652
Dog for sale!

10:53.753 --> 10:56.745
- How much for the dog?
- Oh, he's not for sale.

10:56.856 --> 11:01.884
- Oh, well.
- Although, if the right offer came along-

11:05.998 --> 11:09.229
Here's for the repairs
and a little extra for you.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.235
Hey. Thanks, chief.

11:11.337 --> 11:14.238
Uhh! My bar mitzvah cake!

11:14.340 --> 11:16.808
Oy! I'll never be a man.

11:16.909 --> 11:18.877
Uhh.

11:18.978 --> 11:20.707
- Dad?
- Yeah, Son?

11:20.813 --> 11:25.216
Why are we still grifting? The car's paid for.
Doesn't that balance out the universe?

11:25.317 --> 11:28.047
In a way. But I also remembered
some other stuff.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.486
Like my bike that
was stolen in third grade.

11:30.589 --> 11:33.080
- Plus the baldness.
- Okay. I'm sold.

11:35.294 --> 11:37.387
Hello.
Is the lady of the house in?

11:37.496 --> 11:41.364
Oh, no! Homer, remember?
Maudie got called up to heaven.

11:41.467 --> 11:46.063
- Oh. Of course. Of course. It's just that-
- What?

11:46.172 --> 11:50.131
Well, before she died, she ordered
this Bible especially for you.

11:50.242 --> 11:53.268
Why, there's my name, in gold.

11:53.379 --> 11:57.213
Now you weren't home,
so we had to pay the delivery man.

11:57.316 --> 11:59.045
Well, I'll just reimburse you right-

11:59.151 --> 12:04.088
Wait a minute. This seems an awful lot
like that movie <i>Paper Moon.</i>

12:04.190 --> 12:08.251
- Run, Dad!
- Okay!

12:08.360 --> 12:10.920
- We'll be safe in here.
- That was too close.

12:11.030 --> 12:12.930
- Maybe it's time to quit the game.
- <i>Amateurs!</i>

12:13.032 --> 12:14.932
- Huh?
- Dad?

12:15.034 --> 12:17.867
That's right.

12:17.970 --> 12:23.237
- You don't smoke a pipe.
- That's right.

12:23.342 --> 12:26.072
- How'd you get wise to us?
- Are you kiddin'?

12:26.178 --> 12:28.840
They used to call me Grifty McGrift.

12:28.948 --> 12:31.075
I wrote the book on flimflammin'.

12:31.183 --> 12:33.845
Wow! He did!

12:33.953 --> 12:37.912
Yeah. In the Depression, you had to grift.
Either that or work.

12:38.023 --> 12:41.015
- So what's the pitch, old man?
- Team up with me, boys...

12:41.127 --> 12:44.563
and we'll go for the biggest
honey pot of'em all!

12:47.099 --> 12:50.500
Oh, my God!

12:50.603 --> 12:53.163
I don't know.
Fleecin' old people?

12:53.272 --> 12:57.834
Oh, why not? If we don't take their money,
they'll just give it to some televangelist.

12:57.943 --> 13:00.912
Let's dust a few fossils.

13:01.013 --> 13:06.918
Now this scam was in <i>The Sting, Part Two,</i>
so nobody knows about it.

13:07.019 --> 13:08.987
Now as I recall, Jackie Gleason-

13:12.358 --> 13:16.761
- Which one of you youngsters is Abe Simpson?
- I'm Abe Simpson.

13:16.862 --> 13:21.993
You've just won $10 million
from that publisher's "cleary-dealie"!

13:22.101 --> 13:26.868
- What?
- Everybody, come quick! Abe Simpson is rich!

13:26.972 --> 13:28.872
I can't believe it!

13:28.974 --> 13:33.240
I can finally afford
a young, crazy, stripper wife.

13:33.345 --> 13:38.647
Yeah. I'm gonna get me the craziest, "strippiest"-

13:42.855 --> 13:44.982
He's dead.

13:45.090 --> 13:48.491
Oh, this is terrible.
Now who do we give the money to?

13:48.594 --> 13:51.119
I guess we'll just have to haul
the check back to headquarters.

13:51.230 --> 13:53.664
Too bad we couldn't just give it
to these nice folks.

13:53.766 --> 13:57.862
Forget it, Ed. Do you know what
it costs to sign over a check this big?

13:57.970 --> 14:01.599
Why, the wealth transfer fee would run
at least a hundred dollars a head.

14:01.707 --> 14:04.005
You're right. We better just
take this check back for shredding.

14:04.109 --> 14:08.273
No, wait. We got a hundred bucks each.
Hang on.

14:13.018 --> 14:14.918
Thank you.
No shoving.

14:15.020 --> 14:18.547
That's right. Put your money in here.
All of it. Is that everyone?

14:18.657 --> 14:22.650
What's your problem, sport?
Afraid to be rich?

14:22.761 --> 14:26.925
Hold your horses.
I'll get to ya!

14:27.032 --> 14:30.001
F.B.I. You're under arrest for fraud.

14:33.072 --> 14:35.472
Mm-hmm.

14:35.574 --> 14:38.407
Throw the book at him, sonny.
D'oh!

14:38.510 --> 14:41.445
Now, where's the inside man?

14:41.547 --> 14:43.447
Mmm?

14:43.549 --> 14:47.576
Call me mint jelly,
'cause I'm on the lam! Ahh!

14:51.490 --> 14:54.084
So we're under arrest for fraud?

14:54.193 --> 14:56.821
Yes, fraud.

15:03.002 --> 15:05.971
Well, this is about the flashiest car
I've ever impounded.

15:06.071 --> 15:09.871
Thanks. Whew!
It took a lot of grifting. Ooh!

15:09.975 --> 15:14.241
Please, F.B.I. Man, don't throw us in jail.
We just made one mistake.

15:14.346 --> 15:18.282
Yeah. We're not criminals.
We're just two crazy, mixed-up kids.

15:20.019 --> 15:22.419
Mmm. Okay, tell you what.

15:22.521 --> 15:25.718
I'll let you turn yourselves in.
Maybe they'll go easier on you.

15:25.824 --> 15:29.783
- You'd do that for us?
- Well, I did ruin the boy's birthday cake.

15:29.895 --> 15:32.056
Go on in.
But I'll be watching!

15:32.164 --> 15:35.156
Okay. Thank you, sir.

15:35.267 --> 15:37.735
Don't worry, Son.
I have an idea.

15:37.836 --> 15:41.431
Chief, I'd like to
scare my son straight.

15:41.540 --> 15:43.804
Could I show him a jail cell?

15:43.909 --> 15:48.437
Oh, sure. I'll put you in the RickJames suite.
It's super freaky.

15:53.419 --> 15:55.614
Okay, we're all locked up now.

15:55.721 --> 15:58.053
Yeah. You big idiot.

15:58.157 --> 16:02.423
- Excellent. I guess I'll just be swiping your car now.
- What?

16:02.528 --> 16:06.089
Oh, and this lovely bag of cash.

16:06.198 --> 16:09.133
So long, suckers!
Woo-hoo!

16:11.403 --> 16:16.340
- That's not an F.B.I. Badge.
- "Colgate Cavity Patrol"? Ohh!

16:16.442 --> 16:19.536
- That guy was a grifter.
- Yeah. He conned us good.

16:19.645 --> 16:22.443
Well, at least we still have our jobs
at the sweepstakes place.

16:22.548 --> 16:23.845
- Ohh!
- What?

16:23.949 --> 16:25.849
Mom's gonna wonder
where the car went.

16:25.951 --> 16:30.479
- We better have a good story.
- Well, lies got us into this mess, Son.

16:30.589 --> 16:32.955
From now on,
it's honesty all the way.

16:33.058 --> 16:36.425
You were carjacked
in the church parking lot?

16:36.528 --> 16:41.727
Absolutely. We had stopped in for a quick prayer
when- Bart, would you call him a crazy man?

16:41.834 --> 16:44.530
Definitely.
Well, crazy about carjacking.

16:44.636 --> 16:48.128
- What did he look like?
- Uh, mmm, let's see.

16:48.240 --> 16:51.641
He was foreign, and he had-

16:51.744 --> 16:55.202
- Wild, bushy hair, like an animal.
- Anything else?

16:55.314 --> 16:58.772
Uh, well, he seemed like a loner.
Kept to himself mostly.

16:58.884 --> 17:01.682
And he said if we went to the cops,
he'd come back for Maggie.

17:01.787 --> 17:04.654
Oh, dear! We don't want that!

17:04.757 --> 17:08.921
Anyhoo, the whole nightmare's
really made us sleepy.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.996
Let's hit the hay.

17:12.731 --> 17:14.631
Homie! Homie, wake up!

17:14.733 --> 17:18.191
- They've captured your crazed foreign carjacker!
- Huh?

17:18.303 --> 17:23.002
- But that's impossible.
- They're arresting him right now.

17:23.108 --> 17:26.509
- I did not do it, I tell ya!
- Uh-oh.

17:26.612 --> 17:30.412
At least, let me comb me hair.
It's all wild and bushy.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.416
What do you care, Loner.

17:32.518 --> 17:36.147
Well, look at that.
But who called the police?

17:36.255 --> 17:39.554
- We did.
- After we got Maggie to a safe house, of course.

17:39.658 --> 17:43.287
Hmm.
She hasn't touched her Manwich.

17:43.395 --> 17:45.590
You cannot do this to Willie!

17:45.697 --> 17:47.631
I'm innocent, I tell ya!

17:47.733 --> 17:51.032
They always say they're innocent.
It's such a turnoff.

17:51.136 --> 17:53.263
Dad, Willie got arrested 'cause of us!

17:53.372 --> 17:57.308
Of course he did, Son. He's a filthy crook.
Now let's all hit the hay.

17:57.409 --> 17:59.309
It's 10:00 in the morning.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.175
I guess you haven't
heard of chloroform.

18:06.452 --> 18:11.355
Will you tell the court your whereabouts
at the time of the carjacking?

18:11.457 --> 18:13.925
I was alone in me
Unabomber-style shack.

18:14.026 --> 18:16.221
I had nothing to do
with that carjacking.

18:16.328 --> 18:20.856
Carjacking? Who said anything
about a carjacking?

18:20.966 --> 18:23.332
But didn't ya just say-

18:23.435 --> 18:26.632
- I'll ask the questions here, Carjacker Willie!
- Objection!

18:26.738 --> 18:29.935
I'm gonna allow it. It characterizes
the defendant as a carjacker.

18:30.042 --> 18:34.570
- Dad, we've gotta tell everyone the truth.
- Let's see how this plays out.

18:34.680 --> 18:39.049
Mr. Simpson, could you
describe your assailant to the court?

18:39.151 --> 18:43.417
I told you my memory is fuzzy. Fuzzy!

18:43.522 --> 18:46.821
Fuzzy like Willie's beard?

18:46.925 --> 18:51.794
Yes! Exactly! No, no. I mean
the whole incident is hazy.

18:51.897 --> 18:55.162
Hazy like the moors of Scotland?

18:55.267 --> 18:58.395
Yes, exactly!

18:58.504 --> 19:00.665
Ohh!

19:03.108 --> 19:06.441
Hey! Mountain Dew? Ohh!

19:10.682 --> 19:13.276
Mr. Foreman,
has the jury reached a verdict?

19:13.385 --> 19:18.880
I believe
we was promised $5.00 a day.

19:18.991 --> 19:22.552
All right then. Guilty!

19:22.661 --> 19:26.620
<i>Carjacker Willie, I sentence you</i>
<i>to 10 years in prison!</i>

19:28.867 --> 19:32.234
- Dad, tell them!
- When the time is right.

19:32.337 --> 19:34.931
Ten years?
But I "didna" do it!

19:35.040 --> 19:38.840
- Sure you "didna." Now let's get you to Attica-
- No!

19:41.246 --> 19:43.009
You'll never send me up the river!

19:43.115 --> 19:46.414
- Dad.
- Let's see where he's going with this.

19:49.454 --> 19:51.718
Willie, as your employer, I insist-

19:51.823 --> 19:54.758
Oh!

19:54.860 --> 19:57.954
Stop! This has gone on
just long enough!

19:58.063 --> 19:59.963
Nobody carjacked me.

20:00.065 --> 20:03.193
I tried to pull a con
and got conned myself.

20:03.302 --> 20:06.271
And then I lied to you all.

20:10.509 --> 20:14.070
So did Bart.

20:14.179 --> 20:17.910
Okay, players, that's a wrap!

20:20.252 --> 20:21.685
Huh?

20:21.787 --> 20:26.247
- Nice work, everybody.
- Wait a minute. This whole thing was a setup?

20:26.358 --> 20:29.259
But Skinner got shot. Aah!

20:29.361 --> 20:31.625
Yup. Blanks and a blood pack.

20:31.730 --> 20:35.188
- Hey, watch it!
- I look like cable TV.

20:35.300 --> 20:36.995
What about that bullet hole
in your hair?

20:37.102 --> 20:39.366
Squibs.

20:39.471 --> 20:43.271
Yeah, we hornswoggled you good.

20:43.375 --> 20:45.275
But what about the guy
who took my car?

20:47.379 --> 20:51.873
Devon Bradley. Character actor,
dancer, singer. I'm a triple threat!

20:51.984 --> 20:54.248
He's doing <i>Dreamcoat</i>
at the dinner theater.

20:54.353 --> 20:57.322
- I can't believe everyone was in on it.
- Willie wasn't!

21:03.862 --> 21:06.831
Wait a minute. You're telling me
the police force, the TV news...

21:06.932 --> 21:08.866
a courthouse full of people,
and a popular entertainer...

21:08.967 --> 21:10.867
had nothing better to do than
to teach me and Bart a lesson?

21:10.936 --> 21:12.904
I know it seems far-fetched,
even insulting to your intelligence.

21:13.005 --> 21:16.941
But there's a simple and highly
satisfying explanation. You see-

21:17.042 --> 21:19.272
Hey, everybody!
Surf s up!

21:22.414 --> 21:25.076
- Cowabunga!
- Woo!

21:25.183 --> 21:28.084
Uh! Uh!

21:31.189 --> 21:33.453
Hey!

21:33.558 --> 21:35.458
Ohh!

21:35.560 --> 21:37.528
- Hey!
- Aah!

22:25.177 --> 22:27.145
Shh!
