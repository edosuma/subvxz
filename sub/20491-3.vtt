02:42.534 --> 02:46.567
YEAH, AND HOW
FAST CAN WE KILL IT?

02:46.667 --> 02:48.367
UH, IT WAS AN EMERGENCY ALARM.

02:48.467 --> 02:50.934
IT'S COMING THROUGH
ADAM'S PRIVATE FREQUENCY.

02:51.033 --> 02:52.567
WHAT KIND OF EMERGENCY?

02:52.667 --> 02:53.801
I DON'T KNOW.

02:53.901 --> 02:54.968
BUT I'M GUESSING
HE'S ABOUT TO TELL US.

02:55.067 --> 02:56.901
<i>ADAM, YOU WERE RIGHT.</i>

02:57.000 --> 02:58.467
<i>WE SHOULDN'T
HAVE GOTTEN INVOLVED.</i>

02:58.567 --> 03:01.000
<i>THIS PROJECT'S
GOTTEN OUT OF CONTROL.</i>

03:01.100 --> 03:03.000
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?

03:03.100 --> 03:04.968
WHAT PROJECT? WHERE ARE YOU?

03:05.067 --> 03:06.334
HE CAN'T HEAR YOU.

03:06.434 --> 03:07.968
IT'S A ONE-WAY DISTRESS CALL.

03:08.067 --> 03:09.400
<i>I'M SENDING YOU A VIDEO</i>

03:09.501 --> 03:10.567
<i>ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING
ON THE BASE AROUND ME.</i>

03:10.667 --> 03:13.000
<i>IT'S HORRIBLE.</i>

03:13.100 --> 03:15.734
WHAT THE HELL...?

03:15.834 --> 03:22.801
<i>ADAM, PLEASE, I NEED YOUR HELP.</i>

03:25.334 --> 03:27.667
WHAT JUST HAPPENED?

03:27.767 --> 03:30.567
TRANSMISSION'S
BEEN CUT AT THE SOURCE.

03:30.667 --> 03:33.567
WE'VE LOST HIM.

03:43.501 --> 03:45.067
<i>SCIENTIST ADAM KANE.</i>

03:45.167 --> 03:47.634
<i>WAS A PIONEER
OF GENETIC RESEARCH,</i>

03:47.734 --> 03:50.834
<i>MANIPULATING DNA
TO SAVE HUMAN LIVES.</i>

03:50.934 --> 03:56.767
<i>BUT IN MANY, THEIR
GENES UNEXPECTEDLY MUTATED.</i>

03:56.868 --> 04:00.033
<i>THEY DEVELOPED
SUPER-HUMAN ABILITIES.</i>

04:02.801 --> 04:26.334
* *

04:26.434 --> 04:28.501
<i>TOGETHER FOUR
OF THE MOST POWERFUL</i>

04:28.601 --> 04:33.968
<i>FIGHT TO PROTECT A WORLD THAT
DOESN'T EVEN KNOW THEY EXIST.</i>

04:34.067 --> 04:37.601
<i>THEY ARE... MUTANT X.</i>

04:43.734 --> 04:45.033
DR. VINCENT ARRIGO...

04:45.133 --> 04:46.834
...HE'S ANOTHER
EX-GENOMEX ALUMNI.

04:46.934 --> 04:49.801
WHEN GENOMEX FOLDED, ADAM
PULLED SOME STRINGS TO GET HIM

04:49.901 --> 04:51.701
INTO THE ARMY'S
BIO-RESEARCH DIVISION.

04:51.801 --> 04:53.701
HE'S STATIONED AT FORT PERRY.

04:53.801 --> 04:56.000
IT'S A MILITARY
MEDICAL INSTALLATION.

04:56.100 --> 04:59.133
LET ME GUESS:
GENE-BASED RESEARCH?

04:59.234 --> 05:00.834
TEN POINTS.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.801
HIS WORK IS MAJORLY CLASSIFIED.

05:02.901 --> 05:05.100
I'M TALKING LEVEL 6 CLEARANCE.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.934
I CAN'T EVEN SEE
THE WORK HE'S BEEN DOING.

05:07.033 --> 05:09.634
TRY GERM WARFARE.

05:09.734 --> 05:11.567
IT'S SAFE
TO ASSUME THAT WHATEVER
ARRIGO AND HIS TEAM WERE

05:11.667 --> 05:14.100
WORKING ON ISN'T
A NEW COLD AND FLU REMEDY.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.000
WELL, WHAT DID YOU FIND?

05:16.100 --> 05:18.200
MY CONTACTS TELL ME IT'S A
NEW FORM OF A WEAPONIZED PLAGUE.

05:18.300 --> 05:20.267
OTHER THAN THAT, THEY'RE
COMPLETELY IN THE DARK.

05:20.367 --> 05:22.634
THE MILITARY'S BLOCKING ALL
COMMUNICATIONS WITHIN THE BASE.

05:22.734 --> 05:26.000
THEY WANT US TO ANSWER
THAT DISTRESS SIGNAL.

05:26.100 --> 05:27.467
WHOA, HO,
HANG ON HERE.

05:27.567 --> 05:29.133
PLAGUE EXTERMINATOR?

05:29.234 --> 05:30.934
NOT IN MY JOB DESCRIPTION.

05:31.033 --> 05:32.801
YEAH,
BRENNAN'S RIGHT.

05:32.901 --> 05:34.634
I MEAN,
WHY AREN'T THEY CALLING IN
CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL?

05:34.734 --> 05:37.100
BECAUSE IF THE
ARMY ASKS FOR OUTSIDE HELP
THEY ADMIT CULPABILITY.

05:37.200 --> 05:39.601
THEY HAVE TO HAND OVER WHATEVER
CLASSIFIED RESEARCH RELATES.

05:39.701 --> 05:41.501
THAT'S NEVER GONNA HAPPEN.

05:41.601 --> 05:43.634
SHE'S RIGHT.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.534
RIGHT NOW, DR. ARRIGO'S
OUR ONLY CHANCE.

05:45.634 --> 05:47.767
HE IS SMACK DAB IN
THE MIDDLE OF GROUND ZERO.

05:47.868 --> 05:49.234
YEAH, AND WHAT
IF HE'S ALREADY DEAD?

05:51.033 --> 05:53.400
THERE'S ONLY
ONE WAY TO FIND OUT.

05:57.601 --> 05:59.367
SO WHAT'S THE PLAN ONCE WE LAND?

05:59.467 --> 06:01.634
WELL, TAKE THE MOST
DIRECT ROUTE TO ARRIGO'S LAB.

06:01.734 --> 06:03.334
DO NOT PASS GO.

06:03.434 --> 06:06.434
AND DO NOT GET CORNERED
BY WHATEVER IT WAS WE SAW
IN THAT VIDEO LINK.

06:06.534 --> 06:08.567
GOOD STRATEGY.

06:08.667 --> 06:12.434
SO, YOU THINK ARRIGO IS GONNA
FIX WHATEVER IT IS HE OPENED UP?

06:12.534 --> 06:14.734
WELL, IF HE'S
THE ONE THAT OPENED IT,

06:14.834 --> 06:18.400
HE'S GOT THE BEST
CHANCE OF DEALING WITH IT.

06:18.501 --> 06:20.467
ALL RIGHT, FORT
PERRY DEAD AHEAD.

06:23.667 --> 06:25.968
SHAL, WHAT YOU
GOT ON THE SENSORS?

06:26.067 --> 06:28.200
WELL, THERE'S
A HEAVY MILITARY PRESENCE
ALL AROUND THE PERIMETER.

06:28.300 --> 06:33.200
AND... IT LOOKS
LIKE THE BASE IS CIRCLED BY
SOME SORT OF ENERGY FENCE.

06:33.300 --> 06:35.000
HIGH-TECH QUARANTINE.

06:35.100 --> 06:37.200
CAN WE LAND INSIDE
THE INSTALLATION?

06:37.300 --> 06:38.734
IT'S RISKY.

06:38.834 --> 06:40.234
AS SOON AS WE GET
CLOSE ENOUGH TO LAND,

06:40.334 --> 06:42.067
IT'LL PROBABLY
FRY OUT OUR NAV SYSTEMS.

06:42.167 --> 06:44.234
HUH, LOOKS LIKE WE'RE
GOING IN THE FRONT DOOR.

06:46.968 --> 06:48.901
ALL RIGHT, I'M TAKING
HER OUT OF STEALTH.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.901
I'M GUESSING THESE MILITARY
TYPES WOULDN'T LOOK SO KINDLY

06:51.000 --> 06:53.167
UPON US JUST APPEARING
OUT OF THIN AIR.

06:54.901 --> 06:56.200
GUYS?

06:56.300 --> 06:58.934
BEING HAILED ON BROADBAND.

06:59.033 --> 07:00.634
<i>UNIDENTIFIED CRAFT:</i>

07:00.734 --> 07:04.067
<i>YOU'RE ENTERING RESTRICTED
MILITARY AIRSPACE.</i>

07:04.167 --> 07:07.634
<i>LAND IMMEDIATELY
OR BE CONSIDERED HOSTILE.</i>

07:07.734 --> 07:11.033
COPY THAT.
WE'RE COMING IN.

07:11.133 --> 07:13.033
SO IF ANY OF YOUR
BUDDIES HAVE MILITARY PULL,

07:13.133 --> 07:14.901
NOW MIGHT
BE A REAL GOOD TIME...

07:15.000 --> 07:17.133
I'M ON IT.

07:28.267 --> 07:30.868
ALL WE'RE
ASKING FOR IS ENTRY.

07:30.968 --> 07:33.801
YOU'RE IN NO POSITION TO ASK
ME WHAT I HAD FOR BREAKFAST,

07:33.901 --> 07:36.467
LET ALONE
BREACH MY QUARANTINE.

07:36.567 --> 07:38.868
I'LL DO THIS ONE MORE
TIME: WHO DO YOU WORK FOR?

07:38.968 --> 07:40.534
HOW DID
YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS?

07:40.634 --> 07:43.501
AND WHO ELSE KNOWS?

07:43.601 --> 07:44.901
FINE.

07:45.000 --> 07:48.534
I WANT THEM RESTRAINED.

07:48.634 --> 07:49.501
<PHONE RING>

07:49.601 --> 07:51.334
OH, HEY, HEY, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

07:51.434 --> 07:53.467
WAIT UP - YOU
MIGHT WANT TO GET THIS.

07:53.567 --> 07:55.400
IT'S FOR YOU.

07:55.501 --> 07:58.200
THIS IS MAJOR GENERAL KLEIN.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.634
YES, SIR.

08:00.734 --> 08:03.234
I'D PAY BIG MONEY TO
TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR ROLODEX.

08:03.334 --> 08:05.400
THAT'S WHAT
ALL THE BOYS SAY.

08:10.834 --> 08:13.334
I UNDERSTAND, SIR.

08:19.133 --> 08:21.467
IT SEEMS I'M TO
GIVE YOU COOPERATION.

08:21.567 --> 08:23.534
GOOD.

08:23.634 --> 08:27.601
SO, WHAT STEPS ARE BEING
TAKEN TO REVERSE THE INFECTION?

08:27.701 --> 08:29.901
MILITARY DOCTORS
ARE WORKING OFF-SITE.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.900
WE'RE RUNNING
A STRAIGHT "QUARANTINE AND
CONTAINMENT" OP OUT HERE.

08:33.000 --> 08:36.299
SURE WE DON'T NEED
SOME SORT OF PROTECTIVE
MASKS OR HAZMAT SUITS?

08:36.400 --> 08:38.133
IT ISN'T AIRBORNE.

08:38.234 --> 08:42.534
TRANSMISSION REQUIRES
CONTACT THROUGH BROKEN SKIN -
BITES, SCRATCHES.

08:42.634 --> 08:45.300
SO KEEP YOUR DISTANCE
FROM ANYONE INFECTED.

08:45.400 --> 08:49.701
YOU CAN COUNT ON THAT.

08:52.334 --> 08:54.067
OKAY, LET'S BE
CLEAR ON ONE LAST THING.

08:54.167 --> 08:56.801
YOUR CONNECTION'S GOT
YOU AN ENTRY PASS, NOT AN EXIT.

08:56.901 --> 09:00.133
ONCE INSIDE, YOU
ALL BECOME CONTAGION RISKS.

09:00.234 --> 09:03.367
YOU'LL BE CONSIDERED QUARANTINED
- JUST LIKE THE REST.

09:03.467 --> 09:05.133
UNDERSTOOD?

09:05.234 --> 09:07.000
UNDERSTOOD.

09:12.934 --> 09:15.033
CHEERY LITTLE
GUY, ISN'T HE?

09:15.133 --> 09:18.534
I DON'T KNOW IF I
LIKE GOING IN THERE KNOWING
HE'S OUR ONLY WAY OUT.

09:18.634 --> 09:21.601
WELL,
ONE OF US IS GOING TO
HAVE TO STAY BEHIND, THEN.

09:21.701 --> 09:24.434
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO,
NO. ABSOLUTELY NOT.

09:24.534 --> 09:26.634
JESS... COME ON, WE'RE
OUTNUMBERED IN THERE AS IT IS.

09:26.734 --> 09:30.067
WELL, THEN ONE LESS WON'T
MAKE THAT MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE.

09:30.167 --> 09:32.133
LOOK, THE HELIX IS LINKED
TO YOUR SYSTEMS IN SANCTUARY.

09:32.234 --> 09:33.934
YOU'LL BE MORE
HELP IF YOU STAY WITH IT.

09:34.033 --> 09:35.868
FINE.

09:35.968 --> 09:37.400
GOOD.

09:37.501 --> 09:39.133
LISTEN, FIND OUT ABOUT
THE CONTAINMENT MEASURES,

09:39.234 --> 09:41.701
AND SEE
IF THERE'S ANY BACKDOOR
EXIT - IN CASE WE NEED IT.

09:41.801 --> 09:44.033
START WITH THAT FENCE.

09:50.801 --> 09:53.300
KILL SECTION NINE.

09:56.067 --> 09:59.300
HERE WE GO. WISH US LUCK.

10:02.100 --> 10:03.834
LUCK...

10:32.734 --> 10:34.701
AH, IT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.

10:38.634 --> 10:40.267
HOW FAR ARE WE FROM ARRIGO?

10:40.367 --> 10:42.734
HIS LAB SHOULD
BE IN THE MAIN BUILDING.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.234
WHAT'S UP, SHAL?

11:09.334 --> 11:14.167
THAT SMELL.
IT'S LIKE... ROTTING...

11:14.267 --> 11:16.868
INFECTED FLESH,
OR SOMETHING.

11:16.968 --> 11:19.801
NOW, THERE'S A REASON
I'M GLAD I'M NOT FERAL.

11:19.901 --> 11:23.801
CAN YOU TRACK IT?

11:23.901 --> 11:25.167
THERE.

11:27.868 --> 11:29.868
GET OUT OF HERE! RUN!

11:42.267 --> 11:43.367
GO! GO!

11:43.467 --> 11:45.601
COME ON.

11:48.167 --> 11:51.734
YOU GOT TWO HUNDRED
AND FIFTY THOUSAND VOLTS
RUNNING THROUGH THAT FENCE.

11:51.834 --> 11:53.501
WHERE ARE
YOU GETTING THE JUICE?

11:53.601 --> 11:56.567
WE'VE DIVERTED
EVERY BIT OF POWER FROM THE
INSTALLATION TO THE FENCE.

11:56.667 --> 11:58.801
NOTHING'S GONNA
GET THROUGH THERE.

11:58.901 --> 12:02.534
MAYBE I COULD TAKE
A LOOK AT THOSE SCHEMATICS
JUST TO MAKE SURE.

12:02.634 --> 12:05.334
THE FENCE
SPECS ARE CLASSIFIED.

12:05.434 --> 12:08.567
YOUR TEAM TOOK A BIG RISK
GOING IN THERE ON THEIR OWN.

12:08.667 --> 12:10.634
THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

12:10.734 --> 12:14.567
WHAT MAKES THEM
THINK THEY CAN SUCCEED WHERE
OUR RESOURCES HAVE FAILED?

12:14.667 --> 12:19.767
WELL, LET'S JUST
SAY WE'VE GOT SOME PRETTY
UNIQUE RESOURCES OF OUR OWN.

12:19.868 --> 12:21.968
SUCH AS?

12:22.067 --> 12:24.167
THAT'S CLASSIFIED.

12:27.701 --> 12:30.000
JUST MAKE SURE YOU
OBEY THE QUARANTINE ORDERS

12:30.100 --> 12:35.234
AND YOU WON'T HAVE ANY PROBLEMS.

12:38.968 --> 12:41.434
I DON'T
THINK THERE'S ANYONE LEFT TO
ROLL OUT THE WELCOME WAGON.

12:41.534 --> 12:45.100
I HOPE YOU'RE WRONG.

12:46.767 --> 12:50.601
WHATEVER WE DO,
WE HAD BETTER DO IT FAST.

12:53.033 --> 12:55.033
OKAY, NOW WOULD
BE A GOOD TIME, BRENNAN.

12:59.601 --> 13:01.400
DON'T FRY IT. WE NEED
TO LOCK IT BEHIND US.

13:01.501 --> 13:03.267
JUST LET ME WORK HERE, HUH?

13:04.501 --> 13:07.167
GO, GO, GO!

13:15.868 --> 13:18.133
JUST SO YOU KNOW, THERE'S
PROBABLY JUST AS MANY INFECTED

13:18.234 --> 13:20.901
INSIDE AS THERE ARE OUTSIDE.

13:21.000 --> 13:22.300
OH, GREAT.

13:22.400 --> 13:23.934
JUST WHEN I WAS STARTING
TO FEEL ALL WARM AND FUZZY.

13:32.767 --> 13:38.667
THEY'RE ONTO US.
THEY CAN PROBABLY SMELL
PEOPLE WHO AREN'T INFECTED.

13:39.934 --> 13:41.467
ARRIGO'S LAB SHOULD
BE AROUND THE CORNER.

13:41.567 --> 13:43.434
GO.

14:00.734 --> 14:03.234
DR. ARRIGO, LET US IN.

14:03.334 --> 14:04.968
<i>WHO ARE YOU?</i>

14:05.067 --> 14:07.567
WE GOT THE MESSAGE YOU SENT.

14:07.667 --> 14:09.801
ADAM SENT YOU?

14:09.901 --> 14:10.968
YES.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.601
GUYS?

14:13.634 --> 14:16.334
JUST LET US IN.

14:20.601 --> 14:24.200
I DIDN'T KNOW IF ANYONE
HAD RECEIVED THE MESSAGE.

14:25.434 --> 14:27.868
ALL RIGHT, YOU WANT TO
TELL US WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

14:27.968 --> 14:30.367
IT'S PRETTY COMPLICATED
GENETIC THEORY.

14:30.467 --> 14:31.968
WELL, TRY US.

14:32.067 --> 14:35.968
MY FIELD IS
BEHAVIORAL SHADOWING.

14:36.067 --> 14:38.534
IT'S A RARE PHENOMENON
WHERE PARASITES ACTUALLY CONTROL

14:38.634 --> 14:41.167
THEIR HOSTS, INSTEAD
OF FEEDING OFF OF THEM.

14:41.267 --> 14:44.234
LIKE LITTLE
PUPPET-MASTERS.

14:44.334 --> 14:46.901
SO FAR, IT'S ONLY BEEN
PROVEN TO OCCUR WITH THE LOWER

14:47.000 --> 14:49.834
SPECIES - SPIDERS, RATS.

14:49.934 --> 14:53.467
OUR DIRECTIVE WAS TO
CREATE A PARASITE THAT WOULD

14:53.567 --> 14:56.501
INFLUENCE HUMAN BEHAVIOUR.

14:56.601 --> 15:01.000
ALLOW US TO GAIN
CONTROL OVER AN ENTIRE ENEMY
FORCE JUST BY INFECTING IT.

15:01.100 --> 15:02.267
THAT'S POSSIBLE?

15:02.367 --> 15:05.067
IT'S HAPPENING.
RIGHT NOW, ON THIS BASE.

15:07.067 --> 15:09.868
LET ME SHOW YOU.

15:17.734 --> 15:20.601
THE PARASITE WE DESIGNED
SECRETES A NEURAL CHEMICAL THAT

15:20.701 --> 15:22.901
TRIGGERS HYPER AGGRESSION.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.367
OH, WHAT? YOU JUST INFECT
ONE OF THEM AND THEN
SIT BACK AND WATCH AS

15:26.467 --> 15:27.868
THEY INFECT EACH OTHER?

15:27.968 --> 15:31.033
WE COULD WIN A WAR
WITHOUT FIRING A SINGLE SHOT.

15:31.133 --> 15:33.868
IT WAS BRILLIANT.

15:36.033 --> 15:39.067
IT'S INSANE.

15:39.167 --> 15:43.701
WHAT WENT WRONG?

15:43.801 --> 15:46.634
SHE DID.

15:46.734 --> 15:48.901
I BLAME MYSELF.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.100
MY ASSISTANT RACHEL
ACCIDENTALLY INFECTED HERSELF

15:52.200 --> 15:54.300
BEFORE WE COULD
DEVELOP AN ANTIDOTE.

16:00.367 --> 16:02.167
UGH!

16:04.901 --> 16:06.300
HEY, YOU OKAY?

16:06.400 --> 16:11.868
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO ME?

16:16.033 --> 16:17.067
TIE HIM DOWN.

16:17.167 --> 16:18.534
TIE HIM DOWN - NOW!

16:18.634 --> 16:19.968
HE'S INFECTED.

16:20.067 --> 16:21.234
COME ON, NOW.

16:21.334 --> 16:22.634
MOVE IT! MOVE IT!

16:22.734 --> 16:23.734
HE'S RIGHT. HE'S RIGHT.

16:23.834 --> 16:25.133
DO IT. DO IT.

16:25.234 --> 16:28.067
LET'S GO!

16:31.834 --> 16:34.501
WAIT, WAIT. YOU
HAVE TO HELP THE OTHERS.

16:34.601 --> 16:39.000
LISTEN TO ME. LISTEN TO ME.

16:39.100 --> 16:45.100
FOR ALL OUR SAKES, KILL ME.

16:45.200 --> 16:49.968
PLEASE... JUST... KILL ME.

16:59.601 --> 17:02.067
WERE YOU
TRYING TO GET OUT?

17:02.167 --> 17:05.601
NO. WOMAN I WAS HIDING WITH
FELL INTO DIABETIC SHOCK.

17:05.701 --> 17:08.367
I VOLUNTEERED TO GO GET INSULIN.

17:08.467 --> 17:10.834
THAT'S A PRETTY BALLSY MOVE.

17:10.934 --> 17:12.901
YOU HAD TO KNOW HALF THE
INSTALLATION WAS INFECTED.

17:13.000 --> 17:17.434
WELL, THE LEAST
WE CAN DO IS MAKE SURE YOU
DIDN'T DO IT FOR NOTHING.

17:22.434 --> 17:24.300
ALL RIGHT, DOC, YOU KNOW
WHERE HIS FRIENDS ARE?

17:24.400 --> 17:26.200
THE OLD KITCHEN
IN THE BASEMENT.

17:26.300 --> 17:27.767
TAKE THIS FIRST AID KIT.

17:27.867 --> 17:30.634
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

17:34.267 --> 17:41.100
<GRUNTING - PANTING>

17:49.000 --> 17:51.434
GO AHEAD.

17:57.534 --> 18:00.868
SHAL...

18:05.701 --> 18:08.434
WELL, WE'RE CLEAR
AS FAR AS THE CORNER.

18:08.534 --> 18:12.067
LET'S HOPE WE CAN MAKE IT
ALL THE WAY TO THE KITCHEN.

18:19.801 --> 18:21.534
YOU SURE HE'S INFECTED?

18:26.267 --> 18:28.901
TAKE A LOOK.

18:33.067 --> 18:35.267
WELL, HOW MANY OF THESE
THINGS ARE INSIDE HIM?

18:35.367 --> 18:39.601
AT THIS STAGE,
THOUSANDS, MAYBE MORE.

18:39.701 --> 18:42.701
HE ONLY HAS A FEW HOURS
LEFT BEFORE HE TURNS,

18:42.801 --> 18:45.300
AND THEIR IMPERATIVES
WILL DIRECT HIS ACTIONS.

18:45.400 --> 18:47.868
I WAS WORKING ON A TREATMENT
BEFORE THE ARMY SHUT DOWN

18:47.968 --> 18:50.334
THE MAIN
COMPUTER SYSTEM.

18:50.434 --> 18:54.534
HE CAN'T STAY HERE:
HE'LL PUT US ALL AT RISK.

18:54.634 --> 18:59.100
YOUR JOB IS TO REVERSE
THE EFFECTS, CORRECT?

18:59.200 --> 19:04.300
WELL,
MEET YOUR FIRST PATIENT.

19:17.133 --> 19:18.534
UNDER TEN MINUTES.

19:18.634 --> 19:20.701
SOMETIMES I
AM JUST FREAKIN' GOOD.

19:20.801 --> 19:23.000
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT FOR ME.

19:24.367 --> 19:27.767
NO. NO.

19:27.868 --> 19:33.267
OH, I'M GONNA
BOOKMARK YOU FOR LATER.

19:33.367 --> 19:38.501
BINGO.

19:44.167 --> 19:45.634
HEY, JESSE,
WHAT'S YOUR STATUS?

19:45.734 --> 19:47.067
WELL, I GOT SOME
NEWS ON THAT FENCE.

19:47.167 --> 19:48.601
GOOD NEWS?

19:48.701 --> 19:50.734
NO. WHOEVER DESIGNED
IT KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING.

19:50.834 --> 19:52.801
THEY'VE GOT YOU
LOCKED UP IN THERE TIGHT.

19:52.901 --> 19:55.667
THEY GOT ALL THE
POWER FROM THE WHOLE BASE
JACKED INTO THE FENCE.

19:55.767 --> 19:58.100
IT COULD TAKE ME ALL NIGHT
TO WORK OUT A WORKAROUND.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.701
HOW'S IT
GOING IN THERE?

19:59.801 --> 20:02.434
WELL, IT TURNS OUT
ARRIGO WAS CLOSE TO AN
EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENT.

20:02.534 --> 20:06.000
BUT HE HAD TO ABORT
BECAUSE HE LOST THE
MAIN RESEARCH SERVER.

20:06.100 --> 20:07.734
CAN YOU
HOOK IT BACK UP?

20:07.834 --> 20:09.567
WELL, IF THE
SERVER'S DOWN, IT'S DOWN.

20:09.667 --> 20:12.367
BUT I COULD
LINK UP YOUR COMPUTER IN
THE LAB TO MINE HERE IN

20:12.467 --> 20:14.701
THE HELIX AND THEN
TO OURS BACK IN SANCTUARY.

20:14.801 --> 20:16.801
THAT WAY WE COULD TASK
SHARE DURING THE PROCEDURES.

20:16.901 --> 20:18.701
PERFECT.

20:18.801 --> 20:21.634
OKAY... ONE NETWORK
LINK FOR THE LADY COMING UP.

20:21.734 --> 20:23.901
THANKS.

20:30.767 --> 20:34.267
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU BUT THIS PLACE
IS CREEPING ME OUT.

20:34.367 --> 20:35.934
I'M NOT ARGUING.

20:36.033 --> 20:38.601
<GUN SHOT>

20:38.701 --> 20:41.167
THAT WAS YOUR ONLY WARNING!

20:41.267 --> 20:43.801
TAKE IT EASY!
WE'RE NOT INFECTED.

20:43.901 --> 20:46.200
SHOW ME.

20:49.801 --> 20:50.801
PETER SENT US.

20:50.901 --> 20:53.834
WE HAVE INSULIN
AND MEDICAL SUPPLIES.

20:53.934 --> 20:55.734
OKAY, GET UP HERE.

20:55.834 --> 20:58.501
MOVE.

21:15.767 --> 21:18.234
SORRY ABOUT THE RESTRAINTS.
DOCTOR'S ORDERS.

21:18.334 --> 21:20.167
DON'T BE SORRY.

21:20.267 --> 21:22.734
SHIVERING AND FEVER
IS JUST THE FIRST STAGE.

21:22.834 --> 21:28.767
IT GETS A WHOLE LOT WORSE.

21:31.400 --> 21:33.701
GUESS YOU'RE PROBABLY ALL
EXPERTS ON THIS BY NOW, HUH?

21:33.801 --> 21:36.434
YEAH.

21:38.067 --> 21:40.133
ME MORE THAN MOST, THOUGH.

21:40.234 --> 21:42.667
MY SISTER WAS
THE FIRST ONE INFECTED.

21:42.767 --> 21:45.567
RACHEL. HIS ASSISTANT?

21:45.667 --> 21:46.934
YEAH.

21:47.033 --> 21:48.734
THE ONE THAT INFECTED
HERSELF IN THE LAB?

21:48.834 --> 21:50.334
THAT'S A LOAD OF CRAP.

21:50.434 --> 21:52.100
RACHEL WAS TERRIFIED
OF THAT PROJECT.

21:52.200 --> 21:55.100
THERE'S NO WAY SHE WOULD'VE GOT
CLOSE ENOUGH TO INFECT HERSELF.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.834
ARE YOU
SAYING HE'S LYING?

21:57.934 --> 22:00.234
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SAYING.

22:00.334 --> 22:02.834
I JUST DON'T TRUST HIM.

22:02.934 --> 22:04.801
WELL, YOU MIGHT HAVE TO START.

22:04.901 --> 22:07.534
HE'S COME UP WITH A TREATMENT
PROCESS THAT WE NEED YOU TO...

22:07.634 --> 22:10.834
I'LL DO IT.

22:10.934 --> 22:13.734
OH. TEN MINUTES AGO
YOU WERE ABOUT TO GIVE UP.

22:13.834 --> 22:15.267
NOW YOU'RE READY TO FIGHT.

22:15.367 --> 22:17.200
THAT'S A GOOD SIGN.

22:17.300 --> 22:18.934
THIS ISN'T
ABOUT SOME CURE.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.634
THIS IS ABOUT DEBT.

22:20.734 --> 22:23.267
I OWE MY SISTER.

22:23.367 --> 22:25.701
THINGS GOT BAD
FOR HER NEAR THE END.

22:25.801 --> 22:28.534
SHE TRIED
ATTACKING ME AND I...

22:28.634 --> 22:30.701
I...
HAD TO... HURT HER.

22:30.801 --> 22:32.734
JUST TO GET AWAY.

22:32.834 --> 22:34.567
THAT'S WHAT
THIS PARASITE IS.

22:34.667 --> 22:39.067
TURNED MY OWN FLESH
AND BLOOD INTO SOMETHING
I WAS AFRAID OF.

22:39.167 --> 22:41.167
CAN YOU IMAGINE
WHAT THAT'S LIKE?

22:41.267 --> 22:46.734
ACTUALLY, I CAN.

22:46.834 --> 22:50.701
I'LL GO TELL THE
DOCTOR YOU'RE READY.

23:03.667 --> 23:05.267
THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY OF US LEFT.

23:05.367 --> 23:06.868
AT FIRST WE JUST FOUND
EACH OTHER ON THE RUN,

23:06.968 --> 23:08.300
BUT THEN A FEW
OF US ARMED OURSELVES,

23:08.400 --> 23:11.000
STARTED DOING SWEEPS
LOOKING FOR OTHER UNINFECTED.

23:11.100 --> 23:12.067
AND NOW?

23:12.167 --> 23:13.801
WELL, NO NEW
UNINFECTED FOR HOURS.

23:13.901 --> 23:15.868
WE'RE STARTING TO
THINK WE'RE THE LAST ONES.

23:15.968 --> 23:17.467
HOW MANY WERE INJURED?

23:17.567 --> 23:19.868
A HANDFUL - FROM FALLS, MOSTLY.

23:19.968 --> 23:22.100
WELL, EXCEPT FOR ANGELA.

23:22.200 --> 23:23.734
WHO'S ANGELA.

23:23.834 --> 23:26.434
SHE'S THE ONE YOU'RE HERE FOR.

23:29.868 --> 23:30.901
YOU GET IN.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.868
COME ON, MOVE.

23:36.534 --> 23:39.033
THAT'S ANGELA OVER THERE.

23:47.868 --> 23:50.968
IT'S OKAY. I GOT
IT FROM HERE. GO AHEAD.

23:52.267 --> 23:53.767
OKAY, LEXA, WE'RE
READY TO GO HERE.

23:53.868 --> 23:55.300
ALL SYSTEMS ARE SYNCHED.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.968
<i>I'LL RUN A REAL-TIME ANALYSIS
AS YOU RUN THE PROCEDURE.</i>

24:00.267 --> 24:03.467
WE'RE GOING TO ATTEMPT TO PURIFY
THE PATIENT'S BLOOD WITH A

24:03.567 --> 24:06.567
FIRST-BORE ANTl-PARASITIC WASH.

24:06.667 --> 24:08.434
STARTING INITIAL DRIP...

24:08.534 --> 24:09.968
NOW.

24:10.067 --> 24:22.033
<GROANING>

24:22.133 --> 24:23.701
WHOA WHOA WHOA, DOCTOR.
THERE'S SOMETHING WRONG.

24:23.801 --> 24:24.934
WELL, WHAT IS IT?

24:25.033 --> 24:27.234
<i>UH, THE PARASITES
ARE MULTIPLYING - FAST.</i>

24:27.334 --> 24:29.534
<MOANING>

24:29.634 --> 24:30.968
GET THE SEDATIVE.

24:31.067 --> 24:32.300
I SAID THE SEDATIVE!

24:32.400 --> 24:33.868
KILLING HIM WOULD
BE A KINDNESS RIGHT NOW.

24:33.968 --> 24:35.167
THIS IS THE
RIGHT THING TO DO.

24:35.267 --> 24:37.834
I AM NOT GOING
TO ASK YOU AGAIN.

24:37.934 --> 24:43.434
<GROANING>

24:49.467 --> 24:51.133
YOU'RE GOING
TO BE AS GOOD AS NEW.

24:51.234 --> 24:52.667
IT'S GOING TO BE OKAY.

24:52.767 --> 24:55.334
FEEL BETTER?

25:07.601 --> 25:09.000
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

25:09.100 --> 25:10.868
IS THERE SOMEPLACE
YOU CAN LOCK YOURSELVES?

25:10.968 --> 25:12.801
WHY?

25:12.901 --> 25:17.100
SOMEONE HERE'S INFECTED.

25:21.234 --> 25:22.567
<SNARLS>

25:22.667 --> 25:24.501
AGH...!

25:24.601 --> 25:29.667
<ROARS> <GUN SHOTS>

25:35.601 --> 25:37.634
OH, MY GOD. BRENNAN.

25:37.734 --> 25:40.567
WHAT?

25:40.667 --> 25:43.334
YOU'VE BEEN INFECTED.

25:52.501 --> 25:54.000
WE NEED TO GET OUT OF HERE.

25:54.100 --> 25:55.801
IT'S TOO LATE.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.968
DROP IT. DROP IT!

26:03.200 --> 26:04.934
OPEN THAT DOOR!

26:06.367 --> 26:08.567
IT'S ALREADY HITTING ME.
I CAN FEEL IT.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.100
LET'S GO.

26:11.200 --> 26:12.567
IT'S NOT SAFE FOR YOU
TO BE AROUND ME ANYMORE.

26:12.667 --> 26:13.868
I TRUST YOU. I DON'T!

26:13.968 --> 26:15.300
UGH... UGH...!

26:15.400 --> 26:18.734
<i>GET THE DOOR... OPEN UP...!</i>

26:18.834 --> 26:21.234
<i>SHUT THE DOOR!</i>

26:24.200 --> 26:26.133
IS THERE NO OTHER WAY? SIR?

26:26.234 --> 26:27.767
<i>BARRING NEW DEVELOPMENTS, NO.</i>

26:27.868 --> 26:29.901
<i>START READYING
YOUR TEAM TO MOVE OUT.</i>

26:30.000 --> 26:32.534
<i>IT'S A TOUGH CALL, KLEIN,
BUT IT'S THE RIGHT ONE.</i>

26:32.634 --> 26:34.200
DONE.

26:34.300 --> 26:35.467
PREPARE TO MOVE THE UNIT.

26:35.567 --> 26:37.334
WASHINGTON IS CALLING
IN AN AIR STRIKE.

26:58.434 --> 27:01.133
AND WE HAVE A WINNER.

27:05.133 --> 27:06.434
OKAY,
WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE?

27:06.534 --> 27:08.434
EXPERIMENTING
WITH ANTl-SENSE AGENTS.

27:08.534 --> 27:12.734
DIFFERENT VARIETIES ARE
TOXIC TO DIFFERENT PARASITES.

27:12.834 --> 27:15.734
OKAY,
IS NOW A GOOD TIME TO TELL
YOU I FAILED CHEM CLASS?

27:15.834 --> 27:17.868
<LAUGHS>

27:21.367 --> 27:23.567
<SIGHS>

27:23.667 --> 27:25.934
IS THAT GOOD?

27:26.033 --> 27:28.000
NO.

27:33.834 --> 27:35.701
THAT MAY HAVE BEEN OVERKILL.

27:35.801 --> 27:37.601
WHAT HAPPENED?

27:37.701 --> 27:39.667
WE VERIFIED WHAT WE SAW
DURING PETER'S EXPERIMENTS.

27:39.767 --> 27:43.000
THE PARASITES
HAVE APPARENTLY DEVELOPED
SOME SORT OF PROTECTIVE

27:43.100 --> 27:47.667
MECHANISM AND WHEN THEY
SENSE AN ATTACK THEY MULTIPLY.

27:47.767 --> 27:49.100
NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.

27:49.200 --> 27:51.133
YOU CAN'T BE
THAT EASILY INFECTED.

27:51.234 --> 27:53.934
YOU NEED BROKEN SKIN.

27:54.033 --> 27:57.400
LET ME GET RID OF THIS.

27:59.968 --> 28:01.534
HEY, LEXA.

28:01.634 --> 28:02.834
<i>TELL ME YOU GUYS GOT SOMETHING.</i>

28:02.934 --> 28:04.501
WE'RE COMING UP SQUAT HERE.

28:04.601 --> 28:05.934
MAYBE.

28:06.067 --> 28:07.601
I RAN SOME RECOGNITION
SOFTWARE ON ARRIGO'S BUG,

28:07.701 --> 28:09.200
HACKED INTO A
PARASITOLOGY DATABASE.

28:09.300 --> 28:10.801
GOT KIND OF A MATCH.

28:10.901 --> 28:12.200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, "KIND OF"?

28:12.300 --> 28:14.167
WELL,

28:14.267 --> 28:18.367
ARRIGO'S BUG HAS KIND OF
A DEFINING PHYSICAL
CHARACTERISTIC.

28:18.467 --> 28:22.033
IT STORES IRON IN A VERY
PECULIAR MANNER IN ITS BODY.

28:22.133 --> 28:28.033
NOW, THE ONLY OTHER
PARASITE THAT DOES THAT
ARE CALLED PLASMODIUMS.

28:28.133 --> 28:30.400
PLASMODIUMS CAUSE MALARIA.

28:30.501 --> 28:32.834
AND THIS IS EXCITING WHY?

28:32.934 --> 28:35.000
BECAUSE PLASMODIUMS
CAN BE KILLED.

28:35.100 --> 28:38.534
NOW THERE ARE FOUR DIFFERENT
PLASMODIUM GROUPS, THOUGH,

28:38.634 --> 28:42.234
AND THEY EACH
HAVE THEIR OWN CURE.

28:42.334 --> 28:44.367
YEAH, BUT IT'S A HELL
OF A GOOD WAY TO START.

28:44.467 --> 28:46.501
I'LL ALERT ARRIGO.

28:46.601 --> 28:51.033
JESS, ONE MORE THING: I NEED
YOU TO HACK THE PRELIM AUTOPSY

28:51.133 --> 28:52.968
REPORT ON RACHEL MORTON.

28:53.067 --> 28:54.901
IT SHOULD BE IN
THE BASE HOSPITAL FILES.

28:55.000 --> 28:57.367
THAT'S THE FIRST VICTIM, RIGHT?

28:57.467 --> 28:58.734
WHAT'S THAT ALL ABOUT?

28:58.834 --> 29:00.701
LOOK, IT'S A LONG SHOT -
JUST HUMOUR ME.

29:00.801 --> 29:04.033
ALL RIGHT.

29:14.868 --> 29:17.934
BRENNAN?

29:39.601 --> 29:42.000
OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, I GOT
THE AUTOPSY REPORT YOU
WERE LOOKING FOR.

29:42.100 --> 29:44.634
I'M SENDING IT TO YOU
NOW OVER A SECURED CHANNEL.

29:44.734 --> 29:46.801
OKAY, WHAT ABOUT
THE MALARIA ISSUE?

29:46.901 --> 29:48.267
LOOKS PROMISING.

29:48.367 --> 29:50.234
THERE'S A NEW TREATMENT THAT
INVOLVES DOSING THE HOST WITH

29:50.334 --> 29:51.834
ROTATING ELECTROMAGNETIC FIELDS.

29:51.934 --> 29:54.400
IT CAUSES THE IRON
IN THE PARASITE'S BODY TO TWIST,
RUPTURING THEM.

29:54.501 --> 29:57.267
SO YOU CAN FRY THE PARASITES
WITHOUT HARMING THE HOSTS?

29:57.367 --> 29:59.200
YOU GOT IT, BUT ONLY IF
IT'S DONE WITH EXACTLY THE RIGHT

29:59.300 --> 30:01.067
FREQUENCY AND PULSE.

30:01.167 --> 30:02.734
OTHERWISE IT COULD BE DEADLY.

30:02.834 --> 30:04.234
<COMPUTER ALERT SOUND>

30:04.334 --> 30:05.501
HEY, HOLD ON.

30:05.601 --> 30:06.968
- WHAT?

30:07.067 --> 30:09.234
SENSOR'S SHOWING INCOMING PLANES
LOCKED INTO YOUR POSITION.

30:09.334 --> 30:10.934
WHAT PLANES?

30:11.033 --> 30:13.033
I DON'T KNOW.

30:13.133 --> 30:15.601
THEY'RE NOT ON ANY
REGISTERED FLIGHT PLANS.

30:15.701 --> 30:18.334
BOMBERS.

30:23.334 --> 30:24.834
SHALIMAR, WHERE ARE YOU?

30:24.934 --> 30:26.467
MAIN FLOOR OFFICES.

30:26.567 --> 30:27.968
I CAN'T FIND BRENNAN.

30:28.067 --> 30:29.334
NO, IT'S TOO LATE.

30:29.434 --> 30:31.968
YOU NEED TO GET AWAY FROM HIM.

30:32.868 --> 30:35.133
<GROWLING>

30:36.434 --> 30:47.133
<SNARLING>

30:54.968 --> 30:57.567
SHALIMAR, WHAT'S GOING ON?

30:57.667 --> 31:00.067
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK I HEARD HIM.

31:00.167 --> 31:02.133
NO. YOU CAN'T GET CLOSE
TO HIM - HE'S TOO STRONG.

31:02.234 --> 31:03.801
HE WON'T HURT ME.

31:03.901 --> 31:07.868
<GROWLING>

31:14.000 --> 31:16.601
LOOKS LIKE HE'S TURNED.

31:20.701 --> 31:22.000
<i>I THINK WE HAVE IT.</i>

31:22.100 --> 31:23.834
WE THINK WE FOUND
A WAY TO TREAT HIM.

31:23.934 --> 31:25.567
WELL, YOU KNOW THE FENCE?

31:25.667 --> 31:27.133
I COULD GET TO IT, WHY?

31:27.234 --> 31:29.634
OKAY, WELL, YOU NEED TO GET
BRENNAN TO FORM A TESLA COIL.

31:29.734 --> 31:32.634
AND THROW HIM AGAINST
THE ELECTRICAL FENCE.

31:32.734 --> 31:34.834
YOU CRAZY? THAT'LL KILL HIM.

31:34.934 --> 31:37.234
WE KNOW. IT WOULD KILL A NORMAL
PERSON, BUT WITH BRENNAN,

31:37.334 --> 31:41.367
WE THINK IT'LL FORM A MAGNETIC
FIELD THAT WILL RUPTURE THE
PARASITES IN HIS SYSTEM.

31:44.133 --> 31:46.200
LOOK, THESE THINGS ARE GOING
TO KILL HIM ANYWAY, SHALIMAR.

31:46.300 --> 31:48.868
YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF
THERE BEFORE HE KILLS YOU, TOO.

31:48.968 --> 31:51.234
I CAN'T RISK IT.

31:51.334 --> 31:52.667
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

31:52.767 --> 31:55.133
IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO SAVE HIM.

31:55.234 --> 32:00.767
<GROWLING AND SNARLING>

32:41.734 --> 32:46.033
HEY. HEY... YOU OKAY?

32:53.033 --> 32:54.868
LEXA, IT WORKED.

32:54.968 --> 32:56.868
OKAY. BOTH OF YOU GUYS GET
BACK HERE NOW, SOON AS YOU CAN.

32:56.968 --> 33:00.801
WE STILL DON'T KNOW
IF IT WORKS ON NON-MUTANTS.

33:09.868 --> 33:13.367
YOU CALLED
AN AIR STRIKE! WHY?

33:18.000 --> 33:19.868
THE INFECTION
HAS SPREAD TOO FAR.

33:19.968 --> 33:21.300
BASED ON WHAT?

33:21.400 --> 33:25.300
YOUR PROFOUND
UNDERSTANDING OF PARASITOLOGY?

33:32.133 --> 33:34.534
THE INFECTED HAVE
A RAISED BODY TEMPERATURE.

33:34.634 --> 33:38.901
THEY SHOW UP
RED ON THERMAL IMAGES.

33:42.133 --> 33:48.033
THIS IS A SATELLITE
SCAN OF THE BASE AS
OF FORTY-EIGHT HOURS AGO.

33:49.767 --> 33:52.234
THIS ONE IS FROM AN HOUR AGO.

33:52.334 --> 33:56.000
LESS THAN FIFTY PEOPLE ON
THAT BASE ARE LEFT UNINFECTED.

33:56.100 --> 33:58.701
BUT THEY CAN'T
GET OFF THE BASE.

33:58.801 --> 34:00.567
YOU SAID SO YOURSELF.

34:00.667 --> 34:05.200
THAT'S AN ASSUMPTION,
NOT A CERTAINTY.

34:07.667 --> 34:10.967
HOW MANY THOUSANDS
OF LIVES ARE YOU WILLING
TO GAMBLE ON THAT?

34:11.067 --> 34:13.266
WE ARE VERY
CLOSE TO AN ANTIDOTE.

34:13.367 --> 34:16.300
I PROMISE YOU.

34:16.400 --> 34:19.667
I'M SORRY,
SON, BUT YOUR FRIENDS
KNEW THE RISKS GOING IN.

34:19.766 --> 34:21.234
GIVE THEM MORE TIME.

34:21.333 --> 34:23.234
PLEASE.

34:23.333 --> 34:25.167
THE ORDER'S BEEN GIVEN.

34:25.266 --> 34:27.567
THEY'RE OUT OF TIME.

34:37.000 --> 34:38.467
JESSE, HOW MUCH TIME DO WE HAVE?

34:38.567 --> 34:39.667
YOU DON'T HAVE LONG.

34:39.766 --> 34:41.367
I'D SAY ABOUT TEN MINUTES.

34:41.467 --> 34:42.667
OH, DAMMIT.

34:42.766 --> 34:44.400
LOOK, THIS ISN'T HOPELESS.

34:44.501 --> 34:46.400
LET'S JUST THINK
THIS THROUGH, OKAY?

34:46.501 --> 34:48.868
<i>NOW, IF YOU CAN ESTABLISH
THAT THIS WORKS ON NON-MUTANTS,</i>

34:48.967 --> 34:50.801
AND FIGURE OUT HOW TO DO IT
LARGE SCALE, THEN I CAN KILL THE

34:50.900 --> 34:53.067
FENCE AND YOU CAN
GET THE HELL OUT OF THERE.

34:53.167 --> 34:55.367
YEAH, BUT THAT DOESN'T
SAVE ANYBODY ELSE.

34:55.467 --> 34:57.968
<i>WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO
EVACUATE IN TIME FOR THE DROP.</i>

34:58.067 --> 34:59.501
LET ME WORRY ABOUT THE BOMBS.

34:59.601 --> 35:01.400
YOU TAKE CARE OF THE INFECTION,
I'LL TAKE CARE OF KLEIN.

35:01.501 --> 35:02.734
GOOD?

35:02.834 --> 35:05.734
OH, LET'S JUST HOPE THIS WORKS.

35:17.200 --> 35:22.667
<GROANING>

35:30.334 --> 35:33.968
FASTER!

35:34.067 --> 35:36.567
DON'T STOP.

35:36.667 --> 35:39.434
THE PARASITES ARE RIPPING APART.

35:49.067 --> 35:51.601
IT WORKED.

35:51.701 --> 35:53.367
WELL, DON'T GET TOO EXCITED.

35:53.467 --> 35:55.300
THERE'S NO WAY I'M GONNA
BE ABLE TO DO THAT WITH ALL THE

35:55.400 --> 35:56.934
INFECTED THAT ARE LEFT.

35:57.033 --> 35:58.534
WELL, WHAT IF WE FIND
YOU A POWER SOURCE TO FEED FROM?

35:58.634 --> 36:00.033
HEY, JESS?

36:00.133 --> 36:01.901
<i>I CAN DIRECT THE BASE'S POWER
FROM THE FENCE BACK INTO THE</i>

36:02.000 --> 36:04.100
INSTALLATION, BUT KLEIN'S MEN
WILL BE ALL OVER US THE MOMENT

36:04.200 --> 36:05.868
THEY REALISE THE FENCE IS DOWN.

36:05.968 --> 36:07.834
WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO GET
ALL THE INFECTED IN ONE SPOT SO

36:07.934 --> 36:10.300
WE CAN GET THEM
ALL WITH ONE BLAST.

36:10.400 --> 36:12.501
WE NEED BAIT.

36:12.601 --> 36:15.200
BLOOD.
IT'S WHAT DRAWS THEM.

36:15.300 --> 36:17.133
UNINFECTED BLOOD TO
PASS THE PARASITES ONTO,

36:17.234 --> 36:19.300
ESPECIALLY IF THEY
RUN OUT OF NEW HOSTS.

36:19.400 --> 36:22.534
I HAVE BLOOD
IN THE FRIDGE.

36:22.634 --> 36:24.300
<i>THERE'S A GENERATOR IN
THE BASEMENT OF THE BUILDING</i>

36:24.400 --> 36:25.968
YOU'RE IN RIGHT NOW.

36:26.100 --> 36:27.734
I CAN GIVE YOU... FIVE MINUTES.

36:27.834 --> 36:29.334
ALL RIGHT.
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

36:30.167 --> 36:32.133
COMING?

36:32.234 --> 36:35.367
NO. ACTUALLY,
THERE WAS SOMETHING
I GOTTA TAKE CARE OF HERE.

37:23.367 --> 37:49.567
<GROWLING>

37:49.667 --> 37:54.601
THEY'RE COMING. LOTS OF 'EM.

38:09.133 --> 38:12.400
PETER'S SISTER'S
AUTOPSY RESULTS.

38:15.300 --> 38:18.667
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

38:18.767 --> 38:20.934
YOU SAID THE PARASITE
COULD ONLY BE PASSED
THROUGH OPEN WOUNDS.

38:21.033 --> 38:23.667
WELL,
ACCORDING TO THESE PHOTOS,
RACHEL'S ONLY WOUND WAS A

38:23.767 --> 38:27.234
NEEDLE PUNCTURE - IN HER BACK.

38:27.334 --> 38:34.934
YOU COULDN'T EVEN
DO IT TO HER FACE.

38:35.033 --> 38:37.234
I'M NOT A MONSTER.

38:37.334 --> 38:39.734
I THOUGHT I COULD
FIND A CURE FOR HER.

38:39.834 --> 38:41.667
I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT IT WOULD GET OUT.

38:41.767 --> 38:43.667
HUH, RATIONALIZATIONS ARE
A BEAUTIFUL THING, AREN'T THEY?

38:43.767 --> 38:45.601
I HAD NO CHOICE.

38:45.701 --> 38:50.734
THIS DISCOVERY COULD
CHANGE THE FACE OF WAR.

38:50.834 --> 38:53.901
IT WOULD MAKE THIS
COUNTRY INVINCIBLE.

38:54.000 --> 38:57.367
WHAT? BY INFECTING PEOPLE
IN SOMEONE ELSE'S COUNTRY?

38:57.467 --> 39:00.400
JUST THINK OF THE LIVES
WE WOULD BE SAVING HERE.

39:00.501 --> 39:03.300
WHY DON'T YOU THINK ABOUT
THE PEOPLE YOU KILLED TODAY?

39:04.467 --> 39:07.601
THIS ISN'T ABOUT
SAVING LIVES FOR YOU.

39:07.701 --> 39:13.167
THIS IS ABOUT GOING DOWN
IN THE HISTORY BOOKS, ISN'T IT?

39:13.267 --> 39:14.467
COME ON, BREN, THEY'RE ON US.

39:14.567 --> 39:15.601
NO. WE NEED TO WAIT.

39:15.701 --> 39:16.901
THEY NEED TO ALL BE IN THE ROOM.

39:17.000 --> 39:18.434
I ONLY GOT ONE SHOT AT THIS.

39:18.534 --> 39:20.634
<i>BRENNAN? I'M AT THE
TRANSFORMER'S CONTROLS NOW.</i>

39:20.734 --> 39:23.467
POWERING IT UP.

39:32.534 --> 39:35.234
NOW, JESS!

39:36.300 --> 39:45.434
<ROARING - MOANING>

39:47.033 --> 39:48.234
THE FENCE IS OUT?

39:48.334 --> 39:51.367
GET OUT THERE.
SHOOT ANYONE ON SIGHT.

39:55.033 --> 39:57.400
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

39:57.501 --> 39:59.133
I SHOULD GIVE YOU
TO THOSE THINGS OUT THERE.

39:59.234 --> 40:02.200
LET THEM HAVE
THEIR WAY WITH YOU.

40:09.801 --> 40:12.334
HEY, YOU OKAY?

40:21.534 --> 40:26.200
I HAVE ANOTHER IDEA.

40:31.067 --> 40:34.634
EVERYTHING WOULD'VE BEEN FINE...

40:34.734 --> 40:37.734
IF YOU WOULD'VE
JUST STAYED OUT OF IT.

40:40.434 --> 40:43.300
<GUN SHOT>

40:50.968 --> 40:53.400
NICE.

41:03.133 --> 41:05.400
<i>THEY'RE COMING OUT!</i>

41:11.367 --> 41:14.200
ON MY SIGNAL.

41:14.300 --> 41:20.868
HOLD YOUR FIRE!
HOLD YOUR FIRE!

41:20.968 --> 41:22.200
WHAT IS THIS?

41:22.300 --> 41:24.133
YOU SAID THAT NO ONE GOT
OUT UNTIL THEY HAD PROOF THAT

41:24.234 --> 41:25.234
THE THREAT OF
CONTAGION WAS OVER.

41:25.334 --> 41:27.234
THERE'S YOUR PROOF.

41:27.334 --> 41:29.501
STAND DOWN.

41:29.601 --> 41:32.434
I THINK YOU MIGHT WANT
TO CALL OFF THOSE BOMBS.

41:34.400 --> 41:36.901
THIS IS MAJOR GENERAL KLEIN.

41:43.868 --> 41:45.067
YOU ALL RIGHT?

41:45.167 --> 41:46.734
YES.

41:46.834 --> 41:48.868
COULDN'T HAVE
GOTTEN MUCH CLOSER.

41:48.968 --> 41:50.767
ARRIGO?

41:52.367 --> 41:54.234
WELL, MAYBE GUYS LIKE
THIS WILL FINALLY LEARN.

41:54.334 --> 41:58.133
MESS WITH MOTHER
NATURE, SHE MESSES BACK.

41:58.234 --> 42:01.534
YEAH,
AND I WONDER HOW LONG WE'RE
GOING TO HAVE TO PAY FOR IT?
