00:12.762 --> 00:15.056
Cleo, do you actually know
where you're going?

00:15.056 --> 00:18.143
We can hole up here.
It ain't the Taj Mahal, but...

00:18.852 --> 00:20.186
- It'll do.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.688
I get the biggest room.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.282
Over there!

00:36.911 --> 00:38.246
Go, go, go, go!

00:39.622 --> 00:40.749
Come! Quick!

00:47.964 --> 00:49.758
- All clear!

00:52.719 --> 00:53.720
Go!

00:57.932 --> 01:00.810
- You sure this is safe?
-  You got a better idea?

01:02.896 --> 01:06.524
We can stay here. It's an old hotel.
Terrance and I squatted here before.

01:07.108 --> 01:08.109
Five stars.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.449
Watch your step.

01:14.449 --> 01:16.493
- Massive sinkhole.

01:16.493 --> 01:19.370
Oh. Home sweet home.

01:20.789 --> 01:24.417
We gotta get Kiara out, guys.
Does anyone have anything?

01:25.502 --> 01:28.004
Well, we can't storm the fort.
We can't call the cops.

01:28.004 --> 01:30.090
- It's not helping, Pope.
-  We can't negotiate.

01:30.090 --> 01:31.299
We don't know what they want.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.344
It's got to be
about the cross or the gold.

01:35.053 --> 01:36.304
Mm-mm.

01:36.304 --> 01:39.390
- Guys like Singh, it's always about money.

01:43.019 --> 01:44.354
What are you thinking?

01:44.896 --> 01:47.941
I don't know. We all just gotta get off
this damn island.

02:18.471 --> 02:20.390
Hey! Hey.

02:20.390 --> 02:22.475
I need to talk to Mr. Singh.

02:23.768 --> 02:26.729
Hey, go get Mr. Singh.

02:26.729 --> 02:28.398
What are you doing?

02:28.398 --> 02:31.985
- Hey, you! I need to talk to Mr. Singh.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

02:31.985 --> 02:35.238
- Hey. What are you doing?
- Like I owe you an explanation.

02:36.156 --> 02:39.325
Think for a second!
Kie, what are you doing?

02:40.285 --> 02:42.370
- Hello?
- Hey! What're you doing?

02:42.370 --> 02:43.788
Don't talk to me!

02:48.543 --> 02:51.004
You're lying about this diary thing.

02:52.505 --> 02:53.506
You know where it is.

02:54.090 --> 02:55.884
No, I don't.

02:55.884 --> 02:58.052
- You don't? Okay.
-  You wish.

02:58.052 --> 03:00.305
- Okay, listen, I wouldn't tell me either.
- Hey!

03:00.305 --> 03:03.349
But he's never gonna believe
we don't know something, all right?

03:03.349 --> 03:04.934
- Singh killed that--
- Hey!

03:07.061 --> 03:08.730
Look around, Kie.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.192
I'm the only friend you got.

03:17.780 --> 03:18.781
Hey.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.160
I need to talk to Mr. Singh.

03:22.160 --> 03:24.704
I have something to tell him. It's urgent.

03:32.795 --> 03:33.713
Yes.

03:44.432 --> 03:45.391
Shit!

03:54.692 --> 03:56.778
That's the fourth truck I've seen.

03:56.778 --> 03:59.614
If they're still searching,
it means they haven't found him yet.

04:01.616 --> 04:04.869
I went to my connection
at the police department.

04:04.869 --> 04:09.123
They said if they get to John B first,
they'll turn him over to us.

04:09.123 --> 04:11.209
- Where do you think he might've gone?
- I don't know--

04:11.209 --> 04:13.544
- John, who would he call?
-  I don't know.

04:13.544 --> 04:15.588
-  You don't know your son?
- I don't know!

04:16.798 --> 04:19.092
We should be out there looking for him!

04:19.592 --> 04:20.593
God!

04:24.597 --> 04:27.141
You always were too emotional, John.

04:27.141 --> 04:29.394
It's one of the reasons
Ward got the best of you.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.895
No attention to detail.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.732
It doesn't do me any good
if you get caught.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.573
The game's not over yet.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.005
What is that?

04:57.005 --> 05:00.341
This is a little souvenir
that I plucked from Portis' pocket.

05:00.341 --> 05:02.135
- You have a phone?
-  I forgot I had it.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.887
- It was in my back pocket. That's my bad.
-  Oh my God, dude.

05:04.887 --> 05:07.098
Can we go anywhere without you stealing?

05:07.098 --> 05:08.850
- You know the answer.
-  Let me see it.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.476
Nice work, rude boy.

05:10.476 --> 05:12.603
I steal shit. That's my job.

05:13.646 --> 05:16.441
- How'd you get this unlocked?
-  No passcode. Portis keeps it loose.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.526
-  What are you looking for?
- The kidnapper.

05:18.526 --> 05:21.195
Any information
that'll help us negotiate with this guy.

05:21.195 --> 05:24.282
The only problem is I don't see
a Carlos Singh in the contacts.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.325
That's the problem.

05:25.325 --> 05:27.702
- It's just a bunch of nicknames and shit.
-  Wait.

05:29.495 --> 05:31.497
- Didn't Portis call him something else?
-  Right.

05:31.497 --> 05:34.334
Yeah, he called Singh something
when we were jumping his ass.

05:34.334 --> 05:36.711
-  It was like Rockfish or--
- Can't remember.

05:36.711 --> 05:38.421
-  Oh shit! No, no, no.
- Catfish?

05:38.421 --> 05:39.922
What was it? Holy crap! Um...

05:39.922 --> 05:41.090
Kingfish.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.844
- That was it. Kingfish.
- Kingfish. That was it.

05:44.844 --> 05:46.304
"Kingfish."

05:46.804 --> 05:48.389
There he is, Kingfish.

05:48.389 --> 05:50.016
And we in business.

05:50.016 --> 05:51.768
All right, phase two.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.353
Text him, okay?

05:53.353 --> 05:54.687
And say what exactly?

05:54.687 --> 05:57.273
You know, you said it. Negotiate, right?

05:57.273 --> 06:00.360
Pretend to be Portis,
ask him to meet somewhere in private.

06:00.360 --> 06:02.945
That was... that's really important.
Just solo.

06:02.945 --> 06:04.947
Bam! We jump his ass, tie him up,

06:04.947 --> 06:07.992
and then politely request
for Kiara in return for his life.

06:07.992 --> 06:10.328
- That's the plan.
-  That's gonna work.

06:10.328 --> 06:12.372
- Not a bad idea.
- Not a bad idea? It's terrific!

06:12.372 --> 06:15.625
Okay, I'm gonna say it.
We should think this through.

06:15.625 --> 06:16.876
What's rule number one?

06:16.876 --> 06:19.670
Thinking never helps
when you already have the idea.

06:19.670 --> 06:21.381
No, hang on. I agree with Pope.

06:21.381 --> 06:25.176
This could make things ten times worse
for us and Kiara.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.636
How much worse can it actually get?

06:26.636 --> 06:28.638
- I can think of a few ways.
-  Okay, great.

06:28.638 --> 06:31.015
While you're thinking,
why don't you just let it rip?

06:31.015 --> 06:32.016
Thank you.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.441
There.

06:46.864 --> 06:47.865
I lied.

06:48.908 --> 06:50.284
I know about the diary.

06:52.954 --> 06:54.580
I don't have the original.

06:55.164 --> 06:56.791
But I can get you a copy.

07:00.837 --> 07:03.005
I'm relieved to hear you say that,
you know.

07:06.300 --> 07:08.970
- May I offer you something to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

07:08.970 --> 07:11.806
Relax.
Nothing's gonna happen to you now.

07:11.806 --> 07:13.099
You're cooperating,

07:13.099 --> 07:16.018
and I don't want to make
you feel uncomfortable, you know.

07:16.018 --> 07:20.148
I just want to get you what you want,
and then I want to leave.

07:21.607 --> 07:23.109
Look, I know where it is.

07:24.026 --> 07:26.028
But I have to go by myself.

07:27.488 --> 07:28.322
Alone.

07:31.868 --> 07:36.622
But how would I know that you'd come back?
You know, I need some collateral.

07:36.622 --> 07:38.666
- Rafe's here.

07:38.666 --> 07:40.209
- Keep him.
-  Rafe.

07:44.714 --> 07:46.674
How did someone so young

07:47.341 --> 07:49.135
get into so much trouble?

07:52.597 --> 07:55.892
Look, I know where the diary is,
and if you let me go,

07:55.892 --> 07:58.019
I promise you I can get it to you.

08:01.939 --> 08:04.692
You know, I built
this fortune myself, you know,

08:06.277 --> 08:07.403
from nothing.

08:08.654 --> 08:10.406
From absolutely nothing.

08:12.450 --> 08:15.161
Do you know
how that happened, Miss Carrera? Hmm?

08:15.912 --> 08:17.330
I can assure you

08:17.330 --> 08:19.415
it was not by being a fool.

08:20.374 --> 08:21.959
Don't waste my time.

08:22.752 --> 08:26.547
The diary holds the key
to the ultimate conquest,

08:26.547 --> 08:29.467
and that, my young friend, Miss Carrera,

08:30.259 --> 08:31.719
is my destiny.

08:32.970 --> 08:36.098
So you need to tell me where it is,
or I'm gonna--

08:51.405 --> 08:52.323
Amazing.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.617
A text from our friend Jimmy Portis.

08:55.785 --> 08:57.828
From beyond the grave, apparently.

08:57.828 --> 09:01.123
It seems Mr. Portis
has captured your friends.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.253
Ryan!

09:09.507 --> 09:12.260
Yo, he's texting! He's texting!
What's he saying? What's he saying?

09:12.260 --> 09:15.012
- It's doing the little bubble thing.
- Oh.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.641
-"Send me your location. I'll meet you."
- He wants our location?

09:18.641 --> 09:21.143
Yeah, that's exactly what we wanted!
Here, check it. Boom!

09:21.143 --> 09:22.520
- And say what?
- Well...

09:22.520 --> 09:25.356
We can't give Singh our location.
Just give him some random place.

09:25.356 --> 09:27.149
All right. Where do we want
to send him to?

09:27.149 --> 09:30.319
What about the horse tracks?
I saw them yesterday. It's wide open.

09:30.319 --> 09:31.821
- We can do surveillance.
-  Yeah!

09:31.821 --> 09:34.031
Now we're working.
Now we're jelling! I like it.

09:34.031 --> 09:36.492
And if we have to make a getaway,
we'll hop on some horses.

09:36.492 --> 09:39.579
- Guns a-blazing!
- No. We're not horse-backing with guns.

09:39.579 --> 09:42.164
- Scratch the horses.
- John B, we can really plan this out.

09:43.124 --> 09:45.209
- What are you thinking?
-  Just got another text.

09:45.209 --> 09:47.211
Maybe sneak from behind
and use JJ as bait.

09:47.211 --> 09:48.921
Just put him in the middle of the field.

09:48.921 --> 09:52.925
Uh, little announcement. "Never mind.
I just tracked your location."

09:53.509 --> 09:54.677
"And I'm sending my men."

09:54.677 --> 09:56.887
"They'll be there
in ten minutes to pick you up."

10:04.562 --> 10:06.731
Wait a minute.
Did you turn off your location?

10:06.731 --> 10:09.567
- So--
- You didn't turn the location off?

10:09.567 --> 10:11.736
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Turn the location off!

10:11.736 --> 10:13.738
- I have a Samsung!
- I have a Samsung too!

10:13.738 --> 10:14.655
I can help!

10:14.655 --> 10:16.741
This right here
is why you need a plan!

10:16.741 --> 10:19.118
Everybody relax for a second!
Let's just think about this!

10:19.118 --> 10:20.995
-  What are we gonna do?
- It's done, okay?

10:20.995 --> 10:23.539
- Gotta figure something out.
-  And hope he doesn't kill us?

10:23.539 --> 10:25.666
-  We're running out of time.
-  What're we gonna do?

10:25.666 --> 10:27.627
I don't know. I'm thinking.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.671
Well, y'all, I know
you guys might not wanna hear it.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.966
But we got home-field advantage.
We can turn this around.

10:35.968 --> 10:37.637
We're gonna booby-trap this shit.

10:38.220 --> 10:41.474
We're not running from this dude.
This is our best chance to get Kiara back.

10:41.474 --> 10:43.643
It's gonna work.
We got ten minutes. Come on!

10:44.894 --> 10:46.896
Get the big trucks
and meet me in the back.

10:46.896 --> 10:48.230
- Copy.
- Fenton.

10:48.230 --> 10:50.566
- Get Ms. Carrera.
- Mr. Singh, Mr. Singh, please--

10:50.566 --> 10:52.902
Please don't hurt my friends! Please!

10:52.902 --> 10:56.238
Please! Please!
Please don't hurt them!

10:56.238 --> 10:58.407
- That depends, Ms. Carrera.
- Mr. Singh!

10:58.407 --> 11:01.243
We'll continue our chat later.
I look forward to it, you know.

11:01.243 --> 11:02.453
Please don't hurt them.

11:04.789 --> 11:05.873
Inside!

11:14.840 --> 11:15.758
What happened?

11:20.846 --> 11:23.265
You're gonna have to talk
to me at some point. Okay?

11:23.933 --> 11:26.185
Do I have to remind you
of everything you've done?

11:27.353 --> 11:28.646
- You killed Peterkin.

11:28.646 --> 11:32.692
Do you remember that?
And everything you've put Sarah through.

11:32.692 --> 11:35.736
Peterkin, I was protecting my father.
Okay?

11:36.320 --> 11:39.907
I did what I had to, so... don't.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.915
I'm as much a victim as she is.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.001
No? Think about it.

11:51.001 --> 11:53.713
Okay? What did I get
from shooting Peterkin, huh?

11:54.338 --> 11:55.798
Nothing. Okay?

11:55.798 --> 11:58.884
I had nothing against her.
I mean, I... I... I liked her.

11:58.884 --> 12:02.722
You think I wanted
to make that choice, huh?

12:03.556 --> 12:07.893
What I did was a gift
from me to my father for... for him,

12:08.436 --> 12:11.272
and I got screwed because of it, okay?

12:11.272 --> 12:14.775
So don't get that look
when I say I'm a victim, all right?

12:14.775 --> 12:15.860
I am!

12:20.656 --> 12:24.452
I will admit, though,
what I... what I did to Sarah...

12:28.372 --> 12:30.374
what I tried to do, um...

12:32.626 --> 12:35.254
what I tried to do to Sarah,
I admit that was wrong.

12:38.215 --> 12:39.633
I know that. All right?

12:40.134 --> 12:42.428
So you don't have to remind me.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.227
- Oh God.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.272
She was family.
I should've never touched her, you know?

12:53.272 --> 12:56.233
I should've never touched her,
but, you know, I just lose control

12:56.233 --> 12:58.736
in moments like that,
and I don't know what happened.

12:58.736 --> 13:01.280
I'm trying... I'm trying to get better.

13:01.280 --> 13:02.490
- Yeah.
-  Okay?

13:06.952 --> 13:07.912
It doesn't matter.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.956
All I'm saying is just that I'm not
the bad guy you think I am, okay?

13:10.956 --> 13:15.252
But even if I was, even if I was just,
like, bad Rafe Cameron or something...

13:16.420 --> 13:17.797
...you got no choice.

13:18.380 --> 13:21.717
You may... you may not want to trust me,
okay, but I'm your best bet.

13:25.304 --> 13:26.180
Look.

13:30.059 --> 13:32.436
I got a boat
that can get us off island, okay?

13:32.436 --> 13:36.607
But first, we gotta get out of here,
and it is better

13:37.191 --> 13:38.484
if we work together.

13:49.703 --> 13:50.871
They're leaving?

13:51.372 --> 13:53.582
They're going to find John B

13:54.333 --> 13:55.334
and your sister.

13:57.920 --> 13:58.921
Come on!

14:01.340 --> 14:02.842
Sucks for them.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.678
That's good for us though.

14:06.428 --> 14:08.848
This may be our only shot
at getting out of here.

14:18.899 --> 14:20.651
- Thank you, Father.
- Thank you very much.

14:25.281 --> 14:29.118
He said you can ring on the hour
for a donation to the collection plate.

14:29.118 --> 14:32.246
- I'll get you back, I swear.
- I only want payment in one way.

14:32.955 --> 14:33.956
You know that.

15:03.611 --> 15:06.071
- They're in there somewhere.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.907
- Find them.
-  Yes, sir.

15:08.449 --> 15:11.952
You three sweep the bottom.
B-team, middle floors. I'll be at the top.

15:15.664 --> 15:17.291
Oh shit!

15:19.043 --> 15:20.085
Go.

15:28.636 --> 15:29.762
Portis!

15:29.762 --> 15:31.180
Are you in here?

15:31.180 --> 15:34.183
Yo, I got them up here!
There's two of them!

15:38.979 --> 15:41.231
I'm going up. You stay down.

15:42.232 --> 15:44.234
-  Where you at, mate?

15:48.238 --> 15:51.075
- Portis?
- Yeah, yeah! Take a left at the hallway.

15:51.742 --> 15:55.371
The stairway's right
on your right.

15:58.374 --> 16:00.376
- He's coming. Y'all ready?
- Yeah.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.086
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:02.086 --> 16:06.006
Hey, remember, you hit him in the legs.
I'm gonna go for the gun.

16:06.006 --> 16:09.635
No, you're too slow.
I go for the gun. You go for the legs.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.095
No. I'm gonna go for the gun.

16:11.095 --> 16:12.888
Why do you have to argue everything?

16:12.888 --> 16:14.765
-  Portis!
- Shh. He's coming.

16:20.646 --> 16:23.899
Up here!
One more flight of stairs now!

16:23.899 --> 16:25.192
You're almost there!

16:26.944 --> 16:29.530
- You're coming, right?
-  Yeah!

16:30.531 --> 16:31.365
Okay!

16:36.412 --> 16:37.246
Portis?

16:37.246 --> 16:40.332
Oh yeah! No, I'm still here.
You just gotta come right in here!

16:40.332 --> 16:41.583
All right, Portis.

16:42.084 --> 16:43.711
-  Come on in!
- I'm coming in!

16:46.130 --> 16:47.840
- Please untie us.
- Help.

16:48.674 --> 16:50.426
All right. Keep your hands still.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.889
- Oh shit, oh shit.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.893
- Hey!

17:02.062 --> 17:02.896
Oh shit.

17:04.815 --> 17:06.775
-  Stop! Freeze!

17:06.775 --> 17:09.278
- Put it down.

17:14.199 --> 17:15.993
Okay, I'm coming!

17:15.993 --> 17:18.037
- This time-- Oh.
-  Don't move! Hold it!

17:18.037 --> 17:20.664
Okay.

17:25.085 --> 17:26.628
Don't even think about it.

17:33.427 --> 17:34.970
Hey, now! Hey, now! Easy!

17:34.970 --> 17:37.681
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I would take it nice and slow now.

17:37.681 --> 17:39.516
It's time for y'all to freeze.

17:40.976 --> 17:41.977
Tie them up.

17:43.645 --> 17:47.483
All right, y'all, let me see those mugs.
This is going to your boss. Smile.

17:48.192 --> 17:50.986
For the record, they thought
this plan wasn't going to work.

17:52.571 --> 17:55.115
- All right, just send that to your boss.

17:55.115 --> 17:56.784
Time for stage three.

17:57.785 --> 17:58.744
Hostage swap.

17:58.744 --> 18:01.246
We're gonna give your boss
a little ring-a-ling, so hang tight.

18:08.754 --> 18:10.047
Mr. Portis.

18:10.631 --> 18:12.966
<i>Do you have Ms. Carrera's friends?</i>

18:15.344 --> 18:16.512
J?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.142
Yeah. Yeah, we... we found them.

18:23.894 --> 18:27.773
Listen, my name is John Booker Routledge.

18:28.482 --> 18:30.484
<i>We have your men tied up</i>,

18:30.484 --> 18:32.903
- and they're in for a really...

18:32.903 --> 18:33.987
...really,

18:34.988 --> 18:36.740
really harsh time

18:36.740 --> 18:39.201
if you don't give us Kiara back right now.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.787
<i>- Like right now. And I mean that.</i>

18:43.038 --> 18:45.040
- Kill them.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.125
What?

18:46.625 --> 18:47.709
<i>Kill them.</i>

18:47.709 --> 18:50.712
<i>Go ahead and kill them,
John Booker Routledge.</i>

18:51.421 --> 18:53.132
<i>It doesn't matter to me, you know.</i>

18:53.132 --> 18:54.508
<i>Just know that if you do,</i>

18:55.342 --> 18:57.094
the hotel is surrounded, you know.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.472
<i>All of you inside will die.</i>

19:03.475 --> 19:04.810
-  We gotta go.
-  Yeah.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.270
We gotta go right now!

19:12.067 --> 19:13.277
Go, go!

19:13.277 --> 19:16.029
- Balcony. Uh, balcony. Bad, so bad.
-  Go, go, go!

19:16.530 --> 19:18.490
- Let's go.
- Got it.

19:20.534 --> 19:22.202
Go back to the main entrance!

19:22.202 --> 19:24.580
- Hold this.
- What are you thinking, Pope?

19:25.164 --> 19:26.748
- Guys.

19:26.748 --> 19:30.127
- Gotta be a better option, right?
- Uh... that's a drop.

19:30.127 --> 19:32.421
This is like the Hawk's Nest part two.
I'm not doing this.

19:32.421 --> 19:35.507
I think we need to think about this
from a risk-reward perspective.

19:35.507 --> 19:37.718
How about you go first
and cushion my fall?

19:37.718 --> 19:40.429
-  How about no?
- Yeah, whatever. Forget this shit!

19:43.640 --> 19:44.558
Okay.

19:44.558 --> 19:46.059
No, no, no! Sarah!

19:48.770 --> 19:51.273
-  You go first, all right?
-  What? No. You go.

19:51.273 --> 19:53.984
-  Clear the next floor!
-  Go, go! This way!

19:54.484 --> 19:56.987
-  Shit!
- Okay, just hold on.

19:56.987 --> 19:58.197
- Yeah. Same time.
- Same time.

20:08.332 --> 20:10.250
- Come on, guys!
- Where's John B?

20:10.250 --> 20:11.460
John B, hurry up, man!

20:29.436 --> 20:31.688
Bring it on home, John B!

20:33.065 --> 20:34.358
Coming, Dad!

20:35.275 --> 20:38.445
-  John B! John B!
-  Come on, hurry!

20:42.157 --> 20:43.242
Hey!

20:43.825 --> 20:46.954
- They're up here!

20:46.954 --> 20:49.706
-  Whoa!

20:51.708 --> 20:54.169
You okay, John B? We gotta go!

20:54.670 --> 20:57.089
- John B! Come on!
-  We gotta go!

20:57.089 --> 20:58.382
Come on, let's go.

20:59.007 --> 21:00.717
- Go, go, go!
-  Oh my God.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.219
- Run!
- Okay, go.

21:07.057 --> 21:07.975
Come on.

21:08.600 --> 21:09.810
Shit!

21:11.019 --> 21:12.062
Okay.

21:17.943 --> 21:19.736
- Stop, stop, stop!
- Whoa!

21:21.238 --> 21:22.948
One second. Hold on.

21:38.880 --> 21:40.048
Let's go, come on.

21:40.924 --> 21:42.676
Just get away from me!

21:42.676 --> 21:45.470
I'm tired of this shit.
I'm gonna kill you, Kie!

21:45.470 --> 21:47.889
-  Help!

21:54.563 --> 21:55.647
Hey, you two!

21:56.565 --> 21:57.691
What'd you do?

22:25.969 --> 22:27.095
What be this?

22:41.777 --> 22:44.196
- Stay down! Stay down, you understand?

22:44.196 --> 22:45.364
Stay down.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.365
Don't move!

22:46.365 --> 22:47.574
Huge mistake.

22:47.574 --> 22:48.784
You'll regret this.

22:48.784 --> 22:50.577
Hey, gimme the phone.

22:51.703 --> 22:54.373
Here, tie him up.

22:57.292 --> 22:59.628
-  Don't move.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.171
Okay. Okay, okay.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.885
Don't make a sound, all right?

23:08.011 --> 23:08.929
Good?

23:14.518 --> 23:17.687
This way. Come on.

23:21.775 --> 23:22.943
Okay. Hey.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.070
Hey. Hey, Rafe.

23:25.070 --> 23:26.822
Rafe. Rafe, Rafe, Rafe.

23:26.822 --> 23:29.241
- What?
- Hey, hey, let me see the phone.

23:29.825 --> 23:31.827
- Why?
- Just give it to me.

23:31.827 --> 23:34.121
Okay. Give me the gun.

23:36.706 --> 23:38.917
You ready?

23:42.295 --> 23:45.006
- Shit.

23:45.006 --> 23:47.551
Okay, this way,
this way, this way.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.560
-  Come on.

23:57.185 --> 23:59.354
Kie, what are you doing?
Let's go! Come on!

23:59.354 --> 24:00.522
Hold on!

24:03.692 --> 24:05.402
- Kie, come on!

24:21.793 --> 24:22.878
Can you see?

24:24.463 --> 24:26.465
I got an idea. Come on, come on!

24:26.465 --> 24:28.049
-  Come on.

24:29.634 --> 24:30.760
Come on!

24:31.803 --> 24:33.096
Come on, come on!

24:38.435 --> 24:40.604
They're slowing down.
Come on, come on!

24:41.438 --> 24:43.106
Go, go, go, go, go.

24:43.815 --> 24:44.816
Let's go!

24:50.071 --> 24:51.239
No. No, no!

24:56.786 --> 24:57.787
Rafe!

25:05.212 --> 25:07.506
- No! Please, don't!
- Don't!

25:26.525 --> 25:27.567
Psst, psst, psst!

25:43.291 --> 25:46.211
-  Go, go, go, go, go, go!
- Bloody rasshole!

25:46.211 --> 25:48.380
Hey, boy, come!

25:48.380 --> 25:49.297
That way. That way!

25:49.297 --> 25:50.632
Shit.

25:53.385 --> 25:55.220
- She know where she's going?
<i>-</i> No clue.

26:04.437 --> 26:05.438
They coming?

26:06.022 --> 26:07.524
I don't see anything.

26:08.191 --> 26:10.860
So what's the plan now? What's our plan B?

26:10.860 --> 26:13.572
We just kicked the hornet's nest.
We gotta think of something quick.

26:13.572 --> 26:15.407
- JJ, calm down.
- Calm down, Pope?

26:16.616 --> 26:19.452
We do something to their guys,
they're gonna do something to Kie.

26:19.452 --> 26:22.163
- That was your idea!
- Yeah, I know that was my idea, okay?

26:22.163 --> 26:25.458
- Shh!
- My bad! That one's on me!

26:27.127 --> 26:28.878
Why did we leave that island?

26:29.546 --> 26:33.800
Ooh, ooh, wait, wait. I got something.
What if I offer myself up as a hostage?

26:33.800 --> 26:35.051
No. Hear me out, hear me out.

26:35.051 --> 26:37.679
What if I got inside the walls,
did the Trojan horse type thing?

26:37.679 --> 26:39.639
- No, no.
- That's how wars are won!

26:39.639 --> 26:41.766
That's not how
a Trojan horse even works!

26:41.766 --> 26:43.560
Okay. Fine. What do you got?

26:43.560 --> 26:46.771
This is usually
where you got the moves, bro, all right?

26:46.771 --> 26:49.107
Remember Spock?
We could really use him right now.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.110
Hey.

26:52.736 --> 26:56.114
What happened back at the hotel?
I thought you got nabbed.

26:57.574 --> 26:58.867
I heard something.

26:59.701 --> 27:00.702
What?

27:02.329 --> 27:03.163
That.

27:04.456 --> 27:06.082
Like that. You hear that, right?

27:06.082 --> 27:07.167
The church bells?

27:08.501 --> 27:09.336
Bells?

27:13.131 --> 27:15.091
My dad used to use them to call me home.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.856
Bring it on home, John B.

27:32.192 --> 27:33.360
Bring it home.

27:40.492 --> 27:43.828
They ran off to the south. We'll get them.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.872
You know
how much this means to me, right?

27:46.790 --> 27:49.751
But if you say you'll get them,
then I don't need to worry.

27:51.002 --> 27:51.920
Do I?

27:52.671 --> 27:53.672
No.

27:56.132 --> 27:57.217
Let's go!

28:13.191 --> 28:15.151
-  Yes, my friend.

28:22.659 --> 28:25.912
-  Yeah. All clear.
-  Let them through!

28:28.081 --> 28:29.165
Watch that. Yeah.

28:41.886 --> 28:43.722
I told you we just had to work together.

28:47.600 --> 28:50.854
All right. Listen,
I'm headed out to my boat, okay?

28:50.854 --> 28:54.107
I can give you a ride out,
drop you wherever, somewhere safe.

28:54.107 --> 28:55.650
- One thing though.

28:55.650 --> 28:57.485
Look at me.

28:58.903 --> 29:02.240
I know your friends are
on the island and my sister.

29:02.907 --> 29:05.660
I'm not helping them.
All right? I can't trust them, okay?

29:05.660 --> 29:07.954
I'll give you a ride out, not them. Okay?

29:09.372 --> 29:10.957
I just want to get off the island.

29:11.458 --> 29:14.586
That's smart.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.631
You know,
I never thought of you as a Pogue.

29:20.759 --> 29:22.343
What did you think of me as?

29:23.344 --> 29:26.556
I mean, I always liked you, Kie.
You're at least half Kook.

29:35.607 --> 29:36.441
<i>Anything?</i>

29:38.651 --> 29:39.486
Nothing.

29:41.863 --> 29:44.365
Sort of the definition of a Hail Mary,
you know?

29:46.659 --> 29:49.037
You have to believe in miracles, John,

29:49.579 --> 29:51.206
if you want them to happen.

30:12.644 --> 30:14.521
Yo, move it, man, what?

30:19.108 --> 30:20.235
Let's go!

30:24.572 --> 30:26.282
Come on. My boat's down here.

30:31.037 --> 30:32.372
Make sure your shoes are off.

30:37.085 --> 30:40.129
Okay, we should have enough juice
to get us to Saint Lucia, no problem.

30:43.758 --> 30:45.301
Hey, get in the boat.

30:49.055 --> 30:49.889
Kie!

30:49.889 --> 30:52.267
You're not gonna pull anything
if I get in?

30:53.184 --> 30:56.104
No, I'm not gonna pull anything, okay?
I'm trying to do you a solid here.

30:56.938 --> 31:00.275
You really wanna be back there with Singh,
or do you wanna be somewhere safe?

31:01.317 --> 31:03.069
Can you help me with the bowline?

31:06.364 --> 31:07.323
Thank you.

31:13.788 --> 31:14.873
All right.

31:15.748 --> 31:17.709
Hey, uh, I... I can't get it.

31:17.709 --> 31:18.918
What?

31:18.918 --> 31:20.211
I need some help!

31:21.170 --> 31:23.381
Goddamn, do I have to do everything?

31:23.965 --> 31:24.841
Okay.

31:26.217 --> 31:27.385
Move.

31:41.274 --> 31:42.817
Kie!

31:42.817 --> 31:43.776
Hey!

31:45.361 --> 31:46.905
Kie! Where are you going?

31:46.905 --> 31:48.865
I've gotta help my friends!

31:48.865 --> 31:52.076
- You don't know what you're doing! Hey!

31:52.076 --> 31:55.580
Shit! I'll find you, Kie! I'll find you!

31:56.331 --> 31:58.416
Kie, you're gonna regret this shit.

31:59.500 --> 32:01.210
Kiara!

32:01.210 --> 32:02.837
You're done!

32:02.837 --> 32:06.549

32:06.549 --> 32:11.012

32:29.238 --> 32:30.448
Hey, guys.

32:31.032 --> 32:32.992
Wake up. Wake up! Guys!

32:32.992 --> 32:34.410
- I got something!

32:34.410 --> 32:36.788
"Meet me at the pin at 6:15. P4L."

32:39.040 --> 32:40.917
We're supposed to believe that's Kiara?

32:40.917 --> 32:44.337
I don't know. This all could be a trap.
It's exactly how he set us up last time.

32:44.337 --> 32:46.923
He knows we got the phone,
and he knows he can't track it so--

32:46.923 --> 32:48.841
We go out there, and bam, he's got us.

32:49.425 --> 32:52.720
- Sometimes you guys can be so stupid.
- I'm sorry?

32:52.720 --> 32:56.307
You get beat so bad you flinch
even when someone's trying to help.

32:57.141 --> 32:59.852
P4L. It's Kiara, man!

32:59.852 --> 33:02.647
No way she sent that as bait.
They'd have to kill her.

33:03.272 --> 33:05.441
We gotta help her. Come on, man.

33:05.441 --> 33:07.777
You're all just sitting there,
just flinching.

33:07.777 --> 33:08.945
Let's go.

33:08.945 --> 33:11.030
I don't know, man.
It could still be a trap.

33:11.030 --> 33:12.907
It's the only option we got.

33:12.907 --> 33:15.243
-  We gotta check, right?
- Let's go.

33:33.886 --> 33:34.971
Get down.

33:36.597 --> 33:38.933
- You got the boats?
- Yeah. You got windows?

33:38.933 --> 33:39.851
- Yeah.
-  Guys.

33:39.851 --> 33:42.228
Singh's men could be posted up
literally anywhere.

33:42.228 --> 33:43.396
No shit.

33:44.939 --> 33:46.024
Guys, is that her?

33:47.775 --> 33:48.901
I don't think so.

33:49.485 --> 33:50.403
Gimme the phone.

33:51.571 --> 33:53.072
I'll take care of this.

33:56.951 --> 34:00.621
That boat, that's the pin.
The white one right there.

34:05.334 --> 34:07.253
- What are you doing?
- There's one way to find out.

34:07.253 --> 34:08.838
-  JJ, JJ!
- Dude!

34:08.838 --> 34:09.881
Stay there!

34:09.881 --> 34:11.340
-  JJ!
-  Hey!

34:11.841 --> 34:14.385
Better to stay hidden
in case he needs help.

34:34.739 --> 34:35.782
JJ?

34:37.533 --> 34:38.618
JJ.

34:39.786 --> 34:41.704
- J.

34:48.544 --> 34:50.296
I'm so glad you're safe.

34:53.925 --> 34:57.845
Wow! I didn't think
I'd see you ever again.

34:57.845 --> 35:00.765
Yeah, but I'm here now.
Okay? It's all right. It's all right.

35:05.937 --> 35:06.938
Guys!

35:12.360 --> 35:13.945
We thought you were dead.

35:16.197 --> 35:17.865
Are you kidding me? Kie...

35:17.865 --> 35:20.076
- Is this you?
- What... what is...

35:20.076 --> 35:22.578
You wouldn't believe it
if I told you. Come on.

35:22.578 --> 35:24.330
- Where'd you get this?
- Holy shit.

35:24.330 --> 35:27.583
-  That's right.

35:37.718 --> 35:40.763
-  John B, let's go!

35:43.474 --> 35:47.728
They were just spotted out at the marina.
Told you we'd get them.

35:47.728 --> 35:49.564
Good. Good.

35:52.316 --> 35:53.985
You know, I never doubted you, you know.

35:57.155 --> 35:59.740
Yeah, so I have
just a couple of questions.

35:59.740 --> 36:03.494
- Go ahead.
- A Lagoon 620 with twin 150 Volvos.

36:03.494 --> 36:06.205
You understand
we can go anywhere with this thing, right?

36:06.205 --> 36:10.251
- I know, kind of a piece of shit.
-  Way to be discreet, by the way.

36:10.251 --> 36:13.421
What did they want anyway?
They didn't hurt you, did they?

36:14.088 --> 36:16.757
No. No, I'm good. It just...

36:16.757 --> 36:19.510
I mean, you're not gonna guess
what Singh wanted from me.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.053
Denmark's Diary.

36:22.346 --> 36:23.723
- Why?
- I don't know.

36:24.348 --> 36:27.310
Said it leads to a treasure
that's a lot bigger than the Merchant.

36:27.310 --> 36:29.437
You're saying there's a bigger treasure?

36:30.563 --> 36:32.565
- Then, sign me up.

36:33.191 --> 36:34.400
Think quick!

36:35.443 --> 36:38.613
- Trying to clock me with this thing?
- Gotta strengthen your reflexes.

36:38.613 --> 36:40.489
Come on, guys! We gotta go!

36:40.489 --> 36:42.950
Feel like my reflexes are already sharp.

36:42.950 --> 36:44.952
She's right. We gotta hurry.

36:50.499 --> 36:52.501
Okay, you definitely heard that, right?

36:54.837 --> 36:56.255
Yeah, I do now.

36:56.881 --> 36:59.467
That's exactly
what my dad would do to call me home.

36:59.467 --> 37:01.636
Sarah, that... that pattern, those bells.

37:03.221 --> 37:05.890
The ding, ding, ding, ding.

37:06.682 --> 37:09.018
Sarah, that... that's him calling me home.

37:09.977 --> 37:11.479
I know, it-- Yeah.

37:12.146 --> 37:13.314
It-- That's--

37:13.814 --> 37:15.358
It's really weird.

37:16.817 --> 37:17.818
But it's not him.

37:17.818 --> 37:20.029
- Okay, how do you know that?
- You know why.

37:20.029 --> 37:22.490
- No, no, no, no. No, no, listen.
- I'm sorry.

37:22.490 --> 37:25.743
Maybe you get beaten enough, you aren't
able to see the miracle in front of you.

37:25.743 --> 37:28.663
I mean, that's exactly
how he used to call me home.

37:28.663 --> 37:32.250
Maybe it is him. Maybe the universe
is trying to give me a gift, and--

37:32.250 --> 37:33.876
- Okay.
- What?

37:34.377 --> 37:36.212
Okay, I get it.

37:36.712 --> 37:39.382
You wanna go to the tower to go look?
Go look.

37:39.382 --> 37:40.633
- Okay?
- You sure?

37:40.633 --> 37:42.093
I'm... I'm serious.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.261
Hurry.

37:44.095 --> 37:45.721
- And take this with you.
- Are you sure?

37:45.721 --> 37:47.807
Yes. Yes.

37:47.807 --> 37:50.685
You don't think I know
what you're like?

37:50.685 --> 37:53.437
You're gonna drive us both insane
if you don't look, so go look.

37:53.437 --> 37:54.522
No, wait.

37:56.023 --> 37:57.692
I love you, Sarah Cameron.

38:01.737 --> 38:02.905
- I'll be back.
- Go.

38:02.905 --> 38:03.990
- Okay.
- Go.

38:04.865 --> 38:05.866
I love you!

38:06.575 --> 38:07.576
I love you.

38:09.912 --> 38:13.040
-  Hey! John B! What are you doing?
- I'll be right back!

38:13.040 --> 38:14.792
-  What are-- What?
- Be right back!
