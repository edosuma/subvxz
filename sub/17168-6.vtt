-Hmm. Um-hmm. Humph.

00:26.393 --> 00:30.195
Wow. Mmm-hmm. Oh, yeah,
that's really interesting. Oh.

00:39.339 --> 00:41.239
-Uh, we're just reading.
-Reading?

00:41.241 --> 00:44.743
Not on this beautiful day!
You're all going outside! Now!

00:44.745 --> 00:46.745
May we first
finish the chapters?

00:46.747 --> 00:49.314
No need! I can tell you how
all your books end.

00:49.316 --> 00:51.349

01:29.288 --> 01:30.989
That was close.

01:30.991 --> 01:33.058
Since it's raining,
we're going to go
back to reading.

01:33.060 --> 01:35.393
Why? What is this
obsession with reading?

01:35.395 --> 01:37.062
I'm really worried about Pop.

01:37.064 --> 01:39.264
They hopped on him
pretty hard, dude.

01:39.266 --> 01:40.732
Can't you see it is raining?

01:40.734 --> 01:43.602
That means, we have to do
rainy day activities.

01:43.604 --> 01:46.705
Those silly boring games
you'd never do, unless
you were trapped inside?

01:46.707 --> 01:48.139
Those aren't any fun.

01:48.141 --> 01:49.941
No, no, no, no, no.
We don't do them for fun.

01:49.943 --> 01:52.911
We do them, because
they are our solemn duty.

01:56.082 --> 01:57.515
(CLEARS THROAT) This is where

01:57.517 --> 01:58.783
someone is supposed
to ask, "Why?"

01:58.785 --> 01:59.818
We're good.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.886
Come on! Just ask, "Why?"

02:01.888 --> 02:02.787

02:02.789 --> 02:04.623
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY) Why?

02:11.564 --> 02:14.032
-I said ask me why!
-(SHOUTING) Why?

02:14.034 --> 02:16.234
(SHOUTING) Why?

02:16.236 --> 02:19.337
Oh, I am so glad
you asked, Beast Boy.

02:19.339 --> 02:20.972
It all starts with rain.

02:20.974 --> 02:24.509
Now, does anyone know
where rain comes from?

02:24.511 --> 02:26.511
-Ooh, ooh.
-Uh, yes, Raven.

02:26.513 --> 02:29.481
Well, when water vapor rises,
air expands and cools off.

02:29.483 --> 02:32.384
The vapor slows
and attaches itself
to tiny particles in the air.

02:32.386 --> 02:34.119
This process continues
and the droplets

02:34.121 --> 02:36.287
become large enough
to be affected by gravity.

02:36.289 --> 02:38.356
Thus, making it rain.

02:38.358 --> 02:39.591
(MOCKING)

02:39.593 --> 02:41.126
That is ludicrous.

02:41.128 --> 02:43.395
Where'd you learn that?
A book?

02:43.397 --> 02:47.999
<i>You see, rain is actually</i>
<i>just the tears of all</i>
<i>the clouds in the sky.</i>

02:54.141 --> 02:55.940

03:02.349 --> 03:03.848
Why didn't you tell us, bro?

03:03.850 --> 03:06.117
-We have to cheer them up!
-Whatever it takes.

03:06.119 --> 03:08.086
(CHUCKLING)
Now, that's the spirit.

Say what? Into the pot I go.

03:32.279 --> 03:34.646

Friends, I am locked
in the cringe position.

03:50.964 --> 03:52.263
I'd love to cheer up
the clouds,

03:52.265 --> 03:54.365
but not at the expense
of our dignity.

03:54.367 --> 03:55.834
Fine! Leave!

03:55.836 --> 03:57.702
I just don't know how
I'm going to drink

03:57.704 --> 04:01.506
all this chocolate milk
by myself.

04:01.508 --> 04:04.375
(GASPS) You have
the brown milk?

04:04.377 --> 04:05.510
Oh, this?

04:05.512 --> 04:07.378
The milk monitor brought
this from the cafeteria

04:07.380 --> 04:09.614
to fuel our
rainy day activities.

04:09.616 --> 04:11.716

04:53.393 --> 04:56.127
But, it appears that
the clouds are still crying.

down and raises a thumb.

one person each.

who picked them.
