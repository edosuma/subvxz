09:05.878 --> 09:06.963
HERE.

09:07.046 --> 09:09.799
STRETCH OUT ON THE COUCH.

09:09.882 --> 09:12.885
NOW, I NEED A PLACE TO SIT.

09:12.969 --> 09:17.014
I'LL JUST SIT IN THIS ARMCHAIR
I DON'T REMEMBER BUYING.

09:17.098 --> 09:18.432
THIS NEW CHAIR IS PRETTY SWEET,

09:18.516 --> 09:22.270
BUT I THINK I WANT TO
PUT MY FEET UP.

09:22.353 --> 09:24.230
I WONDER IF IT DOES MASSAGE.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.732
- NO, IT DOESN'T.

09:26.816 --> 09:27.984
- THAT'S OKAY.

09:28.067 --> 09:30.820
- A LOCAL SCHOOLTEACHER
APPEARS TO BE THE LATEST VICTIM

09:30.903 --> 09:34.615
OF THE RUNAWAY APE THAT HAS BEEN
TERRORIZING THE CITY.

09:34.699 --> 09:35.283
- [gibbering]

09:35.366 --> 09:38.286
GET A GRIP ON YOURSELF.

09:38.369 --> 09:41.956
THE RINGMASTER'S COMING FOR
DINNER AND I MADE PEANUTS.

09:42.039 --> 09:43.541

09:43.624 --> 09:46.002
THAT MONKEY'S BOPPING STUFF.

09:46.085 --> 09:51.132
HEY, IT KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE CHIMP CHOMP.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.009
BUT THAT CAN'T BE

09:53.092 --> 09:57.179
BECAUSE YOU'RE HERE,
SAFELY BY MY SIDE.

09:57.263 --> 09:58.597
HEY, A SHOW ABOUT BOOKS.

09:58.681 --> 10:01.183

10:01.267 --> 10:02.685

10:08.774 --> 10:10.526

I'M EXHAUSTED.

10:10.609 --> 10:13.070
BOOG PLAYED ME ALL THE WAY

10:13.154 --> 10:14.697
- LEVEL 15?

10:14.780 --> 10:16.365
HOW WAS IT?

10:16.449 --> 10:19.618
- IT WAS AWESOME!

10:19.702 --> 10:20.703
- AWESOME?

10:20.786 --> 10:24.498
OOH, THAT DOES SOUND AWESOME.

10:24.582 --> 10:26.542
[rooster crowing]

10:26.625 --> 10:29.170
I CAN'T BELIEVE WE MADE IT
ALL THE WAY TO LEVEL 2!

10:29.253 --> 10:30.379
- BEEP, BEEP.

10:30.463 --> 10:34.717
FANBOY, KEEP IT DOWN
OR WE MIGHT WAKE UP BOOG.

10:36.927 --> 10:39.221
- YEAH, AND THEN
HE MIGHT BOP YOU.

10:39.305 --> 10:40.348
- EXACTLY.

10:40.431 --> 10:44.352
HE PROBABLY WILL BOP YOU.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.478
[yelling]

10:45.561 --> 10:46.729
UH-OH.

10:46.812 --> 10:49.732

THE REAL CHIMP CHOMP IS,

10:49.815 --> 10:51.942
AND NOBODY GETS HURT.

10:52.026 --> 10:53.069
- UH, LOOK UP.
LOOK DOWN.

10:53.152 --> 10:53.569
I'M ON A GOAT!

10:53.652 --> 10:56.364
- [brays]

10:56.447 --> 11:00.159
- LOOKS LIKE I'M WORKING A
DOUBLE SHIFT AT THE BOP FACTORY.

11:00.242 --> 11:01.744
- [whimpering]

11:01.827 --> 11:03.079
RELEASE MONKEY?

11:03.162 --> 11:05.081
I WONDER WHAT DOES.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.251
OH, IT RELEASES THE MONKEY.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.295
[shrieking]

11:11.379 --> 11:13.255

[yelling]

11:15.674 --> 11:17.259
[laughter]

11:17.343 --> 11:18.386
- SO LONG, BOOG.

11:18.469 --> 11:21.138
HAVE FUN WITH THE GORILLA
YOUR DREAMS.

11:21.222 --> 11:26.060
- YEAH, GOOD LUCK GETTING
THAT MONKEY OFF YOUR BACK!

11:26.143 --> 11:28.479
OH, OR IS THAT YOUR BUTT?

11:28.562 --> 11:31.190
- EITHER WAY, IT DOES
LOOK PRETTY PAINFUL.

11:31.273 --> 11:33.359
WE BETTER GO.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.945
- [yelling]

11:36.028 --> 11:37.279
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:37.363 --> 11:38.989
LENNY, GET OUT HERE AND HELP ME!

11:39.073 --> 11:41.242
- HOLD YOUR HORSES.

11:41.325 --> 11:42.201
I'M ON THE CRISPER.

11:54.422 --> 11:57.133
- HOW AM I EVER GOING TO
PASS THIS TEST?

11:57.216 --> 11:58.467
UGH.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.136

12:08.227 --> 12:10.604
- WOW!

12:10.688 --> 12:17.027

12:21.824 --> 12:26.162
- WELL, I WAS STUDYING
FOR THE M.A.T.s.

12:26.245 --> 12:27.371

12:27.455 --> 12:29.707
WHAT'S THAT?

12:29.790 --> 12:32.501
- AND A FOLLOW-UP QUESTION:
WHAT IS STUDYING?

12:32.585 --> 12:36.005
- M.A.T.s, THE MILKWEED
ADMITTANCE TEST.

12:36.088 --> 12:37.673
ONCE I PASS THE EXAM,

12:37.756 --> 12:42.344
I INTEND TO REMATRICULATE
AT MY ALMA MATER POSTHASTE.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.096
- KYLE'S TALKING GIBBERISH.

12:44.180 --> 12:47.183
- SOUNDS LIKE SOMEONE'S
BLOOD SUGAR'S A LITTLE LOW.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.350

12:48.434 --> 12:52.354
LET'S GO BAKE
KYLE A STUDY SNACK.

12:52.438 --> 12:53.731
HOPE YOU LIKE LEFTOVERS.

12:53.814 --> 12:57.610
ALL WE FOUND WAS THIS CONTAINER
THAT SAYS "FLAN.

12:57.693 --> 13:00.654
DO NOT OPEN
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES."

13:00.738 --> 13:02.740
BUT YOU LOOK PRETTY HUNGRY,
SO I'LL MAKE AN EXCEPTION.

- HELLO, PROFESSOR FLAN.

13:27.515 --> 13:28.807
YOU'RE LOOKING WELL.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.393
- NO THANKS TO YOU.

13:31.477 --> 13:35.856
FIRST YOU TURN ME
INTO RASPBERRY FLAN.

13:35.940 --> 13:41.195
THEN YOU STUFF ME IN A CONTAINER

14:01.215 --> 14:02.591
both: HM?

14:02.675 --> 14:07.263

14:15.187 --> 14:20.276
AND YOU HAD BETTER GET
EVERY SINGLE QUESTION CORRECT

14:20.359 --> 14:23.696

15:44.109 --> 15:45.736
FIRST THE WIZARD BECOMES A BABY,

15:45.819 --> 15:48.030
THEN HE MUST FALL ASLEEP
IN THE ENCHANTED CRIB.

15:48.113 --> 15:51.950
ONLY THEN
WILL THE CRIB NOTES APPEAR.

15:52.034 --> 15:53.869
- WELL, THAT'S EASY ENOUGH.

15:53.952 --> 15:58.207
JUST SCOOTCH DOWN WITH YOUR

IT SEEMS I'M NOT
SUFFICIENTLY FATIGUED.
