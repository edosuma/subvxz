00:29.579 --> 00:32.268
WOMAN: Ron, do I have to keep my hand
pressed on the red button?

00:32.348 --> 00:34.103
- What?
- I don't have to keep my hand

00:34.183 --> 00:36.345
- pressed on the red button?
- No.

00:43.025 --> 00:46.655
MAN: ...shut his eyes tight shut.

00:46.762 --> 00:48.993
Huffed and puffed.

00:55.971 --> 01:00.773
Oh, but the candle barely flickered,
and there were 39 left to go.

01:03.612 --> 01:05.099
WOMAN: Can you guys say good night to me?

01:05.180 --> 01:06.801
MAN: Can you say, "Good night, Mommy"?

01:06.881 --> 01:08.770
BOY: Good-bye.

01:08.850 --> 01:10.772
WOMAN: Good night, angel.

01:10.852 --> 01:13.344
- Good-bye, good night.
- Good night.

01:13.455 --> 01:15.219
MAN: Okay, blow Mommy a kiss.

01:32.240 --> 01:35.005
- No!
- Mommy, pick Owen up.

01:36.845 --> 01:39.668
- Get me up.
- Okay, you can both come up.

01:39.748 --> 01:42.912
MAN: Okay. One big, happy family

01:43.018 --> 01:46.386
about to go into the water.

01:46.488 --> 01:48.581
- You want to say hi to Mommy?
- Hi, Mom.

01:48.689 --> 01:50.590
- WOMAN: Hi, guys.
- I want to watch a video.

01:50.691 --> 01:53.180
You want to watch a video?
Well, I'm taking a video

01:53.260 --> 01:57.823
of you guys reading
The Biggest Birthday Cake in the World.

01:58.098 --> 02:02.866
...last book reading,
which we do every single night.

02:23.791 --> 02:26.852
Walt Disney Pictures.

02:29.430 --> 02:34.425
Okay, our next film
is a wonderful children's film.

02:47.313 --> 02:48.713
And the Academy Award...

02:56.756 --> 03:01.160
So what we're gonna do today,
when you're out in the community, right?

03:01.260 --> 03:04.128
When you're... Next year,
when you're making appointments

03:04.230 --> 03:07.826
and having to find locations,
you always have to be...

03:07.934 --> 03:10.556
- Aware.
- Aware, right.

03:10.636 --> 03:12.558
So when we're walking
through the community,

03:12.638 --> 03:15.261
what's our posture for walking?

03:15.341 --> 03:16.468
- This.
- Okay.

03:16.576 --> 03:19.136
- What about our chins? Where are they?
- Chin up.

03:19.245 --> 03:23.808
Where's the safest place to cross?
Go back and forth across Main Street?

03:23.916 --> 03:28.149
- I-I can... I need help here.
- Okay. Who wants to help him?

03:28.254 --> 03:30.018
- I'll do it.
- Go ahead.

03:30.123 --> 03:31.648
- The crosswalk.
- Crosswalk.

03:31.758 --> 03:33.521
- The crosswalk.
- You're right.

03:33.625 --> 03:35.580
So next year you'll be more independent,

03:35.660 --> 03:37.595
and you'll have more choices to make.

03:41.099 --> 03:45.628
I've got to teach my son a lesson.

03:47.272 --> 03:50.299
My name is Owen Suskind.

03:52.544 --> 03:56.802
I'll be graduating in a month.

03:56.882 --> 04:01.946
Then I'll be moving and living
into an apartment of my own.

04:05.891 --> 04:07.860
...since Beauty and the Beast...

04:17.302 --> 04:18.457
I'm home!

04:18.536 --> 04:20.665
- Yay, buddy.
- Owen!

04:20.805 --> 04:23.037
Owen, I just got back
from the grocery store.

04:23.141 --> 04:25.041
- Oh, that's great.
- What would you like for lunch?

04:25.142 --> 04:29.807
A grilled ham and cheese.
Excuse me, I need to find...

04:30.381 --> 04:32.714
- Your apples, right?
- Okay.

04:32.817 --> 04:34.338
Owen, your sandwich is over there, bud.

04:34.418 --> 04:37.508
Thanks. And I'll get three
Chips Ahoy! cookies.

04:37.588 --> 04:39.176
Okay.

04:39.256 --> 04:42.420
You got a big rite of passage
coming with graduation.

04:42.526 --> 04:45.182
You're gonna be out of school.

04:45.262 --> 04:48.562
Now we can start thinking
a little more about the future?

04:48.666 --> 04:52.323
- Yeah, yeah.
- How's that feel?

04:52.403 --> 04:54.859
A little nervous and a little exciting.

04:54.939 --> 04:57.408
A little nervous and a little exciting.

05:33.776 --> 05:35.608
I'm so glad you came back tonight.

05:35.712 --> 05:38.272
- I might never have seen you.
- Why?

05:38.381 --> 05:40.111
Because I have to grow up tomorrow.

05:40.216 --> 05:41.371
Grow up?

05:41.451 --> 05:43.477
Tonight's my last night in the nursery.

05:43.586 --> 05:46.454
But that means no more stories.

05:48.224 --> 05:49.913
No, I won't have it!

05:49.993 --> 05:51.714
Come on.

05:51.794 --> 05:54.821
- But where are we going?
- To Neverland.

05:59.068 --> 06:00.832
I'll run him through.

06:01.971 --> 06:02.961
Take that.

06:10.946 --> 06:12.574
Blast this hook.

06:14.283 --> 06:15.774
Come on, everybody.

06:19.488 --> 06:20.922
Hurry, Michael!

06:22.424 --> 06:25.519
Don't stand there, you bilge rats!

06:25.627 --> 06:28.426
Get those scurvy brats!

06:42.110 --> 06:43.806
Oh, no!

06:46.882 --> 06:48.817
WOMAN: Daddy and Owen...

06:50.953 --> 06:54.515
Fighting with swords in the leaves.

06:56.358 --> 06:58.520
MAN: Owen, who are you?

06:58.627 --> 06:59.815
I'm Peter Pan.

06:59.895 --> 07:00.948
And you're Captain Hook.

07:01.028 --> 07:02.724
Oh, I'm Captain Hook. You're Peter Pan.

07:02.830 --> 07:06.358
Okay. Come on, Pan, you demon.

07:11.539 --> 07:14.031
There's a video we came across,

07:15.509 --> 07:18.707
and then once we found it,
we couldn't stop watching it.

07:18.813 --> 07:23.410
Oh, thank you, thank you.
That's very chivalrous of you.

07:27.021 --> 07:31.012
Now, in a way, it's just
an unremarkable video

07:31.092 --> 07:32.847
of a dad and a son playing.

07:32.927 --> 07:36.317
I'm chasing Owen around.
He's chasing me around.

07:36.397 --> 07:38.423
He's Peter Pan. I'm Captain Hook.

07:38.532 --> 07:40.057
Oh, no!

07:42.703 --> 07:46.694
At the time we shot it,
I'm in my early 30s.

07:46.774 --> 07:51.165
I'm a reporter
for The Wall Street Journal,

07:51.245 --> 07:55.238
and our life is taking shape
just the way we'd wanted.

07:55.348 --> 07:58.838
We had two beautiful boys.
We'd just had our second boy.

07:58.918 --> 08:03.176
We had a little, tiny house,
but it was just, like, our dream house.

08:03.256 --> 08:04.952
You want to say hi to Mommy?

08:05.058 --> 08:06.546
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, guys.

08:06.626 --> 08:09.460
You know, everything
was falling into place.

08:19.606 --> 08:22.562
But all of a sudden,

08:22.642 --> 08:26.545
at three years old, Owen vanishes.

08:28.481 --> 08:30.473
CORNELIA: Good-bye, Peter Pan!

08:47.299 --> 08:51.794
Owen just started changing really fast.

08:51.904 --> 08:55.094
You know, he wasn't sleeping.
That was the first thing.

08:55.174 --> 09:00.545
He'd be up in the middle of the night,
and then he'd be up all night.

09:00.646 --> 09:04.344
His motor skills were deteriorating,

09:04.450 --> 09:08.073
and then his language
processing broke down.

09:08.153 --> 09:11.282
He just started reciting this gibberish.

09:14.626 --> 09:17.357
OWEN: It was hard for me to
understand what people were saying.

09:18.330 --> 09:21.027
They were all garbled.

09:22.835 --> 09:25.862
- Owen! Owen!
- Owen!

09:30.175 --> 09:31.871
Owen!

09:34.780 --> 09:39.217
It's like... We're looking for clues
to a kidnapping.

09:39.317 --> 09:43.474
Someone kidnapped our son.

09:43.554 --> 09:45.977
CORNELIA: We went to the pediatrician,

09:46.057 --> 09:48.112
but he had no idea what he was looking at.

09:48.192 --> 09:51.649
He said, "You're out of my league."

09:51.729 --> 09:54.619
So we go see the specialist.

09:54.699 --> 09:57.726
It's not a pediatrician's office
like you're used to going to.

09:57.835 --> 10:01.292
It's one that has
a special room with a window

10:01.372 --> 10:06.572
to observe children like guinea pigs.

10:06.677 --> 10:11.706
The doctor has Owen walk down
a long hall from me to Cornelia,

10:11.816 --> 10:14.639
and I just want to say, you know,

10:14.719 --> 10:19.054
"Just walk like you used to walk."

10:19.157 --> 10:21.179
Like, I'm whispering that to him.

10:21.259 --> 10:26.288
"Okay, buddy, just walk
like you know how to walk,"

10:26.397 --> 10:29.060
and I let go of him,

10:29.167 --> 10:32.823
and he just weaves down the hall,

10:32.903 --> 10:36.772
like someone walking with their eyes shut.

10:39.376 --> 10:41.865
And he gets to the end,
and Cornelia grabs his hand.

10:41.945 --> 10:46.169
I remember literally just,
like, holding him in a bear hug

10:46.249 --> 10:48.514
and just thinking, you know,

10:50.287 --> 10:53.343
"I'm just gonna hold you so tight,

10:53.423 --> 10:58.293
and love you so much that
whatever is going on will go away."

11:04.034 --> 11:08.472
RON: The doctor says, "He has a
pervasive developmental disorder,"

11:10.040 --> 11:12.805
and she says the word "autism."

11:12.909 --> 11:16.700
It was... It was devastating.

11:16.780 --> 11:20.570
It was completely devastating.

11:20.650 --> 11:22.104
RON: Then after a few minutes, she says,

11:22.184 --> 11:25.120
"Some of the kids never
get their speech back.

11:25.221 --> 11:27.850
They don't ever talk again."

11:27.957 --> 11:31.413
And we just looked down at him
and the kid playing on the rug,

11:31.493 --> 11:33.655
looking at his hands,
and the doctor saying,

11:33.762 --> 11:37.062
"So let me explain what autism is."

11:40.336 --> 11:45.060
WOMAN 2: Look what we have here!
What is this, Owen?

11:45.140 --> 11:47.006
What do you have here?

11:49.478 --> 11:51.600
Hey, what do these look like?

11:51.680 --> 11:54.470
Oh, let's get this away. All right.

11:54.550 --> 11:59.784
All right, we need to stop sillies.
You need... Owen.

12:05.427 --> 12:08.795
MAN 2: I first met Owen
when he was three years old.

12:10.366 --> 12:13.700
At that point, I think that Ron
and Cornelia were devastated.

12:15.570 --> 12:18.593
I think that it shattered
their ideal vision

12:18.673 --> 12:23.097
of who this child is going to become.

12:23.177 --> 12:26.909
The image of autism in the early 1990s,

12:27.015 --> 12:29.304
uh, was not terribly flattering.

12:29.384 --> 12:33.641
So they're looking for any glimmer of hope

12:33.721 --> 12:36.778
that there are other
possibilities out there

12:36.858 --> 12:41.950
besides an adult that
will be forever dependent.

12:42.030 --> 12:45.320
The child with autism
is easily overstimulated.

12:45.400 --> 12:49.357
They don't filter the constant stimuli

12:49.437 --> 12:51.736
that come in on a daily basis.

12:51.839 --> 12:55.964
This world is just too intense
for their brains,

12:56.044 --> 12:58.166
and that's always what I felt about Owen,

12:58.246 --> 13:01.876
especially when he was a tiny baby.

13:01.983 --> 13:03.713
You know, the vacuum cleaner would go on,

13:03.818 --> 13:08.809
the visual stimulation,
the auditory stimulation.

13:08.889 --> 13:13.513
So imagine how difficult it would
be to just do the simplest things

13:13.593 --> 13:16.563
if you have this
constant noise in your brain.

13:17.664 --> 13:21.431
RON: Owen, Owen, Owen.

13:22.502 --> 13:23.993
Owen, look.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.863
When your child goes
into their adult living,

13:29.943 --> 13:31.275
they've also been in an environment

13:31.378 --> 13:33.574
where the adults have
been telling them a lot.

13:33.680 --> 13:37.204
So now it's gonna be
your turn in a couple of months

13:37.284 --> 13:40.448
to start you telling them things
about what you want to do

13:40.554 --> 13:42.509
and what, you know,
what you're comfortable with...

13:42.589 --> 13:44.845
what you don't want to do,
what you do want to do.

13:44.925 --> 13:48.548
So a lot of those choices that maybe
you only had one or two choices here,

13:48.628 --> 13:50.717
now you're gonna have lots of choices.

13:50.797 --> 13:53.353
I have some concerns as far as safety.

13:53.433 --> 13:57.524
Owen tends to walk with
his chin down and plow ahead,

13:57.604 --> 14:01.131
like when he comes out
between cars in a parking lot

14:01.240 --> 14:04.472
- or going to cross the street.
- Yeah.

14:06.278 --> 14:11.070
Hey, Owen, what would you say is
your greatest concern about next year?

14:11.150 --> 14:15.144
That I have to do stuff all on my own.

14:15.254 --> 14:17.450
- That's a concern?
- Yeah.

14:17.556 --> 14:19.578
- To change, right?
- To change.

14:19.658 --> 14:22.822
But is it worth it not having
a staff live with you?

14:22.928 --> 14:24.920
- A little bit.
- I bet.

14:35.174 --> 14:36.972
How do you feel?

14:37.076 --> 14:41.138
I would say a little nervous
'cause it's a new thing for me,

14:41.247 --> 14:44.684
doing my own things on my own.

14:44.784 --> 14:46.072
Yeah, well, this is the big step.

14:46.152 --> 14:49.020
This is your step through the adult door.

14:49.121 --> 14:52.077
Now you're no different than me.
So you kind of...

14:52.157 --> 14:54.490
All these decisions are gonna be you.

14:54.592 --> 14:56.993
They're gonna be for me.

14:57.095 --> 14:58.085
You got to remember,

14:59.130 --> 15:01.326
even though it might seem
like you're kind of on your own,

15:01.433 --> 15:02.526
and there's no dorm counselor...

15:02.634 --> 15:03.624
Yep.

15:04.135 --> 15:05.590
...we're still just a call away, right?

15:05.670 --> 15:06.968
Right.

15:11.009 --> 15:13.465
Pretty excited of what's
gonna happen for you, bud.

15:13.545 --> 15:14.535
Yeah.

15:14.646 --> 15:15.875
You got a lot more chapters to write.

15:15.980 --> 15:18.449
A lot more chapters to write.

15:26.491 --> 15:28.357
- OWEN: I'll be the tosser.
- Watch how I'm doing it.

15:28.460 --> 15:30.148
If you hold it in your hand like this...

15:30.228 --> 15:31.316
Yeah?

15:31.396 --> 15:32.650
Gus, over there.

15:32.730 --> 15:33.785
Good boy.

15:33.865 --> 15:34.889
Good boy, come on.

15:34.999 --> 15:36.399
- Good boy.
- Come on, boy.

15:36.501 --> 15:38.868
- Come on, Gus.
- Come on, buddy.

15:38.970 --> 15:41.735
- Fetch, Gus. Fetch, Gus.
- Where is it, Gus?

16:02.326 --> 16:06.093
- RON: There's Mommy and Owe.
- Having a little pizza.

16:06.196 --> 16:07.687
Big bite.

16:17.374 --> 16:20.572
We're about a year along into his silence.

16:20.677 --> 16:23.579
The only thing we seem
to be able to do as a family

16:23.680 --> 16:27.504
is the one thing Owen and Walter liked
to do before the onset of the autism.

16:27.584 --> 16:31.248
They loved to watch
the Disney animated movies.

16:31.355 --> 16:36.712
We realized that was the only thing
that was keeping Owen calm

16:36.792 --> 16:41.884
and making him happy, and so Owen
and his older brother Walter

16:41.964 --> 16:44.297
would watch these together.

16:46.269 --> 16:48.636
I didn't know what autism was.
I just knew that autism made

16:48.738 --> 16:49.892
Owen the way he is.

16:49.972 --> 16:54.063
So autism kind of just meant different...
drastically different.

16:54.143 --> 16:59.946
So Disney was my chance to have
Owen really light up around me

17:00.049 --> 17:02.746
and was something
we can come together over.

17:05.454 --> 17:07.710
RON: So, one day, we're up in the bedroom.

17:07.790 --> 17:09.712
We're watching The Little Mermaid.

17:09.791 --> 17:12.882
CORNELIA: And, you know, Owen
would be speaking sort of gibberish,

17:12.962 --> 17:15.659
and he had been saying,
"Juicervose, juicervose, juicervose."

17:15.765 --> 17:18.826
He's murmuring something called...
He's saying, "Juicervose, juicervose."

17:18.935 --> 17:20.961
Now, Cornelia thinks he wants more juice.

17:21.069 --> 17:23.726
She gives him the sippy cup.
He doesn't want it. He knocks it over.

17:23.806 --> 17:25.761
It's gibberish.

17:25.840 --> 17:29.064
Owen's watching the part
where Ariel, the mermaid,

17:29.144 --> 17:31.477
has to trade something to become human.

17:31.580 --> 17:34.482
Go ahead. Make your choice.

17:34.583 --> 17:37.644
I'm a very busy woman,
and I haven't got all day

17:37.752 --> 17:40.745
It won't cost much, just your voice.

17:42.824 --> 17:45.589
RON: Owen rewinds. Walt's like,
"Owen, just watch the movie."

17:46.461 --> 17:47.986
Owen rewinds a second time.

17:48.096 --> 17:50.156
Third time, Cornelia grabs me and says,

17:50.265 --> 17:53.088
"It's not 'juice.'" I said,
"What?" "It's not 'juice.' It's 'just.'"

17:53.168 --> 17:54.693
Just your voice.

17:54.803 --> 17:58.627
I grab Owen, and I say, "Just your voice."

17:58.707 --> 18:00.795
And he says, "Juicervose,
juicervose, juice..."

18:00.875 --> 18:03.936
It's the first time
he looks at me in a year.

18:06.881 --> 18:10.138
Of course, we read every possible meaning

18:10.218 --> 18:13.711
into the fact he picks those three words.

18:13.822 --> 18:15.977
"Just your voice."

18:16.057 --> 18:20.460
Silent child. The first thing he says.

18:22.997 --> 18:27.059
He's still in there. He's still in there.

18:29.036 --> 18:31.062
We go and see a doctor,

18:31.171 --> 18:34.369
and we tell him about
our amazing "juicervose" moment,

18:34.475 --> 18:36.740
and he's like, "Well,
let me explain this to you.

18:36.844 --> 18:42.078
"This is... You better sit down.
I know you're very pumped up here,

18:42.182 --> 18:44.242
but this is called echolalia."

18:44.351 --> 18:48.254
This isn't like a breakthrough,
you know. It's... It's echolalia,

18:48.355 --> 18:52.479
which is just the repeating
of language that they hear.

18:52.559 --> 18:55.893
RON: And I said, "Like a parrot?"
And he's like, "Well, kind of, yeah."

18:57.331 --> 19:00.392
Is it possible he knows what he's saying?

19:00.501 --> 19:04.734
And the doctor says, "Maybe.
But there's no way of knowing,

19:04.838 --> 19:07.933
and the thinking is, probably not."

19:10.577 --> 19:13.910
At that point, Cornelia and I

19:14.013 --> 19:16.536
were set on a rescue mission

19:16.616 --> 19:19.916
to get inside this prison of autism

19:21.587 --> 19:24.691
and pull him out.

19:42.942 --> 19:44.934
Okay. Okay, listen up.

19:45.044 --> 19:47.400
Soon as everyone gets here, we will begin.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.278
- Hey, Owen?
- Yeah?

19:49.382 --> 19:51.146
MAN 3: Could I just recommend that
instead of saying, "Listen up,"

19:51.250 --> 19:53.116
say, "May I have your attention, please?"

19:53.219 --> 19:55.984
May I have your attention, please?
When everyone gets here, we'll begin.

19:56.089 --> 20:00.747
I started a Disney club so
I can get to know more people,

20:00.827 --> 20:05.491
and they can be around me,
so I can be more popular.

20:05.597 --> 20:07.552
It worked!

20:07.632 --> 20:09.624
Tonight we're watching
some of The Lion King,

20:09.735 --> 20:13.091
because this year
is the big 20th anniversary

20:13.171 --> 20:16.061
of the original release of The Lion King.

20:16.141 --> 20:18.730
- Shall we?
- Of course.

20:18.810 --> 20:21.644
Not only am I a big Disney fanatic,

20:21.747 --> 20:26.071
but I also like to play magical
movie scores on this piano.

20:26.151 --> 20:28.120
OWEN: Yeah!

20:31.923 --> 20:35.280
We watch parts of Disney animated films

20:35.360 --> 20:40.094
and discuss them and see what
they're really about in our lives.

20:52.444 --> 20:55.599
That's not my father.
It's just my reflection.

20:55.679 --> 20:58.436
No.

20:58.516 --> 21:01.315
Look harder.

21:02.386 --> 21:03.808
Look.

21:03.888 --> 21:07.552
- You see?
- You see?

21:07.658 --> 21:11.220
He lives in you.

21:13.564 --> 21:15.533
I'm not who I used to be.

21:15.633 --> 21:19.824
Remember who you are.

21:19.904 --> 21:24.467
You are my son and the one true king.

21:25.543 --> 21:28.966
Remember who you are.

21:29.046 --> 21:33.245
- No, please, don't leave me.
- Remember.

21:33.350 --> 21:35.080
- Father.
- Remember.

21:35.186 --> 21:37.417
- Don't leave me.
- Okay.

21:38.689 --> 21:43.013
What was Mufasa teaching Simba? Jessica?

21:43.093 --> 21:48.554
They're teaching us that there's more
to you than you ever would see.

21:48.665 --> 21:51.187
And there's more
than meets the eye, right?

21:51.267 --> 21:52.989
More than meets the eye.

21:53.069 --> 21:55.766
Their parents are teaching how,
when you grow up,

21:55.872 --> 21:57.861
to... to be on your own and...

21:57.941 --> 22:01.275
and how to learn how to,
like, live on your own.

22:01.377 --> 22:03.937
Yeah. It's important

22:04.047 --> 22:07.745
that when our parents
no longer can help us,

22:07.851 --> 22:10.840
that we have to figure
things out by ourselves.

22:10.920 --> 22:12.252
Yeah.

22:31.741 --> 22:36.145
RON: Four years have passed
since our "juicervose" moment.

22:36.246 --> 22:40.649
Owen has said almost nothing
but gibberish since then.

22:40.749 --> 22:44.982
We're beginning to give up hope.

22:45.087 --> 22:49.718
So on Walt's ninth birthday,
he's in the backyard with his buddies.

22:51.260 --> 22:54.216
Party ends, the kids leave,

22:54.296 --> 22:56.993
and Walt gets a little weepy,
a little emotional,

22:57.099 --> 23:01.298
and then Owen follows us
into the kitchen, looking expectant.

23:01.403 --> 23:02.894
Like, he's looking at the two of us.

23:03.739 --> 23:08.397
He stands there, stock still,
like something's bubbling up,

23:08.477 --> 23:10.673
and he says,

23:10.779 --> 23:13.735
"Walter doesn't want to grow up

23:13.815 --> 23:17.183
like Mowgli or Peter Pan,"
and off he runs.

23:17.286 --> 23:21.189
I was like, "What the hell just happened?

23:21.290 --> 23:23.779
"Did Owen just say,
'Walter doesn't want to grow up,

23:23.859 --> 23:25.987
like Peter Pan or Mowgli'?"

23:26.094 --> 23:28.029
Peter Pan doesn't want to grow up

23:28.130 --> 23:30.953
'cause he wants to stay
a boy and be in Neverland.

23:31.033 --> 23:34.196
Once you're grown up,
you can never come back.

23:34.302 --> 23:36.457
Never.

23:36.537 --> 23:40.872
I felt the same way that Walter felt
when he was nine at teeny, tiny bits.

23:40.975 --> 23:44.599
When you grow up,
you lose all your magical,

23:44.679 --> 23:47.308
enchanted childhood times.

23:48.783 --> 23:50.342
This wasn't just a sentence.

23:50.451 --> 23:55.515
This was a complex sentence
of a complex thought,

23:55.623 --> 23:58.446
of something that we didn't even see,

23:58.526 --> 24:01.360
and all the sudden it became clear to us.

24:01.462 --> 24:03.784
He's using these movies

24:03.864 --> 24:07.699
to make sense of the world
he actually is living in: our world.

24:07.802 --> 24:10.795
CORNELIA: But I said to Ron, "You
know, we've got to try and figure out

24:10.972 --> 24:13.305
if we can have him talk to us at all."

24:15.710 --> 24:17.508
RON: So I go up to his room.

24:18.245 --> 24:21.807
I see Owen on the bed,
flipping through a Disney book,

24:23.150 --> 24:26.473
and I see, sort of over to my left...

24:26.553 --> 24:29.476
I see Iago, the puppet.

24:29.556 --> 24:34.481
Now, Iago is the evil sidekick
to the villain Jafar from Aladdin.

24:34.561 --> 24:39.431
- Now, I know Owen loves this puppet.
- Jafar, Jafar! Get a grip!

24:40.367 --> 24:44.270
I grab the puppet,
I pull it up to my elbow,

24:44.371 --> 24:47.830
and I begin to crawl across
the rug as quietly as I can,

24:48.842 --> 24:50.997
and Owen turns to the puppet

24:51.077 --> 24:54.241
like he's bumping into an old friend.

24:54.347 --> 24:56.748
I say to him, "Owen, Owen,

24:56.850 --> 25:00.840
how does it feel to be you?"

25:00.920 --> 25:05.255
And I said, "Not good,
'cause I don't have any friends."

25:06.192 --> 25:08.593
Now, I'm under the bedspread,

25:08.695 --> 25:14.521
and I just bite down hard, you know.

25:14.601 --> 25:18.765
I just say to myself, "Stay in character,"

25:18.871 --> 25:21.431
and I say, "Okay, okay.

25:21.540 --> 25:25.102
"Owen, when did you and I

25:25.210 --> 25:28.901
become such good friends?"

25:28.981 --> 25:33.372
And he said, "When I watched Aladdin,
you made me laugh."

25:33.452 --> 25:38.544
And then we talk, Owen and Iago,

25:38.624 --> 25:41.046
for a minute, minute and a half.

25:41.126 --> 25:46.793
It's the first conversation
we've ever had.

25:46.899 --> 25:48.993
And then all of a sudden,
I hear him say...

25:49.101 --> 25:54.005
I love the way
your foul little mind works.

25:54.106 --> 25:57.763
That's the next line of dialogue.
That's Jafar, the villain,

25:57.843 --> 25:59.812
to his evil sidekick, Iago.

25:59.912 --> 26:04.069
I love the way
your foul little mind works.

26:04.149 --> 26:05.515
And then I run down and grab Cornelia.

26:05.617 --> 26:07.347
I'm like, "He's memorized all the movies.

26:07.453 --> 26:09.607
"I mean, he's memorized them all.

26:09.687 --> 26:12.944
If you throw him a line of dialogue,
he'll throw you back the next line."

26:13.024 --> 26:17.081
And at that point,
it was like a window opened,

26:17.161 --> 26:20.495
like a light went on,

26:20.598 --> 26:25.332
and we began to speak to him
in Disney dialogue, the whole family.

26:30.808 --> 26:35.041
I memorized every Disney
animated movie ever made.

26:38.216 --> 26:42.176
I memorized the credits,
and that's how I taught myself to read.

26:42.286 --> 26:45.984
It felt like a great, wonderful...

26:47.291 --> 26:49.192
world of enchantment.

26:49.293 --> 26:51.387
When we'd be down in
the basement watching movies,

26:51.496 --> 26:53.317
when it would kind of
all come together where,

26:53.397 --> 26:56.390
you know, that's when we drew Owen out.

27:04.975 --> 27:07.843
And these were hand-drawn figures
with exaggerated expression,

27:10.380 --> 27:12.406
exaggerated emotion.

27:12.516 --> 27:15.577
It was easier for him
to interpret all of this.

27:18.221 --> 27:22.145
CORNELIA: I think the idea
that it never changes,

27:22.225 --> 27:25.315
and everything else
is changing constantly...

27:25.395 --> 27:27.057
every other part of his life.

27:27.164 --> 27:30.821
Our lives, as his parents,
we're getting older.

27:30.901 --> 27:33.928
You know, Walter's getting older.

27:34.037 --> 27:37.769
You know, people are dying.
Everything's changing,

27:37.874 --> 27:42.999
and that's the one thing that he can
hang onto that never changes.

27:43.079 --> 27:45.776
- What's Mommy doing?
- I'm making plans

27:45.882 --> 27:48.371
for our trip to Disney World in two days.

27:48.451 --> 27:51.541
Are we gonna want to go to
the Beauty and the Beast show?

27:51.621 --> 27:52.875
- Yeah.
- Is it too scary?

27:52.955 --> 27:54.877
- No.
- I think Mickey has a friend.

27:54.957 --> 27:58.450
There's Mickey, Goofy, Donald,
and blah, blah, blah.

28:00.462 --> 28:05.020
CORNELIA: He began to use different
movie scenes to express his feelings,

28:05.100 --> 28:07.467
like Hercules for not giving up,

28:07.570 --> 28:10.972
The Jungle Book for wanting friends,

28:11.073 --> 28:13.804
and Pinocchio for learning
what it feels like

28:13.909 --> 28:17.277
to be a real boy.

28:17.379 --> 28:20.213
RON: Cornelia and I are not therapists,
but we're kind of faking it here.

28:21.550 --> 28:24.884
And the goal was...
whatever works to get to Owen.

28:58.086 --> 29:01.576
These are

29:01.656 --> 29:03.989
for you.

29:04.092 --> 29:08.950
- Thank you, Owen.
- You're so welcome, Emily.

29:09.030 --> 29:10.752
I love you.

29:10.832 --> 29:12.494
"To Owen.

29:12.600 --> 29:17.868
"Thank you for always being there for me

29:17.972 --> 29:23.001
"in the happy times
and in the sad times too.

29:23.111 --> 29:26.634
I love you more than anything."

29:26.714 --> 29:31.880
And I also have this necklace for you too.

29:31.986 --> 29:34.717
Thanks, Emily.

29:34.822 --> 29:38.145
And... And I made it myself.

29:38.225 --> 29:41.195
Wow, what a wonderful thing.

29:41.295 --> 29:45.960
- OWEN: It's Mickey Mouse on it.
- Yeah. Yeah.

29:50.304 --> 29:53.794
Emily is wonderful and cute and adorable

29:53.874 --> 29:56.708
and sweet, soft, and gentle.

29:59.079 --> 30:00.801
When I move into my apartment,

30:00.881 --> 30:03.170
Emily will move
into the apartment above me,

30:03.250 --> 30:05.772
and we'll be neighbors in love.

30:05.852 --> 30:09.152
Another day, another day.

30:10.490 --> 30:11.812
Hi, how are you?

30:11.892 --> 30:13.146
- Hi.
- Good.

30:13.226 --> 30:14.648
Good to see you again this morning.

30:14.728 --> 30:16.650
- Good to see you again.
- Hey, Owen, good to see you again.

30:16.730 --> 30:19.519
- Come on back.
- Okay.

30:19.599 --> 30:22.522
Owen, here's one of the things
that gets hard for you.

30:22.602 --> 30:24.491
Not easy for you to talk to people.

30:24.571 --> 30:29.528
So we are going to just
say things about our lives

30:29.608 --> 30:31.364
we don't think someone else knows.

30:31.444 --> 30:35.006
Okay, so I'm gonna make a comment,
and my comment is,

30:36.048 --> 30:40.611
my 27-year-old daughter
rescued a kitten recently.

30:40.720 --> 30:44.543
My girlfriend Emily, she has a pet cat.

30:44.623 --> 30:48.347
I didn't know that. That's perfect.
Put that on there.

30:48.427 --> 30:50.683
That's great. And we're not
working on questions right now,

30:50.763 --> 30:52.288
so I'm not gonna ask you
any questions about it,

30:52.398 --> 30:54.924
but that was the perfect comment
to follow that up.

30:55.034 --> 30:57.094
- Yeah.
- I grew up with cats.

30:57.203 --> 30:58.967
I thought I only liked cats.

30:59.071 --> 31:03.863
I never liked dogs,
and it turns out I love dogs.

31:03.943 --> 31:09.314
- I love our dog, Gus.
- That was a perfect comment.

31:11.250 --> 31:16.655
Owen, given his autism,
he really likes things scripted.

31:16.756 --> 31:20.880
In fact, things that are unpredictable
make our folks really anxious,

31:20.960 --> 31:22.213
so they really like the script.

31:22.293 --> 31:24.319
So can we pull out your phone,

31:24.429 --> 31:26.955
and you show me
your text history with Emily?

31:27.065 --> 31:28.829
Yeah, my girlfriend and sweetheart.

31:28.933 --> 31:33.337
You kind of get in a routine of telling
her that you really care about her.

31:33.438 --> 31:35.226
- Yeah.
- But you don't really

31:35.306 --> 31:39.641
- give her anything to think about.
- Well, but I want to.

31:39.744 --> 31:41.838
- So could we work on that?
- Yeah.

31:41.946 --> 31:46.008
But Owen, he's just filled
with the desire to relate,

31:46.117 --> 31:48.907
and he's born to a brain
that makes it hard.

31:48.987 --> 31:51.855
That does look...

31:51.956 --> 31:53.578
This is for putting your thoughts on,

31:53.658 --> 31:56.150
'cause I'm pushing your brain
to do some stuff that's hard.

31:56.261 --> 32:01.419
At his age, he wants to have
a job. He wants to grow up.

32:01.499 --> 32:03.195
And he tries to make sense of the world

32:03.301 --> 32:07.204
by fitting it into a Disney script, right,

32:07.305 --> 32:09.035
whereas we grow up, we try to go,

32:09.140 --> 32:11.129
"Okay, we just can make sense
of the world on our own."

32:11.209 --> 32:13.797
So for Owen, I think
it keeps things neat and tidy

32:13.877 --> 32:17.006
and fits into the black
and whiteness of the Disney.

32:17.114 --> 32:20.304
But the real world is not a Disney script.

32:20.384 --> 32:22.773
I kinda have a lot going on.

32:22.853 --> 32:24.942
Yeah. Is it also about how you feel

32:25.022 --> 32:28.812
in terms of moving
and all the changes going on?

32:28.892 --> 32:31.148
- For sure.
- So does that also kind of feel...

32:31.228 --> 32:32.950
Does it feel scary?

32:33.030 --> 32:34.999
- A little bit.
- Yeah.

32:39.203 --> 32:43.038
I think it's easy,
when a kid has had so much therapy,

32:43.140 --> 32:47.498
and is 23, to think that the trunk

32:47.578 --> 32:50.000
is a lot stronger than it is, you know?

32:50.080 --> 32:51.708
And the roots are stronger than the are.

32:51.815 --> 32:52.836
Yeah.

32:52.916 --> 32:57.581
But when I see him working with you and
really on these very basic conceptual...

32:57.688 --> 33:02.092
ability for conceptual thinking,
it makes it very clear how...

33:02.192 --> 33:04.684
how great the deficits were.

33:06.229 --> 33:10.064
You know, 23-year-olds
are off graduating from college.

33:10.166 --> 33:12.567
You know, moving
around the world independently.

33:12.668 --> 33:14.824
- Right.
- No one expects that

33:14.904 --> 33:17.931
of Owen at this point, but the question
is, what can we expect for him?

33:18.040 --> 33:19.406
- Right, right.
- What do you think

33:19.509 --> 33:23.533
Owen's contributions are
to his community, to his family?

33:23.613 --> 33:26.369
We asked ourselves that for so many years,

33:26.449 --> 33:29.038
and at one point,
Ron just looked at me and said,

33:29.118 --> 33:31.952
"So who decides
what a meaningful life is?"

33:54.977 --> 33:55.967
- Clap.
- Yay.

33:57.713 --> 34:01.570
This is my Disney friend

34:01.650 --> 34:04.643
- Jonathan Freeman.
- [APPLAUSE, CHEERING]

34:07.556 --> 34:11.045
- Yeah! Hi, Jonathan.
- Hi, how are you?

34:11.126 --> 34:12.788
How's it going, my friend?

34:12.893 --> 34:15.659
- How are you?
- Good.

34:15.764 --> 34:17.752
OWEN: Jonathan Freeman is a great actor

34:17.831 --> 34:20.889
who also does voices
for animated Disney films.

34:20.969 --> 34:24.632
Your father's charged me
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

34:24.739 --> 34:26.594
The boy was a criminal.

34:26.675 --> 34:30.098
He is the voice of the evil
Jafar in Disney's Aladdin

34:30.178 --> 34:33.101
and now my official buddy, pal,
and friend of the family.

34:33.181 --> 34:37.516
So, Jonathan and I first
became pals and friends

34:37.619 --> 34:42.244
for my 19th birthday weekend
when me and my mom and dad

34:42.324 --> 34:45.987
went to New York to see Disney's
Mary Poppins on Broadway.

34:46.094 --> 34:49.117
- I saw that!
- And he was the Admiral,

34:49.197 --> 34:52.826
and my dad wrote him a note
and sent it to him,

34:52.933 --> 34:55.697
and he called me up on my birthday,

34:55.803 --> 34:59.137
and Jonathan
is a great friend of mine now.

35:02.710 --> 35:04.632
- So what are we gonna do?
- We're gonna...

35:04.712 --> 35:06.967
We're gonna do
several scenes from Aladdin.

35:07.047 --> 35:09.516
- We're gonna do a few scenes, yeah.
- Okay!

35:09.617 --> 35:12.273
- Yeah.
- Sands of time,

35:12.353 --> 35:15.776
reveal to me the one
who can enter the cave.

35:15.856 --> 35:19.156
That's him! That's the clown
we've been waiting for.

35:22.496 --> 35:23.896
- You're Iago.
- Yeah.

35:23.998 --> 35:27.196
- And I'm Jafar. You ready?
- Ready.

35:27.301 --> 35:28.822
- Okay.
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

35:28.902 --> 35:32.960
Jafar, what if you were the chump husband?

35:33.040 --> 35:34.872
- What?
- Okay, okay.

35:34.975 --> 35:38.165
You marry the princess. All right?

35:38.245 --> 35:41.669
Then... Then you become the sultan.

35:41.749 --> 35:46.413
Oh, marry the princess.
The idea has merit.

35:46.519 --> 35:51.344
- Yes, merit.
- Gilbert Gottfried!

35:51.424 --> 35:56.226
I don't believe it!

35:56.329 --> 36:00.653
Gilbert Gottfried! I...

36:00.733 --> 36:05.569
I am so unbelievably surprised!

36:05.672 --> 36:09.162
[LAUGHING]

36:09.242 --> 36:13.111
One... All right. I can't believe it!

36:13.212 --> 36:15.613
I just don't believe it!

36:15.715 --> 36:21.211
We're never gonna get a hold
of that stupid lamp!

36:25.858 --> 36:29.625
I hope you weren't doing
the lines better than I do.

36:31.030 --> 36:33.019
- It's okay.
- Yeah, good.

36:33.099 --> 36:37.189
That... That's all I need:
him doing the lines better

36:37.269 --> 36:40.859
- and working cheaper than I do.
- [LAUGHTER]

36:40.939 --> 36:43.895
- I don't think I've met you before.
- It's me, Owen.

36:43.975 --> 36:48.913
Yeah, yeah, you don't look
familiar to me. Get off the line.

36:51.650 --> 36:53.551
So...

37:09.301 --> 37:11.497
RON: Owen went to his first school.

37:12.738 --> 37:15.927
We end up getting him into
the Lab School of Washington,

37:16.007 --> 37:18.063
which is expensive.

37:18.143 --> 37:21.099
At this point, my career
as a journalist is taking off.

37:21.179 --> 37:25.237
Sending Owen to this school
is something we can do.

37:25.317 --> 37:27.808
Many of the kids there
are learning disabled,

37:27.918 --> 37:33.152
which is things like dyslexia, maybe
ADHD, stuff that's more manageable.

37:33.257 --> 37:35.780
They definitely accept him
with the caveat that,

37:35.860 --> 37:38.449
you know, we're gonna
really have to make sure

37:38.529 --> 37:42.022
that this continues to be
the right place for him.

37:42.133 --> 37:45.592
So from day one, it was a struggle.

37:47.338 --> 37:49.794
His speech was still very limited,

37:49.874 --> 37:55.040
and his social skills
were even more limited.

37:55.146 --> 37:59.637
After another year or two, it's clear
the other kids are moving forward,

37:59.717 --> 38:02.640
but he is not

38:02.720 --> 38:05.643
making enough progress,
the school tells us.

38:05.723 --> 38:09.647
Basically, he's not running fast enough,

38:09.727 --> 38:14.495
and the school says, "Sorry, you're out.
This isn't gonna work."

38:18.702 --> 38:20.795
CORNELIA: It was really hard on him.

38:22.338 --> 38:26.796
He was really falling back,
regressing in a big way.

38:26.876 --> 38:28.868
It was a glop.

38:28.978 --> 38:32.302
A glop is down years,

38:32.382 --> 38:34.681
rough down years.

38:41.858 --> 38:44.481
When I was in the glop, I started to think

38:44.561 --> 38:47.258
my best years were behind me.

38:47.363 --> 38:51.994
I wasn't into any animated films
that time.

38:55.772 --> 38:58.071
CORNELIA: After I homeschooled
Owen for a year,

38:58.174 --> 39:02.373
we got him accepted to a high school
for special needs kids.

39:04.514 --> 39:09.539
RON: But something happens.

39:09.619 --> 39:12.110
CORNELIA: Owen really became very
withdrawn, even more,

39:12.221 --> 39:13.375
and he was very sad,

39:13.455 --> 39:15.878
and it was really a tough time.

39:15.958 --> 39:18.291
He is so high-strung,
he barely can breathe.

39:18.393 --> 39:21.683
When I would go to pick him up
in the carpool, like,

39:21.763 --> 39:23.519
he would dart out so fast into the car.

39:23.599 --> 39:25.431
I'd be like, "Owen, are you okay?"

39:25.534 --> 39:29.437
"Yeah, yeah.
Let's go, let's go, let's go."

39:29.538 --> 39:31.632
Ron sat him down one day and said,

39:31.740 --> 39:35.268
"Owen, is everything okay?
What's going on?"

39:35.377 --> 39:37.366
And he said,

39:37.446 --> 39:42.704
"There are boys at school
that are bullying me."

39:42.784 --> 39:45.720
The bullies said they were gonna burn
my house down and hunt me down.

39:48.257 --> 39:52.319
These kids basically just tormented him,

39:52.427 --> 39:56.455
and because he's so literal,
he literally thought

39:56.565 --> 39:58.796
that our house was gonna be burned down,

39:58.901 --> 40:00.923
and his parents were gonna be killed.

40:01.003 --> 40:05.633
In that moment, I fell into darkness
and walked the halls of fear.

40:30.698 --> 40:32.753
WALTER: Well, I was just enraged about it.

40:32.833 --> 40:35.089
Like, it was like I failed to protect him.

40:35.169 --> 40:39.794
You know, I would've rounded
up a posse and, you know,

40:39.874 --> 40:45.040
kicked the shit out of them, but I didn't,

40:45.146 --> 40:46.601
and I think that's
why I still think about it.

40:46.681 --> 40:49.708
I'm still bitter about it
'cause I was, like...

40:49.817 --> 40:53.154
was, like, right there when I
could've been there for Owen.

40:56.523 --> 41:02.053
Quasimodo! Quasimodo! Quasimodo!

41:02.162 --> 41:04.461
You think he's ugly now? Watch this.

41:11.972 --> 41:13.736
Hail to the king!

41:57.950 --> 42:01.040
RON: After the bullying,
in the weeks that follow,

42:01.120 --> 42:03.612
Owen goes down to the basement.

42:03.722 --> 42:07.046
It's odd. He seems like he's working
on something downstairs.

42:07.126 --> 42:11.517
I go down, and I see he's been drawing,

42:11.597 --> 42:14.795
and then I sit down with the book,
and I start flipping pages.

42:16.035 --> 42:17.936
A hundred pages of pictures.

42:18.037 --> 42:22.532
And every character is a sidekick.

42:23.909 --> 42:26.970
There are no heroes.
They're all sidekicks.

42:27.079 --> 42:28.638
There are hundreds of them in Disney.

42:29.548 --> 42:32.450
Some are goofy. Some are resourceful.
Some are wise.

42:33.485 --> 42:38.617
Merlin, Rafiki, Jiminy Cricket...
They're all sidekicks.

42:39.458 --> 42:43.451
At that point, I didn't feel like
a hero. I felt like a sidekick.

42:45.229 --> 42:48.631
The sidekicks are fun-loving,
comical, wacky, playful,

42:48.733 --> 42:51.134
friendly, and delightful,

42:51.235 --> 42:53.591
and they help the hero
fulfill their destiny,

42:53.671 --> 42:56.641
and they support the heroes.

42:56.741 --> 42:59.931
On the last two pages, in his scrawl,

43:00.011 --> 43:04.415
"I am the protector of the sidekicks,"

43:05.583 --> 43:09.941
and the last thing he writes,
on the last page is,

43:10.021 --> 43:14.482
"No sidekick gets left behind."

43:19.864 --> 43:23.960
I created a story about sidekicks
searching for a hero in my head,

43:25.536 --> 43:28.267
and I called it "The Land
of the Lost Sidekicks."

43:30.775 --> 43:33.039
CORNELIA: The thing he did
that I think was interesting

43:33.143 --> 43:37.300
is that sort of using
the narrative of his own life

43:37.380 --> 43:38.871
to create these stories.

43:44.688 --> 43:48.612
But the sidekicks were there
to support him and...

43:48.692 --> 43:52.115
and help him find his way.

43:52.195 --> 43:55.996
He was really writing
little autobiographies.

43:59.836 --> 44:04.672
"The Land of the Lost Sidekicks,"
by Owen Suskind.

44:08.745 --> 44:12.580
There is a boy
who is just like other boys.

44:13.750 --> 44:15.505
Until one night,

44:15.585 --> 44:19.579
he sees from his window
a storm on the horizon.

44:22.859 --> 44:27.228
He is small, just three years old,
and scared.

45:48.610 --> 45:51.011
Owen, Owen.

46:57.577 --> 46:59.409
Bingo.

47:15.494 --> 47:18.658
- Nice to be out on the water again?
- It is.

47:21.667 --> 47:25.035
- Can I stay really close to the boat?
- Of course.

47:27.173 --> 47:30.871
I'm in. I'm in.

47:32.678 --> 47:34.943
- Okay, swim to me.
- And then I'll get out.

47:35.047 --> 47:37.881
- You've got to do breaststroke.
- No, I can do whatever.

47:39.919 --> 47:42.541
I swam to you, I swam to you.

47:42.621 --> 47:45.177
Okay. Hey, let me shake.

47:45.257 --> 47:46.418
- Thanks.
- Have you conquered your fears?

47:46.525 --> 47:49.689
- I did. Now I can get out.
- Okay.

47:58.203 --> 48:03.938
Happy birthday, dear Walter

48:04.042 --> 48:09.106
Happy birthday to you

48:09.214 --> 48:13.151
- Owen, bring it in. One...
- Two, three!

48:16.254 --> 48:18.543
CORNELIA: Okay, who would like ice cream?

48:18.623 --> 48:21.457
All right, there you go, my friend.

48:22.327 --> 48:25.050
What do you think about
Walter turning 26, Owe?

48:25.130 --> 48:28.753
It's gonna... It's odd but great.

48:28.833 --> 48:30.734
Odd? How is it odd?

48:33.071 --> 48:35.006
'Cause he and I are young men now.

48:35.106 --> 48:40.340
- How do you feel about being that?
- Still great, but a little...

48:43.782 --> 48:45.477
Different.

48:47.484 --> 48:50.774
'Cause I'm 23 now.

48:50.854 --> 48:54.848
So what was it like for you, Walt,
when you went from living in a dorm

48:54.958 --> 48:58.486
and being in college to living
on your own in an apartment?

48:58.595 --> 49:00.951
I thought living alone was... was great.

49:01.031 --> 49:03.454
It was a new, you know,
a new breath of freedom.

49:03.534 --> 49:06.595
I could, you know, do what I wanted,
when I wanted,

49:07.771 --> 49:10.294
like Owen... Owie, you can now.

49:10.374 --> 49:12.629
You're gonna do what
you want when you want.

49:12.709 --> 49:15.338
- Yeah.
- You're absolutely right, Walt.

49:17.147 --> 49:19.514
So where are you off to?

49:19.616 --> 49:23.986
- Well, he gave the coconut cake a try.
- I did. I tried.

49:31.695 --> 49:33.960
WALTER: My mom and dad are
getting older every year.

49:37.133 --> 49:40.570
Twenty years from now, who knows? And...

49:42.472 --> 49:44.566
It'll be just...

49:47.810 --> 49:51.968
It'll be just me, and I'll be ready.

49:52.048 --> 49:54.303
I've been getting ready my whole life,

49:54.383 --> 49:59.014
but it can kind of be overwhelming
to think about the...

50:01.591 --> 50:06.359
the idea of taking care of them
and taking care of Owen, and...

50:08.331 --> 50:10.061
how that's gonna look.

50:12.668 --> 50:16.230
Yeah, it can keep you up at night,
thinking about it,

50:16.339 --> 50:21.778
and, for some reason, the birthday
is sometimes when it rips out of me.

50:22.845 --> 50:27.370
But... most of the time,

50:27.450 --> 50:30.005
I just forget about it
and try not to think about it

50:30.085 --> 50:32.554
because it'll come at some point.

50:34.222 --> 50:37.590
I'm his only family he's got,

50:37.692 --> 50:42.017
and I'll have to do

50:42.097 --> 50:43.351
whatever I have to do...

50:43.431 --> 50:45.024
I have to do to make sure he's okay.

50:56.878 --> 50:58.779
Owen, go up!

50:59.814 --> 51:01.305
Run up field, run.

51:01.416 --> 51:03.572
- Owen, go! Go, go, go.
- I'll get it, I'll get it,

51:03.652 --> 51:07.054
- I'll get it, I'll get it!
- Get it, get it.

51:08.990 --> 51:12.552
Owie, dribble up, dribble up. Dribble!

51:14.596 --> 51:16.051
That was a good try.

51:16.131 --> 51:17.886
When you see it,
you just stay with the ball.

51:17.966 --> 51:19.662
- Yes, I'll stay with the ball.
- Stay with the ball.

51:21.969 --> 51:23.995
Owen, dribble, bud! Go!

51:34.081 --> 51:36.676
- The champ!
- Thanks.

51:36.784 --> 51:40.016
- I'm proud of you, buddy.
- I did great.

51:50.464 --> 51:55.589
Well, it's like I always say,
Your Majesty.

51:55.669 --> 52:00.437
Children got to be free
to lead their own lives.

52:16.389 --> 52:20.113
I just can't believe
how far Owen has come.

52:20.193 --> 52:23.316
Look at how much distance he's traveled.

52:23.396 --> 52:26.560
Look at how much progress
he made from there to there.

52:26.666 --> 52:31.832
It doesn't seem that long ago that we
thought he would never talk again.

52:33.673 --> 52:38.407
Owen Harry Suskind
from Cambridge, Massachusetts.

52:43.816 --> 52:47.006
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Yay, I did it!

52:47.086 --> 52:49.142
Yay, I did it!

52:49.222 --> 52:51.020
Mom.

52:53.192 --> 52:55.821
- Mom.
- I'm so proud of you.

52:57.263 --> 52:59.391
- Hey, buddy.
- Dad.

52:59.499 --> 53:02.435
We're so proud of you.
You're the greatest.

53:02.535 --> 53:05.902
- I am the greatest.
- You are the greatest.

53:07.072 --> 53:09.940
- Hi, Walter.
- I love you.

53:28.293 --> 53:30.262
Hey, buddy, we got to...
we got to pack up.

53:30.362 --> 53:34.853
Oh, can we watch three scenes
of Dumbo to celebrate?

53:34.933 --> 53:37.926
- To celebrate what?
- The packing day.

53:39.271 --> 53:43.470
Well, what... Hold on. What scenes
are you thinking of? I'm lost here.

53:43.575 --> 53:47.205
I think the packing scenes...

53:48.880 --> 53:51.975
- Dumbo.
- Dumbo. Let it rip.

53:52.084 --> 53:54.373
And then packing.

53:54.453 --> 53:56.422
Come on, Dumbo.

54:00.925 --> 54:03.080
When you were little,
you'd watch this movie.

54:03.160 --> 54:04.248
Yeah.

54:04.328 --> 54:06.126
When you were facing some pretty tough...

54:06.230 --> 54:08.586
tough challenges.

54:08.666 --> 54:13.591
How did it make you feel
when you got to the end?

54:13.671 --> 54:16.505
- So happy.
- Yeah.

54:29.987 --> 54:33.185
- RON: It can go right on top.
- OWEN: One more big box.

54:34.258 --> 54:37.820
- Where's your thing?
- It's right... Oh, no!

54:37.928 --> 54:41.160
- When did you last see it?
- I don't remember!

54:41.265 --> 54:45.122
All right, Mickey Mouse charm. Now,
it's got to be on a path. His Mickey...

54:45.202 --> 54:46.590
- What happened?
- The Mickey Mouse charm

54:46.670 --> 54:48.263
- that Emily gave him fell off.
- Yeah?

54:49.140 --> 54:53.096
Where is it? Oh, where is it?
I hope no one stepped on it.

54:53.176 --> 54:56.044
Look around, look around, look around,
look around. Should I sniff it?

54:56.146 --> 55:00.603
- Owen, can you smell it?
- No, I can't.

55:00.683 --> 55:02.015
- It's somewhere, right?
- Yeah.

55:02.118 --> 55:04.107
And if it's not somewhere,
you're gonna get one,

55:04.187 --> 55:06.142
and in a few days,
it'll be exactly the same.

55:06.222 --> 55:08.851
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I mean, Emily...

55:08.958 --> 55:12.053
- Emily made it for me.
- She didn't make the Mickey emblem.

55:12.162 --> 55:14.358
- She bought it.
- Bought it?

55:14.464 --> 55:18.288
Did she make the Mickey emblem?
Did she go to a metal shop and make it?

55:18.368 --> 55:20.623
No, of course not.

55:20.703 --> 55:25.232
- Any shiny item could be Mickey.
- Shiny item.

55:27.310 --> 55:29.905
Owen, could you come here, please?

55:30.013 --> 55:33.002
- What?
- I have to give you something.

55:33.082 --> 55:35.881
What? What?

55:35.985 --> 55:40.081
- You found it. Where was it?
- On the ground.

55:40.190 --> 55:41.590
Yay.

55:41.691 --> 55:43.846
There's no way
Mickey's coming off of there.

55:43.926 --> 55:45.224
- Yay.
- Okay?

55:45.327 --> 55:48.984
Perfect. Yay.

55:49.064 --> 55:50.760
All set.

56:15.090 --> 56:17.389
There it is. Exciting!

56:18.794 --> 56:20.592
- Wow.
- Here we are, Owen.

56:20.696 --> 56:23.393
Yes, here we are.

56:25.300 --> 56:27.222
So exciting.

56:27.302 --> 56:30.101
What do we got here? What do we got here?

56:30.205 --> 56:32.227
Me, Emily, and John and Julie.

56:32.307 --> 56:34.276
Owen Suskind.

56:34.375 --> 56:35.696
- Number...
- Apartment...

56:35.776 --> 56:37.698
Number one.

56:37.778 --> 56:39.700
- Wow.
- Do you know what?

56:39.780 --> 56:42.306
- I think you should open the door.
- No, no.

56:43.885 --> 56:45.206
There we go.

56:45.286 --> 56:47.778
Oh, boy. Owen!

56:47.889 --> 56:50.578
- Here it is.
- Here it is. Yay!

56:50.658 --> 56:53.080
- Your own apartment.
- Yay!

56:53.160 --> 56:56.584
- Your own condo.
- My own condo, yay!

56:56.664 --> 56:58.586
- What do you think, huh?
- So cool.

56:58.666 --> 57:03.090
Owen, this closet is bigger than Mom
and my first apartment in New York.

57:03.170 --> 57:07.835
- Yeah. What could be in here?
- Cool!

57:07.942 --> 57:10.138
- Videos, that's amazing.
- Who would've imagined?

57:10.244 --> 57:12.934
Who would imagine?

57:13.014 --> 57:14.983
Excuse me, coming through.

57:43.310 --> 57:44.835
- Are you good?
- I'm good.

57:44.945 --> 57:46.880
- It's a big night for you.
- It was.

57:48.882 --> 57:52.182
It will be. Owen.

57:52.285 --> 57:53.773
- Thanks.
- Owen?

57:53.853 --> 57:55.308
- Yeah?
- Where are you right now?

57:55.388 --> 57:58.358
I'm right... I'm home, my new home.

57:59.726 --> 58:00.887
Good-bye, Mom.

58:00.994 --> 58:03.116
- Good-bye, I love you.
- Love you too.

58:03.196 --> 58:04.317
I'll see you and Dad tomorrow.

58:04.397 --> 58:05.888
This is so exciting. Have a great night.

58:05.999 --> 58:07.865
- I love you, buddy.
- I love you, too, Dad.

58:07.968 --> 58:10.369
Okay, off we go.

58:26.385 --> 58:29.981
I'm missing my... I gotta find my pills.

59:01.186 --> 59:07.012
You must never rush out on the
meadow. There might be danger.

59:07.092 --> 59:12.689
Out there, we are unprotected,
so we have to be very careful.

59:13.765 --> 59:17.099
Bambi, quick! The thicket!

59:22.473 --> 59:23.463
Faster.

59:28.046 --> 59:29.605
Mother!

59:33.651 --> 59:35.779
Mother!

59:41.793 --> 59:44.558
Mother, where are you?

59:49.133 --> 59:51.125
Mother?

59:56.107 --> 59:57.598
Mother?

01:00:24.167 --> 01:00:27.365
I never lived by myself before.

01:00:29.473 --> 01:00:31.499
Emily will move in next week.

01:00:33.110 --> 01:00:34.464
One over this flame here.

01:00:34.544 --> 01:00:36.479
There are people here to help me.

01:00:37.114 --> 01:00:40.303
I get help cooking.

01:00:40.383 --> 01:00:43.785
They help me with medication
and paying bills.

01:00:45.055 --> 01:00:47.854
We all go on fun outings.

01:00:49.826 --> 01:00:51.351
They can help me look for a job,

01:00:51.461 --> 01:00:55.284
which is something I really want to do.

01:00:55.364 --> 01:00:58.823
Independent means... great and fabulous.

01:01:21.724 --> 01:01:24.387
Is this the right mailbox?

01:01:26.529 --> 01:01:30.728
Excuse me. Is this the right mailbox?

01:01:34.170 --> 01:01:36.071
- Okay, can I see which one you have?
- Which one's mine?

01:01:36.172 --> 01:01:38.403
- Yeah.
- I don't...

01:01:39.775 --> 01:01:42.031
I'm not sure if that's a mailbox key.

01:01:42.111 --> 01:01:44.166
- So...
- Let's go check back.

01:01:44.246 --> 01:01:46.909
- It had the number on it, so...
- It says here, two.

01:01:47.016 --> 01:01:48.381
Yeah, let's go check back.

01:01:52.921 --> 01:01:54.617
Let's see.

01:01:56.424 --> 01:01:59.883
- Yes, you've got mail!
- Yes, I got mail. Let's see.

01:02:01.229 --> 01:02:03.384
Let's see. Got mail.

01:02:03.464 --> 01:02:05.456
- Yeah, all right.
- Let's bring it back.

01:02:05.567 --> 01:02:08.570
- Mission accomplished.
- Mission accomplished.

01:02:15.476 --> 01:02:17.031
- Hi, Emily.
- Hi, Owen.

01:02:17.111 --> 01:02:19.307
Hi, Emily. How are you doing?

01:02:19.414 --> 01:02:22.976
- I'm doing good. How are you doing?
- I'm doing great.

01:02:28.156 --> 01:02:29.911
I'm glad you made it.

01:02:29.991 --> 01:02:35.328
- Which one should we do?
- I guess...

01:02:35.430 --> 01:02:37.719
How about make the cookies
and then watch a movie?

01:02:37.799 --> 01:02:40.063
- That sounds like a great idea.
- Yeah.

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:51.771
- Thanks, Emily.
- You're welcome.

01:02:54.915 --> 01:02:59.573
I hope we baked them right.

01:02:59.653 --> 01:03:03.610
- Did we bake them right?
- Oh, no. I don't want to...

01:03:03.690 --> 01:03:07.786
- That's okay.
- Oh, thanks, Emily.

01:03:09.096 --> 01:03:11.190
At least we gave it a try.

01:03:11.298 --> 01:03:12.698
- Yeah.
- We did good.

01:03:12.799 --> 01:03:14.529
We did great.

01:03:20.507 --> 01:03:25.036
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay. Oh, ouch.

01:03:25.145 --> 01:03:27.046
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:03:27.147 --> 01:03:28.877
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:03:28.982 --> 01:03:31.438
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:03:31.518 --> 01:03:34.954
You need me to kiss it better?

01:03:36.155 --> 01:03:37.646
I think it's good.

01:04:00.079 --> 01:04:01.877
- Owie.
- Yeah?

01:04:01.981 --> 01:04:05.713
- Not going well here.
- Not going well 'cause of the rocks.

01:04:05.818 --> 01:04:08.049
Yeah, I was just thinking. You and Emily

01:04:08.154 --> 01:04:10.555
are the same age Mom and Dad
were when they...

01:04:10.656 --> 01:04:12.056
- Yeah.
- Started dating.

01:04:12.158 --> 01:04:13.592
Yeah.

01:04:13.693 --> 01:04:15.559
You kind of see yourselves
like Mom and Dad?

01:04:15.661 --> 01:04:17.650
- Yes, we do.
- How so?

01:04:17.730 --> 01:04:20.686
'Cause we take it slowly.

01:04:20.766 --> 01:04:24.896
- Yeah?
- Yeah. We have the same interests.

01:04:25.003 --> 01:04:26.494
Yeah? So what are...

01:04:28.073 --> 01:04:30.599
- You got Disney.
- Yeah.

01:04:30.709 --> 01:04:33.736
Pretty serious thing,
a girlfriend of three years, you know.

01:04:33.845 --> 01:04:38.003
Yeah, it is pretty serious.

01:04:38.083 --> 01:04:40.372
You've had a class
on this at school, right?

01:04:40.452 --> 01:04:42.340
Have you thought about those things?

01:04:42.420 --> 01:04:44.376
Sometimes I have.

01:04:44.456 --> 01:04:46.344
How does it make you feel?

01:04:46.424 --> 01:04:51.850
It makes me feel a little
nervous and a little excited.

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:54.764
Okay, how does it make you
feel a little nervous?

01:04:54.866 --> 01:04:57.889
- Let's start with that.
- I haven't tried it before.

01:04:57.969 --> 01:05:00.404
Have you seen it?

01:05:01.439 --> 01:05:03.465
- Yeah.
- Yeah? Where'd you see it?

01:05:03.875 --> 01:05:05.707
- Movies.
- Yeah?

01:05:06.711 --> 01:05:09.701
For instance, you see
how some people kiss.

01:05:09.781 --> 01:05:14.372
- Yeah.
- They might use their what?

01:05:14.452 --> 01:05:17.207
They don't just use their lips.
They use their...

01:05:17.287 --> 01:05:21.418
- Their feelings.
- All right.

01:05:22.393 --> 01:05:24.828
- Ice cream time, bud?
- Yes, let's go!

01:05:28.298 --> 01:05:31.632
WALTER: For Owen, unknown
things make him uncomfortable,

01:05:31.735 --> 01:05:36.593
whether it's an unknown place or
someone he doesn't know, or sex.

01:05:36.673 --> 01:05:38.595
It's been a little tricky to navigate

01:05:38.675 --> 01:05:43.409
because Owen's basis for pretty
much everything is Disney,

01:05:44.314 --> 01:05:49.480
and Disney, beyond the, like,
kind of final kiss in every movie...

01:05:49.586 --> 01:05:53.819
the, you know, straight kiss, no tongue...

01:05:53.924 --> 01:05:57.247
it doesn't really delve into relationships

01:05:57.327 --> 01:06:00.161
and sex really that much.

01:06:00.264 --> 01:06:04.360
I've tried a number of tactics
that work to varied degrees.

01:06:04.468 --> 01:06:07.700
Bringing up the idea of a French kiss,
I found out just didn't work.

01:06:08.671 --> 01:06:10.333
You know, he's a red-blooded American man.

01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.629
He's got his same biological
needs as everyone else,

01:06:13.709 --> 01:06:18.968
but in terms of, like,
full-on sex, I have...

01:06:19.048 --> 01:06:23.679
I mean, I have no idea how to really
get to that point, short of...

01:06:25.488 --> 01:06:29.550
I don't know.
Showing him Disney porn, maybe?

01:06:29.659 --> 01:06:32.949
I really don't know.

01:06:33.029 --> 01:06:35.318
Owen, you know your
favorite Little Mermaid songs?

01:06:35.398 --> 01:06:38.821
- Yeah, "Kiss the Girl."
- What do I mean by that?

01:06:38.901 --> 01:06:43.896
- Just kiss her, using my tongue.
- Okay.

01:06:44.006 --> 01:06:45.907
I will do it.

01:06:54.417 --> 01:06:56.506
- How you doing?
- I'm doing good. I'm Owen.

01:06:56.586 --> 01:06:58.674
Nice to meet you.
My name is Jeffrey Ortiz.

01:06:58.754 --> 01:07:01.882
- Hi, Jeffrey.
- You can have a seat right here.

01:07:02.824 --> 01:07:06.226
All right, so why are you interested
in working for us here?

01:07:06.328 --> 01:07:09.484
'Cause I love going to movie theaters
and cinemas all the time.

01:07:09.564 --> 01:07:11.055
And do you come here pretty often?

01:07:11.166 --> 01:07:12.395
- Yes, I do.
- Yeah? Very good.

01:07:13.735 --> 01:07:15.657
How many hours were you looking to work?

01:07:15.737 --> 01:07:16.898
- Twenty.
- Okay.

01:07:17.873 --> 01:07:21.997
- So this is the concession area.
- Yeah.

01:07:22.077 --> 01:07:24.166
Do you do any cash handling?

01:07:24.246 --> 01:07:25.544
- No.
- No? Okay.

01:07:27.048 --> 01:07:28.036
I'll walk you out if you'd like.

01:07:28.116 --> 01:07:29.414
- Okay.
- All right.

01:07:31.386 --> 01:07:33.708
- Thanks for having me, Jeff.
- Oh, you're very welcome.

01:07:33.788 --> 01:07:35.677
When can I hear a response?

01:07:35.757 --> 01:07:37.212
As soon as we get your references back.

01:07:37.292 --> 01:07:39.124
It should be a pretty
quick turnaround after that.

01:07:39.227 --> 01:07:40.422
- Okay.
- All right?

01:07:40.529 --> 01:07:42.521
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

01:08:03.918 --> 01:08:06.240
I just got a call.

01:08:06.320 --> 01:08:10.724
Apparently Emily broke up with Owen.

01:08:12.059 --> 01:08:14.915
There was a meeting with
all the caseworkers today,

01:08:14.995 --> 01:08:17.464
so basically, the caseworkers told Owen

01:08:17.564 --> 01:08:19.658
that it was over with Emily in the room.

01:08:19.767 --> 01:08:22.089
It sounds bad.

01:08:22.169 --> 01:08:24.331
I'll give him a ca... Is he just... Yeah.

01:08:25.805 --> 01:08:28.002
RON: He needs a brother call right now.

01:08:28.108 --> 01:08:32.671
Emily gave these reasons, like, five
points about Owen being too close

01:08:32.779 --> 01:08:36.182
and needing space
and everything else, so...

01:08:38.018 --> 01:08:39.747
Goddamn it.

01:08:55.635 --> 01:08:59.834
I don't think it is.

01:08:59.939 --> 01:09:03.962
Why, Mufasa.

01:09:04.042 --> 01:09:06.035
Hi, Emily.

01:09:06.145 --> 01:09:08.478
Emily?

01:09:14.921 --> 01:09:18.220
- No.
- Good luck, Emily!

01:09:19.826 --> 01:09:22.115
Come on, guys. Come on, come on, come on.

01:09:22.194 --> 01:09:23.527
We've got to get in the van, okay?

01:09:25.298 --> 01:09:26.890
Hey, Emily.

01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:36.502
At least I waved to her.

01:09:43.649 --> 01:09:45.880
- CORDELIA: Hi, honey.
- Mom?

01:09:45.984 --> 01:09:49.841
- Yeah, sweetie?
- Why is life so full

01:09:49.921 --> 01:09:53.979
of unfair pain and tragedy?

01:09:54.059 --> 01:09:56.515
Owen, it's just the way life is.

01:09:56.595 --> 01:10:01.260
That's... That's the way life has
always been and will always be.

01:10:01.366 --> 01:10:04.189
We have incredibly joyous times...

01:10:04.269 --> 01:10:07.025
- Yeah!
- ...and relaxing times,

01:10:07.105 --> 01:10:10.362
but we also have sad times
and painful times.

01:10:10.442 --> 01:10:15.867
I can't... But it's... But it's not fair.

01:10:15.947 --> 01:10:20.783
I know, honey. It's... So much things
that happen in life aren't fair.

01:10:20.886 --> 01:10:23.041
So many things.

01:10:23.121 --> 01:10:27.713
What do we have to do? Just face the
truth and be sad forever?

01:10:27.793 --> 01:10:30.548
No, not forever at all.

01:10:30.628 --> 01:10:35.052
Just... You have to face the truth
and grit your teeth

01:10:35.132 --> 01:10:39.228
and... and know that things
are gonna get better.

01:11:19.744 --> 01:11:25.268
- Yeah. Yeah, hi, Mom.
- How are you, buddy?

01:11:25.348 --> 01:11:27.977
- I'm so glad to see you.
- I'm so glad to see you too.

01:11:32.589 --> 01:11:36.613
And I fear Emily will be this way forever.

01:11:36.693 --> 01:11:38.448
She won't, honey. She won't.

01:11:38.528 --> 01:11:42.021
Have you started a journal
about your feelings,

01:11:42.132 --> 01:11:43.998
that you can write things out
and you can write...

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:47.957
But I don't want to be alone and single.

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:51.030
Well, that's really not
a choice right now, huh?

01:11:51.141 --> 01:11:53.007
- It's not a choice.
- But it doesn't mean

01:11:53.109 --> 01:11:58.268
- you're gonna always be.
- But I don't want her to forget me.

01:11:58.348 --> 01:11:59.769
- Hey, Owen?
- Yeah?

01:11:59.849 --> 01:12:02.876
- Emily's fine.
- I don't want her to forget me.

01:12:02.986 --> 01:12:05.275
Do you know who I'm
a little bit concerned about?

01:12:05.355 --> 01:12:08.778
- Me.
- It's you. Most people at your age,

01:12:08.858 --> 01:12:12.315
they don't meet the love
of their life forever...

01:12:12.395 --> 01:12:14.056
- What?
- At your age.

01:12:16.732 --> 01:12:20.066
What's the saying?
"Boy loves girl, boy loses girl,

01:12:20.169 --> 01:12:24.960
boy love... gets girl back in the end."

01:12:25.040 --> 01:12:28.807
- Boy finds another girl.
- But I...

01:12:31.346 --> 01:12:35.374
- This is driving me crazy.
- Yeah.

01:12:35.484 --> 01:12:38.674
Why did this have to happen

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:41.747
to make my life sad forever?

01:13:09.784 --> 01:13:12.039
I created Fuzzbutch, who is a villain

01:13:12.119 --> 01:13:16.511
in the Land of the Lost Sidekicks.

01:13:16.591 --> 01:13:21.783
Fuzzbutch's evil powers are
to blow fog into people's head

01:13:21.863 --> 01:13:25.853
to make the world look
like a weird place to them

01:13:25.933 --> 01:13:28.459
and make them look sad.

01:13:38.279 --> 01:13:40.771
There is evil in the forest.

01:14:50.215 --> 01:14:53.515
- Owen, Owen!
- Owen, Owen.

01:14:53.619 --> 01:14:56.612
- Owen, Owen.
- Owen, Owen, Owen.

01:15:17.810 --> 01:15:19.965
- So, Mom...
- Owen, has Daddy talked to you

01:15:20.045 --> 01:15:23.174
- about going to France?
- France? When?

01:15:24.149 --> 01:15:27.608
- France.
- France.

01:15:27.720 --> 01:15:32.177
- You don't want to go?
- I love Paris, France.

01:15:32.257 --> 01:15:37.594
So there's a conference on autism
where they want you to speak.

01:15:37.696 --> 01:15:40.097
It's actually the very first time, Owie,

01:15:40.199 --> 01:15:42.895
that people have gotten
together to learn about

01:15:43.001 --> 01:15:46.691
how autistic people use their passions
to help them understand the world,

01:15:46.771 --> 01:15:49.160
just like you use Disney.

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.162
Yeah, does that sound good?

01:15:51.242 --> 01:15:55.441
- It sounds great.
- Good, yeah. It'd be fun.

01:15:55.546 --> 01:15:56.605
Yeah.

01:15:58.716 --> 01:16:00.776
You're gonna get to give
a speech in English

01:16:00.885 --> 01:16:04.413
to a delegation,
an international delegation.

01:16:04.522 --> 01:16:06.923
Most of them are French, but they're
from all over the world.

01:16:07.025 --> 01:16:08.346
- Yeah.
- Okay?

01:16:08.426 --> 01:16:13.626
They are gonna translate
your speech into French.

01:16:13.731 --> 01:16:16.599
So I'll speak in English,
but they'll translate into French.

01:16:16.701 --> 01:16:19.193
You should just speak in Lumiere's
accent the whole time.

01:16:20.805 --> 01:16:22.527
- Should I really speak in...
- What do you think?

01:16:22.607 --> 01:16:24.098
- English.
- English.

01:16:24.208 --> 01:16:26.864
What should I write?
You're not telling me?

01:16:26.944 --> 01:16:29.641
No, I can't tell you.
It's got to come from...

01:16:29.747 --> 01:16:31.682
- Myself.
- Right.

01:16:31.783 --> 01:16:35.739
The way people see

01:16:35.819 --> 01:16:40.621
autistic... autistic people...

01:16:41.725 --> 01:16:44.160
RON: Don't look at me.

01:16:44.261 --> 01:16:47.384
- This is challenging.
- Just write right to here.

01:16:47.464 --> 01:16:51.088
- Another ten sentences?
- All right? Come on.

01:16:51.168 --> 01:16:52.923
- Don't whine?
- Don't whine.

01:16:53.003 --> 01:16:54.995
A little kid whines.

01:16:55.105 --> 01:16:57.094
A little kid whines.
You're not a little kid anymore.

01:16:57.174 --> 01:17:00.576
I'm a young adult. What else?

01:17:02.145 --> 01:17:05.604
Think. Think hard.

01:17:16.693 --> 01:17:20.117
You could break into song at any moment.

01:17:20.197 --> 01:17:24.658
They can sing, they can dance
After all this is France

01:17:24.768 --> 01:17:29.535
Dinner here is never second best

01:17:29.638 --> 01:17:32.595
Come on and fold your napkin

01:17:32.675 --> 01:17:35.631
Take a glance and then you'll

01:17:35.711 --> 01:17:39.842
Be our guest, be our guest, be our guest

01:17:39.949 --> 01:17:42.471
Beef ragout, cheese soufflÃ©

01:17:42.551 --> 01:17:45.885
Pie and pudding en flambÃ©

01:17:45.988 --> 01:17:49.117
- Is this it?
- It looks like a town hall, yeah.

01:17:49.859 --> 01:17:52.648
- Owen.
- Owen, this is Marie.

01:17:52.728 --> 01:17:54.617
- Hey, Marie.
- She's running the conference.

01:17:54.697 --> 01:17:58.293
- Hi, Marie. Bonjour.
- Bonjour, Owen.

01:18:00.369 --> 01:18:02.491
I am very pleased to meet you, Owen.

01:18:02.571 --> 01:18:04.233
Thanks, Marie.

01:18:04.340 --> 01:18:05.865
- Are you fine?
- Yeah.

01:18:05.975 --> 01:18:08.240
- Owen, come. Come chat, say hi.
- Yes, I am.

01:18:08.344 --> 01:18:11.333
- I don't like the smoking.
- He doesn't like smoking.

01:18:11.413 --> 01:18:13.149
A lot of people smoke in France.

01:18:15.451 --> 01:18:18.046
Do you want to do it yourself? Didn't
Walter teach you how to do this?

01:18:18.154 --> 01:18:20.452
No. Can you help me?

01:18:20.555 --> 01:18:23.252
Okay, I'm not always gonna
be here to do your tie, you know.

01:18:23.358 --> 01:18:24.690
I know.

01:18:31.799 --> 01:18:36.965
I can't believe it.
I just don't believe it.

01:18:37.071 --> 01:18:40.064
- Owen, are you ready?
- Yeah?

01:18:40.175 --> 01:18:41.837
I'm ready.

01:18:44.746 --> 01:18:48.239
Okay, everybody, let's move it. Okay.

01:19:38.665 --> 01:19:42.898
Bonjour, mesdames et messieurs.

01:19:51.612 --> 01:19:56.676
[SPEAKING FRENCH] I am honored

01:19:56.783 --> 01:20:01.949
to be here with you.

01:20:06.092 --> 01:20:08.748
[SPEAKING ENGLISH]
My name is Owen Suskind,

01:20:08.828 --> 01:20:11.992
and I love animated films.

01:20:12.098 --> 01:20:16.001
My friend Connor loves superheroes.

01:20:16.102 --> 01:20:21.370
My friend Brian is an expert
on the history of all actors

01:20:21.474 --> 01:20:26.299
and comedians who are Jewish.
There's a lot of them.

01:20:26.379 --> 01:20:29.669
The way people see those with autism

01:20:29.749 --> 01:20:33.550
is that they don't want
to be around other people.

01:20:33.653 --> 01:20:36.213
That's wrong.

01:20:42.962 --> 01:20:48.060
The truth about autistic people is that
we want what everyone else wants,

01:20:48.167 --> 01:20:50.864
but we are sometimes misguided

01:20:50.970 --> 01:20:55.126
and don't know how to connect with others.

01:20:55.206 --> 01:20:58.797
I was bullied in high school.

01:20:58.877 --> 01:21:02.780
The future seemed so scary and uncertain.

01:21:02.881 --> 01:21:05.337
I didn't want to grow up.

01:21:05.417 --> 01:21:09.946
I just watched the world
go by from my bell tower,

01:21:10.055 --> 01:21:14.045
like the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

01:21:14.125 --> 01:21:18.850
The Hunchback doesn't end
the way some movies do.

01:21:18.930 --> 01:21:21.653
Quasimodo doesn't get the girl,

01:21:21.733 --> 01:21:26.691
but he gets happily welcomed into society

01:21:26.771 --> 01:21:29.861
after a long, hard journey.

01:21:29.941 --> 01:21:32.467
Then he's no longer an outcast.

01:21:32.577 --> 01:21:36.368
That's kind of what happened to me.

01:21:36.448 --> 01:21:38.781
Now, when I look in the mirror,

01:21:38.883 --> 01:21:42.574
I see a proud autistic man,

01:21:42.654 --> 01:21:46.211
strong and brave
and ready to meet a future

01:21:46.291 --> 01:21:49.913
that is bright and full of wonder.

01:21:49.993 --> 01:21:53.794
Merci beaucoup.

01:22:16.387 --> 01:22:19.983
Walter! Walt's here!

01:22:20.090 --> 01:22:23.614
- Walt's here. Walt.
- Owie!

01:22:23.694 --> 01:22:25.749
- Good to see you, buddy.
- Good to see you.

01:22:25.829 --> 01:22:28.252
This is your... I haven't seen your place
yet. Look at that library.

01:22:28.332 --> 01:22:29.857
Yeah, I still have a few more to collect.

01:22:29.967 --> 01:22:31.088
You have some more to collect?

01:22:31.168 --> 01:22:33.590
- A few more.
- What are the plans?

01:22:33.670 --> 01:22:37.261
Oh, how about you and I hang out together?

01:22:37.341 --> 01:22:42.131
I'll show you the text me and Dad wrote
to Emily this past weekend.

01:22:42.211 --> 01:22:43.338
Last weekend.

01:22:43.446 --> 01:22:44.767
- Okay.
- I'll tell you.

01:22:44.847 --> 01:22:46.102
All right, read it to me.

01:22:46.182 --> 01:22:49.175
"Dear Emily, I took off the necklace

01:22:49.285 --> 01:22:50.907
"you gave me and put it away.

01:22:50.987 --> 01:22:53.718
"I wanted you to be clear
about my feelings

01:22:53.823 --> 01:22:56.691
"that I have accepted
our relationship is over.

01:22:56.793 --> 01:22:59.649
"Lots of couples break up
and remain friends.

01:22:59.729 --> 01:23:02.418
"I want us to be one of them.

01:23:02.498 --> 01:23:06.902
"We know each other too well
to throw our friendship away,

01:23:07.003 --> 01:23:09.905
"so let's just be friends
and make lots of new friends.

01:23:10.006 --> 01:23:13.465
Either way, I'm sure I'll see you
around. Your friend, Owen."

01:23:14.644 --> 01:23:19.981
- What do you think?
- It's good, it's good.

01:23:47.375 --> 01:23:48.843
Morning, Emily.

01:23:50.245 --> 01:23:52.167
Morning, Owen.

01:23:52.247 --> 01:23:57.205
Morning, Emily. Morning, Emily.

01:23:57.285 --> 01:23:59.754
Good morning, Owen. Is that your bike?

01:23:59.855 --> 01:24:00.842
It's my bike.

01:24:00.922 --> 01:24:02.288
That's cool.

01:24:02.390 --> 01:24:03.414
It is.

01:24:03.525 --> 01:24:04.679
How'd you sleep last night?

01:24:04.759 --> 01:24:06.591
I slept good.
How did you sleep last night?

01:24:06.695 --> 01:24:07.754
I slept great.

01:24:07.863 --> 01:24:10.352
That's great. Glad to hear it.

01:24:10.432 --> 01:24:11.900
Yeah. I'll see...

01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:12.988
See you later.

01:24:13.068 --> 01:24:14.263
See you later.

01:24:29.383 --> 01:24:33.207
OWEN: After battling
the evil Lord Fuzzbutch,

01:24:33.287 --> 01:24:38.225
the boy finds himself at the bottom
of a deep, dark pit.

01:24:46.100 --> 01:24:50.435
He sees something glinting
in the darkness around him.

01:25:39.452 --> 01:25:41.648
- Thanks.
- There you go. Enjoy the show.

01:25:43.690 --> 01:25:46.057
- Thanks.
- Enjoy the show.

01:25:46.159 --> 01:25:49.527
- Okay.
- Enjoy the show!

01:25:52.365 --> 01:25:55.755
I've been scared my whole life
of growing up

01:25:55.835 --> 01:26:00.760
because you might lose some
of the old things you treasured,

01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:03.796
like all my fun films,

01:26:03.876 --> 01:26:06.175
but I never did.

01:26:07.847 --> 01:26:10.543
CORDELIA: We definitely worry
about getting old.

01:26:10.649 --> 01:26:13.972
My hope and dream,
when Ron and I aren't here,

01:26:14.052 --> 01:26:16.681
is that he is independent enough
to make it

01:26:16.788 --> 01:26:20.225
and be able to grow older on his own.

01:26:21.793 --> 01:26:24.116
RON: He's gonna have to fail.

01:26:24.196 --> 01:26:26.722
He's gonna have to fall and fail.

01:26:28.567 --> 01:26:32.197
You know, we're not afraid
of that as we used to be.

01:26:32.304 --> 01:26:35.240
I think he'll be okay.

01:26:40.746 --> 01:26:43.335
The future?

01:26:43.415 --> 01:26:47.506
I'm still searching for it.

01:26:47.586 --> 01:26:51.148
My childhood days were over.

01:26:52.758 --> 01:26:54.852
That doesn't matter.

01:27:15.179 --> 01:27:19.170
We're way beyond the boundary
of the Pride Lands.

01:27:19.250 --> 01:27:22.006
Hey, look, Banana Beak is scared.

01:27:22.086 --> 01:27:26.210
That's Mr. Banana Beak to you, Fuzzy,

01:27:26.290 --> 01:27:30.227
and right now we are all
in very real danger.
