WEBVTT

02:53.724 --> 02:55.747
Hey, Alexx, you get
anything on the jumper ?

02:55.755 --> 02:57.988
Wasn't a jumper, Calleigh,
he was shot.

02:57.995 --> 02:59.788
Got an entrance wound,
no exit.

02:59.795 --> 03:01.147
That doesn't
make any sense.

03:01.155 --> 03:02.836
There are no signs of a
struggle in his apartment.

03:02.844 --> 03:05.190
Did the landlord say he was
a visitor or renter ?

03:05.195 --> 03:07.598
He's a renter.
Name's Billy Gault.

03:07.624 --> 03:10.158
Well, Billy Boy
upset somebody.

03:10.165 --> 03:12.275
You get anything on
firearms, will you call me ?

03:12.366 --> 03:14.560
Oh, you'll have
to take a number, sweetheart.

03:14.563 --> 03:15.595
I've got another stop.

03:15.711 --> 03:17.175
A triple on the Causeway.

03:17.175 --> 03:18.796
Three on the Causeway ?

03:19.789 --> 03:21.931
Looks like I'm taking
the back road.

03:34.075 --> 03:35.531
The jumper on 38th Street

03:35.535 --> 03:37.993
is a 782-4. GSW.

03:38.655 --> 03:39.370
Yeah.

03:40.317 --> 03:43.051
I collected some evidence from
the street and the vic's apartment.

03:43.067 --> 03:44.963
I think I could get us
the shooter.

03:46.066 --> 03:47.681
All righty, I'll see you in 20.

05:17.268 --> 05:18.140
Calleigh ?

05:19.887 --> 05:20.843
Calleigh.

05:22.288 --> 05:23.160
Calleigh.

05:27.975 --> 05:30.030
I don't want you to move
till we check you out.

05:30.046 --> 05:31.780
The paramedics are
on the way.

05:32.087 --> 05:33.610
The evidence is...

05:33.625 --> 05:36.431
Right now, sweetheart,
that's not important.

05:43.006 --> 05:44.411
But it's all compromised.

05:44.426 --> 05:46.172
Yes, everything

05:46.468 --> 05:47.792
but you, ma'am.

05:48.276 --> 05:51.282
CSI Miami Season 5 Episode 2
"If looks could kill"

06:37.405 --> 06:38.901
What can you remember ?

06:38.915 --> 06:41.912
It was a blur, it...
It just came out of nowhere.

06:42.977 --> 06:43.671
Okay.

06:44.386 --> 06:46.132
I'm an unreliable witness.

06:46.147 --> 06:47.551
No worries.

06:47.566 --> 06:48.540
Calleigh,

06:48.746 --> 06:49.711
you okay ?

06:49.786 --> 06:50.993
Yeah, I'm okay.

06:50.996 --> 06:53.510
Somebody doesn't want your
evidence to see the light of day.

06:53.527 --> 06:56.252
Can you think of anything,
something for us to go on ?

06:59.776 --> 07:01.110
The car was black...

07:01.765 --> 07:03.131
maybe.
I don't know.

07:04.375 --> 07:06.012
No worries, ma'am. Eric ?

07:11.548 --> 07:13.282
I'm going to need you
in the water, Eric.

07:13.287 --> 07:15.781
- What am I looking for ?
- Anything from the other vehicle.

07:15.796 --> 07:16.800
And Eric,

07:16.946 --> 07:18.910
that Hummer
doesn't leave your sight.

07:32.706 --> 07:34.751
Hey, I thought
they sent you home.

07:35.045 --> 07:36.160
They did.

07:38.858 --> 07:39.762
I'm fine.

07:41.175 --> 07:43.433
Unfortunately, the canal water
has contaminated

07:43.446 --> 07:45.502
anything with prints or DNA.

07:52.896 --> 07:55.243
And the clothes are all drenched,
so that just leaves us

07:55.245 --> 07:57.342
with photographs and documents.

08:01.398 --> 08:03.930
The mud scraped the emulsion
right off the film.

08:11.536 --> 08:12.410
What is that ?

08:15.065 --> 08:16.773
Looks like a note.
The leather of the wallet

08:16.785 --> 08:18.853
may have protected
just enough of it.

08:18.868 --> 08:21.562
There isn't much handwriting,
but there's a definite imprint.

08:21.575 --> 08:23.971
Let me get this to QD.
It's a long shot,

08:24.138 --> 08:26.241
but maybe they can
save some of this.

08:27.068 --> 08:27.871
And hey,

08:28.965 --> 08:30.423
I'm glad you're okay.

08:30.545 --> 08:31.783
Thanks, babe.

08:33.857 --> 08:35.553
<i>- Duquesne.
- Yeah, Calleigh.</i>

08:35.695 --> 08:36.652
Listen, you were right.

08:36.666 --> 08:38.741
The vehicle that ran you
off the road was black.

08:39.006 --> 08:40.909
I turned up a piece
of grille work.

08:40.928 --> 08:43.022
Are you going to be able
to get a make off of it ?

08:43.044 --> 08:45.493
As  soon as I do, I'll put out
a BOLO, all right ?

08:45.507 --> 08:46.523
<i>Fantastic.</i>

08:46.835 --> 08:47.741
Thanks, Eric.

08:47.766 --> 08:48.593
You got it.

08:53.626 --> 08:55.272
Is this the waterlogged paper ?

08:56.426 --> 08:57.110
Yeah.

08:57.398 --> 08:58.562
Take a look at this.

08:59.057 --> 09:01.381
When you write on a piece of paper,
the pigment remains

09:01.395 --> 09:03.161
on the surface,
but the solvent

09:03.175 --> 09:05.271
it gets absorbed into the fibers.

09:09.638 --> 09:12.171
So the water washes away
the pigment, but not the solvent.

09:12.187 --> 09:15.141
Exactly, but by adding
and subtracting different light

09:15.158 --> 09:18.773
and filters, we can actually make
the solvent reveal itself to us.

09:19.867 --> 09:23.273
Okay, I'm going to go
below 400 nanometers.

09:25.137 --> 09:27.323
"4 :00 p. m.
Tell them V-Ray sent you."

09:27.335 --> 09:28.831
Unfortunately, ultraviolet light

09:28.847 --> 09:30.463
can't tell you who V-Ray is.

09:30.578 --> 09:33.662
But that insignia
right there just might.

09:33.687 --> 09:34.803
What is it ?

09:34.917 --> 09:37.780
That is a symbol for
a motorcycle gang patch.

09:38.375 --> 09:40.251
Didn't take you for a biker chick.

09:40.836 --> 09:44.022
No, but my ex broke
a gang member's jaw

09:44.038 --> 09:45.873
in a bar fight,
six years ago in Atlanta,

09:45.886 --> 09:48.481
and that insignia was
on his patch.

09:48.486 --> 09:49.681
Sounds scary.

09:49.905 --> 09:51.461
Yeah, they're the scariest.

09:51.806 --> 09:53.220
Called the Crypt Kings and

09:53.246 --> 09:55.242
they are known
as being one-percenters.

09:55.245 --> 09:56.451
One-percenters ?

09:56.468 --> 09:59.362
99% of them just like to ride,
but that one percent

09:59.685 --> 10:02.382
they're into everything criminal :
Girls, guns, dope.

10:02.495 --> 10:04.410
So this V-Ray's got
to be pretty hardcore.

10:06.137 --> 10:08.271
So... mister V-Ray,

10:08.966 --> 10:11.902
where do the... Crypt Kings
operate out of ?

10:14.356 --> 10:15.281
No can do.

10:15.295 --> 10:17.123
You know, I find that
hard to believe.

10:20.278 --> 10:23.000
Listen, we didn't have anything
to do with Billy's death.

10:23.805 --> 10:25.390
Hell, he was one of us.

10:25.676 --> 10:27.131
Look at our rival gang :

10:27.176 --> 10:28.621
the Iron Reapers.

10:30.286 --> 10:32.451
- That's where the war is.
- I've heard enough.

10:33.417 --> 10:35.220
- Officer.
- Come on, let's go.

10:36.227 --> 10:38.243
We've got to
find his gang.

10:38.345 --> 10:40.782
- I'll put out a BOLO.
- That will take too long.

10:40.797 --> 10:43.271
- What are you thinking ?
- Frank, this city has ears,

10:43.288 --> 10:45.251
so let's use them.

10:51.328 --> 10:52.152
Cooper...

10:52.718 --> 10:54.132
you remember the...

10:54.966 --> 10:58.291
acoustic speakers PD put up
around the city a couple years ago ?

10:58.367 --> 11:00.441
You mean the sensors
to pinpoint gunfire.

11:00.457 --> 11:01.151
Yeah, uh...

11:02.387 --> 11:03.710
can you tap the records ?

11:03.985 --> 11:06.323
Pull the block on the
Billy Gault murder ?

11:07.337 --> 11:09.411
Yeah, but with all the Harleys
at the scene,

11:09.436 --> 11:11.253
sensors might not pick
up a gunshot.

11:11.957 --> 11:13.093
Track the backfire.

11:22.028 --> 11:24.752
Follow them like bread crumbs
to the gang's front door.

11:24.768 --> 11:26.380
Man, I'm impressed.

11:26.396 --> 11:27.872
Yeah ?
Thank you.

11:30.077 --> 11:32.183
Okay, this is where
the shooting occurred.

11:34.558 --> 11:37.650
So...  that's the path the motorcycles
took out of that grid.

11:37.738 --> 11:38.510
Yeah.

11:38.527 --> 11:41.122
Okay, I'll search further,
look for similar incident markers.

11:41.137 --> 11:42.892
Could give us direction.

11:46.028 --> 11:47.393
- Why'd it stop ?
- I don't know.

11:47.407 --> 11:48.552
Scent just went cold.

11:48.568 --> 11:50.820
Well, maybe that was
their destination. What's there ?

11:53.356 --> 11:55.170
Nothing but a few warehouses.

11:57.556 --> 11:59.720
All a motorcycle
gang needs.

12:00.303 --> 12:01.395
Horatio,

12:01.991 --> 12:02.945
we found them.

12:07.795 --> 12:09.076
Miami-Dade PD !

12:09.469 --> 12:10.601
Get your hands up !

12:13.467 --> 12:15.843
Angela, out the back,
out the back !

12:15.857 --> 12:17.183
Calm down.

12:26.977 --> 12:28.222
Turn it off !

12:30.178 --> 12:32.722
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

12:32.815 --> 12:34.011
You, too, ma'am.

12:34.048 --> 12:35.352
He didn't do anything.

12:35.356 --> 12:36.621
- Hawk was just...
- Shut it !

12:36.656 --> 12:37.433
Now,

12:37.776 --> 12:40.510
remove your weapon and
lay it on the ground slowly.

12:40.657 --> 12:42.053
I got a permit to carry.

12:42.068 --> 12:44.160
I don't care.
Put it down.

12:49.668 --> 12:51.342
So, what were you running from ?

12:51.358 --> 12:52.501
Nothing, man.

12:52.776 --> 12:54.893
Hey, if you're trying
to corner me, forget it.

12:54.896 --> 12:56.053
I didn't kill Billy Gault.

12:56.068 --> 12:58.530
You just happened to be
outside the scene, right ?

12:58.547 --> 13:00.921
Yeah, well,
we run there every week.

13:00.938 --> 13:03.382
- It's our territory.
- Not anymore, my friend.

13:03.397 --> 13:04.903
Now it's mine.

13:05.697 --> 13:07.663
So, you got something
to charge me with or what ?

13:07.668 --> 13:09.960
You will be the first to know.

13:09.966 --> 13:11.533
All right, listen up.

13:11.955 --> 13:14.521
Give up your I. D. s.
All we want to do is talk.

13:14.527 --> 13:16.771
Let's make this
as painless as possible.

13:17.857 --> 13:19.573
You need to step back right now.

13:20.196 --> 13:22.983
Oh, I would, but I don't
take orders from broads.

13:24.086 --> 13:25.893
Do as she says, cowboy.

13:26.317 --> 13:27.323
Line up.

13:27.335 --> 13:30.081
You best keep this bitch
on a shorter leash, Tex.

13:32.698 --> 13:35.021
So I guess you'll be
answering for everybody.

13:47.798 --> 13:48.481
So,

13:49.226 --> 13:50.593
you work under an alias ?

13:51.536 --> 13:53.171
For you, it's Jake Berkeley.

13:54.856 --> 13:56.480
When did you lateral
to the Feds ?

13:57.187 --> 13:58.560
I let you take me down.

13:58.576 --> 13:59.662
You know that, right ?

13:59.687 --> 14:01.333
Oh, that's right.
I forgot.

14:01.348 --> 14:02.492
Let's  see...

14:02.795 --> 14:05.611
you were first in our class,
the academy star.

14:05.926 --> 14:07.372
Only scared of failure.

14:07.395 --> 14:09.142
I mean, you could've been in first.

14:09.576 --> 14:12.193
If you weren't so distracted
by that guy you were seeing.

14:12.208 --> 14:13.961
What was his name ?

14:15.216 --> 14:16.670
Oh, yeah, that was me.

14:17.757 --> 14:19.473
Billy Gault was a biker
with the Crypt Kings.

14:19.488 --> 14:20.761
How well did you know him ?

14:22.167 --> 14:24.480
Well enough to know
his real name was Ken McCarthy.

14:24.537 --> 14:26.603
Are you saying
he's one of us ?

14:27.128 --> 14:27.853
Yeah.

14:28.418 --> 14:29.692
We were both

14:29.767 --> 14:32.673
investigating an ongoing
criminal conspiracy.

14:32.685 --> 14:34.101
Conspiracy to what ?

14:34.538 --> 14:35.832
That's classified.

14:36.455 --> 14:39.223
Someone ran me off the road
to stall the investigation.

14:39.245 --> 14:41.941
If you don't help me, I can't find out
who killed your partner.

14:42.797 --> 14:44.741
I'm sorry that happened to you.

14:46.775 --> 14:47.891
But I do that,

14:48.266 --> 14:51.080
and I blow the indictments and
compromise two years worth of work.

14:53.005 --> 14:56.122
You know, you're the perfect man
to infiltrate a biker gang.

14:56.925 --> 14:57.901
Yeah.

14:59.607 --> 15:02.572
Your relationships always have
ulterior motive.

15:04.827 --> 15:07.801
Look, I do care what
happened to our agent...

15:09.597 --> 15:12.053
... but I can't step out
for you, Calleigh.

15:14.907 --> 15:16.673
Some things never change.

15:30.557 --> 15:31.593
Lieutenant Caine ?

15:34.695 --> 15:35.851
Mrs. McCarthy.

15:36.715 --> 15:39.081
Mrs. McCarthy,
I'm sorry for your loss.

15:40.816 --> 15:41.992
Thank  you for calling.

15:42.797 --> 15:44.693
Ken's colleagues
at ATF--

15:45.095 --> 15:46.690
they won't answer
my questions

15:46.937 --> 15:48.703
or let me see his body.

15:50.145 --> 15:51.891
He was my husband.

15:52.505 --> 15:55.103
How much did you know about
what your husband was doing ?

15:55.565 --> 15:57.163
He couldn't tell me anything.

15:57.555 --> 16:00.981
Last time he was home, he mentioned
he was getting closer to indictments.

16:02.447 --> 16:04.581
I just wanted him out
of the whole thing.

16:04.938 --> 16:06.690
But he couldn't get out,
could he ?

16:08.577 --> 16:11.441
It was... like...
talking to an addict.

16:12.705 --> 16:14.603
The end was always tomorrow.

16:14.716 --> 16:18.013
The flash drive you mentioned on
the phone, do you still have it ?

16:18.995 --> 16:19.792
Yeah...

16:20.078 --> 16:22.183
I found this minus computer.

16:22.648 --> 16:25.120
Okay, Mrs. McCarthy, if there's
anything else I can do,

16:25.137 --> 16:27.043
you don't hesitate
to call me, all right ?

16:27.055 --> 16:27.923
I'll be here.

16:29.567 --> 16:31.143
- Thank you.
- Okay...

16:44.666 --> 16:46.653
- Is that Gault's wife ?
- It was.

16:46.657 --> 16:47.823
Mr. Wolfe,

16:47.828 --> 16:50.002
please do your magic on that.

16:50.046 --> 16:51.011
Will do.

16:54.145 --> 16:55.910
Is this the wife's flash drive ?

16:55.916 --> 16:58.170
Yeah, it's got a bunch of notes.
Her husband was building a case

16:58.186 --> 16:59.633
toward an indictment.

16:59.647 --> 17:01.013
Take a look at these photos.

17:04.107 --> 17:06.833
Think about how good you got to be
to get in tight with these guys.

17:06.848 --> 17:08.573
Hard to get in,
easy to stay.

17:08.588 --> 17:10.872
According  to those notes,
the gang's running guns.

17:10.887 --> 17:13.101
Yeah, several calibers
were mentioned.

17:14.926 --> 17:17.232
Including one called a C... S.

17:17.248 --> 17:18.462
What is that, a CS ?

17:18.468 --> 17:19.609
I don't know.

17:19.617 --> 17:21.542
Well, is it a rifle,
or a bazooka,

17:21.546 --> 17:23.890
or a handgun ?
I mean, you're the firearms expert.

17:23.964 --> 17:27.361
I don't know. I haven't heard of CS
in any of my weapons seminars.

17:27.376 --> 17:29.391
I do know, however,
that the only reason

17:29.407 --> 17:32.383
to design a new gun is for
a better way to kill people.

17:33.008 --> 17:34.941
So we're looking for
something pretty unique.

17:39.677 --> 17:41.371
Is this the one that ran
Calleigh off the road ?

17:41.385 --> 17:43.900
Yeah. We got it
at the warehouse bust.

17:53.735 --> 17:55.023
You sound disappointed.

17:55.038 --> 17:57.072
Whoever was driving it
was a pro.

17:57.075 --> 17:58.903
They wiped down everything
the steering wheel,

17:58.918 --> 18:00.252
dash, gear shift.

18:00.278 --> 18:01.502
Can I take a look at it ?

18:01.518 --> 18:04.190
Natalia, you don't need to ask
permission to work a case, okay ?

18:04.216 --> 18:06.232
As a matter of fact,
the more you ask,...

18:06.418 --> 18:08.053
... the more we think
you can't do it.

18:11.917 --> 18:13.542
Then get out of my way.

18:13.768 --> 18:15.590
That's what I'm talking about.

18:21.475 --> 18:23.131
Would you say
the guys in the...

18:23.145 --> 18:25.362
gang are about six feet tall ?

18:25.437 --> 18:27.412
Yeah. Give or take.

18:28.937 --> 18:31.723
Because the seat's pretty
close to the steering wheel.

18:33.967 --> 18:36.962
And it looks like it's adjusted
for somebody closer to five feet,...

18:37.418 --> 18:39.992
which would suggest a female.

18:43.015 --> 18:45.801
I'll bet the driver forgot
to wipe that part down.

18:49.086 --> 18:51.411
We found your skin cells
in the pickup truck.

18:51.485 --> 18:53.392
You ran our CSI off the road.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.870
And you killed Billy Gault, too ?

18:57.215 --> 18:58.422
Let's go, Angela.

18:58.437 --> 19:00.843
Okay, you've got a record.
It's not exactly spotless.

19:01.498 --> 19:03.601
Look, a lot of the guys
were starting to talk.

19:04.265 --> 19:06.301
That maybe Billy was
skimming off the top.

19:06.518 --> 19:07.523
What do you mean ?

19:07.536 --> 19:09.122
He balanced our books,...

19:09.728 --> 19:10.980
... handled all our money.

19:11.308 --> 19:13.782
What, was he, like,
the gang treasurer ?

19:14.128 --> 19:14.770
Yeah.

19:15.878 --> 19:19.731
Yeah, we're an organization, lady. We
got a president, a secretary, all that.

19:20.168 --> 19:21.192
What do you do ?

19:24.528 --> 19:26.560
I just do what I'm told,
that's all.

19:28.207 --> 19:30.183
That's my place.
I'm okay with that.

19:30.947 --> 19:33.093
You're not a piece of property,
Angela.

19:33.798 --> 19:36.302
I know what that kind
of fear feels like.

19:38.088 --> 19:39.560
Don't take the fall for him.

19:43.717 --> 19:45.412
I ain't scared like you.

19:45.716 --> 19:46.610
Really ?

19:47.635 --> 19:50.030
See, if that was true,
you wouldn't have killed for him.

19:52.737 --> 19:55.880
Look, my job was to run that chick
off the road. That's all.

20:05.865 --> 20:07.411
What are you trying
to cover up ?

20:07.857 --> 20:09.640
What does Billy have
on your gang ?

20:10.047 --> 20:11.641
You won't get that from me.

20:17.068 --> 20:19.621
Concerned about her testimony,
Hawk ?

20:21.825 --> 20:22.521
No.

20:23.965 --> 20:25.693
She knows what's good for her.

20:25.708 --> 20:27.580
I know you're running guns.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.223
Oh ? Won't let up, huh ?

20:30.777 --> 20:33.090
You're so hard up to
get me on something ?

20:33.527 --> 20:35.613
Hey, I didn't pay the license
on my rottweiler.

20:35.635 --> 20:37.813
Maybe I'll add that to the list.

20:37.898 --> 20:38.890
Beat it.

20:46.085 --> 20:48.760
Did you recover the round
from our vic, Billy Gault ?

20:48.778 --> 20:50.733
It was lodged in his scapula.

20:50.758 --> 20:53.163
That doesn't make any sense.
If it entered in his stomach,

20:53.165 --> 20:55.400
how did it end up all the
way in his shoulder blade ?

20:56.458 --> 20:58.792
It entered at
a steep initial angle,...

20:59.417 --> 21:00.911
passed through the stomach,...

21:02.187 --> 21:03.833
then his heart

21:03.878 --> 21:05.420
up to the shoulder blade.

21:05.425 --> 21:06.481
That doesn't make any sense.

21:06.518 --> 21:08.891
That means the shooter would've had
to have been in the apartment,

21:08.905 --> 21:11.983
- lying on the floor.
- Oh, that would be close proximity.

21:12.018 --> 21:13.811
There's no GSR on his body.

21:13.826 --> 21:17.312
There's no GSR on the floor, either.
What about his clothes ?

21:17.586 --> 21:19.572
Lab results were negative, baby.

21:19.738 --> 21:23.113
Then that means, the shot had to have
come from below and at a distance.

21:23.645 --> 21:25.630
All right, I'm going
to go back to the scene.

21:26.587 --> 21:27.360
Thank you.

21:36.736 --> 21:38.392
Wound tract was front to back

21:38.405 --> 21:40.673
at an upwards 75 degree angle.

21:42.777 --> 21:45.201
Means our vic stood on
the balcony when he got hit.

21:46.368 --> 21:47.543
Exactly.

21:57.936 --> 22:00.792
No way the shooter was on the
sidewalk. There's too many witnesses.

22:02.105 --> 22:04.090
Maybe he wasn't leaning
that far forward.

22:08.346 --> 22:10.162
Let's check out those columns.

22:11.207 --> 22:11.961
Yeah.

22:15.685 --> 22:18.361
So the shooter used these
columns for concealment.

22:21.308 --> 22:23.240
But you can't even see
the building from here.

22:23.668 --> 22:25.521
Shooter'd have to be out here
in the open.

22:34.295 --> 22:36.973
Would you give a lady
a boost, kind sir ?

22:36.997 --> 22:37.883
Sure.

22:44.046 --> 22:45.991
I've got flakes and scrapes.

22:46.005 --> 22:48.473
Something came in contact
with the column here.

22:55.837 --> 22:57.871
It's positive for GSR.

22:58.346 --> 23:00.151
The gun rested on this corner.

23:01.488 --> 23:02.583
Will you get me down ?

23:02.765 --> 23:03.842
Okay.

23:08.558 --> 23:11.461
Still doesn't explain how the
suspect could stand here...

23:12.145 --> 23:13.313
and hit the target.

23:13.698 --> 23:14.803
You know what ?

23:15.048 --> 23:16.682
I think he used a CS.

23:17.235 --> 23:18.310
A what ?

23:18.328 --> 23:20.763
In Billy Gault's notes, he said
that the Crypt Kings

23:20.778 --> 23:23.450
were dealing
a large number of CS's.

23:23.456 --> 23:26.082
In this case I think
"CS" means Corner Shot.

23:26.098 --> 23:26.921
What is it ?

23:26.937 --> 23:28.582
It's a high-tech restricted weapon.

23:28.586 --> 23:30.410
The Israelis were working
on a prototype.

23:30.427 --> 23:32.322
I  didn't even realize
they'd perfected it.

23:38.828 --> 23:41.452
So, it's a... a gun that
shoots around corners ?

23:41.465 --> 23:43.213
It's actually housing for a pistol.

23:43.225 --> 23:45.681
The pistol goes inside,
the housing pivots,

23:45.866 --> 23:47.810
it allows the shooter to aim
around the corner.

23:48.008 --> 23:49.741
It's a great way to hide
from plain sight.

23:57.348 --> 23:59.782
- Perfect for urban warfare.
- Yep.

24:07.216 --> 24:09.190
But fruit can hold DNA.

24:09.206 --> 24:11.602
A little brown.
Recently eaten.

24:11.965 --> 24:13.383
Worth a try.

24:22.358 --> 24:24.733
Jake, I know
about the corner shots.

24:25.016 --> 24:26.521
And it has come
to my attention

24:26.525 --> 24:28.472
that you and Billy
had a problem.

24:29.005 --> 24:31.263
So you've been speaking
to the Bureau execs.

24:33.245 --> 24:35.312
Okay, we weren't
the best of friends.

24:35.528 --> 24:37.251
The guy wanted to be
the case ace.

24:37.618 --> 24:39.670
- Be the hero.
- It's deeper than that Jake.

24:39.685 --> 24:41.001
He didn't trust you.

24:41.018 --> 24:42.660
Hey, in our world,

24:42.685 --> 24:45.113
- you can't trust anyone.
- I would agree.

24:47.988 --> 24:48.942
All right...

24:48.958 --> 24:50.200
Billy told me

24:50.217 --> 24:52.812
that he backed up everything
that he turned in to the Bureau.

24:52.915 --> 24:54.511
Photos, notes, everything.

24:54.525 --> 24:56.213
It's on a disk or something.

24:56.228 --> 24:57.730
Maybe the answer's there.

24:57.735 --> 24:58.522
Yeah...

24:59.045 --> 25:00.473
let's hope so.

25:15.916 --> 25:17.050
What did DNA say ?

25:17.055 --> 25:19.400
They couldn't extract enough
genetic material from the apple

25:19.418 --> 25:20.820
for a profile.

25:28.525 --> 25:30.410
Can you can get prints off
a piece of fruit ?

25:30.418 --> 25:31.751
It's not in my research books.

25:31.768 --> 25:33.940
Well, you got to keep up
on the journals, too.

25:33.986 --> 25:36.262
Skin of some fruits and vegetables
are actually a great surface

25:36.275 --> 25:37.273
to lift prints from.

25:37.296 --> 25:39.730
So the smoother the skin,
the longer the shelf life.

25:39.756 --> 25:41.652
Is there any kind of
special technique for it ?

25:41.665 --> 25:43.550
Yep, magnetic powder.

25:43.567 --> 25:45.533
Provides the best contrast.

26:04.085 --> 26:05.953
The dead agent's wife ?

26:07.668 --> 26:09.040
Grieving widow.

26:10.776 --> 26:12.462
I didn't kill my husband.

26:12.885 --> 26:14.290
But you admit you were there.

26:14.996 --> 26:17.632
I used to go by his place
a couple times a week.

26:26.386 --> 26:27.841
When I saw him...

26:28.277 --> 26:30.473
I felt better knowing
he was safe.

26:30.556 --> 26:33.192
How come you didn't tell us about
your criminal record, Suzanne ?

26:33.206 --> 26:34.861
the breaking and entering ?

26:35.758 --> 26:38.653
It was last year, when Ken
first got the assignment.

26:40.077 --> 26:41.682
I thought he was cheating on me.

26:42.275 --> 26:44.261
I wanted to catch him
in the act and

26:44.276 --> 26:45.962
I got a little irrational.

26:46.106 --> 26:49.020
And he denied it, of course.
Said it was all...

26:49.116 --> 26:50.343
"part of the job."

26:50.697 --> 26:52.950
So, were you acting irrational today ?

26:56.138 --> 26:57.283
You're a cop.

26:58.555 --> 27:00.333
You ever date someone
undercover ?

27:02.906 --> 27:05.330
At first, you think
it's a little exciting.

27:06.045 --> 27:08.073
Kind of like you're living in a movie.

27:08.196 --> 27:10.130
Then... after about...

27:10.726 --> 27:13.372
a hundred dinners alone,
it starts to sink in

27:13.386 --> 27:16.022
that this man I've met
and married,

27:16.737 --> 27:18.861
he's gotten so used to living
the movie that,

27:18.876 --> 27:20.082
suddenly...

27:20.366 --> 27:21.892
... I'm not real.

27:22.575 --> 27:24.273
Nothing normal is.

27:33.727 --> 27:35.072
I'm really sorry.

27:39.176 --> 27:40.362
Mr. Cooper.

27:40.367 --> 27:43.003
I was archiving these files
from the wife's flash drive.

27:43.015 --> 27:45.631
One of these photos isn't
like the rest. Check it out.

27:48.015 --> 27:51.412
That looks like Mrs. Gault may
have been right about her husband.

27:51.458 --> 27:53.942
Look at the size of that file :
5.6 megabytes.

27:53.947 --> 27:56.921
The rest of the photos on this
flash drive are all low-resolution.

27:56.937 --> 27:58.341
Only 500 K a piece.

27:58.368 --> 28:00.530
This photo's ten times
that size, isn't it ?

28:00.547 --> 28:02.511
And if I'm right,
the pixels of another photo

28:02.526 --> 28:04.512
are fused into the data
of this one.

28:04.527 --> 28:07.740
It's called Steganography. Terrorists
use it to communicate worldwide.

28:07.756 --> 28:11.052
Okay, so it's encrypted information.
Can you separate it ?

28:11.796 --> 28:13.233
Oh, I think so.

28:19.878 --> 28:22.622
Well, there's our boy,
Hawk Reed.

28:23.578 --> 28:25.800
Bring up one of those crates, please.

28:27.696 --> 28:29.612
So they're offloading guns

28:29.628 --> 28:31.422
at Bayfront Port.

28:37.208 --> 28:39.723
A couple hundred
of these Corner Shots here.

28:40.425 --> 28:41.961
About 9,000 apiece.

28:41.978 --> 28:44.600
Worth two million dollars purchased
from the Crypt Kings

28:44.618 --> 28:47.102
for sale to whom,
Mr. Andrews ?

28:47.108 --> 28:48.970
I purchased them for my friends.

28:49.246 --> 28:51.403
- They like to hunt.
- These weapons are restricted

28:51.406 --> 28:53.141
to law enforcement and military.

28:53.155 --> 28:54.481
Which means they're illegal.

28:54.498 --> 28:56.312
My dealer has
a Federal Firearms License.

28:56.328 --> 28:58.240
It's all perfectly legitimate.

28:58.258 --> 29:01.292
You're a war profiteer dealing
with an outlaw biker

29:01.305 --> 29:03.543
named Hawk, and I want to know
where he is.

29:03.565 --> 29:05.242
I don't much care, Lieutenant.

29:05.258 --> 29:06.861
Got the last shipment.

29:06.875 --> 29:07.982
It's all I want.

29:08.007 --> 29:10.823
You're under arrest for suspicion
of receiving stolen property.

29:11.615 --> 29:12.833
Put out a broadcast,

29:12.845 --> 29:15.483
armed and dangerous,
and I want birds in the air.

29:15.508 --> 29:16.991
<i>To Ground Unit,</i>

29:17.008 --> 29:19.770
<i>outstanding suspect
identified as Hawk Reed.</i>

29:19.775 --> 29:22.881
<i>Male, white, 35.
Considered armed and dangerous.</i>

29:22.896 --> 29:25.801
Last seen driving
a 2006 Harley Davidson.

29:25.817 --> 29:28.401
Florida plate : 455-140.

29:32.395 --> 29:33.210
Horatio.

29:41.686 --> 29:44.432
Heard you ran into
Seth Andrews at the port.

29:44.796 --> 29:46.110
What's going on ?

29:46.386 --> 29:48.472
Well, since you drove all
the way over here, Rick,

29:48.475 --> 29:49.830
why don't you tell me.

29:49.848 --> 29:51.731
Well, he's a Miami heavyweight.

29:51.745 --> 29:53.991
D.C. law firm
in his back pocket.

29:54.025 --> 29:56.290
Are you sitting in
that same back pocket ?

29:56.305 --> 29:57.013
No.

29:57.277 --> 29:59.303
I'm just saying he's a guy
you might want to leave alone.

29:59.307 --> 30:02.192
He's tied to this
motorcycle gang, Rick.

30:02.208 --> 30:03.842
Gun runners,
we've seen that before.

30:03.856 --> 30:05.583
These are tactical weapons.

30:05.595 --> 30:07.311
On the streets of Miami ?
Give me a break.

30:07.317 --> 30:10.630
My guess is that he's re-selling
them to someone in the Middle East.

30:10.965 --> 30:14.241
Now, here's my question to you,
are you going to help me or not ?

30:19.408 --> 30:21.202
I'll start with ATF,
see what they know.

30:21.218 --> 30:23.360
ATF is too low on
the food chain, Rick.

30:23.377 --> 30:26.270
Start higher, these are
weapons are for warfare.

30:26.688 --> 30:28.270
I'll get into it.

30:33.105 --> 30:34.200
Horatio.

30:34.407 --> 30:36.243
Oh, good.
Keep them there.

30:51.485 --> 30:52.741
Lieutenant Caine.

30:55.126 --> 30:58.130
Well, well,
guns and money.

30:58.147 --> 31:00.071
Check the rest,
Eric, please.

31:00.087 --> 31:02.273
Hey, you got no probable cause.

31:07.277 --> 31:09.643
Yo, man, that's an illegal
search, right there.

31:09.666 --> 31:11.071
Not if it's in plain sight,

31:11.097 --> 31:13.242
If I need a jailhouse lawyer,
I'll let you know.

31:18.915 --> 31:20.441
And while you're at it,

31:20.447 --> 31:22.363
impound those bikes.

31:30.956 --> 31:33.470
Check out the one we got
from Hawk's bike.

31:35.067 --> 31:36.641
Oh, yeah, what is this ?

31:36.665 --> 31:39.173
Some sort of residue
from the column across the street

31:39.185 --> 31:41.811
from the vic's apartment.
Tile or grout.

31:41.847 --> 31:44.681
Okay, so it places this
Corner Shot at the scene.

31:56.067 --> 31:58.523
Now, what about the Glock
that was in the housing ?

31:58.538 --> 32:01.043
I checked out Automated
Firearms there's no record,

32:01.055 --> 32:03.052
so I'm going to run it
through DOJ.

32:07.026 --> 32:10.180
Glock, semi-automatic, nine mil.

32:13.936 --> 32:15.960
It's registered to ATF.

32:16.775 --> 32:19.171
Special Agent Jake Berkeley ?

32:21.928 --> 32:23.442
Could I have a minute ?

32:25.437 --> 32:27.693
Yeah, okay, I'll step out.

32:36.098 --> 32:38.860
The murder of Billy Gault
is tied to you, Jake.

32:40.328 --> 32:41.591
What are you talking about ?

32:41.607 --> 32:44.760
We found a nine mil Glock registered
to you in the Corner Shot that killed him.

32:46.107 --> 32:48.551
The bikers deal
with Corner Shot systems.

32:48.567 --> 32:50.232
Doesn't mean I've handled it.

32:50.945 --> 32:52.730
What about the
Glock mounted to it ?

32:52.745 --> 32:54.781
It's a standard
issue firearm, Calleigh.

32:54.798 --> 32:55.960
I know that.

32:55.977 --> 32:58.741
Well, there must be some kind of
mix-up with your... your records.

32:59.937 --> 33:01.443
All right, well,
then let's make it easy :

33:01.456 --> 33:03.712
give me your Bureau gun,
I'll do a comparison.

33:06.376 --> 33:07.961
It's not that easy.

33:08.305 --> 33:09.901
My gun is missing.

33:10.715 --> 33:14.023
You know what, Jake, in my line of work,
we call that convenient.

33:15.156 --> 33:18.100
Are you familiar with motive
in your line of work ?

33:18.347 --> 33:19.982
What would mine be ?

33:20.426 --> 33:22.682
For killing Gault,
my partner.

33:22.755 --> 33:25.381
Horatio told me what kind of
partners you were.

33:27.528 --> 33:29.900
This isn't about
you and me, is it ?

33:32.548 --> 33:34.562
I've got one dead ATF agent,

33:34.577 --> 33:37.010
and you're missing
your standard-issue firearm.

33:37.116 --> 33:38.730
Trust me, Jake.
This time,

33:38.738 --> 33:40.671
It's all about you.

34:13.027 --> 34:14.810
Hey, Ryan said
you might have a break.

34:14.866 --> 34:17.572
Yeah. I recovered gunpowder
from the live rounds

34:17.585 --> 34:18.993
in Jake Berkeley's gun.

34:19.025 --> 34:19.960
Take a look.

34:25.054 --> 34:26.963
The grains are round.

34:26.987 --> 34:29.429
Now, here's a swab from the ejection
port we recovered from

34:29.447 --> 34:31.451
Hawk's Corner Shot.

34:33.295 --> 34:35.121
Those are diamond-shaped.

34:35.158 --> 34:36.522
It's different ammunition.

34:37.005 --> 34:38.831
This gunpowder's from
a separate weapon.

34:38.847 --> 34:40.300
Jake wasn't the shooter.

34:40.327 --> 34:43.391
No, someone slid the gun into
the housing after the shooting.

34:53.487 --> 34:55.543
So, basically, he was set up.

34:57.696 --> 34:59.881
So, Hawk, we looked
into the weapons

34:59.896 --> 35:01.910
that you sold to Seth Andrews

35:02.125 --> 35:03.651
at Bayfront Port.

35:07.586 --> 35:08.630
Yeah ?

35:08.745 --> 35:11.800
And what did the country club
ingrate Seth have to say ?

35:11.866 --> 35:13.990
He took the deal
and rolled over.

35:14.116 --> 35:16.052
Then Lieutenant Caine here
called a contact

35:16.066 --> 35:17.493
in D.C. with the feds.

35:17.507 --> 35:20.843
Your gang was making a buck
off stolen Israeli weapons.

35:20.876 --> 35:23.020
Then Seth Andrews
was reselling them

35:23.036 --> 35:25.302
to the Palestinian Army, Hawk.

35:25.307 --> 35:27.832
- They're a world away, brother.
- Not quite.

35:28.378 --> 35:30.082
Heard of the Patriot Act ?

35:30.465 --> 35:32.603
Makes you a terrorist
on American soil.

35:32.617 --> 35:34.053
You can't drop that on me.

35:34.078 --> 35:36.022
We already have, Hawk.

35:38.456 --> 35:39.280
Wait, wait, wait.

35:40.055 --> 35:41.202
I want to make a deal.

35:41.206 --> 35:42.892
You want to admit
to shooting Billy Gault ?

35:42.897 --> 35:43.932
But I didn't do that.

35:43.947 --> 35:45.362
But you did have
your girlfriend

35:45.375 --> 35:47.411
run my CSI off the road.

35:47.427 --> 35:50.312
You knew we had all the
evidence on your gun running.

35:52.146 --> 35:53.792
I couldn't afford
to let that out.

35:53.797 --> 35:56.693
So, yeah,
I'll take a fall for it.

35:57.478 --> 35:58.892
I'll sign a confession.

35:58.906 --> 36:01.580
And it will be too late.

36:01.598 --> 36:02.892
Take him.

36:04.348 --> 36:05.502
Interesting.

36:07.935 --> 36:09.113
What have you got ?

36:09.658 --> 36:12.573
The trigger guard there looks like
there's some kind of transfer on it.

36:15.598 --> 36:18.011
It's oily,
like packing grease, maybe.

36:18.027 --> 36:19.731
Could be from the real shooter.

36:19.747 --> 36:21.473
Let's have Eric
take a look at it.

36:23.967 --> 36:26.093
You brought me out here
for some window shopping ?

36:26.118 --> 36:27.332
Not quite.

36:27.435 --> 36:28.491
Could use a hand.

36:28.495 --> 36:31.451
Trace found on the Corner
Shot was motor oil.

36:31.758 --> 36:33.742
Viscosity says
it's from a motorcycle.

36:33.757 --> 36:35.593
Here you go.
Glove up.

36:37.148 --> 36:39.803
So we have to collect
oil samples from all of these.

36:39.816 --> 36:41.173
That's right.

36:54.237 --> 36:55.493
Problem, Coop ?

36:55.998 --> 36:57.620
No, no, no problem.

37:00.198 --> 37:02.001
You don't know where
the oil cap is, do you ?

37:02.006 --> 37:04.010
It's just more of
a four-wheel type guy.

37:04.028 --> 37:05.212
I got you.

37:05.527 --> 37:07.751
Step out.
Watch and learn.

37:10.437 --> 37:11.841
The oil cap.

37:26.918 --> 37:27.981
You got it ?

37:29.065 --> 37:30.251
Got it.

38:03.225 --> 38:05.683
You sure these are different enough
to register with the mass spec ?

38:05.695 --> 38:08.571
Yeah. Detergents and additives,
they vary from brand to brand.

38:08.596 --> 38:10.980
Okay, so what if some of
these guys use the same brand ?

38:10.997 --> 38:12.602
Then we rely
on the bikes.

38:12.606 --> 38:14.552
When engine parts rub together,
they slough off

38:14.566 --> 38:16.142
particles of iron and zinc.

38:22.815 --> 38:24.660
- And every bike is different.
- That's right.

38:24.677 --> 38:27.582
Custom bike leaves us
with custom motor oil.

38:27.598 --> 38:29.840
Now, the ICP mass spec,

38:29.858 --> 38:32.032
it's like a microscopic
metal detector.

38:32.037 --> 38:34.023
It'll tell us if our samples match.

39:07.206 --> 39:08.723
We've got a match.

39:09.895 --> 39:11.832
V-Ray Groves.

39:12.318 --> 39:14.171
So much for brotherhood.

39:15.446 --> 39:17.901
We found the motor
oil from your Harley

39:17.918 --> 39:19.832
on the trigger
of the murder weapon.

39:19.835 --> 39:22.232
You killed Billy Gault and
framed one of your brothers.

39:23.706 --> 39:25.452
No, I brought Billy in.

39:26.265 --> 39:27.611
I vouched for him.

39:28.177 --> 39:30.452
If Hawk had found out
he was a cop, I'd be dead.

39:33.676 --> 39:35.132
How'd you make him for a cop ?

39:35.316 --> 39:38.512
This broad, always hanging
out around his pad.

39:38.826 --> 39:40.633
She'd hide
every time he left.

39:50.448 --> 39:52.420
I found a way
to run her plates.

39:52.595 --> 39:53.932
Got an address.

40:03.327 --> 40:04.841
She was his old lady.

40:04.868 --> 40:07.241
And in that neighborhood man,
he was definitely a cop.

40:09.306 --> 40:11.122
Survival of the fittest.

40:12.227 --> 40:15.820
So you used your gang's bikes
to drown out the sound of the gunshot.

40:33.657 --> 40:35.941
Well, congratulations.
Job well done.

40:35.945 --> 40:37.423
He's dead, she's a widow.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.481
He looked me in the eye
for two years,

40:39.498 --> 40:41.182
said he'd always have my back.

40:42.296 --> 40:43.892
You say that
to a Crypt King...

40:46.026 --> 40:47.402
you better mean it.

41:12.807 --> 41:13.942
You got him.

41:15.285 --> 41:16.093
We did.

41:19.456 --> 41:21.550
I keep wondering, you know...

41:22.407 --> 41:24.552
wondering if
I could've done something

41:25.317 --> 41:26.812
to change
what happened to him.

41:26.867 --> 41:27.540
No.

41:28.685 --> 41:31.481
Your husband made a choice.
There was nothing you could have done.

41:32.945 --> 41:34.282
I'm mad at him.

41:36.028 --> 41:37.372
But I'm proud of him.

41:38.666 --> 41:39.652
You should be.

41:39.658 --> 41:42.150
Takes a very special human being

41:42.185 --> 41:44.442
to be able to do
that kind of a job.

41:56.077 --> 41:57.413
Thanks, man.

42:14.785 --> 42:17.123
I heard you've
been reassigned, Jake.

42:19.426 --> 42:21.242
Yeah, one too many visits
with you guys.

42:21.245 --> 42:22.793
It's bad for business.

42:23.145 --> 42:25.422
So is becoming
one of them, Jake.

42:25.748 --> 42:28.320
Hey, I'm a lot of things, but

42:28.605 --> 42:30.632
outlaw biker
isn't one of them.

42:31.485 --> 42:33.131
I looked into Billy's files,

42:33.148 --> 42:35.800
and it turns out
that you crossed the line.

42:36.686 --> 42:38.131
Bikes and booze.

42:38.276 --> 42:40.433
It's part of the game
a UC has to play.

42:40.458 --> 42:42.081
What about the drugs ?

42:44.978 --> 42:47.032
Listen, you got a
gun to your ear

42:47.045 --> 42:49.343
and some amped-up biker
saying you're a cop,

42:49.358 --> 42:50.560
you do what you have to do.

42:50.568 --> 42:53.433
Yes, but Billy didn't play it
that way, did he, Jake ?

42:53.666 --> 42:55.040
Billy played it clean.

42:55.056 --> 42:56.931
Yeah, and he got himself killed.

42:57.318 --> 42:59.982
Sometimes it's safer
to be on the dark side.

43:01.215 --> 43:03.243
I want you to listen to me.

43:03.627 --> 43:06.683
I had a brother who worked
undercover, just like you.

43:07.286 --> 43:10.243
And he crossed to the dark side
and never came back,

43:10.778 --> 43:11.491
Jake.

43:11.705 --> 43:13.501
He never came back.

43:16.466 --> 43:18.501
Well, that won't happen to me.

43:28.946 --> 43:30.830
Let's hope so, son.

43:31.927 --> 43:33.490
Let's hope so.
