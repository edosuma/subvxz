WEBVTT

00:02.089 --> 00:03.173
Yes!

00:04.257 --> 00:06.635
Yes, I'm here!

00:08.512 --> 00:11.181
What is it? What is it?

00:11.181 --> 00:13.266
I thought I lost you.

00:19.689 --> 00:22.734
Oh, God! Did you mean to do that?

00:22.734 --> 00:24.653
Think you broke my nose!

00:24.653 --> 00:27.697
Was that on purpose? Ed?

00:29.574 --> 00:32.285
Alright, everyone.
Great to see us all together here again.

00:32.285 --> 00:33.703
What happened to your face?

00:33.703 --> 00:35.372
Bet Blackbeard did that, didn't he?

00:35.372 --> 00:39.209
It was an accident.
Okay? I think Ed just sat up too quickly.

00:39.209 --> 00:40.252
That's what they all say.

00:40.252 --> 00:42.170
As you know,
he's gone through quite the ordeal

00:42.170 --> 00:44.214
and he does need to regain his strength.

00:44.214 --> 00:46.675
Yeah. He'll probably get around
to killing you after he's rested.

00:46.675 --> 00:48.593
Yeah, I'd say
it's a pretty obvious mistake

00:48.593 --> 00:49.845
letting him get strong again.

00:49.845 --> 00:51.138
Yes. Hello?

00:51.138 --> 00:52.472
Kick him off the ship already!

00:52.472 --> 00:54.057
- Facts, facts!
- Hey, hey, hang on.

00:54.057 --> 00:57.727
We don't just banish people, do we?
That's not us.

00:57.727 --> 01:00.856
Let's give him some time,
perhaps to rebound a bit.

01:01.314 --> 01:05.068
Medically speaking, the man can't speak,
and his brain is maybe couscous.

01:05.068 --> 01:06.695
Also, gonna need that steak back.

01:06.695 --> 01:08.238
- It's dinner.
- Right. Yes, aye.

01:08.238 --> 01:09.781
Maybe we should put it to the vote.

01:10.365 --> 01:11.742
Do we have to do this now?

01:17.122 --> 01:19.624
Hello there, traveler.

01:20.500 --> 01:23.253
You've been down to the gravy basket,
haven't you?

01:24.129 --> 01:26.882
Been down there a few times myself.

01:27.632 --> 01:29.968
Did ya have a vision?

01:46.318 --> 01:47.319
Hey.

01:50.405 --> 01:52.324
He's seen better days, hasn't he?

01:52.324 --> 01:54.868
At least he's still got both legs!

01:55.202 --> 01:56.411
Yes!

01:57.162 --> 01:58.622
He can't hear you, he's got no head.

01:58.622 --> 02:01.833
You've got a head, though,
which you should

02:02.459 --> 02:04.753
- look after.
- What do you want, Bonnet?

02:06.379 --> 02:07.756
Well, here's the thing.

02:07.756 --> 02:12.052
The crew, they're in a bit of a deadlock
over the whole banishment of Ed thing

02:12.052 --> 02:14.096
and I just thought, seeing as, well,

02:14.096 --> 02:17.599
you were the one who kept his body aboard,
maybe you should weigh in.

02:17.599 --> 02:20.852
You've already murdered him once.
Seems like a pretty good payback.

02:22.062 --> 02:23.563
So, what do you think?

02:24.314 --> 02:25.732
My vote?

02:28.443 --> 02:31.947
A rotten leg's got to come off.

02:34.783 --> 02:35.784
Right.

02:41.164 --> 02:45.794
Just to confirm, was that a nay or yay
on the banishment?

02:48.922 --> 02:52.300
So! We, the crew of "The Revenge,"
have voted

02:52.300 --> 02:54.469
and we've chosen banishment, unfortunately.

02:54.469 --> 02:56.304
So, yeah. Effective immediately.

02:56.304 --> 02:58.723
Your complimentary dinghy
awaits you portside.

02:58.723 --> 02:59.850
- Now leave, please.
- Fuck off.

02:59.850 --> 03:01.143
Alright. Rude.

03:04.062 --> 03:04.896
Fuck you.

03:04.896 --> 03:07.607
It's the first time I've been on this side
of a walk of shame.

03:07.607 --> 03:10.902
- Way to make this awkward, bruh.
- Shitty sailing with you.

03:11.695 --> 03:13.864
You're making it really hard
to look up to you, man.

03:13.864 --> 03:16.450
Hey, made you this sandwich for the trip.

03:18.452 --> 03:20.078
Don't you want your sammie?

03:22.289 --> 03:25.250
Ed? Say something, at least.

03:28.378 --> 03:31.715
You're not a fuckin' mermaid.

03:35.218 --> 03:36.303
What?

03:43.518 --> 03:47.397
I'm no mermaid?
What does that mean?

03:48.440 --> 03:51.610
Pay him no heed.
He's still half-dead.

03:52.569 --> 03:55.572
Here. Walk with me over yonder.

03:55.906 --> 03:57.324
I'll explain.

03:57.991 --> 03:59.659
I'm huntin' for a vessel.

04:00.744 --> 04:02.454
So's I can turn into a bird.

04:04.289 --> 04:06.583
Alright. Fine. Yeah.

04:07.959 --> 04:09.294
Let's do it.

04:12.380 --> 04:13.465
So

04:15.050 --> 04:17.636
here I go again on my own.

04:17.636 --> 04:19.596
Fuck off, nature.

04:20.097 --> 04:22.182
Walkin' down the only road
I've ever known.

04:23.391 --> 04:25.227
Like a gyp--

04:26.061 --> 04:27.270
A wolf.

04:32.692 --> 04:34.611
Are you a friend, Wolf?

04:36.488 --> 04:39.866
I don't even know why I got this one.
It's a big spider.

04:39.866 --> 04:41.868
I don't even like spiders,
but I thought maybe

04:41.868 --> 04:45.247
I'd be able to get over my fear of spiders
if I got a big spider on my hand.

04:45.247 --> 04:46.915
But every time I look at it, I freak out.

04:46.915 --> 04:49.209
So that's why I wear those black
leather gloves.

04:49.209 --> 04:52.129
God, look how much I'm opening up to you.

04:52.129 --> 04:54.506
I feel like I've just
found my new best friend.

04:54.506 --> 04:56.425
We're just like two lone wolves,
you and me.

04:56.425 --> 05:01.096
It's a very rare thing,
to find someone who understands you.

05:02.222 --> 05:04.808
You'll always be safe with me. Okay?

05:07.686 --> 05:11.106
What the fuck? What the fuck?
Who the fuck did that?

05:12.733 --> 05:14.735
- Teach?
- Read?

05:15.402 --> 05:19.114
- What the fuck?
- Oh, my God.

05:20.866 --> 05:24.494
Well, it really does sound like hell,
this gravy bucket thing.

05:24.494 --> 05:28.665
Betwixt hell and high heaven,
to be more precise.

05:28.665 --> 05:33.545
So he escaped,
but now he's sort of unmoored?

05:33.545 --> 05:38.383
Aye. Can't tell what's real
and what's the basket anymore.

05:43.847 --> 05:46.850
They'll have a beaut of a vessel in there.

05:57.277 --> 06:00.906
Hello! Are these things for sale?

06:02.074 --> 06:04.367
They are available, yes.

06:04.367 --> 06:06.495
For lovers of beauty.

06:07.079 --> 06:10.040
Well, my friend is looking for a bowl.

06:10.040 --> 06:15.629
Specifically, somethin' suitable
for an avian transmogrification ceremony.

06:15.629 --> 06:18.090
Yes, he's turning into a bird, apparently.

06:19.382 --> 06:21.885
Well, you might wanna check
down yonder by the headboards.

06:21.885 --> 06:22.928
Have a little dig around.

06:22.928 --> 06:24.179
Superb.

06:26.932 --> 06:31.353
Oh, my God.
This is a Louis XIV Giltwood console!

06:32.020 --> 06:35.023
Look at the detailing! That is exquisite.

06:36.358 --> 06:39.069
Don't you have an incredible eye?

06:39.069 --> 06:41.696
Anne Bonny. Collector.

06:41.696 --> 06:43.949
Stede Bonnet. Lover of beauty.

06:44.533 --> 06:45.617
Annie!

06:46.576 --> 06:48.161
Look who I fuckin' found.

06:48.161 --> 06:49.955
Where's my Annie fuckin' Bonny?

06:49.955 --> 06:52.040
Eddie motherfucking Teach!

06:52.040 --> 06:54.876
Oh, my darling! Fuck.

06:54.876 --> 06:57.754
Good to see you. Yes, it is.

06:58.755 --> 07:00.590
Hello, Edward.

07:02.175 --> 07:04.094
Jesus Christ. Here we go.

07:04.970 --> 07:05.929
Hi.

07:08.140 --> 07:09.891
I wasn't looking for you, by the way.

07:09.891 --> 07:11.643
Mate, I don't care if you were.

07:13.437 --> 07:15.480
Wait, you two know each other?

07:15.480 --> 07:18.358
- What are the fuckin' odds?
- Very high, apparently.

07:18.358 --> 07:21.194
- Shipmates.
- Former.

07:22.946 --> 07:25.490
- Well, you should both stay for dinner.
- Yeah.

07:25.490 --> 07:28.827
I don't wanna make him feel uncomfortable.

07:29.453 --> 07:32.539
Him? Hey, look, you do whatever you want.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.166
You're good at that.

07:35.167 --> 07:37.252
I mean, I could.

07:37.794 --> 07:40.714
Potentially, I could have dinner.

07:41.673 --> 07:42.632
Whatever.

07:42.632 --> 07:45.010
- Whatever.
- Whatever.

07:45.719 --> 07:49.306
Is it just me or does the energy
around here seem off?

07:49.306 --> 07:52.392
By "the energy," do we mean him?

07:56.188 --> 07:57.397
Or him?

07:57.731 --> 08:01.318
Well, mythical creature?

08:01.318 --> 08:03.528
Anything to say for yourself?

08:04.863 --> 08:07.282
Fuck you!

08:07.282 --> 08:08.492
Or them?

08:11.036 --> 08:12.621
Do you still see blood?

08:12.621 --> 08:14.956
Yeah. We'll get it. Just keep scrubbing.

08:17.042 --> 08:18.668
They're lookin' this way.

08:19.127 --> 08:22.839
They've got a feral quality.

08:22.839 --> 08:26.259
I hate to say it, but I think Blackbeard
really messed them up.

08:27.010 --> 08:28.804
I think I know what we should do for them.

08:28.804 --> 08:31.848
They just need to be reminded
that they have value.

08:31.848 --> 08:35.143
And that this is a safe space.

08:36.436 --> 08:38.647
<i>Sea la madre,</i>
they're definitely planning something.

08:38.647 --> 08:40.315
- Yeah.
- Sharp, innit.

08:40.315 --> 08:43.902
It's gonna be really disappointing
if we kill them in self-defense.

08:43.902 --> 08:45.445
- Yeah.
- Great scrubbing.

08:45.445 --> 08:47.114
So clean.

08:47.114 --> 08:48.698
So, the jail guard,

08:48.698 --> 08:51.284
with the most beautiful
eyes I've ever seen,

08:51.284 --> 08:54.079
pulls his entire fuckin' face off.

08:54.079 --> 08:57.791
Turns out, this one had sliced the face
off some Brit

08:57.791 --> 08:59.793
and come to my rescue.

09:00.877 --> 09:02.629
Now that's romance.

09:02.629 --> 09:07.467
The trick is, you gotta slice,
cut while ya peel.

09:07.467 --> 09:10.679
Most people, they try to muscle it,
and that's how ya tear a face.

09:10.679 --> 09:12.931
Quite the shift,
going from wearing people's faces

09:12.931 --> 09:14.766
to becoming antique collectors.

09:14.766 --> 09:17.227
So, what about you two?
How did you meet?

09:17.227 --> 09:21.857
Well, I'd been gut-stabbed
and he just so happened upon the ship

09:21.857 --> 09:23.442
I was bleeding out on.

09:23.442 --> 09:26.570
- Nice.
- Yes. Ed saved my life, actually.

09:26.570 --> 09:29.781
Well, actually,
I was planning on killing him myself.

09:29.781 --> 09:32.117
Burning his face off,
taking his identity, the whole lot.

09:32.117 --> 09:35.036
But he decided I wasn't going
to doggie heaven.

09:35.036 --> 09:36.329
More like I relented.

09:36.329 --> 09:40.250
And for a short time after that, at least,
we sailed the seas happily.

09:40.250 --> 09:41.960
Until he completely boned it.

09:42.753 --> 09:44.337
Can we not do this now?

09:44.337 --> 09:45.881
Can do it anytime I like.

09:47.424 --> 09:48.467
Fuckin' clock.

09:48.467 --> 09:50.385
Bollocks! I gotta go check on dinner.

09:54.139 --> 09:55.432
What happened to your beard?

09:55.432 --> 09:57.225
I liked it when it was longer better.

09:57.225 --> 09:59.811
Well, I got the crazy
notion to shave it off.

09:59.811 --> 10:01.605
- Immediately regretted it.
- Mary!

10:01.605 --> 10:03.815
Come and help me.
This rabbit is fucked!

10:03.815 --> 10:04.733
Coming!

10:05.233 --> 10:06.818
Fuckin' have to do everything around here.

10:06.818 --> 10:09.780
Fuckin' kill the rabbit,
fuckin' cook the rabbit.

10:09.780 --> 10:11.281
Fuck's sake.

10:12.824 --> 10:16.369
For what it's worth, I like your beard.
The length.

10:19.414 --> 10:20.624
Thank you.

10:24.753 --> 10:27.631
Buttons was saying something
about a gravy bowl

10:27.631 --> 10:30.926
and you're half-dead or something.

10:31.676 --> 10:33.970
- You really screwed it up this time.
- I'm fine.

10:34.888 --> 10:37.224
And maybe don't listen
to a man who's becoming a bird.

10:37.224 --> 10:39.476
- Don't touch me!
- I do as I please.

10:42.312 --> 10:43.438
There ya go, how's that?

10:45.607 --> 10:46.942
What the hell?

10:47.442 --> 10:50.153
Sorry. Sorry.
Dinner's gonna be a minute.

10:50.153 --> 10:54.032
Someone forgot to take the intestines
out of the rabbit.

10:54.032 --> 10:57.244
Nobody minds a bit of shit
on their rabbit.

10:57.244 --> 10:59.162
- Top up?
- Yeah.

11:03.792 --> 11:05.293
You've got a thing.

11:06.086 --> 11:07.754
On your-- In your back.

11:07.754 --> 11:09.923
You got something sticking
outta your shoulder.

11:11.508 --> 11:12.342
Fuck me.

11:12.801 --> 11:13.635
Do you want a hand with that?

11:13.635 --> 11:16.888
No. Annie put it in there,
Annie can take it out.

11:18.014 --> 11:19.808
You want me to take it out now, do you?

11:20.725 --> 11:22.936
Is there a fuckin' echo in the room,
is there?

11:23.770 --> 11:24.813
Get over here.

11:25.397 --> 11:27.482
Flick it. Yeah. Flick it.

11:27.774 --> 11:30.402
How's that? How's that?
How's that?

11:30.402 --> 11:32.988
Six inches of silver in your scapula.

11:34.990 --> 11:36.742
It's inside.
How lovely and deep that is.

11:36.742 --> 11:37.826
We could leave if you want some

11:40.328 --> 11:41.413
privacy.

11:41.413 --> 11:44.291
Alright, you lot. Just this way.

11:44.291 --> 11:46.126
You gotta close your eyes
'cause it's a surprise.

11:46.126 --> 11:47.210
Oh, yeah, right.

11:47.210 --> 11:49.713
We're not too much
into surprises these days.

11:49.713 --> 11:53.049
Fair enough.
Anyway, brace yourselves.

11:58.764 --> 11:59.598
Fuck!

11:59.848 --> 12:02.559
Guys, it's called a pine-ata.

12:02.559 --> 12:05.687
Yeah. So, you just pull
this string and then--

12:05.687 --> 12:08.148
And then ya try to hit it with a stick!

12:10.442 --> 12:13.278
- Time for blindfolding.
- Stay the fuck away from me!

12:13.278 --> 12:16.323
You won't want to stay the fuck
away from this cake!

12:19.034 --> 12:20.786
God's sake, take it away!

12:23.246 --> 12:26.792
There's quite a bit of rabbit poop,
but I think we can salvage it.

12:28.001 --> 12:29.419
You're sensitive, aren't you?

12:31.254 --> 12:32.839
You appreciate things.

12:33.131 --> 12:37.135
You have taste.
Eddie was crazy to let you go.

12:38.261 --> 12:43.809
I'm not sure either of us have let go, exactly.

12:46.937 --> 12:48.146
Real smooth.

12:49.606 --> 12:51.191
Slowing down, old man.

12:51.191 --> 12:54.778
So, what was up with all the stabbing?

12:54.778 --> 12:57.489
Just something we do.
Keeps things fresh.

12:58.990 --> 13:00.450
Stede stabbed me once.

13:05.414 --> 13:06.456
<i>Had to make him do it.</i>

13:07.624 --> 13:08.792
He's so fragile.

13:10.669 --> 13:13.046
- You've got a type.
- Type?

13:13.046 --> 13:14.423
No, I don't.

13:14.423 --> 13:16.842
Artsy outsider was always your thing.

13:17.634 --> 13:21.346
- Bullshit.
- You're caught up in this whirlpool,

13:21.346 --> 13:23.056
just like me and Annie.

13:26.601 --> 13:29.354
I just didn't belong
back with my old life.

13:29.354 --> 13:31.064
Mary and the kids.

13:31.064 --> 13:34.943
And that was the second time
you left your wife, was it?

13:34.943 --> 13:36.737
Ex-wife.

13:37.404 --> 13:38.822
It feels funny to say that.

13:40.365 --> 13:42.993
You're a heartbreaker, Stede.

13:43.618 --> 13:45.662
Oh, I don't know about that.

13:46.163 --> 13:49.374
I mean, I may have wounded a heart or two.

13:49.374 --> 13:51.168
Coy boy. Wound this.

13:51.168 --> 13:53.503
They're gonna be so jealous.

13:53.503 --> 13:54.588
Look, I honestly--

13:55.297 --> 13:59.217
Nah. Knock off. Pile of junk.

14:00.093 --> 14:02.095
Buttons! You're still here?

14:02.095 --> 14:03.597
Eureka.

14:04.264 --> 14:05.891
This is not what it looks like.

14:05.891 --> 14:08.393
I had a sore back and she's

14:08.894 --> 14:10.437
medically trained?

14:12.272 --> 14:15.484
- Are you alright?
- I don't feel good.

14:22.074 --> 14:25.077
Look, she poisoned me.

14:25.077 --> 14:26.119
What?

14:33.502 --> 14:37.506
One-half of this room
has some serious emotional problems.

14:37.506 --> 14:39.591
- And it's not us.
- Well, it's not us!

14:40.634 --> 14:43.637
Right, so, is everybody else's arms
and various limbs getting tired?

14:43.637 --> 14:44.554
Yep.

14:44.554 --> 14:46.014
Alright, look. Look, look, look.

14:46.014 --> 14:48.517
I think there's actually an easier way
to resolve this.

14:48.517 --> 14:51.269
Yes? Right. So you all think
that we're plottin' against you?

14:51.269 --> 14:54.398
Yeah, yeah.
Which, in hindsight, maybe was inaccurate.

14:54.398 --> 14:56.358
- I don't know. You tell me.
- Okay. So, can we all agree

14:56.358 --> 15:00.612
to just not jump the other crew
and solve this as fuckin' adults?

15:00.612 --> 15:04.741
You're saying this is like
a space that is safe?

15:04.741 --> 15:05.784
- Yeah.
- Yeah, babe.

15:05.784 --> 15:07.035
- I love that.
- A safe space.

15:11.748 --> 15:13.250
A lot has gone unsaid.

15:13.250 --> 15:17.379
I think now is a great time to discuss
lingering issues.

15:17.379 --> 15:19.297
Yeah, yeah, absolutely.

15:19.297 --> 15:22.551
Can we talk about the fucked-up
sleeping arrangements?

15:22.551 --> 15:24.302
- Because...
- Excuse me.

15:24.302 --> 15:26.054
Do you even have a name, new guy?

15:26.054 --> 15:27.764
Yeah, "Fuck You" is her name.

15:27.764 --> 15:30.016
Hey, stupid name for a person.

15:30.016 --> 15:32.102
You know my name is Archie.

15:38.900 --> 15:39.860
It's done!

15:40.277 --> 15:45.157
Maybe next time he'll think twice about
not doing his fucking--

15:49.786 --> 15:51.747
Fuck off, twats!

15:52.664 --> 15:54.416
Leave me alone.

15:54.416 --> 15:59.504
I'm already gone.
You're born alone, you die alone.

16:00.130 --> 16:04.509
You're born alone, you die alone.

16:06.136 --> 16:08.722
Yeah, he's definitely
more disturbed than any of us.

16:08.722 --> 16:11.057
You're born alone, die alone...

16:11.057 --> 16:13.143
Rabbit's delicious, hon.

16:13.727 --> 16:15.520
So tender.

16:15.520 --> 16:17.564
So glad you love it, my darling.

16:18.690 --> 16:23.403
And I got the gift you left me
in my glass, earlier.

16:24.321 --> 16:26.114
How's the rabbit, guys?

16:26.114 --> 16:27.616
It's lovely.

16:28.325 --> 16:29.701
I can barely taste the shit.

16:30.494 --> 16:34.706
I can tell this rabbit was actually
quite intelligent, huh?

16:37.417 --> 16:38.418
From the texture.

16:40.420 --> 16:43.965
So, Stede,
what's it like being back at sea?

16:43.965 --> 16:47.886
It's really nice. Yeah. I missed it.

16:47.886 --> 16:51.306
Yeah, you must have.
'Cause you left your wife twice.

16:54.017 --> 16:55.227
Wait, what?

16:58.855 --> 17:01.149
You left me for Mary.

17:01.149 --> 17:03.652
Look, I was going to tell you. It's just--

17:04.694 --> 17:06.988
- Ed.
- One second.

17:19.960 --> 17:21.962
I told you in confidence.

17:25.173 --> 17:26.383
Ed?

17:27.884 --> 17:29.094
Ed.

17:30.429 --> 17:32.431
Can I please explain?

17:33.306 --> 17:35.100
Please, take the blanket off.

17:35.100 --> 17:36.726
Fuck off. Go away.

17:36.726 --> 17:39.271
You can't blame me for not telling you
about Mary.

17:39.271 --> 17:41.565
Yes, I can. I'm blaming you right now.

17:41.565 --> 17:43.358
- I'm blaming the fuck outta you.
- Well, it's not fair.

17:43.358 --> 17:45.026
You hardly gave me a chance
to say anything.

17:45.026 --> 17:47.446
Fair?
Know what's not fair?

17:47.446 --> 17:49.948
You ditching me without a note
or anything,

17:49.948 --> 17:52.367
then expecting me to just melt back
into your arms

17:52.367 --> 17:54.327
soon as you pop your fuckin' head up.

17:54.327 --> 17:55.620
I never expected that.

17:56.413 --> 17:58.206
I never expected a headbutt either,
but I received one.

17:58.206 --> 17:59.541
God. Yeah, throw that back

17:59.541 --> 18:01.001
- in my face now, too.
- I will actually

18:01.001 --> 18:02.544
- because it bloody well hurt!
- Nice. Nice one. Good!

18:02.544 --> 18:04.755
I'm glad it fuckin' hurt!
It was supposed to hurt!

18:04.755 --> 18:06.465
That's the point of headbutts!

18:06.465 --> 18:09.968
- Alright.
- I'm such a fuckin' idiot.

18:11.386 --> 18:12.512
I trusted you.

18:13.513 --> 18:15.307
I trusted us.

18:15.307 --> 18:17.976
But I was just a whim.
Yeah, just a whim to you.

18:17.976 --> 18:22.397
Another plaything like your fancy toy
unicorn boat and your wife.

18:22.397 --> 18:25.525
I was a whim to you. Yeah.

18:25.525 --> 18:27.569
You were gonna burn my face off, remember?

18:27.569 --> 18:30.614
I got over that pretty quick, didn't I?

18:37.079 --> 18:38.872
We were moving so fast.

18:39.623 --> 18:41.750
We're both whim-proned.

18:41.750 --> 18:45.212
And two people prone to whims
shouldn't just run off to China.

18:46.505 --> 18:48.340
I was all in, mate.

18:49.382 --> 18:50.592
I was all in.

18:52.010 --> 18:53.512
I panicked.

18:54.262 --> 18:56.973
Then you shaved your beard off, for me.

18:56.973 --> 18:59.267
Again with the beard.

18:59.267 --> 19:02.312
I'm sorry if my horrible,
naked chin disgusts you

19:02.312 --> 19:04.189
- so much.
- I love your chin.

19:04.189 --> 19:05.524
Naked or otherwise.

19:07.776 --> 19:08.777
- Ed.
- Don't.

19:09.986 --> 19:11.947
- I love--
- No, don't.

19:11.947 --> 19:14.032
You don't get to say that to me.

19:15.283 --> 19:17.911
I love everything about you.

19:19.579 --> 19:21.540
You don't have to say it back to me.

19:23.625 --> 19:25.252
I'm not about to.

19:31.216 --> 19:33.218
I love being near you.

19:34.136 --> 19:37.139
It's nice. It feels good.

19:38.557 --> 19:40.767
Breathing the same air.

19:46.648 --> 19:48.233
"Breathing the same--"

19:48.233 --> 19:52.237
Oh, my God, it was so fucking earnest.

19:53.822 --> 19:56.283
It worked.
Have you guys even had sex yet?

19:56.283 --> 19:58.326
- That is private.
- That's none of your business.

19:58.326 --> 20:01.830
- I called it! I fucking called it!
- You fucking called it!

20:01.830 --> 20:03.331
You've not even given each other a handy?

20:03.331 --> 20:04.416
- A little tickle?
- Excuse me.

20:04.416 --> 20:05.709
- Our private lives are our private lives.
- What are you talking about?

20:05.709 --> 20:07.085
I'll tell you what, though, Ed.

20:07.085 --> 20:09.880
I think he might like the ladies
'cause he gave me a proper tonguing

20:09.880 --> 20:11.131
in the kitchen.

20:11.131 --> 20:14.217
No, she kissed me
right before she threw up.

20:14.217 --> 20:16.178
- You bloody devil.
- I know.

20:16.178 --> 20:18.722
- I'm sorry, love.
- I know exactly what's happening here.

20:19.222 --> 20:21.600
I know what's goin' on. It's a game.

20:21.600 --> 20:26.063
This is just a sick game for them,
and now we're part of it.

20:26.063 --> 20:28.899
I would've expected as much
from Anne here, who's a fucking psycho!

20:28.899 --> 20:30.150
- Hey!
- Come on!

20:30.150 --> 20:31.610
- Ya steal people's faces.
- That's right.

20:31.610 --> 20:35.697
And you, Mary,
what the fuck happened to you?

20:35.697 --> 20:41.286
We moved to a swamp to sell
fucking antiques to fuckin' no one.

20:41.286 --> 20:43.246
We get our fun where we can!

20:43.246 --> 20:44.331
What?

20:44.873 --> 20:46.666
We can leave any time.

20:46.666 --> 20:49.920
It's you who is scared that you're too old
to go back to pirating.

20:49.920 --> 20:51.880
- I never fuckin' said--
- Yes, she did!

20:51.880 --> 20:54.758
- Bitch!
- Don't you say that fucking word!

20:54.758 --> 20:56.802
Bitch, please.
Why don't you go and dust

20:56.802 --> 20:58.011
some end tables or something?

21:07.604 --> 21:09.981
Been wanting to do that for fuckin' years.

21:09.981 --> 21:12.818
- Nice. Really healthy.
- Well done, Mary.

21:12.818 --> 21:15.070
I bet Anne really loved
that ugly piece of shit clock.

21:16.363 --> 21:18.323
Are you a united front now?

21:18.323 --> 21:20.367
You lightweights.

21:21.076 --> 21:24.371
You fuckin' 14-year-old boys.

21:25.330 --> 21:30.710
Me and Annie, we're what
an adult relationship looks like.

21:31.336 --> 21:33.338
Adult? The fuck you talkin' about?

21:33.338 --> 21:35.382
Really? I mean, she stabbed you,

21:35.382 --> 21:38.009
you poisoned her,
and then she jumped on my face.

21:38.009 --> 21:39.845
Just you watch.

21:39.845 --> 21:42.013
You're hot for each other now,

21:42.013 --> 21:46.810
but eventually, your charms'll lose impact
and become annoyances.

21:46.810 --> 21:51.606
The mystery? Gone.
The magic? In the wind.

21:51.606 --> 21:55.736
Fun and games are all that's left.

21:55.736 --> 22:01.450
The only distraction to the last unknown
in your relationship:

22:01.450 --> 22:04.286
which of you will slump over first?

22:07.831 --> 22:10.292
There. I torched it all.

22:11.251 --> 22:12.085
We're free.

22:12.085 --> 22:13.879
You didn't.

22:13.879 --> 22:17.340
Even the little posh tables
and that big cupboard thingy?

22:17.340 --> 22:18.759
Yeah, the armoire.

22:19.551 --> 22:21.553
Everything must go.

22:25.974 --> 22:30.353
You are so fucking hot right now.

22:30.353 --> 22:31.354
I know.

22:31.730 --> 22:33.440
Yeah. Your house is on fire!

22:37.903 --> 22:41.615
- Oh, shit. Come on.
- See you, guys.

22:41.615 --> 22:43.867
- Hold it.
- I am holding it.

22:43.867 --> 22:46.578
Sorry, and twist it a bit, please?

22:47.370 --> 22:49.372
Yeah, that's the one.

22:50.373 --> 22:53.460
- Yeah, yeah.
- Alright.

22:53.460 --> 22:54.753
Well, that's quite lovely, innit?

22:54.753 --> 22:58.048
Yeah. Gold paint's a nice touch.
I thought it'd be overkill, but.

22:58.632 --> 22:59.800
Yeah, but will it be load-bearing?

22:59.800 --> 23:01.968
'Cause that would be embarrassin'.

23:04.763 --> 23:06.556
And you? What's your excuse?

23:06.556 --> 23:08.809
I mean, what even are you?

23:09.643 --> 23:10.894
Fuck off.

23:13.230 --> 23:14.356
Fuck off!

23:15.148 --> 23:17.567
You are harassing a cripple!

23:18.026 --> 23:20.320
Fucking twats!

23:46.471 --> 23:48.682
Fucking cocksuckers.

23:53.645 --> 23:58.275
Goddess, devour me.
Balmy water. Balmy water.

23:58.275 --> 24:00.944
Slick my bones. Spoiled boiled eggs.

24:03.572 --> 24:05.532
Lotta your friends are troubled,
aren't they?

24:05.532 --> 24:09.035
Yeah. Ya know, they're all pirates.

24:09.536 --> 24:10.495
True.

24:12.873 --> 24:15.167
What are you gonna do tonight?

24:15.167 --> 24:17.836
Tonight? I don't know.
I was gonna stay with them,

24:17.836 --> 24:19.129
but I don't know.

24:19.129 --> 24:21.923
Maybe I'll just crash
in the trees or somethin'.

24:21.923 --> 24:23.717
Well, I was thinking if you wanted to,

24:23.717 --> 24:25.385
- I mean, I could ask--
- Well, no, you shouldn't have to--

24:25.385 --> 24:26.636
- Sorry, you go.
- Oh, no, you go. No, sorry.

24:26.636 --> 24:29.014
- Nah, you. No, you.
- Okay.

24:29.014 --> 24:31.892
I was just gonna say
I could put it to the crew

24:31.892 --> 24:34.561
and if you wanted to stay
one more night on the ship,

24:34.561 --> 24:38.065
ya know, extenuating
circumstances and all that.

24:38.065 --> 24:39.816
- Yes.
- What's that?

24:39.816 --> 24:41.693
It might be nice.

24:42.027 --> 24:43.028
Great!

24:45.072 --> 24:48.366
- Yeah.
- I mean, yeah. Wait there.

24:58.126 --> 25:00.504
- The sea is my love.
- Jesus Christ.

25:00.504 --> 25:02.506
You're still here. I forgot about you.

25:02.506 --> 25:06.593
But there is a cruel limit
to the passion I can share

25:06.593 --> 25:08.887
with Her Majesty in this current form.

25:09.346 --> 25:12.641
No offense, man, but I just need you
to not be weird right now.

25:12.641 --> 25:16.144
To love the sea as she must be loved,

25:16.144 --> 25:17.813
requires change.

25:17.813 --> 25:18.939
Oh, my God.

25:18.939 --> 25:21.608
That's what I learned

25:21.608 --> 25:27.239
down in the old gravy basket.

25:28.073 --> 25:29.783
Here, hold that.

25:52.889 --> 25:58.645
Earth, wind, and fire,
reassemble upon Her Majesty.

25:58.895 --> 26:04.109
I wanna go higher.

26:05.485 --> 26:06.486
Okay.

26:10.365 --> 26:14.786
Buttons, people don't change,
not into birds or otherwise.

26:17.289 --> 26:18.457
Buttons?

26:18.957 --> 26:20.792
Buttons? Hey.

26:21.209 --> 26:24.421
Enough fuckin' around, mate.
You're not a fucking bird.

26:36.224 --> 26:38.351
Fuck yeah, brother.

26:39.060 --> 26:40.395
Fly.

26:42.397 --> 26:43.315
Ed.

26:43.648 --> 26:46.151
Hey, can you come with?

26:46.151 --> 26:48.528
It's getting a bit dark,
and I can't, actually,

26:48.528 --> 26:50.405
I can't find my way back to the ship.

26:50.405 --> 26:53.658
Oh, yeah. Yeah, comin'.

26:55.827 --> 26:58.121
Hey! Buttons turned into a seagull!

26:58.121 --> 27:00.791
- What?
- Yeah, he flew off.

28:55.781 --> 28:58.241
I won't be eatin' this way
when I'm a bird.

28:58.241 --> 29:00.452
- You won't, will you?
- No.

29:00.827 --> 29:02.287
Pescatarian, he calls it.

29:04.539 --> 29:05.749
So, there's another Mary?

29:07.334 --> 29:08.585
You ask me,

29:08.585 --> 29:11.671
it's like a non-stop
knockin' shop on that ship.
