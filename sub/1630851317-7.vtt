WEBVTT

00:01.392 --> 00:03.699
<i>Previously on
Bob Hearts Abishola...</i>

00:03.742 --> 00:05.005
<i>So this is what we do.</i>

00:05.048 --> 00:06.528
Chukwuemeka and I get back together.

00:06.571 --> 00:08.399
And you have your happy son.

00:08.443 --> 00:10.880
- So happy.
- Mm. Then,

00:10.923 --> 00:12.882
you and I will meet a series
of women

00:12.925 --> 00:16.103
to see who is fit
to bear your grandchildren.

00:18.018 --> 00:20.194
I can find no fault
with this arrangement.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.326
Kemi,

00:22.370 --> 00:23.849
we have chosen Morenike.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.373
You are a sweet girl.

00:25.416 --> 00:26.809
You came here to study.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.071
Do not jeopardize that.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.899
- What do you mean?
- This whole

00:29.942 --> 00:32.075
Chukwuemeka situation is
a lot more complicated

00:32.119 --> 00:33.642
than they're telling you.

00:33.685 --> 00:36.079
I just came to
pick up a few things.

00:36.123 --> 00:38.908
Two Clif Bars

00:38.951 --> 00:41.389
and strawberry-flavored
lubricant?

00:41.432 --> 00:43.260
There was a sale on Clif Bars.

00:43.304 --> 00:44.740
What is going on?

00:44.783 --> 00:47.786
You are starting
a new life, and so am I.

00:47.830 --> 00:49.223
Hello, everybody.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.441
Hello, Kemi.

00:50.485 --> 00:51.790
This is Terrence.

00:51.834 --> 00:52.922
We work together
at the hospital.

00:52.965 --> 00:54.358
How you doing?

00:54.402 --> 00:55.664
Like your aftershave.

00:55.707 --> 00:56.839
Smells like
strawberries.

01:02.018 --> 01:04.020
Morning, morning,
morning!

01:04.064 --> 01:06.631
Working, working, working.

01:06.675 --> 01:08.894
Look at this from Chukwuemeka.

01:08.938 --> 01:12.811
This is his 16th text
this morning.

01:12.855 --> 01:14.509
He also left four voice mails

01:14.552 --> 01:17.947
in which you could tell
he had been crying.

01:17.990 --> 01:19.122
Poor Chukwuemeka.

01:19.166 --> 01:20.123
I know.

01:21.733 --> 01:23.953
Look. This one was
from his mother.

01:24.867 --> 01:27.522
Whoa. You
got her in all caps.

01:27.565 --> 01:30.655
- And she spelled "foul" wrong.
- Mm-hmm.

01:30.699 --> 01:33.180
How embarrassing.

01:33.223 --> 01:35.356
Hmm. Terrence.

01:38.098 --> 01:40.056
Wait. Terrence

01:40.100 --> 01:41.710
- from radiology?
- Yes.

01:41.753 --> 01:43.755
I dipped my pen in company ink.

01:43.799 --> 01:47.759
Well, technically,
his pen in my ink. Ooh.

01:47.803 --> 01:49.892
But I have hit it,

01:49.935 --> 01:52.721
and now I will quit it.

01:54.766 --> 01:57.117
Hmm. Morenike.

01:58.727 --> 02:00.816
Hmm. The pretty girl
is desperate.

02:00.859 --> 02:02.426
♪ Block!

02:02.470 --> 02:05.647
You cannot get rid of me
that easy, Auntie.

02:06.604 --> 02:08.563
Ten bucks on
the little one.

02:08.606 --> 02:10.347
I will get my purse.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.461
I thought it would be better

02:37.505 --> 02:39.550
if we spoke privately
in my office.

02:40.551 --> 02:42.031
Please,

02:42.074 --> 02:43.511
pull up a tub of pickles.

02:49.256 --> 02:51.780
Chukwuemeka is devastated
by your display at church.

02:51.823 --> 02:53.912
Which I'm sure
was your intention.

02:53.956 --> 02:55.479
It was.

02:55.523 --> 02:57.699
And what is your plan now?

02:57.742 --> 02:59.701
That he and I live
happily ever after

02:59.744 --> 03:01.703
and you go away.

03:01.746 --> 03:03.879
Take a pickle for the road.

03:03.922 --> 03:06.011
I am not going to do that.

03:06.055 --> 03:08.100
You don't like pickles?

03:08.144 --> 03:10.233
If you succeed in
getting rid of me,

03:10.277 --> 03:12.192
do you really think
that will be the end of it?

03:12.235 --> 03:13.976
- Yes.
- So,

03:14.019 --> 03:15.630
Chukwuemeka and his mother
will suddenly

03:15.673 --> 03:17.675
<i>not</i> want him to have children?

03:18.676 --> 03:20.809
Yes.

03:20.852 --> 03:23.942
Auntie, this will
always be a problem.

03:23.986 --> 03:25.335
Unless you
find someone

03:25.379 --> 03:26.771
who will marry him,

03:26.815 --> 03:28.643
provide him
with children,

03:28.686 --> 03:31.602
and is still okay with him
having his Kemi on the side.

03:31.646 --> 03:32.951
And that person is you?

03:32.995 --> 03:34.083
Yes.

03:34.126 --> 03:35.693
Why would you agree to this?

03:35.737 --> 03:37.129
Because my parents
will not be satisfied

03:37.173 --> 03:38.609
until I am married
with children.

03:41.438 --> 03:43.397
But men do not interest me.

03:43.440 --> 03:47.531
I also find them boring,
but what are you going to do?

03:47.575 --> 03:51.274
Nothing... until I met you.

03:51.318 --> 03:53.233
Then I realized

03:53.276 --> 03:56.279
I could marry a man who gets
his companionship elsewhere.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.499
Hmm. You are only saying that
because you have yet

03:58.542 --> 04:03.286
to experience Chukwuemeka's <i>
companionship.</i>

04:03.330 --> 04:06.594
Again,
that does not interest me.

04:06.637 --> 04:09.031
Wait until you see him rise
out of the bathtub

04:09.074 --> 04:11.555
like a sudsy phoenix.

04:11.599 --> 04:14.558
I am not tempted by his bubbles.

04:14.602 --> 04:16.299
- Because he's not your type?
- Yes.

04:16.343 --> 04:17.996
- Because he is bald?
- Because he is a man.

04:18.040 --> 04:19.520
- A tall man?
- Auntie.

04:20.564 --> 04:22.044
I like women.

04:22.087 --> 04:24.742
And apparently,
short, hairy men.

04:28.920 --> 04:30.879
And Friday is a federal holiday,

04:30.922 --> 04:33.490
which means, legally,
we cannot force people

04:33.534 --> 04:36.885
to work, but I have other ways.

04:36.928 --> 04:39.148
Just give the guys the day off.

04:39.191 --> 04:42.325
Do not worry. They cannot
trace this back to you.

04:42.369 --> 04:45.459
Listen to me, Goodwin.
No one's coming in on Friday.

04:45.502 --> 04:47.591
That you know of.

04:47.635 --> 04:50.115
All right, if there's nothing
else, let's have a good day.

04:50.159 --> 04:51.943
Oh, uh, actually,
I-I have something.

04:51.987 --> 04:53.815
Ugh.
Mom.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.730
Sorry. Continue.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.732
I would like to discuss

04:57.775 --> 05:00.517
increasing our social media
presence for the company.

05:00.561 --> 05:01.736
Ugh.

05:02.911 --> 05:05.000
- See? It just comes out.
- Yeah.

05:06.218 --> 05:08.220
Research shows
that brand characters

05:08.264 --> 05:12.007
on social media are as effective
today as Tony The Tiger

05:12.050 --> 05:14.662
or the Pillsbury Doughboy
were on television.

05:14.705 --> 05:15.967
I loved that Doughboy.

05:16.011 --> 05:18.361
Hee-hee-hee-hee-hee!

05:18.405 --> 05:20.581
Well, then you are
gonna love this guy.

05:20.624 --> 05:23.366
Meet Max.
He's an irreverent,

05:23.410 --> 05:25.107
straight-shooting
compression sock

05:25.150 --> 05:26.543
who loves nothing more than

05:26.587 --> 05:29.416
to roast our competition
on Twitter.

05:29.459 --> 05:32.462
Hey, Sock Depot,
you're cutting your prices?

05:32.506 --> 05:34.029
Try cutting your inventory,

05:34.072 --> 05:35.987
'cause it's trash.

05:38.990 --> 05:41.079
Ah.

05:41.123 --> 05:46.215
Christina, our customers
aren't exactly Internet savvy.

05:46.258 --> 05:47.869
That is our demo.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.871
Hey, I know the Internet.

05:49.914 --> 05:52.874
Wait. Is Facebook Internet?

05:52.917 --> 05:55.659
That idea is like a foot
in the other brands' sock.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.226
It stinks.

05:59.315 --> 06:00.577
Very clever, Mr. Wheeler.

06:00.621 --> 06:02.013
Nice shirt, Goodwin.

06:02.057 --> 06:03.841
I heard of casual
Fridays, but not

06:03.885 --> 06:05.843
"What the hell are you
wearing Wednesdays."

06:06.888 --> 06:08.629
- I will change my shirt.
- No.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.979
No, it's just
part of the bit.

06:11.022 --> 06:14.199
Ah. Very clever, Mr. Wheeler.

06:14.243 --> 06:16.680
A compression sock
with attitude.

06:16.724 --> 06:19.074
Now, <i>that's</i> an idea
that would work.

06:19.117 --> 06:20.771
That's exactly what I said.

06:20.815 --> 06:23.252
Honey, it can't always be
about you.

06:23.295 --> 06:26.037
Now support your brother's
- nice idea.
- Yeah.

06:26.081 --> 06:27.909
Listen to that looney broad.

06:35.917 --> 06:37.397
Hello.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.094
Oh, hey, Kofo. Mm.

06:39.137 --> 06:40.356
You were brilliant in there.

06:40.400 --> 06:42.793
Where?

06:42.837 --> 06:45.361
In the meeting.
Your sassy sock idea.

06:45.405 --> 06:47.494
Oh, yeah, it was all right.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.452
Bob made it better.

06:49.496 --> 06:51.106
All he did was pull
a sock off your hand

06:51.149 --> 06:52.586
and put it on his own.

06:52.629 --> 06:54.718
Yeah, but his hand is bigger,

06:54.762 --> 06:57.721
so his sock demanded
more respect.

06:57.765 --> 06:59.767
Christina, your
hand was perfect,

06:59.810 --> 07:02.160
and your idea was perfect.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.207
Christina?

07:05.250 --> 07:07.688
Sorry.

07:07.731 --> 07:09.167
I am not used
to being validated,

07:09.211 --> 07:10.473
so my brain just had to reboot.

07:11.692 --> 07:13.737
Mine does that
at the store

07:13.781 --> 07:16.436
when they ask me,
"Paper or plastic?"

07:16.479 --> 07:19.700
Do not let your family
treat you like that.

07:19.743 --> 07:23.312
I too have been marginalized
by a cousin I work with.

07:23.355 --> 07:24.792
Oh. Goodwin?

07:24.835 --> 07:26.707
I would rather not say.

07:26.750 --> 07:28.491
Eventually I learned,

07:28.535 --> 07:31.189
nothing would change unless
I stood up for myself.

07:31.233 --> 07:35.629
Yeah, well, that takes
a very brave person.

07:35.672 --> 07:37.674
You can be just as brave.

07:42.679 --> 07:43.985
Oh, my.

07:50.078 --> 07:51.645
Look at her Facebook page.

07:51.688 --> 07:53.647
Not one picture with a boy.

07:53.690 --> 07:55.866
Because Morenike is a good girl.

07:55.910 --> 07:59.957
Or she's good <i>with</i> girls.

08:00.001 --> 08:03.178
How could she be gay?
She's Nigerian.

08:03.221 --> 08:05.702
I don't think you understand
how serious this is.

08:05.746 --> 08:07.878
In Nigeria, it is illegal.

08:07.922 --> 08:10.141
Oh, I see. It's outlawed.

08:10.185 --> 08:12.013
That means it
doesn't exist.

08:12.056 --> 08:14.581
- Exactly.
- Well, I have

08:14.624 --> 08:16.887
certainly never met
a gay Nigerian.

08:16.931 --> 08:20.021
Because if anybody knew,
they'd be arrested.

08:20.064 --> 08:23.590
Look, let's say for a minute,

08:23.633 --> 08:25.330
you were gay in Nigeria.

08:25.374 --> 08:27.071
But I'm not.

08:27.115 --> 08:29.117
Hypothetically,
what would you do?

08:29.160 --> 08:32.555
I would flee the country
to avoid prison, obviously.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.339
You still need to hide it
from your family,

08:34.383 --> 08:36.254
or you will be disowned.

08:36.298 --> 08:39.867
So maybe as a cover, you'd
agree to a sham marriage

08:39.910 --> 08:42.217
to a bald pharmacist
with a horrible mother

08:42.260 --> 08:44.393
and a crazy girlfriend.

08:44.436 --> 08:46.003
That could work.

08:46.047 --> 08:47.614
There you go.

08:47.657 --> 08:49.311
There what goes?

08:49.354 --> 08:51.966
Really? She's gay!

08:56.666 --> 08:59.147
Max is trolling
Dr. Scholl's.

08:59.190 --> 09:01.323
- Ew. What is that?
- I said

09:01.366 --> 09:03.847
Dr. Scholl's is diagnosing
skin conditions,

09:03.891 --> 09:06.850
and now everybody's sending him
pictures of their rashes.

09:06.894 --> 09:09.636
Ugh. That's disgusting.
Scroll down.

09:09.679 --> 09:12.203
Have Max say you can get high
smoking their insoles.

09:12.247 --> 09:13.814
Is that true?

09:13.857 --> 09:17.252
Who cares?
It's all about the clicks, baby.

09:19.297 --> 09:21.561
Good. You're all here.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.608
May I address the family?

09:25.652 --> 09:27.131
- Ugh.
- Douglas.

09:27.175 --> 09:30.178
What? I was looking
at the rashes.

09:30.221 --> 09:31.832
I just wanted
to let you all know

09:31.875 --> 09:34.051
that I'm not going
to be here tomorrow.

09:34.095 --> 09:35.575
Another one
of your mental health days?

09:35.618 --> 09:38.273
'‘Cause they're not
helping, honey.

09:38.316 --> 09:40.405
I am taking the day

09:40.449 --> 09:42.625
to explore new
employment opportunities

09:42.669 --> 09:44.932
outside of MaxDot.

09:45.889 --> 09:48.109
I feel
I am underappreciated here

09:48.152 --> 09:49.632
and would like to find

09:49.676 --> 09:51.895
a place that...

09:51.939 --> 09:54.637
values me.

09:55.682 --> 10:00.817
Honey, you are very important
to this company.

10:00.861 --> 10:02.819
You're an essential part
of this team.

10:02.863 --> 10:04.429
You do so much for us.

10:04.473 --> 10:06.083
Like what?

10:06.127 --> 10:07.694
Huh?

10:07.737 --> 10:09.913
What do I do
for the company, Bob?

10:09.957 --> 10:10.871
Lots.

10:11.611 --> 10:12.612
Right, Mom?

10:12.655 --> 10:14.048
She asked you.

10:14.091 --> 10:15.615
Douglas?

10:15.658 --> 10:17.617
I have no idea.

10:17.660 --> 10:21.142
This is great feedback. Thanks.

10:21.185 --> 10:22.578
Come on.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.232
What do you really want here?

10:24.275 --> 10:26.277
To be seen and heard.

10:26.321 --> 10:28.584
I can't do that.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.673
But I can do a new title.

10:30.717 --> 10:33.241
Mom, you can't just
throw money at this problem.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.635
I didn't say money.
I said title.

10:40.248 --> 10:42.032
<i>E kaale.</i>

10:42.076 --> 10:44.861
-<i>E kaale, Abishola.
- We are about
to take a pound cake</i>

10:44.905 --> 10:46.384
to the new tenant in 206.

10:46.428 --> 10:48.691
Do you remember what
I always told you?

10:48.735 --> 10:50.911
Ugh. Be nice to the
neighbors when they move in,

10:50.954 --> 10:53.609
and they will supply you
with gossip for many years.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.394
If we feed him enough cake,

10:56.438 --> 10:59.049
he will sing like a chubby bird.

11:01.486 --> 11:03.663
May I get you some tea, Auntie?

11:03.706 --> 11:05.708
Ah. No, thank you.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.189
Um, please, sit with me.

11:09.364 --> 11:12.367
Auntie Olu told me you
joined the church choir.

11:12.410 --> 11:16.240
Oh, yes. The pastor said I sang
"Joyful, Joyful" so well,

11:16.284 --> 11:17.720
he wept into his stew.

11:17.764 --> 11:19.809
Oh. That's wonderful.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.811
You know, it's important
to have the support

11:21.855 --> 11:24.422
of the community when you
- first move to this country.
- Yes.

11:24.466 --> 11:26.163
I am so thankful for it.

11:26.207 --> 11:28.688
Then you should
be very careful.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.298
Regarding?

11:30.341 --> 11:33.040
I know you are...

11:33.083 --> 11:35.172
gay.

11:36.521 --> 11:38.741
Don't worry. I will
not tell anyone.

11:38.785 --> 11:41.222
- I would appreciate that.
- Mm-hmm.

11:41.265 --> 11:44.312
I think you are smart with this
whole Chukwuemeka arrangement.

11:44.355 --> 11:46.357
It is the best way
to protect yourself.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.142
Yes, Auntie.

11:48.185 --> 11:51.754
Ah. You know how traditional
Nigerians can be.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.800
It is better to
keep it secret.

11:53.843 --> 11:56.324
You think it is best
I stay in the closet?

11:56.367 --> 11:58.326
Closets are very safe places.

11:58.369 --> 12:00.807
It is where I would hide
if there was an intruder

12:00.850 --> 12:03.723
or-or a tornado.

12:03.766 --> 12:06.682
- Yes, Auntie.
- Mm.

12:06.726 --> 12:07.770
You remember Uncle Mobo?

12:07.814 --> 12:09.685
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm. At first,

12:09.729 --> 12:11.556
people suspected
he was like you.

12:11.600 --> 12:14.864
Then he got married, and
all the rumors stopped.

12:14.908 --> 12:18.694
Soon, he had a good job
and six wonderful children.

12:18.738 --> 12:20.696
- Was he happy?
- Who knows?

12:20.740 --> 12:22.959
Every time I saw
him, he was drunk.

12:23.003 --> 12:27.398
But he was a well-respected
family man.

12:27.442 --> 12:29.966
And that is what
is important.

12:30.010 --> 12:32.186
- Yes, Auntie.
- Mm.

12:32.229 --> 12:34.492
So, how is school going?

12:34.536 --> 12:37.147
I got a "B" in chemistry.

12:38.583 --> 12:41.369
Maybe that should also
stay in the closet.

12:52.859 --> 12:55.035
It is so nice
to have everyone here together.

12:55.078 --> 12:57.254
Is it?
I still do not understand

12:57.298 --> 12:59.996
why <i>she</i> needs
to be a part of this.

13:00.040 --> 13:01.737
It's not important
that you understand.

13:01.781 --> 13:04.609
It's important
that I am a part of this.

13:05.872 --> 13:07.264
I would like to make a toast.

13:07.308 --> 13:10.311
To my Mumzy Wumzy.

13:10.354 --> 13:12.966
To my Kemi Bear.

13:13.880 --> 13:15.098
And to...

13:15.925 --> 13:17.231
...you.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.623
Morenike.

13:18.667 --> 13:20.190
I know.

13:20.234 --> 13:22.627
Thanks to you,
I will soon have

13:22.671 --> 13:24.804
more grandchildren
than my sister.

13:24.847 --> 13:26.022
How many does she have?

13:26.066 --> 13:27.241
Only seven.

13:27.284 --> 13:29.417
Only.

13:29.460 --> 13:30.853
Oh. Okay.

13:30.897 --> 13:33.247
Eh. Cheers.

13:33.290 --> 13:34.857
Cheers.
I pray

13:34.901 --> 13:36.772
that the children have
your beautiful hair.

13:36.816 --> 13:39.775
And my son's
perfect cheekbones.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.864
And my eyes.

13:41.908 --> 13:43.344
I do not think
that is possible.

13:43.387 --> 13:45.259
You never know.

13:45.302 --> 13:47.348
Maybe I could stare at your
belly while you are pregnant.

13:47.391 --> 13:49.045
- Huh.
I will name

13:49.089 --> 13:51.134
the firstborn, obviously.

13:51.178 --> 13:53.528
If it is a boy, Chidi.

13:53.571 --> 13:54.616
Hmm.

13:54.659 --> 13:56.357
If it is a girl, Ngozi.

13:56.400 --> 13:59.534
I've always
liked Connor.

14:00.665 --> 14:03.886
Chidi Connor Chukwuemeka.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.409
- It has a nice ring.
- Mm.

14:05.453 --> 14:07.150
What do you
think, Morenike?

14:09.979 --> 14:11.415
I cannot do this.

14:12.460 --> 14:15.071
Well... it doesn't
have to be Connor!

14:15.115 --> 14:18.292
I also like Chad!

14:22.078 --> 14:23.950
What exactly did you say to her?

14:23.993 --> 14:25.560
Huh. The truth.

14:25.603 --> 14:27.867
That if she wants
to be happy, she should

14:27.910 --> 14:29.781
never let anyone
find out who she is.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.479
That is excellent advice.

14:31.522 --> 14:33.873
Why would she not
listen to that?

14:33.916 --> 14:35.918
Hi, Kemi.
Can I offer you a drink?

14:35.962 --> 14:37.920
Can you not see we are talking?

14:37.964 --> 14:42.098
But, yes, a mochaccino with
almond milk and a little nutmeg.

14:42.142 --> 14:43.143
Really?

14:43.186 --> 14:44.057
Yes, really.

14:45.058 --> 14:47.103
Without Morenike,

14:47.147 --> 14:48.670
I will have
to do the impossible

14:48.713 --> 14:50.498
and find another
Nigerian lesbian.

14:50.541 --> 14:53.153
Ugh. And they do
not grow on trees.

14:53.196 --> 14:56.156
What's this now?
Morenike's gay?

14:56.199 --> 14:58.419
Focus on my coffee, Bob.

14:58.462 --> 15:00.595
Hang on. I mean, if she's gay,

15:00.638 --> 15:02.902
why was she involved
with Chukwuemeka at all?

15:02.945 --> 15:04.555
To make her
family happy.

15:04.599 --> 15:05.774
And more importantly,

15:05.817 --> 15:07.515
me happy.

15:07.558 --> 15:08.995
If you ask me,
if she doesn't want

15:09.038 --> 15:10.561
to get married,
that's her choice.

15:10.605 --> 15:13.521
No one's asking you
for anything but coffee.

15:13.564 --> 15:15.958
I'm just saying,
you got divorced,

15:16.002 --> 15:18.134
you married a white
American dude.

15:18.178 --> 15:20.310
You didn't play
by anyone else's rules.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.008
You were true
to yourself, always.

15:22.051 --> 15:23.835
This situation
is different, Bob.

15:23.879 --> 15:25.315
What about you?

15:25.359 --> 15:28.362
You date who you want,
you say what you think,

15:28.405 --> 15:29.711
you show up at somebody's house

15:29.754 --> 15:31.365
demanding a mocha-freakin'-ccino.

15:31.408 --> 15:35.064
Which, clearly,
I will never get.

15:35.108 --> 15:36.587
You're both strong women

15:36.631 --> 15:38.154
who live your lives
on your own terms.

15:38.198 --> 15:40.243
Now, if you can do it,
why not Morenike?

15:40.287 --> 15:42.985
Because she's a Nigerian gay.

15:43.029 --> 15:45.161
- And she's the only one.
Oh, come on.

15:45.205 --> 15:46.206
That can't be...

15:46.249 --> 15:48.338
She's the only one!

15:57.782 --> 15:59.523
What the hell is that?

15:59.567 --> 16:00.916
My resignation letter.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.439
You want to talk about it?

16:02.483 --> 16:04.615
God, no. That's why
I wrote you the letter.

16:07.575 --> 16:09.577
Come in here.

16:09.620 --> 16:12.319
God. Can we not make
a big thing out of this?

16:12.362 --> 16:15.931
It is a big thing. You're
quitting the family business.

16:15.975 --> 16:21.023
No, I am exploring new
and exciting opportunities.

16:21.067 --> 16:22.198
What opportunities?

16:22.242 --> 16:24.635
I don't know yet.

16:24.679 --> 16:26.768
But I know they are new
and exciting.

16:26.811 --> 16:30.685
Well, maybe just stay on
until you figure it out.

16:30.728 --> 16:32.992
Let's be honest.

16:33.035 --> 16:35.559
I don't think
I'll ever figure it out.

16:35.603 --> 16:40.434
And if I don't leave now,
I-I don't think I ever will.

16:41.435 --> 16:43.437
Well...

16:43.480 --> 16:45.569
then you got to go.

16:45.613 --> 16:48.790
You're accepting
my letter of resignation?

16:48.833 --> 16:52.228
No. I'm accepting your

16:52.272 --> 16:55.405
"exploration of new
and exciting opportunities."

16:55.449 --> 16:57.364
Thanks, Bob.

17:01.281 --> 17:03.065
This feels good.

17:03.109 --> 17:04.936
And really, really scary.

17:04.980 --> 17:06.547
You're gonna do great.

17:06.590 --> 17:08.549
Thanks.

17:08.592 --> 17:10.899
I'm gonna go tell Mom.

17:10.942 --> 17:12.988
Okay.

17:20.256 --> 17:23.607
Are you insane?!
You'll die out there!

17:33.922 --> 17:35.706
Hello, Morenike. <i>Kaasan.</i>

17:35.750 --> 17:37.230
Hello, Aunties.

17:37.273 --> 17:39.232
I threatened you.

17:39.275 --> 17:41.843
- What?
- This is your cover story.

17:41.886 --> 17:45.107
I threatened you, and this is
why you left our arrangement.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.109
There were no other
personal reasons.

17:47.153 --> 17:51.026
No need to mention
your... lesbian-ity.

17:51.070 --> 17:54.725
Although, it is your life,
and if you feel like you must...

17:54.769 --> 17:55.987
I am not ready for that.

17:56.031 --> 17:57.989
Oh, thank God.

17:58.033 --> 18:00.992
Whatever happens,
we are on your side.

18:01.036 --> 18:02.516
Even if we do not
understand it.

18:02.559 --> 18:06.215
Which we don't
and never will.

18:07.216 --> 18:09.697
Thank you, Aunties.

18:15.485 --> 18:18.184
I mean, I know
how it works.

18:18.227 --> 18:20.186
I went to an
all-girls school.

18:20.229 --> 18:23.058
After lights out, we
would fumble in the dark.

18:23.102 --> 18:25.060
- Kemi!
- Relax!

18:25.104 --> 18:27.541
We were preparing
ourselves for men.

18:33.416 --> 18:34.896
<i>I don't know if you guys know</i>

18:34.939 --> 18:36.115
what's been going on.

18:36.158 --> 18:37.507
Christina has left,

18:37.551 --> 18:38.552
and her position has

18:38.595 --> 18:40.031
become available.

18:40.075 --> 18:42.077
We all got her beautiful
resignation letter.

18:42.121 --> 18:44.210
Several people
were inconsolable.

18:44.253 --> 18:45.472
Just one people.

18:45.515 --> 18:47.691
Of course,

18:47.735 --> 18:50.477
now you will need to replace
her with someone qualified,

18:50.520 --> 18:53.610
who has great knowledge of
the workings of the company.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.003
That's exactly right.

18:55.046 --> 18:56.700
I usually am.

18:56.744 --> 18:58.180
Congratulations, Kofo.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.355
Excuse me?

18:59.399 --> 19:01.227
Mr. Wheeler, you said "Kofo."

19:01.270 --> 19:03.751
My name is Goodwin.

19:03.794 --> 19:08.059
I know, but Kofo came up
with the outlet store idea.

19:08.103 --> 19:10.236
Plus, he worked with
Christina rebranding

19:10.279 --> 19:13.543
our socks, and she left him
a glowing recommendation.

19:13.587 --> 19:15.545
That was very lovely of her.

19:15.589 --> 19:17.156
You want Kofo?

19:17.199 --> 19:19.419
The Kofo that sleeps
in my garage?

19:19.462 --> 19:21.464
Yes, Goodwin.

19:21.508 --> 19:24.075
We need you down on the floor.
You're our guy.

19:24.119 --> 19:25.686
Your floor guy.

19:25.729 --> 19:26.817
Exactly.

19:26.861 --> 19:28.428
And Kofo is your

19:28.471 --> 19:30.299
office-with-a-view-
of-the-parking-lot guy?

19:30.343 --> 19:32.693
You can also see
the Petco.

19:34.085 --> 19:38.133
Well, there is nothing
for me to say, but

19:38.177 --> 19:41.441
congratulations,
and I quit.

19:41.484 --> 19:42.964
Goodwin, wait.

19:43.007 --> 19:45.227
Good luck.

19:45.271 --> 19:46.750
Now I feel terrible.

19:46.794 --> 19:48.448
I do, too.

19:48.491 --> 19:51.494
Thank you so much
for this opportunity.

19:56.847 --> 19:58.849
I have reconsidered.

19:58.893 --> 20:02.070
I just remember, I have a child
in private school.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.593
Welcome back, Cousin.
