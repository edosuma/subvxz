WEBVTT

00:16.891 --> 00:18.893
I barely knew those guys.

00:19.561 --> 00:21.813
I saw them once a week, tops.

00:22.772 --> 00:25.108
[Evans]
How often did Marty interact with them?

00:25.191 --> 00:26.401
Don't answer that.

00:26.484 --> 00:29.529
If you have questions for Marty Byrde,
you can ask him this afternoon.

00:29.612 --> 00:31.698
Keep in mind, we're here voluntarily.

00:32.449 --> 00:34.159
What about Frank Cosgrove Jr.?

00:34.743 --> 00:37.454
I imagine you dealt with him
with some regularity.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.957
Is there any animosity between you two?

00:41.499 --> 00:42.333
No.

00:43.334 --> 00:45.211
We don't work together that much.

00:45.336 --> 00:46.880
[Maya] Well, that's not true, is it?

00:46.963 --> 00:48.798
I see you two on the casino floor
all the time.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.133
You don't seem too friendly.

00:51.718 --> 00:54.512
We coordinate deliveries for the casino.

00:54.804 --> 00:55.680
That's all.

00:55.847 --> 00:56.973
[Evans] If that's the case,

00:57.057 --> 01:01.478
maybe you can explain why we found
the truck 100 miles across the state

01:01.561 --> 01:03.938
when it was scheduled
to be at the casino this morning.

01:05.440 --> 01:08.943
You'll have to ask Frank Jr.
That's his department.

01:12.322 --> 01:15.283
Is this Frank Jr.'s department, too?

01:25.376 --> 01:27.003
I can't speak to that.

01:28.088 --> 01:31.007
Because it points to the fact
that the KC mob

01:31.091 --> 01:33.885
moves cartel money for Byrde Enterprises?

01:34.385 --> 01:36.596
Because I can't speak to that.

01:36.930 --> 01:39.808
Like I said, you're gonna have to ask him.

01:40.016 --> 01:41.518
[Evans] I'm gonna level with you here.

01:42.310 --> 01:45.313
We've uncovered more
about your boss's operation

01:45.396 --> 01:47.023
in the past six hours

01:47.107 --> 01:49.400
than we have in the past six months.

01:50.735 --> 01:53.988
Now, imagine how far we'll get
by the end of the week.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.991
[ambulance siren wailing]

01:59.410 --> 02:01.287
[siren continues wailing]

02:12.423 --> 02:14.509
[siren fading]

02:18.304 --> 02:20.557
You wanna tell me what the fuck
is going on here, Marty?

02:20.640 --> 02:22.350
I was as blindsided as you, Frank.

02:22.642 --> 02:23.893
So what the fuck?

02:23.977 --> 02:27.605
My boss is in a war with
the Lagunas drug cartel. This was payback.

02:28.314 --> 02:31.734
Are you saying we've been walking around
all this time with targets on our backs?

02:31.818 --> 02:34.654
No, I'm not saying that at all.
This stuff never crosses the border.

02:35.029 --> 02:36.739
Yeah, well, this one fucking did.

02:37.699 --> 02:39.826
You're pissed. I understand.
You got every right to be.

02:39.909 --> 02:40.994
-Pissed?
-Yep.

02:41.327 --> 02:45.039
Three of my men were killed.
Three. I got raided by the feds,

02:45.123 --> 02:47.041
and my son is getting pulled in
for questioning.

02:47.167 --> 02:50.628
Do you have any idea the amount of shit
that you have landed me in?

02:50.712 --> 02:52.589
You know, you're not the only one
that got hit today.

02:52.672 --> 02:55.300
Are you trying to compare
losing $20 million

02:55.425 --> 02:57.468
-with losing three men?
-It's not nothing.

02:57.552 --> 02:59.637
Are you out of your fucking mind?

02:59.721 --> 03:01.848
I watched those boys grow up.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.392
Their families are calling me nonstop.

03:04.475 --> 03:06.477
-What the hell am I supposed to tell them?
-The truth.

03:06.561 --> 03:09.022
Tell them you're as upset as they are,
but cooler heads, Frank.

03:09.105 --> 03:10.899
Only way we're gonna
get through this intact.

03:10.982 --> 03:12.192
And this girl of yours,

03:12.317 --> 03:14.319
how the fuck did she
come out of this alive?

03:14.819 --> 03:16.821
She saw them roll up on your men,

03:16.905 --> 03:18.781
and she tried to alert them,
and it was too late.

03:18.865 --> 03:21.784
[laughs] And this cartel,
they're just gonna let her slip away?

03:21.868 --> 03:24.412
Don't-- Don't go there, Frank.
There's nothing there.

03:24.495 --> 03:26.497
Now listen, I don't like this
any more than you do.

03:26.623 --> 03:29.542
Let's just keep our heads down.
We let the feds do their job, okay?

03:29.626 --> 03:31.920
And then, you know, I know more,
you'll know more.

03:32.879 --> 03:35.048
I am not a patient man, Marty.

03:36.382 --> 03:38.968
-Get your fucking house in order.
-[engine starts]

03:39.385 --> 03:41.137
[tires squealing]

03:49.646 --> 03:50.980
[Charlotte] Holy shit!

03:51.064 --> 03:52.273
[taps keyboard]

03:54.442 --> 03:55.568
Are you okay?

03:57.070 --> 03:57.987
Yeah.

04:00.406 --> 04:01.449
Is that weird?

04:04.035 --> 04:05.620
I don't even know anymore.

04:08.581 --> 04:09.832
Have you talked to Erin?

04:09.916 --> 04:11.376
No, she won't text me back.

04:11.668 --> 04:13.169
She must be freaking out.

04:15.213 --> 04:17.423
Nothing like this
has ever happened to her before.

04:18.549 --> 04:20.301
Have you shown this to Mom and Dad?

04:21.302 --> 04:24.222
I-- I promised Ben
that I wouldn't tell them we were there.

04:24.305 --> 04:25.223
[Charlotte sighs]

04:25.306 --> 04:26.975
I don't want him to get in trouble.

04:32.063 --> 04:33.731
You think I should say something?

04:34.565 --> 04:38.361
No, it'll just give them something else
to fight about.

04:57.255 --> 04:59.257
Answer's the same as it was
five minutes ago.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.259
She's been in there for hours.

05:01.342 --> 05:03.094
You don't say.

05:03.886 --> 05:06.764
Can you at least check to see
what's going on?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.182
Nope.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.356
[Ben sighs]

05:20.695 --> 05:22.280
[Evans] What kind of car do you drive?

05:22.739 --> 05:23.865
A Ford Sport Trac.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.369
We found these at the scene.

05:29.912 --> 05:31.080
Off-terrain,

05:31.539 --> 05:33.082
custom upgrade.

05:33.166 --> 05:34.792
Now, if we impounded your car,

05:34.876 --> 05:37.754
what are the chances
your tire tracks would be a match?

05:37.879 --> 05:40.423
If a set of tire tracks
is your smoking gun,

05:40.506 --> 05:43.259
you better get ready to bring in
the whole damn county for questioning.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.053
[Evans]
I think you were there this morning.

05:45.219 --> 05:47.263
It's your name on the manifests.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.640
The tire tracks place you at the scene.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.727
Now, once we start putting
the pieces together,

05:52.935 --> 05:56.439
you think Marty and this cartel lawyer
are going to stand by your side?

05:57.106 --> 05:57.982
I wasn't there.

05:58.066 --> 05:59.859
Why are you protecting him?

06:00.693 --> 06:02.737
I bet he didn't think twice
about killing your father.

06:02.820 --> 06:04.906
-Okay, we're done here.
-No, I'll answer it.

06:07.575 --> 06:10.661
My daddy was in prison
for most of my life.

06:11.245 --> 06:13.998
I hoped things would change
when he got out.

06:14.999 --> 06:16.626
But he just...

06:17.001 --> 06:19.170
picked up right where he left off.

06:20.546 --> 06:25.635
I think there was plenty of people
who wanted him dead.

06:27.136 --> 06:29.263
You know, Sheriff Nix told me

06:29.931 --> 06:32.767
you never once followed up with him

06:32.850 --> 06:35.561
on the status of the murder investigation.

06:37.772 --> 06:40.691
A daughter who doesn't want to know
who killed her father.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.861
[scoffs] That strikes me as odd.

06:47.323 --> 06:51.369
You don't know a fucking thing
about me and my daddy.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.454
-Okay, let's go.
-[Evans] First, your uncles turn up dead,

06:53.538 --> 06:55.164
then your father gets gunned down.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.749
Now, either you're cursed,

06:56.833 --> 06:59.544
or this is the cost of loyalty
to Marty Byrde.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.717
I'll drop you off at home,

07:06.801 --> 07:09.470
grab some supplies, pack up the truck,
and we'll drive north.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.222
No, I can't go anywhere.

07:11.305 --> 07:12.723
-Yes, you can.
-No, I can't.

07:12.807 --> 07:16.519
If I left now, it'd be a huge red flag
to the FBI, and they'd come after us.

07:16.727 --> 07:19.230
-All the more reason to get a head start.
<i>-</i>You're not listening!

07:19.313 --> 07:21.482
I can't just pick up and leave.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.826
[sighs]

07:47.258 --> 07:48.384
Are you okay?

07:51.220 --> 07:52.221
I'm fine.

07:53.514 --> 07:54.432
Why?

07:56.058 --> 07:58.060
You just seem out of sorts.

07:58.853 --> 07:59.854
That's all.

08:11.741 --> 08:13.618
What the fuck did my sister say?

08:15.036 --> 08:16.829
She's just looking out for you.

08:16.913 --> 08:18.748
Yeah. Which part did she lead with?

08:18.831 --> 08:20.082
The part about me being bipolar

08:20.166 --> 08:22.126
or the part about how
you shouldn't be seeing me?

08:23.127 --> 08:25.379
She said you stopped taking
your medication.

08:26.172 --> 08:27.173
Should I be worried?

08:27.256 --> 08:29.675
She left when she was 18.

08:31.427 --> 08:34.305
She has no actual idea. [breath trembling]

08:36.807 --> 08:38.851
Seriously. [sniffles]

08:44.732 --> 08:47.109
I've spent most of my life off my meds.

08:51.280 --> 08:52.281
[sighs]

08:56.244 --> 08:57.578
It's just me here.

08:59.747 --> 09:01.499
You gotta trust me, okay?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.379
Okay.

09:14.929 --> 09:18.266
They took off from a private airfield
shortly after the attack.

09:18.516 --> 09:19.559
They're no longer a threat.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.561
You said that this morning.

09:22.311 --> 09:24.564
The Lagunas cartel did
what they came to do.

09:26.941 --> 09:30.736
Besides, this place is crawling with feds.
Trust me, they're not sticking around.

09:31.445 --> 09:35.032
And Agent Maya, well, she didn't seem
particularly in our pocket.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.869
-I'm working on that.
-[Helen] I suggest you work faster.

09:38.953 --> 09:40.663
[door opens]

09:41.998 --> 09:44.292
Hey. How's Ruth doing?

09:44.792 --> 09:46.210
How do you think she's doing?

09:53.426 --> 09:56.095
[cell phone ringing]

09:59.348 --> 10:00.641
Hmm.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.565
If it's important, he'll call back.

10:08.357 --> 10:10.109
[vibrating]

10:18.326 --> 10:19.327
[Helen] Helen Pierce.

10:21.495 --> 10:22.496
She's right here.

10:23.539 --> 10:24.624
It's for you.

10:32.798 --> 10:33.633
Yes.

10:34.508 --> 10:35.885
Why didn't you pick up?

10:36.844 --> 10:38.429
Because it is not a good time.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.349
<i>That's exactly why I'm calling.</i>

10:42.391 --> 10:44.894
What do you plan on doing
with the FBI situation?

10:46.646 --> 10:49.565
<i>You're worried I'm still upset about</i>
<i>what happened at the horse farm.</i>

10:52.610 --> 10:53.653
Are you?

10:54.028 --> 10:54.987
<i>No.</i>

10:55.071 --> 10:57.823
But you should know the harm
that this does to our reputation.

10:58.407 --> 11:00.409
<i>Marty and I are the brand.</i>

11:02.745 --> 11:03.913
The brand.

11:04.872 --> 11:06.040
<i>That's right.</i>

11:06.582 --> 11:10.336
We're your shield, and that shield
is your only chance at legitimacy.

11:10.419 --> 11:13.130
It is our ability to get those casinos.

11:13.214 --> 11:16.509
It is our standing in the community,
it is our political contacts.

11:16.592 --> 11:21.097
We've even started a charitable foundation
to expand our legitimate footprint.

11:21.931 --> 11:25.726
<i>If our brand gets damaged,</i>
<i>so does your safety net.</i>

11:28.020 --> 11:29.980
You think I need you for protection?

11:32.400 --> 11:35.569
I think you understand
that a person in your position

11:36.237 --> 11:38.239
who gets this much notoriety...

11:38.864 --> 11:41.242
invites intervention
from the US government.

11:43.327 --> 11:44.412
<i>You've been smart.</i>

11:45.037 --> 11:47.707
<i>You've kept a lower profile</i>
<i>than your rivals.</i>

11:48.624 --> 11:52.002
And your investment in us
is an extension of that.

11:57.508 --> 11:58.843
Next time I call...

12:00.511 --> 12:01.470
pick up.

12:12.648 --> 12:13.858
[engine cuts off]

12:14.358 --> 12:15.943
[car door whirs open]

12:25.244 --> 12:26.203
Who's that?

12:26.287 --> 12:27.246
[Marty] Hey, Sue.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.081
That's our therapist.

12:29.457 --> 12:31.834
-Marty.
-What are you doing here?

12:31.917 --> 12:34.962
I wanted to make sure you were okay.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.089
Well, that's a hell of a car for a shrink.

12:37.173 --> 12:40.176
I heard about that truck assault

12:40.259 --> 12:41.594
-on the radio.
-Okay.

12:41.677 --> 12:44.221
-They're saying it was mob-related...
-Yeah, it's not a good time.

12:44.305 --> 12:47.224
-...but it feels more like cartel to me.
-You're gonna have to go, okay?

12:47.308 --> 12:49.935
You can tell me. Was this us?

12:51.729 --> 12:53.606
There is no us. What's this?

12:54.148 --> 12:55.357
It's a car.

12:55.816 --> 12:58.736
It's a Transformer, and I spoke to you
about conspicuous spending.

12:58.819 --> 13:01.322
-Send this back.
-Now, see, Marty,

13:01.405 --> 13:03.199
that's your problem.

13:03.741 --> 13:07.161
You are always trying
to control everything.

13:07.244 --> 13:08.329
-Got it.
-Loosen up,

13:08.412 --> 13:10.414
put a little sparkle in your step.

13:10.498 --> 13:12.833
-Please get back in the toy and leave.
-Now, listen,

13:12.917 --> 13:17.004
I think we experienced a real breakthrough
in our last session.

13:18.380 --> 13:20.257
I don't. I'm kicked out of the house.

13:20.341 --> 13:23.844
That just means
we're going somewhere good.

13:23.928 --> 13:25.638
-Well, disagree.
-[Wendy] Hey, Sue.

13:26.514 --> 13:27.515
Everything okay?

13:27.640 --> 13:30.309
Uh, she came by to check on us,
but leaving now.

13:30.392 --> 13:33.354
[chuckles] Good to see you, Wendy!

13:33.562 --> 13:36.398
-Trust the process.
-Okay, bye.

13:37.817 --> 13:39.652
Agent Evans is expecting us.

13:41.946 --> 13:42.863
[car door shuts]

13:42.947 --> 13:45.658
[engine starts, revving loudly]

13:45.741 --> 13:48.244
[engine sputters, clicks]

13:49.995 --> 13:52.289
-[revving]
-[tires screech]

13:52.414 --> 13:55.084
I thought you said Ruth did okay
with the FBI.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.336
Doesn't matter.
They could still come after her.

13:57.461 --> 14:00.172
I'm probably on their radar, too,
and it's not just them to worry about.

14:00.256 --> 14:02.049
If you witness something like this
in Mexico,

14:02.132 --> 14:03.843
the cartel would execute you on sight.

14:04.343 --> 14:05.886
We need to get off the grid.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.306
Do you guys have any cash on you?

14:09.390 --> 14:11.517
I mean, most of my money is tied up
in cryptocurrency,

14:11.600 --> 14:14.270
but I could leverage my blockchain
to get you a cash loan.

14:14.353 --> 14:16.063
You know what? Don't worry about it.

14:17.523 --> 14:19.525
You need a passport to get into Canada.

14:19.650 --> 14:20.860
Do you have yours?

14:21.235 --> 14:22.361
Shit.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.781
Um... [stammers]
Oh, we to drive to Seattle,

14:25.865 --> 14:27.491
take one of them buses to Vancouver,

14:27.575 --> 14:30.077
-go from there.
-Yeah, but you don't have to run.

14:30.160 --> 14:31.745
I need food for the ride.

14:32.204 --> 14:35.749
Can you pack me something?
Sandwiches, uh, chips, anything?

14:35.833 --> 14:39.253
No one knows we were there, Ben.
There's no one coming after us.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.630
-We're safe.
-Oh, shit!

14:41.714 --> 14:43.340
-What?
-Where's my phone?

14:43.424 --> 14:45.509
Can one of you guys go see
if I left it in the van?

14:45.593 --> 14:48.929
Yeah, sure. Come on, Jonah. Come on.

14:50.764 --> 14:51.891
Tell Mom.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.236
[Marty] Frank.

15:07.323 --> 15:08.949
What the hell was that all about?

15:19.043 --> 15:20.127
Hey.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.963
I hear you're leaving town with Ruth.

15:23.714 --> 15:25.966
-Is that a problem?
-No.

15:26.342 --> 15:28.761
Actually, I think it's really smart.

15:30.179 --> 15:32.014
My one suggestion

15:32.222 --> 15:34.934
is that maybe you leave separately,
so you don't attract attention.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.227
I mean, I can book you a hotel room
wherever you want.

15:37.311 --> 15:39.772
And then once all this stuff
with the FBI dies down,

15:39.855 --> 15:41.982
I'll send Ruth to you. What do you think?

15:45.110 --> 15:46.278
I think you're a liar.

15:47.321 --> 15:49.531
If I leave without Ruth,
you're gonna turn her against me.

15:50.574 --> 15:51.867
Why would I do that?

15:51.951 --> 15:55.371
Same reason you went behind my back
and told her I stopped taking my meds.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.248
She deserved to know.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.835
-Hmm. I was gonna tell her myself.
-Hmm.

16:03.337 --> 16:04.380
I was.

16:05.130 --> 16:06.632
You stole that from me.

16:07.049 --> 16:08.592
You stole that from me.

16:19.436 --> 16:20.729
I'm worried about you.

16:20.813 --> 16:21.730
Don't be.

16:22.022 --> 16:24.733
Jonah told me you took him
to the money drop this morning.

16:25.192 --> 16:27.236
I was trying to protect Ruth.

16:27.820 --> 16:31.156
She would be dead right now
if it wasn't for me.

16:31.240 --> 16:34.034
You put my son in danger.

16:34.785 --> 16:36.787
I put your son in danger?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.835
Jonah and I just witnessed a massacre.

16:43.335 --> 16:45.212
How are we all not leaving right now?

16:45.796 --> 16:48.549
How is that boy walking around
like there's nothing wrong?

16:48.632 --> 16:51.135
How are you sitting here
and acting like this is all normal?

16:51.218 --> 16:53.762
I don't want you under my roof
if you're not gonna take your medication.

16:53.846 --> 16:56.098
Fine. Then I will not be under your roof.

17:02.479 --> 17:04.857
[Evans] How well did you know the men
who died in the attack?

17:05.274 --> 17:06.358
Not well at all.

17:06.442 --> 17:09.028
They were arrested with your kids
a few days ago.

17:10.237 --> 17:13.073
You never had a personal interaction
with them?

17:14.033 --> 17:15.659
One, maybe. Two?

17:18.746 --> 17:21.457
[Evans]
They do any work for you, on the side?

17:21.915 --> 17:22.875
No.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.668
You're sure about that answer?

17:25.252 --> 17:26.170
On the record?

17:30.382 --> 17:34.136
This picture's a little blurry,
but I'm sure you recognize him.

17:34.219 --> 17:35.179
Tommy Walsh.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.766
Primary suspect
in the casino arson investigation.

17:39.641 --> 17:41.518
You were working him as a CI?

17:47.441 --> 17:49.359
Is my client a murder suspect?

17:49.818 --> 17:51.070
What are we talking about?

17:51.153 --> 17:53.781
You found out Tommy was working for us

17:53.864 --> 17:57.117
and got your cartel
to solve the problem.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.495
Same MO as Cade Langmore's murder.

17:59.620 --> 18:03.582
Are they accusing me of money laundering
or staging this hit?

18:03.916 --> 18:04.750
[Helen] Both.

18:05.417 --> 18:07.336
You really think I'm capable
of doing that?

18:07.419 --> 18:09.630
[Helen]
Who else have you floated this theory by?

18:10.047 --> 18:11.590
Cosgrove? Frank Jr.?

18:11.673 --> 18:14.802
You know I can't share the details
of an ongoing investigation.

18:16.261 --> 18:18.847
That piece of shit was working our kids
this entire time.

18:18.931 --> 18:21.850
Do you know that he was actually trying
to fuck my teenage daughter?

18:24.353 --> 18:26.355
Could your kids have let anything slip?

18:26.939 --> 18:29.983
No. No, no, no. You know that they--
they know how to be careful.

18:30.067 --> 18:31.276
Fucking FBI.

18:32.319 --> 18:34.780
They're just trying to get the KC mob
to turn on us.

18:34.863 --> 18:36.573
-I know.
-Smoke us out any way they can.

18:36.657 --> 18:38.951
So, get a new phone, call Wendy.

18:39.118 --> 18:41.078
Tell her to sweep the house for bugs.

18:44.706 --> 18:47.334
-[patrons chattering]
-[music playing softly]

18:50.504 --> 18:53.215
Hey. Hey!

18:54.007 --> 18:54.925
What?

18:55.676 --> 18:57.386
You're not gonna fucking get away with it.

18:57.469 --> 18:59.888
-What are you talking about?
-You killed my friend--

18:59.972 --> 19:03.809
Shh! Keep your fucking voice down.

19:03.892 --> 19:05.769
I don't know what you're talking about.

19:05.853 --> 19:09.481
That fed told me that Tommy was a snitch,
and Marty had him killed.

19:10.190 --> 19:11.692
And you set him up.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.570
Wait, what?

19:14.653 --> 19:17.322
You knew. You fucking knew,

19:17.406 --> 19:18.991
so you had them killed.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.827
That's why you switched locations.

19:23.245 --> 19:24.246
Listen to me.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.665
I'm sorry about your friends.

19:26.748 --> 19:29.126
I really am, but I didn't kill them.

19:29.209 --> 19:30.586
I was in charge of them.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.338
You're drunk, and you need to go home.

19:34.339 --> 19:38.051
Do you think I wanted to be here
dealing with you?

19:38.135 --> 19:40.762
My fucking dad giving me
a bullshit babysitting job,

19:40.846 --> 19:42.556
and I can't even keep them safe.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.308
I'm sorry.

19:45.726 --> 19:47.102
Go home.

20:00.449 --> 20:01.992
-[dice land]
-[man] Oh!

20:02.075 --> 20:04.286
-[woman shouts]
-[scattered applause]

20:04.411 --> 20:06.955
-Sam Dermody.
-Yes?

20:07.122 --> 20:08.916
Can I speak with you for a moment?

20:09.416 --> 20:10.334
Sure.

20:11.627 --> 20:12.961
What's this all about? [chuckles]

20:13.795 --> 20:16.965
Math. I'm good at math.

20:17.966 --> 20:19.843
Probabilities, abstractions.

20:20.510 --> 20:25.265
And by my calculation,
you've lost $250,000, give or take.

20:25.432 --> 20:26.433
Yeah, uh...

20:27.059 --> 20:28.894
You're not gonna tell my girlfriend,
are you?

20:29.353 --> 20:30.395
No.

20:30.979 --> 20:35.025
But I am gonna have to re-examine
your financials.

20:35.943 --> 20:39.947
Bank statements, pay stubs,
all that fun stuff.

20:40.614 --> 20:41.865
Wait, you can do that?

20:41.949 --> 20:44.159
If I suspect illegal activity.

20:45.035 --> 20:47.621
Yeah, but I'm not doing anything illegal.
I'm just losing, you know?

20:47.704 --> 20:49.665
Well, then you have nothing
to worry about.

20:51.416 --> 20:54.920
Also, you'll be hearing from the IRS.

21:03.220 --> 21:04.846
[cell phone rings, vibrates]

21:08.225 --> 21:09.226
Oh, fuck.

21:09.810 --> 21:11.436
Sam, what's-- what's up?

21:11.520 --> 21:13.146
Marty, something weird's going on.

21:13.230 --> 21:14.856
An FBI agent just came up to me

21:14.940 --> 21:16.817
and started asking me
for all sorts of records.

21:17.234 --> 21:18.193
<i>What do I do?</i>

21:18.360 --> 21:20.487
Uh, just, uh, just...

21:20.612 --> 21:24.199
um, stop what you're doing
and cash out your chips.

21:24.283 --> 21:26.618
Wait, no, Wendy said that this was okay.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.537
<i>Uh, it is. It's-- It's okay.</i>

21:29.913 --> 21:31.456
Okay, it doesn't feel very okay.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.874
<i>They're just trying to spook you.</i>

21:32.958 --> 21:34.710
These agents, they've got quotas

21:34.793 --> 21:38.380
and low-hanging fruit gets the job done.
Okay?

21:40.507 --> 21:41.758
Am I the fruit, Marty?

21:41.842 --> 21:45.512
Well, um... I mean,
they can't access your records

21:45.595 --> 21:48.181
unless they prove that
you're doing something illegal,

21:48.265 --> 21:50.934
and being a shitty gambler is not a crime.

21:51.018 --> 21:54.104
Yeah, that's what I told her,
but she wasn't taking it for an answer.

21:54.187 --> 21:56.815
Sam, just go home
and we'll sort it out in the morning.

21:59.860 --> 22:00.819
[exhales]

22:02.070 --> 22:03.113
Fuck.

22:18.837 --> 22:20.964
-[Frank Jr.] Hey!
-[Ruth cries out, gasps]

22:21.048 --> 22:23.175
-[Frank Jr. grunting]
-[groaning]

22:27.971 --> 22:29.222
[coughing]

22:32.225 --> 22:35.312
-[Frank Jr.] Fuck you!
-[moaning]

22:35.395 --> 22:36.313
[Frank Jr. pants]

23:02.839 --> 23:03.882
Hey.

23:11.223 --> 23:12.432
I'm sticking around.

23:12.516 --> 23:14.476
Yeah. [sighs]

23:17.479 --> 23:18.563
How's she doing?

23:19.898 --> 23:21.483
She's out of the operating room.

23:21.566 --> 23:23.652
There was internal bleeding,
so they had to operate.

23:26.405 --> 23:27.823
They said you can come back.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.574
I'll let you know how it goes.

23:44.965 --> 23:45.924
[sighs]

23:54.724 --> 23:56.893
I swept the house for bugs. It's clear.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.525
Uh, Helen wants us
to have new phone numbers.

24:03.608 --> 24:05.235
I got you a new SIM card.

24:07.195 --> 24:08.029
[Marty exhales]

24:09.239 --> 24:10.740
How are you? [sighs]

24:11.032 --> 24:14.703
-How am I? I'm tired, what about you?
-Same.

24:15.620 --> 24:19.082
You know, the fucking FBI did that to her.

24:19.166 --> 24:21.251
They pointed Frank Jr. right at her.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.879
Have you talked to Frank Sr.?

24:24.421 --> 24:25.589
It's my next stop.

24:25.964 --> 24:27.132
What about Maya?

24:28.008 --> 24:28.967
-No.
-Progress?

24:29.050 --> 24:30.177
You know, she's...

24:30.677 --> 24:32.387
You know, she's an idealist.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.681
She won't take the payday lender info.

24:35.223 --> 24:38.727
And she wants to do the job, but she's
not willing to bend any rules do it, so.

24:39.561 --> 24:40.479
So?

24:41.730 --> 24:44.608
So, I need a back channel to the FBI.

24:45.567 --> 24:46.485
Um...

24:47.444 --> 24:48.695
Even if she won't take it,

24:48.778 --> 24:51.823
I bet that her bosses won't give two shits
about her principles.

24:51.907 --> 24:54.659
So, if that happens, I'll have an opening.

24:58.246 --> 25:00.624
I might have an end around
that could work.

25:02.334 --> 25:03.668
I'll do it first thing.

25:15.597 --> 25:16.723
[Erin] Thanks.

25:18.266 --> 25:20.769
[inhales, exhales]

25:22.229 --> 25:23.146
[sniffles]

25:28.109 --> 25:30.820
Why is the FBI questioning
Charlotte's dad?

25:32.030 --> 25:34.991
Well, we're just trying to be
as helpful as possible. That's all.

25:38.662 --> 25:39.538
[laughs]

25:43.083 --> 25:46.127
[gasps]
I was with them two days ago, and...

25:47.128 --> 25:49.172
-and now they're dead.
-I know.

25:50.674 --> 25:51.758
[sobs]

25:52.467 --> 25:54.511
-Um...
-[sniffles]

25:54.803 --> 25:57.430
I think it's probably best
if you go back home to Chicago.

26:00.559 --> 26:01.893
So, that's it?

26:02.435 --> 26:05.188
Things get hard
and you just want to pawn me off on Dad?

26:05.272 --> 26:06.690
No. Well...

26:06.940 --> 26:09.859
I thought you'd be happy.
I mean, you can hang with Seth.

26:10.151 --> 26:11.736
Seth's in Summer League.

26:11.820 --> 26:14.072
Dad practically lives at the office.

26:15.115 --> 26:18.660
I'm just gonna get stuck listening
to his girlfriend talk about thigh gaps

26:18.743 --> 26:20.579
and vegan cheese.

26:21.371 --> 26:22.706
[both chuckle]

26:25.917 --> 26:26.835
Um...

26:29.129 --> 26:31.631
Can I-- Can I just stay with you?

26:36.469 --> 26:37.429
[Helen sighs]

26:37.512 --> 26:38.388
[knocks]

26:41.891 --> 26:42.892
[Darlene] Hey, hon.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.687
Is everything all right?

26:47.022 --> 26:48.148
[Three] Is Wyatt around?

26:49.316 --> 26:50.191
Come in.

26:53.820 --> 26:54.654
He's...

26:55.822 --> 26:56.698
[Wyatt] Hey.

26:59.993 --> 27:00.952
[Three clears throat]

27:04.247 --> 27:05.498
Did you get my texts?

27:06.708 --> 27:07.584
Yeah.

27:12.714 --> 27:14.633
Then why didn't you come to the hospital?

27:16.718 --> 27:19.304
[sighs] I just...

27:20.013 --> 27:21.890
didn't think it'd be a good idea.

27:22.265 --> 27:23.725
[Darlene] What's going on?

27:25.018 --> 27:26.353
Ruth's in the hospital.

27:29.439 --> 27:32.359
Are you gonna tell me
what the hell's going on between you guys?

27:35.820 --> 27:37.030
It's complicated.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.491
You know, she's banged up pretty bad.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.619
Broken ribs, internal bleeding.

27:45.413 --> 27:46.873
Thanks for letting me know.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.994
-[engine stops]
-[sighs] He made a mistake.

28:26.913 --> 28:28.581
Is that what you think this is? A mistake?

28:28.665 --> 28:30.917
The kid lost three of his friends.
He wasn't thinking straight.

28:31.000 --> 28:32.711
He's not a fucking kid. He's a grown man.

28:32.794 --> 28:34.671
He beat the shit out of a girl
half his size.

28:34.754 --> 28:38.299
-She's part of my family, you know that?
-Those boys were part of my son's family.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.510
Oh, is that right?
Because one of them was a CI.

28:40.969 --> 28:42.804
You want me to get my fucking house
in order?

28:42.887 --> 28:46.099
If I had known,
I would have handled him myself.

28:46.182 --> 28:48.810
How much did that kid give to the feds?
You have any idea?

28:49.436 --> 28:51.604
Was he wearing a wire?
Was anybody else compromised?

28:51.980 --> 28:53.690
Cooler heads, Marty. Remember?

28:53.773 --> 28:57.444
Fuck that. You can't control your son,
and you didn't know Tommy was a snitch.

28:57.527 --> 28:59.738
You're a fucking liability,
and we're done.

29:00.530 --> 29:02.240
You really want to do this?

29:03.575 --> 29:05.994
You come anywhere near me,
my family or Ruth again,

29:06.077 --> 29:07.287
the next time you see your son,

29:07.370 --> 29:09.748
he's gonna be hanging from a bridge
in Juárez, you got that?

29:11.666 --> 29:13.668
[engine starts]

29:19.632 --> 29:22.469
This must be a stressful time
for you and your husband.

29:23.052 --> 29:25.555
Given that three of your employees died
in that attack.

29:25.638 --> 29:27.766
[stammers] Well, they were contractors.

29:27.932 --> 29:30.226
They were not employees, but...

29:31.728 --> 29:34.189
yes, we're reeling.

29:36.107 --> 29:38.318
Tell me about this charitable foundation
you're starting.

29:39.235 --> 29:40.487
My husband and I,

29:41.529 --> 29:43.990
we want to fund social causes
across the state.

29:44.324 --> 29:46.743
Access to healthcare, education.

29:47.327 --> 29:50.538
And we're--
we're forming an advisory board.

29:52.499 --> 29:55.043
Is that anything you would ever consider?

29:55.710 --> 29:57.128
I'm flattered, but...

29:57.921 --> 29:59.506
given the PR crisis you're facing

29:59.589 --> 30:03.259
and your connection to a die-hard
conservative like Charles Wilkes--

30:03.343 --> 30:05.678
Well, you have every right
to have reservations,

30:05.762 --> 30:08.348
and look, I'm no fan
of Charles' politics, but...

30:09.182 --> 30:10.517
Missouri is tilting red,

30:10.600 --> 30:14.062
and reaching across the aisle,
it's the only way to get anything done.

30:16.898 --> 30:19.526
Your work on "Ban the Box,"

30:20.276 --> 30:22.320
advocating for police reform...

30:25.156 --> 30:27.075
I know ambition when I see it.

30:29.035 --> 30:31.496
What do you have your sights set on?

30:32.330 --> 30:33.456
A congressional seat?

30:34.249 --> 30:35.291
Governorship?

30:37.043 --> 30:38.378
Because what you need...

30:39.212 --> 30:40.839
is political cachet.

30:42.006 --> 30:45.093
Are you familiar with a company
named Blink Check?

30:46.344 --> 30:48.471
They wiped out a lot of families
in this community.

30:48.847 --> 30:51.558
When we were researching loan services
for our casino,

30:52.308 --> 30:54.978
we came across some internal documents

30:55.061 --> 30:56.938
from Blink's CEO.

30:58.815 --> 31:01.359
Cause for another lawsuit
if they ever came to light.

31:06.114 --> 31:07.198
Could be useful.

31:09.200 --> 31:11.119
The publicity certainly wouldn't hurt.

31:15.623 --> 31:17.125
I think I could be of service.

31:18.001 --> 31:18.918
Great.

31:21.921 --> 31:24.507
That is great to hear.<i> </i>[laughs]

31:24.591 --> 31:26.593
[machine beeping]

31:46.112 --> 31:47.363
How's she doing?

31:48.323 --> 31:50.033
Why? So you can interrogate her again?

31:51.451 --> 31:53.995
I need you to be honest with me.

31:54.579 --> 31:57.123
-What happened out there?
-You really think I killed those guys?

31:57.206 --> 31:58.541
I don't know what to think.

31:59.709 --> 32:02.629
My boss just got a file
with the intel you tried to pitch me.

32:02.754 --> 32:04.339
-Hmm.
-What are you doing?

32:04.422 --> 32:06.049
Let me guess.
They want you to re-open the case?

32:06.132 --> 32:07.258
-They do.
-Good.

32:09.636 --> 32:11.804
I think I might have been wrong about you.

32:11.888 --> 32:15.308
No, Agent Evans did this.
You sat there, you listened to his lies,

32:15.391 --> 32:16.935
you didn't lift a finger to stop it.

32:17.018 --> 32:19.520
Might as well have kicked the shit
out of her yourself, you know that?

32:20.438 --> 32:22.899
And now you're going around
intimidating gamblers on my floor?

32:22.982 --> 32:26.402
You want me to be your asset?
You learn how to be a better handler.

32:27.862 --> 32:30.114
Does Sam Dermody know
you're using him to launder money,

32:30.198 --> 32:32.659
or are you taking advantage of him
like everybody else?

32:35.745 --> 32:37.664
Until you're straight with me,

32:38.414 --> 32:40.333
I'm gonna keep coming after you.

32:53.179 --> 32:55.181
[Zeke fussing]

33:19.122 --> 33:22.166
You gonna tell me what happened
between you and Ruth?

33:23.084 --> 33:25.503
And don't tell me it's complicated.

33:26.254 --> 33:28.673
You got more language in you than that.

33:42.812 --> 33:44.022
[punches pillow softly]

33:50.236 --> 33:51.571
She killed my dad...

33:53.531 --> 33:54.949
and my Uncle Boyd.

33:56.576 --> 33:58.953
Electrocuted them
on the dock of the Blue Cat.

34:06.753 --> 34:08.129
[sighs]

34:15.553 --> 34:16.554
Maybe...

34:17.597 --> 34:19.223
she had a good reason.

34:21.392 --> 34:23.436
Did it to protect Marty Byrde.

34:23.519 --> 34:28.024
Oh. If that's the case,
your quarrel is not with your cousin.

34:28.107 --> 34:29.108
It's with Byrde.

34:31.611 --> 34:33.571
That man is a disease.

34:33.988 --> 34:37.075
He worms his way in,
gets his hooks into people

34:37.158 --> 34:39.577
and changes them
so they forget who they are.

34:41.037 --> 34:45.583
I mean, I saw it happen
right in front of me with Jacob.

34:46.834 --> 34:49.003
The man I loved for 40 years,

34:50.046 --> 34:51.047
like a...

34:51.631 --> 34:53.007
a part of me.

34:54.425 --> 34:59.347
I watched him turn into something
that I-- I didn't even recognize.

35:00.515 --> 35:01.766
And he knew it, too.

35:03.601 --> 35:06.479
He just wasn't strong enough
to fight it himself.

35:10.525 --> 35:12.193
And that's why I had to kill him.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.238
What?

35:17.907 --> 35:20.827
-I thought you said he had a heart attack.
-He did.

35:22.328 --> 35:24.580
It just wasn't entirely natural.

35:26.499 --> 35:29.377
Once the Byrdes turned him against me,

35:29.460 --> 35:31.129
it was just a matter of time

35:31.212 --> 35:34.841
before he turned his back
on everything else we built.

35:35.383 --> 35:39.262
I couldn't just stand by and watch that.

35:45.309 --> 35:46.644
You want to leave?

35:49.147 --> 35:52.567
-No, no, it's just a lot.
-I know.

35:53.860 --> 35:56.529
[inhales] Lord knows, I miss him.

35:58.114 --> 36:02.827
But every time I feel a pang of regret,
I remind myself

36:04.328 --> 36:06.539
that the man I loved disappeared

36:06.622 --> 36:10.626
long before I slipped those cherry pits
into his coffee.

36:21.637 --> 36:22.930
The point being,

36:23.514 --> 36:25.183
it's not too late for Ruth.

36:26.142 --> 36:28.352
She can still change her course.

36:33.107 --> 36:34.859
Go and see your cousin.

36:45.286 --> 36:46.537
[turns off engine]

36:50.082 --> 36:51.584
[Sue] <i>So, tell me,</i>

36:51.667 --> 36:55.338
how long have you been
the Byrde family's lawyer?

36:56.130 --> 36:57.340
About a year.

36:57.506 --> 36:59.467
How long have you been their therapist?

36:59.884 --> 37:02.595
Well,
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say.

37:03.137 --> 37:05.598
Patient confidentiality and all.

37:12.104 --> 37:13.439
Six months.

37:14.440 --> 37:15.608
Give or take.

37:17.944 --> 37:18.986
As their lawyer,

37:19.237 --> 37:21.656
it's my job to ensure that
their interests are protected.

37:21.739 --> 37:25.243
So, I would like to discuss
your financial relationship with them.

37:27.119 --> 37:29.372
I'm not sure what you're referring to.

37:29.956 --> 37:31.249
The money for the car.

37:46.889 --> 37:48.641
Before I answer,

37:49.433 --> 37:53.145
is this conversation covered
under attorney-client privilege?

37:53.688 --> 37:54.605
Yes, it is.

37:56.190 --> 37:57.191
Okay.

37:57.817 --> 38:00.569
Are you talking about
the bribes they've been paying me

38:00.653 --> 38:02.488
behind each other's backs

38:02.571 --> 38:05.992
or the lump sum payout
Marty cut me the other day?

38:08.077 --> 38:08.911
Both.

38:09.912 --> 38:13.040
Are you satisfied with the terms
that were established?

38:15.126 --> 38:16.502
You know...

38:17.128 --> 38:21.299
I hate being the squeaky wheel,
but now that you bring it up...

38:22.633 --> 38:26.846
$100,000 seemed like a lot money
at the time,

38:26.929 --> 38:29.807
but with this truck ambush

38:30.224 --> 38:32.476
and some unexpected...

38:32.977 --> 38:36.188
quality of life expenses
that have popped up,

38:37.815 --> 38:39.859
I'm beginning to think

38:40.234 --> 38:43.571
I may have undervalued my services.

38:48.743 --> 38:50.703
I'll make sure you're taken care of.

38:52.204 --> 38:54.040
-[door opens]
-[game music plays]

38:54.832 --> 38:55.708
Hey.

38:57.335 --> 38:58.627
Ruth's vitals are stable.

38:58.711 --> 39:00.629
She's been upgraded to fair condition.

39:00.713 --> 39:03.799
She's still sedated, but Ben said
he'll call me when she wakes up.

39:05.051 --> 39:06.260
How is Ben?

39:08.137 --> 39:09.555
He's doing better.

39:10.931 --> 39:12.308
[vehicle approaching]

39:18.939 --> 39:20.483
Jonah, why don't you go inside?

39:20.566 --> 39:21.859
[Maya] Am I interrupting?

39:23.611 --> 39:25.029
Go ahead. Go.

39:30.868 --> 39:32.119
Can I help you with something?

39:32.453 --> 39:34.747
I am losing patience with your husband.

39:35.623 --> 39:36.791
Get in line.

39:37.375 --> 39:40.044
I appreciate you two
spending some time apart.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.171
And then I thought,

39:42.922 --> 39:45.424
maybe this could offer some perspective
on the situation.

39:45.508 --> 39:46.634
I'm sorry, but...

39:47.385 --> 39:48.552
my kids are home.

39:48.636 --> 39:51.097
-I got a friend in the hospital--
-Right, chase, cutting to.

39:52.640 --> 39:55.309
He's never gonna get a better offer
than 18 months

39:55.893 --> 39:57.853
and a chance to work
with the federal government.

39:57.937 --> 40:00.523
That's some criminal fantasy camp shit
right there.

40:03.192 --> 40:04.902
You do know about the deal, don't you?

40:06.028 --> 40:07.113
We discussed it.

40:08.030 --> 40:10.908
And you know he was about to take it
before he was dragged to Mex--

40:11.700 --> 40:13.160
Kansas City?

40:13.577 --> 40:15.162
-I do.
-So, we're up to speed.

40:15.246 --> 40:16.122
We are.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.749
Which is why I thought

40:19.041 --> 40:22.002
you two spending some time apart
might help the situation.

40:25.214 --> 40:27.425
-You want me to push him to take the deal.
-Push, pull,

40:27.508 --> 40:29.760
I want you to do what's best
for your family.

40:30.594 --> 40:32.346
He's great at what he does.

40:33.222 --> 40:35.891
It's a shame he has to do it
for a shitty boss.

40:39.562 --> 40:40.980
I see why he likes you.

40:43.607 --> 40:44.775
[stammers] So, just...

40:45.609 --> 40:47.278
let me be clear on the details.

40:48.737 --> 40:51.615
If he takes the deal,
he'll be a convicted felon.

40:52.825 --> 40:53.951
-That's right.
-Mm-hmm.

40:55.035 --> 40:58.414
Do you know convicted felons
can't hold a casino license in Missouri?

40:59.874 --> 41:00.916
I do.

41:06.755 --> 41:08.257
Thanks for stopping by.

41:15.431 --> 41:17.433
[soft buzzing]

41:20.728 --> 41:23.856
[machines beep steadily, muted]

41:40.706 --> 41:41.624
Hey.

41:49.882 --> 41:51.759
What... What's going on?

41:52.968 --> 41:55.596
Shh. It's all right, it's all right.

41:56.514 --> 41:59.683
Just relax. You're in the hospital.

42:01.727 --> 42:03.354
You've been out for a day.

42:08.192 --> 42:10.653
They found you in the casino parking lot,

42:11.445 --> 42:12.905
but you're safe now.

42:16.617 --> 42:17.535
You...

42:18.244 --> 42:19.954
You've been here the whole time?

42:22.414 --> 42:24.375
I didn't want you to wake up alone.

42:27.211 --> 42:28.045
[chuckles]

42:33.676 --> 42:35.636
You-- You look like shit.

42:35.803 --> 42:37.805
[both laugh]

42:48.440 --> 42:50.234
Did Frank Jr. do this?

42:54.863 --> 42:55.781
Uh...

42:56.782 --> 42:57.658
I...

42:58.617 --> 43:01.036
I-- I-- I didn't get a good look.

43:07.418 --> 43:08.877
[Ruth exhales]

43:09.336 --> 43:10.588
Did Wyatt come?

43:13.048 --> 43:15.634
No. I'm sorry.

43:38.324 --> 43:40.367
Tell Marty and Wendy that...

43:42.661 --> 43:44.330
that I need to talk to them.

43:46.707 --> 43:47.708
[whispers] Okay.

43:49.710 --> 43:51.712
[doorbell ringing "Joy to the World"]

43:56.508 --> 43:59.261
[Sue] You must be Frank Jackson.

43:59.845 --> 44:01.263
Come in.

44:09.730 --> 44:12.191
So, what brings you here, Frank?

44:12.816 --> 44:13.901
[Nelson sighs]

44:15.444 --> 44:18.155
There's a stray dog
that keeps coming into my yard.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.867
Seems nice enough. Friendly.

44:22.409 --> 44:23.661
Clearly needs a home.

44:24.411 --> 44:25.704
But I don't want it.

44:27.247 --> 44:29.083
Does that mean
there's something wrong with me?

44:29.792 --> 44:31.919
Have you ever had a dog before?

44:33.629 --> 44:34.672
A husky.

44:36.924 --> 44:38.300
He died last year.

44:39.718 --> 44:40.928
Got hit by a car.

44:42.721 --> 44:47.017
Maybe you're scared
that if you take in this stray,

44:47.518 --> 44:50.896
you'll be opening yourself up to hurt.

44:50.979 --> 44:53.399
Do you think you're avoiding pain?

44:55.109 --> 44:55.943
Maybe.

44:58.237 --> 45:00.239
Why do you think that is?

45:02.616 --> 45:03.909
My job, perhaps.

45:05.869 --> 45:07.579
It's better if I don't feel things.

45:09.915 --> 45:11.417
I did love my dog.

45:14.461 --> 45:17.965
It's easy to confuse vulnerability

45:18.048 --> 45:19.550
with weakness.

45:20.342 --> 45:22.803
But allowing yourself to be vulnerable

45:23.512 --> 45:26.265
is the truest sign of strength.

45:28.225 --> 45:29.226
[exhales]

45:30.269 --> 45:31.186
Thank you.

45:32.438 --> 45:33.605
That was very helpful.

45:34.481 --> 45:36.275
[chuckles] Glad to be of service.

45:39.611 --> 45:42.030
If you don't mind me asking,

45:42.114 --> 45:44.491
what is it that you do for a living?

45:55.169 --> 45:56.044
[inhales]

46:02.718 --> 46:05.304

[sighs]

47:07.950 --> 47:09.660
[elevator bell dings]

47:14.414 --> 47:15.999
[Wendy] Could you hold the door, please?

47:18.460 --> 47:19.294
[Marty] Oh.

47:23.715 --> 47:25.050
Good to see you.

47:26.593 --> 47:27.928
Good to see you, too.

47:30.806 --> 47:32.391
I added your name to the card.

47:32.933 --> 47:33.851
Thank you.

47:35.811 --> 47:37.563
Maya came by the house.

47:39.940 --> 47:41.358
She offered you a deal.

47:43.277 --> 47:45.362
I didn't say anything,
'cause I wasn't gonna take it.

47:45.445 --> 47:46.488
[elevator dings]

47:47.656 --> 47:48.907
Yes, you were.

47:57.583 --> 47:58.750
[Wendy] Hey.

48:00.085 --> 48:02.087
Oh, you had us worried.

48:03.297 --> 48:04.464
How are you feeling?

48:05.424 --> 48:09.511
Like somebody took me apart
and put me back together the wrong way.

48:12.139 --> 48:14.224
But the drugs ain't bad. Mmm.

48:18.562 --> 48:20.314
It's really nice to have you back.

48:28.906 --> 48:31.325
You know Frank Jr. did this.

48:31.909 --> 48:33.201
You know that, right?

48:34.536 --> 48:36.705
Yeah. We've, um...

48:37.039 --> 48:39.791
We've, uh, cut ties with the KC mob.

48:39.875 --> 48:42.210
You will never have to work
with them again.

48:45.130 --> 48:46.006
And?

48:47.424 --> 48:48.508
What do you mean?

48:50.510 --> 48:52.679
Frank Jr. crossed a line.

48:54.640 --> 48:56.016
I'm untouchable.

48:57.225 --> 48:58.435
That's what you said.

48:58.518 --> 49:01.146
Why don't we talk about this later?
You've been through a lot--

49:01.229 --> 49:03.774
No! I want you to kill him.

49:04.358 --> 49:05.400
Let's, uh...

49:05.943 --> 49:07.444
Thank you. Um...

49:11.323 --> 49:12.699
That's not possible.

49:14.034 --> 49:17.621
Doesn't really seem like
you're putting it into consideration.

49:19.039 --> 49:20.415
Because it can't happen.

49:20.540 --> 49:22.751
You didn't see the look on his face.

49:22.876 --> 49:26.588
If someone hadn't scared him off,
then he would have killed me.

49:26.672 --> 49:30.133
There's-- There's nothing stopping him
from finishing the job.

49:30.217 --> 49:32.260
I think you're right, Wendy.
We should talk later.

49:32.344 --> 49:36.264
Um, I promise you,
he's never gonna touch you again.

49:36.348 --> 49:37.557
That's not enough.

49:37.641 --> 49:41.603
Ruth, Ruth, what he did was unforgivable,

49:41.687 --> 49:44.106
and we should have done much more
to protect you,

49:44.189 --> 49:47.025
and Frank Jr., he'll have to answer
for his actions, but...

49:47.901 --> 49:50.195
killing him is not a solution.

49:52.072 --> 49:53.615
Of course it is.

49:54.950 --> 49:59.287
Of all people, I don't understand
why the two of you can't see that.

49:59.705 --> 50:03.166
Hey, Ruth, we have cut ties,

50:03.250 --> 50:06.628
and you just have to accept
this is the best version of it.

50:07.045 --> 50:08.296
The best for who?

50:08.839 --> 50:12.009
Stop acting like you made
some huge fucking sacrifice.

50:12.259 --> 50:13.427
Tommy was a rat,

50:13.510 --> 50:16.263
and the FBI knows
they moved money for you.

50:18.432 --> 50:20.475
And you would have cut them loose, anyway.

50:21.351 --> 50:24.187
[stammers]
If Charlotte was lying in this bed,

50:24.271 --> 50:26.314
we wouldn't even
be having this conversation.

50:26.773 --> 50:28.066
-That is not true.
-Come on.

50:28.150 --> 50:29.443
You know we love you.

50:32.738 --> 50:35.032
You killed my dad.

50:37.534 --> 50:40.037
And he barely touched your kid.

50:40.912 --> 50:41.955
And you...

50:42.330 --> 50:43.790
You had him killed.

50:44.416 --> 50:47.836
He did nothing but hurt you
your entire life.

50:57.554 --> 50:58.513
Fine.

51:01.224 --> 51:02.893
Then I'll kill him myself.

51:04.644 --> 51:06.063
-No, you won't.
-[Wendy huffs]

51:06.938 --> 51:09.483
Then fucking do something about it.

51:10.692 --> 51:11.735
We have.

51:13.820 --> 51:14.863
It's done.

51:15.530 --> 51:16.907
This ends right now.

No, not really.

52:57.716 --> 52:58.633
Good.

52:59.843 --> 53:01.261
Keep your schedule open.

-Hell no. You're heavier than you look.
-[both laugh]

-Oh! Stop!

-Okay.

-Okay, wait, wait. Let me down.
-Okay. Shh.

-Okay.

-Yeah.

-Hey.
-Hey.

54:28.056 --> 54:29.557
Who did this, Ruth?

It doesn't matter.

54:41.653 --> 54:44.406
[exhales sharply, grunts]

54:46.700 --> 54:51.997
Look, I'm-- I'm sorry I didn't come
visit you in the hospital. I just...

54:53.248 --> 54:54.874
I figured the Byrdes
were gonna be there

54:54.958 --> 54:57.877
-and I just-- I really didn't--
-It's okay.

55:04.509 --> 55:06.678
When I heard about what happened,
I just...

55:09.973 --> 55:12.976
started thinking about
what it would be like if you were gone,

55:13.059 --> 55:15.645
and it scared the shit out of me.

55:23.445 --> 55:25.238
I think I knew the truth...

55:26.906 --> 55:29.576
way before you said it out loud.

55:32.746 --> 55:36.082
[sighs] Why'd you have to say it out loud?

55:42.088 --> 55:44.090
I wanted you to hear it from me.

55:48.470 --> 55:50.221
I owed you at least that.

56:00.523 --> 56:03.026
[Ruth] When I woke up in the hospital...

56:03.109 --> 56:06.071
-[Wyatt sniffles]
-...there was a... a split-second

56:06.154 --> 56:09.866
where I thought I was in my trailer,

56:10.492 --> 56:13.495
and I could have sworn I heard

56:14.537 --> 56:17.040
Russ and Boyd arguing in the yard.

56:19.834 --> 56:21.461
And I was relieved, 'cause...

56:23.421 --> 56:25.965
for a second, none of it happened.

56:28.426 --> 56:29.761
You didn't hate me.

56:31.346 --> 56:32.514
I was clean.

56:35.517 --> 56:37.268
I should've done better by you.

What do you call it?

56:45.944 --> 56:47.112
The Langmore curse?

56:49.364 --> 56:50.448
No.

56:50.907 --> 56:52.409
I was wrong about that.

56:53.910 --> 56:56.246
[sniffles] Who we are ain't so bad.

57:00.083 --> 57:02.252
It's the Byrdes that cursed everything.

57:03.628 --> 57:07.465
The minute that they showed up,
everything got turned upside down.

57:11.302 --> 57:12.345
I...

57:13.596 --> 57:15.974
I don't know who you are
when you're with them.

57:17.642 --> 57:19.060
I haven't changed.

57:22.981 --> 57:24.232
Yes, you have.

It's okay.

57:33.825 --> 57:34.701
It's fine.
