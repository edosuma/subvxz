01:54.291 --> 01:56.541
Chris.

01:57.208 --> 01:59.708
I'm out of time.

01:59.791 --> 02:03.875
This is gonna be my last message.

02:04.500 --> 02:09.291
You have the package I sent
you and the address to bring it to.

02:10.916 --> 02:18.375
I hope you get this because, the rest is up to you.

02:21.916 --> 02:24.916
Well, everything's ready for your stay.

02:24.958 --> 02:26.416
Where have you traveled from?

02:26.541 --> 02:27.583
Denver.

02:27.625 --> 02:28.874
How was the journey?

02:28.916 --> 02:30.208
Long.

02:30.250 --> 02:33.083
Well, please leave it as you find it and put the keys

02:33.125 --> 02:35.208
in the post box when you go.

02:35.333 --> 02:39.833
My number's in the visitor's book
if you need it but, try not to need it.

02:44.375 --> 02:48.041
Do you get many guests here these days?

02:48.166 --> 02:49.958
Not these days.

05:44.833 --> 05:45.750
Hello?

05:45.916 --> 05:47.458
Where the fuck are you, Chris?

05:47.500 --> 05:49.041
I'm just sorting a few things out.

05:49.208 --> 05:50.541
Where are you?

05:50.583 --> 05:51.749
I'll be back soon.

05:51.791 --> 05:53.166
Karen said your passport is missing.

05:53.208 --> 05:55.416
That's all she knows about where you are.

05:55.458 --> 05:57.458
You've left Karen to just deal with everything and

05:57.500 --> 05:59.666
she's pregnant for God's sake.

05:59.750 --> 06:01.500
I'll be back in a few days.

06:01.625 --> 06:03.583
You're about to have a kid, Chris.

06:03.708 --> 06:05.083
Yeah, a few days.

06:05.125 --> 06:05.958
That's it.

06:06.083 --> 06:07.416
What about the faculty?

06:07.541 --> 06:08.666
The staff don't need babysitting.

06:08.750 --> 06:10.166
That's why I hired them.

06:10.291 --> 06:12.958
I know the news has hit you hard, but Billy was sick.

06:13.083 --> 06:17.625
Growing up in that house, it was
inevitable, but you can't be blamed.

06:17.708 --> 06:20.000
We all stopped listening to his nonsense.

06:20.125 --> 06:22.583
I know you feel guilty that you
weren't there when he did what he did.

06:40.125 --> 06:42.583
Where the fuck are you, Chris?

06:43.291 --> 06:45.000
Chris?

07:17.125 --> 07:21.083
Chris

07:21.500 --> 07:27.666
Thank you, for following the breadcrumbs.

07:29.250 --> 07:35.624
I knew you'd be the one to
find them, and probably the only

07:35.666 --> 07:37.750
one that cared enough to look.

07:40.708 --> 07:44.875
Now, listen to my voice.

07:45.291 --> 07:50.041
My breathing is steady, I sound fully conscious.

07:51.000 --> 07:52.333
I am not

07:52.375 --> 07:54.416
what you all think I am.

07:56.833 --> 07:59.708
Since what happened to me and my team, my rabbit hole

07:59.833 --> 08:02.583
just got a little too deep.

08:04.625 --> 08:07.875
Too deep for those around me to follow.

08:10.250 --> 08:14.958
I know by now you'll have received calls about me.

08:15.625 --> 08:19.666
And I know that you're hoping
what you've been told isn't true.

08:21.625 --> 08:23.583
Especially...

08:25.500 --> 08:28.708
Especially as it's now too late to ask me.

08:31.375 --> 08:33.624
Where all this started,

08:33.666 --> 08:38.666
long before our expedition was a
study on a psychological phenomenon

08:38.707 --> 08:42.875
we called 'The Primordial Fear'.

08:43.416 --> 08:50.291
The realization that the universe
is so vast and so infinite, that you

08:50.333 --> 08:57.583
see how horrifically insignificant
we are in the grand scale of existence.

08:58.250 --> 09:04.999
That inescapable thought becomes
a dangerous obsession for some

09:05.041 --> 09:07.208
mentally vulnerable people.

09:07.291 --> 09:14.250
If you really think on it
being so small, so unimportant.

09:14.708 --> 09:16.916
What would be the point of anything?

09:17.166 --> 09:18.708
Why go to work?

09:18.833 --> 09:20.916
Why procreate?

09:21.041 --> 09:22.833
Why keep in contact with loved ones?

09:22.875 --> 09:26.500
Because it all makes no difference to anything.

09:27.250 --> 09:32.666
That thought literally sends
some people mad, usually leading

09:32.750 --> 09:36.375
to a psych ward or suicide.

09:36.708 --> 09:40.125
Unfortunately, it tends to be the latter.

09:40.458 --> 09:46.041
What this study led to and what
became our focus was a smaller

09:46.083 --> 09:52.541
section of these people who actually
embraced this spiral into madness,

09:52.666 --> 09:55.166
refusing to take their own lives.

09:55.375 --> 10:02.124
We found staggering consistencies
in accounts by people from all walks of

10:02.166 --> 10:04.749
life, in different corners of the globe.

10:04.791 --> 10:10.083
Who all shared the same story,
almost word for word of what they

10:10.166 --> 10:13.250
felt was an inarguable truth.

10:14.000 --> 10:20.541
That, existence is an endless
dream of an ancient deity.

10:20.708 --> 10:23.666
More omnipotent and omnipresent than

10:23.708 --> 10:30.583
Whoever we pray to, who they call 'The Origin'.

10:31.083 --> 10:35.250
Every one of these believers
also asked the same question,

10:35.375 --> 10:38.375
the basis of their belief.

10:39.333 --> 10:42.000
What if this entity awakes?

10:42.625 --> 10:50.625
Would we blink out of existence or would
we join The Origin in its own reality?

10:52.583 --> 10:57.291
Well, that's what these people hope.

10:57.916 --> 11:04.958
They hope to wake this sleeper and put
an end to a universe that ignores them.

11:06.708 --> 11:10.416
No one can be insignificant if no one exists.

11:13.458 --> 11:16.291
I'm leaving you our research into their accounts.

11:16.333 --> 11:20.791
All I want you to do is fact check our findings.

11:20.958 --> 11:25.166
Then if you feel fit to pass it
on to the people who accuse

11:25.208 --> 11:29.500
me of these, things, then.

11:29.750 --> 11:32.166
Then I guess that's up to you.

11:34.791 --> 11:40.500
But if you are here. God, I hope you are.

11:41.125 --> 11:49.125
Then you have the time, to read, to listen, to witness.

11:52.958 --> 11:54.958
If I'm being honest, Chris that's,

11:55.083 --> 12:02.083
that's all I want, uh, a witness
to prove I spent the end of my life

12:02.125 --> 12:06.875
on something tangible, something real.

12:09.541 --> 12:12.916
If you can do this for me, then we're square.

12:13.000 --> 12:17.874
I release you from that guilt
you always felt, even though

12:17.916 --> 12:20.541
none of it was ever your fault.

12:26.833 --> 12:29.083
Do this for me, Chris.

12:31.083 --> 12:32.916
Please.

12:37.791 --> 12:40.625
I don't even know where to start.

12:43.166 --> 12:45.166
Jesus Billy.

12:52.916 --> 12:55.750
What was I thinking?

12:57.708 --> 13:00.958
Gods and followers.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.875
I saw you!

17:14.958 --> 17:16.625
Okay.

17:17.790 --> 17:21.665
Well, that's how it feels to shit yourself.

17:27.250 --> 17:30.208
You couldn't have done it in a beach hut in Hawaii?

17:30.541 --> 17:32.750
You asshole.

17:51.958 --> 17:53.458
Okay.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.166
Okay.

18:37.541 --> 18:45.541
Open the door, light the way

19:06.833 --> 19:08.541
Hello?

19:09.708 --> 19:11.333
Mrs Duffy?

19:11.416 --> 19:12.833
Yes?

19:14.250 --> 19:17.583
It's Chris, Chris Rivers.

19:17.708 --> 19:19.541
I was Billy's friend.

19:19.958 --> 19:21.291
Chris.

19:21.583 --> 19:23.041
Yes Ma'am.

19:23.458 --> 19:25.708
How are you?

19:26.625 --> 19:28.541
I'm okay.

19:28.666 --> 19:29.625
Yeah.

19:30.583 --> 19:35.875
Um, how, how are...

19:37.208 --> 19:45.208
Uh, you know, I heard about Billy
and I know that I should have, uh,

19:48.541 --> 19:49.458
Yeah I'm,

19:49.500 --> 19:51.833
I'm just, I'm so sorry about Billy.

19:51.875 --> 19:53.791
I just wanted to say that.

19:54.041 --> 19:55.916
It's okay.

19:56.750 --> 20:00.250
Hopefully wherever he is, he's found some peace.

20:00.625 --> 20:03.791
Something he didn't have a lot of in his life.

20:04.416 --> 20:07.708
You we're such a brilliant influence.

20:07.875 --> 20:12.749
Coming back to the UK was one of the worst
things we could have done looking back.

20:12.791 --> 20:15.874
No, we, you know, we understood why you left

20:15.916 --> 20:18.166
and we were so proud of you.

20:18.208 --> 20:20.500
It was so brave.

20:21.750 --> 20:23.749
I appreciate that.

20:23.791 --> 20:27.499
But whatever problems his father
was causing, it was unfair to pull William

20:27.541 --> 20:29.624
back and forth across the world.

20:29.666 --> 20:32.125
He was always unsettled.

20:32.666 --> 20:35.458
He just didn't know where home was.

20:35.791 --> 20:38.583
Well, he knew it was with you, Mrs Duffy.

20:40.083 --> 20:42.750
You are a good friend, Chris.

20:44.291 --> 20:49.750
I dunno, I didn't talk to him for over a year.

20:50.208 --> 20:55.375
I mean, I did try once, but I
was, uh, I was always too busy and

20:56.583 --> 20:59.916
He wasn't easy to get a hold of.

21:00.333 --> 21:04.166
And when you did catch him
well, his attention was elsewhere.

21:06.500 --> 21:09.125
Well, that's why I'm calling to be honest.

21:09.250 --> 21:14.874
Um, I'm sorry to drag things up, but I
was wondering if you could tell me what

21:14.916 --> 21:17.833
Billy was up to in the last few months?

21:18.333 --> 21:24.583
You know, what he was doing
and well, why he did what he did.

21:24.750 --> 21:29.500
He had little time for
chit chat, but he seemed focused.

21:29.750 --> 21:33.875
For the first time in a long time
after a project somewhere in...

21:34.125 --> 21:36.083
...Eastern Europe?

21:36.666 --> 21:38.333
Czechoslovakia or...

21:38.708 --> 21:39.624
Serbia or...

21:39.666 --> 21:40.749
Bosnia.

21:40.791 --> 21:42.458
Yes, that's it!

21:42.500 --> 21:45.583
When he came back, he'd become
obsessed with an area of countryside

21:45.625 --> 21:49.458
we used to holiday at in the summer. A cottage in Wales.

21:49.500 --> 21:53.083
He asked me all these questions
about it and the woods nearby.

21:53.125 --> 21:56.750
Endless questions about
those woods he used to play in.

21:56.875 --> 22:00.749
I found out he actually stayed in that
cottage for months, walking across the

22:00.791 --> 22:03.291
moors and into the woods each day.

22:03.875 --> 22:05.874
I thought it was a peaceful way to live.

22:05.916 --> 22:11.124
It seemed positive, unfortunately,
soon after the landlord

22:11.166 --> 22:13.791
found him in the outhouse.

22:20.416 --> 22:22.208
Mrs Duffy?

22:22.416 --> 22:24.333
Yes.

22:25.750 --> 22:27.916
I'm sorry I wasn't there.

22:28.250 --> 22:30.875
Neither of us were sweetheart.

22:31.416 --> 22:34.708
And if we were, I doubt there
would've been much we could do.

22:34.750 --> 22:38.041
I think he made that decision a long time ago.

22:39.250 --> 22:45.249
But, you are going to keep your
head up and if you need anything,

22:45.291 --> 22:47.375
you're going to let me know.

22:47.458 --> 22:48.875
Alright?

22:48.958 --> 22:50.083
Thank you.

22:50.500 --> 22:51.750
I will.

22:52.041 --> 22:53.500
And Chris?

22:53.666 --> 22:55.333
Yes Ma'am.

22:55.583 --> 22:59.208
Look after yourself, please.

23:00.000 --> 23:01.875
Life isn't a rehearsal.

23:02.083 --> 23:03.458
Don't waste it.

23:03.500 --> 23:05.500
Yes Ma'am.

23:05.708 --> 23:08.083
Bye Chris.

23:08.791 --> 23:10.875
Goodbye

24:11.000 --> 24:15.999
We started to focus
all our time searching for signs of these people

24:16.041 --> 24:19.875
who talked about this sleeping deity.

24:20.458 --> 24:27.333
We looked wherever there were reports
of, shall we say, overindulgent murders.

24:27.541 --> 24:32.750
Anything ritualistic with a
tell-tale signature left at the scene.

24:33.125 --> 24:35.500
A circle within a circle.

24:35.916 --> 24:39.666
We found, lots of them.

24:41.041 --> 24:46.666
When caught, these people all
spoke the exact same doctrine.

24:47.000 --> 24:51.333
Endlessly droning about waking the one that sleeps.

24:51.375 --> 24:54.708
They believe by causing so much death,

24:54.958 --> 25:00.916
chaos and fear their ancient God would
notice them, choose them due to the

25:00.958 --> 25:03.708
sheer pleasure that it would feel.

25:03.833 --> 25:08.250
They say it feeds off suffering.

25:08.625 --> 25:13.416
The 'chosen' are apparently sent doorways
of some kind to pass over to the other

25:13.458 --> 25:17.041
side and join the very thing they worship.

25:17.875 --> 25:23.875
Frankly, these discoveries were intoxicating.

25:24.375 --> 25:27.833
Yes, these people are psychologically damaged.

25:28.333 --> 25:33.874
They were already bending in the wind and
'The Primordial Fear' finally broke them.

25:33.916 --> 25:41.291
But, why do dozens of people
thousands of miles away from each other

25:41.333 --> 25:47.416
all quote scripture written about
the same imaginary cosmic being.

25:48.583 --> 25:51.625
We eventually spent all our time tracking them.

25:53.500 --> 25:56.708
If you look through our findings, you'd see that

25:56.875 --> 26:04.875
we'd found sites, caves, sewers,
woods. Out of the way places

26:09.375 --> 26:13.958
to perform their, depravities.

26:14.916 --> 26:20.791
Even here, we found them here.

28:27.166 --> 28:29.750
That's close enough pal.

28:34.875 --> 28:37.208
Call Handler 1: Emergency. Which service?

28:37.250 --> 28:38.291
Police.

28:38.541 --> 28:40.208
Call Handler 2: Police, what is your emergency?

28:40.333 --> 28:43.083
Hello. I'm staying a Bryn Nos
cottage in the valley, and there's a,

28:43.125 --> 28:44.666
there's a man trying to break in.

28:44.791 --> 28:48.624
He broke in last night too and
uh and he, he looks dangerous.

28:48.666 --> 28:50.083
Call Handler 2: Where is this man now?

28:50.125 --> 28:52.333
And he's standing right outside my window.

28:52.375 --> 28:54.541
Call Handler 2: Sir, I need you to stay calm, someone...

28:56.083 --> 28:57.375
Hello?

28:57.458 --> 28:58.708
Hello!

28:58.750 --> 29:01.541
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.

29:23.458 --> 29:27.083
Interview
with Jason Vanderberg, 8th of April, 2019

29:27.125 --> 29:30.124
in Pretoria, South Africa.

29:30.166 --> 29:34.666
Recorded after he murdered his
wife and child. He was the first person

29:34.750 --> 29:38.416
that talked to The Origin that
we were able to meet face to face.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.958
The interview resulted in the
death of my associate Gurdeep Singh.

29:45.875 --> 29:49.208
Are you burdened with religion Mr Duffy?

29:50.916 --> 29:53.583
Sunday School, as a child.

29:55.291 --> 29:57.583
I tried to be a believer.

29:57.625 --> 30:00.208
Every Sunday I sat there and listened.

30:00.375 --> 30:06.416
Something to help me find courage
in the torment, that consumes me.

30:06.875 --> 30:10.250
Do you know why he doesn't answer our prayers Mr Duffy?

30:10.791 --> 30:11.958
He's scared.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.333
Terrified.

30:13.916 --> 30:17.041
Of waking something far older than him.

30:17.541 --> 30:22.083
He knows that by helping us, IT would notice him.

30:22.416 --> 30:27.000
You see, your God is a fucking coward.

30:27.458 --> 30:29.625
IT answers me when I call.

30:29.708 --> 30:34.249
IT listens, it tells me when it wakes.

30:34.291 --> 30:40.000
I will be rewarded for my devotion
and when it makes this world drown,

30:40.166 --> 30:44.708
I won't offer my hand to save any of you.

30:45.250 --> 30:48.583
And all that you love, will sink with you!

30:49.833 --> 30:53.041
Let him go! Guards! Guards!

30:57.708 --> 30:59.250
What do you want?

30:59.333 --> 31:02.625
Police officer: Police. There's
been a report of a break in?

31:06.208 --> 31:10.041
He's messing with me. Two
days in a row now he's broken in.

31:10.083 --> 31:12.375
He's left things, taken things.

31:12.625 --> 31:14.333
I don't know what to do.

31:14.958 --> 31:17.541
He means me harm, that's for sure.

31:17.583 --> 31:19.916
Seems like he's playing with his food.

31:21.416 --> 31:22.625
Police officer: Okay.

31:22.791 --> 31:24.916
If you see him again, give us a call.

31:25.291 --> 31:28.416
I was close by when they called it
in, but we might not be so fast to

31:28.500 --> 31:32.499
respond next time. You don't feel safe?

31:32.541 --> 31:34.166
Maybe it's time to move on.

31:34.208 --> 31:36.833
Yeah, I'm here for a couple more days, so...

31:36.958 --> 31:41.833
Police officer: If I was being stalked,
alone on holiday, I'll be back home

31:41.875 --> 31:44.000
faster than a ferret up a drain pipe.

31:44.083 --> 31:46.458
Do you know who he is?

31:47.083 --> 31:50.041
Police officer: If I knew that, I'd be speaking with him.

31:53.208 --> 31:55.916
Can I see your actual I.D?

31:55.958 --> 31:58.375
Not just your uniform?

32:06.958 --> 32:09.541
Police officer: Have a good evening, sir.

33:11.208 --> 33:19.208
Woman: Open the door, light the way

33:25.291 --> 33:28.666
Our path led to Perusica, Bosnia.

33:29.250 --> 33:31.916
Several of the ones we tracked made their way there.

33:32.625 --> 33:35.833
A team of seven headed out in the expedition.

33:35.958 --> 33:39.124
My team had grown since the executive branch of our

33:39.166 --> 33:41.458
organization, increased our funding.

33:41.583 --> 33:46.541
They were fascinated by the
consistencies in our reports.

33:47.041 --> 33:50.749
We showed them the roadmap
of atrocities making its way to the

33:50.791 --> 33:53.666
Balkans from different continents.

33:54.166 --> 33:57.624
People leaving their signature
circle within a circle at

33:57.666 --> 34:00.541
every horror filled site.

34:02.708 --> 34:09.666
We spent months looking across the Bosnian
South, but we couldn't find anything.

34:11.000 --> 34:15.083
For the entire winter there
were no related incidents.

34:16.708 --> 34:19.625
We couldn't work out why.

34:19.791 --> 34:23.791
Eventually, we had to head home.

34:24.500 --> 34:27.666
With a lack of available plane
tickets during the holidays,

34:27.708 --> 34:30.000
we decided to drive back.

34:33.375 --> 34:41.375
But uh, at every town we stopped to
sleep we woke to stories of nightmares.

34:45.166 --> 34:52.833
As we moved from country to country
local police would find blood soaked

34:52.875 --> 34:59.708
sacrifices in woodland or, abandoned
buildings near wherever we stayed.

35:02.291 --> 35:08.541
We realised, we'd walked into their trap.

35:10.208 --> 35:13.958
They were tracking us.

35:15.208 --> 35:21.208
Where we moved, they did too,
leaving destruction behind them.

35:21.250 --> 35:25.625
We couldn't go home, we couldn't risk our families.

35:26.041 --> 35:30.708
The authorities logically decided it
didn't look good for us, moving along

35:30.750 --> 35:33.625
the same bloody trail across Europe.

35:35.375 --> 35:38.583
That's when the accusations against us started.

35:40.416 --> 35:45.916
So when we reached the UK, my team
started to hand themselves in one by one.

35:48.375 --> 35:56.375
Each one that did was found dead
just days later, along with their families.

35:57.791 --> 36:02.833
Each bearing the circle within a circle.

36:04.875 --> 36:09.375
Eventually, only my assistant
Paula and I remained together.

36:11.625 --> 36:16.041
I remembered a place in Wales
my family used to holiday at.

36:16.166 --> 36:19.333
An old cottage far from anywhere.

36:19.875 --> 36:25.750
If they followed us there, there'd
be limited collateral damage.

36:28.041 --> 36:31.416
It didn't take long for them to find us.

36:33.916 --> 36:41.166
Deep in the woods we, came across
them in the middle of one of their rituals.

36:42.625 --> 36:48.791
They had a man tied up as they cut his skin.

36:50.791 --> 36:56.791
Dozens of them just stood there in the dark watching.

36:59.291 --> 37:07.291
The most unsettling part wasn't
that they were opening him up, but

37:10.916 --> 37:13.916
that he seemed to enjoy it.

37:15.583 --> 37:17.833
He wanted it.

37:20.208 --> 37:26.750
Their leader just stood there in the dark watching.

37:29.916 --> 37:32.833
Seeing it, Paula couldn't help but scream.

37:34.208 --> 37:39.750
They chased us for hours through the woods.

37:40.250 --> 37:42.750
All of them.

37:46.333 --> 37:48.916
I got separated from her.

37:49.083 --> 37:55.750
I, I couldn't find her. I didn't find her.

37:59.458 --> 38:05.708
Months later, Paula turned up at a hospital.

38:05.750 --> 38:09.041
She just walked right up to the front door.

38:11.500 --> 38:15.541
But she wasn't her anymore.

38:18.000 --> 38:26.000
Almost feral, covered in strange
scars, but, but she was alive.

38:30.750 --> 38:33.750
I do thank someone up there for that.

38:37.291 --> 38:40.458
But they kept following me.

38:48.833 --> 38:55.583
I see the watcher outside
every day in black taunting me.

38:57.875 --> 39:01.875
I refuse to let them push me into madness.

39:05.458 --> 39:09.416
But I'm not sure how long I'm gonna last.

39:25.166 --> 39:29.041
Where are you?

41:39.458 --> 41:41.000
Karen.

41:41.458 --> 41:45.333
Chris? How can you do this to me?

41:45.416 --> 41:48.291
I had no idea if you were alive or dead.

41:48.333 --> 41:50.499
How could you just take off like that?

41:50.541 --> 41:53.333
No, I know, I know. I'm sorry.

41:53.375 --> 41:56.708
You know the call about Billy, it just, uh, it broke me.

41:56.750 --> 41:59.541
I had to, I had to see what happened.

42:01.500 --> 42:04.875
Why didn't you talk to me?

42:05.583 --> 42:07.208
We are a team.

42:07.291 --> 42:10.958
You don't just run away to
wherever you are without a word.

42:11.541 --> 42:13.333
Wales.

42:13.416 --> 42:14.791
What?

42:15.250 --> 42:16.666
But I'm coming home today.

42:16.708 --> 42:18.083
You know, I'm done.

42:18.333 --> 42:22.624
I just wanted to help Billy's family
work something out and you know, I

42:22.666 --> 42:24.750
just needed to know what happened.

42:25.166 --> 42:27.458
He was sick, Chris.

42:28.958 --> 42:34.249
I don't think he was, not anymore.

42:34.291 --> 42:37.208
I'm sorry about your friend. I really am.

42:37.250 --> 42:38.999
But he's gone now.

42:39.041 --> 42:40.916
Your family is right here.

42:40.958 --> 42:42.333
We need you.

42:42.375 --> 42:44.291
The baby will be here in a few weeks.

42:44.333 --> 42:46.124
What if he comes early?

42:46.166 --> 42:48.625
Yeah, you're right. I know, I know. You're right.

42:49.041 --> 42:50.708
I'm gonna get the first flight back.

42:50.750 --> 42:52.416
Okay? I promise.

42:52.875 --> 42:53.958
You promise?

42:54.125 --> 42:57.791
I swear, I really miss you.

42:58.625 --> 43:00.291
And bump.

43:00.541 --> 43:03.583
Then get home to us you asshole.

43:04.083 --> 43:05.500
Yes Ma'am.

43:06.208 --> 43:09.458
Now move your ass Rivers. We're waiting.

43:09.500 --> 43:11.708
And keep that damn phone on.

43:11.750 --> 43:14.041
Yeah, I'm on my way.

43:42.958 --> 43:45.625
Was it you?

43:46.500 --> 43:49.125
Did you make him do it?

43:50.583 --> 43:52.208
You stay away from me.

43:52.250 --> 43:53.458
Okay?

43:53.500 --> 43:55.416
You understand?

44:31.958 --> 44:35.083
Paula, can you hear me?

44:35.708 --> 44:37.916
Is that actually you?

44:37.958 --> 44:39.375
It's me.

44:40.416 --> 44:44.416
No it can't be true he's still in there.

44:44.916 --> 44:48.708
It's me, Paula. It's William.

44:50.208 --> 44:53.041
He liked the loudest music.

44:53.458 --> 44:59.708
Too loud, too angry for somebody who's never angry.

45:00.166 --> 45:02.208
I liked Billy.

45:03.208 --> 45:05.500
I always like you too.

45:07.000 --> 45:09.041
And it wasn't his fault.

45:09.083 --> 45:11.250
I wanted to go with him.

45:11.500 --> 45:13.750
Change our lives, he said.

45:13.875 --> 45:15.958
Change the world, maybe.

45:16.083 --> 45:18.291
I did say that.

45:19.291 --> 45:21.916
And he kept his promise.

45:24.708 --> 45:27.291
Everything did change.

45:27.708 --> 45:30.666
I'm sorry about what happened to you.

45:33.625 --> 45:36.166
It happened to him too.

45:36.333 --> 45:39.333
There are fingers pointing at us now, accusing us of

45:39.375 --> 45:41.333
what happened to our friends.

45:42.041 --> 45:48.583
I have to try and find more proof
and hopefully some hope for both of us.

45:48.625 --> 45:50.791
Hope!

45:52.541 --> 45:57.708
Hope, is nothing more than a shimmer on
the horizon, and no matter how many steps

45:57.750 --> 46:01.125
you take, it is out of reach both of us.

46:02.250 --> 46:03.875
Stop chasing the shimmer.

46:04.375 --> 46:09.333
Paula! Paula! Please!

46:25.791 --> 46:28.541
Why are you showing me this?

46:29.666 --> 46:32.958
Haven't you worked it out yet?

46:34.500 --> 46:37.625
You will.

47:04.416 --> 47:10.416
But if you are here, then you have the time.

47:10.958 --> 47:14.958
To, witness.

47:17.041 --> 47:25.041
If I'm being honest Chris, that's all I want.
A witness to prove I spent the end of my life

47:26.458 --> 47:31.333
on something tangible, something real.

47:34.708 --> 47:38.541
If you can do this for me, then we're square.

47:38.875 --> 47:44.083
I, release you from the guilt
you always felt, even though

47:44.166 --> 47:47.250
none of it was ever your fault.

47:50.041 --> 47:52.958
Do this for me Chris.

47:55.125 --> 47:57.416
Please.

48:48.375 --> 48:56.375
Walker 2: Open the door, light the way.

49:21.083 --> 49:24.458
The
Watcher: Do you know what they are?

49:28.500 --> 49:31.916
They are doorways.

49:33.208 --> 49:34.874
To where?

49:34.916 --> 49:39.333
Redemption, forgiveness.

49:39.583 --> 49:44.166
How can any of us spare the
weight of the guilt we carry?

49:44.666 --> 49:48.333
All that pain, all that guilt.

49:49.208 --> 49:52.166
She will help you wash it away.

49:52.916 --> 49:57.125
Like all doors, they are there to be opened.

49:57.541 --> 50:01.250
You hold the key in your hand.

50:05.416 --> 50:07.125
Open her up.

50:09.041 --> 50:10.708
No.

50:11.166 --> 50:13.375
Open her up.

50:15.083 --> 50:16.000
No.

50:16.500 --> 50:18.708
Open her up.

50:19.333 --> 50:20.250
No!

50:21.791 --> 50:23.875
Walkers: Open the door, light the way.

50:23.958 --> 50:26.291
Open them up!

50:26.916 --> 50:29.125
Open them up!

50:30.291 --> 50:31.958
Open them up!

50:32.500 --> 50:37.083
Open them up!

51:08.916 --> 51:10.708
Why are you doing this to me?

51:11.333 --> 51:14.250
We're trying to save you, Christopher.

51:15.125 --> 51:16.166
From what?

51:16.208 --> 51:17.666
From yourself.

51:17.708 --> 51:21.083
From those dark thoughts
you have when you want to rid

51:21.125 --> 51:24.250
yourself of the shame, the guilt.

51:24.375 --> 51:29.041
That guilt, that guilt is what keeps me going.

51:29.083 --> 51:30.999
That is a lie.

51:31.041 --> 51:34.125
It is the weight that drowns you.

51:34.625 --> 51:38.625
Open a doorway and be blessed.

51:39.083 --> 51:41.875
They are outside waiting.

51:42.041 --> 51:44.374
What will happen if I do?

51:44.416 --> 51:47.124
Each open door provides a little light into

51:47.166 --> 51:49.624
the darkness of the other side.

51:49.666 --> 51:57.666
The more doorways we open, the more light
seeps in until we eventually awaken, IT.

52:00.125 --> 52:03.999
You see IT wants to wake
and it bestows blessings upon

52:04.041 --> 52:06.208
those that provide more light.

52:06.250 --> 52:11.208
Blessings that can wash away the
stench of shame that follows you.

52:11.250 --> 52:13.916
How do you even know who I am?

52:14.000 --> 52:16.416
You know how.

52:18.458 --> 52:19.583
Billy.

52:19.625 --> 52:22.958
Ah, Billy.

52:23.375 --> 52:25.500
You.

52:26.916 --> 52:29.000
You fucking killed him.

52:29.166 --> 52:30.749
You fucking lynched him.

52:30.791 --> 52:34.999
No, he's one of the chosen, one of us.

52:35.041 --> 52:37.083
No, that's a fucking lie.

52:37.125 --> 52:40.291
He was tracking you people to reveal you, to stop you.

52:40.333 --> 52:42.416
Was he?

52:42.458 --> 52:46.000
Did he ever say he wanted to stop us?

52:46.875 --> 52:52.333
He was wounded, broken from
a tortured life he didn't deserve.

52:52.375 --> 52:57.958
He saw what we became full
of purpose, unburdened by the

52:58.041 --> 53:00.666
weight of our former lives.

53:00.750 --> 53:04.124
He saw us as his salvation.

53:04.166 --> 53:06.083
And unlike all of you.

53:06.166 --> 53:08.791
We would never abandon him.

53:08.833 --> 53:12.208
No, I always looked out for him.

53:12.291 --> 53:16.791
I've still got the scars from standing
between him and his piece of shit father.

53:17.291 --> 53:20.375
I always looked out for him.

53:21.833 --> 53:26.374
I showed him a normal life. I was
the one who tried to keep in touch.

53:26.416 --> 53:29.624
Billy's the one who stopped any effort to talk to me.

53:29.666 --> 53:31.916
I was his oldest friend.

53:31.958 --> 53:32.916
His only friend.

53:32.958 --> 53:35.291
Ah, so this is about you.

53:35.333 --> 53:38.874
We would never resent him
for the life he wanted to lead.

53:38.916 --> 53:42.000
Of course I fucking resent him.

53:42.208 --> 53:44.249
Why wouldn't he ask me for help?

53:44.291 --> 53:45.958
Or his mother or anyone?

53:46.000 --> 53:49.041
Why didn't he talk to me instead of
going some fucking goose chase looking

53:49.083 --> 53:50.749
for answers from nut jobs like you?

53:50.791 --> 53:53.291
He should have talked to me.

53:53.541 --> 53:56.250
I would've been there for him.

53:56.500 --> 54:00.333
All I ever wanted was to make sure
he was safe, to make sure he was happy,

54:00.458 --> 54:03.958
and it's fucking selfish what he did.

54:04.833 --> 54:08.374
Not a thought for the people that
loved him, not thinking of the devastation

54:08.416 --> 54:12.083
it would leave behind for his
loved ones, a single phone call, and I

54:12.125 --> 54:14.374
would've fucking been there for him.

54:14.416 --> 54:16.583
You fucking understand that?

54:16.625 --> 54:18.583
I would've been there for him.

54:18.625 --> 54:19.666
Not you.

54:19.708 --> 54:20.499
Not you.

54:20.541 --> 54:23.791
Who is the selfish one now Christopher?

54:24.291 --> 54:26.291
Billy called and called.

54:26.333 --> 54:27.958
Hey! Hey, hey hey No!

54:28.000 --> 54:31.874
Okay, now that was just to tell us his crazy stories.

54:31.916 --> 54:34.666
No, that was not to tell us the pain he was in.

54:34.708 --> 54:38.875
And why do you think
he needed to tell you these stories?

54:39.000 --> 54:44.166
The sound of your voice would've
soothed that pain you talk of.

54:44.666 --> 54:48.708
Instead, you ignored him.

54:52.791 --> 55:00.791
Provide an offering, open a doorway
and be blessed, or continue with

55:03.291 --> 55:09.625
being a selfish, spiteful creature
and drown with the rest of them.

55:09.708 --> 55:13.000
Choose!

55:44.541 --> 55:51.000
Walker: Open the door, light the way.

56:00.416 --> 56:08.416
Open the door, light the way!

56:25.250 --> 56:28.666
There is another way it notices you, of course.

56:28.791 --> 56:35.500
Defiance, rejection of its blessings,
that will anger it more than you know.

56:35.583 --> 56:38.000
Be very careful, Christopher.

56:38.083 --> 56:42.374
When you notice an anthill, you
do not take umbrage with one ant.

56:42.416 --> 56:45.583
You step on the whole hill.

56:46.250 --> 56:48.249
Do you understand?

56:48.291 --> 56:52.083
If you reject this gift we offer
you, our disappointment will

56:52.125 --> 56:54.708
not only be shown to yourself.

56:54.750 --> 57:00.541
But to your friends, your family,
Billy's family, his mother, your

57:00.625 --> 57:04.166
whore wife, your unborn child.

57:04.208 --> 57:08.874
Reject us and you'll drown in their blood.

57:08.916 --> 57:11.250
Choose wisely Christopher.

57:11.375 --> 57:15.291
Wisdom was never my strong suit.

58:14.500 --> 58:15.666
How can you do this?

58:15.708 --> 58:17.041
You piece of shit.

58:17.083 --> 58:18.374
Are you crazy?

58:18.416 --> 58:22.166
I can't believe you would talk
like that about me, about your child.

58:22.208 --> 58:26.958
I don't know if you are drunk or
you've just gone fucking nuts, but good.

58:27.000 --> 58:29.166
I don't ever wanna see you again either.

58:29.208 --> 58:31.166
Our child is better off without you.

58:31.208 --> 58:32.499
Both of us are.

58:32.541 --> 58:33.833
Next message

58:33.875 --> 58:37.833
Chris, what is wrong with you?

58:37.875 --> 58:40.041
I've just talked to Dean Forsett.

58:40.083 --> 58:42.208
He's firing you!

58:42.250 --> 58:45.499
Why would you say those things to
someone that's been so supportive of you?

58:45.541 --> 58:49.000
And now you haven't got the
guts to answer the phone to me.

58:49.125 --> 58:52.124
Wherever you are, stay in your hole.

58:52.166 --> 58:54.333
And rot!

58:54.375 --> 59:02.375
Open the door, light the way.

59:18.708 --> 59:26.708
Open the door, light the way.

01:00:41.083 --> 01:00:49.083
He's awake

01:00:54.291 --> 01:01:01.166
Chosen

01:01:12.916 --> 01:01:18.250
Blessed

01:01:51.458 --> 01:01:58.416
The light awakes. It sees.

01:01:59.291 --> 01:02:01.666
Did you see?

01:02:02.791 --> 01:02:07.541
He saw

01:02:11.333 --> 01:02:15.916
It sees you as we do.

01:02:18.875 --> 01:02:21.625
You're one of us now.

01:02:23.416 --> 01:02:25.166
Connected

01:02:27.916 --> 01:02:30.083
Guided

01:02:56.125 --> 01:02:58.125
Do you see?

01:03:17.458 --> 01:03:19.541
What's happening to me?

01:03:20.541 --> 01:03:22.583
The door was opened.

01:03:23.208 --> 01:03:26.250
It sees you, now.

01:03:29.583 --> 01:03:32.666
In turn it helps you see.

01:03:32.750 --> 01:03:34.666
What am I seeing?

01:03:34.708 --> 01:03:39.791
Blessings, connection, and foresight.

01:03:40.625 --> 01:03:44.541
What is and what will be.

01:03:44.625 --> 01:03:49.083
No! I won't.

01:03:49.791 --> 01:03:53.125
Where are you going, Christopher?

01:03:56.500 --> 01:03:58.916
Hmm, This is becoming tiresome.

01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.250
Get away from me.

01:04:01.333 --> 01:04:04.374
I'm afraid that's not an option anymore.

01:04:04.416 --> 01:04:07.750
We are linked, all of us.

01:04:15.208 --> 01:04:16.999
Careful, Christopher.

01:04:17.041 --> 01:04:19.916
We will not take rejection again.

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:23.166
Again?

01:04:28.375 --> 01:04:29.083
Billy.

01:04:29.125 --> 01:04:30.666
That coward.

01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:33.458
He refused his blessings.

01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:36.166
He didn't deserve what he was offered.

01:04:37.125 --> 01:04:39.541
He thought he could put up a fight.

01:04:39.583 --> 01:04:44.500
Thought he could refuse us, trying to keep us away.

01:04:45.083 --> 01:04:48.791
But he knew he couldn't resist forever.

01:04:57.541 --> 01:05:05.416
Unfortunately, he found
defiance a little too late in life.

01:05:06.666 --> 01:05:12.250
Eventually, our disappointment shone through.

01:05:13.250 --> 01:05:16.250
We left him in the outhouse.

01:05:22.750 --> 01:05:25.000
Good for you Billy.

01:05:26.625 --> 01:05:28.750
He was weak.

01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:39.500
That's not what I hear.

01:05:40.666 --> 01:05:44.375
The little piggie strung up the big bad wolf.

01:05:45.250 --> 01:05:47.208
He was a coward.

01:05:48.250 --> 01:05:51.583
We're only brave when we're scared.

01:05:52.333 --> 01:05:54.583
He stood up to you.

01:05:56.750 --> 01:05:58.708
Fucking yes Billy.

01:05:58.750 --> 01:06:00.250
Quiet!

01:06:02.458 --> 01:06:09.458
An evil empire defied by
the guy always picked last at school.

01:06:09.916 --> 01:06:12.124
This is about you.

01:06:12.166 --> 01:06:17.791
You are going to obey or your wife will
take your place, and how we will make

01:06:17.833 --> 01:06:22.291
her suffer along the baby inside of her.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:25.416
What were the options again?

01:06:25.458 --> 01:06:31.916
Submit, become one or your family is going to die.

01:06:33.375 --> 01:06:41.375
Yeah, well, A and B are endearing options.

01:06:48.666 --> 01:06:51.000
I choose option C.

01:06:51.541 --> 01:06:53.708
NO!

01:09:09.375 --> 01:09:11.916
Billy?

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.625
Where are we?

01:09:27.832 --> 01:09:29.416
I don't know.

01:09:34.500 --> 01:09:41.207
But I know I'm safe here,
somehow, and after everything that's,

01:09:42.250 --> 01:09:44.875
that's good enough for me.

01:09:48.332 --> 01:09:49.916
You shouldn't be here.

01:09:51.250 --> 01:09:53.916
I think I cheated them.

01:09:55.416 --> 01:09:57.166
Yeah.

01:09:57.666 --> 01:10:00.000
They don't like that.

01:10:01.083 --> 01:10:04.750
You did the same as me?

01:10:05.208 --> 01:10:07.083
Maybe.

01:10:08.458 --> 01:10:12.333
I think I zigged when I should have zagged.

01:10:17.125 --> 01:10:20.208
I can't quite remember.

01:10:21.458 --> 01:10:23.916
They told me you were one of them.

01:10:26.250 --> 01:10:29.958
Their lies trying to make you see what isn't there.

01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.541
They told me you fought some of them off.

01:10:34.666 --> 01:10:41.541
Well, turns out I am pretty
formidable when I get pushed.

01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:50.250
I think I created this place,

01:10:52.458 --> 01:10:57.208
to have somewhere protected.

01:10:59.416 --> 01:11:02.541
From them.

01:11:05.250 --> 01:11:08.083
Are you okay?

01:11:13.041 --> 01:11:18.625
I fade every day.

01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:23.500
I forget more, but

01:11:23.750 --> 01:11:26.750
that's okay.

01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:32.000
It's my time.

01:11:33.541 --> 01:11:36.250
My terms.

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:44.041
Can I stay with you?

01:11:44.250 --> 01:11:47.875
Hey, no, no. It's not your time.

01:11:49.041 --> 01:11:56.333
Besides, you have a son to meet first.

01:11:58.333 --> 01:11:59.416
A son?

01:11:59.458 --> 01:12:01.416
Yeah.

01:12:04.083 --> 01:12:06.250
We didn't even know yet.

01:12:07.208 --> 01:12:09.583
You'll be a good father, Chris.

01:12:15.083 --> 01:12:18.000
I dunno.

01:12:18.708 --> 01:12:21.666
How do even know that?

01:12:21.708 --> 01:12:29.083
Because, you always looked after me.

01:12:31.750 --> 01:12:37.291
This guilt, you're running from.

01:12:37.416 --> 01:12:40.083
It just means you care.

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:44.916
You don't need it anymore.

01:12:45.458 --> 01:12:52.791
You were more than I was and
you need to realise that's okay.

01:12:55.833 --> 01:12:59.375
Swimming in your wake,

01:13:01.041 --> 01:13:06.333
it just made me a stronger swimmer.

01:13:07.333 --> 01:13:11.625
You stopped me from sinking.

01:13:22.125 --> 01:13:24.416
You big wimp.

01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.583
Me?

01:13:27.083 --> 01:13:31.416
Hey! I am terrifying.

01:13:41.666 --> 01:13:44.375
So what happens now?

01:13:45.791 --> 01:13:48.291
It's clear.

01:13:48.333 --> 01:13:49.750
Is it?

01:13:52.708 --> 01:13:54.749
Clear!

01:13:54.791 --> 01:13:56.291
Emergency Resonder: Can you hear me?

01:13:56.333 --> 01:13:58.374
Sir? Can you hear me?

01:13:58.416 --> 01:14:00.833
We're gonna lose him if we don't move him right now!

01:14:00.875 --> 01:14:03.875
Are you ready? Lets go, lets go, lets go!

01:14:20.125 --> 01:14:22.041
Police officer: Mr Rivers?

01:14:29.375 --> 01:14:32.666
Take it easy, take it easy. It's Okay.

01:14:36.875 --> 01:14:38.916
How? How am I here?

01:14:38.958 --> 01:14:42.416
Police Officer: I came back to the cottage to
see how you're getting on, and I found your hire

01:14:42.458 --> 01:14:48.416
car still there and a pool of blood in the
field with no body, I assumed not great.

01:14:50.875 --> 01:14:53.375
You're lucky to be here, Chris.

01:14:54.083 --> 01:14:56.875
Now, can you remember anything
at all about what happened to you?

01:14:58.250 --> 01:15:01.458
We'll discuss this when you're all healed up. Okay?

01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:06.000
If there is any sign of wrong doing,
I'll have to look into that I'm afraid.

01:15:06.166 --> 01:15:12.000
But for now, I believe someone wants to talk to you.

01:15:17.750 --> 01:15:20.166
Chris?

01:15:20.500 --> 01:15:22.041
Karen?

01:15:22.083 --> 01:15:24.541
It's me, baby.

01:15:25.791 --> 01:15:27.333
It wasn't me.

01:15:27.375 --> 01:15:28.499
It wasn't me, Karen.

01:15:28.541 --> 01:15:30.666
I know. It's okay, It's okay.

01:15:30.708 --> 01:15:33.249
They told me what someone had done to you.

01:15:33.291 --> 01:15:35.916
All I care about now is if you're all right.

01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:37.208
I haven't slept.

01:15:37.250 --> 01:15:40.124
I've been pacing, staring at my
phone for hours while you've been out.

01:15:40.166 --> 01:15:41.750
I'm so sorry.

01:15:42.166 --> 01:15:43.416
I'm so sorry.

01:15:43.458 --> 01:15:47.291
Don't you worry about that
now, we are going to get you on your feet.

01:15:47.333 --> 01:15:49.499
We're gonna bring you home to your family.

01:15:49.541 --> 01:15:51.416
I'm going to look after you.

01:15:51.458 --> 01:15:54.541
They say they will tell me when
you're back on your feet so...

01:15:54.583 --> 01:15:56.624
...I can get you a ticket home.

01:15:56.666 --> 01:15:58.333
Chris v/o: There's too much
we don't know about what lives in

01:15:58.375 --> 01:16:00.583
the darkness outside our doors.

01:16:00.666 --> 01:16:04.000
We sit ignorant in the comfort of our mundane lives.

01:16:06.833 --> 01:16:12.166
Safe in the knowledge that we can
comprehend every possible danger.

01:16:12.750 --> 01:16:16.541
But, for those of you who
ignore that friend with the crazy

01:16:16.583 --> 01:16:22.791
stories about the end of the world. Maybe, just maybe...

01:16:23.666 --> 01:16:25.333
