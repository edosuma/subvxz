WEBVTT

00:01.460 --> 00:03.201
ALEX: This is a great
engagement party,

00:03.504 --> 00:05.916
but I get the "P"-shaped
sandwiches for Penny and Pete,

00:06.215 --> 00:07.546
but what is with
the lowercase "B's"?

00:08.842 --> 00:10.753
Uh...
Uh, yeah.

00:11.053 --> 00:12.669
Anyways, | can't
believe that Penny is late

00:12.971 --> 00:14.132
for her own
engagement party.

00:14.431 --> 00:16.138
| can't believe Penny sent
out a "Save A Date" card

00:16.433 --> 00:18.094
and asked us to hold
every month but February.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.930
| can't believe anyone
voluntarily decided to marry Penny.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.891
| mean... (LAUGHS)

00:23.190 --> 00:24.430
She's a disaster of a
human woman. Am I right?

00:25.234 --> 00:27.726
(LAUGHS)

00:28.028 --> 00:31.111
Okay, you guys are all consistently
misleading me with fake pile-ons.

00:31.406 --> 00:33.989
Hi! I am so sorry
I'm late.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.491
| got super caught up
doing wedding stuff.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.653
Hello, Steve-who-couldn't-commit
to-a-serious-relationship.

00:38.956 --> 00:40.446
Check out this rock.

00:40.749 --> 00:41.955
And, no, ya can't smoke it.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.577
| never asked...
How was rehab?

00:46.880 --> 00:48.621
So you're here now.

00:48.924 --> 00:50.881
Let's get started
on the presents.

00:51.176 --> 00:52.211
Oh! (GIGGLES) Ooh,
Penny, let me go first.

00:52.511 --> 00:53.296
Let me go first.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.131
| got you...

00:56.139 --> 00:58.050
(GASPS)
Oh!

00:58.350 --> 01:00.933
A blender.
Nay, a blendaddy.

01:01.228 --> 01:02.844
Weird.
This thing whisks.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.807
This thing grinds.
This thing mixes.

01:05.107 --> 01:07.269
Throw a lobster in here,
make a bisque.

01:07.568 --> 01:09.104
Frappe up your milk
for a 'puccino.

01:09.403 --> 01:10.393
(BLENDER WHIRRING LOUDLY)

01:10.696 --> 01:12.152
Max, are you
selling those?

01:12.447 --> 01:14.029
Actually, we're all
selling these.

01:14.324 --> 01:17.817
We each have to push 15 units
and then give me the money,

01:18.120 --> 01:20.737
or I am in a very bad way
with some very bad people.

01:21.039 --> 01:22.200
(WHIRRING STOPS)

01:22.499 --> 01:23.660
(WHISPERS) Greek orthodox.

01:23.959 --> 01:25.199
Thank you for that.

01:25.502 --> 01:26.958
(CLEARS THROAT)
And this...

01:27.254 --> 01:27.914
Is from me. (LAUGHS)
Aw!

01:29.298 --> 01:30.413
(GASPS)
JANE'S VOICE: Hey-o!

01:30.716 --> 01:31.751
Ah! I'm gonna be
your wedding planner.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.256
I'm gonna be your
wedding planner.

01:33.552 --> 01:33.962
I'm gonna be your
wedding planner.

01:35.387 --> 01:36.877
| love it. Thank you.

01:37.180 --> 01:40.013
Why work with an impersonal
professional wedding planner?

01:40.309 --> 01:42.346
You need someone who
knows you, who loves you,

01:42.644 --> 01:44.180
and would rather burn
your wedding to the ground

01:44.479 --> 01:46.436
than see
anyone else plan it.

01:46.732 --> 01:48.063
You did have the best
wedding I've ever been to.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.940
Hello!
Standing right here!

01:50.235 --> 01:51.942
| think our wedding was,
uh, pretty spectacular.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.398
Yeah.
The only thing missing

01:53.697 --> 01:55.153
was a bride who stayed for
the duration of the ceremony.

01:55.449 --> 01:56.735
Hey-0!
Ooh!

01:57.034 --> 01:57.774
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
Ooh!

01:58.076 --> 01:59.566
Come on. What?
He's got the hot hand.

01:59.870 --> 02:01.577
| am so excited
to get started.

02:01.872 --> 02:04.159
You are gonna have
the best wedding ever.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.619
Pete, are you excited?

02:05.917 --> 02:06.827
Pete?
Peter?

02:07.127 --> 02:08.458
Pete-est?
Baby?

02:08.753 --> 02:10.539
(GASPS) Oh, crap! Damn it!
| forgot to invite Pete!

02:10.839 --> 02:12.170
(GASPS)
ALL: What?

02:12.466 --> 02:13.046
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
What am I gonna do?

02:14.051 --> 02:15.587
So this is all...

02:15.886 --> 02:18.127
ALL: Surprise
engagement party!

02:18.430 --> 02:18.965
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
What? No!

02:19.264 --> 02:19.878
(LAUGHS) What?

02:21.266 --> 02:22.552
What? (LAUGHS)

02:23.894 --> 02:25.851
What? No!

02:26.146 --> 02:28.228
(LAUGHS)
Oh, my God! No.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.692
Mmm. Are you sure
we're not super late?

02:41.995 --> 02:43.781
It looks like this party has
been going on for a while.

02:44.081 --> 02:47.244
No. No, these are not
deflated balloons.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.874
They are just simply
floating at half-mast

02:50.170 --> 02:52.912
in honor of all your
fallen former lovers.

02:53.215 --> 02:53.579
(ALEX SNORING LOUDLY)
Hmm.

02:53.882 --> 02:55.873
And behold!

02:56.176 --> 02:57.962
This beautiful
sleeping nymph

02:58.261 --> 03:00.218
symbolizes our love.

03:00.514 --> 03:01.675
(SLAPS COUCH) (LOWERED
VOICE) Wake up, you tiny whore.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.338
Huh?
She really is small

03:03.642 --> 03:05.053
and tuckered out from
all her whoring.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.263
Yet she has
a heart of gold. So...

03:08.230 --> 03:09.516
So...
Hmm.

03:09.815 --> 03:12.273
What more can be said
but "so"?

03:12.567 --> 03:14.979
What a party, huh?
Penny, what's going on?

03:15.278 --> 03:17.110
You are not even gonna
believe... Tell the truth.

03:17.406 --> 03:18.692
My computer totally
crashed... Not a half-truth.

03:18.990 --> 03:19.821
It's sort of a funny
story... Or a quarter-truth.

03:20.117 --> 03:21.323
Al right.

03:21.618 --> 03:24.235
Look, I, I've been super
busy since we got engaged,

03:24.538 --> 03:26.654
and I forgot to put your
e-mail on the invite list.

03:26.957 --> 03:29.119
| made it a Peteless post.
(MOUTHS WORD)

03:29.751 --> 03:31.537
Penny...

03:31.837 --> 03:33.544
Penny?
I'm sorry.

03:33.839 --> 03:36.752
From here on out, we will make
every single decision together...

03:37.050 --> 03:38.666
Except for the location
and the band,

03:38.969 --> 03:40.425
which I already booked.
Chicago and Chicago!

03:40.721 --> 03:42.337
They owe me.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.470
| saved the drummer from
choking on a hushpuppy once

03:43.765 --> 03:44.755
at the state fair.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.264
Took him a while
to recover,

03:46.560 --> 03:47.721
but he's feelin' stronger
every day.

03:48.019 --> 03:50.431
Hey-o! Hot hand
transfer alert!

03:50.731 --> 03:51.766
I'll take it.
Yes.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.306
BRAD: Yeah.
So are we good?

03:54.609 --> 03:56.270
The thing is,
| always wanted to, uh...

03:57.404 --> 03:58.644
Elope.

03:58.947 --> 03:59.482
What?
(GASPS) No!

04:00.866 --> 04:02.903
Uh, what?
I'm... I'm cool with that.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.783
(CHUCKLES) I mean,
it's a little unorthodox.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.443
But if you wanna serve
antelope at the wedding,

04:06.747 --> 04:08.329
| say I'm game for game.

04:08.623 --> 04:10.739
(CHUCKLES)
No, I said "elope.”

04:11.042 --> 04:12.328
Oh, cantaloupe. It's
refreshing but not an entree.

04:13.920 --> 04:14.660
Elope.

04:18.466 --> 04:19.207
Got it. Goin' down.

04:19.509 --> 04:20.499
(THUD)

04:20.802 --> 04:21.257
Ah!
Ay!

04:22.345 --> 04:23.927
So...

04:24.222 --> 04:26.338
Penny took that hardwood
floor to the head like a boss, huh?

04:26.641 --> 04:27.881
Pete was joking before, right?
We will have a wedding, right?

04:28.185 --> 04:29.016
| was promised
a wedding.

04:29.311 --> 04:31.769
Oh, no.
Here comes Bride Kong.

04:32.063 --> 04:34.350
Frankenbride. Creature
from the Bride Lagoon.

04:34.649 --> 04:35.889
(LOWERED VOICE)
You're looking for Bridezilla.

04:36.193 --> 04:38.025
(GASPS) That is good!
(WHISPERS) Yeah.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.776
Dave was a total Bridezilla
planning our wedding.

04:40.071 --> 04:41.857
No, I was just passionate.

04:42.157 --> 04:44.068
Would you call Jonas
Salk "Poliozilla"? Hmm?

04:44.367 --> 04:45.778
Or George Clooney
"Darfurzilla"?

04:46.077 --> 04:48.114
Or the founder of
the real estate site Zillow,

04:48.413 --> 04:49.744
"Zillowzilla"?
Not good examples.

04:50.040 --> 04:51.576
| was not a Bridezilla,
all right.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.037
And even if I was, | would
be called a Groomazilla.

04:54.336 --> 04:55.667
"Groomzilla"
is not a word

04:55.962 --> 04:57.794
because it never needed
to exist before.

04:58.089 --> 04:59.625
Oh, okay, so now I'm the bad
guy "cause I wanted to have

04:59.925 --> 05:01.415
an elegant
Timberlake/Btei-style wedding,

05:01.718 --> 05:02.958
while you wanted to
walk down the aisle

05:03.261 --> 05:04.626
carrying a bouquet
of fireworks.

05:04.930 --> 05:06.887
Look, man, I was just trying
to put asses in the seats.

05:07.182 --> 05:09.594
You wanted to have a baby
animal petting zoo at the reception.

05:09.893 --> 05:11.179
It's better than your
idea... Having a band?

05:13.146 --> 05:14.011
Look, all I'm saying is,
| wish you would've

05:14.314 --> 05:15.145
let me have more say
at our wedding.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.602
The caricaturist
was your idea.

05:17.901 --> 05:19.767
| still don't get why you had
this place hang yours up.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.060
It's called
owning it, dude.

05:21.905 --> 05:23.145
Uh-oh.
Mmm.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.688
(SIGHS) Hey, you guys.

05:24.991 --> 05:27.949
Ugh. Pete still
wants to elope?

05:28.245 --> 05:30.282
Apparently, Pete's dumb
brother and his dumb fiancee

05:30.580 --> 05:32.116
got so caught up
in wedding details

05:32.415 --> 05:34.201
that they lost sight
of what's important.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.833
So Pete wants to get
married on a beach... Oh!

05:37.128 --> 05:38.710
Just the two of us...
(BRAD GROANS)

05:39.005 --> 05:41.747
With only the sounds of waves
crashing and our hearts beating.

05:42.050 --> 05:43.632
Monster. He's a monster.
MAX: Mmm.

05:43.927 --> 05:46.840
No, Pete wants a wedding.
He just doesn't know it yet.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.594
(SIGHS) There is a Valentine's
Day weekend wedding expo

05:48.890 --> 05:50.506
downtown today.
(GASPS)

05:50.809 --> 05:51.719
Okay, we're gonna
take Pete there,

05:52.018 --> 05:52.758
and I'm gonna
change his mind,

05:53.061 --> 05:54.472
or they don't call me
"bitch" behind my back.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.057
(WHISPERS) She knows.
(WHISPERS) I know.

05:56.356 --> 05:59.565
This expo is
going to blow Pete's mind.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.897
There is free food, free
drinks, free giveaways.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.651
Giveaways?
Oh, I'm in!

06:03.947 --> 06:06.154
Let's all go! | was
already planning on going.

06:06.449 --> 06:08.156
What? Wait. Is this gonna
be a classic group gang hang?

06:08.451 --> 06:09.532
ALL: Yeah!

06:09.828 --> 06:11.318
(GIGGLING)

06:11.621 --> 06:12.827
(GASPS) Oh.

06:13.123 --> 06:13.988
Sorry. Uh...
(SNIFFS)

06:19.296 --> 06:22.379
Okeydokey,
Lee la-coke-ies.

06:22.674 --> 06:24.790
Now the individual tickets
don't get you all the free stuff,

06:25.093 --> 06:25.753
so I had to get you
couples passes, all right?

06:26.052 --> 06:27.042
(GASPS) Ooh.
Dave...

06:27.345 --> 06:28.631
And Alex.

06:28.930 --> 06:31.262
Ugh. Why do I have to
be couples with Dave?

06:31.558 --> 06:32.639
Because you are
couples with Dave.

06:32.934 --> 06:33.765
But it's gonna be
a nightmare

06:34.060 --> 06:35.300
being with Bridezilla
for this thing.

06:35.604 --> 06:38.687
No. Today,
| am... Chillzilla.

06:38.982 --> 06:40.017
You know what, Al, why
don't you take me in there?

06:40.317 --> 06:41.398
You show me your idea
of a perfect wedding.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.229
I'm sure I'll love it.
Okay?

06:43.528 --> 06:45.895
You guys owe me...
(LOWERED VOICE) Big-time.

06:46.197 --> 06:48.359
How do we owe you? That's
your boyfriend you chose.

06:48.658 --> 06:49.318
You're dating him. You
guys live in the same house.

06:50.035 --> 06:50.820
Okay.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.360
Max and Brad.
PENNY: Oh!

06:53.663 --> 06:55.825
Um... Wait. Why aren't |
couples with you?

06:56.124 --> 07:00.209
Oh, because I got this special
VIP wedding planner pass,

07:00.503 --> 07:02.995
and that turns me on sexually
in a way no man ever could.

07:03.715 --> 07:05.331
Pardon?

07:05.634 --> 07:08.092
| mean, I have to help Penny
convince Pete to have a wedding.

07:08.386 --> 07:09.922
Come on, boo.

07:10.221 --> 07:11.586
It's not like you never thought
about it, Harvey chocolate Milk.

07:11.890 --> 07:12.925
| never thought
about it.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.306
(GASPS) Okay, backstory.
(PATS BACK)

07:15.602 --> 07:17.184
You've pined after me
for years.

07:17.479 --> 07:19.265
My only previous
interracial relationship

07:19.564 --> 07:21.475
was with a Basque, but it
ended because for a separatist,

07:21.775 --> 07:23.516
he was quite clingy.

07:23.818 --> 07:24.933
Wait. You really got
Pete to come?

07:25.236 --> 07:26.567
Of course,
because he loves...

07:26.863 --> 07:28.194
(REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING)

07:28.490 --> 07:30.276
Reggae.
Reggae.

07:30.575 --> 07:33.033
Looks like this reggae fest
is a wedding expo.

07:33.328 --> 07:35.160
You lied to him?
Okay, I did not know

07:35.455 --> 07:37.321
he was gonna come in like
he just shot the sheriff.

07:37.624 --> 07:38.409
Not bad, right?
Yes.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.198
(CHUCKLES)

07:40.502 --> 07:42.209
Pete, before you
decide to elope... Mmm.

07:42.504 --> 07:44.791
Why don't you let Penny and I show
you what your wedding could be?

07:45.090 --> 07:46.501
No pressure.
It's totally your call.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.256
| don't want you to
feel like you have to...

07:48.551 --> 07:51.043
Wear that Rasta beret
one more minute.

07:51.346 --> 07:53.804
Well, obviously, it means
a lot to you both, so...

07:54.099 --> 07:55.385
Let's expo.

07:55.684 --> 07:56.799
Yes! Yes! Yes! Thank
you! Thank you! Yeah!

07:57.102 --> 07:58.433
You're welcome.
And I swear,

07:58.728 --> 08:00.469
we will go to reggae fest
just as soon as this is over.

08:00.772 --> 08:02.479
Yah, we be jammin',
mon.

08:03.775 --> 08:04.515
There be no
reggae fest, Pete.

08:06.111 --> 08:07.442
DAVE: It's spectacular.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.898
ALEX: Yeah. It's amazing.

08:09.197 --> 08:11.689
So classic.
So unforgettable.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.107
| mean, that's the kind of thing
that makes an entire wedding.

08:13.410 --> 08:14.525
Oh, undoubtedly.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.490
That is one magnificent
shan-dell-yay...

08:17.789 --> 08:19.746
Or, as the unwashed masses
call it, chandelier.

08:20.041 --> 08:20.826
No, no, I meant that.

08:21.126 --> 08:22.958
(LAUGHS) Bouncy house.

08:23.253 --> 08:24.835
The bride and the groom can
have their first bounce in it.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.417
So, Dave,
what do ya think? Huh?

08:27.716 --> 08:29.047
Would you be cool with having
a bouncy house at a wedding?

08:30.677 --> 08:31.712
No, I would not.

08:32.011 --> 08:33.548
| knew it.
| would, however,

08:33.847 --> 08:36.009
be cool with having two
bouncy houses at a wedding...

08:36.307 --> 08:38.674
One for the bride's family,
one for the groom's family.

08:38.977 --> 08:40.763
That way, there's twice the
amount of bounce floors to tear up.

08:41.895 --> 08:42.476
(WHISPERS) Chillzilla!

08:46.192 --> 08:48.354
That future baby booth
was a sham, bro.

08:48.653 --> 08:49.814
There's no way our kids
would look like this.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.478
(LAUGHS) It looks like
black chunk.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.146
It looks like the third Gumbel
brother... Yitzak Gumbel.

08:53.450 --> 08:54.906
Ha!

08:55.201 --> 08:57.488
<i>Whoa, Max. Check out
gay town over there. on.</i>

08:57.787 --> 08:59.903
(SIGHS) Very nice, Brad.
Why is it gay town?

09:00.206 --> 09:02.914
'Cause it's two handsome,
well-dressed, in-shape guys?

09:03.209 --> 09:04.165
You've heard of
colorblindness, right?

09:04.461 --> 09:05.576
Well, I wish you had
sexual blindness.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.745
Actually, no, I don't.

09:08.048 --> 09:09.709
That is a real disease.
| did a run-walk for it.

09:10.008 --> 09:12.966
| mostly walked, but, you
know, my presence was felt.

09:14.095 --> 09:14.800
Max.

09:16.765 --> 09:18.756
MAX: Oh! It is gay town.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.845
Yeah. It's a classic
Max knee-jerk reaction,

09:21.144 --> 09:23.351
followed by a classic Max
false apology.

09:23.646 --> 09:24.681
Brad...
(WHISPERS) I am so sorry.

09:24.981 --> 09:26.096
(WHISPERS) Forgiven.

09:26.399 --> 09:27.309
Let's go to gay town!
(GIGGLES)

09:28.860 --> 09:30.146
Hey, Jane?
Yeah, Penny?

09:30.445 --> 09:32.027
Did you hear the news?
What news?

09:32.322 --> 09:34.484
Pete doesn't like
weddings. What?

09:34.783 --> 09:37.275
Well, I didn't like Korean
spas till I learned the phrase

09:37.577 --> 09:40.069
"I don't want to bleed today"
in Korean, and now I love 'em!

09:40.371 --> 09:44.205
Prepare to be dazzled by
all the wedding possibilities.

09:44.501 --> 09:45.991
Like what kind of cake
do you want?

09:46.294 --> 09:48.956
Vanilla? Ugh. Chocolate?
Shut up. Red velvet?

09:49.255 --> 09:51.542
That's just chocolate with
food coloring, ya dumb moron.

09:51.841 --> 09:54.708
Why have one of those
when you could have...

09:55.011 --> 09:56.046
(SINGSONGY)
A chicken wing cake?

09:56.346 --> 09:58.007
(SINGSONGY)
Or a bleu cheese fountain?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.547
Mmm, mmm, mmm!
Yum! Yum! Mmm!

10:00.850 --> 10:02.636
That is latex paint
and it is for display only.

10:02.936 --> 10:03.801
Excuse me.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.516
And no wedding
would be complete

10:07.816 --> 10:09.352
without music.

10:09.651 --> 10:11.062
Mmm, that's my cue.
Mmm-hmm.

10:11.361 --> 10:13.523
String quartet? ADJ?
(REGGAE MUSIC PLAYING)

10:13.822 --> 10:17.531
Red red wine-not have
a reggae band?

10:17.826 --> 10:19.612
| know you love reggae.
| learned that today.

10:19.911 --> 10:22.619
| do love reggae
and I do love chicken wings.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.656
Then you are gonna love
dinner, "cause it's neither.

10:25.959 --> 10:27.370
Hey, Pen?
What, Jane?

10:27.669 --> 10:29.080
What's for dinner?

10:29.379 --> 10:31.086
Ooh, that's a good question.
Thought you'd never ask.

10:31.381 --> 10:32.587
Steak? Pasta?

10:32.882 --> 10:34.213
How about sushi?

10:34.509 --> 10:36.841
And how about it served
by a pretty lady?

10:37.137 --> 10:39.674
No, ya dope! Let's
serve it on a pretty lady.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.008
Ooh!
Oh, ho!

10:41.307 --> 10:42.843
Maybe I've been a little
too hard on weddings.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.225
(SLAPS HAND) I think she's
a little too pretty. No offense.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.851
| mean, you wouldn't want
you at your wedding, right?

10:47.147 --> 10:49.309
| actually eloped.
Weddings are kinda crazy.

10:49.607 --> 10:50.893
And that's enough out
of you, ya human platter.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.057
Big finish!

10:52.360 --> 10:53.270
And that's...

10:53.570 --> 10:55.060
(BOTH SINGING) The end.

10:56.406 --> 10:57.771
Okay, Dave,
you're gonna love this.

10:58.074 --> 10:59.530
(GASPS) Ta-da!

11:00.535 --> 11:02.993
An underwater wedding.

11:03.288 --> 11:04.619
You always said you
look great in a one-piece.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.906
| just don't understand why they're
not acceptable for men anymore.

11:08.209 --> 11:09.370
Uh-huh. But a scuba
wedding would be...

11:10.461 --> 11:11.075
Delightful, Alex.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.079
Really?
| love it.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.543
(GROANS IN DISGUST)
All right, Dave, you win.

11:15.842 --> 11:16.673
Even I think
this is a stupid idea.

11:18.636 --> 11:20.422
But I gotta hand it to you.
You are being very chill.

11:20.722 --> 11:21.587
Let's go get a char-dog.

11:21.890 --> 11:22.721
Chillzilla.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.256
(GASPS)

11:24.559 --> 11:26.095
Beige napkins.

11:26.394 --> 11:29.762
This is the exact shade | wanted
for our wedding. (GROANS)

11:30.064 --> 11:31.054
What?
Beige napkins are pretty.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.473
Yeah, they're great.
They're great.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.393
You know, you could even
put them at every place setting,

11:36.696 --> 11:38.232
folded in the shape
of a middle finger,

11:38.531 --> 11:40.238
because that is the message
you are sending to your guests

11:40.533 --> 11:42.149
with beige napkins,

11:42.452 --> 11:43.692
because beige has
no place at a wedding!

11:44.579 --> 11:45.990
(GASPS) Dave.

11:46.289 --> 11:46.778
Out of the way, yuppie!

11:47.749 --> 11:48.705
There it is.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.375
Check out
all this free stuff.

11:52.670 --> 11:53.580
How you feelin' gay
town now, boo? Lovin' it.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.917
Lovin' you.
Lovin' us. (LAUGHS)

11:56.216 --> 11:58.332
(GASPS) And this is my
favorite line of bath products.

11:58.635 --> 12:00.376
You guys are totally
an adorable couple.

12:00.678 --> 12:01.964
You are so cute.

12:02.263 --> 12:03.173
You're like Paul Giamatti
and Tyson Beckford.

12:03.473 --> 12:04.338
Oh, yeah!
Right?

12:04.641 --> 12:06.382
But wait. He doesn't
look like Paul Gia...

12:06.684 --> 12:09.142
(CLEARS THROAT) Oh.

12:09.437 --> 12:11.348
So, um, we would like some
things for our welcome bags

12:11.648 --> 12:12.763
for our 300-plus guests,

12:13.066 --> 12:14.852
who are all tastemakers
and online reviewers

12:15.151 --> 12:17.017
and style icons, etcetera,
etcetera. (INHALES DEEPLY)

12:17.320 --> 12:18.936
Right, hon-bun?
Mmm! Hmm? Mmm-hmm.

12:19.239 --> 12:21.071
Elton and David would just
eat these soap balls up.

12:21.366 --> 12:22.731
(GASPS)
Elton...

12:23.034 --> 12:24.320
John? Okay.
John? Okay.

12:24.619 --> 12:25.825
And by the scent of these, you
know who else would love them?

12:26.120 --> 12:27.451
Barney Frank.
Frank.

12:27.747 --> 12:28.987
(WHISPERS) Barney Frank.
(SQUEAKS)

12:29.290 --> 12:30.576
People don't think so,

12:30.875 --> 12:33.242
but Barney Frank is way
into the way his body smells.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.785
Okay, you know what? Since
you guys are such lovebirds,

12:36.089 --> 12:37.705
you can take
whatever you'd like.

12:38.007 --> 12:39.839
(GIGGLES) Yay!
(LAUGHS)

12:40.134 --> 12:42.546
Ahem.
(DEEP VOICE) Yeah.

12:42.845 --> 12:43.801
| mean...
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Yay!

12:44.097 --> 12:46.384
(GIGGLING) Okay. Okay.

12:46.683 --> 12:47.718
Okay, I'll just take
two bags.

12:48.017 --> 12:49.724
(CHUCKLES)

12:50.019 --> 12:51.976
(LOWERED VOICE) Okay, you gotta
break up with me. | just got a turnaround.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.103
(LOWERED VOICE)
What's a turnaround?

12:53.398 --> 12:54.559
When two gay guys
walk past each other,

12:54.857 --> 12:57.064
if they turnaround,
it's on.

12:57.360 --> 12:59.101
Oh. (CHUCKLES)
You just got that?

12:59.404 --> 13:01.270
Yes! I just got a turnaround,
so I don't need a you-around.

13:01.572 --> 13:02.607
| am not breaking up
with you.

13:02.907 --> 13:04.568
This is a gold mine, man.

13:04.867 --> 13:05.948
What are you
talking about?

13:06.244 --> 13:07.234
We haven't even redeemed
our couple's coupon

13:07.537 --> 13:08.527
for that awesome
nail salon booth

13:08.830 --> 13:09.865
run by Tom Petty's cousin
Manuel...

13:10.164 --> 13:11.245
Manny Petty's mani-pedis.

13:11.541 --> 13:13.373
Okay. Fine.

13:13.668 --> 13:14.624
(GASPS LOUDLY)

13:15.169 --> 13:16.534
Brad!

13:16.838 --> 13:18.875
You're breaking
up with me? What?

13:19.173 --> 13:20.880
And so close to
St. Valentine's Day?

13:21.175 --> 13:22.586
What was that?

13:22.885 --> 13:24.046
You don't want to get
married to me?

13:24.345 --> 13:25.927
It's just a piece of paper?

13:26.222 --> 13:28.384
It's about
civil rights, sir!

13:28.683 --> 13:29.718
Which you would know
nothing about!

13:30.893 --> 13:32.008
I'm out of herel

13:35.398 --> 13:38.060
Can I get th...
Just.. just get out of here.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.020
Then your guests write
their hopes for you

13:40.320 --> 13:41.526
inside the lantern...
(GASPS)

13:41.821 --> 13:43.482
Which floats up
into the air,

13:43.781 --> 13:45.692
lighting the sky with
all their loving wishes.

13:45.992 --> 13:47.574
(GASPS) Aw!

13:47.869 --> 13:49.610
Right, Pete?

13:49.912 --> 13:50.743
Yeah, that is pretty...
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE) Aw!

13:51.039 --> 13:52.370
Aw!
Aw!

13:52.665 --> 13:53.871
| knew you would
come around, Pete.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.575
Oh! And...

13:56.878 --> 13:59.415
You can have your entire
wedding video a-ha'd.

13:59.714 --> 14:00.203
(PENNY LAUGHS)
Huh?

14:00.506 --> 14:01.667
A-hal

14:01.966 --> 14:02.922
Ooh! I love that.

14:11.726 --> 14:13.057
She's changing the words!
It's so good.

14:13.353 --> 14:14.969
Excuse me.

14:15.271 --> 14:16.602
Are you guys all alone
in this big wedding expo?

14:16.898 --> 14:18.263
Oh, well...

14:18.566 --> 14:20.102
Marcy Grace.
The wedding planner.

14:20.401 --> 14:21.106
The movie was
based on me.

14:21.402 --> 14:22.142
(GASPS)
Get out.

14:22.445 --> 14:23.685
(LAUGHING) Yes.

14:23.988 --> 14:25.729
Mmm, back off, poacher.
They're spoken for.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.273
Jane Kerkovich.

14:28.576 --> 14:30.066
Never heard of you.

14:30.370 --> 14:31.906
Or heard of a movie
about you. (LAUGHS)

14:32.205 --> 14:34.196
Must be an amateur.

14:34.499 --> 14:36.706
Trust me. You guys are
gonna wanna go with a pro.

14:37.001 --> 14:40.244
Uh-oh. Might wanna
add "-stitute” to that.

14:40.546 --> 14:43.789
As in, uh, "Pro-stitute."

14:44.092 --> 14:45.582
So now it's pronounced
pro-stitute?

14:45.885 --> 14:47.341
| don't know.
Maybe it is.

14:47.637 --> 14:48.752
Let's ask the crowd, huh?

14:49.055 --> 14:49.886
What?

14:51.182 --> 14:52.513
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)

14:52.809 --> 14:54.095
Nobody? All right.

14:54.394 --> 14:55.475
I'll take this.
No, no.

14:55.770 --> 14:56.851
Guys? Ladies!

14:57.146 --> 14:58.477
Give it to me!
No!

14:59.982 --> 15:01.097
Jane! Jane!
PETE: Jane.

15:01.401 --> 15:02.687
(GASPS) Jane!

15:02.985 --> 15:04.316
You're gonna need
a funeral planner!

15:04.612 --> 15:06.353
Not if you're dead first!

15:06.656 --> 15:08.272
So you wanna get
a big pretzel?

15:08.574 --> 15:10.485
Penny, this is exactly
what I'm talking about.

15:10.785 --> 15:12.367
Weddings make people
go crazy.

15:12.662 --> 15:15.495
Hey!
Watch the sweater, chiklis!

15:15.790 --> 15:18.498
No, weddings aren't crazy.
Just Jane is crazy.

15:18.793 --> 15:21.751
If having the taste to know
that beige napkins are hideous

15:22.046 --> 15:23.377
makes me a Bridezilla,
then roar!

15:23.673 --> 15:25.255
It's not about taste, okay?

15:25.550 --> 15:27.461
You're selfish,
just like at our wedding.

15:27.760 --> 15:28.465
It's always about
what you want.

15:28.761 --> 15:29.671
Aw, come on!

15:32.056 --> 15:33.592
Once again,
left at the altar.

15:33.891 --> 15:36.178
Penny... (SIGHS)

15:36.477 --> 15:37.808
We don't need
all this other stuff.

15:39.147 --> 15:40.933
All we need is this,

15:41.232 --> 15:42.188
and just you and me.

15:43.317 --> 15:43.852
Isn't that enough?

15:46.612 --> 15:48.398
Mmm... Mmm...

15:48.698 --> 15:49.438
| just...

15:50.783 --> 15:51.864
It's that...

15:53.286 --> 15:54.026
(PATS LEGS)
| guess not.

15:55.538 --> 15:56.494
(SIGHS) Oh.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.030
Pete... (SIGHS)

16:05.882 --> 16:08.123
Sorry. Can't do it.
Couples only.

16:08.426 --> 16:09.757
Don't be petty,
Manny Petty.

16:10.052 --> 16:11.258
Give me a mani.

16:11.554 --> 16:12.214
Pedi?

16:13.264 --> 16:14.129
(SIGHS)

16:15.766 --> 16:17.097
Whoa!

16:17.393 --> 16:18.849
You should've about
that couples coupon

16:19.145 --> 16:20.601
before you dumped your
fiance at a wedding expo.

16:20.897 --> 16:22.058
How could you
do that to him?

16:22.356 --> 16:23.972
Oh. No. guys,
you don't understand...

16:24.275 --> 16:25.606
And marriage is just
a piece of paper?

16:25.902 --> 16:27.188
After all that
we've fought for?

16:27.487 --> 16:28.818
You need to stand by
your man, coward.

16:29.113 --> 16:30.854
Ah. Thank you much.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.443
Lots to chew on, guys.

16:32.742 --> 16:33.903
I'm gonna go, uh, think
that over. I'm gonna...

16:34.202 --> 16:35.192
(SNEAKERS SQUEAK)
Hey-o!

16:35.495 --> 16:36.656
(GROANS)

16:36.954 --> 16:38.661
Take him back, or we're
gonna pound your ass.

16:39.415 --> 16:40.701
Wait. Uh...

16:41.000 --> 16:43.116
So you're gonna
kick my ass or...

16:43.419 --> 16:44.500
We're gonna kick your ass. Yes.

16:44.795 --> 16:45.535
Okay.
Thank God! (LAUGHS)

16:45.838 --> 16:46.919
Ooh!

16:47.215 --> 16:47.625
Wait. That's not good either.

16:49.592 --> 16:51.629
Hey, Penny, I'm just
leaving you a message

16:51.928 --> 16:54.044
since they won't
let me back in.

16:54.347 --> 16:56.179
(LOUDLY) You lightly bite
one security guard

16:56.474 --> 16:59.557
and they act like
you're a criminal.

16:59.852 --> 17:01.684
(NORMAL VOICE) Anyway, I'm sorry
that I left you hanging like that. I...

17:02.730 --> 17:04.436
Huh. Wait a minute.

17:04.732 --> 17:05.893
| just had an idea.

17:10.070 --> 17:11.277
Ah! Uh!

17:11.571 --> 17:12.277
(GASPS)

17:14.157 --> 17:17.492
| really want a wedding.
| always have.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.700
And as I got older, | started
to think that might not happen.

17:20.998 --> 17:22.079
And I think some other
people thought that, too.

17:22.375 --> 17:23.740
No...
Almost everybody.

17:24.502 --> 17:26.709
Oh. (SIGHS)

17:27.003 --> 17:28.915
[, 'm making it out
of singledom,

17:29.215 --> 17:31.252
<i>and I want witnesses
to that.</i>

17:31.551 --> 17:33.292
If a Penny gets married in a
forest, does anyone hear it?

17:33.594 --> 17:34.959
| know how you feel, Pen.

17:35.263 --> 17:37.630
| put so much into the
planning of my wedding.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.343
| obsessed
over everything,

17:39.642 --> 17:42.555
from the major decisions
down to the smallest detail...

17:42.853 --> 17:44.935
A security company made
up entirely of little people.

17:45.231 --> 17:47.188
They were very strong.

17:47.483 --> 17:48.689
So I had the wedding that
every little boy dreams of,

17:50.236 --> 17:51.522
but Alex didn't want it.

17:51.821 --> 17:53.061
And at the end of the day,

17:53.364 --> 17:54.149
she was the only thing
that should've mattered.

17:54.991 --> 17:55.651
Hmm.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.151
The wedding that
every little boy dreams of?

18:00.288 --> 18:02.370
Just let me have this.

18:02.665 --> 18:04.827
Ricky Jay was my
personal magic coach,

18:05.126 --> 18:06.958
which is a pretty big deal
in the Ricky Jay community.

18:07.253 --> 18:09.119
Hey, sweet and sour sauce.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.163
What are you doing? Get
out of here. It's not a good time.

18:11.465 --> 18:12.626
(BRAD CHUCKLES) No!

18:12.925 --> 18:14.131
(STILTED VOICE) | will
not get out of here, sir.

18:14.427 --> 18:15.667
I'm here to take back
what I said

18:15.970 --> 18:18.507
about marriage just being
a piece of paper.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.797
And... I wanna marry you

18:21.100 --> 18:22.807
because we're gay
homosexuals together.

18:23.102 --> 18:24.137
Can someone tell me
what is happening?

18:24.437 --> 18:26.053
| love you
and all your parts.

18:26.355 --> 18:27.686
They're so good.

18:27.982 --> 18:30.815
Mmm. Like your butt.
| love your butt.

18:31.110 --> 18:32.396
| love resting my head
on your butt.

18:32.695 --> 18:34.311
Is that what you think
gay guys do?

18:34.614 --> 18:35.820
We just rest our head
on each other's butts?

18:36.115 --> 18:37.196
Yeah.
Yeah.

18:37.491 --> 18:39.482
Yeah. Whatever. Can
you skedaddle, please?

18:39.785 --> 18:40.741
'Cause me and this
hot guy are about to...

18:42.371 --> 18:44.863
He's gone. Thank you. Perfect.

18:45.166 --> 18:45.826
(LOWERED VOICE) Now
hurry up and take me back

18:46.125 --> 18:46.535
before these huge guys
pound me.

18:47.918 --> 18:49.158
Trust me, they are D.T.F.

18:49.462 --> 18:49.997
Down to fight.

18:52.298 --> 18:53.163
Fine.

18:54.884 --> 18:57.376
(STILTED VOICE) of course
| take you back, Brad,

18:57.678 --> 19:00.090
because we are gay
homosexuals who are in love

19:00.389 --> 19:02.255
and will be married.
BOTH: Yay!

19:02.558 --> 19:04.219
MAN: Oh!
Let's go.

19:04.518 --> 19:06.134
(MEN CHANTING) Kiss!
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

19:06.437 --> 19:07.142
Nah, it's not like that.
Ah, no, we don't...

19:07.438 --> 19:08.644
We don't even...
No, I mean...

19:08.939 --> 19:09.974
We're more of
a behind-closed-doors type...

19:10.274 --> 19:11.139
We don't need to prove
anything. We're not...

19:11.442 --> 19:12.682
We don't like P.D.A.
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

19:12.985 --> 19:13.645
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!
MAN: You can do it!

19:13.944 --> 19:15.105
Kiss! Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

19:15.404 --> 19:16.439
BOTH: Oh!

19:18.616 --> 19:20.277
<i>AN (SHRIEKS)
Run!</i>

19:20.576 --> 19:21.657
(HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
| felt it! | felt your whiskers!

19:25.164 --> 19:26.074
I'll get married
in a forest.

19:26.791 --> 19:27.576
What?

19:29.752 --> 19:31.663
I'll elope if you want.

19:31.962 --> 19:34.670
We can go down to the
courthouse right now. Well...

19:34.965 --> 19:36.672
Well, not the one on Belmont
or the one on Michigan Ave,

19:36.967 --> 19:37.331
'cause I went through
a bailiff phase.

19:38.302 --> 19:39.633
But... (SIGHS)

19:39.929 --> 19:41.966
All that matters
is me and you.

19:42.264 --> 19:43.095
Pen, I just want you
to be happy.

19:43.391 --> 19:44.506
| just want me
to be happy, too!

19:46.894 --> 19:47.679
Then let's have a wedding.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.343
Really?

19:49.647 --> 19:52.139
The fact that you would even
consider eloping is enough for me.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.272
Aw!
Come here.

19:54.860 --> 19:56.692
Hey, Al.

19:56.987 --> 19:59.149
| found some more
wedding stuff that I like.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.940
What, a super boring eggshell
white Vera Wang aisle runner?

20:02.243 --> 20:04.826
No. I mean, I'd die...
But no.

20:05.121 --> 20:05.826
How about this?
(CHIRPING)

20:06.580 --> 20:08.537
(GASPS)

20:08.833 --> 20:10.289
For the baby animal
petting zoo I wanted!

20:10.584 --> 20:12.200
And he's in
a beige napkin.

20:12.503 --> 20:15.040
Well, it's more like
a diaper. (LAUGHS)

20:15.339 --> 20:17.125
Look, you were right.
| was a Bridezilla.

20:17.425 --> 20:18.631
And, you know,

20:18.926 --> 20:20.462
if we ever decide
to get married...

20:20.761 --> 20:23.879
Uh, to...to the idea of,
uh, throwing a formal party...

20:24.181 --> 20:25.888
Right. Like...like a black
tie Super Bowl party or...

20:26.183 --> 20:27.344
(BLOWS AIR) Yeah.
A wedding.

20:27.643 --> 20:29.429
Damn it!

20:29.729 --> 20:32.642
| wanna try to say anything
but that, but it was in my head.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.931
Well, whatever we decide
to do, we'll be in it together.

20:37.486 --> 20:38.476
So Happy Valentine's Day,
Alex.

20:41.031 --> 20:42.146
(WHEELS RATTLING)

20:42.450 --> 20:44.157
Oh, my God!

20:44.452 --> 20:45.988
Are you okay?
I'm cool.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.027
Just got my bell rung.

20:48.497 --> 20:51.080
Well... You know
what they say.

20:51.375 --> 20:52.957
It's not a good gang hang until
someone takes a major shot to the face.

20:55.337 --> 20:55.792
We should check on your
sister. Yeah, let's go look.

21:00.176 --> 21:04.044
J Take on me

21:04.346 --> 21:05.632
J Take on me
