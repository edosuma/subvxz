There is a connection between
what happened to Angela

won't tell us what it is.

12:35.212 --> 12:39.049
Imogen, are you maybe
wanting to see something
that isn't there?

13:49.954 --> 13:54.708
Female victims murdered
by masked male psychopaths.

13:54.792 --> 13:58.212
Violence perpetrated against
women's bodies by men,

13:58.295 --> 14:01.715
the foundation of almost
every horror movie.

14:01.799 --> 14:02.758
If you draw a line
backwards through time,

14:02.841 --> 14:05.886
through all the iconic
slasher movies

14:05.970 --> 14:08.639
from "Scream" to "Halloween,"
it leads you back...

14:08.722 --> 14:10.933
to the ur-killing
that started it all.

14:14.687 --> 14:16.146
The shower scene from "Psycho."

14:16.230 --> 14:18.148
I see.
So, you're going
to put yet another

14:18.232 --> 14:18.816
vulnerable young woman

14:18.899 --> 14:21.110
in Norman Bates'
crosshairs.

14:21.193 --> 14:22.903
Funny how if there's gonna
be a naked murder victim,

14:22.987 --> 14:26.240
people automatically assume
it's gonna be a woman.

14:26.323 --> 14:27.992
But we're
changing it up.

14:28.075 --> 14:31.245
Our victim will be
a vulnerable young man.

14:31.328 --> 14:33.956
Our murderer...
will be a woman.

14:34.039 --> 14:36.083
Different genders,
different power dynamics,

14:36.166 --> 14:38.168
and none of that transphobic
panic shit, either.

14:39.837 --> 14:44.091
Horror...
from the point of view
of the female gaze.

14:44.174 --> 14:46.969
♪

14:47.052 --> 14:49.430
Basically,
it's a contemporary
feminist take

14:49.513 --> 14:51.599
on the shower scene
from "Psycho."

14:51.682 --> 14:53.183
(chuckles)

14:53.267 --> 14:57.896
So, who's down to be
my modern-day Marion Crane?

14:57.980 --> 14:59.607
Baby on board.

14:59.690 --> 15:01.150
Plus, your mom's
actually gonna murder me

15:01.233 --> 15:04.445
if I don't finish
going through all
the stuff at my house.

15:04.528 --> 15:05.779
Fair... Mouse?

15:05.863 --> 15:09.491
This might be a good
time to tell you that

15:09.575 --> 15:12.411
I don't really like
horror movies. Sorry.

15:12.494 --> 15:13.537
Also fair.

15:13.871 --> 15:15.122
Noa!

15:15.205 --> 15:17.124
When and where
are you filming?

15:17.207 --> 15:18.292
The boys' locker room.
It's part of my concept.

15:18.375 --> 15:21.170
Principal Clanton
gave you permission
to do that?

15:21.253 --> 15:23.380
Nope.
We're gonna have to do it
at night and break in.

15:23.464 --> 15:26.550
Oh, a little B&E
right before getting
my monitor off?

15:26.634 --> 15:28.552
And then there was one...

15:28.636 --> 15:29.803
Faran?

15:29.887 --> 15:34.016
If I agreed...
who's the guy I'd be killing?

15:35.893 --> 15:38.646
What about
your ballet hottie?

15:38.729 --> 15:39.980
Henry?

15:40.064 --> 15:42.149
He's actually someone
I could see myself dating,

15:42.232 --> 15:46.153
so I'd rather not stab
him to death. No.

15:46.236 --> 15:47.821
Okay. Well...

15:47.905 --> 15:49.573
this short is really,
really important to me.

15:49.657 --> 15:51.700
I have to get it right.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.826
So, I need a guy who isn't shy,

15:52.910 --> 15:56.246
someone who won't balk
at being objectified.

15:57.456 --> 16:00.000
(Greg shouting)
The legend is back!

16:00.084 --> 16:01.377
Yeah, boys! What's up?

16:01.460 --> 16:03.796
Someone like?

16:05.798 --> 16:08.509
(indistinct chatter)

16:08.592 --> 16:10.010
Well, he's definitely
done grieving.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.767
Hey, Greg.
Got a second?

16:17.685 --> 16:19.645
Hayworth...

16:19.728 --> 16:23.148
What the fuck?
You made that video of Karen.

16:23.232 --> 16:24.983
And it's truly
the biggest regret
of my life.

16:27.236 --> 16:28.195
I've got a few of those.

16:28.278 --> 16:30.906
And I know she fucked
with you and your friends.

16:30.989 --> 16:31.031
She did.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.992
But still, no excuse.

16:36.412 --> 16:37.329
Look, Greg, I'm making
another video,

16:37.413 --> 16:39.915
but don't worry,
this one's fully sanctioned.

16:43.752 --> 16:45.045
Has anyone ever told you that
you look like Ryan Reynolds?

16:48.048 --> 16:51.719
I saw you today
showin' off in the cafeteria.

16:51.802 --> 16:53.220
Have you ever
thought about acting?

16:53.303 --> 16:54.722
I don't know.
What's the movie?

16:54.805 --> 16:56.348
It's for
Mr. Smithee's class.

16:56.432 --> 16:58.142
Have you ever seen
Hitchcock's "Psycho"?

16:58.225 --> 17:00.728
Girl stops at a motel,
takes a shower,

17:00.811 --> 17:03.397
guy comes in, kills her,
but I'm flipping it,

17:03.480 --> 17:05.566
and I need a guy
who's not shy,

17:05.649 --> 17:07.901
confident in his own skin.

17:07.985 --> 17:10.654
-Who else is
in the movie?
-Faran Bryant.

17:10.738 --> 17:11.822
And I kill her?

17:11.905 --> 17:14.950
No... She kills you.

17:15.033 --> 17:19.246
But basically,
it-it's a shower scene
with hot girl, right?

17:19.329 --> 17:20.831
-Mm-hm.
-Sweet.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.624
I'm in.

17:23.625 --> 17:24.668
Excellent.

17:36.346 --> 17:38.766
Nice extension.

17:42.352 --> 17:44.062
I'm sorry we have
to do this, okay?

17:46.356 --> 17:49.568
Honestly,
I have no idea why Giry
even asked me to help you.

17:50.486 --> 17:53.113
I'm not as good
of a dancer as you are.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.407
But that doesn't matter

17:55.491 --> 17:57.659
because I have
an asterisk by my name.

17:58.702 --> 18:01.288
Asterisk,
Faran Bryant,

18:01.371 --> 18:02.498
the only reason she got
cast as the Black Swan

18:02.581 --> 18:04.958
is because she's Black.

18:05.042 --> 18:08.295
At least... that's what
your sister said.

18:10.214 --> 18:11.173
But...

18:12.925 --> 18:17.471
she didn't actually
use that word,

18:17.554 --> 18:21.517
-did she?
-Wow, Kelly...

18:21.600 --> 18:24.728
I thought Karen
was the gaslighting
microaggressor,

18:24.812 --> 18:25.145
not you.

18:27.731 --> 18:29.107
That wasn't just
in my head.

18:32.277 --> 18:35.739
Now, as to why you're
coaching me...

18:35.823 --> 18:38.617
Giry also feels
sorry for you 'cause
your sister died.

18:39.743 --> 18:44.373
So, let's just get through this,
all right?

18:44.456 --> 18:46.083
Look...

18:47.501 --> 18:49.628
we don't have
to practice together.

18:51.547 --> 18:53.173
I'll just go
do my thing, and...

18:55.509 --> 18:57.553
you just be a queen, girl.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.225
You just be a queen, girl.

19:06.436 --> 19:12.234
You must be keen
to get your ankle monitor
off later this week, huh?

19:16.029 --> 19:17.072
I said, "Are you keen?"

19:18.657 --> 19:19.658
I am.

19:20.409 --> 19:21.034
Yeah, yes.

19:21.118 --> 19:24.454
But I'm not done
with you yet.

19:24.538 --> 19:27.457
If you meet
the requirements
of your probation

19:27.541 --> 19:29.793
for one year exactly,

19:29.877 --> 19:32.129
your record will
be wiped clean.

19:32.212 --> 19:34.756
Otherwise, there will

19:34.840 --> 19:37.467
be consequences.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.054
Shawn:
You've been quiet, Noa.
Everything okay?

19:41.138 --> 19:42.222
Yeah. It's just...

19:44.308 --> 19:48.020
Sheriff Beasley's
riding my ass
to the bitter end.

19:48.103 --> 19:50.105
That asshole.

19:50.188 --> 19:51.064
If he only knew
the truth, right?

19:51.148 --> 19:56.028
Shawn, don't start up
with that again, please.

19:56.111 --> 19:59.239
-You're not even
supposed to know about--
-What really happened?

19:59.323 --> 20:01.909
I'm sorry, but it's shitty that
you're dealing with any of this

20:01.992 --> 20:03.785
when the person who's
really to blame is--

20:03.869 --> 20:05.412
-(knocks on door)
-Marjorie: Hey, honey.

20:05.495 --> 20:07.164
Hey, hey, Shawn.

20:07.247 --> 20:10.918
I got off early.
Thought we could go
to a movie maybe?

20:11.001 --> 20:12.127
Shawn, you're welcome
to join us.

20:13.837 --> 20:15.422
Nah, I'm good, um.

20:15.505 --> 20:17.841
I should be
getting home anyway,
but you guys go.

20:17.925 --> 20:18.133
I'll talk to you later, babe.

20:21.345 --> 20:22.387
(grunts)

20:42.491 --> 20:44.326
(eerie music playing)

20:48.205 --> 20:50.290
-Imogen: One more game?
-Davie: Yes, but
a different one.

20:56.546 --> 20:57.798
Do you believe in ghosts?

20:57.881 --> 20:59.967
(thunder rumbles)

21:05.722 --> 21:08.141
-(knocks on door)
-Hey.

21:08.225 --> 21:11.436
Can we hang out
after school tomorrow
with the girls?

21:11.520 --> 21:13.605
A Losers Club reunion?
I'm down.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.899
We're not shooting
till Wednesday night.
What's up?

21:16.733 --> 21:18.360
I thought, maybe...

21:20.404 --> 21:22.781
we could try
to contact my mother.

21:32.749 --> 21:35.335
Hey, did you tell Kelly
that the only reason

21:35.419 --> 21:37.879
she's coaching you is
because her sister died?

21:38.797 --> 21:41.425
Why would you do that?

21:41.508 --> 21:43.802
Because, Henry,
unlike everyone else,

21:43.885 --> 21:47.222
I cannot pretend that
I suddenly like Kelly.

21:47.305 --> 21:49.182
I'm not wired that way.
Sorry.

21:49.266 --> 21:51.351
How about just having
sympathy for her?

21:51.435 --> 21:54.604
It's hard to muster sympathy
for someone coaching you

21:54.688 --> 21:56.523
when they're not
even a good dancer.

21:56.606 --> 21:57.232
I disagree.

21:57.315 --> 21:58.108
While you were
in detention,

21:58.191 --> 22:00.610
I worked
with Kelly every day

22:00.694 --> 22:03.989
and she's
gotten better.
A lot better.

22:04.072 --> 22:05.240
It's almost like
I'm dancing
with Karen again.

22:08.994 --> 22:11.246
Faran:
Like Karen? In what way?

22:11.329 --> 22:14.708
Just... can you
cut her some slack?

22:14.791 --> 22:17.627
(tense music playing)

22:38.940 --> 22:44.446
I'm sorry, Kelly,
about how I acted
at our last sesh.

22:45.655 --> 22:47.324
I was out of line, and...

22:48.992 --> 22:51.495
I'm sorry about Karen.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.538
I haven't even said
that to you yet.

22:55.874 --> 22:57.084
Thank you.

22:57.834 --> 23:00.170
I appreciate that.

23:01.838 --> 23:04.216
You must really miss her a lot.

23:05.675 --> 23:07.010
It's...

23:08.512 --> 23:10.889
hard to even think
about, honestly.

23:14.184 --> 23:16.561
I remember reading
this article

23:16.645 --> 23:18.396
about twins once
and it said that

23:18.480 --> 23:22.442
sometimes when something
bad happens to one twin,

23:22.526 --> 23:24.111
a trauma of some kind,

23:24.194 --> 23:27.906
the other one
can feel it, too.

23:27.989 --> 23:30.283
-It was a little bit
like that, yeah.
-Yeah.

23:30.367 --> 23:33.954
You'd do pretty much
anything for each other.

23:34.037 --> 23:35.956
I mean,
would've done anything

23:36.039 --> 23:38.291
back when Karen was alive.

23:38.375 --> 23:38.416
Yes.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.504
I mean...

23:42.587 --> 23:45.132
-yeah, she was my--
-Soulmate?

23:46.216 --> 23:49.094
Best friend,
I was gonna say.

23:49.177 --> 23:53.932
Yeah, that's...
her leotard you're
wearing, isn't it?

23:55.392 --> 23:57.018
Maybe we should
get started.

23:58.937 --> 24:00.272
Absolutely.

24:04.943 --> 24:08.738
Um, I guess I'll start.

24:11.908 --> 24:13.451
We're, um...

24:15.078 --> 24:18.165
gathered here to make contact

24:18.248 --> 24:21.168
with the spirit
of Davie Lee Adams...

24:22.419 --> 24:23.336
my mom.

24:26.923 --> 24:28.967
(tense music playing)

24:30.218 --> 24:31.178
Mom...

24:32.762 --> 24:34.097
it's me...

24:35.432 --> 24:35.473
Imogen.

24:38.268 --> 24:41.771
I guess what I really
want to know is...

24:44.441 --> 24:45.775
are you okay?

24:47.402 --> 24:50.488
Or... at peace?

24:55.118 --> 24:57.370
-(gasps)
-Who's moving it?

24:57.454 --> 24:59.164
-I-I'm not doing it.
-Uh, don't look at me.

24:59.247 --> 25:01.583
Everyone,
take your hands off.

25:04.628 --> 25:05.378
Mom...

25:09.674 --> 25:11.801
what happened to you?

25:13.428 --> 25:13.511
Did you...

25:15.096 --> 25:18.475
Did you die... alone?

25:20.143 --> 25:22.229
Or is there someone
else with you?

25:22.312 --> 25:24.564
Did it have something
to do with Angela Waters?

25:24.648 --> 25:25.607
Please.

25:26.441 --> 25:27.901
I need to know.

25:27.984 --> 25:29.444
There has to be
an explanation.

25:31.571 --> 25:33.031
Why would you leave me?

25:34.491 --> 25:38.703
(cries)
If you really did kill
yourself out of guilt,

25:38.787 --> 25:40.413
then you had
to have known that

25:41.748 --> 25:44.417
I'd be the one to find
you in the tub

25:44.501 --> 25:49.422
and deal with
all this bullshit.

25:50.840 --> 25:52.634
Alone.

25:54.594 --> 25:56.763
Seriously?
You have nothing to say?

25:56.846 --> 26:01.935
After everything that
you have put me through,
you abandoned me.

26:03.478 --> 26:05.355
I have no one...

26:06.439 --> 26:07.941
and nothing.

26:08.024 --> 26:10.944
Say... something.

26:13.113 --> 26:14.364
Please.

26:16.783 --> 26:19.452
It is the least
that you could do.

26:19.536 --> 26:21.454
-Imogen--
-Let her work it out.

26:24.207 --> 26:25.792
You know what, Mom?

26:28.253 --> 26:31.089
(yells)
Fuck you!

26:31.881 --> 26:33.550
I hate you!

26:33.633 --> 26:34.384
And you wanna
know what else?

26:34.467 --> 26:38.305
I'm glad that this
place is selling

26:38.388 --> 26:42.225
because I don't wanna
think about you anymore.

26:44.728 --> 26:47.314
Can we please get
the fuck out of here?
Please?

26:48.315 --> 26:49.316
Yes.

26:50.400 --> 26:52.485
But, you're wrong...

26:53.069 --> 26:55.405
about having no one.

26:55.488 --> 26:55.530
Yeah...

26:57.699 --> 26:58.283

26:58.366 --> 27:01.703
We're here for you, Imogen.

27:01.786 --> 27:04.706
For sure. We are.

27:06.916 --> 27:09.836
To quote "Chucky"...

27:09.919 --> 27:11.046
(chuckles)

27:12.297 --> 27:13.923
"Friends till the end."

27:17.594 --> 27:18.678

-(all chuckling)

27:33.568 --> 27:35.028

Sheriff?

27:35.111 --> 27:35.695
Terms of your probation

27:35.779 --> 27:37.238
allow me to make
unscheduled

27:37.322 --> 27:39.824
drop-ins and searches.

27:39.908 --> 27:41.951
Yeah,
but you haven't done
any this whole time.

27:43.203 --> 27:44.871
I'll start in
your bedroom.

27:48.541 --> 27:50.293
(tense music playing)

28:05.683 --> 28:06.559
Bathroom?

28:24.619 --> 28:25.745
-What are these?
-They're not mine.

28:28.081 --> 28:30.792
They're magnesium
to help me sleep.

28:32.669 --> 28:35.547
Oh my god. I got them
from the school nurse.
Ask her.

28:46.349 --> 28:48.518
-(sighs)
-What a psycho.

28:52.188 --> 28:53.815
What's in your bag, Mom?

28:54.941 --> 28:56.276
You using again?

28:56.359 --> 29:00.321
I sometimes
take a quarter Oxy
for my back pain

29:00.405 --> 29:01.573
but that's it.

29:10.874 --> 29:11.833
(sighs)

29:29.392 --> 29:31.853
Noa:
These aren't even yours.

29:32.896 --> 29:33.938
(door shuts)

29:37.192 --> 29:38.776
Are you excited?

29:41.070 --> 29:42.655
For what?

29:42.739 --> 29:43.990
Are you kidding?

29:44.073 --> 29:46.826
Today is your last day
wearing that ankle monitor.

29:46.910 --> 29:49.871
Um, yeah.
Guess I'll be more
excited tomorrow.

29:51.956 --> 29:54.584
Greg:
So, how do we even get
into the building tonight?

29:54.667 --> 29:57.378
Uh, me.
I'm gonna hang out
after school

29:57.462 --> 29:59.005
at the A/V studio,

29:59.088 --> 30:02.050
and then at 9:00,
I'll meet everyone
at the side door.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.177
It's a quick setup.
We should be shooting
by 10,

30:04.260 --> 30:05.261
done by midnight.

30:05.345 --> 30:06.471
And let me stress,

30:06.554 --> 30:08.139
this is a somewhat
intimate scene,

30:08.223 --> 30:09.224
so I wanna make sure
everyone feels safe

30:09.307 --> 30:11.059
and supported,

30:11.142 --> 30:12.519
and that we're in control.

30:12.602 --> 30:14.521
You've got my shot list
and the storyboards I drew,

30:14.604 --> 30:16.523
so there shouldn't
be surprises.

30:16.606 --> 30:17.774
Any questions?

30:17.857 --> 30:19.192
What are you
using for blood,

30:19.275 --> 30:19.984
and am I getting
any on me?

30:20.068 --> 30:22.362
Hm, Hitchcock used
Hershey syrup.

30:22.445 --> 30:23.863
We're using corn syrup

30:23.947 --> 30:25.281
mixed with red
food coloring,

30:25.365 --> 30:27.408
and no,
like in the original,

30:27.492 --> 30:28.535
the violence will be
implied more than shown.

30:28.618 --> 30:29.744
Too bad, 'cause
I'm always down

30:29.827 --> 30:32.580
for a meaningful exchange
of bodily fluids.

30:32.664 --> 30:35.708
Tabby:
Okay, Greg,
that is exactly

30:35.792 --> 30:37.460
the kind of bullshit
I don't wanna hear
on my set.

30:37.544 --> 30:38.586
What about our costumes?

30:38.670 --> 30:40.338
We will have them
waiting for you.

30:40.421 --> 30:42.590
Full Marion Crane.

30:42.674 --> 30:43.216
I have to wear
a costume?

30:43.299 --> 30:46.052
You're wearing a Speedo.

30:46.135 --> 30:48.596
That makes zero sense.
I wouldn't be showering
with a Speedo on.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.931
We're not gonna see the Speedo.
We're shooting around it.

30:50.014 --> 30:53.351
The nudity,
like the violence,
will be suggested.

30:53.434 --> 30:55.395
Any other questions?

30:55.478 --> 30:56.604
Yeah, in case this
turns into a porno,

30:56.688 --> 30:59.107
are you guys
providing the condoms

30:59.190 --> 31:01.276
or should I bring my own?

31:01.359 --> 31:03.236
-Oh my god.
-What the actual fuck?

31:03.319 --> 31:05.655
I'm just messin' around.
I hear you.

31:05.738 --> 31:07.532
Okay?
Safe set, promise.

you'll have them for life.

and this time
what I'm looking for

33:54.574 --> 33:55.408
I want to see it
in your eyes.

Hitchcock was all
about the eyeballs.

33:57.493 --> 34:01.330
-My intention being?
-You had dinner with Norman.

34:01.414 --> 34:03.791
You're attracted to him,
aroused by him,

34:03.875 --> 34:06.377
so in true slasher fashion,

34:06.461 --> 34:07.545
you're gonna penetrate him.

34:08.504 --> 34:10.757
Oh, with your knife.

34:12.425 --> 34:14.177
You're gonna stab him.

34:19.390 --> 34:20.975

34:45.208 --> 34:46.751
And cut!

34:46.834 --> 34:51.297
Ooh, that was awesome!
It gave me literal chills.

34:51.380 --> 34:52.965
Now, you can relax

34:53.049 --> 34:55.301
and we're gonna move on
to Greg's coverage.

34:55.384 --> 34:58.471
What am I supposed
to be doing?
Just showering?

34:58.554 --> 35:01.682
For context,
you just had dinner
with Marion.

35:01.766 --> 35:03.351
She gave you wine,

35:03.434 --> 35:06.395
but didn't have
any herself.

35:06.479 --> 35:09.816
Maybe she even
slipped something
into your drink.

35:11.734 --> 35:12.652
You're vulnerable.

35:12.735 --> 35:15.905
A damsel in distress.

35:15.988 --> 35:18.991
-Yeah, right. A damsel?
-And then, Greg, while
you were just showering,

35:19.075 --> 35:20.993
we are going to be
breaking the last taboo.

35:21.077 --> 35:22.954
-What's the last taboo?
-Oh, it's nothing bad.

35:23.037 --> 35:27.125
We're just going to show
a hot male body...

35:27.208 --> 35:28.125
namely yours...

35:28.209 --> 35:33.047
violated by
a female phallus...
Faran's!

35:33.130 --> 35:36.425

we can move to this shot

Speedo, Greg?
-(laughs)

36:24.473 --> 36:27.393
It was uncomfortable.
It was tugging at my balls.

36:27.476 --> 36:29.020
-And isn't it more
authentic this way?
-Tabby: Why do you always

36:29.103 --> 36:31.147
-have to be such
a fucking clown?
-I didn't hear you complaining

36:31.230 --> 36:32.690
when you asked me to be
in your little movie.

36:32.773 --> 36:34.275
And what the hell did
I say at our meeting?

36:34.358 --> 36:39.155
That I wanted a safe set.
You naked, not safe, not cool.

36:39.238 --> 36:40.489
Greg:
I don't mind personally,

36:40.573 --> 36:43.534
and like you said,
I'm not shy because there is

36:43.618 --> 36:44.994
-no reason to be.
-Tabby: Oh!

36:45.077 --> 36:46.579
Plus, I gave up
carbs for this, so.

36:46.662 --> 36:47.914
It's not about you!

36:47.997 --> 36:49.707
It's disrespectful
to your costar!

36:49.790 --> 36:53.002
Yo, Faran, you mind?

36:53.085 --> 36:55.004
Ballet's a lot
raunchier than this.

37:01.469 --> 37:03.304
We won't see
anything on camera.

37:03.387 --> 37:06.182
We should roll soon, though.
It's gettin' kinda late.

44:14.068 --> 44:15.986
Yeah, but what if
that wasn't Karen?

44:16.070 --> 44:19.198
What if it was...
Kelly?

44:19.281 --> 44:21.450
They switched places
and pretended to be
each other all the time.

44:21.533 --> 44:22.493
Faran, this is deranged.

44:22.576 --> 44:24.745
You're the one
who said it, Henry.

44:24.828 --> 44:26.205
"It's like dancing
with Karen."

44:26.288 --> 44:28.207
Yes, like dancing
with Karen,

44:28.290 --> 44:30.084
not actually
dancing with Karen.

44:30.167 --> 44:32.294
It's other things, too.
Little clues.

44:32.378 --> 44:34.755
But I figured out
a way to be sure.

44:34.838 --> 44:36.799
Remember the razorblades
in Karen's pointe shoes?

44:36.882 --> 44:39.051
Yeah?

44:39.134 --> 44:40.594
If I'm right,

44:40.677 --> 44:43.389
and Kelly is actually Karen,

44:43.472 --> 44:44.890
she'd have some
kind of scar.

44:44.973 --> 44:49.853
(scoffs)
And you want me to do
your dirty work and check?

44:49.937 --> 44:53.982
All you have to do
is offer to give her
a foot rub during PT.

44:54.608 --> 44:56.276
And if there's no scar?

44:57.152 --> 44:58.529
I'll let it go.

44:58.946 --> 45:00.906
Promise.

45:00.989 --> 45:02.408
(bell rings)

45:02.491 --> 45:03.033
Imogen:
I found my mom's diaries.

45:03.117 --> 45:04.618
All of them.

45:04.701 --> 45:07.704
-What do they say?
-It's what they don't say.

45:10.124 --> 45:12.418
This one's from our
moms' senior year.

45:12.501 --> 45:15.421
The entries slow down
to a trickle, then stop,

45:15.504 --> 45:17.923
-but before that--
-Some of the pages are torn out.

45:18.006 --> 45:21.969
Exactly. Why would a girl rip
out pages from her own diary?

45:22.052 --> 45:24.680
I mean, the whole point is
that it's private, right?

45:24.763 --> 45:26.598
Unless there was
something so bad

45:26.682 --> 45:30.060
she wanted to rip it
out of existence,
even for herself.

45:30.144 --> 45:32.896
And what, you think she
destroyed the pages?

45:32.980 --> 45:34.731
Or they're hidden?
Maybe somewhere in my house.

45:37.651 --> 45:40.362
Jesus,
what happened to you?

45:40.446 --> 45:41.947
Did you get your
ankle monitor off?

45:43.866 --> 45:46.118
I did this morning.

45:46.201 --> 45:47.744
(sighs) Guys...

45:51.457 --> 45:52.624
A's back.

45:53.750 --> 45:57.629
And he came after me
in person to my building.

45:57.713 --> 46:00.424
-Why you?
-Noa: According to
the text he sent,

46:00.507 --> 46:02.968
because of something
my mom did to Angela Waters.
