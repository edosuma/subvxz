00:02.961 --> 00:05.263
<i>-</i>

00:08.934 --> 00:12.370
- Hey, kids, I've got a lot
going on in my life right now.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.272
What are these "emergencies"?
Make it quick.

00:14.339 --> 00:16.441
- I've had explosive diarrhea
all morning,

00:16.508 --> 00:17.843
and I'm crapping
all over the school.

00:17.943 --> 00:19.544
- Not touching that.
Next.

00:19.644 --> 00:22.714
- I got stung by a bee,
and I can't feel my tongue.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.316
- Gonna stop ya right there.

00:24.382 --> 00:26.284
Those are all
really complex ailments.

00:26.351 --> 00:27.619
Tom, what's wrong with you?

00:27.686 --> 00:29.488
- You know,
I feel kind of sluggish.

00:29.554 --> 00:31.723
I can't tell if it's--I'm sick,
or if it's just my personality.

00:31.823 --> 00:34.559
- All right, get in here, Tom.
Let's get you taken care of.

00:34.659 --> 00:35.994
Okay, Tom,
put this in your mouth

00:36.061 --> 00:37.462
and make it seem like
I'm doing work.

00:37.529 --> 00:38.830
- Okay.

00:38.897 --> 00:40.165
- I'm actually really glad
you stopped by.

00:40.232 --> 00:41.733
You were
on my to-do list today.

00:41.833 --> 00:42.868
- Me? Why?

00:42.968 --> 00:45.237
- Because I have
an announcement!

00:46.071 --> 00:51.009
I'm getting married
to a beautiful man named Doug!

00:51.810 --> 00:53.078
- Why are you telling me?

00:53.178 --> 00:56.181
- This school is like family
to me, okay?

00:56.248 --> 00:58.750
I'm inviting all
of my favorite people.

00:58.850 --> 01:00.385
- I'm one
of your favorite people?

01:00.485 --> 01:02.554
We've literally talked twice
about Band-Aids.

01:02.654 --> 01:04.556
- And tell your Mom she's
gonna be in my bridal party.

01:04.656 --> 01:06.258
We're gonna have so much fun!

01:06.358 --> 01:08.927
- Have you guys even met?
- She's my best friend.

01:09.027 --> 01:10.996
She's being in the wedding.

01:11.062 --> 01:13.031
Oh, you're actually
really sick,

01:13.098 --> 01:15.100
but I'm not dealing with that.
See ya.

01:16.668 --> 01:18.336
- Oh wow, she really invited
the whole town.

01:18.403 --> 01:19.838
Kevork, the plumber,

01:19.905 --> 01:21.273
the guy who works at 7-Eleven,

01:21.373 --> 01:22.541
my old babysitter.

01:22.607 --> 01:24.376
- Tom, when people ask
about me,

01:24.442 --> 01:26.578
always just say, "She's busy."

01:26.678 --> 01:28.346
- I'm sorry.
I said she's wide open.

01:28.413 --> 01:30.282
- And I know that's the truth
of our lives,

01:30.382 --> 01:31.550
but don't say that.

01:31.616 --> 01:32.884
- I shouldn't have
volunteered you

01:32.951 --> 01:34.119
to be in someone's
bridal party.

01:34.219 --> 01:35.453
- How do you think I feel?

01:35.554 --> 01:36.955
I mean, I'm giving away
the bride,

01:37.055 --> 01:38.256
and I literally don't know
her last name.

01:38.356 --> 01:39.591
- I'm starting to feel
left out.

01:39.691 --> 01:41.593
Am I the only person
not invited?

01:41.693 --> 01:43.595
- Ah, no, lots of people
didn't make the cut.

01:43.695 --> 01:45.764
I mean you...
Dakota's mom...

01:45.864 --> 01:48.800
I don't think she invited
the Principal's bookie, Lou.

01:48.900 --> 01:50.068
- Nope, I'm here!

01:50.135 --> 01:51.469
I'm in charge
of pussy and booze.

01:51.570 --> 01:53.305
What do you guys need?
- Hey, Lou.

01:53.405 --> 01:55.140
- Is this all I represent
to you people?

01:55.240 --> 01:56.608
A bus driver?

01:56.708 --> 01:58.310
The guy who sits
behind the wheel

01:58.410 --> 01:59.778
and drives the bus?

02:00.579 --> 02:01.880
- Yep, yeah.

02:01.947 --> 02:03.248
- Yeah, that is the definition
of a bus driver.

02:03.315 --> 02:05.550
- Okay.
I retract the question.

02:07.319 --> 02:09.120
- Look, I got to put
this stupid dress on.

02:09.220 --> 02:12.123
I'll see you at the ceremony.
Don't talk to anyone, Tom.

02:12.223 --> 02:13.625
Let's make this
a clean in and out.

02:13.725 --> 02:14.960
- Don't talk to anyone?

02:15.060 --> 02:16.161
- Yeah, just go sit
really still

02:16.261 --> 02:17.228
in a corner of the lobby.

02:17.295 --> 02:18.430
Face a wall.

02:18.496 --> 02:19.664
- And just pretend
I can't talk?

02:19.764 --> 02:21.066
- Yeah, you know what?

02:21.132 --> 02:22.400
I'll give you a couple
of papers that say

02:22.467 --> 02:23.902
"I don't know how to talk."

02:23.969 --> 02:25.003
- All right.

02:25.103 --> 02:26.805
Not the most fun wedding,
but sure.

02:26.905 --> 02:30.575
All right, if anyone talks
to you, just "no habla ingles."

02:30.642 --> 02:32.844
- How's it going, little man?
- What are you doing here?

02:32.944 --> 02:35.080
- I'm getting married.
I'm Doug.

02:35.146 --> 02:36.348
- Oh!
She didn't say

02:36.448 --> 02:37.649
she was marrying
the ice cream man.

02:37.749 --> 02:39.017
- Well, I--I think "Doug"

02:39.117 --> 02:40.352
feels more prestigious.

02:40.452 --> 02:41.820
You know, if you tell someone,

02:41.920 --> 02:43.288
"I'm marrying
the ice cream man,"

02:43.355 --> 02:44.623
it doesn't sound
like a bright future.

02:44.689 --> 02:46.091
- So, uh... you excited?

02:46.157 --> 02:47.492
- Not at all.

02:47.592 --> 02:48.994
I feel like the walls
are closing in around me.

02:49.094 --> 02:50.629
It's like my schvanz
is in a vice

02:50.695 --> 02:52.664
and the pressure
is slowly tightening.

02:52.764 --> 02:54.866
- Doesn't sound fun at all.
- It's not fun.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.635
Hey, listen.
I need you to do me a favor.

02:56.701 --> 02:58.036
I was supposed to find
a ring bearer

02:58.136 --> 02:59.604
for this whole thing,
and I didn't.

02:59.671 --> 03:01.539
So, can you do it?
- Me?

03:01.640 --> 03:03.274
No, I promised my mom
we'd be in and out.

03:03.341 --> 03:05.543
I--I can't bear any rings.
- You owe me one.

03:05.644 --> 03:07.479
- I owe you? Why?
- You sank my truck.

03:07.545 --> 03:09.648
You know how much it cost
to dredge that thing up?

03:09.714 --> 03:11.716
- All right, I guess I owe you
on some level.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.184
- This is what you've got
to learn in life.

03:13.284 --> 03:14.386
This is good for you, actually.

03:14.486 --> 03:16.221
This is a learning situation.

03:17.889 --> 03:21.126
- That bachelor party
was off the hook!

03:21.192 --> 03:23.061
At the strip club,
when she went upside down

03:23.161 --> 03:24.462
and her hair was dragging--

03:24.529 --> 03:26.131
- Guys! Guys! Keep it clean.

03:26.197 --> 03:27.632
We got
a little fucking kid here.

03:27.699 --> 03:29.234
- Oh right.
Yeah, of course-course-course.

03:29.334 --> 03:30.702
I was saying,
I was at the strip club

03:30.802 --> 03:35.240
when that grown woman
climbed a pole,

03:35.340 --> 03:37.075
that--that was so much fun!

03:37.175 --> 03:40.245
- Yeah. She really climbed
that pole good.

03:40.345 --> 03:43.148
- That was--I'm sorry, guys.
That was the party?

03:43.214 --> 03:44.582
You watched a lady
climb a pole?

03:44.683 --> 03:46.084
- No, Tom, there's more to it.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.852
There's music,
and there's lights...

03:47.919 --> 03:49.187
- They got pretzels.

03:49.254 --> 03:50.655
- They got
little bags of chips.

03:50.722 --> 03:51.890
- Can I be honest with you?

03:51.990 --> 03:53.391
You guys' stories
are kinda boring.

03:53.491 --> 03:54.759
I might go hang out
over there with Doug.

03:54.859 --> 03:56.828
- Please go over there.

03:58.396 --> 04:00.098
Doug, you really
should start getting dressed.

04:00.198 --> 04:01.566
It's almost time.

04:01.666 --> 04:03.935
- There is a time to be born
and a time to die,

04:04.035 --> 04:06.371
a time to plant
and a time to uproot.

04:06.438 --> 04:07.706
That's from the Bible.

04:07.772 --> 04:09.774
- Are you okay, Doug?
- Not really.

04:09.874 --> 04:11.776
My life is flashing
before my eyes.

04:11.876 --> 04:14.612
I'm like a wild stallion, Tom.
I need to run free.

04:14.712 --> 04:16.047
- I'm not following.

04:16.114 --> 04:17.582
What does the stallion
have to do with anything?

04:17.682 --> 04:19.417
- I feel trapped.
I'm gonna marry this nurse

04:19.517 --> 04:21.086
and then drive
an ice cream truck

04:21.186 --> 04:22.554
the rest of my life?

04:22.620 --> 04:24.622
- Sounds amazing!
But, hey, my dad was married,

04:24.723 --> 04:25.957
and he didn't feel trapped.

04:26.057 --> 04:27.559
He just drove off
to Myrtle Beach one day.

04:27.625 --> 04:29.761
- Really? For how long?
- Just a...

04:29.861 --> 04:31.463
indefinite Myrtle Beach
excursion.

04:31.563 --> 04:32.797
- Let me get this straight.

04:32.897 --> 04:34.232
He was married
with a kid, you...

04:34.299 --> 04:35.800
- Yeah.
- And he said,

04:35.900 --> 04:37.135
"I'm driving to Myrtle Beach?"

04:37.235 --> 04:38.236
- I mean, he didn't say it
out loud.

04:38.303 --> 04:39.471
He just took off.

04:39.571 --> 04:40.772
He just left a note
on the fridge.

04:40.872 --> 04:41.906
- Your dad sounds
like a legend.

04:41.973 --> 04:43.108
- Legend?
No, no.

04:43.208 --> 04:44.442
My mom
would disagree with that.

04:44.542 --> 04:45.477
- Well, potato, pa-tot-oh.

04:45.577 --> 04:46.644
This is great advice, Tom.

04:46.745 --> 04:48.279
- Oh no, it's not "advice."

04:48.379 --> 04:50.482
- It changes my whole outlook
on the whole thing.

04:50.582 --> 04:52.150
- Okay.
Well, glad we talked.

04:52.250 --> 04:53.985
- And by the way, Tom,
you still owe me six grand

04:54.085 --> 04:55.286
for the ice cream truck.

04:55.386 --> 04:56.821
Am I ever going to see
that money?

04:56.921 --> 04:58.156
- You didn't get it?
I thought I mailed it.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.491
- You know I didn't
get it, Tom.

04:59.591 --> 05:01.159
- I clearly mailed you $6,000.

05:01.259 --> 05:03.661
- You mailed it?
You sent it through the mail?

05:06.998 --> 05:08.833
- Wow, you clean up nice.

05:08.933 --> 05:11.169
- Aw! Thank you.
So do you.

05:11.269 --> 05:12.837
- Hey, I know
I'm Tom's principal,

05:12.937 --> 05:14.606
but is it inappropriate for me
to say

05:14.672 --> 05:16.508
your tits look amazing
in that dress?

05:16.608 --> 05:18.576
- No, that's cool.
I welcome it. Thank you.

05:18.643 --> 05:20.345
- Thanks for your patience,
everyone.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.946
We will begin shortly.

05:22.013 --> 05:25.784
Unfortunately, we are
just waiting on the groom.

05:30.522 --> 05:33.625
- What's going on out there?
Is he seriously running late?

05:33.691 --> 05:35.460
- I'm sure he's milling
around somewhere.

05:35.527 --> 05:36.861
- What the F, guys?

05:36.961 --> 05:39.130
You were just with him.
Who saw him last?

05:39.197 --> 05:40.365
- I saw him.
He was talking to Tom

05:40.465 --> 05:41.866
right by the window.

05:41.966 --> 05:43.268
- Tom...
- Sorry, Mom.

05:43.334 --> 05:45.170
I didn't talk, though.
I mostly listened.

05:45.270 --> 05:47.539
- Okay.
Tom, what did he say?

05:47.639 --> 05:49.107
- Uh, just a lot
of Bible quotes.

05:49.174 --> 05:52.377
- Bible?
Like quotes about loving me?

05:52.477 --> 05:55.380
- Nah, it was about, uh, time
and, uh,

05:55.480 --> 05:57.982
a lot of doomsday talk.
Something about a stallion.

05:58.049 --> 06:00.285
- Okay, you're freaking me out.
- His schvanz in a vice.

06:00.351 --> 06:01.519
Is that from the Bible?

06:01.619 --> 06:03.154
- Oh, guys, wait.
There's a note.

06:03.221 --> 06:04.222
- A note?

06:04.322 --> 06:05.857
Let me see.
What does it say?

06:05.957 --> 06:07.725
"I'm driving down
to Myrtle Beach

06:07.826 --> 06:09.460
just like Tom's dad did."

06:09.527 --> 06:12.197
- Wait. What?
- "Thanks for the advice, Tom.

06:12.297 --> 06:14.065
You da man.
Woot, woot.

06:14.165 --> 06:18.837
the stallion rides free."
Tom, what the fuck?

06:18.903 --> 06:20.405
- I don't think people say
"what the fuck"

06:20.505 --> 06:21.673
at weddings, do they?

06:21.739 --> 06:23.007
- They do when
they're abandoned.

06:23.074 --> 06:24.576
- All right.
Let's just go dance

06:24.676 --> 06:26.578
and eat dinner.
What do you do now?

06:26.678 --> 06:29.080
- Cry.
- Let's go cry and dance.

06:33.251 --> 06:34.853
- Come on people, dance.

06:34.919 --> 06:36.988
We're only playing
jazz standards,

06:37.055 --> 06:39.657
so don't wait
for the Electric Slide

06:39.724 --> 06:44.429
or something you consider
to be fun.

06:48.700 --> 06:51.836
- Con--congratulations.
What do people say? Congrats?

06:51.903 --> 06:54.038
- Shut up!

06:54.105 --> 06:55.540
- Listen, I'm--I'm so--
I feel terrible.

06:55.607 --> 06:57.108
- You should.
- Principal, say something.

06:57.208 --> 06:58.943
- Say nothing.
Let Tom sit in the discomfort.

06:59.043 --> 07:00.278
- All right, everybody!

07:00.378 --> 07:01.946
the reception is starting,

07:02.046 --> 07:04.415
and the nurse is gonna start
by cutting the cake.

07:04.515 --> 07:06.251
Yay! Yay!...
- No, I am not!

07:06.351 --> 07:08.553
I'm not--I'm not cutting
the cake by myself.

07:08.620 --> 07:09.888
That's sad.

07:09.954 --> 07:11.256
- It's a tradition, right?
- It's fun!

07:11.356 --> 07:12.790
You cut the cake.
You eat cake.

07:12.891 --> 07:15.059
- That does sound fun.
- Okay.

07:16.861 --> 07:18.897
- Get to the part where you
smear it on your face, please.

07:18.963 --> 07:20.965
- I'm not smearing it
on my face.

07:21.065 --> 07:22.400
- Have you ever been
to a wedding?

07:22.467 --> 07:23.735
Everybody smears cake
on their face.

07:23.801 --> 07:25.069
- Well, normally there's
someone else

07:25.136 --> 07:26.371
doing the smearing!

07:26.437 --> 07:27.906
- Come on, take a deep breath.

07:27.972 --> 07:29.807
This could be the best night
of your life.

07:29.908 --> 07:32.810
- Smear it on your face!
Smear it on your face.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.545
- Mom. No. Mom. Please.
Don't chant.

07:34.612 --> 07:36.247
Smear it on your face.

07:36.314 --> 07:38.383
- Oh my God!
This is a nightmare.

07:38.449 --> 07:40.318
Fine.
Fine!

07:40.418 --> 07:41.986
- All right.
At least we're having fun now!

07:42.086 --> 07:43.554
Give her a hand.
That was--she's a good sport!

07:43.621 --> 07:45.490
She's a good sport.
- I'm not having fun!

07:45.590 --> 07:48.293
Hi, can I stick my head in?
I'm friends with everyone here.

07:48.393 --> 07:49.727
- Name.

07:49.794 --> 07:51.329
- It's probably
under "Bus Driver."

07:51.429 --> 07:53.564
- Nope.
- Try "the" bus driver.

07:53.631 --> 07:54.832
- Nope.
Under the Bs,

07:54.933 --> 07:56.234
I've got bus mechanic...

07:56.301 --> 07:58.503
- That's an insult.
- Bus dispatch guy...

07:58.603 --> 08:01.139
- Another asshole.
- Bus insurance adjuster.

08:01.239 --> 08:04.108
- Okay, prick.
- And bus door repairman.

08:04.175 --> 08:05.977
- Bus door repairman?

08:06.077 --> 08:08.313
- Yeah, he came in dancing
doing this whole thing

08:08.413 --> 08:11.182
called "the bus door."
It was pretty cool.

08:11.282 --> 08:14.619
- He's doing the bus door?
I invented the bus door!

08:14.686 --> 08:16.854
- Oh, hey, Bus Driver.
Can we talk real quick?

08:16.955 --> 08:18.356
- Sure. Yeah.
I wasn't going in anywhere.

08:18.456 --> 08:19.857
- All right, listen,

08:19.958 --> 08:21.926
I ruined the whole wedding.
It's a disaster.

08:21.993 --> 08:23.761
The groom took off.
He's heading down the turnpike

08:23.828 --> 08:25.463
in an ice cream truck.
We gotta go find him.

08:25.530 --> 08:26.864
- All right,
well, let's do this!

08:26.965 --> 08:27.932
Let's hunt it down.

08:27.999 --> 08:29.200
- Really? That's amazing.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.002
- I want to be part
of this wedding.

08:31.102 --> 08:34.172
If I got to chase down and hit
the groom's ice cream truck,

08:34.272 --> 08:35.873
I'm okay to do that.

08:36.507 --> 08:39.210
Tom, put your seatbelt on,
because we are going 90,

08:39.310 --> 08:41.879
and there is a very good chance
this does not end well.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.448
- All right, just keep
your foot on the gas.

08:43.514 --> 08:45.283
He's in a slow-moving truck.
We can catch him.

08:45.350 --> 08:49.320
- Wait, wait!
Is that him?

08:49.387 --> 08:51.055
- All right. Veer right.
We got him.

08:51.155 --> 08:55.360
- I'm veering my ass off.
- Doug, slow down.

08:55.460 --> 08:56.894
It's Tom, from the balcony.
- Ah.

08:56.995 --> 08:59.397
Hey, little man.
What's up?

08:59.497 --> 09:00.732
- Listen, you need
to reconsider.

09:00.832 --> 09:02.400
You're making
a terrible mistake.

09:02.500 --> 09:04.335
- Oh, I agree.
I should've taken the parkway.

09:04.402 --> 09:05.870
But it's too late.
I can't turn around.

09:05.970 --> 09:07.405
- No, it's not the mistake
I'm talking about.

09:07.505 --> 09:09.407
I'm talking about
the wedding you bailed on.

09:09.507 --> 09:10.808
- Nah, too late for that.

09:10.875 --> 09:13.077
I already said
"the stallion rides free."

09:13.177 --> 09:14.912
It'd be embarrassing
to just go back now.

09:15.013 --> 09:17.415
- Doug, that is not a good
reason to not get married.

09:17.515 --> 09:19.751
- When you grow up, you realize
you make life decisions

09:19.851 --> 09:21.085
on a lot of stupid things.

09:23.521 --> 09:26.090
- Remember that time we went
to an Italian restaurant

09:26.190 --> 09:27.425
and then screwed on my couch?

09:27.525 --> 09:28.860
- I do.
That was fun.

09:28.926 --> 09:30.495
Remember the time
we went to the concert,

09:30.561 --> 09:31.829
and we threw churros at people,

09:31.896 --> 09:33.431
and you hit that guy
in the eye?

09:33.531 --> 09:35.066
- That might have been
the best night of my life.

09:35.166 --> 09:37.001
And I don't know if you
remember this, Principal,

09:37.068 --> 09:38.436
but I have a son.

09:38.536 --> 09:39.937
- Where is Tom, by the way?
I haven't seen him?

09:40.038 --> 09:42.006
- I'm sure
he's around here somewhere.

09:42.073 --> 09:44.175
I try not to be
a "helicopter mom,"

09:44.242 --> 09:46.010
as they say.

09:46.077 --> 09:47.412
- All right, come on,
get me closer.

09:47.512 --> 09:48.413
I'm going in.

09:48.513 --> 09:49.680
- This goes against

09:49.747 --> 09:51.582
almost all
my bus driver training.

09:53.684 --> 09:55.953
- Oh, that's dangerous.
- Look at you.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.188
Does this look like a man

09:57.255 --> 09:58.456
who's making
the right decision?

09:58.556 --> 10:00.024
- Absolutely not.

10:00.091 --> 10:01.592
- I just think you seem to like
the nurse on some level.

10:01.692 --> 10:03.027
- I do.

10:03.094 --> 10:04.462
- You probably don't have
many options out there.

10:04.562 --> 10:06.130
- I don't.

10:06.230 --> 10:07.732
- I can't imagine you're gonna
be a big hit in Myrtle Beach.

10:07.799 --> 10:09.300
- Probably not.

10:09.400 --> 10:10.802
- All things considered,
I think you should turn around.

10:10.902 --> 10:12.804
- Wow.
You are a wise little man.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.939
- All right, let's--
let's go back and get married.

10:15.039 --> 10:16.240
Oh, hey, Bus Driver,
we're all good here.

10:16.307 --> 10:17.642
You can go home.

10:17.742 --> 10:19.377
- Who's that idiot?
Did we invite him?

10:19.444 --> 10:21.312
- I've actually been meaning
to talk to you about that.

10:21.412 --> 10:23.047
There must have been
a mix-up with the invites--

10:23.114 --> 10:25.216
- No time to talk.
Let's turn this thing around

10:25.283 --> 10:26.551
so I can get married.

10:26.617 --> 10:28.586
The stallion turns back.

10:29.153 --> 10:32.090
- You're very easily swayed.
Did anyone ever tell you that?

10:37.228 --> 10:40.331
- It really wasn't that bad.
- Actually, arguably,

10:40.431 --> 10:43.434
this is the worst thing that
could happen at a wedding.

10:43.501 --> 10:46.404
- Hello everyone!
Hey! I have an announcement.

10:46.471 --> 10:48.339
I tracked down
the ice cream man.

10:48.439 --> 10:49.674
The wedding's back on.

10:49.774 --> 10:53.311
- Doug?
Oh my God, thank you, Tom!

10:53.411 --> 10:55.813
Doug, come on out here.

10:55.913 --> 10:58.950
- Oh, bad news, guys.
He left a note...

10:59.016 --> 11:00.418
- More notes? Come on.

11:00.485 --> 11:02.687
"Sorry, Nurse, I bailed again.

11:02.787 --> 11:06.090
"The half-hour alone in the car
with Tom made me realize

11:06.157 --> 11:10.361
"I don't want to have kids.
He's got a lot of problems.

11:10.461 --> 11:13.631
The stallion rides free.
Woot, woot."

11:16.334 --> 11:19.470
- Woot, woot!

11:19.537 --> 11:21.105
- Way to go, Tom.

11:21.172 --> 11:22.540
- Are all weddings
this stressful?

11:22.640 --> 11:24.976
Because I'm not
enjoying myself at all.
