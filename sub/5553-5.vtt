WEBVTT

00:03.313 --> 00:05.647
Hey, ready for lunch?
Oh, one sec.

00:05.649 --> 00:09.084
Is that the prototype drive
system for the high-G rover?

00:09.086 --> 00:11.453
No, Bernadette
got me a Fitbit

00:11.455 --> 00:14.490
so she can track
how much I'm exercising.

00:15.825 --> 00:19.094
That'll teach her to care
about your health.

00:19.096 --> 00:22.865
I can't wait to see the look
on her face when I die young.

00:23.967 --> 00:25.367
When was the last actual
exercise you got?

00:25.369 --> 00:26.735
The other day, when

00:26.737 --> 00:30.172
she tried to put that Fitbit
on me and I ran away from her.

00:31.040 --> 00:32.641
According to a recent study,

00:32.643 --> 00:35.410
simply thinking about exercise,
even while sitting still,

00:35.412 --> 00:36.778
can have physical benefits.

00:36.780 --> 00:39.381
For all you know,
I could be exercising right now.

00:39.383 --> 00:42.284
Are you?
Eh, I'll do it tomorrow.

00:43.186 --> 00:44.486
It wouldn't be the worst thing

00:44.488 --> 00:45.654
if we were more active.

00:45.656 --> 00:48.056
Oh. You make
an excellent point.

00:51.227 --> 00:53.929
Ooh, I think
I'm getting a runner's high!

01:23.914 --> 01:26.146
Look at all these activities
the university has.

01:26.147 --> 01:29.181
Rock climbing club,
archery, flag football.

01:29.183 --> 01:32.518
Had me at flag,
lost me at football.

01:32.520 --> 01:35.154
Yeah, I think it's great you
guys want to get more exercise,

01:35.156 --> 01:38.090
but do you really think sports
is the right choice for you?

01:38.092 --> 01:40.058
What are you saying?
We're not coordinated enough

01:40.060 --> 01:41.159
to play sports?

01:41.161 --> 01:43.562
Okay, Leonard, sweetheart,

01:43.564 --> 01:46.865
you twisted your ankle
playing <i> Scrabble.</i>

01:47.700 --> 01:49.701
I got a triple-word score

01:49.703 --> 01:51.370
with a double letter "Q."
If that's not a time

01:51.372 --> 01:54.272
to bust out the <i> Scrabble</i> dance,
what's the point of having one?

01:56.175 --> 02:00.011
Hey, Barry Kripke
started a fencing club.

02:00.013 --> 02:03.982
Interesting. Sword fighting does
hold a certain elegant appeal.

02:03.984 --> 02:05.817
And I would imagine
it meets many

02:05.819 --> 02:08.453
of our personal criteria
for a sport.

02:08.455 --> 02:10.788
It's indoors, so no sunscreen.

02:11.457 --> 02:12.457
No throwing, no catching,

02:12.459 --> 02:14.259
no running.

02:14.261 --> 02:17.229
No gym shorts
that can be yanked down.

02:18.397 --> 02:19.598
Or worse, up.

02:19.600 --> 02:21.399
Preach.

02:21.401 --> 02:22.734
And as
an added bonus,

02:22.736 --> 02:24.469
the word "touché" comes
from fencing.

02:24.471 --> 02:26.504
It would be our only opportunity
to use it

02:26.506 --> 02:29.240
in a non-metaphorical sense.

02:29.242 --> 02:31.409
What about a game of tag
on a French schoolyard?

02:31.411 --> 02:33.311
Ah, touché.

02:36.048 --> 02:37.315
Thanks for coming by.

02:37.317 --> 02:39.017
Sure. So how can we help?

02:39.019 --> 02:41.186
Well, I know
more women are

02:41.188 --> 02:42.987
buying comics than ever,
but for some reason,

02:42.989 --> 02:44.856
I-I can't get
'em in here.

02:44.858 --> 02:46.891
All right, well,
what have you tried so far?

02:46.893 --> 02:50.495
Uh, I've-I've been stocking
more female-oriented titles.

02:50.497 --> 02:53.765
Uh, in the bathroom, I folded
the end of the toilet paper

02:53.767 --> 02:55.033
into a triangle.

02:55.035 --> 02:56.367
And,
uh,

02:56.369 --> 02:58.236
you are now sitting
in the official

02:58.238 --> 03:00.471
breastfeeding area.

03:02.741 --> 03:05.810
Really? In a comic book store?
Oh,

03:05.812 --> 03:08.079
don't worry. I-I've got
a camera right up here,

03:08.081 --> 03:10.648
so I could watch
from the counter

03:10.650 --> 03:14.151
and make sure guys
aren't being pervs.

03:18.624 --> 03:19.757
Anyway,

03:19.759 --> 03:21.592
so what do I got to do to-to

03:21.594 --> 03:22.827
get you in
the door?

03:22.829 --> 03:24.562
Well, for starters,

03:24.564 --> 03:26.864
you might want to rethink
some of this artwork.

03:26.866 --> 03:31.235
I mean, this woman's
actually on a leash like a dog.

03:31.237 --> 03:34.038
Well, you don't know
the backstory.

03:34.040 --> 03:37.108
Maybe she kept jumping up
on the couch.

03:39.000 --> 03:45.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:50.055 --> 03:52.056
I feel cool.

03:52.058 --> 03:55.559
Like Puss in Boots.

03:55.561 --> 03:58.380
I always wanted to be
a swashbuckler when I was a kid.

03:58.404 --> 03:59.097
Technically,

03:59.098 --> 04:01.265
"swashbuckler" is a combination
of two terms.

04:01.267 --> 04:03.867
"Swash" referring to the sound
of the sword.

04:03.869 --> 04:05.903
Swash.

04:06.838 --> 04:08.272
And
then

04:08.274 --> 04:11.441
"buckler" meaning a small
shield, which you don't have.

04:11.443 --> 04:13.043
We can still be swashers.
Hmm.

04:13.045 --> 04:15.045
Well said, Puss.

04:16.346 --> 04:20.684
Gentlemen, welcome
to the fencing club.

04:20.685 --> 04:24.521
Before we start, I just want to
warn you, fencing isn't a joke.

04:24.523 --> 04:26.323
I hope you're not here because
you think it's going to be

04:26.325 --> 04:28.258
like <i> Star Wars.</i>

04:28.260 --> 04:29.159
That's not why we're here.

04:29.161 --> 04:30.360
Yeah, I'm here
because I think

04:30.362 --> 04:32.195
it's gonna be like
<i>Game of Thrones.</i>

04:32.197 --> 04:34.564
And maybe
a little <i> Princess Bride.</i>

04:34.566 --> 04:36.366
Ooh, ooh! I forgot
about <i> Princess Bride!</i>

04:36.368 --> 04:38.902
That's my answer!

04:38.904 --> 04:43.139
Well, sorry to disappoint you,
but fencing is a serious sport.

04:43.141 --> 04:44.174
If you're not willing
to put in the effort,

04:44.176 --> 04:46.276
you might as well just leave
now.

04:46.278 --> 04:48.511
We're not afraid of physical activity.
Yeah.

04:48.513 --> 04:51.114
I already ran 18 miles today.

04:52.216 --> 04:54.818
All right. Let's begin
with some fundamentals.

04:54.820 --> 04:57.153
This is the en
garde position.

04:57.155 --> 05:00.123
Feet are in an "L."
Heels in a straight line.

05:00.125 --> 05:01.091
Elbow is
about a fist

05:01.093 --> 05:02.692
from the rib cage.

05:02.694 --> 05:05.728
Notice my dominant
leg faces forward.

05:05.730 --> 05:06.763
Oh, dear.

05:06.765 --> 05:08.064
What's wrong, Cooper?

05:08.066 --> 05:11.468
Well, I'm not sure
I have a dominant leg.

05:11.470 --> 05:13.369
They're both pretty submissive.

05:15.773 --> 05:17.173
When you're in a
public restroom,

05:17.175 --> 05:19.576
which foot do you
flush the toilet with?

05:21.612 --> 05:23.947
Right. Always right.

05:23.949 --> 05:25.248
He's a righty.

05:25.250 --> 05:27.817
Okay,

05:27.819 --> 05:28.918
show me en garde.

05:28.920 --> 05:31.254
Good. Knees bent,

05:31.256 --> 05:32.922
slightly over the toe.

05:32.924 --> 05:35.625
Non-sword hand up for balance.

05:35.627 --> 05:39.595
(groans) I am going
to feel this tomorrow.

05:39.597 --> 05:42.799
The first move
is called an advance.

05:42.801 --> 05:45.268
You move your front foot
forward, heel to toe.

05:45.270 --> 05:47.270
Back foot
follows.

05:47.272 --> 05:49.672
So front foot forward,
heel to toe.

05:49.674 --> 05:51.407
Back foot follows.

05:51.409 --> 05:54.076
Now you try. Advance.

05:54.078 --> 05:57.647
And advance.
And advance.

05:57.649 --> 06:01.017
This is easy.
I didn't need to wear a cup.

06:01.019 --> 06:02.051
KRIPKE:
Good.

06:02.053 --> 06:03.819
The next move is called
a retreat.

06:03.821 --> 06:04.920
Step back.

06:04.922 --> 06:06.922
Back foot first, toe to heel.

06:06.924 --> 06:08.591
Front foot follows.

06:08.593 --> 06:10.226
On three.

06:10.228 --> 06:11.460
Excuse me, Barry?
Yes.

06:11.462 --> 06:13.829
When can I stab
one of my friends?

06:14.965 --> 06:16.699
In fencing,
we don't call it a stab.

06:16.701 --> 06:18.467
We call it a touch.
Uh, yes, I'm aware.

06:18.469 --> 06:20.336
But if I say I want
to touch one of my friends,

06:20.338 --> 06:23.372
I'll get called
into Human Resources.

06:23.374 --> 06:24.840
Okay, on three,

06:24.842 --> 06:28.310
Cooper and Koothrappali advance,
the other two retreat.

06:28.312 --> 06:31.980
One, two, three.

06:31.982 --> 06:33.682
Very good. Switch it up.

06:33.684 --> 06:35.651
One, two, three.

06:35.653 --> 06:38.287
Switch again.
One, two, three.

06:38.289 --> 06:40.656
(phone rings)
(groans)

06:40.658 --> 06:42.324
Excuse me.

06:42.326 --> 06:44.092
Can I call you back?

06:44.094 --> 06:47.663
No, I'm teaching
a class.

06:47.665 --> 06:50.299
Sure.
Sure.

06:50.301 --> 06:52.534
An hour,
tops.

06:52.536 --> 06:53.969
Yeah. Okay.

06:53.971 --> 06:56.038
Okay.
Yeah.

06:56.040 --> 06:58.006
Okay. Thanks.

06:58.008 --> 07:01.877
And one,
two, three.

07:03.046 --> 07:06.481
Have you thought about
advertising directly to females?

07:06.483 --> 07:08.483
Hmm, okay.

07:08.485 --> 07:10.218
Well... All right.

07:10.220 --> 07:13.255
What if I put up a sign
in the window that said,

07:13.257 --> 07:16.091
"Women, come in.

07:16.093 --> 07:19.594
Don't be afraid."

07:22.198 --> 07:24.399
PENNY:
Hey.

07:24.401 --> 07:26.534
Uh, have you read the online
reviews for this place?

07:26.536 --> 07:27.569
Eh,

07:27.571 --> 07:28.536
the Internet's so negative.

07:28.538 --> 07:30.071
I try to avoid it.

07:30.073 --> 07:31.306
All right, well,
Heather H. says,

07:31.308 --> 07:33.208
"The owner stared at me
the whole time

07:33.210 --> 07:35.844
and didn't blink once."

07:44.253 --> 07:45.987
Kelly M. says,

07:45.989 --> 07:48.623
"The creepy guy who runs it
asked me out,

07:48.625 --> 07:52.193
then called himself stupid
before I could say no."

07:53.229 --> 07:56.130
Jessica K.
says,

07:56.132 --> 07:58.566
"I told the weird owner
that I liked his shirt.

07:58.568 --> 08:02.303
He took it off
and gave it to me."

08:02.305 --> 08:06.107
See? Negative.

08:08.410 --> 08:10.011
With your foil extended,

08:10.013 --> 08:13.114
kick your front leg up and
push off with your back leg.

08:13.116 --> 08:14.882
Now you try.

08:15.651 --> 08:18.319
And
again.

08:18.321 --> 08:21.222
And again.

08:21.224 --> 08:24.392
Look at us! We're
like the Rockettes!

08:25.193 --> 08:26.961
En garde,
Leonard.

08:26.963 --> 08:30.264
Prepare yourself
for a rigorous touching.

08:33.168 --> 08:35.035
(Spanish accent):
My name is Inigo Montoya.

08:35.038 --> 08:36.904
You killed my father.

08:36.905 --> 08:38.472
Prepare to die.

08:38.474 --> 08:40.140
(Spanish accent):
<i>My</i> name

08:40.143 --> 08:41.174
is Inigo Montoya.

08:41.177 --> 08:43.611
You killed <i> my</i>
father. Prepare

08:43.613 --> 08:45.212
to die.

08:45.214 --> 08:47.548
I thought
you were Puss in Boots.

08:47.550 --> 08:48.782
Oh, yeah, right. Sorry.

08:48.784 --> 08:50.918
(Spanish accent):
My name is Puss in Boots.

08:50.920 --> 08:52.686
You killed my father.

08:52.688 --> 08:54.421
Prepare to die.

08:56.625 --> 08:59.660
I'm looking forward to him
teaching us glove-slapping.

08:59.662 --> 09:01.462
What?

09:01.464 --> 09:04.031
You know, when my
honor is insulted,

09:04.033 --> 09:06.166
and I need to challenge
someone to a duel

09:06.168 --> 09:10.003
by slapping them across
the face with my glove.

09:10.005 --> 09:11.371
When was your honor insulted?

09:11.373 --> 09:14.975
My last physical.

09:14.977 --> 09:17.311
Again, that doctor
didn't insult your honor.

09:17.313 --> 09:19.480
Just checked your prostate.

09:20.949 --> 09:24.084
My name is Little
Orphan Annie.

09:24.086 --> 09:25.953
You killed my father.

09:25.955 --> 09:28.322
Prepare to die.

09:30.425 --> 09:33.560
(with accent):
My name is Darth Vader.

09:33.562 --> 09:36.663
I <i> am</i> your father. Ah!

09:38.366 --> 09:40.667
This is fun.
Good.

09:40.669 --> 09:42.702
It's nice
to see your mind off Amy.

09:42.704 --> 09:44.137
What's going on with Amy?

09:44.139 --> 09:45.806
Not that it's any
of your business,

09:45.808 --> 09:47.207
but she broke up with me.

09:47.209 --> 09:48.708
Really?

09:48.710 --> 09:50.410
Good to know.

09:52.380 --> 09:54.381
"Good to know"?

09:54.383 --> 09:56.216
What's that supposed to mean?
Oh.

09:56.218 --> 09:59.419
I hate to say it, but it sounds
like he's interested in her.

09:59.421 --> 10:02.455
Well, that's unacceptable.

10:02.457 --> 10:04.624
Oh, buddy, I get
that you don't like it,

10:04.626 --> 10:06.459
but it's not
really up to you.

10:06.461 --> 10:09.629
Yeah, but he's dumb,
and his face is dumb.

10:09.631 --> 10:12.899
Look, even if it's not him,

10:12.901 --> 10:16.402
Amy's probably going
to date someone at some point.

10:16.404 --> 10:18.037
You really think so?

10:18.039 --> 10:20.707
Of course.
She deserves to be happy.

10:20.709 --> 10:23.476
How dare you!

10:33.098 --> 10:34.732
Listen, I should warn you

10:34.734 --> 10:38.569
that maybe asking Amy out
isn't a good idea.

10:38.571 --> 10:39.970
Barry, a word?

10:39.972 --> 10:42.573
And now the crazy version
of what I just said.

10:44.276 --> 10:45.543
If you intend to pursue Amy,

10:45.545 --> 10:48.312
you leave me with no choice
but to put a stop to it.

10:48.314 --> 10:51.048
And how are you gonna do that?

10:51.050 --> 10:52.750
By challenging you to a duel.

10:53.785 --> 10:56.854
You've had one lesson.
I'll destroy you.

10:56.856 --> 10:59.023
That is why
the duel will take place

10:59.025 --> 11:01.992
at high noon,
three years from today.

11:03.561 --> 11:05.396
If you're worth your salt
as an instructor,

11:05.398 --> 11:06.630
I should be ready by then.

11:06.632 --> 11:08.699
Yeah, and be warned.

11:08.701 --> 11:10.734
I'm going to touch you all over.

11:13.104 --> 11:18.408
Wow. That-that was crazier
than I thought.

11:19.544 --> 11:22.412
All right,
I'm not saying

11:22.414 --> 11:24.815
it's true, but let's-let's
consider for a moment

11:24.817 --> 11:27.284
that possibly I'm the problem.
Yeah.

11:27.286 --> 11:28.552
You are.
You can say it.

11:28.554 --> 11:30.120
Okay, fine. What...?

11:30.122 --> 11:31.655
I mean, what
can I do?

11:31.657 --> 11:33.457
I get so nervous
around women.

11:33.459 --> 11:34.925
Well, you're talking
to us now.

11:34.927 --> 11:36.360
I mean, you don't seem nervous.

11:36.362 --> 11:37.961
Well, that's
'cause I'm doing that trick

11:37.963 --> 11:40.597
where you imagine
the audience is naked.

11:42.667 --> 11:45.202
By the way, thumbs up, ladies.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.772
Do you not hear
how creepy that sounds?

11:48.774 --> 11:50.707
(laughing):
It was a joke.

11:50.709 --> 11:51.875
Was it?

11:51.877 --> 11:53.677
No, I'm still doing it.

11:53.679 --> 11:56.580
Okay.

11:56.582 --> 11:58.548
Don't be offended, but...

11:58.550 --> 12:00.884
what went wrong with you?

12:00.886 --> 12:05.422
I-I guess I assumed
at this point in my life,

12:05.424 --> 12:08.558
I would be married
or in a relationship,

12:08.560 --> 12:09.993
or even have a pet

12:09.995 --> 12:12.695
that didn't run away
or kill itself.

12:13.564 --> 12:15.465
That really happened?

12:15.467 --> 12:17.801
I mean, I can't say for sure,
but I swear

12:17.803 --> 12:19.669
that rabbit looked me
right in the eye

12:19.671 --> 12:21.804
before it hopped
in front of that car.

12:21.806 --> 12:23.673
Anyway,

12:23.675 --> 12:25.909
the longer I'm alone,
the more desperate I get.

12:25.911 --> 12:31.347
Stuart, believe it or not,
I understand.

12:31.349 --> 12:32.882
You know, before I met Sheldon,

12:32.884 --> 12:35.518
I was alone
for a really long time.

12:35.520 --> 12:37.420
I was so desperate

12:37.422 --> 12:39.789
for people to like me,
when I met these guys,

12:39.791 --> 12:43.059
it took everything in my power
to hide my insecurity.

12:46.063 --> 12:48.197
(laughing):
Okay, we're all feeling it.

12:48.199 --> 12:50.433
Yes, I'll go out with you.

12:53.704 --> 12:56.973
Suddenly, the rabbit thing
makes sense.

12:59.610 --> 13:02.511
I'm surprised you wanted to go
to a sports bar, Sheldon.

13:02.513 --> 13:04.981
Look at this blister.

13:04.983 --> 13:07.483
Like it or not,
we're athletes now.

13:07.485 --> 13:10.720
Besides, a bar is
where I belong.

13:10.722 --> 13:12.922
I'm having female problems.

13:12.924 --> 13:15.724
If you're cranky and retaining
water, I have a theory.

13:17.060 --> 13:19.929
Sheldon, instead of focusing
on Amy dating other guys,

13:19.931 --> 13:22.464
maybe you should start thinking
about dating another girl.

13:22.466 --> 13:24.633
That's ridiculous.

13:24.635 --> 13:25.935
KOOTHRAPPALI:
Why? You never thought

13:25.937 --> 13:27.202
you'd end up in a relationship,

13:27.204 --> 13:28.370
and then you met Amy.

13:28.372 --> 13:29.838
Maybe there's someone else
out there for you.

13:29.840 --> 13:33.976
True, but Penny's married,
and so is Bernadette.

13:35.178 --> 13:37.379
And your girlfriend has
red hair and white skin,

13:37.381 --> 13:40.549
which really rubs up
against my clown phobia.

13:41.851 --> 13:43.452
Maybe you should consider women

13:43.454 --> 13:44.820
who aren't
in serious relationships

13:44.822 --> 13:46.388
with your closest friends?

13:46.390 --> 13:49.925
There's that prostate doctor,
but I'm still mad at her.

13:52.128 --> 13:53.729
Oh, there's a woman.

13:53.731 --> 13:55.130
Oh, I'll make her my girlfriend.

13:55.132 --> 13:57.799
Whoa, whoa.

13:57.801 --> 14:01.937
Walking up to a strange woman
in a bar usually doesn't work.

14:01.939 --> 14:03.839
You're forgetting something.

14:03.841 --> 14:05.407
Ladies love jocks.

14:06.309 --> 14:08.577
How many sips
of that beer did he have?

14:08.579 --> 14:10.445
Three.
Oh, boy.

14:12.081 --> 14:16.852
Excuse me. I'm recovering
from a recent breakup,

14:16.854 --> 14:20.655
and I'm told asking out another
woman might make me feel better.

14:20.657 --> 14:24.860
And as Ash Ketchum said
to Pikachu, "I choose you."

14:24.862 --> 14:26.828
What?

14:26.830 --> 14:28.997
It's a <i> Pokémon</i> reference.

14:28.999 --> 14:30.699
I don't know what that means.

14:30.701 --> 14:32.834
Well, we gave it a shot.

14:33.502 --> 14:36.237
How about you?

14:36.239 --> 14:39.441
I'm married,
and I'm her grandmother.

14:39.443 --> 14:42.277
Ah, what might have been.

14:42.279 --> 14:46.347
And you, give my regards
to Barnum and Bailey.

14:49.485 --> 14:52.821
Stuart took that rejection
like a pro.

14:52.823 --> 14:55.690
Well, he knew
he was on the breast cam.

14:57.593 --> 15:00.328
I don't have much practice
turning men down.

15:00.330 --> 15:01.863
It wasn't so much fun.

15:01.865 --> 15:03.197
Oh, you get used to it.

15:03.199 --> 15:05.466
Some guys you have
to turn down over and over.

15:05.468 --> 15:08.169
And sometimes
we marry them anyway.

15:08.171 --> 15:10.171
(phone chimes)

15:10.173 --> 15:12.407
Huh.

15:12.409 --> 15:14.642
Well, this is weird.

15:14.644 --> 15:17.712
What?
Barry Kripke just asked me out.

15:17.714 --> 15:19.080
(gasps)
BERNADETTE: Oh.

15:19.082 --> 15:21.449
Look at you--
two guys in one day!

15:21.451 --> 15:25.186
I told you things would change
if you plucked your eyebrows!

15:26.622 --> 15:28.356
What did he say?

15:28.358 --> 15:30.825
"Hi, how are you?
I was wondering

15:30.827 --> 15:33.761
if you'd like to get a drink
after work sometime."

15:33.763 --> 15:35.396
Well, what are
you gonna do?

15:35.398 --> 15:37.298
I don't know.

15:37.300 --> 15:40.368
I guess I assumed that I would
eventually date other people,

15:40.370 --> 15:42.603
but this is happening so fast.

15:42.605 --> 15:44.205
What can it hurt?

15:44.207 --> 15:46.207
Well, I was hoping the
next person I dated

15:46.209 --> 15:48.175
would be a little
less like Sheldon.

15:48.177 --> 15:49.877
You mean, not a scientist?

15:49.879 --> 15:51.946
I think she means not a weirdo.

15:53.181 --> 15:54.582
Are you attracted
to him?

15:54.584 --> 15:56.817
I don't know.

15:56.819 --> 15:59.620
All right, well, what happens
if you imagine him naked?

15:59.622 --> 16:00.821
Oh, I don't have to imagine it.

16:00.823 --> 16:03.223
(gasps)

16:08.463 --> 16:10.331
I smell funny.

16:12.167 --> 16:14.435
I taste salty.

16:14.437 --> 16:17.504
You're just sweaty
from exercise.

16:17.506 --> 16:19.006
And kind of delicious.

16:20.909 --> 16:24.444
I wonder how many licks it would
take to get to the center of me.

16:27.282 --> 16:29.750
I know it only takes
one doctor's finger.

16:32.687 --> 16:34.121
Hello.

16:34.123 --> 16:35.789
Hello.

16:35.791 --> 16:37.391
We should let
you guys talk.

16:37.393 --> 16:38.325
Yeah.

16:38.327 --> 16:39.626
You don't have to leave.

16:39.628 --> 16:41.461
Look at me go!

16:43.464 --> 16:44.765
Uh, Bernadette,
you're my ride.

16:44.767 --> 16:46.032
BERNADETTE:
Walk!

16:50.271 --> 16:52.672
How have you been?

16:52.674 --> 16:54.641
I'm doing all right.

16:54.643 --> 16:56.977
I tried fencing today.

16:56.979 --> 16:58.778
How'd that go?

16:58.780 --> 17:01.414
It was pretty easy.

17:01.416 --> 17:03.984
And I think my background
in "mathletics" helped.

17:05.653 --> 17:07.954
Barry Kripke was there.

17:07.955 --> 17:09.222
I should let you know

17:09.223 --> 17:12.157
that he expressed interest
in asking you out.

17:13.361 --> 17:15.060
Well, actually,
he-he already did.

17:15.063 --> 17:17.030
Okay.

17:17.031 --> 17:18.798
But don't get
too attached to him.

17:18.800 --> 17:21.935
In two years, 364 days,
he's a dead man.

17:25.239 --> 17:26.573
I said no.

17:26.575 --> 17:28.174
Interesting.

17:28.175 --> 17:32.345
I asked two women out today,
and they both said no.

17:32.347 --> 17:35.748
I didn't know you
were interested in dating.

17:35.750 --> 17:39.018
I've been told
it's a good way to move on.

17:39.020 --> 17:41.354
Oh.

17:41.356 --> 17:43.222
Okay.

17:45.693 --> 17:49.395
Anyway, um,
it's nice to see you.

17:49.397 --> 17:50.997
You look good.

17:50.999 --> 17:51.998
Mmm, thanks.

17:52.000 --> 17:53.399
And I taste good too.

18:05.070 --> 18:07.305
Howie?

18:07.555 --> 18:09.122
What's up?

18:09.959 --> 18:12.760
Why does your Fitbit say
you ran 174 miles yesterday?

18:16.659 --> 18:23.159
