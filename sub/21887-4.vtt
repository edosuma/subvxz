WEBVTT

00:01.046 --> 00:02.890
Previously on Gotham...

00:02.893 --> 00:05.500
Jim, meet my daughter, Sofia.

00:05.503 --> 00:07.217
Do you ever think about
walking away from it all?

00:07.219 --> 00:08.351
Sometimes.

00:09.948 --> 00:11.581
This drawing depicts a man

00:11.584 --> 00:14.091
being healed by water.

00:14.094 --> 00:16.338
That's Ra's al Ghul.

00:16.341 --> 00:18.795
He wants the knife.

00:18.798 --> 00:21.577
Opening bid will begin at $50,000.

00:21.579 --> 00:23.746
A hundred thousand dollars.

00:23.748 --> 00:25.359
$2 million!

00:26.393 --> 00:28.518
Sold to Mr. Bruce Wayne!

00:30.522 --> 00:31.721
I guess you could say

00:31.723 --> 00:33.055
I'm your number one fan.

00:33.057 --> 00:35.358
What's black and white and red all over?

00:35.360 --> 00:37.226
Zebra with a gaping hole.

00:37.228 --> 00:39.896
I think something is
wrong with your brain, Ed.

00:39.898 --> 00:41.898
Gordon, you got a visitor.

00:41.900 --> 00:44.033
- You shouldn't have come back here.
- I'm a Falcone.

00:44.035 --> 00:46.860
You came looking for a gangster;
that's exactly what you found.

00:46.863 --> 00:49.238
That knife is the key

00:49.240 --> 00:50.240
to everything.

00:52.665 --> 00:54.777
Well, not everything.

01:04.656 --> 01:06.295
Mmm...

01:06.298 --> 01:07.623
Beautiful.

01:07.625 --> 01:09.258
And you bought this at auction?

01:09.260 --> 01:11.127
Supposedly, it was the embalming knife

01:11.129 --> 01:13.296
of the first century Mesopotamian king.

01:13.298 --> 01:14.931
- Balahsi.
- Ah.

01:14.933 --> 01:17.733
And what is it that you
want of me, Mr. Wayne?

01:17.735 --> 01:19.469
Anything you can tell me, Dr. Winthrop.

01:19.471 --> 01:21.504
I want to know exactly
what it is I bought.

01:21.506 --> 01:23.272
Perhaps you should have considered that

01:23.274 --> 01:25.274
before you dropped $2
million on it, shouldn't you?

01:25.276 --> 01:27.143
Leave it with me overnight.

01:28.947 --> 01:30.913
I'm back.

01:30.915 --> 01:33.316
Man, you really need

01:33.318 --> 01:34.617
to clean that room.

01:34.619 --> 01:36.649
My delightful grandson.

01:36.652 --> 01:37.696
I have access

01:37.699 --> 01:40.189
to the very clean
historical records room

01:40.191 --> 01:42.196
at Gotham Central Library,

01:42.199 --> 01:44.299
and he uses it for his homework.

01:44.302 --> 01:46.338
Oh, Alex, let me introduce you.

01:46.341 --> 01:48.966
Mr. Bruce Wayne and his guardian,

01:48.969 --> 01:51.200
- Alfred Pennyworth.
- What's up?

01:52.586 --> 01:53.585
Whoa.

01:53.588 --> 01:55.421
Where'd that come from?

01:55.424 --> 01:58.025
That cuneiform is
definitely pre-Phoenician.

01:58.028 --> 02:00.486
Alex is an avid student

02:00.489 --> 02:02.979
of history, and sometimes assists me.

02:02.981 --> 02:05.147
A word, Master Bruce.

02:05.149 --> 02:07.183
Now, it's all very well

02:07.185 --> 02:09.417
involving that old
geezer, but a young man?

02:09.419 --> 02:11.214
Just you remember
who's after that knife.

02:11.217 --> 02:12.388
What's so important about it

02:12.390 --> 02:16.626
that Ra's al Ghul wants it
so badly? We need to know.

02:16.628 --> 02:18.494
Dr. Winthrop.

02:18.496 --> 02:20.162
Alex.

02:21.799 --> 02:24.500
I have to ask you to keep
this matter between us.

02:24.502 --> 02:25.902
Of course.

02:25.904 --> 02:28.004
Yeah. Cool.

02:28.006 --> 02:29.672
I mean...

02:29.674 --> 02:31.340
yes, Mr. Wayne.

02:31.342 --> 02:33.175
I'll check back tomorrow.

02:33.178 --> 02:35.012
Until then.

02:40.485 --> 02:42.318
No!

02:43.988 --> 02:46.188
Come on, Ed, come on.

02:46.190 --> 02:48.057
You can do it.

02:49.761 --> 02:51.761
This has to be...

02:51.763 --> 02:54.096
the perfect... riddle.

02:54.098 --> 02:55.598
No!

03:01.239 --> 03:03.203
Yes.

03:03.341 --> 03:04.774
Yes.

03:05.843 --> 03:08.335
Yes! Yes!

03:11.082 --> 03:12.708
You...

03:21.292 --> 03:24.226
Tomorrow night, Oswald,

03:24.228 --> 03:26.854
is the night you die.

03:38.509 --> 03:42.177
Alex, bring me the Palmerian Codex.

03:46.050 --> 03:47.216
Ah.

03:52.390 --> 03:53.756
Ah.

03:53.758 --> 03:55.700
What is it?

04:00.398 --> 04:03.232
"he who rises from the waters,

04:03.234 --> 04:05.334
whom death shall not touch.

04:05.336 --> 04:07.336
With this sacred blade,

04:07.338 --> 04:09.929
his final savage destiny

04:09.932 --> 04:11.807
shall be fulfilled.

04:11.809 --> 04:13.676
The earth will quake.

04:13.678 --> 04:15.578
Blood will flow.

04:15.580 --> 04:17.512
All tremble...

04:18.783 --> 04:20.874
before the Demon's Head."

04:20.877 --> 04:23.519
What's the Demon's Head?

04:23.521 --> 04:27.323
Not what, my boy. Who.

04:27.325 --> 04:30.222
There is a legend in
the time of this knife

04:30.225 --> 04:32.495
of a man who could not die.

04:32.497 --> 04:34.630
Or who died but was reborn.

04:34.632 --> 04:37.099
Have you ever in your
reading come across the name,

04:37.101 --> 04:38.707
Ra's al Ghul?

04:38.710 --> 04:40.770
He was a warlord.

04:40.772 --> 04:44.306
But those guys always had
stories invented about them.

04:44.308 --> 04:45.708
They're just stories.

04:45.710 --> 04:48.878
My boy, people believe in these stories.

04:48.880 --> 04:50.798
They kill for them.

04:52.316 --> 04:54.550
I think Bruce Wayne has stumbled across

04:54.552 --> 04:57.386
something much more
complex than he imagined,

04:57.388 --> 04:59.722
and infinitely more dangerous.

05:03.127 --> 05:05.494
No one should be here.

05:05.496 --> 05:08.464
Here. Take this into my office.

05:08.466 --> 05:09.665
Stay quiet.

05:09.667 --> 05:11.067
Quickly.

05:17.542 --> 05:19.809
Dr. Niles Winthrop. What a pleasure.

05:19.811 --> 05:22.011
Who are you?

05:22.013 --> 05:23.846
Museum's closed.

05:23.848 --> 05:25.548
How did you get past the guard?

05:25.550 --> 05:27.349
My apologies.

05:27.351 --> 05:29.351
But my business is pressing.

05:29.353 --> 05:32.067
Greek vase, second century.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.154
Oh.

05:34.726 --> 05:37.827
This was made by a forger in
Marrakesh in the 15th century.

05:37.829 --> 05:41.430
He had some talent, but
told the most obscene jokes.

05:42.366 --> 05:45.310
Tell me who you are, or
I shall call the police.

05:45.313 --> 05:47.002
I'm looking for a knife

05:47.004 --> 05:49.605
Bruce Wayne brought you earlier today.

05:49.607 --> 05:52.041
I don't know what you mean.

05:52.043 --> 05:56.779
Hmm. The best liar I ever
met ran a brothel in Shanghai.

05:56.781 --> 05:59.973
Her quite considerable
gift was that you knew

05:59.976 --> 06:01.437
she was lying but didn't care,

06:01.440 --> 06:04.754
you so badly wanted to believe her.

06:06.023 --> 06:09.925
You, Dr. Winthrop, are a terrible liar.

06:12.045 --> 06:13.729
Where's the knife?

06:16.425 --> 06:19.201
Oh, the-the police, they're coming.

06:19.203 --> 06:21.871
I imagine they are.

06:56.514 --> 06:58.179
End of crime, my ass.

06:58.182 --> 07:00.659
Harper? Where's Bullock?

07:00.662 --> 07:02.003
He asked me to fill in.

07:02.006 --> 07:04.747
He took a sabbatical for a few days.

07:04.749 --> 07:07.118
You babysitting me?

07:07.121 --> 07:08.818
Do you need babysitting?

07:08.820 --> 07:10.550
What do we got?

07:10.553 --> 07:12.097
Dr. Niles Winthrop.

07:12.100 --> 07:13.994
Curator of antiquities.

07:13.997 --> 07:15.930
Looks like somebody snapped his neck.

07:15.933 --> 07:17.593
No witnesses, of course.

07:17.595 --> 07:19.161
Fire alarm triggered security.

07:19.163 --> 07:21.759
Maybe the dead guy pulled
it right before the...

07:21.762 --> 07:24.133
Yeah, thanks. Anything else?

07:24.135 --> 07:25.768
Yes, actually.

07:25.770 --> 07:28.543
According to Professor
Von Dead's logbook,

07:28.546 --> 07:29.872
the last person who visited him...

07:29.874 --> 07:31.602
I'm talking just yesterday afternoon...

07:31.605 --> 07:33.375
Bruce Wayne.

07:33.377 --> 07:35.544
It's all right. Let him in.

07:37.777 --> 07:39.114
Detective Gordon.

07:39.116 --> 07:40.282
What...

07:44.722 --> 07:46.655
What happened?

07:46.657 --> 07:49.058
We were thinking we would
ask you the same thing.

07:49.060 --> 07:51.861
You met with Dr. Winthrop
just yesterday, correct?

07:51.863 --> 07:53.996
I, um...

07:53.998 --> 07:56.365
I-I bought an old knife at auction.

07:56.367 --> 07:59.001
Dr. Winthrop agreed
to examine it for me.

07:59.003 --> 08:00.754
I was coming by

08:00.757 --> 08:02.530
to check on his progress.

08:02.533 --> 08:04.673
- When was he killed?
- According to the fire alarm,

08:04.675 --> 08:06.041
just past midnight.

08:06.043 --> 08:08.699
Whoever did it must have
slipped past security.

08:08.702 --> 08:10.701
His grandson.

08:10.704 --> 08:12.595
Alex. He's my age, a little bit younger.

08:12.598 --> 08:14.984
- Have you talked to him?
- No one's seen any kid.

08:14.986 --> 08:16.151
I'll get on it.

08:21.692 --> 08:23.726
Where's the knife?

08:23.728 --> 08:26.154
Alfred was right... I
shouldn't have left it.

08:26.157 --> 08:28.931
Bruce, slow down.

08:28.933 --> 08:30.099
What's this knife?

08:30.101 --> 08:31.861
You think someone would
actually kill for it?

08:33.504 --> 08:36.089
Detective Gordon, I'll tell
you what you want to know,

08:36.092 --> 08:38.419
but all I ask is that
you let me come along.

08:38.423 --> 08:40.604
If this is because of the
knife, then I'm responsible.

08:40.607 --> 08:41.873
Bruce, a man is dead.

08:41.876 --> 08:43.529
A child is potentially missing.

08:43.532 --> 08:45.114
This is not time to play detective.

08:45.116 --> 08:46.548
What do you know?

08:46.550 --> 08:48.784
What's so special about this knife?

08:48.786 --> 08:52.721
As far as I know, it's
just an old knife. But...

08:52.723 --> 08:55.024
I paid a great deal for it,
and there was another bidder,

08:55.026 --> 08:56.258
a very aggressive one.

08:56.260 --> 08:57.927
Barbara Kean.

08:59.797 --> 09:01.697
Right.

09:01.699 --> 09:04.618
Well, Harper will
track down the grandson.

09:04.621 --> 09:06.415
I'll deal with Barbara.

09:06.418 --> 09:07.803
You go home.

09:07.805 --> 09:09.738
I'll call you when I need you.

09:11.976 --> 09:13.742
♪ ♪

09:22.219 --> 09:24.920
You're here, finally.

09:24.922 --> 09:26.922
I've kept you waiting.

09:26.924 --> 09:29.224
Apologies.

09:29.226 --> 09:31.260
I see my guests have arrived.

09:31.262 --> 09:33.128
Oh, yeah.

09:33.130 --> 09:37.308
Got to say, they don't do
much for the vibe of the place.

09:37.311 --> 09:40.602
If you had acquired the knife
when I first requested it,

09:40.605 --> 09:42.340
they wouldn't be necessary.

09:44.942 --> 09:48.077
What's so special about
this knife, anyway?

09:48.079 --> 09:50.112
Sentimental value?

09:50.114 --> 09:53.482
Only a destiny born of blood and magic

09:53.484 --> 09:56.151
2,000 years in the making.

09:56.153 --> 09:57.920
Uh-huh.

09:57.922 --> 10:00.549
Now Dog-Boy here is gonna fetch it...

10:03.477 --> 10:06.528
His name is Anubis.

10:10.134 --> 10:11.367
And yes.

10:13.938 --> 10:16.138
Bring me the knife.

10:16.140 --> 10:17.673
And you...

10:17.675 --> 10:19.011
can kill the boy.

10:36.766 --> 10:37.865
Boss.

10:37.867 --> 10:40.935
Knocking, Victor. We discussed this.

10:40.937 --> 10:42.503
Uh-huh.

10:42.505 --> 10:43.938
She's here.

10:45.008 --> 10:46.441
Show her in.

10:49.179 --> 10:50.753
Ms. Falcone,

10:50.756 --> 10:52.680
welcome to Gotham.

10:52.682 --> 10:54.715
Mr. Cobblepot, it's a
pleasure to meet you.

10:54.717 --> 10:56.047
Call me Oswald.

10:57.826 --> 10:59.153
Please, have a seat.

10:59.156 --> 11:00.141
Thank you

11:00.144 --> 11:01.789
for coming to see me.

11:01.791 --> 11:03.691
I learned from my father,

11:03.693 --> 11:05.960
when the king of Gotham
summons you, you come.

11:05.962 --> 11:07.528
And how is Carmine?

11:07.530 --> 11:09.730
Can we hope to see him sometime soon?

11:11.122 --> 11:13.367
Shall we just address
the elephant in the room?

11:13.369 --> 11:15.033
By all means.

11:15.036 --> 11:16.279
My father's

11:16.282 --> 11:19.525
illegal businesses
hold no interest for me.

11:19.528 --> 11:22.262
I'm here because the Falcone
family has a number of charities

11:22.265 --> 11:23.697
that need my attention.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.379
And you can only provide that attention

11:25.381 --> 11:27.771
by being here personally... in my city.

11:27.774 --> 11:29.085
I understand your concern...

11:29.088 --> 11:30.585
Oh, do you?

11:32.422 --> 11:36.657
But I assure you... it's unfounded.

11:36.659 --> 11:40.728
You know, your father
taught me many things.

11:40.730 --> 11:44.999
Among them was to nurture
a healthy paranoia.

11:45.001 --> 11:47.502
For example, when I took over,

11:47.504 --> 11:50.061
some of his old capos went underground.

11:50.064 --> 11:54.385
Now, perhaps they've vanished for good,

11:54.388 --> 11:56.755
or perhaps they're waiting
for a Falcone to return

11:56.758 --> 11:58.224
to lead the rebellion.

11:58.227 --> 12:00.518
Uh... Who knows?

12:01.997 --> 12:05.803
But I hear your father's voice

12:05.806 --> 12:09.775
whispering in my ear.

12:09.778 --> 12:11.807
"Be careful."

12:15.031 --> 12:17.400
Now... I need to know

12:17.402 --> 12:19.502
that you are not on some fool's errand

12:19.504 --> 12:21.804
to rebuild your father's empire.

12:21.806 --> 12:24.473
Otherwise...

12:24.475 --> 12:26.542
I'm gonna stab you.

12:33.271 --> 12:36.018
I was 13 when my father
first sent me away.

12:37.488 --> 12:39.855
He said that Gotham was too dangerous.

12:41.259 --> 12:42.725
This is my home.

12:42.727 --> 12:44.260
I wanted to come home.

12:44.262 --> 12:46.595
That's why I'm here.

12:46.597 --> 12:48.197
Is that enough?

12:52.297 --> 12:54.003
Gotham.

12:54.005 --> 12:56.405
Mother to us all.

12:57.775 --> 12:59.909
I think we have nothing to worry about.

12:59.911 --> 13:02.445
Give your father my best, will you?

13:18.890 --> 13:20.221
Jim.

13:20.224 --> 13:22.625
What a lovely surprise.

13:23.534 --> 13:26.902
Barbara.

13:26.904 --> 13:28.437
I heard you popped up.

13:28.439 --> 13:30.806
Seems like you landed
on your feet as usual.

13:30.808 --> 13:32.274
Hmm.

13:32.276 --> 13:35.077
A woman has to stay busy.

13:35.079 --> 13:37.213
You seem different.

13:37.215 --> 13:40.583
You like this me better?

13:40.585 --> 13:42.585
You recently bid on a knife at auction.

13:42.587 --> 13:43.986
Hmm.

13:43.988 --> 13:45.559
So much for catching up.

13:45.562 --> 13:48.557
The knife is now missing and
the person who had it is dead.

13:48.559 --> 13:51.093
What were you doing last
night around midnight?

13:51.095 --> 13:54.463
I was here... with witnesses.

13:54.465 --> 13:55.965

A client.

14:06.244 --> 14:08.511
And no, though tempting,

14:08.513 --> 14:10.479
I can't give you the name.

14:58.574 --> 15:00.396
You're lying. Again.

15:02.636 --> 15:05.137
Ra's al Ghul is the real
leader of the Court of Owls.

15:05.140 --> 15:06.835
He is the one responsible for the virus

15:06.837 --> 15:08.237
and having me kidnapped.

15:10.007 --> 15:12.474
And you didn't think to
mention any of this before?

15:15.379 --> 15:17.379
Why would he want the knife, huh?

15:17.381 --> 15:19.214
What's so important about it?

15:19.216 --> 15:20.524
I have no clue.

15:20.527 --> 15:22.318
That's what I've been
trying to find out.

15:23.988 --> 15:25.610
Yeah.

15:25.613 --> 15:27.081
Gordon, the kid's not at home.

15:27.083 --> 15:28.408
Apparently, Granddad
was looking after him

15:28.410 --> 15:29.843
while the parents were traveling.

15:29.846 --> 15:31.430
He's not at school. No one's seen him.

15:31.433 --> 15:33.829
Great. Listen, I need
all the info you can get

15:33.832 --> 15:35.735
on a man named Ra's al Ghul.

15:35.738 --> 15:37.032
He could be connected.

15:37.035 --> 15:39.868
Sure. But how do you spell...?

15:39.870 --> 15:41.774
No one's seen the boy.

15:41.777 --> 15:43.176
He's either hiding,

15:43.179 --> 15:45.341
or the man who killed
his grandfather has him.

15:45.343 --> 15:48.577
Police were triggered by
a fire alarm at the museum.

15:48.579 --> 15:51.751
Alex could've pulled
it, taken the knife.

15:51.754 --> 15:53.129
If so, he'd be hiding,

15:53.132 --> 15:54.683
scared.

15:54.685 --> 15:56.085
Where could he be?

15:56.087 --> 15:57.286
Think.

15:57.288 --> 15:58.887
I only met him for a second.

15:58.889 --> 16:01.223
You want to play detective?
Now is your chance.

16:01.225 --> 16:03.392
What was he wearing? What
did he say? Give me anything.

16:03.394 --> 16:05.761
He... had on his school uniform.

16:05.763 --> 16:08.564
He just came from studying at...

16:08.566 --> 16:12.230
Gotham Central Library. His
grandfather had a room there.

16:12.233 --> 16:13.556
Alex has a key.

16:13.559 --> 16:16.372
If he's hiding, he's made a
choice not to trust the cops.

16:16.374 --> 16:18.073
If I show up, he might run.

16:18.075 --> 16:21.210
He needs to see a
face he knows. Come on.

16:23.881 --> 16:25.748
Ed Nygma sent you?

16:25.750 --> 16:27.650

'em to tell us where Nygma is.

17:01.008 --> 17:02.655
No, he just found us on the street.

17:02.665 --> 17:04.145
Well, that's exactly what you would say.

17:04.146 --> 17:06.155
Leave!

17:06.156 --> 17:09.692
That barmaid who kidnapped
Ed said he'd lost a step.

17:09.694 --> 17:12.327
Clearly, she was mistaken, he's
up to all of his old tricks.

17:12.329 --> 17:15.364
So, I'll meet him.

17:15.366 --> 17:18.099
You and your men will hide nearby.

17:18.102 --> 17:19.667
Attack when I say.

17:19.670 --> 17:21.704
Do not kill Ed, though!

17:21.707 --> 17:23.991
I want Victor to freeze him again.

17:23.993 --> 17:26.309
- Huh?
- Not you. The other Victor.

17:26.311 --> 17:27.608
Oh.

17:27.611 --> 17:31.513
Earth meets sky, water flows, birds fly.

17:32.783 --> 17:34.783
Obviously, he means the pier.

17:34.785 --> 17:37.486
Gather your men.

17:37.488 --> 17:39.855
I want Ed Nygma.

17:41.125 --> 17:42.702
Historical Records room?

17:42.705 --> 17:44.129
In the back.

18:00.661 --> 18:02.177
Alex?

18:02.179 --> 18:04.146
It's me, Bruce Wayne.

18:06.058 --> 18:08.325
You can come out. It's safe.

18:08.328 --> 18:10.421
Alex, please. I...

18:10.424 --> 18:12.002
I just want to help you.

18:18.155 --> 18:21.323
Alex, this is Detective Gordon.

18:21.326 --> 18:22.492
You can trust him.

18:24.434 --> 18:26.468
Okay. Okay, all right.

18:32.576 --> 18:34.510
I'm so sorry.

18:36.614 --> 18:38.614
That-that-that man, he killed him.

18:38.616 --> 18:40.415
- He killed my grandfather.
- It was a man?

18:40.417 --> 18:42.217
- You saw his face?
- I only saw him

18:42.219 --> 18:43.828
from behind. It was the knife.

18:43.831 --> 18:45.854
Did-did you know it was dangerous?

18:47.244 --> 18:48.624
No.

18:48.626 --> 18:50.125
I had no idea.

18:50.127 --> 18:52.580
Alex, we need to get
you down to the station.

18:52.583 --> 18:55.346
I-I-I can't. That man,
he'll think I saw him.

18:55.349 --> 18:57.558
- He'll come after me.
- I will protect you.

18:57.561 --> 18:59.968
- I promise.
- He'll keep coming till he gets the knife.

19:01.983 --> 19:03.915
Alex, do you have the knife with you?

19:03.918 --> 19:05.541
No. I hid it.

19:11.782 --> 19:14.883
Take Alex and meet
me at the station. Go.

19:35.673 --> 19:38.841
Who sent you?

19:38.843 --> 19:40.843
Thanks for clearing that up.

19:52.590 --> 19:55.290
Bruce? Run!

20:20.853 --> 20:24.028
- Bruce Wayne call in?
- No. We released a citywide BOLO.

20:24.031 --> 20:25.464
What about that name I gave you?

20:25.467 --> 20:29.033
Zip. I tried Richard
Gull, Ralph Ghoul...

20:29.036 --> 20:31.438
Detective Gordon?

20:32.742 --> 20:34.942
Ra's al Ghul.

20:34.944 --> 20:37.878
Minister of Antiquities
attached to the consulate

20:37.880 --> 20:39.713
of Nanda Parbat.

20:41.516 --> 20:43.616
Thanks for coming in.

20:43.619 --> 20:45.885
Nanda Parbat, that's
in the Himalayas, right?

20:45.888 --> 20:47.207
Well done, Detective.

20:47.210 --> 20:50.090
Few in your country have
even heard of our tiny nation.

20:51.445 --> 20:53.345
Why don't we speak in
my captain's office?

20:53.348 --> 20:54.863
A bit more private.

20:54.866 --> 20:57.231
Of course.

20:57.233 --> 20:58.522
I'll be with you in a minute.

20:58.525 --> 21:00.425
Thank you.

21:03.939 --> 21:05.739
I don't get it. This is the guy that

21:05.741 --> 21:07.933
you're looking at for murder?
Why does he just walk in?

21:07.936 --> 21:09.743
Barbara must have told him
we were looking for him.

21:09.745 --> 21:11.814
- Yeah, but...
- Two thugs at the library.

21:11.817 --> 21:13.250
If they're working for him,

21:13.253 --> 21:16.417
they would have told him
that we've contacted Alex.

21:16.419 --> 21:18.786
He could think that
Alex gave us the knife.

21:20.456 --> 21:22.156
I can use that.

21:24.160 --> 21:28.248
Call Alfred Pennyworth, see
if he's heard from Bruce Wayne.

21:28.251 --> 21:29.984
Th-That thing bit me.

21:31.272 --> 21:33.206
- I need to get you to a hospital.
- No, no.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.136
Then the police. Detective Gordon...

21:35.139 --> 21:36.972
No, I can't. I can't. They'll find me.

21:36.974 --> 21:39.675
I'm sorry.

21:39.677 --> 21:41.643
I'm scared.

21:43.647 --> 21:46.481
I don't know how you do it.

21:46.483 --> 21:50.074
You fought those men, and I...

21:50.077 --> 21:52.044
I just froze.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.934
Same as when that man
killed my grandfather.

21:58.609 --> 22:00.509
Fear is normal.

22:02.017 --> 22:05.986
In the alley, when my
parents were killed...

22:05.989 --> 22:09.991
I was terrified.

22:09.994 --> 22:12.079
I just stood there.

22:15.479 --> 22:17.767
There's nothing wrong with being afraid.

22:17.770 --> 22:19.284
Once you realize it's normal,

22:19.287 --> 22:21.087
then you can put it in its place.

22:21.090 --> 22:23.858
Then you can act.

22:25.616 --> 22:26.782
Fight back.

22:36.345 --> 22:40.069
I felt bad for you.

22:40.072 --> 22:42.772
When that happened to your parents.

22:42.774 --> 22:45.809
You were all the kids
at school talked about.

22:45.811 --> 22:48.578
What do they say?

22:48.580 --> 22:50.881
That you live alone in a mansion.

22:50.883 --> 22:52.782
Don't go to school.

22:52.784 --> 22:54.951
Fly around in jets.

22:54.953 --> 22:57.287
They make you sound weird.

22:57.289 --> 22:58.955
Maybe I am.

22:58.957 --> 23:00.259
No.

23:00.262 --> 23:01.862
You're-you're cool.

23:01.865 --> 23:03.231
I'm weird.

23:05.329 --> 23:09.415
And you're a little weird, too, I guess,

23:09.418 --> 23:11.718
but...

23:11.721 --> 23:14.388
you're weirdly cool.

23:23.682 --> 23:25.541
I'll take you to the knife.

23:27.908 --> 23:29.107
Can I get you anything?

23:29.110 --> 23:30.419
Coffee?

23:30.422 --> 23:31.588
That won't be necessary.

23:31.590 --> 23:33.023
I think you know why I'm here.

23:33.025 --> 23:34.457
Enlighten me, Minister.

23:34.459 --> 23:35.992
Barbara Kean,

23:35.995 --> 23:38.860
with whom you spoke, was acting
on behalf of my government

23:38.863 --> 23:41.195
to procure a certain property.

23:42.314 --> 23:45.749
Said property is the cultural
patrimony of my people.

23:45.752 --> 23:47.680
Why not bid on the knife yourself?

23:47.683 --> 23:49.940
There were competing claims.

23:49.942 --> 23:52.876
And if we'd bid officially,
alarms may have sound,

23:52.878 --> 23:56.713
and so it seemed
better to do it quietly.

23:56.715 --> 23:58.128
But...

23:58.131 --> 24:01.985
Ms. Kean... failed.

24:01.987 --> 24:04.387
And now, regrettably,

24:04.389 --> 24:06.658
I understand there's been a murder?

24:06.661 --> 24:08.358
Dr. Niles Winthrop,

24:08.360 --> 24:10.460
curator at the Gotham
Natural History Museum.

24:10.462 --> 24:12.662
That's awful.

24:12.664 --> 24:15.182
But the reason I'm here, Detective,

24:15.185 --> 24:18.557
is to press my claim on
behalf of my government,

24:18.560 --> 24:21.828
and entreat you to
return the knife to me.

24:21.831 --> 24:24.140
You say this knife is
important to your country,

24:24.142 --> 24:25.542
please explain.

24:25.544 --> 24:27.577
Hmm.

24:27.579 --> 24:30.981
There is an ancient
story amongst my people

24:30.983 --> 24:33.383
of a man...

24:33.385 --> 24:36.463
who could not die.

24:36.466 --> 24:39.066
In his time, he committed terrible acts,

24:39.069 --> 24:42.057
raised a great kingdom,

24:42.060 --> 24:44.260
and then vanished.

24:44.262 --> 24:46.029
What happened to him?

24:46.031 --> 24:47.831
If the legend is to be believed,

24:47.833 --> 24:50.197
he walked away from his
throne vowing that one day

24:50.200 --> 24:52.197
he would return and
complete his destiny,

24:52.200 --> 24:56.106
but that would require
a particular knife.

24:56.108 --> 24:58.074
This knife.

24:58.076 --> 25:01.244
A story, as I said.

25:01.246 --> 25:03.580
But to my people...

25:03.582 --> 25:06.249
very meaningful.

25:07.768 --> 25:10.068
I hope that satisfies your curiosity.

25:10.071 --> 25:12.288
Some.

25:12.290 --> 25:15.332
But you see, Minister,

25:15.335 --> 25:18.670
my chief concern,

25:18.673 --> 25:21.907
is there's a boy, the
grandson of the curator.

25:21.910 --> 25:24.868
He's being hunted.

25:24.870 --> 25:27.270
Now, perhaps that's
because of the knife.

25:27.272 --> 25:30.076
Or perhaps the killer thinks

25:30.079 --> 25:33.476
he saw something.

25:33.478 --> 25:35.145
Did he?

25:35.147 --> 25:37.747
No.

25:37.749 --> 25:40.705
Well, then he's safe.

25:40.708 --> 25:41.763
Yes, but you see,

25:41.766 --> 25:43.632
I would have to know that for certain,

25:43.635 --> 25:46.221
before I would do anything
that might affect the case,

25:46.224 --> 25:47.824
such as release the knife.

25:49.113 --> 25:52.448
May I see the knife, Detective?

25:52.451 --> 25:55.396
It would so set my mind at ease.

26:01.006 --> 26:02.806
Hey.

26:02.808 --> 26:04.340
Where the bloody hell is Gordon?!

26:04.342 --> 26:05.672
Gordon. Incoming.

26:05.675 --> 26:07.942
Gordon! Where the hell is Bruce?

26:07.945 --> 26:09.311
You...

26:09.314 --> 26:10.480
Alfred!

26:10.482 --> 26:11.848
- Wait, wait, wait!
- Back off!

26:11.850 --> 26:13.016
Take your hands off of me.

26:13.019 --> 26:14.686
You don't know what you got in there!

26:14.689 --> 26:16.488
I'm starting to, but
you are not helping.

26:16.491 --> 26:17.791
I need you to calm down.

26:17.794 --> 26:19.126
Let me finish talking to him.

26:19.129 --> 26:20.805
- Gordon.
- Not now.

26:20.808 --> 26:22.359
Gordon!

26:26.418 --> 26:28.018
He's bloody vanished.

26:28.021 --> 26:30.467
He knows we don't have the knife.

26:30.469 --> 26:32.769
We have to find Bruce.

26:32.771 --> 26:34.056
Donna Falcone.

26:34.059 --> 26:35.189
Do not call me that.

26:35.192 --> 26:37.392
- You got to hear us out.
- No, I don't.

26:37.395 --> 26:38.697
I didn't invite you here.

26:38.700 --> 26:40.099
We're not having this meeting.

26:40.102 --> 26:41.669
Now, I'm gonna ask you, please,

26:41.672 --> 26:43.171
politely, to leave.

26:43.174 --> 26:45.117
We served your father for years.

26:45.119 --> 26:47.286
When Penguin took over,
we had to go underground.

26:47.288 --> 26:48.588
Then we heard a Falcone

26:48.590 --> 26:50.298
was back in Gotham.

26:50.301 --> 26:51.800
We knew it was time.

26:51.803 --> 26:54.359
Did you ignore my father
like you're ignoring me?

26:54.362 --> 26:56.195
I just told you to leave.

26:56.197 --> 26:58.385
Just tell us when your
father's coming back

26:58.388 --> 26:59.872
to put that Penguin in his place.

26:59.875 --> 27:02.783
Please understand me, my
father is not coming back.

27:02.786 --> 27:04.070
This is Penguin's city.

27:04.072 --> 27:06.354
And I want you to leave before
he finds out you're here...

27:06.357 --> 27:08.333
Too late, I'm afraid.

27:10.144 --> 27:11.944
Victor, how many graves did you dig?

27:11.946 --> 27:13.479
Two.

27:13.481 --> 27:14.814
But they're roomy.

27:34.300 --> 27:36.500
And there we are.

27:36.502 --> 27:37.601
My paranoia

27:37.603 --> 27:39.070
is put to rest.

27:39.072 --> 27:41.472
Whew.

27:41.474 --> 27:43.938
You used me.

27:48.281 --> 27:50.757
You had me come to your club.

27:50.760 --> 27:52.984
You knew word would get out,
that my father's loyalists

27:52.986 --> 27:54.352
would find me.

27:54.354 --> 27:56.487
I was the worm on your hook.

27:58.591 --> 28:01.659
With one difference, my dear.

28:01.661 --> 28:04.428
The worm is usually eaten.

28:04.430 --> 28:06.130
So you trust me now?

28:06.132 --> 28:07.798
You're alive, aren't you?

28:11.137 --> 28:12.970
I would plant roses...

28:12.972 --> 28:14.972
they cover up the smell.

28:16.509 --> 28:19.844
My father wouldn't
have killed those men.

28:21.189 --> 28:23.381
He would have invited me
to his club, as you did,

28:23.383 --> 28:24.782
but then gone further.

28:24.784 --> 28:27.018
He would have invited me to dinners.

28:27.020 --> 28:28.786
Had us seen in public.

28:28.788 --> 28:32.890
Sent the message that
the old order supports me.

28:32.892 --> 28:36.360
And those men you killed
would have pledged you loyalty.

28:37.830 --> 28:39.964
Now they're fertilizer.

28:39.966 --> 28:43.634
See, my father, he knew how to
build on the strength of others.

28:43.636 --> 28:46.975
But it's your city.

28:54.981 --> 28:57.381
New times, new methods.

29:11.364 --> 29:13.497
There was an ancient
Sumerian jewelry box here.

29:13.499 --> 29:15.099
I had just replaced it.

29:15.101 --> 29:17.535
Hiding in plain sight.

29:17.537 --> 29:20.237
Good thinking.

29:20.239 --> 29:24.842
Bruce, there's a
legend about this knife.

29:25.989 --> 29:29.457
That terrible things
happen because of it.

29:29.460 --> 29:33.584
But what if it's not just a legend?

29:33.586 --> 29:36.420
My grandfather is dead.

29:36.422 --> 29:38.522
The man that killed him,

29:38.524 --> 29:40.925
he can't have this.

29:40.927 --> 29:43.027
I won't let him.

29:43.029 --> 29:44.250
I promise.

29:46.199 --> 29:47.800
We have to get out of here.

29:47.803 --> 29:49.169
Run. Run.

30:39.285 --> 30:41.619
The Nanda Parbat consulate's
giving us the runaround,

30:41.621 --> 30:43.452
and we can't get in
there without a warrant.

30:43.455 --> 30:44.822
Bruce still hasn't called you?

30:44.824 --> 30:47.152
No. And what the bloody
hell were you doing

30:47.155 --> 30:48.789
letting him tag along with
some murder investigation

30:48.791 --> 30:50.861
- in the first place, eh?
- No, no, no.

30:50.863 --> 30:52.263
You do not get to lecture me

30:52.265 --> 30:54.147
about a lack of honesty and openness.

30:54.158 --> 30:56.418
You and Bruce have been
up to something for weeks.

30:56.421 --> 30:59.670
What have you two
gotten yourselves into?

30:59.672 --> 31:02.217
Damn it, Alfred. I'm on your side.

31:02.220 --> 31:04.500
Well, that may be, mate,
but whatever Master Bruce

31:04.503 --> 31:07.186
decides to tell you is
his decision, isn't it?

31:08.347 --> 31:09.520
You are his guardian.

31:09.523 --> 31:11.281
You are allowed to violate his privacy

31:11.284 --> 31:12.783
if it is gonna keep him out of danger.

31:12.785 --> 31:14.485
Stick to the point.

31:14.487 --> 31:17.188
What are you doing to find my boy?

31:17.190 --> 31:19.191
What can I do? Huh?

31:19.194 --> 31:21.595
I have every cop in the city on alert,

31:21.598 --> 31:24.161
but as long as Ra's al Ghul
thinks he has that knife,

31:24.163 --> 31:26.106
- his life is in danger.
- Yeah, right, and what about

31:26.108 --> 31:27.815
the other boy? Did he tell
you where he put the knife?

31:27.817 --> 31:30.816
No. But I have to assume
Bruce is taking him to get it.

31:30.819 --> 31:32.252
Right.

31:34.754 --> 31:36.954
Well, there's got to be a
clue or something inside here.

31:39.422 --> 31:41.188
What?

31:41.191 --> 31:43.480
- You stay here.
- What?

31:43.482 --> 31:45.849
The access I gave you depended on trust.

31:45.851 --> 31:48.727
If you can't be honest with
me, there's nothing I can do.

31:49.413 --> 31:51.246
Harper.

31:51.249 --> 31:53.590
If Mr. Pennyworth tries to leave,

31:53.593 --> 31:55.188
arrest him.

31:55.191 --> 31:56.523
On what charge?

31:56.526 --> 31:58.326
She'll think of something.

32:22.975 --> 32:24.975
I went to the pier.

32:26.360 --> 32:27.859
I waited.

32:27.861 --> 32:29.528
Ed didn't show.

32:29.530 --> 32:31.596
He...

32:31.598 --> 32:34.332
Oh, just get on with it.

32:34.334 --> 32:36.334
Right.

33:03.197 --> 33:04.462
Why not?

33:05.499 --> 33:07.399
W-Wait, man.

33:31.358 --> 33:32.724
Run.

33:41.168 --> 33:42.601
Bruce?

33:44.338 --> 33:45.937
Down!

33:52.079 --> 33:53.419
Let's go.

33:53.523 --> 33:54.822
Let's go.

34:00.387 --> 34:02.954
Take him. Take him, go!

34:04.625 --> 34:06.275
Aah!

34:06.278 --> 34:08.793
Get off of me!

35:06.653 --> 35:08.763
It's time you tell me what's going on.

35:08.766 --> 35:10.667
What is so important about this knife?

35:10.670 --> 35:12.524
Why are people dying for it?

35:12.526 --> 35:14.859
Excellent question, Detective.

35:14.861 --> 35:17.295
And you shall have your answer soon.

35:17.297 --> 35:21.229
Just give me the knife,
and I will release the boy.

35:21.232 --> 35:22.798
You'd like that, wouldn't you?

35:26.773 --> 35:28.440
Of course.

35:28.442 --> 35:31.509
Bruce, hand me the knife.

35:34.214 --> 35:35.714
Bruce.

35:35.716 --> 35:37.215
Hand me the knife.

35:37.217 --> 35:38.717
You don't understand.

35:39.852 --> 35:41.553
He killed Alfred.

35:41.555 --> 35:43.488
And then brought him back to life.

35:43.490 --> 35:46.791
And Alex's grandfather
was afraid of this knife.

35:46.793 --> 35:49.661
I can't give it to him.

35:49.663 --> 35:52.330
If we don't hand it
over now, Alex is dead.

35:52.332 --> 35:54.566
- That is all that matters.
- No!

35:54.568 --> 35:56.201
You don't know who he is.

35:56.203 --> 35:57.702
I can't.

35:59.039 --> 36:01.878
Well done, Bruce.

36:01.881 --> 36:05.377
You're finally beginning
to see things clearly.

36:05.379 --> 36:07.956
The question is...

36:09.883 --> 36:11.883
are you strong enough?

36:13.920 --> 36:16.221
No!

36:16.223 --> 36:18.523
Drop the weapon. Hands
in the air. On your knees.

36:20.422 --> 36:22.088
Arrest me.

36:30.762 --> 36:33.362
Ra's al Ghul is on his way to Blackgate.

36:33.364 --> 36:35.469
And we made contact with Alex's parents.

36:35.472 --> 36:37.668
It's gonna take them a
couple days to get home.

36:39.637 --> 36:42.305
Bruce...

36:43.608 --> 36:46.142
Ra's is a psychopath.

36:46.144 --> 36:48.478
You're not responsible for his actions.

36:50.181 --> 36:51.481
I want to help.

36:51.483 --> 36:53.382
But everything you've said so far...

36:53.384 --> 36:55.539
Alfred dying and coming back to life,

36:55.542 --> 36:56.886
magical waters...

36:56.888 --> 36:59.622
Give me something I can believe.

36:59.624 --> 37:01.961
Perhaps now you understand
why we held back.

37:01.964 --> 37:04.660
It doesn't matter what
you say, Detective.

37:07.398 --> 37:09.398
This is all my fault.

37:12.470 --> 37:14.470
Alex is dead because of me.

37:15.840 --> 37:17.340
I killed him.

37:26.746 --> 37:28.112
Oswald!

37:30.855 --> 37:32.855
I waited for you.

37:32.857 --> 37:34.857
Again.

37:34.859 --> 37:36.859
And you didn't show!

37:36.861 --> 37:38.861
Again.

37:38.863 --> 37:40.863
You coward.

37:43.234 --> 37:45.234
Where are you?!

37:45.236 --> 37:46.569
Here.

37:46.571 --> 37:48.649
And I may be many things,

37:48.652 --> 37:50.239
but I am not a coward.

37:52.043 --> 37:54.610
Your riddles suck.

37:54.612 --> 37:58.347
This place may make some people lie,

37:58.349 --> 38:01.617
some people speak, and some people cry.

38:01.619 --> 38:03.619
That could mean anything!

38:03.621 --> 38:05.612
Lying, speaking, crying...

38:05.615 --> 38:08.573
You're just describing a
range of human behavior!

38:08.576 --> 38:09.725
No!

38:09.727 --> 38:11.394
I meant lying,

38:11.396 --> 38:13.729
as in lying d...

38:13.731 --> 38:15.804
laying dow... lying down!

38:15.807 --> 38:17.300
As in dead!

38:17.303 --> 38:18.701
Oh.

38:18.703 --> 38:21.037
The answer was Stoker Cemetery.

38:21.039 --> 38:22.538
Clearly.

38:22.540 --> 38:24.558
Only an idiot wouldn't see that.

38:24.561 --> 38:26.108
Face it, Ed...

38:26.111 --> 38:28.508
You can't make riddles
to save your ass anymore.

38:29.781 --> 38:31.647
I guess she was right.

38:31.649 --> 38:33.086
What? Who was right?

38:33.089 --> 38:34.217
Your number one fan.

38:34.219 --> 38:36.499
She said that there was
something wrong with you.

38:37.838 --> 38:40.305
Took me a while to believe it, but...

38:42.620 --> 38:45.251
you're not smart.

38:45.254 --> 38:47.230
I am too smart.

38:47.232 --> 38:48.598
I'm the Riddler.

38:48.600 --> 38:50.900
Oh, God, that name again? Tell me,

38:50.902 --> 38:53.180
how long did it take you to
come up with those riddles?

38:53.183 --> 38:54.337
I don't know.

38:54.339 --> 38:56.106
A minute? Two minutes?

38:56.109 --> 38:58.109
A few hours.

38:58.112 --> 38:59.745
Six hours.

39:00.845 --> 39:02.345
Six hours?

39:02.347 --> 39:04.447
- Yes.
- For two bad riddles?

39:04.449 --> 39:07.316
Does that sound anything
like the old you?

39:07.318 --> 39:10.294
Well, perhaps I'm still recovering

39:10.297 --> 39:12.863
from being frozen in a block of ice!

39:12.866 --> 39:15.992
But revenge will certainly
make me feel better.

39:15.994 --> 39:17.460
You'll never have revenge on me.

39:17.462 --> 39:19.362
Uh, yeah, I will.

39:19.365 --> 39:21.664
- Uh, no, you won't.
- Oswald...

39:21.666 --> 39:23.499
I'm gonna shoot you.

39:25.503 --> 39:27.336
Yes.

39:27.338 --> 39:28.638
You might shoot me.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.706
"Kill me."

39:30.708 --> 39:34.310
But only he can get revenge on me.

39:34.312 --> 39:36.779
The man I froze on that pier.

39:38.116 --> 39:40.283
The man who would've killed himself

39:40.285 --> 39:42.718
before writing those idiotic riddles.

39:42.720 --> 39:45.788
The man whose name I
still will not speak.

39:47.392 --> 39:50.326
But he's gone.

39:50.328 --> 39:52.495
You're just Ed Nygma.

39:52.497 --> 39:54.897
And not even Ed Nygma.

39:54.899 --> 39:57.455
Because Ed Nygma would've
noticed something.

39:58.868 --> 40:00.145
What?

40:02.740 --> 40:04.740
Doesn't it feel kind of chilly in here?

40:06.144 --> 40:07.476
Oh!

40:09.210 --> 40:10.876
You remember him?

40:11.883 --> 40:14.250
My other Victor?

40:14.252 --> 40:16.319
I'm going to put you on ice.

40:16.321 --> 40:18.054
Again.

40:18.056 --> 40:20.264
You want the same
pose or something else?

40:20.267 --> 40:21.791
No. Wait, please.

40:21.794 --> 40:23.059
Got it. Same pose.

40:23.061 --> 40:25.594
No!

40:27.132 --> 40:28.631
Okay, Oswald.

40:31.736 --> 40:33.536
I'm not the Riddler.

40:38.203 --> 40:40.164
Do it.

40:40.167 --> 40:41.666
Stop.

40:44.082 --> 40:46.082
I've changed my mind.

40:47.385 --> 40:49.385
I'm not gonna freeze you.

40:49.387 --> 40:51.420
I would only be freezing

40:51.422 --> 40:54.423
Ed Nygma. Who cares about that?

40:54.425 --> 40:56.258
No.

40:56.260 --> 40:58.294
A better revenge is having you live,

40:58.296 --> 41:01.297
knowing that you are not him,

41:01.299 --> 41:03.299
and you never will be again.

41:05.536 --> 41:07.536
Good-bye, Ed.

41:15.635 --> 41:17.635
Who am I?

41:18.816 --> 41:21.817
I must've been seven or eight.

41:23.588 --> 41:25.821
It was late.

41:25.823 --> 41:28.491
I snuck downstairs to find my father

41:28.505 --> 41:31.024
with a man before him on his knees,

41:31.027 --> 41:33.662
begging for forgiveness.

41:33.664 --> 41:37.333
My father stabbed him in his neck.

41:37.335 --> 41:40.736
The next morning there
wasn't a trace of blood,

41:40.739 --> 41:43.540
and we had breakfast at that table.

41:45.782 --> 41:49.240
Now, you'd think I'd want
to stay far away from Gotham,

41:49.243 --> 41:51.472
but this house,

41:51.475 --> 41:54.984
this city, is in my veins.

41:54.986 --> 41:56.881
I'm home, Jim.

41:59.123 --> 42:01.527
The word on the street
is three Falcone capos

42:01.530 --> 42:04.460
- have gone missing.
- Hmm.

42:04.462 --> 42:06.629
They were in hiding.

42:06.631 --> 42:09.265
Penguin used me as
bait to draw them out.

42:09.268 --> 42:10.834
And kill them.

42:12.336 --> 42:14.370
And you let him?

42:15.673 --> 42:17.973
Don't act the innocent, Jim.

42:17.975 --> 42:20.327
You came to Carmine Falcone for help.

42:20.330 --> 42:22.630
It was never gonna be bloodless.

42:22.633 --> 42:25.548
So is that your plan?

42:25.550 --> 42:27.959
Get close to Penguin.

42:27.962 --> 42:30.028
Gain his confidence. What then?

42:30.031 --> 42:31.731
I need to know what you're going to do.

42:31.734 --> 42:32.988
No.

42:32.990 --> 42:35.291
You don't.

42:35.293 --> 42:37.493
You want the city back from Penguin.

42:37.495 --> 42:39.395
I'll give that to you.

42:39.398 --> 42:41.398
But you have to trust me.

43:04.322 --> 43:07.765
Get ready. Prisoner walking.

43:13.698 --> 43:15.698
Guards, stay sharp!
