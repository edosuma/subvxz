THE WORLD IS DIVIDED INTO TWO SIDES:
ONE ABUNDANT, THE OTHER SCARCE.

00:12.346 --> 00:16.391
A SELECTION PROCESS LIES BETWEEN THEM.

00:17.976 --> 00:20.938
AT THE AGE OF 20,
EACH PERSON HAS ONE CHANCE.

00:21.021 --> 00:24.983
THE CHOSEN ONES NEVER RETURN.
THEY ARE THE 3%.

01:04.940 --> 01:06.066
<i>Good morning, Michele.</i>

01:06.149 --> 01:09.403
<i>The gates to the Selection Process</i>
<i>are open.</i>

01:09.486 --> 01:14.741
<i>The estimated time of your walk is:</i>
<i>47 minutes.</i>

01:29.590 --> 01:30.716
Go, honey.

01:37.556 --> 01:41.476
I slept for maybe two hours.
I was too anxious.

01:41.560 --> 01:44.062
I doubt anyone slept last night.

01:51.862 --> 01:53.155
Take care, okay?

02:00.454 --> 02:02.372
THE CAUSE
EVERYONE IS WORTHY

02:05.792 --> 02:11.548
"Envy and resentment
have led to the rise of groups--"

02:11.632 --> 02:12.924
<i>Don't dwell on that.</i>

02:13.008 --> 02:14.468
My dear Nair,

02:14.551 --> 02:17.387
you can say that
because you are 4,000 miles away

02:17.471 --> 02:19.139
in the safety of the Offshore.

02:19.890 --> 02:22.643
These terrorists are right
at our doorstep.

02:40.285 --> 02:43.038
Are you going to pass? Look at her!

02:43.163 --> 02:45.624
You know... You know I almost made it?

02:45.707 --> 02:47.834
I lasted three days!

02:49.669 --> 02:51.213
Good luck to you!

02:52.422 --> 02:56.259
You're screwed!
You won't last a day in there!

02:59.346 --> 03:01.473
This is as far as you can come, okay?

03:02.641 --> 03:05.185
Now you go home, okay?

03:39.428 --> 03:43.849
SUBEQUATORIAL AMAZON

04:13.628 --> 04:16.173
With the faith of the Founding Couple!

04:16.298 --> 04:18.382
With the commitment
of the Founding Couple!

04:18.466 --> 04:22.345
With the strength
of the Founding Couple! Amen!

05:00.008 --> 05:01.551
What should I do with these?

05:05.347 --> 05:08.809
<i>Please do not forget your box numbers.</i>

05:08.892 --> 05:11.603
Numbers? Fuck the numbers!

05:12.020 --> 05:14.272
I'm never wearing these rags again.

05:47.597 --> 05:48.682
Three percent.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.562
Only three percent of you

05:53.645 --> 05:56.940
will form the select group of heroes
heading to the Offshore...

05:58.191 --> 06:02.362
where the Founding Couple
created the perfect world.

06:02.445 --> 06:04.656
Where there is no injustice.

06:05.574 --> 06:08.743

<i>and then, the place they deserve...</i>

SUPERIOR COUNCIL
OFFSHORE

06:10.161 --> 06:12.664
<i>...the Offshore or Inland.</i>

06:12.747 --> 06:17.752
Or as some may say,
"their side" or "our side."

06:17.836 --> 06:20.630
This Process ensures
that only the best of us

06:20.714 --> 06:22.549
will enjoy life on the Offshore.

06:23.133 --> 06:25.260
But not everyone understands this.

06:25.886 --> 06:30.849
As you know, envy and resentment
have fueled groups,

06:30.932 --> 06:34.185
<i>who in the name of a false</i>
<i>and hypocritical equality</i>

06:34.269 --> 06:39.190
<i>and with populist ideas, aim to destroy</i>
<i>everything we have achieved.</i>

06:39.774 --> 06:42.902
But they have always failed
and will continue to fail.

06:45.655 --> 06:48.825
And so, welcome, everyone.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.077
Welcome, Michele.

06:51.953 --> 06:54.706
I hope that you will do
your very best, Joana.

06:55.332 --> 06:57.626
And that you will trust the Process, Alex.

06:57.709 --> 07:01.004
Because all these years
of sacrifice, Fernando,

07:01.087 --> 07:03.173
could be rewarded right here.

07:03.965 --> 07:08.261
Remember, you each create your own merit.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.722
No matter what happens...

07:11.598 --> 07:12.933
you deserve this.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.689
Now would be a good time
to express our gratitude, don't you think?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.066
Repeat after me:

07:22.150 --> 07:23.777
We are grateful for the chance...

07:23.860 --> 07:26.196
We are grateful for the chance...

07:26.780 --> 07:30.158
-...for a better way of life.
-...for a better way of life.

07:31.743 --> 07:32.911
Thank you very much.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.913
Thank you very much.

<i>Candidates, please proceed</i>
<i>to the interview rooms. Thank you.</i>

08:48.486 --> 08:51.364
-Need some help? I can push you.
-No, I'm good, thanks.

08:51.448 --> 08:54.993
-It's all good, I can help--
-Buddy, I said I don't need it.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.203
Let them see I can get around by myself.

08:57.287 --> 09:00.707
Sorry, man.
I didn't mean to get in your way.

09:07.756 --> 09:08.923
There's a lot of people.

09:09.007 --> 09:11.217
At this rate,
by the time we get to the Offshore,

09:11.301 --> 09:13.136
we'll all be 30 or 40.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.642
Congratulations on your speech.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.316
You don't work here.

09:27.317 --> 09:28.234
My name is Aline.

09:28.985 --> 09:31.196
I was sent to evaluate
the Process this year.

09:32.947 --> 09:34.407
I don't think I got that memo.

09:35.200 --> 09:37.035
It was a last-minute decision.

09:37.118 --> 09:41.498
It's a routine analysis of the tests
and changes made over the past few years.

09:42.415 --> 09:43.625
So, I am your memo.

09:45.835 --> 09:49.881
Okay. But first I need to confirm
your identity, all right?

09:49.964 --> 09:53.551
Of course. If you didn't,
that would have to go in my report.

09:55.637 --> 09:56.554
Okay.

09:57.222 --> 09:59.516
It'll be a pleasure having you around.

10:07.148 --> 10:10.110
Why didn't you warn me
someone was coming to evaluate me?

10:10.193 --> 10:15.406
<i>You were so focused on your speech,</i>
<i>I didn't want to distract you.</i>

10:16.157 --> 10:20.537
<i>Besides, you and I have more important</i>
<i>issues to discuss, Ezequiel.</i>

10:20.620 --> 10:23.248
<i>This year's Process is very important.</i>

10:23.331 --> 10:25.959
No more important than any other year.

10:26.042 --> 10:28.962
-Nothing's changed.
-<i>Of course it has, Ezequiel.</i>

10:29.045 --> 10:30.964
-How?
<i>-Are you blind?</i>

10:31.047 --> 10:35.844
<i>For the first time in a hundred years,</i>
<i>someone was murdered here, on our side.</i>

10:35.927 --> 10:38.429
-Tell me what that has--
<i>-Don't start again.</i>

10:38.513 --> 10:42.725
Nair, please tell me what this has to do
with me and with my Process.

10:42.809 --> 10:44.519
<i>You're the Process Leader,</i>

10:44.602 --> 10:47.397
<i>responsible for everyone</i>
<i>who comes to the Offshore.</i>

10:47.480 --> 10:50.775
He proved to be perfectly suitable
while he was here--

10:50.859 --> 10:53.987
<i>I'm not the one you need to convince.</i>
<i>I'm just warning you,</i>

10:54.070 --> 10:57.949
<i>there are those who want to blame you</i>
<i>for the first homicide in our history.</i>

10:58.491 --> 11:01.828
<i>It's given Councilor Matheus</i>
<i>and his followers leverage.</i>

11:01.911 --> 11:02.871
Matheus, of course.

11:02.954 --> 11:04.998
<i>He wants his people</i>
<i>to take over the Process.</i>

11:05.081 --> 11:07.625
<i>He wants a lighter Process,</i>
<i>a weaker Process.</i>

11:07.750 --> 11:08.877
<i>To do things his way.</i>

11:08.960 --> 11:10.587
This is my Process.

11:10.712 --> 11:12.297
Only I can lead it.

11:14.591 --> 11:19.220
Look, I have enough to worry about
at the moment, Nair. I'm sorry.

12:54.857 --> 12:58.194
-Hi, how are you? My name is--
-Alex.

12:59.779 --> 13:03.241
Before we begin, are you aware
we have no inclusion policies for--

13:03.324 --> 13:04.200
Yes, I am.

13:04.283 --> 13:06.411
You believe you can make it
through the Process?

13:06.494 --> 13:07.620
Absolutely.

13:07.704 --> 13:09.789
I'm going to ask a sensitive question.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.583
When was the last time
you washed your hair?

13:15.086 --> 13:17.630
Since the last time
I had enough water to waste.

13:19.549 --> 13:21.217
Can we go out sometime?

13:21.968 --> 13:24.470
I'd like to get to know you better
outside of these walls.

13:26.014 --> 13:29.142
If all A's are B's,
but not all B's are C's,

13:29.225 --> 13:32.395
is it possible to have an A
that's also a C?

13:32.478 --> 13:33.563
Five seconds, okay?

13:37.108 --> 13:41.571
I feel like I am one of...
I'm sure that I'm one of the best...

13:42.280 --> 13:44.407
Listen, Carolina... take a breath.

13:44.949 --> 13:47.535
I'll give you another chance
to pull yourself together.

13:48.077 --> 13:52.540
I am... I'm sure I'm part
of the three percent of...

13:52.623 --> 13:54.000
of people...

13:54.876 --> 13:56.169
Elimination reason number two.

13:57.378 --> 14:00.673
What? Eliminated now? I didn't know
I could be eliminated now--

14:00.757 --> 14:02.467
Carolina, look at yourself.

14:02.550 --> 14:06.220
If you don't believe you're worthy
of passing, how can I?

14:14.228 --> 14:15.980
And what is your biggest weakness?

14:17.899 --> 14:19.275
I care too much about people?

14:25.782 --> 14:27.784
Just kidding.
But that's a good answer, right?

14:28.910 --> 14:33.122
It's a place where each of us can grow

14:33.206 --> 14:35.958
and reach our full potential.

14:36.042 --> 14:39.754
-But it's also about helping others and--
-Enough. You answered the question.

14:39.837 --> 14:41.255
May I just add another point?

14:41.339 --> 14:43.883
I wanted to say it's about
thinking of the community and--

14:44.842 --> 14:46.094
Have you seen this before?

14:48.262 --> 14:50.306
It's graffitied everywhere.

14:50.390 --> 14:52.809
And how do you feel about
the ideas of the Cause?

14:53.643 --> 14:55.937
They're just a bunch of losers
who couldn't pass

14:56.020 --> 14:58.022
and now they want to ruin everything.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.941
Do you know anyone
who made it through?

15:00.691 --> 15:03.903
-Luis, my boyfriend.
-Let go of me!

15:03.986 --> 15:05.947
He wasn't understanding me!
I need to go back!

15:06.030 --> 15:08.241
-Last year?
-Yes.

15:08.324 --> 15:10.243
So you want to pass to be cured?

15:10.326 --> 15:13.079
I have other ambitions and goals
as well as that one.

15:13.162 --> 15:14.997
So, you want to pass to see him again.

15:15.081 --> 15:16.416
-A romantic reunion?
-No.

15:16.499 --> 15:17.542
-No?
-No.

15:17.625 --> 15:21.003
He give you that necklace? If you're
not a romantic, why do you wear it?

15:21.087 --> 15:23.840
-It's a souvenir.
-A souvenir!

15:24.382 --> 15:26.884
Did your father raise you
to have faith in the Process?

15:27.009 --> 15:28.719
Yes. He's a pastor.

15:28.803 --> 15:31.472
You are one of the worst candidates
I've ever interviewed.

15:35.143 --> 15:37.895
Maybe you're just the worst interviewer
there is.

15:38.855 --> 15:40.022
Who do you think you are?

15:40.106 --> 15:43.192
Don't you realize we have candidates
begging to not be eliminated?

15:43.276 --> 15:46.279
I doubt the Offshore
is interested in beggars.

15:59.250 --> 16:02.170
-But why?
-Enough. You're eliminated.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.130
You're losing one of the best candidates.

16:04.213 --> 16:07.258
You talked for 20 minutes
without saying anything original.

16:07.341 --> 16:08.926
-Please--
-Memorized bullshit.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.846
Please, one more chance.
I've dreamed of this my entire life.

16:11.929 --> 16:16.058
I swear I'll shut up. Is that it?
Is it because I talk too much?

16:16.142 --> 16:17.810
I won't say another word, I swear!

16:17.894 --> 16:20.771
I've been waiting for this my whole life.
Don't eliminate me!

16:20.855 --> 16:23.691
Instructions on how to overcome
the trauma of elimination

16:23.774 --> 16:26.319
will be given to you
while you return your uniform.

16:27.612 --> 16:30.281
-Please!
-Please, leave.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.742
-Please!
-Another candidate needs this seat.

16:32.825 --> 16:37.914
No! This is my seat! My seat! Let me go!
I'm not leaving! This is my dream!

16:38.039 --> 16:39.624
I have to get to the Offshore!

16:40.208 --> 16:43.920
Let me go! Please!
I swear, I swear, I'm good!

16:44.045 --> 16:48.758
You are losing the best candidate!
I am the best! I am!

16:50.635 --> 16:52.803
How do you picture the Offshore?

16:52.887 --> 16:55.723
I imagine... I'll be happy.

16:56.140 --> 16:57.475
I'll be with my family.

16:57.558 --> 17:00.394
Relaxed. Safe. Fulfilled.

17:00.478 --> 17:02.021
Now, how do I picture it?

17:02.104 --> 17:05.900
If it's full of trees,
cars that can fly, I really don't know.

17:06.358 --> 17:08.486
But I know I'm going to be surprised.

17:08.569 --> 17:13.406
And don't you feel bad, Fernando?
For being a burden on your father?

17:13.491 --> 17:17.869
I'm not a burden. It's the opposite.
He believes in me, in my abilities.

17:17.954 --> 17:19.247
How touching.

17:19.329 --> 17:22.290
Tell me something.
How do you know he actually made it?

17:23.542 --> 17:24.417
He made it.

17:24.502 --> 17:28.172
Sometimes, candidates don't return
due to unforeseen circumstances.

17:28.256 --> 17:29.632
Unfortunate accidents.

17:30.466 --> 17:31.842
You look very calm.

17:31.926 --> 17:35.263
There's nothing to be afraid of.
My family has done well in the Process.

17:35.346 --> 17:38.724
I have uncles, cousins... my parents.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.770
Do you really believe
that gives you an advantage?

17:43.688 --> 17:46.899
I am here to judge you,
not your family history.

17:49.360 --> 17:50.194
I know.

17:51.237 --> 17:52.738
That's not what I meant.

17:53.781 --> 17:55.866
-Do you think your father loves you?
-Yes.

17:55.950 --> 17:57.577
-Do you love him?
-Of course I do.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.328
So, tell me three things about him.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.288
He...

18:01.789 --> 18:02.873
He...

18:03.749 --> 18:05.710
I don't know off the top of my head.

18:05.793 --> 18:09.714
Tell me something you admire him for,
something you've learned from him.

18:09.797 --> 18:10.756
He...

18:12.592 --> 18:13.551
He...

18:17.555 --> 18:18.973
You told me that you love him.

18:20.057 --> 18:22.935
You want to pass because your father's
been telling you to pass

18:23.019 --> 18:25.813
-since you were a kid.
-No, I want to pass to end my pain

18:25.896 --> 18:27.898
so he doesn't waste all his time on me.

18:27.982 --> 18:31.736
Look, if you keep saying the same thing,
I'll eliminate you right now.

18:31.819 --> 18:34.322
Why do you really want to pass?

18:34.405 --> 18:36.657
So I won't have a life like his.

18:41.245 --> 18:43.914
APPROVED

18:47.001 --> 18:49.587
-What's his name again?
-Luis. Luis Ferreira.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.839
Let's find out
if he really made it through.

18:54.258 --> 18:55.468
Do you really want to know?

18:57.261 --> 19:01.015
No. No, I don't care.
That's not why I want to pass.

19:01.140 --> 19:03.684
So, I guess that necklace
doesn't mean anything, huh?

19:06.729 --> 19:10.691
If you take too long, I'll question
your honesty and eliminate you.

19:28.042 --> 19:29.126
Are you gonna cry?

19:36.133 --> 19:37.927
You can move on to the next round.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.805
APPROVED

19:40.888 --> 19:42.014
You did the right thing.

19:43.974 --> 19:44.850
He's dead.

20:08.165 --> 20:11.168
Cássia, what about the son of a bitch
that was caught?

20:11.293 --> 20:14.505
It's confirmed. He's with the Cause.
Going by the name Jorge.

20:14.588 --> 20:17.341
Caught him alive, no collateral damage.

20:18.175 --> 20:19.635
-Is that him?
-Yes.

20:20.761 --> 20:23.764
-Has the interrogation started?
-Yes.

20:23.848 --> 20:27.560
He told us one of this year's candidates
is a mole for the Cause.

20:28.310 --> 20:33.816
He hasn't given us a name yet,
but it's just a matter of time.

20:33.899 --> 20:37.069
If there is a mole among them,
I need to know as soon as possible.

21:26.827 --> 21:27.912
They captured Jorge alive.

21:30.122 --> 21:33.083
Those pigs are one step ahead of us.

21:34.210 --> 21:37.338
The question is,
with Jorge now in their hands,

21:37.421 --> 21:40.132
what can he reveal about the moles?

21:40.257 --> 21:41.842
-Does he know names?
-No.

21:41.926 --> 21:45.846
He knew I had sent someone.
He didn't have a name.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.223
Maybe a few details.

21:47.348 --> 21:49.475
-Why did he know any details at all?
-Calm down.

21:49.558 --> 21:52.019
This puts the whole operation at risk.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.355
Calm down.
We have to find out what he knew.

21:54.438 --> 21:56.190
I know how to run my team.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.943
And I know Jorge.
He's devoted to the Cause.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.569
He would never betray us!

22:00.653 --> 22:05.866
Take it easy. It's not about betrayal.
No one can withstand their torture.

22:05.950 --> 22:10.746
We have to assume that whatever he knows,
the Process now knows.

22:17.711 --> 22:19.922
<i>Hey, Cássia. Any news?</i>

22:20.005 --> 22:21.340
He's still resisting.

22:21.423 --> 22:25.553
He hasn't revealed the name of the mole,
but it's just a matter of time.

22:27.263 --> 22:28.722
He's softening up.

22:37.147 --> 22:39.900
This is bullshit! It's all bullshit!

22:41.193 --> 22:43.862
Motherfuckers, there are
much worse candidates than me!

22:50.452 --> 22:51.495
I feel bad for them.

22:52.329 --> 22:54.331
Eliminated candidates, that way.

22:54.456 --> 22:58.544
-Eliminated? That way.
-Hold on...

23:02.047 --> 23:05.092
Yeah, but... there's nothing we can do.

23:06.135 --> 23:09.013
It might be fair, but it's still sad.

23:19.315 --> 23:20.524
Stand back!

23:21.483 --> 23:22.568
Get back!

23:30.951 --> 23:33.287
Dr. Gisele will take care
of the candidate.

23:33.370 --> 23:35.873
Right now
we need everyone to remain calm.

23:35.956 --> 23:39.501
If you need anything,
need to talk, counseling,

23:39.585 --> 23:41.503
we are here to help you.

23:41.587 --> 23:44.882
Don't let this interfere
with the most important day of your lives.

23:44.965 --> 23:46.717
Keep going with your tests.

23:46.800 --> 23:49.386
The Process continues this way. Follow me.

23:49.511 --> 23:50.387
Okay.

24:03.817 --> 24:06.362
Let's go.
It's hard, but we have to move on.

24:13.077 --> 24:17.873
<i>Candidates, please report</i>
<i>to the registry scanner.</i>

24:30.219 --> 24:33.055
Naughty boy. Aren't you ashamed?

24:34.807 --> 24:37.434
-What?
-Your fake registration.

24:38.143 --> 24:41.647
When they do it,
they only use three stitches.

24:43.857 --> 24:46.026
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:48.821 --> 24:50.364
Let's see what the scanner says.

24:59.623 --> 25:01.667
WELCOME

26:18.494 --> 26:20.245
This next test is very simple.

26:20.329 --> 26:23.832
It evaluates your spatial logic,
geometric reasoning

26:23.916 --> 26:25.501
and basic motor skills.

26:25.626 --> 26:29.797
Using these pieces,
each of you will have three minutes

26:29.880 --> 26:32.132
to assemble as many cubes as possible.

26:32.633 --> 26:34.301
We expect a minimum of nine cubes.

26:34.384 --> 26:37.054
Any less and you will be eliminated.

26:39.098 --> 26:43.769
And when the table turns red,
it means your time is up.

26:43.852 --> 26:46.063
One, two, three, begin.

26:58.534 --> 26:59.660
Thanks.

27:00.410 --> 27:03.163
What's her deal?
Trying to be politically correct?

27:03.247 --> 27:05.666
Doesn't she know
it's every man for himself?

27:18.095 --> 27:23.183
Damn it! I've asked them to fix this crap
a thousand times.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.228
There we go.

28:06.977 --> 28:09.354
That's my cube! What the fuck?

28:09.438 --> 28:11.815
Time's up!
Whoever has nine cubes passes.

28:13.483 --> 28:14.776
Didn't you see him steal my cube?

28:14.860 --> 28:17.654
Time's up. Eight cubes.
Sorry, you're eliminated.

28:17.779 --> 28:20.198
-Thanks for participating.
-Motherfucker!

28:20.741 --> 28:23.327
-Let me go! Let me go!
-Take him.

28:23.869 --> 28:26.079
No! Let me go!

28:27.122 --> 28:28.957
Ezequiel, that kid stole the cube.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.546
Nine, you passed.

28:36.840 --> 28:38.425
Sorry, you've been eliminated.

28:42.679 --> 28:44.264
Only eight cubes. Eliminated.

28:48.018 --> 28:48.936
Eliminated.

28:57.319 --> 29:00.322
Nine cubes? You passed.

29:03.283 --> 29:05.827
Eight plus a cube made of cubes. Nine.

29:07.496 --> 29:08.580
You passed as well.

29:12.501 --> 29:13.585
Eliminated.

29:16.380 --> 29:17.297
Nine.

29:19.508 --> 29:20.509
Eleven?

29:29.977 --> 29:31.061
Excuse me.

29:32.020 --> 29:34.815
You have to understand,
while each test has an obvious goal,

29:34.898 --> 29:37.651
what's really important
is what's behind them.

29:37.734 --> 29:39.695
But you may not get that yet.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.614
I'm not here to judge, Ezequiel.
I'm just recording the facts.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.408
She will never understand, Ezequiel.

30:21.695 --> 30:24.114
-Delicious.
-It's too sweet.

30:26.742 --> 30:31.038
So, you... I heard...
I heard some of the girls talking.

30:31.121 --> 30:32.914
They said you're an Álvares.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.544
-Your family always passes.
-Yeah.

30:38.045 --> 30:40.005
So? What's the secret?

30:41.548 --> 30:43.216
Congeniality, of course.

30:47.095 --> 30:50.140
I want to thank you, really.
What you did--

30:50.265 --> 30:53.101
Forget it. It was nothing.

31:01.318 --> 31:02.361
Look who's here.

31:03.153 --> 31:04.321
That's him.

31:06.573 --> 31:07.783
Is that him?

31:08.784 --> 31:09.951
That's so messed up.

31:10.035 --> 31:12.329
I don't understand
how the Process let him pass.

31:12.412 --> 31:14.790
I don't get the criteria.

31:14.915 --> 31:16.833
Look at him... Cheater.

31:20.796 --> 31:24.966
Go on. Keep talking about me.
Go ahead. I don't care.

31:25.967 --> 31:29.596
I'm impressed how everyone here
is so honest, so fair.

31:30.097 --> 31:32.808
I just don't understand why
none of you did anything.

31:33.350 --> 31:35.977
Why didn't anyone try to stop me
or help the other guy?

31:36.061 --> 31:39.147
The ones in the room.
Why didn't you do anything?

31:39.606 --> 31:43.193
Do you know why? Do you? Anyone?

31:43.860 --> 31:47.989
I know. Because everyone is here
to make it through. Everyone.

31:48.073 --> 31:50.575
And everyone will do
whatever it takes to pass.

31:51.827 --> 31:57.541
I only did what everyone here
will do sooner or later. That's all.

31:57.999 --> 31:59.835
And most importantly:

32:00.377 --> 32:03.880
If you keep thinking
you're better than me...

32:05.173 --> 32:07.717
then you'll lose. And you'll lose to me.

32:07.801 --> 32:11.430
And you'll lose to everyone here
who really gets what's at stake.

32:11.513 --> 32:12.472
For real.

32:14.891 --> 32:17.602
What about you, big guy?
What do you say?

32:19.146 --> 32:21.940
-Why don't you shut up?
-No, I want your opinion.

32:22.649 --> 32:25.485
Are you saying you'd just
keep your head down

32:25.569 --> 32:27.988
and accept elimination
without a word?

32:28.071 --> 32:29.114
Would you do that?

32:29.698 --> 32:31.158
Would you be that stupid?

32:31.241 --> 32:32.659
Take your hands off me, cheater.

32:39.916 --> 32:41.626
Take that, you son of a bitch!

32:42.711 --> 32:44.379
Say something now, motherfucker!

32:44.463 --> 32:45.714
Come on, loser!

32:46.590 --> 32:47.424
Come on!

32:50.385 --> 32:52.345
Come on! Come on!

32:53.513 --> 32:56.057
That's enough! Stop! Leave the guy alone!

32:56.141 --> 32:57.017
Let him go.

32:58.852 --> 32:59.769
Let's go.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.218
You don't fool me.

33:31.301 --> 33:33.220
I know you got beat up on purpose.

33:37.933 --> 33:41.645
It worked. Now you have
a bunch of idiots on your side.

33:51.446 --> 33:54.866
Actually, having a friend in the Process
isn't such a bad idea.

33:56.952 --> 33:59.955
Me? Why me?

34:00.914 --> 34:02.832
Because if you betray me...

34:03.416 --> 34:05.460
I'll tell them your registration is fake.

34:16.679 --> 34:18.514
I know you're very busy,

34:18.598 --> 34:21.851
but if I wait until you have free time,
we'll never get a chance to talk.

34:21.935 --> 34:25.938
I'm waiting for someone,
but in the meantime, go ahead.

34:27.232 --> 34:31.110
Tell me, how would you evaluate
your performance over the last five years?

34:31.194 --> 34:34.614
My productivity rates
have reached record levels.

34:34.697 --> 34:37.993
What about adaptation?
Community well-being?

34:38.118 --> 34:40.286
Your candidates haven't done well
in that area.

34:40.370 --> 34:43.915
They didn't score well when compared
to productivity rates.

34:43.998 --> 34:46.167
Which, once again,
have reached record levels.

34:46.251 --> 34:50.005
Are you familiar with the concept
in which selected candidates

34:50.130 --> 34:52.882
adopt the personality
of the Process Leader?

34:53.757 --> 34:56.969
Sounds like the typical psychobabble
of Councilor Matheus.

34:57.512 --> 34:58.680
Have you met?

35:04.811 --> 35:06.354
How have you been feeling?

35:06.438 --> 35:08.857
I'm great. What a question.
Why do you ask?

35:09.691 --> 35:12.360
I'm just wondering
if you ever think about your wife.

35:12.819 --> 35:14.404
-What?
-Julia.

35:15.196 --> 35:17.532
I never met her,
but I heard what happened.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.994
And even from afar,
it sounded painful. Even--

35:22.329 --> 35:24.497
-I'm sorry. I'll come back later.
-Come in.

35:24.581 --> 35:25.915
Aline was on her way out.

35:25.999 --> 35:29.461
Actually, I would love to sit in
on your meeting, if you don't mind.

35:30.170 --> 35:31.254
Please.

35:33.006 --> 35:34.299
I was waiting for you.

35:37.510 --> 35:40.680
I called you here to talk about
the candidate who committed suicide.

35:50.815 --> 35:53.943
I did his interview, his evaluation,

35:54.027 --> 35:56.613
and he definitely showed no--

35:56.696 --> 35:58.615
Denise, I'm not questioning your judgment.

35:58.698 --> 36:01.660
On the contrary, I'm worried about you.

36:03.828 --> 36:04.663
I'm fine.

36:07.040 --> 36:12.754
Agent Denise, sadly, suicide
is not uncommon among candidates.

36:13.755 --> 36:15.548
They do it out of shame.

36:16.716 --> 36:18.093
Because they are weak.

36:19.469 --> 36:21.971
-It's pathetic.
-Pathetic.

36:22.347 --> 36:27.227
But it takes a toll.
And there's no shame in admitting that.

36:29.729 --> 36:31.981
We can't ignore our feelings...

36:32.941 --> 36:34.609
or we'll never find happiness.

36:41.783 --> 36:46.579
Of course, the suicide of a young man
with no merits is a tragedy.

36:47.122 --> 36:48.081
But you...

36:49.624 --> 36:51.459
you're a person of merit.

36:53.294 --> 36:54.671
That's why it's always good...

37:02.095 --> 37:04.597
Stop, Ezequiel!

37:31.708 --> 37:34.669
I do that every day to remind myself
that what we do

37:34.753 --> 37:36.755
is a matter of life and death.

37:38.798 --> 37:41.301
I understand. Perfectly.

37:42.844 --> 37:44.637
Do you see things more clearly?

38:14.876 --> 38:16.586
Ezequiel, I would like to thank you.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.048
Everything I've learned here
in such a short time

38:20.131 --> 38:22.675
is beyond anything
I would've learned somewhere else.

38:23.593 --> 38:24.511
Thank you.

38:38.066 --> 38:39.901
Ezequiel, we have a lead.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.986
<i>I want the mole's name.</i>

38:42.070 --> 38:43.613
It's one of two candidates.

38:49.828 --> 38:52.747
Michele? Bruna? Come with me, please.

39:11.224 --> 39:12.475
Thank you, Bernardo.

39:13.309 --> 39:14.143
This way.

39:25.196 --> 39:27.282
-What's that?
-Close your eyes.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.002
Here. Duck your head.

39:59.772 --> 40:02.400
-I don't know what's happening.
-Me neither.

40:02.483 --> 40:04.152
Look, I know what this is about.

40:04.235 --> 40:08.781
You heard me complaining about the guy
who cheated in the test.

40:08.907 --> 40:12.368
I won't criticize the Process anymore.
I've learned my lesson.

40:36.768 --> 40:38.645
Have you two met before?

40:39.479 --> 40:40.939
-Yes, we--
-We--

40:42.190 --> 40:44.984
-We live on the same block.
-Where do you live?

40:45.568 --> 40:48.696
I live on 7th Street,
block 35, apartment 42.

40:49.948 --> 40:52.116
Same block, apartment 12.

40:53.201 --> 40:57.038
We received some information
that a mole working for the Cause

40:57.121 --> 40:59.248
lives on that same street,
on the same block.

40:59.749 --> 41:01.292
How do you know that?

41:02.919 --> 41:08.549
The fact is, we know that
one of you sitting here is the mole.

41:08.633 --> 41:10.009
I just don't know which one.

41:10.093 --> 41:12.053
So, I have three minutes to find out

41:12.136 --> 41:15.014
who is with the Cause
and who is innocent.

41:15.098 --> 41:18.309
And if I can't figure it out,
the recommended step

41:18.393 --> 41:20.728
is that I kill both of you.

41:20.853 --> 41:22.313
-Ma'am--
-There must be a mistake.

41:22.397 --> 41:24.107
I don't know anyone in the Cause.

41:24.190 --> 41:25.733
-Me neither.
-We know each other.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.610
I swear to you--

41:27.694 --> 41:29.946
Sit down! Stay back, please.

41:32.699 --> 41:35.076
-This is a test.
-No, unfortunately, it's not.

41:43.835 --> 41:47.422
I'm innocent!
I'm-- I am not with the Cause!

41:47.547 --> 41:49.716
-I don't know anyone in the Cause!
-Me neither.

41:49.799 --> 41:52.427
-I am not with the Cause.
-Neither am I.

41:52.552 --> 41:54.178
-Are you accusing me?
-Of course not!

41:54.262 --> 41:56.973
But she said it's one of us
and I'm saying it's not me.

41:57.056 --> 41:59.017
-It's not me, either!
-Bruna, you know me.

41:59.100 --> 42:02.729
-You know I'm not with the Cause!
-I can't sit here listening to excuses.

42:02.812 --> 42:05.148
I need a confession, do you understand?

42:06.774 --> 42:09.819
-Bruna, please...
-It's not me.

42:12.405 --> 42:17.702
Whoever is with the Cause
and believes that they're a savior...

42:18.494 --> 42:22.540
this is your chance to do something useful
for society and save someone's life.

42:23.583 --> 42:27.503
Because you will die anyway
and take an innocent person with you.

42:47.440 --> 42:49.734
Bruna, please...

42:49.817 --> 42:51.986
if you are with the Cause, save my life.

42:52.070 --> 42:53.780
I'm not with the Cause, Michele.

42:53.863 --> 42:55.823
-I'm not.
-Then they have the wrong information.

42:55.907 --> 42:56.866
Of course they do!

42:57.784 --> 42:59.702
What are we going to do,
for God's sake?

43:00.328 --> 43:02.538
-This isn't happening--
-We're gonna die.

43:02.914 --> 43:04.373
We're already dead.

43:05.249 --> 43:06.250
What are we gonna do?

43:08.169 --> 43:09.128
Listen...

43:09.879 --> 43:11.089
we have one way out.

43:11.172 --> 43:12.632
We have to attack this woman.

43:12.715 --> 43:16.302
-We have to attack her.
-We can't attack her. She's armed.

43:16.385 --> 43:18.429
If we get her gun, she'll--

43:18.513 --> 43:19.347
She won't.

43:20.223 --> 43:21.390
It's you and me.

43:22.225 --> 43:24.352
Two against one.

43:26.479 --> 43:30.817
Bruna, when she comes back,
we'll take her gun.

43:31.442 --> 43:33.236
We're gonna run away
from the Process.

43:33.319 --> 43:34.445
We're gonna run away.

43:34.529 --> 43:38.825
Bruna, we can't die now.
I don't wanna die.

43:40.326 --> 43:41.369
Look at me.

43:43.079 --> 43:44.372
Trust me, okay?

43:46.666 --> 43:49.836
I'll give you a signal
and we'll attack her.

43:58.136 --> 43:59.512
Your time is up.

44:02.390 --> 44:03.724
Who's going to confess?

44:09.355 --> 44:11.232
<i>Why do you want to make it through?</i>

44:12.150 --> 44:14.318
I have a lot to offer the Offshore.

44:14.402 --> 44:16.571
If I have enough merit,
you will see it in me.

44:26.164 --> 44:28.207
Your boyfriend gave you this.

44:28.291 --> 44:30.209
What boyfriend? I don't have a boyfriend.

44:31.169 --> 44:32.170
I know.

44:32.753 --> 44:34.172
It's for the interviewer.

44:34.755 --> 44:37.633
You have to say exactly
what the Process wants to hear.

44:55.818 --> 44:57.111
It was Ezequiel.

44:57.987 --> 45:00.823
-Ezequiel killed my brother.
-Don't think about that.

45:02.158 --> 45:04.452
You won't get anywhere near Ezequiel.

45:05.286 --> 45:08.164
And if you do, run. Stay away from him.

45:19.926 --> 45:23.221
I'm sorry you had to see that.
Move aside.

45:31.103 --> 45:31.979
Get up.

45:33.773 --> 45:34.899
Get over there.

45:36.275 --> 45:38.277
I think I can trust you.

45:39.946 --> 45:41.155
I got this.

45:44.075 --> 45:46.035
That's what my brother used to say.

45:47.036 --> 45:49.956
Whenever I asked him for anything,
he'd say, "I got this."

45:55.086 --> 45:56.462
You really loved him.

45:58.256 --> 46:01.008
He was five years older than me and...

46:02.468 --> 46:04.095
when our parents died...

46:06.222 --> 46:09.684
Revenge isn't about killing Ezequiel.

46:11.185 --> 46:13.521
It's destroying their entire world.

46:15.356 --> 46:19.443
You have to act as if you blindly believe
in the Process.

46:19.944 --> 46:23.572
Act completely naive.
Tell me... can you cry?

46:24.865 --> 46:25.866
Yes.

46:26.909 --> 46:27.827
That will be useful.

46:30.538 --> 46:31.998
Are you gonna cry?

46:32.957 --> 46:36.544
<i>The key is to hold back your tears.</i>
<i>Fight them back.</i>

46:37.044 --> 46:38.379
That's what gets to them.

46:40.214 --> 46:41.173
I got this.

46:42.925 --> 46:46.178
Michele, what just happened
has to stay between us.

46:47.179 --> 46:51.100
A mole for the Cause is not the concern
of the other candidates.

48:22.233 --> 48:23.692
Where were you?

48:26.737 --> 48:28.364
Michele, what happened?

49:38.225 --> 49:40.227
