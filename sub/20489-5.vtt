00:21.754 --> 00:23.221
Everything
went fine, adam.

00:23.256 --> 00:25.762
There was
no gsa interference and no
problems at the safehouse.

00:25.797 --> 00:28.267
Yeah,
unless you count this girl
trying to convince jesse to

00:28.768 --> 00:30.772
come with her into
the underground as a problem.

00:31.273 --> 00:33.242
I see.

00:33.277 --> 00:34.745
I was only flirting.

00:34.780 --> 00:36.750
I have no
time for romance.

00:36.785 --> 00:38.789
Far too busy
making the world a
safer place to live.

00:38.824 --> 00:40.257
Oh, please.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.295
Besides...
she wasn't my type.

01:01.334 --> 01:05.342
Freaks of the world, my name
is kilohertz and i'm here to

01:05.376 --> 01:08.349
speak to you,
for you and about you.

01:08.849 --> 01:11.320
I've had it up to here
with the way we're treated.

01:11.355 --> 01:14.360
So consider this fair warning,
we have the power and we're

01:14.395 --> 01:17.365
not going to take it anymore.

01:32.898 --> 01:34.902
Adam,
whatever that was,
we just lost power.

01:34.937 --> 01:36.424
And the computers are down.

01:36.459 --> 01:37.909
Yeah, i'm offline here, too.

01:37.944 --> 01:38.875
Hold on.

01:38.910 --> 01:41.381
I'll try to reboot.

01:41.416 --> 01:42.919
It's going to take me a
few minutes to link back up.

01:43.419 --> 01:45.423
Yeah, well, in
a few minutes, we're going to
be a smear on the landscape.

01:49.431 --> 01:51.436
We were pulling
into the garage when
that power surge hit.

01:51.938 --> 01:53.906
What's going on, adam?

01:53.941 --> 01:55.909
Jesse and shalimar
are up in the double helix.

01:55.944 --> 01:58.449
They've lost power and
i can't reboot them from here.

02:04.461 --> 02:04.964
It won't reboot.

02:05.464 --> 02:06.466
Don't have enough juice.

02:09.471 --> 02:10.941
Damn.

02:10.976 --> 02:12.479
Okay, stand back.

02:12.514 --> 02:13.982
Stand back.

02:29.512 --> 02:31.016
Okay, try it now.

02:33.522 --> 02:35.489
Shalimar, jesse, you there?

02:35.525 --> 02:37.529
Just got the manual
override unlocked.

02:37.564 --> 02:39.033
We're still diving.

02:39.533 --> 02:42.039
Okay, i got it, got it.

02:45.545 --> 02:48.050
We're leveling off.

02:56.068 --> 02:58.572
Maybe we won't cut
it so close next time, huh?

02:58.607 --> 03:01.077
Too much of an adrenaline
rush, even for me.

03:02.579 --> 03:04.585
Yeah, roger that.

03:08.593 --> 03:12.100
Well, you just
saved their lives.

03:15.608 --> 03:17.076
What was that all about?

03:17.111 --> 03:19.113
That was
about a new mutant that
we've got to find before

03:19.149 --> 03:23.122
the gsa does,
for his sake and ours.

04:36.003 --> 04:39.008
Is it just me or is this
kilohertz guy too much or what?

04:39.043 --> 04:41.981
A dozen counts of electronic
vandalism in a week and

04:42.016 --> 04:45.022
counting,
a million e-mails rerouted
to never be seen again...

04:45.057 --> 04:47.490
the guy's a riot.

04:47.525 --> 04:49.530
I know we believe
everything we're told...

04:49.565 --> 04:50.998
mute.

04:51.033 --> 04:52.536
You seen
the message ports?

04:54.039 --> 04:55.543
Looks like everybody in the
world's bending over backwards

04:55.578 --> 04:57.011
trying to figure
out how he does it.

04:57.046 --> 04:58.548
Yeah, well, every new
mutant knows the truth.

04:58.583 --> 05:00.318
It's a threat to
everything we're doing.

05:00.353 --> 05:02.208
Well, you don't
have to convince me.

05:02.243 --> 05:04.025
He almost got
me and jesse killed.

05:04.060 --> 05:05.563
And he's causing trouble
for people who have nothing

05:05.598 --> 05:07.031
to do with new mutants too.

05:07.066 --> 05:10.573
A high school freshman
was beaten into a coma by three

05:10.608 --> 05:13.544
students who
decided he was a freak.

05:13.579 --> 05:16.585
Hospitals have lost
power during his last rampage.

05:16.620 --> 05:19.357
Yeah, well, lucky the
emergency generators kicked in.

05:19.392 --> 05:22.096
You know, and the traffic
accidents he's caused by eating

05:22.131 --> 05:24.118
the power grid, that's
not won him many friends.

05:24.153 --> 05:26.105
Part of me thinks that
his rants are a cry for help.

05:26.606 --> 05:29.076
That's not helping
the people that he's hurt.

05:29.111 --> 05:31.114
Yeah, and sooner or later,
people are going to realize

05:31.149 --> 05:33.084
what he really means by "freak".

05:33.119 --> 05:35.123
It's new mutants who'll
take the heat for that.

05:49.652 --> 05:51.656
I assume you've heard
about this kilohertz,

05:52.157 --> 05:54.627
mr. Renfield, and his
invasion of this facility?

05:54.662 --> 05:56.666
It's all anyone at the academy's
talking about, mr. Eckhart.

05:57.168 --> 06:00.174
Allowing him to
continue to operate could
be a disaster for the gsa.

06:00.210 --> 06:02.643
The minute the general
public gets an idea of these

06:02.678 --> 06:07.153
anomalies out
there, our work gets
harder - and uglier.

06:07.188 --> 06:11.196
I mean, the last thing
we want is public knowledge
of these monstrosities.

06:11.697 --> 06:14.952
It's bad enough
these super-powered
freaks are out there

06:14.988 --> 06:18.853
just waiting to ambush the
status quo, but to have this

06:18.888 --> 06:22.720
anarchist electronically
invade this facility and wreak

06:23.220 --> 06:25.725
electronic havoc at wili...

06:30.235 --> 06:32.488
well we
have to stop him.

06:32.524 --> 06:34.709
I understand
completely, sir.

06:34.743 --> 06:38.717
I see you're
in your final semester.

06:38.752 --> 06:44.263
I seem to recall
that your indoctrination
had its problematic sides.

06:44.298 --> 06:47.769
Got off to a rough start,
sir, but once i realized

06:48.271 --> 06:50.775
everything the genetic
security agency has to offer...

06:50.810 --> 06:53.281
and everything you and your
powers have to offer the gsa.

06:53.783 --> 06:57.290
It's rare that so raw a recruit
is pressed into early service.

06:57.789 --> 06:59.760
Early service?

06:59.795 --> 07:02.266
You mean a field
assignment, sir?

07:02.301 --> 07:04.304
Yes, i've come to believe
that a man of your peculiar

07:04.339 --> 07:07.810
talents could be a
boon to us on this manhunt.

07:07.845 --> 07:10.783
I'm honoured, sir.

07:10.818 --> 07:14.074
We've tracked the signal to
several possible sources around

07:14.109 --> 07:17.330
the country and we've deployed
agent teams to investigate.

07:17.365 --> 07:20.102
These are your fcc credentials.

07:20.137 --> 07:22.841
See what you
can uncover at wxtv.

07:23.343 --> 07:24.810
Thank you, sir.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.349
I won't let you down.

07:37.871 --> 07:39.840
Pretty scary-looking,
if you ask me.

07:39.875 --> 07:41.879
Ah, he's just
a new mutant trying to get a
handle on his new abilities.

07:41.915 --> 07:43.384
He's scared.

07:43.884 --> 07:48.393
You can be that sympathetic
even after he almost
killed you and shalimar?

07:48.428 --> 07:50.361
It was an accident.

07:50.396 --> 07:52.401
Yeah, well that doesn't mean
you wouldn't kick the crap out

07:52.436 --> 07:53.904
of him if given half the chance.

07:53.939 --> 07:55.372
Yeah.

07:55.407 --> 07:57.411
Sympathy's one thing but this
guy's definitely asking for

07:57.446 --> 07:59.183
serious whoop-ass.

07:59.218 --> 08:00.918
Oh, hey, tough guy.

08:00.953 --> 08:03.390
Are you ready?

08:03.425 --> 08:05.893
Yeah, whenever you are.

08:05.928 --> 08:08.434
Well, we've got about
a half dozen different
frames to work with, right?

08:08.935 --> 08:11.941
So we're going to take
those images and try to work

08:11.976 --> 08:13.945
backwards to see what
he really looks like.

08:13.980 --> 08:16.916
It's kind of like
educated guesswork.

08:16.951 --> 08:18.955
You know, in a weird sort of
way, what you're doing with the

08:18.990 --> 08:21.459
computer is like what
i do with my telepathy.

08:22.962 --> 08:25.469
Well, you've got a
bunch of images and
you've got to figure

08:25.504 --> 08:27.473
out how they fit together
and what they mean.

08:27.508 --> 08:29.442
You want to
take a whack at it?

08:29.477 --> 08:32.482
I've never got a handle
on all that cyber stuff.

08:32.517 --> 08:34.452
Computers kind of
give me the creeps.

08:34.486 --> 08:36.491
Come on, i can't believe you
never did any playing around

08:37.994 --> 08:40.499
not everybody
was born with a silver
spoon in their mouth, jess.

08:40.534 --> 08:42.467
No, it's not that.

08:42.501 --> 08:46.512
My parents were real organic
types - macrobiotic food,

08:46.547 --> 08:48.981
solar power,
the whole deal.

08:49.016 --> 08:52.522
I grew up kind of uncomfortable
around anything mechanical.

08:52.558 --> 08:55.027
Well, you seem to do all
right in the lab with adam.

08:55.062 --> 08:56.496
Well, that's different.

08:56.531 --> 08:58.536
You know, i guess it's got
to do with the whole organic

08:58.571 --> 09:01.542
thing, dealing
with the human condition.

09:01.577 --> 09:04.046
How are we doing up there?

09:04.081 --> 09:05.550
Good.

09:06.050 --> 09:08.305
We uploaded all the images
we could from kilohertz's tv

09:08.340 --> 09:10.560
appearances, we put them
through the digital processor,

09:10.595 --> 09:12.062
broke them down,
put them together,

09:12.097 --> 09:13.065
and we'll see what we can get.

09:13.565 --> 09:14.533
Good.

09:14.568 --> 09:16.035
What's that?

09:16.070 --> 09:18.075
Well, it's just an idea at
this point, but i'm hoping it'll

09:18.110 --> 09:20.580
be a device that we can
use as a weapon against him.

09:20.615 --> 09:22.549
So light a fire under it.

09:22.585 --> 09:25.590
No telling when this guy
might plan to strike again.

09:25.626 --> 09:27.093
Right.

09:35.109 --> 09:36.577
I can assure you, mr. Renfield,

09:36.612 --> 09:39.619
we had absolutely
nothing to do with any
of the signal interruptions.

09:40.120 --> 09:42.088
I'll still need full
access to station records.

09:42.123 --> 09:44.128
We know for a fact that this
kilohertz used a local station

09:44.629 --> 09:46.597
to hack into
the network grid.

09:46.632 --> 09:48.136
You'll have to
file a written request,

09:48.637 --> 09:51.108
just like it
says in the handbook.

09:51.143 --> 09:53.612
We've got an emergency
situation here, harv'.

09:53.647 --> 09:56.654
This kilohertz character
could hold the country hostage.

09:57.154 --> 09:58.121
Fine.

09:58.156 --> 09:59.157
You want to investigate us?

09:59.192 --> 10:00.626
Do it by the book.

10:00.661 --> 10:03.669
Now, i hoped we could avoid
initiate a license revocation.

10:03.704 --> 10:05.671
You're putting
us out of business?

10:06.172 --> 10:09.142
Well,
if that's what it takes.

10:09.177 --> 10:13.689
I want your superior's
name and number now.

10:13.724 --> 10:15.959
Sorry.

10:15.994 --> 10:18.196
I got it.

10:40.743 --> 10:42.711
Mr. Goffman?

10:42.746 --> 10:44.249
Are you in there?

10:44.752 --> 10:46.755
Mr. Goffman?

10:53.769 --> 10:56.274
"Excuse me"
mean anything to you?

10:57.778 --> 10:59.746
This doesn't
have the number on it.

10:59.781 --> 11:03.789
Mr. Goffman, i got
the tapes you asked for.

11:03.824 --> 11:06.796
What happened
to that fcc guy?

11:07.296 --> 11:09.767
Fcc?

11:09.802 --> 11:11.771
The jerk tried
to strong-arm me.

11:11.806 --> 11:14.812
Thought we
had something to do with
this kilohertz thing.

11:14.847 --> 11:16.817
Fcc.

11:23.830 --> 11:25.833
That is so cool.

11:26.335 --> 11:28.841
Well, then we cross-reference
these potentials
with adam's database.

11:28.876 --> 11:31.344
So we'll know which new
mutant we're dealing with.

11:31.847 --> 11:33.314
A- ha.

11:33.349 --> 11:35.318
Sure you don't
want to give it a shot?

11:35.353 --> 11:37.860
I guarantee once you get the
hang of it, you'll be hooked.

11:37.895 --> 11:39.362
Okay.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.373
Ha ha.

11:45.408 --> 11:46.841
Okay.

11:46.876 --> 11:48.379
Put your
hands on gently.

11:48.415 --> 11:50.349
Yeah, one hand there.

11:50.384 --> 11:52.387
Wait,
it's going too fast.

11:52.422 --> 11:54.392
Not for the computer.

11:59.904 --> 12:02.407
Hey, that first
one's kind of cute.

12:02.442 --> 12:06.416
Ah, well,
the cute one it is.

12:10.425 --> 12:12.895
Hey.

12:12.930 --> 12:14.933
Barry sterling.

12:15.434 --> 12:17.438
Works at channel thirteen.

12:17.473 --> 12:19.910
Production assistant.

12:19.945 --> 12:22.951
What better
place for a video vandal
to develop his resentments?

12:23.450 --> 12:24.954
And act on them too.

12:24.990 --> 12:25.921
All right.

12:25.956 --> 12:27.459
Brennan, i want you and
emma to invite mr. Sterling

12:27.960 --> 12:28.962
over here to be our guest.

12:28.997 --> 12:30.430
You got it.

12:30.465 --> 12:31.933
Now, let's
not get too cocky.

12:31.968 --> 12:34.473
He may be the most powerful new
mutant we've ever come across.

12:34.975 --> 12:37.479
Definitely the most volatile.

13:01.028 --> 13:02.531
Here we go.

13:10.046 --> 13:11.048
You barry sterling?

13:11.548 --> 13:13.052
I've got nothing
to say to the fcc.

13:13.087 --> 13:14.554
Fcc?

14:06.160 --> 14:08.664
Well, something tells
me we found our boy.

14:08.699 --> 14:10.669
Now we've just
got to find him again.

14:10.704 --> 14:12.672
Figure out
a way to keep him.

14:27.837 --> 14:29.806
He gave us the slip, adam.

14:29.841 --> 14:32.811
The weird thing was
he thought we were fcc.

14:32.846 --> 14:35.316
Yeah, but before we got
to talk to him, he took off.

14:35.351 --> 14:37.856
All that was left of him was
a glow on the satellite dish.

14:37.891 --> 14:39.878
Well, now we know
how he gets around.

14:39.913 --> 14:41.866
It was actually
pretty incredible.

14:41.901 --> 14:43.333
Yeah,
but it was sloppy.

14:43.368 --> 14:45.874
You know, he left
a lot of residual energy
just buzzing on the dish.

14:45.909 --> 14:48.395
Seems like he doesn't
have a lot of control
over his abilities.

14:48.430 --> 14:51.159
Well, that would
account for all the
collateral damage that

14:51.194 --> 14:53.889
his vandalism's causing, you
know, how he invades a network

14:53.924 --> 14:56.412
grid and accidentally
takes out a hospital's power.

14:56.447 --> 14:58.899
But his thinking that
you're both members of the fcc,

14:59.401 --> 15:01.907
i think he's run
into somebody from the gsa

15:01.942 --> 15:03.909
operating under
false credentials.

15:03.944 --> 15:05.413
So eckhart's after him too.

15:05.914 --> 15:07.918
Yeah, and he got there first.

15:07.952 --> 15:09.420
Yeah.

15:17.938 --> 15:19.441
I can't tell you how grateful
i am for this opportunity, sir.

15:19.942 --> 15:21.912
Don't come any closer.

15:21.947 --> 15:24.917
Keep your distance
until i am sealed.

15:24.952 --> 15:27.457
If all you've got to share
with me is gratitude,

15:27.492 --> 15:30.964
mr. Renfield, i'm busy.

15:30.999 --> 15:32.433
No, sir.

15:32.468 --> 15:34.472
I just wanted to report
my data retrieval at wxtv.

15:34.973 --> 15:36.942
Well, go ahead.

15:36.977 --> 15:40.985
I'm not sure
i understand, sir.

15:41.020 --> 15:43.256
Report.

15:43.291 --> 15:45.144
I did, sir.

15:45.180 --> 15:46.998
That was it.

15:47.497 --> 15:51.471
Mr. Renfield, i understand
they teach a very specific

15:51.506 --> 15:55.515
keep-your-superiors-
in-the-loop kind of
procedure at the academy.

15:55.550 --> 15:57.518
In the real world, i don't want
to hear about anything until

15:58.020 --> 16:01.026
the job has been
done, regardless of your
pathetic people-pleasing.

16:01.061 --> 16:02.529
Sorry, sir.

16:03.029 --> 16:04.033
I don't want apologies,
mr. Renfield.

16:04.068 --> 16:05.535
I want results.

16:06.036 --> 16:08.041
Every day this anomaly is at
large endangers our mission.

16:08.076 --> 16:10.044
It's time you justified my
faith in you and put an end to

16:10.544 --> 16:12.047
his reign of terror.

16:46.618 --> 16:49.589
Freaks of the world,
you can call me kilohertz.

16:49.624 --> 16:53.130
And it's time to step up to
the plate and answer the big

16:53.165 --> 16:56.638
question: When are we going
to start breaking the law of

16:56.673 --> 17:00.111
averages and start taking
what is rightfully ours?

17:00.146 --> 17:03.653
It's all those pitifully
average ones keeping us in our

17:03.688 --> 17:07.160
place while we keep hiding
in plain sight, waiting for

17:07.194 --> 17:10.632
someone to notice us.

17:10.666 --> 17:15.175
Well, i'm here to give notice
and we're not hiding anymore.

17:15.211 --> 17:19.150
I'm calling out to all of you

17:19.185 --> 17:24.695
- the odd, the weird,
the misplaced, the displaced.

17:24.731 --> 17:26.663
Our time is now.

17:26.698 --> 17:29.205
We freaks, we can do anything,
ut it's the normal ones who

17:29.240 --> 17:31.174
control this world.

17:31.209 --> 17:35.217
But we have the power to take
over, so when the hell are we

17:35.252 --> 17:39.224
going to shove them aside and
take what's rightfully ours?

17:39.259 --> 17:42.232
Because we're not going away.

17:50.248 --> 17:52.752
Barry sterling.

17:56.259 --> 18:00.017
I tried to invite kilohertz on
the show but he said the circus

18:00.052 --> 18:03.774
was coming to wall street
and he was off to ride the bear.

18:03.809 --> 18:06.245
He's going to hit
the stock market.

18:06.280 --> 18:09.286
This guy could start another
depression single-handed.

18:09.321 --> 18:12.257
We've got to start thinking
of kilohertz as a virus.

18:12.292 --> 18:14.797
Jesse, you and i are going to
build a firewall maze around

18:14.832 --> 18:16.801
the financial databases,
try to hold him back.

18:16.837 --> 18:18.769
Do you want us to go to barry's?

18:18.805 --> 18:21.310
Afraid the
tele-empathic approach
will only get us so far.

18:21.345 --> 18:23.315
Time to get physical?

18:23.350 --> 18:24.282
Yeah.

18:24.317 --> 18:25.819
I want you and brennan
to get over there.

18:25.855 --> 18:26.822
You're up this time.

18:26.857 --> 18:27.823
Let's go.

18:30.829 --> 18:31.831
Come with me.

18:32.332 --> 18:33.836
I can't imagine a better
way to get your feet wet.

18:38.345 --> 18:40.849
Financial markets are already
reacting to kilohertz's threat.

18:53.375 --> 18:54.843
Everything looks okay.

18:54.878 --> 18:56.382
Yeah, well,
just give it a minute.

19:00.390 --> 19:02.393
There, you see the market
is ninety percent perception.

19:02.429 --> 19:04.397
Looking solvent is almost
as important as being solvent.

19:04.432 --> 19:05.401
Well, can't we do anything?

19:05.900 --> 19:06.903
Done the best i can.

19:07.404 --> 19:08.872
The firewall won't stop him.

19:08.907 --> 19:11.412
It'll only keep things
from falling completely apart.

19:22.935 --> 19:25.905
Any doubt in your mind
maybe he's not kilohertz?

19:25.940 --> 19:28.947
Well, if that's
the case, we're not the
only ones who got it wrong.

19:42.475 --> 19:43.978
Come on.

19:59.009 --> 20:00.762
Let's try to show
a little restraint.

20:00.798 --> 20:02.516
We can do this
without hurting him.

20:08.026 --> 20:09.530
There he is.

20:42.597 --> 20:44.602
Yeah, yeah, i know
exactly how you feel.

20:44.637 --> 20:45.602
I've been through this already.

20:46.104 --> 20:47.106
Come on.

21:02.137 --> 21:04.106
Our first guest has his
own take on the wild ride the

21:04.141 --> 21:07.112
market's
taking today, the result
of rumours of a threatened

21:07.147 --> 21:11.655
electronic invasion
by the terrorist who
calls himself kilohertz.

21:11.690 --> 21:14.161
Please welcome one
of sheldrake and martin's

21:14.196 --> 21:16.934
most respected
financial analysts...

21:16.969 --> 21:19.673
me, and the
rumours are all true.

21:20.172 --> 21:22.678
I'm warning every freak out
there to pull out their cash.

21:23.179 --> 21:26.185
But until they do, i'm going
to move a little money around

21:26.687 --> 21:29.441
myself and kick
some wall street ass.

21:29.476 --> 21:32.196
Mr. Renfield,
are you watching this?

21:32.231 --> 21:34.167
Watching it now, sir.

21:34.202 --> 21:37.208
So forget
about your life savings
and forget about the meek

21:37.243 --> 21:38.676
inheriting the earth.

21:38.711 --> 21:41.966
There's nothing meek about me
or any other freaks out there

21:42.001 --> 21:45.367
who're going to follow my lead,
because it's the freaks who

21:45.402 --> 21:48.731
are going to own this planet
because we're not going away.

21:48.766 --> 21:51.737
Did you see that, mr. Renfield?

21:51.772 --> 21:53.706
Yes, sir.

21:53.741 --> 21:57.750
I want this maniac
in custody or your career
is over before it's begun.

22:02.760 --> 22:04.227
Jesse, i can't
find him on the grid.

22:04.262 --> 22:06.266
I need you to give me a complete
damage report immediately.

22:07.770 --> 22:09.273
Well,
as far as i can tell,
he's out of the system,

22:09.308 --> 22:11.242
but he's left
a lot of damage behind.

22:11.276 --> 22:13.245
The nasdaq and the
dow jones are plummeting.

22:13.280 --> 22:17.253
Well if he's gone, why
is everything still going crazy?

22:17.289 --> 22:19.794
Well, because
like i said, the market is
ninety percent perception.

22:19.829 --> 22:21.798
And right now,
the perception is the
bottom's fallen out and

22:22.299 --> 22:24.267
there's nobody
there to stop the plunge.

22:24.303 --> 22:25.806
And in this case,
unfortunately, they're right.

22:25.841 --> 22:27.308
When he tore through
the market databases,

22:27.343 --> 22:29.331
he trashed all of the stopgaps.

22:29.366 --> 22:31.317
But i thought
you guys built a...

22:32.821 --> 22:35.325
we did,
but i underestimated his power
and he breached the firewall.

22:35.360 --> 22:38.798
So jesse, it's up to us now
to initiate some damage control.

22:38.833 --> 22:43.843
I need you to use
the sanctuary system to try
to stabilize the markets.

22:43.878 --> 22:45.811
Try to rebuild
the stopgap from inside.

22:45.846 --> 22:47.851
I just hope he doesn't
decide to make a return visit

22:48.351 --> 22:49.856
while i'm doing the repairs.

23:28.934 --> 23:30.938
Barry.

23:32.943 --> 23:34.445
Kilohertz.

23:34.947 --> 23:36.449
Who the hell are you?

23:36.950 --> 23:38.955
Hey, wait a minute.

23:39.455 --> 23:40.923
You're that fcc guy.

23:40.958 --> 23:42.963
Nick renfield,
genetic security agency.

23:42.998 --> 23:45.432
I was undercover
as an fcc rep.

23:45.467 --> 23:50.979
I want to tell you,
i really love where
you're coming from.

23:51.014 --> 23:55.487
All of us freaks, we
have to stick together.

23:55.523 --> 23:57.993
Thanks, man.

23:58.494 --> 24:02.501
Are you really a freak, or is
that just a figure of speech?

24:58.616 --> 25:01.121
All right, when do i
get to look at the place?

25:01.157 --> 25:02.124
Jeez,
settle down, settle down.

25:02.624 --> 25:05.095
Hold still.

25:05.130 --> 25:10.105
Man, this is off the meter.

25:10.140 --> 25:14.148
Jeez, if you're so jazzed to
be here, why didn't you just

25:14.648 --> 25:16.617
come with us
in the first place?

25:16.653 --> 25:18.656
Well,
you never told me you were
with mutant x. And besides,

25:19.159 --> 25:21.127
i wanted to see how
i screwed up the economy.

25:21.162 --> 25:23.667
Well,
sorry about that but adam
increased the market stopgap

25:23.702 --> 25:26.171
measures to prevent the
dow from falling any more than

25:26.207 --> 25:27.640
two thousand points.

25:27.675 --> 25:29.679
Well, you can't
blame me for trying.

25:29.714 --> 25:32.685
Who's adam?

25:33.186 --> 25:35.156
That would be me.

25:35.191 --> 25:39.199
You caused a lot
of trouble for a lot of
people out there, barry.

25:39.234 --> 25:42.205
Besides your vandalism of
the stock market, i've just been

25:42.706 --> 25:45.711
reading reports on the havoc
that you caused at the airports.

25:45.746 --> 25:47.716
Things happen.

25:47.751 --> 25:48.985
Hey.

25:49.021 --> 25:50.221
Hey.

25:50.722 --> 25:52.190
Somebody's got
to tell the truth.

25:52.225 --> 25:53.728
I mean, that's why
you brought me here, right?

25:53.763 --> 25:55.696
Mutant x, kilohertz.

25:55.731 --> 25:57.200
Ever since i
heard about you guys,

25:57.234 --> 25:59.739
i knew sooner or later
you'd hook up with me.

25:59.774 --> 26:01.244
That was pretty cool.

26:01.745 --> 26:04.751
When you threw those lightning
bolts at those guys in my place.

26:04.785 --> 26:05.751
Well, you know what?

26:06.254 --> 26:07.220
What?

26:07.255 --> 26:08.257
You throw energy.

26:08.759 --> 26:09.760
I am energy.

26:09.795 --> 26:11.228
Wow.

26:11.263 --> 26:12.766
Your parents must
be really proud of you.

26:13.268 --> 26:14.269
Yeah.

26:20.282 --> 26:25.292
I gather your hesitation allowed
kilohertz to elude our grasp?

26:25.327 --> 26:29.567
That is a complete misread
of the situation, mr. Eckhart.

26:29.602 --> 26:33.809
Frankly, i'm concerned about
the empathy you seem to have

26:33.844 --> 26:37.282
developed for this renegade.

26:37.317 --> 26:42.827
I believe he is
a dangerous anomaly that
should be neutralized.

26:42.862 --> 26:44.797
Nice recitation
of the manual,

26:44.832 --> 26:47.302
mr. Renfield,
but hardly convincing.

26:47.337 --> 26:49.842
I'm afraid i might have
been a bit premature

26:49.877 --> 26:52.312
in rushing
you into the field.

26:52.347 --> 26:57.358
I think perhaps
you might need just
a little more training

26:57.393 --> 27:00.363
before you
go back on assignment.

27:31.927 --> 27:33.430
Freaks of the world,

27:33.931 --> 27:36.938
my name is kilohertz
and i'm here to speak to you,

27:36.973 --> 27:39.407
for you and about you.

27:39.444 --> 27:42.197
I have had it up to here
with the way we are treated.

27:42.231 --> 27:44.952
So consider this fair
warning, we have the power.

27:54.973 --> 27:57.443
Ah, barry...

27:57.478 --> 28:02.489
barry,
when you transform into radio
waves, what's your range?

28:02.990 --> 28:04.994
Without a
transmitting device?

28:05.496 --> 28:06.998
Nowhere.

28:07.498 --> 28:09.469
No, but with a
transmitting device?

28:09.504 --> 28:12.510
I surf the wavelength up to a
satellite, then bam, i'm in a

28:12.545 --> 28:15.516
million
homes across the country,
paving the way for the new

28:15.551 --> 28:17.519
mutants out there to come
out of their shells and take

28:18.020 --> 28:20.024
what's rightfully theirs.

28:23.030 --> 28:28.541
Now, where do
i sign on for mutant x's
minister of propaganda?

28:28.576 --> 28:31.549
What?

28:32.049 --> 28:35.056
I don't mean to get all pushy,
but you need someone like me

28:35.091 --> 28:37.023
to shake things up a little.

28:37.058 --> 28:39.063
Barry, do you have any
idea how many people have

28:39.098 --> 28:40.531
suffered because of you?

28:40.566 --> 28:42.070
I'm just doing
what you're doing.

28:42.105 --> 28:43.088
Oh, yeah?

28:43.123 --> 28:44.038
How is that?

28:44.073 --> 28:45.541
Keeping the faith.

28:45.577 --> 28:47.079
Reminding the freaks out there
that they've got the power

28:47.581 --> 28:48.548
if they're willing to...

28:48.582 --> 28:50.085
to step up to
the plate and use it.

28:50.587 --> 28:51.553
All right, fine.

28:51.589 --> 28:54.094
You want to make the world
better for new mutants, then you

28:54.129 --> 28:56.599
just stop what you're doing
because every act of vandalism,

28:56.634 --> 28:59.104
it just causes more
prejudice against new mutants,

28:59.139 --> 29:02.109
prejudice against
anybody who's different.

29:02.144 --> 29:05.116
Is this
some kind of joke?

29:05.151 --> 29:06.084
No, no, no.

29:06.119 --> 29:07.621
I'm deadly serious.

29:07.656 --> 29:09.124
I want you to stop.

29:10.126 --> 29:13.133
Either you're jealous
or you're a sell-out
like the rest of them.

29:13.168 --> 29:14.134
Listen, you little...

29:14.169 --> 29:15.102
no!

29:15.137 --> 29:16.605
Nobody shuts me up.

29:16.640 --> 29:18.142
You don't want
me on your side?

29:18.177 --> 29:19.144
Fine.

29:19.646 --> 29:21.148
But you do not want
me as an enemy either.

29:21.183 --> 29:23.152
I'm out of here.

29:26.159 --> 29:27.661
Hey, barry, we
let you out of here,

29:27.696 --> 29:29.165
the gsa's going
to hunt you down.

29:29.200 --> 29:30.132
Yeah?

29:30.167 --> 29:31.669
I talked to
one of those guys.

29:31.704 --> 29:33.172
They appreciate
what i can do.

29:33.674 --> 29:36.179
Get the hell
out of my way.

29:45.197 --> 29:47.202
I wanted to do that
for a long time.

29:47.237 --> 29:49.205
I know exactly how you feel.

29:53.214 --> 29:54.717
This'll knock him out for
about twelve hours so we can

29:54.752 --> 29:56.686
figure out what to do with him.

29:56.721 --> 29:58.224
Why don't you take
him back into the lab

29:58.259 --> 29:59.728
and keep him
quarantine, huh?

29:59.763 --> 30:01.230
Thank you.

30:37.570 --> 30:41.078
Well, his dna's cellular
structure's completely unstable.

30:41.113 --> 30:43.547
It's caught in a flux
between matter and energy.

30:43.582 --> 30:47.088
Talk about
unstable in flux, you ought
to see him through my eyes.

30:47.123 --> 30:49.862
This guy is
an emotional time bomb

30:49.897 --> 30:52.601
with no
self-control whatsoever.

30:53.101 --> 30:55.606
What are we
going to do with him?

30:55.641 --> 30:57.074
I have no idea.

30:57.109 --> 31:00.617
What scares
me is when he realizes the
full extent of his powers,

31:00.653 --> 31:05.126
then decides to wield those
powers with lethal intent.

31:14.144 --> 31:17.651
We can't keep him
sedated forever, adam.

31:17.687 --> 31:20.622
Shalimar's right.

31:20.657 --> 31:23.162
Yeah, well, like you
always say, we're not cops.

31:23.197 --> 31:24.631
Thank god for that.

31:24.666 --> 31:26.670
I'd be in
serious trouble.

31:26.705 --> 31:28.638
I wish i had an answer.

31:28.673 --> 31:30.678
What about a
subdermal governor?

31:34.184 --> 31:35.152
What?

31:35.187 --> 31:36.689
You want to
play eckhart's game?

31:36.724 --> 31:38.158
Come on, jesse,
you've had one.

31:38.193 --> 31:40.447
Do you really want to
put anyone else through that?

31:40.482 --> 31:42.667
We all know it's a problem,
but like adam said,

31:42.702 --> 31:46.174
what happens when barry
decides to get really nasty?

31:46.209 --> 31:49.716
Yeah, where did this
gsa-is-a-okay business
come from, anyway?

31:49.751 --> 31:52.722
Personally,
i can't see barry and
eckhart hitting it off.

31:52.757 --> 31:55.227
But stranger
things have happened.

31:55.729 --> 31:58.198
Well, that's one strange thing
i don't want to be around for.

31:58.233 --> 32:01.741
All right, look,
i know how we all feel
about subdermal governors,

32:01.775 --> 32:04.748
but under the circumstances,

32:05.247 --> 32:07.251
i think we're
justified in using one

32:07.287 --> 32:09.256
- as a temporary solution.

32:59.357 --> 33:01.327
How'd he get out?

33:01.362 --> 33:03.867
His altered state
must have undercut the
sedative's effectiveness.

33:03.902 --> 33:05.334
Barry,
you've got to listen.

33:05.370 --> 33:07.338
Leaving here would
be a huge mistake.

33:07.373 --> 33:10.345
Thinking you were the
good guys was my big mistake.

33:10.380 --> 33:13.888
And since you don't give a damn
about my future - or yours -

33:13.923 --> 33:16.659
i think it's time
we part company and

33:16.694 --> 33:19.398
i step up to
the big leagues, baby.

33:23.406 --> 33:24.910
Neat trick.

33:25.410 --> 33:26.913
All right, brennan,
jesse, come with me.

33:34.930 --> 33:37.399
Mr. Goffman?

33:37.434 --> 33:39.438
Where the hell have you been?

33:39.473 --> 33:41.443
Where haven't i been, harv'?

33:41.478 --> 33:43.446
Do you play the market?

33:43.481 --> 33:45.416
Yeah.

33:45.451 --> 33:47.956
Then i guarantee that
i cost you a bundle yesterday.

33:47.991 --> 33:50.963
It's you.

33:51.463 --> 33:53.467
You're kilohertz.

33:53.501 --> 33:54.935
Yeah.

33:54.971 --> 33:56.474
That fcc guy was right.

33:56.509 --> 33:57.977
Yeah, but he wasn't fcc.

33:58.012 --> 33:58.943
And you know what?

33:58.978 --> 34:00.948
I'm through being your lackey.

34:00.983 --> 34:02.987
The only reason i'm here
is to use your satellite dish

34:03.022 --> 34:08.498
because tonight,
i'm going international.

34:08.533 --> 34:11.003
I'm calling
the authorities.

34:11.038 --> 34:12.471
Woo-woo-woo.

34:12.505 --> 34:13.974
Take your best shot.

34:14.009 --> 34:15.476
They haven't caught me yet.

34:15.512 --> 34:19.018
By the time they get
here, i will be long gone.

34:19.054 --> 34:20.487
No, you won't.

34:20.522 --> 34:25.496
Well, if it isn't everyone's
favourite sell-out.

34:25.532 --> 34:28.036
I want you to come back to
the sanctuary with me, barry.

34:28.538 --> 34:29.505
Why?

34:29.541 --> 34:31.009
So you can
lock me up again?

34:31.043 --> 34:33.047
No, just want to talk,
try to work things out.

34:33.083 --> 34:34.516
The hell with that.

34:34.551 --> 34:37.056
I'm going to go check
out the power grid.

34:44.572 --> 34:46.074
Brennan, here he comes.

34:58.599 --> 35:00.067
Jesse.

35:00.102 --> 35:01.570
Got him, brennan.

35:01.605 --> 35:03.609
Do you really
think you can hold me?

35:03.644 --> 35:05.078
Shalimar?

35:05.113 --> 35:07.117
Whenever you're ready.

35:07.152 --> 35:10.624
Transmitting now.

35:16.136 --> 35:17.638
I got him.

35:18.140 --> 35:20.644
Don't you know who i think i am?

35:20.679 --> 35:22.147
Oh, shut up.

35:25.153 --> 35:27.158
It worked, adam.

35:27.658 --> 35:29.127
He's frozen on the screen.

35:29.162 --> 35:32.168
Yeah, catching
lightning in a bottle.

35:32.203 --> 35:33.635
Yeah.

35:33.670 --> 35:35.173
Now,
let's keep him there.

35:56.716 --> 35:57.719
Everything secure?

35:57.754 --> 35:58.686
Yeah.

35:58.721 --> 35:59.724
Lock-down
still in effect.

35:59.759 --> 36:02.193
Good.

36:02.228 --> 36:07.238
But you don't know who or what
you're dealing with or else

36:07.273 --> 36:11.247
you wouldn't have bothered
with all the extra junk.

36:20.766 --> 36:23.773
Now, don't you wish
we'd all gotten along?

36:31.289 --> 36:32.791
Maybe then you wouldn't
be looking at your worst virus

36:33.291 --> 36:35.296
nightmare come to life.

36:44.147 --> 36:46.116
You're wasting your time.

36:46.151 --> 36:48.156
He accessed the password
files when he was in the system.

36:48.190 --> 36:50.158
You got that right
and i'm here to stay.

36:50.660 --> 36:53.918
And forget about countermanding
the security code because

36:53.953 --> 36:57.173
i've locked access, so it's
just us for as long as i like.

37:00.179 --> 37:01.146
All right,
forget about that.

37:01.181 --> 37:02.685
Let's find a way to bypass
his control of the system.

37:03.186 --> 37:04.152
Right.

37:04.187 --> 37:05.656
Hey, you know what
your problem is, pal?

37:05.692 --> 37:07.659
You've got way too much
spare time on your hands.

37:07.695 --> 37:11.166
The only problem i've got
is the mistake i made about you,

37:11.201 --> 37:17.214
thinking you
were heroes as opposed to a
bunch of posers and losers.

37:17.249 --> 37:20.687
I loved this place
from the minute i saw it.

37:20.722 --> 37:24.229
So i figured it'd be fun to
take it apart and put it back

37:24.264 --> 37:29.239
together -
virtually speaking, that is.

37:37.254 --> 37:39.259
But i'm not the one who's
going to run out of oxygen now

37:39.294 --> 37:41.765
that i cut off the
air intake system, now am i?

37:49.279 --> 37:51.282
Ooh, no one to hit, huh, honey?

37:51.317 --> 37:53.805
No one to zap, huh, pal?

37:53.840 --> 37:56.258
No one to push around.

37:56.293 --> 37:59.300
And you,
you can ghost or granite,
don't mean a thing to me.

38:04.811 --> 38:07.316
Now, the gsa, the minute i
show up, they'll treat me like a

38:07.351 --> 38:09.285
conquering hero.

38:09.320 --> 38:10.823
You really think they'll
let you continue this rampage?

38:11.324 --> 38:13.578
Well, i'd sooner go where
my talents are appreciated.

38:13.613 --> 38:15.833
No, no, no, they're going
to turn you into a weapon.

38:16.334 --> 38:17.803
They'll crush you like a bug.

38:17.838 --> 38:19.841
The guy i talked to said they'd
love to have me on their team

38:19.876 --> 38:21.846
- especially after
i've taken you down.

38:25.853 --> 38:26.820
But you know what?

38:26.855 --> 38:28.358
You might have a point.

38:28.861 --> 38:30.864
So instead of joining gsa,
i'll just take them over.

38:31.365 --> 38:33.869
Nothing like starting
from the top, huh?

38:33.904 --> 38:36.374
Haven't you heard
"resistance is futile"?

38:38.881 --> 38:40.884
I know what you're doing.

38:41.386 --> 38:42.854
It's a waste of time.

38:42.889 --> 38:45.392
Overloading the mainframe
to get past my firewall?

38:45.427 --> 38:47.362
That's absolutely right.

38:47.397 --> 38:49.401
But it's going to trap
you in here permanently.

38:49.436 --> 38:51.907
You're bluffing.

38:51.942 --> 38:53.875
Try me.

38:53.910 --> 38:56.415
Brennan, hit the mainframe
with everything you've got.

38:58.920 --> 39:01.927
Got to go, but i'll be back
with my new gsa best friends.

39:04.431 --> 39:06.937
Brennan,
hit the comlink system now.

39:15.956 --> 39:17.458
Good work, brennan.

39:20.463 --> 39:22.469
I've reconfigured the comlink
system so he'll never find his

39:22.504 --> 39:24.472
way back in again.

39:28.481 --> 39:30.986
Can i assume your experience
in retraining has had no

39:31.021 --> 39:33.491
detrimental effects
on you, mr. Renfield?

39:33.526 --> 39:34.994
Not at all, sir.

39:35.494 --> 39:37.463
I can't imagine what
got into me, mr. Eckhart.

39:37.498 --> 39:40.004
The answer to that is found
in your genetic misfortune.

39:40.039 --> 39:42.975
The very gift that makes
you so special leaves you

39:43.010 --> 39:46.016
vulnerable to huxters and
charlatans who want nothing more

39:46.051 --> 39:47.985
than your utter corruption.

39:48.020 --> 39:51.027
I understand,
sir, and i've renewed
my vows of commitment

39:51.062 --> 39:52.994
to constant vigilance.

39:53.029 --> 39:59.042
Does that mean i can assume
you're ready to go back to work?

39:59.544 --> 40:02.014
Absolutely.

40:02.049 --> 40:05.055
I'm ready to take on whatever
you have to offer, sir.

40:19.083 --> 40:20.587
Security.

40:23.592 --> 40:26.098
Now this is what
i'm talking about.

40:26.598 --> 40:28.602
I'll handle this.

40:32.610 --> 40:34.615
Hey, it's good to see you.

40:40.125 --> 40:44.134
I thought you guys
would be glad to see me.

40:44.635 --> 40:46.640
Glad to see you, barry?

40:53.153 --> 40:55.156
We're thrilled.

41:04.175 --> 41:07.180
Nicely done, mr. Renfield.

41:14.195 --> 41:16.699
So kilohertz turns out
to be a computer geek loser

41:17.201 --> 41:18.704
who ate a bullet
when the cops...

41:18.739 --> 41:20.173
mute.

41:20.208 --> 41:21.710
You got to give eckhart credit.

41:22.211 --> 41:23.179
Yeah, really.

41:23.214 --> 41:24.716
When he lies to the press,
he doesn't screw around.

41:25.217 --> 41:27.722
Well, we lost one today,
ladies and gentlemen.

41:27.757 --> 41:29.191
I'm not so certain.

41:29.226 --> 41:31.230
I mean, you kicked his butt,
albeit in the nick of time.

41:31.264 --> 41:33.234
You saved the day, adam.

41:33.735 --> 41:35.738
No,
i was thinking about barry.

41:35.773 --> 41:37.707
He had some good ideas.

41:37.742 --> 41:40.498
We lost somebody who could've
been an important ally,

41:40.533 --> 41:44.148
except he got carried away
by his own sense of power.

41:44.183 --> 41:47.763
Let's just hope his loss
doesn't come back to haunt us.
