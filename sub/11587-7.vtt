00:05.373 --> 00:08.576
- IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE
SYSTEM, SEXUALLY BASED OFFENSES

00:08.576 --> 00:11.145
ARE CONSIDERED
ESPECIALLY HEINOUS.

00:11.145 --> 00:13.347
IN NEW YORK CITY,
THE DEDICATED DETECTIVES

00:13.347 --> 00:15.249
WHO INVESTIGATE
THESE VICIOUS FELONIES

00:15.249 --> 00:17.051
ARE MEMBERS OF AN ELITE SQUAD

00:17.051 --> 00:18.819
KNOWN AS THE SPECIAL
VICTIMS UNIT.

00:18.819 --> 00:21.122
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:24.125 --> 00:26.160
- COME ON.
MOVE YOUR FEET.

00:26.160 --> 00:28.396
- OH.

00:28.396 --> 00:30.698
- YEAH, I SPOKE
TO THE M.E. AND--

00:30.698 --> 00:32.466
EXCUSE ME. SORRY.
- UH...

00:32.466 --> 00:34.535
YOU WORK HERE?
- HOLD UP, CAPTAIN.

00:34.535 --> 00:36.237
- I NEED TO TALK
TO A DETECTIVE.

00:36.237 --> 00:37.705
- YOU CAN TALK TO ME.
I'M DETECTIVE AMARO.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.840
JUST TAKE A SEAT AT MY DESK.
YEAH.

00:39.840 --> 00:42.210
- IT'S ABOUT THIS LETTER
WHICH I RECEIVED.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.345
- A LETTER.
LOOK, IN A FEW MINUTES.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.114
JUST SIT TIGHT.
YEAH, CAPTAIN.

00:46.114 --> 00:48.482
ON YOUR DESK.
YEAH, I'LL CHECK.

00:48.482 --> 00:50.084
RIGHT HERE, SIR.

00:50.084 --> 00:51.352
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHO YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

00:51.352 --> 00:52.720
- COME WITH ME.

00:52.720 --> 00:54.322
[loud thud]
- COME ON, MAN!

00:54.322 --> 00:55.723
- SIR, SIT DOWN.
- LET GO OF ME.

00:55.723 --> 00:57.391
- YOU'RE LYING,
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

00:57.391 --> 00:59.427
- SHE IS CERTIFIABLE.
- THAT IS ENOUGH.

00:59.427 --> 01:01.662
BOTH OF YOU STOP.
TONI, HAVE A SEAT.

01:01.662 --> 01:03.631
CAN YOU PLEASE TELL ME
EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAW.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.399
- HE WAS IN MY DAUGHTER'S
BEDROOM.

01:05.399 --> 01:06.767
- YOU'RE SAFE NOW, OKAY?

01:06.767 --> 01:08.269
WE'RE GONNA TAKE YOU
TO THE HOSPITAL.

01:08.269 --> 01:10.304
- LOCK HIM UP!
- I WAS JUST HOLDING HER.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.872
- HOLDING HER?
- OH! WHOA, WHOA!

01:11.872 --> 01:14.308
- HEY, TONI, ENOUGH.
SIT DOWN!

01:14.308 --> 01:15.876
- WHOA! HEY!
[overlapping shouting]

01:15.876 --> 01:17.711
- SHE'S CRAZY.
YOU SEE THAT?

01:19.480 --> 01:22.483
[woman sings in German
operatically]

01:22.483 --> 01:30.558
*

01:46.707 --> 01:51.145
[dramatic note]
- * AH

01:51.145 --> 01:53.414
- HAROLD LASSITER.
75.

01:53.414 --> 01:55.716
RETIRED PRIVATE SCHOOL
ENGLISH TEACHER.

01:55.716 --> 01:57.485
NEIGHBOR FOUND HIM.
- SUICIDE?

01:57.485 --> 02:00.221
HOW'D WE CATCH THIS?
- THEY FOUND MY CARD.

02:00.221 --> 02:01.722
HE MUST HAVE TAKEN IT
FROM MY DESK.

02:01.722 --> 02:03.691
HE CAME INTO THE SQUAD ROOM
LAST NIGHT.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.459
- LAST NIGHT?
IT WAS A ZOO.

02:05.459 --> 02:08.696
- YEAH, I BARELY SPOKE TO HIM.
- NICE WORK.

02:08.696 --> 02:11.899
WHAT'D HE WANT?
- WE DIDN'T GET THAT FAR.

02:11.899 --> 02:13.734
THIS LETTER WAS ON HIS DESK.

02:13.734 --> 02:16.237
- SUICIDE NOTE?

02:16.237 --> 02:17.905
- NO. I THINK HE HAD IT
WITH HIM LAST NIGHT.

02:17.905 --> 02:20.708
IT'S TO HIM.
"YOU ABUSED MY TRUST.

02:20.708 --> 02:24.212
"I CAN NEVER ERASE THE IMAGES
OF YOUR HANDS ON MY BODY,

02:24.212 --> 02:25.913
MR. LASSITER,
I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU."

02:25.913 --> 02:27.381
AND THEN HE QUOTES--

02:27.381 --> 02:29.617
"I AM LOST FOREVER
ON THE ENDLESS SEA."

02:29.617 --> 02:31.685
SIGNED CURT.
NO LAST NAME.

02:31.685 --> 02:34.388
- THE HANDWRITING APPEARS
DIFFERENT--"I AM SORRY."

02:34.388 --> 02:37.225
SO LASSITER
GETS CURT'S LETTER,

02:37.225 --> 02:38.859
COMES IN TO CONFESS,
AND THEN WHAT--

02:38.859 --> 02:41.195
DECIDES TO GO
A DIFFERENT WAY?

02:41.195 --> 02:45.599
- MAYBE. OR MAYBE CURT
DECIDED FOR HIM.

03:37.785 --> 03:39.320
- HAROLD LASSITER

03:39.320 --> 03:40.754
TAUGHT AT MANOR HILL ACADEMY
FOR OVER 30 YEARS.

03:40.754 --> 03:42.456
RETIRED IN '02.
- MANOR HILL?

03:42.456 --> 03:43.891
- FANCIEST SCHOOL IN THE CITY.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.826
25 ACRES UP IN RIVERDALE.
TENNIS COURTS.

03:45.826 --> 03:47.861
KID FROM MY BLOCK
GOT A SCHOLARSHIP THERE.

03:47.861 --> 03:50.431
OPENED DOORS.
- WELL, NOT FOR CURT.

03:50.431 --> 03:51.965
WE FOUND HIS LETTER
IN THE APARTMENT

03:51.965 --> 03:53.033
ALLEGING ABUSE.

03:53.033 --> 03:54.802
LISTEN TO THIS.

03:54.802 --> 03:57.738
"I WAS TOO YOUNG AND POWERLESS
TO SAY NO."

03:57.738 --> 03:59.440
- ONE OF LASSITER'S STUDENTS?

03:59.440 --> 04:01.709
- SO WHAT DO WE THINK?
CURT WENT THERE FOR A VISIT

04:01.709 --> 04:02.976
AND STAGED A SUICIDE?

04:02.976 --> 04:04.978
- HOLD ON. THERE WAS
NO SIGN OF A STRUGGLE.

04:04.978 --> 04:07.014
THE M.E.'S CHECKING TO SEE
IF HE WAS KILLED FIRST,

04:07.014 --> 04:08.816
THEN STRUNG UP.

04:08.816 --> 04:11.285
BUT SHE PUTS THE TIME OF DEATH
BETWEEN 9:00 AND MIDNIGHT.

04:11.285 --> 04:13.621
- SO IS CURT A VICTIM
OR A SUSPECT?

04:13.621 --> 04:14.755
- MAYBE BOTH--EITHER WAY,
WE GOTTA TRACK HIM DOWN.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.457
- WELL, HOW ARE WE
GONNA DO THAT?

04:16.457 --> 04:18.058
NO LAST NAME.
NO PRINT HITS FROM THE LETTER.

04:18.058 --> 04:19.693
- SO WE START WITH MANOR HILL,

04:19.693 --> 04:21.395
GET A LIST OF
LASSITER'S STUDENTS.

04:21.395 --> 04:22.830
- THINK SOMEBODY
UP AT THAT SCHOOL

04:22.830 --> 04:25.466
WANTS TO TALK ABOUT ABUSE?
HAVE A NICE DRIVE.

04:25.466 --> 04:28.869
- WE WILL. AND IN THE MEANTIME,
DETECTIVE TUTUOLA,

04:28.869 --> 04:31.372
WHY DON'T YOU CHECK IN ON YOUR
FRIEND WITH THE SCHOLARSHIP

04:31.372 --> 04:34.775
AND SEE IF THEY KNEW LASSITER
OR CURT.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.746
- MR. LASSITER TAUGHT
THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS.

04:38.746 --> 04:40.414
DO YOU HAVE A YEAR?

04:40.414 --> 04:42.015
- WELL, THERE MUST BE
AN ALUMNI DATABASE.

04:42.015 --> 04:44.017
- THERE CAN'T BE THAT MANY
CURTS WITH A "C."

04:44.017 --> 04:45.986
- NEXT TIME IT'S MANDATORY
CONFLICT RESOLUTION, SETH.

04:45.986 --> 04:47.521
TRUST ME.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.390
YOU HAVE BETTER THINGS
TO DO.

04:49.390 --> 04:50.924
EVERYTHING OKAY, ROSE?

04:50.924 --> 04:53.627
- THESE ARE SVU DETECTIVES,
MR. LENNOX.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.095
- YOU MUST BE THE HEADMASTER.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.631
- THAT'S WHAT THEY TELL ME.

04:57.631 --> 04:59.433
LET'S TALK IN MY OFFICE.

04:59.433 --> 05:02.803
THIS IS...

05:02.803 --> 05:04.805
DISTURBING.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.007
IF IT'S TRUE.

05:07.007 --> 05:09.777
YOU HEAR ABOUT THIS
AT OTHER SCHOOLS, BUT...

05:09.777 --> 05:11.745
MANOR HILL--
WE'RE VIGILANT.

05:11.745 --> 05:13.747
I'VE BEEN HERE NINE YEARS,

05:13.747 --> 05:15.783
AND I ASSURE YOU, THIS IS
THE FIRST I'M HEARING OF THIS.

05:15.783 --> 05:16.984
- BECAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY

05:16.984 --> 05:19.587
WOULD HAVE REPORTED
ANY ALLEGATIONS.

05:19.587 --> 05:21.054
- OF COURSE.
IT'S THE LAW.

05:21.054 --> 05:22.823
DO YOU KNOW WHEN
THIS WAS WRITTEN?

05:22.823 --> 05:24.825
- WE DON'T BUT, UH,
IT WAS ON LASSITER'S DESK

05:24.825 --> 05:27.628
WHEN HE WAS FOUND DEAD
LAST NIGHT.

05:27.628 --> 05:28.929
- MY GOD.
WHAT HAPPENED?

05:28.929 --> 05:31.064
- WE'RE WAITING
ON THE MEDICAL REPORT.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.467
SO HOW WELL DID YOU KNOW HIM?

05:33.467 --> 05:35.002
- WELL, HE, UH...

05:35.002 --> 05:36.837
HE RETIRED THE SPRING
BEFORE I GOT HERE.

05:36.837 --> 05:38.138
BUT I GATHER
HE WAS MUCH ADMIRED.

05:38.138 --> 05:40.073
- WELL, EVEN SO,

05:40.073 --> 05:42.510
CURT'S MADE SOME SERIOUS
ALLEGATIONS,

05:42.510 --> 05:44.144
AND WE NEED TO FIND HIM.

05:44.144 --> 05:46.747
- WE'LL DO EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO HELP, OBVIOUSLY.

05:46.747 --> 05:49.683
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME, FIN.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU, DAMON.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.885
I FIGURED YOU WAS ON YOUR WAY
STRAIGHT TO THE JOINT.

05:51.885 --> 05:53.554
- COULD'VE BEEN.
- HI.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.022
- HE TOLD ME WHEN WE WERE KIDS

05:55.022 --> 05:57.425
THAT HE'D HAVE A BEAMER
BY THE TIME HE WAS 20.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.560
- I GOT LUCKY.
- AND YOU WERE SMART.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.695
YOU GOT A SCHOLARSHIP
TO MANOR HILL.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.664
- YEAH, WILL, FIN HERE,
HE COULD'VE HAD ONE TOO

06:03.664 --> 06:05.766
IF HE JUST PUT HIS MIND TO IT.
- I DON'T LOOK GOOD

06:05.766 --> 06:07.901
IN BLUE BLAZERS.
- WELL, IT FITS YOU FINE, MAN.

06:07.901 --> 06:10.838
COME ON, PLEASE.

06:10.838 --> 06:13.507
- UM, SO SPEAKING
OF MANOR HILL,

06:13.507 --> 06:15.809
DO YOU KNOW
A HAROLD LASSITER?

06:15.809 --> 06:18.879
- OH, YEAH.
I HAD HIM FOR ENGLISH. WHY?

06:18.879 --> 06:20.914
- HE WAS FOUND DEAD
LAST NIGHT.

06:20.914 --> 06:24.017
WHAT WAS THE WORD ON HIM
BACK AT SCHOOL?

06:24.017 --> 06:26.587
- HE WAS A GOOD TEACHER.

06:26.587 --> 06:30.891
- WE'RE NOT...HERE
TO TALK ABOUT HIS TEACHING.

06:32.593 --> 06:34.562
- I HEARD SOME THINGS.

06:34.562 --> 06:37.865
- GO ON.
- HE GOT A LITTLE TOUCHY-FEELY.

06:37.865 --> 06:41.168
HUGS, WHATNOT,
AFTER DRAMA REHEARSALS.

06:41.168 --> 06:42.670
- HE EVER HUG YOU?

06:42.670 --> 06:45.806
- HE TRIED TO.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.676
I MUST HAVE LOOKED LIKE
A TARGET.

06:48.676 --> 06:53.447
SCHOLARSHIP KID.
JUST HAPPY TO BE THERE.

06:53.447 --> 06:55.415
NOT GONNA ROCK
ANY BOATS, YOU KNOW?

06:57.084 --> 07:00.220
- WHAT'D HE DO?

07:00.220 --> 07:02.790
- HE GAVE ME
A SHOULDER MASSAGE

07:02.790 --> 07:04.758
AND, UH, SAID IT WAS
TO LOOSEN ME UP.

07:04.758 --> 07:06.894
IT DIDN'T.

07:06.894 --> 07:09.763
SO THEN HE TRIED RUBBING ME
SOMEWHERE ELSE.

07:09.763 --> 07:12.866
AND I TOLD HIM THAT IF HE
EVER DID THAT AGAIN,

07:12.866 --> 07:15.168
I'D BREAK HIS ARM.

07:15.168 --> 07:16.670
- DID YOU REPORT IT?

07:16.670 --> 07:19.773
- NO. HE WAS RIGHT
ABOUT ONE THING.

07:19.773 --> 07:22.042
I WASN'T GONNA ROCK
ANY BOATS.

07:22.042 --> 07:25.045
- DO YOU REMEMBER
A STUDENT NAMED CURT?

07:25.045 --> 07:27.147
- CURT. NO, NOT IN MY CLASS.

07:27.147 --> 07:29.917
- WE'RE TRYING
TO TRACK HIM DOWN.

07:29.917 --> 07:34.054
AS AN ALUM, YOU HAVE ACCESS
TO THE WEBSITE.

07:34.054 --> 07:37.925
- MANOR HILL SAVED MY LIFE.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.893
I MET PEOPLE
WHO ARE STILL MY GOOD FRIENDS,

07:39.893 --> 07:41.895
GOT ME TO THE IVY LEAGUE.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.631
I'M ON THE BOARD.

07:43.631 --> 07:47.535
- YEAH, BUT THIS CURT...

07:47.535 --> 07:50.704
LASSITER...HURT HIM.

07:50.704 --> 07:53.006
OKAY?

07:53.006 --> 07:55.509
AND MAYBE OTHERS TOO.

07:55.509 --> 07:57.878
- THIS WOULD BE BETWEEN
JUST YOU AND US, DAMON.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.147
SCHOOL
DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW.

08:03.551 --> 08:05.753
- I'VE GOT A LIST.

08:05.753 --> 08:08.589
EVERY ALUM
GOING BACK TO 1886.

08:08.589 --> 08:10.791
THEIR SPORTS TEAMS,
THEIR CLUBS.

08:10.791 --> 08:15.829
CURT--
START WITH THE DRAMA CLUB.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.668
- YEAH, THAT WAS ME.
ABOUT 30 POUNDS AGO.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.170
MORE HAIR.
- AND YOUR DRAMA TEACHER

08:23.170 --> 08:25.138
HAROLD LASSITER?
- WE DID BILLY BUD.

08:25.138 --> 08:27.708
- "LOST FOREVER
ON THE ENDLESS SEA."

08:27.708 --> 08:29.610
THAT'S IN THE LIBRETTO,
RIGHT?

08:29.610 --> 08:32.946
- WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?
- DID YOU WRITE THIS, CURT?

08:32.946 --> 08:34.848
- A WHILE AGO.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.183
WHAT, DID LASSITER FILE
A COMPLAINT?

08:36.183 --> 08:37.918
HE'S FULL OF CRAP.
I NEVER CALLED HIM.

08:37.918 --> 08:39.687
I NEVER WENT NEAR HIM.
- SLOW DOWN, CURT.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.889
BUT YOU DID WRITE IT.

08:41.889 --> 08:44.825
- MY NEW THERAPIST
THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP.

08:44.825 --> 08:46.827
TO GET SOME OF
THE FEELINGS OUT.

08:46.827 --> 08:50.130
YOU LIE TO YOURSELF,
SUPPRESS IT FOR SO LONG

08:50.130 --> 08:53.601
IT JUST FEEDS THE DRAGON.

08:53.601 --> 08:54.935
WHAT, DID HE TRY
AND DENY IT?

08:54.935 --> 08:57.270
- CAN YOU TELL US
WHERE YOU WERE LAST NIGHT?

08:57.270 --> 08:59.740
- I WAS WORKING MY PROGRAM,
MY SURVIVORS OF ABUSE GROUP.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.274
WHY?
- BECAUSE HAROLD LASSITER

09:01.274 --> 09:03.210
WAS FOUND DEAD LAST NIGHT.

09:03.210 --> 09:04.778
- WHAT?

09:04.778 --> 09:06.113
- WITH YOUR LETTER NEXT TO HIM.

09:06.113 --> 09:08.682
- MY GOD, WHAT HAPPENED?
- WE'RE NOT SURE.

09:08.682 --> 09:11.852
WE'RE WAITING FOR THE MEDICAL
EXAMINER'S REPORT.

09:11.852 --> 09:15.088
- I DIDN'T KILL HIM!

09:15.088 --> 09:19.126
I-I THOUGHT ABOUT
KILLING HIM.

09:19.126 --> 09:21.261
WHAT HE DID TO ME--
I CAN'T HOLD ON TO A GIRLFRIEND.

09:21.261 --> 09:22.996
I GOT INTO DRUGS.

09:22.996 --> 09:27.635
BE-BEFORE LASSITER,
I WANTED TO SING AT THE MET.

09:27.635 --> 09:30.037
NOW I WORK AT A DOG HOTEL.
- AN ABUSER LIKE LASSITER,

09:30.037 --> 09:32.640
THEY DON'T JUST DO THIS ONCE.

09:32.640 --> 09:36.143
DO YOU KNOW OF ANYONE ELSE
THAT HE MAY HAVE TARGETED?

09:36.143 --> 09:37.978
- LATELY I'VE BEEN TALKING
TO SOME OF MY FORMER CLASSMATES

09:37.978 --> 09:39.747
AT MANOR HILL.

09:39.747 --> 09:41.815
IT'S, UH, PRETTY HEAVY.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.784
- DID YOU OR ANY OF YOUR
CLASSMATES

09:43.784 --> 09:46.286
EVER FILE A POLICE REPORT?
- NO!

09:46.286 --> 09:47.988
- WE NEED TO GET THE TRUTH.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.758
IF LASSITER WAS
A CAREER PEDOPHILE,

09:50.758 --> 09:52.760
EVEN IF HE'S DEAD...

09:52.760 --> 09:55.763
KEEPING THE DRAGON BURIED--

09:55.763 --> 09:58.398
THAT'S JUST GONNA HURT
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

09:58.398 --> 10:01.802
- THE PEOPLE I'M TALKING TO--
THEY ARE NOT IN RECOVERY.

10:01.802 --> 10:03.170
THEY ARE STRUGGLING!

10:03.170 --> 10:04.805
- IF WE COULD TALK TO THEM,

10:04.805 --> 10:07.675
WE MIGHT JUST GET TO
THE TRUTH.

10:12.145 --> 10:14.281
- I DON'T GET IT.
I THOUGHT THIS WAS

10:14.281 --> 10:16.850
SOME KIND OF MEMORIAL?
WHO INVITED DETECTIVES?

10:16.850 --> 10:18.919
- GUYS, HERE'S THE DEAL.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.788
WHAT WE SAY HERE STAYS HERE.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.690
- WHAT WE SAY ABOUT WHAT?
- I'M NOT BROKEN UP

10:22.690 --> 10:24.091
THAT HE DIED, OKAY?

10:24.091 --> 10:26.827
BUT NONE OF US HERE
HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.796
- WE'RE HERE TO INVESTIGATE
LASSITER'S DEATH

10:28.796 --> 10:30.297
AND HIS LIFE.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.766
- RIGHT. WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO,
PROSECUTE A DEAD MAN?

10:32.766 --> 10:35.969
- NO. BUT WE NEED TO
FIND OUT WHAT HE DID.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.839
WHO MIGHT HAVE KNOWN ABOUT IT,
WHO FAILED TO ACT ON IT.

10:38.839 --> 10:40.173
- GUYS, WE HAVE
NOTHING TO HIDE.

10:40.173 --> 10:42.409
WE ARE NOT THE ONES
WHO DID ANYTHING WRONG.

10:45.813 --> 10:48.448
- GENTLEMEN, IF I MAY...

10:48.448 --> 10:51.351
I'VE BEEN DOING THIS
FOR A LONG TIME,

10:51.351 --> 10:53.453
AND I UNDERSTAND THE SHAME

10:53.453 --> 10:56.189
AND THE STIGMA.

10:56.189 --> 11:00.293
BUT KEEPING
THE ABUSE SECRET...

11:00.293 --> 11:02.195
DOESN'T MAKE IT GO AWAY.

11:05.032 --> 11:07.300
- SHE'S RIGHT.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.470
I KIND OF PUT IT AWAY
ALL THESE YEARS AND, UH,

11:10.470 --> 11:13.774
IT ALL JUST CAME FLOODING BACK
WHEN I HEARD THAT HE DIED.

11:13.774 --> 11:16.076
HE, UH, STARTED WITH...

11:16.076 --> 11:18.311
WHAT DID WE, UH,
WHAT DID WE CALL IT?

11:18.311 --> 11:20.413
- THE LASSITER LASSO.

11:20.413 --> 11:22.149
HE'D ROPE HIS ARM AROUND YOU,

11:22.149 --> 11:25.853
PULL YOU IN, AND POKE YOU
UNDER THE RIBS.

11:25.853 --> 11:28.088
YOU REMEMBER, RIGHT, NATHAN?

11:28.088 --> 11:31.224
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

11:32.926 --> 11:35.829
LOOK, YOU GUYS WANNA BLAME
EVERYTHING THAT'S WRONG

11:35.829 --> 11:36.797
WITH YOUR LIVES
ON SOMEONE TICKLING YOU--

11:36.797 --> 11:38.732
[scoffs]

11:38.732 --> 11:39.900
PEACE OUT.

11:41.334 --> 11:43.370
[door opens and slams shut]

11:43.370 --> 11:44.872
- LASSO?

11:44.872 --> 11:46.774
- IT WAS A TEST.

11:46.774 --> 11:48.375
IF YOU LAUGHED,
DIDN'T BACK OFF,

11:48.375 --> 11:50.243
THE NEXT STEP
WAS THE MASSAGE.

11:50.243 --> 11:52.780
- HE'D SAY, "YOUNG BOYS
SHOULDN'T CARRY TENSION

11:52.780 --> 11:55.382
IN THEIR SHOULDERS.
YOU'LL STOOP WHEN YOU'RE OLDER."

11:55.382 --> 11:57.217
[cell phone rings]
- AND IF YOU WENT WITH THAT,

11:57.217 --> 11:59.820
THEN HE WOULD SAY THERE WAS
ANOTHER PART THAT WAS TENSE

11:59.820 --> 12:01.822
THAT NEEDED MASSAGING.

12:01.822 --> 12:03.891
- LASSITER WAS A COWARD.
HE'D BACK OFF.

12:03.891 --> 12:06.894
STREPEK?
TEN TIMES WORSE.

12:06.894 --> 12:09.396
- STREPEK.
ANOTHER TEACHER?

12:09.396 --> 12:10.931
- HE RAPED ME.

12:10.931 --> 12:13.967
- I STEERED CLEAR
OF STREPEK, BUT...

12:13.967 --> 12:16.904
MORTON.
HE CAUGHT ME OFF GUARD.

12:16.904 --> 12:19.239
HE WAITED UNTIL I WAS DRUNK
AT THE JUNIOR PROM,

12:19.239 --> 12:21.241
AND THEN HE OFFERED
TO DRIVE ME HOME.

12:21.241 --> 12:23.911
- ARE THESE TEACHERS
STILL AT THE SCHOOL?

12:23.911 --> 12:27.547
- STREPEK'S DEAD,
AND I WISH I'D KILLED HIM.

12:27.547 --> 12:31.051
THE SON OF A BITCH
GAVE ME GONORRHEA TOO.

12:31.051 --> 12:33.486
- LIV.
- EXCUSE ME.

12:37.791 --> 12:39.793
- THE M.E.
JUST FINALIZED THE CASE,

12:39.793 --> 12:42.262
AND LASSITER WAS A SUICIDE.

12:42.262 --> 12:44.264
- WHAT ABOUT MERCER?
IN THE LOCKER ROOM?

12:44.264 --> 12:47.134
HE HIT ON THE WHOLE
SWIM TEAM.

12:47.134 --> 12:50.270
- WE DON'T HAVE TO STAY...

12:50.270 --> 12:52.305
- MIKE.

12:52.305 --> 12:54.141
JONATHAN, KEN.

12:54.141 --> 12:55.843
WELCOME.

12:55.843 --> 12:58.812
- YEAH.

12:58.812 --> 13:01.448
WE DO.

13:06.987 --> 13:08.889
- LASSITER WASN'T
AN ISOLATED PREDATOR.

13:08.889 --> 13:10.490
WE'RE LOOKING AT THREE DECADES
OF SEXUAL ABUSE,

13:10.490 --> 13:12.359
A DOZEN VICTIMS AND COUNTING.

13:12.359 --> 13:15.195
- AT LEAST FOUR OF THE TEACHERS
WERE SERIAL ABUSERS

13:15.195 --> 13:17.264
ALL UNDER
THE PREVIOUS HEADMASTER.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.832
- TERRIFIC GRAPHIC WORK.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.000
ANY OF THIS HAPPEN
IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.268
- NO.
- ARE ANY OF THE VICTIMS

13:21.268 --> 13:23.036
UNDER 23 NOW?
- NO, BUT WE'VE GOT--

13:23.036 --> 13:24.437
- OKAY, DIFFERENT STATES
DO HAVE DIFFERENT STATUTES.

13:24.437 --> 13:27.307
DID ANY OF THIS TAKE PLACE
ON A FIELD TRIP

13:27.307 --> 13:29.877
OR A SPORTS TEAM ROAD TRIP?

13:29.877 --> 13:31.211
CONNECTICUT, MASSACHUSETTS.
- YOU EVER THINK ABOUT

13:31.211 --> 13:33.113
GOING OFF CAFFEINE?
- THAT'D BE A NO.

13:33.113 --> 13:35.015
SO WHY ARE YOU HERE AGAIN?
- IF YOU'D LET US

13:35.015 --> 13:36.149
GET A WORD IN, COUNSELOR...

13:38.418 --> 13:40.053
- THANK YOU.

13:40.053 --> 13:42.255
THE SYSTEMIC ABUSE.
IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY

13:42.255 --> 13:45.058
THAT NO ONE IN THE SCHOOL'S
ADMINISTRATION KNEW ABOUT IT.

13:45.058 --> 13:46.894
- HIGHLY UNLIKELY?

13:46.894 --> 13:49.096
THAT'S A LONG WAY FROM
BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT.

13:49.096 --> 13:50.397
HAVE YOU BEEN TO THE SCHOOL?

13:50.397 --> 13:52.332
- OBVIOUSLY THEY WERE
LESS THAN FORTHCOMING.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.167
- WE HAD TO GET NAMES AND
YEARBOOKS FROM A FRIEND OF FIN'S

13:54.167 --> 13:56.069
WHO WENT THERE ON SCHOLARSHIP.
HE'S NOW ON THE BOARD.

13:56.069 --> 14:00.040
- OKAY, BACK UP.
LASSITER HANGED HIMSELF.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.542
ARE ANY OF THE OTHERS
STILL WORKING?

14:02.542 --> 14:05.245
- THE PREVIOUS HEADMASTER
AND STREPEK--

14:05.245 --> 14:07.080
THEY'RE BOTH DECEASED.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.116
MERCER, THE SWIM COACH,
HE'S IN THAILAND.

14:09.116 --> 14:10.217
AT LEAST, THAT'S WHERE HIS
SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS

14:10.217 --> 14:11.952
ARE BEING SENT.

14:11.952 --> 14:13.921
BUT MORTON HERE...

14:13.921 --> 14:16.089
HE DID TEACH UNTIL
A FEW YEARS AGO.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.490
- SO IT IS POSSIBLE
THAT HIS ABUSE

14:17.490 --> 14:19.960
FALLS WITHIN THE STATUTE.

14:19.960 --> 14:22.329
- IF HE DID ABUSE STUDENTS,
HE WON'T ADMIT IT.

14:22.329 --> 14:24.097
TELL HIM YOU ALREADY KNOW.

14:24.097 --> 14:26.233
HE MIGHT TRY TO SAVE HIMSELF
BY TURNING ON MANOR HILL.

14:26.233 --> 14:29.502
SCHOOLS LIKE THIS,
THERE'S AN INSULARITY,

14:29.502 --> 14:32.372
A CULTURE OF SECRECY
AND SELF-PRESERVATION.

14:32.372 --> 14:35.075
IF YOU WANT THOSE
FIELD STONE WALLS TO TUMBLE,

14:35.075 --> 14:38.145
YOU'RE GONNA NEED
HEAVY ARTILLERY.

14:38.145 --> 14:40.080
[train whistle blows]

14:40.080 --> 14:42.415
- AH, YES,
THE BOYS OF SUMMER.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.117
[chuckles]
THERE WERE SO MANY OF THEM.

14:44.117 --> 14:46.086
IT'S HARD TO REMEMBER.

14:46.086 --> 14:49.089
- MR. MORTON, YOU ONLY STOPPED
TEACHING SIX YEARS AGO.

14:49.089 --> 14:51.291
CAN YOU REMEMBER
ANY OF THESE STUDENTS?

14:51.291 --> 14:53.126
- WELL, WHICH YEAR?

14:53.126 --> 14:56.163
- ELI FROMSON,
CLASS OF '92.

14:56.163 --> 15:00.067
- HE SAID YOU INVITED HIM
OVER YOUR HOUSE FOR DRINKS.

15:00.067 --> 15:01.601
- ISN'T THAT LOVELY?

15:01.601 --> 15:03.971
I LIKE TO COME DOWN HERE
AND BUILD THINGS.

15:03.971 --> 15:07.107
PLAY STATIONMASTER.
IT HELPS ME FORGET.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.276
- WHAT DO YOU WANT TO FORGET,
MR. MORTON?

15:09.276 --> 15:11.078
WHAT HAPPENED WITH ELI?

15:11.078 --> 15:13.580
- ELI WAS ONE OF MY STARS...

15:13.580 --> 15:17.117
ALONG WITH DAVID AND CHARLIE.

15:17.117 --> 15:20.053
- THREE BOYS?
- OH, MORE THAN THAT.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.588
CAMBRIDGE WAS WONDERFUL--

15:21.588 --> 15:24.291
- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
MANOR HILL.

15:24.291 --> 15:28.595
- IS THIS...
BEFORE OR AFTER CHOSIN?

15:28.595 --> 15:30.530
- CHOSIN?
- MM.

15:30.530 --> 15:33.533
- YOU TALKING ABOUT
THE KOREAN WAR?

15:33.533 --> 15:37.037
- I THOUGHT HE DIED THERE,
TERRENCE.

15:37.037 --> 15:39.439
BUT WE HELD OUR POSITION.

15:39.439 --> 15:42.409
[bell ringing]

15:44.111 --> 15:47.047
[quietly]
TIME FOR TEA.

15:47.047 --> 15:49.983
- JUST COME THIS WAY,
MR. TOMPKINS.

15:49.983 --> 15:51.518
THANK YOU FOR COMING IN.

15:51.518 --> 15:54.554
JUST, UH, HAVE A SEAT
RIGHT IN HERE.

15:54.554 --> 15:56.423
I'LL BE RIGHT WITH YOU.

15:58.091 --> 15:59.492
- WHO'S THAT?

15:59.492 --> 16:03.196
- FORMER TEACHER.
AT MANOR HILL.

16:03.196 --> 16:05.232
HE WANTS TO TALK.

16:05.232 --> 16:07.234
HE'S A WALTER TOMPKINS.

16:07.234 --> 16:10.070
- NONE OF THE VICTIMS
MENTION THAT NAME.

16:10.070 --> 16:12.172
- YOU SAID
YOU TAUGHT AT MANOR HILL?

16:12.172 --> 16:14.007
- 40 YEARS.

16:14.007 --> 16:17.544
I'M STILL IN TOUCH
WITH MANY OF MY FORMER STUDENTS.

16:17.544 --> 16:22.082
I'VE HEARD THAT YOU'RE
INVESTIGATING SOME EVENTS.

16:22.082 --> 16:25.485
- YES.
ALLEGATIONS OF SEXUAL ABUSE

16:25.485 --> 16:27.587
OF STUDENTS BY TEACHERS.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.089
- SEXUAL ABUSE--

16:29.089 --> 16:32.359
TWO WORDS THAT SHOULD
NEVER GO TOGETHER.

16:32.359 --> 16:36.596
HAS ANYONE NAMED ME?

16:36.596 --> 16:39.066
- SHOULD THEY HAVE?

16:39.066 --> 16:42.569
- I HAD SEX WITH STUDENTS.

16:42.569 --> 16:45.572
OLDER STUDENTS.
TWO.

16:45.572 --> 16:48.208
AND I WAS PHYSICALLY
AFFECTIONATE WITH A THIRD.

16:54.114 --> 16:55.815
- OKAY.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.284
AND WHEN WAS THIS?

16:57.284 --> 17:00.653
- IN THE '70s, EARLY '80s.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.689
A DIFFERENT TIME.

17:02.689 --> 17:04.724
I KNOW YOU WON'T UNDERSTAND,

17:04.724 --> 17:07.460
BUT I DON'T MEAN THIS
AS A CONFESSION

17:07.460 --> 17:10.130
AS IF WE DID SOMETHING WRONG.

17:10.130 --> 17:12.632
OUR RELATIONSHIPS WERE...

17:12.632 --> 17:15.102
WARM, SPONTANEOUS,

17:15.102 --> 17:16.636
CARING.

17:16.636 --> 17:18.338
- AND HOW OLD WERE THESE
STUDENTS?

17:18.338 --> 17:21.074
- 17, 18.

17:21.074 --> 17:23.343
- WELL, THAT'S CONVENIENT,
ISN'T IT?

17:23.343 --> 17:25.145
YOU BREACH THEIR TRUST,

17:25.145 --> 17:28.148
BUT YOU KNOW THAT THERE'S
NOTHING WE CAN DO ABOUT IT NOW.

17:28.148 --> 17:31.151
- I'M NOT HERE TO AVOID
RESPONSIBILITY.

17:31.151 --> 17:32.785
- WHY ARE YOU HERE,
MR. TOMPKINS?

17:32.785 --> 17:37.357
- MY ACTIONS MAY HAVE HAD
CONSEQUENCES I DIDN'T FORESEE.

17:37.357 --> 17:41.661
IF ANY OF THEM FEEL
THAT I HARMED THEM...

17:41.661 --> 17:43.863
IF I DID HARM THEM,

17:43.863 --> 17:47.700
PERHAPS IT WOULD BE HELP
FOR THEM TO CONFRONT ME

17:47.700 --> 17:50.803
OR THROUGH YOU
TO SHARE THEIR ANGER.

17:50.803 --> 17:53.406
- DID ANYBODY
AT MANOR HILL KNOW

17:53.406 --> 17:55.575
THAT YOU WERE HAVING SEX
WITH STUDENTS?

17:55.575 --> 17:58.478
- NO. OUR RELATIONSHIPS
WERE PRIVATE.

17:58.478 --> 18:00.747
NO ONE WAS OUT
IN THOSE DAYS.

18:00.747 --> 18:03.250
IT WOULD HAVE STIGMATIZED
THE YOUNGER MEN.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.586
ONLY NOW ARE THEY COMING
FORWARD.

18:06.586 --> 18:10.557
SOME OF MY STUDENTS
EMAILED ME JUST A FEW DAYS AGO

18:10.557 --> 18:13.360
TO TELL ME ABOUT
COERCIVE RELATIONSHIPS.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.861
I'M HORRIFIED.

18:14.861 --> 18:17.497
- WAIT. SO YOU DIDN'T KNOW
ABOUT OTHER TEACHERS?

18:17.497 --> 18:19.666
LASSITER, MORTON,

18:19.666 --> 18:21.868
STREPEK, MERCER.
- NO, NO, NO.

18:21.868 --> 18:25.538
I'VE BEEN BEATING MYSELF UP
THAT STUDENTS WERE ABUSED

18:25.538 --> 18:29.276
AND I FAILED TO SEE IT,
I FAILED TO HELP THEM.

18:30.877 --> 18:33.580
- THANK YOU,
MR. TOMPKINS.

18:33.580 --> 18:36.349
- MR. TOMPKINS?
WHY ARE YOU GUYS TALKING TO HIM?

18:36.349 --> 18:38.185
HE'S EVERYONE'S
FAVORITE TEACHER.

18:38.185 --> 18:40.553
- BECAUSE HE CAME IN
AND CONFESSED.

18:40.553 --> 18:42.722
HE HAD SEX WITH STUDENTS.

18:42.722 --> 18:44.324
- I'VE TALKED TO 25 VICTIMS.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.393
NO ONE HAD A BAD WORD
TO SAY ABOUT HIM.

18:46.393 --> 18:49.296
- WELL, HE FEELS
THAT THE SCHOOL MAY HAVE KNOWN.

18:49.296 --> 18:51.898
- OF COURSE THEY KNEW.
THEY'RE STILL COVERING IT UP.

18:51.898 --> 18:54.201
- TOMPKINS HAD NO PROOF,
AND AS OF NOW, NEITHER DO WE.

18:54.201 --> 18:56.436
- SO YOU'RE JUST GONNA
DROP THIS CASE?

18:56.436 --> 18:58.871
- THERE IS NO CASE.
LASSITER AND STREPEK ARE DEAD.

18:58.871 --> 19:00.273
MERCER'S HALFWAY
AROUND THE WORLD,

19:00.273 --> 19:02.175
AND MORTON IS SENILE.

19:02.175 --> 19:04.211
- I'M GETTING CALLS AND EMAILS
FROM MORE SURVIVORS.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.813
PEOPLE WHO HAVE REPRESSED
ALL OF THIS.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.948
MOST OF US NEVER
TALKED TO EACH OTHER BEFORE.

19:08.948 --> 19:11.184
THIS IS MORE WIDESPREAD
THAN ANY OF US KNEW.

19:11.184 --> 19:13.253
- IT'S AN OUTRAGE.
I AGREE.

19:13.253 --> 19:15.655
BUT THE ONLY POSSIBLE CASE
IS AGAINST THE SCHOOL,

19:15.655 --> 19:17.957
IF IT KNEW ABOUT THE ABUSE
AND COVERED IT UP.

19:17.957 --> 19:19.959
- THEY KNEW.

19:19.959 --> 19:21.761
MY DAD TOLD 'EM.

19:21.761 --> 19:25.932
- WHAT?
- AFTER I GOT GONORRHEA,

19:25.932 --> 19:28.968
MY DAD BECAME SUSPICIOUS
OF STREPEK.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.437
I TOLD HIM NOTHING HAPPENED,

19:30.437 --> 19:31.571
BUT HE WENT STRAIGHT
TO THE SCHOOL.

19:31.571 --> 19:32.805
HE CONFRONTED THE HEADMASTER.

19:32.805 --> 19:35.408
- THIS HEADMASTER--HE DECEASED?
- YEAH.

19:35.408 --> 19:37.244
- CAN YOUR FATHER
CONFIRM THIS MEETING?

19:37.244 --> 19:39.912
- HE'S GONE TOO.

19:39.912 --> 19:42.249
I'LL TESTIFY.

19:42.249 --> 19:44.884
- IF IT COMES TO THAT.
- THE SCHOOL WON'T LET IT.

19:44.884 --> 19:46.953
I SENT THE BOARD
AN EMAIL PETITION.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.621
I GOT A CALL BACK
FROM THEIR LAWYER

19:48.621 --> 19:50.323
THREATENING TO SUE ME
FOR DEFAMATION.

19:50.323 --> 19:51.791
- THAT'S A LEGAL MANEUVER.

19:51.791 --> 19:52.925
IT DOESN'T RISE
TO THE LEVEL OF A CRIME.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.794
- I DON'T CARE ABOUT
CHARGES.

19:54.794 --> 19:56.729
I MEAN, WOULD IT KILL THEM

19:56.729 --> 19:59.799
TO JUST ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT SOMETHING BAD HAPPENED?

19:59.799 --> 20:01.701
- HOW 'BOUT AN APOLOGY?

20:04.871 --> 20:06.839
- HE'S RIGHT.

20:06.839 --> 20:10.677
AN APOLOGY CAN MAKE A HUGE
DIFFERENCE IN GETTING CLOSURE.

20:10.677 --> 20:12.912
- AND IT CAN ALSO BE PERCEIVED
AS AN ADMISSION OF GUILT.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.981
WHICH LEAVES THE SCHOOL OPEN
TO LIABILITY CLAIMS.

20:14.981 --> 20:17.250
THEY'D RATHER CLOSE RANKS.

20:17.250 --> 20:19.686
- SO ABUSE MEANS NEVER HAVING
TO SAY YOU'RE SORRY.

20:19.686 --> 20:21.788
- WE HAVE TO PUSH BACK.

20:21.788 --> 20:24.524
A D.A. ASKING TO MEET
WITH THE HEADMASTER?

20:24.524 --> 20:26.959
THAT'S HEAVY ARTILLERY.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.499
- I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF INVITING
BRETT FORRESTER,

20:32.499 --> 20:34.401
OUR BOARD CHAIR.

20:34.401 --> 20:37.770
- AND YOUR ATTORNEY?
LONG TIME NO SEE, MS. CALHOUN.

20:37.770 --> 20:39.939
I'M GLAD MANOR HILL'S
TAKING THESE CHARGES SERIOUSLY.

20:39.939 --> 20:41.308
- LIKE HELL WE ARE.

20:41.308 --> 20:43.042
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHY WE'RE MEETING.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.711
- IT NEVER HURTS
TO LISTEN, BRETT.

20:44.711 --> 20:46.646
- WELL, WE'VE SPOKEN
WITH TWO DOZEN

20:46.646 --> 20:48.381
MANOR HILL ALUMNI

20:48.381 --> 20:50.317
WHO WERE ABUSED WHILE THEY
WERE STUDENTS HERE.

20:50.317 --> 20:52.051
- ALLEGED THEY WERE ABUSED.

20:52.051 --> 20:55.021
AND THEY WAITED WHAT--
20, 30 YEARS TO COME FORWARD?

20:55.021 --> 20:56.489
- I'M SURE THAT YOU KNOW,

20:56.489 --> 20:58.591
GIVEN THE STIGMA
OF THIS KIND OF ABUSE,

20:58.591 --> 21:00.960
THAT THE TIME DELAY
IS NOT UNUSUAL.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.063
- IT'S ALSO UNVERIFIABLE
AND SUBJECT TO MANIPULATION,

21:04.063 --> 21:07.033
WHICH IS WHY THE STATUTE OF
LIMITATIONS WAS PUT INTO EFFECT.

21:07.033 --> 21:08.067
- THAT DOESN'T APPLY
IF THE SCHOOL

21:08.067 --> 21:09.869
FAILED TO REPORT THE ABUSE

21:09.869 --> 21:12.672
AND CONTINUES TO COVER UP
ITS FAILURE TO REPORT.

21:12.672 --> 21:14.341
- IF YOU HAD ANY EVIDENCE
OF THAT,

21:14.341 --> 21:15.808
YOU WOULDN'T BE HERE
ON THIS FISHING EXPEDITION.

21:15.808 --> 21:18.545
OR IS THERE SOMETHING SPECIFIC
YOU WANTED?

21:18.545 --> 21:20.880
- UH, YES, FOR STARTERS,

21:20.880 --> 21:22.982
THE VICTIMS WOULD LIKE
AN APOLOGY.

21:22.982 --> 21:24.917
- EXCUSE ME?

21:24.917 --> 21:26.919
- IT WOULD HELP THEIR HEALING

21:26.919 --> 21:29.822
TO HEAR AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT
OF WRONGDOING.

21:29.822 --> 21:32.024
- IT WOULD ALSO HELP THEM
SUE MANOR HILL.

21:32.024 --> 21:35.328
- I AM SORRY FOR THEIR PAIN.

21:35.328 --> 21:36.963
BUT YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND

21:36.963 --> 21:40.667
THE SCHOOL'S REPUTATION
AND MISSION ARE AT STAKE.

21:40.667 --> 21:42.835
- YOU'RE WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR REPUTATION?

21:42.835 --> 21:43.936
TALK TO ANYONE IN P.R.

21:43.936 --> 21:45.838
YOU WANT TO GET IN FRONT
OF THIS THING

21:45.838 --> 21:47.340
BEFORE IT EXPLODES IN YOUR FACE.
- I'VE HEARD ENOUGH.

21:47.340 --> 21:50.076
- MY GRANDFATHER, MY FATHER,
MYSELF, MY SON

21:50.076 --> 21:52.679
ALL GRADUATED FROM MANOR HILL.

21:52.679 --> 21:54.914
FOUR GENERATIONS.
WE CREATED LEADERS

21:54.914 --> 21:57.083
IN ART, SCIENCE, BUSINESS,
POLITICS.

21:57.083 --> 21:59.986
- IT ALSO CREATED VICTIMS

21:59.986 --> 22:03.055
WHO SUFFER WITH
FAILED RELATIONSHIPS,

22:03.055 --> 22:05.392
UNEMPLOYMENT, SUBSTANCE ABUSE.

22:05.392 --> 22:06.926
I COULD GO ON.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.561
- THEY DRINK TOO MUCH
AND GET DIVORCED?

22:08.561 --> 22:10.897
A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE
DISAPPOINTING LIVES.

22:10.897 --> 22:13.966
THESE FAILURES

22:13.966 --> 22:15.968
ARE JUST TRYING TO EXCUSE
THEIR OWN BEHAVIOR.

22:15.968 --> 22:18.405
- OKAY, WE'RE ONLY ASKING
MANOR HILL

22:18.405 --> 22:21.408
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

22:21.408 --> 22:23.476
- THE RIGHT THING IS TO
PROTECT THIS INSTITUTION.

22:23.476 --> 22:25.412
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE US,
WE HAVE TO PREPARE

22:25.412 --> 22:28.515
FOR OUR CAPITAL CAMPAIGN
RECEPTION TONIGHT.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.686
- NICE CAMPUS.

22:33.686 --> 22:34.787
AS A KID GROWING UP
IN THE SOUTH BRONX

22:34.787 --> 22:36.055
GOING TO CATHOLIC SCHOOL,

22:36.055 --> 22:37.890
I WOULD'VE GIVEN ANYTHING
TO GO HERE.

22:37.890 --> 22:39.926
- SMART GUY LIKE YOU
COULDN'T GET A SCHOLARSHIP?

22:39.926 --> 22:41.561
- ONLY KIDS THEY TOOK
FROM MY NEIGHBORHOOD

22:41.561 --> 22:43.396
WERE THE ATHLETES.

22:43.396 --> 22:45.732
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
THIS WAS A WASTE OF TIME.

22:45.732 --> 22:48.501
I'M A PROSECUTOR,
NOT A HEALER.

22:48.501 --> 22:50.837
- ALL DUE RESPECT,
AS A PROSECUTOR

22:50.837 --> 22:53.406
DON'T YOU WANT TO
MAKE A CASE?

22:53.406 --> 22:55.475
I KNOW SOMETHING CRIMINAL
WENT ON HERE.

22:55.475 --> 22:56.876
[keys jangle]

22:56.876 --> 23:01.481
SO DO YOU.

23:01.481 --> 23:03.115
[engine starts]

23:08.020 --> 23:09.756
- OKAY.

23:09.756 --> 23:11.558
THEIR LAWYER THINKS
WE'RE ON A FISHING EXPEDITION?

23:11.558 --> 23:13.460
LET'S GO FISHING.

23:13.460 --> 23:15.194
- CURT IS TRYING TO PROVE
THAT A COMPLAINT

23:15.194 --> 23:18.064
WAS INDEED MADE TO THE SCHOOL.

23:18.064 --> 23:20.800
- VINCENT GAVE US ACCESS
TO HIS MEDICAL RECORDS.

23:20.800 --> 23:23.035
HE DID HAVE AN STD
AS A STUDENT,

23:23.035 --> 23:24.571
AND HE'S READY TO TESTIFY.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.038
- WHAT'S ON OUR SIDE--

23:26.038 --> 23:27.807
A WAY AROUND THE STATUTE
OF LIMITATIONS.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.543
IF THE SCHOOL RECEIVED
AN ALLEGATION AND DIDN'T REPORT

23:30.543 --> 23:33.746
AND HAS CONTINUED EFFORTS TO
BLOCK DISCOVERY OF THE ABUSE.

23:33.746 --> 23:35.948
- WHAT'S AGAINST US--
ALL THE WITNESSES

23:35.948 --> 23:38.084
TO THE REPORT WE HEARD ABOUT
ARE DEAD--

23:38.084 --> 23:40.152
VINCENT'S FATHER,
THE OLD HEADMASTER, STREPEK.

23:40.152 --> 23:42.822
- I MAY HAVE ANOTHER WAY IN.

23:42.822 --> 23:44.891
I'M GOING OVER
THE ALUMNI NEWS LETTERS.

23:44.891 --> 23:47.527
MANOR HILL GAVE STREPEK
A GOING-AWAY PARTY

23:47.527 --> 23:48.595
NINE YEARS AGO.

23:48.595 --> 23:50.730
HE WASN'T EVEN 60.

23:50.730 --> 23:52.799
- PRETTY YOUNG FOR THAT SCHOOL.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.634
MAYBE THEY FORCED HIM
INTO EARLY RETIREMENT

23:54.634 --> 23:56.603
BECAUSE THEY KNEW?

23:56.603 --> 23:58.805
- WELL, IF THEY KNEW,
THEY KEPT IT TO THEMSELVES.

23:58.805 --> 24:00.607
LOOK AT THIS.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.509
TWO MONTHS LATER,

24:02.509 --> 24:04.477
THEY'VE GOT NO PROBLEM
CONGRATULATING MR. STREPEK

24:04.477 --> 24:07.580
AT HIS HIRE AT A CHARTER SCHOOL
IN HARLEM.

24:07.580 --> 24:08.881
- WE'RE GETTING CLOSER.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.883
TALK TO THAT CHARTER SCHOOL.

24:10.883 --> 24:13.586
GIVE ME SOMETHING I CAN TAKE
TO A GRAND JURY.

24:13.586 --> 24:14.587
[school bell rings]

24:14.587 --> 24:16.489
- BENJAMIN STREPEK.

24:16.489 --> 24:18.791
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TEACHER
FROM THE FAMOUS MANOR HILL

24:18.791 --> 24:20.793
COMING TO OUR INNER CITY
CHARTER.

24:20.793 --> 24:23.229
IT WAS A SIGN WE'D ARRIVED.

24:23.229 --> 24:24.997
- HE DIDN'T WORK OUT FOR YOU?

24:24.997 --> 24:28.000
- I FIRED HIM A MONTH
AFTER HE GOT HERE.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.503
- WHAT HAPPENED?
- I HEARD VOICES

24:30.503 --> 24:32.104
COMING FROM THE BOYS'
LOCKER ROOM

24:32.104 --> 24:34.273
AND WALKED IN AND SAW HIM
WITH A EIGHTH-GRADE BOY.

24:34.273 --> 24:37.577
TOO CLOSE.
NOTHING WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING,

24:37.577 --> 24:39.546
BUT I GOT A BAD VIBE.

24:39.546 --> 24:41.147
- YOU TALK TO THE STUDENT?

24:41.147 --> 24:42.281
- HE WAS NERVOUS.

24:42.281 --> 24:44.551
HE SAID STREPEK
WAS TUTORING HIM.

24:44.551 --> 24:46.118
- IN THE LOCKER ROOM.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.988
- YEAH. EXACTLY.
I CALLED HEADMASTER LENNOX,

24:48.988 --> 24:50.990
AND HE SAID
HE'D GET BACK TO ME.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.025
THEN I SPOKE TO HIS SECRETARY,

24:53.025 --> 24:56.629
AND SHE SAID, "OFF THE RECORD,
GO WITH YOUR GUT."

24:56.629 --> 24:59.131
I CANNED STREPEK THAT DAY.

24:59.131 --> 25:02.301
- YOU SAID MANOR HILL GAVE HIM
A GOOD RECOMMENDATION?

25:02.301 --> 25:05.004
- GLOWING.
I'LL SEND YOU A COPY.

25:05.004 --> 25:07.807
- THANK YOU.

25:17.850 --> 25:20.186
- DETECTIVES,
I'M TERRIBLY SORRY,

25:20.186 --> 25:21.888
BUT THIS IS A PRIVATE EVENT.

25:21.888 --> 25:23.723
- YEAH, WE WON'T STAY LONG.
- WE HAVE A SUBPOENA.

25:23.723 --> 25:26.258
- DETECTIVE, CAN WE
TAKE THIS OUTSIDE, PLEASE?

25:26.258 --> 25:29.762
- SURE, YOU CAN.
TAKE THAT WITH YOU.

25:31.864 --> 25:35.034
- YOU'RE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY.
LEAVE NOW.

25:35.034 --> 25:39.105
- I HAVE A CORDIAL INVITATION
TO YOU FOR THE GRAND JURY.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.608
- THIS IS HARASSMENT.

25:41.608 --> 25:43.776
- LET'S CALL IT
A FISHING EXPEDITION.

25:49.315 --> 25:51.117
- HEADMASTER LENNOX,

25:51.117 --> 25:52.719
DID YOU SEND THIS LETTER

25:52.719 --> 25:54.220
RECOMMENDING BENJAMIN STREPEK

25:54.220 --> 25:56.789
TO A CHARTER SCHOOL IN HARLEM?
- YES, I DID.

25:56.789 --> 25:58.825
I'D NEVER WORKED WITH
MR. STREPEK PERSONALLY,

25:58.825 --> 26:01.293
BUT HE HAD AN IMPECCABLE
REPUTATION.

26:01.293 --> 26:03.295
- BUT WHEN THE PRINCIPAL
OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL

26:03.295 --> 26:04.597
CALLED YOU TO FOLLOW UP
ON STREPEK,

26:04.597 --> 26:05.832
YOU NEVER CALLED HER BACK.

26:05.832 --> 26:07.099
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.635
I WAS NEW TO MY JOB,
OVERWHELMED.

26:08.635 --> 26:10.202
- I SEE.

26:10.202 --> 26:11.938
IT WASN'T BECAUSE
YOU HAD SUSPICIONS

26:11.938 --> 26:14.774
YOU'D PASSED OFF DAMAGED GOODS
TO THE CHARTER SCHOOL.

26:14.774 --> 26:16.943
THAT STREPEK
WAS A SEXUAL ABUSER.

26:16.943 --> 26:18.377
- OF COURSE NOT, I--

26:18.377 --> 26:20.246
I HAD NO KNOWLEDGE
OF ANY SUCH THING.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.381
AGAIN, I HAD JUST ARRIVED
AT THE SCHOOL.

26:22.381 --> 26:24.283
- SO YOU WROTE A GLOWING
RECOMMENDATION FOR A MAN

26:24.283 --> 26:25.251
YOU HADN'T EVEN MET.

26:25.251 --> 26:26.986
DID ANYONE ON THE BOARD

26:26.986 --> 26:28.387
TELL YOU THAT A FATHER
OF ONE OF THE STUDENTS,

26:28.387 --> 26:30.723
VINCENT MORAN,
AHD MADE ALLEGATIONS

26:30.723 --> 26:32.825
OF SEXUAL ABUSE
TO THE SCHOOL

26:32.825 --> 26:34.627
ABOUT MR. STREPEK?

26:34.627 --> 26:36.328
- NO. THEY DID NOT.

26:36.328 --> 26:40.132
IF THEY HAD, I NEVER WOULD HAVE
SENT THAT RECOMMENDATION.

26:40.132 --> 26:41.634
- YOU TOLD THE PRINCIPAL
OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL

26:41.634 --> 26:43.335
TO "GO WITH HER GUT."

26:43.335 --> 26:45.838
WHAT DID YOU MEAN?
- NOTHING.

26:45.838 --> 26:48.140
JUST THAT SHE SHOULD DO WHAT SHE
THOUGHT WAS BEST FOR HER SCHOOL.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.375
- SHE DIDN'T ASK YOU
ABOUT HER SCHOOL.

26:49.375 --> 26:51.110
SHE ASKED YOU
ABOUT MR. STREPEK.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.312
- I JUST THOUGHT MAYBE
HE WASN'T A GOOD FIT THERE.

26:53.312 --> 26:54.814
- BECAUSE HE SEXUALLY
ABUSED STUDENTS.

26:54.814 --> 26:56.248
- NO.
- MR. STREPEK LEFT MANOR HILL

26:56.248 --> 26:58.050
BEFORE RETIREMENT AGE.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.152
WHY WASN'T HE A GOOD FIT THERE?

27:00.152 --> 27:03.322
- I REALLY COULDN'T SAY.
- YOU COULDN'T, OR YOU WON'T?

27:06.358 --> 27:08.027
- HOW'S IT GOING?
- MANOR HILL WITNESSES

27:08.027 --> 27:09.295
ARE PLAYING CLOSE TO THE VEST.

27:09.295 --> 27:10.730
TOO CAREFUL WITH THEIR ANSWERS.

27:10.730 --> 27:12.231
MY SENSE--
THE JURY'S SMELLING SMOKE.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.900
- WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE
YOU DON'T NEED ME.

27:13.900 --> 27:16.836
- ACTUALLY, I DO.
YOU'RE MY STAR WITNESS, OKAY?

27:16.836 --> 27:20.072
YOU'LL TESTIFY TO THE ABUSE,
THE STD.

27:20.072 --> 27:22.441
THE FACT THAT YOUR FATHER
CONFRONTED THE SCHOOL.

27:22.441 --> 27:25.044
THAT'S GONNA MAKE THE GRAND
JURY CONNECT THE DOTS.

27:25.044 --> 27:27.379
- COOL.
- OKAY.

27:27.379 --> 27:29.315
- OF COURSE I KNEW
BEN STREPEK.

27:29.315 --> 27:32.451
HE TAUGHT MY SON.
A TRUE INTELLECTUAL.

27:32.451 --> 27:34.220
WE DIDN'T SOCIALIZE,

27:34.220 --> 27:36.723
BUT HE SEEMED TOTALLY
DEVOTED TO HIS WORK.

27:36.723 --> 27:39.091
- THEN WHY WAS HE FORCED
INTO EARLY RETIREMENT?

27:39.091 --> 27:40.960
- I WASN'T AWARE THAT HE WAS.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.362
- WE HAVE HIS PERSONNEL FILE,
MR. FORRESTER.

27:43.362 --> 27:46.265
WE CAN SEE THAT HE RECEIVED
FINANCIAL COMPENSATION

27:46.265 --> 27:48.234
FOR HIS DEPARTURE.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.136
WERE YOU AT THE BOARD MEETING
WHERE THIS WAS DISCUSSED?

27:50.136 --> 27:52.404
- OF COURSE I WAS
AT THE BOARD MEETING.

27:52.404 --> 27:55.107
- CAN YOU TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED?

27:55.107 --> 27:58.210
- NINE YEARS AGO?

27:58.210 --> 28:00.279
I SERVE ON 15 DIFFERENT BOARDS

28:00.279 --> 28:02.782
IN THREE DIFFERENT TIME ZONES.

28:02.782 --> 28:05.718
THAT'S WHY THEY TAKE MINUTES.

28:05.718 --> 28:07.987
- SEE, THOSE MINUTES
SEEM TO BE MISSING

28:07.987 --> 28:09.388
FROM THE SCHOOL FILES.

28:09.388 --> 28:12.859
- I'M THE CHAIRMAN,
NOT THE DAMN SECRETARY.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.927
- BUT YOU WERE AWARE
THAT AT LEAST ONE PARENT

28:14.927 --> 28:17.964
HAD COMPLAINED THAT MR. STREPEK
HAD SEXUAL CONTACT WITH HIS SON.

28:17.964 --> 28:22.902
- I AM NOT AWARE OF THAT,
AND I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

28:22.902 --> 28:24.436
- FORRESTER ACTED LIKE

28:24.436 --> 28:26.372
HE WAS TALKING TO A ROOM
FULL OF BAD CHEESE.

28:26.372 --> 28:28.207
THE JURY'S GONNA LOVE
TAKING HIM DOWN.

28:28.207 --> 28:30.042
WHERE'S VINCENT?

28:30.042 --> 28:32.044
- HE'S NOT HERE.

28:32.044 --> 28:34.981
- HE WAS.
HE WAS RIGHT THERE.

28:34.981 --> 28:36.849
- WE'RE ON IT.

28:38.885 --> 28:41.120
[knocking at door]
- VINCENT!

28:42.789 --> 28:45.324
VINCENT MORAN!
- HEY.

28:45.324 --> 28:47.359
WHOA, WHOA, HEY, HEY,
WHERE'S VINCENT?

28:47.359 --> 28:48.494
- HE SAID HIS NAME WAS FRED.

28:48.494 --> 28:51.230
- GOT HIM.

28:51.230 --> 28:55.868
SVU PORTABLE.
I NEED A BUS AT THE DOVER HOTEL.

29:00.807 --> 29:02.108
- THEY PICKED VINCENT UP
AT A DIVE HOTEL

29:02.108 --> 29:03.910
WITH A HOOKER
AND SOME BAD COKE.

29:03.910 --> 29:05.544
- THE DOCTORS HOPE THAT HE'LL
BE COHERENT BY TOMORROW.

29:05.544 --> 29:07.313
- THAT'S JUST TERRIFIC.
- HEY, HE SCREWED UP.

29:07.313 --> 29:09.248
BUT IT SPEAKS TO YOUR CASE
'CAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM

29:09.248 --> 29:10.817
AT MANOR HILL.
- WHAT HE SAYS HAPPENED.

29:10.817 --> 29:12.819
THERE'S NO RECORD
OF HIS FATHER COMPLAINING,

29:12.819 --> 29:14.921
AND VINCENT'S CREDIBILITY
IS SHOT NOW, EVEN WITH ME.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.055
WE NEED SOMETHING TANGIBLE.

29:16.055 --> 29:17.790
- WELL, WHAT ABOUT
THE GONORRHEA?

29:17.790 --> 29:19.158
MEDICAL RECORDS
PROVE THAT HE HAD IT.

29:19.158 --> 29:20.927
- DOESN'T PROVE
WHO HE GOT IT FROM.

29:20.927 --> 29:21.727
- WHAT IF WE GET STREPEK'S
MEDICAL RECORDS,

29:21.727 --> 29:23.062
SEE IF HE HAD IT
AT THE SAME TIME?

29:23.062 --> 29:24.430
- THAT'S GOOD.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.565
THE JURY MIGHT MAKE THAT LEAP.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.567
BUT MEDICAL RECORDS ARE
PRIVILEGED, EVEN AFTER DEATH.

29:28.567 --> 29:30.302
YOU NEED PERMISSION
FROM STREPEK'S NEXT OF KIN

29:30.302 --> 29:31.804
IF YOU CAN EVEN
FIND OUT WHO THAT IS.

29:31.804 --> 29:34.306
- WE'RE ON IT.

29:36.542 --> 29:38.845
- STREPEK'S ONLY LIVING RELATIVE

29:38.845 --> 29:40.546
IS A SECOND COUSIN.
- AND?

29:40.546 --> 29:43.149
- AN AWKWARD CONVERSATION,
BUT WE GOT THE RECORDS.

29:43.149 --> 29:45.151
STREPEK DID HAVE GONORRHEA

29:45.151 --> 29:47.987
THREE WEEKS BEFORE
VINCENT MORAN WAS DIAGNOSED.

29:47.987 --> 29:49.822
- GONORRHEA--
THE GIFT THAT KEEPS GIVING.

29:49.822 --> 29:51.223
- SORRY TO INTERRUPT
THE CELEBRATION.

29:51.223 --> 29:52.959
- MS. CALHOUN.
- I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE LOOKING

29:52.959 --> 29:55.261
AT BENJAMIN STREPEK'S
MEDICAL RECORDS.

29:55.261 --> 29:57.930
- THAT WAS FAST.
- MANOR HILL IS BELOVED.

29:57.930 --> 30:00.332
YOU CAN'T USE THOSE RECORDS.
THEY'RE PRIVILEGED.

30:00.332 --> 30:03.870
- NEXT OF KIN WAIVE PRIVILEGE.
PLEASE COME AGAIN.

30:03.870 --> 30:06.572
- CPLR, SECTION 4504,
SUBSECTION C.

30:06.572 --> 30:08.574
"NO ONE CAN WAIVE

30:08.574 --> 30:10.276
"A DEAD PERSON'S PATIENT/DOCTOR
PRIVILEGE

30:10.276 --> 30:13.079
"WITH RESPECT TO RECORDS
THAT WOULD DISGRACE

30:13.079 --> 30:14.881
THE MEMORY OF THE DECEDENT."

30:14.881 --> 30:17.884
HERE IS OUR MOTION
TO THE SUPERVISING JUDGE.

30:17.884 --> 30:20.186
ALWAYS A PLEASURE.

30:22.388 --> 30:24.090
- YOU CAN'T SPEAK ILL
OF THE DEAD

30:24.090 --> 30:26.158
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE
SPEAKING ILL OF THE DEAD?

30:26.158 --> 30:28.560
SHE'S GOTTA BE JOKING.
- SHE'S NOT. IT'S A LAW.

30:28.560 --> 30:32.198
AN OBSCURE ONE, BUT A LAW.
- SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

30:32.198 --> 30:34.066
- ARGUE THAT IT DOESN'T APPLY.

30:34.066 --> 30:36.635
- BUT WHAT STREPEK DID
WAS DISGRACEFUL.

30:36.635 --> 30:39.238
- MAYBE NOT, IF WE CAN PUT THIS
THING IN A DIFFERENT CONTEXT.

30:39.238 --> 30:41.573
YOU THINK IT WAS DISGRACEFUL.
I THINK IT WAS DISGRACEFUL.

30:41.573 --> 30:43.910
THAT TEACHER THAT YOU
INTERVIEWED, UH...TOMPKINS.

30:43.910 --> 30:45.611
HE SAID BACK IN THE DAY,
SEX WITH STUDENTS

30:45.611 --> 30:48.981
WAS WARM AND AFFECTIONATE,
NOT DISGRACEFUL.

30:48.981 --> 30:52.952
GET HIM TO TELL THAT
TO THE JUDGE.

30:52.952 --> 30:55.321
- SO WE'RE GOING TO ARGUE
THAT...

30:55.321 --> 30:58.390
RAPING BOYS
IS MORALLY ACCEPTABLE.

30:58.390 --> 30:59.959
- RAPING BOYS.

30:59.959 --> 31:02.661
TOMPKINS SAID THAT IT WAS
LOVING, CONSENSUAL SEX.

31:02.661 --> 31:04.931
- [laughs].

31:04.931 --> 31:07.934
- LOSE THE BATTLE.
WIN THE WAR.

31:14.206 --> 31:16.375
- I KNOW THAT TIMES
HAVE CHANGED.

31:16.375 --> 31:20.412
WE ALL UNDERSTAND MORE NOW
THAN WE DID THEN.

31:20.412 --> 31:22.648
I UNDERSTAND MORE NOW
THAN I DID THEN.

31:22.648 --> 31:24.483
- HOW SO?

31:24.483 --> 31:27.119
- WELL, AT THE TIME,
I FELT RELATIONSHIPS

31:27.119 --> 31:29.621
BETWEEN TEACHERS
AND OLDER STUDENTS

31:29.621 --> 31:31.991
WERE NOT NECESSARILY WRONG

31:31.991 --> 31:33.692
IF ONE'S HEART WAS IN IT.

31:33.692 --> 31:36.162
MAYBE I WAS NAIVE.

31:36.162 --> 31:38.164
I DIDN'T MEAN
TO HURT ANYONE.

31:38.164 --> 31:40.632
- BUT WAS THIS A COMMON ATTITUDE
AT THE SCHOOL

31:40.632 --> 31:42.601
AMONG BOTH TEACHERS
AND STUDENTS?

31:42.601 --> 31:46.072
- IT CERTAINLY WASN'T CONDEMNED
THE WAY IT IS TODAY.

31:46.072 --> 31:48.140
- THANK YOU.
- SO YOU'RE SAYING

31:48.140 --> 31:51.978
THAT THIS KIND OF THING
WAS NOT DISGRACEFUL.

31:51.978 --> 31:55.047
- WELL, IT DIDN'T
NECESSARILY SEEM SO, NO.

31:55.047 --> 31:56.615
- SO DID YOU ANNOUNCE IT
PUBLICLY

31:56.615 --> 31:58.584
WHENEVER YOU HAD SEX
WITH A STUDENT?

31:58.584 --> 31:59.718
- OF COURSE NOT.

31:59.718 --> 32:02.054
- IF IT WAS ALL HUNKY-DORY,
WHY NOT?

32:02.054 --> 32:03.622
- IT WAS PRIVATE.

32:03.622 --> 32:05.624
- IT WAS WRONG.
YOUR HONOR,

32:05.624 --> 32:08.560
THIS ARGUMENT
IS PREPOSTEROUS ON ITS FACE.

32:08.560 --> 32:10.462
- WHAT'S NEXT?
IS MR. BARBA

32:10.462 --> 32:12.231
GOING TO BRING IN A CANNIBAL

32:12.231 --> 32:15.167
TO TELL US HOW EATING PEOPLE
IS WHOLESOME AND HEALTHY?

32:15.167 --> 32:16.502
- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
ATTITUDES TOWARD SEX

32:16.502 --> 32:18.170
THAT SHIFT OVER TIME

32:18.170 --> 32:20.506
AND THE ATTITUDE
THAT MR. TOMPKINS IS DESCRIBING

32:20.506 --> 32:22.474
WAS APPARENTLY PREVALENT
AT MANOR HILL ACADEMY.

32:22.474 --> 32:25.544
HOW ELSE TO EXPLAIN
SO MANY UNREPORTED INCIDENTS

32:25.544 --> 32:27.679
OF TEACHER/STUDENT
SEXUAL CONTACT?

32:27.679 --> 32:29.681
THEY WERE AS COMMON
AS TRUST FUNDS.

32:29.681 --> 32:31.750
- SAVE IT FOR THE NEXT MARCH
ON WALL STREET.

32:31.750 --> 32:33.986
- ALL RIGHT, MS. CALHOUN.
I TAKE YOUR POINT.

32:33.986 --> 32:35.654
THE RELEASE
OF THESE MEDICAL RECORDS--

32:35.654 --> 32:37.323
NO MATTER HOW YOU SPIN
THE ALLEGED ACTS--

32:37.323 --> 32:39.758
WOULD BRING DISGRACE
TO THE DECEASED.

32:39.758 --> 32:41.527
YOUR GRAND JURY CAN PROCEED,

32:41.527 --> 32:43.962
BUT WITHOUT
MR. STREPEK'S MEDICAL RECORDS.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.668
- I'M SORRY.
I'M SORRY FOR IT ALL.

32:54.706 --> 32:57.643
- WELL, THAT WAS ENLIGHTENING.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.645
- WE'RE NOT DONE WITH THIS.

32:59.645 --> 33:02.014
- OH, I THINK WE ARE.

33:02.014 --> 33:03.749
I'M SURE YOU'LL BE
INTERESTED TO KNOW

33:03.749 --> 33:06.685
THAT THE SCHOOL WILL BE
ISSUING A STATEMENT SHORTLY.

33:06.685 --> 33:09.721
- TAKING RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE CULTURE OF ABUSE

33:09.721 --> 33:12.124
AND THE DAMAGE IT CAUSED?

33:12.124 --> 33:14.626
- I DON'T KNOW THAT THERE
WAS ANY CULTURE.

33:14.626 --> 33:16.662
THERE WAS ONE BAD APPLE.

33:16.662 --> 33:19.598
YOUR WITNESS.
TOMPKINS.

33:19.598 --> 33:21.800
- SO YOU'RE GONNA SCAPEGOAT
THE ONE PERSON

33:21.800 --> 33:24.403
WHO'S COME FORWARD--WHO
NO ONE EVEN COMPLAINED ABOUT.

33:24.403 --> 33:26.605
- I'M SCAPEGOATING?

33:26.605 --> 33:28.640
YOU HEARD HIM ON THE STAND--

33:28.640 --> 33:31.043
A SELF-CONFESSED PEDERAST.

33:31.043 --> 33:33.212
I'M...

33:33.212 --> 33:36.448
SHOCKED AND DISMAYED
THAT HE WORKED FOR US.

33:36.448 --> 33:39.251
IT'S A TERRIBLE THING.

33:39.251 --> 33:42.788
IT'S VERY UPSETTING.

33:45.091 --> 33:48.460
- A NEWS BRIEF JUST POSTED
BY THE LEDGER.

33:48.460 --> 33:50.096
"MANOR HILL HAS BEEN MADE AWARE

33:50.096 --> 33:52.731
"OF THE PEDOPHILE
WHO TAUGHT THERE DECADES AGO.

33:52.731 --> 33:55.834
THE SCHOOL IS OUTRAGED
THAT HE CAN'T BE PROSECUTED."

33:55.834 --> 33:57.703
OTHERWISE, EVERYTHING
IS ALL GOOD THERE,

33:57.703 --> 34:00.272
ALWAYS HAS BEEN.
- SMART PLAY.

34:00.272 --> 34:02.208
BURYING THE BIG STORY
WITH THE LITTLE ONE.

34:02.208 --> 34:04.576
BARBA HAVE A PLAN
TO GET PAST THIS?

34:04.576 --> 34:07.379
- HE SAYS HE'S OPEN
TO SUGGESTIONS.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.581
- THAT WAS ONE
OF THE FORMER STUDENTS

34:09.581 --> 34:11.383
TOMPKINS
HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH.

34:11.383 --> 34:13.685
HE SAW THE ARTICLE TOO,
AND HE WANTS TO COME IN.

34:16.322 --> 34:18.090
- SO ARE YOU GONNA ARREST
WALTER TOMPKINS?

34:18.090 --> 34:20.726
- NO. IT'S BEEN TOO LONG.

34:20.726 --> 34:24.396
I'M SO SORRY IF YOU WANTED
TO TESTIFY AGAINST HIM.

34:24.396 --> 34:26.498
- AGAINST HIM?

34:26.498 --> 34:28.500
I WANT TO TESTIFY FOR HIM.

34:28.500 --> 34:32.604
- YOU SAID THAT HE HAD SEX WITH
YOU WHEN YOU WERE A STUDENT.

34:32.604 --> 34:34.206
- I WAS 18.

34:34.206 --> 34:36.675
LOOK, I'D KNOWN I WAS GAY
SINCE I WAS 6.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.677
IT'S VERY HARD.

34:38.677 --> 34:41.480
WALTER LET ME KNOW
IT WAS OKAY.

34:41.480 --> 34:43.749
- WELL, WE'VE MET A LOT OF
FORMER MANOR HILL STUDENTS

34:43.749 --> 34:46.318
WHO DON'T FEEL OKAY ABOUT WHAT
HAPPENED TO THEM THERE.

34:46.318 --> 34:49.355
- THEN THEY WEREN'T
INVOLVED WITH WALT.

34:49.355 --> 34:52.191
BUT YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT
THIS OTHER TEACHER, STREPEK?

34:52.191 --> 34:53.759
- THE NAME'S COME UP.

34:53.759 --> 34:55.761
- STREPEK.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.197
SOMEHOW...FOUND OUT ABOUT
THE RELATIONSHIP

34:58.197 --> 35:00.632
BETWEEN ME AND TOMPKINS.

35:00.632 --> 35:03.569
I GUESS I SEEMED LIKE
EASY PICKINGS.

35:03.569 --> 35:06.338
CAME ON TO ME.
HE WAS PUSHING HIMSELF ON ME.

35:06.338 --> 35:08.740
I TOLD MY MOTHER
WHAT STREPEK WAS UP TO.

35:08.740 --> 35:11.343
SHE WROTE A LETTER TO THE SCHOOL
COMPLAINING ABOUT HIM.

35:11.343 --> 35:14.646
- DO YOU HAVE A COPY
OF THAT LETTER?

35:14.646 --> 35:17.383
- NO.

35:19.151 --> 35:21.653
BUT I SAW THE LETTER
THEY WROTE BACK.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.922
IT WAS SIGNED BY A MEMBER
OF THE BOARD--FORRESTER.

35:23.922 --> 35:26.292
- BRETT FORRESTER.
- YEAH.

35:26.292 --> 35:28.194
SON OF A BITCH.

35:28.194 --> 35:31.563
- IS THERE ANY CHANCE
YOUR MOTHER KEPT THAT LETTER?

35:31.563 --> 35:33.799
- I DON'T KNOW.

35:40.606 --> 35:42.608
- YOU WROTE THIS TO A MOTHER
OF A STUDENT WHO COMPLAINED

35:42.608 --> 35:44.443
THAT HE'D BEEN SEXUALLY
ASSAULTED BY BENJAMIN STREPEK.

35:44.443 --> 35:46.312
"YOUR SON MUST HAVE
MISUNDERSTOOD

35:46.312 --> 35:48.380
"OR EXAGGERATED WHAT HAPPENED

35:48.380 --> 35:50.382
"BETWEEN HIM
AND THE TEACHER IN QUESTION.

35:50.382 --> 35:52.418
"MR. STREPEK'S CHARACTER
AND BEHAVIOR

35:52.418 --> 35:54.353
ARE BEYOND REPROACH."

35:54.353 --> 35:56.288
- IF YOU TOLD THE GRAND JURY
YOU WEREN'T AWARE

35:56.288 --> 35:59.525
OF COMPLAINTS AGAINST STREPEK,
YOU COMMITTED PERJURY.

35:59.525 --> 36:00.959
- MAY I SEE THAT, PLEASE?

36:00.959 --> 36:04.830
28 YEARS AGO, AND YOU
EXPECT ME TO REMEMBER THIS?

36:04.830 --> 36:06.898
- BUT YOU DO NOW?
THAT'S CONVENIENT.

36:06.898 --> 36:08.967
- IT'S THE TRUTH.
TRY TO PROVE IT ISN'T.

36:08.967 --> 36:10.669
AND THIS IS TRUE TOO.

36:10.669 --> 36:13.972
STREPEK WAS NOT
A SEXUAL PREDATOR.

36:13.972 --> 36:16.375
- AND YOU KNOW THAT HOW
EXACTLY?

36:16.375 --> 36:18.677
- YOU DIDN'T KNOW THE MAN.
I KNEW HIM--MY SON KNEW HIM.

36:18.677 --> 36:20.512
- IS THIS YOUR SON NATHAN?
- YES.

36:20.512 --> 36:22.248
I ASKED HIM ABOUT
THE COMPLAINT AT THE TIME.

36:22.248 --> 36:25.684
HE TOLD ME THE BOY THE MADE IT
WAS A CRYBABY, A SCREW-UP.

36:25.684 --> 36:28.220
- AND HE SAID
THAT IT COULDN'T BE TRUE.

36:28.220 --> 36:30.256
- YES. MY SON
WAS IN STREPEK'S CLASS.

36:30.256 --> 36:32.224
YOU THINK I WOULD HAVE
LEFT HIM THERE

36:32.224 --> 36:33.825
IF THE MAN WAS
A SEXUAL MOLESTER?

36:33.825 --> 36:35.761
- IS YOUR SON HERE NOW?

36:35.761 --> 36:37.963
- HE HAS AN APARTMENT
IN OUR GUEST HOUSE. WHY?

36:37.963 --> 36:40.232
- NATHAN, THESE ARE DETECTIVES.

36:40.232 --> 36:42.000
- WE MET.

36:42.000 --> 36:44.002
A FEW NIGHTS AGO
WITH CURT HASKINS

36:44.002 --> 36:45.737
AND SOME OTHER ALUMNI.

36:45.737 --> 36:48.307
- YEAH. I STILL DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU WERE DOING THERE.

36:52.911 --> 36:56.014
- WE'RE INVESTIGATING
SEXUAL ASSAULTS AT YOUR SCHOOL.

36:56.014 --> 36:58.584
ONE NAME CAME UP
AFTER YOU LEFT.

36:58.584 --> 37:00.886
- ONE OF YOUR OLD TEACHERS.
MR. STREPEK.

37:00.886 --> 37:02.888
- I TOLD THEM WHAT YOU TOLD ME

37:02.888 --> 37:05.023
WHEN HE WAS FIRST
FALSELY ACCUSED.

37:05.023 --> 37:07.025
- CAN YOU TELL US, NATHAN?

37:07.025 --> 37:09.928
- I DON'T REALLY REMEMBER.

37:09.928 --> 37:12.864
- BUT WE HEARD HE SEXUALLY
ASSAULTED YOUR CLASSMATES.

37:12.864 --> 37:14.366
- THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THAT NEVER HAPPENED.

37:14.366 --> 37:16.468
- REALLY?
AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA

37:16.468 --> 37:20.005
WHY YOU WERE INVITED TO THE
LITTLE REUNION THE OTHER NIGHT?

37:20.005 --> 37:23.008
- NOT A CLUE.
IT WAS RIDICULOUS.

37:25.444 --> 37:29.681
- SO YOU
LIVE HERE BY YOURSELF, NATHAN?

37:29.681 --> 37:31.049
- WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO
WITH ANYTHING?

37:31.049 --> 37:32.618
- YOUR SON DOESN'T WORK

37:32.618 --> 37:34.920
AT THE FAMILY BROKERAGE FIRM
WITH YOU,

37:34.920 --> 37:36.922
DOES HE?
- WHAT IS THE RELEVANCE

37:36.922 --> 37:38.590
OF THAT QUESTION?

37:38.590 --> 37:39.925
- WHAT DO YOU DO, NATHAN?

37:39.925 --> 37:42.027
- I--[ahem].

37:42.027 --> 37:44.330
BEEN WRITING SOME SONGS.
- NICE.

37:44.330 --> 37:46.532
CAN WE HEAR THEM ANYWHERE?

37:46.532 --> 37:49.000
- I HAVEN'T...
PUBLISHED THEM YET.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.836
- I'LL INVITE YOU
TO THE FIRST CONCERT.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.938
LEAVE. NOW.
WE'RE DONE.

37:52.938 --> 37:54.806
- NOT QUITE.

37:54.806 --> 37:56.642
YOU KNOW, WHEN WE FIRST MET,
MR. FORRESTER,

37:56.642 --> 38:00.879
YOU TOLD US THAT SOME PEOPLE
LIVE DISAPPOINTING LIVES.

38:00.879 --> 38:03.649
- AND?
- ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED?

38:03.649 --> 38:06.585
THAT NATHAN DIDN'T JOIN
THE FAMILY FIRM,

38:06.585 --> 38:08.887
THAT HE WRITES SONGS
HERE IN YOUR HOUSE

38:08.887 --> 38:10.822
THAT NOBODY WILL SING?

38:12.758 --> 38:17.363
- I REALLY DON'T SEE HOW
THAT'S ANY OF YOUR CONCERN.

38:17.363 --> 38:19.064
- IT IS IF IT HAS TO DO
WITH BENJAMIN STREPEK.

38:19.064 --> 38:21.600
- HE'S ALREADY TOLD YOU

38:21.600 --> 38:25.737
THE ANSWER TO THOSE
RIDICULOUS CHARGES.

38:25.737 --> 38:29.841
- SO I'M GONNA ASK YOU
ONE LAST TIME, NATHAN.

38:29.841 --> 38:32.844
ARE YOU SURE THAT MR. STREPEK

38:32.844 --> 38:34.413
DIDN'T RAPE ANY STUDENTS?

38:34.413 --> 38:36.582
- TELL THEM AGAIN, NATHAN,

38:36.582 --> 38:39.351
SO THEY'LL GET OUT OF HERE.

38:39.351 --> 38:42.588
- AND WHAT, DAD?

38:42.588 --> 38:44.022
NO, YOU'RE RIGHT, DAD.

38:44.022 --> 38:46.758
MUST SAVE THE GOOD NAME
OF MANOR HILL.

38:46.758 --> 38:49.928
- THAT SCHOOL.
MANOR HILL.

38:49.928 --> 38:52.531
THAT'S ALL YOUR FATHER
EVER CARED ABOUT, ISN'T IT?

38:52.531 --> 38:55.567
- MEANT A LOT TO NATHAN, TOO.
HE DID WELL THERE.

38:55.567 --> 39:00.372
- DID YOU, NATHAN?
REALLY?

39:00.372 --> 39:04.075
- UNTIL, UH, UPPER SCHOOL,
AND THEN, UH...

39:04.075 --> 39:06.712
I HAD MR. STREPEK.

39:06.712 --> 39:10.516
AND, UH, AFTER THAT, MY...

39:10.516 --> 39:11.950
GRADES KIND OF WENT TO HELL,

39:11.950 --> 39:16.422
AND SO DID A LOT OF
OTHER THINGS.

39:16.422 --> 39:18.590
DID YOU EVER LOOK AT ME?

39:18.590 --> 39:22.060
DID YOU EVER NOTICE WHAT WAS
REALLY HAPPENING TO ME?

39:22.060 --> 39:24.896
- HE WAS...
A TOUGH TEACHER.

39:24.896 --> 39:26.698
HE CHALLENGED YOU.

39:26.698 --> 39:28.900
- YEAH, HE CHALLENGED ME.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.737
I COULDN'T TELL YOU, DAD,
YOU'D JUST...

39:31.737 --> 39:34.005
CALL ME A FAIRY
LIKE YOU DID THAT OTHER KID

39:34.005 --> 39:38.076
WHOSE MOTHER
WROTE THE LETTER.

39:38.076 --> 39:39.545
AND THEN THE SCHOOL!

39:39.545 --> 39:43.081
IT WOULD HAVE HURT
YOUR PRECIOUS SCHOOL.

39:47.719 --> 39:51.122
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO.
I DON'T REMEMBER.

39:53.992 --> 39:56.495
- [whispers]
NATHAN.

40:06.505 --> 40:09.908
- STRANGE DAYS.
THEY SENT A CAR FOR US.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.943
- HOW YOU DOING?

40:11.943 --> 40:13.879
- BETTER.
- YOU COMING IN?

40:13.879 --> 40:16.948
- WE WOULDN'T MISS IT.

40:16.948 --> 40:19.951
- TODAY...

40:19.951 --> 40:23.955
OUR SCHOOL BEGINS
A HEALING PROCESS.

40:23.955 --> 40:27.058
WE ARE GONNA TALK ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED HERE,

40:27.058 --> 40:29.761
TRY TO LEARN FROM IT,

40:29.761 --> 40:33.532
AND MAKE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
THAT IT NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN.

40:33.532 --> 40:34.933
THIS IS NOT
GOING TO BE EASY...

40:34.933 --> 40:37.102
- YOU HAPPY, DETECTIVE?

40:37.102 --> 40:39.638
- AS A MATTER OF FACT, I AM.

40:39.638 --> 40:41.139
- THE GRAND JURY
COULD PROBABLY

40:41.139 --> 40:43.975
STILL INDICT SOME OF THESE
PEOPLE FOR SOMETHING.

40:43.975 --> 40:47.245
- I CAN GET THE INDICTMENT.
I'LL NEVER GET THE CONVICTION.

40:47.245 --> 40:50.248
BUT THAT WAS NEVER REALLY
THE POINT, WAS IT?

40:50.248 --> 40:51.683
- THE CHAIRMAN OF OUR BOARD,
MR. BRETT FORRESTER.

40:51.683 --> 40:53.685
MR. FORRESTER.

41:06.998 --> 41:09.935
- NOTHING CAN EVER UNDO
THE DAMAGE

41:09.935 --> 41:11.803
THAT WAS DONE HERE.

41:15.841 --> 41:17.976
BUT WE WILL HELP
AND SUPPORT THOSE

41:17.976 --> 41:21.680
WHO WERE VICTIMIZED.

41:21.680 --> 41:25.517
WE WILL LAUNCH A THOROUGH
INVESTIGATION

41:25.517 --> 41:27.018
OF THOSE RESPONSIBLE.

41:36.161 --> 41:38.229
FOR WHATEVER IT'S WORTH,

41:38.229 --> 41:42.200
ON BEHALF OF MANOR HILL
ACADEMY...

41:46.204 --> 41:49.274
I APOLOGIZE.
