Yeah, right. I was traumatized
because I didn't have

15:58.040 --> 15:59.208
-any sex at all.
-STAN: Same here.

15:59.291 --> 16:01.043
I couldn't fucking
pay a woman to touch me!

16:01.126 --> 16:02.878
All right.
I'm gonna go talk to him.

16:02.961 --> 16:04.672
-And take the glasses.
-Yeah.

16:04.755 --> 16:06.799
And talk to him about
what glasses Larry would wear.

16:06.882 --> 16:09.927
-LARRY: Yeah, okay.
-Lucky little fucker.

16:11.595 --> 16:14.682
-Hey, Larry.
-Good to see you, Larry.

16:14.765 --> 16:17.559
Having some problems
picking out glasses?

16:17.643 --> 16:19.186
Yeah, it's a real...
it's a conundrum.

16:19.269 --> 16:20.813
-Yeah, I'll bet.
-Yeah. I mean-- Yeah.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.940

You're acting like
kind of an asshole, and...

16:24.358 --> 16:26.860
-Uh-huh.
-...there could be
a justification for it,

16:26.944 --> 16:28.737
because I know
how traumatized you were

16:28.821 --> 16:31.699
from that horrible incident
you had when you were 17

16:31.782 --> 16:34.660
-and sexually abused
by a beautiful, luscious...

-You heard about that, huh?

16:37.538 --> 16:39.039
Oh, my God.
I can't even imagine...

16:39.123 --> 16:41.417
-how horrible that must've been.
-No, you can't. It was so hard.

16:41.500 --> 16:42.668
-Let me ask you a question.
-Yeah.

16:42.751 --> 16:44.086
-How did that work exactly?
-Yeah. Well...

16:44.169 --> 16:46.213
Did she-- did she get you
in a headlock or, uh...

16:46.296 --> 16:48.966
No, I mean, listen,
it was a mental... headlock.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.427
-All right, cut the shit. Okay?
-ASA: Yeah.

16:51.510 --> 16:53.387
-You were 17 years old.
-Uh-huh.

you would've been thrilled

-Yeah.
-I see what-- Okay.

What if you were
in high school, huh?

17:01.061 --> 17:02.396
-LARRY: Yeah.
-And you-- and you slept

17:02.479 --> 17:05.065
with an older, famous actress,
how would people treat you?

17:05.149 --> 17:07.401
They would've named

19:43.056 --> 19:45.434
Didn't you tell me the other day
that you would never canvass?

19:45.517 --> 19:46.810
No, I wouldn't canvass with you

19:46.894 --> 19:48.770
because you turn people off,
and I didn't...

like people.

we should really get going.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.256

about people,

20:18.300 --> 20:20.302
and you don't give a shit
about politics.

20:20.385 --> 20:23.388
Well, you know,
maybe when I was married to you,

20:23.472 --> 20:25.098
you held me back from

20:25.182 --> 20:26.934
the person
I really wanted to be.

20:27.017 --> 20:29.227
What's on your...
your sweatshirt?

20:29.311 --> 20:30.979
A pin for Mayhew.

20:31.063 --> 20:34.816
You hate pins 'cause they make
holes in your sweater.

20:34.900 --> 20:36.276
Well, it's a thin pin.

20:36.360 --> 20:37.778
-Oh.
-Ah. A thin pin.

-A thin pin.
-It's a thin pin.

to... to, uh, to Faulkner.
-It's what you have to do.

-Thank you.
-What's wrong with Faulkner?

20:44.368 --> 20:47.120

a great interest in
turn-of-the-century Mississippi.

everything else.

-The pens, the cups.
-He wants the cups...

to be dolphin-friendly.

even mean, Larry?

And if he flicks his fingers
at me one more time,

22:29.556 --> 22:31.933
I'm telling you now, man,
I'll shove those fingers

22:32.017 --> 22:34.603
so far up his arse,
they'll pop out of his mouth

22:34.686 --> 22:36.438
and he can use them
as a hand puppet.

22:36.521 --> 22:37.731
-Oh, boy.

22:37.814 --> 22:41.026

Okay? Zero calories in these.

all over that, Lar.

-and had sex in her trailer.
-He was 17?

23:01.213 --> 23:02.547

a 400,000-dollar settlement,

and now he's playing the victim!

23:06.426 --> 23:07.803

of his life.

23:10.931 --> 23:13.308
got a piece of ass,
which is priceless.

23:13.391 --> 23:15.811
Then he got 400,000 dollars
on top of that shit?

23:15.894 --> 23:17.312
-Yeah.
-LEON: And the movie paid him.

23:17.395 --> 23:18.730
He got paid three fucking times,

23:18.814 --> 23:20.232
-and he still complains.
-Exactly. (LAUGHS)

23:20.315 --> 23:21.775
How old were you
when you first got laid?

23:21.858 --> 23:22.943
Fourteen years old.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.236
-Fourteen?
-So if you were
in the Boy Scouts,

23:24.319 --> 23:26.196
you would've got
your, uh, intercourse badge.

Hi there. Good afternoon.
Uh, before I take your order,

I wanna let you know that
we do have a special today.

23:49.136 --> 23:51.513

23:58.603 --> 24:00.313
I'll take one, and could you
go in and secure it for me,

24:00.397 --> 24:01.481
so they don't get taken?

24:01.565 --> 24:03.233

SUSIE: So true.
One vote makes a difference.

30:52.433 --> 30:53.726
-IRMA: One vote!
-SUSIE: This is why you...

30:53.810 --> 30:56.479
-LARRY: It's outrageous!
-How do you lose by one vote?

30:56.563 --> 30:58.147
ASA: (SHOUTING) I know!

31:00.149 --> 31:03.361
I know how we lost by one vote.

31:03.444 --> 31:07.532
Larry David thought
the line was too long,

31:07.615 --> 31:08.700
so he didn't vote.

31:08.783 --> 31:10.076
-(CROWD GASPING)
-You didn't vote?

31:10.159 --> 31:11.744
-Is that true, Larry?
-What?

31:11.828 --> 31:13.830
-SUSIE: You lazy shit!
-No, that's not true,
it's not true, it's not true.

31:13.913 --> 31:15.790
ASA: I watched the whole thing.

31:15.873 --> 31:17.959
I watched you walk away
from the line,

31:18.042 --> 31:20.878
and throw your voting pin
in the trash can.

31:20.962 --> 31:22.964
-(CROWD GASPS)
-ASA: Isn't that right, Larry?

31:23.047 --> 31:24.966
All right, all right, let me
explain what happened, okay?

31:25.049 --> 31:28.636
-One damn vote.
-No! Let me explain!
Let me explain!

31:28.720 --> 31:31.139
All the canvassing.
I don't believe it.

31:31.222 --> 31:33.099
I made a deal
with a Reimenschneider voter.

31:33.182 --> 31:34.851
You don't care
about Santa Monica.

31:34.934 --> 31:37.562
-You only care about yourself!
-No! I made a deal!

31:37.645 --> 31:39.647
The line was so long,
so we both decided to leave,

31:39.731 --> 31:42.650
because we would cancel
each other out,
so it didn't make a difference.

31:42.734 --> 31:45.236
-Bullshit! I call bullshit.
-Absolutely selfish.

31:45.320 --> 31:48.031
The family is lovely,
just lovely people.

31:48.114 --> 31:50.783
Fry him! Fry him! Get him!

31:50.867 --> 31:52.827
What's the difference who voted?

31:52.910 --> 31:55.538
He would've lost anyway.
It's not my fault.

31:55.622 --> 31:58.833
It was that fucking widow,
Ruth Berman!
