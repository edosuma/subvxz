It's a packed house tonight.

06:11.375 --> 06:12.959
The money's sick.

06:13.041 --> 06:13.917
- I told you I was
gonna run late.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.250
- Yeah, hey, you
remember that thing I

06:15.333 --> 06:17.458
was talking to you about right?

06:17.542 --> 06:19.333
I mean, I could
really use the cash.

06:19.417 --> 06:20.166
- I told you no.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.291
- You could pay off some debts.

06:21.375 --> 06:23.625
And I could do some
things for you.

06:23.709 --> 06:24.792
(grunting)

06:24.875 --> 06:26.041
- Listen to me.

06:26.125 --> 06:26.959
Do I have to knock some sense

06:27.041 --> 06:28.125
into that skull of yours?

06:28.208 --> 06:29.625
We don't skim the bottom line,

06:29.709 --> 06:31.959
we don't steal and we
don't throw fights.

06:32.041 --> 06:33.917
Kendra's got a real shot here.

06:34.000 --> 06:35.291
Don't blow it.

06:36.458 --> 06:39.667
Petrov hears you
talking like this,

06:39.750 --> 06:41.125
I won't be able to protect you.

06:41.208 --> 06:42.000
- Okay.

You know it's her
big fight tonight.

07:38.667 --> 07:42.291
So I just talked to
Derrick from the WSOF.

Find the right time to make
your attacks, all right?

10:54.250 --> 10:56.542
You're coming in too
hot and too heavy.

10:56.625 --> 10:57.750

gonna get you hurt.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.083
The anger is gonna get you hurt.

11:08.166 --> 11:09.041
This is not personal.

11:09.125 --> 11:10.917
Just slow down and breathe.

11:11.000 --> 11:12.291

Good, nice big deep breaths.

11:16.667 --> 11:18.041
Don't let this anger
catch you up, okay?

11:18.125 --> 11:19.291
They're watching this close,

so keep putting on
a show, alright?

11:22.250 --> 11:24.083

11:24.166 --> 11:25.417
You're doing great, Zoey.

11:25.500 --> 11:27.458
You're doing great, keep
closing that distance.

11:27.542 --> 11:29.750
Keep impressing these
guys from the WSOF.

11:29.834 --> 11:31.125

Time's up.

11:35.625 --> 11:36.500
- Come on.

11:39.875 --> 11:43.250
- Never thought in
a million, Kendra!

11:43.333 --> 11:44.875
God's sake, throwing a fight.

11:44.959 --> 11:47.375
The fucking money must
have been amazing for her!

11:47.458 --> 11:48.834
Bitch crossed me.

11:50.667 --> 11:53.917
You want some of that shit?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.125
Hey, what gives, man?

11:56.208 --> 11:58.125
- Who did you talk to?

11:58.208 --> 11:59.792
- What the fuck are
you talking about?

11:59.875 --> 12:02.375
- Last week was 100,000 short.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.917
- Man, that's
impossible, alright,

12:06.000 --> 12:08.083
I counted that shit myself.

12:08.166 --> 12:08.959
Okay, it wasn't me.

12:09.041 --> 12:09.709
(speaking in foreign language)

12:09.792 --> 12:11.959
(grunting)

12:12.041 --> 12:14.041

12:15.000 --> 12:15.041
- Petrov!

12:18.834 --> 12:20.375
I'm tired of you messing
with my fighters and

12:20.458 --> 12:22.959
(tense music)

12:25.000 --> 12:25.041
my people.

12:27.041 --> 12:29.625
- And what are you
going to do about it?

12:29.709 --> 12:30.917
- Whoa, no need for guns.

12:32.792 --> 12:34.250
(sniffs)

12:34.333 --> 12:36.709
(grunting)

12:39.083 --> 12:40.166
(crowd cheering)

12:40.250 --> 12:42.667
(grunting)

12:44.417 --> 12:45.542
- Keep moving!

12:45.625 --> 12:46.333
(grunting)

12:46.417 --> 12:49.166
(blows thudding)

12:53.750 --> 12:55.875
(grunting)

13:05.917 --> 13:06.667
(grunting)

13:06.750 --> 13:09.583
(crowd cheering)

13:11.583 --> 13:13.750
- Get up, Zoey, get up.

13:13.834 --> 13:15.000
Fight to your feet!

13:15.083 --> 13:15.125
Come on!

13:16.959 --> 13:17.291
- [Man] She goes down!

13:17.375 --> 13:19.041
(grunting)

13:19.125 --> 13:20.041
There you go!

13:22.500 --> 13:23.625
- You go get his money.

13:23.709 --> 13:25.417
You go get it and you bring
it back to him right now!

13:25.500 --> 13:27.375
- You heard the motherfucker,
man, we gotta do him.

13:27.458 --> 13:29.000
We gotta kill him
before he kills us.

13:29.083 --> 13:29.458
- I'm not killing
anybody, go get his money.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.875
- What money?

13:31.959 --> 13:32.542
I ain't got the money.

13:32.625 --> 13:34.750
I never touched it!

13:34.834 --> 13:35.709
He's trying to fuck us!

13:35.792 --> 13:38.250
- What're you talking about?

13:38.333 --> 13:39.333
- Fuck you, bitch!

13:39.417 --> 13:39.750
(gun firing)

13:39.834 --> 13:42.709
(screaming)

13:46.417 --> 13:47.041
- Put the gun down.

13:48.709 --> 13:50.709
Put the gun down, come on.

13:50.792 --> 13:53.625
- There's a lot of
fucking money missing.

13:53.709 --> 13:56.625
And the bratva noticed. (sighs)

13:56.709 --> 13:59.750
This is business, Javier.

14:00.750 --> 14:02.792
And they're not going to stop

14:02.875 --> 14:05.583
until they find that cash.

14:05.667 --> 14:10.417
So now, I have to make it look
like you two fucks took it,

14:12.000 --> 14:13.625
and I'm in the clear.

14:13.709 --> 14:14.792
- Petrov!

14:14.875 --> 14:16.208
(somber music)

14:16.291 --> 14:16.333
- Natalia.

14:19.166 --> 14:23.166
I have everything under
control, like you asked.

14:26.208 --> 14:28.458
(screaming)

14:28.542 --> 14:31.250
- You are going to shut
your fucking mouth.

14:31.333 --> 14:33.583
(screaming)

14:42.709 --> 14:43.583
Javier.

14:44.375 --> 14:46.041
- Natalia.

14:47.875 --> 14:49.166
What's going on?

14:50.375 --> 14:53.458
- Somebody's going to
take the fall for this.

14:53.542 --> 14:54.458
And it won't be me.

14:54.542 --> 14:55.291
(intense music)

14:55.375 --> 14:58.500
(grunting)

14:58.583 --> 15:01.208
(gun clicking)

15:04.709 --> 15:07.500
(wood clattering)

15:18.542 --> 15:21.375
(gun firing)

15:21.458 --> 15:22.709
(crowd cheering)
(blows thudding)

15:22.792 --> 15:24.917
- [Woman] Come on,
come on, go, fight!

15:25.000 --> 15:26.583
- Get your hands
up, you got this!

15:26.667 --> 15:28.000
(grunting)

15:28.083 --> 15:29.333
- [Woman] Keep your hands
up, keep your hands up!

15:29.417 --> 15:30.917
Keep your hands up,
come on, come on!

15:31.000 --> 15:33.917
(heavy breathing)

15:35.208 --> 15:36.417
(gun firing)
(blows thudding)

15:36.500 --> 15:36.834
Go!

15:36.917 --> 15:39.875
(gun firing)

15:40.667 --> 15:42.750
Come on, come on, get it!

15:42.834 --> 15:44.000
Get your hands up!

15:44.083 --> 15:45.667
(gun firing)

15:45.750 --> 15:48.583
(dramatic music)

15:49.500 --> 15:52.709
(body thudding)

15:52.792 --> 15:55.083
Come on, get up, get up!

15:55.166 --> 15:57.417
(crowd cheering)

15:57.500 --> 15:58.917
Come on, fight!

16:08.000 --> 16:10.709
(soft groaning)

16:11.792 --> 16:12.542
(blows thudding)

16:12.625 --> 16:13.000
Come on!

16:13.083 --> 16:15.583
(dramatic music)

16:15.667 --> 16:18.458
(crowd shouting)

16:19.458 --> 16:21.166
(somber music)

16:36.875 --> 16:37.834
- [Man] That's all right.

16:37.917 --> 16:40.125
That's how a champion wins!

16:50.041 --> 16:51.125
(gasps)

17:06.166 --> 17:06.917
- How is she?

17:07.000 --> 17:07.875
- Fine.

17:12.375 --> 17:13.083
- Zoey.

17:13.166 --> 17:14.166
- [Zoey] She got a lucky shot.

17:14.250 --> 17:17.041
- Look, we're gonna
take some time off.

17:17.125 --> 17:20.250
You got a 90 day suspension
from that knockout anyway.

17:20.333 --> 17:20.375
- 90 days?

17:27.208 --> 17:28.333
I'll see you at the gym.

17:34.000 --> 17:37.417
(gentle, peaceful music)

17:39.375 --> 17:41.583
- [Rogers] Juliana Delacroix,
this is Detective Rogers

17:41.667 --> 17:42.458
of the Calgary Police.

17:42.542 --> 17:45.250
Could you give me
a call right away?

17:45.333 --> 17:47.542
We have some very important
information for you

17:47.625 --> 17:50.166
concerning your father,
Javier Delacroix.

17:52.875 --> 17:55.291
He's passed away, I'm afraid.

17:56.709 --> 17:58.333
I'm sorry.

17:59.875 --> 18:02.583
(plane roaring)

18:15.333 --> 18:18.291
(car engine humming)

18:25.250 --> 18:28.125
(peaceful music)

18:49.417 --> 18:52.125
(door creaking)

19:34.834 --> 19:36.750
(door clanging)

19:36.834 --> 19:37.625
- Hey.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.917
Sorry, I didn't
mean to startle you.

19:40.000 --> 19:42.709
It's Juliana, right?

19:42.792 --> 19:44.542
- No one calls me that anymore.

19:44.625 --> 19:46.208
- Right, it's Zoey.

19:47.667 --> 19:49.041
- You must be Renee.

19:49.125 --> 19:52.500
My father told me
a lot about you.

19:52.583 --> 19:53.583
It's nice to finally meet you.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.458
- Likewise.

19:56.750 --> 19:57.375
Look, I'm so sorry.

20:00.291 --> 20:01.083
(door clanking)

20:01.166 --> 20:02.250
- Knock knock.

20:02.333 --> 20:03.500
Calgary Police.

20:04.000 --> 20:05.333
Juliana Delacroix?

20:06.917 --> 20:08.667
- I'm Zoey.

20:08.750 --> 20:09.291
I mean, Juliana.

20:11.458 --> 20:14.959
- Right, I'm Detective
Rogers, we spoke on the phone.

20:15.041 --> 20:17.959
Again, I'm sorry
about your father.

20:18.041 --> 20:20.166
I just wanted to come by

20:21.041 --> 20:24.959
and bring his
belongings personally.

20:25.041 --> 20:28.709
- [Renee] Hey, what's
going on with the case?

20:28.792 --> 20:30.709
- We're doing everything we can.

20:30.792 --> 20:31.208
- Mm.

20:31.291 --> 20:32.333
- Tell me this.

20:32.417 --> 20:35.500
How does somebody gun down
my father right outside

20:35.583 --> 20:38.625
of a crowded fight and
nobody sees anything?

20:38.709 --> 20:43.792
- Well, listen, your father
was in a dangerous business.

20:45.041 --> 20:47.333
One that likes to keep
its secrets secret.

20:50.750 --> 20:52.291
Here is my card.

20:53.750 --> 20:58.500
If you come up with anything
useful, give me a call.

20:58.583 --> 21:01.375
Otherwise, have a
good day, ladies.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.375
- Fuckers!

21:12.375 --> 21:14.375
You know they're not
gonna do a thing.

21:14.458 --> 21:17.542
They're probably
part of the cover up.

21:17.625 --> 21:18.166
- Cover up?

21:18.250 --> 21:20.166
Why would they do that?

21:20.250 --> 21:22.333
- Because money buys
things around here.

21:22.417 --> 21:23.542
Even the cops.

21:23.625 --> 21:25.583
Now if you want something done,

21:25.667 --> 21:28.166
you've gotta do it yourself.

21:28.250 --> 21:30.917
Let me help you with your bags.

21:31.000 --> 21:31.875
(singing in foreign language)

21:31.959 --> 21:34.500
(upbeat hip hop music)

21:52.333 --> 21:54.750
♪ What you looking at,
whatcha, whatcha looking at ♪

21:54.834 --> 21:57.750
♪ With your looking ass, with
your, with your looking ass ♪

21:57.834 --> 22:00.834
♪ What you looking at,

22:00.917 --> 22:02.709
♪ With your looking

22:02.792 --> 22:07.583
(groans)
(glass shattering)

22:09.500 --> 22:12.291
(wood clattering

22:12.834 --> 22:16.041
(grunting)

22:20.166 --> 22:22.250
- Natalia, Ivan's here.

22:24.166 --> 22:26.917
- Would you like me to join you?

22:27.000 --> 22:28.667
- No.

22:28.750 --> 22:29.709
I'll be fine.

22:33.959 --> 22:34.542
Clean up this mess.

22:38.208 --> 22:40.291
(sighs)

22:40.875 --> 22:42.917
Ivan.

22:43.000 --> 22:44.625
- Natalia!

22:44.709 --> 22:45.959
(laughs)

22:46.041 --> 22:47.458
How is my sister?

22:48.875 --> 22:50.500
- Fine.

23:00.333 --> 23:04.208
- (clears throat) There are
those at home who think you have

23:04.291 --> 23:07.250
perhaps let things slip
out of your control.

23:07.333 --> 23:09.291
- This is not true, I
have found the thieves.

23:09.375 --> 23:10.291
- Hmm, Petrov?

23:10.375 --> 23:11.458
- Yes.

23:11.542 --> 23:12.000
And his partners.

23:12.083 --> 23:14.291
- And the money?

23:14.375 --> 23:16.500
- I don't have it.

23:16.583 --> 23:18.750
Petrov would not confess.

23:18.834 --> 23:22.458
Our only hope to find our
money lies with this bookie.

23:22.542 --> 23:26.583
- (sighs) Petrov was a fool but
I did not think him a thief.

23:28.875 --> 23:31.333
Should not have taken his
life without permission.

23:31.417 --> 23:33.083
His father is
demanding retribution.

23:33.166 --> 23:36.375
- We caught him red-handed.

23:36.458 --> 23:38.083
So you tell Miloshivy that
his bastard son is a thief,

23:38.166 --> 23:41.041
and I have it under control.

23:41.125 --> 23:42.583
- Oh, I know.

23:42.667 --> 23:43.834
I know!

23:43.917 --> 23:46.166
Natalia! (chuckles)

23:46.250 --> 23:47.542
But there are others

23:47.625 --> 23:52.750
who would like it if someone
could check on things.

23:56.208 --> 23:58.542
- I will not have
a watchdog over me!

23:58.625 --> 24:02.667
(singing in foreign language)
(upbeat hip hop music)

24:04.709 --> 24:04.750
- Natalia.

24:06.417 --> 24:08.625
There is no choice for you.

24:12.583 --> 24:14.208
The money you lost.

24:15.542 --> 24:19.208
They ask you
replace it plus 80%.

24:19.291 --> 24:20.208
- 80?

24:22.625 --> 24:25.166
- Also you must pay Milosivik
two million to cover his loss.

24:25.250 --> 24:27.417
(Natalia laughs)

24:27.500 --> 24:29.458
- You must be kidding.

24:30.458 --> 24:33.542
His son is a snake,
he should pay me.

24:33.625 --> 24:36.709
- The other options are
less pleasant for you.

24:38.875 --> 24:41.000
- It will take time.

24:41.083 --> 24:46.125
- For your sake, Natalia,
the less time the better, hm?

24:46.208 --> 24:49.000
(sniffs) This looks marvelous.

24:49.083 --> 24:50.041
Let's eat!

24:54.625 --> 24:56.125
- I was just like you.

24:56.208 --> 24:57.500
So full of fire and anger.

24:57.583 --> 25:01.125
Just working my
way up the ladder.

25:01.208 --> 25:03.667
Until my knee got busted up.

25:03.750 --> 25:06.583
Took me out of
the game for good.

25:06.667 --> 25:09.542
Javier gave me a second chance.

25:09.625 --> 25:10.542
He put me to work when I was

25:10.625 --> 25:13.792
down on everything and everyone.

25:13.875 --> 25:15.542
- You didn't know
my dad like I did.

25:15.625 --> 25:18.458
- I know he followed
you in Vegas.

25:18.542 --> 25:19.959
And I know he was proud.

25:20.041 --> 25:22.417
- Bullshit.

25:22.500 --> 25:24.500
- Did he ever tell you about
the instructional videos?

25:24.583 --> 25:25.333
- No.

25:25.417 --> 25:27.500
What instructional videos?

25:27.583 --> 25:30.333
- If you get a chance,
if you can find his iPad,

25:30.417 --> 25:31.917
you've got to check it out.

25:32.000 --> 25:33.750
He was making a whole series.

25:33.834 --> 25:34.917
He wanted to teach the world

25:35.000 --> 25:38.208
about self-discipline
and inner peace.

25:38.291 --> 25:40.208
- More of his hippie zen crap.

25:40.291 --> 25:41.709
- It was more like a mix between

25:41.792 --> 25:43.542
like Tai Chi and meditation.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.959
- I got so sick of him
pushing that shit on me.

25:46.041 --> 25:47.041
(knocking)

25:47.125 --> 25:49.208
- Anyone here?

25:50.542 --> 25:51.834
- Hey.

25:51.917 --> 25:51.959
- Oh.

25:53.583 --> 25:57.333
I am looking for
Javier Delacroix.

25:58.417 --> 25:58.834
- He passed on.

26:01.000 --> 26:01.834
- I'm sorry.

26:03.083 --> 26:06.792
(sighs) I have this
for his next of kin.

26:09.000 --> 26:12.792
Javier was six months
behind on two mortgages.

26:14.333 --> 26:18.417
This is the 30 day notice
of eviction of the gym.

26:21.208 --> 26:23.500
- I'll let them know.

26:23.583 --> 26:25.000
- I'm very sorry.

26:29.417 --> 26:30.834
- God, I knew we
were behind on rent,

26:30.917 --> 26:32.417
but I had no idea!

26:34.458 --> 26:35.083
- [Zoey] I can't pay that.

26:35.166 --> 26:36.875
- Howdy.

26:36.959 --> 26:39.250
Sorry to bother y'all.

26:39.333 --> 26:40.667
- [Renee] What are
you doing here?

26:40.750 --> 26:43.166
- Well I'm just here
to pay my condolences.

26:43.250 --> 26:44.417
- That's some bullshit.

26:44.500 --> 26:47.750
(clears throat)

26:47.834 --> 26:47.875
- Well.

26:50.834 --> 26:53.583
Hi, I'm Jones, I'm
a fight promoter.

26:53.667 --> 26:55.083
You must be Zoey.

26:55.166 --> 26:56.166
- Hi.

26:56.250 --> 26:57.500
- Honey don't let him swoon you.

26:57.583 --> 26:59.542
Jones straight from Texas.

26:59.625 --> 27:02.166
A real snake in the grass.

27:02.250 --> 27:04.625
- I'm just a businessman.

27:04.709 --> 27:07.709
Look, if you're serious
about keeping this gym open,

27:07.792 --> 27:10.041
you might need someone like me.

27:10.125 --> 27:11.709
- What do you propose?

27:11.792 --> 27:12.959
- Well, I have fighters who
are looking for trainers.

27:13.041 --> 27:17.959
Much as you like to bust my
balls, you are the best in town.

27:18.041 --> 27:20.750
So I say we partner up 50 50.

27:20.834 --> 27:23.041
I bring my fighters
here to train,

27:23.125 --> 27:25.208
and we promote fights together.

27:25.291 --> 27:26.458
We split the profits.

27:26.542 --> 27:29.417
- I've got my own
career in Vegas.

27:29.500 --> 27:31.208
- That's right, I heard.

27:31.291 --> 27:33.709
Sorry about the knockout.

27:33.792 --> 27:35.542
Look I'd really hate to see
all of your father's hard work

27:35.625 --> 27:38.375
go up in smoke at
a bank auction.

27:38.458 --> 27:41.500
So you should think about it.

27:41.583 --> 27:43.291
- Have a good night.

27:44.875 --> 27:47.333
- She said have a good night.

27:49.667 --> 27:53.417
- I'll tell you what. (sighs)

27:53.500 --> 27:57.917
If you change your mind, why
don't you give me a call.

28:03.667 --> 28:06.083
- It's too bad that he's right.

28:06.166 --> 28:06.750
- About what?

28:06.834 --> 28:10.333
- Javier loved this place.

28:10.417 --> 28:13.041
It would be a
shame to see it go.

28:15.291 --> 28:16.583
- [Zoey] Thanks
for the tea, Renee.

28:16.667 --> 28:17.875
- [Renee] Oh, it's no problem.

28:17.959 --> 28:19.625
- That was really nice of you.

28:19.709 --> 28:20.750
- No problem.

28:20.834 --> 28:22.333
Look, the funeral's
at nine, okay?

28:22.417 --> 28:23.208
So I'll be here in the morning?

28:23.291 --> 28:25.083
- Okay.

28:25.166 --> 28:26.250
- You okay?
- Yeah.

28:26.333 --> 28:27.417
- Alright, call me
if you need anything.

28:27.500 --> 28:28.250
- I will.
- All right.

28:28.333 --> 28:31.083
(phone ringing)

28:34.417 --> 28:36.166
- Uncle Ray.

28:36.250 --> 28:36.625
- [Ray] Hey, Zoey.

28:36.709 --> 28:38.125
How ya doin?

28:39.542 --> 28:40.875
- The funeral's tomorrow.

28:40.959 --> 28:42.792
- [Ray] I'm so, so sorry.

28:42.875 --> 28:45.375
They're finally together, so.

28:46.709 --> 28:48.667
He and your mom.

28:48.750 --> 28:50.291
The best way to heal is

28:50.375 --> 28:51.917
to focus on yourself.

28:52.875 --> 28:54.041
So take some time, okay?

28:56.417 --> 28:56.959
Don't rush back.

28:59.625 --> 29:00.625
- Okay.

29:00.709 --> 29:02.208
Thanks, Uncle Ray.

29:03.208 --> 29:05.792
(solemn music)

29:14.000 --> 29:14.750
- Zoey, I know you taught me how

29:14.834 --> 29:17.709
to use this thing
about a year ago,

29:17.792 --> 29:21.500
but you know I'm as good with
this tech stuff as a caveman.

29:21.583 --> 29:23.500
But hey, not bad, huh?

29:26.375 --> 29:29.417
Renee said I should
talk to you more.

29:30.625 --> 29:33.041
But you don't return
my calls, not so much.

29:35.250 --> 29:38.625
So I thought I'd do some
videos and send them to you.

29:38.709 --> 29:39.583
Sometime.

29:40.583 --> 29:41.917
Zoey, without your mother,

29:44.583 --> 29:48.375
there was always something
missing between us.

29:49.583 --> 29:52.875
Something I could
never get quite right.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.166
You remember the
first time you tried

29:54.250 --> 29:56.125
to ride your motorcycle?

29:57.041 --> 30:00.125
You were so determined
to do it right.

30:02.000 --> 30:04.542
You went down that
hill so fast, too fast.

30:04.625 --> 30:05.875
I went running after
you and I tripped.

30:05.959 --> 30:08.542
I'm the one that ended
up with bruises and cuts

30:08.625 --> 30:11.041
and you just rode it to a stop.

30:25.709 --> 30:29.291
Your mother would have
been so proud of you.

30:31.458 --> 30:33.542
You're a gift.

30:37.041 --> 30:39.375
You can accomplish anything.

30:45.333 --> 30:49.000
(chuckles) You never give up.

30:51.917 --> 30:55.667
I know you don't want
to fight for me anymore,

30:55.750 --> 30:59.375
but I'm always gonna be
there in your corner.

31:01.500 --> 31:03.417
Every day is a battle.

31:05.709 --> 31:09.000
We might not fight with
these, but we do with this.

31:11.041 --> 31:14.750
You can bring any of your
opponents to their knees

31:14.834 --> 31:17.500
with your mind and your spirit.

31:25.709 --> 31:28.166
You are a rare soul.

31:32.625 --> 31:34.333
You always have been

31:36.000 --> 31:38.208
my Golden Dragon.

31:38.291 --> 31:40.125
(sighs)

31:46.333 --> 31:49.959
(motorcyle engine revving)

32:04.667 --> 32:08.166
(gentle orchestral music)

32:25.625 --> 32:29.417
(crowd whispering)

32:41.917 --> 32:44.917
(crowd chattering)

32:49.375 --> 32:53.208
- I've never seen so many of
his fighters in one place.

32:53.291 --> 32:55.709
He was really loved
in this community.

32:55.792 --> 32:58.667
And he loved this place.

33:00.625 --> 33:02.458
- I'm gonna stay.

33:02.542 --> 33:04.041
And keep it open.

33:04.125 --> 33:06.333
- It's six months
behind on the mortgage.

33:06.417 --> 33:08.333
How are you gonna handle that?

33:08.417 --> 33:09.792
- I have to.

33:09.875 --> 33:12.291
- You have something
real in Vegas.

33:12.375 --> 33:14.125
And you're gonna blow
it on this place?

33:14.208 --> 33:15.834
- No, I'm gonna put it on hold

33:15.917 --> 33:18.542
to avenge my father's death.

33:18.625 --> 33:19.583
He would do the same for me.

33:19.667 --> 33:21.750
- That's a bad idea.

33:21.834 --> 33:22.875
- You and that
cop both said that

33:23.000 --> 33:25.542
it's the fighting
world that got him.

33:25.625 --> 33:27.875
And I'm gonna get them back.

33:27.959 --> 33:29.750
Are you gonna help me or not?

33:29.834 --> 33:31.417
- I need to show
you something first.

33:31.500 --> 33:31.917
(upbeat electronic music)

33:32.000 --> 33:33.834

33:53.333 --> 33:57.083
- This is one of the many popup
venues for street fighting.

33:57.166 --> 33:59.792
There's no paramedics,
there's no stadium,

33:59.875 --> 34:02.083
and there's no backup.

34:02.166 --> 34:05.000
It's just you in
that ring, all alone.

34:07.125 --> 34:08.000

34:10.000 --> 34:12.750
- Shit, I heard he was back.

34:12.834 --> 34:13.917
- Who?

34:14.000 --> 34:15.458
- Feodor.

34:15.542 --> 34:18.333
He's a real Scottish bastard.

34:18.417 --> 34:20.625
Shit, come on, let's go.

34:20.709 --> 34:23.542
(crowd cheering)

34:33.542 --> 34:35.291
- [Feodor] Renee
The Blade Hansen.

34:35.375 --> 34:37.500
- Feodor.

34:37.500 --> 34:39.333
Hasn't been long enough.

34:39.417 --> 34:40.458
(laughs)

34:40.542 --> 34:43.667
- Oh these American
jokes, very good.

34:43.750 --> 34:46.000
Listen I am sorry to
hear about Javier.

34:46.083 --> 34:48.792
Respectable man, what a shame.

34:48.875 --> 34:49.834
And it also saddens me

34:49.917 --> 34:52.500
to hear about Smash Gym.

34:52.583 --> 34:53.417
But if you are looking

34:53.500 --> 34:55.291
for a new gym to train in,

34:55.375 --> 34:56.625
I can recommend you one.

34:56.709 --> 34:59.083
- Sounds like you got
some bad information.

34:59.166 --> 35:00.792
We're still open for business.

35:00.875 --> 35:02.959
- So who's this young lass.

35:03.041 --> 35:04.417
- Zoey Delacroix.

35:05.792 --> 35:08.250
- Javier's daughter?

35:09.166 --> 35:10.917
It is Javier's daughter.

35:11.000 --> 35:12.667
The Golden Dragon, what brings

35:12.750 --> 35:14.959
you back from Las Vegas?

35:15.041 --> 35:17.709
- I'm looking for a fight.

35:17.792 --> 35:19.250
You know of any?

35:19.333 --> 35:20.500
- See, I like you.

35:20.583 --> 35:22.500
I like you a lot.

35:22.583 --> 35:25.875
But what I dabble in isn't that
semi-professional bullshit.

35:25.959 --> 35:28.417
This is street fighting.

35:28.500 --> 35:29.291
(crowd cheering)

35:29.375 --> 35:32.875
(intense electronic music)

35:37.625 --> 35:39.250
Now!

35:42.667 --> 35:45.458
(crowd shouting)

35:56.500 --> 35:58.291
(crowd cheering)

35:58.375 --> 36:00.959
(bone popping)

36:02.333 --> 36:05.041
(bone crunching

36:10.417 --> 36:15.375
- Prove yourself first
and then just maybe

36:15.458 --> 36:17.083
I'll give you a shot.

36:17.166 --> 36:18.959
- Whatever, let's go.

36:27.083 --> 36:28.625
- [Zoey] I think he liked me.

36:28.709 --> 36:30.500
- He's dangerous.

36:30.583 --> 36:32.166
- Well, well, well.

36:33.917 --> 36:35.583
That looks like you
changed your mind.

36:35.667 --> 36:37.792
- About your status
as an asshole?

36:37.875 --> 36:38.834
- You know after our call

36:38.917 --> 36:40.917
I thought we were good.

36:41.000 --> 36:44.083
Looks like Feodor's moving in.

36:44.166 --> 36:45.417
- You and I are still good.

36:45.500 --> 36:47.750
You save the gym and
I'll fight for you.

36:47.834 --> 36:49.250
- You made a deal with him?

36:49.333 --> 36:51.291
- Look I'm gonna do this
with or without you.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.166
- Dammit, Zoey, you're
fucking up my life.

36:53.250 --> 36:54.667
- I'd rather it be with you.

36:54.750 --> 36:55.208
- Fuck.

36:55.291 --> 36:56.500
- So you'll do it?

36:58.208 --> 36:59.959
- Yeah, but you remember this.

37:00.041 --> 37:00.959
You came to me.

37:01.041 --> 37:04.166
You do what I say, when
I say it, or I walk.

37:04.250 --> 37:06.208
And no attitude.

37:06.291 --> 37:07.625
And you.

37:07.709 --> 37:09.333
No middle of nowhere
shit hole fights.

37:09.417 --> 37:13.959
I want the stuff in
the city that counts.

37:14.041 --> 37:16.917
- And I want to
fight the Russians.

37:18.375 --> 37:19.917
- Tell you what.

37:20.000 --> 37:20.959
You win your fights,

37:21.041 --> 37:24.083
you'll get the Russians.

37:24.166 --> 37:25.041
- Okay.

37:26.333 --> 37:27.208
- Okay.

37:28.000 --> 37:30.125
Looks like we're a team.

37:33.417 --> 37:35.709
(suspenseful music)

37:35.792 --> 37:36.500
- Come on, give it to me.

37:36.583 --> 37:37.375
One, two, let's go.

37:37.458 --> 37:38.500
Nice, go.

37:38.583 --> 37:39.917
One, two, good.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.834
Again, again.

37:41.917 --> 37:45.041
There's no cage around that
ring so you've got to stay in.

37:45.125 --> 37:47.166
Look, you fall out three
times and it's over.

37:47.250 --> 37:49.208
Get back up, let's go.

37:50.959 --> 37:51.667
That's nice, good job.

37:51.750 --> 37:54.166
(grunting)

37:54.250 --> 37:54.750
Come on, Zoey, let's go.

37:54.834 --> 37:57.000
(grunting)

37:57.083 --> 37:58.208
- Fuck!

37:58.291 --> 38:01.125
(chair thudding)

38:02.291 --> 38:04.625
- Zoey, Zoey, what's
up, what's going on?

38:04.709 --> 38:06.166
- I can't find my dad's watch.

38:06.250 --> 38:07.333
- What?

38:07.417 --> 38:08.250
- The one that I gave him.

38:08.333 --> 38:09.583
I thought it would be in here,

38:09.667 --> 38:10.834
But I can't find it anywhere.

38:10.917 --> 38:12.000
- Zoey, just relax,

38:12.083 --> 38:12.959
calm down, we'll find it.

38:13.041 --> 38:16.917
- No, Renee, just
find me another fight.

38:17.000 --> 38:18.041
- Zoey, watch her left.

38:18.125 --> 38:19.291
(screams)

38:19.375 --> 38:20.250
Come on.

38:21.625 --> 38:22.000
- Come at me, fucker!

38:22.083 --> 38:24.083
- Hey, hey!

38:24.166 --> 38:24.875
Hold on!

38:24.959 --> 38:25.458
Zoey, come here.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.000
What's going on?

38:29.083 --> 38:30.458
- With what?

38:30.542 --> 38:31.917
- Look, you're like a bag
of jumping beans in there.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.542
You've gotta stay calm.

38:34.625 --> 38:35.125
- I'm fine, I have this.

38:35.208 --> 38:37.417
- No, you ain't fine.

38:37.500 --> 38:39.166
You've got talent
but it's wasted

38:39.250 --> 38:41.417
when all that anger
gets in the way.

38:41.500 --> 38:43.500
Just stay calm, okay, let's go.

38:43.583 --> 38:45.458
Let's get back in there.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.375
You're gonna face every
style of fighting.

38:49.458 --> 38:53.083
So you got some real
tough bitches out there.

38:53.166 --> 38:56.542
And there's gonna throw
everything they've got at you.

38:56.625 --> 38:59.083
You just gotta be ready.

38:59.166 --> 39:01.750
Throw her out, step around.

39:01.834 --> 39:02.750
Don't sit there.

39:02.834 --> 39:03.083
Good.

39:03.166 --> 39:04.500
(grunts)

39:04.583 --> 39:05.709
Nice, good job.

39:06.667 --> 39:07.083
Zoey, good.

39:07.166 --> 39:08.959
Good defense.

39:10.000 --> 39:11.875
Nice, yes, good job.

39:11.959 --> 39:13.583
Oh, nice!

39:14.709 --> 39:15.417
Yes, baby girl.

39:15.500 --> 39:17.583
Nice defense, good.

39:17.667 --> 39:18.667
Yes.

39:18.750 --> 39:19.542
Finish.

39:19.625 --> 39:20.917
Nice, yes.

39:21.000 --> 39:22.375
That's what I'm talking about.

39:22.458 --> 39:23.000
(cheering)

39:23.083 --> 39:26.625
(hands clapping)

39:27.709 --> 39:30.083
- I just heard from Drifter.

39:30.166 --> 39:31.583
We're all set for Friday.

39:31.667 --> 39:33.792
- You got her her first
fight with The Unforgiven?

39:33.875 --> 39:35.959
They're gonna kill her
before we even get started.

39:36.041 --> 39:38.458
- Well then I suggest
you all get back to work.

39:38.542 --> 39:41.291
- When are you gonna
pay that mortgage?

39:41.375 --> 39:44.291
- Well why don't you let me
see you win your first fight?

39:44.375 --> 39:45.583
- Get back to work.

39:45.667 --> 39:47.083

41:44.834 --> 41:49.291
These fuckin' yahoos, (sighs)
they got her fighting Harley.

41:49.375 --> 41:50.250
- What?

41:50.333 --> 41:51.709
No, the deal was Myra!

41:51.792 --> 41:53.625
- Yeah, I know, they
said that Myra was sick.

41:53.709 --> 41:55.083
- How come every time
you set up a fight,

41:55.166 --> 41:57.041
something's fucked?

41:57.125 --> 41:58.750
- Renee, this isn't my fault!

41:58.834 --> 41:59.750
- She can't fight her.

42:01.542 --> 42:03.709
- Then we're done.

42:03.792 --> 42:04.875
I told you.

42:04.959 --> 42:06.750
If I lose money, this is over.

42:06.834 --> 42:09.583
- I knew I should have
never trusted you.

42:09.667 --> 42:10.834
- Hey, guys, I got this.

42:12.500 --> 42:15.208
(soaring orchestral music)

42:15.291 --> 42:16.375
- All right.

42:18.000 --> 42:19.750
Follow me.

42:21.250 --> 42:24.792
(crowd shouting)

42:27.417 --> 42:28.542
(fire crackling)

42:28.625 --> 42:30.625
- Remember what I told you
about these biker bitches, okay?

42:30.709 --> 42:33.125
They go for the eyes, got it?

42:38.542 --> 42:39.083
- [Jones] (sighs) She ready?

42:39.166 --> 42:39.917
- All right.

42:40.000 --> 42:41.709
Ready?

42:41.792 --> 42:41.834
Let's go.

42:44.166 --> 42:45.458
- [Man] Come on, boo!

42:45.542 --> 42:46.208
Come on, come on!

42:46.291 --> 42:49.750
(crowd jeering)

42:52.375 --> 42:53.750
- [Man] You can't
fight here, come on!

42:53.834 --> 42:55.375
- [Man] You have no idea
what you're getting into!

42:55.458 --> 42:57.959
- [Man] Bring out Harley!

42:58.041 --> 42:58.875
Go on!

42:59.875 --> 43:02.041
Go on, get up there, girl!

43:02.125 --> 43:04.625
Here we go, little white girl!

43:06.250 --> 43:08.375
- [Crowd] Harley,
Harley, Harley!

43:08.458 --> 43:10.792
Harley, Harley, Harley!
- Yeah!

43:12.041 --> 43:16.959
(crowd cheering)
(metal rattling)

43:18.542 --> 43:21.250
(intense music)

43:22.041 --> 43:24.959
- [Crowd] Harley,
Harley, Harley!

43:25.041 --> 43:27.667
Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley!

43:27.750 --> 43:30.417
Harley, Harley, Harley, Harley!

43:31.291 --> 43:33.917
- The rules are
there are no rules.

43:34.000 --> 43:36.834
Tap out or be knocked
out, now step back.

43:36.917 --> 43:38.333
You ready?
- You got this!

43:38.417 --> 43:39.583
- You ready?

43:39.667 --> 43:40.542
Fight.

43:41.333 --> 43:44.166
(crowd shouting)

43:44.583 --> 43:47.291
(grunting)

43:48.208 --> 43:51.750
(blows thudding)

43:53.250 --> 43:55.959
(crowd yelling)

44:07.458 --> 44:08.333
- Come on!

44:10.125 --> 44:13.333
(grunting)

44:44.333 --> 44:45.250
- Give up!

44:45.333 --> 44:46.375
- Fuck you.

44:46.458 --> 44:47.625
- Give up or I break your arm!

44:47.709 --> 44:49.375
- Go to fucking hell.

44:49.458 --> 44:51.917
(screaming)

44:52.000 --> 44:52.333
(bone snaps)

44:52.417 --> 44:55.291
(cheering)

44:55.375 --> 44:56.250
- (laughs) Yes!

44:56.333 --> 44:58.333
Way to go baby.

44:58.417 --> 45:01.583
(crowd shouting)

45:01.667 --> 45:01.834
Woo, awesome.

45:04.917 --> 45:05.166
(laughs)

45:05.250 --> 45:06.166
Nice.

45:06.250 --> 45:07.083
(crowd jeering)

45:07.166 --> 45:08.875
(laughs)

45:08.959 --> 45:09.959
Jones!

45:10.041 --> 45:10.083
- Yeah!

45:11.667 --> 45:12.583
Whoo!

45:13.667 --> 45:16.417
The winner is the Golden Dragon!

45:17.291 --> 45:18.166
Whoo!

45:18.500 --> 45:19.959
Yeah!

45:21.250 --> 45:24.083
- All right, nice, good job.

45:24.166 --> 45:25.834
Come on.

45:25.917 --> 45:28.625
(crowd jeering)

45:30.250 --> 45:31.875
Nice doin' business
with you, gentlemen.

45:31.959 --> 45:32.000
Let's go.

45:33.333 --> 45:35.959
Yeah, yeah, right.

45:36.041 --> 45:37.834
(dramatic music)

45:42.709 --> 45:45.166
- [Tatiana] Making breakfast.

45:48.291 --> 45:51.000
(paper ripping)

45:52.792 --> 45:54.208
- Give me minute.

46:04.333 --> 46:06.500
(paper rustling)

46:06.583 --> 46:07.250
What are you doing here?

46:07.333 --> 46:09.500
- Good morning.

46:20.792 --> 46:22.917
Oh, I have spent all night

46:26.417 --> 46:29.125
reading fucking files!

46:30.542 --> 46:33.208
And I've find nothing.

46:34.208 --> 46:35.917
- And what are you looking for?

46:38.625 --> 46:42.166
- Do you remember
the Russian story

46:42.250 --> 46:45.542
about the little
field mouse, the hawk?

46:48.750 --> 46:51.583
Well, all the filed
mouse's friends

46:52.625 --> 46:55.709
left her in this field

46:55.792 --> 46:58.250
while they hid in the forest.

46:59.750 --> 47:01.667
Now in come the hawks,

47:02.583 --> 47:04.125
expecting a feast of course,

47:04.208 --> 47:09.041
but all they could find was
this little, small field mouse.

47:12.542 --> 47:13.917
So they took her!

47:19.500 --> 47:20.750
- You forget the ending.

47:20.834 --> 47:23.750
The mouse made a
deal with the hawks

47:23.834 --> 47:26.917
to tell them where
her friends hid.

47:27.000 --> 47:30.291
They all died while
the mouse got away.

47:32.125 --> 47:32.959
- Very good.

47:34.750 --> 47:35.625
Very good.

47:40.333 --> 47:42.208
Ivan called.

47:45.166 --> 47:46.959
And he wants his money.

47:48.166 --> 47:49.000
Where is it?

47:50.500 --> 47:55.250
- I am promoting
a street fighting
championship next month.

47:56.166 --> 47:57.333
It will generate enough money

47:57.417 --> 48:00.208
to pay back my
debt with interest.

48:01.375 --> 48:06.500
When it is paid, you are to
leave and never come back.

48:13.792 --> 48:16.542
- [Tatiana] Natalia,
are you okay?

48:28.625 --> 48:30.125
- I will miss you.

48:37.959 --> 48:40.500
(tense music)

48:45.583 --> 48:47.750
(sniffs)

48:58.667 --> 49:01.583
(crows squawking)

49:01.667 --> 49:02.667
(dog barking)

49:02.750 --> 49:05.250
- [Paula] You should be
cleaning this place out.

49:05.333 --> 49:08.333
- Listen, I just
need some more time.

49:08.417 --> 49:10.625
- Six months is a long time.

49:10.709 --> 49:12.250
We cannot give you any more.

49:12.333 --> 49:14.166
- And I appreciate that, I just,

49:14.250 --> 49:16.375
if you could just give
me two weeks, okay?

49:16.458 --> 49:18.291
Two weeks is all I ask.

49:20.667 --> 49:22.375
- I'll recommend
two weeks extension,

49:22.458 --> 49:24.458
but that's all I can give.

49:24.542 --> 49:27.500
- Well I appreciate
that, thank you.

49:30.834 --> 49:31.959
(sighs)

49:32.041 --> 49:34.875
Zoey, we're gonna
have to fast track

49:34.959 --> 49:36.041
because we need cash.

49:36.125 --> 49:38.959
She will shut you
down in two weeks.

49:39.041 --> 49:40.959
- Just set up a fight.

49:41.041 --> 49:45.250
(train whistling)
(train chugging)

49:46.625 --> 49:49.125
(crowd cheering)

49:50.333 --> 49:53.083
(intense heavy metal music)

50:03.000 --> 50:05.333
- Yes, that's it, that's it!

50:07.041 --> 50:11.875
(singing drowned out
by crowd cheering)

50:20.333 --> 50:22.917
(spit hissing)

50:31.458 --> 50:33.583
(grunting)

50:39.041 --> 50:41.041
- She's not in the game.

50:41.125 --> 50:43.083
- Come on now, you can't
hurt her by striking.

50:43.166 --> 50:44.291
You've gotta submit her.

50:52.667 --> 50:55.041
(grunting)

51:01.792 --> 51:02.625
Come on!

51:02.709 --> 51:05.083
(grunting)

51:24.000 --> 51:28.250
(bone popping)
(crowd shouting)

51:28.333 --> 51:31.875
(somber orchestral music)

51:51.000 --> 51:53.792
(crowd cheering)

51:54.875 --> 51:56.667
- [Referee] Okay, that's
it, step back, step back.

51:56.750 --> 51:58.625
Step back.

51:58.709 --> 51:59.333
That's it, fight's over.

51:59.417 --> 52:00.667
- That's what I'm talking about.

52:00.750 --> 52:02.041
- Yes, yes!

52:02.125 --> 52:03.500
- I'm gonna go get my money.

52:03.583 --> 52:04.875
- All right.

52:04.959 --> 52:07.000
- [Crowd] Dragon,
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

52:07.083 --> 52:10.709
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

52:10.792 --> 52:12.417
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

52:14.125 --> 52:16.834
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

52:17.959 --> 52:20.375
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

52:21.625 --> 52:23.291
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

52:25.166 --> 52:28.041
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

52:28.125 --> 52:32.291
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

52:32.375 --> 52:35.041
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

52:39.959 --> 52:42.250
- Now this is what
I'm talkin' about.

52:42.333 --> 52:44.000
- Yeah, we pay the mortgage.

52:44.083 --> 52:47.792
- Yeah, yeah, I'll call
Paula in the morning.

52:52.083 --> 52:55.709
- Man, that dude creeps me out.

52:55.792 --> 52:58.750
- Looks like you
got yourself a fan.

52:58.834 --> 53:00.125
- Yeah, maybe.

53:01.917 --> 53:05.709
- All right, let's go
grab a drink, I'm buying.

53:10.667 --> 53:12.917
- [Renee] Come on woman,
let's go. (laughs)

53:13.000 --> 53:16.542
- This is all they had.

53:16.625 --> 53:17.959
It's the cheap stuff.

53:18.041 --> 53:20.750
- Woo hoo. (laughing)

53:20.834 --> 53:22.875
- Look at her.

53:24.333 --> 53:26.959
She's trying to get back
in my good graces. (laughs)

53:27.041 --> 53:30.542
They didn't pay her
for throwing the fight.

53:31.875 --> 53:33.542
Life is a bitch.

53:33.625 --> 53:38.083
- Yeah, my mom used to make
me stand in the corner.

53:38.166 --> 53:38.542
I hated it.

53:38.625 --> 53:39.500
So much.

53:42.875 --> 53:44.500
Olivia.

53:44.583 --> 53:45.750
That was her name.

53:45.834 --> 53:50.083
After the accident, my dad
blamed himself for all of it.

53:50.166 --> 53:52.834
I tried so hard
to make him happy,

53:52.917 --> 53:55.041
but he never listened.

53:55.125 --> 53:57.000
- Girl, you've got
a rage inside you

53:57.083 --> 53:59.083
and it's just, it's
holding you back.

53:59.166 --> 54:01.959
You know, like
you're stuck, Zoey.

54:02.041 --> 54:05.208
Sometimes you've just
got to take a step back

54:05.291 --> 54:06.333
so you can move forward.

54:09.208 --> 54:12.458
- So do you think I
can come back now?

54:12.542 --> 54:13.417
- What do you want?

54:13.500 --> 54:14.041
- I'm sorry, Renee.

54:14.125 --> 54:15.959
I just want to fight.

54:16.041 --> 54:18.667
I messed up, I know.

54:18.750 --> 54:19.125
I'm sorry.

54:19.208 --> 54:20.583
- You blew it.

54:20.667 --> 54:21.542
Get out.

54:29.667 --> 54:31.583
(laughs)

54:31.667 --> 54:32.542
Hey.

54:34.458 --> 54:36.834
Be at the gym
tomorrow at six a.m.

54:36.917 --> 54:40.792
And you're gonna start
by cleaning the toilets.

54:41.250 --> 54:44.291
(snickering)

54:44.375 --> 54:45.667
- And you say I
have anger issues?

54:45.750 --> 54:47.291
(laughing)

54:47.375 --> 54:51.583
(glasses clinking)
(thunder roaring)

55:00.083 --> 55:00.917
Hey.

55:03.166 --> 55:04.041
- Well.

55:07.041 --> 55:08.291
Hello my ladies.

55:08.375 --> 55:09.750
- Look, we're working here.

55:09.834 --> 55:11.917
If you've got nothing better
to do, get the fuck out.

55:12.000 --> 55:13.250
- Whoa.

55:13.333 --> 55:14.542
Well the anger.

55:16.041 --> 55:17.875
After all I did just book
Zoey another fight tonight.

55:17.959 --> 55:20.875
(upbeat dance music)

55:20.959 --> 55:21.834
- Nice.

55:23.291 --> 55:24.583
- Oh now you're happy.

55:24.667 --> 55:26.458
- (laughs) Nice.

55:34.041 --> 55:35.792
(crowd chattering)

55:35.875 --> 55:39.500
(crowd cheering)

55:58.166 --> 56:00.041
- She's a tough motherfucker.

56:00.125 --> 56:01.417
- That don't mean a thing, okay?

56:01.500 --> 56:03.583
You just keep your chin down.

56:03.667 --> 56:04.875
You should be looking for
that easy knockout all night.

56:04.959 --> 56:07.000
You've got this.

56:07.083 --> 56:11.083
- It looks like you've
got someone's attention.

56:11.166 --> 56:12.834
- [Zoey] Good.

56:12.917 --> 56:15.875
- They're scouting for an
invitation-only street fight.

56:15.959 --> 56:18.125
Now this is your chance,
kid, don't fuck it up.

56:18.208 --> 56:20.083
- But don't worry about
that shit right now, okay?

56:20.166 --> 56:22.458
You go out there, and you
handle your fucking business.

56:22.542 --> 56:23.500
- Got this.

56:23.583 --> 56:25.500
- [Renee] Go get em, go.

56:26.709 --> 56:28.834
(intense music)

56:28.917 --> 56:31.667
- [Referee] Ready, fight.

56:31.750 --> 56:33.959
(grunts)

56:34.041 --> 56:36.792
(crowd cheering)

56:47.000 --> 56:47.875
- Get up.

56:49.208 --> 56:49.875
Get up, now.

56:49.959 --> 56:52.041
Do it, get up!

56:54.166 --> 56:55.583
(grunting)

57:05.291 --> 57:06.458
- Yes Dragon!

57:26.083 --> 57:28.709
(bone popping)

57:31.000 --> 57:32.875
- Break my arm.

57:32.959 --> 57:34.291
- What?

57:34.375 --> 57:36.500
- Break my arm or
they kill my family.

57:36.583 --> 57:37.166
Break my fucking arm.

57:37.250 --> 57:39.458
(screams)
(bone snaps)

57:39.542 --> 57:40.709
(crying)

57:44.625 --> 57:47.250
(solemn music)

58:17.667 --> 58:20.458
(crowd cheering)

58:26.834 --> 58:29.500
(slow clapping)

58:30.375 --> 58:32.333
- Very good, Golden Dragon.

58:32.417 --> 58:33.542
- What do you want?

58:33.625 --> 58:35.959
- I think it's time we
threw the dog a bone.

58:36.041 --> 58:39.083
Private invite only tournament.

58:39.166 --> 58:40.333
- I'm in.

58:40.417 --> 58:42.000
- Very good.

58:42.083 --> 58:44.625
I'll be, how do you
say, rooting for you.

58:46.166 --> 58:48.875
You and I, let's talk.

58:50.917 --> 58:55.417
- (sighs) It was
a hell of a fight.

58:57.083 --> 58:59.750
(intense electronic music)

59:12.208 --> 59:15.000
(crowd cheering)

1:00:00.542 --> 1:00:03.834
- [Crowd] Dragon,
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

1:00:15.333 --> 1:00:18.875
(engine revving)

1:00:27.458 --> 1:00:30.291
(crowd shouting)

1:00:37.834 --> 1:00:38.542
- Hey, you're late.

1:00:38.625 --> 1:00:40.208
Come on, let's go.

1:00:40.291 --> 1:00:41.083
- Whatever.

1:00:41.166 --> 1:00:44.166
- Yeah, it's not
whatever, let's go.

1:00:49.458 --> 1:00:53.458
(uplifting orchestral music)

1:00:53.542 --> 1:00:54.625
- Uncle Ray.

1:00:54.709 --> 1:00:57.250
- This place is
kinda hard to find.

1:00:59.709 --> 1:01:02.000
- Zoey, you're up, let's go.

1:01:06.500 --> 1:01:08.041
- [Referee] You ready?

1:01:08.125 --> 1:01:09.750
You ready?

1:01:10.875 --> 1:01:11.625
Let's do this.

1:01:11.709 --> 1:01:14.417
(intense music)

1:01:16.250 --> 1:01:19.166
(grunts)

1:01:19.250 --> 1:01:21.083
- Break your leg just like
I did your little friend's.

1:01:21.166 --> 1:01:24.458
- [Renee] Keep it
tight, keep it tight.

1:01:26.500 --> 1:01:27.959
(grunting)

1:01:33.750 --> 1:01:37.250
- [Everest] You've
got nothing on me.

1:01:37.333 --> 1:01:39.750
(grunting)

1:01:41.375 --> 1:01:44.417
(glass shattering)

1:01:45.959 --> 1:01:47.458
- You cocky bitch.

1:01:48.417 --> 1:01:50.792
(crowd cheering)

1:01:50.875 --> 1:01:52.208
- Woo, (laughs) way to go.

1:01:52.291 --> 1:01:54.667
Nice, nice, nice.

1:01:59.083 --> 1:02:00.667
- Get off me, get off me.

1:02:00.750 --> 1:02:02.125
I got this bitch.

1:02:04.417 --> 1:02:07.041
- [Man] Get your
head in the game!

1:02:09.041 --> 1:02:11.959
(cheering)

1:02:12.041 --> 1:02:14.667
(solemn music)

1:02:24.250 --> 1:02:25.583
- You're next.

1:02:26.250 --> 1:02:28.125
You're next.

1:02:31.208 --> 1:02:34.667
(claps)

1:02:34.750 --> 1:02:38.250
- Golden Dragon in
the final, not bad.

1:02:38.333 --> 1:02:39.208
Not bad.

1:02:42.750 --> 1:02:44.291
- Take care of that bitch.

1:02:44.375 --> 1:02:46.625
She cost me a lot of money.

1:02:48.792 --> 1:02:49.333
- [Ivan] Natalia, my pet.

1:02:49.417 --> 1:02:51.041
- Ivan.

1:02:53.250 --> 1:02:54.583
I didn't know you were coming.

1:02:54.667 --> 1:02:55.917
- [Ivan] And yet, here I am.

1:02:56.000 --> 1:02:57.166
I'm starving.

1:02:57.250 --> 1:03:00.667
Let us go somewhere
and eat and talk.

1:03:00.750 --> 1:03:03.083
- Yes, of course, I already
have a place reserved.

1:03:03.166 --> 1:03:05.959
(laughs)

1:03:11.917 --> 1:03:13.000
- So?

1:03:13.083 --> 1:03:14.000
- That was a pretty
good fight, Zoey,

1:03:14.083 --> 1:03:15.125
but dangerous as hell.

1:03:15.208 --> 1:03:16.917
I don't know what you're doing.

1:03:17.000 --> 1:03:18.542
- I'm fighting.

1:03:18.625 --> 1:03:20.750
- It was impressive, okay?

1:03:20.834 --> 1:03:21.667
But fighting like
this is not safe.

1:03:21.750 --> 1:03:24.417
- I've got this, Uncle Ray.

1:03:24.500 --> 1:03:26.625
- Yeah, you're doing good.

1:03:34.041 --> 1:03:38.208
(upbeat hip hop music)
(rapping in foreign language)

1:03:38.291 --> 1:03:39.875
- Golden Dragon.

1:03:39.959 --> 1:03:41.583
Great fight.

1:03:41.667 --> 1:03:43.291
Really great fight.

1:03:43.959 --> 1:03:44.667
What do you say I take you

1:03:44.750 --> 1:03:47.333
to some dinner tonight?

1:03:47.417 --> 1:03:51.333
And we'll have a little
chat about your future.

1:03:52.542 --> 1:03:53.417
Up for it?

1:04:02.291 --> 1:04:06.333
(singing in foreign language)

1:04:06.417 --> 1:04:08.208
- [Ivan] He says to
the man, read the card.

1:04:08.291 --> 1:04:10.834
(laughs)

1:04:10.917 --> 1:04:15.834
There was a card in
his bottom. (laughs)

1:04:17.500 --> 1:04:19.291
- Whatever.

1:04:19.792 --> 1:04:20.417
I'll take that.

1:04:20.500 --> 1:04:22.709
More champagne.

1:04:23.917 --> 1:04:29.041
Ladies and gentlemen, I present
to you the Golden Dragon.

1:04:29.667 --> 1:04:32.375
(ominous music)

1:04:32.458 --> 1:04:34.834
(clapping)

1:04:41.208 --> 1:04:46.125
- You know, I promote
these fights to make money.

1:04:48.542 --> 1:04:50.875
And now this very lucky girl

1:04:51.875 --> 1:04:54.875
is up for a fighting
championship.

1:04:56.166 --> 1:04:58.917
I can only imagine what
kind of money an underdog

1:04:59.000 --> 1:05:01.125
like you will bring to me.

1:05:03.542 --> 1:05:05.625
- Well I won't disappoint.

1:05:08.417 --> 1:05:12.333
- And that's what
I've come to expect.

1:05:12.417 --> 1:05:15.709
- See, she has always
been my favorite.

1:05:19.709 --> 1:05:21.250
- Favorite or not,

1:05:24.417 --> 1:05:28.709
there are times we must
do the hard things, hm.

1:05:28.792 --> 1:05:30.250
Things we don't want to do.

1:05:32.709 --> 1:05:35.375
Many people will bet on you

1:05:35.458 --> 1:05:38.750
after tonight's
extraordinary knockout.

1:05:39.792 --> 1:05:42.500
But we can't give them
what they want, can we?

1:05:42.583 --> 1:05:44.667
- And why not?

1:05:46.834 --> 1:05:48.709
- I have more pressing matters

1:05:48.792 --> 1:05:53.667
that will not allow chance to
dictate the fight's outcome.

1:05:56.250 --> 1:06:00.208
- You will throw the
fight in the second round.

1:06:07.208 --> 1:06:09.750
Your payment will be $100,000.

1:06:11.041 --> 1:06:11.792
- Hell no.

1:06:11.875 --> 1:06:12.792
- She's right, let us fight.

1:06:12.875 --> 1:06:13.500
- Shut up!

1:06:13.583 --> 1:06:15.291
- I won't throw this fight.

1:06:15.375 --> 1:06:17.083
(clicks tongue)

1:06:22.000 --> 1:06:25.709
- Don't be like
your father, huh.

1:06:25.792 --> 1:06:28.583
(chain jingling)

1:06:34.750 --> 1:06:37.959
He didn't cooperate either.

1:06:38.041 --> 1:06:41.709
(intense electronic music)

1:06:44.875 --> 1:06:47.125
(chair thudding)
(grunting)

1:06:47.208 --> 1:06:49.250
(glass shattering)

1:06:55.583 --> 1:06:58.291
(wood cracking)

1:06:59.917 --> 1:07:02.417
(tense music)

1:07:11.625 --> 1:07:14.792
(grunting)

1:07:22.083 --> 1:07:24.625
(laughing)

1:07:24.709 --> 1:07:25.583
- Get up.

1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:37.959
(glass clinking)
(glass shattering)

1:07:45.542 --> 1:07:46.667
(grunting)

1:07:46.750 --> 1:07:50.291
(dramatic music)

1:08:01.208 --> 1:08:02.375
(groans)

1:08:05.875 --> 1:08:07.250
(grunting)

1:08:16.375 --> 1:08:16.417
- Enough!

1:08:18.500 --> 1:08:22.959
Natalia, you will kill the
only means to pay your debt.

1:08:23.041 --> 1:08:25.000
(screams)

1:08:25.083 --> 1:08:28.375
- She fights on my
terms or not at all!

1:08:28.458 --> 1:08:30.875
- I can win without cheating.

1:08:31.458 --> 1:08:33.875
- I told you to shut up.

1:08:35.542 --> 1:08:37.375
- Natalia, listen to me.

1:08:37.458 --> 1:08:38.667
Do you really think this
girl can beat Tatiana?

1:08:38.750 --> 1:08:44.250
- (laughs) Maybe your lover
has very little faith in you.

1:08:45.166 --> 1:08:47.417
- I don't need your help to win.

1:08:49.083 --> 1:08:51.458
- Natalia, let this
Golden Dragon go.

1:08:53.125 --> 1:08:56.250
Let fate take its
course, understand?

1:08:58.834 --> 1:09:01.333
- Da. (spits)

1:09:03.625 --> 1:09:05.333
(dramatic music)

1:09:15.667 --> 1:09:18.291
(somber music)

1:09:19.291 --> 1:09:20.166
- Zoey?

1:09:21.208 --> 1:09:22.083
Zoey!

1:09:25.333 --> 1:09:26.583
Zoey, wake up!

1:09:26.667 --> 1:09:28.583
Zoey, wake up!

1:09:28.667 --> 1:09:29.875
Help!

1:09:29.959 --> 1:09:32.000
Help, someone help!

1:09:32.083 --> 1:09:32.583
Zoey, come on!

1:09:32.667 --> 1:09:33.750
Wake up!

1:09:33.834 --> 1:09:34.750
Zoey, wake up!

1:09:34.834 --> 1:09:37.458
Come on, help!

1:09:37.542 --> 1:09:38.667
Somebody help!

1:09:38.750 --> 1:09:39.125
Zoey, come on.

1:09:39.208 --> 1:09:41.250
Wake up, Zoey.

1:09:41.333 --> 1:09:44.125
(sirens wailing)

1:09:49.834 --> 1:09:50.375
(gasps)

1:09:50.458 --> 1:09:51.583
- Hey, hey, take it easy.

1:09:51.667 --> 1:09:53.333
Take it easy.

1:09:53.417 --> 1:09:55.166
- What happened last night?

1:09:55.250 --> 1:09:56.834
- I picked a fight.

1:09:57.834 --> 1:09:59.500
And I lost.

1:09:59.583 --> 1:10:03.875
- Look, I told you this
game was dangerous.

1:10:03.959 --> 1:10:06.083
Where did you find this?

1:10:07.166 --> 1:10:08.291
- Natalia had his watch.

1:10:10.083 --> 1:10:11.917
I think she killed him.

1:10:12.000 --> 1:10:13.291
- You need to go
to the cops then.

1:10:13.375 --> 1:10:14.083
- The cops?

1:10:14.166 --> 1:10:16.208
The cops are worthless.

1:10:17.333 --> 1:10:19.166
- Okay, so this is about revenge

1:10:19.250 --> 1:10:21.458
for you, that's what it is?

1:10:21.542 --> 1:10:24.291
They're gonna kill you, Zoey.

1:10:24.375 --> 1:10:26.208
You need to start
forgetting about all of this

1:10:26.291 --> 1:10:27.959
and just move on.

1:10:28.041 --> 1:10:30.583
(gentle music)

1:10:35.709 --> 1:10:38.792
- I'm afraid that if I move
on, I'm gonna forget my dad.

1:10:38.875 --> 1:10:41.875
(metal clinking)

1:10:41.959 --> 1:10:44.792
I have to fight for him.

1:10:45.792 --> 1:10:47.500
- You can't fight for him, Zoey.

1:10:49.917 --> 1:10:52.083
You can only fight for you.

1:11:10.625 --> 1:11:13.333
- Meditation is the
key to a clear mind.

1:11:13.417 --> 1:11:16.458
That will give your
body permission to
accomplish anything.

1:11:16.542 --> 1:11:21.208
We achieve this through poses
and breathing exercises.

1:11:22.375 --> 1:11:24.500
Remember your meditations.

1:11:31.875 --> 1:11:35.458
(uplifting orchestral music)

1:12:01.375 --> 1:12:02.208
- Hey.

1:12:03.917 --> 1:12:05.625
Well, it looks like
we're good for Friday.

1:12:05.709 --> 1:12:08.709
- No way, you've got to
tell them we need more time.

1:12:08.792 --> 1:12:13.250
- I did and they said that
the fight was Friday night.

1:12:13.333 --> 1:12:15.583
- It's okay, I'll be ready.

1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:18.667
Okay?

1:12:18.750 --> 1:12:19.500
(sighs)

1:12:19.583 --> 1:12:21.625
- Let's see how it feels.

1:12:21.709 --> 1:12:23.542
(dramatic music)

1:13:07.458 --> 1:13:09.291
- Don't go on your
back, get off.

1:13:09.375 --> 1:13:12.083
(intense music)

1:13:44.375 --> 1:13:46.166
- There are five elements
that maintain life.

1:13:46.250 --> 1:13:49.750
Earth, fire, air, water, spirit.

1:13:54.750 --> 1:13:58.041
Victory will not be
achieved unless you focus.

1:13:58.125 --> 1:14:00.291
Relax and flow as water,

1:14:01.917 --> 1:14:03.458
passing through the obstacles

1:14:03.542 --> 1:14:07.667
and penetrating your
adversary right to the core.

1:14:07.750 --> 1:14:09.583
(dramatic music)

1:14:57.291 --> 1:14:58.875
- They have Ray.

1:14:58.959 --> 1:15:00.458
They want me to throw the fight.

1:15:00.542 --> 1:15:01.208
- Who?

1:15:01.291 --> 1:15:03.125
- The fucking Russians.

1:15:03.208 --> 1:15:03.875
- Look, you've gotta do it.

1:15:03.959 --> 1:15:05.834
You've gotta throw the fight.

1:15:05.917 --> 1:15:06.667
- No, no.

1:15:06.750 --> 1:15:07.542
Listen to me, I've got a plan.

1:15:07.625 --> 1:15:09.417
You three just
carry on as normal.

1:15:09.500 --> 1:15:11.834
Get to the fight
and I'll find Ray.

1:15:11.917 --> 1:15:13.583
- How?

1:15:13.667 --> 1:15:16.125
- Just leave that to me.

1:15:16.208 --> 1:15:17.333
Get goin', go on.

1:15:17.417 --> 1:15:18.583
I'll let you know
when he's safe.

1:15:18.667 --> 1:15:22.458
- [Renee] Come on, let's
get dressed, let's go.

1:15:27.625 --> 1:15:28.709
(sighs)

1:15:34.792 --> 1:15:34.834
- Hey.

1:15:36.792 --> 1:15:38.250
Looks like we've got
a bit of a problem.

1:15:38.333 --> 1:15:40.917
(solemn music)

1:15:44.083 --> 1:15:46.542
- Feodor, let's make a wager.

1:15:47.667 --> 1:15:48.625
- Oh, my dear Natalia.

1:15:48.709 --> 1:15:53.750
What do you have that
I could possibly want?

1:15:53.834 --> 1:15:54.667
- This city.

1:15:57.375 --> 1:16:00.125
- Careful what you
wager, Natalia.

1:16:02.333 --> 1:16:04.542
- Tatiana wins.

1:16:06.041 --> 1:16:07.709
You leave.

1:16:07.792 --> 1:16:09.500
And my debt is paid.

1:16:10.709 --> 1:16:15.333
The Golden Dragon wins, I
leave and the city is yours.

1:16:16.625 --> 1:16:20.792
- Well, seeing that
I am a gambling man,

1:16:22.000 --> 1:16:25.709
and I am kind of fond
of this city, I accept.

1:16:28.583 --> 1:16:31.458
- Then I say
farewell to you now.

1:16:32.250 --> 1:16:34.291
- We will see.

1:16:36.917 --> 1:16:39.709
(thunder roaring))

1:16:47.083 --> 1:16:48.583
- [Renee] We've
got to keep calm.

1:16:48.667 --> 1:16:50.917
- Have you heard
anything from Jones yet?

1:16:51.000 --> 1:16:51.875
- No.

1:16:59.458 --> 1:17:00.625
(sighs)

1:17:00.709 --> 1:17:01.583
Zoey.

1:17:03.083 --> 1:17:05.041
I have something for you.

1:17:09.500 --> 1:17:13.083
(upbeat electronic music)

1:17:15.000 --> 1:17:16.792
(crowd cheering)

1:17:38.375 --> 1:17:41.417
(heavy breathing)

1:17:47.291 --> 1:17:49.041
- Keep it quiet.

1:17:49.125 --> 1:17:51.792
(heavy breathing)

1:18:06.959 --> 1:18:09.667
- Don't worry, Jones is
gonna find him, okay?

1:18:09.750 --> 1:18:11.125
Come on, let's get
your hair done.

1:18:11.208 --> 1:18:12.125
- All right.

1:18:12.208 --> 1:18:17.542
(crowd cheering)
(intense electronic music)

1:18:42.166 --> 1:18:44.500
- Well done, son, well done.

1:18:49.041 --> 1:18:50.834
(crowd cheering)

1:18:54.500 --> 1:18:56.458
- All right, all right,
all right, all right.

1:18:56.542 --> 1:18:58.041
Ladies and gentleman,

1:18:58.125 --> 1:19:00.000
now for your main event.

1:19:01.458 --> 1:19:04.000
The championship fight.

1:19:04.083 --> 1:19:05.333
Introducing the challenger

1:19:05.417 --> 1:19:07.792

(intense rock music)
(crowd cheering)

1:19:24.917 --> 1:19:26.250
- That's my girl.

1:19:26.333 --> 1:19:27.792
That's my girl.

1:19:40.959 --> 1:19:42.250
- We will see.

1:19:42.333 --> 1:19:44.083

1:20:42.500 --> 1:20:45.166
Tonight's contest
will go three rounds

1:20:45.250 --> 1:20:47.750
and three rounds only.

1:20:47.834 --> 1:20:52.625
Final round ending only when
a clear victor is determined.

1:20:54.083 --> 1:20:55.041
Your referee.

1:21:03.917 --> 1:21:05.542
- Zoey, look, don't worry.

1:21:05.625 --> 1:21:06.542
Jones is gonna find him.

1:21:06.625 --> 1:21:10.834
You go out there and you
handle your business.

1:21:17.959 --> 1:21:19.250
Let's do this, you
got it, let's go.

1:21:19.333 --> 1:21:21.000

1:22:32.083 --> 1:22:33.375
- Are you ready?

1:22:34.500 --> 1:22:35.834
Are you ready?

1:22:37.125 --> 1:22:37.542
Fight.

1:22:37.625 --> 1:22:38.333
(intense music)

1:22:38.417 --> 1:22:40.834
(grunting)

1:22:40.917 --> 1:22:43.250
- [Renee] Yes, nice, nice.

1:22:43.333 --> 1:22:43.667
Nice.

1:22:43.750 --> 1:22:45.375
Good kicks.

1:22:45.792 --> 1:22:47.417
You got it.

1:22:48.542 --> 1:22:49.875
Flip it.

1:22:49.959 --> 1:22:51.709
Nice, good off, good off.

1:22:51.792 --> 1:22:52.792
Oh!

1:22:52.875 --> 1:22:54.458
Come on, cover up.

1:22:54.542 --> 1:22:57.375
Crash with the fight, slip that.

1:22:57.458 --> 1:22:58.458
Come on, Zoey.

1:23:00.125 --> 1:23:02.750
Come on, Zoey, get
back on your feet.

1:23:02.834 --> 1:23:03.917
Get back up.

1:23:04.875 --> 1:23:06.208
(crowd cheering)

1:23:06.291 --> 1:23:09.875
Nice, nice.

1:23:09.875 --> 1:23:12.917
Good try, Zoey, good job.

1:23:14.709 --> 1:23:15.583
Zoey!

1:23:20.583 --> 1:23:22.208
Yes, yes!

1:23:26.000 --> 1:23:28.166
- [Woman] Come on, Zoey!

1:23:28.250 --> 1:23:30.667
- [Renee] Zoey, get up, get up!

1:23:30.750 --> 1:23:31.417
(buzzer blaring))

1:23:31.500 --> 1:23:32.959
Zoey!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:23:33.041 --> 1:23:33.667
Round's over, round's over.

1:23:33.750 --> 1:23:35.667
Break it up, break it up.

1:23:35.750 --> 1:23:36.917
- Come on, ref!

1:23:37.000 --> 1:23:38.291
- Hold her!
- Good shot, ref!

1:23:38.375 --> 1:23:39.083
Let's go.

1:23:39.166 --> 1:23:40.125
Come on, ref.

1:23:42.125 --> 1:23:44.333
- I'm getting killed,
where's Jones?

1:23:45.709 --> 1:23:49.166
(ominous music)

1:24:01.625 --> 1:24:04.500
(video game beeping

1:24:12.542 --> 1:24:15.417
(dramatic music)
(laughing)

1:24:15.500 --> 1:24:17.625
(grunting)

1:24:21.542 --> 1:24:23.375
- Damn, man, I just bought that.

1:24:23.458 --> 1:24:25.625
(grunting)

1:24:26.959 --> 1:24:27.625
(screams)

1:24:27.709 --> 1:24:31.041
(grunting)

1:24:31.125 --> 1:24:32.792
- Well done, well done.

1:24:32.875 --> 1:24:35.667
Someone's getting worried.

1:24:35.750 --> 1:24:38.750
- If she doesn't do
as we've instructed,

1:24:38.834 --> 1:24:41.291
kill her uncle at the
start of the third round.

1:24:41.375 --> 1:24:42.333
I'll take care of her.

1:24:51.375 --> 1:24:52.208
- Get up!

1:24:52.291 --> 1:24:55.000
(phone ringing)

1:25:01.125 --> 1:25:02.125
(screams)

1:25:02.208 --> 1:25:04.333
(groaning)

1:25:07.667 --> 1:25:10.417
(glass shattering)

1:25:15.875 --> 1:25:19.625
(muffled shouting)

1:25:22.750 --> 1:25:23.667
- Where the fuck is Jones?

1:25:23.750 --> 1:25:24.500
- I don't know, I don't know.

1:25:24.583 --> 1:25:25.291
But you've got to focus

1:25:25.375 --> 1:25:26.792
on this fight right now.

1:25:26.875 --> 1:25:28.000
You've got to get your head
in the game, Zoey, let's go.

1:25:28.083 --> 1:25:28.792
- Time's up, time's up.

1:25:28.875 --> 1:25:29.667
- We need more time.

1:25:29.750 --> 1:25:31.417
- Zoey look, you can

1:25:31.500 --> 1:25:32.917
walk off this mat, okay?

1:25:33.000 --> 1:25:34.959
There's no shame in that.

1:25:35.041 --> 1:25:36.667
The arm can heal.

1:25:36.750 --> 1:25:39.291
Give her the arm, let's go home.

1:25:39.375 --> 1:25:39.417
- I can't.

1:25:41.625 --> 1:25:42.709
- Then you get your
ass back up there

1:25:42.792 --> 1:25:43.875
and you fight your heart out

1:25:43.959 --> 1:25:45.291
and you beat the shit
out of this bitch.

1:25:45.375 --> 1:25:46.667
Let's go.

1:25:46.750 --> 1:25:49.417
- [Crowd] Fight, fight,
fight, fight, fight, fight.

1:25:49.500 --> 1:25:49.750
- Are you ready?

1:25:49.834 --> 1:25:51.250
Fight.

1:25:52.291 --> 1:25:53.875
(screaming)

1:25:53.959 --> 1:25:56.792
(dramatic music)

1:26:00.375 --> 1:26:03.250
(muffled screaming)

1:26:04.625 --> 1:26:06.709
- Yeah, just give me a minute,

1:26:06.792 --> 1:26:08.458
I'm a little busy!

1:26:08.542 --> 1:26:10.542
(grunting)

1:26:10.625 --> 1:26:11.291
Motherfucker.

1:26:11.375 --> 1:26:14.125
(phone ringing)

1:26:18.959 --> 1:26:22.083
(muffled screaming)

1:26:24.417 --> 1:26:25.250
(crowd cheering)

1:26:25.333 --> 1:26:26.500
- He's not picking up.

1:26:26.583 --> 1:26:28.792
I'm gonna go check it out.

1:26:36.959 --> 1:26:38.000
- Come on!

1:26:38.083 --> 1:26:40.625
(grunting)

1:26:40.709 --> 1:26:41.000
- Yes!

1:26:41.083 --> 1:26:42.375
- Get up.

1:26:43.500 --> 1:26:45.291
(crowd cheering)

1:26:47.834 --> 1:26:51.875
- [Crowd] Finish her,
finish her, finish her!

1:26:51.959 --> 1:26:54.041
Finish her, finish her!

1:26:55.667 --> 1:26:57.291
- Finish her, come on Dragon!

1:26:57.375 --> 1:26:58.083
- Get up.

1:26:58.166 --> 1:26:58.959
- Zoey, no!

1:26:59.041 --> 1:27:00.959
- [Crowd] Finish her!

1:27:01.041 --> 1:27:02.709
(crowd shouting)

1:27:02.792 --> 1:27:05.583
Finish her, finish
her, finish her!

1:27:10.875 --> 1:27:12.458
(grunting)

1:27:12.542 --> 1:27:12.792
(intense music)

1:27:12.875 --> 1:27:15.709
(groans)

1:27:20.875 --> 1:27:24.166
(wood thudding)

1:27:24.250 --> 1:27:26.750
(tense music)

1:27:29.291 --> 1:27:30.709
(groaning)

1:27:30.792 --> 1:27:34.083
(wood thudding)

1:27:34.166 --> 1:27:35.458
(gasping)

1:27:39.917 --> 1:27:42.083
- You know one more
minute and I had him.

1:27:42.166 --> 1:27:43.458
- Yeah, oh yeah.

1:27:44.625 --> 1:27:46.542
(heavy breathing)

1:27:48.000 --> 1:27:50.834
(dramatic music)

1:27:50.917 --> 1:27:54.917
- Ah! (hisses)

1:27:55.000 --> 1:27:57.875
Which one of you
fuckers are first?

1:28:00.375 --> 1:28:01.792
- I got this one.

1:28:05.083 --> 1:28:07.834
- If you insist. (sighs)

1:28:07.917 --> 1:28:10.750
(dramatic music)

1:28:16.583 --> 1:28:16.625
Oh!

1:28:23.125 --> 1:28:24.000
Not bad.

1:28:25.417 --> 1:28:27.709
(sighs)

1:28:27.792 --> 1:28:28.917
- Thanks for the help.

1:28:29.000 --> 1:28:29.542
- I'm exhausted.

1:28:31.291 --> 1:28:34.083
(crowd cheering)

1:28:36.125 --> 1:28:39.542
- [Man] Choke her
out, put her out!

1:28:39.625 --> 1:28:41.041
- Good, do it!

1:28:41.125 --> 1:28:42.208
Now!

1:28:42.291 --> 1:28:43.208
Finish her!

1:28:43.291 --> 1:28:46.834
(somber orchestral music)

1:28:55.000 --> 1:28:57.291
- Come on, Zoey!

1:29:14.834 --> 1:29:17.875
- [Natalia] Let's
do it, don't be shy.

1:29:17.959 --> 1:29:19.709
Woo, bravo!

1:29:21.709 --> 1:29:22.583
Yes!

1:29:27.250 --> 1:29:29.166
- You might want to read this.

1:29:29.250 --> 1:29:31.583
- What now, I'm about to win.

1:29:31.667 --> 1:29:41.417
- Yes, now.

1:29:41.417 --> 1:29:44.834
- What now, little field mouse?

1:29:45.208 --> 1:29:46.542
What now?

1:29:49.834 --> 1:29:52.500
(heavy breathing)

1:29:52.583 --> 1:29:55.417
(dramatic music)

1:30:02.709 --> 1:30:05.166
- [Javier] Meditation is
the key to a clear mind

1:30:05.250 --> 1:30:10.208
that will give your
body permission to
accomplish anything.

1:30:14.875 --> 1:30:17.542
(heavy breathing)

1:30:32.166 --> 1:30:34.667
- What does this mean?

1:30:34.750 --> 1:30:36.417
- I'm sorry, my sister.

1:30:36.500 --> 1:30:38.834
You should not have
stolen their money.

1:30:38.917 --> 1:30:40.291
I would have helped you.

1:30:40.375 --> 1:30:41.458
- I did not!

1:30:45.375 --> 1:30:48.917
- Don't you quit
on me now, Zoey!

1:30:50.458 --> 1:30:52.500
(gasps)

1:30:57.250 --> 1:30:58.250
- Let's go!

1:30:59.083 --> 1:31:01.000
(screaming)

1:31:01.083 --> 1:31:02.834
(crowd cheering)

1:31:02.917 --> 1:31:05.792
(grunting)

1:31:05.875 --> 1:31:07.709
- No, you don't
understand, I can explain.

1:31:07.792 --> 1:31:13.208
- I gave you everything
Natalia, but it wasn't enough.

1:31:14.417 --> 1:31:17.166
And now you have stolen from us.

1:31:18.458 --> 1:31:21.792
- It looks like you
just lost your bet.

1:31:21.875 --> 1:31:23.375
(grunting)

1:31:23.458 --> 1:31:26.583
Only thing is, I
don't really think

1:31:26.667 --> 1:31:28.709
you'll be going home, ha!

1:31:29.667 --> 1:31:30.834
- Fuck you!

1:31:30.917 --> 1:31:32.166
(intense music)

1:31:32.250 --> 1:31:33.667
(grunting)

1:31:36.208 --> 1:31:38.291
(thuds)

1:31:44.959 --> 1:31:47.291
(crowd jeering)

1:31:47.375 --> 1:31:48.750
(grunting)

1:31:56.333 --> 1:31:59.750
(crowd cheering)

1:31:59.834 --> 1:32:01.709
(bones crunching)

1:32:07.041 --> 1:32:07.917
Kill me.

1:32:09.166 --> 1:32:10.709
- I'm not a murderer like you.

1:32:12.417 --> 1:32:14.625
(crowd cheering)

1:32:14.709 --> 1:32:15.417
- Yes!

1:32:15.500 --> 1:32:18.291
(dramatic music)

1:32:21.250 --> 1:32:23.917
- Good job, Zoey.

1:32:24.000 --> 1:32:25.333
- Listen, I gotta
go call for backup.

1:32:25.417 --> 1:32:29.959
(sighs) I'll explain later.

1:32:35.041 --> 1:32:37.125
(clapping)

1:32:37.208 --> 1:32:40.834
(Renee screaming)

1:32:42.500 --> 1:32:44.125
- I'll take care of her later.

1:32:44.208 --> 1:32:46.834
We've got to get
out of here now.

1:32:48.834 --> 1:32:50.709
- You're under
arrest for murder,

1:32:50.792 --> 1:32:53.125
attempted murder,
illegal gambling,

1:32:53.208 --> 1:32:56.291
and for being just a
really, really bad person.

1:32:56.375 --> 1:32:58.125
- [Crowd] Dragon,
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

1:32:58.208 --> 1:32:59.750
- You're a cop?

1:32:59.834 --> 1:33:00.917
- Yeah, one of the good ones.

1:33:01.000 --> 1:33:01.458
- [Crowd] Dragon,
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

1:33:01.542 --> 1:33:02.000
- Come on, let's go!

1:33:02.083 --> 1:33:05.291
- Whoo! (laughs)

1:33:05.375 --> 1:33:06.291
(intense rock music)

1:33:06.375 --> 1:33:10.333
- [Crowd] Dragon,
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

1:33:10.417 --> 1:33:11.834
(cheering)

1:33:14.542 --> 1:33:17.917
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

1:33:19.000 --> 1:33:21.625
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

1:33:23.625 --> 1:33:27.041
Dragon, Dragon, Dragon, Dragon!

1:33:28.834 --> 1:33:30.000
Dragon, Dragon!
