00:05.846 --> 00:07.872
Hello. What's your name?

00:07.949 --> 00:09.917
Carolina.

00:09.984 --> 00:11.508
And what are your names?

00:11.586 --> 00:12.518
- John.
- Blake.

00:12.587 --> 00:15.181
Did I see you messing with Carolina?

00:15.256 --> 00:17.747
They were tugging on my braid.

00:19.761 --> 00:22.594
Excuse me. These children are?

00:22.664 --> 00:27.533
Most of them are orphans.
We care for as many as possible.

00:30.271 --> 00:33.604
Kissing children. Hugging orphans.

00:33.675 --> 00:37.839
What a vulgar, low,
despicable, political trick.

00:39.380 --> 00:40.813
Carolina.

00:40.882 --> 00:43.112
Would you like to be a princess today?

00:43.184 --> 00:46.244
I can't, I'm too little. Too <i>piccola.</i>

00:46.321 --> 00:51.224
Oh, no. Because I declare
that anyone can be a princess today.

00:51.292 --> 00:54.090
Well, why don't we get you a tiara,

00:54.162 --> 00:56.096
and you can wave,
and march in the parade?

00:56.164 --> 00:58.655
In fact, why don't you all take tiaras?

00:58.733 --> 01:01.497
All? Give them all free tiaras?

01:01.569 --> 01:03.503
- I'll take care of it later.
- Thank you.

01:03.571 --> 01:08.099
- <i>(girl) Yo quiero una verde.</i>
- <i>(girl #2)</i> I want a silver one.

01:11.379 --> 01:14.007
You won't be able to wave
with your thumb in your mouth.

01:14.082 --> 01:17.279
- I can wave with this hand.
- Very good.

01:17.719 --> 01:19.687
- <i>(girl)</i> I want the purple one.
- <i>(boy)</i> I want a crown.

01:19.754 --> 01:21.813
- <i>(boy #2)</i> Can we be in the parade?
- Of course, of course.

01:21.889 --> 01:24.687
We could always use
more princes in the world.

01:24.759 --> 01:26.886
OK, so...

01:27.829 --> 01:33.096
To be a princess, you have
to believe that you are a princess.

01:33.167 --> 01:36.432
You've got to walk
the way you think a princess would walk.

01:36.504 --> 01:41.305
So think tall, you gotta smile,
and wave, and just have fun.

01:41.376 --> 01:44.038
- So are you ready?
- Yes.

01:44.112 --> 01:47.479
Ah, she's letting the children join her.
How charming.

01:47.548 --> 01:49.106
Not for everyone.

01:49.183 --> 01:50.616
Drumroll, please.

01:50.685 --> 01:53.620
<i>(shouts)</i> Give the princess a drumroll.

01:53.688 --> 01:55.656
<i>(drumroll)</i>

01:55.723 --> 01:57.213
<i>(Kelly)</i> Forward...

01:57.292 --> 01:59.123
march!

01:59.193 --> 02:03.289
<i>("Breakaway" by Kelly Clarkson)</i>

02:03.364 --> 02:06.663
Just remember, you are a princess.

02:07.802 --> 02:12.000
<i>I'll spread my wings</i>
<i>and I'll learn how to fly</i>

02:12.073 --> 02:16.271
<i>I'll do what it takes 'til I touch the sky</i>

02:16.344 --> 02:18.209
<i>And I'll make a wish</i>

02:18.279 --> 02:20.770
<i>Take a chance, make a change</i>

02:20.848 --> 02:23.442
<i>And break away</i>

02:23.518 --> 02:25.509
There you go.

02:26.454 --> 02:30.083
- Everybody having fun?
- <i>(all)</i> Yeah.

02:30.158 --> 02:34.424
<i>But I won't forget all the ones that I love</i>

02:34.495 --> 02:36.190
<i>I'll take a risk</i>

02:36.264 --> 02:38.824
<i>Take a chance, make a change</i>

02:38.900 --> 02:42.392
<i>And break away</i>

02:42.470 --> 02:46.702
This has been Elsie Kentworthy and former
Miss Genovia, Hildegaard Huffman,

02:46.774 --> 02:50.710
at the best Independence Day
parade Genovia's seen in years.

02:50.778 --> 02:53.508
Thanks to Princess Mia's special surprise.

02:53.581 --> 02:57.108
May the rest of your day be sunny-side up.

02:57.985 --> 03:00.715
<i>(Mia)</i> And so, gentlemen,
the children from the shelter

03:00.788 --> 03:05.248
will be housed at the winter castle
in the mountains of Libbet.

03:05.326 --> 03:07.851
The use of the castle as a resort

03:07.929 --> 03:11.421
is sort of a perk
for parliament members and dignitaries.

03:11.499 --> 03:13.797
- Exactly.
- Oh.

03:13.868 --> 03:16.996
Well, I'm going to de-perk it,
and convert it into a children's shelter

03:17.071 --> 03:19.835
until money can be raised
for one of their own.

03:19.907 --> 03:22.603
I feel guilty
having two homes while they have none.

03:22.677 --> 03:24.110
<i>(whispers)</i> We're going to have
to do something. Where are we gonna ski?

03:24.178 --> 03:26.703
Lord Crawley, how is your brother doing?

03:26.781 --> 03:28.976
- I don't speak to my brother.
- Oh.

03:29.050 --> 03:32.645
Well, I've hired him
to be the architect on the project.

03:32.720 --> 03:35.120
- Mr. Crawley.
- Your Highness.

03:36.257 --> 03:38.248
Gentlemen.

03:38.326 --> 03:40.658
- Jerry.
- Dean.

03:40.728 --> 03:43.288
Well, I look forward
to getting your notes on these plans.

03:43.364 --> 03:44.456
But no one else's.

03:44.532 --> 03:46.966
- Oh, I'll give you notes, because I'm part...
- Oh, no, you won't. I'm an architect.

03:47.034 --> 03:49.366
- I am part of this parliament.
- Oh, you just go skiing...

03:49.437 --> 03:50.631
- So what if I go skiing?
...and you like to be an outdoorsman.

03:50.705 --> 03:51.899
- Oh, and you're a couch potato.
- Outdoorsman.

03:51.973 --> 03:52.871
- You're a couch potato.
- Outdoorsman.

03:52.940 --> 03:55.135
- Couch potato. Couch potato.
- Outdoorsman. Outdoorsman.

03:55.209 --> 03:57.507
- Couch...
- <i>(knocking)</i>

03:57.578 --> 04:00.570
The queen approves of the plan,
and I intend to see it through.

04:00.648 --> 04:06.382
Now, gentlemen, I don't think it'll take
too long to raise the money. Do you?

04:08.055 --> 04:09.613
We're setting up
the ramp in the ballroom.

04:09.690 --> 04:11.715
OK.

04:11.793 --> 04:13.226
- Hello.
- Hello.

04:13.294 --> 04:15.353
My hello's insignificant.

04:15.430 --> 04:18.887
Rosencrantz, Guildenstern, come with me.

04:21.067 --> 04:22.797
So.

04:22.870 --> 04:26.601
- Are you crashing my bridal shower?
- Sadly, no.

04:26.674 --> 04:30.542
I wanted to tell you that I was very
impressed by what you did at the parade.

04:30.611 --> 04:32.602
Thank you.

04:37.185 --> 04:39.517
I'm having a slumber party.

04:42.590 --> 04:45.024
Congratulations on the children's center.

04:45.092 --> 04:46.957
- Thank you. Thank you.
- That's wonderful.

04:47.028 --> 04:50.293
- She needs to get ready for the party.
- She's busy.

04:50.364 --> 04:52.025
Lenny, Squiggy, zip it.

04:52.099 --> 04:54.533
Lilly? The princesses are arriving.

04:54.602 --> 04:57.036
- Well, I should go and read my book.
- I should go and get changed. Yeah.

04:57.104 --> 04:58.594
- That's it.
- Bye.

04:59.540 --> 05:02.634
Hello, hello. Elsie Kentworthy here.

05:02.710 --> 05:06.771
Weeks before her wedding, Princess Mia,
in a stroke of skilled diplomacy,

05:06.848 --> 05:09.544
has invited royal princesses
from all over the world

05:09.617 --> 05:13.246
to her bridal shower slumber party.

05:13.321 --> 05:15.312
Hello, Princess Lorraine.

05:15.389 --> 05:18.756
- Oh, braces.
- Yeah. I'm getting two diamonds put in.

05:18.826 --> 05:19.952
Oh.

05:20.027 --> 05:22.086
That must make it more comfortable.

05:22.163 --> 05:23.323
Hi, Charlotte.

05:23.397 --> 05:26.423
Princess Aimee of Mallorca.

05:26.501 --> 05:30.335
- Is this my party?
- No, this is Princess Mia's party.

05:30.404 --> 05:31.894
Oh.

05:32.907 --> 05:35.239
<i>(giggling and laughing)</i>

05:36.344 --> 05:40.610

Well, maybe it wouldn't be so bad

11:30.798 --> 11:32.356
Are you mad?

so much that she's convinced herself

to marry someone that
she knows she can never love.

11:37.605 --> 11:41.905
I can't believe that I am hearing this.
You want her to rule?

After all the effort that we have put in,
to end up with nothing?

11:46.313 --> 11:51.683
It wouldn't be nothing. Genovia would be
in good hands, and she would be happy.

11:52.253 --> 11:54.084
Ah.

No.

No, Uncle, all that I'm asking...

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, you listen.

12:03.631 --> 12:08.398
What do you think will happen?
That she will leave Andrew and marry you?

12:08.469 --> 12:10.596
I put in the effort to make you a king,

12:10.671 --> 12:13.401
not to have you marry a queen.
I will not have it, sir.

12:13.474 --> 12:16.932
Don't worry, Uncle. That will never happen.
Mia doesn't care for me that way.

12:17.011 --> 12:19.502
Oh, but you care for her.

12:19.580 --> 12:24.643
Uncle, I just want us to stop
trying to sabotage her. That's all.

12:28.289 --> 12:31.520
All right. If that's what you really want.

12:35.162 --> 12:37.824
I just want your happiness, my boy.

12:39.066 --> 12:41.364
Go to her.

12:41.435 --> 12:43.596
Congratulate her.

12:44.571 --> 12:46.698
And tell her that we surrender.

12:46.774 --> 12:49.641
Thank you, Uncle.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.654
Elsie Kentworthy, please.

13:11.598 --> 13:13.896
<i>(coughing)</i>

13:13.968 --> 13:16.232
That's enough flaming ones for now.

13:16.303 --> 13:18.168
Are you sure I didn't burn you?

13:18.238 --> 13:21.332
- <i>(Lilly)</i> Of course you did. Look at his coat.
- No, no, it's very minor.

13:21.408 --> 13:24.502
You just sort of seared the sleeve. Look.

13:25.946 --> 13:27.470
<i>(Mia)</i> Sorry.

13:27.548 --> 13:31.314
<i>(Nicholas whistling Rachmaninoff)</i>

13:31.385 --> 13:33.512
- Lilly?
- Yes?

13:33.587 --> 13:36.385
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Uh-huh.

13:39.626 --> 13:42.117
Look over there.

13:44.732 --> 13:49.567
Should I shoo him? Should I shoo him?
Just tell me who I should shoo and I'll shoo.

13:49.636 --> 13:53.072
I just want to talk to Nicholas for a second.

13:53.140 --> 13:54.630
OK.

13:55.976 --> 13:58.035
- Backing off, please. Andrew?
- Yes?

13:58.112 --> 14:00.706
Why don't you go introduce
Lilly to your parents?

14:00.781 --> 14:02.544
You know, just tell them
I'll be up for brunch in a second.

14:02.616 --> 14:04.447
<i>(Lilly)</i> Yeah, I'd love
to meet Susan and Arnold.

14:04.518 --> 14:08.454
We can have those tasty
finger sandwiches together.

14:09.456 --> 14:10.514
Would you like some help?

14:10.591 --> 14:12.889
He's not the one she's marrying, is he?

14:12.960 --> 14:17.954
Would you please try to keep up, Brigitta?
He's trying to steal the crown.

14:20.467 --> 14:23.163
- Ready?
- Mm-hm.

14:23.237 --> 14:25.762
- Take your stance.
- OK.

14:28.776 --> 14:31.244
Elbow down. Just a bit.

14:33.280 --> 14:36.010
Use your mouth as an anchor.

14:36.083 --> 14:38.574
- Excuse me?
- Touch your mouth.

14:40.821 --> 14:42.618
Good.

14:42.689 --> 14:44.680
Relax this hand.

14:49.196 --> 14:51.596
And breathe in.

14:54.068 --> 14:55.501
Release.

14:57.571 --> 14:58.799
Oh.

14:58.872 --> 15:01.204
How did that feel?

15:02.309 --> 15:04.641
Wonderful.

15:06.213 --> 15:08.807
Wonderful.

15:08.882 --> 15:12.511
Turn around.
We should give them some privacy.

15:16.256 --> 15:20.488
I have to go. I really
only came back to pack my things.

15:21.762 --> 15:24.390
You're leaving?

15:24.465 --> 15:27.229
I think it's time I bowed out gracefully.

15:27.301 --> 15:29.599
Don't you?

15:30.637 --> 15:32.628
Goodbye.

15:33.907 --> 15:36.000
- Bye.
- Goodbye.

15:44.118 --> 15:46.086
Mia.

15:47.387 --> 15:50.550
Could I see you one more time before I go?

15:51.758 --> 15:54.784
Nicholas, I'm watched like a hawk.

15:54.862 --> 15:57.092
Princess, Princess.

15:57.865 --> 15:59.093
See?

15:59.166 --> 16:01.396
I'll find a way.

16:01.468 --> 16:02.298
Yes?

16:02.369 --> 16:06.032
Um, nothing.
I'm just supposed to watch you.

16:10.077 --> 16:12.272
<i>(crashing and clattering)</i>

16:25.792 --> 16:31.992
With only two and a half days left, Olivia,
I'm beginning to feel rather frantic.

16:32.065 --> 16:34.192
Would you take
Maurice out for me, please?

16:34.268 --> 16:36.293
I have to check the orchestra selections.

16:36.370 --> 16:39.362
And they asked you to approve a place
setting for the reception, Your Majesty.

16:39.439 --> 16:41.430
Very well.

16:47.347 --> 16:50.908
<i>(woman's voice) Our selections</i>
<i>for dancing at the royal reception.</i>

<i>(chuckles)</i>

17:20.646 --> 17:23.241
Have you been thinking about us?

17:28.387 --> 17:31.050
Yes, I have.

17:32.059 --> 17:34.289
I see.

17:34.361 --> 17:36.124
If you'll excuse me.

17:36.196 --> 17:40.155
No, Joseph.
You had to know what I was going to say.

17:40.234 --> 17:42.464
Mia needs me now more than ever before.

17:42.536 --> 17:45.733
It's the monarchy. I mean,
as queen it's my responsibility.

17:45.806 --> 17:46.966
You know how it is.

17:47.040 --> 17:49.531
You were never just my queen, Clarisse.

17:49.610 --> 17:52.738
You were the someone that I wanted
to spend the rest of my life with.

17:52.813 --> 17:59.184
But, if you prefer that I see you
first and foremost as my queen...

18:00.354 --> 18:01.878
- I shall oblige.
- No, Joseph...

18:01.955 --> 18:03.946
Your Majesty.

18:18.405 --> 18:20.396
<i>(music stops)</i>

18:26.847 --> 18:28.371
Your bed is turned down, Your Highness.

18:28.448 --> 18:31.713
If you don't need anything else, Princess,
we're going to supper.

18:31.785 --> 18:33.946
Oh. Well, enjoy yourselves, ladies.

18:34.021 --> 18:36.387
Ah-ah-ah. What did we talk about?

18:36.456 --> 18:38.424
No more curtsy.

18:38.492 --> 18:40.289
We're going to supper.

18:40.360 --> 18:42.521
Thank you.

18:42.596 --> 18:44.154
- Hi, Miss Lilly.
- May we announce you?

18:44.231 --> 18:46.290
I can announce myself. Lilly Moscovitz!

18:46.366 --> 18:48.425
- Mia, look out your window.
- Why? What's going on?

18:48.502 --> 18:53.337
Just look out your window.
Prince Charming is throwing pebbles.

18:55.776 --> 18:57.767
Nicholas.

18:58.945 --> 19:01.106
Nicholas, what are you doing?

19:01.181 --> 19:02.443
<i>(clears throat)</i>

19:02.516 --> 19:06.179
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, with hair so fine.

19:06.253 --> 19:09.416
Come out your window,
climb down the vine.

19:12.459 --> 19:15.087
The feat you ask, dear sir, isn't easy.

19:15.162 --> 19:18.529
And I won't respond
to that line, it's far too cheesy.

19:18.598 --> 19:21.328
So what does he want?

19:21.401 --> 19:22.868
He wants me to climb down the vine.

19:22.936 --> 19:24.767
- Well, do you want to?
- Yes.

19:24.838 --> 19:27.432
- So go.
- It's a recipe for disaster.

19:27.507 --> 19:30.999
Mia, do something impulsive
for once in your life. You're getting married.

19:31.078 --> 19:34.605
Do you want a regular bachelorette party
with 12 screaming girls,

19:34.681 --> 19:39.983
or do you want a stroll in the moonlight
with your almost-Prince Charming?

20:00.807 --> 20:04.402
I always like a man in shades.

20:04.911 --> 20:06.902
- Oh, Your Majesty.
- No, no, ladies.

20:06.980 --> 20:09.414
Come in, come in.
I was just about to leave.

20:09.916 --> 20:12.544
This really is more romantic in books.

20:12.619 --> 20:14.917
My foot is stuck.

20:16.223 --> 20:17.190
<i>(thud)</i>

20:17.591 --> 20:20.116
Oh, what was that?

20:22.529 --> 20:25.362

20:25.432 --> 20:27.957
Dormez-vous? Dormez-vous?

20:28.034 --> 20:31.731
Your Majesty, we never got to finish
our routine at the slumber party.

20:31.805 --> 20:33.238
And there's more dancing, too.

20:33.306 --> 20:36.070
Fr? Re Jacques, Fr? Re Jacques

20:36.143 --> 20:38.270
- Dormez-vous? Dormez-vous?
- <i>(thud)</i>

20:38.345 --> 20:41.405
- And there's a big finish.
- Yes, the big finale.

20:42.883 --> 20:45.249
<i>(grunts of pain)</i>

20:45.318 --> 20:49.277

- No, I... I'm used to it.

20:54.327 --> 20:56.158
Ding, dang, dong

21:00.767 --> 21:03.463
What a pity we missed it at the party.

21:06.306 --> 21:09.639
<i>(Lilly)</i> I'll cover for you. Go, Rapunzel, go.

21:21.655 --> 21:25.284
- <i>(Nicholas)</i> Tell me your greatest desires.
- Tell me a secret.

21:25.358 --> 21:27.553
- Isn't that the same?
- Almost.

21:27.627 --> 21:30.118
But anyone can see your desires.

21:30.197 --> 21:32.757
No one knows what's in your heart.

21:32.833 --> 21:34.960
- Tell me something.
- Um...

21:35.969 --> 21:40.736
I love <i>I Love Lucy</i> reruns.
And sometimes I dream in black and white.

21:41.741 --> 21:44.471
I used to pretend I was sick
when I had a test in school.

21:44.544 --> 21:46.705
- We all did that.
- OK.

21:48.181 --> 21:52.049
Sometimes, I put chocolate milk
on my cereal.

21:52.118 --> 21:55.485
I am deathly afraid of jellyfish.

21:56.490 --> 21:59.288
I haven't danced with you
since your birthday.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.827
That's a fact. It's not a secret.

22:01.895 --> 22:04.386
The secret is, is that...

22:04.464 --> 22:06.864
I still want to.

23:11.531 --> 23:14.329
- Good morning.
- Hello.

23:14.401 --> 23:17.370
- We stayed out all night.
- Yes, we did.

23:18.371 --> 23:20.703
We stayed out all night.

23:25.011 --> 23:26.308
Is that...

23:26.379 --> 23:28.677
- There's a man in that boat.
- What?

23:28.748 --> 23:31.478
Do you see that?
There's somebody over there.

23:31.551 --> 23:35.544
He's probably some fisherman, I suppose.

23:43.830 --> 23:46.025
With a video camera?

23:46.099 --> 23:48.465
- What?
- You're really low.

23:48.535 --> 23:50.526
No, Mia.
I have no idea who that man is.

23:50.604 --> 23:53.596
You know, it's really a shame he didn't
get juicier stuff last night, you jerk.

23:53.673 --> 23:56.369
Mia, I have nothing to do with this. I swear.

23:56.443 --> 23:59.037
Mia, please. Come on.
Will you listen to me?

23:59.112 --> 24:02.013
- That is not my boat.
- Hey, Nicholas? Have a nice life.

Good morning, my love.

I know it's a little early,
but I've been thinking.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.532
Things have been so pressured lately.

24:22.602 --> 24:25.901
I was wondering
whether we should spend...

Lilly?

24:28.608 --> 24:30.940
Good morning, Your Majesty.

24:31.011 --> 24:35.038

- I just wanted...

Lilly.

25:14.754 --> 25:17.621
- Could we have a moment alone?
- Yes.

So?

25:34.174 --> 25:36.506
I got played.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.706
A-ha.

25:41.715 --> 25:44.548
Well, the big question is:

25:44.617 --> 25:47.313
Do we still have a wedding?

25:48.354 --> 25:51.585
- Andrew, I am so, so sorry.
- Excuse me.

25:51.658 --> 25:54.786
Andrew, please wait.
I promise you nothing happened.

25:54.861 --> 25:57.625
Yes, but Mia,
you still went, didn't you? You went.

25:57.697 --> 26:01.360
I don't think you understand. I'm an
extremely eligible bachelor in England.

26:01.434 --> 26:07.100
I really am. I've got plenty of friends,
lots of lovely women friends, and...

26:07.173 --> 26:09.835
I still think this marriage is a good idea.

Mia.

26:29.696 --> 26:31.561
So?

26:31.631 --> 26:33.098
Anything?

26:33.166 --> 26:36.897
I really want to say yes, but no.
There's just, there's no...

26:36.970 --> 26:39.234
spark.

26:39.305 --> 26:41.603
Me too.

26:41.674 --> 26:44.165
- Really?
- Really.

26:44.244 --> 26:45.939
- I mean, it was pleasurable.
- Very.

26:46.012 --> 26:49.709
- Very pleasant, but, but, but no fireworks.
- None.

26:49.783 --> 26:53.184
What are we gonna do? Look, we will...

26:53.253 --> 26:55.653
We will figure something out.

27:01.027 --> 27:02.756
Mia.

27:07.400 --> 27:09.732
You chose me.

27:15.208 --> 27:17.039
No privacy.

27:20.413 --> 27:23.746
You chose me, and I accepted.

27:23.817 --> 27:26.718

never backs out on his word.

27:26.786 --> 27:28.310
We are going to...

27:28.388 --> 27:33.792
We're going to stand up in church and say
"I do," and tomorrow we'll be man and wife.

27:33.860 --> 27:38.092
And you are going to make
an amazing queen of Genovia.

27:41.634 --> 27:43.625

27:58.484 --> 28:00.111
I'm getting married today.

28:01.654 --> 28:05.784
<i>(Clarisse)</i> She's getting
married today, Maurice.

28:12.432 --> 28:15.924
Your Highness, we're running very late.

28:16.002 --> 28:19.733
Grandma says the queen is never late,
everyone else is simply early.

28:19.806 --> 28:21.706
Your Highness, a strange woman came in

28:21.774 --> 28:23.742
and said that she wanted
to hide in your closet.

28:23.810 --> 28:25.801
So I let her.

28:26.846 --> 28:29.838
Well, dear, that probably
wasn't the wisest decision in the...

28:29.916 --> 28:32.680
Now, this is what I call a closet.

28:32.752 --> 28:35.721
- Mom.
- Oh, my darling.

28:35.788 --> 28:38.655
- Careful. We're squashing Trevor.
- Hi.

28:38.725 --> 28:40.625
Hi, Trevor.

28:40.693 --> 28:43.127
He's sleeping. Shh.

28:44.063 --> 28:47.123
He is the most beautiful baby brother.

28:48.868 --> 28:51.735
We were joking.
We knew it was your mother.

28:51.804 --> 28:54.068
Your stepfather's here too.

28:54.140 --> 28:57.837
Now, I'm your mother, it's your
wedding day, I have to say something.

28:57.911 --> 29:02.439
Being married is about being yourself,
only with someone else.

29:03.816 --> 29:05.249
Thanks, Mom.

29:05.318 --> 29:06.842
<i>(knocking)</i>

29:06.920 --> 29:08.683
- How are you feeling? You look beautiful.
- I'm... Well, I'm...

29:08.755 --> 29:10.154
- You look so calm.
- I'm a little...

29:10.223 --> 29:14.216
Paolo is back to turn
a caterpillar into a butterfly.

29:14.294 --> 29:16.319
- There she go, butterfly.
- Paolo.

29:16.396 --> 29:19.229
Coat off. I tell you, when I say
"butterfly," the coat comes off.

29:19.299 --> 29:20.994
- <i>Principessa Mia.</i>
- Paolo.

29:22.001 --> 29:24.128
- You remember my mother, Helen.
- <i>Piacere.</i>

29:24.203 --> 29:26.194
- The hairdresser.
- And a new baby. <i>Monella.</i>

29:26.272 --> 29:28.502
All Italian men love baby - except Paolo.

29:28.574 --> 29:31.634
You got to get out now,
because we have to go to work.

29:31.711 --> 29:34.874
Five years ago,
Paolo take you from that to that.

29:34.948 --> 29:38.179
Today, he give you this.

29:38.251 --> 29:40.549
A wedding look for the bride.

29:45.325 --> 29:47.589
I look like a moose.

29:47.660 --> 29:51.061
Yes, but a very cute moose.
Make all the boy moose go...

29:51.130 --> 29:52.597
<i>(honks)</i>

29:53.499 --> 29:54.864
I have antlers.

29:54.934 --> 29:57.164
<i>(honks)</i>

29:58.071 --> 30:00.062
Go.

30:04.110 --> 30:06.305
I look like a poodle.

30:06.379 --> 30:10.076
That's just the way I feel.
Here we go again.

30:10.149 --> 30:11.776
Good. Sit up.

30:11.851 --> 30:14.649
She kind of does look like a poodle.

30:16.622 --> 30:18.613
I like it.

30:20.893 --> 30:23.919
This time I'm so sure,
I use my own pictures.

30:23.997 --> 30:27.626
So. <i>Un, deux, trois.</i>

30:28.167 --> 30:31.136
<i>(Mabrey)</i> Gretchen?
I can't find my gloves.

30:32.071 --> 30:36.030
You go on. I think it would be better
if I didn't go to the wedding.

30:36.109 --> 30:38.100
My boy.

30:39.178 --> 30:42.841
Don't give up so easily.
Come to church. Sweep her off her feet.

30:42.915 --> 30:45.383
In a week or two, she'll be yours.

30:45.451 --> 30:48.545
The game is over, Uncle.
She's going to marry Andrew.

30:48.621 --> 30:51.112
Ah, you're so right. Ah, well.

30:51.190 --> 30:56.093
This is a disaster in the making.
Wouldn't miss a moment of it.

30:57.130 --> 31:00.065
I'll try to catch the garter.

31:00.133 --> 31:02.693
<i>(shouts)</i> The royal carriage approaches.

31:02.769 --> 31:04.964
- What did he say, Artie?
- The princess is coming.

31:05.038 --> 31:07.029
Showtime.

31:08.474 --> 31:10.999
Suki Sanchez here from the USA.

31:11.077 --> 31:14.012
A long way from home,
but happily following a story

31:14.080 --> 31:16.344
that started in the streets
of San Francisco,

31:16.416 --> 31:21.877
and is about to have a happy ending here
in the small, beautiful land of Genovia.

31:21.954 --> 31:25.515
Prepare for the arrival of Princess Mia.

31:30.797 --> 31:32.788
Psst. Sir.

31:33.833 --> 31:39.669
I don't mean to talk out of school,
but there's something you must know.

31:39.739 --> 31:44.108
Your uncle called Elsie
and set you up with that video.

31:44.177 --> 31:47.635
Why doesn't that surprise me?
I should have known.

31:47.713 --> 31:48.941
He's up to something.

31:49.015 --> 31:52.314
He was much too delighted
that you aren't going to that wedding.

31:52.385 --> 31:54.945
- I must get to that church.
- Yes, yes, but how?

31:55.021 --> 31:58.081
Everything on four wheels
is already rented for the wedding.

31:58.157 --> 32:00.751
- Doesn't matter, I'll run.
- No, no. It's too far.

32:00.827 --> 32:04.058
No, no. You'll take the bike.

32:04.130 --> 32:06.291
The bike? Gretchen, what bike?
We don't have a bike.

32:06.365 --> 32:08.458
Your grandfather's bike.

32:17.243 --> 32:20.474
- <i>Buenas tardes, Tanya.</i>
- <i>Buenas tardes, su Majestad.</i>

32:20.546 --> 32:23.777
<i>Aqu? Le presento a mi t? O,</i>
<i>que nos visita de Rosario.</i>

32:23.850 --> 32:28.651
- Oh, how do you do, se? Or?
- I do better if you and I get married.

32:30.523 --> 32:34.721
I'm sorry. My uncle learned his English
watching the old Three Stooges movies.

32:34.794 --> 32:36.762
Sorry.

32:41.434 --> 32:43.163
Yes, well...

32:45.104 --> 32:46.901
You're not going to believe this.

32:46.973 --> 32:49.441
Lord Devereaux's riding
up the road on a bicycle.

32:49.509 --> 32:50.976
<i>(Nicholas)</i> Sir!

32:51.043 --> 32:52.704
Sir, may I borrow your horse?

32:52.778 --> 32:55.246
Oh, he needs my horse.

32:55.314 --> 32:57.748
<i>(Nicholas)</i> My bike is yours.

32:57.817 --> 33:00.615
How am I supposed
to herd sheep with a bike?

33:21.073 --> 33:24.702
Outspoken American activist
Lilly Moscovitz, the maid of honor,

33:24.777 --> 33:28.440
glides forward as a vision in pink.

33:28.514 --> 33:32.610
I'm a girl who loves black
and is wearing pink.

33:32.685 --> 33:34.312
<i>(all)</i> Aww.

33:35.321 --> 33:38.620
<i>(Elsie)</i> And Duke Andrew's
little nephew, Viscount Ludlow,

33:38.691 --> 33:42.252
affectionately known
as "James of the Cherub Cheeks,"

33:42.328 --> 33:46.287
comes down the aisle
as the royal ring bearer.

33:48.801 --> 33:50.530
- Hey, Joe.
- Hm?

33:51.537 --> 33:54.438
I just wanted to say, before I do this...

33:55.441 --> 33:58.308
I'm sorry you're retiring.

33:58.377 --> 34:02.279
- Who told you that?
- The maids know everything.

34:04.483 --> 34:10.251
Well, the heart does things
for reasons that reason cannot understand.

34:10.322 --> 34:12.813
You're preaching to the choir.

34:14.560 --> 34:15.857
<i>(knocks)</i>

34:15.928 --> 34:17.327
Princess?

34:17.396 --> 34:19.193
Yes?

34:19.264 --> 34:24.259
And you should know
that Nicholas did not set you up at the lake.

34:27.873 --> 34:31.138
- Are you sure?
- The maids know everything.

34:33.379 --> 34:35.643
We're ready when she is.

34:38.684 --> 34:40.947
<i>(organ music starts)</i>

35:31.070 --> 35:33.163
<i>(audience murmurs)</i>

35:35.675 --> 35:37.973
<i>(music falters and halts)</i>

35:39.211 --> 35:42.078
- Is this part of the plan?
- No.

35:42.148 --> 35:44.275
I...

35:44.350 --> 35:45.374
<i>(clears throat)</i>

35:45.918 --> 35:48.512
I'm going to need a minute or two.

35:50.556 --> 35:53.081
Thank you, Your Highness.

35:54.794 --> 35:58.594
<i>(Elsie)</i> Now the bride is moving
swiftly back up the aisle and out the door.

35:58.664 --> 36:01.929
- Let me.
- <i>(Elsie)</i> Not the traditional route.

36:02.435 --> 36:04.426
<i>(woman)</i> Princess Mia!

36:04.503 --> 36:06.061
- Princess Mia!
- Mia!

36:11.143 --> 36:13.703
- Helen.
- Honey, I'll be right back.

36:13.779 --> 36:16.009
I gotta change Trevor's diaper.

36:16.082 --> 36:21.577
Please, be seated. There'll just be
a momentary interlude. Thank you.

36:21.654 --> 36:26.023
- Do we rush after her?
- No, we never rush. We hasten.

36:26.092 --> 36:28.856
- You'll take care of this?
- Yes, yes. Yes, just one moment.

36:28.928 --> 36:30.953
<i>(Clarisse)</i> Out of my way.

36:40.639 --> 36:43.904
Oh, my dear. Mia.

36:43.976 --> 36:45.671
Oh, Grandma, I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

36:45.745 --> 36:47.406
- I... I just need a minute.
- No.

36:47.480 --> 36:49.641
- I can do this.
- No.

36:49.715 --> 36:52.479
- I can't do this.
- I know.

36:53.419 --> 36:55.614
Darling, listen to me.

36:56.622 --> 36:58.920
I made my choice.

36:58.991 --> 37:01.619
Duty to my country over love.

37:02.194 --> 37:07.393
It's what I've always done, it seems.
It was drummed into me my whole life.

37:07.466 --> 37:11.368
Now I've lost
the only man I ever really loved.

37:12.738 --> 37:16.504
- <i>(radio) Anyone got a 20 on Joseph?</i>
- I'm with the eagle and sparrow.

37:16.575 --> 37:19.601
Mia, I want you to make
your choices as a woman.

37:19.678 --> 37:21.771
Don't make the same mistakes I did.

37:21.847 --> 37:24.782
Make your own mistakes.
There'll be plenty of them, believe me.

37:24.850 --> 37:28.581
Now, you can go back into that church
and get married, or you can walk away.

37:28.654 --> 37:30.781
Whatever choice you make,

37:31.791 --> 37:33.850
let it come from your heart.

37:43.068 --> 37:45.127
- Excuse me.
- She's back.

37:49.608 --> 37:52.509
<i>(Elsie)</i> The princess
is reentering the church.

37:52.578 --> 37:54.637
She's walking down the aisle.

37:54.713 --> 37:58.149
More like cantering down the aisle.

37:59.218 --> 38:01.550
<i>(music speeds up)</i>

38:07.526 --> 38:09.517
Andrew, wait.

38:11.864 --> 38:14.594
Everyone deserves the chance
to find true love, right?

38:14.667 --> 38:16.601
Yes.

38:16.669 --> 38:18.899
Including us?

38:23.008 --> 38:25.568
Thank you.

38:26.979 --> 38:28.913
For, for, uh...

38:28.981 --> 38:33.509
saving me from doing
the proper thing for once in my life.

38:34.420 --> 38:37.014
Now all I have to do is tell Mummy.

38:38.090 --> 38:40.558
I have to tell everyone else.

38:40.626 --> 38:42.787
<i>(both)</i> Good luck.

38:54.139 --> 38:55.106
Helen.

38:55.174 --> 38:57.165
Welcome.

38:58.277 --> 39:02.373
A few moments ago, I realized
the only reason I was getting married

39:02.448 --> 39:06.509
was because of a law, and that
didn't seem like a good enough reason.

39:06.585 --> 39:08.246
So...

39:08.320 --> 39:11.380
I won't be getting married today.

39:11.457 --> 39:14.449
Sit. Sit. There may be a dinner.

39:16.962 --> 39:21.899
My grandmother has ruled without a man
at her side for quite some time, and...

39:21.967 --> 39:24.299
I think she rocks at it.

39:25.538 --> 39:29.372
So as the granddaughter
of Queen Clarisse and King Rupert...

39:29.441 --> 39:32.968
<i>(all)</i> King Rupert. May he rest in peace.

39:33.045 --> 39:38.506
I ask the members of parliament
to think about your daughters,

39:38.584 --> 39:42.179
your nieces, and sisters,
and granddaughters,

39:42.254 --> 39:44.586
and ask yourselves:

39:45.791 --> 39:50.421
Would you force them to do
what you're trying to make me do?

39:52.898 --> 39:56.299
I believe I will be a great queen.

39:56.368 --> 40:00.702
<i>I understand Genovia to be a land</i>
<i>that combines the beauty of the past</i>

40:00.773 --> 40:03.708
<i>with all the best hope of the future.</i>

40:03.776 --> 40:05.710
- Not now.
- Shh.

40:05.778 --> 40:10.078
I feel in my heart and soul
that I can rule Genovia.

40:10.149 --> 40:12.549
I... I love Genovia.

40:13.218 --> 40:18.053
Do you think that I would
be up here in a wedding dress if I didn't?

40:18.557 --> 40:21.492
I stand here,

40:21.560 --> 40:24.791
ready to take my place as your queen.

40:25.798 --> 40:28.323
Without a husband.

40:28.400 --> 40:31.062
<i>(woman) Viva Mia!</i>

40:38.577 --> 40:40.568
Every time...

40:41.480 --> 40:45.849
Every time this charming
young lady opens her mouth,

40:45.918 --> 40:51.879
she demonstrates a contempt
for the customs of Genovia.

40:51.957 --> 40:57.896
The law clearly states
an unmarried woman cannot be queen.

40:59.131 --> 41:01.759
Fortunately,

41:01.834 --> 41:04.302
there is another heir.

41:04.370 --> 41:07.203
No, there is not.

41:08.273 --> 41:11.538
I decline. I refuse to be king.

41:12.811 --> 41:17.510
Ladies and gentlemen, it is Princess Mia
who should have the crown.

41:17.583 --> 41:20.211
She's bright, and she is caring.

41:20.719 --> 41:23.654
But more importantly, she has a vision.

41:23.722 --> 41:28.284
One that will take Genovia forward,
and if the parliament were astute,

41:28.360 --> 41:30.157
they would name her queen.

41:30.229 --> 41:34.188
Listen to her.
She'll lead us into the 21 st century.

41:35.200 --> 41:40.137
And besides, just think how lovely
she'll look on our postage stamp.

41:41.807 --> 41:44.901
Lovely on a postage stamp?

41:44.977 --> 41:47.343
You would look lovely on a postage stamp!

41:47.413 --> 41:52.612
Don't you walk away from me, sir!
You have a duty, sir, to Genovia.

41:54.186 --> 41:56.450
He's, uh... he is very distressed.

41:56.522 --> 41:59.889
Your duty, sir, to the country! To me, sir!

42:01.126 --> 42:05.085
To Genovia! For your father! Nicholas!

42:05.164 --> 42:07.826
- The door.
- Shut the doors, quickly.

42:09.435 --> 42:11.198
Nicholas. Nicholas!

42:11.270 --> 42:14.535
Nicholas, I cannot have you
giving all, all this up just for a girl.

42:14.606 --> 42:18.167
- Now, look, we can still...
- Enough, Uncle.

42:18.243 --> 42:20.575
We're finished.

42:22.082 --> 42:23.572
What is happening here?

42:23.650 --> 42:26.210
Who's next in line for the throne?
The Von Trokens?

42:26.286 --> 42:27.583
We accept.

42:27.654 --> 42:29.918
Sit down.

42:33.059 --> 42:34.993
<i>(coughs)</i> Make a motion.

42:35.061 --> 42:38.360
- Are you OK? Do you need a...
- <i>(coughs)</i> Make a motion.

42:38.431 --> 42:40.399
Ah.

42:40.467 --> 42:43.061
- Prime Minister?
- Yes, Princess?

42:43.970 --> 42:46.165
I move to abolish the marriage law,

42:46.239 --> 42:50.733
as it applies to present
and future queens of Genovia.

42:51.211 --> 42:53.509
Will anyone second my motion?

42:56.382 --> 43:00.113
Keep eye contact with them.
Stare them down.

43:00.186 --> 43:02.848
No, not, not... Soften. Soften.

43:02.922 --> 43:04.947
Good.
