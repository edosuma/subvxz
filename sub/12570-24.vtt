00:04.459 --> 00:05.606
Isn't my

00:05.607 --> 00:06.751
engagement ring

00:04.459 --> 00:06.751
gorgeous?

00:06.792 --> 00:08.018
- Look how the light
- catches it.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.562
- You might want to
- put on sunscreen.

00:12.083 --> 00:14.063
Hmm. Nice cut.

00:14.064 --> 00:16.042
Flawless color.

00:16.082 --> 00:17.876
- How many
- karats is it?

00:17.918 --> 00:19.293
Enough to feed

00:19.294 --> 00:20.667
a family of rabbits

00:17.918 --> 00:20.667
for 20 years.

00:21.959 --> 00:23.105
Guys, it's not

00:23.106 --> 00:24.250
about the bling.

00:24.292 --> 00:25.584
- This ring is
- precious to me

00:25.626 --> 00:27.001
Because it shows

00:27.002 --> 00:28.375
how much Brooks loves me.

00:28.417 --> 00:29.709
And this rock means

00:29.710 --> 00:31.000
he loves me a lot.

00:32.584 --> 00:33.814
So, after you and Brooks

00:33.815 --> 00:35.042
are married,

00:35.083 --> 00:36.959
- is he going to
- bunk with Bertram?

00:37.000 --> 00:38.376
Because if I need you

00:38.377 --> 00:39.751
for a post nightmare cuddle,

00:39.792 --> 00:41.792
three's a crowd.

00:41.834 --> 00:43.417
Actually, sweetie,

00:45.083 --> 00:46.522
Brooks and I will

00:46.523 --> 00:47.959
probably get

00:45.083 --> 00:47.959
our own place,

00:48.000 --> 00:49.435
- but I will still
- be here every day

00:49.459 --> 00:51.417
- To take care - of you guys,
- Just like always.

00:51.459 --> 00:52.730
Good, because

00:52.731 --> 00:54.000
when you took

00:51.459 --> 00:54.000
that weekend off,

00:54.042 --> 00:55.792
- things got a little
- out of hand.

00:55.834 --> 00:57.059
- Yeah, I still - can't believe
- That judge wanted to

00:57.083 --> 00:58.334
- Try Luke
- as an adult.

to ask you.

01:55.542 --> 01:57.042
Emma, Zuri,

01:57.083 --> 01:59.000
- would you - like to be
- My bridesmaids?

01:59.042 --> 02:00.042
Yes.

02:00.043 --> 02:01.043
Of course.

02:01.083 --> 02:02.376
As long as

02:02.377 --> 02:03.667
our dresses

02:01.083 --> 02:03.667
aren't camouflage.

02:03.709 --> 02:05.000
- Even I can't
- pull that off.

02:06.083 --> 02:07.626
And Luke, Ravi...

02:07.667 --> 02:09.101
- I was hoping you two
- would be my Best Men.

02:09.125 --> 02:10.918
Really?

02:10.919 --> 02:12.709
It would be

02:09.125 --> 02:12.709
an honor.

02:12.751 --> 02:13.751
And I have

02:13.752 --> 02:14.752

It turns out

Brooks is not

02:28.542 --> 02:31.417
related to you?

02:31.459 --> 02:32.751
I booked the most

02:32.752 --> 02:34.042
amazing wedding venue.

02:34.083 --> 02:36.042
Madison Square Garden.

02:36.083 --> 02:37.563
Can't wait

02:37.564 --> 02:39.042
to invite 18,000

02:36.083 --> 02:39.042
of my closest friends.

02:39.083 --> 02:40.563
I think you're

02:40.564 --> 02:42.042
overestimating

02:39.083 --> 02:42.042
your friend count...

02:42.083 --> 02:44.042
By 18,000.

02:44.083 --> 02:45.563
Great. After we say

02:45.564 --> 02:47.042
our vows on

02:44.083 --> 02:47.042
the Jumbotron,

02:47.083 --> 02:48.542
I can shoot my bouquet

02:48.543 --> 02:50.000
out of the t-shirt cannon.

02:50.959 --> 02:53.125
Ugh. Very well.

02:53.167 --> 02:55.105
At least tell me

02:55.106 --> 02:57.042
you'll wear my dress

02:53.167 --> 02:57.042
from my fourth wedding.

02:57.083 --> 02:58.792
- That was - my favorite
- Marriage.

02:58.834 --> 03:00.042
- Why was it
- your favorite?

03:00.083 --> 03:01.105
We went on a cruise

03:01.106 --> 03:02.125
for our honeymoon,

03:02.167 --> 03:03.605
and he slipped

03:03.606 --> 03:05.042
overboard.

03:05.083 --> 03:06.834
- "Slipped"?
- Uh-huh.

03:06.876 --> 03:08.685
- If it was good enough
- for the Monte Carlo P.D.,

03:08.709 --> 03:09.876
- It's good
- enough for you.

03:13.083 --> 03:15.000
- Prepare to be
- dazzled.

03:17.083 --> 03:18.083
Ta-da!

You look

03:28.543 --> 03:30.000
just like

03:27.083 --> 03:30.000
my mother.

03:30.042 --> 03:31.459
I'm gonna need

03:31.460 --> 03:32.876
so much therapy.

03:32.918 --> 03:33.980
Oh! Don't you

03:33.981 --> 03:35.042
just love it?

03:35.083 --> 03:36.897
No. I look like

03:35.083 --> 03:38.709
the Space Station.

03:43.083 --> 03:44.250
Hey, Tony.

03:44.292 --> 03:45.439
What are you doing

03:45.440 --> 03:46.584
on October 19th

03:44.292 --> 03:46.584
next year?

03:46.626 --> 03:48.042
I'm not sure.

03:48.083 --> 03:50.018
- This calendar I got - from the Chinese
- Restaurant

03:50.042 --> 03:51.042
Only goes to

03:51.043 --> 03:52.043
the end of Rooster.

03:52.083 --> 03:53.626
Okay.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.059
- Well, save the date,
- because that's when

03:55.083 --> 03:56.334
Brooks and I

03:56.335 --> 03:57.584
are getting married.

03:57.626 --> 03:59.876
Oh. Well...

03:59.918 --> 04:00.939
Wouldn't that

04:00.940 --> 04:01.959
kind of be awkward?

04:02.000 --> 04:03.792
- I mean,
- we used to date.

04:03.834 --> 04:04.918
I've let you

04:04.919 --> 04:06.000
use my bowling ball.

04:08.083 --> 04:09.284
- And we'll always
- have that.

04:11.083 --> 04:12.397
But it would mean

04:12.398 --> 04:13.709
the world to me

04:11.083 --> 04:13.709
if you were there.

04:13.751 --> 04:14.855
You're such

04:14.856 --> 04:15.959
an important person

04:13.751 --> 04:15.959
in my life.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.855
(SCOFFS)

04:17.856 --> 04:19.709
Then... I'd be honored

04:16.000 --> 04:19.709
to attend your wedding.

04:19.750 --> 04:20.875
Oh.

04:20.918 --> 04:22.751
- As my grandma
- always said.

04:27.584 --> 04:29.084
Oh, Tony,

04:29.085 --> 04:30.584
that's beautiful.

04:27.584 --> 04:30.584
What does it mean?

04:30.626 --> 04:32.084
"Put me down for chicken.

04:32.085 --> 04:33.542
I'm watching my figure."

(ELEVATOR DINGS)

04:40.083 --> 04:41.584
Jessie,

04:41.626 --> 04:43.167
amazing news.

04:43.209 --> 04:44.938
I just got this

04:44.939 --> 04:46.667
great opportunity to run

04:43.209 --> 04:46.667
a new wildlife refuge.

04:46.709 --> 04:48.042
- Cool.
- Awesome.

04:52.752 --> 04:54.167
I'm so proud of you.

04:51.334 --> 04:54.167
Thanks.

04:54.209 --> 04:55.626
And, to get the job,

04:55.627 --> 04:57.042
I have to be

04:54.209 --> 04:57.042
in Africa in two days.

04:57.918 --> 04:59.042
Two days?

04:59.083 --> 05:01.042
Isn't this exciting?

05:01.083 --> 05:02.563
Ah. It's definitely

05:02.564 --> 05:04.042
something...

05:04.083 --> 05:05.605
That we need to

05:05.606 --> 05:07.125
talk about...

05:04.083 --> 05:07.125
In the kitchen.

05:07.167 --> 05:09.042
- Why? What's in
- the kitchen?

05:09.083 --> 05:10.167
Not us.

05:10.168 --> 05:11.250
Try to keep up!

05:14.626 --> 05:15.813
Guys, do you know

05:15.814 --> 05:17.000
what this means?

05:17.042 --> 05:18.042
Yes, Brooks has to

05:18.043 --> 05:19.043
buy an airplane ticket

05:19.083 --> 05:21.042
- to Africa
- at the last minute.

05:21.083 --> 05:22.083
He will be paying

05:22.084 --> 05:23.084
through the nose.

05:24.083 --> 05:26.042
Forget his nose.

05:26.083 --> 05:28.042
- If Jessie moves
- away with Brooks,

05:28.083 --> 05:29.123
- We'll lose her
- forever.

05:35.334 --> 05:36.688
You're moving to

05:36.689 --> 05:38.042
Africa in two days?

05:38.083 --> 05:39.292
- Jessie, you're
- hurting me.

Fingers are fusing.

05:40.668 --> 05:42.000

05:44.000 --> 05:45.059
- And I'm not
- the only one moving.

05:45.083 --> 05:46.918
- Obviously my wife
- will come with me.

05:46.959 --> 05:48.334
You're married?

05:48.375 --> 05:49.688
I knew there

05:49.689 --> 05:51.000
had to be something

05:48.375 --> 05:51.000
wrong with you.

05:51.042 --> 05:53.063
No, I mean I want us

05:53.064 --> 05:55.083
to get married

05:51.042 --> 05:55.083
before we go.

05:55.125 --> 05:57.042
- You expect me - to give up
- My entire life

05:57.083 --> 05:58.397
And move to Africa

05:58.398 --> 05:59.709
in two days?

05:59.751 --> 06:01.101
- This might be - a bad time
- To mention it,

06:01.125 --> 06:02.625
But you also

06:02.626 --> 06:04.125
have to get

06:01.125 --> 06:04.125
a lot of shots.

06:04.167 --> 06:06.042
- What about
- the kids?

06:06.083 --> 06:08.059
- I was still planning on - being
their nanny - After we got married.

06:08.083 --> 06:09.418
Honey, I know

06:09.419 --> 06:10.751
you love them,

06:10.792 --> 06:12.418
but you weren't planning

06:12.419 --> 06:14.042
on being their nanny

06:10.792 --> 06:14.042
forever, right?

06:15.083 --> 06:16.876
I guess not...

06:16.918 --> 06:18.768
- But I at least - wanted to get Luke
- Through high school,

06:18.792 --> 06:20.292
Which actually

06:20.293 --> 06:21.792
could take forever.

06:21.834 --> 06:23.334
Jessie, this is

06:23.335 --> 06:24.834
the chance of

06:21.834 --> 06:24.834
a lifetime for me,

06:24.876 --> 06:26.355
but it won't

06:26.356 --> 06:27.834
mean anything

06:24.876 --> 06:27.834
without you.

06:29.083 --> 06:31.000
- Please, please
- come with me.

06:34.792 --> 06:36.042
- Okay,
- let's do it.

06:36.083 --> 06:37.459
(LAUGHS)

06:39.083 --> 06:40.418
But I have no idea

06:40.419 --> 06:41.751
how I'm going to

06:39.083 --> 06:41.751
tell the kids.

06:41.792 --> 06:43.000

06:54.502 --> 06:55.918
for throwing me

06:53.083 --> 06:55.918
this bachelorette party.

06:56.981 --> 06:58.000
and crazy trouble

06:55.959 --> 06:58.000
are we going to get into?

06:59.083 --> 07:01.042
- Unless you litter,
- this is pretty much it.

07:03.083 --> 07:04.583
Oh, let's hope

07:04.584 --> 07:06.083
the cops don't come.

07:06.125 --> 07:07.542
But we did

07:07.543 --> 07:08.959
put together a little

07:06.125 --> 07:08.959
slide show for you.

07:10.375 --> 07:12.083

- so sweet.

07:15.293 --> 07:16.293

- Like to see

What my high school

07:19.605 --> 07:21.083
graduation is

07:18.125 --> 07:21.083
gonna be like.

07:21.125 --> 07:23.083
- Since you
- won't be there.

07:25.083 --> 07:26.375
- You're also
- going to miss me

07:26.417 --> 07:27.668
Winning the

07:27.669 --> 07:28.918
Congressional Medal

07:26.417 --> 07:28.918

07:28.959 --> 07:30.000
For fashion.

07:32.959 --> 07:34.101
- EMMA: See that
- empty chair?

07:34.125 --> 07:35.480
That's where

07:35.481 --> 07:36.834
you were supposed

07:34.125 --> 07:36.834
to be sitting,

07:36.876 --> 07:37.960
but you couldn't

07:37.961 --> 07:39.042
make it back

07:36.876 --> 07:39.042
from Africa.

07:39.083 --> 07:40.418
Because you were

07:40.419 --> 07:41.751
eaten by a meerkat.

07:43.083 --> 07:45.042
- Meerkats don't
- eat people.

07:45.083 --> 07:47.000
- It was
- an angry meerkat.

07:48.876 --> 07:50.125
Okay, guys,

07:50.167 --> 07:51.271
I know you're upset,

07:51.272 --> 07:52.375
and I don't

07:50.167 --> 07:52.375
blame you but...

07:53.375 --> 07:55.375
You're amazing kids,

07:55.417 --> 07:56.730
and you're

07:56.731 --> 07:58.042
going to be okay.

07:58.083 --> 07:59.083
Besides, it's not like

07:59.084 --> 08:00.083
this is easy

07:58.083 --> 08:00.083
for me, either,

08:00.125 --> 08:02.059
- my dad's not even - going to be
- At my wedding.

08:02.083 --> 08:03.272
Why not?

08:03.273 --> 08:04.459
Well, He's deployed.

08:04.500 --> 08:06.042
- Apparently it's
- a "big deal"

08:06.083 --> 08:07.604
- To turn around
- an aircraft carrier.

08:09.042 --> 08:10.542
Bessie. Urchins.

08:10.543 --> 08:12.042
There you are.

08:12.083 --> 08:13.876
You made it!

08:13.918 --> 08:15.000
Yay!

08:16.083 --> 08:17.542
I wanted to show you

08:17.543 --> 08:19.000
your wedding cake.

08:24.959 --> 08:26.042
JESSIE: Oh!

08:26.083 --> 08:27.480
That's a nice

08:27.481 --> 08:28.876
picture of Brooks,

08:28.918 --> 08:30.209
but where am I?

08:30.250 --> 08:31.750
The bride's picture

08:31.751 --> 08:33.250
is in its traditional

08:30.250 --> 08:33.250
location.

08:33.292 --> 08:34.313
Under the

08:34.315 --> 08:35.333
plastic florette.

08:36.250 --> 08:37.417
How nice.

08:39.542 --> 08:41.042
But shouldn't

08:41.043 --> 08:42.542
the groom and

08:39.542 --> 08:42.542
the bride be visible?

08:42.583 --> 08:44.042
Diva alert.

08:46.083 --> 08:48.188
Yeah. Sorry for making

08:48.189 --> 08:50.292
my wedding all about me.

08:50.334 --> 08:52.143
- And, by the way, - we've decided to
- Have the ceremony

08:52.167 --> 08:53.542
In the penthouse.

08:53.584 --> 08:55.417
Swell. (CHUCKLES)

08:55.459 --> 08:56.771
Why not just hold it

08:56.772 --> 08:58.083
in the men's room

08:55.459 --> 08:58.083
of the Port Authority?

09:02.083 --> 09:03.083
Ah! Bees!

09:07.375 --> 09:08.459
- I didn't see
- any bees.

09:08.500 --> 09:09.834
Shh.

(LASERS BLASTING)

09:14.959 --> 09:16.439
Hey. When you said

09:16.440 --> 09:17.918
we'd have a laser tag

09:14.959 --> 09:17.918
bachelor party,

09:17.959 --> 09:18.959
I didn't think

09:18.960 --> 09:19.959
you guys would have

09:17.959 --> 09:19.959
actual lasers.

So, you have

09:31.606 --> 09:33.125
a choice.

09:33.167 --> 09:34.834
You can go

09:34.835 --> 09:36.500
to Africa

09:33.167 --> 09:36.500
without Jessie,

09:36.542 --> 09:37.918
or go to Africa

09:37.919 --> 09:39.292
with Jessie,

Okay, I don't know

09:54.314 --> 09:55.542
much about

09:53.083 --> 09:55.542
bachelor parties,

09:55.584 --> 09:57.480
but I'm pretty sure

09:57.481 --> 09:59.375
you're not supposed to

09:55.584 --> 09:59.375
vaporize the groom.

09:59.417 --> 10:00.709
We were just having

10:00.710 --> 10:02.000
a little fun,

09:59.417 --> 10:02.000
right, Brooks?

10:02.042 --> 10:03.042
No harm done.

10:03.083 --> 10:04.542
Yeah, except

10:04.543 --> 10:06.000
for my pants.

10:03.083 --> 10:06.000
They're ruined.

10:06.042 --> 10:07.542
But the lasers

10:07.543 --> 10:09.042
did not go anywhere

10:06.042 --> 10:09.042
near your pants.

I know this is

hard for you,

10:16.083 --> 10:17.542
okay? I get it

10:17.543 --> 10:19.000
and I'm so sorry,

10:19.542 --> 10:21.042
but...

10:21.083 --> 10:23.042
- I guess I was
- just hoping

10:23.083 --> 10:25.364
- You could find it - in your hearts
- To be happy for me.

10:29.125 --> 10:30.688
I am so disappointed

10:30.689 --> 10:32.250
in all of you.

your happiness

before hers

10:40.127 --> 10:41.626
when you've fallen.

10:38.626 --> 10:41.626
She's...

10:41.667 --> 10:43.334
Made you laugh

10:43.335 --> 10:45.000
when you were sad.

10:45.042 --> 10:46.063
She's even managed

10:46.064 --> 10:47.083
to turn you into

young men and women

10:47.125 --> 10:48.584

10:48.585 --> 10:50.042
totally unbearable.

That's fair.

that you love

and support her.

going to blast the door

open with a laser?

apologize for

11:50.459 --> 11:53.125
how we were acting.

unnecessary LASIK surgery.

you away from us.

- for me, too.
