00:07.107 --> 00:11.510
Latin lover narrator: <i>Our story</i>
<i>begins 13 and a half years ago,</i>

00:11.512 --> 00:14.713
<i>When jane gloriana villanueva</i>
<i>was a mere ten years old.</i>

00:14.715 --> 00:17.449
<i>It should be noted</i>
<i>that at a mere ten years old,</i>

00:17.451 --> 00:20.252
<i>Jane's passions include--</i>
<i>in no particular order--</i>

00:20.254 --> 00:21.587
<i>Her family, god,</i>

00:21.589 --> 00:23.589
<i>And grilled cheese sandwiches.</i>

00:25.692 --> 00:28.293
<i>This is jane's grandmother,</i>

00:28.295 --> 00:30.462
<i>Alba gloriana villanueva.</i>

00:30.464 --> 00:32.798
<i>Her passions</i>
<i>include god and jane,</i>

00:32.800 --> 00:34.600
<i>In that particular order.</i>

00:41.608 --> 00:43.475
Woman:
Really, mom?

00:43.477 --> 00:45.210
Shh.
But this is so lame.

00:45.212 --> 00:46.211
Mommy, shh!

00:46.213 --> 00:47.479
<i>This is jane's mother,</i>

00:47.481 --> 00:49.481
<i>Xiomara gloriana villanueva.</i>

00:49.483 --> 00:52.584
<i>Her passions include jane</i>
<i>and paulina rubio.</i>

00:52.586 --> 00:55.487
<i>The order is not important.</i>

00:59.325 --> 01:01.160
Bien.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.700
I can't.

01:20.246 --> 01:22.448
<i>And jane never did.</i>

01:25.185 --> 01:27.386
(young man panting passionately)

01:27.388 --> 01:30.789
Young man:
Oh, jane...

01:30.791 --> 01:33.358
(moaning passionately)

01:36.396 --> 01:37.830
We should...

01:37.832 --> 01:40.399
I know. Mm-hmm.
Mmm.

01:40.401 --> 01:42.501
(moaning, kissing)

01:44.137 --> 01:45.737
Stop. We should stop.

01:45.739 --> 01:49.508
(panting)

01:51.277 --> 01:52.744
Whew.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.480
(exhales):
Ah...

01:59.419 --> 02:01.487
(sighs deeply)

02:01.489 --> 02:03.489
Don't forget this.

02:03.491 --> 02:05.791
Thanks for stopping by.

02:05.793 --> 02:08.393
(romantic spanish song playing)

02:14.334 --> 02:16.201
(song increases in volume)
<i>ay, ay, ay.</i>

02:16.203 --> 02:18.570
At least
you could turn it down.

02:21.574 --> 02:23.375
Mom, she doesn't have
to watch if she doesn't want to.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.877
Of course I'm gonna watch.
You guys got me hooked

02:24.879 --> 02:26.678
On these things.
But you really have to know

02:26.680 --> 02:29.781
Telenovelas have ruined romance
for me.
Shh, shh, shh.

02:36.589 --> 02:38.323
(sighs)

02:44.497 --> 02:46.498
What?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.901
Nothing.
Eat your grilled cheese.

02:48.903 --> 02:51.503
(romantic song swells in volume)

03:04.217 --> 03:07.386
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Meanwhile, 8.2 miles away</i>

03:07.388 --> 03:09.221
<i>From where jane lives,</i>

03:09.223 --> 03:12.591
<i>But half a world away...</i>

03:15.395 --> 03:17.396
Woman:
Raf?

03:17.398 --> 03:18.897
Babe.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.732
You all right?

03:20.734 --> 03:22.367
Yeah.

03:22.369 --> 03:24.603
Yeah. Just... Thinking.

03:24.605 --> 03:25.837
Worrying about the hotel.

03:27.373 --> 03:28.507
Look, if anything goes wrong,

03:28.509 --> 03:29.808
Your father will help out.

03:29.810 --> 03:31.243
(sighs)

03:31.245 --> 03:32.911
Stop.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.380
Do you know who feels bad
about taking money?

03:35.382 --> 03:36.882
People who have too much.

03:36.884 --> 03:37.950
(both chuckling)

03:40.420 --> 03:43.288
That's better. See?

03:43.290 --> 03:46.825
You just need to relax.

03:56.769 --> 04:00.239
Mother: You're starting to
seem desperate, petra.

04:00.241 --> 04:01.940
I do not blame you.

04:01.942 --> 04:04.676
Your husband does
not love you anymore.

04:04.678 --> 04:07.012
You're wrong, mother.
It's all right.

04:07.014 --> 04:10.415
Tomorrow will change everything.

04:10.417 --> 04:13.752
I still haven't
decided whether...
Oh, you will.

04:13.754 --> 04:17.389
You will.

04:17.391 --> 04:19.391
Maybe michael's gonna propose.

04:19.393 --> 04:21.994
My sisters say guys get all
cheeseball before they propose.

04:21.996 --> 04:24.596
No way. We have a
timeline, all right?

04:24.598 --> 04:26.598
I haven't gotten my
teacher's degree yet.

04:26.600 --> 04:28.867
We just merged
our calendars...
You've been dating for two years

04:28.869 --> 04:31.670
And you haven't boned.
He might move up your timeline.

04:31.672 --> 04:33.705
Everybody decent?

04:33.707 --> 04:34.940
Who are you?

04:34.942 --> 04:36.875
Roman zazo.
But everyone calls me zaz.

04:36.877 --> 04:38.410
I work for the, uh,
management company

04:38.412 --> 04:39.745
That just bought
the hotel.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.546
So you can think of me
as your new boss.

04:41.548 --> 04:43.482
Pick a straw, please.

04:43.484 --> 04:45.751
Pick one, keeping in mind
there's nothing to worry about

04:45.753 --> 04:48.754
As long as you're outstanding
at your job. Pick one.

04:48.756 --> 04:53.558
Which benefits us all, seeing
that we have the same goal,

04:53.560 --> 04:56.628
That goal being to make bank.
Okay.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.563
Let's see those straws.

05:01.534 --> 05:03.602
(sighs)

05:04.570 --> 05:06.471
What's your name?

05:06.473 --> 05:08.807
Jane.
But everyone calls her jaz.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.809
(snorts)
okay, jaz.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.477
Congratulations.

05:12.479 --> 05:13.945
You get the tail.

05:13.947 --> 05:16.014
â™ª

05:28.961 --> 05:31.430
I can't believe
we have to do this.

05:31.432 --> 05:33.398
Do what?

05:34.767 --> 05:36.034
Rafael:
<i>I don't know, luisa.</i>

05:36.036 --> 05:38.837
Raf, if you're
not happy, end it.

05:38.839 --> 05:41.973
It's hard. Petra stood by me.
I know.

05:41.975 --> 05:44.643
But that doesn't mean that
you owe her your whole life.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.479
Look, you've changed.
I mean, of course you did.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.748
If you didn't change, then
I'd be worried about you.

05:49.750 --> 05:51.450
And you know what?
It's a good thing,

05:51.452 --> 05:52.651
Because you were so
insufferable before.

05:52.653 --> 05:53.985
Hey!

05:53.987 --> 05:55.987
As your sister,
I can say that.

05:55.989 --> 05:59.057
I loved you then, I
love you now and...

05:59.059 --> 06:02.794
If you do get a divorce,
it doesn't make you

06:02.796 --> 06:04.396
Our father.

06:04.398 --> 06:05.731
Rafael:
Thanks, lu.

06:05.733 --> 06:07.599
Now go home
to your wife.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.534
Say hi
to allison for me.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.609
(indistinct conversation)

06:33.493 --> 06:36.962
Hey, do you remember a guy
named rafael solano

06:36.964 --> 06:38.730
When we worked
at the yacht club?
He was, like, a member..

06:38.732 --> 06:40.899
The jerk you had
a monster crush on?

06:40.901 --> 06:43.101
I didn't have a
<i>monster</i> crush on him.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.970
We talking
about the same guy?

06:44.972 --> 06:46.705
You had a magical kiss.

06:46.707 --> 06:48.106
Who'd you have
a magical kiss with?

06:48.108 --> 06:49.708
No one. I was young.
It was nothing.

06:49.710 --> 06:51.143
What was nothing?

06:51.145 --> 06:53.011
Hey, I need someone to run
champagne to cabana four asap.

06:53.013 --> 06:55.647
I got it.

07:00.987 --> 07:04.489
I'll hand out glasses.

07:05.792 --> 07:07.926
You look familiar.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.195
Really? Hmm.

07:10.197 --> 07:13.665
I'm not sure.
No, I really
think we've met.

07:13.667 --> 07:17.002
I don't usually
wear clamshells.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.938
Oh. The strip club
on biscayne?

07:19.940 --> 07:22.207
Jerk.
(tapping on glass)

07:22.209 --> 07:24.609
Please. A toast.

07:24.611 --> 07:27.479
To my husband.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.548
Welcome back, babe.
Oh.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.950
(applause,
guests murmur happily)

07:44.797 --> 07:47.165
(soft, passionate moaning)

07:53.573 --> 07:56.107
Allison:
Luisa.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.880
(keys tapping)

08:42.522 --> 08:46.591
(alarm beeping)

08:48.194 --> 08:51.530
(groans quietly)

08:51.532 --> 08:53.899
(crying softly)

09:01.207 --> 09:03.575
(sniffles)

09:03.577 --> 09:06.244
Woman:
Doctor's office...

09:06.246 --> 09:10.115
Oh, there you are, dr. Alver.
You're running a little behind.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.117
(cell phone ringing)
remember you're covering
for dr. Peters.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.853
You have an insemination in
seven, then a pap in eight.

09:14.855 --> 09:17.656
Um, yeah, an-an insemination
and a pap. I got it.

09:17.658 --> 09:20.792
Should I...
No, I got... I got it.

09:26.799 --> 09:29.801
Allison:
Luisa, I messed up. I messed up.

09:29.803 --> 09:31.803
I love you.
I'm a screwed-up person.

09:31.805 --> 09:35.006
She means nothing to me,
I swear. I don't even care...

09:35.008 --> 09:37.576
(sighing)

09:40.146 --> 09:45.250
Nice to meet you,
ms. Villanueva.

09:45.252 --> 09:46.985
(snoring softly)

09:46.987 --> 09:49.688
Are you ready
for your insemination?

09:49.690 --> 09:52.857
Hi. Yes. I'm... Sorry.

09:52.859 --> 09:55.327
I'm a little tired. I'm jane.

09:55.329 --> 09:57.195
I usually see
dr. Peters...?

09:57.197 --> 10:00.332
Oh, I'll be filling in for her
while she's on her...

10:00.334 --> 10:03.101
Honeymoon...
(quiet sobbing breaths)

10:03.103 --> 10:05.370
Anyway, um, I'm dr. Alver.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.205
Are you okay?

10:07.207 --> 10:09.708
Oh, yeah, I'm fine. Um...

10:09.710 --> 10:12.677
Can you... Can you just
scoot down a little bit, please?

10:12.679 --> 10:13.945
(sighs)

10:13.947 --> 10:16.381
Um, did you... Did you
bring anyone with you?

10:16.383 --> 10:19.317
Here? No. Just me.

10:19.319 --> 10:22.354
Ah, you're doing it alone.
Good for you.

10:22.356 --> 10:24.623
(voice breaking):
It's probably easiest that way.

10:24.625 --> 10:26.291
(crying)

10:26.293 --> 10:28.994
Dr. Alver,
are you sure you're okay?

10:28.996 --> 10:30.662
(sniffles)
I'm sorry.

10:30.664 --> 10:31.997
I'm so sorry.

10:31.999 --> 10:33.932
Oh, my god,
this is so unprofessional.

10:33.934 --> 10:36.167
I'm...

10:36.169 --> 10:38.169
(groans loudly)

10:38.171 --> 10:41.873
I'm-I'm... I'm just going
through some personal problems.

10:41.875 --> 10:43.208
I'm sorry.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.676
I'm sorry...

10:44.678 --> 10:47.178
Hey, we all have 'em, right?

10:47.180 --> 10:49.748
Yeah, you know what?
Like, if you want me
to come back,

10:49.750 --> 10:51.082
Maybe I can just...
Oh, okay.

10:51.084 --> 10:53.084
You're starting.
No, because you'd have

10:53.086 --> 10:56.655
To wait a whole month,
and that's not fair to you.

10:56.657 --> 10:58.990
Okay. All done.

10:58.992 --> 11:01.426
You should get your results
in two weeks.

11:01.428 --> 11:03.928
That's it?

11:03.930 --> 11:06.031
That's it.

11:06.033 --> 11:11.803
Good luck, and again,
I'm... I'm so sorry for...

11:11.805 --> 11:13.238
No. No, it's okay.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.974
And I hope that everything
turns out okay for you.

11:15.976 --> 11:19.377
Yeah.

11:19.379 --> 11:21.446
(door closes)

11:23.449 --> 11:26.117
I didn't know
that you were coming.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.319
I had the nurse unfreeze
rafael's sperm.

11:28.321 --> 11:30.388
A surprise for him.

11:30.390 --> 11:31.856
That's why I didn't tell you.

11:31.858 --> 11:33.324
You guys are so close,

11:33.326 --> 11:35.093
I didn't want to put you
in an awkward position.

11:35.095 --> 11:38.229
Oh. I...

11:38.231 --> 11:41.066
Look, if you don't do it,
someone else will.

11:41.068 --> 11:42.734
And I know from the internet

11:42.736 --> 11:45.103
That you can't refreeze
the sample, so...

11:45.105 --> 11:46.971
Unless you want the sperm
to die...

11:46.973 --> 11:48.973
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And suddenly, just like that,</i>

11:48.975 --> 11:51.376
Luisa realized what she'd done.

11:51.378 --> 11:54.479
<i>But alas, it was too late.</i>

11:56.482 --> 12:00.018
<i>Jane's life was now the stuff</i>
<i>of telenovelas.</i>

12:08.360 --> 12:10.161
Latin love narrator: <i>Later, when</i>
<i>asked about the so-called</i>

12:10.163 --> 12:12.430
<i>"immaculate conception</i>
<i>of jane gloriana villanueva,"</i>

12:12.432 --> 12:14.165
<i>Luisa alver would say</i>

12:14.167 --> 12:16.835
That it was the biggest mistake
<i>of her life.</i>

12:16.837 --> 12:19.237
(knocking on door)

12:19.239 --> 12:21.206
Come in.

12:21.208 --> 12:23.274
Latin lover narrator:
<i>It wasn't.</i>

12:24.777 --> 12:28.913
I didn't know who else to call.

12:28.915 --> 12:30.782
You said it was an emergency?

12:30.784 --> 12:33.151
I artificially inseminated
the wrong woman,

12:33.153 --> 12:35.353
So... I need a lawyer.

12:35.355 --> 12:37.489
I don't practice law anymore.

12:37.491 --> 12:39.190
You know that.

12:39.192 --> 12:42.093
I am scared. I need someone
that I can talk to.

12:42.095 --> 12:44.462
Your wife, your brother.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.331
I walked in on allison
last night

12:46.333 --> 12:48.433
In bed with her assistant.

12:48.435 --> 12:51.336
I'm sorry that happened.

12:51.338 --> 12:55.774
And it was... Raf's sperm.

12:55.776 --> 12:57.108
What?!

12:57.110 --> 12:59.043
Petra came in
for an insemination,

12:59.045 --> 13:01.246
And I accidentally used
his specimen on

13:01.248 --> 13:03.882
<i>Someone named</i>
<i>jane gloriana villanueva.</i>

13:03.884 --> 13:05.517
Were you drinking?

13:05.519 --> 13:07.218
No.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.554
No. My god, no!

13:09.556 --> 13:11.422
I wasn't.

13:11.424 --> 13:13.224
What did you tell petra?

13:13.226 --> 13:15.126
I didn't. I panicked.

13:15.128 --> 13:18.263
I walked into the room, and
I inseminated her with saline.

13:19.398 --> 13:21.466
"you might be a father."

13:21.468 --> 13:24.135
We'll know in two weeks.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.837
I used your sample, baby.

13:25.839 --> 13:28.106
You what?!

13:28.108 --> 13:30.375
Without telling me?

13:30.377 --> 13:32.377
I wanted it to be romantic.

13:32.379 --> 13:34.379
I wanted some part of the fact

13:34.381 --> 13:37.882
That we had to do it
like this to...

13:37.884 --> 13:40.285
To be romantic.

13:43.355 --> 13:45.123
What are the chances
this will take?

13:45.125 --> 13:47.859
Twenty percent.

13:48.928 --> 13:51.262
Don't say anything.

13:51.264 --> 13:52.897
You're already on probation.

13:52.899 --> 13:54.465
You could lose your license.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.167
But what about raf?

13:56.169 --> 13:57.969
I mean, it was his only sample.

13:57.971 --> 13:59.604
And it's gone.

13:59.606 --> 14:01.372
How will telling him
change that?

14:12.384 --> 14:15.186
Jane:
Mom, stop staring.

14:17.022 --> 14:20.191
Come to my gig
tomorrow night, boo.

14:22.228 --> 14:23.528
Ah.

14:23.530 --> 14:25.163
(snickering)

14:25.165 --> 14:27.432
Don't you judge.

14:27.434 --> 14:30.134
The best way to get over a man
is to get under a new man.

14:30.136 --> 14:31.970
Trust.

14:31.972 --> 14:34.405
Well, as long as you're not
talking to bruce, I'm happy.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.107
Oh, man, you know
that guy darrell

14:36.109 --> 14:37.876
Who's dating
slutty crystal--

14:37.878 --> 14:39.978
Well, he found out that
she's been boning mauricio,

14:39.980 --> 14:41.913
But she tried to deny it,
but there was this text

14:41.915 --> 14:43.548
She sent him where she's, like,
naked and grabbing her boobs.

14:43.550 --> 14:45.250
You want to see?

14:45.252 --> 14:47.285
Pass.
I already sent it.

14:47.287 --> 14:48.653
You all right, baby?

14:48.655 --> 14:51.022
Fine. I'm just
a little nauseous.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.391
Wait. Why are you talking
to slutty crystal?

14:53.393 --> 14:55.593
I thought you hated her.
Yeah, I know, but
I just found out

14:55.595 --> 14:57.428
Her brother-in-law knows
paulina rubio's bassist,

14:57.430 --> 14:59.163
(phone chimes)
so I got to kiss her ass.

14:59.165 --> 15:01.032
Hopefully,
I don't get an std.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.268
Oh, mom, I did not
need to see...

15:03.270 --> 15:05.036
Crystal got fake boobs.

15:05.038 --> 15:07.605
Those are her
breakup boobs.
Hmm.

15:12.077 --> 15:13.444
Come on, let's get up.

15:13.446 --> 15:16.381
But you're not
feeling good.
Mom...

15:23.923 --> 15:26.291
Jane!

15:27.393 --> 15:28.927
Nausea and fainting spell
solved.

15:28.929 --> 15:30.495
You're pregnant.

15:30.497 --> 15:33.031
(both laugh)

15:33.033 --> 15:34.465
It's...

15:34.467 --> 15:36.534
I'm sorry, but she's
just not pregnant.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.269
No, I'm not pregnant.

15:38.271 --> 15:40.238
We tested your urine.
Jane:
Trust me,

15:40.240 --> 15:41.372
The test is wrong.

15:41.374 --> 15:42.707
False negatives are frequent,

15:42.709 --> 15:44.242
False positives are rare.

15:44.244 --> 15:46.144
Jane, did you
and michael...?

15:46.146 --> 15:47.578
No, we didn't.

15:47.580 --> 15:50.148
And it may be rare,
but it happened,

15:50.150 --> 15:51.549
'cause I'm a virgin.

15:51.551 --> 15:53.651
A virgin?
Yeah.

15:53.653 --> 15:56.654
Maybe we should talk in private.

15:56.656 --> 15:59.424
No. No, we don't need
to talk in private.
I think we do.

15:59.426 --> 16:00.491
Where did you get
your degree from,

16:00.493 --> 16:02.293
The university of dumb-ass?

16:02.295 --> 16:04.162
My daughter said that
she is a freakin' virgin,

16:04.164 --> 16:05.563
So do another damn test!

16:12.438 --> 16:15.039
Pink means pregnant.

16:19.078 --> 16:21.346
But I've never had sex!

16:21.348 --> 16:23.314
(gasps):
<i>Immaculata.</i>

16:23.316 --> 16:24.749
You are <i>immaculata.</i>

16:24.751 --> 16:26.184
What?

16:26.186 --> 16:28.086
No, mom.
Clearly, she's not a virgin.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.988
Of course I am!
That's a mistake.
(praying quietly)

16:29.990 --> 16:31.622
It's not a mistake.
Or it's a hormonal thing.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.124
Exactly, pregnancy hormones.
What?!

16:33.126 --> 16:34.459
I understand
that this is unplanned.

16:34.461 --> 16:36.127
Hail jane, full of grace...
Hi. Hello.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.196
This is jane villanueva.
I need to talk to dr. Alver,

16:38.198 --> 16:40.365
Because I have a crazy doctor
saying that I'm pregnant.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.367
Blessed is the
fruit of...
Shh!

16:42.369 --> 16:44.535
Of the womb!

16:50.676 --> 16:53.077
I'm not pregnant.
Just say it.

16:53.079 --> 16:55.146
No. You're not.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.781
I'm sorry.
No, lu.

16:56.783 --> 16:58.349
It's not your fault.

16:58.351 --> 17:01.419
Well, you see...
It is, actually.

17:01.421 --> 17:05.023
What do you mean?

17:05.025 --> 17:06.424
(sighs)

17:06.426 --> 17:09.293
Two weeks ago, when I walked in
on allison with...

17:09.295 --> 17:11.662
It doesn't matter.
Two weeks ago, um...

17:12.664 --> 17:15.333
I used your specimen
on the wrong person.

17:15.335 --> 17:18.269
Excuse me?
You what?!

17:18.271 --> 17:21.205
I inseminated a girl
with your sperm... Mistakenly.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.673
She's here.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.281
I had sex with bruce
three days ago.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.450
What?! Why are you
telling me this?

17:32.452 --> 17:34.485
I don't know. What if you're
like a religious messiah?

17:34.487 --> 17:36.454
I can't lie
to a religious messiah.

17:36.456 --> 17:39.757
Hey, there.
Jane:
Dr. Alver, hi.

17:39.759 --> 17:42.193
Thank you for seeing me.
It's the craziest thing, right?

17:42.195 --> 17:44.195
These pregnancy tests
keep coming back positive,

17:44.197 --> 17:45.830
And there's
got to a reason.

17:45.832 --> 17:47.698
Right? Like some kind
of hormonal thing or...

17:47.700 --> 17:50.701
There is a reason,
and the reason

17:50.703 --> 17:53.438
The tests came back
positive is...

17:53.440 --> 17:56.374
I accidentally
inseminated you two weeks ago.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.242
What?
You what?!

17:58.244 --> 18:00.511
It was a mistake.
I made a mistake.

18:00.513 --> 18:02.447
And there was only
a-a 20% chance

18:02.449 --> 18:05.349
That it would take,
so I-I thought

18:05.351 --> 18:08.219
That you would never know, but
things turned out differently.

18:12.858 --> 18:15.460
(gasping)

18:25.537 --> 18:30.842
(inhaling and exhaling deeply)

18:45.858 --> 18:48.392
Luisa:
I'm so sorry,

18:48.394 --> 18:50.528
Jane.
You're sorry?!

18:50.530 --> 18:52.196
You should be in jail, lady.
You should be locked up.

18:52.198 --> 18:54.332
Mom...
There's options.

18:54.334 --> 18:57.802
This is a prescription
for a pill that you could take.

18:57.804 --> 19:00.605
Um, of course,
you are under no obligation

19:00.607 --> 19:03.274
To consult with the father,
but he does know.

19:03.276 --> 19:05.409
The father.

19:05.411 --> 19:06.878
The father.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.379
Honey?

19:08.381 --> 19:10.781
I have to go.
Wait.

19:10.783 --> 19:12.884
No. I have to go.

19:12.886 --> 19:15.786
<i>(baby crying)</i>

19:15.788 --> 19:18.356
(crying)

19:29.368 --> 19:31.736
(breathing deeply)

19:38.277 --> 19:40.811
(knocking on door)

19:40.813 --> 19:43.281
One sec, babe.

19:43.283 --> 19:45.716
(sighs)

19:47.953 --> 19:50.288
Hey. You're a
little bit early.

19:50.290 --> 19:52.790
Yeah.

19:53.926 --> 19:55.927
Jane:
Oh...

19:55.929 --> 19:58.696
Hey, what's all this?
I thought we were going out?

19:58.698 --> 20:01.299
I made dinner.

20:01.301 --> 20:03.267
Grilled cheese.
(chuckles)

20:03.269 --> 20:06.437
That... Sounds perfect.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.873
Okay... Um, before we eat,

20:08.875 --> 20:10.875
I just want to give
you fair warning that

20:10.877 --> 20:14.312
I'm about to say some
pretty corny stuff.

20:14.314 --> 20:16.280
Okay, ground rules:

20:16.282 --> 20:17.982
Not allowed to freak out,
'cause this is a moment

20:17.984 --> 20:20.484
We're gonna be telling our kids
and grandkids about.

20:20.486 --> 20:22.486
Michael...

20:22.488 --> 20:23.988
What are you doing?

20:23.990 --> 20:25.323
I'm proposing.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.591
But, I mean...

20:26.593 --> 20:27.892
Our timeline.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.727
Who cares about the timeline?

20:29.729 --> 20:31.862
Or that, you know, you don't
have your teaching degree

20:31.864 --> 20:33.598
Or that I haven't
established my career,

20:33.600 --> 20:34.999
Or that we have debts,

20:35.001 --> 20:37.301
Or whatever other reasons
we have for waiting.

20:37.303 --> 20:40.471
As of today, we've been
together for two years.

20:40.473 --> 20:41.606
Michael, just...
Wait, wait, before
you say anything--

20:41.608 --> 20:43.608
I'm not doing this

20:43.610 --> 20:45.576
Because I want to have
sex with you, okay?

20:45.578 --> 20:47.778
I mean, I... I do want
to have sex with you,

20:47.780 --> 20:49.714
'cause two years is a
really, really long time,

20:49.716 --> 20:51.515
But that's not why
I'm proposing, okay?

20:51.517 --> 20:52.984
I'm proposing because

20:52.986 --> 20:55.019
I want to spend
my life with you.

20:55.021 --> 20:58.522
And raise children with you.

20:58.524 --> 20:59.857
And have sex with you.

20:59.859 --> 21:02.627
(chuckles)
so, jane...

21:02.629 --> 21:05.563
Gloriana villanueva, will...

21:05.565 --> 21:06.964
Will you...

21:06.966 --> 21:08.699
Michael, I'm pregnant.

21:09.401 --> 21:10.468
(box snaps shut)

21:14.773 --> 21:16.841
Latin lover narrator: <i>What will</i>
<i>serve michael cordero jr. Well</i>

21:16.843 --> 21:19.043
<i>In the illustrious detective</i>
<i>career he will go on to have</i>

21:19.045 --> 21:21.612
<i>Is his ability</i>
<i>to focus on facts.</i>

21:21.614 --> 21:24.315
Okay, I need you
to tell me again

21:24.317 --> 21:25.783
Everything that happened,
exactly as it happened.

21:25.785 --> 21:27.685
Going over how what happened
doesn't change the fact

21:27.687 --> 21:30.855
That it happened.

21:30.857 --> 21:32.490
I know. I know.
I'm just...

21:32.492 --> 21:34.825
I'm freaking out
a little bit here, babe.

21:34.827 --> 21:36.460
I know. Me, too.

21:36.462 --> 21:37.828
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And the fact was...</i>

21:37.830 --> 21:39.563
<i>This sucked.</i>

21:39.565 --> 21:43.434
(doorbell rings)
I invited over
our families.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.069
I was pretty sure
you'd say yes.

21:45.071 --> 21:47.605
Michael, I would have.

21:47.607 --> 21:49.473
Should we just
pretend like you did?

21:49.475 --> 21:50.808
For now?

21:50.810 --> 21:52.810
Yes.
(sighs)

21:52.812 --> 21:54.879
(doorbell rings)

21:58.850 --> 22:00.618
Probably shouldn't drink.

22:00.620 --> 22:03.954
I need another drink.

22:03.956 --> 22:07.658
I can't believe luisa
didn't tell you.

22:07.660 --> 22:10.528
Yeah.

22:10.530 --> 22:12.596
She's dead to me.

22:14.499 --> 22:16.534
I want it.

22:16.536 --> 22:18.469
The kid?

22:19.604 --> 22:21.872
An unexpected by-product
of cancer.

22:21.874 --> 22:24.041
They should put that
in the manual, right?

22:24.043 --> 22:26.677
Being told you can't have
kids will lead to you

22:26.679 --> 22:30.381
Really wanting them.

22:30.383 --> 22:32.616
Petra'll never go for it.

22:32.618 --> 22:35.086
Dude... This is the same girl
who would not leave your side

22:35.088 --> 22:36.954
When you were
going through chemo.

22:36.956 --> 22:39.090
I'm not gonna lie--
I thought she'd bolt.

22:39.092 --> 22:40.491
(both chuckle)

22:40.493 --> 22:41.759
Look, I'm just saying...

22:41.761 --> 22:43.828
Maybe you're
underestimating her.

22:46.965 --> 22:49.433
(all laughing)

22:49.435 --> 22:51.502
Thank you for coming.

22:57.042 --> 22:58.542
What are you doing here, man?

22:58.544 --> 23:00.778
Well, I got to admit--
I was hurt, you know?

23:00.780 --> 23:02.813
Not to get invited to my own
brother's engagement party.

23:02.815 --> 23:04.415
Oh,

23:04.417 --> 23:07.051
Well, I'm, uh, sorry
I hurt your feelings, billy.

23:07.053 --> 23:10.721
Uh-uh.
Don't treat me like that.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.890
Like what?
Like I'm a bomb

23:12.892 --> 23:14.492
That could go off.

23:14.494 --> 23:15.926
Which, uh... (chuckles)

23:15.928 --> 23:17.995
We know that I could, right?

23:17.997 --> 23:20.631
I mean, everybody here--

23:20.633 --> 23:21.999
Your fiancÃ©e--

23:22.001 --> 23:24.435
They think you're
such a good guy.

23:26.004 --> 23:27.671
Do not threaten me.

23:27.673 --> 23:28.806
Do you understand me?

23:29.808 --> 23:31.409
Do you understand me?

23:31.411 --> 23:32.910
Whoa, whoa, all right?

23:32.912 --> 23:36.147
Hey, look, I just came here
to, uh, congratulate you

23:36.149 --> 23:38.616
On your engagement,
that's all.

23:38.618 --> 23:42.553
So. Why don't you, um,
introduce me around.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.955
I met jane's mom.
Seems like a handful.

23:44.957 --> 23:46.690
Where's her pops?
Where's he?

23:46.692 --> 23:48.092
He's not a part
of her life.

23:48.094 --> 23:49.894
Oh, really?
Bet there's a story there.

23:49.896 --> 23:51.562
There's not a story.

23:51.564 --> 23:52.930
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Okay, here's the story:</i>

23:52.932 --> 23:55.633
<i>Jane has never met her father.</i>

23:55.635 --> 23:57.701
<i>In fact, xiomara herself</i>
<i>hadn't seen jane's father</i>

23:57.703 --> 23:59.703
<i>Since the day she told him</i>
<i>she was pregnant.</i>

23:59.705 --> 24:01.939
<i>The same day he told her</i>
<i>to get rid of it.</i>

24:01.941 --> 24:03.674
<i>Until 16 months ago,</i>

24:03.676 --> 24:05.810
<i>When she walked into</i>
<i>carla's croquetas...</i>

24:08.613 --> 24:11.682
...And saw jane's father again.

24:11.684 --> 24:13.751
Right there. In broad daylight.

24:21.726 --> 24:23.694
(knocking on door)

24:24.696 --> 24:25.996
Let's talk, janie.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.865
Mom, I'm not in the
mood, all right?

24:27.867 --> 24:30.534
I got a big test coming up,
I just want to study.

24:30.536 --> 24:32.803
But baby, I know
how you feel.

24:32.805 --> 24:35.239
I was 16 when I got pregnant
with you and I was so scared.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.942
You were irresponsible.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.144
You got pregnant because
you were irresponsible.

24:40.146 --> 24:41.779
I don't even have a dad.

24:41.781 --> 24:42.913
And I've done

24:42.915 --> 24:44.748
Everything right--
my whole life,

24:44.750 --> 24:48.118
I've tried to do everything
right so that I'd...

24:48.120 --> 24:50.588
So you won't turn out like me.

24:51.790 --> 24:54.091
I told you
I didn't want to talk.

24:56.561 --> 24:58.562
I got the prescription.

24:58.564 --> 25:00.030
In case.

25:02.667 --> 25:05.002
You don't have to have a baby.

25:06.104 --> 25:08.839
Would you have had me?

25:08.841 --> 25:10.875
Huh?

25:10.877 --> 25:13.777
If grandma hadn't made you?

25:17.949 --> 25:20.518
I'm glad I had you.

25:22.954 --> 25:26.090
That's not what I asked.

25:26.092 --> 25:29.026
Yeah, I know.

25:38.303 --> 25:41.038
Of course I want the baby.

25:41.040 --> 25:45.109
It's your child,
so it's my child.

25:45.111 --> 25:47.878
You look so surprised.

25:47.880 --> 25:50.281
I guess I am.

25:50.283 --> 25:51.982
A little.

25:53.318 --> 25:55.586
(ringtone plays)

25:55.588 --> 25:57.187
My sister has
to stop calling.

25:57.189 --> 25:59.089
I'll take care of it.

26:01.326 --> 26:03.294
Luisa, he really doesn't...

26:03.296 --> 26:05.996
Slow down. Slow down.

26:05.998 --> 26:08.566
Who works here?

26:15.140 --> 26:17.207
(clears her throat)

26:17.209 --> 26:20.244
Jane.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.947
The manager said
you wanted to see me?

26:22.949 --> 26:26.116
Look, I'm sorry that I called
you a jerk the other night.

26:26.118 --> 26:28.052
I was just
in this...
I'm the father.

26:28.054 --> 26:29.853
What?

26:29.855 --> 26:33.157
Of the baby
that you're carrying.

26:35.660 --> 26:38.862
And I'm sorry
about the other day, too.

26:38.864 --> 26:41.231
(breathing deeply)

26:45.670 --> 26:48.138
(sighs)

26:48.140 --> 26:51.675
I used to work at golden
harbor yacht club.

26:51.677 --> 26:54.845
That's where we know
each other from.

26:55.947 --> 26:58.782
Oh, yes.
No.

26:58.784 --> 26:59.984
I mean, you don't have
to act like you remember...

26:59.986 --> 27:02.386
No, no, I do. I remember.

27:02.388 --> 27:05.856
I-I came in, after tennis,

27:05.858 --> 27:08.692
<i>At the end of summer,</i>
<i>and the restaurant was closed.</i>

27:12.764 --> 27:13.964
<i>You let me in anyways,</i>

27:13.966 --> 27:15.766
<i>And you made me</i>

27:15.768 --> 27:19.169
<i>A killer</i>
<i>grilled cheese sandwich.</i>

27:19.171 --> 27:21.105
One-third white cheddar,
one-third yellow cheddar,

27:21.107 --> 27:22.906
One-third grated american.

27:22.908 --> 27:24.742
(sighs)

27:24.744 --> 27:26.977
And then we talked.

27:28.046 --> 27:29.747
Mm-hmm.
<i>Well, it depends.</i>

27:29.749 --> 27:32.182
Am I being practical or brave?

27:32.184 --> 27:34.418
Practical.

27:34.420 --> 27:36.120
I'm a teacher.

27:36.122 --> 27:38.989
Brave.

27:38.991 --> 27:41.025
I'm a writer?

27:41.027 --> 27:44.061
I have never said that
out loud before.

27:44.063 --> 27:45.329
(chuckles)

27:45.331 --> 27:48.132
Be brave.

27:52.337 --> 27:54.772
<i>And I never called.</i>

27:54.774 --> 27:57.007
I was kind of a jerk back then.

27:57.009 --> 27:58.809
It was a long time ago.

27:58.811 --> 28:00.411
Still...

28:00.413 --> 28:03.080
I'm sorry.

28:06.117 --> 28:07.985
I'm not ready to be a mom.

28:07.987 --> 28:10.754
We'd take it.
And then what?

28:10.756 --> 28:12.089
I live the rest
of my life knowing

28:12.091 --> 28:14.024
That my kid is
just out there?

28:15.093 --> 28:17.161
So...

28:19.397 --> 28:21.165
You're not gonna have it?

28:22.967 --> 28:25.102
Look, I know that the reasons

28:25.104 --> 28:28.238
For me wanting to end
the pregnancy are so selfish,

28:28.240 --> 28:30.708
That I'm not ready,
that this wasn't the plan,

28:30.710 --> 28:32.843
That I have worked so hard
every second

28:32.845 --> 28:34.912
So that my life was different
than my mother's.

28:34.914 --> 28:37.848
I was an accident,

28:37.850 --> 28:40.250
And I know my mom loves me.

28:42.053 --> 28:43.987
But I also know that
in some ways,

28:43.989 --> 28:46.156
I derailed her life.

28:46.158 --> 28:49.760
I don't want my kid
to feel like that.

28:49.762 --> 28:51.829
Ever.

28:54.899 --> 28:56.967
I want to be ready.

28:59.871 --> 29:01.939
Yeah.

29:04.743 --> 29:07.444
That makes sense.

29:07.446 --> 29:09.246
You didn't drop the cancer card?

29:09.248 --> 29:10.848
The-the cancer card?

29:10.850 --> 29:12.282
Oh, stop. You know what I mean.

29:12.284 --> 29:14.351
Did you tell her
that this was your only chance

29:14.353 --> 29:16.019
To have a biological child?

29:16.021 --> 29:17.287
She was upset.

29:17.289 --> 29:18.422
I'm not just gonna make her...

29:18.424 --> 29:19.823
Oh, give me a break.

29:19.825 --> 29:22.192
(mouthing)

29:22.194 --> 29:24.161
Fine.

29:24.163 --> 29:27.131
Latin lover narrator:
<i>Petra was always good at math.</i>

29:27.133 --> 29:28.999
<i>According to her</i>
<i>precise calculations</i>

29:29.001 --> 29:34.138
<i>And her equally precise</i>
<i>prenuptial agreement...</i>

29:34.140 --> 29:35.873
(cash register bell dings)

29:35.875 --> 29:37.908
I'll be the bad guy
if that's what this is about.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.409
No, no, it's not.

29:39.411 --> 29:40.944
You know what,
don't do anything,

29:40.946 --> 29:42.212
Don't say anything.

29:42.214 --> 29:44.481
I mean it.

29:44.483 --> 29:46.550
We'll talk later.

29:55.426 --> 29:58.428
Oh, <i>abuela,</i> it is not
what you think.

30:00.031 --> 30:02.232
No, I didn't. I...

30:02.234 --> 30:05.269
I got accidentally...

30:05.271 --> 30:07.571
Oh, I don't even know how
to say this in spanish.

30:09.174 --> 30:10.240
No, no, I didn't.

30:10.242 --> 30:11.809
The doctor made a mistake.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.811
I went to the appointment
and she...

30:13.813 --> 30:16.480
Accidentally... Put...

30:16.482 --> 30:20.117
A sample of a man into me.

30:22.520 --> 30:24.054
Yes.

30:24.056 --> 30:26.423
From his...

30:28.159 --> 30:30.828
(gasps)
oh.

30:39.204 --> 30:40.537
<i>Abuela,</i> please.

30:40.539 --> 30:42.506
No, but I know
how you feel...

30:53.952 --> 30:55.419
What?!

31:19.177 --> 31:22.045
Luisa, it's petra.

31:22.047 --> 31:23.547
I need your help.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.415
And in exchange,
I'll convince your brother

31:25.417 --> 31:27.985
Not to report you
to the medical board.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.891
You're early.

31:33.893 --> 31:36.894
Yeah, I just...
I got called into work.
Oh.

31:36.896 --> 31:39.296
Yeah, so I just
wanted to come by

31:39.298 --> 31:42.299
And talk to you real quick,
in person, you know?

31:42.301 --> 31:45.168
Yeah, of course.

31:45.170 --> 31:47.037
Janie...

31:47.039 --> 31:49.206
I want to say that I'll
support you no matter what...

31:49.208 --> 31:50.407
Oh.
Wait, wait.

31:50.409 --> 31:51.441
That's...

31:51.443 --> 31:52.609
That's what I want to say.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.478
But that's not how I feel.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.314
I want to start
a life with you.

31:57.316 --> 31:58.682
And I don't want to start it

31:58.684 --> 32:00.317
With you having
some other guy's kid.

32:00.319 --> 32:02.452
And I'm sorry
if that makes me a bad person,

32:02.454 --> 32:04.121
But that's how I feel.

32:05.623 --> 32:07.624
Please.

32:07.626 --> 32:10.160
For us.

32:10.162 --> 32:13.330
Don't have this baby.

32:15.366 --> 32:17.434
(sighs)

32:18.536 --> 32:20.704
Okay.

32:37.221 --> 32:41.291
(singing in spanish)

32:47.031 --> 32:49.132
Latin lover narrator: <i>After her</i>
<i>teenage boyfriend rogelio</i>

32:49.134 --> 32:51.335
<i>Told her not to have the baby,</i>

32:51.337 --> 32:52.669
<i>Xiomara had a real problem.</i>

32:52.671 --> 32:54.404
<i>She knew she wanted the baby,</i>

32:54.406 --> 32:57.541
<i>But she also knew</i>
<i>she did not want rogelio.</i>

32:57.543 --> 32:58.742
It's true.

32:58.744 --> 33:01.178
I'm pregnant.

33:06.384 --> 33:07.651
Some army guy.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.988
I didn't get
his last name.

33:10.990 --> 33:13.657
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And so xiomara kept</i>

33:13.659 --> 33:16.393
<i>Jane's father's identity</i>
<i>a secret.</i>

33:16.395 --> 33:18.996
(singing in spanish)

33:32.243 --> 33:34.311
(patrons cheering)

33:38.549 --> 33:40.650
Yeah!

33:40.652 --> 33:42.085
(whoops)

33:44.255 --> 33:47.758
Abuela asked me to never
tell you what she said, and I...

33:47.760 --> 33:52.062
I didn't want you
to look at her differently.

33:52.064 --> 33:54.631
Look at you, being all selfless.

33:54.633 --> 33:56.500
But no more secrets.

33:56.502 --> 33:58.168
Okay?

34:00.706 --> 34:03.540
That you had a choice,
because having one--

34:03.542 --> 34:04.775
It helps, I think.

34:06.411 --> 34:09.413
Whatever you decide.

34:10.581 --> 34:14.051
I don't know what to do, mom.

34:14.053 --> 34:15.719
Michael doesn't want it.

34:15.721 --> 34:19.189
And I get why, of...
Of course I get why.

34:19.191 --> 34:20.590
But dr. Alver called

34:20.592 --> 34:22.192
And said that the father...

34:23.327 --> 34:26.463
...Rafael, he had cancer.

34:26.465 --> 34:28.198
This is his only sample,

34:28.200 --> 34:30.333
And he and his wife,
they're this great couple,

34:30.335 --> 34:31.735
Loving and wonderful,

34:31.737 --> 34:33.603
And all they want is a child.

34:33.605 --> 34:35.739
You want a divorce?

34:35.741 --> 34:37.340
I do.

34:37.342 --> 34:40.243
I took care of you
when you were sick.

34:40.245 --> 34:42.379
Which is why I didn't
do this a year ago.

34:42.381 --> 34:45.515
And I think, if you're
being honest, you knew that.

34:45.517 --> 34:47.584
I also think it's the reason
you used my sample.

34:51.556 --> 34:53.557
And regardless...

34:53.559 --> 34:56.126
I think we bring out
an ugly side in each other.

34:56.128 --> 34:58.095
Don't you think?

35:11.275 --> 35:12.709
Nothing, sir.

35:12.711 --> 35:15.145
We had some girl come
in there, she took off.

35:15.147 --> 35:17.347
Zazo's the contact.

35:17.349 --> 35:19.182
I'm positive.

35:21.152 --> 35:23.286
I.D. The girl.

35:23.288 --> 35:25.689
Already sent the images
down to the station.

35:30.161 --> 35:31.628
(camera shutter clicks)

35:31.630 --> 35:34.264
â™ª

35:36.701 --> 35:38.235
Doctor:
<i>Pink means pregnant.</i>

35:38.237 --> 35:39.836
But I've never had sex.

35:39.838 --> 35:41.905
â™ª

35:46.244 --> 35:47.477
You don't have to have a baby.

35:47.479 --> 35:49.913
We'd take it.

35:51.782 --> 35:53.216
Michael:
<i>Please...</i>

35:54.385 --> 35:56.453
For us.

35:56.455 --> 35:57.854
Don't have this baby.

36:09.534 --> 36:12.302
Some guy's here to see you, xo.

36:12.304 --> 36:14.337
If it's bruce,
tell him I'm serious,

36:14.339 --> 36:15.572
I don't want to see him.

36:15.574 --> 36:16.806
Man:
It's not bruce.

36:25.683 --> 36:27.751
(romantic spanish music
playing on tv)

36:28.953 --> 36:31.288
Customer:
Could I get some help, here?

36:31.290 --> 36:32.455
Waitress:
Sorry.

36:32.457 --> 36:33.723
It's this new show.

36:33.725 --> 36:35.292
(laughs)

36:35.294 --> 36:37.561
(speaking spanish)

36:43.868 --> 36:46.336
How could you keep my daughter
a secret all these years?

36:46.338 --> 36:47.871
I wrote you 16 months ago!

36:47.873 --> 36:49.306
What took you so long?

36:51.576 --> 36:53.944
â™ª

37:05.523 --> 37:07.657
(officers wolf-whistling,
whooping)

37:07.659 --> 37:10.260
(whooping, laughing)

37:18.669 --> 37:20.837
Babe...

37:20.839 --> 37:22.973
What are you
doing here?

37:22.975 --> 37:24.808
Trying to be brave.

37:24.810 --> 37:27.477
But before I propose...

37:27.479 --> 37:29.646
(officers whooping, laughing)

37:29.648 --> 37:31.615
...You need to know
all the facts.

37:31.617 --> 37:33.516
And the fact is,

37:33.518 --> 37:34.718
I'm having the baby.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.320
(officers exclaim, murmur)

37:37.322 --> 37:38.688
And we're giving
it to the father.

37:38.690 --> 37:40.523
He and his wife,
they really want it.

37:40.525 --> 37:42.559
And they're
a really great couple.

37:42.561 --> 37:44.527
She's giving us the baby?

37:44.529 --> 37:45.762
Yes.

37:45.764 --> 37:47.631
She just called.

37:47.633 --> 37:50.033
She said she wants it
to grow up in a happy home,

37:50.035 --> 37:51.801
Where both parents want it.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.840
So, under the circumstances,
I thought it best not to mention

37:56.842 --> 37:58.908
Our previous conversation.

38:00.578 --> 38:02.846
Jane:
<i>Michael?</i>

38:04.548 --> 38:06.283
Yeah.

38:07.418 --> 38:09.953
Okay.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.955
I'm okay with that.

38:11.957 --> 38:14.491
(gasps, laughs)

38:14.493 --> 38:15.692
Okay.

38:15.694 --> 38:16.960
(whoops)
oh...

38:16.962 --> 38:18.428
That's not good.
You can stand.

38:18.430 --> 38:19.796
Oh, can I?
Great, thanks.

38:19.798 --> 38:21.531
Okay.

38:21.533 --> 38:22.832
All right.
Oh...

38:22.834 --> 38:24.034
I'm not good at this stuff.

38:24.036 --> 38:25.802
(clears throat)

38:25.804 --> 38:28.938
So instead of telling you
the reasons why I love you,

38:28.940 --> 38:31.474
I'm gonna tell you
the reasons why I don't.

38:33.411 --> 38:35.078
I don't love you...

38:35.080 --> 38:37.047
Because you're smart

38:37.049 --> 38:39.516
And kind.

38:39.518 --> 38:41.518
I don't love you
because you're hard-working

38:41.520 --> 38:43.320
And competitive

38:43.322 --> 38:45.055
And way too defensive.
I'm not defensive.

38:45.057 --> 38:46.723
(officers laughing)

38:46.725 --> 38:50.393
I don't love you because
you are incredibly sexy.

38:50.395 --> 38:51.961
Ooh!
(laughter)

38:51.963 --> 38:54.597
(jane laughs)

38:57.868 --> 39:00.470
I love you because
you're my best friend.

39:02.707 --> 39:04.541
And I want to grow old with you.

39:06.110 --> 39:07.877
And right now,

39:07.879 --> 39:11.781
I'm confused about every
single thing in my life...

39:11.783 --> 39:14.617
Except you.

39:14.619 --> 39:16.886
Wow.

39:16.888 --> 39:18.521
I love you.

39:18.523 --> 39:20.890
(officers applauding, cheering)

39:20.892 --> 39:22.692
Latin lover narrator:
<i>And in that moment,</i>

39:22.694 --> 39:26.029
<i>In the arms of the man</i>
<i>she thought she knew so well,</i>

39:26.031 --> 39:28.365
<i>Jane gloriana villanueva</i>

39:28.367 --> 39:30.834
<i>Really believed that</i>
<i>to be true.</i>

39:30.836 --> 39:34.437
And then... Everything changed.
