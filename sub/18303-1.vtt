- (Clunking noise)
- Who's there?

01:00.018 --> 01:01.019
(Clunking noise)

01:13.907 --> 01:15.375
(Rustling sound)

01:51.987 --> 01:53.079
(Dial tone) 'Glenn's Falls
Police Department.'

01:53.196 --> 01:55.449
This Dr. Lifflander.
I want someone to...

01:55.574 --> 01:56.996
(Rattling noise)

02:16.678 --> 02:20.649
Hello. Can you send
someone to... Hello! Hello!

02:21.642 --> 02:23.394
God.
(Rattling noise continues)

02:37.324 --> 02:40.328
- (Glass breaks)
- (Heavy breathing)

02:51.630 --> 02:54.509
Oh, God. No, no.

02:54.633 --> 02:58.012
(Banging noises)

02:59.805 --> 03:03.059
- (Heavy breathing)
- I've got a gun.

03:03.183 --> 03:06.107
I'll shoot.
Get out, or I'll shoot.

03:10.273 --> 03:12.742
(Gunshots)

03:26.331 --> 03:28.174
(Screams)

03:29.543 --> 03:31.716
(Guttural noise)

03:34.965 --> 03:36.967
(Screaming continues)

04:08.957 --> 04:11.927
Smokes. I got joints and bags.
Nickel and dime bags.

04:12.043 --> 04:13.716
Gold Colombia smoke.

04:13.837 --> 04:17.512
I got acid, blotters, rainbows,
windowpanes, speed, downs,

04:17.632 --> 04:20.305
Seconal, Valium, mescaline, THC.

04:20.427 --> 04:23.601
I've got some good cocaine.
Quaaludes. Beauties. Methergine.

04:23.722 --> 04:26.521
Cheap Panama red. Angel dust.
Check it out, man.

04:26.641 --> 04:29.941
Tranquilizers, anabuse,
lithium, Thai sticks.

04:30.061 --> 04:32.655
Methadone, rock red,
junk, morphine.

04:32.773 --> 04:33.740
What you want, some girls?

04:33.857 --> 04:36.736
I got some nice... What the fuck
is wrong with you anyway, man?

04:54.628 --> 04:57.097
He saw him with Dirty Lou.
You remember him.

04:57.214 --> 04:59.057
He looks like Sparkle
in the comics.

04:59.174 --> 05:02.849
Dirty Lou, Dirty Lou.
The name sounds so familiar.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.721
Wait a minute.
Did he get run over?

05:04.846 --> 05:06.894
It was suicide.
He hailed a cab.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.643
When it pulled up to the curb,
he jump in front of us.

05:09.768 --> 05:12.021
Get out of here.
You're full of crap.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.648
Com p8 "Y-

05:14.773 --> 05:17.151
- I'd like a room.
- For how long?

05:17.275 --> 05:18.948
I'm not sure.

05:19.069 --> 05:20.946
Couple of hours.
Couple of years, what?

05:21.071 --> 05:22.072
Give me a hint.

05:22.197 --> 05:24.416
- A few days.
- You by yourself?

05:24.533 --> 05:26.206
Yes, alone. By myself.

05:26.326 --> 05:31.503
All alone
in this cold, cruel world.

05:31.623 --> 05:34.467
2O bucks at night. In advance.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.884
And if you pay by the day,
it's due at noon.

05:38.004 --> 05:38.971
And I don't want
no junkies in here,

05:39.089 --> 05:41.512
because this is
a respectable hotel.

05:41.633 --> 05:43.635
I just need a place to stay.

05:45.095 --> 05:47.018
- What's in the basket?
- Clothes.

05:47.138 --> 05:48.890
He's smuggling in
a case of booze.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.143
He's going to throw us a party.

05:55.313 --> 05:58.442
- Room 7. Third floor.
- Great.

05:58.567 --> 06:00.114
2O bucks.

06:00.235 --> 06:02.954
Oh. Right. Um.

06:20.630 --> 06:22.598
- This stuff real?
- Huh?

06:31.057 --> 06:34.687
- Did you see that? He's loaded.
- So are you.

06:42.402 --> 06:45.781
Hi, I'm Josephine.
What room are you in?

06:45.906 --> 06:48.125
- Seven.
- Oh, you're so lucky.

06:48.241 --> 06:50.369
That's the best room
in the place.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.166
It was lived in
by a little old lady

06:52.287 --> 06:53.789
who only went out on Sundays.

06:53.914 --> 06:55.086
She lived there for ages.

06:55.206 --> 06:56.674
Used to tell everyone
she was rich.

06:56.791 --> 06:58.043
Owned oil wells in Texas.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.512
Had millions and was hiding
from her relatives

07:00.629 --> 07:02.302
who were trying
to steal it from her.

07:02.422 --> 07:04.550
She'd creep up to you and say,

07:04.674 --> 07:07.018
"They're trying to take
my money,

07:07.135 --> 07:10.560
"but they don't know
where I am."

07:10.680 --> 07:13.274
Oh, everyone though
she was nuts.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.517
Then one day,

07:14.643 --> 07:17.522
she appeared in the lobby
dressed in furs and jewels.

07:17.646 --> 07:19.614
Said she was leaving
to tour the world.

07:19.731 --> 07:22.951
She paid her bill and left.
No one's heard from her since.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.546
We're here.

09:00.206 --> 09:02.379
Is there any place I can get
something to eat around here?

09:02.500 --> 09:04.002
Nothing too fancy, I hope.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.879
- No, just pizza or burgers...
- Yeah, plenty.

09:06.004 --> 09:07.631
There's one right
across the street.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.053
Great, thanks.

09:40.705 --> 09:42.298
Got you something to eat.

09:46.878 --> 09:48.596
(Chewing loudly)

09:48.713 --> 09:50.511
Take your time, there's plenty.

09:50.632 --> 09:52.634
(Chewing continues)

10:27.460 --> 10:29.133
Finished already?

10:32.507 --> 10:34.555
(Grunting)

10:42.600 --> 10:45.399
Damn.
Kutter's name isn't listed.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.573
Well, Needleman
must have the number.

11:31.816 --> 11:34.444
You're not going to pace
the floor all night, are you?

11:39.365 --> 11:43.211
No I don't want to talk now.
Go back to sleep.

11:46.664 --> 11:50.043
Oh, come on.
Gotta get up early.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.715
Yeah. Yeah.

11:54.839 --> 11:57.718
We've been through
this before, you know.

11:57.842 --> 12:00.595
Look, I'm not going to stay up
half the night talking.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.519
It's 3:30 in the morning.
Go back to sleep.

12:10.313 --> 12:13.692
I'm not going to debate this.
Now good night.

12:22.116 --> 12:26.246
For Chrissake, shut up
and let me get some sleep.

12:26.371 --> 12:27.714
(Sighs) Always waits

12:27.830 --> 12:30.549
until I'm asleep
to start a conversation.

13:11.833 --> 13:14.507
(Door opens and creaks)

13:34.105 --> 13:35.482
Oh great.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.608
Last week you were
in the dumb waiter.

13:37.734 --> 13:39.236
This week it's keyholes.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.327
Shh.

13:40.445 --> 13:42.368
- There's somebody in there.
- Well, I figured that.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.832
You should see. He's got
a lot of bills. Like this.

13:44.949 --> 13:46.701
Oh, give me a break.

13:46.826 --> 13:49.079
He's carrying them around loose.
In his... in his pocket.

13:49.203 --> 13:52.833
You've got two seconds before
I start pounding on his door.

13:52.957 --> 13:53.924
No, wait, wait.

13:54.042 --> 13:55.965
- One...
- I'm going, I'm going.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.758
Keyhole peek.

13:57.879 --> 14:00.007
Cockroaches as big
as big as dogs.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.884
Saxophones playing at
four o'clock in the morning,

14:03.009 --> 14:05.762
and that crazy broad
across the hall.

14:05.887 --> 14:09.858
Winos pissing on my doorstep.
I mean...

14:16.022 --> 14:17.740
Just a minute.

14:26.074 --> 14:28.076
Hi. I live across the hall.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.669
Well, the reason
I'm bothering you is...

14:29.786 --> 14:30.753
I don't what you to think

14:30.870 --> 14:32.588
I go round butting
into people's business.

14:32.705 --> 14:34.799
But somebody's been
snooping around your door.

14:34.916 --> 14:37.010
You know, peeking through
the keyhole and shit.

14:37.126 --> 14:38.799
So if you've got anything
of value in there,

14:38.920 --> 14:40.012
like money or something,

14:40.129 --> 14:42.348
I wouldn't leave it
laying around.

14:42.465 --> 14:43.808
Right. Sure.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.394
I can't stand to see
somebody get ripped off,

14:46.511 --> 14:48.263
especially without
a fighting chance.

14:48.388 --> 14:51.016
- My name's Casey.
- Dwayne Bradley.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.983
Nice meeting you,
Dwayne Bradley.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.103
What the hell you
doing in this dump?

14:55.228 --> 14:57.481
It was the first hotel
I came to.

14:57.605 --> 15:00.859
Obviously a hard man to please.
Where you from?

15:00.983 --> 15:04.032
- Upstate.
- Oh. First time in New York?

15:04.153 --> 15:05.075
Yeah.

15:05.196 --> 15:06.288
Listen, let's go
for a drink sometime.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.704
- OK, sure.
- Catch you later, kid. Bye.

15:26.634 --> 15:27.977
C'mon, we got to pay
a little visit

15:28.094 --> 15:30.142
to a doctor friend of ours.

16:11.846 --> 16:14.099
So the drugstore said
he never should've prescribed it

16:14.223 --> 16:15.645
to me in the first place.

16:15.766 --> 16:18.394
It's the wrong drug.
I'm allergic to it.

16:18.519 --> 16:21.489
That's terrible.
Does he know you're allergic?

16:21.606 --> 16:23.404
Well, he should.
It's the second time

16:23.524 --> 16:24.741
he gave me
the wrong prescription.

16:24.859 --> 16:26.657
The first time was just as bad.

16:26.777 --> 16:28.825
Oh, my goodness.

16:28.946 --> 16:31.369
I'll be right with you.
It's this typewriter.

16:31.491 --> 16:33.664
It looked terrible.

16:33.784 --> 16:38.039
First I got dizzy,
then I couldn't breathe,

16:38.164 --> 16:40.792
then my throat felt
like it was on fire.

16:40.917 --> 16:44.217
Well, you make sure
and tell all this to the doctor.

16:46.756 --> 16:48.554
(Murmuring) Give me
the wrong prescription.

16:52.887 --> 16:55.390
OK. This is the one.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.893
- (Buzzing)
- Hear that?

16:58.017 --> 17:00.861
Sounds like something
grinding inside?

17:00.978 --> 17:05.733
And the carriage won't return.
Yesterday it was squeaking,

17:05.858 --> 17:08.031
like if a mouse
was caught inside.

17:08.152 --> 17:09.904
Real high-pitched.

17:10.029 --> 17:13.532
Like, ring-ring-ring,
ring-ring-ring...

17:13.657 --> 17:15.877
I don't know anything
about typewriters.

17:15.992 --> 17:18.337
I just want to see the doctor.

17:19.789 --> 17:21.132
Oh, my goodness. I'm sorry.

17:21.249 --> 17:22.842
I just assumed.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.757
Well, I didn't think
you were a patient.

17:24.877 --> 17:27.972
I'm expecting someone to fix
the typewriter this afternoon,

17:28.089 --> 17:32.640
and I just thought...
I figured that was your toolbox.

17:32.760 --> 17:35.388
Doctor Needleman's
an old friend of the family.

17:35.513 --> 17:38.187
Is there any chance I could
see him without an appointment?

17:38.307 --> 17:41.857
He'd tell you no,
friend of the family or not.

17:41.978 --> 17:43.230
But as you can see,

17:43.354 --> 17:46.324
we have hundreds of patients
waiting to see him,

17:46.440 --> 17:49.159
so we'll just pretend
you did call

17:49.277 --> 17:52.702
and have an appointment
for 11:30.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.289
- You're next.
- Thanks.

17:57.410 --> 17:59.833
- What's your name?
- Dwayne Bradley.

17:59.954 --> 18:01.797
Oh, don't write that.

18:01.914 --> 18:06.385
I want to surprise him, and he'd
recognize that name right away.

18:06.502 --> 18:09.597
Put down something like Smith.
Dwayne Smith.

18:09.714 --> 18:13.184
He'll appreciate this.
He's a million laughs.

18:14.552 --> 18:16.850
OK, and you fill out the rest.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.198
What's in the basket?
Easter eggs?

18:37.241 --> 18:41.121
(Clears throat)
Just visiting New York, or...

18:41.245 --> 18:43.498
Yeah, this is my first time.

18:43.623 --> 18:45.842
So have you gone
to the Empire State Building yet

18:45.958 --> 18:47.050
and the Statue of Liberty?

18:47.168 --> 18:51.048
- No, I haven't had the time.
- Haven't had the time?

18:51.172 --> 18:54.267
Well, what about Radio
City Music Hall or the UN?

18:54.383 --> 18:57.887
- Had time for them?
- No, I, I...

18:58.012 --> 18:59.810
What about
the World Trade Towers?

18:59.930 --> 19:01.307
Or the trolley cars?

19:01.432 --> 19:03.105
It's not
that I don't want to, but...

19:03.225 --> 19:05.819
The Met. The Cloisters.
Scrummage Chinese.

19:05.936 --> 19:09.110
It's just that
I don't know where anything is.

19:09.231 --> 19:12.110
Well, if you need a tour guide,
I'd be happy to volunteer.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.624
We'll even buy you
some 3D postcards

19:17.740 --> 19:19.458
and an 'I Love New York' T-shirt.

19:19.575 --> 19:21.669
(Murmuring)

19:23.204 --> 19:24.751
You're next.

19:35.508 --> 19:38.057
Come in. Mr...

19:39.178 --> 19:40.145
Smith.

19:42.556 --> 19:43.603
Smith.

19:48.229 --> 19:51.073
Mr. Smith.
What seems to be the problem?

19:51.190 --> 19:54.069
My chest.
I've got this pain and...

19:54.193 --> 19:55.194
Uh-huh.

19:55.319 --> 19:57.697
Well, why don't want you
put whatever that is down.

19:57.822 --> 20:00.792
Take off your shirt,
step in there. Have a seat.

20:42.032 --> 20:45.707
So? What did he give you,
48 hours to live?

20:45.828 --> 20:47.922
No, we just had a nice chat.

20:48.038 --> 20:52.088
- Was he surprised?
- Oh yeah.

20:52.209 --> 20:53.506
<i>VET'!-</i>

20:53.627 --> 20:56.927
Anyway, getting back to what
we were talking about before,

20:57.047 --> 21:00.426
I get off here
tonight here at 7:00.

21:00.551 --> 21:05.352
- Hint, hint.
- Well, I'd like to.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.942
But I can't. Not tonight.

21:10.519 --> 21:12.772
Can't say I didn't try.

21:23.657 --> 21:26.911
- May I call you tomorrow?
- 233-3000.

21:27.036 --> 21:28.379
He doesn't have
hours on Wednesday.

21:28.496 --> 21:29.998
I have the whole day free.

21:30.122 --> 21:32.921
- (Whispers) Where do you live?
- I'll write it down.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.637
It's all the way downtown.

21:38.506 --> 21:41.055
- Why are we whispering?
- I don't want him to hear.

21:41.175 --> 21:43.928
- Who? The doctor?
- I'll see you later.

22:09.995 --> 22:10.996
Levlander.

23:04.091 --> 23:07.061
(Gunshots from screen)

23:36.373 --> 23:39.172
Not now. Not yet.

23:41.211 --> 23:43.964
Save it. Save it.

24:11.742 --> 24:14.211
(Dial tone)

24:53.742 --> 24:57.622
- Mm. That was delicious.
- So are you.

24:57.746 --> 25:01.216
- Come on, have some more.
- No, really.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.334
I've had enough.

25:02.459 --> 25:04.837
Nonsense. we're just beginning.

25:04.962 --> 25:08.216
Listen, if I have anymore,
I will...

25:08.340 --> 25:09.842
- I'm liable to...
- That's alright.

25:09.967 --> 25:14.017
I like you drunk.
You're cute when you slobber.

25:14.138 --> 25:16.516
- (Phone ringing)
- Shit.

25:18.183 --> 25:20.060
Excuse me for a minute, love.

25:30.904 --> 25:33.828
- Doctor Kutter speaking.
- This is Needleman.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.873
Who? Harold...

25:36.994 --> 25:38.792
I thought I made it clear

25:38.912 --> 25:41.040
you weren't to call me again. Ever

25:41.165 --> 25:44.294
You remember Lifflander?
From Glenn's Falls?

25:44.418 --> 25:47.467
Well, a few days ago, he left a
message on my answering service

25:47.588 --> 25:49.261
that I urgently
get in touch with him.

25:49.381 --> 25:51.258
- So?
- So.

25:51.383 --> 25:54.762
So today, a young man
comes to see me.

25:54.887 --> 25:57.310
About 20 years old,
using a phony name,

25:57.431 --> 25:59.854
and nothing's wrong with him
except he's from Glenn's Falls,

25:59.975 --> 26:02.774
and he has a deep scar
running down his right side.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.148
Please, Harold,
I'm in the middle of dinner.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.616
What he said about Lifflander,
I've been trying to get him

26:07.733 --> 26:09.531
and I get no answer,
and this kid says

26:09.651 --> 26:11.403
it's because
Lifflander is dead.

26:11.528 --> 26:13.906
Murdered! Cut in half.

26:14.031 --> 26:16.625
Calm down now, Harold,
and pay attention.

26:16.742 --> 26:17.834
Ready?

26:17.951 --> 26:20.704
Neither of us know
any Doctor Lifflander

26:20.829 --> 26:23.548
and neither of us have ever been
in Glenn's Falls,

26:23.665 --> 26:27.169
but one of us wants to get back
to her dinner. Good night.

26:30.380 --> 26:34.135
- Sorry about that, cuddles.
- Now, where were we?

27:14.258 --> 27:16.477
Are you leaving now,
or should I lock up'?

27:16.593 --> 27:18.891
No, no.
I'll be a while.

27:19.012 --> 27:22.186
But, uh, go on
and lock up anyway.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.730
OK, see you on Thursday.

27:40.492 --> 27:41.493
(Door closes)

28:21.783 --> 28:24.252
She just left.
He's in there alone.

28:45.933 --> 28:46.934
(Thud)

28:53.815 --> 28:55.613
Don't forget the address book.

28:56.944 --> 28:59.993
- (Heavy breathing)
- Hurry up, I'll be outside.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.767
(Banging noise)

32:32.075 --> 32:34.077
(Heavy breathing)

32:37.914 --> 32:40.463
Did you get his address book?

32:40.584 --> 32:42.052
Great.

32:44.212 --> 32:45.589
Kutter's listed.
He's got her address.

32:45.714 --> 32:46.931
We're in luck.

33:16.786 --> 33:18.504
I brought you some goodies.

33:21.708 --> 33:24.086
But first, breakfast.

33:33.303 --> 33:35.305
(Chewing loudly)

33:41.436 --> 33:45.782
I also got you a surprise.
But don't look until I'm ready.

33:45.899 --> 33:46.991
I don't see any reason

33:47.108 --> 33:48.576
why you'd need to come
with me today.

33:48.693 --> 33:51.367
I'm just going to case Kutter's apartment.

33:51.488 --> 33:55.163
I got to find out if she's home
or when she'll be back.

33:56.284 --> 33:58.628
Maybe I can find out
where she works.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.088
It's going to be dull,

34:00.205 --> 34:03.004
so I figured you'd have
a better time here

34:03.792 --> 34:07.422
- with this. Ta-dah!
- (Burps)

34:15.512 --> 34:18.516
Great, huh?
Got it on 14th Street.

34:18.639 --> 34:19.857
Even has a guarantee.

34:19.975 --> 34:21.522
Listen, I don't know
how long I'll be,

34:21.643 --> 34:23.190
but if you get tired
of watching TV,

34:23.311 --> 34:24.483
I also got you a paper.

34:24.603 --> 34:26.277
See you later.

35:01.516 --> 35:02.984
Hi.

35:20.118 --> 35:23.668
I got to get these boots off.
My feet are killing me.

35:26.291 --> 35:28.840
That was a rare thrill.

35:28.960 --> 35:32.385
Every time the wind blew,
I thought I was gonna collapse.

35:32.505 --> 35:35.884
Listen, don't get mad
or anything, but...

35:36.009 --> 35:37.602
I really don't want
to see the city.

35:37.719 --> 35:42.270
I just said that as
an excuse to see you.

35:42.390 --> 35:45.485
- You're not mad?
- You dummy!

35:45.602 --> 35:48.230
I suggested we tour
the city for the same reason.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.483
You went along with it.

35:50.607 --> 35:52.905
I wanted to be with you, too.

35:54.486 --> 35:58.616
- You did?
- Dwayne!

35:58.740 --> 36:05.294
I know an awful lot of guys,
Dwayne, but you're different.

36:05.413 --> 36:08.087
Don't they have girls upstate?

36:08.208 --> 36:11.929
Well, I keep pretty much
to myself.

36:12.045 --> 36:14.013
You're a dying breed, Dwayne.

36:35.485 --> 36:37.487
(Squeals)

36:48.957 --> 36:50.959
(Squealing continues)

37:23.992 --> 37:25.460
What the hell's
going on in here?

37:25.577 --> 37:28.000
- Sounds like an animal.
- Go check it out, man.

37:28.121 --> 37:29.668
It's wrecking up the place, man.

37:29.789 --> 37:32.793
- (All shouting indistinctly)
- (Growling)

37:32.917 --> 37:37.218
In here, in here.

37:53.688 --> 37:55.361
(Screams)

37:55.482 --> 37:58.486
What the hell
is going on up there?

38:04.157 --> 38:06.580
I'm trying to get some sleep
but that guy above me,

38:06.701 --> 38:10.046
- he's gone crazy.
- I know, I know.

38:10.163 --> 38:12.962
- (indistinct shouting)
- I gotta get some sleep.

38:20.131 --> 38:21.132
Hey!

38:22.258 --> 38:25.762
- (indistinct chattering)
- C'mon, let me through.

38:25.887 --> 38:27.889
Get out of the way.
Get out my way.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.810
In here. In here.

38:31.935 --> 38:33.437
Come on. Back off, please.

38:33.561 --> 38:35.780
- Back off! Move back, huh?
- (indistinct chattering)

38:41.528 --> 38:43.622
- (Woman) What's going in there?
- (Man) Alright, OK.

38:45.615 --> 38:47.743
What the hell went on here?

38:47.867 --> 38:50.336
Looks like a goddamn bomb
hit this place.

38:50.453 --> 38:53.627
- Where's the kid?
- Went out earlier today.

38:53.748 --> 38:55.091
Well, no came out of here,

38:55.208 --> 38:56.630
I've been standing here
all the time

38:56.751 --> 38:58.253
all the while
it was being wrecked.

38:58.378 --> 39:00.346
Someone's got to be in here.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.010
Unless they climbed
out the window.

39:02.131 --> 39:03.599
Cause this just
doesn't make any sense.

39:03.716 --> 39:05.810
These things didn't get
thrown around by themselves.

39:07.971 --> 39:08.847
I heard screaming.

39:08.972 --> 39:10.565
They couldn't have gotten out
without me seeing them.

39:10.682 --> 39:11.979
I mean, I
was the first one here,

39:12.100 --> 39:14.228
and I've been leaning right
against the door, no one came out,

39:14.352 --> 39:16.650
which means they're still
in here. Somewhere in here.

39:16.771 --> 39:18.318
Well, whoever was in here
ain't here now.

39:18.439 --> 39:20.112
- That's impossible!
- (Hotel manager) Really?

39:20.233 --> 39:23.032
- (Woman) Something's wrong.
- (Hotel manager) C'mon.

39:23.152 --> 39:26.281
O'Donovan. O'Donovan!
Come on, let's go.

39:26.406 --> 39:27.328
Break it up.

39:27.448 --> 39:29.121
I don't want anybody congregating
around the halls here.

39:29.242 --> 39:31.336
Come on, get back to your rooms.
There's nothing here to see.

39:31.452 --> 39:32.578
- (Man) What?
- Come on!

39:32.704 --> 39:36.550
- I don't understand.
- Move it! C'm0n, O'Don0van.

39:36.666 --> 39:38.668
No, I'm going to my room.

39:38.793 --> 39:41.046
I am gonna lie down for a while.

39:41.170 --> 39:42.968
All right, everybody,
break it up.

39:43.089 --> 39:44.306
Nothing here, let's go.

39:44.424 --> 39:46.176
Come on, guys,
back to your room. Let's go.

39:46.301 --> 39:49.430
- (Man) So, what happened?
- Nothing. Nothing happened.

39:49.554 --> 39:54.560
Look, if uh, this happens again,
uh, I don't know.

39:54.684 --> 39:57.278
What do I know?
I don't even run the place.

39:57.395 --> 39:58.772
Why should anybody
tell me anything.

39:58.897 --> 39:59.898
I don't know nothing.

40:00.023 --> 40:02.196
Why should I know anything?
No reason why.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.217
- (Grunting)
- (Screaming)

41:27.193 --> 41:29.070
Dwayne, are you all right?

41:42.583 --> 41:46.963
- I've gotta get back.
- Dwayne? Dwayne, wait!

41:47.088 --> 41:48.931
Wait!

41:50.091 --> 41:51.593
(Woman) Please hurry!
I don't know what's going on!

41:51.718 --> 41:53.470
(Hotel manager)
Get out of the way.

41:53.594 --> 41:55.471
(indistinct chatter)

42:21.748 --> 42:23.842
(Woman) Oh, God.

42:37.930 --> 42:41.275
All right. Jesus Christ.
Clear the lobby, c'mon.

42:41.392 --> 42:43.690
Come on, Boland. Outside.
Let's go.

42:43.811 --> 42:45.984
- What happened?
- Somebody killed O'Donovan.

42:46.105 --> 42:47.903
- They ripped him to pieces.
- They just carried him away.

42:48.024 --> 42:49.367
But the cops have
been drilling everyone.

42:49.484 --> 42:51.157
- Dwayne!
- You can't come in here.

42:51.277 --> 42:53.029
- What happened?
- Get out of here!

42:53.154 --> 42:55.031
- Calm down...
- You heard what they said.

42:55.156 --> 42:57.033
- He killed O'Donovan.
- Who?

42:57.158 --> 42:59.502
I don't want him killing you.

43:03.581 --> 43:05.083
Thanks,
you've been very helpful.

43:05.208 --> 43:07.085
We'll probably have
more questions...

43:17.220 --> 43:18.938
Uh, would you hold it a minute?

43:21.390 --> 43:22.767
- You live here?
- Yes.

43:22.892 --> 43:24.644
- What's your name?
- Dwayne Bradley.

43:24.769 --> 43:27.238
- How long you been out, Dwayne?
- Since this morning.

43:27.355 --> 43:29.778
You have any pets?
Any animals in there?

43:29.899 --> 43:31.492
No, nothing. why?

43:31.609 --> 43:34.078
Well, one of your neighbors,
a Mr. Brian Mickey O'Donovan

43:34.195 --> 43:35.412
was murdered a few hours ago,

43:35.530 --> 43:37.624
and we're just questioning
everybody in the building.

43:37.740 --> 43:39.834
- Mind if we come in?
- No.

43:52.296 --> 43:54.094
Dwayne, right before the murder,
some of the tenants

43:54.215 --> 43:57.185
claim to have heard noises
coming from this room,

43:57.301 --> 44:00.350
like someone on a rampage.

44:00.471 --> 44:05.398
- Any idea who it was?
- No, I don't know. I was out.

44:05.518 --> 44:07.691
What happened?

44:07.812 --> 44:09.780
That was an accident.
It happened last night.

44:09.897 --> 44:12.867
- We went out for burgers and...
- We?

44:12.984 --> 44:15.157
No, me. Just me.

44:15.278 --> 44:18.873
And you don't own any pets?
No dogs or anything?

44:18.990 --> 44:20.082
No.

44:22.451 --> 44:23.953
What's in the basket?

44:32.503 --> 44:33.595
Nothing?

44:37.008 --> 44:40.182
- Dwayne, where are you from?
- Upstate.

44:40.303 --> 44:42.226
Glenn's Falls upstate.

44:47.685 --> 44:50.529
You always leave money
lying around like that?

44:50.646 --> 44:51.647
Huh?

44:53.983 --> 44:56.202
Oh, it must have
fallen off the dresser.

44:56.319 --> 44:59.664
- And you've been out all day?
- Yes, since around 9:00.

44:59.780 --> 45:02.033
- Alone or...
- With someone?

45:03.993 --> 45:05.995
If you had to prove where you
were and who you were with,

45:06.120 --> 45:07.793
- would you be able to?
- Sure.

45:10.458 --> 45:11.926
How long are you
gonna be staying here?

45:12.043 --> 45:13.545
A few days.

45:13.669 --> 45:14.761
If I wanted to come back
again

45:14.879 --> 45:16.051
and look around,
would that be all right?

45:16.172 --> 45:17.264
Sure.

45:22.011 --> 45:25.356
OK, Mr. Bradley,
thank you very much.

45:25.473 --> 45:27.896
Listen, if you think
of anything that may help us,

45:28.017 --> 45:30.065
I'd appreciate you
getting in touch with us.

45:30.186 --> 45:31.654
OK, sure.

46:02.718 --> 46:06.313
Are you crazy?
You could've had us arrested.

46:06.430 --> 46:08.148
No, no.
You can't blame this on me.

46:08.266 --> 46:11.395
I didn't know
he'd break in or... What?

46:11.519 --> 46:14.489
Wait a minute. Hold it!

46:14.605 --> 46:16.903
All right, all right.

46:17.024 --> 46:20.403
OK, OK.
Yes, I was with a girl.

46:20.528 --> 46:22.530
Yes, the receptionist.

46:22.655 --> 46:24.248
Yes, I lied.

46:28.411 --> 46:30.960
No, I didn't go
to Dr. Kutter's.

46:31.080 --> 46:33.208
I knew if I told
you you'd get mad.

46:33.332 --> 46:35.630
- (Heavy breathing)
- I didn't do anything.

46:35.751 --> 46:38.220
She just showed me
around, that's all.

46:38.337 --> 46:40.385
I'm not deserting you.

46:40.506 --> 46:44.010
I just wanted some
time for myself.

46:44.135 --> 46:47.685
Look, I've helped with
everything so far, haven't I?

46:47.805 --> 46:49.398
Killing Lifflander
was your idea.

46:49.515 --> 46:52.439
Coming to New York to get
the other two was your idea.

46:52.560 --> 46:56.110
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
Let me finish.

46:57.148 --> 46:58.821
I'm not saying that.

47:01.610 --> 47:04.329
Of course you're right.
They deserve what they get.

47:04.447 --> 47:09.419
All I'm saying is it's been
your idea every step of the way.

47:09.535 --> 47:13.085
But I've helped you, haven't I?

47:13.205 --> 47:16.425
I'll never desert you, not
after all we've been through.

47:16.542 --> 47:19.045
You know that.

47:19.170 --> 47:21.013
We'll always be together.

47:24.383 --> 47:26.852
- (I Jazz playing)
- Hey, you're finally playing.

47:35.186 --> 47:37.655
Hey, y'all.
I don't believe it.

47:43.778 --> 47:45.030
Good to see you.

47:53.788 --> 47:56.007
What the hell are
you doing here'?

47:56.123 --> 47:57.716
Wait, no. Don't tell me.

47:57.833 --> 47:59.835
It's the first bar
you came to, right?

47:59.960 --> 48:01.678
Hi, Casy.

48:04.340 --> 48:06.138
You're really doing
New York in style.

48:06.258 --> 48:08.010
First the Bronx
and now this place.

48:08.135 --> 48:09.682
Uh, you come here often?

48:09.804 --> 48:12.899
- I don't even drink.
- That's obvious.

48:13.015 --> 48:15.438
You're not still upset
about this afternoon, are you?

48:15.559 --> 48:17.436
That isn't the half of it.

48:17.561 --> 48:20.064
I'm so messed up
about a lot things.

48:20.189 --> 48:22.988
And now this girl I've met.

48:23.109 --> 48:25.612
I don't know what's
going on anymore.

48:27.655 --> 48:28.702
- Tell you what.

48:28.823 --> 48:31.372
Why don't you
and that picnic basket of yours

48:31.492 --> 48:32.869
join me at the back table.

48:32.993 --> 48:34.495
I've got some heavy
boozing to do,

48:34.620 --> 48:37.373
and it looks like looks like
you could use some good company.

48:53.347 --> 48:54.394
So tell me.

48:54.515 --> 48:57.189
What are you doing,
Dwayne Fawles'?

48:57.309 --> 48:59.357
- I'm a sorter.
- A sort of what?

48:59.478 --> 49:02.231
No, a letter sorter.
I sort mail.

49:02.356 --> 49:04.279
You're a mailman?

49:10.489 --> 49:12.036
That's crazy.

49:13.701 --> 49:16.705
There's something else
I've been dying to ask you.

49:19.123 --> 49:21.626
What's in the basket?

49:21.750 --> 49:23.798
- My brother.
- Your brother!

49:28.257 --> 49:32.512
- What is he, a midget?
- No, we're twins.

49:32.636 --> 49:34.684
Siamese twins.

49:34.805 --> 49:37.558
That's funny, you
don't look Oriental.

49:40.311 --> 49:42.484
So what happened,
somebody shrink him?

49:42.605 --> 49:44.403
- No, he's deformed.

49:46.942 --> 49:50.037
A freak. He looks like
a squashed octopus.

49:52.823 --> 49:54.996
Our mother died
giving birth to us.

49:55.117 --> 49:57.211
He was attached
to my right side.

49:57.328 --> 49:59.422
They wouldn't let us go
to school or anything.

49:59.538 --> 50:03.259
They kept us hidden.
We were the big family secret.

50:03.375 --> 50:06.629
Everybody hated us
except our aunt.

50:06.754 --> 50:09.928
You see, he likes the dark.
Doesn't like to be seen.

50:10.049 --> 50:13.053
Not even by me sometimes.
And you know what else?

50:13.177 --> 50:14.929
He talks to me. Up here.

50:15.054 --> 50:17.603
Without words. I just hear him
whispering in my brain.

50:17.723 --> 50:20.442
Sometimes he talks for hours
and won't shut up.

50:20.559 --> 50:22.732
I used to be able
to talk to him like that.

50:22.853 --> 50:25.151
But that's when
we were still connected.

50:25.272 --> 50:27.775
Our aunt said
it was our special gift.

50:27.900 --> 50:30.528
But since we've been separated,
I can't do it anymore.

50:30.653 --> 50:32.451
But he can still do it to me.

50:32.571 --> 50:34.539
In fact,
he's even better at it now.

50:34.657 --> 50:36.500
He always knows
when I'm thinking.

50:36.617 --> 50:38.836
Dwayne,
you're giving me the creeps.

50:38.953 --> 50:40.751
They didn't want him to live.

50:40.871 --> 50:42.464
But he fooled them.
He didn't die.

50:42.581 --> 50:44.128
He just got stronger.

50:46.418 --> 50:48.420
Oh, if you knew
what it was like.

50:48.546 --> 50:51.299
Dwayne and I kept
hidden from everyone.

50:51.423 --> 50:53.846
We're both of us so messed up.

50:53.968 --> 50:58.018
I don't know which
one of us is worse.

50:58.138 --> 51:01.017
(Distorted) Dwayne. Dwayne?

51:03.018 --> 51:05.897
No, no! God, no.

51:06.021 --> 51:07.614
I don't even want it
in the house.

51:07.731 --> 51:09.529
It should be dead
instead of my wife.

51:09.650 --> 51:11.573
How could you let it be born?

51:11.694 --> 51:14.914
Why didn't you kill it
before it killed her?

51:15.030 --> 51:18.955
And then, after they tell me
my wife died,

51:19.076 --> 51:22.125
after they tell me my child
is a twisted lump of flesh,

51:22.246 --> 51:25.125
then she tells me I need
two names for it.

51:25.249 --> 51:27.343
One for the child,
and one for the monster,

51:27.459 --> 51:30.212
as if I had two sons
instead one freak.

51:30.337 --> 51:32.260
It killed its own mother!

51:32.381 --> 51:34.383
- You want a name for it?
- (Baby crying)

51:35.759 --> 51:37.432
A murderer!

51:43.517 --> 51:46.942
- The boy is how old now, 12?
- You mean boys.

51:47.062 --> 51:49.906
- There are two of them.
- Boys.

51:50.024 --> 51:51.526
Yes, of course.

51:54.278 --> 51:55.575
They're upstairs.

51:57.156 --> 51:59.955
And just how long have you
actually tutored the child?

52:00.075 --> 52:01.076
Children.

52:01.201 --> 52:03.124
I've been with them
since they were born.

52:03.245 --> 52:05.043
As their aunt,
I'm sure you're doing

52:05.164 --> 52:06.757
what you think best.

52:08.876 --> 52:11.129
I've got a copy
of your teaching certificate

52:11.253 --> 52:13.221
as well as the school
board's report.

52:13.339 --> 52:15.808
However, the state
does have final say,

52:15.924 --> 52:17.972
and I must examine
the boy for myself

52:18.093 --> 52:20.767
before any tutoring
can replace proper schooling.

52:20.888 --> 52:23.232
Now, you do understand.

52:23.349 --> 52:26.899
Now if I may be blunt,
can't they...

52:27.019 --> 52:30.523
Couldn't they have an operation?

52:30.648 --> 52:32.321
It's not that simple.

52:53.128 --> 52:55.847
I think we should
discuss this downstairs.

53:00.052 --> 53:02.805
(Man 1) No, no. I think
we're making a big mistake.

53:02.930 --> 53:05.149
We're rushing things.
We shouldn't even be here.

53:05.265 --> 53:06.232
Where's the boy now?

53:06.350 --> 53:07.397
(Man 2) He's upstairs
in bed asleep.

53:08.352 --> 53:09.854
(Man 1) We need time
to think this over.

53:09.978 --> 53:11.025
Talk it over.

53:11.146 --> 53:12.238
(Man 2) We don't have time.

53:12.356 --> 53:14.779
It must be done now,
while my sister-in-law is away.

53:14.900 --> 53:16.902
(Man 1) I'm not sure.
I've got second thoughts.

53:17.027 --> 53:18.074
(Father) Bullshit,
second thoughts.

53:18.195 --> 53:21.369
I've had 12 years
of doctor's second thoughts.

53:21.490 --> 53:22.833
(Doctor) I don't know,
I just don't know.

53:22.950 --> 53:24.952
(Father) You'd sure know
if it were your own son

53:25.077 --> 53:26.579
- we were talking about.
- (Doctor) OK, OK.

53:26.704 --> 53:27.921
You understand
that if we separate

53:28.038 --> 53:30.416
the deformity from Dwayne
then it'll probably die.

53:30.541 --> 53:31.633
(Father) It's better off dead.

53:31.750 --> 53:33.423
What kind of life
would it have the way it is?

53:33.544 --> 53:35.012
We're talking about your child.

53:35.129 --> 53:36.096
Child?

53:36.213 --> 53:39.137
Dwayne is my child,
not that other thing.

53:39.258 --> 53:40.851
All I want is
Dwayne to be normal.

53:40.968 --> 53:42.470
It's too late
to change the other one.

53:42.594 --> 53:45.973
- Just cut Dwayne from it.
- I don't know. I don't know!

53:46.098 --> 53:49.318
The hospital says no.
Every doctor I've asked says no.

53:49.435 --> 53:51.733
You two may be my last hope.

53:51.854 --> 53:53.026
I don't know who you are,

53:53.147 --> 53:55.525
or where Lifflander
found you and I don't care.

53:55.649 --> 53:58.072
No questions asked.
Just separate them.

53:58.193 --> 53:59.319
He's right, of course.

53:59.445 --> 54:01.698
The boy should have
a chance at a normal life.

54:01.822 --> 54:05.122
They don't share organs or bone,
just tissue and flesh.

54:05.242 --> 54:06.915
If the operation is successful

54:07.035 --> 54:09.037
the most Dwayne
would have is a nasty scar.

54:09.163 --> 54:10.164
And the other one?

54:10.289 --> 54:14.010
Doctor, I'm not
even sure it's human.

54:14.126 --> 54:16.128
(Gasping for air)

54:16.628 --> 54:19.302
No, God, no.
Help, help. No!

54:19.423 --> 54:21.642
- Stop fighting, goddammit.
- (Dwayne) Ah!

54:21.759 --> 54:24.478
We're just going into
the dining room, boy, now stop it.

54:24.595 --> 54:26.347
This won't hurt, boy. I promise.

54:26.472 --> 54:28.816
- This won't hurt.
- Help, help!

54:28.932 --> 54:30.275
No, no.

54:30.392 --> 54:32.394
- Dwayne, hold still.
- Ah!

54:32.519 --> 54:34.521
No, no!

54:34.646 --> 54:37.069
We're only trying to help you.

54:37.191 --> 54:38.818
- You've got to hold him still.
- Goddammit.

54:38.942 --> 54:41.570
- No, ah!
- (Kutter) Hold his arms.

54:41.695 --> 54:44.118
- Goddammit, help.
- (Kutter) Hold still.

54:44.239 --> 54:46.241
No! God, no! Help!

54:46.909 --> 54:48.627
- Owww!
- (Kutter) Hold him, hold him.

54:48.744 --> 54:49.961
That's it.

54:50.078 --> 54:52.046
Argh!

54:54.124 --> 54:56.843
This is not going to work
if he's squirming around.

54:56.960 --> 54:59.554
- Hold him still.
- (Kutter) Hold him.

55:02.257 --> 55:04.009
Look, I've got it. Hold on.

55:04.134 --> 55:05.602
All right, all right.

55:05.719 --> 55:07.813
(Screams)

55:30.786 --> 55:32.709
(Screams)

56:52.659 --> 56:54.377
Is that you, Belial?

56:55.495 --> 56:56.792
Where?

56:58.457 --> 56:59.424
I'm coming.

58:05.023 --> 58:07.617
(Hammering)

58:21.957 --> 58:25.006
<i>'</i> Dwayne?
" (Sawing)

58:44.062 --> 58:46.781
(Electric saw)

59:21.725 --> 59:24.148
- Dwayne?
- (Wood falling)

59:28.356 --> 59:30.324
Goddammit, Dwayne,
if that's you down there,

59:30.442 --> 59:31.944
you better answer me.

59:44.247 --> 59:45.294
Dwayne?

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:52.566
- Argh!

01:01:03.201 --> 01:01:05.203
(Electric saw turns on)

01:01:19.634 --> 01:01:20.806
(Screams)

01:01:28.935 --> 01:01:30.778
It's all right now.

01:01:32.272 --> 01:01:34.741
Everyone's gone.
The police have left.

01:01:36.776 --> 01:01:40.121
They could find no evidence
of who killed your father.

01:01:40.238 --> 01:01:42.957
Nor do they have any idea
what killed him.

01:01:43.074 --> 01:01:45.793
Dr. Lifflander said
that he performed

01:01:45.911 --> 01:01:47.083
an emergency operation

01:01:47.204 --> 01:01:51.630
on your brother and that he died
and was removed from your side.

01:01:54.252 --> 01:01:57.096
I'm not going to ask you
what really happened.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:02:00.093
I know that you and your
brother have gone through hell.

01:02:00.217 --> 01:02:02.891
Everyone thinks Belial
is dead now, and we'll let them.

01:02:03.011 --> 01:02:04.604
It's safer that way.

01:02:04.721 --> 01:02:07.065
But I'm here now
to take care you.

01:02:07.182 --> 01:02:08.525
Both of you.

01:02:22.614 --> 01:02:23.911
"Art thou afraid?

01:02:24.032 --> 01:02:25.454
"No, Monster, not I.

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:28.328
"Be not afraid
the isle is full of noises,

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:31.627
"sounds, and sweet airs
that give delight and hurt not.

01:02:31.748 --> 01:02:33.921
"Sometimes a thousand
tangling instruments

01:02:34.042 --> 01:02:35.669
"will hum about mine ears.

01:02:35.794 --> 01:02:37.296
"And sometimes voices,

01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:39.764
"that if I then had waked
after long sleep,

01:02:39.881 --> 01:02:41.383
"will make me sleep again.

01:02:41.508 --> 01:02:42.885
"And then in dreaming

01:02:43.009 --> 01:02:44.511
"the clouds we thought would open

01:02:44.636 --> 01:02:46.730
"and show riches
ready to drop upon me

01:02:46.846 --> 01:02:50.692
"that when I waked,
I cried to dream again."

01:03:14.749 --> 01:03:15.750
Dwayne.

01:03:32.976 --> 01:03:34.353
That's your room...

01:03:34.477 --> 01:03:35.729
Yeah, but you're going
home first.

01:03:35.854 --> 01:03:37.322
No, no. You first.

01:03:37.439 --> 01:03:39.066
Oh, all right.

01:03:42.027 --> 01:03:43.495
Now yours.

01:03:43.611 --> 01:03:44.863
I'm OK, really.

01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:46.035
Yeah, I know.
Give me your keys.

01:03:46.156 --> 01:03:48.033
I can do it myself.

01:03:50.660 --> 01:03:53.163
I'm fine. Really.

01:03:53.288 --> 01:03:55.336
- I'm really OK.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:03:59.419 --> 01:04:03.344
- See? I'm all right.
- Are you sure?

01:04:03.465 --> 01:04:06.935
- 100%.
- OK, baby.

01:04:25.153 --> 01:04:26.405
Come on.

01:04:28.156 --> 01:04:29.408
Whoops.

01:05:05.944 --> 01:05:07.537
Almost forgot him.

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:53.069
(Heavy breathing)

01:08:04.539 --> 01:08:06.541
(Screams)

01:08:08.209 --> 01:08:10.553
Help! Help!

01:08:21.264 --> 01:08:22.810
There's something in my room!

01:08:23.975 --> 01:08:25.192
Out!

01:08:25.310 --> 01:08:29.234
I don't know what it is.
It's going to kill me.

01:08:29.354 --> 01:08:32.984
(Panting and screaming)
In there... Nothing else...

01:08:33.109 --> 01:08:36.988
(Screams)
There's something in my room!

01:08:39.073 --> 01:08:41.622
(Screaming)

01:08:50.542 --> 01:08:53.638
I'm not going back in there.
I can't even go back in there.

01:08:53.755 --> 01:08:56.725
(Woman)
You stay with me tonight.

01:09:00.219 --> 01:09:01.595
I want you to stay with me.

01:09:03.014 --> 01:09:04.265
Sleep on my couch.

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:25.203
Whatever was in there,
is gone.

01:09:25.328 --> 01:09:27.126
- No.
- It's all right.

01:09:27.246 --> 01:09:30.420
You're going to stay
with me tonight.

01:09:30.541 --> 01:09:32.589
- I'm glad somebody's going...
- All right!

01:09:32.710 --> 01:09:35.554
Get back to your rooms.
Come on!

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.595
This ain't a goddamn
subway station.

01:09:37.715 --> 01:09:39.716
(indistinct chatter)

01:10:22.802 --> 01:10:25.726
This isn't a hotel,
it's a nuthouse.

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:04.598
Come on,
let's get this over with.

01:11:20.067 --> 01:11:23.162
She's a vet.
An animal doctor.

01:11:35.708 --> 01:11:37.051
Mr. White?

01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:46.894
It's the last door
at the end of the hall.

01:11:51.015 --> 01:11:53.734
So tell me about your cat.

01:11:53.851 --> 01:11:55.569
You said on the phone
he's badly cut.

01:11:55.686 --> 01:11:56.812
Yes. On his side.

01:11:56.938 --> 01:11:59.566
OK. Let's take him
into the next room.

01:12:05.822 --> 01:12:07.916
Just sit him there on the table.

01:12:12.995 --> 01:12:15.874
Well then, let's
take a look at him.

01:12:15.998 --> 01:12:18.217
- Only it's not a cat.
- I thought you said...

01:12:18.334 --> 01:12:20.382
And I think I should explain
how he got his cut

01:12:20.503 --> 01:12:21.880
before you see him.

01:12:22.004 --> 01:12:24.974
Another vet, Doctor Lifflander,

01:12:25.091 --> 01:12:28.721
operated on him upstate
unsuccessfully.

01:12:28.845 --> 01:12:33.601
- Doctor Lifflander.
- Yes. You know him?

01:12:33.724 --> 01:12:36.398
Ah, yes. I see.

01:12:36.519 --> 01:12:38.738
I'm beginning to understand now.

01:12:38.855 --> 01:12:41.233
You're that kid
Needleman warned me about.

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:44.952
The Bradley boy.
The freak we separated.

01:12:45.069 --> 01:12:47.993
What a pleasant surprise
after all these years.

01:12:48.114 --> 01:12:49.115
You seemed to have gone

01:12:49.240 --> 01:12:51.288
to a great deal of trouble
to find me.

01:12:51.409 --> 01:12:53.161
The question is why?

01:12:53.286 --> 01:12:55.084
I would assume it's to thank me?

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.330
To thank you?

01:12:56.455 --> 01:12:59.675
Well, after all,
I made you normal, didn't I?

01:12:59.792 --> 01:13:04.764
- You did it to kill my brother.
- Oh, dear. Hostility.

01:13:04.881 --> 01:13:08.101
You've got two seconds to haul
your ass out of my office.

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:10.515
I'm not going to be threatened
by some adolescent punk

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:13.355
with a smoldering grudge unless
you've grown something else

01:13:13.472 --> 01:13:15.224
you want cut off.

01:13:16.267 --> 01:13:18.110
What's in the basket?

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:20.321
(Screams)

01:13:20.438 --> 01:13:22.031
(Screams)

01:14:09.487 --> 01:14:12.536
Doctor? Dr. Kutter,
are you all right?

01:14:12.615 --> 01:14:14.709
Open the door!

01:14:46.273 --> 01:14:50.528
Doctor! Dr. Kutter!
Are you all right in there?

01:14:50.611 --> 01:14:55.162
Dr. Kutter! Open the door!
Dr. Kutter!

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:33.909
Oh, God, Dwayne,
something awful happened.

01:15:34.030 --> 01:15:35.156
What? Tell me.

01:15:35.281 --> 01:15:37.079
I've been
with the police all morning.

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:39.918
- The police?
- Dr. Needleman's been murdered.

01:15:40.036 --> 01:15:42.289
They found his body
sometime last night.

01:15:42.413 --> 01:15:43.630
They don't think that you...

01:15:43.748 --> 01:15:45.466
Oh, no, of course not.

01:15:45.583 --> 01:15:48.962
But it's so awful,
and I'm still shaky.

01:15:49.086 --> 01:15:50.554
I mean,
I didn't like the man,

01:15:50.671 --> 01:15:53.766
but God, Dwayne,
someone killing him.

01:15:53.883 --> 01:15:55.385
I'm a wreck.

01:15:57.178 --> 01:16:01.399
I need to be with someone.
I don't want to be alone.

01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:05.774
I want to be with you, Dwayne.

01:16:11.901 --> 01:16:13.494
I don't know why.

01:16:13.611 --> 01:16:15.329
Especially after
the way you acted yesterday,

01:16:15.446 --> 01:16:16.993
but I just...

01:16:17.114 --> 01:16:19.537
You're the first person
I thought of.

01:16:19.658 --> 01:16:22.081
The only person I thought of.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:28.551
Please, don't cry.
It's all right, really.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.179
Come on.
Come on upstairs.

01:16:40.596 --> 01:16:42.064
It's awful.

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:44.479
They wanted me
to identify the body

01:16:44.600 --> 01:16:46.477
until they saw
how badly I was taking it.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.400
I don't understand
why I'm this upset.

01:16:48.521 --> 01:16:49.943
I just am.

01:16:50.064 --> 01:16:52.738
And I don't know
why I've been thinking of you,

01:16:52.858 --> 01:16:54.826
but it's all I did.

01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:58.699
I've been thinking
of you all day.

01:16:58.823 --> 01:17:00.746
Oh, God, Dwayne.

01:18:08.434 --> 01:18:09.686
Take me, Dwayne.

01:18:09.810 --> 01:18:12.029
(Screams)

01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:14.114
Dwayne, let me up. Let me up.

01:18:14.690 --> 01:18:17.739
Dwayne, let me up.
Let me up, Dwayne.

01:18:19.278 --> 01:18:22.248
Dwayne, let me up!

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:24.366
Dwayne, let's go.

01:18:48.641 --> 01:18:50.689
<i>Dwayne. ope“ UP-</i>

01:18:50.809 --> 01:18:53.483
What's happening in there?
Open up.

01:18:53.604 --> 01:18:55.277
<i>Dwayne. ope“ UP-</i>

01:18:55.856 --> 01:18:58.075
What are you trying
to do to me?

01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:04.994
- Go away.
- Let me in.

01:19:05.115 --> 01:19:07.288
Dwayne, let me in.

01:19:07.409 --> 01:19:09.411
It will never work.

01:19:09.536 --> 01:19:11.789
Damn you. Damn you.

01:19:12.706 --> 01:19:14.583
Dwayne, talk to me, please.

01:19:14.708 --> 01:19:17.928
Damn you, damn you, damn you.

01:19:18.045 --> 01:19:22.642
God damn. Why?

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:38.152
Dwayne!

01:21:48.070 --> 01:21:50.072
Ah...

01:27:07.472 --> 01:27:09.065
No. No.

01:27:09.182 --> 01:27:10.183
Never again.

01:27:10.308 --> 01:27:13.653
She was good.
She was good.

01:27:13.770 --> 01:27:16.023
She wasn't one of them.

01:27:16.148 --> 01:27:19.118
Why her?
Because I wanted her,

01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:23.080
and she wanted me.
What's wrong with you?

01:27:23.196 --> 01:27:26.871
No, I'll never let
you out of here. No.

01:27:26.992 --> 01:27:29.461
No, I won't have it.

01:27:29.578 --> 01:27:32.422
Just because you can't,
doesn't mean I shouldn't.

01:27:32.539 --> 01:27:36.134
No, Goddammit.
Damn you to hell.

01:27:36.251 --> 01:27:37.924
Is this what I have to worry
about every time

01:27:38.044 --> 01:27:39.296
I find a girl I like?

01:27:39.421 --> 01:27:41.014
You climbing on top of her?

01:27:41.131 --> 01:27:43.975
If I ever get my hands
on you again, I'll kill you.

01:27:44.092 --> 01:27:45.935
I swear to God, I'll kill you.

01:27:46.052 --> 01:27:49.056
First girl I ever kissed,
you destroy her.

01:27:49.181 --> 01:27:52.811
(Woman) I hear screaming.
I don't know what's going on.

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:53.981
(Dwayne) Damn you.

01:27:56.646 --> 01:27:58.398
Get out of here!

01:28:15.999 --> 01:28:17.171
No!

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:24.515
Jesus Christ!

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:48.414
Ah!

01:28:48.532 --> 01:28:49.829
Oh. What's that?

01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:51.998
Oh girls, look at that.
What is that?

01:28:52.118 --> 01:28:53.745
Oh no.

01:28:57.165 --> 01:28:59.793
(indistinct chatter)

01:29:02.254 --> 01:29:04.256
Hey, are you OK up there?

01:29:32.158 --> 01:29:34.661
(indistinct chatter)
