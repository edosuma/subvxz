00:58.900 --> 01:00.100
Beckett.

01:08.300 --> 01:11.300
all workers, please clear
the construction site.

01:11.400 --> 01:13.500
Why can't they find bodies
between 9:00 and 5:00?

01:13.600 --> 01:15.000
Well, early bird gets the collar.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.200
Yeah.

01:19.200 --> 01:21.000
He was here before i was.

01:21.600 --> 01:24.800
Oh! Finally, you are here.
You are gonna love this.

01:26.200 --> 01:27.500
come on, show's over!

01:27.600 --> 01:30.900
Active crime scene.
We appreciate your cooperation.

01:33.700 --> 01:36.500
Awesome, right?
My first cold case.

01:37.000 --> 01:38.400
Come on,
it's a little funny.

01:38.400 --> 01:42.200
Not so much funny as true.
She's frozen solid.

01:42.400 --> 01:43.700
What was the temperature last night?

01:43.800 --> 01:44.900
Mid-40s.

01:45.000 --> 01:46.500
It wasn't exposure.

01:46.600 --> 01:47.600
Site's active.

01:47.700 --> 01:50.600
The boys tell me there's no way
she was here last night.

01:57.800 --> 01:58.900
she's melting.

01:59.100 --> 02:01.500
Maybe we should be looking
for ruby slippers.

02:01.700 --> 02:05.200
Yeah, while you're at it, why don't you look for
some flying monkeys? Maybe they left her here.

02:05.400 --> 02:06.500
So what do you got for me?

02:06.600 --> 02:09.500
There are pieces of plastic on
her body from the garment bag.

02:09.600 --> 02:11.600
- So she was inside the bag?
- Mm-Hmm.

02:11.700 --> 02:14.400
Other than that, it's gonna
take a while for her to thaw.

02:14.500 --> 02:16.900
I can tell you
she hasn't been here long.

02:17.100 --> 02:18.200
Mayba couple of hours.

02:18.300 --> 02:19.700
What about security?

02:19.800 --> 02:22.400
Chain-Link. Pair of bolt
cutters took care of that.

02:22.500 --> 02:25.100
Looks like our guy was hoping
she'd disappear into the concrete pour.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.000
a few more feet,
and she would've.

02:27.200 --> 02:30.500
It's kind of odd-- taking the trouble
to freeze a body and then dumping it?

02:30.600 --> 02:33.000
We got two personality
types working hered.

02:33.200 --> 02:36.400
A killer who freezes a body is
a keeper--He wants a souvenir.

02:36.500 --> 02:37.700
But a guy who dumps a body?

02:37.800 --> 02:40.200
Doesn't want to be
reminded of the crime.

02:41.300 --> 02:43.400
All right, i'm gonna
go check out the fence.

02:44.600 --> 02:45.700
mm-Hmm.

02:46.100 --> 02:49.100
Get a close-Up of her face.
I want to run her through missing persons.

02:49.300 --> 02:50.900
Oh, cool, like on
the discovery channel,

02:50.900 --> 02:53.600
Where you plug the photo into
facial recognition databases?

02:54.300 --> 02:57.400
- Yeah, just like that.
- Yes!

02:59.100 --> 03:03.100
Welcome to the department's official
facial recognition database.

03:04.700 --> 03:05.900
By hand?

03:06.300 --> 03:07.900
That's like life before tivo.

03:08.000 --> 03:11.200
Maybe you could download an app
on that phone of yours. You could just--

03:11.700 --> 03:13.400
There are a lot
of missing people.

03:13.400 --> 03:15.500
One way or another,???

03:15.600 --> 03:18.200
some end up dead, some turn up
in a double-Wide

03:18.300 --> 03:21.400
With a stripper named trixie
outside atlantic city.

03:21.500 --> 03:24.000
And some
just don't turn up.

03:24.600 --> 03:25.600
Dana sullivan.

03:25.800 --> 03:27.900
Mm-Hmm. Her and her boyfriend
leave a club.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.700
He's a couple steps behind her
'Cause he gets a call on his cell phone.

03:30.900 --> 03:32.800
She turns a corner just
a few seconds before he does.

03:32.900 --> 03:35.400
And when he comes around,
she's gone.

03:35.500 --> 03:38.300
Street's totally empty--
No traffic, no nothing.

03:38.400 --> 03:42.400
In a matter of 3 feet,
she literally just disappeared.

03:43.300 --> 03:45.300
People don't disappear
off the face of the earth.

03:45.400 --> 03:46.400
Sure they do.

03:46.500 --> 03:49.100
Quantum physics, alien abductions,
Schrodinger's cat.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.200
One minute, you're getting
a hot dog in the park.

03:51.200 --> 03:54.400
the next, you're fighting off sleestaks
on the far side of a dimensional rift.

03:54.500 --> 03:56.600
I don't buy it. There's got ???

03:56.700 --> 03:59.600
A story that makes
everything make sense.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.600
Okay, castle,

04:02.100 --> 04:03.400
what's our jane doe's story?

04:03.500 --> 04:05.800
Well, i don't know how it starts,

04:05.900 --> 04:08.800
but i know how it ends--
Frozen at a construction site.

04:08.900 --> 04:12.600
So flying monkeys aside,
what's the first question?

04:12.900 --> 04:14.000
How did she get there?

04:14.200 --> 04:17.200
Considering she was frozen solid,
She had to have been kept pretty close.

04:17.200 --> 04:19.000
Not necessarily.

04:19.100 --> 04:22.800
Here is the site. Her body might not have
been kept as close as you might think.

04:22.900 --> 04:25.700
It takes a long time
for a frozen body to thaw.

04:25.800 --> 04:28.600
What, you, uh, freeze a body
once for one of your books?

04:28.700 --> 04:31.100
No, but i cooked a turkey
for thanksgiving.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.100
It was a 28-Pounder.
It took all night to unfreeze.

04:33.100 --> 04:35.100
She's a person, castle,
not a turkey.

04:35.200 --> 04:36.900
Just making a point.

04:40.100 --> 04:41.300
beckett.

04:42.500 --> 04:44.100
Okay. I'm on my way.

04:44.700 --> 04:46.300
lanie's got an i.D.

04:47.100 --> 04:48.600
You'll take care of these?

04:49.300 --> 04:52.000
Hey, ryan, can you, uh...
thanks.

04:55.000 --> 04:58.000
Melanie kavanaugh,
34 at time of death.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.300
Turns out c.O.D. Was
blunt-Force trauma to her head.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.100
How'd you get her i.D.?

05:04.200 --> 05:05.700
Her fingerprints were in the system.

05:05.800 --> 05:08.300
- For?
- Misdemeanor drug possession.

05:08.400 --> 05:09.900
She doesn't look like a junkie.

05:10.100 --> 05:12.500
No, she's in pretty good
shape, considering.

05:12.600 --> 05:15.100
But judging the lack of frost
and tissue degeneration,

05:15.100 --> 05:17.800
I'd say wherever she was stored,
the temperature rarely varied.

05:17.900 --> 05:19.700
- Like a freezer.
- Freezer'd do the job.

05:19.800 --> 05:21.100
How long has she been dead?

05:21.200 --> 05:23.800
Well, considering how long
she's been like this,

05:24.000 --> 05:25.700
Factoring decomposition,

05:25.800 --> 05:29.800
I'd say she probably was frozen
within 24 hours of being killed.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.000
What do you mean, "how long
she's been like this"?

05:33.300 --> 05:34.800
According to the records i pulled,

05:34.800 --> 05:37.900
this woman has been missing
for over five years.

05:44.400 --> 05:50.400
castle s01ep05

05:54.000 --> 05:56.000
She had a troubled childhood.

05:56.200 --> 05:58.100
Drug problems
in her teens and 20s.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.100
I know.

06:00.500 --> 06:01.700
How do you know?

06:01.900 --> 06:03.900
I read the case file.
She kicked the habit.

06:04.000 --> 06:06.300
Met and married
samuel kavanaugh.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.900
She worked in a restaurant.
He managed a bank. They have two kids.

06:10.000 --> 06:11.600
When did you read
the case file?

06:12.500 --> 06:13.900
when you were
in the little girls' room.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.300
I was gone for, like, a minute.

06:15.400 --> 06:16.300
Speed-Reader.

06:16.400 --> 06:20.000
???From my years stranded
in the new york public library.

06:24.000 --> 06:27.500
Would you like the cliffsnotes?
Or in this case, the castle notes?

06:27.800 --> 06:29.900
Castle, how do you know you didn't
miss something important?

06:30.000 --> 06:32.800
Like, after melanie disappeared,
her husband waited a day

06:32.800 --> 06:34.600
- before he called the cops.
- A day?

06:34.700 --> 06:36.000
That doesn't make anyense.

06:36.000 --> 06:37.600
Until you get
to the third paragraph.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.000
Before melanie was married,

06:39.000 --> 06:42.200
She was what is now referred
to as a "runaway bride."

06:42.300 --> 06:44.500
According to her husband,
she ran away a whole two weeks

06:44.500 --> 06:45.500
Before their wedding day.

06:45.600 --> 06:47.500
Mm-Hmm, and th
she came back.

06:47.600 --> 06:49.200
Three years
happily ever after,

06:49.400 --> 06:51.500
She disappears again
and comes back.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.800
Lather, rinse, repeat
three times.

06:53.900 --> 06:56.200
No indication
of where she went.

06:56.400 --> 06:58.000
Well, she must've had
a reason for running away.

06:58.100 --> 07:00.400
Hmm. I'm not judging her.

07:00.500 --> 07:03.400
Some people love the institution,
hate the day-To-Day.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.500
Are you one of those people,
castle?

07:07.200 --> 07:09.400
I guess i just haven't met
the right girl.

07:12.400 --> 07:15.100
So that's why her husband
didn't call the cops.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.400
She'd done it before.

07:16.500 --> 07:18.800
Seemed reasonable
to the detective at the time.

07:18.900 --> 07:22.800
There's no evidence of foul play,
So the detective just closed the case.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.400
Five years, and her husband
thought she just ran away?

07:28.500 --> 07:31.900
Guess it's time to tell him
His runaway bride finally came home.

07:37.300 --> 07:38.500
who is it?

07:38.800 --> 07:40.800
New york city
police department.

07:43.300 --> 07:44.400
Can i help you?

07:44.500 --> 07:46.700
Detective beckett.
Are you samuel kavanaugh?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.100
Who?

07:48.400 --> 07:51.100
Samuel kavanaugh. Our records
indicate that he lives here.

07:51.200 --> 07:52.700
No, you must have
the wrong apartment.

07:52.800 --> 07:53.900
9-1-7?

07:54.200 --> 07:57.600
Yeah, but i live here,
and my name is roger. It's not sam.

07:57.700 --> 07:59.200
Do you know any samuel kavanaugh?

07:59.300 --> 08:01.000
No. What's this about?

08:01.100 --> 08:02.300
How long have you lived here?

08:02.400 --> 08:04.000
About eight months.

08:04.300 --> 08:06.200
Well, it's been five years.
He could've moved.

08:06.300 --> 08:08.000
Well, yeah, i hate
to break it to you,

08:08.000 --> 08:10.300
but if you're looking for the guy
who lived here before me,

08:10.400 --> 08:12.800
he didn't move.
He was murdered.

08:15.100 --> 08:16.700
- Hey, beckett.
- Yeah?

08:16.800 --> 08:17.800
Samuel kavanaugh--

08:17.900 --> 08:19.700
Shot outside a grocery store
about a year ago.

08:19.800 --> 08:22.500
Small caliber, double tap to the chest.
Wallet and valuables missing.

08:22.600 --> 08:23.900
Poor schlub's wife ??

08:24.000 --> 08:25.300
Four years later,
he gets shot in a mugging.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.600
Yeah, what are the odds?

08:26.800 --> 08:29.000
Long, unless they're connected.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.600
What, four years ??

08:30.700 --> 08:32.400
One's a popsicle,
one just got popped.

08:32.500 --> 08:34.100
How could they possibly
be connected?

08:34.200 --> 08:36.600
Maybe he and his wife got into something
they couldn't get out of,

08:36.700 --> 08:38.500
Maybe something to do
with her drug habit.

08:38.600 --> 08:41.299
So some skell waits four years ??

08:41.400 --> 08:44.100
Maybe he finally figured out
what happened to his wife

08:44.100 --> 08:46.300
And was about to go
to the police with it.

08:46.500 --> 08:47.400
I don't believe it.

08:48.500 --> 08:51.000
Give me 250 pages.
I bet i could make you.

08:52.200 --> 08:55.000
We're solving a murder,
castle, not writing a book.

08:55.100 --> 08:57.700
I would call it, "a chill
runs through her veins."

08:57.800 --> 08:59.500
- Ooh, i like that.
- Huh?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.100
"Bam," said the lady.
Another best seller for me.

09:02.200 --> 09:03.300
What happened to the kids?

09:03.400 --> 09:05.500
Living with melanie's parents
up in white plains.

09:05.600 --> 09:07.900
Well, looks like i'm going
to white plains.

09:08.100 --> 09:10.700
Canvass the construction site.
Someone must've seen something.

09:10.800 --> 09:12.000
yeah, the foreman said that, uh,

09:12.100 --> 09:14.700
they have a problem with the homeless at night,
So i figured i'd go down there later,

09:14.800 --> 09:16.400
Try to catch 'em
at the site.

09:17.200 --> 09:20.900
Homeless, white plains.
Homeless, white plains.

09:21.100 --> 09:22.500
They're both
kinda creepy.

09:24.100 --> 09:25.400
All right.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.400
Did i scare ya?

09:33.500 --> 09:35.300
- Mr. Davidson?
- Aw.

09:35.800 --> 09:38.800
Yes, ma'am.
That's me.

09:39.300 --> 09:41.200
I'm detective kate beckett.

09:42.100 --> 09:43.900
Is there somewhere
we could talk?

09:44.300 --> 09:46.300
Yes. Why don't we go inside?

09:47.000 --> 09:48.900
Girls, don't play
in the street, okay?

09:49.100 --> 09:51.300
All right. Grandpa will be
out in a minute.

09:51.800 --> 09:54.300
I-I think we've both known
for a while now

09:54.300 --> 09:58.100
that melanie was not
going to come home.

09:59.300 --> 10:02.400
What do you remember about the days
leading up to her disappearance?

10:02.500 --> 10:04.900
Well, uh, we talked
to her a couple days before--

10:04.900 --> 10:06.800
Uh, my wife did, i mean.

10:06.800 --> 10:08.200
Everything seemed fine.

10:08.300 --> 10:10.300
She didn't indicate in any way
that she was leaving?

10:10.400 --> 10:11.400
No.

10:12.000 --> 10:14.900
We're aware your daughter
had some issues.

10:15.000 --> 10:16.800
That had nothing to do
with what happened here.

10:16.900 --> 10:18.400
How do you know?

10:19.000 --> 10:21.200
You know, now you sound like
the cop who first had the case--

10:21.200 --> 10:23.800
Convinced she'd run away,
convinced she was still on drugs.

10:23.800 --> 10:25.300
But you didn't think that.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.000
Melanie...

10:28.100 --> 10:30.400
wasn't the greatest of moms...

10:30.600 --> 10:33.600
But she loved her kids.

10:34.600 --> 10:36.100
She would've never left them.

10:36.200 --> 10:37.700
What about
her husband sam?

10:37.800 --> 10:38.800
Oh...

10:39.000 --> 10:40.300
He thought
it was drugs, too.

10:40.400 --> 10:44.000
You know he waited over a day
before he reported her missing?

10:44.100 --> 10:45.500
She had run off before.

10:45.600 --> 10:47.600
Look, i'm not gonna sit here
and deny that,

10:47.800 --> 10:49.600
But if sam thought
our daughter was in trouble,

10:49.600 --> 10:51.400
Why didn't he report her
missing right away?

10:51.500 --> 10:52.900
Why didn't he call for help?

10:52.900 --> 10:55.800
Even if she'd gotten locked up,
She'd have been better off than--

10:56.400 --> 10:58.500
Oh, what the hell's
the difference? I mean,

10:58.600 --> 11:01.900
the time to ask these
questions was five years ago,

11:02.100 --> 11:05.000
But the cop who was on the case
then didn't want to ask them.

11:05.500 --> 11:07.900
Sounds like they were pretty unhappy
with the original investigation.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.000
Yeah, well, they had
every reason to be.

11:11.700 --> 11:14.000
The guy whose case it was--

11:14.200 --> 11:14.900
You know him?

11:15.000 --> 11:17.500
No. Detective sloan
was before my time.

11:17.600 --> 11:18.700
He still around?

11:18.800 --> 11:21.100
Well, if you count being
a sheriff in jersey,

11:21.100 --> 11:23.100
then yeah, he's still around.

11:23.400 --> 11:25.300
Melanie kavanaugh.

11:25.700 --> 11:28.500
So she was finally found
after all these years, huh?

11:28.700 --> 11:31.200
She wasn't found.
Her body was.

11:32.800 --> 11:33.800
Oh.

11:34.100 --> 11:35.800
I'm sorry to hear that.

11:36.500 --> 11:38.700
You know, from the moment
i took that case,

11:38.800 --> 11:40.800
I figured it was gonna end bad.

11:40.900 --> 11:44.500
Her parents led us to believe that you
were pretty sure that she'd run off.

11:44.600 --> 11:46.500
Her being found dead
and her running off

11:46.600 --> 11:49.600
Are not exactly incompatible,
not with her history.

11:49.800 --> 11:52.900
Her parents also believe yonvnvestigation
never made it past her history.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.100
I was on a missing persons,
not a murder.

11:55.200 --> 11:56.000
You have a dead body.

11:56.100 --> 11:58.600
All i had was a-
A woman with a drug habit

11:58.600 --> 12:00.900
And a history
of, uh, disappearing.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.900
And a husband who didn't report
her missing for over day.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.100
Don't you dare play monday
morning quarterback with me.

12:08.200 --> 12:09.900
Look, sweetheart,
he cooperated.

12:10.000 --> 12:13.200
He voluntarily allowed c.S.U.
Into their apartment.

12:13.400 --> 12:14.500
Anything i asked, he did.

12:14.600 --> 12:16.700
Did you know he
was murdered, too?

12:17.600 --> 12:20.500
Gunned down on the street,
over a year ago.

12:20.700 --> 12:22.000
Look, what do you want
from me?

12:22.100 --> 12:25.700
We had reports of her in philly
with a meth head ex-Boyfriend.

12:25.800 --> 12:27.000
I mean, it was what it was.

12:27.100 --> 12:29.100
But you didn't even go down
to check it out.

12:29.200 --> 12:31.200
Didn't need to.
Had reports.

12:31.400 --> 12:35.400
Right. From her husband's
best friend charles wyler.

12:35.700 --> 12:38.400
- So?
- He's not exactly an impartial observer.

12:38.400 --> 12:41.400
The guy owned his own business.
He had a family. He was a war vet.

12:41.500 --> 12:43.200
I saw no reason
to doubt his word.

12:43.300 --> 12:45.900
Plus, philly's a pretty long drive.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.500
She was only missing ???

12:48.700 --> 12:50.800
No, sheriff,
she was already dead.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.900
You just didn't know it yet.

12:55.400 --> 12:58.700
i ever disappear, make sure
this guy's not on my case.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.800
I hate cops like him.

13:01.000 --> 13:03.700
Guys like him-- Things only
make sense if they fit in a box.

13:03.700 --> 13:06.600
So they make 'em fit,
and murderergo free.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.900
Is that what happened to your dad?

13:09.700 --> 13:10.700
My dad?

13:10.800 --> 13:12.200
I noticed your watch.

13:13.300 --> 13:14.600
It's your dad's, right?

13:14.800 --> 13:16.400
That's why you wear it?

13:19.800 --> 13:21.000
beckett.

13:27.600 --> 13:29.000
You find a witness?

13:29.100 --> 13:32.700
Yeah, homeless guy. A couple
of bucks jogged his memory.

13:32.800 --> 13:34.700
Said he saw a dented yellow
truck pull up to the site.

13:34.800 --> 13:36.800
Heavyset guy pulls
a large bag out of the back,

13:36.900 --> 13:38.600
And when he comes out,
he doesn't have the bag anymore.

13:38.700 --> 13:40.100
How'd you find this place?

13:40.200 --> 13:42.500
Guy also remembered the word "storage"
Written on the side of the truck.

13:42.500 --> 13:44.400
We searched all the storage ???

13:44.400 --> 13:45.800
And found that this one
uses yellow trucks.

13:45.900 --> 13:46.800
Mm-Hmm.

13:46.900 --> 13:48.200
So who owns the trucks?

13:48.400 --> 13:51.100
According to the d.M.V.,
albert bolland.

13:51.400 --> 13:53.900
What body? I don't know
what you're talking about.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.900
A witness saw someone driving
one of your yellow trucks

13:56.900 --> 13:58.300
And dumping the body.

13:58.300 --> 13:59.700
You're lying.
No one saw.

13:59.800 --> 14:03.800
Ouch. Wow. Maybe you should've
tried denying it first?

14:03.900 --> 14:05.100
Let me help you.

14:05.200 --> 14:09.000
Melanie kavanaugh, mother of two.
Wife of sam kavanaugh.

14:09.100 --> 14:11.600
Okay, look, i dumped her,

14:11.700 --> 14:14.100
- but i swear i didn't--
- You didn't kill her, right?
- That's right.

14:14.100 --> 14:15.300
- I found her.
- Uh-Huh.

14:15.300 --> 14:16.400
I never even knew
she was here.

14:16.400 --> 14:18.000
what do you mean "here"?

14:18.400 --> 14:19.600
Sixth floor.

14:20.300 --> 14:21.600
Renters were in arrears.

14:21.700 --> 14:24.700
We usually give 'em three months, And then
we cut the locks and we sell their belongings.

14:24.700 --> 14:26.500
Only this time,
all i find is a freezer

14:26.600 --> 14:28.200
Plugged into a light outlet,

14:28.400 --> 14:30.200
which, by the way,
Is totally illegal.

14:30.300 --> 14:32.800
You didn't think it was illegal
To store a dead body in a freezer?

14:32.800 --> 14:34.100
You think i knew?

14:34.200 --> 14:36.900
When i opened it up,
i nearly had a heart attack.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.400
You could've ???

14:38.500 --> 14:41.200
So i could make the front page of "the
ledger"? Yeah, that's good for business.

14:41.300 --> 14:43.500
What if it's a mob hit?
I mean, i got a family.

14:43.500 --> 14:44.600
So did she.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.100
so you find her.

14:47.200 --> 14:49.200
Next logical step--

14:49.400 --> 14:51.300
Dump her at a construction site?

14:51.900 --> 14:53.400
I know a guy
who works over there.

14:53.500 --> 14:55.800
So when i find the body, I figure,

14:55.900 --> 14:57.800
that's the place, right?

14:58.100 --> 14:59.900
Show us where you found her.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.300
five years in there.

15:15.400 --> 15:17.300
Nobody deserves that.

15:17.600 --> 15:19.400
How'd they make payments
for the unit?

15:19.500 --> 15:21.300
Check? Credit card?

15:21.400 --> 15:23.900
Cash. Every six months.

15:24.000 --> 15:26.000
But like i said,
they were three months overdue.

15:26.100 --> 15:29.200
Puts the last payment At two months
after her husband was killed.

15:29.300 --> 15:31.000
Hard to make payments ??

15:31.000 --> 15:32.000
Mm-Hmm.

15:33.000 --> 15:36.300
That camera in your office--You got
footage of the guy who made payments?

15:36.400 --> 15:37.900
That was nine months ago.

15:38.000 --> 15:40.200
We keep maybe
two weeks at a time.

15:40.300 --> 15:41.600
Looks like sloan was right.

15:41.700 --> 15:44.100
Sam kavanaugh didn't have
anything to do with it.

15:44.300 --> 15:47.000
Well, if not sam,
then who?

16:00.600 --> 16:02.400
You know, we have
air-Conditioning.

16:02.600 --> 16:03.600
Mm.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.100
I'm just trying
to figure out

16:05.100 --> 16:08.200
Why someone would put
a dead body in a freezer.

16:08.300 --> 16:11.300
Is this a nikki heat
or detective beckett question?

16:11.500 --> 16:13.300
- Beckett.
- Oh, that's right.

16:13.300 --> 16:16.300
The nikki heat thing was about incinerating
a body In a self-Cleaning oven.

16:16.300 --> 16:18.400
Mm-Hmm. I mean,

16:18.600 --> 16:20.500
you put things in a freezer
To keep 'em for later,

16:20.500 --> 16:23.000
But once they're there,
you rarely ever go back.

16:23.100 --> 16:26.900
If i was putting a body in a freezer,
It'd be because i was trying to hide it.

16:27.100 --> 16:29.500
Until you stopped paying
for the storage space.

16:29.900 --> 16:32.200
Did i stop,
or did something stop me?

16:36.700 --> 16:40.300
It's family moments like these
I will never forget.

16:40.900 --> 16:43.600
with a good therapist,
Hopefully i will.

16:46.300 --> 16:47.100
mr. Wyler,

16:47.100 --> 16:49.700
The detective investigating
melanie's disappearance

16:49.700 --> 16:53.700
Said that you told him that she went
to an ex-Boyfriend in philadelphia?

16:53.900 --> 16:55.700
No, i only told him
what sam told me.

16:55.800 --> 16:57.100
Sam told you?

16:57.400 --> 16:59.700
It's where she went before the wedding
and a few times after.

16:59.700 --> 17:01.700
But you're not sure
that's where she went.

17:01.900 --> 17:04.099
It's the only thing
that made sense.

17:04.300 --> 17:07.900
Melanie was a good person,
but melanie was...

17:08.300 --> 17:09.500
troubled.

17:09.599 --> 17:13.400
Sometimes when things got hard,
She'd go out and score, you know?

17:13.500 --> 17:16.400
Come home high, cuse sam
of ruining her life.

17:16.700 --> 17:18.300
He'd given her everything.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.599
Do you remember the name
of the boyfriend?

17:23.500 --> 17:25.300
Kevin henson.

17:25.700 --> 17:27.400
If something happened
to melanie,

17:27.500 --> 17:29.100
He's the one
who would know what.

17:29.200 --> 17:31.100
kevin henson--
Melanie's ex-Boyfriend.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.000
He's serving a year for meth
in south jersey.

17:33.100 --> 17:35.800
He went in just after the last payment
was made On the storage unit.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.800
He stops payment,
the storage guy finds her body.

17:37.900 --> 17:39.300
Quite a coincidence.

17:39.300 --> 17:42.300
??he was also on the outside
When her husband was whacked.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.900
Sounds like he's worth
a trip to south jersey.

17:48.100 --> 17:50.200
you ever been in love,
detective?

17:50.300 --> 17:52.300
It makes you do crazy things.

17:52.600 --> 17:54.100
Like kill someone?

17:55.400 --> 17:59.100
mel and i, when we were together,
time just stopped.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.300
But even the first day,

18:01.400 --> 18:04.100
her and me-- We both knew
it was never gonna work.

18:04.200 --> 18:07.100
God knows her folks were never
gonna let their little girl

18:07.400 --> 18:10.700
End up with some...
tatted-Up addict.

18:10.900 --> 18:13.000
But sometimes, see,

18:13.600 --> 18:16.700
Sometimes when we were alone
together...

18:17.200 --> 18:19.800
sometimes we almost believed.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.500
She was gonna leave sam.

18:24.800 --> 18:26.300
That's why she came
to see you.

18:26.400 --> 18:28.800
she found out he was having an affair.

18:35.400 --> 18:37.700
She thought he was gonna leave
her And get custody of the kids,

18:37.700 --> 18:39.300
you know, because of the drugs.

18:39.600 --> 18:42.400
She wanted me to go with her,
take the kids, just disappear.

18:42.500 --> 18:43.900
So what'd you do?

18:45.900 --> 18:47.100
Put her on a bus.

18:47.200 --> 18:48.700
You sent her away?

18:48.800 --> 18:51.100
What she wanted,
i couldn't give her.

18:52.400 --> 18:55.900
Checked into rehab the next day.
I thought if i could get clean...

18:57.100 --> 18:58.700
That's where i was
when she disappeared.

18:58.800 --> 19:00.500
By the time i got out,
she was dead.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.700
How could you be sure ???

19:01.800 --> 19:03.800
She stopped calling.

19:04.100 --> 19:06.700
If she was alive,
she would've called.

19:10.000 --> 19:12.500
Well, an affair
certainly explains a lot.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.200
Sam kills melanie,

19:14.200 --> 19:16.600
Or he and his lover
kill melanie together.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.200
We, then who kills sam?

19:18.300 --> 19:21.800
The lover, when sam backs out
after all she's done for him.

19:21.900 --> 19:23.700
It's not like she could go to
the police If he broke his promise.

19:23.700 --> 19:25.600
How do you come up
with these things, castle?

19:25.600 --> 19:28.200
I did not come up
with this one. They did.

19:29.000 --> 19:30.600
Okay, you speak "guy."

19:30.800 --> 19:33.800
If sam had a lover, would his
best friend know about it?

19:34.300 --> 19:35.500
Yes.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.100
- Detective.
- You lied to us, mr. Wyler.

19:47.200 --> 19:48.000
Excuse me?

19:48.000 --> 19:50.300
You don't think maybe it's relevant
your buddy sam Had an affair

19:50.300 --> 19:52.100
right about the time
melanie disappeared?

19:52.300 --> 19:53.700
That was a long time ago.

19:53.800 --> 19:55.900
What's the point of dragging
everybody through the mud?

19:56.000 --> 19:58.500
Haven't their kids been through enough?
Don't they deserve some peace?

19:58.500 --> 20:01.800
What they deserve is to know ???

20:06.000 --> 20:07.800
Elizabeth forte.

20:08.200 --> 20:12.200
Elizabeth forte is her name.
She worked with sam at his bank.

20:13.400 --> 20:17.400
???This is rick castle.

20:18.200 --> 20:19.600
Why am i here?

20:19.900 --> 20:22.700
Does the name samuel
kavanaugh ring a bell?

20:24.800 --> 20:26.200
What about him?

20:26.900 --> 20:30.700
We found the body
of his wife melanie.

20:30.900 --> 20:32.100
From the looks of it,
she was killed

20:32.100 --> 20:35.100
Somewhere around the time
the two of youWere having an affair.

20:37.300 --> 20:39.400
I'm afraid i don't know
what you mean.

20:40.200 --> 20:43.100
Do you really want me To start digging
around in your life, mrs. Forte?

20:43.100 --> 20:45.000
Because that's exactly
what i will do.

20:45.100 --> 20:46.700
I'll go through
your old phone records,

20:46.800 --> 20:48.400
Your credit card statements.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.600
I'll even talk to your husband
if i have to.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.800
Please.
Please don't do that.

20:54.300 --> 20:55.800
Gary doesn't know
anything about it.

20:55.900 --> 20:58.200
Just walk us through
what you know.

21:01.300 --> 21:04.600
I met sam When i got transferred
to the downtown branch.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.800
He was in new accounts.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.600
We were both pretty
unhappy at the time.

21:09.700 --> 21:10.800
How long was the affair?

21:10.900 --> 21:13.000
Not long. Six months.

21:13.100 --> 21:14.400
Why did it end?

21:14.600 --> 21:16.500
I realized i loved my hband.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.500
please.

21:17.600 --> 21:19.500
No one ends an affair because
they realize They're still in love.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.700
They end an affair
Because they're scared--

21:22.000 --> 21:24.300
Scared of taking it To the next level,
scared of being found out,

21:24.400 --> 21:26.400
Scared of ruining their life.

21:27.100 --> 21:31.900
So tell us, elizabeth,
what were you scared of?

21:34.200 --> 21:35.300
Him.

21:37.900 --> 21:39.700
I was scared of sam.

21:40.000 --> 21:41.000
Why?

21:41.000 --> 21:44.000
He started to ask me what i
would do If he wasn't with his wife,

21:44.100 --> 21:45.700
If she wasn't
in the picture anymore.

21:45.700 --> 21:46.800
And wh was that?

21:47.300 --> 21:49.500
A few weeks
before she disappeared.

21:49.900 --> 21:52.600
When i found out she was missing,
I broke things off.

21:52.700 --> 21:54.200
He became angry.

21:54.300 --> 21:57.600
It got so bad that i had
to transfer to another branch.

21:58.300 --> 22:01.000
You--I'm sorry.
You had to, uh...

22:08.100 --> 22:11.100
Five years,
mrs. Forte.

22:11.300 --> 22:14.000
Five whole years,

22:14.200 --> 22:15.700
and you never came forward?

22:15.800 --> 22:18.000
What's it matter
if sam killed melanie?

22:18.200 --> 22:22.000
He's dead. They're both dead.
What's it matter anymore?

22:46.200 --> 22:48.300
How'd you do it, sam?

23:05.500 --> 23:06.500
Ha ha!

23:07.300 --> 23:08.300
Ha!

23:08.600 --> 23:09.900
Run, rebel,

23:10.000 --> 23:12.400
but you'll never
defeat the forces of voltar.

23:12.500 --> 23:15.700
Aah! Death to voltar!
Death to the voltarians!

23:19.700 --> 23:21.700
I sense fear in you.

23:22.100 --> 23:23.800
you sense nothing!

23:26.200 --> 23:28.800
Has anyone seen my purse?

23:29.100 --> 23:32.000
Mom, we are totally doing battle
On the field of honor.

23:32.100 --> 23:33.300
How old are you?

23:33.400 --> 23:35.400
Old enough to afford
top-Of-The-Line laser tag.

23:35.500 --> 23:36.500
Ha!

23:37.600 --> 23:39.300
- i'm dead!
- Mom!

23:39.600 --> 23:41.600
Now voltar will never rule
the omniverse.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.600
Well...

23:44.500 --> 23:45.600
someone order food?

23:45.700 --> 23:46.800
-No.
-No.

23:47.700 --> 23:49.400
I better check this out.

23:51.900 --> 23:52.900
Hi?

23:54.100 --> 23:55.100
hi.

23:55.500 --> 23:57.100
- Who is it?
- Detective beckett.

23:57.100 --> 23:59.300
Darling,
are we entertaining?

23:59.300 --> 24:00.300
Um...

24:02.000 --> 24:03.000
- Dad.
- Yeah?

24:03.100 --> 24:04.200
Manners.

24:04.300 --> 24:05.300
Right.

24:06.900 --> 24:07.900
Come on in, please,

24:07.900 --> 24:11.100
- why don't you? Welcome...You bet.
- Thank you.
- Our house.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.000
mom,

24:15.600 --> 24:17.400
You, um, you remember
my mother martha.

24:17.400 --> 24:17.800
Oh.

24:17.800 --> 24:19.000
And alexis, of course.

24:19.000 --> 24:20.000
Hi.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.500
Yes. Hello.

24:24.800 --> 24:27.300
Can i...
make you a drink?

24:30.400 --> 24:31.400
Wow.

24:32.100 --> 24:33.300
I feel like...

24:33.800 --> 24:36.100
Alfred in the batcave
for the first time.

24:36.200 --> 24:39.500
Hmm... batman fan.
Figures.

24:39.600 --> 24:40.600
Why?

24:40.700 --> 24:44.400
Similar origin stories? Loss of a loved
one leads to a life of fighting crime.

24:44.600 --> 24:47.300
Yes, well, You are the
multimillionaire crime fighter.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.400
Yeah.

24:52.500 --> 24:55.800
That's, uh,
where i outline my books.

24:57.100 --> 24:58.100
Th's funny.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.500
Looks a lot like our...

25:01.100 --> 25:02.200
Murder board.

25:02.300 --> 25:05.000
Yeah, except mine's fake.

25:09.200 --> 25:10.300
Yeah.

25:11.100 --> 25:12.500
Something wrong?

25:14.100 --> 25:15.800
I can't find it.

25:16.200 --> 25:17.300
Find what?

25:17.600 --> 25:18.600
The answer.

25:19.200 --> 25:20.500
It was sam.

25:20.600 --> 25:22.100
Everything fits.
It's a good ending.

25:22.200 --> 25:25.300
Yeah, but without proof,
it's just a theory.

25:25.700 --> 25:28.800
And that family-- Those kids--
They need more than just a theory.

25:28.800 --> 25:31.600
They need to know.
i need to know.

25:32.000 --> 25:34.200
Well, you have an ending.

25:34.400 --> 25:37.400
You want the rest, you need to work
backwards. You need to finish the story.

25:37.500 --> 25:41.200
You have an ending.
You have your killer.

25:41.700 --> 25:44.400
You just have
to put it all together

25:44.600 --> 25:46.300
With the facts at hand.

25:46.500 --> 25:47.600
The facts?

25:47.800 --> 25:49.000
Fact--

25:50.100 --> 25:51.300
They had two small children.

25:51.400 --> 25:52.000
So?

25:52.100 --> 25:54.400
Based on police statements,
they didn't have a babysitter.

25:54.500 --> 25:55.800
With him at work,

25:56.000 --> 25:58.400
she would've had to have been
with the kids The day she disappeared.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.600
But sam said that
she left later that night.

26:00.700 --> 26:02.800
Which the doorman was
never able to corroborate.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.300
So if she was there ???

26:04.300 --> 26:06.100
Then she was murdered in the apartment.

26:06.200 --> 26:07.200
Yeah.

26:07.800 --> 26:09.800
Another fact--
He lived in manhattan.

26:09.900 --> 26:12.000
And like most people
He didn't own a car.

26:12.100 --> 26:17.000
So what is a good husband to do Living
in manhattan with his wife's body?

26:17.000 --> 26:19.800
He can't leave it in the apartment.
He can't walk out the lobby with it.

26:19.900 --> 26:20.900
So the only question is...

26:21.000 --> 26:23.400
how did he get the body
to the storage unit?

26:23.500 --> 26:24.700
He...

26:30.000 --> 26:31.100
Hey, could--No.

26:31.100 --> 26:33.200
Uh... n--

26:34.600 --> 26:36.200
- You know what helps?
- Yeah.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.400
Sometimes when
i'm trying to figure out

26:37.400 --> 26:41.000
How a character of mine does something,
I will walk the crime scene.

26:41.100 --> 26:42.400
This one time,
i was trying to figure out

26:42.400 --> 26:44.100
How to throw someone
off the empire state building,

26:44.100 --> 26:46.600
And that movie "sleepless
in seattle" had just come out.

26:46.700 --> 26:49.900
Oh, so many lonely women apoached me,
Thinking i was their tom hanks.

26:49.900 --> 26:51.200
- I got la--
- Castle.

26:52.400 --> 26:55.900
The point is, you want
to get into a killer's head,

26:56.400 --> 26:58.100
Go to where the killer was

26:58.200 --> 27:00.500
And see what problems
he had to face.

27:02.200 --> 27:03.300
Field trip?

27:03.500 --> 27:05.400
They told me
he was shot in a mugging,

27:05.500 --> 27:07.300
And now you're telling me
he was killed

27:07.400 --> 27:10.100
- Here in my apartment?
- not him. His wife.

27:10.200 --> 27:13.200
His wife?
What kind of family was this?

27:13.300 --> 27:15.500
All right. So you and i
are married.

27:15.700 --> 27:16.500
We are not married.

27:16.600 --> 27:18.100
Relax. It's just pretend.

27:18.200 --> 27:20.700
- I don't want to pretend.
- Scared you'll like it?

27:21.100 --> 27:23.800
Okay, if we're married,
i want a divorce.

27:23.800 --> 27:25.100
Are you two like this ???

27:25.100 --> 27:25.700
- Yes.
- Yes.

27:25.700 --> 27:28.800
All rig ht, we're not married,
but they were.

27:28.900 --> 27:32.300
Let's say the doorman's right.
Melanie gets home about 4:00.

27:32.600 --> 27:34.500
She'd have to make dinner
for the kids.

27:35.600 --> 27:38.000
Then sam comes home.

27:38.100 --> 27:40.100
Banker's hours.
Around 6:00.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.300
Figure the kids
have already eaten.

27:42.400 --> 27:45.200
So they're, what, um...
watching tv in the bedroom.

27:45.300 --> 27:47.200
- In my bedroom?
- Shh. We're on a roll.

27:47.300 --> 27:49.000
- They have a fight.
- About the affair.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.800
- About philadelphia.
- Things get heated.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.100
And she turns her head--

27:52.200 --> 27:54.200
He whacks her
with something.

27:54.300 --> 27:55.600
A pot.

27:55.800 --> 27:57.000
- Or a pan.
- Bam.

27:57.000 --> 27:58.700
Fractures her skull.
It's over.

27:58.800 --> 28:00.800
Except the kids
are still in the bedroom.

28:01.000 --> 28:05.000
He's got to figure out a was of getting her
Out of the apartment without them seeing.

28:07.100 --> 28:08.500
Hallway bathroom.

28:08.900 --> 28:10.300
He needed to buy time.

28:10.400 --> 28:13.600
Okay, so he, um... he puts
the body in the tub,

28:13.700 --> 28:15.400
- Closes the door...
- wait!

28:15.500 --> 28:17.700
And tells the kids
that mom went to the store.

28:17.800 --> 28:21.400
Whh, according to the case file,
he doorman was never able to substantiate.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.400
Okay, so no car.

28:22.400 --> 28:24.400
How does he get the body
out of the apartment?

28:24.600 --> 28:26.700
Maybe he hailed a cab.

28:26.900 --> 28:30.400
Yeah, maybe the cabbie and the doorman
Helped him stuff the body in the trunk.

28:30.500 --> 28:32.200
How much do you tip
for that these days?

28:32.300 --> 28:33.500
The doorman.

28:33.700 --> 28:34.700
Castle, i'm joking.

28:34.700 --> 28:37.300
What if the body was already
in the freezer

28:37.400 --> 28:38.700
When he took it out
of the apartment?

28:38.800 --> 28:41.200
Freezer? ???

28:41.900 --> 28:44.200
In my building, if you have
something picked up Or delivered,

28:44.200 --> 28:45.400
you have to sign for it.

28:45.500 --> 28:48.100
Yeah, here, too. A delivery that big,
you have to sign the ledger.

28:48.200 --> 28:48.900
The ledger?

28:49.000 --> 28:51.300
The doorman's ledger
downstairs.

28:56.600 --> 28:58.400
yeah,
that's my name.

29:00.300 --> 29:01.900
I know it was
five years ago, mrs. Marsh,

29:01.900 --> 29:05.100
But the only delivery
that day Was to your apartment.

29:05.200 --> 29:07.800
If you remember anything at all
about the delivery...

29:07.900 --> 29:11.700
I-I remember i had to go downstairs
And sort everything out.

29:11.800 --> 29:13.200
What do you mean
"sort everything out"?

29:13.300 --> 29:15.900
I told the doorman
i never ordered a freer.

29:16.100 --> 29:17.900
But the guy brought it on up.

29:17.900 --> 29:21.600
He loaded it on the freight elevator
While i was talking to the doorman.

29:21.700 --> 29:23.800
So what haened ???

29:24.500 --> 29:28.000
i told the doorman They
got the wrong apartment again.

29:28.100 --> 29:31.600
And then by the time i got
back upstairs, the guy was gone.

29:31.800 --> 29:34.300
Does this have anything to do
with that missing woman?

29:35.000 --> 29:36.000
Yeah, it does.

29:36.000 --> 29:37.700
Yeah, 'cause i already told
the other cop.

29:37.800 --> 29:38.900
Detective sloan?

29:39.000 --> 29:42.400
I don't know his name, but i told
him everything, Same as you.

29:42.600 --> 29:43.500
i don't get it.

29:43.500 --> 29:46.100
If sloan had that woman's report,
Why didn't he just follow up?

29:46.200 --> 29:49.700
He wasn't looking ???
He'd already written it.

29:53.600 --> 29:56.400
that's the same kind of truck
We saw outside charles wyler's store.

29:56.600 --> 29:58.600
He must have a contract with them.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.800
If you wanted some help with some
heavy lifting, Who would you call?

30:02.100 --> 30:04.100
Your best friend.

30:08.200 --> 30:11.400
we can trace the rental Of the
delivery truck to you, mr. Wyler.

30:11.500 --> 30:14.700
If you want, I can bring the lady you
delivered the freezer to In to identify you.

30:14.800 --> 30:16.900
Look, i had nothing to do
with what happened to melanie.

30:17.000 --> 30:19.000
You lied about everything else.
Why not about this?

30:19.100 --> 30:21.000
I never had any reason ???

30:21.100 --> 30:23.000
But sam did, right?

30:23.500 --> 30:27.100
I mean, she kept going back To her
ex-Boyfriend. How much can a guy take?

30:32.200 --> 30:33.900
He called me that night.

30:34.600 --> 30:36.500
He said...

30:37.400 --> 30:39.500
He needed me
to come over right away.

30:39.600 --> 30:42.900
When i got there, the kids were asleep,
And melanie was in the tub...

30:44.100 --> 30:46.000
In a garment bag.

30:46.800 --> 30:49.200
He said she came at him,
and he just snapped.

30:49.400 --> 30:50.700
Here's an idea--

30:50.900 --> 30:54.700
Instead of killing her,
why not just get a divorce?

30:54.800 --> 30:56.900
You don't think i know
how wrong this was?

30:57.000 --> 30:59.100
Why did you take the risk?
Why did you move that body?

30:59.300 --> 31:03.100
Because he made
a very bad mistake.

31:03.500 --> 31:06.500
And what about the kids? Their mom
is dead. If he goes to prison...

31:09.900 --> 31:11.300
So you arranged
for the truck.

31:11.700 --> 31:14.000
He said it could never be
traced back to him.

31:14.200 --> 31:16.400
That's why we sent the freezer
to the old lady,

31:16.500 --> 31:18.600
That's why i rented out
the storage space--

31:18.800 --> 31:20.900
Because we knew the cops
would look at sam.

31:21.300 --> 31:22.800
You made the payments?

31:23.000 --> 31:24.900
Sam couldn't take any chances.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.900
He'd give me the cash,
and i'd...

31:27.100 --> 31:28.700
Stop by twice a year.

31:28.800 --> 31:30.500
For five years.

31:31.800 --> 31:34.100
It seemed a lot easier
than moving her.

31:35.100 --> 31:36.400
Why did you stop paying?

31:36.500 --> 31:40.000
Look, i'm truly sorry
about what happened to melanie.

31:40.300 --> 31:44.200
But what was i supposed to do,
Keep paying for the rest of my life?

31:44.500 --> 31:48.100
The d.A. Will make sure
of that, mr. Wyler.

31:57.200 --> 32:00.800
Her body gets dumped Because this guy
wyler didn't pay a bill? That's...

32:00.900 --> 32:03.200
you can say it.
Pretty cold.

32:03.500 --> 32:07.300
Ironic that such a selfish act
ultimately revealed the truth.

32:07.500 --> 32:09.700
There were people
who knew the truth all along.

32:09.800 --> 32:12.100
They just chose
not to come forward.

32:12.200 --> 32:15.000
Still, karma comes back And
puts a cap in her husband's ass.

32:15.200 --> 32:17.200
So all is right
with the wld.

32:24.800 --> 32:28.800
I'm gonna go talk to melanie's parents,
Let 'em know how this all shook out.

32:29.300 --> 32:30.500
You wanna come?

32:30.800 --> 32:34.400
The woman with the freezer delivery
Told us she talked to a cop.

32:34.700 --> 32:36.200
Yeah. Sloan.

32:36.300 --> 32:38.300
Only he didn't list
her name in his report.

32:38.400 --> 32:39.900
He didn't feel
that it was important.

32:39.900 --> 32:42.300
After all, he didn't believe
he was looking at a murder.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.400
Right,

32:43.500 --> 32:47.000
so if you're not
investigating a murder,

32:47.000 --> 32:50.500
Why would you talk to the neighbor
About a freezer delivery?

32:53.000 --> 32:54.800
this must be some freezer.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.600
You mentioned
a police officer, mrs. Marsh.

32:57.700 --> 33:00.800
- I know it's been five years, but do you--
- I ver said ???

33:00.900 --> 33:02.000
When did he come see you?

33:02.100 --> 33:03.500
Last year sometime.

33:03.600 --> 33:06.200
I remember thinking, why is
this cop asking me questions

33:06.200 --> 33:07.900
About a freezer i never ordered?

33:08.000 --> 33:10.400
Do you remember anything About
the man who came to see you?

33:10.500 --> 33:12.000
Uh, he was older.

33:12.100 --> 33:14.900
- Uniform?
- No. Plainclothes like you.

33:15.400 --> 33:18.600
He had gray hair,
and he walked with a limp.

33:19.800 --> 33:22.200
- Ben davidson.
- Melanie's dad.

33:31.900 --> 33:33.600
You could just leave it like this.

33:35.700 --> 33:37.000
Sam's dead.

33:37.800 --> 33:39.600
The captain's happy.

33:40.100 --> 33:42.200
Those kids
look pretty happy.

33:43.700 --> 33:47.200
That's the difference Between
a novel and the real world, castle.

33:48.700 --> 33:51.800
A cop doesn't get to
decide how the story ends.

34:15.199 --> 34:16.300
Detective beckett.

34:16.400 --> 34:19.000
Sir, i'm gonna have to take you
with me down to the station.

34:19.100 --> 34:20.600
Who is it, honey?

34:22.699 --> 34:24.600
- Uh...
- what is it, ben?

34:35.000 --> 34:38.000
So i'm here because i questioned
a woman about a freezer?

34:38.100 --> 34:39.800
Not any freezer,
mr. Davidson.

34:39.900 --> 34:43.300
The freezer that your
daughter's body was stored in.

34:45.699 --> 34:49.300
For the moment, let's--
Let's assume what you say is true.

34:50.600 --> 34:51.699
What's the charge?

34:51.800 --> 34:56.900
If mrs. Marsh's answer led to sam's death,
Then the charge would be murder.

34:58.000 --> 35:01.000
I kept going over everything sam said,

35:01.200 --> 35:04.400
Everything he claimed
happened that night,

35:05.000 --> 35:08.600
Until i came to the same conclusion
That you both apparently did--

35:08.800 --> 35:11.700
That melanie never left
her apartment alive.

35:12.100 --> 35:15.700
Mrs. Marsh's answers merely
confirmed what i already knew.

35:16.200 --> 35:18.300
That your son-In-Law was a killer.

35:18.700 --> 35:21.400
if you had figured out
what sam had done,

35:21.500 --> 35:22.600
Why not just go to the police?

35:22.600 --> 35:24.300
He would've gone to prison
for the rest of his life.

35:24.300 --> 35:26.300
If he'd been convicted.

35:27.000 --> 35:30.500
They didn't have a-A body
at the time, remember?

35:30.600 --> 35:33.800
His lawyers would've
put melanie on trial, not him.

35:33.900 --> 35:36.400
So you took matters
into your own hands.

35:39.200 --> 35:42.700
Well, you can certainly understand
How a father might want to,

35:44.400 --> 35:47.000
How he might follow
his daughter's murderer

35:47.100 --> 35:50.500
One dark night when he was sure
no other people would be around,

35:50.900 --> 35:54.600
How he might confront him With
a gun he'd brought back from the war,

35:56.700 --> 36:01.200
Might even promise forgiveness
in exchange for the truth.

36:02.900 --> 36:05.600
And hearing his admission...

36:08.100 --> 36:10.300
Be overcome with rage.

36:12.400 --> 36:14.900
Every time he brought the girls
to see us,

36:15.600 --> 36:19.100
I watched a little piece
of my wife die.

36:20.100 --> 36:23.300
A visit from your grandkids
should be life-Affirming,

36:23.400 --> 36:26.600
Not a reminder of how
your only child was murdered.

36:32.300 --> 36:34.400
Killing him wasn't the answer.

36:36.600 --> 36:39.000
I never said i killed him.

36:39.700 --> 36:43.200
I said a father
might be justified.

36:46.400 --> 36:49.000
The police told me
sam was shot in a robbery,

36:49.800 --> 36:52.400
And without evidce,
there'd be little chance That his

36:52.500 --> 36:54.800
killer would ever
be brought to justice.

36:58.700 --> 37:01.700
So i guess we'll find out
if that's really true.

37:07.200 --> 37:10.200
And i'd like to see a-
A lawyer if i could.

37:21.400 --> 37:23.800
No, sweetie, I just wanted to
make sure i said good night.

37:24.400 --> 37:27.100
You got it. Strawberry
happy face pancakes on me.

37:27.300 --> 37:29.700
Mwah. Later.

37:31.900 --> 37:33.600
Alexis missed me.

37:34.400 --> 37:35.800
How did you know?

37:36.200 --> 37:38.200
- Spidey sense.
- Hmm.

37:41.800 --> 37:45.500
By the way, it was
my mother, Not my father.

37:50.300 --> 37:53.500
We were supposed to go to
dinner together--My mom, my dad and i--

37:53.500 --> 37:57.500
And she was gonna meet us at
the restaurant, But she never showed.

37:59.300 --> 38:01.900
Two hours later, we went home.

38:02.200 --> 38:04.100
And there was a detective
waiting for us.

38:04.100 --> 38:07.200
Detective raglin.

38:11.200 --> 38:13.600
They found her body.

38:13.900 --> 38:16.400
She had been stabbed.

38:17.500 --> 38:18.800
A robbery?

38:20.800 --> 38:22.000
No.

38:24.100 --> 38:28.100
She still had her money
and purse and jewelry.

38:28.900 --> 38:31.500
And it wasn't a sexual assault, either.

38:33.400 --> 38:35.900
They attributed it
to gang violence.

38:36.300 --> 38:38.300
Random wayward event.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.300
So just like in melanie's case,

38:42.400 --> 38:44.600
They couldn't think
outside the box.

38:45.300 --> 38:47.900
So they just tried
to package it up nicely,

38:48.300 --> 38:50.300
And the killer was never caught.

38:53.700 --> 38:55.700
Why do you wear the watch?

38:58.000 --> 39:00.000
My dad took her death hard.

39:02.000 --> 39:04.800
He's sober now.
Five years.

39:06.900 --> 39:10.900
So... This is for
the life that i saved,

39:12.200 --> 39:13.400
And...

39:15.000 --> 39:19.000
This is for the life that i lost.

39:21.200 --> 39:22.400
So...

39:23.400 --> 39:27.400
I guess your nikki heat
has a backstory now, castle.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.500
I don't know. Um...

39:31.400 --> 39:34.600
i did kinda like The hooker-By-Day,
cop-By-Night thing.

39:35.200 --> 39:36.400
But, uh...

39:37.600 --> 39:41.500
I guess a heavy emotional
angle could work, too.

39:41.600 --> 39:42.600
Well...

39:43.200 --> 39:47.900
Don't bewilder your audiences with
substance On my account, castle.

39:50.200 --> 39:52.100
Until tomorrow, detective.

39:53.500 --> 39:54.900
You can't just say "night"?

39:55.000 --> 39:57.500
I'm a writer.
"Night" is boring.

39:57.700 --> 40:01.500
"Until tomorrow"
is more... hopeful.

40:01.600 --> 40:02.700
Yeah, well...

40:03.500 --> 40:05.300
I'm a cop.

40:05.800 --> 40:07.000
Night.

40:14.900 --> 40:16.100
Night.

40:49.400 --> 40:50.600
Hi, dad.

41:02.200 --> 41:04.800
Remember,
this never happened.

41:05.200 --> 41:06.700
I was never here.

41:06.900 --> 41:08.700
You have my word.

41:09.800 --> 41:11.200
Thanks.

41:14.500 --> 41:16.300
If you tell her i did this,

41:16.500 --> 41:18.100
I will make you bleed.

41:18.600 --> 41:19.800
Understood.

41:20.500 --> 41:22.200
Good luck.
