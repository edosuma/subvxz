I'M TROLLING FOR CASES.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.602
LAST NIGHT, A GUY
CRASHED HIS MOTORCYCLE,

09:31.602 --> 09:33.744
HAD REBAR JAMMED IN THE BASE
OF HIS SKULL,

09:33.744 --> 09:36.246
AND SHADOW SHEPHERD
LET ME DO THE EXTRACTION.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING?

09:36.246 --> 09:38.979
PAPERWORK. YOU KNOW WHAT I HAVE
TO LOOK FORWARD TO TODAY?

09:38.979 --> 09:40.981
MORE PAPERWORK.
THIS JOB IS JUST--

09:40.981 --> 09:42.983
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE SOMETHING
JAMMED IN MY BRAIN.

09:42.983 --> 09:45.656
THAT WAY, I'D SEE
THE INSIDE OF AN O.R.

09:45.656 --> 09:46.917
OKAY.

09:46.917 --> 09:49.359
WELL, UH, ARE YOU GONNA
COME HOME EARLY TONIGHT?

09:49.359 --> 09:52.262
BECAUSE WE CAN ORDER IN, AND I
HAVE SOME STUFF TO TELL YOU.

09:52.262 --> 09:54.224
YEAH. I'LL BE THERE.

09:57.027 --> 10:00.100
I HAVE TO GO.
I'M ON SLOAN'S POST-OPS.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.933
I HATE THAT YOU'RE SO HAPPY.

10:02.933 --> 10:06.076
DEREK, THERE'S GONNA BE A LOT
OF DIRTY SEX FOR YOU TONIGHT.

10:06.076 --> 10:08.308
LOOK FORWARD TO THAT.

10:08.308 --> 10:09.910
(door closes)

10:09.910 --> 10:11.041
HMM.

10:11.041 --> 10:12.713
HMM.

10:12.713 --> 10:15.615
I'M LOOKING AT INJURIES TO
THE PULMONARY ARTERY AND VEIN.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.217
HOLD PRESSURE IN THERE.
(Jackson) MORE LAP BANDS.

10:17.217 --> 10:19.950
LET'S TRY A TEMPORARY
SATINSKY CLAMP.

10:19.950 --> 10:22.753
DR. ALTMAN, MR. LINEHAN
HAS HEMOLYTIC ANEMIA

10:22.753 --> 10:24.955
AND ELEVATED L.D.H.

10:24.955 --> 10:26.927
I SUSPECT
POST-OPERATIVE T.T.P.

10:26.927 --> 10:29.660
SHALL I START
EXCHANGE PLASMAPHERESIS?
YES. GOOD CATCH, CRISTINA.

10:29.660 --> 10:32.332
HOLD ON, DR. YANG. WE NEED
TO OPEN UP THE PERICARDIUM

10:32.332 --> 10:34.264
TO GAIN PROXIMAL CONTROL.

10:34.264 --> 10:35.866
DR. YANG SHOULD SCRUB IN.

10:35.866 --> 10:37.868
AND MR. LINEHAN CAN WAIT
FOR AN HOUR.

10:37.868 --> 10:42.412
UH, NO, THANK YOU.
I'D RATHER NOT SCRUB IN.

10:42.412 --> 10:44.114
KEEP THIS STABLE.

10:44.114 --> 10:47.017
DR. ALTMAN,
I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

10:47.017 --> 10:48.819
CRISTINA--

10:48.819 --> 10:50.821
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU PURSUED ME. I DIDN'T--

10:50.821 --> 10:53.223
I GAVE YOU AN OUT,
AND YOU PURSUED ME.

10:53.223 --> 10:55.025
YOU SAID--YOU SAID--
AND I STILL--

10:55.025 --> 10:58.288
DO YOU LOVE HER?
OR DO YOU LOVE ME?

YOU LEARN IN MED SCHOOL HOW MANY

YOU DON'T GET
HOW M--HOW MUCH BLOOD--

12:25.475 --> 12:27.818

12:27.818 --> 12:29.820

WHAT'S THE PROCEDURE? YOU'RE
THE HEAD OF HOSPITAL SECURITY.

14:09.219 --> 14:12.953
HOW DO YOU NOT KNOW? I KNOW
IT'S NEVER HAPPENED BEFORE.

14:12.953 --> 14:15.455
OH, I FOUND IT. LOCKDOWN.
NOBODY MOVES IN OR OUT.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.057
YEAH. NOBODY MOVES,
NOBODY BREATHES

14:17.057 --> 14:19.389
UNTIL WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON.

14:19.389 --> 14:21.531
HERE.

14:21.531 --> 14:23.263
THE POLICE
ARE ALMOST HERE.

14:23.263 --> 14:25.865
I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU HERE. YOU
GONNA BE OKAY BY YOURSELF?

14:25.865 --> 14:28.398
YOU'RE LEAVING? YOU--YOU JUST
SAID THAT--THAT NOBODY LEAVES,

14:28.398 --> 14:30.400
NOBODY MOVES, NOBODY BREATHES.
NOBODY BUT ME.

14:30.400 --> 14:32.642
I'M THE CHIEF.
THIS IS MY HOSPITAL.

14:32.642 --> 14:35.976
BUT WHAT IF YOU GET SHOT
OR--OR--
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.
I'M THE CHIEF.

15:01.031 --> 15:04.234
UH, JASON PERKINS?
UH, I GOT THE CHART HERE
SOMEWHERE.

15:04.234 --> 15:07.177
PEDS.
CAN YOU PAGE THE YOUNGER
DR. GREY FOR ME

15:07.177 --> 15:10.240
AND TELL HER TO GET
MY APPY MOVING?
WE'RE ON LOCKDOWN.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.242
WHAT? WHY?

15:12.242 --> 15:15.315
OH, COME ON.
WELL, IT'S A JOKE, RIGHT?
IT'S A DRILL OR SOMETHING?

15:15.315 --> 15:17.187
(pagers beeping)

15:17.187 --> 15:19.149
(Arizona) OKAY.
IT'S NO JOKE.

15:19.149 --> 15:21.621
EVERYONE. EVERYONE.

15:21.621 --> 15:24.094
WE'RE SEALING THE FLOOR.

15:24.094 --> 15:26.496
I DON'T KNOW WHY,
AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHY,

15:26.496 --> 15:28.959
BUT NOBODY GOES IN OR OUT
PAST THE DOUBLE DOORS.

15:28.959 --> 15:31.061
YOU CHECK ON YOUR OWN PATIENTS,
AND THEN YOU COME BACK

15:31.061 --> 15:33.063
AND CHECK AND SEE IF THERE'S
ANY OTHERS IN THE QUEUE.

15:33.063 --> 15:34.534
WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF HANDS ON DECK.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.507
AND, PEOPLE, DO NOT ALARM
THE MAKERS OF THE TINY HUMANS.

15:37.507 --> 15:40.040
THEY WILL EAT YOU ALIVE.
(woman) LET'S GO.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.342
I REALLY THOUGHT
THAT WAS A JOKE.
(chuckles) A SICK JOKE.

15:42.342 --> 15:44.514
EXCUSE ME?
UH, NOTHING.

15:44.514 --> 15:46.116
(scoffs) WHAT?

15:46.116 --> 15:48.518
WHAT, YOU CAN'T BE STUCK
ON THE SAME FLOOR AS ME?

15:48.518 --> 15:52.152
THAT'S A HARDSHIP FOR YOU?
UH, YEAH. FRANKLY, IT IS.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.254
HEY. HOW ARE WE?

15:54.254 --> 15:56.386
BILL HASN'T COME BACK
WITH MY PIZZA YET,

15:56.386 --> 15:58.388
SO STILL STARVING.
(laughs)

15:58.388 --> 16:00.660
BUT FULL OF FRESH BLOOD,

16:00.660 --> 16:02.732
WHICH IS DISGUSTING,
LIKE I'M A VAMPIRE.

16:02.732 --> 16:05.235
MARY,
YOU COMPLAIN TOO MUCH.

16:05.235 --> 16:07.137
BUT I DO IT WITH A SMILE.

16:07.137 --> 16:09.139
(chuckles) FACE IT.
I'M AN AWESOME PATIENT.

16:09.139 --> 16:11.071
I MAKE YOUR DAY.

16:11.071 --> 16:14.004
(pager beeps)
HMM. (whispers) LET'S SEE.

16:14.004 --> 16:15.545
WHAT'S WRONG?

16:15.545 --> 16:19.409
NOTHING.
J-JUST A... PAGE.

16:19.409 --> 16:21.681
(Teddy) I CAN'T GET CONTROL
OF THIS ARTERY.
HE'S CRASHING.

16:21.681 --> 16:24.514
ALL RIGHT, I NEED MORE LIGHT
AND ANOTHER CLAMP.
(monitor beeping erratically)

16:24.514 --> 16:26.286
HOW'S IT GOING IN HERE?

16:26.286 --> 16:27.687
TOUCH AND GO.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.619
AVERY, YOU GOT A SECOND?

16:29.619 --> 16:31.561
(beeping continues)

16:31.561 --> 16:33.293
HAS ANYBODY
CHECKED THEIR PAGER?

16:33.293 --> 16:34.664
NO, WE'VE BEEN TOO BUSY.

16:34.664 --> 16:37.127
THERE'S A SHOOTER
IN THE HOSPITAL.

16:37.127 --> 16:40.130
I DON'T WANT YOU TO SAY A WORD.
WHEN THE PATIENT IS STABLE...

16:40.130 --> 16:42.132
I WANT YOU TO TELL
HUNT AND ALTMAN

16:42.132 --> 16:45.475
THAT NOBODY GOES OUT OF HERE
UNTIL THEY ARE TOLD.

16:45.475 --> 16:47.177
CAN YOU HANDLE THIS?

16:47.177 --> 16:50.210
YES, SIR.

16:50.210 --> 16:52.412
ALL RIGHT.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.284
(beeping continues)

16:54.284 --> 16:56.286
(Owen) OKAY.
OKAY, B.P. IS DROPPING.

16:56.286 --> 16:58.288
I'VE ALMOST GOT THE PULMONARY
ARTERY UNDER CONTROL.

16:58.288 --> 17:00.750
JUST GIVE ME ONE MORE SECOND.
WHAT DID SHEPHERD WANT?

17:00.750 --> 17:03.293
(exhales)
DR. AVERY?

17:03.293 --> 17:06.296
NOTHING. UM, JUST WANTED
TO KNOW HOW LONG WE'D BE.

17:06.296 --> 17:08.298
HE NEEDS THE O.R. NEXT.
OKAY, GET IN HERE

17:08.298 --> 17:11.361
AND SUCTION AROUND
WHERE DR. ALTMAN'S WORKING.

17:11.361 --> 17:15.205
(beeping continues)

17:15.205 --> 17:17.567
SHAKY HANDS, DR. AVERY?

17:17.567 --> 17:19.339
WON'T MAKE IT AS A SURGEON

17:19.339 --> 17:23.042
IF YOU CAN'T KEEP
YOUR HANDS STEADY.
YES, SIR.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.148
HEY.

17:29.619 --> 17:32.682
DID YOU GET THAT PAGE?
LOCKDOWN?

17:32.682 --> 17:35.285
YEAH. I MEAN, WHATEVER.
IT MEANS WE CAN'T LEAVE.

17:35.285 --> 17:37.687
I NEVER LEAVE HERE ANYWAY
SO WHAT DO I CARE?
(laughs)

17:37.687 --> 17:40.190
YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S PROBABLY JUST A DRILL.

17:40.190 --> 17:42.292
OR, LIKE,
A PSYCH PATIENT GOT OUT

17:42.292 --> 17:44.564
OR A BABY WENT MISSING
FROM THE NURSERY...

17:44.564 --> 17:48.168
OR THERE'S A--THERE'S
AN AX MURDERER ON THE LOOSE.
AX MURDERER WOULD BE FUN.

17:48.168 --> 17:50.470
MM-HMM. SO?
HOW DID HE REACT?

17:50.470 --> 17:52.472
I MEAN, WAS HIS WORLD
MADE WHOLE

17:52.472 --> 17:55.175
BECAUSE YOUR WOMB
IS NOT EMPTY AND DRY?

17:55.175 --> 17:58.448
DID HE WEEP
LIKE A BITCH BABY?
I DIDN'T TELL HIM
BECAUSE HE WAS IN A MOOD.

17:58.448 --> 18:01.151
SO I'LL TELL HIM
LATER TONIGHT OR SOMETHING.

18:01.151 --> 18:03.453
I MEAN, IT SHOULD BE SPECIAL,
RIGHT?
WELL, I MEAN,
YOU FOUND OUT

18:03.453 --> 18:05.455
IN THE LADIES ROOM
SQUATTING OVER A STICK.

18:05.455 --> 18:07.357
I MEAN,
THAT WASN'T VERY SPECIAL.

18:07.357 --> 18:10.220
WHY DOES HE GET SPECIAL?
I DON'T KNOW. I FEEL LIKE
MY HEAD'S GONNA POP OFF

18:10.220 --> 18:13.663
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T TOLD HIM
AND I WANT TO AND I HATE THAT.

18:13.663 --> 18:16.326
IT'S GOOD NEWS.
HE SHOULD KNOW, RIGHT?
MM-HMM.

18:16.326 --> 18:19.169
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M TELLING HIM NOW.
OKAY.

18:19.169 --> 18:21.231
WHAT--
WELL, I'M COMING.

18:21.231 --> 18:23.573
WELL, I WANT TO SEE
THE BITCH BABY TEARS.

18:23.573 --> 18:26.506
CRISTINA--
I'LL JUST STAND IN THE HALLWAY.
HE'LL NEVER KNOW I'M THERE.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.208
I, UM...

18:29.679 --> 18:31.881
I-I BROKE UP WITH OWEN.
OKAY?

18:31.881 --> 18:33.443
OH.

18:33.443 --> 18:34.784
OKAY.

18:34.784 --> 18:36.386
COME ON.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.320
THEY WANT ATTENDING APPROVAL

18:40.320 --> 18:42.322
TO DO THE AUDITORY
EVOKED POTENTIALS.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.154
CAN YOU SIGN FOR IT?

18:44.154 --> 18:46.726
LOCKDOWN. KINDA CRAZY, RIGHT?
YOU THINK IT'S, UH, SERIOUS?

18:46.726 --> 18:49.128
CAN YOU JUST SIGN THE ORDER?
THIS KAREV THING SERIOUS?

18:49.128 --> 18:50.660
MARK.
I MISS YOU.

18:50.660 --> 18:52.562
CAN YOU JUST SIGN THE ORDER?

18:52.562 --> 18:54.634
SIR, YOU CAN'T LEAVE
THIS AREA. THE HOSPITAL IS IN--

18:54.634 --> 18:55.735
(gunfire)

18:55.735 --> 18:58.168

19:03.343 --> 19:05.645

19:05.645 --> 19:07.447
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.849
NO, NO. VIVIAN.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.521

SHE'S DEAD. SHE'S--

19:11.521 --> 19:14.224
I'M GETTING YOU OUT OF HERE.

19:14.224 --> 19:17.427

19:19.829 --> 19:22.292
COME ON! COME ON!
(elevator bell dings)

19:22.292 --> 19:24.794
(Lexie panting)

19:24.794 --> 19:28.638
(indistinct screaming)

19:39.379 --> 19:41.611
(people speaking indistinctly)

19:41.611 --> 19:44.914
(siren whoops)
(man) GO CORNER TO CORNER.

19:44.914 --> 19:47.217
(man speaks indistinctly)

19:47.217 --> 19:50.490
(man speaks indistinctly)

19:50.490 --> 19:53.393
(siren wails)
EXCUSE ME.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.626
...COUPLE GUYS
AND GO AROUND.

19:56.626 --> 19:59.329
HAVE YOU TALKED TO
THE ADMINISTRATOR?
(man) NO, SIR.

19:59.329 --> 20:01.471
OFFICER,
WHAT'S THE SITUATION?
SIR, YOU GOTTA STAND BACK.

20:01.471 --> 20:03.473
LOOK, I'M RICHARD WEBBER.
I'M--I'M THE CHIEF--

20:03.473 --> 20:04.874
I'M THE FORMER--

20:04.874 --> 20:07.206
LOOK, THIS IS MY HOSPITAL.
WHAT'S GOING ON?

20:07.206 --> 20:09.709
A SHOOTER TOOK DOWN
ONE OF THE DOCTORS.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.842
AND WE'RE NOT SURE WHETHER
OR NOT HE'S STILL INSIDE.

20:12.842 --> 20:14.884
NO, SIR, SIR, SIR.
NO ONE IN, NO ONE OUT.

20:14.884 --> 20:17.447
THE--THE S.W.A.T. TEAM
IS ON THE WAY, SIR.

20:17.447 --> 20:20.290
NO ONE IN, NO ONE OUT.
ARE YOU EVACUATING PEOPLE? ARE
YOU GETTING THEM OUT OF THERE?

20:20.290 --> 20:22.952
BECAUSE--
DEPARTMENT POLICY
IS A LOCKDOWN.

20:22.952 --> 20:24.594
UNTIL WE KNOW
WHO THE SHOOTER IS,

20:24.594 --> 20:27.226
WHERE THE SHOOTER IS, EVERYONE
STAYS IN THE SAME PLACE.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.899
IT'S SAFER THAT WAY.
THOSE ARE MY PEOPLE IN THERE.
IF SOMEONE IS SHOOTING, I'D--

20:29.899 --> 20:33.433
MY GUYS HAVE THIS. WE DO.
WE'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF IT.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.305
OKAY?

20:35.305 --> 20:37.767
(helicopter blades whirring)
OKAY.

20:37.767 --> 20:39.369
(sirens wailing)

20:39.369 --> 20:40.770
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT HAPPENED?

20:40.770 --> 20:44.544
(people speaking indistinctly)

20:49.349 --> 20:50.950
(Alex groaning)

20:50.950 --> 20:52.852
I GRABBED EVERYTHING
I COULD THINK OF.

20:52.852 --> 20:55.024
I AM... SO...

20:55.024 --> 20:57.327
INCREDIBLY PISSED OFF
RIGHT NOW.

20:57.327 --> 20:59.689
ALEX, YOU'VE BEEN SHOT.
WE HAVE TO GET HIM
OUT OF HERE.

20:59.689 --> 21:03.833
HE COULD COME BACK, MARK.
WE HAVE TO GET HIM OUT OF HERE.
THERE'S NO EXIT WOUND.

21:03.833 --> 21:05.935
NO EXIT WOUND.
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FLIP HIM.

21:05.935 --> 21:07.967
LEXIE, GRAB HIM
UNDER THE SHOULDERS.
WE HAVE TO GET HIM OUTTA HERE.

21:07.967 --> 21:10.940
WE HAVE TO GET HIM OUTTA HERE.
LEXIE, HE'S LOSING BLOOD.
WE CAN'T MOVE HIM.

21:10.940 --> 21:12.802
(Alex moans and grunts)
NOW SHUT UP AND HELP.

21:12.802 --> 21:14.644
AH. OH.

21:14.644 --> 21:16.646
(panting)
NOTHING.

21:16.646 --> 21:18.948
OH, DAMN. THE BULLET'S
STILL IN THERE SOMEWHERE.

21:18.948 --> 21:21.050
(moaning)
WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
WING IT. START AN I.V.

21:21.050 --> 21:24.384
I'LL SET UP A CHEST TUBE.
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY, ALEX.
ALL RIGHT?

21:24.384 --> 21:25.815
I'M--I'M--

21:25.815 --> 21:29.919
I'M GONNA KICK THAT GUY'S ASS
WHEN I SEE HIM.

21:29.919 --> 21:31.891
(grunts and gasps)

21:31.891 --> 21:34.494
HAS ANYBODY SEEN
OLIVIA KAGAN'S CHART?

21:34.494 --> 21:36.966
UH, I NEED ALBUTEROL NEBS
FOR THE ASTHMA KID.

21:36.966 --> 21:39.799
IT'S TIME FOR 18's DOSE OF
CEFTRIAXONE. 34 NEEDS HIS MOMMY.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.402
AND THE KID IN 35
WON'T STOP CRYING.
WE HAVE, WHAT, 42 KIDS,

21:42.402 --> 21:44.504
FOUR DOCTORS AND NINE NURSES?
IT'S NOT ENOUGH.
ALL RIGHT.

21:44.504 --> 21:46.506
WHY DON'T YOU JUST PUT
ALL THE KIDS IN THE PLAYROOM?

21:46.506 --> 21:48.307
I MEAN, WE DON'T HAVE
ENOUGH STAFF FOR A WHOLE FLOOR.

21:48.307 --> 21:51.381
SO AT LEAST THEY'LL ALL BE
IN ONE PLACE, ONE BIG ROOM.

21:51.381 --> 21:54.714
WE CAN KEEP AN EYE
ON ALL THE KIDS AT ONCE.
YOU CAN'T PUT A BUNCH
OF SICK KIDS IN THE PLAYROOM

21:54.714 --> 21:57.687
WITH THEIR BEDS
AND EVERYTHING--
N-SURE--SURE WE CAN.
STABLE ONES CAN WALK,

21:57.687 --> 22:00.790
AND WE HAVE WHEELCHAIRS,
SO LET'S DO IT. MOVE.

22:00.790 --> 22:03.723
THANKS.
WHATEVER. (sighs)

22:03.723 --> 22:05.725
WELL, DO YOU WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT?

22:05.725 --> 22:07.326
NO.
OWEN, I MEAN.

22:07.326 --> 22:09.729
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
I DON'T WANT TO--

22:09.729 --> 22:12.662
I, UM, I-I CAN'T.
IT'S JUST...

22:12.662 --> 22:15.865
OKAY, HE DOESN'T KNOW,
YOU KNOW, WHO HE LOVES,

22:15.865 --> 22:18.007
AND IF IT'S NOT ME, THEN...

22:18.007 --> 22:20.009
I DON'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

22:20.009 --> 22:22.341
LET'S TALK ABOUT
SOMETHING ELSE.
OKAY.

22:22.341 --> 22:24.874
YOU REALIZE, YOU'RE ABOUT
TO BE A GODMOTHER?

22:24.874 --> 22:26.816
I'M GODMOTHER?
(laughs)

22:26.816 --> 22:29.819
OKAY, WHAT DO I HAVE TO DO?
LIKE, TALK GOD TO THE FETUS?

22:29.819 --> 22:32.782
'CAUSE I'M NOT GONNA DO THAT.
IT MEANS, YOU TAKE CARE
OF THE KID IF I DIE.

22:32.782 --> 22:34.784
DEREK TAKES CARE
OF THE KID IF YOU DIE.

22:34.784 --> 22:36.786
IF WE DIE, IF WE DIE.

22:36.786 --> 22:38.388
OKAY, SO... (chuckles)

22:38.388 --> 22:41.030
IF YOU AND DEREK ARE
IN A PLANE CRASH AND YOU DIE,

22:41.030 --> 22:43.032
THE KID IS MINE?
YES.

22:43.032 --> 22:45.034
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
I KINDA HOPE,

22:45.034 --> 22:47.637
UH, YOU AND DEREK DIE,
JUST A LITTLE BIT,

22:47.637 --> 22:50.369
SO I CAN RAISE THE KID
WITH DECENT PRIORITIES.
I HAVE PRIORITIES.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.541
OH?

22:51.541 --> 22:52.702
SURGERY.

22:52.702 --> 22:54.103
OH, OKAY, THEN.
(laughs)

22:54.103 --> 22:56.105
YOU CAN RAISE
A GOOD LITTLE SURGEON.

22:56.105 --> 22:58.107
I TAKE IT BACK.
(door opens)

22:58.107 --> 23:00.950
HEY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
UH, WALKING.

23:00.950 --> 23:03.413
WE'RE IN LOCKDOWN.
YEAH, WE'RE NOT
WALKING OUTSIDE.

23:03.413 --> 23:05.815
THAT'S NOT WHAT LOCKDOWN MEANS.
IT MEANS STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

23:05.815 --> 23:08.418
DID YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT IT--
NO, I THOUGHT IT MEANT--

23:08.418 --> 23:10.790
STAY HERE. GET IN HERE.
WHAT? WHY ARE WE--

23:10.790 --> 23:12.792
THERE'S A SHOOTER LOOSE
IN THE HOSPITAL.
WHAT?

23:12.792 --> 23:14.964
STAY HERE. DON'T MOVE.
I'LL COME BACK AND GET YOU

23:14.964 --> 23:16.566
WHEN IT'S CLEAR.

23:16.566 --> 23:18.668
JUST STAY HERE. DON'T MOVE.

23:20.129 --> 23:22.932
OKAY, YOUR PULSE
IS COMING DOWN.

23:22.932 --> 23:26.075
WE HAVE TO CHECK
YOUR BLOOD COUNTS,

23:26.075 --> 23:28.407
BUT I THINK
YOU'LL BE GOOD TO GO

23:28.407 --> 23:30.810
FOR SURGERY TOMORROW.

23:32.081 --> 23:34.914
THAT'S THE FIFTH TIME
YOU'VE CHECKED YOUR PAGER.

23:34.914 --> 23:37.416
UH, JUST--IT'S HABIT.

23:37.416 --> 23:40.419
DR. B...
MY HUSBAND'S LATE.

23:40.419 --> 23:43.823
HE'S NEVER LATE, AND YOU'RE
HANGING OUT WITH ME.

23:43.823 --> 23:46.796
YOU DON'T REALLY STRIKE ME
AS THE HANGING-OUT TYPE.

23:46.796 --> 23:49.058
WHAT'S GOING ON?

23:49.058 --> 23:51.901
OKAY, TH-THERE IS
A-A SITUATION.

23:51.901 --> 23:54.664
I'M NOT EXACTLY SURE
WHAT IT IS.

23:54.664 --> 23:58.508
BUT, UM,
HOSPITAL PROCEDURE DICTATES

23:58.508 --> 24:00.740
THAT WHEN WE'RE ON A--
HE'S ON THE FLOOR.

24:00.740 --> 24:02.672
WHO?
THE SHOOTER.

24:02.672 --> 24:05.114
A SHOOT--THERE'S A SHOOTER
IN THE HOSPITAL?

24:05.114 --> 24:07.216
OH, MY GOD.

24:07.216 --> 24:09.579
(people screaming indistinctly)
(man) SIR, IT'S ALL RIGHT,

24:09.579 --> 24:12.922

SHH. JUST DO NOT MOVE.

24:25.735 --> 24:29.669

OKAY. OKAY.

YOU'RE DOING GREAT, ALEX.

NOW I NEED TO PUT IN A CHEST

27:28.417 --> 27:30.419

27:30.419 --> 27:32.221
I'M OKAY.

27:32.221 --> 27:34.954

I'M SORRY.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.232
I'M SORRY. SHH.

28:23.232 --> 28:25.234
THE BAD NEWS IS,
LESS PRIVACY.

28:25.234 --> 28:27.837
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS, IS THAT
YOUR BUNNY CAN MAKE FRIENDS

28:27.837 --> 28:30.179
WITH A VERY ATTRACTIVE BEAR
FROM DOWN THE HALL.
(girl) COOL.

28:30.179 --> 28:32.181
HEY, WATCH IT.
OH, SORRY, SORRY.

28:32.181 --> 28:34.884
(sighs)
I THOUGHT
WE WERE GONNA BE FRIENDS.

28:34.884 --> 28:37.787
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS NOW?
WE'RE ON LOCKDOWN, MOVING KIDS,

28:37.787 --> 28:40.890
GOD KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING,
AND YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT THIS?

28:40.890 --> 28:43.152
WELL, WE'RE STUCK HERE
AND WE HAVE TO BE TOGETHER,

28:43.152 --> 28:45.755
SO, YEAH, I WANT

OKAY, FINE.
I TRIED BEING FRIENDS.

28:45.755 --> 28:48.227
RISING ABOVE--I TRIED THAT,

28:48.227 --> 28:50.459
I'M GONNA GO
THE MORE TRADITIONAL ROUTE

28:50.459 --> 28:52.231
OF TOTALLY HATING YOUR GUTS.
(scoffs)

28:52.231 --> 28:55.464
OKAY, CHRISTOPHER, TYLER.

28:55.464 --> 28:58.968
TYLER, CHRISTOPHER.
YOU BOTH HATE CHICKEN. DISCUSS.
YES, I'M A VEGAN, TOO.

28:58.968 --> 29:01.170
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

29:01.170 --> 29:03.312
I DON'T DESERVE THIS, OKAY?

29:03.312 --> 29:05.775
I HAVE TREATED YOU WITH NOTHING
BUT RESPECT AND LOVE--
OH, NO.
SEE, THAT'S THE THING.

29:05.775 --> 29:08.848
YOU THINK YOU HAVE,
BUT YOU HAVEN'T.
I'M SURE THAT IT FEELS GREAT
TO ACT LIKE I'M THE BAD GUY,

29:08.848 --> 29:11.320
BUT THAT'S THE BIGGEST LOAD OF
YOU KNOW WHAT I'VE EVER HEARD.
I HAVE SPENT THE LAST MONTH

29:11.320 --> 29:14.353
TRYING TO CONVINCE MYSELF THAT
I DON'T NEED KIDS TO BE HAPPY--

29:14.353 --> 29:16.355
REALLY TRYING--
GIVING LECTURES TO MYSELF,

29:16.355 --> 29:18.357
SAYING IT OUT LOUD TO YOU
AND TO MARK

29:18.357 --> 29:21.060
AND TURNING MYSELF INSIDE OUT
TO WANT WHAT YOU WANTED.

29:21.060 --> 29:23.432
AND THEN I STOPPED FOR A SECOND,
AND I THOUGHT,

29:23.432 --> 29:25.334
DID YOU EVER TRY
TO IMAGINE WHAT IT WOULD

29:25.334 --> 29:27.867
BE LIKE TO CHANGE FOR ME?
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU DID.

29:27.867 --> 29:29.869
WHAT YOU DID WAS YOU DISMISSED
MY DREAM--MY DREAM--

29:29.869 --> 29:32.301
WHICH SAYS TO ME THAT YOU DON'T
GIVE A RAT'S ASS IF I'M HAPPY.

29:32.301 --> 29:34.944
I NEVER UNDERSTOOD SQUAT
ABOUT WHO YOU ARE.

29:34.944 --> 29:37.076
A NOW I DO,
AND I DON'T LIKE IT.
OH, REALLY, REALLY, REALLY?

29:37.076 --> 29:40.279
I'M SUPPOSED TO CHANGE FOR YOU?
WHY, BECAUSE WE'RE IN LOVE?

29:40.279 --> 29:43.012
I MEAN, BECAUSE YOU FALL IN LOVE
ALL THE TIME--MEN, WOMEN--

29:43.012 --> 29:46.415
EXCUSE ME. DR. ROBBINS.
I DON'T FEEL GOOD.

29:46.415 --> 29:49.388
(Mary) OH, MY--OH, MY--
(grunts) HE SHOT ME.

29:49.388 --> 29:53.162
HE SHOT ME. I'M SHOT.
YOU ARE GOING TO BE OKAY.

29:53.162 --> 29:56.465
MARY, OVER THERE IS S-SOME
GAUZE AND SOME SURGICAL PADS.

29:56.465 --> 29:59.899
CAN YOU GET THEM FOR ME?
NOPE. I-I GOTTA GO.
I GOTTA GO HOME. I--

29:59.899 --> 30:02.071
WE SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
MY HUSBAND--

30:02.071 --> 30:03.973
I HAVE TO FIND MY HUSBAND.

30:03.973 --> 30:06.375
AND THAT MAN, HE COULD
COME BACK IN HERE--
MARY. MARY.

30:06.375 --> 30:09.278
YOU'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. OKAY?
THAT MAN IS NOT COMING BACK.

30:09.278 --> 30:12.341
I NEED YOU
TO PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER,

30:12.341 --> 30:15.114
BRING ME THOSE SUPPLIES.
OKAY?
(gasping and groaning)

30:15.114 --> 30:18.017
I WAS DOING CHARTS,
AND NOW I'M SHOT?

30:18.017 --> 30:21.891
OKAY, OKAY. YOU'RE JUST FINE.
YOU'RE JUST FINE.
AH.

30:21.891 --> 30:23.953
THANK YOU.
OKAY. GOOD. VERY GOOD.

30:23.953 --> 30:26.155
(whimpers)
OH, OKAY.

30:26.155 --> 30:28.357
ALL RIGHT, MARY...

30:28.357 --> 30:31.560
(sobs)
UH, GO OVER TO THE WINDOW,
ALL RIGHT?

30:31.560 --> 30:34.033
AND LOOK AND SEE IF THERE'S
ANYBODY OUT THERE

30:34.033 --> 30:36.866
THAT CAN HELP US.
(panting)

30:36.866 --> 30:39.508
MARY, COME ON, COME ON,
COME ON. GO TO THE WINDOW NOW.
AH!

30:39.508 --> 30:43.112
AND JUST SEE IF SOMEBODY
CAN HELP US. GO ON. GO ON.

30:43.112 --> 30:44.843
OKAY.
(cries)

30:44.843 --> 30:46.845
(Charles) AAH!

30:46.845 --> 30:49.848
UM, THERE'S...

30:49.848 --> 30:52.151
THERE'S A...
AAH!

30:52.151 --> 30:54.483
A DEAD SECURITY GUARD.

30:54.483 --> 30:57.086
HE'S DEAD.

30:57.086 --> 30:59.558
AND THERE'S NO ONE ELSE
TO HELP US.

30:59.558 --> 31:01.630
THERE'S NO ONE ELSE.

31:01.630 --> 31:03.162
(gasps)

31:03.162 --> 31:05.494
(groans)
IT'S ALL RIGHT.
IT'S ALL RIGHT.

31:05.494 --> 31:07.496
UH, UH...

31:07.496 --> 31:11.500
THAT'S FINE. THAT'S...

31:11.500 --> 31:15.474
WHERE--WHERE IS THAT
WATER COMING FROM?

31:15.474 --> 31:18.177
DR. BAILEY,
YOU'RE CRYING.

31:18.177 --> 31:21.250
(grunting and groaning)
YOU'RE CRYING.

31:21.250 --> 31:23.252
OH.
(mutters and sighs)

31:23.252 --> 31:25.054
THEN, UH, M-MARY...

31:25.054 --> 31:28.017
YOU NEED TO C-COME OVER HERE
AND WIPE MY FACE

31:28.017 --> 31:30.089
SO THAT
I CAN KEEP WORKING.

31:30.089 --> 31:32.992
(gasping)
OH, OKAY, OKAY.

31:32.992 --> 31:34.193
OKAY.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.594
(grunts and groans)

31:35.594 --> 31:37.066
OKAY.

31:37.066 --> 31:40.099
WE'RE ALL GONNA BE FINE.

31:40.099 --> 31:42.001
(breathes heavily)

31:42.001 --> 31:44.133
(Teddy) OKAY,
HE'S READY FOR TRANSPORT.

31:44.133 --> 31:46.275
OKAY, JACKSON,
GET HIM UP TO I.C.U.

31:46.275 --> 31:48.507
START WARMING HIM UP
AND DRAW AN A.B.G.--
I CAN'T, SIR.

31:48.507 --> 31:51.010
EXCUSE ME?
WE CAN'T LEAVE HERE.

31:51.010 --> 31:53.612
THAT'S WHAT SHEPHERD TOLD ME.
THERE'S A SHOOTER

31:53.612 --> 31:55.985
IN THE HOSPITAL.
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO STAY HERE--
THERE'S A WHAT?

31:55.985 --> 31:58.948
SHEPHERD SAID THAT WE'RE--
THIS PATIENT IS HYPOTHERMIC.
I NEED TO GET HIM TO AN I.C.U.,

31:58.948 --> 32:01.590
START WARMING HIM UP BEFORE
HE STARTS TO CIRCLE THE DRAIN.
WELL, SHEPHERD SAID--

32:01.590 --> 32:04.653
YOU DIDN'T BOTHER
TO MENTION THIS UNTIL NOW?
SHEPHERD SAID--

32:04.653 --> 32:07.997
YOU DIDN'T BOTHER
TO TELL ME THIS UNTIL N--
WELL, SHEPHERD SAID--

32:07.997 --> 32:10.459
YOU ALREADY TOLD ME
WHAT SHEPHERD SAID.

32:10.459 --> 32:12.031
OKAY.

32:12.031 --> 32:13.562
I'LL TAKE HIM UP MYSELF.

32:13.562 --> 32:17.066
EVERYONE ELSE, STAY HERE.
I'M COMING.

32:17.066 --> 32:19.668
NO, NO, YOU STAY PUT.
I'M A CARDIOTHORACIC SURGEON.

32:19.668 --> 32:21.670
HE HAS A PENETRATING INJURY
TO HIS CHEST.

32:21.670 --> 32:25.344
YOU DON'T GET A VOTE THIS TIME.
I'M COMING. LET'S GO.

32:25.344 --> 32:27.116
OKAY.

32:28.547 --> 32:31.020
(screaming)
HER BLOOD PRESSURE'S
90 OVER 60 AND DROPPING.

32:31.020 --> 32:33.282
LET'S HANG SOME MORE FLUIDS.
I HAVE
THE PORTABLE ULTRASOUND.

32:33.282 --> 32:35.284
ALL RIGHT, CHECK HER APPENDIX.
I WILL BE RIGHT BACK.

32:35.284 --> 32:37.286
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA FORGIVE ME

32:37.286 --> 32:39.328
FOR NOT BEING A GOOD ENOUGH
LESBIAN FOR YOU?

32:39.328 --> 32:41.330
WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING
TO CONVINCE ME THAT

32:41.330 --> 32:43.993
YOU'RE FALLING IN LOVE WITH ME
AND NOT WITH BEING IN LOVE.

32:43.993 --> 32:45.995
WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING TO
CONVINCE ME THAT I'M DIFFERENT

32:45.995 --> 32:48.037
THAN GEORGE O'MALLEY,
ERICA HAHN, MARK SLOAN

32:48.037 --> 32:49.738
OR THE GIRL

32:49.738 --> 32:53.202
I MEAN, YOU HAVE A HUGE HEART,
AND I LOVE THAT ABOUT YOU.

32:53.202 --> 32:55.204
BUT I DON'T TRUST YOU.
WHY WOULD I?

32:55.204 --> 32:57.546
DR. ROBBINS...

32:57.546 --> 33:00.009

AFTER YOU STINK UP THIS PLACE
WITH YOUR VOMIT.

33:21.070 --> 33:22.431
(exhales deeply)

33:26.735 --> 33:29.338
OH, MY GOD. OH, MY GOD.

33:29.338 --> 33:31.580
(whispering) OH, MY GOD.
MEREDITH, GET DOWN.
(whispering) WHAT? WHAT?

33:31.580 --> 33:33.582
SHH. SHH.

33:37.616 --> 33:39.548

33:46.695 --> 33:48.657

33:48.657 --> 33:51.660
(whispering)
WHAT DO YOU MEAN? WHAT--
IT'S THE GUY
FROM THE ELEVATOR.

33:51.660 --> 33:53.662
HE ASKED ME FOR DIRECTIONS,

33:53.662 --> 33:55.664
HOW TO GET
TO THE CHIEF'S OFFICE.

33:55.664 --> 33:58.036
I-I DON'T--I DON'T--

33:58.036 --> 34:00.038
(lowered voice) MEREDITH,
THE GUY WITH THE GUN

34:00.038 --> 34:02.571
IS LOOKING FOR DEREK.

34:02.571 --> 34:04.443
(vomits)

34:11.550 --> 34:14.453
(sirens wailing)

34:14.453 --> 34:16.785
DR. SHEPHERD.

34:16.785 --> 34:19.688
SIR, YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE.
IT'S NOT SAFE.

34:19.688 --> 34:21.690
I KNOW IT'S NOT SAFE HERE.

34:21.690 --> 34:23.362
THAT'S THE POINT.

34:23.362 --> 34:26.165
THIS HOSPITAL ISN'T SAFE.

34:26.165 --> 34:29.268
YOU DON'T RECOGNIZE ME,
DO YOU?

34:30.699 --> 34:33.802
MR. CLARK.

34:33.802 --> 34:36.205

YOU SHOULD GO SOMEPLACE SAFE
SO YOU DON'T GET HURT.
I'M ALREADY HURT.

34:42.411 --> 34:47.316
YOU HURT ME WHEN YOU DECIDED
TO KILL MY WIFE.

34:49.758 --> 34:51.490

34:51.490 --> 34:54.523
B.P.'s 60 PALP.
HE'S LOSING A LOT OF BLOOD.

34:54.523 --> 34:56.665
HE NEEDS A TRANSFUSION.

34:56.665 --> 34:59.128

35:32.861 --> 35:35.704
(door opens and closes)

35:35.704 --> 35:37.836
HEY, SLOAN.

35:37.836 --> 35:40.309

(chuckles)

35:40.309 --> 35:42.311
I'M DOING MY BEST.

35:42.311 --> 35:44.513

35:58.287 --> 36:01.560
YOU'RE NOT THE MAN HERE.
I'M THE MAN.

36:01.560 --> 36:03.732

36:03.732 --> 36:06.665
(breathing heavily)

36:06.665 --> 36:09.698
I TOLD MY WIFE

36:16.705 --> 36:20.879
I LET YOU DECIDE

36:20.879 --> 36:23.252
I WASN'T A MAN THEN.

36:23.252 --> 36:27.356
BUT I'M A MAN NOW.

36:27.356 --> 36:28.757

36:28.757 --> 36:31.360

36:59.488 --> 37:01.650
DON'T TELL ME THAT LIE
WE TELL EVERYBODY--

37:01.650 --> 37:04.493
"YOU'RE FINE.

OKAY. OKAY.

37:33.852 --> 37:35.524

37:35.524 --> 37:38.387
WHAT KIND OF HOSPITAL
IS THIS?

37:38.387 --> 37:41.660
IT ISN'T SAFE HERE.

37:41.660 --> 37:44.393
SOMEBODY
HAS TO PROTECT PEOPLE...

37:44.393 --> 37:46.295
FROM YOU...

37:46.295 --> 37:49.798
HANDING DOWN JUDGMENTS

37:59.648 --> 38:02.851
MR. CLARK,

38:06.615 --> 38:08.857
I KNOW YOUR LOSS.

38:08.857 --> 38:10.989
I LOST MY FATHER...

38:10.989 --> 38:13.792
WHEN I WAS A KID.

38:13.792 --> 38:16.395
TWO GUYS KILLED MY FATHER
FOR HIS WATCH

38:16.395 --> 38:19.728
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME...

38:19.728 --> 38:22.331
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

38:23.802 --> 38:27.576
I DIDN'T BECOME A DOCTOR
BECAUSE I WANTED TO BE GOD.

38:27.576 --> 38:30.879
I BECAME A DOCTOR
BECAUSE I WANTED TO SAVE LIVES.

38:32.941 --> 38:37.386
LOOK AT ME.

38:37.386 --> 38:39.087
PLEASE.

38:39.087 --> 38:41.690
LOOK AT ME IN THE EYE.

38:43.352 --> 38:47.596
I'M A HUMAN BEING.

38:47.596 --> 38:49.798
I MAKE MISTAKES.

38:49.798 --> 38:52.861
I'M FLAWED.

38:52.861 --> 38:54.733
WE ALL ARE.

38:56.334 --> 38:58.707
TODAY I THINK...
