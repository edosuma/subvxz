- <i>Previously on</i> Gotham...
- BRUCE: Who are you?

00:04.537 --> 00:07.438
- Oh, my word.
- Please don't hurt me.

00:07.473 --> 00:09.173
- We caught a spy.
- Ivy?

00:09.208 --> 00:09.974
No!

00:10.977 --> 00:11.642
Watch out!

00:12.679 --> 00:13.477
(screams)

00:14.030 --> 00:16.297
- Ivy?
- (crying)

00:16.332 --> 00:17.999
OSWALD: <i>Gotham listens to me.</i>

00:18.034 --> 00:20.501
<i>It's time to round up our friends.</i>

00:20.537 --> 00:22.303
(shouting)

00:22.338 --> 00:24.038
VALERIE: <i>Former war hero.</i>

00:24.073 --> 00:26.340
<i>Former white knight
cop. Now bounty hunter.</i>

00:26.376 --> 00:28.576
GORDON: <i>Saving Gotham's
not my job anymore.</i>

00:28.611 --> 00:30.812
BULLOCK: <i>You are a cop
in everything but name.</i>

00:30.847 --> 00:33.815
Who the hell are you, Jim Gordon?

00:33.850 --> 00:35.750
- Wait...
- Shut up for once.

00:42.525 --> 00:44.492
(drumroll)

00:45.862 --> 00:47.562
- (clucking)
- (laughter)

00:47.597 --> 00:50.064
(barking)

00:50.099 --> 00:52.033
(imitating animals)

00:52.068 --> 00:54.368
(chuckles)

00:54.404 --> 00:56.003
When I count to three,

00:56.039 --> 00:58.506
you will all awake and have no memory

00:58.541 --> 01:00.903
of your animal identity.

01:01.878 --> 01:03.811
One, two,

01:03.847 --> 01:04.846
three.

01:05.748 --> 01:09.016
(laughter, cheering)

01:09.052 --> 01:10.518
Thank you. Thank you.

01:10.553 --> 01:12.854
A magician? Really?

01:12.889 --> 01:15.256
Hypnotist. I like him.

01:15.291 --> 01:16.924
Plus, the place is packed. Be happy.

01:16.960 --> 01:18.285
JERVIS: Just a taste,

01:18.336 --> 01:19.594
ladies and gentlemen.

01:19.629 --> 01:24.131
But now let us venture
into something more...

01:24.167 --> 01:25.566
arcane.

01:25.602 --> 01:28.035
I'll need a single volunteer.

01:28.071 --> 01:29.670
(audience murmuring)

01:31.274 --> 01:33.307
Hmm.

01:37.247 --> 01:38.480
You, sir.

01:39.694 --> 01:41.761
Beautiful suit.

01:41.796 --> 01:43.429
- Thank you.
- Lawyer?

01:43.464 --> 01:45.264
- Uh, doctor.
- Oh.

01:45.299 --> 01:46.399
Your mistress?

01:46.434 --> 01:48.367
- My-my wife.
- Oh, delightful.

01:48.403 --> 01:50.703
- (laughter)
- (watch ticking)

01:52.740 --> 01:54.540
Listen to the watch.

01:54.575 --> 01:56.142
The way it's ticking

01:56.822 --> 01:58.911
synchronizes with your heartbeat.

01:58.946 --> 02:01.580
(heart beating, watch ticking)

02:02.317 --> 02:05.051
Look into my eyes.

02:05.086 --> 02:07.253
Not above them, not around them,

02:07.288 --> 02:10.222
(echoing): but deep into their center.

02:10.258 --> 02:12.058
(heartbeat and ticking slow)

02:12.093 --> 02:15.806
You are completely relaxed
and are becoming weightless.

02:17.598 --> 02:20.299
Are you ready to do
something impossible?

02:20.334 --> 02:21.634
Yes.

02:27.442 --> 02:29.341
Stand upon the chair.

02:29.377 --> 02:31.343
(audience chuckles, murmurs)

02:32.680 --> 02:34.480
No.

02:34.515 --> 02:35.548
The back of it.

02:35.583 --> 02:38.651
Remember, you weigh nothing at all.

02:38.686 --> 02:40.119
(audience gasping)

02:40.154 --> 02:43.122
- He'll fall.
- Not at all, my dear.

02:44.559 --> 02:45.658
(audience gasping)

02:48.362 --> 02:52.331
In a hypnotic state,
unburdened by doubt and fear,

02:52.366 --> 02:54.667
we can accomplish the impossible.

02:54.702 --> 02:57.002
Now...

02:57.038 --> 02:58.716
one foot.

03:01.209 --> 03:03.109
(audience gasping)

03:03.144 --> 03:05.778
So you could get him to
do anything you wanted?

03:05.813 --> 03:08.074
Did you have something
in mind, Miss Kean?

03:10.351 --> 03:11.989
Jump down, sir.

03:14.655 --> 03:16.622
(audience cheering)

03:16.691 --> 03:18.023
(quietly): Lock sense away.

03:18.059 --> 03:19.692
Awaken the rascal.

03:19.727 --> 03:22.967
When I say it is so,
your home is my castle.

03:23.005 --> 03:24.563
Now, I'm going to count down

03:24.599 --> 03:26.198
and clap my hands and you will awake.

03:26.234 --> 03:28.134
Three, two, one.

03:29.884 --> 03:31.704
How do you feel, sir?

03:31.739 --> 03:33.139
I feel great.

03:33.174 --> 03:34.273
(chuckles)

03:34.308 --> 03:35.741
- Thank you!
- (applause)

03:36.677 --> 03:38.377
Thank you. (chuckles)

03:40.738 --> 03:43.515
Very impressive, Mr. Tetch.

03:43.579 --> 03:45.284
You have quite the gift.

03:45.319 --> 03:47.022
But you didn't answer my question.

03:47.035 --> 03:50.589
Can you make people do
anything you tell them to do?

03:51.826 --> 03:54.260
Only things they secretly wish to do.

03:54.295 --> 03:57.196
It's surprising what people wish for,

03:57.231 --> 03:59.565
secretly, deep down.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.033
- Mm.
- True.

04:01.068 --> 04:03.169
You must be a very popular man.

04:03.204 --> 04:04.737
Oh, I wish.

04:04.772 --> 04:07.573
Parties like this help
pay my way, so thank you.

04:07.608 --> 04:09.241
And you're new to Gotham?

04:09.277 --> 04:11.110
Yes. Just arrived from up north.

04:11.145 --> 04:12.411
You have a place to stay?

04:12.446 --> 04:13.767
Not yet.

04:14.549 --> 04:17.507
But something always seems to turn up.

04:32.500 --> 04:34.600
This is weird for me, too.

04:34.635 --> 04:36.468
What's-what's your name?

04:36.504 --> 04:37.703
Five.

04:37.738 --> 04:41.140
Well, 514A, but they call me Five.

04:41.175 --> 04:43.409
- At Indian Hill?
- Yes.

04:43.444 --> 04:45.044
And how 'bout before that?

04:45.079 --> 04:47.780
I-I don't remember... I don't
remember anything before that.

04:47.815 --> 04:49.081
That's convenient, isn't it?

04:49.116 --> 04:50.149
I mean, nothing?

04:50.184 --> 04:51.917
I mean, you must have had a home,

04:51.953 --> 04:53.552
family, friends,

04:53.588 --> 04:55.154
parents.

04:55.189 --> 04:56.455
If I did, I can't remember.

04:56.490 --> 04:58.891
I woke up in that lab over a year ago.

04:58.926 --> 05:01.393
I was locked up the
whole time I was there.

05:01.429 --> 05:05.731
They gave me books, did tests on me.

05:05.766 --> 05:07.132
Many tests.

05:07.168 --> 05:09.301
I heard the other inmates in the halls,

05:09.337 --> 05:11.503
but I never saw them.

05:11.539 --> 05:13.606
Not until Ms. Mooney broke us out.

05:13.641 --> 05:16.275
I'm sorry I surprised
you by coming here.

05:16.310 --> 05:18.117
When-when I saw you...

05:19.013 --> 05:20.312
I had to meet you.

05:22.350 --> 05:23.916
You saw me?

05:25.686 --> 05:27.486
On the rooftop.

05:27.521 --> 05:28.921
With that girl.

05:28.956 --> 05:30.990
Selina. She gave me money.

05:31.025 --> 05:32.591
I followed her.

05:32.627 --> 05:35.427
You're welcome to stay
here as long as you need.

05:35.463 --> 05:37.763
Perhaps we should contact
someone with more expertise

05:37.798 --> 05:39.765
in these matters, Master Bruce.

05:39.800 --> 05:41.934
It's late. That can wait until tomorrow.

05:41.969 --> 05:43.402
I'll make up one of the guest rooms.

05:48.476 --> 05:49.808
ALFRED: Master Bruce,

05:49.844 --> 05:51.977
we have to get rid of that
thing as quick as possible.

05:52.013 --> 05:53.979
He's a human being, Alfred.
He's in need of help.

05:54.015 --> 05:55.814
Look, I-I understand

05:55.850 --> 05:58.550
you feel sorry for the boy, but have
a butcher's at him, will you, huh?

05:58.586 --> 06:00.686
I mean, he's you. Hugo
Strange made another you.

06:00.721 --> 06:01.921
I reckon it's got something to do

06:01.956 --> 06:03.155
with that secret society or something.

06:03.190 --> 06:04.990
So what do we do?

06:05.026 --> 06:07.126
Throw him back on the
street? I-I want to know

06:07.161 --> 06:09.228
who and what and why as
much as you do, Alfred.

06:09.263 --> 06:11.196
Better he stays here until we find out.

06:11.232 --> 06:12.431
Fine, but tomorrow we call Lucius Fox.

06:12.466 --> 06:14.646
Maybe he'll know what to
do with it. I mean, him.

06:22.143 --> 06:23.108
(flame sizzles)

06:36.742 --> 06:38.991
- Valerie.
- James.

06:39.026 --> 06:40.592
You want some breakfast?

06:40.628 --> 06:42.594
There's a place around the corner.

06:42.630 --> 06:44.096
Pass.

06:44.131 --> 06:45.898
I have to be at City Hall in an hour.

06:45.933 --> 06:46.932
I have to go home and shower.

06:46.968 --> 06:48.367
I have a shower.

06:48.402 --> 06:50.369
No, you have a dark hole in the wall

06:50.438 --> 06:52.538
with no water pressure
and one damp towel.

06:52.573 --> 06:54.373
Right.

06:56.727 --> 07:00.179
Well, I'm collecting my bounty
from the GCPD today, so, uh,

07:00.214 --> 07:02.681
I can stop on my way home, make things

07:02.717 --> 07:05.384
a little... nicer.

07:06.298 --> 07:07.753
Yeah, good luck with that.

07:16.497 --> 07:18.197
That was fun.

07:18.232 --> 07:20.432
See you around.

07:22.220 --> 07:23.902
Okay. See ya.

07:23.938 --> 07:26.638
BARNES: <i>I'm not gonna
get all misty-eyed,</i>

07:26.674 --> 07:30.809
but the simple truth is this
department has missed you.

07:30.845 --> 07:34.279
God-given talent like
yours is hard to find.

07:34.315 --> 07:37.282
Your expertise and your
professionalism is exemplary.

07:37.318 --> 07:40.319
I'm very pleased that you're
returning to the GCPD.

07:40.354 --> 07:42.988
Where else can you make a
difference like this? Nowhere.

07:43.024 --> 07:45.924
- I know. It's not that...
- Look...

07:45.960 --> 07:47.760
(grunts) now,

07:47.795 --> 07:49.895
forgive me if I'm, uh,

07:49.930 --> 07:52.698
stepping into a delicate minefield,

07:52.733 --> 07:54.867
but if what you're worried
about is Jim Gordon,

07:54.902 --> 07:57.102
he no longer works here.

07:57.138 --> 08:00.239
No GCPD affiliation whatsoever.

08:00.274 --> 08:02.241
(indistinct chatter)

08:04.211 --> 08:05.544
Hey, Harvey.

08:06.614 --> 08:07.980
Jim!

08:08.015 --> 08:10.249
Buddy. Pal. Ha-ha.

08:10.284 --> 08:11.583
Let's get a cup of coffee.

08:11.619 --> 08:13.185
I just came by for my check.

08:13.220 --> 08:16.722
City still owes me for bringing
in the last of Strange's creeps.

08:16.757 --> 08:18.624
- Yeah, you been hustlin'...
- THOMPKINS: Jim?

08:29.837 --> 08:33.205
Hello, Jim. What-what are you...

08:34.275 --> 08:36.508
Hey. You look well.

08:36.544 --> 08:37.799
Thanks.

08:39.179 --> 08:40.979
You visiting?

08:41.015 --> 08:43.749
No, we're... um, I'm-I'm moving here.

08:43.784 --> 08:46.351
Permanently.

08:47.388 --> 08:49.154
With my fiancé.

08:53.594 --> 08:57.262
He's been offered head trauma
position at Gotham General.

08:57.298 --> 08:59.264
A doctor. Good call.

09:01.168 --> 09:04.002
Captain Barnes has been
nice enough to offer me

09:04.038 --> 09:06.004
my old job back. Here. Um...

09:06.040 --> 09:07.573
I haven't decided yet.

09:07.641 --> 09:10.375
Well, if you did, you'd see me.

09:10.411 --> 09:12.911
I'm here now and again getting paid.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.844
It's good to see you, Lee.

09:20.688 --> 09:23.659
I guess I better get going.
The movers are due any minute.

09:24.558 --> 09:26.892
Be well, Jim.

09:31.799 --> 09:33.832
Jim.

09:35.611 --> 09:38.137
Where's my money, Harvey?

09:39.173 --> 09:41.507

09:41.542 --> 09:43.509

JERVIS: Who am I?

11:13.953 --> 11:16.119
I haunt your dreams like a ghost,

11:16.155 --> 11:18.021

11:19.191 --> 11:21.758

11:21.794 --> 11:23.026
As fast as you can!

There's no escape from the magic man.

11:26.465 --> 11:28.365

11:32.571 --> 11:33.704
Jolly good.

11:33.739 --> 11:36.039
Now, get some plastic,

11:36.075 --> 11:38.041
wrap her up and bury her in the garden.

11:38.077 --> 11:40.978
Oh, and I'm gonna need
you to kill yourself, too.

11:41.013 --> 11:42.479
Chop-chop.

11:51.890 --> 11:53.890

My sweet sister.

Alice.

I've traveled so far.

12:04.570 --> 12:07.537

12:20.853 --> 12:22.953
(lock clicking)

12:25.424 --> 12:29.226
This time, no excuses.
My money... where is it?

12:29.261 --> 12:31.361
I'll get it for you.

12:31.397 --> 12:32.663
You said that last week,

12:32.698 --> 12:34.464
the week before that.

12:34.500 --> 12:37.467
I should have known you're a liar.

12:37.503 --> 12:39.102
- A cheat!
- I lost my job.

12:39.138 --> 12:42.739
Then get another! Don't cheat me!

12:46.178 --> 12:49.279
But, uh, perhaps...

12:49.315 --> 12:51.915
we work something out, eh?

12:51.950 --> 12:53.283
If you're a nice girl?

12:53.319 --> 12:55.719
Are you a nice girl?

12:55.754 --> 12:57.120
Stay away from me.

12:57.156 --> 12:59.723
- Oh, be nice to me.
- Stop, you don't understand.

12:59.758 --> 13:00.791
(cackles) Be nice...

13:00.826 --> 13:02.659
Oh!

13:02.695 --> 13:03.694
(grunts)

13:06.065 --> 13:07.764
(growls)

13:11.704 --> 13:13.136
(grunting)

13:13.172 --> 13:15.605
- I'm so sorry.
- (gurgling)

13:15.641 --> 13:16.973
You shouldn't have done that.

13:17.009 --> 13:18.975
You brought this on yourself.

13:19.011 --> 13:20.143
(screams)

13:20.179 --> 13:22.346
JAMES: <i>Since the death</i>

13:22.381 --> 13:24.348
of Galavan, the office of mayor

13:24.383 --> 13:26.316
has been governed by
the elected officials

13:26.352 --> 13:28.151
you see behind me.

13:28.187 --> 13:31.355
This city desperately needs experienced,

13:31.390 --> 13:32.656
seasoned leadership.

13:32.691 --> 13:34.157
And so, in their wisdom,

13:34.193 --> 13:35.692
they have persuaded me...

13:35.728 --> 13:37.394
Much against my will...

13:37.429 --> 13:39.463
To resume the office of mayor

13:39.498 --> 13:41.031
until elections can be organized

13:41.066 --> 13:42.866
in the new year.

13:42.901 --> 13:44.534
Stop!

13:47.573 --> 13:51.074
This proceeding is a sham.

13:51.110 --> 13:53.143
- Security, remove this criminal!
- Criminal?

13:53.178 --> 13:56.680
I was jailed illegally
by a corrupt system.

13:56.715 --> 14:00.617
A corrupt system that was
put into place by this man,

14:00.652 --> 14:02.986
who has the audacity

14:03.021 --> 14:05.922
to put himself back into
the position that he brought

14:05.958 --> 14:07.724
so much shame and dishonor to.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.192
How dare you?

14:09.228 --> 14:10.927
No, how dare you

14:10.963 --> 14:13.864
waltz up there and
announce yourself mayor?

14:13.899 --> 14:18.402
The people demand to have a say
into who will represent them,

14:18.437 --> 14:20.737
- who will protect them.
- Yeah! Yeah!

14:20.773 --> 14:23.673
- CROWD: Yeah!
- It was I...

14:23.709 --> 14:27.411
I alone... who drove out the
monsters that plagued our city.

14:27.446 --> 14:30.247
Oh, please. Where were you then,

14:30.282 --> 14:33.784
while I faced peril at the
hands of those abominations?

14:33.819 --> 14:37.254
Sir, are you challenging
James's appointment to office?

14:37.289 --> 14:39.189
I most certainly am.

14:39.224 --> 14:41.625
(crowd clamoring)

14:41.660 --> 14:43.293
You better get a close-up.

14:43.328 --> 14:44.628
(applause)

14:44.663 --> 14:46.096
(mic feedback)

14:46.131 --> 14:50.033
To govern this city, one
should be <i> legally</i> elected,

14:50.068 --> 14:52.469
which is why I, Oswald Cobblepot,

14:52.504 --> 14:55.472
announce my candidacy
for the office of mayor.

14:55.507 --> 14:56.807
- (crowd clamoring)
- And I demand,

14:56.842 --> 14:58.542
and the people demand,

14:58.577 --> 15:02.746
that an emergency election
be held forthwith!

15:02.781 --> 15:04.848
(cheering and applause)

15:07.052 --> 15:09.653
CROWD (chanting): Cobblepot!
Cobblepot! Cobblepot!

15:14.840 --> 15:17.340
- Good, good, good.
- (grunting and panting)

15:17.376 --> 15:19.509
One more time, one more time.

15:19.544 --> 15:21.544
- And again.
- (exhaling sharply)

15:24.646 --> 15:25.645
Good boy.

15:26.281 --> 15:28.416
One more time.

15:28.442 --> 15:29.592
Good morning.

15:29.643 --> 15:31.484
(exhales) Did you sleep well?

15:31.519 --> 15:32.485
BRUCE 2: Yes.

15:35.423 --> 15:36.689
Would you like to try?

15:36.725 --> 15:38.224
ALFRED: Uh, I don't think

15:38.259 --> 15:39.859
that's a particularly good
idea, do you Master Bruce?

15:39.894 --> 15:42.061
Come now, Alfred, I think a
little exercise before breakfast

15:42.097 --> 15:43.229
might be just what he needs.

15:43.264 --> 15:45.164
Fine.

15:45.200 --> 15:47.367
I'll go easy on you. Pop these on.

15:47.402 --> 15:49.502
Right hand in. And the other one.

15:49.537 --> 15:51.671
Like that. All right, step up.

15:51.706 --> 15:53.473
Now, just remember...

15:53.508 --> 15:56.576
Let's see what you got,
no, keep your gloves up.

15:56.611 --> 15:58.878
Protect the chin at
all times, all right?

15:58.913 --> 16:01.547
Ready? Here we go. Bosh.

16:01.583 --> 16:03.516
- Ready?
- (exhales sharply)

16:03.551 --> 16:04.751
Come on.

16:04.819 --> 16:06.552
(Alfred grunts)

16:06.588 --> 16:07.854
- BRUCE 2: Sorry. Sorry...
- No,

16:07.889 --> 16:09.555
ab-absolutely fine.

16:09.591 --> 16:11.791
Let's see if we can do that again.

16:11.826 --> 16:12.792
Here I come.

16:16.765 --> 16:18.407
(spits) Bloody hell.

16:20.201 --> 16:21.401
Who taught you how to do that then?

16:21.436 --> 16:22.984
No one.

16:22.996 --> 16:25.667
If they did, I... I don't remember.

16:27.425 --> 16:30.576
Right, well, let's see
what you got, sunshine.

16:30.612 --> 16:32.311
Here we go again. Here we go.

16:33.481 --> 16:35.081
(grunting)

16:35.116 --> 16:36.582
ALFRED: Oh.

16:36.618 --> 16:39.485
Oh, dear. I'm frightfully sorry.

16:39.521 --> 16:41.254
What for?

16:41.289 --> 16:43.322
- Your nose.
- ALFRED: Didn't you feel it?

16:45.760 --> 16:46.793
No.

16:46.828 --> 16:48.230
Should I?

16:49.631 --> 16:51.597
Right, well, I think that's, uh...

16:51.633 --> 16:54.667
quite enough for today,
don't you, Master Bruce?

16:54.702 --> 16:55.935
Here you are.

16:55.970 --> 16:57.470
Press that hard against your nose.

16:57.505 --> 17:00.339
All right? Here you go.

17:00.390 --> 17:01.823
Stem the flow.

17:01.858 --> 17:03.558
Good lad.

17:08.531 --> 17:10.998
Well, that's a very nasty scar.

17:12.023 --> 17:14.199
Where'd you get that?
Or can't you remember?

17:17.810 --> 17:19.574
What did they do to you in there?

17:23.646 --> 17:25.880
<i>(knocking on door)</i>

17:28.040 --> 17:30.918
Good day, Mr. Gordon.

17:30.918 --> 17:32.269
Tea?

17:32.322 --> 17:33.287
GORDON: <i>How'd you find me?</i>

17:33.323 --> 17:34.856
Oh, you're famous, sir.

17:34.891 --> 17:36.791
Your name's in the papers.

17:36.826 --> 17:38.659
The fearless bounty hunter.

17:45.101 --> 17:46.634
I want you to find my sister.

17:47.766 --> 17:49.270
We're very close.

17:49.305 --> 17:52.573
We lost our parents at an early age.

17:52.609 --> 17:54.775
I became her guardian.

17:54.811 --> 17:56.711
But her condition proved

17:56.746 --> 17:58.228
too much for me. I sought help.

17:58.267 --> 17:59.881
The worst kind.

17:59.916 --> 18:02.250
The fiend, Professor Strange.

18:02.285 --> 18:04.218
Her condition?

18:04.254 --> 18:06.487
Some poison in her blood.

18:06.522 --> 18:09.457
Very rare. Unique, in fact.

18:09.492 --> 18:10.825
He took her in.

18:10.860 --> 18:13.127
Said she needed constant supervision.

18:13.162 --> 18:15.062
He wouldn't let me see her.

18:15.098 --> 18:16.564
You go to the police?

18:16.599 --> 18:18.499
Useless.

18:18.534 --> 18:20.891
This is Gotham after all.

18:20.929 --> 18:24.105
The years passed and I lost hope.

18:24.140 --> 18:26.007
But then I heard about the breakout.

18:26.042 --> 18:28.175
I assumed she escaped with others.

18:28.211 --> 18:29.310
But now she is out there.

18:29.345 --> 18:30.378
Alone.

18:30.446 --> 18:31.412
Afraid.

18:31.447 --> 18:34.989
Indian Hill escapees get
five grand from the GCPD.

18:35.027 --> 18:36.497
You able to top that?

18:38.021 --> 18:39.253
I'll double it.

18:39.289 --> 18:41.429
I'll see what I can do.

18:42.125 --> 18:44.256
Thank you very much.

18:52.167 --> 18:54.390
Leave your number.

19:03.980 --> 19:06.213
You've seen so much pain and tragedy,

19:06.249 --> 19:07.848
Mr. Gordon.

19:07.884 --> 19:09.917
I hope it hasn't left you too alone.

19:13.156 --> 19:14.722
GILZEAN: <i>I'm not being negative.</i>

19:14.757 --> 19:17.425
I'm just saying, it's a big step.

19:17.460 --> 19:20.628
- Holy crap.
- (phones ringing)

19:20.663 --> 19:21.629
Headquarters, let me
just say one thing first.

19:21.664 --> 19:24.632
Gotham is rife with crime, Butch.

19:24.667 --> 19:26.500
Who better than a
criminal to clean it up?

19:26.536 --> 19:28.169
Okay. Look,

19:28.204 --> 19:30.404
you know I've faced the
worst Gotham has to offer,

19:30.440 --> 19:32.807
but politicians, they scare me.

19:32.842 --> 19:34.342
The people of Gotham are with me.

19:34.377 --> 19:36.177
They are scared, which means angry.

19:36.212 --> 19:38.212
And who have they got to turn to?

19:38.247 --> 19:40.047
Aubrey James? (scoffs)

19:40.083 --> 19:41.048
Please.

19:41.084 --> 19:43.384
That man is a hack.

19:43.419 --> 19:47.688
This is my opportunity
to create a legacy.

19:47.724 --> 19:50.424
One that my father would be proud of.

19:50.460 --> 19:52.426
- WOMAN: Mr. Cobblepot?
- Oh.

19:52.462 --> 19:54.261
What do you think?

19:57.100 --> 19:58.699
(sighs)

19:58.735 --> 19:59.967
You got my vote.

20:00.003 --> 20:01.702
(chuckles)

20:01.738 --> 20:03.871
Mr. Cobblepot, I have Aubrey James.

20:03.906 --> 20:05.773
He'd like to meet you, alone.

20:06.943 --> 20:08.709
Hmm.

20:28.564 --> 20:30.464
What are you looking for?

20:30.500 --> 20:33.034
The scars on your back are distinctive.

20:33.069 --> 20:34.468
I was hoping to find a reference,

20:34.504 --> 20:36.604
- a clue as to why they were made.
- (door opens)

20:36.639 --> 20:38.439
You need to hide.

20:38.474 --> 20:40.141
What?

20:42.678 --> 20:44.478
She won't understand.

20:45.915 --> 20:47.915
What are you doing?

20:47.950 --> 20:49.116
Homework.

20:52.688 --> 20:53.829
Is something wrong?

20:54.596 --> 20:56.524
(sighs)

20:57.794 --> 20:59.660
Ivy's missing.

21:02.165 --> 21:03.786
She'll turn up somewhere.

21:04.867 --> 21:06.133
Doesn't she always?

21:07.170 --> 21:09.470
This time, she fell.

21:09.505 --> 21:13.240
And it was a long way down into water.

21:13.276 --> 21:14.675
And maybe she survived.

21:14.710 --> 21:16.946
I got a bad feeling.

21:16.984 --> 21:20.247
No offense, but...

21:22.718 --> 21:24.952
it's not like you to care.

21:24.987 --> 21:27.955
She had nothing, that kid.

21:27.990 --> 21:29.957
I was it.

21:29.992 --> 21:32.827
No one else would even talk to her.

21:46.642 --> 21:47.942
(chuckles)

21:47.977 --> 21:49.477
I shouldn't give up, right?

21:50.339 --> 21:52.746
Maybe take one more
look at the shelters,

21:52.782 --> 21:54.381
our favorite hiding spots?

21:54.417 --> 21:56.383
Sure.

21:56.419 --> 21:57.985
Good idea.

21:58.020 --> 21:59.854
(sighs)

21:59.889 --> 22:01.856
Will you come with me?

22:03.426 --> 22:07.128
If I had a car, I could
get around much quicker.

22:09.365 --> 22:12.032
Uh, yeah, I mean... no.

22:12.068 --> 22:14.835
- No. Not-not right now. I just...
- What?

22:14.871 --> 22:15.903
That's too much to ask?

22:15.938 --> 22:17.638
After everything I've done for you?

22:17.673 --> 22:20.040
- Selina, it's not like that. I...
- (sighs) Forget it.

22:20.076 --> 22:22.710
It was stupid of me to even come here.

22:22.745 --> 22:25.080
Sel... I just... It's-it's
just not a good time.

22:25.681 --> 22:27.648
(scoffs)

22:27.683 --> 22:30.319
You're a selfish son of a
bitch. You know that, right?

22:36.125 --> 22:37.458
I'm sorry.

22:38.928 --> 22:40.895
I'm sorry.

22:44.267 --> 22:46.267
I'm sorry.

22:49.872 --> 22:51.839
(mimics Bruce's voice): I'm sorry.

23:05.179 --> 23:06.875
Selina?

23:06.939 --> 23:09.406
What do you want? I'm looking for
someone. I think you may have seen her.

23:09.441 --> 23:11.408
And if I have, why would I tell you?

23:11.443 --> 23:14.945
She's in trouble, and I can pay you.

23:16.014 --> 23:18.748
(sighs)

23:20.152 --> 23:21.718
I don't need your money.

23:21.753 --> 23:24.754
- So what do you need?
- Ivy.

23:24.790 --> 23:26.289
She's missing.

23:26.325 --> 23:27.824
- For how long?
- Too long.

23:28.775 --> 23:31.595
(sighs) Just... keep an eye
open for her, would you?

23:31.630 --> 23:33.997
Will do.

23:34.032 --> 23:36.132
She's from Indian Hill.

23:36.168 --> 23:37.549
Yeah.

23:39.571 --> 23:43.073
I saw her with Mooney,
but only for a day or two.

23:43.108 --> 23:45.576
Last I heard, she got a
job at The Narrows Bar.

23:46.573 --> 23:48.196
All right. Thanks.

23:52.885 --> 23:55.051
(door creaks open, shuts)

24:00.859 --> 24:02.826
(animal squeaking)

24:11.103 --> 24:13.069
(door opens)

24:16.675 --> 24:18.642
Who the hell are you?!

24:19.645 --> 24:21.645
You a cop?

24:22.681 --> 24:24.080
Nope.

24:24.116 --> 24:26.750
Well, if you're looking to rob
the place, you're too late.

24:26.785 --> 24:28.827
Fire took everything I had.

24:28.862 --> 24:30.862
I'm looking for someone.

24:30.897 --> 24:32.831
Her name's Alice.

24:32.866 --> 24:34.199
This some kind of joke?

24:34.234 --> 24:36.660
No. What's funny?

24:36.703 --> 24:39.371
That crazy bitch is the
one who started the fire.

24:40.688 --> 24:42.699
- Why'd she do that?
- How the hell do I know?!

24:42.734 --> 24:45.468
Said she cut herself. "Clean
yourself up then," I say.

24:45.504 --> 24:46.670
"You don't understand," she says.

24:46.705 --> 24:48.338
"My blood is on the
counter." Next thing I know,

24:48.373 --> 24:50.442
the whole damn kitchen's in flames.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.976
Someone's got to pay for this damage.

24:53.011 --> 24:56.379
You tell me where she
is, my client will pay.

24:56.415 --> 24:58.581
- Who's your client?
- You know where she is?

24:58.617 --> 25:00.483
If I did, would I be talking to you?

25:02.187 --> 25:04.154
Thanks for your time.

25:04.189 --> 25:06.189
- I say when we're done.
- (gun chamber clicks)

25:06.224 --> 25:08.858
Time to teach you some manners.

25:10.862 --> 25:13.530
(grunting)

25:13.565 --> 25:17.500
(loud thudding, grunting)

25:18.870 --> 25:20.236
- You had enough?
- (grunts)

25:20.272 --> 25:21.871
Not yet.

25:21.907 --> 25:23.740
(grunting)

25:23.809 --> 25:25.041
(thudding)

25:25.077 --> 25:27.711
(panting)

25:27.746 --> 25:29.913
Now I have.

25:30.949 --> 25:33.717
(groans)

25:33.752 --> 25:35.685
(sighs)

25:35.721 --> 25:37.687
(indistinct announcement over P.A.)

25:40.929 --> 25:42.207
I'm sorry for the delay.

25:42.245 --> 25:44.260
Gotham Friday nights keep us busy.

25:44.296 --> 25:47.063
- How you feeling?
- Uh. I'll be fine.

25:47.099 --> 25:48.798
Might want to take your shirt off.

25:48.834 --> 25:50.266
Don't want to bloody it up.

25:51.303 --> 25:53.436
(indistinct announcement over P.A.)

25:53.472 --> 25:56.439
(sighs)

25:59.555 --> 26:01.745
James Gordon, the policeman.

26:01.780 --> 26:03.446
Used to be.

26:05.550 --> 26:07.050
I don't need to tell you

26:07.085 --> 26:08.885
it's gonna hurt a little bit.

26:10.655 --> 26:12.322
There we go.

26:12.357 --> 26:14.457
Oh. Yeah.

26:21.800 --> 26:24.701
Lee speaks very highly of you.

26:28.440 --> 26:31.007
I'm Mario, Lee's fiancé.

26:35.347 --> 26:37.313
That's nice of her.

26:38.350 --> 26:40.383
Look, Jim,

26:40.419 --> 26:42.819
I don't know where your
head's at with all this,

26:43.884 --> 26:46.256
but I want you to know
that I love her very much.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.391
I'm gonna take good care of her.

26:51.129 --> 26:53.296
Good to know.

26:53.331 --> 26:55.465
So we're okay?

26:55.500 --> 26:57.700
Yeah. sure.

26:57.736 --> 26:59.436
Why wouldn't we be?

26:59.471 --> 27:01.938
Lee and I are old news,
water under the bridge.

27:02.720 --> 27:04.274
Won't get any problem from me.

27:04.309 --> 27:08.778
Uh... wish you both
nothing but the best.

27:08.814 --> 27:10.647
Thank you.

27:10.682 --> 27:12.082
All done.

27:21.693 --> 27:23.660
But, uh...

27:23.695 --> 27:26.396
you ever were to hurt her,

27:27.029 --> 27:29.138
I'd have to hunt you down and kill you.

27:30.035 --> 27:32.202
(laughs)

27:33.538 --> 27:35.205
Hey, uh, look, um,

27:35.240 --> 27:38.007
about three days ago, a
girl might have come in here

27:38.043 --> 27:39.309
with burns on her.

27:39.344 --> 27:41.010
Ring any bells? I need an address.

27:41.046 --> 27:42.320
Look familiar?

27:43.215 --> 27:46.216
(horns honking)

27:46.251 --> 27:48.485
(opera music plays)

27:55.753 --> 27:58.094
A public place. Smart.

27:58.130 --> 28:00.730
Knowing your flare for the dramatic,

28:00.765 --> 28:01.998
I felt it necessary.

28:02.033 --> 28:03.266
(laughs)

28:03.301 --> 28:04.701
How flattering.

28:04.736 --> 28:08.204
But why exert myself needlessly?

28:08.240 --> 28:10.273
The public sees me as a man

28:10.308 --> 28:12.542
of action, of change. You...

28:12.577 --> 28:16.045
You are yesterday's sad joke.

28:16.081 --> 28:19.002
While Galavan humiliated
this city, where were you?

28:20.075 --> 28:22.085
In a warehouse with a box on your head.

28:24.322 --> 28:25.955
You're an unstable lunatic, Penguin,

28:25.991 --> 28:28.691
and people are gonna
see right through you.

28:29.318 --> 28:32.529
I've got the judges,
the unions, the GCPD,

28:32.564 --> 28:34.731
and a whole team of
legal experts behind me.

28:34.766 --> 28:36.232
What do you got?

28:36.268 --> 28:38.001
I have me.

28:38.036 --> 28:40.036
(laughs)

28:40.071 --> 28:42.772
You're psychotic!

28:42.807 --> 28:45.875
(gun chambers clicking, women screaming)

28:45.911 --> 28:48.077
(woman whimpering)

28:49.106 --> 28:50.446
Not this time, Penguin.

28:50.482 --> 28:52.615
My head will not be put in a box again.

28:54.986 --> 28:57.100
Oh, you.

28:57.139 --> 29:01.752
So smart. Always one step ahead.

29:04.663 --> 29:07.263
(gun chambers clicking)

29:08.500 --> 29:10.300
Never three.

29:11.403 --> 29:14.337
Relax. I do not want you dead.

29:14.372 --> 29:15.939
Besides, what kind of
fun would an election be

29:15.974 --> 29:19.145
if I were the only candidate, huh? Oh.

29:21.169 --> 29:22.792
You're right about one thing, though.

29:22.814 --> 29:24.641
I do need a little help,

29:24.691 --> 29:28.259
and I have just the
right person in mind.

29:29.329 --> 29:31.362
(door creaks open)

29:31.398 --> 29:33.031
(man grunting)

29:33.066 --> 29:34.332
Hello?

29:34.367 --> 29:35.533
(man coughing)

29:35.569 --> 29:38.027
(loud knocking)

29:38.096 --> 29:40.597
(man groaning)

29:40.632 --> 29:41.965
Hello?

29:42.000 --> 29:44.033
(muffled groaning, loud knocking)

29:44.069 --> 29:46.135
(man groaning)

29:46.171 --> 29:48.638
(man laughing)

29:48.673 --> 29:52.609
(man speaking gibberish)

29:52.644 --> 29:56.613
(man yelling)

29:56.648 --> 29:59.824
No one lies to me! Don't lie!

29:59.859 --> 30:00.984
(gunshots)

30:01.019 --> 30:03.353
(man groaning)

30:03.388 --> 30:06.189
ALICE: Any of his blood get on you?

30:06.224 --> 30:07.357
No.

30:08.726 --> 30:10.106
Hello, Alice.

30:10.170 --> 30:12.099
I wasn't sure how he turned.

30:12.839 --> 30:14.906
Turned? What's wrong with him?

30:14.941 --> 30:16.708
He's infected.

30:16.743 --> 30:19.010
Infected with what?

30:19.045 --> 30:21.679
With me. Who are you?

30:21.715 --> 30:23.431
Why are you here?

30:23.444 --> 30:25.144
Your brother's looking for you.

30:27.878 --> 30:30.213
He can't... find me.

30:31.182 --> 30:33.049
Alice. Alice!

30:36.521 --> 30:38.588
(crickets chirping)

31:31.721 --> 31:33.053
- (door closes)
- ALFRED: He's gone.

31:34.290 --> 31:35.856
He's taken some of your clothes

31:35.891 --> 31:37.458
and the keys to the Roller.

31:37.493 --> 31:39.326
Cut his hair, too.

31:39.362 --> 31:41.362
To look more like you.

31:43.199 --> 31:45.199
We have to go after him.

31:45.234 --> 31:47.601
- (buzzer sounds)
- MAN: <i>I'm not sure</i>

31:47.637 --> 31:51.030
who scheduled this
meeting, Mr. Cobblepot,

31:51.065 --> 31:53.841
but as you can see, I have been burdened

31:53.876 --> 31:56.343
with restoring order to this facility,

31:56.379 --> 31:59.046
and that is no easy task.

31:59.081 --> 32:02.116
A man of your reputation
should not have been sent here

32:02.151 --> 32:03.550
to clean up Strange's wreckage.

32:03.586 --> 32:04.785
Indeed.

32:04.820 --> 32:07.021
Get off me! Let me go!

32:07.056 --> 32:09.823
You are aware of my ambitions?

32:09.859 --> 32:11.792
- (buzzer sounds)
- For office?

32:11.827 --> 32:13.527
Oh.

32:13.562 --> 32:15.496
Once mayor, I will grant you

32:15.531 --> 32:18.299
whatever position you care to request.

32:18.334 --> 32:20.100
Gotham's Head of Psychiatry,

32:20.136 --> 32:22.803
a chair on Gotham's Board of Health?

32:22.838 --> 32:24.471
In exchange for what exactly?

32:25.708 --> 32:28.842
Even though my victory is inevitable,

32:28.878 --> 32:32.813
I fear my campaign is
missing one key element.

32:32.848 --> 32:35.683
A colleague of mine is
locked up here. Unfairly.

32:35.718 --> 32:39.186
Are you suggesting that I
release a convicted criminal

32:39.221 --> 32:40.788
out onto the street?

32:40.823 --> 32:43.757
Well, yes. For your betterment.

32:43.793 --> 32:45.592
That would take extensive

32:45.628 --> 32:47.926
patient analysis, uh,
probational hearings,

32:47.990 --> 32:49.563
- appeals...
- (alarm rings)

32:49.598 --> 32:52.433
MAN (over P.A.): Lockdown
is now in full effect.

32:52.468 --> 32:53.767
Repeat, lockdown...

32:53.803 --> 32:56.236
Of course, there's always plan B.

32:56.272 --> 32:58.772
- I give you nothing...
- (gulps)

32:58.808 --> 33:00.641
but I make sure you remain here forever.

33:00.676 --> 33:02.509
<i>Not</i> as a warden, no.

33:02.545 --> 33:03.911
(chuckles)

33:03.946 --> 33:06.513
I would see you scrub floors

33:06.549 --> 33:07.881
and empty inmates' latrines.

33:07.917 --> 33:08.982
Oh...

33:10.820 --> 33:12.119
Options.

33:12.154 --> 33:15.089
(chuckles nervously)

33:15.124 --> 33:18.025
(watch ticking)

33:18.060 --> 33:20.994
Look into my eyes.

33:21.030 --> 33:22.296
Not around them,

33:22.365 --> 33:25.566
not above them, but into their center.

33:25.601 --> 33:29.036
- Now sleep.
- (watch ticking)

33:29.071 --> 33:31.038
(watch closes, ticking stops)

33:31.073 --> 33:34.141
Now, what would we like to see

33:34.176 --> 33:35.609
the lovely Miss Kean do?

33:35.644 --> 33:37.778
Physical feats?

33:37.813 --> 33:39.913
A trip into her psyche?

33:39.949 --> 33:42.082
She said we needed more whimsy.

33:42.118 --> 33:44.118
(audience laughs)

33:44.153 --> 33:46.387
Barbara?

33:46.422 --> 33:48.789
When I count down from three,

33:48.824 --> 33:50.124
you will find me irresistible.

33:50.159 --> 33:52.092
You will be madly

33:52.128 --> 33:53.127
in love with me.

33:53.162 --> 33:54.661
(laughing)

33:54.697 --> 33:55.896
Three...

33:55.931 --> 33:57.664
two...

33:57.700 --> 34:00.267
- one.
- (gasps)

34:00.302 --> 34:03.137
Barbara?

34:03.172 --> 34:04.605
Do you care for me?

34:04.640 --> 34:05.839
Oh, yes.

34:05.875 --> 34:08.339
- (audience gasps, murmurs)
- Do you love me?

34:09.322 --> 34:11.578
Very much.

34:11.614 --> 34:13.480
(audience gasping)

34:15.117 --> 34:16.717
- WOMAN: Ooh...
- But...

34:16.752 --> 34:19.205
what if I can't feel the same?

34:20.175 --> 34:22.656
- Oh, dear.
- What if I love another?

34:22.690 --> 34:23.824
I'm sorry,

34:23.859 --> 34:25.859
Barbara, my dear, but...

34:25.895 --> 34:27.194
(audience gasps)

34:27.228 --> 34:31.264
Three, two, one, awake.

34:31.300 --> 34:33.167
She's a bit sensitive to rejection.

34:33.202 --> 34:35.002
(chuckles)

34:35.953 --> 34:39.172
Ladies and gentlemen,
the great Jervis Tetch.

34:39.208 --> 34:41.141
(audience cheering)

34:41.177 --> 34:43.210
WOMAN: Bravo!

34:44.746 --> 34:47.614
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

34:47.650 --> 34:49.917
(quiet ballad plays in background)

34:55.831 --> 34:57.765
- Did you find her?
- I found her.

34:57.801 --> 34:59.267
Lost her.

34:59.302 --> 35:01.636
She shot a man and set fire to his body.

35:01.671 --> 35:03.137
Said she had an infection.

35:03.173 --> 35:04.839
Also said, she doesn't want anything

35:04.874 --> 35:06.307
to do with you.

35:06.343 --> 35:08.021
You want to tell me what
the hell is going on?

35:08.800 --> 35:11.446
It's complicated.

35:11.481 --> 35:14.549
My next stop will be the GCPD.

35:14.584 --> 35:16.017
You can explain it to them.

35:16.052 --> 35:18.119
Please, don't do that.

35:18.154 --> 35:20.054
Let's talk somewhere private.

35:20.090 --> 35:22.490
Allow me to explain the situation.

35:29.566 --> 35:31.666
(horns honk in distance)

35:35.038 --> 35:36.271
So what does Alice have in her blood

35:36.306 --> 35:37.605
that makes it so infectious?

35:37.641 --> 35:39.140
- (watch opens, ticks)
- She doesn't look sick to me.

35:39.175 --> 35:40.141
(door closes)

35:40.176 --> 35:41.709
She's not sick.

35:41.745 --> 35:44.345
- She's powerful, sir.
- Powerful how?

35:44.381 --> 35:47.015
- I need answers, Tetch!
- You deserve some.

35:47.050 --> 35:48.449
Do you hear my watch ticking?

35:48.485 --> 35:50.418
(watch ticking)

35:50.453 --> 35:51.586
Yeah.

35:51.621 --> 35:54.022
Listen closer.

35:54.057 --> 35:55.390
The ticking,

35:55.425 --> 35:58.793
it synchronizes with
your heartbeat, yes?

35:58.828 --> 36:02.063
(ticking slows)

36:02.098 --> 36:05.300
Look into my eyes.

36:05.335 --> 36:07.935
Not above them, or around them,

36:07.971 --> 36:09.804
into their center.

36:09.839 --> 36:11.973
Are you asleep, Jim?

36:12.008 --> 36:13.141
Yes.

36:13.176 --> 36:14.342
Show me.

36:14.377 --> 36:17.011
Take out your gun and
put it on the ground.

36:25.455 --> 36:26.554
Good.

36:26.589 --> 36:28.256
Now walk to the edge

36:28.325 --> 36:29.757
and climb onto the wall.

36:33.863 --> 36:36.164
Been such a long,

36:36.199 --> 36:39.167
hard road for you, Jim Gordon.

36:39.202 --> 36:43.871
You are so very tired
of life, aren't you?

36:43.907 --> 36:45.907
GORDON: Yes.

36:45.942 --> 36:48.142
Now you can rest, Jim.

36:51.381 --> 36:53.748
Close your eyes.

36:53.783 --> 36:56.250
Sleep forever.

37:09.471 --> 37:12.405
JERVIS: Deep down, you want to die, Jim.

37:12.441 --> 37:16.030
You want to end this miserable,

37:16.081 --> 37:19.079
empty, loveless life, don't you?

37:19.114 --> 37:20.802
- Yes!
- Yes.

37:20.828 --> 37:21.960
Let me help you.

37:21.995 --> 37:24.029
I'm going to count to ten.

37:24.064 --> 37:25.564
When I reach ten,

37:25.599 --> 37:27.399
you will simply

37:27.434 --> 37:29.067
step off the ledge

37:29.103 --> 37:32.070
and you will find everlasting peace.

37:34.041 --> 37:37.050
Ready? Yes.

37:38.011 --> 37:39.544
One.

37:39.580 --> 37:41.079
Two.

37:41.849 --> 37:42.681
Three.

37:42.716 --> 37:44.015
Four.

37:44.051 --> 37:46.716
- Five.
- Stop!

37:46.767 --> 37:48.066
Alice?

37:48.102 --> 37:49.267
Thank God!

37:49.303 --> 37:50.735
At last, I've found you!

37:50.771 --> 37:52.504
Tell that man to get off the ledge.

37:52.539 --> 37:53.572
Never mind him.

37:53.607 --> 37:55.574
- Put down the gun.
- Mister!

37:55.609 --> 37:56.741
Get down!

37:56.777 --> 37:58.844
He can't hear you.

37:58.879 --> 37:59.911
Don't come near me.

38:02.182 --> 38:03.448
Why are you here

38:03.484 --> 38:04.950
if you don't want to talk?

38:06.753 --> 38:08.320
Put the gun down, Alice.

38:08.355 --> 38:09.888
You're evil.

38:09.957 --> 38:11.356
Leave me alone!

38:11.391 --> 38:12.916
Or I'll kill you!

38:14.394 --> 38:17.101
But, Alice, I love you.

38:17.664 --> 38:18.530
(screams)

38:24.638 --> 38:25.770
(Alice screams)

38:36.116 --> 38:38.083
(both panting)

38:44.057 --> 38:45.924
Thank you.

38:52.132 --> 38:54.132
(crickets chirping)

38:55.202 --> 38:57.202
(dogs bark in distance)

39:00.741 --> 39:02.040
I'm sane.

39:02.075 --> 39:03.175
Absolutely.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.710
100%. I examined you myself.

39:06.847 --> 39:07.879
And the murder of Miss Kringle?

39:07.915 --> 39:09.447
Committed while you were insane.

39:09.483 --> 39:10.649
- Officer Dougherty.
- Insane.

39:10.684 --> 39:11.950
- Officer Pinkney.
- Insane.

39:11.985 --> 39:13.418
- And now I'm...
- Sane.

39:13.453 --> 39:16.288
And not responsible for any of the acts

39:16.323 --> 39:17.822
perpetrated during your sickness.

39:17.858 --> 39:20.225
You're a free man, Edward.

39:20.260 --> 39:21.960
Not to look a gift horse in the mouth,

39:21.995 --> 39:23.628
but how did you...

39:28.468 --> 39:30.936
(engine idling)

39:30.971 --> 39:33.305
Never mind.

39:33.340 --> 39:34.739
(window lowering)

39:36.777 --> 39:39.644
Hello, old friend.

39:44.931 --> 39:47.462
(elegant piano music playing)

39:47.500 --> 39:49.033
Still thinking about
your meeting with Jim?

39:49.068 --> 39:50.067
No.

39:50.102 --> 39:51.569
There's nothing left to say.

39:51.604 --> 39:52.736
It's all in the past now.

39:52.772 --> 39:53.737
It's been less than a year.

39:53.773 --> 39:55.439
I think there's plenty to say.

39:55.475 --> 39:57.241
After all you went through with him,

39:57.276 --> 39:58.609
I just need to know that
nothing's left unsaid.

39:58.644 --> 40:00.845
Well, you should speak
to him yourself, then.

40:00.880 --> 40:03.347
- I did.
- You did?

40:03.382 --> 40:05.115
- Mm-hmm.
- Something you could have mentioned

40:05.151 --> 40:06.684
the moment we sat down.

40:06.719 --> 40:07.918
When? How?

40:07.954 --> 40:09.420
It's not like I wasn't gonna tell you.

40:09.455 --> 40:11.422
He came into the ER, he needed stitches.

40:11.457 --> 40:12.623
Of course.

40:12.658 --> 40:15.259
So I took the opportunity
to introduce myself.

40:15.294 --> 40:18.496
He didn't make the connection
at first, because, um...

40:18.531 --> 40:20.998
you hadn't told him my name.

40:22.358 --> 40:24.168
It never came up.

40:25.204 --> 40:26.637
Right.

40:26.672 --> 40:28.572
What do you mean, "right"?

40:30.376 --> 40:32.443
FALCONE: Did I enter at a bad time?

40:35.948 --> 40:37.047
Glad you could make it, Dad.

40:37.083 --> 40:39.250
I'm honored that you invited me.

40:43.656 --> 40:45.656
(elegant piano music playing)

40:46.939 --> 40:49.393
When Mario was born,

40:49.428 --> 40:50.794
I promised my wife

40:50.830 --> 40:52.863
that he would never
be part of our thing.

40:52.899 --> 40:56.166
That we'd raise him to
lead a good, honest life.

40:56.202 --> 40:58.736
And we did.

40:58.771 --> 41:00.137
And he has.

41:01.207 --> 41:02.573
He can't use the Falcone name,

41:02.608 --> 41:05.175
but he's brought true
honor to the family.

41:05.211 --> 41:07.878
My wife is looking down on us now,

41:07.914 --> 41:09.346
and she's so proud and happy.

41:09.382 --> 41:10.514
She would love you, Lee.

41:10.550 --> 41:12.983
You're exactly the kind of woman

41:13.019 --> 41:14.685
she would have wished for her son.

41:14.720 --> 41:16.654
Thank you.

41:16.689 --> 41:19.690
There's only one thing
that would've worried her.

41:19.725 --> 41:20.986
Oh?

41:21.497 --> 41:23.827
My wife would say you're
a little too beautiful.

41:25.392 --> 41:28.399
All the great tragedies
start with a face like yours.

41:30.092 --> 41:32.002
Makes men fall in love
when they shouldn't.

41:33.285 --> 41:35.072
Makes them do crazy things.

41:35.107 --> 41:36.840
Dad, really?

41:36.876 --> 41:38.709
You're referring to Jim Gordon.

41:40.913 --> 41:42.880
I've spoken with him.

41:43.237 --> 41:45.049
He's moved on.

41:45.084 --> 41:46.850
I'm fine; he's fine.

41:46.886 --> 41:48.619
We both have.

41:48.654 --> 41:50.554
You've got nothing to worry about.

41:55.828 --> 41:57.294
Here's to both of you.

41:57.330 --> 41:58.888
A blessed union.

42:10.343 --> 42:12.309
(vehicle approaching)

42:27.927 --> 42:29.360
What the hell are you doing here?

42:29.395 --> 42:31.061
I wanted to apologize

42:31.097 --> 42:33.197
for the way I treated you last night.

42:34.623 --> 42:37.968
I'm sorry. I was insensitive and rude.

42:38.004 --> 42:40.404
Hmm.

42:40.439 --> 42:42.840
Does Alfred know you have his car?

42:42.875 --> 42:44.274
No.

42:44.310 --> 42:46.752
Why tell him? It's mine, not his.

42:48.276 --> 42:49.963
Would you like to go for a ride?

42:51.813 --> 42:53.250
Are you hungry?

42:53.285 --> 42:54.818
What's with you?

42:56.194 --> 42:58.122
You seem...

42:58.157 --> 43:00.057
different.

43:00.747 --> 43:02.331
Is that a bad thing?

43:02.740 --> 43:04.095
Mm.

43:05.297 --> 43:06.730
I could eat.

43:08.534 --> 43:10.774
Don't wait up, losers.
