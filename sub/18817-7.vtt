00:05.005 --> 00:06.339
[theme song playing]

00:54.554 --> 00:56.889
[hold music playing over phone]

01:00.060 --> 01:02.020
Oh! Oh.

01:09.736 --> 01:12.739
Abuelita,  give me back my yearbook!

01:12.822 --> 01:14.824
Your  quinces  is around the corner,

01:14.907 --> 01:16.826
and we need to pick a boy
to be your escort.

01:16.909 --> 01:18.245
There's no one in here. I just--

01:18.328 --> 01:21.623
Then use your phone
and Chapsmat somebody.

01:24.041 --> 01:26.043
You don't understand social media.
Abuelita--

01:26.128 --> 01:27.545
No, no, no. Of course I do.

01:27.629 --> 01:30.965
All you have to do is find a boy
and twat at him.

01:31.466 --> 01:32.967
[coughs softly]

01:34.386 --> 01:35.803
I hope you mean "tweet"?

01:35.887 --> 01:37.722
"Twat," "tweet." Same thing.

01:37.805 --> 01:39.516
Not the same thing,  Mami.

01:40.683 --> 01:43.186
Can you guys go fight somewhere else?
I'm on hold with the VA.

01:43.270 --> 01:46.814
Okay, but Elena has to pick
an escort by today!

01:46.898 --> 01:48.941
Or we will not have
enough time to prepare.

01:49.025 --> 01:50.652
But I wanna go to the street fair...

01:50.735 --> 01:52.820
and my  quinces  is two months away!

01:52.904 --> 01:54.781
[mockingly]  Jajaja. Qué  funny!

01:59.536 --> 02:03.540
We still have to pick
the other 14 members of the court.

02:03.623 --> 02:05.833
We have to choreograph the dances.

02:05.917 --> 02:08.085
We have to pick the weakest dancers

02:08.170 --> 02:11.339
and put them in the back
and put a curtain in front of them.

02:12.215 --> 02:15.718
Elena, pick by the end of the day,

02:15.802 --> 02:18.180
or your escort will be Cousin Orencio.

02:18.263 --> 02:23.226
Cousin Orencio smells like a Dorito
that died in a pool of Axe body spray.

02:24.060 --> 02:25.395
[mutters]

02:25.478 --> 02:27.647
[scoffs] Good luck
getting him out of  Tía  Mimi's basement.

02:27.730 --> 02:29.357
I'll get him out of  Tía  Mimi's basement.

02:29.441 --> 02:30.525
Hey, no, don't touch that phone!

02:30.608 --> 02:32.777
¡Ay!  [inhales sharply]  Ay, ay,  Elena.

02:33.695 --> 02:36.990
[sighs] Just take the yearbook
and pick somebody.

02:38.366 --> 02:39.367
[sighs] Fine!

02:40.410 --> 02:41.911
This should be fun!

02:42.995 --> 02:44.247
Pick whoever you want.

02:44.331 --> 02:47.792
As long as he is a dancer,
and he is Cuban,

02:47.875 --> 02:50.628
and he is handsome, and I'm coming in.

02:52.171 --> 02:53.381
[sighs]

02:57.469 --> 02:59.262
-[music stops]
-Hello?

03:00.222 --> 03:01.223
[music resumes]

03:02.474 --> 03:03.766
Ah!

03:03.850 --> 03:06.519
That's cold, VA. Ice cold.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.481
[knocking at door]

03:14.485 --> 03:17.864
Alvarez, let's go!
There's a street fair downstairs.

03:17.947 --> 03:19.908
Beer, food... this!

03:20.950 --> 03:22.994
[electronic sword clanking]

03:30.418 --> 03:31.669
Did you buy that?

03:32.837 --> 03:33.921
I won it...

03:34.005 --> 03:36.383
after spending 40 bucks at the ring toss.

03:38.092 --> 03:39.719
Wait, are you still on hold with the VA?

03:39.802 --> 03:40.720
No!

03:41.388 --> 03:42.847
I got right through.

03:43.848 --> 03:45.850
[both laughing]

03:47.101 --> 03:48.978
Wait, can I leave this up here
for safekeeping?

03:49.061 --> 03:50.563
-Who's gonna steal that?
-Schneider.

03:50.647 --> 03:51.773
Hide it in my mom's room.

03:52.357 --> 03:53.483
Anyway, I can't go.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.985
Today's the day
I finally get through to Jolene.

03:56.069 --> 03:56.986
[sighs deeply]

03:57.069 --> 03:59.947
She's my white whale. My Bigfoot.

04:00.031 --> 04:03.284
My meal cooked by my mother
using no pork products of any kind.

04:03.868 --> 04:06.162
[laughs] Hey, I served.
I get it.

04:06.246 --> 04:08.581
But I try to never deal with the VA.

04:08.665 --> 04:10.958
I stopped calling them
about my punctured eardrum.

04:11.042 --> 04:12.419
That seems like a bad plan.

04:12.502 --> 04:13.962
Oh, thanks. I got it on sale.

04:16.130 --> 04:17.298
[Penelope shouts] I'll see you down...

04:17.382 --> 04:18.800
Yeah, she can't hear me.

04:18.883 --> 04:20.260
[woman on telephone]
Pain Management Department.

04:20.343 --> 04:22.387
Last name and last four digits
of your social--

04:22.470 --> 04:24.639
Alvarez, 2294... [groans]

04:24.722 --> 04:25.848
Are you... are you...

04:25.932 --> 04:26.933
Are you... are you there?

04:29.644 --> 04:30.978
Say something.

04:33.523 --> 04:35.400
-Please hold.
-Not that!

04:36.734 --> 04:38.486
-Hi.
-Hey, Ms. Alvarez.

04:38.570 --> 04:40.363
Hey, guys. How was baseball?

04:40.446 --> 04:41.531
Terrible!

04:42.115 --> 04:43.658
I mean, they played great.

04:44.701 --> 04:46.369
But my snack game was way off!

04:46.453 --> 04:49.205
The kids barely touched
my black olive tapenade.

04:50.498 --> 04:51.541
Thanks for helping out,

04:51.624 --> 04:53.668
but maybe next time pick a food
a kid would wanna eat...

04:54.252 --> 04:55.295
or has heard of.

04:56.504 --> 05:01.175
Yeah, and maybe next time,
don't hand out masks with my face on them.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.472
Handsome, but creepy.

05:10.226 --> 05:11.811
[groans]

05:15.106 --> 05:17.233
[exaggerated whimpering]

05:19.819 --> 05:21.363
-Ah--
-What,  Mami?

05:23.906 --> 05:27.285
Your daughter is so dramatic.

05:29.829 --> 05:30.955
No puedo más.

05:31.456 --> 05:33.750
Mami,  don't worry, she will pick someone.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.835
-[inhales sharply]  ¡Ay!
-You okay, Mom?

05:35.918 --> 05:36.753
Yeah.

05:37.294 --> 05:40.256
I just need to talk to Jolene
and get my shoulder squared away.

05:40.340 --> 05:43.509
Here, take one of your pain pills.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.639
I thought you don't want me
to take  "las drogas"?

05:47.722 --> 05:50.392
The pain in your body is real.

05:50.475 --> 05:53.185
The pain in your mind is in your head.

05:54.479 --> 05:55.688
[sighs]

05:57.607 --> 05:59.817
-What happened, Ms. Alvarez?
-It's nothing, Finn.

05:59.901 --> 06:01.486
Hey, don't be so modest.

06:01.569 --> 06:04.572
She jacked her shoulder up in Afghanistan,
being a hero.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.408
[scoffs] "Hero."

06:06.491 --> 06:08.325
Kabul, 2004.

06:09.326 --> 06:14.290
I was assisting in surgery
when a mortar hit close to the OR.

06:14.373 --> 06:17.419
The blast caused
a pallet of surgical gloves

06:17.502 --> 06:19.378
to fall on my shoulder.

06:20.713 --> 06:22.424
The last part is not as impressive.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.426
But still, it is a war wound.

06:26.677 --> 06:29.555
Well... I thank you for your service,
Ms. Alvarez.

06:34.060 --> 06:36.270
Yeah, don't do that.

06:37.939 --> 06:40.316
So can we have some money for the fair?

06:40.400 --> 06:42.402
Sure. Grab ten bucks from my purse.

06:43.277 --> 06:44.237
[Alex clicks tongue]

06:45.238 --> 06:46.364
[groans]

06:50.493 --> 06:52.036
[groans loudly]

06:54.872 --> 06:56.373
-[sighs]
-What,  papito?

06:57.459 --> 07:01.337
Well, it's just we need at least 20
to do anything fun.

07:02.046 --> 07:03.047
But it's okay.

07:04.006 --> 07:06.509
We can watch the other kids
have a good time.

07:08.636 --> 07:09.637
That sounds great.

07:10.513 --> 07:12.306
You don't even need the ten dollars.

07:13.558 --> 07:15.267
Okay, I get it. I'll take the ten.

07:15.351 --> 07:17.479
Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
Guys, don't go anywhere.

07:17.562 --> 07:20.147
I have kind of an exciting announcement.

07:20.231 --> 07:23.067
Something went terribly wrong
in your adult diaper?

07:28.448 --> 07:30.032
It's athleisure wear.

07:31.493 --> 07:34.370
But the good news is,
after months of planning,

07:34.454 --> 07:38.916
the members of my college band
have finally put aside our differences...

07:39.416 --> 07:42.086
and we're reuniting to play
at the fair this afternoon.

07:49.469 --> 07:52.638
All right. Maybe this will entice you.

07:58.102 --> 07:58.978
Nope.

07:59.646 --> 08:02.940
Well, it should,
because my band, Full Sail,

08:03.024 --> 08:04.150
plays yacht rock.

08:06.110 --> 08:07.862
¿Qué es el  yacht rock?

08:07.945 --> 08:09.989
-Mami,  don't ask--
-Yacht rock...

08:10.865 --> 08:14.744
is like easy listening music,
but even easier to listen to.

08:16.245 --> 08:17.955
It's cool, but not too cool.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.625
Soulful, but not too soulful.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.294
I'm excited, but not too excited.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.005
And they paid you for this?

08:26.088 --> 08:28.550
Oh, no, I had to grease a few palms
to make it happen.

08:28.633 --> 08:29.676
So you're paying them?

08:29.759 --> 08:31.260
I don't want
to get into the economics of it.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.556
But this gig is really important to me.

08:35.640 --> 08:37.350
These guys were like family.

08:37.433 --> 08:40.603
I used to show up at their dorm rooms
unannounced and just hang out

08:40.686 --> 08:42.813
for hours and hours and hours.

08:43.814 --> 08:46.776
I can't imagine what that would feel like.

08:46.859 --> 08:49.111
-[woman on telephone]  Hello?
-[stammers] Guys...

08:49.195 --> 08:51.363
Yeah, I'm here. Did you find Jolene?

08:51.447 --> 08:54.075
-Just one more question, ma'am.
-Sure. Anything.

08:54.158 --> 08:57.369
Was that "Phillips" with a "P,"
or "Fillips" with an "F"?

08:57.453 --> 08:58.913
[softly] What?

08:58.996 --> 09:01.791
Alvarez! With an "A"!

09:04.210 --> 09:05.294
Hold, please.

09:05.377 --> 09:07.338
[dial tone humming]

09:07.421 --> 09:08.381
Wait, wait. Hello?

09:09.340 --> 09:10.299
Hello?

09:10.382 --> 09:11.884
[whimpering] Hello?

09:11.968 --> 09:14.220
No! Come on.

09:15.387 --> 09:16.639
[muffled screaming]

09:18.641 --> 09:21.018
[hold music playing]

09:24.105 --> 09:25.189
Aw!

09:43.666 --> 09:44.667
[music stops]

09:44.751 --> 09:46.586
[woman on recording]
Did you know that over 40% of trips

09:46.669 --> 09:50.006
to the emergency room
are caused by preventable accidents?

09:50.089 --> 09:50.965
That seems high.

09:52.341 --> 09:53.843
-[Schneider groans]
-What happened?

09:53.926 --> 09:56.387
It was a totally preventable accident!

09:56.470 --> 09:57.471
[groans]

09:57.554 --> 09:59.807
We were setting up for the show
and our keytarist

09:59.890 --> 10:01.934
threw a decorative anchor at me.

10:03.686 --> 10:04.854
Okay, I'm sorry you're hurt,

10:04.937 --> 10:07.690
but it sounds like I just missed
the best part of your show.

10:08.190 --> 10:10.985
This is why Full Sail broke up
in the first place.

10:11.068 --> 10:13.195
Too many passionate personalities.

10:13.279 --> 10:16.991
I wanted to open with Toto.
Skip wanted to open with Steely Dan.

10:17.074 --> 10:20.453
Oh, you can't open with the Dan.
They're dangerously smooth.

10:24.123 --> 10:26.042
What are you doing here, Doc?
Why aren't you at work?

10:26.668 --> 10:27.669
What? Who, me?

10:29.045 --> 10:32.423
Well... you know,
I always love a good street fair.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.925
And-- and since you took
a half day off of work,

10:35.009 --> 10:36.052
I thought...

10:36.719 --> 10:38.304
maybe I should, too.

10:38.596 --> 10:39.639
YOLO!

10:42.808 --> 10:45.353
It stands for, "You Only Live Once."

10:47.521 --> 10:48.731
But why didn't you tell me
you were gonna be here

10:48.815 --> 10:49.857
when I saw you earlier?

10:49.941 --> 10:52.068
What's with all the questions?

10:52.151 --> 10:54.403
Is this Castro's Cuba or America?

10:55.154 --> 10:58.240
You-- you know I could take a look
at that eye for you myself,

10:58.324 --> 11:00.826
but there was
a lot of second-hand doobie smoke

11:00.910 --> 11:02.453
at that fair and, uh...

11:02.536 --> 11:05.497
I worry that I may have
a bit of a contact high.

11:06.833 --> 11:08.292
Here. Let me see.

11:10.044 --> 11:10.961
Is that glitter?

11:11.045 --> 11:14.215
It's called stage sparkle.
Can you please just get it out?

11:15.674 --> 11:17.927
If I had a magnifying glass,
I could probably get it out.

11:18.010 --> 11:19.553
Oh, I have one in my costume trunk.

11:20.554 --> 11:23.224
Halloween box. Tool kit. Man's tool kit.

11:24.516 --> 11:26.643
Okay, whatever. Come on, let's just go.
Quick. Come on.

11:26.728 --> 11:29.230
Mami,  I'm still on hold,
so if they pick up, remember...

11:29.313 --> 11:31.107
Alvarez, 2294.

11:34.944 --> 11:36.612
[hold music playing]

11:45.246 --> 11:46.288
[music stops]

11:46.372 --> 11:49.792
[woman on recording]  Remember
to self-screen for testicular cancer.

11:52.754 --> 11:53.755
Good advice.

11:56.090 --> 11:59.218
My husband always asked me
to check for him.

12:10.604 --> 12:11.605
Daily.

12:16.652 --> 12:17.779
So, um...

12:18.362 --> 12:20.531
Thanks for inviting me to the fair.

12:21.490 --> 12:24.076
You don't think Penelope suspects
that we went together?

12:24.160 --> 12:26.620
Or am I just paranoid from all that grass?

12:27.538 --> 12:31.250
I don't want her to think that we were
on a date or something.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.169
[laughs]

12:33.252 --> 12:35.546
No, she wouldn't think that.
[chuckles]

12:35.629 --> 12:37.423
It'd be ridiculous.

12:38.465 --> 12:41.969
Well, ridiculous is a little strong,
but...

12:44.555 --> 12:45.389
Lydia...

12:47.016 --> 12:49.435
you were so wonderful to me
at my birthday party.

12:50.019 --> 12:55.149
And I would just be very happy
if we could continue whatever this is.

12:55.232 --> 12:56.233
[chuckles]

12:57.318 --> 12:59.320
[romantic music playing over phone]

13:09.205 --> 13:13.167
Can I make you a  café cubano ?

13:14.543 --> 13:16.378
Sí, por favor.

13:17.421 --> 13:18.630
Rosetta Stone.

13:21.425 --> 13:23.886
-[device beeping]
-Oh,  espere.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.055
It's time to take my pills.

13:32.311 --> 13:34.980
Actually, I'm glad you reminded me.

13:55.834 --> 13:59.171
So... here is to Vitamin D.

14:00.631 --> 14:02.341
-Vitamin D.
-[laughs]

14:06.595 --> 14:10.432
And, uh, estrogen replacement...

14:12.101 --> 14:13.936
to keep me young.

14:17.064 --> 14:19.316
For my cholesterol...

14:19.400 --> 14:20.734
so I don't die.

14:24.613 --> 14:25.447
What's going on here?

14:25.531 --> 14:27.491
Nothing! We're just taking drugs.

14:30.411 --> 14:32.746
So, uh, how is Schneider doing?

14:33.580 --> 14:35.166
Hey, guys, I'm heading down.

14:37.751 --> 14:40.588
This yacht rock band
is about to be boarded by a pirate.

14:41.588 --> 14:43.382
The sexy kind.
Not the kind that steals music.

14:43.465 --> 14:45.051
Although you can record the show for free.

14:46.510 --> 14:47.761
Just look for the big crowd.

14:47.845 --> 14:50.014
That's the kebab truck.
We're next to that.

14:50.681 --> 14:53.767
We're going too. Elena?

14:54.393 --> 14:57.897
When I get back,
I'm going to call Cousin Orencio.

14:57.980 --> 14:59.523
[Elena screams]

15:01.108 --> 15:03.319
Sometimes you have to poke the bear.

15:05.612 --> 15:07.239
[woman]  Pain Management Department.
Can I help you?

15:07.323 --> 15:09.909
-Alvarez, 2294.
-Who are you holding for?

15:09.992 --> 15:13.621
-Jolene. I'm holding for Jolene.
-Transferring you now.

15:13.704 --> 15:14.955
-[gasps]
-[line ringing]

15:15.039 --> 15:17.917
Oh, my God. It's finally happening.

15:21.086 --> 15:22.755
-Okay.
-[line continues ringing]

15:23.255 --> 15:24.340
Come on.

15:25.382 --> 15:26.675
Pick up, Jolene.

15:27.718 --> 15:28.760
Pick up.

15:29.762 --> 15:30.846
Maybe you're peeing.

15:31.597 --> 15:34.224
That's okay. I have to pee,
but I'm gonna hold it.

15:35.935 --> 15:38.270
Maybe you're grabbing
your four o'clock snack

15:38.354 --> 15:39.730
away from your desk.

15:39.813 --> 15:42.733
I'm not here to judge. You do you
at the vending machine, boo-boo.

15:44.401 --> 15:46.153
Answer the damn phone, Jolene!

15:46.988 --> 15:47.989
[man]  Hello?

15:49.615 --> 15:50.783
Wait. Who is this?

15:51.241 --> 15:53.327
Please be a man named Jolene.

15:55.120 --> 15:56.372
No, this is Tad.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.712
But this is Jolene's extension, right?

16:03.795 --> 16:07.799
No, I think they accidentally
transferred you to an empty office.

16:07.883 --> 16:09.510
[scoffing]

16:09.593 --> 16:13.222
Well, it's not empty now,
'cause I'm standing here talking to you.

16:14.640 --> 16:18.435
But after I hang up and leave,
it'll be empty again.

16:20.312 --> 16:22.856
I just want an appointment
with a chiropractor.

16:23.065 --> 16:25.693
I'm Alvarez, 2294.

16:25.776 --> 16:27.361
Can you help me, Tad?

16:27.444 --> 16:28.445
Slow down.

16:31.615 --> 16:34.285
Let me see what we have here.

16:34.368 --> 16:36.037
[mutters]

16:36.120 --> 16:38.914
Alvarez, 2294.

16:42.668 --> 16:45.129
-Oh.
-Oh?

16:45.212 --> 16:47.798
What's "oh"? Don't "oh" me, Tad.

16:48.465 --> 16:52.011
Sorry, but you need a referral
from your primary care physician.

16:52.636 --> 16:53.887
[stammers] I have one.

16:53.970 --> 16:58.017
I sent a copy of it to Jolene's office,
like, two months ago.

16:58.100 --> 17:00.811
You should probably talk to Jolene, then.

17:00.894 --> 17:02.229
What?

17:02.313 --> 17:03.647
I know, Tad!

17:03.730 --> 17:04.940
So, now what?

17:05.024 --> 17:07.776
Sorry. Can you fax a new one over?

17:09.028 --> 17:11.196
Fax it? You mean, e-mail it?

17:11.947 --> 17:13.115
[Tad laughing]

17:16.285 --> 17:17.286
Okay...

17:17.786 --> 17:20.539
So you want me to get in a time machine

17:20.622 --> 17:23.542
and go back to when they used
fax machines

17:23.625 --> 17:26.503
to send you something that
I know for a fact you already have?

17:27.087 --> 17:29.590
Well, if I had a time machine,

17:29.673 --> 17:31.425
I don't think I'd go back in time

17:31.508 --> 17:33.135
-and fax things.
-Oh, my God.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.596
I'd buy a lotto ticket.

17:35.679 --> 17:38.474
Okay, you know what? Focus, Tad!

17:38.974 --> 17:39.892
Okay.

17:40.642 --> 17:42.519
I think the market down the street

17:42.603 --> 17:45.814
has a fax machine
next to the off-brand candy bars.

17:45.897 --> 17:47.983
After the day I've had,
I deserve a Slickers.

17:49.025 --> 17:50.569
¡Elena, ven acá!

17:50.652 --> 17:53.114
-Tad, give me five minutes.
-Okay.

17:53.197 --> 17:55.741
I need you to watch the phone
while I run out. Remember--

17:55.824 --> 17:57.659
Alvarez, 2294. I know.

17:57.743 --> 18:00.204
If Tad picks up, keep him on the line.

18:01.872 --> 18:04.083
Did you take down
a bag and a half of Cheetos?

18:04.166 --> 18:05.417
Step off, girl.

18:17.096 --> 18:19.306
Hello?  Abuelita?

18:19.640 --> 18:20.516
Elena?

18:20.599 --> 18:22.559
Alex, no one's home. Your mom just left.

18:22.643 --> 18:24.770
Just grab some pills
and let's get out of here.

18:24.853 --> 18:26.146
Yeah, I don't know.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.732
Maybe we should just hang out
and play video games?

18:28.815 --> 18:31.193
[scoffs] Come on,
your mom won't even notice.

18:31.277 --> 18:34.905
I heard Shane Lennon sold
one of his dad's pills for 20 bucks.

18:36.573 --> 18:40.077
Or I could just take you off
the group chat with all of our friends.

18:41.078 --> 18:43.497
The only thing worse than being
in a group chat...

18:43.789 --> 18:45.291
is not being in a group chat.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.710
[sighs] Fine, I'll do it.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.838
Great. I'll stand guard
and if I see somebody coming, I'll yell...

18:52.756 --> 18:54.258
"Tumbleweed." That's our code word.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.467
Why is that the code word?

18:55.551 --> 18:57.427
I don't know. Shut up.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.932
No, you shut up.

19:09.773 --> 19:11.608
-[exhales heavily]
-[pills rattle]

19:22.411 --> 19:23.662
[door opens]

19:30.294 --> 19:32.296
[hold music playing]

19:52.358 --> 19:54.943
[woman on recording]  Having trouble
communicating with your family members?

19:55.026 --> 19:56.528
[scoffs] You could say that.

19:58.154 --> 20:00.366
Feeling like no one understands you?

20:00.449 --> 20:01.366
Yep.

20:01.658 --> 20:04.745
Losing your appetite
due to depression or anxiety?

20:06.538 --> 20:08.164
Obviously not.

20:13.712 --> 20:14.588
[sighs]

20:14.671 --> 20:18.091
Do you have advice for feeling
like the weirdo in your family?

20:20.052 --> 20:22.429
For explaining that you don't want
to pick a boy

20:22.513 --> 20:24.598
to be the escort to your  quinces,
'cause...

20:24.681 --> 20:26.934
[scoffs] you don't even know
if you like boys.

20:27.434 --> 20:29.478
-Reach out and talk to someone.
-[Elena scoffs]

20:30.979 --> 20:31.897
Yeah.

20:32.105 --> 20:34.191
That'll go great. How do I even do that?

20:34.900 --> 20:37.528
"Hey, Mom, I think I might like girls."

20:37.611 --> 20:39.238
-[electronic sword clanking]
-[Alex] Damn it!

20:46.787 --> 20:49.081
What are you doing here?
Why are you spying on me?

20:51.166 --> 20:52.668
Tumbleweed.

20:57.172 --> 20:58.757
I'm not even gonna ask about the sword.

20:58.840 --> 21:00.133
What are you doing with Mom's pills?

21:00.717 --> 21:01.885
-I can explain.
-Mmm-hmm.

21:02.469 --> 21:03.553
I was stealing them.

21:06.306 --> 21:07.933
Mom is going to kill you.

21:08.016 --> 21:10.811
I mean, quite literally,
she is going to kill you.

21:10.894 --> 21:14.147
Resuscitate you, kill you again,
and then ground your lifeless body.

21:15.566 --> 21:18.193
I didn't really want to.
It was Finn's idea.

21:18.277 --> 21:19.403
Please don't tell Mom.

21:20.153 --> 21:23.073
I won't, but what's Finn's problem anyway?

21:23.156 --> 21:25.659
You're gonna let him turn you into
a little Latino drug dealer?

21:25.742 --> 21:26.785
Stereotype much?

21:26.868 --> 21:29.245
It's not drug dealing. God.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.540
We were just going to sell pills
to get some money.

21:34.460 --> 21:35.502
Oh.

21:35.586 --> 21:37.045
[sighs]

21:38.505 --> 21:39.631
[sighs]

21:43.719 --> 21:44.720
So...

21:45.637 --> 21:48.432
did you hear what I was saying
while you were back there?

21:49.558 --> 21:52.102
Nah, that curtain is pretty thick.

21:55.397 --> 21:58.484
You can't say anything to anyone.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.694
It's not that I'm embarrassed.
I'm just not sure.

22:01.278 --> 22:02.904
I promise. I won't say anything.

22:03.279 --> 22:06.450
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
It's not like you'd be in trouble.

22:07.618 --> 22:09.995
I mean, who cares, right?

22:12.497 --> 22:13.623
Good brother.

22:14.666 --> 22:16.960
Now I really don't understand
what's going on.

22:18.629 --> 22:19.963
[woman on phone]  Hello?

22:20.046 --> 22:22.799
[both shouting] Alvarez! 2294!

22:22.883 --> 22:24.385
Who are you holding for?

22:24.468 --> 22:27.471
I don't know, but please don't hang up!
We gotta keep her talking.

22:27.554 --> 22:30.432
-Is this Penelope Alvarez?
-Yes!

22:30.516 --> 22:31.517
I'm Penelope.

22:31.600 --> 22:35.311
I'm a badass, who served in Afghanistan
doing army stuff! Hooah!

22:37.147 --> 22:38.440
And I'm her son, Alex.

22:38.524 --> 22:41.860
I know my mom sounds young,
but these days, babies having babies...

22:41.943 --> 22:43.236
I'm back!

22:43.319 --> 22:45.406
Thank God.
I was running out of material.

22:46.364 --> 22:47.449
What happened to you?

22:47.533 --> 22:50.326
I got roughed up pushing through the crowd
on the way to the market.

22:50.411 --> 22:51.953
That kebab line is no joke.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.457
-[woman on phone]  Hello?
-Hello, hello? Who is this?

22:55.541 --> 22:58.001
This is Jolene in Pain Management.

22:58.084 --> 23:01.337
Oh, Jolene! Oh, my God, Jolene.

23:01.422 --> 23:02.297
Hey, let's go.

23:02.380 --> 23:05.383
It's time for the smooth,
summer sounds of Full Sail.

23:05.926 --> 23:07.219
Schneider made me say that.

23:07.719 --> 23:10.013
Wait! Let me warm up my voice
before the show.

23:10.096 --> 23:11.306
Boo...

23:11.389 --> 23:12.683
Yep, I'm good.

23:14.601 --> 23:15.686
What happened to Tad?

23:15.769 --> 23:17.854
Would you like me to transfer you to Tad?
One moment.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.899
No, no, no! No! I want you, Jolene.

23:20.982 --> 23:22.358
Can I help you?

23:22.443 --> 23:25.571
Yes, ma'am. Oh! I'm so excited.

23:25.654 --> 23:28.657
I'm sorry, I don't mean to fangirl out,
but you are Jolene.

23:29.658 --> 23:30.742
Yes, I am.

23:31.368 --> 23:32.244
Whoo!

23:32.786 --> 23:34.996
It has been a trip getting to you, mama.

23:35.246 --> 23:38.374
Okay, so I just want to make
an appointment with the chiropractor.

23:38.459 --> 23:40.461
-So if you have anything for next week--
-I'm sorry.

23:40.544 --> 23:42.546
You're gonna have to call back on Monday.

23:44.339 --> 23:46.800
-Why can't you help me now?
-I have to go.

23:48.594 --> 23:49.636
Okay.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.764
I-- I don't mean to be difficult.

23:52.848 --> 23:54.516
Still a huge fan.

23:54.600 --> 23:57.018
But isn't the VA open until 5:00?

23:57.102 --> 24:02.357
It is, but if I don't catch the 4:30 bus,
I have to take the 4:45.

24:03.275 --> 24:04.276
So...

24:07.863 --> 24:10.282
I've been trying to get in contact
with you for a month.

24:10.365 --> 24:12.701
You can't take five minutes
to help me out?

24:12.784 --> 24:16.288
Well, you don't understand.
I have to leave.

24:18.289 --> 24:20.458
Well, then, walk me through it, Jolene.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.168
Because I don't understand.

24:22.252 --> 24:24.170
What I do understand is...

24:24.254 --> 24:26.465
I went to war, I got hurt.

24:27.090 --> 24:30.426
And when I came back, there was
supposed be an organization set up

24:30.511 --> 24:33.722
to help me and other veterans
get the help we need.

24:33.805 --> 24:38.476
So I don't get why it's so hard
to make a simple appointment.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.103
And I'm one of the lucky ones.

24:40.478 --> 24:46.317
My husband has bad knees,
a bad back and traumatic brain injury.

24:47.235 --> 24:48.779
He's not getting help.

24:48.862 --> 24:54.826
Partly because he's a stubborn ass,
but mostly because of this insane process.

24:54.910 --> 24:58.163
And because he's not getting help,
he almost did something stupid.

24:59.372 --> 25:03.126
I lost someone in my unit
because she did do something stupid.

25:03.209 --> 25:06.922
So, please, enlighten me, Jolene,

25:07.005 --> 25:09.925
as to why helping soldiers
is less important

25:10.008 --> 25:12.218
than you catching your goddamn bus.

25:14.220 --> 25:16.014
-Hold, please.
-[scoffs]

25:18.433 --> 25:20.268
-[hold music playing]
-[sighing]

25:41.414 --> 25:42.415
[music stops]

25:42.499 --> 25:44.626
[Jolene]  I have set
a chiropractor appointment

25:44.709 --> 25:47.462
for Alvarez, Penelope, 2294,

25:47.545 --> 25:50.882
next Monday at 11:00 a.m. with Dr. Pearl.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.258
Will that work for you, ma'am?

25:52.342 --> 25:54.344
Yes, that would be great.

25:54.427 --> 25:55.804
-Thank you so mu--
-[line disconnects]

25:57.180 --> 25:58.932
[laughs]

25:59.557 --> 26:00.851
Classic Jolene.

26:03.729 --> 26:05.897
[sighs] Yeah!

26:05.981 --> 26:07.691
[gasps]  ¡Ay!  Okay.

26:07.774 --> 26:09.610
[whispers] That was a bit too much.

26:09.693 --> 26:11.111
[sighs deeply]

26:12.028 --> 26:13.697
Ah! Yeah!

26:13.780 --> 26:16.282
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah...

26:22.664 --> 26:24.332
-[panting]
-[band playing outside]

26:25.458 --> 26:26.542
Yeah.

26:26.627 --> 26:27.919
All right.

26:28.920 --> 26:32.007
[Schneider over PA] Ahoy, Echo Parrrk!
