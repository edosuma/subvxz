WEBVTT

00:01.502 --> 00:04.169
I cannot believe the kids are
still asleep on a Sunday.

00:04.171 --> 00:06.038
I know, this is nice.

00:06.040 --> 00:07.706
Just the two of us.

00:07.708 --> 00:08.741
Hmm.

00:08.743 --> 00:09.675
It's romantic, even.

00:09.677 --> 00:12.044
(both laugh)

00:12.046 --> 00:13.312
What's that?

00:14.582 --> 00:16.215
My hand-- too early?

00:16.217 --> 00:19.218
No, no, that's your parents' RV.

00:19.220 --> 00:20.653
What?

00:20.654 --> 00:22.087
I thought they were driving
around the country,

00:22.089 --> 00:24.056
going 40 in the fast lane
and wearing

00:24.058 --> 00:26.058
giant sunglasses
over their regular glasses.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.161
Well, my mom called me
from Santa Fe last week.

00:29.163 --> 00:32.731
All she talked about was buying
salsa from a nice Mexican lady.

00:32.733 --> 00:35.134
Why do they always have
to mention the ethnicity

00:35.136 --> 00:36.335
of the people in their stories?

00:36.337 --> 00:38.103
Because they're
old white people.

00:39.206 --> 00:41.774
That's what they do.

00:41.776 --> 00:43.442
Oh, man, that's what I just did.

00:43.444 --> 00:46.378
Oh, wait. Whoa, whoa,
where are you going?

00:46.380 --> 00:49.048
To welcome them.
(muttering):
Oh, oh, wait. Oh, oh.

00:49.050 --> 00:51.216
Before you go out there,
I should probably mention

00:51.218 --> 00:53.352
that I never told them
about you going back to work

00:53.354 --> 00:54.753
and me watching the kids.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.755
What? Well, why not?

00:56.757 --> 00:59.224
I knew if I told them, I would
never hear the end of it.

00:59.226 --> 01:01.193
Plus, I thought maybe
by the time they got back,

01:01.195 --> 01:02.494
this whole thing with you
going back to work

01:02.496 --> 01:04.163
would've blown over.

01:04.165 --> 01:05.264
My dreams and aspirations

01:05.266 --> 01:07.132
would've just blown over?

01:07.134 --> 01:09.201
Yeah, things blow over.

01:09.203 --> 01:11.336
Like the way you're
feeling right now.

01:11.338 --> 01:12.838
Blow it over!

01:12.840 --> 01:14.273
(door opens)

01:14.275 --> 01:16.308
Oh, there they are!
Mom, Dad,

01:16.310 --> 01:17.810
what a surprise.
Hi, Joe.

01:17.812 --> 01:19.211
Ah!

01:19.213 --> 01:20.679
Mmm. Good to see you.

01:20.681 --> 01:22.214
Ooh! Ooh!
Oh.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.083
(laughing)
Look at you.

01:24.085 --> 01:25.818
Hi, Bev.
(laughing)

01:25.820 --> 01:29.254
Oh, come on. You don't kiss
an Italian mama on the cheek.

01:29.256 --> 01:31.190
The lips-- we want the lips.
Oh, okay.

01:31.192 --> 01:33.125
Ah, look at your wife.

01:33.127 --> 01:35.160
She gets prettier every
day, like that actress.

01:35.162 --> 01:37.196
Bev, what's her name?
From the movies.

01:37.198 --> 01:39.298
Catherine Zeta Jones.
No, the one with teeth.

01:39.300 --> 01:41.200
They all have teeth.

01:41.202 --> 01:43.102
Uh, Julia Roberts!

01:43.104 --> 01:44.570
You look just like
Julia Roberts.

01:44.572 --> 01:47.339
Oh, come on.
(scoffs)

01:47.341 --> 01:49.475
You know, maybe a little.

01:49.477 --> 01:51.410
And you.

01:51.412 --> 01:53.479
Well, you're doing
the best you can.

01:53.481 --> 01:57.116
But you really punched
above your weight with this one.

01:57.118 --> 01:59.485
So, uh, what are you guys
doing back in Pittsburgh?

01:59.487 --> 02:01.220
It's just a pit stop
on our way

02:01.222 --> 02:03.122
to see the world's
largest Hershey bar.

02:03.124 --> 02:05.257
It's as big as a table.

02:05.259 --> 02:07.259
A small table.
Yeah.

02:07.261 --> 02:11.263
Or a large book, but we still
want to see it for some reason.

02:11.265 --> 02:12.764
Oh, and Dad's back
needed a rest.

02:12.766 --> 02:15.267
Those roads are
full of potholes.
Yeah.

02:15.269 --> 02:18.470
Thanks, Obama.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.206
Oh, by the way, your mailbox
jumped out in front of me

02:21.208 --> 02:22.541
on the way in.
It didn't make it.

02:27.481 --> 02:29.181
Did you bring us any presents?

02:29.183 --> 02:31.283
Of course we did.
You got the bag, Bev.

02:31.285 --> 02:33.285
Ooh, let's see.

02:33.287 --> 02:36.522
For Teddy, take a look at this.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.223
ADAM:
Oh, I had

02:38.225 --> 02:40.359
one of those, Teddy.
It's a switchblade comb.

02:41.362 --> 02:44.763
Or just a switchblade.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.665
Wow! Thanks!

02:46.667 --> 02:47.833
Wow!

02:47.835 --> 02:49.168
Thanks!

02:49.170 --> 02:51.170
Yeah, a knife for my son

02:51.172 --> 02:54.239
who cut himself
on a Hula-Hoop.

02:54.241 --> 02:58.277
And, Kate, how about
some genuine Kentucky fireworks?

02:58.279 --> 02:59.745
(laughs)

03:01.215 --> 03:02.781
Whoa, these are bottle rockets!
Mm.

03:02.783 --> 03:05.350
It's about to get real, Teddy.

03:05.352 --> 03:07.519
We haven't forgotten
about you, Peanut.

03:07.521 --> 03:09.288
Oh!
Bring him out, Bev.

03:09.290 --> 03:10.689
Him?

03:10.691 --> 03:12.224
Mm-hmm.

03:12.226 --> 03:13.792
A turtle. Yay!

03:13.794 --> 03:15.394
Yeah, that's
an endangered tortoise

03:15.396 --> 03:17.229
we found on the side
of the road.

03:17.231 --> 03:20.232
It was hard to get that little
electronic tag off it,

03:20.234 --> 03:22.668
but luckily, we had
Teddy's switchblade.

03:24.371 --> 03:25.737
Okay, why don't you
guys run upstairs,

03:25.739 --> 03:27.339
and Mommy and I will

03:27.341 --> 03:29.441
donate these
to needy criminal children.

03:29.443 --> 03:31.310
Your parents are
a couple of squares!

03:32.880 --> 03:35.280
Mom! Dad!

03:35.282 --> 03:38.250
Oh, who is
this handsome guy?

03:38.252 --> 03:40.452
Is it Tom Selleck or my son?

03:40.454 --> 03:42.387
It's me! It's Don!

03:42.389 --> 03:43.622
(laughs)

03:43.624 --> 03:45.290
Tom Selleck?

03:45.292 --> 03:47.626
I've eaten Cheetos that
look more like Tom Selleck.

03:47.628 --> 03:49.261
They think I look
like Julia Roberts.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.629
(groans)

03:50.631 --> 03:53.599
Joe, Bev, so great
that you're back!

03:53.601 --> 03:55.367
Oh, well, don't worry.

03:55.369 --> 03:56.468
We won't be expecting
to stay at your house.

03:56.470 --> 03:57.836
We know you like
your privacy.

03:57.838 --> 04:00.472
Oh, Bev,
that was almost 20 years ago.

04:00.474 --> 04:02.341
Was it? Wow.

04:02.343 --> 04:04.243
Seems like yesterday.

04:04.245 --> 04:06.912
Joe, do you remember when
Marcy put us up in a hotel

04:06.914 --> 04:08.747
instead of letting
us stay with them?

04:08.749 --> 04:10.315
Like it was yesterday.
See?

04:11.418 --> 04:12.584
So how's the road trip going?

04:12.586 --> 04:14.353
Have a seat.
Oh.

04:14.355 --> 04:15.988
Culturally speaking, it's
been quite an education.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.389
Yeah.

04:17.391 --> 04:18.890
We have seen some things.
Oh.

04:18.892 --> 04:22.427
We stopped
at a gas station in Arizona.

04:22.429 --> 04:24.930
They got five different
flavors of jerky.
Hmm.

04:24.932 --> 04:27.399
You just don't see that
on the East Coast.
No.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.867
No. They even had teriyaki.

04:28.869 --> 04:30.869
Very exotic.
Yeah.

04:30.871 --> 04:34.373
You know, all jerky's made
in China now, right?

04:34.375 --> 04:36.708
Uh, no, I wasn't aware of that.
BEV: Mm-hmm.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.310
Yeah, they're just
rubbing it in our faces

04:38.312 --> 04:41.513
with this teriyaki stuff.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.282
So, what's new
around here?

04:43.284 --> 04:44.516
Oh, well, um,
Adam's got some

04:44.518 --> 04:46.618
fun news to tell you about,
right, honey?

04:46.620 --> 04:47.619
No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

04:47.621 --> 04:49.288
Yes, you do.
No, I don't.

04:49.290 --> 04:50.422
No, I don't. No, I don't.
Yes, you do.

04:50.424 --> 04:52.291
I will keep going.
Oh. Fine.

04:53.594 --> 04:56.695
Uh, yeah, uh, Andi has gone
back to work at the lab,

04:56.697 --> 04:59.631
so I'm taking care of the
kids after school and stuff.

04:59.633 --> 05:01.300
You're taking care
of the kids?

05:01.302 --> 05:02.601
Like a nanny?

05:02.603 --> 05:03.835
(chuckles)

05:03.837 --> 05:05.871
No, like a father.

05:05.873 --> 05:07.306
If the father's a nanny.

05:07.308 --> 05:08.707
(laughter)

05:08.709 --> 05:11.376
You got the looks
and the funny.

05:11.378 --> 05:12.811
BEV:
Well, why shouldn't

05:12.813 --> 05:15.380
the man watch the kids
and the woman work?

05:15.382 --> 05:17.849
I mean, I'm a woman,
and I'm many things.

05:17.851 --> 05:20.852
A wife, a mother,
a tender lover.

05:20.854 --> 05:22.521
No. No. No, no. No.

05:22.523 --> 05:26.024
I think what you two are doing
is very modern.

05:26.026 --> 05:28.994
Andi, I'm proud of you.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.362
Oh. Thanks, Bev.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.530
You're like a daughter to me.

05:31.532 --> 05:32.431
Oh.

05:32.433 --> 05:34.733
My one daughter.

05:34.735 --> 05:36.802
Come on, Bev.
You've got two daughters.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.036
Thank you, Joe.

05:38.038 --> 05:40.405
I meant Adam now that
he's watching the kids.

05:42.343 --> 05:44.443
You see what happens
when I tell him stuff, huh?!

05:44.445 --> 05:47.512
Okay, honey, relax, okay?

05:47.514 --> 05:49.348
I mean, in a few days, they'll
be off to see the world's

05:49.350 --> 05:51.416
slightly-larger-than-average
chocolate bar.

05:51.418 --> 05:52.651
It'll be...
(mutters)

05:52.653 --> 05:55.354
Uh, we were talking.
We're thinking we might

05:55.356 --> 05:56.855
stop our road trip.

05:56.857 --> 05:59.358
Uh-oh.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.493
To stay and help
with the kids.

06:01.495 --> 06:04.529
Yeah. We just want you
to have your dignity back.

06:04.531 --> 06:06.431
But you guys sold your house.

06:06.433 --> 06:08.100
You don't have
any place to live.

06:08.102 --> 06:09.601
We've got the RV.

06:09.603 --> 06:12.571
We can live right
in your driveway!

06:12.573 --> 06:14.906
Our driveway!

06:14.908 --> 06:18.677
Andi, they want
to live in our driveway.

06:18.679 --> 06:20.812
I heard them.

06:20.814 --> 06:22.447
Yeah, we just have
to work out a few kinks

06:22.449 --> 06:24.983
with the septic runoff,
and we'll be good to go.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.555
¶ ¶

06:41.869 --> 06:43.535
Oh, Ma, this cannoli's great.

06:43.537 --> 06:45.871
You keep feeding me like this,
I'm gonna get fat.

06:45.873 --> 06:48.106
Oh, not you.
You're skin and bone.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.942
Oh. You're a good mother.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.778
Now, what's different?

06:52.780 --> 06:54.980
I had to use different lard.

06:54.982 --> 06:57.949
The company I liked
went out of business.

06:57.951 --> 07:01.086
Thanks, Obama.

07:01.088 --> 07:03.021
Dad, he's not even president
anymore.

07:03.023 --> 07:04.689
He knows what he did.

07:05.726 --> 07:07.626
So,

07:07.628 --> 07:09.528
have you two thought
about our offer?

07:10.731 --> 07:12.030
Uh...

07:12.032 --> 07:13.632
Oh, you know what?

07:13.634 --> 07:15.534
We don't want to take
advantage of you.

07:15.536 --> 07:17.102
I mean, what about
the rest of your trip?

07:17.104 --> 07:19.638
Seeing the country after
Joe retired was your dream.

07:19.640 --> 07:22.007
Five months in that box
on wheels is plenty.

07:23.577 --> 07:24.843
The shower is so small,

07:24.845 --> 07:27.479
you can't even wash
both sides of you.

07:27.481 --> 07:29.881
You got to pick one--
the front or the back.

07:29.883 --> 07:31.650
It's a real Sophie's Choice.

07:32.786 --> 07:34.586
Yeah, but you guys
got better things

07:34.588 --> 07:35.754
to do than hang
around here.

07:35.756 --> 07:36.922
You should be out
with your friends,

07:36.924 --> 07:38.490
talking about the good old days

07:38.492 --> 07:40.625
before the wheel was invented.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.794
Hmm. Our friends
are either dead,

07:42.796 --> 07:44.963
or living in one
of those old folks homes.

07:44.965 --> 07:47.599
We visited a few
on our swing through Florida.

07:47.601 --> 07:50.602
Yeah, it's where you go to die.

07:50.604 --> 07:54.906
One place we went-- they sold
caskets right in the lobby.

07:54.908 --> 07:56.641
Honey, I think
those were planters.

07:56.643 --> 07:58.009
People planters!

07:59.780 --> 08:00.979
I liked that place.

08:00.981 --> 08:02.614
One night in the dining hall,

08:02.616 --> 08:05.517
I watched this Cuban man
eat a baked potato.

08:05.519 --> 08:08.887
It was just fascinating.

08:08.889 --> 08:12.123
Ma, why do you have
to say the guy was Cuban?

08:12.125 --> 08:14.493
He was Cuban.
It makes a good story.

08:14.495 --> 08:17.162
I mean, if I just say
a man's eating a potato,

08:17.164 --> 08:18.964
I got nothing, snoozefest.

08:18.966 --> 08:21.032
So what do you say?

08:21.034 --> 08:23.802
Are we living
in your driveway or not?

08:26.139 --> 08:29.641
Uh...

08:31.879 --> 08:34.546
Yes, great. Please stay.

08:34.548 --> 08:35.947
Oh, great! Hooray.

08:35.949 --> 08:37.849
Oh, it's gonna be wonderful!
Oh, yes.

08:37.851 --> 08:40.952
Adam and I are gonna be talking
about how wonderful this is

08:40.954 --> 08:42.521
long, long into the night.

08:44.191 --> 08:47.792
"Yes, great.
Please stay."

08:47.794 --> 08:50.161
What was I supposed to say,
honey? They're my parents.

08:50.163 --> 08:53.765
And, you know, this could
actually be really great timing.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.000
Don and I have
that mini mall job.

08:55.002 --> 08:57.569
We're a lot busier.
I could use the help.

08:57.571 --> 08:59.237
Honey, you know
I love your parents,

08:59.239 --> 09:02.707
but they're just not the moral
compass I want for our kids.

09:02.709 --> 09:05.944
I mean, those cannolis
were not Obama's fault.

09:05.946 --> 09:09.648
Well, that stuff goes
right over the kids' heads.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.650
Okay, can we at least
give it a trial run?

09:11.652 --> 09:13.151
How bad could it be?

09:13.153 --> 09:16.688
Well, I think the
<i> Titanic</i> was a trial run.

09:16.690 --> 09:19.257
Come on. They know
how to raise kids.

09:19.259 --> 09:22.327
They raised me,
and I'm fantastic.

09:22.329 --> 09:24.663
Well, you're humble.
I'll give you that.

09:24.665 --> 09:26.665
Look, I will talk to them,

09:26.667 --> 09:28.733
and make sure
they do everything the way I do.

09:28.735 --> 09:31.570
Oh, the way we do.
The way you do.

09:31.572 --> 09:35.674
All right, fine. I'll
give you your trial run.

09:35.676 --> 09:38.944
It's what Julia
Roberts would do.

09:40.881 --> 09:42.981
JOE:
<i> All right!</i>

09:42.983 --> 09:44.282
Bye, Grandma.
Oh, I love you so much.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.685
(overlapping chatter)
All right, bye.

09:46.687 --> 09:48.353
Bye-bye.
Okay, listen.

09:48.355 --> 09:50.021
Meet the kids here
at 3:00 sharp,

09:50.023 --> 09:51.890
and give 'em a snack, or
they turn into maniacs.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.025
But not candy,
or they turn into maniacs.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.361
And make 'em start on
their homework right away,

09:56.363 --> 09:58.863
or they'll just run
around like maniacs.

09:58.865 --> 10:00.865
Basically, they're maniacs.

10:00.867 --> 10:03.168
And I can't believe
I have to say this,

10:03.170 --> 10:06.371
but no weapons
and no explosives.

10:06.373 --> 10:10.041
Relax. We raised you,
and you turned out fantastic.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.143
That's what I said!

10:12.145 --> 10:14.346
All right, keep it
moving, Burns. Let's go.

10:14.348 --> 10:16.014
Oh. Who are these
youngsters?

10:16.016 --> 10:17.716
ADAM: Oh, uh, my parents,
Bev and Joe.

10:17.718 --> 10:21.086
Mom, Dad, this is, uh,
Emme's teacher, Mrs. Rodriguez.

10:21.088 --> 10:23.154
Ooh, Rodriguez!

10:23.156 --> 10:24.055
Mom.

10:24.057 --> 10:25.757
Are you from Mexico?

10:25.759 --> 10:27.692
Actually, I'm from
Philadelphia.

10:27.694 --> 10:30.795
Oh, fascinating.
Now, do you eat baked potatoes?

10:30.797 --> 10:32.230
Okay, okay! Okay, Emme,
why don't you show Grandma

10:32.232 --> 10:33.999
and Grandpa
your classroom, hmm?

10:34.001 --> 10:37.002
Aw, yeah. He's gonna
apologize for us now.

10:37.004 --> 10:38.770
He's gotten real uptight.

10:38.772 --> 10:41.039
Must be all that
cooking and cleaning.

10:41.041 --> 10:43.074
A lot of housewives
get like that.

10:44.044 --> 10:46.277
Sorry.

10:46.279 --> 10:48.813
For what? I'm Latina,
and they were being nice.

10:48.815 --> 10:50.982
You've never once asked me
where I'm from.

10:50.984 --> 10:54.352
Yes, but, to be fair,
I don't care.

10:54.354 --> 10:56.921
Mm-hmm. It's all coming
out now, isn't it, Burns?
That's right.

10:56.923 --> 10:58.173
Three more months of school

10:58.174 --> 10:59.424
and we never have
to see each other again.

10:59.426 --> 11:01.826
More importantly,
I never have to see you again.

11:01.828 --> 11:03.828
Believe it or not,
I'm gonna miss you.

11:03.830 --> 11:07.098
I don't get a lot of wins.
But with you, I always win.

11:07.100 --> 11:08.299
(both chuckle)

11:08.301 --> 11:10.669
What a fun classroom.

11:10.671 --> 11:12.303
Like a fiesta, right?
(chuckles)

11:12.305 --> 11:14.039
That's mostly
your son's doing.

11:14.041 --> 11:16.274
He's room mom this year.

11:16.276 --> 11:18.810
Oh, for the love of God.

11:18.812 --> 11:21.146
(laughs, mutters)

11:21.148 --> 11:22.681
All right, let's go.

11:22.683 --> 11:23.915
Adios!

11:23.917 --> 11:25.450
Ma!

11:27.821 --> 11:29.054
Hey.

11:29.056 --> 11:30.388
Hey, cuties, we're home.

11:30.390 --> 11:32.123
(dramatic music playing on TV)

11:33.093 --> 11:34.225
What are you watching?

11:34.227 --> 11:36.161
<i> Extreme Autopsy.</i>

11:37.230 --> 11:38.697
They chop up dead bodies.

11:38.699 --> 11:40.198
Grandpa Joe found it.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.367
Here we go, he's
getting the bone saw.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.303
He won't need it. That body
was in the lake for weeks.

11:45.305 --> 11:48.106
No, no, no, no, no, no!

11:48.108 --> 11:50.075
EMME/KATE/TEDDY:
Aw.

11:50.077 --> 11:51.910
(scoffs)
Is your homework done?

11:51.912 --> 11:54.946
Grandma said we were
too cute to do homework.

11:54.948 --> 11:57.015
And is that candy?

11:57.017 --> 11:58.850
We're having candy dinner.

11:58.852 --> 12:03.488
Why don't you ever
give us candy dinner?

12:03.490 --> 12:06.157
No. You know, as bad
as I thought this would be,

12:06.159 --> 12:08.059
it's so much worse.
And I was like,

12:08.061 --> 12:09.327
"What if they do this or
that or the other thing?"

12:09.329 --> 12:10.795
And then they did
all the things.

12:10.797 --> 12:12.063
They did all the things, Adam.

12:12.065 --> 12:13.965
Okay, okay, okay.
I will handle this.

12:13.967 --> 12:16.835
Mom? Dad?

12:16.837 --> 12:19.104
It's just me.

12:19.106 --> 12:22.140
Bev is resting her eyes, and
Joe's down at Dunkin' Donuts,

12:22.142 --> 12:25.110
because
it's his favorite bathroom.

12:25.112 --> 12:27.145
What are you doing here?

12:27.147 --> 12:28.179
I saw them at pick-up and they

12:28.181 --> 12:29.447
couldn't remember
how to get back.

12:29.449 --> 12:30.315
Then your mom
insisted

12:30.317 --> 12:31.416
I eat some veal

12:31.418 --> 12:32.851
to fatten me up.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.119
She said

12:34.121 --> 12:37.188
I couldn't leave
until it's all gone.

12:37.190 --> 12:39.290
I'm the veal now.

12:39.292 --> 12:42.260
Italian mothers
like to feed people.

12:42.262 --> 12:45.063
They also like to kiss
on the mouth, Adam.

12:46.199 --> 12:48.433
Well, kiss her
back next time,

12:48.435 --> 12:51.002
see what happens.
I don't know.

12:51.004 --> 12:52.504
Adam, this is not funny.

12:52.506 --> 12:55.039
Look-look, don't worry,
these are just, you know,

12:55.041 --> 12:56.307
day one growing pains.

12:56.309 --> 12:59.978
There's no more juice boxes.

13:01.014 --> 13:02.547
Thanks, Obama.

13:13.360 --> 13:15.393
One day, one day your
parents watched our kids,

13:15.395 --> 13:17.462
and they turned our little
girl into Bill O'Reilly.

13:19.166 --> 13:21.299
What am I supposed
to do, Andi,

13:21.301 --> 13:22.967
go out to the RV,
knock on the door,

13:22.969 --> 13:24.402
and tell my own parents
to leave?

13:24.404 --> 13:26.805
That's a great idea. Do that.

13:26.807 --> 13:29.040
Oh, okay. If you feel
so strongly about it,

13:29.042 --> 13:30.341
why don't you go out there
and do it.

13:30.343 --> 13:32.377
Well, I can't do it.
They like me.

13:32.379 --> 13:36.347
I mean, you know, they love
you, but they really like me.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.383
Look, I agree.
We got to get 'em out of here,

13:38.385 --> 13:41.319
but I don't want
to hurt their feelings.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.856
I know. I just...
(sighs)

13:44.858 --> 13:47.959
I wish there was someplace else
they could go.

13:47.961 --> 13:50.161
Hey, you know where
they've never stayed?

13:50.163 --> 13:52.163
Huh?
Tom Selleck's house.

13:52.165 --> 13:54.299
Nice.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.434
That's right. It's not a family
until everybody suffers.

13:58.071 --> 13:59.904
So I'm thinking we put
'em in your driveway.

13:59.906 --> 14:01.239
Oh, no way.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.408
Why would I want them here?

14:05.345 --> 14:08.980
Uh, well, because
your invitation to Joe and Bev

14:08.982 --> 14:10.448
will heal the awful breach

14:10.450 --> 14:12.483
that you've been struggling
with for years.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.419
Boom.

14:14.421 --> 14:16.287
I don't want to
heal the breach.

14:16.289 --> 14:19.891
I have enjoyed
19 mother-in-law-free years.

14:19.893 --> 14:22.427
It's like heaven, but you
don't have to be a good person.

14:22.429 --> 14:24.562
ANDI: Okay,
but I-I need them

14:24.564 --> 14:26.097
out of our driveway,
all right?

14:26.099 --> 14:28.233
There's a septic hose
in my rosebushes.

14:28.235 --> 14:30.235
Okay, how about this,
golden boy, huh?

14:30.237 --> 14:32.403
I'll tell Mom and Dad that
you want them to stay here.

14:32.405 --> 14:34.239
Then when they come over
here, you can tell 'em no

14:34.241 --> 14:36.407
to their innocent,
loving faces. Hmm?

14:36.409 --> 14:38.009
They got us, baby.

14:38.011 --> 14:40.011
No, no.

14:40.013 --> 14:41.946
Relax, Big Daddy.

14:41.948 --> 14:43.147
You know what?

14:43.149 --> 14:44.782
Go ahead
and bring them over here.

14:44.783 --> 14:46.416
And I'll just tell them
that you came to us first,

14:46.419 --> 14:48.253
'cause you don't want them
staying at your place.

14:48.255 --> 14:50.655
Fine by me. Let's burn
this whole thing down!

14:50.657 --> 14:52.590
Okay, okay, okay.
Everybody just take...

14:52.592 --> 14:54.292
just take it easy, all right?

14:54.294 --> 14:56.961
I mean, there has
to be a solution.

14:56.963 --> 15:01.132
So, short of faking
our own deaths, what do we do?

15:01.134 --> 15:03.434
Well, my parents live
in a retirement village,

15:03.436 --> 15:04.569
and they love it.

15:04.571 --> 15:07.272
Oh, Dad hates those places.
Well, yeah,

15:07.274 --> 15:09.474
but what if we don't tell him
it's one of those places?

15:09.476 --> 15:12.110
Yeah, we can just bring 'em
there and-and tell 'em

15:12.112 --> 15:13.578
it's a regular apartment
that you guys are looking at

15:13.580 --> 15:15.413
because you're thinking
of downsizing.

15:15.415 --> 15:16.648
ADAM: Yeah. Yeah,
and then by the time

15:16.650 --> 15:18.283
Dad figures out where he is,

15:18.285 --> 15:19.951
he'll love it.
You know,

15:19.953 --> 15:22.120
that could really work.
Those places are fancy now.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.588
And Dad won't be hard to
trick. He still thinks

15:23.590 --> 15:25.990
you voted for Obama
"by accident."

15:29.062 --> 15:30.128
ANDI:
<i> Wow, this is</i>

15:30.130 --> 15:31.562
a nice apartment.
Yeah.

15:31.564 --> 15:34.365
And no sharp corners.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.501
What a warm welcome
from that lady at the gate.

15:36.503 --> 15:37.502
Yeah.

15:37.504 --> 15:39.203
I think she was Vietnamese.

15:39.205 --> 15:41.572
I'd love to watch her eat
a baked potato.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.574
So, Andi, how about
this place, huh?

15:43.576 --> 15:45.610
Psh. Gosh, Don,

15:45.612 --> 15:47.946
you and Marcy
may call this downsizing,

15:47.948 --> 15:50.548
but I-I call it upgradezing.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.717
And no guest room.
You'll like that.

15:52.719 --> 15:54.319
JOE:
I don't know.

15:54.321 --> 15:56.154
There's something
about this place.

15:56.156 --> 15:59.057
Why are there ramps everywhere
instead of stairs?

15:59.059 --> 16:03.594
Oh, uh, that's because ramps
are the stairs of the future.

16:03.596 --> 16:05.997
Yeah, yeah. That's right.
I mean, in a few years,

16:05.999 --> 16:07.532
you're only gonna see stairs
in a museum.

16:07.534 --> 16:10.401
A-And not to walk on,
just to look at.

16:10.403 --> 16:12.537
Eventually,
people will be born

16:12.539 --> 16:14.539
without the ability
to climb steps.

16:14.541 --> 16:16.541
Nature has no stairs.

16:16.543 --> 16:20.378
Mountains are
nature's ramps to the sky.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.614
Or steps, if you will.

16:23.616 --> 16:26.517
That doesn't make any sense.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.519
So, I read in the
lobby that they have

16:28.521 --> 16:30.688
bingo, musicals, comedy nights.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.690
Oh, and there's a restaurant
that serves dinner

16:32.692 --> 16:34.559
from 2:00 to 4:00 p.m.

16:34.561 --> 16:36.561
I know that's when
I like to eat.

16:36.563 --> 16:38.162
BEV:
That sounds fun.

16:38.164 --> 16:41.165
Call me crazy but, Joe,

16:41.167 --> 16:44.335
I-I'm thinking this place
could be good for us.

16:44.337 --> 16:46.337
For you? Wow, Ma.

16:46.339 --> 16:48.506
That never occurred to us.

16:48.508 --> 16:49.674
JOE:
Yeah, yeah, it's not bad.

16:49.676 --> 16:51.743
Oh, here's a brochure.

16:51.745 --> 16:53.611
Oh, no, no, no! Don't read that!
That's full of lies.

16:53.613 --> 16:55.546
It's made in China.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.582
"Here at the Oaks we welcome
all levels of clients.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.118
"A Level-- full independence.

17:00.120 --> 17:02.086
"B Level--
targeted support.

17:02.088 --> 17:04.188
C Level-- live-in staff."

17:04.190 --> 17:05.089
And then

17:05.091 --> 17:06.424
D Level.

17:06.426 --> 17:07.625
What's D Level?

17:07.627 --> 17:11.562
It's just a picture
of a tree in a field.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.731
This is an old folks' home!

17:13.733 --> 17:17.668
ANDI/DON/ADAM/MARCY:
What?!

17:17.670 --> 17:20.705
Why would Don and Marcy want
to live in an old folks' home?

17:20.707 --> 17:22.540
Well, it's not for them--
it's for us.

17:22.542 --> 17:24.609
They used it as a trick
to get us out here.

17:24.611 --> 17:26.611
They want us out
of the house,

17:26.613 --> 17:29.647
but they're just
too chicken to tell us.

17:29.649 --> 17:32.517
Well, that was not very
nice at all, Marcy.

17:34.187 --> 17:37.155
Uh, which chair would you
like me to die in, huh?

17:37.157 --> 17:39.190
This one or that one
or this one, right?

17:39.192 --> 17:41.459
That's the great thing
about this place--

17:41.461 --> 17:44.629
there are so many options.

17:47.167 --> 17:50.334
If you wanted us to go, you
should've just told us to go!

17:50.336 --> 17:51.669
I didn't want
to upset you. You know,

17:51.671 --> 17:54.338
more than you are usually.

17:54.340 --> 17:57.141
Look, it's hard
to tell you stuff, all right?

17:57.143 --> 17:58.709
I told you Andi went back
to work,

17:58.711 --> 17:59.677
and you gave me a hard time.

17:59.679 --> 18:01.646
Marcy was honest

18:01.648 --> 18:04.515
and said she didn't want you
to stay with her 19 years ago,

18:04.517 --> 18:05.850
and you're still mad at her.

18:05.852 --> 18:07.752
That's not true.
Well, it is true,

18:07.754 --> 18:09.420
but I don't like
the way you said it.

18:09.422 --> 18:11.856
Okay, look, it's just...

18:11.858 --> 18:13.691
you know, living
in our driveway,

18:13.693 --> 18:16.394
showing our kids autopsies,

18:16.396 --> 18:17.728
stealing turtles

18:17.730 --> 18:19.730
from the side of the road.

18:19.732 --> 18:22.133
It's-it's a lot to take.

18:22.135 --> 18:24.669
I'm fine with it.
It's just Adam.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.875
You got something to say,
say it.

18:30.877 --> 18:32.577
Yeah, Adam. Say it.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.112
(chuckling):
Oh...

18:34.114 --> 18:35.746
Fine. Okay.

18:35.748 --> 18:38.449
Here it is.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.752
I love you, but you got to
find your own place to live.

18:41.754 --> 18:42.887
Okay.

18:42.889 --> 18:45.656
Wha--? That's it? Okay?

18:45.658 --> 18:48.693
We haven't really enjoyed
our time here anyway.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.661
What?

18:50.663 --> 18:52.196
You make too many rules.

18:52.198 --> 18:53.831
We can't tell
stories like we like

18:53.833 --> 18:55.800
or watch the TV
shows we like.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.268
Or pick up a turtle

18:57.270 --> 18:59.470
that technically belongs
to any American.

18:59.472 --> 19:01.539
My taxes

19:01.540 --> 19:03.607
have bought me at least one
stinkin' street turtle.

19:03.610 --> 19:04.742
So we'll go.

19:04.744 --> 19:07.545
And-and you're not mad?

19:07.547 --> 19:08.630
Are you mad?

19:08.631 --> 19:09.714
Not if you're not mad.

19:09.716 --> 19:11.382
Just the usual mad.

19:11.384 --> 19:15.219
Nobody could stay mad
at our sweet boy.

19:15.221 --> 19:17.688
He's so handsome, just like...

19:17.690 --> 19:19.557
Oh. Who-who is it, Joe?

19:19.559 --> 19:20.791
Larry King?
No.

19:20.793 --> 19:22.860
No. The actor.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.362
Don Rickles?

19:24.364 --> 19:26.797
No, the actor.
With the hair?

19:26.799 --> 19:27.665
Oh, they all have hair.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.200
Not Telly Savalas.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.668
Oh, he was good.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.670
Yul Brynner was a
good bald guy, too.

19:32.672 --> 19:36.207
Oh. If only the two of them
had been in a movie together.

19:36.209 --> 19:37.608
JOE: You can't do
that. From behind,

19:37.610 --> 19:39.944
you can't tell
who's talking.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.783
Promise me
I will never get like that.

19:45.785 --> 19:47.785
Oh, you're gonna be
exactly like that.
(groans)

19:47.787 --> 19:50.588
But I will love it.

19:50.590 --> 19:52.924
You know who won't love it?
Our kids.

19:52.926 --> 19:54.759
(chuckles) Yeah.
We're gonna get their kids

19:54.761 --> 19:57.228
all kinds of crazy gifts.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.463
Tasers, an iguana,

19:59.465 --> 20:01.399
a wood chipper.

20:01.401 --> 20:03.968
Hey, that reminds me,

20:03.970 --> 20:05.836
what did you do
with that turtle?

20:05.838 --> 20:07.838
Oh, I dropped him off at the zoo
with a Post-it on its back

20:07.840 --> 20:09.607
that said, "Thanks, Obama."

20:09.609 --> 20:10.942
(chuckles)

20:18.585 --> 20:19.817
Hey, Ma. What's going on?
You're packing up?

20:19.819 --> 20:20.885
We found an apartment.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.687
Your dad's inside

20:22.688 --> 20:24.488
right now signing the lease
with the landlady.

20:24.490 --> 20:27.792
That's great! Uh,
I think those are our towels.

20:27.794 --> 20:29.994
You kick us out, I take towels.

20:31.931 --> 20:34.532
That's worth it.

20:37.670 --> 20:40.304
Hello, Burns.

20:40.306 --> 20:42.607
What?

20:42.609 --> 20:45.243
See? Look at his face. I told
you it'd be funny. (chuckles)

20:46.012 --> 20:47.912
You're moving in with her?

20:47.914 --> 20:49.947
She's renting us the
other half of her duplex.

20:49.949 --> 20:50.948
(door opens)

20:50.950 --> 20:53.384
Ma, why didn't you tell me

20:53.386 --> 20:54.819
she was your new landlady?

20:54.821 --> 20:57.955
You never like me to
describe anyone in my stories.
