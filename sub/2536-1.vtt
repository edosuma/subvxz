00:34.720 --> 00:36.404
<i>Metal screams.</i>

00:38.600 --> 00:40.841
<i>Something hits me square in the chest.</i>

00:41.680 --> 00:43.569
<i>There's no up or down.</i>

00:43.720 --> 00:45.370
<i>I don't weigh a thing.</i>

00:48.880 --> 00:50.962
<i>I don't remember a thing.</i>

00:54.720 --> 00:56.768
<i>This doesn't look good at all.</i>

00:56.920 --> 00:59.207
<i>I've gone and done something again.</i>

00:59.360 --> 01:01.647
<i>Wish I could remember what.</i>

01:01.800 --> 01:03.165
<i>How did I get here?</i>

01:03.320 --> 01:06.051
<i>What have I done? And why?</i>

01:06.200 --> 01:07.804
<i>I must've forgotten my medicine.</i>

01:08.000 --> 01:10.048
<i>I've got a condition.</i>

01:10.200 --> 01:14.250
<i>It's bad to forget your medicine
when you've got a condition.</i>

01:14.400 --> 01:16.164
<i>Caught myself a bullet.</i>

01:16.320 --> 01:19.403
<i>The wound's fresh,
maybe an hour old.</i>

01:19.600 --> 01:21.090
<i>I can't remember how I got it.</i>

01:23.000 --> 01:25.685
<i>For the life of me,
I can't remember.</i>

01:28.800 --> 01:30.802
<i>The projects.</i>

01:30.960 --> 01:32.564
<i>Ugly as ever.</i>

01:32.720 --> 01:34.961
<i>What the hell am I doing here?</i>

01:35.120 --> 01:37.009
<i>Put the pieces together.</i>

01:37.200 --> 01:38.770
<i>Remember.</i>

01:40.320 --> 01:43.051
<i>It's Saturday,
so I must've started the night</i>

01:43.200 --> 01:44.611
<i>at Kadie's joint.</i>

01:44.760 --> 01:47.127
<i>Just another Saturday night.</i>

01:47.280 --> 01:49.123
<i>Me and all the other losers like me</i>

01:49.280 --> 01:53.285
<i>sucking back the sauce
and drooling like fools over Nancy.</i>

01:53.880 --> 01:55.291
<i>I was in a mood.</i>

01:55.440 --> 01:57.761
<i>Even watching Nancy
couldn't cheer me up.</i>

01:57.920 --> 02:00.048
<i>I get that way sometimes.</i>

02:00.200 --> 02:04.091
<i>Empty in the gut,
hollow in that lonely place,</i>

02:04.240 --> 02:07.881
<i>and wishing I had an excuse
to break somebody's face.</i>

02:10.919 --> 02:13.161
<i>It was just another Saturday night.</i>

02:14.600 --> 02:17.843
<i>I was wondering what I was
gonna do with myself</i>

02:18.000 --> 02:19.843
<i>when I smelled something awful.</i>

02:21.360 --> 02:22.930
<i>Burning hair.</i>

02:25.520 --> 02:27.124
<i>Burning meat.</i>

02:29.160 --> 02:32.482
<i>Like these poor old winos
didn't have it bad enough already.</i>

02:32.640 --> 02:34.529
<i>Damn frat boys.</i>

02:34.680 --> 02:37.331
<i>Damn rich, spoiled brats.</i>

02:40.440 --> 02:41.885
Leave him be.

02:42.040 --> 02:44.281
Crawl back into your bottle,
Bernini boy.

02:47.240 --> 02:48.890
<i>Why did he call me Bernie?</i>

02:49.680 --> 02:51.682
<i>At least I know they're bad guys.</i>

02:51.840 --> 02:54.161
<i>Nothing wrong with killing
the bunch of them.</i>

02:54.360 --> 02:57.204
<i>Hell, it's practically my civic duty.</i>

02:59.360 --> 03:01.931
<i>Oh, these wormy little twits.</i>

03:02.080 --> 03:03.411
<i>I hate these guys.</i>

03:03.560 --> 03:05.210
God, this really hurts.

03:07.520 --> 03:09.124
<i>They made a run for it.</i>

03:09.280 --> 03:11.806
<i>I did what any good citizen would do.</i>

03:15.360 --> 03:16.486
Go to hell.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.291
What the hell?

03:20.600 --> 03:21.840
What the hell?

03:23.280 --> 03:24.361
What the hell!

03:28.720 --> 03:31.007
<i>That's when I got my idea.</i>

03:31.160 --> 03:34.323
<i>If they got back to their university
out in Sacred Oaks,</i>

03:34.520 --> 03:36.249
<i>I'd never catch them.</i>

03:36.440 --> 03:39.171
<i>I banged them around
like a hockey puck.</i>

03:39.360 --> 03:42.443
<i>Cut them off at every turn.</i>

03:42.600 --> 03:45.171
<i>I left them no choice
but to head over the hill</i>

03:45.320 --> 03:46.810
<i>to the projects.</i>

03:46.960 --> 03:49.531
<i>I could just turn my back
and leave them here.</i>

03:49.680 --> 03:53.002
<i>My old neighbors
would take care of them but good.</i>

03:53.160 --> 03:56.289
<i>But hell, why should they have
all the fun?</i>

04:05.160 --> 04:06.810
<i>The projects.</i>

04:08.000 --> 04:10.048
<i>I was born here.</i>

04:10.920 --> 04:12.729
<i>My old neighborhood.</i>

04:14.160 --> 04:15.161
Damn.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.367
He's a dead man.

04:16.519 --> 04:17.726
I'm telling you,

04:17.880 --> 04:19.848
I'm one bitch of a good shot,

04:20.000 --> 04:21.524
and he's a dead man.

04:24.800 --> 04:26.529
<i>My old neighbors.</i>

04:26.680 --> 04:28.842
<i>They let me know they're watching.</i>

04:29.440 --> 04:31.249
<i>I remind them who I am.</i>

04:31.840 --> 04:33.569
I tell them what to do.

04:42.240 --> 04:43.526
No! No, please!

04:43.720 --> 04:44.607
Please, I...

04:44.800 --> 04:45.722
I've got money.

04:45.880 --> 04:46.847
I've got a trust fund.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.081
I can pay.

04:48.240 --> 04:49.685
You'll pay.

04:57.480 --> 04:58.606
Hey.

04:59.680 --> 05:01.921
Before, when you shot me,
you called me Bernie.

05:02.080 --> 05:03.764
Why did you call me Bernie?

05:03.920 --> 05:05.126
Bernini.

05:05.320 --> 05:06.845
It's a brand name.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.729
That coat you're wearing.

05:08.880 --> 05:10.211
It's a Bernini.

05:10.360 --> 05:12.249
Really? Oh.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.689
Thanks for clearing that up, kid.

05:16.320 --> 05:17.481
Knife!

05:22.280 --> 05:23.884
<i>Bernini, huh?</i>

05:24.040 --> 05:26.122
<i>And one fine coat it is.</i>

05:26.280 --> 05:28.442
<i>Somebody must've spent
a fortune on it.</i>

05:29.560 --> 05:31.289
<i>I wonder who.</i>

05:31.440 --> 05:32.930
<i>And while I'm at it,</i>

05:33.840 --> 05:36.161
<i>where the heck
did I get these gloves?</i>

05:37.240 --> 05:40.164
<i>I can't remember for the life of me.</i>

07:11.400 --> 07:12.811
Poker.

07:14.240 --> 07:17.722
Savage power in gentleman's hands.

07:19.760 --> 07:21.410
It's a good game.

07:22.240 --> 07:25.881
Now, who wants to play?

07:30.240 --> 07:33.164
<i>Sin City's where you go in
with your eyes open...</i>

07:34.680 --> 07:37.126
<i>Or you don't come out at all.</i>

07:38.680 --> 07:41.365
<i>But a city's like a woman or a casino.</i>

07:42.200 --> 07:44.123
<i>Somebody's gonna win,</i>

07:44.720 --> 07:46.051
<i>and it's gonna be me.</i>

07:49.440 --> 07:50.521
<i>It's the kind of place</i>

07:50.680 --> 07:52.489
<i>your father doesn't want
to talk about.</i>

07:54.400 --> 07:56.721
<i>But where I come from,</i>

07:57.160 --> 08:00.448
<i>a father is a thing
no one seems to be able to find.</i>

08:12.240 --> 08:13.526
<i>I was feeling lucky.</i>

08:14.120 --> 08:16.361
<i>I'd won money in joints all over town,</i>

08:16.520 --> 08:18.363
<i>and I finally made it to Kadie's...</i>

08:20.560 --> 08:22.642
<i>where the real score is.</i>

08:24.920 --> 08:26.968
What happened to the show?

08:41.640 --> 08:43.005
How's tricks, stranger?

08:43.520 --> 08:44.567
Heads or tails?

08:44.720 --> 08:46.085
Heads.

08:46.480 --> 08:47.766
That's a trick.

08:48.160 --> 08:49.844
That won't get you anywhere.

08:57.720 --> 08:59.290
Follow the shiny object.

09:08.040 --> 09:09.485
Where'd you come from, handsome?

09:09.640 --> 09:11.324
Do me a favor and blow on this.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.291
Does Lady Luck have a name?

09:14.440 --> 09:15.566
Marcie.

09:25.000 --> 09:27.128
- Lucky man.
- Every time, ma'am.

09:27.280 --> 09:28.455
Now where's the real action?

09:28.480 --> 09:29.811
Baby, you don't want to know.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.809
I do want to know.

09:31.960 --> 09:33.371
Whatever you say, boss.

09:33.520 --> 09:35.602
Back of the bar. It's your funeral.

09:35.800 --> 09:36.801
They'll eat you alive

09:36.960 --> 09:38.530
- back there.
- I'm a pretty tough chew.

09:38.720 --> 09:39.721
Come on.

09:45.720 --> 09:47.722
Would you kiss it this time?

09:58.280 --> 09:59.281
Oh, my God!

09:59.440 --> 10:00.851
- Hey there, Marcie.
- Yeah?

10:01.000 --> 10:02.490
You want to go make some real money?

10:03.280 --> 10:04.645
Yeah.

10:05.480 --> 10:06.481
I'll check.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.801
I'll bet $100.

10:11.520 --> 10:12.646
Good night.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.161
I'll play.

10:17.160 --> 10:18.207
I'll fold.

10:23.680 --> 10:25.045
Who's the slicker?

10:25.200 --> 10:28.727
I busted this one for craps
over at Josie's once.

10:29.560 --> 10:31.289
He paid up. He's okay.

10:38.120 --> 10:40.248
Whatever you do, kid,
don't win too much.

10:40.400 --> 10:41.526
I never lose.

10:43.920 --> 10:45.445
What's with bringing a frail in here?

10:45.600 --> 10:47.329
This is my good luck charm.

10:47.480 --> 10:49.687
Besides, I'm heading to make
a pretty nice dime tonight.

10:49.840 --> 10:52.047
Got to have someone to spend it on, right?

10:52.200 --> 10:54.965
Sylvio, let our young friend here
do the honors.

11:08.640 --> 11:09.641
Cut.

11:11.040 --> 11:12.530
This boy's good.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.404
Nancy! Nancy!

11:26.560 --> 11:30.360
Nancy! Nancy! Nancy! Nancy!

11:30.520 --> 11:32.284
And the dealer will take two.

11:36.040 --> 11:36.962
One hand in.

11:37.120 --> 11:38.326
I'll play.

11:45.480 --> 11:46.970
I'm out.

11:47.120 --> 11:48.565
Yeah, me, too.

11:54.760 --> 11:55.727
I fold.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.041
I'm done.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.923
How dumb are you feeling now, boy?

12:08.560 --> 12:09.800
Pretty dumb.

12:40.800 --> 12:42.882
Well, Senator, I'm ready for your worst.

12:43.040 --> 12:45.520
Boy, you don't even want
to dream about my worst.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.523
No, I don't imagine I do.

12:47.680 --> 12:49.480
So why don't I just
flatten your ass right now

12:49.600 --> 12:50.931
and we can call it a night.

12:52.480 --> 12:55.723
Sure. This is a fair game,
played by honorable men.

12:55.920 --> 12:57.649
I'm gonna raise you $300.

12:58.960 --> 13:00.325
Easy, kid.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.369
You got any idea
what you're up against?

13:02.520 --> 13:04.204
Looks to me like I'm up against a man.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.771
You're up against a Roark.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.251
Yeah, I was born here, Senator.

13:07.400 --> 13:08.686
I know who you are.

13:09.160 --> 13:11.686
We all die here sooner or later.

13:13.840 --> 13:16.081
I'm gonna raise you another $500.

13:19.080 --> 13:20.411
I like this kid.

13:21.400 --> 13:22.686
I like him a lot.

13:23.200 --> 13:24.361
I'm gonna call you.

13:35.720 --> 13:38.451
You won't be needing anything
for cab fare, will you?

13:40.000 --> 13:43.288
Now that's as fine a hand
as you'll ever have, friend.

13:43.760 --> 13:46.525
You just keep in mind
what hands are made out of.

13:47.080 --> 13:48.161
Will do.

13:49.960 --> 13:51.041
Hey.

13:51.600 --> 13:52.886
Get your ass out of here.

13:53.040 --> 13:55.520
Run like hell,
you might still have a chance.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.444
Oh, I can't miss tomorrow night's game.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.329
Not any more than you can, Officer.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.603
Besides, I already promised Marcie
a night on the town.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.603
I can't protect you.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.444
Then why are you a cop?

14:18.560 --> 14:20.324
Where we going, Johnny?

14:21.600 --> 14:23.170
Everywhere.

15:29.360 --> 15:30.964
<i>One of these days</i>

15:31.120 --> 15:32.406
<i>she'll pull the trigger,</i>

15:32.560 --> 15:34.847
<i>and then there's nothing I can do.</i>

15:35.640 --> 15:37.642
<i>There's nothing I can do now.</i>

15:38.720 --> 15:40.722
<i>And all I can do is ask...</i>

15:41.440 --> 15:43.363
<i>Is don't.</i>

15:43.960 --> 15:46.725
<i>Don't avenge me, Nancy.</i>

15:47.960 --> 15:49.962
<i>It'll be the death of you.</i>

15:51.320 --> 15:52.526
<i>I can't help.</i>

15:54.480 --> 15:56.608
<i>I can't watch.</i>

15:56.760 --> 15:59.331
<i>Death is just like life in Sin City.</i>

16:01.360 --> 16:02.725
<i>There's nothing you can do.</i>

16:04.040 --> 16:06.281
<i>And love doesn't conquer anything at all.</i>

16:07.640 --> 16:09.608
<i>Good luck, Nancy.</i>

16:09.760 --> 16:11.569
<i>Live while you're alive.</i>

16:12.840 --> 16:14.490
<i>Just try, sweetheart.</i>

16:17.400 --> 16:19.528
<i>We make Sin City history.</i>

16:19.720 --> 16:21.563
<i>Hit every hot spot in town.</i>

16:22.120 --> 16:25.602
<i>I blow through almost as much cash
as I make at the tables.</i>

16:27.720 --> 16:29.961
<i>The trouble starts when I try
to use my credit cards.</i>

16:31.280 --> 16:33.009
I'm sure there must be some mistake.

16:33.160 --> 16:35.049
We'd be happy to extend a line of credit.

16:35.200 --> 16:37.320
<i>How can all of them go bad
on the same night?</i>

16:37.440 --> 16:39.920
It's not like you don't have cash.

16:40.080 --> 16:42.287
That's not the point. Come on.

16:43.240 --> 16:44.810
We got to get you home.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.841
<i>Something comes up behind us.</i>

16:52.640 --> 16:54.290
<i>Smells all wrong.</i>

16:56.200 --> 16:58.202
<i>This will slow us down.</i>

16:58.640 --> 17:00.369
You get to the side, Marcie.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.124
I got to break some bones.

17:02.680 --> 17:04.204
What are you talking about, you silly?

17:04.359 --> 17:06.044
You just stay right there.

17:06.200 --> 17:08.280
Gentlemen, listen, I think
I know what this is about,

17:08.400 --> 17:10.686
and I want you to know
you'll have no resistance from me.

17:10.880 --> 17:13.963
That blackjack you got in your hand
could split somebody's skull open.

17:30.880 --> 17:32.160
What the hell was that all about?

17:32.280 --> 17:33.361
You stay out of sight, now.

17:33.520 --> 17:34.806
You'll be safe in Old Town.

17:36.400 --> 17:38.050
Meet me at the Three Sheets Hotel.

17:38.560 --> 17:40.050
Room 166.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.369
One-six... Wait.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.202
Let's get this over with.

18:02.160 --> 18:04.162
Don't enjoy it too much, fellas.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.648
You made a fool of me, boy,

18:11.800 --> 18:13.484
right in front of the wrong people.

18:13.640 --> 18:15.802
You took your chances like we all did,
and you lost.

18:15.960 --> 18:20.284
You have any idea how easy
I kill little snots like you?

18:27.960 --> 18:28.847
Now,

18:29.040 --> 18:31.202
let's see about that winning hand.

18:33.280 --> 18:35.567
Powerful men watch what happens
at that table.

18:36.000 --> 18:39.163
I need them to know the price of defiance.

18:41.840 --> 18:44.081
Power is a fragile thing.

18:44.680 --> 18:46.409
It tolerates no threat.

18:49.840 --> 18:52.684
Defiance must be met with an example

18:53.040 --> 18:55.646
of the wages of defiance.

19:11.360 --> 19:13.362
You'd be smart to kill me now.

19:16.440 --> 19:19.284
I'll do far worse than kill you, boy.

19:38.440 --> 19:42.286
What you have encountered, boy, is power.

19:43.440 --> 19:45.249
Every time the wind blows cold and wet,

19:45.400 --> 19:46.765
that thing that was your hand

19:46.920 --> 19:49.446
will clutch at your leg in arthritic agony.

19:49.600 --> 19:53.002
Whenever it rains, you'll remember me.

19:53.160 --> 19:55.049
You'll remember me

19:55.200 --> 19:57.123
all the time...

19:58.280 --> 19:59.805
My son.

20:01.520 --> 20:02.965
Oh, yeah.

20:03.120 --> 20:04.884
I know who you are.

20:05.040 --> 20:08.886
I knew you were one of mine
the minute I saw you, family resemblance,

20:09.040 --> 20:10.087
my boy.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.651
I don't give a damn.

20:11.800 --> 20:15.168
I only had one real son, Ethan,
may he rest in peace,

20:15.320 --> 20:17.004
and he could've been president.

20:17.160 --> 20:19.527
Did you really think

20:19.680 --> 20:21.409
that I was gonna claim you?

20:28.640 --> 20:30.563
<i>You beat me, Roark.</i>

20:31.920 --> 20:34.002
<i>But when I get back</i>

20:34.680 --> 20:36.648
<i>it'll be a whole different game.</i>

20:45.520 --> 20:47.284
<i>It's another hot night.</i>

20:47.440 --> 20:49.249
<i>Dry and windless.</i>

20:49.400 --> 20:50.811
<i>The kind that makes people</i>

20:50.960 --> 20:53.884
<i>do sweaty, secret things.</i>

20:54.600 --> 20:56.602
<i>Things worth money to me.</i>

20:56.760 --> 20:58.255
This is the last time, Sally.

20:58.280 --> 20:59.964
This has got to be the last time.

21:00.120 --> 21:01.724
You always say that.

21:01.880 --> 21:04.008
I mean it this time.

21:04.200 --> 21:05.326
<i>She glides out of her coat</i>

21:05.480 --> 21:09.007
<i>like it was Christmas wrapping,
playing it for all it's worth.</i>

21:09.560 --> 21:11.369
<i>And it's worth plenty.</i>

21:11.520 --> 21:13.761
- This is the end for us.
- The end for us?

21:13.960 --> 21:15.291
It's my wife.

21:15.440 --> 21:16.840
She's asking all kinds of questions.

21:16.960 --> 21:18.371
She suspects something.

21:18.520 --> 21:21.364
She'll sue and she'll get everything.
Everything!

21:22.800 --> 21:24.848
Everything you've worked so hard for.

21:26.120 --> 21:27.770
I work my butt off.

21:27.920 --> 21:31.003
I built my business up
from out of nothing. Nothing.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.367
Nobody appreciates you, do they, Joey?

21:33.560 --> 21:35.722
Not the way you deserve.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.243
Nobody. Not the employees,
who would be out on the street

21:40.440 --> 21:41.726
if it wasn't for me. Not my wife,

21:41.880 --> 21:44.247
- who I found on the street.
- And she lives in that mansion

21:44.400 --> 21:46.160
- you bought her.
- Wearing all those clothes

21:46.320 --> 21:49.483
that I got her.
With my money, my hard-earned money!

21:49.640 --> 21:51.005
I think you're so strong.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.769
You're damn right about that.

21:54.920 --> 21:56.843
Do I get any credit?

21:57.040 --> 21:59.042
They just take and take and take.

21:59.200 --> 22:01.455
One of these days,
I'm gonna fire the whole pack of 'em.

22:01.480 --> 22:03.289
I'm gonna show them who's boss.

22:03.440 --> 22:04.646
Show me, Joey.

22:04.840 --> 22:06.001
Show me who's boss.

22:06.160 --> 22:07.161
Yeah.

22:07.320 --> 22:08.321
I'll show you.

22:08.480 --> 22:09.845
I'm gonna show you.

22:16.000 --> 22:17.843
<i>Then she's moaning and saying "boss"</i>

22:18.000 --> 22:19.720
- <i>in time with his movements.</i>
- Boss! Bossy!

22:19.840 --> 22:21.569
Bossy! Bossy!

22:22.600 --> 22:24.364
<i>It's all over pretty quickly.</i>

22:26.720 --> 22:28.768
<i>I get everything I need.</i>

22:28.920 --> 22:30.922
<i>The sad thing is,
some of the compositions</i>

22:31.120 --> 22:32.167
<i>are pretty good.</i>

22:32.840 --> 22:34.763
You made me feel like a woman.

22:35.120 --> 22:37.282
I know that sounds corny,
but it's true.

22:37.720 --> 22:39.165
I love you, baby.

22:39.320 --> 22:41.084
You know I love you.

22:41.240 --> 22:43.004
Even when you lie to me.

22:43.320 --> 22:45.049
My wrist hurts, Joey.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.647
You think you can get the key?
It's just in my purse.

22:49.080 --> 22:51.686
You don't have any idea
how much I've sacrificed.

22:51.840 --> 22:53.490
What are you doing, Joey?

22:54.080 --> 22:56.811
It's tearing me up
how much I love you,

22:56.960 --> 22:58.849
and what I got to do.

22:59.680 --> 23:01.409
But I've worked too hard.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.008
And Gloria will get everything.

23:04.400 --> 23:05.811
And I can't let that happen.

23:06.280 --> 23:07.167
No.

23:07.360 --> 23:08.646
I don't have a choice.
It's all her fault.

23:08.800 --> 23:11.963
Joey, please. I...
I won't tell anyone, I swear to God.

23:12.160 --> 23:15.243
I know you won't want to talk.
I know that,

23:15.400 --> 23:17.209
- but you're only human.
- Oh, my aching back.

23:17.360 --> 23:18.735
Gloria's gonna find out about you,

23:18.760 --> 23:20.480
if she doesn't know already,
and she's gonna

23:20.600 --> 23:21.600
offer you a lot of money,

23:21.720 --> 23:22.721
my money! And she's gonna

23:22.920 --> 23:24.649
give it to you to bring me down!

23:24.840 --> 23:27.491
- Then I'll go away.
- Who's gonna pay for the ticket?

23:27.640 --> 23:29.210
The ticket and God knows what else!

23:29.360 --> 23:31.124
Then the apartment! The clothes!

23:31.280 --> 23:32.281
The car!

23:32.440 --> 23:33.851
You're gonna suck me dry,

23:34.000 --> 23:35.001
and you'll never

23:35.160 --> 23:36.286
ever stop!

23:36.640 --> 23:38.290
No. Please, no!

23:44.680 --> 23:45.761
Kill him!

23:45.920 --> 23:48.082
Kill him! Kill him!

23:54.240 --> 23:56.242
Nobody's killing anybody.

23:56.760 --> 23:58.683
Not while I'm around.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.005
Then can I have a ride?

24:09.200 --> 24:11.601
<i>I grab the key and uncuff her.</i>

24:11.800 --> 24:13.848
<i>She gives him a good-bye
that'll still hurt</i>

24:14.000 --> 24:15.764
<i>like hell when he comes to.</i>

24:17.200 --> 24:19.043
<i>I leave the slob handcuffed to the bed</i>

24:19.200 --> 24:20.804
<i>for housekeeping to find.</i>

24:23.040 --> 24:26.362
<i>I take Redondo over the hill
toward Old Town.</i>

24:28.800 --> 24:30.450
Thanks for my life, man.

24:30.600 --> 24:34.286
<i>Sally blends into the sea of flesh
that is Old Town.</i>

24:34.960 --> 24:36.928
<i>They all come back...</i>

24:37.680 --> 24:39.842
<i>The damn Old Town memories.</i>

24:40.040 --> 24:44.489
<i>Drunken mornings and sweaty sex
and stupid, bloody brawls.</i>

24:44.960 --> 24:47.088
<i>And that thing I did.</i>

24:47.240 --> 24:49.083
<i>You can't just pick and choose.</i>

24:49.240 --> 24:51.846
<i>You can't take the good
without the bad.</i>

24:52.000 --> 24:54.401
<i>Not once you let the monster out.</i>

24:54.560 --> 24:56.164
<i>I can't let it out.</i>

24:56.320 --> 24:57.481
<i>Never again.</i>

24:59.800 --> 25:04.328
<i>I drive ten blocks out of my way
and stop for gas I don't need,</i>

25:04.520 --> 25:06.488
<i>avoiding the worst of this job.</i>

25:07.920 --> 25:09.604
<i>My employer...</i>

25:09.960 --> 25:11.610
<i>The wife.</i>

25:11.760 --> 25:15.003
<i>This one's got a lawyer to pay the tab,
so it's easier.</i>

25:15.200 --> 25:17.202
Please leave by the servants' exit.

25:20.440 --> 25:22.442
<i>The Mustang shudders,</i>

25:22.600 --> 25:25.206
<i>begging to cut loose
and show what it can do.</i>

25:26.720 --> 25:29.451
<i>It wants to take me all the way.</i>

25:29.600 --> 25:31.125
<i>I don't let it.</i>

25:32.120 --> 25:35.124
<i>I think about all the ways I've screwed up
and what I'd give</i>

25:35.280 --> 25:38.090
<i>for one clear chance
to wipe the slate clean.</i>

25:39.840 --> 25:43.401
<i>I'd give anything just to cut loose,</i>

25:43.600 --> 25:46.444
<i>just to feel the fire...</i>

25:46.600 --> 25:48.170
<i>One more time.</i>

25:55.440 --> 25:57.090
<i>Never lose control,</i>

25:57.720 --> 25:59.768
<i>not for a second.</i>

25:59.960 --> 26:02.406
<i>Never let the monster out.</i>

26:03.480 --> 26:05.369
<i>Remember when you did.</i>

26:07.120 --> 26:09.202
<i>Remember what you did.</i>

26:25.240 --> 26:26.366
Yeah?

26:26.560 --> 26:28.289
Dwight, is that you?

26:30.120 --> 26:31.087
Ava.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.730
<i>I'm sorry to call.</i>

26:32.880 --> 26:34.769
I know I've got no right.

26:34.920 --> 26:36.524
But I need to see you.

26:36.680 --> 26:38.045
<i>Tonight.</i>

26:39.080 --> 26:41.162
<i>Please, Dwight, don't hang up. Please.</i>

26:41.320 --> 26:43.163
<i>She keeps talking.</i>

26:43.320 --> 26:45.721
<i>Like an idiot, I keep listening.</i>

26:46.680 --> 26:47.966
<i>Ava.</i>

26:48.320 --> 26:49.446
<i>Damn.</i>

26:50.640 --> 26:53.211
<i>I should tell her to go to hell.</i>

26:53.360 --> 26:55.647
<i>Instead, I show up 20 minutes early.</i>

26:55.840 --> 26:58.241
<i>What the hell could she want with me now?</i>

26:58.400 --> 27:01.131
<i>You can't drive two blocks in Sin City</i>

27:01.280 --> 27:03.123
<i>without coming across a saloon.</i>

27:04.040 --> 27:05.804
<i>The bad kind.</i>

27:06.520 --> 27:08.170
<i>Why here, Ava?</i>

27:08.320 --> 27:11.881
<i>With you, everything always had
to be first-class.</i>

27:12.200 --> 27:14.646
<i>And when I couldn't foot the bill,</i>

27:14.800 --> 27:17.644
<i>you sure as hell
found somebody who could.</i>

27:18.440 --> 27:20.090
<i>I order up a ginger ale</i>

27:20.280 --> 27:22.851
<i>and stare at it
for the better part of an hour.</i>

27:23.480 --> 27:26.131
She's late, like she always was.

27:27.640 --> 27:29.369
<i>And like always...</i>

27:32.000 --> 27:34.128
<i>she's worth the wait.</i>

27:47.880 --> 27:49.325
Dwight.

27:49.520 --> 27:51.329
How long has it been?

27:51.520 --> 27:53.124
Four years?

27:53.280 --> 27:55.681
Yeah, that sounds about right.

27:55.840 --> 27:57.171
Have a seat.

28:17.120 --> 28:19.407
So many times I've wanted to call you.

28:20.040 --> 28:23.362
I found myself thinking about you, constantly.

28:23.520 --> 28:25.363
I've got places to go,
how about you just

28:25.520 --> 28:27.284
- tell me what you want.
- Don't be cold.

28:27.440 --> 28:29.886
I don't think I could stand that right now.

28:30.800 --> 28:33.280
I must still mean something to you.

28:33.480 --> 28:35.767
You came here. You must still care.

28:35.920 --> 28:39.083
Sure. You called and I came running.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.404
You still got that much
of a hold on me.

28:41.560 --> 28:42.641
Maybe you always will.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.485
But I got no reason at all
to be nice to you.

28:46.160 --> 28:47.810
I guess I deserve that.

28:47.960 --> 28:50.042
Let's not screw around.

28:50.200 --> 28:52.567
I'm here. I'm listening.

28:52.720 --> 28:54.688
Just tell me what the hell
it is you want.

28:54.840 --> 28:56.410
There's only one thing
I want from you,

28:56.560 --> 28:59.370
and I want it so desperately
I could scream.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.688
I want you to forgive me.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.931
So you've got a conscience after all.

29:05.080 --> 29:06.969
Fine. I forgive you.

29:07.120 --> 29:09.043
You got your wish.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.771
Now go home. Sleep tight.

29:13.760 --> 29:15.171
You're right about me.

29:15.640 --> 29:17.324
I'm a selfish slut who threw away

29:17.520 --> 29:19.204
the only man she ever loved.

29:20.040 --> 29:21.769
But I was wrong.

29:21.920 --> 29:23.001
Good one.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.891
I was born at night,
but it wasn't last night.

29:26.240 --> 29:27.651
I'm in hell, Dwight.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.211
It's worse than you can imagine.

29:29.360 --> 29:31.089
You made your bed, sleep in it.

29:31.240 --> 29:32.730
Forgive me, darling, I beg you.

29:32.880 --> 29:34.041
No.

29:34.200 --> 29:35.486
I love you.

29:35.640 --> 29:37.051
No.

29:44.720 --> 29:46.404
No!

29:47.320 --> 29:48.367
You do that again,

29:48.520 --> 29:50.124
I swear to hell I'll kill you.

29:51.880 --> 29:54.087
If you can't forgive me...

29:54.240 --> 29:55.969
then please remember me.

29:56.120 --> 29:59.488
They say you really never die
as long as somebody remembers you.

29:59.880 --> 30:02.201
What the devil are you talking about?

30:02.840 --> 30:04.126
Mrs. Lord.

30:04.320 --> 30:05.810
The weather's inclement,

30:05.960 --> 30:09.806
the neighborhood is bad,
and your present company

30:10.200 --> 30:11.611
is low.

30:11.760 --> 30:14.081
You're due at home, Mrs. Lord.

30:16.160 --> 30:17.969
I'd say that's up to Mrs. Lord.

30:18.320 --> 30:20.129
This is none of your concern, sir.

30:20.280 --> 30:23.090
Any physical contest between us

30:23.240 --> 30:24.810
would have one outcome.

30:24.960 --> 30:26.200
Hey, buddy,

30:26.360 --> 30:28.522
is that dickhead giving you a hard time?

30:28.720 --> 30:31.041
You want me to break him down for you?

30:31.200 --> 30:33.567
I got nothing going on tonight.

30:33.760 --> 30:35.967
That would be an interesting contest.

30:36.120 --> 30:37.485
It's not his fight.

30:37.960 --> 30:39.166
Never mind, Dwight.

30:39.320 --> 30:40.446
It is too late.

30:40.600 --> 30:42.409
I'll go with him.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.484
Too late for what, Ava?

30:44.640 --> 30:46.130
For everything.

30:46.880 --> 30:49.281
Just remember me, my love.

30:49.520 --> 30:51.170
Remember me.

30:53.200 --> 30:55.487
You have business tonight, Mrs. Lord.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.204
Unpleasant business.

30:59.080 --> 31:00.730
I don't care any more.

31:09.360 --> 31:11.966
<i>The night air hasn't gotten any colder.</i>

31:12.120 --> 31:14.248
<i>It just feels that way.</i>

31:14.400 --> 31:16.323
Buddy, I don't mean to poke my nose

31:16.520 --> 31:18.602
where it don't belong, but...

31:18.760 --> 31:21.764
That there is a dame to kill for.

31:22.520 --> 31:23.726
<i>Ava.</i>

31:24.880 --> 31:26.325
<i>Damn.</i>

31:27.360 --> 31:30.443
<i>Night turns to day
and then it's night again,</i>

31:30.600 --> 31:32.807
<i>and there's nowhere to hide.</i>

31:32.960 --> 31:35.406
<i>She isn't worth a moment's thought,</i>

31:35.560 --> 31:37.847
<i>and I can't get her
out of my head.</i>

31:38.520 --> 31:40.682
<i>What am I doing smoking?</i>

31:41.280 --> 31:43.362
<i>Where did I get these cigarettes?</i>

31:47.080 --> 31:49.242
<i>It's Ava making you crazy</i>

31:49.880 --> 31:51.882
<i>all over again.</i>

31:52.440 --> 31:54.602
<i>Never let the monster out.</i>

31:55.320 --> 31:56.606
<i>Shake her off.</i>

31:56.760 --> 31:59.047
<i>Whatever she's in for,
she deserves it.</i>

31:59.800 --> 32:01.882
<i>But I have to know what's wrong.</i>

32:03.480 --> 32:06.643
<i>It's a couple hours' drive
out to Sacred Oaks.</i>

32:07.240 --> 32:09.368
<i>It shouldn't take too much effort</i>

32:09.520 --> 32:11.124
<i>to get to the bottom of this.</i>

32:12.400 --> 32:14.926
<i>Just a simple job
of breaking and entering,</i>

32:15.320 --> 32:17.288
<i>punishable by up to five years
in the slammer,</i>

32:17.440 --> 32:20.364
<i>even if I don't kill anybody.</i>

32:31.600 --> 32:35.446
<i>I wind up seeing a lot more of Ava
than I bargained for.</i>

32:52.640 --> 32:55.849
<i>And she seems perfectly goddamn fine.</i>

32:56.000 --> 32:57.923
<i>Not roughed up.</i>

32:58.120 --> 33:01.363
<i>Just the rich man's wife
she always intended to be.</i>

33:06.040 --> 33:07.724
<i>I'm a damned fool.</i>

33:08.320 --> 33:10.049
Freeze, pervert.

33:26.000 --> 33:27.684
Let me through, Manute.

33:33.560 --> 33:35.289
I'm sorry, Dwight.

33:40.920 --> 33:43.526
<i>An atom bomb goes off between my legs.</i>

33:45.360 --> 33:47.567
<i>A freight train barrels into my jaw.</i>

33:50.880 --> 33:53.850
<i>I've taken a beating before,
but never like this.</i>

33:55.480 --> 33:56.606
<i>Never like this.</i>

33:58.280 --> 34:00.282
<i>The sounds go wet.</i>

34:01.200 --> 34:02.884
<i>Maybe he keeps hitting me.</i>

34:03.160 --> 34:04.764
<i>I don't know.</i>

34:04.920 --> 34:06.684
<i>I'm gone.</i>

34:07.000 --> 34:10.368
<i>Gone to that place
where there's no pain or thought.</i>

34:14.199 --> 34:15.645
<i>I wake up in midair.</i>

34:16.920 --> 34:20.561
<i>The pavement rushes up
to give me a big sloppy kiss.</i>

34:29.880 --> 34:31.405
<i>I'll be damned.</i>

34:31.560 --> 34:33.369
<i>Door-to-door service.</i>

34:34.800 --> 34:36.802
<i>Then I spot my Mustang,</i>

34:36.960 --> 34:39.007
<i>which makes no sense.</i>

34:39.239 --> 34:41.447
<i>Why would they return my car?</i>

34:57.960 --> 34:59.450
Get out of here.

35:00.280 --> 35:01.645
No.

35:03.800 --> 35:06.929
Put your clothes back on
and get out of here now.

35:07.920 --> 35:09.331
No.

35:10.280 --> 35:11.691
You had your chance.

35:12.120 --> 35:14.805
I would have stayed away,
but you came for me.

35:15.560 --> 35:17.050
You still want me.

35:17.640 --> 35:19.642
And I'm yours. Now.

35:19.840 --> 35:21.001
Tonight.

35:21.440 --> 35:23.920
Get out of my life once and for all,

35:24.440 --> 35:26.807
or I'll bash your teeth in.

35:27.240 --> 35:28.526
If you can't love me...

35:30.600 --> 35:31.681
hate me.

35:32.440 --> 35:35.649
If you can't forgive me, punish me.

35:36.040 --> 35:39.601
Make me hurt like I've hurt you.

35:47.080 --> 35:49.731
<i>I call her every foul name there is.</i>

35:50.760 --> 35:53.525
<i>She makes my name sound like music.</i>

35:54.520 --> 35:57.285
<i>Like a chant to some dark god.</i>

35:58.400 --> 36:01.006
<i>She's slippery with sweat.</i>

36:01.160 --> 36:04.243
<i>Before long, my hatred is spent,</i>

36:05.280 --> 36:07.123
<i>but she won't let go.</i>

36:07.280 --> 36:09.009
<i>She kisses me</i>

36:09.160 --> 36:11.242
<i>and coaxes me</i>

36:11.400 --> 36:13.846
<i>and the fire grows again.</i>

36:14.640 --> 36:18.042
<i>I say all the things
I swore I'd never say again.</i>

36:18.520 --> 36:20.124
<i>She owns me.</i>

36:20.320 --> 36:21.970
<i>Body and soul.</i>

36:26.720 --> 36:28.210
Tell me everything.

36:29.720 --> 36:32.087
Manute, the man who beat you...

36:33.640 --> 36:35.881
He's a specialist in inflicting pain.

36:36.120 --> 36:38.726
Hideous pain, in all the places
you just gave me joy.

36:38.920 --> 36:40.365
That's sick.

36:41.360 --> 36:42.725
That's crazy.

36:42.880 --> 36:46.441
Damien, my husband, he talks and talks

36:46.720 --> 36:48.051
and watches.

36:48.840 --> 36:50.569
It's worse each time.

36:50.920 --> 36:54.083
He's getting closer
to his final, sick climax.

36:54.240 --> 36:56.811
He says I'll be very ugly
before I die.

36:58.680 --> 37:00.284
Ava, you're not gonna die.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.005
You're coming with me.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.086
It's hopeless.

37:08.320 --> 37:10.084
He lets me run away.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.810
Even laughs about it.

37:12.840 --> 37:15.286
Doesn't care where I go, what I do.

37:15.480 --> 37:17.926
He knows Manute will always find me.

37:20.520 --> 37:22.204
Isn't that right, Manute?

37:23.200 --> 37:27.205
Madam, Mr. Lord will require
that you be disciplined.

37:28.280 --> 37:29.964
No, Dwight! Don't fight him!

37:30.120 --> 37:31.167
He'll kill you!

37:31.680 --> 37:32.727
He's not human.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.600
<i>I punch a vault door.</i>

37:35.640 --> 37:38.803
<i>It doesn't fall down,
so I punch it again.</i>

37:47.000 --> 37:49.651
<i>A wrecking ball hits me
square in the chest.</i>

37:55.360 --> 37:56.691
Mrs. Lord, your coat.

37:57.640 --> 37:59.404
We have an appointment.

38:00.840 --> 38:02.683
<i>They can't take her away from me.</i>

38:03.680 --> 38:05.250
<i>Not this time.</i>

38:07.880 --> 38:10.167
<i>I know exactly what to do.</i>

38:11.200 --> 38:13.248
<i>I know exactly where to go.</i>

38:17.120 --> 38:19.487
<i>Now here's a girl with protection.</i>

38:19.720 --> 38:21.722
<i>She may be showing off
everything she's got</i>

38:21.880 --> 38:24.565
<i>in a ratty dive full of horny drunks,</i>

38:24.720 --> 38:27.690
<i>but Nancy's the safest gal in the world.</i>

38:27.960 --> 38:32.682
<i>Make a grab for Nancy and you're up
against 300 pounds of iron</i>

38:32.840 --> 38:35.923
<i>that goes by the name of Marv.</i>

38:53.760 --> 38:54.761
Marv.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.126
Dwight.

38:58.440 --> 39:00.522
I didn't even see you there.

39:00.880 --> 39:02.291
What can I do you for?

39:02.960 --> 39:04.007
I need your help.

39:04.640 --> 39:05.721
It's bad.

39:06.040 --> 39:08.361
It means going up against a lot of guns.

39:10.680 --> 39:11.966
Count me in.

39:12.760 --> 39:14.205
I could use a change of pace.

39:15.360 --> 39:17.203
<i>We finish off the bottle,</i>

39:17.560 --> 39:20.689
<i>letting its liquid darkness
fill us both.</i>

39:21.120 --> 39:24.408
<i>When I'm sure he's had enough
to make him good and dangerous,</i>

39:24.760 --> 39:26.649
<i>I tell him about Ava,</i>

39:26.960 --> 39:29.042
<i>and his eyes go killer red.</i>

39:29.600 --> 39:31.602
<i>I know he's willing to die for me,</i>

39:31.800 --> 39:33.609
<i>if that's what it takes.</i>

39:34.520 --> 39:35.760
<i>So I'm using him.</i>

39:35.920 --> 39:37.285
<i>So what?</i>

39:37.440 --> 39:39.329
<i>So he breaks the faces
I want him to break</i>

39:39.520 --> 39:41.488
<i>instead of somebody else's.</i>

39:41.960 --> 39:44.566
<i>So he helps me get Ava
back in my arms again</i>

39:44.720 --> 39:48.486
<i>instead of sleeping it off
in a flophouse or gutter.</i>

39:48.640 --> 39:50.768
<i>His life isn't worth a damn, anyway.</i>

39:51.560 --> 39:53.403
<i>If I don't get him killed,
the world will,</i>

39:53.720 --> 39:55.210
<i>one way or another.</i>

39:55.360 --> 39:57.966
I want you to leave
that thing in the car.

39:58.160 --> 39:59.764
Nobody's getting killed tonight.

39:59.920 --> 40:02.400
Come on, Dwight.
You ain't no fun at all.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.527
<i>We split up at the gate.</i>

40:14.840 --> 40:17.571
<i>It doesn't take Marv long
to get their attention.</i>

40:30.800 --> 40:32.643
You've trespassed on hallowed ground.

40:32.800 --> 40:35.007
You're the slug that hurt my friend, huh?

40:36.760 --> 40:38.205
Shall we?

41:22.600 --> 41:25.922
Haven't had my hand around
one of these in days.

41:31.520 --> 41:33.329
<i>I'll find the truth about Ava</i>

41:33.480 --> 41:36.290
<i>and what's happening to her now.</i>

41:37.440 --> 41:39.124
<i>He'll tell me.</i>

41:39.320 --> 41:41.084
<i>I'll get it out of him.</i>

41:42.320 --> 41:43.970
<i>Damien Lord.</i>

41:48.280 --> 41:49.805
Where is she?

41:51.800 --> 41:53.564
What have you done with her?

41:53.840 --> 41:56.810
Have you come to take her away
from all this?

41:58.880 --> 42:02.930
And what is "all this,"
in her present stories?

42:03.120 --> 42:05.168
I haven't the slightest notion what

42:05.320 --> 42:07.527
nonsense my wife has told you.

42:07.680 --> 42:09.648
Nor do I care.

42:09.800 --> 42:11.723
It's all lies.

42:12.960 --> 42:14.883
Stay away from the desk.

42:16.480 --> 42:19.723
The woman is pathological.

42:23.120 --> 42:24.884
You've been deceived.

42:43.240 --> 42:44.730
What did it feel like?

42:45.080 --> 42:46.491
What?

42:47.280 --> 42:49.089
Murdering an innocent man.

42:49.480 --> 42:51.642
I just want to know what it felt like.

42:51.800 --> 42:53.040
Must have been beautiful.

42:53.200 --> 42:55.487
What are you talking about, innocence?

42:55.640 --> 42:57.563
I knew I could count on you.

42:57.760 --> 42:59.330
Sex always made you stupid,

42:59.480 --> 43:01.562
ready to believe anything.

43:01.880 --> 43:04.850
You've just made me a very rich woman.

43:06.440 --> 43:08.169
Do me one last favor, lover.

43:08.320 --> 43:10.971
Stay still long enough for me
to blow your brains out.

43:15.720 --> 43:17.768
I'm not much of a shot.

43:18.400 --> 43:20.528
- But I do my best.
- Ava...

43:22.520 --> 43:25.330
I planned it and you fell for it.

43:26.040 --> 43:29.203
This is the last time
I'm ever gonna need anything from a man.

43:29.640 --> 43:32.803
The last time I make my living on my back.

43:34.760 --> 43:36.569
Manute never hurt you?

43:36.720 --> 43:38.449
He wouldn't dare.

43:38.600 --> 43:39.806
You're insane.

43:39.960 --> 43:41.405
No, Dwight.

43:41.560 --> 43:44.370
A crazy person would be anyone
who believes me.

43:44.520 --> 43:46.568
And that would be you.

43:47.440 --> 43:49.488
If I kissed you now, Dwight,

43:49.640 --> 43:51.369
would you still believe it was...

43:52.120 --> 43:53.451
love?

44:00.000 --> 44:01.286
Ava...

44:17.800 --> 44:19.211
Damn!

44:19.800 --> 44:22.087
Hey, I handled that big slug
just like I promised.

44:22.240 --> 44:24.368
I didn't kill him,
I didn't even cripple him.

44:25.680 --> 44:27.921
Six months in traction, that's all, tops.

44:28.200 --> 44:30.567
I took an eye out of him, though.

44:32.800 --> 44:34.680
Listen, before you say anything,

44:34.760 --> 44:37.730
I know I was supposed to take the 'Stang
to make my getaway,

44:37.880 --> 44:40.080
but when I saw this beauty here
sitting there, you know,

44:40.200 --> 44:41.850
the keys in the ignition and everything,

44:42.000 --> 44:44.287
I couldn't pass up a chance to take a drive

44:44.440 --> 44:45.851
in an honest-to-God Tucker.

44:46.000 --> 44:47.604
Pull over!

44:50.840 --> 44:53.491
You know, they only made
a couple dozen of these beauties.

44:53.640 --> 44:55.449
I saw a movie about it once.

44:55.600 --> 44:57.090
Oh, here I am jabbering,

44:57.240 --> 44:58.924
and you're leaking all over the place.

45:00.760 --> 45:02.762
I'll get you to a guy I know.

45:03.520 --> 45:06.808
He's good with bullets
and he don't ask questions.

45:06.960 --> 45:08.405
Get me to Old Town.

45:08.600 --> 45:10.011
Let me level with you, pal.

45:10.160 --> 45:12.128
You ain't gonna make it to Old Town.

45:12.280 --> 45:13.930
<i>I'll make it.</i>

45:14.080 --> 45:17.243
<i>I've got too much I've got to do
to let myself die.</i>

45:19.640 --> 45:21.130
Old Town.

45:25.360 --> 45:27.522
He left a lot of blood, Mrs. Lord.

45:27.760 --> 45:29.125
He won't get far.

45:30.360 --> 45:32.169
You said you knew him.

45:33.120 --> 45:34.770
The killer's name is Dwight.

45:34.960 --> 45:36.371
Dwight McCarthy.

45:37.200 --> 45:38.690
You knew him in what sense?

45:38.880 --> 45:40.882
Why, the biblical one.

45:41.400 --> 45:43.209
I'm sorry, Lieutenant.

45:43.360 --> 45:45.681
You've been so very patient with me.

45:45.840 --> 45:47.888
Here we've barely met, and already I...

45:48.560 --> 45:50.210
I feel I can trust you.

45:50.360 --> 45:51.725
You can trust me.

45:54.520 --> 45:57.603
We were together for a while
a few years ago.

45:57.920 --> 45:59.604
It went badly.

46:00.440 --> 46:01.805
He went insane.

46:02.120 --> 46:04.805
He started imagining things,
accusing me of things.

46:05.040 --> 46:07.008
He followed me wherever I went.

46:07.840 --> 46:10.491
Recently, he broke into this very property.

46:10.640 --> 46:12.130
He beat you?

46:14.080 --> 46:15.969
When he drank,

46:16.120 --> 46:17.610
he drank a lot.

46:17.760 --> 46:18.840
You stay with this nutcase?

46:18.960 --> 46:20.291
Never mind that.

46:21.560 --> 46:23.801
You'd be surprised
how much a woman can take.

46:23.960 --> 46:25.041
You were terrified.

46:28.600 --> 46:30.329
It was Damien who took me away.

46:31.600 --> 46:35.400
He was so gentle and sure.

46:36.000 --> 46:39.686
I suppose I'm a woman
who needs protection.

46:39.840 --> 46:41.524
He made me feel safe.

46:41.920 --> 46:45.083
But then, Dwight, he found me somehow.

46:45.320 --> 46:47.482
He started calling me late at night,

46:47.640 --> 46:49.085
making awful threats.

46:50.600 --> 46:52.807
And now Damien's dead

46:53.680 --> 46:55.284
and I'm alone.

46:55.440 --> 46:57.488
Oh, please, Lieutenant!

47:03.680 --> 47:05.364
Call me Mort.

47:05.640 --> 47:07.881
Nothing like a widow in need of comfort.

47:08.040 --> 47:09.280
I got a stiffy just watching.

47:09.440 --> 47:10.441
Man, she is primed.

47:10.640 --> 47:11.846
Just drop it, Bob.

47:12.000 --> 47:13.440
You don't pass up a chance like that.

47:13.600 --> 47:15.250
What's the point of being a Sin City cop,

47:15.400 --> 47:17.084
if you don't get the perks?

47:17.240 --> 47:18.844
I'm a married man, Bob.

47:20.280 --> 47:21.611
I don't care what you are.

47:21.760 --> 47:23.489
I mean, just take a look at that babe.

47:24.200 --> 47:25.770
That's enough, Bob.

47:32.360 --> 47:33.885
<i>This doesn't look good.</i>

47:42.240 --> 47:44.288
<i>One squad car still chases us.</i>

47:44.680 --> 47:46.409
<i>Must be a rookie driving.</i>

47:46.880 --> 47:48.166
<i>His buddies should have told him</i>

47:48.320 --> 47:51.130
<i>the girls of Old Town
have laws all their own.</i>

47:51.720 --> 47:53.882
<i>And they don't take kindly to cops.</i>

47:55.120 --> 47:56.290
Old Town!

47:56.840 --> 47:58.569
Oh, you're a genius, kid!

48:28.640 --> 48:30.449
Here we are, pal.

48:30.600 --> 48:32.120
All of a sudden, this doesn't look like

48:32.240 --> 48:33.890
the brightest idea you ever had.

48:36.400 --> 48:38.084
You have ten seconds to tell us

48:38.240 --> 48:40.607
what you're doing bringing cops
to Old Town.

48:41.800 --> 48:43.325
We got us a problem.

48:44.280 --> 48:45.850
I don't fight girls.

48:46.000 --> 48:47.001
Gail...

48:49.280 --> 48:50.361
It's me.

48:50.520 --> 48:51.521
Dwight.

48:53.040 --> 48:54.769
What have they done to you?

48:54.920 --> 48:58.242
<i>A corkscrew stabs me
square in the chest...</i>

48:59.800 --> 49:01.325
<i>and twists.</i>

49:02.280 --> 49:03.281
Get Molly!

49:05.160 --> 49:06.446
Get everybody.

49:22.320 --> 49:23.890
It's about time.

49:26.440 --> 49:27.441
Hello?

49:27.800 --> 49:28.961
Mrs. Lord.

49:29.560 --> 49:31.050
Lieutenant.

49:31.680 --> 49:32.681
Mort.

49:32.840 --> 49:34.046
<i>You're so kind to call.</i>

49:34.240 --> 49:35.526
I hope I didn't wake you.

49:35.680 --> 49:36.727
No, I wasn't sleeping.

49:36.880 --> 49:38.769
I haven't slept at all.

49:39.080 --> 49:40.844
I'm jumping at every sound,

49:41.040 --> 49:42.804
just knowing he's still out there.

49:43.240 --> 49:45.481
I guess I'm not a very strong person.

49:46.360 --> 49:49.330
<i>And me in this house, all alone.</i>

49:49.480 --> 49:51.360
You shouldn't be so hard
on yourself, Mrs. Lord.

49:51.480 --> 49:53.767
<i>You're having a very understandable reaction.</i>

49:54.200 --> 49:56.043
If there's anything
at all I can do for you...

49:56.600 --> 49:59.410
<i>I know it's a bad thing
to think of you the way I do.</i>

49:59.600 --> 50:02.251
It's inconvenient.

50:03.360 --> 50:06.284
"But who ever loved,
loved not at first sight?"

50:07.760 --> 50:10.286
I've thought about you since I saw you.

50:12.120 --> 50:14.043
I'm thinking about you now.

50:14.240 --> 50:15.924
<i>Are you thinking about me?</i>

50:17.320 --> 50:18.526
Yes.

50:18.680 --> 50:20.842
I hate myself for saying this, but...

50:21.000 --> 50:24.800
<i>I just don't know
if I could bear to be alone tonight.</i>

50:50.720 --> 50:52.165
<i>My heart beats.</i>

50:52.360 --> 50:55.011
<i>I take in the rich,
burnt smell of coffee.</i>

50:59.480 --> 51:00.686
<i>Gail.</i>

51:00.840 --> 51:03.161
<i>She's reason enough to open my eyes.</i>

51:03.560 --> 51:04.607
Can you hear me, Dwight?

51:06.560 --> 51:08.289
Cops want you bad, Dwight.

51:09.080 --> 51:10.411
Really bad.

51:11.240 --> 51:12.651
But don't worry.

51:13.000 --> 51:14.684
We'll fix you up.

51:14.880 --> 51:16.120
And when we do,

51:16.360 --> 51:18.089
when you're all better,

51:19.000 --> 51:21.844
I'll deck you for leaving
in the first place.

51:22.000 --> 51:23.764
I told you you'd be back.

51:24.040 --> 51:25.451
I told you...

51:26.200 --> 51:28.328
you belong here.

51:28.520 --> 51:30.249
Jerk!

51:30.640 --> 51:32.961
I thought there was another world out there.

51:34.080 --> 51:36.321
I thought I could be a part of it.

51:37.000 --> 51:38.684
There's only Sin City.

51:42.760 --> 51:44.762
Molly said you're ready to leave.

51:44.920 --> 51:47.366
- No, I'm staying.
- Wrong answer.

51:47.600 --> 51:48.931
Miho?

51:50.160 --> 51:51.969
<i>Deadly little Miho.</i>

51:52.480 --> 51:54.960
<i>If she recognizes me,
she doesn't let it show.</i>

51:55.120 --> 51:56.724
Oh, you picked the wrong neighborhood

51:56.920 --> 51:58.081
for your hideout.

51:58.240 --> 52:00.049
Alive or dead, you're leaving.

52:00.480 --> 52:01.766
I'm staying.

52:06.080 --> 52:08.526
I don't think he can feel it, Miho.

52:08.680 --> 52:10.011
Give it a twist.

52:11.280 --> 52:14.284
You won't give with any more lip
about staying here

52:14.480 --> 52:17.484
or Miho will have to exhale.

52:18.040 --> 52:21.726
And that heart Molly worked so hard to fix
will just pop like a grape.

52:22.240 --> 52:23.321
He's staying.

52:24.000 --> 52:25.843
And if you're going to kill him,

52:26.000 --> 52:27.889
you better kill me, too.

52:28.680 --> 52:31.411
Even though he doesn't feel
the same way about me,

52:31.560 --> 52:33.369
he's the only man I'll ever love.

52:33.520 --> 52:37.570
<i>They all seemed to be waiting
for the other shoe to drop.</i>

52:37.720 --> 52:39.006
<i>Gail drops it.</i>

52:39.160 --> 52:41.208
It was dark in that alley, Miho,

52:41.840 --> 52:43.046
when you were 15.

52:43.200 --> 52:45.771
You killed three of the Tong.

52:46.960 --> 52:49.611
<i>But the last two had the drop on you.</i>

52:49.760 --> 52:50.761
<i>You were dead,</i>

52:52.040 --> 52:53.963
<i>Until someone appeared.</i>

52:54.520 --> 52:56.727
<i>You never got a good look
at the man who saved you.</i>

52:58.000 --> 53:00.048
Take a look now.

53:05.560 --> 53:07.164
<i>I get more time...</i>

53:08.600 --> 53:10.284
<i>and more surgery.</i>

53:11.800 --> 53:13.484
Listen, there-there's only one person

53:13.640 --> 53:15.680
that has anything to gain
from snuffing Damien Lord,

53:15.800 --> 53:17.240
and you're too busy banging the broad

53:17.360 --> 53:19.560
- to bring her in for questioning.
- You don't know her.

53:19.680 --> 53:22.441
You don't know anything about her,
and I'll be damned if I let you use

53:22.560 --> 53:24.360
that kind of language
when you talk about her.

53:24.480 --> 53:25.720
You're in love with her.

53:25.880 --> 53:28.247
You stupid schmuck.

53:28.400 --> 53:30.164
It's one thing to poke
a babe on the side,

53:30.320 --> 53:31.640
but you can't even think straight.

53:31.760 --> 53:33.330
Shut the hell up!

53:34.240 --> 53:35.844
I know what I'm doing.

53:36.640 --> 53:38.563
I guess I should've told you everything.

53:40.040 --> 53:41.769
Damn right you should have.

53:45.200 --> 53:47.089
He raped me.

53:48.240 --> 53:50.208
He almost killed me.

53:51.400 --> 53:52.640
That son of a bitch.

53:52.800 --> 53:54.643
I thought I could reason with him,

53:54.800 --> 53:57.929
but he was worse than ever.

53:58.080 --> 54:01.289
His hands at my throat, strangling me

54:01.440 --> 54:04.967
while he did what he needed to do.

54:05.480 --> 54:09.166
Not while I'm around.

54:09.320 --> 54:10.481
He'll kill me.

54:10.680 --> 54:12.250
Kill me! Kill me!

54:12.400 --> 54:13.765
I have only you.

54:13.920 --> 54:14.967
I love you, Mort.

54:15.120 --> 54:16.281
Keep me safe.

54:16.480 --> 54:18.130
Keep me! Keep me!

54:18.280 --> 54:19.361
Keep me!

54:22.080 --> 54:23.206
Ava Lord.

54:23.760 --> 54:25.603
For once, you missed my heart.

54:26.560 --> 54:28.449
<i>I'm healing quickly, Ava.</i>

54:30.000 --> 54:32.162
I'll be coming for you soon.

54:35.480 --> 54:36.960
You know where he is,
and you won't do

54:37.080 --> 54:38.411
a damn thing about it.

54:38.560 --> 54:40.528
You don't know what you're asking.

54:41.080 --> 54:43.367
We have to wait for Old Town
to give him up.

54:43.520 --> 54:45.010
It's the only way.

54:45.640 --> 54:47.210
You're a Sin City cop.

54:47.360 --> 54:49.727
You've got a badge and a gun.
You've got power.

54:49.880 --> 54:51.041
Use it.

54:52.640 --> 54:54.847
If you ever want to have this woman again,

54:55.360 --> 54:56.771
be a man.

54:56.920 --> 54:58.604
If you're a man,

54:59.000 --> 55:00.445
kill him.

55:08.320 --> 55:10.368
Don't move.

55:10.520 --> 55:12.488
McCarthy.

55:12.640 --> 55:14.563
You never tortured her.

55:15.200 --> 55:16.804
You two cooked that up.

55:17.000 --> 55:18.331
You were her lover.

55:18.560 --> 55:19.925
You're a fool.

55:20.120 --> 55:22.282
The Goddess takes no lover.

55:23.120 --> 55:25.168
The Goddess makes slaves of men.

55:25.320 --> 55:28.164
In an instant,
she can see to the heart of you

55:28.320 --> 55:30.926
and transform to your deepest desire.

55:32.200 --> 55:35.010
To Damien Lord, she was the princess bride.

55:35.160 --> 55:38.323
To you, a damsel in distress.

55:38.720 --> 55:40.643
She devoured all of you.

55:40.800 --> 55:43.371
You cannot defeat the Goddess.

55:44.440 --> 55:46.283
She cannot die.

55:46.440 --> 55:48.283
You're as crazy as she is.

55:48.760 --> 55:50.046
If you were as rotten as her,

55:50.240 --> 55:52.288
I would blow your brains out right now,

55:52.440 --> 55:54.522
but I'm trying to be careful
about who I kill,

55:54.680 --> 55:57.160
and all you did was pound
the crap out of me.

55:57.320 --> 55:59.288
You've already paid an eye for that.

55:59.440 --> 56:01.841
I'm letting you go with a warning.

56:02.440 --> 56:04.283
Stay in bed.

56:04.440 --> 56:06.283
Don't go back to work.

56:06.960 --> 56:09.247
And don't get in my way.

56:09.960 --> 56:12.361
<i>No, Ava, you're no goddess.</i>

56:12.520 --> 56:13.965
<i>You're a witch.</i>

56:14.120 --> 56:15.406
<i>A predator.</i>

56:15.600 --> 56:17.364
<i>Maybe I only got what I deserved,</i>

56:17.560 --> 56:18.721
<i>but what about the others?</i>

56:18.880 --> 56:21.121
<i>Good men driven mad.</i>

56:21.360 --> 56:22.771
You really lost it.

56:22.920 --> 56:24.729
Bad enough you leave your wife
for that skank.

56:24.880 --> 56:26.760
You watch what you call her,
you son of a bitch.

56:26.880 --> 56:28.803
You're throwing away your career.

56:28.960 --> 56:31.122
Hell, you're committing suicide,
you stupid shit.

56:31.320 --> 56:32.481
I know what I'm doing.

56:32.640 --> 56:33.801
I'm going to Old Town.

56:33.960 --> 56:35.610
I'm gonna nail this guy once and for all.

56:35.760 --> 56:37.171
If I have to go it alone,

56:37.320 --> 56:38.810
I will.

56:38.960 --> 56:40.325
Do me a favor, turn the car around

56:40.480 --> 56:42.084
and you go back to the station.

56:42.240 --> 56:43.815
You got to come clean with the captain.

56:43.840 --> 56:45.046
I'm a cop. I'm doing my job.

56:45.200 --> 56:46.326
I'm hunting down a murderer.

56:46.480 --> 56:48.164
Look, you got to ditch that dame.

56:48.320 --> 56:49.401
That's enough!

56:49.560 --> 56:51.210
We won't talk about Ava.

56:51.360 --> 56:53.169
Somebody has got to set you straight.

56:53.560 --> 56:55.528
You've got to forget
about that stupid whore.

56:55.720 --> 56:57.848
Turn the car around
or I'm turning you in.

56:58.000 --> 56:59.464
I warned you.

56:59.920 --> 57:01.081
Every day,

57:01.240 --> 57:02.730
I warned you!

57:03.040 --> 57:05.407
But you keep asking for it!

57:05.560 --> 57:07.005
And asking for it!

57:07.360 --> 57:08.771
Well, here it is, pal.

57:08.920 --> 57:10.046
Mort, no.

57:33.240 --> 57:36.084
<i>A witch, a predator.</i>

57:36.240 --> 57:38.322
<i>Destroying lives.</i>

57:38.760 --> 57:40.649
<i>Sometimes for power.</i>

57:40.800 --> 57:42.643
<i>Sometimes for profit.</i>

57:43.040 --> 57:45.611
<i>Sometimes for sport.</i>

57:46.840 --> 57:49.366
<i>But now you're locked away
in your mansion.</i>

57:49.520 --> 57:52.091
<i>A bird of prey in a gilded cage.</i>

57:52.720 --> 57:54.802
<i>Are you ready to do something stupid?</i>

57:54.960 --> 57:57.247
I'm so happy you chose
to attend my little party,

57:57.400 --> 57:58.925
Herr Wallenquist.

57:59.920 --> 58:03.003
Your invitation surprised me, Mrs. Lord.

58:03.160 --> 58:06.243
Your husband had no criminal associations.

58:06.400 --> 58:08.209
Believe me, I tried.

58:08.360 --> 58:10.362
May I speak truthfully, Mr. Wallenquist?

58:10.520 --> 58:11.931
Please.

58:12.080 --> 58:14.447
Old Town is a thorn in your side.

58:14.600 --> 58:16.170
Indeed, it is.

58:16.320 --> 58:19.085
All those profits in the hands of whores.

58:19.320 --> 58:21.766
Surely you've wanted
to put them in their place.

58:21.920 --> 58:24.651
Make some adjustment to the balance of power.

58:24.800 --> 58:27.167
Show them who rules Sin City.

58:27.520 --> 58:30.729
You have limited influence on me, Mrs. Lord.

58:30.880 --> 58:32.803
I haven't been doing so very badly.

58:32.960 --> 58:34.371
But those two policemen,

58:34.520 --> 58:36.761
that was an embarrassing blunder.

58:38.680 --> 58:40.011
Yes.

58:40.200 --> 58:42.441
I'm out of my league.

58:43.200 --> 58:45.601
I need a stronger, more experienced hand.

58:46.440 --> 58:51.002
I need Lord Enterprises joined in matrimony

58:51.160 --> 58:53.606
with the expertise and iron fist

58:53.800 --> 58:55.689
of Alarich Wallenquist.

58:56.360 --> 58:57.407
What you need

58:57.560 --> 59:00.006
is the corpse of Dwight McCarthy

59:00.880 --> 59:03.884
and a suicide note
in which he confesses to the murder

59:04.040 --> 59:05.769
of Damien Lord.

59:05.920 --> 59:07.251
And you need to show

59:07.400 --> 59:09.129
those Old Town bitches who's boss.

59:09.280 --> 59:11.282
Indeed, I do.

59:12.600 --> 59:14.523
<i>There's a specialist in Texas.</i>

59:15.160 --> 59:17.367
<i>I could have him on a train tomorrow.</i>

59:17.520 --> 59:19.090
<i>I'll brief him myself.</i>

59:19.280 --> 59:21.601
<i>He'll be on your doorstep at midnight.</i>

59:21.880 --> 59:23.644
<i>And I'll be yours forever.</i>

59:23.800 --> 59:25.768
<i>Pray for your soul, Ava.</i>

59:26.840 --> 59:30.287
<i>This won't be its last visit to Sin City.</i>

59:31.320 --> 59:33.049
Good evening, Mr. Campbell.

59:33.520 --> 59:34.442
I'll take your bag.

59:34.600 --> 59:36.489
Nobody touches my gear.

59:36.640 --> 59:38.051
And I got somebody picking me up

59:38.200 --> 59:40.441
whose one hell of a lot cuter than you.

59:44.840 --> 59:47.161
It was our understanding
that you would travel alone.

59:47.680 --> 59:49.569
I'm full of surprises.

59:51.120 --> 59:54.169
Shuffle that booty over
to the shotgun side, doll.

59:54.360 --> 59:55.805
I'm driving.

59:57.320 --> 59:58.242
We'll follow you.

59:58.400 --> 59:59.890
Mrs. Lord may not be pleased.

01:00:00.040 --> 01:00:01.371
She's the one with the problem.

01:00:01.520 --> 01:00:03.363
I can always get back on the train.

01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.764
Wait here.

01:00:24.880 --> 01:00:26.370
Hurry back.

01:00:26.880 --> 01:00:28.882
You know I get impatient.

01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.883
And you know I get a little crazy

01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:33.008
when I get impatient.

01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:37.128
Boogaard, watch this woman.

01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:42.281
Jacoby.

01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:45.041
If this man moves, kill him.

01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:47.604
I thought this was business.

01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:50.923
My compliments to your surgeon, Mr. McCarthy.

01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:53.168
Remarkable transformation,

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:54.964
but you still have the eyes.

01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.123
The eyes of a dead man.

01:01:01.560 --> 01:01:03.403
I hate being left alone.

01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:06.404
When I'm alone,

01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:08.921
it makes me want to do all kinds

01:01:09.080 --> 01:01:10.764
of crazy things.

01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:17.368
No woman should be left alone
with a man like you.

01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.291
Do you want me

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:23.880
to do something we shouldn't?

01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.683
My lips are sealed.

01:01:32.440 --> 01:01:34.681
There's something I need in the trunk.

01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:46.165
Bear witness.

01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:53.722
Mrs. Lord, the specialist has arrived.

01:01:54.200 --> 01:01:55.850
<i>The bathing thing with her</i>

01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:57.729
<i>was never about bathing.</i>

01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:00.242
<i>It was always theater.</i>

01:02:00.840 --> 01:02:02.888
<i>Or maybe it was retail.</i>

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:06.964
<i>You can't make a sale
without showing the goods.</i>

01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:08.970
It's McCarthy.

01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:42.046
Do you mind if I say

01:02:42.200 --> 01:02:44.328
that you're twice the man
I thought you were.

01:02:44.840 --> 01:02:46.285
You're a warrior.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:48.806
A killer.

01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:51.922
You're everything I want out of a man,

01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:55.162
but I could never get
the honesty out of you.

01:02:55.320 --> 01:02:56.970
You could've been everything I needed.

01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.890
You still could be.

01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:01.770
You're a new man.

01:03:02.920 --> 01:03:04.729
<i>Remember what she did.</i>

01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:07.250
<i>Remember what she is.</i>

01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:09.929
<i>Wait for your opening.</i>

01:03:10.920 --> 01:03:13.127
<i>Wait for Gail to do her bit.</i>

01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.848
When you're immune to me,
I'll let you know.

01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:19.889
Step back, mistress.

01:03:20.040 --> 01:03:21.849
Let me kill him.

01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:23.891
Please.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:27.771
Do.

01:04:48.120 --> 01:04:49.690
Six shots

01:04:49.840 --> 01:04:51.410
without a single head wound.

01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:07.640
<i>Then it all gets down to speed and luck.</i>

01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:21.527
<i>Her eyes are wet and full of love.</i>

01:05:38.520 --> 01:05:40.204
I never dreamed.

01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:43.288
You're everything I've ever wanted.

01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.642
Everything I need.

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:49.565
You and me, forever.

01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.004
It's over.

01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:54.169
Pain has set you free.

01:05:55.720 --> 01:05:57.688
You're no good any more, Dwight.

01:05:57.840 --> 01:05:59.604
You're more like me.

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.211
Be like me.

01:06:02.080 --> 01:06:03.809
Let the old Dwight go.

01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:06.082
Let it go with his old face.

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:09.091
<i>She pulls close,</i>

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:10.969
<i>and I've got to look.</i>

01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:13.408
<i>And all I want is
to be lost in the sight</i>

01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:15.403
<i>and sound and smell of her.</i>

01:06:16.360 --> 01:06:17.964
<i>I can't think straight.</i>

01:06:18.160 --> 01:06:19.321
We can be free.

01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:21.690
We can be happy.

01:06:22.240 --> 01:06:25.084
Together forever.

01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.004
No.

01:06:27.800 --> 01:06:30.849
<i>Her kiss is a promise of paradise.</i>

01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:37.004
Dwight.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.731
<i>The gun barks and bucks in my hand.</i>

01:06:42.120 --> 01:06:45.602
<i>Life leaves Ava with a sigh.</i>

01:06:50.120 --> 01:06:51.822
<i>Sirens climb the hill.</i>

01:06:52.720 --> 01:06:54.449
<i>We'll take the back roads.</i>

01:06:54.600 --> 01:06:56.329
<i>The old bootlegger roads.</i>

01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:58.811
<i>They'll never catch us.</i>

01:07:00.480 --> 01:07:02.403
<i>I'm going home.</i>

01:07:19.760 --> 01:07:22.161
<i>Walk down the right back alley in Sin City,</i>

01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:25.051
<i>and you can find anything.</i>

01:07:27.720 --> 01:07:30.644
I was told I could find a man here
by the name of Mr. Kroenig.

01:07:35.120 --> 01:07:38.283
That's Dr. Kroenig

01:07:38.440 --> 01:07:39.601
to you.

01:07:39.760 --> 01:07:40.966
Yes, sir.

01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.049
License or no license,

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:46.802
these hands still got what it takes.

01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:49.244
Once I'm prepped.

01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.129
How much you got?

01:07:56.200 --> 01:07:57.850
40 bucks you got,

01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.162
40 bucks worth you get.

01:08:11.680 --> 01:08:13.603
Steady as a rock...

01:08:15.720 --> 01:08:17.609
once I'm prepped.

01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:40.846
40 bucks got you the bullet.

01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.805
But that hand of yours,

01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:47.611
that's a lot of bones need setting.

01:08:49.040 --> 01:08:50.962
I'll give you an hour

01:08:51.120 --> 01:08:52.804
for your shoes.

01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.450
Take them.

01:09:00.760 --> 01:09:03.604
<i>I do my best to think about winning...</i>

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:04.807
<i>Revenge.</i>

01:09:06.640 --> 01:09:08.368
<i>The old man must like popsicles.</i>

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:11.251
<i>He uses the sticks for splints.</i>

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:12.970
<i>He licks them first.</i>

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:20.688
Not so much as a goddamn thank you.

01:09:20.880 --> 01:09:23.611
Generosity don't count for shit, this...

01:09:24.479 --> 01:09:25.925
day and age.

01:09:26.560 --> 01:09:28.403
<i>Quite a job you did on me, Roark.</i>

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.082
<i>Even my shoes.</i>

01:09:31.240 --> 01:09:33.207
<i>There's nothing more you could take,</i>

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:35.125
<i>except...</i>

01:09:35.880 --> 01:09:37.006
<i>Marcie.</i>

01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:38.890
<i>The girl.</i>

01:09:39.479 --> 01:09:41.084
<i>Oh, my Christ.</i>

01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:45.484
<i>Marcie.</i>

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.569
<i>Oh, Marcie, you weren't a part of this.</i>

01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:52.883
<i>You were just there
to throw them off their game.</i>

01:09:53.120 --> 01:09:55.088
<i>What have I dragged you into?</i>

01:09:57.880 --> 01:10:01.202
<i>This has turned into a long, bad night.</i>

01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.610
<i>The window's not locked.</i>

01:10:08.640 --> 01:10:10.563
<i>Never a good sign.</i>

01:10:13.040 --> 01:10:15.042
<i>Not in Sin City.</i>

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.728
Look who decided to show up.

01:10:20.440 --> 01:10:22.283
Give the man a hand.

01:10:25.760 --> 01:10:27.922
Give the man another hand.

01:10:35.520 --> 01:10:38.649
Ruined, penniless, friendless and forgotten.

01:10:40.160 --> 01:10:42.845
You'd really be better off dead, Johnny.

01:10:51.720 --> 01:10:54.007
But I like you just the way you are.

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:03.845
<i>I got cocky.</i>

01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:07.490
<i>I got cocky, and I got Marcie dead.</i>

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:09.724
<i>Damn it, Johnny.</i>

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:12.527
<i>Hate yourself when you got the time.</i>

01:11:13.520 --> 01:11:15.170
<i>Think about tonight's game.</i>

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:18.003
<i>That's all that matters now.</i>

01:11:18.480 --> 01:11:19.766
<i>And all you need is money.</i>

01:11:19.960 --> 01:11:23.043
<i>Just one lousy buck would be enough
to get you started.</i>

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.725
Hello, ma'am.

01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:38.490
I don't have the money to pay,

01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:40.290
but could I ask you for a glass of water?

01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:42.125
Yeah.

01:11:43.160 --> 01:11:44.889
Times are tough all over.

01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:48.611
Thank you.

01:11:52.800 --> 01:11:53.881
What's with the hand?

01:11:56.520 --> 01:11:58.966
I beat the wrong guy at cards.

01:11:59.120 --> 01:12:00.246
Tough break.

01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:03.965
Thank you very much.

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:06.046
Just a second, you.

01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:10.049
You don't stink of anything I don't like,

01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:13.204
and you kind of remind me
of an old boyfriend, okay?

01:12:17.880 --> 01:12:20.167
This won't take you very far.

01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:23.284
Sweetheart,

01:12:23.480 --> 01:12:24.891
it's gonna take me to the moon.

01:12:26.840 --> 01:12:30.322
<i>Sin City, you never know.</i>

01:12:34.040 --> 01:12:36.202
Just don't spend it all in one place.

01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.450
Hey, handsome.

01:12:46.600 --> 01:12:48.648
What you gonna do with all that?

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:51.250
I'm gonna kill Roark.

01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:54.085
The Roarks, they don't die that easy.

01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:56.242
I just might surprise you.

01:13:03.120 --> 01:13:05.930
Looks like something happened
to your game hand, son.

01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:20.564
I fold.

01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:22.529
What's wrong, hotshot?

01:13:22.720 --> 01:13:24.160
You're no good without that lady luck

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.009
you brought the last time?

01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:29.090
I'll be fine.

01:13:29.240 --> 01:13:30.446
I'm done.

01:13:30.600 --> 01:13:31.806
I'm out.

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:42.840
I need three.

01:13:46.480 --> 01:13:48.209
Dealer takes two.

01:13:48.720 --> 01:13:50.768
- Check.
- Check.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:53.529
I bet 100.

01:13:55.800 --> 01:13:57.325
Shit.

01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:00.486
Fold.

01:14:08.240 --> 01:14:11.369
Just not the same
without your game hand, is it?

01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:22.969
I'm ambidextrous.

01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:25.365
Cut.

01:14:33.160 --> 01:14:35.083
- Check.
- Check.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.850
500.

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.649
I'm in.

01:14:44.600 --> 01:14:46.250
I'll raise you...

01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:49.730
500 more.

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.441
I fold.

01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:55.011
I'm done.

01:14:58.440 --> 01:15:00.488
I'll raise you five more, pretty boy.

01:15:01.040 --> 01:15:02.166
Shit.

01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.764
You favor your mother.

01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:06.285
She was a whore.

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.443
Not a very good one.

01:15:09.240 --> 01:15:10.730
She was an angel.

01:15:12.480 --> 01:15:13.766
I'm all in.

01:15:13.920 --> 01:15:15.410
For the works.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.766
Call.

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.249
That's four aces.

01:15:47.320 --> 01:15:49.288
See, I told you I never lose.

01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:52.530
I beat you.

01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.001
Twice.

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:56.162
That means I'm better than you are,

01:15:56.600 --> 01:15:58.921
and everybody knows it,
'cause I beat you again

01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:00.520
every time somebody tells that story,

01:16:00.640 --> 01:16:02.449
and they'll all say
that they won't tell it,

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:03.567
but they will.

01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:05.210
That's a story that'll be told

01:16:05.360 --> 01:16:07.203
again and again until you're dead,

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:09.408
and long after you're dead.

01:16:10.040 --> 01:16:11.724
I beat you forever.

01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.361
Now they'll all know
what happens when you do.

01:16:16.600 --> 01:16:18.409
Say hello to your mama.

01:16:18.680 --> 01:16:20.523
She always was a stupid bitch.

01:16:26.320 --> 01:16:28.322
Power is as power does.

01:16:30.120 --> 01:16:32.566
If I could give any young man advice,
it'd be this:

01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:34.165
wear a rubber.

01:16:34.360 --> 01:16:35.441
Now take out that trash.

01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.364
Let's get back to the game.

01:17:02.440 --> 01:17:04.124
<i>I can't lose you.</i>

01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:05.850
<i>Not again.</i>

01:17:06.240 --> 01:17:08.447
You'll never lose me, Nancy.

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:16.171
<i>All this time,</i>

01:17:16.360 --> 01:17:18.044
<i>she was right there.</i>

01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:20.603
<i>Dancing in the club
where you play poker.</i>

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:22.535
You've got to have been looking for a chance

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:25.484
to put this one through the wringer, Senator.

01:17:27.040 --> 01:17:29.361
Nancy Callahan.

01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:34.606
My son Ethan was killed because of her.

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:39.367
It's been four years now,
and still she's planting flowers

01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:40.965
at Hartigan's grave.

01:17:41.120 --> 01:17:42.326
She's showing gratitude,

01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:43.845
from the looks of it, to the cop.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.164
Gratitude to the cop
who ripped your son to pieces.

01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.401
<i>Hartigan turned my son into a freak.</i>

01:17:52.840 --> 01:17:53.921
<i>Well...</i>

01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:56.569
completed him as a freak.

01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.484
But I can hardly blame the young lady for...

01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.130
Obsession?

01:18:00.320 --> 01:18:02.129
Just let the little fluff drown
in her sorrow.

01:18:02.320 --> 01:18:03.924
It might not be that simple.

01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:08.171
Somehow she got her hands
on Hartigan's old pistol.

01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:17.204
<i>She hits the range every night
just before work.</i>

01:18:17.360 --> 01:18:18.964
<i>She's become quite a good shot.</i>

01:18:19.160 --> 01:18:20.321
<i>And I can only imagine</i>

01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:22.562
<i>whose face she sees on that target.</i>

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.561
I'm listening.

01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:28.888
She's been acting kind of crazy sometimes

01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:30.007
at work.

01:18:30.160 --> 01:18:31.605
<i>She's drinking.</i>

01:18:31.760 --> 01:18:33.569
<i>Just in the past few weeks.</i>

01:18:33.880 --> 01:18:35.405
<i>She never drank before.</i>

01:18:38.440 --> 01:18:41.444
<i>It's all like
she's building up to something.</i>

01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:46.371
<i>Maybe building her nerve.</i>

01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:49.049
That'll be all, Lieutenant.

01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:52.804
This little bitch is turning me on.

01:19:00.400 --> 01:19:02.084
<i>This place stinks.</i>

01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:04.929
<i>I never used to notice.</i>

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:07.729
<i>Not when I danced.</i>

01:19:09.760 --> 01:19:12.047
<i>Now I smell everything.</i>

01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:15.006
<i>I see it all.</i>

01:19:16.480 --> 01:19:18.562
<i>Every damn thing.</i>

01:19:19.840 --> 01:19:21.808
<i>I know exactly where I am.</i>

01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:24.531
<i>I know exactly what I am.</i>

01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.887
<i>I don't use the stripper logic any more,</i>

01:19:27.760 --> 01:19:30.445
<i>that they're losers and I'm not.</i>

01:19:31.800 --> 01:19:35.122
<i>It was when I couldn't shoot him
that I realized I was dead.</i>

01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:39.080
<i>That I wasn't a woman with a plan.</i>

01:19:42.760 --> 01:19:45.127
<i>I was just a drunk.</i>

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.442
<i>I give them what they want.</i>

01:20:07.320 --> 01:20:09.288
<i>Then I get the hell out of there.</i>

01:20:28.880 --> 01:20:30.803
<i>Are you still there, Sam?</i>

01:20:33.280 --> 01:20:35.408
<i>He shot me in the gut.</i>

01:20:36.320 --> 01:20:37.810
<i>It wasn't me, Sam.</i>

01:20:38.400 --> 01:20:40.289
<i>It was the babe.</i>

01:20:41.560 --> 01:20:43.324
<i>Rotten town.</i>

01:20:43.520 --> 01:20:45.841
<i>It soils everybody it touches.</i>

01:20:47.120 --> 01:20:49.088
This rotten town.

01:20:49.960 --> 01:20:52.406
Those it can't corrupt, it soils.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.328
It's soiled you, John Hartigan.

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:02.728
Put that bottle down, Nancy.

01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:04.445
You've had enough.

01:21:07.080 --> 01:21:09.003
It made you lie to me.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.002
You're not even here right now.

01:21:15.640 --> 01:21:17.642
You said you'd never leave me.

01:21:18.320 --> 01:21:19.651
I never left you.

01:21:20.680 --> 01:21:22.170
I never will.

01:21:23.360 --> 01:21:24.566
Never.

01:21:25.640 --> 01:21:27.369
You're not even here right now.

01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:29.170
You're dead.

01:21:31.520 --> 01:21:33.204
You blew your brains out.

01:21:35.400 --> 01:21:39.803
Stuck your gun in your mouth
and you blew your brains out.

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:45.845
I had my reasons.

01:21:47.480 --> 01:21:49.130
There was no way out.

01:21:49.280 --> 01:21:50.805
I hate you!

01:21:54.280 --> 01:21:56.248
You swore you'd always love me.

01:21:57.160 --> 01:21:58.366
And I always will.

01:21:59.920 --> 01:22:02.400
<i>No one has ever really guessed
what hell is.</i>

01:22:03.600 --> 01:22:05.841
<i>It's watching the people you love...</i>

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.530
<i>in pain.</i>

01:22:17.160 --> 01:22:19.208
You're the only man I ever loved.

01:22:22.240 --> 01:22:24.163
And you left me alone.

01:22:31.560 --> 01:22:33.050
You never thought we'd stand a chance

01:22:33.200 --> 01:22:35.441
against goddamn Senator Roark.

01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:37.925
You didn't believe in me.

01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:42.411
You didn't think
a little piece of ass like me

01:22:42.600 --> 01:22:44.921
could take down
the most powerful man in the state.

01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.162
Maybe I'll prove both of you wrong.

01:23:02.760 --> 01:23:04.524
Maybe I'll go crazy.

01:23:11.400 --> 01:23:13.323
Crazy's sounding pretty good right now.

01:23:13.480 --> 01:23:15.289
I love you, Nancy.

01:23:32.560 --> 01:23:34.528
<i>You little slut.</i>

01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:38.727
<i>You're gonna scream before you die.</i>

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.363
You're out of your mind.

01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:49.290
I appreciate the obsession,

01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:52.203
but you got nothing.

01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:56.208
You could've killed me 50 times
if you had the nerve,

01:23:56.800 --> 01:23:58.290
but you don't.

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:04.327
You are nothing.

01:24:05.880 --> 01:24:07.211
You'll scream,

01:24:08.680 --> 01:24:10.842
just like my boy wanted you to.

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.769
Darling, where have you been and...

01:24:33.960 --> 01:24:36.327
What have you done to your beautiful hair?

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:39.324
Don't worry, those bastards
will get what they want.

01:24:41.160 --> 01:24:42.446
They always get what they want.

01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:09.845
This is great. This...

01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:12.044
What's up with you?

01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:23.330
Something's wrong.

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.126
I'm out of here.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.844
Don't like watching my sister
do the nasty.

01:25:41.040 --> 01:25:42.769
I'm taking a hike.

01:25:59.280 --> 01:26:00.691
Pretty.

01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:06.363
You're beautiful, Nancy.

01:26:08.920 --> 01:26:10.922
Don't do this to yourself.

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:16.165
Pretty, pretty, pretty.

01:26:20.360 --> 01:26:23.045
If a man did that to you,
I'd tear him to pieces.

01:26:25.080 --> 01:26:28.641
Lieutenant Hartigan,
you just gave me a great idea.

01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:36.290
No, baby.

01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:37.930
Nancy.

01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:12.162
Just give me a damn name.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:20.001
Roark.

01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:30.205
We're up against a lot.

01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.961
We'll need tools.

01:27:37.960 --> 01:27:39.485
Looks like trouble.

01:27:43.680 --> 01:27:45.523
Looks like Christmas.

01:27:49.240 --> 01:27:51.561
Well, you missed last call, boys.

01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:53.525
Bullshit.

01:27:53.680 --> 01:27:55.762
We're ripping this place a new asshole.

01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:58.650
Move or die.

01:28:50.360 --> 01:28:52.283
I hope you don't mind me saying this, but...

01:28:54.760 --> 01:28:56.330
you look hot.

01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:29.566
There's no reason to leave anybody alive.

01:29:29.840 --> 01:29:31.569
Nobody's innocent.

01:29:32.400 --> 01:29:34.971
And we can't leave anybody able to talk.

01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.929
Don't go soft on me, kid.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:39.484
Don't leave anybody breathing.

01:29:41.640 --> 01:29:43.085
I won't.

01:29:43.640 --> 01:29:46.246
I'll work the perimeter
and nail the guards.

01:29:46.440 --> 01:29:48.249
Baby, you're a natural.

01:29:48.440 --> 01:29:49.965
I'll work the inside.

01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:52.570
How will I know when you're in?

01:29:53.720 --> 01:29:55.290
You'll have a pretty good idea.

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.405
Damn thing misfired on me.

01:32:15.720 --> 01:32:17.131
I nearly got them all,

01:32:17.280 --> 01:32:20.921
but this piece of shit,
it was jammed up on me.

01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:23.483
Piece of crap Uzi

01:32:23.880 --> 01:32:25.564
had to get all stuck.

01:32:25.720 --> 01:32:27.006
Here.

01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:29.681
Take a seat.

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:38.930
You're a peach.

01:32:44.880 --> 01:32:46.370
I got this.

01:33:09.720 --> 01:33:12.121
You clever, clever little whore.

01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:14.682
I can't believe you made it this far.

01:33:18.640 --> 01:33:21.689
You know, Hartigan blew my son's pecker off.

01:33:22.720 --> 01:33:23.721
So...

01:33:24.840 --> 01:33:26.649
where shall I shoot you next?

01:33:30.120 --> 01:33:32.122
That tight little belly of yours?

01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:36.009
I'm holding a gun on you, young lady.

01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:39.801
The rules are, you pretend there's a chance
that I won't shoot you.

01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:54.170
I told you, you would scream
before you die.

01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:57.365
I owe it to my son.

01:34:01.560 --> 01:34:03.688
Frankly, between you and me,

01:34:03.840 --> 01:34:09.529
I've finally accepted that Ethan
was not presidential material.

01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:13.444
I'd have had a hard time

01:34:13.600 --> 01:34:16.206
buying him an election in an insane asylum.

01:34:20.360 --> 01:34:23.011
But he was my son, honey.

01:34:25.120 --> 01:34:26.610
He was my son.

01:34:29.720 --> 01:34:31.324
And now...

01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.004
he's gonna hear you scream.

01:34:39.080 --> 01:34:41.003
Scream.

01:35:11.240 --> 01:35:13.971
This is for John Hartigan, fucker.

01:35:18.240 --> 01:35:20.163
<i>This rotten town.</i>

01:35:20.920 --> 01:35:22.649
<i>It soils everybody.</i>

01:35:23.305 --> 01:35:29.557
