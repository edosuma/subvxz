<i>Once upon a time...</i>

00:21.736 --> 00:25.006
<i>...or so the story has been told...</i>

00:27.576 --> 00:30.810
<i>...a boy became acquainted
to a life under water.</i>

00:50.365 --> 00:53.766
<i>Or as the locals would tell you...</i>

00:53.768 --> 00:56.838
<i>...a boy became a fish.</i>

00:58.073 --> 01:01.076
<i>The boy came from
an average suburb...</i>

01:02.744 --> 01:05.581
<i>...of a great American city.</i>

01:06.948 --> 01:09.115
<i>While other kids played typical</i>

01:09.117 --> 01:10.850
<i>childhood games...</i>

01:10.852 --> 01:13.119
<i>...our boy was holding his breath.</i>

01:15.724 --> 01:18.894
<i>He held his breath everywhere.</i>

01:31.039 --> 01:33.806
<i>As the boy grew...</i>

01:33.808 --> 01:36.076
<i>...he dazzled all the town's people</i>

01:36.078 --> 01:38.914
<i>with his spectacular ability.</i>

02:31.066 --> 02:33.699
<i>And his legend grew.</i>

02:41.977 --> 02:46.179
<i>The summer before he was
to go off into the world...</i>

02:46.181 --> 02:50.149
<i>...the town's people pled for
him to showcase his talents</i>

02:50.151 --> 02:54.186
<i>one final time.</i>

03:09.270 --> 03:11.971
Now, ladies and gentlemen

03:11.973 --> 03:13.639
boys and girls

03:13.641 --> 03:15.274
I give you...

03:15.276 --> 03:17.911
...The Submarine Kid.

03:34.162 --> 03:37.030
<i>This was his final
goodbye to the town</i>

03:37.032 --> 03:39.965
<i>before entering the real world</i>

03:39.967 --> 03:42.102
<i>of endless responsibilities</i>

03:42.104 --> 03:45.341
<i>and tedious obligation.</i>

04:40.795 --> 04:43.262
<i>As the minutes grew longer</i>

04:43.264 --> 04:46.168
<i>the people got nervous.</i>

04:53.608 --> 04:55.742
<i>But those closest to him</i>

04:55.744 --> 04:57.877
<i>assured the rest of the crowd</i>

04:57.879 --> 05:02.584
<i>that this was all part
of his grand exhibition.</i>

05:08.023 --> 05:10.957
<i>But doubts was creeping in.</i>

05:23.105 --> 05:27.007
<i>As the clock turned to 20
minutes past the hour...</i>

05:27.009 --> 05:29.142
<i>...even the ones who knew him best</i>

05:29.144 --> 05:31.680
<i>started to panic.</i>

05:35.250 --> 05:38.754
<i>His girl was the first to
break away from the crowd...</i>

05:43.024 --> 05:45.259
<i>...to search.</i>

06:02.677 --> 06:05.213
<i>They all searched...</i>

06:11.887 --> 06:14.423
<i>...and searched...</i>

06:18.259 --> 06:20.762
<i>...and searched.</i>

06:24.966 --> 06:28.470
<i>And they're still searching...</i>

06:29.971 --> 06:32.540
<i>...to this day.</i>

06:53.728 --> 06:55.463
Oh.

07:00.968 --> 07:03.204
He's here.

07:04.973 --> 07:06.072
Oh.

07:07.141 --> 07:10.043
There he is.

07:10.045 --> 07:13.445
Oh, look at you.

07:13.447 --> 07:15.447
- Welcome home, son.
- Oh, Josh, careful, careful.

07:15.449 --> 07:17.517
Ah, he's fine. He looks
great. He looks great.

07:17.519 --> 07:19.385
Oh, honey, we missed you so much.

07:19.387 --> 07:20.986
- We would have come to get you.
- I know.

07:20.988 --> 07:22.288
Well, why didn't you want
us to come to get you?

07:22.290 --> 07:24.793
Come on, sweetheart. Come on.

07:26.360 --> 07:29.230
What's up, dingleberry?

07:40.975 --> 07:44.278
- Hi.
- Hey, you.

07:50.017 --> 07:52.520
I love you.

08:29.591 --> 08:32.525
I told your mom not to clean too much.

08:32.527 --> 08:35.563
I know how you like for
things to stay the same.

08:41.135 --> 08:42.669
Hmm.

09:02.624 --> 09:06.859
Spencer, Emily, dinner!

09:06.861 --> 09:08.594
But that's what I keep telling him.

09:08.596 --> 09:10.363
Uh, well, I am just glad that he's home

09:10.365 --> 09:11.430
so we get to see you more.

09:11.432 --> 09:13.366
Hmm, well, that's the real reason

09:13.368 --> 09:14.499
why I wanted him to come home

09:14.501 --> 09:16.201
so I could hang out with you guys.

09:16.203 --> 09:18.537
So, Spence, you must be
ready to get back to shop.

09:18.539 --> 09:20.339
You know, if he was a girl
we were gonna name him Emily.

09:20.341 --> 09:22.074
- Ran into Marc the other day.
- Really?

09:22.076 --> 09:23.910
He said he could use some help down there.

09:25.113 --> 09:27.379
Who is it, honey?

09:27.381 --> 09:28.647
Just the guys.

09:28.649 --> 09:30.949
Oh, the rat pack.

09:34.389 --> 09:37.323
I think you should answer it.

09:37.325 --> 09:39.191
- Hey.
- Yo, dude!

09:39.193 --> 09:41.160
Hey, man.

09:41.162 --> 09:43.463
Yeah. I'm home.

09:43.465 --> 09:45.164
- Oh, Nathan's?
- No!

09:45.166 --> 09:47.233
Uh-huh, there was just
a shooting over there.

09:47.235 --> 09:49.167
Mom, he just got back from Afghanistan

09:49.169 --> 09:50.570
I think he can handle Echo Park.

09:50.572 --> 09:53.906
Uh, well, why don't
you guys just come here?

09:53.908 --> 09:55.208
Oh, okay, I'll ask her. Hey, mom...

09:55.210 --> 09:56.508
- No.
- Oh, yeah.

09:56.510 --> 09:58.111
She says, "Go fuck yourself, Mailer."

09:58.113 --> 09:59.545
- Ooh!
- Language. Language.

09:59.547 --> 10:01.480
Okay. Yeah, I don't
know, I-I'll let you know.

10:01.482 --> 10:03.651
Okay. Okay, bye.

10:05.687 --> 10:07.788
We should go.

10:09.124 --> 10:11.291
Okay.

10:11.293 --> 10:12.492
Then maybe later I can show you...

10:12.494 --> 10:14.227
I can go.

10:14.229 --> 10:16.362
Oh, that's right, you're of age.

10:16.364 --> 10:18.131
Well, why don't... You
don't have to go tonight.

10:18.133 --> 10:19.998
I mean you could see them anytime you want.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.969
You're back now... for good.

10:22.971 --> 10:25.405
How do you know that?

10:25.407 --> 10:27.073
What?

10:27.075 --> 10:28.541
I saw it on the news.

10:28.543 --> 10:30.276
Look, just-just don't
scare your brother, okay?

10:30.278 --> 10:31.544
- They're all back for good.
- Wait a minute.

10:31.546 --> 10:33.478
Cooper, you don't think that's true?

10:33.480 --> 10:35.013
Oh, stop it, Josh, of course it is.

10:35.015 --> 10:37.416
Three times was enough.

10:37.418 --> 10:39.685
They are not sending you back again.

10:39.687 --> 10:41.521
- I'm just sayin'...
- Spencer!

10:41.523 --> 10:43.825
Please will you tell your brother?

10:51.399 --> 10:54.334
Let's just go real quick.

10:54.336 --> 10:56.971
I wanna show you the
apartment, it's really cute.

11:00.508 --> 11:03.412
Uh... Let's just clean up here.

11:17.658 --> 11:20.560
I'll tell you what, if I had
been at the desert that long

11:20.562 --> 11:24.196
they'd have to tear me
away from your bedroom.

11:24.198 --> 11:27.566
I can't believe he's goin'
out with his friend's tonight.

11:27.568 --> 11:31.603
Hey, he's young, he
wants to see his buddies.

11:31.605 --> 11:34.073
- They can't send him back.
- No, they won't.

11:34.075 --> 11:35.474
- They can't do that to us.
- They won't, he's home.

11:35.476 --> 11:37.142
- He's fine, he said...
- But we don't know...

11:37.144 --> 11:38.544
Don't listen to Cooper, he doesn't know!

11:38.546 --> 11:40.546
- It's all rumors.
- We don't know.

11:40.548 --> 11:43.051
How can you know?

11:48.722 --> 11:51.959
Hey, um, can we have the keys?

11:53.260 --> 11:56.728
- Can't Emily take you?
- She's not going.

11:56.730 --> 11:58.464
That's good. See you later.

12:05.740 --> 12:08.608
Monogamy is an intellectual choice.

12:08.610 --> 12:10.243
Amen!

12:10.245 --> 12:13.412
We're all fucking animals,
okay? And that is my point.

12:13.414 --> 12:16.148
And if you think that you
have total self control...

12:16.150 --> 12:19.084
Hey, Paul, if you think that
you have total self control

12:19.086 --> 12:21.119
then... I don't know, man

12:21.121 --> 12:23.388
your girlfriend probably fucking hates you.

12:23.390 --> 12:26.358
Doesn't matter to me 'cause
Imma be fucking her either way.

12:26.360 --> 12:28.060
- You're an idiot.
- Hey.

12:28.062 --> 12:30.363
Yo, fuck me, little brother.

12:30.365 --> 12:32.297
All grown up and shit.

12:32.299 --> 12:35.100
'Sup, Howie. Where's Toad?

12:35.102 --> 12:37.170
- Everything set?
- How's your mom doing, Coop?

12:37.172 --> 12:40.373
- Uh, fine.
- See, perfect example.

12:40.375 --> 12:42.374
You think his mom doesn't have
self-control, you're a dumbass.

12:42.376 --> 12:44.410
She's been ignoring your
little dick for years.

12:44.412 --> 12:47.313
Yeah, well, you gotta put in the 50 years

12:47.315 --> 12:49.581
if you wanna get the gold watch.

12:49.583 --> 12:52.618
I mean think about how many of
us have rocked their hurricane

12:52.620 --> 12:55.088
with Darla over there.

12:55.090 --> 12:56.656
See, that is my point exactly.

12:56.658 --> 12:59.658
We are not built to put
our seed in just one garden.

12:59.660 --> 13:02.195
What does, uh, "Garden"
refer to in this context?

13:02.197 --> 13:05.230
What the fuck do you think
"Garden" refers to, dude?

13:05.232 --> 13:06.465
Garden!

13:06.467 --> 13:08.868
Garden, vagina, garden, okay?

13:08.870 --> 13:10.603
And if you think a woman
doesn't have a libido

13:10.605 --> 13:13.573
then you, my friend,
are the fucking dumbass.

13:13.575 --> 13:15.474
When's the last time you used your libido?

13:16.510 --> 13:18.377
What's up, puberty?

13:18.379 --> 13:20.546
Big brother comes home, think
you can join the conversation?

13:20.548 --> 13:22.581
Don't pick on him,
Mailer, you fucking bully.

13:24.852 --> 13:26.719
There he is.

13:26.721 --> 13:29.224
Get over here, get over here.

13:30.591 --> 13:33.658
Spencer, you jarhead dick Jake Gyllenhaal

13:33.660 --> 13:36.496
motherfucker, what's up?

13:36.498 --> 13:38.263
Alright... clink, bitches.

13:38.265 --> 13:40.867
- Clink.
- Clink it up!

13:40.869 --> 13:43.536
Hmm.

13:43.538 --> 13:46.238
- Yeah.
- Oh, you are ripped, dude.

13:46.240 --> 13:47.806
Ah, I could still take him.

13:47.808 --> 13:50.542
Back on base, I got into
fight with these two rednecks.

13:50.544 --> 13:51.877
Could've used you.

13:51.879 --> 13:54.749
Man, I wish I was there.
I could have translated.

13:55.817 --> 13:59.185
So, uh, you're for good,
or... you're going back?

13:59.187 --> 14:01.153
We'll see.

14:01.155 --> 14:02.254
Hmm.

14:09.464 --> 14:12.464
- I'm here right now.
- Yes, you fucking are.

14:12.466 --> 14:14.867
To our hero who's back... to stay.

14:14.869 --> 14:18.371
Hey, hey, we're have a
true-blooded, whisky-drinkin'

14:18.373 --> 14:21.541
turban-chasin', son of America right here.

14:21.543 --> 14:24.509
Line up and pay your
respects. Buy this man a beer!

14:24.511 --> 14:27.546
- Just sit down, sit down.
- Buy me a beer too.

14:27.548 --> 14:29.348
I can see nothing's changed.

14:29.350 --> 14:30.949
Uh, where's Toad?

14:30.951 --> 14:33.786
Oh, dude, Toad, he's
fucking pissed at you, dude.

14:33.788 --> 14:35.820
For not callin' him, he's pissed!

14:35.822 --> 14:37.690
Yeah, he's been whining about it all day.

14:37.692 --> 14:40.392
He's been acting weird lately.
He knew you were comin' back.

14:40.394 --> 14:42.795
- So...
- So he left?

14:42.797 --> 14:44.796
Spencer, have-have you talked with Toad?

14:44.798 --> 14:47.901
I'm not sure he wants to see you, buddy.

14:49.370 --> 14:51.436
Yeah, but Toad's a fucking
sensitive vagina, man.

14:51.438 --> 14:53.772
Let's go in the back, let's
fucking forget about it.

14:53.774 --> 14:55.541
I don't know if I'm in the mood.

14:55.543 --> 14:59.380
What, you'd take down a sheikh
and now you don't party no more?

15:00.447 --> 15:02.480
- Fine.
- Yeah!

15:02.482 --> 15:04.282
That's more like it.

15:04.284 --> 15:06.752
- Dead man walking!
- Let's go, come on.

15:06.754 --> 15:09.354
I can't believe fuckin' Toad isn't here.

15:09.356 --> 15:11.860
Are you gonna bitch about this all night?

15:14.962 --> 15:16.695
Should have called us more, man.

15:16.697 --> 15:18.797
Yeah. What, we're not good
enough for you, Spence?

15:18.799 --> 15:20.498
It's like his third time by

15:20.500 --> 15:22.969
how am I suppose to keep
getting hyped up for this shit?

15:28.643 --> 15:31.344
Why didn't you call me, you asshole?

15:31.346 --> 15:33.278
Fuck you all.

15:33.280 --> 15:34.814
He was so damn sad.

15:34.816 --> 15:37.449
I can't wait to tell
Emily how dumped you were.

15:37.451 --> 15:38.917
Man, you wanna play with the winner?

15:38.919 --> 15:41.686
I don't see a winner around.
I guess I'll play with you.

15:41.688 --> 15:43.955
It's good to see you. Ah!

15:43.957 --> 15:46.758
- No!
- What?

15:46.760 --> 15:49.728
- Back again, boogers!
- Yes!

16:42.616 --> 16:44.852
Take the shot.

16:46.754 --> 16:49.622
Spencer, take the shot!

16:49.624 --> 16:51.690
Talon to 1-1, take the shot.

16:51.692 --> 16:53.658
Take the shot.

16:53.660 --> 16:56.029
Take the shot, dude!

16:57.631 --> 16:59.464
Take the shot!

16:59.466 --> 17:01.434
- Take the shot!
- Take the shot!

17:01.436 --> 17:02.600
- Take the shot!
- Take the shot!

17:06.441 --> 17:09.040
- Yes! In your face.
- Whoa!

18:02.130 --> 18:03.929
Hey!

18:03.931 --> 18:06.498
There he is.

18:06.500 --> 18:07.799
Look at you.

18:07.801 --> 18:09.336
Hey.

18:18.179 --> 18:20.478
So you're back?

18:20.480 --> 18:22.317
I'm back.

18:23.817 --> 18:25.918
Let's see that badge of courage.

18:25.920 --> 18:27.786
- No.
- Come on.

18:27.788 --> 18:30.290
Who gives a fuck?

18:33.126 --> 18:35.230
Alright, fine.

18:39.767 --> 18:42.303
Yeah, that's a good one.

18:43.871 --> 18:46.374
You're damn lucky.

18:49.477 --> 18:50.809
Hey, you know that.

18:50.811 --> 18:52.844
So, uh, you need a little help around here?

18:52.846 --> 18:56.047
Yeah, yeah.

18:56.049 --> 18:58.116
I'm trying to, uh...

18:58.118 --> 19:01.388
...pull a few tricks to
get the business on track.

19:02.589 --> 19:05.090
You know, this is a good
opportunity for you here.

19:05.092 --> 19:08.026
- How long are you back?
- I don't know.

19:08.028 --> 19:11.529
They say for good, but
that's probably bullshit.

19:11.531 --> 19:14.933
I'd love for you to put in
some time here, you know.

19:14.935 --> 19:18.703
Give you a chance to be a
part of a growing business.

19:18.705 --> 19:20.038
Really?

19:20.040 --> 19:22.842
Well, like I said there's a chance.

19:22.844 --> 19:25.510
You've seen what the
neighborhood's turning into

19:25.512 --> 19:28.581
and a new hip boutique pops up every day.

19:28.583 --> 19:30.149
I gotta capitalize on this, right?

19:30.151 --> 19:34.186
Because nostalgia is the new cool.

19:34.188 --> 19:37.890
But only to a point apparently.

19:37.892 --> 19:40.492
- So no one's comin' in?
- Exactly.

19:40.494 --> 19:41.960
You know, I gotta make people feel

19:41.962 --> 19:45.597
like they're-they're not
walking into a dungeon...

19:45.599 --> 19:47.967
...or, or...

19:47.969 --> 19:50.201
...if they are walking into a dungeon

19:50.203 --> 19:53.572
it's gotta be a cool
fucking dungeon, doesn't it?

19:53.574 --> 19:55.106
Improvise, adapt and overcome.

19:55.108 --> 19:56.941
Hoo-rah!

19:56.943 --> 20:01.048
Frankly, my, uh, my pockets are dryin' up.

20:02.083 --> 20:04.283
I need a new sign for starters.

20:04.285 --> 20:06.919
You know, somethin'
they actually look up to

20:06.921 --> 20:08.286
from their phones.

20:08.288 --> 20:10.623
I could do that.

20:10.625 --> 20:12.160
Fantastic.

20:13.294 --> 20:16.528
This is gonna be good for you. Believe me.

20:16.530 --> 20:19.200
You know, idle hands and all that shit.

20:21.301 --> 20:23.268
Can you start now?

20:31.846 --> 20:34.546
Imma take this order to the post office.

20:34.548 --> 20:37.850
Can you watch the shop
in case someone comes in?

20:37.852 --> 20:39.919
Yeah, sure.

20:39.921 --> 20:41.886
I'm gettin' some chow. You want somethin'?

20:41.888 --> 20:43.822
No, I'm good.

20:43.824 --> 20:46.057
Alright then.

20:46.059 --> 20:48.562
I'll leave you to it.

22:01.335 --> 22:03.067
Hi.

22:03.069 --> 22:04.370
Hi.

22:04.372 --> 22:06.939
Do you, uh, do you work here?

22:06.941 --> 22:09.007
Um, yeah.

22:09.009 --> 22:12.143
Uh, do you possibly have any

22:12.145 --> 22:15.648
old newspapers, magazines?

22:15.650 --> 22:16.849
That kinda stuff?

22:16.851 --> 22:18.283
Um...

22:18.285 --> 22:21.719
...I'm sure there are
something like that around here.

22:21.721 --> 22:24.558
Well, we have to find the right pile.

22:26.326 --> 22:28.360
I know you.

22:28.362 --> 22:31.296
I, I saw that article

22:31.298 --> 22:33.164
about you in the paper.

22:33.166 --> 22:35.366
I remember your picture.

22:35.368 --> 22:36.735
- Yeah.
- So...

22:36.737 --> 22:39.171
You guys all done over there?

22:39.173 --> 22:42.674
Shot the bad guy and everything?

22:42.676 --> 22:44.075
Something like that.

22:44.077 --> 22:47.379
Well, glad to see you're back in one piece.

22:47.381 --> 22:50.118
I just got here myself.

22:51.719 --> 22:54.318
I'm Spencer.

22:54.320 --> 22:55.353
Alice.

22:55.355 --> 22:57.789
- Alice?
- Yeah.

22:57.791 --> 23:00.324
Yeah.

23:00.326 --> 23:03.194
Uh, yeah, sorry, I wish I
knew where that stuff was

23:03.196 --> 23:05.866
I really just started here today.

23:06.901 --> 23:09.101
Doing maintenance mostly.

23:09.103 --> 23:12.171
I'm gonna build a new sign for the front.

23:12.173 --> 23:17.075
Probably fix the whole Dewey
Decimal situation in here.

23:18.144 --> 23:19.444
The guy who owns the place is out

23:19.446 --> 23:21.279
but he should be back pretty soon, so...

23:21.281 --> 23:23.315
Maybe I'll just...

23:23.317 --> 23:26.852
...poke around and see if
I can find something useful.

23:26.854 --> 23:28.556
Yeah.

23:49.777 --> 23:51.943
The... These are perfect.

23:51.945 --> 23:54.747
Oh, good.

23:54.749 --> 23:58.449
You know like a... school
project or something?

23:58.451 --> 24:04.256
Uh, no, I'm just tryin' to
find some images for a new book.

24:04.258 --> 24:06.091
Oh. You're a writer?

24:06.093 --> 24:10.161
Hmm, not exactly, it's
more like a scrapbook.

24:10.163 --> 24:12.898
I've been scavenging for material.

24:12.900 --> 24:14.967
So are you like in the
scrapbooking business?

24:14.969 --> 24:18.336
Oh, no, I was working at
a pet store for a while.

24:18.338 --> 24:19.971
They were jerks.

24:19.973 --> 24:22.341
There comes a point
where you just have to...

24:22.343 --> 24:25.477
...break away and follow your dreams.

24:25.479 --> 24:27.513
That's probably true.

24:27.515 --> 24:32.151
I mean if you find
something you really love.

24:32.153 --> 24:34.689
- Right?
- Right.

24:37.290 --> 24:40.528
So what do you love, Spencer?

24:43.029 --> 24:45.163
Uh, wha...

24:45.165 --> 24:48.065
I-I'm just asking, like...

24:48.067 --> 24:50.803
- Do you love bein' a soldier?
- Marines, it's a bit different.

24:50.805 --> 24:52.371
I don't know about that stuff.

24:52.373 --> 24:54.305
Isn't it like you go
to school though, or...

24:54.307 --> 24:57.276
If I wanted that, I guess, yeah.

24:57.278 --> 25:01.013
Well, then w-why join?

25:01.015 --> 25:04.349
I mean why-why go away?

25:04.351 --> 25:06.051
Honestly?

25:06.053 --> 25:07.920
Everyone's always asking
you what you wanna do?

25:07.922 --> 25:10.154
What you wanna make?

25:10.156 --> 25:12.056
The Marine Corp just gives you that.

25:12.058 --> 25:14.860
You don't have to think about it.

25:14.862 --> 25:16.161
It's not your decision
when you're a part of

25:16.163 --> 25:18.063
something bigger.

25:18.065 --> 25:22.567
Well, being a part of something bigger...

25:22.569 --> 25:26.103
...doesn't make it better.

25:26.105 --> 25:28.909
You know that, right?

25:31.045 --> 25:34.513
Is that how you convince
yourself to leave the pet store?

25:34.515 --> 25:37.516
Oh, no, I...

25:37.518 --> 25:40.952
I got fired because I hate cats.

25:44.224 --> 25:46.057
- Yeah.
- You know something?

25:46.059 --> 25:48.192
- Hmm?
- I hate cats.

25:48.194 --> 25:49.393
Really?

25:49.395 --> 25:51.196
They're horrible. They're so mean.

25:51.198 --> 25:52.530
- Angry.
- They scratch me. They...

25:52.532 --> 25:54.266
- Generally unpleasant and...
- Horrible.

25:54.268 --> 25:57.102
Wait, my parents had this giant cat

25:57.104 --> 25:59.071
just would look at me and urgh... horrible.

25:59.073 --> 26:02.310
My girlfriend has two, and they just...

26:05.645 --> 26:09.046
Well... uh... I...

26:09.048 --> 26:12.653
I-I guess I'll just, uh, I'll take these.

27:12.479 --> 27:16.081
Much better than the
first night, Mr. Drunkie.

27:22.189 --> 27:24.690
I need to go.

27:24.692 --> 27:26.691
Hey.

27:26.693 --> 27:28.492
I don't care about the other night

27:28.494 --> 27:30.764
I was just joking.

27:34.335 --> 27:37.335
Don't you have work?

27:37.337 --> 27:40.607
Yeah, but we can at least
have breakfast together.

27:45.112 --> 27:47.615
I need to get to the shop.

27:53.453 --> 27:54.989
Spencer...

27:57.191 --> 27:59.123
...I've waited like...

27:59.125 --> 28:02.594
...three years to wake up next to you

28:02.596 --> 28:06.800
and eat breakfast with you in our place.

28:08.602 --> 28:11.202
This is our new life.

28:11.204 --> 28:13.671
It's finally here.

28:13.673 --> 28:16.208
I wanted that too.

28:16.210 --> 28:18.711
You don't want this anymore?

28:20.614 --> 28:23.517
You wanted this the
last time you were back.

28:25.652 --> 28:28.719
Don't do this to me.

28:28.721 --> 28:31.826
Okay, I'm doing the
best that I can. Just...

28:33.027 --> 28:36.594
Just talk to me please.

28:36.596 --> 28:39.098
I don't wanna do this.

28:49.410 --> 28:51.242
- What do I owe ya?
- No, no, no, come on.

28:51.244 --> 28:53.478
You fight for freedom, I
serve organic eggs to hipsters

28:53.480 --> 28:55.180
I'm buying you breakfast.

28:55.182 --> 28:58.018
Yours is a nobler profession I promise.

29:01.688 --> 29:03.788
There's a party this evening,
your presence is required.

29:03.790 --> 29:05.390
I don't know, man.

29:05.392 --> 29:07.225
No, but your presence is required, alright?

29:07.227 --> 29:08.526
Mailer fucked this rich chick

29:08.528 --> 29:10.161
she wants his balls again, we're goin'.

29:10.163 --> 29:12.096
- Okay?
- Can I get back to you?

29:12.098 --> 29:14.601
Only with a yes.

29:19.105 --> 29:21.405
I thought that would take you a week.

29:21.407 --> 29:23.441
I gotta find some other
shit for you to do now.

29:23.443 --> 29:25.677
Maybe we could organize the books.

29:25.679 --> 29:28.182
Don't get too ambitious.

29:30.550 --> 29:32.150
I'm gonna take a quick break.

29:32.152 --> 29:35.353
Yeah, well, you've earned it.

30:23.636 --> 30:25.836
Hey.

30:25.838 --> 30:28.440
- Hey!
- I-I didn't mean to scare you.

30:28.442 --> 30:31.509
That's okay, I...

30:31.511 --> 30:35.613
Well, I just wanted to
say I saw the new sign.

30:35.615 --> 30:38.382
Looks really great.

30:38.384 --> 30:39.484
Caught my eye.

30:39.486 --> 30:41.686
Thanks!

30:41.688 --> 30:45.157
That's the hope.

30:45.159 --> 30:47.859
I thought it never rained here.

30:47.861 --> 30:50.394
That's just not true, transplant.

30:50.396 --> 30:52.363
Well, it should be.

30:52.365 --> 30:54.365
I pinned you for some Virginia Woolf fan

30:54.367 --> 30:56.903
who loves the gloomy whether.

30:58.172 --> 30:59.336
You are so...

30:59.338 --> 31:01.841
Come on in, I'm just closing up.

31:12.352 --> 31:14.688
I'm so what?

31:16.623 --> 31:18.923
I don't know.

31:18.925 --> 31:21.359
I don't know what you are.

31:35.709 --> 31:38.977
Oh, damn it.

31:38.979 --> 31:40.277
What?

31:40.279 --> 31:42.948
It's just a little bit of weather.

31:42.950 --> 31:45.717
I'm supposed to go to a party.

31:45.719 --> 31:48.687
Oh, well, don't let me keep you.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.221
It's at a mansion.

31:50.223 --> 31:53.424
The Texan will be in top form.

31:53.426 --> 31:56.929
- The Texan?
- You'll meet him.

32:02.803 --> 32:05.039
Goodnight, Spencer.

32:06.807 --> 32:09.308
Do you wanna meet him now?

32:17.884 --> 32:21.288
- What about your...
- We're on a break.

32:22.521 --> 32:26.658
So that means you can take
other girls to parties?

33:03.329 --> 33:05.330
Hey, Howie, go grab that
guy's bow-tie right there.

33:05.332 --> 33:09.002
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey, Marc Blanc.

33:10.569 --> 33:11.936
Masters of the evening...

33:11.938 --> 33:14.372
...this is Mr. Spencer Koll.

33:14.374 --> 33:16.775
Heads-up with the wardrobe
would have been nice.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.442
This place is fucking crazy, right?

33:18.444 --> 33:19.811
Yeah, who do we know here?

33:19.813 --> 33:21.746
Oh, uh, Mailer's second cousin's godfather

33:21.748 --> 33:23.448
knows the guy who owns this place.

33:23.450 --> 33:25.717
- Okay, and you hooked up with...
- That guy's daughter.

33:25.719 --> 33:27.419
Yeah, it was awesome.

33:27.421 --> 33:31.021
I got it. The little bitch
is crying in the corner.

33:31.023 --> 33:33.458
- This is Howie from Texas.
- Hello.

33:33.460 --> 33:35.759
All the guys say I'm a stereotype of myself

33:35.761 --> 33:37.528
or whatever the fuck that means?

33:37.530 --> 33:40.065
Yes, we're all very proud
of our resident moron here.

33:40.067 --> 33:42.066
Uh, pot, kettle, kettle, pot.

33:42.068 --> 33:43.735
Eat my shit, Paul.

33:44.971 --> 33:47.639
Spencer, I'm wearing a tie.

33:47.641 --> 33:50.642
You might as well call
me a pussy vandal tonight.

33:51.912 --> 33:54.914
Okay, settle down, champ, huh.

33:55.981 --> 33:58.949
There is only coke in this coke.

33:58.951 --> 34:00.818
Blasphemy!

34:02.923 --> 34:05.724
Spencer, this is Stephanie. Stephanie...

34:05.726 --> 34:07.359
- Hey!
- What's up?

34:07.361 --> 34:08.958
- Guys, this is...
- Alright, everybody.

34:08.960 --> 34:10.362
Can we make a little bit of a moment here?

34:10.364 --> 34:12.063
Can we raise our glasses

34:12.065 --> 34:13.398
to the air

34:13.400 --> 34:14.833
and can we clink it up, bitches.

35:16.996 --> 35:19.063
Alright.

35:19.065 --> 35:20.965
What?

35:20.967 --> 35:23.467
What did you say this
chick's name was again?

35:23.469 --> 35:27.106
- Alice.
- Alice, okay. Alice.

35:28.474 --> 35:30.941
Well, if this is something
that you think you need...

35:30.943 --> 35:32.510
...Spencer...

35:32.512 --> 35:34.545
...fucking go for it. Do it.

Nobody knows better than you.

35:36.483 --> 35:38.816
Emily was your perfect girl...

35:38.818 --> 35:41.686
...this stuff is different.

35:41.688 --> 35:43.987
I mean you can't be nice all of your life.

35:43.989 --> 35:46.191
And if this feels real,
you might as well follow it.

35:46.193 --> 35:47.724
Go for it.

35:47.726 --> 35:49.059
I mean that's what you always said to us.

35:49.061 --> 35:50.094
"Just follow what's real."

35:50.096 --> 35:54.199
Well... real isn't always nice.

Oh, "Thunder Lake."

38:15.240 --> 38:17.809

A boy became acquainted

47:01.567 --> 47:04.670
I've been coming here for 20 summers.

47:07.440 --> 47:09.874
It's just...

47:09.876 --> 47:12.510
...always felt like the place where I'm...

47:12.512 --> 47:14.881
...supposed to be.

47:16.382 --> 47:18.414
I can feel that.

47:18.416 --> 47:20.450
It's, uh...

47:20.452 --> 47:22.418
It's comforting.

47:22.420 --> 47:24.487
Yeah. See, and you've only
been here for 30 seconds.

47:24.489 --> 47:27.557
Yeah, it's comforting and...

47:27.559 --> 47:31.663
...I don't know, I just always
felt drawn to this place.

47:33.932 --> 47:36.768

47:48.181 --> 47:49.949
Okay.

47:51.717 --> 47:54.220
I'm ready for that.

48:29.989 --> 48:31.755
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

48:31.757 --> 48:34.525
Holy crap! That was amazing!

48:34.527 --> 48:35.659

53:24.016 --> 53:26.717

53:26.719 --> 53:29.019

- Baby.

53:29.021 --> 53:32.121
Hey, Spencer, I'm Doctor Fisk.

53:32.123 --> 53:33.557
I want you to take it easy.

53:33.559 --> 53:36.062
I don't want you to say anything now.

53:37.795 --> 53:39.896
You were in that water
there for quite a bit.

53:39.898 --> 53:41.597
You had a near drowning.

53:41.599 --> 53:43.900
It appears you aspirated
a pretty significant

53:43.902 --> 53:46.869
amount of water that was very cold.

53:46.871 --> 53:49.039
<i>And we're fortunate that
your body has been trained up</i>

53:49.041 --> 53:51.544
<i>in that sort of thing.</i>

53:53.278 --> 53:57.780
So I just want to ask
you a couple of questions.

53:57.782 --> 54:00.117
What's your name?

54:00.119 --> 54:01.918
Spencer Koll.

54:01.920 --> 54:04.921
Do you know what the date is?

54:04.923 --> 54:07.624
Thursday, I'm not really sure.

54:07.626 --> 54:10.760
Do you know what month it is?

54:10.762 --> 54:12.028
- June.
- Good.

54:12.030 --> 54:14.030
Who is the President?

54:14.032 --> 54:15.798
Obama.

54:15.800 --> 54:17.733
I think you're gonna do just fine.

54:17.735 --> 54:19.101
I do wanna keep you here

54:19.103 --> 54:20.903
for just a tad longer though, okay, bud?

54:20.905 --> 54:22.204
I wanna keep an eye on the lungs

54:22.206 --> 54:23.673
I wanna do some respiratory monitoring

54:23.675 --> 54:26.177
and then we'll let you go.

54:31.349 --> 54:33.115
- Where is...
- She'll be down in a minute.

54:33.117 --> 54:37.019
The other nurses let her
know you're here. It's okay.

54:37.021 --> 54:39.322
Don't over exert yourself, Spencer.

54:39.324 --> 54:43.260
We need you, so don't go away now.

54:43.262 --> 54:47.197

54:51.369 --> 54:54.771

54:54.773 --> 54:56.373
We didn't.

54:56.375 --> 54:58.608
You just don't dwell on it, okay?

54:58.610 --> 55:00.376
Our job right now is to be here.

55:00.378 --> 55:01.945
- That's all we can do.
- No.

55:01.947 --> 55:03.613
Hey, how is he?

55:03.615 --> 55:07.249
He's, he's alive, you
know. I mean that's good.

55:07.251 --> 55:08.918

55:08.920 --> 55:10.387
Well, they're still passed out.

55:10.389 --> 55:12.688

- Yeah. Just. Come on in.

55:40.152 --> 55:42.721
We'll wait outside.

55:48.360 --> 55:51.597
They said that your
lungs were full of water.

55:55.333 --> 55:57.836
I was so scared.

56:00.873 --> 56:03.242
Are you okay?

56:04.943 --> 56:07.244
What were you thinking?

56:07.246 --> 56:10.414
How do I know that you
didn't do this on purpose?

56:10.416 --> 56:12.416
Good question.

56:12.418 --> 56:14.320
What?

56:57.329 --> 56:59.295

56:59.297 --> 57:00.496

57:00.498 --> 57:02.365
Spencer, stop!

57:02.367 --> 57:04.870
- <i>Stop!</i>
- Let me go.

57:36.268 --> 57:37.869
Fuck!

57:39.471 --> 57:43.940
Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

57:43.942 --> 57:45.809
Fuck.

58:03.829 --> 58:05.364
Hi.

59:06.458 --> 59:08.358
Ah!

59:08.360 --> 59:09.992
- You're it.
- Ah!

59:09.994 --> 59:13.095
No, stop, that is not, that is not fair.

59:13.097 --> 59:15.298
Two-person tag that
doesn't even make sense.

59:15.300 --> 59:16.566
It was your idea.

59:16.568 --> 59:19.302
Well, you should stop listening to me.

59:19.304 --> 59:21.237
I'm pretty sure you're the
first woman in the history

59:21.239 --> 59:24.608
of the world to ever say that.

59:24.610 --> 59:27.309
Just kiss me.

59:27.311 --> 59:29.947
Okay, if I have to.

59:36.054 --> 59:37.653
Can we live here?

59:37.655 --> 59:40.590
Don't you maybe, uh, want somewhere

59:40.592 --> 59:44.226
that has, I don't know, a ceiling?

59:44.228 --> 59:47.031
- Some walls?
- No, what for?

59:48.065 --> 59:52.235
We need our own dog.
That's the first thing.

59:52.237 --> 59:53.269
One, two, three, golden retriever.

59:53.271 --> 59:54.972
Golden retriever.

01:00:07.251 --> 01:00:08.284
Spencer.

01:00:09.320 --> 01:00:12.121
Spencer, look at me.

01:00:12.123 --> 01:00:14.359
Hey, hey.

01:00:16.561 --> 01:00:19.028
Sir, you can't leave against
medical adviser not signing...

01:00:19.030 --> 01:00:21.331
- Where you going?
- Excuse me.

01:00:21.333 --> 01:00:23.365
I can't be here anymore,
I have things to do.

01:00:23.367 --> 01:00:25.101
What things?
Wait-wait-wait, take it easy.

01:00:25.103 --> 01:00:26.503
Calm down. You wanna get outta here?

01:00:26.505 --> 01:00:29.007
Let's go, I'll go with you.

01:00:42.487 --> 01:00:45.155
Hey, Spencer?

01:00:45.157 --> 01:00:47.691
Spencer. Spencer.

01:00:47.693 --> 01:00:49.959
What the fuck happened last night?

01:00:49.961 --> 01:00:53.664
I killed that girl, man. She was with me.

01:00:56.001 --> 01:00:57.434
No one knows she was there, do they?

01:00:57.436 --> 01:00:59.436
No man, you zipped off alone last night.

01:00:59.438 --> 01:01:01.940
I think you might be a
little loopy right now.

01:01:07.278 --> 01:01:08.545
This is exactly what I need.

01:01:10.148 --> 01:01:11.380
She wasn't with you, man

01:01:11.382 --> 01:01:13.749
so don't beat yourself up about it... okay?

01:01:13.751 --> 01:01:17.019
You were a little tipsy, you
were high on fuckin' adrenaline.

01:01:17.021 --> 01:01:18.588
The crash messed with your
memory stick, that's all.

01:01:18.590 --> 01:01:22.291
- Do you have her number?
- There are no coincidences.

01:01:22.293 --> 01:01:24.293
That's what I've learned.

01:01:24.295 --> 01:01:27.229
She found this book at the party.

01:01:27.231 --> 01:01:29.199
It was in the library and she recited

01:01:29.201 --> 01:01:32.302
every fucking word of it from memory.

01:01:32.304 --> 01:01:34.269
Holy Grail.

01:01:34.271 --> 01:01:36.842
Destiny kinda shit.

01:01:39.077 --> 01:01:42.045
I don't know what you're
talkin' about, man.

01:01:42.047 --> 01:01:43.612
Look, I'll-I'll go check at the lake.

01:01:43.614 --> 01:01:45.682
I need you to help me maximize
my extended breath-hold.

01:01:45.684 --> 01:01:46.715
I'm out of practice.

01:01:46.717 --> 01:01:48.517
Hold this.

01:01:48.519 --> 01:01:51.420
Spencer, what is going on with you, man?

01:01:51.422 --> 01:01:53.722
Press start when I go under.

01:01:53.724 --> 01:01:55.827
Spencer!

01:01:57.094 --> 01:02:00.531
Spencer! Spencer!

01:02:04.302 --> 01:02:06.702
Okay.

01:02:06.704 --> 01:02:11.407
Peanut butter... or...

01:02:11.409 --> 01:02:13.776
...peanut butter and jelly?

01:02:13.778 --> 01:02:16.079
How do you eat a peanut butter sandwich?

01:02:16.081 --> 01:02:18.380
Doesn't it stick to your mouth?

01:02:18.382 --> 01:02:20.383
I like it.

01:02:20.385 --> 01:02:23.186
This jelly is so slimy.

01:02:23.188 --> 01:02:25.220
- You're slimy.
- You're slimy.

01:02:25.222 --> 01:02:27.423
No, you literally kinda slimy.

01:02:27.425 --> 01:02:30.561
No. No!

01:02:33.197 --> 01:02:37.499
- We should make a toast.
- What to?

01:02:39.237 --> 01:02:42.206
I don't know. You do it.

01:02:43.307 --> 01:02:46.108
To long life.

01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:48.778
Is that supposed to be ironic?

01:02:50.614 --> 01:02:53.215
Okay. Uh, to peace on Earth.

01:02:53.217 --> 01:02:54.784
You're boring.

01:02:54.786 --> 01:02:57.519
Fine, I don't know.

01:02:57.521 --> 01:03:00.123
- To boobs.
- Boobs?

01:03:00.125 --> 01:03:03.358
Well, I guess that's something.

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:05.063
Clink.

01:03:14.539 --> 01:03:17.307
Hey, hey.

01:03:17.309 --> 01:03:18.340
Breathe.

01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:26.416
- What was my time?
- Fuck you, man. Fuck.

01:03:26.418 --> 01:03:29.719
You have to stop it when
I come out of the water!

01:03:29.721 --> 01:03:31.255
Goddammit!

01:03:34.326 --> 01:03:36.827
What the fuck?

01:03:42.701 --> 01:03:45.168
What the fuckin' hell, stuntman.

01:03:45.170 --> 01:03:46.769
Yeah, think of all the
times we could have like...

01:03:46.771 --> 01:03:49.271
Halloween?

01:03:49.273 --> 01:03:51.307
I really don't recall that night.

01:03:51.309 --> 01:03:52.909
Well, dude, you were driving.

01:03:52.911 --> 01:03:54.309
Well, if you remember it so well

01:03:54.311 --> 01:03:55.677
why weren't you drivin'?

01:03:55.679 --> 01:03:57.213
I'll punch you in the liver.

01:03:59.684 --> 01:04:01.751
Are his parents home? Like,
maybe we should go in to garage.

01:04:01.753 --> 01:04:03.786
The whole point was for
us to wait for him here.

01:04:03.788 --> 01:04:05.554
Yeah, but if we're smokin',
then maybe we shouldn't do

01:04:05.556 --> 01:04:07.590
that in a seedy alley, genius.

01:04:07.592 --> 01:04:09.425
Cops patrol back here.

01:04:09.427 --> 01:04:11.760
Would you at least grow a right nut, Paul?

01:04:11.762 --> 01:04:13.463
Don't have to go for
both, I know that's a lot

01:04:13.465 --> 01:04:16.633
to ask from you, but just
invest in half the package...

01:04:17.802 --> 01:04:21.239
- Jesus Christ!
- Uh, come on.

01:04:22.407 --> 01:04:24.673
You're like the fuckin'
seed of Chucky, man.

01:04:24.675 --> 01:04:26.342
You know, Toad's been callin' me.

01:04:26.344 --> 01:04:27.577
What the fuck is going on?

01:04:27.579 --> 01:04:29.746
Uh, we saw it all. It's fine, okay?

01:04:29.748 --> 01:04:31.680
Look, they pulled the car
out, there was no one in there

01:04:31.682 --> 01:04:33.383
she couldn't have been with him.

01:04:33.385 --> 01:04:35.351
- Well, how can you be so sure?
- I swear on my life, man.

01:04:35.353 --> 01:04:36.753
We just came from there.

01:04:36.755 --> 01:04:38.521
Well... then where is she?

01:04:38.523 --> 01:04:40.690
Look, we saw him leave, we
didn't see her leave, okay?

01:04:40.692 --> 01:04:42.224
What do you think, they had like

01:04:42.226 --> 01:04:43.559
a secret rendezvous point or somethin'?

01:04:43.561 --> 01:04:45.762
Calm down. It's nothin' to worry about.

01:04:45.764 --> 01:04:47.429
Toad said that Spencer said...

01:04:47.431 --> 01:04:50.700
Consider tangible evidence
versus the fucked up

01:04:50.702 --> 01:04:52.635
post-accident mind of your hero, okay?

01:04:52.637 --> 01:04:54.836
He's not working on a practical level.

01:04:54.838 --> 01:04:56.405
Don't get on an edge about it.

01:04:56.407 --> 01:04:57.606
No, not an edge, I'm
tryin' to figure out...

01:04:57.608 --> 01:04:59.541
Chill out, bro, okay?

01:04:59.543 --> 01:05:01.878
I'm done with the conspiracy theories.

01:05:01.880 --> 01:05:03.479
Let's get some tunes goin'.

01:05:07.619 --> 01:05:09.351
Oh, you have to kill me.

01:05:09.353 --> 01:05:11.753
- What... cops?
- Uh, girlfriend.

01:05:11.755 --> 01:05:14.289
Oh! Crap, hide.

01:05:14.291 --> 01:05:15.758
- Let's hide.
- Where do you wanna hide?

01:05:15.760 --> 01:05:17.360
What, the glove compartment or somethin'?

01:05:17.362 --> 01:05:20.264
- Hey, you guys, come on.
- Alright.

01:05:22.467 --> 01:05:24.970
Oh. Hey.

01:05:26.938 --> 01:05:28.704
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

01:05:28.706 --> 01:05:30.673
Hey, Emily.

01:05:30.675 --> 01:05:33.342
We didn't even see you there.

01:05:33.344 --> 01:05:34.943
He's not with you?

01:05:34.945 --> 01:05:38.748
Uh, no, uh, we're waiting
for him, he's still with Toad.

01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:40.950
He told you to say that?

01:05:40.952 --> 01:05:43.552
- No.
- No, it's true.

01:05:43.554 --> 01:05:45.387
Why did you guys leave
him alone last night?

01:05:45.389 --> 01:05:46.688
We didn't.

01:05:46.690 --> 01:05:48.724
Ask Cooper, he'll tell you all about Alice.

01:05:48.726 --> 01:05:50.394
You, idiot.

01:05:51.663 --> 01:05:54.796
That's not a thing. I don't know
what I'm talking about. I'm...

01:05:54.798 --> 01:05:57.934
I'm kidding. Cooper's such a nut.

01:05:57.936 --> 01:05:59.635
Who's Alice?

01:05:59.637 --> 01:06:03.141
Look, Em, we don't wanna
get in the middle of this?

01:06:04.541 --> 01:06:07.045
Too late now, Cooper.

01:06:14.985 --> 01:06:17.753
- How you doin', Em?
- Who's Alice?

01:06:17.755 --> 01:06:20.757
I'm gonna take off with these guys.

01:06:20.759 --> 01:06:22.557
Hey, what's up? Everything alright?

01:06:22.559 --> 01:06:25.695
- No, not really.
- What happened at the lake?

01:06:25.697 --> 01:06:28.063
Yeah, we checked it out. Took
a look around. She's not there.

01:06:28.065 --> 01:06:31.168
That's not what Spencer was saying to me.

01:06:34.838 --> 01:06:36.373
Spencer.

01:06:39.643 --> 01:06:42.644
Okay, I just need to say this.

01:06:42.646 --> 01:06:45.782
I've been thinking, and I
can't pretend like I'm not angry

01:06:45.784 --> 01:06:50.320
and you need to understand that
I have every right to be angry.

01:06:50.322 --> 01:06:52.789
I wanna give you whatever
space it is that you're needing

01:06:52.791 --> 01:06:54.456
but I also wanna be there for you

01:06:54.458 --> 01:06:58.062
because you clearly cannot
be here for yourself.

01:07:00.565 --> 01:07:02.731
So let's just start with you doing

01:07:02.733 --> 01:07:06.536
a much better job of talking to me.

01:07:10.574 --> 01:07:13.575
What are you doing?

01:07:13.577 --> 01:07:15.845
I broke my record.

01:07:15.847 --> 01:07:18.780
Are you even listening to me?

01:07:18.782 --> 01:07:20.650
Most of the time.

01:07:20.652 --> 01:07:23.686
Spencer, I'm trying to tell
you that I think you need help.

01:07:23.688 --> 01:07:26.191
Yes, will you time me?

01:07:27.826 --> 01:07:30.528
Who's Alice?

01:07:34.099 --> 01:07:36.802
Where did you meet her?

01:07:39.471 --> 01:07:42.537
- At work.
- When?

01:07:42.539 --> 01:07:44.507
I don't know, what's the day.

01:07:44.509 --> 01:07:46.575
Did you know her before
you broke up with me?

01:07:46.577 --> 01:07:49.077
- I didn't break up with you.
- God, God, don't say that.

01:07:49.079 --> 01:07:52.648
It makes it worse.

01:07:52.650 --> 01:07:55.887
- Did you know her?
- Yes.

01:07:57.021 --> 01:07:58.653
- Did you sleep with her?
- Em...

01:07:58.655 --> 01:08:01.456
Don't act like it's not
an important question.

01:08:01.458 --> 01:08:02.592
I didn't say no. Can't you just...

01:08:02.594 --> 01:08:04.059
Can't you just what?

01:08:04.061 --> 01:08:06.561
Figure it out, stupid girlfriend
or sometimes-girlfriend

01:08:06.563 --> 01:08:08.798
or whatever it is that I am?

01:08:08.800 --> 01:08:11.032
My God, Spencer, you were so good

01:08:11.034 --> 01:08:13.702
and now lying and not
telling the truth all at once.

01:08:13.704 --> 01:08:15.438
It's just a thing that happened.

01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.906
So that's it?

01:08:16.908 --> 01:08:18.707
You come back and it's
like five years together

01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:20.675
that's just gone?

01:08:20.676 --> 01:08:22.544
You had your freedom, and now you come back

01:08:22.546 --> 01:08:24.813
and you're some kinda guy that
takes random girls to parties?

01:08:24.814 --> 01:08:27.517
You don't think that I
know that I fucked up.

01:08:27.519 --> 01:08:31.720
Whatever I'm feeling it's not about you.

01:08:31.721 --> 01:08:35.460
The whole thing has nothing to do with you.

01:08:48.604 --> 01:08:50.705
And you see this one. Did
he take out that tree too?

01:08:50.707 --> 01:08:53.975
That's what it did to the car.

01:08:53.978 --> 01:08:55.644
- Where were you?
- Spencer?

01:08:55.645 --> 01:08:59.482
- Sit down!
- Hello, Spencer, how are ya?

01:08:59.484 --> 01:09:00.982
I'll call Henry.

01:09:00.984 --> 01:09:04.019
I understand you had a bit
of an accident last night.

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:05.620
Yes, sir.

01:09:05.622 --> 01:09:07.990
The main thing is we
just wanna get you back

01:09:07.992 --> 01:09:09.759
where you need to be.

01:09:09.761 --> 01:09:10.792
What if you get called back?

01:09:10.795 --> 01:09:13.129
Your country and-and our family

01:09:13.131 --> 01:09:14.464
need you to be ready for that.

01:09:14.466 --> 01:09:15.932
Listen, now-now legally

01:09:15.934 --> 01:09:17.567
you're just lookin' at
damage to the guard rail

01:09:17.569 --> 01:09:19.801
a few private trees, things
like that, simple stuff.

01:09:19.804 --> 01:09:22.504
No real harm done there.

01:09:22.506 --> 01:09:24.906
But we know about the boy at the party.

01:09:24.908 --> 01:09:26.843
Cell phone videos, all that.

01:09:26.845 --> 01:09:30.045
Family lawyer has got in touch with us.

01:09:30.046 --> 01:09:32.482
Now, luckily there's no brain damage.

01:09:32.484 --> 01:09:34.149
Gonna be some reconstructive
surgery necessary.

01:09:34.152 --> 01:09:36.919
I think it's much better...

01:09:36.921 --> 01:09:38.854
...if we just sweep it
away, settle out of court.

01:09:38.856 --> 01:09:40.923
Your parents and I'll
pay off all the bills.

01:09:40.925 --> 01:09:42.258
And you are gonna work off

01:09:42.260 --> 01:09:44.626
every last cent, you understand me?

01:09:44.627 --> 01:09:46.696
Yes, you'll pay off the bills.

01:09:46.698 --> 01:09:48.163
We can deal with that later.

01:09:48.166 --> 01:09:50.265
I think what's much more important here

01:09:50.268 --> 01:09:52.535
is that everyone's concerned about you.

01:09:52.537 --> 01:09:55.871
The way I see it, Spencer,
the only way out is through.

01:09:55.873 --> 01:09:59.741
Your parents are here, your
friends, they can all help.

01:09:59.743 --> 01:10:01.110
But you're gonna have
to just look this thing

01:10:01.112 --> 01:10:04.246
right in the face and deal with it.

01:10:04.248 --> 01:10:08.084
Be a man. Say your I'm sorrys.

01:10:08.086 --> 01:10:10.686
And move on.

01:10:10.688 --> 01:10:12.220
This isn't a damn game.

01:10:12.222 --> 01:10:13.688
Didn't they teach you discipline?

01:10:13.690 --> 01:10:14.723
Josh, please.

01:10:14.725 --> 01:10:16.092
Spence, let's go.

01:10:16.094 --> 01:10:17.692
Guys, no, not now. Not now.

01:10:17.694 --> 01:10:18.861
You know, what, these
guys need to understand

01:10:18.863 --> 01:10:19.995
the gravity of the situation.

01:10:19.997 --> 01:10:21.830
They're half the problem.

01:10:21.832 --> 01:10:23.031
- Let's go, guys, come on.
- Hey!

01:10:23.033 --> 01:10:24.767
- Come on, this way.
- Come on.

01:10:24.769 --> 01:10:27.137
We're getting out of here.

01:11:08.246 --> 01:11:11.280
This is like the best day ever.

01:11:11.282 --> 01:11:14.317
What is this?

01:11:14.319 --> 01:11:17.055
I've got a surprise for you.

01:11:18.590 --> 01:11:20.291
Where?

01:11:55.225 --> 01:11:56.858
This is heaven?

01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:59.227
Or a dream?

01:11:59.229 --> 01:12:02.365
Is this the book?

01:12:02.367 --> 01:12:05.670
Alice, uh, are these people from the book?

01:12:08.905 --> 01:12:10.406
Come on, you know the answer.

01:12:13.110 --> 01:12:16.044
Just stop asking questions.

01:12:16.046 --> 01:12:18.981
It's just a place like any other.

01:12:18.983 --> 01:12:21.485
But can it last forever?

01:12:22.819 --> 01:12:25.286
Can anything?

01:12:25.288 --> 01:12:27.289
If you don't let it
end, it doesn't have to.

01:12:29.159 --> 01:12:30.259
It'll never have to.

01:12:30.261 --> 01:12:32.097
Right?

01:12:33.131 --> 01:12:35.130
Only question you should be asking...

01:12:37.301 --> 01:12:40.335
...is where should I be right now.

01:12:40.337 --> 01:12:42.271
I know the answer.

01:12:42.273 --> 01:12:44.373
Here.

01:12:44.375 --> 01:12:46.174
With you.

01:12:57.889 --> 01:12:59.421
I'm-I'm-I'm
starting to feel

01:12:59.423 --> 01:13:02.659
like that might not be a victory, Spencer.

01:13:04.929 --> 01:13:06.294
Why don't you wanna be back

01:13:06.296 --> 01:13:09.065
with all those people
who are waiting for you?

01:13:09.067 --> 01:13:11.200
- Oh, I can't.
- Why?

01:13:11.202 --> 01:13:14.003
Because...

01:13:14.005 --> 01:13:15.870
...I've...

01:13:15.872 --> 01:13:17.238
...I've done things.

01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:19.974
What-what-what
things?

01:13:19.976 --> 01:13:22.212
Terrible things.

01:13:23.381 --> 01:13:26.818
- Spencer...
- I can't breathe up there.

01:13:31.189 --> 01:13:34.089
They never found my body, did they?

01:13:34.091 --> 01:13:36.759
Spencer, oh my God.

01:13:36.761 --> 01:13:38.193
Breathe. Breathe!

01:13:38.195 --> 01:13:40.196
Wake up, breathe.

01:13:40.198 --> 01:13:41.296
Spencer.

01:13:41.298 --> 01:13:43.264
Mom?

01:13:43.266 --> 01:13:45.401
- Spencer, wake up.
- No, no, let be back.

01:13:45.403 --> 01:13:46.869
- No, Spencer. Spencer!
- Let be back.

01:13:46.871 --> 01:13:48.169
Spencer, if you father sees you

01:13:48.171 --> 01:13:50.004
doing this, he'll go crazy.

01:13:50.006 --> 01:13:52.107
Look at me! Look at me.

01:13:52.109 --> 01:13:53.776
Oh, baby.

01:13:53.778 --> 01:13:56.778
You need, you need to stay here.

01:13:56.780 --> 01:13:58.414
- Here, Spencer.
- No, no.

01:13:58.416 --> 01:14:00.081
- I can't stay here.
- Stop!

01:14:00.083 --> 01:14:01.317
- Spencer, stop it!
- I can't stay here.

01:14:01.319 --> 01:14:03.451
Please let me help you.

01:14:05.323 --> 01:14:08.324
Spencer? Spencer?

01:14:08.326 --> 01:14:10.125
Let's go. Come on, man.

01:14:10.127 --> 01:14:12.961
Stop, stop.

01:14:12.963 --> 01:14:15.397
Just stop, stop. Let's slow down.

01:14:15.399 --> 01:14:17.133
- Just slow everything down.
- What for?

01:14:17.135 --> 01:14:18.933
What for? Come on, you're
so intense right now.

01:14:18.935 --> 01:14:21.003
Let's just... take a deep breath

01:14:21.005 --> 01:14:23.272
and talk about where we go from here.

01:14:23.274 --> 01:14:24.773
That's the theme of the day.

01:14:24.775 --> 01:14:26.776
Yeah, well, do you
realize what you just did?

01:14:26.778 --> 01:14:29.144
I broke five minutes, man.

01:14:29.146 --> 01:14:30.812
The Submarine Kid broke twenty.

01:14:30.814 --> 01:14:33.115
I think she can hold her breath forever.

01:14:33.117 --> 01:14:35.250
Spencer, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

01:14:35.252 --> 01:14:37.419
Just more practice then
I can stay with her!

01:14:37.421 --> 01:14:39.789
Stop thinking about this shit! Quit it!

01:14:39.791 --> 01:14:41.991
Let's just take your brother,
we can go to Nathan's.

01:14:41.993 --> 01:14:43.424
On the way at least we
can get a case of beer

01:14:43.426 --> 01:14:45.494
and a sack of weed and
fucking relax and talk about.

01:14:45.496 --> 01:14:47.263
No, man! Let me do this!

01:14:47.265 --> 01:14:49.098
Do what? Wait.

01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:50.566
What are you doing?

01:15:08.185 --> 01:15:10.554
Not good enough.

01:16:02.273 --> 01:16:05.174
<i>"Although her car was recovered</i>

01:16:05.176 --> 01:16:08.509
<i>"the body of the

01:16:49.654 --> 01:16:51.889
No, no, no, no.

01:16:53.256 --> 01:16:55.590
No, this can't be fucking happening.

01:16:55.592 --> 01:16:57.358
This can't be fucking happening.

01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.428
No, no, no.

01:16:59.430 --> 01:17:00.528
Fuck!

01:17:00.530 --> 01:17:03.365
Fuck! What the fuck!

01:17:03.367 --> 01:17:05.601
What the fuck!

01:17:11.074 --> 01:17:12.473
Goddammit!

01:17:12.475 --> 01:17:15.443
Goddammit! Let me back!

01:18:03.194 --> 01:18:04.759
Fuck, Spencer!

01:18:04.761 --> 01:18:07.998
I didn't know you were here.

01:18:23.447 --> 01:18:25.147
I'm sorry, Marc.

01:18:25.149 --> 01:18:27.782
I'm so fucking sorry.

01:18:27.784 --> 01:18:29.284
This isn't about you.

01:18:29.286 --> 01:18:30.285
I shouldn't have brought this here.

01:18:30.287 --> 01:18:33.054
Don't apologize for this.

01:18:33.056 --> 01:18:35.790
Can you talk to me?

01:18:35.792 --> 01:18:37.459
What do you want me to say?

01:18:37.461 --> 01:18:40.262
Just tell me the truth.

01:18:40.264 --> 01:18:41.763
The only easy day was yesterday.

01:18:41.765 --> 01:18:43.699
No, man, no bullshit.

01:18:43.701 --> 01:18:46.069
I want the truth.

01:19:10.060 --> 01:19:12.095
What is this?

01:19:20.604 --> 01:19:23.106
It's a book about me.

01:19:25.775 --> 01:19:27.644
Spencer...

01:19:29.145 --> 01:19:31.345
...I know you won't believe
me, but whatever this is

01:19:31.347 --> 01:19:33.885
it's not your story.

01:19:35.185 --> 01:19:37.119
You think you're escaping
the bullshit with this

01:19:37.121 --> 01:19:39.754
but you're just going farther into it.

01:19:39.756 --> 01:19:41.456
You're lost.

01:19:41.458 --> 01:19:45.126
I was just like you. I
came back, I was a shell.

01:19:45.128 --> 01:19:48.129
I had to retrace the steps.

01:19:48.131 --> 01:19:50.665
It's hard work.

01:19:50.667 --> 01:19:54.369
I know how tempting it looks...

01:19:54.371 --> 01:19:58.639
...but just getting
out is not real freedom.

01:19:58.641 --> 01:20:01.143
Obsessing over this kind of shit

01:20:01.145 --> 01:20:03.648
is just an escape.

01:20:05.381 --> 01:20:06.615
Deal...

01:20:06.617 --> 01:20:09.119
...with what's real.

01:20:13.423 --> 01:20:16.027
Tell me what's going on.

01:20:22.332 --> 01:20:24.500
Spencer?

01:20:58.569 --> 01:21:01.072
Shut the door.

01:21:03.673 --> 01:21:06.508
- Did they hear me?
- No.

01:21:06.510 --> 01:21:09.544
This came for you.

01:21:09.546 --> 01:21:12.414
It's from the marines.

01:21:12.416 --> 01:21:14.918
You can open it.

01:21:19.289 --> 01:21:21.790
Don't look up to me.

01:21:28.298 --> 01:21:30.667
Are you okay?

01:21:33.970 --> 01:21:36.504
Toad's coming to get us.

01:21:36.506 --> 01:21:38.206
Get ready.

01:21:38.208 --> 01:21:39.575
Where are we going?

01:22:18.282 --> 01:22:20.818
This is my favorite place in the world.

01:22:23.753 --> 01:22:26.988
This is my favorite place in the world.

01:22:26.990 --> 01:22:29.790
Do you hear that?

01:22:29.792 --> 01:22:34.064
You're my favorite place
in the whole fucking world!

01:22:35.365 --> 01:22:39.737
You're almost perfect, you fucking lake!

01:22:46.310 --> 01:22:50.478
♪ Balls so hard
motherfuckers wanna find me ♪

01:22:50.480 --> 01:22:52.947
♪ But first they gotta find me ♪♪

01:22:52.949 --> 01:22:54.348
Look who worked off his hangover.

01:22:54.350 --> 01:22:56.418
Yeah, took all fucking day.

01:22:56.420 --> 01:22:58.786
Well, I'm here.

01:22:58.788 --> 01:23:01.458
- Take the beer.
- Give me the beer.

01:23:02.926 --> 01:23:05.326
Alright, guys, listen up.

01:23:05.328 --> 01:23:07.028
I don't wanna get all
cheesy fucking sentimental

01:23:07.030 --> 01:23:09.330
with you guys, but you are my brothers.

01:23:09.332 --> 01:23:12.467
And I've been thinking ever
since this sister got back.

01:23:12.469 --> 01:23:14.535
And no matter what the fuck happens...

01:23:14.537 --> 01:23:16.470
...you know, no matter
how crazy this world gets

01:23:16.472 --> 01:23:18.040
you guys are the one thing that I've got

01:23:18.042 --> 01:23:20.075
that's never going away.

01:23:20.077 --> 01:23:22.576
And God help me for the grief
I'm gonna suffer for this

01:23:22.578 --> 01:23:24.745
but I fuckin' love each and
every one of you, alright?

01:23:24.747 --> 01:23:27.817
Yes. Clink, bitches.

01:23:46.537 --> 01:23:47.968
Hey, come on.

01:23:47.970 --> 01:23:49.804
- Good girl.
- Hey.

01:23:49.806 --> 01:23:51.973
Hey, let's build a house.

01:23:51.975 --> 01:23:53.075
I know how to do it.

01:23:53.077 --> 01:23:54.976
We can't stay here.

01:23:54.978 --> 01:23:57.012
I know everything.

01:23:57.014 --> 01:23:59.348
I saw what happened to you.

01:23:59.350 --> 01:24:01.650
I don't care.

01:24:01.652 --> 01:24:03.951
You want me to be like him?

01:24:03.953 --> 01:24:06.053
I am.

01:24:06.055 --> 01:24:08.055
I can show you.

01:24:08.057 --> 01:24:10.558
We can stay here.

01:24:10.560 --> 01:24:13.829
Spencer, there's roads
waiting for both of us.

01:24:13.831 --> 01:24:16.531
It won't be like this forever.

01:24:16.533 --> 01:24:18.567
I love you.

01:24:18.569 --> 01:24:19.901
The worst is almost over

01:24:19.903 --> 01:24:22.504
and then we'll have perfection.

01:24:22.506 --> 01:24:24.208
Look around.

01:24:25.442 --> 01:24:27.411
Perfection.

01:24:28.612 --> 01:24:30.280
Right?

01:24:31.748 --> 01:24:34.150
There's no such thing...

01:24:47.463 --> 01:24:50.501
You can't hide from her with me.

01:24:52.869 --> 01:24:54.568
Wait.

01:24:54.570 --> 01:24:55.669
Wait.

01:24:58.509 --> 01:25:01.041
Hey, ten minutes and
fourteen seconds, dude.

01:25:02.512 --> 01:25:03.778
Are you fucking kidding me?

01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:05.513
He almost drowned in the sink right there.

01:25:05.515 --> 01:25:07.715
- This is not fucking okay.
- Chill out, he's fine.

01:25:07.717 --> 01:25:08.916
We were with him the whole time.

01:25:08.918 --> 01:25:10.117
He's not fucking fine, Nick.

01:25:10.119 --> 01:25:11.753
Does he look fucking fine to you?

01:25:11.755 --> 01:25:13.421
He's coughing water all
over the fucking floor.

01:25:13.423 --> 01:25:14.790
Stop, come on, come
on, come on, stop, stop.

01:25:14.792 --> 01:25:16.424
I'm fine.

01:25:16.426 --> 01:25:17.925
- Did you say ten minutes?
- Hell, yeah, bro.

01:25:17.927 --> 01:25:20.161
But I'm not sure it should
count since your ass passed out.

01:25:20.163 --> 01:25:23.099
Fucking idiots. Come on, get up.

01:25:25.702 --> 01:25:27.602
Well, what do you guys say?

01:25:27.604 --> 01:25:29.571
Huh? Huh? Am I in line?

01:25:29.573 --> 01:25:31.039
Let's check with the Russian judge.

01:25:31.041 --> 01:25:33.074
Fuck off, Howie!

01:25:33.076 --> 01:25:35.311
It's not funny!

01:25:37.948 --> 01:25:40.581
Wow, he was actually mad.

01:25:40.583 --> 01:25:42.884
I knew comin' up here was a bad idea.

01:25:42.886 --> 01:25:44.186
Yo, what, hey.

01:25:44.188 --> 01:25:47.688
What if he really just died right now?

01:25:47.690 --> 01:25:51.625
- I'd feel bad about that?
- You-you'd feel bad about that?

01:25:51.627 --> 01:25:54.562
You're the master of the
understatement, Howie.

01:25:54.564 --> 01:25:56.232
Fuck!

01:25:59.869 --> 01:26:01.102
Hey, man, you really think

01:26:01.104 --> 01:26:03.007
he was trying to drown himself?

01:26:14.885 --> 01:26:17.686
What the hell is matter with you?

01:26:17.688 --> 01:26:18.887
I'm in love.

01:26:18.889 --> 01:26:20.655
With something that's fake.

01:26:20.657 --> 01:26:22.257
It's fake, it's a figment
of your imagination.

01:26:22.259 --> 01:26:23.825
Can't you just...

01:26:23.827 --> 01:26:25.593
...see her in your dreams or somethin'?

01:26:27.096 --> 01:26:28.830
That's stupid.

01:26:28.832 --> 01:26:30.831
No, what's fuckin' stupid
is you dunkin' your head

01:26:30.833 --> 01:26:32.601
in sinks and having people time you.

01:26:32.603 --> 01:26:33.802
That's fucking stupid.

01:26:33.804 --> 01:26:36.306
It's a matter of opinion, man.

01:26:39.176 --> 01:26:40.808
Spencer...

01:26:40.810 --> 01:26:44.044
...you're scaring me.

01:26:44.046 --> 01:26:46.680
You are playing some kind of game with God.

01:26:46.682 --> 01:26:49.084
And if you keep going on like this...

01:26:49.086 --> 01:26:51.620
...you're never gonna come up.

01:26:51.622 --> 01:26:53.254
Fuck, man, draw a picture of her.

01:26:53.256 --> 01:26:55.857
Or write a story, so
that maybe I can meet her

01:26:55.859 --> 01:26:58.125
but just-just fucking stop this.

01:26:58.127 --> 01:27:00.096
Stop it.

01:27:06.103 --> 01:27:07.971
What is that?

01:27:10.541 --> 01:27:13.842
Spencer, you realize there's
people that actually need you...

01:27:13.844 --> 01:27:15.479
...right?

01:27:25.655 --> 01:27:28.656
What do you want?

01:27:28.658 --> 01:27:30.625
I mean you wanna go away?

01:27:30.627 --> 01:27:32.626
You wanna leave this place then do it, go.

01:27:32.628 --> 01:27:34.995
But don't leave your life, I mean...

01:27:34.997 --> 01:27:38.165
...do you hear the way
that kid talks to you?

01:27:38.167 --> 01:27:40.134
Yeah.

01:27:40.136 --> 01:27:42.937
Good. Hear it.

01:27:42.939 --> 01:27:44.104
Because we all feel that way.

01:27:44.106 --> 01:27:46.609
We all love you, Spencer.

01:27:48.311 --> 01:27:49.910
Now, look me in the eye

01:27:49.912 --> 01:27:52.415
and tell me that you're
not gonna disappear.

01:27:54.618 --> 01:27:57.121
I'm not gonna disappear.

01:27:58.220 --> 01:28:01.125
Don't fuck with me, man, I trust you.

01:28:03.594 --> 01:28:05.628
Clink, bitch.

01:28:15.338 --> 01:28:17.573
Hmm. Alright.

01:28:34.925 --> 01:28:38.293
You can say that, but what
is his team going to do?

01:28:38.295 --> 01:28:41.629
They have no identity. They
have no identity at all.

01:28:41.631 --> 01:28:43.697
What I'm concerned about is
really the outfield player.

01:28:43.699 --> 01:28:47.268
I mean, if-if he, if he can't get guys...

01:28:54.711 --> 01:28:56.945
It doesn't make any sense, Jim.

01:28:56.947 --> 01:28:59.046
It doesn't, it doesn't make any sense.

01:28:59.048 --> 01:29:00.848
I completely agree with you.

01:29:00.850 --> 01:29:04.419
Okay, they-they've got...

01:29:04.421 --> 01:29:07.423
Well, that's my point
exactly, Tim, I mean...

01:29:46.363 --> 01:29:48.696
Talon-11 Actual,
Eagle-11 Actual

01:29:48.698 --> 01:29:50.932
No joy under HVT, he's gone to ground.

01:29:50.934 --> 01:29:54.001
Uh, move out the extract
towards Oscar Mike over.

01:29:54.003 --> 01:29:56.103
Roger that.

01:29:56.105 --> 01:29:58.205
Talon Actual out.

01:29:58.207 --> 01:30:00.208
Fuck this day.

01:30:00.210 --> 01:30:03.311
So when we get back to base,
the next round's on you.

01:30:03.313 --> 01:30:05.312
Round's on your mom.

01:30:05.314 --> 01:30:07.248
My mom will kick your ass, bro.

01:30:07.250 --> 01:30:09.752
Your mom could kiss my ass.

01:30:19.328 --> 01:30:22.129
Shit!

01:30:22.131 --> 01:30:24.965
Eagle-11, Talon Actual, we have
eyes on targets of opportunity.

01:30:24.967 --> 01:30:28.236
...we are weapons-free, over

01:30:28.238 --> 01:30:31.039
Talon-11, take the shot.

01:30:31.041 --> 01:30:32.440
Take the shot.

01:30:32.442 --> 01:30:33.808
- Fucking...
- What's the plan, boss?

01:30:33.810 --> 01:30:35.777
Eagle-11, let's take it, let's take it.

01:30:38.981 --> 01:30:41.482
- Roger that, weapons free.
- 'Weapons free.'

01:30:41.484 --> 01:30:44.218
Do not take the shot.

01:30:44.220 --> 01:30:46.321
I say again, do not take the shot.

01:31:24.327 --> 01:31:26.494
Come on, let's go!

01:31:26.496 --> 01:31:28.832
Let's go now!

01:31:51.822 --> 01:31:54.388
Talon One is compromised.

01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:56.156
Redirect for immediate medevac.

01:31:56.158 --> 01:32:00.463
Position... one click south of original.

01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:09.236
Let's get him out of here. Let's go.

01:32:09.238 --> 01:32:11.507
Let's go. Move it, move it.

01:33:05.161 --> 01:33:06.829
Hey, Spencer?

01:33:32.622 --> 01:33:34.054
Oh, shit.

01:33:34.056 --> 01:33:35.188
Toad, Toad, Toad.

01:33:35.190 --> 01:33:36.290
Toad, Toad, wake up.

01:33:36.292 --> 01:33:37.357
Yo, read this, dude.

01:33:37.359 --> 01:33:39.427
Wake up, man, he's out.

01:33:39.429 --> 01:33:41.995
He's out, man. It's over, he's discharged.

01:33:41.997 --> 01:33:43.298
- Spencer?
- Where are you?

01:33:43.300 --> 01:33:46.636
Boy! Spencer!

01:34:10.560 --> 01:34:14.528
Yo, where are you? It's time to celebrate.

01:34:14.530 --> 01:34:16.630
Yo, where are you, man?

01:34:16.632 --> 01:34:18.333
Spence?

01:34:18.335 --> 01:34:19.869
Spence?

01:34:22.271 --> 01:34:23.571
- Oh, shit!
- Spencer!

01:34:23.573 --> 01:34:25.373
Man, have you seen Spencer?

01:34:25.375 --> 01:34:27.208
Check it out, man, he's done.

01:34:27.210 --> 01:34:28.675
He's in the fucking lake.

01:34:40.457 --> 01:34:42.159
Spencer!

01:34:47.130 --> 01:34:48.528
Spencer!

01:34:48.530 --> 01:34:52.165
No! Let me go! Spencer!

01:34:52.167 --> 01:34:54.670
- No, no, stay here.
- Spencer!

01:34:58.073 --> 01:35:00.040
Spencer!

01:35:38.747 --> 01:35:40.916
Spencer!

01:35:42.351 --> 01:35:44.352
Spencer!

01:35:44.354 --> 01:35:45.889
Fuck!

01:35:47.390 --> 01:35:48.822
Spencer!

01:35:48.824 --> 01:35:50.693
Fuck, man!

01:35:52.761 --> 01:35:54.528
- Spencer!
- Spencer!

01:35:54.530 --> 01:35:56.664
Oh, fuck! Fuck!

01:35:56.666 --> 01:35:58.766
Fuck!

01:35:58.768 --> 01:36:00.604
Spencer!

01:36:06.609 --> 01:36:09.112
I've been working on something for you.

01:36:10.345 --> 01:36:12.146
I've been training myself

01:36:12.148 --> 01:36:14.514
like the kid did.

01:36:14.516 --> 01:36:17.184
This way we could be together forever.

01:36:17.186 --> 01:36:20.821
We can't do this anymore.

01:36:20.823 --> 01:36:22.522
This has to be goodbye.

01:36:22.524 --> 01:36:23.590
What do you want me to do, pretend

01:36:23.592 --> 01:36:24.858
I'm in love with someone else?

01:36:24.860 --> 01:36:27.794
I want you to stop pretending.

01:36:27.796 --> 01:36:29.598
I stopped.

01:36:30.667 --> 01:36:33.668
I pretended you were him, but you're not.

01:36:33.670 --> 01:36:36.336
I'm becoming him.

01:36:36.338 --> 01:36:38.705
Isn't that what you want?

01:36:38.707 --> 01:36:41.741
It's not enough.

01:36:41.743 --> 01:36:43.744
You see, you see this dress

01:36:43.746 --> 01:36:46.848
this, this place...

01:36:46.850 --> 01:36:48.382
...none of this belongs to you.

01:36:48.384 --> 01:36:50.317
It...

01:36:50.319 --> 01:36:52.152
...belongs to him.

01:36:52.154 --> 01:36:53.620
I thought I could stop waiting

01:36:53.622 --> 01:36:56.656
and find someone else

01:36:56.658 --> 01:36:59.126
but it doesn't work that way, Spencer.

01:36:59.128 --> 01:37:01.862
But he didn't die.

01:37:01.864 --> 01:37:03.830
He went off to find something better.

01:37:03.832 --> 01:37:05.599
- Just like me.
- No!

01:37:05.601 --> 01:37:07.335
I waited.

01:37:07.337 --> 01:37:11.371
I waited and I never got an answer.

01:37:11.373 --> 01:37:15.543
I tried to make you into what I needed.

01:37:15.545 --> 01:37:16.677
But it's not real.

01:37:16.679 --> 01:37:18.178
But I can prove it to you.

01:37:18.180 --> 01:37:20.248
I tried to be something else for you.

01:37:20.250 --> 01:37:23.518
Just like you're trying to be for me.

01:37:23.520 --> 01:37:25.322
But it's a mistake.

01:37:26.655 --> 01:37:31.491
I'm not the thing you
needed so badly to want.

01:37:31.493 --> 01:37:33.862
Give me my peace, Spencer.

01:37:35.364 --> 01:37:38.167
It's the only thing, that'll save us both.

01:37:43.439 --> 01:37:44.772
Just...

01:37:44.774 --> 01:37:47.909
It's a fresh start when I go under.

01:37:47.911 --> 01:37:51.213
You'll see so clearly this is all real.

01:37:52.448 --> 01:37:55.085
It's everything we both wanted.

01:38:21.610 --> 01:38:23.246
Go!

01:38:43.932 --> 01:38:45.766
Spencer!

01:38:45.768 --> 01:38:47.634
Somebody call fucking help!

01:38:47.636 --> 01:38:49.970
How the hell did this happen?
How did you let this happen?

01:38:49.972 --> 01:38:51.839
What are we supposed to do, Emily?

01:38:51.841 --> 01:38:53.808
Huh? What was I supposed to do?

01:38:53.810 --> 01:38:55.977
We need to get back out
there, we need to find him.

01:38:55.979 --> 01:38:58.512
Ah! He promised me that
he wasn't gonna disappear.

01:38:58.514 --> 01:38:59.746
Don't be stupid.

01:38:59.748 --> 01:39:01.249
You are such idiots, you let him

01:39:01.251 --> 01:39:02.817
jump in the fucking lake!

01:39:02.819 --> 01:39:06.387
I hate this stupid, fucking lake!

01:39:06.389 --> 01:39:08.455
Emily.

01:39:08.457 --> 01:39:10.159
Come on, come on.

01:40:00.842 --> 01:40:04.880
Ah! Alice, stop the watch.

01:40:05.948 --> 01:40:07.815
I know that was my best time yet.

01:40:10.019 --> 01:40:12.288
I counted to at least...

01:40:15.725 --> 01:40:16.891
What?

01:42:03.765 --> 01:42:06.101
<i>Once upon a time...</i>

01:42:17.180 --> 01:42:20.416
