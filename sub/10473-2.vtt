00:34.720 --> 00:39.510
'Our work was birth -
the primal act of a woman's life,

00:39.560 --> 00:42.670
'a time fuelled by instinct
and by fear.

00:42.720 --> 00:45.990
'Trusting our instinct
can be what we fear most.

00:46.040 --> 00:51.550
'Our actions are ours alone, and
we must suffer their consequences.'

00:51.600 --> 00:52.990
Morning, Cyril.

00:53.040 --> 00:54.760
Doris must be due any day now.

00:55.760 --> 00:57.990
Ready for those sleepless
nights again?

00:58.040 --> 01:00.110
Bet you thought you were
done with them!

01:00.160 --> 01:01.200
What can I say?

01:04.760 --> 01:07.190
Well, come on then, lads!
Put your backs into it!

01:07.240 --> 01:09.040
Got another load coming in at nine.

01:13.120 --> 01:16.070
We've either done something terribly
wrong or terribly right.

01:16.120 --> 01:19.710
Your new hairdo's probably drawn
complaints. Far too racy!

01:19.760 --> 01:22.230
It's modelled on Jean Seberg in
The Mouse That Roared.

01:22.280 --> 01:24.030
Or we've had the record
player up too loud

01:24.080 --> 01:25.950
and Sister Evangelina's not happy.

01:26.000 --> 01:26.990
Not enough jazz!

01:31.000 --> 01:32.040
Come in!

01:34.400 --> 01:36.950
We've had an awful
lot of change lately -

01:37.000 --> 01:40.630
the move, our new antenatal clinic.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.870
Our royal visit announced us
with some fanfare

01:42.920 --> 01:44.360
and we're far busier now.

01:45.640 --> 01:50.070
We need a figurehead, just to
steady the ship on clinic days.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.400
And it feels right
it should be one of you.

01:53.640 --> 01:57.110
All of you brim with
invaluable qualities.

01:57.160 --> 02:01.230
Nurse Franklin,
as our most senior midwife...

02:01.280 --> 02:02.750
I'd be absolutely thrilled....

02:02.800 --> 02:06.390
You bring a reassuring
presence to the wider community

02:06.440 --> 02:08.520
and I want you to continue
with that.

02:09.600 --> 02:14.030
Nurse Miller, keep forging ahead
with our Mothercraft programme,

02:14.080 --> 02:15.750
for which you show such aptitude.

02:15.800 --> 02:17.750
Of course, Sister Julienne.

02:17.800 --> 02:21.790
Nurse Lee, you showed gumption,
initiative

02:21.840 --> 02:23.910
and organisation during our move.

02:23.960 --> 02:27.750
I'd like you to
be our Acting Sister on clinic days.

02:27.800 --> 02:29.270
Don't quite know what to say.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.000
That you can start
with clinic this afternoon?

02:48.040 --> 02:51.870
Would have been nice to have been
considered, that's all I'm saying.

02:51.920 --> 02:54.360
"Reassuring presence
in the wider community"!

02:55.760 --> 02:58.550
Makes me sound like a drinking
fountain!

02:58.600 --> 03:00.480
Or a lamp post. Perfectly vital.

03:02.400 --> 03:05.080
Oh, look at, you, Sister Lee!

03:06.440 --> 03:08.230
Isn't it Acting Sister?

03:08.280 --> 03:10.230
Sister will do perfectly well.

03:10.280 --> 03:12.320
Are we going to be busy?
Full steam ahead.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.070
Good afternoon, ladies. Do come in.

03:28.120 --> 03:29.280
Oh, nice hat, Nurse!

03:32.800 --> 03:34.040
Hello.

03:38.200 --> 03:41.110
Mrs Aston?
Dr Turner's ready for you.

03:41.160 --> 03:42.320
The cubicle at this end.

03:49.480 --> 03:50.520
Watch it!

03:52.120 --> 03:54.790
We're low on iodine.
Would you mind restocking?

03:54.840 --> 03:57.550
Oh, and an inventory
of the cupboard would be useful.

03:57.600 --> 04:00.390
We should know exactly what
we have at all times.

04:00.440 --> 04:02.360
It's going to be a tight ship
from now on.

04:05.760 --> 04:07.560
(I rather preferred the loose one!)

04:09.040 --> 04:11.320
Mrs Short? Midwife will see you.

04:22.079 --> 04:23.320
How are you sleeping?

04:25.320 --> 04:27.030
Thomas says I turn like a mangle,

04:27.080 --> 04:31.720
but that's just cos there's still
so much to do, so much to be ready.

04:32.960 --> 04:35.110
It's round the corner
and we still ain't got a potty!

04:35.160 --> 04:37.870
Mrs Short, baby won't need
a potty for a while yet.

04:37.920 --> 04:40.760
I keep telling him,
"It's not going to happen by magic!"

04:42.120 --> 04:43.160
It's him and me.

04:44.880 --> 04:46.670
It's us.

04:46.720 --> 04:50.150
I keep telling him that, but
he just don't seem that bothered.

04:50.200 --> 04:53.080
Perhaps because he thinks you'll
make a very good mother.

04:54.360 --> 04:57.190
My mum always said I'd be a natural.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.760
But how can you be, though?

05:00.560 --> 05:02.390
Something as important as this,

05:02.440 --> 05:04.510
something you've never even
done before?

05:04.560 --> 05:08.200
Your mother knows you better than
anyone. Trust her, Mrs Short.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.160
Look up. Look up.

05:15.320 --> 05:19.120
They say that if you look up,
it stops you from crying.

05:22.160 --> 05:25.240
I lost Mum. Five months now.

05:26.520 --> 05:27.960
Only feels like yesterday.

05:30.200 --> 05:36.240
She said she was going to be there
with me and help me.

05:39.680 --> 05:40.720
But she's not...

05:42.560 --> 05:45.270
..and I'm all at sea, Nurse.

05:45.320 --> 05:48.520
You're with us now.
We will look after you.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.630
We need to be careful of anaemia,
Mrs Aston.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.750
And you need to slow down.

05:59.800 --> 06:01.430
There's not long to go now.

06:01.480 --> 06:03.080
Cutting hair keeps me sane.

06:05.000 --> 06:06.710
I can't lose my regulars.

06:06.760 --> 06:09.390
Took years to build up customers.

06:09.440 --> 06:11.790
Men wouldn't go near a woman cutter.

06:11.840 --> 06:14.990
Just like women wouldn't trust a man
with their hair till Vidal Sassoon.

06:15.040 --> 06:17.110
You'll be feeding for several
months, Mrs Aston.

06:17.160 --> 06:18.910
It won't be possible to
return to work.

06:18.960 --> 06:20.640
Well, as soon as it is, then.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.870
She doesn't seem to realise
she's about to have a baby.

06:27.920 --> 06:32.270
A little complacency is natural.
This is her fourth child.

06:32.320 --> 06:34.750
But we need to make sure she's
properly prepared at home.

06:34.800 --> 06:35.920
Of course, Doctor.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.510
I have numerous cupboards at home
in want of not just a stock-take

06:45.560 --> 06:46.950
but a good old sort.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.790
Volunteers will be fed and watered.

06:48.840 --> 06:50.590
Tell me
your cupboards are on the Riviera

06:50.640 --> 06:51.880
and I'll be there in a trice.

06:55.960 --> 06:57.870
It's peculiar, isn't it?

06:57.920 --> 07:01.760
We can be so very organised in our
work, yet so chaotic in our lives.

07:04.000 --> 07:07.870
I found a pair of Freddie's
booties in the larder this morning.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.470
It's only a matter of time before
I start using Peter's police helmet

07:10.520 --> 07:12.910
as a coal scuttle.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.790
If you need help, please ask.

07:15.840 --> 07:18.760
We seem to have a surfeit
of olive oil, at least. Chummy!

07:20.320 --> 07:22.590
One feels one should be
able to manage.

07:22.640 --> 07:24.310
You do!

07:24.360 --> 07:28.030
Besides, you promised all volunteers
would be fed and watered.

07:28.080 --> 07:29.800
I'm in it purely for the cakes.

07:39.480 --> 07:41.310
You checking up on me or something?

07:41.360 --> 07:42.990
I only saw you this morning.

07:43.040 --> 07:46.230
Sorry, Mrs Aston. I should have
given you our delivery pack.

07:46.280 --> 07:49.790
It's important it's kept clean,
dry and close at hand.

07:49.840 --> 07:51.830
Shall I take it
through to the bedroom?

07:53.400 --> 07:54.910
Never let up, do they?

07:54.960 --> 07:56.200
It's quite all right.

07:59.840 --> 08:01.760
Boys, leave the nurse's bike alone!

08:08.800 --> 08:12.430
We have a collection of items
at Nonnatus to help with

08:12.480 --> 08:15.830
the baby, should you need anything -

08:15.880 --> 08:17.910
a pram, perhaps, or a cot?

08:17.960 --> 08:19.710
I'm all right, ta.

08:19.760 --> 08:23.310
You're very close now, Mrs Aston.
You need to be ready for baby.

08:23.360 --> 08:25.510
I said I'm all right, Nurse!
If there's anything...

08:25.560 --> 08:27.710
I'd see Miss Franklin, wouldn't I?

08:27.760 --> 08:28.920
We get on, her and me.

08:30.080 --> 08:32.710
I hope you feel you
could see any of us.

08:32.760 --> 08:34.600
We all want what's
best for our patients.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.350
I dyed her hair the first time.

08:38.400 --> 08:40.510
Miss Franklin, I mean.

08:40.559 --> 08:42.789
Walked in as a mouse,
left as Jean Harlow!

08:42.840 --> 08:45.710
And she swears she's a natural
blonde! That's how good I am, Nurse.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.390
Yes, and I love her new hairdo.

08:47.440 --> 08:50.310
Don't be worrying about me.
I've had three already.

08:50.360 --> 08:51.880
I don't need no looking after.

09:10.560 --> 09:12.710
Very glamorous for a lecture.

09:12.760 --> 09:14.350
You never know who you'll meet.

09:14.400 --> 09:16.750
Dusty old academics
and midwives like us.

09:16.800 --> 09:18.990
It's a talk about childbirth!

09:19.040 --> 09:21.150
Oh, we'd nearly given up on you.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.510
If we hurry, we should still make it.

09:23.560 --> 09:27.390
The transformative powers of silk.
Day to night in an instant.

09:27.440 --> 09:30.070
You can thank me later with a
Babycham. Come on, Sister Lee.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.550
Time to take your work hat off.

09:31.600 --> 09:33.000
And put your heels on.

09:34.080 --> 09:35.960
I'm supposed to be seeing Alec.

09:37.040 --> 09:38.240
You can blame us.

09:40.640 --> 09:42.390
Oh. I'm sorry.

09:42.440 --> 09:46.430
He wants to toast my promotion
and he'll have already left work.

09:46.480 --> 09:48.960
Doesn't matter.
There's plenty of us going.

09:51.960 --> 09:53.470
You were lending it to me!

09:53.520 --> 09:55.510
To be presentable for a lecture,

09:55.560 --> 09:58.630
not lounging around
in some den of iniquity.

09:58.680 --> 10:00.190
I hardly think a port and lemon

10:00.240 --> 10:02.310
in the Hand & Shears is cause for
concern.

10:02.360 --> 10:04.160
Besides, goes with my lipstick.

10:08.080 --> 10:10.720
Have fun. And see you later.

10:14.440 --> 10:17.630
I hope the baby's not a brother
cos they just punch you!

10:17.680 --> 10:19.310
Hold still, Larry.

10:19.360 --> 10:21.590
But if the baby's a sister,

10:21.640 --> 10:23.270
they don't like pear drops,

10:23.320 --> 10:24.750
so you can eat 'em all.

10:24.800 --> 10:27.390
And George Hewitt says
they smell like Lux.

10:27.440 --> 10:29.190
Ain't you tired yet?

10:29.240 --> 10:33.870
Be a sister, be a sister,
be a sister! Please!

10:33.920 --> 10:34.960
Enough now, Larry.

10:36.560 --> 10:39.190
Come on, lads.
Stop jumping on the bed. Come on!

10:39.240 --> 10:41.910
Look what your old man's got for ya.
Eh?

10:41.960 --> 10:45.510
There you go. Go on, then.
Take 'em outside. Go and play.

10:45.560 --> 10:49.710
Look after the little 'un. I thought
haircuts was next month.

10:49.760 --> 10:51.550
How many did you do today, then?

10:51.600 --> 10:54.470
Er... five trims and a shave.

10:54.520 --> 10:57.070
You know no other bird goes round
cutting blokes' hair.

10:57.120 --> 10:59.800
You're making a joke out of me
down at the docks.

11:01.400 --> 11:02.440
Sit down.

11:05.520 --> 11:06.560
Talk to me.

11:07.920 --> 11:09.550
About what?

11:09.600 --> 11:11.390
I don't know. Small talk.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.990
Cyril, I ain't got no small talk!

11:13.040 --> 11:15.310
What did you talk to that
lot about this morning, then?

11:15.360 --> 11:17.790
That's nothing. That's just...

11:17.840 --> 11:18.960
Small talk.

11:24.120 --> 11:27.030
What was fascinating in these
regions was

11:27.080 --> 11:29.710
the absence of pain during labour,

11:29.760 --> 11:33.710
primarily because these women
did not expect it.

11:33.760 --> 11:36.160
They gave birth without fear.

11:39.080 --> 11:44.110
Compare this to our experience
of child birth -

11:44.160 --> 11:46.750
a time of pain and fear

11:46.800 --> 11:50.430
when a mother's instinct is dwarfed
by a well-meaning but patriarchal

11:50.480 --> 11:54.870
medical profession over-reliant on
mechanics and pain-relieving drugs.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.430
Will someone tell that man
to pipe down?!

11:59.480 --> 12:01.870
It's impossible to concentrate!

12:01.920 --> 12:03.190
Who is he?

12:03.240 --> 12:04.590
He's Dr Latham.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.270
He's carrying on the work
of Grantly Dick-Read,

12:07.320 --> 12:09.950
trying to make birth less
frightening.

12:10.000 --> 12:11.590
..Tightening the uterine muscles...

12:11.640 --> 12:14.480
Tally ho!
Catch him before he goes to ground!

12:16.280 --> 12:19.790
Tension directly affects delivery,

12:19.840 --> 12:21.630
causing pain and trauma to

12:21.680 --> 12:25.550
both mother and child and,
dare I say it, their future bond.

12:25.600 --> 12:27.990
Let us leave the knitting
for the duration of the lecture.

12:28.040 --> 12:31.550
Women's suffering is not
confined to birth alone!

12:31.600 --> 12:34.150
I hope you have a
solution for that as well.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.710
There will be
time for questions at the end.

12:36.760 --> 12:39.150
I should much prefer a lemon puff!

12:50.400 --> 12:51.950
You seem different.

12:52.000 --> 12:53.510
Oh? Mm.

12:53.560 --> 12:56.350
More authoritative, more commanding,

12:56.400 --> 12:58.430
the way you took
control of those crisps.

12:58.480 --> 13:00.470
Almost as if you've had a promotion.

13:00.520 --> 13:02.510
I'm hoping you've
laid on dancing till midnight

13:02.560 --> 13:05.230
and a carriage of white horses home.
It's the least I expect now.

13:05.280 --> 13:07.190
I'd hate to disappoint you.

13:07.240 --> 13:10.390
Just need to get rid of Bill
and Ben, the Disarmament Men.

13:10.440 --> 13:11.790
We're joining the march.

13:11.840 --> 13:13.070
What march?

13:13.120 --> 13:14.470
Alec, this is our evening!

13:14.520 --> 13:15.790
Ten minutes, I promise.

13:15.840 --> 13:18.350
Must have covered half of London.
I could murder a pint!

13:18.400 --> 13:20.030
And some pork scratchings.

13:20.080 --> 13:21.190
Students!

13:21.240 --> 13:24.070
Jenny, meet Bill Corbin
and Ben Myles -

13:24.120 --> 13:25.870
two young men that want to
change the world

13:25.920 --> 13:27.510
without ever buying a drink.

13:27.560 --> 13:30.350
Boys, I believe I may have mentioned
this young woman to you before?

13:30.400 --> 13:31.440
Only every day.

13:36.520 --> 13:37.750
So, what kind of march?

13:37.800 --> 13:40.670
The Campaign for Nuclear
Disarmament. We're banning the bomb.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.790
We're running low,
but you're welcome to have it.

13:43.840 --> 13:45.720
Oh, I couldn't possibly deprive you.

13:49.680 --> 13:51.190
Dr Latham,

13:51.240 --> 13:54.470
I have a very anxious
primigravida who recently

13:54.520 --> 13:56.390
lost her own mother.

13:56.440 --> 13:59.350
I think the idea of giving birth
without her is overwhelming.

13:59.400 --> 14:01.390
Yeah, well, I can see your concern.

14:01.440 --> 14:04.790
A crisis of confidence at a time
mythologised as one of strength,

14:04.840 --> 14:08.030
especially in a matriarchal
society like the East End.

14:08.080 --> 14:09.830
Ah, the heckler!

14:09.880 --> 14:12.790
That wasn't heckling or you'd be
lying down with a stiff gin.

14:12.840 --> 14:15.070
The nerve of this plagiarist!

14:15.120 --> 14:16.150
Lemon puff?

14:16.200 --> 14:17.190
I don't follow.

14:17.240 --> 14:21.550
"We become mad and delirious,
and fears and terrors assail us.

14:21.600 --> 14:24.790
"All these things we endure
from the brain."

14:24.840 --> 14:26.270
Hippocrates.

14:26.320 --> 14:28.320
2,500 years before you...

14:30.360 --> 14:31.400
..approximately.

14:33.960 --> 14:39.350
Dr Latham, we offer Mothercraft
sessions at our antenatal clinic.

14:39.400 --> 14:42.950
Would you consider discussing
your ideas on fear and birth?

14:43.000 --> 14:44.230
I'd be honoured.

14:44.280 --> 14:45.910
The East End fascinates me.

14:45.960 --> 14:49.190
It seems to exist in a world outside
of itself - preserved, if you like.

14:49.240 --> 14:50.840
I think it's called poverty.

14:52.440 --> 14:55.720
Make sure you get all of those
out. I'll see you soon.

14:58.680 --> 15:01.310
The boys literally
don't have a home to go to.

15:01.360 --> 15:04.590
There's about ten of them sharing
a bunk in Whitechapel and I'm pretty

15:04.640 --> 15:08.230
sure supper involves the bread
that the park ducks didn't eat.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.750
You know, I... I think
they rather look up to me.

15:10.800 --> 15:13.160
Which I'm sure you struggle with
terribly.

15:14.960 --> 15:16.000
Alec, I'm tired.

15:18.120 --> 15:21.270
Your friends are perfectly sweet
but I gave up tonight

15:21.320 --> 15:25.160
with my friends because I wanted
to see you, to spend time together.

15:27.520 --> 15:30.390
A few months ago, I'd have spent
night after night orchestrating our

15:30.440 --> 15:32.750
part in this march. I build things.

15:32.800 --> 15:34.990
I don't want to see them destroyed.

15:35.040 --> 15:37.080
And now I'm having
to MAKE myself care.

15:39.040 --> 15:41.030
Truth is,

15:41.080 --> 15:42.400
it's all gone out the window.

15:43.480 --> 15:46.110
All I care about is you.
It's maddening!

15:46.160 --> 15:47.200
Do stop talking.

15:53.080 --> 15:55.870
Where's my carriage of white horses?

15:55.920 --> 15:58.830
Well, I had a plan B - unicorns.

15:58.880 --> 16:02.470
But they're proving unreliable, too.
Mythic creatures always are.

16:02.520 --> 16:03.560
Aren't they?

16:11.080 --> 16:13.310
Look after yourselves.

16:13.360 --> 16:14.910
Right, off you go.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.000
Bye, Mum.

16:48.080 --> 16:51.230
Dr Latham calls it
"Nature's painkiller".

16:51.280 --> 16:54.670
Our breathing regulates our emotions
and that follows through to birth.

16:54.720 --> 16:56.870
Hello! Morning!

16:56.920 --> 16:59.510
The blood test results
are back from The London.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.670
Doctor Turner's seen them

17:00.720 --> 17:02.870
and asks if you'd pass on the good
news to Mrs Aston.

17:02.920 --> 17:04.240
Of course. Thank you.

17:05.520 --> 17:09.270
Oh, Sister Winifred will take
your patients when Dr Latham visits.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.910
How are preparations going?

17:10.960 --> 17:14.510
He needs certain items for his class.
Fred's collecting those.

17:14.560 --> 17:18.150
Just hope everyone finds it
as fascinating as I do.

17:18.200 --> 17:20.470
He's fitting us
in before he goes to Paris.

17:20.520 --> 17:22.190
And then he's off to America.

17:22.240 --> 17:26.109
New York, Paris, Poplar.
Not exactly a natural grouping.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.150
We'll mention it to
all our patients.

17:28.200 --> 17:30.430
First on the list should be
Doris Aston.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.750
There's something very
unsettled about her.

17:32.800 --> 17:35.750
She'd be a lot more relaxed
if her husband wasn't such a bully.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.790
A bully? Oh, jealous of any man
that looks at her.

17:38.840 --> 17:40.350
Hates that she works.

17:40.400 --> 17:41.950
I possibly shouldn't say,

17:42.000 --> 17:45.070
but Peter's had a few
contretemps with him.

17:45.120 --> 17:47.990
I believe one would certainly
call him hot-headed.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.470
Well, I wish you'd said!

17:49.520 --> 17:51.430
It might explain why she seems
so detached.

17:51.480 --> 17:54.590
You didn't think to ask.
You were too busy being bossy.

17:54.640 --> 17:57.710
If you call trying to do my job
being bossy...

17:57.760 --> 17:58.800
If the cap fits.

18:02.760 --> 18:04.680
Perhaps everyone should sign up.

18:19.400 --> 18:20.520
Mrs Aston?

18:26.640 --> 18:29.670
Mrs Aston, there you are!

18:29.720 --> 18:32.390
Good news on your blood test -
the anaemia's under control

18:32.440 --> 18:34.750
and your blood count's a healthy
11.5 grams.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.190
Sorry, Nurse. I'm in a hurry.
I've got customers waiting.

18:37.240 --> 18:38.230
Let me help you. Ooh!

18:38.280 --> 18:41.350
What have you got in there?
The kitchen sink? Just leave me be!

18:41.400 --> 18:42.590
Doris, what's the matter?

18:42.640 --> 18:44.230
I got to go away for a little bit.

18:44.280 --> 18:45.870
Just down to Brighton for a while.

18:45.920 --> 18:47.120
Doris, what are you doing?

18:48.720 --> 18:49.760
I needed that!

18:50.920 --> 18:52.550
I've got to go!

18:52.600 --> 18:54.950
You don't understand.
He'll finish me off.

18:55.000 --> 18:57.870
Has something happened?
I can't have it here.

18:57.920 --> 18:59.520
Come to the maternity home.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.160
It ain't his.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.030
I shouldn't be here.
It's very kind of you, but...

19:08.080 --> 19:10.230
Mrs Aston,
we want to be able to help you.

19:10.280 --> 19:11.790
You can't.

19:11.840 --> 19:14.990
How can you be so sure
about your husband?

19:15.040 --> 19:16.270
That he's not the father?

19:16.320 --> 19:18.270
I know.

19:18.320 --> 19:19.790
It's once in a blue moon.

19:19.840 --> 19:21.470
And then we...

19:21.520 --> 19:23.030
We use a rubber.

19:23.080 --> 19:26.150
I told him it must've leaked.
I ain't proud of it.

19:26.200 --> 19:29.110
What were you going to do,
when you got to Brighton?

19:29.160 --> 19:30.280
Leave the baby.

19:31.960 --> 19:36.150
Leave him somewhere he'd have nice
people, the life I can't give him.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.550
He'd kill me
if I went with any other fella.

19:38.600 --> 19:43.150
Forgive me, Mrs Aston, but unless
you tell him, how would he know?

19:43.200 --> 19:46.030
He wouldn't be the first man to
raise a child who was not his own.

19:46.080 --> 19:47.110
It ain't that simple.

19:47.160 --> 19:50.960
I'm not saying it's easy, but in the
long run, it may save a lot of pain.

19:51.960 --> 19:54.710
There's no reason why your husband
wouldn't love this child as...

19:54.760 --> 19:55.800
It's coloured.

19:59.720 --> 20:00.760
I can't hide it.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.230
He won't grow to love it.

20:04.280 --> 20:05.320
Now, do you see?

20:06.600 --> 20:08.750
What about the father?
Can you talk to him?

20:08.800 --> 20:11.350
It weren't no love story, Nurse.

20:11.400 --> 20:13.400
God knows what you must think of me!

20:15.080 --> 20:17.560
My husband can't ever see this baby.

20:19.040 --> 20:20.080
I can't keep it.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.840
We can find you a safe place
to give birth...

20:25.160 --> 20:26.870
..and if you mean adoption,

20:26.920 --> 20:29.790
we can help with arrangements,

20:29.840 --> 20:32.000
but you must be very
sure about this decision.

20:33.800 --> 20:34.840
It's two lives.

20:36.720 --> 20:39.880
One with my family
and another with...

20:47.920 --> 20:50.000
I missed the hot water. Again.

20:51.760 --> 20:54.430
Ice does wonders for the complexion.

20:54.480 --> 20:57.110
I just wanted a soak in the tub.

20:57.160 --> 20:58.320
It's been such a day.

21:01.680 --> 21:02.920
Trixie? Hm?

21:03.960 --> 21:06.080
The hot water's such a bore,
isn't it?

21:07.640 --> 21:10.480
No, I meant the day.
It's been terribly difficult.

21:12.960 --> 21:15.270
Trixie, I'm trying to talk to you!

21:15.320 --> 21:16.510
Hm?

21:16.560 --> 21:19.430
Yes, sorry.
I'm utterly lost in this.

21:19.480 --> 21:22.590
Well, I suppose with great
responsibility comes great

21:22.640 --> 21:24.510
sacrifice.

21:24.560 --> 21:25.960
Shoulders back and all that.

21:32.280 --> 21:34.270
The smell always reminds me of home.

21:34.320 --> 21:36.630
My mother was a formidable
rose grower.

21:36.680 --> 21:40.350
Why is it the English are
so very good with plants

21:40.400 --> 21:42.950
and so very poor with people?

21:43.000 --> 21:45.390
That's a little harsh, Sister.

21:45.440 --> 21:47.910
Especially as this is a Peace rose.

21:47.960 --> 21:50.430
I remember my mother telling me
about the day it was named,

21:50.480 --> 21:52.560
the same day Berlin fell.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.670
"The greatest new rose of our time

21:55.720 --> 21:59.760
"must be named for the world's
greatest desire - peace."

22:00.960 --> 22:04.990
And yet, here we are
with a greater threat -

22:05.040 --> 22:07.110
the atomic demon!

22:07.160 --> 22:12.200
"And there followed hail and fire
mingled with blood...

22:13.920 --> 22:16.790
"..and they were cast upon
the earth,

22:16.840 --> 22:19.920
"and the third part of trees
was burnt up."

22:21.600 --> 22:23.720
I've always skimmed Revelation.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.280
Find it rather grim.

22:28.280 --> 22:31.910
I simply hoped to bring us
a little closer to Nature.

22:31.960 --> 22:33.000
Well, you are.

22:35.800 --> 22:37.480
And we are in need of it.

22:41.560 --> 22:44.910
I mustered as many as I could
from the charity box at Nonnatus.

22:44.960 --> 22:48.150
I've got Dr Latham's accoutrements.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.750
Very grand.

22:49.800 --> 22:52.790
What you doing with all this stuff,
anyway? The art of relaxation.

22:52.840 --> 22:54.710
It's not for the unwary chap, Fred.

22:54.760 --> 22:56.710
Or, come to think of it,
chaps at all.

22:56.760 --> 22:59.080
Ignore her. Thank you.

23:00.600 --> 23:02.230
Oh, how charming!

23:02.280 --> 23:04.270
We could start
having knitting at Mothercraft.

23:04.320 --> 23:06.400
One can never have enough knitting.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.840
On second thoughts, perhaps one can.

23:10.880 --> 23:13.840
I don't think this little chap's
quite ready for the world.

23:24.120 --> 23:29.600
Oh, I must say, this relaxation lark
is absolutely top hole.

23:33.440 --> 23:35.190
She'll think the worst of me.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.670
Don't be nervous.

23:36.720 --> 23:40.190
Miss Ellaby's job, as moral welfare
worker, is to place baby

23:40.240 --> 23:43.200
with a family who can provide
the life you want for him.

23:44.920 --> 23:47.880
Miss Ellaby - Nurse Lee, Mrs Aston.

23:50.560 --> 23:53.880
By the look of things, we should
proceed as swiftly as we are able.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.710
At the Church
of England Infant Society,

23:57.760 --> 24:01.710
we advise a six-week placement
in one of our mother-and-baby homes.

24:01.760 --> 24:04.190
I understand this will not be
possible?

24:04.240 --> 24:07.910
Mrs Aston needs to return to her
family as soon as she is able.

24:07.960 --> 24:11.830
You are aware that children of mixed
blood are more difficult to place?

24:11.880 --> 24:15.470
We will collect from the cottage
hospital in Burnham-on-Crouch,

24:15.520 --> 24:17.710
where we've managed to book
Mrs Aston in.

24:17.760 --> 24:20.270
Where do they take the baby?

24:20.320 --> 24:22.670
Miss Ellaby, what arrangements
do you make from there?

24:22.720 --> 24:26.790
The child will be fostered
until suitable parents are found.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.870
It never ceases to lift the soul,

24:28.920 --> 24:31.830
the type of parents willing
to take on abandoned children.

24:31.880 --> 24:34.150
I'm not abandoning my baby!

24:34.200 --> 24:35.830
I don't have a choice, Miss.

24:35.880 --> 24:39.230
Isn't it more a case
of consequences, Mrs Aston?

24:39.280 --> 24:42.190
So much less palatable than
the actions that led to them.

24:42.240 --> 24:45.830
Then let us be grateful
we are not faced with them.

24:45.880 --> 24:48.440
And let us feel compassion
for those who are.

24:50.520 --> 24:52.550
We cover all of Poplar,

24:52.600 --> 24:55.830
and the new clinic means we can
provide better care to more women.

24:55.880 --> 24:58.030
Exactly what the National Health
should stand for!

24:58.080 --> 25:00.670
Good people doing good work.

25:00.720 --> 25:03.590
Mrs Short? This is Dr Latham.

25:03.640 --> 25:06.390
Mrs Short is the young woman
I mentioned when we first met.

25:06.440 --> 25:09.670
Ah. I don't think I quite have
the time today.

25:09.720 --> 25:12.310
I'll come back. Perhaps next time?

25:12.360 --> 25:15.790
We may have a lot to thank you for,
Mrs Short. Shall we begin?

25:15.840 --> 25:18.470
Blankets and pillows?
I should have brought me nightie!

25:18.520 --> 25:20.630
I should have brought me old man!

25:20.680 --> 25:22.590
Good morning, ladies.

25:22.640 --> 25:25.480
It is lovely to see
so many of you here.

25:26.920 --> 25:30.110
We're pleased to welcome Dr Latham.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.910
Thank you, thank you.

25:33.960 --> 25:35.000
Glad to be here.

25:36.800 --> 25:42.190
I hope to show you that our emotions
link directly to our physical being.

25:42.240 --> 25:44.710
A peaceful mind is a peaceful body,

25:44.760 --> 25:46.400
and thus to a peaceful birth.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.990
Birth, the great unmentionable.

25:51.040 --> 25:54.750
But I want to know your experiences
and concerns.

25:54.800 --> 25:58.910
How women truly think
and feel is vital to my work.

25:58.960 --> 26:02.600
Now, this is your body.

26:04.240 --> 26:07.120
It's not a miracle that you perform.
It's medical.

26:08.160 --> 26:11.040
You take away the mystery,
you take away the fear.

26:12.240 --> 26:14.120
What will you tell your husband?

26:16.320 --> 26:17.480
That I'm not well...

26:19.680 --> 26:21.110
..the anaemia,

26:21.160 --> 26:23.640
I need to go somewhere
I can be looked after.

26:26.440 --> 26:29.320
And when you come home
without the baby?

26:32.520 --> 26:33.560
That I lost it.

26:37.360 --> 26:39.160
How can it hurt so much already?

26:54.520 --> 26:58.430
It was the shock with my first.
I mean, no-one tells you, do they?

26:58.480 --> 26:59.910
Your body's never the same.

26:59.960 --> 27:01.760
I had forceps. That was a shock.

27:03.400 --> 27:05.990
If you'd been more relaxed,
you'd been less afraid.

27:06.040 --> 27:09.030
All that oxygen going to
your muscles helps them to stretch.

27:09.080 --> 27:13.390
When I saw the forceps, I couldn't
believe they was going inside me.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.710
Ooh!

27:14.760 --> 27:18.350
And that reaction, that shudder,
is what happens to your cervix.

27:18.400 --> 27:20.830
It tenses, holds on to baby,

27:20.880 --> 27:24.430
afraid to deliver it into a world
that doesn't feel safe.

27:24.480 --> 27:27.430
It's a powerful instinct at work.

27:27.480 --> 27:29.430
But we don't let it flourish,

27:29.480 --> 27:32.110
nor do we replace it
with information.

27:32.160 --> 27:34.440
Knowledge is power, ladies.

27:35.520 --> 27:38.190
Um... What are forceps?

27:38.240 --> 27:40.270
You'll know about 'em
if you need 'em.

27:40.320 --> 27:43.990
Think of medieval torture
and you're halfway there.

27:44.040 --> 27:48.550
Most births are completely normal.
Very few require forceps, Mrs Short.

27:48.600 --> 27:52.750
Well, my mum said having me
was no more trouble than sneezing.

27:54.640 --> 27:57.470
Oh, your mother allowed
Nature to take over.

27:57.520 --> 28:00.430
Remember that when your time comes.

28:00.480 --> 28:02.120
Right, shall we break for tea?

28:09.240 --> 28:12.830
Doris is giving her baby up for
adoption. Why didn't you tell me?

28:12.880 --> 28:14.190
It's been so quick.

28:14.240 --> 28:16.150
There's been time to tell
Sister Julienne,

28:16.200 --> 28:19.670
to get the adoption agency involved.
I saw the woman leaving.

28:19.720 --> 28:23.870
Jenny, this is an enormously hard
situation to deal with alone.

28:23.920 --> 28:26.750
I'm your friend. You would have
confided in me before...

28:26.800 --> 28:29.590
And I wanted to, but you've had such
a bee in your bonnet

28:29.640 --> 28:31.360
about this wretched promotion.

28:33.880 --> 28:36.400
Doris has to give up her baby
because it's black.

28:37.960 --> 28:40.350
I could have helped you.
I've been through this with Ted

28:40.400 --> 28:41.390
and Winnie Lawson.

28:41.440 --> 28:44.000
Can you really compare
Ted with Cyril Aston?

28:45.160 --> 28:47.080
How you and I feel doesn't matter.

28:53.640 --> 28:55.520
It's called a Peace rose...

28:58.760 --> 29:01.670
..though one feels it has yet to

29:01.720 --> 29:03.840
fully realise its properties.

29:12.000 --> 29:14.830
Nurse Miller, you mentioned
that you'd read my book?

29:14.880 --> 29:16.830
Think I know it word for word.

29:16.880 --> 29:20.160
Good because you are going to lead
the relaxation class.

29:21.360 --> 29:23.710
But they've come to see you!

29:23.760 --> 29:27.270
Because you persuaded them.
Because they trust you.

29:27.320 --> 29:29.070
I've no magic.

29:29.120 --> 29:31.430
This is all about instinct.

29:31.480 --> 29:32.520
Trust yours.

29:38.000 --> 29:41.800
Well, ladies, if you're comfortable,
then we'll begin.

29:43.080 --> 29:44.120
Lie back.

29:45.840 --> 29:48.160
Place your hands
gently on your stomach.

29:49.480 --> 29:51.470
Close your eyes.

29:51.520 --> 29:54.950
Feel your face
relax and breathe deeply,

29:55.000 --> 29:57.030
right into the bottom of your lungs.

29:57.080 --> 29:58.870
Feel your chest rising.

29:58.920 --> 30:00.870
Not in this girdle!

30:00.920 --> 30:02.950
Let go of all your worries.

30:03.000 --> 30:06.710
Let go of the cleaning, tomorrow's
dinner, the washing.

30:06.760 --> 30:10.070
There's no carrying shopping here,

30:10.120 --> 30:13.190
just breathing
and relaxing each muscle,

30:13.240 --> 30:14.720
the face, the neck.

30:16.000 --> 30:19.150
Relax your shoulders as you exhale,
Mrs Short.

30:19.200 --> 30:21.840
Be aware of your ribs
moving down as you breathe out.

30:24.120 --> 30:25.160
And in.

30:26.440 --> 30:27.480
And out.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.080
We got company?

30:40.240 --> 30:43.550
I got to go away for a little
while tomorrow.

30:43.600 --> 30:47.030
I got to be in a special hospital
for the baby cos of the anaemia.

30:47.080 --> 30:49.430
What you on about?
What's wrong with ya?

30:49.480 --> 30:52.000
I told you - the anaemia,
makes things difficult.

30:53.040 --> 30:55.750
How come you never said
nothing before?

30:55.800 --> 30:57.750
I didn't want to worry you.

30:57.800 --> 30:59.350
Where are you going?

30:59.400 --> 31:02.230
Out Essex way, in the country.

31:02.280 --> 31:03.950
For the air and that.

31:04.000 --> 31:06.750
I can't take no time off of work.
Who's going to look after the kids?

31:06.800 --> 31:08.670
I done you a stew.
Mum'll be staying.

31:08.720 --> 31:11.550
That's the cherry on the top,
that is.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.470
Won't be for long, Cyril.

31:13.520 --> 31:15.310
And I'm going to be better.

31:15.360 --> 31:16.720
That's what matters, isn't it?

31:20.160 --> 31:23.000
Goodbye. Thank you
so much for coming. Thank you.

31:25.840 --> 31:28.310
Try and find time each night
to practise.

31:28.360 --> 31:32.110
You'll sleep better and the
exercises will become second nature.

31:32.160 --> 31:34.680
I want that, Miss.
More than anything.

31:38.600 --> 31:41.150
Your patients are in good hands.

31:41.200 --> 31:42.830
I can't thank you enough for coming.

31:42.880 --> 31:44.910
The fact that you asked me
in the first place

31:44.960 --> 31:46.480
gives me every hope for the future.

31:47.560 --> 31:49.790
I shall keep in touch.

31:49.840 --> 31:53.200
I should like to see how you
take on the world, Nurse Miller.

31:55.760 --> 31:59.350
When you've finished huffing
and puffing, we expect every pillow

31:59.400 --> 32:02.640
and blanket returned
in the condition it left Nonnatus.

32:03.760 --> 32:06.230
And if you're suggesting
that a few deep breaths

32:06.280 --> 32:08.670
and not thinking about what's for
dinner is all there is to labour,

32:08.720 --> 32:11.880
you are leading your patients
up the fairy way.

32:32.120 --> 32:34.470
Told you there was nothing to it.

32:34.520 --> 32:35.790
Do you mind?

32:35.840 --> 32:37.760
I'm entering a meditative state.

32:41.680 --> 32:43.560
I hope you don't need a passport.

33:35.640 --> 33:37.110
See you after your holiday, then.

33:37.160 --> 33:38.320
Ain't no holiday.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.520
Larry? Larry, love?

33:44.000 --> 33:45.870
I need you to be a big boy.

33:45.920 --> 33:48.040
Larry, I need you to take
the other boys to school.

34:01.880 --> 34:02.990
Doris Aston is in labour.

34:03.040 --> 34:05.710
I don't think we'll have time to
move her to Burnham-on-Crouch.

34:05.760 --> 34:09.230
It's her fourth child. There's
a good chance labour will be swift.

34:09.280 --> 34:11.989
I'll speak to Miss Ellaby,
bring forward arrangements.

34:12.040 --> 34:13.080
You go to Doris.

34:14.840 --> 34:17.350
There's no pain like the separation
of mother and child.

34:17.400 --> 34:19.719
You'll need
all your strength for Doris.

34:49.360 --> 34:52.150
You got to get me away.
I can't have it here. I can't!

34:52.199 --> 34:53.909
I'm afraid you're going to have to.

34:53.960 --> 34:56.360
No time to move you
and baby wants to come.

34:58.760 --> 35:01.240
Doris, look at me.
I'm here, all right?

35:05.040 --> 35:08.470
That's it! That's it!
Good. Push for me!

35:08.520 --> 35:10.070
Push for me! That's it! Good.

35:10.120 --> 35:12.030
Keep that going. Keep that going.

35:12.080 --> 35:16.510
Keep it going, Doris! Good.
Good girl! That's really good!

35:16.560 --> 35:19.190
And now I want you to slow down
and pant. Pant!

35:22.480 --> 35:26.750
That's it! Good! Good!
Slowly, gently. All right?

35:26.800 --> 35:28.750
Good girl, good girl!

35:30.320 --> 35:32.670
The head's delivered, Doris!

35:32.720 --> 35:33.920
I want my baby.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.640
Doing wonderfully, Doris.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.320
One more push for me, all right?

35:47.560 --> 35:51.280
That's it! You can feel that!
Good, good. Good!

35:59.600 --> 36:00.590
It's a girl.

36:16.680 --> 36:17.720
There you are.

36:24.200 --> 36:25.280
My daughter!

36:29.960 --> 36:31.520
Her fingernails is white.

36:39.280 --> 36:41.400
I'm going to have to call Dr Turner.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.400
You've torn. Only a little,
but I do need him here.

36:47.040 --> 36:48.990
When does your husband get home?

36:49.040 --> 36:50.080
Not till evening.

36:52.520 --> 36:55.000
Sister Julienne is speaking
to Miss Ellaby.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.270
The adoption has to be
brought forward.

37:00.320 --> 37:04.790
Do you understand what that means,
Doris? Yes.

37:04.840 --> 37:06.720
It means I've got till they come.

37:13.480 --> 37:14.990
Nurse Miller?

37:15.040 --> 37:17.950
Mrs Short's gone into labour and,
according to her husband,

37:18.000 --> 37:20.790
"She must have Nurse Miller!"

37:20.840 --> 37:23.240
Get your coat and bag.
I'll meet you at the bicycles.

37:26.360 --> 37:27.680
I'll never forget you.

37:29.200 --> 37:30.240
Never.

37:32.240 --> 37:33.480
My beautiful girl.

37:36.280 --> 37:37.870
Remember me.

37:40.680 --> 37:41.750
That'll be Dr Turner.

37:47.040 --> 37:48.080
Mr Aston.

37:50.520 --> 37:51.550
You've had it?

37:51.600 --> 37:52.910
What are you doing here?

37:52.960 --> 37:54.230
You shouldn't be here.

37:54.280 --> 37:57.310
I had this feeling.
I... I needed to come back.

37:57.360 --> 37:58.440
I was scared for you.

38:02.640 --> 38:04.830
I wanted to tell you. I did.

38:04.880 --> 38:06.520
I wanted to tell you. Tell me?

38:09.080 --> 38:10.790
What you on about?

38:10.840 --> 38:13.070
Cyril, please
don't do nothing stupid.

38:13.120 --> 38:14.510
Please come away now, Mr Aston.

38:14.560 --> 38:15.910
What's the matter with you both?

38:15.960 --> 38:19.030
There's something wrong with it!
Why won't you let me see?

38:19.080 --> 38:21.600
Mr Aston, your...
Your wife needs to rest.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.630
There was once,

38:25.680 --> 38:26.670
just once.

38:26.720 --> 38:30.440
I swear I never looked at another
man before him.

38:41.040 --> 38:42.560
Please, let's go outside.

38:45.160 --> 38:46.200
You whore...

38:48.280 --> 38:50.430
You whore! My baby!
Please, Mr Aston!

38:50.480 --> 38:52.630
You went with another man,
you bitch!

38:52.680 --> 38:56.230
I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
Cyril, I'm trying to make it right.

38:56.280 --> 39:00.470
My wife...with a coloured bastard!

39:00.520 --> 39:02.710
She's mine! She's mine!
Yeah, well, that ain't mine!

39:02.760 --> 39:04.830
You leave her alone this instant!

39:04.880 --> 39:07.950
Now, you go somewhere
and you cool off. Do you hear me?

39:08.000 --> 39:12.150
Cool off? Calm down! Because I will
call the police, Mr Aston.

39:12.200 --> 39:13.640
Be in no doubt about that.

39:19.240 --> 39:20.280
Get rid of it...

39:21.880 --> 39:23.120
..or I swear I will.

39:47.080 --> 39:50.750
So soon? She's only just
recovering from the birth.

39:50.800 --> 39:54.270
And what if Mr Aston
should come back tonight?

39:54.320 --> 39:55.960
We can't take that risk.

39:57.680 --> 39:59.830
Shelagh and I
will look after the baby

39:59.880 --> 40:02.480
until Miss Ellaby
can secure foster parents.

40:04.480 --> 40:06.150
I don't want to take her baby.

40:06.200 --> 40:07.720
Nobody wants this.

40:09.320 --> 40:11.400
But we have to make sure
baby is safe.

40:12.560 --> 40:13.960
And she isn't safe here.

40:16.600 --> 40:18.960
If you can't, I will.

40:32.280 --> 40:33.320
Doris.

40:40.840 --> 40:42.760
I'm so very sorry, but it's time.

40:45.680 --> 40:46.720
Carole.

40:48.640 --> 40:50.440
She looks like a Carole, don't she?

41:01.480 --> 41:03.120
She's very beautiful.

41:08.280 --> 41:11.070
Doctor Turner and his wife,

41:11.120 --> 41:13.200
they'll shelter Carole tonight...

41:14.680 --> 41:17.000
..until Miss Ellaby
can make arrangements.

41:27.320 --> 41:30.160
I need to move Carole to where
she can be safe.

42:34.680 --> 42:36.270
Home straights now, Nellie.

42:36.320 --> 42:37.800
Just going to examine you.

42:43.400 --> 42:44.560
Don't push, Nellie.

42:46.080 --> 42:48.110
Nurse Miller, what is it?

42:48.160 --> 42:51.350
Baby's OP
and we're only two fingers dilated.

42:51.400 --> 42:55.270
The pain, Nurse!
Something's wrong, isn't it?

42:55.320 --> 42:58.030
Baby's in a different position,
Nellie. That's why you're

42:58.080 --> 43:01.110
feeling the urge to push.
He's pressing on your back passage.

43:01.160 --> 43:03.310
But you can't push. Not yet.

43:03.360 --> 43:05.790
Ooh! What does that mean?

43:05.840 --> 43:07.510
Not the forceps!

43:07.560 --> 43:11.510
Please! Promise me, Nurse.
I don't want no interference.

43:11.560 --> 43:12.550
Promise me!

43:12.600 --> 43:15.680
We'll do all we can to avoid it.
Nurse?

43:18.120 --> 43:20.110
Don't make promises you can't keep!

43:20.160 --> 43:23.030
That's the trouble with a little
knowledge. It's a dangerous thing.

43:23.080 --> 43:26.270
We need to get her
into the maternity home.

43:26.320 --> 43:30.070
I want my mum!
She promised she'd be here for me.

43:30.120 --> 43:31.910
Nellie, we're with you.

43:31.960 --> 43:36.150
Surely we can try and help Nellie
give birth the way she wants to?

43:39.000 --> 43:42.550
But she's not doing anything
without 100 milligrams of pethidine.

43:42.600 --> 43:46.750
And if I sense one hint of risk,
we're calling Doctor Turner!

43:48.720 --> 43:51.830
Sh! Now, close your eyes, Nellie.

43:51.880 --> 43:54.790
I'll draw the curtains to make
the room more peaceful.

43:54.840 --> 43:59.790
Take that deep breath
and feel it moving through you.

43:59.840 --> 44:02.190
Now come on. With me.

44:02.240 --> 44:04.070
Out and in.

44:04.120 --> 44:05.950
And out.

44:06.000 --> 44:07.710
And in.

44:07.760 --> 44:09.760
And out. That's it.

44:11.120 --> 44:14.670
Surely not! It couldn't be!
But that did look like a smile.

44:14.720 --> 44:16.360
You know, it's probably wind.

44:18.800 --> 44:20.190
Ooh!

44:20.240 --> 44:25.350
Now, that was a smile for me!
Definitely for me.

44:25.400 --> 44:29.110
I've held so many babies,
helped them with their first breath,

44:29.160 --> 44:31.430
put them in their mother's arms.

44:31.480 --> 44:34.230
I want the next baby
I hold to be ours.

44:34.280 --> 44:36.000
I don't want to let go any more.

44:38.800 --> 44:42.550
You're giving away Cuthbert?
You've had him since you were born.

44:42.600 --> 44:45.360
I want Carole to have him.
She can look after him.

44:46.960 --> 44:48.470
I'm too old for him now.

44:48.520 --> 44:50.430
I wasn't going to say anything.

44:50.480 --> 44:52.110
Couldn't she stay?

44:52.160 --> 44:55.550
There's a family out there
who don't have any children.

44:55.600 --> 44:57.750
They're waiting for her.

44:57.800 --> 45:00.670
She's going to make such
a difference to their lives.

45:00.720 --> 45:02.270
But what about our lives?

45:02.320 --> 45:04.640
Oh, I think
we're going to be all right.

45:18.760 --> 45:21.830
She hasn't got the strength
she'll need to get this baby out.

45:21.880 --> 45:25.830
It's been seven hours
and she's still not fully dilated.

45:25.880 --> 45:29.510
This is not right! Please, Sister!
Just a little more time.

45:29.560 --> 45:32.310
Her mind is calm and her body will
start to relax, too.

45:32.360 --> 45:36.550
I won't take risks with mother
or child. Neither will I.

45:40.120 --> 45:44.550
Feel your chest relaxing
and the oxygen coming to your womb.

45:44.600 --> 45:46.310
Give me strength!

45:46.360 --> 45:47.990
Just need to see how you're doing.

45:55.440 --> 45:56.520
Fully dilated.

45:57.960 --> 46:01.750
All right now, Nellie. We need you
up because of the position of baby,

46:01.800 --> 46:04.110
and we need you to push.

46:04.160 --> 46:05.150
You said not to.

46:05.200 --> 46:07.870
Now you need to give it some oomph,
my girl!

46:07.920 --> 46:10.710
And it helps
if you pull against something.

46:10.760 --> 46:12.360
And that something is me.

46:13.760 --> 46:15.310
Yes! Come on!

46:20.120 --> 46:22.400
Nana says we mustn't say nothing.

46:24.360 --> 46:25.800
Is she in heaven, Mum?

46:27.120 --> 46:29.160
Larry, give me a cuddle, please.

46:31.120 --> 46:33.390
One day we'll get a sister,

46:33.440 --> 46:34.480
won't we, Mum?

46:43.280 --> 46:46.390
Think of each contraction
as your womb taking a breath,

46:46.440 --> 46:48.920
breathing your baby down towards
the birth canal.

46:50.080 --> 46:52.430
We're nearly there, Nellie.

46:52.480 --> 46:54.110
Keep going!

46:54.160 --> 46:56.110
Come on now!

46:56.160 --> 46:58.760
This goes on much longer,
she'll be past the point of pushing.

47:00.160 --> 47:02.270
Nellie? Nellie?

47:02.320 --> 47:04.400
What would your mother
tell you to do?

47:13.440 --> 47:17.390
That's it! That's it!

47:17.440 --> 47:18.600
Big push!

47:20.240 --> 47:22.230
Now, pant now, Nellie.
Pant, pant, pant!

47:25.960 --> 47:27.880
Head is born. Sunny side up!

47:30.040 --> 47:33.240
All right now, Nellie.
Now, one more big push!

47:48.960 --> 47:50.030
It's a boy.

47:57.040 --> 48:00.760
You wanted to see the world straight
away, didn't you, little one?

48:02.760 --> 48:03.920
Cos you're brave...

48:05.400 --> 48:07.510
..just like your mum.

48:21.760 --> 48:22.880
You did it, Nellie.

48:24.280 --> 48:25.320
Well done.

48:31.920 --> 48:33.120
Thank you.

48:34.400 --> 48:35.440
For everything.

48:41.560 --> 48:42.600
I love you, Mum.

48:51.720 --> 48:56.510
I never thought I'd say this, but
I'm glad you didn't listen to me.

48:56.560 --> 48:59.230
You should be proud of yourself,
Nurse Miller.

48:59.280 --> 49:03.720
You did it your own way, a new way,
and you were right to.

49:04.720 --> 49:05.760
Thank you.

49:07.880 --> 49:09.960
Oh, I shall sleep well tonight.

49:11.400 --> 49:13.230
In.

49:13.280 --> 49:14.630
And out.

49:17.320 --> 49:18.360
And in.

49:22.760 --> 49:23.800
Any tenderness?

49:33.800 --> 49:35.080
Anything?

49:43.000 --> 49:44.720
Everything's normal, Doris.

49:48.720 --> 49:51.550
I brought you some Epsom Salts

49:51.600 --> 49:54.800
to help dry up your milk
when it comes.

49:56.600 --> 49:58.600
Milk's all I got to remember her by.

50:03.840 --> 50:05.750
Will you help me?

50:05.800 --> 50:06.840
Course I will.

50:11.320 --> 50:13.400
She's got nothing to remember me by.

50:15.560 --> 50:19.320
I'm her mother
but she's never going to know that.

50:22.760 --> 50:24.200
So, I wrote a letter.

50:26.160 --> 50:27.520
Will you take it to her?

50:31.800 --> 50:35.070
'On one piece of paper,
Doris crammed the love

50:35.120 --> 50:37.910
'she hoped would last a lifetime.

50:37.960 --> 50:40.910
'All that she would miss -
the first tooth,

50:40.960 --> 50:44.270
'the first day of school,
the talks they would have had,

50:44.320 --> 50:46.120
'the love they would have shared.

50:48.760 --> 50:51.910
'She trusted in God
that Carole would

50:51.960 --> 50:53.470
'have a good life

50:53.520 --> 50:57.920
'with good people who would give her
daughter the future she couldn't.

50:59.080 --> 51:02.110
'More than anything, she wished
she could have kept her

51:02.160 --> 51:04.430
'because whatever anyone
else might feel,

51:04.480 --> 51:07.030
'it couldn't be what Doris felt.

51:07.080 --> 51:09.630
'Her daughter was of and from her.

51:09.680 --> 51:12.640
'They were a part of each other
and always would be.'

51:14.960 --> 51:16.000
How is Mrs Aston?

51:17.360 --> 51:18.400
Not good.

51:20.200 --> 51:22.350
I can't let go of her.

51:22.400 --> 51:24.320
I don't know how her mother could.

51:25.680 --> 51:28.190
We do try.
We do our best to make this

51:28.240 --> 51:30.350
as speedy and painless as possible.

51:30.400 --> 51:33.990
Paperwork, as always,
is a necessary evil

51:34.040 --> 51:36.360
and then we may all
go about our business.

51:38.880 --> 51:41.750
We've secured good parents,

51:41.800 --> 51:43.390
a couple from Durham.

51:43.440 --> 51:45.440
He's a lecturer at the university.

51:46.600 --> 51:49.190
The child will want for nothing.

51:49.240 --> 51:50.480
Goodbye, little one.

51:52.400 --> 51:53.440
God bless you.

52:03.840 --> 52:08.390
Miss Ellaby, I have a letter
from Mrs Aston to her daughter

52:08.440 --> 52:10.510
for when she's old
enough to understand.

52:10.560 --> 52:14.070
She wants to make it clear it was
circumstances, not lack of love.

52:14.120 --> 52:15.670
I'm sorry, Sister Lee.

52:15.720 --> 52:18.760
In this case, the parents request
no onward contact.

52:34.280 --> 52:37.390
We will take the letter
and keep it safe.

52:37.440 --> 52:39.230
If Carole searches for her
mother one day,

52:39.280 --> 52:41.550
hopefully, records will
bring her to us.

52:41.600 --> 52:43.790
Miss Ellaby spoke of the parents

52:43.840 --> 52:46.430
as if Doris had no
link at all with her baby.

52:46.480 --> 52:50.310
When I was a child,
I would write to Father Christmas.

52:50.360 --> 52:53.350
I would put down my many wants,

52:53.400 --> 52:56.360
mostly chocolate and cake.

52:57.640 --> 53:00.350
My father would send
the letter up the chimney

53:00.400 --> 53:02.310
and as far as I was aware,

53:02.360 --> 53:04.990
into the hands of Father Christmas.

53:05.040 --> 53:06.710
Not sure I follow.

53:06.760 --> 53:08.750
With the greatest respect,
Sister Monica Joan,

53:08.800 --> 53:12.470
you can't compare this letter
to your note to Santa Claus.

53:12.520 --> 53:15.950
I think what Sister is
saying is that sometimes, the act

53:16.000 --> 53:19.280
of letter-writing is as important
as the receipt of the letter.

53:20.640 --> 53:24.830
Tell Doris we will take care of what
she has needed to say.

53:24.880 --> 53:29.040
And if Carole needs to hear those
words, she will find us.

53:35.320 --> 53:36.360
So, you're back?

53:39.360 --> 53:40.400
It's gone, then?

53:42.640 --> 53:44.640
She. Not "it".

53:47.480 --> 53:49.190
Blame me, Cyril. I cheated.

53:49.240 --> 53:52.190
I done this. Hate me
and I wouldn't blame you.

53:52.240 --> 53:53.280
But not her.

54:00.400 --> 54:01.560
Are any of them mine?

54:06.640 --> 54:07.680
You know they are.

54:15.440 --> 54:17.600
Could you rinse it again?
It's got egg on it.

54:19.520 --> 54:21.790
I'm sorry. I'm doing it again,
aren't I?

54:21.840 --> 54:24.630
I don't mean to be bossy.
I'm just trying to do my best.

54:24.680 --> 54:26.590
You're doing brilliantly, Jenny.

54:26.640 --> 54:29.350
I couldn't have gone through what
you did with Doris.

54:29.400 --> 54:30.910
You could.

54:30.960 --> 54:32.160
We all could...

54:33.400 --> 54:35.630
..cos it's not about us, is it?

54:35.680 --> 54:37.110
Mother and baby first.

54:37.160 --> 54:38.750
Always.

54:38.800 --> 54:41.910
But don't underestimate yourself,
Sister.

54:41.960 --> 54:44.830
Even if you do wear that
ridiculous hat.

54:44.880 --> 54:47.350
Least I don't pretend to be
a natural blonde!

54:47.400 --> 54:49.630
No pretence, I can assure you.

54:49.680 --> 54:51.550
My mother said
I was born with a halo.

54:51.600 --> 54:55.310
Doris must be confused.
She was sure she dyed your hair.

54:55.360 --> 54:56.400
Outrageous!

55:14.680 --> 55:15.720
Change your mind?

55:17.040 --> 55:18.310
Come and march for peace.

55:18.360 --> 55:20.630
I'm afraid my mind is
completely my own.

55:20.680 --> 55:22.310
And what about your heart?

55:22.360 --> 55:23.840
I think I'd like to share that.

55:25.840 --> 55:27.670
Shouldn't it be me
giving you flowers?

55:27.720 --> 55:30.430
Well, now that you mention it...

55:30.480 --> 55:32.230
It's a Peace rose.

55:32.280 --> 55:34.080
My contribution to your march.

55:38.840 --> 55:41.310
I know, I know. Now, you have
your work to do.

55:41.360 --> 55:42.880
My work and my vocation.

56:02.840 --> 56:05.320
Are you planning on going
back to your work?

56:09.320 --> 56:13.070
Doris, you have
to stop punishing yourself.

56:13.120 --> 56:15.640
You have three other children
who depend on you.

56:16.840 --> 56:18.640
You can't hide for ever.

56:45.880 --> 56:48.190
Just to the shop and back.

56:48.240 --> 56:49.230
I can't. I ain't ready.

56:49.280 --> 56:51.230
And you won't be ready tomorrow
or the day after,

56:51.280 --> 56:54.030
but this is your home, Doris,
where your children go to school,

56:54.080 --> 56:56.600
where your friends are
and where you will work again.

56:58.760 --> 56:59.880
Penny sweets, Mum?

57:15.200 --> 57:16.910
Doris, how are you?

57:16.960 --> 57:18.030
Nurse.

57:18.080 --> 57:20.510
I'm fine, Lizzie. Thanks for asking.

57:20.560 --> 57:22.990
Well, what do you have, then?
Boy or girl?

57:23.040 --> 57:25.670
And where is it? Where's the baby?

57:25.720 --> 57:26.800
I, um...

57:28.680 --> 57:32.470
It's been quite... No-one's even
heard a cry! Lucky you, I say.

57:32.520 --> 57:35.550
Mrs Aston's had a rather
difficult...

57:35.600 --> 57:36.640
No baby.

57:40.000 --> 57:41.040
No baby.

57:44.680 --> 57:46.030
Excuse me.

57:46.080 --> 57:50.550
MUSIC: "You Always Hurt the One
You Love" by Connie Francis

57:50.600 --> 57:54.030
'The beginning of life drove us
to be strong throughout it

57:54.080 --> 57:57.870
'and to accept the consequences
our actions brought us.

57:57.920 --> 58:02.030
'In those acts of instinct
and courage we found a freedom

58:02.080 --> 58:03.750
'and it made us bold.

'It made us believe

My Fair Lady, Drury Lane,
Saturday night.

58:19.680 --> 58:22.230
You needn't come
if it isn't manly enough for you.

58:22.280 --> 58:25.150
I'd come to a meeting of the WI
if you were going to be there.

58:25.200 --> 58:27.390
Well, I dare say it will be quite
fascinating to be

58:27.440 --> 58:29.510
surrounded by hardened criminals.

58:29.560 --> 58:32.590
Most of the women who are locked
up are charged with petty theft,

58:32.640 --> 58:34.350
fraud, prostitution.

58:34.400 --> 58:38.030
But one thing's for sure.
It is no place to have a baby.

58:38.080 --> 58:41.150
If they think I'm an unfit mother,
they'll take my baby, won't they?

58:41.200 --> 58:43.190
We can't save everyone.
But she isn't everyone.
