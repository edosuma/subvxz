I have seen what
their ultimate weapon
has done to our people.

16:22.375 --> 16:25.875
Omega Red must be stopped.

16:25.875 --> 16:27.375
Then let’s do it!

16:36.166 --> 16:39.875
Whirlwind, deliver them!

16:44.708 --> 16:46.625
(WIND WHOOSHING)

16:46.625 --> 16:48.250
(SOLDIERS SCREAMING)

16:51.000 --> 16:52.166
(GROANS)

16:59.416 --> 17:01.000
Wolverine
has brought allies.

17:04.166 --> 17:05.625
(GAMBIT GRUNTS)

17:05.625 --> 17:07.000
Let him go!

17:13.416 --> 17:15.625
One mutant or 100,

17:15.625 --> 17:19.958
they shall all bow
before the great
Soviet Empire.

17:31.250 --> 17:34.000
Where’d you come from,
you tin squid!

17:34.000 --> 17:38.333
You are the strongest
of Wolverine’s
mutant friends.

17:38.333 --> 17:42.958
I want you all to see
that none are safe
from my tentacles.

17:42.958 --> 17:45.375
You’re mine, Red!

17:45.375 --> 17:49.583
Forgot about
my Carbonadium armor,
didn’t you?

17:49.583 --> 17:53.750
Well, you scratch my back,
and I’ll scratch yours!

17:53.750 --> 17:56.208
(WEAKLY) I won’t let you.

18:02.458 --> 18:03.458
(GROANS)

18:06.625 --> 18:10.125
Our country is through
with empires, Omega Red.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.125
(GROANING)

18:14.458 --> 18:17.375
For 25 years
they imprisoned me.

18:19.166 --> 18:20.250
No!

18:20.250 --> 18:22.708
They were right to fear me.

18:22.708 --> 18:27.208
(GRUNTING)
You will be stopped.

18:29.000 --> 18:31.875
I cannot be.
I shall not be.

18:31.875 --> 18:36.458
Mutant! You command the winds.
Do you also command the cold?

18:36.458 --> 18:37.875
Yes.

18:37.875 --> 18:40.750
The deepest cold
held Omega Red prisoner.

18:40.750 --> 18:42.708
Perhaps it can
still stop him.

18:44.583 --> 18:46.333
What?

18:46.333 --> 18:47.708
No!

18:47.708 --> 18:51.708
Forces of nature’s cold,
freeze!

18:51.708 --> 18:53.500
Witch!

18:55.458 --> 18:57.875
Fools! When will you...

18:58.958 --> 19:01.875
(OMEGA RED GRUNTING)

19:01.875 --> 19:07.083
COLOSSUS: Storm!
Your cold hurt him! Now!
With all your strength!

19:09.208 --> 19:13.583
Ice, winds, storms!

19:13.583 --> 19:17.208
No, not again.

19:18.291 --> 19:20.833
For another lifetime.

19:20.833 --> 19:25.291
Do not stop!
Take us both!

19:25.291 --> 19:27.750
I shall not...

19:35.375 --> 19:37.416
Be gone!

19:38.958 --> 19:40.250
(GRUNTING)

19:44.958 --> 19:48.000
Piotr!
You’ve done it!

19:48.000 --> 19:49.625
You’ve stopped him!

19:49.625 --> 19:51.208
COLOSSUS:
Yes, Illyana.

19:51.208 --> 19:52.416
We are free.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.000
For now.

19:56.208 --> 19:58.375
Soon it will be
as it was!

19:58.375 --> 20:01.375
DARKSTAR:
It will never again
be as it was.

20:01.375 --> 20:03.708
Your army has been defeated,

20:03.708 --> 20:07.583
and your monster has been
returned to the ice
from which he came.

20:07.583 --> 20:13.583
A new day has dawned.
Your night
of terror is over.

20:13.583 --> 20:17.708
With Omega Red back on ice,
why don’t you
come back with us?

20:17.708 --> 20:20.500
Thank you, my friend,
but this is my home.

20:20.500 --> 20:23.750
We must rebuild
what Omega Red destroyed.

20:25.583 --> 20:29.458
At least come and visit.
I can fly you over.

20:29.458 --> 20:32.083
Well, perhaps.

20:34.875 --> 20:38.458
Piotr, is the terror
really over?

20:38.458 --> 20:42.250
Yes.
Thanks to such friends
as the X-Men.
