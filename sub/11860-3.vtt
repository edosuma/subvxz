WEBVTT

00:03.834 --> 00:06.750
Uh, Mr. Caceres
is looking at car theft

00:06.834 --> 00:08.542
'assault, eluding police.'

00:08.625 --> 00:10.875
Uh, Your Honor,
Alex is a good
kid.

00:10.959 --> 00:13.291
Mr. Caceres
was in front of this court

00:13.375 --> 00:15.917
on drug trafficking charges
less than six months ago.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.583
Because he was forced
to mule drugs

00:17.667 --> 00:19.125
for his previous foster parents.

00:19.208 --> 00:21.709
His father's been
incarcerated
since he was an infant.

00:21.792 --> 00:24.250
His mother and his brother
were killed two years ago.

00:24.333 --> 00:26.333
If you could just
let Alex explain.

00:27.959 --> 00:29.458
(male #1)
'Thirty seconds, Mr.
Caceres.'

00:30.834 --> 00:32.375
[clears
throat]
Judge..

00:32.458 --> 00:34.417
Your-Your Honor, sir..

00:34.500 --> 00:37.083
I-I took my foster father's
car
for a ride.

00:37.166 --> 00:40.458
I-I know I was wrong.
Just...needed to get away.

00:40.542 --> 00:42.542
Does that explain your
foster father's broken wrist?

00:42.625 --> 00:44.625
He tried to hit me. I got
scared, moved out of the way.

00:44.709 --> 00:48.333
The DA recommends
a suspended sentence.

00:48.417 --> 00:49.792
'I'm not so inclined.'

00:49.875 --> 00:51.333
'Mr. Caceres needs to learn'

00:51.417 --> 00:52.792
the consequences of his actions.

00:52.875 --> 00:55.125
Your Honor, I have
a decorated police
detective

00:55.208 --> 00:58.583
ready to testify on behalf
of Alex's character.

00:58.667 --> 00:59.959
He must be running
a little late.

01:00.041 --> 01:01.583
So am I.

01:01.667 --> 01:04.125
Eighteen months
at Havenhurst Academy.

01:04.208 --> 01:05.417
'Approach the bench,
Mr. Caceres.'

01:24.250 --> 01:25.458
It's over?

01:25.542 --> 01:27.583
Hang 'Em High Harry
never goes past two minutes.

01:27.667 --> 01:30.000
- Where were you?
- I got caught up.

01:30.083 --> 01:31.166
Don't tell me.

01:32.834 --> 01:35.125
- Alex..
- It's cool, Detective
Valens.

01:35.208 --> 01:37.500
They're taking me
to this Havenhurst place.

01:37.583 --> 01:38.792
Can't be worse
than foster care, right?

01:38.875 --> 01:40.875
Hey, look, uh, I'm gonna
talk to the judge.

01:42.792 --> 01:43.917
Hey, Alex.

01:45.291 --> 01:47.208
I got your back, okay?

02:21.291 --> 02:23.959
Jamal wouldn't step off.
Up in Franco's grill.

02:24.041 --> 02:25.083
Franco put two in his.

02:25.166 --> 02:26.125
Bam, bam.

02:26.208 --> 02:27.667
Just left him there.

02:27.750 --> 02:29.208
(Rush)
'A colorful story, Michael.'

02:29.291 --> 02:31.875
The thing is,
Jamal was shot in the
chest.

02:31.959 --> 02:33.875
Booked the doer last week.
It wasn't Franco.

02:33.959 --> 02:35.375
Look, you're up on petty theft.

02:35.458 --> 02:37.709
I mean, doin' three months.
Why yank our chain?

02:37.792 --> 02:39.625
They're sending me
to Havenhurst. I can't go
back.

02:39.709 --> 02:41.917
We're homicide, not concierge.

02:42.000 --> 02:45.000
You don't help,
gonna be a homicide, mine.

02:45.083 --> 02:47.083
They'll do me
like they did
Alex.

02:47.166 --> 02:48.458
(Rush)
'Alex who?'

02:49.625 --> 02:50.667
Caceres.

02:51.542 --> 02:53.458
Hey, that was an accident.

02:53.542 --> 02:54.583
You know who he's talking about?

02:54.667 --> 02:55.875
(Michael)
'Said he slipped.'

02:55.959 --> 02:57.542
But I found him.

02:57.625 --> 02:59.083
Bruises all over.

02:59.166 --> 03:00.417
Wrists had marks
like he was tied
up.

03:00.500 --> 03:01.750
I read the coroner's report.

03:01.834 --> 03:03.417
There was nothin'
about bruisin'.

03:03.500 --> 03:04.667
I know what I saw.

03:04.750 --> 03:06.792
You're saying someone
at Havenhurst killed
him

03:06.875 --> 03:08.291
and made it look
like an accident?

03:09.834 --> 03:11.041
He talked about you.

03:11.125 --> 03:12.834
And you make up
that crap about Jamal

03:12.917 --> 03:14.083
to get me in the room?

03:14.166 --> 03:15.792
Didn't even know
if you'd remember
him.

03:15.875 --> 03:17.250
Yeah, well, I do, so talk.

03:18.667 --> 03:20.000
I ain't saying another
word
unless you're gonna

03:20.083 --> 03:21.375
keep me out of Havenhurst.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.166
Got your back, Michael.

03:26.250 --> 03:28.500
You said the same thing
to Alex..

03:28.583 --> 03:30.083
...and look what happened
to him.

04:09.542 --> 04:12.083
Alex died
of a subdural hematoma.

04:12.166 --> 04:13.458
Havenhurst said
it was an accident.

04:13.542 --> 04:14.500
Well, accidents happen.

04:14.583 --> 04:15.542
Yeah, well, this one happens

04:15.625 --> 04:16.667
in the middle of the night.

04:16.750 --> 04:18.125
No one heard a thing,
the next morning

04:18.208 --> 04:19.166
they moved him out of his room

04:19.250 --> 04:20.375
before the cops got there.

04:20.458 --> 04:21.792
- Wasn't it investigated?
- Yeah.

04:21.875 --> 04:23.625
ME called it a slip
and fall, and that's that.

04:23.709 --> 04:25.000
Thing is, ME was a hack.

04:25.083 --> 04:27.125
Scotty, overtime has
been cut to the bone.

04:27.208 --> 04:29.000
Deputy commissioner
is breathing down my
neck.

04:29.083 --> 04:31.166
Come on, boss,
you're gonna let a tool bag

04:31.250 --> 04:32.834
like Doherty
back you off a case?

04:32.917 --> 04:34.333
- I don't see a case here.
- Well, I didn't either.

04:34.417 --> 04:36.333
Till I found the autopsy photos.

04:36.417 --> 04:37.875
I'd never seen them before.

04:37.959 --> 04:41.417
The bruising consistent
with a physical altercation.

04:41.500 --> 04:43.333
'These marks on the wrists
look like restraints.'

04:43.417 --> 04:45.667
- You're thinking abuse.
- It wouldn't be the first.

04:45.750 --> 04:46.959
I mean, you know, uh..

04:47.041 --> 04:48.792
...private facilities
like this are..

04:48.875 --> 04:50.125
...barely regulated.

04:52.041 --> 04:53.750
I should have looked
closer back then.

04:59.125 --> 05:01.041
What does this kid mean
to you, Scotty?

05:02.333 --> 05:06.583
[sighs]
A few years back
in Narcotics..

05:07.959 --> 05:09.583
...Alex's mother
was gonna testify

05:09.667 --> 05:11.834
against a dealer
in a case of
mine.

05:13.041 --> 05:15.083
(Alex)
'Detective V,
wh-what's it take'

05:15.166 --> 05:16.542
to get a snack around here?

05:16.625 --> 05:18.709
If I can't get some change
for the vending machine

05:18.792 --> 05:21.000
I'm gonna sue
for police brutality.

05:24.208 --> 05:25.625
Uh, I'm just playin'.

05:25.709 --> 05:27.041
You know I got much love
for Philly's finest.

05:27.125 --> 05:28.166
Alex.

05:29.750 --> 05:30.834
Something happened.

05:35.083 --> 05:39.041
His mom and ten-year-old
brother
were killed in a drive-by.

05:41.792 --> 05:43.917
I transferred out of Narco.

05:44.000 --> 05:45.750
Tried to look after Alex, but..

05:45.834 --> 05:48.792
You sure this isn't
the guilt talking, Scotty?

05:48.875 --> 05:51.417
A kid like Michael's
been
in the worst
facilities

05:51.500 --> 05:53.500
and Havenhurst terrifies him.

05:54.375 --> 05:55.583
I mean, something's up.

05:55.667 --> 05:57.417
Alright, on the QT, Scotty.

05:59.291 --> 06:00.667
Keep it small.

06:05.500 --> 06:07.625
(male #2)
'Uh, we don't think of our
kids
as offenders.'

06:07.709 --> 06:10.125
They need a chance
to work out their
problems.

06:10.208 --> 06:11.709
We give them a voice.

06:11.792 --> 06:13.417
Um, how's that working out?

06:13.500 --> 06:15.417
Seven percent improvement
on recidivism rates

06:15.500 --> 06:17.792
compared to the state
for half of what they
spend.

06:17.875 --> 06:19.959
Minimal oversight too, right?

06:20.041 --> 06:22.291
Regulation never
kept
a kid out of jail.

06:22.375 --> 06:26.291
And the state rewards us with
more cutbacks and more kids.

06:26.375 --> 06:27.500
We can't turn them away.

06:27.583 --> 06:28.750
We're trying to help.

06:28.834 --> 06:30.417
Well, how about Alex Caceres?

06:30.500 --> 06:31.834
You able to help him?

06:31.917 --> 06:33.667
Alex Caceres.

06:33.750 --> 06:35.208
Yeah, that was
a
terrible
accident.

06:35.291 --> 06:36.500
We're looking into that.

06:37.709 --> 06:39.291
What do you mean?

06:39.375 --> 06:41.458
I mean, he slipped in his
room,
trying to open a window.

06:41.542 --> 06:42.834
AC was on the fritz.

06:42.917 --> 06:44.291
The cops never got a look
at the body

06:44.375 --> 06:46.208
'cause you moved it
before they got here.

06:46.291 --> 06:47.834
It wasn't a body to me.

06:47.917 --> 06:49.125
We moved him to the infirmary

06:49.208 --> 06:50.625
trying to save his life.

06:50.709 --> 06:53.000
Who has access
to the rooms at
night?

06:53.083 --> 06:54.542
Just the counselors.

06:54.625 --> 06:56.041
Counselors, that like a guard?

06:56.125 --> 06:58.959
Um, guard sends
the wrong message.

06:59.041 --> 07:00.834
Counselor is much better.

07:00.917 --> 07:03.375
Laticia Myers
oversaw Alex's dorm.

07:03.458 --> 07:05.208
She still works here.

07:05.291 --> 07:06.917
(Valens)
'You ever use restraints
on the kids?'

07:07.000 --> 07:08.834
(male #2)
'Oh, never on a kid like
Alex.'

07:08.917 --> 07:10.083
He was pretty well-behaved.

07:10.166 --> 07:11.333
Any other kids have a problem

07:11.417 --> 07:12.875
with him or..

07:12.959 --> 07:14.834
(male #2)
I wish I could tell you
more.

07:14.917 --> 07:16.458
Alex wasn't here for very long.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.166
This happened five years ago.

07:19.250 --> 07:21.500
- Why are you guys here now?
- New information.

07:21.583 --> 07:24.792
We'll need a list of all staff
and teachers from 2004.

07:24.875 --> 07:28.291
Employment records,
security logs, time cards.

07:28.375 --> 07:29.875
Whatever you need.

07:29.959 --> 07:32.875
Only a matter of time before
something like that happened.

07:32.959 --> 07:35.041
Well, your boss says
the place runs
smooth.

07:35.125 --> 07:37.000
You got the song
and dance from Mr. Price?

07:37.083 --> 07:39.625
- All the Kumbaya crap?
- It ain't true?

07:39.709 --> 07:41.834
Place is
understaffed,
over capacity.

07:41.917 --> 07:44.542
Add kids who've never
had adult supervision.

07:44.625 --> 07:46.333
You do that math.

07:46.417 --> 07:48.542
A lot of pressure
on you counselors.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.208
Keep your hands
to yourself, Alberto.

07:50.291 --> 07:51.834
I mean now.

07:54.583 --> 07:55.709
I came up Third and Diamond.

07:55.792 --> 07:57.458
I'm used to boys like this.

07:57.542 --> 07:59.166
Alex was killed in his room.

07:59.250 --> 08:00.875
It possible another kid
could have done it?

08:00.959 --> 08:03.625
Place like this,
doesn't take much to set it
off.

08:06.208 --> 08:09.041
(Laticia)
Lights out is 9:45.

08:09.125 --> 08:12.083
I catch you out of bed,
it's detention.

08:12.166 --> 08:15.208
Catch you in the common room,
it's detention.

08:15.291 --> 08:18.041
I catch you in the bathroom..

08:18.125 --> 08:19.917
...it's detention.

08:20.000 --> 08:21.333
You don't mess with me.

08:21.417 --> 08:22.834
'I don't mess with you.'

08:22.917 --> 08:25.750
You do, I take you down.

08:38.959 --> 08:41.250
[pounding on door]
Open the door right
now!

08:46.542 --> 08:48.917
Give me the keys.
Give me this backpack,
man.

08:52.000 --> 08:53.917
[laughs]
Look what we got here.

08:54.000 --> 08:55.709
Give it back!

08:55.792 --> 08:57.458
Oh, you wanted
that?
My bad, man.

08:57.542 --> 08:58.875
I didn't even know.

08:58.959 --> 09:00.333
Belongs to him, King Kong.

09:00.417 --> 09:02.250
What you call me?
You call me a monkey, homes?

09:02.333 --> 09:03.583
You sure smell like one, bro.

09:03.667 --> 09:05.000
I'm gonna knock
your little
smart-ass

09:05.083 --> 09:07.000
Puerto Rican head in
half.
How about that?

09:10.208 --> 09:11.458
(Mr. Price)
'Ray-Ray!'

09:11.542 --> 09:12.667
Get up! Get up right now!

09:12.750 --> 09:14.000
- Man, get off of me, man.
- Stop!

09:14.083 --> 09:15.125
Come on, Alex.

09:15.208 --> 09:16.834
It's over, boys. It's over.

09:19.041 --> 09:20.792
We're gonna talk this out.

09:25.583 --> 09:26.917
Evan had a conference with them.

09:27.000 --> 09:28.291
Made them shake hands.

09:28.375 --> 09:29.792
Sent them back in
time
for lunch.

09:29.875 --> 09:32.417
Now, this Ray-Ray,
type to hold a grudge?

09:32.500 --> 09:34.875
Miracle Alex lasted
as long as he did.

09:41.375 --> 09:43.500
Ray-Ray, big, bad stick-up boy

09:43.583 --> 09:46.792
on parole after
serving a deuce upstate.

09:46.875 --> 09:48.583
Yet you got a library card?

09:50.000 --> 09:52.083
Alright,
alright.
Be a gentleman.

09:53.041 --> 09:55.000
Mmm.

09:55.083 --> 09:56.542
Darleen..

09:56.625 --> 09:57.917
Lydia..

09:58.000 --> 09:59.083
Marissa.

09:59.166 --> 10:01.792
Just breaking hearts
all over South Philly.

10:01.875 --> 10:03.333
What you doing, man?

10:03.417 --> 10:05.834
- 'Tell us about Alex
Caceres.'
- Who?

10:05.917 --> 10:09.333
Played you in front of your
boys
day he got to Havenhurst.

10:09.417 --> 10:10.750
'Lived in the same dorm.'

10:10.834 --> 10:12.792
Till he woke up dead
in his room one morning.

10:12.875 --> 10:14.750
I don't know nothin' about that.

10:14.834 --> 10:16.375
(Miller)
'Adios,

10:17.709 --> 10:19.500
[sighs]
'Lydia.'

10:19.583 --> 10:20.792
Ooh, Marissa.

10:20.875 --> 10:22.500
Marissa? No.
C-c-can you leave that
one?

10:22.583 --> 10:25.041
Look, man, I ain't got
nothin' to hide, man.

10:25.125 --> 10:26.917
Alright? Me and Alex
was tight, for reals.

10:34.875 --> 10:37.166
(Ray-Ray)
Hey, man, I'm outside waiting
on my ride, right?

10:37.250 --> 10:40.417
Cops roll up before I can
even empty my pockets, dog.

10:40.500 --> 10:41.667
Got me on felony weight, man.

10:41.750 --> 10:44.083
Looking at some
serious time, man.

10:44.166 --> 10:45.250
Ain't you got a younger cousin?

10:45.333 --> 10:46.458
Say what?

10:46.542 --> 10:48.750
You get a little kid
to deliver your
product.

10:48.834 --> 10:50.917
They do what you tell
them
'cause they scared.

10:51.000 --> 10:54.125
And if they're caught,
they can't do serious time.

10:54.208 --> 10:55.709
Man, how do you know that?

10:55.792 --> 10:56.959
Lived it.

10:57.041 --> 10:59.125
Can't throw a punch,
but you're smart.

10:59.208 --> 11:01.667
Heard you was the one got open
the window in your room.

11:01.750 --> 11:03.208
Been trying out
for a month, man.

11:03.291 --> 11:05.542
I almost broke my hand
trying to work the hinge.

11:05.625 --> 11:07.166
Ain't about muscle.

11:09.500 --> 11:11.417
It's finesse.

11:11.500 --> 11:13.333
You stealing from me, boy?

11:13.417 --> 11:14.917
Sit your ass back down.

11:21.750 --> 11:23.667
Take from me again..

11:23.750 --> 11:25.792
...I'll pull your arm
right out of the socket.

11:30.792 --> 11:32.417
The look in Jimmy's eyes.

11:33.834 --> 11:35.875
We all knew he'd been upstate.

11:35.959 --> 11:37.834
This Jimmy get rough
with the kids?

11:37.917 --> 11:39.792
Look, man,
that place was a joke to
me.

11:40.959 --> 11:43.417
Except Jimmy.
Him, I-I took
serious.

11:44.583 --> 11:46.875
Oh, sorry, dad.
I got caught up.

11:47.834 --> 11:49.375
No, no. Tomorrow works.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.125
Same time. Bye.

11:53.667 --> 11:56.041
Oh, no, you didn't have
to cancel your plans.

11:56.125 --> 11:57.709
Partners, right?

11:57.792 --> 11:58.792
Share the load?

11:59.834 --> 12:01.291
Well, the files are a mess.

12:01.375 --> 12:04.417
Employment records mixed
with offender intake forms.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.125
I mean, nothing's where
it's supposed to be.

12:06.208 --> 12:09.083
Well, I did find this,
criminal
record for our shop teacher.

12:09.166 --> 12:10.625
Jimmy Clarke.

12:10.709 --> 12:13.500
'Picked up his prison stare
in New Jersey State Pen.'

12:13.583 --> 12:14.709
Seven years for ag assault.

12:14.792 --> 12:15.959
Nearly killed a guy

12:16.041 --> 12:17.709
with the butt of his gun.

12:19.041 --> 12:20.500
How's an ex-con like this

12:20.583 --> 12:22.500
get hired to teach
at Havenhurst?

12:22.583 --> 12:24.500
Well, not a long
line
of applicants.

12:24.583 --> 12:27.208
No pay, no benefits,
no background check.

12:27.291 --> 12:28.917
No problem.

12:29.000 --> 12:30.125
Yeah.

12:39.500 --> 12:41.333
It's a gold Mercury Sable

12:41.417 --> 12:44.500
registered
to a Maurice Kitchener.

12:44.583 --> 12:46.750
Whatever you need,
I'll back you up.

12:58.917 --> 13:00.709
Deputy Commissioner Doherty.

13:00.792 --> 13:02.041
Trying to introduce myself

13:02.125 --> 13:04.166
to all the detectives
under my command.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.166
Miller, right?
Used to work Narcotics?

13:06.250 --> 13:07.333
That's right.

13:07.417 --> 13:08.834
You the one who opened
this Alex Caceres

13:08.917 --> 13:10.583
can of worms?

13:10.667 --> 13:12.000
That would be me, Pat.

13:19.750 --> 13:21.709
Just can't help yourself, John.

13:21.792 --> 13:23.917
Gotta find new ways
to piss me off?

13:24.000 --> 13:25.834
Keeps me busy
during the slow times.

13:25.917 --> 13:27.542
Wanna tell me why the hell
we're investigating

13:27.625 --> 13:28.750
an accidental death?

13:28.834 --> 13:30.542
What's it matter to you
what cases we take?

13:30.625 --> 13:32.959
We need closed cases,
not whodunits.

13:33.041 --> 13:34.375
You let me worry
about closing them.

13:34.458 --> 13:35.792
You can always take the credit.

13:35.875 --> 13:38.792
I oversee the Detective Bureau
now, John.

13:38.875 --> 13:40.333
You're gonna have to
get used to it.

13:40.417 --> 13:43.625
You're shutting this
investigation down
immediately.

13:43.709 --> 13:44.959
'We clear?'

13:46.792 --> 13:48.375
I need to hear you say it, John.

13:50.291 --> 13:51.458
We're clear.

14:06.792 --> 14:09.500
Whatever you need on the
Alex Caceres job, you got
it.

14:14.583 --> 14:16.875
Got anger management
issues, Jimmy?

14:16.959 --> 14:18.083
Meanin'?

14:18.166 --> 14:19.375
You beat a guy to a bloody pulp

14:19.458 --> 14:21.250
in a parking lot
in Atlantic City.

14:21.333 --> 14:22.750
Guy owed me money.

14:22.834 --> 14:24.667
Wanna pay me back
with a crowbar.

14:24.750 --> 14:26.542
'I was protecting myself.'

14:26.625 --> 14:28.083
I did my time for it too.

14:28.166 --> 14:30.750
Why take a job
at a place like
Havenhurst?

14:30.834 --> 14:32.750
When I went upstate,
I learned carpentry.

14:32.834 --> 14:34.208
'Figured that was something'

14:34.291 --> 14:35.625
'I could give back
to these kids.'

14:35.709 --> 14:36.625
A way out.

14:36.709 --> 14:39.291
Well, an ex-con altruist.

14:39.375 --> 14:41.625
(Jimmy)
'Teaching street kids
they could use'

14:41.709 --> 14:43.333
their hands to build.

14:43.417 --> 14:44.875
'Give 'em pride.'

14:44.959 --> 14:46.500
Call it what you want.

14:46.583 --> 14:48.125
(Miller)
'What about trouble kids?'

14:48.208 --> 14:49.625
Alex Caceres..

14:49.709 --> 14:50.667
'...for instance.'

14:50.750 --> 14:51.709
This is about Alex?

14:51.792 --> 14:53.750
Well, he stole from you, right?

14:53.834 --> 14:55.125
Like that guy in AC.

14:55.208 --> 14:58.208
Nah, he just made a
mistake.
We-we were cool.

14:58.291 --> 15:00.125
(Jeffries)
'You don't seem surprised
to hear his name'

15:00.208 --> 15:02.125
come from a homicide detective.

15:02.208 --> 15:04.166
Never believed
it was an accident.

15:04.250 --> 15:05.750
Could have spoken up
back in the day.

15:05.834 --> 15:10.125
[laughing]
Yeah, me and cops
don't get along too good.

15:10.208 --> 15:12.083
You have access
to the dorms at Havenhurst?

15:12.166 --> 15:15.709
Rules were clear. I was only
allowed in the classroom area.

15:15.792 --> 15:17.583
Where were you
the night Alex died?

15:17.667 --> 15:19.458
Working nights
in a hardware store

15:19.542 --> 15:22.083
so I could afford supplies
for my shop class.

15:23.375 --> 15:25.458
I was the only one
looking out for that kid.

15:26.875 --> 15:28.917
Did a pretty lousy
job
of it, Jimmy.

15:30.250 --> 15:31.542
Don't think I know that?

15:34.709 --> 15:36.125
Eats me up every day.

15:47.750 --> 15:50.834
- Got any with nuts?
- Two dollars.

15:50.917 --> 15:52.166
Yeah, not today, my man.

15:52.250 --> 15:53.500
I can get other stuff too.

15:53.583 --> 15:54.625
Anything you want.

15:54.709 --> 15:56.375
Just name it.

15:56.458 --> 15:58.750
Acclimating yourself
like a pro, huh?

15:58.834 --> 16:01.709
'Gaming the system
prepares you for one thing'

16:01.792 --> 16:04.041
becoming a repeat offender.

16:04.125 --> 16:05.583
'You a smart kid.'

16:05.667 --> 16:07.625
You need to put your mind
to something constructive.

16:07.709 --> 16:10.000
Like what?
Building
birdhouses?

16:10.083 --> 16:11.709
Do the time,
or the time does you.

16:11.792 --> 16:13.208
Gonna tell me
to work the
system?

16:13.291 --> 16:15.208
'Cause all the
system
done for me

16:15.291 --> 16:17.375
is take my family..

16:17.458 --> 16:19.375
...stick me
in places like
this.

16:21.750 --> 16:23.291
That's a raw deal, my man.

16:24.375 --> 16:25.792
For real.

16:25.875 --> 16:27.875
'But you can't keep it
bottled in.'

16:27.959 --> 16:29.875
'It festers in there.'

16:29.959 --> 16:31.041
Trust me, I know.

16:33.291 --> 16:34.542
Old picture.

16:36.792 --> 16:38.291
Guess you don't see him
much anymore.

16:40.166 --> 16:42.041
Don't say another word
about him.

16:44.709 --> 16:46.083
Didn't mean nothing.

16:48.333 --> 16:49.667
Let's keep it on you.

16:51.125 --> 16:53.875
Why you got blood
on your shirt, hmm?

16:55.208 --> 16:56.709
'Come on, Alex.'

16:56.792 --> 16:59.083
Either you're getting beat,
or you're doin' the beatin'.

16:59.166 --> 17:00.417
I got to go.

17:07.834 --> 17:09.583
Figured he was getting bullied.

17:11.166 --> 17:13.583
Tried a couple more times
to get through to him.

17:15.041 --> 17:16.333
He wouldn't talk.

17:16.417 --> 17:17.458
Give up after that?

17:17.542 --> 17:18.750
(Jimmy)
'Of course not.'

17:20.333 --> 17:23.000
I called the only person
who might have actually
helped.

17:24.583 --> 17:26.458
His lawyer.

17:26.542 --> 17:27.875
(female #1)
'What do you want me to say?'

17:27.959 --> 17:29.750
A lot of kids I
used
to work with got
hurt.

17:31.125 --> 17:33.750
Many of them reach out
to you like Alex
Caceres

17:33.834 --> 17:35.041
days before they died?

17:35.125 --> 17:37.125
I don't know
what you're talking about.

17:37.208 --> 17:38.625
(Rush)
'Well, his shop teacher,
Jimmy Clarke'

17:38.709 --> 17:40.959
called you, told you
Alex was in trouble.

17:41.041 --> 17:43.417
We need to take you into
interrogation? Jog your memory?

17:43.500 --> 17:46.083
We have records
show you visited
Alex

17:46.166 --> 17:47.959
at Havenhurst
the week he
died.

17:54.333 --> 17:56.417
I got out of this racket
for a reason.

17:58.041 --> 18:00.625
So damn tragic all the time.

18:00.709 --> 18:03.250
Jimmy said
Alex had blood on his shirt.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.792
What was going on with him?

18:04.875 --> 18:06.166
Not what you think.

18:10.083 --> 18:12.083
Jimmy thinks
you're in
trouble.

18:12.166 --> 18:13.542
And he wouldn't go
through the hassle

18:13.625 --> 18:15.417
of calling me
unless
he thinks it's
serious.

18:20.583 --> 18:23.583
Alex, if the older boys
are bothering you

18:23.667 --> 18:25.750
we need to address that.

18:25.834 --> 18:27.583
Have a conference.

18:27.667 --> 18:29.041
Ain't no snitch.

18:29.125 --> 18:31.917
It's not really snitchin'
if it's happening to you.

18:37.709 --> 18:39.959
Why don't I get myself
a cup of coffee?

18:43.750 --> 18:46.291
If someone's hurting
you,
you gotta speak up.

18:46.375 --> 18:48.875
Could be grounds
to get you out.

18:48.959 --> 18:50.750
Not me.

18:50.834 --> 18:51.875
Someone else.

18:51.959 --> 18:53.333
He's young like a runt.

18:53.417 --> 18:55.250
Getting beat every night.

18:55.333 --> 18:57.500
Well, then he needs
to call his own
lawyer.

18:57.583 --> 18:59.375
His lawyer won't
return his calls.

19:00.542 --> 19:01.959
He won't survive much longer.

19:02.041 --> 19:04.166
- Said you're here to help.
- I'm here to help you.

19:04.250 --> 19:05.709
Then get him out of here.

19:05.792 --> 19:07.333
He's 11.

19:07.417 --> 19:10.542
Lifted some comics,
got six months.

19:10.625 --> 19:11.875
That sound right to you?

19:14.000 --> 19:15.542
Give me his name,
I'll look into it

19:15.625 --> 19:17.125
'but no promises.'

19:19.959 --> 19:21.792
Michael.

19:21.875 --> 19:24.291
Michael Rodgers.
You'll like him.

19:24.375 --> 19:26.417
'I'll call his lawyer,
get into it.'

19:29.625 --> 19:32.250
Hey, uh, what's
this mean, "Juris.."

19:32.333 --> 19:34.000
"Jurisprudence?"

19:34.083 --> 19:35.583
It's the legal system.

19:35.667 --> 19:37.667
It ensures we get justice.

19:37.750 --> 19:39.709
'We all abide by it.'

19:39.792 --> 19:41.083
It's how I'm gonna help you.

19:46.625 --> 19:48.583
I found Michael Rodgers' lawyer

19:48.667 --> 19:50.041
told him Michael
was having
trouble

19:50.125 --> 19:52.208
made sure he petitioned
to have him transferred.

19:52.291 --> 19:54.542
So, that's it?

19:54.625 --> 19:56.166
I was overwhelmed
with my own clients.

19:56.250 --> 19:57.250
What was I supposed to do?

19:57.333 --> 19:58.458
Oh, maybe speak up

19:58.542 --> 20:00.333
when Alex died
three weeks later?

20:00.417 --> 20:02.542
Well, I didn't see you
there either, Valens.

20:02.625 --> 20:04.083
- Yeah.
- Or were you late again?

20:04.166 --> 20:05.625
Hey, I reached out to Alex.

20:05.709 --> 20:07.542
Told him whatever he needed,
I'd be there.

20:07.625 --> 20:10.291
[scoffs]
But he pushed you away,
right?

20:10.375 --> 20:11.917
Ever wonder why?

20:12.000 --> 20:13.917
Or does self-doubt
cramp
your style?

20:22.041 --> 20:24.250
Still on hold?

20:24.333 --> 20:26.291
Yeah, trying to get
Michael out of JDC.

20:26.375 --> 20:29.291
Court hasn't responded
to my request to move him,
so..

20:29.375 --> 20:31.333
'I spoke to his lawyer
from back then.'

20:31.417 --> 20:34.500
Petition to transfer Michael
from Havenhurst was denied.

20:34.583 --> 20:36.792
Gotta love the juvenile
justice system.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.709
'But the weird thing is,
his lawyer says'

20:38.792 --> 20:41.750
Michael was transferred
a few days after Alex died.

20:41.834 --> 20:43.083
Never knew why.

20:45.333 --> 20:47.375
Well, maybe Michael
could fill in the
blanks

20:47.458 --> 20:49.041
if I can get ahold of him.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.500
You know what that lawyer said?

20:52.583 --> 20:54.250
'Marci?'

20:54.333 --> 20:57.166
"Hey, can't be everywhere
at once."

20:57.250 --> 20:58.291
Should have been there though.

20:58.375 --> 21:01.333
The system let him down,
not you.

21:01.417 --> 21:03.667
All due respect, Lil..

21:04.875 --> 21:06.041
...it was me.

21:08.291 --> 21:10.834
Look, you know,
go to your
dinner.

21:10.917 --> 21:12.250
I got this covered.

21:15.250 --> 21:16.542
Yeah.

21:16.625 --> 21:18.333
Yeah, I'm still here.

21:20.500 --> 21:23.834
Wait. What-what do you mean,
he was processed?

21:26.500 --> 21:28.959
Hey, Michael's coming with me.

21:29.041 --> 21:30.709
(male #3)
'I can't let you
do that, detective.'

21:30.792 --> 21:32.834
Oh, he's a key witness
in a homicide investigation.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.333
You don't like it..

21:34.417 --> 21:35.500
...call the cops.

21:36.458 --> 21:39.417
Hey, um, yeah, bad news.

21:39.500 --> 21:41.375
I-I got to work late again.

21:42.458 --> 21:44.417
No. No, I'm fine, dad.

21:44.500 --> 21:45.792
[laughs]
Okay.

21:45.875 --> 21:48.208
Alright, we'll do it
another time.

21:48.291 --> 21:49.500
You, too.

22:12.625 --> 22:15.000
Hi, it's Detective Rush
from Homicide.

22:15.083 --> 22:16.667
Yeah, I'm gonna
need help, um

22:16.750 --> 22:17.959
tracking a cell.

22:51.542 --> 22:54.125
Lilly, one more step and
I'd have blown your head off.

22:54.208 --> 22:56.083
Well, nice to see you too,
Saccardo.

23:03.792 --> 23:05.083
You got nothin' to eat?

23:06.458 --> 23:08.291
I'm in deep.

23:08.375 --> 23:09.750
Don't usually entertain.

23:12.083 --> 23:13.458
Well, I think for a stalker

23:13.542 --> 23:15.417
you could at least offer me
something to drink.

23:15.500 --> 23:18.750
Well, it took you long enough
to trace those photos.

23:18.834 --> 23:20.083
Well..

23:21.709 --> 23:23.208
...I'm a cop..

23:23.291 --> 23:24.542
...in my spare time.

23:27.625 --> 23:28.959
I guess you missed me.

23:30.000 --> 23:31.125
Not really.

23:35.041 --> 23:36.959
But when I heard they let..

23:37.041 --> 23:40.000
...major scumbag walk on bail..

23:40.083 --> 23:43.166
I know, I don't
really need you
to--

23:43.250 --> 23:45.000
Watch out for you?

23:45.083 --> 23:46.375
I just wanna make sure
I got something to look

23:46.458 --> 23:47.959
forward to when I surface.

23:54.375 --> 23:56.333
We really gotta
stop
meeting like this.

24:03.875 --> 24:05.166
Where is he now?

24:05.250 --> 24:07.875
Probably trying to get
the boot off his car.

24:07.959 --> 24:09.333
Does that make you
feel better?

24:10.875 --> 24:13.000
- It's a Band-Aid.
- So what're you gonna do?

24:13.083 --> 24:14.291
What would you do?

24:15.375 --> 24:16.667
Situation like mine.

24:18.041 --> 24:19.375
A guy like this?

24:20.959 --> 24:22.333
We'll figure something out.

24:25.208 --> 24:26.542
Seriously though..

24:27.625 --> 24:29.208
...I'm starving.

24:29.291 --> 24:30.583
Well, let's go
get some eggs.

24:31.959 --> 24:33.291
(female #2)
'Here you go, boys.'

24:35.291 --> 24:36.458
I said I wanted a burger.

24:36.542 --> 24:38.166
It's breakfast.

24:38.250 --> 24:39.542
- What's it gonna cost me?
- I told you.

24:39.625 --> 24:41.500
I wouldn't let them
take you back to Havenhurst.

24:41.583 --> 24:43.542
Kept my word, right?
Do me a favor.

24:43.625 --> 24:44.750
Eat the eggs.

24:50.625 --> 24:53.041
After Alex died,
you got transferred out.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.542
How did that happen?

24:54.625 --> 24:55.750
See, you hustling
me
this whole time.

24:55.834 --> 24:57.375
You contacted me, remember?

24:57.458 --> 24:59.375
I'm seeing it through.
You gotta trust me.

24:59.458 --> 25:01.500
- Alex trusted you.
- Yeah, you're right.

25:01.583 --> 25:02.917
And I let him down.

25:04.709 --> 25:07.875
Alex...deserved better.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.125
Night Alex died..

25:15.208 --> 25:16.959
...he swore he was gonna
get me out of Havenhurst.

25:18.667 --> 25:21.667
- He was trying to save me.
- Save you, from what?

25:21.750 --> 25:23.583
They took me out of my
room
after lights out.

25:26.375 --> 25:27.750
I thought
they was gonna kill
me.

25:27.834 --> 25:30.250
Alright, give me
the names of the kids.

25:30.333 --> 25:32.083
Wasn't the kids
I was afraid of.

25:38.291 --> 25:40.083
Hey!

25:40.166 --> 25:42.875
- Get off! Now!
- Back to your room, Alex.

25:42.959 --> 25:44.875
- Ain't none of your concern.
- 'I'm looking out for him.'

25:44.959 --> 25:47.208
- Supposed to be your job.
- My job is keeping you in
line.

25:47.291 --> 25:49.208
- Little punk's a thief.
- This about your damn keys?

25:49.291 --> 25:51.375
It's about something he took
from the director's office.

25:51.458 --> 25:52.625
'A very expensive pen.'

25:52.709 --> 25:54.125
I-I didn't do it, Alex.
I swear.

25:54.208 --> 25:57.542
Gold, fancy, says
jurisprudence
on it. I took it.

25:57.625 --> 25:58.750
Get him down to the infirmary.

25:58.834 --> 26:00.417
I wanna stay with you.

26:00.500 --> 26:01.667
Get him out of here.

26:01.750 --> 26:03.125
You're gonna give me
that pen, Alex.

26:03.208 --> 26:04.709
Or what, Miss Myers?

26:04.792 --> 26:05.834
'Cause I'm done giving in.

26:05.917 --> 26:07.125
We'll see about that.

26:11.375 --> 26:13.250
Laticia made every
day
hell for me.

26:15.208 --> 26:16.625
Then she turned on Alex.

26:16.709 --> 26:18.458
Think she hurt Alex?

26:18.542 --> 26:20.667
Alex gone, ain't he?

26:20.750 --> 26:22.125
Laticia's still there.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.333
Still don't know why
he stood up for me like
that.

26:28.750 --> 26:31.959
Well, maybe he was doin'
for you what..

26:32.041 --> 26:33.500
...no one ever did for him.

26:38.709 --> 26:40.333
Thanks, Detective Valens.

26:40.417 --> 26:41.709
Yeah, what for?

26:44.417 --> 26:45.583
The eggs.

26:49.542 --> 26:51.375
I just got off
the phone with
JDC.

26:51.458 --> 26:52.667
'One of your detectives
kidnapped'

26:52.750 --> 26:54.166
a juvenile
offender
last night.

26:54.250 --> 26:55.458
Is that so?

26:55.542 --> 26:57.000
This ends now.

26:57.083 --> 27:00.583
You're ordering me to back off
an open homicide investigation.

27:02.333 --> 27:03.959
Maybe you're unaware
since you've never worked

27:04.041 --> 27:05.667
an active squad in your life

27:05.750 --> 27:08.625
but deputy commissioners don't
get personally involved in
cases

27:08.709 --> 27:10.208
unless there's something
to hide.

27:15.834 --> 27:17.500
Budget cuts are a bitch, huh?

27:19.792 --> 27:21.583
Manpower shortages everywhere.

27:23.959 --> 27:26.834
Except here,
John,
in Homicide.

27:28.417 --> 27:30.083
There's an opening
on the midnight
shift

27:30.166 --> 27:32.417
East Detectives.

27:32.500 --> 27:35.000
Gonna need you to
sacrifice
one of your guys.

27:35.083 --> 27:36.667
Not gonna happen.

27:36.750 --> 27:37.959
You pick..

27:39.083 --> 27:40.250
...or I will.

27:42.125 --> 27:44.375
I gotta tell ya,
Havenhurst employment records

27:44.458 --> 27:45.667
are a mess.

27:45.750 --> 27:48.000
'Took us days
to find your file.'

27:48.083 --> 27:49.417
Sure glad we did.

27:49.500 --> 27:51.667
Looks like you applied
to the police academy

27:51.750 --> 27:53.542
same time you applied
at Havenhurst.

27:54.792 --> 27:56.041
Wanna wear a badge?

27:56.125 --> 27:58.208
- Carry a gun?
- I was lookin' to serve.

27:58.291 --> 28:00.625
'Cause you're from Third
and Diamond, right?

28:00.709 --> 28:02.917
- Tough street.
- Whole neighborhood's tough.

28:03.000 --> 28:06.417
Said you grew up with boys
like the ones at Havenhurst.

28:06.500 --> 28:08.750
Did you mean
the Hernandez brothers?

28:11.041 --> 28:12.834
I mean, every cop
in the 26th has arrested

28:12.917 --> 28:15.417
one of those dirtbags
at some time or another.

28:15.500 --> 28:17.750
You look back far enough
in their records

28:17.834 --> 28:19.542
your name comes up
as a complainant.

28:19.625 --> 28:22.625
- So?
- They attacked you, Laticia.

28:22.709 --> 28:23.959
'They dragged you
into their house.'

28:24.041 --> 28:25.875
'Kept you there for hours.'

28:25.959 --> 28:28.458
- You were 12.
- I survived.

28:28.542 --> 28:30.250
That must have affected you.

28:30.333 --> 28:31.625
Being trapped.

28:31.709 --> 28:33.458
'Surrounded by those animals.'

28:33.542 --> 28:36.125
And that's why
you wanted to be a cop.

28:36.208 --> 28:37.625
But you got turned down.

28:39.041 --> 28:40.458
Said I was unfit.

28:40.542 --> 28:42.208
'For psychological reasons.'

28:44.291 --> 28:47.458
That didn't seem to be
an issue at Havenhurst.

28:47.542 --> 28:49.750
Where you pitted
those boys against each other.

28:49.834 --> 28:51.166
I didn't have a
problem
with Alex.

28:51.250 --> 28:53.542
It was Michael
who pissed you off.

28:53.625 --> 28:55.709
But Alex stood up to you
the night he died.

28:55.792 --> 28:58.166
I told him to go
back
to his room.

28:58.250 --> 29:00.083
He cornered me,
you understand?

29:00.166 --> 29:01.834
You weren't a counselor anymore.

29:01.917 --> 29:04.625
You were that little girl
from Third and Diamond.

29:04.709 --> 29:06.375
He wouldn't back down.

29:08.041 --> 29:09.792
- Back off, Alex.
- Or what?

29:09.875 --> 29:11.792
- Don't got your posse now.
- I'm warnin' you.

29:11.875 --> 29:14.291
Nothing you could do to
me
ain't already been done.

29:14.375 --> 29:15.291
You hear me?

29:15.375 --> 29:16.667
Got one more chance.

29:16.750 --> 29:19.750
You're not gonna hurt
Michael
ever again.

29:23.750 --> 29:25.083
- What the hell you doing?
- She hurt those kids.

29:25.166 --> 29:26.500
- Beatin' Michael.
- 'I don't care.'

29:26.583 --> 29:28.125
You don't put hands
on the staff, Alex.

29:28.208 --> 29:29.333
Screw you.

29:29.417 --> 29:31.250
Pretend to be one of us,
you're as bad as her.

29:31.333 --> 29:32.375
You going back
to your room.

29:32.458 --> 29:33.750
Man, you ain't my dad.

29:33.834 --> 29:35.917
Can't even take care
of your own kid.

29:40.709 --> 29:43.792
Should have seen Jimmy dragging
Alex back to his room.

29:46.083 --> 29:47.750
Last time I saw the kid alive.

29:49.250 --> 29:51.375
I thought Jimmy wasn't
authorized to be in the dorm.

29:51.458 --> 29:53.291
He did handyman work
off the books.

29:53.375 --> 29:55.000
Got him a key.

29:55.083 --> 29:56.375
And didn't report
any of this?

29:56.458 --> 29:58.291
Would have thanked him
if I had the chance.

29:58.375 --> 30:00.625
What do you mean?
Where did he go?

30:00.709 --> 30:02.875
Disappeared after that night.

30:02.959 --> 30:04.750
Out sick for a week.

30:04.834 --> 30:05.875
There's no record of that.

30:05.959 --> 30:06.959
Told you.

30:07.041 --> 30:08.625
Those kids were animals.

30:08.709 --> 30:10.417
Jimmy knew it.

30:10.500 --> 30:11.834
Did us all a favor.

30:13.375 --> 30:15.792
I think it's time
for a new profession, Laticia.

30:20.834 --> 30:22.750
You disappointed me, Jimmy.

30:22.834 --> 30:24.083
The way you were talking
the other day

30:24.166 --> 30:25.875
I started to believe.

30:25.959 --> 30:28.917
Teaching those boys
self-respect
through carpentry.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.542
Just like Jesus.

30:30.625 --> 30:33.208
(Miller)
'Here's a fun fact
from your past.'

30:33.291 --> 30:35.542
Night you beat
that guy in AC

30:35.625 --> 30:37.542
your three-year-old son
was in the car.

30:37.625 --> 30:39.750
(Jeffries)
'Cops pull you over,
he's in the back.'

30:39.834 --> 30:41.542
They take your kid,
put him in the
system.

30:41.625 --> 30:44.500
(Miller)
'Get out of lockup,
go straight to Havenhurst.'

30:44.583 --> 30:46.041
I'm just trying to make amends.

30:46.125 --> 30:48.959
(Jeffries)
'Be a positive influence
on all kinda kids.'

30:49.041 --> 30:50.750
As long as it wasn't your own.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.917
When was the last time
you saw your kid, Jimmy?

30:54.000 --> 30:55.875
You don't know nothing about it.

30:55.959 --> 30:58.417
(Jeffries)
Record keeping at Havenhurst
is a mess.

30:58.500 --> 31:00.250
Couldn't find your timecards.

31:00.333 --> 31:02.458
But your old boss
at the hardware store

31:02.542 --> 31:04.458
keeps everything.

31:04.542 --> 31:06.875
You were late
the night Alex died.

31:06.959 --> 31:09.083
(Miller)
'Got an eyeball witness
ready to testify'

31:09.166 --> 31:10.375
'you got violent with him.'

31:10.458 --> 31:12.917
Puts you in his room
the night he was killed.

31:13.000 --> 31:15.375
I know what Laticia think.

31:15.458 --> 31:18.291
But I was trying to keep Alex
from flushing his future away.

31:19.625 --> 31:21.250
He was way ahead of me though.

31:23.917 --> 31:25.583
Oh, you a damn fool.

31:25.667 --> 31:27.291
Attacking counselors?

31:27.375 --> 31:29.500
That's a one-way
ticket upstate.

31:29.583 --> 31:31.458
I'm the only one
willing to fight.

31:31.542 --> 31:33.417
A fight you'll lose.

31:35.208 --> 31:36.500
You afraid of them,
ain't you?

31:37.792 --> 31:40.333
I'm not saying don't push.

31:40.417 --> 31:42.500
I'm saying you gotta
handle it different.

31:42.583 --> 31:44.750
Educate me, my man.

31:44.834 --> 31:48.667
You're playing the game
with every disadvantage.

31:48.750 --> 31:50.000
They outman you!

31:50.083 --> 31:51.500
They outgun you!

31:51.583 --> 31:54.333
You got one weapon.
You hear? One!

31:54.417 --> 31:56.542
'Your mind.'

32:03.625 --> 32:05.750
It's like what you said
about the..

32:05.834 --> 32:07.458
...the window to Ray-Ray.

32:09.542 --> 32:10.875
You can't force it open.

32:13.125 --> 32:14.667
You gotta finesse it.

32:26.750 --> 32:28.375
'"Jurisprudence?"'

32:29.417 --> 32:30.542
What's that?

32:30.625 --> 32:32.250
System we all live under.

32:32.333 --> 32:34.000
And-and it's broken.
I get it now.

32:34.083 --> 32:35.875
That's why
they keep Michael here.

32:35.959 --> 32:38.000
'Nobody ever gets transferred
out, ever notice that?'

32:38.083 --> 32:40.500
Sick kids, psychos.
Nobody.

32:40.583 --> 32:43.166
Every bed is full.
Always.

32:43.250 --> 32:44.583
I don't know what
you're talking
about.

32:44.667 --> 32:46.041
I need you to do me a favor.

32:46.125 --> 32:47.834
Get this
to Detective Scotty Valens.

32:47.917 --> 32:48.917
A cop?

32:49.000 --> 32:50.375
Hey, whoa, whoa.
What's going on?

32:50.458 --> 32:52.041
Tell him to hold on to it,
please, Jimmy.

32:53.792 --> 32:55.000
Trust me?

32:56.500 --> 32:58.709
- Alright.
- Need one more favor.

32:59.959 --> 33:01.333
Let me use the phone.

33:07.291 --> 33:09.709
Main office was the only place
to make a call.

33:11.125 --> 33:13.583
I left the door open
for him on my way out.

33:13.667 --> 33:15.166
You know who
he was gonna
call?

33:15.250 --> 33:16.625
(Jimmy)
'I didn't ask.'

33:16.709 --> 33:19.083
He said he needed me
to trust him.

33:19.166 --> 33:21.041
I did.

33:21.125 --> 33:22.375
What about the pen?

33:23.667 --> 33:24.750
You do anything with it?

33:24.834 --> 33:26.166
Alex was dead.

33:27.166 --> 33:29.041
My prints was all over his room.

33:31.667 --> 33:34.291
Waited in my place for a week
for the cops to come.

33:36.375 --> 33:37.583
Never showed.

33:38.583 --> 33:40.208
You still got that pen, Jimmy?

33:45.000 --> 33:46.667
(Rush)
'I checked the Havenhurst
phone records'

33:46.750 --> 33:48.917
the night Alex died,
and a call was made

33:49.000 --> 33:52.709
at half past midnight
to the private residence
of..

33:52.792 --> 33:54.000
...Harold Alvarez.

33:54.083 --> 33:55.583
Uh, Judge Hang 'Em High Harry?

33:55.667 --> 33:57.417
Yeah, just told the
boss,
and he says

33:57.500 --> 34:00.041
the judge
and Deputy Commissioner Doherty

34:00.125 --> 34:01.417
are golf buddies.

34:02.750 --> 34:05.500
Explains why Doherty's been
breathing down our necks.

34:05.583 --> 34:07.583
He's protecting the judge.

34:07.667 --> 34:10.583
So why did Alex
need
to call the judge?

34:10.667 --> 34:13.792
I've been searching
the word, jurisprudence

34:13.875 --> 34:15.625
and I still can't figure out

34:15.709 --> 34:18.000
what Alex was saying to me
with this pen.

34:21.625 --> 34:23.208
We'll check out the judge too.

34:27.208 --> 34:30.083
Look, cross-checked the judge's
name with jurisprudence.

34:31.792 --> 34:33.375
'Look what comes up.'

34:38.583 --> 34:39.875
(Valens)
Hey,
judge.

34:41.041 --> 34:43.125
I found this at Havenhurst

34:43.208 --> 34:44.291
a little while ago.

34:44.375 --> 34:45.500
Figured you'd want it back.

34:45.583 --> 34:47.250
I've toured that facility
a few times.

34:47.333 --> 34:49.125
I must have left it there.
Thank you.

34:49.208 --> 34:50.709
"Jurisprudence."

34:50.792 --> 34:53.125
It means justice, right?

34:53.208 --> 34:56.208
But it's also a
luxury
ski cabin in Utah

34:56.291 --> 34:58.333
where you own it
with your
sister-in-law.

34:58.417 --> 34:59.583
If you don't mind,
I'm running late.

34:59.667 --> 35:01.417
Your
sister-in-law's
an entrepreneur.

35:01.500 --> 35:04.333
[chuckles]
I mean,
she owns nursing homes

35:04.417 --> 35:06.750
juvenile centers,
Havenhurst, for
one.

35:08.166 --> 35:10.667
So the state pays Havenhurst

35:10.750 --> 35:12.500
for every kid sent there.

35:12.583 --> 35:16.041
Havenhurst is owned by
your
sister-in-law. She pays
you--

35:16.125 --> 35:18.125
You will reconsider
what you're saying

35:18.208 --> 35:19.792
if that badge means anything
at all to you--

35:19.875 --> 35:21.333
It's incentive
for strict
sentencin'

35:21.417 --> 35:24.417
a reason to block
transfers,
like Michael Rodgers.

35:24.500 --> 35:27.000
Accusing me
of judicial misconduct?

35:27.083 --> 35:30.208
No, that's for the
Justice
Department to sort
out.

35:30.291 --> 35:32.291
I'm accusing you of murder.

35:32.375 --> 35:33.667
Alex Caceres.

35:34.959 --> 35:36.375
I didn't kill that boy.

35:36.458 --> 35:39.458
No, now you're the type of guy

35:39.542 --> 35:41.875
has other people do the deed.

35:41.959 --> 35:43.500
Give me a name.

35:43.583 --> 35:46.709
I got records that put
you and Alex on the
phone

35:46.792 --> 35:48.125
the night he died.

35:50.917 --> 35:53.208
I'll give you two minutes..

35:53.291 --> 35:55.750
...to tell me
who killed
Alex.

36:01.875 --> 36:04.875
The day of Alex's
hearin',
I was late.

36:04.959 --> 36:07.083
I should have been there, but..

36:07.166 --> 36:08.709
...it didn't matter, did it?

36:08.792 --> 36:10.041
I could have been early

36:10.125 --> 36:11.625
you still would
have sent Alex
away..

36:12.959 --> 36:15.250
...just to make a buck.

36:15.333 --> 36:16.917
You know what? Screw
it.
Turn around, judge.

36:17.000 --> 36:19.000
- I'm locking you up.
- Wait, wait, wait!

36:20.625 --> 36:23.792
The boy had my attention.

36:34.583 --> 36:35.625
Hello.

36:35.709 --> 36:37.375
(Alex)
'How do you sleep at night?'

36:38.583 --> 36:39.792
Who is this?

36:39.875 --> 36:41.417
'Sent me to Havenhurst
for a joyride'

36:41.500 --> 36:43.208
'with a lot of other kids
here for less.'

36:44.500 --> 36:47.250
Son, if you know
what's good for you

36:47.333 --> 36:49.417
you'll hang up this phone now.

36:49.500 --> 36:51.125
'I know what jurisprudence is.'

36:51.208 --> 36:53.125
'Even a delinquent can use
the internet.'

36:53.208 --> 36:56.125
'That's why you send us here,
for a fancy house?'

36:56.208 --> 36:59.792
Those are some
very serious accusations.

36:59.875 --> 37:02.583
'Get away with it
'cause everyone listens to
you.'

37:02.667 --> 37:03.875
'But not us.'

37:05.917 --> 37:07.208
What do you want from me, kid?

37:08.458 --> 37:10.834
'Get my friend,
Michael Rodgers'

37:10.917 --> 37:13.166
'transferred tonight'

37:13.250 --> 37:15.542
'or I'll call
the 11 o'clock news.'

37:15.625 --> 37:18.250
'I think they'll listen to
me,
don't you?'

37:18.333 --> 37:20.125
- 'What are you doing, Alex?'
- 'Hey, get off me.'

37:20.208 --> 37:22.041
- 'Give me the phone now.'
- 'No!'

37:24.917 --> 37:27.166
It was supposed
to be a good facility.

37:28.542 --> 37:29.875
Nobody should have gotten hurt.

37:31.041 --> 37:32.417
Who took the phone from Alex?

37:35.625 --> 37:36.917
Who was it?

37:39.208 --> 37:40.875
(Valens)
'So you're the..'

37:40.959 --> 37:42.250
'...secret..'

37:42.333 --> 37:43.917
'...to Havenhurst's success.'

37:44.000 --> 37:46.542
I mean, you come early,
stay late.

37:46.625 --> 37:49.000
You're there weekends, holidays.

37:49.083 --> 37:50.750
My work is my passion.

37:50.834 --> 37:52.375
The problem is your passion

37:52.458 --> 37:53.750
is a business.

37:55.125 --> 37:56.750
We found this
in your apartment..

37:57.709 --> 37:59.166
'...when we searched it.'

38:00.417 --> 38:01.917
- You searched my apartment?
- 'Yeah.'

38:02.000 --> 38:04.500
That's you at Judge
Alvarez's ski house

38:04.583 --> 38:05.792
where you go every year.

38:05.875 --> 38:07.417
Yeah, they're-they're
business trips.

38:07.500 --> 38:10.500
(Valens)
'Oh, that's not how
the judge put it.'

38:10.583 --> 38:12.750
I mean, he ain't going
to jail for you.

38:12.834 --> 38:14.041
I mean, that's for sure.

38:14.125 --> 38:15.917
(Rush)
'Well, you meant well, Evan'

38:16.000 --> 38:18.083
till you started hanging
with the big dogs

38:18.166 --> 38:19.375
seeing what money could buy.

38:23.917 --> 38:25.333
I'm not interested in money.

38:25.417 --> 38:27.417
Yeah, if that was true,
you'd have put up a fight

38:27.500 --> 38:29.875
every time the judge's family
cut your budget

38:29.959 --> 38:32.083
or stuck you with bad staff,
or too many kids.

38:32.166 --> 38:33.500
I tried.

38:33.583 --> 38:34.792
Nobody would listen.

38:39.041 --> 38:41.500
We searched your office
too, Evan.

38:42.667 --> 38:44.542
Thing about luminol..

38:44.625 --> 38:47.208
no matter how long
the blood's been there

38:47.291 --> 38:49.792
no matter how hard
you try to scrub it out..

38:51.208 --> 38:52.500
...we're gonna find it.

38:54.041 --> 38:57.917
(Valens)
'You killed Alex there'

38:58.000 --> 38:59.625
dragged him to his room.

39:06.375 --> 39:08.041
I was trying to reason with him.

39:08.125 --> 39:09.542
He wanted Michael transferred.

39:11.083 --> 39:13.667
I was gonna do it. I did.

39:13.750 --> 39:16.750
Afterwards, out of guilt.

39:16.834 --> 39:18.291
(Valens)
'Yeah, but that night'

39:18.375 --> 39:19.834
all you could see was

39:19.917 --> 39:22.875
Havenhurst, your passion
in jeopardy.

39:28.625 --> 39:29.834
Please, just..

39:36.834 --> 39:38.333
...let me tell
you
what happened.

39:43.125 --> 39:45.458
What is the matter
with you, Alex?

39:45.542 --> 39:47.291
You got a problem, come to me.

39:47.375 --> 39:49.291
Your thug, Laticia tried
to kill Michael tonight.

39:49.375 --> 39:51.291
He shouldn't even be
here.
He's a little kid.

39:51.375 --> 39:52.458
Okay, okay.

39:52.542 --> 39:53.667
If Laticia did
something wrong

39:53.750 --> 39:55.166
we'll talk to her about it.

39:55.250 --> 39:56.959
If this isn't the right fit
for Michael

39:57.041 --> 39:58.125
we'll address that.

39:58.208 --> 39:59.417
We can work all of this out.

39:59.500 --> 40:02.083
- Sit down.
- It's beyond circle time,
man.

40:02.166 --> 40:04.041
You wanna work it out, pick up
that phone and call the judge.

40:04.125 --> 40:06.458
- He's the boss.
- I run Havenhurst.

40:06.542 --> 40:08.583
If you're in charge, why
don't
you fix the problems?

40:08.667 --> 40:11.291
Too many kids getting
screwed
over, not just Michael.

40:11.375 --> 40:12.959
Damn, why don't you do
something about it?

40:13.041 --> 40:15.542
Do you know how hard I work
to keep this place going?

40:17.208 --> 40:18.959
Enough to get you there, right?

40:19.041 --> 40:20.458
Jurisprudence, my ass.

40:20.542 --> 40:23.000
You're just like the
judge,
in it to get paid.

40:23.083 --> 40:25.041
That is completely out of line.

40:25.125 --> 40:27.166
We can talk about this, Alex.

40:27.250 --> 40:28.834
'What are you doing?'

40:28.917 --> 40:30.208
Give me the number
for Channel 2 news.

40:30.291 --> 40:32.000
Damn it, Alex.
You put that phone down.

40:32.083 --> 40:33.333
You wanna talk?
Talk to the
cameras.

40:33.417 --> 40:34.667
'Cause you're going
down
with the rest of 'em.

40:34.750 --> 40:36.542
I said listen to me!

40:42.083 --> 40:43.959
Quiet!
Just be quiet!

40:48.917 --> 40:50.166
Shut up.

40:51.417 --> 40:52.500
'Shut up.'

40:53.333 --> 40:54.583
Let me think.

40:58.166 --> 40:59.333
'Just let me think.'
