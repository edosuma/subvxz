I HAVE A DEATHLY
FEAR OF SPIDERS.

18:01.033 --> 18:03.700
THE WAY YOU JUMPED
THROUGH THAT WINDOW,
YOU DO.

18:03.700 --> 18:06.200
IT'S OK, RAVEN.
I MEAN, I OVERREACTED.

18:06.200 --> 18:09.667
BUT I'M SURE
DR. STUCKERMAN
WILL UNDERSTAND.

18:13.500 --> 18:15.000
MISS DEARBORN,

18:15.000 --> 18:17.567
YOU'RE NEGLIGENT
AND IRRESPONSIBLE.

18:17.567 --> 18:20.000
YOU'RE FIRED.

18:23.367 --> 18:25.400
SO WHAT'S UP, RAY?
HOW'D IT GO?

18:25.400 --> 18:27.600
SHE GOT FIRED,
JUST LIKE MY VISION.

18:27.600 --> 18:29.200
IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

18:29.200 --> 18:30.834
YES, IT IS.

18:30.834 --> 18:32.934
I JUST COULDN'T
CONVINCE DR. STUCKERMAN

18:32.934 --> 18:35.200
THAT THAT SPIDER
WASN'T IMAGINARY.

18:35.200 --> 18:37.300
NO, YOU COULDN'T.

18:37.300 --> 18:38.400
AND IF HE SAW A REAL SPIDER,

18:38.400 --> 18:41.000
HE'D HAVE TO GIVE COURTNEY
HER JOB BACK.

18:41.000 --> 18:41.767
YES, HE WOULD.

18:41.767 --> 18:43.700
OH, MY GOODNESS.
YOU'RE SO RIGHT.

18:43.700 --> 18:44.667
ALL I HAVE TO DO

18:44.667 --> 18:46.400
IS GO DOWN
TO THE SCIENCE LAB.

18:46.400 --> 18:48.467
YOU JUST GAVE ME
A GREAT IDEA!

18:48.467 --> 18:50.300
REALLY? WHEN YOU'RE
DONE WITH IT,

18:50.300 --> 18:51.000
CAN I HAVE IT BACK?

18:51.000 --> 18:54.367
YOU KNOW, I DON'T REALLY
GET THOSE THAT OFTEN.

18:54.367 --> 18:56.567
NO, YOU DON'T.

18:56.567 --> 18:58.300
WELL...

19:01.834 --> 19:03.200
DID YOU GET THE SPIDER?

19:03.200 --> 19:04.000
NO PROBLEM.

19:04.000 --> 19:05.100
I THOUGHT IT WAS LOCKED.

19:05.100 --> 19:08.500
LUCKILY, THE KEY
WAS IN THE LOCK.

19:08.500 --> 19:10.700
HMM.

19:10.700 --> 19:13.400
GOOD MORNING, CLASS.

19:13.400 --> 19:17.133
I SAID GOOD MORNING,
CLASS.

19:17.133 --> 19:19.400
GOOD MORNING, DR.

19:19.400 --> 19:21.500
STUCKERMAN.
BINGO.

19:22.867 --> 19:24.000
MISS DEARBORN HAS DECIDED

19:24.000 --> 19:27.133
THAT SHE NEEDS TO SPEND
MORE TIME WITH HER FAMILY,

19:27.133 --> 19:29.600
SO I'LL BE TAKING OVER
HER CLASS.

19:29.600 --> 19:31.367
AND THE FIRST ORDER
OF BUSINESS

19:31.367 --> 19:34.367
IT MAKING UP THAT TEST
THAT YOU MISSED.

19:34.367 --> 19:35.767
[STUDENTS GROAN]

19:35.767 --> 19:37.467
THAT'S RIGHT.

19:37.467 --> 19:41.000
I GOT SOME BUSINESS
OF MY OWN.

19:43.300 --> 19:43.800
[GASP]

19:43.800 --> 19:46.400
HEY, YOU GUYS,
THE SPIDER IS GONE.

19:46.400 --> 19:48.500
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
THE SPIDER'S GONE?

19:48.500 --> 19:51.600
YOU GUYS,
WHERE DID IT GO?

19:55.867 --> 19:58.100
WHERE'D IT GO?

19:59.600 --> 20:01.100
HEY, RAY, CUTE HAT.

20:01.100 --> 20:02.800
DID YOU GET THAT
AT SASSY'S

20:02.800 --> 20:03.400
WHAT HAT?

20:03.400 --> 20:05.000
THE ONE
MOVING ON YOUR HEAD.

20:05.000 --> 20:08.867
OH, WAIT.
HATS DON'T MOVE.

20:10.400 --> 20:11.667
AAH!

20:11.667 --> 20:13.767
GET IT OFF ME! GET IT OFF!

20:13.767 --> 20:16.834
HEY,
THAT'S THE REAL SPIDER!

20:17.400 --> 20:18.767
SPIDER!

20:18.767 --> 20:21.600
I HATE SPIDERS!

20:21.600 --> 20:23.400
OUT OF MY WAY!

20:23.400 --> 20:26.600
SPIDER! SPIDER!

20:26.600 --> 20:29.000
SPIDER! SPIDER!

20:29.000 --> 20:32.200
SPIDER! SPIDER!

20:32.200 --> 20:33.300
IS HE OK?

20:33.300 --> 20:35.300
WELL,
HE'S STILL RUNNING.

20:35.300 --> 20:38.000
I THINK WE'D BETTER
TAKE A EARLY LUNCH.

20:38.000 --> 20:40.100
WAIT. WE SHOULD
FIND THE SPIDER FIRST!

20:40.100 --> 20:42.500
YOU'RE RIGHT. HE HAS TO BE
AROUND HERE SOMEWHERE.

20:42.500 --> 20:45.600
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
IT'S OK. HE'LL SHOW UP.

20:45.600 --> 20:47.600
HE WILL, SO...

20:52.367 --> 20:53.600
AAH!

20:53.600 --> 20:55.700
SPIDER! SPIDER!

20:55.700 --> 20:57.500
SPIDER!

20:57.500 --> 21:01.200
SPIDER! SPIDER!

21:03.500 --> 21:06.400
WE ARE SO GLAD TO HAVE
YOU BACK, COURTNEY.

21:06.400 --> 21:07.200
THANK YOU.

21:07.200 --> 21:08.600
IS DR. STUCKERMAN
COMING BACK?

21:08.600 --> 21:11.734
ACTUALLY, DR. STUCKERMAN'S
TAKING SOME TIME OFF

21:11.734 --> 21:14.100
TO FINISH THAT NOVEL
HE'S, UM,

21:14.100 --> 21:14.667
READING.

21:14.667 --> 21:17.400
I HOPE YOU GUYS ALL
STUDIED FOR YOUR TEST.

21:17.400 --> 21:18.400
OH, YEAH, I DID,

21:18.400 --> 21:19.367
AND I JUST WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE

21:19.367 --> 21:22.100
FOR THE WHOLE
SPIDER JUMPING THROUGH
THE WINDOW FIASCO.

21:22.100 --> 21:23.834
YEAH,
LET'S NOT RELIVE IT.

21:23.834 --> 21:24.734
OH, YEAH, OK.

21:24.734 --> 21:26.800
ALTHOUGH IT WAS
A GOOD LESSON FOR ME

21:26.800 --> 21:28.500
ON HOW DESPERATE
STUDENTS CAN BE

21:28.500 --> 21:30.700
TO GET OUT OF A TEST.

21:32.834 --> 21:34.800
GRRR!

21:34.800 --> 21:35.667
BEAR!

21:35.667 --> 21:38.500
CHELS, IT'S OK.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.233
YEAH.
NICE TRY, EDDIE.

21:40.233 --> 21:42.400
NOW TAKE YOUR SEAT.

21:44.367 --> 21:47.000
HOW'D SHE KNOW
I WASN'T A BEAR?

21:47.000 --> 21:48.667
WELL,
UH, FOR ONE THING,

21:48.667 --> 21:50.000
BEARS DON'T HAVE
ZIPPERS.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.700
OH, AND, UH,
BY THE WAY, DUDE--
