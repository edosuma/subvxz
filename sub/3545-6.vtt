00:00.208 --> 00:02.000
<i>Previously on </i>Desperate Housewives...

00:02.083 --> 00:05.458
- I know why my mum killed herself.
<i>- Secrets were revealed.</i>

00:05.542 --> 00:07.959
I think we should go to the police.

00:08.041 --> 00:11.625
<i>- Relationships got complicated.</i>
- What are you doing here?

00:11.709 --> 00:14.625
- You think she's cheating on you?
- I think so.

00:14.709 --> 00:16.583
We got a call about a break-in.

00:16.709 --> 00:19.166
I've seen a lot
but this is something else.

00:19.250 --> 00:22.959
<i>- And the mystery...</i>
- Why did you do this?

00:23.041 --> 00:25.125
- I don't know.
<i>- ...deepened.</i>

00:32.291 --> 00:34.792
<i>Suburbia is a battle ground,</i>

00:34.875 --> 00:38.208
<i>an arena for all forms</i>
<i>of domestic combat.</i>

00:38.333 --> 00:43.375
<i>Husbands clash with wives,</i>
<i>parents cross swords with children.</i>

00:43.458 --> 00:46.583
<i>But the bloodiest battles</i>
<i>often involve women</i>

00:46.667 --> 00:48.834
<i>and their mothers-in-law.</i>

00:48.917 --> 00:52.417
<i>The war for control of Carlos</i>
<i>began the night he proposed,</i>

00:52.542 --> 00:56.583
<i>and Gabrielle had been losing ground</i>
<i>to Juanita ever since.</i>

00:56.667 --> 01:01.458
<i>From the prenuptial agreement</i>
<i>which she reluctantly signed...</i>

01:04.709 --> 01:08.750
<i>...to the selection of wedding music</i>
<i>she despised...</i>

01:11.083 --> 01:14.375
<i>to the color of the house paint</i>
<i>she hadn't wanted,</i>

01:14.458 --> 01:18.250
<i>Gabrielle had suffered</i>
<i>one defeat after another.</i>

01:19.583 --> 01:24.375
<i>And now that Juanita suspected</i>
<i>her daughter-in-law of having an affair,</i>

01:24.458 --> 01:27.458
<i>it had become increasingly apparent,</i>
<i>in this war...</i>

01:27.583 --> 01:29.917
Mrs. Solis, I'll be at the market.

01:30.000 --> 01:33.125
<i>...no prisoners would be taken.</i>

01:33.250 --> 01:36.083
Thank you, Yao Lin.

01:36.208 --> 01:39.750
I don't see why you have her.

01:39.834 --> 01:41.959
It's a big house. I need help.

01:43.000 --> 01:46.917
It's only called help
when you do some of the work yourself.

01:47.000 --> 01:48.834
I supervise.

01:50.208 --> 01:52.834
You pay her $300 a week.

01:54.083 --> 01:56.875
That's $15,000 a year.

01:56.959 --> 02:01.375
Carlos, you always say you're not
putting away enough for retirement.

02:01.458 --> 02:04.375
Baby, it would be a good idea
to cut back on expenses.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.834
You want me to take care
of this place alone?

02:06.917 --> 02:09.000
Other women manage.

02:31.834 --> 02:34.208
That's nice.

02:34.333 --> 02:36.625
- You like that?
- Yeah.

02:37.875 --> 02:40.834
God, I'm gonna miss this, Carlos.

02:41.834 --> 02:43.959
What do you mean?

02:44.041 --> 02:48.333
Well, since I'm gonna have to be
doing the cooking

02:48.417 --> 02:53.000
and the cleaning and all the shopping
like the other wives,

02:53.083 --> 02:57.375
I'm gonna be exhausted at night,
just like all the other wives.

02:58.375 --> 03:01.208
Till I build up my stamina, of course.

03:01.291 --> 03:04.166
And that might take a couple of years.

03:12.750 --> 03:17.125
<i>Sadly for Juanita, she had ignored</i>
<i>the first rule of war.</i>

03:17.208 --> 03:20.083
- Good morning, Carlos.
- The maid stays.

03:22.583 --> 03:26.583
<i>Never underestimate your enemy.</i>

04:08.625 --> 04:10.750
<i>Of the many suburban rituals,</i>

04:10.834 --> 04:16.041
<i>none is quite so cherished</i>
<i>as the neighborhood yard sale.</i>

04:16.125 --> 04:18.083
<i>Shoppers come to sift through</i>

04:18.166 --> 04:21.208
<i>the discarded belongings</i>
<i>of someone they don't know,</i>

04:21.291 --> 04:24.583
<i>in hopes of finding bargains</i>
<i>they don't really need,</i>

04:24.667 --> 04:28.625
<i>each so determined to save a few pennies</i>

04:28.709 --> 04:31.959
<i>they often miss hidden treasures.</i>

04:34.500 --> 04:37.917
- Hey, Paul.
- Hi, Susan.

04:38.000 --> 04:41.417
I was a little surprised
to see Mary Alice's award for sale.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.375
She got it for doing charity work.

04:44.458 --> 04:48.375
Zach and I are moving. We don't need
to carry any more than is necessary.

04:48.458 --> 04:53.041
That makes sense. I just wanted to make
sure you didn't want it for Zach.

04:53.125 --> 04:55.500
Something to remember his mother by.

04:55.583 --> 04:58.917
Zach doesn't need a piece of glass
to remember his mother.

04:59.000 --> 05:04.166
I'm out of newspaper. Here.
Let's call it ten bucks for everything.

05:04.291 --> 05:09.083
Great. Speaking of Zach...
I haven't seen him around lately.

05:09.166 --> 05:13.417
He's been a bit depressed.
I sent him to stay with relatives.

05:13.500 --> 05:16.291
- Oh. Which ones?
- You don't know them.

05:17.875 --> 05:20.625
- How did you get the fat lip?
- The usual way.

05:20.709 --> 05:23.500
Asking too many questions.

05:30.500 --> 05:33.250
- Did you find out where Zach is?
- No.

05:33.333 --> 05:36.083
But he's not staying with relatives.

05:36.208 --> 05:39.959
It could be any one of these guys
she's having an affair with.

05:40.041 --> 05:43.041
Don't worry.
I'm not letting her out of my sight.

05:43.166 --> 05:45.208
Who the hell is that?

05:45.291 --> 05:48.417
Do you think that's the guy
she's having an affair with?

05:48.500 --> 05:53.500
Carlos, a guy she talks to in public
isn't someone you're gonna worry about.

05:53.625 --> 05:56.917
So it's someone
that she doesn't talk to.

05:57.000 --> 05:59.792
Do I have to beat up every guy in town?

05:59.917 --> 06:02.000
Marriage takes work.

06:03.375 --> 06:07.291
He would play it close to the vest.
Paul knows we're onto him.

06:07.417 --> 06:11.834
Zach said Mary Alice killed herself
because of something he'd done.

06:11.917 --> 06:14.875
Is there anyone
who'd know what he was talking about?

06:14.959 --> 06:17.792
No. We have to find him.
It's the only way we'll know.

06:17.875 --> 06:22.625
Zach is such a sweet kid. I can't
imagine he'd do anything that terrible.

06:22.709 --> 06:26.458
He did break into your house.
He's obviously troubled in some way.

06:30.834 --> 06:34.625
Severe depression,
borderline personality disorder.

06:36.000 --> 06:40.000
- Zach is a deeply troubled young man.
- I'm aware of that.

06:40.083 --> 06:44.000
- What are you giving him?
- Antidepressants and a mood stabilizer.

06:44.083 --> 06:45.166
Good.

06:45.250 --> 06:49.542
I'm also recommending extensive
psychotherapy to help unearth...

06:49.625 --> 06:52.250
I don't think so.

06:53.959 --> 06:58.500
Mr. Young,
I can't just medicate him indefinitely.

06:58.583 --> 07:01.750
Forget the Freud
and stick with the drugs.

07:01.834 --> 07:04.667
No new treatments without my permission.

07:09.250 --> 07:13.458
I think this is going to be a great
version of <i>Little Red Riding Hood.</i>

07:13.583 --> 07:19.000
It is your involvement that makes
the plays here at Barcliff so special.

07:19.083 --> 07:21.959
Thank you.

07:22.041 --> 07:25.000
I would like to turn over
the next part of our meeting

07:25.083 --> 07:28.750
to our parent coordinator,
the amazing Maisy Gibbons.

07:31.458 --> 07:34.625
Thank you, Miss Truesdale.
Now before everyone leaves,

07:34.750 --> 07:37.959
we have new copies
of the script up here.

07:38.041 --> 07:41.875
Tilda and Frances and I
went to the rehearsal yesterday,

07:42.000 --> 07:45.417
and we were a little troubled
by the ending.

07:45.500 --> 07:48.834
Killing the wolf.
It sends the wrong message to our kids.

07:48.917 --> 07:53.834
We believe that animals should
only be euthanized as a last resort.

07:58.834 --> 08:02.917
- Do you find something amusing?
- I'm sorry. I thought you were kidding.

08:06.709 --> 08:11.917
In our version, the wolf is aggressive
because he has a thorn in his paw,

08:12.041 --> 08:15.625
and the woodsman will take out the thorn
and send Mr. Wolf on his way.

08:15.709 --> 08:18.834
I'm sorry.
Aren't we doing <i>Little Red Riding Hood?</i>

08:18.917 --> 08:22.083
- Yes.
- You know that the wolf is a bad guy?

08:22.166 --> 08:24.208
He eats Little Red's grandma.

08:24.333 --> 08:29.125
If you let him go, he's gonna chow down
on other defenseless old ladies.

08:29.208 --> 08:32.291
- I'm sorry. And you are?
- I'm Lynette Scavo.

08:32.375 --> 08:35.834
My twins just joined.
They're playing oak trees.

08:35.917 --> 08:38.417
Of course. Lynette.

08:38.542 --> 08:43.166
Let's see. You are signed up to take
tickets the night of the show, right?

08:43.250 --> 08:46.625
- Yeah.
- Well, with all due respect,

08:46.709 --> 08:49.000
let's leave the creative suggestions

08:49.083 --> 08:52.083
to the mothers
who have assumed the heavy lifting.

08:53.166 --> 08:56.959
Sure. Whatever.

08:57.041 --> 09:00.709
I must say I'm jealous
of how much time you two spend together.

09:00.792 --> 09:04.792
My mother-in-law would
never want to hang out with me all day.

09:04.875 --> 09:07.083
She sounds nice.

09:09.041 --> 09:10.875
Hey there, you two.

09:10.959 --> 09:13.125
Hi, John.

09:13.250 --> 09:15.959
Mrs. Solis.

09:16.083 --> 09:19.208
I wasn't aware you two were friends.

09:19.291 --> 09:24.417
- Yeah. We go to the same school.
- Of course you do.

09:24.500 --> 09:26.709
We'll be upstairs in my room studying.

09:26.792 --> 09:29.166
Have fun.

09:33.875 --> 09:37.667
Doesn't it make you nervous?
A boy alone upstairs with Danielle?

09:37.750 --> 09:41.750
I don't worry about John. Both he and
Danielle are in the abstinence club.

09:45.959 --> 09:48.291
Coffee's a little hot.

09:54.458 --> 09:57.792
<i>Susan was infuriated</i>
<i>by Paul's evasive answers.</i>

09:59.792 --> 10:03.375
<i>She was convinced</i>
<i>he was deliberately hiding Zach</i>

10:03.458 --> 10:05.834
<i>and hiding the truth.</i>

10:06.709 --> 10:10.792
<i>She hoped that finding one</i>
<i>would lead to the other.</i>

10:12.417 --> 10:17.166
<i>To succeed, Susan would</i>
<i>have to be evasive herself.</i>

10:21.166 --> 10:24.583
- Susan. Long time no see.
- Mrs. Greenberg.

10:24.667 --> 10:29.583
Do you remember those two eggs
I let you borrow last Christmas?

10:29.667 --> 10:34.250
- I need those back.
- Gosh, honey, I'm fresh out.

10:34.333 --> 10:38.125
- But I could run to the store.
- Oh, forget about it.

10:38.208 --> 10:40.458
It's not that important.

10:40.542 --> 10:45.125
But since I'm here, do you still have
that hatchback sitting in your garage?

10:45.250 --> 10:48.583
- Can I borrow it tomorrow?
- You want to borrow my car?

10:48.667 --> 10:50.458
Just for a couple of hours.

10:50.542 --> 10:53.709
I'm not sure.
Do you know how to drive a stick?

10:53.834 --> 10:56.417
Yes, I think so. I learned in college.

10:56.500 --> 10:58.625
It's like riding a bike, right?

10:58.709 --> 11:02.625
- I'm not sure, dear.
- It's just for a couple of hours.

11:02.709 --> 11:05.709
I let you borrow my eggs
for a whole year.

11:06.667 --> 11:10.959
I'm very pleased with the work
we've done in our sessions thus far.

11:11.041 --> 11:15.083
- We're making excellent progress.
- Thank you. I feel good about it.

11:15.166 --> 11:19.667
But there are a few areas of your
marriage we haven't covered yet.

11:19.750 --> 11:21.583
Really? Like what?

11:26.875 --> 11:29.417
I've told Dr Goldfine
in our private sessions

11:29.542 --> 11:32.041
that I'm not happy with our sex life.

11:36.250 --> 11:40.917
And Rex feels that
when the two of you have intercourse,

11:41.041 --> 11:43.875
you're not as connected as you could be.

11:43.959 --> 11:45.750
- Connected?
- Yeah.

11:45.875 --> 11:49.458
Like you're thinking about other things.
Is your hair messed up?

11:49.542 --> 11:52.458
Did you buy the toothpaste?
You're just not there.

11:52.583 --> 11:56.625
This kind of disconnect is often
a symptom of a deeper problem.

11:56.709 --> 12:00.834
So we were talking and the idea
of a sexual surrogate came up.

12:00.917 --> 12:04.875
This is a licensed professional
who'd work with you as a couple

12:04.959 --> 12:08.000
on solving whatever sexual problems
you may be having.

12:08.083 --> 12:10.417
I have an excellent referral.

12:10.500 --> 12:14.291
And what would this
sexual surrogate person do?

12:14.375 --> 12:16.750
- She would coach us.
- She?

12:16.834 --> 12:19.750
She's discreet.
You'll hardly notice she's there.

12:21.500 --> 12:25.375
So she would be in the room with us
while we make love?

12:25.500 --> 12:29.709
Yes. Helping us to achieve
maximum sexual potential.

12:31.500 --> 12:35.250
- Do you have any questions?
- Just one.

12:35.333 --> 12:38.125
How much longer
will your mid-life crisis last?

12:38.208 --> 12:41.792
Because it is really starting
to tick me off.

12:54.291 --> 12:56.625
Right. Everyone's down for a nap.

12:56.750 --> 12:59.875
We've got no more than an hour.
Let's get cracking.

12:59.959 --> 13:02.333
Five-card draw. Nothing wild.

13:05.458 --> 13:08.709
- How is it going with Mike, Susan?
- It's going, finally.

13:08.792 --> 13:12.333
We have a date next week. He's taking me
to see a play or something.

13:12.417 --> 13:16.667
Might I suggest the Barcliff Academy
production of <i>Little Red Riding Hood?</i>

13:16.792 --> 13:19.542
That's right. The twins' stage debut.

13:19.667 --> 13:22.333
- Are they having fun?
- Sure. They play oak trees.

13:22.417 --> 13:25.083
I have to deal with the drama
behind the scenes.

13:25.166 --> 13:28.125
- You've met Maisy Gibbons?
- She's a total nightmare.

13:28.250 --> 13:30.875
- I shouldn't have challenged her.
- Oh, dear.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.625
Now no one on the committee
wants to talk to me.

13:33.709 --> 13:36.834
Maisy does love
to rule her little kingdom.

13:36.917 --> 13:40.417
Hasn't changed since Girl Scouts.
Girls smile to your face

13:40.500 --> 13:43.667
then make fun of you
'cause you're not shaving your legs yet.

13:43.750 --> 13:47.083
That wouldn't happen in Boy Scouts.

13:47.166 --> 13:49.959
When I worked with men,
I preferred how they fought.

13:50.041 --> 13:52.625
A guy takes his opponent on
face-to-face,

13:52.709 --> 13:54.709
and once he's won, he's top dog.

13:56.250 --> 13:59.208
- It's primitive but fair.
- And a lot less sneaky.

13:59.291 --> 14:02.834
Isn't it sexist of us
to generalize like this?

14:02.917 --> 14:06.333
It's science.
Sociologists have documented this stuff.

14:06.458 --> 14:09.709
Well, who am I
to argue with sociologists?

14:12.000 --> 14:15.917
This guacamole has got a kick.

14:16.000 --> 14:20.291
I'm gonna run to the little girl's room.
You go ahead. I might be a while.

14:20.375 --> 14:23.417
I hate playing three-handed poker.
Let's take a break.

14:23.542 --> 14:26.625
- I'll play.
- You play poker?

14:26.709 --> 14:29.500
- I played with my grandfather.
- Pull up a chair.

14:29.583 --> 14:31.709
You're just playing for chips?

14:31.834 --> 14:36.458
My grandfather used to say
it's always more fun to play for money.

14:36.542 --> 14:39.000
- Why not? 50 cents a bet?
- Make it a buck.

14:39.083 --> 14:41.542
Three raise limit, $20 buy-in.

15:09.458 --> 15:14.875
- Mrs. Solis. What are you doing?
- Why haven't you returned my calls?

15:15.959 --> 15:19.041
- I've been busy.
- I've seen who you've been busy with.

15:19.125 --> 15:22.625
Danielle? Come on. She's just a friend.

15:22.709 --> 15:25.417
Before you get any friendlier,
let me remind you,

15:25.542 --> 15:28.083
I can do things to you
she can't even pronounce.

15:28.166 --> 15:32.041
A lot of good it does me with your
mother-in-law following you around.

15:32.125 --> 15:35.000
Maybe we should just cool it
for a while.

15:35.083 --> 15:37.041
No, John, please don't say that.

15:37.125 --> 15:39.792
I have everything under control.

15:44.625 --> 15:47.125
Now give me a boost.

15:47.250 --> 15:49.709
Hey. So what did I miss?

15:49.792 --> 15:53.917
Not much. Just a few friendly hands
of poker with the girls.

16:09.834 --> 16:12.083
I'm sorry I'm late.

16:12.166 --> 16:17.000
As I'm sure you've all heard, Celia Bond
broke her wrist playing tennis.

16:17.083 --> 16:20.750
Which means we are now in need
of someone to do the costumes.

16:20.834 --> 16:24.291
I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
Are there any volunteers?

16:24.375 --> 16:28.458
- I'll do it.
- Really? Do you know how to sew?

16:28.542 --> 16:30.917
Absolutely.

16:31.000 --> 16:34.166
Well, great. Thank you, Lynette.

16:40.750 --> 16:45.500
OK. So now that
I'm going to do some "heavy lifting",

16:45.583 --> 16:49.792
I believe I have the right to talk about
the changes made to the script?

16:55.750 --> 16:57.959
Ladies.

16:58.041 --> 17:02.208
We grew up with <i>Little Red Riding Hood,</i>
and survived it, scary stuff and all.

17:02.291 --> 17:05.250
So I say to hell
with political correctness.

17:05.375 --> 17:09.500
Let our kids experience this classic
like it was meant to be enjoyed.

17:09.583 --> 17:13.208
Let's kill the damn wolf
and just put on the best show we can.

17:19.291 --> 17:22.709
Thank you, Lynette,
for that impassioned speech.

17:22.792 --> 17:26.667
- But I believe that ship has sailed.
- No. It hasn't.

17:26.750 --> 17:29.917
We still have time
to change the ending back.

17:31.458 --> 17:34.250
And, you know, Maisy,
it is just a fairy tale.

17:34.375 --> 17:37.500
I don't think
it will upset the children.

17:37.583 --> 17:41.041
- I think you're wrong.
- That's what's great about democracy.

17:41.125 --> 17:43.375
Everyone's entitled to their opinion.

17:43.458 --> 17:46.250
Also, everyone has a right to vote.

17:46.333 --> 17:51.125
So all in favor of the woodsman going
medieval on the big bad wolf's ass.

19:12.291 --> 19:14.458
Dr Goldfine.

19:14.542 --> 19:17.375
- Bree.
- You're dining alone?

19:17.458 --> 19:20.500
- Actually, I am.
- What a coincidence. So am I.

19:20.583 --> 19:24.250
Seems a shame for us to eat
by ourselves. Shall I pull up a chair?

19:24.333 --> 19:29.417
Bree, it's nothing personal,
but I never socialize with clients.

19:31.917 --> 19:35.750
I get it. I'm so sorry.
Of course. It's inappropriate.

19:37.709 --> 19:41.750
It's just that after yesterday
there's so much I need to say because...

19:45.875 --> 19:48.083
I suppose it can wait.

20:14.417 --> 20:17.250
No, Lynette, I'm sorry.
Juanita's taking a bath.

20:18.250 --> 20:21.000
How much did she win from you?

20:21.083 --> 20:23.291
Jeez.

20:23.417 --> 20:25.875
Yeah, I guess she'll take a check.

20:25.959 --> 20:28.834
OK. All right. Bye.

20:28.917 --> 20:32.959
- What was that about?
- Your mother is quite the card shark.

20:33.083 --> 20:36.291
You let her play cards?
How long did she play?

20:36.417 --> 20:38.583
Not that long. Why?

20:39.792 --> 20:42.417
Carlos, what is it?

20:45.667 --> 20:49.792
I never told you this, but my mother
had a serious gambling problem.

20:51.125 --> 20:53.750
Was this before we were married?

20:53.875 --> 20:56.458
Yeah. It was bad.

20:57.458 --> 21:02.166
She went into debt. Dipped into her
savings, started hocking jewelry.

21:02.291 --> 21:05.291
Honey, it was only
a small neighborhood game.

21:05.417 --> 21:08.834
It doesn't take much
for her to fall off the wagon.

21:08.959 --> 21:11.500
I know she seems like
a very strong woman but...

21:11.583 --> 21:14.041
She has a major weakness.

21:15.583 --> 21:20.208
Honey... It's OK.

21:20.291 --> 21:23.000
You were right to tell me this.

21:24.125 --> 21:27.458
And you understand
I have to treat this as a session.

21:27.542 --> 21:29.500
Of course. That's fine.

21:29.625 --> 21:33.458
- Shall I include the meal?
- No. We'll split that.

21:39.208 --> 21:41.583
So let's talk about yesterday.

21:41.667 --> 21:45.041
Do you think there might have been
some truth in what Rex said?

21:45.166 --> 21:46.875
No, I don't.

21:47.000 --> 21:51.542
Bree, it's not uncommon for people
experiencing sexual repression

21:51.667 --> 21:53.875
to distance themselves during the act.

21:54.000 --> 21:59.792
Do you see me as some sort of prude
who just lays there like a cold fish?

22:00.333 --> 22:03.291
- I love sex.
- All right.

22:03.375 --> 22:07.583
I love everything about it.
The sensations. The smells.

22:07.667 --> 22:10.125
I especially love the feel of a man.

22:10.208 --> 22:13.500
All that muscle and sinew
pressed against my body.

22:13.625 --> 22:16.542
And then when you add friction.

22:18.875 --> 22:21.375
The tactile sensation
of running my tongue

22:21.458 --> 22:24.125
over a man's nipple ever so gently.

22:24.208 --> 22:27.750
And then there's the act itself.
Two bodies becoming one,

22:27.875 --> 22:30.834
and that final eruption of pleasure.

22:32.166 --> 22:35.083
The only thing I don't like about sex
is the scrotum.

22:35.208 --> 22:38.709
Obviously it has its practical
applications, but I'm not a fan.

22:40.250 --> 22:42.834
Can I get you something?

22:42.959 --> 22:45.375
Just the check, please.

22:45.500 --> 22:48.166
Sir, you haven't ordered yet.

22:53.125 --> 22:55.834
- We're not shopping?
- Let's stop here for lunch.

22:55.959 --> 23:00.500
This place has the best buffet in town.
All-you-can-eat crab legs.

23:01.500 --> 23:05.333
- Oh, no.
- What's wrong? Let's go.

23:05.417 --> 23:09.583
It's late. They're only holding
the suede mini for me until 2:00.

23:09.667 --> 23:13.083
If we stay I'll never make it.
We'll just have lunch at the mall.

23:13.208 --> 23:16.709
Wait.
I'm really in the mood for crab legs.

23:16.792 --> 23:21.375
- Drop me off and you can come back.
- It might take over an hour.

23:21.458 --> 23:24.041
It's a buffet. There's no rush.

23:30.250 --> 23:34.583
Hi, John. Motel. Ten minutes. Be there.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.375
All right. Off you go. Thanks.

23:40.458 --> 23:46.417
Lynette, I noticed you forgot the
coonskin on that hunter's coonskin cap.

23:46.542 --> 23:49.083
Yeah. That was a creative call.

23:52.333 --> 23:56.834
I'm in the middle of a crisis. If I
don't take shortcuts I'll never finish.

23:56.959 --> 24:00.208
Jordana Geist manages
to get her work done.

24:00.291 --> 24:02.750
She runs the concessions,
paints the sets,

24:02.834 --> 24:06.667
and still has time to take care
of her three kids and a husband.

24:06.750 --> 24:08.625
We can't have the students suffer

24:08.709 --> 24:12.667
just because you don't understand
the concept of time management.

24:12.750 --> 24:16.125
The kids won't suffer
without a clump of fur on their heads.

24:17.333 --> 24:22.250
OK. I'll make a creative call.
We'll cut the oak trees.

24:22.333 --> 24:25.250
That forest is looking
a little dense anyway.

24:27.041 --> 24:30.250
- My boys are the oak trees.
- Are they?

24:30.333 --> 24:34.875
Well, I wouldn't worry. We'll find
something for them to do backstage.

24:35.000 --> 24:38.083
That's where the real action is.

24:38.166 --> 24:42.041
- I'll finish the costumes.
- Well. Crisis averted.

24:49.583 --> 24:54.041
- You have lost your mind.
- I checked up on Silvercrest.

24:54.125 --> 24:56.709
It's a treatment center
for troubled kids.

24:56.834 --> 25:00.291
I create the distraction,
you blend in and find Zach.

25:00.375 --> 25:03.000
How could I blend in
with messed-up teenagers?

25:03.125 --> 25:06.959
I don't know, Julie.
Pretend to be bulimic. Gag a little.

25:07.083 --> 25:09.542
Come on. Work with me here.

25:09.667 --> 25:13.125
When this is over, we need
to talk about your parenting skills.

25:13.208 --> 25:17.083
OK, fine. You don't want to help me,
I'm not gonna force you.

25:17.166 --> 25:19.667
It's not that I don't want to.
It's just...

25:19.750 --> 25:22.208
Why does this mean so much to you?

25:22.291 --> 25:24.667
'Cause Mary Alice was a wonderful
person.

25:24.750 --> 25:29.250
And now all anybody thinks is that
she did this terrible, selfish thing.

25:29.375 --> 25:31.625
And I think there's more to it
than that.

25:31.709 --> 25:37.291
She was my friend, Julie, and I owe it
to her to find out the truth.

25:48.542 --> 25:50.208
Juanita, what's wrong?

26:01.250 --> 26:04.291
Juanita?

26:04.417 --> 26:08.417
I didn't go to the buffet.
I went gambling instead and I lost.

26:08.542 --> 26:12.375
How much did you have on you?
It couldn't have been much.

26:12.458 --> 26:15.083
I used Carlos' credit card.

26:15.166 --> 26:19.291
- OK. How much did you charge?
- I don't know. It stopped working.

26:19.375 --> 26:23.667
What do you mean? This thing has like
a $15,000 credit limit.

26:47.166 --> 26:51.458
The man at the desk said there were
no vacant rooms. Can I bunk with you?

26:51.542 --> 26:54.000
Bree, what are you doing here?

26:54.125 --> 26:58.333
It's a little chilly out here.
Do you mind if we discuss this inside?

27:00.667 --> 27:02.375
Come on in.

27:09.417 --> 27:12.208
Sure is nice and toasty in here.

27:15.333 --> 27:18.750
- You look amazing.
- Thanks.

27:18.834 --> 27:21.333
I was hoping you'd notice.

27:24.000 --> 27:28.000
Well, it certainly isn't the Ritz,
but it has all the essentials.

27:36.542 --> 27:40.959
- I don't know what to say.
- Then perhaps you should say nothing.

28:09.250 --> 28:11.625
Rex? Baby...

28:11.709 --> 28:15.959
- I just need a minute.
- What?

28:18.083 --> 28:22.083
Sweetie, just leave it, will you?
Just leave it.

28:39.333 --> 28:42.208
OK, baby. Where were we?

28:42.291 --> 28:44.333
I told you to leave it.

28:44.417 --> 28:47.417
I'm sorry. I just...

28:47.500 --> 28:51.792
Come on. Are you gonna make
a big deal about this?

28:53.750 --> 28:56.542
You know...

28:56.625 --> 29:02.166
to tell you the truth,
now is not really a good time for me.

29:11.792 --> 29:14.959
It's obvious you've
never had to remove a cheese stain.

29:21.792 --> 29:25.250
Bree, I totally understand.
Yeah, I already tried Susan.

29:25.375 --> 29:28.458
And Gaby can't sew.
Seriously, I'm gonna be fine.

29:28.542 --> 29:31.709
Yeah. Thanks anyway. Bye-bye.

29:31.792 --> 29:35.709
I'm a little ahead with my painting
if you need some help.

29:35.792 --> 29:39.792
Oh, Jordana, you are a life-saver.
Thank you.

29:39.875 --> 29:42.083
Here. These pieces need trim.

29:42.166 --> 29:45.625
I'll help for as long as I can
but I have a lot on my plate tonight.

29:45.750 --> 29:48.250
I have to make 25 mini quiches
for my book club.

29:48.333 --> 29:52.834
You're not human. You were sent by
aliens to make humans feel inadequate.

29:54.250 --> 29:57.667
Seriously, how do you cram it all in?

30:00.166 --> 30:03.500
- Can you keep a secret?
- Sure.

30:15.041 --> 30:18.917
That's ADD medication.
My kids take this. Or they almost did.

30:19.000 --> 30:21.417
I thought it calmed you down.

30:21.542 --> 30:24.458
Has the opposite effect
if you don't have ADD.

30:24.542 --> 30:26.875
Ever chug a pot of Turkish coffee?

30:27.834 --> 30:30.375
You're taking your kids' medication?

30:30.500 --> 30:33.041
Once in a while. Do you want a couple?

30:34.041 --> 30:37.875
That's very kind of you but I just
smoked some crack a little while ago.

30:38.000 --> 30:40.417
I'd better not mix.

30:43.250 --> 30:48.041
I'll sell some jewelry, pay off the
card, and Carlos will never find out.

30:48.125 --> 30:51.583
- You would do that for me?
- Why wouldn't I?

30:51.667 --> 30:53.750
For starters, you hate me.

30:53.834 --> 30:57.542
That is overstating it a little.

30:59.667 --> 31:03.834
The bottom line is, no matter how much
I dislike you, I love Carlos more.

31:07.083 --> 31:11.208
If Carlos finds out, he'll be
devastated. I don't wanna see him hurt.

31:11.333 --> 31:15.875
Don't believe I'm a good person,
but believe I care about my husband.

31:19.208 --> 31:21.083
Fine. To heck with it.

31:21.208 --> 31:25.208
I'm not gonna risk my neck
to protect you. I'm calling Carlos.

31:26.291 --> 31:29.959
<i>Juanita might have been</i>
<i>the gambler of the family...</i>

31:34.000 --> 31:35.375
Wait. I believe you.

31:35.458 --> 31:40.083
<i>...but Gabrielle was the one</i>
<i>who knew how to bluff.</i>

31:47.625 --> 31:50.834
Hi. I'm Susan Mayer. I have
an appointment to see Dr Sicher.

31:50.959 --> 31:54.208
Yes, he's expecting you.
Let me get him for you.

32:06.750 --> 32:09.583
- Hi. I'm Dr Sicher.
- Susan Mayer.

32:09.667 --> 32:12.417
So you're doing research
for a children's book?

32:12.500 --> 32:14.291
I sure am.

32:25.959 --> 32:28.125
Zach?

32:30.917 --> 32:33.000
Hi, Julie.

32:33.834 --> 32:37.959
- What's wrong with you?
- Just all the pills they make me take.

32:39.834 --> 32:42.291
They kinda make me sleepy.

32:42.375 --> 32:45.291
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see how you were.

32:45.375 --> 32:49.834
And to ask you something.
Look, I don't have much time.

32:51.250 --> 32:52.709
What is it?

32:52.834 --> 32:55.583
You told Mrs. Van De Kamp
your mum killed herself

32:55.667 --> 32:57.792
because of something bad you did.

32:57.875 --> 33:00.875
What were you talking about?

33:03.000 --> 33:07.583
After my mum died, I started remembering
things that happened when I was little.

33:09.834 --> 33:13.875
- What happened to Dana.
- Dana? Who's Dana?

33:14.000 --> 33:16.667
What are you doing here?

33:16.792 --> 33:19.333
I was just visiting my friend.

33:19.417 --> 33:22.667
This patient is not allowed visitors.

33:24.125 --> 33:26.083
I guess I have to go.

33:27.917 --> 33:31.083
I am so sorry, Zach.

33:50.417 --> 33:55.125
I don't want to disturb you.
I just left some important papers here.

33:57.583 --> 34:01.250
- What are you doing?
- I'm repairing a chipped mug.

34:01.333 --> 34:04.000
Why don't you just buy a new one?

34:04.083 --> 34:07.041
Because it's better to fix
what you already have.

34:10.542 --> 34:12.291
Listen.

34:15.250 --> 34:19.166
- About what happened today.
- You humiliated me, Rex.

34:19.250 --> 34:21.709
For no good reason.

34:21.792 --> 34:25.166
- I'm sorry.
- I was there. I was willing.

34:25.250 --> 34:30.375
- Normal men don't say no to that.
- You upset me.

34:30.458 --> 34:34.333
See, I don't think that's the reason.

34:34.417 --> 34:40.041
After I left the motel, I did some
thinking about us and our sex life.

34:40.125 --> 34:43.250
I realized there has been a disconnect.

34:43.333 --> 34:46.709
- But it's coming from you.
- That's ridiculous.

34:46.792 --> 34:49.083
For years while making love

34:49.166 --> 34:51.917
you've started to ask me something
then stopped.

34:52.000 --> 34:55.834
- What are you talking about?
- You are unhappy with our sex life

34:55.917 --> 34:59.625
because you're not getting something
but you're too afraid to ask.

34:59.709 --> 35:03.375
My problem is that you can't stop
thinking about the housework.

35:03.458 --> 35:06.291
Then take me right here, right now.

35:06.375 --> 35:10.166
The house is spotless. There are no
burritos around to pull my focus.

35:10.291 --> 35:13.709
- I'm not in the mood.
- Why not?

35:13.792 --> 35:19.166
We haven't had sex for months. Most men
would be climbing the walls by now.

35:19.291 --> 35:23.500
- Please don't do this.
- Rex, whatever you want.

35:23.625 --> 35:27.792
I will go there with you.
You just have to say it out loud.

35:27.917 --> 35:31.083
Tell me. What do you want?
What do you need?

35:31.166 --> 35:34.458
For you to stop talking like this.
You sound like a whore.

35:34.542 --> 35:37.709
No, I sound like a woman
whose husband won't touch her.

35:45.333 --> 35:50.625
Rex, after Mary Alice killed herself,
it all hit me.

35:50.750 --> 35:54.333
We all have our secrets. I think
it's time for you to tell me yours.

36:06.959 --> 36:09.291
I'm going.

36:21.583 --> 36:27.083
<i>That night, while most</i>
<i>of Wisteria Lane dreamt the night away,</i>

36:27.166 --> 36:31.458
<i>Lynette was in the middle</i>
<i>of her own personal nightmare.</i>

36:31.542 --> 36:36.375
<i>Determined her boys</i>
<i>would not miss their fairy-tale debut,</i>

36:36.500 --> 36:40.542
<i>Lynette had stayed up</i>
<i>18 hours straight, sewing.</i>

36:42.625 --> 36:46.583
<i>But she began to fear her story</i>
<i>would not have a happy ending.</i>

36:52.792 --> 36:57.792
<i>Luckily for Lynette,</i>
<i>she had a magic potion handy.</i>

37:00.834 --> 37:03.542
<i>And once she had taken it...</i>

37:07.375 --> 37:10.458
<i>the magic kept working...</i>

37:13.291 --> 37:16.458
<i>and working...</i>

37:18.750 --> 37:21.417
<i>and working.</i>

37:24.083 --> 37:28.542
<i>It wasn't until noon</i>
<i>that Lynette finally took a break,</i>

37:28.667 --> 37:33.709
<i>and the reality of what she had done</i>
<i>began to sink in.</i>

37:33.834 --> 37:36.542
My. What big eyes you have.

37:42.166 --> 37:45.208
I'm going to the store.
Do you need anything?

37:45.291 --> 37:47.917
I'm fine, thank you.

37:49.417 --> 37:53.083
So what's been going on with her?
Have you found anything out yet?

37:53.166 --> 37:59.750
Actually, the more I watch her, the more
I think she's not stepping out on you.

37:59.834 --> 38:03.959
- Really?
- Yeah. She's not perfect, Lord knows.

38:04.041 --> 38:07.458
But she loves you. I can tell.

38:09.625 --> 38:13.542
Mama. You don't know what a relief it is
to hear that.

38:15.959 --> 38:19.542
You know, it's funny.
I really think she loves you, too.

38:23.792 --> 38:27.709
I got concerned when I heard
you played poker with her friends.

38:28.959 --> 38:31.959
So I told her about your little problem.

38:34.667 --> 38:37.542
You told her about my gambling problem?

38:37.667 --> 38:41.333
Don't be mad. I just didn't want you
slipping into old habits.

38:41.417 --> 38:46.000
- She was very concerned about you.
- She knew?

38:50.834 --> 38:56.458
I don't get it. You and Zach never
went to school with anybody named Dana.

38:56.542 --> 38:58.500
He didn't say she was at school.

38:58.583 --> 39:02.917
- Did it sound like a relative?
- It sounded like "Dana".

39:03.041 --> 39:06.041
Unless he was using a code,
that's all I got.

39:06.125 --> 39:10.291
OK, give me a break here.
I'm just grasping at straws.

39:10.375 --> 39:15.917
I'm sorry. I'm worried about Zach.
It's really creepy in there.

39:16.000 --> 39:19.583
- Can't we get him out?
- Honey, that's up to his father.

39:21.583 --> 39:25.291
- Then I want to visit again.
- That's not a good idea either.

39:25.375 --> 39:27.792
Why?

39:29.875 --> 39:32.583
I just have a feeling.

39:42.417 --> 39:44.709
<i>Juanita was now</i>
<i>more convinced than ever</i>

39:44.792 --> 39:48.291
<i>that her treacherous</i>
<i>daughter-in-law was having an affair.</i>

39:48.375 --> 39:51.959
<i>But the question remained, with whom?</i>

40:05.750 --> 40:08.500
<i>And suddenly...</i>

40:09.583 --> 40:13.083
<i>Juanita remembered</i>
<i>it wasn't the men Gabrielle talked to</i>

40:13.208 --> 40:15.291
<i>that she had to worry about.</i>

40:20.667 --> 40:25.583
Hey, Jordana, Maisy.
Here are the costumes. Right on time.

40:25.667 --> 40:28.291
Thank you, Lynette.

40:31.083 --> 40:35.583
This is a bit awkward. There has been
an oversight with the programs.

40:35.667 --> 40:39.000
Celia Bond is still credited
with costumes.

40:39.125 --> 40:42.166
They forgot to tell the printer.

40:44.333 --> 40:49.125
Who is "they", as in,
"they forgot to tell the printer"?

40:50.792 --> 40:54.792
That would be me. I'm sorry.

40:54.875 --> 40:59.709
But I was so overworked this week with
all the script changes you demanded.

40:59.834 --> 41:01.917
Well, these things happen.

41:04.625 --> 41:06.583
Be right back.

41:08.041 --> 41:11.417
Would you do something with this?
It looks like road kill.

41:14.458 --> 41:16.834
OK, lady, that's it.

41:18.709 --> 41:21.250
- I beg your pardon?
- We have kids the same age.

41:21.333 --> 41:24.583
There are years ahead of us
having to deal with each other.

41:24.667 --> 41:28.750
So instead of playing petty games, why
don't we put an end to this right now?

41:28.834 --> 41:32.709
- What are you saying?
- Let's take it outside.

41:32.792 --> 41:36.333
- Let's take what outside?
- Your sorry ass. We're throwin' down.

41:36.417 --> 41:39.250
- You are crazy.
- Just being practical.

41:39.333 --> 41:41.125
Isn't it better to settle this

41:41.208 --> 41:46.166
rather than endure all this
alpha-mom crap until our kids graduate?

41:46.250 --> 41:49.375
Come on.
I'll even let you take the first shot.

41:59.792 --> 42:02.834
- I don't have time for this.
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

42:02.917 --> 42:06.625
And just so you know,
next spring, when we do <i>Bambi,</i>

42:06.709 --> 42:11.375
his mother's gonna take a slug
to the heart and you're gonna like it.

42:19.917 --> 42:23.709
<i>The search for power begins</i>
<i>when we're quite young.</i>

42:23.792 --> 42:30.000
<i>As children, we're taught that the power</i>
<i>of good triumphs over the power of evil.</i>

42:30.083 --> 42:36.583
<i>But as we get older, we realize</i>
<i>that nothing is ever that simple.</i>

42:36.709 --> 42:40.500
<i>Traces of evil always remain.</i>
