00:02.202 --> 00:05.638
<i>[J.D.] Turk and Carla were converting</i>
<i>my old bedroom into a nursery,</i>

00:05.705 --> 00:07.969
<i>so I helped paint a mural</i>
<i>for the new baby.</i>

00:08.808 --> 00:10.969
- Done.
- [Carla] Oh, hell no!

00:11.044 --> 00:14.502
Is that big, ugly one
shooting laser beams into the crib?

00:14.581 --> 00:15.946
That's Optimus Prime.

00:16.015 --> 00:19.281
I don't think he'd appreciate
you calling him the big, ugly one.

00:19.352 --> 00:20.649
- No, he wouldn't.
- No.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.880
Not Optimus.

00:21.955 --> 00:25.391
If Junior gets scared,
he can always climb into bed with us.

00:25.458 --> 00:28.586
- That's what I did with my mom.
- What do you mean "did"?

00:28.661 --> 00:32.756
Last Christmas, I walked in on Turk
and his mom cuddling together in bed.

00:32.832 --> 00:35.699
<i>[J.D.] Turk gets defensive</i>
<i>when it comes to his mother.</i>

00:35.769 --> 00:37.862
You're jealous 'cause your mom's dead.

00:37.937 --> 00:40.633
Whoa! We should probably take a break.

00:40.707 --> 00:43.574
You'll finish building that crib
like you promised.

00:43.643 --> 00:47.409
You are driving to the cemetery,
cleaning up my mom's grave,

00:47.480 --> 00:49.641
and asking her for forgiveness.

00:49.749 --> 00:52.309
I hate having to ask for forgiveness.

00:55.855 --> 00:57.117
How's my mom doing?

00:57.190 --> 01:00.057
I asked if she still hated me
and the sprinklers came on.

01:00.126 --> 01:03.653
Give her time.
She's only been dead for three years.

01:03.730 --> 01:06.824
But, baby, it's too soon
to be putting a nursery together,

01:06.900 --> 01:11.234
test driving minivans,
or buying baby monitors.

01:11.304 --> 01:13.795
<i>[J.D. Over monitor]</i>
<i>I can't get this crib together.</i>

01:13.873 --> 01:17.036
<i>And can somebody please</i>
<i>bring me a glass of water?</i>

01:17.544 --> 01:19.205
You go this time.

01:20.780 --> 01:22.247
Thank you.

01:22.315 --> 01:25.011
<i>[J.D.] Thinking about Turk and Carla</i>
<i>becoming parents</i>

01:25.085 --> 01:28.054
<i>made me think of my mom</i>
<i>and how much she probably misses me.</i>

01:28.121 --> 01:32.353
<i>I bet she wishes she could see what life</i>
<i>is like around here through my eyes.</i>

01:33.560 --> 01:37.121
<i>And that's why I strapped</i>
<i>my video camera to my head.</i>

01:37.197 --> 01:38.960
- Morning, weirdo.
- Lonnie.

01:39.032 --> 01:42.798
<i>[J.D.] It was the perfect idea.</i>
<i>She got to meet my superiors.</i>

01:45.205 --> 01:48.971
That's right, the old man
stole some ice cream.

01:49.075 --> 01:51.566
<i>[J.D.] I even got some great footage</i>
<i>of Dr. Cox.</i>

01:51.644 --> 01:55.307
- Where the hell have you been?
- I'm making a video postcard.

01:55.381 --> 01:58.111
- Do you have a message for my mom?
- No.

01:58.184 --> 02:00.414
But since she brought you
into the world,

02:00.487 --> 02:02.614
I do have a message for her uterus.

02:02.689 --> 02:05.214
Bad uterus!
Don't do that anymore.

02:05.291 --> 02:09.193
She had a hysterectomy, but I'm sure
I can just edit over that part.

02:09.262 --> 02:10.752
Let's go see Mr. McNair.

02:10.830 --> 02:12.957
<i>[J.D.] Mr. McNair</i>
<i>had locked-in syndrome,</i>

02:13.032 --> 02:15.592
<i>a paralysis so severe</i>
<i>he could only communicate</i>

02:15.702 --> 02:18.671
<i>through a computer</i>
<i>that responds to his eye movements.</i>

02:18.738 --> 02:20.501
Check his vitals, Eva.

02:20.573 --> 02:23.736
<i>[Computer] Why does he</i>
<i>call you a girl's name?</i>

02:23.810 --> 02:25.675
Thank you for asking, Mr. McNair.

02:25.745 --> 02:29.203
You see, the thing about Dr. Cox
is the closer he feels to a person,

02:29.282 --> 02:31.250
the more he needs to push them away.

02:31.317 --> 02:35.617
When he calls me Eva, he's actually
saying, "J.D., I care about you."

02:35.688 --> 02:40.625
- Vulnerable people like...
<i>- [computer] Oh, my God. I get it now.</i>

02:40.693 --> 02:43.423
<i>Carol. Carol, Carol, Carol, Carol...</i>

02:43.496 --> 02:45.464
- Now you're being a jerk.
<i>- Carol...</i>

02:45.565 --> 02:47.897
- Jerk! Jerk! Jerk!
<i>- Carol, Carol, Carol...</i>

02:47.967 --> 02:48.934
- Newbie!
- What?

02:49.035 --> 02:51.595
I'm relatively certain
the computer is broken.

02:51.704 --> 02:54.070
<i>- Carol, Carol, Carol...</i>
- My bad.

02:54.974 --> 02:58.137
<i>[J.D.] I felt bad for Mr. McNair,</i>
<i>but I was off until six tonight,</i>

02:58.211 --> 03:02.045
<i>so I decided to grab</i>
<i>a quick nap in the sun.</i>

03:09.022 --> 03:11.889
[J.D.] What the...? Ah!

03:11.958 --> 03:15.325
# <i>I can't do this all on my own</i>

03:15.428 --> 03:18.795
# <i>No, I know</i>
<i>I'm no Superman</i>

03:22.268 --> 03:23.963
# <i>I'm no Superman</i> #

03:26.906 --> 03:30.273
- [Turk] Where the hell is J.D.?
- [Carla] He's off until six.

03:30.376 --> 03:34.642
Any second now, he's gonna walk
through that door, lost in his thoughts.

03:36.282 --> 03:39.911
<i>[Janitor] With Dorian taken care of,</i>
<i>I'm not sure how I should spend my day.</i>

03:39.986 --> 03:43.080
<i>I suppose I could clean.</i>
<i>[Laughs]</i>

03:43.156 --> 03:45.488
<i>God help me,</i>
<i>that one still makes me laugh.</i>

03:45.558 --> 03:48.994
<i>Oh, no, it's black Kojak</i>
<i>and Scary Nurse-Wife.</i>

03:49.062 --> 03:52.190
<i>I'll get rid of them</i>
<i>with an innocuous compliment.</i>

03:52.265 --> 03:54.324
You are glowing.

03:55.802 --> 03:57.429
<i>[Janitor] Free and clear.</i>

03:57.503 --> 03:59.664
Have you seen J.D.?

04:02.675 --> 04:05.439
Where am I?

04:06.546 --> 04:08.173
Hello?

04:08.748 --> 04:10.511
Anyone?

04:11.484 --> 04:13.509
No, I don't know where he is.

04:13.586 --> 04:17.249
<i>[Janitor] I love that adrenaline rush</i>
<i>you get from lying to someone's face.</i>

04:17.322 --> 04:18.290
<i>Do it again.</i>

04:18.391 --> 04:20.255
Dr. Kelso,

04:20.326 --> 04:24.285
I must say that your nose hair is not
long and creepy like most old guys.

04:24.364 --> 04:25.922
Thank you.

04:27.267 --> 04:30.134
Hey, Perry, great shirt!

04:30.503 --> 04:34.564
Wish I'd thought of athletic apparel
when going through my midlife crisis.

04:34.641 --> 04:38.008
It'd have been cheaper than a
cigarette boat named <i>Dr. Feelgood.</i>

04:40.413 --> 04:44.179
That laughing had better not be aimed
in my direction, bro.

04:44.284 --> 04:49.187
Bro? Dude, bros don't even use "bro."
You're not as hip as you think you are.

04:49.255 --> 04:50.916
And you are?

04:51.157 --> 04:52.715
I'm black.

04:52.825 --> 04:55.316
God knew my people
would go through struggles,

04:55.395 --> 04:57.829
so he gave us a lifetime supply of cool.

04:57.897 --> 05:01.162
Like he knew white people
would be rhythmically challenged

05:01.234 --> 05:02.667
and he gave you this dance.

05:04.771 --> 05:06.204
You're black?

05:06.272 --> 05:09.571
'Cause, last I checked,
you had a nerdy white best friend,

05:09.642 --> 05:11.303
you enjoy Neil Diamond,

05:11.377 --> 05:13.607
and you damn sure act
like a black guy.

05:13.680 --> 05:18.049
And these, my friend,
are all characteristics of white guys.

05:18.151 --> 05:21.882
Now, please understand,
I'm a huge supporter of the NAACP.

05:21.954 --> 05:26.220
That stands for the National Association
For The Advancement Of Colored People.

05:26.292 --> 05:30.388
And quite frankly, I always thought
they should change "Colored People"

05:30.463 --> 05:31.760
to "African-Americans."

05:31.831 --> 05:34.994
But then it wouldn't be the NAACP,

05:35.068 --> 05:37.832
it would be the "N quad A,"
or NAAAA.

05:37.937 --> 05:40.997
I know this probably sounds
like a digression,

05:41.074 --> 05:43.804
but it actually leads me
back to my original point:

05:43.876 --> 05:46.003
Do I think you're black?

05:46.579 --> 05:49.139
Nah.

05:51.918 --> 05:53.146
Knock, knock.

05:53.219 --> 05:55.187
<i>[Janitor] Who's there?</i>
<i>Nurse Mophead.</i>

05:55.288 --> 05:58.451
<i>Nurse Mophead, who?</i>
<i>You have a mophead.</i>

05:58.558 --> 06:01.118
Well, your new computer
should be here tonight.

06:02.395 --> 06:04.955
She got out of here in a hurry,
didn't she?

06:05.064 --> 06:07.897
I know what that's like,
when people say the minimum.

06:07.967 --> 06:11.095
But with me it's usually,
"Mop that floor. Clean that counter.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.229
Stop provoking that bear."

06:13.306 --> 06:14.796
Want me to keep you company?

06:14.874 --> 06:17.707
I don't mind. I'm just working
on my own stuff anyway.

06:17.777 --> 06:20.871
I'm a bit of an inventor.
I'm gonna show you my latest one:

06:21.214 --> 06:22.681
Pen straw.

06:26.953 --> 06:28.386
Perfect. Ahem!

06:28.454 --> 06:30.718
Except I don't like that cola.

06:30.790 --> 06:32.951
It tastes like ink. [sighs]

06:33.025 --> 06:35.789
But that's just one.
I got a million ideas.

06:37.230 --> 06:41.792
I don't care if he is on the first
floor, I need this cleaned up now!

06:42.969 --> 06:44.937
I'm here. Open up the window.

06:45.004 --> 06:46.972
That was quick.

06:48.274 --> 06:49.639
I call it the Hover Hoover.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.108
Where suction meets the sky.

06:52.578 --> 06:56.241
That's a good question. Only problem
is I've answered it five times.

06:56.315 --> 06:58.613
Dr. Reid, would you mind
explaining to me

06:58.684 --> 07:00.549
why you called the chief of surgery

07:00.620 --> 07:03.145
to consult on a cellulitis patient
yesterday?

07:03.222 --> 07:05.588
I wasn't even here yesterday.

07:05.658 --> 07:08.559
Your interns were.
Their mistakes are your mistakes.

07:08.628 --> 07:12.359
Whether it's an unnecessary consult,
or his ridiculous haircut.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.093
This cost $60.

07:14.167 --> 07:17.432
Let's hope your stylist
put that money towards rehab.

07:17.637 --> 07:20.606
Darn it. I'm sick and tired
of your careless mistakes.

07:20.706 --> 07:22.674
Why isn't this bleeder on telemetry?

07:22.775 --> 07:24.936
I know you had a 12-hour
shift yesterday,

07:25.011 --> 07:27.980
but that is no excuse for not
turning in your histories.

07:28.047 --> 07:31.278
You dragged me to dinner
and made me play <i>Scrabble</i> all night.

07:31.350 --> 07:34.615
How you spend your private life
isn't my responsibility, OK?

07:34.687 --> 07:36.655
Fine. I'll do them tonight.

07:36.756 --> 07:39.418
You're taking me to the movies.
Get on the ball.

07:39.492 --> 07:41.653
All of you, go work.

07:42.028 --> 07:43.996
Wow.

07:44.063 --> 07:46.531
Aren't you the big badass attending?

07:46.599 --> 07:50.035
It's time for them to sink or swim.
I got to where I am on my own, OK?

07:50.102 --> 07:52.263
Nobody helped you out in the beginning?

07:52.338 --> 07:55.796
Dr. Cox was my attending. He kept
track of the times he made me cry.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.435
Twenty-seven, counting this morning.

07:58.544 --> 08:02.071
Yeah, I'm PMS'ing
and he made fun of my shoes.

08:03.683 --> 08:05.742
Laverne, what are you doing out here?

08:05.818 --> 08:08.343
Tonight's date night with Mr. Roberts

08:08.421 --> 08:12.585
and I like to prime the pump
by watching the young men sweat.

08:12.658 --> 08:15.991
Hey, Dr. Cox, if I wasn't a black man,
could I do this?

08:17.630 --> 08:19.928
That's game, all right!
That's game!

08:19.999 --> 08:22.092
- You got next?
- Yeah, I got next.

08:22.168 --> 08:25.399
They call me the Candyman
'cause my moves are so sweet.

08:25.471 --> 08:29.567
They call me The Pig, because I say
sexist and derogatory things to women.

08:29.642 --> 08:32.202
Lonnie, play with Dr. Cox.

08:33.379 --> 08:34.869
Let's go!

08:34.947 --> 08:37.677
- [Turk laughing]
- Ooh! Ooh!

08:37.750 --> 08:41.116
[Turk laughing] Look at the glasses!
Look at the mouthpiece!

08:41.187 --> 08:45.283
Dr. Turk is not aware that Lonnie
was all-conference at Villanova.

08:45.358 --> 08:48.418
Would you go ahead
and thank what's-his-name for me?

08:48.494 --> 08:50.359
- Jesus?
- That's him.

08:50.429 --> 08:52.090
- Let's go.
- Take ball.

08:56.135 --> 09:00.469
Lisa, why did you order
100 units of insulin for Mrs. Best?

09:00.540 --> 09:03.907
No, that's only 10 units.
I put a smiley face after the zero.

09:04.010 --> 09:08.640
Look, Lisa, you have to be crystal
clear with your medication orders.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.581
<i>- [Beeping]</i>
- OK, it's causing a bit of a seizure.

09:11.651 --> 09:13.209
Hey, Janitor!

09:13.286 --> 09:15.720
Come here!
Hold her legs down, please!

09:15.788 --> 09:18.689
<i>[Janitor] This is it!</i>
<i>I'm in the show! Dr. Jan-itor.</i>

09:18.758 --> 09:22.125
We'll give her an amp of B50.

09:22.194 --> 09:25.129
This is easy.
Just like drowning someone.

09:25.197 --> 09:26.357
<i>[Beeping stops]</i>

09:26.465 --> 09:29.525
OK. You can let her legs go now.
I think we're good.

09:29.602 --> 09:31.900
I didn't see the demon leave the body.

09:32.171 --> 09:34.196
I'm sure it did.

09:34.273 --> 09:36.798
Hey, Janitor, good job.

09:38.744 --> 09:40.109
Good job.

09:42.214 --> 09:45.183
Dr. Reid will kill me
when she finds out about this.

09:45.284 --> 09:49.050
Relax. I'll go talk to Dr. Reid.
It won't be a big deal.

09:49.155 --> 09:50.122
What?!

09:50.222 --> 09:53.988
I'm gonna make someone burn for this.
Who did it, Carla?

09:56.062 --> 09:59.122
I didn't realize how much I picked up
from working here.

09:59.198 --> 10:03.862
I heard her yell, "Hold this woman's
legs down," and I just knew what to do.

10:03.936 --> 10:05.699
Good for you.

10:05.805 --> 10:09.502
Now I've got to go meet my husband
at the bus station

10:09.575 --> 10:11.736
and pretend to be a street walker.

10:12.111 --> 10:13.476
Enjoy your date night.

10:13.546 --> 10:16.379
<i>[Janitor] OK, Mr. Cool Guy,</i>
<i>you had your moment of glory.</i>

10:16.449 --> 10:18.940
<i>No need to make a big deal out of it.</i>

10:19.018 --> 10:20.542
Hey!

10:20.620 --> 10:23.384
Slow down, buddy.
What's the hurry? Come here!

10:23.456 --> 10:26.584
I want to tell you
a little story about a hero.

10:26.659 --> 10:30.561
<i>[Janitor] Know what? The hell with it.</i>
<i>It feels good to get a little attention.</i>

10:31.964 --> 10:35.627
<i>I'll tell you one thing,</i>
<i>it beats falling flat on your ass.</i>

10:37.069 --> 10:38.331
Holy moly!

10:38.404 --> 10:41.771
That would've been really embarrassing
if you were black.

10:42.608 --> 10:44.235
Great.

10:44.310 --> 10:48.144
Seriously, Carla, I need to know
who's responsible for this.

10:48.214 --> 10:50.648
<i>[Janitor] Or lying</i>
<i>to cover someone's ass.</i>

10:50.716 --> 10:52.479
I don't know.

10:52.585 --> 10:56.316
It was just a clerical error.
There's no way to trace it.

10:56.389 --> 10:59.847
Was I brave?
"Brave" is a pretty strong word.

10:59.925 --> 11:03.486
Perhaps the better term is "valiant."

Hey, Jill.

Hey, Jill.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.577
Yep, a lot of lives would change.

11:53.646 --> 11:55.773
I am gonna prove that to them right now.

11:55.848 --> 11:58.180
I am gonna fix your computer.

11:58.250 --> 12:02.744
I just gotta get my real tools.
I've turned these into eating utensils.

12:02.822 --> 12:04.722
Dig in.

- Oh, thank goodness.

12:11.731 --> 12:15.633
- I thought I was running late.
<i>- [Janitor] I do love to lie.</i>

12:15.701 --> 12:18.761
Look at my face. Keith, what
does it mean when I'm frowning?

12:18.838 --> 12:22.899
You're feeling insecure and suspicious
that I think someone on television

12:22.975 --> 12:24.306
is prettier than you.

12:24.376 --> 12:25.741
At work, Keith.

12:25.845 --> 12:27.608
Ah...

12:27.680 --> 12:31.172
Keith was half right.
This face means that I am suspicious.

12:31.250 --> 12:32.615
I was reviewing records.

12:32.685 --> 12:35.654
Mrs. Best received
an inordinate amount of insulin.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.724
- I wanna know who screwed up.
- [Carla] Elliot?

12:40.359 --> 12:43.817
You're wasting your time.
You know how interns stick together.

12:43.896 --> 12:48.833
- They'll never rat each other out.
- I am sleeping with one of the interns.

12:48.901 --> 12:54.066
Seeing as I've gotten Keith to pee
sitting down so there's no splatter,

12:54.173 --> 12:56.505
I'm betting I'll be able
to get him to talk.

12:56.842 --> 12:58.070
Keith!

12:58.744 --> 13:01.679
Meet me in the caf in half an hour.

13:02.348 --> 13:05.181
Keith, you better not
tell her who did it.

13:05.251 --> 13:06.809
But Elliot scares me.

13:06.886 --> 13:11.255
Elliot is a blonde, 108-pound ski pole
from a cul-de-sac in Connecticut.

13:11.323 --> 13:14.622
I am an underpaid pregnant nurse
from the block,

13:14.693 --> 13:18.060
who, over the next six months,
will become fatter and angrier.

13:18.130 --> 13:21.065
- Now, who are you really afraid of?
- The fatty.

13:21.133 --> 13:22.862
Be careful, Keith.

13:25.137 --> 13:26.900
Oh, I love it!

13:26.972 --> 13:30.430
And you know, they say it's
the safest thing we can do for our baby.

13:30.509 --> 13:32.636
- Can we get it?
- No, no, no.

13:32.711 --> 13:38.206
Let's take it back before somebody
sees me. As a matter of fact, get down!

[Honks]

13:48.494 --> 13:50.985
Hate to bother you,
but could you explain again,

13:51.063 --> 13:53.554
what's it like to be a young,
hip black guy?

13:53.632 --> 13:57.193
You see, Dr. Cox, what I'm gonna do
is we're gonna pimp this out.

13:57.303 --> 14:01.569
We're gonna throw some 22s on it,
put some spinners on the 22s...

14:01.640 --> 14:05.269
Ooh! And a DVD player
so the kids can watch Elmo.

14:05.344 --> 14:06.572
You're killing me.

<i>[Janitor] Sometimes, around here,</i>
<i>it feels like humiliation is contagious.</i>

Mr. McNair,
I didn't exactly fix your computer.

14:17.489 --> 14:20.151
I think I might have voided
your warranty.

14:20.226 --> 14:23.389
Elliot, I am not gonna tell you
who messed up with Mrs. Best.

14:23.462 --> 14:26.431
Oh, no problem.
I just wanted to grab a cup of coffee.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.023
Oh, and introduce you to my mom.

14:29.101 --> 14:32.468
[Laughs] Mom.
That makes me sound so old.

14:32.571 --> 14:36.940
I had C-sections with all my kids,
so everything is as it was down there.

14:37.009 --> 14:39.739
Uh, very nice to meet you, Mrs. Reid.

14:39.812 --> 14:42.246
You and Elliot
would have such cute babies.

14:42.314 --> 14:45.283
She's only got about
five more years to pop one out.

14:45.384 --> 14:48.046
- Have you ever seen chubby Elliot?
- Uh, no.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.055
If you want to see it,
break up and wait a couple of weeks.

14:51.123 --> 14:54.854
When she's depressed, she hits
a bag of Doritos like there's diamonds.

14:54.927 --> 14:57.088
- Love you too, Mom.
<i>- [Phone rings]</i>

14:57.162 --> 15:00.689
Ah! That's your dad.
How did you get this number?

15:01.634 --> 15:04.467
Like her? If you don't tell me
which intern messed up,

15:04.536 --> 15:06.163
I'll beg her to move here.

15:06.238 --> 15:10.607
She's just a little weird, Elliot.
I can handle weird.

15:13.012 --> 15:13.979
I'm sorry.

15:14.079 --> 15:17.981
The light just hit you so perfectly,
I had to have a taste.

15:18.050 --> 15:20.280
- No, not you.
- It was Lisa.

15:20.352 --> 15:23.446
I would have told you earlier,
but someone told me not to.

15:23.522 --> 15:25.387
Who told you not to?

15:25.758 --> 15:30.127
Baby, you're not really bothered
by what Dr. Cox said, are you?

15:30.229 --> 15:32.891
- You know you're my black prince.
- That's not it.

15:32.965 --> 15:35.126
I know I'm black.
I'm reminded all the time.

15:35.234 --> 15:36.997
Patient doesn't want a black doctor,

15:37.102 --> 15:39.400
people think I know the score
to every NBA game,

15:39.471 --> 15:41.371
and I told you what happened last week

15:41.440 --> 15:44.068
when the new board member
met the surgical staff.

15:44.143 --> 15:45.667
Nice to meet you.

15:45.744 --> 15:47.473
Nice to meet you.

15:47.546 --> 15:49.514
Nice to meet you.

15:49.581 --> 15:51.481
Hey, what's up, dawg?

15:52.451 --> 15:53.918
Nice to meet you.

15:54.720 --> 15:56.813
It's not even about that.

15:57.556 --> 16:02.084
It's about the nursery.
It's about that stupid minivan.

16:02.161 --> 16:06.029
I don't know if you know this, but
overnight I went from Chris Turk, Stud,

16:06.098 --> 16:08.328
to Grandpa Turk,
the guy who wears overalls

16:08.400 --> 16:10.630
and does embarrassing dances
at cookouts.

16:10.703 --> 16:13.638
You do that now.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.408
But in a cool way.

16:17.509 --> 16:21.275
Hey. Thanks to your little
telling-me-the wrong-time prank,

16:21.380 --> 16:24.144
I was 45 minutes late
for my Oriental massage.

16:24.249 --> 16:28.185
Which meant that instead of Pang-Wa,
I had to settle for Ching-Lau.

16:28.253 --> 16:31.780
- So?
- Ching-Lau is a dude!

16:31.857 --> 16:36.226
You know, I've accepted the fact
that you're useless around here.

16:36.295 --> 16:40.061
Maybe you could just try a little
harder not to make things worse.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.532
Know what he doesn't get?
I could have been a janitor anywhere.

16:43.635 --> 16:47.594
When I got out of college, I had offers.
Morgan-Stanley, Dupont...

16:47.706 --> 16:51.608
I even considered taking a year off
and cleaning my way across Europe.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.304
But no, I chose a hospital.

16:53.779 --> 16:57.476
I'm not kidding myself. I don't have
the most important job in the world,

16:57.549 --> 17:01.110
but I work in a place that helps people,
and I thought I was part of that.

17:02.388 --> 17:03.946
Who cares.

17:08.794 --> 17:10.625
- Have you seen Carla?
- [Cox] Nope.

17:10.695 --> 17:14.826
My turn. Have you seen how stupid you
look when you do your angry quick-walk?

17:22.808 --> 17:26.574
Carla covered for one of my interns
and then lied to my face about it.

17:27.146 --> 17:29.410
Come on. Of course she did.

17:29.481 --> 17:33.781
If an intern got hammered and stripped
of what little self-confidence they have

17:33.852 --> 17:36.912
every time they messed up,
there wouldn't be any left.

17:36.989 --> 17:39.753
Luckily, Carla happens
to have been here long enough

17:39.825 --> 17:42.555
to identify when someone
needs to be protected.

17:42.628 --> 17:45.995
- These kids need to stand on their...
- Got that right, sister.

17:46.065 --> 17:49.034
Because you definitely
got where you are on your own.

17:49.134 --> 17:53.400
- You sure didn't give me any help.
- I didn't say I did.

18:03.715 --> 18:05.649
[Carla] It's OK.
It's not a big deal.

18:05.717 --> 18:09.676
- But Dr. Cox is gonna kill me.
- Dr. Cox doesn't have to find out.

18:09.788 --> 18:12.757
Just promise you'll practice
repositioning the swans.

18:12.858 --> 18:14.758
- I promise.
- OK.

18:19.331 --> 18:22.823
Turk, I get it.

18:22.901 --> 18:25.426
Having a baby changes things.

18:25.504 --> 18:28.598
I just don't want to say goodbye
to the life we have now.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.301
Well, baby, you don't have to.

18:30.375 --> 18:33.538
We'll still have fun,
go to bars, go dancing...

18:33.645 --> 18:35.203
- Really?
- No.

18:35.314 --> 18:38.374
We'll have a baby.
That would be crazy.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.145
Just focus on the positives.

18:40.219 --> 18:43.586
For instance,
we'll still have lots of sex.

18:43.689 --> 18:45.418
- Really?
- No!

18:45.491 --> 18:49.860
But I can tell you that this is normal.

18:49.928 --> 18:51.691
You'll get through it.

18:54.533 --> 18:58.993
Come to think of it, what would
really help me get through it...

I hope you don't mind me
hanging out all day talking to you.

19:19.391 --> 19:22.758
I don't think you do mind.
I got a seventh sense about that.

19:22.828 --> 19:25.797
My sixth sense is I can tell
when squirrels are afraid.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.964
Anyway, I know you lost your computer

19:29.034 --> 19:32.561
and I thought maybe you
were a little bit Ionely.

19:32.638 --> 19:35.664
I've been Ionely around here
a couple times.

19:36.475 --> 19:39.035
I don't know. I just hope I helped.

19:40.078 --> 19:43.047
Nobody's buying it.
Your new computer is finally here.

19:43.115 --> 19:44.412
