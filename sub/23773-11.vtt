01:06.280 --> 01:08.160
FILM 11

01:08.720 --> 01:11.520
<i>Killing is like giving birth to a child.</i>

01:11.600 --> 01:14.120
<i>I am the father and the mother.</i>

01:14.200 --> 01:16.600
<i>I open the door to another world.</i>

01:17.640 --> 01:19.880
<i>I give new life.</i>

01:37.760 --> 01:45.640
ZASLAVSK / SCHOOL No. 23

02:09.840 --> 02:12.200
You’re late. The bell’s already rung.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.160
-The guitar is heavy. It slowed me up.
-Do you play that?

02:15.240 --> 02:17.680
Of course.
They asked me to play for Teachers’ Day.

02:17.760 --> 02:20.440
-We have a rehearsal today.
-Then hurry up, artist.

02:32.800 --> 02:34.800
PHYSICS

02:42.600 --> 02:43.800
E

02:44.600 --> 02:45.680
equals

02:46.320 --> 02:48.200
mc…

02:50.200 --> 02:51.120
squared.

02:55.880 --> 02:58.000
On top of being a lazy student,

02:58.680 --> 03:00.680
now you can’t even wake up on time?

03:00.760 --> 03:01.760
I’m sorry.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.360
Aren’t you in the wrong place, my friend?

03:09.840 --> 03:11.840
This is a physics class, mind you.

03:12.440 --> 03:13.840
Music is on the third floor.

03:39.160 --> 03:40.160
POLICE

03:40.240 --> 03:42.640
-Get us away from here! Please!
-Save me! Help!

03:42.720 --> 03:46.000
-My daughter’s there! Do you understand?
-Calm down. We’re working on it.

03:49.360 --> 03:50.520
Hurry up, come on!

03:51.400 --> 03:53.800
-Let us through.
-No cameras allowed.

04:00.200 --> 04:01.560
Make way!

04:34.320 --> 04:36.560
Drop your weapon! Hands behind your head!

04:38.600 --> 04:41.200
I will only speak to Major Meglin.

04:52.440 --> 04:53.960
<i>Do you feel it?</i>

04:55.480 --> 04:56.880
<i>I love you.</i> Esenya Andreyevna…

05:18.720 --> 05:20.120
so far,

05:21.040 --> 05:25.480
we have only discussed,
let’s call them, Meglin’s successes--

05:26.960 --> 05:29.680
the cases he solved,
the criminals he caught.

05:30.880 --> 05:34.760
But sometimes,
the killers managed to escape Meglin.

05:36.280 --> 05:37.960
Let’s talk about his failures.

05:38.960 --> 05:41.360
I don’t say Meglin is perfect,

05:41.440 --> 05:44.440
but he never failed
and he always saw his cases through.

05:49.400 --> 05:50.720
Fine.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.000
Then let’s say he was…

05:53.480 --> 05:55.120
a bit slow to respond.

05:55.200 --> 05:56.680
What do you mean?

05:57.240 --> 06:01.600
Would you call Meglin a gambler?

06:02.440 --> 06:03.600
Are you serious?

06:05.240 --> 06:07.760
Do you really think
he could play with them?

06:07.840 --> 06:09.960
Well, we want to figure that out.

06:14.520 --> 06:15.720
<i>One more thing.</i>

06:15.800 --> 06:18.640
<i>The guy was in touch</i>
<i>with all sorts of marginals on the Web.</i>

06:18.720 --> 06:20.320
<i>Do you remember the Saturday killer?</i>

06:21.160 --> 06:22.720
<i>Our guy was one of his subscribers.</i>

06:22.800 --> 06:25.480
I haven’t seen the whole exchange yet,

06:25.560 --> 06:28.360
but the guy seems to have been
completely brainwashed.

06:28.440 --> 06:31.880
He was among those who left comments
about the Saturday killer’s manifesto.

06:32.480 --> 06:33.640
<i>Like, “It’s cool.”</i>

06:33.720 --> 06:38.040
<i>Then some troll egged him on.</i>
<i>“I bet you can’t beat this.”</i>

06:38.120 --> 06:39.840
<i>And all hell broke loose.</i>

06:39.920 --> 06:41.120
Thanks, bye.

06:44.800 --> 06:46.040
His name is Nikita.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.760
He’d been seen by a psychologist.

06:49.520 --> 06:51.320
His father was a hunter and had a rifle.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.000
His parents were found in their apartment.

06:54.080 --> 06:56.080
Nikita shot them that morning.

06:56.160 --> 06:58.000
A special forces team is on site now.

06:58.760 --> 06:59.880
Then he went to school.

06:59.960 --> 07:02.720
He shot down a teacher
and five schoolmates.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.800
The kids said he had issues
with the physics teacher.

07:07.120 --> 07:09.120
He was likely to get
a poor grade for the term.

07:10.520 --> 07:13.280
He signed Yashik’s manifesto.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.000
The Sabbatarian?

07:17.080 --> 07:19.680
Yes. They met on the Web.

07:20.280 --> 07:22.720
Before he left,
he poured acid all over his tablet.

07:23.480 --> 07:25.240
Glukhoi located it using his IP.

07:27.040 --> 07:28.240
Has he been interrogated?

07:30.240 --> 07:32.440
He refused to talk to the investigator.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.280
He said he’d only speak to you.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.280
POLICE

07:57.560 --> 07:58.560
Hello.

07:59.320 --> 08:00.880
I was afraid you wouldn’t come.

08:00.960 --> 08:03.520
What made you think it was me you needed?

08:04.480 --> 08:06.520
You’re Meglin. He described you to me.

08:08.120 --> 08:09.400
Go for a walk. Who is he?

08:26.480 --> 08:27.880
Are you prepared to listen?

08:32.919 --> 08:34.240
Let’s have it.

08:39.520 --> 08:40.720
Meglin…

08:41.760 --> 08:46.040
you think you can do everything,
but you can’t do a thing.

08:47.520 --> 08:49.680
You think everything
is under your control…

08:50.880 --> 08:52.320
but it’s me who’s in control.

08:54.640 --> 08:57.120
Instead of looking inside yourself,

08:57.920 --> 09:00.560
you’ve played the wrong card
over and over again.

09:01.400 --> 09:02.880
You’ve betrayed yourself.

09:03.520 --> 09:07.360
I want to show you how pathetic
and helpless the world you created is.

09:08.000 --> 09:09.960
What is this order of yours worth?

09:10.040 --> 09:13.120
Tomorrow, I’ll strike closer to you,
and you’ll be helpless.

09:13.640 --> 09:15.200
You won’t be able to stop me.

09:16.320 --> 09:19.480
You won’t… catch me.

09:23.120 --> 09:24.120
Terrifying.

09:28.640 --> 09:30.400
What was it you fell for?

09:33.160 --> 09:35.280
-Strange.
-What’s strange?

09:35.920 --> 09:37.880
He said you were smarter,
that you understood.

09:37.960 --> 09:38.760
Understood what?

09:39.680 --> 09:40.680
Us!

09:41.280 --> 09:43.080
It was he who opened my eyes.

09:43.160 --> 09:45.600
-I lived in fear my whole life--
-Come on, take him away!

09:45.680 --> 09:47.840
…and he helped me conquer it.

09:47.920 --> 09:51.280
We live in a false, messed-up world
whose laws I reject.

09:51.360 --> 09:55.120
I had to do this to make a statement,
to declare that I exist!

09:55.720 --> 09:58.280
I fear no one! He taught me that!

09:58.360 --> 10:01.080
Not to fear, but to be feared!

10:01.160 --> 10:02.960
And I fear no one!

10:20.200 --> 10:21.200
Did you get it?

10:23.720 --> 10:26.760
<i>You won’t… catch me.</i>

10:52.000 --> 10:54.160
Do you think his threat is real?

10:56.560 --> 10:59.920
I think it’s… fucking real.

11:02.840 --> 11:05.600
He said closer to you. What did he mean?

11:06.120 --> 11:08.320
Not literally closer.

11:08.840 --> 11:10.040
Closer…

11:11.440 --> 11:12.880
meaning more painful.

11:21.120 --> 11:23.120
MILITIA

11:23.200 --> 11:26.280
As I understand it, he saw him
stab his father and mother to death.

11:26.760 --> 11:28.720
-But…
-But what?

11:28.800 --> 11:30.800
When we arrived,

11:30.880 --> 11:34.280
the boy was sitting by his mother’s body
with a knife in his hands.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.360
This one.

11:50.440 --> 11:53.000
-Did he see the murderer?
-It’s Kotov.

11:53.640 --> 11:55.800
Neighbors saw him leaving.

11:58.640 --> 11:59.640
I see.

12:50.600 --> 12:51.800
Have some water.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.000
What’s your name?

13:05.080 --> 13:06.280
Rodion.

13:07.840 --> 13:08.840
Rodion.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.760
What can I say?

13:17.480 --> 13:18.960
A terrible thing happened to you.

13:20.120 --> 13:22.120
I’m sorry for your dad and mom.

13:26.440 --> 13:27.840
But they’re gone.

13:33.880 --> 13:35.600
Tell me what happened.

13:37.960 --> 13:41.080
I was hiding under the bed with the knife.

13:41.760 --> 13:43.320
My dad gave it to me.

13:44.040 --> 13:47.000
That bastard found me and dragged me out.

13:48.560 --> 13:50.080
Mom was still alive.

13:50.160 --> 13:55.320
He said, “Kill her, or I kill you.”

13:56.280 --> 13:58.320
I-- I-- I--

13:58.400 --> 14:01.280
I was scared! I was scared!

14:01.360 --> 14:03.960
She asked me herself!

14:04.040 --> 14:06.000
Rodion. Rodion, calm down.

14:06.600 --> 14:09.280
Your mom wanted to save your life.

14:11.080 --> 14:14.320
You’ll help us… find him.

14:15.400 --> 14:17.000
Sometimes, you have to--

14:17.960 --> 14:21.360
have to surrender now
in order to triumph later.

14:23.040 --> 14:24.560
I’m proud of you.

14:26.160 --> 14:28.040
You’re brave and strong.

14:29.920 --> 14:31.320
And you’re alive.

14:34.320 --> 14:37.800
That’s all your parents wanted.
Understand that, Rodion.

14:48.520 --> 14:49.360
That’s him.

14:56.320 --> 14:57.520
Rodion, we’ll find him.

14:58.520 --> 14:59.960
They’ll execute him.

15:00.040 --> 15:01.280
No.

15:01.360 --> 15:03.000
I want him to suffer.

15:03.920 --> 15:05.320
I want him to die slowly.

15:06.720 --> 15:08.440
I want to kill him myself!

15:18.920 --> 15:20.720
MOSCOW / INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE

15:20.800 --> 15:25.320
<i>An anonymous source at the Ministry says</i>
<i>an accomplice of the criminal is at large,</i>

15:25.400 --> 15:26.920
<i>which means that today’s incident--</i>

15:27.000 --> 15:28.120
-He’s busy!
-I know.

15:28.200 --> 15:31.400
<i>…could be the start of a whole series</i>
<i>of similar crimes.</i>

15:31.480 --> 15:33.880
<i>Law enforcement agencies</i>
<i>could not comment on,</i>

15:33.960 --> 15:35.880
<i>confirm or refute this information,</i>

15:35.960 --> 15:40.720
<i>but we know that all schools in the city</i>
<i>have stepped up security measures.</i>

15:41.760 --> 15:43.360
Where did they get that from?

15:43.440 --> 15:44.400
They pay well.

15:45.480 --> 15:48.520
A nice side income
for some of our officers.

15:52.240 --> 15:54.240
I think it’s no secret to you

15:54.320 --> 15:59.160
that not many higher-ups share the idea
that the end justifies the means.

16:01.480 --> 16:04.320
Another shooting like that
and they’ll bury you.

16:04.400 --> 16:06.920
Then I’m lucky that it won’t happen.

16:07.000 --> 16:09.960
-How can you be so damn sure?
-He’s playing a game.

16:10.040 --> 16:12.880
He won’t repeat his moves.
He always tries something new.

16:12.960 --> 16:16.360
Is that your point?
Should I pass it along?

16:23.840 --> 16:26.160
We took steps on our end.

16:26.880 --> 16:28.640
We stepped up security at schools, sent out extra police patrols.

16:31.800 --> 16:34.600
We’ve mobilized everyone we could.

16:37.440 --> 16:38.640
Any ideas how to catch him?

16:38.720 --> 16:40.680
I have ideas, but they get in the way.

16:40.760 --> 16:41.760
Specifics.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.880
Keep your riddles to yourself.
People’s lives are at stake.

16:44.960 --> 16:47.560
“At stake.” Are you a gambler too?

16:48.680 --> 16:53.280
We believe that the schools are safe.
He knows about the security measures.

16:53.360 --> 16:54.960
He won’t risk it.

16:57.120 --> 17:00.360
Report everything concerning this case
to me immediately.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.440
What are you going to do?

17:04.079 --> 17:06.960
-I’m going home.
-I mean regarding the case!

17:07.040 --> 17:10.319
-I don’t know. We need to wait.
-For what? How long?

17:10.920 --> 17:13.800
Well, until tomorrow,
until he shows himself again.

17:14.480 --> 17:15.720
You mean until he kills?

17:17.599 --> 17:19.520
Are you insane?

17:19.599 --> 17:22.280
I don’t know. Ask Bergich.

17:22.359 --> 17:25.280
Rodion, stop it! What are going to do?

17:26.720 --> 17:28.400
He put this in motion weeks ago.

17:28.480 --> 17:30.640
He holds the trump card.
I have nothing to play with.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.920
Let him play his cards, and we’ll see.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.040
Great.

17:52.440 --> 17:54.440
Here he is!

18:01.960 --> 18:02.840
Hey.

18:02.920 --> 18:04.280
-Hey.
-Hi.

18:04.360 --> 18:06.640
It’s hard to believe,
but I’m not drinking today.

18:06.720 --> 18:09.640
Hard indeed. How come?

18:09.720 --> 18:12.160
I have to be at work at 7:00 tomorrow.

18:13.000 --> 18:15.360
They cracked the whip after the shooting.

18:16.280 --> 18:18.760
We’re going on patrol like ordinary cops.

18:19.480 --> 18:22.760
Zhenya, are you sure
this the place to talk about that?

18:22.840 --> 18:25.280
The whole department’s
been turned inside out.

18:25.360 --> 18:27.000
It’s all over the news.

18:27.080 --> 18:30.360
What, can’t we discuss it together?

18:31.600 --> 18:34.400
That’s the same man who killed Anya,
right?

18:35.080 --> 18:36.120
Not the same.

18:36.680 --> 18:39.360
Prazdnichny killed her,
while this one is, I don’t know… -An instigator, I’d say.
-An instigator.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.120
Shrewd fellow this instigator.

18:48.640 --> 18:49.680
Pour me some.

18:50.320 --> 18:51.960
-Are you sure?
-Yeah.

19:00.280 --> 19:01.280
Listen…

19:03.080 --> 19:05.640
is it true
that he leaves messages for Meglin?

19:07.360 --> 19:08.240
Yes.

19:08.320 --> 19:12.120
Well, so… can we have a look at them?

19:14.560 --> 19:15.680
-No.
-Why not?

19:16.200 --> 19:17.960
They’re part of the investigation.

19:18.040 --> 19:20.440
I have something to do
with this investigation as well.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.520
I could have a look, make a suggestion.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.840
Guys, you don’t understand.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.920
We are up against
a very interesting personality.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.720
What are you laughing about?

19:31.800 --> 19:33.400
What’s so funny? I don’t understand.

19:33.480 --> 19:35.520
For starters,
he’s a brilliant psychologist.

19:35.600 --> 19:39.280
He can plant his ideas
into people’s heads.

19:39.360 --> 19:40.480
Right. So what?

19:40.560 --> 19:43.320
He uses words as a weapon.

19:43.400 --> 19:46.640
That means anything he says
has an underlying message.

19:46.720 --> 19:47.960
Something like…

19:49.000 --> 19:50.280
a code or something?

19:50.360 --> 19:52.160
Plainly speaking, yes, a code.

19:52.240 --> 19:53.600
Sorry, I’m dumb.

19:56.040 --> 19:57.120
But handsome.

19:58.000 --> 19:59.360
Esenya, Sasha’s right.

20:00.880 --> 20:03.360
I never agree with him,
but this time he’s right.

20:04.400 --> 20:06.520
This guy killed Anya, you see?

20:06.600 --> 20:09.240
We need to pursue every possibility.

20:10.640 --> 20:13.600
All the more so
since you don’t know what to do.

20:14.080 --> 20:16.720
-What makes you think that?
-Why else would you be sitting here?

20:33.520 --> 20:34.600
<i>Meglin…</i>

20:35.600 --> 20:40.320
<i>you think you can do everything,</i>
<i>but you can’t do a thing.</i>

20:41.520 --> 20:43.720
<i>You think everything</i>
<i>is under your control…</i>

20:44.960 --> 20:46.480
<i>but it’s me who’s in control.</i>

20:48.000 --> 20:50.480
<i>Instead of looking inside yourself,</i>

20:50.560 --> 20:52.720
<i>you’ve played the wrong card</i>
<i>over and over again.</i>

20:53.880 --> 20:55.080
<i>You’ve betrayed yourself.</i>

20:57.760 --> 21:01.480
<i>I want to show you how pathetic</i>
<i>and helpless the world you created is.</i>

21:02.200 --> 21:04.040
<i>What is this order of yours worth?</i>

21:04.120 --> 21:07.120
<i>Tomorrow, I will strike closer to you,</i>
<i>and you’ll be helpless.</i>

21:08.640 --> 21:10.160
<i>You won’t be able to stop me.</i>

21:13.960 --> 21:17.000
<i>You won’t… catch me.</i>

21:44.200 --> 21:45.200
Bring him in.

21:59.200 --> 21:59.920
What’s this?

22:01.040 --> 22:04.640
You didn’t even let him wash himself!
Take the handcuffs off him.

22:16.200 --> 22:17.240
You can go.

22:32.280 --> 22:33.440
Come on.

22:51.000 --> 22:52.000
Here. Sit.

23:26.800 --> 23:29.720
How did you recognize him?
After so many years.

23:30.760 --> 23:32.120
I just sensed him.

23:34.080 --> 23:35.240
Why didn’t you tell us?

23:37.680 --> 23:40.800
You promised once to find and execute him,
remember?

23:43.880 --> 23:45.880
He didn’t even bother to hide.

23:45.960 --> 23:48.080
On the contrary,
he became a well-known man.

23:48.720 --> 23:51.040
The local cops
were eating out of his hands.

23:51.680 --> 23:55.440
Don’t look at me like that.
I did your job.

23:57.160 --> 23:58.720
Why did you kill the other two?

23:59.360 --> 24:00.800
How were they to blame?

24:01.280 --> 24:02.760
Don’t defend them.

24:03.600 --> 24:04.880
They were criminals.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.680
That’s why you stabbed each of them
20 times?

24:12.880 --> 24:14.920
You think you can do whatever you want?

24:15.000 --> 24:18.360
-He killed my parents!
-That’s not an excuse for killing.

24:20.920 --> 24:22.560
Now you’re just like him. He won. Don’t you see it?

24:26.920 --> 24:29.760
No, he didn’t. He’s dead now.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.360
Tell me honestly.

24:36.520 --> 24:37.880
When you killed them…

24:39.240 --> 24:40.640
what did you feel?

24:42.000 --> 24:43.280
I felt relieved.

24:44.560 --> 24:47.680
It was a weight on me all those years,
and now I’ve freed myself.

24:52.920 --> 24:54.320
I’m done. Take him away.

25:33.840 --> 25:36.280
Rod. Don’t’ be afraid.

25:36.720 --> 25:39.240
They don’t come during the day, see?

25:39.840 --> 25:42.640
They’ll come at night so they can
have a drink right after. Get it?

25:43.280 --> 25:44.920
It’s hard for them to kill.

25:46.600 --> 25:48.000
For you and me, it’s easy.

25:48.600 --> 25:49.400
Shut up!

25:51.360 --> 25:53.280
Scared, huh?

25:53.960 --> 25:55.840
Scared!

26:01.040 --> 26:02.640
Safiulin Rinat Ibragimovich!

26:02.720 --> 26:05.480
Article 105, Part 2-- death penalty!

26:05.560 --> 26:06.640
Meglin Rodion Nikolayevich!

26:06.720 --> 26:09.040
Article 105, Part 2-- death penalty!

26:10.800 --> 26:12.080
Take this one away.

26:15.160 --> 26:16.960
Where? No! No! I want to live!

26:17.040 --> 26:18.440
I don’t want to die!

26:18.520 --> 26:21.360
I don’t want to die! No! No!

26:21.440 --> 26:22.840
Sit down, Rodion.

26:31.800 --> 26:34.680
You’re quick on the uptake,
so I’ll be brief.

26:36.920 --> 26:38.600
You have two options.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.920
Either they take you away like him…

26:42.480 --> 26:43.880
Or?

26:46.120 --> 26:48.320
Or you try to wash away your guilt.

26:49.600 --> 26:50.360
How?

26:52.000 --> 26:53.160
By working for us.

26:54.800 --> 26:55.800
In what capacity?

27:05.000 --> 27:06.200
You got yourself dirty.

27:41.040 --> 27:42.400
Happy birthday, Rodion.

27:44.560 --> 27:47.560
You were officially executed
by firing squad this morning.

27:49.040 --> 27:51.840
So it’s safe to say
that you were born again.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.560
Once more.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.320
Go, go! Cheer up!

28:20.400 --> 28:22.840
You’ll take
your physical training course here.

28:22.920 --> 28:24.200
…two, three!

28:24.280 --> 28:25.800
We live in hard times.

28:26.760 --> 28:29.160
All sorts of filth
are crawling out of the woodwork.

28:29.600 --> 28:32.120
But we’re helpless in many cases.

28:32.200 --> 28:34.120
Our hands are tied by the law.

28:35.200 --> 28:39.160
We have to choose sometimes--
law or justice.

28:40.040 --> 28:42.280
And that’s where you fit in.

28:44.080 --> 28:45.080
Look.

28:47.040 --> 28:48.080
Alexey Anofriev.

28:49.120 --> 28:50.120
Our pride.

28:59.640 --> 29:01.440
You can take him for a model.

29:02.160 --> 29:03.160
I’ll try.

29:20.120 --> 29:23.400
ANOTHER GRADUATION PARTY MURDER
THE MURDERER IS CAUGHT

29:37.760 --> 29:40.360
YOU WON’T CATCH ME

29:49.560 --> 29:51.560
SASHA

29:58.480 --> 29:59.480
Yes. Go ahead.

30:04.160 --> 30:05.160
Listen to Sasha.

30:07.360 --> 30:09.400
<i>I made a linguistic analysis.</i>

30:09.480 --> 30:11.560
-What did you make?
-Rodion.

30:12.640 --> 30:13.640
Go on.

30:14.640 --> 30:17.680
People can leave traces
by their deeds, words,

30:17.760 --> 30:19.160
even by their mere presence.

30:19.880 --> 30:20.880
Get to the point.

30:22.240 --> 30:26.280
<i>I analyzed his every word--</i>
<i>idioms and style of speech--</i>

30:26.360 --> 30:28.400
<i>and put together a preliminary profile.</i>

30:29.840 --> 30:32.400
This man is obsessed with power.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.880
He’s obsessed with power
so much that he challenges himself.

30:36.960 --> 30:39.040
He doesn’t kill
just for the sake of killing.

30:39.120 --> 30:43.520
He wants to be a step ahead
of his most gifted pursuer.

30:43.600 --> 30:47.440
<i>I believe his deliberate emphasizing</i>
<i>of his superiority</i>

30:47.520 --> 30:49.520
<i>is his way to compensate</i>
<i>for some suppressed--</i>

30:49.600 --> 30:51.040
Sasha! My dear!

30:51.120 --> 30:53.000
You think I didn’t know this?

30:53.680 --> 30:55.600
I give you high marks for effort.
Well done.

32:31.000 --> 32:33.880
-Have you informed his relatives?
-He had no relatives.

32:33.960 --> 32:34.960
He lived alone. Do you know him?

32:48.360 --> 32:51.520
Look. Go. One, two, three, four.

32:53.160 --> 32:55.320
Do the same in turn.

33:02.760 --> 33:04.240
Good. Switch.

33:15.440 --> 33:16.680
Come on, come on!

33:16.760 --> 33:17.600
Come on!

33:21.120 --> 33:22.520
What are you doing?

33:22.600 --> 33:23.880
What happened? Hello, Rodion.

33:37.080 --> 33:39.000
As I see, you worked up some muscle.

33:39.440 --> 33:41.960
Now it’s time to learn
how to keep it under control.

33:42.040 --> 33:43.120
Get in the car.

34:14.280 --> 34:15.199
Yes?

34:15.280 --> 34:17.880
<i>Already at the scene?</i>
<i>Put Meglin on the phone.</i>

34:21.960 --> 34:22.960
It’s him.

34:26.679 --> 34:27.800
I’m listening.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.600
<i>You haven’t even tried to do something,</i>
<i>Meglin.</i>

34:30.679 --> 34:32.719
<i>I expected more from you.</i>

34:32.800 --> 34:34.480
I’m sorry to disappoint you.

34:35.040 --> 34:37.840
<i>Do you see the whole picture now?</i>

34:37.920 --> 34:39.320
Not really. Clarify.

34:40.159 --> 34:41.560
<i>What about some intrigue?</i>

34:42.080 --> 34:44.120
<i>You know what, let’s turn it up.</i>

34:44.199 --> 34:48.760
<i>A man with your mind will easily calculate</i>
<i>the next target based on my actions.</i>

34:48.840 --> 34:53.520
<i>So I’ll make the next strike,</i>
<i>say, in three hours.</i>

34:54.480 --> 34:56.320
<i>Your move, Meglin.</i>

35:14.240 --> 35:15.360
Who is he?

35:16.160 --> 35:18.800
My supervisor. My old supervisor.

35:36.920 --> 35:39.360
I think I understand what he wants to say.

35:42.080 --> 35:45.040
Nikita killed his classroom teacher.

35:45.680 --> 35:47.800
Grigoriev was your supervisor.

35:48.960 --> 35:51.280
-He kills--
-Superiors, right?

35:53.800 --> 35:55.440
A logical trap.

35:56.000 --> 35:57.200
What do you mean?

35:57.280 --> 35:59.080
He’s working me, don’t you see?

36:00.440 --> 36:02.360
-How?
-Like with everyone else.

36:02.960 --> 36:04.600
He’s trying to win me over.

36:05.840 --> 36:09.320
You’re not to blame, Meglin.
They made you what you are.

36:10.200 --> 36:12.760
Look, Nikita wasn’t the killer. It was me.

36:14.720 --> 36:16.200
He wants to be friends.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.440
Hello, Rodion.

36:29.760 --> 36:31.480
Bergich Vadim Mikhailovich.

36:32.960 --> 36:34.120
We’ll work together.

36:34.200 --> 36:38.640
You… are not an ordinary person.

36:40.360 --> 36:42.200
I think you know this.

36:43.200 --> 36:45.600
-You want to say I’m mental.
-Yes.

36:47.120 --> 36:51.600
The traumatic events in your childhood
altered your psyche.

36:53.360 --> 36:55.840
It started to function differently.

36:58.200 --> 36:59.200
What does that mean?

37:00.960 --> 37:02.160
You see…

37:03.480 --> 37:05.280
the human brain is like…

37:06.480 --> 37:09.240
a house… with thousands of doors.

37:10.600 --> 37:12.240
If one door closes,

37:12.320 --> 37:15.240
the draft can push open another door.

37:15.920 --> 37:20.960
By hiding from the horror and guilt
after the death of your parents,

37:21.040 --> 37:22.640
you shut all the doors to emotion.

37:24.280 --> 37:27.160
An instinct,
a feeling woke up inside of you.

37:28.880 --> 37:31.560
You started to exhibit a pathology.

37:33.760 --> 37:36.680
I’ll teach you how to deal with it.

37:41.400 --> 37:44.800
Take your time. Look closely at them.

37:46.040 --> 37:48.480
Try not to think.
Thoughts can be disruptive.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.480
Try… just to see.

37:53.480 --> 37:54.680
What do you see?

37:58.280 --> 38:00.400
-That guy over there.
-What about him?

38:01.600 --> 38:02.800
A chameleon.

38:04.280 --> 38:06.800
Hating you while smiling to your face.

38:06.880 --> 38:08.560
If he had his way, he’d kill everyone.

38:10.360 --> 38:11.360
That’s true.

38:12.760 --> 38:15.760
Believe me, he’ll never leave this place.
What else?

38:29.880 --> 38:31.240
The old man.

38:33.800 --> 38:34.800
Are you sure?

38:36.560 --> 38:37.680
He’s one of us.

38:39.560 --> 38:40.560
What did you say?

38:42.400 --> 38:43.520
Our kind.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.480
Will I be like this forever?

38:50.640 --> 38:52.440
Well, more or less.

38:53.760 --> 38:56.920
You won’t be able to establish contact
with ordinary people,

38:57.000 --> 38:59.240
but you’ll always sense our kind.

39:00.960 --> 39:03.920
At times,
you’ll be desperate to become like them.

39:04.000 --> 39:07.200
There are many ways of suppression--
drugs, alcohol.

39:09.160 --> 39:10.720
But don’t go too deeply into them.

39:11.360 --> 39:13.120
There may be no way out.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.800
Your training is over.
You won’t be going back to the base.

39:49.680 --> 39:53.240
Look closely at this and memorize it.

39:55.480 --> 39:57.840
This is a serial rapist, a pedophile.

40:00.120 --> 40:02.600
We arrested him, but we had to let him go.

40:03.240 --> 40:05.960
We only had circumstantial evidence--
nothing to present in court.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.120
But we know for sure it’s him.

40:08.960 --> 40:10.360
Find him and keep an eye on him.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.440
We need to know your opinion.

40:25.400 --> 40:27.440
What if it’s really him?

40:30.240 --> 40:31.240
Here.

40:32.280 --> 40:33.520
Take it.

40:34.880 --> 40:38.040
The best weapon is one you can depend on.

40:39.360 --> 40:40.320
See you.

40:59.120 --> 41:01.920
When Grigoriev left,
who became your supervisor?

41:03.280 --> 41:04.960
He’s the next victim.

41:11.360 --> 41:12.360
Nonsense.

41:13.080 --> 41:14.480
He won’t dare. Himself-- not likely.

41:17.360 --> 41:19.200
Using someone else-- absolutely.

41:20.400 --> 41:22.480
Grigoriev was killed
by an ex-military man.

41:24.800 --> 41:27.560
Who knows?
Maybe he has you in his sights right now.

41:32.640 --> 41:35.320
You need to hide, just for a while.

41:35.400 --> 41:36.400
No. What for?

41:41.240 --> 41:43.080
How much time do we have?

41:44.320 --> 41:45.360
Two hours.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.560
Go see Bergich in the meantime.

41:49.760 --> 41:51.160
Why?

41:51.240 --> 41:53.640
Search for crazy veterans in the archive.

41:57.080 --> 41:58.280
I got it.

41:58.360 --> 42:00.600
-You want to send me away.
-I don’t care what you got!

42:00.680 --> 42:04.160
-On your feet and get out of here!
-You have no right to do this! You--

42:05.440 --> 42:08.480
-You both have no right to do this.
-We do!

42:20.920 --> 42:22.600
I haven’t taken a walk in ages.

42:40.880 --> 42:43.680
-One moment, miss. He’s busy.
-I need to see him. It’s urgent.

42:44.360 --> 42:45.760
SECURITY

42:45.840 --> 42:47.400
They had to die!

42:47.480 --> 42:49.840
-Everybody had to die!
-Quiet!

42:54.240 --> 42:55.680
What’s he doing here?

42:56.280 --> 42:57.760
He’s being examined.

42:58.440 --> 43:01.040
Lena, show her to the archive.

43:05.800 --> 43:07.000
Shall we continue?

43:14.600 --> 43:15.600
Tell me…

43:17.480 --> 43:20.640
are you afraid of death?

43:25.600 --> 43:27.240
We don’t have the death penalty.

43:28.160 --> 43:29.400
That’s not what I mean.

43:31.080 --> 43:32.400
In general.

43:34.920 --> 43:36.320
Accidental death.

43:39.360 --> 43:41.760
It would be for the best
if all people disappeared.

43:43.160 --> 43:44.320
Including me.

43:45.760 --> 43:49.600
Killing was the only way for me
to find my true self.

43:49.680 --> 43:52.760
I’d rather be my true self in here
than live out there.

43:53.320 --> 43:55.640
My whole life,
I’ve pretended to be normal.

43:56.280 --> 43:57.560
But I’m not normal.

43:58.200 --> 43:59.600
I don’t want to be normal.

44:01.440 --> 44:03.920
And to what extent
do you think this decision is your own…

44:05.800 --> 44:09.120
and to what extent were you, let’s say…

44:10.160 --> 44:11.240
pushed?

44:12.600 --> 44:14.080
He didn’t push me.

44:15.440 --> 44:17.040
He just taught me how.

44:18.760 --> 44:21.400
I wandered in the darkness,
and he gave me light.

44:22.040 --> 44:24.440
I’m turning into the person
I’m meant to be.

44:25.600 --> 44:27.720
-But you haven’t yet.
-Soon!

44:35.120 --> 44:37.120
RUBEL

44:40.360 --> 44:42.120
<i>In 30 minutes.</i>

44:42.200 --> 44:43.920
<i>The rowing canal embankment.</i>

44:45.280 --> 44:46.480
<i>They’re coming.</i>

44:48.640 --> 44:50.080
I’m sorry for the old man.

44:50.880 --> 44:53.560
-When was the last time you saw him?
-About five years ago.

44:54.040 --> 44:56.360
It’s a pity. He taught me a lot.

44:59.040 --> 45:00.640
How much time is left?

45:02.440 --> 45:03.920
Don’t take too long.

45:36.040 --> 45:37.640
The three hours have passed. It’s over.

45:40.160 --> 45:41.360
Meglin!

45:42.720 --> 45:44.520
On your knees! Hands behind your head!

45:47.280 --> 45:48.760
Are you prepared to listen?

45:48.840 --> 45:50.040
Put it down.

45:51.880 --> 45:53.960
You think you’re well off?

45:54.960 --> 45:57.480
You live while your brothers are dying.

45:58.160 --> 46:00.280
You’re a lion serving jackals.

46:01.040 --> 46:02.640
It’s not your fault.

46:03.720 --> 46:06.960
You were taught that way--
to live by their rules.

46:07.840 --> 46:09.440
<i>It’s their fault.</i>

46:10.280 --> 46:12.880
<i>They turned you into their tame animal.</i>

46:14.160 --> 46:17.520
<i>I will give you freedom,</i>
<i>and I will put them to death.</i>

46:18.160 --> 46:19.960
Who’s he talking about, Rodion?

46:20.560 --> 46:22.880
Welcome to my world,

46:23.520 --> 46:25.240
a world without rules.

46:26.400 --> 46:27.720
About teachers.

46:30.240 --> 46:31.240
So…

46:31.680 --> 46:35.280
You didn’t teach me anything.
Then it’s-- It’s Bergich!

46:35.360 --> 46:37.280
-What?
-Call Esenya!

47:01.640 --> 47:02.720
Yes, Dad. Esenya, stop!

47:45.960 --> 47:47.280
Don’t.

48:17.160 --> 48:22.080
Rubel left the gun for him a month ago
when he stayed here himself.

48:22.880 --> 48:24.720
He planned everything beforehand.

48:26.760 --> 48:28.480
Okay then, see you.

48:38.120 --> 48:39.120
It’s him.

48:39.760 --> 48:41.200
Put him on speaker.

48:42.640 --> 48:44.480
UNKNOWN NUMBER

48:44.560 --> 48:47.440
<i>You don’t think it’s over, do you?</i>

48:48.480 --> 48:50.080
<i>This was the first round.</i> <i>I’ll beat you.</i>

48:53.280 --> 48:55.560
<i>I’ll make you become who you really are.</i>

48:56.720 --> 48:59.680
<i>You must understand-- either we’re allies,</i>

49:00.360 --> 49:02.160
<i>or I’ll destroy you.</i>

49:03.880 --> 49:06.040
<i>Every person is a cowardly killer.</i>

49:06.120 --> 49:08.760
<i>Brave ones, like us, are the few.</i>

49:08.840 --> 49:12.920
<i>You and I have more in common</i>
<i>than you have with them.</i>

49:13.840 --> 49:15.960
<i>Life is chaos, Meglin.</i>

49:16.760 --> 49:18.800
<i>It doesn’t give protection or love.</i>

49:19.680 --> 49:21.600
-<i>It’s the opium of the people.</i>
-Shut him off.

49:21.680 --> 49:23.720
-Off?
-Fucking shut him off!

49:23.800 --> 49:25.800
<i>I want to show people a life--</i>

49:38.320 --> 49:40.600
That’s what I was talking about.

49:40.680 --> 49:43.560
Why didn’t you try
to identify him immediately?

49:44.320 --> 49:46.600
Why didn’t you start looking for him?

49:48.400 --> 49:52.160
Because at that moment,
he didn’t know how to look.

49:57.720 --> 50:04.320
VLADIMIR
