WEBVTT

00:03.172 --> 00:05.000
- Previously on
"Hit the Floor"...

00:05.068 --> 00:07.310
- Interesting that everything
I have is everything you want.

00:07.379 --> 00:09.482
- I'm no rebound,
and that scares you.

00:09.551 --> 00:10.793
I'm end game.

00:10.862 --> 00:12.551
- Us staying together,

00:12.620 --> 00:14.137
it'll hurt what each of us
are trying to do.

00:14.206 --> 00:15.344
- If this is what you want,

00:15.413 --> 00:16.724
there's nothing
I can say about it.

00:16.793 --> 00:19.034
- Does that mean...
- I think it does.

00:22.241 --> 00:23.965
- I love you too...

00:24.034 --> 00:25.241
you son of a bitch.

00:25.310 --> 00:26.551
- I'm scared to death,

00:26.620 --> 00:28.137
but I wanna take
this chance with you.

00:28.206 --> 00:30.000
I wanna be brave.

00:32.275 --> 00:33.793
- Devils Arena is a hellmouth.

00:33.862 --> 00:36.862
- Your parents chose a life
in the hellmouth

00:36.931 --> 00:38.793
instead of a life with you.

00:38.862 --> 00:40.827
- Only thing that'll save
the Devils from extinction

00:40.896 --> 00:41.965
is a title.

00:42.034 --> 00:43.482
- You do your worst,

00:43.551 --> 00:44.551
and I'll do mine.

01:03.448 --> 01:05.413
- LA is on fire, people.

01:05.482 --> 01:06.827
It's triple digits
in the streets,

01:06.896 --> 01:09.586
and absolutely scorching
inside Devils Arena,

01:09.655 --> 01:11.241
with the Devils on
an eight-game hot streak.

01:11.310 --> 01:13.655
Pax, you're one-half
of the dynamic duo

01:13.724 --> 01:14.931
fanning the flames.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.413
It's your first playoffs.

01:16.482 --> 01:18.241
Think you'll keep it going
with today's game?

01:18.310 --> 01:21.068
- If I don't,
this guy here will kick my ass.

01:21.137 --> 01:22.344
- Oh!

01:22.413 --> 01:23.586
Derek, where is
this coming from?

01:23.655 --> 01:25.586
- Uh, I like kicking ass.

01:25.655 --> 01:27.896
It's all about
winning the title, so...

01:27.965 --> 01:31.482
we are playing like
our lives depend on it.

01:31.551 --> 01:32.827
- We'll see later today

01:32.896 --> 01:34.517
if the Devils can make it
nine for nine.

01:34.586 --> 01:35.896
- Hi, Mom.

01:35.965 --> 01:37.103
- Rookie.

01:37.172 --> 01:38.379
- Exactly.

01:38.448 --> 01:39.827
- Seriously, though,
are you juicing,

01:39.896 --> 01:41.379
or what's--what's--
- Get out of here.

01:41.448 --> 01:43.448
- Come on.
- This guy.

01:43.517 --> 01:45.586
You heard from Eve?
- Don't worry about her, okay?

01:45.655 --> 01:47.758
You focus on the court,
on winning,

01:47.827 --> 01:50.000
and I'll take care of Eve.
- You got a plan?

01:50.068 --> 01:51.689
- She's not a snake
in the grass anymore.

01:51.758 --> 01:54.655
The minute she pops up,
I'll be there.

02:00.413 --> 02:03.275
- Okay...spill it.

02:03.344 --> 02:04.793
- Spill what?
- Ever since the ISNYs,

02:04.862 --> 02:06.896
there's been weird juju
from your team.

02:06.965 --> 02:08.896
That interview was tense.

02:08.965 --> 02:10.275
Something's up.

02:10.344 --> 02:12.517
- You already told me
you can't keep a secret.

02:12.586 --> 02:14.517
- So there is a secret?
- Oh, my God.

02:14.586 --> 02:16.137
Bye.

02:19.758 --> 02:22.241
- The AC in the arena's busted?
Today is gonna be rough.

02:22.310 --> 02:25.000
- Hello.
- Morning.

02:25.068 --> 02:26.310
- You got a second?

02:26.379 --> 02:28.758
- Yeah, take a few.

02:28.827 --> 02:30.241
- Look, um...

02:30.310 --> 02:32.206
I've been thinking about
what you said at the ISNYs,

02:32.275 --> 02:34.241
that there's more to this dance

02:34.310 --> 02:36.068
and what we're doing,

02:36.137 --> 02:38.103
and, well...

02:38.172 --> 02:39.482
I think you may be right.

02:39.551 --> 02:42.103
- I don't need you to tell me
I'm right.

02:42.172 --> 02:44.586
- Okay, then how 'bout a date?

02:45.965 --> 02:48.689
I don't jump when Derek Roman
snaps his fingers.

02:48.758 --> 02:50.137
I'm not that easy.

02:50.206 --> 02:51.517
I'm glad you had
your revelation.

02:51.586 --> 02:53.379
You can live with it now.

03:00.275 --> 03:02.241
- Kyle?

03:03.655 --> 03:06.241
Surprise, I'm back, baby.

03:10.310 --> 03:11.931
Man, I missed you, Kyle.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.862
- Don't you "baby" me.

03:16.206 --> 03:17.793
You don't get to declare
your love for me,

03:17.862 --> 03:21.275
make me declare it right back--
something I have never done--

03:21.344 --> 03:22.586
then saunter back
two years later

03:22.655 --> 03:24.965
with a "hey, baby"
and some cheap flowers.

03:25.034 --> 03:27.068
- Okay, okay, okay, okay.

03:27.137 --> 03:29.241
Come on, Kyle, listen,
you know I had to disappear

03:29.310 --> 03:31.206
till things cooled down.
It got hot.

03:31.275 --> 03:32.965
- It cooled down months ago,

03:33.034 --> 03:34.551
but you still stayed away.

03:34.620 --> 03:36.517
Well, Kyle Hart
waits for no man.

03:36.586 --> 03:39.482
- Whoa, whoa, whoa...

03:39.551 --> 03:43.068
I've never stopped
thinking about you,

03:43.137 --> 03:44.965
or the cabin in Big Bear...

03:45.034 --> 03:48.655
the roof of the Pacific
Design Center...

03:48.724 --> 03:49.758
twice.

03:51.758 --> 03:54.793
- I have moved on,
and you need to move on...

03:54.862 --> 03:56.827
out of my life.

03:56.896 --> 03:58.931
Beau, bye.

04:05.689 --> 04:07.103
- All right, we got that.
Moving on.

04:07.172 --> 04:08.655
- Hello, Jamie.

04:08.724 --> 04:11.413
Omar Malick, producer
of "Du Monde" magazine.

04:11.482 --> 04:13.068
Of course, the day
we come to Devils arena,

04:13.137 --> 04:14.827
it's hot as hell.

04:14.896 --> 04:16.965
- Were you expecting to shoot
a fashion spread, featurette,

04:17.034 --> 04:18.758
and a dance in one day,
and not break a little sweat?

04:18.827 --> 04:21.172
- That would be ludicrous.

04:21.241 --> 04:22.586
- Rolling!

04:22.655 --> 04:24.586
- Hi, I'm Jamie Lawson,

04:24.655 --> 04:27.413
and I'm gonna be the cover girl
for "Du Monde" magazine's

04:27.482 --> 04:29.103
Devil Girls edition.

04:29.172 --> 04:31.241
- Is that so?

04:31.310 --> 04:32.551
- There can only be one of us.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.655
- Tell me why it should be you.

04:34.724 --> 04:37.689
- We all get here
different ways.

04:37.758 --> 04:39.655
I came by car.

04:39.724 --> 04:42.517
But I didn't just drive mine.

04:42.586 --> 04:45.689
I lived in it...for months.

04:45.758 --> 04:46.965
- Really?

04:47.034 --> 04:49.965
- That's what it took,
and I do what it takes.

04:50.034 --> 04:51.620
- Your parents
instilled that in you?

04:51.689 --> 04:55.448
- My mother was hooked
on my father, literally.

04:55.517 --> 04:58.103
He was her dealer.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.793
She chose heroin over me,

04:59.862 --> 05:01.551
and I chose myself.

05:01.620 --> 05:02.896
Being a Devil Girl means

05:02.965 --> 05:06.620
I am capable of achieving
anything I want,

05:06.689 --> 05:08.482
no matter what's in my way.

05:08.551 --> 05:11.275
- That's powerful stuff.
Thank you for opening up.

05:15.448 --> 05:17.344
- That was inspiring.

05:17.413 --> 05:20.586
Our stories are so similar.

05:20.655 --> 05:22.827
I didn't live in my car,

05:22.896 --> 05:26.344
but I didn't have
my parents much either.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.758
You learn to rely on yourself

05:27.827 --> 05:30.586
in a way most people
wouldn't understand.

05:30.655 --> 05:32.344
- Most don't try.

05:32.413 --> 05:36.034
- Sometimes, surviving
requires having an ally.

05:36.103 --> 05:37.275
There may come a time

05:37.344 --> 05:39.448
when you could use
my help around here,

05:39.517 --> 05:42.172
or I could use yours.

05:42.241 --> 05:44.551
- I'm not what you need.

05:44.620 --> 05:46.413
- I'm not so sure.

05:46.482 --> 05:48.517
- I am.

05:54.724 --> 05:56.241
- We can access
the lighting grid?

05:56.310 --> 05:59.068
- They said yes.
Anything else you need?

05:59.137 --> 06:01.896
- To interview the legendary
London Scott.

06:01.965 --> 06:04.448
- I have to focus
on the dance.

06:04.517 --> 06:06.068
Later would be better.
- Okay.

06:06.137 --> 06:09.172
We can really take our time
and dig in.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.379
- Hey.

06:21.344 --> 06:23.448
- I didn't know you even knew
this room existed.

06:23.517 --> 06:26.758
- I didn't.
I have you GeoTracked.

06:28.172 --> 06:29.586
What's on your mind?

06:29.655 --> 06:32.586
- Same thing that's on yours,
from the looks of it.

06:33.448 --> 06:34.931
Have you heard from her?

06:35.000 --> 06:37.551
- Not since the last time
you checked.

06:41.275 --> 06:43.068
I did not see that coming.

06:43.137 --> 06:44.931
- None of us did.

06:45.000 --> 06:47.793
- Well, I knew Eve a little
better than the rest of you.

06:49.793 --> 06:51.827
- I knew her as well
as you did.

06:51.896 --> 06:53.482
- No.

06:53.551 --> 06:55.931
- Ha, yes.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.000
As well as you did.

06:59.689 --> 07:02.241
- Wait, while you and I...
- Before.

07:02.310 --> 07:04.448
You got my sloppy seconds.

07:05.827 --> 07:07.448
I was hoping
by telling you this,

07:07.517 --> 07:08.689
we could get our heads together

07:08.758 --> 07:10.413
and figure out a way
to cool her down.

07:12.793 --> 07:14.862
Let go of the image, German.

07:14.931 --> 07:16.241
- Right.

07:18.000 --> 07:19.448
Well, I don't know
what it's gonna take.

07:19.517 --> 07:20.655
She's angry.

07:20.724 --> 07:23.137
She reminds me of her mother.

07:23.206 --> 07:25.551
- You knew Olivia well?

07:25.620 --> 07:27.586
- Not really.

07:31.620 --> 07:34.241
- Well, we're gonna have
to figure something out.

07:34.310 --> 07:35.965
She's been quiet.

07:36.034 --> 07:38.586
In my experience,
that can be a very bad thing.

07:45.586 --> 07:50.068
- Here you are, sir.
For two.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.241
- Hello, Oscar.

07:52.310 --> 07:53.965
- Eve.

07:54.034 --> 07:56.413
Delighted to meet you,
young lady.

07:59.862 --> 08:03.103
Olivia and Chase's daughter.

08:03.172 --> 08:05.517
- You were close?
- Oh, with each of them...

08:05.586 --> 08:08.379
in their own individual ways.

08:08.448 --> 08:10.413
Perhaps we can be close
as well.

08:10.482 --> 08:11.724
- I like that,

08:11.793 --> 08:14.172
doing business with
Oscar Kinkade.

08:15.689 --> 08:17.551
- That's one of the reasons
I called you.

08:17.620 --> 08:19.482
I work for the League.

08:19.551 --> 08:21.034
There's a city block
in West LA

08:21.103 --> 08:23.206
that would make the perfect
home for a new team.

08:23.275 --> 08:25.931
It meets all the zoning
requirements.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.448
- I know.

08:27.517 --> 08:29.172
I own it.

08:30.551 --> 08:33.551
And you'll be richer
when you sell it.

08:33.620 --> 08:36.000
I have an interested party.

08:36.068 --> 08:37.379
- Mm.

08:37.448 --> 08:39.758
Another team owner?

08:41.448 --> 08:43.551
You know my son
owns the Devils.

08:43.620 --> 08:45.689
If you're bringing
this up to me,

08:45.758 --> 08:47.551
you know my relationship
with him.

08:47.620 --> 08:51.448
- You'll get the satisfaction
of smacking him down,

08:51.517 --> 08:55.206
where he belongs perhaps.

08:55.275 --> 08:57.310
- Where do I belong?

08:59.103 --> 09:01.758
Do you really think
that I wouldn't know

09:01.827 --> 09:05.172
that Olivia and Chase
had a child?

09:05.241 --> 09:08.724
Your parents kept you away
because of me.

09:08.793 --> 09:13.034
You carry quite a grudge
as a result.

09:13.103 --> 09:15.793
You're going after the Devils.

09:15.862 --> 09:18.586
What makes me think
you won't come after me too?

09:20.827 --> 09:24.896
Oscar Kinkade should be able
to handle any adversary.

09:24.965 --> 09:26.758
- I seem to have a weakness

09:26.827 --> 09:29.413
when it comes to
beautiful women.

09:29.482 --> 09:33.620
I don't take them as seriously
as I should sometimes.

09:34.965 --> 09:37.379
You are so much like
your mother.

09:39.000 --> 09:41.689
You should focus that anger
on the person

09:41.758 --> 09:44.172
who really took
your mother from you.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.931
- Raquel Saldana is dead.

09:48.000 --> 09:50.758
- Raquel Saldana was covering

09:50.827 --> 09:53.413
for the person
who really did it...

09:55.172 --> 09:57.551
German Vega.

09:59.724 --> 10:01.275
You look smashing together

10:01.344 --> 10:05.275
in those red carpet photos,
by the way.

10:05.344 --> 10:06.793
- You're a liar.

10:06.862 --> 10:08.793
- Has anything
you ever heard about me

10:08.862 --> 10:12.551
suggested I lie?

10:12.620 --> 10:15.655
- If what you're saying
were true,

10:15.724 --> 10:17.344
everybody would know.

10:20.862 --> 10:22.586
Everybody does.

10:28.448 --> 10:31.379
- Yes!
- Somebody's happy.

10:31.448 --> 10:33.413
- First playoff win.

10:33.482 --> 10:35.206
- Rookies.

10:37.517 --> 10:39.896
- Hey.

10:39.965 --> 10:41.310
- Are you gonna kiss me again?

10:43.241 --> 10:46.448
I told you, that was just
excitement for keeping my job.

10:46.517 --> 10:47.724
- Okay.

10:47.793 --> 10:49.517
- I told you a lie.

10:49.586 --> 10:51.689
Today, for the first time,

10:51.758 --> 10:53.965
I scored higher
than Derek Roman.

10:54.034 --> 10:55.724
I know greatness
matters to you,

10:55.793 --> 10:58.517
so I waited for
this very moment

10:58.586 --> 11:00.000
to ask you out.

11:00.068 --> 11:02.206
- You're...
- Asking you out.

11:02.275 --> 11:03.517
That's right.

11:03.586 --> 11:05.620
You, me,

11:05.689 --> 11:07.689
a date.

11:07.758 --> 11:09.172
So, when are you free?

11:09.241 --> 11:11.689
- Pax...I like you...

11:11.758 --> 11:14.206
- Not the friend zone.
- No.

11:14.275 --> 11:16.275
Actually...

11:16.344 --> 11:18.344
- No?
- Well, yes,

11:18.413 --> 11:20.517
but it's not about you.

11:20.586 --> 11:21.862
I'm not dating
anyone right now.

11:21.931 --> 11:23.551
I'm taking time
to work on myself

11:23.620 --> 11:26.827
and what I need to get done
the rest of the season.

11:26.896 --> 11:28.517
It's an important time
for you too,

11:28.586 --> 11:30.034
even more so.

11:30.103 --> 11:32.965
You should be doing the same.

11:33.034 --> 11:35.482
- It's the friend zone.
- It's not.

11:35.551 --> 11:37.551
I see you, Pax,

11:37.620 --> 11:40.172
and I like what we have.

11:40.241 --> 11:42.310
I just...

11:42.379 --> 11:44.482
I hope it's enough.

11:44.551 --> 11:46.344
- You're lucky you're cute.

11:47.724 --> 11:48.862
- Drinks on me, buddy.

11:48.931 --> 11:50.310
- Noah.
- Yeah?

11:50.379 --> 11:53.172
- I flew out from New York
to see the game and you.

11:53.241 --> 11:54.344
- Thanks.

11:54.413 --> 11:55.689
I've been working on my glutes.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.275
I do this--these squat things,

11:57.344 --> 11:59.137
where I--I have this dumbbell
through my legs, and--

11:59.206 --> 12:00.586
- Yeah, yeah, listen,
I'm gonna be brief,

12:00.655 --> 12:01.793
because it's hot
as balls in here.

12:01.862 --> 12:03.517
I run a network morning show,

12:03.586 --> 12:06.068
and our sports guy is, like,
older than Mount Rushmore.

12:06.137 --> 12:08.103
So, we're on the hunt
for a replacement--

12:08.172 --> 12:09.586
someone younger,
less atrophied.

12:09.655 --> 12:11.482
I think you'd be perfect.

12:11.551 --> 12:12.965
- To start next season or...

12:13.034 --> 12:14.586
- Well, trying to avoid
an on-air collapse.

12:14.655 --> 12:16.482
I mean, we'd need you ASAP.

12:18.068 --> 12:19.551
- I mean, that's a big ask.

12:19.620 --> 12:21.862
- Yeah, and a big move up
over sideline duties.

12:21.931 --> 12:24.482
- And a big move to New York.

12:24.551 --> 12:27.137
- And a big pay bump.

12:27.206 --> 12:29.413
And you're thinking about it.

12:35.413 --> 12:37.137
- Brace yourself, Omar.

12:37.206 --> 12:38.689
- We're ready if your crew is.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.275
- Let's do it.

12:40.344 --> 12:41.448
Play back.

14:58.862 --> 15:00.931
Why the hell
are you still here?

15:01.000 --> 15:03.448
- Engine won't start.

15:03.517 --> 15:04.827
I'm working on it.

15:04.896 --> 15:07.827
Can't we talk this out
in the meantime?

15:07.896 --> 15:09.758
- Oh, now you wanna talk?
- Yeah.

15:09.827 --> 15:13.034
- Nothing you could say
would justify your actions.

15:13.103 --> 15:15.068
- Well, what if I said
I had money?

15:17.482 --> 15:19.586
- No. Uh-uh.

15:19.655 --> 15:22.448
Get this bucket started
and get your ass out of here.

15:31.379 --> 15:34.241
- Did you seriously text me
here to watch you take a bath?

15:34.310 --> 15:35.896
- I thought you'd want in.

15:35.965 --> 15:38.000
- Is that...

15:39.620 --> 15:41.482
- Last ice in the arena.

15:41.551 --> 15:45.206
More precious than diamonds,
and I saved it for you.

15:45.275 --> 15:46.931
Join me?

15:47.000 --> 15:48.655
- Is this your idea of a date?

15:50.172 --> 15:53.275
- Hey, that's cold.

15:53.344 --> 15:55.620
Do that again.

16:00.137 --> 16:03.517
- This is for the ice only.

16:03.586 --> 16:05.034
- Whatever you say.

16:08.689 --> 16:10.517
- Hi, honey...

16:10.586 --> 16:11.965
I'm home.

16:12.034 --> 16:14.517
- What the hell are
you doing here?

16:14.586 --> 16:16.482
- I came to see my son.

16:16.551 --> 16:17.931
Have you seen him?

16:18.000 --> 16:21.586
- Have you stroked out
thinking I would tell you?

16:21.655 --> 16:24.068
It's a shame you came
all this way for nothing.

16:24.137 --> 16:25.931
- I didn't come into town
for Jude.

16:26.000 --> 16:28.068
I came for business.

16:28.137 --> 16:30.689
That's what you pretend to do
all day with my money.

16:32.206 --> 16:34.068
Business with whom?

16:34.137 --> 16:35.655
- Eve Vincent.

16:35.724 --> 16:39.034
- What business could you
possibly have with her?

16:39.103 --> 16:40.655
- She had business with me.

16:40.724 --> 16:43.517
- She hates you.
- She hates someone else more.

16:43.586 --> 16:47.137
Now, as much as I love
watching you walk away,

16:47.206 --> 16:50.241
you'll have to have
the honor this time.

16:50.310 --> 16:51.482
Excuse me.

17:04.827 --> 17:06.965
- Perfect timing.

17:07.034 --> 17:08.551
Come on in.

17:16.241 --> 17:18.241
- I'm gonna work on the AC.
- Why?

17:18.310 --> 17:21.068
- 'Cause the repair man can't
get here until tomorrow,

17:21.137 --> 17:23.344
and I gotta do something
to help my team.

17:23.413 --> 17:24.896
How has your day been?

17:24.965 --> 17:26.758
Anything interesting?

17:26.827 --> 17:28.586
- Uh, no.

17:28.655 --> 17:30.689
- Okay.

17:30.758 --> 17:32.172
- I'll come with you.

17:32.241 --> 17:34.206
- You know how to fix
industrial AC systems?

17:34.275 --> 17:35.586
- Nope...

17:35.655 --> 17:37.931
But I doubt you do,
so I am not missing this.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.000
- Let's go.

17:41.620 --> 17:43.862
- Oh...
- Yo, Kyle, are you okay?

17:45.862 --> 17:47.758
- He's taunting me.

17:51.793 --> 17:54.896
I've been helping you.
Now you gotta help me.

17:56.620 --> 17:59.068
Keep me from going to town
on that man.

17:59.137 --> 18:00.310
Naked Town.

18:00.379 --> 18:02.482
- Uh...
- I need him gone.

18:02.551 --> 18:05.103
Get out there
and get his engine running,

18:05.172 --> 18:06.551
before I do.

18:06.620 --> 18:08.241
- All right, all right,
I'm on it.

18:13.241 --> 18:14.689
- There you are.
- Here I am.

18:14.758 --> 18:16.172
- Phenomenal dance.

18:16.241 --> 18:17.896
Now you're free for
a phenomenal interview.

18:17.965 --> 18:19.517
- I just saw Mary Beth
in wardrobe.

18:19.586 --> 18:21.655
- You're gonna have to talk
about it at some point.

18:21.724 --> 18:23.344
- Why bother?

18:23.413 --> 18:25.724
We both know the only reason
you'd put me on the cover

18:25.793 --> 18:27.551
is because of the scandal,

18:27.620 --> 18:30.034
and the scandal is not the
reason I wanna be on the cover.

18:30.103 --> 18:32.379
- What else is there?
- Excuse me?

18:33.172 --> 18:35.379
- No one knows
there's more to the story,

18:35.448 --> 18:38.965
because you haven't said a word
about the Pastor publicly.

18:39.896 --> 18:42.551
The person keeping things
one-sided is you.

18:42.620 --> 18:43.931
I want your side.

18:46.448 --> 18:49.758
A lot of people do.

18:49.827 --> 18:51.551
When you're ready.

18:56.620 --> 19:00.275
- So, it's...just you and me...

19:01.068 --> 19:02.379
All alone.

19:04.137 --> 19:06.758
Wanna talk about anything?

19:06.827 --> 19:09.965
Anything...Devils-related?

19:10.034 --> 19:11.862
- Nope.

19:14.448 --> 19:16.000
- Is it a person,
place, or thing?

19:19.793 --> 19:22.344
- Just give me
the number of syllables.

19:22.413 --> 19:23.931
- If you tagged along
to get info out of me,

19:24.000 --> 19:25.275
you're wasting your time.

19:25.344 --> 19:27.344
- I can break anyone.
Why can't I break you?

19:27.413 --> 19:28.689
- I'm a frustrating guy.

19:28.758 --> 19:30.344
- You are.

19:30.413 --> 19:32.000
And this ability you have

19:32.068 --> 19:35.517
to just say absolutely nothing
is just--

19:35.586 --> 19:37.344
it's just...

19:48.448 --> 19:50.965
Heat's gotten to you.
- Something has.

20:08.103 --> 20:10.172
- My knee's been killing me.

20:10.241 --> 20:11.862
Too much floor work.

20:11.931 --> 20:13.758
- Mm, yeah, me too.

20:13.827 --> 20:15.241
- Ankle next?

20:15.310 --> 20:17.896
- I mean, I would,
but we're out of ice.

20:19.862 --> 20:22.275
- Why is there champagne here?

20:23.862 --> 20:25.793
- Well, I thought maybe,

20:25.862 --> 20:28.000
but maybe not.

21:09.655 --> 21:11.827
- Little early in the day
for a drink, no?

21:11.896 --> 21:13.827
- It's 5:00 somewhere.

21:15.758 --> 21:17.344
- I know you're upset,

21:17.413 --> 21:18.827
but this has to stop, Eve.

21:18.896 --> 21:21.241
This thing that you have
against the Devils, it's...

21:21.310 --> 21:22.862
- "Thing"?

21:25.620 --> 21:29.448
You know my history, German.

21:29.517 --> 21:33.206
In a way, it's intertwined.

21:33.275 --> 21:35.793
Poetic, if you think about it.

21:37.862 --> 21:39.413
Do you?

21:39.482 --> 21:41.241
Think about it?

21:43.241 --> 21:44.896
- I do.

21:46.551 --> 21:51.068
- I've had a long time
to think about it.

21:51.137 --> 21:53.206
- Why would you bring
Oscar to town?

21:53.275 --> 21:57.482
He's the one you hate the most.

21:57.551 --> 21:58.965
- Is he?

22:01.482 --> 22:04.448
What are you worried
about, German?

22:04.517 --> 22:07.241
It's not like anyone's
showing up dead.

22:12.241 --> 22:13.931
Although...

22:14.000 --> 22:17.137
it's happened before.

22:17.206 --> 22:18.965
It could happen again.

22:25.068 --> 22:28.103
I know you killed my mother.

22:39.586 --> 22:41.275
- How'd it go?
- Great.

22:41.344 --> 22:42.620
Beau's truck is up and running.

22:42.689 --> 22:45.689
- Ugh, thank you, Pax Almighty.

22:45.758 --> 22:48.103
I hope you set his GPS
to "off a cliff."

22:48.172 --> 22:49.931
How'd he look when he
drove away?

22:50.000 --> 22:51.310
Brokenhearted?

22:51.379 --> 22:53.931
- Wow, you look amazing.

22:54.000 --> 22:55.275
Amazing.

22:55.344 --> 22:56.655
- Pax?

22:56.724 --> 22:58.896
How'd he look
when he drove away?

23:00.655 --> 23:02.275
Are you kidding me?

23:02.344 --> 23:04.793
- The guy was melting outside,
and he's hilarious.

23:04.862 --> 23:06.758
Di--did you know that?
- Yes, I know that.

23:06.827 --> 23:09.000
I also know he's--
he's beautiful and gorgeous

23:09.068 --> 23:10.793
and charming
and 20 feet away from me,

23:10.862 --> 23:12.172
and I'm not tethered.

23:12.241 --> 23:13.586
- Ready?

23:13.655 --> 23:16.586
- Yes, uh-huh.
Mm-hmm, yeah.

23:16.655 --> 23:18.310
- Great.
Let's, uh--let's begin.

23:18.379 --> 23:19.931
Um----
Kyle Hart...

23:20.000 --> 23:20.724
- Mm-hmm?

23:20.793 --> 23:23.000
- What has being captain

23:23.068 --> 23:24.724
of the Devil Girls
meant to you?

23:24.793 --> 23:27.448
- Oh, I--I'd say, um..

23:27.517 --> 23:30.310
big things.

23:30.379 --> 23:32.275
Real big.

23:34.931 --> 23:36.448
Huge.

23:36.517 --> 23:38.965
Oh, and--and girthy.

23:39.034 --> 23:40.965
Oh, I'm sorry,
what was the question?

23:41.034 --> 23:43.068
- Here, have some, uh--
have some water.

23:43.137 --> 23:45.275
- Oh. Yeah...

23:45.344 --> 23:47.310
- It's hot, right?
- Yeah.

23:47.379 --> 23:49.517
- Oh--oh...

23:49.586 --> 23:52.137
- Let's keep going.
Um, wh--uh,

23:52.206 --> 23:55.068
how does it feel
to be desired by so many?

23:55.137 --> 23:56.758
- Ah. Ah.

23:56.827 --> 23:59.344
Sometimes, you just
need your can licked.

23:59.413 --> 24:01.551
You know, I--I'm just
going to need a break.

24:05.655 --> 24:08.551
Oh, God. Hurry!

24:37.689 --> 24:39.344
- I gave it up.

24:39.413 --> 24:41.586
Now it's your turn.

24:42.517 --> 24:44.482
- Mm.

24:48.724 --> 24:50.724
- Fine.

24:50.793 --> 24:52.931
I'll go first.

24:55.241 --> 24:57.448
I got a job offer...

24:57.517 --> 25:00.758
in...New York.

25:00.827 --> 25:02.655
- I know.

25:03.482 --> 25:05.379
- You know?

25:05.448 --> 25:07.310
- I'm the team owner, Noah.

25:07.379 --> 25:10.206
People tell me things.

25:10.275 --> 25:11.620
I asked Lionel about it.

25:11.689 --> 25:14.551
I guess she didn't know,
and she killed it.

25:14.620 --> 25:17.655
- You sabotaged my job offer?

25:19.103 --> 25:20.724
Look, it was--
it was a bad mistake.

25:20.793 --> 25:23.517
I didn't mean to cost you
your opportunity.

25:23.586 --> 25:25.448
- You didn't.

25:25.517 --> 25:27.655
I already turned it down.

25:29.517 --> 25:31.620
- Noah, I'm sorry--

25:31.689 --> 25:34.206
- We're done here.

25:42.275 --> 25:44.862
- I wanted to tell you,
Eve, I swear,

25:44.931 --> 25:47.551
but I didn't know how.

25:47.620 --> 25:50.137
Every time I went to,

25:50.206 --> 25:52.793
I felt like I was gonna
hurt you all over again.

25:52.862 --> 25:55.137
- So you slept with me instead.

25:55.206 --> 25:58.137
- I slept with you because
of how I felt about you.

25:58.206 --> 25:59.241
I didn't plan it.

25:59.310 --> 26:02.482
I didn't plan any of it,
I promise.

26:05.896 --> 26:07.793
I went to see your mom
that night

26:07.862 --> 26:10.448
to stop her from hurting
a lot of people.

26:12.000 --> 26:14.137
I don't wanna see you
do the same.

26:14.206 --> 26:15.862
- Or what?

26:15.931 --> 26:18.724
You'll kill me too?

26:18.793 --> 26:20.965
- I'm not a killer.

26:21.034 --> 26:23.827
- No, you're a success.

26:23.896 --> 26:26.103
You're about to win a title,

26:26.172 --> 26:27.310
you...

26:27.379 --> 26:29.586
and all the people
in that arena

26:29.655 --> 26:32.275
who covered for you.

26:32.344 --> 26:33.862
Guess what?

26:33.931 --> 26:36.793
I'm not gonna let that happen.

26:36.862 --> 26:39.448
How's that drink, German?

26:45.379 --> 26:47.620
Relax.

26:47.689 --> 26:50.241
I'm not a murderer.

26:50.310 --> 26:51.689
That's you.

26:55.275 --> 26:57.620
I'm so much worse.

26:59.068 --> 27:00.896
You were the one thing

27:00.965 --> 27:03.551
making me go easy.

27:03.620 --> 27:07.344
Now you're the thing that's
gonna make me go even harder.

27:33.586 --> 27:36.206
- Time for one more?

27:36.275 --> 27:38.137
- Absolutely.

27:41.206 --> 27:43.000
Have a seat.

27:49.137 --> 27:51.068
Welcome, London Scott.

27:51.137 --> 27:53.206
I've been waiting
all day to ask:

27:53.275 --> 27:55.310
What does being
a Devil Girl mean to you?

27:56.482 --> 27:58.344
- Salvation.

27:59.413 --> 28:01.413
- Salvation?

28:01.482 --> 28:03.310
- A few months ago,

28:03.379 --> 28:04.758
I had nowhere to go.

28:04.827 --> 28:07.344
No one wanted me,

28:07.413 --> 28:08.689
until the Devil Girls.

28:08.758 --> 28:12.103
I now get to dance,
choreograph,

28:12.172 --> 28:14.448
be a part of something bigger.

28:14.517 --> 28:16.344
I get to be me again...

28:17.724 --> 28:19.655
But with experiences
I can use now

28:19.724 --> 28:20.862
to create bigger things.

28:20.931 --> 28:23.241
- Speaking of experiences...

28:23.310 --> 28:26.000
- People know all about
the headlines...

28:27.655 --> 28:29.793
A sex scandal with a holy man.

28:29.862 --> 28:31.448
I'm a home-wrecker.

28:31.517 --> 28:33.758
A heathen.

28:33.827 --> 28:34.827
A whore.

28:36.482 --> 28:40.724
But the truth that
everyone leaves out

28:40.793 --> 28:43.793
is that I was in love,

28:43.862 --> 28:47.206
and I got my heart broken,

28:47.275 --> 28:49.758
and when you're heartbroken,

28:49.827 --> 28:53.000
it's like the world is dead.

28:53.068 --> 28:56.862
Scorched like nothing
could ever grow there

28:56.931 --> 28:59.310
ever again.

28:59.379 --> 29:01.862
- Do you think it's possible
that it could?

29:04.724 --> 29:06.068
London?

29:06.137 --> 29:07.689
Do you think
you could love again?

29:10.793 --> 29:12.517
- Yeah.

29:35.413 --> 29:37.068
- Do you always walk around
like that?

29:37.137 --> 29:39.793
- I had an interview
with "Du Monde" magazine.

29:39.862 --> 29:41.620
- How was that?

29:41.689 --> 29:43.931
- It was tough,

29:44.000 --> 29:45.896
but it showed me something.

29:48.172 --> 29:51.137
I was wrong to push you away.

29:51.206 --> 29:53.310
When I was at my lowest,

29:53.379 --> 29:56.655
I never thought
there'd come a time

29:56.724 --> 29:58.862
that I'd feel something again,

29:58.931 --> 30:00.655
anything...

30:02.827 --> 30:05.206
But I did...

30:05.275 --> 30:06.793
with you.

30:06.862 --> 30:08.758
That means something.

30:10.379 --> 30:12.793
- Well, I mean, if it was
so easy to give up...

30:12.862 --> 30:14.413
- It wasn't easy,

30:14.482 --> 30:18.896
just like it's not easy being
right here right now with you,

30:18.965 --> 30:21.379
hoping you'll give me
a second chance.

30:21.448 --> 30:22.931
But here I am.

30:25.896 --> 30:27.793
He took...

30:27.862 --> 30:30.620
too much from me.

30:32.379 --> 30:35.655
I can't let him take this too,

30:35.724 --> 30:37.620
not without a fight.

30:37.689 --> 30:40.413
- You're the first person
I felt anything with

30:40.482 --> 30:42.586
after...

30:44.275 --> 30:45.965
But what if we're
just rebounds?

30:46.034 --> 30:47.965
- Sometimes...

30:48.034 --> 30:51.724
rebounds are the shots
you're supposed to take.

30:51.793 --> 30:53.931
- You wanna take this shot?

30:56.413 --> 30:57.793
- Yeah.

30:57.862 --> 30:59.482
- You scared?

31:00.896 --> 31:02.724
I'm terrified.

31:11.241 --> 31:13.068
- Thank God the AC kicked in
when it did,

31:13.137 --> 31:14.655
or we would have
burst into flames.

31:14.724 --> 31:17.413
- Water?

31:20.275 --> 31:21.310
Mmm.

31:21.379 --> 31:22.586
Now that we're talking again,

31:22.655 --> 31:24.931
I can tell you
the real reason I'm back.

31:25.000 --> 31:27.586
- Oh, here we go.
What'd you do now?

31:32.896 --> 31:36.275
Is...that...um...

31:36.344 --> 31:38.482
- It is.

31:38.551 --> 31:40.068
Uh...

31:40.137 --> 31:42.689
will you marry me, Kyle Hart?

31:46.586 --> 31:49.137
- Yes.

31:49.206 --> 31:50.724
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

31:50.793 --> 31:52.620
- Wow.

31:52.689 --> 31:54.620
- Uh-huh.

32:07.379 --> 32:09.758
These karats look
so good on me.

32:09.827 --> 32:12.137
Um, who am I kidding,
all karats look good on me.

32:12.206 --> 32:13.896
Oh, I could swim in 'em.

32:13.965 --> 32:15.620
Being loaded is the best.

32:15.689 --> 32:17.103
- Oh, we're loaded?

32:17.172 --> 32:20.206
- Well, what's yours
is mine now.

32:20.275 --> 32:23.620
- No, no, no,
I--I'm not loaded, I'm broke.

32:23.689 --> 32:25.068
- Stop playing.

32:25.137 --> 32:26.965
Outside, you said
you had money.

32:27.034 --> 32:29.137
- No, no, no, I said,
"What if I had money?"

32:29.206 --> 32:32.137
I was being hypothetical,
not literal.

32:32.206 --> 32:35.034
I said, like,
13 things to you outside.

32:35.103 --> 32:36.517
- Well, I stopped listening
after that.

32:36.586 --> 32:38.896
- I didn't wanna come back
empty-handed.

32:38.965 --> 32:41.241
That's why it took me so long.

32:41.310 --> 32:43.655
Another six months, maybe
I could've scored a big payday,

32:43.724 --> 32:46.724
but...I couldn't stay away
from you a day longer,

32:46.793 --> 32:48.586
so I quit...

32:48.655 --> 32:50.758
with just enough
to buy this ring.

32:53.206 --> 32:57.000
All you need is love, huh?

32:57.068 --> 32:58.793
- Mm-hmm.

33:00.137 --> 33:02.068
- Long time, no see.

33:02.137 --> 33:03.344
"Du Monde" is about to unveil

33:03.413 --> 33:04.655
the cover girl
in the Playground.

33:04.724 --> 33:05.655
Come with?

33:05.724 --> 33:07.862
And then after, maybe...

33:07.931 --> 33:09.827
dessert?

33:09.896 --> 33:12.206
- Look, I, um--

33:12.275 --> 33:14.862
I think you're amazing,
unstoppable,

33:14.931 --> 33:17.586
and talented as hell...

33:17.655 --> 33:18.689
- But?

33:18.758 --> 33:21.206
- But I started something,

33:21.275 --> 33:23.034
and I need to see it through.

33:24.793 --> 33:27.000
- I know this play.

33:27.068 --> 33:30.172
It's for London.

33:30.241 --> 33:31.965
- I--I'm sorry if this--

33:32.034 --> 33:34.241
- Let's not do this.

33:34.310 --> 33:35.896
I'm not that girl.

33:35.965 --> 33:37.310
We had fun.

33:37.379 --> 33:39.827
Now you wanna have fun
with someone else.

33:39.896 --> 33:42.034
So, go.

33:42.103 --> 33:44.034
Have fun.

33:58.724 --> 34:01.241
- What the hell
did she do to you?

34:02.965 --> 34:04.517
- It's not what she did to me.

34:04.586 --> 34:06.310
It's what I did to her.

34:06.379 --> 34:08.655
And now everything is worse.

34:10.068 --> 34:11.862
- What could you have
possibly done

34:11.931 --> 34:13.586
to make this worse?

34:19.724 --> 34:23.586
- Raquel wasn't there
the night Olivia died.

34:23.655 --> 34:25.965
I was.

34:26.034 --> 34:27.862
Raquel covered for me.

34:33.965 --> 34:35.793
- Olivia pushed you that hard?

34:42.586 --> 34:45.724
- Derek and Kyle knew.

34:45.793 --> 34:47.655
Eve find out.

34:50.517 --> 34:53.206
She's not gonna stop
until she takes us all down.

34:59.000 --> 35:00.379
- When I was sitting
in that chair,

35:00.448 --> 35:03.034
I dressed a little better
than that.

35:03.965 --> 35:05.965
- Well, you're not sitting
in that chair...

35:09.827 --> 35:11.517
I am.

35:12.586 --> 35:14.137
Am I gonna have
to call security?

35:15.551 --> 35:18.103
Ah, that won't be necessary.

35:18.172 --> 35:19.758
I'm in town, because...

35:19.827 --> 35:23.241
Eve Vincent found a buyer for
a piece of property of mine,

35:23.310 --> 35:25.379
one that would be perfect
for another team

35:25.448 --> 35:27.448
to--to move right into,

35:27.517 --> 35:29.655
replacing the Devils.

35:29.724 --> 35:31.620
- If you can't have it,
no one can.

35:31.689 --> 35:34.137
- In attempting
to broker this deal,

35:34.206 --> 35:36.448
Eve is in direct violation

35:36.517 --> 35:38.275
of League ethics rules.

35:38.344 --> 35:39.896
The minute you inform
the League,

35:39.965 --> 35:41.620
they'll handcuff her.

35:41.689 --> 35:43.482
She'll be out of your hair.

35:43.551 --> 35:44.931
- That would blow the deal.

35:45.000 --> 35:47.379
- I'm not taking the deal.

35:47.448 --> 35:50.000
I'm giving you the tool
to take down Eve.

35:52.034 --> 35:53.931
And why would you do that?

35:54.000 --> 35:56.413
- When I was with Eve,

35:56.482 --> 36:00.137
I saw a familiar look
in her eye,

36:00.206 --> 36:02.793
one I know all too well.

36:04.620 --> 36:06.862
I don't see that
in your eyes...

36:08.413 --> 36:10.413
And I don't want to.

36:15.965 --> 36:17.206
Good luck, son.

36:26.551 --> 36:28.137
- The "Du Monde" cover girl
will be announced

36:28.206 --> 36:29.137
in just a few minutes.

36:29.206 --> 36:31.724
- Have you seen Kyle?

36:44.965 --> 36:48.724
- I'm sorry I sabotaged
your job offer.

36:51.241 --> 36:53.310
It's too easy to be that guy,

36:53.379 --> 36:56.862
and, well, I don't wanna be,

36:56.931 --> 36:59.206
so I pulled some strings

36:59.275 --> 37:02.137
and kissed some major ass
and I got it back for you.

37:04.068 --> 37:05.793
- I'm not taking it.

37:07.310 --> 37:09.413
- After what I did,

37:09.482 --> 37:11.137
why would you stay?

37:11.206 --> 37:12.551
- For you.

37:15.586 --> 37:16.689
- I don't want you
to resent me.

37:16.758 --> 37:18.000
This is a great opportunity--

37:18.068 --> 37:21.310
- You can never do
anything like that again--

37:21.379 --> 37:23.965
go behind my back,
keep secrets.

37:24.034 --> 37:27.000
I need to be able
to trust my boyfriend.

37:28.655 --> 37:30.137
Did you just call me
your boyfriend?

37:30.206 --> 37:32.896
- I'm not being cute, Jude.

37:32.965 --> 37:36.172
My last boyfriend was
stage four and didn't tell me.

37:37.931 --> 37:39.931
- He was taken from me
without a goodbye.

37:46.724 --> 37:48.758
- Why didn't he tell you?

37:48.827 --> 37:50.758
He didn't think
you could handle it?

37:53.103 --> 37:54.586
- I was his happy guy.

37:56.482 --> 37:59.551
- He wanted that for himself.

37:59.620 --> 38:01.758
He wanted that for me.

38:17.241 --> 38:18.965
- Can I have everyone's
attention please?

38:19.034 --> 38:20.827
Thank you.

38:20.896 --> 38:22.965
It's been a day
for revelations.

38:23.034 --> 38:24.724
Now, this is--
this is just a mockup,

38:24.793 --> 38:28.103
but it is the image
we'll feature on our cover.

38:28.172 --> 38:32.827
It truly captures
the Devil Girl spirit.

38:47.310 --> 38:48.758
You like it?

38:48.827 --> 38:50.586
- I love it.

38:50.655 --> 38:52.000
No scandal here.

38:52.068 --> 38:53.758
- Your version of
the story's better.

38:53.827 --> 38:55.206
I'm glad you told it.

38:55.275 --> 38:57.379
- Thank you.

38:57.448 --> 38:59.206
- Congratulations.

38:59.275 --> 39:01.241
Your focus is paying off.

39:05.206 --> 39:06.896
- Hey.

39:06.965 --> 39:09.034
I got your text. What's wrong?
- Eve update.

39:09.103 --> 39:11.275
She's dialing
her rampage to ten.

39:11.344 --> 39:13.482
- Not possible.
I snapped her dial off.

39:13.551 --> 39:14.793
- What? How?

39:14.862 --> 39:17.034
- With a little help...

39:17.103 --> 39:19.000
from Oscar.

39:19.068 --> 39:21.965
- Why would he do that?
- For me.

39:23.724 --> 39:25.517
- Warren...

39:25.586 --> 39:27.655
Warren!

39:28.655 --> 39:31.172
I was doing what we both want.

39:31.241 --> 39:33.344
You--you do have a choice.

39:46.034 --> 39:48.172
- Does that offer still stand?

39:50.068 --> 39:51.448
- Come in.

40:00.310 --> 40:01.448
- Next time on
"Hit the Floor"...

40:01.517 --> 40:02.448
- I need dirt on someone.

40:02.517 --> 40:03.758
- I'll do this for you,

40:03.827 --> 40:05.862
but you have
to do something for me.

40:05.931 --> 40:07.172
- What do you want me to do?

40:07.241 --> 40:10.896
- It involves Jude Kinkade
and Derek Roman.

40:10.965 --> 40:12.896
- Somebody would be a fool
to admit to that.

40:12.965 --> 40:14.689
- Somebody would be
a fool to lie.

40:14.758 --> 40:16.724
- You ready?
- I am, yeah.

40:16.793 --> 40:18.241
Kyle?
Not so sure.

40:18.310 --> 40:20.448
- I'm never gonna have sex
with another man again.
