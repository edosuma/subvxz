00:49.125 --> 00:53.159
Marguerite and Julien de Ravalet
lived very long ago.

00:53.249 --> 00:56.124
This film is loosely based
on their story.

01:15.040 --> 01:17.748
<i>Julien, I'll always love you.</i>

01:19.206 --> 01:20.497
<i>Me too.</i>

01:35.872 --> 01:38.656
Juliette said JosÃ©phine saw them.

01:38.746 --> 01:40.787
No! Mathilde saw them.

01:41.245 --> 01:43.738
A blue dress, her hair down.

01:43.828 --> 01:46.737
No, Juliette said she had pants

01:46.827 --> 01:48.111
and short hair.

01:48.201 --> 01:49.694
- No way!
- I swear!

01:49.784 --> 01:51.318
She even saw them kiss.

01:51.408 --> 01:52.651
Wild sex, I bet.

01:52.741 --> 01:53.824
Like this

01:54.990 --> 01:56.531
Yeah, like that.

02:09.139 --> 02:10.723
What is it, virgins?

02:10.812 --> 02:11.779
Quiet!

02:13.404 --> 02:15.279
Why are you so worked up?

02:16.154 --> 02:17.897
Marguerite and Julien.

02:17.987 --> 02:19.945
They're supposedly in town.

03:20.528 --> 03:22.236
Marguerite! Julien!

03:22.569 --> 03:23.527
Come back!

03:36.943 --> 03:39.977
<i>Marguerite and Julien are siblings.
He's older.</i>

03:40.067 --> 03:43.192
<i>Born in Tourlaville
in a splendid chateau.</i>

03:43.775 --> 03:46.809
<i>In the chateau,
servants for meals</i>

03:46.899 --> 03:48.774
<i>chambermaids for bedtime.</i>

03:49.315 --> 03:50.398
Night, dear.

03:55.356 --> 03:57.349
<i>The estate was immense.</i>

03:57.439 --> 04:01.515
<i>A tropical greenhouse,
rare plants from all over the world.</i>

04:01.605 --> 04:04.313
Everyday, brioche for breakfast.

04:05.521 --> 04:07.764
In the morning,
classes at the chateau.

04:07.854 --> 04:10.604
The rest of the day, they could play.

04:15.395 --> 04:17.346
<i>Julien adored his sister.</i>

04:17.435 --> 04:20.269
<i>He would stare at her
for hours on end.</i>

04:20.601 --> 04:23.018
<i>She was more precious than a diamond.</i>

04:24.643 --> 04:26.518
Can I have the pink?

04:30.851 --> 04:33.267
<i>He drew her and enjoyed it.</i>

04:34.433 --> 04:36.676
<i>Marguerite was a perfect model.</i>

04:36.766 --> 04:39.217
<i>Her melancholy grace was charming.</i>

04:39.307 --> 04:40.973
Raise your chin.

04:42.639 --> 04:43.847
Julien

04:44.305 --> 04:47.138
will you love me when we're grown up?

04:47.596 --> 04:49.304
I'll always love you.

04:52.137 --> 04:56.088
I read palms.
My sister wanted hers read.

04:56.178 --> 04:57.212
<i>At night</i>

04:57.302 --> 05:01.010
<i>they stayed up and put on shows
to amuse their parents.</i>

05:02.468 --> 05:05.384
<i>He's a bandit! To the dungeon.</i>

05:08.967 --> 05:09.960
<i>Lucky them.</i>

05:10.050 --> 05:12.966
<i>Parents, real parents,
whom they loved.</i>

05:13.299 --> 05:14.333
<i>A brother too.</i>

05:14.423 --> 05:16.256
<i>May I go see him?</i>

05:17.131 --> 05:18.297
<i>Yes.</i>

05:18.547 --> 05:21.588
<i>You may speak through the bars.
5 minutes.</i>

05:21.963 --> 05:24.713
<i>More than enough time
to say farewell.</i>

05:25.754 --> 05:29.712
<i>Julian, it all could have been
so different for us.</i>

05:30.337 --> 05:32.628
<i>If you just could break free.</i>

05:34.086 --> 05:35.627
<i>It's impossible.</i>

05:37.002 --> 05:38.585
<i>I'll love you always.</i>

05:41.626 --> 05:42.751
<i>Margaret.</i>

05:52.167 --> 05:53.375
Jean...

05:54.166 --> 05:58.416
Marguerite's presence in class
is not good for the boys.

05:59.207 --> 06:00.373
Why not?

06:00.706 --> 06:02.372
It's important to...

06:02.997 --> 06:04.872
set certain limits.

06:05.497 --> 06:08.781
Women have homes to keep,
husbands to please

06:08.871 --> 06:10.405
children to rear.

06:10.495 --> 06:12.078
School is not for them.

06:14.661 --> 06:17.119
We're of a different mind, Uncle.

06:18.119 --> 06:20.028
We open the portals of knowledge

06:20.118 --> 06:22.944
to servants' and farmers' children.

06:23.034 --> 06:26.450
Stop these verbal games,
this endless battle.

06:27.991 --> 06:31.900
Generosity and sharing are in my realm.
You know it.

06:31.990 --> 06:33.524
Why not?

06:33.614 --> 06:35.440
I'm open-minded.

06:35.530 --> 06:39.405
I let you manage the family fortune,
with a free hand.

06:40.821 --> 06:41.862
True.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.070
That's not the problem.

06:47.611 --> 06:49.277
The real problem

06:51.527 --> 06:53.152
is Marguerite.

06:54.402 --> 06:57.443
I fear she is leading Julien astray.

06:58.901 --> 07:00.026
Jean...

07:01.026 --> 07:02.602
you must separate them.

07:02.692 --> 07:03.775
Trust me.

07:04.316 --> 07:06.691
The boys should be in school.

07:14.941 --> 07:16.066
Julien...

07:18.691 --> 07:22.191
Let's go and see Pegasus.
No one will see.

07:23.316 --> 07:24.566
Come!

08:35.691 --> 08:36.774
Pegasus.

09:09.815 --> 09:10.981
Pegasus!

09:17.231 --> 09:18.481
Julien!

09:34.731 --> 09:36.022
Marguerite!

09:38.313 --> 09:39.646
Help!

09:47.896 --> 09:49.104
Julien!

10:02.145 --> 10:03.436
Lord help her.

10:10.102 --> 10:11.602
Give me your hand!

10:13.710 --> 10:15.043
Your hand!

10:41.518 --> 10:43.101
Come on, children.

11:09.726 --> 11:10.809
Julien!

11:14.600 --> 11:17.350
Get dressed.
They're waiting downstairs.

11:18.183 --> 11:19.641
My boys...

11:20.516 --> 11:24.307
time to put aside the preciousness
of life at home.

11:24.932 --> 11:26.640
And your childish games.

11:27.015 --> 11:30.174
You must now learn to behave seriously

11:30.264 --> 11:31.430
in society.

11:33.513 --> 11:35.971
You're off to boarding school.

11:38.304 --> 11:39.729
It's a long ride.

11:40.054 --> 11:41.137
Let's go.

12:00.137 --> 12:03.928
<i>Marguerite and Julien are separated
for many years.</i>

12:08.553 --> 12:10.886
<i>She learns to live far from him</i>

12:10.961 --> 12:12.386
<i>and he from her.</i>

12:14.177 --> 12:18.760
The hungry wolf does listen,
his teary eyes do glisten.

12:19.051 --> 12:21.919
He asks the dog
about the spot on his neck.

12:22.009 --> 12:24.675
A tiny speck.
It doesn't pain me.

12:27.050 --> 12:31.168
Comes from the collar
with which they chain me.

12:31.258 --> 12:34.674
Jacqueline,
when will I see Julien again?

12:35.924 --> 12:37.049
Soon.

12:37.465 --> 12:38.781
Yes, but when?

12:38.856 --> 12:40.422
When school is over.

12:45.755 --> 12:46.921
Goodnight.

12:51.171 --> 12:52.580
<i>But after school,</i>

12:52.670 --> 12:55.788
<i>Julien and Philippe
studied art in Italy</i>

12:55.878 --> 12:57.829
<i>finance in England,</i>

12:57.919 --> 12:59.912
<i>weaponry in Germany.</i>

13:00.002 --> 13:03.168
<i>And finally, Paris, to learn about life.</i>

13:12.251 --> 13:14.751
<i>Meanwhile, Marguerite grew up.</i>

13:15.376 --> 13:19.410
<i>Long past the marrying age,
she refuses every suitor</i>

13:19.500 --> 13:21.583
<i>to her parents' despair.</i>

13:22.624 --> 13:23.790
Marguerite!

13:35.206 --> 13:36.497
A lot of pain?

13:36.997 --> 13:38.955
It stopped a few days ago.

13:42.038 --> 13:45.288
You needn't have bothered
to get out of bed.

13:49.538 --> 13:51.079
I prefer to be here.

13:52.245 --> 13:53.661
Bed bores me.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.702
You're some expert.

13:58.827 --> 14:01.577
- Want to try?
- Yes, it looks fun.

14:04.785 --> 14:07.076
Wait, I'll show you how.

14:11.784 --> 14:13.450
Gently, flat out.

14:19.241 --> 14:20.324
Here.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.699
No, this one is pretty.

14:29.740 --> 14:31.531
You should keep it.

14:35.114 --> 14:36.655
<i>Having crossed oceans</i>

14:37.280 --> 14:39.481
seas and rivers

14:39.571 --> 14:43.946
having crossed plains, valleys
and every mountain

14:44.654 --> 14:48.480
having travelled the world
10 times, 100 times

14:48.570 --> 14:49.828
1,000 times...

14:52.361 --> 14:54.361
they went back to the chateau.

14:55.819 --> 14:56.985
At a gallop!

15:16.276 --> 15:17.817
Have my brothers come?

15:18.275 --> 15:20.733
- Where are they?
- North tower.

16:02.941 --> 16:04.274
My Julien...

16:51.833 --> 16:53.416
You wear cologne?

16:54.624 --> 16:56.124
You smell different.

17:05.999 --> 17:07.075
Who is she?

17:07.165 --> 17:08.248
The widow.

17:08.623 --> 17:09.772
What widow?

17:09.873 --> 17:12.539
A young widow we see in Paris.

17:13.497 --> 17:14.797
Go to the Court?

17:14.880 --> 17:15.989
Give it back.

17:16.079 --> 17:17.113
See the King?

17:17.203 --> 17:18.453
He likes Uncle.

17:18.828 --> 17:19.945
And the King?

17:20.036 --> 17:21.202
Give it back.

17:22.327 --> 17:24.160
- Give it to me!
- Take it.

17:25.492 --> 17:26.867
She's hideous.

17:27.201 --> 17:28.659
Less pretty than you.

17:31.159 --> 17:32.450
Hello, Philippe.

17:37.908 --> 17:39.533
You're country stock.

18:24.991 --> 18:27.400
<i>They imagined a life of love</i>

18:27.490 --> 18:30.816
<i>fertile enough to fill vast solitude</i>

18:30.906 --> 18:33.649
<i>overflowing with joy,
braving adversity</i>

18:33.739 --> 18:35.822
<i>resplendent and lofty</i>

18:36.322 --> 18:38.065
<i>like the pulsing of stars.</i>

18:38.155 --> 18:40.571
<i>He contemplated her diaphanous skin</i>

18:40.987 --> 18:42.445
<i>her fingers</i>

18:42.820 --> 18:44.986
<i>each one more than a thing</i>

18:45.611 --> 18:47.361
<i>almost a person.</i>

18:50.944 --> 18:52.902
Paris is huge, gorgeous.

18:53.443 --> 18:56.651
Fearsome too, dirty,
dangerous, full of temptations.

18:57.067 --> 19:00.060
Father, you're overdoing it
or overtired.

19:00.150 --> 19:02.191
You're no stranger to Paris!

19:02.482 --> 19:04.641
Philippe, don't be presumptuous.

19:04.731 --> 19:07.474
I hope we haven't grown apart,

19:07.564 --> 19:09.182
and I won't consider

19:09.272 --> 19:11.556
your education a mistake.

19:11.646 --> 19:12.972
No mistakes.

19:13.062 --> 19:15.728
Just incomplete or inadequate ideas.

19:16.061 --> 19:19.595
What's inadequate is the use
you make of your learning.

19:19.685 --> 19:23.268
Don't forget
we don't study to show off knowledge,

19:23.601 --> 19:25.385
but to make life easier.

19:25.475 --> 19:27.183
That's what knowledge is for.

19:27.558 --> 19:29.058
It comes from all over.

19:29.599 --> 19:31.390
It's there, waiting.

20:00.723 --> 20:01.889
Smile a bit.

20:03.889 --> 20:05.097
Look at me.

20:07.013 --> 20:09.096
I preferred when you drew me.

20:11.387 --> 20:14.678
Father wants your portrait.
I'm obeying.

20:28.386 --> 20:29.761
Raise your chin.

20:49.802 --> 20:51.343
Do you still love me?

20:58.301 --> 21:01.967
Marguerite, a visitor.
Marigny is in the parlor.

21:08.842 --> 21:11.425
Hurry.
He's been waiting a while.

21:16.008 --> 21:17.799
He came just for you.

22:17.882 --> 22:18.965
One...

22:19.631 --> 22:20.589
two...

22:20.964 --> 22:21.922
three...

23:29.963 --> 23:31.046
Was I wrong?

23:31.504 --> 23:33.379
Your parents are relieved.

23:33.712 --> 23:36.163
I just find it a bit quick.

23:36.253 --> 23:37.461
You said to wed.

23:37.836 --> 23:39.711
Not the first comer.

23:45.586 --> 23:47.252
Want to know the truth?

23:49.418 --> 23:53.876
I accepted because I read
that jealous men are in love.

23:54.834 --> 23:56.000
And so?

23:58.291 --> 23:59.416
So...

24:05.374 --> 24:06.624
So nothing.

24:28.957 --> 24:30.623
Speak, Julien.

24:36.789 --> 24:38.039
Is all well?

24:42.330 --> 24:43.788
You know

24:44.954 --> 24:47.079
you can speak without fear.

24:48.995 --> 24:50.245
You know that.

25:02.745 --> 25:03.953
Go on.

25:19.369 --> 25:20.785
Go on, Julien.

25:29.493 --> 25:31.444
I worry about Marguerite.

25:31.534 --> 25:32.617
Why?

25:35.158 --> 25:36.408
I don't know.

25:37.408 --> 25:38.533
You do.

25:39.408 --> 25:40.866
You know full well.

25:48.407 --> 25:51.657
I can't bear her marrying this Marigny.

26:00.490 --> 26:02.441
It's a masquerade.

26:02.531 --> 26:03.489
Really?

26:04.072 --> 26:05.405
You think so?

26:17.780 --> 26:19.071
Marigny

26:20.487 --> 26:22.737
will make her a good husband.

26:25.362 --> 26:27.362
You mustn't worry about that.

26:34.028 --> 26:35.403
Listen to me.

26:36.528 --> 26:39.153
The best way to avoid sin

26:39.486 --> 26:41.569
is to flee temptation.

26:45.110 --> 26:46.151
Read this.

26:50.401 --> 26:51.609
Out loud.

26:55.150 --> 26:57.684
"I am not intelligent, sire.â

26:57.774 --> 27:00.350
"I am but a poor village girlâ

27:00.440 --> 27:01.481
"one of many.â

27:02.314 --> 27:06.480
"But when something is black,
I can't say it's white."

28:26.313 --> 28:28.313
Did you know
that animals know pity?

28:28.771 --> 28:29.764
Do they?

28:29.854 --> 28:31.645
Well, they feel it.

28:40.145 --> 28:42.478
You are the stuff of my dreams.

29:21.228 --> 29:22.644
... even dared

29:23.560 --> 29:27.053
imagining having a wife so stunning.

29:27.143 --> 29:28.768
Stunning daughter.

29:29.309 --> 29:31.934
Her melancholy grace is charming.

29:47.267 --> 29:48.642
Not very hungry.

29:51.475 --> 29:53.225
I killed your appetite?

29:55.933 --> 29:56.983
Excuse me.

30:03.183 --> 30:04.641
I'll be right back.

30:20.849 --> 30:21.967
I like duck.

30:22.057 --> 30:23.973
Just grab the potatoes.

30:24.348 --> 30:28.098
You're struggling with the fork.
Just grab them.

30:38.139 --> 30:39.639
Go away, please.

31:05.097 --> 31:06.763
"I can read palms.â

31:07.179 --> 31:09.762
"My brother wanted his read.â

31:10.137 --> 31:13.095
"With my mouth I followed each lineâ

31:13.678 --> 31:15.587
"one after anotherâ

31:15.677 --> 31:17.177
"first to last."

31:20.593 --> 31:23.218
Even if I only get your crumbs

31:23.884 --> 31:25.925
I'd take them over nothing.

31:27.091 --> 31:28.299
My crumbs?

31:37.424 --> 31:38.674
What's that?

31:49.632 --> 31:50.882
Is it this?

32:01.715 --> 32:03.048
Or this?

32:15.756 --> 32:16.756
Or this?

32:27.464 --> 32:29.505
- Want to play?
- If you do.

32:31.046 --> 32:32.462
I'll go first.

32:32.962 --> 32:33.837
I choose

32:34.503 --> 32:35.961
ear, goose-bumps.

32:58.752 --> 32:59.877
I win.

33:06.168 --> 33:08.827
My turn.
I choose clever feet.

33:08.917 --> 33:11.285
You have a beautiful garden

33:11.375 --> 33:13.791
divided into several parts.

33:14.874 --> 33:18.207
There's a wonderful greenhouse.

33:19.540 --> 33:22.165
I wonder where the plants are from.

33:47.331 --> 33:48.456
I win.

33:50.539 --> 33:51.747
I choose

33:53.205 --> 33:54.580
neck, blood.

33:55.830 --> 33:57.246
How shameful.

33:58.162 --> 33:59.370
Their coats.

34:29.828 --> 34:30.994
Where are they?

34:31.284 --> 34:34.444
Julien isn't in our room.
His bed is made.

34:34.534 --> 34:35.810
And Marguerite?

34:35.900 --> 34:37.933
Not in her room either.

34:37.991 --> 34:41.067
- Too late.
- Get some men. Find them.

34:41.157 --> 34:42.197
Yes, sir.

34:50.739 --> 34:51.864
Arrow.

35:07.947 --> 35:09.231
What was it?

35:09.321 --> 35:10.446
Always.

35:12.487 --> 35:13.445
Again.

35:22.361 --> 35:23.902
- So?
- No one.

35:24.902 --> 35:26.285
The greenhouse?

35:29.860 --> 35:31.693
Let's check the attic.

35:41.818 --> 35:43.019
Sorrow.

35:43.109 --> 35:44.509
What's going on?

35:44.692 --> 35:45.983
Get dressed!

35:47.733 --> 35:49.174
They're all over!

35:51.416 --> 35:53.082
Your father is furious!

35:54.040 --> 35:55.165
If he saw you

36:04.665 --> 36:05.915
I'll explain.

36:07.956 --> 36:09.997
Why did you leave dinner?

36:10.705 --> 36:13.913
These secrets, these games!
It couldn't wait?

36:14.329 --> 36:16.370
Do you realize the affront?

36:18.578 --> 36:19.661
Sit down.

36:23.077 --> 36:24.202
My child

36:25.077 --> 36:28.035
Your mother and I
always protected you all.

36:28.951 --> 36:33.117
You've had no illnesses.
You're grown, in good health.

36:33.992 --> 36:36.325
So many children die senselessly.

36:37.325 --> 36:39.783
Accident, hunger, an epidemic.

36:42.741 --> 36:44.699
Life is precious!

36:48.199 --> 36:50.115
Growing old is a privilege.

36:50.490 --> 36:52.198
Don't deny it to yourself.

36:52.823 --> 36:54.448
Don't deny us that.

36:57.031 --> 36:58.531
I know, Father.

37:00.864 --> 37:02.307
I don't want to die.

37:02.397 --> 37:03.880
So I beg of you

37:04.071 --> 37:06.071
for the last time

37:08.404 --> 37:11.029
tell me what happened tonight.

37:12.237 --> 37:13.862
I already did.

37:15.487 --> 37:17.237
We were only playing.

37:47.120 --> 37:48.436
He's innocent.

37:48.819 --> 37:51.187
He drew her, photographed her.

37:51.277 --> 37:53.270
I asked for the photograph.

37:53.360 --> 37:56.811
He painted her.
From every angle, since childhood.

37:56.901 --> 37:58.367
That proves nothing.

37:58.458 --> 38:01.158
Julien is an artist.
You see evil everywhere.

38:04.274 --> 38:05.732
Enough, Madeleine.

38:06.607 --> 38:08.140
This is too serious.

38:09.106 --> 38:12.272
Your behavior induces them to sin.

38:13.563 --> 38:15.347
You must act.

38:15.437 --> 38:18.103
Marry Marguerite off, no matter what.

38:18.686 --> 38:20.461
Before it's too late.

38:20.519 --> 38:22.394
It won't be easy now.

38:22.935 --> 38:24.560
- Philippe.
- Leave us.

38:29.476 --> 38:30.642
Madeleine.

38:32.017 --> 38:32.975
Jean.

38:37.141 --> 38:39.391
Marguerite and Julien are sick.

38:41.474 --> 38:43.224
If we don't help them

38:44.265 --> 38:46.515
they'll rot in hell.

38:46.848 --> 38:48.056
So will we.

39:23.847 --> 39:25.763
Marguerite isn't joining us?

40:50.388 --> 40:51.971
I'm yours.

41:30.429 --> 41:31.845
I must leave.

41:38.845 --> 41:40.095
I have to.

41:41.178 --> 41:42.428
Don't leave me.

41:43.803 --> 41:46.303
We mustn't meet again. Ever.

41:47.219 --> 41:48.427
Please.

41:48.927 --> 41:50.177
Don't leave me.

41:55.218 --> 41:56.384
Don't go.

42:07.717 --> 42:09.383
I'll always love you.

42:10.716 --> 42:11.757
Always.

42:28.798 --> 42:32.173
That night,
Madame de Ravalet heard something.

42:34.631 --> 42:37.214
<i>She went to Marguerite's room, woke her</i>

42:38.422 --> 42:39.755
<i>shook her</i>

42:40.255 --> 42:42.046
<i>made her speak.</i>

42:42.837 --> 42:44.303
<i>Marguerite resisted.</i>

42:44.778 --> 42:46.037
<i>Madame de Ravalet</i>

42:46.127 --> 42:47.960
hit her as hard she could.

42:49.085 --> 42:50.426
And killed her.

42:50.559 --> 42:52.175
How terrible.

42:53.375 --> 42:54.583
It's not true.

42:54.999 --> 42:57.124
I know what happened after.

42:58.582 --> 43:01.207
Marguerite began to cry and cry.

43:02.123 --> 43:04.373
Her mother cried with her.

43:05.039 --> 43:06.664
For a long while.

43:07.539 --> 43:11.080
There was no changing it.
Like a disease.

43:11.955 --> 43:14.746
<i>Her mother consoled her in her arms.</i>

43:26.537 --> 43:27.953
<i>Marguerite spoke</i>

43:28.703 --> 43:30.328
<i>confessed everything.</i>

43:31.411 --> 43:33.536
Her mother listened, terrified.

43:35.827 --> 43:37.393
She made her swear

43:37.493 --> 43:38.909
<i>to stop everything.</i>

43:39.825 --> 43:41.241
<i>Did she swear?</i>

43:41.616 --> 43:43.157
<i>She swore.</i>

43:45.365 --> 43:46.948
<i>But it wasn't enough.</i>

43:51.989 --> 43:55.405
<i>Marguerite was forced
to wed Mr. Lefebvre</i>

43:55.988 --> 43:59.321
<i>a simple tax collector, very rich.</i>

43:59.904 --> 44:02.279
<i>The only one who'd still have her.</i>

44:44.487 --> 44:45.820
<i>I'm here.</i>

44:48.611 --> 44:49.736
<i>I see you.</i>

45:45.736 --> 45:46.902
I win.

45:48.527 --> 45:49.610
Again.

45:54.151 --> 45:55.359
Another round?

45:56.692 --> 45:58.692
I'm tired. I'll go to sleep.

45:59.650 --> 46:00.608
Goodnight.

46:13.774 --> 46:16.107
I'll go to bed. I'm tired.

46:16.732 --> 46:18.073
A little tired.

46:24.939 --> 46:26.405
See you tomorrow.

47:17.105 --> 47:20.230
<i>My Julien,
I am a prisoner here in Valognes.</i>

47:20.521 --> 47:23.104
<i>They try to separate us, but can't.</i>

47:23.395 --> 47:25.304
<i>We are blood and vein</i>

47:25.394 --> 47:28.428
<i>tree and sap, salt and sea.</i>

47:28.518 --> 47:29.851
<i>Julien, my brother.</i>

47:30.142 --> 47:33.767
<i>I have something awful to say.
I think I hate life.</i>

47:35.350 --> 47:36.550
<i>I want to die.</i>

47:36.641 --> 47:37.842
<i>I suffocate.</i>

47:37.932 --> 47:39.591
<i>Every day is torture.</i>

47:39.681 --> 47:42.424
<i>Only you keep me alive,</i>

47:42.514 --> 47:44.680
<i>the hope of seeing you again.</i>

47:45.513 --> 47:47.131
<i>Julien, I love you so.</i>

47:47.221 --> 47:49.471
<i>Impossible to live without you.</i>

47:49.846 --> 47:52.221
<i>I just want to see you, hold you.</i>

47:53.512 --> 47:56.345
<i>How I'd give myself to you, if I could.</i>

47:57.511 --> 48:01.004
<i>Take me away
and do with me as you wish.</i>

48:01.094 --> 48:03.302
<i>I am forever yours, my love.</i>

48:05.093 --> 48:07.843
<i>My sister,
I must speak to you or I'll die.</i>

48:08.509 --> 48:12.377
<i>I'm sorry I left you
in this hateful situation.</i>

48:12.467 --> 48:15.918
<i>I know now that fate guides me,
not desire.</i>

48:16.008 --> 48:18.466
<i>I've tried to comprehend our hurt</i>

48:19.366 --> 48:20.642
<i>to examine it.</i>

48:20.732 --> 48:22.966
<i>My prayers make heaven weary.</i>

48:23.056 --> 48:26.165
<i>I sought solace
in wisdom and knowledge</i>

48:26.255 --> 48:27.838
<i>to no avail.</i>

48:28.254 --> 48:30.455
<i>That night was a conflagration</i>

48:30.545 --> 48:31.928
<i>an illumination.</i>

48:32.461 --> 48:35.752
<i>The harder I struggle,
the more I love you.</i>

48:47.418 --> 48:49.744
<i>Do not rouse their suspicion.</i>

48:49.834 --> 48:52.250
<i>Take no risks. Be docile.</i>

48:52.500 --> 48:55.951
<i>Accept what they say.
Do like me: pretend.</i>

48:56.041 --> 48:57.909
<i>What matters most</i>

48:57.999 --> 49:00.665
<i>is to stay alive,
for we shall meet.</i>

49:00.998 --> 49:03.623
<i>That day will be a blessing.</i>

49:03.914 --> 49:07.615
<i>I do as you say,
act pleasantly with my husband.</i>

49:07.705 --> 49:09.531
<i>My life here is gloomy.</i>

49:09.621 --> 49:11.371
<i>I am in a vise.</i>

49:11.704 --> 49:13.780
<i>I refuse his advances.</i>

49:13.870 --> 49:15.203
<i>I live in fear</i>

49:15.286 --> 49:17.112
<i>fear that he comes near.</i>

49:17.202 --> 49:18.986
<i>His gaze sullies me.</i>

49:19.076 --> 49:20.351
<i>I despise him.</i>

49:20.409 --> 49:22.485
<i>His mother is so mean</i>

49:22.575 --> 49:24.033
<i>My sister</i>

49:24.491 --> 49:27.567
<i>your strength overwhelms me.
I feel helpless.</i>

49:27.657 --> 49:29.223
<i>I am beside you.</i>

49:29.323 --> 49:31.316
<i>I'll save you from hell.</i>

49:31.406 --> 49:34.072
Even burnt, his letters stay with me.

49:34.530 --> 49:36.023
When I die, they will.

49:36.113 --> 49:37.654
<i>I'll keep writing.</i>

49:38.487 --> 49:41.771
<i>Wherever you are, I will find you.</i>

49:41.861 --> 49:44.236
You should be more wary.

49:46.986 --> 49:50.277
<i>Marguerite and Julien loved each other.
Lefebvre languished.</i>

49:51.360 --> 49:53.728
<i>His unrequited desire grew</i>

49:53.818 --> 49:54.901
<i>and grew</i>

49:55.359 --> 49:56.484
<i>and grew.</i>

49:57.650 --> 50:00.150
<i>He started seeing loose women.</i>

50:03.566 --> 50:04.774
<i>Soon enough</i>

50:04.958 --> 50:07.874
<i>rumor had it
his wife refused him in bed.</i>

50:09.915 --> 50:11.915
<i>Local laughing-stock.</i>

50:12.331 --> 50:14.199
Even his mother mocked.

50:14.289 --> 50:15.872
<i>You're too sentimental.</i>

50:17.122 --> 50:17.997
Idiot!

50:22.997 --> 50:25.955
Romance with your brother
is not freedom.

50:27.288 --> 50:29.871
What a disaster if word got out!

50:30.829 --> 50:33.870
I'm allowed.
I can write my brother.

50:37.786 --> 50:40.737
<i>Despite the fear, the loneliness.</i>

50:40.827 --> 50:43.952
<i>Marguerite survived
thanks to his letters.</i>

50:45.118 --> 50:46.534
She waited for him.

50:48.075 --> 50:49.366
Wishing.

50:51.157 --> 50:54.615
This small link between them
kept her alive.

51:09.906 --> 51:10.906
Jacqueline!

51:11.656 --> 51:12.822
Grab her!

51:39.738 --> 51:40.689
<i>And then?</i>

51:40.779 --> 51:41.904
What happened?

51:57.154 --> 51:58.529
Where's Jacqueline?

52:09.445 --> 52:10.861
I want Jacqueline.

52:13.111 --> 52:14.819
A letter for you.

52:31.277 --> 52:32.485
Not opening it?

52:46.860 --> 52:48.193
Read it!

52:54.276 --> 52:55.769
Louder!

52:55.859 --> 52:56.893
I can't hear.

52:56.983 --> 53:00.566
"Dear daughter,
I write to you with a heavy heart.

53:02.024 --> 53:04.857
"Your husband told us
what you've done.

53:08.940 --> 53:12.023
"Jacqueline, your accomplice

53:12.481 --> 53:14.189
"has been fired.

53:15.147 --> 53:17.022
"You know we love you.

53:17.438 --> 53:19.063
"We're proud of you

53:19.479 --> 53:23.270
"but the days of child's play are over.

53:26.478 --> 53:28.769
"You're not a little girl anymore.

53:29.269 --> 53:31.435
"We have no choice now.

53:32.476 --> 53:33.684
"Marguerite

53:34.225 --> 53:36.266
"I've made a grave decision.

53:37.224 --> 53:38.342
"From now on

53:38.432 --> 53:41.265
<i>You'll never see your family.</i>

53:43.223 --> 53:45.924
<i>You'll miss us, and we you,</i>

53:46.014 --> 53:48.097
<i>but you belong to another man</i>

53:49.138 --> 53:50.763
<i>whom you must honor.</i>

53:51.096 --> 53:54.297
<i>I ask that you devote yourself to him</i>

53:54.387 --> 53:56.838
<i>and to the children you give him.</i>

53:56.928 --> 54:00.296
<i>They'll bring you joy,
as you brought to us</i>

54:00.386 --> 54:02.302
<i>your mother and me.</i>

54:03.427 --> 54:05.427
<i>Tend to your sorrow thus.</i>

54:43.135 --> 54:44.551
Take me away.

55:27.717 --> 55:28.800
Speak to her.

55:31.133 --> 55:32.966
No luck tonight.

55:36.632 --> 55:37.965
Too much has happened.

55:39.090 --> 55:41.298
The situation is ridiculous.

55:45.214 --> 55:46.547
I have an idea.

55:48.963 --> 55:50.838
I'll go away for a few days.

55:51.588 --> 55:53.504
I'll leave you two alone.

55:54.795 --> 55:56.628
Maybe it will relax her.

55:59.753 --> 56:01.544
It will relax you too.

56:06.002 --> 56:07.377
Ace of hearts.

56:12.460 --> 56:13.876
It's a sign.

56:17.542 --> 56:20.125
- I'm here for the chimney.
- Come in.

56:22.125 --> 56:23.951
You usually come in May.

56:24.041 --> 56:25.916
This time, it's today.

56:26.916 --> 56:28.666
- Here it is.
- Very well.

56:29.582 --> 56:30.991
Rooms upstairs?

56:31.081 --> 56:33.157
With chimneys, I suppose?

56:33.247 --> 56:34.455
Lots of work.

56:47.705 --> 56:49.046
Miss Marguerite!

56:55.579 --> 56:56.995
Miss Marguerite!

56:57.078 --> 56:57.953
In here!

56:58.244 --> 57:00.119
Fear not!
Julien sent me.

57:02.119 --> 57:04.077
Here. For you.

57:05.785 --> 57:06.835
Good luck.

57:10.076 --> 57:12.242
<i>I'll free you at midnight.</i>

57:12.575 --> 57:14.158
<i>Get yourself ready.</i>

58:21.283 --> 58:22.116
Go on.

59:12.574 --> 59:14.199
Stay here on the lookout.

59:17.740 --> 59:19.573
Enough of your arrogance.

59:20.573 --> 59:22.281
You're no princess!

01:00:07.447 --> 01:00:09.322
Take some dresses!

01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:16.488
It's me.

01:00:16.738 --> 01:00:17.904
Julien!

01:00:30.154 --> 01:00:31.279
She's mine!

01:00:36.237 --> 01:00:37.313
Run!

01:00:37.403 --> 01:00:38.594
This way.

01:00:46.902 --> 01:00:48.102
Put this on.

01:00:59.027 --> 01:01:00.235
Hurry, go!

01:01:02.943 --> 01:01:04.109
Good luck.

01:04:28.234 --> 01:04:29.650
Do you regret it?

01:04:31.441 --> 01:04:32.816
Neither do I.

01:04:52.316 --> 01:04:56.024
I saw him, ma'am.
It was him in the bed.

01:05:21.857 --> 01:05:23.232
They are doomed.

01:06:12.482 --> 01:06:13.898
Wake up.

01:06:14.731 --> 01:06:16.022
Get up.

01:06:17.147 --> 01:06:18.272
Wake up.

01:06:44.897 --> 01:06:45.813
Come.

01:07:22.896 --> 01:07:24.779
He'll lead you to safety.

01:07:25.062 --> 01:07:26.478
We must go alone.

01:07:26.769 --> 01:07:28.102
I love you.

01:07:31.310 --> 01:07:32.560
My children

01:07:35.935 --> 01:07:37.393
Be careful.

01:07:57.851 --> 01:07:59.052
You're mad!

01:07:59.142 --> 01:08:01.343
I made the decision alone

01:08:01.433 --> 01:08:03.308
knowing you'd oppose it.

01:08:04.474 --> 01:08:07.508
Lefebvre will drop charges
if she goes back.

01:08:07.598 --> 01:08:11.132
His lawyer is coming now.
What do we do?

01:08:11.222 --> 01:08:12.513
We'll lie.

01:08:13.554 --> 01:08:15.755
We say we sent her away

01:08:15.845 --> 01:08:17.678
because he mistreated her.

01:08:18.594 --> 01:08:19.795
And Julien?

01:08:19.885 --> 01:08:21.343
No contact in months.

01:08:22.468 --> 01:08:24.009
Whereabouts unknown.

01:08:27.175 --> 01:08:28.591
It's beyond us now.

01:08:29.841 --> 01:08:33.959
Lefebvre, furious,
following his lawyer's advice,

01:08:34.049 --> 01:08:36.299
maintains his charges against them.

01:08:37.465 --> 01:08:40.666
He gathers testimonies,
goes to the chateau

01:08:40.756 --> 01:08:44.131
and presents his findings to the police.

01:08:44.546 --> 01:08:46.581
They're now wanted.

01:08:46.671 --> 01:08:49.754
A reward is promised
to anyone who helps.

01:08:50.879 --> 01:08:52.879
ON THE RUN

01:08:53.879 --> 01:08:56.545
<i>Marguerite and Julien are now fugitives.</i>

01:08:56.877 --> 01:08:58.794
Sought everywhere.

01:08:59.210 --> 01:09:01.460
Their only chance of escape

01:09:02.251 --> 01:09:04.709
is to make it to England by boat.

01:09:20.834 --> 01:09:22.618
If we got married,

01:09:22.707 --> 01:09:26.124
I would be your wife and your sister.

01:09:27.124 --> 01:09:28.332
And you'd be

01:09:30.747 --> 01:09:32.706
the father of my children,

01:09:33.913 --> 01:09:35.413
but also their uncle.

01:09:37.205 --> 01:09:38.830
And you, their aunt.

01:09:41.871 --> 01:09:43.953
Brothers, sisters and first cousins.

01:09:45.912 --> 01:09:47.453
But we're not married.

01:09:53.868 --> 01:09:55.160
What are we?

01:09:59.618 --> 01:10:01.784
Something that doesn't exist.

01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:03.991
So all's well.

01:10:06.532 --> 01:10:09.115
We risk nothing if we don't exist.

01:10:13.531 --> 01:10:15.072
What are you thinking?

01:10:15.988 --> 01:10:17.363
About Mother.

01:10:18.321 --> 01:10:19.446
And Father.

01:10:20.321 --> 01:10:21.654
And the chateau.

01:10:25.695 --> 01:10:28.729
<i>In England, we'll change our names.</i>

01:10:28.819 --> 01:10:30.694
<i>We'll start from scratch.</i>

01:10:31.444 --> 01:10:34.728
<i>Unknown to all.
Like everyone else.</i>

01:10:34.818 --> 01:10:36.352
<i>We'll never be free.</i>

01:10:36.442 --> 01:10:37.893
<i>Everything normal.</i>

01:10:37.983 --> 01:10:40.524
<i>- Even in England.
- Mother will visit.</i>

01:10:40.958 --> 01:10:42.076
<i>Everyone happy.</i>

01:10:42.166 --> 01:10:44.166
<i>Our love is a curse.</i>

01:13:14.207 --> 01:13:19.033
I'm sorry for having offended You,
all good, all kind

01:13:19.123 --> 01:13:21.116
and You don't like sin.

01:13:21.206 --> 01:13:24.865
Forgive me by the blood
of Jesus Christ, my Savior.

01:13:24.955 --> 01:13:27.746
Forgive me, God. Forgive us.

01:13:35.454 --> 01:13:36.870
We have to go.

01:14:12.745 --> 01:14:14.328
We have to leave.

01:14:16.494 --> 01:14:18.202
We must get to the sea.

01:15:42.910 --> 01:15:43.960
Come in.

01:15:47.743 --> 01:15:50.819
We found two people who look like them.

01:15:50.909 --> 01:15:51.818
Where?

01:15:51.908 --> 01:15:53.033
Barfleur.

01:15:53.408 --> 01:15:56.241
I'll alert the police myself.

01:16:01.907 --> 01:16:03.407
England.

01:16:08.907 --> 01:16:09.865
Water.

01:16:33.406 --> 01:16:34.822
You look decrepit.

01:16:35.113 --> 01:16:36.821
I think I'm pregnant.

01:17:25.237 --> 01:17:28.945
I found a way to England.
Tomorrow at dawn.

01:17:29.736 --> 01:17:31.569
We'll go out the back door.

01:17:39.819 --> 01:17:42.694
All right? Can you make the crossing?

01:17:44.235 --> 01:17:45.360
Yes.

01:18:23.235 --> 01:18:24.360
Tomorrow.

01:18:24.818 --> 01:18:26.234
We leave tomorrow.

01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:48.566
It's daybreak.

01:20:31.232 --> 01:20:32.940
The boat's this way.

01:20:40.773 --> 01:20:42.314
Something's wrong.

01:20:45.022 --> 01:20:49.022
We have to split up.
Go back to bed at the inn.

01:20:49.980 --> 01:20:51.771
I'll meet you after.

01:20:52.771 --> 01:20:54.146
Go back!

01:20:54.479 --> 01:20:55.395
Run!

01:20:56.770 --> 01:20:58.103
Go on!

01:22:35.436 --> 01:22:37.644
<i>They'd changed identities.</i>

01:22:38.894 --> 01:22:41.102
<i>Marguerite was dressed as man.</i>

01:22:42.435 --> 01:22:44.768
The Saint-LÃ´ police arrested them.

01:22:48.934 --> 01:22:50.302
<i>How are they?</i>

01:22:50.392 --> 01:22:52.058
<i>In good health.</i>

01:22:54.308 --> 01:22:56.099
They haven't said a word.

01:22:56.682 --> 01:22:59.557
Since the arrest, not a word.

01:23:01.098 --> 01:23:02.764
Can I see them?

01:23:04.639 --> 01:23:06.139
That's impossible.

01:23:07.014 --> 01:23:08.597
What can we do?

01:23:11.097 --> 01:23:12.180
Nothing.

01:23:40.763 --> 01:23:43.138
<i>I beg of you, Uncle. Help us.</i>

01:23:43.388 --> 01:23:45.631
We must save the children.

01:23:45.721 --> 01:23:47.721
It's gone too far now.

01:23:48.304 --> 01:23:50.429
Your children broke the law.

01:23:51.387 --> 01:23:53.470
They can't take that back.

01:23:53.845 --> 01:23:55.838
Your connections can help.

01:23:55.928 --> 01:23:57.678
Look at this situation.

01:23:58.053 --> 01:24:00.296
In 10, 100, 1000 years

01:24:00.386 --> 01:24:04.136
incest is, and will remain, a crime.

01:24:04.927 --> 01:24:06.920
Only God can save them.

01:24:07.010 --> 01:24:10.343
I'll try the impossible.
I'll go to the King!

01:24:14.301 --> 01:24:15.051
Jean!

01:24:17.092 --> 01:24:19.758
See Villeroy, Secretary of State.

01:24:24.341 --> 01:24:26.007
Tell him I sent you.

01:24:37.215 --> 01:24:41.215
Do you admit to the crime
Mr. Lefebvre accuses you of?

01:24:47.173 --> 01:24:49.506
Mr. Lefebvre is a liar.

01:24:51.714 --> 01:24:53.957
He mistreated my sister.

01:24:54.047 --> 01:24:56.255
So you won't admit to it?

01:24:59.088 --> 01:25:00.296
He won't confess.

01:25:03.254 --> 01:25:04.913
Submit them to Inquest.

01:25:05.003 --> 01:25:06.711
You mean torture.

01:25:07.211 --> 01:25:08.711
She couldn't bear it.

01:26:28.669 --> 01:26:30.044
It's a boy.

01:26:59.877 --> 01:27:01.293
I love you, Julien.

01:27:03.626 --> 01:27:06.827
Release my brother.
I'm the one to blame.

01:27:06.917 --> 01:27:08.201
Free him.

01:27:08.291 --> 01:27:10.034
My husband beat me.

01:27:10.124 --> 01:27:11.707
He wanted to kill me.

01:27:12.082 --> 01:27:13.623
He saw loose women.

01:27:15.206 --> 01:27:16.914
How long were you at home?

01:27:17.789 --> 01:27:18.955
A few days.

01:27:19.830 --> 01:27:21.730
Why did you leave Tourlaville?

01:27:21.788 --> 01:27:24.663
For fear
my husband would come for me.

01:27:24.996 --> 01:27:26.412
You left alone?

01:27:28.578 --> 01:27:29.578
Really?

01:27:34.161 --> 01:27:35.869
Mrs. Lefebvre,

01:27:36.244 --> 01:27:39.035
you haven't seen your husband
in 11 months.

01:27:39.451 --> 01:27:40.784
That's right.

01:27:41.284 --> 01:27:44.325
And you just gave birth to a son.

01:27:49.450 --> 01:27:53.616
Who is the father,
since it can't be your husband?

01:27:54.866 --> 01:27:56.116
I don't know.

01:27:57.699 --> 01:27:58.574
The cat.

01:28:08.282 --> 01:28:10.032
Monsieur de Villeroy!

01:28:20.990 --> 01:28:24.066
Monsieur de Ravalet from Tourlaville,

01:28:24.156 --> 01:28:26.406
here for an audience.

01:28:27.322 --> 01:28:28.447
Come closer.

01:28:38.072 --> 01:28:39.738
Stand, sir.

01:28:40.696 --> 01:28:43.029
Tell me what grieves you.

01:28:43.904 --> 01:28:46.154
I will remedy it if I can.

01:28:47.195 --> 01:28:51.229
Alas, sire,
my children will be executed

01:28:51.319 --> 01:28:54.110
unless you show them clemency.

01:28:55.318 --> 01:28:56.859
What is this about?

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:10.691
All of Europe says
the French Court is a whorehouse.

01:29:11.857 --> 01:29:15.857
I'm called a heretic,
with my mistresses and bastards.

01:29:16.982 --> 01:29:21.232
How can the Royal Body
suddenly condone incest?

01:29:27.732 --> 01:29:30.607
I cannot before God forgive this crime.

01:29:32.315 --> 01:29:33.773
It is too grave.

01:29:43.023 --> 01:29:44.564
Show in the defendants!

01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:04.855
Marguerite and Julien de Ravalet

01:30:06.230 --> 01:30:10.438
are condemned to die at the stake
for the following crimes:

01:30:10.896 --> 01:30:13.889
adultery, incest

01:30:13.979 --> 01:30:16.479
aiding and abetting treason.

01:30:17.729 --> 01:30:21.430
But given your class,
His Majesty our King

01:30:21.520 --> 01:30:23.679
in his extreme kindness

01:30:23.769 --> 01:30:26.769
has commuted your sentence to beheading.

01:30:29.102 --> 01:30:30.720
Only I should die!

01:30:30.810 --> 01:30:32.226
I'm the guilty one!

01:30:33.267 --> 01:30:36.517
My brother is innocent!
It's all my fault!

01:30:36.892 --> 01:30:38.676
Release my brother!

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:40.266
Please release him!

01:31:10.891 --> 01:31:13.016
- The condemned?
- Come.

01:32:18.016 --> 01:32:19.141
Always.

01:32:20.182 --> 01:32:21.307
Again.

01:32:23.432 --> 01:32:24.473
Always.

01:33:09.014 --> 01:33:10.472
She's dead.

01:34:36.597 --> 01:34:38.263
She named him Julien.

01:35:00.638 --> 01:35:01.721
Let's go.

01:35:53.887 --> 01:35:56.053
<i>We two - how long were we fool'd!?</i>

01:35:57.428 --> 01:35:59.171
<i>Now transmuted,</i>

01:35:59.261 --> 01:36:02.136
<i>we swiftly escape, as nature.</i>

01:36:03.927 --> 01:36:05.468
<i>We are Nature</i>

01:36:06.259 --> 01:36:09.884
<i>long have we been absent,
but now we return.</i>

01:36:12.342 --> 01:36:15.376
<i>We become plants, leaves, foliage</i>

01:36:15.466 --> 01:36:18.132
<i>roots, bark.</i>

01:36:18.757 --> 01:36:20.673
<i>We are bedded in the ground</i>

01:36:21.548 --> 01:36:22.948
<i>we are rocks.</i>

01:36:23.214 --> 01:36:24.623
<i>We are oaks.</i>

01:36:24.713 --> 01:36:27.046
<i>We grow side by side.</i>

01:36:28.262 --> 01:36:30.463
<i>Fish swimming in the sea together.</i>

01:36:30.553 --> 01:36:33.871
<i>We are what the locust blossoms are,
dropping scents</i>

01:36:33.961 --> 01:36:38.127
<i>Also the coarse smut of beasts,
vegetables, minerals.</i>

01:36:38.918 --> 01:36:40.918
<i>We are two resplendent suns</i>

01:36:41.584 --> 01:36:43.618
<i>in balance, orbic, stellar.</i>

01:36:43.708 --> 01:36:46.784
<i>We prowl fang'd and four-footed
in the woods</i>

01:36:46.874 --> 01:36:48.117
<i>we spring.</i>

01:36:48.207 --> 01:36:50.158
<i>We are seas mingling,</i>

01:36:50.248 --> 01:36:54.581
<i>cheerful waves rolling over each other,
interwetting each other.</i>

01:36:55.081 --> 01:36:57.990
<i>We are what the atmosphere is,
transparent</i>

01:36:58.080 --> 01:37:00.246
<i>Pervious, impervious.</i>

01:37:01.329 --> 01:37:04.245
<i>We are snow, rain, cold, darkness.</i>

01:37:05.161 --> 01:37:07.202
<i>We have circled and circled</i>

01:37:07.618 --> 01:37:10.993
<i>till we have arrived home again.
The only place we two have.</i>

01:37:12.326 --> 01:37:14.159
<i>We have voided all</i>

01:37:14.825 --> 01:37:16.366
<i>but freedom,</i>

01:37:17.116 --> 01:37:19.991
<i>and all but our joy.</i>

01:37:28.741 --> 01:37:34.734
Marguerite and Julien de Ravalet died
on December 2, 1603.

with the following epitaph:

01:37:40.823 --> 01:37:43.566
"Here lie the brother and sister.

01:37:43.656 --> 01:37:49.681
"You who pass by, ask not why they died.
Walk on and pray for their souls."
