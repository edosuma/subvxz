I'm calling

department at CapitaI One.

09:48.838 --> 09:51.798
We've detected
some unusual activity
on your credit card.

09:51.882 --> 09:54.426
Oh, man. Do you think
it was stolen?

09:54.510 --> 09:57.596
First, would you
mind verifying
your home address?

Wait a minute.
Yes, l am.

10:15.281 --> 10:17.073
I'm going to go ahead
and put a hold on your card.

10:17.158 --> 10:19.409
No. That. . . l. . .

10:20.036 --> 10:24.331
l think that we should
let the criminal use
the card a little longer.

10:24.624 --> 10:27.626
Very funny, sir.
We'll get a new card
out to you right away.

lf you want to supplement
your coverage,
we can do that.

10:38.429 --> 10:41.973
lf you want to replace
your current coverage,
all the better.

Hey, you seem
like a nice guy.

10:43.351 --> 10:44.559
Oh, he's not that nice.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.061
That's true.
Mmm-hmm.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.271
That's very true.
Okay, shut up.

10:48.356 --> 10:50.148

10:50.232 --> 10:53.318
Yeah, l'll have the linguini,
red sauce on the side.

10:53.402 --> 10:56.905
lf the sauce does
not come on the side,
l will send it back.

have the spaghetti

l send it back.

Jim's credit cards?

quick on my feet,

fast on the phone.

11:37.238 --> 11:39.114

Look closely, Michael.
l feel there's a plan
here for you.

12:07.685 --> 12:09.894

a plan for you.

12:10.479 --> 12:11.771
How about you?

12:11.856 --> 12:14.858

telling me how much

it needed oil,
but l wouldn't
give it any oil.

18:47.626 --> 18:51.295
Oh! Great, Michael.
I'm just finishing up
your paperwork right now.

18:51.380 --> 18:53.965
Oh, really? ls that
supposed to scare me?

18:54.550 --> 18:55.800
I thought
you'd be pleased.

18:55.884 --> 18:58.010
Well, you thought wrong.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.429
Because l am not pleased.
l'm actually kind of p.o.'d.

19:00.556 --> 19:02.306
Why?
l think you know
exactly why.

19:02.391 --> 19:06.477
Because you were
trying to scare me
into buying insurance.

19:06.562 --> 19:08.271
I don't get it.
How was I scaring you?

19:08.355 --> 19:10.523
l think you knew exactly
what you were doing,

19:10.607 --> 19:13.442
and frankly,
l think you were being
a total and utter jerk.

19:13.527 --> 19:14.527
Ooh, okay.

19:14.611 --> 19:16.028
You suck.
DWlGHT: Okay. That's. . .

19:16.113 --> 19:17.864
And l'm not going to buy
your stupid insurance.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.657
That's good, let's
wrap it up. Okay.
How about that?

19:19.741 --> 19:21.868
The only person
that actually needs
insurance is you,

19:21.952 --> 19:23.953
if you show your
face around here
again. Got it?

19:24.037 --> 19:26.622
Look, Michael,
when we aII
calm down here,

19:26.707 --> 19:28.291
maybe at some point
in the future,

19:28.375 --> 19:30.501
you change your mind,
why don't you
give me a call?

19:30.586 --> 19:31.878
Doubt it.

19:34.756 --> 19:35.840
Oh, man.

19:35.924 --> 19:37.592
What a tool.

19:41.972 --> 19:42.972
What?

19:43.056 --> 19:44.182
Next time you look
in the mirror,

19:44.266 --> 19:48.686
you're going to be
looking at a guy who
stood down the Mafia.

19:49.438 --> 19:51.606
No. What do you mean?

19:51.690 --> 19:55.443
We just told you
he wasn't Mafia
so you wouldn't be scared.

19:56.612 --> 19:57.612
What?

19:57.696 --> 20:00.198
You successfully
backed down the mob.

20:00.282 --> 20:04.952
You made the Mafia
apologize to you.
You made the Mafia be polite.

20:05.537 --> 20:07.288
Oh, man.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.251
l should be mad
at you guys.

20:13.337 --> 20:14.879
But l'm not.

20:14.963 --> 20:17.548
So, l looked him
in the eye and l said,

20:17.633 --> 20:20.092
"Not today, Grotti.
Not today.

20:20.177 --> 20:24.263
"And not tomorrow,
and not the next day,
or the day after that.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.349
"And you can tell
all your friends that

20:26.433 --> 20:29.560
"if l see them,
then they are already dead."

20:29.645 --> 20:30.895
l said
something
like that.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.021
Very close.

20:32.105 --> 20:33.064
Just to be clear,
he backed down

20:33.148 --> 20:35.191
an insurance agent from
Mutual of Harrisburg.

20:35.275 --> 20:36.234
Erin?
ERlN: Yes?

20:36.318 --> 20:37.526
Coffee.
Okay.

20:37.611 --> 20:39.904
Not from the kitchen,
Stop & Shop.

20:39.988 --> 20:41.447
lf it's not Stop & Shop,
l send it back.

20:41.531 --> 20:42.531
Okay.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.617
Large.
lf it's a medium,
l send it back.

20:44.701 --> 20:46.911
lf it's an extra large,
l send it back.

20:46.995 --> 20:48.371
How do you
return coffee?

20:48.455 --> 20:49.497
Go.

20:51.250 --> 20:52.750
Any questions?

20:54.002 --> 20:55.086
(PHONE RlNGlNG)

20:55.170 --> 20:56.420
PAM: (ON PHONE)
Are you kidding me?

20:56.505 --> 20:58.631
Hi, Pam. ls Jim there?

20:58.715 --> 21:01.259

has been canceIed and
we have to deaI with that.

21:01.343 --> 21:04.387

handIe the fact that
you're calling us here.

21:04.471 --> 21:07.807
Okay, that sounds good.
l'll let you go.

21:07.891 --> 21:12.436
Just tell Jim

21:12.521 --> 21:16.816

my top priority.

21:16.900 --> 21:18.609

21:18.694 --> 21:19.944
(DlAL TONE SOUNDlNG)

21:22.030 --> 21:24.365
They have no idea
what happened.
