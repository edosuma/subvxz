00:19.000 --> 00:20.210
- I'll get it!

00:24.120 --> 00:25.059
Finally.

00:32.289 --> 00:33.079
Thank you.

00:43.210 --> 00:44.210
It's perfect.

00:50.920 --> 00:52.750
- How's it going out here?

00:52.750 --> 00:53.880
- Almost done.

00:53.880 --> 00:56.750
Just have to attach some
rings to Jupiter here,

00:56.750 --> 00:57.960
paint the red spots,

00:57.960 --> 01:01.039
do a little work on the
storms at the poles.

01:01.420 --> 01:02.210
Overkill?

01:02.210 --> 01:04.120
- Maybe just a smidge.

01:04.120 --> 01:07.920
- I just want to make sure
my diorama is accurate.

01:07.920 --> 01:11.879
You know, it's 25% of my
grade in AP Astronomy.

01:11.879 --> 01:13.329
- That's next year.

01:13.329 --> 01:14.829
- I know.

01:14.829 --> 01:17.710
But all this effort will pay
off when I impress everyone

01:17.710 --> 01:19.289
at the Semester at Sea program

01:19.289 --> 01:21.500
with my astronavigation skills.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.039
- Lookin' great sweetie.

01:25.039 --> 01:26.120
- Thanks Mom.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.750
I'm just finishing
up so I can go back

01:27.750 --> 01:29.210
to packing for my
semester at sea.

01:29.210 --> 01:31.750
You know, on the ship they
have four state-of-the-art

01:31.750 --> 01:34.539
research labs, open
24 hours a day,

01:34.539 --> 01:37.500
unlimited access to
supplies and equipment,

01:37.500 --> 01:41.500
an SBE45 thermosalinograph,

01:41.500 --> 01:43.829
and in-vivo chlorophyll
fluorometer.

01:45.170 --> 01:46.920
- So I've mentioned that before?

01:48.250 --> 01:50.710
In 72 hours, while you guys

01:50.710 --> 01:52.879
are on your annual
medical mission,

01:52.879 --> 01:55.250
I'm going to be on one
of the most advanced

01:55.250 --> 01:57.000
research vessels in existence,

01:57.000 --> 02:00.120
studying fluid dynamics,
and ocean waves.

02:00.120 --> 02:01.250
- Every girls' dream.

02:02.290 --> 02:03.750
- Okay, I'd better go pack.

02:05.040 --> 02:06.500
- Our own little Madame Curie.

02:07.709 --> 02:09.330
- Hopefully with
a happier ending.

02:12.960 --> 02:15.669
- Okay, so you get to
Sydney at 10:00 a.m.

02:15.669 --> 02:18.079
and we get to New Delhi at 6:30,

02:18.079 --> 02:21.960
but there's a four and a
half hour time difference so.

02:21.960 --> 02:25.170
- So I'll be totally
fine and I'll call you

02:25.170 --> 02:27.289
as soon as I land.

02:27.289 --> 02:28.289
Don't worry, Mom.

02:30.120 --> 02:32.289
- Oh, I'm gonna
miss you so much.

02:32.289 --> 02:33.579
- It's only a few months.

02:33.579 --> 02:35.039
It'll go by really fast.

02:40.210 --> 02:44.039
- Now, If a giant squid
attaches itself to the boat,

02:44.039 --> 02:46.789
scream and run for
the life rafts.

02:46.789 --> 02:48.289
- Thanks, Doctor Bailey.

02:48.289 --> 02:50.960
I live for these little
lifesaving nuggets of wisdom.

02:50.960 --> 02:53.620
- I love ya, Kitten Britches.

02:53.620 --> 02:55.750
- Flight
1823 to New Delhi,

02:55.750 --> 02:58.960
now boarding,
International Gate I-50.

03:00.330 --> 03:01.500
- Gotta go, Babe.

03:01.500 --> 03:03.960
Remember, have fun.

03:05.039 --> 03:06.210
- You're sure you're okay?

03:06.210 --> 03:08.289
- Me? I'm better than okay.

03:11.789 --> 03:14.250
Doin' okay!

03:14.250 --> 03:15.169
Doin' okay.

03:16.379 --> 03:17.170
- You all right?

03:17.170 --> 03:18.210
- I'm sorry.

03:54.460 --> 03:56.670
Are you doing the
semester at sea?

03:56.670 --> 03:57.829
I'm Cory.

03:57.829 --> 03:59.670
Have they said anything
about the thermosalinograph

03:59.670 --> 04:00.460
or the fluorometers?

04:00.460 --> 04:02.289
Is there like a sign up sheet?

04:02.289 --> 04:05.000
I want to make sure I
get plenty of lab time.

04:06.210 --> 04:08.000
I have this hypothesis
about the effects

04:08.000 --> 04:11.669
of decreasing salinity on
wave peaks and biodiversity.

04:11.669 --> 04:12.710
I know what you're thinking,

04:12.710 --> 04:15.120
and admittedly,
it's pretty radical,

04:15.120 --> 04:17.250
but there is some
anecdotal evidence from,

04:18.790 --> 04:23.540
from some research vessels in
the Arctic Circle, wait up!

04:29.750 --> 04:30.750
Thank you.

04:39.670 --> 04:41.540
Did you see a girl
about yay high,

04:41.540 --> 04:44.459
glasses, ponytail,
cute, but sort of nerdy?

04:44.459 --> 04:45.709
- You mean besides yourself?

04:51.670 --> 04:53.670
- I wonder where she is?

05:00.540 --> 05:03.170
I guess she'll have
to catch the next one.

- Chlorophyll fluorometer.

05:44.670 --> 05:46.040
- Hey, we're here.

05:47.670 --> 05:48.620
- Thank you.

05:48.620 --> 05:50.829
I wouldn't want
to miss the boat.

05:50.829 --> 05:53.790
- Yeah, so we'll see
you on the pitch?

05:56.170 --> 05:56.959
Boat?

05:58.170 --> 05:58.959
- Pitch?

06:02.670 --> 06:03.670
What was that?

06:11.620 --> 06:12.709
Where's the ship?

06:14.040 --> 06:15.620
- What ship?

06:15.620 --> 06:16.620
- What ship?

06:16.620 --> 06:18.040
The ship.

06:18.040 --> 06:19.170
Where's the dock?

06:19.170 --> 06:20.620
- Same place it's
always been, I hope,

06:20.620 --> 06:22.000
about 60 kilometers south.

06:23.959 --> 06:24.920
- No, no, no no no no.

06:25.750 --> 06:26.959
- Are you okay?

06:26.959 --> 06:28.500
- I'm supposed to be
at the Harold Academy.

06:28.500 --> 06:29.290
- You're in the right place.

06:29.290 --> 06:31.420
- Semester at sea?

06:31.420 --> 06:34.420
- Oh, you're not
in the right place.

06:34.420 --> 06:36.420
This is the Soccer Academy.

06:36.420 --> 06:38.750
See, there's the Soccer
Academy and Harold Arts Academy

06:38.750 --> 06:40.879
and Harold Humanities Academy,

06:40.879 --> 06:42.500
and the Semester at Sea Program.

06:42.500 --> 06:43.290
- What? No!

06:45.209 --> 06:48.750
Okay, okay, calm down.

06:48.750 --> 06:49.540
- I'll try.

06:50.750 --> 06:53.290
- If the ship is
60 kilometers away,

06:53.290 --> 06:55.540
then I can catch a ride
at an average speed

06:55.540 --> 06:57.500
of 100 kilometers per hour,

06:57.500 --> 06:59.079
I can make it to the ship by--

07:03.750 --> 07:04.829
It left two hours ago.

07:09.670 --> 07:12.250
I'm supposed to be
with the dolphins.

07:12.250 --> 07:14.209
- The boys' practice
team is called the Orcas.

07:14.209 --> 07:15.540
Does that help?

07:16.620 --> 07:19.379
- I see, I see.

07:19.379 --> 07:21.209
The Semester at Sea?

07:21.209 --> 07:22.620
I see.

07:22.620 --> 07:25.329
Oh, I see.

07:25.329 --> 07:26.829
Okay, all right, thank you.

07:26.829 --> 07:27.620
See ya.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.420
- What did they say?

07:30.420 --> 07:31.420
- Look it's not great.

07:31.420 --> 07:32.879
The ship for the Semester at Sea

07:32.879 --> 07:35.000
has already departed the dock.

07:35.000 --> 07:36.709
- But they can
turn around, right?

07:36.709 --> 07:40.750
I mean, it's a ship, it
can float this direction.

07:40.750 --> 07:41.920
- Wouldn't that be a treat,

07:41.920 --> 07:44.379
but the research
schedule wouldn't allow

07:44.379 --> 07:45.959
for any delays, I'm afraid.

07:47.420 --> 07:48.790
- Then I'll go to them.

07:48.790 --> 07:50.670
I could get a speedboat, or--

07:50.670 --> 07:53.670
- Well they're just a little
bit too far out already,

07:53.670 --> 07:56.290
but are you ready
for the great news?

07:57.459 --> 07:59.750
- The school owns a blimp
with rappelling ropes?

07:59.750 --> 08:01.920
- Okay, you're gonna
need to let that go.

08:01.920 --> 08:03.790
But, because the Semester at Sea

08:03.790 --> 08:06.920
is one of our Harold
Academy sister programs,

08:06.920 --> 08:09.329
we can transfer your
registration and tuition

08:09.329 --> 08:11.750
here to the Soccer Academy.

08:12.670 --> 08:14.790
- No, please there
has to be a way.

08:14.790 --> 08:17.250
- Cory, we spoke
to your parents.

08:17.250 --> 08:18.620
They're on another continent,

08:18.620 --> 08:20.790
your ship's in the open ocean

08:20.790 --> 08:22.120
and your options are limited.

08:22.120 --> 08:24.790
So, let's just try and
make the best of it, okay?

08:26.420 --> 08:28.620
- But I don't play soccer.

08:28.620 --> 08:30.620
- Correction, you
didn't play soccer.

08:30.620 --> 08:34.500
Now, here is your schedule,

08:34.500 --> 08:37.620
your campus map,

08:37.620 --> 08:42.289
and your dorm assignment,
and everything else there,

08:42.289 --> 08:44.000
and you can check
in straight away.

08:45.669 --> 08:48.210
That's the spirit, now
tryouts are tomorrow.

08:48.210 --> 08:50.789
Remember, the first
rule of soccer is--

08:50.789 --> 08:53.000
- You can't touch the
ball with your hands?

08:53.000 --> 08:54.580
- Well that's not
what I was gonna say,

08:54.580 --> 08:56.919
but all right yeah,
let's go with that.

08:56.919 --> 08:58.539
Okay, I'll see you on the field.

09:01.710 --> 09:04.789
I am so inspirational.

09:04.789 --> 09:07.250
- So who was that girl you
were talking to earlier?

09:07.250 --> 09:08.669
- I don't know.

09:08.669 --> 09:10.169
I guess she's supposed to
be doing Semester at Sea,

09:10.169 --> 09:12.460
but missed her boat and
ended up here instead.

09:12.460 --> 09:14.919
- Now's not the time to
start getting distracted.

09:14.919 --> 09:15.710
- Good point.

09:16.919 --> 09:18.960
- The scout's gonna be
looking at us this year.

09:18.960 --> 09:20.620
- They're gonna be
looking at everyone Lewis,

09:20.620 --> 09:22.580
that's what scouts
do, they scout.

09:22.580 --> 09:23.620
- I'm just saying,

09:23.620 --> 09:25.750
we have a big
opportunity this year.

09:25.750 --> 09:28.419
Professional club scouts,
the national leagues,

09:28.419 --> 09:30.669
this is our shot to show
them what we can do.

09:30.669 --> 09:32.039
Just stay focused.

09:32.039 --> 09:33.879
The world is your oyster.

09:33.879 --> 09:35.879
- I'm allergic to shellfish, so?

09:36.960 --> 09:40.460
- The world is your burrito.

09:42.330 --> 09:43.500
- Come on, let's
take some shots.

09:43.500 --> 09:45.379
- On the net and in life, right?

09:46.669 --> 09:47.460
Right?

09:54.710 --> 09:56.620
- So this isn't ideal,

09:56.620 --> 09:59.039
but would Jane Goodall
let this stop her?

09:59.830 --> 10:00.620
She would not.

10:04.620 --> 10:09.750
A little peace, a little quiet,
and a good night's sleep,

10:09.750 --> 10:11.620
and I'll be ready
to take on tomorrow.

10:12.669 --> 10:13.669
- They did not.

10:14.879 --> 10:16.120
- They definitely did.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.789
- Wait, who told
you they broke up?

10:23.039 --> 10:25.039
- I'm so sorry, are you okay?

10:25.039 --> 10:28.789
- It's not your fault, it's
just the day I'm having.

10:28.789 --> 10:30.669
- So, you're moving in?

10:30.669 --> 10:32.789
- They said our fourth
roommate was dropping out.

10:32.789 --> 10:33.620
This is awesome.

10:34.710 --> 10:36.620
- Yeah, awesome.

10:36.620 --> 10:39.620
- That's Charlotte, the world's
most organized 16 year old,

10:39.620 --> 10:42.210
and Adelle, fashionista
extraordinaire.

10:43.620 --> 10:44.960
And I am, Janessa.

10:46.879 --> 10:48.289
- Janessa loves to dance,

10:48.289 --> 10:50.120
no matter how
awkward the occasion.

10:50.120 --> 10:52.379
- Nice to meet
you all, I'm Cory.

10:52.379 --> 10:53.500
- Are you American?

10:53.500 --> 10:55.419
- Yeah, I'm from Los Angeles.

10:55.419 --> 10:56.620
- Do you know Ryan Gosling?

10:56.620 --> 10:57.419
- No.

10:57.419 --> 10:58.210
- What about Jennifer Lawrence?

10:58.210 --> 10:59.710
My girl, J-Law.

10:59.710 --> 11:01.580
- Settle down J-dawg.

11:01.580 --> 11:03.620
All right Cory, let's
get you settled.

11:03.620 --> 11:06.169
- So, are we all in this room?

11:06.169 --> 11:07.330
- Isn't it great?

11:07.330 --> 11:09.080
- Yeah, and lucky for you,

11:09.080 --> 11:12.000
you ended up in the best room
at Harold Soccer Academy.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.460
Charlotte can get you unpacked.

11:13.460 --> 11:15.169
- Oh, I can do that.

11:15.169 --> 11:18.120
- Charlotte lives for the
chance to organize anything,

11:18.120 --> 11:19.750
even if it's just a wardrobe.

11:19.750 --> 11:23.210
- Plus, it'll protect you
from Janessa's lucky socks,

11:23.210 --> 11:24.669
lurking in the wardrobe.

11:24.669 --> 11:26.669
- At this point, those things
could play soccer without you.

11:26.669 --> 11:29.669
- But you're not supposed
to wash lucky socks,

11:29.669 --> 11:32.919
that's the whole point
of lucky socks, dude.

11:32.919 --> 11:35.750
- Okay, let's do this.

11:35.750 --> 11:38.080
- Adelle, you can help her
figure out a first day outfit.

11:38.080 --> 11:39.250
- Really, I can--

11:39.250 --> 11:42.080
- Looks a little
on the wintry side.

11:42.080 --> 11:44.830
- I'm supposed to be in
the middle of the ocean.

11:44.830 --> 11:48.379
- That's deep, how do
you feel about sleeves?

11:48.379 --> 11:50.039
- Now that's all sorted.

11:50.039 --> 11:51.750
Anything else?

11:51.750 --> 11:53.169
- Just one thing,

11:54.710 --> 11:56.750
I've never played
soccer in my life.

11:58.830 --> 11:59.620
- Oh.

12:01.289 --> 12:03.750
- You mean, you've never
really played before?

12:03.750 --> 12:06.580
- Really, not ever.

12:06.580 --> 12:09.710
But I did spend some time
on Wikipedia last night.

12:09.710 --> 12:12.330
So there's two teams
of eleven players.

12:12.330 --> 12:16.250
- Seven, we play sides of seven
for camp, squads of eight.

12:16.250 --> 12:17.750
- And graded
according to ability.

12:17.750 --> 12:18.960
- And potential.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.250
I've been working my
potential all summer.

12:21.250 --> 12:23.460
- Here we are, locker number 83.

12:23.460 --> 12:24.879
- Yeah, that
looks about right.

12:24.879 --> 12:26.120
- My locker's right
next to yours,

12:26.120 --> 12:27.460
so I can help out
if you have any

12:27.460 --> 12:28.919
trouble finding your classes.

12:28.919 --> 12:30.750
- Yep, that looks like you.

12:34.250 --> 12:37.830
- Impressive, senior
advanced chemistry?

12:37.830 --> 12:39.379
You're smart.

12:39.379 --> 12:40.879
I couldn't do that.

12:40.879 --> 12:42.830
- Professor Oster is one of
the toughest teachers here.

12:42.830 --> 12:43.960
- I know!

12:43.960 --> 12:45.960
I was so excited
to hear that we get

12:45.960 --> 12:48.500
to take classes along
with our soccer.

12:48.500 --> 12:50.830
At least that's one
thing I look forward to.

12:50.830 --> 12:53.710
- Oh yeah, that's right up
there with visiting the dentist

12:53.710 --> 12:55.710
and mystery meat day
in the cafeteria,

12:55.710 --> 12:57.669
which reminder, is today.

12:57.669 --> 12:59.080
- Oh, come on.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.379
What's more exciting than
lunch meat with a secret?

13:01.379 --> 13:03.460
America, you're still here!

13:03.460 --> 13:05.289
- You guys know each other?

13:05.289 --> 13:06.580
- Yeah, we go way back.

13:06.580 --> 13:08.789
Remember that time you
fell asleep on the bus?

13:08.789 --> 13:09.789
Classic you.

13:09.789 --> 13:11.500
- He was there
yesterday to witness

13:11.500 --> 13:13.539
the greatest humiliation and

13:13.539 --> 13:15.539
saddest moment of my young life.

13:15.539 --> 13:16.580
- So this is Sea Girl?

13:17.919 --> 13:18.710
- Cory.

13:19.750 --> 13:22.039
Wait, are people
calling me Sea Girl?

13:22.039 --> 13:23.539
- No, no way.

13:23.539 --> 13:25.710
I just mentioned
you to Lewis is all.

13:26.789 --> 13:27.580
Oh, right.

13:27.580 --> 13:29.120
This is Lewis, and I'm Oliver.

13:31.710 --> 13:33.669
- Uh oh, incoming.

13:33.669 --> 13:34.620
- What are you doing?

13:34.620 --> 13:35.879
We're supposed to be warming up.

13:35.879 --> 13:37.039
Gotta work hard
if you don't want

13:37.039 --> 13:38.750
to end up on a
loser practice team.

13:40.919 --> 13:42.830
Why are you talking to Sea Girl?

13:42.830 --> 13:45.210
- Okay, this has been great.

13:45.210 --> 13:46.210
I'll see you around?

13:47.169 --> 13:47.960
- I'll be here.

13:50.710 --> 13:53.669
Who, what, and why was that?

13:53.669 --> 13:57.080
- That was the unnatural
phenomenon known as "Edie."

13:57.080 --> 13:58.580
- And we do mean phenomenon.

13:58.580 --> 14:00.500
- She learned to dribble
the day she learned to walk.

14:00.500 --> 14:02.120
- I hear Pele is her uncle.

14:02.120 --> 14:03.460
- And Ronaldo is
her other uncle.

14:03.460 --> 14:05.830
- And I hear you all
talking a bunch of nonsense.

14:05.830 --> 14:07.789
She's not that good.

14:07.789 --> 14:09.539
Come on, I'll walk
you to chemistry.

14:09.539 --> 14:12.620
So, what's up with
you and Oliver?

14:12.620 --> 14:14.330
- What do you mean?

14:14.330 --> 14:18.210
- I mean, speaking of
Advanced Chemistry.

14:19.250 --> 14:21.750
- What? Oh stop.

14:21.750 --> 14:24.419
- He's one of the best
players in the school.

14:24.419 --> 14:26.379
Everyone thinks he
and Edie are dating,

14:26.379 --> 14:28.580
but they've just been
friends since they were kids.

14:28.580 --> 14:29.669
- I'm not listening.

14:29.669 --> 14:30.460
- Oh yeah sure.

14:31.460 --> 14:33.879
But if you were, you'd
hear me saying that

14:33.879 --> 14:35.830
he's the cute Australian
soccer player,

14:35.830 --> 14:38.830
and you're the school's
mysterious new American.

14:38.830 --> 14:39.620
- I'm Sea Girl.

14:40.620 --> 14:42.620
- So, you just need
some rebranding.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.039
- See, if you get
here early enough,

14:56.039 --> 14:58.830
you get the whole
field to yourself.

14:58.830 --> 15:01.669
- So Edie, what have you
been up to since last summer?

15:01.669 --> 15:03.419
- School, my parents
were on location

15:03.419 --> 15:04.830
in New Zealand for
most of the year.

15:04.830 --> 15:07.039
- Must be great to have
such fantastic parents.

15:07.039 --> 15:08.169
How about you, Oliver?

15:09.080 --> 15:09.919
- Well.
- What?

15:11.039 --> 15:12.210
- My dad lost his job.

15:13.039 --> 15:14.710
It's been kind of tough.

15:14.710 --> 15:15.919
- That's awful, mate.

15:15.919 --> 15:18.419
- Yeah, I had to get
a job to pay for camp.

15:18.419 --> 15:19.830
It's my last chance to play.

15:19.830 --> 15:21.289
- What?

15:21.289 --> 15:22.830
- Well, I'm gonna have to
be working when I get back.

15:22.830 --> 15:23.620
I'm not gonna have time.

15:23.620 --> 15:24.620
- What are you talking about?

15:24.620 --> 15:25.710
You're one of the best players

15:25.710 --> 15:27.789
at the best soccer
camp in Australia.

15:27.789 --> 15:29.039
- So?

15:29.039 --> 15:30.460
- So, there are going to
be scouts watching you.

15:30.460 --> 15:31.620
If you really focus,

15:31.620 --> 15:33.169
you could get picked
up by a pro league.

15:33.169 --> 15:34.539
- We can help you?

15:34.539 --> 15:35.539
- You think so?

15:35.539 --> 15:38.330
- Like I said mate,
this is your year.

15:38.330 --> 15:40.080
The world is your burrito.

15:40.919 --> 15:42.580
- Oyster.

15:42.580 --> 15:44.120
- He's allergic
to shellfish, so.

15:45.580 --> 15:46.789
- Guys are you look at Leah?

15:46.789 --> 15:48.120
- Yes.

15:48.120 --> 15:49.830
I'm pretty sure she went
for the E Team last year.

15:54.210 --> 15:56.419
- Do you reckon we'll be getting
into the E Team this year?

15:58.710 --> 15:59.879
- I really wanted to.

16:01.710 --> 16:02.830
- No glasses!

16:02.830 --> 16:04.460
- I really only need
them for reading.

16:04.460 --> 16:05.669
- Well, you look great.

16:05.669 --> 16:06.710
- You made it.

16:06.710 --> 16:07.750
- Are you ready for tryouts?

16:07.750 --> 16:09.500
- Was Thomson's plum
pudding model of

16:09.500 --> 16:11.169
atomic architecture correct?

16:13.250 --> 16:14.710
No.

16:14.710 --> 16:17.669
- You really don't play
sports at all, do you?

16:17.669 --> 16:20.080
- Nope, it's always
been me and my books.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.710
If it were up to me,
it would stay that way.

16:22.710 --> 16:24.419
- Okay, stop.

16:24.419 --> 16:27.120
Look, if you'd read the
gigantic sign on your bus,

16:27.120 --> 16:30.330
you'd be swimming with
the humpbacks right now.

16:30.330 --> 16:31.669
- Common misconception,

16:31.669 --> 16:33.669
humpbacks migrate south.

16:33.669 --> 16:34.830
- Okay snooze.

16:34.830 --> 16:38.080
The point is, you're not
swimming with the whales.

16:38.080 --> 16:40.750
You're here, with the
coolest roommates on Earth.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.379
Why don't you make
the most of it?

16:42.379 --> 16:44.710
Break out of your shell,
and try something different.

16:44.710 --> 16:46.620
Come on, loosen up a little.

16:46.620 --> 16:49.789
- Well, cardiovascular
activity has been linked

16:49.789 --> 16:52.669
to the generation of new
neurons in the brain.

16:52.669 --> 16:53.669
- That's the spirit!

16:55.080 --> 16:56.750
I think.

17:07.539 --> 17:10.210
- You've gotta follow through.

18:35.250 --> 18:37.210
- That was a nice
warmup to the season.

18:38.329 --> 18:39.539
- That was warmup?

18:39.539 --> 18:42.380
- The first day's
always hardest, it

18:42.380 --> 18:44.579
- I hurt in muscles I
didn't even know I had.

18:47.710 --> 18:50.170
- Come on, we'll just
get you back to the room.

18:52.750 --> 18:54.539
- Hey, they're
posting the teams!

18:58.579 --> 19:00.670
- Yes, E Team for life!

19:00.670 --> 19:03.500
You've improved a lot
since last year, Janessa.

19:03.500 --> 19:05.079
Too bad it wasn't enough.

19:09.119 --> 19:13.829
- Well, the good news is that
we are all on the same team.

19:13.829 --> 19:14.920
Hashtag WOTB!

19:16.329 --> 19:19.670
- Okay, but what's WOTB?

19:19.670 --> 19:21.119
- Worst of the best.

19:21.119 --> 19:24.039
We only made the
practice team, again.

19:24.039 --> 19:26.539
- I thought you guys looked
great out there today.

19:26.539 --> 19:29.619
- Yeah, and that's why
we're the worst of the best.

19:29.619 --> 19:31.960
- It's an elite soccer camp
but somebody's got to be

19:31.960 --> 19:33.250
at the bottom of the list.

19:33.250 --> 19:36.750
- And at good old Harold
Academy, that's us.

19:36.750 --> 19:37.710
- Not for long.

19:38.579 --> 19:39.920
- What do you mean?

19:39.920 --> 19:41.579
- Didn't you guys hear?

19:41.579 --> 19:43.789
They're talking about cutting
the practice team next year.

19:43.789 --> 19:44.880
- Wait, what?

19:44.880 --> 19:47.539
- So anyone who's on
the practice this year--

19:47.539 --> 19:49.579
- Probably won't even
get in next year.

19:50.710 --> 19:51.579
- Welcome to the team.

19:52.750 --> 19:55.420
- Wait, what, wait,
they put me on a team?

19:56.579 --> 19:58.789
- Well yeah, what did you
think was gonna happen?

19:58.789 --> 20:01.829
- They'd realize I'm
so bad at sports,

20:01.829 --> 20:04.539
they'd buy that blimp
with rappelling ropes?

20:04.539 --> 20:08.329
- Oh, Edie is captain
of the E team again.

20:08.329 --> 20:10.000
- And that's special
or something?

20:10.000 --> 20:11.579
- Well, E stands for excellence.

20:11.579 --> 20:13.579
- It's the top
team at the school.

20:13.579 --> 20:15.539
My dad was on the boys'
E Team when he came here.

20:15.539 --> 20:16.920
- And my brother was captain.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.329
- Are they all like Edie?

20:18.329 --> 20:21.380
- Nobody's as special
as queen Edie.

20:21.380 --> 20:23.329
- Edie's parents are
big TV stars over here.

20:23.329 --> 20:25.460
- She thinks she's so much
better than all of us,

20:25.460 --> 20:28.119
and that we should all
worship her or something.

20:28.119 --> 20:30.329
- Just steer clear of
her and you'll be fine.

20:39.789 --> 20:41.380
- Hi, Mom and Dad.

20:41.380 --> 20:43.710
I tried to call but I
couldn't get through.

20:43.710 --> 20:45.500
Guess you're deep in the jungle.

20:45.500 --> 20:47.500
Try not to get eaten
by a giant snake.

20:48.920 --> 20:51.539
So, have you had
a chance to figure

20:51.539 --> 20:52.920
out how to get me out of here?

20:53.789 --> 20:55.750
They put me on a team.

20:55.750 --> 20:58.170
Like a soccer team.

20:58.170 --> 20:59.619
To play soccer.

20:59.619 --> 21:00.789
Can you believe that?

21:02.329 --> 21:05.380
Anyways, please call
me soon with news.

21:06.210 --> 21:07.750
Please.

21:07.750 --> 21:11.000
Please, please, please!

21:11.000 --> 21:11.789
Love, Cory.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.500
- Sorry to interrupt,

21:36.500 --> 21:38.039
I just left my book
in here after class.

21:38.039 --> 21:39.039
- No worries.

21:39.039 --> 21:40.710
I'm just working
on a demonstration

21:40.710 --> 21:43.420
of atomic emission
and luminescence.

21:43.420 --> 21:45.500
It's for my science
presentation.

21:45.500 --> 21:47.420
- You're working
on that already?

21:47.420 --> 21:49.710
- Well, it's a big
part of the grade.

21:49.710 --> 21:51.619
I wanted to get a head start.

21:51.619 --> 21:52.710
- Is that a pickle?

21:52.710 --> 21:54.670
- That's a keen observation.

21:54.670 --> 21:56.960
See, by sending voltage
through a pickle,

21:56.960 --> 21:58.710
the electrons from sodium atoms

21:58.710 --> 22:00.829
present in the
pickle are excited

22:00.829 --> 22:03.579
to a higher energy
state and then relaxed,

22:03.579 --> 22:06.460
emitting their energy
as visible yellow light,

22:07.670 --> 22:09.789
which is interesting
to precisely

22:09.789 --> 22:12.210
no one in this room
besides myself.

22:12.210 --> 22:14.329
- Don't, I love pickles.

22:14.329 --> 22:16.789
- Oliver, what's
taking you so long?

22:16.789 --> 22:18.000
- Cory's just teaching me

22:18.000 --> 22:19.710
how to make a
glow-in-the-dark pickle.

22:19.710 --> 22:23.750
- Actually, I'm studying atomic
emission and luminescence.

22:23.750 --> 22:26.619
- Okay, well try not to nerd
so hard you hurt yourself.

22:26.619 --> 22:27.670
- Are you done?

22:31.789 --> 22:32.579
- Got it.

22:32.579 --> 22:34.000
- Then let's go.

22:35.579 --> 22:36.920
- Nice goggles.

22:43.710 --> 22:44.579
- What was that about?

22:44.579 --> 22:46.329
- I know, that new
girl is so weird.

22:46.329 --> 22:47.119
It's like--

22:47.119 --> 22:48.460
- Not her, you.

22:48.460 --> 22:50.710
You seem to have some
sort of thing against her.

22:50.710 --> 22:52.829
- I just don't buy
her act, that's all.

22:52.829 --> 22:54.039
- What act?

22:54.039 --> 22:55.579
- A random American
girl shows up

22:55.579 --> 22:57.460
at the best development
camp in Australia

22:57.460 --> 22:58.329
but can't even play.

22:58.329 --> 22:59.079
- It was a mistake.

22:59.079 --> 23:00.539
- That's another thing.

23:00.539 --> 23:03.789
She's a super nerd who can't
even read the sign on a bus.

23:03.789 --> 23:04.880
- Come on.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.750
- Oliver, you need
to stay focused

23:06.750 --> 23:08.670
on impressing the
scouts this year.

23:08.670 --> 23:10.789
You can't get distracted,
especially by her.

23:11.920 --> 23:13.710
What's so great about Sea Girl?

23:13.710 --> 23:15.119
- Well, free pickles.

23:17.579 --> 23:19.000
And they glow in the dark.

23:27.380 --> 23:28.920
- What are we
doing on the beach?

23:28.920 --> 23:29.829
- Beats me.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.789
- Maybe my boat is
coming back to get me!

23:34.420 --> 23:36.789
Or maybe not.

23:36.789 --> 23:38.539
So, can I ask a question?

23:38.539 --> 23:39.619
- Sure, shoot.

23:40.880 --> 23:44.670
- Why do our uniforms feel like
they're leftovers from 1995?

23:44.670 --> 23:48.289
- Because they're
leftovers from 1995.

23:48.289 --> 23:49.619
- The E Team gets all
the new equipment,

23:49.619 --> 23:53.750
so the practice team gets
stuck with the castoffs.

23:55.579 --> 23:57.000
- Good morning, practice team.

23:57.000 --> 24:00.710
I thought today we would run
some drills on the beach.

24:00.710 --> 24:01.710
- Excuse me, Coach.

24:01.710 --> 24:02.920
- Yeah.

24:02.920 --> 24:03.880
Doesn't the physics
of running and kicking

24:03.880 --> 24:05.119
in the sand just make
everything that much harder?

24:05.119 --> 24:07.170
- Yep, yeah the
physics does that.

24:07.170 --> 24:10.670
And if you can kick
a goal on the beach,

24:10.670 --> 24:12.380
then you can kick a
goal on the field,

24:12.380 --> 24:15.500
so let's line up and
count off into teams.

24:52.170 --> 24:54.420
- How about this?

24:56.710 --> 24:57.960
Do you like this?

24:57.960 --> 24:59.500
- Cory, Cory beach boogie.

25:00.210 --> 25:02.119
- Cory.

25:02.119 --> 25:04.579
- Seriously Cory.

25:04.579 --> 25:06.420
- Thermosalinograph!

25:07.250 --> 25:09.619
Oliver, hi!

25:10.750 --> 25:13.579
So how long have you
been standing there?

25:13.579 --> 25:14.420
Probably long enough.

25:14.420 --> 25:15.210
Well, we were just--

25:16.289 --> 25:19.250
- Just doing the Cory
Cory Beach Boogie?

25:19.250 --> 25:20.579
Yeah, that's my favorite.

25:21.420 --> 25:23.670
- So, what are you doing here?

25:23.670 --> 25:24.380
- Well actually we were
just gonna go for a swim.

25:24.380 --> 25:26.920
- We're going swimming.

25:26.920 --> 25:27.710
What's up?

25:28.960 --> 25:30.170
- Want to join us?

25:30.170 --> 25:31.619
- Actually I have a
chemistry presentation--

25:31.619 --> 25:34.000
- That she's already spent
four hours practicing for.

25:34.000 --> 25:35.920
We are in.

25:35.920 --> 25:37.710
- But I didn't bring
my bathing suit.

25:37.710 --> 25:38.500
- Come on!

25:40.710 --> 25:42.500
- I don't really like swimming.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.250
- But you're Sea Girl.

26:23.619 --> 26:24.789
- That's a bad idea.

26:26.829 --> 26:27.920
- Sounds like you had
a rough year, man.

26:27.920 --> 26:30.789
- Yeah, and the worst part is,

26:30.789 --> 26:32.539
I know things are
still hard at home,

26:32.539 --> 26:34.880
and I'm not there and I
can't do anything to help.

26:34.880 --> 26:35.750
- What do your parents say?

26:35.750 --> 26:37.210
- They say I shouldn't worry,

26:37.210 --> 26:38.920
I should focus on what I can
control, and play my best.

26:38.920 --> 26:41.619
That's what you can
do to help, man.

26:41.619 --> 26:43.420
Play your best here so
you can get picked up,

26:43.420 --> 26:44.539
become a huge soccer star,

26:44.539 --> 26:47.539
and buy me and your
parents mansions,

26:47.539 --> 26:50.250
next to yours in
like, Glamarama.

26:50.250 --> 26:53.710
Now all you need to do is
show 'em what you can do.

26:53.710 --> 26:55.460
- That's easier said than done.

26:55.460 --> 26:57.579
- You know, most
things are buddy.

26:58.380 --> 26:58.880
Most things are.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.750
Want to head back?

27:01.829 --> 27:03.579
- No, I think I'm just
gonna take a minute.

27:08.619 --> 27:09.420
- I'll be right back.

27:14.579 --> 27:16.539
- Hey, I just remembered.

27:16.539 --> 27:17.170
- Everything okay?

27:17.170 --> 27:18.670
- Are you kidding?

27:18.670 --> 27:22.380
At a beach bonfire, okay is
the bare minimum you can be.

27:22.380 --> 27:24.420
I just wanted to
get away for a bit,

27:24.420 --> 27:25.170
be alone with my thoughts.

27:25.170 --> 27:26.960
- Oh sorry, I'll leave.

27:26.960 --> 27:29.710
- No no no, stay.

27:29.710 --> 27:30.710
I'm all out of thoughts.

27:33.670 --> 27:34.619
Are you having fun?

27:35.619 --> 27:38.250
- For the first time
since I've been here,

27:38.250 --> 27:39.670
I think I might be.

27:39.670 --> 27:40.960
- Ah, that's not true, I saw
you with that glowing pickle.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.539
You guys were having a blast.

27:44.579 --> 27:47.329
- Well, it's true,
as a general rule,

27:47.329 --> 27:50.500
I do find science to be
easier company than people.

27:50.500 --> 27:51.829
- Oh sorry, I'll leave.

27:51.829 --> 27:55.460
- No stay, I'm all
out of science.

27:58.170 --> 28:01.579
- So, how's the soccer portion
of soccer camp treating you?

28:01.579 --> 28:03.170
- That's not quite so great.

28:03.170 --> 28:04.960
But I did make a pass today.

28:04.960 --> 28:07.579
- That's awesome.

28:07.579 --> 28:09.119
- Yeah, I'm thinking
national team by next month.

28:24.329 --> 28:25.119
- Get lost again, Sea Girl?

28:28.420 --> 28:30.579
- We were just
catching some air.

28:30.579 --> 28:31.710
- I've seen you
play goalie, Cory.

28:31.710 --> 28:34.539
You should focus on
catching the ball.

28:34.539 --> 28:36.250
- Okay, you need a marshmallow.

28:40.079 --> 28:41.170
- What's her problem?

28:42.079 --> 28:44.000
- That's the beauty of Edie.

28:44.000 --> 28:46.880
She doesn't have any problems.

28:46.880 --> 28:49.210
She's just that way.

28:51.289 --> 28:53.500
- All right, give it
all you got, let's go.

28:55.380 --> 28:56.210
Great work, beautiful.

28:56.210 --> 28:58.710
Crowd go wild.

28:58.710 --> 28:59.710
Janessa, well done.

28:59.710 --> 29:00.710
Charlotte, you're up.

29:00.710 --> 29:02.460
Come on, hustle,
let's move girls.

29:04.119 --> 29:07.119
Okay, let's go, kick
it like you mean it.

29:10.579 --> 29:12.039
Yes, almost great, you
gotta work some footwork.

29:12.039 --> 29:14.380
Okay, Cory.

29:17.420 --> 29:19.420
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

29:19.420 --> 29:20.079
Okay Cory, let's bring it home.

29:22.710 --> 29:23.710
Uh, yep.

29:23.710 --> 29:27.670
Just to the other home
with the goal in it.

29:27.670 --> 29:29.170
Now, that's time up.

29:29.170 --> 29:31.079
Okay girls, I will see you
back here tomorrow, thank you.

29:31.079 --> 29:34.000
- Tomorrow maybe,
but not next year.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.750
- Come on Charlotte,
let's not think like that.

29:35.750 --> 29:39.380
Let's just make the most
of the time we have here.

29:53.579 --> 29:55.579
- Can I please have my bag?

29:55.579 --> 29:57.210
- What bag?

29:57.210 --> 29:58.619
- Don't play cute.

29:58.619 --> 30:00.420
Give me my bag.

30:00.420 --> 30:02.670
- I seriously don't know
what you're talking about.

30:02.670 --> 30:05.460
- I don't have time for your
games right now, Edie, okay?

30:06.500 --> 30:07.960
- You know what, I
do feel something.

30:10.619 --> 30:11.710
Is this what you're looking for?

30:11.710 --> 30:13.539
Is this your bag?

30:17.250 --> 30:28.710
Oops.

30:28.710 --> 30:29.460
- Thanks.

30:44.710 --> 30:46.079
- Can you tell her?

30:46.079 --> 30:48.380
- I don't want to tell her.

30:48.380 --> 30:49.170
- You tell her.

30:49.170 --> 30:50.500
- I'm not gonna tell her.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.500
- If you guys keep looking
at each other like that,

30:52.500 --> 30:54.500
your eyes are gonna
bulge out of your heads.

30:55.670 --> 30:56.500
- Fine.

30:58.210 --> 31:00.210
Are you gonna tell
us what happened

31:00.210 --> 31:01.670
between you and Edie today?

31:03.710 --> 31:05.960
- Edie and I just had a
little misunderstanding

31:05.960 --> 31:08.619
regarding my gear bag.

31:08.619 --> 31:09.670
No biggie.

31:09.670 --> 31:11.539
- Edie might beg to differ.

31:11.539 --> 31:12.750
- You do realize
she's gonna make it

31:12.750 --> 31:14.579
her mission in life to
get you back, right?

31:14.579 --> 31:17.539
- I'm not afraid of Edie.

31:17.539 --> 31:18.789
- I'm not saying you
should be scared,

31:18.789 --> 31:21.420
just maybe don't travel
through the halls alone.

31:21.420 --> 31:23.329
- Or leave any of
your food unattended.

31:23.329 --> 31:24.579
- Or fall asleep for the
next couple of nights,

31:24.579 --> 31:26.039
or ever again.

31:28.579 --> 31:30.000
- Cory should switch
to a secret locker.

31:30.000 --> 31:34.170
- Come on guys, she's
a high school girl.

31:34.170 --> 31:35.420
What's she gonna do?

31:49.289 --> 31:51.210
- Are you sure this
is a good idea?

31:51.210 --> 31:53.000
I mean, if you need a snack, I
have some Twisties in my bag.

31:53.000 --> 31:53.829
- Can you please be quiet?

31:53.829 --> 31:54.619
- Good idea.

31:58.920 --> 31:59.960
- So much for covert.

32:04.250 --> 32:05.170
- What are we looking for?

32:11.829 --> 32:13.000
- This.

32:13.000 --> 32:13.829
- That's the craving
that you're willing

32:13.829 --> 32:15.829
to risk arrest
and expulsion for?

32:15.829 --> 32:17.079
A cucumber?

32:17.079 --> 32:19.579
- Come on, let's go.

32:19.579 --> 32:20.380
- Wait.

32:21.380 --> 32:22.000
- What are you going?

32:22.000 --> 32:22.829
- We can't just take it
without paying for it.

32:26.460 --> 32:28.500
They'll know what
it's for, right?

32:28.500 --> 32:29.289
Hey wait.

32:32.119 --> 32:33.500
- You've left your
Powerpoint at home?

32:33.500 --> 32:36.289
- Well, yeah.

32:37.000 --> 32:38.000
- Why don't you go say hi?

32:38.000 --> 32:40.579
- What?

32:40.579 --> 32:41.420
- If you want to be
part of the loser crew,

32:41.420 --> 32:43.000
don't let me get in the way.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.710
- We've got a couple of minutes

32:44.710 --> 32:46.079
before class starts, you sure?

32:47.000 --> 32:47.789
- Go.

32:52.289 --> 32:54.289
- Hey, so you ready
to show the world

32:54.289 --> 32:54.789
a fluorescent pickle?

32:55.920 --> 32:59.329
- It's actually a
phosphorescent pickle.

32:59.329 --> 33:00.670
See, with a fluorescent object,

33:00.670 --> 33:02.789
the light stops as soon as
the energy source stops.

33:02.789 --> 33:05.539
But with phosphorescence, the
release of light is delayed.

33:05.539 --> 33:09.039
So it's actually a different
process at a subatomic level.

33:09.039 --> 33:09.829
- Who knew there was so
much science involved

33:09.829 --> 33:12.329
in lighting a vegetable?

33:13.250 --> 33:14.500
- Okay, everyone
please, take your seats.

33:14.500 --> 33:17.829
I'm looking forward to
our first presentation.

33:17.829 --> 33:18.670
Cory, to the front.

33:21.789 --> 33:23.619
- My presentation today is about

33:23.619 --> 33:25.829
atomic emission
and luminescence.

33:25.829 --> 33:28.420
During the pickling process,

33:28.420 --> 33:30.289
a pickle absorbs electrolytes,

33:30.289 --> 33:31.500
primarily sodium chloride.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.670
So, due to the ionic
nature of the compound,

33:33.670 --> 33:35.920
sodium chloride will
luminesce when hit with an

33:35.920 --> 33:36.880
electrical current.

33:47.500 --> 33:48.000
I don't understand.

33:51.619 --> 33:53.710
- Miss Bailey, I
expect my students to

33:53.710 --> 33:58.250
take these presentations
seriously, and come prepared.

33:58.250 --> 34:00.579
This is very disappointing.

34:00.579 --> 34:01.380
- But I did.

34:01.380 --> 34:02.329
- Please, take your seat.

34:06.500 --> 34:09.079
- Looks like you've gotten
yourself into quite the pickle.

34:09.079 --> 34:10.960
- Now, last time we were looking

34:10.960 --> 34:13.750
at weak versus
strong electrolytes.

34:13.750 --> 34:17.619
Strong electolytes
ionize completely, 100%.

34:17.619 --> 34:20.539
While weak electrolytes
ionize only partially,

34:20.539 --> 34:23.710
usually in the
order of one to 10%.

34:23.710 --> 34:26.710
That is, the principal
species of solutions

34:26.710 --> 34:28.880
for strong
electrolytes are ions.

34:38.539 --> 34:41.960
Strong acids, strong
bases, and salts.

34:41.960 --> 34:43.619
- That was pretty
rough in there today.

34:43.619 --> 34:44.619
- What?

34:44.619 --> 34:46.539
- Cory's chemistry presentation.

34:46.539 --> 34:49.170
She seemed really embarrassed.

34:50.170 --> 34:52.329
- Hey, what are you
guys talking about?

34:52.329 --> 34:53.210
- Nothing.

34:53.210 --> 34:53.829
- Cory's science presentation.

34:53.829 --> 34:55.619
- I heard about that.

34:55.619 --> 34:57.250
Disaster, huh?

34:57.250 --> 34:58.000
- Maybe she should
have practiced more

34:58.000 --> 34:58.750
instead of hanging
out at the bonfire.

34:58.750 --> 35:00.210
- She did!

35:00.210 --> 35:01.579
Remember, we saw her in the
science lab that one day?

35:01.579 --> 35:02.920
I saw that pickle glow!

35:02.920 --> 35:03.710
- Can we talk about
something other

35:03.710 --> 35:05.500
than pickles for
like five minutes?

35:05.500 --> 35:06.579
- Sure, sure.

35:08.500 --> 35:09.920
- So what happened
with the pickles?

35:09.920 --> 35:11.920
- I don't know, the electrolytes
should have lit it up.

35:11.920 --> 35:13.500
Can a pickle get depickled?

35:14.579 --> 35:16.710
- What, you mean
like, like a cucumber?

35:17.880 --> 35:18.960
That's weird because--

35:18.960 --> 35:20.619
- It's impossible for a
pickle to get depickled.

35:20.619 --> 35:23.039
She must have just
done something wrong.

35:23.039 --> 35:25.119
- Huh.

35:25.119 --> 35:26.500
- Come on, let's
get to practice.

35:26.500 --> 35:28.500
- I'll catch up with you guys.

35:34.329 --> 35:36.710
- Hey, I just wanted
to see if you were okay

35:36.710 --> 35:37.500
after your presentation.

35:37.500 --> 35:38.500
That looked pretty
rough up there.

35:38.500 --> 35:40.880
- Were you in on it?

35:41.460 --> 35:42.579
- In on what?

35:43.420 --> 35:46.079
Did something happen?

35:46.079 --> 35:47.250
- Nothing, I'm fine.

35:47.250 --> 35:48.880
- Well, if you're
not busy tonight--

35:48.880 --> 35:50.250
- Sorry, I am.

35:51.039 --> 35:52.750
- Are you mad at me?

35:52.750 --> 35:54.380
- I'm not mad, I just--

35:54.380 --> 35:56.170
- What?

35:56.380 --> 36:00.039
- I don't understand how you
can be friends with Edie.

36:02.000 --> 36:03.500
- I know she can be
hard to get along with.

36:03.500 --> 36:08.170
- No, superfluid vacuum theory
is hard to get along with.

36:08.170 --> 36:09.039
She's just mean.

36:09.039 --> 36:11.079
- Look, Edie and I go way back.

36:11.079 --> 36:12.500
She's had a hard time.

36:12.500 --> 36:14.880
- And so she has to make
sure everyone else does, too?

36:14.880 --> 36:16.380
- You don't know her.

36:16.380 --> 36:18.420
She's hard to get to know,
but she's more than she seems.

36:18.420 --> 36:19.420
I mean, even a
pickle has a light

36:19.420 --> 36:21.619
on the inside if you
give it a chance, right?

36:22.289 --> 36:24.170
Listen, I've got
to get to practice,

36:24.170 --> 36:25.210
but I'll see you around.

36:29.539 --> 36:30.579
- Woo, yeah.

36:32.289 --> 36:33.619
Yeah, good morning.

36:33.619 --> 36:35.789
Today, I thought that
we would try something

36:35.789 --> 36:38.000
a little bit different,

36:38.000 --> 36:39.119
a little bit exciting.

36:40.289 --> 36:41.750
Please give a warm welcome
to our special guests,

36:41.750 --> 36:43.460
the boys' practice
team, the Orcas!

36:49.460 --> 36:51.420
Okay, all right, inspiring,

36:51.420 --> 36:53.750
and now give an
even warmer welcome,

36:53.750 --> 36:56.960
to our very special guests,

36:56.960 --> 36:58.289
the boys' and girls' E Teams!

36:59.210 --> 37:01.119
Let's go, team captains.

37:01.119 --> 37:03.829
Lewis, Edie.

37:03.829 --> 37:04.619
Boys choose girls,
girls choose boys.

37:04.619 --> 37:06.960
- Ladies first.

37:06.960 --> 37:07.460
- Oliver.

37:07.460 --> 37:08.960
- Meredith.

37:09.289 --> 37:10.380
- Cory.

37:10.380 --> 37:11.170
- What?

37:17.000 --> 37:19.380
- George.

37:19.380 --> 37:21.380
- Are you sure you
meant to pick me?

37:22.250 --> 37:23.289
- Why wouldn't I?

37:27.000 --> 37:27.829
- It's your turn.

37:31.539 --> 37:32.329
- Ben.

37:32.329 --> 37:33.380
- Hang on.

37:41.250 --> 37:43.210
- Oliver, I'm open, touch.

37:49.710 --> 37:50.750
Oh my gosh, I'm so sorry,

37:50.750 --> 37:52.329
I didn't realize
you were so close.

37:54.670 --> 37:55.500
Now we're even.

37:57.920 --> 37:59.039
- Hey, are you okay?

37:59.880 --> 38:00.750
- Is this why you picked me?

38:00.750 --> 38:01.670
- What are you talking about?

38:01.670 --> 38:04.460
- So you could embarrass
me in front of everyone?

38:04.460 --> 38:05.880
- It was an accident.

38:05.880 --> 38:08.210
- Yeah, why would I do
something like that on purpose?

38:09.380 --> 38:11.670
- You're exactly
like her, but worse,

38:11.670 --> 38:13.380
because you seem really nice,

38:13.380 --> 38:15.079
but it's just an act,

38:15.079 --> 38:18.829
and then I end up
feeling like an idiot.

38:18.829 --> 38:19.539
- Cory, come on.

38:19.539 --> 38:20.960
- Just leave me alone.

38:23.579 --> 38:24.380
- Cory?

38:28.039 --> 38:29.250
- So what's going on
with you and Sea Girl?

38:29.250 --> 38:31.170
- What do you mean?

38:31.579 --> 38:32.750
- Come on Edie,

38:32.750 --> 38:33.750
I know when I've been
made an accomplice

38:33.750 --> 38:35.039
to a grand theft pickle.

38:36.960 --> 38:37.960
What's your problem with her?

38:37.960 --> 38:39.829
- It's not her, it's Oliver.

38:39.829 --> 38:41.380
He needs to stay
focused this year,

38:41.380 --> 38:43.329
and whenever she comes around
he acts like a total idiot.

38:43.329 --> 38:44.380
- It's not her,

38:44.380 --> 38:46.829
he's always kind of an idiot.

38:46.829 --> 38:47.500
- Why are you defending her?

38:47.500 --> 38:49.119
- She seems nice.

38:50.119 --> 38:51.920
A little weird.

38:51.920 --> 38:53.039
- A little?

38:53.039 --> 38:55.880
She turned a pickle
into a light bulb.

38:55.880 --> 38:57.170
Well, at least she tried to.

38:57.170 --> 38:58.619
- Look, if you want
replace all her belongings

38:58.619 --> 39:00.460
with cucumbers, fine,

39:00.460 --> 39:02.289
just don't make me a
part of it, all right?

39:12.380 --> 39:15.329
- You were close that time.

39:15.329 --> 39:17.420
Well at least you kicked
it in the right direction.

39:17.420 --> 39:18.500
- It's a ball.

39:18.500 --> 39:20.289
Why can't I kick it
where I want it to go?

39:20.289 --> 39:22.710
- Are you really
angry about the ball?

39:22.710 --> 39:24.460
- Yes,

39:24.460 --> 39:25.619
no,

39:25.619 --> 39:29.079
yes but, not just the ball.

39:29.079 --> 39:30.880
- Is it Oliver?

39:31.880 --> 39:32.579
I know you think he's
messing with you,

39:32.579 --> 39:33.750
but he's not like that.

39:33.750 --> 39:37.500
- I just don't get why
he hangs out with her.

39:37.500 --> 39:38.210
- Yeah, life's a mystery.

39:39.329 --> 39:41.380
Why don't we try
something different?

39:41.380 --> 39:42.380
Close your eyes.

39:42.380 --> 39:43.829
- What?

39:43.829 --> 39:45.670
I can't even kick the ball
straight with my eyes open.

39:45.670 --> 39:47.880
- Just trust me.

39:47.880 --> 39:49.250
This is an exercise I
use in my dance classes.

39:49.250 --> 39:51.039
Okay, take a deep breath in,

39:52.119 --> 39:54.579
and slowly release it.

39:54.579 --> 39:57.000
Become aware of your body.

39:57.000 --> 39:58.380
Where are your arms?

39:58.380 --> 40:00.289
Where are your legs?

40:00.289 --> 40:02.829
- Connected to my torso?

40:02.829 --> 40:05.920
- Shh, now open your eyes,

40:05.920 --> 40:08.829
and feel the ball
connect with your foot.

40:16.329 --> 40:17.380
- Score!

40:19.170 --> 40:20.380
And give me five.

40:20.380 --> 40:21.170
- What are you doing?

40:21.170 --> 40:22.920
- It's a victory dance.

40:22.920 --> 40:25.789
We can't exactly use
them in any real games,

40:25.789 --> 40:26.670
so might as well use them now.

40:27.710 --> 40:29.420
Hey, you got the
ball into something.

40:29.420 --> 40:31.460
That's progress.

40:31.460 --> 40:32.920
- What am I doing wrong?

40:34.039 --> 40:36.420
- Maybe you're
thinking too much.

40:36.420 --> 40:38.079
- There's no such thing.

40:38.079 --> 40:41.829
- You spend so much time
inside of your head.

40:41.829 --> 40:43.500
Just let yourself be
present in the moment.

40:43.500 --> 40:45.079
Like when I'm dancing
or playing soccer,

40:45.079 --> 40:48.829
I just feel the rest of
the world falling away.

40:50.170 --> 40:51.579
Just try it.

40:52.420 --> 40:53.289
- Okay.

40:53.289 --> 40:55.000
- So when you get
up to the goal,

40:55.000 --> 40:57.420
take a deep breath
to steady yourself.

40:57.420 --> 40:59.210
Remember, present in the moment.

41:01.119 --> 41:03.210
And when you're
ready, kick the ball,

41:03.210 --> 41:04.500
right to the back of the net.

41:17.170 --> 41:18.539
Are you okay?

41:22.329 --> 41:25.119
On the positive side, you
seem to be pretty flexible.

41:28.789 --> 41:30.079
Wait, what's
happening over there?

41:33.880 --> 41:34.829
- What's going on?

41:34.829 --> 41:36.750
- Caitlin Ford is
coming here, to Harold.

41:36.750 --> 41:38.210
- Oh my gosh.

41:38.210 --> 41:39.460
When, why?

41:39.460 --> 41:40.710
- For this year's
national tournament.

41:40.710 --> 41:42.329
- And Caitlin is
presenting the trophy

41:42.329 --> 41:43.960
to the winning team.

41:43.960 --> 41:45.829
- Who's Caitlin Ford?

41:45.829 --> 41:47.619
- Only the youngest
Australian ever

41:47.619 --> 41:48.920
to compete in the World Cup.

41:48.920 --> 41:50.500
- She plays wing
for the Matildas.

41:50.500 --> 41:51.500
- I'm sure you've seen her play

41:51.500 --> 41:53.829
for the Australian women's team?

41:53.829 --> 41:54.829
Here, have a look.

42:01.460 --> 42:03.079
- It'll be great
seeing Caitlin again

42:03.079 --> 42:05.119
when she hands us the
trophy at the tournament.

42:05.119 --> 42:06.920
We had all the
Matildas at my parents'

42:06.920 --> 42:08.829
end-of-summer yacht party.

42:08.829 --> 42:11.119
- Don't count your chickens
before they hatch, Edie.

42:11.119 --> 42:12.579
- What did you say?

42:12.579 --> 42:14.250
- I'm pretty sure you heard me.

42:14.250 --> 42:17.380
- Oh, I heard you,
but unfortunately I

42:17.380 --> 42:19.420
Can any of you translate?

42:19.420 --> 42:21.539
- Let me make it crystal clear.

42:21.539 --> 42:23.420
No one cares that
you met Caitlin

42:23.420 --> 42:24.710
on your parents' fancy yacht,

42:24.710 --> 42:28.250
or whether or not you think
you'll win this tournament.

42:28.250 --> 42:30.420
Winners are made on the field.

42:30.420 --> 42:32.380
- I've seen you out
there, Sea Girl.

42:32.380 --> 42:34.710
It's also where losers are made.

42:34.710 --> 42:36.710
I'll meet you there any time.

42:36.710 --> 42:38.500
- You will meet us there.

42:38.500 --> 42:39.539
In the finals.

42:40.329 --> 42:41.619
- She's delusional.

42:42.710 --> 42:44.250
I think you've been exposed
to too many chemicals

42:44.250 --> 42:46.170
in your little science lab.

42:46.170 --> 42:47.420
It's melting your brain.

42:49.039 --> 42:50.289
- Okay everyone.

42:52.329 --> 42:55.380
Why don't we just
take a deep breath.

42:55.380 --> 42:57.170
- The only place you'll
be during the finals

42:57.170 --> 42:59.170
is in the stands,
watching me kill it.

43:02.829 --> 43:04.210
- Where did that come from?

43:05.829 --> 43:08.380
- I'm just so sick of the
way she acts all the time.

43:08.380 --> 43:10.880
Who cares if her parents
are big rock stars?

43:10.880 --> 43:13.250
- They're actually TV stars.

43:13.250 --> 43:14.960
- Whatever.

43:14.960 --> 43:17.920
I wouldn't care if her father
was Erwin Schr<font color="magenta"> dinger himself.</font>

43:17.920 --> 43:20.329
It doesn't make her the
queen of the school.

43:20.329 --> 43:21.119
- Shroding-who?

43:22.170 --> 43:23.829
- Erwin Schr<font color="magenta"> dinger?</font>

43:23.829 --> 43:25.880
Nobel Prize winner?

43:25.880 --> 43:27.960
He formulated the wave equation.

43:27.960 --> 43:29.920
- Just google it
later, she's on a roll.

43:29.920 --> 43:32.039
- I'm just not putting
up with it any more.

43:32.039 --> 43:34.289
- Does that mean you're
gonna play in the tournament?

43:36.500 --> 43:39.460
- It means we're going to
beat her in the tournament.

43:40.619 --> 43:41.420
Come on.

43:43.579 --> 43:45.289
- My team,

43:45.289 --> 43:46.079
why aren't you warming up?

43:46.079 --> 43:47.460
- Coach Smith,

43:47.460 --> 43:48.789
how long have you been coaching

43:48.789 --> 43:50.250
the practice team
here at Harold?

43:50.250 --> 43:52.119
- Going on 20 years.

43:52.119 --> 43:55.460
- And how long has it been
since you guys won a game?

43:57.710 --> 43:59.460
- Going on 20 years.

43:59.460 --> 44:02.289
- What happens next year if
they cut the practice team?

44:04.460 --> 44:06.000
What if we could change that?

44:06.000 --> 44:08.289
- Well, I'd say that you're
not gonna become winners

44:08.289 --> 44:10.170
by sitting around, so.

44:11.670 --> 44:13.380
But I'll give you five minutes.

44:14.420 --> 44:18.250
- Okay, so I got this
idea in science class.

44:18.250 --> 44:20.420
Have you guys ever
heard of magnus force?

44:20.420 --> 44:22.000
- Sounds like something
Superman would use

44:22.000 --> 44:23.460
to crush his enemies.

44:23.460 --> 44:25.579
- Or you could use
it to crush yours.

44:25.579 --> 44:28.170
Magnus force describes
how a spinning cylinder

44:28.170 --> 44:29.789
or sphere moves through the air.

44:30.920 --> 44:33.170
In this case, a soccer ball.

44:33.170 --> 44:35.710
See, depending on
which side you kick

44:35.710 --> 44:37.170
and the force you apply,

44:37.170 --> 44:39.500
you create unequal drag
on the upper and lower

44:39.500 --> 44:40.829
surfaces of the ball,

44:40.829 --> 44:43.170
which causes it to arc
one way or the other.

44:43.170 --> 44:45.920
In layman's terms, this
is how Beckham bends it.

44:45.920 --> 44:47.420
- Cool.

44:47.420 --> 44:49.329
- My theory is that
if you learn how to

44:49.329 --> 44:51.289
visualize the variables
inside your head,

44:51.289 --> 44:53.039
you can calculate
the perfect kick

44:53.039 --> 44:55.289
and get it in the
goal every time.

44:55.289 --> 44:56.710
- That's awesome.

44:56.710 --> 44:58.579
- It's like a whole other
level to playing the game.

44:58.579 --> 45:01.420
- And we need to go
to the next level.

45:01.420 --> 45:05.250
That's why you're going to
design all new uniforms for us.

45:05.250 --> 45:07.250
- Wait, I am?

45:07.250 --> 45:10.170
- If we want to be winners,
we have to act like winners,

45:10.170 --> 45:12.460
which means dressing
like winners,

45:12.460 --> 45:14.380
with uniforms that
don't slow us down.

45:14.380 --> 45:16.539
- Something breathable
and stretchy,

45:16.539 --> 45:17.960
but chic and on trend.

45:17.960 --> 45:20.460
- So we don't have to look
like we're stuck in 1995.

45:20.460 --> 45:21.250
- Exactly.

45:21.250 --> 45:22.880
- Sounds like you'll be busy.

45:22.880 --> 45:23.670
- So will you.

45:27.420 --> 45:28.750
- Coach's playbook?

45:28.750 --> 45:30.960
- I mean, It would
be a playbook,

45:30.960 --> 45:32.119
if we had a playbook,

45:32.119 --> 45:35.420
and not just a pile
of disorganized paper.

45:35.420 --> 45:36.289
- Oh, right.

45:36.289 --> 45:37.500
- Sorry, no offense.

45:38.539 --> 45:40.579
How are we supposed to
figure out our plays,

45:40.579 --> 45:43.460
if we can't figure
out where to get them?

45:43.460 --> 45:46.210
Charlotte, do you think you
could organize these for us?

45:47.079 --> 45:48.289
- A project!

45:48.289 --> 45:50.539
- Okay, so we have science,

45:50.539 --> 45:53.039
fashion and organization
on our side.

45:54.289 --> 45:55.789
But the E Team has Edie.

45:55.789 --> 45:57.329
How are we supposed to beat her?

45:58.460 --> 46:00.460
- By believing that we can.

46:00.460 --> 46:04.119
Janessa, I never managed to
make a kick before in my life,

46:04.119 --> 46:06.210
before you taught me
how to visualize it.

46:06.210 --> 46:08.539
If you could do that for
the rest of the team.

46:09.579 --> 46:11.289
- We could really have a shot.

46:11.289 --> 46:13.460
- Excuse me, I think we're
forgetting something.

46:13.460 --> 46:15.420
There will be no changes,

46:15.420 --> 46:17.119
to the uniforms,
to the playbook,

46:17.119 --> 46:19.829
or to the practice, unless
the coach signs off on it.

46:21.289 --> 46:24.460
I'm totally kidding, I think
they're wonderful ideas.

46:25.329 --> 46:27.420
Got ya, didn't I?

46:27.420 --> 46:28.380
- One, two, three.

46:28.380 --> 46:30.039
- WOTB!

46:31.880 --> 46:34.460
- I'm so inspirational.

46:34.460 --> 46:37.250
- Wonder what's
going on over there?

46:37.250 --> 46:38.579
- Maybe we should
go check it out.

46:38.579 --> 46:41.420
- You know maybe, Cory
could fill you in.

46:41.420 --> 46:43.250
Come on man, focus up.

46:44.380 --> 46:45.329
The girls are watching.

46:53.789 --> 46:56.119
- Mom? Dad?

46:56.119 --> 46:57.000
- Kitten Britches?

47:00.619 --> 47:02.829
- I've been trying
to reach you guys.

47:02.829 --> 47:04.000
- Sorry sweetheart,

47:04.000 --> 47:06.210
it's been hard to get
a connection out here.

47:06.210 --> 47:07.960
How are you holding up?

47:07.960 --> 47:09.119
- I'm okay.

47:09.119 --> 47:11.000
- Well get ready to
be better than okay.

47:11.000 --> 47:13.500
We figured out a way to get
you out of soccer purgatory.

47:13.500 --> 47:14.539
- Even though we think

47:14.539 --> 47:16.460
a well-rounded
education is important,

47:16.460 --> 47:18.380
and sports is great for
your cardiovascular health.

47:18.380 --> 47:20.000
- We found an
international school

47:20.000 --> 47:21.829
nearby our medical station.

47:21.829 --> 47:23.920
It has a terrific
science program,

47:23.920 --> 47:26.170
and we can see each
other on the weekends.

47:26.170 --> 47:28.170
- Oh, wow.

47:28.170 --> 47:29.329
- What's wrong?

47:29.329 --> 47:32.039
- Nothing, nothing's wrong.

47:32.039 --> 47:34.289
- Well, we thought you'd
be excited, sweetheart.

47:35.289 --> 47:36.500
- Can you guys hear me?

47:51.829 --> 47:53.210
Nice acoustics.

47:57.119 --> 48:01.210
And the winner of the
Nobel Prize for Physics is

48:01.210 --> 48:02.960
Corinne Elizabeth Bailey.

48:07.460 --> 48:09.670
- Yeah congratulations,
it's just,

48:09.670 --> 48:11.329
I just really want you to come.

48:12.380 --> 48:13.920
It's a big deal to me.

48:14.119 --> 48:16.539
I don't understand why you
can't come down for one day.

48:18.079 --> 48:20.289
There are teams coming
from all over the country.

48:22.039 --> 48:23.670
Don't say you'll
make it up to me.

48:24.710 --> 48:27.170
You and dad say that all
the time but you never do.

48:28.880 --> 48:30.789
It's just another
show for you but,

48:30.789 --> 48:32.250
this is a big deal for me.

48:36.119 --> 48:38.539
Caitlin's gonna hand out
the trophy to the winner.

48:38.539 --> 48:41.000
Maybe it would be a good
photo op for you guys.

48:44.500 --> 48:47.250
No, we haven't won yet
but, I'm sure my team will.

48:49.119 --> 48:52.539
Yes, I know you can't shut down
production for a maybe but,

48:52.539 --> 48:54.289
you guys haven't
seen me play in ages.

48:58.000 --> 48:58.789
Yeah okay.

49:00.000 --> 49:00.829
I get it.

49:02.210 --> 49:03.579
I'll see you on holidays then.

49:05.329 --> 49:07.500
Okay, tell Dad I love him.

49:08.329 --> 49:09.250
All right, bye.

49:13.380 --> 49:14.960
- Hey, what's up?

49:14.960 --> 49:16.500
- What do you want?

49:16.500 --> 49:18.920
- Nothing just, you know.

49:18.920 --> 49:20.289
Keeping it clean and mean.

49:24.329 --> 49:25.329
- Nice shoes, loser.

49:25.329 --> 49:28.170
- Yeah, my Dad got them for me.

49:28.170 --> 49:30.000
He said he had to buy them

49:30.000 --> 49:31.619
'cause they really
quacked him up.

49:33.170 --> 49:34.750
Normally, I wouldn't wear them,

49:34.750 --> 49:37.210
but I've been really
missing my parents, so.

49:38.670 --> 49:39.460
I just mean,

49:40.619 --> 49:43.539
I know what it's like when
your parents are gone a lot.

49:43.539 --> 49:45.750
My parents won't get
to see me play either.

49:48.289 --> 49:50.460
- Were you listening
in to my call?

49:50.460 --> 49:51.829
- Not on purpose, I'm sorry.

49:51.829 --> 49:53.250
I was just trying to help.

49:53.250 --> 49:54.329
- I don't need your help.

49:56.119 --> 49:57.920
And you want to know
something, Sea Girl?

49:59.170 --> 50:00.460
You don't belong here.

50:00.460 --> 50:01.579
You're terrible at soccer,

50:01.579 --> 50:03.750
you're dragging your whole
team down, and Oliver just--

50:03.750 --> 50:05.960
- What about Oliver?

50:05.960 --> 50:07.829
- He doesn't need
you distracting him.

50:09.000 --> 50:11.329
So why don't you do everyone
a favor and go home?

50:33.920 --> 50:37.500
- Hey, I hear you
guys are trying

50:37.500 --> 50:40.210
some cool new science
stuff on the field.

50:40.210 --> 50:42.539
- Yeah, they are.

50:42.539 --> 50:44.210
- They?

50:44.210 --> 50:45.079
- The team.

50:46.380 --> 50:47.539
- You're not part of the team?

50:47.539 --> 50:48.329
- Not anymore.

50:49.500 --> 50:50.289
I'm leaving.

50:51.460 --> 50:52.250
- Why?

50:53.079 --> 50:54.250
- Don't worry about it.

50:55.079 --> 50:57.000
You should stay
focused on the game.

50:58.960 --> 51:01.039
I know it's important to you.

51:01.039 --> 51:01.829
- Cory, wait.

51:03.079 --> 51:03.880
Cory?

51:10.500 --> 51:12.329
- What do you mean she
leaves in the morning?

51:12.329 --> 51:14.460
- Oliver said her parents
found a new school for her.

51:14.460 --> 51:16.579
- But she already has
a school, this school.

51:16.579 --> 51:18.420
- Something must be going on.

51:18.420 --> 51:20.539
- I bet anything
Edie is behind it.

51:20.539 --> 51:21.789
- So what can we do?

51:21.789 --> 51:23.500
- We talk to her,
convince her to stay.

51:23.500 --> 51:25.250
- I've already tried.

51:25.250 --> 51:26.289
Her mind is made up.

51:26.289 --> 51:27.539
- Did she say why?

51:27.539 --> 51:30.039
- Just that she thinks
that we don't need her.

51:30.039 --> 51:31.329
- Well, she's wrong.

51:31.329 --> 51:34.539
- Okay, but what can we do
if she won't listen to us?

51:34.539 --> 51:36.170
- We show her.

51:36.170 --> 51:36.960
Come on.

51:36.960 --> 51:38.079
You have some sewing to do.

51:46.289 --> 51:48.539
- Hey, I was just finishing up.

51:51.250 --> 51:52.250
What is this?

52:04.079 --> 52:05.039
They're pickles!

52:11.210 --> 52:12.460
Is that supposed to be me?

52:15.960 --> 52:17.380
Yep, that's me.

52:22.039 --> 52:24.000
And they're glowing
because of me?

52:24.000 --> 52:26.000
- You're our sodium chloride.

52:26.000 --> 52:27.380
We can't glow without you.

52:29.710 --> 52:30.920
- I don't know what to say.

52:30.920 --> 52:32.170
- So, say you'll stay,

52:32.170 --> 52:35.250
because in real life,
we can't replace you.

52:35.250 --> 52:37.079
- We can't do this
without you, Cory.

52:38.460 --> 52:39.880
Your friends need you here.

52:41.670 --> 52:42.460
- Friends?

52:47.079 --> 52:48.789
I have friends.

52:48.789 --> 52:49.960
- So what do you say?

52:51.000 --> 52:52.039
Will you stay?

52:55.829 --> 52:59.000
- How can I say no to a
bunch of dancing pickles?

- Okay you're looking
magnificent my team,

54:50.039 --> 54:52.460
let's practice some
penalty kicks, let's go.

54:56.619 --> 54:58.380
Beautiful.

54:58.380 --> 54:59.039
Okay, let's go.

54:59.039 --> 55:00.079
Go again.

55:04.119 --> 55:05.000
Okay Cory, you're up.

55:05.000 --> 55:06.380
This one's yours.

55:09.500 --> 55:12.500
So close, centimeters
away from brilliant.

55:12.500 --> 55:15.119
All right, all right
let's keep it going.

55:15.119 --> 55:16.960
Get in there, Janessa.

55:19.500 --> 55:21.460
- So it's a two-day tournament,

55:21.460 --> 55:22.829
which will be good for us

55:22.829 --> 55:24.119
because we'll be up against
the lower-seeded teams

55:24.119 --> 55:26.210
in the first half of the day.

55:26.210 --> 55:28.579
- But practice teams
don't make it to day two.

55:30.039 --> 55:32.079
- You guys, that's
not gonna be us.

55:33.579 --> 55:37.000
And I hope you've all been
practicing our victory dance,

55:37.000 --> 55:38.710
because we're going to need it.

55:39.880 --> 55:41.039
One, two, three.

55:41.039 --> 55:41.829
- WOTB!

55:43.500 --> 55:45.000
- Hey ho, let's go.

55:45.000 --> 55:47.039
Hey ho, let's go.

55:47.039 --> 55:48.539
Hey ho, let's go.

55:49.579 --> 55:51.170
Hey ho, let's go.

55:51.170 --> 55:53.039
Hey ho, let's go.

55:53.039 --> 55:54.579
Hey ho, let's go.

56:01.039 --> 56:02.829
Hey yo, here we go.

56:02.829 --> 56:04.789
Hey yo, here we go.

56:04.789 --> 56:07.039
Hey yo, here we go.

56:07.039 --> 56:08.170
Here we go.

56:13.579 --> 56:15.380
One, two, three, four.

56:20.000 --> 56:23.210
- Good follow through,
follow through.

56:26.920 --> 56:28.420
- Come on, Janessa.

56:31.000 --> 56:32.920
- Hey yo, here we go.

56:32.920 --> 56:34.920
Hey yo, here we go.

56:34.920 --> 56:38.880
Hey yo, here we go.

56:38.880 --> 56:40.750
Hey yo, here we go.

56:40.750 --> 56:42.710
Hey yo, here we go.

56:42.710 --> 56:44.170
Hey yo, here we go.

56:45.119 --> 56:46.039
Here we go.

57:03.579 --> 57:06.079
- That's it, she's free pass.

57:08.880 --> 57:09.789
Go Janessa.

57:11.039 --> 57:12.710
- Hey yo, here we go.

57:12.710 --> 57:14.500
Hey yo, here we go.

57:23.119 --> 57:23.880
- It's working.

57:23.880 --> 57:24.670
- Right.

57:35.170 --> 57:36.619
- Hey yo, here we go.

57:36.619 --> 57:38.670
Hey yo, here we go.

57:38.670 --> 57:41.170
Hey yo, here we go.

57:41.170 --> 57:42.079
Here we go.

57:43.119 --> 57:44.619
Hey yo, here we go.

57:44.619 --> 57:46.619
Hey yo, here we go.

57:46.619 --> 57:49.079
Hey yo, here we go.

57:49.079 --> 57:50.039
Here we go.

58:05.250 --> 58:07.039
One, two, three, four.

58:39.210 --> 58:40.579
Hey yo, here we go.

58:40.579 --> 58:42.539
Hey yo, here we go.

58:42.539 --> 58:45.079
Hey yo, here we go.

58:45.079 --> 58:46.000
Here we go.

58:49.000 --> 58:51.789
Congratulations ,

58:51.789 --> 58:53.289
Harold Academy E Team,

58:53.289 --> 58:55.500
and for the first
time in 20 years,

58:55.500 --> 58:57.039
the Harold Academy
Practice Team,

58:57.039 --> 59:00.880
will go head-to-head
in the finals tomorrow.

59:01.289 --> 59:02.619
- Can you believe
what we just did?

59:02.619 --> 59:03.539
- It worked.

59:03.539 --> 59:05.079
I had the whole Magnus
thing in my head

59:05.079 --> 59:08.119
and it was like
bam, pow, swoosh!

59:08.119 --> 59:09.920
Right into the goal.

59:09.920 --> 59:12.619
- We made it to the finals
for the national tournament.

59:12.619 --> 59:14.039
That's sick!

59:14.039 --> 59:16.579
- And, I'm not gonna lie,
we looked great doing it.

59:16.579 --> 59:17.579
- One, two, three.

59:17.579 --> 59:18.380
- WOTB!

59:31.329 --> 59:32.829
- Finals, here we come.

59:32.829 --> 59:34.250
- I can't believe
I'm gonna say this,

59:34.250 --> 59:36.170
but don't wash your
socks, Janessa.

59:36.170 --> 59:37.500
We need all the
luck we can get if

59:37.500 --> 59:38.670
we're gonna beat the E team.

59:38.670 --> 59:40.619
- Lucky for you, I am
not taking these off

59:40.619 --> 59:42.329
until after the tournament.

59:42.329 --> 59:43.789
- Somebody crack a window.

59:45.289 --> 59:47.539
- Guys, we don't need luck,

59:47.539 --> 59:49.500
and I'm not afraid of Edie.

59:49.500 --> 59:51.329
- Did you guys see her today?

59:51.329 --> 59:53.039
I think she's afraid of us.

59:53.039 --> 59:54.170
- Forget Edie.

59:54.170 --> 59:57.119
Did you see Oliver
watching us today?

59:57.119 --> 01:00:00.119
- I don't think he
was watching us.

01:00:03.829 --> 01:00:05.880
- When are you guys
gonna give it up?

01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:08.000
- He even wears
out jersey color.

01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.289
- So, yellow suits
his complexion.

01:00:11.670 --> 01:00:14.960
- Oh, so you've noticed
his complexion have you?

01:00:16.039 --> 01:00:19.079
- Whatever, I'm a scientist.

01:00:19.079 --> 01:00:20.500
I observe things.

01:00:20.500 --> 01:00:21.380
It's like my job.

01:00:25.619 --> 01:00:29.960
Oh look, I just observed that
my water bottle is empty.

01:00:29.960 --> 01:00:30.829
I gotta stay hydrated.

01:00:30.829 --> 01:00:32.000
Better go fill this up.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.380
Anybody else? Nope? Okay, bye.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:41.380
Totally busted.

01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:42.750
- Totally busted for what?

01:00:43.880 --> 01:00:44.960
- Where, how?

01:00:46.539 --> 01:00:49.829
Oh my gosh, you're everywhere.

01:00:49.829 --> 01:00:50.920
- Well, I'm not everywhere,

01:00:50.920 --> 01:00:52.920
but I am here, to
see you, actually.

01:00:52.920 --> 01:00:54.619
I was just dropping
by to see if you want

01:00:54.619 --> 01:00:56.170
to grab a fizzy
drink or something.

01:00:58.500 --> 01:00:59.829
- I have my water bottle.

01:01:01.039 --> 01:01:05.619
- Okay, well good luck
in the finals tomorrow.

01:01:05.619 --> 01:01:06.420
- Wait!

01:01:08.079 --> 01:01:10.329
I guess one soda couldn't hurt.

01:01:12.119 --> 01:01:14.039
- So everything's
looking really promising.

01:01:14.039 --> 01:01:16.289
- So does that mean
they're interested?

01:01:16.289 --> 01:01:19.039
- Yeah, scouts from three
clubs came up to talk to me.

01:01:19.039 --> 01:01:21.250
They're meeting with my
coaches after the tournament.

01:01:21.250 --> 01:01:23.420
- That's awesome,
I'm so happy for you.

01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:25.119
- You know what else is awesome?

01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:26.329
That kick today.

01:01:26.329 --> 01:01:28.039
I swear that ball took
a perpendicular turn

01:01:28.039 --> 01:01:29.329
between Charlotte's
foot and the net.

01:01:29.329 --> 01:01:32.079
- I told you, it's just physics.

01:01:32.079 --> 01:01:34.750
It makes perfect sense
once you know how to do it.

01:01:34.750 --> 01:01:36.579
- Soccer I can talk to
you about all day long,

01:01:36.579 --> 01:01:39.210
but when you get to
physics, you lose me.

01:01:40.250 --> 01:01:41.670
- Okay, watch.

01:01:44.289 --> 01:01:47.210
So here's the goal, okay?

01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:48.000
- Sure.

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.289
- And here's the ball.

01:01:50.289 --> 01:01:52.210
A lot of players know
how to bend the ball,

01:01:52.210 --> 01:01:54.960
but for for less
experienced players,

01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:57.670
accuracy can be a problem right?

01:01:57.670 --> 01:01:59.579
Until you understand the science

01:01:59.579 --> 01:02:01.960
of what causes the ball
to change direction.

01:02:01.960 --> 01:02:04.079
Imagine a rocket blasting off.

01:02:04.079 --> 01:02:06.250
The gas is shooting
down out of the rocket,

01:02:06.250 --> 01:02:07.579
which pushes it up.

01:02:07.579 --> 01:02:09.880
It's the same with
a spinning ball.

01:02:09.880 --> 01:02:12.170
The air going in the
direction of the spin

01:02:12.170 --> 01:02:14.329
goes around the ball
and pushes to the side

01:02:14.329 --> 01:02:16.420
like the gas coming
out of a rocket,

01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:18.460
so the air on the
other side of the ball

01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:20.579
has to push back and,

01:02:22.170 --> 01:02:23.079
blast off.

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:26.289
The ball bends and goes
straight into the net.

01:02:28.170 --> 01:02:30.210
- You get so excited when
you talk about science.

01:02:30.210 --> 01:02:33.119
- Well, I mean it's
pretty exciting stuff.

01:02:33.119 --> 01:02:34.289
Some things you can predict,

01:02:34.289 --> 01:02:35.539
but some things,
you have no clue

01:02:35.539 --> 01:02:38.039
what's going to happen
till you test your theory.

01:02:39.289 --> 01:02:41.710
- Yeah, sometimes you
have to test your theory.

01:02:44.170 --> 01:02:45.329
- Uh huh.

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:47.619
I don't know if I can trust you.

01:02:47.619 --> 01:02:48.420
- Why not?

01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.420
- Every time I see
you, you're with Edie.

01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:54.750
- I'm not with Edie right now.

01:02:54.750 --> 01:02:56.039
- I just don't get it.

01:02:57.380 --> 01:02:59.500
- I told you, she's more
than what she seems.

01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:02.039
- Did you two used
to date or something?

01:03:02.039 --> 01:03:02.829
- No.

01:03:02.829 --> 01:03:03.670
- Are you seeing her now?

01:03:03.670 --> 01:03:05.119
- No, what do I have to do

01:03:05.119 --> 01:03:07.039
to get you to see
that I like you?

01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.380
- It doesn't matter anyway.

01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:14.380
I can't have any
distractions right now.

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:16.789
Neither of us can.

01:03:16.789 --> 01:03:18.329
- I'm not trying
to distract you.

01:03:18.329 --> 01:03:20.170
- Good, then you understand.

01:03:22.039 --> 01:03:25.170
- Oh, let me at least
walk you to your dorm.

01:03:25.170 --> 01:03:28.079
- I think I'd rather just
be alone and clear my head,

01:03:28.079 --> 01:03:29.539
for the big game, you know?

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:31.250
- Yeah, okay.

01:03:31.250 --> 01:03:33.119
Good luck tomorrow.

01:03:33.119 --> 01:03:33.920
- Thanks.

01:04:13.210 --> 01:04:15.000
- Hey.

01:04:17.579 --> 01:04:18.710
- You scared me.

01:04:20.119 --> 01:04:22.039
- Where were you?

01:04:22.039 --> 01:04:24.380
We were gonna organize
a search party.

01:04:24.380 --> 01:04:26.460
But then everybody fell asleep.

01:04:28.210 --> 01:04:30.539
- Oliver.

01:04:30.539 --> 01:04:31.880
- What happened?

01:04:31.880 --> 01:04:34.119
- I think he was
about to kiss me.

01:04:34.119 --> 01:04:35.880
- About to?

01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:38.119
- But then I basically
accused him of either

01:04:38.119 --> 01:04:42.289
spying for Edie or
dating her, or both.

01:04:42.289 --> 01:04:44.119
- Yeah, that wouldn't do it.

01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:48.079
Are you okay?

01:04:48.079 --> 01:04:49.119
- Yeah, I'm fine.

01:04:49.119 --> 01:04:52.000
Now go back to bed.

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.539
We have to kick
Edie's butt tomorrow.

01:04:54.539 --> 01:04:56.170
- You should take
your own advice.

01:04:56.170 --> 01:04:59.579
- I will, promise, okay?

01:05:00.750 --> 01:05:01.539
- Sleep well.

01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.710
- Welcome
parents, alumni,

01:05:18.710 --> 01:05:20.710
students and visitors.

01:05:20.710 --> 01:05:23.750
Today is the day we
have been waiting for.

01:05:23.750 --> 01:05:26.289
Our Harold Academy
National Tournament Final

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:27.579
is here at last.

01:05:28.329 --> 01:05:31.170
Today's game should
be very exciting

01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:33.789
and will be topped off
by an awards presentation

01:05:33.789 --> 01:05:36.460
from the international
soccer legend, Caitlin Ford.

01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:42.789
Cheers to the
participating teams!

01:05:42.789 --> 01:05:47.420
- E Team, E Team, E Team,
E Team, E Team, E Team.

01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:48.920
- All right guys, circle up.

01:05:53.039 --> 01:05:54.500
When we go out there today,

01:05:54.500 --> 01:05:56.420
they're gonna discount
us because they think

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.329
we're just the practice team.

01:05:58.329 --> 01:05:59.880
Well guess what?

01:05:59.880 --> 01:06:01.539
Practice is over.

01:06:03.289 --> 01:06:06.119
This is it, this is when all
of our hard work comes together

01:06:06.119 --> 01:06:09.170
and we show everyone at this
school that we are champions.

01:06:09.170 --> 01:06:12.460
- Now let's get out
there on the field and--

01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:19.420
- One, two, three, WOTB!

01:06:23.829 --> 01:06:24.619
- Yeah.

01:06:26.670 --> 01:06:28.960
Yes, I am so inspirational.

01:06:32.119 --> 01:06:33.460
- Wait, what are you doing?

01:06:33.460 --> 01:06:35.250
- I forgot my water bottle,
I'll be right there.

01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:36.170
- Hurry up.

01:06:54.119 --> 01:06:56.170
- Hello?

01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:00.500
Hello?

01:07:01.119 --> 01:07:04.380
- E Team, E Team, E Team.

01:07:04.380 --> 01:07:05.329
- Five
minutes to kick off.

01:07:05.329 --> 01:07:07.920
Harold Academy's own E Team

01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:11.710
versus the practice team
for the championship.

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:15.619
- Hello?

01:07:15.619 --> 01:07:16.880
Is somebody there?

01:07:16.880 --> 01:07:17.579
Please.

01:07:17.579 --> 01:07:19.170
I'm stuck.

01:07:21.119 --> 01:07:22.500
- Nice shirt.

01:07:22.500 --> 01:07:23.289
- Like it?

01:07:23.289 --> 01:07:25.920
Hey, where's Cory?

01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.250
- Dunno, maybe
she chickened out.

01:07:28.250 --> 01:07:30.000
- Hey Janessa, is Cory coming?

01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.380
- I don't know, she said she
was getting her water bottle.

01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:34.079
If she's not out here
before the game starts,

01:07:34.079 --> 01:07:35.960
she's gonna be
disqualified from play.

01:07:38.920 --> 01:07:39.710
- Where's Cory?

01:07:39.710 --> 01:07:41.670
- I don't know.

01:07:57.500 --> 01:07:58.619
- Help!

01:07:58.619 --> 01:08:00.750
Is anybody out there?

01:08:00.750 --> 01:08:01.539
Please!

01:08:01.539 --> 01:08:02.460
- Cory?
- I'm locked in the bathroom.

01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:03.039
Hello?

01:08:03.039 --> 01:08:03.960
- Cory?

01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:04.750
- Oliver?

01:08:04.750 --> 01:08:06.250
- How did you lock yourself in?

01:08:06.250 --> 01:08:07.619
- I didn't.

01:08:07.619 --> 01:08:08.289
- Okay, where's the key?

01:08:08.289 --> 01:08:10.250
- How should I know?

01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.960
- The game's about to start.

01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:25.828
You won't be able to play
if you don't get out there.

01:08:25.828 --> 01:08:28.210
- But the girls need me!

01:08:28.210 --> 01:08:29.618
We're a team, WOTB.

01:08:29.618 --> 01:08:30.538
- I'll go get someone.

01:08:30.538 --> 01:08:33.250
- There's no time.

01:08:33.250 --> 01:08:34.078
- Stand back.

01:08:36.170 --> 01:08:37.828
- That sounds like it hurt.

01:08:37.828 --> 01:08:39.250
- Nope, I'm good.

01:08:43.038 --> 01:08:44.538
- Wait!

01:08:44.538 --> 01:08:49.328
We can't start the game without
singing the anthem first.

01:08:49.328 --> 01:08:50.380
- What are you talking about?

01:08:50.380 --> 01:08:51.380
We don't sing the anthem.

01:08:51.380 --> 01:08:54.000
- Well, it's about
time we start.

01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:55.078

in for one of your teammates,

01:12:00.880 --> 01:12:03.210
and give someone a bit
of a break for a minute?

01:12:03.210 --> 01:12:05.250

01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:06.710

According to the rules
of the tournament,

01:13:42.380 --> 01:13:45.420
we will be going straight
into a penalty shootout.

01:13:51.119 --> 01:13:51.920
- Janessa?

01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:55.750
- No.

01:13:56.579 --> 01:13:57.710
- Are you okay?

01:13:57.710 --> 01:14:00.500
- I think it's sprained.

01:14:00.500 --> 01:14:02.329
Cory, you have to take my place.

01:14:02.329 --> 01:14:04.750
- Now? I can't.

01:14:04.750 --> 01:14:07.380
I've never made a
penalty kick in my life.

01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:08.500
Somebody else.

01:14:08.500 --> 01:14:11.119
- No, you.

01:14:11.119 --> 01:14:12.250
- You brought us here.

01:14:12.250 --> 01:14:15.039
- None of us would
be here without you.

01:14:15.039 --> 01:14:15.829
- But--

01:14:15.829 --> 01:14:17.079
- Listen to me.

01:14:17.079 --> 01:14:20.079
Just a few short weeks
ago, you were Sea Girl.

01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:22.789
Just a science
brain with no idea

01:14:22.789 --> 01:14:23.619
what she was doing
at a soccer camp.

01:14:25.880 --> 01:14:27.920
But Cory, you're so
much more than that.

01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:29.829
You're a dancer.

01:14:29.829 --> 01:14:30.880
- A swimmer.

01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:31.500
- A soccer player.

01:14:31.500 --> 01:14:32.789
- And our friend.

01:14:34.210 --> 01:14:35.829
You've come so far,

01:14:35.829 --> 01:14:37.619
but you only have
one more step to go.

01:14:37.619 --> 01:14:39.670
You can do this.

01:14:39.670 --> 01:14:43.250
The only person who
doesn't believe it, is you.

01:14:54.170 --> 01:14:54.920
- Put me in.

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:55.880

- Good job, you do the rest.

01:16:13.829 --> 01:16:15.500
- I can't take
another round of this.

01:16:15.500 --> 01:16:17.670
- Then you better get it in.

01:16:23.039 --> 01:16:23.789
- Come on, come on.

01:16:36.789 --> 01:16:38.420

be present in the moment.

01:16:38.420 --> 01:16:40.670

01:18:43.960 --> 01:18:45.329
I don't have time for
your games right now.

01:18:45.329 --> 01:18:47.789
- Fine, forget about it.

01:18:47.789 --> 01:18:48.289
I knew it was stupid anyway.

01:18:50.170 --> 01:18:52.539

01:18:52.539 --> 01:18:53.329

01:18:53.329 --> 01:18:55.750

01:19:01.619 --> 01:19:03.670
- I said, congratulations.

01:19:03.670 --> 01:19:05.539
You guys were really
good out there today.

01:19:05.539 --> 01:19:06.789
- Thank you.

01:19:06.789 --> 01:19:08.829
- And I was wondering
if you could teach me

01:19:08.829 --> 01:19:10.710
some of that soccer
physics stuff?

01:19:10.710 --> 01:19:11.710
- Oh really?

01:19:11.710 --> 01:19:13.710
But I thought you
knew everything

01:19:13.710 --> 01:19:14.750
there was to know about soccer.

01:19:14.750 --> 01:19:16.289
- I do, but I don't
know everything

01:19:16.289 --> 01:19:18.119
there is to know about science.

01:19:18.119 --> 01:19:20.250
You know we might actually
make a killer team.

01:19:20.250 --> 01:19:23.000
- Hmm, well you
have a ways to go

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.039
before you could
make it on my team,

01:19:25.039 --> 01:19:26.539
but if you're willing to work,

01:19:26.539 --> 01:19:28.579
come by our practice
tomorrow after school.

01:19:28.579 --> 01:19:30.750
- All right loser, see you then.

01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.789
- Edie, wait.

01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:39.329
- Why? Why do you have
such a problem with me?

01:19:40.670 --> 01:19:43.920
- Oliver and I have been friends
since we were little kids,

01:19:43.920 --> 01:19:45.039
and I think I was afraid

01:19:45.039 --> 01:19:46.750
you were gonna take
him away from me.

01:19:46.750 --> 01:19:47.539
- What?

01:19:47.539 --> 01:19:49.000
- Not romantically.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.789
He's like a brother to me,
it's just, I'm not like you.

01:19:52.789 --> 01:19:53.960
I don't have a lot of friends.

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.210
I have to hold on to
the few that I do have.

01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:01.250
- I didn't used to be like me,
either, with lots of friends.

01:20:01.250 --> 01:20:04.289
But every day is chance to be
someone you weren't yesterday.

01:20:04.289 --> 01:20:05.829
What are you doing right now?

01:20:05.829 --> 01:20:07.750
- Nothing.

01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:08.460
- Come on.

01:20:08.460 --> 01:20:09.619
- Where are we going?

01:20:09.619 --> 01:20:11.539
- We're going to make
some new friends.

01:20:12.329 --> 01:20:13.119
- That your phone?

01:20:18.619 --> 01:20:20.170
- I'm sorry, I
have to take this.

01:20:25.880 --> 01:20:27.250
Hi guys!

01:20:27.250 --> 01:20:29.460
- We're sorry we've been
out of contact for so long.

01:20:29.460 --> 01:20:30.880
- The power lines
went down out here

01:20:30.880 --> 01:20:32.539
and it's been a real mess.

01:20:32.539 --> 01:20:33.670
- But guess what?

01:20:33.670 --> 01:20:34.710
It'll take a couple of weeks

01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:36.289
to finish processing
your enrollment,

01:20:36.289 --> 01:20:37.789
but there's a spot available

01:20:37.789 --> 01:20:39.920
at that international
school we told you about.

01:20:39.920 --> 01:20:41.579
You can leave tonight!

01:20:49.579 --> 01:20:50.380
Cory?

01:20:51.380 --> 01:20:53.500
- Listen up everyone.

01:20:53.500 --> 01:20:56.829
I just received official
word from the school.

01:20:56.829 --> 01:20:59.250
The practice teams
won't be back next year.

01:21:00.380 --> 01:21:04.789
They're being combined
with the other teams.

01:21:04.789 --> 01:21:08.750
So everyone will play
together in the same squad!

01:21:11.670 --> 01:21:12.460
- Cory?

01:21:13.880 --> 01:21:16.380
- Sorry, what were you saying?

01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:19.880
- We're gonna spring you from
that joint, Kitten Britches.

01:21:19.880 --> 01:21:22.750
- Oh, about that, didn't
you get my message?

01:21:22.750 --> 01:21:24.619
I think I want to stay here.

01:21:24.619 --> 01:21:25.500
- Are you sure?

01:21:28.619 --> 01:21:29.380
- I'm sure.

01:21:30.789 --> 01:21:33.920
I'm actually
really, really sure.

01:21:36.289 --> 01:21:37.710
I gotta go guys.

01:21:37.710 --> 01:21:39.920
I love you.

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:40.619
Okay, bye.

01:22:00.710 --> 01:22:01.880
