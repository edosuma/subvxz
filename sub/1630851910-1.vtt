WEST GERMANY

00:38.680 --> 00:40.800
Welcome to Radio Free Europe.

00:41.320 --> 00:44.640
The director welcomes you.
It's an honor to meet you, General.

00:44.720 --> 00:48.200
-Thank you. Are you a fellow countrywoman?
-Yes.

00:59.120 --> 01:03.960
Moscow says that Prague
is preparing a counterrevolution,

01:04.480 --> 01:08.120
but our brothers just want socialism

01:08.840 --> 01:10.480
that is more humane,

01:11.040 --> 01:15.120
with more freedom of expression and speech
for the Czech people.

01:19.640 --> 01:24.800
In the name of freedom,
I appeal to Russian soldiers.

01:25.760 --> 01:31.720
If there is an order
to invade Czechoslovakia,

01:32.440 --> 01:34.120
do not obey.

01:34.760 --> 01:37.920
PORTUGAL
MAXUQUEIRA RECEPTION CENTER

01:38.000 --> 01:40.640
…to invade Czechoslovakia,

01:41.320 --> 01:42.800
do not obey.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.520
Don't move! Stop the car.

02:52.160 --> 02:53.120
Don't move!

02:53.200 --> 02:54.240
Where's the reel?

02:55.080 --> 02:56.280
-What reel, man?
-The reel!

02:56.360 --> 02:59.040
-What reel?
-You know. The one you're taking to RARET.

03:00.240 --> 03:01.360
The reel!

03:08.320 --> 03:09.520
Fucking take it.

04:07.960 --> 04:14.480
48 HOURS EARLIER
LISBON

05:02.120 --> 05:05.440
Now what? You pretend you don't know me?

05:06.880 --> 05:09.000
I don't know, João.
I haven't thought about it.

05:29.280 --> 05:30.480
What time is it?

05:32.040 --> 05:33.320
I have to go.

05:33.880 --> 05:34.920
Already?

06:47.160 --> 06:49.520
Don't stand around on your own, darling.

06:49.600 --> 06:52.200
You know who's asked
about you twice already?

06:52.280 --> 06:54.040
Who is Dad talking to?

06:55.800 --> 06:58.680
Jaime Ramos, the new head of PIDE.

06:58.760 --> 07:00.320
How can you not know who he is?

07:01.320 --> 07:06.320
When your dad got into power,
he got him appointed.

07:06.400 --> 07:08.840
I don't like him much.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.440
But he's… useful.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.440
And he's proven to be loyal.

07:56.080 --> 07:57.680
Are your bags packed?

07:58.440 --> 07:59.760
João?

08:00.800 --> 08:03.920
-I asked if your bags are packed.
-What bags?

08:04.000 --> 08:05.880
Aren't you leaving tomorrow?

08:06.800 --> 08:07.840
Yes, I am.

08:12.840 --> 08:14.040
Don't worry.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.920
Alcina, there's broken glass.

08:16.000 --> 08:18.560
-He's been having lessons at home.
-That's wonderful.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.240
I'm sorry, sir.

08:32.680 --> 08:34.840
Don't worry, my boy.
You might cut yourself.

08:35.800 --> 08:37.160
It's no trouble.

08:37.680 --> 08:39.840
Please, don't.

08:42.720 --> 08:45.480
I asked a friend of mine
from the conservatory

08:45.560 --> 08:47.200
to play the piano tonight.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.400
Alexandre?

08:49.840 --> 08:52.600
-Shall I play now?
-No, not yet. Please.

08:53.320 --> 08:56.840
I would like to introduce you to a friend.
Jaime Ramos.

08:57.800 --> 08:59.320
Alexandre Petrovsky.

08:59.400 --> 09:01.000
-Your last name--
-It's Russian.

09:01.080 --> 09:04.160
My family had to flee…
They had to flee the country

09:04.240 --> 09:05.960
after the communist revolution.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.080
One day, you'll be able to return.

09:08.840 --> 09:11.240
The communist regime won't last forever.

09:11.960 --> 09:14.400
It'll be over any day now…

09:49.840 --> 09:51.920
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

09:52.600 --> 09:53.560
Engineer João Vidal.

09:53.640 --> 09:56.160
I'm the new technical coordinator
for the antennas.

09:56.680 --> 09:58.240
Your ID, please?

10:13.880 --> 10:16.240
I need to search the vehicle
if you don't mind.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.960
Looks like you managed to get here, huh?

10:25.440 --> 10:26.520
How are you?

10:27.040 --> 10:28.160
I'm doing well.

10:29.080 --> 10:30.280
How are things?

10:30.360 --> 10:32.520
I haven't seen you
since we left university.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.160
-You look the same, Gonçalo.
-Liar.

10:36.840 --> 10:40.400
It's good to see you at RARET.
I hope you'll stay for some time.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.840
If they let me in.
I can see that security is tight here.

10:45.520 --> 10:46.720
Well, with good reason.

10:46.800 --> 10:50.080
We don't just play
the Eurovision Song Contest songs.

10:51.160 --> 10:53.640
Elias, are you done snooping?

10:54.160 --> 10:55.200
All good.

10:58.080 --> 10:59.440
Go right ahead, sir.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.040
Thank you. Get in.

11:17.640 --> 11:19.000
You'll like it here.

11:19.520 --> 11:22.280
The setup the Americans have
is pure luxury.

11:22.360 --> 11:23.720
What are they like?

11:23.800 --> 11:25.720
Who cares what they're like?

11:26.240 --> 11:29.400
But the American women
are quite something.

11:31.400 --> 11:32.720
And work?

11:32.800 --> 11:35.000
Nothing like
the National Broadcasting Service.

11:35.080 --> 11:38.560
-It's light-years ahead.
-Yes, I can tell from the antennas.

11:38.640 --> 11:39.480
Yeah.

11:40.160 --> 11:43.160
Each of them has a specific tilt angle
for the receiving country.

11:43.240 --> 11:46.400
But the Russians don't make our job easy.
Not at all.

11:46.480 --> 11:48.640
They're always trying
to jam our broadcasts.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.320
And do you manage to stop them?

11:52.000 --> 11:53.040
Most of the time.

11:53.120 --> 11:57.200
But it's not so bad for us
if the Commies win every now and then.

11:57.280 --> 12:00.480
As long as there's a Cold War,
our jobs are guaranteed.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.240
Don't say that too loud.
They might hear you.

12:06.600 --> 12:10.040
Every single year, we expect
RARET to be shut down, you know.

12:11.080 --> 12:13.720
Do the Americans want
to build a relay in another country?

12:13.800 --> 12:16.280
No, they wouldn't be able to. No.

12:17.000 --> 12:20.360
Portugal is at the right distance
to send the signal to the Eastern Bloc.

12:20.880 --> 12:22.880
Shortwave antennas
could only be set up here,

12:22.960 --> 12:25.240
in the middle of nowhere,
in Glória do Ribatejo.

12:25.320 --> 12:27.040
But we keep hearing them say

12:27.560 --> 12:31.320
that the Soviet Union
won't hold out much longer.

12:31.400 --> 12:34.120
But we don't know if this is true
or just part of the usual propaganda.

12:34.200 --> 12:36.040
MAY GOD ALLOW THE WORLD
TO RISE AGAIN TO LIBERTY

12:36.120 --> 12:39.000
This is the director's office.
He's waiting for us over there.

12:39.680 --> 12:42.480
War's waged with more than weapons.
That's where we come in.

12:43.000 --> 12:44.040
Amen.

12:45.040 --> 12:49.200
The whole compound
is like an American city in Ribatejo.

12:49.280 --> 12:53.840
This is where we receive the transmissions
in VHF and UHF from Lisbon.

12:53.920 --> 12:56.800
Some come in reels
from the Maxuqueira Compound,

12:56.880 --> 12:58.040
which is close by.

12:58.560 --> 13:00.560
Do the recordings come in Russian?

13:01.080 --> 13:03.640
Russian and other languages.
We don't understand a word.

13:03.720 --> 13:05.200
Everything's sent to translators

13:05.280 --> 13:07.960
to make sure
we actually have the correct recording.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.480
We also have a telegrapher

13:09.560 --> 13:13.160
who is in permanent contact with someone
on the other side of the Iron Curtain

13:13.240 --> 13:15.520
to ensure
the signal's properly transmitted.

13:16.400 --> 13:18.200
Who sends the information?

13:18.720 --> 13:22.320
Embassies, agents…
People who are on the American payroll.

13:34.480 --> 13:36.320
You'll like it.

13:40.360 --> 13:42.120
Change it. Change the frequency again.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.560
We'll change it. Wait.
We'll change the transmitter.

13:44.640 --> 13:45.480
Come on!

13:45.560 --> 13:48.080
-We'll change the frequency.
-Transmitter one is out.

13:48.160 --> 13:50.800
-Transmitter seven comes in.
-7255, changing it now.

13:50.880 --> 13:51.760
7255.

13:51.840 --> 13:55.080
Bernardino. There's still a lot
of interference in the transmission.

13:55.160 --> 13:59.360
We changed the transmitter.
Transmitter seven, frequency 7255.

13:59.440 --> 14:01.280
-Can you confirm it?
-Ramiro, what's this?

14:06.360 --> 14:08.520
Get another one ready. Where are we?

14:08.600 --> 14:10.280
We have-- One second.

14:10.360 --> 14:11.800
-Hello?
-Prepare this one.

14:11.880 --> 14:15.600
-Okay, we're transmitting.
-Great.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.040
It will be a pleasure to work with you.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.400
You're the secretary of state's son?

14:28.120 --> 14:29.920
Here, I'm just another engineer.

14:30.520 --> 14:33.080
Very well. Welcome.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.680
Bernardino, pleasure to meet you.

14:40.760 --> 14:42.720
-Hernâni.
-Glad to meet you.

14:46.480 --> 14:47.480
Ma'am.

14:47.560 --> 14:49.080
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

14:49.600 --> 14:51.360
Two coffees, please.

14:52.360 --> 14:53.320
Carolina?

14:53.880 --> 14:55.400
-Yes?
-Come here.

14:55.480 --> 14:56.680
Excuse me.

14:57.760 --> 14:59.320
-Go outside.
-Why?

14:59.400 --> 15:01.360
Just go. I'll handle this. Go on now.

15:25.840 --> 15:27.080
I'm going to Guinea.

15:47.400 --> 15:50.320
What do the villagers have to say
about the Americans being here?

15:52.160 --> 15:54.120
There's always someone
who complains, right?

15:55.960 --> 15:58.480
You know we have a lot of Reds
here in Ribatejo.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.920
It's the people who work the fields.

16:01.440 --> 16:03.200
But the CIA knows what they're doing.

16:03.720 --> 16:05.880
Most people side with the Americans.

16:19.280 --> 16:23.560
Tell me, why did you decide to leave
the National Broadcasting Service?

16:25.360 --> 16:27.000
Maybe fell out of love with Lisbon.

16:30.320 --> 16:33.880
Do you know Mia?
She's a telegrapher at RARET.

16:34.400 --> 16:35.880
Yes. What about her?

16:36.400 --> 16:39.080
I met her in Lisbon,
at a dinner with friends.

16:41.040 --> 16:42.240
I'd like to see her again.

16:42.760 --> 16:44.080
You've got good taste.

16:45.080 --> 16:47.760
You have good taste,
but you're too late. She left.

16:47.840 --> 16:51.000
-Why?
-I don't know. She quit, moved on.

16:51.960 --> 16:53.200
It's none of my business.

16:55.480 --> 16:57.000
That's good, thank you.

16:57.720 --> 16:58.920
Gentlemen.

17:00.880 --> 17:03.960
How are you?
I received some new shaving blades.

17:04.040 --> 17:06.640
-Want to take a look?
-I don't want any of that.

17:07.160 --> 17:09.880
You should. Pour me a drink.

17:13.160 --> 17:17.480
It's a shame Benfica lost
in the final against the British.

17:17.560 --> 17:20.880
But we'll get it next year!
Onward to victory!

17:22.000 --> 17:25.080
Sooner or later,
we'll conquer Europe again.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.640
I need a new blade. I left mine in Lisbon.

17:31.720 --> 17:33.280
Blades are my specialty, friend.

17:33.360 --> 17:36.880
Blades, brushes,
scissors, combs, nail clippers.

17:36.960 --> 17:40.600
If you'd like to come over to my truck,
I can show you my new collection.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.040
Excuse me.

17:47.680 --> 17:49.640
Tomé! Can I have some sauce, please?

17:54.480 --> 17:59.120
Over in the plains, a few miles past
Zé Mudo's service station, there's a shed.

18:02.640 --> 18:04.440
I was asked to give you this.

18:09.600 --> 18:10.440
Hey.

18:12.080 --> 18:13.560
Don't forget the blade.

18:55.640 --> 18:57.120
-Good afternoon.
-Good afternoon.

19:41.400 --> 19:42.440
João!

19:43.880 --> 19:44.760
João!

19:49.760 --> 19:50.840
Gonçalo.

19:50.920 --> 19:54.640
Welcoming committee.
Were you going to bed?

19:54.720 --> 19:57.160
No, I was just tidying some things up.

19:57.720 --> 20:01.960
-João, Doc. Doc, this is João.
-Miguel. Glad to meet you.

20:02.480 --> 20:06.040
No matter what ails you,
the doctor will always prescribe…

20:06.120 --> 20:07.280
-Aspirin.
-Aspirin.

20:09.160 --> 20:11.040
Are the nights always this warm here?

20:11.120 --> 20:12.160
Here?

20:12.800 --> 20:16.520
This is much hotter
than what you'd get in the Angolan jungle.

20:16.600 --> 20:20.280
The only one who's used to this is Doc,
who comes from the land of the Indians.

20:20.360 --> 20:23.080
He forgot to say there are
no Indians left in Rio de Janeiro.

20:23.160 --> 20:24.400
They killed them all.

20:24.480 --> 20:27.680
-What brings you to Portugal?
-Things are complicated in Brazil.

20:28.200 --> 20:30.760
Bombs going off all the time,
people disappearing…

20:32.240 --> 20:34.360
-Can you open this?
-Yes.

20:35.480 --> 20:38.200
Can you believe this guy's luck?
It's like he's royalty.

20:38.280 --> 20:41.360
We would only get a house like this
through marriage.

20:41.440 --> 20:42.280
Oh.

20:43.920 --> 20:45.400
-Good evening.
-Good evening.

20:45.480 --> 20:46.800
-Hi, Roberto.
-How are you?

20:46.880 --> 20:49.040
Sir, Dr. James asked
that you come by the house.

20:49.120 --> 20:51.480
-Your father called.
-I'll be there soon.

20:51.560 --> 20:53.480
Of course. Have a good evening, gentlemen.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.040
-Thank you.
-Have a good evening.

20:55.720 --> 20:57.160
Go on, go reassure your family.

20:57.240 --> 20:59.720
Okay, so we'll be at the BOQ.
Feel free to drop by.

20:59.800 --> 21:01.320
-See you soon.
-Glad to meet you.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.320
-Hello?
-Hello, Father?

21:08.840 --> 21:11.720
João, we've finally gotten ahold of you.

21:12.280 --> 21:13.640
I've only just settled in.

21:16.360 --> 21:18.560
Did you ask them to put me up in a villa?

21:18.640 --> 21:21.120
Your mother insisted that I ask them to.

21:22.520 --> 21:24.960
Please don't act on my behalf again.

21:25.040 --> 21:26.400
Suit yourself, João. Listen,

21:27.000 --> 21:30.000
stay in touch and behave like a gentleman.

21:30.080 --> 21:32.880
We hold James Wilson
in the highest regard.

21:33.600 --> 21:34.800
Goodbye.

22:27.080 --> 22:30.960
…the Soviet Union
next to the Czechoslovakian border

22:31.040 --> 22:34.240
may cause some concern,

22:34.320 --> 22:36.760
even though the Soviet Union claims

22:36.840 --> 22:39.720
they are scheduled military exercises.

22:39.800 --> 22:42.680
-Let's go.
-Come on, it's three. We have three.

22:46.520 --> 22:47.760
-How many?
-Three.

22:47.840 --> 22:49.640
-Good evening.
-Three? Five.

22:49.720 --> 22:52.800
Elias. How are you? Come grab a beer.

22:52.880 --> 22:54.520
I can't. I'm on duty.

22:54.600 --> 22:56.080
Come on, have a beer.

22:56.160 --> 22:58.920
I have a lot of respect for you,
Doctor, but rules are rules,

22:59.000 --> 23:00.920
and some people need a good night's sleep.

23:01.760 --> 23:05.160
Elias is absolutely right.
Rules are rules, guys, and…

23:05.680 --> 23:08.320
That's what I'll say to you
the next time you come to me

23:08.400 --> 23:10.360
asking for prescriptions
for family members

23:10.440 --> 23:11.960
who don't work here at RARET.

23:12.040 --> 23:14.040
Come on. You'll get me in trouble!

23:14.120 --> 23:18.400
-Give me one. No one saw.
-No.

23:18.480 --> 23:20.440
This is for when I'm off duty.

23:20.520 --> 23:22.360
Yes, it's for Portugal, Elias.

23:22.440 --> 23:24.200
-Good evening.
-Hello, João.

23:25.120 --> 23:26.000
Hello.

23:26.080 --> 23:28.840
Come on, go to bed.
Tomorrow is a working day, remember?

23:28.920 --> 23:32.840
-João. A beer?
-That was great, Doc. Really good.

23:32.920 --> 23:36.160
You told him right there.
Yes, sir, I'm proud of you.

23:36.240 --> 23:39.320
"Order is not a spontaneous product
of society."

23:39.400 --> 23:41.680
"It's the outcome
of intelligence and authority."

23:42.600 --> 23:44.560
You've got a silver tongue,
but I need gold.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.880
-Come on, three.
-I didn't come up with that.

23:46.960 --> 23:48.760
So, how many?

23:48.840 --> 23:50.880
It was Prof. Oliveira Salazar.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.360
-That makes sense.
-It makes sense.

23:56.440 --> 23:57.760
Go on, four.

24:23.440 --> 24:24.840
I don't understand.

24:26.520 --> 24:27.560
What?

24:27.640 --> 24:30.320
There are only three reasons
why you'd be doing this.

24:31.160 --> 24:34.560
And it's not money, so there are only two.

24:38.040 --> 24:39.880
Either you're being blackmailed…

24:43.360 --> 24:45.040
or it's out of conviction.

24:49.240 --> 24:50.720
Which one is it?

25:56.400 --> 25:58.640
The comrade who was with me
was taken by the police.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.680
-I just started at RARET.
-We only have one shot to get that reel.

26:02.480 --> 26:03.520
Put this on.

26:05.160 --> 26:06.080
Take this.

26:27.120 --> 26:28.080
Here.

27:09.880 --> 27:11.960
Don't move! Stop the car.

27:13.440 --> 27:14.480
Don't move!

27:14.560 --> 27:15.760
Where's the reel?

27:16.280 --> 27:17.200
The reel!

27:17.280 --> 27:19.720
-What reel, man?
-You know. The one you're taking to RARET.

27:21.480 --> 27:22.600
The reel!

28:35.280 --> 28:37.440
There was only one reel in the car.

28:37.520 --> 28:39.640
Ursula is our only solution.

28:39.720 --> 28:41.320
We're going to use her already?

28:41.920 --> 28:44.320
You only got close to her
so we could use her

28:44.400 --> 28:45.720
when the time came.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.600
She's not coming today.

28:47.680 --> 28:50.520
There are only two translators
on the job in Lisbon.

28:52.400 --> 28:53.920
I'll handle the other one.

29:08.560 --> 29:09.680
Hello?

29:09.760 --> 29:11.480
Ursula, it's Franco.

29:12.360 --> 29:13.920
Adam was in an accident.

29:14.000 --> 29:16.400
He got run over just outside his house.

29:16.480 --> 29:19.600
How is he? Is he in bad shape?

29:19.680 --> 29:21.480
His leg is broken.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.960
The problem is
there's going to be a broadcast today,

29:24.040 --> 29:26.120
and it needs to be checked urgently.

29:28.000 --> 29:28.960
I'll need to go in.

29:29.040 --> 29:32.200
You have to. Your car will arrive soon.

29:32.280 --> 29:33.440
Thank you.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.360
-Good afternoon, sir.
-Good afternoon, Guard.

29:57.880 --> 29:59.120
You know the drill.

30:04.000 --> 30:06.200
Would you mind
opening up the trunk, please?

30:20.920 --> 30:22.520
You've stepped up security.

30:31.320 --> 30:32.680
You may proceed, sir.

31:57.560 --> 32:00.240
Transmitters one and two are on.

32:00.760 --> 32:02.680
I'm still not used to this heat.

32:03.200 --> 32:04.400
It must be a big change,

32:04.480 --> 32:07.200
living in Lisbon
and then suddenly coming to Glória.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.120
I like peace and quiet.

32:09.200 --> 32:10.600
It's not always like this.

32:10.680 --> 32:13.200
You still haven't been
to an American party.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.800
Do they usually invite you?

32:14.880 --> 32:17.440
No, but I worked the last Fourth of July.

32:17.960 --> 32:19.800
They had fireworks and everything.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.680
Can I ask you a question?

32:26.960 --> 32:27.800
Sure.

32:28.520 --> 32:30.400
I was told you were in the war.

32:32.880 --> 32:35.160
Yes, in Angola. Why?

32:35.760 --> 32:38.200
What is it like? The war?

32:40.240 --> 32:43.400
Sorry for asking,
but my fiancé was just deployed to go…

32:44.840 --> 32:47.520
I'm sure he'll do everything he can
to avoid taking risks.

32:49.440 --> 32:52.480
Good afternoon, Mrs. Ursula. How are you?

32:53.400 --> 32:56.040
Getting by, as you say.

32:56.120 --> 32:57.840
Take a seat. I'll bring you your tea.

32:58.360 --> 33:01.200
I don't have time.
Can you take it to the studio?

33:01.280 --> 33:03.320
Yes, don't worry.

33:03.400 --> 33:04.680
Excuse me.

34:25.760 --> 34:26.640
Yes?

34:28.560 --> 34:29.760
Your tea.

34:41.360 --> 34:42.720
Close the door, please.

34:42.800 --> 34:43.800
Yes.

35:27.520 --> 35:32.600
Lenin, unlike all of his successors,
including the current ones,

35:33.120 --> 35:36.160
has never been a hypocrite.
He has never been--

35:38.160 --> 35:39.640
…until the development…

35:39.720 --> 35:42.880
João. You can't be here.

35:45.640 --> 35:46.600
João…

35:48.920 --> 35:50.240
Can you please leave?

35:53.280 --> 35:54.440
I need to work.

35:54.520 --> 35:55.760
I don't care.

36:26.600 --> 36:28.080
-I'm listening.
-Gonçalo.

36:46.440 --> 36:47.680
Gonçalo!

36:48.480 --> 36:50.920
-Two valves are burnt.
-Be there in a second.

36:51.000 --> 36:52.520
No, you have to come now!

36:53.040 --> 36:54.960
James asked me to pick up the reel.

36:55.040 --> 36:56.040
Who's your boss?

37:08.160 --> 37:09.240
This was the last time.

37:09.840 --> 37:11.440
But which transmitter was it?

37:11.520 --> 37:12.440
Come on, come on…

37:12.520 --> 37:14.480
I have to go to the bathroom. Quickly.

37:14.960 --> 37:16.320
-We'll leave together.
-No.

37:19.360 --> 37:20.240
I'll go first.

37:20.320 --> 37:21.520
Take the keys.

37:22.280 --> 37:23.160
Thank you.

37:43.480 --> 37:44.840
Go on, leave.

38:43.280 --> 38:47.040
BATHROOMS

38:47.120 --> 38:48.120
Gonçalo.

38:50.280 --> 38:51.360
Can I help you?

38:51.440 --> 38:53.680
I need you to open the door
and give me the reel.

38:53.760 --> 38:57.040
STUDIO 3

38:57.120 --> 39:00.240
I can take it to the broadcast room.

39:00.320 --> 39:03.320
No, don't worry. James asked me to.

39:03.400 --> 39:05.640
I was instructed to do it,
so I'll take it.

40:13.440 --> 40:14.360
Hello?

40:16.000 --> 40:17.080
One moment, please.

40:17.600 --> 40:19.360
Mr. James, it's Mr. Bill.

42:01.760 --> 42:02.840
General?

42:04.320 --> 42:06.080
Yes, it's you.

42:10.000 --> 42:13.000
The man dies. The problem dies with him.

42:38.560 --> 42:42.280
Czechoslovakia was invaded tonight
by troops from the Warsaw Pact.

42:42.360 --> 42:44.600
According to the report from Prague,

42:44.680 --> 42:47.960
the tanks that have taken to the streets
number in the thousands.

42:48.040 --> 42:49.480
Given tonight's invasion,

42:49.560 --> 42:52.640
it seems the country
will be remaining under Soviet rule,

42:52.720 --> 42:56.280
bringing an end to the Prague Spring
and socialist democratization

42:56.360 --> 42:59.640
that Dubček was advocating
against the regime in Moscow.
