00:06.876 --> 00:08.225
Mom.

00:08.269 --> 00:09.879
Mom. Psst!

00:09.922 --> 00:12.186
What is it, sweet pea?

00:12.229 --> 00:15.754
I know it's before 6:00
and I'm a'sposed to stay asleep,

00:15.798 --> 00:17.930
but could I play
with a couple toys in my room

00:17.974 --> 00:19.976
if I promise to be extra quiet?

00:22.239 --> 00:26.243
Steve, we haven't had that rule
since you were 3 years old.

00:26.287 --> 00:28.985
Yes, but I still follow it
independently.

00:29.029 --> 00:31.553
Maybe just my
Woodland Creatures Nesting set?

00:31.596 --> 00:32.728
Sure, baby.

00:32.771 --> 00:34.817
It has a mouse named Seymour.

00:34.860 --> 00:36.210
Nuh, guh-way.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.386
And there's a rabbit and an owl.

00:38.429 --> 00:40.059
- And there's a bear.
- Please, still dreaming.

00:40.083 --> 00:41.669
- Can I play with him?
- Sex with hot lady.

00:41.693 --> 00:43.497
He sounds loud and mean,
but I promise he's not.

00:43.521 --> 00:44.740
Beach.
Now she's an owl.

00:44.783 --> 00:46.394
- Oh, good.
- Why is she an owl?

00:46.437 --> 00:47.719
He's actually
-un-bear-ably cute.
-Come back, hot lady.

00:47.743 --> 00:49.136
Okay, that's that.
I'm awake!

00:49.179 --> 00:50.876
Steve, we're trying to sleep.

00:50.920 --> 00:53.923
I know, Dad, that's why
I was using my soft voice.

00:53.966 --> 00:55.403
I hate your soft voice.

00:55.446 --> 00:57.579
It reminds me
everything about you is soft.

00:57.622 --> 00:59.624
Stan, he's just a boy.

00:59.668 --> 01:01.148
He can't be as hard as you.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.324
Well, now I'm soft
because he put an owl

01:03.367 --> 01:07.763
into my dream about hot,
filthy, porno-style ssss...

01:07.806 --> 01:09.069
sandwiches!

01:09.112 --> 01:10.374
Heard dad singing.

01:10.418 --> 01:12.115
- That's my cue.
- What are you doing?

01:12.159 --> 01:14.422
Oh, I always sleep in here
when you leave.

01:14.465 --> 01:16.772
I feel like if I switch beds
once a day,

01:16.815 --> 01:18.948
I've really
accomplished something.

01:18.991 --> 01:21.690
It's a little productivity tip
I got from Garfield.

01:21.733 --> 01:23.779
Francine, are we sure
these kids are mine?

01:23.822 --> 01:25.650
100%.

01:25.694 --> 01:26.999
With Steve.

01:27.043 --> 01:30.960
And Hayley, y-y-yes.

<i>The standoff between police</i>

02:05.473 --> 02:07.475

02:16.919 --> 02:19.835
Bed Race? Sounds like something
my kids would be into.

02:21.837 --> 02:23.752

02:28.452 --> 02:29.801
Racing and winning?

02:29.845 --> 02:31.586
That sounds like something
you'd be into.

02:31.629 --> 02:33.588
It does, and if I'm into it,

02:33.631 --> 02:36.112
what's to stop me from
forcing my kids to do it?

02:36.156 --> 02:38.158
Child Services?
Ha!

02:38.201 --> 02:41.291
If they didn't take 'em away
after the "alligator incident,"

02:41.335 --> 02:43.728

they ain't never comin'

02:51.258 --> 02:52.563
I love you, let's work!

02:52.607 --> 02:56.306
- Rogu can't.
- Stay with it.

02:56.350 --> 02:59.222
We can't let anything stop us
from getting in shape.

02:59.266 --> 03:01.181
Ooh, phone!

03:01.224 --> 03:04.009
Aw, noyce,
it's a Memphis Stormfront VIP

03:04.053 --> 03:05.707
Advanced Weather Alert-gasm!

03:05.750 --> 03:07.143
Whoa, there's gonna be an early

03:07.187 --> 03:09.754
isolated snowstorm
coming to Vermont.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.147
I got to tell...
Me!

03:11.191 --> 03:12.583
Did you get the Alert-gasm?

03:12.627 --> 03:13.932
Yeah, dude.

03:13.976 --> 03:15.543
Someone's playin'
with God's balls,

03:15.586 --> 03:18.633
'cause he's spraying
white gold all over Vermont.

03:18.676 --> 03:22.114
Which means we get to do
the one thing we bond over.

03:22.158 --> 03:23.681
Skiing!

03:25.857 --> 03:29.600
<i>Buon dia,</i> my fresh,
chunky plow gobblers!

03:32.821 --> 03:35.258
Hell yeah!
We do when it comes to...

03:35.302 --> 03:37.304
Skiing!

03:37.347 --> 03:39.523
Whoa, how did you get up here?

03:39.567 --> 03:41.699
I was excited.
I jumped.

03:44.441 --> 03:46.226
I've entered us
in Langley Falls'

03:46.269 --> 03:47.836
Bed Racing Extravaganza

03:47.879 --> 03:50.708
to toughen you guys up,
teach you about hard work.

03:50.752 --> 03:51.840
Any questions?

03:51.883 --> 03:53.755
Um, is this my mattress?

03:53.798 --> 03:56.540
No, but it was almost Klaus'.

03:56.584 --> 03:58.368
I was planning to turn him
back into a human,

03:58.412 --> 03:59.587
but that'll have to wait.

03:59.630 --> 04:01.371
Oh, good,
'cause I just bought him

04:01.415 --> 04:03.286
a 50-pound bag of fish flakes,

04:03.330 --> 04:05.070
and it's the kind
he doesn't like.

04:05.114 --> 04:07.072
Okay, so let's talk design.

04:07.116 --> 04:10.337
I've secured some ultra-light
carbon fiber for the axle.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.034
And what if we decorated it

04:12.077 --> 04:14.079
with a princess bed canopy

04:14.123 --> 04:15.603
and a chiffon furbelow?

04:15.646 --> 04:17.561
- Ooh, that's nice.
- Ooh.

04:17.605 --> 04:18.693
Go back, go back.

04:18.736 --> 04:20.042
Stop it!

04:20.085 --> 04:21.365
We need to start
thinking of this

04:21.391 --> 04:23.132
as a racecar, not as a bed!

04:23.175 --> 04:24.481
Maybe someone should tell her.

04:25.961 --> 04:27.658
I can't be here right now.

04:27.702 --> 04:29.051
I'm going to work.

04:29.094 --> 04:30.420
Maybe clear my mind
in the torture...

04:30.444 --> 04:32.968
I mean, interrogation room.

04:33.011 --> 04:34.970
Has anyone seen my iPad?

04:35.013 --> 04:37.712
Is that it lying shattered
on the ground?

04:37.755 --> 04:40.541
And is that a 50-pound bag
of Beefaroni fish food

04:40.584 --> 04:42.673
that you know I don't like?

04:42.717 --> 04:44.109
You guys don't respect me!

04:44.153 --> 04:45.981
I should charge you like a bull!

04:46.024 --> 04:47.809
- Do it.
- Yeah, charge us.

04:47.852 --> 04:49.680
Haaaa!

04:49.724 --> 04:52.814
Oh, damn.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.341
What is all this?

04:58.385 --> 04:59.951
We're doing CRISPR.

04:59.995 --> 05:01.344
The children's cereal?

05:01.388 --> 05:02.476
That's Crispix.

05:02.519 --> 05:03.825
And it's not just for children.

05:03.868 --> 05:05.783
Successful scientists
like it, too.

05:05.827 --> 05:09.744
CRISPR is Clustered
Regularly Interspaced Short

05:09.787 --> 05:11.136
Palindromic Repeats.

05:11.180 --> 05:13.182
That's nerd talk for improvising

05:13.225 --> 05:17.317
a sax solo over a 2-5-1 change
on your double helix.

05:17.360 --> 05:20.581
And that was jazz talk
for we're editing DNA.

05:20.624 --> 05:21.973
Can I show him the video?!

05:22.017 --> 05:24.976
Of course you can, little buddy.

05:28.632 --> 05:32.114
<i>I'm Dr. Dubs,
and this is my ride.</i>

05:33.376 --> 05:36.074
<i>Many diseases, like those
carried by mosquitoes,</i>

05:36.118 --> 05:37.467
<i>could be eradicated by changing</i>

05:37.511 --> 05:41.776
<i>a single letter
of incorrect DNA.</i>

05:41.819 --> 05:43.865
<i>Think of genetic code
as a text document</i>

05:43.908 --> 05:45.954
<i>that describes a living thing.</i>

05:45.997 --> 05:49.653
<i>CRISPR can target the part
of the DNA causing a problem...</i>

05:51.351 --> 05:54.658
<i>...then take a mug shot
of the defective gene...</i>

05:54.702 --> 05:57.400
<i>And delivers it to
a surgical protein.</i>

05:57.444 --> 05:59.489
What the hell?!
This is my video!

05:59.533 --> 06:01.012
Not anymore.

06:01.056 --> 06:04.842
I'm friends with the editor,
and he hates you.

06:04.886 --> 06:09.499
<i>It's like putting an APB out
on a defective gene.</i>

06:09.543 --> 06:10.935
<i>And voilà!</i>

06:10.979 --> 06:13.024
<i>You've changed a living organism</i>

06:13.068 --> 06:17.725
<i>and created
a malaria-free mosquito.</i>

06:17.768 --> 06:20.423
Is this real?
Does it work on people?

06:20.467 --> 06:22.207
Sure does.
Wait.

06:22.251 --> 06:24.340
- Jackson?
- In the flesh.

06:24.384 --> 06:26.081
I always wanted to be
a wooly mammoth,

06:26.124 --> 06:27.778
and CRISPR made it happen.

06:27.822 --> 06:30.738
And these two swear this
is exactly how big they were.

06:30.781 --> 06:33.349
So it works on people, you say?

06:33.393 --> 06:35.873
And my children are people,
you say?

06:35.917 --> 06:38.485
And I can borrow this
for the weekend, you say?

06:38.528 --> 06:40.878
He's going to take it,
that's pretty clear.

06:40.922 --> 06:42.924
Let's just stand here

06:42.967 --> 06:46.710
and enjoy the smell
of giant corn and each other.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.457
You know what my favorite
kind of skis are?

06:54.501 --> 06:55.850
Brew-skis!

06:55.893 --> 06:57.460
Open wide, Lewis.

06:57.504 --> 07:01.508
Wait, no!
I'm six months sober!

07:01.551 --> 07:03.771
You're a good friend.

07:03.814 --> 07:06.600
Hey, Roger, you put those
snow chains on the tires

07:06.643 --> 07:08.515
when we pulled over
back there, right?

07:08.558 --> 07:10.081
On the tires?

07:10.125 --> 07:12.083
But if I had done that,
then I couldn't do...

07:12.127 --> 07:14.303
this!
I'm a ghooost!

07:14.346 --> 07:16.000
Ooh!

07:19.264 --> 07:21.266
Jeff, get back in your lane!

07:21.702 --> 07:23.181
Aah!

07:31.581 --> 07:32.887
We could've died.

07:32.930 --> 07:35.106
Yeah.
And then we'd all be...

07:35.150 --> 07:37.631
ghooosts!

07:37.674 --> 07:41.852
Ebenezer Scroooooge!

07:50.208 --> 07:53.429
<i>Your DNA is ready for injection.</i>

07:53.473 --> 07:55.039
<i>You may now play God.</i>

07:55.083 --> 07:57.259
Someone has to.

08:04.309 --> 08:06.790
Excuse me.
Mind if I move in?

08:14.232 --> 08:16.104
Owww.

08:16.147 --> 08:18.628
Pleased to meet you,
one-fanged Dracula.

08:18.672 --> 08:21.631
My name's
Unicorntail Softbottom.

08:27.550 --> 08:29.900
Steve, honey,
what are you doing?

08:29.944 --> 08:32.816
You may come to regret
asking me that, Francine.
Huh?

08:32.860 --> 08:36.298
I started cleaning out my closet
and spotted a few choice mags.

08:36.341 --> 08:38.256
Decided to drop trou
and fire off

08:38.300 --> 08:41.216
a few mortar rounds of Dreamy
Stevie's Thick and Creamy...

08:41.259 --> 08:42.347
Steven Anita!

08:42.391 --> 08:43.784
What is wrong with you?!

08:43.827 --> 08:47.788
Wrong?
I feel better than ever.

08:47.831 --> 08:52.314
Uh, I forgot to go
to the zoo today.

08:52.357 --> 08:55.665
Avoid Lisa's
Dry-Cleaner's at all costs.

08:55.709 --> 08:58.146
While I've never had anything
dry-cleaned here,

08:58.189 --> 09:00.975
the owner's attitude
toward potential customers

09:01.018 --> 09:03.455
needing to take a dump
in the employee bathroom

09:03.499 --> 09:06.981
shows me they more than deserve
a one-star rating.

09:07.024 --> 09:09.331
Oh, Francine, I need you
to get the paperwork going

09:09.374 --> 09:10.854
on a divorce with Jeff.

09:10.898 --> 09:13.074
Time for me to do
some big game hunting,

09:13.117 --> 09:14.554
if you catch my drift.

09:14.597 --> 09:16.425
What the...

09:20.472 --> 09:22.474
<i>Eh, nothin' to watch
on the tube.</i>

09:22.518 --> 09:25.347
<i>We could always make whoopie,
Al.</i>

09:25.390 --> 09:28.045
<i>Peggy, I'd rather bang
a bowl of beans.</i>

09:29.917 --> 09:32.876
Stan, have you noticed
that the kids are acting...

09:32.920 --> 09:34.225
strange?

09:34.269 --> 09:35.551
Probably 'cause
I altered their DNA

09:35.575 --> 09:36.619
so they're more like me.

09:36.663 --> 09:38.360
What? Why?!

09:38.403 --> 09:40.841
Look, I've tried to teach them
to hack it in this world,

09:40.884 --> 09:42.364
but I'm not getting
through to 'em.

09:42.407 --> 09:44.168
It's time I stopped
blaming myself and start...

09:44.192 --> 09:46.281
I don't remember you
blaming yourself.

09:46.324 --> 09:48.326
Exactly, 'cause that would've
been a mistake

09:48.370 --> 09:49.850
and I don't make mistakes.

09:49.893 --> 09:51.329
It's not in my DNA,

09:51.373 --> 09:53.027
and now it's not in theirs,
either.

09:53.070 --> 09:56.334
And to be honest, this town
could use a few more Stans.

09:56.378 --> 09:59.729
This town could use more
Buffalo Wild Wings locations,

09:59.773 --> 10:01.557
not this.

10:01.601 --> 10:03.646
Francine, have you ever
looked at someone

10:03.690 --> 10:06.170
and just known they needed
to get CRISPR'd?

10:06.214 --> 10:09.043
Does CRISPR have anything to do

10:09.086 --> 10:10.740
with that syringe
you're holding?

10:10.784 --> 10:12.655
No, this is liquid kisses.

10:12.699 --> 10:16.398
Liquid kisses?!
For me?

10:16.441 --> 10:18.748
<i>Screw you, Al Bundy!</i>

10:22.447 --> 10:23.666
Me too, guys.

10:23.710 --> 10:24.928
Quiet, fish!

10:24.972 --> 10:27.452
Whoa, we're really
on the same page.

10:27.496 --> 10:30.238
Burt Bacharach seems like
he should be dead by now.

10:30.281 --> 10:32.806
Whoa!

10:32.849 --> 10:34.111
Who...

10:34.155 --> 10:37.027
Great parking spot, right, guys?

10:37.071 --> 10:38.942
Hell yeah, and check
this out, pops.

10:38.986 --> 10:40.596
♪ A-ding-a-ding-a-ding

10:40.640 --> 10:42.424
♪ Bring back
those good old days ♪

10:42.467 --> 10:44.121
♪ Those, those days

10:44.165 --> 10:47.385
♪ We mean those days when
the boys sang the melody ♪

10:49.257 --> 10:53.435
Could I have engineered
a more perfect family?

10:53.478 --> 10:54.479
My chin dropped.

10:54.523 --> 10:55.829
Oh, mama.

10:55.872 --> 10:58.701
Get over here.

10:58.745 --> 11:01.443
Whoo, that is hot,
-that is hot!
-Yeah, yeah, yeah,
get her, Dad!

11:01.486 --> 11:05.186
Yes, uh, can you guys
keep it down and maybe leave?

11:05.229 --> 11:06.753
We don't open
until 5:00.

11:06.796 --> 11:09.799
Then how did we get
this pitcher of beer, Sally Mae?

11:09.843 --> 11:14.238
I think it was the steak knife
you held to Daniel's throat.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.371
Did Daniel open
his little bitch mouth?

11:16.414 --> 11:19.113
I got this.

11:19.156 --> 11:20.723
Whoa, come back here, hon.

11:20.767 --> 11:23.987
I like the initiative, but
let's all tone it down a notch.

11:24.031 --> 11:25.815
Tone down my dick, Daddy.

11:25.859 --> 11:28.775
Wow, walked right into that one.

11:32.256 --> 11:34.302
We're... alive.

11:34.345 --> 11:35.303
Oh, look.

11:35.346 --> 11:37.305
The ski resort.

11:37.348 --> 11:41.744
Oh, baby, Lewis needs soup
in a bread bowl!

11:43.354 --> 11:45.879
Shh!
You'll cause an avalanche.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.358
What are we gonna do?

11:47.402 --> 11:48.664
I brought some cherry syrup,

11:48.708 --> 11:50.710
so I'm sellin' snow cones.

11:55.366 --> 11:56.628
Ooh, I'll take one of those.

11:56.672 --> 11:57.673
Sure.

11:57.717 --> 11:59.588
$1,000.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.590
You rat.

12:09.250 --> 12:11.600
When did you guys do all this?

12:11.643 --> 12:12.993
We've been working all night.

12:13.036 --> 12:14.559
The race is this afternoon.

12:14.603 --> 12:17.998
You guys have become real
self-starters, just like me.

12:18.041 --> 12:19.129
Like you?

12:19.173 --> 12:21.610
You slept until what?
6:15?

12:21.653 --> 12:23.525
You lazy sack of eggs.

12:23.568 --> 12:24.874
Ouch.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.199
I've never been on
the business end

12:26.223 --> 12:27.964
of the sack of eggs treatment.

12:28.008 --> 12:31.576
Steve, were you gonna secure
the valves on the flamethrower

12:31.620 --> 12:34.014
or did you want it
to leak out and kill us all?

12:34.057 --> 12:37.147
Maybe I'll get on that after
I secure my fist in your mouth.

12:37.191 --> 12:39.802
Whoa! Son, that's no way
to talk to your mother.

12:39.846 --> 12:41.804
It's just a little trash talk,
Dad.

12:41.848 --> 12:43.763
You better grow a pair
before the race.

12:43.806 --> 12:45.590
Cup check!

12:45.634 --> 12:47.201
It's 6:20
in the morning.

12:47.244 --> 12:48.506
Cup check!

12:48.550 --> 12:50.770
We already knew
I didn't have one.

12:53.294 --> 12:54.599
I don't get it.

12:54.643 --> 12:56.819
My family has my DNA.

12:56.863 --> 12:58.516
They should be acting like me,

12:58.560 --> 13:02.085
but they're louder, cruder,
and more judgmental.

13:02.129 --> 13:03.802
Hey, your cup selection's
pretty picked over.

13:03.826 --> 13:05.175
You got anything in the back?

13:05.219 --> 13:07.917
Oh, yeah, we keep all
our inventory in the back

13:07.961 --> 13:09.440
so customers can't see it,

13:09.484 --> 13:12.313
and I get to field jack-off
questions like yours!

13:12.356 --> 13:14.576
- When did you get that chin?
- Oh, this morning.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.119
Kid came in here,
stuck a needle in my neck,

13:16.143 --> 13:18.188
and got everyone in his path
on the way out.

13:18.232 --> 13:20.060
Derek, are you
helping this customer?

13:20.103 --> 13:23.715
Oh, no!
They've been CRISPRing people.

13:24.934 --> 13:27.850
What did you say to me?

13:27.894 --> 13:30.853
♪ Oh, boy, it's swell to say

13:30.897 --> 13:32.072
Could be a coincidence.

13:32.115 --> 13:35.336
♪ Good morning, USA!

13:35.379 --> 13:37.294
They've CRISPR'd the whole town!

13:37.338 --> 13:39.209
I only hope I have time
to warn Chimdale.

13:45.041 --> 13:47.000
You guys CRISPR'd
the whole town!

13:47.043 --> 13:48.828
Now we got a bunch of me's
running around.

13:48.871 --> 13:50.177
You're welcome.

13:50.220 --> 13:51.831
No, something's gone wrong.

13:51.874 --> 13:54.442
Everybody out there with my DNA
is acting horribly.

13:54.485 --> 13:55.617
That's not who I am.

13:55.660 --> 13:59.534
Oh, then who are you, buttercup?

13:59.577 --> 14:01.666
Yeah, who are you, buttercup?

14:02.711 --> 14:03.886
Yeah.

14:03.930 --> 14:05.018
Knock, knock.

14:05.061 --> 14:06.106
Who are you?

14:08.108 --> 14:09.587
What are you all
even laughing at?

14:09.631 --> 14:10.850
Screw this!

14:10.893 --> 14:12.982
I need to be on an ATV
right now.

14:13.026 --> 14:15.463
We're going to the CIA
to reverse this.

14:15.506 --> 14:18.335
- But we're happy.
- And we have a Bed Race to win.

14:18.379 --> 14:20.207
Well, I'm thinking about
putting the Bed Race

14:20.250 --> 14:21.599
on the back burner
for the moment.

14:21.643 --> 14:23.471
That's loser talk, Dad,

14:23.514 --> 14:25.386
and you know
what we do to losers.

14:25.429 --> 14:27.779
Take them to lunch
and consider their ideas?

14:27.823 --> 14:30.173
Close.
Hold him down and fart on him.

14:30.217 --> 14:32.088
Yeah, that sounds closer
to what I'd do.

14:36.266 --> 14:37.702
Oh, Stan, you're awake.

14:37.746 --> 14:39.617
The family went crazy.

14:39.661 --> 14:41.924
They were farting on you
relentlessly.

14:41.968 --> 14:43.534
Klaus, untie me.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.928
Sorry, Stan,
they'll kill me if I do.

14:45.972 --> 14:47.321
I'll kill you if you don't.

14:47.364 --> 14:49.540
Ooh, but the ropes, though.

14:49.584 --> 14:51.020
But don't worry.

14:51.064 --> 14:53.849
I'll give you "Plato's Republic"
to keep you company,

14:53.893 --> 14:55.764
read by Gilbert Gottfried.

14:55.807 --> 14:58.332
<i>A man does not give what is owed</i>

14:58.375 --> 15:00.638
<i>in giving back gold</i>

15:00.682 --> 15:05.339
<i>to someone who has deposited it!</i>

15:08.385 --> 15:10.126
A-Ah-choo!

15:12.259 --> 15:15.392
God bless you, you stupid idiot.

15:15.436 --> 15:17.394
We're gonna freeze
to death here.

15:17.438 --> 15:19.222
I know we're afraid of
starting an avalanche,

15:19.266 --> 15:20.920
but we have to try something.

15:20.963 --> 15:22.138
I have an idea.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.314
If we can get out super quietly

15:24.358 --> 15:26.926
and attach our skis
to the wheels of the car,

15:26.969 --> 15:29.841
I think we could ski this whole
car down to the resort.

15:29.885 --> 15:32.279
T-That might work.

15:32.322 --> 15:33.976
We came here to ski.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.586
Let's ski.

15:46.162 --> 15:47.250
Great work.

15:47.294 --> 15:48.556
What do you say, boys?

15:48.599 --> 15:51.298
Should we head down
to the lodge?

15:51.341 --> 15:53.430
Okay, here we go.

15:53.474 --> 15:55.084
Picking up speed.

15:55.128 --> 15:56.956
Got to dodge that tree.

15:56.999 --> 15:59.610
Yeah!
Alright!

15:59.654 --> 16:02.265
100 yards.
Better slow down.

16:02.309 --> 16:04.093
Perfect stop.

16:04.137 --> 16:06.791
What?
I thought we were in the car.

16:06.835 --> 16:09.098
Damn it.
What do we do now?

16:09.142 --> 16:10.273
Plan B.

16:10.317 --> 16:11.535
Avalanche!

16:11.579 --> 16:12.797
Roger, no!

16:20.849 --> 16:22.242
Cold in here.

16:24.809 --> 16:27.029
Stan, I found
a half deck of cards.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.378
We can't play any games,

16:28.422 --> 16:30.250
but there are lots
of face cards.

16:30.293 --> 16:32.295
We could use them
to put on a play.

16:32.339 --> 16:33.470
Stan?

16:34.863 --> 16:36.256
He's gone!

16:36.299 --> 16:38.736
And he used my pocket knife
to cut the ropes.

16:38.780 --> 16:43.654
I knew he wasn't borrowing it
for "oh, no reason."

16:48.529 --> 16:49.834
They did what?!

16:49.878 --> 16:51.445
They turned the whole town.

16:51.488 --> 16:53.838
Is that why my Uber driver
punched me in the dick?

16:53.882 --> 16:55.405
- When was this?
- Like a month ago.

16:55.449 --> 16:57.059
Yeah, I think
that's a separate issue.

16:57.103 --> 16:59.061
But my family didn't turn
just like me.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.194
They turned into
terrible versions of me.

17:01.237 --> 17:02.543
That's because your personality

17:02.586 --> 17:04.849
isn't determined
purely by genetics.

17:04.893 --> 17:07.113
There's nature and nurture.

17:07.156 --> 17:08.940
I mean, you'd probably be
terrible, too,

17:08.984 --> 17:11.769
if you didn't have your kids and
your wife to balance you out.

17:11.813 --> 17:14.381
You mean my soft son
and my lazy daughter

17:14.424 --> 17:15.860
make me a better person?

17:15.904 --> 17:19.821
No, your considerate son
and your hot daughter.

17:19.864 --> 17:21.301
What can we do?

17:21.344 --> 17:23.303
Well, I think you should
let them be themselves.

17:23.346 --> 17:24.869
No, about this disaster!

17:24.913 --> 17:26.697
I guess theoretically
if we found someone

17:26.741 --> 17:29.048
with the exact opposite
DNA as you,

17:29.091 --> 17:31.137
we could neutralize your cells.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.835
Can you think of anyone
that's your exact opposite?

17:35.358 --> 17:37.882
Stan!
You're right in time.

17:37.926 --> 17:39.275
I made a bundt cake.

17:40.972 --> 17:42.626
It's a beautiful day for

17:42.670 --> 17:45.107
the 6th Annual Langley Falls
Bed Race.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.718
I'm here with last year's
runner-up, Herman Lundy.

17:47.762 --> 17:49.285
You're looking festive.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.461
I'm gonna bathe in the blood
of my enemies

17:51.505 --> 17:54.247
and bring this trophy back
to the rest of my co-workers

17:54.290 --> 17:59.556
on the janitorial staff
at Samuel Gompers Middle School!

17:59.600 --> 18:02.429
As you can see, the vibe is
a little different this year.

18:30.283 --> 18:31.458
To the inside of the turn!

18:31.501 --> 18:32.850
Go, go, go!

18:41.468 --> 18:42.686
This is awesome!

18:42.730 --> 18:44.558
I'm so glad we made it!

18:44.601 --> 18:46.037
Life is sweet!

18:46.081 --> 18:47.430
Last jump of the day.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.258
Get your sickest trick ready.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.914
Ski trip!

18:52.957 --> 18:55.395
360.

18:55.438 --> 18:58.441
Extreme.

18:59.877 --> 19:02.750
The avalanche must've buried
them somewhere around here.

19:02.793 --> 19:04.273
Wait, the dog found something.

19:04.317 --> 19:07.146
Oh, but yeah, it's lunch.

19:07.189 --> 19:08.930
Okay, try to remember this spot.

19:08.973 --> 19:10.584
They're not going anywhere.

19:15.415 --> 19:17.156
On your left!

19:36.087 --> 19:37.567
We're gonna win!

19:37.611 --> 19:40.570
And then we're gonna burn
this town to the ground!

19:43.921 --> 19:45.401
What's with all the mosquitoes?

19:46.837 --> 19:48.143
It's working.

19:48.187 --> 19:49.710
The mosquitoes are
biting everybody.

19:49.753 --> 19:52.365
What the hell's going on?

19:58.893 --> 19:59.937
Hi, Stan!

19:59.981 --> 20:01.591
Comin' in for a hug.

20:01.635 --> 20:02.679
Get away from me!

20:02.723 --> 20:04.333
Oh, man.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.119
Can I sit here?
No!

20:08.163 --> 20:10.296
- Oh, hello, Stan.
- What are you doing here?

20:10.339 --> 20:12.689
- I made a bundt cake!
- Leave me alone!

20:12.733 --> 20:15.649
- May I have this dance?
- Stop it!

20:21.132 --> 20:23.265
Slow down!
This isn't safe!

20:23.309 --> 20:24.919
Steve's a wimp again!

20:24.962 --> 20:26.225
The hell?

20:27.878 --> 20:31.795
Huh?

20:31.839 --> 20:33.362
There's my family!

20:33.406 --> 20:35.843
Each bringing your specific
kind of magic

20:35.886 --> 20:38.106
to this weird
and wonderful world.

20:38.149 --> 20:40.456
I'm sorry I changed you
to be like me.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.980
I'm not perfect,
but with your help,

20:43.024 --> 20:44.678
I am better than you,

20:44.721 --> 20:46.941
and that's something
we can all be proud of.

20:46.984 --> 20:48.812
Hey, man, can you keep it down?

20:48.856 --> 20:50.771
I'm trying to nap.

20:50.814 --> 20:52.163
Oh, of course.

20:52.207 --> 20:53.904
You're my little napper.

20:53.948 --> 20:56.255
I hope you never wake up.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.213
Bye-bye! See you soon!
