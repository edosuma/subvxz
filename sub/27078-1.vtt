01:14.975 --> 01:15.943
Hold it!

01:27.588 --> 01:28.889
This is the law, hands up!

01:29.022 --> 01:29.990
Hey!

01:42.102 --> 01:44.938
- Got ya!
- Oh God, get outta here.

01:47.908 --> 01:49.577
Grab your gold,
grab your gold!

01:49.910 --> 01:52.246
Help me, I'm dyin'.

01:52.380 --> 01:54.715
Come on, grab your gold.
You ain't havin' mine.

02:27.781 --> 02:30.184
- Where's your gold?
- Yep, I lost it.

02:30.318 --> 02:32.553
- You ain't havin' mine!
- That's fine! I'll take his.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.121
He's not gonna last much longer.

02:34.255 --> 02:35.289
Aw, crap!

02:35.589 --> 02:36.624
Shut up!

02:37.291 --> 02:38.692
- Oh!
- Oh, Jesus!

02:44.732 --> 02:47.268
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
- We gotta get better cover than this.

02:47.401 --> 02:50.471
No, look, look.

02:54.508 --> 02:58.011
Wyatt go!

03:01.649 --> 03:02.650
Whoo!

03:09.790 --> 03:11.525
Bandits, sheriff, come on!

03:12.025 --> 03:13.193
What the fuck?

03:18.198 --> 03:20.668
Who the fuck is shootin' up
my fucking town?

03:23.671 --> 03:24.938
You got the gold, boy.

03:27.541 --> 03:29.076
You got the goddamned gold.

03:29.977 --> 03:31.645
You should be fucking gone
by now.

03:43.891 --> 03:45.693
Wyatt!

03:45.826 --> 03:47.428
Don't yell his name,
you idiot!

03:52.333 --> 03:54.402
Let's go, let's go!

03:54.535 --> 03:55.936
- We gots to go, man.
- Wait.

03:56.069 --> 03:57.871
- Help with him.
- No!

03:58.205 --> 03:59.573
Do it and share his gold.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.210
- Ain't no problem with me.
- Fine, you got a deal.

04:03.777 --> 04:06.113
You drop that gold, I drop you.

04:06.414 --> 04:07.648
Come on. Grab his other arm.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.118
Grab your gold.

04:11.251 --> 04:12.520
I'm gettin' it,
I'm gettin' it!

05:40.273 --> 05:41.675
I believe these are yours.

06:15.643 --> 06:17.010
Is this your contact?

06:17.711 --> 06:19.880
Our contact seemed taller.

06:22.082 --> 06:23.083
Was he Chinese?

06:24.384 --> 06:25.686
Absolutely not.

06:28.055 --> 06:30.357
Well then, I assume
this to be Mr. Shandor.

06:32.059 --> 06:34.762
Gentlemen,
we got double-crossed.

06:53.346 --> 06:54.314
Sorry, Bob.

06:57.785 --> 06:58.786
Listen up, y'all!

07:00.588 --> 07:01.789
I'm the sheriff now.

07:03.824 --> 07:05.926
Folks, I'm goin' get me
some men together.

07:07.227 --> 07:10.130
We're gonna go after them
gold-thievin' toe rags.

07:11.899 --> 07:13.801
I'm gonna bring that situation
to a close.

07:17.404 --> 07:19.406
Now where in the blue shit
is my deputy?

07:20.474 --> 07:21.609
That'd be me, Sheriff.

07:22.876 --> 07:23.877
Right here.

07:25.412 --> 07:27.114
Well, that's quite
an advantageous

07:27.247 --> 07:29.082
defensive position
you had there, Joe.

07:30.584 --> 07:33.286
Care to enlighten us,
how all this started?

07:34.221 --> 07:36.156
The bank robbers
shot their way out of the bank,

07:36.557 --> 07:38.659
after Mr. Timms found them
rootin' around in there.

07:39.627 --> 07:41.962
He tried to be a hero
and well...

07:44.665 --> 07:45.966
I don't know about y'all,

07:47.067 --> 07:49.369
but I needs to get out there and
riddle them bitches with lead.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.506
They blasted their way
outta town, Sheriff.

07:53.273 --> 07:55.308
They shot Donegan.
I think he's dead.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.912
- You think?
- Pretty sure.

07:59.046 --> 08:00.814
His-- his head's a foot away
from his body.

08:01.414 --> 08:04.451
I've got tracking experience.
No one better than me in town.

08:06.286 --> 08:07.287
Fine.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.757
There's plenty of trees
for you to hide behind.

08:30.377 --> 08:31.879
Whoa, whoa.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.181
Hey fellas, hold up.

08:38.952 --> 08:41.221
Hey, why are we stoppin'?

08:43.657 --> 08:46.359
They'll have trackers.
We gotta split up.

08:47.628 --> 08:48.962
You're gonna slow us down,
little brother.

08:49.096 --> 08:50.063
I'll be fine.

08:50.698 --> 08:52.399
Come on, now.
We're wastin' time.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.301
And you, you gimme your share.
Come on.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.538
Take him. We split here.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.409
You head to the rendezvous.
Fix him up.

09:04.144 --> 09:06.046
I'll leave a trail
in the opposite direction,

09:06.546 --> 09:07.915
lightfoot it back to you fellas.

09:08.381 --> 09:09.983
- Casey?
- It's okay.

09:10.784 --> 09:13.153
I'll stomp about for a bit,
give 'em something to follow.

09:13.520 --> 09:14.855
I'll let this horse go off,

09:15.355 --> 09:17.090
then I'll double back
like a ghost.

09:18.025 --> 09:19.593
They don't call me
Lightfoot for nothin'.

09:20.861 --> 09:22.395
They don't call you Lightfoot.

09:22.863 --> 09:25.398
Hey. You promised me his share.

09:25.699 --> 09:26.934
Well, that's the thing,
isn't it?

09:27.801 --> 09:28.769
You dropped your share.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.774
I'm gonna hang onto my share,
and his.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.610
The way I see it,
you got some coin to earn.

09:37.510 --> 09:39.780
I'll split everything with you,
if my brother's alive

09:39.913 --> 09:41.414
when we all make it
to the rendezvous.

09:42.349 --> 09:44.184
Or I could just shoot you
right now.

09:51.191 --> 09:52.459
I isn't no mathematologist,

09:52.592 --> 09:54.461
but I also figure
your gun's bone dry.

09:57.030 --> 09:57.998
Yeah.

09:58.699 --> 10:00.801
- Interestin'.
- It is.

10:01.902 --> 10:03.671
Seein' how you's supposed
to be the hired gun,

10:03.804 --> 10:07.407
and he just got the drop on you
while digesting a lead sandwich.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.112
Don't you move.

10:13.013 --> 10:15.248
You know, maybe you're already
gettin' paid what you're worth

10:15.615 --> 10:18.085
- in getting away with nothin'.
- That's horseshit.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.288
I gunned down
half a dozen men back there.

10:22.055 --> 10:25.926
- You boys just wasn't lookin'.
- Dallas, take his gun.

10:28.796 --> 10:29.797
Hand it over.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.168
Real slow like.

10:43.877 --> 10:45.645
All right, now, you go
take those bullets out.

10:46.213 --> 10:47.647
You give him back
the empty iron.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.351
There's five bullets
in here.

10:53.721 --> 10:55.555
Well, I guess I ain't
no mathematologist, huh?

11:14.975 --> 11:16.276
You know
what I'm doin' here, Billy?

11:18.611 --> 11:20.147
I'm buyin' these bullets
off you.

11:24.117 --> 11:25.652
Pay the man
when you get to the mine.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.154
It's from my share.

11:28.055 --> 11:30.057
We'll split everything,
three ways

11:30.190 --> 11:31.391
when I get back to you guys.

11:33.160 --> 11:34.161
Billy.

11:36.830 --> 11:37.831
He dies,

11:39.699 --> 11:40.700
you die.

11:45.438 --> 11:46.539
You take it easy, brother.

11:50.643 --> 11:51.611
Let's go.

12:05.492 --> 12:08.295
Somebody go wake up Swain
and the Mugridge boys.

12:23.710 --> 12:25.412
At least they didn't damage
the safe.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.584
- Our bank has been robbed.
- Bandits.

12:33.186 --> 12:36.556
The perpetrators are on the run.
Heading towards the woods.

12:37.024 --> 12:39.059
- Degenerates.
- Harlots.

12:39.993 --> 12:40.961
Filth.

12:41.694 --> 12:44.597
I understand the sheriff
was killed too.

12:45.398 --> 12:47.634
Yes. And some good men.

12:48.936 --> 12:50.770
- Some very badly injured, sir.
- Well?

12:51.638 --> 12:52.973
What are you gonna
do about it, huh?

12:53.740 --> 12:54.741
Huh?

12:56.609 --> 12:58.411
Sheriff Noone is puttin'
a posse together, sir.

12:58.879 --> 13:01.414
Well, that's something,
I suppose.

13:01.548 --> 13:02.515
Hmm.

13:03.851 --> 13:04.818
There is a--

13:05.718 --> 13:08.021
a question about reward, sir.

13:09.722 --> 13:12.592
Well, and doing your job
is not reward enough?

13:13.460 --> 13:15.095
With a promotion there comes
a raise--

13:15.228 --> 13:17.831
I mean for the men, sirs.

13:20.633 --> 13:23.436
Very well. Twenty dollars.

13:24.471 --> 13:25.472
Dead or alive.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.878
Now, on your way, Joseph.
Time is money.

13:33.013 --> 13:34.814
And thanks
to those hamstringing harlots,

13:34.948 --> 13:36.149
we currently have neither.

13:39.319 --> 13:40.287
Harlots?

13:41.354 --> 13:42.856
I didn't say anything
about the perpetrators

13:42.990 --> 13:44.925
being women, sir.

13:45.658 --> 13:48.295
No? I'm sure I saw.

13:49.897 --> 13:51.865
They were deeply
unattractive perhaps.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.169
You're the lawman.
Now, I want this done.

13:56.769 --> 13:59.139
You tell Sheriff Noone
to get it done, you understand?

13:59.806 --> 14:01.641
- Now go.
- Go!

14:05.112 --> 14:06.113
Sir.

14:17.357 --> 14:20.060
Cor. What's all this, then?

14:20.327 --> 14:22.229
Oh, something's clearly up.
Come on, let's just--

14:22.362 --> 14:24.197
All right, love,
I'll take care of this.

14:24.497 --> 14:27.567
Oi, mate, what's occurring?
What's going on?

14:28.068 --> 14:29.569
Ban-- bandits got away.

14:29.836 --> 14:31.404
I-- I-- Into the woods.

14:32.305 --> 14:33.907
Are you mobbin' up?
You organizing a mob?

14:34.041 --> 14:35.275
You gonna go lynch some crims?

14:36.076 --> 14:38.745
- De-- dead or alive.
- Dead or alive.

14:38.878 --> 14:40.948
Oh, that makes it
so much simpler, don't it?

14:41.081 --> 14:42.582
Alive is such a ball-ache.

14:43.050 --> 14:45.018
Hey, what's the reward situation
like?

14:45.152 --> 14:47.720
Should a devastatingly
handsome gun-for-hire

14:47.854 --> 14:49.856
such as myself
partake of this posse?

14:49.990 --> 14:52.392
Mis-- Mister, these is killers
we're talkin' about.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.427
Oh, mate,
I'm from Essex.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.129
You think I've never dealt
with wrong'uns before?

14:56.396 --> 14:57.697
You think these blokes
are desperate,

14:57.830 --> 14:59.466
you should try Pitsea
when the tavern's closed.

14:59.599 --> 15:01.068
You're not from around here,
are you?

15:01.201 --> 15:02.869
No. Been here five minutes,
mate.

15:03.703 --> 15:05.538
Listen, if I were you, I--

15:05.838 --> 15:08.275
I wouldn't partake
in any of this stuff.

15:08.708 --> 15:10.877
I don't want to see
the things I seen. I--

15:11.011 --> 15:13.646
I-- I just-- I just wanna
go down to the whorehouse

15:13.780 --> 15:15.382
and die fuckin', you know?

15:16.083 --> 15:18.251
I can't deal with
all this shit, okay?

15:18.551 --> 15:19.953
Yeah, well, let me tell you
something, all right?

15:20.087 --> 15:21.921
I've been traveling
for God knows how long,

15:22.055 --> 15:23.223
through desolate nothingness,

15:23.490 --> 15:25.725
to get to this shining beacon
of frontier opportunity.

15:26.093 --> 15:27.560
I've seen nothing but dust.

15:27.694 --> 15:30.163
I've had no cuppa tea
worth a damn since Portsmouth.

15:30.463 --> 15:32.065
I haven't had a chance
to wash my face,

15:32.199 --> 15:34.567
let alone my balls,
for 48 hours.

15:34.701 --> 15:35.969
I'm itchin' like a dusty dog,

15:36.103 --> 15:38.171
and I smell
like a badger's arsehole.

15:38.438 --> 15:41.941
I've got ten, 12 hours max
before I must have a bath.

15:42.242 --> 15:43.910
And on top of that,
me wife's bleedin' knackered.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.713
And when she gets knackered,
she gets grumpy.

15:46.846 --> 15:49.016
- Oh, no, I'm-- I'm fine.
- Eh, ju, ju, buh, buh.

15:49.516 --> 15:50.483
See, see?

15:51.151 --> 15:52.986
Unplacatable, unplacatable.

15:53.120 --> 15:55.088
I just don't need any more
of her rabbit in me lugholes,

15:55.222 --> 15:57.724
- do you know what I mean?
- It's your funeral.

16:00.893 --> 16:02.162
- What a nice man.
- Yeah.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.465
- Here you go.
- Yeah. Oh, um, where you going?

16:05.932 --> 16:07.800
I can't mess up
an opportunity like this, can I?

16:08.568 --> 16:10.303
- Okay.
- It's what we came here for.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.605
Tell you what,
you go get yourself settled,

16:13.140 --> 16:14.841
have a wash. I'll see you later,

16:14.974 --> 16:16.276
and I'll be back for supper.

16:16.509 --> 16:18.245
- All right, be careful.
- Yeah, bye.

16:18.378 --> 16:19.512
- Bye, darling.
- Bye.

16:25.418 --> 16:28.321
Lot of good men
died today, not just yours.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.658
Posse'll be headin' out
soon enough.

16:33.126 --> 16:35.695
But I don't think I'll be
needin' any ladies goin'.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.631
We'll catch them
bitches soon enough.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.169
Sorry for your loss, ma'am.

16:47.874 --> 16:49.142
Saw a lot of what happened,
Sheriff.

16:49.276 --> 16:50.777
Yeah, but you did a lotta
nothin' about it.

16:50.910 --> 16:53.846
- We tried.
- I want them fucks caught.

16:54.847 --> 16:55.848
And killed.

16:56.649 --> 16:59.152
Whatever it takes
to bring this day to a close.

16:59.886 --> 17:00.887
The three men I saw,

17:01.154 --> 17:02.822
they took off
on Wilson's thoroughbreds.

17:04.191 --> 17:05.392
Well, if'n they up
into the woods,

17:05.525 --> 17:07.026
then we'll catch 'em up
soon enough.

17:08.795 --> 17:10.396
You tell the men
to shoot to kill.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.531
And dress up warm.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.701
It gets cold up in them
there hills.

17:15.635 --> 17:17.369
Do you hear anything
about a reward?

17:19.472 --> 17:20.473
Twenty dollars.

17:23.810 --> 17:24.777
Is that all you can get?

17:26.346 --> 17:28.381
Don't worry about it, Joe.
It'll be enough.

17:29.749 --> 17:31.851
Never underestimate
the desperation for money

17:31.984 --> 17:33.153
in this broke-ass town.

18:07.053 --> 18:08.121
Where are the horses?

18:12.625 --> 18:13.626
I sent 'em away.

18:18.097 --> 18:19.632
We're gonna go
in a different direction.

18:26.639 --> 18:28.475
- How far to the mine?
- Far.

18:29.442 --> 18:30.510
You weren't out long.

18:33.613 --> 18:34.781
I ain't carryin' you.

18:41.688 --> 18:43.756
Had to pick a place
way out in the woods.

18:44.724 --> 18:45.925
Nice idea, Bill.

18:48.628 --> 18:50.163
Wouldn't you rather die
out here?

18:52.899 --> 18:56.269
I think I'd rather be eaten
by crows than rot in the dark.

18:59.439 --> 19:00.440
If'n you're not there,

19:01.641 --> 19:03.810
you go home empty handed.
If I'm not there,

19:04.944 --> 19:06.012
Casey'll kill you.

19:09.882 --> 19:10.850
We'll see.

19:13.420 --> 19:14.454
We'll see.

19:16.289 --> 19:18.191
If he draws on me,
he's a dead man.

19:20.427 --> 19:23.630
You mean like that time
you drew on him,

19:24.096 --> 19:27.467
what was it, about ten,
15 minutes ago?

19:28.335 --> 19:29.736
And he sorta
just took your piece

19:29.869 --> 19:30.970
straight outta your hand?

19:32.705 --> 19:35.842
All that time
an unconscious man

19:36.309 --> 19:38.845
drew on you. Now,
who was that, again?

19:38.978 --> 19:41.981
I forget. I get all fuzzy
and fucked up.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.551
Oh, that's right, yeah.
It was me.

19:45.652 --> 19:46.653
Fuck you.

19:48.054 --> 19:51.358
Besides, you're empty, remember?

19:53.860 --> 19:55.862
That's a fair trade, compadre.

19:58.130 --> 20:00.567
That's if your brother
comes back.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.837
If I was him, I'd wander off
with all that gold

20:04.971 --> 20:06.239
rather than share it.

20:06.873 --> 20:07.874
Yeah, well...

20:09.709 --> 20:10.710
he ain't you.

20:18.084 --> 20:19.085
Come on, now.

20:20.353 --> 20:22.121
You're leavin' as big a trail
as your brother

20:22.255 --> 20:23.423
with all that blood.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.386
Aw, this is grand, this is.

20:53.853 --> 20:56.723
Proper manhunt.
This is how you spend a Sunday.

21:00.159 --> 21:01.193
Do you know
where we're headed?

21:02.695 --> 21:03.996
Yeah, I got an idea.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.073
How many guns
we facin' down there?

21:14.874 --> 21:17.777
- I saw three ride outta town.
- I saw three,

21:19.145 --> 21:20.813
but they're
tough sons-a-bitches.

21:21.147 --> 21:23.316
Cor, you ain't met
my wife properly yet.

21:23.616 --> 21:25.117
Compared to her
in one of her moods,

21:25.251 --> 21:28.287
bunch of cutthroat desperadoes
is like taking the easy way out.

21:29.556 --> 21:32.459
Oi, which one-a them two's
the most approachable?

21:35.595 --> 21:36.863
Ah, tops, what's his name?

21:38.398 --> 21:39.499
Limey Joe.

21:41.901 --> 21:45.237
Limey Joe. All right.
Thanks, boys.

21:45.605 --> 21:47.239
Reckon I might be up
for a promotion or something.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.008
You're welcome.

21:51.077 --> 21:53.946
- Limey Joe.
- Fuck off, talk to me like that.

21:54.414 --> 21:55.515
Go stand over there
with the others,

21:55.648 --> 21:57.350
- you fucking prick.
- All right.

21:57.617 --> 21:59.986
No need to let your rooster crow
before sunrise.

22:00.319 --> 22:02.455
I was just havin' a think
about this posse, right?

22:02.755 --> 22:04.090
What we need is leadership--

22:04.223 --> 22:05.892
You aren't listening to me,
are you?

22:06.526 --> 22:09.696
Fuck off, right? No, no, no.
No, you're still not listening.

22:10.296 --> 22:13.800
Fuck off. Fuck off.

22:13.933 --> 22:18.170
Go back over there and fuck off.
Once this whole thing is done,

22:18.605 --> 22:20.573
you can "un-fuck off."

22:21.140 --> 22:23.676
But until then, fuck off.

22:28.448 --> 22:30.282
Fucking fuck off.

22:40.560 --> 22:43.830
Ha-ha, yeah,
very funny, dickheads.

22:44.631 --> 22:46.799
I left England to get away
from pricks like that.

22:47.600 --> 22:48.568
And you.

24:43.082 --> 24:44.116
There it is.

24:47.620 --> 24:48.621
You all right?

24:53.159 --> 24:54.193
Goddammit.

25:00.667 --> 25:01.668
Here.

25:05.638 --> 25:06.773
No, no, no, no, no.

25:08.741 --> 25:10.442
Wake up. Hey.

25:16.549 --> 25:17.550
You're dying.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.954
You die, I do not get my gold.

25:24.624 --> 25:26.225
Or we could both die here.

25:26.959 --> 25:29.261
The crows can have
what little gold we've with us.

25:31.998 --> 25:33.399
You stink like shit.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.402
You ain't no rose garden
yourself.

25:48.848 --> 25:49.949
Yeah, you're gutshot.

25:52.118 --> 25:53.085
All right.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.724
All right what?

25:58.224 --> 26:00.559
We need to get that bullet
outta you before it poisons you.

26:00.693 --> 26:03.062
Your brother's gonna be a while.
I need to keep you alive.

26:03.930 --> 26:04.897
- Alive.
- Who'd a thought

26:05.031 --> 26:06.365
we'd be havin' so much fun, huh?

26:07.800 --> 26:09.936
You ain't comin' anywhere
near me with that blade.

26:11.738 --> 26:12.739
It's worth a shot.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.942
If you have any other ideas,

26:17.376 --> 26:18.611
you let me know, huh?

26:24.216 --> 26:26.585
First move you make
that I don't like,

26:28.054 --> 26:29.055
you're dead.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.792
Is that gonna help?

26:33.525 --> 26:36.262
Well, it couldn't hurt.
I'm sure as shit no doctor.

26:41.868 --> 26:42.835
Now,

26:43.435 --> 26:45.337
you are not gonna be likin'
what I'm gonna be doing

26:45.471 --> 26:46.572
for the next few minutes.

26:47.473 --> 26:50.609
If you're gonna be twitching,
do us a favor.

26:51.477 --> 26:53.245
Take your finger
off the trigger.

26:54.580 --> 26:56.448
I think that posse
is within earshot.

26:58.350 --> 27:01.087
Oh, and don't scream too loud.

27:59.111 --> 28:01.113
Oh, sh...

28:10.957 --> 28:12.391
Fuck!

28:14.861 --> 28:16.528
Fuck!

28:26.238 --> 28:27.740
Oh, fuck.

28:37.817 --> 28:38.785
Fuck!

28:40.920 --> 28:41.921
Dammit!

28:48.227 --> 28:49.261
Fuck it.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.673
Somethin' on your mind, deputy?

29:02.174 --> 29:04.243
It's just I've been watching
and there's--

29:05.244 --> 29:06.612
there's no sign
they came this way.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.747
No tracks, no prints, nothing.

29:09.681 --> 29:11.650
- Your point?
- Where are we going?

29:13.419 --> 29:15.754
We're gonna go find
the menstruatin' she-devils

29:15.888 --> 29:18.257
that killed our men
and robbed our bank.

29:18.925 --> 29:21.961
Again, I haven't heard anyone
say nothing

29:22.261 --> 29:24.630
about these robbers
being women, Sheriff.

29:26.765 --> 29:27.900
You laid your eyes on 'em?

29:29.335 --> 29:32.038
- They weren't women, Sheriff.
- See, I seen 'em.

29:33.105 --> 29:34.740
And I fully understand
why you might have

29:34.874 --> 29:37.009
these ladies confused for men.

29:38.144 --> 29:39.411
They got a reputation for being

29:39.545 --> 29:41.313
a particularly hideous sight
to behold.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.116
Well, I've been watching you.

29:45.952 --> 29:47.553
And you ain't looked
at a single track.

29:50.222 --> 29:51.457
You wanna head back?

29:53.659 --> 29:54.961
There ain't no barrels out here

29:55.094 --> 29:57.329
for you to hide
your fat ass behind, boy.

30:11.177 --> 30:12.178
Well, look at that.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.481
I'm feelin' uncomfortable.

30:17.049 --> 30:19.919
It's a very
incommodious sensation.

30:22.221 --> 30:23.555
Do you still got it, Joe?

30:26.859 --> 30:28.460
How's that shaking hand
of yours?

30:31.597 --> 30:32.664
That's the question, isn't it?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.502
Are your barrel-hidin' days
over?

30:57.156 --> 30:59.725
Just keep up, deputy.
I know where I'm headin'.

31:13.405 --> 31:15.407
Shh. Shh.

31:16.475 --> 31:17.443
Shh.

31:31.590 --> 31:34.493
Shh, shh.

31:45.171 --> 31:48.440
Christ, it's all your wailing.

31:50.542 --> 31:53.379
Come on!

31:53.512 --> 31:56.448
Oh, oh, oh, my God,
this is excitin', innit?

31:56.815 --> 31:59.285
Isn't this exciting?
Oh, my God, I love it.

32:04.356 --> 32:05.524
Shh, get down.

32:07.193 --> 32:09.228
Hey mate,
what's up with Chuckles?

32:09.495 --> 32:13.099
Oh, our new deputy?
He's a drunk barrel of piss.

32:15.701 --> 32:18.904
He's fast, though.
Quick with his piece. Well,

32:19.705 --> 32:21.907
- sure as hell used to be.
- What, him?

32:22.508 --> 32:24.243
Bollocks.
He don't look like much to me.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.112
Oh, I heard he took out six men.

32:26.712 --> 32:29.281
One bullet each.
Put 'em all down.

32:31.050 --> 32:32.118
Somethin' happened, though.

32:32.884 --> 32:35.287
Dunno what.
Maybe he saw too much violence.

32:36.055 --> 32:37.289
He turned yellow.

32:37.856 --> 32:39.658
Now he just keeps a low profile.

32:40.059 --> 32:42.294
Spends most of his time
a little sauced.

32:49.668 --> 32:51.003
Bloody posh wankers.

32:51.570 --> 32:53.472
Get all the breaks.
Bloody sick of this shit.

32:53.605 --> 32:54.940
We'll see what's what...

33:00.679 --> 33:02.648
There they are. Open fire!

33:13.059 --> 33:14.026
Woo!

33:22.934 --> 33:25.137
Yahoo! Yee haw!

33:54.866 --> 33:57.136
Hey, watch your head.
Get on.

33:59.371 --> 34:02.541
Oh, God.

34:03.342 --> 34:05.677
Oh, we're cornered. This is it.
I wanna go out fightin'.

34:08.647 --> 34:11.049
- Who are you assholes?
- Friends of yours?

34:15.053 --> 34:17.022
Which one of these fellas
Shandor?

34:19.525 --> 34:20.525
Not a one.

34:22.694 --> 34:23.962
Hold your fire!

34:25.397 --> 34:27.032
Yeah, why not?

34:40.679 --> 34:43.849
Let's hand 'em over.
Posse ain't here for us.

34:48.053 --> 34:49.821
Jesse Pederson
and Annie Langston!

34:51.523 --> 34:53.391
How does that guy know
we was in here?

34:54.560 --> 34:55.661
We know you're in there.

34:57.796 --> 34:58.830
Come on out!

35:00.532 --> 35:02.601
Who the fuck is Jesse Pederson
and Annie Langston?

35:05.103 --> 35:07.439
Boys, they're cornered in there.
Keep your distance.

35:08.907 --> 35:10.108
Keep an eye on them.

35:15.414 --> 35:16.415
That the law?

35:21.220 --> 35:23.989
You brought the goddamn law
with you too?

35:25.324 --> 35:26.625
Christ almighty.

35:31.062 --> 35:32.264
This doesn't make sense.

35:33.064 --> 35:35.234
I mean, sure, you girls
are probably gonna do

35:35.367 --> 35:37.603
a long dance
at the end of a short rope,

35:38.237 --> 35:39.671
but we can make it easy on you.

35:41.373 --> 35:42.408
Well, easier.

35:45.211 --> 35:47.313
You hit a bank
in the town of Bathwater.

35:47.746 --> 35:49.315
You dirty bitches gotsta pay.

35:49.648 --> 35:52.050
- You hit the bank?
- Chew on my grits.

35:56.788 --> 36:01.026
It's okay, I got this.
Fuck you, cocksmokers!

36:02.027 --> 36:03.662
- You're full of shit!
- Shh!

36:03.795 --> 36:06.832
Easy. I'm just makin'
conversation.

36:06.965 --> 36:08.600
Now they know we're here.

36:08.734 --> 36:11.303
They seemed to be aware
of that from the start!

36:13.339 --> 36:15.974
- Where's Shandor?
- Who cares?

36:16.308 --> 36:18.444
Let's just lift the gold
off these two.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.013
They haven't got any gold.

36:25.050 --> 36:27.486
You gonna pay for your crimes,
plain and simple.

36:28.119 --> 36:31.257
So come on out.
I'm a man of my word.

36:32.458 --> 36:33.425
Bollocks you are.

36:34.860 --> 36:35.861
Boys,

36:36.695 --> 36:38.730
your sheriff hasn't got a clue
who robbed the bank.

36:39.965 --> 36:42.534
We haven't done any trackin',
any hunting.

36:45.003 --> 36:46.037
We just took a stroll

36:46.338 --> 36:47.573
through the woods
and ended up here.

36:49.275 --> 36:52.210
Those girls up there,
they didn't rob the bank.

36:52.611 --> 36:55.414
Did anyone see any women?
Anyone?

36:57.683 --> 36:58.684
You?

36:59.685 --> 37:00.852
No.

37:02.488 --> 37:04.790
So, what's going on?

37:12.664 --> 37:14.366
Jesse Pederson
and Annie Langston's

37:14.500 --> 37:17.369
confidence tricksters
wanted in three territories.

37:19.004 --> 37:22.240
Confidence tricksters?
We're after fucking robbers!

37:22.841 --> 37:23.842
Killers!

37:24.676 --> 37:26.812
Them girls
was all kindsa troublemakers.

37:27.913 --> 37:31.417
They stepped up to killin'
down south. And bank robbin'.

37:39.558 --> 37:41.092
Now, this came in two weeks ago.

37:42.528 --> 37:43.729
You'd seen it your own self

37:43.862 --> 37:45.931
if you'd spend less time
in the saloon, Joe.

37:51.603 --> 37:53.439
Now, they killed
a lotta fine men.

37:55.173 --> 37:56.408
I mean, the audacity of it.

37:57.576 --> 37:58.844
Robbin' our bank.

37:59.945 --> 38:02.681
On a Sunday. Before church!

38:05.150 --> 38:07.118
You got a problem
bringin' them ladies in?

38:09.821 --> 38:11.823
Now, that reward split
between all of us,

38:11.957 --> 38:14.225
well, that's a hell of a lot
more money than 20 measly bucks.

38:18.229 --> 38:19.331
I think we're gonna get it.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.834
Belongs to you, boys. If you do.

38:25.203 --> 38:29.708
Yeah!

38:31.343 --> 38:33.044
- Cocksucker!
- Oh, why was you gettin'

38:33.178 --> 38:34.946
so worked up?
They ain't here for you.

38:35.080 --> 38:37.215
Any of those sons-a-bitches
takes a shot at me,

38:37.349 --> 38:39.551
he best not miss!
Cowardly, no-good.

38:39.685 --> 38:42.521
I mean, was it Shandor?
Is he settin' us up?

38:42.888 --> 38:44.089
Who fucked you two boys?

38:44.390 --> 38:46.658
If it was that asshole,
I'm gonna rip his heart out--

38:46.792 --> 38:49.495
- It wasn't Shandor.
- How can you be so sure?

38:49.628 --> 38:52.698
Yeah, she raises a distinctly
adequate point.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.667
Where is he, hmm?
Should've been here by now.

38:55.801 --> 38:58.570
Okay, genius.
You mind tellin' me how,

38:58.704 --> 39:00.472
whoever it is out there knows
who we are,

39:00.606 --> 39:02.307
- and--
- And how he knows we're here?

39:03.041 --> 39:05.210
Your fucking guess is as good
as mine.

39:07.312 --> 39:08.914
We killed your compadre.

39:10.115 --> 39:12.651
- Shandor, I think his name was.
- What?

39:13.519 --> 39:15.687
Mighty tall for a Chinese fella.

39:16.455 --> 39:18.724
Tall as any man that come
crossed me 'round here.

39:21.359 --> 39:22.794
He confessed it all, though.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.730
Before he took a bullet
to his skull.

39:25.296 --> 39:27.833
What? What he do that for?

39:29.300 --> 39:31.169
He's talkin'
about shootin' Wyatt.

39:31.870 --> 39:32.904
Wyatt?

39:37.543 --> 39:38.510
He was with us.

39:39.545 --> 39:42.380
But his last name sure
as shit is not Shandor.

39:42.514 --> 39:44.850
And Shandor
sure as shit ain't Chinese.

39:49.721 --> 39:53.692
You ladies are takin' the blame
for something we done.

39:55.293 --> 39:58.664
If you done it,
then where's your damn gold?

40:02.233 --> 40:03.301
Under the rainbow.

40:05.537 --> 40:06.572
Oh, wow.

40:18.216 --> 40:19.350
They ain't comin' out.

40:23.088 --> 40:25.924
I'm gonna need myself
a first man on the way in.

40:28.259 --> 40:29.928
Deputy, you keen for the job?

40:37.268 --> 40:38.269
Yeah that's what I thought.

40:41.406 --> 40:43.509
We'd have long since got
to the bottom of this

40:43.642 --> 40:45.777
if you'd have taken care
of business in town anyhow.

40:48.046 --> 40:52.651
Now, that mineshaft
is dark and narrow.

40:54.520 --> 40:56.555
They got all the eyes
and all the cover.

40:58.223 --> 40:59.891
We storm in, we could take it.

41:00.692 --> 41:02.494
But it's gonna take
a little doin'.

41:02.928 --> 41:05.296
What, a bottleneck?
Kill everyone?

41:06.097 --> 41:08.033
- Yeah, great idea.
- That's a coward's response.

41:09.968 --> 41:12.170
Well, yeah, but is--
is there another way in?

41:13.605 --> 41:14.640
There may well be.

41:18.409 --> 41:19.778
You have yourself a point there,
son.

41:23.214 --> 41:25.150
Let's have a couple men
go scoutin' around the back

41:25.283 --> 41:27.018
of them there hills,
see if there's another exit.

41:29.087 --> 41:30.321
Any volunteers?

41:35.326 --> 41:36.327
What?

41:39.197 --> 41:40.198
Where is it?

41:46.672 --> 41:49.641
- His brother took off with it.
- Man, shut up.

41:51.309 --> 41:53.812
And you led the posse here

41:54.279 --> 41:55.881
so he could get away
with it all?

41:56.915 --> 42:00.351
- Noble.
- That ain't how it is.

42:00.485 --> 42:02.520
My brother will be here,
and when he is,

42:03.288 --> 42:04.522
you won't be gettin' shit.

42:04.656 --> 42:07.693
Oh, we're gettin' somethin',
all right. Blame.

42:22.774 --> 42:25.410
All this stress,
it's makin' me sober.

42:27.713 --> 42:28.714
I don't like it.

42:30.481 --> 42:32.884
That look of concern
on your face ain't helpin' none.

42:33.685 --> 42:35.654
We're fine.
Just a hitch, that's all.

42:36.588 --> 42:37.956
We'll find another way,
make some money,

42:38.089 --> 42:39.090
then we can disappear.

42:40.258 --> 42:42.227
- For a while, at least.
- Okay.

42:43.094 --> 42:44.562
Maybe it ain't over. I mean,

42:44.930 --> 42:47.032
we can lift whatever loot
these two have comin'.

42:47.532 --> 42:50.201
No loot'll be comin'
with that posse out there.

42:52.170 --> 42:53.338
This stinks.

42:56.642 --> 42:57.909
Why'd you come here...

42:59.077 --> 43:00.211
of all places?

43:03.481 --> 43:04.883
It's our rendezvous point.

43:05.984 --> 43:06.985
Seemed out of the way.

43:07.118 --> 43:08.754
Who decided
on this place?

43:11.089 --> 43:13.124
- Casey.
- Casey who?

43:15.260 --> 43:16.261
My brother.

43:17.595 --> 43:19.798
You have any kind of feud
with your brother?

43:19.931 --> 43:22.433
Any reason for him
to send a posse after you?

43:22.768 --> 43:24.602
- He'll be here.
- He better.

43:25.671 --> 43:27.472
If'n we're takin' the heat
for your robbery,

43:27.605 --> 43:29.808
I think it only fair
we get the gold too.

43:29.941 --> 43:32.811
You'd have to take it off us,
you rotten, whoring, cu--

43:32.944 --> 43:34.713
Duck!

43:34.946 --> 43:37.415
Oh, fuck! What the fuck?

43:37.548 --> 43:38.650
Shit!

43:38.784 --> 43:41.419
Annie, for Christ sake, cool it.

43:41.987 --> 43:43.855
- Shit!
- There's a goddamn posse out there

43:43.989 --> 43:45.590
waitin' to string us up
from the tallest tree,

43:45.724 --> 43:47.258
and I wanna know some answers.

43:47.726 --> 43:50.796
Seems we're the center
of a setup.

43:51.262 --> 43:52.330
Oh, there's a setup?

43:53.131 --> 43:56.234
This is just poor timin'
and a bungled robbery,

43:56.367 --> 43:58.136
thanks to these
lunkheaded numskulls

43:58.269 --> 43:59.905
bringin' heat to our doorstep.

44:00.906 --> 44:03.508
You know, I'm startin' to think
that perhaps you ladies

44:03.641 --> 44:05.143
aren't quite the professionals
I thought.

44:05.276 --> 44:07.412
And I'm startin' to think
the best contribution

44:07.545 --> 44:09.981
you can bring
to this conversation is silence.

44:11.149 --> 44:12.117
Aw, hell.

44:12.984 --> 44:15.787
Oh, I'm-- I'm just
a businessman.

44:16.087 --> 44:17.055
What do I know?

44:17.956 --> 44:19.457
You know, it seems to me

44:19.590 --> 44:22.527
like we all is in somethin'
of a predicament.

44:24.629 --> 44:25.931
You can say that again.

44:35.673 --> 44:37.776
I thought
that we'd go out with a bang.

44:38.276 --> 44:39.978
Here and now.

44:40.812 --> 44:43.381
Jesus Christ, you been carryin'
that around this whole time?

44:45.450 --> 44:48.987
We're dead men if we go,
we're dead men if we stay.

44:49.687 --> 44:52.157
And I ain't cowering
in some cave,

44:52.457 --> 44:54.225
hostage to you bastards,

44:54.659 --> 44:57.495
or being fodder
for some hungry posse.

44:58.096 --> 45:01.299
That is the smartest thing
you've said thus far, but, uh,

45:02.834 --> 45:05.203
I'd like to explore
some other options...

45:06.271 --> 45:07.238
if you don't mind.

45:10.708 --> 45:12.510
We don't need to start
no shootouts.

45:13.411 --> 45:14.579
Or blow ourselves up.

45:14.712 --> 45:17.382
Just need to wait for Casey.
He'll get us out.

45:17.515 --> 45:18.917
Like fuck he will!

45:19.650 --> 45:22.220
Son of a bitch is so crooked
he could swallow nails

45:22.353 --> 45:24.289
and spit out corkscrews.

45:24.890 --> 45:27.258
I ain't been so sure of anythin'
in my whole life.

45:28.193 --> 45:30.495
He'll be here. He probably
just had to go

45:30.628 --> 45:32.263
the long way around
and lose the tail.

45:33.364 --> 45:35.000
Maybe, maybe he got caught.

45:35.733 --> 45:37.335
That's how they knew
you was comin' here.

45:39.170 --> 45:41.106
That sheriff has himself
a loud mouth.

45:42.841 --> 45:44.442
I can't help but think

45:44.575 --> 45:46.778
that if he caught my brother,
he'd let us know.

45:49.781 --> 45:51.416
Would you please
put that thing down?

45:57.122 --> 45:58.123
Fine.

45:59.490 --> 46:00.758
But I'm keepin' this.

46:19.410 --> 46:21.512
Fuck.

47:02.420 --> 47:04.856
Fuck! Oh!

47:19.670 --> 47:20.671
Come on.

50:04.102 --> 50:05.503
His brother fucked us.

50:09.607 --> 50:10.941
That is not your gold.

50:11.076 --> 50:13.044
You're goddamn right,
it's not my gold!

50:13.911 --> 50:17.548
Yeah, your brother just sent us
on a long walk

50:17.848 --> 50:20.951
so that we could get caught
and strung up.

50:21.819 --> 50:23.821
Which is exactly
what I would've done.

50:24.855 --> 50:27.525
You don't know him.
He ain't like you.

50:27.992 --> 50:30.195
You can keep the rest of my fee.

50:32.130 --> 50:35.233
Go on, take a look at it.
Take a look.

50:36.467 --> 50:37.435
Yeah, that's it.

50:38.803 --> 50:41.706
That's right. Lead coins.

50:44.008 --> 50:46.777
He took every last piece.

50:47.445 --> 50:50.748
He didn't even have the decency
to leave us one lousy coin.

50:52.517 --> 50:54.252
Oh, I hate to say it, friend,

50:55.153 --> 50:57.688
but I don't really see
what else could've happened.

51:04.028 --> 51:06.397
Your brother owes me
for five bullets!

51:09.900 --> 51:12.270
He wouldn't do that.
He wouldn't.

51:14.539 --> 51:16.741
People do all kindsa
strange things

51:16.874 --> 51:18.509
when money gets involved.

51:24.249 --> 51:26.484
- He wouldn't.
- I wish I could say

51:26.617 --> 51:29.454
it's the worst I've seen
blood kin do to one another,

51:30.555 --> 51:31.589
but it ain't.

51:33.057 --> 51:34.225
Not even close.

51:45.370 --> 51:49.974
Your brother is a no-good,
thieving, double-crossing snake.

51:50.775 --> 51:54.145
Now, you digest that
with what is left of your gut,

51:54.512 --> 51:58.583
and the bullet that he left
in you for me to take out.

52:11.296 --> 52:12.730
D'you reckon
we'll still get some of that

52:12.863 --> 52:13.998
thousand dollars
that sheriff promised us?

52:14.365 --> 52:16.834
I ain't doin' this for shits
and giggles. I mean, I was.

52:16.967 --> 52:18.303
Like, who don't wanna be
part of a posse?

52:18.436 --> 52:19.804
But for 1000 dollars,

52:20.238 --> 52:22.106
I could get me wife
some gingham and shut her up.

52:22.807 --> 52:25.676
So do you-- you do
this sorta thing a lot, do ya?

52:25.810 --> 52:27.011
- I've done enough.
- Oh.

52:27.912 --> 52:30.114
They call me Johnny Romford.

52:31.749 --> 52:34.519
Johnny Romford?
Who calls you that?

52:36.086 --> 52:37.054
Everyone.

52:37.922 --> 52:39.990
Oi, that sheriff's
a bit of a prick, isn't he?

52:41.326 --> 52:43.661
It's his first day.
We're on the same page now.

52:43.928 --> 52:45.663
Page? I don't read, mate.

52:45.796 --> 52:47.432
I'm more of a doer,
you know what I mean?

52:48.299 --> 52:51.202
- Have you done this before?
- Oh, I'm from Hornchurch, mate.

52:52.470 --> 52:55.873
- Well, you ever killed a man?
- See previous answer.

52:56.774 --> 52:58.776
So what's a posh bloke like you
doing in a place like this?

52:58.909 --> 53:01.312
- What makes you think I'm posh?
- You can read, can't ya?

53:03.548 --> 53:05.182
What d'you know
about the back entrance?

53:05.716 --> 53:07.985
To the mines, I mean.
What you get up to the brothel

53:08.118 --> 53:10.288
is entirely your,
uh, your business.

53:10.955 --> 53:14.225
There ain't no back entrance.
Those women weren't robbers.

53:15.760 --> 53:17.728
- And this is all bullshit.
- Oh.

53:24.835 --> 53:26.003
Isn't that a back entrance?

53:30.575 --> 53:31.609
Stand back.

53:41.352 --> 53:43.187
Don't bleed on my stuff.

53:48.559 --> 53:51.228
Oh, his blood is coagulatin'
just fine.

53:52.563 --> 53:54.932
He ain't
one-a those homo-philiacs.

53:55.466 --> 53:56.434
Even so.

53:58.303 --> 53:59.837
Looks like your friend
there is gonna last

53:59.970 --> 54:01.439
about as long
as a pint of whiskey

54:01.572 --> 54:03.040
in a five-handed poker game.

54:04.208 --> 54:05.576
I done what I could.

54:06.944 --> 54:09.079
Waste of time that was.

54:09.747 --> 54:10.881
Hey, watch it.

54:27.565 --> 54:28.766
You're mighty antsy, is all.

54:31.369 --> 54:32.670
Been travellin'
with these ladies here

54:32.803 --> 54:33.771
for a month now.

54:34.939 --> 54:37.241
It's a miracle we haven't
all shot each other yet.

54:38.709 --> 54:39.744
I don't give a fuck.

54:41.278 --> 54:42.947
I would quite like
to get my gun back,

54:43.080 --> 54:44.915
go out there,
and shoot that posse.

54:46.216 --> 54:49.787
- We's waitin' for my brother.
- Oh, here he goes again.

54:50.755 --> 54:51.756
No one's comin'.

54:52.790 --> 54:54.892
His brother ran off,
and he's mighty rich.

54:55.025 --> 54:56.794
He don't need
to go down no mine.

54:57.728 --> 54:59.129
We got separated.

55:00.197 --> 55:01.966
And what do they mine here
anyway?

55:03.133 --> 55:05.102
Gold. Yeah.

55:05.603 --> 55:07.672
Looks like they tapped it out
or somethin'.

55:08.806 --> 55:11.876
Yeah, tapped it out.

55:16.414 --> 55:17.482
You okay there?

55:19.283 --> 55:20.951
Why'd you suggest this town?

55:21.952 --> 55:23.153
Bathwater?

55:25.155 --> 55:26.791
It's a gold town.

55:28.125 --> 55:29.326
What better place
you lookin' for?

55:29.460 --> 55:32.630
Gold town with, uh,
an empty mine.

55:33.731 --> 55:35.165
Strange place to rob,

55:35.299 --> 55:37.201
is what I been thinkin'
for some time now.

55:41.506 --> 55:44.675
I'm a businessman,
not a miner.

55:45.376 --> 55:48.312
What do you want from me?
There's other mines, I'm sure.

55:49.814 --> 55:50.815
Yeah.

55:51.416 --> 55:53.217
Hey, I did my research.

55:53.684 --> 55:54.952
This town was built
on the promise

55:55.085 --> 55:56.320
of gold-rich hills, but...

55:58.188 --> 56:01.291
well, that didn't quite turn out
to be the case, now, did it?

56:02.092 --> 56:03.127
Interestin'.

56:04.361 --> 56:05.362
Right?

56:10.000 --> 56:11.602
How did you folks meet, anyway?

56:12.837 --> 56:15.172
Oh, we've been on the road
since forever.

56:15.640 --> 56:16.907
Cassidy here, he's--

56:18.008 --> 56:19.877
We met Cassidy on the road.

56:22.880 --> 56:25.182
Offered us a little somethin'
for protection,

56:25.983 --> 56:29.353
and came up with the great idea
of robbin' that bank

56:29.487 --> 56:32.056
- over there.
- Look, fascinated as I am

56:32.189 --> 56:35.025
about the specifics
of mine durability,

56:35.893 --> 56:37.962
none of this is gonna matter
if that posse comes down,

56:38.095 --> 56:39.096
shoots us all.

56:46.437 --> 56:47.438
You an outlaw?

56:52.510 --> 56:53.511
Not as a rule.

56:54.912 --> 56:56.881
Hell, what is an outlaw
nowadays?

56:58.182 --> 57:00.685
I'm no gun hand,
that's for sure.

57:02.687 --> 57:05.289
I also know
it's pretty damn hard

57:05.422 --> 57:07.958
to stay entirely
on the right side of the law

57:08.092 --> 57:10.628
- if you wanna eat.
- Yeah, ain't that the truth.

57:12.763 --> 57:16.133
- Dammit, goddammit.
- I'm just a businessman

57:16.266 --> 57:19.637
whose investment has turned
a little sour, that's all.

57:21.205 --> 57:25.142
Way I see it, I'm just as likely
to catch lead as any of you

57:25.275 --> 57:26.544
when the bullets start flyin'.

57:35.119 --> 57:36.086
Fuck this place.

57:37.121 --> 57:39.156
We'll regroup
and rob the next town over.

57:46.964 --> 57:49.433
This is Sheriff Buford J. Noone.

57:51.001 --> 57:52.036
Again.

57:53.771 --> 57:55.506
I'm gonna give y'all
till the count of three

57:55.640 --> 57:56.674
to come out.

57:58.142 --> 58:00.511
Then we're comin'
in all guns blazin'.

58:01.311 --> 58:04.114
Gimme my gun back. I'll fight.
I just need some bullets.

58:08.385 --> 58:10.454
We gonna pick
through them bodies afterwards

58:10.588 --> 58:11.789
to figure out the reward.

58:14.458 --> 58:15.960
What you ladies got to say
to that?

58:23.701 --> 58:25.369
All right, have it your way.

58:26.671 --> 58:27.705
One!

58:29.740 --> 58:30.708
Two!

58:31.609 --> 58:34.144
- Three!
- I'm a hostage!

58:36.747 --> 58:37.682
A hostage?

58:38.749 --> 58:39.717
Yeah.

58:41.518 --> 58:43.821
- In a mine?
- Yeah!

58:46.390 --> 58:49.927
- Bullshit.
- Bull true, asshole.

58:50.527 --> 58:51.528
My name--

58:52.396 --> 58:56.667
my-- my name
is Cassidy John Boucher!

59:00.605 --> 59:01.672
You a hostage?

59:02.873 --> 59:03.874
You alive?

59:05.109 --> 59:07.011
It would appear as such!

59:08.012 --> 59:10.080
What the fuck are you doin'
in there

59:10.214 --> 59:12.650
with them fugitives, Boucher?

59:14.151 --> 59:15.620
If that's who you say you is.

59:18.222 --> 59:19.690
We done have two skirts

59:19.824 --> 59:21.558
and another fella
robbed our town.

59:22.492 --> 59:24.695
I's likely to believe you's
one of 'em.

59:25.763 --> 59:27.932
- So we're comin' in!
- No, no, no!

59:28.065 --> 59:31.869
- I-- I've got information.
- What are you talkin' 'bout?

59:36.373 --> 59:38.208
Anyone in there know who you is?

59:39.376 --> 59:41.111
Well, not exactly.

59:42.613 --> 59:46.884
I'm guessin' you and I both know
you'll be in a barrel of shit

59:47.017 --> 59:49.253
if you go blowin'
me outta my boots

59:49.586 --> 59:51.956
in your clusterfuck of a raid!

59:57.594 --> 59:58.929
All right, I admit it.

01:00:00.530 --> 01:00:01.565
I'm rich...

01:00:03.734 --> 01:00:04.769
kind of.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.409
- We're goin' in!
- Fuck!

01:00:14.712 --> 01:00:18.816
Hell, they want hostages,
we got two of 'em, I reckon.

01:00:19.583 --> 01:00:22.486
- Fuck you!
- Not when I'm sober, or drunk!

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:24.188
- Dammit.
- All right, I'll go out there.

01:00:24.321 --> 01:00:25.956
You just gimme a gun
and some bullets,

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:27.191
and I'll take care of the sher--

01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:31.428
Goddammit, goddammit,
just gimme the goddamn gun.

01:00:32.529 --> 01:00:33.731
Motherfucker!

01:00:36.100 --> 01:00:37.234
You guys are mean.

01:00:42.606 --> 01:00:44.074
Hostage, my ass.

01:00:45.609 --> 01:00:46.610
Sheriff?

01:00:47.111 --> 01:00:48.779
This place has been abandoned
for years.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:51.615
Who the fuck they got in there?

01:00:52.917 --> 01:00:54.218
It's one of their gang,
that's who.

01:00:57.621 --> 01:00:58.655
So we're goin' in?

01:00:59.656 --> 01:01:02.192
Yeah. Fuck that hostage.

01:01:03.660 --> 01:01:05.763
If'n he don't get killed,
we say they shot him.

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:07.597
- You understand?
- All right.

01:01:07.732 --> 01:01:09.199
- Yeah, you got it, Sheriff.
- Yeah. All right.

01:01:10.634 --> 01:01:12.302
All right, now get y'alls ready.

01:01:13.570 --> 01:01:15.005
The only way
this is gonna go down

01:01:15.139 --> 01:01:16.874
is hard and fast.

01:01:18.709 --> 01:01:20.310
I'm gonna be right behind y'all.

01:01:22.279 --> 01:01:23.247
The plan is this.

01:01:24.214 --> 01:01:25.649
You get yourself into that cave,

01:01:26.851 --> 01:01:28.919
and if it moves,
you shoot it till it don't.

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.521
That's it.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:35.325
Get yourself into position,
and gussy up, y'all.

01:01:50.207 --> 01:01:52.242
They're comin', I know it.

01:01:53.343 --> 01:01:54.745
They ain't takin' me alive.

01:01:56.013 --> 01:01:58.248
Oh, I didn't know
you was still alive.

01:01:58.715 --> 01:02:01.051
We have to take them out.
Come on, now, gimme my gun.

01:02:01.551 --> 01:02:02.953
I'll go out there,
I'll put a bullet

01:02:03.087 --> 01:02:04.688
right in between
that sheriff's eyes,

01:02:05.389 --> 01:02:07.157
and then we'll have something
of a bond.

01:02:08.993 --> 01:02:10.194
Give the man his piece.

01:02:19.236 --> 01:02:21.305
- And Dallas' piece.
- Might as well.

01:02:24.775 --> 01:02:27.411
You won't mind exchangin'
some lead for bullets, would ya?

01:02:28.745 --> 01:02:29.746
Go on.

01:02:33.017 --> 01:02:33.984
Thank you kindly.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:39.723
I don't know, guys.

01:02:40.390 --> 01:02:43.093
We start shootin' now,
there's only one way this ends.

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:48.232
Hey, how 'bout
I step outside, hmm?

01:02:48.866 --> 01:02:50.935
- Maybe talk 'em down.
- From what I understood,

01:02:51.068 --> 01:02:52.970
you didn't wanna have nothin'
to do with the law.

01:02:53.871 --> 01:02:57.141
Well, in-- in an ideal world,
no.

01:02:57.808 --> 01:02:59.643
But needs must.

01:03:00.644 --> 01:03:01.645
Any better ideas?

01:03:07.251 --> 01:03:11.288
I'll talk to 'em here,
and you guys run.

01:03:11.721 --> 01:03:14.124
Nothin' back there
but more mine.

01:03:15.059 --> 01:03:16.460
You tryin' to get rid of us?

01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:19.096
What, it's better than gettin'
shot down here, ain't it?

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:21.899
You stand a chance then,
at least.

01:03:29.406 --> 01:03:31.175
Hey, you really think
Casey screwed us?

01:03:40.084 --> 01:03:42.519
The guy had plenty
of places to pick them off.

01:03:43.787 --> 01:03:45.856
Hell, he could put a real dent
in their numbers

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:47.191
before they even get to him.

01:03:47.824 --> 01:03:49.994
Every one of us
can walk outta here clean.

01:03:50.127 --> 01:03:52.829
We can do that much better
from in here.

01:03:53.230 --> 01:03:55.632
We'd be better off
if we were spread out a bit.

01:03:56.300 --> 01:03:59.336
Oh, think on it.
You can lead them into the dark.

01:04:00.637 --> 01:04:02.072
I could hold 'em off from here.

01:04:02.873 --> 01:04:05.042
Anyone does that,
they're dead for sure.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:07.811
Oh.

01:04:09.479 --> 01:04:10.780
May-- maybe there's a--

01:04:11.115 --> 01:04:12.849
another exit back there
or something, I--

01:04:12.983 --> 01:04:15.519
Why would you say that?

01:04:16.753 --> 01:04:19.523
I mean, there might be.

01:04:20.457 --> 01:04:21.491
What are you cookin' up?

01:04:21.959 --> 01:04:24.494
Cookin' up a crock of shit,
that's what.

01:04:33.971 --> 01:04:37.407
Why-- why don't we all
just relax, huh?

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:46.016
I'm, uh, I'm just
gonna step outside, hmm?

01:04:46.283 --> 01:04:47.851
And like I said,

01:04:48.352 --> 01:04:51.721
do the very decent thing
of buying y'all some time to--

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:54.758
Jesus!

01:04:54.891 --> 01:04:57.928
How's about you just hang out
here instead?

01:04:58.228 --> 01:04:59.263
Fuck this.

01:05:04.868 --> 01:05:06.736
I'm goin' out there
to shoot the sheriff.

01:05:07.704 --> 01:05:09.406
Just like I promised.

01:05:12.409 --> 01:05:13.743
Well, him you'll let.

01:05:14.144 --> 01:05:16.846
Go and kill them homo-philiacs!

01:05:50.547 --> 01:05:53.117
Which one of you
sons a bitches is the sheriff?

01:07:27.677 --> 01:07:28.678
Shit.

01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:38.288
Come and get me, you fuckers!

01:07:43.493 --> 01:07:45.595
You're fairly certain
your brother wouldn't stab you

01:07:45.729 --> 01:07:46.730
in the back, right?

01:07:47.364 --> 01:07:49.266
My brother's done
a lot of things.

01:07:50.867 --> 01:07:51.901
He wouldn't do that.

01:07:52.969 --> 01:07:54.171
Not to me.

01:07:55.372 --> 01:07:58.108
Suppose you stole
what you all thought was gold,

01:07:59.643 --> 01:08:02.879
but that gold had
already been stolen?

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:05.215
What on earth
are you talkin' about?

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:08.318
Maybe that bank wanted
to be robbed.

01:08:09.753 --> 01:08:11.755
Just needed
someone desperate enough

01:08:11.888 --> 01:08:14.258
to go and do the job. Fuck.

01:08:15.192 --> 01:08:16.225
Jess.

01:08:16.560 --> 01:08:18.060
You're crazy.

01:08:18.728 --> 01:08:20.197
Well, how would that even work?

01:08:20.663 --> 01:08:22.899
- For what?
- The insurance, maybe?

01:08:24.434 --> 01:08:27.069
Then why not just claim
the insurance?

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.473
Jess, you're a smart girl,

01:08:29.606 --> 01:08:31.107
but I really don't think
you're makin' much

01:08:31.241 --> 01:08:32.942
- in the way of sense.
- First of all,

01:08:33.943 --> 01:08:35.245
I ain't no girl.

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:37.680
I was married
to the sickest son of a bitch

01:08:37.814 --> 01:08:39.849
this side of Colorado.
I'm a woman.

01:08:41.151 --> 01:08:44.120
Second of all,
that sheriff up there

01:08:44.254 --> 01:08:46.990
seems pretty intent on killin'
the people robbed that bank,

01:08:47.122 --> 01:08:49.193
without a trial
I'm willin' to bet,

01:08:49.493 --> 01:08:50.993
despite his offer of a rope.

01:08:52.229 --> 01:08:54.264
Seems to think them people
is me and Annie.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:58.868
He woulda been right,
in just about an hour or so.

01:08:59.336 --> 01:09:01.104
Soon as Shandor showed up.

01:09:02.305 --> 01:09:03.439
I done told y'all.

01:09:04.573 --> 01:09:06.843
My brother
would not double-cross me.

01:09:11.481 --> 01:09:13.850
You idiots just got the bank
before we did.

01:09:23.827 --> 01:09:25.127
Who came up with this plan?

01:09:26.796 --> 01:09:27.796
We all did.

01:09:31.268 --> 01:09:32.368
Felt that way, didn't it?

01:09:37.341 --> 01:09:39.008
I shoulda listened to my gut.

01:09:40.777 --> 01:09:43.313
But I wanted to get us away
from this kinda life,

01:09:43.447 --> 01:09:45.180
and I wanted it too quick.

01:09:46.850 --> 01:09:47.917
I'm sorry, Annie.

01:09:51.688 --> 01:09:52.721
Well.

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:55.058
This has been fun, ain't it?

01:09:56.993 --> 01:09:59.162
Maybe it's time we wrap it up.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:05.669
Say, where did Shandor go?

01:10:07.304 --> 01:10:10.507
It's only Shandor
I was interested in.

01:10:11.775 --> 01:10:12.876
He's worthless.

01:10:15.379 --> 01:10:17.581
- What do you want with him?
- Someone

01:10:18.114 --> 01:10:19.816
needs to get away with the,
uh...

01:10:21.217 --> 01:10:22.218
gold.

01:10:36.232 --> 01:10:40.770
Unknown, faceless Shandor
was to have gotten away with it,

01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:42.406
in the eyes of the law.

01:10:42.839 --> 01:10:44.908
He would've made off
with the gold, the gold...

01:10:45.709 --> 01:10:46.810
the bankers woulda kept

01:10:46.943 --> 01:10:49.346
and claimed stolen
for insurance.

01:10:50.013 --> 01:10:51.147
And Cassidy here...

01:10:53.049 --> 01:10:54.484
well,
he would've killed us both...

01:10:55.719 --> 01:11:00.256
and added that 1000 buck ransom
on our heads to their quarry.

01:11:03.259 --> 01:11:06.663
He set it up for us
to hit the bank.

01:11:14.571 --> 01:11:16.440
With no gold in it.

01:11:25.715 --> 01:11:27.150
Well, it's like I said.

01:11:34.758 --> 01:11:37.293
People do all kindsa
strange things

01:11:37.427 --> 01:11:39.162
when money gets involved.

01:11:42.165 --> 01:11:43.467
Nobody move.

01:12:06.923 --> 01:12:07.857
Hmm.

01:12:26.843 --> 01:12:27.844
Interestin'.

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:22.999
Annie, Annie.

01:13:28.004 --> 01:13:30.006
Annie! Look at me.

01:14:08.277 --> 01:14:09.312
Oh, God.

01:14:18.722 --> 01:14:19.789
Come on, boys!

01:14:20.724 --> 01:14:23.159
Oh, I'm scared over here.

01:14:24.027 --> 01:14:25.595
Just waitin' for ya.

01:14:28.064 --> 01:14:31.601
I'm real lonely.
What you waitin' for?

01:14:32.468 --> 01:14:34.504
I'm ripe for pickin', boys.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.808
You yellow sons of bitches!

01:14:39.643 --> 01:14:42.812
Goddammit, goddammit,
goddammit, goddammit.

01:14:45.715 --> 01:14:46.683
Goddammit.

01:15:05.334 --> 01:15:07.370
There wasn't even any money
in that place.

01:15:08.638 --> 01:15:09.639
All we got was--

01:15:13.677 --> 01:15:14.678
Lead.

01:15:26.089 --> 01:15:27.056
You all's left?

01:15:27.957 --> 01:15:28.992
I hope not.

01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:33.863
- Who's up there?
- Just me, Sheriff!

01:15:34.363 --> 01:15:35.965
Everybody else got killed!

01:15:36.465 --> 01:15:39.636
All right. You two get yourself
in that mine,

01:15:40.604 --> 01:15:41.638
see who's left.

01:15:42.606 --> 01:15:44.340
And remember
there's a bounty to claim

01:15:45.041 --> 01:15:46.475
when you get them
bitches' heads.

01:16:00.757 --> 01:16:02.125
Get 'em. You gotta get 'em.

01:16:04.527 --> 01:16:05.528
Get 'em!

01:16:13.937 --> 01:16:15.639
You got any fight left in you?

01:17:07.724 --> 01:17:09.192
Noone says he wants the heads.

01:17:11.260 --> 01:17:12.595
Thousand bucks
between two fellas

01:17:12.729 --> 01:17:14.130
would go a long way.

01:17:36.385 --> 01:17:37.921
Sheriff! Sheriff!

01:17:38.654 --> 01:17:42.025
Oh God, it's terrible.
Sheriff, oh, my God.

01:17:42.391 --> 01:17:45.995
What a scene.
Sheriff, it's awful. Oh, my God.

01:17:46.429 --> 01:17:49.332
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

01:17:56.372 --> 01:17:58.975
Sebastian. Oh, they're dead.

01:17:59.642 --> 01:18:01.677
They're all dead.
It was a bleedin' massacre.

01:18:03.446 --> 01:18:06.682
I only got a few of 'em,
but I'm lucky to be alive.

01:18:07.050 --> 01:18:10.386
Limey Joe took a bullet.
Oh, God, they're all dead.

01:18:11.721 --> 01:18:13.522
- Everyone?
- Everyone.

01:18:13.656 --> 01:18:14.891
I'm the only one left.

01:18:15.759 --> 01:18:18.027
It's just me. It's just me.

01:18:34.343 --> 01:18:35.478
We're free!

01:18:38.114 --> 01:18:39.715
Oh, our little plan
that nobody got killed

01:18:39.849 --> 01:18:40.984
didn't work out that way.

01:18:41.484 --> 01:18:44.888
But with everyone dead,
I suppose we can rest assured

01:18:45.021 --> 01:18:47.156
that nothin' inconspicuous
is gonna get out.

01:18:48.357 --> 01:18:49.525
And to make sure of that fact,

01:18:50.026 --> 01:18:52.695
I'm gonna take that reward
that Cassidy was meant to claim,

01:18:53.296 --> 01:18:54.663
spread it out
amongst the widows.

01:18:55.464 --> 01:18:56.432
Not all of it, mind.

01:18:57.166 --> 01:18:58.634
Just enough for them
to stop diggin'.

01:18:59.602 --> 01:19:01.537
- Very good.
- Very, very good.

01:19:03.606 --> 01:19:05.574
I suppose that gold
split three ways

01:19:05.708 --> 01:19:07.310
goes a little further as well,
now, don't it?

01:19:08.277 --> 01:19:10.980
- Indeed it does, Sheriff. Yeah.
- Indeed it does.

01:19:12.048 --> 01:19:13.416
May I suggest that we drink up,

01:19:13.783 --> 01:19:16.085
head over to the jail,
pick it up, and then

01:19:16.452 --> 01:19:19.088
you fine gentlemen can fill out
all the necessary paperwork

01:19:19.222 --> 01:19:20.289
for our insurance claim?

01:19:23.259 --> 01:19:24.260
Miss Timms.

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.368
