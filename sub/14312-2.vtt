WEBVTT

00:18.273 --> 00:20.108
- On my order.
- Stop.

00:20.275 --> 00:24.821
Kravinoff, the beast is mad with fever.
It must be put down.

00:24.988 --> 00:27.449
It can be saved.

00:27.616 --> 00:29.952
We've tried tranquilizer darts.
Its hide is too--

00:30.118 --> 00:31.203
Please.

00:31.370 --> 00:33.580
Sergei Kravinoff
needs no tranquilizers...

00:33.747 --> 00:36.250
...to bring down his prey.

00:37.125 --> 00:39.294
You had better hope you're right.

01:00.315 --> 01:02.985
Oh, no, you don't, my friend.

01:09.783 --> 01:11.952
You need a nap, old man.

01:44.943 --> 01:46.862
Good boy, Gulyadkin.

01:55.579 --> 01:57.581
Sergei, my love.

01:57.748 --> 02:01.710
You were magnificent
with that poor rhinoceros.

02:01.877 --> 02:03.920
Do not patronize me, Calypso.

02:04.087 --> 02:07.049
It was, as always, all too easy.

02:07.215 --> 02:10.384
Then perhaps this
will brighten your mood.

02:10.551 --> 02:14.765
Another package from
our anonymous friend in America.

02:15.515 --> 02:17.309
This new beast is intriguing.

02:17.976 --> 02:24.274
No other creature has this combination
of speed, agility and strength.

02:24.733 --> 02:28.779
I am convinced.
It is a prey worthy of my prowess.

02:28.945 --> 02:30.739
We will fly to New York...

02:30.906 --> 02:35.952
...to hunt this Spider-Man.

04:17.762 --> 04:19.765
Hey, Parker.
Flash look about done in there?

04:19.930 --> 04:21.266
We got practise.

04:21.433 --> 04:25.520
Cool it, King Kong.
Bio's not exactly QB's top subject.

04:25.687 --> 04:28.607
Yeah, does he have a top subject?

04:28.774 --> 04:30.275
- Football.
- Football.

04:32.694 --> 04:35.655
<i>Wow, and with no spider-sense.</i>

04:35.822 --> 04:38.617
<i>Come on, Pete,
just tell her how you feel.</i>

04:39.367 --> 04:41.870
Gwen, I've been wanting to say...

04:42.037 --> 04:45.373
Hey, Rand, look. Nerd love.

04:46.374 --> 04:48.460
That I'm interning at ESU again.

04:48.627 --> 04:51.213
I heard. I'm so happy for you.

04:51.379 --> 04:53.465
I thought we could
head over together.

04:53.632 --> 04:57.052
<i>And maybe score a little
cross-town bus privacy for a real talk.</i>

04:57.219 --> 04:58.720
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

04:58.887 --> 05:00.889
I aced that final. I can feel it.

05:01.056 --> 05:03.767
And it's all because I had
the world's best tutor...

05:03.934 --> 05:05.310
...Petey.

05:07.521 --> 05:11.441
Well, I'm just glad I could help.

05:15.612 --> 05:18.406
Hey. You didn't wait for me.

05:26.748 --> 05:29.376
I wasn't sure your grateful pupil
would detach herself...

05:29.543 --> 05:31.211
...in time for you to catch the bus.

05:31.378 --> 05:32.754
There he is.

05:32.921 --> 05:35.006
- Welcome back, Pete.
- Thanks.

05:35.173 --> 05:37.259
And thanks for the second chance.

05:37.425 --> 05:40.595
- I promise I won't need a third.
- We hope not, Peter.

05:40.762 --> 05:43.723
Pete, this is Debra Whitman.
She's the new Eddie.

05:43.890 --> 05:46.935
Hey, Deb.
It's nice to be working with you.

05:47.102 --> 05:49.354
I think she prefers Debra.

05:49.521 --> 05:52.440
Speaking of Eddie,
I know you two are friends.

05:52.607 --> 05:55.235
- Have you heard from him?
- Yeah, I'm worried.

05:55.402 --> 05:57.779
He was right behind me
at the Thanksgiving Parade...

05:57.946 --> 05:59.281
...when that monster--

05:59.447 --> 06:02.909
Anyway, I haven't seen him since.
Do you think--?

06:03.076 --> 06:05.787
Sorry. I don't know where he is.

06:05.954 --> 06:07.873
Believe me, I wish I did.

06:08.039 --> 06:11.209
Curt, this research of yours
is stunning.

06:11.376 --> 06:14.963
Kids, this is our new senior fellow,
Dr. Miles Warren.

06:15.130 --> 06:17.299
- Miles, this--
- Yes, Gwen Stacy, Peter Parker.

06:17.465 --> 06:20.343
My brother, your biology professor,
speaks highly of you both.

06:20.510 --> 06:21.803
Now, about your theories...

06:21.970 --> 06:24.973
...on lizard DNA's mutagenic
application to the human genome.

06:25.140 --> 06:26.808
They mesh perfectly with my work...

06:26.975 --> 06:29.311
...running computer simulations
on mammalian DNA.

06:29.477 --> 06:30.812
Missing a step, of course.

06:30.979 --> 06:33.607
The formula must be electrolyzed
to increase potency.

06:33.773 --> 06:35.275
But if we combine our efforts...

06:35.442 --> 06:37.736
...we could have a working,
programmable mutagen--

06:37.903 --> 06:40.488
That line of research
was a dead end, Miles.

06:40.655 --> 06:44.492
Something of an embarrassment,
really. Please, just drop it.

06:46.119 --> 06:48.204
If you insist.

06:52.125 --> 06:56.671
<i>I think Liz Allan really is into me.</i>

06:56.838 --> 06:58.131
<i>Gwen too.</i>

06:59.507 --> 07:01.843
<i>Gwen, Liz. Liz, Gwen.</i>

07:02.010 --> 07:05.972
<i>Web-slinging 30 floors up
never made me this dizzy.</i>

07:06.681 --> 07:08.516
There you are.

07:08.683 --> 07:11.853
Such agility, such grace.

07:12.020 --> 07:16.024
Truly, prey worthy of Sergei Kravinoff.

07:54.896 --> 07:56.064
Where'd you come from?

07:56.231 --> 07:59.734
Mother Russia,
by way of mother Africa.

07:59.901 --> 08:02.570
Two moms and still so ill-behaved?

08:15.083 --> 08:16.751
Look, what's the game here?

08:18.003 --> 08:20.505
Big game. Now be still.

08:20.672 --> 08:25.260
The noblest prey ends the hunt
in silent dignity.

08:25.427 --> 08:27.095
Prey? Silent?

08:27.262 --> 08:29.347
Dignity? You don't know me at all.

08:33.559 --> 08:36.604
You cannot shake Sergei Kravinoff
so easily.

08:36.770 --> 08:38.940
Hey, Spidey never does
anything easy.

08:39.107 --> 08:41.650
Oh, man, now you've got me talking
in the third person.

08:41.818 --> 08:43.361
Just for that...

08:46.614 --> 08:48.199
Amazing.

08:48.366 --> 08:51.619
No beast has ever broken
the grip of Kravinoff.

08:51.786 --> 08:54.039
Oh, okay,
I think I see the confusion.

08:54.205 --> 08:57.876
Not a beast, a spider man, get it?

09:01.588 --> 09:05.633
Always Kravinoff tempers his skills
to give his quarry a chance.

09:05.800 --> 09:09.054
At last, Kravinoff can be Kravinoff...

09:09.220 --> 09:11.598
...and thrill to a true challenge.

09:12.515 --> 09:13.558
Missed.

09:13.725 --> 09:15.643
And missed again.

09:19.439 --> 09:21.649
Okay, point for you.

09:21.816 --> 09:23.818
But proportionate strength
of a spider here.

09:23.985 --> 09:26.112
<i>- I'll</i> snap this thing and--
- Don't bother.

09:26.279 --> 09:29.783
This blow dart is tipped
with a paralyzing poison.

09:29.949 --> 09:33.787
It will all be over soon.

09:40.794 --> 09:41.836
What is this?

09:42.003 --> 09:45.090
Just a little sample of my spectacular
spider powers, chief.

09:45.256 --> 09:46.800
Here's another.

10:09.197 --> 10:11.616
Okay, the thermals with the hearts
were half-price...

10:11.783 --> 10:14.494
...and do not reflect
my very high macho quotient.

10:33.054 --> 10:35.390
You just don't get it.

10:37.725 --> 10:40.520
You're good. Maybe at hunting,
you're even the best.

10:40.687 --> 10:43.857
But when it comes to the New York
super-powered scene...

10:44.023 --> 10:45.859
...you're out of your league.

10:48.570 --> 10:49.612
No.

10:49.779 --> 10:53.074
This cannot be happening
to Sergei Kravinoff.

10:53.241 --> 10:54.576
Oh, Kravin off.

10:55.368 --> 10:57.495
Look at that guy.

11:08.214 --> 11:10.717
You have need of me, love?

11:13.595 --> 11:14.929
I did not call you.

11:15.096 --> 11:18.099
And yet I am here.

11:18.600 --> 11:19.767
No, Calypso.

11:19.934 --> 11:23.104
Only the hunt may restore
my lost honour.

11:23.271 --> 11:24.939
Gulyadkin.

11:59.307 --> 12:01.017
Formula electrolyzed.

12:01.184 --> 12:05.563
Point 02 volts for three seconds.

12:06.898 --> 12:08.483
Increased cell division.

12:09.025 --> 12:11.236
I'm as close to adapting
Dr. Connors' mutagen...

12:11.402 --> 12:13.863
...to mammalian DNA
as I can come...

12:14.030 --> 12:16.574
...without a test subject.

12:26.334 --> 12:27.669
He has been here.

12:28.044 --> 12:29.504
What is this place?

12:29.671 --> 12:31.589
My laboratory.

12:31.756 --> 12:34.259
What a magnificent specimen.

12:34.842 --> 12:35.927
Yours, I presume?

12:36.094 --> 12:38.846
Gulyadkin is no man's property.

12:39.013 --> 12:43.101
These spiders,
they do not exist in the natural world.

12:43.268 --> 12:46.813
Genetically altered to combine traits
from multiple species.

12:46.980 --> 12:49.274
- You can do that?
- I can.

12:49.440 --> 12:51.609
Then you created the Spider-Man.

12:52.694 --> 12:56.489
Yes, I gave Spider-Man his powers.

12:56.656 --> 13:00.368
Powers, yes.
That is how he beat me.

13:00.535 --> 13:04.455
The only reason he beat me.
Give me powers.

13:04.622 --> 13:07.292
Spider-Man paid handsomely
for his.

13:10.211 --> 13:14.549
Why should I pay
for what I can take?

13:14.716 --> 13:17.093
You'll have no idea
what I'm doing to you.

13:17.260 --> 13:18.553
Would you really trust me...

13:18.720 --> 13:22.640
...if it weren't in my self-interest
to succeed?

13:24.851 --> 13:28.396
<i>Winding down the fourth quarter
of the state championship...</i>

13:28.563 --> 13:31.566
<i>...Mustangs are down by five
as Woodoak runs out the clock.</i>

13:32.025 --> 13:35.945
<i>Say, hey, what do you say
Midtown will come back today</i>

13:36.112 --> 13:39.907
<i>Go, Mustangs! Defence!</i>

13:41.034 --> 13:43.494
<i>Man, I love spectator sports.</i>

13:43.661 --> 13:45.997
Hey, Petey. Is that the new camera?

13:46.164 --> 13:49.917
Yep, paid for with the advance
from my exclusive deal with the Bugle.

13:50.084 --> 13:53.588
Peter. Did I hear you say
you're taking pictures for the Bugle?

13:57.216 --> 13:59.761
Liz, you can't want to be
in the paper that badly.

13:59.927 --> 14:01.763
Geekitude is contagious.

14:02.430 --> 14:04.599
I don't mind catching
what Petey's got.

14:07.393 --> 14:10.229
<i>Gorillas fumble!</i>

14:12.190 --> 14:14.025
<i>King Kong recovers.</i>

14:14.192 --> 14:17.195
<i>Midtown's ball with 30 seconds
on the clock.</i>

14:21.657 --> 14:23.618
<i>Thompson to Robertson.</i>

14:26.996 --> 14:29.457
<i>Out of bounds at the 50, 12 seconds.</i>

14:29.624 --> 14:31.292
<i>Rand, Rand, he's our man</i>

14:31.459 --> 14:33.252
<i>Rand, Rand, he's my man</i>

14:33.419 --> 14:35.463
Gold ninety. Gold ninety.

14:35.630 --> 14:36.756
Hut-hut.

14:36.923 --> 14:40.301
Come on, Flash, you can do it.
Can't believe I just said that.

14:43.888 --> 14:46.182
<i>Flash Thompson
unleashes the bomb.</i>

14:46.349 --> 14:49.602
<i>And Brown catches it!
The Mustangs win state!</i>

14:49.769 --> 14:51.938
<i>The Mustangs win state!</i>

14:52.105 --> 14:54.148
<i>Wait. Thompson's down.</i>

14:54.315 --> 14:55.983
Flash?

14:56.609 --> 14:58.486
Flash.

15:00.696 --> 15:03.699
Here's the last
of your down payment, doctor.

15:03.866 --> 15:06.744
The rest comes
when I get what I need.

15:06.911 --> 15:12.333
And if I don't,
Gulyadkin makes the final payment.

15:14.127 --> 15:16.170
There's no need for melodrama.

15:20.675 --> 15:24.095
The mutagen was compounded
to your specifications.

15:24.262 --> 15:26.431
One more jolt...

15:33.187 --> 15:36.357
...and you're a new man.

15:41.320 --> 15:43.156
I feel nothing.

15:43.781 --> 15:46.993
Days of treatments and still nothing.

15:47.160 --> 15:50.496
You dare try to fool Kravinoff?
Admit it.

15:50.663 --> 15:54.625
You are in league with Spider-Man.
His scent is all over this lab.

15:54.792 --> 15:56.377
You can smell him?

16:20.067 --> 16:22.737
I believe I'm owed
an apology, Kravinoff.

16:22.904 --> 16:24.489
Call me Kraven.

16:24.906 --> 16:27.950
Kraven the Hunter.

16:32.413 --> 16:35.875
<i>It's not like I want bad things
to happen to Flash.</i>

16:36.042 --> 16:38.085
<i>Well, not super bad things.</i>

16:38.252 --> 16:41.380
<i>Well, at least not super bad things
that make Liz forget I exist.</i>

16:42.715 --> 16:45.676
<i>And why stress over Liz anyway?
I'm into Gwen.</i>

16:46.677 --> 16:48.179
<i>Right?</i>

16:54.602 --> 16:55.728
Hey, I know that getup.

16:56.103 --> 16:58.272
Kravinoff, is that you?.

17:01.275 --> 17:03.611
You can call me Kraven now.

17:04.862 --> 17:07.615
I could call you a lot of things.
What happened to you?

17:07.781 --> 17:09.617
Same as happened to you.

17:09.784 --> 17:12.954
Except Kraven pay
for higher class of DNA.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.957
- You paid to do that to yourself?
- Of course.

17:16.123 --> 17:19.126
Now Kraven climb
and leap like leopard...

17:19.292 --> 17:21.127
...run fast as cheetah...

17:21.295 --> 17:23.964
...and possess strength of lion.

17:33.641 --> 17:34.767
Don't get any ideas.

17:34.934 --> 17:38.437
Before, your powers
gave advantage.

17:38.604 --> 17:44.902
But Kraven has levelled the field,
and you will fall like any prey.

17:45.069 --> 17:46.529
Hate to break it to you, tabby.

17:46.696 --> 17:49.073
You're not my first genetic experiment
gone wrong.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.826
Just the first that smells
like a litter box.

17:51.993 --> 17:54.328
All I smell is fear.

18:10.469 --> 18:11.554
Perfect.

18:11.721 --> 18:13.347
Hang on. Gotta take this.

18:13.514 --> 18:15.975
<i>- Liz?
- Oh, Petey, thank goodness.</i>

18:16.142 --> 18:18.060
Flash is in surgery,
and I'm freaking out.

18:18.227 --> 18:20.813
Can you come
to Manhattan General?

18:21.522 --> 18:23.024
I'm in the middle of something.

18:23.190 --> 18:26.152
Please, Petey. I really need you.

18:26.319 --> 18:27.987
You do? Okay.

18:28.154 --> 18:30.364
Soon as I can, I promise.

18:31.699 --> 18:32.742
Thanks, Petey.

18:32.908 --> 18:35.161
Oh, Flash's parents are here.
Gotta go, bye.

18:35.620 --> 18:38.372
Yeah, she's gotta go.

18:40.291 --> 18:43.544
<i>That's it. I've had enough of gorillas
for one night.</i>

18:43.711 --> 18:45.921
<i>This one's for Flash.</i>

18:46.714 --> 18:48.883
<i>Can't believe I just thought that.</i>

19:12.740 --> 19:14.742
Here, kitty, kitty.

19:14.909 --> 19:17.119
<i>Wish I was playing hide and seek
with Black Cat.</i>

19:17.286 --> 19:19.038
<i>I so prefer my felines female.</i>

19:47.108 --> 19:49.443
Yeah, the werewolf look was passé.

19:49.610 --> 19:52.738
But the mummy thing, pure gold.

20:24.395 --> 20:27.106
Now you're mine, prey.

20:27.273 --> 20:29.442
Sorry, who's the prey?

20:34.280 --> 20:35.865
Take that, pussycat.

20:36.031 --> 20:38.659
A lesson in humility,
courtesy of the original...

20:38.826 --> 20:42.204
...and still number one
genetic misfit, me.

20:59.096 --> 21:00.306
Liz.

21:01.474 --> 21:02.850
Petey.

21:03.017 --> 21:04.518
Are you okay?

21:04.685 --> 21:05.853
I'm fine.

21:06.020 --> 21:08.189
But Flash is still in surgery.

21:08.355 --> 21:13.110
I know you two aren't exactly close,
but if you'd just sit with me...

21:13.277 --> 21:15.821
Sure, as long as it takes.

21:15.988 --> 21:17.406
Thanks.

21:17.573 --> 21:19.867
I'm so glad you--

21:20.034 --> 21:21.202
Well, he did great.

21:21.368 --> 21:22.995
There's every reason to be hopeful.

21:23.162 --> 21:25.539
But we won't know how the knee
will heal for months.

21:25.706 --> 21:26.957
He'll wake soon.

21:27.124 --> 21:29.126
Immediate family only.

21:34.215 --> 21:35.883
Calypso?

21:36.050 --> 21:38.886
This change, it--

21:39.512 --> 21:41.847
The eyes suit you, love.

21:42.598 --> 21:45.893
The hunt is not over.

21:46.060 --> 21:47.728
<i>Glad to hear it.</i>

21:47.895 --> 21:52.691
Our anonymous American friend
now has a name of sorts.

21:52.858 --> 21:54.860
<i>I'm called the Master Planner.</i>

21:55.027 --> 21:56.862
<i>And I was wondering...</i>

21:57.029 --> 22:02.034
<i>...how do you feel
about hunting in packs?</i>
