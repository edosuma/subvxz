WEBVTT

00:01.566 --> 00:03.264
Previously onSWAT...I got an emergency.

00:03.307 --> 00:05.048
Hell you do. What am I
supposed to tell Hondo?

00:05.092 --> 00:06.832
Hondo, listen, I got to make
a quick detour.

00:06.876 --> 00:08.486
I didn't mean
to ruin your day at work.

00:08.530 --> 00:10.706
I know how important
work is for you.

00:10.749 --> 00:14.014
Where the hell is he, Chris?I think there's some kind
of drama going on with his mom.

00:14.057 --> 00:15.319
STREET:
You probably already know,

00:15.363 --> 00:17.147
but I lied.You're off SWAT.

00:17.191 --> 00:19.149
You report
to patrol duty tomorrow.

00:19.193 --> 00:20.324
Hondo, this is not
how this ends.

00:20.368 --> 00:22.674
You don't kick people
out of a family!

00:22.718 --> 00:24.415
You want to stop being a cop,
you keep pushing it.

00:24.459 --> 00:27.766
I don't need you
or anybody else.

00:28.376 --> 00:29.594
[engines revving]

00:42.433 --> 00:45.349
MAN: Let's go, baby!MAN 2: There it is!

00:45.393 --> 00:47.917
MAN:
Yeah, come on!

00:47.960 --> 00:49.875
[cheering and applause]

00:49.919 --> 00:51.181
MAN:
Yeah!

00:51.225 --> 00:53.227
[whistling and whooping]

00:58.493 --> 00:59.885
Two grand.

00:59.929 --> 01:01.670
Yeah.

01:01.713 --> 01:04.020
What's up?

01:04.064 --> 01:05.891
Anyone else want a piece?

01:07.676 --> 01:10.157
Still the king.[chuckles]

01:10.200 --> 01:12.594
I'll take a shot at that crown.

01:12.637 --> 01:15.205
MAN:
Whoo! Careful, man.

01:15.249 --> 01:17.555
MAN 2:
You don't want it, buddy!

01:19.383 --> 01:20.776
How much you want
to put up?

01:20.819 --> 01:22.560
Much as you want.Two racks?

01:22.604 --> 01:24.084
Make it three.Done.

01:25.563 --> 01:28.305
[engines revving]

01:30.220 --> 01:32.527
[crowd cheering]

01:39.664 --> 01:41.840
â™ª

01:42.841 --> 01:44.234
[tires screech]

01:57.552 --> 01:59.380
[cheering]

01:59.423 --> 02:01.425
[Jax chuckles]

02:01.469 --> 02:02.905
You almost had him.

02:02.948 --> 02:04.298
Yeah, I was there.

02:06.213 --> 02:08.954
What's this?
Where's the rest?

02:08.998 --> 02:10.217
I only got $200.

02:10.260 --> 02:11.305
Truth is,

02:11.348 --> 02:13.133
I really thought
I was gonna win.

02:13.176 --> 02:14.743
[grunts loudly]

02:14.786 --> 02:15.831
[crowd exclaims]

02:15.874 --> 02:18.834
[grunting]

02:20.618 --> 02:23.143
Strip his bike!

02:29.279 --> 02:30.628
Thanks, guys.
Bright and early.

02:30.672 --> 02:31.977
Thanks, man.

02:33.153 --> 02:34.980
Can I settle up, please?

02:35.024 --> 02:37.026
Room 1901.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.812
Business or pleasure?

02:41.857 --> 02:43.424
Sorry?

02:43.467 --> 02:44.990
Just want to make sure
the fella

02:45.034 --> 02:46.601
sitting alone with a strap
on his right hip

02:46.644 --> 02:47.906
isn't working
for anyone connected

02:47.950 --> 02:49.647
to the case
that I'm prosecuting.Just a cop

02:49.691 --> 02:50.822
taking a break,
watching the game.

02:50.866 --> 02:53.260
Well, then,
my apologies, Officer.

02:53.303 --> 02:55.305
That's one hell of an eye
you got there though,
spotting my piece.

02:55.349 --> 02:57.002
Blessing and a curse.

02:57.046 --> 02:57.829
You're a prosecutor, huh?

02:57.873 --> 02:58.961
Deputy D.A.

02:59.004 --> 03:00.484
Wow, that's a tough gig.

03:00.528 --> 03:01.920
Says the brother in blue.

03:01.964 --> 03:03.226
[both chuckle]

03:03.270 --> 03:04.271
Nia Wells.

03:04.314 --> 03:06.273
Daniel Harrelson.

03:06.316 --> 03:08.231
They call me Hondo though.Hondo.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.885
How is it
we've never met before?

03:09.928 --> 03:11.234
Maybe we have.

03:11.278 --> 03:14.150
No... we haven't.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.544
Your TV at home busted?

03:16.587 --> 03:18.981
[chuckles]
No, no.

03:19.024 --> 03:21.418
I, uh... Just in
the neighborhood.

03:23.246 --> 03:27.076
It's a good spot to be alone
among strangers.

03:27.119 --> 03:28.556
Sometimes it's nice
to be anonymous.

03:28.599 --> 03:30.079
What's this case
you're working on?

03:30.122 --> 03:31.385
Embezzlement and bribery.

03:31.428 --> 03:32.821
Guy funneling money
to city council members

03:32.864 --> 03:35.258
to get his way with zoning.I heard about that.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.391
That's a big trial.Big enough for the city

03:37.434 --> 03:38.957
to have me and my team up here
for the next month.

03:39.001 --> 03:40.089
How's it coming?

03:40.132 --> 03:41.612
Probably get fired
if I lose.

03:41.656 --> 03:44.702
That plus the stress
of a divorce,

03:44.746 --> 03:46.617
I'd put my life
on pause

03:46.661 --> 03:49.316
just to breathe for a minute,
if I could.

03:51.013 --> 03:52.406
So, pause.

03:54.277 --> 03:55.887
Watch the game.
I'll buy you a drink.

03:55.931 --> 03:58.499
I don't want to interrupt
your brooding.

03:58.542 --> 04:00.675
I wasn't aware that I
was, uh, I was brooding.

04:00.718 --> 04:04.244
You hide it well.
Most people wouldn't notice.

04:06.289 --> 04:08.204
Why not?

04:08.248 --> 04:11.860
I owe myself
a little downtime.
Hmm.

04:11.903 --> 04:14.341
What are you having?

04:14.384 --> 04:16.691
Double soda on the rocks.

04:16.734 --> 04:18.736
[scoffs][chuckles]

04:18.780 --> 04:20.564
Morning raid.
I got to stay sharp.

04:20.608 --> 04:22.697
Well, I'm gonna need something
a little stronger.

04:22.740 --> 04:24.133
Whatever you like.

04:26.309 --> 04:29.225
[birds chirping]

04:29.269 --> 04:30.574
How bad is it?

04:30.618 --> 04:33.098
Oh, you know,
embrace the pain, right?

04:33.142 --> 04:34.752
[grunts]

04:34.796 --> 04:36.667
CHRIS: Damn, they stripped,
like, ten grand in gear.

04:36.711 --> 04:37.886
How much you owe them?

04:37.929 --> 04:38.887
More than I had.

04:38.930 --> 04:39.931
You that hard up for cash?

04:39.975 --> 04:41.193
Not till I lost.

04:41.237 --> 04:43.108
Then what the hell
are you doing here?

04:43.152 --> 04:44.936
I thought it was easy money.
It's not a big deal.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.677
When are you gonna learn
how to check that ego?

04:46.721 --> 04:47.939
Getting kicked off of SWAT
wasn't enough?

04:47.983 --> 04:49.724
Please, please,
can we not go there?

04:49.767 --> 04:51.291
No, no, no, no.
You hauled me out of bed

04:51.334 --> 04:52.770
to come help your sorry ass.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.946
You really gonna tell me
what I can or cannot talk about?

04:54.990 --> 04:56.426
Okay.

04:56.470 --> 04:58.428
You know,
I really appreciate this.

05:01.997 --> 05:03.433
You need to make things
right with Hondo

05:03.477 --> 05:05.783
before he finds
someone permanent.Talking with Hondo's

05:05.827 --> 05:08.351
not gonna change anything.
You know how he is with me.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.788
And, honestly,
I'm in a good place.

05:10.832 --> 05:13.356
Yeah. I can tell.

05:17.186 --> 05:18.318
[door closes]

05:18.361 --> 05:20.145
Hey.Hey.

05:20.189 --> 05:22.974
My crew downstairs, but I
figured you could use a cup.

05:23.018 --> 05:25.237
Guessed no cream, no sugar?

05:25.281 --> 05:27.631
Nailed it, didn't I?

05:27.675 --> 05:30.068
Actually, uh...

05:30.112 --> 05:31.331
you did.

05:31.374 --> 05:33.158
I appreciate that.

05:33.202 --> 05:35.987
Won't fix all your problems,
but a cup of joe and great sex

05:36.031 --> 05:37.815
might knock a bit
of that edge off.

05:37.859 --> 05:42.037
Where I come from, knockin'
that edge off goes both ways.

05:43.778 --> 05:44.735
Mmm.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.171
[chuckles]Mmm. Woman,

05:46.215 --> 05:47.651
what time do you
free up tonight?

05:47.695 --> 05:49.349
Mm...

05:49.392 --> 05:51.481
As much as I like
the sound of that,

05:51.525 --> 05:53.657
already juggling a divorce
and the biggest case

05:53.701 --> 05:55.093
of my career.

05:55.137 --> 05:57.487
Not sure a SWAT hotshot
with baggage

05:57.531 --> 05:58.662
is a smart choice for me

05:58.706 --> 06:00.011
right now.Okay, wait a minute.

06:00.055 --> 06:01.273
Baggage?

06:01.317 --> 06:03.493
You really are a prosecutor,
aren't you?

06:03.537 --> 06:04.886
I'm sorry. Maybe I'm projecting.

06:04.929 --> 06:07.236
But you spend a night
like we just had,

06:07.279 --> 06:08.716
and you pick up on a few tells.

06:08.759 --> 06:10.370
Couple that

06:10.413 --> 06:12.284
with six years married
to a marshal.

06:12.328 --> 06:14.374
Your ex is a marshal?Still a couple
pen strokes

06:14.417 --> 06:15.984
from being my ex,
unfortunately.

06:16.027 --> 06:17.812
But he's already got
a new girlfriend.

06:17.855 --> 06:20.902
Beach blonde Barbie.

06:20.945 --> 06:22.643
All boobs, no ass.
[chuckles]

06:22.686 --> 06:24.645
I think maybe he's the one
with baggage.

06:24.688 --> 06:26.124
Don't all cops have some?

06:26.168 --> 06:27.909
You keep pushing
that rock,

06:27.952 --> 06:29.911
it keeps rolling back down.

06:29.954 --> 06:33.262
Add to that being a black man
in this America.

06:33.305 --> 06:35.264
At some point, you start
shutting down inside

06:35.307 --> 06:37.832
'cause the truth
gets too hard to face.

06:37.875 --> 06:39.834
Start freezing people out.

06:39.877 --> 06:41.836
Freezing people out?

06:41.879 --> 06:44.839
[chuckles] Okay, I think you
just used a bunch of fancy words

06:44.882 --> 06:46.710
to call me an angry black man.Oh,

06:46.754 --> 06:49.278
is that all you got from that?Oh, no, I heard you.

06:49.321 --> 06:50.497
It's my turn.

06:50.540 --> 06:52.847
Who am I looking at
standing in front of me?

06:52.890 --> 06:54.762
Let me see.

06:54.805 --> 06:57.808
An overachiever who probably
calculates her conviction rate

06:57.852 --> 06:59.375
down to the decimal point,

06:59.419 --> 07:01.377
insists on staying
an hour longer than anyone else,

07:01.421 --> 07:03.423
and never leaves the courtroom
without asking herself

07:03.466 --> 07:04.902
what she could have done better.

07:04.946 --> 07:07.862
And that right there
is probably the first of, what,

07:07.905 --> 07:09.777
six...

07:09.820 --> 07:12.562
cups of coffee
you'll probably have today?

07:12.606 --> 07:13.998
Am I in the zone?

07:15.609 --> 07:17.088
[chuckles]
See, this is
why two folks

07:17.132 --> 07:18.873
good at reading other people

07:18.916 --> 07:20.788
should never hook up.You just think

07:20.831 --> 07:22.920
you can read me.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.140
I'm not hiding any baggage.

07:26.184 --> 07:27.621
Right.

07:27.664 --> 07:29.274
I got to go.

07:29.318 --> 07:32.147
This case is gonna be kicking my
ass for the next month or more.

07:32.190 --> 07:35.542
And thanks
for helping me press pause.

07:35.585 --> 07:37.848
See ya.

07:39.981 --> 07:42.766
You say it's coming
from under the kitchen area?

07:42.810 --> 07:44.638
Yes, that's right.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.476
[shouting]

07:59.783 --> 08:00.915
Ought to do it.

08:00.958 --> 08:02.394
Scared him good.

08:02.438 --> 08:03.918
For how long, do you think?

08:03.961 --> 08:06.398
Oh, shouldn't be back
for five, six months, at least.

08:06.442 --> 08:09.184
Oh, thank you, thank you. Oh,

08:09.227 --> 08:10.707
you're so lucky to have
this man as your partner.

08:10.751 --> 08:13.449
He's the best cop in the city.

08:13.493 --> 08:14.755
So I'm learning.

08:18.193 --> 08:19.760
Wow.

08:19.803 --> 08:22.197
[sighs]
About ten years back,

08:22.240 --> 08:24.852
some tweaker busts
into her RV and assaults her.

08:24.895 --> 08:26.854
We arrive and my partner
had to take him out

08:26.897 --> 08:28.551
right in the living room.

08:28.595 --> 08:30.553
I can see how that'd rattle her.

08:30.597 --> 08:34.165
Ever since, she's convinced the
guy's ghost is out to get her.

08:34.209 --> 08:36.951
So you've been scaring off
the same ghost for ten years?

08:36.994 --> 08:38.605
It might not be as sexy

08:38.648 --> 08:41.477
as hanging out a helicopter
and scaling buildings,

08:41.521 --> 08:45.002
but real policing gets done
with your gun in your holster.

08:46.047 --> 08:46.874
[winces, grunts]

08:46.917 --> 08:47.918
You all right?

08:47.962 --> 08:49.833
Yeah, I'm just sore
from a workout.

08:49.877 --> 08:52.923
Thought you SWAT boys
were tougher than that.

08:52.967 --> 08:56.623
[chuckles][engine starts]

08:56.666 --> 08:57.972
WOMAN:
This isn't personal.

08:58.015 --> 08:59.582
It's city-wide.

08:59.626 --> 09:02.454
I need to trim $200 million
off LAPD's budget.

09:02.498 --> 09:04.282
You saying that money should
come out of every department

09:04.326 --> 09:05.501
except yours?

09:05.545 --> 09:07.329
We're the city's
last line of defense.

09:07.372 --> 09:10.071
When other cops are in trouble,
we're the ones they call.

09:10.114 --> 09:11.289
I'm not looking to change that.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.900
But I come
from corporate America,

09:12.943 --> 09:14.597
and I've seen
how companies find ways

09:14.641 --> 09:16.077
to be more efficient
when forced to.

09:16.120 --> 09:18.514
Look, I get how, studying
line items and bar graphs,

09:18.558 --> 09:20.255
you might think
there's fat to trim here,

09:20.298 --> 09:22.997
but we're running as lean
as we can without risking lives.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.651
And I get how you
think that's true,

09:24.694 --> 09:26.609
but my experience
says different.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.002
You say
this isn't personal,

09:28.045 --> 09:29.786
but I can't help feeling
like we're being targeted

09:29.830 --> 09:30.787
by the new commissioner.

09:30.831 --> 09:31.919
You're not
being targeted.

09:31.962 --> 09:33.834
You're just not
being favored anymore.

09:33.877 --> 09:35.444
You were the darlings
under Michael Plank.

09:35.487 --> 09:36.750
Now it's a level field.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.926
We need more,
because we do more.

09:38.969 --> 09:40.318
It's unpleasant,

09:40.362 --> 09:42.538
but things change
and you need to change with 'em.

09:42.582 --> 09:45.323
By 15%.

09:50.154 --> 09:51.634
LUCA:
Number five today.

09:51.678 --> 09:53.027
We haul his ass in,

09:53.070 --> 09:54.855
we're halfway through
Metro's Most Wanted.

09:54.898 --> 09:56.944
Well, there's a reason today's
target has been so tough

09:56.987 --> 09:59.511
to grab. Dude's smart
and crafty as hell.

09:59.555 --> 10:00.774
Nothing's gonna
beat number two.

10:00.817 --> 10:01.992
The little guy
with the Gatling?

10:02.036 --> 10:03.080
DEACON: Yeah, that gun
was as big as he was.

10:03.124 --> 10:04.691
He shot the hell out
of it though.

10:04.734 --> 10:05.779
HONDO: Hey, Beni,
I appreciate you

10:05.822 --> 10:07.650
riding with us
while we're a man down.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.391
Long as Metro's crazy
enough to give you a team,

10:09.434 --> 10:10.697
I'll pinch-hit anytime.[chuckles]

10:10.740 --> 10:13.438
Street says hello.

10:16.877 --> 10:19.227
Oh, yeah? How's he doing?

10:19.270 --> 10:20.881
About how you'd expect.
You should ask him yourself,

10:20.924 --> 10:22.099
if you're curious.

10:24.711 --> 10:26.364
Let's roll, people.

10:30.064 --> 10:31.718
Our primary target
is Mack Drummond.

10:31.761 --> 10:33.545
Chances are he'll have
a Haitian wingman

10:33.589 --> 10:34.851
named Sal Desir with him.

10:34.895 --> 10:35.896
He's the guy who brings
the kids over

10:35.939 --> 10:37.245
before they auction 'em off.

10:37.288 --> 10:38.899
After he buys 'em
off their parents.

10:38.942 --> 10:40.683
What kind of lowlife
sells children as servants?

10:40.727 --> 10:42.511
The kind about to get
served a smackdown.

10:42.554 --> 10:43.686
[chuckles]LUCA:
Poor kids.

10:43.730 --> 10:44.948
I mean,
the lucky ones end up

10:44.992 --> 10:46.733
as only servants.HONDO:
Well, these guys

10:46.776 --> 10:48.125
are as low
as they come.

10:48.169 --> 10:49.692
They could be holding up
to a dozen child hostages,

10:49.736 --> 10:50.911
waiting to auction 'em off.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.695
So be sure of your targets.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.436
Watch your backstops and beyond.

10:54.479 --> 10:56.090
We're gonna run
a covert clearing off

10:56.133 --> 10:57.221
of me.

10:57.265 --> 10:58.396
I want to be right on top
of these guys

10:58.440 --> 10:59.571
before they even know
we're there.

Let's take a minute

14:28.650 --> 14:29.738
He's pinned down
under some rubble.

14:29.781 --> 14:31.261
He's not a threat.

14:31.305 --> 14:32.697
Get those kids out.

You come back for me later.
I'll be all right.

14:36.571 --> 14:38.660
I'll be here.

Hey, he's okay, though?Says he is.

14:41.619 --> 14:42.838
You hear anything from Drummond
or those kids?

14:42.882 --> 14:43.926
Nothing.
Either he can't hear us

14:43.970 --> 14:45.145
or Drummond's
keeping the kids quiet.

14:45.188 --> 14:46.450
We can punch through,

14:46.494 --> 14:48.061
but we might bring down
more structure if we do.

14:48.104 --> 14:49.714
Nobody's getting
in or out this way.

14:49.758 --> 14:50.933
We circle around outside,
we see

if we can find
a safer point of entry.

Point that gun down so I can
see how we can get out of here.

How about you start
by helping me free my leg?

15:19.092 --> 15:21.659
I'm not sure why
I would do that.

15:21.703 --> 15:24.662
Well, it looks like we're gonna
be here for a long time

15:24.706 --> 15:26.012
until you change your mind.

15:31.017 --> 15:32.409
Listen up!

15:32.453 --> 15:34.977
Power and cell services
are down across the city,

15:35.021 --> 15:37.849
so remember
your EPU disaster protocols.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.851
Our comms are gonna run
through FirstNet,

15:39.895 --> 15:41.505
but for the general public,

15:41.549 --> 15:43.290
we've got ten million
panicked Angelenos

15:43.333 --> 15:45.683
with no phone, Internet
or traffic signals.

15:45.727 --> 15:47.685
Hospitals are already
being flooded.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.992
Emergency Management is asking
us to take the overflow

15:50.036 --> 15:51.994
of minor injuries from
St. Vincent and Gateways.

15:52.038 --> 15:53.082
I'll round up all our medics

15:53.126 --> 15:54.562
and set up a triage center
in the gym.

15:54.605 --> 15:55.780
All right. Next up,

15:55.824 --> 15:57.521
Metro Detention
took some damage.

15:57.565 --> 16:00.611
With no cameras and alarms,
inmates are making a move.

16:00.655 --> 16:02.570
I'll grab my team and
keep the bad guys inside

16:02.613 --> 16:04.006
where they belong.All right. Watch your backs.

16:04.050 --> 16:05.529
Always do.All right, the rest of you

16:05.573 --> 16:07.183
hit the streets
and assist where needed.

16:07.227 --> 16:09.359
Retirement homes and schools
are requesting help.

16:09.403 --> 16:12.188
Also, dispatch has a list
of jewelry and gun dealers.

16:12.232 --> 16:14.190
Weapons and gold
are prime looter targets.

16:14.234 --> 16:16.671
Let's keep 'em out
of the wrong hands.

16:19.456 --> 16:21.458
Everything all right?

16:21.502 --> 16:24.026
It's my daughter. She's
a freshman at Occidental.

16:24.070 --> 16:25.985
Right next to the epicenter.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.943
Cell service must be out.

16:27.987 --> 16:30.554
I need to go find her.

16:30.598 --> 16:33.079
Wait. The roads are a mess.

16:33.122 --> 16:35.037
It'll take you hours
to get there.

16:35.081 --> 16:37.213
Give me her name.
I'll make a few calls

16:37.257 --> 16:39.085
and see if we can locate her.

16:39.128 --> 16:42.827
Thank you. Really.

16:42.871 --> 16:46.483
Biggest quake in a while.Had to be, like, a 7.0, right?

16:46.527 --> 16:48.311
Maybe higher.Northridge was massive,

16:48.355 --> 16:50.313
and it was only a 6.7.
This was close, though.

16:50.357 --> 16:52.489
Maybe 6.5, 6.6. Felt shallow.

16:52.533 --> 16:53.838
Maybe ten miles down.

16:53.882 --> 16:55.231
The shallow ones,
they shake harder,

16:55.275 --> 16:56.363
but they don't travel as far.Damn, Luca.

16:56.406 --> 16:57.625
That's serious tremor knowledge.

16:57.668 --> 16:59.148
Well, it was kind of
my thing growing up.

16:59.192 --> 17:01.150
All right, listen up.
Looks like we can breach

17:01.194 --> 17:02.586
on the third floor.
Tan, see if you can find

17:02.630 --> 17:03.848
a pathway to the kids.

17:03.892 --> 17:05.328
Beni, Chris, cover him. Go, Tan.

17:05.372 --> 17:07.330
All right, Luca, you got
right side, I got left.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.690
Hey, I got a handprint here.

17:19.734 --> 17:21.649
Fresh blood. Looks like Drummond
may have taken off.

17:21.692 --> 17:23.216
HONDO:
Roger that. Tan, make entry.

17:23.259 --> 17:25.131
Get to the kids. Keep them there

17:25.174 --> 17:27.872
until we contain the threat.Roger that.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.483
All right, Chris,
Luca, you go right.
Yeah.

17:29.526 --> 17:30.962
Beni, you're with
me. Let's move.

17:31.006 --> 17:32.225
Let's go.

17:33.748 --> 17:35.358
The rest of my team's
gonna have your partner

17:35.402 --> 17:36.794
in custody soon
if they don't have him already.

17:36.838 --> 17:38.100
What are the chances

17:38.144 --> 17:39.623
he tries to pin
this whole operation on you?

17:39.667 --> 17:41.103
He's not my partner.

17:41.147 --> 17:42.887
All the more reason
to let you take the fall.

17:42.931 --> 17:45.977
You help me get out of here,
you testify against him,

17:46.021 --> 17:47.892
I promise things will go
a lot smoother for you.

17:47.936 --> 17:49.372
Can you get me
to go back to Haiti?

17:49.416 --> 17:51.157
I can make sure you don't die
an old man in prison.

17:51.200 --> 17:53.898
Have you been to Haiti?My church did some aid work

17:53.942 --> 17:55.596
down there
after the earthquake in 2010.

17:55.639 --> 17:56.814
I didn't make it down.

17:56.858 --> 18:00.514
Yeah. My wife died
in that earthquake.

18:03.343 --> 18:05.301
I'm sorry to hear that.

18:05.345 --> 18:08.304
My sons were two and three.

18:08.348 --> 18:10.263
It must have been
incredibly hard for them.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.874
And you.

18:12.917 --> 18:14.658
[sighs]

18:14.702 --> 18:16.486
Have you heard
of the word "restavek"?

18:16.530 --> 18:19.881
There are 300,000
restavekin Haiti.

18:19.924 --> 18:22.492
One out of 15 children.

18:22.536 --> 18:24.451
You mean, like, orphans?No.

18:24.494 --> 18:26.192
They have no word
in English for that.

18:26.235 --> 18:28.150
They're servants.

18:28.194 --> 18:30.631
They come from families
too poor to feed them,

18:30.674 --> 18:32.502
so they live with the rich,

18:32.546 --> 18:34.461
who feed them
in exchange for labor.

18:34.504 --> 18:37.159
We do have a word for that.
It's slavery.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.074
That's not slavery.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.512
They are families who do
whatever they must to survive.

18:42.556 --> 18:43.948
They are not slaves.

18:50.259 --> 18:54.394
After my wife died,
my kids were starving.

18:54.437 --> 18:57.745
I knew if they stayed with me,
they would die.

18:57.788 --> 19:00.356
So, a man came and offered

19:00.400 --> 19:02.706
to place them for me.

19:02.750 --> 19:05.796
But I couldn't let them go.

19:05.840 --> 19:09.409
I told him that I would find
other children for him

19:09.452 --> 19:11.672
if he helped me feed my own.

19:11.715 --> 19:15.154
First, it was just
the restavekin Haiti.

19:17.243 --> 19:20.246
And then Drummond came.

19:20.289 --> 19:22.465
And he wanted you
to smuggle the kids out for him.

19:22.509 --> 19:25.381
That meant I could feed
and educate my kids.

19:25.425 --> 19:27.427
You didn't have a choice.

19:29.951 --> 19:31.909
But you do now.

19:31.953 --> 19:33.998
Look around.
You-You're like Jonah

19:34.042 --> 19:36.218
in the belly of the whale.
You got no way out.

19:36.262 --> 19:38.525
Don't you think
that maybe...

19:38.568 --> 19:41.658
maybe this is God
giving you a shot to repent?

19:47.490 --> 19:49.797
You smell that?

19:49.840 --> 19:51.886
One of the gas lines
must be busted.

19:51.929 --> 19:54.018
All right,
we got to get out of here

19:54.062 --> 19:56.456
before something sparks it
and this whole place goes up.

19:56.499 --> 19:57.674
You pull that trigger now,

19:57.718 --> 20:00.024
you kill us both.
And all those kids.

Beni, Beni.WOMAN:
Help!

21:12.836 --> 21:13.924
[tires screeching]

21:13.968 --> 21:16.666
Help! Help! Help!

21:16.710 --> 21:17.798
Help!

21:17.841 --> 21:19.147
He's gonna kill that kid!

21:19.190 --> 21:20.496
Let's get a car. Get a car.

21:20.540 --> 21:22.193
It's okay.I'll call for air support.

21:22.237 --> 21:24.108
Tell me what happened.Uh, he was gonna shoot me,

21:24.152 --> 21:26.807
and the kid stabbed him,
and he saved my life.Stabbed him where?

21:26.850 --> 21:28.417
Stabbed him where? With what?I don't know. In the side.

21:28.461 --> 21:29.766
I don't know...

21:29.810 --> 21:31.812
Captain, I have an armed suspect

21:31.855 --> 21:33.509
with a child hostage
in a stolen vehicle.

21:33.553 --> 21:34.858
I need eyes in the sky ASAP.

21:34.902 --> 21:36.251
I'm not sure how long
this kid's got.

21:42.388 --> 21:44.390
[distant chatter]

21:47.175 --> 21:50.309
WOMAN:
Help! Help!

21:50.352 --> 21:51.484
[electrical buzzing]WOMAN:
Someone help her.

21:51.527 --> 21:52.572
WOMAN 2:
Please help me.

21:58.099 --> 21:59.492
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:59.535 --> 22:01.624
[gasps]
TONY:
I'll radio Fire,

22:01.668 --> 22:03.365
see if we can get
a ladder truck.There's no time.

22:03.409 --> 22:04.453
You got a better idea?

22:04.497 --> 22:06.150
[electrical buzzing]

22:06.194 --> 22:07.935
Please.

22:12.200 --> 22:14.463
STREET:
Hang on. I'm coming for you![whimpers]

22:14.507 --> 22:16.683
HICKS:
I need you to clear
the squad cars

22:16.726 --> 22:19.033
from the motor pool to make room
for the incoming victims.

22:19.076 --> 22:21.383
And, Kevin, make sure there's
enough juice in the generator

22:21.427 --> 22:23.254
to get us through the day.

22:23.298 --> 22:25.387
JESSICA:
All of our resources are
overloaded right now.

22:25.431 --> 22:27.650
I-I'll see what I can do.
Everyone's spread thin.

22:27.694 --> 22:29.173
Kevin, find me an airship

22:29.217 --> 22:31.175
to assist a vehicle pursuit
in Highland Park.

22:31.219 --> 22:32.742
HONDO:
How bad is it out there?

22:32.786 --> 22:34.483
So far, we've got
three overpasses down

22:34.527 --> 22:35.876
and five collapsed structures,

22:35.919 --> 22:37.530
including
the Tinsley hotel downtown.

22:37.573 --> 22:39.880
Eight dead, dozens injured.

22:39.923 --> 22:41.360
Still pulling people out.

22:41.403 --> 22:43.884
I have a friend
staying at the Tinsley.

22:43.927 --> 22:45.364
Any IDs on the victims?

22:45.407 --> 22:46.930
No, not yet.

22:46.974 --> 22:48.497
You think they were still there
when the quake hit?

22:48.541 --> 22:49.933
I don't know.
I don't know. I'm not sure.

22:49.977 --> 22:52.545
I hope not.Got us a ride, boss.
Come on, let's go.

22:54.024 --> 22:55.983
Hondo, I got you a news chopper.

22:56.026 --> 22:57.811
They're willing to help.All right, roger that.

22:57.854 --> 23:00.030
Suspect is driving a red
vintage-model Buick Apollo.

23:00.074 --> 23:01.423
We're in pursuit.

23:01.467 --> 23:03.120
Chris, you and Beni help Tan

23:03.164 --> 23:05.993
get those kids out,
then go check on Deac.

23:06.036 --> 23:08.430
[tires screeching]

23:08.474 --> 23:10.867
[electrical hissing]Just hang tight.
My partner's gonna get you

23:10.911 --> 23:13.043
out of there.I'm coming for you.

23:13.087 --> 23:14.741
You just stay calm.
Let me do the work.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.264
What's your name?

23:16.307 --> 23:17.744
My name's Jan.

23:17.787 --> 23:19.310
Have you been rock climbing,
Jan?
No.

23:19.354 --> 23:20.703
I'm afraid of heights.

23:20.747 --> 23:22.313
Okay.

23:22.357 --> 23:26.013
Well, good news is, this
is nothing like that.

23:28.015 --> 23:31.845
All right, Jan, I'm gonna lower
myself down to come get you.

23:31.888 --> 23:34.717
Okay.You just got to hang tight,
and I'll pull us back up, okay?

23:34.761 --> 23:36.893
[loud rumbling]

23:36.937 --> 23:38.808
Aftershock!

23:44.292 --> 23:46.468
[spectators gasp]

23:46.512 --> 23:47.948
[grunts]
[panting]

23:47.991 --> 23:50.211
Ah.
TONY:
You guys all right in there?

23:50.254 --> 23:52.039
A couple scratches.

23:52.082 --> 23:53.562
Nice work, Tarzan.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.259
[chuckles]

23:55.303 --> 23:56.478
Best first date
ever, right?

23:56.522 --> 23:57.871
[laughs]
Yeah.

23:57.914 --> 23:59.873
[grunts]

23:59.916 --> 24:01.918
[sniffs]

24:01.962 --> 24:03.790
Anybody copy?CHRIS:
Loud and clear.

24:03.833 --> 24:05.618
Beni and I are heading your way.We got to get

24:05.661 --> 24:06.923
these kids out now.

24:06.967 --> 24:07.924
Think there's a gas leak.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.317
Roger that.

24:10.492 --> 24:11.580
[yelling]You know, the two of us

24:11.624 --> 24:12.668
could move that thing,
no problem.

24:12.712 --> 24:14.757
Or we just wait
for another aftershock

24:14.801 --> 24:17.151
and hope that this whole
building doesn't explode.I will die trying.

24:17.194 --> 24:19.283
I need to get back to my boys.Yeah?

24:19.327 --> 24:20.937
[grunting]Wouldn't it be better to live

24:20.981 --> 24:22.548
so you can tell 'em how
you saved another man's life?

24:22.591 --> 24:24.898
Wouldn't that set
a better example?

24:24.941 --> 24:26.943
[panting]

24:29.032 --> 24:30.991
I got three kids.

24:31.034 --> 24:33.646
I got a fourth on the way.

24:35.561 --> 24:38.607
I know how deep
that love runs for them,

24:38.651 --> 24:42.437
and I know how hard...
you want to get back to them.

24:42.481 --> 24:45.179
You know that they'd be
better off with you alive.

24:45.222 --> 24:47.137
[whimpers]

24:47.181 --> 24:49.183
[panting]

24:49.226 --> 24:51.228
Knowing that you...
you did the right thing?

24:53.013 --> 24:54.971
[whimpers]

24:55.015 --> 24:56.843
[yells]

24:56.886 --> 24:58.975
[breathing heavily]

24:59.019 --> 25:02.022
All I've done has been
for my kids.

25:02.065 --> 25:05.112
Everything I've done has been
for my boys.

25:05.155 --> 25:07.549
I don't doubt that...

25:07.593 --> 25:11.553
but if they were here
right now...

25:11.597 --> 25:14.600
if they were here to see you,

25:14.643 --> 25:16.645
what would they tell you to do?

25:30.746 --> 25:32.922
[panting]

25:44.499 --> 25:47.023
JESSICA:
SKY2 says
he's a half mile up, going

25:47.067 --> 25:49.112
south on Huntington Drive.He's headed to the 10.

25:49.156 --> 25:50.766
Probably figures with
the earthquake chaos,

25:50.810 --> 25:52.768
we won't have the manpower
to shut down the freeway.

25:52.812 --> 25:54.030
Yeah, well, he figures right.
If he makes it that far,

25:54.074 --> 25:55.379
we're gonna be
chasing this guy out of town.

25:55.423 --> 25:57.556
And if he has enough gas,
he'll outrun us.

25:57.599 --> 25:58.774
Hey, Luca, gun it down Eastern.
Try to get

25:58.818 --> 26:00.602
in front of him
and cut him off.
All over it.

26:00.646 --> 26:01.951
PILOT:
I see your team rerouting.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.213
Should be in position
to intercept

26:03.257 --> 26:04.519
before the freeway ramp.

26:04.563 --> 26:05.868
Roger that, SKY2.

26:05.912 --> 26:07.391
Scratch that.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.176
Suspect now turning west
on Valley Boulevard.

26:09.219 --> 26:10.873
Reroute. Drummond's now
westbound on Valley.

26:10.917 --> 26:12.571
Repeat, westbound.

26:12.614 --> 26:15.182
That takes him awayfrom
the freeway. Where the hell is

26:15.225 --> 26:17.140
this guy going?Ah, it's gonna be a bitch
catching up to him now.

26:17.184 --> 26:18.968
Sorry, Captain. We just had
a third hospital start diverting

26:19.012 --> 26:20.622
to us, and we're out of space
in the gym.

26:20.666 --> 26:22.058
Use the locker room.

26:22.102 --> 26:23.494
Kitchen if you need to.

26:23.538 --> 26:25.584
Commander, I got
a freeway collapse across town.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.411
Needs visual support
for rescue ops.

26:27.455 --> 26:28.804
Gonna have to abort.

26:28.848 --> 26:30.197
All right, roger that, SKY2.

26:30.240 --> 26:31.590
Looks like your suspect

26:31.633 --> 26:33.374
is turning south
on Mission Road.

26:33.417 --> 26:35.202
I'll give another 20
before I lose visual.

26:35.245 --> 26:36.899
Apologies, Commander.Sorry, Hondo.

26:36.943 --> 26:38.727
We just lost our eyes.HONDO:
Captain, we're gonna

26:38.771 --> 26:40.033
be on this guy in three minutes.

26:40.076 --> 26:41.904
Can you buys us some more time?Negative.

26:41.948 --> 26:43.166
They got pulled
for a rescue.

26:43.210 --> 26:45.038
Drummond's still heading
toward downtown.

26:45.081 --> 26:47.170
Now going south on Mission.It's gonna be
like trying

26:47.214 --> 26:48.911
to find a needle
in a haystack down there.

26:48.955 --> 26:52.001
[groaning]

26:52.045 --> 26:53.655
Hey, sorry.

26:53.699 --> 26:56.310
Gas smell's getting stronger.I'll bring the last one.

26:56.353 --> 26:58.355
[grunts]
Come on.

26:58.399 --> 27:00.488
[screaming]Hey...

27:00.531 --> 27:02.098
Hey, I'm not gonna
hurt you, okay?

27:02.142 --> 27:03.622
I promise. I just want
to help you out here.

27:03.665 --> 27:04.971
[screaming]

27:05.014 --> 27:07.016
TAN:
No, no, no.

27:07.060 --> 27:08.539
No, no. I got you.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.106
Come on. Shh, shh, shh.

27:10.150 --> 27:11.630
I got you.
I got you, all right?

27:11.673 --> 27:13.370
Okay. Let's go.

27:13.414 --> 27:15.285
Get these kids out
on the fire escape.

27:15.329 --> 27:18.201
[grunting]

27:19.333 --> 27:20.377
All right.

27:26.209 --> 27:28.168
[sighs]

27:30.561 --> 27:32.955
[sighs]
After you.

27:32.999 --> 27:35.610
Nice try.
[sighs]

27:39.745 --> 27:41.703
[panicked chatter nearby]

27:49.232 --> 27:51.017
[explosion][grunts]

27:54.107 --> 27:56.544
[grunting]

27:56.587 --> 27:59.634
Now, now, get down. Down, down,
down, down, down. Get down.

27:59.678 --> 28:01.897
[grunts]Shouldn't have run.

28:01.941 --> 28:04.204
I heard the bang.
You all right?
Better now.

28:04.247 --> 28:05.684
Did you get the kids out?

28:05.727 --> 28:07.207
I'm working on it.

28:07.250 --> 28:08.512
Let's go, let's go.
All your friends are down here.

28:08.556 --> 28:09.513
Come on.

28:09.557 --> 28:10.863
Let's go.
Come on, buddy.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.212
Come on, buddy.
You can do this.

28:12.255 --> 28:13.343
DEACON:
All right, it's okay.

28:13.387 --> 28:15.606
It's okay.
We got him.

28:15.650 --> 28:17.521
Deacon! I thought
he was out of commission.

28:17.565 --> 28:19.262
Good thing he wasn't.
You smell gas?

28:19.306 --> 28:21.700
Yeah. I got
the rest of 'em down,

28:21.743 --> 28:23.484
but this one won't
let me touch him.CHRIS: Hey.

28:23.527 --> 28:25.355
Let's move this way. Come on.Move, move!

28:25.399 --> 28:27.227
Come on. Keep walking.TAN:
Come on, please.

28:27.270 --> 28:28.228
No.
We have to go now.

28:28.271 --> 28:30.012
No, no.It's okay. It's okay.

28:32.275 --> 28:33.624
Stanley.

28:39.326 --> 28:42.242
Let's go. [grunts]

28:53.906 --> 28:54.907
[Tan screams]

29:03.393 --> 29:05.526
[groans, panting]

29:05.569 --> 29:07.528
Speak French?

29:07.571 --> 29:10.096
You don't?

29:10.139 --> 29:12.359
So, that's all the kids?All but one.

29:12.402 --> 29:13.752
Drummond got away
with a hostage.

29:24.327 --> 29:26.112
All our intel tells us
this guy doesn't have anyone

29:26.155 --> 29:27.940
who wants to help him
here in L.A.

29:27.983 --> 29:30.464
Yeah, and with cops spread thin,
there's no better time to run.

29:30.507 --> 29:31.813
He should be heading out
of town, not into it.

29:31.857 --> 29:33.075
So what's his plan?

29:33.119 --> 29:34.947
It doesn't make
sense, man.

29:34.990 --> 29:37.079
That quake hits
two minutes later, we would have

29:37.123 --> 29:38.646
had him back at that raid.

29:38.689 --> 29:40.300
Yeah, he's probably
the only guy in L.A.

29:40.343 --> 29:42.084
the shaking actually helped.

29:42.128 --> 29:44.783
Look, I hope your friend made
it out of that hotel okay.

29:44.826 --> 29:46.828
Yeah. Yeah, so do I.

29:46.872 --> 29:49.309
I can't think
about that right now.

29:49.352 --> 29:52.007
Wait a minute.

29:52.051 --> 29:54.531
Wait a minute, Luca,
what if Drummond's not okay?

29:54.575 --> 29:55.837
The witness said

29:55.881 --> 29:57.447
the kid shanked
him pretty good.

29:57.491 --> 29:59.667
What if he needs to get
patched up before he can run?

29:59.710 --> 30:01.451
And with all the injuries,

30:01.495 --> 30:03.671
an ER downtown won't think
twice about how he got stuck.

30:03.714 --> 30:06.282
Hey, Captain! Captain,
track Drummond's route

30:06.326 --> 30:08.110
from the carjacking
to where we lost him.

30:08.154 --> 30:09.982
See if any of it points
to hospitals or ERs.

30:10.025 --> 30:11.200
JESSICA:
Looking now.

30:11.244 --> 30:13.507
SKY2 had Drummond
heading south on Hill

30:13.550 --> 30:14.813
just before they
lost visual.

30:14.856 --> 30:15.988
JESSICA:
Which leads him

30:16.031 --> 30:18.120
through downtown... to here.Mm-hmm.

30:18.164 --> 30:21.558
If he stays on Hill,
it would take him

30:21.602 --> 30:23.125
right by Kinney Memorial.Roger that.

30:23.169 --> 30:25.171
Show us en route.
Go, go, go.
Go.

30:25.214 --> 30:26.476
I'm sorry, Captain.

30:26.520 --> 30:28.522
I know you're incredibly busy.

30:28.565 --> 30:30.480
I'm just wondering
if you've heard anything.

30:30.524 --> 30:32.700
I have, actually.
Good news.

30:32.743 --> 30:34.963
I spoke with campus
police personally, and

30:35.007 --> 30:36.486
they assured me they only had
a few minor injuries.

30:36.530 --> 30:37.966
No one seriously hurt.

30:38.010 --> 30:40.142
But you don't know
about Stacey specifically?

30:40.186 --> 30:42.710
They haven't found her yet?We're still
working on it.

30:42.753 --> 30:45.321
Now, I apologize, but we
need to assist our people

30:45.365 --> 30:46.757
in the field.

30:46.801 --> 30:48.585
Of course.
Do what you need to do.

30:51.806 --> 30:55.201
[woman speaks indistinctly
over P.A.]

30:55.244 --> 30:56.550
MAN:
You might have a case

30:56.593 --> 30:57.943
against that contractor

30:57.986 --> 30:59.466
if that scaffolding
wasn't secured right.

30:59.509 --> 31:00.902
Yeah, I'll talk
to my union rep.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.208
Lucky that rebar
wasn't longer,

31:02.251 --> 31:03.992
or it would have
punctured your lung.

31:04.036 --> 31:05.428
Is that a flight medic?

31:05.472 --> 31:06.908
Oh, they've been in
and out all day.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.562
Just medevac'd in a couple

31:08.605 --> 31:10.129
of construction guys who took
a tumble when the quake hit.

31:10.172 --> 31:12.522
You guys got
a helipad here?

31:12.566 --> 31:14.437
We did. Got damaged
in the earthquake.

31:14.481 --> 31:16.787
We're using one
on the bank building next door.

31:20.226 --> 31:21.836
HONDO:
Metro SWAT.
Out of the way!

31:24.056 --> 31:26.754
You Nick? Charge nurse says
you were treating a guy with

31:26.797 --> 31:28.364
a puncture wound
to his left abdomen.

31:28.408 --> 31:30.758
Construction accident.
Piece of rebar?Where can I find him?

31:30.801 --> 31:33.761
I finished up with him.
He's over there.

31:33.804 --> 31:35.458
Well, he was just there.
We were talking

31:35.502 --> 31:37.896
about the construction guys
that just medevac'd in.

31:39.506 --> 31:41.943
Did he have a kid with him?No, he was alone.

31:41.987 --> 31:43.597
Okay, what was he
asking, exactly?

31:43.640 --> 31:45.729
Wanted to know
where they land the helicopter.

31:45.773 --> 31:47.775
And?
I told him
we're using the helipad

31:47.818 --> 31:48.994
on the bank building
next door.

31:49.037 --> 31:50.343
Luca.
Go.

31:50.386 --> 31:52.388
Out of the way. Excuse me.Excuse me.

31:52.432 --> 31:54.782
[door opens]

32:03.312 --> 32:04.270
Nothing.

32:04.313 --> 32:06.098
[gunfire]

32:06.141 --> 32:07.360
Don't come up here!

32:07.403 --> 32:08.578
HONDO:
This is 20-David.

32:08.622 --> 32:10.450
I have a fatality in
the north stairwell.

32:10.493 --> 32:12.278
I need someone to
patch through to

32:12.321 --> 32:13.627
the medevac bird
on the roof.

32:13.670 --> 32:15.455
Tell the pilot to
take off immediately.

32:15.498 --> 32:16.978
Luca, let's move.

32:20.460 --> 32:22.201
Luca, right side!

32:22.244 --> 32:24.638
Hey! Hey!

32:24.681 --> 32:26.945
Don't you move!
Don't you move.

32:32.515 --> 32:33.952
Cover me. Go!

32:34.822 --> 32:36.171
Go! Now!

32:40.349 --> 32:41.916
[grunting]

32:42.569 --> 32:44.266
Hondo!

32:49.054 --> 32:50.011
[grunts]

32:51.882 --> 32:53.362
[grunting]

33:00.239 --> 33:01.240

33:05.461 --> 33:07.768
â™ª

33:07.811 --> 33:09.683
[both grunting]

33:09.726 --> 33:11.728
No!

33:21.216 --> 33:23.218
â™ª

33:25.003 --> 33:26.613
[groaning]

33:38.146 --> 33:39.452
Where's the boy?

33:50.811 --> 33:51.812
[Luca murmuring]

33:51.855 --> 33:54.684
[key clicks in lock]

33:55.598 --> 33:57.557
Hey. Hey, you're okay.

33:57.600 --> 33:59.298
You're okay.
We got you.

33:59.341 --> 34:00.560
Here we go.
Got it.

34:00.603 --> 34:02.083
Hey.

34:02.127 --> 34:03.824
You okay?

34:03.867 --> 34:05.434
You're all right.All right, you're good.

34:05.478 --> 34:07.045
You all right?

34:07.088 --> 34:09.134
Are you hurt?
Are you hurt?

34:10.570 --> 34:11.658
Do you speak English?

34:11.701 --> 34:13.877
All right, it's all right.

34:13.921 --> 34:15.183
You're safe, okay?

34:15.227 --> 34:16.619
Look at me, you're safe.

34:28.283 --> 34:33.114
I have the contacts
at both ports.

34:33.158 --> 34:35.725
And the buyers in New York
and Atlanta.

34:35.769 --> 34:37.249
I will give you everything.

34:38.772 --> 34:43.429
I never wanted to hurt
other children.

34:43.472 --> 34:45.953
Only to protect my own.

34:45.996 --> 34:48.738
You're doing the right thing.

34:48.782 --> 34:51.393
Do you think
I will see them again?

34:51.437 --> 34:55.049
You play ball with the D.A.

34:55.093 --> 34:56.616
You testify to everything
you know.

34:58.270 --> 35:01.925
Guarantee it.

35:01.969 --> 35:03.927
They'll be older,
but you'll see 'em.

35:03.971 --> 35:06.713
If they survive.

35:06.756 --> 35:08.628
They will.

35:12.675 --> 35:14.938
[sighs]

35:18.855 --> 35:20.422
Mom,

35:20.466 --> 35:22.946
you didn't have
to send the cops for me.

35:22.990 --> 35:24.426
I was totally fine.

35:24.470 --> 35:25.775
I didn't know that.

35:25.819 --> 35:27.386
A mother's allowed to worry.

35:27.429 --> 35:29.257
All the good ones do.

35:29.301 --> 35:31.129
I can't thank you enough
for this.

35:31.172 --> 35:32.956
Wasn't a typical day, but
hopefully you got a sense

35:33.000 --> 35:35.350
of all the work
we do here at Metro.

35:35.394 --> 35:36.830
SWAT's not the prima donna
that some members

35:36.873 --> 35:38.614
of the commission
would have you believe.

35:38.658 --> 35:41.269
LAPD's lucky to have you
setting the bar.So you can see now

35:41.313 --> 35:43.793
how our division
requires extra resources.

35:43.837 --> 35:49.451
I do... but unfortunately

35:49.495 --> 35:53.368
the math is still the math,
and our budget is only going

35:53.412 --> 35:54.848
to get tighter with all
the earthquake damage.

35:54.891 --> 35:56.850
15% is gonna be impossible

35:56.893 --> 35:58.547
without seriously
reducing personnel.

36:05.380 --> 36:07.339
CHRIS:
"Power and cell service

36:07.382 --> 36:10.559
"is 90% restored after the
largest tremor in over 20 years.

36:10.603 --> 36:12.953
"The quake measures 6.6
on the Richter scale

36:12.996 --> 36:15.085
with an estimated
depth of 12 miles."

36:15.129 --> 36:16.478
Damn, Luca,
you nailed it.

36:16.522 --> 36:18.437
LUCA: Yup.CHRIS: Yup.
[barks]

36:18.480 --> 36:20.787
Duke!
What are you doing here, boy?

36:20.830 --> 36:23.050
Come on up, up, up.
STREET:
We were by your place,

36:23.093 --> 36:24.747
just figured I'd just
check in on him.
Aw.

36:24.791 --> 36:26.314
[Chris chuckles]STREET:
It's pretty trashed, Luca.

36:26.358 --> 36:28.490
There's a broken window, and...
I thought he might try

36:28.534 --> 36:30.057
to get out; it didn't
feel right to leave him.

36:30.100 --> 36:31.189
Appreciate it, man.

36:32.277 --> 36:33.887
That was good of you, Street.

36:35.976 --> 36:37.238
Did you, uh, catch
Hondo out there?

36:37.282 --> 36:39.197
No, I didn't-didn't see him.

36:39.240 --> 36:41.634
Well, maybe you should talk
to him before you go.

36:41.677 --> 36:43.636
And say what?

36:43.679 --> 36:46.029
Come on. That you
want another shot.

36:46.073 --> 36:48.771
We both know you do.

36:48.815 --> 36:50.295
So how was it out there
for you guys?

36:50.338 --> 36:51.296
Got pretty hairy.
Yeah.

36:51.339 --> 36:52.340
But this guy?

36:52.384 --> 36:53.994
He earned his paycheck today.

36:54.037 --> 36:55.343
What'd you do out there, Street?

36:55.387 --> 36:57.824
Nah, it was nothing,
it was nothing.
You kidding?

36:57.867 --> 37:01.306
He risked his ass saving this
woman from getting electrocuted.

37:01.349 --> 37:03.960
She was stuck on top of this
newspaper dispenser, right?All right.

37:04.004 --> 37:05.527
He hit me like I
stole something.

37:05.571 --> 37:07.573
[both laugh]

37:09.749 --> 37:11.620
Hey, what's up, Street?

37:15.407 --> 37:17.539
Hey, Hondo.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.889
CHRIS:
Tony was just telling us

37:19.933 --> 37:21.500
how Street saved
the day out there.

37:21.543 --> 37:23.980
It was no big deal, just
a lady in a tight spot.

37:24.024 --> 37:25.547
About to get fried
like a chicken.

37:25.591 --> 37:26.896
Kind of an important part.

37:26.940 --> 37:28.246
HONDO:
Well, I'm not surprised.

37:28.289 --> 37:29.725
You got one hell of
a cop riding shotgun.

37:32.728 --> 37:34.469
So you're all good?

37:34.513 --> 37:36.471
Yeah. All good.

37:36.515 --> 37:37.733
It's great riding with Tony.

37:37.777 --> 37:38.908
Sometimes he even lets me drive.

37:38.952 --> 37:40.606
Yeah, that's a mistake.

37:40.649 --> 37:43.391
[laughter]All right, look, I got to
get this boy some water.

37:43.435 --> 37:45.567
Thanks again, man.

37:45.611 --> 37:48.091
Come on.

37:48.135 --> 37:49.484
Glad to see you're doing well.

37:50.877 --> 37:52.008
Thanks-- you, too.

37:55.664 --> 37:58.101
Anyway, better get going.

37:58.145 --> 38:01.453
There's probably dishes all over
the kitchen floor and...

38:04.456 --> 38:05.892
It's great to see you guys.

38:16.903 --> 38:18.905
[phone ringing]

38:24.389 --> 38:26.347
[sighs]

38:26.391 --> 38:27.653
DEACON:
Hey, Father Ben.

38:27.696 --> 38:29.437
Thanks for getting back
to me.

38:29.481 --> 38:30.960
Yeah, family's safe, thanks.

38:31.004 --> 38:33.528
Everything good on your end?
Good, good.

38:33.572 --> 38:35.835
Hey, you remember that priest
that we were sending aid to

38:35.878 --> 38:38.272
down in Haiti back in 2010?

38:38.316 --> 38:42.189
Yeah, I need him to check on
a couple kids down there for me.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.150
Excuse me.

38:47.194 --> 38:49.544
How can I help you, Officer?That was one hell
of a day we had, huh?

38:49.588 --> 38:50.980
Think we're getting
through the thick of it.

38:51.024 --> 38:52.199
Listen, a friend of mine

38:52.242 --> 38:53.505
was in that hotel
that came down today,

38:53.548 --> 38:55.289
and I know they were sending
folks your way.

38:55.333 --> 38:57.335
I was hoping you could tell me
if she came through okay.

38:57.378 --> 38:58.988
What's her name?Nia Wells.

38:59.032 --> 39:01.513
[typing]

39:03.428 --> 39:05.038
Oh, here she is.

39:05.081 --> 39:09.825
Nia Wells, admitted with
a concussion. Room 2723.

39:09.869 --> 39:11.653
Thank you so much.

39:15.440 --> 39:17.398
ERIC:
Yeah, I was in Phoenix this
morning when I got the call.

39:17.442 --> 39:18.878
I dropped everything.

39:18.921 --> 39:20.706
NURSE:
Good news is,
she'll be just fine.

39:20.749 --> 39:22.577
How long you two
been married?

39:22.621 --> 39:24.884
ERIC:
Uh, about six years.

39:24.927 --> 39:28.017
Well, we're getting divorced,
actually.

39:28.061 --> 39:31.281
Funny how something like this
happens, and...

39:31.325 --> 39:34.763
I don't know, it changes
how you look at things.

40:00.136 --> 40:02.138
[sighs]

40:14.542 --> 40:16.544
[sighs]

40:17.763 --> 40:19.504
CHRIS:
Damn, boss.

40:19.547 --> 40:21.375
Sorry.
[scoffs]

40:21.419 --> 40:24.813
I actually thought it was
gonna be a hell of a lot worse.

40:24.857 --> 40:28.426
So, what's so important,
you were parked on my porch?

40:28.469 --> 40:29.818
It's about Street.

40:29.862 --> 40:31.864
What about him?
Funny.

40:31.907 --> 40:34.954
He's as fearless
as they come in the field,

40:34.997 --> 40:38.914
but you ask him to talk to you,
he shakes like a leaf.

40:38.958 --> 40:40.829
Street's got nothing to fear
from me.

40:42.962 --> 40:45.268
Except you're his only shot
at getting his job back.

40:45.312 --> 40:46.792
I haven't seen anything
that makes me think he wants it

40:46.835 --> 40:48.271
or that he's earned it yet.

40:48.315 --> 40:50.796
[sighs]

40:57.759 --> 40:59.805
I think Street was trying
to connect back there

40:59.848 --> 41:01.371
in the locker room, you know?

41:03.635 --> 41:06.289
I'm worried about him.

41:06.333 --> 41:08.466
I think Street's lost
without SWAT.

41:08.509 --> 41:10.293
[sighs]

41:10.337 --> 41:13.471
I'm worried about him, too.

41:13.514 --> 41:15.821
But if he wants his job back,

41:15.864 --> 41:17.779
he's gonna have to prove it
to me using more

41:17.823 --> 41:19.477
than just words.Then let him know that.

41:21.522 --> 41:24.307
That there's a chance that

41:24.351 --> 41:26.440
the door is still open,
so he can walk through it.

41:26.484 --> 41:28.921
The door was never closed.

41:28.964 --> 41:30.923
But if he wants
to earn his way back,

41:30.966 --> 41:33.012
he's gonna have to show me that
he's willing to be accountable

41:33.055 --> 41:35.231
and own his mistakes.

41:35.275 --> 41:38.321
I cannot afford to have a member
of this team

41:38.365 --> 41:41.368
who shuts down inside
and freezes me out.

41:49.942 --> 41:51.944
Chris.

41:53.293 --> 41:55.469
Sometimes this job--

41:55.513 --> 41:59.386
it closes you off and it makes
it really hard to trust people.

41:59.429 --> 42:01.823
But we hold each other's lives
out there.

42:01.867 --> 42:03.825
And that is a hell of a duty.

42:03.869 --> 42:07.742
And I need to see
that Street gets that.

42:07.786 --> 42:11.137
I can't force the man to change
until he's ready.

42:12.181 --> 42:14.183
Yeah.

42:17.491 --> 42:19.537
