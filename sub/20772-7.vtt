WEBVTT

00:01.051 --> 00:02.485
Previously, on "Casual"...

00:02.485 --> 00:03.793
I should be apologizing to you.

00:03.794 --> 00:07.691
- About what?
- Well, your sex addiction...

00:07.692 --> 00:11.195
So you had lunch with Jack and
you told him what I told you?

00:11.196 --> 00:12.988
I didn't think it was that big a deal,

00:12.989 --> 00:15.741
and then I just... it...
it just, like, slipped out.

00:17.443 --> 00:19.161
-

00:19.632 --> 00:21.399
-

00:22.027 --> 00:23.068
-

00:23.093 --> 00:24.354
I just got fired.

00:24.379 --> 00:26.014
Do you think I need protection?

00:26.039 --> 00:27.369
- Sorry.
- We're adults.

00:27.394 --> 00:28.849
Todd was your direct supervisor.

00:28.874 --> 00:30.835
He removed you from your post
and took advantage of you.

00:30.860 --> 00:32.275
All right, I guess
I'll just find somewhere else

00:32.299 --> 00:34.009
to do free work.

00:34.010 --> 00:35.177
What the fuck?

00:35.178 --> 00:36.679
I don't like it like that.

00:36.680 --> 00:38.389
Well, you didn't seem to mind before.

00:38.390 --> 00:40.724
Well, now I do.

00:40.725 --> 00:43.227
It's Leon.
I have tickets for "Rear Window"

00:43.228 --> 00:44.395
tonight at Hollywood Forever.

00:44.396 --> 00:46.063
Oh, my God,

00:46.064 --> 00:47.856
I have tickets to that.
You should totally go.

00:47.857 --> 00:49.483
You coming?

00:49.484 --> 00:50.670
No, I got plans.

00:50.671 --> 00:52.862
It was a little nerve-racking,
but we all made it through.

00:52.863 --> 00:54.446
I just feel ready.

00:54.447 --> 00:56.675
- You're ready?
- Yeah, to move forward, to move on.

00:56.700 --> 00:58.325
You found out that
your sister's your half-sister,

00:58.326 --> 01:00.371
and that she has another half-brother.

01:00.396 --> 01:02.571
I'm fine.

01:09.475 --> 01:11.275
-

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:32.610 --> 01:35.070
Yes.

01:38.450 --> 01:41.285
All right, bye. Have a good one.

01:41.286 --> 01:42.494
Stay out of trouble.

01:56.801 --> 01:59.762
Stealing office property?

01:59.763 --> 02:02.097
I prefer the term "scavenging."

02:02.098 --> 02:04.808
And it's coconut. Nobody likes coconut.

02:04.809 --> 02:06.727
Fair.

02:06.728 --> 02:09.229
You made it.

02:09.229 --> 02:11.607
An actual paycheck, how quaint.

02:11.608 --> 02:14.777
It's like we're in the '30s
but with even more demagogues.

02:14.778 --> 02:16.737
Any Friday plans?

02:16.738 --> 02:18.489
Work, you?

02:18.490 --> 02:19.990
Game night.

02:19.991 --> 02:21.158
Celebrity?

02:21.159 --> 02:24.203
"Magic: The Gathering."

02:24.204 --> 02:25.871
Have fun.

02:38.009 --> 02:40.177
I got eight volunteers confirmed.

02:40.178 --> 02:41.929
Great. Four will show up.

02:41.930 --> 02:43.555
And I finished my call list.

02:43.556 --> 02:45.182
Only got one "fuck you."

02:45.183 --> 02:48.685
Killin' it. How are you celebrating?

02:48.686 --> 02:51.188
Going to my uncle's to play a kids' game

02:51.189 --> 02:53.607
with people who are all older than me.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.150
Please come.

02:55.151 --> 02:58.529
Aw, I'm scheduled to shower.
Co-op living.

02:58.530 --> 03:00.823
We ration hot water.

03:00.824 --> 03:04.118
Well, my uncle has three showers,

03:04.119 --> 03:06.995
and he's very wasteful.

03:18.593 --> 03:20.108
-

03:21.970 --> 03:23.720
Why didn't you just say no?

03:23.721 --> 03:25.722
Uh...

03:25.723 --> 03:28.851
Because she has an infinity pool
that makes you

03:28.852 --> 03:30.727
feel both powerful...

03:30.728 --> 03:34.398
And sad at how unfair life is,
and it keeps me on my toes.

03:34.399 --> 03:36.024
I still don't see
why you have to stay there

03:36.025 --> 03:37.568
just to feed the cat.

03:37.569 --> 03:42.197
She's 39 and childless.
Joshua's not just a cat.

03:42.198 --> 03:43.490
Joshua.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.117
It's fine.

03:45.118 --> 03:47.619
Benadryl and weed brownies
will K. O. My allergies.

03:47.620 --> 03:49.413
What are you doing tonight?

03:49.414 --> 03:52.708
Uh, Alex is making us play
"Magic: The Gathering."

03:52.709 --> 03:55.085
That sounds awful. Who's coming?

03:55.086 --> 03:59.590
Laura, Alex's new roommate, Leon.

03:59.591 --> 04:01.341
- Oh.
- And I just... I haven't

04:01.342 --> 04:04.261
seen him since I blew him off,
and it's just gonna be

04:04.262 --> 04:08.765
so weird and awkward,
and he's probably gonna talk...

04:08.766 --> 04:12.603
Extra softly just to torture me a bit.

04:12.604 --> 04:17.149
All right, enjoy your drugs, Leia.

04:17.149 --> 04:19.026
Have fun.

04:22.614 --> 04:24.948
Gross! Ugh!

04:24.949 --> 04:26.705
Oh...

04:28.376 --> 04:29.668
We have a rat.

04:29.696 --> 04:31.488
What? We most certainly do not.

04:31.489 --> 04:33.407
There are droppings in my bathroom.

04:33.408 --> 04:35.909
That could be anything...
dust, dirt, delusions.

04:35.910 --> 04:37.536
We know your penchant for fantasy.

04:37.537 --> 04:39.996
Well, I know the signs.
I lived in New York.

04:39.997 --> 04:41.665
Oh, my God, you lived in New York?

04:41.666 --> 04:44.042
I never knew.
You only mention it every day.

04:44.043 --> 04:46.712
Look, this is LA, and, in LA,
we don't leave garbage

04:46.713 --> 04:48.338
on the curb like it's pre-Jesus Rome,

04:48.339 --> 04:49.881
and we don't have rats. Hey.

04:49.882 --> 04:52.592
- Hey.
- What you got?

04:52.593 --> 04:53.677
- Gruner?
- Yeah.

04:53.678 --> 04:55.470
I predicted rosé.

04:55.471 --> 05:00.308
Well, last week, I heard
these frat guys order "bro-sé,"

05:00.309 --> 05:02.140
and I'm just done.

05:02.165 --> 05:03.854
- Gross.
- How was your first week?

05:03.855 --> 05:05.355
Strangely satisfying.

05:05.356 --> 05:07.441
There are benefits working 9:00 to 5:00.

05:07.442 --> 05:09.192
Now my weekend actually has meaning.

05:09.193 --> 05:10.819
You worked 24/7 at Snooger?

05:10.820 --> 05:12.779
What? No, I mostly just hung out

05:12.780 --> 05:14.322
and caused interpersonal problems.

05:14.323 --> 05:16.366
Oh, I would've never guessed.

05:16.367 --> 05:17.701
Hi, you must be Rae.

05:17.702 --> 05:19.202
Yes, hi, nice to meet you.

05:19.203 --> 05:20.746
You're Alex's half-sister, right?

05:20.747 --> 05:23.832
Mm, is that how you describe me now?

05:23.833 --> 05:25.584
- No, no.
- Sorry, no, no, no,

05:25.585 --> 05:28.378
I meant genetically half.
You're full in spirit.

05:28.379 --> 05:31.715
Alex told me about the memorial.

05:31.716 --> 05:33.800
I can't believe your mom
blurted that out.

05:33.801 --> 05:35.886
Oh, well, you know, she's extremely

05:35.887 --> 05:38.263
- fond of attention.
- She is.

05:38.264 --> 05:39.848
And you haven't talked to her since?

05:39.849 --> 05:40.891
No.

05:40.892 --> 05:42.517
Neither of us have.

05:42.518 --> 05:44.770
Don't visit Medusa
without a sword and mirror.

05:46.439 --> 05:52.277
Okay, so... this will be
up the stairs and to the left.

05:52.278 --> 05:53.653
- Thanks.
- Hello.

05:53.654 --> 05:54.738
- Hi.
- Hi.

05:54.739 --> 05:56.616
Hi.

05:58.326 --> 05:59.493
Laura...

05:59.494 --> 06:02.454
- Hi, Mom.
- Who's that?

06:02.455 --> 06:04.331
Uh, Casey, my boss.

06:04.332 --> 06:06.082
- From petitioning.
- What?

06:06.083 --> 06:07.876
No, no, I don't do that anymore.

06:07.877 --> 06:09.920
From Verde, my environmental internship.

06:09.921 --> 06:11.421
- Oh.
- She's gonna shower,

06:11.422 --> 06:12.923
and then she'll come down and join us.

06:12.924 --> 06:15.008
Shower?

06:15.009 --> 06:18.178
I don't remember you mentioning Casey.

06:18.179 --> 06:20.598
You didn't ask.

06:27.230 --> 06:29.105
Now I know how King Tut feels.

06:29.106 --> 06:31.274
My sanctuary's been desecrated.

06:31.275 --> 06:32.776
How did it even get in?

06:32.777 --> 06:34.110
Probably through the toilet.

06:34.111 --> 06:35.487
They can do that?

06:35.488 --> 06:36.863
It's more like what they can't do.

06:36.864 --> 06:38.406
They can collapse their rib cages.

06:38.407 --> 06:39.825
Hold their breath for three minutes.

06:39.826 --> 06:41.201
Tread water for days.

06:41.202 --> 06:42.494
They're everywhere and nowhere.

06:42.495 --> 06:43.912
Like Russian hackers.

06:43.913 --> 06:45.622
How do you know so much about rats?

06:45.623 --> 06:47.749
Oh, we thought we had
an infestation at Verde.

06:47.750 --> 06:51.002
Turns out it was just a rabid bat.

06:51.003 --> 06:53.296
Well, Rae, thanks a lot.

06:53.297 --> 06:54.839
- Excuse me?
- Well, do the math.

06:54.840 --> 06:57.008
Before you, no rat. After you, rat.

06:57.009 --> 06:58.885
So you obviously brought it
from New York.

06:58.886 --> 07:00.804
Right, yeah, yeah, yeah,
it must have climbed aboard

07:00.805 --> 07:02.973
my luggage when the steam ship set off.

07:02.974 --> 07:05.350
Sure, or a train.
I've seen "Fievel Goes West."

07:05.351 --> 07:07.102
- Fievel's a mouse.
- Okay, you know what?

07:07.103 --> 07:09.229
It's your house, your rat.
You want it out?

07:09.230 --> 07:11.356
- Call someone.
- And quick.

07:11.357 --> 07:14.235
Where's there's one rat, there's 20.

07:18.616 --> 07:20.116
$1,000?

07:20.183 --> 07:22.685
I can literally have
a person killed for that.

07:23.661 --> 07:25.370
No, that's not a threat.

07:25.371 --> 07:26.913
It's a fact said threateningly.

07:28.833 --> 07:30.250
Fucking extortionist.

07:30.251 --> 07:31.918
Preying on the fearful... Who does that?

07:31.919 --> 07:35.213
Politicians, priests,
every villain ever.

07:35.214 --> 07:37.007
I'm worried about Laura.

07:37.008 --> 07:38.717
- Why?
- 'Cause she's secretly

07:38.718 --> 07:40.844
interning for a woman
she brought here to shower.

07:40.845 --> 07:43.013
On a scale of one to Lewinsky,

07:43.014 --> 07:44.723
that feels like a five, at least.

07:44.724 --> 07:46.474
- Val...
- What?

07:46.475 --> 07:49.394
Your only daughter is trying
to make a better world.

07:49.395 --> 07:52.314
This is what parents dream of, okay?

07:52.315 --> 07:55.692
As the revered poet McFerrin once said,

07:55.693 --> 07:58.237
"Don't worry, be happy."

08:02.116 --> 08:03.950
When is the exterminator coming?

08:03.951 --> 08:06.202
He can't come till Thursday.

08:06.203 --> 08:08.038
We'll set the traps ourselves.

08:08.039 --> 08:10.290
I hope it doesn't turn into a rat king.

08:10.291 --> 08:11.541
What's a rat king?

08:11.542 --> 08:13.335
Is that like "The Nutcracker"?

08:13.336 --> 08:15.045
When rats are in confined places

08:15.046 --> 08:17.464
and their tails get intertwined,
they move as one,

08:17.465 --> 08:19.883
a roving tumbleweed
of disease-ridden rodents.

08:19.884 --> 08:23.053
That is not real. That can't be real.

08:23.054 --> 08:24.220
Oh!

08:24.221 --> 08:27.265
- It's real?
- Yep, ugh.

08:27.404 --> 08:30.572
Evening, Gatherers.
Let the magic commence...

08:30.597 --> 08:32.577
Cheese? Whose side are you on, Leon?

08:32.616 --> 08:33.547
It's real.

08:33.572 --> 08:34.606
- Yeah.
- Wait.

08:34.607 --> 08:36.900
- What are we searching?
- Stop googling the rat king.

08:36.900 --> 08:38.275
Ah, like "The Nutcracker."

08:38.277 --> 08:41.029
Okay, we can't live like this.

08:41.030 --> 08:42.447
- Valerie.
- Leon.

08:42.448 --> 08:44.407
Call back the exterminator. Beg.

08:44.408 --> 08:50.121
No, no, we are man,
top of the food chain.

08:50.122 --> 08:52.707
We're the apex predator
through wits alone.

08:52.708 --> 08:54.793
We don't bow to nature.

08:54.794 --> 08:56.711
No, we bend nature to our will.

08:56.712 --> 09:00.590
So let's cast off
these chains of modernity

09:00.591 --> 09:02.759
and kill this rat.

09:11.727 --> 09:13.437
Hmm.

09:16.148 --> 09:19.693
They like beer, peanut butter,
slim jims...

09:19.694 --> 09:21.486
Rats: They're just like us.

09:21.487 --> 09:23.446
They're also thigmophilic.

09:23.447 --> 09:25.949
- What does that mean?
- "Touch-loving."

09:25.950 --> 09:27.659
- Aww.
- Yeah.

09:27.660 --> 09:31.204
Hello? Yeah.

09:31.205 --> 09:33.456
We could always get cage traps and then

09:33.457 --> 09:35.709
set him free in a nice field.

09:35.710 --> 09:37.627
Leon, I'm not running a rat taxi.

09:37.628 --> 09:38.837
It'll just come back anyway.

09:38.838 --> 09:40.130
Rats never forget a route in.

09:40.131 --> 09:41.673
And poison won't work either.

09:41.674 --> 09:43.675
They taste check their food
more than Castro.

09:43.676 --> 09:45.343
Rest in peace.

09:45.344 --> 09:47.846
You should probably
just burn your house down now

09:47.847 --> 09:49.639
and collect the insurance money
while you can.

09:49.640 --> 09:51.266
You weren't hugged as a child, were you?

09:51.267 --> 09:53.936
Okay, Jack is bringing traps.

09:54.729 --> 09:57.355
- Cage traps?
- Death traps.

10:08.743 --> 10:11.828
- So Jack?
- That's his name.

10:11.829 --> 10:14.622
I wish I'd known.
I would've fired up the egg.

10:14.623 --> 10:15.999
Fire up an egg.

10:16.000 --> 10:17.375
Yeah, it doesn't work like that.

10:17.376 --> 10:19.002
Why wasn't I debriefed?

10:19.003 --> 10:20.837
'Cause we're friends.
There's nothing to brief.

10:20.838 --> 10:23.423
I still think it's weird.
Why didn't you tell us?

10:23.424 --> 10:24.717
You didn't ask.

10:25.676 --> 10:27.385
You didn't want to bring
your girlfriend?

10:27.386 --> 10:30.389
Well, I'm not sure
she is my girlfriend yet.

10:33.392 --> 10:34.976
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

10:34.977 --> 10:37.687
The only way to survive in this house.

10:37.688 --> 10:39.814
I'm not a huge fan of wine.

10:39.815 --> 10:41.483
Gives me bitching headaches.

10:41.484 --> 10:43.568
Only if you stop.

10:43.569 --> 10:49.199
So Verde... what is it
you all do over there?

10:49.200 --> 10:51.201
Well, we work with communities impacted

10:51.202 --> 10:53.870
by fracking and oil wells,
and, on a macro level,

10:53.871 --> 10:55.747
all people affected by climate change.

10:55.748 --> 10:58.625
- So everyone?
- Whoever's willing to listen.

10:58.626 --> 11:04.672
And do you have a lot
of volunteers in high school?

11:04.673 --> 11:08.176
Just Laura, but honestly,
I forget sometimes.

11:08.177 --> 11:09.636
She fits in so well.

11:09.637 --> 11:11.888
Well, she always has.

11:11.889 --> 11:15.517
Now why is it you don't pay
your full-time volunteers?

11:15.518 --> 11:18.561
Well, if we got paid,
we wouldn't be volunteers,

11:18.562 --> 11:20.355
- would we?
- Hmm.

11:20.356 --> 11:23.358
90% of our resources funnel
back into the organization.

11:23.359 --> 11:24.859
I barely take a salary myself.

11:24.860 --> 11:27.612
Wow, that sounds like a very hard life.

11:27.613 --> 11:31.407
Sometimes, but if you want to
create real change,

11:31.408 --> 11:34.285
then you gotta do more
than drive a Prius.

11:40.584 --> 11:42.836
- Hey.
- Oh, finally, a witness.

11:42.837 --> 11:44.587
You see that deception on display?

11:44.588 --> 11:47.006
- Okay, "Crucible."
- Val just lied to my face.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.716
- We don't do that.
- Except you lied to her,

11:48.717 --> 11:50.844
like, an hour ago about your mom.

11:50.869 --> 11:52.488
It's... erroneous.

11:52.513 --> 11:54.264
Now you're lying about lying.

11:54.265 --> 11:56.641
Haven't you done enough?
First you defile my house,

11:56.642 --> 11:58.184
then you make wild accusations.

11:58.185 --> 11:59.894
- Who's on a witch hunt now?
- You know what?

11:59.895 --> 12:01.771
For the last time,
I did not bring rats into...

12:02.982 --> 12:05.817
You brought rats.

12:05.818 --> 12:07.694
Here's Johnny!

12:07.695 --> 12:09.822
Jesus.

12:10.614 --> 12:13.616
What... Wow. Quite the arsenal.

12:13.617 --> 12:15.952
Yeah, yeah, I took it kind of seriously.

12:15.953 --> 12:17.745
Is there more?
There is, actually, but we...

12:17.746 --> 12:19.581
Is that a bag of weapons?

12:19.582 --> 12:21.374
Even Stevie could kill
with this arsenal.

12:21.375 --> 12:23.042
You're the sunshine of my life.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.461
Well, this doesn't
seem like a fair fight.

12:25.462 --> 12:26.921
We are under siege.

12:26.922 --> 12:28.506
Is it not fair to protect one's keep

12:28.507 --> 12:30.800
from an invading barbarian horde?

12:30.801 --> 12:32.802
No, I just wish there was
a more natural way.

12:32.803 --> 12:34.387
What about a cat?

12:34.388 --> 12:36.389
In New York,
bodegas keep cats to hunt rats.

12:36.390 --> 12:38.391
Yes, only in New York
do people keep cats

12:38.392 --> 12:40.143
to hunt rats 'cause that's not

12:40.144 --> 12:42.103
a mainstay of human history or anything.

12:42.104 --> 12:43.897
Of course, we don't have a cat.

12:43.898 --> 12:45.481
We have a bag of weapons.

12:45.482 --> 12:48.611
Leia has a cat.

12:52.489 --> 12:54.115
Hi.

12:54.116 --> 12:56.326
Are you okay?

12:56.327 --> 12:57.744
Yeah, no, I'm great.

12:57.745 --> 12:59.287
Jesus, what happened to your neck?

12:59.288 --> 13:01.956
Oh, this little fucker's vicious.

13:01.957 --> 13:04.792
Also he does not like to be cuddled.

13:04.793 --> 13:06.669
Perfect.

13:08.964 --> 13:12.133
"You're about to embark
upon the Great Crusade.

13:12.134 --> 13:14.969
"The eyes of the world are upon you.

13:14.970 --> 13:16.971
"The hopes and prayers
of a liberty-loving people

13:16.972 --> 13:19.124
everywhere march in communities..."

13:19.149 --> 13:21.451
- Eisenhower's D-Day speech.
- Yes, it just came to me.

13:21.476 --> 13:22.591
I love when that happens.

13:22.616 --> 13:24.687
The other day, I pulled
Tom Skerritt's "Top Gun" speech.

13:24.688 --> 13:25.688
Oh.

13:25.689 --> 13:27.398
"Gentlemen you are

13:27.399 --> 13:30.818
the top 1% of all naval aviators..."

13:30.819 --> 13:34.322
- Alex.
- Right, sorry.

13:37.576 --> 13:40.788
Joshua, it's your time now.

13:41.789 --> 13:46.250
He can be a little shy.

13:46.251 --> 13:48.544
♪ We're looking for the rat king ♪

13:48.545 --> 13:50.672
♪ Rat king, rat king ♪

13:50.673 --> 13:52.840
♪ We're looking for
our problems to go... ♪

13:52.841 --> 13:54.717
Uh, yeah, no, you're making it worse.

13:54.718 --> 13:56.219
Yeah, that's dumb.

13:56.220 --> 13:58.638
You really don't wanna find your dad?

13:58.639 --> 14:00.348
Sorry, I hope that's not too intrusive.

14:00.349 --> 14:02.600
No, it's fine.

14:02.601 --> 14:04.310
Yeah, I just feel like I'm 40.

14:04.311 --> 14:06.461
I don't need to deliberately
add pain to my life.

14:06.486 --> 14:07.502
No, I get that.

14:07.527 --> 14:08.982
I don't know. I'm just saying

14:08.983 --> 14:10.566
finding my dad was really illuminating.

14:10.567 --> 14:11.859
Come on.

14:11.860 --> 14:13.236
- You found your dad?
- Yeah.

14:13.237 --> 14:15.279
Dad, sperm donor, protein source.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.532
No, don't get me wrong, I never
felt lacking with my mom,

14:17.533 --> 14:19.826
but something about seeing my nose

14:19.827 --> 14:23.079
on another person's face gave me peace.

14:23.080 --> 14:24.831
Yeah. Also, I found out

14:24.832 --> 14:25.873
I have nine half-siblings.

14:25.874 --> 14:27.650
- Whoa.
- Yeah, that's 18 kidneys.

14:27.675 --> 14:30.657
Okay, new plan, um,

14:30.754 --> 14:32.588
let's pair up and pick rooms.

14:32.589 --> 14:34.424
The rat's not gonna come where we are,

14:34.425 --> 14:37.760
and we need to give the cat
room to do its thing.

14:37.761 --> 14:38.886
So now.

14:38.887 --> 14:40.848
All right, lock and load.

14:45.644 --> 14:48.312
Smooth, real smooth.

14:48.313 --> 14:50.231
Here's a thought...

14:50.232 --> 14:52.859
Ever consider I might be protective?

14:52.860 --> 14:54.444
That maybe I don't want my sister having

14:54.445 --> 14:56.654
an emotional conversation
with a stranger

14:56.655 --> 14:58.031
who brought rats?

14:58.032 --> 14:59.615
Yeah, nice try. What are you hiding?

14:59.616 --> 15:01.117
I'm not hiding anything.

15:01.118 --> 15:03.327
Okay, cool, I'm gonna go
find your sister

15:03.328 --> 15:06.122
and finish our conversation.

15:06.123 --> 15:07.791
- Fine.
- Great.

15:09.084 --> 15:11.295
Fuck, stop.

15:17.134 --> 15:20.553
Ah, playing possum to lure
the rat onto the bed.

15:20.554 --> 15:23.473
- That's a good technique.
- Yeah.

15:24.558 --> 15:26.268
You got me.

15:31.065 --> 15:36.194
You know it's okay
to be not okay, right?

15:36.195 --> 15:39.322
Took me a year to feel like myself again

15:39.323 --> 15:40.406
after my dad passed.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.825
Oh, no, it's not that.

15:42.826 --> 15:46.245
The strange thing is knowing
the full story just feels like

15:46.246 --> 15:48.748
a weight's been lifted
that I didn't even know I had.

15:48.749 --> 15:53.753
I always felt like something was
off with us, and now I know why.

15:53.754 --> 15:56.047
No, it's Laura that I'm worried about.

15:56.048 --> 15:57.507
What's going on?

15:57.508 --> 16:01.511
Well, she's... she's volunteering.

16:01.512 --> 16:03.012
No.

16:03.013 --> 16:06.390
I don't know.

16:06.391 --> 16:08.768
I just... I don't trust it.

16:08.769 --> 16:13.022
I... I... I don't know what
this Casey wants with Laura,

16:13.023 --> 16:17.778
and I don't know
what Laura wants with her.

16:20.572 --> 16:22.865
Do I sound crazy?

16:22.866 --> 16:25.201
You're a mother.

16:25.202 --> 16:27.538
Trust your instincts.

16:30.165 --> 16:32.375
Is this okay?

16:32.376 --> 16:35.378
Yeah, it's okay.

16:47.808 --> 16:50.143
Sorry about the interrogation.

16:50.144 --> 16:51.644
All good.

16:51.645 --> 16:53.271
You think your mom's
the first to question

16:53.272 --> 16:56.232
- my choices?
- Still.

16:56.233 --> 16:58.985
I get it. I mean, you're her daughter.

16:58.986 --> 17:00.903
She sees you as a kid.

17:00.904 --> 17:03.030
She doesn't see you like I do.

17:03.031 --> 17:05.367
Or know what we're trying to do.

17:07.411 --> 17:09.787
♪ We're looking for
the rat king, the rat king ♪

17:09.788 --> 17:12.790
- ♪ The rat king... ♪
- Stop.

17:12.790 --> 17:16.919
- Are you...?
- What?

17:16.920 --> 17:18.421
I said, are you upset?

17:18.422 --> 17:19.630
If you just had feelings for her,

17:19.631 --> 17:21.758
you should have told me.

17:22.759 --> 17:24.510
Who, Valerie?

17:24.511 --> 17:26.596
I mean, you didn't tell me
about tonight for a reason,

17:26.597 --> 17:30.099
and I am so stoned I feel like
Matt Damon in "The Martian,"

17:30.100 --> 17:33.060
except no one's gonna catch me,
and I'm just gonna float away

17:33.061 --> 17:37.899
into the void of space,
but I still know that

17:37.900 --> 17:41.778
I can't be your second choice.

17:42.779 --> 17:45.281
I don't have feelings for Valerie.

17:45.282 --> 17:48.284
Then why didn't you
tell me about tonight?

17:48.285 --> 17:54.458
I've ruined relationships
by being overbearing...

17:55.417 --> 18:00.296
And I... I couldn't forgive myself
if I did it with you.

18:00.297 --> 18:02.423
You could never be

18:02.424 --> 18:05.927
anyone's second choice.

18:05.928 --> 18:08.804
I just wasn't sure
if I could be your first choice.

18:08.805 --> 18:10.723
But you could.

18:10.724 --> 18:13.352
I mean, you are.

18:27.658 --> 18:32.912
No more hiding. Let's tell them tonight.

18:36.917 --> 18:39.752
I don't know why I went back.

18:39.753 --> 18:42.755
Something drew me in.

18:42.756 --> 18:46.050
Maybe it feels powerful
to be polarizing.

18:46.051 --> 18:47.385
I don't know.

18:47.386 --> 18:49.804
I should have just fucking told Val.

18:49.805 --> 18:53.599
- Alex...
- I know, I know.

18:53.600 --> 18:56.561
You are shouldering too much weight.

18:56.562 --> 18:58.312
I don't think so.

18:58.313 --> 19:01.774
Your mom gave you information
that you didn't want.

19:01.775 --> 19:03.734
She did it to hurt you.

19:03.735 --> 19:05.528
Yeah, and I let her.

19:05.529 --> 19:07.446
Well, you can't control your parents.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.699
You can't cure them.

19:09.700 --> 19:11.701
Just tell Val.

19:11.702 --> 19:13.370
She'll understand.

19:15.664 --> 19:17.540
How do you know when I'm lying?

19:17.541 --> 19:20.293
You have a tell.
You do it when we play "Magic."

19:20.294 --> 19:23.337
- I do not.
- Mm.

19:23.338 --> 19:26.049
I'll forgive you for the rat.

19:31.722 --> 19:33.764
Where were you the night
that I showed up at your hotel

19:33.765 --> 19:35.726
and you were gone?

19:39.104 --> 19:43.065
- Vegas.
- Okay.

19:43.066 --> 19:45.067
A buddy of mine had a bad breakup,

19:45.068 --> 19:48.113
and I felt like I couldn't say no.

19:50.115 --> 19:51.657
It started out okay.

19:51.658 --> 19:55.662
A few hours at the strip club
the first night.

19:57.331 --> 20:00.750
A few more the second night,
and then, uh, one morning,

20:00.751 --> 20:04.086
I woke up, and my hotel room
was trashed.

20:04.087 --> 20:06.088
There was a woman to the left of me,

20:06.089 --> 20:09.508
and a man to the right
that I swear to God

20:09.509 --> 20:13.220
was about 400 pounds.

20:13.221 --> 20:16.308
And she said that I owed her $10,000.

20:18.101 --> 20:20.896
$10,000? For what?

20:22.356 --> 20:25.608
Do not know. Don't remember.

20:25.609 --> 20:28.695
So then I just paid her,
and they let me go.

20:30.822 --> 20:33.449
It was low.

20:33.450 --> 20:35.451
I was ashamed.

20:35.452 --> 20:38.871
Then I came back. You were there.

20:38.872 --> 20:42.334
And it was great. We were us.

20:44.795 --> 20:45.961
Yeah.

20:45.962 --> 20:48.798
I miss us.

20:48.799 --> 20:50.758
- Hmm.
- I wish I had

20:50.759 --> 20:52.635
an easier answer for you,
and I know that

20:52.636 --> 20:57.265
with my celibacy that I couldn't
ask you to try again, but...

20:58.225 --> 21:02.436
- But?
- I want to try again.

21:07.317 --> 21:08.734
It's taunting me.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.528
To be fair, you're trying to kill it.

21:10.529 --> 21:12.154
'Cause it broke the social contract.

21:12.155 --> 21:13.406
It came inside.

21:13.407 --> 21:14.990
In New York, they understand.

21:14.991 --> 21:16.826
Tracks are for them.
The platforms are for us.

21:16.827 --> 21:21.872
Uh, I think nature took its course.

21:21.873 --> 21:23.999
- Oh!
- Ew!

21:24.000 --> 21:25.668
Oh, my God.

21:25.669 --> 21:28.838
Ah, proud of you, buddy.

21:28.839 --> 21:32.175
With death, we celebrate life.

21:36.042 --> 21:38.322
"Gentlemen, this school is
about combat..."

21:38.347 --> 21:40.383
"There are no points
for second place..."

21:40.809 --> 21:44.019
"Dismissed."

21:44.020 --> 21:45.688
Hey, when do you think they'll start

21:45.689 --> 21:48.357
playing beach volleyball, huh?

21:48.358 --> 21:50.276
- Okay, color combinations...
- Hold on, one second.

21:50.277 --> 21:54.280
Are really important, so you
need to pick a style that

21:54.281 --> 21:55.990
best reflects your personality, right?

21:55.991 --> 21:58.367
Oh, sorry, so you need
red and blue and white,

21:58.368 --> 22:01.245
and you might be blue because, you know,

22:01.246 --> 22:02.621
- because you're confident.
- Well...

22:02.622 --> 22:03.622
Right?

22:06.752 --> 22:08.878
- Hey.
- Hey.

22:08.879 --> 22:12.214
You guys seem really close,
you and Casey.

22:12.215 --> 22:13.883
Yeah, I guess so.

22:13.884 --> 22:15.926
Something going on with you two?

22:15.927 --> 22:17.928
What do you mean?

22:17.929 --> 22:21.807
You know, you have a pattern.

22:21.808 --> 22:24.477
What pattern?

22:24.478 --> 22:29.565
Michael, Aubrey, you know,
the tendency to sort of

22:29.566 --> 22:33.986
complicate relationships with sex.

22:33.987 --> 22:39.033
Wow, it's so sad
that's what you think of me.

22:39.034 --> 22:41.368
Well, Laura...

22:47.417 --> 22:49.127
Okay.

22:52.214 --> 22:55.090
I think I've overfilled my family quota.

22:55.091 --> 22:56.133
Vacate?

22:56.134 --> 22:57.551
Definitely.

22:57.552 --> 22:59.011
Uh, I'm due at my girlfriend's.

22:59.012 --> 23:00.805
She's threatening to go full Ophelia.

23:00.806 --> 23:03.599
So if you wanna go, I'll take you home?

23:03.600 --> 23:06.311
Thanks, yeah, that'd be great.

23:09.856 --> 23:11.857
- Later.
- Thanks for the shower.

23:11.858 --> 23:13.651
- Oh, bye, sure, anytime.
- Bye.

23:13.652 --> 23:15.277
We're gathering for the Magic.

23:15.278 --> 23:17.322
- Bye!
- All right, let's go.

23:20.325 --> 23:24.495
- So Laura's leaving?
- Shit, yeah, I guess so.

23:24.496 --> 23:25.955
She didn't tell you?

23:25.956 --> 23:27.957
It seems to be her M. O. These days.

23:27.958 --> 23:33.045
Yeah, speaking of, um,
remember my dress shoes?

23:33.046 --> 23:36.590
From Dad's memorial?
Um, I couldn't just abandon them

23:36.591 --> 23:41.136
at Mom's, so after
we released Dad, or whatever,

23:41.137 --> 23:44.139
I went back to save them and Mom told me

23:44.140 --> 23:45.934
you have a half-brother.

23:49.312 --> 23:50.938
It's crazy, right?

23:50.939 --> 23:57.778
Uh, uh-huh, yeah,
it's really... that's crazy.

23:57.779 --> 24:03.450
Yeah, so, thought you should know.

24:03.451 --> 24:05.911
Thanks for telling me.

24:05.912 --> 24:08.539
All right, guys, should we play?

24:08.540 --> 24:11.166
Absolutely, come on.

24:15.547 --> 24:18.674
Got to cut this album.

24:18.675 --> 24:19.884
All right, "Magic" time.

24:19.885 --> 24:21.635
Oh, yeah, the Gathering time.

24:21.636 --> 24:23.387
Jack's gonna be
frustratingly good at this.

24:23.388 --> 24:24.972
Did I get beginner cards or something?

24:24.973 --> 24:26.473
No, I gave you the new deck.

24:26.474 --> 24:27.850
- Yeah, yeah.
- No, I believe you.

24:29.519 --> 24:33.689
Uh, before we start,
I'd just like to say that...

24:33.690 --> 24:37.860
I have to take
a rain check on this game.

24:37.861 --> 24:41.155
I've had a really long week,
and I'm so tired.

24:41.156 --> 24:43.657
- You need a ride?
- Uh, yeah, that'd be great.

24:43.658 --> 24:45.409
- Bye.
- Oh, no.

24:45.410 --> 24:48.037
No, no, it's okay...
you can play another time.

24:48.038 --> 24:50.664
- Really?
- I think I should call it too.

24:50.665 --> 24:52.541
- Oh.
- Oh, same.

24:52.542 --> 24:54.710
- I gotta get Joshua.
- Please, we haven't even

24:54.711 --> 24:56.879
played one game yet.

24:56.880 --> 24:59.548
Ah, we gotta celebrate man's victory.

24:59.549 --> 25:01.550
To triumph and human spirit!

25:01.551 --> 25:03.886
All right, bud, next time.

25:03.887 --> 25:06.430
- All right, this was fun.
- Bye.

25:06.431 --> 25:10.100
- Yeah.
- Bye.

25:10.101 --> 25:12.896
- Okay.
- Oh, sorry.

25:22.405 --> 25:24.949
When I was a kid,
I wanted to study earthquakes

25:24.950 --> 25:28.118
because I was so terrified
of when the big one would hit.

25:28.119 --> 25:29.703
I felt like if I could predict it,

25:29.704 --> 25:32.748
then I would feel so much safer.

25:32.749 --> 25:37.670
Even the best seismologist
can't predict it.

25:37.671 --> 25:41.423
Like, they can't,
they just... they can't.

25:41.424 --> 25:42.925
We have no control.

25:42.926 --> 25:46.262
We are as clueless
as the people of Pompeii.

25:48.640 --> 25:51.267
I mean, at least they died quick.

25:59.234 --> 26:01.860
I wanna try.

26:01.861 --> 26:05.114
Without the sex.

26:05.115 --> 26:06.490
You sure?

26:06.491 --> 26:09.618
Mm-hmm, I can wait.

26:09.619 --> 26:11.912
And I miss us too.

26:23.133 --> 26:25.718
So did you, uh,

26:25.719 --> 26:27.136
did you talk to Val?

26:27.137 --> 26:30.139
- Mm-hmm.
- And?

26:30.140 --> 26:32.057
What, weight lifted or...

26:32.058 --> 26:33.809
Well, no, not exactly.

26:33.810 --> 26:36.103
Really? Man, I thought she seemed

26:36.104 --> 26:39.064
pretty happy when she left.

26:39.065 --> 26:42.027
She has a tell too.

26:44.237 --> 26:45.488
Fuck.
