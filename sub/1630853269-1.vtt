02:08.480 --> 02:10.560
Hello?!

02:12.840 --> 02:14.840
Is someone there?

02:18.040 --> 02:20.040
I need help!

03:55.200 --> 03:57.880
there's no better days

04:01.840 --> 04:04.880
until I'm scared of day

04:25.880 --> 04:27.880
Rebel, fetch.

04:34.200 --> 04:36.720
New painting?
I need a distraction.

04:36.760 --> 04:38.000
Yeah.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.000
You were tossing and turning
all night.

04:40.000 --> 04:40.360
You were tossing and turning
all night.

04:41.920 --> 04:44.160
Neve will be fine.
It'll blow over.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.560
What's it gonna be?

04:47.600 --> 04:48.000
I don't know yet.
It'll tell me - eventually.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.800
I don't know yet.
It'll tell me - eventually.

04:51.360 --> 04:53.560
I'm still waiting for my big moment.

04:53.600 --> 04:56.000
You won't let me paint you nude.
Damn right.

04:56.000 --> 04:56.640
You won't let me paint you nude.
Damn right.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.680
Give me something to work with.

05:00.560 --> 05:02.120
Go on.

05:02.160 --> 05:04.000
Do something surprising.

05:04.000 --> 05:04.320
Do something surprising.

05:09.880 --> 05:12.000
Ohh! Prick!

05:12.000 --> 05:13.000
Ohh! Prick!

05:13.400 --> 05:15.840
You'd better sleep
with one eye open from now on.

05:15.880 --> 05:18.080
Oh, yeah.
And you're cooking breakfast.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.000
Fair play.

05:20.000 --> 05:20.120
Fair play.

05:25.320 --> 05:27.120
Uh. No eggs.
Well.

05:27.160 --> 05:28.000
Something's spooked them.
Pull yourselves together, girls.

05:28.000 --> 05:30.920
Something's spooked them.
Pull yourselves together, girls.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.440
Doesn't look like a fox.

05:33.480 --> 05:36.000
I'll check the cams.
Ha. God forbid they come in useful!

05:36.000 --> 05:36.520
I'll check the cams.
Ha. God forbid they come in useful!

05:47.800 --> 05:49.760
Come on. I'm starving.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.760
Come on.

06:09.200 --> 06:11.600
Get out of my room.

06:11.640 --> 06:14.160
It stinks in here.
How much did you drink last night?

06:14.200 --> 06:15.760
Too much.

06:15.800 --> 06:16.000
Make the sun go away.

06:16.000 --> 06:18.600
Make the sun go away.

06:18.640 --> 06:20.360
Check this out.

06:20.400 --> 06:22.280
Katie, look.

06:22.320 --> 06:24.000
Oh, what the fuck, Max?!

06:24.000 --> 06:24.360
Oh, what the fuck, Max?!

06:24.400 --> 06:26.880
It's dead.
Yeah, so get it out of my face.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.320
It fell out the sky.
Landed on my window.

06:29.360 --> 06:32.000
Get out of my room, you weirdo.
Shove it in Neve's face.

06:32.000 --> 06:32.960
Get out of my room, you weirdo.
Shove it in Neve's face.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.960
"Hello, Katie."
Out!

06:37.560 --> 06:39.160
Freak.

06:42.560 --> 06:44.440
Neve?

06:46.440 --> 06:48.000
Ah. Good. You're up.
Your dad's cooking breakfast.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.280
Ah. Good. You're up.
Your dad's cooking breakfast.

06:50.120 --> 06:53.360
Max, what are you doing?
It dropped on my window.

06:53.400 --> 06:55.080
Well, take it outside.

06:55.120 --> 06:56.000
Uh, I was gonna show Neve.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.040
Uh, I was gonna show Neve.

06:57.080 --> 06:58.800
Where is she?
Don't know.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.760
Probably still at the party.

07:07.160 --> 07:09.040
Neve?

07:11.840 --> 07:12.000
Did you see Neve
leave the house this morning?

07:12.000 --> 07:14.160
Did you see Neve
leave the house this morning?

07:14.200 --> 07:16.920
She wouldn't be up this early.
I thought we had bacon.

07:16.960 --> 07:18.840
No. I don't think so.

07:56.920 --> 07:58.400
Neve!

08:00.320 --> 08:01.560
Neve!

08:28.600 --> 08:30.160
What?

08:30.200 --> 08:32.000
Katie, where's Neve?
I'm asleep.

08:32.000 --> 08:32.080
Katie, where's Neve?
I'm asleep.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.040
Where is she, though?

08:34.080 --> 08:35.640
How would I know?

08:35.680 --> 08:38.320
Well, didn't you come home together?

08:39.960 --> 08:40.000
Katie, you know the rules.
You come home together.

08:40.000 --> 08:42.440
Katie, you know the rules.
You come home together.

08:42.480 --> 08:45.080
Don't blame me. She's your daughter.

08:48.880 --> 08:52.760
'Hey, this is Joe. Don't leave
a message, just text me.'

08:52.800 --> 08:54.600
No. Joe's phone's
going to voicemail.

08:54.640 --> 08:56.000
Oh. She'll turn up.
That's not the point.

08:56.000 --> 08:56.800
Oh. She'll turn up.
That's not the point.

08:56.840 --> 08:59.040
Step-sisters should
look out for each other.

08:59.080 --> 09:01.120
Ugh. Dad, chill.
When did you last see her?

09:01.160 --> 09:04.000
Not late. She'd had a few drinks.
Thought she'd gone to sleep it off.

09:04.000 --> 09:04.120
Not late. She'd had a few drinks.
Thought she'd gone to sleep it off.

09:04.160 --> 09:06.440
You didn't think to check?
Why? Her dad was there.

09:06.480 --> 09:08.840
Yeah. Of course.
Getting hammered with teenagers!

09:08.880 --> 09:10.080
Dan.
Right. Hang on.

09:10.120 --> 09:12.000
I've got her phone saved
on my tracking app.

09:12.000 --> 09:12.240
I've got her phone saved
on my tracking app.

09:12.280 --> 09:14.200
Stalker.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.440
She's still down there. All right?

09:17.480 --> 09:20.000
Probably crashed in someone's tent.
All right. I'll go find her.

09:20.000 --> 09:20.480
Probably crashed in someone's tent.
All right. I'll go find her.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.360
Thanks.
What's that app called?

09:22.400 --> 09:25.080
I'll add you onto our group.
But only for today.

09:27.440 --> 09:28.000
Come on, Rebel.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.440
Come on, Rebel.

09:30.680 --> 09:32.520
Can someone make pancakes?

09:57.960 --> 09:59.840
Nicky?

09:59.880 --> 10:00.000
Hey.
Seen Neve?

10:00.000 --> 10:02.000
Hey.
Seen Neve?

10:02.040 --> 10:03.560
Not since last night.

10:04.320 --> 10:07.400
I think she needed a blow-out
after the race.

10:07.440 --> 10:08.000
Everything OK?
Yeah.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.840
Everything OK?
Yeah.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.640
Here somewhere.

11:01.560 --> 11:04.000
Is she there?
'I've found her phone.'

11:04.000 --> 11:04.440
Is she there?
'I've found her phone.'

11:05.680 --> 11:07.200
So, where's Neve?

11:08.080 --> 11:10.080
There's no sign of her.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.560
What do you mean?

11:11.600 --> 11:12.000
'Her phone was on the ground,
by the woods.'

11:12.000 --> 11:14.080
'Her phone was on the ground,
by the woods.'

11:16.240 --> 11:18.640
She's glued to that phone.
'I know.'

11:19.360 --> 11:20.000
She might've just had
a bit to drink and dropped it.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.040
She might've just had
a bit to drink and dropped it.

11:22.080 --> 11:23.760
Or maybe she crashed at her dad's.'

11:23.800 --> 11:25.440
She wouldn't do that.

11:25.480 --> 11:27.240
Not even to spite me.

11:27.880 --> 11:28.000
I'll keep looking. There's people
here who might've seen her.

11:28.000 --> 11:31.080
I'll keep looking. There's people
here who might've seen her.

11:31.120 --> 11:32.480
OK.

11:33.440 --> 11:35.800
I'll call Tom, just in case.

11:35.840 --> 11:36.000
'All right. I'm gonna ask around.'

11:36.000 --> 11:37.840
'All right. I'm gonna ask around.'

12:08.520 --> 12:09.640
Mum.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.800
Can you call me back
when you get this?

12:13.840 --> 12:15.920
I'm hoping Neve is with you.
Mum.

12:15.960 --> 12:16.000
Just call or text me.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.560
Just call or text me.

12:17.600 --> 12:20.240
I had the weirdest morning.
I can't remember anything.

12:20.280 --> 12:22.440
It's...
It's like I woke up in the lake.

12:22.480 --> 12:24.000
I was soaking wet.

12:24.000 --> 12:24.200
I was soaking wet.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.320
I'm sorry I didn't call.
I lost my phone.

12:30.360 --> 12:32.000
I've been so freaked out.

12:32.000 --> 12:32.160
I've been so freaked out.

12:33.440 --> 12:35.680
'Which service, please?'
Police.

12:35.720 --> 12:37.320
Mum, don't be mad.

12:37.360 --> 12:39.000
Yes, my daughter hasn't come home.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.000
OK, so we're doing this, are we?
Name's Neve Kelly.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.680
OK, so we're doing this, are we?
Name's Neve Kelly.

12:42.720 --> 12:44.400
N-E-V-E.

12:45.080 --> 12:47.080
She's 19.

12:47.120 --> 12:48.000
She left the house
around00 last night.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.760
She left the house
around00 last night.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.560
Hey, stop it. This isn't funny!

12:54.600 --> 12:56.000
I've called her dad - no answer -
and her boyfriend.

12:56.000 --> 12:56.840
I've called her dad - no answer -
and her boyfriend.

12:56.880 --> 12:58.920
Mum, listen to me.

12:58.960 --> 13:01.720
She always comes home.
It doesn't feel right.

13:01.760 --> 13:04.000
Fuck's sake! I'm right here!

13:04.000 --> 13:04.080
Fuck's sake! I'm right here!

13:05.600 --> 13:07.360
Yes, I'll hold.

13:30.320 --> 13:32.080
Katie!

13:34.840 --> 13:36.000
Hey.

13:36.000 --> 13:36.440
Hey.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.840
Mum's super pissed at me.

13:42.480 --> 13:44.000
Hey, look at me.

13:44.000 --> 13:44.760
Hey, look at me.

13:46.280 --> 13:48.160
So, you're in on it, too.

13:50.920 --> 13:52.000
OK, you got me.

13:52.000 --> 13:53.120
OK, you got me.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.080
Katie!

14:14.560 --> 14:16.000
Oh, shit.

14:16.000 --> 14:16.360
Oh, shit.

15:04.320 --> 15:08.320
I don't know what I am inside

15:09.360 --> 15:12.000
this face were never mine

15:12.000 --> 15:12.840
this face were never mine

15:18.960 --> 15:20.000
when I tell them lies

15:20.000 --> 15:23.400
when I tell them lies

15:24.200 --> 15:27.040
and never cry

16:27.000 --> 16:29.400
Couldn't even stagger
to your own front door?

16:31.240 --> 16:32.000
Oh, those aren't mine.
I took a mate home last night.

16:32.000 --> 16:34.680
Oh, those aren't mine.
I took a mate home last night.

16:36.080 --> 16:38.240
God, lighten up.

16:38.920 --> 16:40.000
Maria's been calling.
You seen Neve?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.400
Maria's been calling.
You seen Neve?

16:42.160 --> 16:45.400
No.
She didn't come home last night.

16:45.440 --> 16:48.000
I found her phone by the woods
but there's no sign of her.

16:48.000 --> 16:48.880
I found her phone by the woods
but there's no sign of her.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.320
She probably just crashed
in someone's tent.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.840
You were at the party.
When did you last see her?

16:53.880 --> 16:56.000
I wasn't watching the clock.

16:56.000 --> 16:56.160
I wasn't watching the clock.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.400
Guess your daughter
isn't your top priority.

17:02.440 --> 17:04.000
I need to keep looking.

17:04.000 --> 17:04.360
I need to keep looking.

17:06.760 --> 17:10.120
I'll call William, get him
to ask the Motocross boys to help.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.000
They were all at the party.

17:12.000 --> 17:12.280
They were all at the party.

17:12.320 --> 17:14.360
Go for it.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.000
'He's pulled away from the pack.
Joseph Wyatt wins.'

18:08.000 --> 18:09.600
'He's pulled away from the pack.
Joseph Wyatt wins.'

18:13.840 --> 18:16.000
What time do you call that, then?

18:16.000 --> 18:16.080
What time do you call that, then?

18:16.120 --> 18:18.600
Good luck beating it.

18:21.240 --> 18:24.000
The mud's turned up round the back.
Take the inside. Don't go wide.

18:24.000 --> 18:24.840
The mud's turned up round the back.
Take the inside. Don't go wide.

18:25.560 --> 18:27.560
Is that what you did?

18:27.600 --> 18:28.720
No.

18:28.760 --> 18:30.480
Well, then.

18:31.880 --> 18:32.000
Hello?

18:32.000 --> 18:33.560
Hello?

18:40.720 --> 18:44.360
'Will the 250 Juniors please
make their way to the start gate?'

18:44.400 --> 18:47.480
Hey. You've got this.

19:06.400 --> 19:09.480
When did you last see her?
Um...

19:09.520 --> 19:12.000
Maybe- 00,- 30.

19:12.680 --> 19:15.280
There were loads of people there.
I guess I lost track.

19:15.320 --> 19:17.400
But...why did you leave her?

19:18.240 --> 19:19.920
I thought she'd gone home.

19:19.960 --> 19:20.000
I tried calling.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.000
I tried calling.

19:23.880 --> 19:25.360
How was she?

19:26.440 --> 19:28.000
Yeah. Fine. Normal.

19:28.000 --> 19:28.960
Yeah. Fine. Normal.

19:30.360 --> 19:33.280
Right. I'm gonna meet Daniel
down at the field.

19:33.320 --> 19:35.880
All right. I want to help look.
I'll get my dad.

19:35.920 --> 19:36.000
Thanks, Joe.

19:36.000 --> 19:37.760
Thanks, Joe.

19:41.800 --> 19:43.640
Max.

19:43.680 --> 19:44.000
We need to go.
Dad wants us to help look for Neve.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.840
We need to go.
Dad wants us to help look for Neve.

19:47.520 --> 19:49.960
Are you OK?
It's happening again.

19:52.960 --> 19:55.560
Don't talk like that. Come on.

19:57.160 --> 20:00.000
She probably passed out
in a hedge somewhere.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.400
Max, I'm here.

20:26.200 --> 20:28.800
Get a move on!
Um, where are we going?

20:28.840 --> 20:31.480
We're meeting everyone
down at the party field.

20:38.480 --> 20:40.000
You all right?

20:40.000 --> 20:40.360
You all right?

21:31.960 --> 21:36.000
'Number 44, local rider Neve
Kelly, coming from behind the pack.

21:37.000 --> 21:40.400
She's pushing hard now
on the outside of the turn there.'

21:42.240 --> 21:44.000
Yes!
Come on! Come on!

21:44.000 --> 21:44.680
Yes!
Come on! Come on!

22:03.200 --> 22:06.440
'Kelly, number 44, goes round
the outside to take third place.'

22:06.480 --> 22:08.000
Come on, Neve!
Come on, Neve! Come on!

22:08.000 --> 22:09.640
Come on, Neve!
Come on, Neve! Come on!

22:13.960 --> 22:16.000
'Pushing really hard now.
She's in third.

22:16.000 --> 22:16.200
'Pushing really hard now.
She's in third.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.680
She's got second and first
in sight.'

22:18.720 --> 22:21.120
That's it, Neve!

22:24.120 --> 22:26.360
'She pushes into the jump.'

22:31.800 --> 22:32.000
Come on, Neve!

22:32.000 --> 22:33.280
Come on, Neve!

22:33.320 --> 22:36.560
'Kelly has moved into second place.
Can she take the lead?'

23:02.680 --> 23:04.000
Just follow the line of the trees.

23:04.000 --> 23:04.840
Just follow the line of the trees.

23:04.880 --> 23:06.600
Any news?
No.

23:06.640 --> 23:09.440
We want to help. Should we split
into different groups -

23:09.480 --> 23:11.760
That'll do, Michael.
I'm handling it.

23:14.520 --> 23:18.040
Are you sure you didn't see her
go off with someone?

23:18.080 --> 23:20.000
No. I don't know where she is.

23:20.000 --> 23:20.360
No. I don't know where she is.

23:21.040 --> 23:24.400
Right. You head off with that group.
Start combing the woods.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.680
Sure.
Oi... We'll find her.

23:28.160 --> 23:29.800
Yeah.

23:29.840 --> 23:31.680
I pulled the whole club out of bed.

23:31.720 --> 23:34.200
There's another party
searching the farms,

23:34.240 --> 23:36.000
and Fritzy's checking out
the train station.

23:36.000 --> 23:36.560
and Fritzy's checking out
the train station.

23:36.600 --> 23:38.240
Thanks, William.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.720
What can I do?
Did you check the hotel?

23:40.760 --> 23:42.240
I'll go do it now.

23:42.280 --> 23:44.000
Christ, Michael. You live next door.

23:44.000 --> 23:44.680
Christ, Michael. You live next door.

23:45.760 --> 23:47.760
We'll split up and start looking.

23:50.080 --> 23:52.000
Are they looking for a body?
Oh, Max! Are they?

23:52.000 --> 23:52.520
Are they looking for a body?
Oh, Max! Are they?

23:52.560 --> 23:54.640
No. Course not.

23:54.680 --> 23:57.280
You don't need to worry.
She's out there somewhere.

23:57.320 --> 23:59.840
We're gonna find her. She's fine.

24:00.880 --> 24:02.880
Why don't you guys
go wait by the car?

24:02.920 --> 24:04.360
We want to help.
I know,

24:04.400 --> 24:06.680
but there's enough people here now.

24:11.200 --> 24:12.800
Look after your brother.

24:12.840 --> 24:15.040
Call your nan,
get her to come pick you up.

24:15.080 --> 24:16.000
We'll meet you
back at the house. OK?

24:16.000 --> 24:17.360
We'll meet you
back at the house. OK?

24:24.360 --> 24:26.320
I shouldn't have brought them.

24:27.960 --> 24:31.160
When Neve gets home, I'm gonna
give her such a bollocking.

24:32.320 --> 24:33.440
Come on.

24:34.600 --> 24:36.600
Come on.

24:51.280 --> 24:53.320
Spread out!

24:53.360 --> 24:55.360
You lot head that way!

25:40.040 --> 25:42.680
It's a fucking wild one, isn't it?
Fucking wild.

25:42.720 --> 25:44.000
What are you saying?

25:44.000 --> 25:44.720
What are you saying?

25:57.000 --> 26:00.000
I just want to say,
right, I love you. OK?

26:00.000 --> 26:01.560
I just want to say,
right, I love you. OK?

26:01.600 --> 26:03.400
I think you're such a great sister.

26:03.440 --> 26:05.520
Honestly. You are Neve Kelly.

26:05.560 --> 26:08.000
You are Neve fucking Kelly.
Yes, Neve!

26:08.000 --> 26:08.960
You are Neve fucking Kelly.
Yes, Neve!

26:12.560 --> 26:14.560
I just want us to be close.

26:14.600 --> 26:16.000
Are you.... Are you OK?

26:16.000 --> 26:16.840
Are you.... Are you OK?

26:20.320 --> 26:23.000
Tide

26:41.000 --> 26:42.720
I love you.

26:45.600 --> 26:47.600
What's the matter?

26:59.560 --> 27:01.640
I'm in the lake.

27:01.680 --> 27:03.920
What?

27:03.960 --> 27:04.000
They're looking in the wrong place.

27:04.000 --> 27:06.040
They're looking in the wrong place.

27:06.080 --> 27:08.080
'I'm in the lake.'

27:12.760 --> 27:14.400
Neve!?

27:14.440 --> 27:15.760
Neve!

27:16.400 --> 27:18.560
Neve!
Neve!

27:18.600 --> 27:20.000
Neve!

27:20.000 --> 27:20.280
Neve!

27:21.800 --> 27:23.800
Neve!
Neve!

27:24.480 --> 27:26.640
Neve!
Neve!

27:28.120 --> 27:29.760
Neve!

27:31.280 --> 27:33.200
Hey.
Hey.

27:34.320 --> 27:35.720
Neve!

27:35.760 --> 27:36.000
She'll be off
with her mates somewhere.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.320
She'll be off
with her mates somewhere.

27:39.000 --> 27:41.280
Her mates are here, looking for her.

27:43.040 --> 27:44.000
What?

27:44.000 --> 27:45.040
What?

27:45.080 --> 27:46.880
It's just water.

27:47.640 --> 27:49.120
Want some?

27:51.240 --> 27:52.000
So you've no idea
where Neve might be?

27:52.000 --> 27:53.480
So you've no idea
where Neve might be?

27:54.520 --> 27:57.600
I hardly ever see her. Why would I?
That's not my fault.

27:57.640 --> 27:59.720
I didn't say it was.

28:01.680 --> 28:03.560
But you talked to her last night?

28:03.600 --> 28:06.800
Yeah. About...five minutes.

28:09.080 --> 28:12.360
To be fair, that's the most
she's spoken to me in ages.

28:12.400 --> 28:14.320
And how did she seem?

28:16.080 --> 28:17.600
OK.

28:19.600 --> 28:21.200
But...

28:21.240 --> 28:23.640
What?
I don't know.

28:23.680 --> 28:24.000
Kinda sad.

28:24.000 --> 28:25.680
Kinda sad.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.960
I asked her if she was all right
but sh...

28:28.000 --> 28:30.320
she wouldn't tell me if she wasn't.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.000
She'd tell you.

28:32.000 --> 28:32.360
She'd tell you.

28:35.360 --> 28:37.440
We had a fight last night.

28:39.960 --> 28:40.000
What about?

28:40.000 --> 28:41.760
What about?

28:43.600 --> 28:45.600
Doesn't matter.

28:50.160 --> 28:52.000
All right.

28:52.040 --> 28:54.840
I can't pretend to know
anything about her life...

28:55.640 --> 28:56.000
..but I know she loves you.

28:56.000 --> 28:57.840
..but I know she loves you.

28:59.240 --> 29:01.440
Then where the hell is she?

29:06.600 --> 29:09.360
Maria? Hey. Hi, Tom.

29:09.400 --> 29:10.840
Christine.

29:13.120 --> 29:17.160
William tipped me off so I thought
I'd help out before uniform arrive.

29:17.200 --> 29:18.840
Thank you.

29:18.880 --> 29:20.000
I'm not gonna ask if you're OK.

29:20.000 --> 29:21.000
I'm not gonna ask if you're OK.

29:21.040 --> 29:23.880
If it was Alex,
I'd be tearing my hair out.

29:25.600 --> 29:28.000
Can I have a quick chat
with you and Daniel?

29:28.000 --> 29:28.320
Can I have a quick chat
with you and Daniel?

29:28.360 --> 29:29.680
Sure.

29:30.920 --> 29:32.800
Is there anything I can do?

29:32.840 --> 29:34.840
Not right now. Thanks.

29:45.440 --> 29:48.560
Neve!
Neve!

29:48.600 --> 29:51.000
Neve!
Neve!

29:51.040 --> 29:52.000
Neve!
Neve!

29:52.000 --> 29:53.280
Neve!
Neve!

29:54.120 --> 29:56.920
Neve!
Neve!

29:56.960 --> 29:58.880
Neve!

29:58.920 --> 30:00.000
Does she have any friends
she stays with regularly?

30:00.000 --> 30:01.760
Does she have any friends
she stays with regularly?

30:02.920 --> 30:04.720
No.
OK.

30:05.600 --> 30:08.000
Was Neve romantically involved
with anyone other than Joe?

30:08.000 --> 30:08.640
Was Neve romantically involved
with anyone other than Joe?

30:08.680 --> 30:10.440
No, of course not.

30:10.480 --> 30:12.400
What are you trying to say?

30:12.440 --> 30:14.240
Rebel.

30:16.000 --> 30:17.760
Hey, girl.

30:20.680 --> 30:23.160
You know I'm here.

30:29.600 --> 30:32.000
It's great so many people are out
looking but until uniform get here

30:32.000 --> 30:33.320
It's great so many people are out
looking but until uniform get here

30:33.360 --> 30:36.800
we need to be careful not to disturb
any evidence as to her whereabouts.

30:36.840 --> 30:38.680
Evidence?

30:40.400 --> 30:42.320
I just want to find my daughter.

30:45.920 --> 30:48.000
Come on, girl.

30:51.280 --> 30:52.760
Rebel.

30:53.520 --> 30:55.040
Rebel!

30:55.840 --> 30:56.000
Rebel!

30:56.000 --> 30:57.160
Rebel!

30:57.920 --> 31:00.160
For God's sake, don't lose the dog.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.280
Maybe she's picked up a scent.

31:07.640 --> 31:10.200
This is Detective Wyatt!

31:10.240 --> 31:12.000
I need you all to listen!

31:12.000 --> 31:12.360
I need you all to listen!

31:12.400 --> 31:16.400
If anyone finds anything -
anything at all -

31:16.440 --> 31:19.400
do...not...touch it!

31:19.440 --> 31:20.000
Is that clear?

31:20.000 --> 31:20.960
Is that clear?

31:21.000 --> 31:23.320
Spread the word!

31:30.760 --> 31:32.480
Rebel.

31:40.360 --> 31:42.360
Rebel.

32:31.360 --> 32:32.000
I'm here.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.160
I'm here.

32:33.200 --> 32:35.000
Come find me.

32:53.440 --> 32:55.720
You know what my nan used to say?

32:56.680 --> 32:58.680
Follow the birds.

33:02.920 --> 33:04.000
There's something in the water.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.240
There's something in the water.

33:06.480 --> 33:09.160
There's something in the water!
What if she's in there?

33:09.200 --> 33:10.880
Someone do something!
Maria!

33:10.920 --> 33:12.000
Wait! Wait!
Come on. Come on, please. No.

33:12.000 --> 33:13.320
Wait! Wait!
Come on. Come on, please. No.

33:13.360 --> 33:16.680
Wait! Wait! Everybody stand back!

33:16.720 --> 33:20.000
We have to do this properly!
Get her out! Get her out!

33:20.000 --> 33:21.040
We have to do this properly!
Get her out! Get her out!

33:21.080 --> 33:22.800
Get her out!

33:48.000 --> 33:50.080
I love you, Mum.

34:11.720 --> 34:13.800
I'm so sorry.

34:24.200 --> 34:27.120
Neve!

34:29.960 --> 34:31.520
Neve!

34:33.880 --> 34:36.360
OK. Stand back... No, don't...

34:36.400 --> 34:38.280
No! No! No, no.

34:39.280 --> 34:40.000
No. No.

34:40.000 --> 34:41.480
No. No.

34:42.360 --> 34:43.560
No.

34:53.240 --> 34:56.000
Tom, stay back.
You don't need to see this.

34:56.000 --> 34:56.040
Tom, stay back.
You don't need to see this.

34:58.920 --> 35:00.640
Neve?

35:01.560 --> 35:03.200
Wake up.

35:03.720 --> 35:04.000
Wake up.

35:04.000 --> 35:05.320
Wake up.

35:06.040 --> 35:08.440
I need you to wake up, Neve.

35:26.720 --> 35:28.000
It's too late, Tom.

35:28.000 --> 35:28.560
It's too late, Tom.

35:29.400 --> 35:32.360
It's too late.
Come on. Come on.

35:32.400 --> 35:34.200
That's it.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.000
Let's go home, yeah?

36:32.000 --> 36:33.040
Let's go home, yeah?

36:33.080 --> 36:35.000
I'll come and check on you later.

36:35.040 --> 36:37.760
You shouldn't be
on your own tonight.

36:37.800 --> 36:39.640
He won't be.

36:40.320 --> 36:42.040
Come on, son.

36:52.200 --> 36:54.000
Come on, love.

36:54.680 --> 36:56.000
Let's get you in the warm.

36:56.000 --> 36:56.680
Let's get you in the warm.

36:59.400 --> 37:01.400
I don't want to leave her.

37:03.960 --> 37:04.000
They'll look after her.

37:04.000 --> 37:05.960
They'll look after her.

37:22.600 --> 37:24.320
Boss.
Hey.

37:26.280 --> 37:28.000
We've found something
further up the beach.

37:28.000 --> 37:28.960
We've found something
further up the beach.

37:44.200 --> 37:46.080
The fire's recent.

37:46.120 --> 37:48.080
You can smell it.

37:49.200 --> 37:51.040
Get forensics over here.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.920
Dad?

38:52.960 --> 38:54.280
Dad.

38:55.320 --> 38:56.000
Can you see me? Dad?

38:56.000 --> 38:57.800
Can you see me? Dad?

39:04.000 --> 39:06.000
Oh, my God, you can.

39:07.840 --> 39:09.320
What the fuck?

39:11.920 --> 39:12.000
I just saw your body.
I know.

39:12.000 --> 39:14.480
I just saw your body.
I know.

39:14.520 --> 39:16.480
I saw it.
Look, I know this is crazy.

39:16.520 --> 39:19.760
I don't understand it either.
Don't... Stop talking to me.

39:19.800 --> 39:20.000
Tom?

39:20.000 --> 39:21.520
Tom?

39:23.360 --> 39:25.040
Are you OK?

39:29.280 --> 39:30.960
Uh...

39:31.000 --> 39:33.360
I... I thought I saw someone.

39:35.560 --> 39:36.000
I need to get out of here.

39:36.000 --> 39:37.520
I need to get out of here.

39:38.760 --> 39:41.400
Can I take you home?
No. Um...

39:42.800 --> 39:44.000
I just... I just...
I just want to be alone.

39:44.000 --> 39:45.440
I just... I just...
I just want to be alone.

39:46.120 --> 39:48.080
Dad, let's go.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.200
Dad.

40:02.920 --> 40:05.600
I'm having a breakdown.

40:05.640 --> 40:08.000
You can't leave me.
No.

40:08.000 --> 40:08.240
You can't leave me.
No.

40:08.280 --> 40:11.240
You seriously gonna walk away?
This is the guilt talking.

40:11.280 --> 40:13.120
Dad!
Just leave me alone.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.640
Dad, listen to me!
Just leave me alone!

40:20.120 --> 40:22.280
Dad, wait. Please don't go.

40:24.160 --> 40:25.920
Dad, look at me.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.400
Dad, look at me!

40:51.480 --> 40:53.840
No, no, no, no, no.

40:58.040 --> 41:00.400
Dad! Dad, stop!

41:02.400 --> 41:04.000
Please!
This isn't real!

41:04.000 --> 41:04.760
Please!
This isn't real!

41:04.800 --> 41:06.640
You can't abandon me!

41:08.520 --> 41:10.080
Leave me alone!

41:10.120 --> 41:12.000
Dad!
You're dead!

41:12.000 --> 41:12.240
Dad!
You're dead!

41:37.880 --> 41:39.600
Stop, Dad. Stop!

42:00.240 --> 42:01.920
Neve! Neve!

42:16.880 --> 42:18.760
I'm still here.

42:20.840 --> 42:22.840
And I need your help.

42:36.920 --> 42:39.000
What happened to you last night?

42:39.040 --> 42:40.000
'We were talking. That's one of
the last things I remember.'

42:40.000 --> 42:41.840
'We were talking. That's one of
the last things I remember.'

42:41.880 --> 42:44.760
Maybe she was in such a state
it was some sort of accident.

42:46.240 --> 42:48.000
'This was someone we know.'

42:48.000 --> 42:49.120
'This was someone we know.'

42:50.280 --> 42:52.640
How dare you say
I don't know how it feels?

42:53.440 --> 42:56.000
'The victim
had the substance administered
without their knowledge.'

42:56.000 --> 42:57.440
'The victim
had the substance administered
without their knowledge.'

42:57.480 --> 42:59.200
You listen to me!
What's happened?

42:59.240 --> 43:02.880
Oh, apparently, Neve's not dead.
No, that's not what I said.

43:02.920 --> 43:04.000
Get him out of my house!

43:04.000 --> 43:04.480
Get him out of my house!

43:06.720 --> 43:09.720
Investigating your own murder.
I mean, that's a mindful.

43:11.040 --> 43:12.000
'We are appealing
for witnesses to come forward.'

43:12.000 --> 43:13.400
'We are appealing
for witnesses to come forward.'

43:13.440 --> 43:16.160
So we're sticking to our story?
Yeah.

43:16.960 --> 43:20.000
Tell me what happened that night.
Think she'd forgive us?

43:20.000 --> 43:20.200
Tell me what happened that night.
Think she'd forgive us?

43:20.240 --> 43:23.520
I wouldn't.
'Please, contact the police.'

43:23.560 --> 43:26.040
Don't you want to know the truth?
I want my life back.

43:26.080 --> 43:28.000
I know exactly
what kind of man you are.

43:28.000 --> 43:28.800
I know exactly
what kind of man you are.

43:28.840 --> 43:31.960
I'm not going away, not till
I figure out who did this to me.
