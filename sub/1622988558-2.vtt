Mike, there are ants everywhere!

02:08.868 --> 02:10.337
(exhaling)

02:10.404 --> 02:12.509
‐What?
‐There are ants
all over the place.

02:12.575 --> 02:13.711
How am I supposed
to make an album

02:13.778 --> 02:15.815
if there's fucking ants
crawling?

02:15.882 --> 02:17.719
‐Explain that to me.
‐Ants are distracting you
from making an album?

02:17.786 --> 02:19.890
‐Yes.
‐Little tiny things
that crawl around

02:19.956 --> 02:22.294
‐are really ruining
your album‐making?
‐They're on my microphone,

02:22.361 --> 02:23.864
in my studio,
crawling on the walls.

02:23.931 --> 02:25.935
(stammers)
Do you see them right here?

02:26.002 --> 02:27.605
‐Acknowledge it.
‐I‐I see it.
I am acknowledging it.

02:27.672 --> 02:29.543
I'm also acknowledging
this feels like you got

02:29.609 --> 02:30.912
too high again.
Is that what this is?

02:30.978 --> 02:32.348
‐I'm not too high.
‐You are.

02:32.414 --> 02:33.617
You have cottonmouth,
you're... (smacks lips)

02:33.684 --> 02:35.655
...you're dry again.
I can hear it.

02:35.722 --> 02:37.692
‐Give me the vacuum, dude.
I'll do it.
‐Yeah, take it. And‐‐

02:37.759 --> 02:39.563
‐I'll take care of it.
‐You said you'd clean up
the fucking house.

02:39.629 --> 02:41.432
‐That never happened, so...
‐That helps. Thank you so much.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.036
By the way, I'm bringing the
ants up to the new label person.

02:43.103 --> 02:44.305
‐Sorry.
‐The new label person
gave us this house

02:44.372 --> 02:45.908
to get away from distractions,

02:45.975 --> 02:48.246
and now all you're doing
is trying to find distractions.

02:48.313 --> 02:50.350
Dave, I know making
an album is hard, but...

02:50.417 --> 02:52.388
Excuse me? What‐what do you know
about making an album?

02:52.454 --> 02:54.593
‐Just out of curiosity?
‐I know that you don't
have anything.

02:54.659 --> 02:56.362
Not at all. You've got nothing.

02:56.429 --> 02:57.766
And the only way
to get something

02:57.832 --> 03:00.705
‐is to start doing something.
‐I'm trying.

03:00.772 --> 03:02.542
GATA:
Hey, Dave, you ain't never lied
about this VR porn, bro.

03:02.609 --> 03:04.713
She getting straight
to the action.

03:04.780 --> 03:06.617
You don't need to be holding
the remotes. You're in, like‐‐

03:06.683 --> 03:10.023
‐There's nothing‐‐
Are your hands white?
‐Yeah. Why?

03:10.090 --> 03:11.860
‐Why not?
‐MIKE: Because
of systemic racism.

03:11.927 --> 03:13.497
‐This is what I'm talking about.
‐What do you mean?

03:13.564 --> 03:15.735
$1,900 last week
on sex paraphernalia

03:15.802 --> 03:17.639
‐instead of making an album.
‐Thank God

03:17.706 --> 03:19.543
‐I have these machines.
I'm not dating.
‐Oh, shit!

03:19.609 --> 03:20.945
Imagine if I was dating someone
right now and spending money

03:21.012 --> 03:22.949
and going on dates, like,
that's so time‐consuming.

03:23.016 --> 03:25.655
This is a net savings on time.
I have to cream, don't I?

03:25.722 --> 03:27.759
You have to cream? Can you cream
a little bit less, then?

03:27.826 --> 03:29.295
(scoffs)

03:31.399 --> 03:34.806
‐I love you, Gata.
‐I'm over here just
twisting nips, bro.

03:34.873 --> 03:36.008
I see.

03:36.075 --> 03:37.211
(FaceTime ringing)

03:37.277 --> 03:38.514
‐Elz.
‐ELZ: What's good?

03:38.581 --> 03:39.816
Didn't you have
a pretty bad ant problem

03:39.883 --> 03:41.252
at your place at La Brea?

03:41.319 --> 03:42.889
Oh, my God, I wish.
I had crickets.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.026
‐They were the worst.
‐What city are you in right now?

03:45.093 --> 03:47.766
‐Is it Copenhagen?
‐Bro, I'm in L. A. right now.

03:47.832 --> 03:50.437
I'm in L. A.
I'm just walking my dog.

03:50.505 --> 03:51.974
You're back in L. A.?

03:52.040 --> 03:54.111
‐Yeah.
‐How long have you been back?

03:54.178 --> 03:55.948
‐A week.
‐A week?

03:56.015 --> 03:57.819
And you didn't even
tell me about it?

03:57.886 --> 04:00.290
I mean, I don't know,
w‐was I supposed to?

04:00.357 --> 04:03.196
That's so weird that you'd not
tell me when you came back.

04:03.263 --> 04:05.200
I think it's weirder for you
to think that it's weird

04:05.267 --> 04:07.705
that I didn't tell you
that I got back home.

04:07.772 --> 04:11.112
‐Okay.
‐But I'm just trying
to catch my bearings.

04:11.179 --> 04:13.049
I'm having a thing tonight,
though, if you're around.

04:13.116 --> 04:15.253
Me and the homies are gonna
throw a little shindig.

04:15.320 --> 04:16.824
So, let me ask you this.

04:16.890 --> 04:18.494
If I didn't call you right now,
would I have even gotten

04:18.561 --> 04:19.963
a secondhand invitation
to this thing?

04:20.030 --> 04:21.767
Dude, I just started
thinking about this

04:21.834 --> 04:23.904
and just started hitting people
up about it, so relax.

04:23.971 --> 04:25.575
Is Ally going?

04:25.641 --> 04:26.844
‐(laughs)
‐By the way,
I don't care if she is,

04:26.910 --> 04:28.814
I just have to know
those things.

04:28.881 --> 04:31.352
Dude, you're so weird.
What if she is there? Whatever.

04:31.419 --> 04:32.956
I texted her about it,
but, like,

04:33.022 --> 04:35.127
don't be weird about her coming
if she comes, though.

04:35.193 --> 04:36.930
Shut up. Text me the info.

04:36.997 --> 04:38.901
‐All right, weirdo.
‐I love you. Bye.

04:38.968 --> 04:41.205
‐(phone chimes)
‐GATA: This shit is crazy.

04:41.272 --> 04:44.513
‐(Gata whoops)
‐I think I'm gonna
see Ally tonight.

04:44.579 --> 04:47.117
Oh, my, I think
he's about to ejaculate.

04:48.353 --> 04:50.792
What did you think was gonna
happen at the end of the porn?

04:50.858 --> 04:52.929
MIKE:
I'm gonna talk about Korea,
you can mention the ants,

04:52.996 --> 04:55.167
but, uh, can you not tell them
where you are musically?

04:55.233 --> 04:57.471
DAVE:
This isn't about the ants, okay?
This is about setting a tone.

04:57.539 --> 04:59.074
There's a new person
we're talking to.

04:59.141 --> 05:00.978
Okay, well, do you realize
your pant is coated in mud?

05:01.045 --> 05:02.949
I wouldn't say it's coated,
but yeah, I had to deal

05:03.016 --> 05:04.986
with all the ants and I tripped
in mud, Mike, sue me.

05:05.053 --> 05:06.957
Okay. I'm not gonna sue you,
but it sounds like

05:07.024 --> 05:08.761
‐you had time to change.
‐TESSA (laughs): Mike and Dave.

05:08.828 --> 05:10.765
‐Tessa.
‐So great to meet
you guys in person.

05:10.832 --> 05:12.502
‐DAVE: Hello. How are you?
‐Welcome.
‐It's great to see you.

05:12.569 --> 05:15.106
‐Hey. Oh... Hey.
‐(both laugh)

05:15.173 --> 05:18.581
‐Uh...
‐So good to put a name
to that, there‐‐ to your face.

05:18.647 --> 05:21.620
‐Sure, well, follow me.
‐Okay.

05:21.687 --> 05:24.291
TESSA:
Dave, I hear you
are a Perrier man.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.162
I am.
You did your research, huh?

05:26.229 --> 05:28.199
Yeah. We got a file on you.

05:28.266 --> 05:31.673
It's great that you're a woman,
by the way. That's dope.

05:31.740 --> 05:34.746
‐Thanks.
‐Uh, but let's talk
about a few things.

05:34.813 --> 05:38.486
The main thing is that our house
is totally overrun by ants.

05:38.554 --> 05:39.890
‐What?
‐And it's disgusting.

05:39.956 --> 05:41.425
‐Completely unacceptable.
‐Oh, my God, Dave,

05:41.493 --> 05:43.631
I couldn't agree more.
That's gross.

05:43.697 --> 05:45.835
Oh.

05:45.902 --> 05:47.772
Okay.

05:47.839 --> 05:50.210
That's not the only reason
we're here, obviously.

05:50.277 --> 05:52.815
Oh, no, no, no. Please. Your
house is infested with pests.

05:52.882 --> 05:54.519
We'll take care of it
right away.

05:54.586 --> 05:56.355
Can you hold tight
for a second or should

05:56.422 --> 05:57.559
we be talking relocation?

05:57.625 --> 05:59.529
‐How bad is it?
‐It's not bad.

05:59.596 --> 06:01.199
The important thing
is that you're identifying it

06:01.265 --> 06:03.036
‐as a problem. Thank you.
‐Yeah.

06:03.102 --> 06:06.910
You should also be aware that we
can't be incurred for any costs

06:06.977 --> 06:11.853
that come with poisoning
the insectoids or...

06:11.920 --> 06:13.657
‐Oh, no, we got, we got that.
‐Okay.

06:13.724 --> 06:15.494
That's on us, for sure.

06:15.561 --> 06:17.498
Because our budget
is already pencil‐dick thin.

06:17.565 --> 06:20.403
‐So...
‐MIKE: Yeah, speaking of
the budget, some shit went down

06:20.470 --> 06:22.341
in Korea.
(chuckles)

06:22.407 --> 06:24.879
Uh, the‐‐ uh,
I've been reaching out

06:24.946 --> 06:27.017
to the State Department as well
as multiple insurance companies.

06:27.084 --> 06:29.689
‐Our intern Dan‐‐
who is safe, by the way...
‐Mm.

06:29.756 --> 06:32.160
...is working a desk job,
he's been militarized.

06:32.227 --> 06:33.597
‐(clears throat)
‐Oh.

06:33.664 --> 06:34.900
I think it'll be good for him,
to tap in...

06:34.966 --> 06:36.837
You know,
we can talk about Korea later.

06:36.904 --> 06:40.343
I was thinking today would be
the perfect opportunity

06:40.410 --> 06:42.615
to finally set
that release date.

06:43.651 --> 06:45.120
‐Release date?
‐MIKE: I don't think we're‐‐

06:45.186 --> 06:46.723
I don't think today's
the day we're actually gonna

06:46.790 --> 06:47.659
commit to something, though,
unfortunately.

06:47.725 --> 06:49.295
(Dave chuckles, stammers)

06:49.361 --> 06:52.367
I‐I can't see myself committing
to anything of the sort.

06:52.434 --> 06:54.673
Look, I get it.
I do, but, you know,

06:54.739 --> 06:56.442
once you settle on a date,
that helps us unlock

06:56.510 --> 06:57.879
what we can do for you.

06:57.946 --> 06:59.883
‐Mm‐hmm.
‐You know, the marketing,
the promos,

06:59.950 --> 07:02.487
avoiding other releases,
and dates get snapped up, quick.

07:02.555 --> 07:05.160
‐Yeah. Yeah.
‐But, you know, just, whatever
you're comfortable with.

07:05.226 --> 07:08.567
A‐And I get it.
I used to be a marketing guy.

07:08.634 --> 07:09.769
I think about these things
all the time.

07:09.836 --> 07:11.974
‐I sit at home and I think.
‐Mm‐hmm.

07:12.040 --> 07:13.510
I have, like, things written
down, all over the room,

07:13.577 --> 07:15.380
‐written.
‐Love that.

07:15.447 --> 07:17.619
What if we released
my album on 9/11?

07:17.685 --> 07:20.256
‐MIKE: Mm. Hmm.
‐Yeah.

07:20.323 --> 07:22.127
Honestly, in my humble opinion,
9/11 the date

07:22.194 --> 07:24.699
should not always
be about 9/11 the attack.

07:24.766 --> 07:26.503
‐Forever.
‐TESSA: Ooh.
‐Okay, well,

07:26.570 --> 07:28.674
this 9/11 the date
is the 20th anniversary

07:28.741 --> 07:31.880
of the 9/11 attack,
so this year it heavily will be.

07:31.947 --> 07:34.953
Mm. What about April Fools' Day?

07:35.020 --> 07:36.890
Dave, are you kidding?
That's genius.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.994
‐DAVE: Right? It is clever.
‐It's so clever.

07:39.061 --> 07:42.234
‐4/1.
‐But will people think
it's real?

07:42.301 --> 07:45.073
‐Yes.
‐They'll press play
and they'll know it's real.

07:45.140 --> 07:46.743
All right, it is smart.

07:46.810 --> 07:48.479
Good, well, how about‐‐
why don't we just pencil it in?

07:48.547 --> 07:50.483
‐No, put it in pen.
‐(Tessa laughs)

07:50.551 --> 07:51.920
Done.

07:51.987 --> 07:53.857
‐DAVE: I like it.
‐I love it.

07:53.924 --> 07:56.697
‐We'll do 4/1. Perfect.
‐(Mike coughs)

08:00.971 --> 08:03.844
(sighs)
Do ants have souls?

08:03.911 --> 08:06.650
I think all animals have souls.

08:06.717 --> 08:10.056
Yeah, but an ant's not
an animal, it's an insect.

08:10.123 --> 08:11.927
Insects are animals.

08:11.994 --> 08:16.402
They eat, breathe,
have intentions, social groups.

08:16.469 --> 08:18.907
What do you think a soul is?

08:20.745 --> 08:23.049
So, a fish...

08:23.116 --> 08:25.220
is an animal.

08:26.590 --> 08:28.527
It's not a fish.

08:28.594 --> 08:31.500
A fish is most definitely
an animal.

08:32.535 --> 08:34.238
A lamb is an animal.

08:34.304 --> 08:38.312
‐A chop.
‐We're not gonna list
animals right now.

08:38.379 --> 08:40.016
All right.

08:41.118 --> 08:43.891
How are you and Ally getting
to this Elz thing tonight?

08:43.957 --> 08:45.393
‐I'd love to...
‐I'm...

08:45.460 --> 08:47.498

08:50.470 --> 08:52.441

You don't even have a soul.

08:52.508 --> 08:54.344
I can't lie, I'm pretty
jacked up about the whole thing.

08:54.411 --> 08:56.148
I'm been thinking
about it all day,

08:56.215 --> 08:57.785
really playing out
how it's gonna go.

08:57.852 --> 08:59.589
It's been so long since
I've seen her and...

08:59.656 --> 09:02.060
you know, emotions are gonna
be running high.

09:02.127 --> 09:05.100
‐Does she know
about my new house?
‐Yeah.

09:05.166 --> 09:08.106
(exhales)
I‐I feel like I might cry

09:08.172 --> 09:10.110
when I see her, and not because
of any romantic feelings,

09:10.176 --> 09:12.180
but mostly because
of what she means

09:12.247 --> 09:14.586
‐in terms of my old life.
‐Okay, I'm gonna say
something controversial.

09:14.652 --> 09:16.188
Okay.

09:16.255 --> 09:19.128
Have you considered that maybe
you shouldn't see Ally?

09:19.194 --> 09:21.900
Ever? I should just never see
Ally for the rest of my life?

09:21.967 --> 09:24.873
You're not trying to get back
together with her, right?

09:24.939 --> 09:27.244
No, but she's, like, one
of my best friends of all time.

09:27.310 --> 09:29.448
I don't want to just
lose that forever.

09:29.516 --> 09:31.385
Well, how do you know
Ally wants that?

09:31.452 --> 09:33.891
Did she say something to you?
Is she not coming tonight?

09:33.957 --> 09:36.061
No, I honestly haven't
talked to her.

09:36.128 --> 09:37.932
I thought you were
giving her space.

09:37.999 --> 09:39.969
Why is the ball
always in her court?

09:40.036 --> 09:41.840
It's in both your courts,
but demanding

09:41.907 --> 09:44.178
a friendship from her
doesn't make you a good friend.

09:44.244 --> 09:45.648

I'm the only one, like,
trying to salvage this thing.

I'm the one who suggested it
to Elz.

was dumb and awkward,
