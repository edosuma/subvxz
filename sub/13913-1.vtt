03:23.148 --> 03:25.241
-'Night.
-Good night.

04:20.372 --> 04:21.896
Right here is fine.

04:22.440 --> 04:24.374
Think this is bleak enough?

04:24.943 --> 04:29.039
My ears are frozen, my feet are frozen,
this is as far as it goes.

04:29.214 --> 04:30.545
Malt won't like this.

04:32.117 --> 04:35.109
-What's he not going to like?
-He'll find something.

04:35.320 --> 04:36.617
Besides us, you mean?

04:36.822 --> 04:37.811
Yes.

04:38.623 --> 04:39.612
Huey....

04:40.058 --> 04:41.958
You sit in the sled.

04:44.830 --> 04:46.457
Santa, Sparky...

04:46.631 --> 04:47.962
...presents...

04:48.233 --> 04:49.325
...reindeer...

04:49.467 --> 04:50.832
...fake snow.

04:50.969 --> 04:52.596
-What are we missing?
-Children.

04:54.840 --> 04:56.034
Let them out.

04:56.641 --> 04:57.699
Let them out.

05:03.081 --> 05:04.241
What do I do?

05:04.416 --> 05:06.247
You know what to do.

05:06.484 --> 05:09.749
When they handed out the parts,
you got the heart.

05:09.921 --> 05:11.752
Right. I got the heart.

05:12.424 --> 05:14.654
You mean you got the brains?

05:15.260 --> 05:18.593
I mean between the two of us,
you got the heart.

05:18.763 --> 05:21.596
Together we make a person.

05:37.282 --> 05:39.273
What is this, Craddock, a joke?

05:39.885 --> 05:42.115
-Who was in charge here?
-Me.

05:42.287 --> 05:45.279
-I was.
-Right. This was Quinlan's baby.

05:45.457 --> 05:46.515
Quinlan....

05:46.892 --> 05:48.325
Let me ask you a question.

05:49.194 --> 05:53.460
You was a big-shot investigative
reporter for the Chicago Tribune.

05:53.632 --> 05:55.293
Won some prizes.

05:58.103 --> 05:59.468
Give him a biscuit.

05:59.638 --> 06:01.902
What do these look like to you?

06:02.974 --> 06:05.408
They're Indians dressed up as Eskimos.

06:05.543 --> 06:08.034
Indians, Eskimos,
what's the difference?

06:08.213 --> 06:09.976
-That's what we thought.
-Shut up.

06:10.148 --> 06:11.308
That's cool.

06:11.483 --> 06:14.043
Do you know the only prize I ever got?

06:14.219 --> 06:15.811
It's there, on the walls.

06:15.987 --> 06:19.320
I got four and a half
million people who buy...

06:19.724 --> 06:22.056
...the National Mirror every week.

06:22.227 --> 06:23.922
Do you know how many...

06:24.062 --> 06:25.791
...of those 4.5 million readers...

06:25.997 --> 06:28.659
...are Indians or Eskimos
or Eskimo-Indians?

06:28.833 --> 06:31.495
-I told him. American children.
-Americans...

06:31.670 --> 06:33.934
...want to see pictures of Americans.

06:34.072 --> 06:36.370
-They are Americans.
-Americans.

06:36.942 --> 06:39.740
-Is that too much to ask for Christmas?
-No, sir...

06:39.945 --> 06:42.243
...and I'll get someone right on it.

06:44.015 --> 06:46.176
My little poochie, look at you.

06:48.753 --> 06:50.846
If you don't teach that dog...

06:51.022 --> 06:54.458
...some manners soon,
somebody else will have to.

06:55.827 --> 06:58.193
How long were you
Elizabeth Taylor's pool man?

06:58.363 --> 07:01.025
Reincarnation, Miss Hucklow speaking.

07:01.199 --> 07:04.362
Were you on the bed when it levitated?

07:05.036 --> 07:06.765
He lives in your refrigerator?

07:09.708 --> 07:14.475
Can I put you on hold for a second?
I'll go to my desk and take this call.

07:14.612 --> 07:17.274
No, don't let him out. Okay, hold on.

07:37.402 --> 07:39.393
Here's something interesting.

07:48.747 --> 07:51.910
Malt sent you for the tree this year.
I forgot.

07:52.083 --> 07:53.607
I found it in Montana.

07:53.818 --> 07:58.016
As soon as I see it, I know
it's too big to fit on the truck...

07:58.423 --> 08:03.087
...but then I think, what if someone
sees it while I try to find one...

08:03.261 --> 08:05.024
...that'll fit on the truck?

08:05.330 --> 08:07.321
Then Malt gets...

08:07.665 --> 08:11.533
...the second biggest Christmas
tree in the U.S. and I'm screwed.

08:11.669 --> 08:13.830
Yeah, well, that's good thinking.

08:14.039 --> 08:16.030
-So I cut the top off.
-You did that?

08:16.174 --> 08:18.665
I didn't know it'd be
a major problem...

08:18.843 --> 08:21.607
...to put the top part of
a tree back on the bottom.

08:21.780 --> 08:24.544
He will never fire you.
Look at the walls.

08:25.617 --> 08:27.608
Look. Look at the walls.

08:27.786 --> 08:31.119
He's got millions of dollars
tied up in that dog...

08:31.289 --> 08:33.621
...and the dog belongs to you.

08:34.058 --> 08:36.458
Hold on to that dog, Huey.

08:43.635 --> 08:44.863
What?!

08:45.070 --> 08:46.128
Driscoll!

08:47.372 --> 08:49.499
Driscoll, come in here.

08:52.210 --> 08:54.303
We are going to get it, Sparky.

08:56.381 --> 08:59.578
"Dear Mr. Quinlan,
I'm a great admirer...

08:59.717 --> 09:03.380
"...of your prose and can tell
you have a sensitive nature.

09:03.588 --> 09:05.988
"I have had an angel...

09:06.157 --> 09:07.215
"...named...

09:07.392 --> 09:08.723
"...Michael...

09:10.095 --> 09:14.828
"...living with me for almost six
months now. He's extremely polite.

09:15.100 --> 09:20.003
"I have enclosed a photograph to prove
to you that I have not lost my wits.

09:21.739 --> 09:25.505
"I know that you and Sparky
travel all over for your stories.

09:25.677 --> 09:28.271
"That one about the coconut
with the wedding ring inside...

09:28.346 --> 09:30.610
"...was very, very nice.

09:31.182 --> 09:34.117
"And I think you should visit Iowa...

09:36.254 --> 09:37.915
"...and see us...

09:38.123 --> 09:39.351
"...for yourself.

09:40.024 --> 09:42.686
"Sincerely, Pansy Milbank."

09:48.766 --> 09:50.757
Did your mother drop you?

09:51.202 --> 09:54.194
What was going on in that pea brain...

09:54.539 --> 09:59.135
...that let you take this superb
creation of the Lord Almighty...

09:59.277 --> 10:01.370
...and chop it in half?

10:01.546 --> 10:05.038
Whatever I pay you, it's too much.
How much does Fred make?

10:05.216 --> 10:08.879
The janitor? I cannot
survive on a janitor's salary.

10:09.053 --> 10:10.953
-Help me?
-Kill the dog.

10:11.156 --> 10:12.555
Were you invited?

10:12.724 --> 10:15.056
-Let him go on the highway.
-Wait a minute.

10:15.226 --> 10:16.955
What kind of person are you?

10:17.162 --> 10:18.254
Who is this?

10:18.463 --> 10:20.454
Dorothy Winters. She works here.

10:20.665 --> 10:22.360
I do? I got the job?

10:23.401 --> 10:28.168
-You won't regret this, Mr. Malt.
-Do you know what that is?

10:29.174 --> 10:30.232
That...

10:30.408 --> 10:32.740
...is an angel.

10:33.478 --> 10:35.469
That is a genuine angel.

10:35.680 --> 10:36.908
Huey...

10:37.081 --> 10:38.412
...discovered it.

10:38.783 --> 10:41.047
-Is it for real?
-Absolutely.

10:42.687 --> 10:44.678
You'll get me this angel?

10:44.822 --> 10:46.813
That's exactly what we'll do.

10:48.593 --> 10:51.323
We'll put it on the front page, bold.

10:51.763 --> 10:54.698
-Some white fluffy clouds.
-There you go.

10:55.099 --> 10:57.590
-A drift of sky.
-You got it.

10:57.769 --> 10:59.930
And some musical notes.

11:01.206 --> 11:02.503
-Poetry.
-Don't play...

11:02.707 --> 11:03.765
...with me, Quinlan.

11:03.942 --> 11:05.273
You really are...

11:05.443 --> 11:08.344
...going to go fetch me
this angel for Christmas...

11:08.580 --> 11:09.604
...or...

11:10.215 --> 11:11.978
...I fire the two of you...

11:12.283 --> 11:14.217
...and I keep the dog.

11:15.353 --> 11:16.342
Deal.

11:16.521 --> 11:18.785
Need a conference with my colleague.

11:18.957 --> 11:23.018
You cannot live on Fred's salary.
You cannot. That's a deal.

11:23.228 --> 11:26.026
Don't you worry about a thing,
Mr. Malt.

11:26.231 --> 11:28.290
-We'll leave tomorrow.
-Right.

11:28.466 --> 11:29.797
We're taking...

11:29.968 --> 11:31.299
...Sparky with us.

11:31.469 --> 11:32.868
And Miss Winters.

11:33.037 --> 11:34.095
They are?

11:34.305 --> 11:36.296
-Why are we taking her?
-She's an expert.

11:36.474 --> 11:37.372
In what?

11:37.542 --> 11:38.531
Angels.

11:39.444 --> 11:42.242
Miss Winters is an expert in angels.

11:44.983 --> 11:47.144
I have something to tell you.

11:47.885 --> 11:52.322
I won't take care of you anymore.
Your parents will find someone else....

11:53.558 --> 11:54.889
Don't look at me like that.

11:55.760 --> 11:57.455
I have this wonderful new job.

11:57.829 --> 12:02.323
The only problem is, I must pretend
to be an angel expert for a few days.

12:02.900 --> 12:04.367
It'll be fine.

12:04.535 --> 12:05.900
I'll be fine.

12:06.771 --> 12:08.568
And so will you.

12:09.340 --> 12:10.773
Good dogs.

13:06.731 --> 13:09.564
-You've had an encounter with an angel?
-No.

13:09.734 --> 13:10.826
Yes.

13:10.968 --> 13:11.900
Maybe.

13:12.070 --> 13:14.038
-Have you ever met an angel?
-Once.

13:14.339 --> 13:17.900
I got a flat tire on
a deserted country road.

13:18.076 --> 13:20.909
There was no food, no water,
it was 108 degrees...

13:21.079 --> 13:25.345
...and a man in a white robe
suddenly appeared on the horizon...

13:25.483 --> 13:27.781
...with a spare and a jack.

13:27.985 --> 13:28.952
Kidding.

13:29.420 --> 13:30.409
I am.

13:30.588 --> 13:32.146
Bradley used to tease.

13:32.357 --> 13:33.847
Who's Bradley?

13:33.991 --> 13:35.583
My ex-husband.

13:36.160 --> 13:37.752
Better watch it, Quinlan.

13:39.263 --> 13:40.753
We should start over.

13:40.932 --> 13:44.891
When something's going wrong,
it's best to start over. I'll go first.

13:46.003 --> 13:48.164
-Where did you get Sparky?
-Oh, no.

13:48.373 --> 13:50.773
He came up to Huey in a parking lot.

13:50.942 --> 13:53.502
Huey was eating a doughnut,
and was trying to kick him away...

13:54.612 --> 13:56.239
You were trying to kick the dog?

13:58.950 --> 14:03.319
I wasn't trying to kick him. I was
trying to shoo him away very gently.

14:03.621 --> 14:04.610
...when...

14:04.789 --> 14:08.088
...Malt comes out,
sees the dog and stops dead.

14:08.292 --> 14:11.489
Seems Malt was once a child
who'd had a dog just like...

14:11.662 --> 14:12.754
...Sparky.

14:13.030 --> 14:14.793
That's so sweet.

14:15.967 --> 14:16.956
Anyway...

14:17.135 --> 14:18.966
...Malt's eyes get all teary...

14:19.137 --> 14:22.595
...and he pours out this story,
about his dog Sparky...

14:22.807 --> 14:26.004
...which ended up
underneath a tractor tire.

14:27.545 --> 14:29.410
You know what Huey did?

14:29.547 --> 14:32.710
Huey turns to Malt and says,
"Mr. Malt, that's amazing!

14:32.917 --> 14:35.317
"This dog's named Sparky too."

14:38.723 --> 14:41.055
In no time at all, the dog is famous.

14:41.225 --> 14:44.353
Has his own column,
saved Huey's neck 100 times.

14:45.563 --> 14:48.430
Milk Bottle Motel. Here.
Milk Bottle Motel.

16:04.141 --> 16:06.405
Looks like your angel checked out.

16:11.315 --> 16:12.907
Somebody's here.

16:27.031 --> 16:28.589
Mrs. Milbank?

16:32.270 --> 16:35.433
I'm Frank Quinlan
from the National Mirror.

16:36.541 --> 16:38.338
About your letter?

16:40.444 --> 16:43.607
This is my associate,
Mr. Hugh Driscoll.

16:43.781 --> 16:44.839
How are you?

16:45.049 --> 16:48.951
And this is Dorothy Winters,
who is an expert in...

16:49.353 --> 16:50.479
...various things.

16:51.923 --> 16:53.254
And this is...

16:53.457 --> 16:54.424
...Sparky.

17:00.064 --> 17:04.467
You're just as handsome
as in the pictures.

17:05.869 --> 17:07.303
I think he's cold.

17:07.471 --> 17:11.134
-I wouldn't know why not.
-We better get him inside.

17:17.348 --> 17:20.282
Sparky, here you are.

17:22.954 --> 17:25.354
What's that wonderful smell?

17:25.957 --> 17:27.617
You must be baking.

17:33.364 --> 17:36.026
Well, it was nice of you to come.

18:00.825 --> 18:01.723
Don't...

18:01.892 --> 18:03.325
...shake me, Mr. Quinlan.

18:04.061 --> 18:06.427
I'm contemplating my death.

18:06.998 --> 18:08.863
Are you with the angel?

18:14.171 --> 18:16.332
Do you see an angel?

18:17.742 --> 18:19.334
I don't think I do.

18:19.510 --> 18:21.910
Then how could I be with him?

18:22.446 --> 18:26.246
Well, we don't know exactly
how it works with angels.

18:26.417 --> 18:27.850
How it works?

18:29.420 --> 18:32.150
If he's in the room
then you're with him.

18:32.690 --> 18:34.521
If he's somewhere else...

18:34.692 --> 18:36.023
...then you're not.

18:36.193 --> 18:38.684
And that's why we can't see him now?

18:38.863 --> 18:40.057
He's not here.

18:41.032 --> 18:43.159
Are you impaired in some way...

18:43.300 --> 18:45.359
...that I haven't noticed, Miss?

18:46.037 --> 18:47.095
Ms. Winters...

18:47.271 --> 18:51.435
...has probably never heard of
an angel living in a motel.

18:52.943 --> 18:54.808
You think I'm full of shit.

18:55.112 --> 18:57.444
No, no. Nothing like that.

18:57.615 --> 19:01.779
I don't judge these things.
I don't decide what's real or not.

19:01.952 --> 19:06.719
-I've seen too many things myself.
-We heard of a werewolf in S. Jersey.

19:06.891 --> 19:09.985
-We went there.
-To locate the werewolf.

19:10.394 --> 19:12.419
In that particular case...

19:12.797 --> 19:17.734
...that person was convinced that
the werewolf was in the room with us.

19:17.902 --> 19:20.962
They could see it,
although Mr. Quinlan and myself....

19:21.138 --> 19:24.403
We couldn't, but that
doesn't mean it wasn't there.

19:24.742 --> 19:26.141
Michael?

19:28.579 --> 19:30.809
Are you coming down, dear?

19:30.981 --> 19:31.970
Yeah.

19:32.983 --> 19:34.007
Be right down.

19:34.819 --> 19:37.310
Just got to find my smokes.

19:38.089 --> 19:41.252
They're beside the bed,
next to my cortisone.

19:41.592 --> 19:43.526
Did you find them?

19:43.828 --> 19:46.194
He'll be down directly.

19:47.865 --> 19:50.163
That smell is so familiar.

19:50.501 --> 19:52.594
It's like something from childhood.

20:04.381 --> 20:06.110
Oh, God.

20:32.710 --> 20:36.976
Michael, look who's come to visit us!
It's Sparky.

20:51.328 --> 20:52.556
How do you do?

21:11.382 --> 21:13.942
You'll have to excuse Michael.

21:14.351 --> 21:16.819
He's not good at suffering fools...

21:17.021 --> 21:19.581
...but he'll be better in the morning.

21:49.954 --> 21:52.115
Where is the thermostat in here?

21:52.289 --> 21:54.382
Are we talking about an angel here?

21:54.558 --> 21:57.220
-We can't be talking about an angel.
-There is no such....

21:57.461 --> 21:59.395
...thing as an angel.

21:59.563 --> 22:00.894
That is definitely...

22:01.065 --> 22:05.126
...the weirdest thing I have ever seen.
It's like some great big bird...

22:05.302 --> 22:08.794
-...made love to that guy's mother.
-And we reap the benefits.

22:08.973 --> 22:11.305
I'm set for life.
I could even get a raise.

22:11.408 --> 22:13.740
I thank you. Thank you, Jesus.

22:13.911 --> 22:16.311
Thank you, Jesus. I thank you, Jesus.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.311
I thank you, Jesus.

22:26.824 --> 22:28.985
-What?
-That is not an angel.

22:29.159 --> 22:31.753
-It is too.
-It is not.

22:34.265 --> 22:35.994
I will handle this.

22:38.168 --> 22:40.102
Where has he been?

22:40.271 --> 22:43.331
-Meaning what?
-Meaning if he were a man with wings...

22:43.507 --> 22:46.670
...which is the alternative,
we'd have heard about him.

22:46.844 --> 22:51.178
You don't show up at his age with wings.
There'd be a story in the papers.

22:51.348 --> 22:55.114
-In the National Mirror.
-Exactly. "Baby born with wings."

22:55.286 --> 22:56.844
"Bird-man of Iowa."

22:57.021 --> 23:01.287
It's not angel vs. man with wings.
There are other possibilities.

23:01.458 --> 23:02.948
Like what?

23:03.127 --> 23:05.789
It's fairly obvious, isn't it?

23:06.530 --> 23:10.864
He's a younger man. She's an
older woman. He's after her money.

23:11.035 --> 23:13.469
A gigolo with wings.

23:13.637 --> 23:14.501
A gigolo.

23:14.672 --> 23:18.802
What money is he after?
The Milk Bottle Motel fortune?

23:18.976 --> 23:22.969
You don't have to have money
for someone to try to take it.

23:23.547 --> 23:25.708
Oh, Lord. Oh, Lord.

23:25.883 --> 23:27.578
Is it so hard to imagine...

23:27.818 --> 23:31.049
...that a man would be
after a woman's money?

23:31.322 --> 23:34.382
Is this Brightly? Or Brinkley?
What's his name?

23:34.558 --> 23:36.549
-Bradley.
-Is this him we're talking about?

23:36.727 --> 23:39.059
-Actually, no. It's Miles.
-Who's Miles?

23:39.229 --> 23:40.992
My second husband.

23:42.166 --> 23:44.498
Miles was wild. It lasted a week.

23:44.668 --> 23:45.828
You left him?

23:46.003 --> 23:48.665
No, he left me, in my Camaro.

23:51.408 --> 23:52.397
I see.

23:52.576 --> 23:57.070
I'll bet he racked up $5,000 on your
Visa bill too, didn't he? Didn't he?

23:57.247 --> 23:59.511
You just know everything, don't you?

24:01.418 --> 24:03.181
Angels don't smoke.

24:04.855 --> 24:06.254
I'm going to sleep.

24:06.423 --> 24:07.685
Good night.

24:11.595 --> 24:13.586
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

24:13.764 --> 24:15.857
That is a horrible expression.

24:16.867 --> 24:18.357
It is not...

24:18.535 --> 24:20.696
...an expression.

24:54.605 --> 24:56.072
That's good.

24:58.075 --> 24:59.633
He's so hungry.

25:01.311 --> 25:02.403
Oh, boy.

25:08.318 --> 25:09.808
Good boy.

25:10.754 --> 25:13.154
What a sweet doggie.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.194
How would you like
your eggs, Mr. Quinlan?

25:19.596 --> 25:21.427
Sparky's look good.

25:21.598 --> 25:23.327
Over easy!

25:38.615 --> 25:41.448
Last night we were
discussing your wings.

25:41.618 --> 25:43.882
Would you mind if I took a closer look?

25:45.122 --> 25:49.616
Let them look at your wings, Michael.
They're from the National Mirror.

25:49.793 --> 25:50.851
Thank you.

25:53.197 --> 25:55.131
-Not bad.
-Compared to what?

25:55.299 --> 25:58.530
-I've seen birds.
-Would you mind if I touched?

26:00.204 --> 26:01.694
I'd rather you didn't.

26:04.141 --> 26:08.544
We'd like to take a look to see
how you have these things attached.

26:08.712 --> 26:11.545
Pull on your pecker and
see how that's attached.

26:11.715 --> 26:14.047
Watch your language, mister.

26:14.218 --> 26:16.982
Pecker. An angel that says pecker.

26:17.154 --> 26:18.382
Language...

26:18.555 --> 26:19.817
...gentlemen.

26:20.557 --> 26:22.491
How would you like your eggs?

26:22.659 --> 26:25.651
What's in the oven?
The smell is so delicious.

26:25.829 --> 26:28.491
We are serving eggs
this morning and that's that.

26:28.665 --> 26:31.225
Over easy would be just fine.

26:31.401 --> 26:33.062
Over easy!

26:34.738 --> 26:36.262
I thought angels were...

26:37.074 --> 26:38.234
...cleaner.

26:39.009 --> 26:41.739
She doesn't mean to offend. It's....

26:42.079 --> 26:46.072
Miss Winters is an angel
expert and she gets kind of...

26:46.250 --> 26:49.276
...literal. What she
probably wants to know is...

26:51.255 --> 26:53.018
-...can you fly?
-I don't...

26:53.190 --> 26:57.286
...want to know if he can fly.
He can't. Only little angels--

26:57.528 --> 26:58.859
Says who?

26:59.029 --> 27:00.519
I just thought....

27:00.898 --> 27:03.025
Halos? Inner light?

27:04.535 --> 27:06.867
I'm not that kind of angel.

27:07.037 --> 27:10.871
-What kind of angel are you?
-Michael is an archangel.

27:11.041 --> 27:14.943
He battled Lucifer and
threw him out of Heaven.

27:15.445 --> 27:17.208
Revelation Twelve, verse seven.

27:17.381 --> 27:18.939
That was a long time ago.

27:19.116 --> 27:22.210
He smote a bank for me.

27:22.819 --> 27:25.379
-A bank?
-I knew it. Money was involved, right?

27:25.956 --> 27:28.390
I should say so.

27:28.559 --> 27:30.459
-After Elmer died....
-Who's Elmer?

27:30.727 --> 27:32.786
My husband. After he died...

27:32.963 --> 27:36.990
...they built the highway
and stole all my truckers.

27:37.467 --> 27:39.059
And then the bank...

27:39.236 --> 27:40.294
...came to...

27:40.470 --> 27:42.563
...take the Milk Bottle...

27:42.739 --> 27:44.798
...and I prayed for help...

27:46.076 --> 27:48.636
...until God sent me Michael.

27:48.812 --> 27:50.575
She was persistent.

27:50.747 --> 27:51.805
You came...

27:51.982 --> 27:54.143
...down and smote the bank?

27:54.318 --> 27:57.082
A branch. First Iowa Bank of Commerce.

27:57.254 --> 28:00.951
It was lovely. He walked into
the manager's office and said....

28:01.425 --> 28:03.825
-What was that you said?
-Money changer!

28:03.994 --> 28:06.087
"Money changer...

28:06.263 --> 28:10.825
"...I shall turneth this earthly den
into a parking lot."

28:11.602 --> 28:13.593
Did I say that? I didn't say that.

28:13.770 --> 28:17.501
They didn't believe us,
so Michael flattened it.

28:17.674 --> 28:19.005
-You did that?
-Had to.

28:19.176 --> 28:21.610
Into a parking lot?

28:21.845 --> 28:24.609
Well, they said it was a tornado.

28:26.016 --> 28:30.783
This town doesn't really need
a parking lot, but it's more...

28:30.954 --> 28:32.785
...cosmopolitan.

28:33.957 --> 28:35.356
And what about the money?

28:35.525 --> 28:38.187
We never heard another word about it.
Did we?

28:38.362 --> 28:39.454
Nope.

28:40.130 --> 28:41.290
You look like...

28:41.465 --> 28:43.956
...you must eat a robust breakfast.

28:44.134 --> 28:46.193
How would you like your eggs?

28:49.473 --> 28:50.804
Poached?

28:52.309 --> 28:54.300
That's.... Poached is fine.

28:54.478 --> 28:56.139
Poached.

29:15.399 --> 29:18.391
"The Lord is my shepherd,
I shall not want.

29:18.568 --> 29:21.401
"He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.

29:21.571 --> 29:24.165
"He leadeth me beside
the still waters...."

29:24.841 --> 29:28.242
Look, she's happier
where she is, right?

29:29.579 --> 29:30.739
Heaven?

29:32.249 --> 29:34.012
She's happier up there?

29:34.251 --> 29:36.412
It isn't my area.

29:43.593 --> 29:45.754
You hardly knew her.

29:45.929 --> 29:48.591
She died cooking us breakfast.

29:51.535 --> 29:53.526
She died making breakfast.

30:00.610 --> 30:04.102
What is it that you keep
writing in that book?

30:04.548 --> 30:05.879
Lyrics.

30:06.883 --> 30:08.111
To what?

30:08.385 --> 30:10.376
I write Country Western songs.

30:10.554 --> 30:12.283
It's my hobby.

30:13.623 --> 30:15.113
"Earth to earth...

30:15.459 --> 30:17.290
"...ashes to ashes...

30:18.395 --> 30:20.124
"...and dust to dust.

30:21.131 --> 30:22.792
"The Lord bless and keep you...

30:22.966 --> 30:24.490
"...and give you peace."

30:24.668 --> 30:27.637
Justine? It's Quinlan.
Put me straight through.

30:27.804 --> 30:29.237
What you got?

30:29.573 --> 30:30.972
Wings.

30:31.141 --> 30:32.574
Real wings.

30:32.743 --> 30:34.301
Don't play with me, Quinlan.

30:34.478 --> 30:37.413
This guy is about six feet tall.

30:37.581 --> 30:41.574
He has wings from his shoulders
to his knees. But he's filthy.

30:41.752 --> 30:44.653
We'll have to clean him
and put him in a white robe.

30:44.821 --> 30:49.588
Get Craddock to dig up those sandals
with the straps that go up your legs.

30:49.760 --> 30:51.318
Too bad he's not blond.

30:51.495 --> 30:53.326
Angels are supposed to be blond.

30:53.497 --> 30:56.591
But "Oprah," Barbara,
"The Today Show..."

30:56.767 --> 30:58.598
"...Hard Copy," book the works.

30:58.769 --> 31:00.430
Don't mess this one up.

31:00.604 --> 31:03.767
I want that guy
on the first plane to Chicago.

31:03.940 --> 31:05.805
Or does the bird-man fly himself?

31:06.176 --> 31:09.612
I don't know if he actually
uses the wings, but God...

31:09.780 --> 31:11.145
...wouldn't that be a draw?

31:11.782 --> 31:14.273
Don't worry. He's in safe hands.

31:14.451 --> 31:16.180
And I'm the Queen of England.

31:16.353 --> 31:18.446
Don't fret, Malt.

31:21.024 --> 31:22.616
He's in safe hands.

31:22.793 --> 31:25.523
In view of this,
should we call the girl off?

31:25.695 --> 31:28.186
No, no, leave her where she is.

31:28.365 --> 31:30.856
I'm in a no-lose situation.

31:41.244 --> 31:42.438
Hey, Mike.

31:42.579 --> 31:43.944
Michael.

31:48.452 --> 31:50.079
Have you...

31:50.454 --> 31:53.446
...ever seen the world's
biggest ball of twine?

31:54.090 --> 31:55.182
No.

31:55.859 --> 31:56.951
We must go--

31:57.360 --> 32:01.057
I saw the world's biggest cannonball.
Mesopotamia.

32:01.531 --> 32:05.262
-I wonder if it's still there.
-Mesopotamia isn't still there.

32:05.469 --> 32:07.334
-Nothing lasts.
-Listen....

32:08.271 --> 32:10.364
I have to ask a favor.

32:10.974 --> 32:14.967
Huey and l, we're on a little
bit of a losing streak.

32:15.111 --> 32:16.373
Quit.

32:16.980 --> 32:21.041
We can't. He's got a mortgage.
Three kids in a soccer camp.

32:21.218 --> 32:22.378
A wife.

32:22.552 --> 32:23.883
God knows he loves her...

32:24.054 --> 32:26.989
...but she's burning a hole
in his pocket, and l....

32:28.992 --> 32:29.890
Well....

32:30.060 --> 32:32.790
Love to fight. Like me. We'll drive.

32:33.296 --> 32:34.228
Where?

32:34.397 --> 32:36.627
Chicago. Isn't that
where you want to go?

32:37.734 --> 32:39.793
I know. That's why I wrote you.

32:40.003 --> 32:41.129
You wrote?

32:41.304 --> 32:42.794
Yeah. My idea.

32:44.508 --> 32:46.305
Why are we driving?

32:46.910 --> 32:51.813
I mean, why don't we fly?
All of us together in a plane.

32:52.816 --> 32:56.013
It's safer. Much safer.
Nobody believes it...

32:56.253 --> 32:58.517
...but statistically it's true...

32:59.022 --> 33:00.819
-...and the paper'll pay.
-Nope.

33:01.024 --> 33:03.254
-We need time.
-Time for what?

33:03.426 --> 33:04.415
Smokes.

33:04.594 --> 33:06.755
Smokes. Besides...

33:06.930 --> 33:10.525
...I'll get to see the world's
largest ball of twine.

33:11.268 --> 33:12.599
-It's on the way.
-Great.

33:12.769 --> 33:15.101
-You'll owe me something.
-Money?

33:15.272 --> 33:20.039
I can't quote a figure, but there'll be
plenty of money, I promise you that...

33:20.176 --> 33:21.541
...once the world sees...

33:21.678 --> 33:23.908
-...pictures of these babies.
-No.

33:24.347 --> 33:27.908
-You'll owe me an apology.
-An apology, for what?

33:28.184 --> 33:30.049
Sure, I apologize. Whatever.

33:30.186 --> 33:32.347
Not now. When I say so.

33:32.556 --> 33:33.853
And no pictures.

33:34.057 --> 33:36.548
No pictures? Are you kidding me?

33:36.693 --> 33:38.684
Not until we get to Chicago.

33:39.629 --> 33:40.687
Deal?

33:41.464 --> 33:42.556
Deal.

33:51.308 --> 33:53.071
I like your coat better.

33:53.209 --> 33:54.642
It's yours.

34:18.101 --> 34:21.228
The world's biggest ball
of twine is two hours from here.

34:21.404 --> 34:24.100
I'd like to see it before the sun sets.

34:24.239 --> 34:28.176
-They'll exploit you. You must know.
-I'm going.

34:28.344 --> 34:30.905
Well I'm not. For your sake.

34:31.114 --> 34:34.641
You are or I'll have to tell
them the truth about you.

34:34.851 --> 34:35.840
What?

34:36.252 --> 34:37.844
I know why you're here...

34:38.021 --> 34:40.853
...and it has nothing to do with angels.

34:41.024 --> 34:42.616
How do you know?

34:44.027 --> 34:45.755
I pay attention.

34:54.536 --> 34:55.435
Also...

34:55.639 --> 34:57.266
-...I'd like you to sing.
-A song?

34:57.440 --> 34:58.372
Of course.

34:59.275 --> 35:00.537
Fine.

35:00.710 --> 35:02.143
I'll sing.

35:02.646 --> 35:03.943
Now?

35:04.547 --> 35:05.946
When I tell you to.

36:11.715 --> 36:13.012
In the national news:

36:13.216 --> 36:17.619
Hog futures are down 1/4 in Chicago
and selling down 1/8 in Sioux City.

36:17.787 --> 36:19.220
Hog futures.

36:26.429 --> 36:28.420
Hog futures are down 1/4.

36:30.967 --> 36:33.026
-What's the opposite of white?
-Black.

36:33.236 --> 36:34.965
Wrong. Yolk.

36:41.244 --> 36:43.144
Is that like an egg joke?

36:43.313 --> 36:46.874
When we stop to eat will
you put your coat back on?

36:47.050 --> 36:49.041
-Why?
-Your wings.

36:49.252 --> 36:50.810
People will see your wings.

36:50.987 --> 36:53.547
Are you afraid they'll
think less of you?

36:56.159 --> 36:58.059
They won't know what to think.

36:58.261 --> 37:01.492
Many people aren't
as sophisticated as me and Huey.

37:02.398 --> 37:05.561
We don't want any trouble.
We want to get to Chicago.

37:06.536 --> 37:09.198
He's worried somebody might
try to steal his story.

37:09.405 --> 37:11.498
-I'm not worried.
-You're worried.

37:12.809 --> 37:14.401
Look what Pansy left us.

37:14.577 --> 37:16.306
Car Bingo.

37:16.846 --> 37:18.837
Dig the propaganda.

37:19.082 --> 37:23.576
"The miles will fly and your
children won't cry if you play...

37:23.787 --> 37:25.084
"...Car Bingo."

37:25.288 --> 37:27.518
All right. Everybody gets one.

37:27.690 --> 37:29.021
Here. Hand them out.

37:29.192 --> 37:31.683
-What do we do?
-Here are the pencils.

37:32.428 --> 37:35.226
Instead of writing a number
you write what you see.

37:37.367 --> 37:38.857
Dog. One point for me.

37:39.035 --> 37:42.869
-Not fair! You played this before.
-Not fair to me, I'm driving.

37:43.039 --> 37:44.802
Deal with it. Bird on a wire.

37:44.941 --> 37:46.533
-Picket fence.
-Policeman.

37:46.709 --> 37:48.040
Where?

37:55.318 --> 37:56.717
That was good.

37:59.455 --> 38:00.945
You must learn to laugh.

38:01.124 --> 38:02.557
It's the way to true love.

38:31.321 --> 38:33.482
"The world's largest ball of twine...

38:33.656 --> 38:36.591
-"...has a circumference of 45 ft...."
-What's the excuse?

38:36.759 --> 38:40.354
It'll take longer because
we must stay off the highway.

38:40.496 --> 38:41.485
Fly.

38:41.664 --> 38:43.359
-He won't fly.
-Why?

38:43.499 --> 38:46.866
He can't fit in coach. His wings
take too much space.

38:47.036 --> 38:48.435
You'll pay first class?

38:48.605 --> 38:49.663
Drive.

38:49.839 --> 38:53.002
"...it was transported here.
There's enough twine...."

39:01.184 --> 39:02.515
Battle.

39:08.758 --> 39:10.783
Don't worry. What can happen?

39:10.960 --> 39:12.518
Trust me. Nothing.

39:13.763 --> 39:15.628
Don't fret, Malt.

39:21.537 --> 39:24.131
What are you doing?

39:32.215 --> 39:33.648
Battle!

39:49.332 --> 39:50.822
You know what that is?

39:52.235 --> 39:53.566
Battle.

40:02.245 --> 40:03.678
Michael, don't.

40:32.542 --> 40:35.272
I am completely happy.

40:35.611 --> 40:38.603
Are you all right?
Can you feel your legs.

40:41.384 --> 40:45.218
No injuries. Six thousand
three hundred and sixty battles.

40:45.688 --> 40:46.916
Can you sit up?

40:47.123 --> 40:49.114
Of course I can sit up.

40:53.229 --> 40:54.628
Now, that...

40:54.797 --> 40:56.731
...that is my nature.

40:57.900 --> 41:02.132
But I'm doomed to live in one place
and crave the pleasures of another.

41:02.305 --> 41:04.637
But don't you feel sorry for me.

41:04.807 --> 41:06.297
Why would we?

41:06.509 --> 41:11.139
Because this is my last blast. 26.
That's all we get. Thank you, Quinlan.

41:11.581 --> 41:12.639
For what?

41:12.815 --> 41:16.012
I think he's saying
there's no sex in Heaven.

41:16.152 --> 41:21.021
It's not polite to talk about someone in
the third person when the person's here.

41:21.157 --> 41:23.091
I know. I'm very sorry. Sparky!

41:23.259 --> 41:24.817
What do you mean...

41:26.029 --> 41:28.088
...last blast?

41:28.431 --> 41:30.456
Only so many visits allowed.

41:33.669 --> 41:36.832
I'm going to miss everything so much.

41:49.285 --> 41:50.411
Why are you here?

41:51.521 --> 41:54.354
Why are you saying it has
anything to do with me?

41:59.295 --> 42:03.322
The Sun had an argument with the North
Wind. Who was smarter? Stronger?

42:03.499 --> 42:06.093
The North Wind pointed out
a man walking down the street.

42:06.302 --> 42:08.793
"I can make that man
take his coat off and you can't."

42:08.971 --> 42:12.463
"I'll take that bet," said the Sun.
The North Wind blew and the more...

42:12.642 --> 42:15.805
...that wind blew, the tighter that
man held that coat around himself.

42:16.379 --> 42:17.710
And then the Sun...

42:17.880 --> 42:19.472
...came out and smiled...

42:19.649 --> 42:21.207
...and it became warmer, and...

42:21.384 --> 42:23.147
...the man took off his coat.

42:28.591 --> 42:31.583
What is that supposed to mean?

42:31.727 --> 42:36.096
-Did you make a bet about me?
-I had to get back here somehow.

42:36.232 --> 42:38.393
Watch the wings there, buddy.

42:59.622 --> 43:01.522
That's not how you eat a lemon.

43:02.125 --> 43:03.820
How do you eat a lemon?

43:05.528 --> 43:06.893
You cut it in half...

43:08.431 --> 43:10.922
-...put salt on it.
-That's how you eat a lemon.

43:11.134 --> 43:13.932
-That is how you eat a lemon.
-What is this, a rule?

43:18.040 --> 43:19.530
Hey, you too.

43:24.147 --> 43:26.377
-Thank you.
-Do you have pie?

43:30.219 --> 43:31.880
Do you have pie?

43:43.166 --> 43:44.531
I'm a writer too.

43:44.700 --> 43:46.565
Really. What did you write?

43:46.736 --> 43:48.169
Psalm eighty-five.

43:49.705 --> 43:52.401
It wasn't called Psalm 85
when I wrote it.

43:52.575 --> 43:55.373
I didn't know they'd be
collected and numbered.

44:03.920 --> 44:07.185
That was around the time
I invented standing in line.

44:07.323 --> 44:09.188
You invented standing in line?

44:09.325 --> 44:11.885
Before everybody milled around.
It was a mess.

44:12.328 --> 44:14.990
So one day I said,
"Why not make a line?"

44:15.198 --> 44:16.130
For what?

44:16.832 --> 44:18.197
To get in.

44:18.334 --> 44:21.326
-Ask him what you want to know.
-What do I want to know?

44:21.504 --> 44:24.268
He wants to know why angels
don't solve big problems.

44:24.440 --> 44:25.998
That is what I want to know.

44:26.209 --> 44:27.437
Why don't angels...

44:27.610 --> 44:29.009
...solve big problems?

44:30.346 --> 44:33.110
You can't change
the nature of the world.

44:33.282 --> 44:34.715
What can you do?

44:34.850 --> 44:36.977
Small miracles, only so many.

44:37.720 --> 44:39.847
Some angels aren't so smart.

44:40.022 --> 44:43.014
-They use them up in stupid ways.
-Like the parking...

44:43.226 --> 44:44.284
...space angel.

44:45.261 --> 44:47.252
I don't like to criticize other angels.

44:51.133 --> 44:53.101
I'll be with you in a minute.

44:57.306 --> 44:59.866
This is how you eat a lemon.

45:03.846 --> 45:04.972
Excuse me.

45:05.248 --> 45:06.340
They want me.

45:07.483 --> 45:10.247
-Remember what John and Paul said.
-The Apostles?

45:10.386 --> 45:11.717
No, the Beatles.

45:11.887 --> 45:13.650
"All you need is love."

45:14.490 --> 45:16.390
Hello there, ladies.

45:24.066 --> 45:25.499
Do you believe in angels?

45:25.668 --> 45:26.760
Absolutely.

45:26.902 --> 45:29.894
Have you ever heard of an angel
that was interested in sex?

45:30.072 --> 45:31.164
Of course not.

45:31.340 --> 45:33.069
Angels do not have sex.

45:33.276 --> 45:34.903
-But is there one?
-I suppose...

45:35.077 --> 45:37.170
...he invented standing in line.

45:39.015 --> 45:41.074
I'm going to take you for a walk.

45:42.885 --> 45:43.874
Let's go.

45:56.532 --> 45:58.363
Suzanne, what's going on?

47:29.191 --> 47:30.488
Follow me, ladies.

47:31.460 --> 47:32.791
Follow me.

47:55.618 --> 47:58.178
I invented the hole in the coffee cup.

47:58.921 --> 48:00.912
When you get coffee to go.

48:01.991 --> 48:05.722
I was the first person to rip
the little hole in the lid...

48:05.928 --> 48:07.555
...so you could drink it in the car.

48:07.830 --> 48:10.230
-Could've made a fortune.
-It's weird.

48:10.433 --> 48:13.163
-What?
-She's an angel expert, but--

48:13.335 --> 48:14.427
What?

48:17.072 --> 48:18.437
Battle.

48:27.450 --> 48:28.883
For God's sake, Michael...

48:29.084 --> 48:30.176
...stop.

48:47.970 --> 48:50.871
-Battle.
-You better believe it.

49:19.101 --> 49:21.228
It's caramels. He smell like caramels.

49:21.403 --> 49:22.734
It's cotton candy.

49:22.905 --> 49:27.706
He smells like cookies. The smell
gets stronger when he's in heat.

50:02.678 --> 50:04.669
You are a great fighter.

50:04.847 --> 50:06.041
Certainly am.

50:06.282 --> 50:07.442
I'm cold.

50:09.184 --> 50:10.947
You from the National Mirror?

50:11.120 --> 50:12.610
I got a 2-headed chicken...

50:12.788 --> 50:14.551
...if you're interested.

50:14.690 --> 50:15.952
What are we held for?

50:16.358 --> 50:18.690
Destruction of property, assault...

50:18.861 --> 50:21.455
...disturbing the peace.
The Magistrate...

50:21.630 --> 50:23.188
...will be here in the morning.

50:23.365 --> 50:25.629
-I had nothing to do with this.
-'Night.

50:27.136 --> 50:29.297
We have a phone call coming to us.

50:45.087 --> 50:49.649
Ralph got thrown in jail, but at least
he had the decency to keep me out of it.

50:49.825 --> 50:51.884
I don't want to spend the night here.

50:52.094 --> 50:53.322
I hate you.

50:53.495 --> 50:54.894
What? You hate me?

50:55.097 --> 50:56.655
-Not you.
-You hate me?

50:56.832 --> 50:59.164
-Not you.
-Process of elimination.

50:59.335 --> 51:00.666
Who's Ralph?

51:00.836 --> 51:02.497
Another...

51:02.671 --> 51:04.104
...husband...

51:04.673 --> 51:06.004
...has popped up.

51:06.175 --> 51:07.836
Maybe Sparky can get us out.

51:11.680 --> 51:13.739
Go in the drawer and get the key.

51:18.821 --> 51:20.550
Go in the drawer...

51:20.723 --> 51:22.714
...and get the key.

51:25.060 --> 51:26.618
Dorothy can make him do it.

51:27.429 --> 51:30.626
Dorothy's good with dogs.
I have noticed this.

51:30.766 --> 51:32.927
Dogs don't talk.

51:34.436 --> 51:35.698
They don't shave.

51:36.038 --> 51:38.768
They don't run off in your Camaro.

51:40.142 --> 51:43.942
When you want them to take
a bath, you make an appointment.

51:44.146 --> 51:45.773
Sit. Stay.

51:45.948 --> 51:47.279
Roll over.

51:51.220 --> 51:52.380
Now.

51:54.790 --> 51:55.779
What?

51:55.958 --> 51:57.289
Apologize.

51:57.793 --> 51:59.260
Say you're sorry.

51:59.461 --> 52:00.723
To her?

52:01.063 --> 52:02.257
Be serious.

52:03.465 --> 52:04.557
Or...

52:04.733 --> 52:06.963
...l am not going to....

52:07.202 --> 52:08.464
"Chicago...

52:08.671 --> 52:09.899
"...Chicago...

52:10.072 --> 52:13.200
"...that toddling town,
that toddling town

52:13.409 --> 52:14.671
"Chicago...

52:14.810 --> 52:15.742
"...Chicago

52:15.911 --> 52:18.072
"I'll show you around

52:18.247 --> 52:20.078
"You'll love it"

52:23.585 --> 52:24.711
Sorry.

52:45.441 --> 52:46.772
I'm sorry.

52:50.512 --> 52:51.843
I'm sorry.

52:56.285 --> 52:57.843
I didn't mean it.

53:13.969 --> 53:15.129
You cold?

53:19.041 --> 53:21.134
Here, take my blanket, okay?

53:40.662 --> 53:42.391
I'm going to sleep.

53:44.500 --> 53:45.762
Me too.

54:40.823 --> 54:42.950
All rise, all rise.

54:43.125 --> 54:47.061
Bickel County Court is in session,
Hon. Judge Esther Newberg presiding.

54:47.229 --> 54:48.628
Please rise.

54:54.570 --> 54:55.901
Be seated.

54:58.640 --> 54:59.572
Now...

55:00.409 --> 55:02.240
...you are charged with...

55:02.411 --> 55:05.141
...disturbing the peace,
destruction of property.

55:05.347 --> 55:06.575
$1,200 worth.

55:06.748 --> 55:07.976
I spoke to Jenny.

55:08.150 --> 55:09.583
Who's...

55:09.852 --> 55:11.479
-...Jenny?
-That's his wife.

55:11.653 --> 55:14.087
That sweet painting above the bar...

55:14.256 --> 55:17.987
"...Two Moose Hunters in a Canoe,"
smashed to smithereens.

55:18.160 --> 55:19.491
That is so sad.

55:20.095 --> 55:22.757
-Isn't this a conflict of interest?
-Did I say...

55:22.931 --> 55:24.228
...you could speak?

55:26.969 --> 55:29.904
I know someone who restores
paintings. I said:

55:30.105 --> 55:32.596
"Stop crying, I'll take care of it."

55:32.774 --> 55:35.937
Who can tell me exactly
what happened...

55:36.111 --> 55:37.169
...last night?

55:37.379 --> 55:38.676
I can.

55:39.114 --> 55:41.173
-Anyone else?
-We were having dinner.

55:41.383 --> 55:43.010
-Not you.
-If I may.

55:43.185 --> 55:44.675
Put your hand down.

55:45.954 --> 55:47.012
You.

55:47.189 --> 55:48.156
Please.

55:49.524 --> 55:50.957
In chambers.

55:52.628 --> 55:54.186
All rise, all rise.

55:54.396 --> 55:57.058
The court of Bickel County,
Judge Esther Newberg presiding...

55:57.299 --> 55:58.698
...is now in recess.

55:58.901 --> 56:00.300
Please rise.

56:15.617 --> 56:19.280
"Love, love, love

56:21.723 --> 56:25.659
"Love, love, love

56:27.629 --> 56:30.564
"Love, love, love

56:31.867 --> 56:33.562
"It's easy

56:34.436 --> 56:36.836
"All you need is love

56:38.440 --> 56:40.840
"All you need is love

56:42.344 --> 56:44.574
"All you need is love, love

56:46.248 --> 56:48.079
"Love is all you need

56:48.250 --> 56:51.947
"There's nothing you can
know that isn't known

56:52.087 --> 56:55.454
"There's no one you can save
that can't be saved

56:55.590 --> 56:57.524
"Nothing you sing can't be sung

56:57.693 --> 56:59.957
"But you can learn how to play the game

57:00.095 --> 57:01.960
"It's easy

57:02.097 --> 57:04.861
"All you need is love"

57:05.267 --> 57:06.529
Come on, sing.

57:06.702 --> 57:08.192
"All you need is love"

57:08.370 --> 57:10.361
Not you. Not yet.

57:10.539 --> 57:11.870
"All you need is love"

57:12.040 --> 57:13.200
Just the guys.

57:13.375 --> 57:14.467
Come on, fellas.

57:14.609 --> 57:15.974
"Love is all you need

57:16.111 --> 57:18.045
-"Love is all you need"
-Bring it down.

57:34.629 --> 57:36.062
Wait a minute. Wait.

57:36.231 --> 57:37.994
-Meadsboro, one mile.
-So?

57:38.500 --> 57:42.300
That's where the world's largest
non-stick frying pan is.

57:42.504 --> 57:47.237
We are not stopping to see the
world's largest non-stick frying pan.

57:47.409 --> 57:49.900
-Why not?
-Because we have to get back.

57:50.145 --> 57:52.238
Me too. But before that happens...

57:52.414 --> 57:55.645
...I'd like to see the largest
non-stick frying pan.

57:55.817 --> 57:58.911
-It is on the way.
-When we stop, he gets us in trouble.

57:59.087 --> 58:01.055
He also gets us out of trouble.

58:02.424 --> 58:04.654
What? Well, he does.

58:04.826 --> 58:07.761
That judge just took
one look at him and....

58:07.929 --> 58:09.089
What is that?

58:09.264 --> 58:11.425
What is it about you?

58:12.601 --> 58:14.933
As a woman, could you explain that?

58:15.103 --> 58:18.595
How should I know? I'm not
the least bit attracted to him.

58:18.774 --> 58:21.538
-No offense, but I'm not.
-I put a block on you.

58:21.676 --> 58:23.610
-Sure.
-I did.

58:23.779 --> 58:24.768
All right.

58:24.946 --> 58:26.106
To continue.

58:26.782 --> 58:29.842
"Presumably, this frying pan
was coated...

58:30.052 --> 58:31.952
"...with Teflon to save a wee bit...

58:32.120 --> 58:35.612
"...on the amount of cholesterol
ingested by the town of Meadsboro...

58:35.791 --> 58:37.622
"...when they get together to honor...

58:37.793 --> 58:39.124
-"...the egg."
-We're not stopping.

58:39.294 --> 58:41.785
You have 10 seconds
to change your mind.

58:42.697 --> 58:44.130
Ten hippopotamus...

58:44.299 --> 58:45.857
...nine hippopotamus...

58:46.802 --> 58:50.704
How much more attractive is he
than I am? Be honest with me.

58:50.872 --> 58:52.464
Huey, this is not healthy.

58:52.641 --> 58:54.302
...five hippopotamus...

58:54.576 --> 58:56.305
...four hippopotamus...

58:56.478 --> 58:57.706
...three, two, one!

59:27.876 --> 59:30.504
No jack. Of course there is no jack.

59:30.679 --> 59:34.843
Just ask him to fix it.
He blew it. He can fix it.

59:35.016 --> 59:37.348
Come back here and fix this tire.

59:39.187 --> 59:41.018
No can do.

59:54.536 --> 59:56.766
I miss my wife.

59:57.272 --> 59:59.536
I don't miss any of my husbands.

01:00:00.208 --> 01:00:03.666
Although Bradley was handy with a jack.
He had to be.

01:00:04.446 --> 01:00:06.380
I don't want to ask why.

01:00:06.715 --> 01:00:08.945
His tires were bald.

01:00:15.457 --> 01:00:19.086
His tires were bald, so was his head.

01:00:20.562 --> 01:00:23.360
I wish he'd called, but now he's dead.

01:00:25.967 --> 01:00:28.094
He's not dead, he wasn't bald.

01:00:29.237 --> 01:00:30.864
Poetic license.

01:00:31.239 --> 01:00:33.298
"His tires were bald...

01:00:33.808 --> 01:00:35.673
"...and they went flat

01:00:36.578 --> 01:00:37.909
"So did our love...

01:00:38.079 --> 01:00:40.809
"...and that was that"

01:00:45.053 --> 01:00:47.487
Maybe you could write
a song about my wife.

01:00:47.689 --> 01:00:48.986
Do you love her?

01:00:51.826 --> 01:00:54.192
Yeah, she drives me wild.

01:00:54.596 --> 01:00:55.927
What about her?

01:00:59.201 --> 01:01:00.759
She had her lips done.

01:01:01.603 --> 01:01:03.833
Had little bits of fat...

01:01:04.005 --> 01:01:05.597
...squeezed into them.

01:01:06.208 --> 01:01:08.938
Now my wife has lips like a blowfish.

01:01:09.844 --> 01:01:11.334
But in a good way.

01:01:14.282 --> 01:01:18.446
"My wife has lips like a blowfish"

01:01:21.022 --> 01:01:23.456
I don't see it, but I could be wrong.

01:01:23.625 --> 01:01:28.119
If I had any talent as a Country
singer, I wouldn't be sitting here.

01:01:35.804 --> 01:01:40.298
"Sitting on the side of the road
in the middle of nowhere"

01:01:42.310 --> 01:01:44.642
Sounds awfully familiar.

01:01:44.813 --> 01:01:46.474
It's good though.

01:01:52.654 --> 01:01:57.557
This is one godforsaken road.
I bet you no one ever comes down it.

01:02:09.571 --> 01:02:12.005
Yeah, well, they won't stop, though.

01:02:21.850 --> 01:02:23.408
Bet you need a jack.

01:02:26.855 --> 01:02:28.846
Then what happened was...

01:02:29.024 --> 01:02:32.585
...he came as a hundred mouths,
open and stinking with decay...

01:02:32.794 --> 01:02:35.854
...and he tore at my flesh
from every angle of Heaven.

01:02:36.031 --> 01:02:38.795
I grabbed Beelzebub's blue
tongue in my fist....

01:02:39.701 --> 01:02:41.498
Who's Beelzebub?

01:02:42.103 --> 01:02:43.570
Beelzebub is Satan.

01:02:46.875 --> 01:02:49.036
Michael, get in the car.

01:03:12.567 --> 01:03:16.059
-What'll it be, folks?
-Do you have pie?

01:03:16.237 --> 01:03:17.898
Do we have pie?

01:03:18.073 --> 01:03:20.564
You're in the pie capital of America.

01:03:21.242 --> 01:03:22.402
Well, we want....

01:03:22.577 --> 01:03:25.137
We want pie. What have you got?

01:03:25.480 --> 01:03:29.473
I got them memorized, okay? Ready?
We got apple, of course...

01:03:29.651 --> 01:03:32.484
...banana cream, coconut
cream, sour cream raisin.

01:03:33.355 --> 01:03:34.413
Chocolate cream?

01:03:34.856 --> 01:03:37.654
Definitely. Chocolate cream...

01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:39.292
...and...

01:03:39.494 --> 01:03:41.985
...strawberry rhubard pie and...

01:03:42.163 --> 01:03:43.152
...cherry...

01:03:43.365 --> 01:03:45.094
...and lemon meringue.

01:03:47.602 --> 01:03:50.366
We want two slices of everything.

01:03:50.505 --> 01:03:52.769
And vanilla ice cream on the side.

01:04:15.029 --> 01:04:17.463
-Bliss.
-That's banana cream, that's chocolate.

01:04:17.632 --> 01:04:20.123
Everybody get out of my banana cream.

01:04:21.336 --> 01:04:24.533
That's the pie.
What is, what is this pie?

01:04:24.706 --> 01:04:26.139
Sour cream raisin.

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:33.304
What is it about pie?

01:04:33.481 --> 01:04:35.915
There's nothing prettier than pie...

01:04:36.050 --> 01:04:39.713
...with scalloped edges and slits
in the top for the heat to escape.

01:04:39.921 --> 01:04:42.981
Pie gives you the sense that you're
a 4-square person...

01:04:43.158 --> 01:04:45.490
...living in a 4-square country.

01:04:45.660 --> 01:04:48.322
-A pie says home.
-As American as apple pie.

01:04:48.496 --> 01:04:49.724
I wish I invented pie.

01:04:49.998 --> 01:04:51.226
I did.

01:04:55.170 --> 01:04:56.569
I'm just kidding.

01:04:58.173 --> 01:04:59.504
That was a good one.

01:05:01.309 --> 01:05:04.073
God is in His Heaven
and all's right with the world.

01:05:04.512 --> 01:05:05.740
My mother...

01:05:05.947 --> 01:05:08.177
-...made a great--
-Blueberry pie.

01:05:12.253 --> 01:05:13.515
So do l.

01:05:14.522 --> 01:05:15.955
I have to say I like...

01:05:16.090 --> 01:05:17.717
...cream pie more than fruit pie.

01:05:17.892 --> 01:05:18.950
Me too.

01:05:19.194 --> 01:05:20.957
That is so wrong.

01:05:21.095 --> 01:05:22.460
I like them all.

01:05:22.764 --> 01:05:24.459
I like you.

01:05:28.369 --> 01:05:30.360
Sing your song about pie.

01:05:31.973 --> 01:05:34.601
You have a song about pie?

01:05:35.477 --> 01:05:37.104
Actually I do.

01:05:38.279 --> 01:05:39.507
Sing, Dorothy.

01:05:39.881 --> 01:05:40.973
Now.

01:05:43.284 --> 01:05:44.615
"Pie, pie...

01:05:44.786 --> 01:05:46.117
"...me, oh, my

01:05:46.287 --> 01:05:49.051
"Nothing tastes sweet,
wet, salty, and dry

01:05:49.224 --> 01:05:51.988
"All at once so well as pie

01:05:52.126 --> 01:05:54.890
"Apple, pumpkin,
mince and black bottom

01:05:55.063 --> 01:05:56.792
"I'll come to your place...

01:05:56.998 --> 01:06:01.901
"...every day if you've got 'em
Pie, me, oh, my, I love pie"

01:06:08.810 --> 01:06:10.573
Sing another song.

01:06:14.415 --> 01:06:19.318
It's in B flat. It's pretty basic but
watch out for the retard down there.

01:06:27.562 --> 01:06:28.927
I'm nervous.

01:06:30.732 --> 01:06:33.792
You'll have to forgive me,
it's a work in progress.

01:06:33.968 --> 01:06:36.402
Don't apologize, Dorothy. Okay.

01:06:43.411 --> 01:06:48.314
"I'm sitting by the side of the road
in the middle of nowhere

01:06:50.985 --> 01:06:53.579
"I don't know where I'm going...

01:06:53.988 --> 01:06:57.924
"...but I hope I know it
when I get there

"Thinking about how
love never works out

01:07:02.330 --> 01:07:05.265
"But I guess that's the way it goes

"And how this story ends

"...about Miles, Ralph, and Bradley

-I went to college. I was published.
-You were?

01:09:23.136 --> 01:09:26.800
I was. It was like a yearly
thing of poems, you know.

01:09:26.974 --> 01:09:28.965
It's great. That's great.

01:09:29.577 --> 01:09:31.408
It's really great.

01:09:32.479 --> 01:09:33.742
It's cold.

01:09:34.314 --> 01:09:36.749
I'm in there, this is Huey's room.

01:09:38.086 --> 01:09:39.314
Where are you?

01:09:40.087 --> 01:09:41.645
I'm in four.

01:09:41.823 --> 01:09:43.085
Where is that?

01:09:43.256 --> 01:09:44.656
It's up there.

01:09:46.260 --> 01:09:48.591
-Where exactly?
-On the corner.

01:09:48.763 --> 01:09:51.630
Right there?
You're directly over my room.

01:09:58.272 --> 01:09:59.671
You were great.

01:10:00.007 --> 01:10:01.440
Really great.

01:10:02.343 --> 01:10:03.435
It was....

01:10:05.113 --> 01:10:07.343
-Good night.
-Good night.

01:10:11.285 --> 01:10:12.445
It was....

01:10:16.190 --> 01:10:19.682
"Something in your eyes...

What are you doing tonight?

01:10:39.881 --> 01:10:41.212
Not much.

01:10:41.549 --> 01:10:43.210
Want to come to my room?

01:10:43.885 --> 01:10:45.716
Why don't you come to mine?

01:10:47.321 --> 01:10:48.879
That's a good idea.

01:11:15.249 --> 01:11:18.184
"...how I wanted someone...

01:11:18.352 --> 01:11:20.843
"...to come along

01:11:22.690 --> 01:11:24.590
"And change my life...."

01:11:25.426 --> 01:11:27.257
-I must tell you something.
-I know.

01:11:27.428 --> 01:11:30.363
-I'm not--
-Ever falling in love with anyone again.

01:11:30.531 --> 01:11:31.589
I know.

01:11:31.766 --> 01:11:35.930
"Feels like home to me

01:11:41.108 --> 01:11:45.272
"Feels like I'm all the way back...

01:11:45.446 --> 01:11:48.210
"...where I come from"

01:13:18.973 --> 01:13:20.702
Come here, Sparky.

01:13:20.875 --> 01:13:21.864
Come here.

01:13:24.378 --> 01:13:25.868
Wings?

01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:28.473
Far out.

01:13:29.383 --> 01:13:31.146
Some angel.

01:14:49.397 --> 01:14:51.297
I needed the job.

01:14:57.638 --> 01:14:58.900
Good morning.

01:14:59.640 --> 01:15:02.905
What exactly are we
talking about here?

01:15:04.145 --> 01:15:07.979
At the paper. That's what
I tried to tell you last night.

01:15:08.582 --> 01:15:11.312
I don't make excuses
for working in there...

01:15:11.485 --> 01:15:13.646
...there's no reason for you to.

01:15:18.492 --> 01:15:20.084
Here's a confession.

01:15:20.661 --> 01:15:22.253
You want to hear a confession?

01:15:22.430 --> 01:15:23.488
Yours?

01:15:23.931 --> 01:15:26.422
I needed the job too.

01:15:28.436 --> 01:15:31.599
No one'd go near me after
what happened at the Tribune.

01:15:31.772 --> 01:15:33.433
What did happen?

01:15:36.343 --> 01:15:39.107
I hit the managing editor.

01:15:39.513 --> 01:15:40.673
Why?

01:15:41.015 --> 01:15:45.952
He fired this really sweet old guy
who'd been there for, like, 27 years....

01:15:47.521 --> 01:15:48.681
Really?

01:15:49.457 --> 01:15:50.515
Nope.

01:15:52.626 --> 01:15:54.787
He changed my lead.

01:15:54.962 --> 01:15:58.955
You hit him because
he changed your lead?

01:16:04.138 --> 01:16:06.197
It was late. I was drunk.

01:16:09.310 --> 01:16:11.710
It makes no difference where I work.

01:16:11.879 --> 01:16:12.971
That's a lie.

01:16:13.147 --> 01:16:16.173
Bet you've got a half-finished
novel in your desk.

01:16:17.318 --> 01:16:18.649
She got the desk.

01:16:21.889 --> 01:16:24.380
Are you keeping something from me?

01:16:28.496 --> 01:16:30.054
I'm not ethical.

01:16:30.631 --> 01:16:35.159
Just because you write about
angels for a supermarket tabloid?

01:16:40.040 --> 01:16:44.340
Are you keeping some
angel experience from me?

01:16:46.347 --> 01:16:48.406
If you are I forgive you.

01:16:49.850 --> 01:16:52.011
I think I could forgive you anything.

01:16:56.257 --> 01:16:59.749
This was not a mistake.
Don't say it was a mistake.

01:16:59.927 --> 01:17:01.417
I couldn't bear it.

01:17:27.288 --> 01:17:28.880
It's going well.

01:17:31.625 --> 01:17:33.718
It's a difficult case, though.

01:17:34.728 --> 01:17:37.128
To give a man back his heart.

01:17:44.138 --> 01:17:45.264
Listen.

01:17:49.243 --> 01:17:50.972
Listen to the earth.

01:18:00.087 --> 01:18:02.988
I'm going to miss everything so much.

01:18:13.367 --> 01:18:14.732
Remember, Sparky....

01:18:14.868 --> 01:18:16.836
No matter what they say...

01:18:17.004 --> 01:18:19.336
...you can never have too much sugar.

01:18:38.459 --> 01:18:40.188
Good morning, Michael.

01:18:41.028 --> 01:18:42.495
Good morning, Sparky.

01:19:06.220 --> 01:19:08.051
No, he's all right.

01:19:19.066 --> 01:19:20.658
Oh, I killed him.

01:19:21.335 --> 01:19:23.735
-It's not your fault.
-It's all my fault.

01:19:23.904 --> 01:19:25.394
I'm so sorry, Huey.

01:19:31.578 --> 01:19:33.341
I'm so sorry.

01:19:44.758 --> 01:19:46.851
You didn't do anything wrong.

01:19:59.707 --> 01:20:01.038
Do something.

01:20:02.209 --> 01:20:03.699
It isn't my area.

01:20:03.877 --> 01:20:05.105
What is your area?

01:20:05.279 --> 01:20:06.712
Explain it to me.

01:20:08.615 --> 01:20:12.711
Somebody tell me exactly
what is his area.

01:20:13.220 --> 01:20:17.384
I don't know anything about his area.
That's what I meant to tell you.

01:20:17.558 --> 01:20:18.718
What?

01:20:18.959 --> 01:20:21.894
I don't know anything about angels.

01:20:22.730 --> 01:20:25.961
I'm a dog trainer.
That's why I was hired.

01:20:27.634 --> 01:20:29.397
To train Sparky?

01:20:30.237 --> 01:20:31.636
And then after...

01:20:33.073 --> 01:20:36.804
...we screw up with the angel
and Malt gets the dog....

01:20:38.412 --> 01:20:40.573
I get Huey's job.

01:20:42.916 --> 01:20:44.508
I didn't know you.

01:20:49.089 --> 01:20:50.420
I'm sorry.

01:20:52.593 --> 01:20:54.288
I'm sorry too.

01:20:58.165 --> 01:21:00.258
Now bring him back to life.

01:21:02.102 --> 01:21:06.664
Don't give me any of that "it isn't my
area" stuff. Bring him back to life...

01:21:06.840 --> 01:21:09.274
...or go back where you came from.

01:21:11.111 --> 01:21:12.601
Bring him back.

01:21:16.116 --> 01:21:17.344
Angel.

01:23:48.335 --> 01:23:50.269
I don't have much longer.

01:25:05.746 --> 01:25:07.805
We're here, Michael. We're here.

01:25:19.426 --> 01:25:20.825
Look up.

01:25:23.764 --> 01:25:27.598
"The Sears Tower in Chicago
is the world's tallest building.

01:25:27.768 --> 01:25:31.499
"It stands 1,454 feet
above street level...

01:25:31.672 --> 01:25:33.833
"...contains enough concrete...

01:25:34.007 --> 01:25:36.100
"...for an eight-lane highway."

01:25:45.786 --> 01:25:47.617
Quinlan, I'm so sorry.

01:25:48.789 --> 01:25:50.689
I didn't do what I came for.

01:25:52.793 --> 01:25:54.192
I didn't finish.

01:25:57.464 --> 01:25:58.954
I'm so sorry.

01:26:05.806 --> 01:26:07.034
Good-bye.

01:26:07.808 --> 01:26:09.036
Good-bye, Michael.

01:26:09.543 --> 01:26:11.374
Thank you for everything.

01:26:11.978 --> 01:26:13.969
For letting me have a little fun.

01:26:14.648 --> 01:26:17.048
Good-bye, my battling friend.

01:26:17.517 --> 01:26:19.712
Good-bye world's biggest angel.

01:26:20.387 --> 01:26:22.048
Godspeed.

01:27:45.705 --> 01:27:47.639
-You're late.
-We know.

01:27:47.808 --> 01:27:49.139
Where's the angel?

01:27:49.976 --> 01:27:51.307
It was a hoax.

01:27:51.478 --> 01:27:52.740
-A hoax?
-A hoax.

01:27:52.913 --> 01:27:54.073
Definitely.

01:27:54.247 --> 01:27:57.148
-He had detachable wings.
-And a halo made out of pipe cleaners.

01:27:57.317 --> 01:28:00.445
And he smelled of cookies.
Just kidding.

01:28:01.922 --> 01:28:02.911
I win.

01:28:03.757 --> 01:28:05.156
You're fired...

01:28:05.325 --> 01:28:06.656
...and I get the dog.

01:28:07.727 --> 01:28:09.922
Come on, my little sausage.

01:28:11.264 --> 01:28:12.822
You come to your daddy.

01:28:14.467 --> 01:28:15.627
You bastard.

01:28:17.771 --> 01:28:18.760
Listen.

01:28:19.806 --> 01:28:21.774
Don't hate me. I love you.

01:28:24.477 --> 01:28:25.808
Get the mutt out.

01:28:26.112 --> 01:28:29.275
Like that dog can be gotten out.
Like he can do anything.

01:28:29.449 --> 01:28:30.848
That is the worst dog...

01:28:31.017 --> 01:28:33.008
-...I've ever met.
-You said you could train any dog.

01:28:33.186 --> 01:28:34.483
She was wrong.

01:28:34.955 --> 01:28:37.617
So I'm stuck with these two
because of a dog?

01:28:37.791 --> 01:28:40.521
You're stuck with Mr. Driscoll,
not with me.

01:28:40.694 --> 01:28:43.663
We met a guy with a 2-headed chicken.

01:28:46.199 --> 01:28:47.530
Where are you going?

01:28:51.538 --> 01:28:52.800
Where are you going?

01:28:54.140 --> 01:28:55.368
Get off.

01:28:57.711 --> 01:28:59.702
Whatever I said, don't...

01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:01.472
...don't take it personally.

01:29:01.815 --> 01:29:04.477
-You're the best reporter I have.
-I'm out of here.

01:29:12.993 --> 01:29:14.722
You're just going to leave?

01:29:14.895 --> 01:29:17.227
-We won't talk about it?
-Nope.

01:29:17.397 --> 01:29:18.728
Come on.

01:29:18.899 --> 01:29:20.230
Talk to me.

01:29:20.500 --> 01:29:23.162
Disagree with me.
Argue me out of it.

01:29:23.403 --> 01:29:26.167
All right, let's have
a fight. Fight me.

01:29:27.407 --> 01:29:30.672
You're the only one
that ever fought with me here.

01:29:31.578 --> 01:29:32.909
Who will I fight?

01:29:33.079 --> 01:29:36.071
-You must help me out here.
-It isn't my area.

01:29:36.249 --> 01:29:37.409
Wait.

01:29:46.359 --> 01:29:47.849
I'm sorry.

01:29:48.261 --> 01:29:49.592
Please stop.

01:29:51.031 --> 01:29:52.259
Stop and talk...

01:29:52.432 --> 01:29:53.421
...to me.

01:29:54.434 --> 01:29:57.369
I appreciate what you said
up there. I thank you.

01:29:57.537 --> 01:29:59.596
-I'll see you around.
-You said...

01:30:01.107 --> 01:30:03.041
...you could forgive me anything.

01:30:03.276 --> 01:30:04.607
I forgive you.

01:30:05.612 --> 01:30:07.204
We had a good time.

01:30:07.380 --> 01:30:08.870
What are you so upset about?

01:30:11.718 --> 01:30:13.117
It's you.

01:30:15.388 --> 01:30:16.912
I remember you.

01:30:17.624 --> 01:30:19.285
I thought you were gone.

01:30:37.410 --> 01:30:40.140
"I took a trip on a train

01:30:40.313 --> 01:30:42.440
"And I thought about you

01:30:45.318 --> 01:30:48.082
"I passed a shadowy lane

01:30:49.422 --> 01:30:52.152
"And I thought about you"

01:30:58.665 --> 01:30:59.996
Good evening.

01:31:01.267 --> 01:31:05.499
For our specialties tonight,
we have angelhair pasta...

01:31:05.672 --> 01:31:07.833
...with a pomodoro sauce...

01:31:08.341 --> 01:31:12.277
...capellini primavera,
it's a melange of vegetables...

01:31:12.445 --> 01:31:14.709
...over angelhair pasta...

01:31:15.115 --> 01:31:17.606
...finally a light sauce with...

01:31:17.784 --> 01:31:19.615
...lemon and parsley...

01:31:19.786 --> 01:31:20.844
...it's tossed...

01:31:21.021 --> 01:31:23.012
...with angelhair pasta.

01:31:23.189 --> 01:31:25.350
-Anything else?
-Yes. We want...

01:31:25.525 --> 01:31:28.517
...one pumpkin nut muffin and....

01:31:29.462 --> 01:31:31.692
A piece of angel food cake.

01:31:32.198 --> 01:31:34.189
They don't have angel food cake.

01:31:34.367 --> 01:31:35.356
Do you?

01:31:35.735 --> 01:31:37.532
"And what did I do...

01:31:37.804 --> 01:31:40.534
"...l thought about you"

01:32:55.949 --> 01:32:57.211
So, did you...

01:32:57.383 --> 01:32:58.873
...ever tell anyone about...?

01:33:02.388 --> 01:33:03.719
I was going to.

01:33:03.890 --> 01:33:06.381
I couldn't wait to get home
to tell Valerie.

01:33:07.894 --> 01:33:10.727
And then I opened my mouth...

01:33:11.464 --> 01:33:14.024
...and the words wouldn't come out.

01:33:14.801 --> 01:33:18.237
I take a breath, I even opened
my mouth a second time.

01:33:19.139 --> 01:33:20.231
Nothing.

01:33:21.808 --> 01:33:24.572
As far as I'm concerned,
it never happened.

01:33:24.811 --> 01:33:26.142
But we saw it.

01:33:26.312 --> 01:33:27.404
We were there.

01:33:27.580 --> 01:33:28.979
It never happened.

01:33:30.316 --> 01:33:31.977
What are you up to now?

01:33:32.152 --> 01:33:33.915
I'm back on the novel.

01:33:36.156 --> 01:33:38.454
If it didn't happen,
where's your coat?

01:33:38.625 --> 01:33:41.753
What is this? lf it happened,
you know what?

01:33:41.928 --> 01:33:45.056
Then I must believe
that some day I'll be walking...

01:33:45.265 --> 01:33:49.429
...down the street, and some
unknown force will make me...

01:33:49.602 --> 01:33:52.435
...turn right instead of turning left...

01:33:52.605 --> 01:33:54.266
...and at that moment...

01:33:54.440 --> 01:33:55.771
...a car will...

01:33:55.942 --> 01:33:58.843
...come around the corner
with the woman of my dreams in it...

01:33:59.012 --> 01:34:00.843
...and blow a flat...

01:34:04.350 --> 01:34:07.513
...right there next to
where I'm standing.

01:34:15.528 --> 01:34:17.155
It never happened.

01:34:51.531 --> 01:34:52.828
Need any help?

01:34:52.999 --> 01:34:55.399
-No. Thanks.
-No. We're cool.

01:36:50.850 --> 01:36:51.942
Michael, wait!

01:37:11.137 --> 01:37:12.502
What are you doing here?

01:37:12.705 --> 01:37:14.036
I live here.

01:37:14.307 --> 01:37:16.207
I live two blocks from here.

01:37:17.710 --> 01:37:19.041
I was on my way home and...

01:37:19.645 --> 01:37:21.203
...l thought I saw....

01:37:21.547 --> 01:37:22.912
He came around this corner.

01:37:23.549 --> 01:37:24.880
That corner.

01:37:37.497 --> 01:37:38.930
I love you, Dorothy.

01:37:41.234 --> 01:37:42.565
I love you.

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:48.571
Marry me.

01:37:52.578 --> 01:37:54.205
Marry me, please.

01:37:56.516 --> 01:37:58.347
Marry me, Dorothy.

01:38:01.587 --> 01:38:04.317
Oh, my darling Dorothy,
will you marry me?

01:38:16.536 --> 01:38:17.935
Let's go home.

01:38:36.989 --> 01:38:38.889
You know, Pansy,
I invented marriage.

01:38:39.058 --> 01:38:41.390
-Michael.
-Well, I did.

01:38:41.794 --> 01:38:43.921
Before that you should have seen it.

01:38:44.130 --> 01:38:47.622
Everybody was so mixed up
they didn't know what to do.

01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:49.631
So I said, "Have a ceremony."

01:38:51.971 --> 01:38:53.302
Let's go home.

01:39:09.422 --> 01:39:11.083
Do you smell something?

01:39:11.257 --> 01:39:13.157
There's a bakery near here.

01:39:14.305 --> 01:39:20.687
