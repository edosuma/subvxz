00:29.375 --> 00:33.304
<i>Legend goes that somewhere
beneath these mountains lies</i>

00:33.312 --> 00:37.457
<i>a gateway between heaven and hell.</i>

00:38.693 --> 00:42.667
<i>It is said that a sacred sisterhood
guards this portal,</i>

00:42.674 --> 00:47.944
<i>and the power of their prayers keeps
the damned from tormenting the living.</i>

00:49.539 --> 00:52.297
<i>Trouble with the damned is...</i>

00:52.322 --> 00:54.503
<i>They never stay put.</i>

03:38.830 --> 03:41.024
<i>My son!</i>

03:41.291 --> 03:44.165
<i>We'll make a man of him, hey, Red?</i>

03:50.479 --> 03:52.251
<i>What wrong with ya?</i>

03:53.323 --> 03:55.088
<i>Be a man!</i>

06:16.885 --> 06:18.983
Good to see you again.

06:20.859 --> 06:23.450
Where is he?

06:23.841 --> 06:26.705
Boss is careful where he goes.

06:28.050 --> 06:29.919
We've had a little trouble.

06:30.663 --> 06:33.748
Why so many horses?

06:40.686 --> 06:43.593
Boss sent Red and me...

06:43.618 --> 06:45.539
Now, there's just me.

06:46.134 --> 06:49.471
Like I've said,
we've had a little trouble.

06:50.324 --> 06:52.801
We brought two too many.

06:59.693 --> 07:01.640
I didn't bring that one.

07:56.263 --> 07:58.027
Do you remember me?

09:05.844 --> 09:07.595
Where is he?

09:08.634 --> 09:10.410
He did not come.

09:26.420 --> 09:28.773
Still, he eludes you.

09:35.118 --> 09:37.280
<i>God's not goanna save ya!</i>

09:43.121 --> 09:46.066
I was to meet him here.

09:53.393 --> 09:56.462
I have nothing but...

10:14.484 --> 10:18.703
<i>Most times,
when you bring a man to justice,</i>

10:18.922 --> 10:23.185
<i>the axe swings,
the noose tightens,</i>

10:23.397 --> 10:25.187
<i>that's it.</i>

10:25.282 --> 10:28.825
<i>Out here, they come back.</i>

10:29.272 --> 10:32.446
<i>Harder to kill.</i>

10:33.197 --> 10:37.557
<i>The way I finish them?
Rip out their heads.</i>

10:37.582 --> 10:39.373
<i>As for these men?</i>

10:39.733 --> 10:41.679
<i>Target practice.</i>

11:31.851 --> 11:38.216
Might I say that,
among my many miracles and holy relics,

11:38.756 --> 11:42.390
I do carry certain apothecary goods.

11:43.610 --> 11:49.646
In these forbidding parts,
I sense a woman is a rarity.

11:51.351 --> 11:54.119
Which means a man must improvise.

12:02.199 --> 12:05.025
What piece of you can I buy for a dollar?

12:05.752 --> 12:07.653
My pity.

12:08.400 --> 12:10.420
I was being kind.

12:10.445 --> 12:14.908
I like my men...
heartless.

12:14.933 --> 12:17.024
Get back to your post.

12:29.819 --> 12:31.129
Well?

12:32.363 --> 12:36.177
- That was clever.
- Fancy bitch!

12:39.054 --> 12:40.646
You a thief?

12:50.561 --> 12:54.452
- You don't look like a thief.
- I'm a dancer.

12:56.312 --> 12:59.011
So, where'd you learn a trick like that?

13:00.957 --> 13:02.869
Ballet school.

13:07.174 --> 13:11.076
You know if you cross his path again,
he's liable to kill you.

13:11.577 --> 13:15.303
Death ain't the worst thing
that can happen to you.

13:17.390 --> 13:20.495
You ever heard of "The Gallowwalkers"?

13:38.823 --> 13:43.341
This special tonic will cure all ailments,

13:43.366 --> 13:47.058
and keep the Undead at bay.

13:48.822 --> 13:52.533
Dang priest! All right,
the wagon's here. Get 'em all up!

13:52.558 --> 13:55.278
- Move! Come on! Get in line!
- Get up!

13:55.567 --> 13:57.945
- Move it!
- Come on!

13:57.970 --> 14:00.889
- Move! Get up!
- Come on, you piece of shit!

14:00.914 --> 14:03.704
Come on, move your ass!
Come on, get in here!

15:48.206 --> 15:52.235
What's a girl got to do
to get rescued around here?

16:36.560 --> 16:39.050
You that good,
or was that a lucky shot?
62b

16:39.260 --> 16:40.850
Lucky for you.

16:43.132 --> 16:47.010
- So now I owe you?
- Now you owe me.

16:53.233 --> 16:55.058
You got a job in mind?

16:55.434 --> 16:57.037
Yes.

17:01.627 --> 17:03.305
Sir?

17:04.650 --> 17:06.781
Do you know where we are about?

17:07.805 --> 17:09.653
"Enochs Hammer".

17:10.123 --> 17:13.103
It sounds like a church tower,
a place of tolerance.

17:13.127 --> 17:16.040
There will look kindly
on one of their own. Yeah?

17:17.479 --> 17:20.747
So cruelly treated,
so manifestly wronged!

17:20.795 --> 17:22.640
Do you know your place?

17:22.851 --> 17:27.500
I have family there.
Seven brothers and sisters.

17:28.704 --> 17:30.989
All in the same grave.

17:54.513 --> 17:57.406
Whoa... Whoa there!

18:08.665 --> 18:12.492
Brothers and sisters
of Enoch's Hammer!

18:12.883 --> 18:15.559
Internally pure of heart.

18:15.943 --> 18:21.566
We have gathered here to
bear witness to God's justice,

18:21.583 --> 18:23.417
on the wicked and the damned.

18:25.082 --> 18:31.611
Bow now your golden heads
and pray for their souls.

18:33.990 --> 18:36.611
- Come on!
- Get down!

18:36.636 --> 18:39.023
- Come on!
- Move!

18:39.048 --> 18:41.857
- Get!
- Get up before I git you some!

18:46.638 --> 18:50.334
Come on, little darling, get up!
Get up!

19:02.870 --> 19:05.218
Welcome, pilgrims!

19:07.282 --> 19:10.084
I do not call you "prisoners".

19:10.890 --> 19:13.933
Nor do I call these "gallows".

19:14.473 --> 19:18.864
These are the gates
of your salvation.

19:21.146 --> 19:23.478
For this sacrifice,

19:23.706 --> 19:27.214
God has chosen you,

19:27.325 --> 19:29.100
as the lamb.

19:29.359 --> 19:31.890
Just as he chose me

19:32.078 --> 19:37.428
to help these righteous people
spread justice across the land.

19:40.218 --> 19:44.112
- I was once a sinner...
- Damn right, you were!

19:44.113 --> 19:45.916
Cherry Gaza.

19:46.198 --> 19:50.854
- You all virgin eater!
- You whore of Babylon!

19:51.363 --> 19:53.073
You painted cat!

19:53.371 --> 19:55.260
You womb of vipers!

19:55.706 --> 19:59.783
The smell of Jezebel
has no power over me now!

20:01.073 --> 20:07.163
When I saw the devil
rise up from his grave...

20:08.204 --> 20:10.973
Sir, to whom do we plead our case?

20:10.998 --> 20:15.055
- St. Peter!
- You cannot hang us without a trial!

20:16.267 --> 20:19.836
I can and I will!

20:21.025 --> 20:26.638
You've already been judged
and found wanting in the eyes of the Lord.

20:27.029 --> 20:30.966
It's through His mercy that he
brought you here to be cleansed, by the rope.

20:30.991 --> 20:34.414
Just as he cleansed me
when I saw the devil!

20:34.439 --> 20:37.006
Rise from the gutter!

20:39.686 --> 20:41.928
I'll be needing' a shirt.

20:43.897 --> 20:46.053
We've only got one colour, Sir.

21:03.256 --> 21:05.667
You can't go wrong with white.

21:08.788 --> 21:12.422
I'll do my best, Sir.
We keep more out the back.

21:23.527 --> 21:27.939
Kiss Cut.
And you must be...?

22:11.301 --> 22:14.728
What do ya' think?
Is it me?

22:34.519 --> 22:38.009
- How many?
- Five.

23:19.688 --> 23:22.031
Alright, stranger.

23:22.767 --> 23:25.513
I'm goanna have to see your face.

24:25.818 --> 24:28.105
The cuffs are a little long.

24:36.611 --> 24:38.205
Bring 'em in.

24:57.827 --> 25:00.481
"And hell came forth
with chains and whips"

25:00.506 --> 25:02.346
"The Horseman of the Apocalypse".

26:24.221 --> 26:27.524
I'm not taking' another step
until you give me some answers.

26:51.013 --> 26:52.642
I'm standing' right here.

26:57.300 --> 27:00.131
You see this?
My fucking' hands hurt.

27:35.106 --> 27:36.895
Put â€‹â€‹it on.

29:47.214 --> 29:49.390
Can you do it with your left?

31:33.499 --> 31:35.220
Half now,

31:36.346 --> 31:38.261
half when you finish the job.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.648
How many more?

31:41.516 --> 31:43.624
It doesn't matter.

31:43.781 --> 31:46.353
Only matters is,
if it's too many for you.

31:47.401 --> 31:50.438
You goanna give me some
answers about those things?

31:53.689 --> 31:56.077
Now that's starting' the story...

31:56.461 --> 31:58.279
at the end.

31:59.764 --> 32:01.857
It begins with a whore.

32:03.444 --> 32:08.378
She's with child when the mines dry up,
so she becomes a thief.

32:08.395 --> 32:10.614
But not very good.

32:11.155 --> 32:15.543
She's headed for the gallows
when Sisters of San Diablo find her.

32:15.840 --> 32:21.553
They take her in and teach her the secrets
of the dead.

32:22.601 --> 32:27.802
When the boy child is born they tell her:
"You must give him up."

32:28.014 --> 32:31.724
"The Gateway to Hell
is no place to raise a child."

32:32.733 --> 32:34.904
So she sends him to an orphanage.

32:35.149 --> 32:40.328
And there... he grows.
And grows...

32:40.353 --> 32:42.623
and grows...

32:42.648 --> 32:45.192
Until the clock strikes twelve.

32:45.709 --> 32:50.218
And then they tell him:
"You're a man. You must leave."

32:50.720 --> 32:52.574
But where...?

32:54.638 --> 32:57.415
A widowed woman meets him,

32:57.495 --> 33:00.710
likes him, takes him in.

33:02.523 --> 33:05.266
She is the mistress
of a slaughter house.

33:05.384 --> 33:08.348
She teaches him a trade,
puts food on the table.

33:08.373 --> 33:10.537
Loves him.

33:11.382 --> 33:13.787
And raises him with...

33:14.225 --> 33:16.622
her daughter.

33:18.083 --> 33:21.854
A beautiful daughter.

33:22.653 --> 33:25.983
He â€‹â€‹grows to love the daughter.

33:33.664 --> 33:37.273
She is his to protect.

33:37.501 --> 33:42.741
One sunrise, she tells him:
Go with mother to sell the skins.

33:42.766 --> 33:46.779
"Don't worry,
I can take care of myself".

33:49.334 --> 33:51.126
He leaves her.

33:52.713 --> 33:55.038
Five men ride by...

33:55.367 --> 33:57.145
they find her alone.

33:57.184 --> 33:58.887
<i>Go on!</i>

34:01.122 --> 34:03.234
And they make use of her.

34:09.820 --> 34:12.773
<i>You bitch!</i>

34:15.672 --> 34:18.601
She keeps it secret
until she can no more.

34:18.799 --> 34:21.260
For now she is with child.

34:21.550 --> 34:25.858
She begs him: Forgive her,
forget what has happened to her.

34:25.882 --> 34:28.083
For the sake of the unburned.

34:29.333 --> 34:33.842
She says the men are gone,
and to her, they mean nothing.

34:33.867 --> 34:36.105
But not to him.

34:36.387 --> 34:38.049
No...

34:38.683 --> 34:43.995
For one of them
grows inside of her.

34:47.012 --> 34:48.878
Unbearable.

34:49.831 --> 34:53.029
So for a second time, he leaves.

34:54.061 --> 34:58.668
For the next five years,
he remembers nothing...

34:58.927 --> 35:03.449
but the pain of not
being by her side.

35:04.668 --> 35:07.690
He returns to find her dead.

35:08.331 --> 35:13.029
She died giving birth to that...

35:13.054 --> 35:15.138
Child.

35:17.413 --> 35:20.560
They took from him
the thing he loved most.

35:22.459 --> 35:25.160
Those who were responsible...

35:28.036 --> 35:29.856
would pay.

36:52.898 --> 36:54.261
Troy?

36:55.401 --> 36:56.816
Son!

36:59.098 --> 37:03.270
Get ready!
The boys are sending' someone!

37:06.036 --> 37:08.096
We're getting' out of here!

37:13.510 --> 37:15.919
He's here, my darling.

37:34.215 --> 37:36.337
I always hate that bitch!

37:43.706 --> 37:45.556
Senor! Amigo!

37:49.868 --> 37:51.408
Come on, get us out!

37:52.424 --> 37:54.331
Get us outta here!

38:05.562 --> 38:07.110
Who are you?

38:13.087 --> 38:14.769
Her name...

38:15.520 --> 38:17.286
was Sueno.

39:13.817 --> 39:16.612
- You're late.
- Well...

39:20.312 --> 39:23.366
There was some that needed convincing...

39:23.875 --> 39:25.788
this was "a good idea".

39:28.930 --> 39:31.995
A bottle of beer is "a good idea".

39:32.015 --> 39:35.337
Wearing a hat in the rain is "a good idea".

39:35.354 --> 39:38.582
This... is genius.

39:53.530 --> 39:55.906
Shut the hell up, bitch!

40:06.305 --> 40:08.981
You touch me and you're dead!

40:09.755 --> 40:13.869
Compelling argument.
You must be a lawyer.

40:14.354 --> 40:16.235
She's a whore.

40:16.916 --> 40:20.439
An easy mistake.
I apologize.

40:45.257 --> 40:47.177
Good texture.

40:49.643 --> 40:52.590
Tough, yet soft.

41:06.403 --> 41:07.965
You'll fit in well.

41:13.798 --> 41:16.285
I'm looking for the right girl...

41:17.223 --> 41:19.095
for my boy.

41:33.795 --> 41:35.600
You freak!

41:37.186 --> 41:38.989
I get that a lot.

41:41.295 --> 41:44.197
It doesn't stop it hurting though.

41:48.768 --> 41:50.629
God have mercy!

42:09.676 --> 42:13.160
We die, we come back.

42:13.427 --> 42:18.547
You call us...
Gallowwalkers.

42:24.744 --> 42:29.689
Well, if it's good enough for Jesus,
it should be good  enough for us.

42:42.932 --> 42:45.575
It's a God damn miracle, ain't it?

42:45.600 --> 42:51.536
It happens, but no one knows
who or how or why.

42:51.561 --> 42:53.923
No one knows.

42:54.432 --> 42:56.164
Here's the thing...

42:59.267 --> 43:01.159
I get shot...

43:07.629 --> 43:10.560
My son, gets shot...

43:11.452 --> 43:14.109
Three of my men get shot.

43:14.473 --> 43:17.566
The son of a bitch even shoots my whore.

43:21.652 --> 43:23.848
I come back.

43:26.943 --> 43:29.743
My men come back.

43:30.657 --> 43:33.291
Even my fucking whore comes back!

43:33.316 --> 43:35.201
But with my son?

43:35.288 --> 43:37.535
Death persists!

43:42.301 --> 43:44.444
Life's little mystery.

43:52.069 --> 43:57.985
Does anyone here know
where I might find the Sisters of San Diablo?

43:58.369 --> 44:00.422
In the Mountain of Resurrection?

44:04.275 --> 44:06.112
No...

45:04.543 --> 45:06.025
Clear!

46:35.443 --> 46:37.288
You sleep now.

46:39.214 --> 46:40.972
Eat if you're hungry.

46:42.246 --> 46:44.086
How much time I got?

46:44.790 --> 46:47.139
Sleep? To eat?

46:47.204 --> 46:48.771
Or to live?

47:25.063 --> 47:26.679
Who is he?

47:28.562 --> 47:30.806
The first I could find.

47:31.744 --> 47:33.294
What happened?

47:36.069 --> 47:37.934
They know who I am.

47:43.357 --> 47:45.296
So now they will come.

47:46.376 --> 47:50.118
You bring this boy because you
think I cannot fight at your side?

47:54.868 --> 47:58.272
I can fight.
You know I can fight!

48:11.826 --> 48:14.015
Did one see your face?

48:17.157 --> 48:19.346
It was a mistake.

48:22.949 --> 48:25.208
You don't make mistakes.

48:26.646 --> 48:28.880
Perhaps you want him to come.

48:30.475 --> 48:33.234
Perhaps you want him
to know who hunts him.

48:34.594 --> 48:36.780
You want him to come.

48:37.860 --> 48:41.095
To finish it here,
where it all began.

49:20.909 --> 49:22.945
You got to shave?

49:29.781 --> 49:33.239
- I got no beard.
- Me neither.

49:33.428 --> 49:35.550
Wanna play a game?

49:36.207 --> 49:40.199
- No, I don't.
- Wanna throw shots for money?

49:44.723 --> 49:46.294
Yes, I do.

50:32.471 --> 50:34.103
My turn.

51:01.797 --> 51:03.362
Damn it!

51:05.652 --> 51:09.196
One dollar,
and we never talk of this day again.

52:13.854 --> 52:15.955
<i>I never knew my mother.</i>

52:15.980 --> 52:19.863
<i>But I can sense
that she was always there.</i>

52:31.028 --> 52:36.026
<i>As for Sueno,
she was my everything.</i>

52:36.051 --> 52:38.231
<i>My friend,</i>

52:38.654 --> 52:40.523
<i>my lover,</i>

52:41.149 --> 52:43.400
<i>the memory that I lived for.</i>

53:17.320 --> 53:19.402
Where you want me?

53:24.778 --> 53:26.579
Skinning' shed.

53:27.306 --> 53:29.196
You're goanna need this.

53:41.664 --> 53:46.806
There's ah... there's really
nothing' coming that we won't see.

53:48.544 --> 53:50.576
Well, you didn't see that.

53:53.632 --> 53:55.571
Oh Jesus!

53:57.783 --> 54:00.106
Okay... okay.

54:00.131 --> 54:01.567
Alright.

54:03.873 --> 54:05.764
You win.

54:06.476 --> 54:11.600
Okay, so ah... back to the skinning' shed.
Two guns, shoot 'em in the head.  Anything else?

54:18.051 --> 54:19.329
Okay.

55:12.959 --> 55:15.045
Oh.. you look good, Boss!

55:16.906 --> 55:18.965
He was young.

55:23.779 --> 55:25.935
What do you think of mine, Boss?

55:26.452 --> 55:31.432
It's not pretty, but...
it stands up to the sun, huh?

55:32.894 --> 55:34.781
They may laugh,

55:34.962 --> 55:38.033
but you don't see me
hiding in a hood, huh?

55:38.214 --> 55:41.001
Shrivelling like beef jerky.

55:44.307 --> 55:47.437
They need skinning again in a week.

55:48.734 --> 55:50.277
But me?

55:50.372 --> 55:53.577
I get a good month wear of this.

55:53.992 --> 55:58.505
And I think a lizard skin
is a good look for me.

55:59.075 --> 56:00.903
Suit yourself.

56:01.154 --> 56:03.568
All the more flesh for us.

56:08.609 --> 56:10.219
Boss?

56:12.173 --> 56:16.916
If I do a good job,
can I have her lips?

56:22.792 --> 56:24.457
Yes you can.

56:40.948 --> 56:43.081
If you do a bad job,

56:43.246 --> 56:46.015
and I'll sew her lips
on your face myself.

56:46.078 --> 56:48.263
And that'll come with a beard.

56:59.750 --> 57:01.244
Priest!

57:04.619 --> 57:08.498
About time.
I've been dying' for this.

57:10.460 --> 57:12.211
Girl?

57:13.250 --> 57:14.866
Take her.

57:38.553 --> 57:42.204
Forgive me Father,
for I have skinned.

57:42.721 --> 57:45.770
- Mosca!
- Yes, Boss, I come!

57:48.232 --> 57:52.616
Sit still, huh?
You hiding something, you hide, huh?

57:52.633 --> 57:55.869
I find it, I find it.

57:56.409 --> 57:58.251
Now where is it?

58:04.431 --> 58:06.228
Tell me that's it.

58:09.292 --> 58:12.250
Let me see here.
Yes, Boss.

58:12.275 --> 58:15.989
It's what we've been looking for.
It's the map to Skull Mountain.

58:16.014 --> 58:18.088
It's ours now, yeah?

58:26.878 --> 58:29.390
And so it came to pass,

58:29.593 --> 58:33.515
in a time when Popes made pacts
with pagan lords,

58:33.540 --> 58:36.453
the Sisters in San Diablo,

58:36.813 --> 58:40.841
had forced upon them
a most cursed devotion.

58:42.084 --> 58:45.552
One that no other sisterhood
could endure.

58:45.788 --> 58:48.196
The passion of their prayer

58:48.221 --> 58:52.515
would became the power that keeps
the damned from walking the earth.

58:52.540 --> 58:58.100
And so into their hands passed the
ancient secrets of what divides the living

58:58.101 --> 58:59.671
from the dead.

59:04.023 --> 59:06.193
Where are they, Chicken bones?

59:06.919 --> 59:08.984
Where do they hide?

59:25.951 --> 59:28.478
Does the rest of him arrive monthly?

59:28.979 --> 59:30.797
We had a little trouble.

59:32.939 --> 59:37.170
I got shot.
I got shot bad, Boss.

59:50.692 --> 59:52.360
He's back.

59:53.773 --> 59:55.331
You know him?

01:00:01.196 --> 01:00:05.165
You never forget the man who
kills you for the first time.

01:00:06.174 --> 01:00:09.329
The first time is always special.

01:00:09.581 --> 01:00:12.676
Skull bucket.
Take the rest of the men.

01:00:12.701 --> 01:00:17.374
Find the gunman.  Kill him.
And anyone that's with him.

01:01:03.088 --> 01:01:05.589
You got to sober up, 'mam.

01:01:05.614 --> 01:01:08.543
Alright? It could be the day.

01:01:09.700 --> 01:01:11.906
What did he tell you, kid?

01:01:17.422 --> 01:01:19.494
He told you nothing!

01:01:21.276 --> 01:01:25.937
Look. There's five men.
He has killed them once.

01:01:25.962 --> 01:01:28.472
Now he must kill them again.

01:01:30.277 --> 01:01:32.075
I need dunking.

01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:45.784
No.

01:01:45.941 --> 01:01:50.843
He's got the one thing
that a gunman needs to be great.

01:01:53.313 --> 01:01:55.207
A reason to live.

01:01:55.232 --> 01:01:56.664
Now!

01:05:59.784 --> 01:06:01.764
Come on! Come on!

01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.877
You're okay, kid.

01:08:41.224 --> 01:08:42.805
Aman...!

01:08:45.417 --> 01:08:46.942
Aman...!

01:09:07.464 --> 01:09:09.022
Kids.

01:09:47.578 --> 01:09:49.328
You saved me.

01:09:49.899 --> 01:09:52.469
I never want to see that thing again.

01:10:08.453 --> 01:10:10.332
Who you looking' for?

01:10:15.919 --> 01:10:17.962
The one that didn't come.

01:10:19.854 --> 01:10:23.047
- Where is he?
- I'll find him.

01:10:24.704 --> 01:10:26.811
Guess we made it.

01:10:32.068 --> 01:10:33.845
I'm goanna go.

01:10:36.145 --> 01:10:37.520
Hey?

01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:39.841
Yeah?

01:11:17.729 --> 01:11:19.220
You killed me.

01:11:21.213 --> 01:11:23.391
Why the fuck did you shoot me?

01:11:24.275 --> 01:11:26.074
You would have bled to death.

01:11:43.598 --> 01:11:46.565
A man might take the news of his own death...

01:11:46.581 --> 01:11:48.207
badly.

01:12:01.465 --> 01:12:05.188
<i>I felt for the kid,
I really did.</i>

01:12:05.213 --> 01:12:07.855
<i>But I couldn't just leave him to die.</i>

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:13.956
<i>Me, I had unfinished business
at my place of my own resurrection.</i>

01:12:20.066 --> 01:12:23.332
<i>I figured,
if I ever made it back,</i>

01:12:23.357 --> 01:12:27.840
<i>I would tell him about the time
when I died.</i>

01:13:52.853 --> 01:13:54.688
<i>It was over.</i>

01:13:54.713 --> 01:13:57.254
<i>My death meant nothing.</i>

01:13:57.279 --> 01:14:00.912
<i>But to my mother,
it was everything.</i>

01:14:04.304 --> 01:14:08.068
Let him live.
He's my only son.

01:14:08.093 --> 01:14:10.487
And I'll stay here as your servant,

01:14:11.238 --> 01:14:15.386
<i>Oh, my price is a little higher than that.</i>

01:14:15.739 --> 01:14:18.403
<i>He is one of mine now.</i>

01:14:18.638 --> 01:14:22.564
<i>He has blood on his hands.</i>

01:14:24.362 --> 01:14:28.333
<i>My deal is this:</i>

01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:31.506
<i>When he is resurrected,</i>

01:14:31.531 --> 01:14:35.969
<i>So too are all those slain by his hand.</i>

01:14:40.297 --> 01:14:44.465
<i>Now, you must pay.</i>

01:14:53.129 --> 01:14:56.506
<i>And so I awoke beneath that mountain,</i>

01:14:56.605 --> 01:15:01.017
<i>where my mother had
sacrificed her life for mine.</i>

01:15:01.042 --> 01:15:06.079
<i>Whilst out there,
the damned were stirring.</i>

01:16:01.972 --> 01:16:04.089
Fine flesh.

01:16:04.363 --> 01:16:08.074
Not as fair as I would wish,
but you'll fit him well.

01:16:12.340 --> 01:16:15.624
What breed was your mother?

01:16:17.195 --> 01:16:19.276
She was Scottish.

01:16:21.714 --> 01:16:24.114
Those Celts have lustre.

01:16:26.154 --> 01:16:29.625
And your father, was he...
pale skinned?

01:16:29.682 --> 01:16:31.812
"Pale"?

01:16:32.844 --> 01:16:35.175
He was invisible.

01:16:36.911 --> 01:16:42.715
Well, I'll soon have my boy again, once we
we patch him up with that fine skin of yours.

01:17:02.839 --> 01:17:05.766
At last. The entrance!

01:17:09.423 --> 01:17:12.612
Mosca, bring my boy.

01:17:13.457 --> 01:17:15.167
Kiss Cut!

01:17:15.432 --> 01:17:17.210
You my whore or what?

01:17:37.660 --> 01:17:40.499
Boss!

01:17:45.539 --> 01:17:47.653
You see this, Boss?

01:17:47.689 --> 01:17:54.039
It is called the Amenta.
It means: "The Land of the Dead."

01:17:56.228 --> 01:17:58.447
You don't take that path, Boss.

01:17:58.472 --> 01:18:04.502
But this one Boss, is called
the Ura-Buras Ati-Penukle,

01:18:04.582 --> 01:18:10.442
It means:
"Resurrection shall be found at the mountaintop."

01:18:10.802 --> 01:18:14.707
This the path, Boss.
I'm certain.

01:18:16.082 --> 01:18:17.807
Stay here.

01:18:19.729 --> 01:18:21.348
Bring my boy.

01:18:24.722 --> 01:18:28.569
Mosca? You know this
coat of mine you like so much?

01:18:28.594 --> 01:18:30.363
You just earned it.

01:18:31.505 --> 01:18:34.081
Thank you, Boss!
Thank you!

01:18:34.106 --> 01:18:37.677
Me, I like the cuffs.

01:19:08.492 --> 01:19:10.980
I blew you a kiss.

01:19:12.170 --> 01:19:16.534
And you blew me away.

01:19:16.839 --> 01:19:21.084
- I had no choice.
- So choose now.

01:19:22.046 --> 01:19:24.492
Knives or guns?

01:19:35.875 --> 01:19:37.805
Guns.

01:19:43.702 --> 01:19:45.555
Guns it is.

01:22:05.079 --> 01:22:06.865
I don't sleep.

01:22:07.616 --> 01:22:12.653
If I did,
one thought would keep from it.

01:22:14.646 --> 01:22:17.615
Why did my son not return?

01:22:19.186 --> 01:22:21.829
You brought death everyone of us.

01:22:35.124 --> 01:22:37.455
So tell me!

01:23:01.461 --> 01:23:04.130
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:23:22.802 --> 01:23:24.946
You any good with your left?

01:23:28.885 --> 01:23:31.094
I thought you wanted me dead.

01:23:34.759 --> 01:23:37.085
Well, dead ain't what it used to be.

01:24:48.011 --> 01:24:52.778
All this over one petty piece of pussy?

01:25:10.973 --> 01:25:13.219
He took his own life!

01:25:14.639 --> 01:25:16.478
My boy!

01:25:17.331 --> 01:25:19.019
My son!

01:25:43.012 --> 01:25:45.601
I'm a woman in need of rescue.

01:25:48.818 --> 01:25:50.969
What kind of man are you?

01:25:53.423 --> 01:25:55.626
I'm the heartless kind.

01:26:10.918 --> 01:26:13.067
Hey, come on.
I don't know how to be dead!

01:26:13.257 --> 01:26:16.077
No one taught you how to live!
