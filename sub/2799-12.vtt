WEBVTT

00:05.547 --> 00:09.051
I like the way you move?

00:11.053 --> 00:16.558
I like the way you put
your hands up in the air?

00:16.600 --> 00:20.562
I like the way
you stare so much?

00:21.063 --> 00:23.565
Yeah, most of all?

00:23.565 --> 00:27.569
I like the way you move.

00:47.089 --> 00:48.590
Hey, lady.

00:48.632 --> 00:50.092
Hey.

00:50.092 --> 00:54.096
I can't sleep.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.598
You want to try
to eat something?

00:56.640 --> 00:58.642
Yeah.

00:58.684 --> 01:00.602
Okay.

01:03.105 --> 01:04.105
All right.

01:04.105 --> 01:05.607
I'll go get Ahren.

01:06.108 --> 01:07.109
You go get dressed.

01:09.611 --> 01:10.612
Ahren?

01:14.116 --> 01:15.117
Ahren?

01:18.120 --> 01:19.121
Ahren?

01:23.125 --> 01:24.376
Ahren...

01:27.629 --> 01:29.631
Ahren...

01:31.633 --> 01:33.635
Ahren...

01:33.635 --> 01:37.639
Id, BRAS Okay, Ahren Gree n, 29 years o

01:38.140 --> 01:40.642
lives here with Bianca Desmond,
that's the brunette.

01:40.684 --> 01:43.187
The blonde
is Chelsea Wannamaker

01:43.228 --> 01:45.647
She was just
spending the night

01:45.647 --> 01:47.649
One was asleep,
one was in the bathroom.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.151
They said Ahren was probably
working on his bike.

01:52.154 --> 01:53.155
His pupils are dilated.

01:53.655 --> 01:55.157
Lividity is consistent
with body position.

01:55.657 --> 01:58.160
Looks like he bled out
from a stab wound

01:58.202 --> 02:00.162
to his upper leg
or pelvic area.

02:00.204 --> 02:01.663
Well, in my experience,

02:01.663 --> 02:04.666
I found that most threesomes
end up being one too many.

02:04.708 --> 02:06.460
So, David, uh...

02:06.502 --> 02:08.169
check and make sure

02:08.169 --> 02:09.670
that they didn't
pull a Lorena Bobbitt.

02:10.672 --> 02:12.174
Take a look.

02:20.682 --> 02:21.183
No, we're good.

02:21.683 --> 02:22.684
My man's all there.

02:22.726 --> 02:24.186
We're... good.

02:24.186 --> 02:25.187
Something must
be wrong his gear.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.189
He could be partying
with two hot chicks inside,

02:27.231 --> 02:28.690
but he's out here
working on his bike

02:28.732 --> 02:30.484
at 4:00 in the morning?

02:30.526 --> 02:32.194
Maybe he wasn't invited.

02:39.201 --> 02:42.204
Who... are you?

02:42.204 --> 02:45.207
Who, who, who, who?

02:45.707 --> 02:48.210
Who... are you?

02:48.210 --> 02:50.212
Who, who, who, who?

02:50.254 --> 02:52.256
I really wanna know?

02:52.297 --> 02:54.216
Who... are you?

02:54.716 --> 02:56.218
?Oh-oh-oh?
?Who...?

02:56.718 --> 02:59.721
Come on, tell me who are you,
you, you?

02:59.763 --> 03:01.723
Oh, you!?

03:08.230 --> 03:10.232
Hold out your hands, please.

03:13.235 --> 03:15.737
And the other side.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.744
What were you doing
right before Ahren was killed?

03:23.245 --> 03:25.747
Cleaning.

03:26.248 --> 03:27.499
With what?

03:27.541 --> 03:28.750
Bleach.

03:28.750 --> 03:30.752
It's the only thing that works

03:30.794 --> 03:31.753
Okay.

03:31.753 --> 03:33.255
You know, you could put
some clothes on if you want,

03:33.297 --> 03:34.756
if you're cold.

03:34.756 --> 03:37.259
She won't let
me back in my room.

04:10.792 --> 04:12.294
Man, I give this guy
an "A" for organization.

04:12.336 --> 04:14.838
He's got a spot for everything

04:14.880 --> 04:17.089
Why is that helmet over there?

04:17.132 --> 04:18.966
Maybe he threw it,

04:19.009 --> 04:20.802
defending himself.

04:29.311 --> 04:30.812
Yeah, but he looked like
he was in pretty good shape.

04:30.854 --> 04:32.814
It'd be kind of hard
for one of those women

04:32.856 --> 04:34.316
to wrestle him
down.

04:34.316 --> 04:37.319
Not if she walks softly
and carried a big knife.

04:37.361 --> 04:38.820
How long
have you known Ahren?

04:39.321 --> 04:41.323
Six months

04:41.323 --> 04:45.327
Did, uh, did he have any enemies
that you know of?

04:45.369 --> 04:48.830
No, I mean... I don't know.

04:48.872 --> 04:49.832
You don't know...

04:50.332 --> 04:51.333
I mean, you two
lived together right?

04:51.333 --> 04:54.336
Yeah, but we were still getting
to know each other.

04:54.378 --> 04:55.337
I see.

04:55.337 --> 04:56.839
We met one night at Light.

04:56.839 --> 05:00.843
He was in town for a motocross race.

05:00.884 --> 05:03.345
It was love
at first sight

05:03.345 --> 05:04.847
I asked him to come back here,

05:04.888 --> 05:08.350
and he never left.

05:08.350 --> 05:13.355
We actually just decided tonight
to move to Colorado together.

05:13.397 --> 05:16.149
What, just pick up
and leave all this?

05:16.191 --> 05:18.861
My father has a cabin
where we could stay.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.362
Did Ahren have a job?

05:20.362 --> 05:22.364
Yeah. Motocross racing.
Right.

05:22.406 --> 05:23.365
You said that.

05:23.866 --> 05:24.366
He's a professional athlete.

05:24.867 --> 05:26.368
And you, what about you?
What do you do?

05:26.410 --> 05:27.870
I'm in fashion.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.372
Mm-hm.

05:31.874 --> 05:32.875
What's the matter?

05:35.878 --> 05:37.880
I have the worst luck with men.

05:37.921 --> 05:40.883
What do you mean?

05:40.883 --> 05:44.887
They're either jerks
or they leave me,

05:45.387 --> 05:46.889
or they get killed

05:49.892 --> 05:51.894
What's wrong with me?

05:55.898 --> 05:57.399
What do you got?

05:57.399 --> 05:59.902
Well, I wasn't sure
if I should call it in

06:00.402 --> 06:01.904
as a 419 or a 401A.

06:01.945 --> 06:03.405
Hit and run?

06:03.906 --> 06:05.908
You tell me.

06:06.408 --> 06:08.911
know. STOKES: Mm, I don't

06:08.911 --> 06:11.413
When you run,
you usually take the car.

06:11.455 --> 06:13.415
The vic's Sylvia Mullins

06:13.415 --> 06:14.917
Works in one o f the offices upstairs.

06:15.417 --> 06:16.418
The security guard

06:16.460 --> 06:17.419
found her.

06:17.920 --> 06:19.421
Did you run the plates?

06:19.922 --> 06:21.423
That's why I went with the 419

06:21.465 --> 06:22.424
R.O.'s the vic.

06:29.932 --> 06:33.936
Hit with her own car
in her own spot.

06:33.936 --> 06:36.939
Ms. Mullins must have
be en working all night.

06:36.980 --> 06:37.981
You know, tax season.

06:38.023 --> 06:38.941
She's an accountant?

06:39.441 --> 06:42.444
Has her own firm up on 11.

06:42.444 --> 06:45.447
Did you see anything
on your monitors?

06:47.950 --> 06:49.451
Uh, no

06:49.451 --> 06:51.453
But I hear d the crash.

06:51.495 --> 06:53.455
I sort of fell asleep.

06:53.455 --> 06:55.457
We're going to need
to see your tapes.

06:55.958 --> 06:59.461
Cell phone, a shoe
and a briefcase.

06:59.503 --> 07:02.965
Probably lost th em all on impact.

07:03.465 --> 07:05.717
Looks like she s
aw the car coming

07:05.759 --> 07:07.970
Impact's pretty
evenly distributed.

07:08.470 --> 07:09.721
The car hit her
straight on.

07:09.763 --> 07:10.973
Most cars have to be going

07:11.473 --> 07:13.475
at least 14 miles an hour
to trigger the airbag.

07:18.480 --> 07:19.481
Well, I can't be sure,

07:19.481 --> 07:21.483
but it looks like somebody
popped the ignition.

07:23.485 --> 07:26.989
Carjacking gone bad?

07:26.989 --> 07:30.993
Vic gets off the elevator,
walks to her spot...

07:32.995 --> 07:34.997
...on the phone, distracted,

07:34.997 --> 07:36.999
catches the guy
stealing her ride...

07:50.512 --> 07:53.015
He runs her over and splits.

07:53.056 --> 07:55.017
Pedal to the metal.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.525
Hey.

08:03.525 --> 08:05.527
ALS is lighting
up everywhere

08:05.527 --> 08:08.030
Evidently she bleaches
everything.

08:08.030 --> 08:10.032
So there could be
some false positives.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.534
Yeah, including her teeth.

08:12.576 --> 08:14.536
Check out
the cabinet.

08:18.040 --> 08:20.792
Lots of teeth whitener
and acne cream.

08:20.834 --> 08:23.545
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

08:23.587 --> 08:25.088
Speed freak.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.548
Definitely.

08:26.548 --> 08:29.551
Maybe she killed Ahren in the garage

08:29.551 --> 08:31.553
then came up here to
take a Silkwood shower

08:38.059 --> 08:43.565
Okay, but she's claiming
she loved him.

08:43.607 --> 08:45.067
What's her motive?

08:45.067 --> 08:51.073
Uh, we started out at Light
and then we went to Road Runner,

08:51.114 --> 08:55.077
and from there we we re at Double Down,

08:55.118 --> 08:56.578
and then CopperK,

08:56.578 --> 08:58.580
and then we en ded up at Drai's.

08:58.580 --> 09:00.582
Drai's, that's
a good place to end.

09:00.624 --> 09:02.584
So what are you on
besides meth?

09:04.586 --> 09:06.338
Not meth.

09:06.380 --> 09:08.257
Glass.

09:08.298 --> 09:10.092
Uh-huh.

09:10.592 --> 09:12.594
We did some coke
at the club,

09:12.594 --> 09:14.596
had a couple of drinks,
and there was this guy

09:15.097 --> 09:17.099
Is, that gave us these,
uh, these blue pil

09:17.599 --> 09:20.102
but I had to c ome home and lie down.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.603
Ecstasy.

09:21.603 --> 09:24.356
We only do this when we're,
when we're clubbing.

09:24.398 --> 09:27.109
I mean, it's just a ho
bby, it's not a habit

09:27.609 --> 09:28.610
We have it under control.

09:28.610 --> 09:31.113
Well, the dead guy
from the garage

09:31.154 --> 09:32.614
might beg to differ.

09:37.619 --> 09:39.621
Eww, busy.

09:39.621 --> 09:45.127
If Bianca killed him, and then
came up here to take a shower,

09:45.169 --> 09:46.628
wouldn't she have left a trail

09:46.670 --> 09:48.630
Maybe.

10:08.150 --> 10:10.152
It appears she missed a spot.

11:11.213 --> 11:12.214
Las Vegas Coroner's Office

11:12.714 --> 11:14.216
David, it's Warrick.
Have you washed the body yet?

11:14.258 --> 11:15.217
I just got started,

11:15.217 --> 11:16.718
but I can be done by the time
you get here.

11:16.760 --> 11:18.220
No, stop.

11:18.220 --> 11:20.222
I, uh, just found a bullet.

11:20.264 --> 11:22.224
I have no idea who fired it.

11:22.224 --> 11:24.726
Do me a favor:
test his hands for GSR

11:25.227 --> 11:27.229
and run it through
the flouroscope.

11:27.729 --> 11:29.731
No problem.

11:29.773 --> 11:31.733
Thanks, David.

11:32.234 --> 11:34.736
Who brings a gun
to a knife fight?

11:36.238 --> 11:38.240
The winner

11:42.244 --> 11:43.745
The killer knew how
to steal a car.

11:43.787 --> 11:44.746
No prints?
No.

11:44.746 --> 11:48.125
No, it's wiped clean.

11:48.167 --> 11:49.251
Hey, Arch.

11:49.251 --> 11:51.753
You get anything off the
parking garage camera?

11:51.795 --> 11:54.256
Um, sort of.

11:56.258 --> 11:57.759
What's up
with the focus?

11:57.759 --> 11:58.760
That's what
I was wondering, too.

11:58.760 --> 12:02.264
Check out what happened
about an hour earlier.

12:05.767 --> 12:07.269
It's an old security cam

12:07.311 --> 12:08.812
Adjustable focus ring.

12:08.854 --> 12:10.272
Killer was camera shy.

12:10.314 --> 12:11.273
For good reason.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.275
This wasn't a carjacking
gone bad.

12:13.317 --> 12:14.276
It was premeditated.

12:14.776 --> 12:15.777
If he touched the camera,

12:15.777 --> 12:17.779
maybe I can get some prints
off it.

12:18.280 --> 12:19.781
Keep working
the video, Arch.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.783
See if you c an get us a fac e. Yeah.

12:21.783 --> 12:24.286
Fluoroscope
detected no bullets.

12:24.286 --> 12:26.788
But there are perimortem
bruises on his wrists

12:26.830 --> 12:29.791
and forearms,
look like defensive wounds.

12:29.833 --> 12:30.792
C.O.D.?

12:30.792 --> 12:32.044
The weapon went
pretty deep.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.295
Punctured the
femoral artery

12:33.295 --> 12:35.797
I'd say he bled out
in a matter of minutes,

12:35.839 --> 12:38.300
if his dilated
pupils are an indication

12:38.800 --> 12:39.801
of amphetamine s in his system.

12:39.801 --> 12:41.803
Faster the heart rate,
faster the blood pumps

12:41.845 --> 12:43.805
Now for the details.

12:43.847 --> 12:46.308
The fatal blow.

12:46.308 --> 12:48.810
Weapon appears to have
a triangular shape.

12:48.852 --> 12:51.605
Angle of ent ry was upwards.

12:51.647 --> 12:54.316
Like a cornada. I'm sorry.

12:54.358 --> 12:55.317
A cornada-

12:55.817 --> 12:58.820
occupational hazard
for matadors during a bullfight.

12:58.862 --> 13:00.822
The bull rears up
and gores them.

13:00.822 --> 13:02.824
So just find a bul
I with a bloody horn,

13:02.866 --> 13:03.825
and you've got your killer.

13:06.328 --> 13:10.332
So your "soda-can killer"
was a copper-washed. 22.

13:10.332 --> 13:12.334
Now I could only get general
rifling characteristics-

13:12.835 --> 13:14.336
six lands and grooves

13:14.336 --> 13:16.839
with a right-hand twist,
um, but...

13:17.339 --> 13:18.841
But not enough individual
characteristics

13:18.882 --> 13:20.133
to run it through IBIS

13:20.175 --> 13:21.760
Exactly. Sorry, man.

13:21.802 --> 13:23.345
That's all right.

13:23.387 --> 13:25.848
Hodges.

13:25.848 --> 13:29.351
Your victim did not have
GSR on his hands.

13:29.852 --> 13:32.354
Okay, what about
metallic trace

13:32.396 --> 13:33.355
from the garage floor?

13:33.355 --> 13:34.857
Thank you, Hodges,
for performing

13:35.357 --> 13:36.859
that incredibly
elaborate test

13:36.859 --> 13:40.362
requiring copious concentration
and an advanced degree.

13:40.404 --> 13:41.363
So you don't have
any results

13:41.864 --> 13:44.366
from the metallic trace
on the garage floor?

13:44.408 --> 13:46.869
But I will.

13:46.869 --> 13:48.871
That's the beauty of me.

14:19.902 --> 14:21.904
Well, Mr. Miller,
what I would recommend

14:21.945 --> 14:23.906
is adding some tax-deferred
investments

14:23.947 --> 14:24.907
to your portfolio.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.409
Like a ROTH IRA. That's
be perfect for you.

14:27.451 --> 14:29.411
I never got what that
ROTH stood for.

15:00.442 --> 15:01.443
Hey, Kelly. Have a seat.

15:01.443 --> 15:02.945
Thanks for seeing me.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.947
I know you said we didn't ha
ve to do this in person.

15:04.988 --> 15:07.241
No, I'm really glad you came

15:07.282 --> 15:09.451
Your father loved you very much.

15:09.493 --> 15:10.452
But too much.

15:10.452 --> 15:11.954
I just wanted to talk
about his estate.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.956
Is what he did
going to affect it?

15:13.956 --> 15:16.458
It's, um,
it's kind of complicated

15:29.471 --> 15:31.473
District Four,
Parole and Probation.

15:31.473 --> 15:33.976
Yeah, this is Nick Stokes
with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

15:34.017 --> 15:36.478
We're trying to reach
Kelly Gordon's parole officer.

15:36.520 --> 15:38.480
Mm-hmm, that's me.

15:38.480 --> 15:40.983
Great. I need Kelly's
contact information.

15:41.483 --> 15:44.486
Sure, but I gave her permission
to go out of town.

15:44.528 --> 15:46.989
Her bus left a few hours ago.

15:49.491 --> 15:50.993
Oh, hey, I'm glad you're here.

15:50.993 --> 15:52.995
I got the result s back from the blood

15:53.036 --> 15:53.996
on Bianca's bedroom floor.

15:54.496 --> 15:55.497
The dead guy?
Uh, no.

15:55.998 --> 15:59.251
It's a male, but it's
not a match to Ahren Green.

15:59.293 --> 16:02.504
Then I ran it through CODIS
and I actually got a hit.

16:02.546 --> 16:04.506
Justin Cole.

16:04.506 --> 16:06.508
He's in the system
for statutory rape

16:06.550 --> 16:08.051
a couple years back.

16:08.093 --> 16:09.511
Among other things.

16:14.016 --> 16:15.517
So, why am I here?

16:15.517 --> 16:17.519
What, you getting homesick
for the train tracks

16:18.020 --> 16:20.022
behind Union Plaza already?

16:22.524 --> 16:24.526
Bianca Desmond.

16:25.027 --> 16:27.529
Girl's like an oven in there.

16:28.030 --> 16:30.032
Used to love it in there.

16:32.034 --> 16:33.535
How long ago was that?

16:34.036 --> 16:36.538
A few months.

16:36.538 --> 16:40.542
Did you stop by recently
to check out the competition?

16:40.584 --> 16:43.545
No. We lost touch.

16:43.545 --> 16:45.547
So it wouldn't bother you
to know Bianca's moved on,

16:46.048 --> 16:47.549
she's living
with another guy.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.551
It was good while it lasted.

16:49.551 --> 16:51.553
We found your blood
in her bedroom.

16:51.595 --> 16:53.555
And her dead boyfriend
in the garage.

17:01.563 --> 17:04.066
That's funny?

17:04.107 --> 17:06.568
Nah.

17:06.568 --> 17:08.319
Just... Bianca's all
fun and games

17:08.362 --> 17:10.071
until someone
shoots you in the leg.

17:10.571 --> 17:11.573
When was that?

17:12.074 --> 17:14.576
Six months ago.

17:16.578 --> 17:18.579
Hey, sweetie,
I went shopping with my mom.

17:18.622 --> 17:21.083
I'll be home late.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.084
There's some candy for y
ou on the table.

17:22.125 --> 17:24.586
See you then, lover.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.595
Stay a
way from Bianca.

17:34.096 --> 17:36.598
So I packed my stuff and left.

17:36.640 --> 17:38.100
Did you report it?

17:38.100 --> 17:41.603
Nah. Still on probation for
that "she-looked-18" incident.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.605
This the guy who shot you?

17:45.107 --> 17:47.609
Didn't really get a good look.

17:47.651 --> 17:48.902
I was too busy bleeding.

17:48.944 --> 17:50.112
You go to the hospital?

17:50.612 --> 17:53.115
Sort of had my own
anesthesia thing going on.

17:53.615 --> 17:55.617
So whatever happened
to the bullet?

18:13.135 --> 18:18.640
Yeah, see, human tissue
sticks pretty darn good.

18:18.682 --> 18:20.142
And I can't scalpel it off,

18:20.142 --> 18:22.644
because I might damage
the bullet's characteristics.

18:22.686 --> 18:25.647
So, uh... so I guess we wait.

18:25.647 --> 18:28.150
Half of these tools don't match

18:28.192 --> 18:30.652
the size and the shape
of the wound.

18:30.652 --> 18:33.155
And the ones that
do, don't have blood on them.

18:33.197 --> 18:35.157
The killer could
have wiped it off.

18:35.657 --> 18:37.659
I don't see why the killer wou
Id have used a tool anyway,

18:37.701 --> 18:38.660
when he had a gun.

18:38.660 --> 18:40.662
Maybe Ahern disarmed him

18:41.163 --> 18:42.664
and he grabbed
whatever was handy.

18:49.671 --> 18:51.173
Take a look at this.

18:51.173 --> 18:52.925
This guy was tweaker organized.

18:52.966 --> 18:54.676
There's a place for everything

18:55.177 --> 18:57.179
Except for this.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.181
It's got no
space in the pegboard

18:59.223 --> 19:01.183
and it doesn't match
any of the sets.

19:01.225 --> 19:03.685
How about that?

19:05.687 --> 19:06.688
Print it.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.248
Hey, Tom Harper?

20:06.248 --> 20:08.250
Detective Jim Brass,
Las Vegas Police

20:08.292 --> 20:09.793
May I ask you a couple questions?

20:09.835 --> 20:11.253
Do you know
a Bianca Desmond

20:11.295 --> 20:12.754
Sounds familiar.

20:12.754 --> 20:16.258
You know she's
at 1330 Wildflower Lane.

20:16.300 --> 20:18.260
Oh, yeah, right. Her.

20:18.260 --> 20:21.763
I installed some DSL lines
there a few days ago.

20:21.805 --> 20:23.765
She answered the door
in her panties.

20:23.765 --> 20:26.768
uhSo you've got that h ard hat,
tool belt thing working for you, h

20:26.810 --> 20:28.270
I wish.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.272
Kind of girl that makes you
happy to be a man,

20:30.272 --> 20:32.524
know what I'm saying?
Yeah, I kind of remember.

20:32.566 --> 20:34.776
it Anyway, we found a
too I with your prints on

20:34.818 --> 20:36.778
in a garage,
next to a dead guy

20:36.820 --> 20:38.280
Whoa.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.282
I- I lost an awl
at a job recently.

20:40.782 --> 20:41.783
It must have been there.

20:41.783 --> 20:43.285
Well, we're going
to need to confirm that.

20:43.785 --> 20:46.288
Could you get me
a work order

20:46.330 --> 20:47.789
Yeah, sure.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.791
Um, I'll pull one
from the office.

20:49.833 --> 20:50.792
I'll run it right over.

20:54.796 --> 20:58.300
Kelly, where you going
in such a hurry?

20:58.342 --> 21:01.094
I have relatives in Provo.

21:01.136 --> 21:04.473
I was going to visit them.

21:04.515 --> 21:07.809
I cleared it with my P.O.

21:07.809 --> 21:11.063
You gonna tell me why
a state trooper

21:11.104 --> 21:14.483
pulled over my bus
and yanked me off?

21:14.525 --> 21:17.819
You know a lady named
Sylvia Mullins?

21:17.861 --> 21:18.820
Yeah.

21:18.820 --> 21:21.323
Did you have a meeting
with her yesterday?

21:21.365 --> 21:23.325
Yeah. So?

21:23.325 --> 21:26.829
So why did you have
a meeting with her

21:26.829 --> 21:31.333
Sylvia's handling
my dad's estate. Hmm.

21:31.375 --> 21:33.627
She's the trustee.

21:33.669 --> 21:35.838
What's going on here?

21:35.838 --> 21:38.841
Ms. Mullins was found
in her parking garage...

21:38.882 --> 21:41.343
crushed by her own car

21:41.844 --> 21:45.848
And you think I have
something to do with it.

21:45.889 --> 21:47.641
When you worked in the prison garage,

21:47.683 --> 21:49.518
did you just learn how
to fix cars

21:49.560 --> 21:51.353
or did you lea rn how to steal them?

21:51.395 --> 21:52.855
Are you kidding me?

21:52.855 --> 21:55.357
Does it look like
I'm kidding you?

21:55.399 --> 21:57.860
You waited for h er to get out of work

21:57.860 --> 22:00.863
so you could let her know
how you felt about her.

22:09.371 --> 22:12.875
Sylvia was my dad's friend

22:12.875 --> 22:15.878
She was helping me
get back on my feet.

22:15.919 --> 22:17.921
How I felt

22:17.963 --> 22:19.673
was grateful.

22:19.715 --> 22:21.383
CSI puts me

22:21.383 --> 22:24.887
in jail for something
I didn't do.

22:24.887 --> 22:26.889
dy Do you really think
I'm going to kill somebo

22:26.930 --> 22:28.891
the minute I get out?

22:30.392 --> 22:31.894
Hold out your hands.

22:33.896 --> 22:35.397
Hold out your hands.

22:35.397 --> 22:39.401
Ms. Mullins' air bag
deployed on impact

22:39.902 --> 22:41.403
Air bag dust gets everywhere.

22:44.907 --> 22:46.408
It's really hard
to get rid of.

22:46.450 --> 22:49.912
Not if it isn't there.

22:56.919 --> 22:58.921
So the soda can bullet
and the leg bullet

22:58.962 --> 22:59.922
are from the same gun?

23:00.422 --> 23:01.924
Yeah. Bobby was able
to pull more stria

23:01.924 --> 23:04.426
off the leg bullet,
but still no IBIS hits

23:04.468 --> 23:06.428
So what ab
out the phone guy, huh

23:06.428 --> 23:07.930
The utility man's
always a shade-ball.

23:07.971 --> 23:09.723
As much as I love
your generalizations,

23:09.765 --> 23:11.433
actually,
this time you're wrong.

23:11.433 --> 23:14.937
The metallic scrapes on the
garage floor were titanium.

23:15.437 --> 23:16.939
The phone guy's tool

23:16.939 --> 23:18.440
was carbon steel.
Remember we thought

23:18.482 --> 23:19.942
that they
might be dealing meth?

23:19.983 --> 23:21.443
Brass went ahead

23:21.443 --> 23:24.196
and subpoenaed
the phone and bank records.

23:24.238 --> 23:26.949
Guess who's paying
Bianca's mortgage?

23:26.990 --> 23:27.950
A Mr. Harry Desmond.

23:28.450 --> 23:29.451
Happy Harry?

23:29.451 --> 23:30.452
Gas n' Sip Harry Desmond

23:30.953 --> 23:32.454
Who's your daddy?

23:32.454 --> 23:33.455
No wonder she didn't work.

23:33.455 --> 23:35.457
He owns 50 Gas n' Sips in Vegas.

23:35.457 --> 23:38.210
Well, Harry was nice enough
to leave us a voice message

23:38.252 --> 23:40.963
that was listened to and saved
the night of the murder.

23:41.964 --> 23:44.466
Bianca, sweetie, it's Daddy.

23:44.466 --> 23:46.468
I got your message about
moving to Colorado with Ahren.

23:46.510 --> 23:47.469
You can borrow the cabin,

23:47.970 --> 23:48.971
but we need
to talk about this move.

23:49.012 --> 23:50.973
Call me, Princess. I love you.

23:51.014 --> 23:51.974
And this

23:51.974 --> 23:53.976
is the Desmond cabin
in Telluride.

23:54.017 --> 23:55.978
Wow. maybe Mr. Desmond

23:55.978 --> 23:57.479
is trying to protect
the family fortune.

23:57.980 --> 23:59.481
Or the family jewels.

24:00.482 --> 24:01.483
I got the results back

24:01.483 --> 24:03.485
from all those sex stains
on the sheets.

24:03.986 --> 24:06.989
Three donors:
Ahren, Bianca and Chelsea.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.992
I guess theywerehaving
a little threesome.

24:10.033 --> 24:11.994
Yeah, I just really hope

24:11.994 --> 24:14.997
he was only doing one woman
at a time.

24:15.497 --> 24:17.499
Chelsea is Bianca's mother

24:23.088 --> 24:25.090
like Look, I kn ow what it's

24:25.090 --> 24:28.093
to want to kill
your daughter's boyfriend.

24:28.135 --> 24:31.096
I don't pick fights
that I can't win.

24:31.138 --> 24:33.599
I kill this one,

24:33.599 --> 24:35.601
I got five more dipsticks
waiting to take his place.

24:35.642 --> 24:37.603
I'd just be pushing
the rock up the hill.

24:37.644 --> 24:39.104
Besides,

24:39.104 --> 24:40.606
I was in New York
yesterday.

24:40.606 --> 24:43.108
Yeah, but you didn't want
them to move away together.

24:43.609 --> 24:45.110
I wanted Bianca to get a job.

24:45.611 --> 24:47.112
My biggest mistake
in life?

24:47.112 --> 24:49.615
Giving my baby everything
she ever wanted.

24:49.615 --> 24:52.117
Your wife doesn't seem to mi
nd her lifestyle.

24:52.117 --> 24:58.624
When Bianca was a teenager,
they fought like cats in a sack.

24:59.124 --> 25:01.627
It's good they've been
spending time together.

25:03.629 --> 25:05.130
Do you know what they're doing

25:05.130 --> 25:09.635
Well... they're shopping,
dancing...

25:09.676 --> 25:11.136
You know, girl stuff.

25:11.136 --> 25:14.640
They're sleeping
with the same man.

25:26.151 --> 25:30.155
Look...

25:30.155 --> 25:31.156
there was no good reason

25:31.657 --> 25:33.659
for Chelsea to marry me
back in the day.

25:33.700 --> 25:36.161
I had a little money.

25:36.161 --> 25:38.163
Nothing like
what we have now.

25:38.163 --> 25:43.669
She was half my age
and ten times better looking.

25:43.710 --> 25:47.673
I thought if I kept her
on a long

25:47.714 --> 25:52.678
leash...

25:53.178 --> 25:55.681
maybe she'd never stray
that far.

25:55.681 --> 25:59.184
You the kind of guy that likes
to keep guns in the house?

25:59.226 --> 26:01.186
Yeah, of course.

26:01.186 --> 26:03.188
I'm going to need to see them.

26:05.691 --> 26:08.193
Hey, Catherine,

26:08.193 --> 26:10.696
I just got back trace on
Kelly Gordon's fingernails.

26:10.737 --> 26:13.198
I was looking for, you know,
air bag dust,

26:13.240 --> 26:15.200
but all Hodges found was air.

26:15.242 --> 26:16.702
Well, join the club.

26:16.702 --> 26:20.455
No usable prints on the
parking garage camera either.

26:20.497 --> 26:24.209
Okay, I'll have Sofia release
her from holding.

26:24.251 --> 26:25.711
Those the vic's phone records?

26:26.211 --> 26:26.712
Yeah.

26:27.212 --> 26:27.713
From her office.

26:28.213 --> 26:29.715
Lots of international calls.

26:29.756 --> 26:31.216
Hmm.

26:31.717 --> 26:33.218
A lot of 345
Mm-hmm.

26:33.260 --> 26:34.511
Where's that?

26:34.553 --> 26:35.721
Cayman Islands

26:36.221 --> 26:38.223
Popular with scuba
div ers and money launderers.

26:38.265 --> 26:40.225
I called a few of
the numbers; all banks.

26:40.267 --> 26:42.227
Suggests offshore accounts.

26:42.227 --> 26:44.229
It's not illegal,
but it is very anonymous.

26:44.730 --> 26:46.732
It's also a good w ay to siphon
money away from your clients.

26:47.232 --> 26:48.233
That's a leap.

26:48.734 --> 26:52.237
Hey, somebody wanted
this woman dead.

27:17.763 --> 27:19.264
Hi, CSI guy.

27:19.264 --> 27:22.768
You wondering why you're here?

27:22.809 --> 27:26.271
Because you followed
the evidence.

27:26.313 --> 27:29.274
Because that's what CSIs do.

27:29.775 --> 27:35.781
So breathe quick, breathe slow,
put your gun in your mouth

27:35.823 --> 27:37.783
and pull the trigger.

27:37.783 --> 27:42.788
Any way you like,
you're going to die here

27:42.830 --> 27:46.291
Okay. Perfect.

27:51.797 --> 27:55.300
You're going to die here

27:55.342 --> 27:58.303
Okay. Perfect.

28:02.307 --> 28:03.308
Hey, Archie.

28:03.308 --> 28:04.309
Hey, I did my best

28:04.309 --> 28:05.811
to enhance
the parking garage footage,

28:05.811 --> 28:09.314
but I just can't get an image
on the killer's face.

28:09.815 --> 28:10.816
If you got a coupl e of minutes,

28:10.858 --> 28:11.817
I need a voice comparison.

28:11.859 --> 28:13.819
Yeah, what do you got?

28:13.819 --> 28:15.821
Kelly Gordon's voice on tape

28:17.322 --> 28:18.323
I want to see
if it's the other voice

28:18.824 --> 28:20.325
on the Walter Gordon
audio file.

28:20.367 --> 28:22.828
Grissom told you.

28:22.828 --> 28:24.830
No, but he obviously
told you.

28:26.832 --> 28:28.333
Nick, uh...

28:28.333 --> 28:29.585
You know what?
Forget about it.

28:29.626 --> 28:30.836
If this girl's involved,

28:30.836 --> 28:32.337
that means she's capable
of murder.

28:32.838 --> 28:33.839
It's all cued up for you.

28:33.881 --> 28:35.340
Her voice is first

28:35.340 --> 28:38.343
Grissom, it's Warrick.

28:38.343 --> 28:41.847
None of the guns Bobby
test-fired were a match

28:41.889 --> 28:42.848
to the bullets,

28:42.848 --> 28:46.852
but Chelsea Wannamaker purchased
a. 22 in her name

28:46.852 --> 28:52.357
that was not picked up with
the warrant for Harry's guns

28:52.399 --> 28:54.860
Okay. I'm on it.

28:59.865 --> 29:01.867
Mrs. Wannamaker.

29:05.370 --> 29:08.373
Wow, that's a hell of a rock.

29:08.373 --> 29:10.876
I'm surp rised I didn't
see that the other night.

29:11.376 --> 29:12.878
Well, I don't feel safe
wearing this to a club.

29:12.920 --> 29:14.379
Is that why you own a gun?

29:14.880 --> 29:16.882
Well, I used to.

29:16.882 --> 29:18.884
But my gun was stolen
out of my purse,

29:19.384 --> 29:20.385
one night when we went out.

29:21.887 --> 29:24.890
Is there something you want
to say to me?

29:24.890 --> 29:28.393
You trying to buy back some time
there, Mrs. Wannamaker?

29:28.435 --> 29:32.397
Life's short,
but it doesn't end at 40.

29:32.439 --> 29:34.399
Oh, I agree with you.

29:34.399 --> 29:36.401
But it must be tough for Bianca

29:36.401 --> 29:39.905
to have the kind of mother
that'd s leep with her boyfriend

29:41.907 --> 29:44.910
The thing with Ahren
the other night

29:44.952 --> 29:46.912
shouldn't have happened.

29:46.954 --> 29:50.707
We were on Ecstasy...

29:50.749 --> 29:54.419
and a line got crossed.

29:54.461 --> 29:55.921
Oh, yeah.

29:56.421 --> 29:57.923
Just lay d own right here. Okay.

29:57.923 --> 30:00.425
I'll get you some
water. Oh, come back.

30:00.467 --> 30:01.927
All right,
you come right back.

30:20.946 --> 30:23.949
Oh, Chelsea, I'm... I'm sorry.

30:24.449 --> 30:25.951
I totally thought
you were Bianca.

30:25.993 --> 30:28.954
That felt so good.

30:39.464 --> 30:44.469
Bianca came in and found us.

30:46.972 --> 30:49.474
I wish it never would have
happened.

30:49.474 --> 30:52.978
What's that, getting busy
with her boyfriend

30:53.020 --> 30:53.979
or getting caught?

30:53.979 --> 30:55.480
I went into the living room

30:55.981 --> 30:58.483
and I let the two of them
talk it out.

30:58.525 --> 30:59.985
Next thing I know,

30:59.985 --> 31:01.987
she announced that
they were moving to Colorado,

31:02.029 --> 31:05.491
so it seemed to me
like they worked it out.

31:09.995 --> 31:11.497
Freud would have a field day

31:11.538 --> 31:12.498
with this family.

31:12.498 --> 31:13.499
Dad loves his daughter,

31:13.499 --> 31:16.001
but Mom only sees the
daughter as competition.

31:16.502 --> 31:19.004
And everyone wonders why
Bianca can't meet a nice boy.

31:19.046 --> 31:21.006
Bianca eats nice
boys for brunch.

31:31.517 --> 31:33.018
Las Vegas Crime Lab.

31:33.519 --> 31:35.521
Watch yourself.

31:35.562 --> 31:37.523
Mm-hmm.

31:46.532 --> 31:48.534
Oh. Sara.

31:50.035 --> 31:51.036
Bianca,

31:51.036 --> 31:53.038
can you hear me?

31:53.038 --> 31:55.040
We need an ambulance.

31:55.040 --> 31:58.544
Dispatch, this is CSI Brown.

31:58.544 --> 32:00.045
We have a woman down.
We need a paramedic.

32:10.055 --> 32:11.557
Hey, Bianca.

32:11.598 --> 32:13.058
How you feeling?

32:15.561 --> 32:17.062
Mr. and Mrs. Desmond...

32:17.104 --> 32:19.064
It's Wannamaker.

32:19.064 --> 32:20.566
She's never changed her name

32:20.566 --> 32:22.818
Ms. Wannamaker, I'm going to need

32:22.860 --> 32:25.070
a few moments alone
with Bianca.

32:36.081 --> 32:39.084
You never should've told him

32:39.084 --> 32:42.087
My father's an optimist.
How do you think

32:42.588 --> 32:44.089
they stayed married
for 20 years?

32:44.089 --> 32:48.594
Bianca, I'm going to assume
that whoever did this to you

32:48.635 --> 32:51.597
also killed Ahren.

32:51.597 --> 32:54.099
And I'm also going to assume

32:54.141 --> 32:56.602
that you know
who that is.

32:59.605 --> 33:01.106
I think you need

33:01.106 --> 33:03.609
to stop protecting everyone
from themselves.

33:03.650 --> 33:05.611
I can't.

33:09.615 --> 33:11.617
Excuse me.

33:11.617 --> 33:13.118
I just need to check
the swelling.

33:15.120 --> 33:16.622
How's the tenderness?

33:16.663 --> 33:18.624
It's fine.

33:22.127 --> 33:23.128
I hope you feel better.

33:27.633 --> 33:30.135
Nurse... Nurse

33:30.135 --> 33:32.137
Can I get that glove
you were just using?

33:32.137 --> 33:34.640
I'm Sara Sidle. I'm
with the Las Vegas Crime Lab.

33:36.141 --> 33:38.143
Here you go.

33:38.143 --> 33:41.647
Thanks. Uh, I'm also goi
to wait around for the SAE kit.

33:42.147 --> 33:43.649
She refused.

33:49.655 --> 33:51.156
Hey, Grissom...

33:51.156 --> 33:52.658
You want to talk to me?

33:52.699 --> 33:55.160
Yeah, sit down.

33:59.164 --> 34:02.167
I heard that Kelly Gordon

34:02.167 --> 34:04.169
may be a suspect
in your murder case.

34:04.211 --> 34:05.671
Yeah.

34:05.671 --> 34:07.172
Is that a problem?

34:07.214 --> 34:09.675
No.

34:09.675 --> 34:11.176
No, it's not a problem.

34:11.176 --> 34:14.679
And by the way,
I heard the tape.

34:14.721 --> 34:16.681
I did a voice comparison.

34:17.181 --> 34:17.683
Like a ROTH IRA.

34:18.183 --> 34:20.185
Now that would be perfect
for you.

34:20.185 --> 34:23.688
Sylvia Mullins is the other
voice on that tape.

34:23.688 --> 34:26.692
She's Walter Gordon's
ex-business manager, so...

34:27.192 --> 34:29.194
I'm pretty sure she had

34:29.194 --> 34:30.696
something to do
with my kidnapping.

34:33.197 --> 34:34.699
But now she's dead.

34:34.741 --> 34:38.203
Yeah.

34:38.203 --> 34:41.206
So... it's over.

34:44.710 --> 34:45.960
Yeah.

34:46.003 --> 34:47.212
Good.

34:48.714 --> 34:49.715
Good.

34:59.725 --> 35:03.729
SIDL Look, Bianca
is covering for someone.

35:03.729 --> 35:06.732
Well, we figured out the sticky
stuff on Bianca's neck

35:06.773 --> 35:09.234
was creosote
- it's a timber preservative

35:09.234 --> 35:13.739
found on fences, telephone poles
and railroad ties.

35:13.780 --> 35:15.532
Justin lives on
the train tracks.

35:15.574 --> 35:17.242
And he's pretty tweaked out.

35:17.743 --> 35:19.995
Yeah, but he didn' ’’t shoot himself.

35:20.037 --> 35:22.247
And I think th at if he had done it,

35:22.289 --> 35:25.751
Bianca would've told us.

35:25.792 --> 35:27.753
What is it?

35:27.753 --> 35:29.755
Telephone poles.

35:30.255 --> 35:34.259
Tom Harper's work order
for Bianca's DSL line

35:34.301 --> 35:36.762
was dated December 18.

35:36.803 --> 35:39.806
December 18...

35:39.848 --> 35:42.768
fell on a Sunday.

35:43.268 --> 35:45.270
How many workers y
ou know work on a Sunday?

35:45.312 --> 35:47.773
Is this the original document?

35:47.814 --> 35:48.774
Yeah.

35:49.274 --> 35:50.776
I'm on it.

35:50.776 --> 35:52.778
Always the utility guy.

36:36.822 --> 36:40.325
There were two different inks
on the work order,

36:40.826 --> 36:44.329
which means the date on
the work order was compromised.

36:44.371 --> 36:47.124
Tom Harper made a service call
to Bianca's house

36:47.166 --> 36:49.835
not in December, but ten months
earlier, in February.

36:49.877 --> 36:51.837
Why would the guy lie?

36:51.837 --> 36:54.339
It appears that
he was a lot more to her

36:54.840 --> 36:55.340
than just the phone guy.

36:55.841 --> 36:58.343
Our bachelorette
was a very busy girl.

36:58.343 --> 37:02.347
Phone calls from Bianca to Tom
are in yellow,

37:02.389 --> 37:04.641
from Bianca to Justin
are in blue,

37:04.683 --> 37:06.852
and from Bianca to Ahren
are in pink.

37:07.352 --> 37:08.353
There was always overlap.

37:08.353 --> 37:10.856
Bachelor number one:
Tom, phone guy-

37:10.856 --> 37:14.860
strong showing from
February 18 until June-ish.

37:14.902 --> 37:16.361
She called him two, three times a day.

37:16.403 --> 37:18.363
And then around June 5,

37:18.864 --> 37:21.867
bachelor number two
enters the picture- Justin.

37:21.909 --> 37:23.368
Ten days of overlap

37:23.368 --> 37:26.872
and then all the calls to Tom
stopped until...

37:26.914 --> 37:28.874
The week Justin was shot
and moved out.

37:28.916 --> 37:29.875
Exactly.

37:29.875 --> 37:31.877
Ahren entered the picture

37:31.877 --> 37:34.880
about five days later
in mid-September.

37:35.380 --> 37:36.381
At that poin t, all the phone calls

37:36.381 --> 37:39.384
to the other guys
stopped until just about

37:39.426 --> 37:40.385
a week ago.

37:40.385 --> 37:42.387
When she started
calling Tom again.

37:42.387 --> 37:45.390
Every time this chick calls Tom,
somebody gets shot.

37:45.432 --> 37:46.391
It's like thermite.

37:46.892 --> 37:47.893
Thermite?

37:47.893 --> 37:51.897
When you combine two seemingly
harmless elements-

37:51.939 --> 37:53.398
aluminum and rust-

37:53.398 --> 37:54.900
press them together, add heat...

37:54.900 --> 37:58.403
it creates an explosion so hot
it'll burn through steel

37:58.445 --> 38:00.405
Powerful
but uncontrollable.

38:00.447 --> 38:01.406
It burns and burns

38:01.907 --> 38:03.909
until it burns itself out,

38:03.909 --> 38:05.911
finally consuming both elements.

38:05.911 --> 38:08.413
I guess some people
just shouldn't be together

38:20.926 --> 38:22.928
Tom Harper! Come on down!

38:26.932 --> 38:29.434
You made me find you twice,
Tom, that's a drag.

38:29.935 --> 38:31.436
What's the problem

38:31.436 --> 38:33.188
You know, I think you saw Bianca

38:33.230 --> 38:34.940
in her panties
more than once.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.442
Now those could change a man.

38:39.444 --> 38:41.947
And it looks like they did.

38:43.448 --> 38:46.451
You know,
it's fill in the blank.

38:46.451 --> 38:48.453
If it walks like a stalker,
talks like a stalker...

38:48.495 --> 38:49.997
I'm not a stalker.

38:50.038 --> 38:51.498
Then what's this?

38:51.540 --> 38:52.958
Excellent service?

38:52.958 --> 38:56.461
Here's the top of the telephon
pole near Bianca's house.

38:56.503 --> 38:59.464
Ahren was tapping
your girl,

38:59.464 --> 39:00.966
so you started tapping
her phone.

39:02.968 --> 39:05.470
I only listened when
I thought she was in trouble

39:05.470 --> 39:07.973
Look, her father called her
at 7:00 a. m. New York time,

39:08.015 --> 39:09.766
that's 4:00 in the morning
in Vegas.

39:09.808 --> 39:11.476
You had to be
on the pole to hear it

39:11.476 --> 39:13.979
because we were on the scene
an hour later.

39:14.021 --> 39:16.481
Bianca, sweetie, it's Daddy.

39:16.481 --> 39:19.485
I got your message about moving
to Colorado with Ahren.

39:20.986 --> 39:22.488
Stay away from Bianca.

39:22.529 --> 39:23.489
Who are you?

39:23.489 --> 39:25.491
You're not taking her
to Colorado.

39:25.991 --> 39:26.992
The hell I'm not.

39:52.518 --> 39:54.770
I just wanted her to be happy.

39:54.811 --> 39:56.939
With you and no one else.
No

39:56.980 --> 39:59.024
Those other guys were jerks.

39:59.024 --> 40:01.026
I only wan ted to scare him off.

40:01.026 --> 40:03.529
Oh, like you did with Justin?
That worked.

40:03.529 --> 40:05.531
Yeah, but Bianca didn't co
me running back to you,

40:05.572 --> 40:06.532
so I guess
you had to scare her, too.

40:07.032 --> 40:09.034
What are you doing here?

40:09.076 --> 40:10.035
I came to see you.

40:10.035 --> 40:11.537
ve. I think you should lea

40:12.037 --> 40:13.038
Your mom wants us
to be together.

40:13.539 --> 40:14.540
My mom?!

40:14.581 --> 40:16.041
Go!

40:18.544 --> 40:21.547
und Her mother and I weren't
always going to be aro

40:21.588 --> 40:23.048
to clean up her messes

40:23.090 --> 40:25.050
Wait a minute.

40:25.050 --> 40:28.554
Are you telling me that Chelsea
asked you to hurt these guys?

40:31.056 --> 40:35.561
So you have some lunatic
stalker telephone repairman

40:35.561 --> 40:39.565
claiming that I told him to kill
my daughter's boyfriends?

40:39.606 --> 40:41.066
Give me a break.

40:41.066 --> 40:43.569
se We have multiple calls
to him from Bianca's hou

40:43.610 --> 40:45.070
and it was not her.

40:45.070 --> 40:46.572
ord We also have on the rec

40:46.572 --> 40:49.074
that you called him
from your cell

40:49.074 --> 40:50.075
Coincidentally, right around the time

40:50.576 --> 40:52.578
Justin was sho t and Ahren was killed.

40:53.078 --> 40:56.081
We call that solicitation
for murder.

40:56.081 --> 40:58.083
But you'd probably call it,
what, good mothering?

40:58.125 --> 40:59.585
I love my daughter.

40:59.585 --> 41:02.087
Yeah, apparently, a lot
of her boyfriends, too

41:02.129 --> 41:05.090
Yeah, I called Tom.

41:05.090 --> 41:07.843
I asked him
to scare Justin away.

41:07.885 --> 41:10.262
He was after Bianca
for her money.

41:10.304 --> 41:12.598
I mean, we have
to protect ourselves.

41:12.598 --> 41:16.602
Yeah, but Ahren didn't love her
for her money.

41:16.643 --> 41:19.605
What was wrong with him?

41:19.605 --> 41:23.609
So he was good enough for you,
but too good for your daughter,

41:24.109 --> 41:25.110
was that it?

41:25.110 --> 41:27.112
I mean, finding a
so ul mate is hard enough,

41:27.112 --> 41:30.115
but competing with your
mother, that shouldn't be an issue.

41:30.157 --> 41:34.119
That goes against...
I don't know, nature.

41:34.620 --> 41:38.123
I was attracted to Ahren...

41:38.123 --> 41:43.128
and I was just trying to keep
him away from Bianca and me.

41:43.629 --> 41:46.131
Lady, you unleashed
an unstable man

41:46.131 --> 41:47.633
that you knew was in I
ove with your daughter

41:49.635 --> 41:52.137
You had to know that that
was not going to end well.

41:55.641 --> 41:57.893
Oh, hey, Nick.

41:57.935 --> 42:00.145
Nick.
Yeah?

42:00.646 --> 42:02.147
We caught a break.

42:02.147 --> 42:04.650
The security gua rd confessed.

42:04.691 --> 42:06.151
No.

42:06.652 --> 42:07.653
Archie isolated

42:08.153 --> 42:11.156
a frame of the killer
turning the focus ring.

42:20.165 --> 42:22.167
She did it.

42:30.175 --> 42:32.177
Las Vegas Police!
Open up!

42:38.684 --> 42:39.685
Kelly Gordon,
you're under arrest

42:40.185 --> 42:41.186
for the murder
of Sylvia Mullins.

42:41.687 --> 42:43.438
Stand up.

42:43.480 --> 42:45.190
Stand up!

42:50.195 --> 42:51.697
Care why I did it?

42:51.697 --> 42:54.199
Doesn't really matter now.

42:54.199 --> 42:57.703
She told me my dad
didn't leave me anything

42:57.744 --> 42:59.705
He never would've
done that.

42:59.746 --> 43:02.207
He loved me.

43:02.708 --> 43:04.209
So you killed her?

43:04.209 --> 43:05.961
The ransom was her idea.

43:06.003 --> 43:07.713
She didn't get
the money.

43:08.213 --> 43:09.715
She took it from me.

43:14.219 --> 43:15.721
now. She's ODin g. She's ODing right

43:15.762 --> 43:16.722
Call a paramedic.

43:16.722 --> 43:18.724
Vicodine, INH, methadone.

43:18.765 --> 43:21.226
Kelly! Kelly!

43:21.268 --> 43:23.228
Kelly!
