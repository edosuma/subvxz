00:12.179 --> 00:14.296
Reva, I'm home!

00:14.473 --> 00:16.465
Where are you?

00:20.437 --> 00:21.644
Reva.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.608
- Hi.
- How can you concentrate with that...

00:27.778 --> 00:30.065
- ...playing so loud?
- Keeps me focused.

00:30.239 --> 00:34.233
- Your grades don't show it.
- Don't start, okay?

00:35.494 --> 00:38.453
You want help? I'm good with numbers.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.786
I got it. Do you wanna eat?
Dinner's ready.

00:41.959 --> 00:43.825
In a bit. I have a work meeting.

00:45.254 --> 00:48.292
Sorry, what can I do? It's work.

00:48.465 --> 00:50.206
Whatever.

01:07.985 --> 01:09.146
<i>I detest waiting.</i>

01:09.319 --> 01:11.732
Tell me something worth waiting for.

01:12.197 --> 01:14.985
We have a deal.
I have what you're looking for.

01:15.158 --> 01:18.242
- When do I get it?
- If Garvey ever finds out...

01:18.412 --> 01:21.246
He won't. Leave now.
You can be here in 30 minutes.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.740
Wait. No...

01:25.252 --> 01:27.039
What...? Jerry? Jerry?

01:32.259 --> 01:33.500
What happened?

01:33.677 --> 01:35.760
Nothing good.

01:45.647 --> 01:48.606
Forensics says their report
will be ready later today.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.601
I promised that we would protect him.

01:52.237 --> 01:54.399
- That I would protect him.
- Aram...

01:54.573 --> 01:57.486
...we're gonna find out
whoever took this witness.

01:57.659 --> 02:01.027
Tony Mejia was gonna testify
that he saw Ian Garvey murder a cop.

02:01.204 --> 02:04.538
Thanks to me, he probably never will.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.913
Whoa, wait. Is that what I think it is?

02:09.503 --> 02:13.418
It was my grandmother's.
Amethyst is Samar's birthstone.

02:13.592 --> 02:16.551
Now, here I thought
you were all doom and gloom.

02:18.513 --> 02:21.426
- When are you gonna pop the question?
- What?

02:21.600 --> 02:23.136
No. No, no, no.

02:23.310 --> 02:26.144
This is not an engagement ring,
it's just a ring.

02:26.313 --> 02:29.727
You've dated for over a year.
You give her "just a ring"...

02:29.900 --> 02:33.109
- ...she'll think it's a proposal.
- Insane. How can she think that...

02:33.278 --> 02:36.112
- ...if I don't propose?
- I can guess what a woman will do...

02:36.281 --> 02:38.898
...but why she does it, I got no clue.

02:39.076 --> 02:42.319
- Apparently, I don't either.
- Why don't you ask one?

02:42.496 --> 02:43.782
Hey. What's up?

02:43.955 --> 02:48.825
Yeah. I wanna ask you about the feeds
from when I lost Tony Mejia.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.995
You didn't lose him. Garvey took him
in a sophisticated attack.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.916
I've been telling him that. Good luck
making him believe it wasn't his fault.

02:56.093 --> 02:59.552
He's looked at mug shots day and night,
trying to identify the man he saw.

02:59.721 --> 03:03.590
Trying and failing with the ID
and surveillance feeds. Three feeds...

03:03.767 --> 03:06.851
...from three businesses,
blacked out minutes before the attack.

03:07.020 --> 03:11.606
Means you were vectored to that point.
Garvey knew where you'd be and when.

03:12.067 --> 03:14.980
Feeds are worthless.
We're back to square one.

03:22.119 --> 03:23.155
Good morning.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.579
I hope you have indigestion.

03:26.748 --> 03:29.741
No. If it makes you feel better,
I'm in a bad mood.

03:29.918 --> 03:33.161
- Excellent.
- He's making fenugreek porridge.

03:33.338 --> 03:37.673
My ancestors learned that it cures
troubled stomachs and soothes pains.

03:37.843 --> 03:42.338
- Medicinal South Sudanese cuisine.
- Cooking it up in their embassy's kitchen.

03:42.514 --> 03:45.097
- Aren't you living large?
- Thanks to Dembe.

03:45.267 --> 03:48.101
His cousin was recently named
foreign minister.

03:48.270 --> 03:50.887
Of a country without an extradition treaty.
Convenient.

03:51.064 --> 03:54.023
I'm not here hiding
from American law enforcement.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.730
I can dodge those raindrops
and never get wet.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.567
I'm here because of Garvey.
You should be too, for your protection...

04:00.741 --> 04:04.075
- ...and to cure what ails you.
- Garvey is what ails me.

04:04.244 --> 04:08.534
He took our witness. I'm trying
to retrace how it happened, but...

04:08.707 --> 04:11.575
- If there's anything you can do.
- You bring the file?

04:12.169 --> 04:15.583
- Will you help or not?
- I'm trying to.

04:15.756 --> 04:18.248
Are you saying
this is connected to Garvey?

04:18.425 --> 04:21.088
Jerry Jawal wasn't just a port manager.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.925
He was an important associate
for the Nash Syndicate.

04:25.098 --> 04:28.762
The man responsible for bringing
product into the country safely...

04:28.935 --> 04:30.927
...and with proper documentation.

04:31.938 --> 04:36.103
He was killed yesterday
while talking on the phone to me.

04:36.276 --> 04:38.939
If he worked for Nash,
why'd he talk to you?

04:39.112 --> 04:42.401
He worked with Nash, not for them.
I've known Jerry for some time.

04:42.574 --> 04:45.487
We were in the process
of making a deal.

04:45.660 --> 04:50.496
He'd agreed to bring me a ledger,
a list of every Nash Syndicate shipment...

04:50.665 --> 04:54.500
...and its point of origin
for the last 14 months.

04:54.669 --> 04:59.414
Think Garvey found out and killed him?
Our agents have a different explanation.

04:59.591 --> 05:02.959
There's no mention
of a ledger recovered at the scene.

05:03.136 --> 05:07.096
They think it was a hate crime. Safe was
cleaned out, maybe the ledger was in it.

05:07.265 --> 05:10.008
To make a hate crime look
like a robbery?

05:10.185 --> 05:12.598
Now I have indigestion.

05:12.771 --> 05:14.387
Tell me your theory.

05:14.564 --> 05:18.103
Who's your hater
and what does he hate?

05:18.276 --> 05:21.360
Coogan Hudnutt,
publisher of <i>National Pride Weekly...</i>

05:21.530 --> 05:25.365
...and founder of the alt-right group
known as the United Brigade.

05:25.534 --> 05:29.278
A neo-Nazi with a fancy vocabulary
hiding good old-fashioned fascism...

05:29.454 --> 05:33.824
- ...behind America-first doublespeak.
- The Bureau thinks he killed Jawal.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.289
When Jawal took over the port
in Baltimore, he changed management.

05:37.462 --> 05:41.547
- Hired his own countrymen from India.
- If they're supplying opium to Nash...

05:41.716 --> 05:44.083
...it makes sense
he'd want his own crew in charge.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.924
Hudnutt and his band
weren't onboard with that idea.

05:47.097 --> 05:49.714
They made threats.
Then a stevedore got stabbed.

05:49.891 --> 05:54.727
- Now Jawal gets shot in his home.
- The agents in charge visited Hudnutt?

05:54.896 --> 05:56.432
He was already in the wind.

05:56.606 --> 05:58.472
Thought you talked
to Reddington about the witness.

05:58.650 --> 06:01.859
I did. He thinks recovering
Jawal's ledger is more important.

06:02.028 --> 06:04.987
- Why?
- It contains the ID of the Nash supplier.

06:05.156 --> 06:06.613
The original supplier...

06:06.783 --> 06:10.117
...the one with thousands of hectares
of opium poppies.

06:10.287 --> 06:13.530
He says finding the supplier is key
to bringing down Garvey. How?

06:13.707 --> 06:16.199
Can he prove Garvey's protecting
the syndicate?

06:16.376 --> 06:19.540
Reddington said that we should
use every conventional method...

06:19.713 --> 06:22.501
- ...at our disposal to find Jawal's killer.
- And Reddington?

06:22.674 --> 06:27.669
I think the methods he has in mind
are a little less conventional.

06:36.187 --> 06:37.769
Good afternoon.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.100
You're good.

06:39.274 --> 06:41.436
This stays outside.

06:41.860 --> 06:44.022
- "This"?
- Raymond.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.778
I'm fine. I'll wait outside.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.706
What do you want?

07:05.800 --> 07:08.759
I'm looking for Coogan Hudnutt.

07:08.929 --> 07:11.421
You must know where he is.

07:11.598 --> 07:16.684
You're the guys who provide security
at his tiki-torch rallies.

07:16.853 --> 07:21.393
Ten thousand goes to the first man
to speak up and tell me where to find him.

07:21.566 --> 07:23.478
- I'll tell you.
- Shut up, Donnie-Wayne.

07:23.652 --> 07:27.020
That's a lot of money. Coogan talks
a good game, but he's not feeding...

07:27.197 --> 07:29.564
- I said, shut up!
- Oh, dear.

07:38.875 --> 07:40.912
Looks like we have a winner.

07:41.419 --> 07:42.626
Where's Coogan?

08:04.275 --> 08:07.643
Rumors are you're the man
who killed Jerry Jawal.

08:07.821 --> 08:11.440
- You must have an item I'm looking for.
- I didn't kill anyone.

08:11.616 --> 08:15.405
And here I was afraid you might
make this easy on yourself.

08:48.153 --> 08:51.817
- I can't believe we did this.
- Understandable you feel that way.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.698
Just remember, he was a terrible man.

08:54.868 --> 08:57.201
What he did to you was unforgivable.

09:00.665 --> 09:02.577
It's gonna be fine.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.618
They have no idea.

09:18.850 --> 09:19.886
You're late.

09:20.643 --> 09:23.135
I know, I'm sorry.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.475
Wait, you're not...?

09:25.648 --> 09:27.935
Are you her?

09:28.109 --> 09:31.568
You reached out through the network,
asked for my help.

09:32.530 --> 09:36.149
- I just didn't realize that you'd be...
- A kid?

09:36.951 --> 09:39.614
- I'm 17.
- Is it true?

09:40.622 --> 09:42.204
Can you help me?

09:42.373 --> 09:44.114
I can.

09:45.251 --> 09:48.835
But you need to be very clear
about what that means.

09:50.757 --> 09:52.965
If I get involved...

09:53.134 --> 09:54.170
...he dies.

09:54.344 --> 09:58.258
No second guessing.
No second chance.

09:58.431 --> 10:01.299
You're asking me to kill him for you.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.885
Is that what you want?

10:07.982 --> 10:09.018
Look.

10:09.943 --> 10:12.777
I know exactly
what you're going through.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.111
Believe me.

10:19.285 --> 10:22.403
Take this. My number's in there.

10:22.914 --> 10:25.907
If you decide you want my help, call.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.495
I can pay you.

10:28.503 --> 10:30.210
I don't want your money.

10:30.839 --> 10:32.296
What I get is a name.

10:32.465 --> 10:35.458
Someone you know
who also needs my services.

10:36.010 --> 10:38.218
You pay it forward.

10:43.935 --> 10:47.849
- I need to get some pastrami.
- What are you gonna do with pastrami?

10:48.022 --> 10:49.729
Eat it. What do you think?

10:49.899 --> 10:51.481
- Is he...?
- Not your man.

10:51.651 --> 10:55.861
On the bright side, he's 3 inches taller.
Who knew skin was so elastic?

10:57.198 --> 11:00.566
I've missed you, Teddy.
It's good to have you back.

11:00.743 --> 11:04.453
- May we join you for lunch?
- Does an opossum have 13 nipples?

11:05.540 --> 11:09.284
I have no idea.
I would think it was an even number.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.918
I'll give Dembe the address for lunch.
Walk with me.

11:22.557 --> 11:24.799
Elizabeth, I have news.

11:24.976 --> 11:27.468
Hudnutt ordered the attack
on the stevedore...

11:27.645 --> 11:29.728
...but had nothing to do
with Jawal's murder.

11:29.898 --> 11:33.733
So we're back to Reddington's theory.
Garvey got to Jawal first.

11:33.902 --> 11:38.237
Maybe. Before we settle on conclusions,
I wanna investigate every option.

11:38.406 --> 11:42.116
Rival drug organizations,
domestic disputes. Jawal was married.

11:42.285 --> 11:45.369
Start with the wife, see what she knows.

11:46.164 --> 11:48.156
Okay. Thank you.

11:49.667 --> 11:53.206
Okay, so I'm sure it's nothing,
but the forensic lab called.

11:53.379 --> 11:57.293
- They have new info on the ambush.
- I'm coming with you.

11:57.467 --> 12:00.460
We're pulling it apart to be extra careful.

12:00.637 --> 12:04.631
But it didn't take too long to find out
why your vehicle lost power.

12:04.807 --> 12:06.844
- What is it?
- I have no idea.

12:07.018 --> 12:11.228
I know what it does. It wirelessly accesses
the power-train control module...

12:11.397 --> 12:13.605
...and ECU software
to allow for remote command.

12:13.775 --> 12:17.485
We need to take this. I need to open it,
see exactly what we're dealing with.

12:17.654 --> 12:18.644
I know that look.

12:18.821 --> 12:22.940
I had the same expression when
my dad let me tune up his '76 Trans Am.

12:24.535 --> 12:26.572
Let me get the paperwork.

12:27.205 --> 12:29.288
How great is this?

12:29.916 --> 12:32.954
- If we can connect this to Garvey...
- Liz...

12:34.295 --> 12:35.752
So...

12:35.922 --> 12:38.460
There's this ring.
I wanna give it to Samar.

12:38.633 --> 12:41.876
But Ressler thinks if I do,
she'll think I'm proposing.

12:42.053 --> 12:46.093
He thinks because we've dated more
than a year, any woman would think that.

12:46.266 --> 12:50.977
But I disagree. And you're,
you know, any woman...

12:51.145 --> 12:52.226
What do you think?

12:53.356 --> 12:56.565
She'll think you've proposed
if she wants to marry you.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.021
If she doesn't,
the thought won't cross her mind.

12:59.195 --> 13:02.984
Or if she doesn't.
You mean, like, now? Or, like, ever?

13:03.157 --> 13:06.616
Now. Ever. She knows
if she wants to marry you, Aram.

13:06.786 --> 13:09.369
Yeah, or if she doesn't. Which is it?

13:10.290 --> 13:14.580
I have no idea. But if you give her
the ring, you'll find out.

13:23.428 --> 13:25.294
Any idea what time it is?

13:25.471 --> 13:26.837
I'm sorry.

13:27.015 --> 13:29.257
You wanna tell me where you've been?

13:30.435 --> 13:33.644
Practice ran late,
so I must have lost track of time.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.726
You didn't think to call?
Let me know you're okay?

13:36.899 --> 13:40.939
Tara, if you want more independence,
show me you're ready for it.

13:41.112 --> 13:42.728
You understand?

13:44.657 --> 13:48.025
Go, get ready for bed.
I'll be up in a minute.

14:00.757 --> 14:03.340
You know I don't like being stern with you.

14:03.509 --> 14:06.843
All I want is for us to get along
and be happy.

14:17.398 --> 14:19.264
That's what I want too.

14:28.242 --> 14:30.484
I know, sweetheart.

14:51.140 --> 14:54.508
FBI. Open the door, please.
Agents Ressler and Navabi.

14:54.685 --> 14:57.052
- Reva, baby, who is it?
- It's the FBI.

14:57.230 --> 15:00.268
I know this is a tough time
for you and your family.

15:00.441 --> 15:02.683
We're here about what happened
to your father.

15:02.860 --> 15:05.694
My father? Nothing happened.
He's here inside.

15:05.863 --> 15:08.105
We need to speak with Mrs. Jawal.

15:08.282 --> 15:09.898
I'm Mrs. Jawal.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.531
Jerry wasn't my father.
He was my husband.

15:19.710 --> 15:22.919
- I'm sorry, how old are you exactly?
- Sixteen.

15:23.089 --> 15:26.503
In our culture, it's not uncommon
for women to marry young.

15:26.676 --> 15:30.590
Her mother and I arranged
the marriage in Maryland. It was legal.

15:30.763 --> 15:33.050
Please tell us you know who did this.

15:33.224 --> 15:37.468
We're doing everything we can,
which is also why we're here...

15:37.645 --> 15:40.979
- ...to question Reva.
- She's a minor. You can't question her...

15:41.149 --> 15:43.641
...without our presence
and our permission.

15:43.818 --> 15:47.232
It's our understanding you were here
when Jerry was murdered.

15:47.405 --> 15:48.896
Is that right?

15:51.701 --> 15:53.442
I was downstairs, doing my homework.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.111
You didn't see or hear
the killer beforehand?

15:56.789 --> 15:59.623
Jerry came home
and said he had a work meeting.

15:59.792 --> 16:03.957
He couldn't stay for dinner.
He went upstairs, and I heard the shots.

16:04.422 --> 16:08.166
So the killer was already in the house
when Jerry arrived?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.587
I don't know. I guess so.

16:10.761 --> 16:14.220
- How long had you been home?
- Maybe an hour.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.474
More, maybe.
I mean, I never went upstairs, so...

16:17.643 --> 16:22.434
- After the shooting, what did you do?
- I screamed and then I called 911.

16:22.899 --> 16:25.562
- From which phone?
- My cell phone.

16:26.360 --> 16:28.898
You can check it, I'm not lying to you.

16:29.071 --> 16:33.315
You didn't hide? You heard shots.
You didn't think you'd be in danger?

16:33.493 --> 16:35.576
- What are you saying?
- And the shooter?

16:35.745 --> 16:38.078
To call 911, you must have seen
the shooter leave.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.988
No...

16:40.166 --> 16:42.954
- Whoever did this...
- I don't feel very well.

16:43.127 --> 16:47.747
The police said there wasn't forced entry.
No broken glass...

16:50.718 --> 16:53.426
Child brides?
That's what this was all about?

16:53.596 --> 16:56.964
We got a warrant for the Jawal house
and looked at her PC.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.224
Her files were wiped,
but with a flashing module...

16:59.393 --> 17:02.056
...I tracked her online activity
and I found this.

17:02.230 --> 17:04.973
It's an underground chat room of sorts.

17:05.148 --> 17:08.983
I can see 83 members,
all girls under 18, all legally married.

17:09.153 --> 17:12.487
- Girls from where?
- Everywhere. All over the world.

17:12.656 --> 17:17.242
According to this, over 700 million women
were married as minors to men.

17:17.411 --> 17:20.950
It happens here too.
Half our states have no age limit.

17:21.123 --> 17:24.867
More than 200,000 American children
were married in the last 15 years.

17:25.044 --> 17:28.037
All that's needed is parental consent
or judicial approval.

17:28.214 --> 17:31.082
Look at this thread.
It includes Orthodox Jews...

17:31.259 --> 17:35.299
...Mormons, Muslims, Christians.
It's like a child-bride support group.

17:35.471 --> 17:38.305
They talk about being forced
to have sex and be wives...

17:38.474 --> 17:41.433
- ...in middle and high school.
- That's not all they talk about.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.184
They also talk about her.

17:43.771 --> 17:47.765
Guardian Angel, a mythic white knight
that appears to set them free.

17:47.942 --> 17:51.561
- Murder their husbands.
- They can't do it through divorce.

17:51.737 --> 17:55.356
Minors need adult consent,
but the adults want them married.

17:55.533 --> 18:00.870
Nine girls in Reva's group have husbands
who were killed or died in accidents.

18:01.038 --> 18:03.951
Keen, see if Reddington knows
anything about this.

18:04.125 --> 18:08.165
Ressler, Navabi, talk to the girls.
Press them for details on this...

18:08.337 --> 18:11.751
- ...Guardian Angel.
- Or we could forget we heard about her.

18:11.924 --> 18:16.089
Is it so wrong what she's doing?
These are adult men marrying children.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.878
It's murder.

18:18.055 --> 18:22.390
That's all our job description allows us
to consider. Go do your jobs.

18:24.312 --> 18:25.644
Samar.

18:26.606 --> 18:27.642
You okay?

18:29.108 --> 18:32.101
- What's this?
- That is how Garvey stole the witness.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.737
Based on the digital signature,
it was made by the same person...

18:35.906 --> 18:39.650
...who created the next-gen surveillance
gear used by the Invisible Hand.

18:39.827 --> 18:43.320
- Makes sense. He worked for Garvey.
- That part makes sense. What doesn't...

18:43.497 --> 18:46.831
...is how he got it into the engine bay
of a car in our motor pool.

18:47.001 --> 18:48.958
The vehicle never left the building...

18:49.128 --> 18:52.166
- ...so either Garvey got in...
- Or knows someone who can.

18:53.591 --> 18:56.459
- You didn't answer my question.
- Am I okay? No.

18:56.636 --> 19:00.129
I spoke with the hospital.
The reason Reva Jawal fainted?

19:00.306 --> 19:02.047
She's pregnant.

19:02.224 --> 19:06.969
It appears we were wrong. Our killer is
neither Garvey nor a white supremacist.

19:07.146 --> 19:11.265
Whoever it is, the girls who hired him
won't tell us. They refer to him or her...

19:11.442 --> 19:14.776
- ...as their Guardian Angel.
- You were half right about Jawal's death.

19:14.945 --> 19:17.403
The ledger, the contents of the safe...

19:17.573 --> 19:21.237
...the whole robbery scheme was staged
to cover the crime.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.824
So to find the ledger, we need
to find the killer who staged it.

19:24.997 --> 19:28.741
The young lady who fainted,
was she taken to a hospital?

19:29.251 --> 19:31.789
Those agents thought you were
hiding something, Reva.

19:31.962 --> 19:33.248
And I have to say...

19:33.422 --> 19:34.503
...so did I.

19:35.758 --> 19:36.965
Ridiculous.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.467
Reva, tell him.

19:40.471 --> 19:41.803
Yes, please.

19:41.972 --> 19:44.214
And if you won't tell him, do tell me.

19:44.392 --> 19:46.930
Excuse me. This is a private room.

19:47.103 --> 19:49.015
- Who are you?
- A friend.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.601
Or a foe. I'm fine with either one.

19:51.774 --> 19:54.141
Let's just say an interested party.

19:54.318 --> 19:55.934
My name is Raymond.

19:57.780 --> 20:02.775
The woman who killed your husband,
am I right in assuming it was a woman?

20:05.287 --> 20:08.325
I understand
why you've been protecting her.

20:08.499 --> 20:09.990
She saved you.

20:10.167 --> 20:13.285
Freed you
from the unimaginable nightmare...

20:13.462 --> 20:17.126
...of a forced marriage
with a man three times your age.

20:17.967 --> 20:20.425
I need her name, Reva.

20:20.594 --> 20:21.801
No.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.093
Your husband was a drug dealer.

20:25.266 --> 20:29.806
He worked with a particularly
vicious organization, helping to...

20:29.979 --> 20:32.312
...smuggle their drugs at the port.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.188
And now...

20:35.025 --> 20:36.766
...you killed their man.

20:37.403 --> 20:39.144
A critical asset.

20:39.321 --> 20:42.655
What do you think they'll do
when they realize it was you?

20:43.159 --> 20:45.025
This gang of killers...

20:45.202 --> 20:48.946
...notorious for showing no mercy
to their enemies?

20:53.294 --> 20:54.785
I'm so sorry.

20:56.130 --> 20:58.838
I don't want to hurt her, Reva.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.874
But she has something I need.

21:01.051 --> 21:05.512
It means nothing to her
and everything to me.

21:08.058 --> 21:09.515
Who is she?

21:09.685 --> 21:11.096
I don't know.

21:12.062 --> 21:15.430
She never said, and we couldn't ask.

21:16.233 --> 21:21.149
All I know is that you pay her back
by finding another girl...

21:21.322 --> 21:23.359
...who also needs her help.

21:23.532 --> 21:26.366
You referred her to another client?

21:32.416 --> 21:33.782
Hey.

21:33.959 --> 21:36.667
I'm starving. When's breakfast?

21:36.837 --> 21:41.832
- I'm going to be late for school.
- You know I love a hot breakfast.

21:43.010 --> 21:45.093
I could write you a note.

21:56.440 --> 22:00.229
- You've decided?
- I can't do this anymore.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.147
Kill him.

22:02.655 --> 22:05.193
Stick to your regular routine.

22:05.366 --> 22:07.449
I'll be in touch when it's done.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.156
Hey.

22:14.333 --> 22:18.168
All right, this is the sketch
of the man I saw take our witness.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.456
- Were you able to identify him?
- No, but I was talking to Samar and...

22:23.509 --> 22:25.296
Did you give her the ring?

22:25.469 --> 22:28.462
And risk finding out that she doesn't
wanna be with me? No.

22:28.639 --> 22:32.178
I'm sure she wants to be with you.
You're a catch.

22:32.351 --> 22:35.765
Yeah, that hasn't been
my experience. I'm more of a...

22:35.938 --> 22:37.725
More of a catch-and-release.

22:37.898 --> 22:42.142
Okay, all right. Point being,
A, she would crush me, and B...

22:42.319 --> 22:45.653
...someone put the remote access device
on the vehicle...

22:45.823 --> 22:47.940
...while it was in the motor pool.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.404
I assume you checked
the logbooks, surveillance?

22:50.578 --> 22:54.242
I did, and I found nothing
inside the building.

22:54.415 --> 22:56.907
Maybe they looped the feed
or avoided the camera.

22:57.084 --> 22:58.996
I don't know and I don't care...

22:59.169 --> 23:03.004
...because outside the building,
I found this guy...

23:03.674 --> 23:07.463
There it is.
...walking towards the post office.

23:07.636 --> 23:10.379
And he and this guy...

23:11.265 --> 23:12.631
...are the same person.

23:13.809 --> 23:17.223
I got nothing off the sketch,
but we now have his photo.

23:17.396 --> 23:19.638
Crazy, right? Eyes like a wolf.

23:20.357 --> 23:24.146
I'm running it through NCIC
to find his connection to Garvey.

23:24.320 --> 23:25.982
Good morning.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.072
You won't find one.

23:29.241 --> 23:30.357
Why not?

23:32.536 --> 23:35.995
Because he has no connection
to Garvey.

23:36.165 --> 23:37.281
How do you know?

23:38.417 --> 23:41.160
Because he works for Reddington.

23:46.550 --> 23:49.714
Reddington called. He has the name
of our Blacklister's next client.

23:49.887 --> 23:51.674
Tara Rayburn, 16 years old.

23:51.847 --> 23:55.591
Woodbridge address, but at this hour,
she's probably in school. Mandell High.

23:55.768 --> 23:57.384
After-school activities include...

23:57.561 --> 24:00.099
...cheerleading and conspiring
to commit murder.

24:00.272 --> 24:03.515
Husband's name is Dale Rayburn.
Owns a used car dealership in D.C.

24:03.692 --> 24:06.059
If Tara's connected to the killer,
he's in danger.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.568
What a shame that would be.

24:07.738 --> 24:10.981
Navabi, get to the girl.
Ressler, secure the husband.

24:12.910 --> 24:14.492
Tell me it wasn't you.

24:15.079 --> 24:19.198
Tell me that after we found a witness
to corroborate my ID on Garvey...

24:19.375 --> 24:21.788
- ...you didn't take him.
- Hold on.

24:21.961 --> 24:25.045
No, I will not let you avoid
a direct question...

24:25.214 --> 24:28.423
...to try and confuse me
or leave me in the dark.

24:28.592 --> 24:30.049
Well, now I'm confused.

24:31.804 --> 24:35.047
Answer me! Give a direct answer
to my simple question.

24:35.224 --> 24:38.137
- Elizabeth.
- Not now, Dembe. Answer me.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.849
Did you or did you not steal Tony Mejia
out of FBI custody?

24:42.022 --> 24:43.229
You know that I did.

24:43.399 --> 24:46.312
Because Garvey has your duffel bag?

24:47.444 --> 24:48.810
He owns you.

24:49.405 --> 24:51.988
You betrayed me, the entire task force...

24:52.157 --> 24:56.777
- ...so that he wouldn't expose the truth.
- I betrayed no one, least of all you.

24:56.954 --> 24:59.617
I told you I was going
to get that duffel bag.

24:59.790 --> 25:03.204
If Garvey is in your custody,
that will be impossible.

25:03.377 --> 25:06.211
If Garvey goes on trial,
that will be impossible.

25:06.672 --> 25:08.504
So until I have that bag...

25:08.674 --> 25:11.291
...I will do what I must
to prevent that from happening.

25:11.468 --> 25:14.677
But I will get it, and then Garvey...

25:14.847 --> 25:16.588
...is going to die.

25:17.307 --> 25:19.344
Is Tony Mejia dead?

25:19.518 --> 25:20.679
Did you kill him?

25:21.687 --> 25:23.428
You know the answer to that.

25:26.942 --> 25:30.811
It's more complicated than you realize.
I need to contact our lawyers...

25:30.988 --> 25:32.900
She's the subject
of a murder investigation.

25:33.073 --> 25:36.737
I'm not asking your permission.
This is a criminal matter.

25:38.662 --> 25:40.369
There are procedures.

25:42.416 --> 25:46.035
- Tara, this is Agent Navabi. She...
- I need this room.

25:46.211 --> 25:47.497
What? Sorry, no.

25:47.671 --> 25:51.506
- As I said, we cannot discuss...
- I am not asking for permission.

25:51.675 --> 25:52.916
Tara?

25:54.136 --> 25:57.629
Step outside or I will have you arrested
for obstruction of justice.

26:04.354 --> 26:05.470
We know, Tara.

26:05.647 --> 26:07.388
We spoke with Reva Jawal.

26:07.941 --> 26:11.355
She murdered her husband with the help
of a woman she heard about online.

26:11.528 --> 26:14.111
As payment,
she had to refer a new client.

26:14.281 --> 26:15.817
I don't know Reva Jawal.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.698
<i>It's not too late.</i>

26:17.868 --> 26:21.612
<i>Have you met with her? Is your husband
in any imminent danger?</i>

26:21.789 --> 26:25.703
Kill me? Come on. You can't
seriously believe Tara wants me dead.

26:25.876 --> 26:28.163
Oh, it's far more serious than that.

26:28.337 --> 26:31.580
We think she may have arranged
for somebody to do the job.

26:31.757 --> 26:34.841
<i>Ridiculous. Tara is happy. We're happy.</i>

26:35.010 --> 26:37.548
<i>Listen to me.
However unhappy you are now...</i>

26:37.721 --> 26:40.179
...it is not worth destroying your life.

26:40.349 --> 26:43.888
If anything happens to him,
you will go to prison.

26:45.479 --> 26:47.061
I don't...

26:47.231 --> 26:49.348
I don't know if I can stop it.

26:50.192 --> 26:52.775
So there is an active plan. Call it off.

26:52.945 --> 26:57.030
- My partner's already talking to Tara.
- Good. Tara can tell her herself.

26:57.199 --> 26:58.656
She wanted to get married.

26:58.826 --> 27:01.660
Her parents approved,
our minister blessed it.

27:01.829 --> 27:04.242
- We have a good life.
- Somehow, I doubt that.

27:06.875 --> 27:09.618
Bill, thought I told you
to get the '06 Audi into service?

27:09.795 --> 27:11.036
<i>Yeah, boss. Already did.</i>

27:11.213 --> 27:13.626
Then why am I looking at it
outside my window?

27:14.758 --> 27:15.999
Get down!

27:32.317 --> 27:34.525
Stop! FBI!

27:34.987 --> 27:38.276
Help. Please, please.
That man, he's trying to kill me.

27:45.789 --> 27:48.281
Hey, buddy. What's going on?

27:57.926 --> 27:59.667
FBI.

28:02.306 --> 28:04.844
She touched your coat. I need it.

28:05.017 --> 28:06.633
Come on, come on.

28:12.191 --> 28:14.683
- We got a problem.
- You gonna tell me what it is...

28:14.860 --> 28:16.271
...or you want me to guess?

28:16.445 --> 28:19.813
Keen. She's searching for Tony Mejia.

28:19.990 --> 28:22.824
For some reason,
she must think he's still alive.

28:22.993 --> 28:27.863
She reached out to law enforcement
agencies asking for help locating him.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.156
That's a problem?

28:29.958 --> 28:30.994
It's not?

28:31.168 --> 28:33.956
It seems like just
the opportunity we need.

28:34.129 --> 28:36.462
The perfect way
to secure our leverage.

28:37.007 --> 28:41.422
I think we should help Agent Keen
find what she's looking for.

28:47.809 --> 28:50.893
Wait, back up.
Reddington attacked the convoy.

28:51.063 --> 28:54.397
He took the witness.
Reddington, not Garvey. Why do that?

28:54.566 --> 28:56.432
Because if Mejia ever testified...

28:56.610 --> 28:59.819
...Garvey would go to prison
and Reddington wouldn't get his bag.

28:59.988 --> 29:03.322
Until he does, it seems
that Mr. Reddington will do anything...

29:03.492 --> 29:07.111
...to protect Garvey, including steal
a material witness from under us.

29:07.287 --> 29:09.404
We figured
Mr. Reddington would move him.

29:09.581 --> 29:11.948
Get him as far from Garvey as possible.

29:12.125 --> 29:15.209
We put a BOLO out
to every private airfield on the East Coast.

29:15.379 --> 29:17.792
- Any luck?
- Maybe. There's a customs officer.

29:17.965 --> 29:21.925
Thinks he saw Mejia board a plane
hours before we issued the BOLO.

29:22.094 --> 29:25.303
Go. If you get confirmation,
we'll get a manifest...

29:25.472 --> 29:27.213
...track where he was going.

29:27.391 --> 29:29.974
- Got an ID on the Blacklister.
- She's 17?

29:30.143 --> 29:33.352
- She's killed at least 10 men.
- Couldn't believe it myself.

29:33.522 --> 29:36.390
She's old enough to research
how to build a bomb.

29:36.566 --> 29:39.604
When she ran, she grabbed a guy,
touched his leather jacket.

29:39.778 --> 29:42.612
Now, I had the lab run it for latent prints.

29:42.781 --> 29:46.195
- And you got a hit?
- We did. An immigration record.

29:46.368 --> 29:49.361
Anna-Gracia Duerte,
born in Brazil 17 years ago.

29:49.538 --> 29:52.906
The State Department says
she entered the country at 13...

29:53.083 --> 29:55.951
- ...with her husband.
- Can that be right? Thirteen?

29:56.128 --> 29:59.166
She married an American businessman,
Robert Corbin.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.753
He was working
for a publishing company in Brazil.

30:02.926 --> 30:06.670
He was 43. And this, an official copy
of their marriage license.

30:06.847 --> 30:09.931
The killer who's freeing child brides
is one herself.

30:10.100 --> 30:14.185
The marriage license has an address
in White Oak. Get there. Now.

30:41.715 --> 30:44.048
I'll take the roof, you take the alley.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.908
Stay back!
Don't come any closer. I'll jump!

31:11.078 --> 31:14.071
- Please don't do that.
- I will. Stay back!

31:15.123 --> 31:19.413
Look, I can only imagine
what you've been through.

31:20.045 --> 31:23.664
One minute you're a child,
the next you're married to a man.

31:23.840 --> 31:27.675
I wasn't just married to him!
He raped me.

31:29.888 --> 31:32.096
He lived near my family's home.

31:33.100 --> 31:36.889
One day he invited me in
to see his apartment and...

31:38.397 --> 31:42.186
I reported it, went to the police.

31:42.359 --> 31:44.976
When my parents found out,
they were angry...

31:45.153 --> 31:46.860
...at me...

31:47.030 --> 31:51.070
...for shaming them,
for causing a scandal.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.743
To make it go away...

31:54.454 --> 31:56.662
...they told a story.

31:57.707 --> 32:00.324
They said we were in love.

32:01.628 --> 32:05.588
They went to Robert, made a deal
like I was something to be traded.

32:06.550 --> 32:08.166
I'm so sorry.

32:09.386 --> 32:12.800
I survived in his hell
for almost three years.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.598
Until one afternoon...

32:16.726 --> 32:19.093
...when I freed myself.

32:21.773 --> 32:23.435
Salvation...

32:25.110 --> 32:27.978
...from a $10 kitchen knife.

32:29.281 --> 32:31.318
I knew then what I would do.

32:31.491 --> 32:33.824
That I would die if necessary...

32:33.994 --> 32:36.611
...trying to save others.

32:39.249 --> 32:42.617
My parents were murdered
when I was 9. My brother and I...

32:42.794 --> 32:45.662
...we were sent to live
with our father's family.

32:46.548 --> 32:49.382
And then, slowly, I began to heal.

32:49.885 --> 32:54.095
This was thanks in large part
to my cousin, Yana, she was 15.

32:54.264 --> 32:57.223
She was like a second mother to me.

32:57.976 --> 32:59.808
Until one night at dinner...

32:59.978 --> 33:02.595
...my uncle announced
she would be married...

33:03.190 --> 33:06.024
...to a man that none of us had ever met.

33:07.110 --> 33:09.523
That night, Yana and I, we sat and cried.

33:09.696 --> 33:11.904
Because the next day, the man came...

33:12.866 --> 33:14.858
...and she was gone.

33:17.412 --> 33:20.200
I didn't have the chance to help her.

33:22.792 --> 33:26.581
Please give me the chance
to help you, Anna-Gracia.

33:27.923 --> 33:30.040
To tell your story.

33:32.385 --> 33:35.173
This isn't where your story should end.

33:40.060 --> 33:41.847
Come, come.

33:50.195 --> 33:53.188
It's a private terminal.
Customs and Border Patrol come...

33:53.365 --> 33:56.654
...to meet any foreign arrivals,
make sure everything checks out.

33:56.826 --> 33:59.409
It was this young man you saw?
You're certain?

33:59.579 --> 34:02.617
Pretty sure. I'd finished clearing
a flight from Buenos Aires...

34:02.791 --> 34:06.660
...and I was driving back to the office,
right past this hangar.

34:06.836 --> 34:08.702
He was in pretty bad shape.

34:17.013 --> 34:19.005
What exactly did you see?

34:19.181 --> 34:21.925
The hangar door was slightly open.

34:22.101 --> 34:25.219
I saw that guy getting out of a car
with a second man.

34:25.397 --> 34:29.107
Now, the second man was wearing
a hat and long coat.

34:29.275 --> 34:31.484
One of those hats that's got the fancy...

34:31.652 --> 34:32.688
- A fedora?
- Yeah.

34:32.862 --> 34:34.978
We have an idea who that might be.

34:35.156 --> 34:37.193
They boarded a Gulfstream G650.

34:37.367 --> 34:39.609
Manifest says they were headed
for the Antilles.

34:44.040 --> 34:45.451
Officer.

34:46.167 --> 34:48.659
- What are you doing?
- We've been set up.

34:51.464 --> 34:54.252
Hello, Agent Keen.
We need you to come with us.

34:56.303 --> 34:58.841
- You work for Garvey?
- He's waiting.

35:00.890 --> 35:01.926
Elizabeth!

35:27.834 --> 35:32.329
You understand what you're asking?
She's guilty of multiple counts of murder.

35:32.505 --> 35:35.043
The first was her husband,
a crime she committed at 16.

35:35.216 --> 35:38.459
Her age doesn't legally justify
what she did.

35:38.637 --> 35:40.720
I'm not excusing it. I'm explaining it.

35:40.889 --> 35:42.255
A 13-year-old rape victim...

35:42.432 --> 35:45.925
...forced by her parents to marry
a man three times her age.

35:46.102 --> 35:50.642
A girl who couldn't drive or consent
to legally have sex with a man over 18.

35:50.815 --> 35:54.775
Her parents consented for her,
to a life of repeated sexual assault.

35:54.944 --> 35:56.025
The marriage was legal.

35:56.196 --> 35:59.314
In most states, if you marry the man
who allegedly raped you...

35:59.491 --> 36:02.575
- ...he can't be prosecuted.
- Imagine that girl's state of mind.

36:02.744 --> 36:06.283
- She could argue duress, insanity.
- Maybe for killing her husband...

36:06.456 --> 36:08.664
- ...but then she kept killing.
- To save others.

36:08.833 --> 36:11.450
She was protecting other girls,
victims like her.

36:11.628 --> 36:15.463
Her lawyers will make her the poster child
to stop forced marriage for minors.

36:15.632 --> 36:19.171
A martyr to the cause of ending
the most widespread sanctioned abuse...

36:19.344 --> 36:23.634
...of women in the world today,
and you will be the man fighting her.

36:24.182 --> 36:25.764
She's just a kid.

36:25.934 --> 36:29.302
She's learned everything
about pain and betrayal.

36:29.771 --> 36:32.309
Let's teach her something about mercy.

36:32.482 --> 36:35.190
Why didn't you pull me off of him before?

36:35.360 --> 36:36.726
I know you could've.

36:37.195 --> 36:40.154
I found it mildly therapeutic.

36:40.323 --> 36:44.158
- I owe you an apology.
- You were watching me in Boston.

36:44.327 --> 36:47.035
I suggested you take refuge here.
You chose not to.

36:47.205 --> 36:49.618
So, yes, I was watching you in Boston.

36:49.791 --> 36:53.660
I don't accept your apology
for taking our witness.

36:53.837 --> 36:56.045
I'm not apologizing for that.

36:56.214 --> 37:01.426
I'm apologizing for telling Garvey that
I would kill him if he ever came after you.

37:01.594 --> 37:03.802
Why would you apologize for that?

37:03.972 --> 37:06.259
Think like a criminal, Lizzy.

37:08.601 --> 37:10.684
Because by threatening him,
you told him...

37:10.854 --> 37:13.642
- ...how important I am to you.
- Yes.

37:13.815 --> 37:17.354
By telling him not to come after me,
you guaranteed he would.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.603
I don't expect you
to accept my apology.

37:20.780 --> 37:22.442
Not until this ends.

37:22.615 --> 37:25.449
But when it does, maybe.

37:26.119 --> 37:29.612
I don't know if this is your fault or not.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.998
But I do know...

37:34.085 --> 37:36.293
...I'm only here because of you.

37:37.797 --> 37:41.131
So thank you.

37:44.179 --> 37:49.049
I understand you have the young girl
who killed Jerry Jawal in custody.

37:49.225 --> 37:52.559
I need you to ask her a question for me.

37:52.937 --> 37:54.599
For us.

37:56.649 --> 37:59.141
- I'm tired.
- We're almost done here.

37:59.819 --> 38:02.903
Anna, the U.S. attorney has made
a decision.

38:03.948 --> 38:07.066
He has the right
to charge you as an adult.

38:07.243 --> 38:10.953
Instead, he has agreed to charge you
as a juvenile offender.

38:12.290 --> 38:13.997
I'm not sure what that means.

38:14.167 --> 38:16.830
It means that you'll have
to plead guilty to everything.

38:17.003 --> 38:19.666
Agree to counseling and rehabilitation.

38:19.839 --> 38:23.332
But it also means you will not
be going to an adult prison.

38:23.802 --> 38:28.092
If you stay out of trouble,
you could be out by the time you're 21.

38:29.057 --> 38:31.014
Twenty-one?

38:31.184 --> 38:34.222
How...? Why would they do this for me?

38:35.021 --> 38:36.808
For the first time in a long time...

38:36.981 --> 38:39.314
...someone will treat you
like what you are.

38:39.484 --> 38:41.020
A child.

38:42.779 --> 38:44.816
Thank you.

38:46.908 --> 38:50.322
Anna, there is something
you could help us with.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.620
Reva Jawal's husband had a safe.

38:53.790 --> 38:56.749
Before you left that night,
you emptied it. Remember?

38:57.836 --> 38:59.748
- Yes.
- There was a book.

38:59.921 --> 39:01.457
A black bank ledger.

39:01.631 --> 39:04.499
We searched your apartment,
but couldn't find it.

39:04.676 --> 39:07.009
Oh, well, I threw it away.

39:07.554 --> 39:09.261
Do you remember where?

39:11.140 --> 39:14.304
Think. It's very important.

39:19.983 --> 39:22.225
Isn't this is delightful?

39:25.029 --> 39:27.612
Some kind of back scratcher, I think.

39:31.119 --> 39:32.985
Here's a bag of noodles.

39:34.038 --> 39:37.622
Remind me why a list
of drug routes is more valuable to us...

39:37.792 --> 39:40.580
...than the key witness
you stole out of FBI custody.

39:40.753 --> 39:43.712
Your witness presented a legal threat.

39:43.882 --> 39:46.966
Unfortunately, Garvey isn't afraid
of legal threats.

39:47.135 --> 39:50.253
Or of you or the police or the cartels.

39:50.430 --> 39:53.047
No, but he is afraid of losing his power.

39:53.224 --> 39:57.468
Which is what I intend to take from him
when we find this damn ledger.

40:02.442 --> 40:03.728
Palm Thai.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.393
What's the occasion?

40:05.570 --> 40:07.857
No occasion. I just had a tough day.

40:08.031 --> 40:11.741
I thought I could wash it down
with a little Pad See Ew.

40:12.327 --> 40:14.660
Do you not want Thai?
I think we have other stuff.

40:14.829 --> 40:18.243
No, no, no. Thai's good.
Thai is... Thai's great.

40:18.416 --> 40:20.658
It's just that...

40:20.835 --> 40:22.371
It's so dumb, really.

40:24.172 --> 40:27.006
You know how my grandmother's
getting rid of a lot of stuff?

40:27.175 --> 40:30.009
Well, she just thought that...

40:31.804 --> 40:32.840
What?

40:33.973 --> 40:35.930
It's... It's...

40:36.851 --> 40:39.468
It's... It's nothing, really. It's...

40:48.279 --> 40:49.315
It's beautiful.

40:50.323 --> 40:54.112
She'll be so happy to hear that.

40:54.285 --> 40:57.449
It's really more from her
than it is from me.

40:57.622 --> 41:00.080
Stop it, I know it was your idea.

41:00.249 --> 41:03.287
I love it. Thank you.

41:05.546 --> 41:07.503
So should we eat?

41:08.341 --> 41:09.798
Eat.

41:09.968 --> 41:13.132
Yes, you know. Food.

41:13.304 --> 41:15.136
I'm starving.

41:16.599 --> 41:17.760
Sure you want Thai?

41:17.934 --> 41:21.598
- Because I can order something else.
- No, no, really. I'm good.

41:22.230 --> 41:24.142
Everything I want is right here.

41:46.421 --> 41:47.957
<i>Yeah?</i>

41:48.131 --> 41:50.043
You tried...

41:50.466 --> 41:51.547
...you failed.

41:51.968 --> 41:53.584
You know what they say.

41:53.761 --> 41:55.502
First you don't succeed...

41:55.680 --> 41:58.844
- You've had your turn, now it's mine.
<i>- Don't get too eager.</i>

41:59.308 --> 42:01.766
I still got what you're looking for.

42:02.729 --> 42:06.097
Now I'm not the only one
who's missing something of value.

42:06.774 --> 42:08.390
What are you talking about?

42:08.985 --> 42:10.192
I'll be in touch.
