- Yes.
- Right.

07:50.571 --> 07:51.319
- Yes.
- Yeah.

07:51.371 --> 07:52.604
- Hosting the reunion.

07:52.639 --> 07:53.655
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

07:53.707 --> 07:54.906
- Uh, what was your reaction
when you heard that?

07:54.941 --> 07:56.158
- Amazing.
- Yeah, fantastic.

07:56.210 --> 07:57.492
- I'm such a fan.
I'm a barb.

07:57.544 --> 07:58.877
I would love that.

07:58.912 --> 08:00.378
- I'm sorry it didn't work out,

08:00.414 --> 08:01.663
but she did wanna
send that video

08:01.715 --> 08:03.048
even the video--
- I appreciate it.

08:03.083 --> 08:04.049
Thank you, nicki.
- Thank you, nicki.

08:04.084 --> 08:04.782
- Thank you.
- I love it.

08:04.801 --> 08:05.783
- Thanks for trying.

08:05.802 --> 08:06.751
- Right.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.503
- Well, mia, from day one,

08:08.555 --> 08:11.339
you came into this group
an open book,

08:11.391 --> 08:14.759
but as any good
chiropractic mogul knows,

08:14.794 --> 08:17.529
everyone's story
has a few cracks.

08:17.564 --> 08:18.463
Take a look.

08:18.499 --> 08:20.298
- Who is mia?
- I don't know that bitch.

08:20.334 --> 08:21.199
- I don't know a mia.
- Okay.

08:21.235 --> 08:22.967
- So, I get my botox
every four weeks.

08:22.986 --> 08:23.768
- Okay.
- I get fillers.

08:23.803 --> 08:25.604
I have my lips.
I have four boobs.

08:25.639 --> 08:26.571
I have my ass done.

08:26.607 --> 08:29.608
I even had my clit worked on.

08:29.643 --> 08:30.975
- You did what, now?

08:30.994 --> 08:32.611
Where did you
meet your spouse?

08:32.646 --> 08:35.363
- Okay, let's do it.

08:35.415 --> 08:37.249
- Was somebody strippin'?
- That's what I'm sayin'.

08:37.284 --> 08:38.650
- You were bartending.
- Mm-hmm.

08:38.685 --> 08:41.419
- Yeah!
- Yes.

08:41.455 --> 08:43.722
Your booty crack has
seen this pole before.

08:43.757 --> 08:44.989
- Oh, my god.

08:45.008 --> 08:47.592
- Shortly after serving drinks,
yes, I did become a stripper,

08:47.628 --> 08:48.426
and they don't have a pole

08:48.462 --> 08:49.661
because they don't want
the stigma,

08:49.680 --> 08:51.396
and the girls
wear long gowns.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.381
- Ooh.
- Long gowns?

08:53.433 --> 08:56.134
- I would tell her, look,
here's x amount of dollars.

08:56.169 --> 08:57.669
Just sit here and talk.
- Aww.

08:57.704 --> 08:59.070
- Ten grand for,
like, two hours.

08:59.106 --> 09:00.138
- Shh.

09:00.173 --> 09:03.942
- That's a lotta money
to pay for someone's time.

09:03.977 --> 09:05.510
- Her name gonna
have to be messy mia.

09:05.546 --> 09:06.578
- Yeah.
[laughing]

09:06.613 --> 09:09.614
- 'cause she find herself
in a whole lotta mess.

09:09.650 --> 09:12.567
- So, mia, how did you like
the experience

09:12.619 --> 09:14.619
of joining this group?

09:14.655 --> 09:16.988
- It's been a wild ride.

09:17.023 --> 09:17.789
Let me tell you.

09:17.824 --> 09:19.791
- Curious about
first impressions.

09:19.826 --> 09:22.794
Candiace, what was
your first impression of mia?

09:22.829 --> 09:24.529
- I loved her at first.

09:24.565 --> 09:26.531
I thought you
were fun at first.

09:26.567 --> 09:28.900
- Gizelle, what about you?

09:28.936 --> 09:31.703
- First impression great
but we had a rocky road

09:31.738 --> 09:32.804
in the beginning.
- Mm-hmm.

09:32.839 --> 09:35.473
- Um, but I did love
how you just owned your sh--.

09:35.509 --> 09:36.474
- Mm-hmm.
- Like, you know, this is me.

09:36.510 --> 09:37.776
- Well...

09:37.811 --> 09:39.043
- She didn't own her sh--?
- No.

09:39.062 --> 09:40.312
There was a lotta lyin'.
- What didn't I own?

09:40.347 --> 09:42.714
- She lied about
her plastic surgery?

09:42.733 --> 09:44.549
- She lied about everything?

09:44.585 --> 09:45.650
- What did I lie about?
- Okay, go ahead.

09:45.686 --> 09:47.385
Why didn't you just say that?
He asked you first.

09:47.404 --> 09:48.270
Why didn't you say--
[laughing]

09:48.322 --> 09:50.438
- because he asked
my first impression.

09:50.490 --> 09:51.523
- Okay.
- I need to know.

09:51.558 --> 09:52.023
What did I lie about?
- What did she lie about?

09:52.058 --> 09:52.857
She wants to know.

09:52.893 --> 09:53.658
- Give me somethin'
I lied about.

09:53.694 --> 09:56.611
- You lied about
your clit surgery.

09:56.663 --> 09:57.579
You said you got
your clit done.

09:57.614 --> 09:59.331
You did not.
- No, I talked to my surgeon.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.699
He said it's all
in the same vicinity.

10:00.734 --> 10:02.400
Those girls need to grow up,
is what he said.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.669
- So, did you get a clitopasty,
or did you get

10:04.705 --> 10:06.705
a vaginal rejuvenation?

10:06.740 --> 10:08.790
- So, I actually got
a whole lot done in--

10:08.842 --> 10:10.842
in that same surgery.
- To your vagina.

10:10.877 --> 10:13.878
- So, I literally had, like,
a full mommy--

10:13.913 --> 10:15.413
- like a mommy makeover or--
- yeah.

10:15.432 --> 10:16.514
- No, it's not.
- No, it's not.

10:16.550 --> 10:17.382
- No, it's not.
No, it's not.

10:17.417 --> 10:18.183
- C-section?
- Okay.

10:18.218 --> 10:18.916
- I don't think that--

10:18.935 --> 10:19.985
- mia,
did you have c-sections?

10:20.020 --> 10:21.886
- I did, three of them.
- So, I-- I was wondering.

10:21.922 --> 10:22.787
How does it--
- if you had c-sections,

10:22.823 --> 10:25.724
why did you get your vagina
tuned up?

10:25.759 --> 10:28.310
- Because I just
wanna get it tuned up.

10:28.362 --> 10:29.594
- What?
- So, you--

10:29.630 --> 10:30.762
- does that make--
- then just say that.

10:30.781 --> 10:31.696
- G and I are very
sexually active.

10:31.732 --> 10:32.564
What's wrong with that?

10:32.599 --> 10:33.698
- Your favorite
position is missionary.

10:33.734 --> 10:35.367
- What's wrong with that?
- Yeah, that's the thing.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.618
- I enjoy missionary.
- Nothing.

10:36.653 --> 10:37.569
I just don't understand how it
beats your puss up to a pulp,

10:37.604 --> 10:38.703
missionary.
- So, just because that's--

10:38.739 --> 10:39.638
our favorite doesn't mean
we don't do other things.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.438
- Well, we don't know what g's--
you know.

10:40.457 --> 10:43.174
- What is wrong with her?
- Andy.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.292
- Um, okay.

10:44.328 --> 10:48.580
Brent from the bronx said,
"mia, were you a stripper?

10:48.615 --> 10:51.466
Were you an escort or what?

10:51.501 --> 10:55.587
Who is paying $10,000
to talk to you in a ballgown?"

10:55.622 --> 10:58.256
- so, that's very common
in high end,

10:58.291 --> 11:01.559
upscale establishments, okay?
So, to meet--

11:01.595 --> 11:03.294
- where was
this organization?

11:03.330 --> 11:05.347
- The steak and lobster joint.
- No, it's a--

11:05.399 --> 11:06.314
it's a strip club
in north carolina and--

11:06.350 --> 11:08.466
- it's in charlotte.
- What's the name of it?

11:08.485 --> 11:10.068
- I'm not sure.
And g-- but g is a--

11:10.103 --> 11:14.138
- what is the name of it?
- G is a-- what's the word?

11:14.157 --> 11:15.690
He's the highest roller.
- A strip club connoisseur.

11:15.742 --> 11:17.359
- He helped build
the vip upstairs.

11:17.411 --> 11:18.326
- Yeah, he's
the highest roller.
- Really?

11:18.362 --> 11:19.444
- One of them, yeah.
- He helped build it.

11:19.479 --> 11:20.862
- Mm-hmm.
- Wow.

11:20.914 --> 11:24.616
And you fell in love.
- No, not at first.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.551
- No.
- No.

11:26.586 --> 11:27.619
My best friend is haitian,

11:27.654 --> 11:30.205
and at the time when they
had their earthquake,

11:30.257 --> 11:33.991
um, he actually helped her get
her organization up and going,

11:34.010 --> 11:35.710
and when he started showing
that he had a heart,

11:35.762 --> 11:38.546
is when I really fell
in love with him.

11:38.598 --> 11:39.831
- Uh-huh.
- I was like, okay,

11:39.850 --> 11:43.001
you're not just this crazy man
walkin' around with no shoes on

11:43.036 --> 11:44.102
in the strip club.

11:44.137 --> 11:47.605
♪♪

11:47.641 --> 11:49.240
- coming up...

11:49.276 --> 11:55.613
I read online that jamal
owes $800,000 in taxes.

11:55.649 --> 11:56.648
- That has nothing
to do with me.

11:56.683 --> 11:57.565
My taxes are paid.
- Okay.

11:57.617 --> 11:59.317
- Gizelle, technically,
they can come back

11:59.352 --> 12:05.790
and get your ass.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.558
- I fell in love when g
actually started showing

12:07.577 --> 12:08.560
that he had a heart.

12:08.595 --> 12:11.446
I was like, okay, you're
not just this crazy man

12:11.498 --> 12:13.164
walkin' around with no shoes on
in the strip club.

12:13.200 --> 12:14.332
You know how g can get, right?
- No shoes?

12:14.367 --> 12:15.450
- He walked around with no
shoes on in the club strip?

12:15.502 --> 12:18.002
- He-he would drop his shoes off
at the shoe shine guy.

12:18.038 --> 12:18.787
- Uh-huh.

12:18.839 --> 12:19.838
- And then go over
to get a cigar.

12:19.873 --> 12:20.955
- There was a shoeshine guy
at the strip club?

12:21.007 --> 12:23.241
- So, the club that I worked in,
we had a makeup artist.

12:23.260 --> 12:23.958
We had a hair stylist.

12:24.010 --> 12:25.743
We had a tanning booth.
- Wow.

12:25.762 --> 12:28.913
- We had a chiropractor that
did come, a massage therapist,

12:28.932 --> 12:32.016
shoeshine guy,
cigar lounge. I mean--

12:32.052 --> 12:33.101
- it's like a spa.
- Very high end.

12:33.136 --> 12:35.220
- It's very upscale.
- A spa with titties and ass.

12:35.255 --> 12:37.555
- Was there a champagne room?
- What's that?

12:37.590 --> 12:38.422
- Where they have sex.
- It's the back room.

12:38.442 --> 12:40.358
- So, they have, like,
champagne areas.

12:40.393 --> 12:41.559
- Okay.
- But we don't have
any closed in areas.

12:41.594 --> 12:42.761
It's not that type
of establishment.

12:42.796 --> 12:43.895
- It's true.
- Did you--

12:43.930 --> 12:45.814
- wendy.
- Did you ever--

12:45.866 --> 12:47.565
and-and tell me if this is
none of my business.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.633
- No, it's fine.

12:48.668 --> 12:51.536
- Did you ever remove
your clothing in the club?

12:51.571 --> 12:53.154
- Absolutely.
- You did?

12:53.206 --> 12:54.372
- I would wear
things like this.

12:54.407 --> 12:55.606
- Yes.

12:55.625 --> 12:57.275
- And then I would just take
off my dress and leave, like,

12:57.294 --> 12:59.878
my little, um,
boy shorts on,

12:59.913 --> 13:01.112
is typically
what I would wear.

13:01.148 --> 13:01.913
- Okay, wow.

13:01.948 --> 13:03.447
- So, isn't that,
like, stripping?

13:03.467 --> 13:04.165
- Pasties or no?
- She said she was a stripper.

13:04.217 --> 13:05.250
- She said she stripped.
- Yeah.

13:05.285 --> 13:08.620
- Okay, but, at first,
you said that you were not

13:08.655 --> 13:10.221
and that you wore the gowns.
- Right.

13:10.257 --> 13:11.222
- So, that's why I was--
- correct.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.340
- So, I do wear the gowns.
Yeah, absolutely.

13:12.392 --> 13:14.292
- But she takes them off.
- But then they come off.

13:14.327 --> 13:15.510
- Yes, they come off
and, you know--

13:15.562 --> 13:16.678
- oh, you didn't
finish the story.

13:16.730 --> 13:17.645
- Right. I didn't get part.
- You didn't tell us that.

13:17.681 --> 13:19.764
- Well, damn, sometimes
I can't get sh-- out

13:19.799 --> 13:21.366
with y'all ladies.

13:21.401 --> 13:24.702
- Um, we got a lotta
response about your mom,

13:24.738 --> 13:28.072
and you received an outpouring
of support from fans.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.607
- When I ask you to do
something, you go,

13:29.642 --> 13:30.608
"let me call your sister,"
and I'm like,

13:30.643 --> 13:33.111
what has she got anything
to do with it?

13:33.146 --> 13:36.648
- I want a better relationship
with my kids.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.449
- What's the relationship
with your mom now,

13:38.485 --> 13:40.752
and how did she receive
being on the show?

13:40.787 --> 13:43.988
- So, um, mom says she's
gonna pray for candiace.

13:44.007 --> 13:45.623
Um, she needs help.
[laughing]

13:45.658 --> 13:48.042
- oh, I don't
need those prayers.

13:48.094 --> 13:49.127
Don't need those.
- You might.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.762
- No, not from that.
- But she did say that, um,

13:50.797 --> 13:51.546
you know, overall,
she's good. The kids--

13:51.598 --> 13:52.163
she actually has
my kids right now.

13:52.182 --> 13:52.630
- Okay, good.
- Good.

13:52.665 --> 13:53.548
- Nice.
- Yeah,

13:53.600 --> 13:55.233
and so we have definitely
come a long way.

13:55.268 --> 13:56.167
- So, that's big.
- Mm-hmm.

13:56.186 --> 13:58.937
- Because it seemed like
during the season,

13:58.972 --> 14:00.338
that was new.
- Mm-hmm. It was new.

14:00.357 --> 14:01.806
- Her taking care of the kids.
- Yeah.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.441
So, she's at the house
right now.

14:03.476 --> 14:04.309
- So, this is now
an ongoing occurrence.

14:04.344 --> 14:05.944
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

14:05.979 --> 14:07.678
- Christine from
new orleans said,

14:07.697 --> 14:09.681
"as a viewer,
it's frustrating to see mia

14:09.716 --> 14:12.483
"appear so self-made
when, in fact,

14:12.518 --> 14:15.587
"her husband handed
her the franchises."

14:15.622 --> 14:18.523
- so, g is an investor on
another account of ours,

14:18.558 --> 14:20.158
but he did not
technically invest

14:20.193 --> 14:22.026
in this particular
entity of mine.

14:22.045 --> 14:24.963
- So-- and they are
chiropractic franchises.

14:24.998 --> 14:27.865
- Yes.
- That you own with g.

14:27.884 --> 14:31.135
- Yes, he is on
two of the companies,

14:31.171 --> 14:32.203
but there's
a total of eight.

14:32.222 --> 14:34.472
- But did he already have
them before he met you?

14:34.507 --> 14:35.473
- No.

14:35.508 --> 14:38.309
He owned mcdonald's restaurants,
and he sold out,

14:38.345 --> 14:41.846
and I had massage envies,
um, and he did invest

14:41.881 --> 14:44.182
in my massage envies
before we got married.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.851
- Okay, so, he did help you
with the massage envy

14:46.886 --> 14:47.819
in the beginning.
- Did help you.

14:47.854 --> 14:49.687
- Yeah, but he didn't
give anything to me.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.055
- Okay.
- I had to qualify on my own.

14:51.074 --> 14:52.690
- Okay, right. Okay.
- Yeah.

14:52.726 --> 14:54.725
- Yolanda from
long beach, new york said,

14:54.744 --> 14:58.329
"mia, never seen anyone
flip flop as much as you.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.331
"one minute, gizelle
has a beautiful heart.

15:00.367 --> 15:03.001
"the next, you're questioning
her character, for example.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.370
"why can't you stick
to your stories?"

15:05.405 --> 15:10.908
- so, I always speak what
I'm feeling in that moment.

15:10.927 --> 15:13.344
If I like you today,
but then somethin' happens,

15:13.380 --> 15:14.345
and I don't
like you tomorrow,

15:14.381 --> 15:15.964
I'm gonna tell you
I don't like you tomorrow.

15:16.016 --> 15:17.849
- Now, that's a lie.
- Okay. All right.

15:17.884 --> 15:21.185
So, sending the text telling
the green-eyed bandits

15:21.221 --> 15:24.389
to schedule an appointment
with your assistant...

15:24.424 --> 15:27.091
- Mia replies, "hi, gizelle.

15:27.110 --> 15:30.328
"unless you want
to discuss business,

15:30.363 --> 15:33.097
"there is nothing I have time
to talk to you about."

15:33.116 --> 15:35.500
- oh.
- But was karen in your ear?

15:35.535 --> 15:36.401
I felt like--
- no.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.619
- I never do that.
I-- I don't do that.

15:37.654 --> 15:39.821
- But when you watched it--
when you watched karen sitting

15:39.873 --> 15:42.707
and talking to her,
did you get the sense

15:42.742 --> 15:44.709
she was coaching her
or guiding her?

15:44.744 --> 15:45.793
- One hundred percent.

15:45.829 --> 15:48.162
- I really don't have
a problem with robyn except

15:48.214 --> 15:50.248
she does gizelle's bidding.
- Mm-hmm.

15:50.283 --> 15:52.550
- And I think
she's up her bush.

15:52.585 --> 15:53.918
Let me be very clear.

15:53.953 --> 15:54.836
Mia is a grown woman.
- Thank you.

15:54.888 --> 15:57.005
- And what I like
about our relationship,

15:57.057 --> 16:00.058
is that mia is gonna do mia.
Karen is gonna do karen.

16:00.093 --> 16:02.560
But our relationship is not
codependent of one another.

16:02.595 --> 16:04.595
- Great.
- We're good.

16:04.630 --> 16:05.463
- Well, uh, gizelle--
- yes.

16:05.482 --> 16:07.432
- This season,
you got a crash course

16:07.467 --> 16:09.267
in driver's ed.
- Yeah.

16:09.302 --> 16:12.570
- All while pumping the brakes
on things with jamal.

16:12.605 --> 16:16.541
But despite your single status,
or was it,

16:16.576 --> 16:18.443
your relationship
continued to be

16:18.478 --> 16:24.315
a topic of reasonably
shady conversation.

16:24.334 --> 16:26.317
- It's not done.
- Oh, I love it!

16:26.336 --> 16:28.319
It's about the addition
on the side.

16:28.338 --> 16:31.589
- Yes.
- There's a long way to go.

16:31.624 --> 16:33.041
- So, you were on
the hater list and-- but--

16:33.093 --> 16:35.460
- oh, hating on this?

16:35.495 --> 16:38.046
[laughing]

16:38.098 --> 16:40.548
- how is the relationship with
you and jamal, right now?

16:40.600 --> 16:41.632
- It's not good.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.101
It's just
too much pandemic.

16:43.136 --> 16:45.603
- Covid of all things?

16:45.638 --> 16:46.571
- Imagine being with a man

16:46.606 --> 16:48.906
that consistently cheats
on you all the time,

16:48.942 --> 16:50.641
but you continuously be
with this person

16:50.677 --> 16:53.778
and think he's worthy enough to
bring him around your daughters.

16:53.813 --> 16:59.484
- We don't see you,
like, in relationships.

16:59.519 --> 17:03.821
Like, it's hard to, like,
look up to you or dad.

17:03.856 --> 17:07.075
- Wow, this is, like,
worse than I thought.

17:07.127 --> 17:14.265
- Have you been
on a date recently?

17:14.300 --> 17:18.586
- Tell me more!

17:18.638 --> 17:22.306
- Yes, honey!

17:22.342 --> 17:23.341
- No!

17:23.376 --> 17:25.209
Sure can't.

17:25.228 --> 17:27.095
[laughing]

17:27.147 --> 17:29.931
- who is the man?
I wanna know who the man is.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.482
Is he here?
Where is the man?

17:31.518 --> 17:33.317
- Um, we're gonna
let andy ask questions.

17:33.353 --> 17:35.353
- Does he exist?
- Where is the man?

17:35.388 --> 17:36.154
[laughing]

17:36.189 --> 17:37.605
- no, that was--
it's very casual.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.273
- Have you seen
that same man again?

17:39.325 --> 17:40.491
- No, that--
that man is gone.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.360
- Wendy has got
to know this person

17:42.395 --> 17:43.961
that you were hanging out with
if he's a commentator.

17:43.997 --> 17:46.114
- I don't know. He's gone.
- I-I actually do.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.498
[gasps]
- you do?

17:47.534 --> 17:48.699
- Uh-huh.
- You know who it was.

17:48.735 --> 17:49.801
- Ooh.

17:49.836 --> 17:50.735
- I know a commentator
who said that he dated her,

17:50.770 --> 17:52.403
but I don't know if that's
the same person.

17:52.439 --> 17:54.405
- Oh.
- He doesn't know her.

17:54.441 --> 17:56.424
- Van?
- Jones, yes.

17:56.459 --> 17:57.592
That's-- yes.
- Van jones is--

17:57.627 --> 17:59.010
that's-that's a fine man.
- She's not his type.

17:59.045 --> 18:01.345
- She's not his type.
- No.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.214
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

18:03.249 --> 18:04.982
He likes women
of integrity.

18:05.018 --> 18:06.250
- Ooh.

18:06.269 --> 18:10.921
- Oh, oh, wow.
- I thought she was
gonna say white girls.

18:10.940 --> 18:11.923
Coming up...

18:11.958 --> 18:14.925
- You brought
your big face

18:14.944 --> 18:15.359
back into my home.
- Oh, god.

18:15.395 --> 18:16.227
- Here we go.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.829
- Bitch, we got
the same size forehead.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.597
- No, bitch.
- We got the same--

18:19.616 --> 18:21.232
we got the same damn forehead.
- No, yours is--

18:21.267 --> 18:27.572
yours is about two and half
inches bigger than mine.

18:27.673 --> 18:30.274
- Back with "the real housewives
of potomac" reunion.

18:30.309 --> 18:32.276
Gizelle, I wanna talk
about the west wing.

18:32.311 --> 18:34.645
Does the house--

18:34.664 --> 18:36.581
is it cohesive?
- Yes.

18:36.616 --> 18:38.249
- Because it looked like
a few different houses.

18:38.284 --> 18:40.318
- It did. It did.
It was a mess.

18:40.353 --> 18:41.752
- Okay.
- At the time,

18:41.788 --> 18:44.005
when all the ladies came,
it did not.

18:44.040 --> 18:45.006
Yes.
- Okay.

18:45.041 --> 18:45.957
- It's coming together.
- It's coming together.

18:45.992 --> 18:46.674
- Have you seen it, robyn?
- I have. Yes.

18:46.709 --> 18:48.493
So, we--
- is it all one motif?

18:48.528 --> 18:50.628
- Well, no.
- Don't lie, robyn.

18:50.663 --> 18:51.796
- No, no, no.
- Yes.

18:51.831 --> 18:55.133
- But the entryway is, like,
bringing it all together.

18:55.168 --> 18:55.800
- Okay.
- With the siding.

18:55.835 --> 18:58.169
- Oh, okay, okay.
- Okay.

18:58.204 --> 18:59.837
The purple walls?

18:59.873 --> 19:01.772
- Not there and it didn't
match my new floor.

19:01.808 --> 19:02.540
Yeah.
- Okay.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.475
I don't know
what it did match.

19:04.510 --> 19:06.344
[laughing]

19:06.379 --> 19:09.313
what was your reaction when you
pulled up to hotel gizelle?

19:09.348 --> 19:13.651
Does it still look like
ronald mcdonald lives there?

19:13.686 --> 19:16.353
- Listen, I don't know
because I have not seen it

19:16.372 --> 19:18.856
since the drive-by.
- Okay.

19:18.892 --> 19:20.525
- The drive-by?
- No, no, I'm sorry,

19:20.560 --> 19:22.426
since the drive-in.
[laughing]

19:22.462 --> 19:25.663
- well, so, it took grace
five times to pass

19:25.698 --> 19:27.865
the learner's permit.
- It did.

19:27.884 --> 19:29.367
[screaming]

19:29.402 --> 19:30.101
you're gonna hit the cameraman.
- Sorry.

19:30.136 --> 19:32.136
- Okay, brake,
brake, brake!

19:32.172 --> 19:34.839
[screaming]
brake, brake, brake!

19:34.874 --> 19:35.840
- Wow.
- Is grace mad with you

19:35.875 --> 19:38.176
for showing the world
that she can't drive?

19:38.211 --> 19:39.143
- Not at all.

19:39.179 --> 19:41.429
- It was quite relatable
and cute, I thought.

19:41.481 --> 19:42.847
- Yeah, it was funny.
- Yeah, I was like, oh, my god.

19:42.882 --> 19:44.432
- Yes.
- I-- it took me a minute, too.

19:44.484 --> 19:45.249
I was with grace.
- And she's--

19:45.285 --> 19:47.151
grace is a good sport.
- She is?

19:47.187 --> 19:47.885
- Yeah.
- Okay, good.

19:47.904 --> 19:49.654
- Um, is jamal
a good driver?

19:49.689 --> 19:50.438
Where does grace
get her skills from?

19:50.490 --> 19:53.024
- No, jamal is
a horrible driver.

19:53.059 --> 19:54.692
- Got it.

19:54.727 --> 19:56.627
- And he's driven
90% of the time.

19:56.663 --> 19:57.862
- Speaking of jamal,

19:57.897 --> 20:01.632
when did the two of you
actually break up?

20:01.668 --> 20:05.236
- I don't know.
Earlier in the year maybe.

20:05.255 --> 20:07.288
- Was it-- okay, so,
we shot the reunion.

20:07.340 --> 20:10.458
- Okay, so, when was that?
November?

20:10.510 --> 20:11.576
- Yeah.
- You were together
at the reunion.

20:11.611 --> 20:12.910
- Okay, yes.
- That was a year ago.

20:12.929 --> 20:15.346
How soon after?
- So, it was in the following--

20:15.381 --> 20:17.548
maybe after the holidays.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.083
- After the holidays.
- Yeah.

20:19.102 --> 20:21.586
- So, like,
a couple months later.

20:21.621 --> 20:22.520
- Yeah, I guess.
- Yeah.

20:22.555 --> 20:24.222
- Maybe January'ish,
late January maybe.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.256
I don't know.
- Okay, okay, so, that's like--

20:25.291 --> 20:26.991
- but, andy, this timeline
doesn't make sense.

20:27.026 --> 20:28.759
So, I'm sorry. Like,
let's just cut the b.S.

20:28.795 --> 20:30.594
You're here saying
January and February,

20:30.613 --> 20:33.064
but didn't jamal do
a video in December

20:33.099 --> 20:36.367
saying that he's not
in a relationship?

20:36.402 --> 20:38.436
We all saw that video.
- He did.

20:38.471 --> 20:40.321
- I mean, no, he didn't
say he wasn't--

20:40.373 --> 20:41.906
he was meaning
he's not married.

20:41.941 --> 20:44.659
- It seemed to me like he
was saying he wasn't

20:44.711 --> 20:45.743
in a relationship with you.
- In a relationship,

20:45.778 --> 20:46.844
that's what he said.
- Ever.

20:46.879 --> 20:47.445
- That's not what--
that's not what it said to me.

20:47.480 --> 20:48.446
- That's not.
- Yeah.

20:48.481 --> 20:51.415
- Okay. You know that
many people watching--

20:51.450 --> 20:53.584
- mm-hmm.
- Saw the last reunion.

20:53.619 --> 20:56.587
- Correct.
- And saw the binder.

20:56.622 --> 21:00.091
So, the-- you know,
it seems logical to assume

21:00.126 --> 21:02.426
that there would be
a connection between

21:02.461 --> 21:03.928
what was in the binder.
- Right.

21:03.963 --> 21:05.296
- That jamal was
with other women.

21:05.315 --> 21:06.230
- Uh-huh.
- And carrying on,

21:06.266 --> 21:08.482
while he was with you
and your breakup.

21:08.518 --> 21:10.268
- Jamal and I have
been through a lot.

21:10.303 --> 21:12.403
- He told his girlfriend
at the time

21:12.438 --> 21:16.474
that it was just reality tv,
and it wasn't true.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.975
- What's your response
to that?

21:17.994 --> 21:20.695
- The binder wasn't
new information.

21:20.747 --> 21:22.780
It wasn't like, oh, my gosh,
I don't know this.

21:22.815 --> 21:24.648
Jamal and I already
talked about that.

21:24.667 --> 21:27.451
- This time was not
a surprise to you.

21:27.486 --> 21:30.204
So, basically,
you gave your consent to be

21:30.256 --> 21:32.290
the other woman
with jamal this time, right?

21:32.325 --> 21:35.259
- No, karen.
We were both seeing--

21:35.295 --> 21:37.094
we were both
figuring it out.

21:37.130 --> 21:39.263
- You were not monogamous.
- So, you guys weren't in a--

21:39.299 --> 21:40.715
- we're figuring it out.
- Okay.

21:40.767 --> 21:44.001
Brittany from alta loma,
california said,

21:44.037 --> 21:46.404
"gizelle, why is it you're
very vocal about

21:46.439 --> 21:49.640
"other people's relationships
but have never opened up

21:49.676 --> 21:51.108
"about your own with jamal?"
- that's not true.

21:51.144 --> 21:52.560
- "we saw you interrogate
everyone at the table

21:52.612 --> 21:55.079
"in williamsburg."
- well...

21:55.114 --> 21:58.182
- "but deflected when askale
asked you about jamal."

21:58.201 --> 22:00.318
- are you in
a relationship?

22:00.353 --> 22:04.188
- I'm not gonna discuss that
in front of trolls.

22:04.207 --> 22:05.456
- That's not true.

22:05.491 --> 22:07.575
I have discussed
any and everything

22:07.627 --> 22:08.926
with everybody here.

22:08.961 --> 22:10.628
- But it's not at the same

22:10.663 --> 22:12.663
level of vulnerability.
- That's not true, candiace.

22:12.698 --> 22:14.165
- Scrutiny.

22:14.200 --> 22:17.701
What she's doing, is
literally not just deflecting,

22:17.720 --> 22:19.136
but she's putting up
a barrier

22:19.172 --> 22:21.505
because if she talks
about she really feels,

22:21.540 --> 22:23.007
she would break down.

22:23.042 --> 22:24.091
So, that is her issue.
- Is that true?

22:24.143 --> 22:25.476
- Wendy, you don't
know me, girl.

22:25.511 --> 22:28.179
- You don't me either,
baby girl.

22:28.214 --> 22:32.716
- I guess the thing that
I'm not getting from you

22:32.735 --> 22:34.551
that I wonder about--
- mm-hmm.

22:34.570 --> 22:37.271
- Is when you let him
back in--

22:37.323 --> 22:38.022
- uh-huh.

22:38.057 --> 22:41.892
- And he cheats
on you again--

22:41.928 --> 22:43.611
- multiple times.

22:43.663 --> 22:44.895
- Multiples times--
- um, which wendy's

22:44.914 --> 22:46.397
obviously excited about.
- Okay.

22:46.416 --> 22:47.665
- Yeah, hilarious.
- No, I'm not, speaking facts.

22:47.700 --> 22:48.833
- Okay.

22:48.868 --> 22:51.736
That had to really hurt.

22:51.771 --> 22:57.508
So, when you found out,
uh, did you cry?

22:57.543 --> 22:58.626
Coming up...

22:58.678 --> 23:02.463
- I know everyone has seen
my husband hurt by my mom.

23:02.515 --> 23:04.415
My family is never
gonna be the same.

23:04.450 --> 23:13.491
Like, I don't know
how to fix it.

23:13.625 --> 23:15.659
- Jamal cheats on
you, again.

23:15.694 --> 23:17.361
- Multiple times.

23:17.380 --> 23:18.746
- Multiples times--
- um, which wendy is

23:18.798 --> 23:20.131
obviously excited about.
- Okay.

23:20.166 --> 23:20.865
- Yeah, hilarious.
- No, I'm not.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.266
I'm just speaking facts.
- Okay.

23:22.301 --> 23:25.436
That had to really hurt.

23:25.471 --> 23:29.106
So, when you found out,
did you cry?

23:29.142 --> 23:30.141
- No.
- No.

23:30.176 --> 23:32.810
- No, I'm not a big crier.
Everyone knows that.

23:32.845 --> 23:34.311
Like, when we got divorced,
was I crying?

23:34.347 --> 23:35.646
Yes.
- Okay.

23:35.681 --> 23:38.048
I guess, for me,
if I was dating someone,

23:38.084 --> 23:40.484
and they cheated on me,
and I let them back in,

23:40.520 --> 23:41.986
there would be a part of me

23:42.021 --> 23:45.439
that would feel like,
"(bleep)."

23:45.491 --> 23:48.325
- like, any hurt that
I had from the first time

23:48.361 --> 23:50.111
might come back.
- Yeah.

23:50.163 --> 23:51.395
- And that pain
didn't come back

23:51.414 --> 23:52.780
when he cheated
on you, again?

23:52.832 --> 23:54.331
- N-n-no.

23:54.367 --> 23:56.467
I feel like, you know,
when you're growing up,

23:56.502 --> 23:58.068
and somebody does
something bad to you,

23:58.087 --> 24:00.838
if they do it again,
doesn't really hurt as much.

24:00.873 --> 24:02.039
- Really?
- One hundred percent.

24:02.074 --> 24:03.240
- I would think it
might hurt more.

24:03.259 --> 24:04.241
- Right.
- That-- no,

24:04.260 --> 24:05.376
uh, that's not me.

24:05.411 --> 24:07.911
- Perhaps if you could get
to the p-place emotionally

24:07.930 --> 24:10.965
to really share
your story, your truth,

24:11.017 --> 24:13.017
which, by the way,
if you shared it right,

24:13.052 --> 24:13.968
you win.

24:14.020 --> 24:15.519
- Why do we not realize
that everyone deals

24:15.555 --> 24:16.804
with things differently?

24:16.856 --> 24:17.888
- Oh, really?
Do they?

24:17.924 --> 24:20.057
- You wanna just interject
in everyone's comments.

24:20.092 --> 24:21.525
Like, can we just all talk?
- What are you talking about?

24:21.561 --> 24:23.394
Everybody talks.
- I was trying to say something,

24:23.429 --> 24:25.429
and you cut me off.
- Can everyone--

24:25.465 --> 24:27.731
- like-like, you can
chill for a second.

24:27.767 --> 24:29.900
All I'm trying to say is,
just because gizelle

24:29.936 --> 24:32.870
is not reacting to things
the way you all want her to,

24:32.905 --> 24:35.772
that doesn't mean that
things don't matter to her.

24:35.791 --> 24:36.991
- We're different.

24:37.043 --> 24:38.993
We deal with things
differently.

24:39.045 --> 24:41.111
So, it's just part
of my personality.

24:41.147 --> 24:42.163
- Okay.

24:42.215 --> 24:44.582
Jen from california said,
"karen, in past seasons,

24:44.617 --> 24:46.783
"you and ray had difficulties
in your marriage."

24:46.802 --> 24:48.952
"knowing how painful it is,
why did you go

24:48.971 --> 24:50.954
"so hard on gizelle
and shame her

24:50.973 --> 24:53.174
"for a man's behavior?"

24:53.226 --> 24:54.525
- I actually was
shaming gizelle

24:54.560 --> 24:56.560
for gizelle's
grown woman choices

24:56.596 --> 24:58.062
because she knows better.

24:58.097 --> 24:59.680
- So, you're saying
she should not have gone

24:59.732 --> 25:01.031
back with jamal.
- I don't believe--

25:01.067 --> 25:02.433
gizelle is
better than that.

25:02.468 --> 25:04.034
I don't believe
in my heart

25:04.070 --> 25:05.069
that you should have
gone back to him.

25:05.104 --> 25:06.803
That is my opinion.
- Thanks for your opinion.

25:06.822 --> 25:08.572
- And I stand by that.
- Great.

25:08.608 --> 25:09.973
- Why do you think
the new gizelle

25:09.992 --> 25:12.276
did choose jamal back?

25:12.311 --> 25:13.878
- I believe
gizelle was lonely.

25:13.913 --> 25:16.413
I believe that she wanted to
go with somethin' familiar

25:16.449 --> 25:18.482
instead of having to
work on a new relationship,

25:18.501 --> 25:20.150
which is hard.
- Okay.

25:20.169 --> 25:22.753
- It had to hurt when
your daughters told you

25:22.788 --> 25:26.040
that they haven't
had a example

25:26.092 --> 25:27.824
of a good relationship.

25:27.843 --> 25:29.426
- Surely, for sure.

25:29.462 --> 25:31.212
You know, I--
- they called you
an emotional vampire.

25:31.264 --> 25:32.880
[laughing]
- yes, which I had to ask them

25:32.932 --> 25:34.131
later, like, really?

25:34.166 --> 25:34.965
And you're right.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.718
My kids have seen me
be very robotic.

25:37.770 --> 25:38.886
- Yes.

25:38.938 --> 25:40.504
- That was my survival.
- Yep, yep.

25:40.523 --> 25:42.773
- I had to be military.
- Okay.

25:42.808 --> 25:44.608
- Or else I wouldn't
have made it.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.560
- It is interesting
to hear you say

25:46.612 --> 25:49.446
that maybe you just built up
a defense mechanism

25:49.482 --> 25:51.348
be-- while you were
raising the girls,

25:51.384 --> 25:52.783
and you stayed with it

25:52.818 --> 25:54.351
as a survival tactic.
- That makes sense.

25:54.370 --> 25:55.519
- That's fair.
- Yeah.

25:55.555 --> 25:57.571
- Which completely
makes sense.

25:57.623 --> 25:58.656
- Right, of course.

25:58.691 --> 26:01.992
- Um, gayle on instagram said,
"wendy and karen,

26:02.027 --> 26:05.195
why does someone's happiness
have to be defined by a man?

26:05.214 --> 26:07.081
Every time you through
shade at gizelle,

26:07.133 --> 26:08.666
the first thing
you say is,

26:08.701 --> 26:11.502
'gizelle isn't happy because
she doesn't have a man.'"

26:11.537 --> 26:13.003
- let's be clear.
- Let's be-- yeah, okay.

26:13.038 --> 26:14.838
- I did not say that.
Um--

26:14.873 --> 26:16.373
- you said, as you
were preparing

26:16.392 --> 26:18.041
for your 25th anniversary

26:18.060 --> 26:19.476
of the institution--
- mm-hmm.

26:19.512 --> 26:21.545
- Twenty-five years, yes,
it's an institution.

26:21.564 --> 26:23.681
Some people ain't even
together for 25 seconds.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.899
Some people can't get
a man out the phone.

26:25.935 --> 26:28.769
- You know, gizelle, cutting
and e-editing is amazing.

26:28.821 --> 26:30.053
You and I have--
- you said it 14 times.

26:30.072 --> 26:30.988
- You did-you did say that.

26:31.023 --> 26:31.722
You did say that.
- I did.

26:31.741 --> 26:33.190
Let me own it.
Let me own it.

26:33.225 --> 26:35.359
I needed therapy myself.
That was therapy for me.

26:35.394 --> 26:36.893
I was like let me get this.
- That was therapeutic.

26:36.912 --> 26:38.495
- Because I took it
for years

26:38.531 --> 26:39.697
where gizelle jabbed
at me at--

26:39.732 --> 26:41.699
- I never jabbed
at your marriage.

26:41.734 --> 26:44.201
- I mean, you clowned karen
for a whole season

26:44.236 --> 26:45.786
about ray's taxes.

26:45.838 --> 26:48.956
- Read everything that's
on the back of my shirt.

26:49.008 --> 26:50.874
- Free karen.

26:50.909 --> 26:52.376
What is that?
- Free uncle ben.

26:52.411 --> 26:54.461
Tax reform.
- Oh...

26:54.513 --> 26:56.714
Gizelle, you tacky
as hell.

26:56.749 --> 27:00.050
- I read online
that jamal owes,

27:00.086 --> 27:03.887
uh, $800,000 in taxes.

27:03.922 --> 27:07.024
- Uh-huh.

27:07.059 --> 27:08.359
He's not my husband.
That has nothing to do with me.

27:08.394 --> 27:09.476
- Okay.
- My taxes are paid.

27:09.528 --> 27:12.062
- Gizelle, technically,
since I do have the experience,

27:12.097 --> 27:13.530
let me lean on in.

27:13.566 --> 27:16.483
So, technically,
you were married in 2008,

27:16.535 --> 27:18.535
which that's the only year

27:18.571 --> 27:20.070
they come back
and get your ass, okay?

27:20.105 --> 27:21.155
- No, they can't.
[laughing]

27:21.207 --> 27:22.439
- and no, seriously,
and I don't want that to happen.

27:22.458 --> 27:23.374
- No, they can't.

27:23.409 --> 27:25.376
- So, technically,
I would say lawyer up.

27:25.411 --> 27:26.443
- You want-- after
seven years, it's a wrap.

27:26.462 --> 27:27.444
- Lawyer up just to make sure.
Just look into it.

27:27.463 --> 27:28.412
- Okay, my taxes are paid.
I bought a house.

27:28.447 --> 27:29.663
- I-I know yours are.
- I bought a house.

27:29.715 --> 27:32.216
- But you were
mrs. Bryant at the time.
- My taxes are paid.

27:32.251 --> 27:33.300
Karen, it's nothing
to do with me.

27:33.336 --> 27:34.951
- Okay, I hope not.
- Okay, nothing to do with me.

27:34.970 --> 27:36.220
My name is not on anything.
- I hope not.

27:36.255 --> 27:37.421
I really--
- my name is on my house.

27:37.456 --> 27:39.006
- It-it-it actually does have
something to do with you.

27:39.058 --> 27:40.007
- I hope not.
- No, it doesn't.

27:40.059 --> 27:42.526
- Because it indirectly
affects your daughters,

27:42.561 --> 27:43.394
possibly.
- Mmm.

27:43.429 --> 27:46.263
- So, my daughters
are fine, as am I,

27:46.298 --> 27:49.433
and that has nothing
to do with me.

27:49.468 --> 27:52.236
- All right.
Well, we'll be back.

27:52.271 --> 27:53.570
Coming up...

27:53.606 --> 27:56.190
- If I knew that
she had the trauma

27:56.242 --> 27:57.274
that she has
with her mother--

27:57.309 --> 27:58.275
- she doesn't have to have
a trauma with mother.

27:58.310 --> 27:58.809
- I would have talked
about something else.

27:58.828 --> 28:00.778
What I will say is,

28:00.813 --> 28:02.696
I was going
light on you,

28:02.748 --> 28:05.015
and what happened was,
you were ungrateful.

28:05.051 --> 28:06.650
If you want to--
- ungrateful?

32:59.161 --> 33:01.194
Anyone else?

33:01.229 --> 33:03.864

you know, his restaurant

33:03.899 --> 33:05.666
was affected
by the pandemic.

33:05.701 --> 33:07.300

- that's true.

33:09.204 --> 33:11.237
- I feel like maybe
his confidence is a little hit.

33:11.256 --> 33:12.639
Like, he is drinking
a little more.

33:12.675 --> 33:13.740
I can see he's put on
a little bit weight.

33:13.759 --> 33:14.925
- No, that's his normal.
That's his normal drinking.

33:14.960 --> 33:15.959
- A little bit of weight.
Like, he's not the same chris

33:16.011 --> 33:19.463
that we met when we first
met you, and so I--

33:19.515 --> 33:21.214
what my take is that he's--
- well, who is the same

33:21.249 --> 33:24.418
after a pandemic?
I think we've all changed.

My mother's name
is not on the deed.

she was talking to robyn

33:42.137 --> 33:42.953

33:42.988 --> 33:46.156
- She likes to be
involved somehow.

33:46.208 --> 33:47.708
So, she likes to insert
herself into places.

33:47.743 --> 33:49.326
- Is she involved?
- No, she is not.

33:49.378 --> 33:51.661
- But you do realize, at
your video shoot, she went--

33:51.714 --> 33:53.780
went around to every
single last one of us.

somebody's mother.

in the black community,

38:10.322 --> 38:11.788
it's referred

38:11.823 --> 38:14.708
I was going light on you,

38:14.760 --> 38:16.660
you were ungrateful.
- Ungrateful?

38:16.695 --> 38:18.261
- And if you want
to-- if you want to--

38:18.297 --> 38:20.363
- hold on, she was ungrateful?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

38:20.399 --> 38:21.498
- You were ungrateful.
- Girl--

38:21.533 --> 38:22.432
- you wanna talk about what's
low budget in my life.

38:22.467 --> 38:23.166
- So, if you say your mom
is low budget,

38:23.185 --> 38:24.184
she's supposed
to thank you?

38:24.219 --> 38:25.185
- What-what am I supposed
when she insults me?

38:25.220 --> 38:26.303
- Well, joning may not
be acceptable anymore.

38:26.338 --> 38:30.056
You saw that episode,
and you thought to yourself,

38:30.108 --> 38:33.610
"wow, I was justified in all
of this," and I did not feel

38:33.645 --> 38:37.680
like your actions towards
her were justifiable.

38:37.699 --> 38:39.616
- What actions?
Let's-let's-let's go back.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.918
- Your things coming
out your mouth.

38:41.953 --> 38:44.821
- It's-- if I wanna
respond verbally, hello.

38:44.856 --> 38:45.689
- Yeah.
- Welcome to the stage.

38:45.724 --> 38:47.407
That's what we do.
We spar verbally.

38:47.459 --> 38:48.691
- How do you think-- can
I ask you a question?

38:48.710 --> 38:51.628
How is that working
for you, honestly?

38:51.663 --> 38:53.163
- How is what working for me?
- Yeah, good question.

38:53.198 --> 38:55.265
- How is the way that
you respond to people

38:55.300 --> 38:56.833
working for you?

38:56.868 --> 38:59.753
You almost were physically
attacked last year.

38:59.805 --> 39:01.421
- So, that's my fault that
I was physically attacked?

39:01.473 --> 39:03.590
- Well, you're
the common dominator.

39:03.642 --> 39:04.540
- False.
- It escalated.

39:04.559 --> 39:06.042
- You are. You are.
- Everyone up here--

39:06.061 --> 39:07.427
everyone up here
has a mouth,

39:07.479 --> 39:09.679
has said nasty,
disrespectful, bottom of the--

39:09.714 --> 39:10.930
bottom of the gutter
things to one another.

39:10.982 --> 39:11.781
- No, we have
not been nasty.

39:11.817 --> 39:12.916
- Gizelle-- gizelle,
can we do this?

39:12.951 --> 39:13.917
Can we do this as an example?
Let's-- let's do this.

39:13.952 --> 39:16.019
- But because I-- because
I am better at it,

39:16.054 --> 39:17.854
I am somehow crucified.

39:17.889 --> 39:18.955
- Oh, I don't think nobody
better than me and gizelle.

39:18.990 --> 39:19.789
- No, you're not.
- No.

39:19.825 --> 39:20.723
- You've had the--

39:20.742 --> 39:22.108
you had the butter knife
thing with ashley.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.493
You had the thing
with monique.

39:23.528 --> 39:24.961
- What was
the butter knife thing?

39:24.996 --> 39:26.963
Get the (bleep) out!
Get the (bleep) out!

39:26.998 --> 39:27.964
- Get the knife out
of your hands, girl!

39:27.999 --> 39:30.784
- You will not discuss
my mother in my home!

39:30.836 --> 39:34.404
You will not discuss
my mother in my home!

39:34.439 --> 39:35.338
- When you waved the butter
knife in my wife.

39:35.374 --> 39:37.207
- I did not throw
a butter knife at you.

39:37.242 --> 39:38.708
- And you-- and you were
acting like

39:38.743 --> 39:39.709
you were gonna flinch.
- That's number two.

39:39.745 --> 39:43.296
Number one is that
you brought your big face

39:43.348 --> 39:44.180
back into my home.
- Oh, god.

39:44.216 --> 39:46.049
- Here we go.
- What about her face?

39:46.084 --> 39:46.916
- Not once, not twice.
- You know what?

39:46.935 --> 39:48.518
Bitch, we got the same
size forehead.

39:48.553 --> 39:50.053
We got the same--
- no, bitch.

39:50.088 --> 39:51.721
No, yours is--
yours is about

39:51.756 --> 39:52.555
two and half inches
bigger than mine.

39:52.590 --> 39:53.923
- We've got the same
damn forehead.

39:53.959 --> 39:57.593
- Ooh.

39:57.612 --> 39:58.728
- We both got
five heads, okay?

39:58.763 --> 39:59.762
- All I'm saying is,

39:59.781 --> 40:03.066
why do I wake up to
tweets saying "fire her"?

40:03.101 --> 40:04.868
- Every week people
say fire her, her.

40:04.903 --> 40:06.069
I've seen it about
everybody up here.

40:06.104 --> 40:06.903
- He asked about
you, candiace.

40:06.938 --> 40:08.104
Answer the question.
- No, no, no.

40:08.140 --> 40:09.305
But what I'm saying is, but
they're-- but they're saying

40:09.341 --> 40:10.540
it in regards to the things
that come out of your mouth.

40:10.575 --> 40:13.159
- It has less to do with me
and more to do with the people

40:13.211 --> 40:15.345
who can't keep up
with what I say.

40:15.380 --> 40:16.329
- But you're
the common denominator.

40:16.381 --> 40:17.480
- Valid.
- If you cannot handle--

40:17.516 --> 40:21.468
- you're the one that's in it!
- If you cannot handle

40:21.503 --> 40:25.054
someone orating and
speaking to you in a way--

40:25.090 --> 40:27.357
- orating.
- But you threw the salad first.

40:27.392 --> 40:29.426
- Right.
- I threw a piece of lettuce.

40:29.461 --> 40:31.060
- It was two, I was there.
I'm scared.

40:31.096 --> 40:31.928
- You threw the butter
knife onto the ground.

40:31.963 --> 40:33.129
- I didn't throw
a butter knife at her.

40:33.165 --> 40:37.016
- If, by chance, after I saw
what I saw, mia clocked you,

40:37.068 --> 40:38.852
I'd have been like--
- mmm.

40:38.904 --> 40:41.604
- Because of the severity of
what you were saying to her.

40:41.639 --> 40:43.940
- What you all are
failing to remember,

40:43.975 --> 40:47.026
is that I never
start any of it.

40:47.078 --> 40:50.046
I am always
responding to someone

40:50.081 --> 40:51.915
who is disrespecting me.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.984
- Okay, but-but, candiace,
moving forward, all I ask,

40:55.020 --> 40:57.620
is that you need to be
able to edit yourself.

40:57.656 --> 41:01.157
You need to be able to pull
back when you've gone too far.

41:01.193 --> 41:02.825
I look at you sometimes,
and you go to a place,

41:02.844 --> 41:03.960
and you're
not even there.

41:03.995 --> 41:05.595
- I'm in there.
I'm there.

41:05.630 --> 41:07.263
- And you're-you're in
there, but it's like

41:07.299 --> 41:09.132
a different person.
- I'm there.

41:09.167 --> 41:11.167
Yeah, it's ra-ta-ta-ta.
- And it's like, do we have to--

41:11.203 --> 41:12.218
- uh-uh.

41:12.270 --> 41:16.222
I don't think mia has met
ra-ta-ta-ta-ta candiace.

41:16.274 --> 41:17.507
- You always
have to go there.

41:17.526 --> 41:20.009
- Ra-ta-ta-ta.
[laughing]

41:20.028 --> 41:23.947
- can I also say that
I have a humongous issue

41:23.982 --> 41:27.817
with mia insinuating that if
her mother were to relapse--

41:27.853 --> 41:28.785
- I have a issue
with that, too.

41:28.820 --> 41:30.453
- That that would be on me.
- Yeah, yeah.

41:30.489 --> 41:32.522
- Her sobriety is
everything to me,

41:32.541 --> 41:34.624
and if my mom relapses
because of that bitch,

41:34.659 --> 41:36.576
she better catch
my ass outside.

41:36.628 --> 41:38.828
I'll tell you that.
- That's not fair.

41:38.863 --> 41:39.929
That's not fair.
- What the facts are,

41:39.965 --> 41:41.831
is that you brought your mother
onto this platform--

41:41.867 --> 41:42.799
- yes, I agree.

41:42.834 --> 41:44.834
- To parade her around
for your storyline.

41:44.869 --> 41:47.253
If she relapses,
that is on you.

41:47.305 --> 41:49.472
- Mmm.
- That's low and foul.

41:49.508 --> 41:51.257
You should be ashamed of
yourself for what you said.

41:51.309 --> 41:53.610
- No, I'm not. My mother
wanted to tell her story.

41:53.645 --> 41:54.844
You wanna know why she wanted
to tell her story?

41:54.879 --> 41:55.812
- Didn't seem like it.

41:55.847 --> 41:56.880
- Because she wants to
inspire many people.

41:56.915 --> 41:57.880
- She didn't seem-- she
seemed very uncomfortable.

41:57.899 --> 41:59.849
- You would never
understand, spoiled brat.

41:59.885 --> 42:01.434
- I wouldn't.
I wish that I could.

42:01.486 --> 42:02.685
- And I don't even know why
I'm talking to her. No, I--

42:02.721 --> 42:03.753
- but you ruined
that opportunity

42:03.788 --> 42:05.221
by being disrespectful.
- No, because she's rude,

42:05.240 --> 42:06.689
and she won't let me talk.
So, (bleep) her.

42:06.725 --> 42:12.529
- Okay, (bleep) me.
(bleep) me.

42:12.564 --> 42:16.232
- Next time, on "the real
housewives of potomac reunion...

42:16.268 --> 42:20.036
- Mia, you have become
a disaster on social media.

42:20.071 --> 42:21.804
- I do have a social
media manager.

42:21.840 --> 42:24.290
- Did she block me,
or did you block me?

42:24.342 --> 42:26.125
- Oh, you're blocked?
- Yeah.

42:26.177 --> 42:28.461
- I apologized to
hampton university,

42:28.513 --> 42:31.297
but I was not wrong about
you were a broken ho

42:31.349 --> 42:32.799
'cause that was
the word on the street.

42:32.851 --> 42:34.551
- Oh.
- That's rooted in misogyny.

42:34.586 --> 42:36.419
What type of woman are you
to say that a woman

42:36.438 --> 42:38.154
has surgery
to keep a man?

42:38.189 --> 42:42.559
You had a whole tummy tuck.
Did you keep jamal?

42:42.594 --> 42:44.143
- Candiace, do
you not understand,

42:44.195 --> 42:45.895
it has to stop.
No one is gonna stand

42:45.931 --> 42:48.798
in the line of fire
of abuse with the tongue.

42:48.833 --> 42:52.101
- Her ass-kicking is
over ----ing due, andy.

42:52.137 --> 42:53.336
- Are you gonna
kick my ass?

42:53.371 --> 42:54.770
- Shut the (bleep) up.

42:54.789 --> 43:00.059
- Okay, I-I'm done.
I'm done.
