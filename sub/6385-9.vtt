<i>Previously on Californication...</i>

00:02.377 --> 00:04.212
<i>My dirty little whore of a nose</i>

00:04.246 --> 00:06.247
is sorry that she let you down.

00:06.265 --> 00:07.582
I wanna fix this, Charlie.

00:09.268 --> 00:10.769
Come on, say it, baby, say it.

00:10.803 --> 00:12.722
I'm getting fucked by Rick Springfield.

00:12.756 --> 00:15.391
Do you want to, um,
go up to my room,

00:15.442 --> 00:16.942
and listen to some records?

00:16.977 --> 00:19.630
- Only if they're mine.
- Church.

00:19.664 --> 00:21.148
You're my student.

00:21.199 --> 00:23.650
Not anymore, I'm not.

00:23.701 --> 00:26.403
I offered myself to you,
and you weren't interested.

00:26.437 --> 00:28.740
If only I could have just
had one little nibble.

00:28.774 --> 00:30.742
Oh!

00:33.329 --> 00:36.131
I'm in love with you, Hank Moody.

00:36.166 --> 00:37.583
Whoa!

00:37.617 --> 00:38.784
Were you sleeping with your T.A.

00:38.802 --> 00:40.669
the whole time
you were sleeping with me?

00:40.720 --> 00:43.807
What? Your dad's fucking my mom!

00:43.841 --> 00:45.975
So what, you're saying
we just pack up and leave L.A.?

00:46.010 --> 00:47.811
The three of us move back
to New York, together?

00:47.845 --> 00:50.815
Yeah. End of the semester. Whatever.

01:03.830 --> 01:05.647
Oh, hey!

01:05.665 --> 01:07.784
Go ahead. You've earned the right.

01:07.818 --> 01:09.819
Can't deny this privilege.

01:09.837 --> 01:12.338
Fire my ass.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.990
Oh, I'm not planning to fire you.

01:14.008 --> 01:15.259
Come again?

01:15.293 --> 01:17.177
Unfortunately, not a
single one of the ladies

01:17.212 --> 01:19.162
that you so egregiously fouled

01:19.180 --> 01:21.683
has agreed to stand up
and press formal charges against you.

01:21.717 --> 01:23.167
And without that, the matter ends here.

01:23.185 --> 01:25.837
You win, Hank Moody. I admit defeat.

01:25.855 --> 01:28.773
Not even my wife will
say a bad word about you.

01:28.808 --> 01:31.026
Or should I say ex-wife?

01:31.061 --> 01:33.679
Just this morning, she
requested I vacate the premises.

01:33.697 --> 01:36.181
- Oh, no, she didn't!
- Oh, yes, she did.

01:36.199 --> 01:38.985
No, you can't... you can't kick
the Dean out of the deanery.

01:39.019 --> 01:39.986
That shit is wrong.

01:40.020 --> 01:41.822
You've gotta get that woman back.

01:41.856 --> 01:43.907
I can help you. What
do you want me to do?

01:43.958 --> 01:45.576
Just ask me.
Ask me... what can I do?

01:45.627 --> 01:46.994
Okay, I've got a question for you.

01:47.028 --> 01:48.413
- You...
- No, not now.

01:48.464 --> 01:51.365
Hold on, I got a call.

01:51.383 --> 01:54.720
Oh. M. Flower. I don't
recognize that number.

01:54.754 --> 01:56.054
- M...
- I don't need to take it.

01:56.089 --> 01:58.223
Mayflower, moron.
Mayflower School for girls.

01:58.258 --> 02:00.209
- That call could be important!
- Oh!

02:06.150 --> 02:08.936
- Hank Moody.
- Stacy Koons.

02:08.987 --> 02:11.238
Yes, I'll, uh... I'll
hold for Principal Green

02:11.273 --> 02:12.940
on a disciplinary matter.

02:12.991 --> 02:16.528
I will also hold for Principal Green.

02:16.562 --> 02:18.447
Oh, this is Principal Green.

02:18.498 --> 02:20.064
I'm handling it here.

02:20.082 --> 02:21.399
I got it. Uh-Huh.

02:21.417 --> 02:23.067
I'm listening. A fight? Oh...

02:23.085 --> 02:25.905
a disagreement, you mean, an argument.

02:25.923 --> 02:28.407
- Oh, that kind of fight.
- What kind of fight?

02:28.425 --> 02:30.593
A physical confrontation. Hmm.

02:30.627 --> 02:32.796
Ah, yeah. That's my girl.

03:18.899 --> 03:22.819
I assure you that expulsion
is not a step we take lightly.

03:22.853 --> 03:25.656
- Expulsion?
- Hey, slow down, Dean Koons!

03:25.690 --> 03:26.824
It's not so much fun here

03:26.858 --> 03:28.075
on the other side of the desk, is it?

03:28.109 --> 03:29.660
Yes, Stacy, let's just wait and see

03:29.694 --> 03:30.945
what Principal Green has to say.

03:30.979 --> 03:32.196
She's such a kiss-ass!

03:32.247 --> 03:34.699
After all, she didn't
say that both girls...

03:34.750 --> 03:36.501
Oh, no, they're both being expelled.

03:36.536 --> 03:39.337
We have a zero-tolerance policy

03:39.372 --> 03:41.824
on violence here at
the Mayflower School.

03:41.842 --> 03:44.159
We've just never had to apply it before,

03:44.177 --> 03:47.013
since most of our young
ladies have been taught

03:47.047 --> 03:48.665
not to resort to physical violence

03:48.683 --> 03:50.968
as a means of expression.

03:51.002 --> 03:55.305
Mm-hmm. So... hey, let's look
at the bright side here.

03:55.315 --> 03:58.142
We're making history.
Big ups for women's rights.

03:58.176 --> 03:59.644
You know what? This is wrong.

03:59.728 --> 04:02.530
There is just no way that
Becca would hit anyone.

04:02.565 --> 04:04.366
Right. Not without being provoked.

04:04.401 --> 04:06.402
We're not a family that
takes shit lying down.

04:06.453 --> 04:07.653
There, see, he just admitted
it was Becca's fault.

04:07.687 --> 04:08.821
- I did not.
- Did too.

04:08.855 --> 04:10.406
- I didn't. I didn't.
- Did too. Did.

04:10.457 --> 04:12.542
Principal Green,
I'm sure that there's no need

04:12.577 --> 04:13.860
to take drastic action

04:14.045 --> 04:15.912
that might impact the
girls' academic future.

04:15.963 --> 04:17.914
Chelsea was clearly upset yesterday

04:17.964 --> 04:19.466
because her father was moving out.

04:19.500 --> 04:21.752
I tried to explain to her
that it wasn't Hank's fault.

04:21.803 --> 04:24.055
What? What's she talking about?

04:24.056 --> 04:25.673
I don't know. She has that accent...

04:25.707 --> 04:28.927
- I'm so sorry.
- Hank's fault?

04:28.978 --> 04:31.063
You didn't tell her.

04:32.381 --> 04:34.651
Tell me what?

04:34.685 --> 04:37.070
Becca's father and I had a
slight, well, indiscretion

04:37.104 --> 04:39.489
that may have contributed...
indirectly, though...

04:39.523 --> 04:40.823
to the girls' little kafuffle.

04:40.857 --> 04:43.611
She's kidding, right? You
have got to be kidding me.

04:43.662 --> 04:45.195
He fucks my wife,

04:45.229 --> 04:47.081
I somehow ended up sleeping
at the faculty club.

04:47.115 --> 04:49.366
Oh, Stacy, you're making
this worse than it has to be.

04:49.400 --> 04:50.702
- I don't think so.
- Karen...

04:50.736 --> 04:53.571
You! You... you say one word to me,

04:53.589 --> 04:57.175
and I will show you where
Becca learned to throw down.

05:01.632 --> 05:04.133
Hey, there, Minnie Mouse.

05:04.184 --> 05:07.638
Whoa! Shouldn't you be
dressed and ready for action?

05:07.689 --> 05:09.890
I mean waxin'. Action waxin'.

05:09.924 --> 05:11.424
Ha ha. You get it? It rhymes.

05:11.442 --> 05:13.060
Action waxin'.

05:13.094 --> 05:15.730
Bite me.

05:15.764 --> 05:19.067
Still no call from Rick Springfield.

05:19.101 --> 05:21.954
You don't have to sound
so chipper about it.

05:21.988 --> 05:25.107
The man's been in Tahoe
for the past three days.

05:25.125 --> 05:27.326
I know, I know.

05:27.377 --> 05:29.445
That was a huge show for him.

05:29.463 --> 05:31.948
He's probably just
decompressing right now.

05:31.966 --> 05:33.282
Sure, sure.

05:33.300 --> 05:34.951
Or maybe...

05:34.969 --> 05:37.922
he's trying to tell you something.

05:37.956 --> 05:41.509
You know, this could be
a blessing in disguise, really.

05:41.560 --> 05:43.293
He'll call.

05:43.311 --> 05:45.430
Maybe.

05:45.464 --> 05:48.316
Or... maybe not.

05:48.351 --> 05:50.301
You know, maybe Rick Springfield

05:50.319 --> 05:52.438
not calling you for three days

05:52.472 --> 05:56.109
is his way of saying that
he doesn't see the real you,

05:56.143 --> 05:59.145
that he doesn't, uh,
value your essential

05:59.163 --> 06:00.581
woman-ness and so forth.

06:00.615 --> 06:03.784
Oh, my God, would you please
mind your own business, Runkle?

06:03.818 --> 06:05.652
Hey, Rick Springfield is my business.

06:05.704 --> 06:07.121
He's my client, for Christ sakes.

06:07.155 --> 06:08.707
You know, I'll tell
you something, Marce.

06:08.758 --> 06:11.676
I have seen some things,
okay, up close and personal,

06:11.711 --> 06:14.596
some strangely fucked-up shit, huh?

06:14.630 --> 06:18.000
That guy... he's not the
biggest friend to women.

06:18.018 --> 06:19.301
Oh...

06:19.335 --> 06:22.004
and you're frigging
Bella Abzug over here.

06:22.022 --> 06:23.890
Far from it.

06:23.941 --> 06:27.844
No, I totally get it...
I'm dating my dream crush...

06:27.862 --> 06:29.813
hitting my peak sexually,

06:29.847 --> 06:33.184
this close to selling
this frigid box of a house,

06:33.202 --> 06:35.019
and moving on with my life,

06:35.037 --> 06:37.038
and you just don't want
me to be happy, Charlie.

06:37.072 --> 06:40.209
Of course I want you to be happy, Marcy.

06:40.243 --> 06:43.045
God, I mean, look,
we're talking here, okay?

06:43.079 --> 06:45.664
I miss this. I miss us.

06:45.698 --> 06:47.383
Do you know how long it's been

06:47.418 --> 06:49.502
since I've heard you say
those three little words?

06:49.536 --> 06:51.221
Eat my clam?

06:51.255 --> 06:54.558
Eat my clam...
No, no, not eat my clam.

06:54.593 --> 06:56.343
I love you.

06:56.377 --> 06:58.229
I don't mean to get a
bee in my bonnet, babe.

06:58.263 --> 07:00.214
I just... I don't wanna
see you waste your life

07:00.232 --> 07:02.934
waiting for a phone call
that might never come.

07:02.985 --> 07:05.570
Oh, it's coming, fool.

07:05.605 --> 07:07.572
And by the way, my gay uncle called.

07:07.607 --> 07:10.059
He wants his expressions back.

07:16.834 --> 07:19.402
Guess it's homeschooling after all.

07:19.420 --> 07:22.289
Well, you better hope that
he remembers his algebra,

07:22.340 --> 07:24.407
because you definitely won't be going

07:24.425 --> 07:26.211
to a New York private school after this.

07:26.245 --> 07:28.463
Well, obviously, she was provoked.

07:28.514 --> 07:31.049
Yes. She called you a home wrecker...

07:31.083 --> 07:32.267
which you are.

07:32.301 --> 07:33.602
Yet somehow that didn't stop me

07:33.637 --> 07:35.304
from shoving her into
the vending machine.

07:35.355 --> 07:37.589
Then the hitting began.

07:37.607 --> 07:39.975
Satisfied?

07:41.696 --> 07:44.981
Hank, I asked you to do one thing.

07:45.032 --> 07:47.869
Look after Becca.
How hard is that?

07:47.903 --> 07:49.603
Hard. Real hard.

07:49.621 --> 07:51.105
I understand that now.

07:51.123 --> 07:53.074
Well, it couldn't have
been that hard, could it?

07:53.108 --> 07:54.441
What's that supposed to mean?

07:54.459 --> 07:56.795
You know what that means.

07:56.830 --> 07:58.280
You're mad about Felicia?

07:58.298 --> 07:59.965
No. I would not give
you the satisfaction

07:59.999 --> 08:01.500
of being mad about Felicia.

08:01.551 --> 08:03.469
I don't know how
satisfying that would be.

08:03.504 --> 08:05.805
You know what? While I'm
working my ass off in New York,

08:05.840 --> 08:07.640
you start some kind of relationship

08:07.675 --> 08:10.426
with the most annoying
woman on the planet,

08:10.460 --> 08:13.647
who also happens to be the
mother of Becca's best friend

08:13.682 --> 08:15.649
and your boss! What is...

08:15.684 --> 08:17.735
It's not a relationship,
Karen, far from it.

08:17.769 --> 08:18.987
You know that.

08:19.021 --> 08:20.655
She was just looking
to sleep with someone...

08:20.690 --> 08:22.274
anyone... get her groove back,

08:22.308 --> 08:24.609
get back at the Dean,
and I... I didn't want to.

08:24.643 --> 08:26.662
I thought it was a bad idea.
You know, it seemed wrong to me.

08:26.697 --> 08:29.165
We don't like to get involved
in other people's marital woes,

08:29.199 --> 08:30.366
'cause we've been there.

08:30.417 --> 08:31.701
That's some sad, messed-up shit,

08:31.752 --> 08:33.152
and I wanted to keep us out of it.

08:33.169 --> 08:35.621
Oh, you did a really good job
of not getting involved, Hank.

08:35.655 --> 08:37.591
Well, I did, at first. I refused.

08:37.625 --> 08:40.210
But then she was gonna call in
her chip with this other dude,

08:40.260 --> 08:42.330
this Mr. Zipless fuck,
a real cheeseball...

08:42.347 --> 08:44.164
You know what? Out.

08:44.183 --> 08:45.767
What? What?

08:45.801 --> 08:47.886
I don't want to hear
about Felicia and her...

08:47.937 --> 08:49.304
- ... midlife crisis, okay?
- Okay.

08:49.338 --> 08:51.891
Do you have any idea how
fucking infuriating you are?

08:51.942 --> 08:53.776
Yes. Yes, I do.

08:53.810 --> 08:55.361
I'm just trying to fill you in

08:55.395 --> 08:57.062
on what happened while you were away.

08:57.113 --> 09:00.951
Leave now, okay?
I need... I need peace, Hank.

09:00.985 --> 09:02.652
You must have something to do,

09:02.703 --> 09:04.654
I... I mean some... papers to grade,

09:04.688 --> 09:06.190
some fucking marijuana to smoke,

09:06.208 --> 09:09.160
hey, some students to fuck.

09:09.194 --> 09:13.248
What? So... so you'd be
totally fine if I, uh...

09:14.384 --> 09:16.368
Uhh!

09:37.109 --> 09:39.778
Oh. Pipes of a fucking angel.

09:39.829 --> 09:42.113
You know, I gotta take this down

09:42.164 --> 09:43.498
and play it for the
girls at the orphanage.

09:43.532 --> 09:44.867
Right on.

09:44.901 --> 09:46.902
Hey, I'm doing a
children's charity concert

09:46.920 --> 09:48.371
at, uh, the Grove Thursday night.

09:48.405 --> 09:51.507
Yeah, half the proceeds go
to, uh, juvenile diabetes.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.577
What?

09:54.595 --> 09:56.413
Um, I'm speechless.

09:56.431 --> 09:58.915
Girls at the orphanage?
Juvenile diabetes?

09:58.933 --> 10:00.584
Who are you two, and what have you done

10:00.602 --> 10:02.253
with the nymphomaniacal sociopaths

10:02.271 --> 10:03.921
I've grown to love and loathe?

10:03.939 --> 10:05.923
Sorry to burst your bubble, Runkle.

10:05.941 --> 10:09.061
- I'm a complicated beast.
- Me too.

10:09.095 --> 10:10.595
Plus, you know, charity
events are like ground zero

10:10.613 --> 10:11.730
for single pussy.

10:11.764 --> 10:13.115
And he's back.

10:13.149 --> 10:14.767
Hey, you should have seen me in Tahoe.

10:14.785 --> 10:16.786
Two nights, six chicks... no rubbers.

10:16.821 --> 10:19.789
Bravo, Rick. Bravo.

10:19.824 --> 10:22.609
Safety first, I always say, of course.

10:22.627 --> 10:24.078
But then again,

10:24.112 --> 10:25.913
I'm not the one who's currently having

10:25.947 --> 10:28.582
intimate relations with my wife.

10:28.667 --> 10:31.136
Oh, can it, Runkle. Life's messy.

10:31.170 --> 10:32.787
You better clean up your game, gonzo...

10:32.805 --> 10:34.673
the womanizing, the boozing.

10:34.724 --> 10:37.292
If you won't do it for Marcy,
at least do it for your career.

10:37.310 --> 10:40.463
We have landed you the
comeback vehicle of a lifetime.

10:40.481 --> 10:42.598
Please don't fuck it up.

10:42.632 --> 10:44.233
Hey, please don't use
the "C" word, all right?

10:44.268 --> 10:46.136
I'm not coming back from anything.

10:46.154 --> 10:48.856
That reminds me... I need some blow.

10:50.775 --> 10:52.493
Sorry?

10:52.577 --> 10:54.329
Dude, you heard me.

10:54.363 --> 10:55.997
Some blow, some yay, some white girl,

10:56.032 --> 10:57.315
some powder, some cake.

10:57.333 --> 10:58.783
I start filming tomorrow.

10:58.817 --> 11:00.835
It's my last chance to
get fucked out of my mind.

11:00.870 --> 11:02.788
All due respect, '80s rock star,

11:02.822 --> 11:05.541
I think you'd have a better
line on cocaine than I would.

11:05.592 --> 11:06.509
So?

11:06.593 --> 11:07.826
So why are you asking me

11:07.844 --> 11:10.213
to procure you drugs
like I'm your assistant?

11:10.264 --> 11:13.166
Gee, uh, let me see.
Because I fucking can.

11:13.184 --> 11:16.002
I don't think I like your tone, bud,

11:16.020 --> 11:18.056
not one little bit.

11:18.107 --> 11:21.675
9:00 p.m., my trailer on set.

11:21.685 --> 11:24.178
Okay?

11:27.617 --> 11:30.685
Aw, Christ, Runkle!

11:30.703 --> 11:31.853
Sack up!

11:31.871 --> 11:33.540
If a client asks you

11:33.574 --> 11:36.326
to dress up like a french
maid and rim his shit-hole,

11:36.360 --> 11:38.912
you comply, with bells on, huh?

11:38.963 --> 11:41.549
I would hook him up myself,
but my guy's in Thailand...

11:41.583 --> 11:45.002
Just some sex tourism,
something like that, anyway.

11:45.036 --> 11:46.637
So this one's on you.

11:46.671 --> 11:47.756
Oh. Almost forgot.

11:47.807 --> 11:49.391
Here.

11:49.425 --> 11:51.510
Annual bonus.

11:51.544 --> 11:54.096
Don't spend it all
in one place, ladyboy.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.155
This does seem mighty small.

12:02.189 --> 12:03.857
I think I got a bigger bonus check

12:03.891 --> 12:05.492
when I worked at Blockbuster in '91.

12:05.527 --> 12:07.444
Wait, wait. Be kind, rewind.

12:07.529 --> 12:08.912
Hank Moody worked at Blockbuster?

12:08.947 --> 12:11.566
Yeah. Yeah, I had the khakis,
the tucked-in polo.

12:11.584 --> 12:13.067
The whole thing.

12:13.085 --> 12:15.036
I used to splice porn
into the Disney films.

12:15.070 --> 12:17.071
Of course you did.

12:17.089 --> 12:18.674
But back to you.

12:18.708 --> 12:21.427
How does this all make you feel...

12:21.461 --> 12:23.963
... emotionally?

12:24.014 --> 12:25.214
Wow.

12:25.248 --> 12:28.185
Well...

12:28.219 --> 12:30.086
... between my sad little bonus check

12:30.104 --> 12:32.222
and my new position
as Rick Springfield's

12:32.256 --> 12:33.756
drug dealer/pimp,

12:33.774 --> 12:38.062
I would have to say
I feel like shit emotionally.

12:38.096 --> 12:41.098
Enough! I've grown tired of
your jibber-jabber, Runkle.

12:41.116 --> 12:43.068
My turn. Let's switch it up!

12:48.408 --> 12:49.459
Oh...

12:49.493 --> 12:51.828
Becca got expelled.

12:51.879 --> 12:54.497
She went all Leon Spinks
on her BFF (Best Friends Forever).

12:54.582 --> 12:55.832
Really?

12:55.883 --> 12:58.969
Is it creepy that I find
that mildly arousing?

12:59.004 --> 13:02.007
- Yes.
- Continue!

13:02.017 --> 13:04.058
Karen is livid, as well she should be.

13:04.092 --> 13:06.294
I honestly don't know how
it all got so out of hand.

13:06.312 --> 13:08.180
Chelsea and Becca were thick as thieves,

13:08.231 --> 13:09.731
once upon a time, like you and me.

13:09.765 --> 13:11.850
The Dean's been kicked
out of the deanery.

13:11.901 --> 13:13.469
Felicia did that, and that ain't right.

13:13.487 --> 13:14.637
And I should be happy.

13:14.655 --> 13:16.138
I know I should,

13:16.156 --> 13:18.991
because we're all packing up
and moving to New York soon.

13:23.314 --> 13:24.948
Are you weeping?

13:27.118 --> 13:29.153
I need cocaine!

13:31.990 --> 13:34.042
- And this concerns me how?
- I don't know!

13:34.093 --> 13:35.126
Mm.

13:35.160 --> 13:37.496
I just... I might get fired!

13:37.514 --> 13:39.515
Collini doesn't give a shit about me.

13:39.549 --> 13:41.333
Marcy... Marcy, she's
a fucking stranger.

13:41.351 --> 13:44.721
No one takes care of me!

13:44.772 --> 13:46.306
And now you, you're leaving me too.

13:46.390 --> 13:48.608
You're moving back to New York.

13:53.649 --> 13:56.117
Come here!

13:59.072 --> 14:00.956
Big boy.

14:00.990 --> 14:02.658
Uh, sorry.

14:02.692 --> 14:06.629
Am I interrupting something,
Professor Moody?

14:06.664 --> 14:08.915
Nah. Just a complete
psychological breakdown.

14:08.966 --> 14:10.416
I'm just picking up my essay.

14:10.467 --> 14:12.034
Jill said she graded them.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.972
- Rock on.
- Oh.

14:17.342 --> 14:20.043
Oh, and you should
hit up Dave Edelstein.

14:20.061 --> 14:21.712
Kind of a douche,

14:21.730 --> 14:25.016
but his coke is the fucking truth.

14:28.887 --> 14:31.557
What? It's a great study aid.

14:31.742 --> 14:34.160
Plus, it suppresses my gag reflex.

14:34.194 --> 14:37.229
Good for... you know.

14:37.247 --> 14:41.835
Noted. And dismissed.

14:41.869 --> 14:44.454
Shotgun?

14:49.378 --> 14:52.246
They're not gonna hear that.

14:52.264 --> 14:54.406
An unreliable drug
dealer, the fucking gall.

14:54.416 --> 14:56.135
All right, well. We tried, right?

14:56.186 --> 14:57.586
- I gave it a shot.
- That's you trying?

14:57.604 --> 14:58.754
What?

14:58.772 --> 15:00.757
No wonder my last book didn't sell.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.475
- Aeeeii!
- Cheese it, the cops.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.397
Oh, unlocked...

15:07.431 --> 15:10.568
Go, go!

15:16.793 --> 15:19.127
Come on!

15:26.119 --> 15:27.220
Ha ha!

15:27.254 --> 15:29.472
Bleah!

15:29.506 --> 15:32.259
Oh, a fleshlight... stealthy, secure.

15:32.293 --> 15:34.311
I hate to say it,
but it's highly likely.

15:34.346 --> 15:38.098
Maybe in the labia. Vas definitely.

15:38.132 --> 15:40.402
- I would, uh, check it out.
- Oh, shit!

15:40.436 --> 15:43.738
Looks a little like you. Check it.

15:43.773 --> 15:45.490
Go deep. Dig in.

15:45.524 --> 15:47.476
Get in there.

15:49.446 --> 15:52.314
Oh, Charlie.

15:52.332 --> 15:54.750
Ah! Goddamn it. It's sticky inside.

15:54.785 --> 15:56.286
What are you laughing at?

15:56.320 --> 15:58.505
'Cause I know where it is, numb nuts.

15:58.539 --> 15:59.756
Go.

15:59.791 --> 16:01.991
Fucking hell.

16:02.009 --> 16:04.345
Oh, you have got to be kidding me.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.331
Go ahead!
I had a few when I was a kid.

16:07.349 --> 16:09.801
They're... they're like
sweethearts with scales.

16:11.337 --> 16:13.272
- Just do it.
- What is dis?

16:13.306 --> 16:17.443
Okay. You're not such a
bad boy, really, are you?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.612
No...

16:19.647 --> 16:21.531
You're a good little boy.

16:21.565 --> 16:23.867
That's a good boy.

16:26.822 --> 16:28.489
- Ow! Fuck! Ah! God!
- Runkle, shit!

16:28.523 --> 16:29.707
What the fuck, Runkle?

16:29.741 --> 16:31.292
That fucking thing fed upon me!

16:31.326 --> 16:33.962
That fucking goddamn
monster fucking ate my flesh.

16:33.996 --> 16:36.131
Oh, shit. Jesus Christ,
what if it's poisonous?

16:36.165 --> 16:38.216
I think I... I feel
my heart slowing down.

16:38.251 --> 16:40.585
Oh, my God, I think
something weird is happening.

16:40.636 --> 16:41.804
Is there?

16:41.839 --> 16:43.539
You're becoming an even bigger pussy!

16:43.557 --> 16:45.141
It's a garter snake. It's
an overgrown earthworm.

16:45.175 --> 16:46.142
You're fine.

16:46.176 --> 16:47.343
Excuse me.

16:47.377 --> 16:49.146
IDs now.

16:49.180 --> 16:51.315
Oh, well, actually, we're
just... we're just visiting.

16:51.349 --> 16:54.234
- Yeah? Who you visiting?
- His, uh...  His, uh, cousin.

16:54.269 --> 16:55.652
- Yeah.
- Lover. His nephew.

16:55.687 --> 16:57.388
David Edelstein.

16:57.406 --> 16:59.724
David Edelstein.

16:59.742 --> 17:02.076
Runkle. Runkle.

17:05.866 --> 17:07.398
Run, Runkle!

17:07.416 --> 17:09.401
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.904
Jeez. Okay. Sorry. Sorry.

17:13.875 --> 17:15.541
Oh, sorry, sorry.

17:21.884 --> 17:22.849
Oh!

17:22.885 --> 17:24.050
That's my left ball!

17:24.085 --> 17:25.353
That's my right ball.

17:25.387 --> 17:27.355
No! Not the glans!

17:27.388 --> 17:30.392
Runkle, save yourself. Run!

17:30.426 --> 17:32.728
Easy on the cuffs there, bad lieutenant.

17:32.762 --> 17:35.113
- You're making a big mistake.
- Save it for the cops.

17:35.148 --> 17:36.900
You know, I'm very tight with the Dean.

17:36.934 --> 17:38.735
He will not be pleased
when he hears about this.

17:38.769 --> 17:40.737
- You're friends with the Dean?
- I fucked his wife.

17:40.771 --> 17:41.738
Oh!

17:43.458 --> 17:45.709
What, no dinner?

17:45.744 --> 17:48.662
Oh. I didn't think you'd be hungry.

17:48.713 --> 17:50.464
I'm not.

17:50.499 --> 17:53.385
No, me neither.

17:53.419 --> 17:55.971
Hey! Would you look at that?

17:56.005 --> 17:58.056
We have something in common.

17:58.090 --> 18:00.760
That, and we're both pissed at him.

18:00.794 --> 18:02.011
I'm not pissed at him,

18:02.062 --> 18:03.930
because it would not be
appropriate for me to be...

18:03.964 --> 18:05.264
Mother.

18:05.298 --> 18:06.483
Daughter.

18:06.568 --> 18:08.569
I just wanna know what
the fuck is going on

18:08.603 --> 18:09.803
with my own life.

18:09.821 --> 18:12.072
Yep. That seems reasonable.

18:12.106 --> 18:14.025
Basic, simple things.

18:14.076 --> 18:15.776
Where am I going to school?

18:15.828 --> 18:19.280
Is he living with us?
Is he not living with us?

18:19.314 --> 18:21.616
Is someone in charge here, anyone?

18:21.651 --> 18:24.370
Or are we just going on
in this fucked-up limbo

18:24.421 --> 18:25.821
forever and ever?

18:25.839 --> 18:28.624
Sweetie, I know, I know
it doesn't make any sense.

18:28.658 --> 18:31.795
You can't sweetie me. I'm
not six years old anymore.

18:31.829 --> 18:34.631
- I need real answers.
- I know.

18:34.665 --> 18:36.466
You're right, I'm sorry. I...

18:36.500 --> 18:38.769
and I know that's nowhere near enough.

18:38.804 --> 18:40.137
I...

18:40.171 --> 18:42.523
You see, I had a plan.

18:42.558 --> 18:45.176
I did.

18:45.194 --> 18:47.946
But it just didn't work out
the way I thought it would.

18:47.981 --> 18:51.783
Oh, you thought he'd do a
good job of being in charge?

18:51.818 --> 18:53.352
Right.

18:55.956 --> 18:58.124
I have an idea. Let's get outta here.

18:58.158 --> 18:59.742
We've been cooped up all day long.

18:59.793 --> 19:01.161
We need fresh air.

19:01.195 --> 19:02.880
Whatever.

19:02.914 --> 19:05.666
That was kind of a yes, wasn't it?

19:05.700 --> 19:08.887
Come with me.

19:44.878 --> 19:46.746
Hey, man.

19:46.764 --> 19:49.716
You... you're really
hanging out down there, Rick.

19:49.750 --> 19:53.770
Yeah. I like to free-ball
with my eight ball.

19:53.804 --> 19:55.940
Evidently.

19:58.360 --> 20:02.731
Jesus.

20:02.765 --> 20:04.449
Okay. Look, Rick.

20:04.484 --> 20:07.069
Before I, uh, hand over the goods,

20:07.103 --> 20:08.436
I just... I really feel like

20:08.454 --> 20:10.106
I need to get something off my chest.

20:10.124 --> 20:11.440
All right, Charlie. It's okay.

20:11.458 --> 20:14.610
I... I was out of line today. I'm sorry.

20:14.628 --> 20:16.713
I mean, you're my agent.
You're not my errand boy.

20:16.747 --> 20:20.467
Wow! I'm... I'm surprised.

20:20.502 --> 20:23.253
Well, okay. Uh, thank you, Rick.

20:23.287 --> 20:24.805
- I appreciate that.
- Okay. So?

20:24.839 --> 20:27.842
- Coca!
- Absolutely.

20:27.893 --> 20:29.761
I'm just... I'm very
thirsty. It was a long trip.

20:29.795 --> 20:33.649
I see you got a cooler.
I need some refreshment.

20:40.808 --> 20:43.777
Where is she?

20:43.811 --> 20:46.646
Marcy, where are you? I
know you're in here, Marcy.

20:48.282 --> 20:52.336
Uh-Oh.

20:52.371 --> 20:54.122
I don't know what shocks me more...

20:54.156 --> 20:57.292
The fact that you've obviously
completely replaced me

20:57.326 --> 21:01.096
or that you jeopardize your
sobriety for this fuckwit!

21:01.131 --> 21:04.000
Oh! This fuckwit...

21:04.018 --> 21:05.835
happens to be one of the kindest,

21:05.853 --> 21:08.471
gentlest lovers I've ever known.

21:08.505 --> 21:11.057
Ha! Yeah, I know a couple
of strippers out there

21:11.108 --> 21:13.177
who might dispute that assessment.

21:13.195 --> 21:16.814
Hey, watch it, Runkle.
Gimme my fucking blow!

21:22.739 --> 21:26.041
Ha ha ha ha ha!

21:26.075 --> 21:27.910
Oh, shit!

21:27.961 --> 21:29.662
You looking to get your ass fired?

21:29.696 --> 21:31.664
- That's not possible.
- Really? Why is that?

21:31.698 --> 21:33.132
Because I fire you first! That's right.

21:33.167 --> 21:35.335
I don't care how much
business you bring in.

21:35.369 --> 21:38.138
You're an emotional fucking
albatross, Rick Springfield,

21:38.173 --> 21:39.306
and I'm through with you!

21:39.340 --> 21:40.924
Charlie, perspective.

21:40.975 --> 21:44.712
You wanna go back to slinging
beemers in the Valley?

21:49.935 --> 21:51.720
Maybe I got carried away.

21:51.738 --> 21:54.106
- What I meant to say is...
- Ha ha ha ha.

21:54.157 --> 21:57.193
No, no, no, no.
It's too late, fucker.

21:57.227 --> 21:58.495
You're dead to me.

21:58.529 --> 22:00.113
And you can tell that old cooze Collini

22:00.164 --> 22:01.748
that the whole Harry Greenberg agency

22:01.783 --> 22:03.399
is fuckin' dead to me too.

22:03.417 --> 22:05.118
Fuck you!

22:05.169 --> 22:08.405
And... and fuck your Z3
and fuck your dumb bald head

22:08.423 --> 22:10.925
and your small, shitty life!

22:10.959 --> 22:13.377
Now, gimme my blow and
get the fuck outta here!

22:13.411 --> 22:14.797
Gladly.

22:14.848 --> 22:17.216
Oh! Ah!

22:17.250 --> 22:19.351
Shit! What the fuck?

22:21.972 --> 22:23.923
Like your dream crush now, Marcy?

22:23.941 --> 22:25.225
Damn it!

22:25.259 --> 22:28.094
It's like watching a figure skater fall.

22:28.112 --> 22:30.931
Come on, baby, let's go.
We're getting out of here.

22:44.781 --> 22:47.967
<i>Incoming, boom, boom.</i>

22:48.001 --> 22:51.304
<i>Boom! And the little bird said...</i>

22:51.338 --> 22:53.056
<i>Dad!</i>

22:53.091 --> 22:54.725
Oh! Oh, yes.

22:54.759 --> 22:56.760
I thought you hated Chelsea.

22:56.794 --> 22:59.129
Well, since when did
you care what I think?

22:59.147 --> 23:02.466
Anyway, the point is to
say what you wanted to say.

23:02.484 --> 23:04.936
Come on.

23:06.972 --> 23:08.490
Knock, knock.

23:08.525 --> 23:10.976
Don't be afraid. We come in peace.

23:10.994 --> 23:12.912
Hello! Chelsea!

23:12.946 --> 23:15.749
Look who's here! Come on in.

23:15.783 --> 23:17.117
- I see.
- Thank you!

23:17.151 --> 23:19.252
I'm just not sure I give a shit.

23:19.287 --> 23:21.087
I guess that's what passes for a welcome

23:21.122 --> 23:22.655
around here these days.

23:22.840 --> 23:25.293
I just came to say I'm sorry

23:25.327 --> 23:27.828
for punching you in the face.

23:27.846 --> 23:30.014
And calling you a stupid twat.

23:30.048 --> 23:33.769
- I was highly emotional.
- Aw, look at that!

23:33.803 --> 23:37.005
<i>Rapprochement</i>... it's my
favorite part of any war.

23:37.023 --> 23:40.109
Why don't you and Becca
go up to your room?

23:40.144 --> 23:42.645
It's not necessary, okay, dad?

23:42.679 --> 23:44.447
- I'll finish dinner.
- It's fine.

23:44.481 --> 23:46.450
Now, if you two don't mind,

23:46.484 --> 23:49.703
I'm enjoying some quality
time with my dad...

23:49.738 --> 23:52.489
before he checks into
the heartbreak hotel.

23:52.523 --> 23:55.460
We know. We've been there already.

23:55.494 --> 23:57.695
Oh, come on, now, you don't
have to make it sound so dour.

23:57.713 --> 24:00.465
Well, that's a nice try,
but you want my opinion?

24:00.499 --> 24:02.301
It's so much better not to lie to them,

24:02.336 --> 24:05.004
because they kinda know
when things are shitty.

24:05.038 --> 24:07.139
I... I don't know that
things are all that...

24:07.174 --> 24:09.843
They're shitty, dad. Face it.

24:09.877 --> 24:11.878
All thanks to you know who.

24:11.896 --> 24:15.682
Look, it'd be nice if we could
blame Hank for all of this,

24:15.733 --> 24:17.218
but the fact of the matter is,

24:17.236 --> 24:18.903
it's just... it's more
complicated than that.

24:18.938 --> 24:21.739
I'm not talking about
Hank. I'm talking about mom.

24:21.774 --> 24:24.826
She's making a complete ass of herself.

24:24.860 --> 24:26.662
Well, that's true.

24:26.696 --> 24:27.746
I'm going to my room.

24:27.781 --> 24:29.564
That's where I'll be, in case,

24:29.582 --> 24:33.286
I don't know, you want to
apologize further or something.

24:35.289 --> 24:37.340
You know, I'm sure she doesn't mean it.

24:37.375 --> 24:39.759
Go on. Take a shot.

24:41.380 --> 24:43.597
You'll be okay.

24:51.391 --> 24:53.275
You know how we could really get back

24:53.309 --> 24:56.946
at those significant others
of ours, the two of us?

24:56.947 --> 24:58.731
If we made love...

24:58.765 --> 25:01.734
that would really piss 'em off.

25:01.785 --> 25:03.603
- Huh?
- Oh, wow.

25:03.621 --> 25:05.406
- Becca!
- Too soon?

25:05.440 --> 25:07.577
You're right. It's too soon.

25:07.587 --> 25:09.276
My heart needs to heal.

25:09.294 --> 25:11.963
Hell, I'm not even sure
the little dean is up to it,

25:11.998 --> 25:13.548
you know.

25:13.582 --> 25:17.135
- How 'bout a glass of wine?
- Sold.

25:17.169 --> 25:19.621
Free at last!

25:19.639 --> 25:21.474
You know, the air, it just smells better

25:21.475 --> 25:22.925
after you've been in the big house.

25:22.959 --> 25:24.477
Thanks for doing this, by the way.

25:24.511 --> 25:25.761
I can't believe you didn't have

25:25.795 --> 25:27.647
anything better to do with your evening.

25:27.682 --> 25:30.100
Couldn't very well let
you rot in there, could I?

25:30.134 --> 25:31.651
Well, it's been done.

25:31.686 --> 25:33.687
Well, I'm the one who made
the brilliant mistake...

25:33.738 --> 25:35.573
- ... of hiring you.
- Yes, you did.

25:35.607 --> 25:37.475
And I never give up on
my brilliant mistakes.

25:37.493 --> 25:39.143
I see them through to the bitter end.

25:39.161 --> 25:40.277
Is that where we are?

25:40.329 --> 25:41.829
Because I... I knew
I recognized the place.

25:41.864 --> 25:44.166
I don't regret any of it, you know,

25:44.200 --> 25:48.170
despite the humiliation,
gossiping in the department,

25:48.204 --> 25:49.705
or the end of my marriage.

25:49.756 --> 25:52.292
Shit. You gonna go through
with this divorce thing?

25:52.326 --> 25:54.294
Sure. It's a wonderful
feeling, you know,

25:54.328 --> 25:56.012
once you realize that
it's all behind you,

25:56.047 --> 25:59.266
all that bitterness,
and anguish, and torment.

25:59.301 --> 26:00.768
Mm.

26:00.802 --> 26:02.803
I don't know, I, uh...
I've been there.

26:02.837 --> 26:04.838
I have.
But it wasn't like that for me.

26:04.856 --> 26:06.391
It was more like having

26:06.442 --> 26:09.478
a giant hole ripped in my universe.

26:09.512 --> 26:11.846
Yeah, but you never
actually let go, did you?

26:11.864 --> 26:13.682
It's the pain that
holds people together,

26:13.700 --> 26:15.568
the need to hurt one another.

26:15.619 --> 26:17.236
Once that's gone, there's nothing left.

26:17.287 --> 26:18.905
Nothing worth saving, anyway.

26:18.956 --> 26:21.291
I don't accept that.
Where's the love, lady?

26:21.326 --> 26:23.744
- The love?
- Yes. Where it be located?

26:23.795 --> 26:25.579
To misquote a '70s soul classic:

26:25.630 --> 26:27.831
"Don't make me go
Roberta Flack on your ass!"

26:27.865 --> 26:30.051
That's love, torturing each other?

26:30.086 --> 26:31.503
Half in, half out?

26:31.537 --> 26:33.538
Torture. That sounds like love to me.

26:33.556 --> 26:35.306
Well, you go on believing
that if you like.

26:35.341 --> 26:37.810
I like. That shit's romantic.

26:37.844 --> 26:39.845
I've had quite enough
torture for one lifetime.

26:39.879 --> 26:42.648
Oh, enough with doing the right thing.

26:42.682 --> 26:44.985
I never thought you'd be
one of those types, you know?

26:45.186 --> 26:46.603
The ones who suffer in silence.

26:46.654 --> 26:49.106
No, I'm not.
I... I suffer very loudly.

26:49.157 --> 26:50.907
You should try it sometime.

26:50.942 --> 26:52.226
No, thanks.

26:52.244 --> 26:54.112
From now on, I'd just rather be happy.

26:54.163 --> 26:55.729
So that's it?

26:55.747 --> 26:57.365
You discovered the key to happiness

26:57.399 --> 26:58.899
in one short semester?

26:58.917 --> 27:02.287
Well, I did have a little help.

27:02.338 --> 27:05.541
Thanks, professor!

27:05.575 --> 27:07.176
You know if you ever decide

27:07.210 --> 27:09.546
to rethink that philosophy of yours,

27:09.580 --> 27:11.080
let me know.

27:11.098 --> 27:13.082
I'll be around.

27:26.422 --> 27:29.022
