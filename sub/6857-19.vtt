00:15.166 --> 00:16.631
<i>A calculated risk.</i>

00:16.842 --> 00:19.511
<i>Following a costly victory
on the planet Malastare,</i>

00:19.531 --> 00:21.828
<i>Chancellor Palpatine orders Jedi knights...</i>

00:21.852 --> 00:23.784
<i>Mace Windu and Anakin Skywalker...</i>

00:23.814 --> 00:28.765
<i>to transport a fearsome Zillo beast captured
during the battle back to Coruscant.</i>

00:28.778 --> 00:31.992
<i>After seeing that not even
a lightsaber could harm the beast,</i>

00:32.200 --> 00:35.826
<i>Chancellor Palpatine hopes to unlock
the secret of its invulnerability...</i>

00:35.841 --> 00:38.964
<i>to create new armour
for the Republic's clone troopers.</i>

00:39.310 --> 00:43.247
<i>Tensions run high as the most
dangerous life form in the galaxy...</i>

00:43.275 --> 00:46.350
<i>touches down on the Republic's
most populous planet.</i>

00:51.912 --> 00:55.435
- Let's go. Moving! Moving!
- Come on! Come on!

00:55.445 --> 00:56.601
I can see 'em!

01:12.828 --> 01:15.178
- You are clear.
- Copy that.

01:24.515 --> 01:26.447
- No, don't stop!
- Yes, sir.

01:36.613 --> 01:38.038
Your Excellency.

01:40.099 --> 01:43.894
Such size. Such power.

01:44.184 --> 01:46.152
With respect, Chancellor,

01:46.166 --> 01:49.088
I believe this creature could pose
any number of dangers.

01:49.108 --> 01:52.028
Bringing it here to Coruscant is a mistake.

01:52.069 --> 01:56.285
I assure you, I did not make this
decision lightly, Master Jedi.

01:56.292 --> 01:59.411
The sooner we unlock
this Zillo beast's secrets,

01:59.437 --> 02:04.333
- ...the sooner we can end this terrible war.
- I hope you're right, Chancellor.

02:12.730 --> 02:17.553
I'm turning the Zillo beast over to you,
Doctor. I trust it will be given good care.

02:17.564 --> 02:20.434
The beast is a priceless resource,
Master Windu.

02:20.444 --> 02:23.244
It will be well treated, I assure you.

02:52.376 --> 02:54.913
Why would the Chancellor
want to bring the beast here?

02:54.927 --> 02:58.173
I know he thinks that by studying it,
the knowledge could prove beneficial,

02:58.182 --> 03:02.336
but from what you and Anakin reported on
Malastare, it hardly seems worth the effort.

03:02.371 --> 03:05.832
I raised the issue with the Chancellor
during the battle of Malastare,

03:05.852 --> 03:07.740
without success.

03:08.820 --> 03:13.297
Well then, in that case, perhaps
it's time we let someone else try.

03:42.850 --> 03:44.107
That's enough.

03:53.558 --> 03:56.731
Its scales are remarkably strong and light.

03:56.747 --> 03:58.915
If we could examine their composition,

03:58.935 --> 04:03.225
we might be able to synthesise them
to reinforce our Clone armour.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.064
And what is stopping you?

04:05.088 --> 04:07.824
We need to remove the scales first.

04:07.827 --> 04:11.109
It's very difficult, not to mention painful.

04:11.129 --> 04:14.299
Would it not be more efficient
to simply kill the beast?

04:15.892 --> 04:17.930
Kill it?! Are you sure?

04:18.168 --> 04:22.806
Chancellor, I must protest.
Besides being the last of its kind,

04:22.820 --> 04:25.443
this creature may be intelligent.

04:25.459 --> 04:29.230
I find that hard to believe.
It is, after all, just an animal.

04:30.270 --> 04:32.580
It didn't seem to like your comment.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.581
I applaud your high moral stance, Doctor.

04:36.799 --> 04:39.976
After all, principle
is in short supply these days.

04:40.046 --> 04:44.291
However, every passing minute
of warfare brings countless deaths.

04:44.729 --> 04:48.087
Deaths that could be prevented once
the beast's secrets are unlocked.

04:48.216 --> 04:52.914
If there is any way we hasten that process,
it is our moral duty to explore it.

04:52.949 --> 04:58.447
I serve at your pleasure, Chancellor.
I'm just not sure where to begin.

04:58.450 --> 05:02.116
The fact remains that
the beast is indestructible.

05:02.137 --> 05:05.377
Nothing is truly indestructible, Doctor.

05:05.674 --> 05:09.381
Wasn't there something in Malastare
fuel that affected the beast?

05:09.416 --> 05:14.841
- It weakened the Zillo, yes, but...
- Excellent. I suggest you start there.

05:15.345 --> 05:19.109
Doctor, you need to find a way
to kill that beast.

05:19.304 --> 05:23.000
Or we shall replace you
with someone who can.

05:51.824 --> 05:55.306
<i>Oh, hello! You're not
in trouble again, are you?</i>

05:56.727 --> 05:58.183
<i>I am not being rude!</i>

05:58.521 --> 06:03.556
Not that it isn't a pleasure, Senator, but
I thought I was just meeting Obi-Wan here.

06:03.648 --> 06:07.115
Master Kenobi explained the problem.
I'm here to help.

06:07.159 --> 06:10.062
Problem? What problem?

06:10.472 --> 06:14.011
The situation with our friend
from Malastare.

06:15.110 --> 06:16.712
I see what's going on here.

06:17.009 --> 06:19.133
You think I could help
influence the Chancellor.

06:19.226 --> 06:22.069
The Zillo beast was chained up
and brought here against its will.

06:22.337 --> 06:27.436
It has no voice to defend itself.
Anakin, we have to be that voice.

06:28.411 --> 06:29.889
You haven't seen it in action!

06:29.919 --> 06:32.134
You have no idea what it's capable of.

06:32.144 --> 06:34.743
It's what we're capable of
that frightens me.

06:34.806 --> 06:39.170
A creature's life, maybe even
an entire species, is at stake.

06:39.236 --> 06:41.998
Doesn't that at least warrant a discussion?

06:42.973 --> 06:45.305
I didn't think you'd feel
so strongly about it.

06:46.010 --> 06:50.703
Alright, let's speak to the Chancellor.
But I still don't like this.

06:51.986 --> 06:56.028
I should have known secrets do not
stay secret for long around here.

06:56.619 --> 06:59.335
Isn't that precisely
the point of a democracy?

06:59.355 --> 07:02.429
Of course in war time,
some things must be kept secret,

07:02.445 --> 07:04.807
even from the people,
so as not to aid the enemy.

07:04.833 --> 07:08.292
It is unfortunate that the beast
must die, Senator,

07:08.380 --> 07:10.110
but the greater good demands it.

07:10.130 --> 07:12.484
How is killing the last of a species,

07:12.509 --> 07:15.533
in secret and without debate,
good for anyone?

07:15.671 --> 07:20.734
Don't you have more pressing issues
that require your attention today?

07:20.860 --> 07:23.465
No, Mr. Speaker, I do not.

07:23.478 --> 07:27.715
I sympathise, my dear.
Truly I do. But consider this--

07:27.939 --> 07:31.840
A democracy is only as strong
as the people who comprise it.

07:31.855 --> 07:36.946
At present, the people I encharged with
protecting are dying faster than I can count.

07:37.836 --> 07:41.596
It is my moral imperative to take action.

07:41.612 --> 07:45.676
Anakin, is it not worth
the life of one savage beast...

07:45.697 --> 07:49.321
to give our brave troops the
advantage they need to win this war?

07:50.922 --> 07:56.007
My role is not to set policy, Chancellor,
but I do see both points of view.

07:56.225 --> 07:59.098
I'm certain a reasonable solution
will present itself.

07:59.133 --> 08:03.084
- Master Kenobi has taught you well.
- Chancellor?

08:04.634 --> 08:06.136
Excuse me.

08:08.085 --> 08:12.304
You are supposed to be helping!
Whose side are you on anyway?

08:12.320 --> 08:16.951
Yours, but you must admit the
Chancellor made some good points.

08:24.789 --> 08:28.720
<i>Ah, Doctor Po. I trust you
have some progress to report?</i>

08:28.950 --> 08:30.720
Yes, Chancellor.

08:30.738 --> 08:35.284
I was able to convert the Malastare
fuel toxin into a poison gas.

08:35.320 --> 08:38.619
I believe it's now strong enough
to kill the Zillo beast.

08:38.645 --> 08:42.140
If... that's still how you wish to proceed.

08:42.155 --> 08:44.114
<i>I wish I saw an alternative.</i>

08:44.131 --> 08:48.554
<i>However, sadly, I must ask you
to proceed with your assignment.</i>

09:03.241 --> 09:07.500
I'm sorry. Don't worry.
It will all be over soon.

09:07.878 --> 09:09.504
Begin procedure.

09:13.516 --> 09:15.110
Vital signs are dropping.

09:28.578 --> 09:30.729
No! It should've been enough!

09:52.001 --> 09:53.655
I don't like the sound of that.

09:53.674 --> 09:57.476
If that creature's as powerful as they say,
what good will these rifles are gonna be?

09:57.495 --> 09:59.312
Shut up, Kosmos!

10:18.737 --> 10:20.190
Take it down! Take it down!

10:20.462 --> 10:21.524
Let's go!

10:23.238 --> 10:25.786
- Go! Go! Go!
- Hold the line, everyone!

10:29.364 --> 10:31.065
Oh, no...

10:33.908 --> 10:35.923
Doctor, were you successful?

10:35.939 --> 10:37.533
<i>We have a problem, sir.</i>

10:48.402 --> 10:52.208
<i>We need time to convert Malastare
fuel into more toxin, Chancellor.</i>

10:52.219 --> 10:54.030
I suggest you hurry, Doctor.

10:54.070 --> 10:56.630
Evacuate the staff to
the underground shelters.

10:57.112 --> 10:59.463
Stay with General Kenobi.
I'm on my way.

10:59.483 --> 11:02.206
Better hurry, Sir.
You're missing all the fun.

12:06.932 --> 12:08.571
It's coming this way!

12:35.213 --> 12:38.578
Perhaps now would be a good time
to evacuate to the lower levels.

12:44.645 --> 12:47.132
Yes. We are going now.

12:59.516 --> 13:01.403
<i>Desperately needed the tanks are.</i>

13:01.424 --> 13:03.825
We're almost at the loading dock,
Master Yoda.

13:04.067 --> 13:06.010
Dire the situation has become.

13:06.226 --> 13:09.769
Before more lives are lost,
act quickly we must.

13:16.452 --> 13:20.183
My security staff insisted on adding
this emergency escape route.

13:27.510 --> 13:30.804
<i>Chancellor, I think we may have
enough toxin now.</i>

13:30.819 --> 13:32.662
My guards will be with you shortly.

13:35.916 --> 13:39.542
- Hand the gas to them immediately.
- Does it have to be destroyed?

13:39.980 --> 13:42.976
- The Jedi stun cannons...
- Will not eliminate the problem!

13:43.004 --> 13:45.888
Our advanced technology
simply cannot contain it.

13:46.547 --> 13:48.713
I wish we had never brought
the beast here.

13:51.703 --> 13:56.226
<i>Pardon me, Mistress Padmé,
but I believe something is following us.</i>

13:57.450 --> 13:58.635
Evasive action!

14:09.440 --> 14:10.571
<i>We're doomed!</i>

14:17.045 --> 14:21.274
All tanks acquire solution
and prepare to fire on my order.

14:21.309 --> 14:22.714
Hold your fire!

14:22.897 --> 14:25.121
In the beast's clutches the Chancellor is.

14:25.142 --> 14:27.738
Anakin might be with him,
and Senator Amidala.

14:27.749 --> 14:30.912
If the beast falls,
at risk their lives shall be.

14:43.445 --> 14:45.468
Got an idea, but it's risky.

14:45.595 --> 14:48.559
Considering the circumstances,
I'll take the risk.

14:52.734 --> 14:55.074
I've got a bad feeling about this.

14:56.691 --> 14:59.416
Sir, looks like the General's
up to something.

15:01.436 --> 15:03.895
What is Skywalker doing?!

15:05.418 --> 15:08.637
It appears to be one of Anakin's
improvised plans.

15:08.696 --> 15:11.505
How can it be a plan if it's improvised?

15:11.525 --> 15:14.230
Not to worry.
Just catch them when they fall.

15:14.249 --> 15:16.966
A lot of the General's plans
involve falling.

15:16.986 --> 15:20.257
Distract the beast we shall,
to give Skykwalker more time.

15:46.224 --> 15:48.112
I hope you know what you're doing.

15:49.395 --> 15:51.701
Here's where the fun begins. Hang on!

16:05.681 --> 16:06.857
Catch it!

16:30.480 --> 16:31.626
Anny!

17:04.997 --> 17:07.308
All pilots, fire!

17:39.589 --> 17:41.747
Sir, we have to get you out of here.

17:49.060 --> 17:50.929
R2, get over there!

17:55.543 --> 17:57.981
He can't carry both of us.
You go, sir.

18:09.227 --> 18:11.237
<i>¡No!</i>

18:11.272 --> 18:14.813
- We aren't having much of an effect.
- Time to leave it is!

18:18.470 --> 18:19.918
<i>Oh, no!</i>

18:23.053 --> 18:24.204
Let's go!

18:31.116 --> 18:32.796
Use the gas bombs!

18:33.064 --> 18:34.107
Copy that!

18:40.275 --> 18:41.610
Bombs away!

20:26.557 --> 20:30.148
It's a tragedy that the Zillo beast
paid with its life for our mistakes.

20:30.173 --> 20:33.717
I will make certain that sacrifice
was not made in vain.

20:41.549 --> 20:43.910
Doctor, a word if you please.

20:44.909 --> 20:47.866
- Your new orders.
- What is this?

20:48.550 --> 20:51.727
You want me to clone the beast?!
