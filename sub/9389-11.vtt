00:01.585 --> 00:05.088
(SINGING)
It seems today that all you see

00:05.172 --> 00:08.258
Is violence in movies and sex on TV

00:08.342 --> 00:11.428
But where are those
Good old-fashioned values

00:11.762 --> 00:14.223
ALL: On which we used to rely?

00:14.932 --> 00:18.101
Lucky there's a family guy

00:18.185 --> 00:21.438
Lucky there's a man who positively can do

00:21.522 --> 00:22.940
All the things that make us

00:23.232 --> 00:24.983
Laugh and cry

00:25.067 --> 00:29.821
ALL: He's a family guy!

00:42.125 --> 00:44.545
Ah, the annual
Quahog Star Trek Convention,

00:44.628 --> 00:46.255
where once a year, sci-fi buffs

00:46.338 --> 00:48.340
take their lips off the barrel
of a loaded gun

00:48.423 --> 00:50.634
and spend half a day adjusting
their eyes to sunlight.

00:54.263 --> 00:55.639
Brian, look... I've purchased

00:55.722 --> 00:58.016
authentic blueprints to build
a Star Trek transporter.

00:58.100 --> 00:59.643
Well, that's great, Stewie.

00:59.726 --> 01:01.478
You should get William Shatner
to sign 'em for you.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.897
No way! I'm getting
Patrick Stewart to sign it.

01:03.981 --> 01:05.858
Picard has it all over Kirk.

01:05.941 --> 01:08.652
He's poised and measured
and doesn't wear a cheap rug.

01:08.861 --> 01:11.613
Rather, he accepts even
baldness with a quiet cool

01:11.697 --> 01:14.992
that says, "I am in command.
You are safe with me.

01:15.075 --> 01:18.787
"I will cradle you in my arms
through any crisis in any galaxy."

01:19.538 --> 01:21.665
-Are you queer?
-Probably.

01:21.748 --> 01:24.293
Dad, this is stupid. I'm so bored!

01:24.459 --> 01:26.795
How can you be bored?
This convention has everything.

01:26.879 --> 01:29.047
You can even try on
LeVar Burton's visor.

01:32.134 --> 01:33.427
(SCREAMING)

01:33.927 --> 01:35.929
Why would he wear these?

01:36.013 --> 01:38.140
Who would invent these for him?

01:40.517 --> 01:42.019
And in conclusion,

01:42.102 --> 01:45.772
whether your dreams are
earthbound or set in the stars,

01:46.356 --> 01:49.443
follow your heart and make it so.

01:50.861 --> 01:53.822
Ooh-hoo-hoo, boy, oh, he said
the thing he says on TV!

01:53.947 --> 01:57.451
Now, the cast and I would be
happy to answer a few questions.

01:57.784 --> 01:58.994
Oh, yes, so many questions!

01:59.077 --> 02:01.330
Me! Me! Mr. Stewart! Mr. Stewart!

02:01.413 --> 02:05.250
M-Stewart! M-Stewart! Stew! Stew!

02:05.334 --> 02:07.628
Stuh! Stuh! Stuh! Stuh!

02:07.836 --> 02:09.838
-Yes? You there.
-Oh!

02:09.922 --> 02:11.048
Yes, I have a question.

02:11.131 --> 02:13.175
Um, oftentimes, my household sponges

02:13.258 --> 02:15.344
accumulate an awful amount of buildup.

02:15.427 --> 02:17.095
What can I do to prevent this?

02:17.179 --> 02:20.390
That's an excellent question.
It's very important

02:20.474 --> 02:23.352
to thoroughly wring out
your sponges after every usage.

02:23.435 --> 02:26.647
This will prevent the accumulation
of grime and bacteria.

02:26.730 --> 02:28.941
A dry sponge is a happy sponge.

02:29.024 --> 02:30.776
That's not a Star Trek question!

02:30.859 --> 02:32.611
I have a question
for Jonathan Frakes.

02:32.694 --> 02:34.947
I have this itch
on the back of my leg,

02:35.030 --> 02:37.282
and I can't figure out
if it's a bug bite or dry skin.

02:37.449 --> 02:39.034
-Do you take hot showers?
-Yes.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.369
-Dry skin.
-Thanks.

02:40.452 --> 02:42.913
These aren't Star Trek questions!
What the hell?

02:42.996 --> 02:44.623
I have a question for Gates McFadden.

02:44.831 --> 02:46.792
I've got an artesian well on my property,

02:46.875 --> 02:49.419
and the water pressure is lousy.
Any suggestions?

02:49.503 --> 02:52.089
I would check the point first,
before re-priming it.

02:52.339 --> 02:54.007
But remember that the summer months

02:54.091 --> 02:56.009
take a particular toll
on any region's aquifer,

02:56.093 --> 02:57.553
depending on the local climate.

02:57.636 --> 03:00.097
-This is horse (BLEEP)
-And that's the last question.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.016
Thank you for coming.
You've been wonderful.

03:03.392 --> 03:05.853
(CHEERING, SHOUTING)

03:05.936 --> 03:07.312
(QUIETLY) You bastards!

03:07.396 --> 03:09.481
I'll get my question answered
one way or another!

03:11.024 --> 03:13.318
Oh, my God, what a great costume!

03:13.402 --> 03:15.863
Meg, Meg, come take your picture
with this space alien guy!

03:16.154 --> 03:17.573
No, Dad! I don't want to!

03:17.656 --> 03:18.907
Come on! It'll be funny!

03:19.116 --> 03:20.784
(SIGHS)

03:21.159 --> 03:24.580
Ha-ha-ha! What a wonderful
novelty photo this will make!

03:24.663 --> 03:25.956
Thanks so much, buddy.

03:26.039 --> 03:27.666
Hey, how'd you make that awesome mask?

03:27.749 --> 03:29.877
It's not a mask... I have the mumps.

03:30.043 --> 03:33.130
What? You came to a Star Trek
convention with the mumps?

03:33.213 --> 03:35.048
You could be infecting people
with a disease!

03:35.424 --> 03:37.593
Yeah, like that old gypsy
did to Britney Spears

03:37.676 --> 03:38.927
in that Stephen King book.

03:39.428 --> 03:41.054
(SOFTLY) Thicker!

03:44.850 --> 03:46.518
Well, Meg has the mumps, all right.

03:46.602 --> 03:48.145
How is it she was
never immunized?

03:48.228 --> 03:50.314
Well, it was 1992,
and I couldn't be bothered

03:50.397 --> 03:52.566
with anything that didn't
involve Dan Cortese.

03:52.649 --> 03:55.068
Besides, what's the big deal?
I never got a mumps shot.

03:55.152 --> 03:57.446
Really? Well, I'd caution
you that getting the mumps

03:57.529 --> 03:59.698
as an adult could result
in serious complications.

03:59.948 --> 04:02.826
In some cases, the symptoms could
spread to the testicular glands.

04:03.035 --> 04:04.411
Big deal... So I'll wear socks.

04:04.494 --> 04:06.496
Mr. Griffin, your testicles
are not in your feet.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.624
-Well, where are they?
-Under your penis.

04:08.707 --> 04:11.251
Are you kidding? I always thought
those were two little sandbags

04:11.335 --> 04:13.378
to keep floodwaters from
floating into my bum.

04:13.587 --> 04:16.131
(CHUCKLES) No, no,
I'm just poking at your funny bone.

04:16.215 --> 04:17.549
I am quite alarmed.

04:17.633 --> 04:19.468
I don't think you realize the danger.

04:19.551 --> 04:22.596
Like the people who think it's okay
to bring shampoo on an airplane!

04:22.846 --> 04:24.556
So, I told Brenda, I work hard,

04:24.640 --> 04:26.725
I like a clean house when I come home.

04:27.017 --> 04:28.769
And now I'm the bad guy.

04:28.852 --> 04:30.687
Oh, I know exactly where you're coming...

04:30.771 --> 04:32.189
Ow! It's in my eyes!

04:38.362 --> 04:40.197

Come here, come here, look.

04:40.531 --> 04:41.573

to be in bed all day,

bringing in the old TV.

05:03.887 --> 05:06.557
I don't want to catch the mumps, Lois.
Here's your TV, Meg.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.184
It's a little old and there's no remote
and it only gets one channel

05:09.268 --> 05:10.978
and it's not on that channel right now.

God will always be there for you,

05:55.272 --> 05:56.398

Are you lonely, unappreciated,

with your physical appearance?

Are you unloved?

06:04.698 --> 06:06.950
Do you feel like
no one cares about you?

06:07.034 --> 06:09.369
Meg, your mother made soup for you.

Hey, did you hook up with
Whhoopi Goldberg on the show?

09:29.820 --> 09:31.113
All the time.

09:32.990 --> 09:34.741
Meg, what the hell?
I was watching that!

09:34.825 --> 09:36.201
It's time for Kirk Cameron.

09:36.285 --> 09:38.620
And I think it's important
for all of you to hear

09:38.704 --> 09:40.706
his inspiring message
about the Word of God.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.541
(GROANS) Oh, again, Meg?

09:42.624 --> 09:45.085
You know, I think it's wonderful
you found something to have faith in,

09:45.169 --> 09:46.920
but there's such
a thing as moderation.

09:47.004 --> 09:49.423
Ugh, Mom! You sound like a nonbeliever!

09:49.756 --> 09:51.800
Brian, you're a thoughtful person...

09:51.884 --> 09:54.511
Are you willing to open
yourself up to God's truth?

09:54.595 --> 09:57.389
Oh, you're barking up the wrong tree, Meg.
I'm an atheist.

09:57.472 --> 09:58.974
-(ALL GASP)
-What's that?

09:59.141 --> 10:00.934
I don't believe in God.

10:01.018 --> 10:02.477
What?

10:02.561 --> 10:04.938
Brian, how can you say that?

10:05.022 --> 10:06.732
Why, I just thought you knew.

10:06.815 --> 10:09.318
I mean, I never go to church...
You know how I feel about that.

10:09.526 --> 10:12.529
No, Brian, it's one thing
to bash organized religion,

10:12.613 --> 10:14.823
but we believe in God in this house.

10:15.073 --> 10:16.491
I mean, an atheist?

10:16.783 --> 10:19.077
That's just about the worst
thing a person can be.

10:19.328 --> 10:21.788
You're not gonna get anything
for Christmas, Brian!

10:21.872 --> 10:24.499
-Guys, I'm just trying to say...
-Shut up, beast!

10:24.583 --> 10:26.001
I have dominion over you,

10:26.084 --> 10:27.753
and I command you to believe in God!

10:27.961 --> 10:30.005
I'm sorry, I just don't see any evidence.

10:30.464 --> 10:32.257
I mean, look at the Hubble Telescope.

10:32.341 --> 10:34.343
It's discovered untold wonders of a vast,

10:34.593 --> 10:36.762
unexplored universe, but not one picture

10:36.845 --> 10:39.181
of a guy with a beard
sitting around on a cloud.

10:39.264 --> 10:40.682
I mean, what's he doing up there?

10:41.058 --> 10:42.351
(SINGING)
God!

10:42.434 --> 10:43.894
Ah, ah

10:44.937 --> 10:46.522
He's a miracle

10:48.482 --> 10:50.651
You know, you keep talking like that,
God's gonna get you, Brian.

10:50.817 --> 10:52.778
He's gonna get you with the Kodak Disc.

10:52.861 --> 10:55.489
(SINGING)
Oh, God's gonna getcha with the Kodak Disc

10:56.073 --> 10:57.908
I'm sorry, what were
we talking about?

11:02.579 --> 11:04.540
Hey! Where the hell is my van?

11:08.085 --> 11:10.587
Stewie, I'm not really
much of a fast food eater.

11:10.671 --> 11:13.257
Yeah? Can you read my mind?
Can you tell what I'm thinking right now?

11:13.340 --> 11:14.800
I'm thinking, "Shut up and get a salad."

11:14.883 --> 11:17.261
-I want some McNuggets.
-We'll get to you, Brent!

11:17.344 --> 11:19.930
I want a hamburger...
No, a Cheeseburger.

11:20.013 --> 11:22.015
I want a hot dog, I want a milkshake.

11:22.099 --> 11:23.559
You'll get nothing and like it!

11:23.642 --> 11:24.643
Uh, hello?

11:24.726 --> 11:26.478
MAN: Yes, welcome to McDonald's.
Can I help you?

11:26.603 --> 11:28.730
Oh, hailing frequencies open, huh?
(LAUGHS)

11:28.814 --> 11:30.691
Okay. Uh, yeah, we're gonna get, uh,

11:30.774 --> 11:33.485
two McChicken sandwiches
and a Diet Coke and...

11:33.569 --> 11:35.904
-Uh, uh, what do you want, Michael?
-A McDLT.

11:35.988 --> 11:38.156
No, I already told you,
they don't make those anymore.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.951
You know, sometimes it's a regional thing.
You could ask.

11:41.034 --> 11:43.871
No McDonald's anywhere
makes a McDLT anymore.

11:43.954 --> 11:46.081
I'd love a Shamrock Shake,
if they've got any of those.

11:46.164 --> 11:47.374
It's September, Jonathan!

11:47.457 --> 11:49.585
Stewie, can I take this
(BLEEP) headband off?

11:49.668 --> 11:52.045
No, LeVar. You're blind.
That's the only way you can see.

11:52.129 --> 11:54.756
I'm just saying, they have all
the ingredients for a McDL...

11:54.840 --> 11:56.466
-(CAR HORN BLARES)
-Just hang on, all right?

11:56.550 --> 11:59.052
There's a lot of us,
there's a lot of... It's a big order!

11:59.136 --> 12:00.721
What time do they stop
serving breakfast?

12:00.804 --> 12:02.014
It's 3:00.

12:02.097 --> 12:03.307
Some of them serve breakfast all day.

12:03.390 --> 12:04.933
None of them serve breakfast all day!

12:05.184 --> 12:06.393
Do they have beer?

12:09.396 --> 12:12.107
Hey, Brian, in hopes that
you'll open your heart to God,

12:12.191 --> 12:13.734
I wanted to give you this cross.

12:13.817 --> 12:15.194
No, I don't want a cross.

12:15.277 --> 12:17.821
Would you want it
if I threw it over there?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.823
-No, please don't do that.
-You gonna get it, boy?

12:19.907 --> 12:21.700
-No. Please, no.
-Go get it, boy!

12:21.783 --> 12:23.410
(BARKING)

12:26.121 --> 12:27.873

12:51.313 --> 12:53.982
Brian, Kirk Cameron
is the one who converted me,

12:54.066 --> 12:56.401
but unfortunately, he's not available.

12:56.652 --> 12:58.987
So, I got his younger brother
from Growing Pains.

12:59.071 --> 13:01.365
Will you guys buy me
a case of Sudafed?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.367
Don't you want
to tell Brian about Jesus?

13:03.450 --> 13:05.118
They got my picture up at the drug store,

13:05.202 --> 13:07.538
and they won't sell me any Sudafed.

13:07.621 --> 13:09.581
I'll make it worth your while.

13:09.665 --> 13:11.333
-Ben!
-Dad!

13:11.416 --> 13:13.168
Ben, what have I told you

13:13.252 --> 13:16.588
about trading sexual favors for Sudafed?

13:16.672 --> 13:19.633
Look, Meg, I've had enough of this.
You're not gonna convert me.

13:19.716 --> 13:22.803
But, Brian, I just want you
to feel the joy that I feel.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.556
I mean, the church makes
me feel accepted and safe

13:25.639 --> 13:27.724
and part of something
bigger than myself.

13:27.808 --> 13:29.893
But, Meg, you don't need an outside voice

13:29.977 --> 13:32.271
to feel those feelings.
They're inside you.

13:32.354 --> 13:35.107
What you call God is inside you,
all of us.

13:35.190 --> 13:37.860

hating and killing each other

13:37.943 --> 13:39.111

13:39.194 --> 13:40.779
of what they're not
smart enough to understand.

13:40.863 --> 13:41.989

couldn't be any more dangerous,

13:52.833 --> 13:54.877
that there is an atheist among us.

13:54.960 --> 13:57.963
Local churchgoer and Junior
Christian Soldier Meg Griffin

13:58.046 --> 14:01.383
has identified the atheist as
Brian Griffin of Spooner Street.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.218
Here's the reaction from City Hall.

14:03.302 --> 14:05.762
Shocking, to say the least.

14:05.846 --> 14:08.682
I'd rather have a terrorist
living in our midst.

14:08.765 --> 14:10.726
At least they believe in a god.

14:10.809 --> 14:13.478
Even if it's a smelly, brown god.

do something like this?

What's the worst that can happen?

People are tolerant.

14:24.781 --> 14:26.200
Well, this is nothing.

14:26.283 --> 14:28.202
Probably just a random act of violence.

14:30.204 --> 14:32.581

could cast the first Prius.

-Brian, what happened?
-I'm a pariah, Lois.

14:48.138 --> 14:49.848
Ever since Meg told everyone
I'm an atheist,

14:49.932 --> 14:51.767
I'm the most hated person in town.

14:51.892 --> 14:53.602
I tried to rent a movie
and they threw me out.

14:53.685 --> 14:56.104
I tried to buy a pack of cigarettes
and they threw me out.

14:56.188 --> 14:58.857
But the most serious part of it is,
no bar would serve me a drink.

14:58.941 --> 15:01.276
Well, if you ask me,
I think laying off the sauce

15:01.360 --> 15:03.362
-could do you some good, Brian.
-Yeah, right.

have all these problems?

off the high counter.

we're gonna get ourselves

15:15.707 --> 15:17.543
a big, tall pie-eating dog, Lois.

-Okay, Peter.
-Or Howard Huge.

Let's get Howard Huge.
Great, we have a game plan.

Hold it together.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.145
Come on, you know you want a drink.

15:37.312 --> 15:39.648
Yeah, come on, Brian, drink us.

15:39.731 --> 15:41.400
(LIKE SCHWARZENEGGER) Come on! Drink me!

15:41.483 --> 15:42.860

15:42.943 --> 15:44.653
(LISPING) Yeah, you big silly ass.

me and take a big gulp.

your bowling shoes?

15:58.166 --> 16:00.085
-Everybody got your balls?
-I don't have my shoes.

16:00.169 --> 16:01.628
Jonathan, we were just up at the counter.

16:01.712 --> 16:04.214
-Why didn't you get your shoes?
-I don't have my shoes either.

16:04.298 --> 16:06.175
What the hell...
You need your shoes to bowl!

16:06.258 --> 16:08.468
Now, why exactly
can I not wear my loafers?

16:08.552 --> 16:10.012
What is the danger there?

16:10.095 --> 16:13.473
Because, Patrick, because,
Patrick, those are the rules.

16:13.557 --> 16:16.518
Well, I think it's just because
they want another $1.50 from me.

16:17.269 --> 16:19.438
All right, I'm putting
our names in. Brent...

16:19.521 --> 16:21.356
-No, no, don't put "Brent."

I don't know how to change it.
I already typed it in!

16:24.943 --> 16:26.069
For mine, put "Dirk Diggler."

16:26.153 --> 16:27.863
I'm not gonna put everyone as a fake name!

16:27.946 --> 16:29.364
How do you want to do the teams?

16:29.448 --> 16:31.283
How about the white guys
against the black guys?

16:31.366 --> 16:33.285
-Patrick, don't be an instigator.
-I have to pee.

16:33.368 --> 16:35.245
Brent, take Michael
to the bathroom, please.

16:35.329 --> 16:36.705
Okay.

Hey, Meg, guess what? I've seen the light.

16:53.055 --> 16:56.058
-Really?
-Yes. Hallelujah, I believe in God!

16:56.141 --> 16:57.559
Lordy, Lordy, I believe.

16:57.643 --> 17:00.437
Oh, Brian, that's fantastic news!

17:00.521 --> 17:01.647
I know, I know.

17:01.730 --> 17:03.482
Hey, you mind spreading
the news around town?

17:03.565 --> 17:06.693
Say, maybe down at the liquor store,
maybe down at The Clam.

17:06.777 --> 17:08.070
Of course, Brian.

17:08.153 --> 17:10.572
But first, we have work to do...
God's work.

17:10.864 --> 17:12.866
And God will be happy
that you're joining me.

17:12.991 --> 17:14.826
Then I say let's celebrate the way

17:14.910 --> 17:16.495
they did in the Bible, with wine.

17:16.578 --> 17:18.372
Red wine, you know, like Jesus drank.

17:19.289 --> 17:22.000
-Do you like the wine?
-Very much. What is it?

17:22.084 --> 17:23.794
Take a guess.

17:24.127 --> 17:25.921
-I have to leave.
-(LOCK CLICKS)

17:26.129 --> 17:28.215
Nah, sit down.

17:30.676 --> 17:32.970
(SIGHS) Thanks for setting
everyone straight, Meg.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.472
I feel the warm, healing, liquid presence

17:35.556 --> 17:37.975
of God's genuine, cold-filtered grace.

17:38.058 --> 17:39.560
It was my pleasure, Brian.

17:39.643 --> 17:42.396
And now we get to do the work of the Lord.

17:42.896 --> 17:44.106
Come on!

17:44.189 --> 17:46.733
-What? What are we doing?
-God's will, Brian.

17:50.487 --> 17:53.073
-A book burning?
-Come on, grab an armful!

17:53.156 --> 17:55.576
We have to destroy everything
that's harmful to God!

18:02.332 --> 18:04.668
Meg, I can't be a part of this,
and neither should you!

18:04.751 --> 18:07.629
What are you talking about?
I thought you'd seen the light, Brian.

18:07.713 --> 18:10.716
Well, to be honest, I lied for booze.
But, Meg, you're a smart girl.

18:10.799 --> 18:13.260
You ought to be able to see that
what's going on here is wrong.

18:13.343 --> 18:15.971
You are not gonna turn me
from my faith, Brian.

18:17.598 --> 18:20.058
Okay, fine. Then let me just ask you this.

18:20.142 --> 18:23.270
If there were a God, would
He have put you here on Earth

18:23.353 --> 18:24.980
with a flat chest and a fat ass?

18:25.522 --> 18:28.734
-I'm made in His image.
-Really?

18:29.109 --> 18:31.278
Would He give you
a smoking hot mom like Lois,

18:31.361 --> 18:33.155
and then have you grow up
looking like Peter?

18:33.238 --> 18:34.239
Well...

18:34.323 --> 18:36.283
And what kind of God
would put you in a house

18:36.366 --> 18:38.202
where no one respects or cares about you,

18:38.285 --> 18:40.537
not even enough to get you
a damn mumps shot?

18:41.580 --> 18:43.207
Oh, no.

18:43.832 --> 18:45.501
You're right, Brian.

18:45.584 --> 18:46.877
You're right.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.128
I'm sorry, Meg.

18:48.212 --> 18:50.672
But what is there
to believe in without God?

18:50.923 --> 18:52.591
Where do the answers come from?

18:52.674 --> 18:54.551
Well, that's all part
of the human experience.

18:54.676 --> 18:56.345
It's what we're here to find out.

18:56.720 --> 18:58.514
And I bet you that the real answer

18:58.597 --> 18:59.806
to the nature of our existence

18:59.890 --> 19:01.850
is gonna be more unimaginably amazing

19:01.934 --> 19:03.644
than we can possibly conceive.

20:06.164 --> 20:07.457
Rob.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.043
Did you hear that?

20:10.586 --> 20:11.879
Hear what?

20:11.962 --> 20:13.755
I swear I heard something.

20:14.798 --> 20:17.718
(SIGHS WEARILY) Oh, Adam,
we've been over and over this.

20:18.093 --> 20:19.845
There is nothing under your bed,

20:19.928 --> 20:21.972
there is nothing in the closet,

20:22.097 --> 20:26.059
there are no such things
as monsters, all right?

20:28.353 --> 20:29.438
All right, I guess.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.356
Good.

20:31.565 --> 20:33.525
Now try to go to sleep,
'cause we got to get up

20:33.609 --> 20:34.985
in the morning and make movies.

20:35.819 --> 20:37.404
We're big Hollywood actors.

20:39.323 --> 20:40.782
Yeah, we are!

20:41.200 --> 20:42.284
(CHUCKLES)

20:54.505 --> 20:57.007
This was exhausting.

20:57.090 --> 21:00.552
This whole experience
was absolutely exhausting.

21:00.636 --> 21:03.305
You people have ruined
Star Trek: The NextGeneration for me.

21:03.388 --> 21:06.642
You are absolutely the most
insufferable group of jackasses

21:06.725 --> 21:10.229
I have ever had the misfortune of
spending an extended period of time with.

21:10.354 --> 21:12.147
I hope you all (BLEEP) die.

21:12.231 --> 21:14.483
I still have five prize tickets
from the carnival.

21:14.566 --> 21:17.277
There was nothing for five tickets!
We've been over this!

21:17.361 --> 21:19.446
Well, but LeVar and I
were going to pool ours

21:19.530 --> 21:21.156
for the fuzzy troll pencil topper.

21:21.240 --> 21:22.533
Oh, yeah? You gonna share that?

21:22.616 --> 21:23.825
Yeah, we were gonna share it.

21:23.909 --> 21:25.035
Really? How's that gonna work?

21:25.118 --> 21:26.328
Three days at my house,

21:26.411 --> 21:28.664
three days at LeVar's
and alternating Sundays.

21:28.747 --> 21:30.290
For a pencil topper?

21:30.374 --> 21:31.500
I have to pee again.

21:31.583 --> 21:32.709
That's it. Good-bye.

21:33.794 --> 21:35.003
(BLEEP)
