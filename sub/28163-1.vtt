00:28.779 --> 00:30.239
This business

00:30.239 --> 00:33.575
is a living organism

00:33.825 --> 00:37.287
Multiplying constantly
surrounded by predators

00:37.287 --> 00:41.750
There's no rule for
idle time or second guessing,

00:41.750 --> 00:45.212
New discovery are made hourly.

00:45.212 --> 00:47.798
New ideas
are ready to be devored and redefined.

00:47.798 --> 00:51.009
This business is binary

00:51.009 --> 00:53.011
you are a one or a zero,

00:53.011 --> 00:56.557
alive or dead

00:58.058 --> 00:59.059
AntiTrust

01:02.646 --> 01:06.066
There is no second place.

01:09.069 --> 01:11.405
It has been suggested
by the median congress..

01:11.405 --> 01:15.409
that you're violating antitrust laws and
threatening competition

01:15.409 --> 01:20.205
Mr. Winston, Can you reasonably deny that
you have a monopoly in this area ?

01:20.205 --> 01:21.582
Well, the only monopoly...

01:21.582 --> 01:25.294
we have at N.U.R.V,
is monopoly on excellence.

01:25.294 --> 01:26.795
It is still a free market.

01:26.795 --> 01:30.674
But a free market encourages competition
You prevent it

01:30.674 --> 01:36.346
You don't need to remind you the essence
of competition is always been quite simple,

01:36.346 --> 01:43.604
Any kid working in a garage anywhere
in the world with a good idea can put us out of business

01:45.606 --> 01:49.902
Let's try a communication scheme
if you have a good driver..

01:50.611 --> 01:53.155
Move, move

01:53.155 --> 01:57.492
Teddy, I think I have found
our bottle neck

02:02.497 --> 02:05.000
You did it !
Yee-Haw!!

02:09.003 --> 02:10.005
God! That feels good

02:10.005 --> 02:11.006
Gorgeous!

02:11.006 --> 02:13.509
We're geeks

02:19.932 --> 02:23.477
Three months from today,
N.U.R.V will launch Synapes

02:23.477 --> 02:26.980
transforming the way
humans communicate,

02:26.980 --> 02:27.481
With Synaps,

02:27.481 --> 02:30.150
the entire world will be able
to send or receive

02:30.150 --> 02:33.153
any message be in audio, video
or text on any medium

02:33.153 --> 02:37.991
any medium, any medium, ...

02:37.991 --> 02:43.789
SYNAPSE will fully unite
the global village.

02:48.585 --> 02:51.463
You set yourself real ticking clock here, Gary

02:51.463 --> 02:55.717
All of your competitor are desperate to get
to the market place with this technology before you.

02:55.717 --> 03:00.097
It has even been suggested that you won't hit
this very ambitious launch date

03:00.097 --> 03:02.057
We're going to hit that date,
you can bet on it

03:02.057 --> 03:03.225
How can you be sure?

03:03.225 --> 03:07.479
We'll do whatever it takes
to get there

03:20.576 --> 03:23.579
Pace yourself, Brian

03:23.579 --> 03:27.207
It can go here

03:27.207 --> 03:28.917
Milo, what do you think of this?

03:28.917 --> 03:31.587
I know I promise my mom
we're gonna make this garage famous

03:31.587 --> 03:34.381
but I really don't think
we're gonna be here that long

03:34.381 --> 03:38.719
'Cause I’ve got us 3 appointment
with the venture capitalists

03:38.719 --> 03:40.220
Oh, that is fantastic

03:40.220 --> 03:45.100
I can stop taking calls from
those corporate recruitment, losers

03:45.100 --> 03:48.020
I'll do the talking, Brian

03:48.020 --> 03:49.563
Guys, what are these?

03:49.563 --> 03:52.774
Don't you know the worse you look,
the smarter they think you are

03:52.774 --> 03:54.776
They are going to think
you're a genius, Brian

03:54.776 --> 03:57.738
I just have Milo and Ted,
and the wallets flew open,

03:57.738 --> 03:59.740
They were dying to give me their money.

03:59.740 --> 04:03.619
You guys are the greatest duo,
since Hewlett and Packard

04:03.619 --> 04:04.661
Lenon and McCartney

04:04.661 --> 04:05.746
Ben and Jerry

04:05.746 --> 04:08.081
Ha Ha Ha

04:08.081 --> 04:09.875
I'm Lennon, okay Teddy

04:09.875 --> 04:12.794
Does that make me Yoko?

04:14.546 --> 04:17.341
Look Alice, you got to make him
do the start up with Teddy and me

04:17.341 --> 04:23.263
Larry, if he wants to go and take a few interviews
check out his options as his friend

04:23.263 --> 04:25.766
I think you should support him in that

04:27.476 --> 04:30.270
What to know the best way
to manipulate somebody

04:30.270 --> 04:31.813
Yeah

04:31.813 --> 04:33.232
Don't try

04:33.232 --> 04:34.358
As graduating students

04:34.358 --> 04:40.572
of the Standford University, Science department,
you have a magnificent foundation in theory

04:40.572 --> 04:43.575
what you need is a creative innovative...

04:43.575 --> 04:46.578
A monopolist
Exactly

04:46.578 --> 04:49.581
the guy knows how to get peoples attention

04:49.581 --> 04:52.876
Shut up, shut up, shut up

04:52.876 --> 04:54.211
I'm trying to listen !

04:54.211 --> 04:56.088
who will fill your questions?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.548
Thanks for taking the time to check us out

04:57.548 --> 05:00.717
I look forward to seeing some of you up here
at the NURV campus, in the near future

05:00.717 --> 05:01.218
Questions, cool

05:01.218 --> 05:05.222
I got a question for him, alright?

05:08.016 --> 05:13.313
Why not make SYNAPSE open source?

05:13.313 --> 05:14.731
Don't you have enough money?

05:14.731 --> 05:16.066
Huh, nice

05:16.066 --> 05:17.359
Here is an interesting question

05:17.359 --> 05:19.987
What kind of beverage do you
offer your programmer?

05:19.987 --> 05:22.531
Oh come on

05:22.531 --> 05:24.074
He is avoiding the issue, man !

05:24.074 --> 05:27.369
He should run for president or something

05:27.369 --> 05:32.040
I'm just going to throw these at you, you know,
like they do at the zoo

05:33.542 --> 05:36.003
Hello?

05:36.253 --> 05:38.380
It's for you

05:38.380 --> 05:41.717
Hello
Milo, this is Gary Winston,

05:41.717 --> 05:43.635
I've heard great things about your work,

05:43.635 --> 05:45.929
I'm hoping you and your friend Teddy
can come up here.

05:45.929 --> 05:47.806
Hey, Larry, you still have got
my Union Jack CD

05:47.806 --> 05:48.807
No, I gave it back..

05:48.807 --> 05:51.101
Ok, I don't know who this is but
your timing really blows

05:51.101 --> 05:53.228
'cause I just saw him in a live chat

05:53.228 --> 05:56.231
Right, well, a pair of airline tickets are
on there way to you,

05:56.231 --> 06:00.986
I would love to show you
some of the things we are doing here

06:04.448 --> 06:06.116
Who was it ?

06:07.117 --> 06:08.535
Garry Winston

06:08.535 --> 06:10.579
Ha, that would be funny

06:10.579 --> 06:14.708
I just spoke to Garry Winston?

06:15.709 --> 06:18.128
I can't believe you are not going to take that ticket

06:18.128 --> 06:18.712
Give it to me!

06:18.712 --> 06:20.339
You don't want to work there, Brian

06:20.339 --> 06:23.634
They squeeze everybody out of business,
they get bigger and fatter

06:23.634 --> 06:25.344
That's why I want to work there

06:25.344 --> 06:28.805
You sure he didn't ask for my number?

06:28.805 --> 06:30.682
Milo, we can't go up there

06:30.682 --> 06:32.726
They don't even know
the meaning of open source

06:32.726 --> 06:34.645
You know this,
we have talked about this

06:34.645 --> 06:36.313
They just want to own everything

06:36.313 --> 06:38.482
They clone stuff, they reverse engineering it

06:38.482 --> 06:43.111
I, I know. / Everybody is stuck
with their inferior proprietary version

06:43.111 --> 06:45.239
They are being investigated
by the justice department for christs’ sake

06:45.239 --> 06:47.241
Tell him, Harry

06:47.241 --> 06:52.079
I think that he should go up there and
check it out if he is curious

06:53.080 --> 06:53.831
You do?

06:53.831 --> 06:57.042
Sure, I mean it's your life

06:57.835 --> 07:00.003
I need another beer

07:12.975 --> 07:16.144
So, you couldn't convince
your friend Teddy to come home

07:16.144 --> 07:20.232
No, he is pretty tight with his folks

07:20.232 --> 07:22.401
You know we can move them up here
same goes for yours

07:22.401 --> 07:24.570
My parents are dead

07:24.570 --> 07:26.530
I'm sorry man

07:26.530 --> 07:28.407
So how far is the campus?

07:28.407 --> 07:31.076
We're not going to campus.

08:08.363 --> 08:10.616
All I can say is it's unfortunate,

08:10.616 --> 08:14.286
we offered a lot of money.
A substantial amount of money, Gary, no sell

08:14.286 --> 08:18.081
Can we buy into their stock?
Or is that a justice department problem too?

08:18.081 --> 08:23.086
There is no stock, Randy
I mean there's no company

08:23.086 --> 08:25.297
Garry Winston's office
May I help you?

08:26.590 --> 08:30.594
Thanks for holding. Yes, he is in a conference
right now. Can I take a message?

08:38.602 --> 08:41.188
The cold, hard facts are
that anything is possible.

08:41.188 --> 08:44.858
Anything, anything you're just not
thinking creatively.

08:45.108 --> 08:47.402
I have every confidence that you can do that, Phil.

08:47.402 --> 08:51.698
- This is difficult one but we're gonna prevail
- Alright, alright

08:51.698 --> 08:54.076
Garry Winston's office

08:54.076 --> 08:57.287
Let me check that for you

08:57.287 --> 08:58.497
I'm sorry, I don't see anything here

08:58.497 --> 09:01.083
Milo

09:01.083 --> 09:06.797
Hi.. not every day
we have genius in the house

09:06.797 --> 09:09.591
- Want a soda pop or something?
- No, thanks

09:09.591 --> 09:11.134
Come on in

09:18.851 --> 09:20.227
Digital canvas

09:20.227 --> 09:23.021
The house knows the paintings I like,
knows my favorite music,

09:23.188 --> 09:24.523
same for anybody else
that's in the system

09:24.523 --> 09:28.110
There's a little sensor
that defects who's in the room

09:28.110 --> 09:31.071
Doesn't Bill Gates have
something like that?

09:31.071 --> 09:36.618
Bill who? ha, ha. ah,
no, no. his is primitive.

09:36.618 --> 09:40.080
So I understand you are thinking of
doing a start up

09:40.455 --> 09:42.082
Yeah.

09:42.791 --> 09:48.755
My friends and I have been planning on
doing a media delivery system for a long time

09:48.755 --> 09:53.552
It would be open source, we offer it free
to everybody, just charge for tech support.

09:53.552 --> 09:55.053
Wow, free.

09:55.053 --> 09:58.056
It's a cut-throat business we're in Milo

09:58.056 --> 10:05.647
It's just a matter of time before someone borrows
your technology, improves it and makes a billion dollars on it.

10:05.647 --> 10:09.860
What would you do with a billion dollars Milo?

10:09.860 --> 10:11.069
Mmm, I don't know

10:11.069 --> 10:12.571
I'll tell you what you could do

10:12.571 --> 10:17.868
You could take that money and put it back into
technology, education, the arts

10:17.868 --> 10:19.786
You can transform culture

10:19.786 --> 10:23.499
I founded opera companies, symphony orchestras,
museums, theatres, ..

10:23.499 --> 10:27.461
I have donated thousands of computers
to schools through out the country

10:27.461 --> 10:29.713
The question
really is,

10:29.713 --> 10:35.010
How many of the people you share discoveries with
will be outulistic?

10:35.010 --> 10:40.265
and how many will make fortunes of
your generosity?

10:42.518 --> 10:44.645
Come on in here

10:50.651 --> 10:54.029
Check this out.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.365
huh

10:56.365 --> 10:59.034
- This is the SYNAPSE satellite.
- You bet.

10:59.034 --> 11:03.038
I have 240 of these up there

11:03.747 --> 11:06.250
12 different orbital patterns,
20 satellites,

11:06.250 --> 11:08.252
mother satellite of each ring

11:08.252 --> 11:10.045
passes over us
every night at 10 o'clock

11:10.045 --> 11:14.049
to allow for station keeping,
re-programming, etc.

11:14.049 --> 11:16.885
They in turn pass the data along
to the sister satellites in their realm

11:16.885 --> 11:18.095
That's the coolest I ever seen.

11:18.095 --> 11:19.555
I'm total wrapped up in this

11:19.555 --> 11:22.766
It's like I’ve got my mission control
right here on my PC

11:22.766 --> 11:26.270
Activation codes,
IP address, flight pass..

11:26.270 --> 11:29.565
- It's the best train set ever, hum?
- You bet

11:34.361 --> 11:37.072
We've loaded a back door
to receive SYNAPSE transmissions

11:37.072 --> 11:40.367
and all of our OS software
for the past 6 years,

11:40.367 --> 11:48.333
We've developed compression schemes and
file formats that achieve connectivity, but..

11:48.333 --> 11:49.960
We have a problem

11:51.503 --> 11:53.463
You know what that problem is?

11:54.131 --> 11:58.594
Ah, your adaptors can't overcome
the band width limitation of wireless hand helds

11:58.594 --> 11:59.970
That's right

12:00.762 --> 12:04.016
Data takes too long to download
so your image get's..

12:04.016 --> 12:06.185
Image, ah, goes fuzzy

12:06.185 --> 12:07.769
- Fussy, yeah,
- Ha ha

12:12.733 --> 12:15.277
Can you get this done in time
to meet your date?

12:15.277 --> 12:16.904
With you, I can

12:22.075 --> 12:25.496
So I understand your friend Teddy is
kind of attached to his parents.

12:25.496 --> 12:27.331
It's very commendable

12:27.331 --> 12:29.333
Ah, the truth is he's ah..

12:29.333 --> 12:31.585
Milo, I know, he thinks

12:31.585 --> 12:33.212
we're cloned
too many programs

12:33.212 --> 12:36.632
an forced people to buy our inferior versions
and blah, blah, blah..

12:36.632 --> 12:38.050
add infinite item and nauseousm

12:38.050 --> 12:39.301
I've heard it all before.

12:39.301 --> 12:40.385
I even understand it,

12:40.385 --> 12:42.346
it's the nature of competitive business.

12:42.346 --> 12:43.805
When you're on top

12:43.805 --> 12:46.141
people attack the quality
of your product.

12:46.141 --> 12:48.185
It comes with the territory

12:48.185 --> 12:52.689
So when the attacks get personal
that Gary Winston is satan web sites,

12:52.689 --> 12:57.903
digitising my wife's face on porn star bodies

12:57.903 --> 13:00.239
I don't like that

13:01.114 --> 13:03.617
You're one of maybe
twenty programmers in the world

13:03.617 --> 13:06.620
with the mastery it going to
take to finish this thing

13:08.080 --> 13:11.250
We'd love for you to join us

13:11.375 --> 13:15.295
The future holds limitless possibilities, Milo

13:15.295 --> 13:18.131
You decide what the future holds for you.

13:18.131 --> 13:19.758
Let me know

13:21.844 --> 13:25.722
You know I look at you and
see something I haven't seen in 20 years

13:25.722 --> 13:28.976
- What?
- I see me!

13:42.781 --> 13:45.742
- Alice
- Umm,

13:56.795 --> 13:59.089
So when is Brian coming from the T.V?

13:59.256 --> 14:00.591
I don't know

14:04.344 --> 14:06.847
I'm going to leave you two alone, o.k?

14:17.566 --> 14:19.276
Why are you doing this?

14:19.276 --> 14:20.444
Teddy, come on

14:20.444 --> 14:22.613
He can't hit his date without you, can he?

14:23.739 --> 14:27.242
Remember that lecture Ginnings gave?
about open source

14:27.242 --> 14:28.160
Yeah

14:28.160 --> 14:30.871
He said human knowledge
belongs to the world

14:30.871 --> 14:33.040
Like Shakespeare or Asprin

14:33.040 --> 14:35.709
Teddy, I know you are disappointed,

14:35.709 --> 14:37.920
I just feel like this is the right thing
to do for now,

14:37.920 --> 14:40.797
They were interested in you too,
Gary even mentioned you

14:40.797 --> 14:43.091
Yeah, well.. I'm not interested in them

14:43.091 --> 14:44.426
That's fine.

14:44.426 --> 14:46.845
I get what's important to you

14:47.638 --> 14:49.640
This is important to me.

14:51.183 --> 14:53.852
And I know your are going to
get your venture capital

14:53.852 --> 14:55.229
We did, We had to settle for 850,

14:55.229 --> 14:57.231
because we lost you

14:57.231 --> 14:58.982
So, it will be enough.

14:58.982 --> 15:01.860
It'll be enough because they got you

15:02.945 --> 15:05.906
We're both going to do something great

15:06.156 --> 15:07.741
Sure

15:08.033 --> 15:10.285
I just thought we were
going to do it together

15:28.595 --> 15:31.682
Milo, this is Mr. Barton
from the...

15:31.682 --> 15:33.600
Department of Justice

15:33.600 --> 15:35.477
- Sorry about the glass
- No problem

15:35.477 --> 15:38.605
How are you, Milo. I am here as a friend

15:39.273 --> 15:42.359
I understand you signed up
with Gary Winston

15:42.359 --> 15:46.446
You know Milo, we're at
a great disadvantage with NURV

15:46.446 --> 15:50.367
I mean our experts are not
as smart as theirs

15:50.367 --> 15:56.665
The truth is we could do with a real smart guy
on our team to help pick our fights

15:58.250 --> 16:01.753
Ha, I’m going to take a real shot
in the dark here, O.K?

16:01.753 --> 16:05.048
I can offer you $42,000
a year and a Buick

16:05.048 --> 16:07.801
if you change your mind and join us.

16:09.219 --> 16:12.931
I'm hoping you have a feeling
that is the right thing to do

16:14.474 --> 16:17.477
Well, I’m sure what you're doing
is important, Mr. Barton

16:17.477 --> 16:21.440
I just fell like this is a...
kind of my time to make my mark

16:21.440 --> 16:24.735
Well, like I said,
it is a shot in the dark

16:24.735 --> 16:28.030
No, no, no,
please, please, keep it.

16:28.822 --> 16:32.075
If you see something up there
that rubs you the wrong way

16:32.075 --> 16:35.078
do the right thing

17:11.448 --> 17:12.657
What are they building?

17:12.657 --> 17:15.536
Oh, That's a...
Building number 21

17:15.536 --> 17:18.204
it's way behind schedule.
It's still off limits.

17:18.204 --> 17:19.998
It's our digital broadcast base.

17:19.998 --> 17:24.002
Taking forever to get the fiber optics
linked in there

17:28.173 --> 17:29.800
This is the day care center

17:29.800 --> 17:32.553
Gary has put a lot of money in there.

17:32.553 --> 17:37.391
And the people with kids are not hot shot geeks
or anything. They just payroll clerk or whatever

17:37.391 --> 17:39.852
That's cool
I know, that's really cool

17:45.065 --> 17:47.067
The card is encoded.

17:47.067 --> 17:49.945
It tells who came through the door
and when

17:49.945 --> 17:53.782
If you see a tailgater
that someone coming on your swipe, report him

17:53.782 --> 17:58.495
If you see someone wandering around without ID,
it is your duty to challenge him

17:58.495 --> 18:01.707
I don't give a shit
if you are a stock option billionaire

18:01.707 --> 18:05.002
If you don't challenge,
I'll have your butt

18:05.002 --> 18:06.461
He seems a little tense

18:06.461 --> 18:07.796
Oh, ??? , yeah, yeah

18:07.796 --> 18:09.798
He gets his chain pulled a lot
by the geeks around here

18:09.798 --> 18:12.885
because he is non-tech
Because he is a ex-cop or whatever

18:19.224 --> 18:23.353
Whoa..a, Lisa actually looked at you

18:24.188 --> 18:27.524
She has a heavy graphics background

18:27.524 --> 18:31.111
She's programming scalable user interfaces
for the SYNAPSE modules

18:31.111 --> 18:33.572
She's a smart girl

18:33.572 --> 18:35.532
Every geek has a thing for Lisa, but

18:35.532 --> 18:37.159
she won't let anyone get near her

18:37.159 --> 18:38.619
I have a girl friend

18:38.619 --> 18:39.953
What ?

18:39.953 --> 18:42.956
you got like, you got like a girl friend
A 3 dimensional girl friend

18:42.956 --> 18:45.709
That's really rare around here

18:47.878 --> 18:50.589
So, welcome to the egg

18:52.007 --> 18:53.759
Ah.., everybody listen up

18:53.759 --> 18:55.177
Can I have your attention, please

18:55.177 --> 18:58.805
This is Milo. Milo, This is everybody
Hello, Milo

19:01.975 --> 19:05.395
This is Lori, Dorren..
You'll get to know everybody, I’m sure

19:06.188 --> 19:09.650
And this is your world

19:09.650 --> 19:12.402
Your are now officially an egg man
Whew...

19:12.402 --> 19:13.987
Wheeww

19:15.948 --> 19:17.491
Ah, oh, O.K,

19:17.491 --> 19:22.287
so we got a, electronic copy of
Gary's book with complementary player, as well as

19:22.287 --> 19:26.124
an audio version narrated
by Gary of course.

19:26.124 --> 19:28.168
A.. hand held digy, cell phone, and

19:28.168 --> 19:30.420
the keys to your brand new car

19:30.420 --> 19:31.797
Guess that's it man

19:31.797 --> 19:35.175
A, your counselor will be by to fill you
in on the rest of the details

19:35.175 --> 19:36.260
You're going to love it here

19:36.260 --> 19:39.179
- Thank you and thanks for...
- My pleasure,

19:39.179 --> 19:40.597
Good luck

19:48.355 --> 19:49.898
Hey, Milo,

19:49.898 --> 19:51.275
Just a little advice,

19:51.275 --> 19:53.610
don't get to close to Stinky

19:53.610 --> 19:55.237
You're hysterical Dessy

19:55.237 --> 19:57.823
What do they do for a village idiot
when you're here?

19:57.823 --> 20:02.744
Dude, What do they do with all the air fresheners
when you're here / I don't know

20:25.475 --> 20:27.394
Busy?

20:27.394 --> 20:28.979
No,

20:29.938 --> 20:34.318
umm, I just actually waiting for my counselor
to come by and introduce himself

20:35.027 --> 20:37.863
Oh, hello Milo, I’m Gary

20:38.906 --> 20:40.240
Okay

20:40.240 --> 20:42.701
Come on let me introduce you
to the rest of the team

20:42.701 --> 20:44.828
Hey, Stinky
Oh, Hi, Gary,

20:44.828 --> 20:46.705
how's it going?

20:46.705 --> 20:48.081
Hi Gary, how's it going

20:48.081 --> 20:50.792
Dessy and Stinky are
working on compression

20:50.792 --> 20:54.421
Josh and Vancat are
writing protocol handlers

20:54.421 --> 20:55.589
This is Milo

20:55.589 --> 21:00.469
- Milo is working on the all important adaptor
- Alright, Milo

21:03.222 --> 21:06.099
When I announce the launch date
for SYNAPSE

21:06.099 --> 21:08.977
it wasn't arbitrary,

21:08.977 --> 21:12.814
but it wasn't based on
our progress either, as you know

21:12.814 --> 21:20.030
If we do not have a workable version of
SYNAPSE by then, it's over folks

21:20.030 --> 21:24.535
And this is the glib of little headline
you will be seeing through out the world

21:24.535 --> 21:25.994
-

21:25.994 --> 21:28.205
- Not gonna happen, is it?
- No

21:28.205 --> 21:29.706
- Is it?
- No

21:29.706 --> 21:34.461
Not going.. to happen

21:34.461 --> 21:37.965
There are no constraints, no boundaries

21:37.965 --> 21:39.800
Surprise me,

21:39.800 --> 21:41.760
challenge me,

21:41.760 --> 21:44.596
Defy me,

21:44.596 --> 21:46.723
Defy yourselves

21:46.723 --> 21:49.017
You have a choice.

21:49.017 --> 21:52.855
You can be forgotten,
or you can be remembered

21:52.855 --> 21:56.859
as one of the noble few
who made it

21:59.027 --> 22:02.489
Now's the time,
to go way beyond your potential

22:02.489 --> 22:05.576
Now's the time,
to dig down deep folks.

22:05.576 --> 22:09.580
Now's the time,
to show why you are the elite

22:09.580 --> 22:11.456
The chosen few.

22:11.456 --> 22:14.209
The rare lights that give
this company

22:14.209 --> 22:15.627
its uniqueness

22:15.627 --> 22:18.964
its lumineses.

22:21.341 --> 22:24.303
Now's the time to shine

22:38.442 --> 22:42.070
Corporate condo's are almost
as romantic as they sound associate

22:42.070 --> 22:45.282
She brought me here.

22:45.282 --> 22:48.577
Well, I think it's...

22:50.704 --> 22:51.622
I...

22:51.622 --> 22:53.415
What do you think?

22:53.415 --> 22:56.627
Did I tell you he has never been
anyone's counselor before?

23:04.259 --> 23:05.260
I did.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.221
I'm sorry the house is great

23:07.429 --> 23:11.934
It's great and so are you
Yeah Yeah, yeah, yeah

23:11.934 --> 23:13.727
- Really?
- Really.

23:13.727 --> 23:17.439
- Come on, I love you
- You do?

23:17.439 --> 23:24.154
Show me the bedroom

23:24.154 --> 23:28.158
most of us who write software achieve
our greatest work before 8:30

23:28.158 --> 23:31.161
As I grow older I know how important..

23:31.161 --> 23:34.122
Are you going to keep working?

23:47.970 --> 23:49.429
Oh, hi, Gary

23:51.890 --> 23:54.059
In the middle of something?

23:54.059 --> 23:56.311
- No.
- Check this out.

24:05.362 --> 24:06.697
Huh,
huh!

24:08.866 --> 24:10.117
Wow!

24:10.117 --> 24:12.786
Who did this?
A Josh or a vangetta or what..

24:12.786 --> 24:15.831
Somebody, yeah.
Think you can use it?

24:15.831 --> 24:20.085
- Yeah,
- the compression is awesome

24:20.085 --> 24:22.045
Struction is perfect

24:22.045 --> 24:23.964
Ha,ha,ha

24:23.964 --> 24:25.549
Oh, god,
oh

24:26.049 --> 24:28.427
So much fun,
love doing this

24:28.427 --> 24:33.348
the governor of Missouri has called
upon the president to declare a state of emergency.

24:33.390 --> 24:39.605
In local news,
a tragic car accident took the life of Portland area
computer software entrepreneur, William Sud..

24:39.605 --> 24:44.818
computer scientist of Messachusets Institute of technology
and a genius in his field

24:45.027 --> 24:49.031
Sud was found to have both
protract and alcohol in his car

24:49.031 --> 24:52.910
- Milo
- Hi

24:56.538 --> 24:58.540
You're pretty famous around here / Yeah,

24:59.124 --> 25:01.335
but getting a bit of a teachers pet rep.

25:01.335 --> 25:02.961
I wouldn't worry about it

25:02.961 --> 25:06.548
I mean you have to figure that most people
around here were their teachers pets

25:06.548 --> 25:08.550
- Were you?
- We moved around a lot

25:08.550 --> 25:11.470
- Barely knew my teachers
- Me too, I..

25:11.470 --> 25:14.848
- What were you?.. An army brat or something?
- Yes, something like that

25:17.184 --> 25:18.352
What do you got there?

25:18.352 --> 25:21.730
I wanted to show you
the interface systems... for SYNAPSE

25:21.730 --> 25:23.398
OK, here

25:23.398 --> 25:27.110
I'm Lisa by the way
Yeah, I know

25:28.028 --> 25:29.947
Hi, you have reached the office of Skullbox

25:29.947 --> 25:31.281
Teddy and Larry are out right now,

25:31.281 --> 25:34.952
Leave a message and we will call you back
when you are out and leave you one

25:34.952 --> 25:37.663
Hey Teddy, it's Milo

25:37.663 --> 25:41.625
Uh, just calling
because it has been a while and

25:41.625 --> 25:44.253
uh, guess I’m kinda hoping
you're not still pissed at me

25:44.253 --> 25:45.295
- Hi

25:45.337 --> 25:50.175
- Hey, how's it going?
- OK, I guess

25:50.175 --> 25:54.721
- And Larry?
- Good, yeah

25:54.721 --> 25:58.684
- So, you guys making progress?
- Sorry, that's classified information,

25:58.684 --> 26:00.561
we had to sign all those non-disclourser forms.
You know how it is

26:00.561 --> 26:03.355
Oh yeah, yeah,
me too, me too, yeah

26:03.355 --> 26:05.899
Still, work is not the only thing
to talk about is it?

26:05.899 --> 26:07.734
Oh, of course not

26:09.611 --> 26:11.780
So, what's you been up too?

26:11.780 --> 26:13.157
Working

26:17.619 --> 26:19.413
It's good to hear from you

26:19.413 --> 26:22.291
Even though you are the enemy now

26:25.169 --> 26:27.087
Gary Winston's office, can you hold please, thank you

26:27.087 --> 26:29.423
Thank you so much for holding,

26:29.423 --> 26:32.551
How may I help you?
Let me just check that for you

26:33.594 --> 26:38.223
The Department of Justice says that if we acquire
net mail they will view it as anti-competitive

26:38.223 --> 26:42.311
Well, why didn't you tell me this
before we decided to forego R and D..

26:42.311 --> 26:45.230
Well, at the time, they indicated
that it wouldn't be a problem

26:45.230 --> 26:46.982
But they have a bureaucratic
mind set, Gary they..

26:47.024 --> 26:48.400
They do?

26:48.400 --> 26:50.736
I count on you
to solve problems, whatever it takes

26:50.736 --> 26:52.321
show me some creativity

26:52.321 --> 26:53.655
Gary, we're talking about the law

26:53.655 --> 26:55.199
It's not like making software,

26:55.199 --> 26:56.325
There are limits

26:56.325 --> 26:58.785
--;

26:58.785 --> 27:00.078
No limits!

27:00.954 --> 27:02.456
Stop thinking like a lawyer for a second

27:02.664 --> 27:06.627
and show me some kind of creativity

27:07.336 --> 27:08.587
Yes, Sir.

27:16.887 --> 27:18.222
He'll have to get back to you

27:18.222 --> 27:20.432
Gary Winston's office

27:20.432 --> 27:22.684
You can go on in, Milo

27:23.685 --> 27:27.147
Gary Winston's office.
Yes, he is in a conference right now,

27:27.147 --> 27:28.023
May I take a message?

27:28.023 --> 27:29.441
Gary

27:29.441 --> 27:34.071
- You wanted to see me?
- Yeah,

27:37.741 --> 27:43.455
Take a look

27:49.169 --> 27:51.421
This is amazing.
Who's doing all this?

27:51.421 --> 27:53.340
What does that mean?

27:53.924 --> 27:56.802
- What does that mean, huh?
- Nothing, I, I...

28:04.601 --> 28:06.186
I'm sorry

28:06.186 --> 28:08.230
that wasn't meant for you

28:09.815 --> 28:12.860
Justice Department is driving me nuts

28:12.860 --> 28:15.904
They make everything strategic I do,
look sorted

28:15.904 --> 28:20.325
Every good chess player knows his
opponents moves before he makes them

28:20.325 --> 28:22.202
Everyone in business tries to get ahead

28:22.202 --> 28:24.621
I get there first,
I’m a bad guy

28:24.621 --> 28:26.415
What are we doing here?

28:26.415 --> 28:28.208
Are we making chemical weapons?

28:28.208 --> 28:29.710
Kiddy porn?

28:29.710 --> 28:32.171
Are we strip mining?
No!

28:33.463 --> 28:36.341
Why are they after me?

28:38.552 --> 28:42.514
The software business
is binary

28:42.764 --> 28:47.144
you're a one or a zero,
alive or dead

28:52.858 --> 28:56.445
- It scares, don't you think?
- Definitely, yeah

29:02.659 --> 29:04.495
It’s your copy

29:15.714 --> 29:18.800
I don't want to speak too soon,

29:18.800 --> 29:21.803
but I think I cracked it, Larry

29:25.432 --> 29:28.727
I really think I cracked it

29:29.311 --> 29:30.896
Huh

29:45.410 --> 29:47.871
Are you going to tell me
what's bothering you are not?

29:47.871 --> 29:49.456
- Ok
- Ok.

29:50.833 --> 29:53.335
Gary gave me a
new compression scheme today

29:53.335 --> 29:55.671
I said " Who's doing all this ",

29:55.671 --> 29:57.673
cause I was impressed
I wanted to know where

29:57.673 --> 29:59.466
it was coming from
Right ?

29:59.466 --> 30:03.470
He just lost it, like...
he was, he shouted at me,

30:03.554 --> 30:07.683
he had this look in his eyes, like..

30:07.683 --> 30:10.227
How horrible!
Yeah

30:11.144 --> 30:13.564
- But where did it come from?
- I don't know

30:13.564 --> 30:15.983
That's what I’ve been asking myself

30:15.983 --> 30:19.903
I asked around. Nobody knows
anything about it, uh.

30:19.903 --> 30:23.407
You know, so does he have
some genius stored away somewhere?

30:23.407 --> 30:26.785
And if does, why not
let him write SYNAPSE?

30:26.785 --> 30:30.497
- I not saying if makes any sense...
- Hey! Honey

30:30.497 --> 30:34.293
Sesame Seeds.
Jesus.

30:34.293 --> 30:38.380
Excuse me...
Could you take that away, thank you

30:38.380 --> 30:41.341
- I'm so stupid
- Hey!

30:43.302 --> 30:45.596
He is a genius. Don't forget.

30:45.596 --> 30:50.309
If anybody other than you could
write this thing as quickly as you're saying

30:50.392 --> 30:53.770
wouldn't it maybe be him?
- Yes, yes, you are right,

30:53.770 --> 30:56.773
The guy's a genius,
SYNAPSE is all he cares about

30:56.773 --> 31:00.819
and I’m being over sensitive for a change

31:00.819 --> 31:02.988
To geniuses

31:16.919 --> 31:18.921
You know what?

31:18.921 --> 31:23.133
Sometimes it helps to get out of here.
Just for an hour or so.

31:26.637 --> 31:28.347
Hey, Milo

31:28.722 --> 31:30.224
Brain

31:31.600 --> 31:34.228
Just dropped off my resume,
Nearly got in the door.

31:34.228 --> 31:35.771
You're living up here now?

31:35.771 --> 31:39.024
I'm systems administrator
at the load public access station,

31:39.024 --> 31:42.653
Where any whack Job
with 100 bucks gets his own show.

31:43.195 --> 31:45.656
God is it suck.

31:47.407 --> 31:49.284
Can you help me?

31:49.284 --> 31:52.746
- Put it the word
- I'll see what I can do. Yeah

31:56.416 --> 31:59.586
- Well, I’m parked illegally
- Ok.

32:03.423 --> 32:06.426
They pushed up all the schedules
on the SYNAPSE's applications

32:06.426 --> 32:08.136
How fast you go?

32:08.136 --> 32:10.097
There is no second place.

32:10.097 --> 32:14.351
Plus every time I get jammed up.
Gary comes up with something.

32:14.351 --> 32:18.188
Did uh... Gary give you a new design
or something? - Yeah

32:18.188 --> 32:21.108
I must have offended him,
'cause he a...

32:21.108 --> 32:24.111
he yelled at me.

32:24.111 --> 32:28.365
People don't ever just,
like, hand you stuff

32:28.365 --> 32:32.703
Maybe once.
I reconfigured it anyway.

32:32.703 --> 32:34.621
You're compulsive.

33:13.785 --> 33:15.746
Moments,

33:15.787 --> 33:17.414
precious moments
that you want to hold

33:17.414 --> 33:18.957
that you want to share,

33:18.957 --> 33:21.210
at home, at school, at work.

33:21.210 --> 33:25.047
You'll keep in touch with the one's
you love through SYNAPSE

33:25.047 --> 33:28.258
the first satellite delivered
global communications system

33:28.258 --> 33:34.264
Share live voices, music, pictures
or video, data or text,

33:34.264 --> 33:36.934
with anyone, anywhere, instantly...

33:36.934 --> 33:39.186
Look, Daddy

33:40.020 --> 33:43.565
SYNAPSE links every
communication device on the planet.

33:43.565 --> 33:46.276
Because every moment matters.

33:53.742 --> 33:56.078
I think you do

33:56.078 --> 34:00.958
- Hi, honey
- Hi

34:00.958 --> 34:02.876
I didn't expect ..ah..

34:06.004 --> 34:09.091
Uh.. Lisa this is my...
this is Alice..

34:09.091 --> 34:14.137
Lisa is doing the user interfaces
for SYNAPSE. - Oh

34:14.137 --> 34:16.681
Hi

34:16.681 --> 34:20.101
Milo tells me
you are a really great artist

34:20.101 --> 34:24.773
Oh, yeah he always exaggerates.

34:26.567 --> 34:32.322
Well um, I got a lot to do..
it was nice to meet you.

34:36.659 --> 34:38.871
How are you?
I'm so surprised

34:38.871 --> 34:41.998
- Are you ok? Is everything alright?
- Yeah yeah.

34:41.998 --> 34:46.128
No. I just wanted to come out
and you know. ..see what these faces like.

34:46.210 --> 34:48.630
- It's really good to see you.
- Yeah.

34:53.760 --> 34:55.053
What did the girl say?

34:55.053 --> 34:58.098
There maybe a little less trust
after you snapped at him

34:58.098 --> 35:02.769
- It hasn't effected his work though.
- Nothing does.

35:02.769 --> 35:04.646
It's pretty amazing.

35:18.535 --> 35:19.661
What's wrong?

35:19.661 --> 35:22.122
Teddy's been killed.

36:13.549 --> 36:14.800
They've done this before.

36:14.800 --> 36:17.970
Just never killed anybody until now.

36:17.970 --> 36:20.430
But it's their writing
on the wall

36:20.430 --> 36:24.226
Their hate literature
was scattered everywhere

36:24.226 --> 36:28.689
They hold MO, it's like they were
asking to be caught.

36:28.689 --> 36:31.191
And they've been arrested twice
for beating up Asians.

36:31.191 --> 36:33.110
How come they weren't in jail?

36:33.110 --> 36:36.446
People told us to be careful
in this neighborhood.

36:36.446 --> 36:38.782
I guess he didn't take them
too seriously.

36:38.782 --> 36:41.869
Yeah. well.
that's our problem.

36:41.869 --> 36:45.372
We don't take anything seriously, do we?

36:45.372 --> 36:47.541
It's not on the hard drive.

37:07.352 --> 37:11.607
Hey, I didn't know you guys
were working with fiber optics.

37:30.083 --> 37:32.878
We're just a bounch of crazy assholes.

37:34.296 --> 37:39.218
And he was on the verge of something.
He was right there.

37:39.218 --> 37:41.678
He was going to show us the next day.

37:41.720 --> 37:45.265
He told me, I should get the VC to line up
appointment with a bunch of companies.

37:45.265 --> 37:47.017
You know.

37:47.017 --> 37:52.773
He said, the answer is not in the box.
It's in the band.

37:54.316 --> 37:59.947
- You know I called him last week to uh...
'cause... - I know.

37:59.947 --> 38:03.617
He was happy you did.

38:07.412 --> 38:08.705
Be strong, Larry

38:12.292 --> 38:13.836
Milo.

38:15.504 --> 38:18.674
- May I join you?
- Yeah

38:23.387 --> 38:25.806
Heard about what happened.

38:26.807 --> 38:29.434
- I'm very sorry.
- Thanks

38:29.434 --> 38:32.855
Had you talked to him... much, lately?

38:32.855 --> 38:34.773
Just once.

38:34.773 --> 38:38.902
Things weren't that great between us
and we couldn't talk about work

38:38.944 --> 38:40.821
because it was off limits.

38:43.115 --> 38:45.200
Did you have something
you wanted to show me?

38:45.242 --> 38:48.495
- Look. we can save it for another day.
- No, it's okay. I..

38:48.495 --> 38:50.706
it will help take my mind off things.

38:50.706 --> 38:51.123
Really

38:51.123 --> 38:53.500
- Yeah. yeah
- Okay.

38:55.961 --> 38:58.589
Well, I haven't been able to sleep all week.

38:58.589 --> 39:03.886
Thinking about the push mechanism in the handler.
And then it just came to me.

39:03.886 --> 39:05.637
It's in the wrong place.

39:05.637 --> 39:09.099
- The wrong place.
- Yeah

39:09.099 --> 39:15.063
The answer is not in the box.
It's in the band.

39:15.063 --> 39:18.108
It's in the band.
It's in the band.

39:49.932 --> 39:52.184
Hey, are you sure you're alright?

39:52.184 --> 39:54.728
I think I ate something,
I gotta go.

40:14.706 --> 40:16.083
Alice!

40:31.682 --> 40:33.600
Teddy was on to something
very specific,

40:33.600 --> 40:36.186
now he is dead. There's got to be
a connection, Alice, I can feel it.

40:36.228 --> 40:37.145
So what are you saying?

40:37.145 --> 40:39.189
You think they have something
to do with Teddy's death

40:39.231 --> 40:39.940
I don't know what I am saying,

40:39.982 --> 40:41.775
all I know is
all these ideas keep flying in.

40:41.775 --> 40:43.986
He says that any kid working in his garage
could put him out of business,

40:43.986 --> 40:46.196
It's almost like they know
what every kid is doing.

40:46.196 --> 40:47.990
They're hacking into people's computers.

40:47.990 --> 40:50.951
I guess they can get into some people's
machines, but, not ..not Teddys.

40:50.993 --> 40:54.163
He always had the most paranoid
firewalls to protect his data.

40:54.204 --> 40:57.875
They'd have to been like
watching him physically

40:58.709 --> 41:00.460
Watching him physically.

41:01.003 --> 41:02.337
Oh shit

41:13.307 --> 41:15.642
I think it is part of a camera

41:15.934 --> 41:18.228
Number 21 isn't just a broadcast studio.

41:18.228 --> 41:21.023
It's a surveillance post or something.
That's why they have those disks on the roof.

41:21.023 --> 41:22.816
Milo, think about that you're saying,

41:22.816 --> 41:24.610
You honestly think that
he would murder somebody?

41:24.610 --> 41:25.986
I don't know,
I gotta get in there

41:25.986 --> 41:28.071
There's over 20 buildings over there,
and they all filled with computers

41:28.071 --> 41:29.781
No no no, this is the only one
with disks on the roof

41:29.823 --> 41:30.991
The studios a front,

41:30.991 --> 41:32.326
That's why they keep
postponing the opening.

41:32.326 --> 41:34.453
Ok, now you're scaring me.

41:34.453 --> 41:35.662
Do you wanna just go?

41:35.662 --> 41:38.123
'Cause we can go,
you wanna just... leave

41:38.123 --> 41:40.542
Go where, go where Alice?
You can't get away from people like this!

41:40.584 --> 41:42.419
People like this.
This is Gary you are talking about

41:42.461 --> 41:44.379
You don't think I know that?

41:45.923 --> 41:48.050
They're under investigation
by the Justice Department

41:48.050 --> 41:50.802
I mean, you said yourself that
there are guys showing up all the time.

41:50.802 --> 41:54.056
Then how could they possibly hope
on hiding a surveillance force,

41:54.056 --> 41:57.059
How could they hope on hiding anything,
You can't get in there anyway,

41:57.059 --> 42:00.187
they have swipe cards, they have cameras,
I mean it's like Fort Knox for christ sakes

42:00.187 --> 42:02.105
I'm implicated, I’m implicated Alice
No, you're not - Yes, I am.

42:02.105 --> 42:03.815
- No, you're not
- No

42:03.815 --> 42:05.400
Yes, who's been using this code, huh?

42:05.400 --> 42:07.361
Teddy's code.
Whoever code this is. I have,

42:07.361 --> 42:09.488
how do you think that makes me feel?
This is my best friend,

42:09.488 --> 42:10.614
You need to calm down, now

42:10.614 --> 42:13.575
- I can't just walk away from this
- Yeah, but you can't just walk in either.

42:19.289 --> 42:21.583
- You're right
- Yeah

42:21.583 --> 42:24.211
You're right

42:24.211 --> 42:26.672
Uh.. the construction is
finished by 6 or 7,

42:26.672 --> 42:29.049
the parking lot is cleared
by 2 or 3 in the morning.

42:29.049 --> 42:30.884
Even the earliest geeks don't get is till 5.

42:30.884 --> 42:32.052
Honey, what are you talking about?

42:32.052 --> 42:33.387
What, what are you saying right now?

42:33.387 --> 42:34.638
Listen to me, I thinking about

42:34.638 --> 42:36.640
how I gotta get in there
and find out what the hell is going on.

42:36.640 --> 42:38.016
Okay but was it true or was it true,

42:38.016 --> 42:41.228
did you ever really notice,
you're just sounding like a mad man.

42:41.228 --> 42:42.688
I won't pretend like
everything is okay, Alice

42:42.688 --> 42:44.982
that's how I got into this mess

42:47.234 --> 42:48.986
I, just tell like..

42:48.986 --> 42:50.195
Alice listen, listen,

42:50.195 --> 42:53.782
I'm not, I don't mean to,
I’m not mad at you, listen to me,

42:53.782 --> 42:56.326
I think I can figure out
a way to get in there.

42:56.326 --> 42:59.538
But I can't do it on my own,
so I need you to help me.

43:02.583 --> 43:05.085
What am I to do ?

43:05.794 --> 43:07.921
So you believe me?

43:08.255 --> 43:10.591
Just tell me what to do.

43:51.298 --> 43:55.677
Whoa, whoa , whoa, Whoa, Sir,
you got to use your own. Where's your ID?

43:59.056 --> 44:02.017
I caught him tailgating. Building 20.

44:13.403 --> 44:16.448
These cards are your own responsibility

44:29.419 --> 44:33.549
- There was an explosion in the closet
in buiding 12
- What?

44:35.300 --> 44:40.013
Hey, you can't wander around without ID,
just park your ass in that chair

46:35.587 --> 46:38.173
Well, what can I tell ya ?
It's pretty basic operation guide

46:38.173 --> 46:42.177
You got your time clock, fuse goes in here
you just hook it in the switch over here

46:42.177 --> 46:43.303
So, what we got here Bob?

46:43.303 --> 46:46.306
Some glorified cherry bomb,
some geeks' idea of fun.

46:46.306 --> 46:48.225
I've been saying
we need a camera in this hall

46:48.225 --> 46:50.727
To protect what,
the mops?

46:50.727 --> 46:52.312
somebody is pulling the chain again Bob.

46:52.312 --> 46:55.107
Unless it's a diversion,
Milo Hoffman is in my office.

46:55.107 --> 46:58.861
- He was tailgating
- Bob. Milo is not just another geek

46:58.861 --> 47:02.781
He is very important to Gary,
So let's not go there, all right?

47:03.949 --> 47:06.034
Okay, we'll see you later

47:52.748 --> 47:55.292
Is everything okay, Bob?

48:11.016 --> 48:13.310
- Hey!

48:13.519 --> 48:15.103
- Hi Gary

48:15.103 --> 48:18.857
- Working kinda late, huh?
- Yeah , uh..

48:18.857 --> 48:22.945
- Can I take a look ?
- Yeah

48:25.447 --> 48:29.868
- Oh, that’s nice. That's excellent.
- Thanks.

48:29.868 --> 48:32.287
You seem kinda jumpy, Milo.

48:32.287 --> 48:37.543
No. I'm just a.... I'm a little surprised
to see you out here, now.

48:37.543 --> 48:43.048
Well, I like to sneak in late at night sometimes
to see who the obsessive ones are

48:46.593 --> 48:49.012
Don't work too late.

48:49.680 --> 48:52.140
I got my eye on you

49:44.985 --> 49:47.488
- How's it going?
- Big night

49:47.488 --> 49:50.324
switched from tea to coffee.

49:50.324 --> 49:52.534
Brought new meaning to my work.

51:25.919 --> 51:30.007
Well, now he knows.
Nothing in there.

51:30.007 --> 51:33.677
- Maybe he'll get back to work now.
- Yeah, copy that.

51:33.677 --> 51:36.930
- Speaking of which.
- Okay. I'm on my way back.

54:48.121 --> 54:52.084
- Did you download code San Jose.
- Oh shit.

54:52.084 --> 54:53.335
I'll do it.

54:54.878 --> 54:58.382
- Shame we can't just walk in the front door.
- Yeah, wouldn't Bob love that.

59:20.477 --> 59:21.478
Ooh!

59:25.482 --> 59:26.984
Jesus

01:01:53.672 --> 01:01:55.674
Yes, I gonna need a thorough background check.

01:01:55.674 --> 01:01:57.467
I want to know every organization

01:01:57.467 --> 01:02:00.179
he's been involved with, church groups, all..

01:02:00.179 --> 01:02:01.847
- Ahh, Mr. Barton?
- Yes

01:02:01.847 --> 01:02:04.057
Excuse me, uh..

01:02:04.057 --> 01:02:05.893
do you remember me?

01:02:05.893 --> 01:02:06.894
Meelo, isn't it?

01:02:06.894 --> 01:02:08.312
- Milo
- Milo

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.522
I really need to talk to you Sir, like..

01:02:10.522 --> 01:02:13.275
Right, uh.. give me a few seconds
with Lasy here

01:02:13.275 --> 01:02:14.276
you can go into my office

01:02:14.276 --> 01:02:16.945
I won't be late but a moment

01:02:43.388 --> 01:02:44.389
- Milo

01:02:44.389 --> 01:02:47.518
Hey! uh.. Yeah!

01:02:47.559 --> 01:02:49.186
Thank you for seeing me, Sir

01:02:49.269 --> 01:02:53.774
- No problem, have a seat
- I’m ok.

01:02:54.608 --> 01:02:56.276
You look a little upset

01:02:56.360 --> 01:02:58.779
I am Sir, I am

01:02:59.279 --> 01:03:02.324
What's the problem, son

01:03:02.533 --> 01:03:04.618
Ah..well,

01:03:04.618 --> 01:03:08.664
my friend, my best friend Teddy

01:03:08.664 --> 01:03:12.292
He was killed in Silicon Valley and I..I thought

01:03:12.292 --> 01:03:14.962
maybe there is some way
l could help find the suspects

01:03:14.962 --> 01:03:17.297
- You mean Teddy Chan
- Yes, Sir

01:03:17.297 --> 01:03:21.677
Well, I guess you didn't see
the 11 o’clock news last night

01:03:21.677 --> 01:03:25.514
San Jose police picked up a suspect
and they're holding them without bail

01:03:25.514 --> 01:03:28.475
That's great.

01:03:28.475 --> 01:03:34.982
That's um.. I hope I'll sleep better tonight

01:03:34.982 --> 01:03:41.947
Well um, I’m a little disappointed
I thought that you decided to join our side.

01:03:41.947 --> 01:03:49.580
No Sir, no, I’m a real happy there at NURV.
but um..

01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:52.541
Thank you
and thank you for your time.

01:03:53.917 --> 01:03:57.921
- So he didn't mention he was going to
the Justice Department? - No

01:03:57.921 --> 01:03:59.715
You're not losing your hold on him,
are you, Rebecca?

01:03:59.715 --> 01:04:01.341
Don't forget your part of the deal.

01:04:01.341 --> 01:04:02.968
You got a very good thing going here.

01:04:02.968 --> 01:04:05.053
Phill, he'll tell me
when he gets back.

01:04:05.053 --> 01:04:07.598
Well, that will be the test,
won't it?

01:04:09.057 --> 01:04:10.100
Prick

01:04:24.531 --> 01:04:29.244
It's l0 o’clock,
I’ve been so worried about you

01:04:29.244 --> 01:04:30.704
What did you see in there?

01:04:30.704 --> 01:04:34.291
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

01:04:34.458 --> 01:04:36.627
It's exactly what they said it is,

01:04:36.627 --> 01:04:38.629
an unfinished broadcast studio

01:04:42.591 --> 01:04:45.552
You know, I think I’ve been
putting my own guilt on Gary

01:04:45.552 --> 01:04:47.262
Guilt?

01:04:47.262 --> 01:04:51.266
Yeah. If I’ve done the start up,
Maybe Teddy would still be alive.

01:04:51.266 --> 01:04:54.478
Or maybe you would be dead, too.

01:04:54.478 --> 01:04:58.023
Anyway, I figure instead of evolving
all these paranoid delusions

01:04:58.023 --> 01:05:02.194
and scaring you
I should do something useful with my grief.

01:05:02.444 --> 01:05:07.908
So I went to see that guy Barton at the DOJ.
Do you remember him?

01:05:07.908 --> 01:05:09.201
Yeah

01:05:09.201 --> 01:05:11.537
I wanted to see if I could help him
find Teddy's killers

01:05:11.537 --> 01:05:15.374
and it turns out they got
the guys last night so..

01:05:16.583 --> 01:05:19.920
I have been so worried about you

01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:22.172
You were right
to let him break into 21

01:05:22.172 --> 01:05:24.633
He felt pretty foolish afterwards

01:05:24.633 --> 01:05:28.011
He said it was all to do
with his own guilt you know.

01:05:28.011 --> 01:05:30.973
Not being there.
No doing the start up

01:05:30.973 --> 01:05:32.933
I mean his best friend was just killed.

01:05:32.933 --> 01:05:36.937
You're convinced he is completely focused
on SYNAPSE again.

01:05:36.937 --> 01:05:39.314
- He's not acting?
- No

01:05:39.314 --> 01:05:42.025
he is pretty honest with his feelings

01:05:42.025 --> 01:05:47.072
I don't think he knows how to act.
Alright?

01:05:47.072 --> 01:05:48.991
Good.
That's all for now.

01:05:48.991 --> 01:05:50.826
Lisa, I had to tell someone.

01:05:50.868 --> 01:05:52.619
They know everything
about everybody.

01:05:52.619 --> 01:05:54.830
There're stealing code
from all over the place.

01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:57.624
And sometimes, if someone gets ahead
of them, like Teddy

01:05:57.624 --> 01:05:59.251
- It's all undetectable.
- What?

01:05:59.251 --> 01:06:02.337
The crimes are hand tailored.
These guys are in the information business.

01:06:02.337 --> 01:06:04.798
It's a Chinese guy, frame a local racist.

01:06:04.798 --> 01:06:07.593
Plus, I’m sure
Gary has maximum deniability.

01:06:07.593 --> 01:06:08.969
He tells his people,

01:06:08.969 --> 01:06:10.721
surprise me, solve the problem,
defy me,

01:06:10.721 --> 01:06:12.431
they turn around and tell the next
person the same things.

01:06:12.431 --> 01:06:15.309
That sounds crazy why would he
put himself on the line like that?

01:06:15.350 --> 01:06:15.893
SYNAPSE
SYNAPSE

01:06:15.893 --> 01:06:16.560
SYNAPSE
SYNAPSE

01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.103
the guy has invested billions
on getting there first.

01:06:18.103 --> 01:06:20.731
He will do anything to get his date
He has to....

01:06:20.731 --> 01:06:25.944
Lisa, they killed my best friend

01:06:25.944 --> 01:06:27.112
Maybe others

01:06:27.112 --> 01:06:29.406
I'm living with someone
they pay to sleep with me

01:06:29.406 --> 01:06:32.701
- we have to do something
- Like what, what could we possibly do

01:06:32.701 --> 01:06:34.828
I don't know yet. But we
are one step ahead of them

01:06:34.828 --> 01:06:37.206
they don't know I’ve been in the
Daycare center, Just 21.

01:06:37.206 --> 01:06:41.084
They let me do that.
That's all they know though.

01:06:44.588 --> 01:06:45.631
Lisa

01:06:49.384 --> 01:06:50.302
Lisa!

01:06:50.302 --> 01:06:52.679
I'm sorry, Milo

01:06:52.679 --> 01:06:54.932
Alright? I'm sorry

01:07:05.067 --> 01:07:08.237
Lisa, I know why
you won't let anyone near you.

01:07:17.913 --> 01:07:19.915
I know what he did to you

01:07:26.171 --> 01:07:28.966
If you leave now,
you could be in danger

01:07:29.883 --> 01:07:31.802
They would use my step father

01:07:31.802 --> 01:07:34.388
They could frame him
if they had too, yeah.

01:07:45.983 --> 01:07:47.234
What about the FBI?

01:07:47.234 --> 01:07:48.777
Too risky

01:07:48.777 --> 01:07:52.948
I went to the DOJ, but they got a guy
on payroll over there, maybe others.

01:07:52.948 --> 01:07:56.160
Who knows who there're paying?

01:07:56.160 --> 01:07:57.786
Well, who can we trust?

01:07:57.786 --> 01:08:00.956
I mean how do you let go of a secret
without telling the wrong person?

01:08:00.956 --> 01:08:02.291
I don't know

01:08:06.712 --> 01:08:08.797
We tell everybody at once

01:08:08.797 --> 01:08:10.883
See, that way there is no secret
left to protect.

01:08:10.883 --> 01:08:13.427
If everybody knows,
they can't touch us.

01:08:13.427 --> 01:08:14.720
Right

01:08:19.099 --> 01:08:20.767
What about 60 minutes?

01:08:25.898 --> 01:08:28.066
CBS news is partnered
with NURV information system

01:08:28.066 --> 01:08:32.946
in a cable news network
due to launch Fall of June,2001

01:08:33.488 --> 01:08:39.786
AOL-Time Warner has a 40% stake in
Gary's setup device and it also takes out CNN..

01:08:39.786 --> 01:08:43.207
Disney Join NURV's adventure
ABC is out

01:08:43.207 --> 01:08:46.919
Look, any of these places
could a more or all of them

01:08:49.546 --> 01:08:51.215
- Wait
- What?

01:08:51.215 --> 01:08:53.966
How close are you to finishing SYNAPSE?

01:08:53.966 --> 01:08:55.761
He's got all the satellites up.

01:08:55.761 --> 01:09:01.390
There's dishes on top of 21.
He's building this mega network just for SYNAPSE.

01:09:01.390 --> 01:09:04.520
We can connect to everybody
on every device simultaneously.

01:09:04.520 --> 01:09:07.147
That's what SYNAPSE is

01:09:08.023 --> 01:09:11.068
That's what we'll use ...

01:09:11.068 --> 01:09:11.984
Got him.

01:09:17.282 --> 01:09:21.203
So what's in the Daycare Center is
a top of raw material that's all over the place

01:09:21.203 --> 01:09:23.913
What I need you to do is
design some kind of a graphic format

01:09:23.913 --> 01:09:26.457
so people could follow
what there're seeing

01:09:26.457 --> 01:09:27.167
No problem

01:09:27.167 --> 01:09:30.127
- Shit
- What?

01:09:30.127 --> 01:09:32.798
I would have to get into Gary's house
to get the satellite address.

01:09:32.798 --> 01:09:35.591
He's running the whole thing
from his work phone.

01:09:35.591 --> 01:09:36.844
You mean break in?

01:09:36.844 --> 01:09:38.595
I don't know,
I don't know...

01:09:38.595 --> 01:09:41.098
And what if the dishes
on top of 21 aren't hot yet

01:09:41.098 --> 01:09:43.392
the place isn't even finished.

01:09:44.017 --> 01:09:46.645
I'll go up

01:09:46.645 --> 01:09:48.020
You're not afraid?

01:09:58.073 --> 01:10:00.534
testing.. UPLINK ACTIVE..

01:10:00.534 --> 01:10:02.369
Welcome back to Good morning Portland

01:10:02.369 --> 01:10:06.248
This Thursday, 50 of Portland's
elite couples will attend

01:10:06.248 --> 01:10:09.168
a gala party at the home of
Gary Clarisa Winston

01:10:09.168 --> 01:10:11.587
to raise money
for the Portland Art museum.

01:10:11.587 --> 01:10:13.422
Julie is at the museum.

01:10:13.422 --> 01:10:17.050
Last year party's goers pledged over
2 million dollars for this museum.

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:18.969
- Look at this
- What?

01:10:18.969 --> 01:10:22.639
Why doesn’t he invite us to his party
He's never even met you.

01:10:22.639 --> 01:10:24.725
Milo, he has thousands of employees

01:10:24.725 --> 01:10:25.767
I know Alice

01:10:25.767 --> 01:10:28.312
But this is for the art
museum and you're an artist.

01:10:28.312 --> 01:10:30.898
- If anybody should be invited, you should
- Ah, hum

01:10:34.151 --> 01:10:36.528
This is not at line feed.

01:10:36.528 --> 01:10:40.115
This is play back from some other day
It's been messed with

01:10:40.115 --> 01:10:43.118
- We call Randy and Phil?
- Not yet.

01:10:43.118 --> 01:10:47.331
I'll have to bust my ass
because I’m not a frementra

01:10:47.331 --> 01:10:51.084
I swear to god it's that kid Milo

01:10:51.084 --> 01:10:54.588
Let's run a check on card entries.
Go back two weeks.

01:10:58.217 --> 01:11:00.093
Skull Box, Larry speaking

01:11:00.093 --> 01:11:02.012
Hey Larry, it's Milo

01:11:02.012 --> 01:11:02.971
Hey buddy

01:11:02.971 --> 01:11:07.184
- How's it going
- a... I'm good.

01:11:07.184 --> 01:11:08.936
I'm ah.., back in the garage

01:11:08.936 --> 01:11:12.022
Didn't want to stay at that other place

01:11:12.022 --> 01:11:13.565
what's up?

01:11:15.776 --> 01:11:17.861
Milo?

01:11:17.861 --> 01:11:20.614
you there?

01:11:20.614 --> 01:11:22.533
Larry, you got a second.

01:11:22.533 --> 01:11:24.868
I might your help with something

01:11:24.868 --> 01:11:27.079
You bet man, name it.

01:11:33.460 --> 01:11:35.587
Milo

01:11:35.170 --> 01:11:37.714
Giving a benefit for the
art museum Thursday night and

01:11:37.714 --> 01:11:39.716
I thought you might like to bring Alice.

01:11:39.716 --> 01:11:41.802
That's great. Thank you.

01:11:41.802 --> 01:11:43.846
Sorry about the late notice.

01:12:08.704 --> 01:12:11.331
You went into 21 twice
without coming out.

01:12:11.331 --> 01:12:13.375
You came out twice
without going back in

01:12:13.375 --> 01:12:16.003
who are you, Harry Hudinny?

01:12:16.003 --> 01:12:18.380
No, No, No, this things is screwed up.
Look

01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:20.465
it also got me going
into daycare that night.

01:12:20.465 --> 01:12:22.301
Daycare center is not in your tour

01:12:22.301 --> 01:12:24.344
Exactly, I’ve never been in there

01:12:28.015 --> 01:12:31.310
Milo, we're late.
I'm coming I ah.., just gotta ah..

01:12:31.310 --> 01:12:33.562
find some scissors for this um...

01:14:08.407 --> 01:14:13.036
They call the house. They ask if you..

01:14:23.547 --> 01:14:25.924
- Alice, I’m Gary
- Hi

01:14:25.924 --> 01:14:26.884
This is my wife Clarisa.

01:14:26.884 --> 01:14:29.094
Alice, hello

01:14:29.094 --> 01:14:31.263
- Gary tells me you are an artist.
- Yes I am.

01:14:31.263 --> 01:14:34.558
Milo, this is Barry Linden.
He's visiting us from Hollywood.

01:14:34.558 --> 01:14:38.896
- Barry's studio is going to help us fill the SYNAPE pipeline
- Oh, good

01:14:38.896 --> 01:14:41.398
Marketing implication epic.

01:14:41.398 --> 01:14:43.150
Kids are watching a movie

01:14:43.150 --> 01:14:45.569
points and clicks
at the laser blaster

01:14:45.569 --> 01:14:48.906
and before the real is even over,

01:14:48.906 --> 01:14:53.869
he's bought the toy... to hell with story,
how many toys can you sell

01:14:53.869 --> 01:14:56.580
what about the arts?

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:59.208
The only art left in America
is business.

01:14:59.208 --> 01:15:01.919
And you are standing
in the venchee's house

01:15:01.919 --> 01:15:03.670
Excuse me, where is the bathroom?

01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:05.547
It's just around the corner
- Thank you

01:17:40.410 --> 01:17:42.830
You left the party to work?

01:17:42.830 --> 01:17:46.250
I got inspired

01:17:46.250 --> 01:17:50.712
I, I didn't want to forget it,
so I came here to write it down

01:17:50.712 --> 01:17:53.006
I'm sorry if I was rude.

01:18:01.348 --> 01:18:06.103
I know what you're doing

01:18:06.103 --> 01:18:10.107
I just want to know that it
is not affecting your work

01:18:10.107 --> 01:18:12.401
I don't know what you men

01:18:12.401 --> 01:18:15.154
Milo, I’m not blind

01:18:15.154 --> 01:18:17.948
Lisa is very attractive young woman.

01:18:17.948 --> 01:18:19.658
God knows and

01:18:19.658 --> 01:18:22.202
your private life is your own.

01:18:22.202 --> 01:18:24.830
But we are very close
to our launch date.

01:18:24.830 --> 01:18:28.333
and I need you to keep
your eye on the ball.

01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:32.004
- I understand Gary
- Good

01:18:32.004 --> 01:18:34.715
Let's go have a drink

01:18:44.641 --> 01:18:46.894
Hit the back slash, hit the colon.

01:18:46.894 --> 01:18:49.897
Keys kids don't use but geeks do.

01:18:49.897 --> 01:18:51.523
What would Milo want in here anyway?

01:18:51.523 --> 01:18:53.984
They know.
Just don't trust me with it,

01:18:53.984 --> 01:18:56.236
so we will get
the evidence first,

01:18:56.236 --> 01:18:59.698
ask questions later, here,
get started on that one

01:19:12.211 --> 01:19:13.921
What if he knows what we are doing.

01:19:13.921 --> 01:19:15.547
Do you think he is toying with us??

01:19:15.547 --> 01:19:17.925
- How much time do you need?
- Two days

01:19:17.925 --> 01:19:19.718
Now did you write the code
to sequence the video files?

01:19:19.718 --> 01:19:21.804
Yes and the audio is done.

01:19:21.804 --> 01:19:25.265
The text file feeds
your voice synchronizer

01:19:29.478 --> 01:19:31.939
Hey, you're back

01:19:31.939 --> 01:19:33.774
I bought a hu-din cook book.

01:19:33.774 --> 01:19:37.236
'Cause we're always afraid for you eating
in Chinese restaurants

01:19:37.236 --> 01:19:43.951
I've been mincing and chopping things
into tinny weenie pieces all afternoon

01:19:43.951 --> 01:19:45.369
But you never cook

01:19:45.369 --> 01:19:46.578
I know

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:52.125
I'm gonna go change

01:21:12.456 --> 01:21:14.291
no escaping

01:21:17.461 --> 01:21:20.422
- You look beautiful
- Thank you

01:21:31.934 --> 01:21:33.227
Milo

01:21:35.687 --> 01:21:38.273
Ah, I'm gonna go upstairs and get changed

01:21:38.273 --> 01:21:40.484
I love the way you look

01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:42.903
Thanks

01:21:48.534 --> 01:21:51.036
Hey, do we have any chopsticks?

01:21:51.036 --> 01:21:52.079
Yeah

01:22:30.033 --> 01:22:31.076
Great

01:22:33.912 --> 01:22:36.081
Wait, um....

01:22:36.081 --> 01:22:39.459
right, a toast.

01:22:50.971 --> 01:22:52.764
To a long life

01:23:44.107 --> 01:23:47.986
- Is it good?
- It's delicious

01:23:47.986 --> 01:23:50.739
Yeah

01:23:50.739 --> 01:23:53.200
There's something
that I need to tell you

01:23:53.200 --> 01:23:54.159
What?

01:23:59.998 --> 01:24:01.792
I love you

01:24:11.969 --> 01:24:14.429
- Rebecca
- Yeah

01:24:34.324 --> 01:24:40.205
Come on, Come on, Come on,
see.

01:24:40.205 --> 01:24:41.915
Who needs computers

01:24:49.131 --> 01:24:54.636
Gary believe me,
I am looking at his prints right now.

01:24:54.636 --> 01:24:57.681
You want Phil to handle it.

01:24:57.681 --> 01:24:59.683
Whatever you say.

01:24:59.933 --> 01:25:01.185
Bastards!

01:26:05.791 --> 01:26:06.959
Oh no,

01:26:06.959 --> 01:26:09.586
you don't get by me twice kid !

01:26:12.214 --> 01:26:15.050
- You gonna call Gary?
- Screw Gray?

01:26:38.907 --> 01:26:41.118
Bob, these guys are criminals.

01:26:43.620 --> 01:26:45.581
Now, I am gonna go out on a limb here

01:26:45.581 --> 01:26:49.585
because there's very good chance that you're
not gonna believe a word of what I’m about to tell you.

01:26:53.589 --> 01:26:57.092
You'd be surprised what I believe
about these people

01:26:58.635 --> 01:27:00.637
Show me what you got there

01:27:27.623 --> 01:27:29.416
- Milo
- Get your laptop. We're going tonight.

01:27:29.416 --> 01:27:31.001
You said two days

01:27:31.001 --> 01:27:32.961
So, I’m a genius

01:27:40.219 --> 01:27:41.929
- We're not ready.
- Yes, we are - You said two days

01:27:41.929 --> 01:27:44.598
Lisa, you gotta trust me, okay?

01:27:44.598 --> 01:27:46.934
I need you to trust me

01:27:47.935 --> 01:27:48.852
Okay

01:27:51.730 --> 01:27:53.649
All right

01:27:53.649 --> 01:27:59.154
He left campus,
he taken some surveillance data with him

01:27:59.154 --> 01:28:00.364
Don't worry,

01:28:00.364 --> 01:28:01.490
we know where he is

01:28:35.023 --> 01:28:37.234
Is Brain here?
Brain Vissel ?

01:28:37.234 --> 01:28:38.694
Who wants to see him?

01:28:45.242 --> 01:28:47.536
What's going on here?
You sounded insane on the phone.

01:28:47.536 --> 01:28:49.621
We need to do a live broadcast, right now.

01:28:49.621 --> 01:28:51.748
You can't, preempt yoga
that's our biggest show

01:28:51.748 --> 01:28:54.293
Brain, you want to be
a big deal in life, right?

01:28:54.293 --> 01:28:55.752
That's your dream, isn't it?

01:28:56.086 --> 01:28:57.462
Will it mean
I will get to work for NURV?

01:28:57.462 --> 01:28:58.630
After this,
there won't be a NURV.

01:28:58.630 --> 01:29:00.215
We're ganna bring him down
and you're going to help us

01:29:00.215 --> 01:29:04.303
- That's the most insane thing I ever..
- Come on, man, what have they ever done for you?

01:29:06.555 --> 01:29:08.307
- Okay
- Great

01:29:09.099 --> 01:29:10.684
You wanna be a part of history?

01:29:10.684 --> 01:29:13.437
- Not really
- All right,

01:29:15.981 --> 01:29:18.025
how about, not sure.. 132 bucks.

01:29:27.534 --> 01:29:30.329
Forward your hands behind your back.

01:29:30.329 --> 01:29:38.253
Lift the stardom bone, lift the arms,
through the hip... slowly

01:29:53.393 --> 01:29:56.396
- You're interfaced with the dish
- ok

01:29:56.396 --> 01:29:58.690
Read me these IP addresses
starting with number one.

01:29:58.899 --> 01:29:59.942
Wait..

01:30:01.193 --> 01:30:03.445
Phil, come over here,
it's almost 10 o’clock,

01:30:03.445 --> 01:30:05.531
- we're going to shutdown
the mother satellites.
- What?

01:30:05.531 --> 01:30:08.283
Read me the IP addresses
starting with one - Gary

01:30:08.283 --> 01:30:10.619
Just do it, Phil

01:30:10.619 --> 01:30:12.955
It's gone way too far already.

01:30:22.131 --> 01:30:23.465
Go!
Go!

01:30:23.465 --> 01:30:24.925

01:30:24.925 --> 01:30:26.009
24.

01:30:26.009 --> 01:30:27.511
53.

01:30:27.511 --> 01:30:29.054
192.

01:30:38.188 --> 01:30:40.399
Come on, come on..
Come on, come on..

01:30:52.161 --> 01:30:54.496
It's your software?
Is it your dish?

01:30:54.496 --> 01:30:56.582
Alright, number 2
Go

01:30:56.582 --> 01:30:58.584
Give me number 2

01:30:58.584 --> 01:31:00.502
Milo, you got some weird

01:31:00.502 --> 01:31:03.714
Brain, don't worry about it.
Just give me number 2

01:31:03.714 --> 01:31:04.840
10.

01:31:04.840 --> 01:31:05.549
43.

01:31:05.549 --> 01:31:06.049
84.

01:31:06.049 --> 01:31:07.426
143.

01:31:15.434 --> 01:31:16.643
Come on, come on..

01:31:20.898 --> 01:31:22.608
Damn it

01:31:30.073 --> 01:31:31.283
Okay, get out of the hell!!

01:31:32.618 --> 01:31:34.703
- Checked your connection?
- Yes

01:31:34.703 --> 01:31:36.497
- He knows
- What?

01:31:36.497 --> 01:31:38.123
He's shutting down
the satellites one step ahead

01:31:38.123 --> 01:31:40.918
Go to the end.
Give me number 12

01:31:40.918 --> 01:31:44.797
- 42.
- Wait,

01:31:44.797 --> 01:31:46.340
he knows I am shutting them down

01:31:46.423 --> 01:31:49.301
-What?
- I know how his mind works

01:31:49.301 --> 01:31:50.969
Give me the last one, Number 12

01:31:50.969 --> 01:31:53.180
- Gary
- Just do it!

01:31:55.849 --> 01:31:57.184
Ah, give me number 5

01:31:59.853 --> 01:32:01.855

01:32:01.855 --> 01:32:02.731
Hurry up, hurry up
230.

01:32:02.731 --> 01:32:04.566
Open the door Milo!

01:32:04.566 --> 01:32:06.985
One more second

01:32:15.202 --> 01:32:19.706
Guys, we're okay.
Got it under control

01:32:22.709 --> 01:32:24.920
Give us the disks Milo,
come on!

01:32:27.256 --> 01:32:30.259
The disks, Milo, now.
come on, it's over

01:32:57.828 --> 01:32:59.955
Hey, hey, asshole!

01:33:40.829 --> 01:33:44.583
What's with the mission impossible 3,
bull shit, Milo ?

01:33:44.583 --> 01:33:46.210
You're a geek

01:33:49.713 --> 01:33:52.049
Excellent!

01:33:52.049 --> 01:33:54.968
They'll be back here in five minutes
with Milo and the disk.

01:33:54.968 --> 01:33:56.261
Good

01:33:57.012 --> 01:33:58.764
What do you want to do with him?

01:34:01.683 --> 01:34:03.769
Surprise me.

01:34:07.815 --> 01:34:10.984
Ok, Mr. Schride,
I need the disk that Milo gave you

01:34:14.571 --> 01:34:17.282
You got something
non-geeky I can do?

01:34:17.282 --> 01:34:20.786
- Yeah, we're gonna need a TV set in here
- You got it

01:34:42.224 --> 01:34:44.852
So what are you typing
in there, Larry?

01:34:44.852 --> 01:34:48.230
IP address, it's like calling
up a satellites on the phone

01:34:48.230 --> 01:34:51.525
The first two haven't picked up.
Come on pick up man.

01:35:04.663 --> 01:35:06.623
Thank you

01:35:06.623 --> 01:35:08.375
And thank you.

01:35:08.375 --> 01:35:11.920
You have achieved a miraculous thing

01:35:11.920 --> 01:35:13.797
I'm so proud of you

01:35:13.797 --> 01:35:15.257
Forgive me of my method's but

01:35:15.257 --> 01:35:19.803
when you got off courses, we had to
motivate you to keep working on SYNAPSE

01:35:19.803 --> 01:35:21.847
Without Lisa here urgings you on,

01:35:21.847 --> 01:35:23.307
We might not have made it

01:35:23.307 --> 01:35:24.433
It's true, Milo,

01:35:24.433 --> 01:35:26.810
what we have done is so important.

01:35:30.481 --> 01:35:33.317
Oh my god.
What?

01:35:33.650 --> 01:35:35.319
Oh my god.

01:35:41.992 --> 01:35:43.494
Gary

01:36:16.652 --> 01:36:19.905
Who's got SYNAPSE, Milo?

01:36:19.905 --> 01:36:23.367
Does that mean we did it?
Does this mean we did it?

01:36:25.869 --> 01:36:27.454
Wow, yeah man

01:36:27.454 --> 01:36:30.082
That's what I’m talking about,
- That's fantastic!!

01:36:30.082 --> 01:36:31.834
Yeah, you're Jim brooklin
a never seen us coming and

01:36:31.834 --> 01:36:33.377
were coming

01:36:33.377 --> 01:36:38.382
Consumers don't care where new ideas come from
just so long as they're offered at a competitive price,

01:36:38.382 --> 01:36:40.259
the Software business violent.

01:36:40.259 --> 01:36:43.011
There're a one or a zero,
alive or dead

01:36:43.011 --> 01:36:46.807
You're a one or a zero.
Alive or dead, or dead

01:36:46.807 --> 01:36:49.935
We do have a monopoly,
we do have a monopoly here.

01:36:49.935 --> 01:36:52.855
Those who don't innovate are doomed

01:36:52.855 --> 01:36:54.189
to die doomed to die.

01:36:54.189 --> 01:36:56.608
to die. to die.
doomed to die.

01:36:56.608 --> 01:36:59.695
There is no second place

01:36:59.695 --> 01:37:03.157
SYNAPSE will fully unite
the global village

01:37:03.157 --> 01:37:06.577
New ideas are ready to be
devoured, devoured, re-defined

01:37:06.577 --> 01:37:07.911
This business is binary,

01:37:07.911 --> 01:37:11.165
either a one or a zero,
a zero, a zero,

01:37:11.165 --> 01:37:16.545
alive or dead, alive or dead,
alive or dead, alive, dead, alive.

01:37:16.545 --> 01:37:18.547
Surrounded by predators.
Those who don't innovate

01:37:18.547 --> 01:37:21.508
Those who don't innovate

01:37:21.508 --> 01:37:25.304
are doomed to die
There is no second place

01:37:25.304 --> 01:37:29.433
Consumers don't care where new ideas come from

01:37:29.433 --> 01:37:31.894
just so long as they are offered at a competitive price

01:37:31.894 --> 01:37:34.021
anywhere in the World
anywhere in the World

01:37:34.021 --> 01:37:36.690
with a good idea can put us out of business

01:37:36.690 --> 01:37:38.150
Alive or dead

01:37:38.150 --> 01:37:40.444
We do have a monopoly here at NURV.

01:37:40.444 --> 01:37:42.529
There's no second place

01:37:42.529 --> 01:37:45.157
You're a one or a zero, alive or dead

01:37:47.451 --> 01:37:49.453
Are you insane? What do you think you're doing?

01:37:49.453 --> 01:37:51.079
I'm letting people know
what you've been doing

01:37:51.079 --> 01:37:52.289
Phil, where is this signal coming from?

01:37:52.289 --> 01:37:53.874
I'm working on it, I am working on it.

01:37:53.874 --> 01:37:55.125
Work faster!!

01:37:55.125 --> 01:37:58.128
A good chess player always knows
his opponents moves before he makes them.

01:37:58.128 --> 01:38:02.341
Isn't that right Gray?
- You think you know all my moves?
You arrogant little bastard

01:38:02.341 --> 01:38:04.510
You think they gonna come after me,

01:38:04.510 --> 01:38:05.844
now that SYNAPSE is here !

01:38:05.844 --> 01:38:08.972
This is the technology that'll
fuel business for the next 30 years

01:38:08.972 --> 01:38:12.351
You think they gonna allow foreign
competitors an opening like that?

01:38:12.351 --> 01:38:14.353
Undermined the entire economy

01:38:14.353 --> 01:38:16.772
Over what? A cyber prank?

01:38:16.772 --> 01:38:19.233
Then you don't have anything
to worry about. Do you?

01:38:23.153 --> 01:38:25.614
The Lawyers at the gate Gary.
They say the Feds are on their way.

01:38:25.614 --> 01:38:27.366
Oh Jesus.

01:38:27.366 --> 01:38:29.117
It's coming from NURV, it's building 21

01:38:29.117 --> 01:38:30.744
Call security, get someone over there now.

01:38:30.744 --> 01:38:32.162
Break down the door, if yo have to

01:38:32.162 --> 01:38:34.206
but get me that disk. Get it here

01:38:34.206 --> 01:38:36.792
- How did this happen Phil?
- I don't know,

01:38:36.875 --> 01:38:41.338
she called, she said Milo
had SYNAPSE, he'd left the campus and..

01:38:43.465 --> 01:38:48.262
You lied, for him...
You're playing with fire

01:38:48.262 --> 01:38:50.848
If you think for second I won't
send you back where you came from.

01:38:50.848 --> 01:38:53.225
Hey Gary
I want you to see this

01:38:59.773 --> 01:39:01.859
Are you still proud of me?

01:39:16.665 --> 01:39:20.627
You guys know where you need to be..
Go, go, go!!

01:39:20.627 --> 01:39:23.255
Rany, Danny come on lets get out of here
Come on, Let's go, let's go.

01:39:27.509 --> 01:39:30.012
Rebecca, Rebecca come on, let's go.

01:39:32.556 --> 01:39:36.351
I'm not going with you

01:39:36.351 --> 01:39:40.314
I would rather stay here and
face the consequences of my own actions,

01:39:40.314 --> 01:39:42.983
than be associate with yours

01:39:47.279 --> 01:39:48.614
This was mine, Milo

01:39:48.614 --> 01:39:51.742
You tell that to the people
you stole it from, tell it to Teddy

01:39:51.742 --> 01:39:56.079
Come on, it's only a matter of time
before someone owns the information

01:39:56.079 --> 01:39:58.207
You can't stop it, you slowed it down

01:39:58.207 --> 01:40:01.210
I slowed you down Gary.
That's what matter to me

01:40:01.210 --> 01:40:03.003
This isn't a game.

01:40:03.003 --> 01:40:07.424
In the real world, when you kill people,
they die. For real!

01:40:07.424 --> 01:40:10.052
And in the real world,
you're Fucked!

01:40:15.432 --> 01:40:17.684
Are you coming?

01:40:26.193 --> 01:40:27.653
Let them go

01:40:28.654 --> 01:40:32.032
Tomorrow, he is
the most famous geek in the world

01:40:37.412 --> 01:40:39.665
Gary, we need information
I’ve been betrayed

01:40:39.665 --> 01:40:41.792
Randy and Phil are missing?

01:40:41.792 --> 01:40:45.003
Something's going on! Take this down

01:40:46.922 --> 01:40:49.466
Come to my attention,

01:40:49.466 --> 01:40:53.762
Certain rouge elements of my company
have been involved in illegal activities

01:40:53.762 --> 01:40:58.058
in an attempt to discredit me and
risk control of my company.

01:40:58.058 --> 01:41:01.520
I'm most shocked and upset by this betrayal.

01:41:01.520 --> 01:41:06.984
I will do everything in my power
to co-operate with the authorities
and  bring these criminals to Justice.

01:41:06.984 --> 01:41:10.988
News that the FBI agent have arrested
NURV CEO Gray Winston,

01:41:10.988 --> 01:41:14.783
TV's, cell phones and PC's were
interrupted world wide last night

01:41:14.783 --> 01:41:19.079
by a huge broadcast
initiated by programmer Milo Hoffmann.

01:41:19.079 --> 01:41:25.335
Police have also arrested these other members of
Winston’s team at a Portland airfield
as they attempted to board a private jet.

01:41:25.335 --> 01:41:28.338
Justice officials reacted swiftly..

01:41:28.338 --> 01:41:31.592
Man, Clinton testimony didn't get this many hits

01:41:31.592 --> 01:41:34.052
This is, this is awesome

01:41:34.052 --> 01:41:36.555
I mean there is 400 requests a second, Brain.

01:41:36.555 --> 01:41:41.059
We did this! I'm surprised
this isn't blowing the server

01:41:41.059 --> 01:41:43.228
Wow, Whoa get over here

01:41:43.228 --> 01:41:45.022
Come here, Come here

01:41:45.022 --> 01:41:51.236
Already over 18 million people have
downloaded the source code for
SYNAPSE from the Skullbox website.

01:41:51.236 --> 01:41:55.741
Now Skullbox is thought to have originated
right here in this Palo Alto garage

01:42:07.878 --> 01:42:11.298
- Hi there, I just have a couple of questions for you
- Is Milo Hoffmann going to testify

01:42:11.298 --> 01:42:12.800
Do you know where he is now?

01:42:13.550 --> 01:42:15.969
How many hits have you guy's registered?

01:42:16.804 --> 01:42:19.473
What's your relationship to Milo Hoffmann?

01:42:21.975 --> 01:42:24.436
- Good luck
- Okay

01:42:27.815 --> 01:42:30.108
Milo

01:42:30.108 --> 01:42:31.735
It wasn't all false

01:42:34.613 --> 01:42:36.698
I Know

01:42:36.698 --> 01:42:37.825
Bye

01:42:42.329 --> 01:42:45.499
Do you consider this an
ultraman victory for open source

01:42:51.380 --> 01:42:52.840
Excuse me

01:42:58.679 --> 01:42:59.930
We did it partner

01:43:00.347 --> 01:43:01.598
Are you going to testify?

01:43:02.307 --> 01:43:04.309
Winston always said
that any kid in a garage

01:43:04.309 --> 01:43:07.271
could put him out of business,
is that what you've done Milo?

01:43:07.271 --> 01:43:08.856
This is a garage

01:43:08.856 --> 01:43:10.357
Hey, there he is.

01:43:10.774 --> 01:43:12.985
Just now getting word that,

01:43:12.985 --> 01:43:16.488
yes, yes here he is,
here is Gary Winston

01:43:16.488 --> 01:43:20.367
being led by US marshals
to the federal court in Portland....

01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:29.042
Milo, when did you first realize
Gary Winston's stealing code

01:43:29.042 --> 01:43:31.837
What is it exactly that you think
you have done Milo?

01:43:31.837 --> 01:43:33.005
And what does it all mean?

01:43:33.005 --> 01:43:36.675
It means we've given SYNAPSE back
to the people it was stolen from.

01:43:36.675 --> 01:43:38.719
Human knowledge belongs to the world

01:43:38.719 --> 01:43:41.472
Can we get a picture of the Skullbox team?

01:43:42.305 --> 01:43:48.215
