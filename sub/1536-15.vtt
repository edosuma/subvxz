00:01.000 --> 00:02.286
Previously on Grimm...

00:02.800 --> 00:05.041
Look for a
book that won't open.

00:08.119 --> 00:09.451
Here's the spell she used.

00:09.520 --> 00:10.681
Adalind called me.

00:11.280 --> 00:14.284
She wanted to come over and I
told her I was going to be out.

00:15.080 --> 00:16.800
She knew you
weren't going to be home.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.000
Nick, it wasn't me.

00:18.120 --> 00:19.121
If that was Adalind...

00:19.200 --> 00:20.690
Oh, my God!
I'm gonna be sick!

00:20.920 --> 00:22.251
You don't know, do you?

00:22.320 --> 00:23.321
What?

00:23.520 --> 00:26.967
You are going to
have another baby.

00:27.320 --> 00:29.601
Is this what you want to spend
the rest of your life with?

00:31.280 --> 00:32.805
This is what's forever.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.769
"One could have called that
shape a woman or a boy:

00:48.840 --> 00:51.844
"for it seemed neither
and seemed both."

01:03.400 --> 01:04.480
Ahhh!

01:19.000 --> 01:21.810
Oh, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no!

01:57.040 --> 01:59.400
Hi, you've reached Juliette.
Leave a message.

01:59.760 --> 02:01.000
Juliette, call me.

02:02.320 --> 02:04.049
We need to talk about this.

02:08.840 --> 02:10.126
You good?

02:20.440 --> 02:22.408
I love Portland, don't you?

02:30.520 --> 02:32.010
Time for me to go.

02:37.760 --> 02:39.000
What can I get you?

02:39.080 --> 02:40.684
A decent husband.

02:40.960 --> 02:43.930
Sorry, just a dirty martini.

02:48.160 --> 02:50.242
Excuse me, are you okay?

02:51.480 --> 02:52.845
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine.

02:54.840 --> 02:56.763
Oh, God, this is so stupid!

02:58.360 --> 02:59.725
What?

02:59.800 --> 03:02.326
Coming to a bar
and watching myself cry.

03:02.400 --> 03:04.767
I mean, I can just
do that at home.

03:04.960 --> 03:06.160
Why would you want to do that?

03:06.480 --> 03:07.766
My husband just left me.

03:08.440 --> 03:09.441
Oh.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.651
Thank you.

03:20.800 --> 03:24.009
Well, I hope everything
turns out all right.

03:24.440 --> 03:25.601
Well, he was a liar,

03:25.680 --> 03:26.966
so it turned out for the best.

03:28.440 --> 03:30.363
I was just with him
for half of my life

03:30.480 --> 03:32.761
and I don't even know what it's
like to be single anymore.

03:32.840 --> 03:35.969
Well,
it's not all that great.

03:37.360 --> 03:39.966
But, I mean, a beautiful
woman like yourself...

03:40.240 --> 03:41.480
You're just being nice.

03:41.680 --> 03:42.966
I'm being honest.

03:45.680 --> 03:47.967
I haven't had honest
in a really long time.

04:25.160 --> 04:27.367
Be right back.

04:42.840 --> 04:44.410
Be there in a second!

04:52.120 --> 04:53.167
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

04:53.240 --> 04:54.969
Oh, my God! What? Nothing!

04:55.040 --> 04:56.087
Where is she?
Who?

04:56.160 --> 04:57.400
My wife! I followed you here!

04:57.560 --> 04:59.847
Your wife?
She said that you left her!

04:59.960 --> 05:02.167
Yeah? How long you been
seeing her, Cody Carson?

05:02.320 --> 05:04.766
We just met! We haven't done anything.
We just got here.

05:04.960 --> 05:06.803
Shut up. I'm gonna kill you.
I'm gonna kill both of you.

05:06.880 --> 05:08.962
No, please. Please. No.

05:11.480 --> 05:12.481
Uh...

05:12.560 --> 05:15.245
You don't want to do that. There's
$500 in that wallet. You can have it.

05:15.320 --> 05:16.446
I don't want your money.

05:16.520 --> 05:18.090
Please, just take it
and let me go.

05:18.400 --> 05:20.607
I have kids and a wife!

05:21.000 --> 05:23.082
I love her so much.

05:28.280 --> 05:31.090
I'm just gonna...
Um, here.

05:32.320 --> 05:36.609
I'm just gonna leave you two to
work out your marital problems.

05:37.160 --> 05:41.085
Okay? Work things out.
I'm sorry. Sorry.

05:44.960 --> 05:46.450
Oh, my God.

05:53.240 --> 05:55.129
No way. What the...

06:02.600 --> 06:04.090
Where's my phone?

06:04.600 --> 06:06.011
Where's my phone!

06:30.480 --> 06:31.970
So, why did you lie to me
about your husband?

06:32.160 --> 06:34.040
Let go of me. Hey, you
told me that he left you!

06:34.160 --> 06:36.288
I want my money,
and my phone back!

06:36.360 --> 06:37.600
Get off of me.

06:38.480 --> 06:40.801
I want them back, or else
I'm gonna call the police!

06:41.080 --> 06:42.161
Hmm.

06:42.320 --> 06:44.527
Well, you're pretty brave
when it's just a woman.

06:44.600 --> 06:45.726
What?

06:51.360 --> 06:52.805
Ah! No!

07:33.880 --> 07:36.884
Victim was found early this
morning by a maintenance guy.

07:38.000 --> 07:39.570
Witnesses?
Not yet.

07:41.560 --> 07:42.925
Looks like an acid attack.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.889
Cody Carson.
Augusta, Maine.

07:52.000 --> 07:54.162
So, what was Cody Carson
doing in Portland?

07:54.360 --> 07:56.124
We got a key for
the Benson Hotel.

07:56.880 --> 07:59.247
All credit cards here, no cash.

07:59.560 --> 08:00.721
Robbery gone bad?

08:01.080 --> 08:03.600
They usually don't put the wallet
back after stealing the money.

08:03.720 --> 08:06.610
Unless you wanted the police to
think it wasn't a robbery gone bad.

08:12.000 --> 08:15.083
Mr. Carson checked into the
Benson Hotel three days ago.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.685
According to the hotel manager,

08:16.760 --> 08:18.250
Carson wasn't due to
leave for another week.

08:18.360 --> 08:20.408
His clothes and his suitcase
were still in his room.

08:20.520 --> 08:21.567
Our victim was here on business,

08:21.640 --> 08:23.085
works for Mason Freight.

08:23.160 --> 08:24.366
We found a cell phone charger,

08:24.480 --> 08:25.970
but no cell phone on his person,

08:26.040 --> 08:27.371
in his car, or in his room.

08:27.440 --> 08:29.090
He probably left it
wherever he was last night.

08:29.240 --> 08:30.321
Yeah, we got his
number from the hotel,

08:30.400 --> 08:31.606
we're trying to run it down.

08:31.720 --> 08:33.370
Do we know how the victim
got these burns?

08:33.520 --> 08:35.010
According to the ME, the victim

08:35.080 --> 08:36.605
choked to death
on viscous matter,

08:36.679 --> 08:38.330
which then ate its way
through his lungs

08:38.400 --> 08:40.482
and moved on to other organs.

08:40.600 --> 08:42.203
He said the substance
is consistent with

08:42.280 --> 08:45.090
a parasitic enzyme like
necrotizing fasciitis.

08:45.200 --> 08:48.522
It's a skin-eating bacteria
found in contaminated water.

08:48.600 --> 08:51.046
Yeah, apparently there are certain
animals that produce this enzyme

08:51.120 --> 08:52.929
that eat through body tissue.

08:53.000 --> 08:56.971
Spiders, earthworms,
snails, slugs, insects,

08:57.040 --> 08:59.850
and some plants,
like the Venus flytrap.

09:00.120 --> 09:01.121
Sounds Wesen to me.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.282
Or we're looking
for a big-ass snail.

09:03.600 --> 09:05.284
Do we know what the victim was
doing in that neighborhood?

09:05.360 --> 09:08.284
Not yet, the car was parked on the
street, no restaurants or bars nearby.

09:08.440 --> 09:10.204
Well, maybe he had
a friend in the area.

09:10.360 --> 09:11.486
That's what we're thinking.

09:11.560 --> 09:12.846
Yeah?

09:12.960 --> 09:14.920
Got an approximate location
for the victim's cell.

09:15.080 --> 09:17.606
It's in a condo near
where his body was found.

09:21.360 --> 09:22.566
Getting warmer.

09:24.400 --> 09:25.686
Warmer.

09:26.560 --> 09:28.005
Warmer.

09:29.480 --> 09:30.686
This is it.

09:31.200 --> 09:32.565
The phone's inside.

09:32.680 --> 09:33.920
You know
who owns it?

09:34.000 --> 09:35.081
It belongs to Matt Robbins.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.685
But he's not here right now.

09:36.760 --> 09:38.250
He moved to New York last year,

09:38.320 --> 09:39.924
rents out the condo
through an Internet service.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.331
We're gonna need
his phone information.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.447
I've got that in my office.

09:42.560 --> 09:43.607
Can you get us inside?

09:43.680 --> 09:45.170
Uh, yes. I have the key.

09:45.280 --> 09:46.770
But it's rented out right now.

09:46.840 --> 09:47.966
To who?

09:48.040 --> 09:49.201
I don't know.

09:49.280 --> 09:50.964
I have her name in the file,
I gave her the key,

09:51.040 --> 09:52.280
that's what I do for the owner.

09:52.520 --> 09:54.363
Can you describe her?
Yes.

09:54.560 --> 09:56.164
She was very pretty,

09:56.280 --> 09:59.204
taller than me,
dark hair, brown eyes.

09:59.920 --> 10:01.445
Um, seemed about 30.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.326
Very nice.

10:04.360 --> 10:06.328
God, I hope nothing
happened to her in there.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.808
Hello, it's the manager.

10:08.920 --> 10:11.048
I'm here with the police
and we have to come in.

10:17.200 --> 10:18.560
Can you just
wait right here?

10:21.040 --> 10:22.883
Gotta be somewhere in here.

10:24.840 --> 10:26.205
Looks pretty empty.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.570
There's nothing here.
Not even a sock.

10:31.560 --> 10:32.607
Hmm.

10:32.680 --> 10:34.250
Doesn't look like
anybody lives here.

10:44.720 --> 10:46.290
If she was here, she's gone now.

10:47.520 --> 10:48.521
Got it!

10:52.400 --> 10:55.006
So, what do we
think Cody was doing

10:55.080 --> 10:57.160
in a bedroom with a pretty
woman sometime last night?

10:57.240 --> 10:58.526
No sign of foul play.

10:58.760 --> 11:01.286
Let's get CSU in here and check
for semen, dust for prints.

11:01.360 --> 11:02.441
Yeah.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.001
Well, whatever happened here,

11:05.080 --> 11:06.360
they sure cleaned up
pretty good.

11:07.760 --> 11:09.569
Was the woman with him?
Did she kill him?

11:09.640 --> 11:10.687
Well, if you're gonna kill him,

11:10.760 --> 11:13.081
why do you kill him outside
where anyone can see you?

11:13.160 --> 11:14.286
Why not do it in here?

11:14.440 --> 11:16.204
Well, maybe it wasn't the woman,
maybe it was someone else.

11:16.400 --> 11:18.209
I think we better find
this pretty woman.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.771
Well, I don't hear
or see anything abnormal.

11:27.320 --> 11:29.846
Scar tissue looks fine,
no sign of any tears.

11:29.920 --> 11:31.365
How much blood was there?

11:32.840 --> 11:33.966
No, no, no, no!

11:34.600 --> 11:35.761
Um...

11:36.280 --> 11:37.645
Maybe less than I thought.

11:38.440 --> 11:40.568
It was middle of the night,
I was half asleep.

11:40.800 --> 11:44.043
Well, I can do an MRI, but I'm not
seeing anything out of the ordinary.

11:44.440 --> 11:45.771
How do you feel?

11:46.640 --> 11:48.244
Actually, I feel okay.

11:49.160 --> 11:50.889
Well, why don't we go ahead
and schedule the MRI

11:50.960 --> 11:52.041
just to make sure?
Mmm-hmm.

11:52.120 --> 11:53.645
But, you know, I wouldn't worry.

11:57.640 --> 12:00.769
The owner of the condo hasn't been
in Portland for about a year.

12:00.840 --> 12:03.286
He rented the condo
to a woman from Omaha.

12:03.360 --> 12:04.691
Alexis Toynbee.

12:05.000 --> 12:08.083
But Alexis Toynbee is 60 years
old and she's still in Omaha.

12:08.160 --> 12:09.605
So, we got a case
of identity theft.

12:09.680 --> 12:12.160
Whoever rented the condo used
Toynbee's name and credit card.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.641
But who goes through the trouble of
getting a fake ID and credit card

12:14.720 --> 12:16.245
just to rent a condo
for one night?

12:16.400 --> 12:17.686
Someone who wanted
to do something bad

12:17.760 --> 12:19.040
in a condo
and not leave a trail.

12:19.080 --> 12:21.651
Got a hit on a fingerprint
inside the condo.

12:21.880 --> 12:23.689
But it's not a woman's.

12:24.200 --> 12:26.089
I thought it might just be
a random until I got this.

12:26.160 --> 12:28.208
Linus Balouzian.
From Louisville, Kentucky.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.163
Got a record as a con man,

12:30.240 --> 12:31.730
and a car registered
in his name.

12:31.880 --> 12:32.920
We got a last known?

12:32.960 --> 12:33.960
In a way.

12:34.000 --> 12:35.445
The condo gets cleaned
after every rental.

12:35.520 --> 12:36.806
It was cleaned this last Friday,

12:36.880 --> 12:39.929
so that puts Mr. Balouzian
in the condo this week.

12:40.000 --> 12:42.924
So, Mr. Balouzian and our
victim were in a condo

12:43.000 --> 12:45.241
rented by an attractive woman
with a fake identity.

12:46.640 --> 12:48.130
Sound like a con
to anybody else?

12:48.200 --> 12:50.771
Maybe Linus is working
with this mystery woman.

12:50.840 --> 12:53.320
And Cody got caught up in whatever
game the two of them are playing.

12:53.480 --> 12:55.320
My guess is, you come
all this way to Portland,

12:55.440 --> 12:56.930
you're going to play
this gag more than once.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.844
I checked with Robbery, they've
been hearing about businessmen,

12:59.920 --> 13:02.241
single guys from out of town,
being trick-rolled.

13:02.360 --> 13:04.010
Put out an APB
on Balouzian's car.

13:04.120 --> 13:05.201
Yeah.

13:06.040 --> 13:09.408
If Balouzian's the guy who attacked
our victim, he could be Wesen.

13:09.880 --> 13:11.006
What kind, is the question.

13:11.080 --> 13:12.800
And if they're gonna
pull this again, where?

13:13.360 --> 13:15.966
If they rented the first condo
using Toynbee's identity,

13:16.040 --> 13:17.360
maybe they used
it more than once.

13:17.400 --> 13:18.526
Let's run the names again,

13:18.600 --> 13:20.887
see if we can come up with any
other fraudulent charges.

13:23.160 --> 13:25.322
Stacy,
this is all your fault!

13:25.400 --> 13:28.165
If you had just gone out
the back like I told you,

13:28.240 --> 13:29.730
he never would have seen you.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.563
Now the cops
are gonna be all over us.

13:33.240 --> 13:34.800
So, you better get
your sweet ass ready,

13:34.840 --> 13:37.241
'cause you are
going out again tonight.

13:37.320 --> 13:41.041
Find us another one!
And no more screw ups!

13:45.920 --> 13:47.729
Are you listening to me?

13:52.600 --> 13:54.090
You think this is my fault?

13:55.240 --> 13:57.083
Linus, you are such an idiot.

13:57.160 --> 13:58.844
I can't believe he's blaming me.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.010
This is such crap.

14:08.360 --> 14:10.840
Without me,
this wouldn't even work.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.770
Thanks, Brad.
See you next week.

14:17.040 --> 14:18.201
Okay.

14:22.080 --> 14:23.320
Sean.

14:28.360 --> 14:29.771
Rosalee,

14:30.640 --> 14:31.721
Um...

14:31.840 --> 14:33.285
I think I might have a problem.

14:34.320 --> 14:35.765
A problem?

14:37.160 --> 14:38.685
What... What kind of problem?

14:38.880 --> 14:40.245
You helped my mother
figure out what Adalind

14:40.320 --> 14:42.288
had done to Nick
and how to fix it.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.244
Yeah, good times.

14:44.360 --> 14:47.330
There was a book that Adalind
used to cast a spell.

14:47.400 --> 14:48.970
Yes, we still have it.

14:49.040 --> 14:50.371
Okay, good.
I was hoping you did.

14:50.640 --> 14:52.005
What's the problem?

14:53.800 --> 14:55.928
I'm not exactly sure,
but it appears to be

14:56.040 --> 14:58.281
related to what my
mother did to save my life.

14:58.360 --> 15:01.091
Some sort of residual effect

15:01.160 --> 15:03.322
from my visit to the other side.

15:04.720 --> 15:06.643
You mean,
as in when you were dead?

15:06.840 --> 15:08.001
Yeah.

15:09.120 --> 15:11.805
Yeah, I keep reliving the moment
that I was shot over and over.

15:11.880 --> 15:16.488
And I wake up and I have
blood all over me,

15:16.600 --> 15:19.490
and it's as though I've just been
shot again and I'm bleeding to death.

15:19.800 --> 15:20.847
That does not sound good.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.004
And you're hoping the answer
to this is in the book?

15:24.120 --> 15:25.167
I am.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.164
Your mother
shut the book.

15:32.360 --> 15:34.840
So, I'm hoping you can
open it, because we can't.

15:41.360 --> 15:42.407
How'd she open it?

15:42.480 --> 15:43.560
Uh, with her blood.

15:43.800 --> 15:45.609
Big knife,
right in the middle of her...

15:46.760 --> 15:48.842
She's your mother,
maybe your blood will work.

15:49.040 --> 15:50.724
No, if that kind of lock
has been cast upon it,

15:50.800 --> 15:52.768
then only Hexenbiest
blood can open it.

15:52.880 --> 15:54.848
Don't suppose she's coming
back to town anytime soon.

15:54.920 --> 15:56.081
Not that I know of.

15:56.160 --> 15:58.880
And I'm guessing you don't want to
bring Adalind in for help on this.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.411
No, not really.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.168
Well, you know any
other Hexenbiests?

16:28.680 --> 16:30.440
Hi, you've reached Juliette.
Leave a message.

16:32.120 --> 16:33.884
Juliette, it's me.

16:35.240 --> 16:38.210
We need to talk.
Please, please call me back.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.410
Hey. I think
I got something.

16:51.440 --> 16:53.363
This looks like some
kind of Grimm medical book.

16:54.640 --> 16:58.361
Date on it is 1917.

17:00.320 --> 17:01.481
You Okay?

17:01.560 --> 17:02.641
Yeah.

17:05.119 --> 17:06.963
Juliette and I are
having a little problem.

17:08.560 --> 17:09.766
You wanna talk about it?

17:11.400 --> 17:13.367
I'm still trying to
figure it out myself.

17:14.960 --> 17:16.290
Tell me what you got.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.723
Well, I think this is
what we're looking for.

17:19.800 --> 17:23.646
It's a Huntha Lami Muuaji.

17:24.560 --> 17:27.131
Some kind of wormy Wesen.

17:28.560 --> 17:33.566
"Much like the flatworm
Platyhelminthes, the epidermis of

17:33.640 --> 17:37.247
"the Huntha Lami Muuaji secretes
enzymes that feed on its host's skin."

17:37.360 --> 17:39.044
That sounds like our guy.

17:39.160 --> 17:41.322
This is kind of interesting.

17:41.440 --> 17:44.808
"Huntha Lami Muuaji always travel
in pairs, one female, one male.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.810
"But no female has ever been
captured or killed.

17:48.040 --> 17:49.565
"The males are
extremely dangerous.

17:49.640 --> 17:52.530
"Decapitation upon contact
is the best course to take.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.324
"Unlike other Wesen,

17:54.480 --> 17:56.562
"the Huntha Lami Muuaji
appear to have

17:56.640 --> 17:59.291
"only one Wesen state,
visible to all.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.487
"But whoever
has seen it has died.

18:02.640 --> 18:05.530
"Even Grimms have been especially
cautious in dealing with this Wesen

18:05.600 --> 18:09.321
"and the data recorded
by them is incomplete."

18:10.040 --> 18:11.530
So, we got a pair.

18:11.600 --> 18:14.331
Linus and the woman he's working with.
No ID on the woman.

18:14.520 --> 18:16.522
But she's the one
picking the guys up.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.083
And only one fingerprint in the room.
That's the guy's.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.611
So, where did the woman go?

18:22.400 --> 18:24.562
I think we better run this
by Monroe and Rosalee.

18:24.720 --> 18:26.085
Let's bring the book.

18:28.520 --> 18:29.760
Uh, it's Wu.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.167
Wu, what do you got?

18:32.480 --> 18:35.051
Got a hit on Toynbee's name
in the system.

18:35.120 --> 18:37.566
Apparently her credit card
was used to book an apartment

18:37.640 --> 18:39.369
three blocks away
from the condo.

18:39.520 --> 18:41.363
Well, then the suspects work
in the same neighborhood.

18:41.520 --> 18:42.806
Looks like.

18:42.880 --> 18:44.644
All right. Get a list of
all bars and restaurants

18:44.720 --> 18:46.006
that are within
walking distance.

18:46.080 --> 18:47.206
Already did.

18:47.360 --> 18:48.885
There's one that
caters to businessmen.

18:48.960 --> 18:52.203
It's called Olive or Twist.
Get it?

18:54.160 --> 18:55.685
We're headed to the Spice Shop.

18:55.760 --> 18:57.489
Let's regroup later.
Okay.

19:14.640 --> 19:16.005
Oh, this can't be good.

19:25.760 --> 19:26.921
Yeah?

19:27.000 --> 19:30.163
I slept in my car last night,
I'm not doing that again.

19:32.000 --> 19:33.764
All right, what do you mean?

19:35.240 --> 19:39.768
What I mean is,
I need a place to stay

19:39.840 --> 19:43.606
with somebody
who understands me.

19:44.480 --> 19:46.005
Oh. Uh...

19:47.200 --> 19:49.567
Look, I'm not sure this is
the best place for you.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.610
No, I can't go home until
I figure out what I am.

19:52.720 --> 19:54.563
Does Nick know where you are?

19:58.000 --> 19:59.081
No.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.520
You planning on telling him?

20:00.600 --> 20:01.806
I don't know.

20:02.440 --> 20:05.489
You realize this puts me in a
very awkward situation. Again.

20:05.720 --> 20:07.643
You wanna talk awkward?

20:08.160 --> 20:09.764
Listen, you have lived
with this your whole life.

20:09.840 --> 20:10.841
You know what it's like.

20:10.920 --> 20:13.491
I need to know what I'm
supposed to do to deal with it.

20:14.280 --> 20:17.204
Well, first off,
you need to be more careful.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.609
Obviously, most people
can't accept what we are.

20:19.680 --> 20:21.921
Reactions can be violent.

20:23.200 --> 20:24.440
Deadly, even.

20:24.520 --> 20:27.649
I mean, is there anything
comforting in all of this?

20:27.720 --> 20:30.121
Well, you do have abilities
that defy explanation.

20:30.680 --> 20:33.445
How you learn to use them will
determine what you become.

20:35.360 --> 20:36.805
But you are more
than I'll ever be.

20:36.920 --> 20:39.400
The way this happened to you...
You're one of a kind.

20:40.320 --> 20:43.324
Now, I don't know
what that means, ultimately.

20:48.320 --> 20:50.601
So, what you're saying is, I'm
just gonna have to wing it?

20:52.480 --> 20:53.606
Don't we all?

20:56.920 --> 20:58.524
I do have a favor to ask you.

20:59.520 --> 21:00.521
What?

21:02.160 --> 21:03.924
I need you to open a book.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.448
So, that's
a Huntha Lami Muuaji.

21:11.080 --> 21:12.764
Okay. So, what's the plan?

21:12.840 --> 21:14.763
How are you gonna
catch these varmints?

21:14.840 --> 21:17.730
Well, we think the woman's gonna
be at Olive or Twist tonight.

21:17.800 --> 21:19.404
Olive or Twist?
I love that place.

21:19.520 --> 21:21.682
Prices'll scare the "Dickens"
out of you, though.

21:22.000 --> 21:23.843
So, what, somebody
goes to the bar

21:23.920 --> 21:25.888
and tries to get picked up
by a pretty woman?

21:26.040 --> 21:27.326
Exactly.

21:27.400 --> 21:29.801
So, which one of you good-looking
guys is gonna be the bait?

21:29.880 --> 21:32.690
We'd like to use someone who
knows what they're up against.

21:37.920 --> 21:39.763
If Rosalee's okay with it.

21:41.520 --> 21:43.761
Well, I mean, as long as it
doesn't get out of hand.

21:45.320 --> 21:46.924
We'll be backing him up
the whole way.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.284
Stop it. Get it together.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.081
Hey.

22:38.600 --> 22:39.840
You all right?

22:40.760 --> 22:42.000
Yeah.

22:42.880 --> 22:44.325
Not really. I'm sorry.

22:45.320 --> 22:49.530
Anything you wanna,
you know, talk about?

22:50.880 --> 22:52.211
I don't know,

22:52.280 --> 22:54.886
my husband left me a week ago,

22:54.960 --> 22:58.282
so I'm still trying to figure
out what to do with myself.

22:59.520 --> 23:02.171
Oh, I'm sorry.
That's... That's tough.

23:04.600 --> 23:05.965
Let me buy you a drink.

23:07.840 --> 23:09.001
Okay.

23:09.080 --> 23:10.684
Excuse me, could we
get a cocktail menu?

23:14.480 --> 23:16.130
Pick your poison.

23:25.240 --> 23:26.287
Hey, yeah.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.567
So, I'm pretty sure
I made contact with our gal.

23:29.520 --> 23:32.091
She fits the description,
she says her name is Stacy.

23:32.160 --> 23:33.685
I don't know. I think
it's going pretty well,

23:33.760 --> 23:35.444
because she invited me
back to her place.

23:36.160 --> 23:37.764
You want me to
play this out or what?

23:37.840 --> 23:40.730
Well, you have to, so we can find
out if it's who we're looking for.

23:40.840 --> 23:42.080
Now, if she doesn't
go to the apartment,

23:42.160 --> 23:44.049
call it off.
She's not the right one.

23:44.120 --> 23:45.724
And you gotta be careful.
She could be

23:45.800 --> 23:47.370
a Huntha Lami Muuaji, too.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.525
Okay, look,
I gotta get back. Okay?

23:56.760 --> 23:59.491
All you have to do
is just cut yourself

23:59.560 --> 24:02.291
and then drip the blood
onto the book like this.

24:02.400 --> 24:05.563
Really? All I have to do is
cut myself and bleed for you?

24:05.680 --> 24:07.680
I've been doing a little
bleeding of my own lately.

24:08.840 --> 24:11.047
Why can't you do it again?
Aren't you half-Hexenbiest?

24:11.200 --> 24:12.920
Why does everybody
keep making that mistake?

24:13.000 --> 24:16.129
I am not a Hexenbiest, I'm a Zauberbiest.
There's a difference.

24:16.240 --> 24:17.401
How much blood?

24:18.160 --> 24:19.571
I don't know.
Just enough to

24:19.640 --> 24:20.926
open the book, whatever that is.

24:21.160 --> 24:22.730
Aren't you supposed
to be helping me?

24:22.920 --> 24:24.524
You get a place
to stay, don't you?

24:46.920 --> 24:47.921
Thank you.

24:49.360 --> 24:50.566
What is this book?

24:51.560 --> 24:52.925
It's the book that Adalind used

24:53.000 --> 24:54.604
to do what she
did to you and Nick.

24:55.120 --> 24:56.645
This I want to read.

25:00.640 --> 25:03.371
I don't know
if this is a good idea.

25:03.480 --> 25:06.290
Whatever you wanna do.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.607
I really don't want to be alone.

25:08.680 --> 25:10.762
Okay. We can just talk.

25:12.360 --> 25:13.521
Okay.

25:27.440 --> 25:31.001
I don't want to just talk,
unless we're talking dirty.

25:31.320 --> 25:32.367
Uh...

25:33.160 --> 25:34.400
Whoa!

25:46.720 --> 25:48.085
Oh, um...

25:55.680 --> 25:57.648
Don't move.

26:10.680 --> 26:11.886
Okay.

26:15.960 --> 26:17.240
Monroe and a woman just went in.

26:17.280 --> 26:18.850
Any sign of Linus?
No.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.251
I checked the apartment.
It was empty.

26:20.320 --> 26:21.970
And Linus has not
gone into the building.

26:22.320 --> 26:23.924
And there's only
one way in or out.

26:24.000 --> 26:25.764
All right. We have to wait
until Linus makes his move.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.524
We can't do anything
until he shows up.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.890
Be there in a second.

26:36.800 --> 26:38.006
Come on, guys.

26:38.560 --> 26:39.686
Oh, boy.

26:45.400 --> 26:46.765
Where's my wife?

26:47.160 --> 26:50.369
Uh, wife? Wait a minute.
She said you left her.

26:50.640 --> 26:53.371
Well, I didn't. I knew she was
seeing somebody and now I know who.

26:53.480 --> 26:55.448
Please, I've never
been here before.

26:55.520 --> 26:57.841
You've been sleeping with my wife?
I'm gonna kill you!

26:57.960 --> 26:59.450
No, no! No, no wait.
Please, no. I just...

26:59.520 --> 27:01.010
I'll give you anything you want.

27:01.080 --> 27:04.050
Whatever. My wallet. Anything.
Just, please... Look, let me go.

27:04.440 --> 27:05.566
What're you looking for?

27:05.640 --> 27:08.644
Nothing! I'm just... I'm scared
you're, you know, gonna shoot me!

27:09.160 --> 27:10.321
What are you doing?
Get away from the window!

27:10.440 --> 27:11.680
No, I got a cramp.

27:13.040 --> 27:14.610
Oh, crap.
Linus is in there.

27:14.680 --> 27:16.091
How'd he do that?

27:17.800 --> 27:19.643
Let me see your wallet.
I'm sorry, what?

27:19.720 --> 27:22.485
Don't argue with me,
give me your wallet.

27:22.560 --> 27:23.925
You got it.

27:31.640 --> 27:34.564
Twenty-two bucks? Is that all you've got?
Damn it, Stacy!

27:36.400 --> 27:37.401
Argh!

27:39.760 --> 27:41.091
It's him!
He's in the bedroom!

27:41.400 --> 27:43.004
Where's the woman?
In the bathroom!

27:43.160 --> 27:44.286
You all right?

27:49.080 --> 27:51.080
Don't let the woman get out,
I'm going after Linus.

28:59.840 --> 29:01.683
Hey, have you seen a guy run by?

29:01.800 --> 29:02.801
Mmm-mmm.

29:16.720 --> 29:18.085
I lost him.

29:18.360 --> 29:20.727
Where is she?
Well, she's not here.

29:20.840 --> 29:23.491
I'm telling you, she went into
the bathroom and never came out.

29:23.560 --> 29:25.289
Well, there's a door on the
other side of the bathroom.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.930
No clothes in the closet,
nothing.

29:27.000 --> 29:28.809
It's the same
setup as the condo.

29:28.880 --> 29:30.848
Now, she must have
left when Linus came in.

29:31.120 --> 29:33.009
- How'd she get past us?
- I don't know.

29:33.320 --> 29:34.560
Was she wearing these?

29:36.520 --> 29:37.646
Yeah.

29:38.440 --> 29:39.930
Where did you get these?

29:40.080 --> 29:41.491
Linus' coat.

29:42.960 --> 29:44.883
When I chased him,
he left it on the ground.

29:45.440 --> 29:46.771
I found these in the pocket.

29:46.960 --> 29:49.691
How the hell did her
earrings get into his pocket?

29:51.440 --> 29:52.680
What if she didn't go anywhere?

29:52.840 --> 29:54.960
Well, she had to go somewhere,
because she ain't here.

29:55.040 --> 29:57.520
The book says
the female is never found.

29:58.760 --> 30:00.046
What if they're the same person?

30:00.200 --> 30:01.520
You're saying,
what if this Wesen,

30:01.560 --> 30:05.246
this Huntha Lami Muuaji,
whatever, is both?

30:06.200 --> 30:08.806
Like, male and female?

30:09.880 --> 30:11.644
They can Woge
from one to the other?

30:11.720 --> 30:14.291
I'm just guessing, but that would
explain why the woman is never caught.

30:14.400 --> 30:17.085
And the Grimms always kill
the male when he Woges.

30:17.400 --> 30:19.721
That would explain why they
never find the female.

30:20.120 --> 30:21.600
Oh, that hurts
just thinking about it.

30:21.720 --> 30:25.691
That explains why she's got
no record, only Linus does.

30:26.200 --> 30:29.682
Okay, so how do we
find him, her, them?

30:31.240 --> 30:33.561
This is great,
Stacy, just great.

30:33.920 --> 30:36.201
I'm really not in the
mood for your crap right now.

30:36.680 --> 30:38.444
You've screwed us
good this time.

30:38.520 --> 30:40.568
We are not screwed.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.642
You really know how
to pick 'em, don't ya?

30:42.720 --> 30:45.087
I can't believe you brought
home a Blutbad with 22 bucks!

30:46.960 --> 30:48.530
I can't believe
you're such an idiot!

30:54.440 --> 30:57.046
Don't call me an idiot!
How was I supposed to know?

30:57.120 --> 31:01.603
You picked the bar! We can't
go anywhere for 22 bucks.

31:02.240 --> 31:05.449
We gotta do it again, but
this time, I pick the bar.

31:05.840 --> 31:07.604
Oh, and just so you know,

31:07.680 --> 31:09.125
I'm cutting my hair short again.

31:10.200 --> 31:13.249
So, the suspects you're after
are one and the same person?

31:13.320 --> 31:16.688
This Wesen sounds like the
epitome of an identity crisis.

31:17.080 --> 31:20.004
I can't even imagine how it must
feel to be both a man and a woman.

31:20.080 --> 31:21.491
Gotta be complicated.

31:21.560 --> 31:23.562
Yeah, and the problem is,

31:23.640 --> 31:26.211
after the Woge,
it looks like he or she

31:26.320 --> 31:29.164
can return to him or her.

31:29.280 --> 31:30.361
And we need the "he."

31:30.440 --> 31:32.080
Linus is the one
with the criminal record.

31:32.320 --> 31:33.890
So, you want to
lock him in the Linus?

31:33.960 --> 31:35.962
And prevent him from
turning into Stacy.

31:36.840 --> 31:40.242
Wait a minute. Forcing someone
to be one sex sounds like

31:40.320 --> 31:42.049
one of those
ethically ambiguous,

31:42.120 --> 31:44.771
morally gray-area
type situations.

31:44.880 --> 31:47.167
I'm just saying. The feminist
inside me is cringing.

31:47.280 --> 31:49.200
Cringe away, 'cause we
don't have another choice.

31:49.360 --> 31:51.010
And they're murderers.

31:51.320 --> 31:54.767
It sounds like the Woge is neutral
ground, hormonally speaking.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.729
So, I think that's your
moment of opportunity.

31:56.800 --> 31:58.450
But you're gonna
have to use something to

31:58.560 --> 32:00.722
keep him from turning
into Stacy mid-arrest.

32:00.800 --> 32:01.961
But can you even do that?

32:02.040 --> 32:03.121
I've never tried
anything like this before,

32:03.200 --> 32:06.488
but maybe something like
hormone therapy might work.

32:06.560 --> 32:08.164
Maybe giving him
a dose of testosterone,

32:08.280 --> 32:09.850
like how bodybuilders
use steroids.

32:09.920 --> 32:11.001
It's the same idea.

32:11.120 --> 32:13.560
You're gonna need a lot. This was
a pretty good-looking woman.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.922
Yeah,
but how much is too much?

32:16.000 --> 32:17.331
I don't know.

32:17.400 --> 32:18.481
Better to be on the safe side,

32:18.560 --> 32:20.280
especially if you want
to keep him as Linus.

32:20.320 --> 32:21.890
How do we inject him
with the hormones?

32:22.000 --> 32:23.764
I can make a pretty
potent batch of hormones.

32:23.840 --> 32:26.286
But you're gonna have to figure
out how to get it into him.

32:26.360 --> 32:27.850
You can't get too close
to this Wesen, remember?

32:27.920 --> 32:29.570
He's got flesh-eating slime.

32:29.640 --> 32:30.641
Dams

32:31.200 --> 32:32.770
Doppelarmbrust.

32:32.880 --> 32:34.370
Crossbow.
Perfect.

32:34.440 --> 32:35.441
Huh?

32:41.520 --> 32:45.127
Please. Please. Please.
Please. Please. Please.

32:45.200 --> 32:47.009
I can't go through this again.

32:49.960 --> 32:51.291
Oh, God.

32:56.440 --> 32:58.488
I can't have another baby!

32:59.800 --> 33:01.643
I don't even know
where the first one is!

33:04.200 --> 33:06.009
Okay, breathe.

33:06.760 --> 33:08.046
Breathe.

33:08.920 --> 33:11.764
I can do this. Just think.

33:15.000 --> 33:17.241
I'm gonna have to
find you another father.

33:18.400 --> 33:20.164
That's not going to be easy.

33:22.800 --> 33:25.883
I need to sleep
with somebody, fast.

33:26.520 --> 33:28.090
I adamantly
oppose this.

33:28.680 --> 33:31.081
Sir, we're making
real progress, here.

33:32.480 --> 33:33.641
Viktor.

33:33.920 --> 33:35.729
This is
a delicate situation.

33:35.800 --> 33:37.768
And if it falls
into the wrong hands...

33:39.240 --> 33:41.163
May I remind you
that nobody understands

33:41.240 --> 33:43.322
the complexity of
the situation like I do.

33:43.680 --> 33:47.810
And no one has exercised
as much patience as I have.

33:47.920 --> 33:49.763
I need more time.

33:50.480 --> 33:53.609
And you'll have
plenty, Viktor. In Vienna.

33:59.480 --> 34:02.324
Adalind, so nice
to see you again.

34:02.680 --> 34:03.806
Your Highness.

34:03.960 --> 34:05.803
You're looking lovely as ever.

34:06.080 --> 34:07.650
Is Viktor going somewhere?

34:07.720 --> 34:08.880
Yes.

34:09.280 --> 34:10.485
Am I leaving, too?

34:10.560 --> 34:12.483
No. You're staying here.

34:12.800 --> 34:13.880
Alone?

34:13.960 --> 34:15.246
No, dear.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.090
I would never leave you alone.

34:17.199 --> 34:19.168
You are far too important.

34:19.239 --> 34:21.971
Another member of the family
will be joining you soon.

34:22.120 --> 34:23.963
Will I get a chance
to say goodbye to Viktor?

34:24.080 --> 34:25.161
No.

34:27.480 --> 34:29.402
Will I ever see him again?

34:29.480 --> 34:31.402
Grown rather fond of him,
have you?

34:32.719 --> 34:35.121
We've just been
through so much together.

34:35.920 --> 34:38.241
Just so you know,

34:38.320 --> 34:39.969
I never really approved of him

34:40.040 --> 34:41.963
throwing you
in the dungeon like that.

34:42.960 --> 34:45.440
On the other hand,
you did betray the family

34:45.560 --> 34:48.005
by leaving Vienna
with the Resistance.

34:48.480 --> 34:50.208
I was so confused.

34:51.159 --> 34:53.003
The world is confused.

34:54.800 --> 34:59.283
People like the illusion of being
in control of their lives,

34:59.480 --> 35:04.008
but ultimately what they
crave is protection, safety.

35:04.760 --> 35:06.524
And none of that happens without

35:06.600 --> 35:08.329
a singular vision of the future.

35:09.120 --> 35:12.567
Your child has a very important
part to play in that future.

35:12.720 --> 35:14.529
She has royal blood.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.811
And we will get her
back where she belongs.

35:32.280 --> 35:35.170
Linus, you so wish
you could be me.

35:41.880 --> 35:42.961
A little more.

35:43.040 --> 35:45.520
What, are you trying to turn
this guy into a tyrannosaurus?

35:45.600 --> 35:47.364
A little more won't hurt.

35:47.440 --> 35:48.566
Got it.

35:48.640 --> 35:50.404
All right,
we're almost ready here.

35:51.480 --> 35:52.606
What's in the case?

35:52.680 --> 35:53.761
Our delivery system.

35:54.080 --> 35:55.844
Which should we use?

35:56.080 --> 36:00.244
The four inch, six, eight

36:00.360 --> 36:01.407
or the jumbo?

36:01.560 --> 36:03.927
Let's not take any chances.
Jumbo.

36:04.160 --> 36:06.080
All right, it's ready.
Let's fill it up.

36:07.600 --> 36:11.207
APB picked up Linus' car outside
Los Portales bar on Thurman.

36:11.360 --> 36:12.680
They've got it
under surveillance.

36:13.120 --> 36:14.770
Uh, let's pull the
surveillance once we get there.

36:14.880 --> 36:16.920
I don't want to have to
explain this to anyone else.

36:19.080 --> 36:20.366
I hope this works.

36:20.520 --> 36:22.443
Yeah, you and me both.

36:23.280 --> 36:24.486
Thanks for your help.

36:25.240 --> 36:26.730
Good luck, fellas.

36:29.080 --> 36:30.161
Phew!

36:30.360 --> 36:32.966
So, how pretty was she?

36:38.480 --> 36:40.642
You sure you want to hear
to my tales of woe?

36:40.760 --> 36:41.761
This is your last chance.

36:41.840 --> 36:44.764
Hey, I'm from Detroit.
I know woe.

36:44.840 --> 36:47.810
Well, then maybe
I should listen to you.

36:48.440 --> 36:49.805
My car's across the street.

36:50.360 --> 36:52.283
Oh, my place is really
close, we can just walk.

36:52.800 --> 36:55.246
Sir, sorry to interrupt,
but I need to see some ID.

36:55.960 --> 36:57.200
Uh, excuse me, why?

36:57.280 --> 36:59.123
You match the description
of a robbery suspect.

37:00.160 --> 37:01.491
Are you kidding me?

37:01.640 --> 37:04.723
Sir, if you don't cooperate, I'm afraid
I'll have to place you under arrest.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.290
Look, I don't know
what he's talking about.

37:06.360 --> 37:07.725
I had nothing to
do with anything.

37:07.800 --> 37:10.201
Sir, I need you to step away
from the woman. This way.

37:10.280 --> 37:11.520
This way.
This is unreal.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.282
This is outrageous!
I didn't do anything.

37:14.360 --> 37:16.169
Just take a second
to check your ID, sir.

37:17.520 --> 37:19.640
Can you please tell me what
I'm supposed to have done?

37:36.320 --> 37:37.560
Uh,
you dropped something.

37:43.080 --> 37:44.366
Hey, Stacy.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.251
Thought you might
want those back.

37:47.200 --> 37:49.521
Those aren't mine. I don't know
what you're talking about.

37:50.200 --> 37:51.850
Oh, then they must
belong to Linus?

37:53.200 --> 37:54.690
I'd like to talk to him.

37:56.200 --> 37:58.362
I don't know anyone named Linus.

37:58.480 --> 38:00.005
We think you do.

38:01.520 --> 38:02.806
You're not going anywhere.

38:02.880 --> 38:04.245
Game's over, Stacy.

38:04.640 --> 38:06.165
You got nothing on me.

38:06.400 --> 38:07.845
We know what you are.

38:08.040 --> 38:09.929
He's a Grimm,

38:10.000 --> 38:11.286
and you're a Huntha Lami Muuaji.

38:13.200 --> 38:14.611
I hope I pronounced that right.

38:14.760 --> 38:17.491
Well, if you know what I am,

38:17.560 --> 38:19.210
then you know what I can do.

38:39.000 --> 38:41.128
So, you think some little
darts are gonna stop me?

38:41.480 --> 38:42.766
Yeah, that was the plan.

38:48.800 --> 38:50.882
What is this?
What have you done?

38:55.000 --> 38:56.525
It's Linus.

38:58.600 --> 38:59.965
It worked!
Let's get him cuffed.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.080
Is this is the same person?

39:02.160 --> 39:03.924
Wearing the same dress.

39:04.520 --> 39:05.567
True.

39:05.640 --> 39:07.130
You have the right
to remain silent.

39:07.240 --> 39:08.685
Anything you say
can and will be used

39:08.760 --> 39:10.091
against you in a court of law.

39:10.320 --> 39:11.924
You have
the right to an attorney.

39:12.920 --> 39:14.649
It was just a simple con,
you know.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.290
There's nothing
simple about this con.

39:16.360 --> 39:18.249
You boast a pretty
lengthy criminal record,

39:18.320 --> 39:20.084
and Stacy's not
even in the system.

39:20.800 --> 39:23.087
You do all the dirty work
and she was your cover.

39:23.160 --> 39:24.969
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

39:25.040 --> 39:26.087
Somebody died.

39:26.160 --> 39:27.810
It just went wrong this time.

39:27.880 --> 39:30.042
We've never hurt anybody before,

39:30.120 --> 39:33.283
but that guy was waiting
for Stacy outside.

39:33.440 --> 39:34.726
And he grabbed her.

39:34.800 --> 39:39.124
And he was hurting her, really
hurting her and threatening her.

39:39.720 --> 39:41.484
That's what made me mad.

39:41.560 --> 39:43.801
I can't just stand by
and let that happen.

39:44.480 --> 39:47.723
I mean, this guy is
married with two kids.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.131
What kind of husband is he?

39:50.240 --> 39:52.402
And he's threatening
to call the police.

39:52.480 --> 39:55.689
I don't know, it just...
it all happened so fast.

39:56.160 --> 39:57.286
We didn't know what to do.

39:57.480 --> 39:59.403
You're going to jail, Linus.

40:00.320 --> 40:01.810
Don't you think
you've done enough?

40:18.560 --> 40:19.925
What did you do to her?

40:20.560 --> 40:22.130
What did you do to Stacy?

40:22.200 --> 40:24.487
I... I can't find her!

40:24.800 --> 40:27.929
You gave us no choice.
We couldn't arrest Stacy.

40:28.960 --> 40:30.849
I want her back.

40:30.920 --> 40:34.367
You don't understand.
We loved each other.

40:34.680 --> 40:35.761
Sit down.

40:40.280 --> 40:42.203
Love's got nothing
to do with what you did.

40:43.960 --> 40:45.689
Sign the confession.

40:47.560 --> 40:49.608
Oh, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no.

41:00.560 --> 41:02.005
Will I ever get her back?

41:03.040 --> 41:04.565
I don't know.

41:05.040 --> 41:08.044
Please. I need her.
I'll be all alone.

41:08.960 --> 41:10.166
Not where you're going.

41:10.560 --> 41:12.722
No. You could
never understand.

41:12.800 --> 41:15.007
We've been together
our whole lives!

41:16.160 --> 41:17.366
Please.

41:18.400 --> 41:19.970
Stacy, baby, I need you.

41:20.080 --> 41:22.526
I can't live without you.

41:23.480 --> 41:26.086
Stacy. Stacy.

41:44.120 --> 41:46.964
Oh, I get it.
Tradition.

41:47.520 --> 41:49.090
I'm trying
to tell you that I love you.

41:49.440 --> 41:51.204
Well, that's good.
Because I love you, too.

41:55.080 --> 41:56.445
What are you
doing here?

41:57.440 --> 41:59.886
I'm here for you, just like
you were there for me.

42:06.240 --> 42:07.401
I'm not going anywhere.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.321
Is this what you want to spend
the rest of your life with?
