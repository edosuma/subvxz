made commander of this place.

10:38.848 --> 10:41.323
Oh, Talon, none of
these men are gentlemen,

10:41.326 --> 10:43.685
and there is nothing
honorable at this table.

10:43.687 --> 10:45.153
Sit down.

10:46.790 --> 10:50.124
Right, uh, can someone
please explain the rules?

10:50.126 --> 10:52.823
It's simple. Each Octocard
has symbols and colors.

10:52.826 --> 10:55.226
There are six colors and five symbols.

10:55.229 --> 10:57.518
Maybe I should just sit out this one.

10:57.521 --> 10:59.021
I don't want to lose your money.

10:59.024 --> 11:02.091
Don't worry. I'll win
more than you lose.

11:02.094 --> 11:05.672
As I was saying, the
dealer deals the cards.

11:05.675 --> 11:09.799
Well, I was more than a
governess to Lady Calkussar.

11:09.802 --> 11:12.217
I taught her reading, sewing,

11:12.220 --> 11:15.415
the histories, languages, economics.

11:15.418 --> 11:20.521
That's quite an education for
a base commander's daughter.

11:20.523 --> 11:24.292
Master Calkussar was very
particular about her education.

11:24.294 --> 11:26.628
That's why they brought me out here,

11:26.630 --> 11:29.964
to make sure it was just as he desired.

11:29.966 --> 11:32.667
Really?

11:32.669 --> 11:35.737
That mustn't have come cheap.

11:35.739 --> 11:38.172
My price was fair.

11:38.174 --> 11:43.011
All those years with
Calkussar and his daughter,

11:43.013 --> 11:46.948
you must have seen things, heard things.

11:46.950 --> 11:51.853
Anything ever make you feel like
you were being kept from secrets?

11:51.855 --> 11:54.889
They were private people,

11:54.891 --> 11:57.825
if that's what you mean.

11:57.827 --> 12:01.029
I wasn't even permitted
to clean Gwynn's bedroom.

12:01.031 --> 12:03.865
She did all that herself.

12:03.867 --> 12:06.067
Is that so?

12:09.139 --> 12:11.739
Well, you've been most informative.

- Hmm.
- Hey.

30:08.470 --> 30:10.871
Does it mean something that can help us?

30:11.783 --> 30:14.173
What it means is that the injected venom

30:14.176 --> 30:16.067
must contain the larvae
that then develops

30:16.070 --> 30:18.064
into the fully-formed parasite, but,
