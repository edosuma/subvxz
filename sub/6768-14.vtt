Thanks.

{\an1}The club's jammed,
the band's crankin'.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.497
What's with the attitude?
You know what?

00:39.581 --> 00:41.291
I work the crowds,
I book the bands,

00:41.374 --> 00:42.459
and now I'm bartending,

00:42.542 --> 00:44.461
and you get 90%
of the profits.

00:44.544 --> 00:46.296

lousy one.

00:47.464 --> 00:48.965
Yeah, one you agreed to.

00:49.048 --> 00:51.092
{\an1}Besides, you're making
good tips.

Emma. You here

{\an6}Just dropping off

Ah.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.480
Hi. Sit down. Hang out.

01:03.563 --> 01:04.980
{\an1}She's probably got
somewhere to go,

01:05.063 --> 01:06.316
Kel.
Ooh, can I have

01:06.399 --> 01:07.776
a sneak preview?

01:07.859 --> 01:09.319
I can't believe your friend
slept with that guy

01:09.402 --> 01:10.987
even though he was still
with his girlfriend.

01:11.070 --> 01:12.071
That is so low.

01:12.155 --> 01:14.783
Well, then you'll definitely
enjoy this installment.

01:14.866 --> 01:16.534
He gets her into bed

of course, conveniently
regrets it.

{\an1}Uh, it's probably
the band's last set.

01:27.420 --> 01:28.463
{\an6}We should get
out of here.
Okay.

01:28.546 --> 01:30.215
{\an3}Yeah, me, too.

retrofitting my place.

they turned the power off.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.809
They didn't notify you?

05:51.893 --> 05:54.270
Well, it turns out they sent
a form weeks ago,

05:54.353 --> 05:55.605
when my mom was
handling the mail.

05:55.688 --> 05:58.107

that looks like junk mail.

Well, do you want
to stay with me?

06:03.863 --> 06:05.406

on the sofa.

06:05.490 --> 06:07.408
Oh, that's really sweet,

06:07.492 --> 06:08.785

it's a little confusing

06:08.868 --> 06:10.286

people.

06:10.369 --> 06:12.622
Well, you guys can stay with me.

Oh, don't give it
a second thought.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.626
Give me a call later
and I'll give you the key.

06:16.709 --> 06:17.668

06:38.523 --> 06:40.441

{\an3}Can you set
a fracture?

06:42.068 --> 06:43.319
Suture a wound?

06:43.402 --> 06:45.321
{\an3}Can you tell if someone's
bleeding internally?

06:45.404 --> 06:46.322
No.

06:46.405 --> 06:47.365
Then who do you think's

06:47.448 --> 06:49.367
more important
to this clinic?

06:49.450 --> 06:51.160
{\an3}You? Or me?

06:51.244 --> 06:53.162
Remember that

06:53.246 --> 06:55.331
{\an3}the next time you consider
reporting my behavior

06:55.414 --> 06:57.333
to Audrey Cutler.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.377
{\an1}You think I wouldn't
find out?

06:59.460 --> 07:01.462
I thought I was speaking to her
in confidence.

07:01.546 --> 07:03.047
Word gets out.

07:03.131 --> 07:04.465
Maybe you should take that
into account

07:04.549 --> 07:06.175
next time you're dealing
with female colleagues.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.969
You want to take me on?

07:08.052 --> 07:09.470
Go ahead.

07:09.554 --> 07:11.514
You win, I go into private
practice and quadruple

07:11.597 --> 07:13.307
{\an4}my income.
There's nothing
keeping you here.

07:13.391 --> 07:14.517
Just the patients.

07:14.600 --> 07:17.353
So I offend your delicate
sensibilities.

07:17.436 --> 07:19.689
You get me out of here, someone
less competent takes over,

07:19.772 --> 07:21.232
and as a result someone dies.

07:21.315 --> 07:23.776
{\an1}Congratulations,

07:34.829 --> 07:36.747
{\an4}MAN:

bring it in.

07:36.831 --> 07:38.875

another hour?

07:43.963 --> 07:45.047
{\an1}David,

07:45.131 --> 07:46.883
{\an1}sorry we didn't know
this was your car wash.

07:46.966 --> 07:48.759
It's not mine, I just work here.

07:48.843 --> 07:50.761
{\an3}So what can we do
for you today?

07:50.845 --> 07:52.180
{\an3}We have a ten dollar
special,

07:52.263 --> 07:53.347
a free hot wax.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.557
Fine.

08:00.104 --> 08:01.480
This was an accident.

08:01.564 --> 08:03.065
Really?

08:03.149 --> 08:04.358
I thought maybe you guys
just rolled

08:04.442 --> 08:06.235
out of bed and decided
to get your car washed

08:06.319 --> 08:07.236
{\an1}and rub my nose
in it.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.114
{\an3}What is that
supposed to mean?

08:10.198 --> 08:13.242
You made me wait seven years
before you slept with me.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.244
You haven't even made Noah wait

08:15.328 --> 08:16.245
seven weeks.

08:16.329 --> 08:18.372
{\an1}Look, I don't know what
you're talking about,

08:18.456 --> 08:20.208
but you really are in no
position to criticize me,

08:20.291 --> 08:22.043
{\an1}the way you flaunt
your sex life with Valerie.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.127
{\an3}Oh, Valerie and I aren't
sleeping together.

08:23.211 --> 08:25.379
Well, everyone at the Walsh
house heard you guys...

08:25.463 --> 08:27.215
No, they heard
us faking it.

08:27.298 --> 08:29.217
{\an3}We were just doing it to make
you and Noah jealous.

08:29.300 --> 08:31.260
{\an3}All right, it was stupid.
Let's just drop it.

08:31.344 --> 08:33.261
I didn't know.

08:33.346 --> 08:35.264
David....

08:35.347 --> 08:37.265
You okay here?

08:37.350 --> 08:39.268
{\an3}Yeah, fine.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.395
{\an1}All right.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.486
So, it's true that I don't
have a lot of experience.

08:48.569 --> 08:51.113
But I know computer layout,
and I'm good with graphics,

08:51.197 --> 08:52.740
{\an3}and I'm a real quick study.
Uh-huh.

08:52.823 --> 08:54.450
{\an1}No kidding.
Yeah, small presses,

08:54.533 --> 08:55.952
you know, I really believe
in them.

08:56.035 --> 08:58.287
Massive circulation
and fancy offices--

08:58.371 --> 08:59.288
they don't impress me.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.998
{\an1}Well, that's very good.
You know,

09:01.082 --> 09:01.958
{\an3}I always root for
the underdog.

09:02.041 --> 09:05.294
I like to be able to smell
the desperation

09:05.378 --> 09:06.170
{\an1}and desire
on the page.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.255
She can smell it?

09:07.338 --> 09:09.090
Is it that obvious,

09:09.173 --> 09:10.549
{\an1}Janet?
No, no, I meant,

09:10.633 --> 09:12.635
you know, you must be rewriting
just up to publication.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.803
Which is okay with me.

09:13.886 --> 09:15.346
Because I don't mind
redoing a layout

09:15.429 --> 09:16.430
if it keeps the paper fresh.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.474
{\an1}You know,
on the cutting edge.

09:18.557 --> 09:20.476
I'm sorry, you'll have
to excuse us.

09:20.559 --> 09:23.312
We're not used to people
sucking up to us.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.189
But that doesn't mean
you should stop.

09:25.273 --> 09:26.148
Oh, no, no, no, please continue.

09:26.232 --> 09:28.359
Well, look, I just--
I really want this job.

09:28.442 --> 09:29.151
You can work me day,

09:29.235 --> 09:30.695
{\an1}night, weekends,
holidays, whatever,

09:30.778 --> 09:31.821
{\an3}I don't care.
I will give you

09:31.904 --> 09:34.198
110 percent.

09:34.282 --> 09:36.325
More if you need it.

09:37.576 --> 09:38.828
You got it.

09:38.911 --> 09:39.954
Are you serious?

09:40.037 --> 09:40.746
Yeah.

09:41.747 --> 09:42.873
Nobody else applied.

09:42.957 --> 09:44.875
{\an1}Oh.
Steve,

09:44.959 --> 09:46.335
maybe we should've held back
that information

09:46.419 --> 09:48.004
until we negotiated salary.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.339
Oh, don't worry, I'll be gentle.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.966
{\an3}Thank you.
So what happened

09:52.049 --> 09:53.175
to the last production manager?

09:53.259 --> 09:54.802
Eloped. Just like that.

09:54.885 --> 09:55.678
{\an3}Did not

09:55.761 --> 09:57.847
even invite us
to the wedding ceremony.

09:57.930 --> 10:00.099
{\an5}Do you believe that?
Should've kept her away
from the classifieds.

10:00.182 --> 10:01.350
Can you start tomorrow?

10:01.434 --> 10:02.184
Yeah, sure thing.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.352
{\an3}Great.
Great.

10:03.436 --> 10:04.437
Welcome aboard.

10:06.355 --> 10:09.358
{\an3}Brandon, it's customary
to shake hands

10:09.442 --> 10:10.609
when you close a deal here.

10:10.693 --> 10:12.028
Oh, yeah, right.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.113
{\an1}Welcome.

10:15.531 --> 10:17.825
Emma, I'm sorry about the watch.

10:17.908 --> 10:19.201
{\an1}I didn't give it
to Kelly.

10:19.285 --> 10:20.369
Oh, no?

10:20.453 --> 10:21.412
What, she just took it?

10:21.495 --> 10:23.372
Yeah, basically.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.166
Well, did you say, "Look, Kel.

10:25.249 --> 10:26.375
"The woman I made love to

10:26.459 --> 10:27.835
gave this to me?"

10:27.918 --> 10:29.211
{\an3}What, and she liked
it so much

10:29.295 --> 10:31.005
that she didn't care
where it came from?

10:31.088 --> 10:32.089
No.

10:32.173 --> 10:34.592
So you're the one who didn't
care where it came from.

10:35.634 --> 10:37.553
Look, Emma, I'm sorry.

10:37.636 --> 10:39.555
About everything.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.557
But this isn't going
anywhere good.

10:41.640 --> 10:44.060
And us working together is
only making things worse.

10:44.143 --> 10:47.021
I know, I just--

10:47.104 --> 10:48.939
I just wanted us to--

10:49.023 --> 10:51.567
If you would just...
I'm not going to.

10:53.319 --> 10:54.862
I think you should leave
the paper.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.614
{\an3}Hi.

10:56.697 --> 10:58.115
{\an5}Hey.
Kel.
Hey.

10:58.199 --> 11:00.201
{\an3}Oh, I have had the
worst morning.

11:00.284 --> 11:01.577
Oh, you poor thing.

11:01.660 --> 11:03.579
You know that doctor
I told you about, Monahan?

11:03.662 --> 11:06.374
Well, I didn't officially
report him,

11:06.457 --> 11:07.500
{\an3}but he found out...
Let's-let's go somewhere.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.919
If I don't quit, he's gonna make
my life a living hell.

11:10.002 --> 11:12.254
Kel, I want you
away from him.

11:12.338 --> 11:13.547
{\an1}But I don't think you should
run away from this.

11:13.631 --> 11:14.757
{\an4}EMMA:
I couldn't
agree more.

11:14.840 --> 11:17.593
You know, any boss who even
hints that you should leave,

11:17.676 --> 11:19.261
{\an3}because he made sexual
advances at you,

11:19.345 --> 11:21.263
wanted or unwanted, is a jerk.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.556
She's right.

11:22.640 --> 11:24.266
You shouldn't let yourself
be victimized.

11:24.350 --> 11:25.267
{\an1}EMMA:
Exactly.

11:25.351 --> 11:26.435
If I were you,

11:26.519 --> 11:28.270
I would stay right
where you are.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.397
Right, Brandon?

11:37.321 --> 11:38.781
They were faking?

11:38.864 --> 11:40.157
Did you ask why?

11:40.241 --> 11:41.951
{\an3}Trying to make
us jealous.

11:42.034 --> 11:42.952
{\an3}Ah.

11:43.035 --> 11:46.247
I wonder whose idea that was.

11:46.330 --> 11:47.581
BOTH:
Valerie.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.376
So when do you have
to be at the club?

11:50.459 --> 11:52.044
Oh, I'm not going
to work tonight.

11:54.046 --> 11:56.966
You're not gonna leave Valerie
in charge, are you?

11:57.049 --> 11:58.801
She can handle it.

11:58.884 --> 12:00.928
Are you free tonight?

12:02.721 --> 12:06.392
Actually, no, I'm not.

12:07.393 --> 12:08.936
Are you still working
on your presentation?

12:09.019 --> 12:11.939
{\an1}Yeah, you know, I want
to get that job.

12:12.022 --> 12:13.649
And that's all
it is, right?

12:13.732 --> 12:15.651
{\an3}'Cause I'm starting to sense
this pattern, Donna.

12:15.734 --> 12:18.487
{\an3}I know how much you want
the job and all,

12:18.571 --> 12:20.489
{\an5}but I can't help feeling
we haven't...
What?

12:20.573 --> 12:23.284
Slept together?

12:23.367 --> 12:24.869
Yeah.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.329
David's the only guy that
I have ever slept with,

12:27.413 --> 12:30.875
{\an1}and we waited
a really long time,

12:30.958 --> 12:34.003
until I felt that
we were truly committed.

12:35.254 --> 12:38.674
And then it all just
fell apart on me.

12:38.757 --> 12:42.553
So, I guess that I just
need a little more time

12:42.636 --> 12:43.637
to find my way...

12:43.721 --> 12:45.514
Past David, right?

12:45.598 --> 12:48.142
No, that's not it.

12:48.225 --> 12:49.393
Are you sure?

12:49.477 --> 12:52.313
Yes.

13:09.955 --> 13:11.957
Can-can you unzip me?

13:12.958 --> 13:15.044
There's no zipper.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.087
Well, just take it off.

13:17.171 --> 13:18.714
(laughs)

13:18.797 --> 13:20.257
{\an3}No, I'll let you do
the grunt work.

13:20.341 --> 13:22.384
{\an3}I did enough today
at the car wash.

13:24.678 --> 13:25.721
You know what?

13:25.804 --> 13:27.223
I wasn't talking
about faking it.

13:27.306 --> 13:29.850
{\an1}You know, when you kissed me
on Christmas Eve...

13:29.934 --> 13:31.769
it felt real.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.229
It was really nice.

13:33.312 --> 13:35.356
And we've been sleeping
in the same bed together...

13:35.439 --> 13:37.566
{\an3}No, you've been
sleeping.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.110
I've been wide awake. You think
this has been easy for me?

13:40.194 --> 13:42.571
{\an1}How much easier
can I make this for you?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.907
Val, after a long day of
working at the car wash,

13:44.990 --> 13:46.242
I have to come home to you,

13:46.325 --> 13:48.577
{\an3}knowing all you want
is some guy like Noah.

13:48.661 --> 13:49.954
I don't want Noah.

13:50.037 --> 13:53.082
Sorry, some variation
of the rich guy thing.

13:53.165 --> 13:56.126
{\an1}Well, at least you give me
credit for variety.

13:56.210 --> 13:58.295
I saw the way you looked
at Donna last night.

13:58.379 --> 14:02.299
How's it make you feel knowing
she's going home with Noah, huh?

14:02.383 --> 14:04.426
Awful.

14:08.305 --> 14:10.015
Good. You know what?

14:10.099 --> 14:11.934
That's exactly the way you just
made me feel right now.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.102
Val, I'm sorry, okay.

14:13.185 --> 14:14.603
{\an3}You gotta understand.
I was with Donna

14:14.687 --> 14:16.272
for a long time.
I loved her.

14:16.355 --> 14:19.233
And now I've gotta sit around
watching Noah run my club.

14:19.316 --> 14:20.234
Sleeping with your girlfriend.

14:20.317 --> 14:21.944
Exactly.

14:22.027 --> 14:22.987
{\an1}Wrong.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.822
See, she's your ex-girlfriend.

14:26.865 --> 14:28.784
Maybe I'd feel better
about this whole thing

14:28.867 --> 14:31.161
if I wasn't working
at a stinking car wash,

14:31.245 --> 14:33.414
and-and I had my own place
to live.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.040
What do you want me to do?

14:35.124 --> 14:35.958
I'm letting you live here.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.876
Thanks a lot for your charity,
all right,

14:37.960 --> 14:40.379
but I-I've had enough.

14:49.722 --> 14:51.432
♪ ♪

14:55.394 --> 14:57.438
(car horn honking)

15:01.066 --> 15:02.484
{\an3}Whoa, what are you
guys doing here?

15:02.568 --> 15:03.861
I'm working.
Wrong, David,

15:03.944 --> 15:04.987
you're dying here.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.197
{\an5}Which is why we've come
to rescue you.
That's right.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.991
Look, I'm gonna get in trouble

15:09.074 --> 15:10.534
unless you guys need a detail
or something.

15:10.618 --> 15:13.162
{\an3}David, we need you
at <i> the Beat.</i>

15:13.245 --> 15:14.163
Consider this
a job offer.

15:14.246 --> 15:16.165
{\an3}We want you to do album
and concert reviews,

15:16.248 --> 15:18.000
{\an3}cover the whole music scene,
what do you say?

15:18.083 --> 15:19.335
We'll double your salary.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.836
{\an5}Not including tips
of course.
Think about it.

15:20.919 --> 15:22.338
{\an1}You can give up
that carnauba wax,

15:22.421 --> 15:24.673
go back to real hair gel.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.008
I'm not a writer.

15:26.091 --> 15:27.176
It's not writing
the story, David,

15:27.259 --> 15:28.218
it's knowing
the subject.

15:28.302 --> 15:29.803
{\an4}STEVE:
Say yes.
Come on,

15:29.887 --> 15:31.555
{\an1}say yes. Y-E-S,
Say it.

15:31.639 --> 15:33.557
{\an1}one little word's gonna
make us very happy.

15:33.641 --> 15:35.225
Who are you guys?

15:37.603 --> 15:38.812
My new bosses.

15:38.896 --> 15:40.314
I quit.

15:40.397 --> 15:41.523
{\an1}STEVE:
Whoo-hoo!

15:42.608 --> 15:43.901
(tires squealing)

15:46.236 --> 15:47.988
Hi. Is Dr. Monahan in?

15:48.072 --> 15:50.032
In his office.

15:50.115 --> 15:52.326
{\an3}Not someone from the
Foundation again.

15:52.409 --> 15:54.036
No, but, uh...

15:54.119 --> 15:55.537
Kelly.

15:55.621 --> 15:57.581
{\an1}This is Lisa Gaines.
Your replacement.

15:57.665 --> 15:58.957
Excuse me?

15:59.041 --> 16:00.459
It killed me when she resigned.

16:00.542 --> 16:01.710
She may look petite,

16:01.794 --> 16:03.879
but you've got big shoes
to fill.

16:03.962 --> 16:05.881
Well, I'll do my best.

16:05.964 --> 16:07.383
Good luck on your new job.

16:09.426 --> 16:10.386
{\an3}Bye.
I'll see you, Lisa.

16:16.934 --> 16:18.394
{\an3}I can't believe
you did this.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.229
{\an1}Frankly, I'm surprised
you're here.

16:20.312 --> 16:21.063
I wanted to help people.

16:21.146 --> 16:22.022
I believed in what
you were doing.

16:22.106 --> 16:25.609
I'll mention that
in my recommendation.

16:25.693 --> 16:27.361
I'm filing a formal complaint.

16:30.614 --> 16:32.241
I started this clinic.

16:32.324 --> 16:33.575
I am this clinic.

16:33.659 --> 16:35.244
We get funding
because the board

16:35.327 --> 16:37.579
at the Wyatt Foundation
believes in <i> me.</i>

16:37.663 --> 16:40.124
If what you've built is ruined,
it's nobody's fault

16:40.207 --> 16:41.375
but your own.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.876
I'm not gonna let
you run me out of here.

16:42.960 --> 16:45.879
No?

16:45.963 --> 16:47.965
{\an1}Try this.

16:50.134 --> 16:51.427
You're fired.

16:59.518 --> 17:00.811
Oh, hey, Nat.

17:00.894 --> 17:02.604
Hey, hey.

17:02.688 --> 17:03.605
What's this?

17:03.689 --> 17:05.232
{\an1}Oh, it's for you--
new theme night.

17:05.315 --> 17:06.733
Sports Night at the After Dark.

17:06.817 --> 17:07.901
Everybody's going to be there

17:07.984 --> 17:09.111
and Noah's going
to make tons of money.

17:09.194 --> 17:11.613
Patience, Val.

17:11.696 --> 17:12.656
There's no shortcut
to being rich.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.324
Unless you're born with it.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.329
What's he doing here?

17:21.373 --> 17:22.458
Who is he?

17:22.540 --> 17:26.044
Duke Weatherill,
Brandon's old bookie.

17:32.009 --> 17:33.343
How's it going, Nat?

17:33.427 --> 17:35.137
{\an3}Two to one

17:35.220 --> 17:37.306
I know which you sell more,
cake or pie.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.141
The only action
you're gonna see here

17:39.224 --> 17:41.310
is scrambled, over easy
or sunny side up.

17:41.393 --> 17:43.395
Yeah, I can see that.

17:50.694 --> 17:52.529
The nightclub
is her business, not mine.

17:52.613 --> 17:54.573
Maybe I should talk to her then.

17:56.074 --> 17:57.367
Stay away from her.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.496
For old time's sake.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.081
Sure... for old time's sake.

18:06.376 --> 18:08.295
DONNA:
<i>Okay, what should we pack next?</i>

18:08.378 --> 18:10.839
Uh, you want
to pack the bathroom?

18:10.923 --> 18:12.925
{\an1}Okay.

18:14.343 --> 18:15.177
Oh, you know what?

18:15.260 --> 18:17.304
I've got all this stuff
in my apartment...

18:17.387 --> 18:20.849
except these.

18:20.933 --> 18:23.227
Yours?

18:23.310 --> 18:24.812
Well, they're for Steve, but...

18:24.895 --> 18:26.897
{\an6}Okay, can I ask
you a question?
Mm-hmm.

18:26.980 --> 18:29.483
Have you guys... right.

18:29.566 --> 18:32.653
Duh, obviously you have,
but when did you...?

18:32.736 --> 18:34.530
Have sex?
Mm-hmm.

18:34.613 --> 18:36.532
When the time was right.

18:36.615 --> 18:38.367
Yeah, but how'd you know?

18:38.450 --> 18:40.202
Steve looked
at me, and...

18:40.285 --> 18:43.205
I remember looking like hell.

18:43.288 --> 18:46.542
But you could see that
he wasn't seeing that.

18:46.625 --> 18:50.879
And, um, I just couldn't take
my eyes or my hands off him.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.965
And it was, I don't know,
it was just time.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.678
You know, at first I thought
you had to be married.

18:57.761 --> 19:00.055
And then I thought
it was okay as long as it was

19:00.138 --> 19:02.808
the guy you were
going to marry, and now...

19:02.891 --> 19:04.226
The rules keep changing.

19:04.309 --> 19:06.395
It's so confusing.

19:06.478 --> 19:08.230
If you're not sure,

19:08.313 --> 19:09.731
you're not ready.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.234
{\an1}Yeah, but "sure" of what?
That you can

19:12.317 --> 19:14.903
give yourself to this person
and he'll do the same.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.530
Don't worry.

19:16.613 --> 19:18.115
{\an1}You'll know
before it's too late.

19:18.198 --> 19:20.200
I mean, you don't need
to be in bed with each other

19:20.284 --> 19:21.577
{\an1}to feel
the difference.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.335
(jazz music playing on radio)

19:36.300 --> 19:38.218
Hey.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.220
{\an1}Hey.

19:40.304 --> 19:42.306
Uh, shift over at the car wash?

19:42.389 --> 19:43.640
No, I'm done for good.

19:43.724 --> 19:45.267
I quit.
(radio clicks off)

19:45.350 --> 19:47.394
Wow, it's about time.

19:48.562 --> 19:50.272
What pushed you over the edge?

19:50.355 --> 19:52.482
I mean, assuming that
you needed one?

19:52.566 --> 19:56.445
Well, actually Brandon and Steve
want me to work up at the <i> Beat.</i>

19:56.528 --> 19:57.946
I'm their new music guy.

19:58.030 --> 19:59.740
Wow, that's great.

19:59.823 --> 20:02.367
You guys'll have
a lot of fun together.

20:02.451 --> 20:04.161
Yeah.

20:04.244 --> 20:06.246
Plus they gave me
enough of a cash advance

20:06.330 --> 20:08.290
where I can start, uh,

20:08.373 --> 20:10.125
thinking about
getting my own place.

20:10.208 --> 20:11.793
So I think I'm going
to move out.

20:15.088 --> 20:16.423
Is that what you want?

20:16.506 --> 20:19.468
Yeah, I think so.

20:20.719 --> 20:22.054
Or is it Donna?

20:24.056 --> 20:27.684
No. No, it's...

20:29.895 --> 20:32.272
It's you.

20:32.356 --> 20:33.982
{\an1}I love spending
time with you

20:34.066 --> 20:36.109
{\an1}and we've been getting along
great, I'm just afraid

20:36.193 --> 20:38.987
that maybe we have a little too
much of a history, you know?

20:40.405 --> 20:43.659
{\an1}And I'm also afraid of
dealing with another shock.

20:43.742 --> 20:47.162
Yes, David,
you, you fell down.

20:47.245 --> 20:49.331
You lost a job

20:49.414 --> 20:50.457
and a girlfriend.

20:50.540 --> 20:52.334
But you didn't whine

20:52.417 --> 20:53.794
and you didn't quit.

20:53.877 --> 20:55.671
I'm really proud of you.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.173
I can't believe
you're saying this.

20:58.256 --> 20:59.508
You've fought
your way back.

20:59.591 --> 21:02.177
{\an3}I mean, you took a crappy
job because...

21:02.260 --> 21:05.222
it's one step.

21:05.305 --> 21:08.392
And I really respect that.

21:10.227 --> 21:12.020
I do.

21:15.899 --> 21:17.442
I'm still moving out.

21:17.526 --> 21:20.529
If that's what you,
if that's what you want.

21:22.990 --> 21:25.367
'Cause you see, I just...
I just can't trust you.

21:25.450 --> 21:26.368
{\an3}Yeah...

21:26.451 --> 21:28.412
{\an1}I'm such a terrible person.
You know, there's,

21:28.495 --> 21:30.372
there's still
people downstairs.

21:30.455 --> 21:31.832
They're not going
to hear anything

21:31.915 --> 21:33.959
{\an3}that they haven't
heard before.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.719
He actually fired you?

21:43.802 --> 21:45.679
Loaded, aimed and fired.

21:45.762 --> 21:47.222
{\an3}But that was
only round one.

21:47.305 --> 21:49.349
{\an1}You should sue
him to the wall.

21:49.433 --> 21:51.059
{\an3}I would settle for
keeping my job

21:51.143 --> 21:52.853
and finding somebody
to replace him.

21:55.022 --> 21:56.106
The water's almost boiling.

21:56.189 --> 21:57.149
{\an1}Should I start
the pasta?

21:57.232 --> 21:59.359
{\an3}Yeah, sure, uh, as soon
as Brandon gets home.

22:01.820 --> 22:05.115
Well, I'll use this
to time it when it's ready.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.451
This is a man's watch.

22:07.534 --> 22:09.661
{\an3}Did you realize that?
Yeah, that's why I like it.

22:09.745 --> 22:11.246
It's not so dressy, you know?

22:11.329 --> 22:13.540
Sometimes the most everyday
present can mean the most.

22:13.623 --> 22:14.374
Well, I'm sure

22:14.458 --> 22:16.543
that was the intention
of the gift.

22:16.626 --> 22:19.087
Hello. Is anybody home?

22:19.171 --> 22:21.173
Speak of the devil.

22:22.340 --> 22:23.550
{\an1}KELLY:
Hi.

22:23.633 --> 22:24.760
Hey, how you doing, baby?

22:24.843 --> 22:26.511
{\an1}Good, how are you?
Good.

22:33.602 --> 22:34.561
Oh, no!

22:34.644 --> 22:36.063
Kelly!

22:36.146 --> 22:37.814
Who's that?

22:40.650 --> 22:43.403
I don't, I'm...
I had the watch

22:43.487 --> 22:44.821
{\an4}in one hand
and the pasta
in the other.

22:44.905 --> 22:46.656
{\an1}I don't know
how it happened.

22:46.740 --> 22:47.908
Oh, it's broken.

22:47.991 --> 22:49.159
{\an1}Oh, Kelly,
it was an accident.

22:49.242 --> 22:50.660
I'm so sorry.

22:50.744 --> 22:52.120
Brandon, where'd you get it?

22:52.204 --> 22:54.498
Don't worry about it.
I'll take care of it.

22:54.581 --> 22:56.291
Well, I want to replace it.

22:56.375 --> 22:57.793
I'll do it.

22:57.876 --> 23:00.128
{\an1}Just tell me
where you got it.

23:00.212 --> 23:02.130
Brandon, if she wants to...

23:02.214 --> 23:05.175
I don't remember, okay?

23:05.258 --> 23:06.635
Well, you just got it
for Christmas.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.595
Yeah, I know, I just, uh...

23:08.678 --> 23:11.014
I can't remember right now,
but I will.

23:11.098 --> 23:12.974
{\an1}Well, you let me know
the minute you do.

23:13.058 --> 23:14.935
I'm kind of a stickler
for payback.

23:28.073 --> 23:29.366
CARLY:
<i>Is that Donna's apartment?</i>

23:29.449 --> 23:31.660
{\an3}Yep.
Ooh, you did a good job,

23:31.743 --> 23:33.328
{\an3}sweetie.
Can I draw

23:33.411 --> 23:34.788
{\an3}something else?
Sure.

23:34.871 --> 23:36.665
I'll get you some more paper
out of my sketchbook.

23:36.748 --> 23:38.792
(Carly and Zach chat quietly)

23:45.298 --> 23:49.177
That's someone
that's on the top...

23:49.261 --> 23:50.512
Here you go, Zach man.

23:50.595 --> 23:52.681
{\an3}CARLY:
Zach, honey,

23:52.764 --> 23:55.684
{\an6}are you ever going
to get off this bed?
No.

23:55.767 --> 23:56.726
Well, that's all right.

23:56.810 --> 23:57.519
There's no rush.

23:57.602 --> 23:59.229
Of course,
unless you want dessert.

23:59.312 --> 24:01.356
Peanut butter swirl!

24:01.439 --> 24:04.192
Yeah!
There's berries in the fridge.

24:04.276 --> 24:06.319
{\an1}Oh, berries--
I love berries on ice cream.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.363
<i>Instead</i> of ice crea.

24:08.446 --> 24:09.823
(groans)

24:09.906 --> 24:11.116
(whispers):
Berries on ice cream.

24:14.911 --> 24:17.038
{\an3}You know, Donna, I really
want to thank you.

24:17.122 --> 24:19.374
You have no idea
how much this helps me.

24:19.457 --> 24:21.793
Oh, likewise, thank you
for the advice

24:21.877 --> 24:23.086
about Noah...

24:23.170 --> 24:24.087
who I have to go meet

24:24.171 --> 24:26.214
right about now
at the Peach Pit After Dark.

24:26.298 --> 24:27.883
{\an6}STEVE:
Hey, Donna any more
chocolate syrup?

24:27.966 --> 24:31.219
Um, yeah, on the door
in the fridge.

24:31.303 --> 24:32.804
{\an3}I hope you don't
mind, I have

24:32.888 --> 24:34.723
to go to work tonight,
but I have a sitter for Zach.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.391
Uh, she's 16 and completely
responsible.

24:36.474 --> 24:37.642
Okay.

24:37.726 --> 24:40.103
Why is Shauna coming here?
I'm available.

24:40.187 --> 24:41.730
Steve, you don't have to.

24:41.813 --> 24:42.731
With chocolate syrup

24:42.814 --> 24:44.232
and the Stooges as rewards,

24:44.316 --> 24:46.943
I'm sure you'll find
we're very well behaved.

24:47.027 --> 24:48.612
All tapped out of Stooges.

24:48.695 --> 24:50.280
Chocolate syrup?

24:51.281 --> 24:53.491
Pray for mercy.

24:55.076 --> 24:57.204
So what do you think?

24:57.287 --> 24:58.580
{\an3}Let me get
this straight:

24:58.663 --> 25:00.248
{\an3}she gives the guy
a present,

25:00.332 --> 25:03.251
and he passes it on
to his girlfriend?

25:03.335 --> 25:04.419
Just like a disease.

25:04.502 --> 25:06.254
Oh, this guy!

25:06.338 --> 25:08.590
I never even thought about that.
He is such a pig.

25:08.673 --> 25:10.258
{\an4}BRANDON:
So why does your
friend want him?

25:10.342 --> 25:12.302
And why do you
want to read about him?

25:12.385 --> 25:15.430
{\an5}To remind me how
lucky I am to have
a guy like you.

25:15.513 --> 25:16.932
You certainly are.

25:17.015 --> 25:19.935
I'd think Monahan would be
a living reminder of that.

25:20.018 --> 25:24.439
Hey, can we stop the man bashing
for a couple minutes here, guys?

25:24.522 --> 25:25.732
Oh, come on, Brandon.

25:25.815 --> 25:27.525
{\an1}You can't
defend Monahan.

25:27.609 --> 25:29.152
I bet his wife
doesn't even know

25:29.236 --> 25:30.278
how he treats women
who work under him.

25:30.362 --> 25:33.114
Always the last to know.

25:33.198 --> 25:35.158
{\an1}Even though the reality is
probably staring her

25:35.242 --> 25:36.451
right in the face.

25:36.534 --> 25:38.078
You got to take him down, Kelly.

25:38.161 --> 25:39.704
{\an1}BRANDON:
She'll do the right thing.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.916
Well, if the future
of the clinic

25:42.999 --> 25:45.252
is at stake, then they're gonna
take his side; they'll have to.

25:45.335 --> 25:47.629
Amazing.

25:47.712 --> 25:50.465
It's not the sleazebags
you got to watch out for.

25:50.548 --> 25:52.801
It's the nice guys who, well,
for the most part,

25:52.884 --> 25:54.678
do and say the right things.

25:56.346 --> 25:57.264
What do you mean?

25:57.347 --> 25:59.307
Well, they think they've
got license to act out.

25:59.391 --> 26:01.559
It's hard to get anybody else
to see how wrong they are

26:01.643 --> 26:03.144
when they don't even
see it themselves.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.271
But it can be done.

26:04.354 --> 26:07.941
{\an3}Well, it's his word
against mine.

26:08.024 --> 26:09.609
{\an1}His words
are the problem.

26:09.693 --> 26:10.986
Hasn't anybody else
heard how he talks to you?

26:11.069 --> 26:12.487
No, I don't think so.

26:12.570 --> 26:14.197
Well, then you should let them.

26:14.281 --> 26:16.283
{\an1}BRANDON:
I'm going to go

26:16.366 --> 26:17.242
get the glasses
from the living room.

26:17.325 --> 26:20.161
No, you stay.
I'll go.

26:22.580 --> 26:24.708
Boy, is she missing the point.

26:24.791 --> 26:28.086
This girl just attracts
all the wrong kind of guys.

26:28.169 --> 26:30.130
{\an1}Harassing doctors,
cheating boyfriends...

26:30.213 --> 26:32.632
She's a regular
country and western song.

26:34.092 --> 26:36.428
I want you to get the hell
out of my house

26:36.511 --> 26:38.680
and I want you to stay away
from my girlfriend.

26:38.763 --> 26:39.973
There's nothing between us.

26:40.056 --> 26:41.016
There never was.

26:41.099 --> 26:42.058
There never will be.

26:42.142 --> 26:43.184
Do you understand?

26:48.815 --> 26:51.318
(indistinct chatter)

26:51.401 --> 26:52.819
{\an5}ANNOUNCER (on TV):
And there's the bell
for round two.

26:52.902 --> 26:55.322
Rocco and Kristoff are right
back in there, toe-to-toe.

26:55.405 --> 26:57.699
Already, this fight has shown
the explosive power

26:57.782 --> 26:58.658
of both of these guys.

26:58.742 --> 27:00.660
Anything can happen
and it all comes down

27:00.744 --> 27:02.203
to who's got what left...

27:02.287 --> 27:04.080
I've got to tell you,
it's our best night yet.

27:04.164 --> 27:05.165
Congrats.

27:05.248 --> 27:06.916
You know what, forget about
the pat on the back.

27:07.000 --> 27:08.376
I want a new deal.

27:08.460 --> 27:10.045
It's been two weeks, right?
I give you a piece,

27:10.128 --> 27:12.047
even though you don't put up
anything, and you want

27:12.130 --> 27:13.214
to renegotiate.

27:13.298 --> 27:14.257
{\an1}Is she always
like this?

27:14.341 --> 27:16.384
Keep me out of it.

27:16.468 --> 27:17.552
Look, we have
an extra bartender.

27:17.635 --> 27:19.596
I want you to restock the
register with small bills, okay?

27:19.679 --> 27:21.056
What about the raise?

27:21.139 --> 27:22.432
What about it?

27:24.434 --> 27:26.061
Back to the salt mine.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.313
{\an6}I'm going to
grab a drink.
Okay.

27:31.816 --> 27:33.401
(indistinct chatter)

27:35.862 --> 27:37.697
{\an3}I'm going to
give you guys...

27:37.781 --> 27:39.491
{\an6}which is a very
good thing...
Hey, guys.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.368
There's a few minutes
left in happy hour.

27:41.451 --> 27:43.453
See you at the bar.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.706
I don't think we've met.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.083
Duke Weatherill.

27:48.166 --> 27:49.417
You've got a great place here.

27:49.501 --> 27:51.252
You know what, save it, Duke.

27:51.336 --> 27:52.379
Nat told me the whole story,

27:52.462 --> 27:54.422
and I really don't want
you doing business here, okay?

27:54.506 --> 27:56.841
{\an3}Hey, Duke, can we still
get in on that hockey game?

27:56.925 --> 27:58.259
{\an1}Oh, yeah, sure,
uh, but, you know,

27:58.343 --> 28:00.220
{\an1}give me a moment
here though, okay?

28:02.347 --> 28:04.432
Now, young lady,

28:04.516 --> 28:05.809
{\an3}I'm going to make you
a proposition.

28:05.892 --> 28:08.228
You let me operate here,

28:08.311 --> 28:10.438
and I will cut you in
on tonight's action.

28:10.522 --> 28:12.607
And what kind of cut
would that be, huh?

28:12.690 --> 28:14.401
{\an3}I'll give you a quarter
of what I do.

28:14.484 --> 28:15.777
And I clear $2,000 a night.

28:15.860 --> 28:17.278
Which means $4,000 a night.

28:17.362 --> 28:20.073
I'll take a third in cash,
by 11:00 tomorrow.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.366
Is that a yes or no?

28:23.868 --> 28:26.287
{\an3}No wonder this place
is jumping, you're good.

28:26.371 --> 28:28.206
{\an3}Deal.

28:29.332 --> 28:31.251
ANNOUNCER (on TV):
He momentarily lost his balance,

28:31.334 --> 28:32.794
but he regains his composure.

28:32.877 --> 28:34.504
Now he's back
on the attack to Rocco.

28:34.587 --> 28:36.464
Just what is it?
Rocco is powering...

28:36.548 --> 28:40.218
David? Hey.

28:40.301 --> 28:43.430
{\an1}Listen, what you told me
yesterday,

28:43.513 --> 28:46.474
{\an1}I can't seem to get it
out of my head.

28:50.103 --> 28:51.146
I'm sorry.

28:51.229 --> 28:54.190
Um, I was just a little upset.

28:54.274 --> 28:55.650
No, don't be sorry.

28:55.733 --> 28:57.360
I'm glad that you told me.

28:57.444 --> 29:00.864
{\an1}I mean, I... I guess I was
feeling kind of sad

29:00.947 --> 29:03.491
{\an1}when I thought that you had
moved on so quickly.

29:03.575 --> 29:06.578
But now that I know you
haven't, I feel better.

29:09.497 --> 29:11.332
You and Noah have moved on.

29:11.416 --> 29:13.334
Yeah, we're seeing each other,
but that's it.

29:13.418 --> 29:16.212
I mean, we haven't...

29:19.090 --> 29:20.800
It's not like it was
with you and me.

29:20.884 --> 29:23.553
Wait a second, you mean
that you two haven't...?

29:23.636 --> 29:25.013
No.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.347
We haven't.

29:26.431 --> 29:30.018
That's... why I was
relieved to know

29:30.101 --> 29:32.937
that you and Valerie haven't.

29:35.190 --> 29:38.193
Donna, that's...

29:38.276 --> 29:40.528
that's not entirely accurate.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.363
You were lying?

29:42.447 --> 29:44.699
Or, or what,
you're lying now?

29:44.782 --> 29:46.534
'Cause I don't understand this.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.369
Is this some sort
of sick game to you, David?

29:48.453 --> 29:50.246
Look, I never meant to hurt you.

29:50.330 --> 29:52.916
Yeah, you just wanted
to throw it in my face

29:52.999 --> 29:54.751
a couple of times, right?

29:59.130 --> 30:01.049
Hey, will you take me home now?

30:01.132 --> 30:02.884
It's winding down,
but it's not over yet.

30:02.967 --> 30:06.513
{\an3}Oh, well, I thought
we could go home together.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.181
Whoa, look at the time.

30:12.435 --> 30:14.270
Early night?

30:14.354 --> 30:16.022
Yep.

30:16.105 --> 30:17.732
{\an1}I don't know what's
going on between them,

30:17.815 --> 30:19.817
{\an1}but they're definitely
sleeping together.

30:22.445 --> 30:24.447
And now you want
to sleep with me?

30:24.531 --> 30:26.366
Tell me it's a coincidence.

30:26.449 --> 30:28.409
I thought it's what you wanted.

30:28.493 --> 30:31.079
Yeah, it is,
but for the right reasons.

30:31.162 --> 30:33.206
I mean, not to get back
at your ex-boyfriend.

30:34.332 --> 30:37.377
{\an3}Look, Donna, maybe you should
go home alone tonight.

30:37.460 --> 30:40.129
Maybe I should.

30:40.213 --> 30:42.507
All right.

30:49.180 --> 30:50.515
ZACH:
<i>Look, I'm done.</i>

30:57.105 --> 30:59.107
(snoring)

31:28.261 --> 31:29.512
(phone ringing)

31:29.596 --> 31:31.639
{\an3}If that is another
hang up...

31:31.723 --> 31:33.725
(ringing continues)

31:35.393 --> 31:36.644
Hello?

31:36.728 --> 31:37.812
It's me.

31:37.895 --> 31:41.107
It's a source on a story
I'm working on.

31:41.190 --> 31:42.358
I'll be up in a minute.

31:43.735 --> 31:45.153
Did you just kiss her?

31:45.236 --> 31:47.030
I'm sorry.

31:47.113 --> 31:48.197
I didn't mean that.

31:48.281 --> 31:49.324
I don't want to know.

31:49.407 --> 31:50.992
What do you want?

31:51.075 --> 31:53.620
Tonight...

31:53.703 --> 31:56.623
I just had to see
the two of you together.

31:56.706 --> 31:58.291
I know you really love her.

31:58.374 --> 32:00.293
This has got to stop.

32:00.376 --> 32:02.337
You said you were sorry.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.380
I am, too.

32:04.464 --> 32:06.132
I just...

32:08.384 --> 32:09.552
Come on. Don't do this.

32:10.928 --> 32:12.847
You did feel something,
didn't you?

32:12.930 --> 32:15.350
Being in my bed,

32:15.433 --> 32:18.019
making love to me?

32:18.102 --> 32:19.604
It was good, wasn't it?

32:22.273 --> 32:24.525
Yes, it was, okay?

32:26.110 --> 32:28.196
Emma, you're beautiful
and you're smart.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.365
Don't waste your time on me.

32:30.448 --> 32:33.034
Well, I guess that's
all I wanted to hear.

32:33.117 --> 32:36.704
I'll clear my stuff
out of the office tomorrow.

32:36.788 --> 32:38.373
You don't have to be there.

32:38.456 --> 32:40.291
I think we're finally doing
the right thing.

32:41.793 --> 32:43.378
Good-bye, Emma.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.923
(phone beeps off)

32:51.678 --> 32:53.221
(beeps, tape rewinding)

32:53.304 --> 32:55.056
EMMA (on tape):
...making love to me?

32:55.139 --> 32:56.224
It was good, wasn't it?

32:56.307 --> 32:59.018
BRANDON (on tape):
Yes, it was, okay?

32:59.102 --> 33:01.854
Emma, you're beautiful
and you're smart...

33:09.320 --> 33:11.531
(sniffs)

33:11.614 --> 33:12.699
(groans)

33:12.782 --> 33:13.741
{\an1}(chuckles)

33:13.825 --> 33:16.327
I didn't even hear
you make coffee.

33:16.411 --> 33:18.287
Donna actually made it.

33:18.371 --> 33:20.456
She's already left
for her job interview.

33:20.540 --> 33:23.084
She must have been
really nervous.

33:24.127 --> 33:26.170
Donna left?

33:26.254 --> 33:27.255
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

33:27.338 --> 33:29.048
Did she talk to Zach?

33:29.132 --> 33:30.717
No, he's still sleeping.

33:30.800 --> 33:33.261
He climbed into bed
with me last night.

33:33.344 --> 33:35.388
He hasn't done that
for a really long time.

33:35.471 --> 33:38.224
{\an1}It's a lot of changes
for a little kid, you know?

33:38.307 --> 33:42.228
Mm, you should see the
changes that he made.

33:42.311 --> 33:44.772
To Donna's designs.

33:44.856 --> 33:46.733
{\an3}He didn't.
I nodded off last night.

33:46.816 --> 33:49.986
{\an3}When I was sleeping, he drew
all over Donna's sketches.

33:51.362 --> 33:53.114
{\an3}He's not very good at
staying in the lines either.

33:53.197 --> 33:54.741
Well, she didn't say
anything about it.

33:54.824 --> 33:58.327
{\an3}I stuffed her sketchbook
into her portfolio.

33:58.411 --> 34:00.371
I wanted to talk to her first.

34:00.455 --> 34:01.956
You mean she doesn't know
about it?

34:02.039 --> 34:04.751
Now, I realize that I'm very
close to the drop dead point

34:04.834 --> 34:06.836
for the summer fashions,
but I do have some ideas.

34:06.919 --> 34:09.630
Donna, I'll give you
what I give anybody

34:09.714 --> 34:12.175
{\an3}who comes to me
with an idea.

34:12.257 --> 34:15.178
{\an3}Two whole minutes,
starting now.

34:15.261 --> 34:16.846
That much, huh?

34:16.929 --> 34:18.139
Let's see your designs.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.308
Okay.
(phone rings)

34:20.391 --> 34:24.603
{\an1}Oh, gosh,
I'm very sorry.

34:24.687 --> 34:26.856
{\an1}All right.

34:37.366 --> 34:39.452
Uh, well, um,

34:39.534 --> 34:43.664
{\an1}you see, pencil
is just so lifeless.

34:43.748 --> 34:46.458
These are <i> your</i> designs?

34:47.877 --> 34:50.254
Yes.

34:51.380 --> 34:52.757
You draw like a
five year old.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.346
You're a genius.
I'm what?

34:58.429 --> 35:00.389
A genius.
(Donna gasps weakly)

35:00.473 --> 35:02.642
It looks almost
as if you used crayons.

35:02.725 --> 35:03.935
Yeah.

35:04.018 --> 35:05.019
It's going to be impossible
to replicate,

35:05.103 --> 35:06.521
but we have to do it.

35:06.604 --> 35:09.899
But the coloring screams
"Break free,

35:09.982 --> 35:11.901
forget rules, have fun!"

35:11.984 --> 35:13.903
Yeah, just, just like a, a day
at the beach, right?

35:13.986 --> 35:15.071
Exactly.

35:15.154 --> 35:18.491
So, Donna... what are you doing
for the next six months?

35:18.574 --> 35:20.660
Working here?
You got it.

35:20.743 --> 35:22.495
Yay.
Congratulations.

35:22.578 --> 35:24.205
Thank you.

35:24.288 --> 35:26.541
Now...

35:26.624 --> 35:29.710
all we need is a name.

35:29.794 --> 35:31.420
Child's Play?

35:34.423 --> 35:36.008
Yeah.

35:40.304 --> 35:43.224
You got all your stuff?

35:43.307 --> 35:44.350
Took you long enough.

35:44.433 --> 35:46.352
I was too upset
to pack yesterday.

35:50.356 --> 35:52.316
(box clattering)

35:54.652 --> 35:57.405
I'll help you carry it out
to the car.

35:58.948 --> 36:01.784
{\an1}You got
to toughen up, Kelly.

36:01.868 --> 36:03.411
{\an1}Don't cower
every time a man

36:03.494 --> 36:05.371
pays you a compliment.

36:05.454 --> 36:08.165
KELLY:
Flattery was not your intent.

36:08.249 --> 36:10.376
I don't really like
what we're doing here.

36:10.459 --> 36:11.586
Just give it a minute.

36:11.669 --> 36:13.296
{\an5}DR. MONAHAN:
Come on, get off
your high horse, will you?

36:13.379 --> 36:14.881
And learn something
from this experience.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.048
You're a beautiful girl.

36:16.132 --> 36:18.050
You got a great body.

36:18.134 --> 36:20.386
Use what you've got.

36:20.469 --> 36:22.096
What I've got is
a college degree.

36:22.179 --> 36:23.973
I have experience in my field.

36:24.056 --> 36:25.766
Well, you didn't handle me
very well.

36:25.850 --> 36:28.436
Which was the most important
part of your job.

36:28.519 --> 36:30.229
I guess you're right.

36:32.315 --> 36:34.609
Really?

36:36.319 --> 36:38.112
You filed charges against me.

36:38.195 --> 36:39.071
Well, I realized

36:39.155 --> 36:42.325
{\an1}I was going to be needing
a recommendation.

36:43.367 --> 36:45.494
Well...

36:48.372 --> 36:51.292
{\an3}...we could talk about
your performance.

36:51.375 --> 36:53.294
Which I'll bet
is pretty good.

36:53.377 --> 36:55.963
{\an3}Of course, at the moment, I
don't have enough information

36:56.047 --> 36:59.216
for a thorough review.

36:59.300 --> 37:00.968
Why don't you
take this off?

37:01.052 --> 37:03.095
I was talking about my job.

37:03.179 --> 37:04.347
{\an1}You're making me
very uncomfortable.

37:04.430 --> 37:05.306
Well, get comfortable.

37:05.389 --> 37:07.099
KELLY:
Stop it.

37:11.270 --> 37:12.521
What's up, Doc?

37:15.358 --> 37:16.817
This isn't the way it looks.

37:16.901 --> 37:18.653
Mm-hmm.

37:18.736 --> 37:21.739
Your contract with the Wyatt
Foundation is terminated.

37:21.822 --> 37:23.866
You're fired.

37:23.950 --> 37:26.494
You're closing down
a free clinic?

37:26.577 --> 37:28.955
There's an achievement.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.164
Wait till it hits the papers.

37:30.248 --> 37:31.999
{\an3}I've already talked to
an excellent doctor.

37:32.083 --> 37:33.334
{\an5}His name's
John Martin.
Would he actually

37:33.417 --> 37:35.211
consider this position?

37:35.294 --> 37:38.297
He's my best friend's father,
and he's already agreed.

37:49.600 --> 37:50.851
You okay?
Yeah.

37:50.935 --> 37:53.354
Brandon, thank you.

37:55.314 --> 37:58.567
DUKE:
<i>11:00 as promised and...</i>

37:59.610 --> 38:02.196
...your fee.

38:02.780 --> 38:04.699
No fooling?

38:04.782 --> 38:07.326
For one night, huh?

38:07.410 --> 38:09.203
What can I say? It's
a lucrative business.

38:09.286 --> 38:11.831
{\an3}That's the lure in
spite of the penalties.

38:11.914 --> 38:13.708
I get the idea.

38:13.791 --> 38:16.752
{\an3}It occurs to me that a
charming, beautiful woman

38:16.836 --> 38:18.212
like yourself...

38:18.295 --> 38:21.841
{\an3}well, guys might be more
likely to lay a bet with you

38:21.924 --> 38:22.842
than with me.

38:22.925 --> 38:23.801
Tell me more.

38:23.884 --> 38:25.886
{\an3}I need a front, someone
to bring me the bets

38:25.970 --> 38:27.888
{\an3}while I work the phones
and lay them off.

38:27.972 --> 38:29.557
No risk, no reward.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.350
{\an1}And why would I want
to do that?

38:31.434 --> 38:34.353
Your take would be double
what you made last night.

38:37.440 --> 38:38.983
Okay, I'm in.

38:39.066 --> 38:40.776
Great.

38:40.860 --> 38:41.944
I'll be in touch

38:42.028 --> 38:43.779
{\an3}this afternoon about
odds and events.

38:43.863 --> 38:45.614
Okay.

38:55.875 --> 38:57.376
{\an4}Hey.
JANET:
Hi, boss.

38:57.460 --> 38:58.753
I see we haven't
scared you off yet.

38:58.836 --> 39:00.379
{\an1}No, not hardly,
and I'm going to be

39:00.463 --> 39:02.089
back bright and early
tomorrow morning, too.

39:02.173 --> 39:03.215
{\an3}Great.

39:03.299 --> 39:05.301
{\an1}Um, I guess we can't
say so much for...

39:08.971 --> 39:11.807
Anyway, good night.

39:11.891 --> 39:13.934
Yeah, good night.

39:23.486 --> 39:25.654
I'll be out of here in a minute.

39:25.738 --> 39:27.948
Steve said you were
off somewhere with Kelly.

39:28.032 --> 39:29.450
Romantic interlude?

39:29.533 --> 39:31.285
I was at the clinic.

39:31.368 --> 39:34.830
{\an1}Ah, big doings
with Miss Nightingale?

39:36.707 --> 39:38.000
Monahan's out.

39:38.084 --> 39:39.293
No kidding.

39:39.376 --> 39:41.420
How'd Kelly pull that off?

39:41.504 --> 39:43.506
She took your advice.

39:43.589 --> 39:45.299
She got the people
who run the clinic

39:45.382 --> 39:46.467
to see him for who he really is.

39:46.550 --> 39:48.469
Give a guy like that
a little rope,

39:48.552 --> 39:50.262
he'll hang himself every time.

40:29.718 --> 40:32.221
{\an5}EMMA (on tape):
You did feel something,
didn't you?

40:32.304 --> 40:34.223
Being in my bed,

40:34.306 --> 40:36.308
making love to me?

40:36.392 --> 40:38.644
It was good, wasn't it?

40:40.896 --> 40:43.315
BRANDON (on tape):
Yes, it was, okay?

40:44.650 --> 40:47.153
Emma, you're beautiful
and you're smart.

40:47.236 --> 40:49.196
Don't waste your time on me.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.282
{\an5}EMMA:
Well, I guess that's
all I wanted to hear.

40:57.079 --> 40:58.205
That was terrific.

40:58.289 --> 41:00.207
{\an4}It's a congratulatory
dinner, it's supposed
to be terrific.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.418
{\an3}I almost died
when I found out

41:02.501 --> 41:04.295
{\an3}that Zach had colored in
all my sketches.

41:04.378 --> 41:06.505
Did you tell Carly?

41:06.589 --> 41:09.049
{\an3}Yes, and she promised
not to punish him.

41:09.133 --> 41:11.677
That's good of her.

41:11.760 --> 41:14.221
This is so amazing.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.557
You know, you didn't have
to be so extravagant, though.

41:16.640 --> 41:17.892
This is a lot?

41:17.975 --> 41:19.268
Hmm...

41:19.351 --> 41:21.145
I don't think it's enough.

41:22.396 --> 41:23.856
I love you.

41:23.939 --> 41:26.275
I love you, too.
