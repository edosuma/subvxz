20:29.712 --> 20:31.646
- Scary Gary, yes.

20:31.748 --> 20:33.581
- Damn!
- Mm-hmm.

20:33.683 --> 20:35.049
- Atlanta's mad small.

20:35.151 --> 20:36.250
- Too small.

20:36.352 --> 20:38.619
I say that all the time.

20:38.721 --> 20:40.554
- Is he legit?

20:40.657 --> 20:41.889
- He is.

20:41.991 --> 20:43.257
- You sure?

20:43.359 --> 20:45.259
- Look, I've vetted
his ass left and right.

20:45.361 --> 20:48.129
But Zac, don't go giving
him all your money.

20:48.231 --> 20:49.797
- I'm not giving Scary
Gary none of my money.

20:49.899 --> 20:50.865
You know how I do.

20:50.967 --> 20:52.366
- Good.
- Come on.

20:52.468 --> 20:54.201
- Seriously.
- I'm serious.

20:54.304 --> 20:56.037
What else is up?
- [phone ringing]

20:56.139 --> 20:57.571
- Especially with that.

20:57.674 --> 20:59.106
- You hang on.
I gotta take this.

20:59.208 --> 21:01.475
This is Andi, mm-hmm.
- Fine.

21:01.577 --> 21:02.476
- Hey.

21:02.578 --> 21:06.881
- Hey, um, don't
shoot the messenger.

21:06.983 --> 21:08.382
- What are you talking about?

21:08.484 --> 21:10.918
- Uh, Karen wants to meet
up with the girls tonight

21:11.020 --> 21:14.622
and she asked me to invite you.

21:14.724 --> 21:15.556
- What?

21:15.658 --> 21:20.194
- Yeah, she wanted
me to invite you.

21:20.296 --> 21:23.197
- [sighs] Yeah, no,
I'ma pass on that.

21:23.299 --> 21:26.133
- Okay, I'll let her know.

21:26.235 --> 21:30.137
- And what does Karen
want me to come for?

21:30.239 --> 21:32.840
- She says it involves you too.

21:32.942 --> 21:35.543
- Involves me too?

21:35.645 --> 21:37.979
Ah, I see.

21:38.081 --> 21:39.747
- Yeah, I don't know
what it's about.

21:39.849 --> 21:42.883
- Ah, I think I do.

21:42.986 --> 21:45.353
- Wait, what is it?

21:45.455 --> 21:47.154
- Look, let me talk to Zac.

21:47.256 --> 21:49.724
- No, Fatima, what is going on?

21:49.826 --> 21:53.160
- I'll let Karen tell you, but
I need to talk to Zac first.

21:53.262 --> 21:56.530
And I'll let you
know if I'm coming.

21:56.632 --> 21:58.566
- Are you sure?

21:58.668 --> 22:01.869
- Yes.

22:01.971 --> 22:04.438
- Okay, text me.

22:04.540 --> 22:07.041
- All right, I'll text you.

22:07.143 --> 22:08.642
- Okay.

22:11.180 --> 22:12.580
- Will you stop?
- I didn't do nothin'.

22:12.682 --> 22:14.215
I was not with Karen.
I don't know what that's about.

22:14.317 --> 22:15.416
- Zac, chill, chill, chill.

22:15.518 --> 22:16.884
- They be on bullshit,
the whole sister circle--

22:16.986 --> 22:18.319
- Hey!

22:18.421 --> 22:20.287
- All right, go ahead.

22:20.390 --> 22:22.089
- It's not that.

22:22.191 --> 22:25.393
Um, Karen wants to meet with me.

22:25.495 --> 22:27.061
- Nope, we are not doing that.

22:27.163 --> 22:28.696
You see where we are?
Brand new.

22:28.798 --> 22:30.631
I'm not doing that no more.
- I know, I know...

22:30.733 --> 22:33.334
- I'm not with the
bullshit, Fatima.

22:33.436 --> 22:34.835
- I knew you were gonna
say that.

22:36.506 --> 22:37.872
- [sighs]

22:37.974 --> 22:39.040
- So what's up?

22:39.142 --> 22:40.441
What she wanna
meet with you for?

22:40.543 --> 22:42.410
- I don't know, but I think
she may wanna tell the girls

22:42.512 --> 22:44.578
that she's pregnant?
I don't know.

22:44.680 --> 22:46.981
- She already told
them that shit, like--

22:47.083 --> 22:49.316
- I don't think she has.

22:49.419 --> 22:51.152
- Why you think that?

22:51.254 --> 22:52.620
- Andi would have mentioned it.

22:52.722 --> 22:54.922
- Oh, y'all--y'all
talk like that?

22:55.024 --> 22:56.357
- Not about Karen,

22:56.459 --> 23:02.029
but I asked her and she
didn't say anything, so...

23:02.131 --> 23:05.066
- So why does she
want you there?

23:05.168 --> 23:07.401
- I don't know, Zac.
But if this is--

23:07.503 --> 23:08.903
- There is no if.
- --your baby.

23:09.005 --> 23:10.304
- It is.

23:10.406 --> 23:15.643
- If it's your baby, then...

23:15.745 --> 23:18.546
maybe she's trying to set a
foundation for co-parenting

23:18.648 --> 23:22.183
and wants her friends to know.

23:22.285 --> 23:24.285
- You think?
- I don't know. Tell me.

23:24.387 --> 23:27.621
Is she rational?
- No.

23:27.723 --> 23:31.992
Okay, let me--let
me not be emotional.

23:32.095 --> 23:35.496
She can be.

23:35.598 --> 23:38.599
- Okay, so you tell
me what you think.

23:38.701 --> 23:41.469
If you tell me not
to go, then I won't go.

23:41.571 --> 23:44.138
- You askin' my permission?

23:44.240 --> 23:46.273
- Yes.

23:46.375 --> 23:50.244
- In that case,

23:50.346 --> 23:51.979
do you wanna go?

23:53.216 --> 23:55.549
- I mean, I can.

23:55.651 --> 23:59.053
- I didn't ask that.
I said, do you want to go?

23:59.155 --> 24:03.357
- Look, if some shit's goin'
down, I wanna know about it.

24:03.459 --> 24:05.559
- All right, I mean, if you
feel that strong about it,

24:05.661 --> 24:08.162
then I think you should go.

24:08.264 --> 24:09.897
- Okay, yeah.

24:09.999 --> 24:11.665
- Cool.

24:11.767 --> 24:13.234
You know, it's funny
you mentioned that,

24:13.336 --> 24:14.635
because she did just
come by the house earlier--

24:14.737 --> 24:16.036
- What house?

24:16.139 --> 24:17.671
- This house. She--

24:23.279 --> 24:25.813
[whispers] Fatima.

24:25.915 --> 24:27.348
- [snaps]

24:29.018 --> 24:31.752
- Slow down.

24:31.854 --> 24:33.821
- I'm fine.

24:33.923 --> 24:36.657
Go on.

24:36.759 --> 24:38.792
- But what was that, though?

24:38.895 --> 24:40.394
- What was what?

24:40.496 --> 24:42.329
- You just went blank.
You didn't move.

24:42.431 --> 24:44.298
You wasn't breathing.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.634
It looked like your
soul left your body.

24:46.736 --> 24:50.938
- No, no, no.
I was just taking it in.

24:51.040 --> 24:53.007
Now, tell me why she was here.

24:53.109 --> 24:55.109
- This is wild scary, son.

24:55.211 --> 24:56.844
You sure you wanna know?

24:56.946 --> 24:58.712
- Yes.

25:02.518 --> 25:05.386
- She just came by to tell me

25:05.488 --> 25:08.189
that somebody was at
the salon looking for me.

25:08.291 --> 25:09.290
That was it.

25:09.392 --> 25:11.759
- And who would that be, Zac?

25:11.861 --> 25:14.094
- I don't even know,
'cause I wasn't there.

25:14.197 --> 25:16.564
You see what I'm saying?
That's why she had to tell me.

25:16.666 --> 25:19.833
Can I come back in?

25:19.936 --> 25:21.936
- Right there.

25:22.038 --> 25:23.437
Continue.

25:23.539 --> 25:28.142
- She just said the
person looked official.

25:28.244 --> 25:29.944
- Okay, yeah.

25:30.046 --> 25:33.180
Then I definitely
need to go over there. Yup.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.682
- Can I hug you?
- Mm-mm.

25:34.784 --> 25:37.484
- All right,
um, you all right?

25:37.587 --> 25:40.654
- Yeah, I need to
get that information.

25:40.756 --> 25:42.923
- You know I can handle
that though, right?

25:43.025 --> 25:44.825
- I, I know you can.

25:44.927 --> 25:47.761
But I like when you
let me handle it.

25:47.863 --> 25:49.396
- And I'ma--I'ma
let you handle it.

25:49.498 --> 25:51.465
- Yeah.
- All right, you got it.

25:51.567 --> 25:53.867
- Okay. Well, I'ma
go home and change

25:53.970 --> 25:55.736
and head over to Andi's.

25:55.838 --> 25:57.271
- Why--why you need
to go home and change?

25:57.373 --> 25:58.305
You look good.

25:58.407 --> 25:59.506
You look great, as a matter--

25:59.609 --> 26:01.775
This is the best I
ever seen you look.

26:01.877 --> 26:04.945
- I know, but I need to
go put some jeans on,

26:05.047 --> 26:07.381
just in case some girls
try to jump me, yeah.

26:07.483 --> 26:08.682
- Fatima, ain't
nobody gonna jump you.

26:08.784 --> 26:10.918
Why you act like you in the pen?

26:11.020 --> 26:14.021
Ain't nobody gonna do nothin'
to you, baby, you're good. Like,

26:14.123 --> 26:16.423
this is... baby you're with me.
- I know. I know I'm good.

26:16.525 --> 26:20.060
And I feel bad for what
they did, so, it's all good.

26:20.162 --> 26:22.129
- You back?
- I'm back, baby.

26:22.231 --> 26:23.497
- I see the light
back in your eyes.

26:23.599 --> 26:28.202
Can I have a hug?
- Yeah, I'm back.

26:28.304 --> 26:29.370
We good.
- All right.

26:29.472 --> 26:30.804
- You good?
- I'm good.

26:30.906 --> 26:33.674
I'ma go play some basketball
while you go handle that.

26:33.776 --> 26:35.209
- Okay.
- Do your thing, all right?

26:35.311 --> 26:36.377
- All right.
- All right.

26:36.479 --> 26:37.444
- Okay, I'll see you later.

26:37.546 --> 26:39.747
- Your gun in that purse?
- Always.

26:43.019 --> 26:44.251
- I love you!

26:44.353 --> 26:45.753
- FATIMA: Love you too.

26:50.126 --> 26:51.091
- That girl gone!

26:53.270 --> 26:55.104
- ♪
- [crickets chirping]

26:55.206 --> 26:57.539
- Okay, you better.

27:00.177 --> 27:02.344
- Was that Gary?
- Yes.

27:02.446 --> 27:04.346
- What he say?

27:04.448 --> 27:08.917
- He said that the
movers will come tonight.

27:09.020 --> 27:10.586
- Okay, good.

27:12.923 --> 27:14.223
- That man...

27:17.294 --> 27:20.329
- How are you feeling?

27:20.431 --> 27:22.931
- I'm fine.

27:23.034 --> 27:28.804
- You thinking about
taking him back?

27:28.906 --> 27:32.174
- No.

27:32.276 --> 27:34.176
- Okay.

27:36.080 --> 27:37.513
- You don't have to
keep checking with me.

27:37.615 --> 27:40.849
I'm not gonna do that.

27:40.951 --> 27:43.085
- Okay.

27:43.187 --> 27:44.520
- [door opens]

27:47.124 --> 27:49.024
- Y'all got anything
to drink in here?

27:49.126 --> 27:51.160
- Sure, let me show you.

27:51.262 --> 27:52.728
All my beverages.

27:52.830 --> 27:54.963
- They took everything,
Danni, you know that.

27:55.066 --> 27:58.133
- Mm, we found some
stuff upstairs.

27:58.235 --> 27:59.435
- Oh.

27:59.537 --> 28:00.469
- Bitch, you wanna
see that apartment.

28:00.571 --> 28:01.737
- Mm-hmm.

28:01.839 --> 28:04.373
- How did you guys
get in it?

28:04.475 --> 28:06.475
- We just pressed
"P" for penthouse.

28:06.577 --> 28:07.643
- That worked?

28:07.745 --> 28:09.678
- Mm-hmm.
- Mm-hmm.

28:09.780 --> 28:12.181
- So it opened up
to the apartment?

28:12.283 --> 28:13.982
- Yes.
- Mm-hmm.

28:14.085 --> 28:15.951
- You know, that could
be a security issue.

28:16.053 --> 28:19.354
- Well, maybe they
were expecting you.

28:19.457 --> 28:22.057
- Maybe.

28:26.831 --> 28:30.065
- Want some?
- No, thanks.

28:30.167 --> 28:31.800
- You know this is
the good shit, right?

28:31.902 --> 28:34.970
- Uh, I'll pass,
yeah, I'll pass.

28:35.072 --> 28:38.974
- Mm, preacher, preacher.
- Uh-huh.

28:39.076 --> 28:41.343
- Can y'all stop saying that?
That's not what it is, okay?

28:41.445 --> 28:44.279
- First it's gonna be no more
tight jeans or short dresses.

28:44.381 --> 28:47.683
- Mm, no makeup.
- No more cussing.

28:47.785 --> 28:49.618
- No sex.
- Okay, all right, ladies.

28:49.720 --> 28:51.353
I think she gets it.

28:51.455 --> 28:55.858
Remember, she invited us here
so that she could talk to us.

28:55.960 --> 28:58.393
- Yeah, so could y'all not get
drunk before we talk.

28:58.496 --> 28:59.595
- That's actually a good idea.

28:59.697 --> 29:01.029
- Uh!
- Okay.

29:01.132 --> 29:03.465
- I'll tell you this,
I can handle that shit, come on.

29:03.567 --> 29:04.933
- Um, I'll just have half.

29:05.035 --> 29:07.269
Plus all the rest of
the glasses are upstairs.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.872
- Really, Brina?
- I'm just talking.

29:09.974 --> 29:12.040
- Okay, well, go ahead and go
on, we know you wanna tell us.

29:12.143 --> 29:14.076
Go ahead and tell
us what it was like.

29:14.178 --> 29:17.212
- All I'm saying, you
wanna see that apartment.

29:21.485 --> 29:23.051
- She don't.
She not doing that, okay?

29:23.154 --> 29:24.620
- Mm-mm.
- No.

29:24.722 --> 29:26.388
- You guys are not curious?
- No.

29:26.490 --> 29:28.924
- No, we're not.

29:29.026 --> 29:32.161
- Well, we were curious
about the Rolls.

29:32.263 --> 29:33.629
- Andi--
- I mean--

29:33.731 --> 29:34.763
- Oh yeah, what about the Rolls?

29:34.865 --> 29:36.899
- Nothing, nothing
about the Rolls.

29:37.001 --> 29:41.370
- We did a joyride in the Rolls.

29:41.472 --> 29:45.641
- Yeah, and that controlling-ass
man tracked us, followed us,

29:45.743 --> 29:47.109
whatever, something.

29:47.211 --> 29:48.844
- Karen, if you're gonna tell
the story, tell it right.

29:48.946 --> 29:51.680
- I am telling it right, Andi.

29:51.782 --> 29:53.982
- Okay, we were being followed,

29:54.084 --> 29:58.520
but it was by these
people dressed as cops.

29:58.622 --> 30:00.088
- That sounds kind of illegal.

30:00.191 --> 30:01.323
- Can I finish?

30:01.425 --> 30:04.092
- Yeah, but this
ain't helping us.

30:04.195 --> 30:09.565
- Okay, so they have this
cop car, they pull us over.

30:09.667 --> 30:13.001
They scare the living
crap out of us.

30:13.103 --> 30:14.369
And then they start
singing this song.

battle, guys, and that's okay.

39:01.014 --> 39:03.181
- I'm sorry, um...

39:03.283 --> 39:04.649
- It happened.

39:04.751 --> 39:06.918
- Do you remember
everything he said to you?

39:07.020 --> 39:08.386
- Karen...
- KAREN: What?

39:08.488 --> 39:10.922
We need to balance out
all this beautiful.

39:11.024 --> 39:12.490
- She gets it.

39:12.592 --> 39:14.826
- Okay, well, as long
as she ain't forget.

39:15.729 --> 39:17.328
- All right, Karen,
you wanted to talk.

39:17.431 --> 39:19.497
Let's talk, we're here,
let's do that, come on.

39:19.599 --> 39:21.466
- I don't wanna talk here.

39:21.568 --> 39:23.868
- Girl, I'm going to
get some more glasses.

39:23.970 --> 39:25.603
- Why we gotta do it here, huh?

39:25.705 --> 39:27.005
What if this -- put
cameras in here?

39:27.107 --> 39:28.406
You know how he is.

39:28.508 --> 39:29.841
- You know what, bitch?

39:29.943 --> 39:31.342
Them blinds weren't open
when me and Sabrina was here,

39:31.445 --> 39:32.610
so he might be.

39:32.712 --> 39:34.979
And he can watch us
enjoy all this shit.

39:35.081 --> 39:36.347
- All this shit!

39:36.450 --> 39:37.982
- I don't wanna do
this here, okay?

39:38.084 --> 39:39.050
I don't.

39:39.152 --> 39:40.185
- Come on!

39:40.287 --> 39:43.488
Just let her enjoy
it for a second.

39:47.761 --> 39:50.094
- Okay, fine.

39:50.197 --> 39:51.196
- Come on, sit down.

39:51.298 --> 39:52.464
- You want something to drink?

39:52.566 --> 39:53.698
'Cause you're
celebrating, bitch.

39:53.800 --> 39:55.600
- I am celebrating.
Pour it up immediately.

39:55.702 --> 39:59.304
- Let me get the wine
opener, find this shit.

39:59.406 --> 40:01.272
- I got the glasses.
- Look at this view.

Oh, thank you, yes.

40:02.776 --> 40:05.510
I'm gonna need a GPS to
find it, find my way back.

40:05.612 --> 40:07.178
- The perfect lighting.

40:07.280 --> 40:10.381
- It's the perfect everything.

40:10.484 --> 40:12.484
Oh my gosh, pour--pour
Karen some too.

40:12.586 --> 40:14.052
- Yeah, Karen.
- You definitely need some.

40:14.154 --> 40:15.353
- Mm-hmm.

40:15.455 --> 40:16.621
- I can't drink.

40:16.723 --> 40:19.757
- Why not?

40:19.860 --> 40:21.025
- Because I'm pregnant.

40:26.032 --> 40:27.899
- KAREN: Next, on "Sistas"...

40:28.001 --> 40:30.468
- I said I'm pregnant, Danni!

40:30.570 --> 40:32.537
- Are you gonna keep it?

40:32.639 --> 40:35.473
That's a legitimate question.

40:35.575 --> 40:36.574
- Who's there?

40:36.676 --> 40:38.776
Show yourself,
mother--, come out!

40:38.879 --> 40:40.612

- Bitch, I know who "me" is.

That's why I'm ready to get me!
