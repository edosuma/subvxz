05:43.093 --> 05:45.846
We all knew,
especially in the last few years,

05:45.846 --> 05:47.723
just how fragile this business was.

05:47.723 --> 05:51.643
The years from 2010 to 2020,

05:51.643 --> 05:54.396
we just had an excess of
everything in our industry.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.982
<i>Media, restaurants, chefs, everything.</i>

05:56.982 --> 05:59.651
<i>Hyped up to the Nth degree.</i>

05:59.651 --> 06:01.403

06:01.403 --> 06:03.614

healthy in the long run.

06:05.574 --> 06:08.660
<i>The restaurant industry was a bubble.</i>

06:08.660 --> 06:11.663
<i>There was this insatiable
appetite for newness.</i>

06:13.040 --> 06:16.710
<i>And I think a big catalyst
was the media hyping it up.</i>

06:16.710 --> 06:19.213
The glamor made it something like...

06:20.839 --> 06:21.840
we need more of it.

06:22.591 --> 06:26.595
<i>Chefs were presented opportunities that
they had never been presented before.</i>

06:26.595 --> 06:29.097
More and more restaurants opened up,
I certainly was part of that

06:29.723 --> 06:31.934
<i>because it felt like you couldn't stop.</i>

06:31.934 --> 06:34.061
This is grow or die.

06:34.561 --> 06:37.731
<i>I don't think anybody anticipated
what was going to burst that bubble</i>

06:37.731 --> 06:40.025
<i>was a global pandemic,</i>

06:40.025 --> 06:41.568
<i>but something had to give.</i>

06:49.660 --> 06:52.996
‐ Well,

06:53.580 --> 06:55.082
<i>I mean, there's so many factors.</i>

06:55.874 --> 06:58.752
<i>Rent, the amount of employees you need,</i>

06:59.086 --> 07:01.755
food costs, wine costs,
the permits you have to pull.

07:03.090 --> 07:05.634
<i>You try to keep your food margins at 20%.</i>

07:05.634 --> 07:07.177
<i>It ends up to be more like 35%.</i>

07:08.053 --> 07:11.306
<i>Your labor percentage is another 35%,</i>

07:11.306 --> 07:14.142
<i>and then you have rent
and you have utilities and all that stuff.</i>

07:14.142 --> 07:17.479
So, at the end of the day,
I'm probably paying

07:17.479 --> 07:20.732
50 cents per diner for them
to eat those chicken wings.

07:21.775 --> 07:23.402
<i>When the pandemic hit,</i>

07:23.402 --> 07:27.072
<i>within two weeks,
we had so many people going,</i>

07:27.072 --> 07:29.366
"I have to close my doors for good."

07:29.366 --> 07:30.826
Like, after two weeks.

07:30.826 --> 07:33.579
It's like,
how are we not prepared

07:33.579 --> 07:35.372
for a two week close down?

07:37.249 --> 07:39.877
<i>Restaurants are one
of the most decentralized</i>

07:39.877 --> 07:42.337
<i>sectors in business.</i>

07:42.337 --> 07:44.673
<i>Like, there's not the pope of
restaurants who says,</i>

07:44.673 --> 07:47.134
<i>"Well, here's how we're
gonna deal with egg prices</i>

07:47.134 --> 07:50.429
"or the rise of the internet
or the potential for a pandemic

07:50.429 --> 07:52.890
to ravage our entire sector."

07:52.890 --> 07:56.393
We talk about the restaurant
industry like it's a cohesive thing,

07:56.393 --> 07:58.437
and it's really not.

07:58.437 --> 08:00.564
And that's part of why

08:00.564 --> 08:02.649
it's so easy for it to get fucked.

08:06.195 --> 08:08.572
<i>If anything, the past year proved that</i>

08:08.572 --> 08:11.825
<i>Darwinian theory is a real thing.</i>

08:11.825 --> 08:13.702
And it was not just
survival of the fittest.

08:13.702 --> 08:15.913
It was survival of the most privileged.

08:15.913 --> 08:18.248
Survival of who had the most access.

08:18.248 --> 08:20.709
Survival of all of these things

08:20.709 --> 08:23.712
that not everyone can have,
and it wasn't necessarily fair.

08:25.047 --> 08:28.008
<i>I mean, there's countless restaurants that
closed that should not have closed.</i>

08:44.066 --> 08:45.859
‐ I mean, we're...

08:45.859 --> 08:47.861
We shut some down, and...

08:50.864 --> 08:51.949
Ah man.

08:51.949 --> 08:55.494
There was certainly a period
where I was like, "Oh this is‐‐
this is all over."

08:57.579 --> 09:01.542
To be faced with that,
it's like your professional mortality.

09:03.502 --> 09:05.879
I just felt so...

09:05.879 --> 09:07.673
stupid for a long time.

09:09.258 --> 09:12.636
<i>You pour yourself into this restaurant.</i>

09:12.636 --> 09:15.931
<i>You make it a sustainable business
where you're giving healthcare,</i>

09:15.931 --> 09:18.392
<i>you're making people happy,
all these things.</i>

09:18.392 --> 09:20.978
<i>And the stress,
it's just so much stress.</i>

09:22.271 --> 09:23.397
<i>You are taught...</i>

09:24.690 --> 09:28.944
that perfection and pursuit of excellence
is brainwash,

09:28.944 --> 09:30.654
and I bought that
hook, line, and sinker.

09:32.155 --> 09:35.158
<i>And then, all of a sudden,
it's taken away.</i>

09:36.410 --> 09:37.661
And I think that...

09:38.412 --> 09:41.164
vulnerability, that powerlessness,

09:41.665 --> 09:43.959
I think shook a lot of us to our core.

09:51.091 --> 09:52.384
<i>I'm talking to people that</i>

09:52.384 --> 09:56.597
are asking themselves
existential life questions.

09:57.514 --> 10:00.893
<i>This job is really hard.
It's physical work,</i>

10:00.893 --> 10:02.477
<i>there's a lot of hours.</i>

10:02.477 --> 10:05.981
<i>There's a lot of people in
the restaurant industry</i>

10:05.981 --> 10:08.192
<i>that are asking themselves</i>

10:08.192 --> 10:10.611
<i>is there something else
they could be doing,</i>

10:10.611 --> 10:13.280
and I'm asking this question, too.
It's like, "Is this what
I wanna be doing?"

10:13.947 --> 10:16.408
<i>It's a reassessment of what's happening.</i>

10:19.161 --> 10:21.288
I come here at least once a week.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.414
Oh man.

10:22.873 --> 10:25.876
‐ This would be five or six rows,

10:26.710 --> 10:29.213
like lines, queues,
and people just lined up, ordering.

10:30.923 --> 10:33.091
‐ What is the order. What should I order?

10:33.091 --> 10:35.511
So, our famous sandwich
is the beef French dip.

10:35.511 --> 10:37.304
<i>And it's a double dip.</i>

10:37.304 --> 10:38.931
<i>The best way to have it.</i>

10:38.931 --> 10:41.433
This has been around for generations.
Mm‐hmm.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.227
This is as old school
as you can get.

10:43.227 --> 10:45.062
This place is amazing.

10:46.271 --> 10:48.565
People seem to feel like,

10:48.565 --> 10:51.818
at least in our industry,
that things are gonna go back to normal.

10:51.818 --> 10:55.739
It's like, "oh, let's bring it back
to March of 2020."

10:56.198 --> 10:58.450
None of it was working
that well to begin with.

10:58.450 --> 11:00.035
‐ No.
This is just being honest, right?

11:00.035 --> 11:03.413
‐ We have undervalued food for so long.

11:03.413 --> 11:07.042
We have undervalued people
that wash our dishes for so long.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.419
The culture of our coworkers.

11:09.419 --> 11:11.713
I feel like that is gonna really shift.

11:11.713 --> 11:14.258
Mm‐hmm.
‐ I mean right now, I know all of us

11:14.258 --> 11:17.845
are probably struggling
to rehire people.
Mm‐hmm.

11:17.845 --> 11:21.473
‐ For me, I've kind of been
focused on a lot of different things

11:21.473 --> 11:23.767
other than the restaurant itself.

11:23.767 --> 11:26.061
‐ I think alternative revenue avenues

11:26.061 --> 11:28.021
are super important
for any business owner.

11:28.021 --> 11:30.357
We're expanding into our products

11:30.357 --> 11:32.693
and online retail, direct to consumer.

11:32.693 --> 11:34.319
We're doing a lot more other things...

11:34.319 --> 11:37.197
‐ And before, we didn't prioritize it
'cause there was no time.
No!

11:37.197 --> 11:39.533
I wanna hold this industry accountable

11:39.533 --> 11:42.870
because we should've been doing
this over the past 10, 20 years.

11:42.870 --> 11:44.997
We're talking about
an industry that still hasn't

11:44.997 --> 11:46.790
adopted the metric system for fuck's sake.

11:46.790 --> 11:49.209
Know what I mean?

11:49.209 --> 11:51.211
There's these legacies of...

11:52.880 --> 11:54.423
being so stubborn to change.

11:56.425 --> 11:59.011
<i>I think the greatest
obstacle in front of us</i>

11:59.011 --> 12:01.930
<i>is that nobody wants to change.</i>

12:01.930 --> 12:03.432
It's a very similar‐‐

12:03.432 --> 12:06.268
It's gonna sound totally
fucking crazy,

12:06.268 --> 12:09.563
but Malcolm Gladwell has this
great piece about Rick Barry.

12:12.149 --> 12:13.984
<i>He was the greatest free throw
shooter of all time</i>

12:13.984 --> 12:15.736
because he shot underhand.

12:15.736 --> 12:17.571
<i>Here he is at the line again.</i>

12:17.571 --> 12:19.364
<i>And he's still hitting nothing but net.</i>

12:19.364 --> 12:21.742
‐ Nobody wanted to do that
because it's not cool!

12:21.742 --> 12:22.910
<i>You lose street cred.</i>

12:23.911 --> 12:26.830
I think street cred and looking cool

12:26.830 --> 12:29.666
is why the restaurant industry

12:29.666 --> 12:31.460
missed the boat altogether.

12:32.377 --> 12:35.130
<i>The question then is what in priority</i>

12:35.130 --> 12:37.257
<i>are the things that we sorta
have to address?</i>

12:44.932 --> 12:46.141
<i>The restaurant business</i>

12:46.141 --> 12:49.019
employees a shit‐ton of people,

12:49.019 --> 12:50.812
so, uh...

12:50.812 --> 12:53.023
That's the scientific term for it.
‐ Yeah.

12:53.023 --> 12:56.485
<i>Most of the people who were
working with us,</i>

12:56.485 --> 13:00.572
they don't wanna deal
with the amount of stress,

13:00.572 --> 13:03.951
or the amount of pressure,
that comes with being in this business.

13:03.951 --> 13:07.371
‐ In a business like hospitality,

13:07.371 --> 13:09.373
it's a tough, tough, tough game.

13:09.873 --> 13:13.794
So, you feel like you've
gotta give more to get more,

13:13.794 --> 13:16.547
and I really don't know if
that's the case going forward.

13:17.464 --> 13:20.175
<i>I left the traditional models
because of how traditional they were,</i>

13:20.175 --> 13:23.846
<i>and that was, you know, kitchen was
the lowest of the totem pole for pay,</i>

13:23.846 --> 13:26.056
but the highest in my mind,

13:26.056 --> 13:29.059
and probably any back o' house
person's mind, in workload.

13:29.059 --> 13:31.562
‐ You work your ass off from the bussers

13:31.562 --> 13:34.189
to the line cooks to the head chef

13:34.189 --> 13:35.732
to the owners.

13:35.732 --> 13:38.735
<i>Restaurant culture is not
for the faint of heart.</i>

13:39.862 --> 13:42.406
<i>As a chef, you're a leader,
you're a therapist, you're a plumber,</i>

13:42.406 --> 13:44.700
you know, you're the handyman,

13:44.700 --> 13:46.952
you are HR at times.

13:46.952 --> 13:48.829
If you can do that
within those four walls,

13:48.829 --> 13:50.873
imagine what you can do outside of that.

13:50.873 --> 13:53.667
<i>Worst case scenario for the future of food</i>

13:53.667 --> 13:55.711
<i>is that there aren't any people</i>

13:55.711 --> 13:57.713
<i>pushing this industry forward.</i>

13:57.713 --> 13:59.381
You have the same people
driving the force.

13:59.381 --> 14:01.258
You have the same people
controlling the narrative.

14:01.258 --> 14:04.261
<i>And if we remain the same,
then we're in a bad position.</i>

14:12.060 --> 14:13.896
Welcome to Cooking With Chang!

14:14.813 --> 14:16.815
Got my friend Kwame Onwuachi here.

14:17.774 --> 14:20.110
We're about to cultural appropriate
the shit out of this food.

14:23.071 --> 14:26.200
<i>He's been called
a rock star redefining the industry.</i>

14:26.200 --> 14:29.161
<i>He's a</i> Top Chef <i>alum
and the founder of Kith and Kin</i>

14:29.161 --> 14:30.412
right down here in DC at the wharf.

14:30.412 --> 14:32.956
‐ And he has just written
an incredible memoir.

14:33.582 --> 14:35.667
<i>Kwame's started a media company.</i>

14:35.667 --> 14:37.586
He's writing, I don't know,

14:37.586 --> 14:39.254
two cookbooks simultaneously.

14:39.254 --> 14:42.466
Any way he can express himself
that's not within a restaurant,

14:42.466 --> 14:43.550
that's what he's doing.

14:45.302 --> 14:46.887
We're doing octopus Veracruz.

14:46.887 --> 14:47.930
I'm just gonna marinate this

14:48.680 --> 14:50.307
while we work on the other stuff.

14:52.392 --> 14:57.314
This dish I had for my next menu
for Kith and Kin,

14:57.314 --> 14:58.398
but then I left the restaurant.

14:58.398 --> 15:00.442
So it never‐‐ never saw the light of day.

15:00.442 --> 15:03.278
I really love Veracruzan cuisine.

15:03.278 --> 15:05.405
It's one of the places

15:05.405 --> 15:08.992
in Mexico that has
an Afro‐Cuban influence.

15:09.409 --> 15:12.663
Alright, so this compote's
got a lot going on.

15:12.663 --> 15:15.499
It's pretty much all your traditional
things in a Veracruz sauce.

15:15.499 --> 15:18.585
‐ This has all the elements
of something that

15:18.585 --> 15:21.839
I learned how to cook without
ever having gone to Veracruz.

15:21.839 --> 15:24.591
I think, for me,
I learned that when a dish tells a story,

15:24.591 --> 15:25.717
it has a soul.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.427
You're not just
cooking for perfect seasoning.

15:27.845 --> 15:30.264
You're cooking to share a story
with someone, share some nostalgia.

15:40.440 --> 15:41.942
‐ That's awesome!
‐ It's good?

15:41.942 --> 15:44.361
You are creating stories from you,

15:44.361 --> 15:47.823
and people, being in a Black chef in
America, where those stories haven't

15:47.823 --> 15:50.742
even really been told in restaurant
ends, let alone now,

15:50.742 --> 15:52.870
you're just creating content
still in different mediums.

15:53.328 --> 15:55.539
‐ I think chefs have to realize
that they have a platform,

15:55.539 --> 15:57.082
and they can do something
with that platform,

15:57.082 --> 15:58.625
and it's not really relying

15:58.625 --> 16:01.295
on anybody else's definition of a chef.

16:01.295 --> 16:03.714
It's what's your definition of a chef
and what do you wanna do.

16:03.714 --> 16:05.716
What do you wanna see
this industry become?

16:05.716 --> 16:07.718
Fuck the status quo.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.803
‐ You said it. I agree.

16:13.348 --> 16:16.143
<i>People that work in restaurants
are just scrappy as fuck.</i>

16:16.143 --> 16:19.188
<i>Whether you're in front of the house
or back of the house,</i>

16:19.188 --> 16:20.772
<i>we're resilient. We're gritty,</i>

16:20.772 --> 16:23.442
and everybody's pivoted to delivery,

16:23.442 --> 16:27.321
to putting tables outside, whatever needs
to happen to make ends meet.

16:29.323 --> 16:31.658
I think that things are
gonna continue to pivot.

16:35.329 --> 16:37.122
<i>I mean, in 2020,</i>

16:37.122 --> 16:42.711
<i>Reem's was
a traditional fine casual restaurant.</i>

16:43.128 --> 16:45.297
<i>And when the pandemic hit,</i>

16:45.297 --> 16:47.716
I had this epiphany that

16:47.716 --> 16:49.718
I didn't have to be alone,

16:49.718 --> 16:52.262
and that there's this whole
community around me.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.517
<i>Our restaurant workers,</i>

16:56.517 --> 16:58.852
<i>most of those are people of color,</i>

16:58.852 --> 17:00.854
<i>low income communities,</i>

17:00.854 --> 17:03.774
<i>immigrants, undocumented folks.</i>

17:03.774 --> 17:06.151
<i>A lot of my team members, they wanna
do something,</i>

17:06.151 --> 17:08.904
<i>they wanna be of service
to community,</i>

17:08.904 --> 17:11.365
<i>and I think
food places are just that.</i>

17:13.700 --> 17:17.579
<i>So we said, you know what? We are
gonna turn into a commissary kitchen.</i>

17:17.579 --> 17:20.207
<i>You know, at first, it was about keeping
us afloat, but then,</i>

17:20.207 --> 17:24.169
<i>it was about sort of fulfilling
this vision that Reem's had.</i>

17:24.169 --> 17:26.380
Building resilient community
through nourishing food,

17:26.380 --> 17:27.798
no matter what, you know?

17:27.798 --> 17:30.342
It doesn't have to be
in this traditional sense.

17:30.843 --> 17:32.719
This has two more minutes to go.

17:33.595 --> 17:35.138
Looks good. I'm gonna take it out.

17:35.848 --> 17:37.891
<i>The biggest model change for us</i>

17:37.891 --> 17:39.893
<i>was internally, operationally,</i>

17:39.893 --> 17:42.104
<i>and now, we're in a worker‐owned model.</i>

17:44.147 --> 17:46.358
<i>Worker ownership really means that</i>

17:46.358 --> 17:49.820
<i>the people who add value to your business,
the workers,</i>

17:49.820 --> 17:52.239
<i>have ownership of the profits</i>

17:52.239 --> 17:54.366
<i>that they are yielding for the company,</i>

17:54.366 --> 17:58.412
and they have a say in the decisions
that the business makes

17:58.412 --> 18:01.415
that obviously impacts their lives.

18:02.040 --> 18:04.543
<i>It's really about creating
a system in which</i>

18:04.543 --> 18:07.254
<i>people are looking at
the collective wellbeing</i>

18:07.254 --> 18:10.299
<i>rather than their own
individual wellbeing.</i>

18:14.052 --> 18:16.054
‐ Food is populist,

18:16.054 --> 18:18.390
at the end of the day.
‐ Food is populist.

18:19.266 --> 18:20.767
Are restaurants populist?

18:21.560 --> 18:24.855
‐ I spent a lifetime thinking that
I was feeding a lot of people.
‐ Yeah.

18:25.772 --> 18:27.357
‐ And I think this pandemic,

18:27.357 --> 18:29.443
and the aftermath of it,

18:29.443 --> 18:31.862
has shown me that
we have really fed nobody.

18:31.862 --> 18:34.823
We do, but it's not a lot comparatively.

18:34.823 --> 18:37.409
It's feeding a small
subsect of your community.

18:40.412 --> 18:42.664
<i>Feeding as many people as possible</i>

18:42.664 --> 18:44.291
<i>seems like it's easy, but it's not.</i>

18:46.251 --> 18:48.337
<i>And I think the transition
from high‐end dining</i>

18:49.463 --> 18:52.674
<i>to fast service is, in some ways,</i>

18:52.674 --> 18:55.677
the equivalent of pop art
or something like that. It's...

18:57.471 --> 18:59.306
There's more to that

18:59.306 --> 19:00.974
to make food accessible

19:00.974 --> 19:03.769
than just to have it appreciated
by a select few people.

19:05.187 --> 19:07.231
Strange days.
‐ Very strange days.

19:07.231 --> 19:10.108
I... You know, I'm a hopeful guy.
I think it's gonna get better.

19:10.108 --> 19:12.069
‐ I'm a very hopeful person.

19:15.113 --> 19:17.574
<i>JJ, he was in fine dining.</i>

19:17.574 --> 19:20.953
<i>He was running the Cecil. He won a Beard
Award for his cookbook. And then,</i>

19:20.953 --> 19:22.955
<i>he decided to change it up.</i>

19:24.748 --> 19:27.042
A lot of people, foodies,

19:27.042 --> 19:28.877
would say, "what a waste of talent

19:28.877 --> 19:32.422
that this person wants to just
open up something so mainstream."

19:33.298 --> 19:34.925
I'm like, what's wrong with that?

19:34.925 --> 19:36.593
Fieldtrip...

19:37.219 --> 19:39.930
is about your exploration of rice,

19:39.930 --> 19:41.640
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
‐ ...your heritage,

19:41.640 --> 19:44.518
your culture.
‐ So, we all grown up on a rice culture.

19:44.518 --> 19:47.604
Either a rice dish or a rice grain,

19:48.105 --> 19:50.524
<i>and I look at rice as that connector that</i>

19:50.524 --> 19:51.775
<i>hopefully connects everybody.</i>

19:51.775 --> 19:54.736
‐ You think you have
a better quality of life cooking this way?

19:54.736 --> 19:56.655
‐ I have a better quality
of life cooking this way.

19:56.655 --> 19:59.366
It's still long days, but it's not like

19:59.366 --> 20:01.827
we're getting off at
2:00 in the morning, right?

20:01.827 --> 20:04.621
‐ Alright, man. Well,
what are we gonna make then?

20:04.621 --> 20:05.706
‐ So, one of my favorite dishes.

20:06.748 --> 20:09.501
<i>Pineapple black fried rice,
collard greens,</i>

20:09.501 --> 20:10.460
<i>some steamed salmon,</i>

20:10.460 --> 20:12.963
<i>and then peri peri sauce from West Africa.</i>

20:14.256 --> 20:17.050
This is the future.
I mean, just you doing this.

20:18.635 --> 20:22.931
Black guy using a wok,
at 30 Rock...

20:22.931 --> 20:24.683
I got... I see...

20:24.683 --> 20:28.145
flavors from all over the world!
Flavors from all over the world.

20:29.021 --> 20:31.273
This makes me happy, man.

20:31.940 --> 20:35.777
<i>I think change for JJ
to fast food or quick service</i>

20:35.777 --> 20:38.906
<i>is an important one because, clearly,</i>

20:38.906 --> 20:41.575
<i>he's still making food
in the high‐end fashion.</i>

20:41.575 --> 20:45.162
<i>It's just now done
in a way where you don't have to spend</i>

20:45.162 --> 20:48.624
<i>70, 80, $100. You can get a $12 bowl.</i>

20:48.624 --> 20:52.961
To me, I think that is one of
the most exciting things you can do.

20:54.087 --> 20:55.547
Beautiful.

21:03.639 --> 21:05.557
This is so...

21:06.266 --> 21:07.893
delicious, man. This is...

21:08.810 --> 21:10.270
fine dining cooking.

21:10.270 --> 21:11.647
So much depth, so much flavor.

21:12.231 --> 21:14.816
‐ If you can figure out how to
cook that food from fine dining

21:14.816 --> 21:17.069
and make it accessible and delicious

21:17.069 --> 21:19.071
and price point is good,

21:19.071 --> 21:20.405
then I think it's a home run.

21:20.405 --> 21:21.990
It doesn't feel different.

21:21.990 --> 21:23.867
It just is in a different space.

21:23.867 --> 21:26.703
And I look at that as
a great thing for the future.

21:38.882 --> 21:40.384
So excited.

21:40.801 --> 21:44.179
This is a place
that I used to come a lot.

21:48.183 --> 21:51.812
I don't even know how the hell I found
this place because it wasn't easy to find.

21:51.812 --> 21:55.649
This is a place that I would
come after I lived in Japan.

21:55.649 --> 21:59.069
I was like, wow, this is like
I've been transported to Japan.

22:01.697 --> 22:03.365
<i>Sakagura and restaurants like that</i>

22:03.365 --> 22:05.409
are very common in Asia.

22:05.409 --> 22:07.703
<i>And I think that,</i>

22:07.703 --> 22:12.249
<i>as America develops
a richer food culture</i>

22:12.249 --> 22:14.543
<i>where it's not so based on real estate,</i>

22:14.543 --> 22:16.879
you're gonna see more places like Sakagura

22:16.879 --> 22:18.755
<i>because you're literally walking through</i>

22:18.755 --> 22:20.674
<i>some building from college,</i>

22:20.674 --> 22:21.800
and then you go downstairs,
and you're like,

22:21.800 --> 22:23.719
"whoa, check out this party."
It's awesome.

22:24.386 --> 22:26.805
And it's cheaper. Everyone says
"real estate, real estate, real estate."

22:26.805 --> 22:29.057
Yeah, but it doesn't
necessarily have to be

22:29.057 --> 22:30.976
the most prime A+ location.

22:32.644 --> 22:34.188
I grew up in northern Virginia,

22:34.188 --> 22:36.523
and you don't find
restaurants in a basement.

22:37.399 --> 22:39.735
Right? Yeah.
‐ Of an office building yeah. Yeah.

22:39.735 --> 22:42.571
There's a term,
"underground economy".

22:42.571 --> 22:46.491
The idea that you always have, you know,

22:46.491 --> 22:49.786
subnetworks that exist underneath...

22:50.704 --> 22:52.414
whatever's happening officially.

22:52.414 --> 22:55.542
You know, we're talking about basically
experiences of leisure.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.002
We're talking about

22:57.002 --> 22:59.254
opportunities to kick back
and relax.

22:59.254 --> 23:01.215
And I think for people of color,

23:01.215 --> 23:03.008
and especially for Black people
in this country,

23:03.008 --> 23:05.427
those experiences have
always been politicized.

23:05.844 --> 23:08.972
So, if you could have a space
where you could be at ease,

23:09.389 --> 23:12.309
you could chill the fuck out, you know?

23:12.309 --> 23:15.479
You could laugh, joke,

23:15.479 --> 23:18.607
be celebrated in some way,

23:18.607 --> 23:21.401
I mean, who wouldn't
wanna keep that underground?

23:22.277 --> 23:25.822
I mean, the only thing
that I grew up knowing that

23:25.822 --> 23:28.325
where restaurants aren't supposed
to be was when I found

23:28.325 --> 23:31.411
Asian restaurants in places where
they were in White places.

23:32.996 --> 23:34.540
<i>I remember going to DC</i>

23:34.540 --> 23:35.958
<i>because my dad wanted to take us</i>

23:35.958 --> 23:38.252
<i>to a fancy Korean barbecue place.</i>

23:38.252 --> 23:42.673
<i>It was in a fancy part of Washington, DC.
And that was like, "wow.</i>

23:42.673 --> 23:45.592
That's not supposed to be here. We're su‐‐
You actually thought that?

23:45.592 --> 23:48.220
‐ Yeah! I remember being like, "We're not
supposed to be here. This is weird."

23:48.679 --> 23:53.058
I didn't really think about that till
I started to travel, and I was like, wait.

23:53.058 --> 23:54.977
Outside of America...

23:54.977 --> 23:57.062
There's something very American that

23:57.062 --> 24:00.023
we're sort of brought up
to have the restaurants

24:00.023 --> 24:02.568
that you expect in certain locations.

24:02.568 --> 24:05.946
‐ Part of what compels me to want to

24:05.946 --> 24:08.490
deconstruct these belief systems

24:08.490 --> 24:11.660
that had you as a <i>boy</i> saying,

24:11.660 --> 24:15.247
"My people don't belong in this place."

24:15.247 --> 24:17.416
Like, who the fuck told you that!?

24:18.166 --> 24:21.670
I grieve for that little Chang!

24:22.462 --> 24:25.424
Because there's so many other
people experiencing that.

24:25.924 --> 24:29.845
As people are more knowledgeable
about food and a lot of the old standing

24:29.845 --> 24:33.515
stupid ways of how we thought
about food disappear,

24:35.309 --> 24:37.477
maybe one of which is

24:37.477 --> 24:39.313
where and how you eat.

24:48.864 --> 24:51.950
<i>I think the definition of
a restaurant has been changing.</i>

24:52.659 --> 24:54.953
<i>I don't think that it has to be</i>

24:54.953 --> 24:57.873
<i>within a certain city</i>

24:57.873 --> 25:02.211
<i>or doesn't have to be within four walls.</i>

25:02.211 --> 25:04.004
It can be in a house.

25:04.004 --> 25:06.757
It can be in an Airstream.

25:06.757 --> 25:09.718
It can be in a cabin in the woods.

25:10.677 --> 25:13.472
<i>I created a little bed and breakfast.</i>

25:13.472 --> 25:15.807
<i>It's a little bit of outfitting</i>

25:15.807 --> 25:17.768
<i>and outdoors experience</i>

25:17.768 --> 25:21.688
<i>and like a resort
and a restaurant, all in one.</i>

25:24.775 --> 25:27.569
‐ A restaurant, to me, is a place where

25:27.569 --> 25:29.947
you're inviting people
in to be comfortable

25:30.781 --> 25:32.449
<i>and to experience something beautiful.</i>

25:33.909 --> 25:36.203
<i>It used to be,
"oh, they're in this part of town.</i>

25:36.203 --> 25:37.996
<i>They're next to this building." It's like,</i>

25:37.996 --> 25:40.666
that used to matter,
but I've also waited in line in, like,

25:40.666 --> 25:43.460
some of the worst parts of town
you'd never really wanna go to

25:43.460 --> 25:44.461
for some good food.

25:45.838 --> 25:48.882
<i>Doing things like pop‐ups
and ghost kitchens</i>

25:48.882 --> 25:50.509
<i>and street food,</i>

25:50.509 --> 25:53.053
<i>that's been really
exciting to see how people</i>

25:53.053 --> 25:55.764
shift the way we look at dining

25:55.764 --> 25:58.517
and what a dining experience is.

25:59.476 --> 26:01.228
<i>I think street food is a restaurant.</i>

26:01.228 --> 26:03.730
I know a lot of people who are
gonna kill me on that and say,

26:03.730 --> 26:05.941
"That's not a restaurant!
You have to have hospitality,

26:05.941 --> 26:08.193
service, create that experience."

26:08.193 --> 26:10.279
It's a vibe when you're on the street,

26:10.279 --> 26:13.240
<i>and you're waiting in line.
It's a huge vibe.</i>

26:13.240 --> 26:15.742
It has to be the right location
for what you're doing.

26:15.742 --> 26:17.911
‐ I do have a lot of friends
who have invested

26:17.911 --> 26:20.080
tons of money into opening
a brick‐and‐mortar.

26:20.914 --> 26:24.168
<i>It's just insane how much
you have to put out there</i>

26:24.168 --> 26:26.211
before you're able to live that dream.

26:26.795 --> 26:28.422
<i>Some of the best restaurants in the world</i>

26:28.422 --> 26:30.841
<i>are places that are in</i>

26:30.841 --> 26:34.136
<i>the worst locations humanly possible.</i>

26:34.136 --> 26:37.514
For food to
be more accessible

26:37.514 --> 26:43.020
and to give people that want
to open up their own spot an opportunity,

26:43.020 --> 26:45.856
you gotta free up the flow of real estate.

26:54.198 --> 26:56.700
You've been here before?
I have not
been out here before.

26:56.700 --> 26:59.494
I've been to his other pop‐up,
but this is crazy.

26:59.494 --> 27:01.872
Sup, dude? How you doing?
What's going on, man?

27:01.872 --> 27:03.373
Hey.

27:03.373 --> 27:05.709
How are you, my friend?
‐ Great to finally meet you, man.

27:07.085 --> 27:09.379
I just wasn't expecting this setup.
It's amazing,

27:09.379 --> 27:10.547
and it's here.

27:10.547 --> 27:13.008
<i>Like...</i>

27:13.008 --> 27:15.511
<i>this can't happen in
many places in America.</i>

27:16.303 --> 27:17.763
<i>No, you can't. I mean,</i>

27:17.763 --> 27:20.516
we're right here, right across
from the recycling plant.

27:20.516 --> 27:23.602
There's a lot of history,
there's a lot of heritage,
culture here.

27:23.602 --> 27:25.103
I mean, West Oakland,

27:25.103 --> 27:27.898
you think about it, it's the last stop
of the great Black migration.

27:27.898 --> 27:29.900
‐ This is so cool. I love...

27:30.317 --> 27:33.195
the recycling noise.

27:33.195 --> 27:35.364
Zero fucks. It's amazing.
It's so good.

27:35.364 --> 27:37.366
The future is...

27:38.242 --> 27:40.369
restaurants need to be able
to work within cities.

27:40.369 --> 27:42.996
You can't be like, not every restaurant
can be perched on a cliff

27:42.996 --> 27:44.456
overlooking the ocean

27:44.456 --> 27:47.251
with a beautiful view of whatever,
whatever, whatever.
Right, right.

27:47.251 --> 27:48.752
‐ You gotta serve food

27:48.752 --> 27:50.254
<i>where the people are.</i>

27:51.255 --> 27:53.048
<i>You look at this, there's picnic tables.</i>

27:53.048 --> 27:54.758
<i>This is a celebration of community,</i>

27:54.758 --> 27:57.761
<i>and that's what dining out is all about.
Right. Absolutely.
That's what it's about.</i>

27:58.595 --> 28:00.222
Alright, talk to us, man.
So,

28:00.973 --> 28:02.850
when I first got started in barbecue,

28:02.850 --> 28:06.728
my focus was
try to put out the best
proteins that I can.

28:06.728 --> 28:09.481
<i>I wanted to pay tribute to
those that come before me,</i>

28:09.481 --> 28:11.233
<i>the shoulders of which I stand on.</i>

28:11.233 --> 28:15.362
I teach my guys to use
their hands and feel and look at it.

28:15.988 --> 28:18.949
I know it's weird,
I say this all the time, it's like

28:18.949 --> 28:21.285
you wanna become one
with what you're doing.

28:21.285 --> 28:23.453
Fuck, man.

28:23.453 --> 28:25.873
‐ Dave hasn't said
anything for seven minutes.

28:27.875 --> 28:29.001
‐ This is when it's good, man.

28:29.001 --> 28:31.628
Why talk when the food is this good, man?
Thanks.

28:31.628 --> 28:34.131
Great barbecue is
about how much you love it.

28:34.131 --> 28:36.091
That's it. It's how much you love it,

28:36.091 --> 28:38.010
and that's why I'm tasting this.
It's like...

28:38.010 --> 28:40.762
you're tasting love, and I know
that sounds cheesy, man,

28:40.762 --> 28:43.724
but that's what makes
this brisket so delicious.

28:44.099 --> 28:47.311
I mean, it's extremely important.
It's more than just us being here,

28:47.311 --> 28:48.687
operating a restaurant here.

28:48.687 --> 28:50.939
It's like how
are we impacting our community?

28:50.939 --> 28:53.233
Are we the great neighbor
within our community?

28:53.233 --> 28:55.944
Are we actively taking the steps
to be able to empower

28:55.944 --> 28:59.072
the people that
create this community?

28:59.072 --> 29:01.074
It's a sense of responsibility.

29:01.742 --> 29:03.452
<i>If you just don't even taste the food,</i>

29:03.452 --> 29:06.872
<i>and clearly it's outrageously
good, it's amazing.</i>

29:07.372 --> 29:10.167
But, if you just,
sort of look at this operation,

29:10.167 --> 29:13.170
how do you not be inspired by the future?

29:19.968 --> 29:21.637
<i>We need to</i>

29:21.637 --> 29:25.265
really lock into what changes were
made because of the pandemic

29:25.265 --> 29:28.352
and how it can better the industry.

29:29.603 --> 29:32.648
<i>It's up to all of our individual
responsibilities to take a second look</i>

29:32.648 --> 29:35.150
at the way we do things
and to make sure that...

29:35.943 --> 29:38.278
we're not doing it at the expense
of someone else.

29:38.987 --> 29:40.864
<i>I mean, I'm terrified</i>

29:40.864 --> 29:42.783
of things going back to status quo.

29:42.783 --> 29:47.079
It's why I'm fighting so hard
while we have the moment

29:47.079 --> 29:49.289
to shift people before people forget.

29:49.748 --> 29:54.127
‐ We have to set aside this idea
of toxic individualism

29:54.127 --> 29:57.965
and realize that the only way
we can create space for people to try

29:57.965 --> 30:01.301
<i>things that are exciting and humane</i>

30:01.301 --> 30:04.513
<i>and that move us forward,
right, as people who create</i>

30:04.513 --> 30:08.225
or as people who consume,
is if we have room to fail.

30:09.685 --> 30:13.522
‐ I think people are now
accepting that change is inevitable

30:13.522 --> 30:16.692
and nothing's gonna look
like how it was once before,

30:16.692 --> 30:19.111
and that's okay,
and it's actually quite exciting.

30:22.239 --> 30:24.283
<i>I was not anticipating</i>

30:24.283 --> 30:26.869
<i>to have hope and light</i>

30:26.869 --> 30:29.413
in filming this

30:29.413 --> 30:32.291
because while we may lose the middle tier

30:32.291 --> 30:34.126
in the traditional sense,

30:35.502 --> 30:37.087
that's gonna transform
into something else.

30:40.883 --> 30:43.969
<i>I think the mid‐market restaurant</i>

30:43.969 --> 30:46.388
<i>will now be the domain of home.</i>

30:48.932 --> 30:51.643
<i>You get food delivered at home,
you cook at home,</i>

30:52.352 --> 30:55.022
but I think one of the things
that hopefully will happen

30:55.022 --> 30:57.524
is you'll be able to serve food

30:57.524 --> 30:59.484
out of your home as a business.

31:04.281 --> 31:07.326
<i>I've been doing
food service for about 25 years,</i>

31:07.326 --> 31:10.537
and when COVID hit last year,

31:10.537 --> 31:13.624
someone told me, "Hey, you should
do your food. We miss it."

31:14.833 --> 31:17.544
<i>This is a good way to serve the community</i>

31:17.544 --> 31:19.922
<i>and have sustainability for ourselves.</i>

31:25.260 --> 31:27.179
We have quesabirrias.

31:28.180 --> 31:29.848
Here we have potato tacos.

31:29.848 --> 31:31.850
Lucy, this looks extreme.

31:33.644 --> 31:35.521
I mean, come on. This is amazing.

31:40.526 --> 31:41.735
Holy shit.

31:41.735 --> 31:43.612
This is stupid.

31:43.612 --> 31:45.113
I can't believe this food
is being made here.

31:45.113 --> 31:46.907
I mean, I can, but...

31:46.907 --> 31:48.700
this is awesome.

31:49.660 --> 31:51.119
This is extraordinary.

31:51.119 --> 31:52.579
‐ Thank you.

31:52.579 --> 31:54.706
‐ If I read about Barra de Pan,

31:54.706 --> 31:56.375
"How do I make a reservation?"

31:56.375 --> 31:58.043
Foodnome is an app

31:58.043 --> 32:00.671
that allows you to order from

32:00.671 --> 32:02.297
permanent home‐based restaurants

32:02.297 --> 32:04.341
<i>across southern California.</i>

32:04.341 --> 32:07.261
We have 100 restaurants
on our platform right now.

32:07.261 --> 32:08.971
We just got the law approved in Berkeley

32:08.971 --> 32:11.098
and working on some legislation

32:11.098 --> 32:13.892
in Washington state and Utah
and like a few other places.

32:14.601 --> 32:17.938
There's a lot of implications for this
in terms of food deserts.

32:17.938 --> 32:19.481
Here in Riverside,

32:19.481 --> 32:21.525
there's McDonald's and an Applebee's.

32:21.525 --> 32:23.235
<i>On Foodnome,</i>

32:23.235 --> 32:25.529
<i>there's homemade Haitian food,
northern Chinese food,</i>

32:25.529 --> 32:27.489
<i>and Guatemalan food.</i>

32:27.489 --> 32:29.575
And so, all these people
live in the community,

32:29.575 --> 32:32.327
and they can share their
cultures and traditions.

32:32.327 --> 32:35.330
‐ It gives us new chefs a way to...

32:36.832 --> 32:40.460
sort of gauge ourselves,
what we can do and what we're capable of.

32:40.794 --> 32:43.547
‐ I'm so sick and tired of seeing

32:43.547 --> 32:45.632
my friends and my peer group

32:45.632 --> 32:48.093
lose their shirt because...

32:48.093 --> 32:49.845
they've had to put everything
up to get a loan.

32:50.512 --> 32:52.306
And the restaurant...

32:53.098 --> 32:55.475
disappeared because
of a variety of things,

32:55.475 --> 32:57.686
and especially this year,
so many restaurants closed,

32:57.686 --> 32:59.438
and they're left with nothing.
‐ Yeah.

32:59.438 --> 33:02.482
‐ And this is an amazing way
to mitigate a lot of that risk.

33:04.651 --> 33:07.571
Is that mole?
‐ That mole, it's mole poblano.

33:07.571 --> 33:10.866
So, that's my mom's recipe.
‐ That is bananas.

33:10.866 --> 33:13.243
So good. Holy cow.

33:13.243 --> 33:16.163
‐ So, the mole poblano is my mom's recipe.
I make it all the time.

33:16.163 --> 33:17.748
My daughters love it.

33:17.748 --> 33:20.125
‐ I mean, this is one of the best pozoles

33:20.125 --> 33:22.085
I've ever had.
Oh wow, I'm honored.

33:22.085 --> 33:24.087
I am really, truly honored.

33:24.630 --> 33:27.758
We've been on
this crazy journey, all of us,

33:27.758 --> 33:31.929
during COVID, and the restaurant industry
is very difficult.

33:31.929 --> 33:33.805
It was difficult before COVID,

33:34.681 --> 33:38.101
and things are more
murky than ever before,

33:38.101 --> 33:40.229
and I have been, oftentimes,

33:40.229 --> 33:42.397
in incredibly dark places,
thinking about this.

33:42.856 --> 33:45.108
But, no‐‐ no BS,

33:45.108 --> 33:46.860
this is incredibly inspiring.

33:47.611 --> 33:48.820
I just...

33:49.363 --> 33:50.989
I hope that this is the future.

33:55.035 --> 33:56.954
<i>Pre‐pandemic,
I saw a lot of broken dreams,</i>

33:56.954 --> 33:59.623
a lot of broken bodies, a lot of...

34:00.457 --> 34:01.875
empty bank accounts.

34:02.668 --> 34:06.004
<i>I think for myself,
I'm never going to leave,</i>

34:06.505 --> 34:09.216
but I'd like to have
a little bit better balance

34:09.216 --> 34:12.427
<i>in being home for bath time</i>

34:12.427 --> 34:13.595
<i>and put down my son.</i>

34:13.595 --> 34:15.222
<i>Those are moments
I'm never gonna have again,</i>

34:15.222 --> 34:19.142
and honestly, I never
would've done any of this stuff

34:19.142 --> 34:20.686
if I was just working all the time.

34:21.520 --> 34:24.273
<i>There's a lot of us that are like
there's more to life.</i>

34:24.773 --> 34:26.942
<i>There's different ways to run a business,</i>

34:26.942 --> 34:29.820
<i>it doesn't have to be within
the four walls of a restaurant.</i>

34:30.821 --> 34:32.573
<i>And that's where I'm actually
incredibly positive</i>

34:32.573 --> 34:35.826
<i>about what is possible.</i>

34:35.826 --> 34:36.910
This is a great time.

34:36.910 --> 34:40.080
If I was younger and in my 20s,

34:41.415 --> 34:43.876
I'd be like, "this is fucking amazing."

34:43.876 --> 34:45.294
You're gonna see so much
innovation.

34:45.294 --> 34:48.463
I really hope you're gonna see people
take some big swings

34:48.463 --> 34:49.882
and try to do something new and different.

34:51.800 --> 34:53.135
<i>Restaurants aren't going away,</i>

34:53.135 --> 34:56.597
<i>but there's more ways of eating
food than there have ever been.</i>

34:56.597 --> 34:59.099
‐ Are you hopeful? I'm shocked actually.

35:00.559 --> 35:04.354
‐ It needed to blow up.
It needed to implode, right?

35:04.354 --> 35:07.107
This year has been incredibly difficult,

35:08.567 --> 35:10.319
but I am genuinely optimistic

35:10.319 --> 35:12.237
for what's around the corner.

35:12.237 --> 35:15.616
Why I am optimistic about it
is I have no fucking idea.
