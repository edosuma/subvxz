[theme music playing]

01:25.668 --> 01:28.671
- [EKG beeping]
- [IV dripping]

01:36.763 --> 01:39.933
[Jessica] Chasing your dreams
can be deadly.

01:41.518 --> 01:43.645
Especially when a creep
with a science hard-on

01:43.728 --> 01:45.188
promises to make them real.

01:48.066 --> 01:49.275
Is she in pain?

01:49.359 --> 01:50.860
[doctor] She's heavily sedated.

01:50.944 --> 01:55.365
The spasms are a symptom of surges
of electrical activity in her brain.

01:55.448 --> 01:58.910
Frankly, we're still trying to understand
what happened to her.

01:58.993 --> 02:01.162
An asshole happened to her.

02:01.246 --> 02:02.997
[doctor] I've heard about guys like that.

02:03.081 --> 02:06.626
Back alley doctors preying on people
who want powers. It's sickening.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.669
So this has happened to other people?

02:08.752 --> 02:10.088
A few that we know of.

02:10.880 --> 02:12.465
Other than what you told us,

02:12.549 --> 02:15.051
we don't really know
what's happening to her.

02:15.135 --> 02:17.137
[Dorothy] How long will she be like this?

02:17.220 --> 02:19.681
[doctor] We don't know
when she'll come out of it.

02:19.764 --> 02:21.015
If she'll come out of it.

02:21.099 --> 02:23.351
We just have to be patient for now.

02:27.438 --> 02:29.315
[Dorothy sighing] Oh, God.

02:33.027 --> 02:35.780
[Jessica] Go ahead. Say it.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.449
I'm the reason
that she's obsessed with powers.

02:38.950 --> 02:39.784
Jessie...

02:39.868 --> 02:42.787
Getting involved with my shit
was bound to get her killed.

02:45.498 --> 02:46.916
I don't blame you.

02:49.586 --> 02:52.922
You have for 17 years. Why stop now?

02:53.006 --> 02:55.091
Because my daughter could die.

02:55.174 --> 02:56.634
Gives me perspective.

02:58.636 --> 03:02.557
Patsy always wanted to be extraordinary.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.310
You just showed her
what that might look like.

03:06.060 --> 03:07.812
I should've seen this coming.

03:07.896 --> 03:12.859
When Pats wants something...
[sighs] she's pretty unstoppable.

03:13.818 --> 03:17.530
And blaming ourselves now is pointless.

03:18.072 --> 03:20.366
If, God forbid, we should lose her,

03:21.826 --> 03:24.996
you and I are the only family
we have left.

03:28.249 --> 03:30.084
[cell phone vibrating]

03:31.502 --> 03:32.670
I gotta take this.

03:36.841 --> 03:38.092
Costa, what is it?

03:38.176 --> 03:40.511
[Costa] Something's happened.
We need to talk.

03:41.221 --> 03:42.847
[truck beeping]

03:50.396 --> 03:51.606
[thudding]

03:54.692 --> 03:57.195
Hey, is somebody in there?

04:04.535 --> 04:05.745
[grunts]

04:15.171 --> 04:16.422
Please don't hurt me.

05:10.268 --> 05:11.894
[breathing heavily]

05:23.948 --> 05:25.199
[grunts]

05:40.590 --> 05:44.677
Yo. What are you, a fan?
I got one in the truck with no rips in it.

05:48.639 --> 05:49.639
No.

05:59.358 --> 06:03.112
[Jessica] She isn't running.
There isn't anywhere else to run to.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.031
- Your childhood home?
- She hated it there.

06:05.114 --> 06:08.242
- An old friend she might reach out to?
- [sighs] There was no one.

06:08.326 --> 06:10.995
She always ended up pissing off all
of her friends.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.414
[Costa] Family? A relative somewhere?

06:13.498 --> 06:15.333
- Karl was her family.
- And you.

06:15.416 --> 06:17.877
Okay, Karl's gone.
Where would she go if she was upset?

06:17.960 --> 06:19.629
- I don't know.
- You're stalling us.

06:19.712 --> 06:21.464
I'm trying to help you bring her in.

06:21.547 --> 06:24.509
She should've gone to The Raft.
Whoever she hurts next, that's on you.

06:24.592 --> 06:26.761
Sunday, give her some space.

06:28.930 --> 06:30.223
I'm not protecting her.

06:30.306 --> 06:32.642
But you know her. Better than anyone.

06:32.725 --> 06:33.726
No, I don't.

06:35.186 --> 06:36.521
But Karl does.

06:40.733 --> 06:42.360
[Costa] You wanna share
with the class?

06:42.443 --> 06:44.153
It's Karl's journal or blog or whatever.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.489
Otherwise known as evidence.

06:47.031 --> 06:48.199
Where'd you get that?

06:48.282 --> 06:51.077
Family shit has a way
of catching up with me.

06:51.661 --> 06:54.539
"Patient experiences
dissociative episodes,

06:54.622 --> 06:57.250
often marked
by an obsessive destructive fixation

06:57.333 --> 06:59.293
on a singular object or person."

07:04.715 --> 07:06.676
Sorry, ma'am,
we're in the middle of a live show.

07:07.552 --> 07:09.137
Are you in the right place?

07:11.055 --> 07:13.808
Uh, if you'd like a tour,

07:14.767 --> 07:18.646
just head down the hallway
and have reception help you.

07:18.729 --> 07:22.150
Thank you for being a fan.
Let's get you a tote bag.

07:22.233 --> 07:23.734
[grunts]

07:23.818 --> 07:25.111
[screams]

07:30.700 --> 07:32.743
[Jessica] I think
she might go after Trish.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.204
- [Costa] Why?
- [Jessica] It makes sense.

07:35.288 --> 07:39.417
In her mind,
Trish's investigation ruined her life.

07:39.500 --> 07:42.962
Forced her to kill all of those people
to protect him.

07:43.796 --> 07:47.216
She probably thinks that Trish
is also responsible for Karl's death.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.510
- Is she?
- No. I need to get to Trish.

07:49.594 --> 07:51.596
You need to stay put
in case she comes back.

07:51.679 --> 07:52.781
- She won't.
- Trish is safe.

07:52.805 --> 07:54.366
Your mother doesn't know she's
in the hospital.

07:54.390 --> 07:58.269
Costa, it's Patsy. It'll leak.

08:13.201 --> 08:17.455
Mrs. Walker? Mrs. Walker,
Thembi Wallace, WJBT News.

08:17.538 --> 08:19.738
Is it true Trish Walker's been admitted
to the hospital?

08:19.790 --> 08:20.625
No comment.

08:20.708 --> 08:23.044
Can you confirm reports
that she's had a relapse?

08:23.127 --> 08:24.253
That is a lie.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.561
Was she under the influence
when she had that meltdown on her show?

08:28.090 --> 08:29.770
Sources say her behavior has been erratic.

08:29.842 --> 08:32.970
What sources? Who... Who's saying that?

08:36.015 --> 08:40.561
The point is, I've got a story.
Another fading star loses her shit.

08:40.645 --> 08:43.063
But I'm guessing
you've got a story to tell, too.

08:44.190 --> 08:46.901
Take control of the narrative,
Mrs. Walker.

08:54.992 --> 08:57.912
[man over radio] ...vegetables,
and cutting back on high-sugar items...

08:58.621 --> 09:00.665
[crying]

09:03.876 --> 09:05.920
And we have breaking news.

09:06.003 --> 09:08.839
Trish Walker,
former child actor and radio host,

09:08.923 --> 09:11.968
has been hospitalized
and remains in critical condition.

09:12.051 --> 09:15.137
Thembi Wallace has the latest
from Mrs. Walker's mother.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.557
Patsy's fans know she's a fighter.

09:17.640 --> 09:22.562
She has influenced so many people
with her resilience.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.231
She's getting the best care.

09:25.314 --> 09:29.277
And I have no doubt she's gonna
come out of this stronger than ever.

09:29.360 --> 09:32.071
[Thembi] Why was she admitted
to Riverbank Medical?

09:32.154 --> 09:35.366
[Dorothy] She went to see a new doctor
for a routine procedure

09:35.449 --> 09:39.912
and this animal, this charlatan,

09:39.996 --> 09:41.872
took advantage of my little girl.

09:41.956 --> 09:44.417
And he has left her now
in critical condition.

09:45.501 --> 09:51.465
[Thembi] Is there a message you'd like
to deliver to Patsy's worldwide fan base?

09:51.549 --> 09:55.595
Please... pray for my Patsy.

10:07.732 --> 10:09.233
Stay here. I'll be right back.

10:13.279 --> 10:14.739
[device processing]

10:37.762 --> 10:38.971
[siren blaring]

10:41.766 --> 10:44.810
What is the point of having sirens
if nobody gets out of the way?

10:45.436 --> 10:47.313
Sunday. When?

10:48.314 --> 10:50.900
32 Fifth Avenue. What is that?

10:50.983 --> 10:52.818
That's the radio station. Shit.

10:52.902 --> 10:55.237
- [Sunday] Okay, keep me posted.
- [Costa] Anybody hurt?

10:55.321 --> 10:57.448
Station manager got cut up,
but he'll live.

10:57.531 --> 10:59.033
He's on his way to the hospital now.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.826
We're gonna need backup at Riverbank.

11:00.910 --> 11:05.456
I'm telling you, if she sees cops,
she will flatten anybody in her way.

11:05.539 --> 11:08.167
Your best friend's an open target.
She needs protection.

11:08.250 --> 11:12.046
Trish needs me. I can talk my mom down.

11:12.129 --> 11:14.340
I can't take that chance.
I'm calling SWAT.

11:20.179 --> 11:21.179
[sighs]

11:22.098 --> 11:23.474
We don't have time for this.

11:23.557 --> 11:27.186
We'll get there, Jones. Sit tight.
The door's staying locked.

11:28.646 --> 11:29.646
Jones!

11:32.149 --> 11:35.986
Jones! Jones, get back here! Jones!

11:36.070 --> 11:37.738
- [indistinct shouting]
- [horns honking]

11:39.782 --> 11:44.829
I can't supply you with the police report,
because I don't have a police report.

11:44.912 --> 11:47.248
Nor do I want one. I...

11:48.416 --> 11:51.127
I will buy back the stolen items

11:51.210 --> 11:53.170
and make sure
that you are generously compensated

11:53.254 --> 11:55.548
for any information you have
about the people who...

11:56.257 --> 11:57.258
What?

11:59.135 --> 12:03.264
No... I don't want a car stereo.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.140
[phone beeps off]

12:05.850 --> 12:08.727
I'm looking for a lot of things, um...

12:08.811 --> 12:10.813
a pair of celadon vases, okay?

12:10.896 --> 12:12.857
They were... They were antique.

12:14.066 --> 12:15.234
Nothing? Okay.

12:15.317 --> 12:17.570
Akoya. Triple strand.

12:19.029 --> 12:22.324
A-K-O-Y-A.

12:22.408 --> 12:25.202
Okay, how do you not know what that is?

12:27.496 --> 12:31.917
You know what? You're too stupid
to own a pawn shop. [sighs]

12:33.252 --> 12:34.753
[cell phone vibrating]

12:39.341 --> 12:40.342
Hello?

12:41.886 --> 12:43.095
Yes, that's right.

12:43.179 --> 12:47.850
Uh, an Hermès leather Birkin,
35 centimeter.

12:48.642 --> 12:49.810
Palladium hardware.

12:50.561 --> 12:52.480
[chuckles] Yeah, um...

12:54.482 --> 12:58.110
Frankie's Famous 24-Hour Pawnshop.

12:58.944 --> 12:59.944
[sighs]

13:00.404 --> 13:01.572
Are you Frankie?

13:02.448 --> 13:03.866
And where are you located?

13:06.785 --> 13:09.705
[sighs] Great, thank you so much.

13:26.722 --> 13:30.392
Whoa! Lady, you scared the shit out of me.

13:30.476 --> 13:32.895
Trish Walker. Which room?

13:32.978 --> 13:34.730
I can't give you that info.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.274
Which room?

13:54.542 --> 13:55.542
Get out.

13:57.419 --> 13:58.420
I'm not leaving.

13:58.504 --> 13:59.964
She took everything from me.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.007
She did this.

14:02.841 --> 14:04.260
You did this. You...

14:07.012 --> 14:11.308
That's just a story
that you've made up inside your head.

14:12.601 --> 14:14.645
- Just like one of your nightmares.
- [Alisa] No.

14:15.980 --> 14:16.981
But you can wake up.

14:19.775 --> 14:22.820
[both grunting]

14:22.903 --> 14:24.113
No more.

14:24.947 --> 14:26.240
[exclaiming]

14:26.323 --> 14:27.533
[grunts]

14:27.616 --> 14:29.451
- [choking]
- [Jessica] Let me go!

14:29.535 --> 14:32.621
No, stop. You've got it all wrong!

14:32.705 --> 14:35.082
You took my beautiful Karl.

14:35.165 --> 14:37.960
- [Jessica] You're choking her!
- [EKG alarm beeping]

14:38.043 --> 14:41.380
Listen to me! She's not your enemy!

14:46.385 --> 14:48.095
You stole my family!

14:48.178 --> 14:49.722
Mom! Stop!

14:51.140 --> 14:53.058
Please don't take mine.

14:57.146 --> 14:59.231
Don't do this to me again.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.737
Please.

15:09.992 --> 15:10.993
[sighs]

15:14.079 --> 15:15.079
Jessie?

15:18.042 --> 15:19.126
Oh, my God.

15:23.339 --> 15:24.757
I came back.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.638
[chuckles]

15:31.221 --> 15:32.306
I came back.

15:33.849 --> 15:35.768
[laughs]

15:35.851 --> 15:38.062
On the floor! Hands behind your head.

15:38.145 --> 15:40.314
On the floor now! We will shoot.

15:40.397 --> 15:42.608
Back off! She's gonna surrender.

15:44.151 --> 15:46.820
- Stay back, Jones. Cuff her.
- Get away from her.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.489
[Sunday] Let me see your hands. Slowly.

15:49.573 --> 15:50.824
[exclaims]

15:52.952 --> 15:56.080
Take the shot. Do it, Costa.

15:59.208 --> 16:00.668
Let her go.

16:00.751 --> 16:03.212
- They'll kill me.
- I won't let them.

16:05.339 --> 16:06.465
Take the shot.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.050
[sighs]

16:14.932 --> 16:16.475
[inaudible]

16:42.292 --> 16:45.045
- Costa...
- Don't you goddamn move.

17:01.395 --> 17:03.731
[Hogarth] Do you remember
who sold it to you?

17:03.814 --> 17:06.013
A lot of people come through here.
Faces blend together.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.443
The bag came in yesterday

17:07.526 --> 17:10.237
along with thousands of dollars' worth
of my belongings.

17:10.319 --> 17:12.990
I'm sure the sellers made an impression.

17:13.073 --> 17:14.907
I can't help you.
Do you want the bag or not?

17:16.117 --> 17:21.999
$20,000 for the bag and whatever you know
about the people who brought it to you.

17:22.082 --> 17:23.000
A check, right.

17:23.083 --> 17:25.443
So you can cancel it two seconds
after you walk out of here?

17:26.462 --> 17:29.048
You could tip off your supplier
just as fast.

17:30.215 --> 17:33.052
I need to know that this transaction
will stay between us

17:33.135 --> 17:37.639
and I'm willing to pay for that assurance.
$30,000. Best and final.

17:38.348 --> 17:40.976
I start ratting out clients,
I stop getting clients.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.980
Want to protect your clients,
that's commendable.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.731
But in my experience,
even loyalty has a price.

17:45.814 --> 17:46.648
What's your deal?

17:46.732 --> 17:49.234
You obviously have money to burn.
This is just stuff.

17:49.318 --> 17:50.319
True.

17:50.861 --> 17:54.156
They didn't steal anything
that I can't replace.

17:55.032 --> 17:59.787
Except for my time and I don't know
how much more of that I have left.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.042
- Your watch.
- Excuse me?

18:05.125 --> 18:08.212
The Cartier.
Tank Française, if I'm not mistaken.

18:08.295 --> 18:10.297
It's worth everything in your shop.

18:10.380 --> 18:12.091
Or it's the price of my loyalty.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.438
"All My Love, W."

18:28.774 --> 18:29.775
My wife.

18:29.858 --> 18:33.946
Damn. Shane must've pulled
a real number on you.

18:34.029 --> 18:37.157
I'll take the bag, the espresso machine,
those earrings,

18:37.241 --> 18:39.118
and anything else that they sold you.

18:39.910 --> 18:42.621
And all the information
that you have on Shane.

18:42.704 --> 18:46.750
He was in here yesterday
bragging about conning some fancy lawyer.

18:48.877 --> 18:51.797
You're not the first,
if it's any consolation.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.132
I need an address.

18:58.554 --> 19:00.764
No. You're not going anywhere near her.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.015
What happened to "family"?

19:02.099 --> 19:05.102
The police told me all about your mother.

19:05.185 --> 19:08.480
You got my baby mixed up in all this?
You did this to her.

19:08.564 --> 19:10.858
It wasn't me
who had to get in front of those cameras

19:10.941 --> 19:12.860
and tell the whole world where Trish was.

19:12.943 --> 19:15.779
I didn't know the danger
that you had put her in.

19:15.863 --> 19:19.074
I was trying to protect Patsy.
Her brand is her legacy.

19:20.868 --> 19:25.038
You can't stop selling your daughter,
even if it kills her.

19:25.122 --> 19:29.793
[sighs] I finally understand you.
Like mother, like daughter.

19:30.627 --> 19:31.879
She must be so proud

19:31.962 --> 19:35.257
of the heartless monster
that you grew up to be.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.176
My mother is brain-damaged.

19:38.051 --> 19:39.178
What's your excuse?

19:40.220 --> 19:44.349
Mrs. Walker,
I need to have a word with Miss Jones.

19:44.933 --> 19:47.853
Yeah. What new disaster has she caused?

19:47.936 --> 19:49.229
You've been through a lot.

19:49.313 --> 19:51.833
We made the call rooms available
if you'd like to get some rest.

19:51.899 --> 19:55.903
Thank you. I just need something strong
for a splitting headache.

19:56.778 --> 19:58.989
And she is a menace.

20:05.621 --> 20:07.122
I'm gonna go see Trish.

20:08.332 --> 20:09.416
Let her through.

20:12.961 --> 20:15.521
I need you to go to the station
and give us a detailed statement.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.267
What are you talking about?
This isn't over.

20:17.299 --> 20:20.260
- It is for you. We'll take it from here.
- Like hell you will.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.970
You can either go with a police escort

20:22.054 --> 20:24.431
or make me use valuable manpower
to force you.

20:24.514 --> 20:27.768
Out of respect for my partner,
I'm asking you to make it easy.

20:27.851 --> 20:31.647
My mother is wounded.
That's not gonna slow her down.

20:31.730 --> 20:33.290
You know how she survived
that accident?

20:33.357 --> 20:34.997
Know how she survived
all those surgeries?

20:35.067 --> 20:39.780
That is sheer stubborn determination.
I am the only one who can handle her.

20:39.863 --> 20:41.615
Like you handled her
when she killed Sunday?

20:42.616 --> 20:44.201
Ruth Sunday was a damn good cop.

20:44.284 --> 20:47.913
We had our differences, but she'd still
be alive if I didn't trust you.

20:48.997 --> 20:52.167
It's over. Just get out of the way,
let us do our job.

20:54.211 --> 20:55.462
If they find her, they'll...

20:57.506 --> 20:59.216
they'll shoot to kill, won't they?

20:59.299 --> 21:02.135
You're damn right they will.
She took out one of our own.

21:03.136 --> 21:05.305
You don't need to see it.
You shouldn't have to.

21:05.389 --> 21:07.891
Just give us a statement and go home.

21:07.975 --> 21:09.101
Home?

21:09.184 --> 21:12.020
These guys are gonna stick on you
till this mess is over.

21:12.104 --> 21:13.647
In case she comes to you.

21:17.317 --> 21:18.902
I need to see Trish first.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.947
Hey, Jones. Don't try and be a hero.

21:23.532 --> 21:24.950
You know that's not you.

21:30.580 --> 21:33.625
I told her to stick
with her lifestyle format.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.774
You know what I always wished for?

21:59.860 --> 22:01.320
What I was always jealous of?

22:05.407 --> 22:06.992
You had your mother.

22:10.454 --> 22:12.039
As crazy and...

22:13.498 --> 22:16.710
[sighs] screwed up as Dorothy is,
at least she was here.

22:18.712 --> 22:21.465
And I had no goddamn clue
what I was even wishing for.

22:26.762 --> 22:28.513
And now I don't know what to do.

22:33.602 --> 22:34.770
[Trish] Asshole.

22:41.735 --> 22:42.736
Here.

22:47.949 --> 22:49.367
You asshole.

22:51.203 --> 22:52.579
The surgery.

22:54.289 --> 22:55.874
You stopped it.

22:55.957 --> 22:57.250
You're the asshole.

22:58.585 --> 23:01.004
- Where am I?
- The morgue.

23:02.172 --> 23:03.090
Am I dead?

23:03.173 --> 23:06.093
No, but you should be
after that stupid shit you pulled.

23:06.176 --> 23:07.344
Why am I here?

23:07.427 --> 23:09.429
My mom broke out
and she tried to kill you.

23:09.513 --> 23:13.391
So... the cops are stashing you
here in case she comes back.

23:14.768 --> 23:17.104
- Dr. Karl?
- He's gone.

23:17.187 --> 23:20.023
He's gone? As in?

23:20.107 --> 23:21.107
He's dead.

23:21.775 --> 23:23.944
[sighing]

23:25.529 --> 23:27.405
My one chance.

23:30.242 --> 23:32.536
Why couldn't you just let me have it?

23:32.619 --> 23:35.205
Because if that insane surgery
hadn't killed you,

23:35.288 --> 23:37.332
you could've ended up like my mom.

23:37.415 --> 23:39.584
Or I could've ended up like you.

23:39.668 --> 23:41.169
Why would you want that?

23:42.462 --> 23:45.799
There is a reason
that my biggest expense is booze.

23:45.882 --> 23:46.882
You're right.

23:48.260 --> 23:50.303
You don't deserve powers.

23:51.138 --> 23:52.764
All you do is piss them away

23:52.848 --> 23:55.600
when you could be out there
helping people.

23:55.684 --> 23:56.685
You know what?

23:56.768 --> 24:02.816
I am tired of being the focus
of your ridiculous insecurity.

24:02.899 --> 24:05.068
I didn't ask for any of this.

24:05.152 --> 24:08.530
Not these powers
and not your goddamn judgment.

24:08.613 --> 24:10.031
You're a coward.

24:10.115 --> 24:11.116
What?

24:12.993 --> 24:17.247
All I do is try and save your ass.

24:17.330 --> 24:18.874
I don't wanna be saved.

24:18.957 --> 24:22.669
And all you do is raise your expectations

24:22.752 --> 24:26.339
and make sure that I feel worthless.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.262
[sniffling]

24:37.017 --> 24:39.186
- [cell phone vibrating]
- [sighing]

24:44.941 --> 24:45.984
Who is this?

24:46.693 --> 24:50.280
I'm sorry about Trish...

24:51.448 --> 24:52.574
and that detective.

24:53.116 --> 24:55.160
Sorry isn't going to cut it.

24:55.243 --> 24:58.288
You tried to kill
the most important person in my life.

24:58.371 --> 25:01.958
My best friend. My sister.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.627
I was confused. I'm not anymore.

25:04.252 --> 25:05.378
[Jessica] Where are you?

25:06.254 --> 25:07.714
I need to see you.

25:07.797 --> 25:08.965
You have to be stopped.

25:09.049 --> 25:11.218
Just meet me somewhere.

25:12.219 --> 25:14.471
Just no cops. Just you and me.

25:14.554 --> 25:16.514
Where am I supposed to meet you?

25:16.598 --> 25:17.724
My apartment.

25:22.562 --> 25:23.647
Trish's apartment.

25:25.857 --> 25:26.857
No cops.

25:27.275 --> 25:29.027
Yeah, I heard you the first time.

25:32.447 --> 25:35.033
I can't let you hurt anyone else.

25:35.116 --> 25:36.743
I don't want that either.

25:45.794 --> 25:47.087
I don't know what to do.

25:48.755 --> 25:51.132
What's the right move here?
'Cause I don't know.

25:51.216 --> 25:53.385
There's only one thing you can do.

25:54.469 --> 25:55.637
You gotta put her down.

25:57.347 --> 26:00.600
You're the only one
powerful enough to do it.

26:00.684 --> 26:02.894
If Karl had finished what he started...

26:02.978 --> 26:04.312
You aren't serious.

26:04.396 --> 26:07.107
If I was powered, I wouldn't hesitate.

26:07.190 --> 26:10.485
Bullshit. How many times
have you forgiven Dorothy?

26:10.568 --> 26:13.154
Dorothy is not a mass murderer.

26:13.238 --> 26:14.531
But that's not who my mom is.

26:16.199 --> 26:17.492
Jess, if you don't do it,

26:17.575 --> 26:20.328
how many other people
are gonna die trying?

26:22.414 --> 26:26.042
You'll find Simpson's gear
in my bedroom closet.

26:28.920 --> 26:29.921
Use it.

26:37.721 --> 26:38.722
[exhales heavily]

26:54.571 --> 26:57.240
You should be careful
leaving your purse out like that.

26:57.324 --> 27:02.037
Some bad elements around here.
Anything not nailed down is fair game.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.371
That Porsche, for instance?

27:03.997 --> 27:06.458
Hey, you drive a Porsche,
you can afford another Porsche.

27:06.541 --> 27:09.419
Careful, Turk, or you're gonna end up
needing my skill set again.

27:09.502 --> 27:12.756
Except it's you
who needs my skill set right now.

27:12.839 --> 27:13.882
You have what I asked for?

27:14.674 --> 27:15.967
I don't disappoint.

27:18.803 --> 27:20.930
Plus, a side of curly fries.

27:22.015 --> 27:23.183
Is it for you?

27:25.810 --> 27:27.145
Probably best I don't know.

27:27.979 --> 27:29.230
Wise assessment.

27:29.314 --> 27:31.566
Never took you for the type
to get her hands dirty.

27:31.649 --> 27:34.444
Well, if it's untraceable,
my hands are immaculate.

27:34.527 --> 27:36.363
Scrubbing 'em clean is what I do.

27:37.364 --> 27:39.532
You want to trade again or you want cash?

27:39.616 --> 27:42.702
Trade. Have a feeling you might be right.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.121
I'm gonna be needing you again someday.

28:16.486 --> 28:17.654
[sighs]

28:21.658 --> 28:24.119
I gotta pee. I don't need protection.

28:28.998 --> 28:30.959
I'm coming with you willingly.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.042
We have our orders.

28:33.962 --> 28:37.549
There's a little old lady in here.
Do you wanna give her a heart attack?

28:38.717 --> 28:39.717
Appreciate it.

28:48.017 --> 28:49.477
[hand dryer blowing]

29:05.702 --> 29:06.703
[groans]

29:12.625 --> 29:13.625
Shit.

29:17.380 --> 29:20.133
[Vernon] I thought Mrs. Rezak
wasn't being released until tomorrow?

29:20.216 --> 29:22.135
[Maury] You gotta get the bodies out

29:22.218 --> 29:25.430
to make room for whatever the heck
they're doing in my morgue.

29:26.055 --> 29:29.934
- Things are gonna be backed up for days.
- Yeah.

29:50.205 --> 29:52.373
[Maury] You know what happened here,
don't you?

29:52.916 --> 29:56.461
A celebrity got attacked by a crazy fan.

29:57.420 --> 30:01.758
That's why I went to work in a morgue.
To get away from all this noise.

30:01.841 --> 30:04.427
Yeah. Dark times, but good for business.

30:04.594 --> 30:07.013
Yeah. All right.

30:07.972 --> 30:09.265
[both straining]

30:35.625 --> 30:36.793
[song playing over radio]

30:42.257 --> 30:44.008
What the hell?

30:45.009 --> 30:47.095
Jesus Christ. Let's go.

30:47.178 --> 30:48.179
Who are you?

30:48.263 --> 30:50.682
Drive. Keep it cool, and nobody gets hurt.

30:51.599 --> 30:52.684
I said drive.

30:56.396 --> 30:57.397
I said drive.

31:00.233 --> 31:01.985
You should have more respect for the dead.

31:02.735 --> 31:03.945
33rd and Columbus.

31:33.433 --> 31:34.434
You didn't call the cops?

31:35.143 --> 31:36.561
[mutters]

31:38.688 --> 31:40.982
- Then what do you want?
- Just to talk.

31:42.233 --> 31:45.445
I thought all day
about what I wanted to say to you,

31:45.528 --> 31:46.738
what I wanted to do.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.074
Now, I just want to know why.

31:50.158 --> 31:52.160
I didn't mean for it to get this far.

31:54.203 --> 31:56.748
The whole healer thing was Shane's idea.

31:57.832 --> 32:00.269
It started as just a way to get him out.
I was desperate. I...

32:00.293 --> 32:01.294
Pathetic.

32:03.671 --> 32:05.173
- Love.
- [scoffs]

32:06.633 --> 32:08.801
Is that what love looks like to you?

32:08.885 --> 32:10.845
I can't help the way I feel about him.

32:12.931 --> 32:14.891
He feels the same way about me.

32:16.851 --> 32:18.937
[Hogarth] Then he fooled both of us.

32:20.939 --> 32:25.526
No, it's... it's real.

32:26.486 --> 32:29.280
- But so is how I feel for you.
- Don't.

32:31.157 --> 32:35.703
My trust is hard to win,
and I gave it to you.

32:36.329 --> 32:37.997
And you crushed me.

32:39.457 --> 32:42.210
For the record,
I tried to leave that night

32:42.293 --> 32:44.879
and then you came home
with frigging champagne.

32:44.963 --> 32:46.339
Oh, don't blame the champagne.

32:46.422 --> 32:47.924
Why did you go to bed with me?

32:49.092 --> 32:53.096
Just to sell it or to get off
before you went back to Shane?

32:53.179 --> 32:54.514
[laughs]

32:58.017 --> 33:00.979
- Wasn't part of the plan.
- Hmm.

33:02.105 --> 33:04.357
Someone like you, interested in me.

33:07.318 --> 33:12.323
But the way you looked at me, it felt...

33:15.034 --> 33:16.744
He doesn't deserve you, Inez.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.830
Not after what he's been doing
behind your back.

33:20.790 --> 33:23.960
I reached out to a friend of mine
in the Department of Corrections.

33:24.043 --> 33:28.798
He, uh, gave me copies of letters
that Shane wrote from prison.

33:28.881 --> 33:31.634
- Shane didn't write letters.
- Not to you.

33:31.718 --> 33:33.970
They were sending him gifts. Money mostly.

33:35.304 --> 33:38.766
In exchange for flattery, promises...

33:38.850 --> 33:44.022
No. He must've been scamming them
for commissary cash.

33:44.105 --> 33:46.065
He was getting
more than candy money, Inez.

33:47.567 --> 33:50.987
He's got thousands of dollars
stashed somewhere...

33:51.070 --> 33:53.132
- He wouldn't keep that from me.
- Of course he would.

33:53.156 --> 33:55.199
That's who he is. He's a con artist.

33:55.283 --> 33:56.200
You were homeless,

33:56.284 --> 33:59.078
while he was using women
to build his nest egg.

34:00.329 --> 34:02.331
No. It's not like that.

34:04.125 --> 34:05.126
He needs me.

34:05.877 --> 34:10.922
[Hogarth] He needs someone damaged
and desperate enough to manipulate.

34:11.007 --> 34:14.135
After all the shit you've been through
at IGH and on the street...

34:14.217 --> 34:17.221
He used it to whore you out to me.

34:22.435 --> 34:24.062
I sent him money, too.

34:25.980 --> 34:28.900
Whatever I got off the streets,
I always sent him a little.

34:29.984 --> 34:33.112
How much longer do you think that
he's going to live like this with you?

34:34.197 --> 34:39.077
He's gonna skip out on you
and any other woman he's played

34:39.786 --> 34:41.120
as quick as he can.

34:46.125 --> 34:47.668
I won't let him.

34:47.752 --> 34:49.670
He's gonna screw you over, Inez.

34:51.547 --> 34:53.299
Like he did me, maybe even worse.

34:55.842 --> 34:57.678
Even after everything, I, uh...

35:00.723 --> 35:02.558
I don't want that to happen to you.

35:06.896 --> 35:08.356
Asshole's gonna pay.

35:08.439 --> 35:09.524
Hey, wait, wait.

35:11.609 --> 35:14.362
You can't just walk in there like this.

35:18.699 --> 35:19.784
He's dangerous.

35:22.036 --> 35:23.454
He's been using you.

35:25.039 --> 35:27.125
You need to protect yourself, please.

35:48.104 --> 35:49.105
[Jessica] Pull over.

35:51.858 --> 35:53.234
What are you doing?

35:54.318 --> 35:58.573
"Vernon Muñoz. Muñoz &amp; Sons Mortuary.
49 Third Avenue."

35:58.656 --> 36:00.416
You go to the cops,
I know where to find you.

36:00.491 --> 36:02.618
I want no part in this craziness.

36:02.702 --> 36:06.414
Well, I didn't want to ride in a body bag
with Mrs. Rezak, but shit happens.

36:06.497 --> 36:08.583
I'm guessing you'll get to ride
in a bag very soon.

36:51.167 --> 36:54.545
[indistinct arguing]

36:55.087 --> 36:56.589
[arguing continues]

37:15.483 --> 37:16.901
[sighs]

37:26.285 --> 37:27.285
[gunshot]

37:30.873 --> 37:32.500
[Inez crying]

37:57.108 --> 37:58.234
[dialing]

38:02.071 --> 38:03.711
[dispatcher] 911. What is your emergency?

38:03.739 --> 38:05.533
I'd like to report a shooting.

38:06.909 --> 38:11.789
We need a deluxe suite with a decent view,
preferably overlooking the river.

38:12.748 --> 38:15.751
The name is Trish Walker, as in Patsy.

38:17.420 --> 38:20.047
Well, when something opens up,
please give me a call.

38:21.882 --> 38:25.136
I am going to get you
into a better hospital if it kills me.

38:25.720 --> 38:30.349
I cannot believe
they put you down in this graveyard.

38:33.311 --> 38:34.311
[sighs]

38:37.315 --> 38:39.233
Do you need another pillow?

38:42.320 --> 38:43.779
Where are those damn nurses?

38:43.863 --> 38:46.741
Mom, it's okay.

38:47.575 --> 38:49.869
- It doesn't matter.
- Well, of course it does, honey.

38:49.952 --> 38:53.331
I'm not gonna let them get away
with giving you less than you deserve.

38:54.707 --> 38:56.250
Something's wrong.

38:58.836 --> 39:02.882
Everything's gonna be fine.
You're gonna get better soon.

39:03.549 --> 39:05.217
I think I'm dying.

39:07.094 --> 39:11.140
We'll get you a better team.
It's all gonna work out.

39:11.223 --> 39:16.020
Your fans, you've got so many fans.
They're rooting for you.

39:17.146 --> 39:18.230
Mom...

39:19.398 --> 39:22.193
will you hold my hand?

39:25.529 --> 39:27.073
I'm scared.

39:28.324 --> 39:31.410
I'm here. I'm here, baby.

39:32.578 --> 39:34.038
Your mommy's here.

39:34.914 --> 39:36.999
And I'm so proud of you.

39:37.917 --> 39:41.921
You're everything I wanted to be
and so much more.

39:50.638 --> 39:53.974
Pats? Patsy?

39:57.603 --> 39:59.980
Trish? Trish!

40:00.064 --> 40:01.774
- [gasping]
- [EKG beeping rapidly]

40:01.857 --> 40:04.568
Oh, my God! Help!

40:04.652 --> 40:06.404
Oh, my God! What's happening?

40:06.570 --> 40:07.947
[wheezing]

40:08.030 --> 40:09.240
Mrs. Walker, stand back.

40:12.410 --> 40:13.786
I need some help in here!

40:42.440 --> 40:43.441
Jessica?

40:49.530 --> 40:50.531
Jessica?

40:59.290 --> 41:00.291
Jessica?

41:09.925 --> 41:11.552
- [gun cocks]
- [gasps]

41:14.930 --> 41:15.931
Don't move.

41:21.896 --> 41:23.856
Guns don't seem like your style.

41:27.443 --> 41:30.321
It's gotta be easier
than using my bare hands.

41:30.404 --> 41:31.572
Less personal.

41:33.115 --> 41:36.076
I suppose if you
have to kill your own mother,

41:36.160 --> 41:38.400
you might not wanna look her
in the eyes while you do it.

41:38.454 --> 41:41.248
Turn around. Slowly.

41:49.215 --> 41:50.382
Losing Karl...

41:51.467 --> 41:54.512
it just pushed me over the edge.
I'm sorry.

41:56.388 --> 42:00.226
I know you think this is the only option,
but it's not.

42:02.394 --> 42:03.395
You brought me back.

42:03.479 --> 42:07.024
Within an inch of killing my best friend.

42:07.107 --> 42:09.068
But an inch is miles for me.

42:10.986 --> 42:12.488
You did something Karl never could.

42:12.571 --> 42:13.864
I don't care anymore.

42:13.948 --> 42:16.116
He tried to develop techniques
to reach me...

42:16.200 --> 42:19.453
- I don't care.
- [breathes heavily]

42:19.537 --> 42:22.248
They never worked when I was deep in it.

42:22.331 --> 42:26.961
- But you... [sighs] You broke through.
- Fine. I broke through once.

42:27.044 --> 42:29.004
Twice. So it's viable.

42:30.506 --> 42:31.924
Because it's you.

42:33.676 --> 42:36.595
- We could hone this.
- There is no "we."

42:38.389 --> 42:40.182
- But there could be.
- No.

42:40.266 --> 42:41.809
You killed that possibility.

42:43.477 --> 42:44.895
Along with a cop.

42:45.646 --> 42:49.149
I had no choice.
They were never gonna let me live.

42:49.233 --> 42:51.860
There is always a choice.

42:51.944 --> 42:55.406
Your brain is just too goddamn broken
to ever make the right one.

42:55.489 --> 42:56.490
It's over.

42:57.908 --> 42:59.201
Go to The Raft...

43:01.412 --> 43:03.080
or one of us dies tonight.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.293
I will do it.

43:10.045 --> 43:13.424
Don't make me. Please.

43:15.634 --> 43:18.929
Without you,
I have nothing to live for anyway.

43:21.807 --> 43:24.810
So, go ahead. Pull the trigger.

43:24.893 --> 43:28.272
Honestly, I'd rather it was you.

43:43.662 --> 43:46.206
It's okay. It's okay.

43:47.374 --> 43:48.500
You'll be okay.

43:54.340 --> 43:56.425
[Jessica] What happens to our dreams

43:57.676 --> 44:01.513
when we realize
they're never going to come true?

44:03.182 --> 44:05.184
They turn into nightmares.
