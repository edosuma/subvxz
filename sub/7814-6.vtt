I'm Jackie!

Who the heck is that?

01:39.458 --> 01:40.458
[screaming]

01:40.458 --> 01:41.709
I'm Jackie Wackerman.

01:41.709 --> 01:43.542
My mom's job got
transferred to Mellowbrook,

01:43.542 --> 01:45.500
which I thought
was gonna be totally lame,
but then I saw you,

01:45.500 --> 01:47.792
and I figure you must be, like,
a really famous daredevil!

01:47.792 --> 01:49.750
Can I have your autograph?

01:49.750 --> 01:51.792
Uh, where do I sign?

01:52.875 --> 01:54.333
[Jackie gasping]

01:55.750 --> 01:57.750
And I was wondering

01:57.750 --> 01:59.834
if I could just
touch your helmet.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.667
I will never wash
this finger again.

02:07.667 --> 02:10.667
[laughing]
You're awesome!

02:10.667 --> 02:12.083
I am so your biggest fan
in the world now,

02:12.083 --> 02:13.959
and I'm totally starting
your fan club.

02:13.959 --> 02:15.709
We'll have T-shirts
and membership cards
and buttons--

02:15.709 --> 02:17.250
Sorry, miss.
This is one daredevil

02:17.250 --> 02:19.000
who is not in it
for the fame.

02:19.000 --> 02:21.917
But every great American hero
has a fan club.

02:21.917 --> 02:24.291
Billy Stumps, Rock Callahan,
Boom McCondor.

02:24.291 --> 02:25.875
I'm in all their clubs.

02:25.875 --> 02:28.291
Hey, you got wax
in your ears? I said--

02:28.291 --> 02:30.333
Well, if those guys
have fan clubs--

02:30.333 --> 02:33.625
I'll get started
right away.

02:33.625 --> 02:37.333
[laughing]
Um, what's your name again?

02:37.333 --> 02:38.792
The name's Kick.

02:38.792 --> 02:40.542
Kick Buttowski.

02:40.542 --> 02:42.750
Kick Buttowski Fan Club!

02:42.750 --> 02:44.250
Touch.
[screams]

02:44.250 --> 02:47.291
Did you hear that, Gunther?
I've got a biggest fan.

02:50.834 --> 02:53.542
You can do it, Kick!
Do it.

02:53.542 --> 02:55.875
Good-bye,
my chocolate friends.

03:02.875 --> 03:04.041
You're done, son.

03:06.041 --> 03:08.542
Perfect.
Let's do this.

03:11.166 --> 03:12.625
Holla!

03:14.041 --> 03:15.667
[camera shutter clicking]

03:16.667 --> 03:18.000
You're killing this one.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.125
What? What?

03:23.542 --> 03:25.542
That was awesome!

03:27.000 --> 03:28.834
And delicious.
[laughing]
[laughing]

03:28.834 --> 03:30.875
Hey, buddy,
what was my time?

03:30.875 --> 03:34.083
Whoo-hoo!
8.06 seconds.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.041
That's a new record.

03:36.041 --> 03:38.709
Well, let's try it again
and see if we can--
No time for that.

03:38.709 --> 03:41.000
Gotta show you
your new Web page.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.625
A Web page?
Well, maybe later.
Come on!

03:43.625 --> 03:45.417
That's okay.

03:45.417 --> 03:47.083
I'll just, uh,

03:47.083 --> 03:49.041
get down by myself.

03:50.041 --> 03:51.917
[screeching]

04:07.875 --> 04:09.959
Hey, Kick,
I saved you a seat,

04:09.959 --> 04:11.166
and I brought you
our favorite--

04:11.166 --> 04:15.083
Chewy Bran Chunks
with a Chia Chug chaser.

04:15.083 --> 04:17.208
Part of
a nutritious breakfast.

04:17.208 --> 04:18.834
Slide it on over, pal.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.291
[Jackie]
No!

04:20.291 --> 04:21.917
As president
of your fan club,

04:21.917 --> 04:24.125
I present you

04:24.125 --> 04:25.083
with these!

04:25.083 --> 04:26.583
Hey, sweet.

04:26.583 --> 04:28.917
I think it really captures
your inner awesome.

04:28.917 --> 04:32.000
I never knew how great
it was to have fans.

04:32.000 --> 04:35.333
"I never knew how great
it was to have fans."

04:39.291 --> 04:40.709
Kick, over here!

04:40.709 --> 04:42.917
Hey, Kick,
I got your favorite lunch--

04:42.917 --> 04:45.959
a sardine peanut butter
and marshmallow sandwich,
just like you like it.

04:45.959 --> 04:47.834
You can sit next to me
if you want.

04:47.834 --> 04:49.917
I don't need to eat
because watching you eat
is enough for me.

04:49.917 --> 04:51.542
[sighing]

04:56.959 --> 04:58.959
[Jackie]
That's $5. Thank you.

04:58.959 --> 05:02.125
Now, as full-fledged members
of the Kick Buttowski Fan Club,

05:02.125 --> 05:05.417
you'll be entitled to discounts
on many premium souvenirs,

05:05.417 --> 05:07.667
such as the autographed
jumbo bandage pack

05:07.667 --> 05:10.000
containing actual bandages
worn by Kick

05:10.000 --> 05:12.125
after his
death-defying stunts.

05:12.125 --> 05:14.458
I'll take one.
How much for
the smelly sock?

05:14.458 --> 05:17.500
Psst! Kick, I did
a little reconnaissance.

05:17.500 --> 05:21.041
You're not gonna believe
what I reconnoitered.

05:21.041 --> 05:22.625
Aw, come on, Gunther.

05:22.625 --> 05:24.750
I'm serious.
Just look at me.

05:24.750 --> 05:25.875
Serious?

05:25.875 --> 05:28.083
So serious.

05:28.083 --> 05:29.709
Okay, fine.
Come on.

05:29.709 --> 05:32.417
But we gotta
go stealth mode.

05:32.417 --> 05:34.125
Attention, neighbors.

05:34.125 --> 05:38.375
Do you realize we live next to
a world-famous stuntman?

05:40.208 --> 05:41.667
[Kick]
And exactly why

05:41.667 --> 05:43.458
are we climbing
into Jackie's bedroom?

05:43.458 --> 05:44.709
You'll see.

05:47.542 --> 05:49.792
Behold the wacky.

05:57.583 --> 05:59.375
[Kick]
I thought I lost those.

05:59.375 --> 06:01.542
Starting to get
the picture yet?

06:01.542 --> 06:04.083
Yeah, I am.
This room--

06:04.083 --> 06:05.542
it's so...

06:05.542 --> 06:07.166
fantastic!

06:07.166 --> 06:10.208
Oh, for the love of--
Ahh!

06:10.208 --> 06:12.834
Oh, yeah?
Well, check this out.

06:12.834 --> 06:15.125
<i>I'm Kick Buttowski.</i>
<i>I love you, Jackie.</i>

06:15.125 --> 06:16.500
[laughing]

06:16.500 --> 06:18.792
She's my
number 1 fan for sure.

06:18.792 --> 06:21.041
<i>[squeaks] </i>
Ooh, cupcakes!
Gimme.

06:21.041 --> 06:24.166
When are you gonna realize
that Jackie is wacky?

06:24.166 --> 06:26.083
Why is she so wacky?

06:26.083 --> 06:28.375
Because she started
a fan club for me?

06:28.375 --> 06:30.458
Because she rifles
through my trash?

06:30.458 --> 06:32.834
Because she makes
great cupcakes?

06:32.834 --> 06:35.834
Yeah. Don't you see?
She's obsessed with you.

06:35.834 --> 06:39.000
You better get rid of your fan
before it's too late.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.208
You know,
I'm beginning to wonder
if you're a fan.

06:43.000 --> 06:45.125
You're right, Kick.
I'm not your fan.

06:45.125 --> 06:47.875
[sniffles]
I'm your friend.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.208
Buddy, come on.

06:53.792 --> 06:56.792
Aw, see? I knew
you'd come around.

07:00.750 --> 07:02.709
[bell rings]

07:04.792 --> 07:06.542
Dude, I got the principal

07:06.542 --> 07:08.709
to let me move into
the locker next to yours.

07:08.709 --> 07:10.792
Then I knocked out
the wall in between

07:10.792 --> 07:12.583
so we can be roomies.
[bell dings]

07:12.583 --> 07:16.208
And look. I made cookies.
Only they're Kickies.

07:16.208 --> 07:18.291
Come on.
There's milk in the fridge.

07:20.750 --> 07:24.125
Hi, Kick.
[chuckles]

07:24.125 --> 07:27.000
[whirring]

07:28.917 --> 07:30.083
Ta-da!

07:30.083 --> 07:32.000
Oopsie.
[chuckling]

07:36.166 --> 07:37.750
[toilet flushes]

07:38.792 --> 07:39.875
[horn blares]

07:39.875 --> 07:41.959
Nice work, dude.

07:41.959 --> 07:43.125
That's a new record.

07:43.125 --> 07:45.166
Let me wash
your hands for you.

07:48.417 --> 07:51.250
Aw, finally, peace.

07:51.250 --> 07:53.083
And opportunity.
[growling]

07:54.834 --> 07:57.417
[barking]

07:59.542 --> 08:00.834
Say cheese!

08:04.041 --> 08:06.208
[barking]

08:10.417 --> 08:12.750
[panting]
Maybe Gunther's right.

08:12.750 --> 08:15.041
Maybe Jackie is wacky.

08:15.041 --> 08:18.041
I'm not wacky, kid.
I'm just your biggest fan.

08:18.041 --> 08:21.333
I'll never leave you.
I love you.

08:21.333 --> 08:23.125
[horn honking]

08:24.125 --> 08:26.000
Hi, Kick.

08:26.000 --> 08:28.291
We're your biggest fan.

08:31.792 --> 08:34.583
Oh, sorry, Mr. Vickle.
I didn't see you.

08:34.583 --> 08:36.166
Oh, no problem, Kick.

08:36.166 --> 08:38.333
I'm your number 1 fan!

08:38.333 --> 08:40.291
Nooo!

08:40.291 --> 08:41.333
Whew!

08:41.333 --> 08:43.959
[chuckles]
It was just a dream.

08:43.959 --> 08:46.375
Do you know you purr
when you sleep?

08:46.375 --> 08:48.166
What are you doing
in my bed?

08:48.166 --> 08:49.792
Pillow fight!

08:49.792 --> 08:51.792
[laughing]

08:52.792 --> 08:54.959
Fight back.
It's funny.

08:54.959 --> 08:56.083
[doorbell rings]

08:57.333 --> 08:59.166
A present? Yay!

08:59.166 --> 09:00.542
Oh.

09:00.542 --> 09:02.417
Gunther, you gotta help me.

09:02.417 --> 09:05.083
Why don't you ask
your fan for help?

09:05.083 --> 09:07.583
Gunther, wait.
She's following me everywhere.

09:07.583 --> 09:09.125
She's ruining my stunts.

09:09.125 --> 09:10.625
I can't even go...

09:10.625 --> 09:11.667
[quietly]
to the bathroom.

09:11.667 --> 09:13.417
It's awfully late
to go knocking

09:13.417 --> 09:15.709
on people's doors,
Clarence.

09:17.208 --> 09:20.208
Especially people
who aren't your friend.

09:20.208 --> 09:22.083
You were right
about Jackie.

09:22.083 --> 09:25.000
And you're what?

09:25.000 --> 09:26.417
Gunther, I'm sorry.

09:26.417 --> 09:29.041
Apology accepted.

09:29.041 --> 09:32.083
But what are we gonna do?
I've got just the idea.

09:32.083 --> 09:33.917
[bell rings]

09:36.083 --> 09:38.667
Hey, Kick, guess what.

09:38.667 --> 09:40.375
Hey, slow down, buddy.
[whistle blowing]

09:40.375 --> 09:42.250
You're walking
too fast.

09:42.250 --> 09:43.625
You know, Gunther,

09:43.625 --> 09:44.917
doing after-school
safety patrol

09:44.917 --> 09:46.959
is about the funnest thing
in the world.

09:46.959 --> 09:48.250
Oh, hi, Jackie.

09:48.250 --> 09:49.875
I heard a water main
broke downtown.

09:49.875 --> 09:52.417
The entire sewer system
is filled with rushing water,

09:52.417 --> 09:55.125
and I just happen to have
a surfboard at home.

09:55.125 --> 09:56.291
Really?

09:56.291 --> 09:58.291
[chuckles]
Uh, no, thanks.

09:58.291 --> 10:00.417
I'd rather stay right here
and brush up

10:00.417 --> 10:03.917
for my hall monitor exam.

10:03.917 --> 10:06.875
Study? Safety?
I thought you were a daredevil.

10:06.875 --> 10:09.458
[laughs]
Him? A daredevil?

10:09.458 --> 10:11.083
Ha! He's a scaredy-cat,

10:11.083 --> 10:12.834
a wimp, a teeny,
tiny, little--

10:12.834 --> 10:14.125
Ow!

10:14.125 --> 10:16.333
But you're a rebel!
A hero!

10:16.333 --> 10:19.250
Oh, that stuff.
I was just messing with you.

10:19.250 --> 10:21.250
I'm all about safety.
Come on.

10:21.250 --> 10:23.917
Why do you think I wear
this helmet all the time?
For stunts.

10:23.917 --> 10:26.000
That's what you love.
No.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.959
My true loves are safety,
prevention, and caution.

10:28.959 --> 10:31.125
I hope to be
a crossing guard someday.

10:31.125 --> 10:33.542
Ah. Isn't she beautiful?

10:33.542 --> 10:36.125
Watch out, Kick.
You almost stepped on a crack.

10:36.125 --> 10:37.917
Good call, buddy.
Oh.

10:37.917 --> 10:41.500
I see. I guess I was
mistaken about you.

10:43.291 --> 10:45.166
Remember, safety first.

10:45.166 --> 10:48.917
Look both ways when
you're crossing the street.

10:54.166 --> 10:56.375
Yes! I'm free!

10:56.375 --> 10:58.166
We did it!

10:58.166 --> 11:00.000
Come on, Gunther.

11:00.000 --> 11:03.375
Let's go surf
that busted water main.
[chomp]

11:03.375 --> 11:04.792
Okay, Oscar.
[growling]

11:04.792 --> 11:06.375
You can come, too.

11:07.625 --> 11:10.000
[laughing]

11:19.166 --> 11:21.000
[Kick]
Come on, Gunther.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.458
The gully only floods
once a year,

11:22.458 --> 11:24.375
and I want to
take advantage of it.

11:24.375 --> 11:26.792
Let's rock this thing.

11:30.083 --> 11:33.041
You're gonna need to go
faster than that.

11:33.041 --> 11:35.041
Okay. Okay.

11:35.041 --> 11:37.208
Here we go. Okay.

11:37.208 --> 11:39.125
We're trucking now.

11:39.125 --> 11:43.166
Come on, Gunther.
Row, row, row your boat!

11:44.834 --> 11:46.709
Now, that's more like it.

11:46.709 --> 11:50.041
Uh, I'll just keep up
the good work then.

12:00.583 --> 12:02.500
Did you see that?

12:02.500 --> 12:04.792
See that?
I lived that.

12:04.792 --> 12:06.709
What was that thing?

12:06.709 --> 12:09.417
I didn't think
she was real.
What are you talking about?

12:09.417 --> 12:13.166
I'm talking about
Pescado del Diablo.
[thunderclap]

12:13.166 --> 12:15.166
Pescado del Diablo?

12:15.166 --> 12:16.834
According to legend,

12:16.834 --> 12:19.083
she was thought
to be dead...
[toilet flushes]

12:19.083 --> 12:21.125
flushed out to sea.

12:21.125 --> 12:24.125
Free from the constraints
of her little glass bowl,

12:24.125 --> 12:26.000
she grew and grew

12:26.000 --> 12:30.125
until she reached the height
of two Battle Snax.

12:30.125 --> 12:32.000
And now, every year

12:32.000 --> 12:35.166
when the gully floods,
she returns

12:35.166 --> 12:38.083
to seek revenge on anyone

12:38.083 --> 12:41.125
who dares trespass
on her turf.

12:42.458 --> 12:44.458
We need to catch
that fish.

12:44.458 --> 12:46.083
I knew you
were gonna say that.

12:46.083 --> 12:47.333
We'll harness its power

12:47.333 --> 12:49.458
for the most extreme
wakeboarding ever!

12:49.458 --> 12:52.875
But I can't row fast enough
to catch Pescado del Diablo.

12:52.875 --> 12:54.166
I have weak arms.

12:54.166 --> 12:56.792
Well, first, we're gonna
need a bigger boat.

12:56.792 --> 12:58.041
[horn blaring]

13:01.959 --> 13:03.542
Well, that was unexpected.

13:03.542 --> 13:06.083
Ahoy there, mateys!

13:06.083 --> 13:08.750
What are you two doing in
the middle of the flooded gully?

13:11.041 --> 13:13.792
The legend says
that she's more fearsome

13:13.792 --> 13:16.583
than any shark,
bigger than any whale--

13:16.583 --> 13:19.125
Stop. You had me
at "the."

13:19.125 --> 13:21.375
I was going to sail
to Cape Cod,
but forming a posse

13:21.375 --> 13:24.125
to chase down a deadly,
man-eating sea creature

13:24.125 --> 13:25.792
is right up my alley.

13:25.792 --> 13:28.375
Okay. But be warned.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.375
We may not
make it back alive.

13:30.375 --> 13:32.375
Not make it back alive?

13:32.375 --> 13:35.125
You mean,
I could miss dinner?

13:35.125 --> 13:36.458
Pa-lease.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.750
Three men
alone on the open water.

13:38.750 --> 13:40.500
What could possibly
go wrong?

13:40.500 --> 13:42.875
[thunderclap]

13:47.000 --> 13:48.583
[thunderclap continues]

13:48.583 --> 13:51.208
[both yelling]

14:00.166 --> 14:02.041
The food!

14:02.041 --> 14:04.625
Help!
[grunting]

14:04.625 --> 14:07.375
Help! Help! Help!

14:07.375 --> 14:10.083
I've got it
under control. Go.
Right.

14:10.083 --> 14:11.291
[yelling]

14:12.709 --> 14:14.083
[rope creaking]

14:14.083 --> 14:16.625
Can't hold on!

14:19.458 --> 14:21.834
Gotcha.
Hang on, everyone.

14:35.291 --> 14:37.166
Gunther. Gunther!

14:37.166 --> 14:39.333
Wake up, Gunther.
[coughing]

14:39.333 --> 14:41.917
Am-- Am I dead?
Oh, Gunther,

14:41.917 --> 14:44.291
I'm sorry I brought you
into this crazy mess.

14:44.291 --> 14:46.458
What are we doing
out here, anyway?

14:46.458 --> 14:49.709
Maybe it was just me.
Maybe I just wanted it
to be real.

14:49.709 --> 14:52.750
I bet Pescado del Diablo
was just a figment

14:52.750 --> 14:54.208
of our imagination.

14:57.083 --> 14:59.875
[screams]
My leg!

14:59.875 --> 15:01.333
Whew.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.166
[screams]
My shoe!

15:03.166 --> 15:05.375
A shoe is
a small price to pay

15:05.375 --> 15:08.375
for the most extreme
wakeboarding ever!

15:08.375 --> 15:10.166
But I liked that shoe.

15:10.166 --> 15:12.542
I called him Lefty.

15:17.834 --> 15:19.875
She's even bigger
than they say.

15:19.875 --> 15:22.208
No. It must've been
something else.

15:22.208 --> 15:25.291
I'm a goldfish aficionado.
They don't get that big.

15:25.291 --> 15:29.000
Give anything enough time
and enough food, it'll grow.

15:29.000 --> 15:31.041
Remember that.

15:31.041 --> 15:32.875
Impossible.
[hits table]

15:32.875 --> 15:36.000
Then how do
you explain...this?

15:36.000 --> 15:39.208
Looks like fish teeth
tore these pants,
doesn't it?

15:39.208 --> 15:40.583
Goldfish teeth.

15:40.583 --> 15:43.375
Look at it! Look!

15:43.375 --> 15:46.458
Goldfish don't have teeth.

15:46.458 --> 15:48.959
Tell that to my leg!

15:48.959 --> 15:52.875
Goldfish don't have teeth.

15:52.875 --> 15:55.083
[both laughing]

15:55.083 --> 15:58.291
You're okay, old man.
You, too, kid.
You, too.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.125
[sonar beeping]

16:00.125 --> 16:02.208
She's here.

16:04.000 --> 16:05.959
[beeping intensifies]

16:05.959 --> 16:08.250
She's everywhere!

16:08.250 --> 16:10.792
I don't want to get eaten
by a giant goldfish!

16:10.792 --> 16:13.166
No one's getting eaten
by a giant goldfish.

16:13.166 --> 16:14.291
[rumbling]

16:22.500 --> 16:23.542
My chance.

16:31.333 --> 16:33.959
I got her.
You got her?

16:38.375 --> 16:40.333
No! She's got us!

16:40.333 --> 16:41.834
She's got us!

16:46.500 --> 16:47.834
[engine revving]

16:50.250 --> 16:52.625
I'm full throttle.
She's too strong.

16:52.625 --> 16:56.333
She's gonna take us down.
Cut the line! Cut the line!

16:56.333 --> 16:58.458
You heard him.
Cut the line!

16:58.458 --> 17:00.792
Not till I've had my ride.

17:02.709 --> 17:05.125
[rope creaking]

17:05.125 --> 17:06.417
Save yourself.

17:08.125 --> 17:10.917
No! I won't let you die!

17:10.917 --> 17:13.125
Who said anything
about dying?

17:14.291 --> 17:15.709
My board!

17:19.500 --> 17:22.500
[screams]
Kick! There!

17:22.500 --> 17:25.291
Two points off the starboard!
Go! Go! Go!

17:25.291 --> 17:27.291
Excellent. I was hoping
for a boat chase.

17:35.417 --> 17:37.959
[grunting]

17:37.959 --> 17:40.542
Now let's see
what this baby can do.

17:40.542 --> 17:42.375
Let's go!

17:51.959 --> 17:54.375
Hang on, Kick!
Whoo-hoo!

18:07.542 --> 18:09.458
[muffled yelling]

18:25.166 --> 18:26.667
[yelling]

18:31.291 --> 18:32.667
[Gunther]
Hang on, Kick!

18:32.667 --> 18:34.750
We'll circle around
to get you!

18:53.542 --> 18:57.041
Faster! Faster!
She's coming back for us!

18:57.041 --> 18:58.333
Hang on, boys.

19:14.417 --> 19:15.750
Nice driving.

19:15.750 --> 19:18.083
Never mess with a Navy man.

19:18.083 --> 19:20.875
Now that you got your ride,
can we just get out of here?

19:20.875 --> 19:22.792
I rocked my goal!

19:22.792 --> 19:24.792
So yes.
Good.

19:24.792 --> 19:26.208
Let's get outta here!

19:26.208 --> 19:28.458
Aye, aye, matey.

19:28.458 --> 19:29.625
[engine grinds]

19:29.625 --> 19:30.834
[stops]
Uh-oh.

19:32.917 --> 19:34.542
We're out of fuel.

19:34.542 --> 19:37.125
How cliché.

19:37.125 --> 19:39.041
[clanging softly]

19:40.125 --> 19:42.333
It sure is quiet.

19:42.333 --> 19:44.542
Too quiet.

19:44.542 --> 19:46.625
[clanging continues]

19:50.625 --> 19:53.041
Look who returned to rumble.

19:55.041 --> 19:57.500
Okay, let's rumble, fish.

19:57.500 --> 19:59.208
Brace yourselves!

20:03.709 --> 20:04.834
Kick!

20:06.166 --> 20:07.458
Kick?

20:14.875 --> 20:16.625
I got her!

20:16.625 --> 20:17.625
[roars]

20:31.458 --> 20:32.834
[growling]

20:36.083 --> 20:37.750
Stop, you fool!

20:37.750 --> 20:39.542
She'll eat you
where you stand!

20:39.542 --> 20:42.083
[roars]

20:42.083 --> 20:44.166
G-- Goldie?

20:50.041 --> 20:52.500
[crying]

20:55.125 --> 20:56.792
Good-bye, Goldie.

20:56.792 --> 20:58.417
I'll miss you.

20:58.417 --> 21:00.125
[toilet flushing]

21:05.667 --> 21:07.709
Oh, Goldie.

21:07.709 --> 21:10.083
It is you.

21:11.583 --> 21:13.625
So--

21:13.625 --> 21:15.542
[cries]
So sweet.

21:15.542 --> 21:18.959
Goldie, we're gonna
need a lift.

21:21.291 --> 21:23.709
Oh, yeah! Whoo-hoo!

21:29.250 --> 21:30.583
[Gunther]
Lefty!

21:31.542 --> 21:34.542
