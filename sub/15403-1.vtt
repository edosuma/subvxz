02:37.010 --> 02:40.250
<i>The window that once glowed with light</i>

02:40.300 --> 02:44.370
<i>is now darkened.</i>

02:45.450 --> 02:48.790
<i>A sign that my beloved</i>

02:48.840 --> 02:53.260
<i>is unwell.</i>

02:55.090 --> 02:58.250
<i>Her sister comes to the window</i>

02:58.400 --> 03:02.000
<i>and tells me:</i>

03:02.630 --> 03:05.510
<i>"Your beloved is dead</i>

03:05.560 --> 03:10.240
<i>and buried".</i>

03:10.910 --> 03:14.300
<i>She always complained</i>

03:14.350 --> 03:18.910
<i>that she slept alone.</i>

03:20.180 --> 03:23.780
<i>Now she sleeps</i>

03:23.830 --> 03:29.330
<i>in the arms of Death.</i>

04:02.030 --> 04:03.430
After you, please.

04:03.690 --> 04:06.410
No, Mr. Chaucer, after you, please.

04:09.740 --> 04:11.180
It was nothing, sir.

04:11.340 --> 04:14.050
Nothing? You hurt me badly!

04:14.630 --> 04:16.620
You have a nose like a bludgeon.

04:17.470 --> 04:21.470
I was joking. I hope
I did not offend you.

04:22.190 --> 04:27.310
With jests and jokes
many truths can be told.

04:38.810 --> 04:41.050
I’m so skilled in the art of weaving,

04:41.100 --> 04:43.470
I can beat all those
bitches in Ypres and Ghent.

04:45.120 --> 04:48.090
In all modesty I can say...

04:48.140 --> 04:50.950
there's nobody better than me,

04:51.000 --> 04:55.810
especially for quests in church.

04:56.420 --> 04:59.940
And if any woman should try
to get the better of me

04:59.990 --> 05:03.950
I’ll make her cry and wish
she'd never been born.

05:04.000 --> 05:06.740
I'll eat her alive!

05:10.720 --> 05:13.640
<i>Three times I went to Jerusalem.</i>

05:13.990 --> 05:18.680
Then Rome, San Jacopo di
Compostela and Cologne.

05:20.680 --> 05:25.690
I’m no spring chicken,
but I know how to have fun

05:25.740 --> 05:28.320
and how to make people laugh.

05:29.160 --> 05:33.730
Between you and me,
I also know a few love potions.

05:36.820 --> 05:41.620
Because, my darlings,
I know all the old dances.

05:52.960 --> 05:56.880
Good folks, here are pardons
brought for you straight from Rome.

05:57.570 --> 06:02.730
A piece of the Virgin's veil,
a scrap of Saint Peter's sail,

06:02.780 --> 06:04.310
from when he used to sail,

06:04.590 --> 06:09.550
before Christ taught him
to walk on water.

06:09.770 --> 06:14.650
Radix malorum est cupiditas.
Cupidity is the root of all evil.

06:14.860 --> 06:18.600
Don't be miserly. Come, buy.

06:22.010 --> 06:25.560
Nowhere in the Gospels does
it say we should remain virgins.

06:25.710 --> 06:30.520
What were the genitals made for?
Not to lie there sleeping.

06:31.160 --> 06:34.210
And don't tell me they
were made just for peeing.

06:39.030 --> 06:40.410
Ladies and gentlemen...

06:41.160 --> 06:44.260
Quiet, your attention.
Please, be quiet.

06:44.310 --> 06:45.510
Folks, please...

06:48.120 --> 06:51.860
Gentle folks, truly I welcome you,

06:51.910 --> 06:54.720
from the bottom of my heart.

06:55.240 --> 06:58.790
Because in all these years

06:58.840 --> 07:01.780
I have never seen a finer company.

07:01.830 --> 07:04.520
You take the path to Canterbury.

07:04.990 --> 07:09.310
God be with you and the holy
blessed martyrs will reward you.

07:09.360 --> 07:13.240
But still, as experience is my teacher,

07:13.290 --> 07:15.880
I know that in such a long journey

07:15.930 --> 07:18.540
you may become dreadfully bored.

07:18.590 --> 07:21.650
Therefore accept my friendly advice.

07:22.220 --> 07:23.850
To shorten the way,

07:24.130 --> 07:27.890
each of you will tell a tale
on the road to Canterbury.

07:28.180 --> 07:31.260
I shall be the judge and your guide.

07:31.310 --> 07:35.540
I'll accompany you at my own expense,
until you reach Canterbury.

07:35.920 --> 07:38.110
Does everybody agree?

07:50.680 --> 07:51.950
Listen...

07:52.660 --> 07:54.300
I have decided to be a married man.

07:54.800 --> 07:57.030
No other life is as worthy.

07:58.230 --> 08:01.390
I am convinced
that marriage is paradise.

08:02.020 --> 08:06.910
When a man is old and grey, he
should take a beautiful young wife,

08:07.540 --> 08:09.870
to make an heir,

08:11.090 --> 08:13.550
and live a life of joy and pleasure.

08:15.450 --> 08:19.080
Everyone agrees on this.

08:19.610 --> 08:23.580
Some disagree, of whom
Theophrastus was one,

08:23.630 --> 08:27.950
but who gives a damn
if he enjoyed telling lies?

08:28.150 --> 08:32.409
Make arrangements for
my marriage immediately.

08:32.460 --> 08:34.130
I don't want to wait.

08:34.179 --> 08:39.520
But, dear friends, in no way
I want an old wife.

08:40.110 --> 08:41.299
Because I think

08:41.350 --> 08:44.159
one wants old fish and young flesh.

08:46.980 --> 08:51.640
I'll have no woman of thirty.
That doesn't suit me.

08:53.850 --> 08:56.610
A woman whom went to school
is like half a scholar.

08:57.140 --> 08:58.910
and I don't like them.

09:08.470 --> 09:09.870
Fuck.

09:27.510 --> 09:31.370
What pretty figures, pretty faces.

09:33.030 --> 09:36.970
By God, what pretty neighbours.

09:37.520 --> 09:39.670
The only problem is choosing.

09:41.590 --> 09:43.380
Hey, why not?

09:45.090 --> 09:46.590
Maggio...

09:52.010 --> 09:56.100
No... better not...

09:58.110 --> 09:59.710
Not bad...

10:01.790 --> 10:03.490
Yes...

10:26.710 --> 10:30.140
Hey brothers, come quickly!

10:32.900 --> 10:36.810
You don't need to search any
longer on foot and horseback.

10:36.980 --> 10:40.380
I have made my decision
and will not reverse it.

10:40.940 --> 10:44.150
I have found my mate,

10:44.200 --> 10:47.250
the solid foundation of my happiness.

10:47.600 --> 10:49.230
I have chosen Maggio.

10:49.280 --> 10:53.460
Come on, brothers.
Make a marriage contract.

10:53.510 --> 10:57.420
Publish the announcement.
My heart needs peace.

11:49.950 --> 11:52.800
My brother, in my heart

11:52.850 --> 11:55.590
I find a deep pity thought

11:55.640 --> 11:59.230
that I must harm her tonight.

12:01.060 --> 12:04.350
I am afraid she will not be able
to bear my assaults.

12:09.303 --> 12:13.170
God doesn't allow that I will
restrain my power.

12:13.590 --> 12:16.400
I wish these guests were gone.

12:20.800 --> 12:23.180
Stop eating, let the dancing begin.

13:29.140 --> 13:30.840
Okay, Father, that's enough.

13:34.170 --> 13:35.510
Hurry up, Father.

13:38.380 --> 13:40.150
Father, hurry.

13:52.440 --> 13:55.180
Go away, all of you!

14:04.580 --> 14:07.790
I must invade you now, my spouse...

14:08.190 --> 14:12.200
and make you suffer
before the pleasure starts.

14:13.510 --> 14:15.910
But remember,

14:15.960 --> 14:20.020
that no craftsman in the world

14:20.280 --> 14:23.100
can do his work well and quickly.

14:23.930 --> 14:27.650
But it doesn't matter
how long our play takes.

14:27.700 --> 14:29.580
We have all the time we want.

14:29.750 --> 14:32.610
Yes, my bride, we have

14:32.660 --> 14:37.030
the law of God and mankind on our side.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.020
I am ready!

15:12.430 --> 15:14.330
I did it!

16:43.960 --> 16:46.160
MY DEAR MAGGIO
I LOVE YOU WITH ALL MY HEART

16:46.460 --> 16:48.860
AND IF I CANNOT MAKE LOVE TO YOU

16:49.160 --> 16:51.360
I WILL DIE

17:02.620 --> 17:04.650
I want to rest, it is almost day.

17:05.079 --> 17:08.640
I am a little tired. That was
the second time, you know.

18:04.680 --> 18:09.600
You'll see, my Columbine,
how beautiful this garden is.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.210
I doubt that the author of
"Romance della Rosa"

18:13.260 --> 18:18.110
could describe the beauty
of this garden.

18:19.920 --> 18:23.540
Now summer has come again,
and only in this garden

18:23.590 --> 18:28.640
I will do my duty as a husband.

18:32.820 --> 18:35.650
No one but I can enter this garden.

18:36.010 --> 18:41.360
No one holds the key, no one
but myself alone, understand?

18:42.110 --> 18:44.460
I carry it with me always.

19:18.550 --> 19:22.700
Maggio, little wife, lie beside me.

20:00.550 --> 20:02.950
MY DEAR DAMIANO
I LOVE YOU TOO WITH ALL MY HEART

20:03.250 --> 20:05.250
I WILL MAKE A KEY FOR THE GARDEN

20:05.550 --> 20:07.950
AND THERE WE CAN MAKE LOVE

20:24.800 --> 20:30.040
Somebody help me!
I am blind, you imbeciles!

20:34.260 --> 20:38.200
Maggio, help me, I am blind!

20:45.420 --> 20:47.520
Maggio, where are you?

20:59.700 --> 21:01.580
Ah, there you are.

21:01.630 --> 21:06.480
Where are you going?
From now on I'll hold on to you.

21:06.530 --> 21:09.570
I can't see you, but
I'll never let you go.

21:42.080 --> 21:46.240
Everyone get out!
I don't want anybody!

21:46.820 --> 21:52.020
Leave me alone with Maggio!
Get out, all of you!

22:20.260 --> 22:25.060
Lead me to my garden, my lovely garden.

22:25.110 --> 22:27.660
My garden, I shall never see it again.

22:38.330 --> 22:40.290
This is what happens to the poor Gennaio.

22:40.440 --> 22:42.480
But as compensation,

22:42.530 --> 22:46.050
the moment his wife
is about to dishonour him,

22:46.100 --> 22:49.100
I shall give him back his sight,
to see her betrayal.

22:49.150 --> 22:51.150
You can if you wish, but if you do,

22:51.200 --> 22:54.720
I shall give her the power of words.

22:54.770 --> 22:57.570
Don't be angry, I give in.

22:57.720 --> 23:01.260
But I gave my word.
And kings must keep their word.

23:01.650 --> 23:06.100
And you know I am a queen.
I have to keep my word as well.

23:06.580 --> 23:09.440
And you, my dear, must
not be angry with me.

23:27.780 --> 23:30.210
Are we there, my love?

23:30.630 --> 23:35.840
Come now, lie on the
grass, my sweet little wife.

23:35.890 --> 23:39.280
Body sweeter than
wine, divine eyes.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.930
Ay, my belly!

23:41.120 --> 23:44.160
I would love to eat those lovely
blackberries up on the tree.

23:44.930 --> 23:49.690
Sweet, fruitful wife, there is
no boy here to climb the tree

23:49.740 --> 23:51.840
and I am old and blind.

23:51.890 --> 23:54.290
Never mind, come over here.

23:58.710 --> 24:03.320
Careful, my dear.
Don't hurt yourself.

24:04.620 --> 24:07.840
Yes, that's it. Very good.

24:07.890 --> 24:11.880
I'd give my blood to help you.

24:20.440 --> 24:22.640
Are the blackberries ripe?

24:24.030 --> 24:28.440
Eat, my child, eat as you like.

24:34.710 --> 24:38.720
My eyes... I can see!

24:52.460 --> 24:55.110
What are you doing, slut?

24:55.420 --> 24:57.220
You can see!

24:57.750 --> 24:59.350
It's a miracle!

25:07.220 --> 25:08.620
I'm so happy.

25:08.670 --> 25:12.430
I saw you! Making love with a man!

25:13.080 --> 25:17.840
I saw it with my own eyes,
up in the tree.

25:17.890 --> 25:19.630
You are confused.

25:19.680 --> 25:22.450
After being blind,
it's not possible to see clearly.

25:23.640 --> 25:25.910
Jealousy made you see phantoms.

25:28.120 --> 25:32.820
Husband, your sight is restored.
Let's thank God for this miracle.

25:37.010 --> 25:42.210
Yes, little wife, let's forget everything.

25:42.500 --> 25:46.220
And may the Lord forgive me
for thinking bad of you.

25:54.010 --> 25:59.910
You are even more beautiful than
I remembered, my sweet Maggio.

29:29.260 --> 29:31.420
Listen... one minute...

29:36.300 --> 29:37.400
Virgin Mary...

29:37.850 --> 29:40.340
Behind the market, in the fish alley...

29:40.930 --> 29:44.670
No, not the old market, the new one.
At the bottom of the fish alley.

29:45.730 --> 29:47.230
I have found two.

30:18.130 --> 30:21.620
My friend, for your wife's sake
I'll erase you from our Black Book.

30:22.160 --> 30:25.760
Relax, don't look so afraid.
This time you'll be fine.

30:26.240 --> 30:30.020
I am your friend and want to help you.
How much did we say?

30:30.070 --> 30:32.630
Three, four hundred... everything.

30:33.910 --> 30:37.610
Don't denounce me for my sin
of lust, for the love of God!

30:51.220 --> 30:55.980
You swear by Christ you don't have
any coin to give me?

30:56.030 --> 30:58.910
It's the truth, my lord, I swear.

30:59.510 --> 31:01.770
My friend, I do this for your sake.

31:02.410 --> 31:06.130
But I am a poor man, have mercy on me.

31:06.460 --> 31:09.940
Ask the judge for mercy.
You'll be fried, my friend.

31:48.590 --> 31:51.290
Fritters... fritters...

33:20.770 --> 33:22.670
Just a minute, we're coming!

35:12.580 --> 35:16.770
Excellent, my friend, you've
done yourself much honour.

35:17.440 --> 35:19.450
I have new tasks for you.

35:39.770 --> 35:42.370
Good morning, sir. Nice to meet you.

35:42.790 --> 35:45.880
Welcome. Are you going far away?

35:46.110 --> 35:49.750
No, nearby, to collect
a debt for my boss.

35:49.950 --> 35:53.450
Are you a debt collector? So am I.

35:53.790 --> 35:56.720
But I'm a stranger.
I don't know anybody here.

35:57.470 --> 36:00.310
Shall we be friends and brothers?

36:01.110 --> 36:02.640
Why not? On my word of honour.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.620
Give me your hand.

36:14.430 --> 36:17.280
Let's swear to be brothers
until the day we die.

36:17.970 --> 36:19.120
I swear.

36:21.200 --> 36:23.050
Brother, where is your district,

36:23.100 --> 36:26.360
if some day I would need you?

36:27.580 --> 36:30.640
Far away, behind the mountains.

36:31.210 --> 36:34.740
I hope that soon you
will visit me up there.

36:36.870 --> 36:39.650
Okay brother, as we are
both rent collectors,

36:39.700 --> 36:42.990
teach me a trick or two
to earn more money.

36:43.870 --> 36:48.450
Forget conscience or sin, speak
frankly, as brother to brother.

36:49.020 --> 36:53.850
My wages are small and
I have to manage somehow.

36:54.660 --> 36:56.950
So I live by extortion and blackmail.

36:57.710 --> 37:01.640
So do I. Without them
I could not survive.

37:02.230 --> 37:04.530
I know neither pity nor conscience.

37:05.430 --> 37:08.240
We are made to be together.

37:08.610 --> 37:10.630
Tell me, brother, what is your name?

37:20.480 --> 37:23.140
Brother, do you really want to know?

37:24.250 --> 37:27.360
I am the Devil and I dwell in hell.

37:27.760 --> 37:31.110
I ride to earn a living, just as you do.

37:31.600 --> 37:34.670
You cheat without scruples, just as I do.

37:35.350 --> 37:40.310
I will keep you good company
until you will abandon me.

37:40.640 --> 37:43.240
Even if you're the Devil,
I'll keep our sworn promise.

37:44.500 --> 37:45.910
We're both out for profit.

37:45.960 --> 37:50.150
We could share what we make.
I take my part, you take yours.

37:50.200 --> 37:54.290
That is, you take all
that men want to give you.

37:54.510 --> 37:59.400
Perfect, agreed. You'll take
your part while I will take

37:59.450 --> 38:02.350
everything that men want to give me.

38:12.670 --> 38:17.690
Here lives an old woman who'd rather
break her neck than part with a penny.

38:17.740 --> 38:22.380
I want twelve pence from her,
under threat of summoning her to court.

38:23.030 --> 38:26.010
She's not guilty
of the smallest of sins.

38:26.260 --> 38:30.290
Watch how we do things, since you
are new in this. And learn.

38:33.950 --> 38:37.340
God bless you, gentlemen.
What can I do for you?

38:38.810 --> 38:42.140
I have an order. On penalty
of excommunication

38:42.190 --> 38:45.320
you must appear before
the archdeacon tomorrow

38:45.370 --> 38:50.510
and inform the court about certain things.
I am sure you know what I mean.

38:50.690 --> 38:52.850
Give me twelve pence, and I'll
see that you're acquitted.

38:53.190 --> 38:57.250
Where will I find twelve
pence, in the name of Holy Mary?

38:58.070 --> 39:01.920
In all my life I've never had,
even seen twelve pence.

39:02.410 --> 39:05.610
Have pity for the poor old.

39:05.660 --> 39:07.660
Pay up, or I'll take your pitcher.

39:07.710 --> 39:11.640
You owe me the fine I paid for you

39:11.690 --> 39:13.540
when you first cuckolded your husband.

39:13.690 --> 39:17.230
Liar! I've never been
summoned to court in my life.

39:17.980 --> 39:20.540
And I've never been wicked with my body.

39:21.040 --> 39:24.950
I hope the devil will take
your body and my pitcher too.

39:26.010 --> 39:28.210
Dear madame, mother...

39:30.290 --> 39:35.760
Did you really seriously mean
the words you just spoke?

39:35.810 --> 39:41.170
Yes, the Devil take him alive, and
the pitcher, unless he repents.

39:41.220 --> 39:44.850
No, you old witch, have no hope.

39:44.900 --> 39:49.700
I won't repent for what I take
from you, no matter what happens.

40:27.160 --> 40:29.480
Brother, don't take it wrong.

40:30.160 --> 40:35.560
This pitcher and your
body are mine by right.

40:35.820 --> 40:39.940
This very night you
will come with me to hell.

40:39.990 --> 40:45.360
There you'll learn more from our secrets
than a Master of Theology.

41:37.660 --> 41:41.660
NOTES FOR A BOOK
TALES OF PILGRIMS EN ROUTE TO CANTERBURY

41:42.960 --> 41:46.120
TALE OF THE COOK

41:47.010 --> 41:50.760
Get out, asshole!

41:52.260 --> 41:54.060
You've finished here!

41:55.920 --> 41:58.190
Don't show your face here again!

43:06.570 --> 43:07.870
Stop there!

43:31.290 --> 43:33.480
I'll get you, rotten little thief!

45:59.960 --> 46:04.980
You got the sack? You are
a disgrace to your family.

46:05.960 --> 46:09.210
I'm sure your mother had
you by an Italian, not me.

46:09.260 --> 46:13.010
Go to bed at once! No dinner for you!

46:31.410 --> 46:34.260
Eat, my son. Don't let
your father see you.

46:34.710 --> 46:38.230
Be a good boy.
Find another job tomorrow.

46:38.940 --> 46:40.760
Promise me, in the name of God.

46:50.180 --> 46:52.990
Master, do you have a job for me?

46:54.180 --> 46:56.940
I do need a boy. I'll try you out.

47:05.240 --> 47:06.860
Shine the eggs.

47:07.310 --> 47:09.520
Shine, shine. And be careful.

47:29.710 --> 47:31.490
Hey! What have you done?

47:32.260 --> 47:33.760
It's nothing, Master.

47:51.520 --> 47:54.890
It's a miracle. Let me see.

48:02.310 --> 48:03.810
What a pity.

48:05.570 --> 48:07.070
What an omelette.

48:18.360 --> 48:21.470
- I must go out for a moment.
- Okay, Master.

48:21.710 --> 48:24.940
You stay here and work.
Serve the customers well.

48:35.610 --> 48:37.570
Why not come and play with us?

49:06.080 --> 49:08.200
Can I join your game?

49:30.270 --> 49:33.470
Scoundrel! You're sacked!

49:33.840 --> 49:37.820
Better cast forth the rotten
apple before it rots all the rest.

49:38.490 --> 49:39.890
You're right.

50:39.130 --> 50:41.690
Perkin, come and meet my good wife.

50:44.520 --> 50:45.660
She's a whore.

51:43.390 --> 51:45.090
Perkin, dirty faggot!

51:45.380 --> 51:47.780
I declare you under arrest.

51:48.050 --> 51:51.540
You will be imprisoned in London,
pending your trial.

53:23.540 --> 53:25.240
Geoffrey Chaucer!

53:26.610 --> 53:28.210
Yes, my wife.

53:51.910 --> 53:54.020
Robin, come here!

54:35.280 --> 54:40.470
Alison, if I can't have you now,
my passion for you will kill me.

54:43.910 --> 54:47.020
Love me, or I swear I'll die.

54:47.070 --> 54:51.620
Let go of me, Nicolas.
Let go or I'll scream.

54:54.040 --> 54:55.820
Keep your hands off me.

54:56.070 --> 55:00.830
Alison, my dear love.
I want not only your body.

55:00.880 --> 55:03.080
I am in love with you with all my soul.

55:03.360 --> 55:07.230
I'll be your servant, your
slave, if you love me a little.

55:08.160 --> 55:10.830
In that case, if you swear it...

55:10.880 --> 55:11.980
I swear!

55:14.270 --> 55:15.760
Then I will give you my love.

55:15.810 --> 55:17.070
But when?

55:17.120 --> 55:22.950
My husband is jealous. Guard
your secret well, or I'll be dead.

55:23.340 --> 55:27.460
Then do as I tell you. Bring me
a basket with food for three days.

55:27.510 --> 55:29.340
I'll be locked in my room.

55:29.390 --> 55:33.330
Then, do just as I tell you.
And don't worry.

55:33.540 --> 55:36.940
A student wouldn't be worth much
if he couldn't outwit a carpenter.

55:38.460 --> 55:39.960
Once more!

55:41.420 --> 55:45.880
Eggs, meat, vegetables, fruit...
Enough food for three days.

56:10.030 --> 56:13.790
<i>Bend which is rigid.</i>

56:19.390 --> 56:23.640
<i>For everlasting joy.</i>

56:52.080 --> 56:53.680
Time to go, Martin.

57:00.070 --> 57:01.370
Am I handsome?

57:13.540 --> 57:16.620
Oh, Alison, my love.

57:29.570 --> 57:32.440
Master Gervase, always working, eh?

57:33.010 --> 57:37.280
When I was your age I liked to give
"incense" to all the parish wives too.

58:21.890 --> 58:26.160
Alison, do you hear Absalon
singing under our window?

58:26.430 --> 58:29.380
Yes, Giovanni. I hear every single note.

58:30.140 --> 58:32.430
It's that valse sacristan

58:32.880 --> 58:36.940
and thinks only of decking
himself out and eyeing females?

58:38.180 --> 58:39.590
That's him exactly.

58:39.640 --> 58:44.820
They say he minds his words
and is squeamish about farting.

58:46.040 --> 58:49.960
Go sleep. You must be tired
after your journey to Osney.

58:50.930 --> 58:54.310
Listen to Absalon,
chirping like a nightingale.

59:07.850 --> 59:11.260
You're sure you haven't
seen our student all day?

59:11.540 --> 59:16.940
Yes, sure. I have sent Jill too,
but there was no answer.

59:17.300 --> 59:19.300
Robin, let's go and see.

59:33.770 --> 59:35.310
Help us, Saint Frithuswith.

59:35.490 --> 59:36.740
She's made of stone.

59:37.370 --> 59:41.020
By Saint Thomas, I feel
sorry for our dear Nicolas.

59:42.100 --> 59:43.310
I will go inside

59:43.440 --> 59:47.830
and gently shake him
out of his meditations.

59:53.410 --> 59:56.410
May I come in?

59:59.620 --> 01:00:03.160
What's the matter? Look
down and think of our Lord.

01:00:04.620 --> 01:00:09.010
I'll make the sign of the cross to
protect you from elves and spirits.

01:00:10.110 --> 01:00:13.800
Jesus Christ and Saint Benedict,
protect this house.

01:00:20.590 --> 01:00:23.640
The whole world will vanish soon.

01:00:23.690 --> 01:00:28.900
By my astrology I have found out
that on next Monday

01:00:28.950 --> 01:00:33.340
a fierce rain will fall,
double of Noah's flood.

01:00:33.890 --> 01:00:38.520
Within an hour mankind will be drowned.

01:00:38.570 --> 01:00:43.720
My poor wife. Oh God. Will
my poor Alison drown too?

01:00:44.130 --> 01:00:46.270
Is there no remedy?

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:47.920
Yes, there is.

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:53.830
Follow my advice and I promise
I will save her, you and I.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:56.430
We don't have time.

01:00:56.480 --> 01:00:59.040
Go and get a trough or a tub immediately.

01:00:59.090 --> 01:01:00.810
We need one for each of us.

01:01:01.110 --> 01:01:05.970
They must be big enough to float.
And we need food for one day.

01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:10.670
The rain will stop and retire
at 9 o'clock the next morning.

01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:13.710
Send away your servants Robin and Jill.

01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:19.460
When you've found tubs, hang
them high to the roof, out of sight.

01:01:19.510 --> 01:01:24.390
Put an axe in each, so we can cut
the ropes when the water comes.

01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:29.770
Then we will float like lords, safe and
sound, as did Noah and his wife.

01:01:30.800 --> 01:01:33.420
You and your wife must keep well apart.

01:01:33.870 --> 01:01:37.980
Woe for any man who
commits carnal sin in this night.

01:01:42.030 --> 01:01:45.170
Go to work now, and God be with you.

01:02:10.050 --> 01:02:12.110
Quickly, let's go on board.

01:03:00.140 --> 01:03:02.140
That's enough now. Quiet!

01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:24.210
Absalon, come here. Listen.

01:03:26.360 --> 01:03:30.960
The carpenter hasn't been seen all day.
Maybe he went to London.

01:03:31.010 --> 01:03:32.960
Your girl is alone in her bed.

01:03:33.090 --> 01:03:35.290
Yes? Then I'll run there.

01:03:58.910 --> 01:04:00.510
Let's go.

01:04:08.265 --> 01:04:11.940
- Get your smock off.
- No, I want to see you.

01:04:11.990 --> 01:04:15.730
You first. I want to see it.

01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:47.060
You lucky devil, Absalon.

01:04:59.230 --> 01:05:02.640
Alison, it's me, Absalon.

01:05:06.990 --> 01:05:09.650
What are you doing, my honey?

01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:13.500
Alison, my sweet flower, beautiful bird.

01:05:13.550 --> 01:05:16.170
Wake up, say something.

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.020
It's Absalon.

01:05:19.520 --> 01:05:22.980
He's tried to win me with many gifts.

01:05:23.690 --> 01:05:28.740
Sweet wine, hydromel,
beer brewed with spices.

01:05:29.330 --> 01:05:33.870
Cultivated fruits,
hot wafers from the stove.

01:05:36.230 --> 01:05:39.280
And as I'm a city girl, money too.

01:05:42.440 --> 01:05:47.110
My love, I feel a love so great,
I'm fluttering like a turtle dove.

01:05:47.160 --> 01:05:51.840
You fool! Better go away, because I
love another man better than you.

01:05:51.890 --> 01:05:54.580
I know... True love
is always unfortunate.

01:05:54.630 --> 01:05:59.090
If I cannot hope for
more, give me just a kiss.

01:06:00.210 --> 01:06:02.160
If I do, will you go?

01:06:02.210 --> 01:06:04.010
Certainly, my love.

01:06:05.870 --> 01:06:08.030
Then lick your lips, I'm coming.

01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:14.200
Be quiet, you'll die laughing.

01:06:17.030 --> 01:06:19.410
Quick, so the neighbours don't see.

01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:25.670
I am a gentleman now.
After this I would like more.

01:06:39.330 --> 01:06:43.820
What have you done,
Alison? You'll pay for it!

01:06:58.670 --> 01:07:01.380
- Master Gervase.
- What is it, Absalon?

01:07:03.010 --> 01:07:05.810
Which beautiful girl has got you outside?

01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:12.390
Lend me that poker from the
fire, I'll bring it back at once.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.840
Take it. But why do you want it?

01:07:17.810 --> 01:07:19.680
I'll tell you tomorrow.

01:07:41.610 --> 01:07:47.170
Alison, it's me again,
your Absalon, my love.

01:07:47.270 --> 01:07:48.470
What do you want?

01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:53.020
I've brought you a golden ring,
my mother gave me. It's beautiful.

01:07:53.470 --> 01:07:55.610
It's yours for another kiss.

01:07:55.860 --> 01:07:57.460
It's my turn now.

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.020
Leave it to me.

01:08:02.950 --> 01:08:07.260
Alison, where are you?
Just one more kiss.

01:08:10.410 --> 01:08:12.910
Speak, sweetheart,
so I know where you are.

01:08:18.310 --> 01:08:20.680
Water, for the love of God! Water!

01:08:21.870 --> 01:08:24.229
My God, it's Noah's flood!

01:08:33.810 --> 01:08:36.340
Come on, husband, come on!

01:08:36.390 --> 01:08:38.350
You know what women are like.

01:08:39.090 --> 01:08:43.229
We need to talk,
because we are capricious.

01:08:43.939 --> 01:08:46.210
The less you give it,
the more we want it.

01:08:46.260 --> 01:08:47.359
Are you finished?

01:08:48.200 --> 01:08:51.350
Nothing "sssh". I'm not here
for your wish and desire.

01:09:10.040 --> 01:09:12.109
Mary, get some water for your master.

01:09:33.609 --> 01:09:35.210
What a lovely arse!

01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:52.859
Lisotta!

01:10:03.230 --> 01:10:04.630
What is it?

01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:19.980
Adorable...

01:10:48.070 --> 01:10:49.470
Bitch.

01:11:07.400 --> 01:11:09.000
Ah, dear neighbour.

01:11:09.130 --> 01:11:12.970
This is Mr. Gianozzo, my new
boarder, a student at Oxford.

01:11:14.020 --> 01:11:17.290
- Nice to meet you.
- The pleasure is all mine.

01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:22.270
I think I have seen you
somewhere before.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:24.080
Who knows where?

01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:41.510
What a fine, young stud.

01:11:42.420 --> 01:11:45.820
But me too. All my husbands have told me

01:11:47.190 --> 01:11:49.020
I have the best little pussy

01:11:49.070 --> 01:11:53.250
of the whole city of Bath.

01:11:54.060 --> 01:11:56.720
But you are married,
if I'm not mistaken.

01:11:57.010 --> 01:11:59.820
Without bragging, you will never find me

01:11:59.870 --> 01:12:03.730
without plans for weddings and so. Never.

01:12:03.780 --> 01:12:05.260
And if you really want to know...

01:12:05.480 --> 01:12:10.160
I think that mouse has
only one hole to hide.

01:12:11.880 --> 01:12:13.130
If you want...

01:12:13.710 --> 01:12:16.880
I could go with him to a
procession tomorrow.

01:12:43.790 --> 01:12:49.620
Oh, my sweet husband, beloved husband!

01:12:49.670 --> 01:12:51.940
Why are you leaving me?

01:12:58.680 --> 01:13:01.510
Never again... Never again.

01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:04.060
I came here to speak to you.

01:15:06.040 --> 01:15:07.590
Then speak.

01:15:07.640 --> 01:15:11.920
You have bewitched me,
no need to deny it.

01:15:16.190 --> 01:15:18.100
I dreamt of you all night.

01:15:19.290 --> 01:15:21.120
You tried to kill me

01:15:21.540 --> 01:15:23.810
as I lay down on my back

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:26.810
and my bed was covered in blood.

01:15:29.710 --> 01:15:31.540
You have bewitched me.

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:33.860
So, you'll have to marry me.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:39.080
Marry? But I'm too young.

01:15:40.160 --> 01:15:43.180
You see, my husband is dying

01:15:43.630 --> 01:15:47.140
and those who know such things

01:15:47.190 --> 01:15:49.790
agree it's a propitious dream.

01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:52.620
Because blood...

01:15:53.250 --> 01:15:55.770
means gold.

01:16:31.870 --> 01:16:33.670
Lisotta, my hat.

01:16:38.710 --> 01:16:40.510
How do I look?

01:16:56.070 --> 01:16:58.990
Gianozzo, will you take
this woman here present

01:16:59.040 --> 01:17:03.070
as your wedded wife by the
sacred rite of our Mother Church?

01:17:03.960 --> 01:17:06.210
Alice, do you take
this man here present

01:17:06.260 --> 01:17:09.920
as your wedded husband by the
sacred rite of our Mother Church?

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:20.460
And this is for the peeing of my dearly,

01:17:20.510 --> 01:17:24.240
beloved fifth husband.

01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:47.990
I hope I won't regret giving
you all the lands and rents

01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:52.760
left me by four husbands before you.

01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:10.780
In this book is everything.

01:18:12.010 --> 01:18:16.120
And what is that "everything"...

01:18:16.170 --> 01:18:18.120
for Saint Iodoca's sake?

01:18:20.160 --> 01:18:23.130
It tells of Simplicius Gallus,

01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:26.680
who left his wife for all time,

01:18:27.090 --> 01:18:29.110
because once he caught her

01:18:29.880 --> 01:18:32.110
looking outside.

01:18:32.540 --> 01:18:34.580
And Eva, with her perversity,

01:18:35.680 --> 01:18:38.040
has led men to misery,

01:18:38.390 --> 01:18:40.560
and Christ to the Cross.

01:18:42.710 --> 01:18:44.360
Xhanthippe now...

01:18:45.510 --> 01:18:49.390
Xhanthippe poured a
piss-pot over Socrates' head...

01:18:49.890 --> 01:18:55.050
and the saintly man wiped
his head and quietly said:

01:18:57.020 --> 01:19:00.360
"Before the thunder stops,
the rain will fall."

01:19:05.640 --> 01:19:10.870
I hate people who dare
tell me my faults,

01:19:10.920 --> 01:19:14.540
like you think you can do!

01:19:14.590 --> 01:19:17.480
You piece of shit! Swine!

01:19:30.638 --> 01:19:34.960
You killed me so you
could enjoy in peace...

01:19:37.340 --> 01:19:39.990
all my land and my money.

01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:44.980
But I forgive you, and before I die...

01:19:47.440 --> 01:19:50.310
Come here, give me one more kiss.

01:19:50.650 --> 01:19:53.250
God, curse me for what I've done.

01:19:54.010 --> 01:19:57.340
Forgive me. I beg you, my dear.

01:19:57.910 --> 01:20:00.340
Yes, I forgive you.

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.680
My nose! My nose!

01:20:20.670 --> 01:20:24.270
Rector, I do regret this illness

01:20:24.660 --> 01:20:29.250
that keeps me in
bed like a newborn baby.

01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:33.420
What grieves me more,
they take advantage.

01:20:33.470 --> 01:20:38.880
Simone the miller steals
100 times more flour than before.

01:20:39.020 --> 01:20:40.470
Sir Rector!

01:20:43.070 --> 01:20:45.210
As our manciple is dying,

01:20:45.260 --> 01:20:47.940
or looks as if he's about to,

01:20:47.990 --> 01:20:51.760
why not let us go and watch
the miller grind our corn?

01:20:53.020 --> 01:20:58.140
Good, you'd like to take on this task.

01:20:58.660 --> 01:21:02.580
We bet the miller won't steal
not even one kilo of corn,

01:21:02.630 --> 01:21:04.310
not by trickery nor force.

01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:16.500
Okay, then go, gentle students.

01:21:17.160 --> 01:21:19.650
Perhaps it is the best solution.

01:21:20.390 --> 01:21:23.210
May the good Lord protect you.

01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:27.270
<i>Bend which is cold.</i>

01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:32.670
<i>Heat up which is rigid.</i>

01:21:34.540 --> 01:21:39.360
<i>For everlasting joy.</i>

01:21:40.640 --> 01:21:43.690
How lovely to go around
with nothing to do.

01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:47.080
Why always be locked in school?
See how huge the world is.

01:21:47.130 --> 01:21:49.670
You'd like a good screw now, Gianni?

01:21:49.720 --> 01:21:53.140
We're worse than monks,
arses tight and dicks hard.

01:21:53.580 --> 01:21:55.380
Freedom! Freedom!

01:22:07.110 --> 01:22:10.070
Simone, how is it going?

01:22:11.470 --> 01:22:16.490
How are you, your pretty
daughter and your wife?

01:22:17.340 --> 01:22:18.940
Not bad at all, I see.

01:22:21.710 --> 01:22:25.180
What a lovely surprise, two
students instead of the manciple.

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:27.270
What brings you here?

01:22:27.320 --> 01:22:29.890
Our manciple is dying.

01:22:31.020 --> 01:22:34.700
So we've come to grind our corn.

01:22:34.750 --> 01:22:37.080
What will you do while I grind it?

01:22:37.870 --> 01:22:41.320
I'll stand by the funnel
to see the corn go in.

01:22:41.370 --> 01:22:45.060
By the blood of my father,
I never saw the wheel work.

01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:51.210
You do that and I'll go below
and watch the flour fall.

01:22:52.130 --> 01:22:54.870
Because I'm a bad miller too, like Gianni.

01:22:56.120 --> 01:23:00.240
Okay, guys. Get your sack
off the horse and bring it here.

01:23:00.290 --> 01:23:02.970
- Who takes the bag?
- Give it to me.

01:23:09.430 --> 01:23:11.790
Milling is a great job, eh, guys?

01:23:12.420 --> 01:23:15.020
Make yourself at home, get to work.

01:23:18.210 --> 01:23:22.210
Boss, start the sails,
we're ready. Come on!

01:23:24.340 --> 01:23:26.710
They think they can't be tricked.

01:23:27.010 --> 01:23:28.410
They are naive.

01:23:28.460 --> 01:23:31.630
I'll give them bran instead of
flour, for all their philosophy.

01:23:31.680 --> 01:23:34.470
Students are not always more intelligent.

01:23:34.670 --> 01:23:37.400
The more they think they're
clever, the more I'll rob them.

01:24:37.790 --> 01:24:41.580
There you are, guys, done in a trice.

01:24:42.170 --> 01:24:43.760
Amusing... the funnel.

01:24:44.920 --> 01:24:47.490
Interesting... the working of the trough.

01:24:59.930 --> 01:25:04.430
The horse has escaped.
The horse of our Rector.

01:25:04.620 --> 01:25:06.220
Which way did he go?

01:25:06.370 --> 01:25:10.220
Your horse went to the
mares, fast as the wind.

01:25:10.320 --> 01:25:12.610
He can't escape us both.

01:25:13.460 --> 01:25:16.080
Why didn't you put him in the stall?

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:21.840
Get their bag and we'll fill
half of it with bran.

01:25:22.090 --> 01:25:25.180
See them run, they are
like playing children.

01:25:47.290 --> 01:25:49.720
Turmine, where are you?

01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:59.410
Leave the mares alone!

01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:50.780
You're as tired and wet as
two animals out in the rain.

01:26:50.830 --> 01:26:56.280
We've caught the horse, but we beg for
your hospitality, for the love of God.

01:26:56.330 --> 01:26:58.300
For the love of God and our money.

01:26:58.350 --> 01:27:01.870
Of course. My house is small,
but share my humble home.

01:27:01.920 --> 01:27:05.360
Still, you students can always make
something big from something small.

01:27:10.290 --> 01:27:13.280
Have a drink with your
old friend the miller.

01:27:29.310 --> 01:27:31.790
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

01:27:38.701 --> 01:27:43.080
Are you asleep, Gianni?
Did you ever hear music like this?

01:27:43.580 --> 01:27:47.820
Listen, what a concert.
The miller is snoring like a horse.

01:27:48.120 --> 01:27:50.740
You could stick a tail in his arse.

01:27:51.710 --> 01:27:53.570
Who wants to sleep tonight?

01:27:55.640 --> 01:27:59.260
I'll be damned if I
don't hump that girl.

01:28:00.290 --> 01:28:02.520
I'm entitled to compensation

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:07.020
for the grain that's been stolen from us.

01:28:07.550 --> 01:28:12.110
Mind the miller doesn't wake
up, or we'll be damned.

01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.610
He's no more worth than a flea.

01:28:15.110 --> 01:28:19.010
You go ahead with his daughter,

01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:21.940
while I stay here
like a sack of potatoes?

01:28:22.370 --> 01:28:26.370
They'll say I was a sissy or a fool.

01:28:27.320 --> 01:28:29.180
Feel this!

01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:35.140
What about me?

01:29:31.080 --> 01:29:35.090
I'm dying for a pee, I'm bursting.

01:29:41.180 --> 01:29:43.680
Dammit, the cradle.

01:30:26.120 --> 01:30:28.670
Where is the cradle?

01:30:30.680 --> 01:30:32.980
I nearly got in the wrong bed.

01:30:40.894 --> 01:30:45.280
My husband, it's long since you did
anything like this. What's happening?

01:30:46.170 --> 01:30:47.810
Shut up, get on with it.

01:30:48.190 --> 01:30:53.380
Molly, my love, sweet, little pussy.

01:30:54.190 --> 01:30:56.390
Very well, husband, very well.

01:31:12.230 --> 01:31:14.870
Farewell, Molly. It's dawn
and I cannot stay,

01:31:14.920 --> 01:31:18.080
but I'll always be your student.

01:31:18.420 --> 01:31:22.110
Farewell, my love. But before you go,
I must tell you one thing.

01:31:22.160 --> 01:31:26.160
When you leave the mill,
just behind the door,

01:31:26.210 --> 01:31:30.010
you'll find a cake,
made with your stolen flour.

01:31:30.640 --> 01:31:32.740
God keep you safe.

01:31:50.012 --> 01:31:53.910
Hey, Gianni. Wake up.
Listen how it went.

01:31:55.780 --> 01:32:00.240
I've screwed the miller's daughter
three times while you laid here afraid.

01:32:00.340 --> 01:32:05.340
You filthy devil, you traitor!
I'll murder you!

01:32:26.190 --> 01:32:28.620
Bye-bye, my love. Bye.

01:32:28.670 --> 01:32:32.100
Gianni, it's baked with our flour.

01:32:37.290 --> 01:32:40.970
<i>Bend which is rigid.</i>

01:32:41.770 --> 01:32:45.880
<i>Heat up which is cold.</i>

01:32:46.470 --> 01:32:50.150
<i>For everlasting joy.</i>

01:32:50.680 --> 01:32:54.440
<i>Amen.</i>

01:33:41.870 --> 01:33:43.610
Why don't you cut it off?

01:33:43.830 --> 01:33:45.230
Bitch.

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.160
Come here.

01:34:09.690 --> 01:34:11.090
Whore!

01:34:29.190 --> 01:34:30.790
A second time.

01:34:33.020 --> 01:34:34.880
Just a second, wait.
- What is it?

01:34:35.230 --> 01:34:37.090
Tell me you are my queen.

01:34:37.620 --> 01:34:39.110
I am your queen.

01:34:50.270 --> 01:34:55.610
My sweet love, my little
pigeon, my sweet little flower.

01:35:23.060 --> 01:35:24.910
Saint Paul said:

01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:28.920
"God shall destroy the food in the stomach
and the stomach for the food."

01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:32.580
Cook, make me two eggs.

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:51.390
Take that, women sent by the
Devil to light the fires of lust.

01:35:51.520 --> 01:35:54.180
Fuel for your whores.

01:35:54.230 --> 01:35:56.940
Why don't you piss wine?

01:35:59.020 --> 01:36:03.620
You'll pay for your drunken
sin in eternal hell-fire.

01:36:04.640 --> 01:36:06.180
Wine is a lecherous thing.

01:36:06.230 --> 01:36:09.860
Drunkenness is the root
of misfortune, you drunks.

01:36:09.910 --> 01:36:14.870
Your face is putrid, your breath
is rancid and your embrace foul.

01:36:15.110 --> 01:36:16.910
Why aren't you all like Samson?

01:36:17.090 --> 01:36:20.690
Samson never touched
a drop of wine, read the Bible.

01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:26.290
Rufo, go and piss on your whore's head.

01:36:30.580 --> 01:36:35.010
I've preached against gluttony,
now I warn you about gambling.

01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:40.940
Gambling is the father
of lies and trickery,

01:36:41.350 --> 01:36:45.500
the father of blasphemy against Christ.

01:36:46.030 --> 01:36:50.020
A prince who gambles
loses the respect to reign.

01:36:50.070 --> 01:36:52.580
Understand that, you ignorants!

01:37:22.640 --> 01:37:24.340
Who's dead?
- You, go outside

01:37:24.390 --> 01:37:28.040
and ask what happened and his name.

01:37:28.090 --> 01:37:33.770
I don't need to ask.
He was a good friend of yours.

01:37:33.820 --> 01:37:37.620
He was killed this night,
sitting dead drunk on a bench.

01:37:37.670 --> 01:37:42.110
A thief called Death
stabbed his heart with a lance.

01:37:42.160 --> 01:37:45.330
He left without a word.
That's all I know.

01:37:45.910 --> 01:37:47.180
It's like this.

01:37:47.230 --> 01:37:49.340
This Death, is he so dangerous?

01:37:49.550 --> 01:37:52.090
I'll go anywhere to find him.

01:37:52.140 --> 01:37:56.380
We three are brothers,
we'll avenge our friend Rufo.

01:37:56.430 --> 01:38:00.110
- We are blood brothers!
- Yes, blood brothers!

01:38:02.980 --> 01:38:04.650
Get your knives out!

01:38:06.130 --> 01:38:08.660
We must find the man
who killed our friend.

01:39:13.570 --> 01:39:15.900
God be with you, gentlemen.

01:39:16.260 --> 01:39:19.190
Who are you and why are you
dressed like a monk?

01:39:19.470 --> 01:39:20.810
Why do you look so old?

01:39:21.240 --> 01:39:25.690
Although I have travelled
the world, even to India,

01:39:26.030 --> 01:39:27.540
I have never found anyone

01:39:27.890 --> 01:39:32.830
who would change his youth
for my old age.

01:39:33.270 --> 01:39:37.070
So, poor and wretched,
I walk the world like this,

01:39:37.210 --> 01:39:40.240
and knock the ground with my staff,

01:39:41.770 --> 01:39:45.180
I knock the lap of my mother and say:

01:39:45.230 --> 01:39:50.150
"Dear mother, let me in. When
will my bones finally rest?

01:39:51.020 --> 01:39:56.110
Mother, I would give everything
for a shroud to cover me."

01:39:57.280 --> 01:40:00.000
But she will not grant that mercy.

01:40:00.921 --> 01:40:05.780
You guys, don't harm an old man,

01:40:05.830 --> 01:40:08.630
so you would not be harmed when old.

01:40:09.410 --> 01:40:13.310
Let me go and God will be
with you on your path.

01:40:13.770 --> 01:40:15.670
I have to go my way.

01:40:15.850 --> 01:40:18.580
No! You'll not get off so easily.

01:40:19.030 --> 01:40:21.810
You just talked of this traitor, Death.

01:40:21.860 --> 01:40:25.970
You are his spy, tell us where he is.
And if not, you will pay for it.

01:40:26.220 --> 01:40:28.730
You are with him to kill the young.

01:40:32.220 --> 01:40:35.590
Okay. If you want to find
what you are looking for,

01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:39.080
turn after that path, down there.

01:40:39.210 --> 01:40:43.310
What you want to find,
I have left in the forest,

01:40:43.620 --> 01:40:44.920
under a tree.

01:40:47.010 --> 01:40:51.170
See that oak? That's
where you must look.

01:40:52.110 --> 01:40:53.840
May God be with you...

01:40:54.260 --> 01:40:56.380
and make you better too.

01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:28.890
From now on we can live as rich men.

01:41:29.260 --> 01:41:34.060
But we can't take it during
daylight, we will look like thieves.

01:41:34.310 --> 01:41:37.160
One of us go and buy bread and wine.

01:41:37.560 --> 01:41:41.610
The other two will guard the treasure.
We will take it away, when it's dark.

01:41:41.880 --> 01:41:43.180
Dick is the youngest.

01:42:41.410 --> 01:42:44.790
Master Apothecary, I need
poison to kill rats and a polecat.

01:42:44.840 --> 01:42:48.380
They are eating all my chickens.
What a disaster.

01:42:49.330 --> 01:42:51.880
I have a poison so strong,

01:42:51.930 --> 01:42:56.250
that anyone who takes but a speck,
will die within a few minutes.

01:43:17.740 --> 01:43:20.010
You! Give me bread and
three bottles of wine.

01:43:20.780 --> 01:43:22.180
Hurry, run!

01:43:24.420 --> 01:43:26.120
Hurry up, bastard!

01:43:28.620 --> 01:43:32.170
Hey, I'm in a hurry. Come on!

01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:24.540
Listen very well to what
I will tell you, Johnny.

01:44:25.218 --> 01:44:26.760
We are sworn brothers.

01:44:28.360 --> 01:44:30.490
We are two against one.

01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:34.220
When he is here, you go to him
and embrace him friendly.

01:44:35.170 --> 01:44:37.680
I will take my knife,
while you hold him tight.

01:44:37.730 --> 01:44:40.320
We kill him and split
the treasure between us.

01:44:41.890 --> 01:44:43.090
Here's the wine!

01:44:43.140 --> 01:44:44.670
About time, too.

01:44:52.670 --> 01:44:54.110
Dick, my true love,

01:44:55.080 --> 01:44:57.390
I always said you
were my best friend.

01:44:59.020 --> 01:45:00.870
What a lovely arse you have.

01:45:10.340 --> 01:45:14.160
Now let's eat and drink,
then we will bury him.

01:46:09.470 --> 01:46:12.100
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

01:46:18.170 --> 01:46:20.170
What a delicious cake.

01:46:22.480 --> 01:46:24.280
Isn't it, dear Thomaso?

01:46:34.490 --> 01:46:36.130
May God reward you.

01:46:36.180 --> 01:46:40.450
On this seat I've had many
gifts and many good meals.

01:46:40.930 --> 01:46:45.330
I have heard, dear Thomaso, that you've
given things to other monks, too.

01:46:48.010 --> 01:46:49.400
That's why you are ill.

01:46:49.450 --> 01:46:53.110
Because you're unfaithful.
You gave a bag of wheat to that convent.

01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:55.630
And chickens and geese to another.

01:46:57.580 --> 01:47:01.330
No, Thomaso! This is all useless.

01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:06.670
What's the value of a farthing, cut
into pieces? It's neither warm nor cold.

01:47:07.610 --> 01:47:11.910
I can give only what I have,
nothing else, isn't it?

01:47:12.870 --> 01:47:16.190
You always tell me I'm
your brother and you love me.

01:47:17.640 --> 01:47:19.690
Yes, of course!

01:47:21.370 --> 01:47:26.190
Now I'm dying, I'll give something
to your convent too.

01:47:26.920 --> 01:47:28.690
The most precious thing I have.

01:47:29.210 --> 01:47:31.500
But on the condition to share it

01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:34.390
equally with all other monks.

01:47:34.520 --> 01:47:37.450
Well then, go down with
your hand along my back

01:47:37.500 --> 01:47:39.770
and search in the bed,
right under my arse,

01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:43.370
and you will find something
I have hidden secretly.

01:47:47.390 --> 01:47:49.020
Where? Where?

01:47:49.780 --> 01:47:52.280
Under my arse. Exactly under my arse.

01:47:53.780 --> 01:47:57.120
Is your hand there? Well then...

01:48:16.350 --> 01:48:17.720
What is it?

01:48:17.770 --> 01:48:20.530
- You must come with me.
- Where?

01:48:21.250 --> 01:48:22.840
We are going to pay a visit to hell.

01:48:24.160 --> 01:48:25.260
Why?

01:48:25.310 --> 01:48:29.770
They have decided like this.
No more questions.

01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.490
My God...

01:48:31.820 --> 01:48:32.870
Close your eyes.

01:48:33.790 --> 01:48:35.550
Keep them tight shut.

01:48:36.620 --> 01:48:38.450
One, two, three.

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:15.320
Hey, Satan!

01:49:15.370 --> 01:49:19.240
Lift your tail, show where
you keep monks in hell.

01:50:31.565 --> 01:50:35.330
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Ghost.

01:50:35.380 --> 01:50:36.880
Amen.

01:50:41.220 --> 01:50:43.420
HERE END THE CANTERBURY TALES,

01:50:43.920 --> 01:50:46.120
TOLD FOR THE PLEASURE OF TELLING.

01:50:46.720 --> 01:50:48.020
Amen.
