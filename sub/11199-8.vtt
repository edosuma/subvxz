00:04.351 --> 00:06.285
Once you walk through that door,
there is no turning back.

00:06.353 --> 00:09.379
Oh, I understand, Brian.
I'm not having any doubts.

00:09.456 --> 00:12.084
Alec, it is not just
your credibility at stake here.

00:12.159 --> 00:13.649
You're right there.

00:13.727 --> 00:16.992
It's the leaders of the democratic
free world that should be worried.

00:17.064 --> 00:19.294
Think about the people
who work for this company.

00:19.366 --> 00:22.199
- The shareholders.
- I am, Brian.

00:22.269 --> 00:26.797
They have a right to know the truth,
as does everybody else.

00:30.243 --> 00:32.177
Trust me.

00:32.245 --> 00:34.236
We're doing the right thing.

00:49.830 --> 00:52.230
Thank you all for coming.

00:54.801 --> 00:56.200
As you all know...

00:56.269 --> 01:00.365
about five months ago
our planet suffered a horrible tragedy.

01:00.440 --> 01:05.002
Over 2,000 American
servicemen and women were killed...

01:05.078 --> 01:08.241
when a meteor shower
disrupted global communications...

01:08.315 --> 01:10.909
and hit a United States
naval carrier group...

01:10.984 --> 01:13.578
on maneuvers in the Pacific Ocean.

01:14.755 --> 01:16.689
I am here today...

01:16.757 --> 01:19.692
to challenge the facts
of that incident...

01:19.760 --> 01:22.024
as they've been conveyed
to the general public.

01:25.665 --> 01:28.225
<i>On the day in question...</i>

01:28.301 --> 01:32.237
<i>none of our satellites</i>
<i>detected a meteor shower.</i>

01:32.305 --> 01:34.569
- Hey, what's going on?
- Shh, shh, shh.

01:34.641 --> 01:38.372
<i>Now, I don't know how many governments</i>
<i>around the world are in on this...</i>

01:38.445 --> 01:41.209
<i>but I do know we are being lied to...</i>

01:41.281 --> 01:45.012
<i>and the truth is being covered up.</i>

01:45.085 --> 01:46.712
Uh-oh.

01:46.787 --> 01:48.584
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:48.655 --> 01:51.852
<i>there is life beyond our world.</i>

01:52.859 --> 01:54.759
<i>There are aliens out there.</i>

01:54.828 --> 01:57.592
<i>They have a technology</i>
<i>far beyond ours...</i>

01:57.664 --> 02:02.101
<i>and they have been intervening</i>
<i>in our existence for quite some time.</i>

02:04.004 --> 02:06.564
<i>I have proof...</i>

02:06.640 --> 02:09.040
<i>and I am giving the governments...</i>

02:09.109 --> 02:12.044
<i>of all the nations</i>
<i>that are aware of this...</i>

02:12.112 --> 02:15.604
<i>24 hours to reveal the truth...</i>

02:19.119 --> 02:21.314
<i>or I'm gonna do it for them.</i>

02:21.388 --> 02:22.878
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:25.492 --> 02:26.823
Well...

02:27.928 --> 02:29.327
there you go.

03:35.161 --> 03:38.460
<i>For those of you living on</i>
<i>another planet for the past 20 years...</i>

03:38.532 --> 03:40.966
<i>Alec Colson, age 42...</i>

03:41.034 --> 03:43.525
<i>net worth over $60 billion...</i>

03:43.603 --> 03:45.537
<i>runs a global empire of companies...</i>

03:45.605 --> 03:50.668
<i>including communications, biotechnology,</i>
<i>aerospace and aviation.</i>

03:50.744 --> 03:53.372
<i>He's number eight on the</i> Fortune <i>500.</i>

03:53.446 --> 03:55.914
<i>He personally holds</i>
<i>over 200 proprietary patents-</i>

03:55.982 --> 03:58.382
Shut it off!

03:59.619 --> 04:02.349
We know who he is.

04:02.422 --> 04:04.549
Some of us better than others.

04:04.624 --> 04:06.888
We worked together briefly, sir.

04:06.960 --> 04:11.056
Colson Aviation developed the multi-engine
control systems for the F-302s.

04:11.765 --> 04:15.565
Colson didn't know what they were for,
of course, but he is a brilliant engineer.

04:15.635 --> 04:17.603
He's also a little nuts, isn't he?

04:18.204 --> 04:20.263
You've test-flown
experimental aircraft.

04:20.340 --> 04:22.604
We all go through the gate.

04:22.676 --> 04:26.077
- This isn't about us.
- Well, in a way it is.

04:26.146 --> 04:29.638
The point is, sir,
he's not some loony cult leader.

04:29.716 --> 04:31.308
People are taking him seriously.

04:32.819 --> 04:35.219
So, what do we think he knows?

04:35.288 --> 04:38.621
He owns several Earth
observer and weather satellites.

04:38.692 --> 04:40.956
Maybe it's possible
they picked something up-

04:41.027 --> 04:43.587
pictures of Anubis's fleet in orbit,
or the battle over Antarctica?

04:44.364 --> 04:47.492
What I don't understand is,
how could it have come this far?

04:47.567 --> 04:50.730
He's gotten the national security speech
from the Pentagon several times.

04:50.804 --> 04:53.932
Apparently the president
has called him personally.

04:54.007 --> 04:56.567
Why not merely tell him the truth?

04:56.643 --> 05:01.080
His personality was profiled
and he was deemed a "security risk."

05:01.147 --> 05:02.637
For obvious reasons.

05:02.716 --> 05:06.777
His father was a newspaper reporter
who was jailed during the McCarthy era.

05:06.853 --> 05:10.755
He believes in freedom of speech and the
right to know what the government's doing.

05:11.291 --> 05:14.192
Leaking classified information
could be considered treason.

05:16.630 --> 05:19.758
All right, see if he can be
convinced not to go public.

05:21.534 --> 05:23.331
Without actually telling him anything?

05:23.937 --> 05:25.097
Right.

05:30.443 --> 05:32.434
<i>We've got all the major networks...</i>

05:32.512 --> 05:34.446
over a dozen live radio broadcasts...

05:34.514 --> 05:36.778
and reporters from newspapers,
both legit and tabloids...

05:36.850 --> 05:38.784
all waiting for the next shoe to drop.

05:38.852 --> 05:42.447
- Brian, calm down.
- Our stock price is trading down 25%.

05:42.522 --> 05:45.616
We overextended ourselves competing
for that last round of contracts.

05:45.692 --> 05:48.456
That stock price is the only thing
covering our debt...

05:48.528 --> 05:51.793
and you are alienating
our biggest client.

05:51.865 --> 05:53.594
We're gonna have to start
selling off assets.

05:53.667 --> 05:56.465
What does that matter, Brian...

05:56.536 --> 05:58.834
given what we know?

05:58.905 --> 06:02.397
I don't know. I guess I'm just trying
to hold on to some shred of reality.

06:02.475 --> 06:05.035
Well, you, along with everyone else...

06:05.111 --> 06:08.842
are gonna have to start dealing with
a whole new reality from now on.

06:09.849 --> 06:11.908
What if the world can't handle it?

06:11.985 --> 06:15.148
What if Washington's right and we
should just keep this thing in the bag?

06:15.221 --> 06:17.189
Trust me.
The truth is always right.

06:18.792 --> 06:20.350
We've already caused mass hysteria.

06:21.795 --> 06:23.763
You have no idea
how much chaos this could cause.

06:25.799 --> 06:28.063
- They're here.
- Show them in, would you?

06:30.403 --> 06:32.837
It'll be okay.

06:33.807 --> 06:36.105
- Lieutenant Colonel.
- Alec.

06:36.176 --> 06:37.541
Radiant as ever.

06:38.645 --> 06:39.873
- DanielJackson.
- Oh! Doc.

06:39.946 --> 06:42.210
- I'm a big fan.
- Really?

06:42.282 --> 06:44.842
Yes. I've been following you
since your early career.

06:44.918 --> 06:48.649
Pyramids as landing pads
for alien ships? Fascinating.

06:48.722 --> 06:50.713
That was a long time ago.

06:50.790 --> 06:54.226
What have you been up to since?
It's like you just dropped off the map.

06:54.294 --> 06:55.727
I've been around.

06:57.964 --> 07:00.899
I beg your pardon.
May I introduce Brian Vogler.

07:01.601 --> 07:03.694
Thank you for seeing us today.

07:03.770 --> 07:05.863
Well, shall we?

07:05.939 --> 07:09.568
Why don't we start with something
I'm sure we can all agree on. Hmm?

07:10.677 --> 07:13.077
That meteor shower
was a cover story.

07:13.146 --> 07:15.706
And a surprisingly weak one at that.

07:15.782 --> 07:19.616
Although, under the circumstances, I'm not
sure I'd have come up with a better one.

07:20.253 --> 07:21.618
What makes you say that?

07:41.508 --> 07:44.136
I'm guessing that's one of ours.

07:44.210 --> 07:47.737
We lost contact with 1 <i>2 communications
and weather mapping satellites...</i>

07:47.814 --> 07:49.805
for over six hours
on the day in question.

07:51.050 --> 07:53.746
When we got them back, they were able
to transmit images stored in the buffers.

07:54.821 --> 07:56.812
Images like these can be faked.

07:56.890 --> 07:58.983
Or made to seem fake.

08:04.531 --> 08:06.590
I know why you're here, Sam.

08:06.666 --> 08:08.224
The Pentagon wants me to know...

08:08.301 --> 08:11.862
that people like you are gonna be
trying to make me look like a fraud.

08:11.938 --> 08:15.032
- People like me?
- Very smart people.

08:15.108 --> 08:17.133
Oh, we have more than this.

08:18.044 --> 08:20.444
Now, obviously,
I don't know everything...

08:20.513 --> 08:23.448
but I do have a right to,
as does everyone else.

08:25.218 --> 08:27.152
Anything we can say to stop you?

08:27.220 --> 08:28.881
Believe me, I've tried.

08:37.964 --> 08:39.829
Sam, it's Julia Donovan.

08:40.834 --> 08:42.768
How did you get this number?

08:42.836 --> 08:44.167
<i>I have my sources.</i>

08:44.904 --> 08:47.532
Our camera truck just caught you
and a nice-looking young man...

08:47.607 --> 08:50.440
going into Colson Industries'
head office in Seattle an hour ago.

08:50.510 --> 08:52.000
I just saw the feed.

08:52.078 --> 08:53.375
And?

08:53.446 --> 08:55.437
<i>Just wondering if you had</i>
<i>an official comment.</i>

08:55.515 --> 08:59.042
- Yeah. I think your coverage is one-sided.
- <i>Come on, Sam.</i>

08:59.118 --> 09:01.416
Colson's gonna out
the whole operation.

09:01.487 --> 09:03.785
You don't really think
Washington can contain this.

09:03.857 --> 09:04.881
<i>We'll see.</i>

09:04.958 --> 09:08.416
Look, I don't have to remind you about the
nondisclosure agreement you signed, do I?

09:08.494 --> 09:11.088
It's a reporter from
the <i>Prometheus</i> incident.

09:11.731 --> 09:14.165
Colson doesn't seem
to be worried about going to jail.

09:14.667 --> 09:17.431
Yeah, well, he hasn't
done anything illegal yet.

09:17.503 --> 09:19.027
<i>We had an agreement.</i>

09:19.105 --> 09:22.097
<i>You said that if something big</i>
<i>was gonna break, you would call me first.</i>

09:22.175 --> 09:24.541
I will. Okay? Bye-bye.

09:25.612 --> 09:28.206
I got 13 messages
from Emmett Bregman.

09:31.317 --> 09:34.252
The switchboard's been jammed
ever since the press conference.

09:34.287 --> 09:35.845
Every crackpot in the world is calling.

09:35.922 --> 09:38.720
I've arranged security for all of you
and your families.

09:38.791 --> 09:40.725
Do you really think
we need to be worried?

09:40.793 --> 09:42.727
I'd be more worried about the things
we don't know at this point.

09:42.795 --> 09:44.990
I'm trying to convince him
it's not too late.

09:45.064 --> 09:47.259
It is too late, Brian.

09:47.333 --> 09:50.791
Too late for the world to know there
was an alien attack against our planet...

09:50.870 --> 09:53.202
which was barely thwarted...

09:53.273 --> 09:55.207
too late for the general public
to realize they've been lied to...

09:55.275 --> 09:59.712
by two different elected administrations
about the very nature of our existence.

09:59.779 --> 10:02.407
- So we're going public?
- I was hoping the feds would come clean.

10:02.482 --> 10:06.316
I can't believe Washington hasn't done
more to stop us, some legal injunction.

10:06.386 --> 10:08.911
That would legitimize our claims.

10:08.988 --> 10:12.822
No, they're obviously going to try to play
this as if we can't be taken seriously.

10:12.892 --> 10:14.826
We're one of the largest
corporations in the world.

10:14.894 --> 10:16.384
And we're telling the truth.

10:16.462 --> 10:20.398
Alec, it doesn't matter
who we are or how right we are.

10:20.466 --> 10:23.799
- They can stop us if they really want to.
- Come on, Brian.

10:23.870 --> 10:26.430
What are they gonna do? Hmm?

10:27.440 --> 10:28.964
Have me killed?

10:34.080 --> 10:37.277
He's gotta have something
more significant than pictures.

10:37.350 --> 10:40.751
I'm going over government contracts
assigned to Colson's companies.

10:40.820 --> 10:43.653
I haven't gone through them all,
but there's quite a few loosely related...

10:43.723 --> 10:47.352
to R&D of alien technologies
that we procured off-world.

10:49.429 --> 10:51.761
<i>We'll now head to Colson Industries.</i>

10:53.933 --> 10:55.867
<i>Welcome.</i>

10:55.935 --> 10:59.029
- <i>Thank you for coming.</i>
- Twenty-four hours, to the minute.

10:59.105 --> 11:01.539
Yesterday, I told you of our belief...

11:01.607 --> 11:03.700
in the existence of intelligent life...

11:03.776 --> 11:05.505
beyond our planet.

11:06.512 --> 11:07.809
I also told you...

11:07.880 --> 11:11.111
that we believe several governments,
including our own...

11:11.184 --> 11:12.811
have known about this...

11:12.885 --> 11:15.979
and have been concealing
the information for quite some time now.

11:17.123 --> 11:19.990
Yesterday, I challenged
those governments...

11:20.059 --> 11:23.028
to come clean,
reveal the truth.

11:25.765 --> 11:27.756
We got only silence.

11:29.769 --> 11:32.237
Which gives me no choice...

11:32.305 --> 11:35.297
but to present to you...

11:36.609 --> 11:38.804
what evidence I have.

11:40.747 --> 11:44.911
How do I know for sure
that alien life really does exist?

11:47.520 --> 11:49.920
Ladies and gentlemen...

11:49.989 --> 11:51.820
seeing is believing.

12:20.987 --> 12:22.352
Well, I'd call that something.

12:30.363 --> 12:31.728
The world is in a frenzy...

12:31.798 --> 12:36.462
after yesterday's startling revelation
of what appeared to be a live alien...

12:36.536 --> 12:39.004
by billionaire industrialist
Alec Colson.

12:39.072 --> 12:42.007
Thus far there's been no official
statement from the White House...

12:42.075 --> 12:44.475
and sources inside Colson Industries...

12:44.544 --> 12:46.705
promise that there is
definitely more to come.

12:46.779 --> 12:48.770
Okay. Thank you, Sergeant.

12:49.982 --> 12:52.917
Well, we just got a message back
from Thor.

12:52.985 --> 12:56.386
As far as he knows,
there are no Asgard currently on Earth.

12:56.456 --> 12:58.583
Loki was here for years
conducting experiments...

12:58.658 --> 13:01.491
without the high council
knowing about it.

13:01.561 --> 13:03.392
Okay, here's a possibility.

13:04.664 --> 13:08.156
What if it wasn't really an Asgard?

13:10.336 --> 13:11.963
- Looked like one.
- Didn't sound like one.

13:12.038 --> 13:13.562
- Didn't say anything.
- That's my point.

13:14.107 --> 13:16.837
Colson wrapped things up pretty quickly
without taking any questions.

13:16.909 --> 13:18.171
It was a perfect likeness.

13:19.479 --> 13:22.846
Imagery of little gray aliens
has been commonplace on Earth for years.

13:22.915 --> 13:26.442
- Colson could have a picture.
- So, not a real Asgard?

13:27.120 --> 13:29.782
No Asgard we know would allow himself
to be used that way.

13:29.856 --> 13:31.790
It did look a little vacant.

13:33.192 --> 13:35.854
Still, as much
as he wants the whole truth...

13:35.928 --> 13:38.488
I don't think Colson
would perpetrate a hoax to get it.

13:38.564 --> 13:40.156
Then what was it?

13:41.868 --> 13:43.358
I don't know.

13:43.436 --> 13:45.666
The networks all want interviews.

13:45.738 --> 13:47.603
Too bad our friend can't talk.

13:47.673 --> 13:51.370
Well, we know he's capable. The MRIs
show a larynx not too different from ours.

13:51.444 --> 13:53.378
But he doesn't seem
to have anything to say.

13:53.446 --> 13:56.882
They also want full access for independent
medical and scientific personnel...

13:56.949 --> 13:59.042
to verify that it's
really what we say it is.

13:59.118 --> 14:01.712
How are we supposed to convince
the world of alien intelligence...

14:01.787 --> 14:03.414
when this guy
doesn't seem to have any?

14:03.489 --> 14:08.324
We can't trot this thing out on TVwith
claims we aren't gonna be able to back up.

14:08.394 --> 14:10.828
Granted, it's an amazing
genetic experiment.

14:10.897 --> 14:13.092
But we don't even know
that the thing is really alien.

14:13.166 --> 14:14.428
What else could it be?

14:14.500 --> 14:17.333
All we know is that the DNA
came from the Department of Defense.

14:17.403 --> 14:20.804
Look, we're trying to build
a circumstantial case here.

14:20.873 --> 14:22.340
The more questions we can raise...

14:22.408 --> 14:25.343
the more the burden of proof
is gonna shift to Washington.

14:25.411 --> 14:28.346
Sooner or later they're gonna have
to respond to the public pressure.

14:28.414 --> 14:30.348
Meanwhile, we stay quiet.

14:30.416 --> 14:33.351
The media's going nuts
over this whole thing...

14:33.419 --> 14:36.354
so let's just sit tight...

14:36.422 --> 14:38.413
and see what happens.

14:41.928 --> 14:45.921
Well, Sam was right. There's something
different about Colson's Asgard.

14:49.068 --> 14:52.367
Seems that a Colson
biotech research company...

14:52.438 --> 14:55.032
was given a copy
of Asgard DNA for sequencing.

14:55.107 --> 14:57.075
We were trying to help
with their cloning problem.

14:57.143 --> 14:59.407
Colson grew a clone?

15:00.479 --> 15:03.846
They weren't told it was alien DNA.
It was meant to be a blind study.

15:03.916 --> 15:07.352
But they obviously took their research
further than the contract specified.

15:08.354 --> 15:12.120
Asgard DNA is programmed to grow
a clone to maturity in just three months.

15:12.191 --> 15:13.783
But they're essentially an empty shell...

15:13.859 --> 15:16.191
until an existing consciousness
can be transferred into them.

15:16.262 --> 15:18.730
It did not speak
because it was not capable.

15:18.798 --> 15:23.167
Exactly. They probably spent what time
they had with it teaching it how to walk.

15:24.403 --> 15:25.893
Well...

15:26.906 --> 15:28.601
the Pentagon has lost all patience.

15:29.442 --> 15:32.206
- What are they gonna do?
- They want us to put a stop to it.

15:32.278 --> 15:33.472
How?

15:34.680 --> 15:36.978
We're calling in a marker.

15:46.626 --> 15:49.618
Yep.
Callin' in a marker.

15:55.434 --> 15:56.765
Greetings.

16:00.273 --> 16:01.570
Excuse me.

16:02.575 --> 16:04.133
It's gone.

16:04.210 --> 16:07.077
- What do you mean?
- Just disappeared right out of the lab.

16:07.146 --> 16:09.614
The alien!
Computers, everything.

16:09.682 --> 16:11.047
How?
What about security?

16:11.117 --> 16:13.677
Nobody took it.
It disappeared.

16:13.753 --> 16:15.846
We were standing right there,
there was a bright flash of light...

16:15.921 --> 16:17.183
and it was all just gone.

16:17.256 --> 16:21.192
Have Ron send out the decoy car, and get
the plane ready for a trip to Washington.

16:21.260 --> 16:24.320
Have it ready by the time
I get to the hangar.

16:26.832 --> 16:28.197
You ready?

16:28.267 --> 16:30.531
- Not really.
- Just try not to think about the camera.

16:30.603 --> 16:33.401
- Focus on me.
- It's not that.

16:33.472 --> 16:35.497
I respect Alec Colson.

16:35.574 --> 16:40.034
I don't like being asked to discredit a
man who has every right to want the truth.

16:40.112 --> 16:42.137
- But you've been ordered to do this.
- Yeah.

16:42.214 --> 16:45.945
Well, if you want to go against
those orders, feel free. I'll go with it.

16:48.954 --> 16:53.015
In five, four, three, two-

16:55.227 --> 16:59.891
We're here with Lt. Col. Samantha Carter
of the United States Air Force.

16:59.965 --> 17:01.762
- Welcome.
- Thank you.

17:01.834 --> 17:03.301
Your background is astrophysics...

17:03.369 --> 17:06.532
and you're one of the military's
leading scientific researchers.

17:07.173 --> 17:10.370
We're all very eager to finally hear
some reaction from Washington...

17:10.443 --> 17:13.173
regarding the revelation
made by Alec Colson.

17:13.245 --> 17:15.543
Well, first of all
I can assure people...

17:15.614 --> 17:20.881
if aliens really existed and were visiting
the planet, we would know about it.

17:21.854 --> 17:24.880
So, are you saying
his claims have no merit?

17:24.957 --> 17:27.755
We all saw an alien
on live television.

17:27.827 --> 17:31.923
Yes, well, Hollywood's been helping us
see things on TV for a long time now.

17:32.665 --> 17:35.657
<i>Are you saying</i>
<i>that the alien wasn't real?</i>

17:35.735 --> 17:37.532
<i>It depends on</i>
<i>what you mean by "real. '"</i>

17:38.504 --> 17:40.938
Notice she hasn't actually lied once.

17:41.006 --> 17:42.337
<i>I can show you...</i>

17:42.408 --> 17:45.866
advanced methods for creating realistic
3-D images that we've been working on.

17:45.945 --> 17:46.934
By all means.

17:48.180 --> 17:49.943
We've been experimenting
with technology...

17:50.015 --> 17:54.850
that makes it possible for us to create
anything you can imagine virtually.

18:01.861 --> 18:05.456
<i>Wow. That looks just like the alien</i>
<i>Alec Colson introduced to us.</i>

18:06.832 --> 18:09.130
<i>Greetings, people of Earth.</i>

18:10.703 --> 18:12.500
That's amazing.
He looks so real.

18:12.571 --> 18:13.731
Though I look real...

18:13.806 --> 18:18.539
I have been created through the use
of advanced holographic technology.

18:22.281 --> 18:24.112
That's just incredible.

18:26.519 --> 18:28.043
It's just a projection.

18:28.120 --> 18:31.612
You'll probably be seeing technology like
this in theme park rides in a few years.

18:33.692 --> 18:34.920
She's good.

18:39.265 --> 18:42.928
Not quite the exclusive I had in mind,
but it'll still do huge numbers.

18:43.002 --> 18:44.094
You're hilarious.

18:44.170 --> 18:47.196
After everything you've been through,
you still care about ratings.

18:47.273 --> 18:49.503
How did you do it?

18:49.575 --> 18:51.509
I've seen visual effects before, Sam.

18:51.577 --> 18:53.545
I mean, this was some sort of-

18:54.547 --> 18:56.777
this was some sort
of alien technology, wasn't it?

19:03.622 --> 19:04.816
What is it?

19:04.890 --> 19:07.324
"Ten minutes ago,
Alec Colson's private plane...

19:07.393 --> 19:09.327
was forced into
an emergency landing...

19:09.395 --> 19:12.364
after almost crashing
on take-off from SeaTac.

19:12.431 --> 19:15.730
The plane suffered sudden depressurization
and loss of engine power...

19:15.801 --> 19:17.792
but was able to land
without serious incident."

19:18.537 --> 19:20.698
Excuse me, Sam.
I've gotta go to the air with this.

19:20.773 --> 19:23.037
I need something on Colson's wife
and his daughter.

19:23.108 --> 19:25.508
They died in a plane crash
when he was <i>2 4.</i>

19:25.578 --> 19:28.012
That's why he started
Colson Aviation.

19:28.080 --> 19:29.570
Let's go.

19:33.853 --> 19:35.343
It's Alec Colson.

19:38.858 --> 19:41.850
- Are you okay?
- <i>News travels fast.</i>

19:42.595 --> 19:45.860
It was close.
Brian's still as white as a sheet.

19:46.799 --> 19:50.132
- How did you get this number?
- <i>Oh, I have my sources.</i>

19:50.202 --> 19:53.797
The ground crew here found evidence
the plane had been tampered with.

19:53.873 --> 19:56.569
- Someone tried to kill you?
- <i>Seems that way.</i>

19:57.142 --> 19:58.507
Any ideas?

19:59.445 --> 20:01.436
You think I know?

20:01.514 --> 20:05.507
Why would I go on TV to discredit you if
I knew you were about to be assassinated?

20:05.584 --> 20:08.417
To make sure it didn't look like
Washington had anything to do with it.

20:08.487 --> 20:11.820
<i>And a finejob you did, too,</i>
<i>by the way.</i>

20:11.891 --> 20:14.758
- I'm sorry. I was following orders.
- <i>Yeah, I know.</i>

20:14.827 --> 20:18.923
Don't worry, Sam. I don't believe
for a second you were in on it.

20:18.998 --> 20:21.660
If it was our government,
I'm sure you were just a pawn.

20:22.668 --> 20:24.966
That doesn't make me
feel any better.

20:25.037 --> 20:27.665
- Look, Alec, I can assure you-
- <i>It's okay.</i>

20:27.740 --> 20:31.506
It wasn't my first rough landing.
I'm sure it won't be my last.

20:31.577 --> 20:33.772
I won't be stopped, Sam.

20:33.846 --> 20:36.371
I promise you,
one way or another...

20:36.448 --> 20:38.916
the world is going to learn the truth.

20:48.227 --> 20:50.787
How about a hyperdrive
for the <i>Prometheus?</i>

20:50.863 --> 20:54.355
That is something
I must discuss with the high council.

20:54.433 --> 20:56.094
Thor, come on.

20:56.168 --> 20:59.103
You said you wanted
to get something nice for the president.

21:06.011 --> 21:08.707
Sir, anything on who might've
tried to kill Colson?

21:08.781 --> 21:10.874
It wasn't us.

21:10.950 --> 21:13.145
We think that Colson
may have fragments...

21:13.218 --> 21:15.152
of downed Goa'uld ships
recovered from the Antarctic.

21:15.220 --> 21:17.586
A subsidiary of his was involved
in the salvage and the cleanup.

21:18.324 --> 21:20.758
Are we just going to keep trying
to discredit the man?

21:21.660 --> 21:24.151
I mean, aren't we the ones
a little delusional...

21:24.229 --> 21:27.221
to think that we could cover up
an attack of this scale?

21:27.299 --> 21:30.632
- What's the alternative?
- How about tell the truth?

21:34.006 --> 21:35.803
I mean to Colson.

21:35.874 --> 21:39.810
I know he's been deemed a security risk.
Obviously that's an accurate assessment.

21:39.878 --> 21:44.679
But what have we got to lose at this
point? He's already trying to go public.

21:44.750 --> 21:47.981
Let's show him why it's so important
to keep the secret.

21:48.821 --> 21:52.587
Besides, think of the benefits of having
a man with his resources on our side.

21:56.295 --> 21:59.856
Well, Thor and I are meeting
with the president in five minutes.

21:59.932 --> 22:01.263
I'll bring it up.

22:01.333 --> 22:04.268
- Five minutes?
- Oh, yeah.

22:10.409 --> 22:11.967
Right.

22:15.748 --> 22:18.012
<i>2:00 we go live...</i>

22:18.083 --> 22:21.109
with the pictures, pieces of the
alien ship, everything we've got.

22:21.186 --> 22:24.622
Alec, they tried to kill us.

22:25.190 --> 22:27.920
You think that didn't work
in our favor?

22:27.993 --> 22:30.154
Dying doesn't work in our favor!

22:41.006 --> 22:44.271
Okay, what just happened?

22:44.343 --> 22:48.643
Well, in layman's terms,
we beamed you up... and then down again.

22:48.714 --> 22:50.011
Where am I?

22:50.082 --> 22:52.880
Cheyenne Mountain Complex,
Colorado.

22:52.951 --> 22:55.545
- You know Daniel, of course.
- Yeah. Hi.

22:56.155 --> 22:58.316
And this is Thor.

22:58.390 --> 22:59.823
Greetings.

23:00.592 --> 23:03.026
Ah, so this is a real one.

23:03.095 --> 23:06.394
- Yep.
- Well, what happened to the clone?

23:06.465 --> 23:09.059
It will become a host
to an Asgard consciousness...

23:09.134 --> 23:11.159
whose physical body is failing.

23:12.237 --> 23:14.171
Okay.

23:14.239 --> 23:16.366
Now I must take my leave.

23:16.442 --> 23:19.206
General O'Neill said
he will see you all tomorrow.

23:27.252 --> 23:29.243
I want to show you something.

23:43.802 --> 23:45.793
We call it a Stargate.

23:48.207 --> 23:49.868
I'm okay, Brian.

23:49.942 --> 23:52.137
I promise you, I'm fine.

23:52.211 --> 23:54.338
I'll be back in a couple of days.

23:54.413 --> 23:55.607
I've got to go.

23:55.681 --> 23:57.979
- All right. Bye.
- Ready?

23:58.050 --> 24:00.245
Whoa.
Look at you.

24:00.319 --> 24:02.753
Yeah. Soldier Sam.

24:03.722 --> 24:05.622
Oh, I get a uniform too?

24:05.691 --> 24:06.749
Yep.

24:08.160 --> 24:10.560
All right.

24:33.619 --> 24:36.611
So, where are we going?

24:36.688 --> 24:39.623
P4X-650.
We have an off-world base there.

24:40.626 --> 24:42.560
And how far away is that?

24:42.628 --> 24:44.619
640 light-years.

24:45.798 --> 24:48.392
- Really?
- Let's go.

25:03.582 --> 25:05.277
Didn't feel a thing.

25:05.350 --> 25:07.341
You were demolecularized.

25:09.254 --> 25:11.347
Welcome to the Alpha Site.

25:11.423 --> 25:13.789
Alec Colson, Captain Shefield.

25:16.428 --> 25:19.363
Well, it's- it's nice.

25:19.431 --> 25:22.366
Our last Alpha Site
was destroyed in an attack.

25:22.434 --> 25:25.699
We decided to build this one
inside a mountain like the SGC.

25:25.771 --> 25:29.366
The conditions are a bit spartan,
but it's our home away from home.

25:29.441 --> 25:35.380
I guess I was just expecting something
a little more, I don't know, otherworldly.

25:46.391 --> 25:49.155
Now, that-
that's more like it.

25:50.462 --> 25:53.829
It's called the <i>F-302.</i>
Alien-human hybrid.

25:56.201 --> 25:58.226
So this is what the MECs were for.

25:58.971 --> 26:03.408
Thanks to you, it's capable of leaving
the atmosphere and returning.

26:03.475 --> 26:06.444
We used a number of these
to defend Earth five months ago.

26:06.511 --> 26:08.445
This is just one of the many
advancements we've made...

26:08.513 --> 26:12.244
as a result of technology
procured through the Stargate.

26:13.252 --> 26:14.685
You want to take a ride?

26:31.103 --> 26:32.832
Brian, what are you doing?

26:32.905 --> 26:35.533
Alec wants all the evidence
that we have about the alien cover-up...

26:35.607 --> 26:37.541
duplicated and secured
off premises.

26:38.777 --> 26:42.474
You can get started on whatever
we have left on the clone research.

26:59.598 --> 27:02.032
I told you.
I don't know where he is.

27:04.069 --> 27:07.596
I have a meeting with the SEC
this afternoon.

27:07.673 --> 27:09.072
I understand.

27:10.575 --> 27:13.203
Don't worry.

27:13.278 --> 27:14.768
It'll work.

27:33.465 --> 27:36.298
- Beautiful.
- Yeah.

27:36.368 --> 27:39.166
Must be hard,
keeping all this secret.

27:39.237 --> 27:41.171
I don't know how you do it.

27:41.239 --> 27:44.174
I think of all the fear it would cause,
the potential chaos.

27:45.277 --> 27:48.474
But what about all the greater meaning
you could bring to people's lives...

27:48.547 --> 27:51.778
just knowing that all of this
is- is out here?

27:51.850 --> 27:55.786
What's "out here" is a enemy
so advanced, so evil...

27:55.854 --> 27:58.982
it's a miracle we haven't been
wiped out or enslaved yet.

27:59.558 --> 28:01.150
We've been very lucky so far.

28:01.893 --> 28:03.588
I think most people
would have a hard time...

28:03.662 --> 28:05.892
living with the threat
of constant, impending doom.

28:05.964 --> 28:07.226
Oh, right.

28:07.299 --> 28:09.597
The old "if you had cancer" argument.

28:09.668 --> 28:11.898
Would you want to know
you were going to die...

28:11.970 --> 28:14.905
or would you rather live out
your final days in blissful ignorance?

28:14.973 --> 28:17.806
Yeah, I guess I don't
really buy it either.

28:17.876 --> 28:20.811
Well, I'd rather know,
try to cure it...

28:20.879 --> 28:25.543
and if I couldn't, then I'd try to make
my final days as meaningful as possible.

28:27.819 --> 28:29.309
You want a turn?

28:30.722 --> 28:32.713
I thought I was
going to have to ask.

28:33.458 --> 28:37.326
Switching to copilot control.
Go ahead. She's all yours.

28:45.904 --> 28:48.668
- So, what do you think?
- Amazing!

28:48.740 --> 28:53.643
She maneuvers like an <i>FA-22</i>
and feels like a 747.

28:53.712 --> 28:55.111
That's the inertial dampeners.

28:55.781 --> 28:57.578
All right, let's try this.

29:11.129 --> 29:13.359
Alec, pull up!

29:27.212 --> 29:30.511
Flight, this is Alpha Command.
Is everything okay up there?

29:30.582 --> 29:33.574
It is now. We're fine.
Bringing her back in.

29:55.607 --> 29:57.097
Well, that was reckless.

29:57.175 --> 30:00.076
The <i>302</i> can handle it.

30:00.145 --> 30:01.373
I know.

30:01.446 --> 30:05.883
I may not have known its name,
but I helped you build it. Remember?

30:05.951 --> 30:09.944
It was a joyride.
I took you up for a little fun.

30:11.022 --> 30:12.956
This isn't a game, Sam.

30:13.024 --> 30:17.188
What you guys are doing up here?
This is life and death for all of us.

30:17.262 --> 30:18.820
We know that.

30:19.698 --> 30:22.496
It wasn't much fun feeling
out of control like that, was it?

30:22.567 --> 30:25.331
You don't have to
make your point with my life.

30:25.403 --> 30:29.032
Oh, come on.
We were never going to crash.

30:29.107 --> 30:31.041
Unlike my plane back on Earth.

30:31.943 --> 30:33.706
I told you.
We had nothing to do with it.

30:34.779 --> 30:36.747
Yeah, well, someone did.

30:36.815 --> 30:38.749
And if you think that...

30:38.817 --> 30:41.149
or any of this...

30:41.219 --> 30:44.154
is going to prevent me from telling the
world what they have a right to know...

30:45.857 --> 30:48.325
well, you're dead wrong.

30:56.134 --> 30:59.126
Alec, there's something else
I need to talk to you about.

31:01.306 --> 31:04.173
There's a clandestine group
of private businessmen like yourself...

31:04.242 --> 31:07.177
who were informed of the Stargate
program over six years ago...

31:07.245 --> 31:09.179
by rogue elements of the NI D.

31:09.247 --> 31:13.274
We've tried to identify them, bring them
down, but they are very highly connected.

31:13.351 --> 31:16.411
Former Vice President Kinsey
has been linked to them.

31:16.488 --> 31:19.048
Now, instead of going public,
like you...

31:19.124 --> 31:21.183
they've been funding
various secret endeavors...

31:21.259 --> 31:24.194
all aimed at controlling alien technology
for their own purposes.

31:24.996 --> 31:27.931
- Which are?
- You'd have to ask them.

31:28.567 --> 31:31.434
Personal profit, or maybe they think
they can do a better job...

31:31.503 --> 31:34.131
of defending the planet
than we can.

31:34.206 --> 31:35.571
Why are you telling me all this?

31:36.908 --> 31:39.001
Because I'm guessing
that's who tried to kill you.

31:41.112 --> 31:44.275
They'll never get control of the gate
if the world finds out.

31:47.652 --> 31:51.679
When I was young,
all I ever dreamed about was flying.

31:51.756 --> 31:57.217
I had every make of aeroplane
ever built hanging from my ceiling.

31:57.295 --> 32:01.322
And then-Well, I take it you know
about my wife and daughter.

32:02.434 --> 32:04.368
One of the downsides of celebrity.

32:04.436 --> 32:07.132
We really do have no secrets.

32:07.205 --> 32:08.672
Anyway, after the crash...

32:08.740 --> 32:12.107
I vowed to make flying
as safe as it possibly could be.

32:12.777 --> 32:15.302
I really thought that I could do it
better than anyone else.

32:15.380 --> 32:17.405
But you have made a difference.

32:18.416 --> 32:20.509
But nothing's perfect, is it?

32:23.421 --> 32:25.616
Intergalactic travel...

32:25.690 --> 32:29.091
advanced alien civilizations,
humans living on other worlds.

32:31.363 --> 32:34.423
I do realize that there may be
bad guys out there too.

32:34.499 --> 32:37.093
You have no idea how bad.

32:37.168 --> 32:42.105
But in the end,
we have to believe in humanity.

32:42.173 --> 32:45.404
I mean, who knows? This might
bring us all together as a planet.

32:46.678 --> 32:50.011
If we knew it would play out
that way, then-

32:50.915 --> 32:52.849
You're afraid that
knowing about the Stargate...

32:52.917 --> 32:55.010
would fracture the world
more than it already is.

32:55.086 --> 32:56.348
Yeah.

32:56.421 --> 33:00.016
Not just stop us fighting the Goa'uld,
but end things for good.

33:00.091 --> 33:02.355
We've seen it happen
on other planets like Earth.

33:02.427 --> 33:06.193
In one case, public revelation of the
Stargate caused an apocalyptic world war.

33:07.232 --> 33:10.258
Oh, that would be the ultimate irony,
wouldn't it?

33:10.335 --> 33:12.496
You secretly save the world
from destruction...

33:12.570 --> 33:14.197
at the hands of alien invaders...

33:14.272 --> 33:18.538
only for us to destroy ourselves
out of fear, after the fact.

33:20.345 --> 33:21.869
Change your mind?

33:22.781 --> 33:23.770
Not really.

33:26.618 --> 33:28.210
I don't think it would happen.

33:29.654 --> 33:33.954
And if a truth of this magnitude...

33:34.025 --> 33:36.289
about the very nature
of human existence...

33:36.361 --> 33:38.522
could lead us to destroy ourselves...

33:40.498 --> 33:42.864
then I'd say we would deserve it,
wouldn't you?

33:48.740 --> 33:52.039
<i>Investigators now believe</i>
<i>that Alec Colson created the alien hoax...</i>

33:52.110 --> 33:56.240
<i>in order to divert attention from</i>
<i>his real corporate financial problems.</i>

33:56.314 --> 33:58.646
<i>Colson, who has still made</i>
<i>no public statement-</i>

33:59.784 --> 34:02.651
Corporate financial problems?

34:02.721 --> 34:03.983
What is she talking about?

34:04.823 --> 34:07.053
The story broke about an hour ago.

34:07.125 --> 34:09.059
The president's
halted trading on the markets.

34:09.627 --> 34:13.563
Your company's stock had fallen 80%,
and the Dow was down over 500 points.

34:15.400 --> 34:16.560
What's going on?

34:17.135 --> 34:19.899
The SEC is investigating you
for securities fraud.

34:21.906 --> 34:23.533
That's ridiculous.

34:23.608 --> 34:25.041
They're saying there are irregularities...

34:25.110 --> 34:27.078
in your company's
last two financial statements.

34:27.812 --> 34:29.541
Why, it's not true.

34:31.182 --> 34:32.649
Come on!

34:33.952 --> 34:35.783
The timing of this-

34:38.623 --> 34:40.682
I'm being set up.

34:56.307 --> 34:57.797
What's she doing here?

34:59.110 --> 35:01.374
She wants to help, Brian.

35:01.446 --> 35:06.679
Oh, good. Does she have a time machine
so we can go back and undo everything?

35:08.753 --> 35:10.744
Brian, what's going on?

35:13.758 --> 35:15.692
You wouldn't listen.

35:15.760 --> 35:17.694
You wouldn't stop.

35:17.762 --> 35:19.753
So you admit you did this?

35:21.132 --> 35:25.535
You go off on your adventures.
You fly your planes.

35:25.603 --> 35:29.232
You drop by every now and then
with a bright idea.

35:30.642 --> 35:32.337
Ever since we were kids.

35:33.578 --> 35:36.513
You're always biting off more
than you can chew...

35:36.581 --> 35:39.345
and I'm always
having to bail you out.

35:39.417 --> 35:42.409
So you doctored the books?

35:42.487 --> 35:44.352
I had to!

35:44.422 --> 35:47.152
I had to do something.
I told you.

35:47.225 --> 35:48.658
We were overextended.

35:48.726 --> 35:53.186
The stock price was the only thing keeping
us afloat, and you wouldn't listen.

35:54.466 --> 35:55.933
No, I don't believe this.

35:57.101 --> 36:00.036
Alec, who do you think told the SEC?

36:00.104 --> 36:02.368
Why? Why now?

36:02.440 --> 36:03.964
What difference
could it make, Brian?

36:04.042 --> 36:08.103
- Once the truth came out-
- Alec, I almost died in that plane too.

36:09.647 --> 36:11.706
I still have a family.

36:12.550 --> 36:14.142
- They tried to kill us.
- Who?

36:14.219 --> 36:17.313
Did you really think they were going
to let you tell a secret like this?

36:17.388 --> 36:20.653
- What are you talking-
- They call themselves The Trust.

36:26.498 --> 36:27.965
Look, all I know is...

36:28.032 --> 36:29.966
they're very powerful...

36:31.336 --> 36:35.602
and they think that Washington abdicated
its duty to protect the planet...

36:35.673 --> 36:37.664
maybe even caused the problem
in the first place.

36:38.243 --> 36:41.303
They see it
as their responsibility to step in.

36:44.415 --> 36:45.575
We can fix this.

36:46.951 --> 36:50.409
It's too late. It's done.
It can't be undone.

36:50.955 --> 36:52.923
Brian, we'll both go to jail.

36:53.558 --> 36:56.083
Yeah, but my family will be safe.

36:56.160 --> 36:59.095
Well, what about the rest of the people
that work for this company?

36:59.163 --> 37:01.631
What about their families?

37:01.699 --> 37:04.691
Why weren't you thinking about them
three days ago?

37:08.072 --> 37:09.596
How did they know?

37:10.842 --> 37:13.936
How did the people who threatened you
know that you'd cooked the books?

37:14.012 --> 37:17.448
How did they know that there would be
enough to indict both you and Alec?

37:26.124 --> 37:28.615
They got to you six months ago.

37:30.194 --> 37:34.187
Alec, they knew what you had.
Don't ask me how.

37:37.235 --> 37:39.965
They had to make sure
they could stop you.

37:41.773 --> 37:43.934
You were wrong, Alec.

37:46.177 --> 37:48.168
True or not...

37:50.348 --> 37:51.781
this shouldn't come out.

37:56.788 --> 37:59.120
The world's not ready.

38:02.193 --> 38:04.559
There must be something we can do.

38:04.629 --> 38:05.994
You signed false financial statements.

38:06.064 --> 38:08.396
No, I mean about the people
who tried to kill us.

38:09.968 --> 38:11.902
All I know is that
they operate above the law...

38:11.970 --> 38:13.961
and that they've threatened
people's lives before.

38:14.772 --> 38:18.105
- Then we have to bring them down.
- We've tried. Believe me.

38:18.743 --> 38:20.938
Well, we have to try again.

38:27.819 --> 38:32.222
So Colson's convinced Vogler to arrange a
meeting with his contact and wear a wire.

38:32.290 --> 38:34.850
Hopefully, we'll get enough
to connect him to the rogue NI D...

38:34.926 --> 38:36.860
and then flip him for someone bigger.

38:36.928 --> 38:38.862
We're coordinating with Agent Barrett.

38:38.930 --> 38:41.330
At the very least,
it may restore Colson's public image.

38:41.399 --> 38:42.923
Especially if it turns out...

38:43.001 --> 38:45.367
that someone in direct corporate
competition with Colson Industries...

38:45.436 --> 38:47.802
was pulling the strings.

38:47.872 --> 38:50.705
Unfortunately,
without further evidence...

38:50.775 --> 38:52.402
Brian Vogler's word alone...

38:52.477 --> 38:55.844
isn't gonna be enough to undo all
the damage already done to the company.

38:55.913 --> 38:58.473
What of Brian Vogler's safety?

38:58.549 --> 39:01.484
He's under close surveillance. His family
has been taken into protective custody.

39:02.854 --> 39:04.151
Well...

39:04.222 --> 39:07.282
I guess the secret is safe again.

39:07.358 --> 39:08.518
For now.

39:13.364 --> 39:16.197
You know, I wouldn't
count Colson out just yet.

39:16.267 --> 39:19.168
He still feels really strongly that
the world should know the truth.

39:20.371 --> 39:22.862
All right.
Thank you.

39:27.845 --> 39:31.645
Surveillance just found Brian Vogler
dead in his bathroom.

39:32.283 --> 39:34.843
What? How?

39:35.920 --> 39:37.410
He hanged himself.

40:17.962 --> 40:19.827
I'm so sorry about Brian.

40:19.897 --> 40:21.364
I killed him.

40:22.467 --> 40:25.300
Might as well have put the gun
against his head...

40:25.369 --> 40:26.597
and pulled the trigger myself.

40:26.671 --> 40:28.229
You couldn't have known.

40:29.941 --> 40:32.967
You saw how scared he was.

40:33.044 --> 40:36.138
I know what his family
meant to him.

40:36.214 --> 40:39.149
He was never going to do anything
to put them in any danger.

40:41.652 --> 40:43.882
He was my best friend.

40:46.257 --> 40:47.747
- He betrayed you.
- No.

40:48.659 --> 40:50.593
I betrayed him.

40:52.597 --> 40:54.724
Why don't you
put the gun down.

41:00.972 --> 41:02.303
My life's over, Sam.

41:03.775 --> 41:07.973
Everything I worked for,
everything I believed in, held to be true-

41:08.045 --> 41:09.569
Still exists.

41:11.149 --> 41:13.845
Apparently Congress
is looking into providing relief.

41:13.918 --> 41:16.284
The companies,
the employees will survive.

41:16.354 --> 41:19.255
While I go to jail
for something I didn't do?

41:20.258 --> 41:23.785
Back on the alpha site
you said, no matter what...

41:23.861 --> 41:26.329
you would rather make
whatever time you had left meaningful.

41:28.199 --> 41:30.827
I'm here to give you that chance.

41:30.902 --> 41:32.836
How?

41:32.904 --> 41:36.169
By making all the indictments
against me just disappear?

41:37.141 --> 41:40.008
I was thinking more along the lines
of making you disappear.

41:41.345 --> 41:44.314
Problem with a guy like me-

41:44.382 --> 41:46.680
no place on Earth I can hide.

41:46.751 --> 41:48.378
Who's talking about Earth?

41:52.790 --> 41:55.657
Oh, no.
I couldn't let you do that.

41:55.726 --> 41:59.992
Believe me. I wouldn't be here
without the approval of my superiors.

42:00.832 --> 42:03.562
The president wasn't responsible
for what happened to you...

42:03.634 --> 42:06.626
but he's also not sorry that
you were publicly discredited.

42:09.040 --> 42:11.804
Please, Alec, come with me.

42:11.876 --> 42:14.902
You can still make a difference.

42:16.547 --> 42:18.208
"He who fights and runs away"-

42:31.028 --> 42:33.019
"Lives to fight another day."

42:41.072 --> 42:44.098
And no one will ever know.

42:45.176 --> 42:46.837
Welcome to my world.
