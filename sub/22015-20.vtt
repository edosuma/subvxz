sexually based offenses

00:10.488 --> 00:12.229

the dedicated detectives

the Special Victims Unit.

00:19.758 --> 00:22.718
These are their stories.

One will be taken
and the other left.

02:24.753 --> 02:26.363
She locked herself
in the bathroom.

02:26.407 --> 02:28.148
Looks like somebody roughed
her up a little.

to either one of you?

02:48.646 --> 02:51.171
- Not a word.
- Okay.

02:51.214 --> 02:53.651
All right, honey.

Looks like you got hit

Okay. Easy. Easy. Easy.
Back--back off.

Lose the gurney.

I'll be punished.

05:36.684 --> 05:39.426
- I'm not allowed to ride
on a train.

05:39.469 --> 05:40.731
- That doesn't
sound like something

05:40.775 --> 05:43.691
you should be
punished for.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.736
- "The Lord has disciplined
me severely.

05:45.780 --> 05:47.956
But he has not given me
over to death."

05:51.960 --> 05:54.615
- Have you learned
the good book, too?

05:56.791 --> 05:58.923
- Yeah, I used to go to church
a lot when I was a little girl.

05:58.967 --> 06:03.188
My grandmama, she played
the organ every Sunday.

06:05.234 --> 06:07.889
Hey, who told you
you'd be punished

06:07.932 --> 06:10.457
if you rode the train?

06:10.500 --> 06:13.111
- Fathers, do not provoke
your children to anger,

06:13.155 --> 06:14.417
but bring them up
with the discipline

06:14.461 --> 06:16.419
and the instruction
of the Lord.

06:21.206 --> 06:23.252
- She's incredibly
malnourished,

06:23.295 --> 06:24.514
barely 90 pounds.

06:24.558 --> 06:26.211
She keeps asking
for more food,

06:26.255 --> 06:28.431
but we've got to take it slow.

06:28.475 --> 06:30.564
- I'm sure you noticed
the abrasions on her forehead.

06:30.607 --> 06:32.217
There's also chafing
on her ankles

06:32.261 --> 06:33.697
and her wrists.
She might have been tied up.

06:33.741 --> 06:35.482
- Okay,
did you do a tox

06:35.525 --> 06:38.789
- We tried. She looked
at the needle and flipped out.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.096
Won't answer any questions
about her medical history.

06:41.139 --> 06:43.185
I doubt she's bathed in weeks.

06:43.228 --> 06:44.882
- Okay, what about
a rape kit?

06:44.926 --> 06:46.318
- Did she say
she'd been assaulted?

06:46.362 --> 06:47.842
- No, but she--she's
so traumatized,

06:47.885 --> 06:49.321
I wouldn't be surprised.

06:49.365 --> 06:51.454
- Well, she barely let me
swab her mouth for saliva.

06:51.498 --> 06:53.500
I can't imagine subjecting her
to a pelvic exam right now.

06:53.543 --> 06:55.153
- Do you need to keep her
overnight?

06:55.197 --> 06:56.285
- I don't think so.

06:56.328 --> 06:57.678
You can have her
for a few hours.

06:57.721 --> 07:00.420
We've already reached out
to child services.

07:03.727 --> 07:05.512
- Hey, lieutenant.
Of the four commuters

07:05.555 --> 07:07.775
on the train that I talked to,
nobody remembers seeing Esther.

07:07.818 --> 07:09.690
Also her prints are not
in the system.

07:11.256 --> 07:12.606
- There was semen
in her underwear.

07:12.649 --> 07:14.869
Send them to the ME
for DNA profiling.

07:14.912 --> 07:17.219
- So we may be looking
at a sex crime

07:17.262 --> 07:18.960
on top of the abuse.

07:19.003 --> 07:21.397
Okay, I'll talk to her
and see if I can find out

07:21.441 --> 07:22.790
what is going on here.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.575
Rollins has already
kind of made

07:25.619 --> 07:27.534
a connection with this girl.
- So you're thinking

07:27.577 --> 07:30.450
another strange face
may not be the best idea?

07:32.103 --> 07:33.844
Okay.

07:34.932 --> 07:36.499
- Hey.

07:36.543 --> 07:38.501
Dr. Hale said
that it would be fine

07:38.545 --> 07:41.243
for you to have a slice
but I don't think two slices

07:41.286 --> 07:43.811
will do too much damage.

07:47.249 --> 07:49.599
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

07:56.476 --> 07:58.129
I know you got to be scared,
Esther,

07:58.173 --> 08:00.001
but I'm really
just trying to help you.

08:00.044 --> 08:02.307
You understand that, right?

08:03.613 --> 08:07.617
Is there a reason you might
not want to go back home?

08:10.838 --> 08:13.797
Do you live in a house
or an apartment?

08:14.755 --> 08:19.324
- A house...
with white window frames.

08:19.368 --> 08:22.589
- You have brothers
or sisters?

08:22.632 --> 08:25.287
- Yes.

08:25.330 --> 08:28.943
- You must miss them.

08:28.986 --> 08:31.815
Is there a reason why
you wanted to leave your home?

08:34.992 --> 08:36.298
- I was scared.

08:44.959 --> 08:48.397
- But the Lord says do not fear
for I am with you.

08:48.440 --> 08:50.094
Do not be dismayed,
for I will uphold you

08:50.138 --> 08:53.141
with my righteous hand.

08:53.184 --> 08:55.099
- Is your father
the one that--

08:55.143 --> 08:56.492
that hurt your head?

08:56.536 --> 08:58.146
- I-I-I fell.

08:58.189 --> 09:02.454
- Esther, did...did your father
force you to have sex with him?

09:06.110 --> 09:07.808
- No.

09:07.851 --> 09:10.550
- But you had sex
with somebody.

09:15.337 --> 09:17.165
- Hey.

09:17.208 --> 09:19.950
It's okay.
It's okay.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.736
I can tell she's smart
by the biblical connections

09:22.779 --> 09:24.651
she's making--
- But it's like it was drilled

09:24.694 --> 09:26.000
into her--
- Oh yeah, this goes way past

09:26.043 --> 09:27.349
the Sunday school
indoctrination

09:27.392 --> 09:28.829
my mom made me sit through.

09:28.872 --> 09:31.048
This is a form of control.
It's a way to discourage

09:31.092 --> 09:32.659
analytical thinking.
- Or a place to turn

09:32.702 --> 09:34.617
if she's lost or in pain.

09:34.661 --> 09:37.968
- Or scare you into thinking
you're gonna burn in hell

09:38.012 --> 09:40.188
if you--you wear a skirt
above your knee.

09:40.231 --> 09:41.798
I mean, somebody's doing this
to keep her in line

09:41.842 --> 09:43.365
and she's still
protecting them.

09:43.408 --> 09:44.627
- DNA's back.

09:44.671 --> 09:47.021
No hits on any
of the databases.

09:47.064 --> 09:48.892
But it's a familial match.

09:48.936 --> 09:50.807
- Well, the perp shares

09:50.851 --> 09:54.289
partial matches with Esther
in ten alleles.

09:54.332 --> 09:55.682
- Okay, so the father's out.

09:55.725 --> 09:59.033
- Yeah, so it's a brother
or an uncle, maybe.

10:15.136 --> 10:15.353
.

10:15.397 --> 10:17.225
- Our girl is safe
and sound

10:17.268 --> 10:18.748
in the custody
of child services.

10:18.792 --> 10:20.141
- Did you make
any headway with her?

10:20.184 --> 10:21.359
- No, every time I go
near sex, she shuts down

10:21.403 --> 10:22.926
or she recites some of
that scripture

10:22.970 --> 10:24.798
she's been brainwashed with.
- Okay. So,

10:24.841 --> 10:27.104
we're going to have to do
the heavy lifting here.

10:27.148 --> 10:29.716
Would be nice to know
who she actually is.

10:29.759 --> 10:31.239
- Not much to go on.

10:31.282 --> 10:32.588
There's no
missing persons report

10:32.632 --> 10:34.068
matching Esther's description.

10:34.111 --> 10:36.026
- She probably lives off
the Port Washington Branch

10:36.070 --> 10:38.072
of that commuter train.
- Okay, Rollins,

10:38.115 --> 10:39.726
get her picture
to the local media.

10:39.769 --> 10:41.205
Somebody has to recognize her.

10:41.249 --> 10:43.207
- On it.
- Carisi and I'll check

10:43.251 --> 10:46.080
the Long Island railroad
security cams.

10:49.736 --> 10:52.782
- And the thing is it all
goes on video these days.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.523
There's no such thing as
the Fourth Amendment

10:54.566 --> 10:56.264
in the five boroughs.

10:56.307 --> 10:58.440
Guess that's why all the cops
I know live in Nassau County.

10:58.483 --> 11:01.443
- She was on the 8:17 out
of Port Washington.

11:01.486 --> 11:04.011
She got on after
the Little Neck station.

11:04.054 --> 11:07.101
- So let's start
with Douglaston.

11:07.144 --> 11:11.409
This is just as
the 8:17's pulling in.

11:13.063 --> 11:15.283
- That's her right there.

11:22.769 --> 11:24.422
- Freeze.

11:24.466 --> 11:25.423
- Those two guys have on

11:25.467 --> 11:27.469
the same jacket
the girl had on.

11:27.512 --> 11:29.471
- You know how many
army surplus stores

11:29.514 --> 11:31.865
there are in Douglaston?

11:33.562 --> 11:35.129
I see you carry parkas.

11:35.172 --> 11:38.610
- Snorkel parkas, sure.
You in the market?

11:38.654 --> 11:41.309
- Well, actually, I'm looking
for the name of anyone

11:41.352 --> 11:43.398
who bought one
in the last five years.

11:43.441 --> 11:45.792
- I must have sold
hundreds of those things.

11:45.835 --> 11:47.968
- Okay, how about
I narrow it down.

11:48.011 --> 11:50.361
Any customer who bought
at least three of them

11:50.405 --> 11:52.407
at the same time.

11:52.450 --> 11:55.105
- That I could check.

11:58.892 --> 12:02.809
We sold three of those
last year to a...

12:02.852 --> 12:06.334
David Johnson.
- Okay.

12:06.377 --> 12:09.772
- Is David Johnson
one of these guys?

12:09.816 --> 12:12.166
- Wouldn't know.
Didn't make the sale.

12:12.209 --> 12:13.689
Sorry.

12:15.125 --> 12:16.736
We start randomly canvassing
Douglaston?

12:16.779 --> 12:18.389
- If we have to, yes.
- Esther's on her way back here

12:18.433 --> 12:20.217
and I'd really like another go.

12:20.261 --> 12:23.003
- Look this TLC approach isn't
working with this girl.

12:23.046 --> 12:24.656
I say we try a little fire
and brimstone this time.

12:26.136 --> 12:27.311
- How are we gonna find
a perp if she won't

12:27.355 --> 12:28.791
even tell us where she lives?

12:28.835 --> 12:30.271
- Okay,
how about we give Amanda

12:30.314 --> 12:31.838
a little more one

12:31.881 --> 12:32.839
- Thanks.

12:32.882 --> 12:34.928
- Excuse me...

12:34.971 --> 12:38.540
I'm here for my daughter,
Esther.

12:38.583 --> 12:40.237
Esther Labott.

12:40.281 --> 12:42.283
My wife saw her picture
on the news.

12:42.326 --> 12:45.242
- Yeah, we've been waiting
for you, Mr. Labott.

12:45.286 --> 12:47.636
I'm--I'm Lieutenant Benson.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.727
- Yeah, Esther's just fine.

12:51.771 --> 12:54.077
- Okay,
so help--help us understand.

12:54.121 --> 12:56.514
If you were worried
about your daughter,

12:56.558 --> 13:00.214
why didn't you file
a missing persons report?

13:00.257 --> 13:02.085
- We called
the Toms River Police.

13:02.129 --> 13:06.089
They told us we had
to wait 24 hours.

13:06.133 --> 13:08.570
They were no help whatsoever.

13:10.790 --> 13:13.227
- Here.

13:14.794 --> 13:16.143
- Yesterday.

13:16.186 --> 13:18.188
My wife and I woke up
and she was gone.

13:18.232 --> 13:22.323
- These two guys.
You ever seen 'em before?

13:22.366 --> 13:25.195
- No.
- So it's just a coincidence

13:25.239 --> 13:27.676
that they have on the same
coats as your daughter?

13:27.719 --> 13:30.418
- My daughter doesn't
have a coat like that.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.333
I appreciate you finding
my daughter

13:32.376 --> 13:36.250
but right now I just
want to take her home.

13:36.293 --> 13:38.818
- In cases where
there's potential abuse,

13:38.861 --> 13:42.909
we can't just hand over
a child to her parents.

13:42.952 --> 13:45.085
- Esther is not a child.

13:45.128 --> 13:48.001
She's 27 years old.

13:56.139 --> 13:58.272
- Oh, my God.

14:09.152 --> 14:14.244
- Praise Jesus, Esther.
Esther. Esther.

14:16.290 --> 14:19.728
What happened?
Did someone take you?

14:19.771 --> 14:22.296
- No, no, no.
I-I ran away.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.912
- I'm sorry, Papa.

14:30.782 --> 14:34.264
- Esther,
your mother was inconsolable.

14:34.308 --> 14:37.006
You know better, Esther.

14:40.531 --> 14:43.230
- Children, obey your parents
in all things:

14:43.273 --> 14:44.971
for this is well pleasing
unto the Lord.

14:45.014 --> 14:48.757
- Mr. Labott...

14:48.800 --> 14:50.846
This may be difficult to hear,

14:50.890 --> 14:52.152
but when we found Esther

14:52.195 --> 14:55.503
she had semen in
her underwear

14:55.546 --> 14:56.504
and we tested it

14:56.547 --> 14:59.986
and it was
a close familial match.

15:00.029 --> 15:02.379
- I'm not surprised.

15:04.512 --> 15:06.557
My wife...

15:06.601 --> 15:10.344
She found Esther
and her brother...

15:10.387 --> 15:13.260
at laying together.

15:13.303 --> 15:15.740
I'll admit,
I did paddle her,

15:15.784 --> 15:18.265
but I most certainly did not
abuse my daughter.

15:18.308 --> 15:21.616
Hmm?

15:21.659 --> 15:24.706
- Esther fasts to gain
spiritual understanding.

15:26.229 --> 15:28.318
- When she decides to fast,
I often join her.

15:28.362 --> 15:31.321
So you don't eat
for three weeks, either?

15:31.365 --> 15:32.540
Hmm?

15:36.239 --> 15:38.763
- We live
an unconventional lifestyle,

15:38.807 --> 15:41.244
off the grid,
homeschooling our children...

15:41.288 --> 15:44.769
but we are a loving,
law-abiding family

15:46.075 --> 15:47.424
It's time for us to go.

15:47.468 --> 15:49.209
- Nobody's going anywhere.
- Hey, hey, hey!

15:49.252 --> 15:50.993
- Back up, sir.
Back up.

15:51.037 --> 15:53.169
Okay?
We have...

15:53.213 --> 15:55.041
A lot more questions.

15:55.084 --> 15:57.434
- Which you can refer
to my lawyer.

15:57.478 --> 15:59.915
If you try to detain me
or my daughter,

15:59.959 --> 16:04.267
I can promise you there will be
legal consequences.

16:04.311 --> 16:07.618
- Give Mr. Labott
his phone call.

16:14.321 --> 16:17.454
- You don't have to go
with your father.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.241
- I won't go against
Papa's wishes.

16:21.284 --> 16:25.375
- We can protect you if you're
scared of going home, Esther.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.291
Why don't you take
some more time?

16:28.335 --> 16:31.120
Maybe--maybe another night
to think about it, okay?

16:31.991 --> 16:33.383
- He loves me.

16:33.427 --> 16:35.255
He didn't do anything wrong.

16:35.298 --> 16:38.823
- Did...somebody else
in your family?

16:38.867 --> 16:41.087
- No one did anything to me.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.611
I want to go home,
Amanda.

16:55.492 --> 16:58.626
- She insists on leaving with
that self-righteous creep.

16:58.669 --> 17:00.454
- Labott's a piece of work.
- There's nothing worse

17:00.497 --> 17:02.151
than a Bible-thumping
hypocrite.

17:02.195 --> 17:04.110
- Okay, let's stay focused.
Carisi, what did we learn

17:04.153 --> 17:05.546
from New Jersey?

17:05.589 --> 17:08.070
- Labott used to teach geology
at Trenton Tech.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.593
He made a little money
off this patent,

17:09.637 --> 17:11.465
something to do with
water filtration.

17:11.508 --> 17:13.554
- Birth certificate
and his driver's license

17:13.597 --> 17:15.295
are legit.
- And I got off the phone

17:15.338 --> 17:17.427
with Stone.
Turns out, believe it or not,

17:17.471 --> 17:20.169
incest is not illegal
in the Garden State.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.215
- There's no rape,
there's no assault.

17:22.258 --> 17:23.651
- Plus the girl's over 18.

17:23.694 --> 17:26.697
So endangerment
and child abuse is out.

17:32.355 --> 17:35.750
- Cut him loose.
- No, we can't let Esther

17:35.793 --> 17:38.753
leave with that man.
- Amanda, if she chooses

17:38.796 --> 17:40.494
to leave, it is her choice
and there's nothing

17:40.537 --> 17:42.061
that we can do--
- Not one thing

17:42.104 --> 17:43.714
in his story makes sense.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.977
I mean the Labotts don't
file a missing persons report.

17:46.021 --> 17:47.849
- I know that, I agree--
- She ends up 90 miles

17:47.892 --> 17:49.677
away from home with these two
guys in matching jackets...

17:49.720 --> 17:52.071
- Agree with you, right, but...
- Hunting her down.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.160
- She is a competent adult.

17:54.203 --> 17:56.771
Labott knows his rights
and there is nothing we can do.

17:56.814 --> 17:59.165
- She's not competent.
She's brainwashed.

17:59.208 --> 18:02.820
She--she was tied up, Liv.
She was starved.

18:02.864 --> 18:04.387
- I understand that,

18:04.431 --> 18:07.303
but in New York state
there is no crime

18:07.347 --> 18:09.392
that we can charge him with.

18:14.397 --> 18:16.965
- I can't believe
this is happening.

18:21.012 --> 18:23.754
You're free to leave.

18:23.798 --> 18:26.192
- Thank you
for finding my daughter.

18:26.235 --> 18:29.020
- Don't mention it.
- Let's go, dear.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.415
- Good-bye, Amanda.

18:49.867 --> 18:50.041
.

18:50.085 --> 18:52.392
- Hey, Liv.

18:52.435 --> 18:54.307
I just--I can just make it
home to read to Noah.

18:54.350 --> 18:56.961
- I want to apologize
for going off on you today.

18:57.005 --> 18:59.703
- Amanda, you and I both know
how hard it is

18:59.747 --> 19:01.618
to walk away from something
when your gut

19:01.662 --> 19:04.795
is screaming
that--that something's wrong.

19:04.839 --> 19:07.276
- I overreacted.
And...

19:07.320 --> 19:10.540
I'm thinking that I could use
a mental health day or two.

19:13.108 --> 19:15.502
You want to dig in on Labott?

19:15.545 --> 19:17.591
Fin and Carisi said

19:17.634 --> 19:19.767
they'd hold down the fort.

19:19.810 --> 19:24.163
- Do not ruffle any feathers
in New Jersey.

19:24.206 --> 19:27.166
- I won't.
- And you keep me in the loop.

19:27.209 --> 19:28.732
- I will.

19:28.776 --> 19:31.082
Thank you.

19:45.706 --> 19:47.577
- Labott's three months
in arrears.

19:49.057 --> 19:52.626
- I rented to him about
four years ago.

19:52.669 --> 19:55.019
- Labott!

20:06.422 --> 20:11.122
I don't believe this.

20:11.166 --> 20:12.950
Look what these animals
did to my property.

20:12.994 --> 20:15.823
- I've no idea.

20:15.866 --> 20:18.869
He said he had lots of kids,
but...

20:27.487 --> 20:30.925
There's a dead rabbit in there.

20:34.755 --> 20:36.104
Going through
the Labotts' mail.

20:36.147 --> 20:38.062
That's a federal offense,
you know.

20:38.106 --> 20:39.716
- Won't be a problem.

20:39.760 --> 20:41.849
- Oh, sorry.
- No, it's okay.

20:41.892 --> 20:44.155
When's the last time
you saw the family?

20:44.199 --> 20:47.115
- They moved out
a couple of months ago.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.422
- Did you ever notice
anything unusual about them?

20:49.465 --> 20:51.075
Maybe with the kids?

20:51.119 --> 20:53.252
- Oh, they stayed inside,
mostly.

20:53.295 --> 20:56.255
Debbie told me that they
were licensed as a home school.

20:56.298 --> 20:58.257
- Oh, the lady of the house.

20:58.300 --> 21:01.347
She paid me
to forward their mail.

21:01.390 --> 21:03.087
- I'm going to need
that address.

21:03.131 --> 21:05.089
- I have it inside.
- Great.

21:05.133 --> 21:10.225
- It's some place in Queens,
it--ah! Douglaston.

22:32.394 --> 22:35.092
- Children, let's take
a picture before we begin.

22:35.136 --> 22:38.182
Line up here.

22:38.226 --> 22:40.837
Would you mind
taking our picture?

22:40.881 --> 22:44.014
- Sure.
- Thank you.

22:44.058 --> 22:48.105
Okay, don't forget to smile.

22:53.197 --> 22:56.636
Thank you so much.
Thank you.

22:56.679 --> 22:59.987
Let's go bowling.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.294
Bowling, let's go.

23:22.401 --> 23:24.141
- Each kid got to bowl
one frame.

23:24.185 --> 23:26.448
- They look like some kind
of reality show.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.058
- Outfits are a bit much,
but other than that,

23:28.102 --> 23:29.843
looks like a pretty normal
family outing.

23:29.886 --> 23:31.322
- Yeah, William bought
five hot dogs

23:31.366 --> 23:33.063
and broke them in half
for the kids.

23:33.107 --> 23:34.456
- Well, maybe he's low on cash.

23:34.500 --> 23:37.154
- Look, the kids
all look underweight.

23:37.198 --> 23:39.200
And what happened in
that house in New Jersey

23:39.243 --> 23:42.029
wasn't about poverty
or cutesy outfits.

23:42.072 --> 23:45.075
The Labott family
is its own patriarchal cult.

23:45.119 --> 23:47.469
Now this so-called father has
them inbreeding

23:47.513 --> 23:49.297
and scrounging for food
like rats.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.255
- Like the Turpin family
out in California.

23:52.866 --> 23:55.564
- Well, if the incest happened
in Queens, it's a felony.

23:55.608 --> 23:58.262
- So you want to press charges
on her now?

23:58.306 --> 24:00.743
- Who even knows if that
was really voluntary?

24:00.787 --> 24:02.266
Esther may not be a minor,

24:02.310 --> 24:03.659
but most of
the Labott kids are.

24:03.703 --> 24:05.487
- Have there been any
complaints to child services

24:05.531 --> 24:07.489
in Queens or New Jersey?
- No, but--I mean

24:07.533 --> 24:09.143
the neighbors have
to have their head in the sand

24:09.186 --> 24:11.754
if they don't
see what's going on, right?

24:11.798 --> 24:15.105
- Taking this kind of personal,
Amanda.

24:15.149 --> 24:17.978
- If I don't,
what am I doing here?

24:24.027 --> 24:25.899
- They moved in
a couple months ago...

24:25.942 --> 24:27.988
I saw the guy shoveling
his driveway once.

24:28.031 --> 24:29.511
We both waved
at each other.

24:29.555 --> 24:31.600
That's about it.

24:33.341 --> 24:35.386
- I've seen a bunch of them
piling in their minivan

24:35.430 --> 24:37.476
a couple times.
They look weird.

24:37.519 --> 24:40.304
- They're all pale, scrawny.

24:40.348 --> 24:42.176
They all wear
these green jackets

24:42.219 --> 24:44.570
and the same sneakers,
like some kind of uniform.

24:44.613 --> 24:46.180
- Well, do you ever see them
leave the house

24:46.223 --> 24:48.312
to go to school
or do they play outside?

24:48.356 --> 24:49.792
- They're not on the school bus
with my two boys.

24:49.836 --> 24:52.186
Their lights are on all night.
I see them inside...

24:52.229 --> 24:53.535
marching back and forth,

24:53.579 --> 24:55.537
back and forth.

24:55.581 --> 24:59.149
And you never thought to call
Social Services, maybe?

24:59.193 --> 25:01.151
- Hey, I mind my own business.

25:01.195 --> 25:03.414
As far as I know, they're not
doing anything wrong.

25:09.812 --> 25:17.037
♪

25:32.487 --> 25:34.358
- Mom!

25:34.402 --> 25:37.318
Mom!
I'm hungry!

26:13.484 --> 26:16.705
[child hyperventilating
and crying]

26:21.928 --> 26:24.104
Mom!

26:24.147 --> 26:26.106
- No, no, no, shh.
It's okay, it's okay.

26:26.149 --> 26:28.282
All right?
I'm here to help you, okay?

26:28.325 --> 26:30.589
- Mom!
- No, honey, honey, it's okay.

26:30.632 --> 26:33.156
All right? It's okay.
- Rachel.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.811
Rachel, you must not
cry anymore.

26:35.855 --> 26:37.639
- Esther...

26:37.683 --> 26:40.337
- You should not be here.
- No, no.

26:40.381 --> 26:42.296
- You'd better not
be playing the devil's games

26:42.339 --> 26:43.906
in there again.
- You have to go.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.516
- Listen, it's okay, it's okay.
- You have to go.

26:45.560 --> 26:46.605
- I'm going to go get help,
all right?

26:51.653 --> 26:54.221
- Get the hell off
my property.

26:56.049 --> 26:57.790
- You're making
a big mistake.

27:01.184 --> 27:03.273
- Better go now.

27:05.319 --> 27:08.017
- Okay. Okay.

27:23.903 --> 27:24.077
.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.601
- Labott, his wife, at least

27:26.645 --> 27:28.385
nine other family members,
half of 'em kids.

27:28.429 --> 27:29.386
- Yeah,

27:29.430 --> 27:30.605
at least two long guns,

27:30.649 --> 27:32.172
a twelve gauge,
and a semi-auto.

27:32.215 --> 27:34.043
Any threats against kids?

27:34.087 --> 27:36.045
- Not so far.
- Well, we got ESU

27:36.089 --> 27:37.656
and the hostage negotiation
team on the way.

27:37.699 --> 27:39.440
- Okay, well,
I wouldn't classify

27:39.483 --> 27:40.920
the adults in there
as hostages.

27:40.963 --> 27:42.704
They're under the father's sway
and my bet is

27:42.748 --> 27:44.706
that they'd rather stay put
then be liberated.

27:44.750 --> 27:46.142
- Lieutenant.
- Is everyone okay

27:46.186 --> 27:47.709
inside the house?
- Depends on what you mean

27:47.753 --> 27:49.145
by okay.
- Well, now that you're here,

27:49.189 --> 27:50.843
maybe you can explain
what Detective Rollins

27:50.886 --> 27:53.193
is doing antagonizing
the people in my precinct

27:53.236 --> 27:54.716
without any heads
- Let's not...

27:54.760 --> 27:56.718
turn this situation
into a turf war.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.024
- You didn't answer
my question.

27:58.067 --> 27:59.547
- Hey, how about we get
something straight?

27:59.590 --> 28:02.506
I ask you
the questions here.

28:02.550 --> 28:03.986
- I am here as part
of an on-going

28:04.030 --> 28:05.553
abuse investigation
into this family.

28:05.596 --> 28:07.294
- We haven't had
any complaints.

28:07.337 --> 28:09.209
There's a little girl in there

28:09.252 --> 28:11.994
tied up to a radiator
with a chain like a dog.

28:12.038 --> 28:13.692
- Yeah.

28:13.735 --> 28:15.389
- I'm going to go figure out
where the hell ESU is.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.086
- Okay, and when they show up,
you keep them out of sight,

28:17.130 --> 28:19.741
'cause I don't want this
to escalate.

28:19.785 --> 28:21.308
We need to open
a line of communication.

28:21.351 --> 28:23.789
- Well, the local squad tossed
a throw phone up there.

28:23.832 --> 28:25.399
Labott didn't take it.

28:25.442 --> 28:27.836
- Okay, I need a megaphone.

28:35.452 --> 28:38.891
Mr. Labott,
It's Olivia Benson from SVU.

28:38.934 --> 28:42.851
I'd like to talk with you.

28:42.895 --> 28:44.897
Please, Mr. Labott,
I'm concerned

28:44.940 --> 28:47.464
about your children.
Can you at least tell me

28:47.508 --> 28:50.119
that they're okay?

28:50.163 --> 28:54.036
Please, Mr. Labott,
let's just talk.

29:01.652 --> 29:03.524
- I don't know

29:03.567 --> 29:05.439
if that's a good idea, Rollins.
- If we're not making headway

29:05.482 --> 29:08.311
with William, maybe we can
reach him through Esther.

29:09.748 --> 29:12.402
- Okay.

29:12.446 --> 29:14.796
- Mr. Labott.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.537
It's Amanda Rollins.

29:16.580 --> 29:19.453
I-I helped your daughter
Esther out

29:19.496 --> 29:21.107
when they found her
on the train.

29:21.150 --> 29:23.022
Listen,
I'd like to see her.

29:23.065 --> 29:25.372
I care about your daughter
and I-I need to know

29:25.415 --> 29:28.157
that she's all right.

29:30.681 --> 29:32.771
- Go out.

29:34.337 --> 29:36.949
- All right.

29:38.167 --> 29:40.822
Good.
Okay.

29:41.692 --> 29:44.086
- You see, she's fine.

29:46.349 --> 29:48.525
- Thank you, Mr. Labott.

29:48.569 --> 29:50.223
Now, you know what?

29:50.266 --> 29:53.792
Would it be all right if Esther
just went ahead and left?

29:55.837 --> 29:58.840
Into a world where--where
greed and ignorance

29:58.884 --> 30:01.974
are laying waste
to our Mother Earth?

30:02.017 --> 30:05.151
Where technology
has corrupted our society

30:05.194 --> 30:08.415
with narcissism
and alienation?

30:09.720 --> 30:12.680
Esther understands
that the cataclysms

30:12.723 --> 30:16.379
foretold in the good book
have come to pass.

30:16.423 --> 30:17.816
Famine.

30:17.859 --> 30:19.252
The rising seas.

30:19.295 --> 30:21.732
- Come on...
- She needs to shelter

30:21.776 --> 30:23.647
here with her family

30:23.691 --> 30:25.693
for the end of days, period.

30:25.736 --> 30:27.347
- William.

30:27.390 --> 30:30.306
Can she make
that decision for herself?

30:30.350 --> 30:32.352
Like you did.

30:32.395 --> 30:34.571
Esther...

30:34.615 --> 30:38.010
Do you want to stay?

30:38.053 --> 30:40.142
- You speak to me,
not to my daughter.

30:40.186 --> 30:41.056
Go.

30:41.100 --> 30:44.494
- William.
- No, no, no, no.

30:45.887 --> 30:47.280
Oh, no.

30:47.323 --> 30:48.803
- You still think you can
reason with that lunatic?

30:48.847 --> 30:50.674
- As long as
he's still talking to us.

30:52.067 --> 30:53.025
Tell him to send out
the younger children

30:53.068 --> 30:54.287
as a token of good faith.

30:54.330 --> 30:56.202
- Mr. Labott has gone
to great lengths

30:56.245 --> 30:58.857
to isolate himself,
to isolate his family.

30:58.900 --> 31:00.380
No one is coming out
of that house

31:00.423 --> 31:05.211
until he's good and ready.
- Come on.

31:05.254 --> 31:06.777
- Wait.
- I want you guys to spot up...

31:06.821 --> 31:09.084
- That's not a good sign.

31:09.128 --> 31:10.607
Captain.

31:10.651 --> 31:12.218
What's going on?

31:12.261 --> 31:14.785
- There's a blind spot in the
northeast corner of that house.

31:14.829 --> 31:15.830
We're going to put
a couple of guys

31:15.874 --> 31:17.049
on the roof with a polecam.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.615
- You cannot
move in on that house.

31:18.659 --> 31:20.879
- That'll destroy any trust
that we've built up with him.

31:20.922 --> 31:22.184
- I need eyes in there.
- Captain--

31:22.228 --> 31:24.230
- If Labott starts
to lose it...

31:24.273 --> 31:25.927
I can respond
before it's too late.

31:25.971 --> 31:28.103
- Give me one hour
before you escalate this.

31:28.147 --> 31:31.150
- Lieutenant,
stand down.

31:32.151 --> 31:36.633
Or do I have to get
the chief of patrol out here?

31:36.677 --> 31:40.246
ESU 5, do you copy?
- Copy.

31:40.289 --> 31:44.467
- Execute stage one.
- Copy that.

31:47.514 --> 31:54.564
♪

32:16.673 --> 32:19.111
- Coming out.

32:19.154 --> 32:20.590
- Move, move, move, move, move!

32:20.634 --> 32:22.027
- Come on, come on, come on.

32:22.070 --> 32:23.550
- All right, go, go, go.

32:26.335 --> 32:28.294
- Open fire now!

32:40.959 --> 32:42.308
- Hold your fire!

32:42.351 --> 32:45.920
Hold your fire.
- Hold fire! Hold fire!

32:47.661 --> 32:52.100
- No...
No! No!

33:03.329 --> 33:05.853
- Hands up.
Let me see your hands!

33:05.896 --> 33:08.682
- Let's go!

33:08.725 --> 33:11.424
- Down on the ground.

33:11.467 --> 33:13.948
All the way.
All the way down.

33:36.014 --> 33:38.973
- Ma'am, down.
- Appears to be...

33:39.017 --> 33:41.062
- Bathroom clear!

33:42.977 --> 33:45.675
- You're okay.

33:47.242 --> 33:49.940
- Clear!

33:49.984 --> 33:52.552
- A child!

33:57.035 --> 33:59.733
- No...

33:59.776 --> 34:02.953
Esther...
No, don't, no...

34:24.888 --> 34:29.328
- You killed my children.

34:29.371 --> 34:32.026
For what?

34:57.617 --> 34:57.834
.

34:59.488 --> 35:01.011
The ones you didn't kill.

35:01.055 --> 35:02.317
- They're headed
to a hospital.

35:02.361 --> 35:04.711
Then they'll be moved
to foster homes.

35:04.754 --> 35:07.017
- 'Cause you're not
getting out of here.

35:07.061 --> 35:09.063
- Yet I take comfort...

35:09.107 --> 35:11.979
that my family will carry on
and embrace the knowledge

35:12.022 --> 35:14.329
that I gave to them.

35:14.373 --> 35:18.072
- You're demented.

35:18.116 --> 35:21.162
- You say that now.

35:21.206 --> 35:24.470
But you'll remember the name
William Labott when

35:24.513 --> 35:28.300
the fires of the apocalypse
are raging around you...

35:28.343 --> 35:29.953
When you realize...

35:29.997 --> 35:33.043
just as you and your kind
have turned your backs

35:33.087 --> 35:35.350
on Him, so shall He...

35:35.394 --> 35:38.310
turn His back on you...

35:38.353 --> 35:40.747
At the second coming.

35:40.790 --> 35:42.444
- If that woman
hadn't broken in,

35:42.488 --> 35:43.750
none of this
would have happened.

35:43.793 --> 35:45.534
My children would
still be alive.

35:45.578 --> 35:48.972
- Don't you dare try to put
what happened out there on us.

35:49.016 --> 35:51.279
Sit down.

35:51.323 --> 35:53.499
I'm sorry for your loss,

35:53.542 --> 35:56.589
but don't do that.

35:58.417 --> 36:00.419
Explain to me how you could do
those terrible things

36:00.462 --> 36:02.290
to your own kids.

36:02.334 --> 36:04.988
- Open your eyes.

36:05.032 --> 36:08.427
The government's controlled
by Silicon Valley.

36:08.470 --> 36:12.170
Technology is a gateway,
an addiction to everything

36:12.213 --> 36:13.519
that's evil in the world.

36:13.562 --> 36:16.348
We had to trust and abide
in the Lord

36:16.391 --> 36:18.567
and raise our children
so they could flourish

36:18.611 --> 36:20.700
in a cold and corrupt world.

36:20.743 --> 36:26.227
- Is that when the discipline
got worse?

36:26.271 --> 36:29.274
- It didn't happen overnight.

36:29.317 --> 36:32.712
Over the course of time, the...

36:32.755 --> 36:35.018
fasting...

36:35.062 --> 36:37.412
the punishments...

36:37.456 --> 36:40.023
William said that we had
to be strict,

36:40.067 --> 36:41.329
to teach them to be righteous.

36:41.373 --> 36:42.504
We had to be tough on them.

36:42.548 --> 36:44.941
- You were
very tough on them.

36:44.985 --> 36:49.250
- Not always.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.557
Sometimes.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.256
- You knew it was wrong.

36:55.300 --> 36:58.259
Didn't you?
- No.

36:58.303 --> 37:00.130
- I don't believe that,
Mrs. Labott.

37:00.174 --> 37:01.393
I know you ran out
of that house

37:01.436 --> 37:02.959
carrying your little ones.

37:03.003 --> 37:07.137
I know that there's something
still decent inside of you.

37:07.181 --> 37:10.967
Why didn't you say something?

37:11.011 --> 37:15.276
Why didn't you leave when
things started to get worse?

37:15.320 --> 37:18.453
- Because I was afraid.

37:18.497 --> 37:20.499
If I stayed there,
at least I could do

37:20.542 --> 37:23.502
what I could to protect
my babies.

37:27.984 --> 37:32.424
Am I going to go to jail?

37:34.687 --> 37:38.038
- What is going to happen
to Jacob?

37:40.388 --> 37:43.478
My baby.

37:43.522 --> 37:46.786
- So God told you
to torture your kids?

37:46.829 --> 37:50.355
- I was a good father.
Granted, I was severe.

37:50.398 --> 37:53.923
- Your children were tortured.

37:55.403 --> 37:57.710
Broken,
like animals.

37:57.753 --> 37:59.799
- The chains
taught them discipline.

37:59.842 --> 38:01.627
Fasting brought them
closer to God.

38:01.670 --> 38:04.847
- No, you starved
your 27-year-old daughter

38:04.891 --> 38:07.633
her entire life.

38:07.676 --> 38:10.810
She was the size
of a little girl.

38:10.853 --> 38:13.682
You know? It's really--
it's too bad we can't

38:13.726 --> 38:15.467
rain down some
biblical punishment--

38:15.510 --> 38:19.514
- Amanda. Amanda!
- It's really--

38:21.168 --> 38:24.563
- Amanda!
My office, now!

38:35.356 --> 38:38.359
- Amanda.

38:38.403 --> 38:40.361
I know that this is hard.

38:41.971 --> 38:45.279
Just imagine how hard
those kids' lives were.

38:45.323 --> 38:47.629
And then to have to sit there
and listen to that zealot

38:47.673 --> 38:50.284
use God to justify it!
- I get it.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.808
Amanda, but I need you
to get your head on straight.

38:52.852 --> 38:54.419
- Okay. I'm fine.

38:54.462 --> 38:56.072
Do you think you can do that?
- Yes.

38:56.116 --> 38:58.901
- Because when this case
is finally over...

38:58.945 --> 39:01.556
- It is over.

39:01.600 --> 39:03.732
- I wish that were true.

39:08.955 --> 39:10.957
Preliminary ballistics
came back

39:11.000 --> 39:13.394
on the siege
of the Labott house.

39:13.438 --> 39:15.918
- That was fast.

39:17.093 --> 39:22.664
- You fired the bullet
that killed Esther Labott.

39:24.840 --> 39:26.712
- N--

39:34.981 --> 39:37.157
Oh.

39:37.200 --> 39:40.073
Oh, God.

39:40.116 --> 39:42.597
- Amanda.

39:42.641 --> 39:46.558
Oh, my--

39:51.519 --> 39:54.304
- You know the drill.

39:54.348 --> 39:58.221
You're gonna talk to
the force investigative group

39:58.265 --> 40:00.876
and you're gonna talk
to IAB.

40:00.920 --> 40:03.052
And I am confident
that...

40:03.096 --> 40:05.054
that you're going
to be back on the job

40:05.098 --> 40:08.275
in the next few days.

40:11.800 --> 40:15.543

40:16.370 --> 40:18.328
I'm sorry.
