WEBVTT

00:29.863 --> 00:31.164
Read this.

00:32.732 --> 00:35.935
"WGBH has created
an educational program

00:36.036 --> 00:37.937
that genuinely inspires."

00:38.038 --> 00:39.839
This is today's paper?

00:39.906 --> 00:44.077
"Julia Child is a pleasant
and encouraging instructor,

00:44.177 --> 00:46.946
despite teaching recipes
that are hardly quick and easy.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.049
However, if you'll only
stick with her, you'll...

00:49.115 --> 00:51.184
"...find the reward
is delicious."

00:51.251 --> 00:52.185
Good grief.

00:52.252 --> 00:53.620
You memorized it?

00:53.720 --> 00:56.022
"WGBH now looks capable

00:56.089 --> 00:59.793
of producing shows
that won't put you to sleep."

00:59.893 --> 01:01.127
Hmm. A bit harsh.

01:01.227 --> 01:02.395
Insulting.

01:02.462 --> 01:04.731
Now, this station has
a higher mandate,

01:04.798 --> 01:08.802
to elevate and educate
the public.

01:08.902 --> 01:10.470
Maybe Julia's
what we've been missing.

01:10.570 --> 01:14.474
Well, Julia wouldn't have a show
if she weren't my guest first.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.209
I made that woman.

01:21.414 --> 01:24.584
Harry Belafonte.
Are you sure you need this?

01:24.651 --> 01:26.920
Oh, it'll give me a lift
for "Jump In The Line."

01:29.122 --> 01:31.057
Alright, don't --
don't hurt your shaker.

01:31.124 --> 01:32.258
I need you
at my show tonight.

01:35.228 --> 01:36.229
Child residence.

01:36.296 --> 01:39.666
Uh, yes,
uh, just a moment.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.167
It's, uh, for you.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.069
Oh.

01:45.905 --> 01:47.841
Hello?

01:47.941 --> 01:50.510
Oh, that's lovely.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.145
No.

01:52.245 --> 01:54.514
No, it's not supposed to
be sweet.

01:54.614 --> 01:56.783
What brand of cognac
did you use?

01:56.850 --> 01:59.352
Oh, next time just grab
the brandy.

01:59.452 --> 02:01.121
No need for it
to be French.

02:01.187 --> 02:03.022
No, well,
you're very welcome.

02:03.123 --> 02:04.791
Bye-bye.

02:06.693 --> 02:07.660
Was that Gladys?

02:07.760 --> 02:09.362
Well, I have no idea
who that was.

02:09.462 --> 02:11.531
Some woman who watched
the "Coq au Vin" episode

02:11.631 --> 02:14.033
put Grand Marnier
in her stock.

02:14.134 --> 02:15.702
Fourth call this week.

02:15.802 --> 02:18.204
I suppose people really do
have televisions.

02:18.304 --> 02:20.340
Should we
unlist our number?

02:20.440 --> 02:22.876
Well, how else
will they get in touch?

02:22.976 --> 02:24.844
We've gotten dozens
of letters from viewers,

02:24.944 --> 02:27.213
and we just got a stellar
write-up in "The Boston Globe,"

02:27.313 --> 02:28.715
after three episodes.

02:28.815 --> 02:33.052
I really think Philadelphia
<i>needs</i> "The French Chef."

02:33.153 --> 02:36.789
Did I just hear you say
"The French Chef"?

02:37.724 --> 02:41.694
I -- I said, uh,
my friend Seth.

02:41.794 --> 02:43.863
He's on the phone.
You don't know him.

02:43.963 --> 02:46.566
Hang up.

02:46.666 --> 02:49.369
Let me call you back.

02:49.469 --> 02:50.970
Page 5.

02:51.037 --> 02:52.672
Above the fold.

02:54.507 --> 02:55.508
Where did you say?

02:55.575 --> 02:59.345
"Something's Cooking
at WGBH."

02:59.412 --> 03:01.414
Ahh.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.716
This is...bad.

03:03.816 --> 03:05.485
While attempting to create
television

03:05.552 --> 03:07.020
that transforms minds,

03:07.086 --> 03:09.923
I'd forgotten that the world
doesn't value substance.

03:10.023 --> 03:11.758
It values flash,

03:11.858 --> 03:15.261
whizz, bang.

03:15.361 --> 03:16.763
Whatever happened
with Nabokov?

03:16.863 --> 03:18.565
He's still
across the pond.

03:18.665 --> 03:19.599
Cummings?

03:19.699 --> 03:21.501
He just died.

03:21.568 --> 03:22.435
Kerouac?

03:22.535 --> 03:24.437
On the road, again.

03:26.873 --> 03:28.908
Good morning!

03:29.008 --> 03:30.376
- Morning, Julia!
- Morning, Julia!

03:30.443 --> 03:32.879
Petit fours
for growing boys.

03:32.946 --> 03:34.180
Hello, Marty.

03:34.247 --> 03:36.950
Those little ones still
keeping you awake?

03:37.050 --> 03:38.551
Oh, boy.
Look at that.

03:38.618 --> 03:40.019
Oh, man,
these look amazing.

03:40.086 --> 03:41.754
- Did you try these?
- They look delicious.

03:41.854 --> 03:43.623
Wow. This is good.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.692
How'd you like seeing your name
in the paper today?

03:45.758 --> 03:47.260
Oh, I haven't
seen the paper.

03:47.360 --> 03:49.395
I've been busy
all morning.

03:49.462 --> 03:51.564
There you go.

03:51.631 --> 03:54.801
How wonderful
for all of us.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.303
Nice mention of you
in there, too, Russ.

03:57.403 --> 03:58.638
Oh, come on.
Come on.

03:58.738 --> 04:00.073
What is this,
a tea party?

04:00.139 --> 04:01.975
We have
an episode to tech.

04:02.075 --> 04:03.977
Julia? I'd like to go back
to that shot

04:04.077 --> 04:05.311
of you whisking
the egg whites.

04:05.411 --> 04:07.780
Oh, yes, I said a little prayer
for that shot

04:07.880 --> 04:09.082
just this morning.

04:09.148 --> 04:10.316
Me too.

04:10.416 --> 04:11.918
I think I've figured out
something

04:11.985 --> 04:14.287
where we can actually
get inside the bowl.

04:14.387 --> 04:15.922
Oh, well, that would be
heavenly.

04:15.989 --> 04:17.423
Yeah.

04:18.958 --> 04:21.261
Oh, boy.
That's new.

04:21.327 --> 04:23.429
Used. My friend's
a nature photographer.

04:23.496 --> 04:25.064
Are we still making
a cooking show?

04:25.131 --> 04:26.666
Well, this should give us enough
room where you don't have to

04:26.766 --> 04:27.900
worry about bumping into
my camera

04:27.967 --> 04:29.002
while we're trying to
get the shot.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.803
Gosh. Ingenious.

04:30.903 --> 04:33.339
If it works, it's really gonna
come in handy for us.

04:33.439 --> 04:35.241
Hit it, Julia.

04:42.915 --> 04:45.251
I'm sorry. Julia, you think
maybe you could, uh,

04:45.318 --> 04:46.519
try not to move so much?

04:46.619 --> 04:49.622
Well, it's meant to
be vigorous, boys.

04:49.689 --> 04:52.659
How else does one
achieve stiff peaks?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.628
Good morning!

04:55.695 --> 04:57.030
Good morning, Julia.

04:57.130 --> 04:59.799
Oh, good morning, Hunter.

04:59.866 --> 05:01.034
We're right in the middle
of something, Hunter.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.869
Can you just --

05:06.939 --> 05:08.708
Nice article
in the "Globe" today.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.476
Oh, isn't it wonderful?

05:10.543 --> 05:13.379
Yes.
Just one thing.

05:13.479 --> 05:17.550
Next time, make sure
to highlight WGBH as a whole.

05:17.650 --> 05:19.786
Try and remember the hand
that feeds you, hmm?

05:19.852 --> 05:22.889
Oh, no, no, no.
Nobody spoke to me.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.858
I didn't even know about
the article until a moment ago.

05:25.958 --> 05:27.860
Sure, of course,
but next time,

05:27.960 --> 05:30.363
you'll have to remember
you're part of a team.

05:30.463 --> 05:32.699
Implying our other shows
are boring --

05:32.799 --> 05:34.067
it's insulting, Julia.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.469
Yes, of course, Hunter,
but...

05:36.536 --> 05:40.039
there can't be a "next time"
if there wasn't a first time.

05:40.139 --> 05:43.242
You didn't even think
to mention Albert at all?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.812
To be fair, you did start out
on his show.

05:45.878 --> 05:49.749
But how could I have --

05:49.849 --> 05:51.584
Hunter.

05:51.684 --> 05:55.555
I didn't leave Albert
out of the article.

05:55.655 --> 05:57.390
I didn't even know
about the article.

05:57.490 --> 05:58.758
Yes, yes, of course.

05:58.858 --> 06:00.993
An apology will
go over well

06:01.060 --> 06:03.162
and get him off my back.

06:03.229 --> 06:05.898
Thank you, Julia.
You're a doll.

06:08.067 --> 06:10.570
Julia?
Let's try this again.

06:21.280 --> 06:24.784
I'm so excited to cook
a new Julia recipe.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.587
I'll tell the mailroom to keep
an eye out for the manuscript.

06:27.687 --> 06:28.855
<i> Oh, good, good.</i>

06:28.921 --> 06:30.590
<i>I mailed it this morning.</i>

06:30.690 --> 06:33.760
Well, you're my best guinea pig
with these things.

06:33.860 --> 06:35.461
And don't hold back.

06:35.561 --> 06:36.963
<i>Oh, it will be a treat.</i>

06:37.063 --> 06:39.465
I'm up to my ears in Updike
at the moment.

06:39.565 --> 06:40.733
Oh, yeah.
Busy, busy.

06:40.800 --> 06:42.301
I know the feeling.

06:42.402 --> 06:46.305
In fact, I could really use
your help with something.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.573
What is it?

06:47.640 --> 06:49.108
You wouldn't happen
to have an author

06:49.208 --> 06:50.610
who'd be willing to guest
on "I've Been Reading"

06:50.710 --> 06:52.378
with Albert Duhamel,
would you?

06:52.445 --> 06:54.781
<i>Why? Are you working</i>
<i>with him now?</i>

06:54.881 --> 06:55.948
No, no, no.

06:56.048 --> 06:58.151
No. It's just...

06:58.251 --> 07:00.653
the "Boston Globe" wrote
a lovely piece today

07:00.753 --> 07:03.623
about my silly
little program,

07:03.723 --> 07:05.892
and<i> only</i> my silly
little program, so...

07:05.958 --> 07:08.294
You need a "distract
a jealous manchild

07:08.394 --> 07:10.129
with a shiny object"
favor.

07:10.229 --> 07:12.899
Ha! Oh, Judith,
you are wicked.

07:12.965 --> 07:15.101
But, by George,
I think you've got it.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.336
<i>I just thought</i>
<i>it wouldn't hurt</i>

07:17.437 --> 07:20.339
to direct a bit of shine
their way.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.175
I'll see what I can do
to help.

07:23.943 --> 07:27.246
Oh, I've got to dash.
It's Paul's pre-opening.

07:27.313 --> 07:29.282
I can't promise anything.

07:30.683 --> 07:32.185
Dian!

07:43.196 --> 07:45.298
I'm afraid my art
is less compelling

07:45.364 --> 07:47.433
than the charcuterie board.

07:47.500 --> 07:49.035
Paul.

07:49.135 --> 07:50.436
That mood
doesn't suit you.

07:50.503 --> 07:54.040
Oh, I'm --
I'm being neurotic for fun.

07:55.374 --> 07:57.443
No.
It's good they're eating.

07:57.510 --> 08:00.546
It's easier to shop
when you're full and happy.

08:00.646 --> 08:02.381
And see how long
they're looking?

08:02.482 --> 08:04.183
That man over there's been
at Julia's photo

08:04.283 --> 08:06.486
for quite a while now.

08:06.552 --> 08:08.287
I counted
seven Mississippis.

08:10.323 --> 08:12.225
You know, I'd only been on
a few months,

08:12.325 --> 08:15.661
and Ernest Hemingway
somehow gets word of the show

08:15.728 --> 08:18.297
and tells his wife, you know,
"Next time I'm in Boston,

08:18.364 --> 08:20.566
I want to be a guest
on 'I've Been Reading.'"

08:20.666 --> 08:23.703
Oh!
<i>Incroyable.</i>

08:24.971 --> 08:26.873
Did you meet Papa?

08:26.973 --> 08:28.241
No.

08:28.341 --> 08:30.476
Unfortunately, as we were
starting to get into it,

08:30.543 --> 08:33.179
he --
he took his own life.

08:34.747 --> 08:35.915
Yes, timing is everything.

08:37.350 --> 08:39.252
Good evening, everyone.

08:39.352 --> 08:42.555
Uh, Julia, darling,
please join me.

08:44.724 --> 08:46.392
Sweetheart.

08:46.492 --> 08:47.927
Um...

08:48.027 --> 08:49.929
well, I want to,
uh, welcome

08:50.029 --> 08:53.866
and thank each of you, uh,
for attending tonight.

08:53.933 --> 08:56.736
I'm Paul Child,
and as you may know,

08:56.836 --> 08:59.505
I am not an artist
by trade.

08:59.572 --> 09:01.173
I'm actually a diplomat.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.576
Or a retired diplomat.

09:03.676 --> 09:05.945
But I have been painting
and drawing all my life

09:06.045 --> 09:08.748
and taking photographs
for many years now.

09:08.848 --> 09:11.217
And few people in my life
understood that it --

09:11.284 --> 09:14.453
it wasn't just a hobby.

09:14.554 --> 09:17.256
Perhaps me least of all.

09:17.356 --> 09:20.893
And tonight, you're here,

09:20.960 --> 09:23.296
with me,
to see and to celebrate.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.399
And for that,
I am deeply grateful.

09:26.465 --> 09:27.967
Thank you, Antoine,

09:28.067 --> 09:32.138
for having my work
in your beautiful gallery.

09:32.238 --> 09:34.407
Thank you, Julia, my muse,

09:34.473 --> 09:35.908
not least of all
for the goodies.

09:37.710 --> 09:40.646
And to so many others who are --
who are here tonight,

09:40.746 --> 09:43.783
Avis, my sensei.

09:43.883 --> 09:46.485
The radiant Sylvia Plath.

09:46.586 --> 09:47.587
Honored.

09:47.653 --> 09:49.789
Oh, and Thornton Wilder.

09:49.889 --> 09:52.992
What a joy to have you
in our town.

09:53.092 --> 09:55.261
It is truly my pleasure
to be with

09:55.328 --> 09:57.997
each and every one of you
tonight.

09:58.097 --> 09:59.332
Thank you.

09:59.432 --> 10:01.300
To Paul.

10:01.400 --> 10:03.669
To Paul!

10:03.769 --> 10:05.972
And Paul...

10:09.075 --> 10:10.910
...has sold
his first painting.

10:12.645 --> 10:13.646
Oh, wonderful.

10:13.746 --> 10:15.848
Well...

10:15.948 --> 10:17.850
Oh, my gosh.

10:28.461 --> 10:29.662
Harmony?

10:40.706 --> 10:42.174
Tonight was fun.

10:42.274 --> 10:44.644
Oh. It was.

10:44.710 --> 10:45.878
It was.

10:45.978 --> 10:47.513
I felt like a debutante
at her coming-out party.

10:47.613 --> 10:49.281
And I rather loved it.

10:49.348 --> 10:51.550
So many wonderful people.

10:51.651 --> 10:53.552
It was who's who, really.

10:53.653 --> 10:56.155
And Albert stuffing his pockets
with food

10:56.222 --> 10:57.857
like an out-of-work actor.

10:57.957 --> 11:00.493
Well, so much
for my apology.

11:00.559 --> 11:01.861
And it's not just Albert.

11:01.961 --> 11:04.563
<i>Hunter</i> gave me
a talking-to.

11:04.664 --> 11:07.733
Yes, I think they all need
a bit of a break from me.

11:07.833 --> 11:10.369
Is that why you changed
your mind about the reunion?

11:10.469 --> 11:12.138
It is.

11:12.204 --> 11:13.973
But it does mean
I'm missing your opening.

11:14.040 --> 11:16.208
Oh, nonsense.
I think it's wonderful.

11:16.308 --> 11:18.077
I'm<i> so</i> glad
you changed your mind.

11:18.177 --> 11:21.247
I've wanted you to go
ever since they invited you.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.052
Oh.

11:26.152 --> 11:28.187
And tuck in a rhyming
dictionary for the charlatan,

11:28.254 --> 11:31.257
I mean, poet that you'll be
sitting beside on that panel.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.392
Are we sure I'm not
the charlatan?

11:33.492 --> 11:35.428
Oh, double nonsense.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.596
You're a featured speaker.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.366
Your fame is spreading
beyond Cambridge

11:40.433 --> 11:43.269
and "The Boston Globe" all
the way to the Pioneer Valley.

11:44.437 --> 11:46.706
No more
the lowly undergraduate.

11:46.772 --> 11:50.276
They're showing you
some well-deserved veneration.

11:55.247 --> 11:57.116
Russ, we're ready.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.951
Thank you.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.721
Where's Julia?

12:01.787 --> 12:02.855
What am I,
chopped liver?

12:02.922 --> 12:04.223
When is she coming back?

12:04.290 --> 12:05.791
Tomorrow at noon.

12:05.891 --> 12:07.626
I-I got Mrs. DeVoto
at the proper height.

12:07.727 --> 12:09.361
She can stand in
for her.

12:09.428 --> 12:12.598
Fine. Let's see if
this contraption works.

12:12.698 --> 12:16.135
Alright.
Go ahead, Avis. Hit it.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.470
Start?

12:17.570 --> 12:19.271
Okay.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.479
Bring the bowl
up higher.

12:26.579 --> 12:28.147
No. Too high.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.749
Split the difference.

12:29.815 --> 12:30.816
A little lower.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.152
Just relax.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.488
A little to your left.

12:35.588 --> 12:36.922
Or my left.

12:36.989 --> 12:38.991
Can you feel the lens?

12:39.091 --> 12:40.326
Look at the camera.
See that?

12:40.426 --> 12:41.827
- Geez, it's close.
- Okay.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.997
We want to see you whisking
the eggs in the bowl.

12:45.097 --> 12:46.799
Can you tilt the bowl
towards the camera?

12:46.899 --> 12:48.768
Oh, wait a minute.
What's the line?

12:48.834 --> 12:50.503
Isn't there a line?
She says something.

12:50.603 --> 12:51.771
She's always talking.

12:51.837 --> 12:54.240
I mean -- Oh, my God,
I'm sweating.

12:54.306 --> 12:55.808
Oh.

12:55.908 --> 12:56.909
Her head's covering it.

12:56.976 --> 12:58.144
I'm sorry.
Am I in the way?

12:58.244 --> 13:00.246
Can<i> you</i> move around?

13:00.312 --> 13:02.515
It's just the lights
that are --

13:02.615 --> 13:03.682
Jesus!

13:03.783 --> 13:05.251
- Careful.
- Can we stop for a minute?

13:05.317 --> 13:07.520
- Sure.
- Please. Thank you.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.021
I don't know
how we get this, Russ.

13:09.121 --> 13:10.523
Heads aren't see-through.

13:10.623 --> 13:12.191
Alright.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.201
Benny, grab me a hand mirror
from the work bench.

13:22.301 --> 13:25.671
Oh, Russ, your hair
looks just fine.

13:25.771 --> 13:27.506
I have an idea.

13:29.642 --> 13:32.711
"...where birdsong swells

13:32.812 --> 13:35.447
through a fiery breast,

13:35.514 --> 13:40.019
dewy and warm
like a baby's breath."

13:42.855 --> 13:44.623
Thank you.

13:44.690 --> 13:47.560
Oh, my.

13:47.660 --> 13:49.228
Thank you, Colleen.

13:49.328 --> 13:52.298
And now, last but certainly
not least,

13:52.364 --> 13:54.900
Julia Child,
née McWilliams.

13:55.000 --> 13:56.235
Julia's
bestselling cookbook,

13:56.335 --> 13:58.237
"Mastering the Art
of French Cooking,"

13:58.337 --> 14:00.673
was published by Knopf
in 1961.

14:00.739 --> 14:03.075
And while she is here today
as an author,

14:03.175 --> 14:06.345
I would be remiss if I failed
to mention her television show,

14:06.412 --> 14:09.915
"The French Chef,"
airing on WGBH in Boston.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.083
Welcome, Julia.

14:14.386 --> 14:16.021
Well, thank you for having me.

14:16.088 --> 14:20.226
I, um -- I can't very well
read you a recipe, can I?

14:21.861 --> 14:24.430
I'm just tickled pink to be here
with you ladies.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.999
Oh, aren't you the girl who
almost set the dorms on fire

14:27.066 --> 14:28.500
every time
she made toast?

14:30.870 --> 14:32.004
Thank you, Hazel.

14:32.071 --> 14:34.506
It takes some of us years
of practice

14:34.573 --> 14:36.876
to perfect
a grilled cheese sandwich.

14:39.278 --> 14:41.914
Does anyone have any questions
for Mrs. Child?

14:45.718 --> 14:49.021
It was Willa Cather,
if you can believe it.

14:49.088 --> 14:50.723
Willa? Really?

14:50.789 --> 14:53.626
When she left Houghton Mifflin
for our little upstart,

14:53.726 --> 14:55.728
changed everything.

14:55.794 --> 14:57.463
Mm.
Brave women.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.966
When you find one,
keep her close.

15:01.066 --> 15:02.801
They're like unicorns.

15:02.902 --> 15:05.037
That was Dorothy Parker's
secret.

15:05.104 --> 15:07.206
Sure, she was funny,
for a gentile.

15:07.273 --> 15:10.142
Well, I'd put her in the "Ish"
category.

15:10.242 --> 15:12.945
What set her apart --
she was brave.

15:13.045 --> 15:14.380
Brave?

15:14.446 --> 15:16.215
She was goddamn fearless.

15:16.282 --> 15:17.483
Sorry to interrupt.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.618
Judith, Updike is here.

15:19.718 --> 15:23.088
Oh, well, I'll let you prepare
for the maestro.

15:23.155 --> 15:25.491
I'm a little peckish
myself.

15:25.591 --> 15:28.661
Oh, why don't you take
Julia's new chapter

15:28.761 --> 15:31.830
and cook something amazing
for you and Alfred?

15:31.931 --> 15:33.933
I won't have time to look at it
until next week.

15:33.999 --> 15:35.601
Oh.

15:35.668 --> 15:38.304
Oh, and I can't get anyone
for "I've Been Reading."

15:38.404 --> 15:42.675
Let's start calling people
we gave encouraging "no's" to.

15:42.775 --> 15:43.943
Oh, it's nothing.

15:44.009 --> 15:46.445
Yeah, just a little favor
for a pal.

15:46.512 --> 15:48.914
Good afternoon.

15:48.981 --> 15:51.083
Hello, Blanche.

15:51.150 --> 15:52.952
So good to see you.

15:53.018 --> 15:55.120
Mm.
Sharp as ever.

15:55.187 --> 15:56.956
I was just leaving.

16:01.260 --> 16:02.594
Amazing woman.

16:02.661 --> 16:04.163
Not that I'm not
terrified of her.

16:04.263 --> 16:05.431
Join the club.

16:05.497 --> 16:08.200
Although, after reading
through these notes,

16:08.300 --> 16:11.470
I'm a bit terrified
of you, too.

16:11.537 --> 16:13.172
Why, thank you, John.

16:19.178 --> 16:21.046
Hello.
My name is Alice Naman,

16:21.146 --> 16:24.383
and I am with WGBH in Boston.

16:24.483 --> 16:27.319
Julia is<i> so</i> charming,
and housewives are telling us

16:27.386 --> 16:30.289
she makes them feel
genuinely excited about cooking.

16:31.824 --> 16:33.525
"The French Chef."

16:35.694 --> 16:37.029
"The...French --"

16:37.129 --> 16:38.797
Her fan base is bigger
than what you would think.

16:38.864 --> 16:40.532
In fact, some people
are watching it

16:40.632 --> 16:42.501
just for
the entertainment factor.

16:42.568 --> 16:44.670
She's a gas.

16:44.737 --> 16:47.706
The idea is you watch her cook.

16:47.806 --> 16:49.208
With the Kennedys
in the White House,

16:49.308 --> 16:50.976
French food has never been
so fashionable,

16:51.043 --> 16:52.578
which makes D.C...
Lincoln...

16:52.678 --> 16:53.879
Philadelphia...
Chicago...

16:53.979 --> 16:56.248
Houston the perfect
market for Julia.

16:56.348 --> 16:58.150
No.
No, she's not French.

16:58.217 --> 17:01.920
And we can make a deal
that makes sense for yo--

17:02.021 --> 17:03.255
No. I-I understand.

17:11.063 --> 17:12.931
Albert's looking for you.

17:13.031 --> 17:15.667
He's not happy.

17:15.734 --> 17:17.269
That makes two of us.

17:18.704 --> 17:22.040
Won't it be confusing
to jump around like that?

17:22.107 --> 17:23.776
That's the point, isn't it?

17:23.876 --> 17:25.611
Now, it's been a while
since I've participated

17:25.711 --> 17:27.446
in a drug-fueled orgy.

17:27.546 --> 17:30.949
No, but seriously, I imagine
it can't be totally...

17:31.050 --> 17:32.051
coherent.

17:32.117 --> 17:34.219
Let us<i> feel</i> that.

17:34.286 --> 17:35.454
Sure, sure.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.790
Then when Angela's back
in the picture,

17:37.890 --> 17:42.227
we can really feel that dynamic
shift for Piet in the prose.

17:42.294 --> 17:46.131
He's raging, passionate,
destructive,

17:46.231 --> 17:48.801
until sex is
the only thing left, you know?

17:48.901 --> 17:51.470
It's -- It's heavy.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.272
Right.

17:56.708 --> 17:58.310
Right.

18:00.779 --> 18:04.817
You're like Michelangelo
with the block of granite.

18:04.917 --> 18:06.819
You know
what's not an elephant.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.921
It's easy when
there<i> is</i> an elephant.

18:08.987 --> 18:10.155
You think
there's an elephant?

18:10.255 --> 18:12.591
I think there's
a helluvan elephant.

18:14.760 --> 18:16.061
I'll take another crack.

18:16.128 --> 18:18.497
I just need a couple of days
to...

18:18.597 --> 18:19.798
let it all steep.

18:19.898 --> 18:21.500
Sure.

18:23.502 --> 18:27.139
Any chance you're up for
letting it steep in Boston?

18:27.239 --> 18:29.007
What's in Boston?

18:29.108 --> 18:30.109
Ahh.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.277
Oh, no, girls!

18:32.344 --> 18:33.645
It's happened again!

18:37.449 --> 18:38.917
Well, I can't do
too much damage.

18:38.984 --> 18:41.420
I'm watching my grandkids
tomorrow afternoon.

18:41.487 --> 18:42.921
Oh, that's sweet.

18:42.988 --> 18:44.923
Do you want to
see pictures?

18:44.990 --> 18:46.859
Not really.

18:49.962 --> 18:51.697
I'm only kidding.

18:51.797 --> 18:53.332
They're so cute, right?

18:53.432 --> 18:54.466
I mean, come on.

18:54.533 --> 18:57.169
Oh, nice. Yes.
Aww.

18:57.269 --> 18:58.270
Here you go.

18:58.337 --> 18:59.605
- Aww.
- Ooh, those cheeks!

18:59.671 --> 19:01.140
- Oh, Alma, they're adorable.
- Thank you.

19:01.206 --> 19:02.708
Looks like a sweet
little chipmunk!

19:02.808 --> 19:03.976
They're terrors.

19:04.042 --> 19:05.511
Well, it must be lovely
having the company

19:05.611 --> 19:06.879
of little ones again.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.514
To tell you the truth,
I'm far more interested

19:08.614 --> 19:10.048
in what you've been up to.

19:10.149 --> 19:12.684
Ohh. Me?

19:12.784 --> 19:14.853
Poppycock.

19:14.953 --> 19:16.121
You're a TV star!

19:16.188 --> 19:17.556
Hear, hear.
You were wonderful today.

19:17.656 --> 19:19.224
I wish I could
see your show.

19:19.324 --> 19:21.193
You'll have to find a way
to get it to air in New Jersey.

19:21.293 --> 19:25.063
I don't even know how I got it
to air in Boston.

19:25.164 --> 19:27.399
Good evening, ladies.

19:29.568 --> 19:31.036
Julia.

19:32.704 --> 19:34.406
Iris.

19:34.506 --> 19:36.575
Iris Wallace.

19:36.675 --> 19:41.046
Yes! Iris, of course!

19:41.146 --> 19:42.314
Join us.

19:42.381 --> 19:43.849
Have a glass of wine.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.870
- Brava!
- Encore! Encore!

20:04.937 --> 20:06.939
<i>- Molto bene!</i>
- Beautiful, beautiful!

20:07.039 --> 20:10.108
- Encore!

20:10.209 --> 20:11.610
Were we really ever
that young?

20:11.710 --> 20:13.712
Well, I know
I was never that short.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.380
I can hardly
remember it anymore.

20:15.447 --> 20:18.217
Well, then, at the same time,
it feels like it was yesterday.

20:18.283 --> 20:20.452
Everything seemed possible.

20:20.552 --> 20:22.854
Sounds stupid now,
but I was gonna go

20:22.921 --> 20:24.289
to New York
and conquer Broadway.

20:24.389 --> 20:26.792
I mean, we all knew
how exceptional we were.

20:26.892 --> 20:29.561
And then we just grew up
and became our parents.

20:32.030 --> 20:33.465
Except for Julia, that is.

20:33.565 --> 20:36.034
Oh, no, not this again.

20:36.101 --> 20:38.637
To Julia...

20:38.737 --> 20:42.374
for living the kind of life
we used to dream about.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.778
- To Julia!
- Julia!

21:04.830 --> 21:05.831
Hello?

21:05.931 --> 21:07.165
Hey, sweetheart.

21:07.266 --> 21:09.935
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry I'm late.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.436
Yeah.

21:11.503 --> 21:14.072
It<i> was</i> pretty good.

21:14.139 --> 21:17.976
Ah, just got distracted on set.

21:18.076 --> 21:20.178
Spanakopita?

21:20.279 --> 21:23.682
I'll grab a dozen in case
the craving lasts.

21:25.851 --> 21:28.654
Of course, honey.

21:28.754 --> 21:30.489
I love you, too.

21:30.589 --> 21:32.157
Okay.
Bye-bye.

21:49.841 --> 21:52.644
I love how contemplative
it feels in here tonight.

21:52.711 --> 21:53.979
That's one way to put it.

21:54.046 --> 21:55.981
How would you put it?

21:56.048 --> 21:58.550
The way things went yesterday,
I just thought...

22:00.218 --> 22:02.054
I don't know
what I thought.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.656
You're coming off a high.

22:04.723 --> 22:06.558
It's going very well.

22:09.194 --> 22:11.830
You sold three pieces
in two days.

22:12.831 --> 22:15.167
My sensei
bought the painting.

22:15.233 --> 22:18.904
And the other two
were photos of Julia.

22:19.004 --> 22:20.806
I feel like
an old fool.

22:22.674 --> 22:24.343
Oh.

22:24.409 --> 22:26.144
No one thinks you're old.

22:30.215 --> 22:32.584
This is what you wanted.

22:32.684 --> 22:35.754
The work is great.

22:35.854 --> 22:37.656
Just enjoy the ride.

22:39.758 --> 22:41.426
You know...

22:41.526 --> 22:45.564
the only painting
Van Gogh ever sold...

22:45.664 --> 22:48.433
was to his brother
when he was 30.

22:48.533 --> 22:49.668
See?

22:49.735 --> 22:52.003
Van Gogh never gave up.

22:52.070 --> 22:53.739
Well...

22:53.839 --> 22:55.340
he did, actually.

22:57.042 --> 22:59.845
I don't remember
a walk through campus

22:59.911 --> 23:01.046
winding me like this.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.682
That hill back there
was treacherous.

23:03.749 --> 23:06.885
Well, I must have gained
20 pounds

23:06.952 --> 23:09.121
since I last
walked the green.

23:09.221 --> 23:11.723
Ah.

23:11.790 --> 23:14.626
Please.

23:14.726 --> 23:17.729
Oh, Julia.

23:17.796 --> 23:19.798
It's so good to see you.

23:19.898 --> 23:22.968
When your cookbook came out,
it never occurred to me

23:23.068 --> 23:27.706
that Julia Child
was Julia McWilliams.

23:27.773 --> 23:30.108
Well, I would never have
guessed it, either.

23:30.208 --> 23:31.309
Oh.

23:31.410 --> 23:33.445
But then, one day,
I was in my kitchen,

23:33.545 --> 23:35.947
and I heard your voice
in my living room.

23:36.047 --> 23:38.150
It all came back to me.
My heart started pounding.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.486
I was beside myself.
I ran into the living room.

23:41.586 --> 23:44.289
And there you were,
on my television.

23:47.225 --> 23:49.261
Enough about me.

23:49.327 --> 23:51.229
Tell me about you.

23:51.296 --> 23:54.666
You haven't changed
your name.

23:54.766 --> 23:56.668
Are you married?

23:58.837 --> 24:00.672
Oh.

24:00.772 --> 24:02.441
I have someone.

24:02.507 --> 24:03.842
Oh, well,
that's wonderful.

24:05.677 --> 24:07.312
What does he do?

24:09.114 --> 24:10.182
Mm...

24:10.282 --> 24:11.783
not he.

24:13.251 --> 24:15.353
She. Carol.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.622
Ahh.

24:17.689 --> 24:18.857
And if it weren't
for you,

24:18.957 --> 24:21.960
I don't know
if I would have found her.

24:22.027 --> 24:24.830
It changed me,
being around you.

24:29.267 --> 24:31.503
Iris, I'm sorry.

24:31.603 --> 24:34.539
I'm so confused.

24:34.639 --> 24:36.875
What are
we talking about?

24:36.975 --> 24:39.044
Spring Break...

24:39.144 --> 24:40.445
our senior year.

24:40.512 --> 24:42.180
You must remember.

24:42.280 --> 24:45.217
We went to the house in Maine
with Charlotte

24:45.317 --> 24:46.952
and some of the other
basketball girls.

24:47.018 --> 24:49.054
We were drinking
by the lake,

24:49.154 --> 24:51.056
and that group
of Yale boys met us?

24:51.156 --> 24:52.290
Yes, yes.
That's right.

24:52.357 --> 24:55.460
We hung back,
and the girls went off.

24:55.527 --> 24:57.395
And we finished
the Beefeater

24:57.496 --> 25:01.032
and dared each other
to skinny-dip in the lake.

25:03.001 --> 25:04.970
Oh, my God!

25:05.036 --> 25:06.671
We -- it was freezing.

25:06.738 --> 25:09.374
We kept kicking each other
under the water.

25:09.474 --> 25:12.577
I-I just couldn't believe how
free and natural it all felt.

25:12.677 --> 25:17.148
Oh, well, yes, I remember
the skinny-dipping

25:17.215 --> 25:19.384
and the water being cold.

25:19.484 --> 25:21.987
And running
into the house and...

25:22.053 --> 25:25.690
falling asleep on the couch
under that big blanket,

25:25.757 --> 25:28.393
the -- uh,
with the tartan print.

25:28.493 --> 25:31.029
Red and -- and green,
I think.

25:31.096 --> 25:32.998
Reminded me of Christmas.

25:34.933 --> 25:36.835
Memory can be so fickle.

25:46.077 --> 25:47.245
Shall we?

26:23.715 --> 26:25.617
<i> Hello?</i>

26:25.717 --> 26:27.452
My Paul.

26:27.552 --> 26:29.054
<i>How are you?</i>
<i>How was the opening?</i>

26:29.120 --> 26:31.723
Eh... you --
you didn't miss much.

26:31.790 --> 26:33.491
The pre-opening was --
was better.

26:33.592 --> 26:36.828
You're just saying that to make
me feel better for missing it.

26:36.928 --> 26:38.229
<i>Someone bought</i>
<i>a photo of you.</i>

26:38.296 --> 26:40.665
Said they plan to hang it
in their kitchen.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.601
Oh, gosh.

26:42.667 --> 26:45.637
I don't know if I want to be
hanging in someone else's house.

26:45.737 --> 26:48.239
You're like the patron saint
of omelettes.

26:48.306 --> 26:49.574
<i>Oh, dear.</i>

26:49.641 --> 26:52.510
I really can't wait
to see you tomorrow.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.813
<i>Just you.</i>
<i>I miss you so much.</i>

26:54.913 --> 26:56.181
After 12 hours?

26:56.281 --> 26:57.616
<i>I know, it's silly.</i>

26:57.682 --> 26:59.584
Just not used to spending
the night away from you,

26:59.651 --> 27:01.252
I guess.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.155
I miss you too, kitten.

27:07.492 --> 27:09.027
Good morning!

27:09.127 --> 27:10.128
Hey, good morning!

27:10.195 --> 27:11.830
You're early.

27:11.930 --> 27:14.599
Yes, no traffic on Route 9
this morning.

27:14.666 --> 27:16.368
How was your trip?

27:16.468 --> 27:18.536
Thank you for asking,
Benny.

27:18.637 --> 27:21.840
Julia, uh,
we're not quite ready for you,

27:21.940 --> 27:23.508
but don't go far.

27:23.608 --> 27:24.542
Ah.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.211
I want to show her
the mirror shot.

27:26.311 --> 27:27.679
The mirror shot.

27:27.779 --> 27:29.447
Sounds so Hollywood.

27:31.483 --> 27:34.052
I've never known you to be
the first to leave a good party.

27:34.152 --> 27:36.488
Well, a --
a trip down memory lane

27:36.554 --> 27:40.492
is often better off a stroll
than a full-blown hike.

27:40.558 --> 27:44.229
Julia, we'd like
to show you something.

27:44.329 --> 27:46.031
Avis, hit it.

27:47.365 --> 27:48.633
Come on.

27:51.670 --> 27:53.738
Oh, my goodness.

27:58.476 --> 28:00.245
You're kidding me.

28:03.682 --> 28:06.885
Well, you old dog.

28:06.985 --> 28:09.387
This looks like a riff
on something you picked up

28:09.487 --> 28:12.190
in the honeymoon suite
at Niagara Falls.

28:13.892 --> 28:17.062
Oh, well done,
the two of you.

28:17.162 --> 28:18.930
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

28:19.030 --> 28:20.999
Uh, Julia, these letters
are for you.

28:21.066 --> 28:22.200
Oh, my goodness.

28:22.267 --> 28:24.202
You went from 27
to what, 200?

28:24.269 --> 28:25.670
More keep flooding in
every week.

28:25.737 --> 28:28.339
Really?
Oh, let's see.

28:30.275 --> 28:33.912
"Dear Mrs. Child,
you don't know me,

28:34.012 --> 28:37.515
but you were with me
at my engagement party last week

28:37.582 --> 28:39.617
through your
Queen of Sheba cake."

28:39.718 --> 28:42.721
Oh.

28:42.787 --> 28:45.957
I almost feel like you're part
of the family now.

28:46.057 --> 28:50.095
Next time, I'll leave
a slice at your doorstep.

28:50.195 --> 28:51.362
Love, Arlene."

28:51.429 --> 28:54.032
Well, isn't that
charming?

28:54.099 --> 28:55.734
Well, it is
a delicious cake,

28:55.800 --> 29:00.238
but perhaps I might start
locking my door at night.

29:00.305 --> 29:01.706
Thank you, Jen.

29:01.773 --> 29:03.441
I'll -- I'll pick them up from
the front on the way out.

29:03.541 --> 29:05.610
I'm ready, Russ.

29:05.710 --> 29:07.145
Great.

29:07.245 --> 29:08.646
I am, too.

29:10.381 --> 29:11.583
I'm sorry, dear.

29:11.649 --> 29:13.151
I know you see potential here,
but I --

29:13.251 --> 29:16.488
I just don't know
how many chicken recipes

29:16.588 --> 29:18.089
the American housewife
needs,

29:18.156 --> 29:20.158
or wants,
or will pay for.

29:20.258 --> 29:21.659
This is her first pass.

29:21.760 --> 29:24.763
I'll just let her know we need
more new ideas for Part 2.

29:24.829 --> 29:26.998
It's not just that.

29:27.098 --> 29:28.967
I-It's only selling
in Boston, and --

29:29.067 --> 29:31.770
and who really
cares about Boston?

29:31.836 --> 29:34.672
I know you love
this woman.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.174
But I just can't see how

29:36.274 --> 29:38.176
a second volume
works for us at this time.

29:38.276 --> 29:40.411
I'm sorry.
I really am.

29:40.478 --> 29:43.815
At least now you'll have time
for your more serious titles.

29:47.285 --> 29:49.187
I should get that.

29:49.287 --> 29:50.421
Oh.

29:54.793 --> 29:55.827
This is Judith.

29:55.927 --> 29:57.862
Judith, it's John.

29:57.962 --> 30:00.632
I'm here at WGBH,
and I must tell you --

30:00.698 --> 30:02.700
<i>I'm not gonna be the butt</i>
<i>of some joke here, am I?</i>

30:02.801 --> 30:05.170
John!
Not at all!

30:05.270 --> 30:06.871
I shouldn't have assumed
this place would reflect

30:06.971 --> 30:09.040
you personally,
but it's much heavier

30:09.140 --> 30:10.542
on the "public"
than the "television."

30:10.642 --> 30:13.878
Look, it's a small audience,
but a smart one.

30:13.978 --> 30:16.481
<i>Literate.</i>
<i>Intellectual. Academic.</i>

30:16.548 --> 30:19.350
I have to be honest, Judith.
I'm having second thoughts.

30:19.450 --> 30:22.854
Your notes were great,
but no notes are that great.

30:22.954 --> 30:24.489
Excuse me.
I don't mean to interrupt.

30:24.556 --> 30:27.292
I just wanted to say
how delightful it is to see you

30:27.358 --> 30:29.060
at our little station.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.395
A literary giant,

30:30.495 --> 30:32.630
<i>gracing our airwaves.</i>

30:32.697 --> 30:35.400
Professor Duhamel is
the Elvis of eggheads,

30:35.500 --> 30:38.703
and you will surely
be the jewel in his crown.

30:38.803 --> 30:40.972
All the Crimson kids are
going to worship you

30:41.039 --> 30:44.409
even more
than they already do.

30:44.509 --> 30:46.311
"He runs.

30:46.377 --> 30:49.848
runs.

30:49.914 --> 30:51.549
Runs."

30:54.018 --> 30:55.653
It's genius.

30:58.022 --> 30:59.724
You owe me one.

31:02.026 --> 31:03.928
Are the pillows
better now?

31:04.028 --> 31:06.898
Ahh.
They do look better.

31:06.998 --> 31:08.833
You should really consider
the benefits

31:08.900 --> 31:10.335
of fluffing them weekly!

31:10.401 --> 31:12.770
I'm on it.
I'm on it.

31:12.871 --> 31:15.073
Do the ferns
smell fake to you?

31:15.173 --> 31:16.608
What does a fake fern
smell like?

31:16.708 --> 31:18.076
Wrong answer.

31:18.176 --> 31:20.612
Get Marcia to spritz them
with some of that hair spray

31:20.712 --> 31:22.080
she uses
that smells so good.

31:22.180 --> 31:23.414
That stuff's flammable.

31:23.514 --> 31:24.616
Well, I'm doused in it!

31:24.716 --> 31:26.951
Oh, never mind
the hair spray.

31:27.051 --> 31:29.387
It's not that I haven't read
and taught "Rabbit, Run,"

31:29.454 --> 31:31.956
but I deserve some runway
to prepare for this.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.458
I had to act fast.

31:33.558 --> 31:36.561
And this seemed like too good
an opportunity to pass up.

31:36.628 --> 31:37.629
I'm sorry.
It won't happen again.

31:37.729 --> 31:39.297
No, no, no.
It's alright.

31:39.397 --> 31:42.066
But just remember you doubted
someone of Updike's caliber

31:42.133 --> 31:43.468
was within our grasp.

31:43.568 --> 31:45.536
And I hope you've learned
your lesson.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.640
Is this the right place?

31:48.740 --> 31:50.975
Oh. Hello, John.

31:52.243 --> 31:53.711
May I call you John?

31:53.778 --> 31:55.613
It's my name.

31:55.713 --> 31:57.282
You may call me Albert.

31:57.382 --> 31:59.150
You may also
call me Duke.

31:59.250 --> 32:01.119
It isn't my name.

32:02.820 --> 32:05.123
Oh, Julia!
Darling!

32:05.223 --> 32:06.391
Hello, Albert!

32:06.457 --> 32:08.326
Please meet
my distinguished guest.

32:08.426 --> 32:09.661
Oh, uh, we've --

32:09.761 --> 32:11.763
Julia, this is John Updike.

32:11.829 --> 32:13.665
And this is Julia Child,

32:13.765 --> 32:17.735
towering scribe of
"Mastering the French Chef."

32:17.802 --> 32:20.438
Hello, John.
Welcome to WGBH.

32:20.505 --> 32:22.974
Charmed.
Ladies, I am very sorry.

32:23.074 --> 32:24.442
I'm sure you'd love to stay
and chitchat,

32:24.509 --> 32:26.010
but it's really not
a good time for us.

32:26.110 --> 32:28.780
We're about to start,
and we need to focus.

32:28.846 --> 32:31.349
Yes, of course.
We'll get out of the way.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.318
John, it's been a pleasure.

32:40.258 --> 32:42.760
"Mastering
the French Chef."

32:42.827 --> 32:44.295
What a buffoon.

32:44.362 --> 32:48.299
And how did he<i> ever</i> land
John Updike?

32:48.366 --> 32:49.434
I have no idea.

32:49.500 --> 32:51.636
The way he presented him
to us,

32:51.703 --> 32:53.838
not that he even registered
I was there.

32:53.938 --> 32:57.208
He was like a sugared-up child
at show-and-tell.

32:57.308 --> 32:58.876
I practically wanted to
spit in my hand

32:58.977 --> 33:01.446
and wipe the chocolate
off his face.

33:01.512 --> 33:03.881
I thought it was sweet.

33:03.982 --> 33:07.218
It was many things,
but sweet it was not.

33:07.318 --> 33:10.154
Oh, I knew he'd be thrilled
with Updike.

33:10.221 --> 33:11.522
You're kidding.

33:11.622 --> 33:13.157
You sent him Updike?

33:13.224 --> 33:15.393
Well, not as far
as he knows.

33:15.493 --> 33:16.961
What happened to
"no idea"?

33:17.028 --> 33:19.063
Mm!

33:19.163 --> 33:20.498
You want to know
how I did it?

33:20.565 --> 33:23.901
No. I want to know
<i>why</i> you did it.

33:24.002 --> 33:27.005
When he's happy,
Hunter's happy.

33:27.071 --> 33:28.506
I get it.

33:28.573 --> 33:31.409
I spent the last week
doing the same thing for Paul.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.344
Boosting his ego
and massaging his pride

33:33.411 --> 33:36.647
so that you could get
your work done in peace.

33:36.714 --> 33:39.017
Men just need a little boost
sometimes.

33:39.083 --> 33:41.586
I find it terribly moving.

33:41.686 --> 33:45.356
Can't be easy having a woman
steal your shine.

33:45.423 --> 33:46.557
Ah!

33:46.657 --> 33:48.493
What shine
did you ever steal?

33:48.559 --> 33:49.827
That's<i> your</i> shine.

33:49.894 --> 33:52.430
Oh, Avis, come now.

33:52.530 --> 33:54.932
This tale goes back
to the Garden of Eden.

33:55.033 --> 33:57.235
It makes life spicy.

33:57.335 --> 34:00.071
I say,<i> vive la difference.</i>

34:00.171 --> 34:03.908
And besides, if he wants
the spotlight so badly,

34:04.008 --> 34:05.510
let him have it.

34:05.576 --> 34:07.045
I don't know.

34:07.111 --> 34:10.047
I just think about how many
more hours in the day we'd have

34:10.114 --> 34:12.784
if we didn't have to spend
so much of it

34:12.884 --> 34:16.387
apologizing to men
for your success.

34:16.454 --> 34:18.923
I'm not apologizing.

34:19.023 --> 34:22.293
Who said anything
about apologizing?

34:22.393 --> 34:23.795
Don't be so
black-and-white, Avis.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.129
It's unbecoming.

34:31.602 --> 34:33.971
Hello, and welcome to

34:34.072 --> 34:36.240
"I've Been Reading."

34:36.307 --> 34:38.609
Class is now in session.

34:38.709 --> 34:41.746
Well, I want to start
with a question about "Rabbit."

34:41.813 --> 34:44.315
I've read this book
three times now

34:44.415 --> 34:49.053
and find myself more struck
and challenged

34:49.120 --> 34:51.789
and enthralled by it
each time.

34:51.889 --> 34:56.994
Tell me what a writer --
in this case you,

34:57.094 --> 34:58.463
John Updike --

34:58.563 --> 35:01.833
feels when he flabbergasts
his readers time after time

35:01.933 --> 35:04.836
with what he thought
had been clear in the epigraph,

35:04.936 --> 35:08.739
which comes from Pascal's
"Pensées," I believe.

35:08.806 --> 35:14.078
Yes, "The motions of Grace,
the hardness of heart;

35:14.145 --> 35:16.414
external circumstances."

35:19.016 --> 35:20.918
Was there a question
in there?

35:22.253 --> 35:24.689
Oh, my God.

35:28.659 --> 35:31.429
Wh-Why do men jog?

35:31.496 --> 35:33.598
I mean,
should we start there?

35:35.700 --> 35:37.835
Why do men jog?

35:40.972 --> 35:42.773
Huh.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.978
It's simple,

35:47.044 --> 35:49.680
but I guess
I'd never really

35:49.780 --> 35:51.182
thought of it
that way before.

35:51.282 --> 35:52.817
You know,
come to think of it,

35:52.884 --> 35:56.988
I started jogging the first time
I struck out with a girl,

35:57.054 --> 36:01.893
and I still don't really
know where I'm headed.

36:01.993 --> 36:03.895
I-I see a connection.
I-I-I do.

36:03.995 --> 36:07.565
Well, between your novel
and Cheever's "The Swimmer,"

36:07.665 --> 36:10.067
I think one conclusion
is that men

36:10.168 --> 36:14.338
are aerobically compelled
to get away from their wives.

36:16.174 --> 36:18.176
Yes.

36:18.242 --> 36:20.378
Yes. Yes.

36:21.345 --> 36:22.246
Alice.

36:22.346 --> 36:23.514
Phone call for you.

36:23.581 --> 36:24.916
This is a live set.
I'll call them back.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.418
But it's long distance
from San Francisco.

36:32.723 --> 36:33.858
Excuse me.

36:40.031 --> 36:41.265
Whoa.

36:41.699 --> 36:43.834
- Oh! My.
- Oh!

36:43.901 --> 36:47.104
- Whoa! Heads up!
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.773
Hey, watch it!

36:48.873 --> 36:50.708
Where's the fire?

36:50.775 --> 36:52.677
- Sorry.
- Oh, geez!

36:54.212 --> 36:55.546
Oh, Alice,
Julia forgot her --

36:55.613 --> 36:57.181
I --

37:05.590 --> 37:08.626
This is Alice Naman
from "The French Chef."

37:11.395 --> 37:15.066
You're kidding.
I mean, that's wonderful!

37:18.869 --> 37:20.571
You did what?

37:21.906 --> 37:24.442
Wait.
So we make the episodes,

37:24.542 --> 37:26.777
and they pay us
for them?

37:30.748 --> 37:33.884
And which one of you fellas
came up with that idea?

37:38.889 --> 37:41.325
You sold "The French Chef"
to KQED

37:41.425 --> 37:43.995
without mentioning it to me --
or to anyone!

37:44.095 --> 37:45.830
You really shouldn't have
done that, Alice.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.398
Really.
That was<i> wrong</i> of you.

37:47.465 --> 37:50.234
And -- And what's more,
<i>how</i> did you do it?

37:50.301 --> 37:51.269
How?!

37:51.335 --> 37:52.770
Who did you say
you were?

37:52.837 --> 37:54.405
Do -- Do --
Do they know?

37:54.472 --> 37:58.442
Do they even know
who's running this place?

37:58.509 --> 38:00.244
There's a hierarchy here.

38:00.311 --> 38:02.513
An associate producer
should<i> never,</i>

38:02.613 --> 38:04.515
and I mean<i> never,</i>

38:04.615 --> 38:06.751
go behind everyone's back
like this.

38:06.817 --> 38:09.487
I just can't get my head
around it.

38:09.587 --> 38:12.023
And I'm angry!

38:12.123 --> 38:14.959
Truly, I am.
But also...

38:15.026 --> 38:16.627
I mean, you're gonna have to
walk me through this,

38:16.694 --> 38:17.862
man to man.

38:17.962 --> 38:23.034
Selling "The French Chef"
to other stations...

38:23.134 --> 38:24.201
The possibilities.

38:24.302 --> 38:27.438
This could be
a game-changer for us.

38:28.639 --> 38:30.107
Alice.

38:30.174 --> 38:32.376
Mm-hmm?

38:32.476 --> 38:36.047
Do you think
this could happen again?

38:37.648 --> 38:40.885
WGBH in San Francisco!

38:40.985 --> 38:42.720
Ooh! Whoo!

38:59.503 --> 39:00.905
Someone called the house
this morning

39:01.005 --> 39:03.240
saying they loved
my photographs.

39:03.341 --> 39:05.343
- That's nice.
- Mm.

39:05.409 --> 39:06.811
Do they want to buy one?

39:06.877 --> 39:10.915
No. They want me to shoot
their son's bar mitzvah.

39:11.015 --> 39:12.717
Oh.

39:14.919 --> 39:16.921
I learned something
this weekend.

39:17.021 --> 39:18.756
Something valuable.

39:18.856 --> 39:21.359
What's that?

39:21.425 --> 39:22.860
I'm a hobbyist.

39:22.927 --> 39:24.061
Oh, Paul.

39:24.161 --> 39:25.596
A skilled craftsman.

39:25.696 --> 39:30.835
And I'll keep doing this
so long as I enjoy it, but...

39:30.901 --> 39:34.438
I'm not the true artist
in this family.

39:34.538 --> 39:36.741
And for the record,
I couldn't be more invested

39:36.841 --> 39:38.743
in your rising star.

39:43.514 --> 39:46.951
I'm scared, Paul.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.620
It really isn't just
the jealousy --

39:49.720 --> 39:50.788
Albert and the like.

39:50.888 --> 39:53.457
It's...

39:53.557 --> 39:55.626
The adoration
can be hard, too.

39:59.897 --> 40:01.699
Listen to me.

40:01.766 --> 40:02.967
"Adoration."

40:03.067 --> 40:06.604
Mm.
I think it's apt.

40:06.704 --> 40:07.905
It's the strangest thing,

40:07.972 --> 40:10.708
people thinking
I belong to them somehow.

40:10.775 --> 40:12.910
They bake my cake and send me
a note about it.

40:12.977 --> 40:16.447
And it's lovely until
I really think about it,

40:16.547 --> 40:18.749
and then it's less lovely.

40:18.816 --> 40:20.384
They hear my voice on TV,

40:20.451 --> 40:23.053
and we end up spending
an entire evening

40:23.120 --> 40:25.456
talking about
what I mean to them.

40:27.591 --> 40:31.796
You're teaching Americans
how to taste life,

40:31.896 --> 40:34.298
and they're listening.

40:34.398 --> 40:36.300
That's goddamn huge.

40:39.303 --> 40:42.506
Well, it may be too huge.

40:42.606 --> 40:44.775
For me, at least.

40:44.842 --> 40:48.078
And I love doing my little show,
but the rest is --

40:48.145 --> 40:52.583
Ohh, it's not your little show
anymore, kitten.

40:52.650 --> 40:55.519
Now it's Boston's
little show.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.855
And that's what we wanted,
wasn't it?

41:04.195 --> 41:06.263
It's so beautiful, Paul.
