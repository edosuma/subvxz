00:47.400 --> 00:50.920
Please, let me go home. Please,
I'm not who you think I am.

00:50.960 --> 00:52.720
I am really not who you think I am.

00:54.320 --> 00:57.440
- Please, please, I'm not a spy.
- You are a spy.

00:57.480 --> 00:59.280
Please let me go home.

00:59.280 --> 01:00.880
Try again.

01:00.880 --> 01:02.440
I am not a spy, I am a businesswoman.

01:02.440 --> 01:04.480
I work in the sale
of petroleum and gas.

01:07.520 --> 01:10.920
You are here to sabotage
our nuclear ambition.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.680
I'm not a spy. I'm not a spy.

01:12.680 --> 01:14.280
I'm not a spy.

01:29.840 --> 01:33.200
I am not a spy. I am not a spy.

01:51.360 --> 01:54.800
Keep your head down and don't
say anything until we make the the swap.

01:55.160 --> 01:57.840
In case Kim Jong here changes his mind.

02:11.920 --> 02:13.120
Exchange.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.240
I don't understand.

02:23.240 --> 02:25.200
You don't understand what?

02:27.520 --> 02:32.080
All the rules say to leave me, that one
life is not worth blowing operational cover.

02:32.640 --> 02:34.360
You got that right.

02:34.360 --> 02:36.520
If we have to lose someone
for the greater good.

02:36.560 --> 02:38.160
We will.

02:38.200 --> 02:39.640
So why did you do it?

02:40.120 --> 02:41.240
Well...

02:41.240 --> 02:42.480
I didn't do it.

02:43.840 --> 02:45.120
He did.

02:47.120 --> 02:49.880
Once he found out where you were,
there was no stopping him.

02:51.360 --> 02:53.120
He petitioned the Senate...

02:54.440 --> 02:55.920
State department...

02:55.960 --> 02:57.880
We didn't need the publicity, so I
figured we better do something or

02:57.900 --> 02:59.980
he's gonna invade this
God damn Republic himself.

03:17.900 --> 03:21.980
- You okay?
- Yeah.

04:04.440 --> 04:05.560
Hey.

04:07.480 --> 04:09.600
- Good Morning.
- Happy Anniversary.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.480
You want me to make you breakfast?

04:13.480 --> 04:16.120
How about pancakes?

04:16.160 --> 04:17.279
You're cooking?

04:18.600 --> 04:20.440
You're joking, you like my cooking.

04:20.519 --> 04:22.960
Germans don't joke.

04:23.560 --> 04:25.680
Bert likes my cooking.

04:32.480 --> 04:34.240
Get your bugs off the table.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.120
- They're spiders.
- They're bugs.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.000
- Spiders.
- They're bugs.

04:59.200 --> 05:02.360
Are you doing this on company time?

05:04.080 --> 05:07.560
It's my anniversary and
I want it to be perfect.

05:08.520 --> 05:10.120
But...

05:10.560 --> 05:12.480
that is not sexy.

05:12.480 --> 05:17.000
No, but it is utilitarian and
utilitarian is the new sexy.

05:17.680 --> 05:20.760
Ran the trace, first name
Usem, last name Utsa.

05:20.760 --> 05:22.480
- Any verifiable hits?
- Only one.

05:22.480 --> 05:23.480
Francis, do me a favor...

05:23.480 --> 05:24.920
stick it in the safe till tomorrow.

05:25.520 --> 05:29.920
- Matahari here's got a big night tonight.
- Yes sir, Right away Sir.

05:30.800 --> 05:31.800
Sir?

05:31.900 --> 05:33.640
Do I look like a, "Sir" to you?

05:33.740 --> 05:34.440
From head to toe.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.200
I'm surprised he didn't
call you "Your Majesty".

05:37.480 --> 05:39.920
I like the ring of that.

05:40.020 --> 05:42.400
I think I prefer "Your Majesty".

05:43.020 --> 05:45.440
Was I ever that young?

05:47.080 --> 05:50.280
Younger.
Walk me out.

05:51.880 --> 05:53.640
How did the Oval Office briefing go?

05:53.640 --> 05:55.680
You know, the usual.

05:56.080 --> 05:59.320
The President wants to know what's
happening in Russia the day before it happens.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.720
What about you?
I heard that interview went well.

06:01.720 --> 06:03.400
Hm... Fingers crossed

06:03.920 --> 06:05.680
Are you sure about this?

06:06.760 --> 06:08.880
Once you start pushing papers,
there's no turning back.

06:09.640 --> 06:12.320
I had the strangest feeling
when I was out last time.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.080
I was homesick.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.280
Homesick?

06:15.600 --> 06:17.280
Sir... Sir...

06:19.560 --> 06:21.000
We got a walk-in...

06:21.040 --> 06:22.440
A defector, 10 minutes ago.

06:22.440 --> 06:24.560
- Here?
- Guess he's not buying our cover.

06:24.560 --> 06:26.960
- You get his bona-fides?
- He's Russian.

06:26.960 --> 06:28.960
He says he's FSB, but
won't give us any more.

06:29.360 --> 06:31.080
- He's a strange guy.
- How's his English?

06:31.720 --> 06:33.120
Passable, not great.

06:33.600 --> 06:38.040
- But if we got down to the subtleties of English...
- Ted, Mike's gonna be waiting for me at home.

06:38.040 --> 06:39.440
Yeah, and I got a plane to catch.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.200
Come on Salt, no one can sort
out a nut job from the real thing faster than you.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.760
- I got 25 minutes.
- I got 26. Let's go.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.760
Yeah, okay. We'll
decide when we know more.

06:56.000 --> 06:58.360
- Who called Counter-Intelligence?
- Not me.

06:58.480 --> 07:00.280
Hey, Ted. We're crashing the party.

07:02.800 --> 07:04.600
- Peabody.
- Salt.

07:09.440 --> 07:10.920
Please remove the hood.

07:12.600 --> 07:13.760
Microphones are on.

07:14.120 --> 07:15.600
Checking levels.

07:17.640 --> 07:18.800
Baseline recording.

07:23.120 --> 07:26.640
Neuro-scan is up. Ready to go.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.640
Commencing audio and visual recording.

07:40.120 --> 07:42.640
Testing ear piece.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.360
Interview has commenced at 14:42.

07:56.400 --> 07:58.000
You're married.

07:59.360 --> 08:05.880
A husband must be a distraction
for a female intelligence officer.

08:05.880 --> 08:08.520
Well, we're here to talk about you.

08:08.520 --> 08:09.960
So what is your name?

08:11.120 --> 08:17.440
My name is Alec Vassilly Orlov.

08:20.760 --> 08:22.200
I have cancer.

08:23.080 --> 08:24.080
I'm moved.

08:24.520 --> 08:30.880
A defector with cancer. Are you selling secrets for
chemo or are you afraid of dying?

08:30.920 --> 08:41.120
If I have gained anything by damming myself,
it is that I no longer have anything to fear.

08:45.840 --> 08:48.560
- Russia is also dying.
- Alec Vassilly Orlov.

08:48.560 --> 08:52.520
Shows up in 1993 in
Novosibirsk blast, Siberia.

08:52.520 --> 08:56.360
He's on Victor Rasovsky's staff there.
He checks out as FSB.

08:56.360 --> 08:59.000
The scan says he's
truthful on the cancer.

08:59.000 --> 09:00.680
Prior to '93...

09:02.760 --> 09:04.040
Nothing...

09:04.040 --> 09:05.520
He doesn't exist.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.880
I have somewhere I
need to be, Mr. Orlov

09:13.880 --> 09:16.360
So if you wouldn't
mind getting to the point.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.880
In English please.
Others are listening.

09:33.800 --> 09:37.680
1975, The Cold War.

09:39.760 --> 09:48.000
In a gymnasium, a Soviet Olympic
wrestler named Sacha Jordorovich,

09:48.440 --> 09:49.960
meets for the first time,

09:49.960 --> 09:54.320
the only female
Chess Grandmaster of her era.

09:58.840 --> 10:02.080
Within a month they were married.

10:02.080 --> 10:05.080
And within a year, a child.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.120
One month more,

10:08.040 --> 10:11.360
the child was back
in the same hospital,

10:11.880 --> 10:13.400
sick with fever.

10:15.960 --> 10:20.920
And within days after that,
the child, suddenly was dead.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.880
Yes,

10:24.880 --> 10:26.720
a child was dead...

10:27.600 --> 10:28.720
and yes,

10:29.240 --> 10:30.800
a child was buried.

10:37.920 --> 10:41.480
But the Chenkov baby was still alive.

10:41.480 --> 10:45.880
And became the property of another man.

10:46.240 --> 10:54.640
A master spy who had devised the greatest
plan a Russian patriot could ever invent...

10:54.640 --> 10:58.400
A plan to destroy America.

11:00.040 --> 11:05.840
It had all started with an
American named Lee Harvey Oswald.

11:05.880 --> 11:07.560
In 1959,

11:07.600 --> 11:09.560
he emigrated to Russia.

11:09.560 --> 11:11.320
Three years later,

11:11.320 --> 11:18.720
he returned home. But, the man who
came back to America, was in fact a Russian spy...

11:18.720 --> 11:20.480
named Alec.

11:20.880 --> 11:24.920
On November 22, 1963,

11:24.920 --> 11:29.240
Alec became the first
success of the new program

11:29.240 --> 11:32.160
and a hero of the Soviet Union.

11:32.960 --> 11:38.640
The spy master was now given
the go ahead, to create many more like Alec.

11:39.200 --> 11:41.080
Scores of agents.

11:41.080 --> 11:42.840
Males and females

11:42.840 --> 11:45.400
to be substituted for Americans.

11:49.400 --> 11:53.360
At an abandoned monastery,
Chenkov and other boys

11:53.400 --> 11:57.360
and girls learned English long
before they learned Russian.

11:57.360 --> 12:01.320
Drilled in idiom, idiosyncrasy.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.400
And ideology.

12:05.360 --> 12:10.360
And by methods of rigorous
physical and psychological programming.

12:10.360 --> 12:13.240
The spy master made warriors of iron.

12:13.240 --> 12:17.040
Unquestioned and unbreakable.

12:17.640 --> 12:19.000
You're killing me, man.

12:20.720 --> 12:22.360
When does the good fairy come in?

12:22.360 --> 12:23.600
Never...

12:24.440 --> 12:26.160
It's a story without hope.

12:26.640 --> 12:30.920
Chenkov was matched with a child
of a visiting American family.

12:30.920 --> 12:38.040
There was an accident, the family died.
Chenkov was sent to America,

12:38.080 --> 12:40.680
to live a complete lie...

12:41.240 --> 12:46.360
and to patiently await the
day to attack from within, day X.

12:46.760 --> 12:51.000
The long awaited mission is here.

12:52.160 --> 12:59.360
Chenkov will travel to your
city to kill the President of Russia,

12:59.800 --> 13:10.320
at the funeral of the
American Vice President. Chenkov is KA12.

13:10.320 --> 13:11.600
KA12?

13:11.640 --> 13:13.080
It's an urban legend.

13:13.120 --> 13:18.120
Highly trained Russian sleeper agents,
inserted into American society to sabotage and assassinate.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.720
supposedly, they’d wait years to strike.
Decades even.

13:22.680 --> 13:23.800
Hmm... Supposedly.

13:24.680 --> 13:26.120
What's the matter, Ted?
You don't believe in moles?

13:26.160 --> 13:29.000
I believe in moles, alright.
Just not the boogey man.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.960
Specially if the plan is to
kill their own president.

13:31.960 --> 13:33.560
This guy's selling smoke.

13:34.000 --> 13:36.240
Wrap it up, Eve.

13:36.920 --> 13:40.640
So a Russian agent is gonna kill
the Russian president. Is that it?

13:42.880 --> 13:43.680
- Hmm...
- Okay.

13:44.240 --> 13:45.280
Thank you very much

13:45.680 --> 13:49.200
and what would you like in
return for that information?

13:49.680 --> 13:54.280
I simply wish to help you
do what you need to do.

13:57.120 --> 13:58.560
You're good.

14:00.320 --> 14:04.080
KA-program is brilliant bull-shit,

14:05.240 --> 14:07.160
but I'm officially off-duty,

14:07.160 --> 14:10.680
so you can tell the rest of your
little story to one of my colleagues.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.080
- Salt.
- Yes.

14:13.520 --> 14:19.440
The name of the
Russian agent is, Salt. Evelyn Salt.

14:23.200 --> 14:24.280
My name is Evelyn Salt.

14:25.760 --> 14:28.240
Then you are a Russian spy.

14:29.720 --> 14:30.560
<i>Truthful.</i>

14:30.920 --> 14:35.800
So far, the FMRI has registered
truthful on everything he said.

14:39.560 --> 14:41.320
Ted.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.000
Call Protective Services and
make sure they find my husband.

14:49.000 --> 14:50.400
- Where are you going?
- I need to get to the phone.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.120
No, no. Not after the neuro-scan.

14:52.120 --> 14:54.200
'Cause he didn't flutter?
I can beat that thing five

14:54.220 --> 14:56.200
times out of six. I am
trained to and so is he.

14:57.040 --> 14:58.840
I need my phone, I need to call my husband.

14:59.720 --> 15:01.520
- Let me call my husband.
- Let me see it.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.880
There is a reason he
mentioned my wedding ring Ted.

15:08.320 --> 15:10.360
When they blow up a spy,
they don't just blow

15:10.370 --> 15:13.360
up their cover, they blow up their
whole covered life, you know that.

15:13.370 --> 15:14.440
- Yeah.
- Do you remember what happened to Henry's wife?

15:14.440 --> 15:17.400
- Yes, I do.
- Speak.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.800
"Please leave a message
after the tone. Thanks, Bye".

15:20.800 --> 15:22.920
Honey, it's me.
Please call me as soon as you get this.

15:23.560 --> 15:25.480
Okay sweetheart? As soon as you get this.

15:25.480 --> 15:28.360
Godspeed, comrade Chenkov.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.600
Someone interrogate
that piece of shit.

15:30.600 --> 15:32.240
Someone who enjoys getting answers.

15:33.480 --> 15:35.640
Look Eve, try to stay calm...

15:35.640 --> 15:37.360
I'm not a goddamn Russia spy.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.720
I didn't say you were.

15:39.520 --> 15:41.280
Let's go up to my office
so we can sort this out.

15:41.280 --> 15:43.160
No, no. We gotta go to a secure location.

15:43.160 --> 15:45.780
- Now.
- Alright.

15:45.760 --> 15:48.320
Doesn't get anymore secure than this.

15:48.840 --> 15:50.200
Eve?

15:50.200 --> 15:51.320
Five minutes.

15:52.920 --> 15:55.920
Call Protective Services and
tell them to find Mike.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.920
This is bullshit.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.200
Give us a sec.

16:05.720 --> 16:09.600
I know that we're heading into your jurisdiction here,
but I'm asking you for just 5 minutes.

16:09.600 --> 16:11.320
No.

16:16.400 --> 16:19.320
If I have to yes, you can't have
five minutes alone with her. I have to talk with her

16:19.320 --> 16:21.080
- She's scared?
- I don't care.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.320
There's a mole in
Russia house Ted.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.320
There's a mole in
Russia house and I am sure...

16:37.400 --> 16:39.840
Please step in the elevator.

17:13.040 --> 17:14.760
What the hell is that?

17:15.480 --> 17:16.560
Sir.

17:53.120 --> 17:54.240
Jesus Chirst.

17:54.240 --> 17:57.560
- There he is again.
- No sign of him so far on the street.

17:58.480 --> 18:00.920
Two minutes to go before we lock down.

18:00.920 --> 18:02.280
We just got a match, Sir.

18:03.320 --> 18:07.560
- In 1981, there's Bresnov and there...
- Orlov.

18:07.560 --> 18:10.760
- That's him.
- Used to be a heavyweight once upon a time.

18:10.880 --> 18:13.320
Get that photo out now. Every ticket counter

18:13.880 --> 18:16.320
airport, train station and taxi
station, the whole nine yards.

18:16.320 --> 18:18.720
- Get me director Medford on a secure line, now.
- Yes, Sir.

18:19.720 --> 18:22.920
- Top-right screen, is that live?
- Yes sir.

18:22.920 --> 18:24.640
- Where is she going?
- Track her.

18:29.400 --> 18:31.000
Rink Petroleum Security.

18:31.000 --> 18:33.200
You have a woman to your left behind you.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.560
Evelyn Salt.

18:36.320 --> 18:38.520
- We lost visual of her.
- Damn.

18:38.520 --> 18:39.880
Where'd she go?

18:43.320 --> 18:45.600
Hey, Edward. Is Mike there?

18:45.600 --> 18:47.360
No, I'm sorry. He left after lunch.

18:49.520 --> 18:52.600
Stairwell, second floor.

18:52.600 --> 18:53.840
What's on that floor?

18:53.840 --> 18:55.760
It's empty. Security buffer.

18:55.770 --> 18:57.480
Isolate and seal it.

19:03.760 --> 19:05.480
Get her records to my hand-held.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.200
Kill the power to the elevator doors.

19:32.520 --> 19:33.200
We got her.

19:40.720 --> 19:41.920
Alright.

19:41.920 --> 19:43.760
Get a tactical team to meet
me on the south stairwell.

19:43.960 --> 19:45.240
Yes, Sir.

19:45.400 --> 19:47.900
- Director Medford, Sir.
- Get me a side-arm.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.120
I'll call her back.

19:56.200 --> 19:58.320
- Shit.
- I lost visual.

19:59.960 --> 20:01.680
Where is she Albert. Talk to me.

20:02.240 --> 20:03.280
Come on.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.280
North hallway.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.640
There, interrogation room. Bring it up.

21:14.520 --> 21:16.640
- Have you found him?
- What the hell are you doing Eve?

21:16.650 --> 21:18.640
This don't look good.

21:20.640 --> 21:23.360
There's a tac team coming
at you in 30 seconds. Get your goddamn

21:23.370 --> 21:26.360
panties off the camera. Get where we
can see you. So you don't get hurt.

21:26.360 --> 21:27.720
Have you found my husband?

21:27.720 --> 21:30.400
These boys don't fool around, Eve.

21:34.080 --> 21:38.000
- Please, I can't help you unless you talk to me.
- Call me when you find Mike.

21:57.200 --> 22:00.480
Okay, open the doors, about two feet.
We're gonna gas her.

22:02.240 --> 22:03.720
Is that absolutely necessary?

22:03.760 --> 22:05.040
Want, do you want me to shoot her?

22:05.840 --> 22:07.360
Get a medical team in place now.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.120
Okay, on my count.

22:36.200 --> 22:38.120
3, 2, 1...

22:38.840 --> 22:39.900
Go.

22:46.240 --> 22:47.320
Jesus Christ.

23:00.480 --> 23:02.040
Where is she?

23:02.200 --> 23:05.480
Come on, guys. Find her, now.

23:06.960 --> 23:09.200
There. Bring that up.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.400
Stay with her. She's crossing the street.

23:14.000 --> 23:15.520
Pan the god-damned camera.

23:26.800 --> 23:28.120
Back that up and zoom in.

23:30.000 --> 23:30.760
Freeze.

23:34.160 --> 23:35.320
What the hell are you doing, Eve?

23:41.240 --> 23:43.560
Michael Krauss left his office an hour ago.

23:43.560 --> 23:45.320
Salt's apartment is 20 minutes from here.

23:45.920 --> 23:47.480
We can cover it, but she won't go there.

23:47.480 --> 23:49.240
She will if she's serious about Mike.

23:49.680 --> 23:51.080
This stays in the house, okay?

23:52.200 --> 23:52.880
Taxi.

23:56.880 --> 23:59.400
Hugh's street. I'll tell you where to stop.

24:06.760 --> 24:09.480
"Hi, this is Mike. Please
leave a message after the tone".

24:35.600 --> 24:37.960
He's one of the world's
top arachnologists, Eve.

24:37.960 --> 24:42.760
And as such, enjoys pretty much unrestricted
access to the borders of North Korea.

24:43.880 --> 24:44.960
So,

24:44.960 --> 24:46.920
brush up on your
bugs and get to know him.

24:48.880 --> 24:50.800
He's the perfect cover to get us inside.

25:29.680 --> 25:30.600
Mike?

25:33.560 --> 25:34.440
Mike?

25:34.760 --> 25:35.920
Honey?

25:42.240 --> 25:43.880
Hey baby. Come here.

25:44.040 --> 25:45.880
It's alright.

25:46.640 --> 25:47.760
It's okay. Where's daddy?

25:48.440 --> 25:49.520
Where's daddy?

26:46.680 --> 26:47.480
Go! Go!

26:52.440 --> 26:53.520
Bathroom, clear.

26:55.360 --> 26:56.680
Kitchen, clear.

26:58.760 --> 27:00.160
Office, clear.

27:01.800 --> 27:03.000
Living room, clear.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.640
Everybody out in 60 seconds.

28:00.480 --> 28:02.600
What are you doing?

28:02.600 --> 28:05.000
She's not here and no sign
of the husband either.

28:05.000 --> 28:07.360
Did it ever occur to you that
maybe that Russian was lying?

28:07.360 --> 28:10.440
I don't know, cause you
were gonna lock her up.

28:07.361 --> 28:08.361
Why'd she run?

28:10.440 --> 28:13.280
See it from her perspective.
Maybe her husband is in some real danger.

28:13.280 --> 28:16.120
Maybe, God forbid,
Salt is who she says she is.

28:16.640 --> 28:20.440
"Maybe", is your department.
Mine is catching her, so we can find out.

28:20.960 --> 28:23.880
We bring her in, or we bring her down.

28:24.272 --> 28:25.934
Do you have any idea who this woman is?

28:26.629 --> 28:28.711
What she's done for this country.
Doesn't that mean anything to you?

28:29.490 --> 28:31.266
Should it?

28:32.490 --> 28:35.266
- Is your mom home?
- No.

28:36.140 --> 28:37.060
- Can you do me a favor?
- Yeah.

28:37.876 --> 28:40.129
- Can you baby-sit Bert for me?
- Yeah.

28:41.343 --> 28:43.116
Here's some money for the food.

28:45.382 --> 28:46.718
Did you do your homework?

28:46.736 --> 28:47.892
Yeah, Math.

28:51.216 --> 28:51.939
I hate math.

29:04.056 --> 29:04.608
Hi.

29:04.934 --> 29:05.836
It's nice to see you again.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.800
- Are you talking to me?
- Yeah, I've seen you here before.

29:11.960 --> 29:13.400
Yeah, I do. I come here a lot.

29:14.960 --> 29:16.160
And you?

29:16.880 --> 29:20.560
No, I'm working here at the museum.

29:21.800 --> 29:23.320
I'm an arachnologist.

29:24.160 --> 29:25.600
A what?

29:25.600 --> 29:27.440
I hunt spiders.

29:41.480 --> 29:42.400
I got her.

29:42.800 --> 29:44.840
She's heading north
toward the metro-station.

29:46.800 --> 29:47.940
Eve..?

30:21.680 --> 30:23.240
She's east-bound in the mall.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.320
There she is.

30:44.280 --> 30:45.840
All teams south-bound toward the bridge.

30:45.840 --> 30:47.640
Box her in.

30:58.960 --> 30:59.840
Stop!

31:00.200 --> 31:00.880
Stop!

31:02.700 --> 31:03.880
Fuck!

31:08.480 --> 31:10.120
Take it back. Hold your fire.

31:11.880 --> 31:12.880
Stop!

31:14.040 --> 31:15.080
Salt!

31:24.040 --> 31:26.560
Don't shoot. Don't shoot, I'm innocent.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.000
On the ground, now.

31:28.000 --> 31:28.760
Just don't shoot.

31:28.760 --> 31:31.360
Salt, on the ground.

31:31.360 --> 31:33.480
- I have to find my husband
- why'd you run?

31:33.480 --> 31:35.400
- To find my husband
- For what reason?

31:35.400 --> 31:36.600
Don't shoot.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.080
- Stay back.
- Last chance.

31:38.080 --> 31:40.640
I'm innocent,
somebody is setting me up.

31:40.680 --> 31:42.580
- Don't make me put you down, Salt.
- Put the god-damn gun down.

31:42.620 --> 31:44.200
- Give yourself up, now!
- No.

31:44.320 --> 31:46.040
On the ground.

31:46.640 --> 31:47.960
We'll sort this out, I promise.

31:48.560 --> 31:49.920
We gotta bring you in Salt.

31:49.920 --> 31:52.440
Someone is gonna try to kill
the Russian president, you know that.

31:52.440 --> 31:53.680
Do something about that.

31:53.680 --> 31:55.520
- Give yourself up.
- That's what you should be worried about.

31:55.560 --> 31:57.560
There's nowhere to run.

31:57.880 --> 31:59.720
I didn't do anything.

32:07.640 --> 32:10.240
She's on a blue semi,
route one, heading north.

32:10.760 --> 32:12.240
Get a roadblock in place now.

33:02.280 --> 33:05.720
There she is. On the tanker.

33:06.520 --> 33:07.960
Stop! Stop!

33:17.920 --> 33:18.840
Ev..!

33:35.160 --> 33:38.560
- You, my friend, have got a mole in your group.
- We don't know that yet.

33:39.160 --> 33:41.040
Actually, she's a
trained god damned liar.

33:41.060 --> 33:43.040
Everything she's done up
until now, is to protect her cover.

33:43.080 --> 33:46.840
Why don't you tell me
how you really feel about it.

34:33.800 --> 34:35.560
Get off on the shoulder!
Get off on the shoulder!

34:54.920 --> 34:56.980
Okay, take it down.

35:06.400 --> 35:08.280
Shit.

35:10.320 --> 35:12.480
Shit.

35:18.200 --> 35:19.040
Okay.

35:19.480 --> 35:20.760
Ted, I know you're her friend,

35:22.280 --> 35:24.160
but we gotta drop a net on New York.

35:24.640 --> 35:25.960
We gotta do it now.

35:29.280 --> 35:32.680
I'll notify the
Secret Service on the details.

35:34.640 --> 35:36.940
Tell 'em Salt might be coming their way.

35:38.080 --> 35:40.360
Here she is.

35:40.680 --> 35:42.560
Orlov may not be far behind either.

35:44.560 --> 35:45.940
You see this?

35:45.949 --> 35:47.280
Salt spent time in Russia
when she was a kid.

35:47.760 --> 35:51.720
She was in the car accident with
her parents in '88, they both died.

35:54.640 --> 35:58.360
They were teachers at the U.S Embassy
for the American children of the staff there.

35:59.600 --> 36:01.400
That's why we put her on
Russia in the first place.

36:03.840 --> 36:06.580
We need to get on a plan
to New York. Tonight.

37:21.720 --> 37:22.880
Evelyn.

37:23.360 --> 37:24.560
Look at me.

37:27.200 --> 37:29.120
If there was a way, I would kill them.

37:32.480 --> 37:36.000
- You shouldn't have come here
- What do you mean? I don't understand.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.320
Now they know who you are.

37:40.720 --> 37:42.080
Who?

37:43.480 --> 37:44.640
Evelyn.

37:46.320 --> 37:47.280
Who?

37:50.240 --> 37:53.840
I would accept anything about you,
but I need to know.

37:54.400 --> 37:56.600
Look at me. Look at me.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.200
Just tell me, okay?

38:02.320 --> 38:03.440
Just tell me.

38:05.600 --> 38:06.720
I work...

38:08.480 --> 38:10.320
I work for the CIA.

38:12.800 --> 38:13.960
You see, this...?

38:15.320 --> 38:17.200
There is no future for us.

38:20.560 --> 38:23.160
You're not safe with me.

38:24.440 --> 38:25.880
I don't want to be safe.

38:28.720 --> 38:30.120
I know you...

38:30.960 --> 38:32.720
and I want to be with you.

38:34.720 --> 38:37.480
I want to spend the
rest of my life with you.

38:39.520 --> 38:40.600
Okay?

38:42.760 --> 38:43.480
Okay.

39:04.800 --> 39:07.760
Welcome to New York
Ms. Hernandez. One night?

39:07.760 --> 39:09.240
- A deluxe room.
- Yeah.

39:09.240 --> 39:12.680
- Ms. Hernandez, do you need any help with your luggage?
- No, I got it. Thanks.

40:53.920 --> 40:55.800
<i>A full day here in New York City.</i>

40:56.640 --> 40:59.160
<i>The funeral of Vice-President Maxwell Oates.</i>

40:59.160 --> 41:03.000
<i>A former five term
U.S Senator and Cold War warrior.</i>

41:03.000 --> 41:08.000
<i>He's based legacy may be as architect of
the new era of Russian, American relations.</i>

41:08.640 --> 41:13.080
<i>Russian President Boris Matveyev has
joined from Moscow to be an</i>

41:13.080 --> 41:16.880
<i>honorary forbearer of the man who's
called, "his greatest friend in the West".</i>

42:13.440 --> 42:15.120
What's the security perimeter?

42:15.600 --> 42:18.280
We're too deep inside and we
own this entire block.

42:19.000 --> 42:20.880
And those are secret service agents.

42:20.920 --> 42:22.960
Not CIA. So, relax.

42:23.600 --> 42:25.000
That's real funny.

42:25.640 --> 42:28.440
Didn't know you guys told jokes.

43:15.480 --> 43:17.920
Step back! Step back!
Everybody, move away.

43:58.040 --> 44:00.360
Mr. President.

44:18.040 --> 44:20.360
Please be seated.

44:46.560 --> 44:51.360
After the President finishes
the chorus and the eulogy...

44:51.960 --> 44:54.280
If she's gonna try anything here,
it'll have to be pretty amazing.

44:59.280 --> 45:03.800
<i>I knew he would bring more to
the job than just his years of experience.</i>

45:03.980 --> 45:05.400
<i>As Vice-President...</i>

45:05.840 --> 45:09.240
<i>he showed the world best, of what
it is to be an American.</i>

45:10.680 --> 45:15.560
<i>And today, the world says,
"Goodbye" to a great man</i>

45:25.400 --> 45:28.560
- I'll take the back.
- Lower floor, clear.

46:04.400 --> 46:06.560
We got two, M.I.A's.

46:11.640 --> 46:14.520
I'm heading down to the crypt, some
kind of trouble down there.

46:14.920 --> 46:17.320
What's going on, guys?
Talk to me.

46:17.340 --> 46:20.520
All teams converge in the crypt.
I repeat, converge in the crypt.

46:20.880 --> 46:25.360
<i>He made all the difference and for that,
he will always have my respect and admiration.</i>

47:33.680 --> 47:36.880
Matveyev!
Get god-damn Matveyev!

48:30.680 --> 48:32.880
Drop it.

48:34.280 --> 48:36.600
Drop it.

48:47.497 --> 48:48.336
Shooters at twelve o'clock.

48:50.983 --> 48:52.406
Don't move.

48:54.628 --> 48:56.694
Take her down! Take her down!

48:56.696 --> 48:58.378
Check for other weapons

48:58.977 --> 49:00.677
We need a medical crew
in the crypt immediately.

49:00.975 --> 49:01.606
I can't feel a pulse.

49:16.280 --> 49:17.920
Why?

49:20.800 --> 49:22.280
Do you have any idea how
much blood is on your hands?

49:23.000 --> 49:26.980
You're gonna rot in a hole, Salt.
I'm gonna see to it personally. A god-damn hole.

49:30.320 --> 49:34.920
Back off! Back off!
Let's go!

49:52.000 --> 49:54.600
Matveyev was declared
dead en route to the hospital.

49:55.400 --> 49:57.040
Jesus Christ.

49:57.520 --> 49:58.520
Yeah.

49:58.680 --> 50:00.080
You were right about her.

50:02.000 --> 50:03.600
She had the drop on me, Ted.

50:05.320 --> 50:07.040
Why didn't she shoot?

50:58.520 --> 51:00.200
Cops down, cops down.

51:47.200 --> 51:50.400
<i>Get out of the car with
your hands on your head.</i>

51:52.400 --> 51:53.760
Hands in the air.

53:03.880 --> 53:07.440
- What is your name?
- My name is Evelyn Salt.

53:07.440 --> 53:09.120
- What college will you attend?
- Princeton University.

53:11.400 --> 53:14.360
- Where will you work?
- The Central Intelligence Agency.

53:14.360 --> 53:16.080
Who will you trust?

53:16.080 --> 53:17.400
No one.

53:17.800 --> 53:19.880
Be very patient.

53:20.320 --> 53:22.320
Remember your training.

53:23.040 --> 53:25.880
Remember, you're not the only one.

53:25.880 --> 53:27.480
There are many others...

53:28.120 --> 53:31.160
- all of you waiting to strike.
- Yes.

53:31.169 --> 53:35.360
- And we will strike... together.
- Yes.

53:39.680 --> 53:40.680
Wait.

53:43.480 --> 53:49.080
One day I will come for all of you.

53:53.160 --> 53:54.520
Hello Evelyn...

53:55.440 --> 53:57.960
I'm Martin Crenshaw, from the U.S. Embassy.

53:59.160 --> 54:01.400
We're very sorry about
your family's accident.

54:08.160 --> 54:13.400
Rioters outside the U.S embassy,
sheared their new leaders word in taking...

54:14.160 --> 54:18.400
strong action against what they are calling,
"A state sponsored act of terrorism."

54:18.460 --> 54:19.800
on this part of the U.S.

54:20.460 --> 54:25.800
These rioters are starting similar outbreaks of
anti-American protests across Russia.

54:25.860 --> 54:28.800
"We will strike back", say's
the new Russian president.

54:28.810 --> 54:33.760
Angrily condemning today’s assassination,
by American intelligence officer Evelyn Salt.

54:34.960 --> 54:38.360
Even as the body of slain
President Matveyev is on it's way back to Moscow,

54:38.960 --> 54:41.360
anti-American riots have
erupted across Russia.

54:41.360 --> 54:44.160
With bombings of U.S diplomats in Moscow.

54:44.920 --> 54:48.080
The Russian armed forces
have been put on high alert.

54:48.360 --> 54:51.040
Responding to a rapid escalating crisis.

54:51.040 --> 54:53.800
President Lewis has called for
an emergency White House meeting.

55:01.240 --> 55:02.920
Greetings, comrade Orlov.

55:06.160 --> 55:09.640
When I saw you in Washington
I almost was in tears.

55:16.560 --> 55:18.920
You were not supposed to get married.

55:19.560 --> 55:23.520
Not unless it cut a
great tactical advantage.

55:23.600 --> 55:25.080
I did it to seem normal.

55:25.800 --> 55:31.360
When you escaped today, I felt
not even I could have hoped for so much.

55:32.600 --> 55:35.200
You are my greatest creation.

55:37.160 --> 55:38.720
You trained me well.

56:14.200 --> 56:16.280
My husband? You have him?

56:17.200 --> 56:19.460
I had to be certain.

56:19.480 --> 56:21.560
But now you trust me.

56:21.600 --> 56:23.240
Completely.

56:31.200 --> 56:34.000
So, tell me what's next.

56:34.400 --> 56:36.640
Next, part 2.

56:37.040 --> 56:40.920
We seize control of this
country's atomic weapons.

56:41.880 --> 56:43.760
How?

59:11.280 --> 59:13.320
You won't hear from me again.

59:13.320 --> 59:14.600
My daughter.

01:01:41.060 --> 01:01:43.020
Chenkov?

01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:44.880
You remember me?

01:01:49.720 --> 01:01:51.880
Chenkov.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:54.400
Did you miss me?

01:01:54.720 --> 01:01:56.560
Shnaider?

01:01:59.320 --> 01:02:01.800
How long have you been here?

01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:05.400
I left Russia one year
after you, to Prague.

01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:13.760
I have been a NATO-liaison to the
White House for three years. Colonel Edward Tomasz.

01:02:14.520 --> 01:02:15.680
And you...

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:19.160
are my attache. Your ID.

01:02:19.320 --> 01:02:22.160
Don't worry, we have plenty of time.

01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:24.880
More importantly, our mission.

01:02:25.480 --> 01:02:29.760
The bunker, eight stories
below the White House

01:02:31.160 --> 01:02:33.160
That's where the President needs to be.

01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:39.120
How do we do it?

01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.320
Don't worry, he will be there.
That's my job,

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.560
to make sure he's there.

01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:45.200
And what's my job?

01:02:45.560 --> 01:02:48.760
Do you remember Chenkov, when we were young?

01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:51.320
and you had to finish first in everything.

01:02:51.320 --> 01:02:53.200
You had to be the best at everything.

01:02:53.200 --> 01:02:56.200
Even though you knew you would be beaten
with a cane you had to finish first.

01:02:56.760 --> 01:02:58.200
I remember...

01:02:58.680 --> 01:03:02.480
Tonight you will finish ahead of me again.

01:03:05.280 --> 01:03:08.880
Tonight you will kill America's President.

01:03:21.560 --> 01:03:23.320
ID's please.

01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:25.440
Pop the hood and open the trunk.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:34.760
Confirm this, A
Colonel Tomasz and a Major Egypt.

01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:43.000
Colonel, Major... All clear.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:57.000
You know the drill Colonel.

01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:02.800
A shrapnel. A Serbian land-mine. They spend
more time looking at it than the doctor did.

01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.680
Step though please, Sir.

01:04:11.960 --> 01:04:13.320
Turn around.

01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:18.120
Thank you.

01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:28.520
Patience is key, I've been coming here
for two years. Others have been here longer.

01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:30.880
- What others?
- I don't know.

01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:34.320
But you were the best of us.
And I was the least.

01:04:34.040 --> 01:04:38.240
There must be others here
to finish what we begin.

01:04:38.540 --> 01:04:44.240
Tomasz, nice to see you again. Pleasure.
You have exactly two minutes before the main meal.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:47.600
Ted, your Russian CIA agent, Salt...

01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.360
what can you tell us about her?

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:51.480
We think she may be a Soviet plant.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:55.080
Inserted years ago in preparation
for something the KGB

01:04:55.082 --> 01:04:56.880
called "Day X".

01:04:56.880 --> 01:05:01.280
A day that would mark the start of a
large-scale strike against the U.S and her allies.

01:05:07.880 --> 01:05:10.040
That should be the President now.

01:05:12.840 --> 01:05:16.440
You have a big job Chenkov, but you can do it.

01:05:17.080 --> 01:05:20.280
- You still haven't told me what your job is.
- Home.

01:05:21.240 --> 01:05:23.520
I'm going home.

01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:47.720
- Are you okay, sir?
- Yes.

01:05:47.980 --> 01:05:51.720
- It's a god-damn attack.
- Geronimo, it's SOP. Downward mobile.

01:06:07.960 --> 01:06:09.960
I think I saw her.

01:06:10.040 --> 01:06:11.160
Saw who?

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:14.480
Salt.

01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:17.960
I think I saw her in the corridor.

01:06:20.840 --> 01:06:22.080
The other new officer.

01:06:24.480 --> 01:06:26.000
She's here.

01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:29.800
- Check.
- Clear. Move.

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:31.520
Go.

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:34.240
We may have a visual on the
second assailant. Evelyn Salt.

01:06:34.520 --> 01:06:38.240
Evelyn Salt on the premises.
Maybe dressed as a NATO officer.

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:41.760
<i>This is not a drill.
We are under attack.</i>

01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.780
<i>This is not a drill.</i>

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:50.720
I need this hallway
cleared to the left, now!

01:06:51.640 --> 01:06:54.920
This is Jenkins. I need the
P.R bunker up and running.

01:06:55.020 --> 01:06:59.240
If this was authorized by the
Russian Government, it is an act of war

01:06:59.250 --> 01:07:02.920
and we will respond.

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:08.920
Let's go, Sir.

01:07:15.480 --> 01:07:17.680
Move, move.

01:07:19.480 --> 01:07:22.680
Close it!
Close it!

01:08:02.200 --> 01:08:04.000
Go!
Go!

01:08:05.840 --> 01:08:09.720
Geronimo approaching. Close
the door in five seconds.

01:08:12.320 --> 01:08:14.200
Clear.

01:08:22.439 --> 01:08:25.800
- Any chance she could follow?
- My own men couldn't get through that door once it's closed.

01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:26.640
Yeah, well.

01:08:26.640 --> 01:08:28.399
Unfortunately, she isn't one of your's.

01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:34.880
Okay, go.

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:36.680
Stay close. Shut the seal.

01:08:40.200 --> 01:08:42.680
Geronimo is secured.

01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:12.600
- Get me Director Medford.
- Yes, Sir.

01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:15.399
Sir, I think we need to
seriously consider the possibility,

01:09:15.420 --> 01:09:18.399
that today, right now, could
be the start of "Day X".

01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:21.760
Mr. President, director Medford is up.

01:09:22.640 --> 01:09:24.080
Mary-Anne, what is the situation?

01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.640
It should be coming up
on one of your screens.

01:09:27.439 --> 01:09:32.560
What you see there, represents temperature
drops in mobile missile units in Siberia.

01:09:32.560 --> 01:09:36.040
It means that the Russians are deploying
their missiles to the field.

01:09:36.080 --> 01:09:38.720
And that's been confirmed
on the ground, Mr President.

01:09:40.720 --> 01:09:44.040
Mr President, I strongly recommend
we go from DEFCON 4 to DEFCON 2.

01:09:44.479 --> 01:09:46.720
At least on a forward basis.

01:09:48.479 --> 01:09:49.819
Do it.

01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:55.320
And since the Russians are deploying,
we need to look at our own nuclear attack options.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:58.320
It's not on a table,
it's not a deterrent.

01:10:21.320 --> 01:10:23.120
Sir?

01:10:25.320 --> 01:10:29.120
The outer door is jammed
and non-responsive.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:32.200
We just lost the feed from
most of our security camera's.

01:10:32.200 --> 01:10:34.880
We are blind down here and
no one can enter this facility.

01:10:34.920 --> 01:10:39.320
Command, our eyes are down both ways and
we have a POC security door malfunction.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.000
Get out there, now.

01:10:41.200 --> 01:10:41.960
Seal this room.

01:10:44.560 --> 01:10:46.360
Down that corridor, secure it.

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:41.200
This is President Howard Lewis,
proceed with authentication.

01:11:41.200 --> 01:11:42.440
Yes, Mr President.

01:11:47.160 --> 01:11:49.000
Ready to commence authentication, sir.

01:11:50.160 --> 01:11:53.000
Zulu, Tango, Echo.
Seven, nine, Juliet.

01:11:53.060 --> 01:11:56.000
X-ray, Sierra, seven,
Alpha, Mike, Charlie.

01:11:56.060 --> 01:11:59.000
Whiskey, Five, Six, Tango.

01:12:00.440 --> 01:12:02.680
Authentication is confirmed.

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.160
It's all yours now, Mr President.

01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:06.920
God be with you.

01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:11.160
Attack options and targeting are
under your control, Mr President.

01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.840
- Is the camera outside this door working?
- Yes.

01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:20.440
Put it up.

01:12:20.540 --> 01:12:23.440
Officer, what is your status?

01:12:24.540 --> 01:12:26.440
Officer, come in.

01:12:30.760 --> 01:12:32.840
Who the hell is that?

01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:37.160
That's her.
That's Evelyn Salt.

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:39.800
Give me your side-arm,
I'm qualified on it.

01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:43.000
No, sir. Only Secret Service possess
fire-arms in the Presidents facility.

01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.000
Screw Protocol James.
we got an enemy agent out there.

01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:46.000
Protocol is protocol, Sir.

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:48.960
And dead, is dead.

01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:55.840
I'm the National Security Advisor.

01:12:55.960 --> 01:12:57.960
Not anymore.

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.080
Sit down.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:09.360
Who are you?

01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:12.840
My name, Mr President,
is Nicolai Tchaikovsky.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:18.920
Unless you do exactly as I say,
I will be the last person you will ever see.

01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.960
Let's have a look
at some attack options.

01:13:27.320 --> 01:13:29.200
Go to hell.

01:13:59.240 --> 01:14:00.480
Ted?

01:14:09.160 --> 01:14:10.240
Why didn't you tell me?

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.720
But you weren't with us in Russia,
I would've remembered.

01:14:31.840 --> 01:14:35.360
<i>Selected attack targets acquired.</i>

01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.020
Tehran. Mecca.

01:14:40.440 --> 01:14:42.200
Mecca... Tehran...

01:14:57.480 --> 01:14:59.360
Missiles arming.

01:15:06.920 --> 01:15:08.600
Nuclear command.

01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:23.750
You know, when we first came to Langley...

01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:25.760
I didn't think
I'll be able to do it,

01:15:29.760 --> 01:15:31.760
to resist the
temptation to say something.

01:15:31.765 --> 01:15:36.960
And you met Mike and well...

01:15:37.765 --> 01:15:39.960
things changed.

01:16:11.280 --> 01:16:13.160
<i>"The Russian president is alive"</i>

01:16:18.040 --> 01:16:21.400
What you are seeing are live pictures
of Russian President Matveyev,

01:16:21.440 --> 01:16:24.400
arriving at the airport outside of Moscow.

01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:27.320
This is astonishing.
According to his doctors...

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:30.280
President Matveyev's mistaken
death was attributed

01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:34.280
to a temporary paralysis from
a toxin derived from spider venom.

01:16:41.600 --> 01:16:43.280
At least I was right.

01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:48.560
I had a feeling we'd lost you
back there in North Korea.

01:16:49.640 --> 01:16:53.550
I could see how moved you were with
Mike's little white knight routine.

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:57.280
You were supposed to recruit
the man, not fall in love with him.

01:16:58.720 --> 01:17:01.080
That's why I told Orlov to pick him up.

01:17:03.160 --> 01:17:04.640
By the way how is Mike?

01:17:06.840 --> 01:17:08.600
Orlov is dead.

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:15.040
Oh, that's good news.

01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:17.280
Saves me the trouble.

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:22.980
I detect if you twist his arm, you get
to blow your cover to the CIA.

01:17:24.480 --> 01:17:27.960
You see? He wanted you
to come out of this thing alive.

01:17:31.320 --> 01:17:33.760
You needed somebody
to take the blame.

01:17:34.680 --> 01:17:36.320
I'm the bad guy.

01:17:39.440 --> 01:17:41.000
And I'm the hero.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.600
Congratulations, Ev'.

01:17:47.240 --> 01:17:49.640
You're about to become famous.

01:18:19.440 --> 01:18:22.640
<i>Identity confirmation requested.</i>

01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:41.080
<i>Identity confirmation requested.</i>

01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:47.960
<i>Identity confirmed.</i>

01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:47.960
Authorization, 99%.

01:20:00.720 --> 01:20:04.000
<i>Permission to launch.</i>
<i>Permission to launch.</i>

01:20:28.080 --> 01:20:29.440
Get on the floor now.

01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:31.160
I said now!

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.120
Show me your hands! Show me your hands!

01:20:42.120 --> 01:20:42.960
What is your name sir?

01:20:42.960 --> 01:20:45.360
I'm Theodore Winter, CIA.
Help the President

01:20:47.640 --> 01:20:52.800
Mr President, Mr President,
can you hear me?

01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:06.600
I want her alone in a room. If there are
other KA's out there, I want her to talk.

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.280
She's trained not to talk,
no matter what we do to her.

01:21:10.680 --> 01:21:12.960
If we're gonna find these people
must find them ourselves.

01:21:12.960 --> 01:21:14.040
Somebody already did.

01:21:14.120 --> 01:21:18.640
At least some of them, in the
East River. 12 dead, including Orlov.

01:21:18.640 --> 01:21:20.480
Who did that?

01:21:22.200 --> 01:21:24.120
I don't know. Forensics are on it.

01:21:33.400 --> 01:21:34.840
Step back sir, please.

01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.560
Please step back.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:16.840
She attacked Winter sir.
You'd better get up here.

01:22:54.480 --> 01:22:56.200
Sit down.

01:22:57.400 --> 01:23:00.400
She's yours for 15 minutes
during the flight.

01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:02.400
Then she's the FBI's.

01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:47.100
Hey?

01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:49.720
Why'd you kill him?

01:23:49.725 --> 01:23:51.240
Because somebody had to.

01:24:04.120 --> 01:24:05.160
What?

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:18.960
By this I take it, you think
everybody’s who they say they are.

01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.160
You knew something was wrong
the moment Orlov walked in.

01:24:22.320 --> 01:24:23.280
So did I.

01:24:23.720 --> 01:24:25.960
We just didn't know what it was.

01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:28.560
Winter did.

01:24:28.570 --> 01:24:30.500
Winter?

01:24:30.600 --> 01:24:35.600
You expect me to believe that Winter
was gonna launch the missiles and you saved the world?

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:39.440
I would like you to believe that, yeah.

01:24:42.040 --> 01:24:44.440
It's a big accusation.

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:46.480
Wow.

01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:49.480
He's dead now so he
can't defend himself.

01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:52.560
I guess you'll just have
to decide for yourself.

01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:02.020
How many more like you are there?

01:25:02.280 --> 01:25:04.360
Like me?

01:25:04.820 --> 01:25:06.400
None.

01:25:06.920 --> 01:25:08.200
Like him?

01:25:08.640 --> 01:25:11.600
More than you or I can handle alone.

01:25:13.800 --> 01:25:17.480
Do you really think, a trained
Soviet agent couldn’t kill

01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:21.480
the Russian President at point
blank range if she wanted to?

01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:26.840
Or you, for that matter.

01:25:27.320 --> 01:25:29.520
I could've killed you at
the funeral and I didn't.

01:25:29.640 --> 01:25:32.760
You surrendered to me because
I gave you no choice.

01:25:32.760 --> 01:25:34.080
You know better.

01:25:35.480 --> 01:25:37.960
I had a choice.

01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:40.520
You know better.

01:26:00.020 --> 01:26:03.180
If I did believe you and I'm not
saying for a second that I do,

01:26:03.360 --> 01:26:05.280
but if I did...

01:26:06.600 --> 01:26:08.920
nobody else would.

01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:12.360
Well, maybe you can think
of a way around that.

01:26:23.640 --> 01:26:25.920
They took everything from me.

01:26:27.560 --> 01:26:29.000
I'll kill them.

01:26:51.720 --> 01:26:53.160
Bullshit!

01:27:05.420 --> 01:27:09.160
We're approaching. Heading due south.

01:27:13.440 --> 01:27:16.400
Go get 'em.

01:27:35.040 --> 01:27:37.400
Salt!

01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:47.400
Circle back!
Circle back!
