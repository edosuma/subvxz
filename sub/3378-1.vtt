00:37.879 --> 00:43.438
Well, I must say.
This is not the evening I expected.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.797
Daniel, Daniel, Daniel.

00:46.312 --> 00:48.443
Life is all about the memories.

00:49.093 --> 00:51.555
You need to try to enjoy yourself a little.

00:52.771 --> 00:54.287
Take Elizabeth here.

00:55.303 --> 00:57.561
She seems to be enjoying herself.

00:58.350 --> 01:01.217
Elizabeth, my dear.
Are you enjoying yourself.

01:01.654 --> 01:02.818
That's my wife.

01:02.943 --> 01:06.560
What in God's name is this?
You were a priest once.

01:07.443 --> 01:09.381
We went to you church.

01:12.826 --> 01:14.579
First of all Daniel.

01:15.209 --> 01:17.123
She only married you because of the money.

01:18.114 --> 01:19.208
And second.

01:19.423 --> 01:21.853
God's name has no place here.

01:24.013 --> 01:25.147
You see.

01:25.272 --> 01:29.176
You never came to my church.
That was his.

01:29.809 --> 01:31.622
And I'm still a priest.

01:31.997 --> 01:33.114
I'm just.

01:33.887 --> 01:35.926
A different kind of priest.

01:37.317 --> 01:38.590
Times up.

02:23.649 --> 02:25.800
Are you ready, my dear.

02:54.039 --> 02:55.236
Ah, yes.

02:56.419 --> 02:58.444
You are ready indeed.

04:18.747 --> 04:21.003
It's okay child.

04:21.028 --> 04:23.170
You belong to me now.

04:39.110 --> 04:41.610
I'm so lost in this world.

04:43.476 --> 04:45.273
I need your loving guidance.

04:46.305 --> 04:48.524
To help me stay off the sinful path.

04:49.551 --> 04:53.508
I need your help to stay righteous.

04:54.525 --> 04:56.533
I pray,
you will heed me.

05:05.306 --> 05:07.065
And to you Gabrielle.

05:08.333 --> 05:10.184
I asked that you assist me.

05:11.258 --> 05:13.274
As I developed the strength.

05:13.591 --> 05:16.130
To carry out my life mission.

05:17.463 --> 05:21.070
Please.
Send your strength and the energy.

05:22.106 --> 05:26.740
And with your guidance.
I will strive to fulfill my purpose.

06:02.022 --> 06:04.211
Pardon me.
Sister.

06:04.332 --> 06:06.171
- Can I help you?
- Yes.

06:06.275 --> 06:07.838
Well I hope so.

06:07.863 --> 06:09.923
I'm looking for Father Thomas.

06:11.311 --> 06:13.917
He's not been with us for
quite some time.

06:14.473 --> 06:16.545
But you know where I might find him.

06:17.421 --> 06:18.843
I'm sorry.

06:20.576 --> 06:21.395
Wait.

06:21.420 --> 06:23.013
Please.

06:23.858 --> 06:26.445
I've come a very long way.

06:27.345 --> 06:31.434
My name is Serena Cuzzoni.
I'm from Parma Italy.

06:31.694 --> 06:34.475
My father,
Luciano Cuzzoni.

06:34.669 --> 06:36.838
He knew you Father Thomas.

06:36.863 --> 06:41.070
Unfortunate, Father Thomas has not
been with us for quite some time.

06:42.790 --> 06:44.517
I wished I could help you.

07:59.924 --> 08:02.013
What on earth are you doing?

08:04.318 --> 08:06.534
- I lost it.
- What?

08:08.521 --> 08:10.490
I can't find my pendent.

08:11.224 --> 08:14.099
Victoria, it has to be around here somewhere.
How could you..

08:14.312 --> 08:17.210
You're never suppose to take it off,
ever.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.113
I wonder if I dropped it.

08:19.676 --> 08:21.137
Dropped it where?

08:23.536 --> 08:25.583
I went to the beach the other day.

08:27.361 --> 08:30.400
I have to find it.
If the father finds out.

08:34.306 --> 08:36.006
Finds out what?

08:38.754 --> 08:39.924
Wait, what?

08:39.953 --> 08:41.758
What are you talking about.

08:41.972 --> 08:43.610
Sex demon.

08:43.751 --> 08:45.749
They visit you in your sleep.

08:46.209 --> 08:48.567
You mean you pray for a sex demon.

08:48.592 --> 08:52.475
I pray to a sex demon 
they called it a succubus.

08:53.709 --> 08:55.647
Okay, subject change.

08:56.792 --> 08:57.869
Well uh.

08:57.894 --> 09:00.504
Why don't you tell me something 
about that magic pendent

09:00.529 --> 09:02.402
that you found on the beach 
yesterday.

09:02.427 --> 09:04.282
I never said it was magic.
But..

09:04.307 --> 09:06.954
You know the weird thing is..
when I picked it up, it was warm.

09:06.979 --> 09:10.228
I mean I figured anything lying on the beach
in the sun is going to be warm, right?

09:10.253 --> 09:11.005
But..

09:11.021 --> 09:12.557
It was still warm this morning.

09:12.582 --> 09:15.529
And I kind of felt that something
was moving inside of it.

09:15.554 --> 09:17.708
I don't know.
It was really weird.

09:18.834 --> 09:21.006
Know what.
I got an idea.

09:21.096 --> 09:23.471
 You've been wanting to meet
my step sister, right?

09:23.894 --> 09:26.554
Well I think she knows someone
that might be able to help you.

09:26.579 --> 09:27.859
Alright,
check it out.

09:27.884 --> 09:28.990
Way back then.

09:29.015 --> 09:32.545
She used to go see this old lady for
like psychic readings and things like that.

09:32.570 --> 09:36.345
And supposedly, supposedly..
She could really read your thoughts.

09:36.583 --> 09:39.130
I mean . It's not like 
we are going for a psychic reading.

09:39.155 --> 09:40.275
You know, we're ..

09:40.300 --> 09:42.540
Just going to ask a few questions.

09:43.138 --> 09:45.333
I'm not going.

09:46.766 --> 09:48.453
Man, it smells good in here.

09:48.478 --> 09:49.742
What've you been smoking huh, sis.

09:49.767 --> 09:51.140
Look,
Nick.

09:51.165 --> 09:53.836
I already told you,
this is a really bad time.

09:53.861 --> 09:57.453
So why don't you just out with it already,
and we get this over with.

09:58.123 --> 10:00.044
Well, I was wondering..

10:00.069 --> 10:01.935
If that old lady was still around.

10:01.982 --> 10:05.036
You know the.. old lady.
You used to go see, way back then.

10:05.069 --> 10:08.357
Yeah, yeah I know. 
But she's a total fucking wack job.

10:08.382 --> 10:10.268
Why would you want to go see her.

10:10.279 --> 10:12.536
Besides, she's probably dead by now.

10:12.709 --> 10:14.076
Well, we found something.

10:14.101 --> 10:16.197
Actually uh, Kelly found it.

10:16.222 --> 10:18.317
It's a pendent like thing.

10:19.818 --> 10:23.232
Fine. You can try.
But uh..

10:23.257 --> 10:26.021
Who knows if she's even still alive
by now.

10:26.046 --> 10:27.740
Oh, she's still alive.

10:28.303 --> 10:31.397
You don't want to go messing
with that old woman.

10:32.332 --> 10:33.516
Damn it.

10:33.732 --> 10:35.217
You know her.

10:36.682 --> 10:38.343
I know of her.

10:40.028 --> 10:41.564
Ain't safe out there.

10:41.589 --> 10:45.419
A lot of gators, boy.
Eat your ass if you show her.

10:46.795 --> 10:49.271
You want to smoke some 
really good shit.

10:49.296 --> 10:51.274
- Yes I do.
- No, no, no...

10:51.299 --> 10:52.378
No, they don't.

10:52.538 --> 10:54.514
They were just getting ready to leave.

10:54.956 --> 10:56.839
Beside, it ain't that bad out there.

10:56.864 --> 10:59.289
I used to go out there all the time
when I was a kid.

10:59.751 --> 11:01.806
- Bullshit.
- Bullshit

11:01.831 --> 11:03.337
You know how many years ago that was.

11:03.362 --> 11:04.935
Fuck you,
Dread.

11:04.960 --> 11:07.224
- You're a dinosaur now.
- Fuck you.

11:07.654 --> 11:09.913
Big one. That kind
that ate the trees.

11:09.938 --> 11:12.575
What was it, the.. the..
Brontosaurus

11:12.600 --> 11:14.921
A Brontosaurus is a big word for you.

11:15.945 --> 11:19.015
But you got the attitude 
of a Raptor.

11:21.710 --> 11:23.804
Come on.
You're going.

11:27.388 --> 11:30.454
God damn Rach.
Why the hell are you such a rush.

11:31.950 --> 11:33.787
Doing that shit again, aren't you?

11:33.812 --> 11:37.032
- God damn it Nick. I told you
it's a really really bad time

11:37.057 --> 11:38.257
- Yeah. I'm sure it is.

11:38.282 --> 11:41.423
That's the guy in there, isn't it?
That's Dread.

11:41.727 --> 11:45.665
Look, you show up in my house unannounced,
and you asked me for a favor.

11:45.690 --> 11:48.994
Look I did you an favor, and now do me one.
And get the fuck out of my house.

11:49.019 --> 11:51.728
- You call me or I'll coming by.
- Okay.

11:51.962 --> 11:54.751
- I'm fucking serious.
- I heard you.

11:58.763 --> 12:00.771
This is so nice.

12:00.796 --> 12:04.527
 Do you mind if I tell you just
how beautiful you are.

12:05.376 --> 12:06.568
Thank you.

12:08.045 --> 12:11.756
Marishka has been using this..
Luscious body.

12:11.782 --> 12:15.352
As host for the great demon
Astarte for..

12:16.181 --> 12:18.329
More than 500 years now.

12:19.926 --> 12:21.457
I'm honored.

12:23.131 --> 12:26.381
That is a very interesting necklace.

12:26.406 --> 12:28.327
Elizabeth.

12:28.718 --> 12:31.171
This Harte is crescent moon.

12:32.031 --> 12:35.683
It's made up of Amethyst 
and Hematite stones.

12:36.157 --> 12:38.118
Ah.
Amethyst.

12:38.923 --> 12:40.447
The celebrity stone.

12:41.704 --> 12:44.813
Do you know that
in ancient Rome..

12:44.927 --> 12:48.575
Crushed amethyst were put in their wine.

12:49.224 --> 12:52.458
To prevent intoxication.

12:54.467 --> 12:56.795
Why the hell would anyone want to do that?

13:01.399 --> 13:03.783
It does have magical powers.

13:04.978 --> 13:06.868
It helps me with my ..

13:08.474 --> 13:10.428
Compulsive disorder.

13:23.029 --> 13:24.680
Well, send her in.

13:26.381 --> 13:27.983
What is it darling?

13:29.334 --> 13:31.018
Tatiana is here.

13:32.571 --> 13:33.891
Tatiana?

13:34.515 --> 13:35.336
Yes.

13:35.974 --> 13:38.529
The Agrat Bat Mahlat.

13:39.508 --> 13:41.727
One of Lucifer's many warriors.

14:23.209 --> 14:24.568
What are you doing?

14:29.605 --> 14:31.355
Just want the bad dreams to stop.

14:34.950 --> 14:37.137
So I thought maybe this would help.

14:37.162 --> 14:39.201
 Its more than that isn't it?

14:40.709 --> 14:43.482
Are you troubled by Victoria's little mistake?

14:44.076 --> 14:46.224
She thinks she knows where she may have
left it.

14:46.778 --> 14:49.231
But you have to promise not to get angry.

14:50.112 --> 14:51.338
I promise.

14:51.760 --> 14:53.775
She walked to the beach
the other day.

14:53.870 --> 14:57.042
She has never done it before
and she'll never do it again.

14:57.069 --> 14:59.689
She's a good girl.
She's just confuse.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.155
You have to understand how hard
this is for her.

15:03.236 --> 15:06.736
She's like your real daughter and
She needs you to understand.

15:07.825 --> 15:10.582
Only the flesh dies,
you know that.

15:11.567 --> 15:13.302
And Victoria does too.

15:16.177 --> 15:17.443
Are you scared?

15:17.605 --> 15:21.142
No, I'm not scare.
But Victoria is fragile.

15:21.589 --> 15:25.018
She hasn't been around as long as we have
and we are all that she knows.

15:27.847 --> 15:30.003
We have not aged...

15:30.926 --> 15:32.808
in over a hundred years.

15:34.759 --> 15:36.822
I know you face..

15:38.159 --> 15:39.581
better than my own.

15:42.227 --> 15:44.038
My only concern is.

15:46.132 --> 15:47.663
The bad things I've done.

15:50.533 --> 15:51.401
Ah.

15:52.656 --> 15:53.781
Tatiana.

15:53.998 --> 15:55.623
What a nice surprise.

16:00.071 --> 16:02.567
I didn't think I'll be seeing you
until the gathering.

16:02.691 --> 16:04.863
To what do we owe the
pleasure of your...

16:04.888 --> 16:06.062
early arrival.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.041
That's funny.
Even though I'm not surprise.

16:09.066 --> 16:11.737
I was about to ask Marishka
the same question.

16:11.993 --> 16:14.356
Once a whore, always a whore.
Eh, Marishka.

16:15.868 --> 16:17.343
Jealous.

16:17.627 --> 16:19.096
Not in the least.

16:19.263 --> 16:21.072
And who the hell is this?

16:22.259 --> 16:25.204
It's been a long time since
the last gathering, Tatiana.

16:25.290 --> 16:26.056
This..

16:26.682 --> 16:28.174
This is Elizabeth.

16:28.946 --> 16:29.897
Tatiana.

16:29.922 --> 16:32.910
It is such an honor to meet you.

16:33.193 --> 16:34.607
I'm sure.

16:34.728 --> 16:36.197
We need to talk.

16:37.126 --> 16:38.993
What do you know about the ...

16:39.018 --> 16:40.484
- What are you talking about?
- The girl.

16:40.509 --> 16:42.376
What's it to you,
you freak.

16:53.932 --> 16:54.972
Honey.

16:56.355 --> 16:57.472
You okay?

16:59.114 --> 16:59.812
Come on.

16:59.837 --> 17:01.727
I don't want to see
you like this.

17:04.281 --> 17:07.047
Its been half a century 
since Raine was taken.

17:08.681 --> 17:11.608
So how they knew she wore the marks.

17:11.633 --> 17:14.424
They must have been sent by..the
the church.

17:15.147 --> 17:16.535
But how?

17:16.647 --> 17:19.787
How could they know and why
had they not come for Victoria.

17:19.811 --> 17:22.393
Only the Maker can know any of this.

17:23.220 --> 17:27.298
But if we do not have both of them,
all we've done is for naught.

17:30.308 --> 17:32.265
How could I have let them take her?

17:32.297 --> 17:34.685
That wasn't you fault.
There was nothing you could do.

17:34.710 --> 17:36.074
Been like I'm being punished
ever since.

17:36.099 --> 17:37.592
How can you say that.
In what way?

17:37.623 --> 17:40.166
In my dreams!
In my dreams.

17:40.192 --> 17:41.813
Always in my dreams.

17:41.838 --> 17:45.589
It's like I'm a pastor..
or... or reverend

17:45.637 --> 17:48.635
of a church.
And I'm... I'm..

17:48.711 --> 17:52.347
reading to the congregation.
But the congregation is..

17:53.846 --> 17:54.995
What?
Tell me.

17:55.020 --> 17:57.593
They are the people that
we killed..

18:01.200 --> 18:03.005
Sometimes, you're there.

18:03.789 --> 18:05.617
You're playing the organ.

18:06.236 --> 18:07.661
You looked.

18:08.997 --> 18:11.115
So very beautiful.

18:11.439 --> 18:13.442
But then it grows dark.

18:13.939 --> 18:15.205
And I wake.

18:15.303 --> 18:17.439
To the sound of people chanting.

18:19.935 --> 18:22.877
And I'm bound
to a cross.

18:24.122 --> 18:25.789
And I look up.

18:26.346 --> 18:28.861
And overlook this mob.

18:30.116 --> 18:31.584
Yelling at me.

18:32.761 --> 18:34.180
They want to kill me.

18:39.570 --> 18:41.857
He thinks he's a savior.

19:20.678 --> 19:22.553
I had similar dreams.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.247
But I don't fear them.

19:24.801 --> 19:26.220
As for our Maker.

19:27.195 --> 19:29.867
Would come in time just like
he said he would.

19:30.184 --> 19:31.348
Have faith.

19:32.765 --> 19:35.788
You know if Victoria doesn't find the pendent
she will die.

19:35.814 --> 19:38.822
Let's not even think about such things.

19:40.243 --> 19:42.293
Do you remember when Victoria was born.

19:45.417 --> 19:46.378
I do.

19:46.916 --> 19:48.863
You were a priest that day.

19:48.888 --> 19:50.736
All for Victoria.

19:50.950 --> 19:53.158
You even read a passage from the bible.

20:14.728 --> 20:16.322
How do we find them?

20:16.797 --> 20:18.308
They don't call each other by name.

20:18.377 --> 20:20.277
They go by the mother and
the father.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.462
They're a pair of psychopathic killers
who look like recklesses.

20:23.487 --> 20:26.848
They're being controlled by a demon
whom they called as the Maker.

20:26.949 --> 20:28.816
What demon?
Who?

20:28.841 --> 20:29.915
We don't know.

20:30.431 --> 20:33.876
This mother and father have help to
bring 2 children into the world.

20:33.915 --> 20:36.310
Who both wear the mark of an
unknown power.

20:36.459 --> 20:41.662
The first born was stolen from the mother and father
by a secret society funded by the church.

20:41.694 --> 20:43.528
And the other one has grown up.

20:43.553 --> 20:45.123
Her name is Victoria.

20:45.264 --> 20:48.873
She wears a pendent, filled with the demon's blood.
That keeps her from aging.

20:49.405 --> 20:51.661
Tell me why it is we have all this information.

20:51.920 --> 20:54.186
Names, theories and all this other shit.

20:54.256 --> 20:56.326
And not one fucking thing we can use.

20:56.490 --> 20:58.810
And what of this one
who is missing.

20:58.888 --> 21:00.130
Her name was Raine.

21:00.232 --> 21:03.584
Both girls are need to give life 
to this unknown power.

21:03.609 --> 21:04.648
But, what's worse.

21:04.673 --> 21:07.788
Is it's feared to be a descendant
of the ancient Seraphim.

21:08.138 --> 21:09.458
Seraphim?

21:10.928 --> 21:11.951
Yeah.

21:13.185 --> 21:14.412
The Seraphs.

21:15.263 --> 21:17.900
Fallen angels with wings of fire.

21:18.467 --> 21:19.365
Yes.

21:19.451 --> 21:22.092
But this prophecy reads too much 
like a riddle.

21:22.124 --> 21:24.904
We don't know if its a demon
or an angel.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.934
What we do know is that
it is very powerful.

21:28.224 --> 21:32.263
And if it is indeed a Seraph.
Then it's unlike anything we've ever seen.

21:32.623 --> 21:34.959
So we go now,
to the gathering.

21:35.063 --> 21:37.368
The sooner we get this under control
the better.

21:37.435 --> 21:39.294
The others have already been informed.

21:39.960 --> 21:41.249
And if we fail.

21:41.518 --> 21:43.678
Then we'll be prepared to do
what we have to.

21:43.703 --> 21:45.245
And what's that?

21:47.344 --> 21:51.852
To open the gates and let Lord Lucifer come
face to face with the Seraphs.

21:52.213 --> 21:54.708
If that is,
indeed what it is.

21:56.477 --> 21:58.556
A sacrifice would be required.

21:59.617 --> 22:00.703
Whose?

22:01.496 --> 22:02.542
You?

22:04.960 --> 22:06.647
All 7 of us.

22:07.301 --> 22:08.331
What!

22:09.679 --> 22:12.601
The sacrifice of Lucifer's highest council.

22:16.068 --> 22:17.974
- Hello?
- Hello.

22:19.281 --> 22:20.335
Hello?

22:27.985 --> 22:29.001
Hello.

22:32.145 --> 22:33.316
You okay?

22:35.728 --> 22:36.837
Hello.

22:37.364 --> 22:38.489
You okay?

22:41.209 --> 22:42.522
Oh Jesus!

22:43.159 --> 22:44.275
Yeah.

22:45.296 --> 22:46.457
Oh yeah.

22:46.482 --> 22:48.376
You like that daddy.

22:52.578 --> 22:54.144
- Like that baby?
- Oh yeah.

22:54.169 --> 22:55.701
What you got there daddy?

22:56.642 --> 22:58.248
I got something for you babe.

22:59.453 --> 23:00.898
Something for my daddy.

23:01.167 --> 23:03.167
I got something good for you babe.

23:03.335 --> 23:05.240
You got something for me.

23:06.226 --> 23:08.440
Oh, I'm coming now
daddy's dirty babe .

23:11.628 --> 23:13.168
You're alright baby.

23:13.837 --> 23:15.427
Give it to me.

23:19.061 --> 23:20.846
- Am I good?
- Oh yeah.

23:20.929 --> 23:22.612
 I want to scream.

23:22.637 --> 23:25.168
Oh yeah baby,
I got you covered.

23:27.443 --> 23:29.365
I got you covered.
Baby.

23:39.719 --> 23:45.962
So why is this old woman with a few tricks
owe the pleasure of your visit.

23:47.454 --> 23:49.662
Well, I found this on the beach.

23:51.480 --> 23:52.572
Oh.

23:52.597 --> 23:55.331
It has a strange warm.

23:55.431 --> 23:57.501
Yeah, it's been like that
since I found it.

23:59.223 --> 24:01.739
My sister used to visit you
when I was little.

24:01.888 --> 24:04.021
Your sister you say.

24:04.046 --> 24:05.858
Yeah.
Her name is..

24:05.883 --> 24:09.397
Rachel Andrews.
I knew her well.

24:10.200 --> 24:10.906
Wow.

24:10.931 --> 24:14.890
I remember her telling me of a dream,
she used to have.

24:16.258 --> 24:21.055
She said that she traveled to the darkness
chasing this dragon.

24:21.398 --> 24:24.039
And the dream always
ended the same.

24:24.530 --> 24:29.221
The dragon chased her and
right before it got her.

24:29.807 --> 24:32.900
She would wake from this dream,
unable to see.

24:33.383 --> 24:36.344
Screaming from fear
and with..

24:37.399 --> 24:42.301
Pain of a hundred bee stings,
all over her body

24:45.400 --> 24:47.921
That's some pretty heavy stuff
right there.

24:49.561 --> 24:51.881
Sure you're not mixing Rachel up
with somebody else.

24:54.320 --> 24:56.476
Where did you say
you found this?

24:57.108 --> 24:59.561
On the beach.
Yesterday afternoon.

25:00.391 --> 25:03.623
Well you know.
I can look into this.

25:04.518 --> 25:07.275
- Maybe I should just..
- Do you believe in fate?

25:08.729 --> 25:11.386
That everyone has their own path.

25:13.213 --> 25:15.525
I guess so,
why?

25:16.000 --> 25:18.383
Your path has lead you to me.

25:19.446 --> 25:21.633
Fate brought you to this.

25:22.078 --> 25:23.734
Now you took a chance.

25:23.759 --> 25:27.801
When Nick brought you to his sister
to find out about me, hm.

25:30.033 --> 25:31.291
Now maybe.

25:31.699 --> 25:34.915
Just maybe.
I can help you.

25:54.516 --> 25:55.896
Winston.

25:56.695 --> 25:59.633
Oh Winston,
my darling.

26:00.598 --> 26:04.551
It's so good
to see you.

26:06.230 --> 26:08.249
Hello,
Marishka.

26:12.647 --> 26:14.327
Damn good to see you
old friend.

26:14.617 --> 26:15.781
Damn good.

26:16.291 --> 26:17.429
When has it been?

26:17.454 --> 26:19.862
75 years since the
last gathering.

26:20.266 --> 26:21.665
Something like that.

26:22.048 --> 26:24.378
Well ,the feeling is mutual,
I assure you.

26:24.403 --> 26:25.581
How was your trip.

26:25.824 --> 26:26.884
Long.

26:27.214 --> 26:28.581
Long but good.

26:28.728 --> 26:32.829
Elizabeth, my more treasured disciple
would be joining us at the gathering.

26:33.139 --> 26:34.444
Well good.

26:34.541 --> 26:38.147
And uh.
These are Tabitha and Rhiannon.

26:39.670 --> 26:42.005
My servants are your servants.

26:43.087 --> 26:46.470
Gifts to our beloved council for
this year's gathering.

26:48.244 --> 26:50.418
You’re far too kind,
Winston.

26:50.482 --> 26:51.932
Far too kind.

26:52.007 --> 26:54.694
May I show you to your room,
Lord Asmodeus.

27:03.803 --> 27:05.272
Tatiana.

27:05.721 --> 27:08.549
Your beauty never disappoints.

27:09.214 --> 27:12.674
You're as beautiful today as you were
when you first took over this body.

27:12.699 --> 27:15.822
What?
3..  400 years ago.

27:15.847 --> 27:17.504
Shh..
No need to go there.

27:17.529 --> 27:21.130
And please.
Call me by my real name.

27:21.620 --> 27:25.116
Agrat Bat Mahlat.

27:26.030 --> 27:29.124
Stunning bride of Lucifer.

27:29.535 --> 27:32.397
Ah..
How very lucky he is.

27:34.164 --> 27:36.594
You're as charming as ever,
Lord Azazel.

27:36.619 --> 27:39.745
It gives me great pleasure
to see you, as always.

27:39.871 --> 27:41.965
So, what do we know.

27:45.233 --> 27:48.468
So small,
this world.

27:49.131 --> 27:51.701
This hell maybe.

27:52.193 --> 27:54.787
Or some call it a purgatory of sorts.

27:56.451 --> 27:57.982
Whatever you wish to call it.

27:58.592 --> 28:01.795
So many souls.

28:02.326 --> 28:04.209
So many.

28:09.076 --> 28:10.334
Where was I?

28:10.412 --> 28:12.834
You were saying how small this world is.

28:13.357 --> 28:15.607
Ah.. yes,
the boy.

28:15.632 --> 28:16.730
What boy?

28:17.982 --> 28:21.506
We may have found a way to get
some immediate answers.

28:21.662 --> 28:22.669
How?

28:23.310 --> 28:24.693
There's a boy out there.

28:25.193 --> 28:28.928
Who called upon a demon, to come
take away his loneliness.

28:28.953 --> 28:30.450
For love and for lust.

28:30.475 --> 28:32.967
- He called on a Succubus.
- Yes.

28:33.326 --> 28:36.506
But his request were ignored you see,
until this day.

28:36.849 --> 28:41.006
When the presence of the demon that
possesses this mother and father.

28:41.279 --> 28:43.467
Were felt through him.

28:43.795 --> 28:45.920
So where is the connection?

28:47.498 --> 28:50.631
When the Succubus visits the
would be victim.

28:50.998 --> 28:54.857
A gate between her world and his
is open.

28:56.451 --> 28:59.466
How is it that the demon's presence
is felt through him.

28:59.521 --> 29:03.701
There's nothing written about possession
through anyone else but the mother and father.

29:04.646 --> 29:06.066
The pendent.

29:06.638 --> 29:10.467
The boy must have come into contact
with the pendent.

29:10.849 --> 29:12.318
What's being done?

29:12.803 --> 29:14.764
While the boy sleeps.

29:14.788 --> 29:16.763
And his mind is at rest.

29:17.271 --> 29:22.138
All his dirty little wishes
will come true.

29:25.873 --> 29:28.553
After the girls are full grown.

29:29.037 --> 29:31.998
Their blood, combine with the blood
of a demon.

29:32.326 --> 29:36.928
Would give life to a power force
within a flesh.

29:37.623 --> 29:41.474
One of the 2 girls would be chosen
to host it.

29:42.107 --> 29:44.310
If she decided to give birth.

29:44.896 --> 29:50.990
Then Lucifer.. would no longer be the one
your god now fears.

29:51.732 --> 29:54.412
But...
You are able to recognize its power.

29:54.437 --> 29:56.537
I mean..
It made you younger.

29:57.615 --> 29:58.630
So.

29:59.178 --> 30:00.912
That mean without the pendent..

30:01.271 --> 30:02.896
.. you'll die right?

30:03.849 --> 30:07.161
It's no matter.
You need to give it back to her.

30:07.186 --> 30:09.825
If you don't,
she will die.

30:11.402 --> 30:13.652
One who possesses the pendent.

30:13.808 --> 30:16.543
With the gift to recognize its power.

30:16.621 --> 30:19.965
Becomes a receiver of its knowledge
and power.

30:20.021 --> 30:23.701
And with it,
the body will age no more.

30:24.060 --> 30:27.982
But if one then parts with it,
they're certain to die.

30:29.412 --> 30:31.615
Then we may get to go out
and look for these people.

30:31.827 --> 30:33.811
I'm sorry.
This is where I call it quits.

30:34.046 --> 30:36.968
Young Kelly.
Listen to me carefully.

30:37.850 --> 30:41.741
Changing the pack of what has been written
can bring on..

30:42.107 --> 30:44.513
.. terrible consequences.

30:44.818 --> 30:47.256
This is not your war to fight.

30:48.537 --> 30:49.902
Now go.

30:50.748 --> 30:52.842
And leave it where you found it.

30:52.867 --> 30:55.536
Cos eventually they will come
and take it.

30:58.334 --> 31:01.232
I'm going to leave something behind for you.

31:01.257 --> 31:02.967
In this box.

31:02.992 --> 31:05.928
In case anything ever happens to me.

31:09.610 --> 31:11.110
No.
You will die.

31:11.712 --> 31:13.235
It is written.

31:52.632 --> 31:55.514
My journey lead me to the United States.

31:56.655 --> 31:58.678
My search for Father Thomas.

31:58.858 --> 32:01.350
So far has been a failure.

32:02.381 --> 32:05.108
Papa's notes were helpful
in guiding me.

32:05.747 --> 32:09.545
But he no longer works at the place
he spoke of in his writings.

32:09.982 --> 32:13.263
And no one seems to know
where he is now.

32:14.365 --> 32:16.474
And if he is even alive.

32:18.075 --> 32:21.123
And tonight again,
I'll rest.

32:22.810 --> 32:24.553
And before I fall asleep.

32:26.256 --> 32:27.763
I'll ask myself.

32:27.912 --> 32:30.771
Again..
and again..

32:31.717 --> 32:33.935
Who am I.

32:35.154 --> 32:37.318
And who is Father Thomas.

32:38.333 --> 32:40.224
I'm growing tired.

32:42.420 --> 32:43.849
So I'll ask God.

32:44.428 --> 32:46.154
To give me strength.

32:50.584 --> 32:53.764
Now that she no longer has the pendent.
She's going to start getting older.

32:53.788 --> 32:56.122
She was aged at the beginning,
Kelly.

32:56.147 --> 32:57.513
No, you don't get it.

32:57.654 --> 33:00.052
The aging won't stop until she's dead.

33:12.904 --> 33:16.006
You have something that belongs to me.

33:31.603 --> 33:34.509
You will remember you experience.

33:35.189 --> 33:38.009
But my face would be forgotten.

33:39.177 --> 33:41.255
You would remember me...

33:41.280 --> 33:44.216
only as sunlight...

34:02.487 --> 34:04.963
I already told you,
I wished I could help you.

34:05.349 --> 34:07.467
I'm so sorry for your grief.

34:08.146 --> 34:10.701
You looked tired.
Have you eaten?

34:10.911 --> 34:13.029
Yes.
I'm fine.

34:14.074 --> 34:15.654
No.
I'm not fine.

34:17.826 --> 34:19.458
I don't know what to do.

34:20.282 --> 34:21.130
My father..

34:21.155 --> 34:24.599
You father has lead you to a man
who has no idea who you are.

34:31.931 --> 34:33.643
It's alright,
Sister Faith.

34:35.580 --> 34:37.197
I'm father Thomas.

34:37.737 --> 34:39.041
Father Thomas.

34:39.478 --> 34:42.572
Forgive me for being so
aggressively intrusive.

34:42.598 --> 34:43.811
It's alright.

34:44.482 --> 34:47.025
It must be of some importance for you
to come so far.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.224
Sister Faith tells me
you are from Italy.

34:49.310 --> 34:51.443
Yes,
born and raised.

34:51.708 --> 34:54.357
My papa.
Told me before he died.

34:54.458 --> 34:56.545
That you'll be able to help me.

34:56.927 --> 34:58.709
And that I could trust you.

34:59.185 --> 35:03.013
You said your father's name was Luciano Cuzzoni.
Is that correct?

35:03.123 --> 35:04.818
Yes, that is correct.

35:05.412 --> 35:06.662
Such a far distance.

35:06.687 --> 35:08.786
And here I am.
I am here. But..

35:08.943 --> 35:11.381
I've never known a Luciano Cuzzoni.

35:12.138 --> 35:13.143
What!

35:13.615 --> 35:14.982
I'm truly sorry.

35:15.435 --> 35:16.690
Here.

35:18.185 --> 35:20.238
He gave this to me and..

35:21.904 --> 35:23.701
He told me to give it to you.

35:29.825 --> 35:32.133
Now this is beginning to make
a little bit of sense.

35:32.708 --> 35:34.134
What is it?

35:34.623 --> 35:37.200
I need to tell you a little story.
Please..

35:37.240 --> 35:38.521
Sit down.

35:46.826 --> 35:48.115
There is a priest.

35:48.170 --> 35:51.357
He worked with us here at the church,
for quite a few years actually.

35:52.709 --> 35:54.576
Then one day I received a complaint.

35:54.818 --> 35:58.021
About the way he looked,
upon a child...

35:58.046 --> 35:59.412
... during his service.

36:00.623 --> 36:01.935
And what I found.

36:02.834 --> 36:04.772
Was that he was much more than a..

36:04.796 --> 36:08.318
... tortured soul with 
sinful desires.

36:08.599 --> 36:12.263
It was as if there was something inside of him.
Something evil...

36:12.318 --> 36:15.052
... and very... powerful.

36:15.998 --> 36:18.450
He knew I was aware of
who he really was.

36:19.349 --> 36:21.099
Asmodeus.

36:21.124 --> 36:22.529
The king of demons.

36:22.591 --> 36:24.021
The demon of lust.

36:24.435 --> 36:25.693
A demon?

36:27.506 --> 36:29.544
What does this have to do with me?

36:29.849 --> 36:30.927
The symbol.

36:30.952 --> 36:32.927
The symbol is his mark.

36:33.920 --> 36:36.232
It's the mark of the demon,
Asmodeus.

36:37.560 --> 36:39.763
Why would papa not tell me?

36:40.099 --> 36:42.303
This is so confusing.

36:43.685 --> 36:45.912
There's got to be a reason for
all these.

36:46.013 --> 36:47.310
A purpose.

36:48.670 --> 36:50.592
Tell me Father.
What happen to him?

36:51.342 --> 36:53.818
- Where is he now?
- I don't know.

36:54.099 --> 36:55.795
And I don't care to know.

36:55.991 --> 36:57.740
He tied me up in the back and left.

36:59.998 --> 37:01.334
But on his way out.

37:02.412 --> 37:04.201
Some one was coming in.

37:05.303 --> 37:06.865
Jenna Howerton.

37:07.146 --> 37:09.529
Fine girl.
22 years old.

37:12.979 --> 37:15.966
He raped her on the altar,
at the foot of the cross.

37:19.307 --> 37:20.407
He...

37:20.854 --> 37:21.958
Ejaculated...

37:21.983 --> 37:24.481
on the holy bible, 
and left

37:25.810 --> 37:28.130
Whatever he wants from you.
It cannot be good.

37:29.310 --> 37:30.895
You're not safe here.

37:31.177 --> 37:33.263
You must take what I have 
given you and go.

37:33.288 --> 37:34.451
But my father...

37:34.476 --> 37:38.245
I do not know your father.
Or why he sent you to me.

37:38.857 --> 37:40.748
If there's something that he wants from you.

37:40.990 --> 37:44.865
It's very possible that he knows that
at some point, you come to see me.

37:45.753 --> 37:49.346
Is it at all likely that your father would
come in contact with this demon.

37:50.363 --> 37:51.824
I don't know.

37:53.621 --> 37:58.394
He always told me, there were reasons why
I had to live differently than others.

37:58.419 --> 37:59.752
Differently, 
how?

38:00.217 --> 38:03.060
I never went to school with other children.

38:03.498 --> 38:06.756
And I was never permitted with a man.

38:07.146 --> 38:09.084
To be with a man.

38:09.342 --> 38:11.670
In a sexual matter, that is.

38:11.810 --> 38:14.334
So I could never have children either.

38:15.833 --> 38:17.388
So, you're a virgin.

38:22.420 --> 38:23.553
Yes.

38:28.496 --> 38:30.254
Are we sure about this?

38:30.754 --> 38:32.144
Not positive.

38:32.207 --> 38:34.316
But we'll know more
in the morning.

38:35.550 --> 38:37.465
Tell me more about this man.

38:37.808 --> 38:39.410
He's a nobody.

38:40.060 --> 38:41.615
A drug dealer.

38:41.803 --> 38:43.537
He goes by the name.

38:44.154 --> 38:45.372
Dread.

38:46.263 --> 38:48.529
We made a uh...
deal.

38:49.013 --> 38:52.427
My protection.
In turn for a price.

38:53.178 --> 38:55.818
So, what would you have us do.

38:56.404 --> 38:59.034
I made an arrangement with this.

38:59.059 --> 39:00.537
Fuck face Dread.

39:00.974 --> 39:02.708
Big bag of dope.

39:02.734 --> 39:04.903
In turn for his..

39:04.928 --> 39:06.702
.. junkie whore girlfriend.

39:09.438 --> 39:12.157
Kills the girl.
Simple, fun.

39:12.789 --> 39:16.211
Au contraire.
I want you to kill them both.

39:16.474 --> 39:18.162
Bring the boy back to me.

39:18.428 --> 39:20.185
I need him alive.

39:22.717 --> 39:23.975
Besides, we'll...

39:23.999 --> 39:26.990
No more after the Succubus digs in
her appetit.

39:27.015 --> 39:31.983
While we are in the Succubus.
Brings no signs unexpected.

39:34.693 --> 39:36.513
Come on,
Friedrich.

39:37.170 --> 39:38.881
How long have you know me.

39:39.060 --> 39:42.709
I trust my gut far more than I do
the Succubus and her..

39:43.912 --> 39:45.935
Carnivorous vagina.

39:51.966 --> 39:55.928
I want you to become 
a part of me.

39:56.287 --> 40:00.107
Wing of light,
the children.

40:00.334 --> 40:03.771
Anyway,
in return for you loyalty.

40:04.240 --> 40:07.920
I'll do you something,
I never had.

40:08.584 --> 40:10.786
An eternal life.

40:12.013 --> 40:15.169
And the beauty of...
youth.

41:02.842 --> 41:04.082
Wow.

41:28.421 --> 41:31.694
What, Jesus.
What the hell happen?

41:31.720 --> 41:33.397
I don't know what we did,
but.

41:34.156 --> 41:35.515
I got a bad feeling.

41:35.577 --> 41:36.929
What do you mean?

41:38.015 --> 41:39.359
I don't know.

41:39.920 --> 41:42.357
I got to go to Rachel.
Somethings wrong.

41:45.209 --> 41:46.436
Beautiful day.

41:46.529 --> 41:47.747
Indeed.

41:47.849 --> 41:49.771
It's quite beautiful today.

41:50.771 --> 41:52.318
You travel far.

41:52.381 --> 41:55.443
Why not have Friedrich and Rainier do it.
Since they're already be there.

41:55.468 --> 41:56.484
Nah.

41:57.045 --> 41:58.396
She's very old.

41:59.021 --> 42:01.458
Friedrich, 
you know he's too a ...

42:01.671 --> 42:03.014
Intimidating.

42:03.170 --> 42:05.911
Besides, she knows me.
She trusts me.

42:05.936 --> 42:08.443
I won't have to huff and huff
to be let in.

42:09.146 --> 42:13.115
I spent close to 20 fucking years in
that miserable town.

42:13.560 --> 42:16.716
She came to my services every Sunday,
like a good little bitch.

42:16.850 --> 42:18.053
Besides

42:18.186 --> 42:20.413
I have some old business to attend.

42:21.123 --> 42:24.404
Perhaps you like to uh..
accompany.

42:24.912 --> 42:26.654
Perhaps we could...

42:27.552 --> 42:30.373
You know.
Lucifer is my husband.

42:32.607 --> 42:34.271
Not in the flesh, he's not.

42:34.583 --> 42:36.099
There's a difference here.

42:36.404 --> 42:37.841
But from what I've heard.

42:38.076 --> 42:39.834
It's never stop you before.

42:40.099 --> 42:42.732
Don't you ever take no
for an answer.

42:45.732 --> 42:49.170
Don't you worry, Tatiana.
Our time will come.

42:49.740 --> 42:51.646
Patience,
Tatiana.

42:52.107 --> 42:53.357
Patience.

42:54.490 --> 42:56.950
Over my dead body,
Padre.

43:01.758 --> 43:03.515
Careful what you wish for.

43:14.341 --> 43:16.536
Oh,
my fucking head..

43:22.448 --> 43:24.544
Oh, 
where this come form?

43:47.264 --> 43:49.097
Are you with the drugs?

43:50.358 --> 43:52.659
Are you Andrew Farley?

44:00.703 --> 44:04.413
Oh.
We're going to have some fun.

44:05.990 --> 44:09.912
Friedrich.
She wants to have some fun.

44:11.154 --> 44:12.685
I know.

44:13.568 --> 44:15.271
A million...

44:15.326 --> 44:16.724
ways...

44:16.749 --> 44:18.097
to make...

44:18.122 --> 44:19.129
you...

44:19.154 --> 44:21.123
scream....

44:36.007 --> 44:38.436
- Hello, Father.
- Hello.

44:39.428 --> 44:41.201
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

44:41.225 --> 44:43.482
I was wondering maybe you can help
me with something.

44:44.396 --> 44:45.654
Come on in.

44:53.373 --> 44:55.849
I see looks can be uh..

44:56.294 --> 44:57.678
... deceiving.

44:58.670 --> 45:00.146
How can I help you.

45:25.792 --> 45:27.815
Stop worrying so much.

45:30.409 --> 45:32.081
Do you think the father knows?

45:32.201 --> 45:34.553
I told you not to worry about it.

45:35.029 --> 45:36.716
Besides, you found it.

45:36.741 --> 45:40.209
When the father comes home and get settle in
then you can go talk to him.

45:43.365 --> 45:45.162
Victoria,
what's wrong?

45:47.818 --> 45:50.224
I think that girl might be
the one.

45:52.763 --> 45:55.068
You mean the ones who
wears the marks?

45:58.006 --> 45:59.505
What did you see?

46:00.724 --> 46:02.112
Victoria?

46:05.409 --> 46:07.924
So you see, the council is gathering
as we speak.

46:08.604 --> 46:12.096
From what I know that we 7 demons
put in place by Lucifer himself.

46:12.121 --> 46:14.846
His uh...
Highest council.

46:15.885 --> 46:18.526
So, we must find the mother and father
before they do.

46:19.795 --> 46:21.700
Do you understand what
I'm saying to you.

46:21.725 --> 46:23.450
This council is very powerful.

46:23.912 --> 46:25.776
And find them,
they will.

46:26.263 --> 46:28.677
The children.
They are in grave danger.

46:29.021 --> 46:31.377
Children?
My god, what children?

46:31.873 --> 46:32.982
Father.

46:36.928 --> 46:39.357
You're not the servant
of the Lord.

46:41.451 --> 46:42.990
No, it can't be.

46:43.015 --> 46:44.469
Yes.
It can.

46:44.494 --> 46:45.570
No!

46:47.396 --> 46:49.490
Remember that you recognize my presence.

46:49.920 --> 46:52.075
I was beginning to lose faith in you,
old woman.

46:53.515 --> 46:54.553
Funny.

46:54.578 --> 46:56.880
Somehow I remember you
much, much older.

47:01.842 --> 47:02.849
Rach?

47:03.310 --> 47:04.404
Rachel?

47:05.146 --> 47:08.435
Unable to see.
Screaming from fear.

47:08.638 --> 47:09.872
And with..

47:10.919 --> 47:14.232
pain of a hundred bee stings..

47:14.257 --> 47:15.780
all over her body.

47:15.805 --> 47:17.029
Oh God!

47:51.997 --> 47:53.474
Got what you wanted.

47:54.607 --> 47:55.967
Now, where's my shit.

47:58.896 --> 48:00.240
The dummkopf thought.

48:00.265 --> 48:02.935
He was going to benefit from this.

48:02.960 --> 48:05.685
This is adorable.
It is.

48:12.287 --> 48:14.365
Stupid mother fuckers!

48:14.390 --> 48:16.467
I saw that one coming
a mile away.

48:17.185 --> 48:19.279
Look at your dumb asses now!

48:27.568 --> 48:28.849
Sorry babe.

48:29.529 --> 48:31.146
Ah... shit.

48:33.232 --> 48:35.380
Best damn head I ever had.

48:36.420 --> 48:38.013
What a shame.

48:43.080 --> 48:44.236
Shit man.

48:44.261 --> 48:45.580
Hey, look.
I... I..

48:46.119 --> 48:47.812
Sorry about the knife.
Hey, hey!

49:02.147 --> 49:03.679
Where is she?

49:06.965 --> 49:08.657
Is she still a virgin?

49:09.176 --> 49:11.058
Yes.
She is.

49:12.693 --> 49:14.287
And she's gone.

49:15.006 --> 49:16.412
Far from here.

49:16.794 --> 49:18.451
And far from you.

49:20.146 --> 49:21.842
I warned her about you.

49:25.420 --> 49:26.584
I see.

49:27.955 --> 49:29.284
Does she know?

49:31.643 --> 49:32.901
Go to hell.

49:36.924 --> 49:37.955
Aww...

49:46.200 --> 49:49.013
Does she know?

49:49.958 --> 49:51.036
No!

49:51.287 --> 49:52.919
She doesn't know.

49:54.279 --> 49:56.622
I didn't want to give you
the pleasure.

49:57.974 --> 49:59.794
Or her,
the extra grief.

50:06.442 --> 50:07.473
Good.

50:07.498 --> 50:08.746
You see.

50:08.833 --> 50:11.103
That wasn't so hard.
Was it?

50:14.953 --> 50:16.366
Oh, what the hell.

50:16.922 --> 50:18.951
Since we are all here again.
Like...

50:19.414 --> 50:21.434
One big happy congregation.

50:22.271 --> 50:24.060
What you say we have a little fun?

50:26.693 --> 50:28.443
For old time sake.

50:29.669 --> 50:30.916
Don't.

50:31.286 --> 50:32.846
Williams,
stop!

50:34.045 --> 50:36.146
That name...
is dead.

50:50.685 --> 50:52.482
We're to be born again.

50:52.507 --> 50:53.622
Sister.

51:02.762 --> 51:04.067
Oh my God!

51:06.341 --> 51:07.873
Hang on.
Let me help you.

51:08.241 --> 51:09.339
Hey.

51:12.801 --> 51:14.363
Oh no.

51:24.914 --> 51:27.398
Either way,
I know it's not safe for me.

51:28.060 --> 51:32.466
And at the same time, I fear for the lives
of Father Thomas and Sister Faith.

51:34.919 --> 51:36.919
May god be with them.

52:08.842 --> 52:10.299
That priest.

52:10.498 --> 52:13.951
Was part of our church when I was
just a little girl.

52:14.967 --> 52:16.980
But when I touched him.

52:17.794 --> 52:21.348
He was much... much.. more...
than a priest.

52:24.779 --> 52:26.775
Man, 
this is all my fault.

52:27.622 --> 52:30.111
There are those who want the pendent.

52:30.834 --> 52:32.302
Demons.

52:40.146 --> 52:44.094
Once again we are gathered 
in celebration to our servitude

52:44.411 --> 52:49.177
And loyalty to our lord and
mighty emperor Lucifer.

52:49.497 --> 52:54.255
During this occasion, 
we have serious matters to discuss.

52:54.281 --> 52:55.857
Which you are all.

52:55.882 --> 52:58.163
Already well aware of.

52:59.659 --> 53:02.019
This could be the last time we gather.

53:02.472 --> 53:04.480
With these bodies as our host.

53:05.334 --> 53:07.232
Worst case scenario.

53:07.325 --> 53:09.365
We lose this world completely

53:09.390 --> 53:12.575
To this threat we now,
so desperately seek.

53:13.263 --> 53:14.956
And the Earth to us.

53:16.334 --> 53:18.701
Becomes a memory.

53:19.859 --> 53:23.935
That would leave Lucifer less than satisfied.

53:28.091 --> 53:32.169
Now before I introduce the council,
I like to say.

53:32.950 --> 53:33.950
Thank you.

53:34.015 --> 53:37.506
In case of the worst
case scenario.

53:38.568 --> 53:40.997
It's been an honor to serve you.

53:42.224 --> 53:46.505
My eyes are more than just a window
into which Lucifer sees.

53:47.872 --> 53:50.822
I, had become your brother.

53:57.077 --> 53:58.226
Now, it's.

53:58.319 --> 54:01.558
It's our tradition. I like to
introduce the council.

54:02.156 --> 54:03.219
First.

54:03.615 --> 54:04.825
Marishka.

54:05.045 --> 54:08.107
Host, to the great Astarte.

54:11.451 --> 54:13.068
Our assassins.

54:13.795 --> 54:15.979
Rainier, host to Paimon.

54:18.607 --> 54:23.221
Friedrich, host to the ever feared,
Astaroth.

54:29.039 --> 54:31.664
And our beloved,
Winston.

54:32.498 --> 54:36.525
Host to the powerful goat demon,
Azazel.

54:39.621 --> 54:41.465
Now there is one among us.

54:41.505 --> 54:46.318
Who no longer wishes to be
referred to by... the host name.

54:48.372 --> 54:49.778
And with that.

54:49.967 --> 54:51.264
I give you.

54:51.289 --> 54:55.526
Asmodeus!
King of the demons and king of lust.

55:00.324 --> 55:03.629
And his most 
prized possession.

55:05.910 --> 55:07.188
Delicious.

55:09.076 --> 55:10.474
Elizabeth.

55:17.083 --> 55:18.630
And of course.

55:19.771 --> 55:21.397
Tatiana.

55:21.422 --> 55:28.605
Host to one of Lucifer's stunning brides.
Agrat Bat Mahlat.

55:34.686 --> 55:38.842
Now, issues at hand 
are very time sensitive.

55:39.240 --> 55:42.568
So we must begin without Duncan,
who as you all know.

55:42.593 --> 55:46.797
Is host to the highly respected
Lord Belial.

55:46.920 --> 55:50.108
Who as we speak.
Is dealing with matters.

55:50.133 --> 55:53.794
Connected with the problems we
are here to resolve tonight.

55:55.181 --> 55:57.657
We've already made some progress.

55:58.759 --> 55:59.868
Tatiana.

56:00.462 --> 56:02.970
The Succubus gave us some
good information.

56:03.396 --> 56:05.107
We should put an end to this.

56:05.132 --> 56:07.232
We should go after the girl.

56:08.185 --> 56:10.450
Then find the mother and the father.

56:10.717 --> 56:12.951
The Succubus did learn a lot
from the boy.

56:13.286 --> 56:15.122
This girl maybe our answer.

56:15.232 --> 56:19.541
They're prepared to sacrifice themselves
to bring Lucifer forth.

56:20.592 --> 56:22.463
If they were to fail.

56:23.451 --> 56:27.200
As angel would arise to defend
Lucifer's reign.

56:28.459 --> 56:30.420
It also says that.
This..

56:30.592 --> 56:33.115
This angel requires a host.

56:34.193 --> 56:35.443
A female.

56:36.631 --> 56:38.116
One who is pure.

56:39.294 --> 56:40.553
A virgin?

56:43.247 --> 56:44.693
Oh my god.

56:45.653 --> 56:46.879
I knew it.

56:46.943 --> 56:49.967
There had to be a reason
why you found the pendent.

56:50.997 --> 56:52.489
Forget the girl!

56:52.982 --> 56:55.607
We need to find the mother
and the father.

56:55.632 --> 56:58.545
I agree!
Let us waste no more time!

56:59.849 --> 57:01.708
Enough of the fighting.

57:02.084 --> 57:05.669
Your voices had been heard.
We know where you stand.

57:06.342 --> 57:08.553
Now please.
Everyone.

57:09.333 --> 57:13.388
Remember, we are under the watchful eyes
of the emperor Lucifer.

57:14.042 --> 57:16.195
Let's be a bit more professional.

57:16.537 --> 57:18.576
Do what we have come here to do.

57:20.498 --> 57:21.732
Thank you.

57:22.607 --> 57:24.990
Now then, Rainier.
What do you think?

57:25.724 --> 57:27.435
Forgive me Friedrich.

57:27.755 --> 57:29.349
Many respects.

57:29.498 --> 57:30.958
But Marishka's right.

57:31.310 --> 57:34.068
We still don't know
who they are.

57:51.686 --> 57:52.998
Lord Belial.

58:02.503 --> 58:05.659
I know,
who they are.

58:12.593 --> 58:17.094
Now you need to stay here and remember
I left something for you.

58:18.037 --> 58:19.818
Open it.
Only...

58:19.943 --> 58:21.435
If I don't return.

58:21.748 --> 58:22.748
Wait.

58:22.773 --> 58:23.841
Please.

58:24.185 --> 58:25.901
I have to know.

58:26.434 --> 58:28.074
What else does it say.

58:34.419 --> 58:35.622
It's alright.

58:36.294 --> 58:39.114
I already knew that you lost
the pendent.

58:50.506 --> 58:52.005
I'm proud of you.

58:59.835 --> 59:01.459
Did you tell him what I told you?

59:02.006 --> 59:03.529
What's that baby?

59:05.678 --> 59:07.372
I know,
who she is.

59:08.903 --> 59:09.911
Who?

59:11.232 --> 59:13.568
The one who wears the marks.

59:14.872 --> 59:15.935
What?

59:18.857 --> 59:20.529
Okay.
Wait.

59:20.554 --> 59:22.326
This is a good day.

59:22.351 --> 59:24.872
This is a very good day.

59:47.310 --> 59:48.349
Time.

59:49.075 --> 59:50.191
To meet,

59:50.216 --> 59:51.716
your Maker.

59:57.385 --> 59:59.557
Erika.

01:00:00.818 --> 01:00:03.052
I heard.

01:00:03.146 --> 01:00:05.005
I came.

01:00:05.030 --> 01:00:09.966
Do you enjoy the pain my dear.

01:00:11.560 --> 01:00:13.010
I feel..

01:00:13.676 --> 01:00:15.140
my body...

01:00:15.325 --> 01:00:16.821
trembles.

01:00:17.995 --> 01:00:19.329
I feel...

01:00:21.255 --> 01:00:23.150
that I'm in a dream.

01:00:53.544 --> 01:00:56.920
Your entire existence is but a life
of servitude.

01:00:57.526 --> 01:00:59.625
Do you enjoy your life?

01:01:01.685 --> 01:01:03.771
I don't really know, my Lord.

01:01:15.935 --> 01:01:19.285
You experienced so much pain.

01:01:21.434 --> 01:01:23.587
And so many...

01:01:23.752 --> 01:01:25.256
Pleasures.

01:01:52.338 --> 01:01:57.013
You desire for lust and blood even
during our trouble times.

01:01:57.768 --> 01:02:00.651
It's just so beautiful.

01:02:03.256 --> 01:02:05.707
Don't you agree.
Asmodeus.

01:02:17.261 --> 01:02:18.593
Asmodeus.

01:02:19.058 --> 01:02:20.511
Do you not...

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:21.738
Agree.

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:26.148
Did you?

01:03:26.628 --> 01:03:28.706
The one who came to me
in my dreams.

01:03:28.731 --> 01:03:30.300
No.
Not quite.

01:03:33.868 --> 01:03:35.680
That was the Succubus.

01:03:37.427 --> 01:03:39.497
You're actually rather lucky.

01:03:39.522 --> 01:03:43.216
One usually never survives 
a visit from a Succubus.

01:03:49.790 --> 01:03:54.595
Let's just say.
I'm not as kind as the Succubus.

01:04:18.879 --> 01:04:20.301
My beautiful.

01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:22.050
Tatiana.

01:04:24.934 --> 01:04:27.343
You look so good in blood.

01:04:27.552 --> 01:04:29.982
I'm not your beautiful anything.

01:04:30.028 --> 01:04:31.411
Let me ask you.

01:04:31.436 --> 01:04:34.545
What makes you think
I ever give myself to you.

01:04:49.625 --> 01:04:51.789
Friedrich.

01:04:52.766 --> 01:04:57.013
My dear, dear
brother.

01:05:05.627 --> 01:05:06.752
Marishka!

01:05:18.279 --> 01:05:20.736
Don't have to give yourself to me.

01:05:22.205 --> 01:05:23.314
Because.

01:05:24.283 --> 01:05:26.174
I'm just going to take it.

01:05:29.925 --> 01:05:31.316
I don't understand?

01:05:32.998 --> 01:05:35.540
I know you would come.
But, why now?

01:05:35.565 --> 01:05:36.958
- Why so soon?
- Don't.

01:05:36.983 --> 01:05:40.357
Don't waste what little time
you have left.

01:05:41.607 --> 01:05:43.138
Show yourself some...

01:05:43.427 --> 01:05:45.446
amount of shit.

01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:50.059
You said that we would
remain together even in death.

01:05:50.262 --> 01:05:53.020
At least tell us who we were
before you came to us.

01:05:56.862 --> 01:05:57.993
Please.

01:06:04.055 --> 01:06:05.078
You...

01:06:06.399 --> 01:06:07.828
were a minister.

01:06:08.883 --> 01:06:10.203
And you...

01:06:10.622 --> 01:06:12.942
worked with your husband
in the church.

01:06:13.114 --> 01:06:14.130
What?

01:06:14.941 --> 01:06:17.113
David and Citizen.

01:06:18.068 --> 01:06:21.166
Citizen and David Shepherd.

01:06:22.839 --> 01:06:26.191
After the death of your precious
7 year old daughter.

01:06:26.956 --> 01:06:29.269
The both of you lost faith.

01:06:33.005 --> 01:06:34.841
That's when I found you.

01:06:35.771 --> 01:06:36.771
And.

01:06:37.443 --> 01:06:39.639
Victoria and you.

01:06:40.592 --> 01:06:43.166
Are little importance to me now.

01:06:43.810 --> 01:06:45.130
What about Raine?

01:06:45.155 --> 01:06:48.365
Yes, the other girl who wears you mark.
She was never found.

01:06:48.873 --> 01:06:50.682
Maybe she wasn't meant...

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.685
to be found.

01:06:55.254 --> 01:06:57.371
This body is only meat.

01:06:57.967 --> 01:07:01.068
I'll be waiting for you 
in the bowels of hell.

01:07:05.014 --> 01:07:06.639
That's no matter.

01:07:08.272 --> 01:07:09.483
You see.

01:07:09.834 --> 01:07:11.529
I've waited very...

01:07:12.405 --> 01:07:13.421
Very...

01:07:13.653 --> 01:07:16.732
Long time for this...
very moment.

01:07:18.825 --> 01:07:22.341
And now, I think I'll wait
before removing your head.

01:07:23.490 --> 01:07:25.404
So that you can see.

01:07:26.926 --> 01:07:30.778
As I tear apart your
insides...

01:07:31.263 --> 01:07:32.325
Stop!

01:07:34.474 --> 01:07:37.130
What craze butchery is this?

01:07:38.544 --> 01:07:42.049
You have slain an
incomparable goddess.

01:07:43.849 --> 01:07:46.732
But you have doomed yourself.

01:08:29.564 --> 01:08:30.658
No.

01:08:34.568 --> 01:08:35.685
Winston.

01:08:36.106 --> 01:08:37.238
Winston.

01:08:37.974 --> 01:08:39.791
My old friend.

01:08:40.638 --> 01:08:42.956
Tell me who is responsible
for this.

01:08:45.188 --> 01:08:50.216
A Florentine diplomat and
political philosopher.

01:08:50.969 --> 01:08:52.765
In 1527.

01:08:53.591 --> 01:08:54.831
Said..

01:08:55.466 --> 01:08:57.483
.. right before he die.

01:08:58.865 --> 01:09:01.395
"I desire to go to hell...

01:09:02.134 --> 01:09:03.759
and not to heaven.

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.236
In the former...

01:09:06.493 --> 01:09:10.564
I shall enjoy the company of popes,
kings...

01:09:11.029 --> 01:09:12.404
and princes,

01:09:13.576 --> 01:09:15.139
while in the latter...

01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:21.729
are only beggars, monks and apostles."

01:09:22.559 --> 01:09:23.817
My dear...

01:09:25.154 --> 01:09:26.294
... dear brother.

01:09:27.263 --> 01:09:31.685
The famous words of
Niccolo Machiavelli.

01:09:32.724 --> 01:09:34.575
Very good,
Duncan.

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:37.341
- You impressed me.
- Oh.

01:09:38.287 --> 01:09:39.857
Impressed.

01:09:39.881 --> 01:09:41.104
I see.

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.419
Stop, stop, stop.

01:09:43.724 --> 01:09:44.732
Okay.

01:09:45.599 --> 01:09:48.122
"So, now
all is gone -

01:09:50.911 --> 01:09:52.145
Empire!

01:09:52.942 --> 01:09:55.365
Body!
and Soul!"

01:09:57.395 --> 01:09:59.881
Henry the VIII.

01:10:01.810 --> 01:10:04.112
Last words of a monarch.

01:10:04.717 --> 01:10:06.154
Whom
people.

01:10:08.076 --> 01:10:10.458
Simply lost their heads over.

01:10:13.818 --> 01:10:15.441
You know.

01:10:15.466 --> 01:10:16.858
In this world.

01:10:17.600 --> 01:10:19.467
It's an honor
to have your..

01:10:19.882 --> 01:10:21.451
... final words remembered.

01:10:22.527 --> 01:10:23.654
I don't.

01:10:25.670 --> 01:10:26.853
I just can't...

01:10:26.878 --> 01:10:28.257
... think of it.

01:10:28.606 --> 01:10:29.692
Anything...

01:10:31.323 --> 01:10:32.542
to say.

01:10:32.995 --> 01:10:34.105
Easy now.

01:10:34.620 --> 01:10:36.269
Save your strength.

01:10:37.440 --> 01:10:39.635
Tell me who did this.

01:10:40.845 --> 01:10:42.510
Asmodeus.

01:10:57.974 --> 01:10:59.396
A great man

01:11:00.677 --> 01:11:01.994
once said.

01:11:03.238 --> 01:11:04.961
When he died.

01:11:06.183 --> 01:11:08.269
"It is an honor to have your

01:11:08.294 --> 01:11:10.402
final words remembered.

01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:13.360
Upon your death."

01:11:23.738 --> 01:11:26.629
I just can't 
think.

01:11:27.295 --> 01:11:30.138
of anything...
to say.

01:11:33.202 --> 01:11:34.640
Good journey.

01:11:36.933 --> 01:11:38.433
Old friend.

01:11:54.822 --> 01:11:56.439
Who are you?

01:12:04.559 --> 01:12:05.738
It's you.

01:12:09.763 --> 01:12:11.325
You’re the one.

01:12:13.465 --> 01:12:15.738
Your name is Raine.
Right?

01:12:22.779 --> 01:12:24.693
How did you find us?

01:12:25.857 --> 01:12:27.130
I found you.

01:12:27.155 --> 01:12:29.459
And that's what's important.

01:12:31.982 --> 01:12:33.567
But it's too late.

01:12:36.187 --> 01:12:37.507
We failed.

01:12:41.085 --> 01:12:42.226
And you.

01:12:44.826 --> 01:12:46.716
What will happen to you now?

01:12:47.591 --> 01:12:49.982
That is not yet
been written.

01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:52.927
Now.

01:12:53.350 --> 01:12:55.115
As you begin your journey.

01:12:55.691 --> 01:12:57.956
Remember, 
you did not fail.

01:12:59.179 --> 01:13:00.997
And your death here.

01:13:01.394 --> 01:13:03.944
Was not in vain.

01:13:54.894 --> 01:13:56.464
Where is he?

01:14:27.124 --> 01:14:29.369
What have you done?

01:14:30.498 --> 01:14:32.730
Same thing you always desire.

01:14:33.140 --> 01:14:35.031
But never has the balls to do.

01:14:36.651 --> 01:14:38.611
You're talking about the brethren,
of course.

01:14:40.600 --> 01:14:41.601
Oh.

01:14:41.864 --> 01:14:42.865
You.

01:14:43.057 --> 01:14:44.463
You mean the whores.

01:14:44.889 --> 01:14:45.905
Well.

01:14:47.242 --> 01:14:49.935
I was just having a little fun
waiting for your arrival.

01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.792
You,
will address me as Lord Belial.

01:14:58.307 --> 01:14:59.620
How about this?

01:15:00.004 --> 01:15:01.495
In the name of the mother.

01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:02.795
and of the father.

01:15:02.923 --> 01:15:04.890
and of the holy
Fuck you!

01:15:06.346 --> 01:15:07.440
What about.

01:15:07.465 --> 01:15:08.843
This...!

01:15:09.370 --> 01:15:11.665
(Image of Serena Cuzzoni... dead.)

01:15:16.157 --> 01:15:17.428
She was my daughter!

01:15:17.453 --> 01:15:19.062
You broke the law.

01:15:19.087 --> 01:15:21.653
We are not suppose to procreate 
with the living.

01:15:21.941 --> 01:15:23.127
Where is she?

01:15:23.152 --> 01:15:24.903
I took her virginity.

01:15:24.928 --> 01:15:29.541
And then I savories
her sweet fragile body.

01:15:29.605 --> 01:15:31.858
And then, 
I killed her!

01:15:36.486 --> 01:15:39.682
I've been on to you
for a very long time.

01:15:40.193 --> 01:15:41.677
I've been prepared for this.

01:15:41.702 --> 01:15:43.307
Old 
friend!

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:51.441
Your death will be at my hands.

01:15:51.466 --> 01:15:52.839
You traitor.

01:16:01.187 --> 01:16:03.076
You can't kill me.

01:16:03.101 --> 01:16:05.668
Ass...Modeus.

01:16:06.060 --> 01:16:08.126
You're always a weaker one.

01:16:10.828 --> 01:16:12.504
Make your move.
Belial.

01:16:46.175 --> 01:16:47.212
And..

01:16:48.155 --> 01:16:49.491
You were saying.

01:16:53.617 --> 01:16:54.689
Well.

01:16:55.093 --> 01:16:56.862
Until we meet again.

01:16:57.154 --> 01:16:58.319
Old...

01:16:58.344 --> 01:16:59.408
... friend.

01:17:23.374 --> 01:17:25.512
A sacrifice would have to be made.

01:17:27.827 --> 01:17:29.673
All 7 of us.

01:17:34.659 --> 01:17:36.044
Sacrifice.

01:17:37.635 --> 01:17:39.766
of Lucifer's highest council.

01:17:56.404 --> 01:17:59.195
I am
ready.

01:18:03.933 --> 01:18:05.985
I'll see you soon.

01:18:05.988 --> 01:18:07.543
My love.

01:18:28.157 --> 01:18:30.020
<i>(Looking for someone?)</i>

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:33.343
Fool!

01:18:34.870 --> 01:18:37.493
You think you can perform 
the ritual on yourself.

01:18:37.676 --> 01:18:39.565
Bring forth.
Lord Asmodeus!

01:18:39.659 --> 01:18:44.197
Counting me in as the 7 fiend 
right within your hierarchy.

01:18:47.585 --> 01:18:49.965
Well, you got me all figured out,
don't you.

01:18:51.679 --> 01:18:53.774
Well.
Hell a fucking lujah!

01:18:54.661 --> 01:18:56.082
Breaking news, folks.

01:18:56.991 --> 01:19:00.082
Someone in here actually has
a brain.

01:19:03.415 --> 01:19:06.498
You just don't see.
Do you?

01:19:07.166 --> 01:19:08.266
A fool!

01:19:08.793 --> 01:19:10.788
A blind fool 
you are.

01:19:11.215 --> 01:19:12.800
A fool you say.

01:19:14.305 --> 01:19:16.280
Old friend.
You watched.

01:19:16.521 --> 01:19:18.403
But obvious you don't see.

01:19:26.238 --> 01:19:29.754
Well, old friend.
You obvious don't see.

01:19:29.861 --> 01:19:31.863
I cannot give you
what you need!

01:19:32.716 --> 01:19:34.108
I have no power.

01:19:35.038 --> 01:19:36.572
I was no chosen!

01:19:36.597 --> 01:19:39.122
I am not 
the watcher.

01:19:39.655 --> 01:19:42.716
I... 
am but a servant.

01:19:44.234 --> 01:19:46.025
Nothing more.

01:20:02.937 --> 01:20:04.399
Hello,
darling.

01:20:12.978 --> 01:20:14.847
<i>Asmodeus.</i>

01:20:15.485 --> 01:20:17.061
<i>I've waited patiently.</i>

01:20:17.096 --> 01:20:19.059
<i>For this time to come.</i>

01:20:20.485 --> 01:20:21.827
Well, 
fuck me.

01:20:23.612 --> 01:20:25.268
You are the watcher.

01:20:25.799 --> 01:20:26.822
You...

01:20:26.847 --> 01:20:28.307
... have betrayed me.

01:20:28.953 --> 01:20:30.849
And the entire council.

01:20:31.865 --> 01:20:34.130
You have no power over me.
Lucifer.

01:20:35.182 --> 01:20:36.531
You never 
HAVE..!

01:20:37.895 --> 01:20:39.720
Now, 
unleash your dark reign.

01:20:40.923 --> 01:20:43.011
Or I will slit your inside.

01:20:43.946 --> 01:20:46.322
You would be remembered now as.

01:20:46.347 --> 01:20:50.089
Asmodeus.
The king of deception.

01:20:50.362 --> 01:20:51.750
Died at the feet.

01:20:51.775 --> 01:20:54.769
And by the hands of his emperor.

01:20:54.794 --> 01:20:57.479
Who, 
he failed to dethroned.

01:20:58.801 --> 01:21:00.023
Very well.

01:21:00.490 --> 01:21:01.713
And face me

01:21:01.738 --> 01:21:03.252
Emperor.

01:21:04.135 --> 01:21:07.084
We shall see who dies by 
whose hand.

01:21:07.366 --> 01:21:10.370
It shall be 
as it has been written

01:21:10.593 --> 01:21:11.631
Turn.

01:21:11.656 --> 01:21:13.740
And face your destiny.

01:21:23.974 --> 01:21:25.139
It's you.

01:21:25.630 --> 01:21:26.874
Your the one.

01:21:51.501 --> 01:21:53.269
You can't do this
to me...!

01:21:54.157 --> 01:21:55.656
Curse you 
to hell.

01:21:56.224 --> 01:21:58.741
You vile thing 
for a bitch!

01:21:59.028 --> 01:22:02.444
Aww...!

01:22:27.930 --> 01:22:29.266
My dear Kelly.

01:22:29.291 --> 01:22:31.058
You come so far.

01:22:31.432 --> 01:22:33.975
The rest of the pages here are blank.

01:22:34.465 --> 01:22:37.923
But if you inject yourself with what 
I've left for you

01:22:38.304 --> 01:22:41.067
Then you will see 
what everyone else cannot.

01:22:56.107 --> 01:22:58.934
Now that your eyes can truly see.

01:22:58.958 --> 01:23:00.147
Look again.

01:23:00.460 --> 01:23:01.994
It's all there.

01:23:02.019 --> 01:23:05.160
I, myself had read it many, 
many times.

01:23:05.728 --> 01:23:08.754
Lucifer was well aware of this prophecy.

01:23:09.152 --> 01:23:12.561
The mother and the father
put in place by him.

01:23:12.648 --> 01:23:14.778
And controlled by Lord Belial.

01:23:15.126 --> 01:23:18.443
All an illusion manipulated to perfection

01:23:19.331 --> 01:23:21.930
They were only here to
lure in his enemies.

01:23:21.955 --> 01:23:24.710
And seek out the ones
who would betray him.

01:23:25.552 --> 01:23:27.222
Don't you see,
young Kelly.

01:23:27.378 --> 01:23:31.149
He has always had control of the flesh 
that wore the marks.

01:23:31.469 --> 01:23:32.746
My flesh.

01:23:33.957 --> 01:23:35.428
I always knew.

01:23:35.453 --> 01:23:38.001
That you would come 
and bring the cameo to me.

01:23:38.183 --> 01:23:40.129
I was waiting for you.

01:23:40.278 --> 01:23:43.368
And for the time being,
I'm free.

01:23:43.445 --> 01:23:45.178
And you will take my place.

01:23:45.203 --> 01:23:47.509
As you now wear the marks.

01:23:47.990 --> 01:23:52.642
You have Victoria's blood and my blood
pumping through your veins.

01:23:53.785 --> 01:23:55.639
But, things are different now.

01:23:56.108 --> 01:23:58.196
You have your own destiny.

01:23:58.430 --> 01:24:00.639
You will now host this demon.

01:24:00.877 --> 01:24:03.867
You are the keeper of its soul 
and its provider.

01:24:04.479 --> 01:24:05.955
But, 
do not fear.

01:24:05.980 --> 01:24:07.469
Embrace yourself.

01:24:07.724 --> 01:24:09.230
As it is written.

01:24:11.391 --> 01:24:14.764
You too, 
are now one of Lucifer's disciples.

01:24:14.892 --> 01:24:16.347
As they all were.

01:24:16.372 --> 01:24:17.847
As I am.

01:24:18.393 --> 01:24:20.012
You're a mother now.

01:24:20.277 --> 01:24:23.494
You've given life to a very
powerful force.

01:24:24.133 --> 01:24:25.433
When it's time.

01:24:25.458 --> 01:24:27.272
I'll be there for you.

01:24:27.699 --> 01:24:29.488
I'm always watching.

01:24:29.921 --> 01:24:30.944
He..

01:24:31.108 --> 01:24:33.162
... is always watching.
