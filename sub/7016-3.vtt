WEBVTT

00:05.603 --> 00:09.827
I still can't believe our little Hyde
went off and married a Las Vegas stripper.

00:10.260 --> 00:12.945
Yeah. Now we have
to get him a present.

00:13.998 --> 00:17.835
What says "congratulations on your
wedding and I want to nail your wife" ?

00:18.994 --> 00:23.287
Oooooooh we should get him one
of those big electric knives !

00:23.602 --> 00:26.504
Those suckers will cut
right through your hand.

00:30.190 --> 00:31.418
Can I help you ?

00:31.452 --> 00:33.632
Leo, it's me Randy.

00:33.820 --> 00:35.628
I got hired last week ?

00:35.945 --> 00:37.929
We drove in together ?

00:38.904 --> 00:40.995
Oh yeah, Frankie !

00:41.451 --> 00:42.456
Randy !

00:42.494 --> 00:43.979
No, it's Leo.

00:46.009 --> 00:48.342
Hey Sam, this is Randy.

00:48.366 --> 00:50.068
Randy, this is
my wife Samantha.

00:50.104 --> 00:51.971
Wife ?! I didn't
know you were married

00:52.006 --> 00:55.573
Yep, they said it wouldn't last,
but we're going on six days now.

00:58.038 --> 01:00.971
Hey, we 've got to throw
you a killer bachelor party !

01:01.006 --> 01:04.177
No ! Absolutely not. If I want
to spend money on a stripper,

01:04.224 --> 01:05.809
I'll take Samantha shopping.

01:09.333 --> 01:12.621
Hey I hope you guys are comfortable
getting turned on in front of each other.

01:13.055 --> 01:14.629
- Yeah okay...
- I don't mind I guess...

01:16.742 --> 01:17.611
Great !

01:17.834 --> 01:20.857
Cause we are throwing
Hyde a bachelor party !

01:21.315 --> 01:23.381
Bachelor party ?
That is awesome !

01:23.417 --> 01:26.751
Okay, the first guy that throws
up has to pay for everything !

01:26.962 --> 01:29.192
Nooo wait, that's always me.

01:29.849 --> 01:32.937
Uhh, okay, the second
guy...ah that's me too.

01:33.677 --> 01:35.767
Awesome I'm paying !

01:36.249 --> 01:39.432
Fez you find a place, Kelso
you buy the beer and Leo,

01:39.467 --> 01:41.757
you are in charge of
the adult entertainment.

01:42.214 --> 01:44.070
Okay man. But

01:44.117 --> 01:46.962
I haven't stripped since
I was at Chippendales !

01:49.968 --> 01:51.764
You were not
at Chippendales.

01:51.905 --> 01:54.911
Oh right. I stripped
in Bloomingdale's.

01:56.803 --> 01:59.480
I used to be really
kinda out of it.

02:03.237 --> 02:07.100

Bad news Kelso, we can't have
the bachelor party at our place.

02:47.268 --> 02:50.392
Our landlord said he'll evict us
if we have anymore crazy parties.

02:50.427 --> 02:53.210
How was I supposed to know
that racoon had rabiës ?

02:57.167 --> 02:58.999
Why don't we have
the party here ?

02:59.363 --> 03:03.226
Hey, that's not a bad idea.
I just have one question.

03:03.261 --> 03:04.929
Who the hell are you ?!

03:06.220 --> 03:10.615
I'm Randy, I work at Hyde's record store.
Go to college part-time. Manage bands.

03:10.638 --> 03:12.876
If you name a city I can
tell you the time zone.

03:13.083 --> 03:13.874
Boise.

03:13.912 --> 03:15.546
- Mountain.
- Impressive.

03:16.855 --> 03:19.062
Okay Kelso, you'll be in charge
of getting rid of the Forman's.

03:19.097 --> 03:20.377
That'll be easy.

03:20.413 --> 03:22.115
Without starting a fire.

03:22.150 --> 03:25.661
Why don't you just handcuff me
and throw me in a well Donna !

03:26.724 --> 03:28.768
Uhhh Mrs. Forman

03:28.791 --> 03:33.265
is a woman, which means
that she used to be a chick.

03:35.132 --> 03:38.942
So therefore, I will just
play on her insecurities.

03:39.118 --> 03:41.560
Kelso, I really doubt
you can pull that off.

03:41.584 --> 03:43.697
Sure I can. Mr.

03:43.920 --> 03:46.489
You-Never-Gonna-Lose-Those-Love-Handles...

03:52.301 --> 03:53.807
I stand corrected...

03:54.523 --> 03:56.517
Okay now, the best thing
about a bachelor party

03:56.572 --> 03:59.077
is tricking the guy into thinking
something bad is gonna happen

03:59.114 --> 04:00.946
and then taking them
someplace great !

04:00.993 --> 04:03.513
I thought the best thing was
bringing women who normally hate you

04:03.569 --> 04:06.206
pretend to like you
because you have a dollar.

04:08.389 --> 04:10.667
What a wonderful tradition.

04:11.031 --> 04:14.518
So what we need is a crazy way to get
Hyde here without him expecting anything.

04:14.553 --> 04:16.406
Wait a minute, I'm a cop !

04:16.454 --> 04:19.178
Yeah ! Me and Fez will be
in the Elcamino with Hyde,

04:19.253 --> 04:22.630
you pull us over, arrest us and bring
us to the party in a police car !

04:22.654 --> 04:25.472
NO ! I left my gun
at the playground !

04:32.985 --> 04:35.111
Hey Donna ! Sorry I'm late.

04:35.144 --> 04:38.467
I didn't want to come over till all my
other options for tonight fell trough.

04:39.441 --> 04:41.167
Good to see you
too Jackie...

04:41.508 --> 04:45.617
I just figured since the guys are throwing a party
for Hyde, that we should have our own girls night.

04:45.664 --> 04:47.845
Well as long as it
isn't a pity party.

04:47.881 --> 04:50.264
Because I am
completely over Steven.

04:50.299 --> 04:54.303
God, I can't wait till we can sit around
and trash that skanky stripper he married.

04:55.137 --> 04:59.822
Donna, why does all the food in the kitchen
have a "property of Bob" sticker on it ?

05:00.644 --> 05:02.405
Oh, hi Jackie !

05:02.436 --> 05:05.042
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU
INVITED THE WHORE !

05:06.052 --> 05:07.860
Who are you
calling a whore ?!

05:07.896 --> 05:10.890
Well, I see only
one whore here...

05:13.021 --> 05:14.830
Girls night... yeaaayyy...

05:18.951 --> 05:21.182
- Hi there Miss Kitty !
- Hi boys !

05:21.511 --> 05:25.642
Heyyy. So, saturdaynight,
you and that

05:25.677 --> 05:27.990
husband of yours
got any big plans ?

05:28.037 --> 05:29.622
Well we sure do.

05:29.751 --> 05:34.306
First he is taking me on the Loveboat and
then he is taking me to Fantasy Island.

05:34.964 --> 05:37.089
"Ze plane, ze plane !"

05:39.144 --> 05:41.940
I love that guy,
he is so little.

05:44.570 --> 05:46.484
So you're staying
home again.

05:46.648 --> 05:49.038
Sounds to me like
your marriage is dead

05:50.247 --> 05:52.337
What  ? Our marriage is fine.

05:52.372 --> 05:53.934
Oh puhleaze !

05:55.660 --> 05:59.853
Red's got you working harder then a
hotdogsalesman at a fat guy convention.

06:01.637 --> 06:05.606
You know, when was the last time that
Red took you out for a night on the town ?

06:06.874 --> 06:07.661
Well...

06:08.518 --> 06:10.722
a couple of weeks ago
he took me to the movies

06:10.772 --> 06:14.201
and then when it was over he
came back and he picked me up.

06:15.634 --> 06:19.156
Mrs. Forman, Red needs
to take you out tonight.

06:19.192 --> 06:24.491
On a REAL date, that lasts at least,
what, three three-and-a-half hours ?

06:25.520 --> 06:27.411
You know what ?
You're right.

06:28.021 --> 06:30.089
Kitty ! What's for supper ?

06:30.159 --> 06:32.273
Well, that's up to
the chef at Frenchies.

06:32.308 --> 06:36.277
We're going out tonight and I'm getting
the most expensive thing on the menu.

06:37.498 --> 06:39.811
The six dollar steak ?!

06:41.767 --> 06:44.127
Kitty, we're
in a recession !

06:48.231 --> 06:50.896
Boy Red, that
woman is testy.

06:51.798 --> 06:53.456
Stay out of it, chubby.

06:56.542 --> 06:58.632
I'm retaining water !

07:05.189 --> 07:09.651
Fez, I'm sick of driving you around just
because your belly has got the rumblies !

07:10.814 --> 07:12.939
Hey, there is
Kelso's cop car...

07:14.221 --> 07:15.935
Let the party begin...

07:15.959 --> 07:16.722
What ?

07:16.757 --> 07:18.366
Step  on it, grandma !

07:18.833 --> 07:21.264
OW, what are you doing
man ? Get off my foot !

07:25.103 --> 07:26.583
This is unbelievable !

07:26.641 --> 07:30.680
Ah man, just what we needed,
getting pulled over by a cop...

07:30.715 --> 07:33.768
Yeah, this is gonna
ruin the whole evening...

07:36.387 --> 07:38.338
License and registration.

07:38.373 --> 07:39.993
SURPRISE HYDE !

07:40.228 --> 07:41.719
Who the hell is that ?

07:42.999 --> 07:44.784
Get out of the car sir.

07:48.941 --> 07:52.686
Errrr Fez... I know you said all
us white people look the same,

07:52.710 --> 07:54.894
but that is not Kelso...

07:56.080 --> 07:57.900
Oh I know what
is going on here !

07:57.923 --> 08:01.092
If Kelso pulls us over,
then Hyde will be suspicious.

08:01.116 --> 08:04.556
So he sent another cop to
make the joke more realistic.

08:04.908 --> 08:06.317
Oh Kelso,

08:06.693 --> 08:08.172
you beautiful genius.

08:11.474 --> 08:13.681
Nice job Fez, you
just got me a ticket.

08:13.787 --> 08:17.051
Ah starting of slow with
a ticket huh. Nice touch !

08:18.895 --> 08:20.292
I'll take that

08:21.282 --> 08:22.450
Fez what are you doing ?!

08:22.497 --> 08:23.930
Sir, give me back that
ticket before you...

08:23.964 --> 08:27.017
Before what ?! It
starts to snow ?!

08:30.904 --> 08:32.336
Okay that's it !

08:32.553 --> 08:34.948
What are you gonna do
piggie ? Throw us in jail ?

08:36.322 --> 08:38.130
He threw us in jail.

08:40.948 --> 08:42.626
Fez, I don't know
why you are smiling,

08:42.674 --> 08:46.140
but I promise you won't be when I sell
your ass for a pack of cigarettes !

08:46.644 --> 08:50.085
First of all, this ass is
worth at least a carton.

08:50.901 --> 08:52.296
And second of all;

08:52.514 --> 08:55.069
WELCOME TO YOUR
BACHELOR PARTY !

08:56.049 --> 08:59.932
A bachelor party has
beers, and topless ladies.

08:59.980 --> 09:02.258
This place has iron bars and

09:02.352 --> 09:05.754
a bum wearing no pants sitting on
my jacket... THAT IS NOT A CUSHION !

09:07.468 --> 09:10.145
Fez, I don't think this is
part of the bachelor party.

09:10.321 --> 09:12.141
They fingerprinted us !

09:12.752 --> 09:16.028
Well  I don't know. Maybe that's how
the strippers know what to charge.

09:18.206 --> 09:20.824
You know, at the end of the night, they
count the fingerprints on their boobies

09:20.881 --> 09:22.501
and they know who ows what.

09:23.901 --> 09:24.934
Dude !

09:25.063 --> 09:27.975
You are scarily optimistic !

09:28.362 --> 09:30.558
Something clearly
got messed up !

09:30.722 --> 09:33.353
Trust me, this is all
part of Kelso's plan.

09:33.587 --> 09:36.033
I guarantee you he is on
his way over here right now.

09:37.313 --> 09:39.767
The thing about
being a cop is,

09:40.812 --> 09:44.745
we may look like normal people,
I mean, I don't obviously,

09:45.638 --> 09:48.493
but we have to go
through rigorous training

09:48.528 --> 09:52.943
to be able to withstand any kind of
mental, physical, or emotional pain

09:54.904 --> 09:56.945
AHHHHHHHH BRAIN FREEZE !

09:59.692 --> 10:02.005
... MAKE IT STOP
! MAKE IT STOP !

10:05.582 --> 10:08.013
Donna, how could you
invite the stripper here ?

10:08.048 --> 10:11.923
This is supposed to be girls
night, not girls girls girls night.

10:14.799 --> 10:17.300
Samantha, you'll
have to excuse Jackie.

10:17.453 --> 10:20.752
She has a speech impediment that
makes everything sound bitchy.

10:22.736 --> 10:24.153
It's okay Donna.

10:24.188 --> 10:29.554
This isn't the first time I've had to deal
with an angry ex-girlfriend. Or wife. Or mother.

10:29.748 --> 10:32.084
One time it was
some guy's boyfriend.

10:33.500 --> 10:35.285
That was just weird.

10:36.365 --> 10:39.829
So uhm, tell me what are you gonna do
with all your stripper money ? Huh ?

10:39.864 --> 10:41.825
Buy back your self esteem ?

10:43.222 --> 10:45.726
Actually I
bought a Trans-Am.

10:46.454 --> 10:48.920
Oeh, a slut-car !

10:49.507 --> 10:51.104
Okay, stop !

10:51.585 --> 10:55.014
Jackie, you and Samantha are
gonna have to learn to get along.

10:55.248 --> 10:59.792
Mostly because I don't like being the
cream filling in your oreo of bitchyness

11:00.743 --> 11:05.531
OH ! So all of a sudden your
happiness is more important than mine ?

11:05.555 --> 11:07.856
You are SO selfish !

11:08.218 --> 11:10.196
No, it's just
that unlike you,

11:10.234 --> 11:13.290
I don't think Samantha is the worst
piece of trash that ever walked the earth.

11:13.748 --> 11:15.486
OHHHH ! YOU TRAITOR !

11:16.320 --> 11:18.243
Jackie ! Come on

11:21.625 --> 11:22.400
So,

11:24.443 --> 11:26.087
what color is
your Trans-Am ?

11:26.118 --> 11:27.022
Powder blue.

11:27.045 --> 11:29.030
That's freakin' awesome !

11:35.828 --> 11:39.224
See now, wasn't it great
to get out for a change ?

11:39.259 --> 11:42.265
We had a good meal,
nice conversation and

11:42.300 --> 11:44.672
look, we stayed
out past nine !

11:44.953 --> 11:46.867
It's like New Year's Eve !

11:47.912 --> 11:50.977
How about that dopey waiter
that flambeed his tie ?

11:51.881 --> 11:55.168
Yeah, those French bastards you
stick to what they're good at.

11:55.191 --> 11:57.598
Baking bread
and losing wars !

11:59.162 --> 12:00.630
SURPRISE !

12:01.252 --> 12:03.166
What the hell ?

12:04.411 --> 12:06.865
Happy bachelor
party Steven !

12:07.041 --> 12:07.980
Who is this ?

12:08.873 --> 12:10.369
That's my wife !

12:10.404 --> 12:12.412
Well she can watch,
but that's extra.

12:26.786 --> 12:28.923
I can't believe you guys
got me thrown in jail.

12:29.581 --> 12:31.624
It feels so fake,
like I didn't earn it.

12:34.947 --> 12:36.039
Guys,

12:36.192 --> 12:39.714
I'm starting to think this might not be
part of the whole bachelor party plan.

12:42.031 --> 12:43.627
Unless she is a stripper.

12:46.786 --> 12:49.240
You  know what ?
She might be...

12:50.543 --> 12:52.398
why don't you tell
her to shake it ?

12:54.858 --> 12:58.392
You know, it's so nice to
finally have someone on my side !

13:01.351 --> 13:05.791
Hey baby, why don't you rip off that phony
uniform and start shaking your moneymaker ?

13:07.904 --> 13:09.536
Are you talking to me ?!

13:09.607 --> 13:10.898
That's right momma !

13:11.309 --> 13:13.893
First of all, I'm
not your momma.

13:14.855 --> 13:16.991
And if you ever talk
to me like that again,

13:17.014 --> 13:22.275
I will pull your skinny ass through these bars
and find fifty new ways to use my night stick !

13:25.318 --> 13:27.467
I don't know if
she's a stripper,

13:28.066 --> 13:30.578
but she sure knows
how to turn a boy on...

13:32.480 --> 13:34.547
Kelso ! Where the
hell have you been ?

13:34.605 --> 13:36.830
There was an emergency
at the ice cream stand.

13:36.848 --> 13:39.560
They hired a new girl
and she's super cute.

13:40.955 --> 13:44.833
Yeah guys, so I'm loving spending
my bachelor party in jail.

13:44.868 --> 13:46.641
What are you guys gonna
do for my birthday ?

13:46.682 --> 13:49.042
Set me on fire,
push me off a cliff ?

13:50.873 --> 13:52.512
I'll take care of this

13:52.970 --> 13:55.518
Ahh listen sergeant, ahhh,

13:56.669 --> 13:59.499
I think there was like a big
misunderstanding. You see,

13:59.534 --> 14:02.930
I was supposed to arrest these
guys, n trumped up charges,

14:02.968 --> 14:05.304
and then take 'm to a bachelor
party in the police car

14:05.322 --> 14:07.376
and then we were gonna watch some
strippers dance and get drunk.

14:07.430 --> 14:10.530
But I was totally gonna be
back by the end of my shift.

14:12.679 --> 14:14.399
Isn't that hilarious ?

14:18.603 --> 14:20.669
That lady has no
sense of humour.

14:25.717 --> 14:29.991
I want all of you people
out of my house NOW

14:30.026 --> 14:34.136
HEY. We're not going anywhere untill we get
our money. I got an unemployed husband to feed.

14:35.150 --> 14:36.817
Leo, pay these women.

14:36.935 --> 14:38.919
I don't have any money man.

14:39.354 --> 14:44.191
All I have is a ticket
for the 1974 World's Fair.

14:45.260 --> 14:47.686
One more year,
I can't wait !

14:49.928 --> 14:52.027
Well I'm all out
of money since

14:52.051 --> 14:54.798
big spender here had
to get the salad bar.

14:55.327 --> 15:00.082
Well for heaven's sake Red. I'll just write the
girls a check and the boys can pay us back later.

15:00.106 --> 15:01.937
Fine. It's a
hundred dollars.

15:01.973 --> 15:04.579
Well clearly I am in
the wrong profession.

15:09.980 --> 15:11.422
Does Jackie do this a lot ?

15:11.457 --> 15:14.956
Just run off and lock herself in
her room when she gets mad at you ?

15:15.167 --> 15:16.905
Huh. Not always.

15:17.281 --> 15:20.110
Sometimes she just tells
people I'm four months pregnant.

15:20.932 --> 15:22.587
How  can you be
friends with her ?

15:22.622 --> 15:23.468
Well.

15:24.830 --> 15:27.538
See the thing
about Jackie...is...

15:31.084 --> 15:32.493
see it's like...

15:36.023 --> 15:36.892
uuhhmmm

15:48.711 --> 15:50.754
Okay look, here's the thing.

15:51.775 --> 15:54.312
Jackie and I have been
through a lot together.

15:54.429 --> 15:56.047
And well...

15:56.705 --> 15:58.301
she's my best friend.

15:59.687 --> 16:01.296
Did you mean that Donna ?

16:01.742 --> 16:03.526
Am I really your
best friend ?

16:03.562 --> 16:04.652
Yeah of course !

16:04.675 --> 16:07.963
HA ! Stuff that up your
g-string and smoke it.

16:11.344 --> 16:15.217
Well you might have stolen my boyfriend,
but you're not gonna steal Donna.

16:15.252 --> 16:16.967
So get out, STRIPPER.

16:17.002 --> 16:18.329
YOU get out !

16:18.352 --> 16:19.949
Well you get out times two !

16:19.984 --> 16:21.603
You get out times infinity !

16:21.661 --> 16:23.810
HA, you get out times ten.

16:24.984 --> 16:28.800
Okay, you both made
some really good points.

16:29.423 --> 16:33.423
But now I think we should sit down
and talk like intelligent adults.

16:34.728 --> 16:38.028
My Trans-Am is
gonna be orange,

16:38.615 --> 16:42.723
with wings. And
wheels made of fire.

16:43.838 --> 16:44.778
AND,

16:45.283 --> 16:48.347
when you slam on the
brakes, a parachute

16:48.392 --> 16:51.480
shoots out of the back
with my picture on it

16:51.515 --> 16:53.993
and I'm flippin' you off !

16:56.018 --> 16:56.881
Oh !

16:57.245 --> 17:00.298
Donna, this party
wa such a good idea.

17:01.037 --> 17:02.153
You know what I love ?

17:03.057 --> 17:08.534
Watching this airhead stripper wasting
away her last remaining brain cells.

17:09.673 --> 17:11.234
You know what I love ?

17:11.458 --> 17:13.184
Your old boyfriend !

17:15.838 --> 17:17.834
Wait, I just
realised something.

17:18.421 --> 17:20.323
HA, I think I hate you !

17:20.499 --> 17:22.249
That's so lucky,

17:22.824 --> 17:24.891
because I hate you too !

17:25.946 --> 17:26.863
BUT,

17:27.060 --> 17:29.807
I'm gonna put up with
you for Donna's sake.

17:31.087 --> 17:33.764
Cause she doesn't have
very many friends !

17:34.575 --> 17:36.289
That's not true Jackie.

17:36.510 --> 17:38.506
I have a ton of friends.

17:39.034 --> 17:40.138
There's...

17:45.598 --> 17:48.122
OH, there's that
one girl who...

17:49.332 --> 17:50.212
No !

18:03.587 --> 18:06.593
Listen Hyde, I'm sorry
about this mess man.

18:06.628 --> 18:10.576
But you can't get married and not
expect your buds to throw you a party.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.617
I mean, your life is
over, we gotta celebrate !

18:14.416 --> 18:15.238
Yeah.

18:15.989 --> 18:17.621
Where were you guys
gonna take me anyway ?

18:17.656 --> 18:18.971
The Forman's.

18:20.263 --> 18:21.026
Huh.

18:21.554 --> 18:22.717
Where I live.

18:23.931 --> 18:26.785
Yeah I can see why you needed an
elaborate plan to get me there.

18:29.581 --> 18:33.891
All right, since officer Kelso was responsible
for this, the rest of you are free to go

18:33.926 --> 18:36.345
It's not your fault your
friend is a complete moron.

18:38.212 --> 18:39.813
Well that's true.

18:40.106 --> 18:41.926
You can't choose
your friends.

18:43.300 --> 18:46.388
Don't worry Kelso, we're your
buddies, we're not gonna leave you.

18:46.693 --> 18:48.478
Well I hope he
gets out soon.

18:48.987 --> 18:51.593
We only have those strippers
for another half hour !

18:53.108 --> 18:54.646
I'll see you in hell !

18:59.618 --> 19:02.213
Let the fiesta
of flesh begin !

19:05.560 --> 19:06.793
NO ai NO !

19:08.178 --> 19:12.814
How dare you invite
strippers into my home ?!

19:12.861 --> 19:16.759
The whole place smells like
strawberries and baby-oil.

19:18.121 --> 19:21.785
You idiots tricked me and Kitty into
going out and having a good time.

19:21.820 --> 19:24.656
Do you know how
FURIOUS that makes me ?

19:24.950 --> 19:26.863
Sir, if I could
just explain...

19:27.028 --> 19:28.507
Who the hell are you ?!

19:30.057 --> 19:33.040
I'm Randy and I just
want to say I'm sorry.

19:33.081 --> 19:36.744
We tried to do something nice for our
friend and things got really out of hand but

19:36.768 --> 19:40.302
I apologise for any disrespect
that we may have shown you

19:41.558 --> 19:42.768
Well Randy,

19:43.449 --> 19:45.071
I'm impressed. That

19:45.118 --> 19:49.099
something so articulate could
come out of such a dumb-ass !

19:50.290 --> 19:51.429
And YOU,

19:51.511 --> 19:53.648
you owe me a
hundred dollars !

19:53.989 --> 19:54.787
Fine.

19:56.525 --> 19:59.085
But you better put
on one hell of a show.

20:04.884 --> 20:07.808
Why is it all in
one-dollar bills ?

20:08.548 --> 20:10.508
Cause that's how
you pay strippers.

20:13.674 --> 20:16.210
I was in the war
for God's sake !

20:18.782 --> 20:20.472
You guys are not
gonna believe this.

20:20.977 --> 20:23.020
I was fired !
I'm off the force.

20:23.068 --> 20:26.614
Man, if only I have said I
didn't want a bachelor party

20:26.638 --> 20:28.728
maybe none of this
would have happened !

20:30.207 --> 20:31.158
Oh well.

20:32.565 --> 20:36.240
It was humiliating. They took
my badge and they took my gun

20:36.263 --> 20:40.244
and then when I went to say goodbye to
the police dog, I accidentally shot him.

20:46.789 --> 20:49.266
There is only one thing that
would cheer me up tonight.

20:49.419 --> 20:50.673
A strip club ?!

20:50.697 --> 20:53.151
You freaky little
mindreader !

20:54.301 --> 20:56.567
Let's go, I'll drive.
We'll take my cop car.

20:57.248 --> 20:58.916
Wait, you didn't
have to turn that in ?

20:58.952 --> 21:01.053
They didn't even ask !

21:07.276 --> 21:10.998
All right guys, sit
back and enjoy the show

21:22.156 --> 21:24.281
Err Leo, when does
the show start ?

21:24.798 --> 21:26.581
This IS the show man.

21:27.896 --> 21:29.329
Where's the stripper ?

21:29.857 --> 21:31.888
What do we need
a stripper for ?

21:31.971 --> 21:33.943
We got a giant cake !
