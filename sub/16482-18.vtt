WEBVTT

00:00.172 --> 00:01.757
Previously on This is Us...

00:01.781 --> 00:03.882
The band booked a 5-state tour...

00:05.898 --> 00:07.000
and I think I wanna go.

00:07.680 --> 00:10.580
When we were together she
never wanted to get married.

00:10.586 --> 00:11.902
What do you mean, together?

00:12.129 --> 00:13.650
We dated for two months... two months,

00:13.656 --> 00:16.053
- when I was 19 years old.
- You've been spending

00:16.059 --> 00:18.248
three nights a week at rehearsal

00:18.254 --> 00:19.823
- till 11:00 at night with this guy
- Shh...

00:19.828 --> 00:21.291
and you think that I
didn't deserve to know

00:21.296 --> 00:22.797
that you had a history with him?

00:22.865 --> 00:24.432
Why didn't you go to her show tonight?

00:24.500 --> 00:26.559
First of all, it is two hours away...

00:26.565 --> 00:28.668
Yeah... it's two hours away.

01:21.113 --> 01:22.590
What the hell are you doing, Jack?

01:23.277 --> 01:24.659
What are you doing, Jack?

01:25.395 --> 01:26.160
Jack?

01:26.228 --> 01:27.691
Yeah, I'm just making sure everything's

01:27.696 --> 01:29.223
in tip-top shape, Mrs. Peabody.

01:31.465 --> 01:33.527
So, the filter...

01:33.809 --> 01:36.637
it just wasn't on right...
thank you... so I reset that.

01:36.645 --> 01:38.919
Shouldn't have any more oil leaks.
You'll-you'll be good to go.

01:38.924 --> 01:40.824
- Oh, thank you, Jack.
- You're welcome.

01:40.830 --> 01:43.309
I don't know why my husband
loved that thing so much.

01:43.315 --> 01:45.044
Something's always wrong with it.

01:45.049 --> 01:46.483
Maybe I should just sell it.

01:46.955 --> 01:48.793
Oh... You watch your
mouth, Mrs. Peabody.

01:48.799 --> 01:50.090
This is a Super Sport.

01:50.096 --> 01:53.598
You cannot sell a
1967 Chevelle Super Sport.

01:53.630 --> 01:55.942
All right. All right, I'll keep it.

01:57.363 --> 01:59.160
Here you are.

02:01.410 --> 02:02.410
Oh.

02:04.262 --> 02:07.707
I'm sorry I can't offer you more,
but since Hank passed

02:07.848 --> 02:09.925
- I have to be so careful...
- Come on now, it's...

02:10.356 --> 02:11.387
I appreciate it.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.668
But if... you know, if you have friends

02:13.674 --> 02:15.692
that need any work done or anything,

02:15.698 --> 02:18.418
just send 'em my way.
I-I can do carpentry,

02:18.424 --> 02:20.291
dry walling, electric, you name it.

02:20.297 --> 02:22.934
I'll send anyone and
everyone I know your way.

02:23.021 --> 02:25.395
Thank you.
I appreciate it, Mrs. Peabody.

02:26.614 --> 02:29.183
How did you come back
from Vietnam so nice?

02:29.250 --> 02:31.982
Seems like most of the boys
lose their damn minds over there.

02:31.988 --> 02:33.410
Yeah, well...

02:34.012 --> 02:35.856
I was just a mechanic.
You know, maybe...

02:35.924 --> 02:37.958
maybe we had it a
little easier over there.

02:40.285 --> 02:42.035
Wish I had a granddaughter for you.

02:42.113 --> 02:42.910
Oh...

02:43.078 --> 02:44.512
Wait a second, now.

02:44.648 --> 02:46.883
I know a girl I think you might like.

02:46.928 --> 02:48.528
My best friend's granddaughter.

02:48.628 --> 02:50.676
Oh, Jack, she's the sweetest thing.

02:50.973 --> 02:53.942
Uh, I'm not... I'm not really
one to be set up, Mrs. Peabody.

02:53.948 --> 02:55.254
What are you doing Friday night?

02:56.387 --> 02:57.699
You'll take her out?

02:57.839 --> 02:59.706
Oh, it would make me so happy.

03:02.434 --> 03:03.293
All right.

03:03.299 --> 03:04.958
I'll call you to confirm.

03:05.106 --> 03:06.098
You'll thank me.

03:06.104 --> 03:07.861
She's a total knockout.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.825
Kathryn, how's the
wedding planning going?

03:11.831 --> 03:12.481
Mm. Slowly.

03:12.487 --> 03:15.084
I want to serve Lobster
Newberg, but Edward is obsessed

03:15.090 --> 03:16.770
with Beef Wellington.

03:16.837 --> 03:19.074
I think because his parents
served it at their wedding.

03:19.277 --> 03:21.662
Oh, come on. That's kind of cute.

03:21.668 --> 03:22.442
No, it is.

03:22.510 --> 03:24.410
He's cute.

03:28.700 --> 03:30.768
Um, have you decided if
you're bringing anyone

03:30.836 --> 03:32.103
- to the wedding?
- Mm!

03:32.171 --> 03:33.534
- Oh...
- My planner keeps asking me.

03:33.539 --> 03:35.238
I'm so sorry. Yeah, probably not.

03:35.244 --> 03:37.675
But it's okay... you can
just put me at the table

03:37.743 --> 03:39.943
with the spinster aunts
and the reject cousins.

03:43.528 --> 03:45.668
- Please do not set me up.
- Let me set you up.

03:45.731 --> 03:48.318
I'm sorry, it's just that
everybody wants to set me up

03:48.324 --> 03:50.387
for some reason... my
mother and my grandmother

03:50.393 --> 03:53.215
and my grandmother's
friends, and I'm fine.

03:53.262 --> 03:55.968
There's nothing wrong with me
focusing on my career, you know?

03:55.974 --> 03:57.942
- You mean the singing?
- Yeah.

03:58.457 --> 03:59.810
I mean the singing.

04:00.629 --> 04:02.700
You do know that things are
actually going pretty well

04:02.705 --> 04:05.324
for me right now, right?
I sing at open mics

04:05.330 --> 04:06.723
every Friday and Saturday night

04:06.729 --> 04:07.821
at different bars around town.

04:07.826 --> 04:08.194
- Oh.
- Yeah.

04:08.231 --> 04:11.059
And I just recorded a demo.

04:11.332 --> 04:12.449
- Wow.
- Yeah.

04:12.668 --> 04:14.457
My cousin who works for Elektra Records

04:14.463 --> 04:16.434
promised that he would
have them listen to it.

04:17.060 --> 04:19.863
So, things are going well for me.

04:20.365 --> 04:22.200
- You know?
- Yeah.

04:24.559 --> 04:25.559
What?

04:26.035 --> 04:28.934
Rebecca, we are so happy
things are going so well for you.

04:28.940 --> 04:30.474
- Thank you.
- We are. I mean,

04:30.488 --> 04:32.370
you're the only one of us doing anything

04:32.430 --> 04:34.145
even remotely exciting.

04:34.207 --> 04:37.777
But... becoming a successful singer?

04:37.783 --> 04:38.783
Mm-hmm.

04:38.895 --> 04:40.965
The odds are like one in a million.

04:41.130 --> 04:43.934
It's like what Edward says about stocks.

04:44.411 --> 04:46.535
- He's in finance.
- Yeah, we know, Kathryn.

04:46.541 --> 04:47.402
It's just...

04:47.408 --> 04:50.152
- it's too risky to just buy one thing.
- Yeah.

04:50.236 --> 04:52.363
You also have to diversify.

04:53.621 --> 04:56.657
- You have a beautiful voice, Bec.
- Oh.

04:56.934 --> 04:59.582
And maybe you're gonna
be the next Carole King.

04:59.934 --> 05:01.090
But what if you're not?

05:01.613 --> 05:04.471
Don't you think that
you should diversify,

05:04.539 --> 05:05.539
just in case?

05:23.067 --> 05:24.543
Excuse me. Hey.

05:24.779 --> 05:26.887
Get a Bud, please and a bourbon back.

05:42.625 --> 05:43.904
Come in.

05:45.701 --> 05:47.568
Wow, you look great.

05:47.574 --> 05:49.193
I look like a mom playing dress-up.

05:49.748 --> 05:51.646
Not like any Mom I know.

05:51.826 --> 05:53.487
Ben, there are a lot
of people out there.

05:53.493 --> 05:55.669
- I know.
- No, like, a lot of people.

05:55.675 --> 05:58.208
Like, more people than I've
sung in front of in 15 years.

05:58.216 --> 05:59.216
Yes.

05:59.427 --> 06:01.216
I should be watching E.R.

06:01.396 --> 06:02.169
Sorry?

06:02.175 --> 06:03.931
I... Three months ago,

06:03.998 --> 06:05.899
if I was up past 9:00
on a Thursday night,

06:05.967 --> 06:07.734
it's 'cause I was watching
E.R., and now

06:07.802 --> 06:10.237
I'm about to go out and
perform in front of more people

06:10.305 --> 06:12.662
than I have in 15
years, and I have kids.

06:12.865 --> 06:15.419
I have multiple kids, Ben.
I have no business

06:15.425 --> 06:17.065
- being on stage and...
- Stop, stop. Shh.

06:17.076 --> 06:18.646
Take a breath.

06:19.630 --> 06:20.630
Listen to me.

06:21.779 --> 06:24.130
E.R. is a repeat tonight.

06:28.794 --> 06:30.154
You okay?

06:30.204 --> 06:31.560
Oh, I think so.

06:31.566 --> 06:33.310
I think I am, yeah.

06:36.854 --> 06:38.513
- Whoa.
- Sorry.

06:39.763 --> 06:41.380
What the hell was that?

06:41.386 --> 06:43.437
- Wh-What the hell are you doing?
- Sorry.

06:43.443 --> 06:45.099
Sorry, sorry, I thought...

06:45.105 --> 06:47.498
- What the hell were you thinking, Ben?
- I...

06:48.948 --> 06:51.021
Is this why you asked me
to join the band?

06:51.271 --> 06:52.546
- No.
- 'Cause you...

06:52.614 --> 06:54.060
No, of course not.

06:56.147 --> 06:57.279
He was right.

06:58.373 --> 06:59.873
Of course he was right.

07:00.302 --> 07:02.163
- Wow.
- Rebecca, let's just forget it.

07:02.169 --> 07:03.689
God, Ben, why did you have to do that?

07:12.833 --> 07:14.802
Yo, can I get one more of these?

07:15.224 --> 07:16.785
- Yeah, no problem.
- Thanks.

07:29.335 --> 07:30.740
- Hey, sweetheart.
- Mm.

07:30.764 --> 07:32.021
Find a job yet?

07:32.912 --> 07:35.702
You know, uh... had two jobs today.

07:35.769 --> 07:38.042
- Fixed Mrs. Peabody's car and I...
- Yeah, I mean-I mean

07:38.105 --> 07:40.224
a real job, with a salary.

07:42.091 --> 07:43.239
You know what, I'm-I'm making money

07:43.244 --> 07:44.964
and I'm paying you rent.

07:45.279 --> 07:47.521
Can't buy a pack of
smokes with your rent.

07:48.177 --> 07:50.757
Let's all... raise a glass

07:50.763 --> 07:53.396
to my unemployed 28-year-old son...

07:53.412 --> 07:55.175
...who's probably gonna live in my attic

07:55.180 --> 07:56.349
till the end of time.

07:56.355 --> 07:58.616
Yeah, you know what,
drink up. 'Cause God forbid

07:58.622 --> 08:01.326
you go a night without
finishing the entire bottle, huh?

08:04.796 --> 08:06.005
What'd you say to me?

08:11.029 --> 08:12.029
Nothing.

08:12.528 --> 08:13.701
That's my boy.

08:29.781 --> 08:34.413
Now here's Clemente...
341 last year, 86 RBIs,

08:34.419 --> 08:37.294
and then in the World
Series he hit .414...

09:21.793 --> 09:23.795
Hey, you've reached
Jack, Rebecca, Kevin,

09:23.800 --> 09:26.419

- Wait, wait, wait, wait, Jack.
- Don't touch me.

12:22.665 --> 12:24.028
- Jack, buddy, buddy...
- Don't touch me.

12:24.033 --> 12:25.296
- Okay, you're drunk.
- Don't touch me.

12:25.301 --> 12:26.401
All right? All right?

12:26.469 --> 12:28.098
This is... this is a big night for us.

12:30.184 --> 12:31.262
Oh, "for us"?

12:31.785 --> 12:33.037
Oh, come on, man, don't do this.

12:33.042 --> 12:34.817
Look, I don't know what she told you,

12:34.823 --> 12:36.398
but don't punish her because
I crossed the line.

12:36.403 --> 12:37.403
Hey, Bec?

12:39.225 --> 12:40.270
What'd you say?

12:41.106 --> 12:42.106
Jack...

12:48.784 --> 12:50.129
Come on.

12:51.762 --> 12:52.889
Jack?

12:52.895 --> 12:54.012
Come on.

12:54.215 --> 12:55.528
Jack!

12:58.590 --> 13:01.262
Okay... yeah, okay. Okay.

13:01.387 --> 13:02.574
Okay.

13:02.828 --> 13:03.887
It's okay.

13:08.289 --> 13:09.289
No.

13:10.098 --> 13:11.234
What do you want to do here?

13:11.239 --> 13:12.317
Want us to call the cops?

13:13.199 --> 13:14.199
No.

13:15.371 --> 13:16.654
All right, come on, pal, you're done.

13:16.659 --> 13:18.528
- I'll be right out there.
- No, you...

13:18.807 --> 13:21.001
- stay, you stay.
- I will be right there. Don't let him

13:21.006 --> 13:22.486
- get in the car by himself.
- Got it.

13:23.496 --> 13:25.426
I have to go drive him home, Ben.

13:26.332 --> 13:28.043
Bec, we go on in 20 minutes.

13:30.816 --> 13:31.989
It's over, Ben.

13:32.152 --> 13:33.152
It's...

13:33.965 --> 13:35.340
it's all over.

14:09.067 --> 14:12.871
_

14:29.587 --> 14:31.050
Hi, Janet?

14:31.467 --> 14:34.050
- Hi. It's Rebecca.
- How are you?

14:34.590 --> 14:37.215
Do you remember when you
said you had a nice guy

14:37.221 --> 14:38.381
you wanted to set me up with?

14:38.636 --> 14:40.293
No, I-I remember what I said.

14:40.323 --> 14:42.980
But, um, I've been thinking lately,

14:42.986 --> 14:44.222
maybe...

14:44.947 --> 14:46.183
it's time...

14:47.105 --> 14:48.347
I diversify.

15:07.199 --> 15:08.199
Hello?

15:08.902 --> 15:10.511
Oh, hi, Mrs. Peabody.

15:10.517 --> 15:12.418
Yeah, look, actually,
I was just on my way...

15:13.699 --> 15:14.777
Right.

15:15.386 --> 15:17.175
Yeah, right, the date. Okay.

15:17.599 --> 15:18.629
Um...

15:20.785 --> 15:21.785
Yeah.

15:22.780 --> 15:24.457
Friday... Friday is fine.

15:26.865 --> 15:28.519
Okay, I'll-I'll meet her there.

15:29.604 --> 15:30.621
Okay.

15:31.410 --> 15:32.715
Sounds good.

15:33.605 --> 15:34.605
Okay.

15:34.745 --> 15:35.745
Thank you.

15:36.115 --> 15:38.957
Thank you, thank you,
Mrs. Peabody. Okay... bye.

15:41.832 --> 15:43.099
I don't like this, Jack.

15:43.582 --> 15:45.216
You know, maybe we should turn back.

15:45.284 --> 15:47.418
We could go... we could go grab a slice,

15:47.486 --> 15:49.220
go back to my place, watch Gunsmoke...

15:49.288 --> 15:51.035
Hey, would you cut...
would you cut it out?

15:51.761 --> 15:52.832
Come on.

15:53.191 --> 15:55.260
Hey, have some faith, D, all right?

15:55.816 --> 15:57.332
We deserve to catch a break.

16:03.528 --> 16:04.528
Yeah?

16:04.970 --> 16:07.652
Um... Jack and Darryl, friends of Alex.

16:16.081 --> 16:17.230
Hey, Alex.

16:19.726 --> 16:21.035
You boys want a drink?

16:21.041 --> 16:23.691
- Oh, um, I'll have a beer.
- Two club sodas.

16:34.705 --> 16:35.705
Hey.

16:36.870 --> 16:38.333
Welcome, gentlemen.

16:38.339 --> 16:40.060
Game's five-card draw.

16:40.066 --> 16:42.294
Ten dollar ante. No limits.

16:42.300 --> 16:43.622
Nice, clean game.

16:43.808 --> 16:44.874
Understood?

16:45.192 --> 16:46.459
Understood. Yes, sir.

16:46.613 --> 16:47.716
You playing, Ray?

16:49.181 --> 16:50.365
Sure, why not?

16:55.847 --> 16:56.847
Ante up.

17:17.708 --> 17:19.161
- I'm in.
- Ten.

17:20.580 --> 17:23.340
Ten... and ten more.

17:25.249 --> 17:26.249
All right.

17:26.940 --> 17:27.940
I'm in.

17:30.708 --> 17:33.802
I'm in. And I'll raise you $40.

17:37.262 --> 17:38.279
I fold.

17:42.205 --> 17:43.622
Raise you another $40.

17:44.823 --> 17:45.823
I'm out.

17:46.142 --> 17:47.216
Okay,

17:47.571 --> 17:48.571
I'll play.

17:50.915 --> 17:51.915
I'm out.

17:56.794 --> 17:57.794
Call.

17:58.981 --> 18:00.177
I'll take one.

18:06.157 --> 18:07.157
Give me two.

18:10.141 --> 18:11.216
I'll take two.

18:23.908 --> 18:24.934
Check.

18:33.721 --> 18:35.021
Seventy-five.

18:37.008 --> 18:38.482
Okay, handsome,

18:39.021 --> 18:40.240
I'll see you.

18:42.335 --> 18:43.654
And I'll raise you.

18:43.968 --> 18:45.240
How much you got left?

18:47.802 --> 18:49.568
- Jack...
- Shut up!

18:54.730 --> 18:55.896
$360.

18:56.531 --> 18:57.575
Okay.

19:00.159 --> 19:01.169
$360.

19:03.720 --> 19:04.786
I fold.

19:11.985 --> 19:13.450
All right, let's see 'em.

19:17.247 --> 19:18.497
Full house.

19:24.083 --> 19:25.161
Queens.

19:28.497 --> 19:30.052
New guy wins the pot.

19:39.217 --> 19:41.021
Just a lucky hand, fellas.

19:41.186 --> 19:42.193
Yeah.

19:48.083 --> 19:50.460
You know, I think...
I think maybe this game

19:50.528 --> 19:52.497
might be a little too rich for my blood,

19:52.503 --> 19:53.662
so I'm gonna call it a night.

19:53.667 --> 19:55.013
No, whoa. Excuse me.

19:55.513 --> 19:57.677
You played one hand and you're done?

19:58.396 --> 20:00.375
- Like I said...
- I heard what you said.

20:00.880 --> 20:02.716
Huh? You didn't even finish your drink.

20:19.931 --> 20:21.247
That's for the drink.

20:27.975 --> 20:28.927
Holy crap.

20:28.933 --> 20:31.279
- Holy crap. Holy crap.
- Hey, will y... Shh!

20:31.626 --> 20:34.341
You must've just won 1,500 bucks.

20:35.137 --> 20:36.888
Holy crap.

20:36.894 --> 20:38.762
Holy crap. Holy crap.

20:39.054 --> 20:41.630
Oh, I knew it. I knew it. You see? I...

20:41.636 --> 20:43.615
See, this is what I've
been telling you, D.

20:43.966 --> 20:46.349
The good guys, they
don't always finish last.

20:52.633 --> 20:53.747
Hey!

20:59.130 --> 21:02.099
Ray sees either one
of you again... he'll kill you.

21:10.615 --> 21:12.161
Come on, Jack.

21:14.976 --> 21:16.005
Come on.

21:16.811 --> 21:18.107
Come on.

22:01.687 --> 22:02.818
- Rebecca?
- No.

22:03.989 --> 22:06.224
No, not now, not while you're drunk, no.

22:20.303 --> 22:21.303
Hey.

22:22.857 --> 22:23.865
Are you all right?

22:32.093 --> 22:33.294
We'll find another way.

22:35.082 --> 22:36.082
Right, Jack?

22:37.891 --> 22:39.997
We'll-we'll find another
way to earn money.

22:47.482 --> 22:50.693
You know, I watched him,
over the years, my father.

22:52.458 --> 22:55.556
You know, whenever that
man had a... choice,

22:55.624 --> 22:59.036
a choice between doing the right
thing and doing the wrong thing...

23:01.169 --> 23:03.380
he always broke the wrong way.

23:04.599 --> 23:06.052
Like clockwork.

23:06.598 --> 23:09.974
Wrong, wrong, wrong.

23:12.122 --> 23:13.466
Every single time.

23:17.917 --> 23:19.263
For me, you know... I...

23:21.809 --> 23:23.357
tried to go the other way.

23:25.170 --> 23:27.865
Be respectful to women,
do my part in 'Nam,

23:28.634 --> 23:30.083
just be a good man.

23:31.732 --> 23:33.255
And look where it's gotten me.

23:42.506 --> 23:44.294
When am I gonna get my break, Darryl?

23:46.579 --> 23:47.579
When?

23:49.493 --> 23:50.893
You know, 'cause they just, they...

23:52.121 --> 23:53.966
they make this too hard, man.

23:55.129 --> 23:56.849
It's just too damn hard.

24:06.938 --> 24:09.349
Next week, we're going back to that bar,

24:10.191 --> 24:12.310
and one way or another,
we're getting our money back.

24:13.682 --> 24:15.851
Yeah, I'm gonna take the life
that I was supposed to have,

24:15.856 --> 24:17.724
instead of waiting for
it to come and find me.

25:05.126 --> 25:07.185
You have one unheard message.

25:07.718 --> 25:09.146
Jack, are you home?

25:09.882 --> 25:11.466
Um, I was hoping...

25:16.965 --> 25:18.622
I don't really know what to say.

25:46.993 --> 25:48.857
I'll call him in the
morning and apologize.

25:49.450 --> 25:50.575
Obviously, I'll...

25:52.895 --> 25:53.950
I'll fix this.

25:57.821 --> 26:00.482
I'm... gonna go to some
meetings, get help.

26:01.429 --> 26:03.419
How long has it been going on, Jack?

26:04.524 --> 26:05.622
The drinking?

26:07.427 --> 26:08.497
A few weeks.

26:11.232 --> 26:12.232
Wow.

26:14.866 --> 26:16.005
I had no idea.

26:18.018 --> 26:19.708
Yeah, well, you haven't
really been around.

26:19.714 --> 26:20.714
Oh.

26:20.908 --> 26:22.732
Got it. Awesome. Thank you.

26:27.643 --> 26:29.607
You drive the kids around drunk, Jack?

26:29.613 --> 26:30.427
Of course not.

26:30.433 --> 26:32.654
Of course not. You just
drove to my show drunk.

26:33.095 --> 26:36.669
That would be... some way to leave us.

26:36.724 --> 26:38.990
You know? Three teenagers, and you...

26:38.996 --> 26:40.005
Yeah. Well...

26:41.388 --> 26:42.935
Sometimes people relapse.

26:42.941 --> 26:45.825
You're not a drunk, Jack. You're not.

26:45.893 --> 26:48.427
You drank too much for
one year, seven years ago,

26:48.495 --> 26:49.764
and then you stopped cold turkey.

26:49.769 --> 26:52.765
But I do find it convenient
that this alcoholism of yours

26:52.833 --> 26:55.427
has suddenly rematerialized
at the exact same moment

26:55.433 --> 26:57.301
that I finally have something
happening for myself.

26:57.306 --> 26:58.519
No, no, that is... that is

26:58.525 --> 26:59.818
- completely unfair.
- Okay...

26:59.824 --> 27:01.129
That is completely untrue

27:01.135 --> 27:02.654
- and completely unfair.
- All right.

27:03.529 --> 27:06.107
- My father was a...
- Yes, I know.

27:11.260 --> 27:13.862
What happened with Ben? Hmm?

27:15.939 --> 27:17.365
He tried to kiss me.

27:18.580 --> 27:19.591
And?

27:22.896 --> 27:25.325
And... I'm sorry.

27:25.331 --> 27:26.931
Are you... are you kidding me right now?

27:27.122 --> 27:29.122
Are you actually serious?

27:30.924 --> 27:32.216
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

27:32.222 --> 27:34.773
Great conversation, Rebecca.
Great way to hash this out.

27:34.779 --> 27:37.036
First time in years that
I had something for myself.

27:37.042 --> 27:41.149
The first time in years
that I was... Mm.

27:42.041 --> 27:43.063
Say it.

27:43.069 --> 27:44.069
No.

27:44.086 --> 27:45.321
No, go ahead and say it!

27:45.327 --> 27:46.860
First time in years, what?

27:47.477 --> 27:49.305
That you were fulfilled? Go ahead.

27:49.311 --> 27:52.899
Go ahead and say it out loud...
that we don't fulfill you.

27:53.586 --> 27:55.486
Go ahead and say it out
loud, that your life is...

27:55.491 --> 27:58.500
I have no life! I have zero life, Jack.

27:58.506 --> 28:00.688
I am a housewife to three teenagers

28:00.694 --> 28:02.000
who do not need me anymore.

28:02.013 --> 28:03.830
And I have a husband who
waltzes in every night

28:03.835 --> 28:06.461
at 8:00, if I'm lucky,
goes to the kitchen,

28:06.467 --> 28:10.036
recaps his day for me, and then
passes out upstairs at 10:00.

28:10.042 --> 28:11.643
I have no life.

28:11.649 --> 28:13.586
I am a friggin' ghost!

28:14.750 --> 28:17.235
Wow. Wow. Well, you know what?
That is something.

28:17.772 --> 28:19.852
Uh-uh. No, no, no, no, no.

28:19.858 --> 28:22.329
Admit to me that you hated the fact

28:22.335 --> 28:24.791
that I had something
happening for myself.

28:24.797 --> 28:26.360
- I hated that you lied...
- No.

28:26.366 --> 28:28.196
...about working with your ex-boyfriend.

28:28.202 --> 28:29.289
No, that's total BS, Jack.

28:29.295 --> 28:30.540
You hated the fact that
I was singing again.

28:30.545 --> 28:31.323
I was fine with it.

28:31.329 --> 28:33.196
You didn't want me to have a career.

28:33.202 --> 28:34.408
- You never did.
- Career? You...

28:34.413 --> 28:37.869
You are a 40-year-old woman
singing covers in pubs!

28:37.875 --> 28:39.782
That is not a career, Rebecca.

28:39.788 --> 28:41.368
That is ridiculous!

28:41.518 --> 28:43.987
And the fact that...
the fact that I am...

28:43.993 --> 28:48.039
I am supporting this family
financially and emotionally,

28:48.045 --> 28:51.016
and still I am being attacked
for not being supportive...

28:51.022 --> 28:53.579
that makes me want to ram
my head through a damn wall!

28:53.585 --> 28:55.547
Wow... let your father out, Jack.

28:55.553 --> 28:57.375
Let him out. Doesn't that feel good?

28:57.381 --> 28:59.049
Doesn't it feel good to... to let go

28:59.055 --> 29:00.486
- of the whole Mr. Perfect charade?
- I have always given you

29:00.491 --> 29:01.784
everything that you wanted. I have...

29:01.789 --> 29:03.705
- sacrificed for this family.
- You've sacrificed?

29:03.710 --> 29:05.322
- You've sacrificed?
- Yet you don't know the half of

29:05.327 --> 29:06.865
the load that I have had to carry.

29:06.871 --> 29:08.263
Was it hard for you to
make every decision

29:08.268 --> 29:09.728
- for this family, and watch me follow?
- You don't know the things...

29:09.733 --> 29:11.359
- You don't know what I've given up.
- No, no, no.

29:11.364 --> 29:12.658
You don't know the
things I've had to do.

29:12.663 --> 29:14.095
- You want a family.
- The crap that I've had to eat.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.123
You want a house, you want a kid.
And I followed, followed, followed.

29:16.128 --> 29:18.500
- But you sacrificed?
- Yeah, yeah, I devoted my life to you

29:18.506 --> 29:20.361
- so that you could have a life...
- Jack, that is absolutely ridiculous!

29:20.366 --> 29:21.734
..and you throw it in
my face. How dare you?!

29:21.739 --> 29:23.406
It is absolutely ridiculous!

29:24.872 --> 29:26.524
Hmm. You know, this is insane.

29:26.772 --> 29:28.313
This is insane.

29:28.704 --> 29:29.664
We love each other.

29:29.670 --> 29:31.524
- What do you love about me?
- Huh?

29:32.179 --> 29:34.571
What do you love about me? Tell me.

29:34.577 --> 29:36.500
The me as I am right now, not the me

29:36.506 --> 29:38.126
that you've conjured up in
your mind over the years...

29:38.131 --> 29:40.586
what do you love about
me right now, Jack?

29:45.409 --> 29:47.532
So the next time you
tell me that you love me,

29:48.709 --> 29:50.930
make sure you're not
doing it just out of habit.

29:55.994 --> 29:57.024
I'm tired.

29:59.684 --> 30:02.086
And I'm really sad,
and I'm gonna go to bed.

30:03.515 --> 30:04.696

terrible.

Give us some air.

32:23.664 --> 32:24.688
Okay.

32:43.478 --> 32:46.198
Hi. Um, I'm Rebecca Malone.

32:46.204 --> 32:48.783
This is kind of awkward, but
I'm here for a blind date.

32:48.789 --> 32:51.485
Oh, yeah. The guy said that
when he made the reservation.

32:51.553 --> 32:52.820
He sounded cute.

32:52.903 --> 32:55.250
Yeah? Is... is he here?

32:55.305 --> 32:57.592
Not yet. Do you want
to wait at the table?

32:57.659 --> 32:59.594
Really? This guy better show up.

32:59.661 --> 33:01.500
I could be at an open mic tonight.

33:01.821 --> 33:04.282
- So, do you...
- Yes.

33:04.288 --> 33:06.495
Yeah, I'll... uh, sorry, I'll sit, yeah.

33:06.501 --> 33:07.702
- Wonderful.
- Thanks.

33:07.813 --> 33:09.008
Right this way.

33:12.063 --> 33:13.431
I've been coming here all week.

33:13.436 --> 33:14.907
We follow my plan, we're good.

33:15.664 --> 33:16.664
Okay.

33:17.954 --> 33:19.829
- All right, look, let's go over it.
- Okay.

33:20.143 --> 33:21.633
Bartender's an old guy.

33:21.721 --> 33:24.102
He's not the sharpest.
Every night at 8:30,

33:24.108 --> 33:26.032
he starts to close out
at the end of his shift.

33:26.038 --> 33:28.438
He opens the register,
takes the cash out

33:28.444 --> 33:30.508
so that Ray and his guys
can come pick it up later.

33:30.797 --> 33:32.251
Now, you're gonna be watching all this

33:32.256 --> 33:33.899
from that phone booth right there.

33:34.028 --> 33:36.391
And at 8:30, when he starts closing out,

33:36.471 --> 33:38.405
you're gonna pick up the
phone and call the bar.

33:38.411 --> 33:40.579
I guarantee he's gonna
leave the register open

33:40.585 --> 33:41.783
when he goes to answer the phone.

33:41.788 --> 33:44.789
So all you got to do...
is keep him talking.

33:45.488 --> 33:46.488
All right?

33:46.532 --> 33:47.829
Then I'm gonna go around,

33:47.835 --> 33:50.258
I'm gonna collect all that
Friday happy hour cash

33:50.264 --> 33:52.032
from the register and
hightail it out of there.

33:52.037 --> 33:53.930
Before he even knows it, I'll be gone.

33:54.388 --> 33:56.188
I'm telling you, simple.

33:57.082 --> 33:58.082
Come on.

34:07.158 --> 34:08.532

Ethan.

34:42.766 --> 34:44.750
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

34:44.775 --> 34:46.149
Nice to meet you.

34:46.609 --> 34:48.429
I am sorry I am so late.

34:48.436 --> 34:49.493
It's no problem.

34:49.498 --> 34:51.172
I locked my car keys inside of my office

34:51.178 --> 34:53.460
and had to have my secretary
come let me back in.

34:53.467 --> 34:54.657
I am such an idiot.

35:07.782 --> 35:09.118
Spoke to Miguel.

35:10.899 --> 35:12.446
He's fine with it.

35:14.329 --> 35:15.329
Okay.

35:20.946 --> 35:22.477
What do we tell the kids?

35:23.485 --> 35:24.750
Tell them the truth.

35:26.829 --> 35:27.734
That we had a fight

35:27.802 --> 35:29.789
and that we both need a minute to...

35:30.524 --> 35:31.977
catch our breath.

35:33.188 --> 35:34.708
We're gonna screw them up.

35:35.258 --> 35:36.258
No.

35:36.477 --> 35:38.172
- Yeah.
- No, we're not.

35:38.508 --> 35:40.274
No, the kids are gonna be fine.

35:41.329 --> 35:42.949
We've shown them a healthy marriage.

35:43.017 --> 35:46.243
This is just gonna be a blip
on their radar years from now.

35:49.180 --> 35:50.625
We're their parents, Bec.

35:51.158 --> 35:52.893
We do the best we can. But at the end

35:52.960 --> 35:55.610
of the day... what happens
to them, how they turn out...

35:56.289 --> 35:57.766
that's bigger than us.

36:05.008 --> 36:06.273
I know what I want to do,

36:06.340 --> 36:08.282
you know, now that we're
back. Like, for work.

36:08.399 --> 36:10.610
Oh, yeah? You gonna
call your old boss or...

36:11.539 --> 36:13.008
No, I want to sing.

36:14.181 --> 36:16.774
Sometimes they'll make good decisions.

36:17.282 --> 36:19.119
It's just a meeting
with a director, okay?

36:19.186 --> 36:20.398
It's not like I'm gonna get the part.

36:20.403 --> 36:22.219
Don't do that. I want you to get it.

36:23.190 --> 36:25.024
Sometimes bad decisions.

36:29.727 --> 36:30.727
I love you.

36:37.930 --> 36:39.016
I love you, too.

36:42.063 --> 36:43.524
God help me.

36:48.782 --> 36:50.282
And every once in a while,

36:51.454 --> 36:53.557
they're gonna do something
that's gonna knock us

36:53.563 --> 36:54.563
off our feet.

37:18.938 --> 37:22.344
Something that exceeds
even our wildest dreams.

37:24.805 --> 37:26.094
Beth...

37:27.961 --> 37:29.547
...I want to adopt a baby.

37:34.282 --> 37:36.430
Our kids are gonna be fine.

37:37.875 --> 37:38.875
But me,

37:39.649 --> 37:42.297
I can't go back to who
I was before I met you.

37:43.539 --> 37:45.472
I mean, we all want
to own the whole thing

37:45.539 --> 37:47.140
in the end, right? That's the end goal.

37:47.208 --> 37:49.576
But, you know, each
one's got their perks.

37:49.643 --> 37:51.073
So that is the
difference between mergers

37:51.078 --> 37:52.746
and acquisitions, in a nutshell.

37:52.813 --> 37:54.860
It's my passion.

37:56.586 --> 37:57.586
Ethan...

37:59.821 --> 38:01.782
I'm so sorry. I have to go.

38:02.735 --> 38:04.562
- Did I say something wrong?
- No, no, no, no.

38:04.625 --> 38:07.894
Not at all. You seem
like a really lovely guy.

38:07.962 --> 38:10.297
But I need to be singing tonight.

38:47.696 --> 38:48.750

to have another date

39:18.499 --> 39:20.600
the... night that we met.

39:20.668 --> 39:21.868
I ever tell you that?

39:22.961 --> 39:23.875
No.

39:23.924 --> 39:25.844
The woman that sold me the Chevelle,

39:26.782 --> 39:27.891
she set me up.

39:30.993 --> 39:32.297
But then I saw you

39:32.743 --> 39:34.321
and I stood the other girl up.

39:35.836 --> 39:37.954
- I wonder who she was.
- I never have.

39:42.852 --> 39:44.782
You asked me a question before.

39:45.426 --> 39:46.593
What is it

39:46.660 --> 39:47.908
- that I love about you now.
- Jack...

39:47.913 --> 39:49.829
So I'm gonna start with the obvious.

39:49.897 --> 39:51.524
I love the mother that you are.

39:53.750 --> 39:56.305
I love that you are still

39:57.329 --> 40:00.196
the most beautiful woman in any room

40:01.805 --> 40:04.196
and that you laugh
with your entire face.

40:06.836 --> 40:09.094
I love that you dance funny...

40:10.188 --> 40:11.758
and not sexy, which...

40:12.571 --> 40:14.172
makes it even sexier.

40:15.110 --> 40:16.856
But most of all,

40:16.924 --> 40:19.149
I love that you are still

40:20.125 --> 40:22.562
the same woman who, all those years ago,

40:22.630 --> 40:25.899
ran out of a blind date
because she simply had to sing.

40:32.313 --> 40:36.266
You're not just my great
love story, Rebecca.

40:36.977 --> 40:37.977
You...

40:42.844 --> 40:44.899
You were my big break.

40:45.774 --> 40:48.547
Thank you. Thanks.

40:49.990 --> 40:51.391
And our love story,

40:51.672 --> 40:53.893
I know it may not feel
like it right now,

40:53.961 --> 40:55.024
but, baby...

40:55.102 --> 40:56.125
Hi.

40:56.868 --> 40:57.899
Hi.

40:58.532 --> 40:59.899
...I promise,

41:00.508 --> 41:02.071
it's just getting started.
