The bureau's hunch?

14:59.900 --> 15:02.858
Matt's hunch.
He abducted people.
He abducted me!

15:02.944 --> 15:04.445
He abducted Ted Sprague.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.394
Sure, the guy
with the radioactive hands?

15:06.490 --> 15:09.072
Well, it all makes
perfect sense.

Obviously.

15:21.379 --> 15:23.756
We both know he's in here.
Do we?

15:23.840 --> 15:26.923
'Cause all I know is that
l have wasted the last
three weeks of my life

15:27.010 --> 15:29.672

that you can hear
people's thoughts.

15:29.763 --> 15:31.128
And I'd liked you, Matt.

15:31.223 --> 15:34.681
I felt sorry for you,
and maybe that clouded
my judgment.

15:35.060 --> 15:39.178
But now I need
to get back to reality
and you should do the same.

15:39.856 --> 15:42.313
Go home, Matt.
We're done.

15:48.240 --> 15:50.652

16:27.445 --> 16:29.857
I know she was
your best friend
and all.

16:31.408 --> 16:34.741
You know, I actually
discovered that someone else
was my best friend,

16:35.245 --> 16:36.951
but I lost him, too.

we could be friends?

17:03.940 --> 17:06.682

to understand right now,

31:59.835 --> 32:02.451
butlhope
that one day you will.

32:03.964 --> 32:08.674
You know, your daddy,
he's gonna take real good
care of you while I'm gone.

32:16.519 --> 32:18.259
I need you
to be the strong one

32:18.354 --> 32:21.437
because I'm not
that strong right now,
okay?

32:22.316 --> 32:24.227
That's not fair.

32:27.530 --> 32:30.522
That's my son.
Can ljust give him a hug?

32:32.409 --> 32:33.865
It's just for a second,
I promise.

32:33.953 --> 32:36.365
Baby, it's all right.
It's all right.

32:37.081 --> 32:40.619
No, he needs me.
He needs me.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.287
Just let me hold him.

32:43.379 --> 32:44.835
Stay right there.
He needs me.

32:44.922 --> 32:47.038
I said stay there.
Please.

32:47.133 --> 32:50.375
l'm warning you!
Please. Just for a moment.

32:52.054 --> 32:53.555
(GATE BUZZING)

32:54.473 --> 32:56.088
MAN: Go, move!
Wait! ljust want
to see my son!

32:56.183 --> 32:58.344
Against the wall!
Mom!

32:58.435 --> 32:59.971
I just wanted
to see my son.

33:00.062 --> 33:01.563
MAN: Your hands.

33:03.023 --> 33:04.103
Easy.

33:18.998 --> 33:21.705
I don't even know
what she fed you.

33:23.294 --> 33:26.912
They eat crickets.
Lots of crickets.

33:28.424 --> 33:31.882
You?
I hope you don't mind.
I let myself in.

33:32.511 --> 33:34.752
Have you come
to kill me, now?

33:35.264 --> 33:36.754
That depends.

33:37.683 --> 33:40.595
I'd like to talk
to you about Eden.

33:41.437 --> 33:42.893
She worked for me.

33:42.980 --> 33:44.186
Don't you mean
Sarah Ellis?

33:44.273 --> 33:46.514
She gave up that name
and that life
a long time ago,

33:46.609 --> 33:47.849
and she was a good person.

33:47.943 --> 33:50.810
Yes, of course, all spies
are very good people,
just misunderstood.

33:50.905 --> 33:53.942
She cared about you
more than she should have.

33:54.158 --> 33:56.740
She was special.

33:56.952 --> 33:59.284
She had an ability?
What was it?

33:59.371 --> 34:02.329
Suffice it to say,
she learned how to
use it wisely.

34:02.416 --> 34:05.123
Not everyone who
has these abilities
deserves them.

34:05.211 --> 34:06.451
And who are you to judge?

34:06.545 --> 34:09.582
In fact, who are you, period?
I made a mistake.

34:10.299 --> 34:12.039
I should have come to you
a long time ago.

34:12.134 --> 34:13.920
You've been spying
on me for weeks,

34:14.011 --> 34:16.047
in India, my cab,
bugging my phone.

34:16.138 --> 34:18.720
We need to help
each other, Dr. Suresh.

34:18.807 --> 34:20.934
And why would I help you?

34:25.606 --> 34:27.346
You need me, don't you?

34:27.441 --> 34:29.227
My father,
he knew more than you do.

34:29.318 --> 34:30.774
From what we can
observe, yes.

34:30.861 --> 34:33.728
If you've been watching,
then you know my father's
formula doesn't work.

34:33.822 --> 34:35.983
We both know
that he generated a list.

34:36.075 --> 34:38.487
Who's on that list
is a matter
of grave importance.

34:38.577 --> 34:40.738
You've come for it?
You want to find them?

34:40.829 --> 34:44.071
I'm glad you seem so worried.
Are you on the list?

34:45.793 --> 34:49.251
You no doubt realize
things can go terribly wrong
with these abilities.

34:49.338 --> 34:52.045
If you work with me
we can control that.

34:52.132 --> 34:54.623
If, and when,
I do figure out this list,

34:54.718 --> 34:58.586
the first thing
I'm going to do is warn
these people about you.

34:59.848 --> 35:02.430
Together, we could actually
make a difference.

35:02.518 --> 35:04.383
Sorry, not interested.

35:17.449 --> 35:20.941
Contact me when you
change your mind.

35:23.539 --> 35:26.372
The access number
is on the back.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.104
Are you back?

35:52.234 --> 35:53.223
Yeah.

35:56.405 --> 35:58.646
I took out that suitcase
this morning

35:58.741 --> 36:00.948
butlhavent
packedityet

36:14.465 --> 36:17.172
I know that
we're in trouble.

36:17.926 --> 36:22.135
And I know
that a lot of it is my...
Most of it is my fault.

36:22.222 --> 36:25.510
Janice, we need to start
being completely honest
with each other.

36:25.601 --> 36:28.013
Come clean about everything.
Okay.

36:28.103 --> 36:31.391
'Cause there's something
I've gotta tell you.
Something has happened to me.

36:31.482 --> 36:36.021
Something that's really
hard to explain.

36:36.111 --> 36:39.444
Justsayit
I can hear people's thoughts.

36:41.408 --> 36:42.864
Meaning what?

36:44.620 --> 36:47.828
I hear their thoughts,
what they're thinking.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.246
It started a few weeks ago.

36:50.334 --> 36:52.450
That's why I've been
with the PB!
all this time.

36:52.544 --> 36:55.707
Well, what do you mean,
like a psychic or something?

36:55.798 --> 36:59.040
I don't know. I guess.

37:00.928 --> 37:02.964
You can't be serious.
Yeah.

37:06.141 --> 37:07.972
You don't believe me.
Okay, that's alright.

37:08.060 --> 37:10.472
Here, come here, come here,
come here, come here.

37:13.148 --> 37:16.732
All right, pick a number

37:16.819 --> 37:19.777
between one and a million.

37:21.198 --> 37:22.859
(GIGGLING)

37:23.367 --> 37:25.153
Come on, bring it on.

38:08.162 --> 38:10.619
(LAUGHING)

38:30.559 --> 38:34.097
I took his power, Nathan.
I can't control it.

38:34.188 --> 38:36.053
Let me help you, Peter.

38:36.899 --> 38:38.105
I can't.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.186
I'm not leaving you.

38:42.821 --> 38:43.856
No!

38:47.576 --> 38:49.737
(SCREAMING)

38:57.836 --> 38:59.292
(SCREAMING)

39:01.673 --> 39:03.504
(PANTING)

39:08.931 --> 39:11.297
Ma, where is he?

39:11.391 --> 39:13.177
l have no idea.
He woke up.

39:13.268 --> 39:16.305
He woke up?
Yes, he was raving.

39:16.396 --> 39:19.058
After two weeks spent
sitting at his bedside

39:19.149 --> 39:22.482
thinking he could die,
he says he's got
to get away.

39:22.611 --> 39:25.227
You just let him leave?
No, ljust did not
let him leave,

39:25.322 --> 39:27.654
and when I see him
lwill kill him.

39:27.741 --> 39:30.949
Mom, all right, look,
just go home, okay?

39:31.328 --> 39:34.286
Get some rest.
I'll take care of it.

39:35.582 --> 39:39.416
You're really
Hiro Nakamura from
lsaac's comic book?

39:40.587 --> 39:43.044
I work there,
at Yamagata.

39:43.131 --> 39:44.792
And we fly here,

39:46.051 --> 39:48.463
and we drive that
car everywhere.

39:48.554 --> 39:51.842
Blue Nissan Versa.
lt's parked outside
right now.

39:52.057 --> 39:56.016
I'm just like Mr. lsaac
draw me, except my face
not so round.

39:56.853 --> 40:00.721
Okay. Yeah.
I give up.

40:00.816 --> 40:03.398
The world is insane.
I'm not gonna keep
ﬁghﬂngit

40:03.485 --> 40:07.603
You can paint the future.
And he needs a sword.

40:07.698 --> 40:10.405
This guy, Linderman,
he's a client of mine,
a huge collector.

40:10.492 --> 40:13.074
He buys every painting
of lsaac's he can.

40:13.161 --> 40:14.992
I can get you in there.

40:15.080 --> 40:17.992
Get your car.
You're going back to Vegas.

40:19.126 --> 40:23.540
Yeah, I need the first flight
out of New York
into the desert.

40:24.923 --> 40:27.039
I don't know.
Nevada, maybe?

40:29.344 --> 40:31.426
That's where they did
all those nuclear
bomb tests, right?

40:34.433 --> 40:37.550
Yeah, Las Vegas.
Las Vegas is good.
That... Yeah, whatever.

40:41.857 --> 40:43.643
Yeah, I'll hold.

40:52.200 --> 40:54.031
(LAUGHING)

40:59.166 --> 41:02.158
Hey! Hey!

41:04.212 --> 41:05.201
Hey!

41:07.382 --> 41:09.794
What are you doing?
Hey!

41:11.637 --> 41:13.423
You can see me?
You?

41:15.390 --> 41:17.051
Nobody sees me!

41:17.267 --> 41:19.007
Do you hear me?

41:20.395 --> 41:23.057
Nobody sees me.
I'm invisible.

41:29.863 --> 41:32.229
MOH/NDER: In the beginning,
there was discovery.

41:32.824 --> 41:34.280
A confusion of elements.

41:35.911 --> 41:39.074
The first snowfall
of impossible change.

41:41.041 --> 41:44.158
Old lives undone,
left behind.

41:48.256 --> 41:51.419
Strange faces, made familiar.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.129
New nightmares
to challenge sleep.

41:58.725 --> 42:01.102
New friends
to feel safe with.

42:01.770 --> 42:04.227
Only then
comes control.

42:04.731 --> 42:07.814
The need to impose
order onto chaos.

42:07.901 --> 42:11.519
Through determination,
through study,
through struggle.

42:11.613 --> 42:13.353
She's gonna be okay.

42:13.907 --> 42:15.693
You know that, right?

42:18.203 --> 42:20.615
You'd tell me
the truth, right?

42:20.706 --> 42:23.914
MOH/NDER: All in defiance
of a thundering truth.

42:24.418 --> 42:28.661
They’re here,
and the Earth shudders
underfoot.

42:28.964 --> 42:30.955
Oh, God.

42:31.550 --> 42:32.756
MAN: Lights out.

42:32.843 --> 42:34.549
Please help me.

42:39.975 --> 42:42.341
JESSICA: Who needs God
when you've got me?
