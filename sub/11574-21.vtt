WEBVTT

00:19.020 --> 00:21.261
She saved my life, Trick.

00:21.355 --> 00:25.564
Jumped in front of a Garuda
sword like it was nothing.

00:25.651 --> 00:27.767
A noble sacrifice.

00:27.862 --> 00:30.023
She'd be proud to know
it made a difference.

00:30.114 --> 00:32.355
Such a great photo of her.

00:32.450 --> 00:36.159
Fairies are so photogenic.
It was hard to pick just one.

00:36.245 --> 00:38.782
Dyson sent over a whole box.

00:40.166 --> 00:42.532
Don't think he could bear
to go through it himself.

00:42.627 --> 00:45.494
I should have picked him up so
he wouldn't have to come alone.

00:45.588 --> 00:47.328
If he comes.

00:47.423 --> 00:50.415
Dude fought like stink.
He's still recovering from the battle.

00:50.509 --> 00:54.127
It's a heavy burden,
losing someone you love.

00:54.222 --> 00:55.678
Someone you tried to save.

00:55.765 --> 00:59.428
When was the last time
you saw your bed?

00:59.518 --> 01:02.476
|'|| sleep when I figure out how
to stabilize Lachlan's Naga venom.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.976
Well, if anyone can nerd out
what we need, it's you, Doc.

01:06.067 --> 01:08.433
[MAN yelling]

01:10.321 --> 01:13.438
So, not the thing trying to kill us.

01:14.784 --> 01:16.775
This time.

01:16.869 --> 01:18.405
We need to stay on guard.

01:18.496 --> 01:21.738
The Garuda's out there
somewhere, getting ever stronger.

01:21.832 --> 01:25.199
He was plenty strong
last time he whooped us.

01:39.767 --> 01:44.010
To Ciara O'Breen, a toast.

01:44.105 --> 01:46.892
In the words of her Scathatch kin,

01:46.983 --> 01:50.976
[howling]

01:51.070 --> 01:53.561
To Ciara!

01:57.410 --> 01:59.241
We need to be honest here.

01:59.328 --> 02:01.535
Ciara died because we messed up.

02:01.622 --> 02:05.490
We need to avenge her.
We need to fix this.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.449
We need to talk.

02:11.507 --> 02:13.543
I'm listening.

02:13.634 --> 02:17.877
It's in our blood, isn't it?

02:17.972 --> 02:19.712
Our blood?

02:19.807 --> 02:23.470
Yours and mine.

02:23.561 --> 02:25.517
It's the key.

02:28.441 --> 02:30.978
To what?

02:31.068 --> 02:33.901
Victory.

02:33.988 --> 02:37.480
I know, Trick.

02:37.575 --> 02:40.191
I finally figured it out.

02:42.830 --> 02:45.116
You're my father.

02:49.670 --> 02:52.582
Life is hard when you
don't know who you are.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.585
It's harder when you
don't know what you are.

02:55.676 --> 02:58.588
My love carries a death sentence.

02:58.679 --> 03:00.761
l was lost for years,

03:00.848 --> 03:03.510
searching, while hiding,

03:03.601 --> 03:07.765
only to find that I belong to
a world hidden from humans.

03:07.855 --> 03:12.724
I won't hide anymore.
I will live the life I choose.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.532
Me, your father?

03:21.619 --> 03:25.908
From the first moment we met,
I felt like I could trust you.

03:25.998 --> 03:30.287
I knew that I could come to you
for advice and for comfort.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.744
And now with everything
bad that is happening,

03:32.838 --> 03:36.046
I look to you in a whole other way.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.124
But it isn't the time.

03:38.219 --> 03:41.382
Well, if not now, when?

03:41.472 --> 03:45.135
Trick, please.

03:45.226 --> 03:47.683
I need my father.

03:49.230 --> 03:53.599
I'm sorry, Bo. I'm not.

03:53.692 --> 03:55.148
Oh.

03:57.279 --> 03:59.531
But I was so sure.

04:01.742 --> 04:04.529
We have this bond.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.281
We do.

04:09.250 --> 04:12.367
And with good reason.

04:12.461 --> 04:16.955
Bo, I'm your grandfather.

04:19.552 --> 04:21.713
My grandfather?

04:23.722 --> 04:25.883
My grandfather?

04:28.811 --> 04:30.267
But...

04:32.398 --> 04:35.686
But this means that--
that Aife, my mom--

04:35.776 --> 04:38.609
Is my daughter.

04:38.696 --> 04:41.859
And what happened to
her is my biggest regret.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.530
And my dad?

04:43.617 --> 04:46.154
The answer to that
question still eludes me.

04:46.245 --> 04:48.201
Terrifies me.

04:50.332 --> 04:52.414
What does that make me?

04:55.546 --> 05:00.961
Strong. Smart.

05:01.051 --> 05:04.464
And more beautiful than I dared hope.

05:06.182 --> 05:10.801
After so much pain, what a gift.

05:10.895 --> 05:17.482
And to know you now,
I could just burst with pride.

05:17.568 --> 05:20.230
I have so many questions.

05:20.321 --> 05:21.811
As well you should.

05:21.906 --> 05:25.740
There's a lot to know
and to understand.

05:25.826 --> 05:30.035
--But--
--But now I need to focus
on defeating the Garuda.

05:32.416 --> 05:34.657
Tell me about our blood.

05:34.752 --> 05:38.961
We are family, but what runs
through our veins is unique.

05:39.048 --> 05:43.758
I use my blood to write the laws,
to manipulate the future.

05:43.844 --> 05:45.004
And my blood?

05:45.095 --> 05:49.384
It has the power to enslave others.
To bind them to your will.

05:49.475 --> 05:53.184
That's why Ryan became
obsessed, wanted to marry me.

05:53.270 --> 05:54.680
And you saw your mother use it

05:54.772 --> 05:58.811
to control her army of
adoring but deadly servants.

05:58.901 --> 06:01.813
I am not my mother.

06:01.904 --> 06:04.862
She--she went bad.

06:04.949 --> 06:09.409
Well, that's just it, Bo.
This kind of power is addictive.

06:09.495 --> 06:13.158
Can lead you to the
darkest places of yourself.

06:13.249 --> 06:15.786
Go too far and you
might not come back.

06:15.876 --> 06:19.915
Extreme times call for
extreme measures.

06:20.005 --> 06:22.291
You want to make this up to me?

06:22.383 --> 06:27.047
Help summon the other Fae
who keeps things from me.

06:27.137 --> 06:29.128
The Nain Rouge.

06:29.223 --> 06:30.929
How do you propose we do that?

06:31.016 --> 06:33.348
She's been watching me.

06:33.435 --> 06:37.019
She likes observing tragic events.

06:40.317 --> 06:43.184
Like the funeral of a Faerie queen.

06:48.325 --> 06:50.862
Show yourself, you brat!

06:58.252 --> 07:00.994
[inaudible]

07:01.088 --> 07:02.794
[WOMAN 1] There's so many
rumours going around.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.166
[WOMAN 2] Yeah.

07:04.258 --> 07:07.796
[crowd murmuring]

07:07.886 --> 07:09.092
He came.

07:09.179 --> 07:12.546
Course he did. It's Dyson.

08:03.484 --> 08:07.022
Whiskey? My treat.

08:07.112 --> 08:12.027
You buying me a drink, huh?
It really must be the end of the world.

08:16.705 --> 08:19.117
You don't have to pretend with me.

08:22.753 --> 08:26.337
It's not weak to let it out,
Dyson, it's human.

08:28.592 --> 08:32.926
What I meant was it takes
strength to express your pain,

08:33.013 --> 08:35.299
so that you can go on.

08:37.434 --> 08:40.642
All this and Nadia, too.

08:40.729 --> 08:43.061
I'm sorry, Lauren.

08:43.148 --> 08:44.763
Thank you.

08:46.902 --> 08:49.689
And you...

08:49.780 --> 08:53.648
Never got a chance to thank
you for coming back for me.

08:53.742 --> 08:55.448
Don't know how the hell you did it.

08:55.536 --> 09:00.326
| improvised. Broke the
heel of my favourite boots.

09:00.416 --> 09:04.250
Hey, let's put it behind us.

09:04.336 --> 09:09.376
If we don't figure out how to
work together, we're all toast.

09:09.466 --> 09:11.297
I'm sorry about that.

09:11.385 --> 09:14.127
That's not what I meant.

09:14.221 --> 09:16.177
It's not your fault, man.

09:16.265 --> 09:18.426
Then whose fault is it?

09:20.018 --> 09:21.599
Excuse me.

09:25.149 --> 09:27.265
I want real answers, damn it.

09:27.359 --> 09:29.520
That's not how it's done.

09:29.611 --> 09:33.399
The Garuda is winning.
And we are broken.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.867
You get off on it, don't you?

09:35.951 --> 09:39.284
Watching others try and fail
while you hide in the shadows!

09:39.371 --> 09:40.702
[TRICK] Bo, please.

09:40.789 --> 09:42.074
Show yourself already, you little--

09:42.166 --> 09:46.455
Only I choose when to appear to others.

09:46.545 --> 09:48.501
|t's tradition.

09:48.589 --> 09:50.750
Bo hates tradition.

09:52.718 --> 09:56.131
From now on, we're
doing things my way.

09:56.221 --> 09:58.883
How do | defeat the Garuda?

09:58.974 --> 10:03.468
| merely observe important events.
I don't provide counsel.

10:03.562 --> 10:07.350
Besides, I thought you preferred
listening to the wolf spirit,

10:07.441 --> 10:10.933
since her advice is so stellar.

10:11.028 --> 10:14.191
Oh, wait, it almost got you all killed.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.737
That's my fault.

10:15.824 --> 10:19.112
Though I'm still racking my brain
as to why the wolf spirit lied to Dyson.

10:19.203 --> 10:20.739
She spoke the truth.

10:20.829 --> 10:23.741
The wolf's role in the
fight will be significant.

10:23.832 --> 10:26.118
Dyson misinterpreted her message.

10:26.210 --> 10:30.169
That's because all the two
of you do is talk in riddles.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.833
You like to watch.

10:35.928 --> 10:37.793
| get it.

10:37.888 --> 10:39.503
We've all got our kinks.

10:39.598 --> 10:41.384
Bo, she's just a kid.

10:41.475 --> 10:45.434
She's Fae, like the rest of us.

10:50.943 --> 10:56.939
If I don't stop him, the last
thing you will ever observe

10:57.032 --> 11:01.901
are the Garuda's teeth bearing
down on your pretty little face.

11:08.627 --> 11:11.835
You're right, I'm scared.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.751
So, talk.

11:15.843 --> 11:17.174
No more riddles.

11:17.261 --> 11:20.128
The Garuda is the enemy of the Fae.

11:20.222 --> 11:22.759
A champion, the saviour of them all.

11:22.850 --> 11:25.762
To defeat him, you must
present a united front.

11:25.853 --> 11:29.266
Well, we've had our problems,
but I know I can lead the team.

11:29.356 --> 11:32.143
A team of the Light can
only provide half an army.

11:32.234 --> 11:34.270
You must recruit the Dark.

11:34.361 --> 11:37.853
One whose abilities rival your own.

11:37.948 --> 11:39.939
Choose wisely.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.024
I know who we need.

11:43.620 --> 11:46.862
You better hightail it
back to limbo, sweetie,

11:46.957 --> 11:50.245
or somewhere as far away
from the Garuda as you can get.

11:50.335 --> 11:57.047
And, Bo, when you do meet
our enemy, kick his feathered ass.

12:03.765 --> 12:06.142
There's not as many
people as I thought.

12:06.226 --> 12:09.969
Lachlan wasn't very well-known...

12:10.063 --> 12:12.054
...or very liked.

12:14.318 --> 12:17.936
If they only knew he died so we'd
have a chance against the Garuda.

12:18.030 --> 12:21.113
I'm sure a lot of Fae are fleeing town.

12:22.576 --> 12:24.783
Which just leaves us...

12:27.706 --> 12:29.037
...and the cockroaches.

12:29.124 --> 12:30.989
The Morrigan. Bo, no.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.336
l have to. You go ahead.

12:33.420 --> 12:36.036
Oh, honey, black leather again?

12:36.131 --> 12:38.292
Mix it up now and then.

12:38.383 --> 12:41.216
And what better time
than a blowout like this?

12:41.303 --> 12:42.884
Don't you ever let up?

12:42.971 --> 12:45.178
Join the Dark and see.

12:46.600 --> 12:49.182
I need your help.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.179
|'m flattered.

12:50.270 --> 12:52.135
--I need Vex.
--You're kidding.

12:52.230 --> 12:54.687
| wish I was.

12:54.775 --> 12:57.016
Vex is in my dungeon.

12:57.110 --> 13:00.568
And I intend to keep him there.

13:00.656 --> 13:02.442
Forever.

13:03.992 --> 13:07.405
But you and Vex are
like an evil Hall and Oates.

13:07.496 --> 13:08.986
They're not evil?

13:09.081 --> 13:11.288
After everything that
Vex has done to you,

13:11.375 --> 13:13.411
after everything you guys
have done to each other,

13:13.502 --> 13:17.711
what could Vex have possibly done that's
bad enough to land him in prison?

13:17.798 --> 13:19.629
You haven't heard?

13:22.552 --> 13:24.804
You swear?

13:31.520 --> 13:35.104
Sometimes, it's good to let it out.

13:35.190 --> 13:40.230
Oh, Paulo. You're awful.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.935
Do you not want to see my resume?

13:42.030 --> 13:45.614
Oh, is that how you want to play it?

13:45.701 --> 13:48.283
Oh, you naughty boy.

14:00.549 --> 14:06.385
If you come work for my organization,
the perks will be plenty.

14:08.181 --> 14:12.675
I will make all your dreams come true.

14:13.979 --> 14:19.474
Uh... thank you so much. Yeah, I'm
definitely willing to start on the bottom.

14:19.568 --> 14:23.902
And what a fine bottom it is.

14:23.989 --> 14:26.230
I'll take an entry level position--

14:26.324 --> 14:30.658
You'll "entry" in whatever
position I choose.

14:30.746 --> 14:35.456
'Cause I'm always the one in control.

14:45.302 --> 14:46.587
[MC HAMMER'S "U Can't Touch This"]

14:46.678 --> 14:48.088
Whoa!

14:51.391 --> 14:53.552
What's happening?

14:53.643 --> 14:57.977
No. This blouse is silk.

14:58.065 --> 15:01.649
Yeah, everyone said that
the Morrigan was a total MILF.

15:03.653 --> 15:05.609
Try pathetic.

15:05.697 --> 15:07.904
No. No!

15:07.991 --> 15:11.233
Wait till the Centauri see this.

15:11.328 --> 15:12.613
You'll pay.

15:12.704 --> 15:15.537
Yeah? What are you going to do,
unsexy breakdance me to death?

15:15.624 --> 15:17.330
Not you.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.078
Vex!

15:19.169 --> 15:21.034
You called, m'lady?

15:21.129 --> 15:25.247
Uh, uh, uh. Now, what
shall we do for the finale?

15:25.342 --> 15:29.176
The Worm, perhaps while naked?

15:31.515 --> 15:33.506
Vex!

15:38.939 --> 15:41.146
That's unfortunate.

15:41.233 --> 15:43.224
Save it, succu-bitch.

15:43.318 --> 15:46.902
At least my moves don't
leave my lovers pureed.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.445
You are the leader of the Dark.

15:49.533 --> 15:53.867
The enemy of all Fae is coming.
It is time for the Hail Mary pass.

15:53.954 --> 15:57.321
You want to strike a deal? Fine.

15:57.415 --> 16:02.330
I need a courier to fetch me
something from the Ash's archives.

16:02.420 --> 16:04.547
You want me to steal from the Light?

16:04.631 --> 16:07.998
Well, with the Ash dead
and most Fae jumping ship,

16:08.093 --> 16:12.006
it's not like anyone's going to be
around to notice that it's missing.

16:12.097 --> 16:15.806
I need you to deliver this
to my personal quarters.

16:15.892 --> 16:21.137
And you have to swear not
to show its contents to anyone.

16:21.231 --> 16:23.688
I can't do that.

16:23.775 --> 16:25.231
What's the big deal?

16:25.318 --> 16:29.186
You're the drip who never
shuts up about being unaligned.

16:29.281 --> 16:33.320
Or you could take some
fake moral high ground

16:33.410 --> 16:38.029
and watch the Garuda slay
everyone you ever cared about.

16:44.296 --> 16:46.662
Why do | feel like I'm
not reading the fine print?

16:46.756 --> 16:51.090
Just bring me this and I will
release Vex into your custody.

17:07.027 --> 17:09.860
[BO] Looks like even the rats have left.

17:21.625 --> 17:24.162
You gotta be kidding me.

17:32.219 --> 17:34.801
[knocking]

17:34.888 --> 17:36.628
Go away!

17:36.848 --> 17:38.429
[knocking continues]

17:38.516 --> 17:40.723
I said go away!

17:42.020 --> 17:44.352
What, are you deaf?

17:44.439 --> 17:46.475
Kenzi.

17:51.154 --> 17:54.442
You like that? You want some more?

17:55.742 --> 17:57.949
'Cause I can go all night.

17:59.079 --> 18:00.615
Enough.

18:00.705 --> 18:04.789
About time. l was beginning
to think we'd really lost you.

18:08.296 --> 18:10.628
Dyson, you tried something
and it didn't work.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.627
Something redonkulous.

18:13.718 --> 18:17.381
But you didn't kill Ciara.
The Garuda did.

18:17.472 --> 18:19.463
I'm just lucky I didn't get you all killed.

18:19.557 --> 18:23.049
We made it because when shiz
got real, you fought to the end.

18:23.144 --> 18:26.136
All of that just to give up now?

18:26.231 --> 18:29.974
What, did the Norn also
take your cojones? Huh?

18:32.737 --> 18:35.023
Actually, uh...

18:35.115 --> 18:38.448
What? When?

18:41.288 --> 18:45.247
Oh, you made a joke.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.824
I guess you bring out the worst in me.

18:47.919 --> 18:50.581
We got to get back the best of you.

18:50.672 --> 18:53.004
Bo can't do this without you.

19:01.433 --> 19:07.895
Dyson again. What a
glutton for punishment.

19:07.981 --> 19:15.069
Your pain makes possessing that which
is most precious to you all the sweeter.

19:15.155 --> 19:17.237
You practise that speech in the shower?

19:17.324 --> 19:22.864
How dare you bring this.

19:24.372 --> 19:30.743
My dwelling has never been
soiled by a human presence.

19:30.837 --> 19:33.123
I need my love back, Norn.

19:36.259 --> 19:39.126
l'm nothing without it.

19:39.220 --> 19:43.008
You are as incorrigible as a puppy.

19:43.099 --> 19:46.808
I ought to rap your nose
with a newspaper.

19:46.895 --> 19:49.386
This is selfless request.

19:50.732 --> 19:54.145
I need to become whole to help the
champion defeat the coming darkness

19:54.235 --> 19:56.362
before it consumes us all.

19:56.446 --> 20:02.066
Well, sacred tree has
weathered many a storm.

20:02.160 --> 20:08.622
It and I will still be standing long
after the Garuda has had his fun.

20:08.708 --> 20:09.788
Wait.

20:09.876 --> 20:13.915
What if we have something
more valuable to trade?

20:14.005 --> 20:18.590
This belonged to a Faerie Warrior.
Surely, that is worth something.

20:18.676 --> 20:21.053
You stole Ciara's bracelet?

20:21.137 --> 20:23.002
She would have wanted
to be buried with that.

20:23.098 --> 20:25.305
This is what she would have wanted.

20:25.392 --> 20:28.759
She fought and died for you,
Dyson, for all the Fae.

20:28.853 --> 20:32.345
If they fall against the Garuda,
her sacrifice means diddly squat.

20:32.440 --> 20:37.184
Genuine iridium. Very rare.

20:37.278 --> 20:40.896
And the one who wore it
had a gifted essence.

20:44.285 --> 20:50.827
and it is definitely not as
powerful as a wolf's only love.

20:54.629 --> 20:56.540
No, we're still haggling.
She won't accept a first offer.

20:56.631 --> 20:57.996
That's okay, I wouldn't either, okay--

20:58.091 --> 21:02.505
Kenzi, there are rules.

21:02.595 --> 21:04.096
We're done.

21:04.180 --> 21:09.095
Humans, they never get nuance.

21:09.185 --> 21:13.178
Lady, you reek of peat moss.

21:20.572 --> 21:22.608
Trick is your grandpoppy?

21:22.699 --> 21:24.690
Oh my god, Bo, how do you feel?

21:24.784 --> 21:27.571
Elated. I mean, I finally have family.

21:27.662 --> 21:29.869
Real family that's not mean or crazy.

21:29.956 --> 21:31.992
Yeah, and Trick is the best.

21:32.083 --> 21:35.996
But I'm also kind of furious. I mean,
he lied to me, kept this from me.

21:36.087 --> 21:38.248
Owes you almost thirty
years of birthday gifts.

21:38.339 --> 21:40.125
But mostly, I just keep wondering

21:40.216 --> 21:43.925
why did he have to wait until
the end of the world to tell me.

21:44.012 --> 21:45.548
And the case?

21:45.638 --> 21:47.754
I'm supposed to deliver
it to the Morrigan, ASAP.

21:47.849 --> 21:50.010
God, | feel like Chicken Little.

21:50.101 --> 21:51.841
"You taught you taw a puddy cat?"

21:51.936 --> 21:56.145
No, that is Tweetie Bird
and a terrible impression.

21:57.317 --> 22:00.559
No. I'm trying to tell everyone
that the sky is falling.

22:00.653 --> 22:03.486
That it's going to crush us
and no one believes me.

22:03.573 --> 22:06.656
Hey, I'd never bet against you.
Forget your magic box.

22:06.743 --> 22:09.405
--Hey!
--Your determination to do what's right,

22:09.496 --> 22:13.364
Fae rules be damned,
that is your real superpower.

22:15.502 --> 22:16.958
That's it.

22:18.296 --> 22:21.413
I need to hit up the hardware store.

22:21.508 --> 22:23.874
Of course you do.

22:30.683 --> 22:34.722
Darling, this mirror
makes me look thirty.

22:34.812 --> 22:36.848
Have it removed at once.

22:36.940 --> 22:37.975
I'm not your servant.

22:38.066 --> 22:40.523
Then why are you doing my bidding?

22:40.610 --> 22:42.066
Here's my end of the deal.

22:42.153 --> 22:45.395
A deal I expect you to honour.

22:45.490 --> 22:49.108
Yes, yes, I'll have Vex delivered to you.

22:49.202 --> 22:51.284
What's in there, anyway?

22:52.956 --> 22:56.039
A girl never tells.

22:56.125 --> 22:58.741
Girl?

22:58.836 --> 23:01.794
Aren't you, like, thirty?

23:08.346 --> 23:11.509
[knocking]

23:11.599 --> 23:13.214
Closed!

23:13.309 --> 23:15.425
[chainsaw revving]

23:29.826 --> 23:32.067
What in Gaia's name are you doing?

23:32.161 --> 23:35.028
Going for nuance.

23:35.123 --> 23:39.036
No. You cannot touch the sacred tree.

23:46.968 --> 23:50.552
I guess my bite is worse than your bark.

23:50.638 --> 23:53.630
You--you wouldn't dare.

23:53.725 --> 23:56.683
Oh, yes, I would. l'm human, remember?

23:56.769 --> 23:59.761
We drive S.U.V.'s and we dump
raw sewage into pretty lakes

23:59.856 --> 24:04.270
and we will burn this planet to the ground
if it means just one more cheeseburger.

24:04.360 --> 24:07.272
So, since your Fae rules
don't apply to me...

24:16.372 --> 24:19.535
What do you want, human?

24:21.252 --> 24:22.332
Dyson's love back.

24:22.420 --> 24:23.626
No!

24:23.713 --> 24:26.295
Or a sweet harvest table. Your choice!

24:26.382 --> 24:27.337
No!

24:27.425 --> 24:29.461
Fine. Timber!

24:29.552 --> 24:31.008
Stop!

24:32.680 --> 24:38.846
The wolf may have his love back!

24:41.314 --> 24:44.932
You'd be surprised how many of
my transactions involve power tools.

24:48.279 --> 24:49.940
Oh, son of a Banshee.

24:50.031 --> 24:51.896
Try your favourite succubus.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.322
Welcome to my humble abode.

24:53.409 --> 24:58.324
Humble? lt's bloody filthy.
You dirty minx.

25:00.583 --> 25:02.949
It cost me plenty to get
you out of that dark dungeon.

25:03.044 --> 25:04.625
Now you owe me, so listen up.

25:04.712 --> 25:09.797
Sure thing, love. But first, you mind
running me through your security system?

25:12.345 --> 25:13.380
You're looking at it.

25:13.471 --> 25:16.679
What, you and a butter knife? That's
what's between me and right gutting?

25:16.766 --> 25:18.006
Maybe.

25:18.101 --> 25:21.264
Do you think I made the Morrigan
my sex puppy for fun?

25:21.354 --> 25:23.515
Ew! And didn't you?

25:23.606 --> 25:25.471
I wanted her to put me in prison,

25:25.566 --> 25:29.354
because her dungeon's the only place
l was truly safe from the Red Caps.

25:29.445 --> 25:30.605
Red Caps?

25:30.697 --> 25:35.487
You're just as ignorant up here as
you are brilliant between the thighs.

25:35.576 --> 25:40.912
The Red Caps are an often drunk,
vicious Dark Fae gang of rank and file.

25:40.998 --> 25:42.659
--And they like to soak their--
--Soak their caps

25:42.750 --> 25:45.583
in the blood of their victims.
Yes, I know what Red Caps are.

25:45.670 --> 25:49.208
And they're led by a particularly
vicious chap named Duncan.

25:49.298 --> 25:51.038
That'd be me.

25:52.719 --> 25:54.755
And I brought me mates.

25:56.180 --> 26:01.095
Duncan, you got a little
something on your face.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.562
Right... there.

26:05.648 --> 26:07.388
Bad move, love.

26:07.483 --> 26:08.689
Gents.

26:17.744 --> 26:18.950
Enough!

26:19.036 --> 26:20.116
A little help?

26:20.204 --> 26:21.944
We'll be leaving then.

26:41.684 --> 26:43.049
Bo.

26:43.144 --> 26:44.930
What happened? Who did this to you?

26:45.021 --> 26:47.353
Oh, it's Red Caps.

26:47.440 --> 26:49.977
| um... I need--

26:50.067 --> 26:51.352
To heal. Yes, of course.

26:51.444 --> 26:56.734
No. No, l was going to say an aspirin.

26:59.619 --> 27:01.075
Right.

27:02.622 --> 27:04.829
It's not really that bad.

27:04.916 --> 27:07.578
Besides, Lauren, you know
that I would never--

27:07.668 --> 27:10.535
I know. I am not thinking clearly.

27:10.630 --> 27:13.542
It's the Naga venom. I've tried
every anticoagulant known to man

27:13.633 --> 27:16.591
and Fae and just no luck.

27:17.637 --> 27:19.252
Ow.

27:19.347 --> 27:22.305
I'm sorry. I shouldn't be complaining
about being stressed to you.

27:22.391 --> 27:25.929
It's okay. I like it.

27:26.020 --> 27:28.978
It makes me forget what's
waiting for us out there.

27:31.651 --> 27:32.561
Do you remember what happened

27:32.652 --> 27:34.813
when the Lich tried to
force you to feed off of me?

27:34.904 --> 27:39.022
Yeah, I sucked the chi out of
an entire room full of people.

27:39.116 --> 27:41.903
--|t scared the hell out of me.
--Me too.

27:41.994 --> 27:47.785
The worst part is I don't know how
I did it or what triggered my rage.

27:47.875 --> 27:50.912
Well, l have a hypothesis.

27:51.003 --> 27:57.044
I think it's because of
what we feel for each other.

27:57.134 --> 27:59.796
You take my breath away.

28:05.351 --> 28:08.559
[LAUREN] Breathless.

28:08.646 --> 28:10.637
Completely.

28:14.277 --> 28:18.111
That's it. That's it.

28:18.197 --> 28:22.531
The Naga venom is only
deoxygenated when it's in stasis.

28:23.661 --> 28:27.074
Um. Glad I could be of help.

28:31.961 --> 28:33.497
See you soon?

28:33.588 --> 28:35.795
See you soon.

28:38.301 --> 28:39.757
Okay.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.387
This is like an episode of Hoarders.

28:49.478 --> 28:55.439
Oh, I have received many gifts
from many Fae over the century.

28:55.526 --> 29:03.023
Their beauty. Fear.
Bravery. Goodness.

29:03.117 --> 29:05.574
Why don't you just try the
bottle marked "wolf mojo"?

29:05.661 --> 29:07.743
Oh.

29:08.831 --> 29:11.573
You will pay dearly for this.

29:11.667 --> 29:15.285
I am as old as time and twice as deadly.

29:15.379 --> 29:17.995
Must be why you're so poplar.

29:20.426 --> 29:23.463
Why do you care if Dyson
is made whole again?

29:23.554 --> 29:26.762
l have many other gifts
I could bestow upon you.

29:26.849 --> 29:29.591
Oh, step off. I know how
your game works.

29:29.685 --> 29:31.141
You offer something enticing

29:34.398 --> 29:35.934
Spoken like a true con.

29:36.025 --> 29:37.481
But it's got to be voluntary.

29:37.568 --> 29:41.152
And I'm not here to
trade anything of mine.

29:41.238 --> 29:42.694
Huh.

29:52.166 --> 29:53.622
Finally.

29:58.339 --> 29:59.795
Oh.

30:08.724 --> 30:11.181
--Ew.
--And with that,

30:11.268 --> 30:15.352
a gift has been given.

30:15.439 --> 30:16.895
Supen

30:21.821 --> 30:25.564
Chin up, Vexy. You get to play keeper.

30:25.658 --> 30:27.364
Target practice!

30:33.666 --> 30:36.999
That was a nice save, but...

30:37.086 --> 30:40.749
...I think you need a handicap.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.126
[BO] Love the new blood on your cap...

30:45.302 --> 30:47.167
...considering it's mine.

30:47.263 --> 30:49.049
Back for another round?

30:49.140 --> 30:51.005
I'm here for Vex.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.840
Sorry, love.

30:52.935 --> 30:56.519
We're busy torturing and
killing him for screwing us over.

30:59.358 --> 31:03.101
Although, we would be
willing to trade him.

31:03.195 --> 31:04.275
For what?

31:04.363 --> 31:07.400
Briefcase 229.

31:07.491 --> 31:08.606
How do you know about that?

31:08.701 --> 31:13.320
The Morrigan's been booking certain
meetings, bragging about it on Twitter.

31:13.414 --> 31:15.200
So much for discreet.

31:15.291 --> 31:16.701
You've got two hours.

31:16.792 --> 31:20.250
Have you seen the security
around her place?

31:20.337 --> 31:22.043
One hour, fifty-nine minutes.

31:22.131 --> 31:23.871
I can do it.

31:28.345 --> 31:29.881
Hang in there, Vex.

31:42.443 --> 31:44.354
What's with the chainsaw?

31:44.445 --> 31:46.811
Well, when your hairy butt's
backed against the corner

31:46.906 --> 31:51.570
and they've got you by the pelt,
that is when you really go dog-wild.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.651
Guess who taught me that?

31:58.334 --> 31:59.824
No, it's impossible.

31:59.919 --> 32:03.878
Just work it through, baby,
work it through.

32:07.510 --> 32:10.092
You got it.

32:10.179 --> 32:16.266
Yep, one chance to love again,
with a side of seriously pissed off Norn.

32:16.352 --> 32:18.217
Kenzi, what did you do?

32:19.605 --> 32:22.221
I did what I had to.

32:24.819 --> 32:26.935
You crazy human.

32:29.115 --> 32:33.529
Wait. How do we know the Norn
is not pulling a Kenzi on us?

32:33.619 --> 32:37.487
The Norn can't possibly hurt me
any more than she already has.

32:48.342 --> 32:51.334
Ahh!

32:58.853 --> 33:00.718
What are you doing here?

33:00.813 --> 33:06.149
I wasn't expecting
flannel pyjamas, but still.

33:06.235 --> 33:07.975
Wow.

33:09.196 --> 33:12.654
Wait. How did you get past security?

33:13.993 --> 33:17.360
You really need to hire better muscle.

33:17.454 --> 33:19.866
You fed off the help?

33:19.957 --> 33:22.869
A mere snack.

33:22.960 --> 33:26.293
Just enough to whet my appetite.

33:26.380 --> 33:30.168
You succubi are always so crass.

33:30.259 --> 33:35.845
So aggressive. Where's the foreplay?

33:35.931 --> 33:38.308
Where's the seduction?

33:42.271 --> 33:44.307
Evony.

33:49.069 --> 33:51.230
|t's party time.

33:57.161 --> 34:00.870
This will never work.

34:03.167 --> 34:07.001
You know, I could resist you.

34:07.087 --> 34:10.250
Why resist?

34:10.341 --> 34:16.382
We have been dancing around
this moment since the day we met.

34:22.436 --> 34:25.769
It must be hard being the boss.

34:25.856 --> 34:29.440
Always having to be on top.

34:29.526 --> 34:31.687
Don't you ever just want to surrender?

34:31.779 --> 34:35.021
Oh, you're a dead woman,

34:35.115 --> 34:37.731
who's in for a treat.

34:40.079 --> 34:41.944
Show me.

34:47.836 --> 34:50.919
Stop it. Stop it. Right there.

34:51.006 --> 34:54.919
No! Lower. Ah, yes!

34:55.010 --> 34:56.341
Like that?

34:59.306 --> 35:01.092
Oh.

35:06.772 --> 35:09.889
The pepper spray's in the drawer.

35:09.984 --> 35:12.145
Maybe next time.

35:15.155 --> 35:17.282
Wait. W-What?

35:20.911 --> 35:24.745
Oh, you won't live long
enough to regret this.

35:24.832 --> 35:29.451
Then I will take out some insurance.

35:29.545 --> 35:33.379
Of all the bad decisions
that you've made.

35:33.465 --> 35:36.172
This is the worst!

35:36.260 --> 35:43.428
Yet I would never leave
the keys to my handcuffs...

35:43.517 --> 35:45.849
...so far from the bed.

36:06.790 --> 36:09.406
You actually stole from the Morrigan?

36:09.501 --> 36:10.832
That's suicide.

36:10.919 --> 36:13.251
So I hear.

36:13.339 --> 36:15.705
Now make with my package.

36:20.220 --> 36:22.677
What did Vex do to you guys, anyway?

36:22.765 --> 36:26.178
He promised that he'd fix it
so that Exton would win the Cup.

36:27.644 --> 36:31.262
I told you, I'll get them
into the final, not win it.

36:31.357 --> 36:35.691
As if Exton could win it.
They're utter bollocks.

36:35.778 --> 36:37.439
Really? That's necessary?

36:37.529 --> 36:41.943
Go Paxford! Now there's
a squad for you.

36:42.034 --> 36:46.118
We made good on the exchange.
Gave you Vex.

36:46.205 --> 36:50.995
Now... now we're going
to kill you both.

37:03.597 --> 37:05.212
Get in line!

37:07.184 --> 37:10.051
This is worrisome.

37:10.145 --> 37:14.809
|t's exhausting sucking the
talent out of talentless people.

37:18.153 --> 37:22.362
She can do whatever that was?

37:22.449 --> 37:25.191
Why do you think
she's leader of the Dark?

37:27.287 --> 37:28.663
Stay back.

37:28.747 --> 37:30.453
That's mine.

37:30.541 --> 37:31.781
What kind of weapon is it?

37:31.875 --> 37:33.911
The kind that lets you go till dawn.

37:34.002 --> 37:36.789
Each vial contains the
secretions of the Barnacle Goose.

37:36.880 --> 37:39.713
It's the ultimate aphrodisiac.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.006
Wait.

37:42.177 --> 37:47.092
All of this is for football
and Fae Viagra?

37:47.182 --> 37:49.969
Don't you know what
is coming to devour us?

37:50.060 --> 37:53.598
All the more reason to get
your mind-blowing sex on

37:53.689 --> 37:56.146
before it's too late.

37:56.233 --> 37:58.645
| always knew the Dark was selfish,

37:58.735 --> 38:03.650
but this shallow and vain,
even in the face of extinction?

38:03.740 --> 38:04.991
Boﬁng.

38:05.075 --> 38:09.364
You know who would fight
to survive to the bitter end?

38:09.455 --> 38:11.241
Humans.

38:16.003 --> 38:21.123
You have all these so-called
powers and you are such cowards.

38:25.804 --> 38:29.547
How dare you use my Barnacle Goose!

38:29.641 --> 38:31.632
|t tingles.

38:33.479 --> 38:35.060
This won't.

38:44.072 --> 38:46.358
I'll be doing you a favour.

38:46.450 --> 38:49.783
Killing you before the Garuda can.

38:58.962 --> 39:01.044
You really do have a
death wish, don't you Vex?

39:01.131 --> 39:03.998
Oh, it's just a tap between
friends. She'll get over it.

39:04.092 --> 39:05.878
But let's not dilly dally, eh?

39:05.969 --> 39:06.958
Thank you.

39:07.054 --> 39:11.388
You really think you can
save the Fae, all of them?

39:11.475 --> 39:15.468
With you on board, I give us
slightly better odds than Exton.

39:15.562 --> 39:18.053
Let's go down swinging,
that's what I always say.

39:18.148 --> 39:18.978
Me too.

39:19.066 --> 39:22.433
But I have to warn you...

39:22.528 --> 39:24.189
...I don't play nice.

39:24.279 --> 39:25.894
l'm counting on it.

39:25.989 --> 39:29.481
What'd you say we take the sex goose?

39:29.576 --> 39:31.612
Just for giggles.

39:34.873 --> 39:36.659
Dream on.

39:45.175 --> 39:49.259
I'd like to introduce you to
the newest member of our army.

39:52.432 --> 39:53.888
Evening.

39:55.686 --> 39:56.675
Bo.

39:56.770 --> 40:02.481
We need him for reasons I will explain.

40:02.568 --> 40:08.404
But also, as of now, this
is no longer a democracy.

40:08.490 --> 40:12.199
There can only be one
champion and I'm it.

40:13.787 --> 40:16.449
I know we can beat the Garuda.

40:16.540 --> 40:20.453
And yes, l have a plan.

40:20.544 --> 40:26.414
But if you're not on board,
now is the time to leave.

40:31.722 --> 40:34.714
Um...

40:34.808 --> 40:37.766
...one more thing...

40:37.853 --> 40:46.522
I may be the champion,
but I can't do this alone.

40:46.612 --> 40:48.477
I need you.

40:50.866 --> 40:53.027
All of you.

40:55.829 --> 41:02.997
And if I haven't been clear about how
much I appreciate what you are doing

41:03.086 --> 41:08.126
and what Lachlan and Ciara did...

41:08.216 --> 41:13.131
Bo, I'm with you till the end.

41:13.221 --> 41:14.961
We all are.

41:17.517 --> 41:20.475
Won't be easy.

41:20.562 --> 41:24.396
Can't say we don't have
some stuff between us.

41:24.483 --> 41:27.270
Stuff the Garuda can feed off of.

41:30.697 --> 41:33.689
l have an idea about that, too.

41:39.122 --> 41:42.410
Damn, Kenzi, that brand is
more expensive than my car.

41:42.501 --> 41:45.038
Nah, fake label.
Stole it off the back of a truck.

41:45.128 --> 41:47.289
Oh, nothing too good for
our last night on Earth, huh?

41:47.381 --> 41:49.246
You bite your tongue.

41:49.341 --> 41:52.174
Oy, cupcakes, toothpaste?

41:52.260 --> 41:54.216
--Foot locker.
--Foot locker.

41:57.057 --> 41:59.890
And take off my kimono!

41:59.976 --> 42:01.432
God.

42:04.731 --> 42:06.141
You think we can trust him?

42:06.233 --> 42:10.272
Hell no. The things that
I did to recruit him?

42:10.362 --> 42:12.694
If we survive this, the Morrigan
will be gunning for me.

42:12.781 --> 42:14.146
We do what we got to do.

42:14.241 --> 42:15.697
Yeah.

42:20.038 --> 42:22.620
Dyson seems better.

42:22.708 --> 42:24.915
It's nice to see him
back in fighting form.

42:25.001 --> 42:27.083
Hm.

42:27.170 --> 42:31.789
You know, if it is the Fae-pocalypse,
you should go be with your girl.

42:31.883 --> 42:34.090
You shouldn't be alone, Bo.

42:34.177 --> 42:36.668
I'm not alone, Kenzi.

42:36.763 --> 42:38.628
I'm with you.

42:42.978 --> 42:46.220
This is really happening, isn't it?

42:46.314 --> 42:48.566
Yeah.

42:48.650 --> 42:51.312
But the plan will work, Kenzi.

42:51.403 --> 42:54.520
As long as there's no other surprises.
