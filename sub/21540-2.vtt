00:04.904 --> 00:06.673
- Oh, my God.

00:06.706 --> 00:09.109
I know how much
your buyers want this.

00:09.142 --> 00:10.777
- Okay, nine.
- You got a deal.

00:10.810 --> 00:13.013
- I got the whole project.
Ching-ching!

00:13.046 --> 00:14.481
- It wasn't meant to happen now.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.849
- Our doctor said,

00:15.882 --> 00:17.217
"The kids
are not there anymore."

00:17.250 --> 00:19.285
- Things happen for a reason.

00:19.319 --> 00:20.653
We both actually believe that.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.522
- Penthouse A sold.

00:22.555 --> 00:24.657
Penthouse B sold.

00:24.691 --> 00:26.860
We sold it out!
$10 million.

00:26.893 --> 00:28.728
- Wow. This is the money.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.363
- I'm thinking 16 million.

00:30.397 --> 00:31.364
- What?

00:31.398 --> 00:32.766
- And I have one condition.

00:32.799 --> 00:33.967
We need one more firm.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.702
- Okay, but I get
to pick the broker.

00:35.735 --> 00:37.404
- Yo.
- I have a concern.

00:37.437 --> 00:38.571
I found out yesterday

00:38.605 --> 00:40.407
that you signed
another listing with Soly.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.008
- I didn't steal your clients.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.209
They--they came to me.

00:43.243 --> 00:45.478
- I should have never
picked him.

<i>but then I come home</i>
<i>for a treat.</i>

01:04.464 --> 01:06.366
- I didn't steal your clients.
They came to me.

01:06.399 --> 01:07.867
- I worked really damn hard
to get here.

01:07.901 --> 01:09.836
I'm not gonna have someone
like you steal from me.

01:09.869 --> 01:11.538

Integrity is what makes you
last in this business.

01:23.416 --> 01:24.884
- Integrity?
- Yes.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.152
- That I didn't call you?

01:26.186 --> 01:27.620
- Yes,
this is a partnership

01:27.654 --> 01:29.989
that we have
that hasn't even started,

01:30.090 --> 01:31.324
and it's already f***ed.

01:31.358 --> 01:32.859
I mean, how can I
trust you from now on?

01:32.892 --> 01:35.995
<i>My listing at 57th Street,</i>
<i>it's already a fiasco,</i>

01:36.096 --> 01:38.098

on the market yet.

<i>The owner of this listing,</i>
<i>Soly,</i>

01:45.238 --> 01:49.609
<i>wanted me to partner up with</i>
<i>someone outside of my firm,</i>

01:49.642 --> 01:51.711

01:53.413 --> 01:54.981
Hello, good to see you.

01:55.015 --> 01:57.951
But later I found out
that he had signed

01:57.984 --> 02:01.187
on another project owned by Soly
without even telling me.

02:01.221 --> 02:03.890
To me, it's about integrity.

02:03.923 --> 02:06.192
- Say that one more time.
- To me, it's about integrity.

02:06.226 --> 02:07.794
- Integrity?
- Yes.

02:07.827 --> 02:10.430
- Yeah, that's dramatic.
- It's not dramatic, man.

02:10.463 --> 02:11.598
Okay, it's not
about the fact that--

02:11.631 --> 02:12.866
- You want to do
a personality test on me?

02:12.899 --> 02:14.534
- Listen to me.

02:14.567 --> 02:16.302
- Do you want to bring up
integrity, ass****?

02:16.336 --> 02:17.837
Don't bring me into this listing

02:17.871 --> 02:20.740
and try to, like,
break down my personality, no.

02:20.774 --> 02:23.243
I will bring up ten instances
in your career

02:23.276 --> 02:25.478
where you should have
done something differently.

02:25.512 --> 02:28.081
I am not in the habit
of talking

02:28.081 --> 02:30.750
about developments
and listings

02:30.784 --> 02:32.252
that I haven't fully signed yet

02:32.285 --> 02:34.721
<i>because they're projects</i>
<i>that I'm pitching.</i>

02:34.754 --> 02:36.623
It's actually none
of Luis's business.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.359
They chose me for some reason
that has nothing to do with you.

02:39.392 --> 02:40.794
- Okay, let's just
stop for a second.

02:40.827 --> 02:42.095
- Let's call them.

02:42.095 --> 02:43.196
- Let's put them on speakerphone
and ask them

02:43.229 --> 02:45.899
why they gave it to me over you.

02:45.932 --> 02:47.567
- It has nothing
to do with the fact

02:47.600 --> 02:48.802
that you have
different business,

02:48.835 --> 02:50.303
that you were chosen
for a business.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.372
I don't care. I don't want
to be part of that business.

02:52.405 --> 02:54.107
The only thing
that I expected,

02:54.107 --> 02:55.475
and maybe
I'm expecting too much,

02:55.508 --> 02:57.010
was the courtesy,

02:57.110 --> 02:59.012
the courtesy of calling me
and saying,

02:59.112 --> 03:00.613
"Listen, this seller
has chosen me

03:00.647 --> 03:02.482
to work with another project."

03:02.515 --> 03:03.717
That's the right thing to do.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.085
- It's not integrity.
It's business.

03:05.118 --> 03:06.653
- No, no, no, no.
It's not business.

03:06.686 --> 03:07.687
- Of course it is.

03:07.721 --> 03:08.788
- Listen, maybe I'm wrong,

03:08.822 --> 03:10.623
but I choose to be
right on this one.

03:10.657 --> 03:12.659
- You choose
to be right a lot.

03:16.196 --> 03:19.165
- Now, I gave my commitment
to this listing.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.067
I gave my commitment
to Soly and his partners.

03:21.101 --> 03:22.402
Soly's a very good
friend of mine,

03:22.435 --> 03:24.471
and even if I do not think
you are the right person,

03:24.504 --> 03:26.973
this partnership
will continue until the end,

03:27.073 --> 03:28.708
but it will continue
without trust,

03:28.742 --> 03:30.076
'cause I don't
trust you anymore.

03:30.076 --> 03:31.444
- Mm-hmm.

03:31.478 --> 03:34.447
- After this,
you and I are done.

03:34.481 --> 03:37.417
Maybe I'm just expecting
to be much more

03:37.450 --> 03:41.821
than you could ever be.

03:41.855 --> 03:44.491
- I don't want
to do this anymore.

03:44.524 --> 03:46.126
- You know we still
have to finish this.

03:46.159 --> 03:47.160
- Finish what?

03:47.193 --> 03:48.795
- Finish this listing
that we started.

03:48.828 --> 03:50.163
- Do you want to meet them
at Spring Street

03:50.196 --> 03:52.899
and tell them that or?

03:52.932 --> 03:54.768
- Ass****.

04:01.808 --> 04:04.577
- The apartment showing
is on Monday at 3:30.

04:04.611 --> 04:06.413
See you then.
Bye.

04:06.446 --> 04:08.048
I'm very good at telling people
what to do.

04:08.081 --> 04:11.051
People like to be told
what they should do.

04:11.051 --> 04:12.752
On that note,
take me to Bleecker.

04:12.786 --> 04:15.922
For the longest time it was all
about SoHo, SoHo, SoHo.

04:15.955 --> 04:19.225
Now it's all about
NoHo, North Houston.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.594
<i>I mean, NoHo is everything:</i>
<i>cobblestone streets,</i>

04:21.628 --> 04:23.196
<i>all the old buildings</i>
<i>and the brick</i>

04:23.229 --> 04:24.798
<i>and the retail,</i>
<i>the restaurants.</i>

04:24.831 --> 04:28.501
<i>I mean, all the cool people,</i>
<i>they want to be in NoHo.</i>

04:28.535 --> 04:29.602
Hello?

04:29.636 --> 04:31.071
- Hi, Fredrik.

04:31.071 --> 04:34.841
- I smell paint...
and a big commission for me.

04:34.874 --> 04:36.609
Now, I've been working
with Armen for three years.

04:36.643 --> 04:38.578
I mean, I was there
when he bought the building,

04:38.611 --> 04:40.880
and trust me, I was there
when I sold out

04:40.914 --> 04:42.582
almost all the units.

04:42.615 --> 04:44.084
Good job finishing it.

04:44.117 --> 04:47.087
<i>In new development, often</i>
<i>you finish the units one by one</i>

04:47.087 --> 04:49.422
<i>and sell them while the others</i>
<i>are being renovated.</i>

04:49.456 --> 04:52.092
<i>These last two are some</i>
<i>of the biggest apartments</i>

04:52.092 --> 04:53.393
in the building,
and they took, of course,

04:53.426 --> 04:56.529
the longest
to complete and stage.

04:56.563 --> 04:57.731
Gorgeous.

05:01.401 --> 05:03.336
<i>This building has been</i>
<i>on every cover:</i>

05:03.370 --> 05:04.537
<i>"Wall Street Journal,"</i>
<i>"Financial Times,"</i>

05:04.571 --> 05:06.039
<i>"New York Times."</i>

05:06.039 --> 05:07.607
<i>Everyone who's bought in here</i>
<i>is a billionaire.</i>

05:07.640 --> 05:09.109
That's a fact.

05:09.142 --> 05:12.645
<i>We're talking about</i>
<i>the "it" building of downtown.</i>

05:16.850 --> 05:18.351
It looks very expensive.

05:18.385 --> 05:20.387
- $20,000 slab right here.

05:20.420 --> 05:22.055
- So gorgeous.

05:23.223 --> 05:26.059
<i>It's so beautiful,</i>
<i>the gunmetal,</i>

05:26.059 --> 05:27.761
<i>arced windows, the wood.</i>

05:27.794 --> 05:29.062
Amazing.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.663
I mean, this is perfection.

05:30.697 --> 05:32.065
Oh, the courtyard.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.900
<i>The courtyard is</i>
<i>so fairy tale-like.</i>

05:33.933 --> 05:36.169
Vines, it's like
what's his name,

05:36.202 --> 05:37.470
Jack the bean guy?

05:37.504 --> 05:38.672
This was genius.

05:38.705 --> 05:40.073
[chuckles]

05:40.073 --> 05:41.574
<i>A conversion like this usually</i>

05:41.608 --> 05:44.144
would trade around 2,200
to 2,500 a foot.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.879
At nine and a quarter,

05:45.912 --> 05:48.415
<i>I'm asking almost 3,000 a foot,</i>

05:48.448 --> 05:52.252
but the place looks amazing.

05:52.285 --> 05:55.522
Okay, Armen, I can't wait
to see the last unit.

05:55.555 --> 05:57.090
- Yeah, let's go take a look.

05:57.090 --> 05:59.592
- It's so rewarding, because,
you know, three years ago

05:59.626 --> 06:01.661
I saw this
dilapidated printing house

06:01.695 --> 06:03.263
with boxes of paper,

06:03.296 --> 06:05.131
<i>and now it's done.</i>

06:05.165 --> 06:07.100
- So it's--
- What?

06:07.133 --> 06:08.768
- Not quite finished yet.

06:08.802 --> 06:09.836
- What do you mean,
not quite finished?

06:09.869 --> 06:11.805
It's like a bomb exploded.

06:11.838 --> 06:13.773
They're working in here.

06:13.807 --> 06:16.409
You didn't tell me that, Armen.

06:16.443 --> 06:17.744
Wait, I don't understand.

06:17.777 --> 06:20.613
The first one, beautiful,
finished, staged perfect.

06:20.647 --> 06:21.848
It even smelled good.

06:21.881 --> 06:25.185
This smells like...ew.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.619
- It's the last unit.

06:26.653 --> 06:28.254
- How the hell
am I gonna sell this?

06:30.757 --> 06:32.659
<i>This is not showable.</i>

06:32.692 --> 06:35.362
<i>I mean, it's one thing</i>
<i>to sell something unfinished,</i>

06:35.395 --> 06:37.230
but this is
billionaire's boy's club.

06:37.263 --> 06:39.733
<i>That kitchen, this kitchen--</i>
<i>the kitchen's been</i>

06:39.766 --> 06:41.167
<i>the selling point</i>
<i>in this project.</i>

06:41.201 --> 06:43.636
Here, I can't even
walk in there 'cause

06:43.670 --> 06:45.739
<i>there's so much stuff.</i>

06:45.772 --> 06:47.073
<i>It's gonna take months</i>
<i>and months</i>

06:47.107 --> 06:48.608
<i>and months for that mansion</i>
<i>to be finished.</i>

06:48.641 --> 06:50.510
Oh, no.

06:50.543 --> 06:52.212
When is all
this gonna be moved out?

06:52.245 --> 06:53.713
- When you sell it,
we'll move it out.

06:53.747 --> 06:55.448
I don't want to have
to move offsite

06:55.482 --> 06:57.117
because it's saving me money.

06:57.150 --> 06:58.752
- I mean, you also
want me to sell it,

06:58.785 --> 07:00.353
so what's more important?
I mean--

07:00.387 --> 07:02.589
- It's like selling off plans.
- No, it's not.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.024
I mean, why can't we compromise?

07:04.057 --> 07:07.594
You move everything out, and,
you know, I can show it as--

07:07.627 --> 07:09.929
- I'm not.
I'm not.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.364
- I don't like
this strategy, Armen.

07:11.398 --> 07:14.634
Luckily for me, we have the
beautiful unit staged up there.

07:14.668 --> 07:15.935
Maybe in a perfect world

07:16.036 --> 07:18.271
I can start showing them
that and then,

07:18.304 --> 07:20.473
you know, get them excited
and then bring them down here.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.042
They will get very disappointed,

07:22.042 --> 07:23.443
but I'll--you know,
I'll do my best,

07:23.476 --> 07:25.478
but please give me this.

07:25.512 --> 07:30.050
Can you please negotiate
a little bit of the 9.5?

07:30.083 --> 07:31.618
I mean, come on.

07:31.651 --> 07:33.086
- Can't compromise, Fredrik.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.356
You're gonna have
to do it as-is.

07:36.389 --> 07:38.391
- To sell it
under this pressure

07:38.425 --> 07:41.161
and then sell it at full ask?

07:41.194 --> 07:42.228
I'm screwed.

07:42.262 --> 07:44.531
I will get started.

07:44.564 --> 07:46.099
Can you broom that floor
for me?

07:46.132 --> 07:47.100
Thank you.

08:08.388 --> 08:10.156
Ohh.

08:10.190 --> 08:14.027
- Hi. Oh, I got lip gloss
on your face as usual.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.696
- I love lip gloss
on my face and everywhere else.

08:16.730 --> 08:18.765
Just kidding.

08:18.798 --> 08:21.234
<i>Emilia and I</i>
<i>have never been better.</i>

08:21.267 --> 08:23.670
How was your day?
- Super busy running around.

08:23.703 --> 08:26.639
- And recently our worlds
have converged even more

08:26.673 --> 08:29.542
because she got
into real estate,

08:29.576 --> 08:31.177
not as a broker, thank God,

08:31.211 --> 08:33.413
'cause I'd have
to crush her every day.

08:33.446 --> 08:35.115
<i>She's an attorney,</i>
<i>and she works in title</i>

08:35.148 --> 08:36.483
<i>with some very big people</i>

08:36.516 --> 08:39.919
and is able to be with me
all the time now,

08:39.953 --> 08:42.222
<i>at open houses,</i>
<i>at parties, et cetera,</i>

08:42.255 --> 08:43.890
which is great.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.125
- How's everything?

08:45.158 --> 08:47.894
- Um, I just saw Luis today
at 57th Street.

08:47.927 --> 08:50.196
- I haven't seen him in ages.

08:50.230 --> 08:52.399
- Good.

08:52.432 --> 08:54.234
He, um--
and we, like, sit down,

08:54.267 --> 08:56.302
and he brings up
Spring Street.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.071
- Mmkay.
- We just signed it up, right?

08:58.071 --> 09:01.207
Which is awesome,

09:01.241 --> 09:04.077
and then he made it all--

09:04.110 --> 09:06.780
I don't know.
He made it all personal.

09:06.813 --> 09:10.016
I mean, it totally messed up
the rest of my day.

09:10.050 --> 09:13.620
- But what are you
feeling bad about?

09:13.653 --> 09:15.121
- I don't know.

09:15.155 --> 09:17.857
<i>Honestly, I mean, I do use her</i>
<i>as a sounding board</i>

09:17.891 --> 09:20.427
because sometimes I don't know

09:20.460 --> 09:22.762
how I feel or how I've been
affected by something,

09:22.796 --> 09:25.131
and I think that's been
a big problem for me

09:25.165 --> 09:26.199
my entire life.

09:26.232 --> 09:29.436
- What's wrong?
- Nothing.

09:29.469 --> 09:33.873
- Hey.
You're never this quiet.

09:33.907 --> 09:37.243
- He said, um,
I have no integrity.

09:37.277 --> 09:39.813
I'm not a man
like he's a man.

09:39.846 --> 09:42.949
- That's what he said?
- Yes.

09:43.049 --> 09:45.051
I got up, and I just,
like, walked out.

09:45.085 --> 09:47.687
- Why?

09:47.721 --> 09:50.323
- I didn't know what to say.

09:50.357 --> 09:52.759
What am I supposed to do?

09:52.792 --> 09:54.794
This entire business
is a game of poker.

09:54.828 --> 09:56.329
You have to have a thick skin.

09:56.363 --> 09:59.065
You've got to be able
to roll with the punches,

09:59.065 --> 10:02.268
but yes, of course
I get hurt easily.

10:02.302 --> 10:03.837
Yes, of course I'm sensitive.

10:03.870 --> 10:05.505
Yes, of course I don't like it
when people say mean things

10:05.538 --> 10:08.241
about me to my face
or on the internet.

10:08.274 --> 10:10.410
It's all hurtful.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.046
I'm a human being
just like everybody else.

10:13.079 --> 10:16.149
I've never felt that way before,
like, in a professional setting.

10:16.182 --> 10:19.786
- You're so much more sensitive
than anybody realizes.

10:19.819 --> 10:20.920
You really are.

10:20.954 --> 10:23.456
Slowly we've
progressed with us,

10:23.490 --> 10:27.494
and slowly you've been showing
that a little bit more,

10:27.527 --> 10:29.062
but I think, you know,

10:29.095 --> 10:31.931
you can't show it with people
that don't really know you,

10:31.965 --> 10:34.668
especially in business.

10:34.701 --> 10:35.869
- I have been,
in the past,

10:35.902 --> 10:37.570
incredibly cutthroat,

10:37.604 --> 10:39.572
<i>but I have learned</i>
<i>from my mistakes,</i>

10:39.606 --> 10:42.375
and I have worked really hard
the past year

10:42.409 --> 10:44.611
or two putting
those days behind me.

10:44.644 --> 10:45.945
And I don't know what to do.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.614
Like, we're supposed
to go live with this thing

10:47.647 --> 10:48.648
in, like, two days.

10:48.682 --> 10:49.983
- Well, do you think

10:50.016 --> 10:51.851
that it would make you
feel better if you said that?

10:51.885 --> 10:53.853
- To who? To Luis?
- Yeah.

10:53.887 --> 10:55.155
- What am I supposed to do now?

10:55.188 --> 10:57.757
Like, call a meeting with Luis
to talk about feelings?

10:57.791 --> 10:58.992
Are you kidding me?
Like,

10:59.025 --> 11:00.593
"Would you like to come
have some tea?"

11:02.062 --> 11:04.397
<i>Coming up...</i>
Everyone have clients for this?

11:04.431 --> 11:06.166
I don't care
what personal drama's going on.

11:06.199 --> 11:07.834
I'm gonna sell
this f***ing penthouse

11:07.867 --> 11:09.436
whether he likes it or not.

11:09.469 --> 11:11.738
- Maybe we're just trying
to control the process too much.

11:11.771 --> 11:13.073
- I'm torn.

11:13.106 --> 11:14.974
- You've always had a dream
about having a daughter,

11:15.075 --> 11:16.710
but maybe you're destined
to have a son.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.150
<i>[upbeat pop music]</i>

11:33.293 --> 11:33.626
- Babe, look.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.896
I mean, this is insane.

11:36.930 --> 11:39.099
Happy anniversary.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.368
I've been so busy preparing
for my big open house

11:41.401 --> 11:42.969
at my new listing
at Bleecker...

11:43.003 --> 11:44.904
Nicole, hi,
Fredrik Eklund here.

11:44.938 --> 11:47.307
I'm calling every
single broker personally.

11:47.340 --> 11:49.642
It's all about
that personal touch.

11:49.676 --> 11:53.413
But tonight, I'm taking Derek
to the most iconic place

11:53.446 --> 11:56.516
in all of New York,
the Rainbow Room.

11:56.549 --> 11:58.184
Can you believe
it's been five years?

11:58.218 --> 11:59.386
- I think
the last five years

11:59.419 --> 12:02.489
have been the happiest
five years of my life.

12:02.522 --> 12:05.358
- I mean, really,
I lived my whole life

12:05.392 --> 12:08.795
to sit here with Derek
celebrating our love.

12:08.828 --> 12:12.098
But I want to thank you
for making me

12:12.132 --> 12:14.467
better every day 'cause

12:14.501 --> 12:15.769
I feel like I took it so hard

12:15.802 --> 12:18.972
and it was so difficult
for me with the babies.

12:21.241 --> 12:25.111
- Well...I think
we should try it again.

12:25.145 --> 12:27.714
I think we should give it
a second shot.

12:31.184 --> 12:34.387
- I'm torn,
because I know, of course,

12:34.421 --> 12:36.089
we have to to have kids,

12:36.089 --> 12:39.092
but it also opens up
for another disappointment.

12:39.092 --> 12:42.595
- I think we should at least
try two again

12:42.629 --> 12:44.864
and hope that
if we don't get both,

12:44.898 --> 12:47.000
that we at least get one.

12:47.100 --> 12:50.904
- What are you suggesting
we--we have a girl embryo

12:50.937 --> 12:52.505
with you left.

12:52.539 --> 12:55.642
We have one last girl with me,

12:55.675 --> 12:57.110
and then I have five boys,

12:57.110 --> 12:58.345
as you know.

12:58.378 --> 13:00.180
I mean, it's so crazy
and so many decisions.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.315
We have to decide
how many embryos to put in,

13:02.349 --> 13:04.918
the sex of the embryos,
but it's the reality.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.053
<i>This is what couples</i>
<i>like us have to do.</i>

13:07.053 --> 13:10.323
I mean, we want to--
[squeaking]

13:10.357 --> 13:13.660
and we do,
but nothing really happens.

13:13.693 --> 13:17.697
- Well, maybe
you're destined to have a son.

13:17.731 --> 13:20.767
You've always had a dream
about having a daughter.

13:20.800 --> 13:22.135
- The only way
I can explain is I've had

13:22.168 --> 13:24.604
this vision
of having a daughter.

13:24.637 --> 13:25.839
I've had it for so long.

13:25.872 --> 13:27.173
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>where it came from.</i>

13:27.207 --> 13:28.875
Look, baby, "I love Daddy."
Exciting?

13:28.908 --> 13:30.844
- Yeah, that's very sweet.

13:30.877 --> 13:32.946
<i>- Maybe I'm selfish</i>
<i>for thinking this,</i>

13:32.979 --> 13:36.383
but I would love nothing more

13:36.416 --> 13:41.554
if we could have
a daughter together

13:41.588 --> 13:46.092
where I'm the father
genetically.

13:46.092 --> 13:47.594
- Maybe we're just
thinking too much.

13:47.627 --> 13:50.397
We're trying to control
the process too much.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.766
When life throws
something different at you,

13:52.799 --> 13:56.770
you just have to keep your mind
open to other possibilities.

13:58.872 --> 14:00.073
I think we do this.

14:00.106 --> 14:03.476
I think we put in my girl,
we put in your girl.

14:03.510 --> 14:05.412
- Two girls?
- We put in two girls.

14:05.445 --> 14:08.715
And if that doesn't work out,
then we put in two boys

14:08.748 --> 14:10.884
and then put another two boys

14:10.917 --> 14:12.252
until it does.

14:14.821 --> 14:16.790
- Maybe Mila is supposed
to be Derek's daughter.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.425
That--we're--you know,
it's gonna be our daughter

14:18.458 --> 14:20.293
but genetically Derek's,

14:20.326 --> 14:21.494
and we're gonna
bring her up together.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.629
She's still gonna be my Mila.

14:22.662 --> 14:24.164
Maybe I just got it
a little bit wrong

14:24.197 --> 14:27.267
in my heart all those years
when I was thinking of her.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.768
- As long as we have
a healthy baby,

14:28.802 --> 14:30.870
that is the goal.

14:30.904 --> 14:34.107
- How can you be so wise
and so sexy at the same time?

14:34.140 --> 14:35.809
What?

14:35.842 --> 14:37.077
I love you so much.

14:37.110 --> 14:38.311
Thank you for five years.

14:38.345 --> 14:40.080
- Thank you for five years.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.415
- Is it weird I get aroused when
I smell your whiskey breath?

to be a merlot 1962.

- He's not here.

15:07.273 --> 15:08.508
He's always late.

15:08.541 --> 15:10.410
I haven't talked to Ryan
since our last meeting,

15:10.443 --> 15:13.113
but Soly wants this penthouse
sold yesterday,

15:13.146 --> 15:15.415
<i>so I know Ryan</i>
<i>is focusing on buyers,</i>

15:15.448 --> 15:17.350

<i>there is in the city.</i>

Okay, these lights are not on.
Can you turn them on?

15:24.057 --> 15:25.058
- Sure.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.226
- Because that, to me,
is what's going

15:26.259 --> 15:27.794
to be the key
of selling this property.

15:27.827 --> 15:28.895
I think I'm good.

15:28.928 --> 15:30.063
- Okay, good.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.065
- Every corner, every angle
of this apartment

17:12.098 --> 17:13.600
faces the park.

17:13.633 --> 17:15.435
The ceilings are 10 feet
all throughout,

17:15.468 --> 17:18.171
except on the master bedroom
we were able to find 2 feet

17:18.204 --> 17:19.406
when we were doing
the construction.

17:19.439 --> 17:20.407
- Everyone likes it?
all: Yeah.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.441
- Yeah? It's crazy, right?

17:21.474 --> 17:23.076
all: Yeah!

17:23.109 --> 17:24.310
- Who thinks he should buy it?

17:24.344 --> 17:25.478
all: Yeah!

17:25.512 --> 17:26.546
- Is this a stand-up comedy,

17:26.579 --> 17:28.948
or are we actually
selling property?

17:29.049 --> 17:32.085
[fake laughs]

17:32.118 --> 17:34.120
Like, it's not funny.

17:34.154 --> 17:37.724
* *

17:37.757 --> 17:39.659
<i>- I mean, you can wake up,</i>
<i>literally, to the sun</i>

17:39.693 --> 17:41.061
rising over here in the east,

17:41.094 --> 17:43.763
and you go to sleep with the sun
setting over the west.

17:43.797 --> 17:46.299
- How much is it going for?
- 16.

17:46.332 --> 17:49.636
- Wow, that's
a really high price.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.971
- It's a little bit overpriced.
- You think this is overpriced?

17:52.072 --> 17:53.340
- Yeah, a little bit.

17:53.373 --> 17:55.775
- Across the street you're gonna
pay twice the amount.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.677
- There's nothing you can find
for this price per square foot.

17:57.711 --> 17:59.546
- That's a lot.

18:04.617 --> 18:06.386
- It's probably
the nicest master bedroom suite

18:06.419 --> 18:07.854
I've ever had
the chance to sell.

18:07.887 --> 18:09.389
- Hi.

18:09.422 --> 18:13.460
- Hi. Mwah!
- How are you?

18:13.493 --> 18:15.795
What do you think?
- Hey, good to see you.

18:15.829 --> 18:18.465
- Listen, as much
as I dislike Ryan,

18:18.498 --> 18:20.033
<i>you know,</i>
<i>I always liked Emilia.</i>

18:20.033 --> 18:21.835
I don't know her well,
but she seems

18:21.868 --> 18:23.536
like a very grounded person.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.604
How are you?
- Good.

18:24.637 --> 18:25.672
- Can I get you something
to drink?

18:25.705 --> 18:28.274
<i>She seems to be not like Ryan.</i>

18:28.308 --> 18:31.911
You know, imagine
two Ryans together.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.513
So what brings you here?

18:33.546 --> 18:37.951
- Well, I'm a little
disappointed.

18:38.051 --> 18:39.285
- In?
- You.

18:39.319 --> 18:40.787
- In me?
- Yes.

18:45.392 --> 18:46.426
<i>- Coming up...</i>

18:46.459 --> 18:47.794
It's the last unit.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.562
You have your own entrance.
- Is this almost finished?

18:49.596 --> 18:51.431
- Well, guys,
you can see the vision.

18:51.464 --> 18:53.400
- I can see dust.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.567
- The open house was awkward.

18:54.601 --> 18:56.069
Your girlfriend
coming to me and--

18:56.069 --> 18:59.072
- Is that why we're here?
Because Emilia made you upset?

19:06.479 --> 19:07.113
- There's a lot
of closet space,

19:08.281 --> 19:10.550
huge master bath,
which is awesome.

19:10.583 --> 19:12.485
- So what brings you here?

19:12.519 --> 19:16.222
- Well, I'm a little
disappointed.

19:16.256 --> 19:17.490
- In?
- You.

19:17.524 --> 19:19.292
- In me?
- Yes.

19:19.325 --> 19:21.528
I know you completely
ambushed him

19:21.561 --> 19:23.063
and insulted him the other day.

19:23.096 --> 19:24.831
- Okay, you know there's always
two versions of everything.

19:24.864 --> 19:26.666
- There's always two versions
to the story,

19:26.700 --> 19:29.202
but insulting
somebody's integrity?

19:29.235 --> 19:31.104
I think sometimes you take it
a little too far.

19:31.137 --> 19:34.474
- Did he ask you to come here?
- No, actually, he didn't.

19:34.507 --> 19:35.842
He didn't.
- Listen.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.544
I told him what I expected
from him, and I think that--

19:37.577 --> 19:38.778
- There's no part in anything

19:38.812 --> 19:39.913
that you think
that you were wrong?

19:39.946 --> 19:41.681
Nothing?
- Well, there's not--

19:41.715 --> 19:43.817
- We're talking
about your response to things.

19:43.850 --> 19:45.852
You respond to things
with a sledgehammer,

19:45.885 --> 19:47.053
and that's not--

19:47.053 --> 19:48.421
- You don't even
know my response with him,

19:48.455 --> 19:49.789
Emilia, you don't.

19:49.823 --> 19:51.624
You weren't here.
- You're missing the point.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.060
- The fact
that she knows for certain,

19:54.060 --> 19:56.730
like, she knows
as if she was there,

19:56.763 --> 19:59.699
<i>it's starting to make</i>
<i>me feel uncomfortable.</i>

19:59.733 --> 20:01.034
<i>This is unnecessary.</i>

20:01.067 --> 20:03.970
This is the day of the launching
of this penthouse.

20:04.004 --> 20:06.373
I cannot, like,
have this drama.

20:06.406 --> 20:07.674
How do I put it?

20:07.707 --> 20:09.943
I think that this is something
between me and him,

20:09.976 --> 20:13.646
but it does not concern you.

20:13.680 --> 20:16.449
- I don't want to hear
those things again, though.

20:16.483 --> 20:17.984
- I mean, come on, like...

20:18.018 --> 20:19.219
Good-bye.

20:22.255 --> 20:23.890
<i>There's a commitment</i>
<i>to my sellers,</i>

20:23.923 --> 20:25.325
but I'm questioning

20:25.358 --> 20:29.195
whether I should continue
this partnership or not,

20:29.229 --> 20:33.299
and I think I'm...leaning
towards ending it.

20:35.935 --> 20:38.905
<i>[upbeat pop music]</i>

20:38.938 --> 20:41.975
* *

20:42.008 --> 20:43.777
- Can we do lemons and limes?

20:43.810 --> 20:45.011
- We can.
- Oh, you're here.

20:45.045 --> 20:46.379
- Of course.

20:46.413 --> 20:48.581
- Okay, is everything perfect?
- Yes.

20:48.615 --> 20:50.450
- Excuse me, what's this?
- We're pouring tea.

20:50.483 --> 20:53.319
- Wait, is this--
- This is mint.

20:53.353 --> 20:54.421
- No, but this is New York
real estate.

20:54.454 --> 20:55.655
We need alcohol.
We need to sell.

20:55.689 --> 20:57.991
- This is an afternoon event.

20:58.024 --> 21:01.261
- I mean, Jordan is amazing,
but he should have known.

21:01.294 --> 21:03.163
<i>I mean, who's gonna write</i>
<i>a $10 million check</i>

21:03.196 --> 21:05.298
drinking sparkling water?

21:05.331 --> 21:06.833
Jordan.

21:06.866 --> 21:08.702
You sure you don't have any?
- Sorry.

21:08.735 --> 21:10.637
[doorbell rings]
- Welcome.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.372
The bidding war is taking place
in the kitchen.

21:12.405 --> 21:13.940
You can put in
your offer on a napkin.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.308
There's no alcohol, but--

21:15.342 --> 21:17.477
<i>I've invited lots</i>
<i>and lots of top brokers,</i>

21:17.510 --> 21:20.080
and my strategy here is to throw
the party in the penthouse

21:20.080 --> 21:22.282
<i>to show the beautiful,</i>
<i>finished environment</i>

21:22.315 --> 21:25.085
before I bring them
down to the unfinished,

21:25.118 --> 21:27.087
raw space downstairs.

21:27.087 --> 21:29.589
That way they will know exactly
what it's gonna look like.

21:32.292 --> 21:34.260
- What would you like?

21:34.294 --> 21:36.596
- You can certainly
have a Diet Coke.

21:36.629 --> 21:38.131
- Hi, guys.
Welcome.

21:38.164 --> 21:41.334
So you're standing
in an old printing house.

21:41.368 --> 21:42.836
That's why the building
has hundreds

21:42.869 --> 21:43.837
and hundreds of windows,

21:43.870 --> 21:45.138
'cause back in the days

21:45.171 --> 21:47.340
they needed to get light
to see what they were printing.

21:47.374 --> 21:51.344
Please look around and enjoy
this beautiful building.

21:53.346 --> 21:54.781
Isn't this so beautiful?

21:54.814 --> 21:56.216
- I would live here in a second.

21:56.249 --> 21:58.184
- Look at this, the black
fixtures, the Kallista.

21:58.218 --> 22:00.220
- Oh, it's luxurious.
- That's out of London.

22:00.253 --> 22:03.189
And look at the doors,
solid core.

22:03.223 --> 22:04.524
[knocks loudly]

22:04.557 --> 22:06.359
That's very solid, okay?
Mm-hmm.

22:06.393 --> 22:07.727
- It's beautiful.
I love it.

22:07.761 --> 22:09.729
- I love this ceiling.
- I love it too.

22:09.763 --> 22:12.232
There's also one unit

22:12.265 --> 22:13.733
which we call a mansion,

22:13.767 --> 22:16.169
which is a little unfinished,
but I'm gonna take a group.

22:16.202 --> 22:17.904
And it's a real good opportunity

22:17.937 --> 22:20.573
for someone who wants
<i>a lot</i>of square feet--come on.

22:20.607 --> 22:21.875
Perception,
perception, perception.

22:21.908 --> 22:23.176
It's all about perception.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.111
It has insane ceilings.

22:25.145 --> 22:27.480
You lift up--whoosh--
the good things

22:27.514 --> 22:29.683
and--mm-mm--try to hide
the negatives.

22:29.716 --> 22:31.418
It's the last unit.

22:31.451 --> 22:34.554
In Manhattan, a townhouse
is only 20, 25,

22:34.587 --> 22:36.089
maybe 30 foot wide.

22:36.089 --> 22:37.257
You can see the potential.

22:37.290 --> 22:38.925
It's an amazing space.

22:38.958 --> 22:40.360
<i>This is why we're</i>
<i>calling it a mansion,</i>

22:40.393 --> 22:41.828
50 foot wide.

22:41.861 --> 22:43.963
Welcome.

22:43.997 --> 22:46.232
Look up at the ceilings,
15-foot ceilings.

22:46.266 --> 22:47.600
So basically, you have
your own entrance.

22:47.634 --> 22:48.735
- This is almost finished?

22:48.768 --> 22:50.136
- Well, it's getting there.

22:50.170 --> 22:52.839
The windows are in, and then
behind me, you can envision

22:52.872 --> 22:53.973
if you close your eyes,

22:54.007 --> 22:56.276
you have this amazing kitchen.

22:56.309 --> 22:59.112
- These doorways are a bit
short for such high ceilings.

22:59.145 --> 23:00.447
- Everything
you see here is temporary.

23:00.480 --> 23:01.514
They're working on it.

23:01.548 --> 23:02.582
You're gonna get exactly

23:02.615 --> 23:03.650
what you got up
in the penthouse.

23:03.683 --> 23:05.118
Guys, you can see the vision.

23:05.151 --> 23:06.920
You're sharing this passion.

23:06.953 --> 23:09.656
- I can see dust.
[laughter]

23:09.689 --> 23:11.725
- I thought I didn't need
to render this apartment

23:11.758 --> 23:13.426
<i>because I had a finished</i>
<i>apartment upstairs.</i>

23:13.460 --> 23:15.061
For two minutes,
all people had to do

23:15.095 --> 23:17.130
was to--zzzt--take pictures
in their head

23:17.163 --> 23:19.599
and imagine it
in the mansion downstairs.

23:19.632 --> 23:22.235
[people coughing
and laughing]

23:22.268 --> 23:24.070
And for the first time,
almost, in my career,

23:24.070 --> 23:26.473
I almost don't want
to sell the penthouse.

23:26.506 --> 23:27.741
Then I'm stuck
with this mansion,

23:27.774 --> 23:28.942
maybe forever.

23:28.975 --> 23:30.143
They're coming back
tomorrow to finish.

23:30.176 --> 23:31.711
The kitchen needs a little work.

23:31.745 --> 23:33.780
Guys?
Guys?

23:33.813 --> 23:36.783
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

23:36.816 --> 23:40.086

23:40.086 --> 23:43.223
- The open house was a disaster,
not businesswise,

23:43.256 --> 23:44.524
because businesswise
it was good

23:44.557 --> 23:46.493
<i>because a lot of people</i>
<i>came through,</i>

23:46.526 --> 23:49.496

<i>his attitude,</i>
<i>bringing Emilia</i>

23:51.264 --> 23:54.100
<i>and trying to accuse me</i>
<i>in a professional setting.</i>

23:54.134 --> 23:59.339
You know, I have to either let
it go and just move forward

23:59.372 --> 24:01.608
or I should let him go.

24:01.641 --> 24:03.209
- I don't know,
give me till 5:30 then.

24:03.243 --> 24:04.244
I just don't have
time to do this.

24:04.277 --> 24:05.712
I got to go do
this stupid meeting.

24:05.745 --> 24:09.049
<i>The king of integrity</i>
<i>has called a meeting with me.</i>

24:09.082 --> 24:10.417
Maybe he won't be there.

24:10.450 --> 24:13.753
Maybe Ronita will be there
in his place,

24:13.787 --> 24:16.456
and I would actually
prefer that.

24:16.489 --> 24:17.590
What's going on?

24:21.294 --> 24:22.829
- All right,
I think it's very important

24:22.862 --> 24:24.531
that we have this conversation,
and the reason that we're here

24:24.564 --> 24:26.666
is because the open house
was awkward.

24:26.700 --> 24:28.501
Your girlfriend coming to me
and telling me

24:28.535 --> 24:30.070
that I insulted
your integrity was awkward.

24:30.070 --> 24:33.673
- Is that why we're here,
because Emilia made you upset?

24:33.707 --> 24:34.941
Is she too much for you?

24:34.974 --> 24:36.643
She can be too much for me.
I completely get it.

24:36.676 --> 24:39.913
- Open your f***ing head
up, man.

24:39.946 --> 24:41.748
Listen, you know what?
I'll tell you the truth.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.850
- You tell me the truth.

24:43.883 --> 24:48.722
- It's very clear that you don't
see--you only see your side,

24:48.755 --> 24:50.590
and this is not good
for the listing, okay?

24:50.623 --> 24:52.792
- So you're upset
that I didn't call you.

24:52.826 --> 24:54.561
- I'm disappointed.

24:54.594 --> 24:56.796
It wasn't right,
at least in my eyes.

24:59.299 --> 25:01.801
It wasn't right.

25:01.835 --> 25:04.137
- I--I'll man up
and be man enough

25:04.170 --> 25:06.139
and say I should
have called you,

25:06.172 --> 25:08.041
but if you were that upset,

25:08.074 --> 25:10.043
you should have picked up
the phone and been like,

25:10.043 --> 25:12.579
"Ryan, what the f***?
What's going on?

25:12.612 --> 25:14.914
What am I reading about?"
and I would have explained it.

25:14.948 --> 25:18.151
But, no, you told me
that I have no integrity,

25:18.184 --> 25:21.187
and that's totally f***ed up.

25:21.221 --> 25:22.422
<i>When I talked to Emilia,</i>
<i>she told me</i>

25:22.455 --> 25:26.092

what I'm thinking

25:32.866 --> 25:34.401
or what I'm feeling.

25:34.434 --> 25:36.069
There's 60,000 brokers
in this city.

25:36.069 --> 25:38.805
There's probably five of them
that I'd want to work with,

25:38.838 --> 25:41.675
and you were one of them
until you sat me down

25:41.708 --> 25:43.977
and told me I don't deserve
to breathe the air you breathe.

25:46.980 --> 25:49.482
No one's ever said
stuff like that to me before.

25:52.352 --> 25:53.586
- I need to tell you

25:53.620 --> 25:57.457
that I'm disappointed
by the way you acted.

25:57.490 --> 26:00.460
- I get it.

26:00.493 --> 26:03.329
- For the first time,
there's vulnerability.

26:03.363 --> 26:06.833
There's, like, realness.

26:06.866 --> 26:10.337
Listen, I just wish that
I could have enjoyed this one.

26:10.370 --> 26:13.139
- And we can.
Let's move on, right?

26:13.173 --> 26:16.910
We're both grown men, sort of.

26:16.943 --> 26:20.046
- You f***ing piece of sh**.

26:20.046 --> 26:21.047
- What are you trying
to say to me?

26:21.047 --> 26:22.949
What are you trying
to say to me?

26:23.049 --> 26:25.518
<i>- I have a lot</i>
<i>of hesitation, obviously,</i>

26:25.552 --> 26:28.488
but he's not fired.

26:28.521 --> 26:29.889
Let's move forward.

26:29.923 --> 26:32.058
- Is that straight?
- Yes.

26:32.058 --> 26:35.261
- That's why you're
so f***ing emotional.

26:35.295 --> 26:36.429
<i>- Coming up...</i>

26:36.463 --> 26:37.831
- This building's
the hottest in the city.

26:37.864 --> 26:39.265
Everyone's paid full price.
<i>- It's true.</i>

26:39.299 --> 26:41.067
<i>Everything else sold</i>
<i>at full ask,</i>

26:41.101 --> 26:42.268
but it's a record
for the building.

26:42.302 --> 26:43.970
- I'm not doing it.

26:51.678 --> 26:52.679
- Let's make it fun,
you know, professional but fun.

26:53.947 --> 26:56.182
- Yeah, after you.
- Thank you.

26:56.216 --> 26:58.985
- Ladies first.
- [laughs]

26:59.085 --> 27:01.121
Listen, it's not like Ryan

27:01.154 --> 27:03.456
<i>but we did make some progress</i>
<i>the other night.</i>

27:03.490 --> 27:04.891
- I got it.

27:04.924 --> 27:07.093
- And I think it couldn't
have come at a better time.

27:07.127 --> 27:08.561
All right, so place
is looking beautiful.

27:08.595 --> 27:10.630
<i>This is the first listing</i>
<i>that Soly has given to me,</i>

27:10.663 --> 27:13.033
and I want to sell it
because I want him to know

27:13.033 --> 27:14.200
that it was a great idea

27:14.234 --> 27:16.169
to hire me
even though I'm his friend.

27:16.202 --> 27:17.537
Too bad it's not sunny though.

27:17.570 --> 27:18.838
- I think it looks great.

27:18.872 --> 27:22.442
Unfortunately, with the price
being pretty high,

27:22.475 --> 27:25.512
no one made offers
after our open house,

27:25.545 --> 27:30.216
so our strategy is going
to be to let everybody know

27:30.250 --> 27:31.718
about this listing.

27:31.751 --> 27:32.719
- Hello.
- Hey.

27:32.752 --> 27:33.787
- Nice to meet you.

27:33.820 --> 27:35.855
- Nice to meet you.
- How are you?

27:35.889 --> 27:37.090
- Hello, how are you?
- Welcome.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.358

27:45.365 --> 27:46.466

27:46.499 --> 27:48.702
- Both you guys
are selling this apartment?

27:48.735 --> 27:51.738
- Yes. This show
is about the high-end market.

27:51.771 --> 27:54.207
<i>The potential buyers</i>
<i>for this penthouse</i>

27:54.240 --> 27:55.875
are most likely found

27:55.909 --> 27:58.144
in the audience
of this network and this show.

27:58.178 --> 27:59.312
- Got it?

27:59.346 --> 28:00.580
Mark.

28:00.613 --> 28:03.450
- So we're on Billionaire's Row,
57th Street.

28:03.483 --> 28:05.018
Why is this street

28:05.051 --> 28:07.320
one of the most expensive
streets in the world?

28:07.354 --> 28:09.689
- Uh--
- Proximity to Central Park,

28:09.723 --> 28:11.157
and it's Midtown.

28:11.191 --> 28:14.761
57th Street is that main artery
that runs through Manhattan.

28:14.794 --> 28:16.863
- There is a lot of inventory.

28:16.896 --> 28:20.300
- Yes, you have 111 West 57th,
220 Central Park South.

28:20.333 --> 28:22.669
- It's all more expensive.

28:22.702 --> 28:24.070
<i>- I see what you're doing.</i>

28:24.104 --> 28:27.073
I know you want to be an actor,
but this is not the time, okay?

28:27.107 --> 28:29.342
I got some lines too, okay?
- It's crazy.

28:29.376 --> 28:30.877
I mean, you go upstairs,
it's all over the place.

28:30.910 --> 28:32.278
- I think that the seller

28:32.312 --> 28:34.381
of this apartment
was extremely smart.

28:34.414 --> 28:37.050
He turned it around.
- He gutted it.

28:37.050 --> 28:38.618
But nothing can replace
Metropolitan Tower.

28:38.651 --> 28:40.887
- If you were
to search today--I just

28:40.920 --> 28:42.288
wanted to make
a statement on this.

28:42.322 --> 28:44.190
If you were to search
today of properties

28:44.224 --> 28:46.593
up to $15 million,
this is the top.

28:46.626 --> 28:48.361
Oh, but I know
you want the last word.

28:48.395 --> 28:49.796
I'm just gonna keep talking.

28:49.829 --> 28:51.698
Eh, would you like
to make us an offer?

I'm trying to lose weight.

29:03.243 --> 29:04.811
Thank you, though.
That's very thoughtful.

29:04.844 --> 29:06.713
- Why do you need to lose
weight? You look so good.

29:06.746 --> 29:08.081
- Well, you know,
you can always look better.

29:08.114 --> 29:10.116
- You don't want to be,
like, a twink.

29:10.150 --> 29:11.818
- What's a twink, Fredrik?

29:11.851 --> 29:15.655
- Like, if you got really
skinny, like, really thin.

29:15.689 --> 29:17.457

- You'd be, like, twinkish.

29:17.490 --> 29:18.792
You want to be like, mmm!

- Well, I think you have
to be young...er.

29:22.562 --> 29:25.165
- So you know what a twink is.

29:25.198 --> 29:27.667
- Anyway, keep going.

- Nice suit.

30:23.957 --> 30:28.595

some extra persuasion.

really good news.

Never, ever, ever
negotiate over email.

It just takes, like,
20 minutes to get to SoHo.

30:38.104 --> 30:41.341
A $250 lunch can translate
into the developer

30:49.649 --> 30:53.453

your penthouse, 9 million.

30:57.323 --> 30:59.292
- Why are you so excited
at 9 million?

30:59.325 --> 31:00.794
- Because we're asking 9 1/4

31:00.827 --> 31:02.729
because nine is a record
because the ask was high.

31:02.762 --> 31:03.930
We knew it was high,
I mean.

31:03.963 --> 31:07.767
But nine is just incredible.

31:07.801 --> 31:09.069
- I don't buy that.

31:09.069 --> 31:11.071
This building is the hottest

This is--at 9 million,
it's over 3,000 a foot.

It's a record for the building
and also for the neighborhood.

31:24.184 --> 31:26.086
- 9.250.

31:26.086 --> 31:29.089
I don't have to say any more.

detail I need to tell you,

31:31.858 --> 31:35.328
and that is all cash, bam.

31:35.362 --> 31:37.097
See? Now?
Now? Nine?

31:37.097 --> 31:38.264
Mm-hmm?

31:38.298 --> 31:40.100
- All cash?

31:40.100 --> 31:41.801
- Yes, that's what I said,
all cash.

31:44.804 --> 31:45.972
- Maybe.

31:46.006 --> 31:49.876
- Like, in a negotiation
it's key to delay

31:49.909 --> 31:52.946
certain pieces
of important information.

31:52.979 --> 31:54.481
- You sure about the all cash?

31:54.514 --> 31:55.949
- Yes.
I have it in writing.

31:55.982 --> 31:58.351

and they're like, "Mm-hmm,"

Remember, you told me that
you needed that unit finished

32:13.233 --> 32:14.567

Oh, no.

I mean, I thought
we had an understanding.

34:45.151 --> 34:46.653
This is--

34:46.686 --> 34:49.322
This looks worse
than it did before.

Anybody home?
Is anybody working?

34:52.092 --> 34:53.626

You are?

35:10.043 --> 35:11.644
- Roy.

35:11.678 --> 35:15.081
- Roy. Um, so I need
a bit of help.

35:15.115 --> 35:16.449
You see, I have
a very important client.

35:16.483 --> 35:18.585
He's flying in from Singapore,

35:18.618 --> 35:20.387
and I need
this to be presentable.

35:20.420 --> 35:21.888
I thought it was gonna
be cleaned up by now.

35:21.921 --> 35:23.890
Could you walkie-talkie
everyone?

35:23.923 --> 35:26.926
We can do it.
We can clean it out.

35:26.960 --> 35:31.064
- Ain't no chance
of them coming in here now.

35:31.097 --> 35:32.632
- Now I'm gonna
have to reschedule everything

35:32.665 --> 35:34.401

I mean, nothing has been done,
and I'm freaking out.

35:56.322 --> 35:57.590
- I can't believe this.

35:57.624 --> 36:00.727
My one opportunity--this was
my one chance,

36:00.760 --> 36:02.262

- Oops! Sorry.

Talk to me.

Yes! Finally we have an offer
to bring to Soly.

37:14.034 --> 37:16.036
<i>It's not the highest,</i>

37:16.069 --> 37:17.437

is always great.

37:17.470 --> 37:19.072
The offer's 11 million.

37:22.709 --> 37:25.345
- Obviously the price
is way off.

37:25.378 --> 37:26.746
I'm not impressed
with the offer.

37:26.780 --> 37:29.416

37:29.449 --> 37:33.186
but no one agrees with him
on what his apartment is worth.

37:33.219 --> 37:35.155
- I'm thinking 16 million.

37:35.188 --> 37:36.356
- It's way too expensive.

37:36.389 --> 37:38.224
- Maybe around the 10-12 range.

37:38.258 --> 37:41.594
- About 9.6.

37:41.628 --> 37:43.296
- Who's the buyer?
- She's a mother.

37:43.329 --> 37:44.964
She has kids in San Francisco,

37:45.065 --> 37:47.867

She's paying all cash.

from a private showing

37:54.374 --> 37:56.543
I did,
just for the record.

37:56.576 --> 37:58.812
I know we're completely far
apart from our asking price,

37:58.845 --> 37:59.913
but at least it's an offer.

38:00.013 --> 38:01.114
- It's a lowball.

38:01.147 --> 38:02.482
They're trying to steal it,

38:02.515 --> 38:03.917
and this is
the Metropolitan Building.

38:04.017 --> 38:06.019
It was, at one point,
one of the best buildings

38:06.019 --> 38:07.554

38:07.587 --> 38:09.356
- At one point.

38:09.389 --> 38:11.024
The building's old.

we have a relationship,

38:23.770 --> 38:25.238
I don't think
that we're priced to sell.

so many times,

38:28.041 --> 38:29.676

that we have,

have to reel them in.

This is forward momentum.
It's good progress.

38:38.385 --> 38:41.121

giving her a counter.

38:41.154 --> 38:42.389
- Okay.

38:42.422 --> 38:45.892
- I think
we could do 15 million.

38:45.925 --> 38:48.294
- I think we'll
lose them at that.

38:48.328 --> 38:49.896
- Make it happen, Luis.

38:55.135 --> 38:57.337
- Emma, Luis here.
How are you?

38:57.370 --> 38:58.872
They are ready to make a deal,

38:58.905 --> 39:01.074
so they have come down
a million dollars,

39:01.107 --> 39:04.144

and now they're at 15 million.

39:04.177 --> 39:06.513

- Regardless of how old
the building is,

for the same square footage
and the same views,

39:11.184 --> 39:13.153

at least 40 million.

39:21.428 --> 39:22.462

39:22.495 --> 39:23.763
- Spring is good.

39:23.797 --> 39:26.266
I mean, we're just only
just now getting started,

39:26.299 --> 39:27.901
and I don't want to start
bringing people through

- So it's telling
you something.

39:48.088 --> 39:49.556
That's what people

39:49.589 --> 39:50.857
- Something is bothering me.

We have done more
than any other broker

40:33.466 --> 40:35.368
could have done,
and I stand by that.

40:35.402 --> 40:37.604

40:37.637 --> 40:39.839

40:39.873 --> 40:41.675

Now we're just sitting holding
our dicks in our hand waiting

40:44.444 --> 40:46.446

with the right number.

We are not the problem.

Absolutely, but at the same time
I don't want to waste time

41:37.697 --> 41:39.099
I apologize.
- Whoa, what are you--

41:39.099 --> 41:40.967

41:41.001 --> 41:42.535

gone to market though.

41:42.569 --> 41:44.337

- No, no, no, no, no.

41:44.371 --> 41:45.905
- I'm sorry about that.

41:45.939 --> 41:48.008
- Met Tower has nothing to do
with Spring Street.

41:48.108 --> 41:50.377
You cannot mix them. They are
two totally different things.

41:50.410 --> 41:51.611
- I understand.

41:51.644 --> 41:52.879
- You got to at least let me put
it on the market

41:52.912 --> 41:54.247

41:54.280 --> 41:56.416

I'm just not feeling the energy.

41:57.717 --> 41:59.519
- I need new faces,
new energy.

41:59.552 --> 42:01.855
We have to terminate.
We have to move on.

42:01.888 --> 42:03.857

- Only time will tell.

42:07.327 --> 42:09.763
Have a good one.

42:15.402 --> 42:16.903

you brought me in there.
