00:16.476 --> 00:17.609
Private beach!

00:17.646 --> 00:19.475
All good... I'll stay
on the other side of the reef.

01:19.915 --> 01:20.992
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

01:21.029 --> 01:23.844
<i>we are in our final
descent to Nimitz Bay,</i>

01:23.881 --> 01:25.620
<i>the crown jewel of Reef Island.</i>

01:25.984 --> 01:28.990
<i>Local time is 10:50 a.m.</i>

01:29.429 --> 01:31.320
<i>It's a beautiful day at the reef.</i>

01:31.507 --> 01:33.160
<i>Light breeze coming out of the east.</i>

01:33.265 --> 01:36.485
<i>Top temperature is around 84 degrees.</i>

01:37.046 --> 01:40.052
<i>As you know, Reef Island is a U.S.
territory,</i>

01:40.098 --> 01:41.990
<i>and all U.S. citizens,</i>

01:42.027 --> 01:43.577
<i>please make sure you have filled out</i>

01:43.614 --> 01:46.752
<i>your Customs declaration
forms before you deplane.</i>

01:47.317 --> 01:50.306
<i>Flight crew, prepare for landing.</i>

02:06.248 --> 02:08.073
Thank you for
flying Reef Island Airways.

02:08.126 --> 02:09.223
Thank you.

02:11.449 --> 02:13.521
Air Marshal, am I right?

02:14.068 --> 02:15.977
You're the only one on the plane
wearing a jacket.

02:16.014 --> 02:17.910
You didn't get up
from your seat not even once

02:17.947 --> 02:19.866
during the whole flight,
not even to pee.

02:19.995 --> 02:22.972
And you've got that Beretta-sized
tumor on your right hip.

02:23.009 --> 02:25.362
Plus, you kind of look like
a man of the law.

02:25.501 --> 02:28.750
So, how is it you didn't notice
that guy right behind you in 4B?

02:28.861 --> 02:30.385
He was the first one off the plane,

02:30.432 --> 02:32.280
got up to check his bag,
like, seven times.

02:32.331 --> 02:33.924
Plus, he had a gun in his boot

02:33.961 --> 02:36.630
that they missed
in Los Angeles <i> and</i> Honolulu

02:36.667 --> 02:38.184
and a wound on his left side

02:38.221 --> 02:40.160
that is starting to seep
through his shirt.

02:40.263 --> 02:42.776
So, I'm thinking maybe armed robbery?

02:42.813 --> 02:44.562
Why the hell didn't you say something?

02:44.599 --> 02:47.178
Uh, well, I didn't want to get
stuck inside a 12-foot-wide tube

02:47.281 --> 02:49.280
during midflight... crossfire?

03:00.443 --> 03:01.902
Everybody! Get down!

03:04.461 --> 03:05.830
Stop, man!

03:19.240 --> 03:20.417
Hm?

03:30.107 --> 03:31.257
Stay down!

03:57.715 --> 03:59.215
Keep the change.

04:06.075 --> 04:07.234
Help with your bags?

04:07.301 --> 04:08.610
Jimmy.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.272
- Hey. Cat.
- Hey!

04:10.332 --> 04:11.879
- Welcome home.
- Yeah, well,

04:11.916 --> 04:13.574
this isn't home. Not anymore.

04:13.611 --> 04:14.950
You saying you didn't miss us?

04:15.035 --> 04:16.764
Oh, come on, Jimmy.
You know I love you guys.

04:16.801 --> 04:18.730
I just, uh, you know...

04:19.065 --> 04:20.161
Well, it's complicated.

04:20.199 --> 04:21.865
Hey, hey, I thought
you were doing more time.

04:21.902 --> 04:23.110
When did you get out?

04:23.228 --> 04:24.397
About a year ago.

04:24.434 --> 04:27.006
Wow. You got a job, you got a suit.

04:27.043 --> 04:28.240
You look good.

04:28.277 --> 04:29.655
You here for Doug's parole hearing?

04:29.692 --> 04:31.901
Uh, yeah. I thought I'd drop by.

04:31.991 --> 04:33.793
Seems like you couldn't
stay away forever.

04:35.849 --> 04:37.354
You take care.

05:15.682 --> 05:16.891
Hey, what can I get you?

05:16.928 --> 05:18.610
Scotch rocks, Kiko.

05:19.045 --> 05:20.610
Can I get you another?

05:20.975 --> 05:23.030
Sure.

05:23.291 --> 05:24.842
Two.

05:25.927 --> 05:27.737
I'm gonna guess...

05:28.881 --> 05:30.986
- vacation?
- Business.

05:31.244 --> 05:32.333
How long you here for?

05:32.389 --> 05:34.325
Why? 'Cause you can show me around?

05:34.748 --> 05:35.827
Let me guess.

05:35.913 --> 05:38.700
You just got that shiny gold badge.

05:38.819 --> 05:41.610
Congratulations. You're a detective.

05:41.702 --> 05:43.563
And tonight, you're thinking
you'll pick up

05:43.600 --> 05:46.022
the next shiny thing
that catches your eye.

05:46.327 --> 05:47.747
Okay.

05:50.218 --> 05:51.387
You're not interested.

05:51.616 --> 05:53.908
Oh, now, is <i> that</i> what I said?

05:54.518 --> 05:55.936
Well, you're not making it easy.

05:56.031 --> 05:58.610
Oh, you're a good-looking guy.
I bet most things come easy.

05:58.889 --> 06:01.631
And you're the hot local detective,

06:01.739 --> 06:03.444
and I'm supposed to figure

06:03.530 --> 06:05.450
you're safe for a one-night stand.

06:05.924 --> 06:08.700
That's why you're cruising
a hotel bar in the first place.

06:08.920 --> 06:10.821
Can we just rewind to
the "good-looking guy" part?

06:10.858 --> 06:12.450
Yeah.

06:21.531 --> 06:23.110
I'll bet you like to be on top.

06:23.193 --> 06:24.577
We don't have to start there,

06:24.614 --> 06:25.674
but it's usually where I end up.

06:39.342 --> 06:41.116
<i>The Reef Island Police Department</i>

06:41.161 --> 06:43.469
<i>have yet to obtain evidence
that the young woman</i>

06:43.506 --> 06:45.235
<i>had succumbed to any foul play.</i>

06:45.272 --> 06:47.048
<i>In a statement, the RPD said...</i>

06:47.085 --> 06:48.641
- Morning.
- <i>accidental drowning</i>

06:48.678 --> 06:50.450
- <i>is one of their lines of inquiry.</i>
- Hey.

06:50.654 --> 06:52.983
<i>While the search
for Tori Eastland continues,</i>

06:53.069 --> 06:54.984
<i>a spokesperson for her father,</i>

06:55.021 --> 06:58.296
<i>Eastland Empire CEO Carter Eastland,</i>

06:58.333 --> 06:59.984
<i>said that the family remains hopeful</i>

07:00.021 --> 07:01.483
- <i>that she will be found.</i>
- Wow.

07:01.520 --> 07:03.224
Tori Eastland.

07:03.295 --> 07:05.556
Richest family on the island.

07:06.160 --> 07:07.806
Hasn't brought her back yet.

07:08.467 --> 07:10.216
<i>kept prying eyes at bay.</i>

07:10.361 --> 07:12.099
- What?
- You remind me of someone.

07:12.174 --> 07:14.280
Can't quite figure out who.

07:14.433 --> 07:16.926
Well, it's a good thing you
didn't use <i> that</i> line last night.

07:16.991 --> 07:18.805
Yeah, seriously.

07:19.637 --> 07:22.530
Well, Reef and I have history.

07:22.811 --> 07:25.820
But I haven't been here
in about... five years.

07:27.692 --> 07:29.404
So, there's an offshore
hitting the North Reef.

07:29.441 --> 07:32.397
I'm gonna scrounge up a
surfboard and get in a few sets.

07:32.434 --> 07:34.568
You know, I was born here,
lived most of my life here.

07:34.605 --> 07:37.567
Just never saw the appeal of surfing.

07:37.714 --> 07:39.141
So...

07:40.010 --> 07:41.228
Later?

07:42.688 --> 07:44.977
A-Actually, later, uh, I got stuff.

07:45.124 --> 07:46.607
Later after your stuff?

07:46.644 --> 07:49.423
Well, after my stuff,
I'm gonna surf some more,

07:49.460 --> 07:51.371
- and then catch a flight out.
- Whoa.

07:54.110 --> 07:55.160
It was fun, though.

07:57.614 --> 07:59.570
Yeah, it... was fun.

08:00.142 --> 08:01.895
- See ya.
- Bye.

08:07.568 --> 08:10.900
Remorse? That's just
a word to most people.

08:11.388 --> 08:13.950
That they demand from someone else.

08:14.388 --> 08:15.999
But for the last five years,

08:16.036 --> 08:18.419
remorse has been the air
that I breathe.

08:18.540 --> 08:21.929
I accept responsibility
for every deed, every crime,

08:21.966 --> 08:23.474
everything I've ever done.

08:23.653 --> 08:25.466
I ask this parole board for the chance

08:25.503 --> 08:27.107
to live a quiet and peaceful life

08:27.144 --> 08:28.666
among my fellow citizens.

08:28.724 --> 08:29.974
Thank you.

08:32.177 --> 08:34.232
Miss Chambers, we understand

08:34.269 --> 08:35.833
that you would also like an opportunity

08:35.871 --> 08:36.945
to address this Board?

08:37.130 --> 08:38.211
Oh, you bet.

08:38.248 --> 08:41.385
See, this, uh,
remorseful soul over here?

08:41.491 --> 08:44.163
He ordered members
of the Shorepound Syndicate

08:44.200 --> 08:45.727
to murder me

08:45.825 --> 08:47.709
<i>and</i> FBI agent Jake Elliott,

08:47.746 --> 08:50.675
who still bears the scars
of that attack to this day.

08:50.712 --> 08:54.171
Uh, Miss Chambers,
before you turned informant...

08:54.208 --> 08:55.398
Informants get paid.

08:55.435 --> 08:58.781
I accidentally married
an undercover FBI agent.

08:58.818 --> 09:01.554
You used your profile
as a professional surfer

09:01.591 --> 09:03.843
to smuggle drugs, launder money,

09:03.880 --> 09:06.218
and steal jewelry and cash
from hotel rooms.

09:06.255 --> 09:08.753
I was accused, never convicted.

09:08.790 --> 09:11.653
Mnh, because you cut a deal,
predicated on cooperation...

09:11.700 --> 09:13.171
I am not a rat.

09:13.208 --> 09:14.640
I only testified

09:14.677 --> 09:17.091
after Doug O'Casey
tried to have me killed.

09:17.128 --> 09:19.732
If I did not cut a deal,
I would have been dead.

09:19.769 --> 09:21.524
Listen to me... I dragged my ass

09:21.561 --> 09:25.315
13 hours across the Pacific
to state the obvious.

09:25.352 --> 09:28.481
The idea that you would
let this man out

09:28.518 --> 09:29.826
because he went, what, a few years

09:29.863 --> 09:32.928
without shanking anybody is insane

09:32.968 --> 09:35.717
and only reminds me that the Reef

09:35.754 --> 09:38.467
is still the shadiest
sunny place in the country.

09:42.628 --> 09:43.678
Hey, Cat!

09:43.740 --> 09:45.531
Emma Hahn, KFZA online.

09:45.594 --> 09:47.794
Hey, Emma. Still working
the courtroom beat?

09:47.838 --> 09:49.681
Uh, how's it feel being back home?

09:49.718 --> 09:51.607
Okay, is this really news?

09:51.644 --> 09:53.044
Shouldn't you be covering
the kidnapping

09:53.080 --> 09:54.758
of that rich girl in the kayak?

09:54.968 --> 09:56.397
- Tori Eastland?
- Yeah.

09:56.434 --> 09:57.920
Who told you she was kidnapped?

09:57.957 --> 10:00.388
Police said maybe accidental drowning.

10:00.747 --> 10:02.099
Well, they're wrong.

10:02.362 --> 10:05.109
Black Moon Beach is 6 feet deep
out to Stevens Point.

10:05.146 --> 10:06.927
If she drowned, they would've
found her body by now.

10:06.964 --> 10:09.373
Police haven't given
any indication of a kidnapping.

10:09.966 --> 10:11.373
Huh. Well...

10:11.410 --> 10:12.127
I'm probably wrong.

10:12.193 --> 10:13.729
What do I know? I'm just a surfer.

10:46.678 --> 10:48.337
Hey, get off my wave!

10:48.454 --> 10:49.664
Aah!

10:50.890 --> 10:51.970
Oh!

10:55.158 --> 10:56.288
Oh!

10:57.628 --> 10:59.127
Aah!

11:07.018 --> 11:10.017
Hey! If you're gonna cut me off,
at least finish the wave!

11:11.189 --> 11:12.739
Petra?

11:13.628 --> 11:16.793
I haven't seen you
since you were like... 10.

11:34.106 --> 11:35.848
<i>Okay. Is this really news?</i>

11:35.885 --> 11:37.518
<i>Shouldn't you be covering
the kidnapping</i>

11:37.564 --> 11:39.125
<i>of that rich girl in the kayak?</i>

11:39.702 --> 11:41.923
<i>Tori Eastland? Who told you
she was kidnapped?</i>

11:41.975 --> 11:43.545
<i>Police said maybe accidental drowning.</i>

11:43.582 --> 11:44.870
<i>Well, they're wrong.</i>

11:44.972 --> 11:47.301
<i>Black Moon Beach is 6 feet deep
out to Stevens Point.</i>

11:47.338 --> 11:49.751
<i>If she drowned, they would've
found her body by now.</i>

11:50.092 --> 11:52.971
<i>More importantly, there's no
surf south of Martyr's Inlet.</i>

11:53.008 --> 11:55.046
<i>Well, you know, maybe
I'm wrong. What do I know?</i>

12:11.013 --> 12:12.673
Thought I recognized you.

12:14.933 --> 12:17.491
Well, I'm not sure how.

12:17.628 --> 12:20.127
No endorsements,
never cracked the Top 44...

12:20.200 --> 12:22.177
Yeah, but I do know my mug shots.

12:22.732 --> 12:24.943
Yeah, I was accused, never convicted.

12:25.021 --> 12:26.797
Just get dressed and get in the car.

12:27.639 --> 12:29.200
Why? Where are we going?

12:33.370 --> 12:34.658
Nowhere.

12:34.807 --> 12:36.217
No, that is unacceptable.

12:36.861 --> 12:38.548
Yeah, I got to go.

12:38.628 --> 12:41.167
Cat Chambers. Carter Eastland.

12:41.270 --> 12:42.381
Thank you for coming.

12:42.418 --> 12:44.377
I didn't really feel like
I had a choice.

12:44.468 --> 12:46.370
This is Ana,
from the Governor's office.

12:46.468 --> 12:48.228
<i>Lieutenant</i> Governor Dumont.

12:48.306 --> 12:49.967
Oh. Hi.

12:50.106 --> 12:52.417
I'm really sorry
to hear about your daughter.

12:52.487 --> 12:54.669
Is that why you made
a very public statement

12:54.706 --> 12:56.335
about Tori's disappearance?

12:56.469 --> 12:58.274
Oh. No, that was just...

12:58.311 --> 13:00.251
An hour after she posted
your interview,

13:00.288 --> 13:02.157
every local news channel picked it up.

13:02.298 --> 13:06.592
And then <i> this</i> showed up in
Eastland Empire's public inbox.

13:06.717 --> 13:08.834
<i>They want $6 million</i>

13:08.871 --> 13:10.996
<i>to be delivered by Cat Chambers.</i>

13:11.189 --> 13:13.217
- What?
- <i>Instructions to follow.</i>

13:16.788 --> 13:20.314
Okay, I... I had
<i>nothing</i> to do with this.

13:20.351 --> 13:22.165
I just arrived on the island,

13:22.202 --> 13:24.413
and... and, in fact, Detective, um...

13:24.541 --> 13:26.251
Detective...

13:27.181 --> 13:28.510
Cole.

13:28.678 --> 13:30.236
Right, Detective Cole here

13:30.273 --> 13:31.930
can account for some of my time.

13:31.976 --> 13:34.640
And the parole board can vouch
for most of the rest.

13:34.677 --> 13:36.300
We're not accusing you of anything.

13:36.363 --> 13:38.811
I'll pay you $50,000
to deliver the ransom.

13:38.931 --> 13:42.528
I'll give you another $100,000
when Tori comes home safely.

13:44.327 --> 13:47.278
Wow, that's a very generous offer.

13:47.315 --> 13:48.434
Um...

13:48.524 --> 13:51.978
I'm sorry, does it not strike
anyone here as a little bit odd

13:52.015 --> 13:54.672
that these kidnappers
picked my face off of TV

13:54.709 --> 13:56.393
to be a ransom courier?

13:56.511 --> 13:58.510
Not when the courier used to run
with the nastiest gang

13:58.568 --> 14:00.655
of smugglers, thieves, and
killers in the South Pacific.

14:00.692 --> 14:02.256
We were never kidnappers.

14:02.351 --> 14:05.115
Following their instructions
optimizes my chances

14:05.152 --> 14:07.777
of getting my daughter home safe.

14:07.920 --> 14:09.510
Will you do it?

14:09.978 --> 14:12.050
Will you bring my girl home to me?

14:15.683 --> 14:16.853
Yeah.

14:16.917 --> 14:18.760
I mean, I'll try.

14:19.042 --> 14:20.468
I will.

14:21.851 --> 14:24.847
Wyatt will be your liaison
to the Governor's office.

14:31.167 --> 14:33.100
So, "Wyatt," huh?

14:33.286 --> 14:35.171
Interesting... you're on
a first-name basis

14:35.208 --> 14:37.129
with the Lieutenant Governor
on the Reef?

14:37.166 --> 14:39.614
Yeah. People here know
each other's names.

14:39.699 --> 14:40.951
Seems to me like you and her

14:40.988 --> 14:42.554
might have a little bit of history.

14:42.614 --> 14:44.234
If I had any juice
with the Governor's office,

14:44.271 --> 14:46.060
we wouldn't be trusting a jailbird

14:46.097 --> 14:47.325
looking for the money angle.

14:47.391 --> 14:48.734
I'm not a jailbird.

14:48.771 --> 14:50.343
Listen, I have an idea.

14:50.380 --> 14:52.921
How about I help you find Tori

14:52.958 --> 14:54.499
before we have to make the ransom drop?

14:54.536 --> 14:55.835
That way, we skip the whole

14:55.872 --> 14:58.396
"me getting stuck between the
bad guys and the cops" thing.

14:58.442 --> 15:00.220
You have no inside information.

15:00.321 --> 15:02.560
Look, I surfed the Reef for 12 years.

15:02.661 --> 15:06.394
I can find a surfer kid who
distracted a bodyguard, okay?

15:06.492 --> 15:08.492
Kid must've known exactly
where the security cameras were.

15:08.528 --> 15:10.007
There's not a single
clean shot of his face.

15:10.044 --> 15:11.430
Well, it's the best lead we've got.

15:11.467 --> 15:12.517
There is no "us."

15:12.575 --> 15:13.720
There is <i> me </i> working the case,

15:13.757 --> 15:15.314
there is <i> you</i> going back
to your hotel room...

15:15.351 --> 15:18.138
that I'm sure the parole board
is vastly overpaying for...

15:18.228 --> 15:20.438
and waiting for my call!

15:23.060 --> 15:24.641
You know, Wyatt...

15:26.348 --> 15:28.694
I don't really see us hooking up again.

15:28.851 --> 15:30.850
Mm-hmm.

15:54.967 --> 15:58.246
Hey, Kitty Cat.

15:58.402 --> 15:59.683
Hey.

16:01.386 --> 16:03.050
Come on up.

16:14.511 --> 16:16.164
I, uh...

16:16.299 --> 16:18.928
I looked for you at
Doug O'Casey's parole hearing.

16:19.417 --> 16:22.001
Doesn't the FBI expect you
to show up for stuff like that?

16:22.038 --> 16:24.248
The Bureau doesn't expect <i> anything.</i>

16:25.368 --> 16:26.867
The only reason I wasn't sent home

16:26.904 --> 16:28.363
in the last round of budget cuts was

16:28.400 --> 16:31.251
they realized they'd have to
put me someplace else.

16:31.933 --> 16:33.029
I need your help.

16:33.101 --> 16:35.771
Whoa! The last time
you said that, killed my career.

16:35.808 --> 16:37.974
Uh, no, marrying me
while you were undercover

16:38.011 --> 16:39.099
killed your career.

16:39.136 --> 16:41.207
Memory serves, you let me in
on that little secret

16:41.244 --> 16:43.129
about day 3 of our honeymoon,

16:43.166 --> 16:44.224
after I'd already admitted

16:44.261 --> 16:47.052
to about a half dozen felonies.

16:48.891 --> 16:50.390
I was a bastard, wasn't I?

16:52.365 --> 16:55.372
So, there are these kidnappers,

16:55.409 --> 16:58.921
and, uh, they like my face
for a ransom drop.

16:58.958 --> 17:00.920
- Eastland thing?
- Yep.

17:01.101 --> 17:03.409
And then there's
this detective... Wyatt Cole.

17:03.446 --> 17:05.442
- Cole.
- You know him?

17:06.101 --> 17:09.010
Oh, as far as I know, he's okay. Um...

17:09.288 --> 17:11.959
Eastland hasn't bought him... yet.

17:12.315 --> 17:14.473
Jake, you're the only
FBI agent on this island,

17:14.510 --> 17:15.497
and you're good.

17:15.534 --> 17:17.518
How are you not involved in this case?

17:17.604 --> 17:20.702
"Not involved" is exactly
how the Bureau wants me.

17:21.190 --> 17:23.401
It strikes me
as a little screwy, though...

17:23.621 --> 17:25.106
picking you off a screen.

17:25.143 --> 17:26.428
Me too.

17:26.637 --> 17:28.676
Maybe the doers are ex-Shorepound,

17:28.713 --> 17:30.672
figure they'll get a bit of payback.

17:30.728 --> 17:32.645
This is why I need you
watching my back.

17:32.682 --> 17:34.292
- No.
- Come on, Jake!

17:34.329 --> 17:35.642
- No.
- We're good together!

17:35.643 --> 17:37.841
- No.
- There's a big payoff at the end.

17:37.878 --> 17:39.127
Oh, of course there is.

17:39.164 --> 17:40.793
Alright, fine. I'm a mercenary, okay?

17:40.830 --> 17:43.528
But there's still a girl
who's out there, kidnapped,

17:43.565 --> 17:44.997
and the "okay" detective,

17:45.034 --> 17:48.703
he won't even let me see
the surveillance tape.

17:52.519 --> 17:53.771
What I heard was,

17:53.808 --> 17:55.777
the old man fired the
bodyguard for screwing up.

17:55.814 --> 17:57.795
The guy got on a plane to San Francisco

17:57.832 --> 17:59.171
before RPD could find him

17:59.208 --> 18:00.577
and having him go through
some mug shots.

18:00.614 --> 18:01.814
And...

18:02.564 --> 18:05.979
Alright, call it just a detached
professional curiosity.

18:06.016 --> 18:07.960
"Detached."

18:08.403 --> 18:10.856
Alright, this board
is a Paulownia 6'1 Walrus

18:10.893 --> 18:12.637
with basswood stringers.

18:14.867 --> 18:16.236
That's one like Otter makes.

18:16.273 --> 18:18.458
Is he still camping out
at that junkyard?

18:18.495 --> 18:20.677
Oh, because you're gonna
go down there alone,

18:20.714 --> 18:22.200
asking questions?

18:26.353 --> 18:28.223
Sign these first.

18:28.933 --> 18:31.072
They just missed you
at Bondi Beach last July,

18:31.183 --> 18:33.192
and you haven't been in one
place more than a month since.

18:33.229 --> 18:34.768
Tell me about it.

18:38.853 --> 18:40.598
Divorce papers?

18:41.679 --> 18:43.413
One of us had to get off their ass,

18:43.450 --> 18:44.853
make it official.

18:47.429 --> 18:50.028
You mind if I have someone
take a look at these?

18:53.179 --> 18:54.570
Sure.

18:56.985 --> 18:58.825
You sure you don't want
to come with me to Otter's?

18:58.862 --> 19:00.856
You know, for old times' sake.
It'll be fun.

19:00.973 --> 19:02.146
Ha.

19:04.643 --> 19:06.786
It was only ever fun for you,

19:06.823 --> 19:08.428
wasn't it, Kitty Cat?

19:09.063 --> 19:11.919
Hey, you got a car
I can borrow for a while?

19:15.978 --> 19:17.687
You always could read my mind, Jake.

19:21.938 --> 19:23.347
Okay.

19:38.229 --> 19:39.309
Otter!

19:41.074 --> 19:43.074
We're closed! Get out!

19:44.539 --> 19:46.199
Cat?

19:47.514 --> 19:49.769
Fight or eat?

19:50.350 --> 19:52.010
Depends on the sandwich.

19:52.641 --> 19:55.220
Roast beef, swordfish, grilled onions,

19:55.433 --> 19:57.312
and a hot dog
hidden in there somewhere.

19:57.349 --> 19:58.463
- Wow.
- Mmm!

19:58.500 --> 20:00.289
Hard to believe
you're still single, Otter.

20:00.353 --> 20:01.971
Screw you, Cat!

20:02.064 --> 20:04.273
Geez. What's with the hostility?

20:04.330 --> 20:06.888
Who was it that said I was
the only fence on the island

20:06.949 --> 20:08.488
because I'd eaten the others?

20:08.563 --> 20:09.696
That was a cheap shot!

20:09.733 --> 20:10.912
That was a misquote.

20:10.949 --> 20:12.618
That was a wiretap transcript!

20:12.655 --> 20:14.460
Fine. I said it.

20:15.063 --> 20:18.562
<i>But</i> who tipped you off
before the arrests were made

20:18.599 --> 20:20.743
so you weren't busted
as a criminal associate?

20:20.780 --> 20:22.975
Why the hell would you show
your face in the Reef again?

20:23.023 --> 20:24.312
Well, it's a long story.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.472
The short version is,
I'm looking for a grommet.

20:26.583 --> 20:28.892
He's got blond hair, no beard,

20:29.185 --> 20:31.682
a Paulownia 6'1 Walrus.

20:31.719 --> 20:34.559
I'd know one of your custom-made
boards anywhere, Otter.

20:35.884 --> 20:37.326
Okay.

20:37.933 --> 20:39.796
You're looking for Lonnie. Yeah?

20:39.833 --> 20:41.472
He's crashing with some lowlifes

20:41.509 --> 20:44.562
at this, uh, green-roof house
on the Back River.

20:44.633 --> 20:46.186
You know... the one
Manny G. used to rent.

20:46.223 --> 20:48.609
Yeah. Are they...
Are they <i> dangerous</i> lowlifes?

20:48.646 --> 20:50.599
Look, all Lonnie said was

20:50.636 --> 20:52.216
that they were these hard guys

20:52.253 --> 20:53.972
with a big-dollar plan.

20:54.427 --> 20:55.942
- Okay.
- Yeah.

20:56.067 --> 20:58.405
Hey, what do you know
about Mike Torrance's kid?

20:58.442 --> 21:00.138
She punched me in the surf today.

21:00.224 --> 21:01.392
- Petra?
- Yeah.

21:01.429 --> 21:02.642
Where's she living?

21:02.716 --> 21:04.935
I see her camped
on the beach sometimes.

21:05.044 --> 21:07.022
You know, she just turns up
here and there,

21:07.168 --> 21:09.083
kind of a stray dog vibe,

21:09.143 --> 21:11.224
somewhere between mean and tough.

21:12.174 --> 21:13.674
Sound familiar?

21:16.895 --> 21:19.274
Enjoy your sandwich!

22:26.868 --> 22:28.182
Oh, my God.

22:32.161 --> 22:34.251
This is not what it looks like.

22:35.799 --> 22:38.317
Start at the top, work your way down.

22:39.259 --> 22:41.769
So, you're back at the hotel,
where I told you to be?

22:41.806 --> 22:43.845
Well, telling me was
your first mistake.

22:44.033 --> 22:45.775
Listen, um, it's...

22:49.457 --> 22:51.665
His name is Lonnie, he was crashing

22:51.702 --> 22:53.622
- with an ex-Navy SEAL...
- Ex-Navy SEAL named Billy Knox.

22:53.659 --> 22:54.725
Yeah, we know.

22:54.762 --> 22:56.145
He's been renting the house since...

22:56.597 --> 22:57.884
Why am I even telling you this?

22:57.921 --> 22:59.241
I don't know, because my investigation

22:59.277 --> 23:00.365
got here faster than yours?

23:00.402 --> 23:03.111
This isn't an investigation.
This is breaking and entering.

23:03.149 --> 23:06.117
I think that Knox killed Lonnie
after he grabbed Tori Eastland.

23:06.154 --> 23:07.688
Now, listen, I know
I should've called you,

23:07.725 --> 23:09.373
but I wasn't exactly feeling the...

23:09.410 --> 23:10.529
Really?

23:10.566 --> 23:12.209
Oh! You've got to be kidding me!

23:12.275 --> 23:15.100
You know, I pictured this moment
going somewhat differently.

23:15.145 --> 23:16.224
Me too.

23:16.303 --> 23:17.974
For one thing,
the cuffs were fur-lined.

23:18.123 --> 23:19.725
Ow!

23:33.239 --> 23:34.394
Petra?

23:49.106 --> 23:50.426
Hey.

23:53.151 --> 23:54.582
Okay.

23:56.139 --> 23:58.188
The knife is an Ontario MK 3...

23:58.275 --> 24:00.076
U.S. Navy SEAL standard issue.

24:00.154 --> 24:02.357
Serial number came back
to Billy Knox...

24:02.394 --> 24:04.433
dishonorably discharged last year.

24:04.515 --> 24:06.500
He's been working as
a diving instructor at Mako's,

24:06.537 --> 24:08.104
where he met Tori Eastland.

24:08.267 --> 24:11.002
That's how he knew the layout
and her routine.

24:11.225 --> 24:13.604
And he's in the wind,
but now that we have an ID...

24:13.682 --> 24:15.971
Why is Cat Chambers under arrest?

24:16.166 --> 24:19.215
Because I don't think we can trust her.

24:19.565 --> 24:21.864
<i>And</i> she burglarized Knox's house.

24:21.901 --> 24:23.567
Sounds like she was trying to help

24:23.604 --> 24:25.104
and she got there first.

24:25.190 --> 24:26.549
By, like...

24:26.791 --> 24:28.018
five minutes.

24:28.142 --> 24:29.854
What's your problem with...

24:31.702 --> 24:33.031
You slept with her?

24:33.068 --> 24:34.521
Uh, before...

24:34.947 --> 24:37.330
<i>before</i> I knew who she was.

24:37.386 --> 24:40.380
I went out on a limb
getting you promoted.

24:43.599 --> 24:46.268
Eastland trusts Chambers.
So do the kidnappers.

24:46.320 --> 24:47.332
Cut her loose.

24:47.369 --> 24:49.669
Oh, so now the guy with
the biggest house on the island

24:49.706 --> 24:51.245
tells us how to do our jobs?

24:51.395 --> 24:54.091
The man whose name is
on half the parks and museums

24:54.128 --> 24:56.974
and three streets on the island
tells the <i> Governor.</i>

24:57.107 --> 24:59.434
Who tells me. Then I tell <i> you.</i>

24:59.526 --> 25:01.763
Tori Eastland has a knife
held to her throat

25:01.800 --> 25:04.299
by a trained killer
the Navy couldn't control.

25:04.435 --> 25:06.356
We can't count on an ex-Shorepound

25:06.392 --> 25:08.183
thief who could still be working.

25:09.045 --> 25:10.714
I'm sorry... am I boring you?

25:10.751 --> 25:12.500
Eastland just got
another ransom message.

25:12.537 --> 25:15.739
<i>Cat Chambers comes alone
in a marked police boat</i>

25:15.846 --> 25:17.622
<i>to the following coordinates.</i>

25:17.659 --> 25:20.630
<i>If they see one helicopter
in the sky or...</i>

25:20.685 --> 25:22.731
<i>or one other boat in the water...</i>

25:23.607 --> 25:25.026
<i>they will kill me...</i>

25:33.645 --> 25:37.435
You're delivering $6 million
to Hermit's Atoll in 58 minutes.

25:37.552 --> 25:39.783
Oh. Lucky me.

25:41.372 --> 25:44.046
Hey, um, the guard said she's in here

25:44.083 --> 25:45.790
for shoplifting a couple beers.

25:45.827 --> 25:47.835
Okay if I pay her bail
before we head out?

25:47.872 --> 25:48.992
No.

25:49.029 --> 25:51.546
Okay, Wyatt, alright? I'm sorry, okay?

25:51.583 --> 25:53.604
I should've called you
when I got the address.

25:53.646 --> 25:55.398
It's just... I have trust issues, okay?

25:55.435 --> 25:57.394
Yeah. Mainly that you can't be trusted.

25:57.623 --> 25:59.685
I'm trying to be a better person here.

25:59.722 --> 26:01.021
Who is she to you?

26:01.501 --> 26:02.942
Well...

26:03.380 --> 26:05.502
She's kind of the bad end
to a worse story.

26:05.539 --> 26:06.778
I, um...

26:06.815 --> 26:09.815
Listen, if things go south
out there today, I just...

26:11.060 --> 26:14.310
I'd like to put a couple checks
in the plus column, you know?

26:15.698 --> 26:17.284
Sure.

26:18.787 --> 26:20.286
Thanks.

26:20.323 --> 26:21.692
You're scared.

26:35.605 --> 26:37.559
We're here, even if you can't see us.

26:37.662 --> 26:39.251
We got three transponders on you.

26:39.416 --> 26:40.502
Why?

26:40.539 --> 26:42.981
In case I look at $6 million
sitting next to me

26:43.018 --> 26:45.064
and decide to go left instead of right?

26:45.151 --> 26:46.398
Yeah, that <i> did</i> come up.

26:46.435 --> 26:47.485
Ha ha!

26:49.623 --> 26:50.832
Now, don't protect the money.

26:50.869 --> 26:52.604
You worry about Tori Eastland's safety.

26:52.718 --> 26:53.887
And yours.

26:53.924 --> 26:55.432
In which order, Wyatt?

26:55.583 --> 26:57.010
Which do you think?

27:03.823 --> 27:05.501
I think I got her.

27:13.227 --> 27:15.031
Tori! Are you okay?

27:15.164 --> 27:17.326
I'm Cat. I'm here to help.

27:17.645 --> 27:20.344
You'd better get away
before they blow up the boat!

27:20.652 --> 27:22.523
I'm pulling the plug,
dispatching bomb squad.

27:22.602 --> 27:24.394
I'm supposed to call them.

27:24.656 --> 27:26.954
Alright, then. Call them.

27:32.296 --> 27:33.961
<i>You were supposed to come alone.</i>

27:34.719 --> 27:37.727
<i>Tell those boats to back off... now!</i>

27:38.069 --> 27:39.613
Back off and drift to starboard.

27:39.680 --> 27:41.242
<i>Let me see the bag.</i>

27:41.279 --> 27:44.144
Alright. Got it right here.

27:44.594 --> 27:46.242
<i>Toss it over the side.</i>

27:46.364 --> 27:49.528
Just do what he says
and don't talk about the bomb.

27:49.719 --> 27:52.305
Let's talk about that bomb first.

27:53.397 --> 27:54.607
<i>Watch this.</i>

27:54.895 --> 27:57.928
Aah!

27:58.284 --> 27:59.727
<i>Now</i> are you gonna listen to me?

28:04.842 --> 28:06.407
Dump the money <i> now.</i>

28:06.444 --> 28:09.118
I'm putting the money
in the water, okay?

28:10.993 --> 28:12.382
<i>When the money's counted,</i>

28:12.419 --> 28:15.498
<i>I will text you a seven-digit
code to disable the bomb.</i>

28:17.177 --> 28:19.483
He's got a diver down there.
He just snagged the bag.

28:19.520 --> 28:21.099
It's time to back away now, Cat.

28:35.519 --> 28:36.969
Cat...

28:37.333 --> 28:38.483
Come on.

28:38.551 --> 28:39.962
You can put the phone down.

28:40.395 --> 28:42.707
He's, uh... he's calling back, though.

28:42.744 --> 28:44.326
Sure, maybe.

28:44.649 --> 28:46.018
How'd you get out here, anyway?

28:46.093 --> 28:47.170
Scuba gear.

28:47.207 --> 28:49.691
They've got some kind of,
um, underwater sled.

28:49.728 --> 28:50.858
Who's "they"?

28:50.895 --> 28:52.934
Billy Knox and two other guys
I don't know.

28:52.971 --> 28:55.170
They've been keeping me
in their camp on the north side.

28:55.207 --> 28:56.401
Get that, Wyatt?

28:56.438 --> 28:57.856
Yeah, copy that.

28:58.072 --> 28:59.579
Cutters Charlie and Echo,

28:59.616 --> 29:01.583
come around from the north
and south side of the atoll.

29:01.620 --> 29:03.313
Everyone be advised that the suspects

29:03.350 --> 29:05.512
may be using
a diver propulsion vehicle.

29:06.378 --> 29:07.797
Don't even think about it, Cat.

29:07.834 --> 29:10.783
Billy Knox and his friends
are currently distracted

29:10.928 --> 29:13.347
by counting the money and the cops.

29:13.384 --> 29:15.803
So what say you and I
stop staring at each other

29:15.840 --> 29:17.252
and haul ass out of here?

29:17.517 --> 29:19.016
Let me get you untied.

29:19.204 --> 29:20.695
He said to wait for the code.

29:20.770 --> 29:21.976
He's a kidnapper.

29:22.013 --> 29:23.671
Not someone you can
really take at their word.

29:23.708 --> 29:24.703
What I do know

29:24.740 --> 29:26.538
is that Billy Knox
is gonna open that bag

29:26.593 --> 29:28.623
and find $30,000

29:28.660 --> 29:30.489
and a whole bunch of nautical line.

29:31.015 --> 29:32.421
Are you crazy?

29:32.513 --> 29:35.212
Well, the theory <i> has</i> been
floated to me once or twice.

29:35.264 --> 29:36.723
We got to go.

29:36.935 --> 29:38.413
Oh, my God.

29:56.109 --> 29:57.437
Ohh!

29:57.581 --> 29:59.450
Ohh! Ohh!

30:09.817 --> 30:11.450
Go! Get ready! Let's go!

30:19.054 --> 30:20.250
Cheers.

30:22.049 --> 30:23.338
Ugh.

30:23.441 --> 30:25.440
So, we found
the other two kidnappers...

30:25.605 --> 30:28.124
facedown in the atoll,
still in their scuba gear,

30:28.161 --> 30:29.585
bullets in the back of their heads.

30:29.622 --> 30:32.173
Ah. I guess Billy Knox
didn't want to share.

30:32.572 --> 30:34.718
<i>Police are still
searching for a third suspect</i>

30:34.755 --> 30:36.338
<i>in the kidnapping of Tori Eastland.</i>

30:36.417 --> 30:39.688
<i>I want to thank the hundreds
of thousands of people</i>

30:39.725 --> 30:42.008
<i>who offered me their hopes and prayers</i>

30:42.045 --> 30:44.079
<i>across all of
my social media platforms.</i>

30:45.533 --> 30:46.829
That's it?

30:46.918 --> 30:50.149
S-She thanks her flippin'
Twitter followers and not us?

30:50.192 --> 30:52.021
Well, you did almost get her blown up.

30:52.058 --> 30:54.937
And that! What the hell
was Billy Knox thinking?

30:55.105 --> 30:56.477
You're expecting $6 million.

30:56.514 --> 30:59.013
You don't just give up
your collateral that easy.

30:59.204 --> 31:00.618
That's why you held back
the ransom money.

31:00.655 --> 31:02.492
You were trying to control the action.

31:02.611 --> 31:04.062
Hey, uh...

31:04.398 --> 31:06.078
you know, you did good.

31:07.043 --> 31:09.438
Made the right calls, you're
asking the right questions.

31:09.617 --> 31:11.975
All in a day's work.

31:12.511 --> 31:14.738
Try to keep your enthusiasm
from bubbling over.

31:14.775 --> 31:16.395
No, it's not... it's...

31:19.383 --> 31:21.180
I've been on this same hamster wheel

31:21.217 --> 31:22.966
since I was 17 years old, you know?

31:23.003 --> 31:26.100
Chase waves, steal money
to chase more waves,

31:26.137 --> 31:27.564
and...

31:28.141 --> 31:30.422
I don't know, I'm thinking
maybe it's time

31:30.975 --> 31:33.086
to stand still for a while...

31:33.252 --> 31:36.162
let some unfinished business
catch up with me.

31:42.435 --> 31:43.684
Wyatt.

31:43.852 --> 31:45.071
What?

31:45.153 --> 31:47.681
I think Knox blew that boat up

31:47.736 --> 31:49.695
because he didn't check the money.

31:49.775 --> 31:52.863
He assumed it was all there.

31:53.565 --> 31:55.407
Kills his partners

31:55.815 --> 31:58.501
and then uses the explosion
as a getaway plan.

31:59.511 --> 32:00.845
Which...

32:01.565 --> 32:03.393
Um, I need another shot,

32:03.430 --> 32:04.891
you need another fruity drink, and...

32:04.928 --> 32:06.014
- Uh...
- This round's on me,

32:06.051 --> 32:07.412
- and I'll be right back.
- Look, I... Agh!

32:23.239 --> 32:24.371
Hi!

32:24.408 --> 32:27.568
Wow, kayaking in the very same
place you just got kidnapped...

32:27.605 --> 32:29.411
with a deranged killer on the loose.

32:29.448 --> 32:31.099
You are one brave girl.

32:31.185 --> 32:33.755
He's got to be, uh,
halfway to New Guinea by now.

32:33.845 --> 32:34.895
New bodyguard?

32:34.931 --> 32:36.894
Yeah. Daddy fired Rocko.

32:37.050 --> 32:39.122
Rocko must have been the tricky part.

32:39.935 --> 32:43.471
You needed a witness so everyone
would know you disappeared.

32:44.783 --> 32:46.050
What are you talking about?

32:46.098 --> 32:47.182
- Private beach!
- All good...

32:47.219 --> 32:48.247
I'll stay on the other
side of the reef.

32:48.284 --> 32:50.268
You used Lonnie
to distract your bodyguard.

32:50.315 --> 32:53.104
The divers knew exactly where
to find you on your kayak...

32:55.736 --> 32:57.660
when to grab you, where to grab you.

33:00.707 --> 33:02.416
Yeah, I couldn't figure it out.

33:02.457 --> 33:04.786
Why the hell would she kidnap herself?

33:04.823 --> 33:08.774
And then I saw you on TV,
and it all made sense.

33:08.925 --> 33:11.659
<i>One</i> reporter
for a rich girl missing at sea,

33:11.696 --> 33:14.479
a bunch more when it turns out
to be a kidnapping,

33:14.596 --> 33:18.050
and then the whole circus
descends on the Reef

33:18.182 --> 33:20.294
for your stunning rescue.

33:20.547 --> 33:22.573
The money was for Billy Knox.

33:22.753 --> 33:24.420
You just wanted the fame.

33:26.066 --> 33:28.685
I live on an island no one knows about

33:28.722 --> 33:31.841
with a last name
my father pays a team of lawyers

33:31.878 --> 33:33.894
to keep out of the news.

33:34.042 --> 33:36.144
I can't build a brand that way.

33:36.253 --> 33:38.339
<i>That's</i> what this was about?

33:38.978 --> 33:40.387
Selling perfume?

33:40.432 --> 33:42.730
- A reality TV show?
- Oh, reality TV?

33:42.767 --> 33:45.351
Come on. This isn't 1990-something.

33:45.467 --> 33:47.096
In the last week, I have jumped

33:47.145 --> 33:51.104
from 25,000 followers
to Kendall and Gigi numbers.

33:51.291 --> 33:53.387
And I haven't even started sharing

33:53.435 --> 33:58.434
the inspirational details
of my struggle for survival.

33:58.600 --> 34:00.182
Your daddy on board with this?

34:00.223 --> 34:03.052
Daddy's just happy
to have me back in one piece.

34:03.518 --> 34:04.966
Is this why you're here?

34:05.003 --> 34:07.104
Want to shake me down
for some hush money?

34:07.276 --> 34:08.569
Who'd believe <i> me?</i>

34:08.815 --> 34:11.724
I'm just a washed-up surfer
and an unconvicted thief.

34:11.784 --> 34:14.946
No, I am not your problem.

34:15.188 --> 34:19.068
Billy Knox, however,
has a very nasty habit

34:19.105 --> 34:20.893
of murdering his partners.

34:21.002 --> 34:22.473
Shooting them is
probably the best thing

34:22.510 --> 34:23.603
he's done in his life.

34:23.641 --> 34:25.341
What about Lonnie?

34:25.643 --> 34:27.420
Did <i> he</i> deserve to die?

34:28.248 --> 34:30.088
Yeah, that's what I thought.

34:31.670 --> 34:33.112
Good luck out there.

34:33.583 --> 34:34.971
Hey.

34:35.014 --> 34:37.500
Hey, wait a minute. I'll pay you
whatever you want, okay?

34:46.447 --> 34:47.958
Come on! Run!

34:54.078 --> 34:55.909
Go, go, go, go, go!

34:58.401 --> 35:01.284
I want you to get inside the house.
I got a gun in the car.

35:03.590 --> 35:05.669
- You're leaving me?!
- Get in! Go!

35:11.547 --> 35:13.098
Aah!

35:32.650 --> 35:33.940
Jake!

35:35.399 --> 35:36.774
Are you okay?

35:37.125 --> 35:39.324
Hey. Oh, my God, are you okay?

35:39.371 --> 35:40.450
Hi.

35:40.506 --> 35:41.845
- Hey.
- Hi.

35:42.047 --> 35:43.645
I want my damn car back.

35:45.983 --> 35:47.228
Oh, careful.

35:54.319 --> 35:57.238
<i>All units, code 4.
45 Pacific Point Drive.</i>

36:05.834 --> 36:07.650
I didn't know if you'd show up.

36:08.428 --> 36:09.604
'Course you did.

36:09.709 --> 36:11.894
You call, I jump.

36:14.444 --> 36:16.701
- Hey.
- Hey!

36:16.811 --> 36:18.178
I was sitting right there.

36:18.309 --> 36:20.144
You could've told me
what you were thinking.

36:20.514 --> 36:21.623
Uh...

36:21.660 --> 36:24.764
She called me because no one's
really sure who you answer to.

36:25.277 --> 36:28.284
That, and she hasn't worked out
which of your buttons to push.

36:29.215 --> 36:30.425
Yet.

36:35.515 --> 36:38.861
Well, it seems I owe you
for my daughter's life <i> again...</i>

36:38.935 --> 36:40.896
and for recovering my $6 million.

36:40.933 --> 36:42.521
How much do you know?

36:43.775 --> 36:46.224
All three kidnappers are dead.

36:46.509 --> 36:50.454
And what you seem to believe
could be construed as slander.

36:50.725 --> 36:53.778
A <i> legal</i> threat from the most
powerful man on the Reef?

36:53.815 --> 36:56.754
That's... not impressive.

36:58.673 --> 37:00.309
Well, believe me,

37:00.446 --> 37:03.724
I have no illusions
about my daughter's foibles.

37:03.814 --> 37:05.183
But I bet you spend a lot of time

37:05.220 --> 37:07.048
cleaning up after them, don't you?

37:07.267 --> 37:08.681
Yeah.

37:08.900 --> 37:10.855
And after this latest misadventure...

37:10.892 --> 37:13.361
I'm gonna be tightening the leash.

37:13.515 --> 37:17.019
So you consider four murders
a misadventure?

37:17.056 --> 37:19.974
That... That is good to know.

37:20.037 --> 37:22.591
What I want to know is
what I can do for <i> you.</i>

37:24.813 --> 37:26.027
Well...

37:26.119 --> 37:29.279
I <i> have</i> always wanted to live
in a house on the beach.

37:50.407 --> 37:51.457
Hey.

37:53.142 --> 37:54.862
You know the Eastland beach house?

37:54.899 --> 37:56.377
Sure. But why?

37:56.414 --> 37:58.243
There's a boathouse attached to it,

37:58.298 --> 37:59.511
a key above the door.

37:59.548 --> 38:01.978
If you ever need a place to stay
or dump your crap,

38:02.057 --> 38:03.462
it's yours.

38:03.548 --> 38:05.767
I'm not going there.
That's the rich girl's place.

38:05.892 --> 38:08.361
Not anymore. It's mine now.

38:08.543 --> 38:10.183
Her father made her
move back home with him.

38:10.220 --> 38:13.143
- Long story.
- Going home is a punishment?

38:14.311 --> 38:15.603
For some.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.250
You really think the key to a boathouse

38:18.287 --> 38:19.973
makes everything okay?

38:21.071 --> 38:22.394
No.

38:22.915 --> 38:24.724
I don't.

38:24.868 --> 38:27.839
I could tell you
<i>why</i> I killed your father

38:27.876 --> 38:29.604
and how I <i> had</i> to.

38:29.951 --> 38:31.821
It won't make any difference.

38:33.275 --> 38:36.012
A warm place is a warm place,

38:36.049 --> 38:37.525
and most of the world isn't.

38:37.562 --> 38:38.929
Just...

38:40.145 --> 38:42.104
take it from someone who knows.

38:49.189 --> 38:50.884
Oh, and, um...

38:51.782 --> 38:53.508
stay off my waves, you little punk.

39:15.034 --> 39:17.743
Housewarming gift
from the Governor's office.

39:18.290 --> 39:19.978
Wow.

39:20.282 --> 39:21.537
Okay.

39:21.574 --> 39:24.001
Got to admit, you take
your hush money in style.

39:24.038 --> 39:26.470
It's only hush money if saying
something would make a difference.

39:26.507 --> 39:29.299
Tori's not the first poor little
rich girl to get away with...

39:29.336 --> 39:30.697
Murder?

39:30.832 --> 39:32.791
Don't make the same mistake
her father made.

39:32.828 --> 39:35.827
She isn't dumb,
and she didn't get lucky.

39:35.864 --> 39:37.502
She knew she'd get
figured out eventually,

39:37.539 --> 39:40.040
so she set up all the angles
so she'd get away with it.

39:40.224 --> 39:42.564
Living in her house
is vigilante justice?

39:42.668 --> 39:44.103
Works for me.

39:45.642 --> 39:47.691
Are you really planning
to stay on the Reef?

39:47.760 --> 39:49.589
I don't have anywhere else to be.

39:49.660 --> 39:51.132
Be or go?

39:51.254 --> 39:55.532
Uh, I'm either gonna
really like you or really... not.

39:58.770 --> 40:00.986
Well, I'm hoping for the former,

40:01.082 --> 40:03.702
since the Governor would like
to put you on a retainer.

40:06.215 --> 40:08.294
A retainer? To do what?

40:08.374 --> 40:10.330
Our island has unique problems.

40:10.940 --> 40:13.479
Sometimes the police just need
an outside pair of eyes.

40:13.629 --> 40:16.255
Some problems, the police
don't even need to know about.

40:16.292 --> 40:17.581
Some problems, you need a...

40:17.618 --> 40:18.856
A fixer?

40:18.980 --> 40:21.689
Someone who can think fast
and keep quiet.

40:21.726 --> 40:24.096
What makes you so sure
I can keep quiet?

40:24.177 --> 40:27.336
I'm sitting on your beach in
front of your new beach house.

40:27.706 --> 40:29.604
Good point.

40:29.819 --> 40:31.988
If you call, I'll answer the phone.

40:32.440 --> 40:34.471
But other than that,
I'm a slave to my conscience,

40:34.508 --> 40:35.558
such as it is.

40:35.596 --> 40:38.009
So... a case-by-case basis.

40:38.393 --> 40:40.162
Case-by-case basis.

40:48.028 --> 40:50.916
I was gonna suggest you stop
sleeping with my brother,

40:50.953 --> 40:52.624
but neither of you seems inclined

40:52.661 --> 40:54.240
to self-restraint in that department.

40:58.849 --> 41:00.768
Wyatt Cole is your brother?

41:00.805 --> 41:02.384
Half-brother, yeah.

41:02.421 --> 41:05.528
I had no idea.

41:05.565 --> 41:08.524
- I thought...
- Well, now you know.
