I-I want to be an actress, but
soon as I tell my parents

00:03.212 --> 00:05.171
that they're just gonna
yank my ass back home.

00:05.172 --> 00:08.257
Don't tell them and come to the
"Locked" audition with me.

00:08.258 --> 00:10.760

he's into you, too.</i>

00:19.330 --> 00:21.206
<i>So do something about it.</i>

00:21.207 --> 00:24.251
We should talk about
this after your play.

00:24.252 --> 00:25.836
Can we just pretend
you're behind us?

00:25.837 --> 00:26.920
<i>The real story isn't
about Rainer.</i>

00:26.921 --> 00:28.130
<i>It's about Tangey Turner.</i>

00:28.131 --> 00:31.175
That slut who cheated on
my son with Jordan Wilder.

00:33.346 --> 00:36.230
Paige, I wanted to
call you personally.

00:38.182 --> 00:39.182
You got the part.

00:45.727 --> 00:47.816
♪ Well if I'm sittin'
at a bus stop ♪

00:47.817 --> 00:50.694
♪ Listening to hip-hop ♪

00:50.891 --> 00:52.821
'Aren't you headed to the
studio this morning?'

00:52.822 --> 00:55.031
I am, but I need to
finish my spreadsheet

00:55.032 --> 00:56.324
before my parents
get here later.

00:56.325 --> 00:57.993
Paige, it's not like
you're telling them

00:57.994 --> 00:59.327
you're becoming a sister-wife.

00:59.328 --> 01:01.913
You landed the lead
in a huge movie.

01:01.914 --> 01:03.582
- How mad can they get?
- My dad's a teacher.

01:03.583 --> 01:05.709
And education means
everything to him.

01:05.710 --> 01:07.461
If I drop out, I'll
be the first person

01:07.462 --> 01:09.421
in my family to not
get a college degree.

01:09.422 --> 01:12.132
So... that mess of numbers
is your big plan?

01:12.133 --> 01:14.593
Yes, my dad's mantra
is numbers don't lie.

01:14.594 --> 01:16.219
So this is how I prove to him

01:16.220 --> 01:18.889
that I can still be in
school and do the movie.

01:20.183 --> 01:23.018
Oh, uh, I've got Bio,
but I'll be back later

01:23.019 --> 01:24.186
to help you guys
clean the apartment.

01:24.187 --> 01:25.228
- Thanks.
- Well.

01:25.229 --> 01:26.021
Get this place in shape

01:26.022 --> 01:27.189
before your parents get here.

01:27.190 --> 01:28.899
I thought Bio was on Tuesdays.

01:28.900 --> 01:32.319
Did I say "Bio?" Slap me awake.
I meant Psych.

01:32.320 --> 01:34.768
Well, good luck at your
scary producer meeting.

01:35.072 --> 01:37.199
- Love you.
- Love you more.

01:37.200 --> 01:39.451
Any idea why Nina
wants to see you?

01:39.452 --> 01:41.161
Well, I mean, it
can't be to fire me.

01:41.162 --> 01:42.671
I haven't even
done anything yet.

01:43.289 --> 01:45.207
Do you wanna have coffee after?

01:45.208 --> 01:49.252
Actually, I got a call from
that agent who read my script.

01:49.253 --> 01:50.295
No way!

01:50.296 --> 01:51.713
And he wants to have a meeting.

01:51.714 --> 01:53.715
- Why didn't you tell us?
- It's just a meeting.

01:53.716 --> 01:55.175
I'm not letting you
downplay this.

01:55.176 --> 01:57.762
Just having somebody like
that read your script is...

02:01.599 --> 02:03.226
really...

02:03.702 --> 02:05.008
awesome.

02:08.021 --> 02:10.607
We should have that
talk, you know.

02:10.608 --> 02:13.109
The, the talk that we've been
talking about, talking about

02:13.110 --> 02:16.321
but we still haven't actually
talked about it? That-that talk.

02:16.322 --> 02:18.448
I think it's a little
scary how I can

02:18.449 --> 02:20.117
interpret your "Paige speak."

02:21.410 --> 02:22.701
But, yeah, I do know.

02:23.496 --> 02:25.081
We'll talk about it later, okay?

02:27.265 --> 02:28.937
- Good luck.
- Good luck.

what would happen

out about us.

We're two adults, there's nothing

Tangey Turner.

03:22.221 --> 03:24.180
What? No. How did he find out?

03:24.181 --> 03:26.182
My secret source also revealed

03:26.183 --> 03:27.976
that Jordan only had
good intentions

03:27.977 --> 03:29.978
'when he checked in on
his best friend's girl.'

03:29.979 --> 03:31.604
But after he had
too much to drink

03:31.605 --> 03:33.648
Tangey turned on
her sultry charm

03:33.649 --> 03:36.109
'and poor Jordan
couldn't resist her.'

03:36.110 --> 03:38.194
That's not what happened.
Who told him that?

03:38.195 --> 03:40.196
Tangey must've
confided in someone.

03:40.197 --> 03:41.990
You know we hooked up, but
it didn't go down like that.

03:41.991 --> 03:43.242
We weren't even drinking.

03:54.170 --> 03:56.629
Good morning! Hi,
I'm Paige Townsen.

03:56.630 --> 03:58.006
There's no D in the end.

03:58.007 --> 04:00.467
- Do you have a drive on, miss?
- I should and, uh...

04:00.468 --> 04:02.693
You can just call
me Paige, uh...

04:03.380 --> 04:04.804
Roberto.

04:04.805 --> 04:07.349
Anyways, uh, I'm gonna be
coming in and out of here a lot

04:07.350 --> 04:10.435
so, you know, we could be
on a first-name basis.

04:10.460 --> 04:12.253
We're all on the
same team, right?

04:12.772 --> 04:14.176
Photo ID, please.

04:14.795 --> 04:18.027
Oh. Uh, uh. Yeah, of course.
Sure.

04:19.652 --> 04:21.637
'Where's my driver's license?'

04:22.406 --> 04:24.075
Oh, there you go.

04:25.618 --> 04:26.701
That's a school ID card.

04:26.702 --> 04:29.079
I'll need a valid
driver's license.

04:30.790 --> 04:34.084
Um, oh, come on,
look at that face.

04:34.085 --> 04:35.960
Don't you just wanna let me in?

04:35.961 --> 04:38.880
You're gonna need to make a
U-turn and exit immediately.

04:38.881 --> 04:42.592
Uh, n-no, sorry, I can't.
No, no. Uh, hold on.

04:42.593 --> 04:44.928
I'll find it, let me find it.
I know I have it in here.

04:44.929 --> 04:46.227
It's just...

04:46.847 --> 04:48.723
- 'I really need to be...'
- Security One.

04:48.724 --> 04:51.393
I have to be in Nina Devon's
office in two minutes

04:51.394 --> 04:53.353
and it's my first day,
so I can't be late...

04:53.354 --> 04:54.522
Good morning.

04:56.691 --> 04:58.499
- Hi.
- Everything okay?

04:58.818 --> 05:01.277
- Not really.
- You know her, Mr. Devon?

05:01.278 --> 05:02.897
This is Paige Townsen.

05:03.489 --> 05:04.988
She's gonna be a big star.

05:07.535 --> 05:09.203
'Whatever you say, boss.'

05:11.045 --> 05:12.171
Thank you.

05:19.004 --> 05:20.423
Would you please stop?

05:22.425 --> 05:25.301
There's a lot riding on
tomorrow night's casting party.

05:25.302 --> 05:27.387
We're over budget, and for
now, the studio's looking

05:27.388 --> 05:30.140
the other way, but I, I can't
have you going off on Hopper.

05:30.141 --> 05:31.433
And I can't have the
world hating on Tangey

05:31.434 --> 05:32.475
for something we both did.

05:32.476 --> 05:34.635
I get it, I'll fix it.

05:34.979 --> 05:36.596
Now, just relax.

05:42.820 --> 05:45.307
You know that I've invested
everything in "Locked."

05:46.031 --> 05:47.699
And you know how much I
need this movie to work.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.627
- Right?
- Of course.

05:49.952 --> 05:53.246
So, stay away from
Rainer and Barrett

05:53.247 --> 05:55.749
until I get a chance to
work this out and...

05:55.750 --> 05:58.875
Don't talk to Tangey until I can
smooth things over with her manager.

06:09.305 --> 06:11.431
'Did I ask you to set that
meeting for tomorrow?'

06:11.432 --> 06:12.766
- No, but...
- There's that word again.

06:12.767 --> 06:16.361
I pay you so I can hear "Yes. Nina, yes.
I made it happen."

06:17.188 --> 06:18.207
Sit, sit.

06:18.731 --> 06:22.358
Well, that's what an Ivy League
education buys you these days.

06:22.359 --> 06:23.694
"No, but..."

06:24.820 --> 06:26.111
How's it going?

06:26.572 --> 06:29.407
- I'm a little nervous.
- Do you wanna see a doctor?

06:29.408 --> 06:31.307
We could get you on
a mood stabilizer.

06:31.911 --> 06:33.203
Have you been to see Giselle?

06:33.204 --> 06:34.412
What're you wearing
tomorrow night?

06:34.413 --> 06:37.540
Actually I'm meeting up with
her later this afternoon.

06:37.541 --> 06:39.918
She, uh, she sounds nice.

06:39.919 --> 06:41.169
Oh, she's a back-stabbing bitch

06:41.170 --> 06:43.838
but she's the best
stylist in town.

06:43.839 --> 06:46.549
By the way, Nina, I-I really
wanna thank you again

06:46.550 --> 06:49.427
for letting me bring my friends
to the party tomorrow night.

06:49.428 --> 06:50.970
- Are you excited?
- Totally.

06:50.971 --> 06:53.473
You know, I just,
I have this class

06:53.474 --> 06:55.391
and I'm gonna miss it,
so I kinda feel bad.

06:55.392 --> 06:58.394
But it's okay, 'cause I'm gonna
get notes from somebody there.

06:58.395 --> 07:00.186
I assumed you were
taking a gap year.

07:00.564 --> 07:04.067
Uh, of course not. I can do
the movie and stay in school.

07:04.068 --> 07:06.528
I mean, it is an ensemble piece,
just like the books, right?

07:06.529 --> 07:08.489
So, I won't be
working every day.

07:08.989 --> 07:11.407
We're playing up
the love triangle.

07:11.408 --> 07:13.618
So the role of August
is much bigger

07:13.619 --> 07:15.516
in the movies than she
was in the books.

07:16.121 --> 07:17.121
Look.

07:18.290 --> 07:21.459
Being a movie star isn't
a part-time job, Paige.

07:21.460 --> 07:22.752
You have to make a choice.

07:22.753 --> 07:25.004
Either you eat, sleep
and breath "Locked"

07:25.005 --> 07:27.423
or, or you spend the rest
of your life doing math

07:27.424 --> 07:29.230
in a poly-blend sweater set.

07:33.597 --> 07:35.808
Any chance you can come
over more than once a week?

07:37.434 --> 07:39.736
It's just that I have school.

07:40.271 --> 07:41.496
I'll pay you an extra fifty.

07:41.939 --> 07:45.483
Um, yeah, yeah, okay.

07:45.484 --> 07:47.068
I-I can make it work.

07:47.069 --> 07:49.905
Great. Look forward to it.

07:51.490 --> 07:52.754

08:24.565 --> 08:26.649
Yeah, she was
America's sweetheart.

08:38.328 --> 08:39.912
Yeah. Yeah.

08:39.913 --> 08:42.123
That's-that's, uh, that's me.

08:42.124 --> 08:44.125
Actually, it's my first
role in a movie.

08:44.126 --> 08:45.840
Hmm. That part's obvious.

08:48.589 --> 08:49.631
Wait, what?

08:49.632 --> 08:51.966
You know, Paige,
just because you won

08:51.967 --> 08:54.719
some sort of cattle call
wearing a push-up bra

08:54.720 --> 08:56.596
and some cheap hair extensions

08:56.597 --> 08:58.274
doesn't really mean
you're an actress.

09:00.267 --> 09:03.479
Part's not really yours until
the cameras start rolling.

09:16.224 --> 09:19.042
Those stories in the press
are nothing but lies.

09:19.478 --> 09:21.792
We're considering taking
legal action, Nina.

09:22.773 --> 09:25.252
Ida, we're friends, right?

09:25.568 --> 09:26.609
Ish.

09:26.610 --> 09:28.739
Let's fight bad press
with good press.

09:29.529 --> 09:30.660
I'm listening.

09:30.989 --> 09:33.778
What if Tangey booked the
main title song for "Locked?"

09:36.495 --> 09:38.630
That would create some buzz.

09:39.317 --> 09:40.356
What's in it for you?

09:40.528 --> 09:42.402
We're having a casting
party tomorrow night.

09:42.403 --> 09:44.112
We show the world that
Tangey, Rainer and Jordan

09:44.113 --> 09:47.157
are still friends.
Everybody wins.

09:47.158 --> 09:49.201
If it means good
press, I'll do it.

09:49.636 --> 09:51.245
If she needs to
reconcile with your son

09:51.246 --> 09:52.162
we can make that happen.

09:52.163 --> 09:54.248
What? No, no, no.
There's no way.

09:54.249 --> 09:55.290
Why don't we let our
children work out

09:55.291 --> 09:56.960
their own personal lives?

09:59.212 --> 10:00.212
Okay.

10:01.054 --> 10:02.297
'Fine.'

10:02.298 --> 10:03.980
If that's what you want, Nina.

10:04.634 --> 10:06.218

10:06.219 --> 10:08.095

and you gave the part

10:12.350 --> 10:14.142
to this, like,
fly-over-state amateur.

10:14.143 --> 10:16.853
Hey, I never made any promises.

10:17.067 --> 10:20.065
Paige Townsen ended up being
the best choice for the role.

10:20.066 --> 10:21.067
Okay.

10:23.069 --> 10:25.571
What about the part of
the dumbass sister?

10:25.935 --> 10:27.975
Well, I'm, I'm about to put
out an offer to someone.

10:28.350 --> 10:30.284
I want that part, Wyatt.

10:30.285 --> 10:31.570
I need it.

10:32.434 --> 10:36.748
Things have been
slow for me, lately.

10:36.749 --> 10:39.043
I'm just not sure if
you're right for it.

10:40.628 --> 10:41.796
I see.

10:52.567 --> 10:54.917
Maybe there's a way I
can audition privately.

10:56.441 --> 10:58.731
Alexis, just stop.

10:59.612 --> 11:02.190
I like you, I really like you.

11:02.191 --> 11:04.401
It's always fun
when you're around.

11:04.402 --> 11:05.402
What?

11:05.403 --> 11:07.303
I'd like to take you to dinner.

11:07.930 --> 11:09.198
Seriously?

11:11.200 --> 11:12.390
Uh, um...

11:12.744 --> 11:15.997
Fine. Wh-whatever.

11:18.291 --> 11:20.626
'This place's cleaned up
pretty nice for your parents.'

11:20.627 --> 11:22.294
So who do you think is gonna
be there tomorrow night?

11:22.295 --> 11:24.504
Beyonce? Kim-ye?

11:24.505 --> 11:27.708
Nina made it sound like there's
no way I can do both and...

11:28.528 --> 11:29.605
I believe her.

11:29.630 --> 11:32.346
Look at these spreadsheets,
they don't lie.

11:36.100 --> 11:37.101
They're here.

11:39.187 --> 11:41.021
What do I do? What do I say?

11:41.022 --> 11:42.272
Paige, just breathe.

11:42.273 --> 11:45.754
And for now, just... lie.

11:46.319 --> 11:47.527
I can lie.

11:47.954 --> 11:49.018
I'm a good liar.

11:50.037 --> 11:52.163
- Guys, hi!
- 'Hi!'

11:52.188 --> 11:53.950
There's our California girl.

11:53.951 --> 11:56.631
- I missed you.
- Oh, and I missed you.

11:58.081 --> 11:59.499
Good to see you again.
Hello. Hello.

11:59.523 --> 12:01.480
Okay, guess who we
saw at the airport?

12:01.518 --> 12:02.619
Who?

12:02.644 --> 12:05.923
Carrie Ann Inaba.

12:05.948 --> 12:08.256
- She's so cool.
- And practically naked.

12:08.257 --> 12:10.884
Honey, I told you she was
wearing a halter top.

12:10.885 --> 12:12.928
Alright, is that what they're
calling a bra nowadays?

12:12.929 --> 12:14.137
'Should we get to lunch?'

12:14.138 --> 12:16.223
Honey, I'm sorry they
changed the schedule

12:16.224 --> 12:18.266
at the teacher's convention,
literally, last minute.

12:18.267 --> 12:20.102
'We're just dropping in to
say hi and we gotta run.'

12:20.103 --> 12:21.311
- No.
- 'I know.'

12:21.312 --> 12:23.438
We-we-we really wanna take
all of you out for dinner

12:23.439 --> 12:25.190
tomorrow night, okay,
and please pick a place

12:25.191 --> 12:26.483
that has famous people.

12:30.238 --> 12:34.795
We can't, uh, we-we have a
huge study group for Econ.

12:35.410 --> 12:38.870
- 'Big group study.'
- Yeah, it's a big test.

12:38.871 --> 12:41.248
- Meteoric, really.
- It's half our grade. So...

12:41.249 --> 12:43.458
No. Listen, school comes first.

12:43.459 --> 12:45.669
I'm glad to see you have
your priorities straight.

12:45.670 --> 12:47.366
'Very proud of you.'

12:47.447 --> 12:49.340
Priorities. Check.

12:54.673 --> 12:55.716
Rachel?

12:56.806 --> 12:58.473
- Alexis.
- Hi.

12:58.474 --> 13:00.434
Hey, it's been a while.

13:00.435 --> 13:03.729
Yeah, I thought you
were in New York.

13:03.730 --> 13:07.899
I was. Um, but turns out
there's no money in theatre.

13:07.900 --> 13:10.771
So, decided to give
LA another shot.

13:11.112 --> 13:12.112
Cool.

13:15.832 --> 13:18.988
Uh, so, I heard you and
Dakota are an item.

13:19.829 --> 13:21.455
- Happy for you.
- Yeah.

13:21.456 --> 13:23.999
Uh, things didn't
really work out.

13:24.000 --> 13:25.167
We wanted different things

13:25.168 --> 13:27.295
and uh, she's a bitch.

13:29.214 --> 13:31.539
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

13:33.785 --> 13:35.233
I think I'm gonna get going.

13:36.122 --> 13:39.306
Wait, hang on. We should
get a drink sometime.

13:39.307 --> 13:41.600
I'm pretty busy, getting
settled in and stuff

13:41.601 --> 13:43.993
but I'll call you when I
come up for air, okay?

13:58.910 --> 14:00.452
Is that a Cobb salad
you're eating

14:00.453 --> 14:02.162
or the remains of
your latest prey?

14:02.163 --> 14:05.499
Alan Mills, seems they'll let
anyone in here these days.

14:05.500 --> 14:07.292
Well, you're proof of that,
how much did "Bombshells"

14:07.293 --> 14:08.773
lose the studio?

14:09.545 --> 14:11.630
Surprised you're not funding
"Locked" on Kickstarter.

14:11.631 --> 14:13.548
- What do you want?
- I want my film back.

14:13.549 --> 14:14.966
Oh, it's not your film.
It never was.

14:14.967 --> 14:17.093
You stole the rights,
and you know it.

14:17.094 --> 14:18.428
Well, maybe I did
play a little dirty

14:18.429 --> 14:20.597
but it wasn't the first time
and it won't be the last.

14:20.598 --> 14:23.397
Oh, you know how
this business works

14:23.972 --> 14:25.060
because I taught you.

14:25.061 --> 14:26.728
I'm sorry, did I forget
to say thank you?

14:26.729 --> 14:29.606
- God, you're such a bitch.
- Is that the best you can do?

14:29.607 --> 14:31.525
You know, I can't
believe I used to think

14:31.526 --> 14:32.984
you're a hot piece of ass.

14:32.985 --> 14:34.945
Oh, wasn't that a requirement
to be one of your assistants?

14:34.946 --> 14:36.280
It still is.

14:38.657 --> 14:41.326
Unless you're buying my lunch,
I think we're done here.

14:41.364 --> 14:44.413
Oh, no. We're just
getting started.

14:46.374 --> 14:48.003
Enjoy your lunch.

15:11.524 --> 15:13.234
Heard you were back in town.

15:15.403 --> 15:17.272
Took you a while to get here.

15:17.989 --> 15:20.448
Yeah, well, I've had
other things on my mind.

15:20.449 --> 15:23.451
Oh, forgive me if I thought
apologizing to your boyfriend

15:23.452 --> 15:26.604
for sleeping with his best
friend might be a priority.

15:29.737 --> 15:32.752
God, you know, I'm, I'm pretty
sure to be someone's boyfriend

15:32.753 --> 15:34.212
you need to actually see them.

15:34.213 --> 15:35.630
If you had any decency

15:35.631 --> 15:37.465
you'd be apologizing to me.

15:37.466 --> 15:38.735
For what?

15:39.093 --> 15:42.137
For the dozen hook-ups you've
had since I've been gone.

15:42.138 --> 15:44.806
God, Rainer, you never even cared
about me or what I needed.

15:44.807 --> 15:46.725
What did you need, Tangey?

15:47.043 --> 15:48.043
Jordan?

15:50.563 --> 15:52.064
You still don't get it.

15:54.271 --> 15:57.389
You know, Jordan's ten times
the man that you are.

15:57.994 --> 16:00.797
And you lost me way
before I slept with him.

16:01.281 --> 16:03.795
You're just too focused on
yourself to realize it.

16:16.456 --> 16:18.123
You know you're in Beverly Hills

16:18.148 --> 16:20.614
when the floor is softer
than anything on your bed.

16:24.149 --> 16:25.983
Should I get one just like it?

16:25.984 --> 16:27.193
Birds of a feather?

16:27.357 --> 16:29.141
It's a little, uh,

16:30.533 --> 16:31.781
peacocky, right?

16:31.782 --> 16:34.792
There's nothing
peacocky about Gucci.

16:35.077 --> 16:36.494
Did you try on the Prada yet?

16:36.495 --> 16:38.121
No, wait.

16:38.122 --> 16:41.833
The Walter Mendez will
accentuate your curves better.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.960
Here's some stilettos
to complete the look.

16:43.961 --> 16:48.297
Oh, but, you know, I'm actually
really wobbly when I would...

16:48.298 --> 16:50.217
Eh, she doesn't care.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.511
I'm kind of afraid of her.

16:53.512 --> 16:55.012
'And I'm really afraid'

16:55.013 --> 16:57.098
'my parents are gonna
find out the truth.'

16:57.099 --> 17:00.143
'I mean, w-what do I do, Cass? I
lied straight to their face.'

17:00.144 --> 17:02.395
'My dad will be so
disappointed in me, and...'

17:02.396 --> 17:05.064
Paige, relax, it's
an industry party.

17:05.065 --> 17:06.941
There's no way they're
gonna hear about it.

17:06.942 --> 17:09.359
Ladies, are you almost done?
I'm starving.

17:09.361 --> 17:11.325
Almost ready, one sec.

17:22.165 --> 17:23.540
Do you like it?

17:24.209 --> 17:26.044
Amazing.

17:27.087 --> 17:28.088
Pretty.

17:29.756 --> 17:32.057
- You look pretty.
- Really?

17:38.599 --> 17:39.975
So...

17:42.186 --> 17:43.687
is this the one?

17:46.773 --> 17:48.149
- Yeah.
- 'Yeah.'

17:48.150 --> 17:51.403
'Definitely. I-I
mean, look at you.'

17:58.785 --> 18:01.037
I wanna enjoy all of this.

18:01.038 --> 18:02.122
'I do, but...'

18:03.165 --> 18:04.177
How...

18:06.168 --> 18:08.657
How am I supposed to get
through all of this?

18:09.254 --> 18:10.254
What do you mean?

18:10.438 --> 18:12.329
This. Everything.

18:12.591 --> 18:15.718
Lying to my parents,
school, this movie.

18:15.719 --> 18:17.470
It's, it's all just, it's...

18:17.471 --> 18:19.385
It's so much.

18:20.140 --> 18:22.600
It's... too much.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.807
It's just too much for
me to handle and...

18:25.479 --> 18:29.649
And now I feel like my head is
just gonna explode and I...

18:29.650 --> 18:31.026
Paige, it's okay.

18:32.736 --> 18:34.768
We're gonna help you
get through this.

18:45.123 --> 18:46.707
Thanks for the sit-down, man.

18:46.708 --> 18:48.167
This will be in our
next issue, so...

18:48.168 --> 18:50.293
Jordie Michaels, right?

18:50.371 --> 18:51.936
Nope, you've got the wrong guy.

18:52.756 --> 18:55.091
Well, I-I know you're
a big star now.

18:55.092 --> 18:57.301
But you look a lot like a guy...

18:57.302 --> 18:59.299
When you're in movies,
people think they know you.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.222
I promise you, you don't.

19:01.223 --> 19:03.684
Oh, my mistake.

19:05.143 --> 19:06.489
Have a good one, Jordie.

19:07.020 --> 19:09.022
I mean, Jordan.

19:14.861 --> 19:17.316
Happens all the time, man.
You'd be amazed.

19:17.573 --> 19:19.801
- Yeah. Thanks for your time.
- Yup, thank you.

19:29.668 --> 19:31.418
I heard they offered
you the sister role.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.088
Congrats.

19:34.840 --> 19:36.486
I'm still negotiating.

19:36.967 --> 19:38.462
I'm sorry you didn't
get the lead.

19:38.760 --> 19:41.804
Mm-hmm. So, why are
you really here?

19:41.805 --> 19:43.557
Apologies aren't
usually your thing.

19:46.268 --> 19:48.978
- Tangey dropped by.
- I know. She called me.

19:48.979 --> 19:51.314
She's actually blaming
me for the breakup.

19:51.315 --> 19:52.982
Like I forced her to
sleep with Jordan.

19:52.983 --> 19:55.151
Rain, she was lonely.

19:55.152 --> 19:56.902
You were, like, never around.

19:56.903 --> 19:59.538
- She's the one who left.
- Yeah, for work.

19:59.906 --> 20:01.574
Why do you even care? It's over.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.576
Just find someone new
like you always do

20:03.577 --> 20:06.746
and get sick of her,
and find someone else.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.165
I get it. I'm a
terrible boyfriend.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.537
Well, I wouldn't date you.

20:36.568 --> 20:38.462
You ever tell anyone
about my past?

20:39.112 --> 20:40.279
Of course not.

20:40.499 --> 20:42.560
I would never do anything

He's out of the studio.
He's our biggest ally.

21:13.397 --> 21:16.566
Without him, the entire
movie could get shut down.

21:21.488 --> 21:24.282
I'm sorry. I know we
still need to talk.

21:29.468 --> 21:31.348
Do you know what I've been
thinking about today?

21:31.957 --> 21:33.921
Freshman theater workshop.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.675
You used to come
and watch Cassie

21:35.700 --> 21:38.588
and I slept right through
that horrible one...

21:43.831 --> 21:45.638
That's when I knew we'd
be friends forever.

21:50.475 --> 21:53.832
And that's what you
need right now.

21:56.022 --> 21:57.054
A friend.

22:01.445 --> 22:04.000
It wouldn't be right
to complicate things.

22:04.520 --> 22:05.601
You know?

22:08.203 --> 22:09.326
Cassie and I were talking...

22:09.327 --> 22:11.912
What does Cassie have
to do with anything?

22:11.913 --> 22:13.956
I mean, that-that's us, right?

22:13.957 --> 22:17.085
The three <i>amigos.</i> That's how
we've been since freshmen year.

22:19.379 --> 22:22.214
- Yeah.
- A little help here.

22:22.215 --> 22:24.009
Ah, I got it. Ahem.

22:27.345 --> 22:28.746
Everything okay?

22:29.931 --> 22:31.933
Yeah. Yeah, we're fine.

22:38.521 --> 22:40.314
You almost ready? What's wrong?

22:40.315 --> 22:43.547
Um, I-I can't get my
hair out of my dress.

22:44.733 --> 22:46.595
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

22:49.699 --> 22:52.034
Oh, it's my mom.

22:52.035 --> 22:54.536
'What should I say? Do
I say we're studying?'

22:54.537 --> 22:56.813
Or you can just answer the
phone and tell me the truth.

22:58.416 --> 22:59.983
Um, y-your mom's here.

23:01.002 --> 23:04.171
Honey, you're a horrible liar.

23:04.172 --> 23:07.184
- And you always have been.
- I know, I'm sorry.

23:08.093 --> 23:09.810
- Are you mad at me?
- Mad?

23:10.571 --> 23:12.304
If you're doing what
I think you're doing

23:12.956 --> 23:15.183
I might have a heart
attack, in-in a good way.

23:15.184 --> 23:16.893
When we were here yesterday

23:16.894 --> 23:19.771
I saw the "Locked"
script on the table

23:19.772 --> 23:22.778
with your name on it, next
to the role of August.

23:23.400 --> 23:24.401
Are you...

23:26.278 --> 23:27.403
Whoa!

23:27.404 --> 23:29.155
Yeah, I know, I know. I know.

23:29.156 --> 23:30.240
I know, I know, I
know, I know, I know.

23:30.241 --> 23:33.576
Oh, my God! You won that
at an open casting call.

23:33.577 --> 23:35.119
I know all about it.
How's Rainer?

23:35.120 --> 23:36.621
I can't believe Tangey
cheated on him.

23:36.622 --> 23:39.374
I can't believe you're
doing a movie with him.

23:39.375 --> 23:41.167
Oh, my gosh! This isn't
just any movie though.

23:41.168 --> 23:42.716
This is "Locked."

23:42.962 --> 23:46.256
Honey, my book club has
read the entire series.

23:46.257 --> 23:47.340
Oh, my gosh!

23:47.341 --> 23:50.302
We thought we were excited
to see "50 Shades of Grey."

23:51.220 --> 23:53.388
Does dad know?

23:53.389 --> 23:54.556
- No.
- Oh.

23:54.557 --> 23:56.866
But I thought we could
tell him tonight.

23:57.142 --> 23:59.743
If we do it together, he'll
know how important this is.

24:02.001 --> 24:03.471
Thank you, mom.

24:08.404 --> 24:09.405
I'll get it.

24:11.407 --> 24:13.992
- Rainer!
- Cassie, right?

24:13.993 --> 24:15.743
Yeah, yeah, that's, that's me.

24:15.744 --> 24:17.580
- 'Come on in.'
- 'Thank you.'

24:19.999 --> 24:21.792
Hey, I'm Rainer.

24:22.918 --> 24:24.210
Uh, yeah, I know.

24:24.211 --> 24:25.523
We've hung out.

24:25.879 --> 24:27.630
Oh, right. Sorry.

24:27.631 --> 24:29.675
I meet a lot of people.

24:31.260 --> 24:32.886
'Okay, I'm ready.'

24:35.472 --> 24:36.640
Oh, Rainer?

24:38.267 --> 24:39.518
Hi.

24:40.769 --> 24:41.770
'Um...'

24:43.397 --> 24:47.228
What are, uh, what
are you doing here?

24:48.068 --> 24:49.783
Your rabbit's a classic.

24:50.237 --> 24:53.662
But I was thinkin'
tonight's star attraction

24:54.134 --> 24:55.641
should arrive like a star.

24:57.244 --> 24:58.479
That's your car outside.

25:03.125 --> 25:04.959
Um, there's room for everyone.

25:04.960 --> 25:06.670
Y-yes, please.

25:08.631 --> 25:11.467
You look beautiful.

25:11.717 --> 25:13.968
Thanks. You do, too.

25:13.969 --> 25:16.471
I mean, not
beautiful, of course.

25:16.472 --> 25:19.183
But, like, h-h-handsome.

25:20.559 --> 25:21.882
Very handsome.

25:23.687 --> 25:24.855
Let's go.

25:33.238 --> 25:34.301
Hey!

25:34.573 --> 25:36.032
For the record,
when you told Paige

25:36.033 --> 25:37.408
you'd rather be friends

25:37.409 --> 25:39.164
I didn't believe a word of it.

25:39.787 --> 25:41.245
But I know why you
did it and it was

25:41.246 --> 25:43.414
a pretty cool thing
for you to do.

25:43.415 --> 25:46.465
Look, I just wanted
to simplify her life.

25:47.378 --> 25:48.853
And I didn't see
that guy coming.

25:58.806 --> 26:01.140
♪ I mean what I mean

26:01.141 --> 26:03.226

26:21.286 --> 26:24.956
This is not a little party.
This is a very, very big party.

26:24.957 --> 26:27.667
Oh, my God. Is that,
is that "Extra?"

26:27.668 --> 26:29.419
- 'Is that a bad thing?'
- Oh!

26:29.420 --> 26:32.088
My mom watches that
show every night.

26:32.089 --> 26:34.465
My dad thinks I'm
studying right now.

26:34.466 --> 26:35.425
Texting her as we speak.

26:35.426 --> 26:38.919
- No TV after the pina coladas.
- Thanks, Cassie.

26:39.555 --> 26:41.723
I have to leave here
by 8:30 tonight

26:41.724 --> 26:43.391
so I can tell my dad the truth.

26:43.392 --> 26:46.269
Paige, just take a breath.
I'm here for you.

26:46.270 --> 26:49.132
Yeah, but you can't stand
by my side all night.

26:49.898 --> 26:51.867
This is R in sign language.

26:51.929 --> 26:53.320
Tonight, it's our code.

26:53.569 --> 26:56.685
If you get into a jam
just throw up a sign.

26:57.268 --> 27:00.019
Is that Kim Richards? No, wait.
That's Kim Zolciak.

27:00.200 --> 27:02.911
This is insane. It's like a
buffet of "Real Housewives."

27:05.164 --> 27:06.998
Uh, I-I need a drink.
Do-do you need a drink?

27:06.999 --> 27:08.458
Let's, let's, let's go
get, let's go get a drink.

27:08.459 --> 27:12.503
- Oh, Cassie.
- Paige! Hi. Alexis Glen.

27:12.504 --> 27:14.338
We met at the studio.
Guess what?

27:14.339 --> 27:16.174
I'm gonna be playing
your sister.

27:16.175 --> 27:17.967
I have a hunch when this is over

27:17.968 --> 27:19.427
we're gonna be sisters for life.

27:19.428 --> 27:21.137
Paige, um, I wanna
steal you here.

27:21.138 --> 27:22.472
Introduce you to some friends.

27:22.473 --> 27:24.573
- We'll see you later, Lexi.
- Okay.

27:24.725 --> 27:25.893
♪ I mean what I mean ♪

27:31.023 --> 27:33.473
- Hi.
- Hi.

27:33.817 --> 27:37.778
Wow, twice in two days.
Pretty crazy, huh?

27:37.779 --> 27:39.530
Yeah. Crazy.

27:40.741 --> 27:43.326
Uh, I'm gonna go
talk to a friend.

27:43.327 --> 27:44.879
- So, I'll see you later.
- Wait.

27:45.287 --> 27:46.436
Look.

27:47.456 --> 27:51.376
I know I made a mistake once,
but I'm a different person now.

27:53.251 --> 27:55.790
- I tried therapy.
- Yeah?

27:56.407 --> 27:58.967
- How many times did you go?
- Twice.

28:00.135 --> 28:01.136
Right.

28:10.604 --> 28:11.813
I've missed you.

28:14.191 --> 28:15.441
I've missed you, too.

28:15.718 --> 28:17.485
Can we start over?

28:17.486 --> 28:19.132
I wanna see you again.

28:19.488 --> 28:21.322
Well, didn't Nina tell you?

28:21.323 --> 28:22.875
I got a part in "Locked."

28:23.617 --> 28:26.078
Didn't know it came
with fringe benefits.

28:36.973 --> 28:38.251
Hiding out?

28:38.507 --> 28:40.883
You never did like
an industry party.

28:40.884 --> 28:42.886
I just don't want another
scene with Rainer.

28:44.304 --> 28:46.395
I, I haven't heard
from you in a while.

28:46.557 --> 28:48.403
Yeah, it's really crazy lately.

28:49.059 --> 28:52.521
It's not right what they're
doing to you because of... us.

28:53.897 --> 28:55.089
I'm sorry.

28:55.983 --> 28:57.687
I'm not.

28:58.485 --> 29:00.903
I mean, the tabloids,
tabloids blow.

29:00.904 --> 29:04.950
But, being with you?
It was worth it.

29:13.333 --> 29:15.334
- Am I interrupting round two?
- Hold on, Rainer.

29:15.335 --> 29:17.169
Look, Tangey and I made a mistake.
A big one.

29:17.170 --> 29:18.921
- And I'm sorry for that.
- You're damn right about that.

29:18.922 --> 29:20.506
'We're all gonna be working
on this movie together'

29:20.507 --> 29:22.091
whether you like it or
not, so get over yourself

29:22.092 --> 29:23.551
and quit being a little bitch.

29:23.552 --> 29:25.761
- You wanna do this again?
- Look, step back, man.

29:25.762 --> 29:28.347
- You need to step back.
- Hey. Hey, that is enough!

29:28.348 --> 29:29.890
That is enough!

29:29.891 --> 29:31.767
You're not goin' to ruin tonight.
Do you hear me?

29:31.768 --> 29:33.728
You have jobs to do out there.

29:33.729 --> 29:36.647
'So get it together.
Here's the story.'

29:36.648 --> 29:38.899
You and Tangey amicably
broke up a month ago

29:38.900 --> 29:41.450
'and chose to keep your
private lives private.'

29:41.695 --> 29:43.195
And nothing happened
between you and Tangey.

29:43.196 --> 29:44.779
'It was an absurd rumor.'

29:45.198 --> 29:47.354
You were all friends before

29:47.659 --> 29:49.619
'and you're still friends now.'

29:49.620 --> 29:50.692
Got it?

29:52.122 --> 29:54.790
Okay, everybody,
let's put on a show.

29:54.791 --> 29:55.792
Come on.

29:57.419 --> 30:00.129
And you need to stop
believing your own press.

30:00.130 --> 30:01.130
What?

30:01.131 --> 30:03.090
You may be America's
favorite good guy

30:03.091 --> 30:05.384
but I know you sleep with a
different girl every night.

30:05.385 --> 30:08.263
So, stop pretending that
Tangey meant something to you.

30:09.473 --> 30:10.557
Thanks, mom.

30:15.312 --> 30:16.979
- 'Tangey, who are you wearing?'
- 'What about the album?'

30:16.980 --> 30:18.189
- 'When does it come out?'
- 'Tangey?'

30:18.190 --> 30:20.483
- 'Can we get any quotes...'
- 'Tangey.'

30:20.484 --> 30:24.737
Ladies and gentlemen, please
welcome Hollywood heartthrobs

30:24.738 --> 30:27.740
Rainer Devon as Noah Greer.

30:27.741 --> 30:30.701
And Jordan Wilder as Ed Khan.

30:32.454 --> 30:35.247
You may have conned my mom
into giving you this role

30:35.248 --> 30:36.957
but don't think we're good.

30:36.958 --> 30:39.168
I didn't have to con
her into anything.

30:39.169 --> 30:42.172
I got this part based on
my talent, not nepotism.

30:47.469 --> 30:49.804
Next, we have
America's sweetheart

30:49.805 --> 30:52.014
Alexis Glenn as Maggie.

30:53.892 --> 30:57.883
'And Broadway sensation
Rachel Davis as Layla.'

30:58.647 --> 31:01.774
'Finally, there's a new face in
Hollywood I'd like you to meet.'

31:01.775 --> 31:03.859
After a nationwide talent search

31:03.860 --> 31:06.987
'playing our heroine,
August Roch'

31:06.988 --> 31:10.324
introducing, Paige Townsen!

31:11.827 --> 31:14.495
- Whoo!
- Go, Paige!

31:17.708 --> 31:20.751
'Paige, look this way.
Paige, this way.'

31:20.752 --> 31:23.713
'Look this way, Paige.
Hey, over here.'

31:23.714 --> 31:25.005
'Paige, what's it feel like to'

31:25.006 --> 31:27.591
'work with the hottest
men in Hollywood?'

31:27.592 --> 31:29.927
'Over here, are you
dating anybody?'

31:29.928 --> 31:32.138
Paige, where have
you been hiding?

31:32.139 --> 31:34.056
Uh, uh, nowhere.

31:34.057 --> 31:36.074
Have we seen you
anywhere before?

31:36.852 --> 31:39.770
Um, maybe at the CMU quad.

31:53.744 --> 31:55.202
Hey, take it easy, fellas.

31:55.203 --> 31:56.787
Her studio insurance
policy doesn't kick in

31:56.788 --> 31:58.247
until we start shooting.

32:02.002 --> 32:05.588
Ladies and gentlemen, I give
you the cast of "Locked!"

32:21.239 --> 32:23.032
Hey, it's 8:00 o'clock.
Have you seen Paige?

32:23.033 --> 32:25.076
Uh, not since the announcement.

32:25.077 --> 32:26.202
What are those?

32:26.203 --> 32:27.536
They're like the
Swedish meatballs

32:27.537 --> 32:29.247
but more Mexican than Swedish.

32:33.877 --> 32:35.420
Um, I gotta go pee.

32:38.173 --> 32:39.927
- Hi.
- Oh.

32:40.634 --> 32:41.842
Hi, a-aren't you, uh...

32:41.843 --> 32:44.443
America's sweetheart? Guilty.

32:45.138 --> 32:48.015
Did I see you arrive earlier
with Paige Townsen?

32:48.016 --> 32:50.351
Yeah, yeah. Yeah, we're,
uh, we're good friends.

32:50.352 --> 32:53.348
Well, any friend of Paige's
is a friend of mine.

32:53.814 --> 32:55.627
Yeah, totally. I...

32:57.317 --> 32:59.620
Especially one with
those big brown eyes.

33:01.763 --> 33:03.115
Guilty.

33:06.920 --> 33:08.632
Reach out to all of them, Todd.

33:08.657 --> 33:10.909
God, the new studio
head decides my fate.

33:12.165 --> 33:13.997
Earn your commission for once.

33:16.378 --> 33:19.373
- Having fun?
- Not really.

33:19.589 --> 33:21.841
Tangey should have been
photographed with the cast.

33:21.842 --> 33:23.009
Why?

33:23.010 --> 33:24.051
You can't become a triple threat

33:24.052 --> 33:25.511
if all you do is sing.

33:25.512 --> 33:27.013
- The movie's cast.
- Oh.

33:27.014 --> 33:29.322
Then we don't have a
deal on the soundtrack.

33:29.323 --> 33:30.781
- Seriously?
- Mm.

33:30.782 --> 33:32.658
Have a little gratitude.

33:32.659 --> 33:34.285
Another PR mishap like her last

33:34.286 --> 33:36.651
she'll be lucky if they
let her sing at the mall.

33:38.010 --> 33:39.386
Enjoy the party.

33:46.173 --> 33:48.175
Hey. Nice seeing you.

33:50.370 --> 33:53.721
Brody, hi. Look, nobody
here knows that I...

33:53.722 --> 33:56.974
- Hey, I'm Jake.
- Hi. Brody.

33:56.975 --> 33:58.517
- So are you a client of...
- Oh, my God!

33:58.518 --> 34:00.931
- It's Selena Gomez!
- Where?

34:01.521 --> 34:03.200
Over there!

34:04.015 --> 34:06.433
No. No, th-that's
not Selena Gomez.

34:06.497 --> 34:07.998
Oh. My bad.

34:13.159 --> 34:15.829
- Who are we looking for?
- Uh, no one.

34:18.039 --> 34:21.041
Yuck! Can you believe her
with that goofy grin?

34:21.125 --> 34:22.793
Those have to be veneers, right?

34:26.292 --> 34:28.018
Why do we hate her again?

34:28.422 --> 34:30.255
Oh, thank goodness,
you guys are here.

34:30.280 --> 34:32.677
Let's bounce outta here.
Well, we really need...

34:32.678 --> 34:34.428
You're not done yet. You
haven't met Barrett Hopper.

34:34.429 --> 34:35.888
Oh, but, uh, Nina, I should...

34:35.889 --> 34:38.474
- I, uh, I really have to leave.
- What?

34:38.475 --> 34:39.725
'Uh, we were just
on our way out.'

34:39.726 --> 34:40.851
Uh, Paige's parents are in town.
So we...

34:40.851 --> 34:42.561
- And who are you?
- Oh, I'm Jake Salt.

34:42.562 --> 34:45.523
- I'm Paige's friend.
- That was rhetorical.

34:46.003 --> 34:48.567
This is part of your job, Paige.
Your parents can wait.

34:48.568 --> 34:50.110
- But, Nina, I...
- 'Let's go.'

34:50.112 --> 34:51.487
Do you want us to call your mom?

34:51.487 --> 34:53.280
- 'Paige?'
- Uh, uh...

34:53.281 --> 34:54.739
I'll shoot Mrs. T another text

34:54.741 --> 34:56.645
while we Uber it at
the shake stand.

34:57.356 --> 34:58.744
Wait, what, you're still hungry?

34:58.745 --> 35:00.246
- Barrett...
- Hi.

35:00.247 --> 35:01.455
It's my pleasure
to introduce you

35:01.456 --> 35:02.873
to the star of our little movie.

35:02.874 --> 35:05.068
That hair could be
a star on its own.

35:05.263 --> 35:08.045
Well, darling, aren't you
the talk of the town?

35:08.450 --> 35:10.798
Talk to Barrett. Tell
us your life story.

35:18.398 --> 35:20.057
Sorry, I couldn't get you
out of there in time

35:20.058 --> 35:21.461
to talk to your dad.

35:24.083 --> 35:26.625
I'm sorry you and Jordan
are still fighting.

35:28.186 --> 35:30.568
I guess what Nina said
about him and Tangey

35:30.569 --> 35:33.013
wasn't just a rumor.

35:35.286 --> 35:36.704
It's history.

35:39.207 --> 35:40.619
You seem to have
a lot of history

35:40.620 --> 35:43.463
with a lot of different people.

35:46.721 --> 35:48.587
Well, not that many, a few.

35:50.756 --> 35:51.922
Okay, quite a few.

35:53.175 --> 35:55.870
Did Jake and Cassie have fun?

35:56.320 --> 35:57.725
They make a cute couple.

35:58.701 --> 36:01.099
They're not dating.

36:01.172 --> 36:03.318
Actually we're all kinda just...

36:04.474 --> 36:05.600
friends.

36:06.153 --> 36:07.237
Good to know.

36:10.139 --> 36:12.065
I've never met anyone
quite like you.

36:14.313 --> 36:15.447
Me, too.

36:20.412 --> 36:22.982
I-I'm sorry, honey. Dad
saw you on the news.

36:24.790 --> 36:26.124
Hi, Rainer.

36:28.835 --> 36:29.835
Sorry.

36:33.370 --> 36:35.580
How could you lie like this, hm?

36:35.581 --> 36:37.582
And then make your mother
do your dirty work.

36:37.583 --> 36:39.000
I-I don't even know who
you are right now.

36:39.001 --> 36:40.256
I'm sorry.

36:40.920 --> 36:43.191
I was going to
tell you, I swear.

36:43.437 --> 36:45.897
You are throwing
away your education

36:46.008 --> 36:48.635
to star in some
Hollywood movie...

36:48.636 --> 36:51.262
I told you, this film
is a really big deal.

36:51.263 --> 36:53.222
And I'm not throwing
away my education.

36:53.223 --> 36:54.933
I-I found a way to make it work.

36:54.934 --> 36:56.559
Yeah, that's right, because
you're gonna quit.

36:56.560 --> 36:58.186
- What?
- Yes.

36:58.187 --> 37:01.606
I-I can't. I, I already
made a commitment.

37:01.607 --> 37:03.483
Well, you tell them you
changed your mind.

37:03.484 --> 37:04.526
No!

37:06.528 --> 37:07.529
I...

37:09.657 --> 37:11.053
I won't.

37:12.487 --> 37:13.743
Yes, you taught me

37:13.744 --> 37:15.787
the importance of
an education, dad.

37:15.788 --> 37:17.538
But you also taught me

37:17.539 --> 37:19.624
how, how important it is

37:19.625 --> 37:21.228
to dream big.

37:22.503 --> 37:26.340
And, I mean, this is as
big as my dreams get.

37:27.925 --> 37:28.926
I'm...

37:32.304 --> 37:33.472
I'm doing the movie.

37:41.396 --> 37:42.397
I see.

37:43.832 --> 37:45.097
Dad.

37:56.673 --> 37:58.716
He knows you get paid a lot
for this, though, right?

37:58.789 --> 37:59.831
It doesn't matter.

37:59.832 --> 38:01.749
He's worried I'm not
gonna be able to handle

38:01.750 --> 38:03.595
doing school and the movie.

38:03.919 --> 38:05.879
I'm starting to
think he's right.

38:08.757 --> 38:10.759
Cassie brought some dessert
home in her purse.

38:12.594 --> 38:13.595
You want a cookie?

38:16.265 --> 38:17.591
What kind of cookie?

38:18.225 --> 38:19.309
I'll go get 'em.

38:20.686 --> 38:21.748
I'll make some tea.

38:29.319 --> 38:30.903

Probably picking up your
Boniva prescription.

39:08.650 --> 39:10.693
- Do I need to call security?
- Sure.

39:10.694 --> 39:13.227
Tell them your new boss is here.

39:14.198 --> 39:15.198
- What?
- Oh.

39:15.199 --> 39:17.677
I'm the new head of
Gold Brothers, Nina.

39:18.368 --> 39:20.644
And I'm gonna have a lot of fun

39:21.246 --> 39:24.917
making your life a living hell.

39:29.296 --> 39:30.914
Glad we could work this out.

39:31.465 --> 39:33.845
Remember, we agreed
on $50 more bucks.

39:34.468 --> 39:36.212
I need the money for school.

since last night.

40:34.778 --> 40:37.876
Dad, I really don't want
you to go home mad at me.

40:38.657 --> 40:39.907
I would like to say I'm not mad.

40:39.908 --> 40:42.118
I'm disappointed, but
that would be a lie.

40:42.119 --> 40:43.744
'Something you seem
to know a lot about.'

40:44.746 --> 40:46.957
Uh, uh, excuse me?

40:47.738 --> 40:49.497
Oh, my God, you're her.

40:49.793 --> 40:51.886
Hey, can I, can I
have your autograph?

40:52.379 --> 40:54.409
Uh, um, really?

40:54.965 --> 40:57.049
I can't believe I'm
meeting Paige Townsen.

40:57.050 --> 40:59.056
Uh, can you make it
out to Jennifer?

40:59.553 --> 41:02.763
Yeah. Yeah, yeah,
of course, I can.

41:02.764 --> 41:05.308
I've read "Locked" six times.

41:05.309 --> 41:07.226
August is my favorite
character of all time.

41:07.227 --> 41:09.395
I wrote a paper on her
for my English class.

41:09.396 --> 41:12.273
- What grade did you get?
- A plus.

41:12.931 --> 41:14.358
Congratulations.

41:14.359 --> 41:16.110
- Thanks.
- 'Here you go.'

41:16.111 --> 41:18.029
- Thanks so much, Jennifer.
- 'Oh, my God!'

41:18.030 --> 41:20.364
Thank you. Oh, my God!

41:20.365 --> 41:23.951
Hey, Paige, this is incredible.
You're famous already.

41:36.506 --> 41:39.008
Okay, y-you're sure you
can make this movie

41:39.009 --> 41:40.597
'and stay at school?'

41:41.094 --> 41:44.396
I promise I'm gonna do
whatever it takes to do both.

41:46.683 --> 41:48.059
Well, I'm not sure it's doable

41:48.060 --> 41:50.937
but I guess I could
make up a spreadsheet

41:50.938 --> 41:52.348
to help you with your schedule.

41:53.565 --> 41:55.170
I would love that, dad.

41:55.434 --> 41:58.093
Okay, so what's this "Locked" story about?
What is this?
