00:31.958 --> 00:33.666
So, what do you think?

00:33.666 --> 00:38.208
Maury, I think it's a perfect way
to catch people up from last season,

00:38.208 --> 00:42.541
and the perfect montage
to show at Montel's Jizz Mitzvah.

00:42.541 --> 00:45.291
Well, I am quite taken
with my own handiwork.

00:45.291 --> 00:47.291
Oh! Speaking of handiwork...

00:47.291 --> 00:49.875
...we should offer handies
at the Jizz Mitzvah.

00:49.875 --> 00:52.625
"Hire handyman to give hand jobs."

00:52.625 --> 00:54.666
I can't believe our sweet Montel

00:54.666 --> 00:58.250
is officially joining
the Hormone Monster community.

00:58.250 --> 01:01.291
It feels like just yesterday
they shot out of my asshole

01:01.291 --> 01:02.583
and into our lives.

01:02.583 --> 01:03.708
Ugh, so true.

01:03.708 --> 01:08.250
Oh, not to be dramatic, but if everything
in this ceremony doesn't go perfectly,

01:08.250 --> 01:11.083
I'll light my apartment on fire
while we're all inside.

01:11.083 --> 01:13.083
Maury, will you try to relax?

01:13.083 --> 01:14.416
"Relax"?

01:14.416 --> 01:16.958
I still have to lock down
the dick-pic photo booth.

01:16.958 --> 01:20.916
I haven't even confirmed the ice sculpture
depicting Montel's conception.

01:20.916 --> 01:25.041
Okay, but let's not forget
the true meaning of this Jizz Mitzvah.

01:25.041 --> 01:28.333
Montel jacking off on stage
behind a sheer curtain

01:28.333 --> 01:30.875
while we all wait for ejaculation.

01:30.875 --> 01:34.125
Ooh! Which of these gimp suits
should I wear on the big day?

01:34.125 --> 01:36.125
Should I showcase my arms or my balls?

01:36.125 --> 01:39.375
Oh God, not more of this garbage.

01:39.375 --> 01:42.166
But it's all for <i>you</i>, my sweet baby!

01:42.166 --> 01:43.916
For me? Oh, please!

01:43.916 --> 01:46.166
I'm just there to put on
a little jack-off show

01:46.166 --> 01:48.458
for your friends
and a couple elected officials.

01:48.458 --> 01:52.250
Montel, have you been using the sheet
I put up for stroke practice?

01:52.250 --> 01:57.166
I don't need to practice.
I already know how to whack off. Gawd-ah!

01:57.166 --> 01:59.708
But you've never done it
in front of everyone who loves you.

01:59.708 --> 02:01.000
You might get stage fright.

02:01.000 --> 02:03.875
Yeah, like your father
at his Jizz Mitzvah.

02:03.875 --> 02:06.416
- Connie!
- What? That's what happened, right?

02:06.416 --> 02:08.750
Yeah, but <i>they</i> don't need to know that!

02:08.750 --> 02:11.333

02:44.541 --> 02:46.875
I know, Lucinda, and I am so sorry.

02:46.875 --> 02:48.958
I've got two clients named Lucinda,

02:48.958 --> 02:52.541
and I thought you were Lucinda P,
but you're Lucinda B,

02:52.541 --> 02:55.833
and that's why you acted
so inappropriately with your boss.

02:55.833 --> 02:59.291
Because Lucinda P <i>is</i> fucking her boss,

02:59.291 --> 03:03.041
and I know it's toxic,
but love is love, right?

03:03.583 --> 03:04.583
Hello?

03:05.166 --> 03:06.208
Hello?

03:06.208 --> 03:08.583
Well, I've lost another one.

03:08.583 --> 03:10.833
Mmm, see, Emmy, this is why I keep

03:10.833 --> 03:13.666
both paper and digital folders
for each of my clients.

03:13.666 --> 03:16.083
Color-coded, of course,
so that I never mix them up.

03:16.083 --> 03:19.250
Pete, I'm not you.
I'm not meant to be good at my job.

03:19.250 --> 03:21.625
Labor does not agree with me.

03:21.625 --> 03:24.500
When will my life get fun again?

03:24.500 --> 03:28.041
- Well, I think work <i>can</i> be fun.
- Oh, Pete, honey.

03:28.041 --> 03:30.041
You have no idea how to be fun.

03:30.041 --> 03:32.250
Yes, I do. Look at my mug.

03:32.250 --> 03:34.041
 "Don't Vark Too Aard"?

03:34.041 --> 03:37.416
It's an aardvark in a...
...in a suit, like a businessman.

03:39.041 --> 03:42.083
Oh, God, another client?

03:42.083 --> 03:45.000
"Sarah K. Twenty-eight. Clinton Hill"?

03:46.166 --> 03:49.375
I'm gonna go sit on the toilet
and pretend to poop to avoid working.

03:49.375 --> 03:52.791
Also, one time I hit a beach ball
at a sporting event.

03:52.791 --> 03:54.208
I'm very fun!

03:54.208 --> 03:57.541
I think you're fun, Pete.
I saw you eat a frozen banana yesterday.

03:57.541 --> 04:00.666
- I know. It's almost like ice cream.
- Oh, Pete.

04:00.666 --> 04:01.625
Ahh!

04:01.625 --> 04:06.125
Rochelle, you lovable, fuckable,
buggable girlfriend of mine.

04:06.125 --> 04:08.791
Dante, is this charcuterie basket for me?

04:08.791 --> 04:10.083
I may have lost my meat,

04:10.083 --> 04:13.125
but I've still got cheddar
to spend on my girl.

04:13.125 --> 04:16.625
- Hold this for me, chief.
- Oh, uh... Oh, okay.

04:18.583 --> 04:21.125
Um, uh, yeah, I actually just remembered

04:21.125 --> 04:25.458
I have to conduct business here
at my work desk.

04:26.041 --> 04:29.541
Wow, a full meat basket?
That is love, Gil.

04:29.541 --> 04:32.291
Hey, Joe, why don't you ever buy me
a meat basket?

04:32.291 --> 04:35.458
Come on, Gilly, you know I love you.

04:35.458 --> 04:37.708
Well, say it with mortadella, please.

04:38.666 --> 04:41.000
I miss you even when I'm with you, babe.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.750
- God, I know.
- Mm!

04:42.750 --> 04:44.666
Let's sneak
to the bathroom together, yeah?

04:44.666 --> 04:46.916
Ugh, I wish I could, but I have work.

04:46.916 --> 04:48.583
I'll just get under the desk then, yeah?

04:48.583 --> 04:50.500
I have to taste you, babe,
or I'll go mental.

04:50.500 --> 04:53.208
Dante! In the office?

04:53.208 --> 04:56.791
- Uh, you guys aren't actually gonna...?
- Oh, yes. We are.

04:56.791 --> 04:58.208
Okay, um...

04:58.208 --> 05:01.833
I'm just gonna go sit on the toilet
and pretend to have a bowel movement.

05:01.833 --> 05:03.833
- This is so inappropriate.
- Mm!

05:03.833 --> 05:05.958
Aww, look at those two.

05:05.958 --> 05:08.083
They can't keep their hands
off each other.

05:08.083 --> 05:10.791
- I know. It's disgusting.
- It's sweet.

05:10.791 --> 05:12.666
You know I love love.

05:12.666 --> 05:15.875
He's giving her oral pleasures
under her desk, Walter.

05:15.875 --> 05:18.416
Ew! Can't you just call it
something normal?

05:18.416 --> 05:19.333
Yeah, whatever.

05:19.333 --> 05:23.041
- Cunnilingus isn't what I'm interested in.
- I am.

05:23.041 --> 05:25.291
There's something weird going on
with those two dudes.

05:25.291 --> 05:28.625
- Is there?
- You noticed Dante seems to hate Pete?

05:28.625 --> 05:31.791
Well, he <i>did</i> cut off Dante's dick.

05:31.791 --> 05:34.041
Nah, the guy had three dicks,

05:34.041 --> 05:36.250
and Pete saved his life.
It's more than that.

05:36.250 --> 05:39.083
You don't think
you should just mind your own business

05:39.083 --> 05:41.125
and respect their privacy?

05:43.708 --> 05:44.875
I'm just kidding.

05:44.875 --> 05:45.958
We're coworkers.

05:45.958 --> 05:49.500
- Their business is our business.
- You right.

05:50.166 --> 05:53.958
- Maury, baby, you need to calm down.
-"Calm down"?

05:53.958 --> 05:55.583
If I don't get Wolfbang Fuck

05:55.583 --> 05:57.791
to do the passed apps
for this Jizz Mitzvah,

05:57.791 --> 05:59.833
I'm going to freak out.

05:59.833 --> 06:03.500
Oh! The preparations are underway, I see.

06:03.500 --> 06:05.958
- I look forward to the big day.
- What'd you just say?

06:05.958 --> 06:10.916
I even bought a sexy new fashion belt
from a mean teenager at Hot Topic.

06:10.916 --> 06:12.250
Why you buying belts?

06:12.250 --> 06:15.375
- Why, for the Jizz Mitzvah, of course.
- Hey! How do you know about that?

06:15.375 --> 06:17.750
And Maury, look at you.

06:17.750 --> 06:20.375
Making your baby body a forever body.

06:20.375 --> 06:21.916
Very brave.

06:21.916 --> 06:24.583
- Maury, did you invite him?
- Of course not.

06:24.583 --> 06:28.041
We went to great lengths
to invite everyone in the office <i>but</i> him.

06:28.041 --> 06:29.625
Well, he cannot come.

06:29.625 --> 06:32.625
This is an event
that should be totally free of shame.

06:32.625 --> 06:34.791
Yeah, he'll just make people feel bad

06:34.791 --> 06:36.875
for watching our offspring
squirt their nut.

06:36.875 --> 06:41.000
Exactly. Let's go tell him
to shove his new belt up his ancient anus.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.000
Yeah, buckle first.

06:43.708 --> 06:47.833
Okay, Sarah K. Please be an easy one.
Mama needs a win.

06:47.833 --> 06:52.250
Thanks, Raoul. Put it on my tab
and give yourself a nice fat tip.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.708
- You are a prince among men.
- Mmm.

06:54.708 --> 06:57.916
Okay. Nice to bartenders. She seems cool.

06:57.916 --> 07:00.958
Hey, Sarah, I'm Emmy, your new Lovebug,

07:00.958 --> 07:03.333
and possibly your new best friend.

07:03.333 --> 07:04.458
Oh. Okay.

07:04.458 --> 07:07.041
So, uh, what are you loving these days?

07:07.041 --> 07:09.833
Boys? Girls? Cold, hard cash?

07:09.833 --> 07:13.125
Well, I dunno.
I guess I'm just lovin' life.

07:13.125 --> 07:17.166
All right. No red flags here.
Mind if I, uh, pull up a stool?

07:17.166 --> 07:19.333
- Well, well, well.
- Wow.

07:19.333 --> 07:21.708
Who's this cute little bumblebee?

07:21.708 --> 07:22.958
Who are you?

07:22.958 --> 07:26.083
- I'm Van, Sarah's Logic Rock.
- Cool.

07:26.083 --> 07:29.041
And now it's your turn, girly.
Who are you?

07:29.041 --> 07:31.958
Oh, I'm, uh, Emmy, her new Lovebug.

07:31.958 --> 07:34.208
I see. Fuck right off, Emmy.

07:34.208 --> 07:36.250
Cool. Wait, wait, what?

07:36.250 --> 07:40.083
Nothing personal.
We're just not big on love. Right, Sarah?

07:40.083 --> 07:43.083
- Yeah, love's so complicated and messy.
- Oh...

07:43.083 --> 07:46.125
And these humans,
they're only alive for, like, what?

07:46.125 --> 07:48.875
- Eighty, ninety years?
- Sometimes less.

07:48.875 --> 07:54.125
So, honey, my philosophy is
maximize pleasure, minimize pain.

07:54.125 --> 07:55.916
No, no! Hold-- Hold on.

07:55.916 --> 07:59.541
Pleasure's actually my whole thing.
It's kinda all I care about.

07:59.541 --> 08:03.291
Come on, Van. Let her stick around.
It's Tipsy Tuesday.

08:03.291 --> 08:07.583
I'm fun, I promise.
So fun, I didn't even know it was Tuesday.

08:07.583 --> 08:10.750
All right, but you gotta catch up
and keep up.

08:13.833 --> 08:15.250
Told you I was fun.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.041
I'm actua... I'm good.

08:19.166 --> 08:22.208
All right, lightning round.
Greatest shame. Kitty.

08:22.208 --> 08:24.833
Ooh! She secretly loves <i>Ted Lasso.</i>

08:24.833 --> 08:26.041
Correct.

08:26.041 --> 08:29.291
Montel, what the hell are you doin'
with the Shame Wizard?

08:29.291 --> 08:32.291
Please tell me you two
are planning a terrorist attack.

08:32.291 --> 08:34.375
- Lionel's been mentoring me.
- Exsquirt me?

08:34.375 --> 08:38.750
Montel is quite gifted
at pinpointing one's greatest shame.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.041
Observe. Gil.

08:40.041 --> 08:43.083
Ooh! Thinks about Joe
when he's making love to his wife.

08:43.083 --> 08:44.541
Indeed. Joe.

08:44.541 --> 08:46.916
Thinks about his wife
when he's making love to Gil.

08:46.916 --> 08:48.750
Brilliant! Maury.

08:48.750 --> 08:50.125
Everyone loves Connie more.

08:50.125 --> 08:52.625
He'll always live in the shadow
of her fabulousness.

08:52.625 --> 08:53.958
- Hey! How dare you!
- Ahh!

08:53.958 --> 08:55.791
I mean, that is very insightful.

08:55.791 --> 08:57.291
No, it's not. Not insightful.

08:57.291 --> 09:00.666
Montel, why are you doing
all of this bullshit

09:00.666 --> 09:02.875
instead of preparing
for your Jizz Mitzvah?

09:02.875 --> 09:07.416
Because, Mama Maury, I've been thinking,
and... [sighs] ...I don't want a Jizz Mitzvah.

09:07.416 --> 09:09.416
But my big binder.

09:09.416 --> 09:13.125
Baby, your father's been going overboard
with the whole event--

09:13.125 --> 09:14.708
Shut the door. I'm burning us alive.

09:14.708 --> 09:17.541
We can make it smaller, more intimate--

09:17.541 --> 09:21.416
You don't get it.
I don't want any kind of Jizz Mitzvah.

09:21.416 --> 09:24.125
But, sweetie,
how will you be ritually welcomed

09:24.125 --> 09:26.833
into the community of Hormone Monsters?

09:26.833 --> 09:29.041
Well, that's just the thing.

09:29.041 --> 09:31.500
I don't want to be a Hormone Monster.

09:31.500 --> 09:33.541
- What?!
- Oh, God!

09:33.541 --> 09:37.833
Maury, you were right the whole time.
I wanna do the burning family thing.

09:37.833 --> 09:41.416
Oh, I wanna roast from the inside out.

09:41.416 --> 09:43.833
Oh, me too.

09:44.458 --> 09:46.875
That actually went better
than I thought it would.

09:46.875 --> 09:49.208
Yes, but my office is burning.

09:51.750 --> 09:55.083
Guys, if I don't pee right now,
I'll fucking die.

09:55.083 --> 09:58.416
It's gonna absorb into my bloodstream
and give me tinkle brain.

09:58.416 --> 10:01.708
- One of my mom's friends died from that.
- We'll just go in the dudes' room.

10:02.875 --> 10:04.416
Uh, oh, my God.

10:04.416 --> 10:07.291
How the hell do this many guys
have to take a dump at once?

10:07.291 --> 10:10.541
- Ooh, what if we tried a urinal?
- Good call. Grab the middle one.

10:10.541 --> 10:13.250
So, do I, like, mount it straight on?

10:13.250 --> 10:15.541
- Nope, nope, nope, nope.
- Backwards. Definitely backwards.

10:15.541 --> 10:17.416
- Oof, if you pee on me...
- Ohhh.

10:17.416 --> 10:19.708
Sweet mother
of all that is bright and shiny,

10:19.708 --> 10:22.375
that feels so good.

10:22.375 --> 10:24.666
Oh, uh...

10:24.666 --> 10:26.458
- Hi?
- Uh, ahoy.

10:26.458 --> 10:28.333
I'm sorry. A-- Am I in the wrong, uh...

10:28.333 --> 10:31.208
Nope. Welcome to the men's room.

10:31.208 --> 10:34.750
Well, thank you
for being such a nice host.

10:34.750 --> 10:36.458
- Aww, this guy's cute.
- Ooh!

10:36.458 --> 10:40.250
I-I'd love to let you finish,
but I've really gotta pee.

10:40.250 --> 10:42.750
Nah, don't be silly, big dawg.

10:42.750 --> 10:44.791
Unzip. Unfurl.

10:44.791 --> 10:48.875
Okay, "big dawg" is, uh, unfurling...

10:48.875 --> 10:50.250
Woo!

10:50.250 --> 10:52.041
Don't look, if you don't mind.

10:52.041 --> 10:54.916
Don't wanna look
if you don't want me to look.

10:54.916 --> 10:56.666
That means
there's nothing worth looking at.

10:56.666 --> 10:58.291
That's not what I'm-- You know what?

10:58.291 --> 11:01.541
As a rule, we typically don't talk
to each other in the men's room.

11:04.375 --> 11:05.750
What? I'm not talking.

11:05.750 --> 11:09.791
- Okay, but now you are, actually.
- Yeah, because you looked at me.

11:09.791 --> 11:12.750
Hey, can you guys flirt
somewhere else? I'm trying to focus.

11:12.750 --> 11:15.666
- No, we're not flirting.
- Yes, we are.

11:15.666 --> 11:17.958
Oh! Okay. Very cool.

11:17.958 --> 11:21.750
Sarah, I peeked at his penis,
and it's a good one.

11:23.875 --> 11:27.458
Wow, an impromptu invite
to drinks with co-workers.

11:27.458 --> 11:30.333
Sounds like something
that would happen to a fun individual.

11:30.333 --> 11:33.250
- Pete, that jacket.
- Fun, right?

11:33.250 --> 11:36.875
- I was gonna say deeply upsetting.
- All right. Enough chitchat.

11:36.875 --> 11:39.791
Pete, what the fuck's goin' on
with you and Dante?

11:39.791 --> 11:41.000
Me and Dante?

11:41.000 --> 11:44.375
Boo-boo, it's obvious
he hates your rock-hard guts.

11:44.375 --> 11:48.958
We just wanna know why,
you sweet, beautiful baby boulder.

11:48.958 --> 11:50.500
The hell are you doing?

11:50.500 --> 11:53.916
I thought we'd play
a little bad cop, fab cop.

11:53.916 --> 11:55.083
I fuckin' love it.

11:55.083 --> 11:57.291
Now, tell us what else you did to Dante

11:57.291 --> 11:59.791
or I'll pull your heart
outta your asshole!

11:59.791 --> 12:01.291
Wha-- Nothing, I swear.

12:01.291 --> 12:05.125
Petra, be nice to my pretty little pebble.

12:05.125 --> 12:09.666
- Pebble, spill the tea. Mwah.
- What is happening?

12:09.666 --> 12:11.625
What'd you do, huh? Fuck his sister?

12:11.625 --> 12:13.250
- No, his mother?
- What?

12:13.250 --> 12:15.791
Why'd you fuck his mother
in front of his father?

12:15.791 --> 12:19.166
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Nothing. He's perfect.

12:19.166 --> 12:21.500
We're gonna open a restaurant together.

12:22.541 --> 12:25.583
Stop yelling at me
and kissing my forehead.

12:25.583 --> 12:29.041
Dante is only mad at me
because I had to slowly cut off his penis.

12:29.041 --> 12:30.958
Hey, guys.

12:30.958 --> 12:32.958
- Nice jacket, mate.
- Oh, thank you...?

12:32.958 --> 12:35.208
What'd you skin Barney the dino
for that thing?

12:35.208 --> 12:37.041
- Shut up.
- Fuckin' hideous.

12:37.041 --> 12:39.291
- I got him that jacket.
- You did?

12:39.291 --> 12:40.708
Pete, you look great.

12:40.708 --> 12:42.541
Oh, I do?

12:42.541 --> 12:45.958
Uh, I-I mean, who cares what you think.
Not me.

12:45.958 --> 12:47.000
Bullshit.

12:47.000 --> 12:49.250
I bet you prance
around your apartment in it,

12:49.250 --> 12:51.291
calling yourself "Mr. Rochelle."

12:51.291 --> 12:53.250
Come on, Dante, leave him alone.

12:53.250 --> 12:56.208
Holy shit, <i>that's</i> why Dante hates you.

12:56.208 --> 12:58.125
You got a thing for Rochelle!

12:58.125 --> 12:59.375
No, I don't.

12:59.375 --> 13:02.375
That's why he wears
the deeply upsetting jacket.

13:02.375 --> 13:05.291
- Just shut, shut, shut it.
- Oh, we're good.

13:05.291 --> 13:06.958
Wow, wow, wow, wow. Okay.

13:06.958 --> 13:10.833
So you got the hots for Dante's girl,
and then you cut off his dick?

13:10.833 --> 13:12.791
You're an evil genius.

13:12.791 --> 13:14.416
No, I <i>had</i> to cut it off.

13:14.416 --> 13:18.416
Of course you did, Pebble.
Only two more to go.

13:21.875 --> 13:25.666
Can I ask, are you washing your hands
because you got pee on them

13:25.666 --> 13:27.583
or because you have a filthy penis?

13:27.583 --> 13:31.166
Oh, this is actually the first time
I've ever washed my hands.

13:31.166 --> 13:33.375
I just wanted
to keep this weird hang going.

13:33.375 --> 13:35.125
Ew. But aww.

13:35.125 --> 13:39.041
I know, right? Meet-cute in the potty?
Who'd have thought?

13:39.041 --> 13:41.750
Okay, keep your little glow
in your pants, Emmy.

13:41.750 --> 13:42.708
Here it comes.

13:42.708 --> 13:46.958
"Logically, you shouldn't
be picking up guys in bar bathrooms."

13:46.958 --> 13:48.500
I don't sound like that.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.166
And logically,
now that you've seen his penis,

13:51.166 --> 13:53.458
you should find out
what that sucker tastes like.

13:53.458 --> 13:56.291
Huh! What <i>does</i> a human penis taste like?

13:56.291 --> 14:00.125
Mmm, it's nothing to write home about.
At best, it tastes like soap.

14:00.125 --> 14:04.666
Actually, at best,
it tastes like <i>you</i>, darling.

14:04.666 --> 14:07.708
Hey, babe. All right, all right,
let's fuck the urinal guy.

14:07.708 --> 14:10.458
Ready? On three. One, two, three...

14:10.458 --> 14:13.291
Let's fuck the urinal guy!

14:14.208 --> 14:15.875
What a delightful group.

14:15.875 --> 14:18.958
Montel, sweetie, talk to me.

14:18.958 --> 14:22.125
What on earth are you gonna do
if you're not a Hormone Monster?

14:22.125 --> 14:26.500
Well... I-- I plan to become a Shame Wizard.

14:26.500 --> 14:27.750
- What?!
- No!

14:27.750 --> 14:29.708
I-- I've thought about this a lot.

14:29.708 --> 14:32.583
I like the clothes,
I like seeing humans in a tortured state,

14:32.583 --> 14:34.500
and I think I'd be really good at it.

14:34.500 --> 14:37.875
Well, do you think you'd be good
at being shunned by your entire community?

14:37.875 --> 14:39.208
That's what's gonna happen

14:39.208 --> 14:42.166
if you don't masturbate to completion
on that stage tomorrow.

14:42.166 --> 14:46.375
What your father means to say
is we just want what's best for you.

14:46.375 --> 14:49.875
No, what I mean to say is
how the fuck did this happen?

14:49.875 --> 14:52.250
Connie, do you think
this is maybe our fault?

14:52.250 --> 14:55.333
I mean, is it possible we were <i>too</i> horny?

14:55.333 --> 14:58.000
Or not horny enough?
No, no, no, too horny.

14:58.000 --> 15:00.083
- Yeah, too horny.
- Definitely too horny.

15:00.083 --> 15:02.291
Guys, it's not like I'd be
the first creature

15:02.291 --> 15:03.833
to switch to another line of work.

15:03.833 --> 15:07.166
Montel, baby, if you're scared
about jacking off in front of people--

15:07.166 --> 15:08.791
It's not that.

15:08.791 --> 15:13.791
This is about me pursuing my destiny,
and my destiny is in shame.

15:13.791 --> 15:15.875
But you're gonna make it
so hard for yourself.

15:15.875 --> 15:17.958
You'll face prejudice, Montel.

15:17.958 --> 15:20.791
I am so cruel
to people that are different than me.

15:20.791 --> 15:22.500
Uh, Maury, walk it back.

15:22.500 --> 15:26.291
What I'm trying to say is
everyone will hate you, my sweet baby,

15:26.291 --> 15:27.708
just like they hate Lionel.

15:27.708 --> 15:29.958
Well, I don't hate Lionel.
I find him inspiring.

15:31.666 --> 15:33.833
Now you're just trying to hurt Daddy.

15:33.833 --> 15:38.083
Sweetie, you gotta realize,
this is very important to your father.

15:38.083 --> 15:42.375
Oh, come on, Connie. Not you too.
You're supposed to be the better one.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.583
I <i>am</i> the better one.

15:43.583 --> 15:47.291
Montel, you are getting Jizz Mitzvah'ed
whether you like it or not.

15:47.291 --> 15:50.125
The heck I am.

15:50.708 --> 15:54.708
Looks like we're gonna have to sedate them
and <i>Weekend at Bernie's</i> this Jizz Mitzvah.

15:54.708 --> 15:55.833
Way ahead of you.

15:55.833 --> 15:56.791
Ow!

15:56.791 --> 15:59.458
- Aw, shit, I darted you.
- Oh, I love you.

16:02.875 --> 16:04.583
What? What's happening?

16:04.583 --> 16:07.333
Why the hell did you set an alarm
for 1:00 a.m.?

16:07.333 --> 16:08.416
Ohh, oh.

16:08.416 --> 16:11.875
It's my one-night-stand insurance policy.
I never spend the night.

16:11.875 --> 16:13.875
Well then how are we gonna parlay
this meet-cute

16:13.875 --> 16:15.250
into a full-blown relationship?

16:15.250 --> 16:19.958
Honey, we're not here for a relationship.
We're here for fun. Then we skedaddle.

16:19.958 --> 16:22.666
- AKA the smash and dash.
- The nail and bail.

16:22.666 --> 16:24.166
The fuck and duck.

16:24.166 --> 16:26.458
But hold on, I-I'm all for fun,

16:26.458 --> 16:30.625
but wouldn't it also be fun
to, like, sleep over,

16:30.625 --> 16:34.750
have breakfast together,
spend the whole day doing sex and TV?

16:34.750 --> 16:38.708
I mean, I kind of wouldn't mind
spending the day with this guy.

16:38.708 --> 16:40.750
- And then what? Start dating?
- Yes.

16:40.750 --> 16:42.375
- Become exclusive?
- Of course.

16:42.375 --> 16:43.833
- Move in?
- That sounds good.

16:43.833 --> 16:46.541
Break up? Be miserable? Cry on the subway?

16:46.541 --> 16:47.708
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

16:47.708 --> 16:50.958
Van, don't you think
you're being a little pessimistic?

16:50.958 --> 16:54.916
Uh, no. We had fun. It was great.
Now let's just take the win.

16:54.916 --> 16:58.666
Huh. I'm not sure I've ever taken the win.

16:58.666 --> 17:00.083
Em, listen.

17:00.083 --> 17:03.833
I've crunched the numbers on love,
and the stats are pure ass.

17:03.833 --> 17:07.208
These relationship things,
they almost always end in heartbreak.

17:07.208 --> 17:09.041
- Or death.
- Exactly.

17:09.041 --> 17:13.083
So let's just remember this
beautiful experience and move forward.

17:13.083 --> 17:15.916
And it was a beautiful experience, right?

17:15.916 --> 17:17.875
So beautiful.

17:17.875 --> 17:19.458
- Great. Can we bounce?
- Wait.

17:19.458 --> 17:22.458
Uh, can we just steal something
to remember him by?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.250
Yes. Love it. How about some cash?

17:24.250 --> 17:27.041
Mmm, I was thinking
something more intimate.

17:27.958 --> 17:29.833
- Okay.
- Deodorant?

17:29.833 --> 17:31.791
I panicked.

17:31.791 --> 17:34.250
Oh, yeah. We can work with this.

17:35.916 --> 17:37.708
Good morning. Hi.

17:37.708 --> 17:41.166
Hi, nice to see you.
Oh, your breasts look lovely today.

17:41.166 --> 17:43.041
I told you Montel wasn't gonna show up.

17:43.041 --> 17:46.208
And now the ice sculpture is melting,
the dick daisies are wilting,

17:46.208 --> 17:48.250
and nothing is going according to plan.

17:48.250 --> 17:51.500
Hi, lovely to see you.
Your ass is exquisite.

17:51.500 --> 17:53.333
Oh, is that an iTunes gift card?

17:53.333 --> 17:55.125
Thanks for coming.

17:55.125 --> 17:57.875
Oh, there's Pete and Mona.
Let's go say hi.

17:57.875 --> 18:00.166
- I bet he'd love that.
- Excuse me?

18:00.166 --> 18:02.833
Listen, babe,
I didn't wanna have to do this,

18:02.833 --> 18:05.166
but, like, you can't talk
to Pete anymore, okay?

18:05.166 --> 18:06.250
What? Why not?

18:06.250 --> 18:08.666
- He's fuckin' in love with you.
- No, he isn't.

18:08.666 --> 18:13.041
Yeah, he is. He's dying for you
to give him a Melbourne handshake.

18:13.041 --> 18:14.708
He practically admitted it to me

18:14.708 --> 18:17.541
right after he separated me
from my favorite fucking donger.

18:17.541 --> 18:21.000
- He said that?
- Look, it's gonna be him or me, all right?

18:21.000 --> 18:24.000
You're being insane.
I'm not gonna stop talking to my friend.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.125
So, what? You're--
You're picking him over me?

18:26.125 --> 18:29.041
- That's not what I said.
- Good. You'll never talk to him again.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.208
- It's agreed.
- No, it's not!

18:30.208 --> 18:33.916
You're seriously gaslighting me right now,
and I need a drink.

18:33.916 --> 18:36.208
Van is such a fucking blast.

18:36.208 --> 18:40.791
She uses logic as an argument
to, like, party and have casual sex.

18:40.791 --> 18:42.250
- She's awesome.
- Ooh!

18:42.250 --> 18:45.958
Sounds like you wanna go
spelunking in her Van cave.

18:45.958 --> 18:48.000
No, I don't.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.666
Well, unless that means
having sex with Van,

18:50.666 --> 18:53.833
in which case, yes, I do.

18:53.833 --> 18:56.666
What's going on?
Where's the pervert of honor?

18:56.666 --> 18:58.416
Oh, they'll be here any minute.

18:58.416 --> 19:01.708
They're just in the back chubbing up,
getting ready for the big event.

19:01.708 --> 19:05.833
Maury, we both know where Montel is.
You gotta go make this right.

19:05.833 --> 19:08.958
Oh, I know. And I'm gonna miss
the passed apps.

19:08.958 --> 19:12.416
Save me some jalapeñis poppers
and some dicks in a blanket

19:12.416 --> 19:13.875
and also some egg rolls.

19:13.875 --> 19:17.791
And when we skedaddled
I convinced Sarah to steal his deodorant.

19:17.791 --> 19:22.000
So, yeah, I'm killing it
both personally and professionally.

19:22.000 --> 19:25.041
Hold up. You guys did
a post-meet-cute skedaddle?

19:25.041 --> 19:29.458
A skedaddle is the enemy of love.
It undercuts the meet-cute.

19:29.458 --> 19:34.750
No way. Van says it just leaves you open
for more meet-cutes.

19:34.750 --> 19:40.333
Emmy, if you want love to blossom
with this guy, you can't be skedaddling.

19:40.333 --> 19:43.875
Well, maybe we <i>don't</i> want love.
I mean, then what?

19:43.875 --> 19:46.791
They move in together
and inevitably break up?

19:46.791 --> 19:48.916
Listen to you! Ugh!

19:48.916 --> 19:51.541
This rock brainwashed you
into being a Lovebug

19:51.541 --> 19:53.583
who doesn't believe in love anymore.

19:53.583 --> 19:55.166
- Yeah, I'm with Walter.
- God!

19:55.166 --> 19:58.083
Do you always have to show up
right when I'm about to win an argument?

19:58.083 --> 20:00.000
You were not gonna win.

20:00.000 --> 20:02.416
Van played you. She's a Logic Rock.

20:02.416 --> 20:05.583
We are, as a species,
much smarter than Lovebugs.

20:05.583 --> 20:09.666
- Well, Petes, as a species, smell like--
- Feces?

20:09.666 --> 20:11.250
Uh, no.

20:11.250 --> 20:13.833
Shit. [chuckles] Bitch.

20:15.458 --> 20:19.333
Ugh, of course that shame-soaked weirdo
lives in an abandoned church.

20:20.125 --> 20:21.125
Montel?

20:21.125 --> 20:22.666
Montel!

20:22.666 --> 20:25.416
Welcome to my humble home, Maurice.

20:25.416 --> 20:28.208
Can I offer you some tabernacle wine?

20:28.208 --> 20:30.625
Or perhaps a disgusting cracker?

20:30.625 --> 20:32.916
Where is my child, you floating freak?

20:32.916 --> 20:34.291
Hello, Mama Maury.

20:38.375 --> 20:40.791
- Wow, great entrance.
- Thank you.

20:40.791 --> 20:43.041
Montel, I am done with your little games.

20:43.041 --> 20:45.958
There is an entire ballroom
of my friends and colleagues

20:45.958 --> 20:48.000
waiting for you to publicly masturbate.

20:48.000 --> 20:49.375
You are coming with me now.

20:49.375 --> 20:51.041
Oh, no, I shan't.

20:51.041 --> 20:52.833
- Oh, yes, you shan.
- Shan't!

20:52.833 --> 20:54.375
Wha-- Why are you doing this to me?

20:54.375 --> 20:59.000
I'm not doing it <i>to</i> you.
Don't you get it? It's not about you.

20:59.000 --> 21:00.791
- Work, bitch.
- You shut it.

21:00.791 --> 21:05.833
Montel, how could it not be about me?
You're rejecting everything I stand for.

21:05.833 --> 21:08.416
But what about what <i>I</i> stand for?

21:08.416 --> 21:11.583
Honey, I support anything you want to do,

21:11.583 --> 21:13.916
but, yuck, a Shame Wizard?

21:13.916 --> 21:19.208
Oh, listen to you. You're so prejudiced.
You sound like a miserable old bigot.

21:19.208 --> 21:23.375
Hey! I am not old. I am young and cool
and everyone knows that.

21:23.375 --> 21:25.916
Right, because all the young,
cool monsters

21:25.916 --> 21:29.083
make their children feel
like a disappointment for being different.

21:29.083 --> 21:31.958
Well, that's not what I'm doing... is it?

21:31.958 --> 21:37.875
Well, yeah. You made me feel
like you don't love me for who I am.

21:37.875 --> 21:41.125
Oh my God. I've been a bad Mama Maury.

21:41.125 --> 21:45.375
And how does that make you feel,
Mr. Young Cool Monster?

21:45.375 --> 21:48.166
I'm... [sniffles] I'm so ashamed of myself.

21:48.166 --> 21:50.500
And that's a Yahtzee.

21:50.500 --> 21:53.208
You see, Maurice? Your child's a savant.

21:53.208 --> 21:56.625
- Wow, you really do have a gift, Montel.
- Thank you.

21:56.625 --> 21:59.083
And I gotta tell ya,
I did not plan to back down.

21:59.083 --> 22:02.791
In fact, I was fully prepared
to ruin our relationship,

22:02.791 --> 22:04.375
and then murder Lionel.

22:04.375 --> 22:05.583
Eh... What's that now?

22:06.416 --> 22:10.458
All right, now that I've sung
Sondheim's entire body of work,

22:10.458 --> 22:14.000
I will list my sexual partners
from the 1990s,

22:14.000 --> 22:16.416
starting with Mr. Paul Reiser.

22:17.750 --> 22:19.708
Hurry up, Maurice.

22:19.708 --> 22:22.375
Hey, Van, uh, just so you know.

22:22.375 --> 22:25.083
- I, like, believe in love, okay?
- Okay.

22:25.083 --> 22:28.416
And I know you're all cool and fun
and good at your job,

22:28.416 --> 22:31.291
but I'm getting actually good
at my job too.

22:31.291 --> 22:34.500
And love, it's important.
I believe in it, and I--

22:37.208 --> 22:38.875
What the fuck?

22:38.875 --> 22:42.916
Eh, it's just the way you were talking,
all passionately.

22:42.916 --> 22:45.750
- I just felt like I had to kiss you.
- Oh, my God.

22:45.750 --> 22:48.708
You're so random. Stop!

22:48.708 --> 22:50.791
So, uh, what were you saying before?

22:50.791 --> 22:53.375
I, um... I have no idea.

22:53.375 --> 22:55.791
I guess it wasn't that important then,
right, Em?

22:55.791 --> 22:59.291
Yeah, you're probably hot.
I mean, you're probably right.

22:59.291 --> 23:03.333
Bye, Daddy. I mean Mommy.
Uh, I mean, officer?

23:03.333 --> 23:05.333
Fuck! Get outta here, Emmy.

23:05.333 --> 23:08.166
Ooh, you're my favorite server,
you know that?

23:08.166 --> 23:09.791
It's because of your tits.

23:09.791 --> 23:11.041
Hey, Rochelle.

23:11.041 --> 23:15.375
I'm sorry if me wearing the jacket
made Dante upset or drunk or something.

23:15.375 --> 23:17.333
Pete, stop. It's not your fault.

23:17.333 --> 23:20.916
- Hey! Get away from her, rock.
- Dante, what the fuck?

23:20.916 --> 23:22.875
- Oh, shit.
- Fuckin' knew this was comin'.

23:22.875 --> 23:25.500
- First you cut my favorite dick off.
- You were gonna die.

23:25.500 --> 23:28.083
And then you accept presents
from my girlfriend?

23:28.083 --> 23:30.958
Okay, well, the present was technically
before the dick-cutting--

23:30.958 --> 23:31.916
Oh, Pete, Pete, Pete.

23:31.916 --> 23:34.583
So what's next? You-- You gonna
go down on her in front of me, mate?

23:34.583 --> 23:35.541
- Huh?
- What the fuck?

23:35.541 --> 23:38.916
Throw her on that table? Theragun
her doorbell until her head falls off?

23:38.916 --> 23:39.833
God!

23:39.833 --> 23:41.375
- No!
-"Theragun her doorbell"?

23:41.375 --> 23:42.666
Should I get a Theragun?

23:42.666 --> 23:46.166
You think I'm not a man anymore
'cause I only have two dicks, huh?

23:46.166 --> 23:47.833
Dante, chill the fuck out.

23:47.833 --> 23:49.791
Stay out of this. You've done enough.

23:49.791 --> 23:50.875
Hey!

23:52.166 --> 23:53.583
- Oh, my God!
- Holy shit!

23:54.166 --> 23:57.500
Holy shit! Do I wanna fuck Pete?

23:57.500 --> 23:58.791
Get in line.

23:58.791 --> 24:02.458
Look, uh, Dante,
I am so sorry to have to do that.

24:02.458 --> 24:04.666
- It's just that, uh--
- You're dead, Pete.

24:04.666 --> 24:06.333
Excuse me?

24:06.333 --> 24:10.666
I'm gonna find a way to get you
and ruin your goddamn life.

24:10.666 --> 24:13.000
That is, like, a very direct threat.

24:13.000 --> 24:16.208
Dante, you're being an asshole.
Leave him alone.

24:16.208 --> 24:19.625
- How about I leave you alone, forever?
- What?

24:19.625 --> 24:22.583
And just so you know, I never loved you.

24:22.583 --> 24:25.875
- I was only addicted to you.
- Dante?

24:25.875 --> 24:30.666
Every fucking moment I spent with you
was a complete waste of time.

24:30.666 --> 24:32.125
My God.

24:32.125 --> 24:34.958
You can all rot in hell.

24:34.958 --> 24:36.375
Dante out! Ha!

24:40.500 --> 24:42.041
I, um...

24:43.958 --> 24:46.458
All right.
You can all stop being bored now.

24:46.458 --> 24:51.250
- We have finally arrived.
- And yes, my belt buckle is a seatbelt.

24:51.250 --> 24:53.125
Everyone, everyone, quiet down.

24:53.125 --> 24:56.000
My beautiful child
has an announcement to make.

24:56.000 --> 24:58.000
And they have my full support.

24:58.875 --> 25:01.000
Hormone Monsters, Monstresses,

25:01.000 --> 25:05.333
and other creatures from my parents' work
who I neither know nor care about,

25:05.333 --> 25:07.125
while I'll always be horny...

25:07.125 --> 25:08.041
- Whoo!
- Oh, yeah!

25:08.041 --> 25:11.625
...my true passion
is making humans feel like shit.

25:11.625 --> 25:13.000
Yes, there it is.

25:13.000 --> 25:15.833
So I will not be Jizz Mitzvah'ed today.

25:15.833 --> 25:19.458
- What?
- Because I am becoming a Shame Wizard.

25:20.875 --> 25:24.250
No, not "boo." Not "boo."
Opposite of "boo." "Yay!"

25:24.250 --> 25:27.708
Hey, hey, as much as
it pains me to say it, I...

25:27.708 --> 25:29.166
Ugh.

25:29.166 --> 25:30.666
...agree with Lionel.

25:30.666 --> 25:34.750
Not "boo," "yay" to my child
for being their true self.

25:34.750 --> 25:37.166
But who's gonna cum behind the curtain?

25:37.166 --> 25:39.083
Yeah, it's a million years bad luck

25:39.083 --> 25:41.916
to have a Jizz Mitzvah
without a curtain squirtin'.

25:41.916 --> 25:44.833
- We demand an ejaculation!
- Let's get juicy, baby.

25:44.833 --> 25:47.333
Then we'll do it. Maurice?

25:47.333 --> 25:48.750
After you, Constance.

25:52.458 --> 25:54.708
- And done.
- Oh my God, already?

25:54.708 --> 25:56.166
Shit. Now it's getting soft.

25:56.166 --> 25:58.083
Connie! Connie!

25:58.083 --> 26:02.166
Oh, no. It's my Jizz Mitzvah
all over again.

26:02.166 --> 26:04.750
- Connie! Connie!
- Oh, Connie, they really do like you more.

26:04.750 --> 26:06.708
Aw, Maury.

26:06.708 --> 26:09.000
