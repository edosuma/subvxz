00:02.160 --> 00:03.491
Previously on Arrow and Flash...

00:03.680 --> 00:06.365
<i>Brie Larvan, a quite brilliant roboticist</i>

00:06.520 --> 00:09.603
who once developed miniature
mechanical bees for military use.

00:09.760 --> 00:13.367
Barry, I hacked into the bees' frequency.
I'm controlling them.

00:13.520 --> 00:15.204
- Brie's restrained.
- Boom!

00:15.360 --> 00:16.691
It's an implantable bio stimulant.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.888
This little piece of technology
is gonna help me walk again?

00:19.080 --> 00:20.889
After it's implanted in your spine. Yes.

00:21.080 --> 00:24.641
I found Quentin Lance's testimony
to be particularly compelling.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.529
<i>On the strength of it,</i>

00:26.720 --> 00:30.281
<i>Mr. Darhk will be held without bail
or possibility of release.</i>

00:31.240 --> 00:34.722
It is too hard to be here
with you every night and not be with you.

00:34.880 --> 00:36.564
I don't wanna let you go.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.444
But I'm already gone.

01:00.640 --> 01:02.165
Computer time's up, blondie.

01:02.320 --> 01:03.321
Don't think so.

01:03.480 --> 01:06.643
The judge granted me
a minimum of 30 minutes per week.

01:06.840 --> 01:08.285
I have 90 more seconds.

01:08.440 --> 01:10.283
The judge ain't here. lam.

01:11.640 --> 01:15.167
Let's see what you're so hot for
without an Internet connection.

01:15.320 --> 01:16.481
Bees.

01:17.040 --> 01:18.405
I like bees.

01:32.040 --> 01:33.530
Thea, your back foot's sliding out.

01:33.680 --> 01:35.250
No, it's not!

01:37.960 --> 01:40.008
Just because you can't see me,
doesn't mean I'm not there.

01:40.200 --> 01:43.044
You've got to sense my presence,
even when I'm not in your eye-line.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.362
What advice would you give to me?

01:45.520 --> 01:46.567
Humor me.

01:46.720 --> 01:48.051
Getting tired,
you're dropping your shoulder

01:48.200 --> 01:49.361
and you're opening yourself up.

01:58.600 --> 02:01.729
So you took your morning run
from six miles, to what?

02:01.920 --> 02:03.365
Maybe two?

02:03.600 --> 02:06.206
Yeah, well, taking care of
a toddler is a marathon in itself.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.930
Right, but when you sacrifice
your endurance,

02:08.080 --> 02:10.526
you're losing steam too early
in our sessions.

02:10.680 --> 02:12.569
Let's go again. 41lpass.

02:12.760 --> 02:15.206
I keep on running out of excuses
for all my new bruises.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.846
And they're from you, not bad guys.

02:18.320 --> 02:20.846
The streets have gone quiet
since we took Darhk off the board.

02:21.000 --> 02:23.606
His organization hasn't been.
HIVE is still out there.

02:23.760 --> 02:25.649
Yeah. And when they rear their head,
we'll take care of them,

02:25.800 --> 02:26.801
but we have to celebrate our victories.

02:27.000 --> 02:29.287
If we don't,
we forget what we're fighting for.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.010
What's wrong?

02:31.160 --> 02:33.401
Alex has a new job interview.

02:34.040 --> 02:36.247
- With Ruvé Darhk.
- What?

02:36.440 --> 02:39.762
She's looking for a new chief of staff
for the April 6th election.

02:39.920 --> 02:40.921
Oh, still don't know see
why you just can't

02:41.080 --> 02:42.127
put yourself back in the race, Oliver.

02:42.280 --> 02:45.727
You know, voters, they hate flip-flopping
and that would be a pretty big one.

02:45.880 --> 02:49.521
I can't let him work for the wife
of the prince of darkness.

02:49.720 --> 02:51.165
And what if he got a better offer?

02:51.320 --> 02:52.685
Are you gonna run for mayor?

02:52.840 --> 02:54.285
Palmer Tech.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.648
They're hiring
a new head of public relations.

02:56.800 --> 02:57.881
Oh.

02:58.440 --> 03:01.762
I just heard that from someone.

03:02.600 --> 03:05.080
Laurel, she's not Voldemort.

03:05.600 --> 03:06.886
And I'm fine.

03:07.120 --> 03:10.522
That's a good idea.
You should tell Alex to talk to Felicity.

03:10.680 --> 03:11.761
Mmm-hmm.

03:12.560 --> 03:14.881
- What?
- Nothing. It's just...

03:15.440 --> 03:17.807
What, it's shocking
that you know who Voldemort is.

03:17.960 --> 03:19.564
Well, I mean,
I'm not immune to pop culture.

03:19.760 --> 03:21.171
I read a few of the <i>Harry Potter</i> books.

03:21.320 --> 03:24.688
Really? I was gonna bet Thea
that you just saw the movies.

03:25.200 --> 03:26.770
There were movies?

03:32.280 --> 03:34.567
Mr. Queen. Where are my men?

03:34.760 --> 03:36.330
I don't know, Reiter.

03:36.480 --> 03:37.891
They're your men.

03:38.320 --> 03:40.322
I wasn't gonna wait around
for them to kill me.

03:40.480 --> 03:42.801
And what of Ms. Venediktov?

03:43.480 --> 03:44.891
She's still here.

03:45.480 --> 03:46.970
Don't move.

03:48.440 --> 03:50.920
- Where's my idol?
- It's not your concern anymore.

03:51.120 --> 03:53.771
It's nearby. I can feel it.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.241
The powers it bestowed
are on the wane, but...

03:56.400 --> 03:57.640
Enough!

04:02.880 --> 04:06.680
As I was saying,
the magics are losing their potency,

04:07.200 --> 04:11.046
but I still have enough
to make short work of the two of you.

04:12.800 --> 04:15.485
A quarter of a million dollars per unit.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.649
It's hard to believe something so small
could cost so much money...

04:18.800 --> 04:23.681
When Digital Equipment Corporation
released the first VAX, it cost $700,000.

04:30.280 --> 04:32.647
Honestly, I think of this as a bargain.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.290
Except we're not starting
a computer revolution here.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.488
We're trying to repair spinal injuries.

04:36.640 --> 04:41.248
The new estimate of spinal injuries
per year are at 12,000 people.

04:41.920 --> 04:45.367
Unless everyone's a billionaire,
walking again is a luxury item.

04:45.520 --> 04:46.885
Sounds like something
Mr. Dennis would say.

04:47.040 --> 04:48.121
He already has.

04:48.280 --> 04:49.520
He's called a board meeting to discuss

04:49.720 --> 04:52.200
how many zeroes he can add
to the end of that price point.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.727
Anything I can do to help you?

04:54.880 --> 04:56.928
No, you can't do anything with that cold.
Go home, get some rest.

04:57.080 --> 04:58.081
Get some chicken noodle soup.

04:58.240 --> 04:59.605
You sound like my mother.

04:59.760 --> 05:00.807
Yeah, I'm sure if she was here,

05:00.960 --> 05:04.043
she'd tell you to listen
to my favorite girl.

05:04.400 --> 05:05.447
Hi, honey.

05:05.600 --> 05:09.844
Fine, but only because my cold medication
is starting to make me see double.

05:10.080 --> 05:11.491
- Aw...
- Help. Help me, help...

05:11.640 --> 05:14.246
Did you hear that?
He thinks we look like twins.

05:14.400 --> 05:15.606
I don't think that's what he said.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.171
I think he did.

05:17.320 --> 05:18.446
What can I help you with, Mom?

05:18.600 --> 05:21.843
Well, my beautiful baby girl.
I am here to rescue you.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.764
- Oh.
- After the...

05:25.240 --> 05:28.210
B-R-E-A-C-K-U-P.

05:28.520 --> 05:31.410
You could use some
regular socialization so...

05:31.960 --> 05:33.450
How about leisurely lunch?

05:33.640 --> 05:34.687
Oh, my God. I don't know what's worse.

05:34.840 --> 05:37.366
The fact that you just spelled out breakup
or that you misspelled it.

05:37.560 --> 05:38.800
- Huh?
- Yeah.

05:39.000 --> 05:40.490
- No.
- No, Mom. I'm fine.

05:40.640 --> 05:41.801
I have a lot of work to do.

05:41.960 --> 05:43.689
No. Just a quick one. Sweetie...

05:43.840 --> 05:45.683
Sorry. Is this a bad time?

05:45.880 --> 05:48.486
You people are like Tribbles today.
What's up? Everything okay with...

05:48.640 --> 05:50.165
- Oliver?
- I was gonna say your night job.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.560
You know, that thing that you do at night.

05:51.720 --> 05:53.404
Yeah, no, that... That's fine.

05:53.560 --> 05:55.722
Ollie is fine too.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.809
It's actually about Alex.

05:58.040 --> 06:00.122
Um, he's no longer working
on the campaign so I was...

06:00.280 --> 06:02.203
Oh, my God, it's Mr. Dennis.

06:02.360 --> 06:03.361
I have a board meeting.

06:03.520 --> 06:06.444
You know what? He's a jerk. He can wait.

06:08.040 --> 06:10.361
What did you wanna ask me about Alex?

06:12.800 --> 06:14.802
You know,
usually someone buys me dinner

06:14.960 --> 06:16.962
before we start breaking out the cuffs.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.883
I thought you just lost your magic,
but your charm seems to be waning as well.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.405
How the hell did you get in here?

06:26.560 --> 06:27.891
I used to be Ra's al Ghul.

06:28.040 --> 06:29.041
Yes. This, I know.

06:29.240 --> 06:30.651
What I'm less clear of,

06:30.800 --> 06:33.371
is why my resources haven't been deployed
to get me out of here.

06:33.520 --> 06:35.966
Well, that's what I'm here to explain.

06:36.480 --> 06:38.642
Although my time in here
might be limitless, Malcolm,

06:38.800 --> 06:39.801
my patience isn't.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.161
That's cute.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.280
As I was saying,
I've been in touch with your resources

06:44.440 --> 06:47.444
and they don't seem to have any particular
love left for you, Damien.

06:47.600 --> 06:50.331
Something to do with hocus and pocus

06:50.520 --> 06:53.285
and killing fellow members
when you get miffed.

06:53.680 --> 06:56.763
HIVE is moving forward with Genesis
but not with you.

06:57.080 --> 07:00.004
They like you here, out of trouble.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.806
But they do wish you the best of luck
with your trial.

07:05.600 --> 07:07.841
Don't be embarrassed.

07:08.040 --> 07:11.328
Performance issues are common
for men of your age.

07:25.640 --> 07:27.927
Well, you really do have eyes
in the back of your head.

07:28.080 --> 07:30.970
- I thought you had work to do.
- I realized it could wait.

07:31.120 --> 07:34.044
You've been pushing us pretty hard
and I know why.

07:34.520 --> 07:36.409
Oliver, it's okay to miss Felicity.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.570
I... I appreciate what you're doing
but I don't think that you're the...

07:39.720 --> 07:41.722
Person to help you through it?

07:42.000 --> 07:43.126
Why?

07:43.880 --> 07:46.201
- Because of what we used to have?
- Yeah.

07:46.400 --> 07:48.004
But maybe,
it just gave me a little insight.

07:48.160 --> 07:52.324
Well, I mean, in fairness,
I did wreck what we had too, so...

07:52.520 --> 07:56.320
In your defense, you were missing
and presumed dead for five years,

07:56.520 --> 07:58.363
but that's not what I mean.

07:58.880 --> 08:00.723
I know how passionately you love

08:00.880 --> 08:03.611
and how much it hurts
once that love goes away.

08:04.920 --> 08:06.445
You know, between...

08:07.760 --> 08:11.845
Merlyn, Slade Wilson and Ra's al Ghul,
I thought that I'd be a little...

08:12.440 --> 08:13.965
Tougher than this by now.

08:14.120 --> 08:16.202
That's a different type of pain.

08:16.840 --> 08:18.842
And this takes longer to heal.

08:19.160 --> 08:20.764
But I'm here for you.

08:21.600 --> 08:22.726
Thank you.

08:27.560 --> 08:28.925
You're not late, Phil.

08:29.080 --> 08:31.287
We're still waiting on Ms. Smoak.

08:36.520 --> 08:37.965
Are you all right?

08:38.720 --> 08:41.849
Phil? Phil? Phil!

08:44.159 --> 08:45.525
I'm calling 911.

08:46.040 --> 08:48.122
I can't get a signal!

08:50.960 --> 08:53.327
You'll have to excuse my tiny friends.

08:53.640 --> 08:57.690
Their bee-havior can be
appalling sometimes.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.081
But it's a necessary evil.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.886
You see, I needed your full attention.

09:05.080 --> 09:06.525
What the hell do you want?

09:06.680 --> 09:09.251
Straight to the point. I like that.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.964
Your CEO has miraculously recovered
from paralysis,

09:13.160 --> 09:16.562
thanks to an implantable
bio-stimulant microchip.

09:17.200 --> 09:21.285
Hand one over and I'll "bee" on my way.

09:21.680 --> 09:22.886
There's only one prototype.

09:23.080 --> 09:25.082
The one inside Felicity Smoak.

09:25.560 --> 09:29.201
So, what's a girl gotta do
to get on her calendar?

09:30.320 --> 09:31.606
I can talk to Alex if you want,

09:31.800 --> 09:33.564
but I can't promise a job
he'll be excited about.

09:33.760 --> 09:36.445
Probably best to keep him away
from a super-villain's wife.

09:36.600 --> 09:39.331
Yep, you're right about that.

09:40.320 --> 09:41.845
<i>Hello out there.</i>

09:42.000 --> 09:43.001
What the hell?

09:43.160 --> 09:45.083
<i>I am looking for Felicity Smoak.</i>

09:45.240 --> 09:49.802
<i>Because it would be swell if we could chat
about a certain implantable bio-chip.</i>

09:50.480 --> 09:54.280
<i>I'm sure your board would
really appreciate it.</i>

10:01.920 --> 10:03.251
Brie Larvan.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.408
- You know this wackadoodle?
- I had a run-in with her last year.

10:05.560 --> 10:07.881
If this Brie Larvan is coming for you,
we need to get you out of here.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.411
No, no, no.
No, I don't think she knew who I was.

10:09.560 --> 10:10.561
She's after something else.

10:10.720 --> 10:11.926
She said something about an implant.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.242
A bio-stimulant microchip.
There's only one working prototype.

10:14.400 --> 10:16.084
- Where is it?
- In the base of my spine.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.447
Which brings me back to,
we need to get you the hell out of here.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.090
But we have to get everyone out of here.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.241
I can't even get a signal.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.402
<i>She's jammed all communications.</i>

10:23.600 --> 10:25.090
Oh, my God...

10:28.680 --> 10:30.967
<i>Eyewitnesses report
the bees have been swarming</i>

10:31.120 --> 10:32.645
<i>the Palmer Tech headquarters</i>

10:32.800 --> 10:33.961
<i>for the past 20 minutes.</i>

10:34.120 --> 10:36.361
<i>Now all communications in and out
of the building have been cut off.</i>

10:36.520 --> 10:37.931
Have you seen this?

10:38.080 --> 10:39.445
I was just there.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.126
I'd still be there if Felicity hadn't...

10:42.600 --> 10:44.250
Oh, my God. Felicity.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.248
But you have 104 fever.
Where do you think you're going?

10:53.400 --> 10:54.401
To get help.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.767
I'm pretty sure the police
already know about this.

10:56.920 --> 10:59.082
I'm not talking about the police.

10:59.280 --> 11:02.648
<i>We are hearing that SCPD
has sent in an ESU squad.</i>

11:02.800 --> 11:04.165
Felicity's in there.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.687
Thea, too. I tried calling but no answer.

11:06.840 --> 11:09.127
She must have already been inside
by the time the swarm hit.

11:11.640 --> 11:13.051
John's coming in.

11:13.240 --> 11:14.287
This is HIVE, right?

11:14.480 --> 11:16.084
There's no way
that this bee attack is a coincidence.

11:16.240 --> 11:19.642
I don't think it's HIVE
and I don't think those are bees.

11:22.160 --> 11:24.925
No. Bees don't give off hundreds
of different kinds of radio frequencies.

11:25.120 --> 11:26.406
Robot bees. Terrific.

11:26.560 --> 11:31.282
Last year, Felicity helped Barry Allen
take down the bees' inventor, Brie Larvan.

11:31.480 --> 11:32.527
So it's payback.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.170
Well, Larvan picked
a hell of a day for it.

11:34.320 --> 11:35.446
Donna is in there too.

11:35.600 --> 11:37.329
- What?
- She stopped by Felicity's office to

11:37.480 --> 11:39.562
you know, cheer her up a little.

11:41.600 --> 11:42.806
Suit up.

11:43.000 --> 11:44.001
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:44.160 --> 11:45.924
The departmentjust tried sending
in an ESU squad,

11:46.080 --> 11:47.127
they couldn't get through that swarm.

11:47.280 --> 11:48.884
Now if their Kevlar couldn't hold,

11:49.040 --> 11:50.690
what makes you think that yours will?

11:50.840 --> 11:52.126
We have to try.

11:55.800 --> 11:59.043
<i>I am running out of patience,
Felicity Smoak.</i>

11:59.280 --> 12:04.286
<i>You have 10 minutes
before I start voting board members out.</i>

12:04.480 --> 12:08.610
<i>FYI, my drones pack a lot more "Ow!"</i>

12:09.400 --> 12:11.129
<i>than your typical sting.</i>

12:11.360 --> 12:14.921
<i>Tick, took-Tick, took.</i>

12:16.240 --> 12:17.571
Okay, we need to get out of here.

12:17.720 --> 12:19.404
But, Thea, the bees are out there...

12:19.560 --> 12:21.130
Yeah, and sooner or later,
they're gonna be in here.

12:21.280 --> 12:23.806
Okay, you know...
From now on, I'm going with flats.

12:23.960 --> 12:25.803
<i>I mean, these assaults are weekly.
It's ridiculous.</i>

12:25.960 --> 12:28.566
It's just so not conducive
to high fashion.

12:30.240 --> 12:32.846
Okay, definitely sooner than later...

12:33.040 --> 12:35.486
- What? We're trapped?
- Uh, I don't know.

12:36.520 --> 12:38.045
- Not exactly.
- Okay.

12:38.720 --> 12:41.371
Although I definitely don't have
the right shoes for that.

12:41.520 --> 12:42.760
Oh, no, no, no.

12:43.840 --> 12:45.604
Hello?

12:50.880 --> 12:52.245
Anybody here?

12:55.000 --> 12:56.411
Yes, we are here, Curtis.

12:56.560 --> 12:59.291
And we just can't wait to hear
how you used the cell phone

12:59.440 --> 13:02.683
that we gave you
to help us rescue Dr. Palmer

13:02.920 --> 13:04.763
to track us back to our...

13:10.320 --> 13:11.924
Secret lair.

13:12.880 --> 13:14.325
Okay, so we don't need to
take out the bees.

13:14.520 --> 13:15.681
We just need to take out Larvan.

13:15.840 --> 13:19.401
Yeah, well, it doesn't make much sense
if we can't get inside.

13:22.800 --> 13:24.404
Holy frak...

13:27.800 --> 13:28.926
You're the...

13:29.120 --> 13:30.610
And wait, you're...

13:30.880 --> 13:32.928
Wait, wait, wait, you-you're...

13:33.480 --> 13:35.289
Uh, just so you guys know, if I pass out,

13:35.440 --> 13:38.523
it's because I'm sick,
not because you know...

13:39.400 --> 13:41.562
So can anybodyjust walk in here?

13:46.800 --> 13:49.883
So you're the infamous Damien Darhk.

13:50.320 --> 13:51.526
Oh, I get it.

13:51.760 --> 13:52.921
You're big fans, aren't ya?

13:53.080 --> 13:54.684
You want me to pose for a selfie?

13:54.840 --> 13:57.241
Back in Star City, you were a big deal.

13:57.800 --> 14:01.407
In here, the only big deal is him.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.450
Gentlemen, I think
we're getting off on the wrong foot.

14:05.600 --> 14:07.682
There must be some sort of way
that we can have...

14:07.840 --> 14:09.080
WOW.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.329
I'm sorry, I just gotta know,
did you sew that in yourself

14:12.480 --> 14:15.211
or do you have like some kind of
lip sewing guy?

14:28.600 --> 14:31.171
Stop right there!

14:32.120 --> 14:34.248
<i>Break it up!</i>

14:34.920 --> 14:36.524
How did you deal with her
in the first place?

14:36.680 --> 14:38.921
The old-fashioned way. Hacking.

14:39.080 --> 14:40.844
I can't do that without
a working computer.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.526
Okay. Well, at least all we have to do
is wait for Ollie

14:43.680 --> 14:44.727
and the rest of them to get here.

14:44.880 --> 14:46.882
Just when I thought I was out.

14:48.120 --> 14:50.202
I thought I left this all behind.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.683
- Did you hear that?
- Bee.

15:00.520 --> 15:02.682
Make that plural, bees,
in the air vents. Go!

15:17.520 --> 15:18.726
Curtis?

15:18.920 --> 15:20.331
Oh, this is so weird.

15:20.520 --> 15:24.206
I literallyjust had a dream
where you were the Green Arrow.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.323
Wait. This is happening.

15:26.520 --> 15:28.045
- You're the Green Arrow?
- Yeah.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.521
I could have sworn
it was Neal Adams in data processing.

15:30.680 --> 15:34.366
And this is the Arrow cave.
Oh, my God.

15:34.560 --> 15:37.723
Actually, we call it the bunk...
It's the bunker, but, yeah.

15:37.880 --> 15:39.530
You're Laurel Lance, the ADA.

15:39.680 --> 15:41.330
I've seen you on TV before.

15:41.480 --> 15:43.209
And you're Captain Lance.

15:43.360 --> 15:44.646
And you're...

15:45.080 --> 15:46.320
I'm sorry, I know I've met before

15:46.480 --> 15:47.970
but I can't really place
your name right now...

15:48.120 --> 15:51.010
Curtis, that's John Diggle.
I need you to focus for a second, please?

15:51.160 --> 15:54.881
Oh, my God. This place is unbelievable.

15:55.080 --> 15:57.003
I mean, you guys must be
drawing some crazy electricity.

15:57.160 --> 15:59.686
How do you keep it off the grid?

16:00.080 --> 16:02.811
This is STAR Labs 5000 Exostation.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.240
What are the specs on this?

16:04.440 --> 16:06.408
Curtis! Get it together.

16:06.600 --> 16:08.364
Okay, now I'm starting to see
the whole Green Arrow thing.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.045
And I'm actually starting
to feel better, too.

16:10.200 --> 16:12.806
That's because we gave you
an IV to rehydrate you.

16:12.960 --> 16:14.200
It should keep you going for a few hours.

16:14.360 --> 16:16.522
Okay, forget the how for a second.

16:17.160 --> 16:18.161
What are you doing here?

16:18.320 --> 16:20.288
I saw the beehive on the news.
Felicity's in there.

16:20.440 --> 16:22.204
Yeah, we were just about to mount
a rescue mission.

16:22.360 --> 16:23.521
Do you guys even know what that is?

16:23.680 --> 16:26.001
That is an army of robotic bees.

16:26.640 --> 16:28.404
Yeah, that's my life now.

16:29.720 --> 16:32.564
Brie Larvan. Apparently, she hacked
the prison computer network

16:32.760 --> 16:34.842
and got herself an early release. Clever.

16:35.000 --> 16:36.286
Feel free to use that by the way.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.169
I mean, you can't put me
in front of this beautiful machine

16:38.320 --> 16:40.129
and expect me not to
take it for a test drive.

16:40.280 --> 16:44.171
Looks like Felicity keeps files on
various criminals. Who's The Dodger?

16:44.320 --> 16:47.483
Looks like we have ourselves a taller,
more dude-like version of Felicity.

16:47.640 --> 16:48.641
And I can help.

16:48.800 --> 16:51.041
Now, look, these bees,
they're tiny computers, okay?

16:51.200 --> 16:52.247
With Felicity trapped inside,

16:52.400 --> 16:54.004
you guys are gonna need someone
to hack them,

16:54.200 --> 16:56.680
but I'll have to "bee" careful.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.684
- It's too soon for bee puns, right?
- Let's assume that it is.

17:01.840 --> 17:03.126
- Yeah.
- Curtis,

17:03.280 --> 17:06.284
can you immobilize enough bees
to give us a way in?

17:06.680 --> 17:08.887
There's only one way to find out.

17:09.680 --> 17:11.444
Do it.

17:11.640 --> 17:13.847
You want me on the team? I mean...

17:14.359 --> 17:16.567
- You want me on the team?
- Let's go.

17:17.079 --> 17:18.888
Whoo!

17:20.240 --> 17:23.722
You see now,
the value of my prize, Mr. Queen?

17:23.960 --> 17:25.371
What have you done to yourself?

17:25.560 --> 17:29.531
There are primordial energies
that flow through all things.

17:30.360 --> 17:32.362
I now command them.

17:32.560 --> 17:33.800
You're insane.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.723
Madness is a matter of perspective,
Mr. Queen.

17:38.200 --> 17:40.885
Your morality blinds you from
understanding what I have achieved.

17:41.080 --> 17:42.570
No, I understand.

17:42.720 --> 17:44.529
You're killing people to gain power.

17:44.680 --> 17:46.682
And what will you do about it?

17:47.400 --> 17:50.006
Now, tell me
where you have hidden my idol,

17:50.520 --> 17:53.285
and I promise to kill you both quickly.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.401
VVe1lpass.

18:03.280 --> 18:04.327
Thank God.

18:04.520 --> 18:07.205
Okay. How many are there?

18:07.680 --> 18:09.842
Just try to think happy thoughts.

18:12.720 --> 18:15.200
Okay. Now it's time to hack some bees.

18:17.880 --> 18:20.281
Okay, so that's what that button does.

18:26.280 --> 18:27.441
Felicity...

18:33.040 --> 18:34.326
<i>C U RTISI Felicity!</i>

18:34.480 --> 18:35.481
Curtis?

18:35.640 --> 18:36.641
<i>How do you know that bee's name?</i>

18:36.840 --> 18:39.047
I did it! I hacked the...

18:39.560 --> 18:40.800
Bees!

18:40.960 --> 18:42.962
<i>How did you... What are you doing there?</i>

18:43.120 --> 18:46.203
I know, right? I am still pinching myself.

18:49.640 --> 18:50.766
All the bees are gone.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.604
You're welcome.
The Green Arrow is on his way

18:52.760 --> 18:54.364
as well as Black Canary and Spartan.

18:54.520 --> 18:55.931
How cool is this?

18:56.120 --> 18:59.010
Uh, they'll meet you
at the west utility entrance.

18:59.240 --> 19:02.164
Can you get there?
Did I mention how cool this is?

19:04.520 --> 19:05.965
Curtis, have you deactivated the bees?

19:06.160 --> 19:08.003
Negative. Uh, I mean positive.

19:08.160 --> 19:10.527
Sorry, I'm nervous. The bees are down.

19:11.200 --> 19:12.281
Uh-oh.

19:12.480 --> 19:14.050
Now it's a negative. Negative!

19:14.200 --> 19:16.441
<i>The bees are back! I got kicked out!</i>

19:26.960 --> 19:28.405
Ahhh!

19:30.520 --> 19:34.002
Come on, they're okay.
Come on, get back inside. Back inside.

19:43.080 --> 19:44.366
What the hell happened to him?

19:44.520 --> 19:45.760
We couldn't see, I lost the feed.

19:45.920 --> 19:47.206
He got stung.

19:47.840 --> 19:50.366
Yeah, he's having some sort of reaction.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.964
He didn't just get stung.

19:55.480 --> 19:57.369
- The bee's inside you.
- Well, cut it out!

19:57.520 --> 19:59.204
Do you guys have
anesthesia around here or something?

19:59.360 --> 20:01.727
- Just do it!
- I can't find it, Oliver!

20:02.120 --> 20:04.248
Okay, actually,
and this is hard to believe...

20:04.400 --> 20:06.164
We have a bigger problem.

20:06.400 --> 20:09.688
The bee is replicating itself.
Inside Oliver.

20:14.720 --> 20:17.849
What did that thing do to the Green Arrow?

20:18.040 --> 20:19.883
Stung him. Badly.

20:20.760 --> 20:21.886
He'll be okay.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.929
And he'll be back. So will the others.

20:24.080 --> 20:25.445
How do you know?

20:25.600 --> 20:28.410
Hon, they just got their butts kicked,
by that...

20:28.560 --> 20:29.561
That bee man.

20:29.720 --> 20:31.722
This is why
we leave the nicknames to Cisco.

20:31.880 --> 20:33.564
- What?
- Inside joke.

20:35.560 --> 20:36.607
Oh.

20:36.800 --> 20:38.723
<i>I thought we were friends, Smoak.</i>

20:38.920 --> 20:40.888
<i>That you were gonna come through.</i>

20:41.040 --> 20:44.169
Ten minutes ago,
you had ten minutes to go.

20:44.680 --> 20:46.330
<i>You're out of time, glasses.</i>

20:46.480 --> 20:49.006
<i>Bee-cause we got interrupted,</i>

20:49.200 --> 20:50.850
<i>I'm gonna give you
an additional five minutes</i>

20:51.000 --> 20:54.243
<i>before I start taking
your board members off the board.</i>

20:57.160 --> 21:00.243
Oh, and your fiancé looks awfully sweet.

21:01.040 --> 21:02.087
<i>Sorry.</i>

21:02.440 --> 21:04.090
<i>Ex-fiancé.</i>

21:05.080 --> 21:06.241
Oh.

21:06.840 --> 21:08.922
Okay, you cannot turn yourself in.

21:09.120 --> 21:10.610
No, she'll kill everyone anyway.

21:10.760 --> 21:13.366
To think she's in your office...

21:13.960 --> 21:15.405
You're gonna have to sanitize.

21:15.560 --> 21:17.085
Yes. She is in my office.

21:17.240 --> 21:18.241
Which is A, yes, gross

21:18.400 --> 21:19.526
but B, means
she's not with the board members.

21:19.680 --> 21:21.569
You know,
since she brought up Oliver, honey,

21:21.720 --> 21:22.767
have you spoken to him since everything...

21:22.920 --> 21:23.921
Mom. Mom, Mom!

21:24.080 --> 21:25.809
- I'm thinking!
- I'm sorry. You know what, honey?

21:25.960 --> 21:27.883
I'm curious. Okay, I...

21:28.400 --> 21:29.731
I have an idea.

21:31.720 --> 21:32.721
It's not working!

21:32.880 --> 21:34.405
You did it while we were at Palmer Tech.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.204
The drone has evolved
and adapted since then.

21:36.360 --> 21:37.566
And the damn things are like the Borg.

21:37.720 --> 21:39.609
You know, the bad guys
in Star Trek which...

21:39.760 --> 21:40.761
I wish Felicity was here.

21:40.920 --> 21:42.331
Well, she's not, Curtis! You are!

21:42.480 --> 21:43.720
You have to be able to do something, okay?

21:43.880 --> 21:46.611
- When these things hit critical mass...
- It'll be like John Hurt in Alien.

21:46.760 --> 21:48.603
Sorry, when I get nervous
I make pop-culture references.

21:48.760 --> 21:50.489
Okay, you can't hack it out.
Can you lure it out?

21:50.640 --> 21:52.165
Like some kind of...
I can't believe I'm saying this,

21:52.320 --> 21:53.481
but some kind of digital honey
or something?

21:53.640 --> 21:57.087
Not exactly. But if these are really
modeled after bees then...

21:57.240 --> 21:59.322
They'll operate on a singular frequency
to orientate themselves.

21:59.480 --> 22:01.403
If we can disrupt it,
then we can disperse the colony.

22:01.560 --> 22:03.244
But, only problem is that
we need to generate

22:03.400 --> 22:05.482
a high enough frequency
to damage their network.

22:05.640 --> 22:09.645
But unless you guys have a portable
sonic projector handy, then, uh...

22:10.120 --> 22:11.167
What?

22:14.600 --> 22:15.965
This technology is amazing.

22:16.120 --> 22:18.805
It reads your own vocal emissions
and then reprocesses it

22:18.960 --> 22:20.689
via a digital output into a multichannel.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.921
Yeah, we get it. It's badass.

22:22.080 --> 22:24.082
But how is this going to help us
save Oliver?

22:24.280 --> 22:25.611
Just give him a full Mariah Carey

22:25.760 --> 22:28.286
and it should disrupt whatever connection
the bees are operating on.

22:28.440 --> 22:30.204
All right, man. You sure about this?

22:30.360 --> 22:32.966
We don't have time to be sure.

22:33.960 --> 22:35.291
Curtis, do it!

22:36.200 --> 22:38.328
Three, two, one...

22:59.520 --> 23:02.683
That was awesome.

23:07.960 --> 23:09.485
You son of a bitch.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.241
My victory is inevitable, Mr. Queen.

23:30.640 --> 23:35.009
Just think, all of this power came
from the life essence of one man.

23:35.240 --> 23:36.401
Imagine what I will become

23:36.600 --> 23:39.604
when dozens of lives
are sacrificed in my name.

23:39.920 --> 23:42.161
You'll become a monster.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.607
No. A god.

23:45.240 --> 23:46.730
Let me show you.

24:00.280 --> 24:02.362
No, I need more.

24:05.040 --> 24:06.530
- You get 'em?
- Yeah.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.882
They were in Curtis' office.
Right where you said they'd be.

24:09.040 --> 24:11.247
Uh, no pun unintended.

24:11.400 --> 24:14.449
This is like that thing from that, uh...
That Jodie Foster movie.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.971
<i>Yeah. Uh, Panic Room?</i>

24:16.120 --> 24:17.360
It's actually more like a lair.
Decommissioned.

24:17.560 --> 24:18.641
But if we can get
the board members in there,

24:18.800 --> 24:20.040
they can escape through a secret exit.

24:20.200 --> 24:21.361
Secret exit?

24:21.720 --> 24:24.883
Um, don't you think you should
have thought of that, like,

24:25.040 --> 24:26.485
I don't know, 15 minutes ago?

24:26.640 --> 24:28.642
Oh, I'm sorry,
I was busy trying not to die.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.290
And you were talking, talking, talking.

24:30.440 --> 24:31.965
Well, you don't open up to me, hon.

24:32.120 --> 24:35.408
I have to force your feelings out of you
sometimes like...

24:35.560 --> 24:37.324
- Like a pistachio.
- Okay, Smoaks.

24:37.480 --> 24:39.084
We gotta go. Come on.

24:41.400 --> 24:42.765
- Felicity...
- Mom.

24:42.960 --> 24:45.440
No, I meant... Felicity!

24:50.320 --> 24:52.004
Okay, we're moving...

24:52.160 --> 24:53.241
I know. Hold on to something.

24:53.400 --> 24:54.686
- What? Why?
- Why?

24:54.840 --> 24:56.683
This elevator,
it only stops at the sub-level

24:56.840 --> 24:58.604
and we need to stop it at...

25:00.680 --> 25:03.411
Conference room floor.

25:03.760 --> 25:04.807
Oh...

25:05.000 --> 25:07.162
- I think we missed our stop.
- No, this is right.

25:07.320 --> 25:09.368
Like I said,
the elevator doesn't stop at this level.

25:09.520 --> 25:12.091
What? Um, honey,
I think this is a concrete wall.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.089
Yeah, and these are explosive devices.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.203
Actually, they're autonomous
communication devices.

25:16.360 --> 25:18.124
I'm just really hoping that
Curtis hasn't figured out

25:18.280 --> 25:19.850
how to stop them from exploding yet.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.321
- Okay.
- Be careful.

25:24.520 --> 25:25.965
Oh, my God. They're gonna blow.

25:26.120 --> 25:27.451
- Okay.
- Oh, God!

25:36.480 --> 25:39.051
Okay, who wants to go on
a secret elevator ride down to the, um...

25:39.200 --> 25:41.009
- Panic room.
- Yeah, the panic room.

25:41.160 --> 25:42.969
Come on.

25:43.120 --> 25:44.281
Come on.

25:45.120 --> 25:46.963
Trying to escape the hive?

25:50.480 --> 25:51.561
Keep them safe.

25:51.720 --> 25:53.848
Huh? What?

26:01.400 --> 26:03.323
Beautiful creatures, my bees.

26:03.480 --> 26:05.482
- They obey you?
- Neural implants.

26:05.640 --> 26:08.371
You used to control them
the old-fashioned way.

26:09.360 --> 26:11.010
How did you know that?

26:11.840 --> 26:13.205
Lucky guess, I guess.

26:13.360 --> 26:17.046
So why bees? Why not an obsession
with flying squirrels?

26:17.240 --> 26:20.767
Squirrels aren't dying off
at a rate of 30% per year.

26:21.240 --> 26:24.323
And nobody cares,
but bees are essential to life.

26:24.560 --> 26:28.531
We're all connected.
The world is one giant honeycomb.

26:28.760 --> 26:30.250
Kumbaya might have
a little more credibility

26:30.440 --> 26:32.044
if you weren't threatening people's lives.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.009
What, you mean like this?

26:34.360 --> 26:37.682
I am running out of patience,
and your friend is running out of time.

26:37.840 --> 26:39.569
Now give me the damn...

26:44.360 --> 26:46.044
That was embarrassing.

26:49.200 --> 26:51.362
I have a tumor on my L4 vertebrae.

26:52.360 --> 26:55.523
The tricky little guy's wrapped
around my spinal cord.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.602
The only way to cut it out
involves a surgery

26:58.800 --> 27:02.282
that will leave me paralyzed
from the waist down.

27:03.440 --> 27:06.762
All the bees in the world couldn't
get a cripple to walk.

27:08.040 --> 27:10.566
And then I read about your miracle chip.

27:10.800 --> 27:12.962
Of course...
I couldn't afford it.

27:13.120 --> 27:14.246
Maybe if you asked nicely...

27:14.440 --> 27:18.126
I want the microchip specs or your friend
relives my favorite scene from My Girl.

27:18.320 --> 27:23.406
Okay, honey, we all have a sad sob story,
but killing people doesn't fix anything.

27:23.720 --> 27:27.281
The blueprints are on a remote hard drive
in Curtis Holt's lab.

27:28.160 --> 27:29.730
You are a smart girl.

27:36.160 --> 27:40.324
Elastic nanotubes, ultrasonic motors,
piezo ceramic elements...

27:40.560 --> 27:42.130
I mean, this bee's got everything.

27:42.280 --> 27:43.770
That was inside me?

27:43.920 --> 27:46.605
Well, that and thousands of its
microscopic larvae.

27:46.760 --> 27:49.127
Don't worry. Should pass in a few days.

27:49.400 --> 27:50.606
Can't wait.

27:50.800 --> 27:52.245
Donna and the others made it out.

27:52.440 --> 27:54.442
- Thea and Felicity?
- They're still inside.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.250
Well, at least now we know
this stops the bees.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.602
I wish it was that simple, but now
that we've played that card,

27:58.760 --> 28:00.649
they've undoubtedly adapted to it.

28:00.800 --> 28:03.770
But we just beat a group of robot bees
using a superhero doohickey,

28:03.920 --> 28:05.524
and if that's not high-five worthy,
I don't know what is.

28:05.680 --> 28:08.445
Curtis.
Now is not the time for high fives.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.960
Sorry.
I, you know, just got excited and...

28:12.120 --> 28:14.043
You know, you gotta celebrate the wins
when they come.

28:14.200 --> 28:15.281
What?

28:16.360 --> 28:18.328
Thea and Felicity are still trapped
inside Palmer Tech

28:18.480 --> 28:19.641
with who knows how many more bees.

28:19.840 --> 28:20.887
- We're not winning.
- Oliver...

28:21.040 --> 28:23.008
So, if you're gonna be down here,
if you're gonna be with us,

28:23.160 --> 28:26.164
then you need to understand the totality
of what it is you're signing up for.

28:26.320 --> 28:29.449
If we do not do our jobs perfectly,
then people die!

28:29.680 --> 28:32.684
And not just strangers but friends,
family and loved ones!

28:32.840 --> 28:35.161
So think about that every time
you crack a joke

28:35.320 --> 28:38.051
- or make light of what it is that we do!
<i>- Hey!</i>

28:39.520 --> 28:41.568
Can I talk to you for a second?

28:47.400 --> 28:49.687
Any puppies you wanna kick
while you're at it?

28:49.840 --> 28:52.730
Bags of kittens that you wanna
throw down the river?

28:52.880 --> 28:54.041
He needed to hear that.

28:54.200 --> 28:56.362
Nobody needs to hear that, Oliver.

28:56.880 --> 28:58.689
I know you're hurting, but you can't
take it out on Curtis.

28:58.880 --> 29:02.043
I'm not taking it out on Curtis
I just need him to see.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.846
- See what?
- That this is not a good life.

29:05.720 --> 29:07.370
I walked away from it.

29:07.920 --> 29:09.331
And I was happy.

29:10.480 --> 29:12.209
For the first time in

29:13.560 --> 29:14.721
eight years,

29:15.880 --> 29:17.166
I was content.

29:17.920 --> 29:21.402
- So why did you come back?
- I came back because of Felicity.

29:21.560 --> 29:23.449
She convinced me that
we could do this job,

29:23.600 --> 29:26.001
that we could save the city, and not...

29:26.520 --> 29:28.568
Surrender to the darkness but...

29:31.120 --> 29:33.691
I don't... I don't think that we can.

29:34.200 --> 29:38.569
You're only saying that right now because
you're in 10 different kinds of pain.

29:39.040 --> 29:41.407
But the harsh truth is that Felicity,

29:42.240 --> 29:44.971
she broke up with you
because of your choices.

29:45.400 --> 29:48.449
Because of the lies that you told.
You, Oliver. Not the Green Arrow.

29:48.640 --> 29:49.687
I know.

29:52.240 --> 29:55.767
It just doesn't seem fair that I can save
a city, and not save my relationship.

29:55.920 --> 29:58.127
Oliver, life's not fair.

29:59.600 --> 30:02.080
Whether you're in Star City or Ivy Town.

30:03.320 --> 30:04.731
But you're right.

30:05.440 --> 30:08.171
You can save this city.
You do it every night.

30:09.440 --> 30:11.602
You're a beacon of hope to people.

30:12.960 --> 30:16.965
I just wish that you would try and use
some of that hope for yourself.

30:29.440 --> 30:30.441
Oh, hi, fellas.

30:30.640 --> 30:33.484
You know, I usually frown upon walk-ins
but how can I help you?

30:33.680 --> 30:37.048
No guards are coming to save you
this time, Darhk. We made sure of it.

30:37.200 --> 30:40.124
Good. Because then he only
has to kill two of you.

30:45.120 --> 30:46.531
I know you're probably asking yourself,

30:46.680 --> 30:49.251
"Self, what the hell just happened?"

30:49.800 --> 30:52.167
it turns out your friend,
my new friend, Mr. Amar,

30:52.320 --> 30:55.130
has a soft spot for his
only surviving relative.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.402
A grandmother in Monument Point.

30:57.800 --> 31:02.010
It is amazing what people will tell you
with a few phone calls and a kind voice.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.400
Anyway, uh...

31:03.600 --> 31:05.011
Are they dead? Are they dead?

31:05.160 --> 31:07.208
No! I had this wonderful speech about how

31:07.360 --> 31:10.762
I was gonna kill your grandmother
had you not killed them...

31:10.920 --> 31:13.002
Never mind. On to other matters.

31:14.160 --> 31:18.324
You many now call your organization
and have that other message delivered.

31:26.160 --> 31:27.730
I thought we were locked out.

31:27.880 --> 31:30.201
Well, we're gonna have to see
if I haven't lost my touch.

31:30.360 --> 31:33.011
And I have to see if my mom
and the board members made it to safety.

31:33.200 --> 31:35.328
You really shouldn't have given
Brie what she wanted.

31:35.480 --> 31:38.211
I'm sick of people being put
in vulnerable positions.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.601
Yeah, well, now there's nothing
stopping her from bringing those

31:40.760 --> 31:41.966
bee things back on us.

31:42.120 --> 31:45.727
Well, at the very least it buys us,
the team... Your team, time.

31:47.240 --> 31:48.890
Ollie's gonna be fine.

31:49.600 --> 31:50.726
He always is.

31:50.880 --> 31:52.689
Well, unfortunately,
in Oliver's case "he always is"

31:52.840 --> 31:55.081
isn't an accurate predictive metric.

31:55.320 --> 31:58.369
I'm sorry. I'm just sick of worrying.
I'm sick of the violence...

31:58.560 --> 32:01.040
Hey, so am I, okay? Of course I am.

32:02.040 --> 32:04.566
But we put up with it, we push past it.

32:05.120 --> 32:07.566
Because what we do is important, okay?

32:07.760 --> 32:09.922
We have to be that beacon of hope.

32:10.800 --> 32:11.926
Nobody else is.

32:12.080 --> 32:13.809
You're the beacon of hope.

32:13.960 --> 32:17.407
I quit the team because I couldn't
stand to work with Oliver, but...

32:17.560 --> 32:20.609
But now that I'm out, I look at life from
a different perspective.

32:20.760 --> 32:22.489
I mean, look around you.

32:23.000 --> 32:25.321
Thea, we're in a Die <i>Hard</i> movie with bees.

32:25.480 --> 32:30.042
Maybe I'm meant for great things, maybe
I'm not but whatever it is, it's not this.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.807
I'm sorry. I'm not coming back.

32:36.240 --> 32:37.321
Curtis...

32:38.440 --> 32:42.286
You know, I'm beginning to see why
you and Felicity didn't work out.

32:42.840 --> 32:44.001
Probably deserve that.

32:44.160 --> 32:47.562
Look, I'm all for hugs and learning
but, like you said, there's still danger.

32:47.720 --> 32:48.767
Yeah.

32:48.920 --> 32:50.888
And you are a very scary man.

32:51.040 --> 32:53.088
<i>Any luck with the bees?</i>

32:53.280 --> 32:54.281
Curtis is doing his best.

32:54.440 --> 32:55.726
Thanks, Laurel.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.723
Now that I've been able to actually
examine the bee,

32:57.880 --> 32:59.928
I've deciphered their upgrade protocol.

33:00.120 --> 33:02.009
The next time they adapt,
I can upload a virus

33:02.160 --> 33:03.605
that will disperse into the entire hive.

33:03.760 --> 33:06.445
Like what <i>they did in
Independence Day, right?</i>

33:06.600 --> 33:07.806
What? I can't watch movies too?

33:08.000 --> 33:09.490
So what's the plan?

33:09.720 --> 33:12.644
I rigged an arrow with
a computer virus payload.

33:12.880 --> 33:14.484
Shoot it near one of Bee Arthur's minions,

33:14.680 --> 33:18.321
the virus will transmit to the rest
of the colony and we're done.

33:19.120 --> 33:20.565
That's nice work.

33:20.960 --> 33:22.450
Uh...

33:23.320 --> 33:25.322
Wait until it works before
you congratulate me.

33:25.520 --> 33:28.649
I'm in. I mean, I'm out.
I mean, I have Internet.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.802
- Mom and the board members, they're okay.
- What about us?

33:30.960 --> 33:32.007
I'm working on overriding the bees,

33:32.160 --> 33:33.446
the ones that are outside
guarding the building.

33:33.600 --> 33:35.090
<i>Don't bother.</i>

33:38.520 --> 33:40.966
These blueprints will be useful.
Thanks for those.

33:41.160 --> 33:43.686
You have what you want.
So go build it yourself!

33:43.840 --> 33:45.569
I think we're confused.

33:45.720 --> 33:49.611
To get the schematics, I had to tip-toe
through Palmer Tech's computer network.

33:49.760 --> 33:53.367
And I saw some
very familiar computer code.

33:54.400 --> 33:57.404
You never forget the hacker
who sent you to prison.

33:58.360 --> 33:59.407
Hi...

34:04.640 --> 34:05.641
We're clear.

34:05.800 --> 34:07.165
At least
there's no signs of the bees.

34:12.560 --> 34:13.607
Go!

34:19.960 --> 34:23.089
Looks like your green friend
didn't forget about you.

34:26.280 --> 34:27.520
Never will.

34:29.000 --> 34:30.489
- Hey, are you hurt?
- I'm okay.

34:30.639 --> 34:31.880
Hey! Behind you!

34:34.560 --> 34:36.324
There you go. Team Arrow,

34:36.520 --> 34:38.362
which I am now a member of, pinch me,

34:38.520 --> 34:42.605
I need a few more minutes to hack this
latest firewall the bees adapted.

34:46.719 --> 34:48.882
I thought you were a better shot.

35:06.360 --> 35:08.601
Come on. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

35:08.760 --> 35:09.966
Got you.

35:10.200 --> 35:11.440
Nice.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.329
What is that?

36:07.120 --> 36:08.360
Ew!

36:08.800 --> 36:10.802
Don't worry, I won't tell
anyone you screamed.

36:10.960 --> 36:12.530
Oh, right.

36:20.800 --> 36:21.961
Thank you.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.964
You never, never have to thank me.

36:29.200 --> 36:31.726
If I can't walk, you can't live.

36:37.160 --> 36:40.767
Who should I kill first? A or "bee"?

36:42.960 --> 36:44.724
<i>Guess who's back in control?</i>

36:44.880 --> 36:48.282
It's me, Curtis. In case you guys
don't recognize my voice yet.

36:48.440 --> 36:50.966
No. No, no.

36:56.600 --> 37:00.207
Lay down, bee-yotch.

37:02.520 --> 37:03.885
Too on the nose?

37:16.880 --> 37:18.405
The bee came alive and, well,

37:18.560 --> 37:21.325
things got a little out of hand.
But don't worry, it's dead now.

37:21.480 --> 37:23.847
You did good, Curtis. And I'm...

37:24.760 --> 37:27.286
I'm sorry if I made you feel differently.

37:28.040 --> 37:30.611
Thanks, GA.
You mind if I call you GA?

37:30.760 --> 37:32.808
All right, yeah, I'll just stick
to Oliver then.

37:32.960 --> 37:35.964
Or Mr. Queen. What about Larvan?
What's gonna happen to her?

37:36.120 --> 37:38.646
She's at Starling General.
Overdosed on toxins from the bees

37:38.800 --> 37:40.165
and is in some sort of a coma.

37:40.360 --> 37:43.762
More importantly, she's no longer
holding a dozen innocent hostages.

37:43.920 --> 37:46.287
That's both comforting and horrifying
at the same time.

37:46.440 --> 37:47.965
Welcome to our world.

37:48.160 --> 37:49.241
Hey...

37:49.440 --> 37:51.169
ls everything all right?

37:51.320 --> 37:54.085
Yeah, you know, I should probably
just head home.

37:54.240 --> 37:56.242
You know, learning that
you are, you know, you

37:56.400 --> 37:58.687
and the murderous bees,
and this coma news...

37:58.880 --> 38:00.370
It's just a lot to digest.

38:00.520 --> 38:02.727
Plus the IV you guys gave me
is starting to wear off.

38:02.920 --> 38:05.366
Well, you are always welcome here, Curtis.

38:05.520 --> 38:09.161
Just keep the property damage to
a minimum next time.

38:09.560 --> 38:11.369
- Okay.
- All right.

38:12.400 --> 38:13.640
- What's the exit?
- Right there.

38:13.800 --> 38:15.564
On, yeah.

38:18.200 --> 38:20.601
Hey. Nice apology.

38:20.800 --> 38:23.770
Well, I'm just trying to
be a beacon of hope.

38:24.640 --> 38:28.122
And like you said, save a little bit
of that hope for myself.

38:33.080 --> 38:35.003
Taiana. Hey, hey.

38:36.320 --> 38:37.560
All right. All right. Hey, Jesus.

38:37.720 --> 38:39.290
Come on, come on.

38:39.680 --> 38:42.365
Oh, thank God. Hey, Taiana, wake up. Hey.

38:42.600 --> 38:43.806
Oliver...

38:44.280 --> 38:45.770
It's okay. You're okay...

38:45.920 --> 38:47.046
- No.
- It's all right.

38:47.200 --> 38:48.565
No, Reiter...

38:49.320 --> 38:50.446
He's gone.

38:51.480 --> 38:54.131
He must be in the tunnels
searching for his idol.

38:54.280 --> 38:55.441
We can't let him find it.

38:55.640 --> 38:57.608
If he's in the tunnels,
searching for his idol,

38:57.760 --> 39:00.127
that means he's not going to the prison.

39:00.280 --> 39:02.169
This our chance to save your friends.

39:02.360 --> 39:04.089
And what of Reiter's men?

39:04.360 --> 39:06.044
They are still up there.

39:10.680 --> 39:13.411
That's why we're gonna
kill all of them first.

39:20.760 --> 39:23.684
I don't suppose it's too late
to reheat that soup?

39:24.840 --> 39:27.605
Where have you been? You bolted
out of here like a crazy person.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.724
Like some kind of a superhero
off to save the day.

39:30.920 --> 39:34.367
I was chasing some silly fantasy
that I can help the police.

39:34.600 --> 39:38.400
It was scary and thrilling and
dangerous and... Did I mention scary?

39:38.920 --> 39:41.764
The... The point is, is that I saw enough

39:41.960 --> 39:45.407
to know that this is where I belong.

39:46.320 --> 39:47.970
At home, with you.

39:49.160 --> 39:51.128
So no more disappearing acts?

39:51.440 --> 39:53.681
I promise.

39:54.000 --> 39:56.128
Let's get you some of that soup.

39:58.880 --> 40:00.450
Terrific.

40:00.760 --> 40:04.367
Maybe I should burn
some incense in here or something.

40:05.000 --> 40:07.241
Probably a very good idea.

40:07.440 --> 40:10.649
Remind me to never wear
black and yellow ever again.

40:12.480 --> 40:13.766
Wait, where'd your mom go?

40:13.920 --> 40:15.285
Oh, Captain Lance drove her home.

40:15.440 --> 40:17.807
Yeah, that is something I'll never
be able to wrap my brain around.

40:17.960 --> 40:20.122
Kinda cute.

40:21.760 --> 40:23.285
Don't you miss this?

40:24.000 --> 40:28.210
I mean, I... I know you said that you
wanted to get away from it all but...

40:29.160 --> 40:30.446
How could you?

40:31.000 --> 40:32.047
What do you mean?

40:32.240 --> 40:34.720
This. The thrill of this. The rush.

40:34.920 --> 40:38.527
I mean, we just took down
a bad "bee-yotch" tonight.

40:38.680 --> 40:40.250
It doesn't get any better than this.

40:40.400 --> 40:42.243
I was never in it for that.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.441
Not ever.

40:46.240 --> 40:48.242
I wanted to make a difference.

40:48.480 --> 40:51.131
Be part of that
beacon of hope you speak of.

40:51.440 --> 40:52.726
So come back.

40:53.600 --> 40:55.011
Rejoin the team.

40:56.040 --> 40:58.202
I think I figured out another way.

40:58.880 --> 41:03.044
It's actually that insane bee lady
who gave me the idea. Ironically.

41:05.440 --> 41:07.124
To remake this company.

41:07.880 --> 41:09.405
To use the technology that
helped me walk again

41:09.560 --> 41:11.562
to make people's lives better.

41:11.880 --> 41:15.282
To make Palmer Tech
into the beacon of hope.

41:21.280 --> 41:25.683
Our mutual friends in HIVE have abandoned
our other mutual friend Mr. Darhk.

41:26.920 --> 41:28.649
But he reached out to me.

41:29.320 --> 41:30.810
Told me about you.

41:31.520 --> 41:35.570
He said you were his ace in the hole.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.806
Is that what you'd like me to call you?

41:39.760 --> 41:42.240
Or do you prefer Mr. Diggle?

42:15.840 --> 42:16.841
English - SDH
