[rubble crashing]

02:25.937 --> 02:27.230
What's all this, then?

02:27.772 --> 02:29.190
[creaking]

03:12.317 --> 03:14.527
[woman in mine] No!

[crying out]

03:22.535 --> 03:24.537
[instrumental theme music plays]

04:26.474 --> 04:29.227
Seems me and you keep meeting
in funeral parlors.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.522
The name's John Cook.

04:33.481 --> 04:34.607
He's from Santa Fe.

04:36.442 --> 04:37.860
You can send the body there.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.417
You just let Griffin ride into town?

04:53.042 --> 04:54.043
I did.

04:55.253 --> 04:57.380
And then I just let him ride on out.

05:00.383 --> 05:03.970
You take a shot at Frank Griffin
and his men, you best kill 'em all.

05:05.346 --> 05:09.309
Something the poor folks at Creede
learned, to their sad experience.

05:09.934 --> 05:12.812
Where's the army regiment
that's supposed to be here?

05:12.895 --> 05:13.896
Wyoming.

05:14.480 --> 05:15.940
Up around Laramie.

05:16.733 --> 05:18.192
On range business.

05:26.576 --> 05:27.994
What was I supposed to do?

05:36.461 --> 05:37.545
Well, for starters...

05:38.212 --> 05:39.255
you can sober up.

05:44.218 --> 05:47.764
If you don't mind my asking, Sheriff,
what all's your strategy, huh?

05:49.390 --> 05:50.892
I don't rightly know.

05:52.643 --> 05:56.272
I just want to get a rope around the man's
neck before he does any more damage.

06:02.528 --> 06:03.988
Where's the marshal's badge?

06:08.451 --> 06:10.244
Where's his goddamn badge?

06:18.002 --> 06:19.629
[horse whinnies]

06:27.678 --> 06:30.598
Some places just got
that dark look about them.

06:35.812 --> 06:36.813
[driver yells]

06:40.608 --> 06:42.235

06:48.366 --> 06:50.368
[indistinct chattering]

07:13.224 --> 07:15.893
[Gatz] What do you suppose
they got inside that drum?

07:16.894 --> 07:17.728
Water.

08:41.812 --> 08:43.940
[Daryl] What the fuckity-fuck?

08:44.023 --> 08:45.608
Do not come in here.

08:47.401 --> 08:49.320
[woman]
You best not linger yourself, Pastor.

08:49.403 --> 08:51.405
[old woman wheezes]

08:55.493 --> 08:56.702
What's your name, child?

08:58.829 --> 08:59.872
Lila.

09:01.123 --> 09:02.750
How long you been here, Lila?

09:07.755 --> 09:08.756
Well...

09:10.716 --> 09:14.762
I... brought my mama and papa here
about a month ago.

09:17.473 --> 09:20.393
Then my sister, maybe a week later.

09:20.893 --> 09:21.894
Then I come.

09:25.439 --> 09:26.941
Your people all gone?

09:29.151 --> 09:32.697
So you're giving these folks comfort
all on your own?

09:34.198 --> 09:35.700
Doctor can't keep up.

09:36.909 --> 09:37.952
And where be he?

09:40.121 --> 09:41.330
[man wheezing]

09:43.332 --> 09:44.542
[flies buzzing]

09:49.255 --> 09:51.757
-There a town nearby?
-There was.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.843
All of them got the pox?

09:53.926 --> 09:55.052
Most everybody.

09:55.136 --> 09:57.138
We buried nine just last week.

09:58.639 --> 10:02.643
Sammy passed yesterday, but I don't got
the strength to move him out.

10:03.185 --> 10:06.689
There was a little girl who came in
two days ago with her mama, but...

10:07.523 --> 10:08.899
I can't find her now.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.614
Could you at least say a prayer for us
before you go?

10:18.659 --> 10:20.244
I ain't leaving you, child.

10:31.005 --> 10:32.006
[sighs]

10:32.089 --> 10:33.090
[sniffs]

10:35.801 --> 10:39.221
I reckon maybe we should
burn this place down.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.099
Put them poor folks out of their misery.

10:42.183 --> 10:43.893
Is that what you'd do, is it, son?

10:44.560 --> 10:46.187
It would be the Christian thing.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.689
Stop the pox before anybody else gets it.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.775
Why not just shoot them?

10:51.275 --> 10:54.320
Well, I'd probably do that first...

10:55.071 --> 10:56.572
so they don't feel no fire on them.

10:58.616 --> 10:59.617
[sighs]

11:02.453 --> 11:06.499
Take the boys ahead and make camp at the
river. I'm gonna stay here a little while.

11:06.582 --> 11:10.294
You go back into that sick house, Frank,
there's a good chance you don't come out.

11:10.378 --> 11:11.962
Don't worry none about me.

11:12.046 --> 11:15.549
-I ain't gonna die of no smallpox.
-What if it's worse than that?

11:16.675 --> 11:17.927
Could be lepers in there.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.763
I ain't gonna die of no leprosy, neither.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.848
I already done seen what's gonna get me,

11:22.932 --> 11:25.643
and it ain't no sickness of any kind,
so, go on now.

11:26.602 --> 11:28.229
I'll be back around suppertime.

11:29.814 --> 11:31.232
I could sure eat something.

11:38.948 --> 11:39.990
[grunts]

11:40.074 --> 11:42.326
Not you two. You two stay here with me.

11:44.328 --> 11:46.956
Gatz, take off that fucking badge.

11:49.750 --> 11:50.751
Howdy.

11:59.885 --> 12:00.886
Ma'am.

12:00.970 --> 12:02.596
[chickens clucking]

12:09.019 --> 12:10.020
Well...

12:11.605 --> 12:12.731
How y'all doing?

12:17.111 --> 12:18.487
My, oh, my.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.004
What can we do for you gentlemen?

12:35.504 --> 12:39.258
Just out here to pay our respects to...
Corporal John Randall.

12:40.217 --> 12:41.427
We've heard tales.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.679
Had no idea you were so close.

12:44.513 --> 12:45.973
You're quite the legend, sir.

12:47.349 --> 12:50.060
That the only reason you come?
Salute a war hero?

12:50.144 --> 12:51.145
No, sir.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.189
We came out here also to let you know

12:53.272 --> 12:55.858
that the La Belle claim
has recently been bought out

12:55.941 --> 12:59.361
by the Quicksilver Mining Syndicate,
and we're gonna be starting up again soon.

13:00.446 --> 13:05.201
Now, I know there's no love lost
between you and the folks of La Belle.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.328
It was the mine poisoned our water.

13:07.912 --> 13:11.207
Only since it's been dead we got a chance
to grow something out here.

13:11.290 --> 13:13.292
[chicken clucking]

13:14.543 --> 13:16.045
Just barely, I'd say.

13:16.921 --> 13:18.422
These rains been helping some.

13:18.506 --> 13:19.924
Rain is unpredictable.

13:20.007 --> 13:21.800
But the Quicksilver folks will be willing

13:21.884 --> 13:24.929
to divert some water from the La Belle
River and give you all rights to it.

13:25.012 --> 13:26.180
At what cost?

13:26.263 --> 13:28.224
At the cost you just keep to yourselves.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.267
We've been doing just that.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.435
That you have,

13:31.519 --> 13:35.147
but one or two of them ladies
might get it in their heads

13:35.231 --> 13:36.815
to come out here and ask for help.

13:36.899 --> 13:40.152
Maybe look for some brave men
to back them up.

13:40.236 --> 13:42.404
Maybe offer to make them partners.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.407
We don't owe them folks nothing.

13:46.116 --> 13:49.745
We tell them the mine is poisoning
our land, they don't do boo about it.

13:50.287 --> 13:51.747
Leave us to die out here.

13:52.081 --> 13:53.499
That's just who they are.

13:54.124 --> 13:56.126
And you best remember that,

13:56.210 --> 13:58.045
otherwise you could lose your land...

13:58.963 --> 14:00.422
be forced to move on.

14:00.506 --> 14:04.009
And that, sir, would be a damn shame
after all your hard work.

14:06.220 --> 14:08.055
That a threat from the mining folks?

14:08.639 --> 14:11.225
That ain't no threat,
it's a damn near guarantee.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.811
Statehood, it's coming.

14:14.436 --> 14:17.106
All sorts of new laws come along with it.

14:17.606 --> 14:19.108
Like they done in other places,

14:19.191 --> 14:22.444
some of them laws
ain't gonna be as friendly to you all,

14:22.528 --> 14:23.696
war heroes or not.

14:24.530 --> 14:26.532
Now, I know I'm looking at free men.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.701
You fought for your country.

14:29.159 --> 14:30.953
You earned the right to be here,

14:31.036 --> 14:33.205
but not everyone sees it that way.

14:34.790 --> 14:36.667
But them Quicksilver folks do?

14:37.293 --> 14:39.712
Mister, I promise you,

14:40.254 --> 14:43.257
if you do as I say,
just mind your own business...

14:43.340 --> 14:44.550
we'll look after you.

14:45.342 --> 14:47.803
Once again, it's a real honor, sir.

14:48.762 --> 14:49.763
Come on.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.231
Don't see why we gotta stay here...

14:59.815 --> 15:02.902
and risk getting ourselves eaten up
by some horrible disease.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.278
It ain't fair.

15:04.820 --> 15:09.283
Maybe, if you hadn't opened
your damn mouth about shooting them all...

15:10.409 --> 15:12.536
You don't think that's what he's gonna do?

15:13.495 --> 15:15.831
He's gonna let them think
he's here to minister,

15:15.915 --> 15:18.500
but me and you both know,
as soon as he gets tired of it,

15:18.584 --> 15:19.835
he's gonna "save" them.

15:25.591 --> 15:26.592
Pow!

15:26.675 --> 15:28.177
"I save you, sir."

15:28.677 --> 15:29.887
[both laugh]

15:31.221 --> 15:32.097
Pow!

15:32.181 --> 15:33.557
"I save you, ma'am."

15:36.518 --> 15:37.519
Pow!

15:38.812 --> 15:40.147
[laughs] "I save you all."

15:41.482 --> 15:42.399
Pow!

15:42.691 --> 15:43.817
Pow!

15:43.901 --> 15:45.027
"I save you all!"

15:45.110 --> 15:46.737
[Devlins laugh]

15:53.369 --> 15:55.371
[Devlins chatter and laugh]

16:13.222 --> 16:16.767
We can wash these folks for now, but we're
gonna have to boil all their clothes.

16:17.267 --> 16:18.394
Blankets, too.

16:21.939 --> 16:22.940
[Donnie] Pow!

16:23.023 --> 16:24.858
[Devlins laugh]

16:28.070 --> 16:29.071
Excuse me.

16:36.078 --> 16:37.746
You should clean yourself as well.

16:38.247 --> 16:39.665
[door opening]

16:43.293 --> 16:44.294
[grunts]

16:45.170 --> 16:46.463
That's enough chopping.

16:47.089 --> 16:49.383
Let's get. I'm hungry.

16:53.679 --> 16:56.849
I need you to go down to that creek
we passed, fill that up.

16:57.433 --> 16:58.475
Yes, sir.

16:59.309 --> 17:01.645
Then I need you
to start digging some graves.

17:01.729 --> 17:04.148
Some of these folks
ain't gonna last past supper.

17:04.231 --> 17:05.691
Speaking of supper...

17:05.774 --> 17:08.068
You can probably find some shovels
in the barn.

17:09.862 --> 17:12.031
And if we don't find any?

17:13.198 --> 17:14.450
Use your hands.

17:34.928 --> 17:35.929
[gasps]

17:38.682 --> 17:40.059
I see you have stock out back

17:40.142 --> 17:42.352
and they don't look like
they've been lately fed.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.437
I'll tend to them.

17:45.355 --> 17:48.192
If it's all right with you,
I'll kill one or two of your chickens...

17:48.275 --> 17:49.276
[sniffs]

17:49.359 --> 17:51.737
...so you can make a broth
for these folks.

17:53.906 --> 17:55.699
-I'll help.
-I can do it. You...

17:56.492 --> 17:57.576
Stay near the fire.

17:59.995 --> 18:00.996
Preacher.

18:03.665 --> 18:05.334
It's been a long time

18:05.417 --> 18:08.420
since anyone's shown
any real kindness around here.

18:28.690 --> 18:30.692
[thunder rumbles]

18:32.361 --> 18:33.487
[Roy] A norther.

18:34.113 --> 18:35.531
Big one, looks like.

18:37.866 --> 18:38.951
It's getting late.

18:39.743 --> 18:41.745
Yes, ma'am. Good night, boy.

18:43.872 --> 18:44.915
You wear him out.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.713
Do you mind if,
one of these days, I take him hunting?

18:52.756 --> 18:54.591
I'd only keep him out for a night or two.

18:54.675 --> 18:57.594
Just seems like a thing
the boy should know how to do by now.

18:59.471 --> 19:00.764
I think he'd like that.

19:00.848 --> 19:02.516
[thunder rumbles]

19:02.599 --> 19:03.684
All right, then.

19:04.726 --> 19:05.978
Good night, ma'am.

19:06.061 --> 19:07.062
Good night.

[Iyovi speaks in Paiute]

19:11.316 --> 19:13.235
Sweet dreams to you, too, Grandma.

19:16.280 --> 19:18.657
She's not here. Must be at my place.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.034
[thunder rumbles]

19:21.785 --> 19:22.953
I'll be right back.

20:21.845 --> 20:22.971
[Mary-Agnes] Whitey?

20:24.723 --> 20:25.891
Evening, Maggie.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.936
What are you traipsing around
in the dark for?

20:30.437 --> 20:31.897
I was just going for a ride.

20:32.648 --> 20:33.649
Now?

20:34.233 --> 20:35.234
Yeah.

20:35.317 --> 20:38.153
Well, why not?
I mean, you're out here, ain't you?

20:51.208 --> 20:53.835
Well, we best both get inside
before the rain hits.

20:54.962 --> 20:55.963
Yeah.

21:00.300 --> 21:01.301
All right.

[gunshot echoes]

24:16.913 --> 24:18.331
[whimpers]

24:25.672 --> 24:27.215
You're gonna be all right now, ma'am.

24:37.350 --> 24:38.351
[Alice gasps]

24:56.286 --> 24:57.287
Bill?

24:58.496 --> 25:00.373
We have to get these people out of here.

26:31.172 --> 26:33.341

27:26.853 --> 27:27.854
[buzzing stops]

27:31.316 --> 27:32.400
They're moving south.

27:34.235 --> 27:35.737
But they keep to the river.

27:36.488 --> 27:38.114
[buzzing]

27:39.616 --> 27:41.493
So even with 30 horses,

27:41.576 --> 27:43.411
they will still be hard to follow.

27:45.038 --> 27:46.456
Bee tell you all that?

27:49.334 --> 27:50.752
Are you following me?

27:52.295 --> 27:53.129
No.

27:54.089 --> 27:55.840
You just happen to be heading my way?

28:01.096 --> 28:02.263
Stupid Indian.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.100
Filthy dog.

28:11.231 --> 28:12.232
Well...

28:15.068 --> 28:16.986
if you lose me, I'm heading south.

28:17.904 --> 28:19.781
But I'm sure a bee can tell you that.

28:23.034 --> 28:25.036
[thunder rumbles]

28:46.891 --> 28:49.477
That mud out there is absolutely...

28:50.145 --> 28:51.146
without bottom.

28:52.272 --> 28:53.314
[Grigg chuckles]

28:56.151 --> 28:58.278
By chance, is your livery man about?

28:59.028 --> 29:00.280
That would be me.

29:00.363 --> 29:01.364
[Grigg] Ah.

29:02.657 --> 29:04.451
Well, if you would be so kind.

29:05.785 --> 29:07.954
[chuckles] It's, uh, just outside there.

29:08.037 --> 29:10.039
[laughs]

29:10.123 --> 29:11.541
[bangs feet]

29:12.333 --> 29:13.960
A glass of beer, barkeep.

29:21.217 --> 29:22.218
Phew!

The three war causes in the West.

29:40.069 --> 29:41.070
[sighs]

29:41.154 --> 29:42.405
My name is Grigg.

29:43.364 --> 29:45.200
And I'm here to inquire about your law.

29:47.494 --> 29:48.703
-Our law?
-[Grigg] Mm.

29:49.204 --> 29:52.415
Seems the man's repute's
been whispered all the way to Taos.

29:52.916 --> 29:55.168
Jesus Christ! A.T. Grigg?

29:56.753 --> 29:57.587
[chuckles]

29:58.087 --> 30:02.842
Sir, it is a pleasure to meet you. My name
is Whitey Winn. Deputy Whitey Winn.

30:02.926 --> 30:05.428
I figured it was only a matter of time
before you looked for me.

30:05.512 --> 30:07.597
In fact, I am not looking for you, son,

30:07.680 --> 30:09.808
and I would appreciate
you taking a step back

30:09.891 --> 30:12.519
before whatever you've got
gets communicable.

30:13.770 --> 30:15.438
I'm asking after Bill McNue.

30:15.522 --> 30:16.523
McNue?

30:17.148 --> 30:19.150
[Grigg] The first lawman
ever to capture...

30:20.401 --> 30:21.778
the notorious Roy Goode.

30:22.779 --> 30:25.114
I don't know
who you've been talking to, but...

30:26.115 --> 30:28.618
Bill McNue
certainly didn't capture this man.

30:30.161 --> 30:31.496
Well, where is Sheriff McNue?

30:31.579 --> 30:33.832
Because I would still love
to speak with him.

30:33.915 --> 30:36.042
Who knows where the man goes these days?

30:36.835 --> 30:38.461
[Grigg] Now, what do you mean, sir?

30:39.045 --> 30:40.046
[Asa] He's a coward.

30:40.547 --> 30:43.508
And you can print
that Asa Leopold said such.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.677
Perhaps one of you...

30:47.011 --> 30:48.304
can make sense of this.

30:49.514 --> 30:50.640
[slides paper]

30:52.934 --> 30:54.269
"To Marshal John Cook.

30:54.352 --> 30:56.354

Will meet up in Olegrande."

31:01.734 --> 31:04.070
Sir, I smell a rodent.

31:04.153 --> 31:06.114
Someone is trying to fool you.

31:06.781 --> 31:08.491
Well, it wouldn't be the first time.

31:09.409 --> 31:11.619
Well, so that my trip is not a total loss,

31:11.703 --> 31:16.332
why don't you all tell me about
this part of the world I just rode into?

31:16.416 --> 31:19.419
[chuckles] You can start by explaining
where the hell everybody went.

31:20.545 --> 31:21.588
Mine took them.

31:21.671 --> 31:23.172
Eighty-three in one go.

31:25.216 --> 31:26.217
All of them?

31:26.885 --> 31:28.344
Present company excepted.

31:29.679 --> 31:30.513
Huh.

31:32.891 --> 31:33.892
Well...

31:34.559 --> 31:37.437
then aside from you fine gentlemen,

31:37.520 --> 31:38.521
who all is left?

31:40.148 --> 31:41.149
Just the women.

31:43.484 --> 31:44.485
Really?

31:46.946 --> 31:47.947
Just the women?

31:48.031 --> 31:49.657

31:51.034 --> 31:54.203
-How are we supposed to hunt in the rain?
-It's just water.

31:54.913 --> 31:56.122
You ain't gonna melt.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.249
And it will be gone by noon.

31:58.333 --> 32:01.920
All the game will be out by then,
taking in the sunshine, waiting on us.

32:02.003 --> 32:03.296
Waiting on us to kill them?

32:04.005 --> 32:05.673
That's the basic idea of hunting.

32:06.883 --> 32:09.719
There's lunch in there.
Probably enough for dinner, too.

32:09.802 --> 32:10.970
Oh, thank you, ma'am.

32:11.638 --> 32:13.222
[thunder rumbles]

32:14.140 --> 32:16.684
How would you boys feel about
having some company?

32:17.894 --> 32:18.937
It would be just fine.

32:20.480 --> 32:21.481
Wonderful.

32:21.564 --> 32:22.941
[horse nickers]

32:23.024 --> 32:24.025

32:24.525 --> 32:25.610
[Iyovi speaks in Paiute]

32:26.486 --> 32:29.113
[Alice] She hasn't been on a proper hunt
in I don't know how long.

32:30.490 --> 32:31.908
I think it might do her some good.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.452
Also, gives me some peace and quiet.

32:36.537 --> 32:37.538
Good luck, now.

32:40.625 --> 32:42.001
[whistles]

32:44.337 --> 32:45.922
I think she wants to get going.

32:46.965 --> 32:48.174
Yeah, I got that.

33:43.938 --> 33:46.524
What the hell is Granny
going on about back there?

33:46.607 --> 33:48.234
She's singing her hunting song.

33:49.360 --> 33:52.071
Well, she's gonna scare away
all the damn game.

33:53.197 --> 33:55.199
[singing continues]

33:59.704 --> 34:03.541
[Roy] I think we head up onto that ridge
and keep ourselves up-sun

34:03.624 --> 34:05.918
and downwind from whatever's hiding below.

34:07.462 --> 34:08.921
Or we can go that way.

34:21.517 --> 34:22.560
[grunts]

34:46.626 --> 34:47.835
[Roy clears throat]

34:58.721 --> 35:00.014
Just look at him.

35:06.229 --> 35:09.023
Aim for just above the front flank, here.

35:10.274 --> 35:11.609
That's where the heart is.

35:14.112 --> 35:17.657
We don't want to go traipsing
through the woods after a wounded animal.

35:22.370 --> 35:23.996
Now, take a breath and hold it.

35:27.333 --> 35:28.334
That's it.

35:29.460 --> 35:30.670
Now, when you're ready...

35:31.379 --> 35:33.047
just pull the trigger, real slow.

35:37.510 --> 35:38.344
[buck snorts]

35:39.762 --> 35:41.055
Better do it now, boy.

35:52.942 --> 35:54.569
[Iyovi mutters in Paiute]

35:54.652 --> 35:56.320
Maybe we should try some fishing.

36:01.617 --> 36:03.619
[water gushing]

36:13.713 --> 36:16.549
There's a nice pool over there
by them boulders.

36:18.801 --> 36:22.096
Looks like it gets deep pretty quick,
so better stay behind me.

36:25.892 --> 36:26.893
Wait.

36:56.214 --> 36:59.091
Looks like they tried to cross
too soon after the melt.

36:59.717 --> 37:02.428
Thought they would try it here
where it wasn't as wide, but...

37:05.806 --> 37:07.141
But they was wrong.

37:21.864 --> 37:23.157
[Iyovi shrieks]

37:31.040 --> 37:32.291
Interesting woman...

37:33.167 --> 37:34.168
your granny.

37:59.026 --> 38:00.278
Throw me my book, will you?

38:16.961 --> 38:19.797
Someone made that for me
when I weren't much older than you.

38:22.174 --> 38:23.259
[Truckee] Show me tricks?

38:24.010 --> 38:25.553
I don't know any tricks.

38:27.388 --> 38:28.931
I saw you shoot that snake.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.308
That weren't no trick.

38:30.391 --> 38:32.643
I wasn't thinking then, I was just doing.

38:38.566 --> 38:40.693

39:26.739 --> 39:28.991
[boy]  There was a train robber,
once upon a time...

39:30.034 --> 39:32.620
named big Black Jack Ketchum.

39:33.996 --> 39:35.331
[boy] He was a giant fella.

39:35.414 --> 39:37.416
Had to go nearly seven feet

39:37.500 --> 39:40.002
and some 300 pounds.

39:41.170 --> 39:44.507
He was so big, the hangman
had to build an extra-tall scaffold

39:44.590 --> 39:47.635
to make sure his feet didn't hit
the ground when they dropped him.

39:48.010 --> 39:51.555
And when Black Jack dropped,
that extra few feet was just enough

39:51.639 --> 39:54.058
to jerk his damn head
right off his shoulders.

39:54.141 --> 39:55.976
It rolled right onto the platform,

39:56.060 --> 39:58.854
a big grin still on his face.

39:59.563 --> 40:01.148
Something I ain't never gonna forget.

40:02.233 --> 40:03.692
[bird hoots]

40:04.193 --> 40:05.528
And now I ain't, neither.

40:09.031 --> 40:10.032
[twigs snapping]

40:12.118 --> 40:15.579
Stop right there, fucker! Come any closer
and I'll blast your goddamn fucking face!

40:16.330 --> 40:17.957
And he'll fucking do it, too,

40:18.040 --> 40:20.126
you stupid son of a whore!

40:20.209 --> 40:21.836
[woman] Don't shoot!

40:27.591 --> 40:30.261
-Well, now.
-[older boy] I-I'm sorry, ma'am.

40:32.930 --> 40:36.600
We thought you were some sort of jackal
or criminal type, come to take advantage.

40:36.684 --> 40:38.227
Well, you were right to think that.

40:39.562 --> 40:41.814
It can be rather dangerous around here.

40:42.982 --> 40:44.483
My name is Lucy Cole.

40:45.568 --> 40:46.986
And what do I call you two?

40:47.945 --> 40:50.156
I'm Jim Goode,
and this is my brother, Roy.

40:54.535 --> 40:55.995
I think he's a little astonished.

40:56.078 --> 40:57.413
As am I!

40:57.496 --> 41:00.833
From that impressive burst
of top-quality cussing,

41:00.916 --> 41:04.545
I thought for sure I'd be face to face
with a pair of deviant lowlifes.

41:05.254 --> 41:08.174
Do you mind telling me
what you two gentlemen are doing out here?

41:08.757 --> 41:10.342
We're on our way to California.

41:10.426 --> 41:11.427
Are you, now?

41:11.510 --> 41:13.637
Yes, ma'am.
We're gonna start a ranch out there.

41:14.180 --> 41:15.431
Where are you coming from?

41:15.973 --> 41:17.391
Moses, New Mexico.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.185
Oh, I know where Moses is.

41:19.685 --> 41:21.312
It's right next to Old Moses.

41:21.395 --> 41:22.646
Sweet little town.

41:23.189 --> 41:25.191
In fact, I live there.

Or, should I say, here.

41:29.028 --> 41:32.865
-I told you we was going in a circle.
-It was dark! How was I supposed to know?

41:32.948 --> 41:34.742
Forgive me for saying so, but...

41:35.743 --> 41:38.746
aren't you two traveling rather light
for such a long journey?

41:39.497 --> 41:41.081
W-We're just getting started.

41:41.874 --> 41:43.083
Yeah, I see.

41:43.751 --> 41:45.503
Are you on foot, ma'am?

41:45.586 --> 41:48.130
Please, call me Sister Lucy.

And though I do possess a wagon
and a beast to pull it,

41:52.218 --> 41:54.887
tonight, when we saw your fire,
we didn't see fit to hitch it,

41:54.970 --> 41:57.181

42:26.043 --> 42:28.963
these two fine gentlemen are Roy and Jim,

42:29.046 --> 42:30.923
and they're gonna be
joining us for supper.

42:31.507 --> 42:32.508
And maybe...

if we're nice enough,
they will stay for breakfast.

We ain't seen the boy around.

44:17.529 --> 44:21.158
But then, we ain't really had
no use for him, neither.

44:21.950 --> 44:23.911
Come here, pretty thing.

44:25.371 --> 44:27.373
[Logan] You're as light as a feather. Mm.

44:28.624 --> 44:29.750
Where are you going?

44:32.044 --> 44:33.379
I got chores at home.

44:33.754 --> 44:36.131
[Logan] Let a man help you
with some of them chores.

44:39.134 --> 44:41.387
You all seem to have made yourselves
right at home.

44:41.470 --> 44:43.097
That was the arrangement, wasn't it?

44:44.723 --> 44:45.933
[woman laughs]

44:56.026 --> 44:57.027
[Callie] Come on, then.

45:02.658 --> 45:04.618
[whistling and laughter]

45:06.036 --> 45:07.162
Where have you been?

45:08.288 --> 45:09.915
Busy looking after Bill's kids.

45:09.998 --> 45:11.041
[women laughing]

45:11.125 --> 45:13.711
You want me to come over tonight,
keep you company?

45:14.920 --> 45:18.549
Uh... I don't think Bill would feel
so good about us being in his place.

45:19.633 --> 45:21.093
Never stopped you before.

45:22.428 --> 45:23.554
I got to be going.

45:24.263 --> 45:25.556
Whitey's gone missing.

45:26.515 --> 45:27.766
What are you mad at?

45:27.850 --> 45:28.892
I'm not mad.

45:29.393 --> 45:30.519
What are you, then?

45:40.112 --> 45:41.280
Look, you want company?

45:42.531 --> 45:44.867
Go spend some time
with your little Fritz bitch.

45:46.410 --> 45:48.203
What is it you think you know?

45:48.287 --> 45:49.788
It's not what I think I know.

45:50.330 --> 45:51.457
It's what I seen.

45:52.082 --> 45:53.167
[girl] Miss Dunne?

45:54.668 --> 45:56.170
The students are in their seats.

45:56.712 --> 45:58.172
[Callie] Be right there, sweetie.

46:02.050 --> 46:04.386
-I guess I've been caught out, then.
-I'd say so.

46:06.597 --> 46:08.348
Although, I should have expected it...

46:09.516 --> 46:10.642
given what you are.

46:15.147 --> 46:16.607
Your pupils are waiting on you.

46:25.240 --> 46:27.409
I could sure use
a pretty hairbrush like that one.

46:28.285 --> 46:30.913
You know, it's been a long time
since somebody bought me a gift.

46:30.996 --> 46:33.874
-You deserve it.
-Any of you seen Whitey?

46:33.957 --> 46:35.375
[Asa] Who knows where he is?

46:35.459 --> 46:38.754
That boy just comes and goes
as he pleases.

46:38.837 --> 46:42.049
Asa? Or maybe one or two
of these sweet little clips.

46:42.132 --> 46:43.342
Good morning to you...

46:44.551 --> 46:45.594
ma'am. [chuckles]

46:47.346 --> 46:48.180
My goodness.

46:51.850 --> 46:52.935
Good morning, sir.

46:53.519 --> 46:54.520
[Sarah] Mr. Grigg.

46:55.020 --> 46:56.021
Hello.

46:58.106 --> 46:59.149
I would love...

46:59.691 --> 47:01.151
some of your finest tobacco.

47:02.486 --> 47:05.113
And some of that
delicious licorice right there. Oh.

47:05.864 --> 47:08.617
And one of those lovely-looking blankets.

47:09.576 --> 47:11.495
Hotel bedding is just a little bit thin.

47:11.578 --> 47:12.788
[Sarah chuckles]

47:15.791 --> 47:17.125
Say, could I ask you...

47:18.252 --> 47:20.045
how long have you lived here, sir?

47:20.879 --> 47:24.675
Since right after they brought up
the first ore, 12 years ago.

47:24.758 --> 47:25.884
My, my.

47:26.510 --> 47:28.387
I bet you could tell some stories.

47:28.887 --> 47:31.139
Oh, I could tell a few.

47:31.848 --> 47:35.394
Well, I would love to buy you
a glass of beer and have a chat.

47:36.478 --> 47:38.230
-I like beer.
-Good!

47:38.855 --> 47:41.775
I can't figure out
how someone with such delicate ears

47:41.858 --> 47:43.110
can tolerate such a racket.

47:43.193 --> 47:46.488
-[laughs] Delicate ears?
-I a'thought you'd want to protect 'em.

47:46.572 --> 47:47.781
[bell clanging]

47:48.699 --> 47:50.367
Owing to how musical they are.

47:50.450 --> 47:51.451
[scoffs] Oh.

47:52.578 --> 47:55.330
It ain't my ears that are musical,
it's my hands.

47:58.083 --> 47:59.793
They just do what they want to do.

48:02.546 --> 48:03.547
[sighs]

48:04.047 --> 48:05.215
You need a bath.

48:06.675 --> 48:08.343
-Yeah, I keep hearing that.
-Huh.

48:09.136 --> 48:11.346
Best you heed it,
you ever gonna seduce me.

48:12.264 --> 48:13.265
Excuse me?

48:13.974 --> 48:15.559
Oh, I know your type, Whitey.

48:16.059 --> 48:17.394
-My type?
-Mm.

48:18.228 --> 48:21.440
A boy like you is liable to get a girl
in the usual fix and then bolt.

48:23.942 --> 48:25.485
Yeah, well, that's me in a nutshell.

48:28.196 --> 48:30.198
[bell clanging]

48:36.163 --> 48:38.457
You still haven't told me
what that damn bell's for.

48:39.625 --> 48:41.668
Old Samson is blind.

48:43.378 --> 48:46.590
Sometimes he goes wandering off
in the nighttime.

48:47.799 --> 48:50.052
He don't wear that bell,
we can't ever find him.

48:51.053 --> 48:52.137
You got a blind mule?

48:52.638 --> 48:53.639
Uh-huh.

48:54.681 --> 48:57.893
They keep the mules down in the mine
for a whole year and never bring them up.

49:00.187 --> 49:01.855
They live there, down there in the dark.

49:03.899 --> 49:05.233
Then they bring them up,

49:05.317 --> 49:07.736
put a few layers of cloth over their eyes

49:07.819 --> 49:09.363
until they get used to the light.

49:11.657 --> 49:12.949
A lot of them went blind.

49:13.659 --> 49:15.577
Couldn't take the sun.
Samson's one of those.

49:16.953 --> 49:18.789
So my daddy got him real cheap.

49:20.207 --> 49:21.208
Say...

49:22.459 --> 49:24.086
you ain't so bad-looking, you know.

49:27.381 --> 49:28.382
Thank you.

49:30.217 --> 49:31.301
Well, neither are you.

49:32.302 --> 49:34.096
So bad-looking, I mean.

49:47.067 --> 49:48.068
How was that?

49:50.779 --> 49:52.572
It was pretty much like I imagined it.

49:54.074 --> 49:55.367
Maybe better.

49:57.035 --> 49:58.704
So you've been imagining it?

49:58.787 --> 49:59.788
[giggles]

50:05.210 --> 50:06.461
Take off your britches.

50:08.213 --> 50:09.339
Excuse me?

50:10.674 --> 50:11.967
I'm gonna give you a bath.

50:12.467 --> 50:14.636
-[scoffs] No, you ain't.
-Oh, yes, I am.

50:14.720 --> 50:16.346
[Louise laughs]

50:16.430 --> 50:18.432
[Louise shrieks]

50:21.768 --> 50:22.811
[Randall] Louise!

50:26.690 --> 50:28.150
Both of you, get on out of there.

50:30.444 --> 50:32.446
[bell clanging]

50:40.120 --> 50:41.997
Son, you best be on your way now.

50:42.080 --> 50:43.373
-Sir I...
-Daddy--

50:43.457 --> 50:45.667
You don't want to be speaking right now.

50:47.002 --> 50:49.337
And you want to be getting on your way.

50:56.511 --> 50:57.804
I see you back here...

50:58.472 --> 51:01.183
it ain't gonna be you
I lay a hand on, understand?

51:01.808 --> 51:02.684
Yes, sir.

51:17.449 --> 51:19.242
[Louise shrieking]

51:19.326 --> 51:20.952
[Randall yelling]

51:25.123 --> 51:27.125
[Randall] If I ever, ever...

51:27.209 --> 51:29.211
[shrieking and yelling]

51:35.175 --> 51:36.384
Oh, no, sir.

51:36.468 --> 51:38.094
[shrieking continues]

51:39.221 --> 51:40.347
No, sir.

51:40.430 --> 51:41.723
[rifle cocking]

51:41.807 --> 51:43.809
[shrieking and yelling]

51:46.812 --> 51:48.146
[Randall yells]

51:48.230 --> 51:49.981
[Louise shrieking]

51:56.863 --> 51:58.490
[horse whinnies]

51:58.573 --> 52:00.200
[yelling continues]

52:09.000 --> 52:10.585
Are you all right, son?

52:12.337 --> 52:13.547
Oh, just resting.

52:14.089 --> 52:15.215
[Randall grunting]

52:15.757 --> 52:17.300
[Louise sobs]

52:18.009 --> 52:19.344
We were just heading back in.

52:21.763 --> 52:22.848
Oh, me, too.

52:25.350 --> 52:27.018
Why don't you ride along with us?

53:11.438 --> 53:12.647
[wind whistling]

53:19.404 --> 53:20.614
[creaking]

54:31.184 --> 54:32.811
[horse whinnies]

54:48.034 --> 54:51.121
The woman shot a rimfire slug
into the eye of a buck.

54:51.997 --> 54:53.456
Probably 100 yards out.

54:54.374 --> 54:55.500
That's something.

54:57.043 --> 55:00.088
[speaks in Paiute]

55:02.132 --> 55:06.720
[speaks in Paiute]

55:08.513 --> 55:09.556
What did she say?

55:10.056 --> 55:12.183
She said she was aiming for the other eye.

55:23.778 --> 55:25.530
I should probably be getting back

55:25.613 --> 55:27.907
before that Logan fella
moves into my house.

55:27.991 --> 55:29.242
You hardly ate anything.

55:29.743 --> 55:31.870
Would you like
to take some home with you for later?

55:31.953 --> 55:33.288
Oh, no, that's all right, ma'am.

55:34.164 --> 55:35.206
Thank you, though.

55:37.167 --> 55:38.209
Good night, all.

55:50.764 --> 55:52.974
You saw what was really
going on out there.

55:53.808 --> 55:57.145
I would have surely made quite a mess
for myself if you hadn't come along.

55:57.228 --> 55:58.313
Oh, well...

55:59.397 --> 56:00.648
who's to say?

56:08.073 --> 56:10.867
A newspaperman from Taos
rode into town yesterday.

56:11.743 --> 56:12.869
A fella by the name of Grigg.

56:13.870 --> 56:15.663
Now, he had it in his head

56:15.747 --> 56:18.625
that Bill McNue had captured Roy Goode.

56:20.585 --> 56:22.295
What all gave him that idea?

56:23.588 --> 56:24.589
I don't know.

56:25.673 --> 56:28.301
But he brought with him a wanted poster
and passed it around.

56:29.719 --> 56:30.720
Did he?

56:34.015 --> 56:35.683
It was a funny likeness.

56:36.267 --> 56:38.686
Nobody in town
ever seen him before, though.

56:39.854 --> 56:40.897
Nobody?

56:41.397 --> 56:42.398
Well...

56:43.024 --> 56:44.692
nobody in that saloon, that is.

56:49.489 --> 56:51.324
And I ain't never seen him, neither.

56:52.742 --> 56:53.952
That man looked angry.

56:54.702 --> 56:55.829
He looked fierce.

56:56.788 --> 57:00.333
He's not at all the kind of man that would
stop a young fella from hurting hisself.

57:03.253 --> 57:05.171
Looked like he'd be the one
doing the hurting.

57:06.422 --> 57:07.841
[door opening]

57:09.509 --> 57:11.719
Thank you again, Miss Fletcher,
for that fine meal.

57:12.220 --> 57:13.346
You're most welcome.

57:14.139 --> 57:16.307
And, uh... And thank you, too...

57:17.809 --> 57:18.685
Mr. Ward.

57:32.323 --> 57:33.992
Sounds like you had quite a trip.

57:34.784 --> 57:36.035
Oh, it was.

57:42.208 --> 57:44.377
Anyway, I'd best get me some sleep now.

57:45.086 --> 57:46.754
That old woman wore me out.

57:51.885 --> 57:52.927
Good night, then.

57:54.721 --> 57:55.805
Good night.

58:25.293 --> 58:27.003
[Lucy]  I'm so proud of you, Roy.

58:28.755 --> 58:31.341
[Lucy] You've been a big help to me
these last few months.

58:32.091 --> 58:34.344
-I like it here.
-I'm glad to hear it.

58:35.595 --> 58:38.306
You know, you're welcome to stay with us
for as long as you like.

58:49.150 --> 58:49.984
Roy?

58:55.782 --> 58:56.783
Where are we going?

58:59.619 --> 59:00.703
California?

59:04.749 --> 59:07.377
-I'll get a blanket and come with you.
-You ain't going nowhere.

59:08.336 --> 59:10.755
You're gonna stay here in Moses
and wait for me to come back.

59:11.089 --> 59:12.257
Like hell I will!

59:12.757 --> 59:13.841
I'm coming with you.

59:13.925 --> 59:15.718
Roy, now, you listen to your brother.

59:16.344 --> 59:17.845
He means what's best for you.

59:19.180 --> 59:20.431
You can't leave me here!

59:21.182 --> 59:22.183
Go on, then.

59:25.812 --> 59:29.357
Now, you wait for me right here.
I'll be back as soon as I get work.

59:30.066 --> 59:31.109
Promise.

59:35.947 --> 59:37.824
You don't go nowhere, understand?

59:38.533 --> 59:40.827
You stay right here with Sister Lucy

59:40.910 --> 59:42.203
and wait for me to come back.

59:42.870 --> 59:43.913
OK, little brother?

59:44.914 --> 59:45.957
You go on, then.

1:01:09.040 --> 1:01:10.041
[grunts]

1:01:11.459 --> 1:01:12.877
[mutters] For crying out loud!

1:01:18.257 --> 1:01:20.259
[buzzing]

1:01:32.397 --> 1:01:33.731
Afternoon, mister.

1:01:34.482 --> 1:01:35.525
[McNue] Afternoon.

1:01:36.776 --> 1:01:38.736
You're as quiet as a clerk over there.

1:01:39.779 --> 1:01:41.447
Well, I didn't hear you, neither.

1:01:45.493 --> 1:01:48.538
Well, now, who can blame us
for picking the same beautiful spot?

1:01:55.044 --> 1:01:56.254
You catch a chill?

1:01:57.463 --> 1:01:58.548
[McNue] I beg your pardon?

1:01:59.382 --> 1:02:01.801
You got that coat bunched up
like it's Christmas.

1:02:03.094 --> 1:02:04.178
Yeah, well...

1:02:04.762 --> 1:02:06.514
it's because I'm hiding a big rifle.

1:02:07.223 --> 1:02:09.225
[chuckling]

1:02:13.563 --> 1:02:14.856
Where you headed?

1:02:17.942 --> 1:02:20.153
I was thinking about exploring Wyoming.

1:02:21.070 --> 1:02:23.364
Trying my luck
on one of them big spreads up there.

1:02:24.198 --> 1:02:25.199
Are you a hand?

1:02:25.658 --> 1:02:26.659
Foreman.

1:02:26.743 --> 1:02:28.244
[Bill Chick] Well, Mr. Foreman,

1:02:28.327 --> 1:02:30.788
I hope you're better at ranching
than you are exploring.

1:02:31.748 --> 1:02:33.082
Heading in the wrong direction.

1:02:36.377 --> 1:02:37.712
Am I?

1:02:37.795 --> 1:02:39.130
Wyoming's, uh...

1:02:40.798 --> 1:02:41.799
that way, isn't it?

1:02:43.843 --> 1:02:44.969
Is it?

1:02:46.262 --> 1:02:49.557
Well, that sure does explain a whole lot.

1:02:51.893 --> 1:02:52.727
Afternoon.

1:02:54.520 --> 1:02:55.521
Afternoon.

1:02:56.564 --> 1:02:58.357
Are you the gent that's been following us?

1:03:05.031 --> 1:03:07.325
Well, if that is so, it ain't on purpose.

1:03:08.868 --> 1:03:10.578
Do we know each other, sir?

1:03:13.581 --> 1:03:14.707
I don't think so.

1:03:15.625 --> 1:03:16.709
What's your name?

1:03:22.089 --> 1:03:23.090
Is something wrong?

1:03:24.634 --> 1:03:25.718
I'm just wondering.

1:03:27.428 --> 1:03:28.429
What about?

1:03:29.180 --> 1:03:31.808
What it was,
took the life out of your face.

1:03:35.394 --> 1:03:36.771
Was it just the weather...

1:03:37.647 --> 1:03:39.690
like most men who live out this way?

1:03:39.774 --> 1:03:41.150
Or was it maybe...

1:03:42.193 --> 1:03:43.402
things you've seen?

1:03:46.072 --> 1:03:47.782
Well, that's a...

1:03:52.161 --> 1:03:54.330
I think you're not what you say you are.

1:03:55.248 --> 1:03:57.542
I think you're harder
than you're letting on.

1:03:58.626 --> 1:04:00.878
Why would you hide yourself like that?

1:04:07.969 --> 1:04:10.847
Well, for starters,
I'm amongst 30 hard men.

1:04:11.222 --> 1:04:12.348
Is Floyd right?

1:04:13.307 --> 1:04:14.684
Are you following me?

1:04:22.942 --> 1:04:24.026
I am.

1:04:25.236 --> 1:04:26.320
You the law?

1:04:31.659 --> 1:04:34.453
While I admire your ginger, sir,

1:04:34.537 --> 1:04:36.455
sometimes men want me to kill them...

1:04:37.540 --> 1:04:40.209
so they can die attached to some purpose.

1:04:42.295 --> 1:04:43.546
Is that what you want?

1:04:44.505 --> 1:04:45.756
You want me to kill you?

1:04:47.466 --> 1:04:49.677
Turn you into a bedtime story?

1:04:51.095 --> 1:04:52.972
I'd prefer to kill you first.

1:04:53.306 --> 1:04:54.974
You won't kill me, friend.

1:04:55.766 --> 1:04:57.018
Not today, I won't.

1:04:57.101 --> 1:04:58.102
Not ever.

1:04:58.978 --> 1:05:00.146
I've seen how it happens.

1:05:00.229 --> 1:05:02.857
Ain't gonna be the law
that blows out my spark.

1:05:04.275 --> 1:05:05.359
If you say so.

1:05:06.569 --> 1:05:07.653
I know so.

1:05:09.780 --> 1:05:11.073
And now you do, too.

1:05:15.745 --> 1:05:16.954
[horse snorts]

1:05:33.012 --> 1:05:34.221
