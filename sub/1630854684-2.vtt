your daddy nothing.

08:37.751 --> 08:38.852
I won't. I promise.

08:38.852 --> 08:39.853
- Promise?
- Yeah.

08:39.853 --> 08:40.854
Okay.

08:45.859 --> 08:46.994
Y'know, I just got a phone call

08:46.994 --> 08:48.562
from the customer
you threw out your car.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.530
Yeah, the guy was being a jerk,
telling me how to drive,

08:50.530 --> 08:51.732
acting like
he was my damn boss.

08:51.732 --> 08:53.600
The customers are our bosses.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.102
And a bad reputation
can ruin us

08:55.102 --> 08:56.637
before we even get started.

08:56.637 --> 08:58.171
Yo, I'm done taking that shit.

08:58.171 --> 09:00.274
This is our company
that we started with my money.

09:00.274 --> 09:02.709
We can't turn a profit
and hire a third driver

09:02.709 --> 09:04.945
if you keep treating customers
like that.

09:04.945 --> 09:06.213
Hire a third driver?

09:06.213 --> 09:07.748
We bought four cars.

09:07.748 --> 09:09.149
Another driver lowers
our insurance,

09:09.149 --> 09:11.752
not to mention we're running
out of that settlement money.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.954
And when we're out of cash,
we're out.

09:13.954 --> 09:15.022
This ain't the streets.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.623
You can't just get
a new supply.

09:16.623 --> 09:18.091
Yeah, I-I know that.

09:18.091 --> 09:20.193
Then start acting
like a business owner.

09:20.193 --> 09:21.261
Wear your seatbelt,

09:21.261 --> 09:22.863
stop cussin'
and blasting your music,

09:22.863 --> 09:25.732
and for God's sakes, don't
throw out any more customers.

09:25.732 --> 09:29.169
And lastly, make sure
you get this homework done.

09:29.169 --> 09:31.638
Your Mama and I still
expect you to graduate.

09:42.182 --> 09:43.750
Those sheets are foul.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.853
She needed a fresh set,
like, yesterday.

09:50.958 --> 09:53.126
Take real good care
of your mama, don't you?

09:53.961 --> 09:55.796
Just like you did
when I was a kid, right?

09:55.796 --> 09:56.830
Mm.

09:57.597 --> 09:59.599
When you gonna give me
a grandbaby, Brian?

10:01.735 --> 10:03.203
Soon.

10:03.203 --> 10:05.138
<i>Who are those flowers from?</i>

10:07.040 --> 10:11.378
Um, a handsome fella
dropped 'em off.

10:11.611 --> 10:13.246
<i>He said he was your boss.</i>

10:13.246 --> 10:15.182
<i>My boss?</i>

10:15.182 --> 10:19.019
When--when's Kato coming
to visit?

10:27.260 --> 10:28.228
Meechie!

10:28.228 --> 10:29.896
Oh, Nikki, I missed you!

10:29.896 --> 10:32.065
- It's been too long!
- I missed you too!

10:32.065 --> 10:33.834
Mm!

10:33.834 --> 10:35.002
We'll chop it up in Cleveland, okay?

10:35.002 --> 10:36.403
- Okay.
- When we get back,

10:36.636 --> 10:38.638
I'm gonna buy out the Lincoln
for all the kids in the hood

10:38.638 --> 10:39.906
to go see <i>Coming to America.</i>

10:39.906 --> 10:40.974
- For real?
- Yeah.

10:40.974 --> 10:42.709
I wanted to see that
for so long.

10:42.709 --> 10:43.710
I know.

10:47.681 --> 10:49.883
Yo, yo, nigga, don't be hittin'
that shit from the neck.

10:49.883 --> 10:51.752
No one know
where your nasty-ass lips been.

10:51.752 --> 10:52.953
This my house, nigga.

10:55.222 --> 10:57.424
Hey, you won't show up
for a family dinner,

10:57.657 --> 10:59.960
but now you goin' to Cleveland
for Grandma's party?

10:59.960 --> 11:01.294
Now, nigga,
you know I'm her favorite.

11:01.294 --> 11:04.097
And I also know that
your ass is up to something.

11:04.097 --> 11:06.233
While I'm down there,
I'ma try and put lil' cuz on.

11:06.233 --> 11:08.201
James don't even got hair
on his nuts.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.370
Not to mention
you can't stand his ass.

11:10.370 --> 11:12.139
That's when he was growing up.

11:12.139 --> 11:14.674
Besides,
he been dying to get down

11:14.674 --> 11:16.676
since the last family reunion.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.112
You carrying product in the car
with Mama and Nikki?

11:19.112 --> 11:21.181
Man, fuck nah, nigga.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.816
Once I get James on lock,

11:22.816 --> 11:24.684
I'ma have B-Mickie
shoot it down.

11:24.684 --> 11:26.353
That shit sound risky as fuck
to me.

11:26.353 --> 11:28.321
Yeah, well, I ain't ask
your ass how it sound.

11:28.321 --> 11:31.391
And sometimes, you know, risks,
they worth the reward.

11:31.391 --> 11:33.193
Especially when
you franchisin' out,

11:33.193 --> 11:35.395
tryna put BMF all over.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.267
<i>Your Mama like the flowers?</i>

11:42.803 --> 11:44.771
So this is how it's gonna be?

11:44.771 --> 11:46.173
You rolling up on me
all the damn time?

11:46.173 --> 11:48.075
Damn skippy.

11:48.075 --> 11:50.977
Why you got your moms
at this shitty-ass facility?

11:50.977 --> 11:52.712
Bad insurance.

11:53.880 --> 11:55.715
I thought you was big-time.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.850
This here?

11:56.850 --> 11:58.852
This the best
your drug money can do?

11:58.852 --> 12:00.287
The neglect in this
motherfucker will kill her

12:00.287 --> 12:01.855
before the dementia does.

12:01.855 --> 12:03.256
Let me--look here.

12:03.256 --> 12:06.426
I can make some phone calls,
get her to a better facility.

12:06.426 --> 12:08.929
But my favors don't come
for free.

12:08.929 --> 12:11.098
Meech is out of town on some
family shit for a few days,

12:11.098 --> 12:14.334
so even if I was
going to help you, I can't.

12:15.202 --> 12:17.404
A loyal soldier.
I respect that.

12:17.404 --> 12:19.339
You know,
I was loyal to my ex-wife

12:19.339 --> 12:20.874
till she stabbed me
in the back.

12:20.874 --> 12:22.809
I don't give a fuck.
I ain't Sally Jessy Raphael.

12:22.809 --> 12:24.444
Why the fuck
you telling me all this shit?

12:26.980 --> 12:30.817
Sometimes a man
gotta look out for himself,

12:30.817 --> 12:31.852
stop protecting others,

12:31.852 --> 12:33.186
and do what's best
for him and his.

12:33.186 --> 12:35.021
I already told you
Meech is out of town.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.259
Seventy-two hours.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.862
Give me something on Meech, or...

12:41.862 --> 12:45.398
Mama ain't gonna know who
the fuck taking care of her.

12:54.808 --> 12:57.210
Yep, it's still dead.

12:57.210 --> 12:59.946
Dr. Greenthumb
is back in the building.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.481
Call me Tee, please.

13:01.481 --> 13:04.050
Okay, Tee.
Thank you for your referrals.

13:04.050 --> 13:06.219
I earned some nice commissions
off of that.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.220
You're welcome. I'm just tryin'

13:07.220 --> 13:08.555
to keep a smile on that face.

13:08.788 --> 13:09.556
Question.

13:09.789 --> 13:10.924
How much would my premium go up

13:10.924 --> 13:12.859
if I add a third driver?

13:12.859 --> 13:14.394
Let me find out.

13:16.263 --> 13:17.864
<i>Hey, question.</i>

13:17.864 --> 13:19.166
How much
would his premium go up

13:19.166 --> 13:20.534
if he added a third driver?

13:22.068 --> 13:24.404
So we recommend hiring someone
with a clean record

13:24.404 --> 13:27.040
who isn't considered high-risk.

13:27.040 --> 13:29.543
As in a teenager like yourself.

13:32.179 --> 13:34.214
Look, age ain't nothing
but a number, a'ight?

13:34.214 --> 13:36.016
Nah, but good looks.

13:36.016 --> 13:38.218
I've really been bustin' my ass
to make this car shit pop.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.520
You do realize
most businesses fail, right?

13:40.520 --> 13:42.355
- Yeah.
- And the ones that don't,

13:42.355 --> 13:43.857
they have something unique
about them

13:43.857 --> 13:44.991
that their competitors don't

13:44.991 --> 13:46.226
and they build their brand
around that.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.828
I think I got a good idea
on how to hustle.

13:48.828 --> 13:49.896
I'm just saying.

13:49.896 --> 13:51.865
The real money
is at the airport.

13:51.865 --> 13:53.533
The city and metro can charge
for longer fares,

13:53.533 --> 13:57.037
and first-class passengers,
they tip better.

13:57.037 --> 13:58.972
Hmm.

13:58.972 --> 14:01.208
First-class passengers deserve
first-class service,

14:01.208 --> 14:02.609
so I should probably
stock my car up

14:02.842 --> 14:04.110
with some good-ass snacks
and shit.

14:04.110 --> 14:06.012
You mean refreshments?

14:06.012 --> 14:08.481
Not "good-ass" anything?

14:08.481 --> 14:10.116
Look, how 'bout
we go to the grocery store

14:10.116 --> 14:12.118
and grab a few things
on your lunch break?

14:20.594 --> 14:22.095
Whoa!

14:22.095 --> 14:24.331
<i>That's my niece in that Benz!</i>

14:24.331 --> 14:25.632
How you doing?

14:25.865 --> 14:26.900
- Look.
- Oh.

14:26.900 --> 14:28.401
<i>Girl done come up!</i>

14:28.401 --> 14:29.936
Uncle Charles hit the lottery?

14:29.936 --> 14:31.338
Or Wendy's givin' raises.

14:31.338 --> 14:34.107
- Hey! How you doin'?
- <i>Girl done come up.</i>

14:34.107 --> 14:36.076
Oh, my good--
you know I'm trying.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.311
- How you doing, Lu?
- Oh, it's good to see you.

14:38.311 --> 14:39.646
- Good to see you.
- Oh, my goodness.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.114
Hey, Mama!

14:41.114 --> 14:44.050
You smell like a million bucks.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.119
- Damn, cuz!
- What's up, cuz?

14:46.119 --> 14:48.355
- You fresh to def, huh?
- You could be too.

14:48.355 --> 14:50.590
Not closing shifts
at the video spot.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.325
It don't pay shit,

14:52.325 --> 14:54.561
which is why
I still be on my side hustle.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.496
Check this out.

14:56.496 --> 14:59.366
Diversifying your yield
ain't always a bad thing.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.467
Nigga, I just made a killing

15:00.467 --> 15:02.435
off a food truck play
at the factories.

15:02.435 --> 15:04.571
The video stores you at
really might be better

15:04.571 --> 15:06.539
'cause you already
got access to it.

15:06.539 --> 15:09.175
You talkin' way over my head.

15:09.175 --> 15:10.910
Look...

15:10.910 --> 15:13.413
hook me up with ol' boy
that you been booming with.

15:13.413 --> 15:16.383
Then we'll spread the word
that your video store

15:16.383 --> 15:18.418
got a new release coming
later this week.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.189
<i>Where's Terry
and my son-in-law?</i>

15:23.189 --> 15:25.225
Well, they started
a car service,

15:25.225 --> 15:27.927
and it's only two drivers,
so duty calls.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.462
Oh.

15:29.462 --> 15:31.097
You working with 'em, too,
Meechie?

15:31.097 --> 15:33.266
Nah, Grandma.
I'm still with sales.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.501
Aw.

15:34.501 --> 15:37.137
Well, I am so thrilled
you here.

15:37.137 --> 15:38.638
Me too.

15:38.638 --> 15:40.573
Damn, I ain't know fruit
was this expensive.

15:40.573 --> 15:42.075
This is how
you step your game up.

15:43.576 --> 15:45.412
Look, so I already made
a list of some things

15:45.412 --> 15:46.680
that we probably gonna need.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.515
You dropped something.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.617
Oh, yeah.

15:50.617 --> 15:52.986
I was just cutting
printing costs.

15:52.986 --> 15:55.121
You gon' piss people off
doing business this way.

15:55.121 --> 15:56.623
Yeah, but I'm not really tryin'
to make friends.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.958
You gotta set the mood
for a pleasurable ride.

15:58.958 --> 16:00.527
I'm all about giving pleasures.

16:01.695 --> 16:03.663
- You see these Ferrero Rochers?
- Yeah.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.532
Those things melt
in your mouth.

16:05.532 --> 16:08.535
And you see these Andes mints?
They the bomb.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.671
Yeah, but how am I supposed
to spot first-class passengers?

16:11.671 --> 16:13.540
You gotta look
for men in suits,

16:13.540 --> 16:15.075
collared shirts and slacks,

16:15.075 --> 16:16.743
women with skirts and blouses.

16:16.976 --> 16:18.978
But you only got one shot.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.480
So when they ask you
how you doin',

16:20.480 --> 16:23.083
don't say, "What up, doe?"

16:23.083 --> 16:24.217
You say,

16:24.217 --> 16:25.585
"I'm well."

16:25.585 --> 16:27.187
That's proper English.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.191
Damn, everything you saying
is smart as hell.

16:31.191 --> 16:33.059
Thanks for coming
on a shopping date with me.

16:33.059 --> 16:35.428
It's not a date.
We're just shopping.

16:36.696 --> 16:38.031
Yeah.

16:50.043 --> 16:51.144
Yo.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.513
This my cousin
I was telling you about.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.515
- What up, doe?
- What's up?

16:55.515 --> 16:57.083
We got them trees for sale.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.218
Keep you floating for hours.

16:58.218 --> 16:59.486
Oh, yeah?

16:59.486 --> 17:02.522
I got some smoke that'll
elevate your game even more.

17:02.522 --> 17:05.191
Move that, earn a spot
in my organization.

17:08.661 --> 17:10.397
Your organization?

17:10.397 --> 17:12.332
Nigga, I ain't talking
'bout no kill.

17:12.332 --> 17:13.600
I'm talkin' 'bout
the baddest white girl

17:13.600 --> 17:15.235
you ever seen or tasted.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.337
Man, please.

17:17.337 --> 17:18.772
Bleek got the purest coke
in the city.

17:18.772 --> 17:20.206
Sitting at 60%.

17:20.206 --> 17:21.307
Oh, yeah?

17:21.307 --> 17:22.542
Well, this shit so ill

17:22.542 --> 17:24.477
you could step on it
three times

17:24.477 --> 17:25.812
and still be
sitting pretty enough

17:26.045 --> 17:27.514
that Bleek'll be your bitch.

17:27.514 --> 17:29.716
Instead of you being his.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.553
You ain't getting' pure
like that around here.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.655
Mm-mm. I'm from the D, homie.

17:35.655 --> 17:37.123
So since we just
feelin' each other out

17:37.123 --> 17:39.659
and just getting started,
I'ma float you some trees.

17:39.659 --> 17:42.061
You move that,
then I'll bring in the snow.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.096
Uh-huh.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.600
What you talkin'?

17:47.600 --> 17:49.235
I'm a businessman.

17:49.235 --> 17:51.571
So let's step into your office,
negotiate terms.

18:43.156 --> 18:44.524
<i>The reports are true.</i>

18:44.524 --> 18:45.892
Silas escaped this morning.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.461
Units are canvassing
the neighborhood,

18:48.461 --> 18:49.796
but there's no sight of Lamar.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.397
Any idea of where he might go?

18:51.397 --> 18:53.433
- Friends, family?
- Nah.

18:53.433 --> 18:54.567
But, you know,
this here's nice.

18:54.567 --> 18:55.702
I mean, except for

18:55.702 --> 18:57.504
the prostitutes
and graffiti outside.

18:57.504 --> 18:59.339
Hey. I pay, I pick.

18:59.339 --> 19:01.508
And if you put as much energy
into your sources

19:01.508 --> 19:02.675
as you do your lunch,

19:02.675 --> 19:04.410
we would have a lead
on Flenory by now.

19:04.410 --> 19:05.712
Well, in my experience,

19:05.712 --> 19:07.814
if a source don't want my foot
up they ass,

19:07.814 --> 19:09.516
he or she will deliver to me.

19:10.750 --> 19:11.818
<i>Nice.</i>

19:14.153 --> 19:15.221
This is a hot pot.

19:15.221 --> 19:16.856
You cook the uh, meat
and the veggies

19:16.856 --> 19:18.458
in the broth.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.160
Yo, there ain't no cats
or dogs in this, is there?

19:22.362 --> 19:23.863
Don't make me get out my gun.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.164
Look, I'm just sayin'.

19:25.164 --> 19:26.399
You know,
when I think about Chinese,

19:26.399 --> 19:28.434
I think about
almond boneless chicken,

19:28.434 --> 19:30.870
maybe some shrimp fried rice,
you know, some Mongolian beef.

19:30.870 --> 19:32.338
None of that is even authentic.

19:32.338 --> 19:33.907
If I'm gonna be taking you
to Chinese,

19:33.907 --> 19:35.642
it's gonna be the real deal.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.745
Okay. Uh...

19:44.684 --> 19:46.553
Meow!

19:52.659 --> 19:54.661
Taxi, right here.

19:54.661 --> 19:57.397
Let's go. Let's go.

19:57.397 --> 19:58.965
Keep it moving.

19:59.799 --> 20:00.800
You want to park at the curb,

20:00.800 --> 20:02.335
there's gonna be
an airport fee.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.903
Man, if you don't get the fuck
outta here with that.

20:03.903 --> 20:05.605
Everybody here's paid the fee.

20:05.605 --> 20:07.574
<i>You</i> get the fuck outta here.

20:08.575 --> 20:09.976
All right, damn.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.744
<i>Let's go.</i>

20:13.246 --> 20:15.248
No stopping.

20:17.584 --> 20:18.818
Let's go.

20:20.386 --> 20:22.388
Hey, my mans!
You need a ride?

20:24.324 --> 20:25.925
Yeah, but I'm going
to the West Side, though.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.660
And? Come on, hop in.

20:27.660 --> 20:28.995
I'ma pop the trunk. Hop in!

20:30.530 --> 20:32.665
<i>I got you. Hop in.</i>

20:32.665 --> 20:33.866
Thanks, man.

20:33.866 --> 20:36.536
No problem. All right.
Come on. Hop in.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.338
Keep it movin'!

20:38.338 --> 20:40.573
None of the other car companies
go deep into the city.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.941
Damn. Really?

20:43.409 --> 20:45.478
Hey, if anyone else needs
a ride to the North End,

20:45.478 --> 20:46.813
West Side, or downtown,

20:46.813 --> 20:48.948
<i>I got room for three,
I got room for three!</i>

20:48.948 --> 20:50.883
<i>Come on, hop in! Let's go!</i>

20:55.688 --> 20:56.756
How y'all doin',
how y'all doin'?

20:56.756 --> 20:57.824
<i>Let's go, man!</i>

20:57.824 --> 20:59.325

- Yeah, all right.

20:59.325 --> 21:00.727

22:19.605 --> 22:20.640
<i>Herb...</i>

22:20.640 --> 22:22.475
Pops, check it out.

22:22.475 --> 22:23.943
I hit the airport today,

22:23.943 --> 22:26.979
and I found a new market
we can definitely tap into.

22:26.979 --> 22:29.382
The other car companies
are too afraid to go deep east

22:29.382 --> 22:31.451
or to the West Side,
but we ain't.

22:31.451 --> 22:33.553
I even came up
with a business slogan.

22:33.553 --> 22:35.688
"We go where you go."

22:35.688 --> 22:36.889
You didn't get
out the drug game

22:36.889 --> 22:38.524
to be driving through
the worst parts of town.

22:38.524 --> 22:39.726
It take risk to expand.

22:39.726 --> 22:41.728
We could corner
a underserved market.

22:41.728 --> 22:43.129
And I even bought
some first-class snacks

22:43.362 --> 22:44.764
<i>to lock down
first-class passengers.</i>

22:44.764 --> 22:45.765
That sound like

22:45.765 --> 22:46.933
a waste of money to me.

22:46.933 --> 22:48.067
Yeah, but sometimes
you gotta spend money

22:48.067 --> 22:49.068
to make it back.

22:51.904 --> 22:54.407
And--and this'll set us apart
from our competitors.

22:54.407 --> 22:57.944
Listen, we need to stick
to who and what we know:

22:57.944 --> 22:59.946
driving folks
through the community.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.581
Look, Pops.

23:01.581 --> 23:03.116
We're partners.

23:03.116 --> 23:04.984
We gotta start hearing
each other out.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.886
<i>With the business model
I'm proposing,</i>

23:06.886 --> 23:08.755
<i>we could corner
the high end, low end markets</i>

23:08.755 --> 23:11.858
as well as hire a third driver
to start making some real bank.

23:11.858 --> 23:14.927
I just need you to trust me
on this.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.075
<i>Get on
the road tomorrow morning,</i>

23:29.075 --> 23:30.176
<i>and call me when
you reach the city limits.</i>

23:30.409 --> 23:31.177
<i>Open the door, motherfucker.</i>

23:31.410 --> 23:32.512
<i>It's me.</i>

23:32.512 --> 23:33.846
<i>What the fuck was that?</i>

23:33.846 --> 23:35.948
Nothing.
About to cut the radio down.

23:35.948 --> 23:37.850
<i>Just remember what I said.</i>

23:37.850 --> 23:39.652
<i>Hit me tomorrow
when you touch down.</i>

23:41.087 --> 23:42.188
All right. Bet.

23:45.625 --> 23:46.893
Dude,
the fuck is wrong with you?

23:46.893 --> 23:49.629
I'm on the phone talking
to the doctors about my moms.

23:49.629 --> 23:52.064
Right.
And my name is Bout Scout.

23:52.064 --> 23:53.432
I'm being real with you.

23:56.836 --> 23:59.472
All right, man. My- my bad.

23:59.472 --> 24:00.473
Cool.

24:01.674 --> 24:03.009
Now I'ma get the operator

24:03.009 --> 24:04.544
and have them trace back
the last call

24:04.544 --> 24:05.645
just to make sure...

24:05.645 --> 24:06.746
...it was the hospital.

24:06.746 --> 24:08.481
Wait, hold on, hold on.

24:13.753 --> 24:15.154
I'ma be real.

24:15.154 --> 24:17.857
Okay, that was Meech
on the phone.

24:17.857 --> 24:18.858
He's still up in Ohio.

24:18.858 --> 24:20.026
He needs me to secure a meetup

24:20.026 --> 24:22.595
between him and the Bubs
from 6 Mile.

24:22.595 --> 24:24.463
When?

24:24.463 --> 24:26.833
Two days.

24:26.833 --> 24:29.135
At the stash house
in Hamtramck.

24:29.135 --> 24:30.236
And you sure
Meech gon' be there?

24:30.469 --> 24:31.237
Yes, man. Fuck!

24:31.470 --> 24:32.238
That's the same reason why

24:32.471 --> 24:33.673
I couldn't answer
the damn door.

24:33.673 --> 24:34.740
Now you know
what's gonna happen

24:34.740 --> 24:37.009
if you lying, right?

24:37.009 --> 24:40.112
I don't got a reason
to lie to you.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.948
I just want this shit
to be done.

24:51.057 --> 24:52.091
- <i>Hey, look, my man.</i>
- <i>Hey!</i>

24:52.091 --> 24:52.959
<i>You in the black!</i>

24:52.959 --> 24:53.826
Just hear me out.

24:53.826 --> 24:55.561
We work too hard
to be paying a kickback

24:55.561 --> 24:56.863
to some guy
that's running a scam

24:56.863 --> 24:59.632
for pulling up at a curb
on public property.

24:59.632 --> 25:02.168
Know what I'm saying?
It's just--it's ridiculous.

25:02.168 --> 25:04.070
Hey, my mans.

25:04.070 --> 25:07.039
Who runs your business,
you or this guy right here?

25:07.039 --> 25:08.875
<i>Don't matter
as long as my check clears.</i>

25:08.875 --> 25:09.976
Yeah, but what he's doing

25:09.976 --> 25:11.611
is called
unethical business practices.

25:11.611 --> 25:12.879
Look, young blood.

25:12.879 --> 25:14.614
Don't come around here
stirring no trouble, okay?

25:14.614 --> 25:16.916
Most of these people been
driving for over ten years.

25:16.916 --> 25:18.885
And so what that
the white dude's taxing us?

25:18.885 --> 25:21.220
We still get to take care
of our families and make bank.

25:21.220 --> 25:22.588
Yeah, but look.

25:22.588 --> 25:25.157
If we stick together
and fight 'em as a unit,

25:25.157 --> 25:26.692
we could change the system.

25:28.127 --> 25:30.029
And what if we can't?

25:30.029 --> 25:31.831
Then you continue
business as usual,

25:31.831 --> 25:34.300
old boy keeps getting paid
for no fucking reason.

25:34.533 --> 25:35.935
But--but look, just...

25:35.935 --> 25:37.003
...just think
about what I'm saying

25:37.003 --> 25:38.905
and just get back to me, please.

25:38.905 --> 25:40.106
A'ight, bet.

25:40.973 --> 25:42.275
Thank you, brother.

25:42.275 --> 25:45.011
Hey, I told you.

25:45.011 --> 25:47.647
No fee, no curb.

25:47.647 --> 25:49.215
I ain't paying you
a goddamn thing.

25:49.215 --> 25:51.617
And you know what?
Matter of fact, none of us are.

25:51.617 --> 25:52.752
We blackballing yo' ass

25:52.752 --> 25:53.986
and filing a complaint
with the airport,

25:53.986 --> 25:55.721
so now you can get the fuck on.

25:55.721 --> 25:56.722
How 'bout that, huh?

25:56.722 --> 25:57.857
Bye-bye. Get the fuck on.

25:57.857 --> 25:58.858
<i>Your attention, please.</i>

25:58.858 --> 25:59.992
Yeah.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.262
Well done.

26:03.262 --> 26:05.131
You from the Flenory
Family Car Service?

26:05.131 --> 26:06.299
That's right.

26:08.301 --> 26:10.870
Don't you ever fuck
with our brochure again.

26:10.870 --> 26:14.106
Yo, get the fuck away from me,
you fucking weirdo.

26:14.106 --> 26:15.875
<i>You've been warned.</i>

26:17.076 --> 26:19.111
<i>Taxi Tommy,
keep it moving.</i>

26:19.111 --> 26:20.646
<i>Let's go, chop-chop.</i>

26:22.114 --> 26:24.850
Excuse me.
Where is the cab line?

26:24.850 --> 26:26.686
Oh, um, it's- it's down this way,

26:26.686 --> 26:28.087
but I- I can take you
where you need to go.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.355
<i>You know what?
Let me grab your bags.</i>

26:29.588 --> 26:30.723
<i>I-I'll take you.</i>

26:33.926 --> 26:35.161
- <i>Thank you.</i>
- <i>All right.</i>

26:35.161 --> 26:36.228
<i>You're welcome.</i>

26:40.833 --> 26:43.636
I only see these
during the holidays.

26:43.636 --> 26:46.305
Customer satisfaction
is our number one priority.

26:46.305 --> 26:47.807
I can tell.

26:47.807 --> 26:49.909
And I'll be sure
to recommend your company

26:49.909 --> 26:51.077
to all my colleagues.

26:51.077 --> 26:52.211
Thanks.

26:53.212 --> 26:54.747
Oh, damn.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.717
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

26:57.717 --> 27:00.953
Nope, I just don't want
any of my customers to be late.

27:00.953 --> 27:02.154
Excuse me, officer.

27:02.154 --> 27:03.856
I'm driving my clients
to and from the airport.

27:03.856 --> 27:04.991
I want to know if you guys
are gonna have

27:04.991 --> 27:06.292
checkpoints all over the city?

27:06.292 --> 27:08.361
Yeah, from downtown
to south West Side.

27:08.361 --> 27:11.097
<i>Be prepared for delays
or take alternative routes.</i>

27:11.097 --> 27:12.631
Okay. Thank you.

27:13.299 --> 27:14.266
Hey, do you mind
if I make a quick stop

27:14.266 --> 27:15.334
so I can call a client

27:15.334 --> 27:16.369
to give him
a earlier pickup time?

27:16.369 --> 27:19.138
Please, be my guest.

27:42.061 --> 27:44.997
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on.

27:46.165 --> 27:47.700
Man, is you coming
or you ain't?

27:47.700 --> 27:49.068
Yo, it- it's Tee.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.736
Nigga, hang up.
You cloggin' up the line.

29:30.436 --> 29:32.104
Wendy's is paying pennies.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.772

29:52.992 --> 29:57.796
Lucille,
I've always been proud of you.

29:57.796 --> 29:59.331
I was disappointed
when you married Charles

29:59.331 --> 30:01.200
and moved away,

30:01.200 --> 30:04.436
but you had to do
what felt right.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.339
You had already chosen
your path,

30:07.339 --> 30:09.008
just like Meech.

30:09.008 --> 30:10.042
Yeah...

30:11.944 --> 30:13.145
...but I just feel like

30:13.145 --> 30:16.048
I'm fighting one losing battle
after the next.

30:18.050 --> 30:20.486
You've always been stronger
than you realize.

30:22.021 --> 30:26.158
Now, every baby's gotta leave
the nest at some point.

30:26.158 --> 30:28.227
But if you raise 'em right,

30:28.227 --> 30:30.196
they'll always
come back to the tree

30:30.196 --> 30:32.431
and find their comfort
in its shade.

30:51.050 --> 30:53.118
Hey. How's it going?

30:53.118 --> 30:55.254
Mm, good. What's up with you?

30:55.254 --> 30:56.589

38:09.688 --> 38:11.323
She can expand
our customer base,

38:11.323 --> 38:13.392
which means our pockets.

38:13.392 --> 38:14.493
It's a win-win.

38:14.493 --> 38:16.795
Yeah, but how do we know
we can trust her?

38:16.795 --> 38:19.698
I worked with Denise for years
at the factory.

38:19.698 --> 38:22.501
She just got laid off.
She's a single mom with a son.

38:22.501 --> 38:24.803
Yeah, I mean, I got a son
I gotta provide for too.

38:24.803 --> 38:27.639

helps us do just that.

45:58.957 --> 46:01.059
But when something comes up,

46:01.059 --> 46:05.396
we have to do a better job
of communicating

46:05.396 --> 46:07.999
so things
can just run smoothly.

46:07.999 --> 46:10.768

Bro, we can't
do this shit no more.

46:15.874 --> 46:18.209
Yeah, you gotta communicate
that shit with us too.

46:18.209 --> 46:19.811
I mean,
Tee came through this bitch

46:19.811 --> 46:21.880

tryin' to call shots and shit.

46:21.880 --> 46:24.215
- What we supposed to do?
- Yeah, that was some bullshit.

46:24.215 --> 46:26.050
He messed our party up too.

46:26.050 --> 46:27.519
Who we supposed to answer to,
you or Tee?

46:27.519 --> 46:29.454
Yeah, Meech.
That shit be mad confusing.

46:29.454 --> 46:34.392

47:07.825 --> 47:09.561

47:12.830 --> 47:14.165
I was just trying to measure up

47:14.165 --> 47:17.035
to all those women
you've been fantasizing about.

47:17.035 --> 47:19.003
What the hell
you talkin' about?

47:19.003 --> 47:22.307
I was cleaning up
the other day, and I--

47:22.307 --> 47:25.543
and I saw those dirty magazines
in your guitar case.

47:26.945 --> 47:28.246
Well, I wouldn't have
to buy them damn things

47:28.246 --> 47:31.015
if you didn't treat having sex
with me like a chore.

47:31.015 --> 47:33.985
I wanna make myself vulnerable
for you,

47:33.985 --> 47:37.956
for you to take me
however you want me.

47:40.558 --> 47:43.061
<i>It's just--it's just so hard</i>

47:43.061 --> 47:47.565
to do everything for everybody
all the time.

47:47.565 --> 47:50.134
Well, lookit here.

47:50.134 --> 47:52.170
Saint Lucille
made some sacrifices,

47:52.170 --> 47:54.372
and now she wants praise
from the pope.

47:54.372 --> 47:56.374
Don't talk to me like that.

47:58.142 --> 48:00.511
That smut...

48:01.512 --> 48:04.048
This is you breaking our vows.

48:04.048 --> 48:07.485
No, this is you
breaking the law.

48:07.485 --> 48:09.153
And screwing up
Nicole's future.

48:09.153 --> 48:11.522
You just thinking about yo'self
and you embarrassed

48:11.522 --> 48:13.391
about what everybody else
thinks about you.

48:13.391 --> 48:15.360
Oh, no.
You talkin' about yourself now.

48:15.360 --> 48:16.527
Oh, oh, oh,
I'm talking about myself?

48:16.527 --> 48:17.629
Am I? Am I?

48:17.629 --> 48:18.663
Because it seems to me

48:18.896 --> 48:20.164
that we are just
two peas in a pod.

48:20.164 --> 48:21.532
We used to be.

48:21.532 --> 48:23.268
Do you remember?

48:23.268 --> 48:25.536
We used to be everything.

48:25.536 --> 48:29.307

when you used to like me.

48:29.307 --> 48:31.509
I am your husband, Lucille.

48:34.112 --> 48:36.381
And it would be nice
if every once in a while

48:36.381 --> 48:38.583
you wanted me like I want you.

48:44.355 --> 48:46.991
I'm just tired.

48:49.127 --> 48:51.496
That makes two of us.

48:59.170 --> 49:01.539
Here you go.
Enjoy the movie, little man.

49:08.713 --> 49:10.448

49:12.216 --> 49:14.185
You must've forgot that
we built this shit together.

49:14.185 --> 49:15.353
Tee, I don't give a fuck.

49:15.353 --> 49:16.954
Nigga, get in the game
or stay out of it.

49:16.954 --> 49:19.123
Can't keep tiptoeing in both
