- THIS PLACE
GIVES ME THE CREEPS.

12:25.536 --> 12:27.329
LET'S GET OUT OF HERE,
LIKE, NOW.

12:32.001 --> 12:32.918
COME ON.

12:42.428 --> 12:44.722
- WANT ONE?

12:44.805 --> 12:46.515
- NO, THANKS.
DON'T KNOW WHERE YOU'VE BEEN.

12:46.599 --> 12:47.600
- WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

12:47.683 --> 12:50.561
- I'M LOOKING AT HIM.

12:56.609 --> 12:58.402
- ALL RIGHT.

13:00.362 --> 13:02.364
LISTEN UP, PEOPLE.

13:02.448 --> 13:04.325
IT'S TIME FOR A SHAKEDOWN.

13:07.870 --> 13:09.997
THIS WEBSITE
IS STEPPING IT UP A GEAR.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.291
THERE'S A WHOLE WORLD
OF EYEBALLS OUT THERE,

13:12.374 --> 13:16.462
AND IT'S OUR JOB TO GRAB THEM
WITH OUR HOT, PUNCHY STORIES.

13:16.545 --> 13:19.256
AND AFTER SOME
REGRETTABLE LAPSES

13:19.340 --> 13:21.467
IN JOURNALISTIC STANDARDS,
WE NEED A NEW IDENTITY,

13:21.550 --> 13:22.760
STARTING WITH THE NAME.

13:22.843 --> 13:28.682
SO FROM NOW, WE CALL IT
<i>THE JACKAL.</i>

13:28.766 --> 13:31.060
- ISN'T THAT A BIT TABLOID-Y?

13:31.143 --> 13:35.147
- DON'T WORRY,
WE WON'T BE PRINTING ANY LIES

13:35.231 --> 13:37.816
OR CONSPIRACY THEORIES
ON THIS WEBSITE.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.151
NOT ANYMORE.

13:39.235 --> 13:42.071
WHICH REMINDS ME--
MARA, MR. SWEET TOLD ME

13:42.154 --> 13:43.531
THAT YOUR VERA RETRACTION

13:43.614 --> 13:45.199
WAS GOING TO BE YOUR
LAST POSTING ON THIS WEBSITE.

13:45.282 --> 13:46.742
AND, EDDIE,
I WANT YOU TO WRITE AN ARTICLE

13:46.825 --> 13:49.495
ON THE HISTORY OF THE SCHOOL.

13:49.578 --> 13:51.372
MY EXHIBITION BID AND FOOTAGE
IS AN INVALUABLE REFERENCE.

13:51.455 --> 13:53.624
CHECK IT OUT.

13:53.707 --> 13:55.334
OOH, YOU NEED TO SPOOL
THROUGH SEVERAL HOURS

13:55.417 --> 13:56.835
OF EXCELLENT RAW FOOTAGE.

13:56.919 --> 13:58.754
- YEAH, I DON'T SPOOL.

13:58.837 --> 14:01.090
- I HAD AN IDEA FOR AN ARTICLE.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.716
IT'S THE HUMAN INTEREST PIECE
ON--

14:02.800 --> 14:05.052
- OH, THANKS, MARA,
PUT THIS HUMAN ISN'T INTERESTED.

14:06.845 --> 14:08.180
BUT IF YOU WANT TO CONTRIBUTE,

14:08.264 --> 14:11.684
YOU CAN ALWAYS HELP EDDIE OUT
WITH HIS ARTICLE.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.019
- [scoffs]
YEAH, THAT'S...

14:17.273 --> 14:18.691
INSPIRED, CHIEF.

14:18.774 --> 14:19.900
I MEAN, WE'D MAKE A GREAT TEAM.

14:22.820 --> 14:27.992
- FINE, BUT YOU WATCH
ALL THE FOOTAGE.

14:28.075 --> 14:28.909
- FINE.

14:34.331 --> 14:36.292
- BAD NEWS, GUYS.

14:36.375 --> 14:39.044
THE CUP IS NOT A REFLECTOR.

14:39.128 --> 14:40.546
- AH, I THOUGHT THE BAD NEWS
WAS VERA.

14:40.629 --> 14:42.923
- I ALWAYS KNEW SHE WAS EVIL.

14:43.007 --> 14:43.841
- WHAT?

14:43.924 --> 14:45.009
YOU LOVED HER.

14:45.092 --> 14:47.761
- OKAY, MARA SAID IT,
AND SHE WAS RIGHT,

14:47.845 --> 14:49.513
AND THEY PUT HER ON TRIAL
FOR IT.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.141
WHEN DO WE GET EVEN?

14:52.224 --> 14:53.225
- AND SHE DEFINITELY SAID,

14:53.309 --> 14:54.476
"THE TEENAGERS
WILL DO THE REST"?

14:54.560 --> 14:55.686
- AND SHE DEFINITELY
CALLED US FOOLISH?

14:55.769 --> 14:57.896
- WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?

14:57.980 --> 15:00.149
- THAT WE'RE STUPID, OBVI.

15:00.232 --> 15:03.319
- NO, I MEAN, DOES SHE KNOW
ABOUT THE TUNNELS?

15:03.402 --> 15:06.155
- OR WORSE:
DOES SHE WANT WHAT WE WANT?

15:06.238 --> 15:07.656
- WHO WAS SHE TALKING TO?

15:07.740 --> 15:09.158
- HOW DOES SHE EVEN KNOW
ANY OF THIS?

15:09.241 --> 15:10.951
- WELL, WE'RE NOT EXACTLY
SUBTLE, GUYS.

15:11.035 --> 15:12.578
I SMASHED AN AMULET WITH A SHOE

15:12.661 --> 15:15.372
IN FRONT OF FIVE PEOPLE
AT A DINNER PARTY.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.374
- AND WHO MOVED THE DOLLHOUSE?

15:17.458 --> 15:18.542
VICTOR OR VERA?

15:18.626 --> 15:21.045
- WELL, LOOK,
WE JUST HAVE TO BE MORE CAREFUL.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.256
- SO IS THERE ANY GOOD NEWS?

15:24.340 --> 15:28.636
- YEAH, WE HAVE THE AMULET,
AND WE CAN TRY THE SECRET DOOR.

15:28.719 --> 15:30.471
WE'LL GO DOWN TONIGHT.

15:41.273 --> 15:43.108
- WELL?

15:43.192 --> 15:44.985
COULD HE REPAIR MY AMULET?

15:45.069 --> 15:46.236
- UM...

15:46.320 --> 15:47.529
SORT OF.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.739
- SORT OF?

15:58.165 --> 16:01.293
[sighs]

16:01.377 --> 16:03.545
SO--SO THIS IS OUR ONE?

16:03.629 --> 16:06.048
- I'M AFRAID NOT.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.132
THEY'RE BOTH FORGERIES.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.425
YOUR FIXER RECOGNIZED IT
AS HIS OWN.

16:08.509 --> 16:10.511
- WHAT?

16:10.594 --> 16:11.720
SO WHERE IS THE REAL AMULET?

16:11.804 --> 16:13.847
- STILL WITH
THE AMAZING ALFREDO?

16:15.391 --> 16:16.725
- [groans]

16:16.809 --> 16:19.728
OUTSMARTED BY ALFIE LEWIS.

16:19.812 --> 16:22.231
- WELL, YOU HAVE TO ADMIT,
IT WAS A CLEVER TRICK.

16:22.314 --> 16:25.901
HE MUST'VE SMASHED OUR FAKE
AND THEN A CRUDE FAKE OF HIS OWN

16:25.984 --> 16:27.861
TO MAKE US THINK
THAT THE TRICK HAD WORKED.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.405
- AND THE REAL ONE HE KEPT.

16:29.488 --> 16:31.031
SO IT STILL EXISTS!

16:31.115 --> 16:33.575
- IT SEEMS THAT ALFIE IS QUITE
THE CONFIDENCE TRICKSTER.

16:33.659 --> 16:34.952
- RIGHT.

16:35.035 --> 16:35.994
- OH, I GOT THIS FIXED.

16:36.078 --> 16:36.995
WHERE DO YOU WANT IT?

16:37.079 --> 16:38.414
- OH, PUT IT ANYWHERE.

16:38.497 --> 16:40.916
I'M GOING TO SEARCH
LEWIS' ROOM RIGHT NOW.

16:40.999 --> 16:44.920
HE IS GOING TO REGRET
MESSING WITH ME.

16:51.969 --> 16:53.262
- LOOK ON THE BRIGHT SIDE:

16:53.345 --> 16:56.598
AT LEAST VICTOR DIDN'T
MAKE YOU DUST DOWN HERE.

16:56.682 --> 16:58.559
- THIS BETTER WORK.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.442
- IT'S ANOTHER TUNNEL.

17:06.525 --> 17:10.069
- OH, GOOD, 'CAUSE WE HAVEN'T
GOT ENOUGH OF THOSE.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.196
- YEAH, MIX IT UP A BIT,
FROBISHER.

17:20.955 --> 17:22.374
- WELL?
HAVE YOU GOT THE DOLLHOUSE?

17:22.458 --> 17:24.376
- NO.

17:24.460 --> 17:25.961
- THE COLLECTOR
HAS JUST CALLED ME.

17:26.044 --> 17:27.003
WE'RE RUNNING OUT OF TIME.

17:27.087 --> 17:28.589
HE'S GROWING IMPATIENT.

17:28.672 --> 17:29.798
- HOW DO YOU KNOW IT'S A HE?

17:29.882 --> 17:31.008
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

17:31.091 --> 17:33.302
HIS VOICE IS--

17:33.385 --> 17:34.845
DISGUISED.

17:34.928 --> 17:37.514
SOME SORT OF DEVICE
IN THE PHONE MAYBE.

17:37.598 --> 17:39.725
- JASPER,
I JUST WENT TO VERA'S ROOM.

17:39.808 --> 17:41.852
- NO, NO, NO, VERA HAS GOT
NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.228
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

17:43.312 --> 17:44.188
THE HOUSEKEEPER?

17:44.271 --> 17:46.565
THE IDEA IS ABSURD.

17:49.902 --> 17:52.738
- SHOULD WE LEAVE STRING
OR BREAD CRUMBS OR SOMETHING?

17:56.575 --> 17:58.327
- SHH.

17:58.410 --> 18:00.078
[muffled voices]

18:00.162 --> 18:02.748
I THINK WE MIGHT
BE AT THE END OF IT.

18:02.831 --> 18:04.500
COME ON.

18:08.670 --> 18:12.216
- THE TRUTH IS, WE DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHO WE'RE DEALING WITH.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.384
SO UNTIL WE KNOW MORE,
WE SHUT UP AND PLAY THE GAME.

18:14.468 --> 18:18.013
PLEASE, JEROME,
YOU KNOW WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE.

18:18.096 --> 18:21.266
- WH--WHAT ARE--
WHAT ARE THEY--

18:21.350 --> 18:23.268
- OKAY, IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.162
- PLEASE, JUST LET ME GO!

18:47.960 --> 18:50.629
- EDDIE, WHAT WERE THESE DOING
BACK IN THE ROOM?

18:52.548 --> 18:55.050
- OF COURSE THE SECRET TUNNEL
LEADS TO THE LIBRARY.

18:55.134 --> 18:58.804
THE IBIS ON THE AMULET IS THE
EGYPTIAN GOD OF KNOWLEDGE, TOTH.

18:58.887 --> 19:00.556
- I LIKE TO CALL IT
A DEAD END.

19:00.639 --> 19:02.724
- YEAH, WAKE ME UP WHEN WE FIND
AN AMULET

19:02.808 --> 19:04.059
FOR THE GOD OF SHOPPING.

19:04.143 --> 19:06.895
- GUYS, AT LEAST IT'S GIVING US
A PLACE TO HIDE THE CUP.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.063
- WHAT NOW?

19:08.146 --> 19:09.231
- WE FOCUS BACK
ON FINDING THE OTHER REFLECTORS.

19:09.314 --> 19:11.692
WE SHOULD STAKE OUT
THE DOLLHOUSE.

19:11.775 --> 19:14.236
MAYBE SARAH WILL FINALLY HAVE
A CLUE FOR US.

19:14.319 --> 19:16.530
- THE GOD OF KNOWLEDGE.

19:16.613 --> 19:19.992
IT'S ONLY LED
TO MORE QUESTIONS.

19:20.075 --> 19:21.952
WHAT WAS JASPER DOING
TALKING TO JEROME?

19:22.035 --> 19:24.163
- I'M SURE HE'S NOT THE ENEMY.

19:24.246 --> 19:25.998
- WE DON'T KNOW THAT.

19:26.081 --> 19:26.957
HE LIED TO ME.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.083
- HE DIDN'T LIE TO YOU.

19:28.166 --> 19:29.626
HE JUST...

19:29.710 --> 19:31.128
HASN'T TOLD YOU.

19:31.211 --> 19:33.046
- ISN'T THAT THE SAME THING?

19:38.677 --> 19:40.554
- MARA!

19:40.637 --> 19:42.848
OH, COME HERE.

19:42.931 --> 19:44.141
I JUST WANTED TO SAY THANKS

19:44.224 --> 19:46.685
FOR BEING SUCH A GREAT
REPORTER PARTNER.

19:46.768 --> 19:49.313
- WE HAVEN'T STARTED YET.

19:49.396 --> 19:51.690
- YEAH, WELL,
I WANTED TO TELL YOU

19:51.773 --> 19:53.650
I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE
GREAT TOGETHER.

19:53.734 --> 19:56.278
- I'M STILL NOT GOING TO WATCH
ALL THE FOOTAGE, YOU KNOW.

19:56.361 --> 19:58.405
- YEAH, I KNOW,
WE COULD JUST, YOU KNOW--

19:58.488 --> 20:00.240
YOU AND ME, WORKING TOGETHER...

20:05.787 --> 20:07.789
- WHAT IS GOING ON?

20:07.873 --> 20:08.790
- THANK YOU.
WHAT IS GOING ON?

20:08.874 --> 20:09.791
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

20:09.875 --> 20:11.752
- WHY ARE YOU MAD AT ME?

20:11.835 --> 20:13.128
- BECAUSE YOU KISSED MY SISTER!

20:13.211 --> 20:15.380
- WH--HOW DID YOU KNOW?

20:15.464 --> 20:17.132
- TWIN TELEPATHY, BUDDY.

20:17.215 --> 20:18.133
- OKAY, I APOLOGIZE.

20:18.216 --> 20:19.092
I'M SORRY, OKAY?

20:19.176 --> 20:20.802
I THOUGHT SHE WAS YOU.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.471
I'M NOT INTO HER;
SHE'S NOT INTO ME.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.139
- THAT'S NOT WHY I'M MAD AT YOU.

20:24.222 --> 20:25.849
- YOU JUST SAID
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE MAD AT ME.

20:25.933 --> 20:27.100
- OH, READ BETWEEN THE LINES.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.143
- I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THE LINES ARE!

20:28.226 --> 20:29.478
THERE ARE NO LINES.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.480
- YOU DIDN'T TELL ME.

20:31.563 --> 20:33.273
- THAT'S IT?

20:35.651 --> 20:38.695
- I JUST WANT YOU
TO TELL ME STUFF.

20:38.779 --> 20:42.616
I THINK I SHOULD KNOW
IF YOU KISSED MY TWIN.

20:42.699 --> 20:45.285
OR, I DON'T KNOW, EDDIE,
THE FACT MR. SWEET'S YOUR DAD.

20:46.119 --> 20:48.956
YOU COULD'VE JUST TOLD ME.

20:49.039 --> 20:49.998
- YOU'RE RIGHT;
I KNOW THAT NOW.

20:50.082 --> 20:52.084
- SO YOU CAN TRUST ME, RIGHT?

20:52.167 --> 20:54.920
NOT TO DO ANYTHING STUPID?

20:55.003 --> 20:57.798
- YEAH.

20:57.881 --> 20:59.675
I'M SORRY.

20:59.758 --> 21:02.761
OKAY, FROM NOW ON, WE WON'T
KEEP STUFF TO OURSELVES.

21:02.844 --> 21:03.261
OKAY?

21:08.433 --> 21:10.519
EXCEPT THE WHOLE DAD STUFF,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

21:10.602 --> 21:11.353
- OF COURSE.

21:16.942 --> 21:19.945
[laughter]

21:22.990 --> 21:24.116
- OH, MAN.

21:24.199 --> 21:28.328
- WELL, IF IT ISN'T SWEETIE, JR.

21:29.538 --> 21:33.291
all: JUNIOR! JUNIOR!
JUNIOR! JUNIOR!

21:33.375 --> 21:35.419
[all chanting]
