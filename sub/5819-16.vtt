00:01.212 --> 00:02.678
Previously on The Originals...

00:02.708 --> 00:05.030
If this prophecy is fulfilled,

00:05.060 --> 00:06.309
you will all fall.

00:06.311 --> 00:09.362
One by friend, one by foe

00:09.364 --> 00:10.363
and one by family.

00:10.365 --> 00:11.698
The spell you used brought me back

00:11.700 --> 00:13.650
as I was when I died in this body.

00:13.652 --> 00:15.902
- When you were a vampire, you were... ‭
- A psychotic maniac.

00:15.904 --> 00:17.403
But you're worth being good for.

00:17.405 --> 00:18.988
I love you, Elijah.

00:18.990 --> 00:20.239
And Jackson knew that.

00:20.241 --> 00:21.574
Out of respect for him,

00:21.576 --> 00:22.902
I have to let you go.

00:24.712 --> 00:27.098
There was never any
hope for you, brother.

00:27.128 --> 00:28.431
Finn.

00:28.433 --> 00:31.133
Vampires are coming for
the last of the white oak.

00:31.135 --> 00:33.024
And now my sire link is undone.

00:33.054 --> 00:34.592
Those very foes will come for me.

00:34.622 --> 00:35.793
You're going to run.

00:35.823 --> 00:36.760
Don't stop driving

00:36.790 --> 00:37.973
till you're absolutely certain

00:38.003 --> 00:38.774
that you are safe.

00:38.804 --> 00:40.026
You don't have to remind me

00:40.028 --> 00:41.962
how precious my cargo is.

00:43.000 --> 00:49.074
Advertise your product or brand here

01:10.522 --> 01:14.155
You can bet the
competition's gonna be fierce.

01:16.864 --> 01:19.064
Not if I get to 'em first.

01:19.266 --> 01:20.649
I've waited long enough

01:20.651 --> 01:22.351
for my shot at Klaus Mikaelson.

01:22.353 --> 01:23.664
If anyone's taking him down,

01:23.694 --> 01:26.355
it's gonna be me.

01:39.465 --> 01:41.234
- Oh, my gosh! Okay!
- Oh, no!

01:41.538 --> 01:42.708
Sorry!

02:16.106 --> 02:17.555
Gentlemen.

02:18.558 --> 02:20.058
Come on, Elijah.

02:20.060 --> 02:22.360
I thought we agreed.

02:22.362 --> 02:25.563
The compelled waitress dumping
those drinks was a nice touch.

02:26.726 --> 02:27.720
But you're the one who wanted

02:27.750 --> 02:29.557
to keep the Strix around for security.

02:29.587 --> 02:31.837
As long as we have a legion
of Mikaelson enemies in town,

02:31.839 --> 02:33.839
how 'bout you just let 'em do their job?

02:33.841 --> 02:37.426
You know, Marcel, I was just
looking for a little me time.

02:37.631 --> 02:39.511
Well, as soon as they
know you're safe and sound,

02:39.513 --> 02:41.096
they'll be more than happy to give you

02:41.098 --> 02:42.953
all the "me time" you want.

02:42.983 --> 02:46.213
In the meantime, if you stayed put,

02:46.243 --> 02:47.964
maybe they could devote
more of their energy

02:47.994 --> 02:50.109
to finding out who's got their hands

02:50.139 --> 02:51.574
on that missing white oak bullet.

03:08.219 --> 03:10.063
Can I help you?

03:10.364 --> 03:12.795
I believe you already have.

03:15.933 --> 03:17.466
So, if you're looking
for an easy target,

03:17.468 --> 03:20.185
you're looking in the wrong place.

03:21.735 --> 03:23.472
Some free advice, Mr. Griffith?

03:25.125 --> 03:27.176
Know when you're outmatched.

03:47.081 --> 03:50.916
I was expecting more of a fight
from the regent of New Orleans.

04:00.352 --> 04:02.578
Who are you?

04:03.273 --> 04:04.963
I'm just a hired gun.

04:06.109 --> 04:09.213
Unfortunately, you're in my way.

04:15.530 --> 04:20.528
== sync & corrections by Wolfhound == 
== www.addic7ed.com ==

04:29.081 --> 04:30.611
Absolutely not.

04:30.841 --> 04:32.207
You need to blend in.

04:32.209 --> 04:35.442
We could start by
losing the $1,000 jacket.

04:35.472 --> 04:37.295
Tell me again why we're on a scenic tour

04:37.297 --> 04:38.630
of methamphetamine country,

04:38.632 --> 04:40.215
not compelling a jet

04:40.217 --> 04:42.256
to some far-off, preferably
tropical, destination?

04:42.286 --> 04:43.752
Look, I'm not the one with

04:43.754 --> 04:46.140
an army of pissed-off
vampires coming after me.

04:46.170 --> 04:47.956
Can I have the keys?

04:51.695 --> 04:52.929
On a scale of one to ten,

04:52.959 --> 04:55.034
exactly how much am I going to despise

04:55.064 --> 04:56.465
this little plan of yours?

04:58.014 --> 05:00.500
I'd say a solid 85.

05:01.523 --> 05:03.705
Oh, good.

05:05.200 --> 05:06.163
I don't care

05:06.193 --> 05:07.859
if he turned into a cloud of smoke.

05:07.861 --> 05:10.568
Your job is to be
Elijah's shadow. All right?

05:10.598 --> 05:12.419
Don't let him out of your sight again.

05:12.449 --> 05:14.700
I remember when you used to
bark orders at me like that.

05:15.644 --> 05:16.323
Ah!

05:16.353 --> 05:17.986
Those were the salad days, weren't they?

05:17.988 --> 05:20.438
Come on in, Josh. Have a drink.

05:20.590 --> 05:21.957
Take a load off.

05:21.987 --> 05:24.593
Tell me, how have I
wronged you this time?

05:24.595 --> 05:25.927
Well, you said

05:25.929 --> 05:27.596
that the Strix were as good as gone

05:27.598 --> 05:29.264
once we figured out who
was killing their guys.

05:29.266 --> 05:30.654
Turns out I still need 'em.

05:30.684 --> 05:32.768
Mm. And in the meantime,

05:32.820 --> 05:34.319
me and the rest of your benchwarmers

05:34.321 --> 05:36.126
are supposed to do... what?

05:36.401 --> 05:38.323
Besides keep the bench warm?

05:38.625 --> 05:39.624
Hilarious.

05:40.113 --> 05:41.832
But I've got a better idea.

05:41.862 --> 05:44.162
How's that saying go?
"If you can't beat 'em..."

05:45.699 --> 05:47.699
You want to join the Strix?

05:49.270 --> 05:50.587
Not gonna happen.

05:50.958 --> 05:52.835
But if it makes you feel any better,

05:52.865 --> 05:54.890
they're only staying to protect Elijah.

05:54.892 --> 05:58.393
So I guess they know
about the auction, then.

06:01.291 --> 06:03.903
For the last existing white oak bullet.

06:04.217 --> 06:06.854
Wait. You mean your army
of fancy-pants vampires

06:06.884 --> 06:08.284
didn't tell you about this?

06:08.314 --> 06:09.510
Weird.

06:10.319 --> 06:12.696
Though, that's the thing about
ancient vampires, isn't it?

06:12.726 --> 06:14.049
They don't pay attention
to modern things,

06:14.079 --> 06:16.878
unlike your friend here, who
minored in computer science

06:16.880 --> 06:19.431
and wrote a paper on the Dark Web.

06:20.245 --> 06:23.385
Bottom line it for me, Zuckerberg.

06:23.387 --> 06:26.021
I ran down some online rumors.

06:26.023 --> 06:28.640
Turns out someone claiming
to have the white oak

06:28.642 --> 06:30.775
is offering it up to the highest bidder.

06:30.805 --> 06:31.805
Today.

06:32.562 --> 06:33.694
Could be a fake.

06:33.696 --> 06:35.313
I wouldn't bet on it.

06:36.533 --> 06:38.533
I had the white oak bullet,

06:38.535 --> 06:41.235
palm of my hands, and then
some ancient vampire lady,

06:41.237 --> 06:43.070
she rang my bell to get it.

06:43.627 --> 06:45.190
Now, I think old vampire,

06:45.220 --> 06:46.858
I think you and your new friends,

06:46.860 --> 06:48.944
but it sounds like this
one ain't one of yours.

06:52.794 --> 06:54.366
Ah, Freya.

06:54.368 --> 06:56.702
Would you mind telling
your security team

06:56.704 --> 06:58.587
that I'm a dear and beloved
friend of the family?

06:58.589 --> 07:00.622
Well, that might be overstating it.

07:00.624 --> 07:03.608
For now, let's go with
"necessary acquaintance."

07:03.839 --> 07:05.677
Hmm. Flattery will get you everywhere.

07:05.679 --> 07:07.262
What do you want, Lucien?

07:07.264 --> 07:09.097
Question isn't what I want, it's whom.

07:09.099 --> 07:11.600
See, I've known the
Mikaelsons for 1,000 years,

07:11.602 --> 07:13.719
but you, Freya, are a new variable

07:13.721 --> 07:16.471
and I can't help but
find myself intrigued.

07:18.559 --> 07:21.810
Don't tell me you haven't
felt the spark between us.

07:21.812 --> 07:24.479
Uh... this really isn't a good time.

07:25.733 --> 07:27.315
Are you quite sure?

07:27.317 --> 07:29.317
I saw him with my own eyes.

07:29.319 --> 07:31.987
Finn must have come back
when Davina resurrected me.

07:31.989 --> 07:34.956
The spell was tied to the
blood of the Mikaelson line.

07:34.958 --> 07:37.659
Either it worked on him, or
he found a way to hijack it.

07:37.661 --> 07:41.213
Either way, the only "how"
I care about right now

07:41.215 --> 07:44.132
is how long I'm going to make
him suffer before I kill him.

07:44.134 --> 07:45.371
Restraint, brother, for now.

07:45.401 --> 07:48.170
Why? Finn is clearly
the one spreading rumors

07:48.172 --> 07:49.504
about missing white oak.

07:49.506 --> 07:52.174
He's luring Nik's enemies
out of the woodwork.

07:52.176 --> 07:54.726
It's all part of his
tedious revenge fantasy.

07:54.728 --> 07:57.095
You're wrong.

07:57.097 --> 07:59.676
Those rumors began before
either of you returned.

07:59.706 --> 08:00.602
Finn's innocent.

08:00.632 --> 08:01.632
Innocent?

08:02.986 --> 08:04.903
Pardon me, luv, but
Finn has tried to kill

08:04.905 --> 08:06.521
the rest of us more than once.

08:06.523 --> 08:07.989
He's an enemy of our family.

08:07.991 --> 08:09.524
He is our family.

08:09.526 --> 08:11.159
Finn's return is an opportunity

08:11.161 --> 08:13.445
to mend old wounds
and fix what's broken.

08:13.447 --> 08:15.697
He didn't just drop a bloody vase!

08:15.699 --> 08:16.698
He murdered me!

08:16.700 --> 08:18.183
You seem certain.

08:18.213 --> 08:19.785
Are you honestly siding with her?

08:21.538 --> 08:23.288
Time and again, Finn has demonstrated

08:23.290 --> 08:25.674
nothing but contempt towards
his family, so you tell me...

08:26.579 --> 08:27.846
How can you be so certain

08:27.876 --> 08:30.226
that he would return to us in peace?

08:30.998 --> 08:33.331
Our sister knows me well.

08:34.418 --> 08:38.003
Though perhaps you're right
to doubt my intentions.

08:38.321 --> 08:39.323
By all means,

08:39.354 --> 08:42.524
let's discuss our family quarrels.

08:43.328 --> 08:46.649
I believe we're long overdue.

08:58.769 --> 09:01.135
Well, I can see why
you wanted to come here.

09:01.165 --> 09:03.521
I feel safer already.

09:03.523 --> 09:05.439
We're closed.

09:05.441 --> 09:07.830
You don't look closed.

09:08.961 --> 09:10.478
We are for you.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.064
Well, perhaps you
failed to notice the hat.

09:13.066 --> 09:15.005
I'll take a bourbon.

09:15.035 --> 09:18.152
Unless Hollis is still
serving that moonshine of his.

09:20.175 --> 09:22.661
Well, I'll be damned.

09:24.410 --> 09:25.626
I got this.

09:25.628 --> 09:27.044
It's been a long time

09:27.046 --> 09:29.213
since you danced on my
bar, Hayley Marshall.

09:29.243 --> 09:31.564
It's been a long time
since I danced on any bar.

09:32.835 --> 09:34.448
I get in a different kind
of trouble these days.

09:34.478 --> 09:35.758
Hollis, meet Hope.

09:35.788 --> 09:36.843
Oh.

09:36.873 --> 09:38.373
Look at her.

09:39.516 --> 09:40.375
Ah.

09:41.277 --> 09:43.193
City boy, huh?

09:43.949 --> 09:46.063
Wouldn't have guessed that.

09:46.065 --> 09:47.481
Never underestimate

09:47.483 --> 09:50.256
the allure of indoor plumbing.

09:50.286 --> 09:51.869
Hollis, this is Klaus.

09:51.871 --> 09:55.043
He's my... daughter's father.

09:55.073 --> 09:57.157
It's a long story.

09:59.528 --> 10:00.691
We just...

10:00.721 --> 10:02.862
need a place to lay low.

10:05.796 --> 10:08.052
You picked a pretty rough
time for us around here.

10:08.054 --> 10:10.471
A lot of folks are giving
up on the pack altogether.

10:13.659 --> 10:15.198
Well...

10:15.228 --> 10:18.245
for the reigning dart-throwing,
tequila-shooting

10:18.247 --> 10:20.047
champ of Willoughby Lake?

10:20.049 --> 10:21.799
I just wish there were
a few more people here

10:21.801 --> 10:23.551
to give you a proper homecoming.

10:23.553 --> 10:25.093
- ‭
- Hey.

10:25.123 --> 10:28.160
You guys settle in,
I'll pour the moonshine.

10:28.190 --> 10:30.772
Baby drinks for free.

10:36.237 --> 10:37.520
Looks like we got

10:37.550 --> 10:40.006
a good news/bad news
situation on our hands.

10:40.036 --> 10:42.252
Marcel, I simply don't
have time for this.

10:42.254 --> 10:43.709
I got a bead on the bullet.

10:43.739 --> 10:45.789
Whoever found it is offering
it up to the highest bidder.

10:45.791 --> 10:48.442
Of which there are more than a few.

10:48.444 --> 10:49.827
This is your idea of good news?

10:49.829 --> 10:52.446
The bad news is word spread.

10:52.448 --> 10:53.886
The Strix are, uh, spooked.

10:53.916 --> 10:55.883
And they're usually
such a laid-back bunch.

10:55.885 --> 10:57.251
Well, with that bullet out there,

10:57.253 --> 10:58.636
half of them want to bury you alive.

10:58.938 --> 11:00.220
I can't blame them.

11:00.222 --> 11:01.188
You die,

11:01.190 --> 11:02.473
they die, too.

11:03.408 --> 11:05.859
Tell them that the Mikaelson
compound is quite secure,

11:05.861 --> 11:07.561
and with the addition
of their own forces,

11:07.563 --> 11:09.229
absolutely impenetrable.

11:09.231 --> 11:10.531
No one will leave
here, no one will enter.

11:10.533 --> 11:11.899
Do you understand?

11:11.901 --> 11:13.817
Maybe this will stop
their infernal bitching.

11:13.819 --> 11:16.737
Giving me enough time
to win that auction.

11:17.123 --> 11:18.622
Or kill the guy who does.

11:18.624 --> 11:20.074
Godspeed, Marcellus.

11:20.076 --> 11:22.042
Take a swing at me, huh?

11:22.044 --> 11:24.211
All these sidesteps and
parries... even the way

11:24.213 --> 11:26.046
you fight is boring.
It's an odd critique,

11:26.048 --> 11:27.748
considering all your flair and flourish

11:27.750 --> 11:30.084
couldn't keep you from
being bested the last time

11:30.086 --> 11:31.919
we faced each other.

11:34.457 --> 11:36.073
Perhaps we should let them fight.

11:36.075 --> 11:38.659
After all, they can't
actually kill each other.

11:38.661 --> 11:41.629
Behave yourselves.

11:41.631 --> 11:43.047
Particularly considering
we'll be confined

11:43.049 --> 11:45.165
here together for the
foreseeable future.

11:46.218 --> 11:48.052
What does that mean?

11:48.054 --> 11:50.921
I believe the term is "staycation"

11:50.923 --> 11:53.057
You see, Niklaus isn't the only one

11:53.059 --> 11:54.475
who's inspired revenge fantasies.

11:54.477 --> 11:57.761
Right now, we are all at risk.

11:57.763 --> 12:00.981
So... while Marcel works

12:00.983 --> 12:02.483
to retrieve the white oak, I recommend

12:02.485 --> 12:04.234
we dispense with all of this posturing.

12:05.354 --> 12:09.023
Get down to some good
old-fashioned family bonding.

12:10.493 --> 12:13.577
I'm quite sure this
glass hasn't been washed

12:13.579 --> 12:15.579
in the past decade, which makes it

12:15.581 --> 12:17.614
the cleanest thing
in this establishment.

12:17.616 --> 12:19.450
And you have hit

12:19.452 --> 12:21.535
your complaint quota
for the day, congrats.

12:21.537 --> 12:23.037
You are officially the worst.

12:23.039 --> 12:24.455
I seem to remember you knocking

12:24.457 --> 12:25.873
on my door to join
this little road trip.

12:25.875 --> 12:27.541
No one had a gun to your head.

12:27.543 --> 12:29.927
What was it... couldn't
bear to spend another day

12:29.929 --> 12:32.046
giving Elijah the mournful doe eyes?

12:33.349 --> 12:35.049
- That is none of your business.
- Right.

12:35.051 --> 12:36.850
It's only my brother and
the mother of my daughter

12:36.852 --> 12:40.888
in my house in... oh, yes... my city.

12:40.890 --> 12:43.223
Weird. It's almost
like you're making this

12:43.225 --> 12:44.108
all about you again.

12:44.110 --> 12:45.696
Hales?

12:46.729 --> 12:49.697
If you're trying to be discreet,

12:49.699 --> 12:54.201
start by turning down the
volume on the lovers' spat.

12:54.203 --> 12:56.370
Is everything okay?

12:56.372 --> 13:00.124
Someone tried to rob the
Gas'n'Save down by the highway.

13:00.724 --> 13:02.422
Kayla was there.

13:03.346 --> 13:05.546
I heard it went bad for the bad guy.

13:05.548 --> 13:07.439
Kayla McInnis.

13:07.949 --> 13:09.816
Her first.

13:10.318 --> 13:11.142
Wait, isn't she,

13:11.172 --> 13:12.502
like, nine years old?

13:12.504 --> 13:13.542
Fifteen.

13:13.572 --> 13:15.072
A girl I used to babysit for.

13:15.074 --> 13:16.788
The last time I saw her,

13:16.818 --> 13:18.659
she was playing with dolls.

13:18.661 --> 13:19.993
Now she's killed someone

13:19.995 --> 13:21.795
and triggered her curse.

13:22.294 --> 13:23.747
Where is she?

13:23.749 --> 13:25.582
The cops let her go home.

13:25.584 --> 13:28.585
Little trailer down by the creek.

13:30.172 --> 13:31.672
Where do you think you're going?

13:31.674 --> 13:34.091
Klaus, I remember when
I triggered my curse.

13:34.093 --> 13:36.260
Now Kayla is going
through the same thing.

13:36.262 --> 13:37.761
And that's your problem how?

13:37.763 --> 13:39.763
I used to take care of Kayla
when her mom was drinking.

13:39.765 --> 13:42.015
If ever she needed someone
to talk to, it's now.

13:42.017 --> 13:44.351
In case you've forgotten, we're
supposed to be keeping a low

13:44.353 --> 13:46.186
profile... it's hardly the
time to go play youth counselor

13:46.188 --> 13:47.604
to a bunch of misguided wolves.

13:47.606 --> 13:49.106
- It's just down the road. I hardly...
- In fact,

13:49.108 --> 13:51.608
I think this little experiment is over.

13:51.610 --> 13:54.778
I hope you enjoyed your
trip down memory lane.

13:54.780 --> 13:56.051
But my life,

13:56.081 --> 13:58.331
our daughter's life,

13:58.333 --> 14:01.306
takes precedence... a fact
you've clearly failed to grasp.

14:01.336 --> 14:04.371
From now on, we do things my way.

14:07.593 --> 14:09.259
Do we know this guy?

14:09.261 --> 14:10.677
Random enemy of Klaus.

14:10.679 --> 14:12.429
Elijah spotted him in the St. James.

14:13.630 --> 14:16.383
If he's here for the auction,
they must've sent him a login.

14:16.385 --> 14:17.517
Check his texts and e-mails.

14:17.519 --> 14:19.219
Uh, I got it.

14:19.221 --> 14:21.104
Yes.

14:25.643 --> 14:26.638
Welcome.

14:26.668 --> 14:27.527
That's her.

14:27.557 --> 14:29.112
You are the lucky few,

14:29.114 --> 14:31.365
chosen for your extensive resources

14:31.367 --> 14:33.900
and extreme prejudice
toward the Mikaelsons.

14:33.902 --> 14:37.633
Whomever's bid proves most
alluring to my employer

14:37.663 --> 14:39.828
will become the sole
owner of the last piece

14:39.858 --> 14:42.337
of white oak in existence.

14:42.367 --> 14:45.078
Opening bid is $5 million.

14:45.080 --> 14:47.131
Shall we begin?

14:51.336 --> 14:53.416
Whoa.

14:54.340 --> 14:56.122
A fleet of oil tankers?

14:56.124 --> 14:58.175
A dozen casinos in Monaco?

14:58.177 --> 15:00.710
Yeah, these guys are not playing around.

15:02.081 --> 15:03.830
Marcel?

15:03.832 --> 15:05.832
Type "Aliquid sub sole."

15:06.404 --> 15:07.751
It's Latin for "anything."

15:07.753 --> 15:09.720
An infamous Strix rite.

15:09.722 --> 15:13.006
It means the whole order pledges
to fulfill any one command.

15:15.394 --> 15:17.761
You really think that's gonna work?

15:24.111 --> 15:25.855
Hmm.

15:26.035 --> 15:27.584
Okay.

15:35.447 --> 15:37.114
Congratulations.

15:37.516 --> 15:40.266
4:00, 318 Toulouse Street,

15:40.268 --> 15:41.851
Suite 1.

15:42.008 --> 15:43.570
All right.

15:44.038 --> 15:45.984
Let's go get our prize.

15:51.822 --> 15:54.757
I think they reacted as
well as can be expected.

15:55.769 --> 15:57.850
Given your history.

16:01.046 --> 16:03.637
I know you've had your disagreements.

16:03.667 --> 16:05.333
"Disagreements"?

16:07.387 --> 16:10.138
Such a quaint way of describing it all.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.557
So you are listening.

16:13.446 --> 16:17.262
There can be no reconciliation
between me and my brothers.

16:18.432 --> 16:21.750
You told me that things
would be different.

16:21.752 --> 16:23.736
They already are.

16:23.738 --> 16:25.738
Your presence here has assured that.

16:25.740 --> 16:28.273
Look, when I said I wanted a change,

16:28.275 --> 16:30.826
I think you've misunderstood me.

16:30.828 --> 16:33.551
I'd still rather die than be
part of this wretched family.

16:34.518 --> 16:37.381
Freya, would you excuse
us just a moment, please?

16:37.411 --> 16:39.702
Believe my brother and I
have some catching up to do.

16:52.466 --> 16:53.516
So tell me,

16:55.435 --> 16:56.585
how was hell?

16:57.638 --> 16:59.139
Is it warm this time of year?

16:59.169 --> 17:01.305
You always had a penchant for idle chat.

17:01.307 --> 17:02.690
Well, perhaps we could discuss something

17:02.692 --> 17:04.742
a little bit more constructive.

17:04.902 --> 17:06.717
Do you intend to threaten me
into being a better brother?

17:06.747 --> 17:08.547
Depends. Why are you here?

17:08.983 --> 17:11.233
Could you believe me if
I told you I'd changed?

17:11.236 --> 17:12.984
- Have you?
- Yes.

17:14.012 --> 17:15.012
And no.

17:15.569 --> 17:18.458
All that time trapped
alone in Freya's pendant,

17:19.258 --> 17:20.159
I was able to reflect

17:20.161 --> 17:22.878
on what we've become over a millennium.

17:22.881 --> 17:26.176
I'm still sickened by what you are.

17:27.227 --> 17:29.927
But I'm done trying
to atone for past sins.

17:30.383 --> 17:31.537
It is curious

17:31.567 --> 17:32.672
the way you speak as though you and I

17:32.674 --> 17:34.757
- are not the same.
- We are not the same!

17:34.759 --> 17:36.642
You see, I still have a chance

17:36.644 --> 17:38.928
at some small happiness.

17:38.930 --> 17:40.897
And I'm gonna take it.

17:40.899 --> 17:42.499
My proposal is simple.

17:43.363 --> 17:46.102
Allow Freya to put me
back in a witch's body.

17:46.561 --> 17:48.521
Let the two of us go, and I promise

17:48.523 --> 17:50.656
never to look back again.

18:13.131 --> 18:15.537
Congratulations, Mr...?

18:15.567 --> 18:16.933
Aldus.

18:16.935 --> 18:18.151
Aldus Charlamaigne.

18:18.953 --> 18:20.702
And the pleasure

18:20.704 --> 18:22.070
is all mine.

18:37.489 --> 18:39.188
Joshua, isn't it?

18:40.992 --> 18:43.693
Tell Marcel Gerard he
cannot stop the inevitable.

18:44.431 --> 18:45.528
I answer to someone who wants

18:45.530 --> 18:47.280
the Mikaelsons to pay for their sins.

18:47.282 --> 18:49.982
And so they will pay.

18:53.905 --> 18:57.490
In the meantime, make it hurt.

19:02.580 --> 19:04.413
Always a good girl.

19:04.902 --> 19:05.987
Let's get out of here, shall we?

19:06.867 --> 19:07.872
Huh?

19:08.699 --> 19:10.603
There is a scared kid out
there, and I can't just

19:10.605 --> 19:12.605
- turn my back on her.
- And tragic as that may be,

19:12.607 --> 19:14.324
it's not my problem;
neither is it yours.

19:14.326 --> 19:15.608
Get in the car.

19:15.610 --> 19:17.026
We're leaving.

19:17.379 --> 19:19.129
We're not going anywhere.

19:19.220 --> 19:21.313
And I suppose you're going to stop me?

19:21.315 --> 19:22.754
Perhaps you'll get Cletus and your other

19:22.784 --> 19:24.283
foul-smelling friends to help?

19:24.285 --> 19:26.452
Those friends of mine
are helping us, Klaus.

19:26.454 --> 19:27.954
No questions asked.

19:27.956 --> 19:29.956
Despite the fact they
have problems of their own.

19:29.958 --> 19:32.308
And all you have done is insult them.

19:33.392 --> 19:35.594
You don't get it, do you?

19:35.596 --> 19:37.485
This is the exact reason why we're here.

19:37.515 --> 19:39.148
Maybe if you hadn't been a dick to...

19:39.150 --> 19:40.582
I don't know... everybody,

19:40.612 --> 19:42.423
then we wouldn't even be on the run.

19:42.453 --> 19:44.504
I have always done what I needed to do

19:44.506 --> 19:46.289
to protect our family
from numerous enemies.

19:46.291 --> 19:47.957
I make no apologies for my methods.

19:47.959 --> 19:51.544
Do you even hear yourself, Klaus?

19:54.352 --> 19:58.125
You're incapable of even pretending

19:58.155 --> 19:59.885
to be a good person.

19:59.887 --> 20:03.722
And you can justify it all you want with

20:03.724 --> 20:06.058
strategy and us versus them,
but at the end of the day,

20:06.060 --> 20:09.779
the enemies that you have
are the ones that you made.

20:11.192 --> 20:13.399
Is that what you want for your daughter?

20:14.264 --> 20:17.620
Is that how you want
her to see the world?

20:19.123 --> 20:21.373
I'm not just gonna stand back

20:21.375 --> 20:24.910
and let you raise her to
be just like you, Klaus.

20:26.194 --> 20:27.830
If it's your impulse

20:27.832 --> 20:31.133
to trust in the kindness
of those outside the family,

20:31.135 --> 20:33.835
all the more reason
you need my protection.

20:35.089 --> 20:38.424
I am gonna go speak to that
girl, because she needs my help.

20:38.426 --> 20:40.593
You're gonna stay here and shut up!

20:40.998 --> 20:42.261
I've earned at least that.

20:42.263 --> 20:43.155
Hayley, listen to me!

20:43.185 --> 20:44.847
There is a very good chance

20:44.849 --> 20:46.599
that one day our
daughter will be dealing

20:46.601 --> 20:48.767
with the same thing that
Kayla is dealing with.

20:50.562 --> 20:53.289
And if that day comes,
I hope that someone

20:53.319 --> 20:55.608
makes it their business
to help her, too.

21:04.785 --> 21:08.454
Being kind doesn't make you weak, Klaus.

21:15.763 --> 21:18.214
Elijah's just going to go for it.

21:18.216 --> 21:20.638
Uh, let Finn steal a
body and start a new life.

21:20.668 --> 21:23.241
You need to calm down.

21:24.795 --> 21:26.188
You know,

21:26.190 --> 21:28.658
I've never been in a guy's
actual bedroom before.

21:28.898 --> 21:30.609
Are you even listening to me?

21:30.611 --> 21:32.695
I am.

21:32.697 --> 21:34.664
But you raging about Finn
when you're stuck in here

21:34.666 --> 21:37.448
and can't do anything about
it isn't going to help.

21:37.478 --> 21:38.628
What you need

21:39.021 --> 21:41.287
is something to take your mind off it.

21:49.717 --> 21:51.130
It won't work.

21:53.035 --> 21:54.800
Is that a challenge?

21:55.537 --> 21:59.972
I just want Finn to suffer
for what he did to me.

22:02.179 --> 22:03.809
For what he did to us.

22:04.322 --> 22:05.978
He will.

22:07.166 --> 22:08.166
I promise.

22:37.360 --> 22:39.760
Don't you guys know bullies never win?

22:45.502 --> 22:48.020
Cutting it a little close on the
rescue there, aren't we, boys?

22:48.022 --> 22:50.940
Had to give you enough
time to do your thing. So...

22:52.086 --> 22:52.829
did you?

22:52.859 --> 22:54.076
Oh, yeah.

22:54.078 --> 22:56.412
She's gonna have one heck
of a dry cleaning bill.

23:01.702 --> 23:03.753
You're sure you can
track her using his blood?

23:14.215 --> 23:17.550
You'll be pleased to know things
are going just as you said.

23:23.441 --> 23:25.391
Sorry, road's closed.

23:25.393 --> 23:27.152
About to get a second line through here.

23:27.182 --> 23:28.172
Hold tight.

23:29.897 --> 23:31.530
You're certain?

23:33.610 --> 23:35.284
Then of course, consider it done.

23:39.355 --> 23:40.906
I don't think we've met yet.

23:41.230 --> 23:42.792
The name's Marcel Gerard.

23:47.715 --> 23:49.131
Free piece of advice.

23:51.192 --> 23:53.175
Know when you're outmatched.

23:54.305 --> 23:56.922
I don't get paid enough to die.

23:58.251 --> 24:00.643
The person who pays you got a name?

24:02.793 --> 24:04.430
All right, then.

24:05.733 --> 24:08.567
I have a feeling we can jog your memory.

24:08.569 --> 24:10.936
You don't understand.

24:11.393 --> 24:13.439
If I give you his name,
I'm as good as dead.

24:14.933 --> 24:17.610
And now that you've gotten in his way...

24:17.904 --> 24:19.495
so are you.

24:55.804 --> 24:57.134
All right, Finn.

24:57.136 --> 25:00.388
Let's see how you like a
taste of your own medicine.

25:12.350 --> 25:15.736
Whatever it is you're planning, don't.

25:17.574 --> 25:19.957
He cursed me to die, Elijah.

25:20.303 --> 25:21.742
Slowly.

25:21.744 --> 25:23.961
In front of her.

25:23.963 --> 25:26.080
If nothing else, I owe him for that.

25:26.955 --> 25:28.165
Perhaps.

25:30.299 --> 25:31.802
And perhaps the best revenge is simply

25:31.804 --> 25:35.037
to expel him from our lives altogether.

25:35.067 --> 25:36.067
No.

25:36.559 --> 25:37.847
He doesn't get to live
happily ever after.

25:37.877 --> 25:39.498
I haven't made my final decision.

25:39.528 --> 25:41.778
I only ask you stay your hand.

25:41.780 --> 25:44.303
That's not your decision to make!

25:44.333 --> 25:45.833
Control yourself.

25:49.305 --> 25:51.855
Unless you can't.

25:55.294 --> 25:58.295
It's worse than I remember.

25:58.747 --> 26:00.864
The rage.

26:01.066 --> 26:03.400
The hunger.

26:05.621 --> 26:07.871
I'd like to blame my anger on Finn,

26:09.975 --> 26:13.227
but it's been growing
worse since I came back.

26:16.499 --> 26:19.116
I never did learn how
to keep it in check.

26:21.403 --> 26:23.520
I never really cared to.

26:25.441 --> 26:28.275
But now you do.

26:28.895 --> 26:31.679
I couldn't live with
myself if I hurt Davina.

26:35.084 --> 26:39.253
But hurting the ones we love,
whether we mean to or not,

26:39.855 --> 26:42.472
that's just what we do.

26:43.575 --> 26:45.242
Isn't it?

26:50.450 --> 26:51.916
It is who we are.

27:13.323 --> 27:14.605
Hayley.

27:21.011 --> 27:23.147
I am so sorry, kiddo.

27:28.137 --> 27:29.987
I heard there's not much of a pack left,

27:29.989 --> 27:33.524
so I thought you might
need someone to talk to.

27:36.062 --> 27:37.661
But here's the thing
that you need to remember

27:37.663 --> 27:39.580
as you deal with all of this.

27:40.425 --> 27:43.005
You are a lot tougher
than you think you are.

27:43.464 --> 27:45.920
And no matter how awful you feel,

27:45.922 --> 27:47.788
you're not alone.

27:57.179 --> 27:58.382
Come on.

27:59.154 --> 28:00.434
There's someplace I want you to see.

28:12.939 --> 28:14.949
If you're searching for Kol,

28:14.951 --> 28:17.451
just follow the screams of the innocent.

28:18.111 --> 28:19.904
You'll find him close by.

28:20.507 --> 28:22.873
Actually, I was looking for you.

28:23.350 --> 28:24.658
Poor naive child.

28:25.486 --> 28:28.746
You don't know it yet, but
you're on the wrong side.

28:28.748 --> 28:32.030
Did my brother ever tell
you about the Novice Dulcina?

28:32.060 --> 28:33.200
You remind me of her.

28:33.202 --> 28:35.756
Innocent girl, beautiful voice.

28:35.786 --> 28:37.766
She promised herself to God,

28:37.796 --> 28:40.674
till Kol caught sight
and found her pretty.

28:40.676 --> 28:44.211
Within days, she'd broken
her vows of obedience

28:44.213 --> 28:45.705
and chastity.

28:45.735 --> 28:49.254
Within a week, she was dead.

28:49.284 --> 28:51.090
He'd grown bored.

28:51.120 --> 28:52.758
I don't believe you.

28:52.788 --> 28:54.871
I think you do.

28:55.473 --> 28:56.846
It doesn't matter.

28:56.876 --> 28:59.015
Kol's changed.

28:59.045 --> 29:01.495
But you're still the
monster you've always been.

29:07.779 --> 29:09.470
Hear you're looking to steal the body

29:09.472 --> 29:11.555
of some unsuspecting witch.

29:16.183 --> 29:18.228
What have you done to me?!

29:18.230 --> 29:19.736
Get comfy, Finn.

29:19.766 --> 29:22.918
I just locked you in that
body that you hate so much.

29:23.341 --> 29:24.273
You're stuck

29:24.303 --> 29:27.171
as a vampire for the rest
of your pathetic life.

30:01.758 --> 30:03.257
Kol, stop.

30:07.095 --> 30:08.762
Enough.

30:15.522 --> 30:16.927
This isn't your fight.

30:16.957 --> 30:20.291
I told you to stay your hand.

30:20.493 --> 30:22.160
Fine.

30:26.833 --> 30:29.439
I'd rather take my chances
out there with white oak

30:29.469 --> 30:31.636
than stay here with you lot.

30:38.878 --> 30:41.546
Elijah.

30:41.548 --> 30:42.964
He'll be fine.

30:43.766 --> 30:46.767
Marcel has paid us a visit.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.623
The last remaining
white oak in the world.

30:53.693 --> 30:55.860
Right here.

30:57.513 --> 30:59.680
Sister, if you would be so kind.

31:03.537 --> 31:04.736
No!

31:06.172 --> 31:07.172
Brother!

31:11.010 --> 31:13.060
Little witch has condemned me.

31:14.197 --> 31:15.864
To this.

31:17.817 --> 31:20.017
To remain a beast.

31:20.819 --> 31:22.892
Elijah...

31:22.922 --> 31:27.091
I can't bear an eternity
with no hope of escape.

31:27.393 --> 31:29.559
Can you?

32:00.593 --> 32:02.093
What is this place?

32:03.999 --> 32:05.419
The pack used to come here

32:05.449 --> 32:08.500
when someone triggered their curse.

32:08.951 --> 32:11.369
Not to ask for forgiveness, but...

32:12.436 --> 32:14.339
to accept what they had done.

32:16.347 --> 32:18.747
To honor the dead in order to move on.

32:26.780 --> 32:28.803
I don't even know his name.

32:34.027 --> 32:35.226
Here.

32:35.228 --> 32:37.562
This was his.

32:38.824 --> 32:41.732
I have an old friend at
the sheriff's department.

32:41.734 --> 32:44.391
He used to get me out of
trouble back in the day.

32:44.421 --> 32:46.371
I called in a favor.

32:48.258 --> 32:50.964
Look, the turning is gonna hurt,

32:50.994 --> 32:54.429
and your first full moon
is gonna be a real bitch.

32:55.802 --> 32:59.434
But like I said, you're
tough; you can handle it.

33:02.035 --> 33:05.126
You'll never forget
what happened, but...

33:07.000 --> 33:09.727
you can't let the past
define who you are.

33:46.012 --> 33:48.349
Finn, give it to me.

33:53.183 --> 33:54.605
Give it to me.

34:17.797 --> 34:20.181
Come on, then.

34:20.782 --> 34:22.300
After all this time,

34:22.302 --> 34:24.302
go on and destroy it.

34:26.786 --> 34:32.226
Elijah, forever is a burden
that nobody should have to bear.

34:33.947 --> 34:37.147
You cannot keep that white
oak in this house, Elijah.

34:38.128 --> 34:41.369
It is already a beacon
drawing your enemies to you.

34:49.503 --> 34:51.853
Perhaps the best solution is obvious.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.917
Entrust it to the one who
loves each of you most.

35:01.739 --> 35:03.189
I can cloak myself.

35:06.460 --> 35:09.536
If it has to exist, at
least I can take it far away.

35:10.148 --> 35:12.221
Hide it under a thousand spells,

35:12.251 --> 35:15.452
somewhere where no one
else will ever find it.

35:17.289 --> 35:21.675
Until the day comes when...

35:22.507 --> 35:25.129
you're ready for release.

35:49.909 --> 35:52.061
Man, I really thought asking nicely

35:52.091 --> 35:54.058
would totally do the trick.

35:54.060 --> 35:56.310
Now, your boss is jonesing real
bad for some Mikaelson blood,

35:56.312 --> 35:58.429
and I just want to know who he is.

36:01.651 --> 36:04.101
Ain't no need for this to get nasty.

36:04.103 --> 36:05.353
You poor fools.

36:07.323 --> 36:09.440
I let you take that bullet.

36:10.943 --> 36:12.777
He wanted you to have it.

36:13.828 --> 36:15.329
Who?

36:36.219 --> 36:37.968
Vincent!

36:52.747 --> 36:54.819
I understand.

37:10.720 --> 37:12.420
The ancestors...

37:14.557 --> 37:16.557
they don't want me to kill you.

37:19.979 --> 37:22.229
They want me to help you.

37:22.231 --> 37:25.182
They want me to help him.

37:26.147 --> 37:28.436
And may God have mercy on us all.

37:41.079 --> 37:42.985
Where's Hope?

37:43.015 --> 37:44.848
With Hollis.

37:45.274 --> 37:47.089
You trust him,

37:47.119 --> 37:48.219
I trust you.

37:49.923 --> 37:51.889
Baby steps,

37:52.311 --> 37:53.361
as it were.

37:57.439 --> 37:59.784
Seems I owe you an apology,

37:59.786 --> 38:01.752
little wolf.

38:01.754 --> 38:04.789
I've given you a thousand
reasons to abandon me,

38:05.699 --> 38:08.459
but you haven't yet.

38:10.296 --> 38:13.130
So... thank you,

38:13.779 --> 38:15.135
for my sake

38:15.165 --> 38:16.815
and for our daughter's.

38:21.510 --> 38:23.060
Perhaps you're right.

38:25.382 --> 38:27.812
Perhaps...

38:27.814 --> 38:29.480
it is time

38:29.482 --> 38:32.533
to start living not by my decisions,

38:32.535 --> 38:37.872
not by yours, but by
what we together decide.

38:40.149 --> 38:41.659
Partners.

38:44.166 --> 38:45.166
For Hope.

38:51.755 --> 38:53.170
What's wrong?

38:55.506 --> 38:57.508
This was no random attack.

38:58.224 --> 39:00.624
These wolves aren't just disappearing.

39:04.817 --> 39:06.934
They're being hunted.

39:10.773 --> 39:13.324
You think I should've
burned it, don't you?

39:13.326 --> 39:16.477
It's your call, not mine.

39:18.197 --> 39:20.398
I sure as hell don't envy you though.

39:20.400 --> 39:22.616
I think the phrase "sibling rivalry"

39:22.618 --> 39:24.691
is about to take on a whole new meaning.

39:24.721 --> 39:26.604
I can handle my brothers.

39:27.733 --> 39:28.711
Mm.

39:28.741 --> 39:30.858
The rest is gravy, right?

39:33.138 --> 39:35.696
We'll get a name out of our
new lady friend soon enough.

39:35.698 --> 39:38.199
And without a weapon, all the
rest of the revenge seekers

39:38.201 --> 39:40.401
are just a bunch of buzzing flies.

39:40.553 --> 39:41.553
Maybe.

39:44.509 --> 39:47.842
Did it not seem... too easy?

39:50.902 --> 39:52.047
Hey.

39:52.839 --> 39:54.589
Maybe I'm just that good.

40:07.731 --> 40:09.281
We got the white oak.

40:09.935 --> 40:10.904
Time to come home.

40:10.934 --> 40:13.851
Well, at least one of us
has something good to report.

40:14.317 --> 40:15.903
Because Hayley and I have just made

40:15.905 --> 40:17.905
a rather unsettling discovery.

40:18.391 --> 40:21.442
Seems our friends at
Kingmaker Land Development

40:21.444 --> 40:23.110
are still targeting wolves.

40:23.559 --> 40:25.947
What we don't know is why.

40:41.465 --> 40:42.680
This whole time,

40:42.682 --> 40:46.634
we've been so consumed
with everything out there.

40:47.198 --> 40:50.605
This auction, this
swarm of old enemies...

40:50.607 --> 40:53.070
What if it was all a distraction?

40:53.100 --> 40:55.514
Niklaus, I'm beginning to
fear that the real threat

40:55.544 --> 40:57.544
has been in front of us all along.

40:58.547 --> 40:59.547
Vincent.

41:03.215 --> 41:04.515
Something wrong?

41:05.037 --> 41:06.037
Very much.

41:33.833 --> 41:34.883
Hello, luv.

41:44.427 --> 41:48.012
A Mikaelson witch, a white oak bullet.

41:48.014 --> 41:51.382
Throw in a dash of wolf
venom and a case of champagne,

41:51.384 --> 41:55.135
and I'd say we have a
recipe for some real fun.
