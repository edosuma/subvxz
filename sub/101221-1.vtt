00:00.601 --> 00:02.603
(upbeat music)

01:24.518 --> 01:27.288
(hooves clomping)

01:40.934 --> 01:41.802
- God help me.

01:45.139 --> 01:45.939
- Dalton!

01:47.941 --> 01:50.077
You're makin' me mad, boy!

01:53.781 --> 01:58.752
(gentle music)
(tree branches rustling)

02:07.928 --> 02:08.929
I know you're out.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.465
You caught me on a good day.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.601
Get on outta here.

02:13.634 --> 02:18.639
(gentle music)
(tree branches rustling)

02:30.150 --> 02:30.984
I said go!

02:35.289 --> 02:36.490
(shot firing)

02:36.490 --> 02:39.193
(dramatic music)

02:45.599 --> 02:47.701
You shoulda never run, boy.

02:47.701 --> 02:50.338
(pensive music)

02:53.006 --> 02:57.978
(shot firing)
(pensive music)

03:08.889 --> 03:13.894
(hooves clomping)
(pensive music)

03:19.367 --> 03:22.403
(patrons chattering)

03:25.806 --> 03:27.241
- Bullshit.

03:27.241 --> 03:28.742
- Bob.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.844
- This is bullshit, Emmett.

03:30.878 --> 03:32.680
- What's wrong with
Bob and Emmett?

03:32.680 --> 03:34.748
- Their brother Frank
were found dead.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.984
- You mean Frank the deputy?

03:37.017 --> 03:39.086
- Aye, been missin' for a week.

03:40.087 --> 03:41.755
- Well, what happened?

03:41.822 --> 03:43.824
- His body was all shot up.

03:43.824 --> 03:46.560
Half his bleedin'
face was blown off.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.830
Bob and Emmett had to
identify the remains.

03:49.863 --> 03:50.698
- Well, hell.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.900
You can't blame 'em.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.569
Can you imagine if
it was your brother?

03:56.570 --> 03:58.906
- Sure I can but I just don't

03:58.906 --> 04:01.208
want Bob startin'
any trouble in here.

04:03.176 --> 04:05.012
- Did they know who did it?

04:05.045 --> 04:06.580
- They have someone in mind.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.417
(Terri sighs)

04:09.450 --> 04:12.620
- We need to be calm
and think this through.

04:13.554 --> 04:14.722
- I am calm!

04:15.889 --> 04:18.359
When I found out who did
it I'm gonna kill 'em.

04:20.761 --> 04:22.463
- You can't do that.

04:22.530 --> 04:23.964
- And why not?

04:23.964 --> 04:25.299
Did you see his body?

04:26.634 --> 04:29.470
- That'd be revenge, murder.

04:29.470 --> 04:31.539
They'll put you away for it.

04:31.572 --> 04:32.740
- I don't care!

04:32.773 --> 04:33.907
Don't you want these
bastards to pay

04:33.907 --> 04:35.242
for what they did to Frank?

04:36.877 --> 04:38.045
- Of course I do.

04:38.045 --> 04:41.114
Got to let the
lawmen do their job.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.282
- What a joke!

04:42.316 --> 04:44.318
There ain't no law in Kansas.

04:44.385 --> 04:46.219
That's what's the problem.

04:46.253 --> 04:49.323
(patrons chattering)

04:56.063 --> 04:57.097
- Well, what?

04:58.999 --> 05:00.000
- Join me.

05:00.000 --> 05:00.801
- [Emmett] Huh?

05:02.970 --> 05:03.971
- Join me.

05:08.075 --> 05:09.242
I'm gon' get me a badge

05:09.276 --> 05:11.445
and I'm gon' get these
son of a bitches.

05:14.515 --> 05:15.783
I want you to join me.

05:19.086 --> 05:19.920
- I'll do it.

05:21.689 --> 05:23.357
- You will?

05:23.357 --> 05:24.358
- For Frank.

05:24.358 --> 05:27.428
(patrons chattering)

05:28.962 --> 05:30.097
I have to do this.

05:32.500 --> 05:34.835
- I'll get Grat to join us.

05:34.835 --> 05:35.836
I'll talk to him.

05:38.305 --> 05:39.139
- Okay.

05:42.376 --> 05:43.544
- Get you another drink?

05:45.278 --> 05:49.450
- No, but there's something
else you can get for me woman.

05:49.483 --> 05:50.951
Hey, come back here.

05:52.119 --> 05:54.888
- You get your mitts
of me girl, Slade.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.957
- Damn it, Bridget,
she's a whore.

05:56.990 --> 05:58.459
Let her be a whore.

05:58.459 --> 06:01.995
- She's a good workin' girl
who deserves to be paid.

06:02.029 --> 06:05.466
You still owe for your
last two visits here.

06:05.466 --> 06:08.736
You square up and then
she'll be nice to ya.

06:08.736 --> 06:09.537
- Fine.

06:09.537 --> 06:11.338
I'll be back on payday.

06:12.372 --> 06:13.541
- I know you will.

06:18.546 --> 06:21.214
(pensive music)

06:34.261 --> 06:36.430
- That was a nice funeral.

06:36.497 --> 06:39.500
- I appreciate all the
folks who showed up.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.834
- He had a lotta friends.

06:42.235 --> 06:45.606
- Skeeter, do you understand
what happened to Uncle Frank?

06:45.673 --> 06:48.842
- He ain't gonna be
comin' around no more.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.043
- That's right.

06:50.077 --> 06:51.945
You're a smart boy.

06:51.945 --> 06:55.048
- I was hopin' I'd never have
to see one of my boys die.

06:59.252 --> 07:00.353
I wasn't ready for it.

07:01.455 --> 07:04.091
- You're never ready for it.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.559
- Amen to that.

07:05.593 --> 07:06.960
- Uncle Frank was a sheriff.

07:08.395 --> 07:10.764
- Well, he was but that
don't matter to some people.

07:12.733 --> 07:15.703
- Well, me and
Emmett's gonna join up.

07:16.870 --> 07:18.305
- Are you gonna
be a sheriff too?

07:19.607 --> 07:20.941
- That's right.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.944
That way we can track
down who killed Frank.

07:23.944 --> 07:25.946
- And it'll all be legal.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.649
(pensive music)

07:32.620 --> 07:33.453
- Julia?

07:33.453 --> 07:34.755
- Yes, Emmett?

07:34.755 --> 07:36.456
- I'm gon' love you forever.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.291
- Don't say that, Emmett.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.561
Who knows what'll
happen in the future.

07:40.594 --> 07:42.162
You could meet a pretty
girl tomorrow mornin'

07:42.162 --> 07:44.765
that makes you
forget all about me.

07:44.798 --> 07:46.266
- That's impossible.

07:46.266 --> 07:48.301
- Here you are promisin'
the world again,

07:48.301 --> 07:51.138
but you just don't know.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.340
- Julia Johnson,
will you marry--

07:53.406 --> 07:54.241
- Whoa!

07:54.241 --> 07:55.142
No way.

07:55.142 --> 07:56.176
You can't do that.

07:56.243 --> 07:57.645
You don't even have a ring.

08:00.614 --> 08:02.516
Did you plan this?

08:02.516 --> 08:04.484
- Well, no.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.620
- [Julia] You haven't
even asked my father?

08:07.821 --> 08:09.990
- Do I really need
to ask your father?

08:09.990 --> 08:12.125
- Yes, you most certainly do.

08:12.159 --> 08:14.294
What are you doin' Emmett?

08:14.294 --> 08:15.428
- I have no idea.

08:16.530 --> 08:18.599
I just want you to
know that I love you.

08:18.632 --> 08:21.001
- [Julia] You
can't just do that.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.469
- Do what?

08:22.502 --> 08:25.973
- You can't just act when
somethin' pops into your head.

08:25.973 --> 08:27.340
Life doesn't work that way.

08:29.376 --> 08:30.477
- Who says?

08:30.510 --> 08:31.344
(Julia groans)

08:31.344 --> 08:32.546
- Emmett.

08:32.613 --> 08:34.682
- I'll do anything
to be with you.

08:34.682 --> 08:36.516
What's so wrong with that?

08:36.550 --> 08:38.385
- Unbridled passion
doesn't leave room

08:38.451 --> 08:42.289
for common sense, Emmett
and honestly it scares me.

08:43.290 --> 08:45.292
If you really wanna marry me,

08:45.325 --> 08:48.028
you need to grow up and
start doin' things right.

08:49.229 --> 08:50.397
I have to get home.

08:50.397 --> 08:51.398
Pa will be waiting.

08:51.464 --> 08:52.633
- [Emmett] I'll walk you.

08:52.633 --> 08:53.701
- With a shotgun.

08:54.568 --> 08:56.570
- I'll see you tomorrow.

08:56.637 --> 09:01.541
(gentle music)
(grass rustling)

09:23.897 --> 09:28.902
(crickets chirping)
(gentle music)

09:43.784 --> 09:45.285
(Bob groans)

09:45.352 --> 09:49.022
- Don't let it get the best
of you, Bob. (Emmett laughs)

09:50.190 --> 09:52.893
(Bob yells)

09:52.926 --> 09:55.028
- Calm down, calm down.

09:55.028 --> 09:57.230
Let me see this darn thing.

09:59.099 --> 09:59.933
(Bob grunts)

09:59.933 --> 10:00.934
(Emmett laughs)

10:00.968 --> 10:02.202
Calm down, Bob.

10:03.436 --> 10:05.538
- Let me see if I
can get it started.

10:05.538 --> 10:08.541
(crickets chirping)

10:10.778 --> 10:12.545
- [Emmett] Oh.

10:12.545 --> 10:13.480
There it goes.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.082
- [Bob] No it ain't, you lie.

10:15.115 --> 10:16.784
- No, I ain't lyin' there boy.
- You lie.

10:16.784 --> 10:17.718
You lie.

10:17.718 --> 10:18.886
You know how I know you lie?

10:18.919 --> 10:20.220
- Why?
- Your lips are movin'.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.223
(crickets chirping)

10:26.760 --> 10:27.661
Come on now.

10:27.661 --> 10:29.229
Ain't got all night.

10:29.262 --> 10:32.265
(crickets chirping)

10:34.467 --> 10:35.502
- You heard.

10:35.568 --> 10:38.505
(crickets chirping)

10:42.075 --> 10:43.911
- We can find
somethin' that'll burn.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.313
That ain't gonna burn.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.148
What's this shit?

10:48.148 --> 10:49.649
Oh, shit.

10:49.649 --> 10:54.154
(fire crackling)
(crickets chirping)

10:54.187 --> 10:56.957
- "Oh Emmett, I can't
do it, I can't do it.

10:56.990 --> 10:58.992
"Oh, Emmett, I can't do it."

10:58.992 --> 11:00.260
(Grat laughs)
(Emmett laughs)

11:00.293 --> 11:01.929
- Shut the hell up!

11:01.929 --> 11:06.934
(crickets chirping)
(fire crackling)

11:15.809 --> 11:17.044
(Grat chuckles)

11:17.044 --> 11:18.545
(Bob chuckles)

11:18.611 --> 11:23.616
(hooves clomping)
(pensive music)

11:24.484 --> 11:27.054
(twig snaps)
(pensive music)

11:27.054 --> 11:28.555
- What is it, Bob?

11:30.891 --> 11:32.659
- I could swear I saw somethin'.

11:33.827 --> 11:38.565
(pensive music)
(crickets chirping)

11:49.743 --> 11:51.178
Someone's messin' with us.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.148
- I think I heard it, too.

11:59.753 --> 12:00.921
- Give me three, two, one.

12:03.590 --> 12:04.892
- Three,

12:04.892 --> 12:06.326
two,

12:06.359 --> 12:07.194
one.

12:07.194 --> 12:09.696
(shots firing)

12:12.900 --> 12:17.905
(crickets chirping)
(fire crackling)

12:22.075 --> 12:23.410
- I think we got him.

12:23.410 --> 12:28.415
(fire crackling)
(crickets chirping)

12:30.918 --> 12:32.085
- Follow me, fellows.

12:32.085 --> 12:36.857
(fire crackling)
(crickets chirping)

12:58.411 --> 13:00.747
(pensive music)

13:00.747 --> 13:02.983
Damn, it's Towerly!

13:04.284 --> 13:05.886
- We just got lucky, fellas.

13:08.588 --> 13:09.957
- We just got us some money.

13:15.428 --> 13:18.098
(pensive music)

13:19.666 --> 13:21.835
- What you mean
there's no money?

13:21.902 --> 13:22.735
- Nothin'?

13:26.306 --> 13:27.507
- Sorry, boys.

13:27.507 --> 13:28.808
That note is only
good for a year.

13:31.178 --> 13:32.679
(horse whinnies)

13:32.745 --> 13:35.815
- Why the hell did you plant
those things to begin with?

13:35.815 --> 13:36.649
- Come on, Bob.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.484
Let's go.

13:37.484 --> 13:39.019
- I'm not done yet!

13:39.086 --> 13:40.487
- Bob, don't.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.789
- You almost got us
killed, did you know that?

13:42.822 --> 13:46.659
- Look, I'm very grateful for
all that you boys have done.

13:46.659 --> 13:49.796
The man was on the
run for over a year.

13:49.796 --> 13:51.631
The money that was
set aside for that

13:51.631 --> 13:53.133
had to be used for other things.

13:53.133 --> 13:55.002
You know how politicians are.

13:55.002 --> 13:55.969
My hands are tied.

13:56.003 --> 13:57.670
I had no control over that.

13:57.670 --> 13:59.506
If y'all'd agot him
a couple months ago

13:59.506 --> 14:00.673
it'd had been all right.

14:00.707 --> 14:01.875
- You son of a bitch.

14:01.942 --> 14:04.144
You spent it on
yourself didn't ya?

14:05.478 --> 14:06.479
(Mitchell sighs)

14:06.479 --> 14:07.680
We've been loyal to you.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.016
For almost two years
we've been puttin'

14:09.016 --> 14:10.650
our ass on the line for you.

14:10.683 --> 14:12.819
- Always the same with
you, ain't it, Bob?

14:12.819 --> 14:14.955
The world's out to get ya.
You're just a model citizen.

14:16.556 --> 14:18.291
I tell you what,
you're all fired.

14:18.325 --> 14:19.459
Get out!

14:19.459 --> 14:20.693
- But you still owe us.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.495
- Yeah, you can't just do that.

14:22.529 --> 14:26.033
- Look, you know what the
Marshals are sayin' don't ya?

14:26.033 --> 14:27.567
They're sayin' the Dalton
boys are up to no good.

14:27.634 --> 14:29.469
I hear tell y'all been out

14:29.502 --> 14:32.405
there sellin' whiskey
on Indian territory.

14:32.405 --> 14:35.308
- Is that what this is about?

14:35.342 --> 14:37.210
- Sir, we really need the money.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.211
I plan on gettin' married when

14:38.211 --> 14:40.513
we get back to Coffeyville.

14:40.547 --> 14:43.816
- Get out of my
office all of you.

14:43.816 --> 14:44.985
- But Sheriff--

14:46.153 --> 14:48.922
- The Dalton boys are
hereby relieved of duty.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.992
- You're not relievin'
the Dalton boys of shit!

14:52.025 --> 14:53.193
We quit.

14:53.226 --> 14:57.864
(badges clattering)
(pensive music)

14:59.066 --> 14:59.899
Asshole.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.502
(pensive music)

15:21.254 --> 15:23.256
- You fellows wanna talk to me?

15:23.256 --> 15:24.191
- Yes, Sir.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.625
Thank you for makin' time.

15:25.625 --> 15:27.560
- I guess you heard
about our brother, Frank.

15:27.594 --> 15:28.428
- I did.

15:29.862 --> 15:34.534
Sorry about your loss but I
heard you brought in a killer.

15:34.534 --> 15:35.368
- They did.

15:38.471 --> 15:41.074
- I guess you heard
about Sheriff Mitchell.

15:41.108 --> 15:44.044
- No, I ain't heard
anything about the Sheriff.

15:44.044 --> 15:45.245
What about him?

15:45.278 --> 15:47.114
- The old bastard's
holdin' out on us.

15:48.715 --> 15:50.717
- Says he's not gonna
pay us the reward.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.287
- How much was the reward?

15:54.287 --> 15:55.722
- $2,000.

15:58.558 --> 16:00.260
- Fair piece of change.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.462
Why's he say he's not payin' it?

16:03.963 --> 16:06.799
- On account of the reward
notice is over a year old.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.501
- He says it ain't
no good no more.

16:09.736 --> 16:12.239
- The old bastard's
keepin' it for himself.

16:12.239 --> 16:15.108
- That's mighty strong
words, Mr. Dalton.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.478
I've known Mitchell for years.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.813
I don't think it's
in his character.

16:22.015 --> 16:23.483
- Marshal, what
we'd like to know,

16:23.483 --> 16:26.086
do we have any recourse
through your office?

16:26.119 --> 16:28.455
- Unfortunately, the
reward wasn't issued

16:28.455 --> 16:29.956
through our office.

16:29.989 --> 16:34.027
If it was it'd be backed
by the U.S. government.

16:34.027 --> 16:35.362
- Well who's backin' it up?

16:37.597 --> 16:38.765
- Probably the county.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.003
- So then we can't
do anything about it?

16:44.003 --> 16:47.707
- Well each county
writes its own rules,

16:47.774 --> 16:49.109
but the important thing

16:49.142 --> 16:52.779
is that you boys stay
in law enforcement.

16:52.779 --> 16:54.881
It'll be good for
ya in the long run.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.550
- We already quit.

16:59.619 --> 17:00.887
- That's unfortunate.

17:10.163 --> 17:12.732
(gentle music)

17:19.539 --> 17:20.707
- [Curtis] Mr. Knowles,

17:20.707 --> 17:23.042
I know these time
locks are a good idea,

17:24.377 --> 17:26.846
but can't we do
somethin' about the cost?

17:30.550 --> 17:34.721
- Senator, there's a
lot involved in this.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.889
I can make the
October 1st deadline

17:36.889 --> 17:40.660
for delivery to the First
National Bank as you requested,

17:40.693 --> 17:44.597
however, once the
mechanicals are delivered,

17:44.597 --> 17:46.866
I'll have to engage
my technical man

17:46.899 --> 17:48.601
to travel to Coffeyville.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.438
He has to engineer the
device at your facility

17:51.438 --> 17:54.607
to the specifications of
that particular vault.

17:54.607 --> 17:57.877
So the device will be delivered
on the first of October

17:57.910 --> 18:00.046
and he will be there
at some point during

18:00.046 --> 18:02.549
that first week to
complete the installation.

18:03.750 --> 18:05.252
- Understood.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.287
What can I do to make
this run smoothly?

18:08.421 --> 18:10.123
- I would strongly suggest that

18:10.190 --> 18:13.860
you bring one of your trusted
employees up here to Topeka

18:13.893 --> 18:16.062
so that my office can train them

18:16.095 --> 18:20.600
on the day to day
operations of the time log.

18:20.600 --> 18:21.701
- That's a good idea.

18:23.270 --> 18:26.239
- No extra charge for
that training of course.

18:26.239 --> 18:27.607
Do you have someone in mind?

18:28.941 --> 18:29.876
- I think so.

18:34.614 --> 18:38.218
So Rebecca, is this your
first trip to Topeka?

18:38.251 --> 18:40.253
- Yes, Sir.
- [Curtis] So what'd ya think?

18:40.287 --> 18:43.055
- It's a right
big town, Senator.

18:43.055 --> 18:44.957
- Compared to Coffeyville it is.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.161
How long you been workin'
with us at the bank?

18:48.228 --> 18:50.997
- My 10th anniversary
was last year.

18:50.997 --> 18:52.999
- That's great, that's great.

18:52.999 --> 18:55.134
You've done some mighty
fine work for us.

18:55.134 --> 18:57.404
You brought a lot of
business into the bank too

18:57.437 --> 18:59.272
and we're much appreciative.

18:59.306 --> 19:02.742
So how's it feel bein' the
first lady assistant manager

19:02.742 --> 19:04.010
in this bank's history?

19:04.010 --> 19:07.514
- Oh, I take the
responsibility very seriously.

19:07.580 --> 19:09.316
- I'm sure you do.

19:09.316 --> 19:11.184
Rebecca, I sent for you because

19:11.251 --> 19:13.586
there's a company here in Topeka

19:13.586 --> 19:18.358
that manufacturers reliable
time locks for bank vaults.

19:19.526 --> 19:21.628
- What would that do for us?

19:21.661 --> 19:23.963
- The locks would be automatic.

19:23.963 --> 19:26.699
That means that no
one, not even me,

19:26.699 --> 19:29.269
would have access after hours.

19:30.470 --> 19:31.971
- Okay.

19:32.004 --> 19:35.174
- I have set up a meeting
for you with this company,

19:35.174 --> 19:38.845
and at this meeting you
will learn the why's,

19:38.845 --> 19:43.850
wherefores, ins and outs of
dealing with these time locks.

19:44.551 --> 19:45.485
- Certainly, Sir.

19:45.518 --> 19:46.453
When am I supposed to be gettin'

19:46.453 --> 19:47.954
this lock at the First National?

19:47.987 --> 19:49.188
- It'll be the same time

19:49.188 --> 19:52.459
as the bank across the
street, October the 1st.

19:52.492 --> 19:55.161
(pensive music)

20:08.875 --> 20:12.211
- You boys want any more out
of life than what we have?

20:12.245 --> 20:13.480
- I wanna get rich and sleep

20:13.513 --> 20:15.315
with a different
whore every night.

20:15.315 --> 20:17.850
(all laughing)

20:19.218 --> 20:21.521
- I just wanna make
an honest livin'.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.189
Buy some land.

20:23.189 --> 20:24.324
- What if I told
you I could make

20:24.324 --> 20:26.326
both of your dreams come true?

20:26.326 --> 20:29.161
- Then I'd reckon Emmett would
wanna switch dreams with me.

20:29.161 --> 20:31.664
- No, I wouldn't
you dirty old dog.

20:31.664 --> 20:33.500
- "Oh Julia, oh Julia!"

20:33.500 --> 20:37.337
(Bob laughs)
(Grat laughs)

20:37.370 --> 20:38.705
- Grat.

20:38.738 --> 20:40.106
- Listen.

20:40.106 --> 20:42.074
How much were we
supposed to get paid

20:42.074 --> 20:44.344
for haulin' in that bandit?

20:44.377 --> 20:47.213
- That bounty was $2,000.

20:47.246 --> 20:49.081
- How much did that
bandit have to steal

20:49.081 --> 20:52.685
to get that kinda
bounty on his head?

20:52.685 --> 20:54.354
- Over 50,000 I'll say.

20:57.056 --> 20:58.558
- What, Bob?

20:58.591 --> 21:01.761
- Boys, it seems like we on
the wrong side of the law.

21:02.895 --> 21:05.798
- What are you suggestin'?

21:05.798 --> 21:06.799
(Bob chuckles)

21:06.866 --> 21:08.435
- Let's be outlaws.

21:09.802 --> 21:12.138
- Different whore every night?

21:12.138 --> 21:12.972
- Two.

21:13.039 --> 21:14.206
(Grat chuckles)

21:14.206 --> 21:15.074
- I'm in.

21:15.107 --> 21:16.376
(Bob chuckles)

21:16.376 --> 21:17.744
- I can't be an outlaw.

21:17.777 --> 21:19.211
You crazy?

21:19.211 --> 21:21.481
- Come on little brother,
we'll look after ya.

21:21.481 --> 21:22.982
- Damn right.

21:22.982 --> 21:26.453
- I'm gonna find a good job
and I'm gonna marry Julia.

21:26.453 --> 21:28.955
- Believe me, Emmett, once
you get a taste of this,

21:28.955 --> 21:31.624
you won't care anything
about that girl.

21:31.624 --> 21:33.059
- I'm gonna spend the
rest of my life with her

21:33.092 --> 21:35.328
and that means bein' a man.

21:35.328 --> 21:36.829
(Bob sighs)

21:36.829 --> 21:39.666
- Well, I thought you was
a whole lot more loyal.

21:39.666 --> 21:41.468
- I am loyal to you, Bob.

21:43.135 --> 21:44.003
- Nevermind.

21:44.070 --> 21:46.138
Just, just go.

21:46.138 --> 21:47.139
- [Emmett] Well I am.

21:52.244 --> 21:53.480
- Go home, Emmett.

21:53.480 --> 21:54.981
Your future wife's
waitin' on you.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.816
- Yeah, just go.

21:56.816 --> 21:59.819
- Emmett, don't tell anyone
what we just talked about.

22:02.188 --> 22:04.857
(belt clinking)

22:07.093 --> 22:08.861
He better not tell Mama.

22:08.861 --> 22:11.163
- He's gon' tell everyone
if you don't watch him.

22:14.501 --> 22:16.002
- Why the hell we gotta do
all this target practicin'?

22:16.035 --> 22:19.606
- 'Cause we gon' be goin' up
against some badass shooters.

22:19.639 --> 22:21.140
- Well, we're pretty
good ourselves.

22:21.140 --> 22:22.975
- Yeah, but we gotta get better.

22:23.009 --> 22:24.677
- Quit your
bellyachin' and shoot.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.213
(shots firing)

22:34.487 --> 22:37.023
(gentle music)

23:03.315 --> 23:04.917
You miss her don't you?

23:04.917 --> 23:05.752
- No.

23:13.426 --> 23:14.527
Look at this.

23:18.030 --> 23:20.032
- Here's where we start.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.367
The early train
rides right by here,

23:21.367 --> 23:25.371
and there won't be
a soul in sight.

23:25.404 --> 23:26.873
Now I'll take the lead.

23:26.873 --> 23:28.575
- What, wait, what?

23:28.575 --> 23:30.577
You said I can take the lead.

23:30.610 --> 23:32.178
- I changed my mind.

23:32.211 --> 23:33.846
- Why am I not surprised?

23:33.846 --> 23:36.516
You always need the
glory don't ya, brother?

23:36.549 --> 23:38.384
- Grat, you don't know
what you're talkin' about.

23:38.417 --> 23:41.754
- I'm talkin' about you
hoggin' all the glory.

23:41.754 --> 23:43.756
You been doin' it
since we was kids!

23:43.756 --> 23:44.757
- You wanna lead?

23:44.757 --> 23:46.759
Do you wanna lead, Grat?

23:48.595 --> 23:49.796
Who do you think is gonna be

23:49.862 --> 23:52.231
the first man shot
dead if they see us?

23:56.769 --> 23:59.872
I'm leadin' this because
you two are my brothers.

23:59.906 --> 24:01.107
My flesh and blood.

24:02.709 --> 24:04.477
- Can I ask a question?

24:04.477 --> 24:06.979
What are we talkin' about here?

24:07.046 --> 24:08.581
- Robbin' a train.

24:13.720 --> 24:15.054
- No we're not.

24:15.087 --> 24:17.089
- Ah, I don't know.

24:18.257 --> 24:20.426
- Well, what do you
want outta life?

24:20.426 --> 24:21.728
- I'm not sure anymore.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.230
- What if I said you
could have anything

24:24.230 --> 24:26.132
that little head of
yours can dream of?

24:26.999 --> 24:28.167
- I guess I'd like that.

24:30.903 --> 24:33.239
- I need you onboard
little brother.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.742
- I can't.

24:35.775 --> 24:36.743
- What?

24:37.844 --> 24:39.178
- You need to think
hard about this.

24:39.178 --> 24:40.112
- How could I?

24:40.146 --> 24:41.648
Could you imagine the papers?

24:41.648 --> 24:44.150
The Dalton boys steal
from little old ladies.

24:44.183 --> 24:48.855
Wait, I refuse until we
get a real outlaw name.

24:52.759 --> 24:53.960
The Dalton Gang.

24:55.194 --> 24:57.029
- Hm, the Dalton Gang?

24:57.096 --> 24:58.531
I like that.

24:58.531 --> 24:59.365
- I love it.

24:59.431 --> 25:01.868
(Bob chuckles)

25:01.868 --> 25:03.202
- Let's just make
sure it shows up

25:03.269 --> 25:04.303
in the papers like that.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.138
- That a boy, Emmett.

25:06.138 --> 25:07.640
- Hell yeah, brother.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.175
- The Dalton Gang.

25:10.643 --> 25:13.012
- Well, Skeeter, what is it
you wanna talk to me about?

25:13.012 --> 25:14.480
- Well, Papa?

25:14.513 --> 25:15.648
- Yeah?

25:15.648 --> 25:18.050
- Why you gotta chase the train?

25:18.050 --> 25:21.320
- Well, we gon' have to stop it.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.189
- Well, why you
gotta stop the train?

25:26.192 --> 25:27.727
- Probably a lotta money on it.

25:29.128 --> 25:30.630
- I thought you was good guys.

25:32.331 --> 25:33.666
- Well, we are the good guys.

25:33.700 --> 25:35.968
Sometimes we have
to change sides.

25:37.036 --> 25:38.871
- Oh, okay.

25:38.871 --> 25:40.239
So are you a robber?

25:44.711 --> 25:45.812
- Somethin' like that.

25:47.379 --> 25:48.214
- Oh.

25:50.549 --> 25:53.152
(gentle music)

26:04.396 --> 26:05.397
- Good to see you, Caleb.

26:05.397 --> 26:07.099
What you need?

26:07.166 --> 26:09.769
- Railroad's got me goin'
up and down them big hills

26:09.769 --> 26:12.104
just outside of Joplin again.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.274
- That's your regular
route ain't it?

26:15.341 --> 26:18.678
- I'm holdin' a
trainload of passengers

26:18.678 --> 26:21.380
and the railroad wants
me to wait five hours

26:21.413 --> 26:25.618
so I can pick up the detectives
they hired for protection

26:25.618 --> 26:27.754
and that's another car for them

26:27.754 --> 26:29.588
and another car
for their horses.

26:29.622 --> 26:32.558
That's five hours
if they're on time.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.593
- What, are you worried
about the weight?

26:34.593 --> 26:36.262
- She's an old
locomotive, Marshal,

26:36.295 --> 26:38.397
and there's some days she
can't even hold her own.

26:38.430 --> 26:39.866
- Caleb, I know you don't wanna

26:39.866 --> 26:41.868
get hung up on one
of them inclines,

26:41.901 --> 26:46.072
but I think that's a decision
best left to the railroad.

26:46.072 --> 26:48.474
- I know what's best
for my train, Marshal.

26:48.474 --> 26:50.877
And that stretch of land,

26:50.910 --> 26:53.913
chance of a robbery
is very, very low.

26:53.913 --> 26:55.581
- Well, that's true.

26:55.581 --> 26:59.585
That's some very rough
terrain, but you never know.

26:59.585 --> 27:01.921
- Nothing there but
rough terrain and forest.

27:03.122 --> 27:04.824
- Well, what do
you want me to do?

27:04.824 --> 27:06.458
- I got a train
load of passengers

27:06.458 --> 27:09.061
who want to get to
their destination.

27:09.095 --> 27:10.562
You can tell those
detective boys

27:10.562 --> 27:14.400
I'll be back in about 24 hours
and they can load up then.

27:14.433 --> 27:18.104
- I can relay your message
but I cannot endorse

27:19.505 --> 27:22.675
you not havin' their kinda
security on a trip like that.

27:22.742 --> 27:24.744
- I'm not askin'
you to but thank

27:24.744 --> 27:26.345
you for your help, Marshal.

27:26.345 --> 27:31.350
(train chugging)
(wind whistling)

27:50.136 --> 27:51.003
- Let's go.

27:55.007 --> 27:56.008
- See anything yet?

27:56.042 --> 27:56.976
- Nothin' just yet.

27:58.310 --> 27:59.445
Wait.

27:59.445 --> 28:00.346
- [Grat] What is it?

28:00.346 --> 28:01.347
- [Bob] It's the train.

28:01.380 --> 28:04.116
(train chugging)

28:06.819 --> 28:09.488
(pensive music)

28:16.328 --> 28:17.629
- You see Bob and Emmett?

28:17.629 --> 28:20.066
- Yeah but they're a
pretty good piece away.

28:20.066 --> 28:22.802
(train chugging)

28:29.641 --> 28:30.810
They might make it.

28:30.810 --> 28:35.815
(upbeat music)
(train chugging)

28:50.496 --> 28:52.832
They're movin' fast
through those woods.

28:52.832 --> 28:54.433
- I see 'em now.

28:54.433 --> 28:55.401
Gon' be close.

28:55.401 --> 29:00.272
(train chugging)
(upbeat music)

30:11.143 --> 30:12.611
- They made it.

30:12.644 --> 30:13.980
- How do you know?

30:13.980 --> 30:15.447
- The train's slowin' down.

30:15.447 --> 30:18.184
(train chugging)

30:24.123 --> 30:24.957
- Sweet.

30:24.957 --> 30:27.659
(train chugging)

30:31.830 --> 30:34.500
- Hey, hey, hey, listen up.

30:34.533 --> 30:35.868
It wasn't perfect.

30:35.868 --> 30:38.370
$6,000 richer than
when we went in.

30:41.707 --> 30:42.641
Not bad, huh?

30:45.111 --> 30:46.378
And I wanna dedicate this

30:46.378 --> 30:47.980
to the person who
gave us our name.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.816
Thank you little brother.

30:50.849 --> 30:52.818
- Wait to go little shit.

30:52.818 --> 30:55.988
- And that's why half the
day's loot's goin' to you.

30:56.022 --> 30:57.023
- What?

30:57.023 --> 30:58.724
- That's really not necessary.

30:58.724 --> 31:00.359
- Damn right it's not.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.129
- Don't start with
your shit, Grat.

31:03.162 --> 31:05.831
- I rode in second,
I held up the train,

31:05.831 --> 31:07.199
I collected all the money.

31:08.700 --> 31:11.370
It don't make no sense
you do me like that.

31:11.370 --> 31:13.239
- Well, here's the good news.

31:13.305 --> 31:15.174
It don't need to
make sense to you.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.178
Sense is somethin'
that leaders have.

31:21.247 --> 31:22.915
I automatically get half.

31:22.915 --> 31:24.750
That leaves you
with nothin' today.

31:27.219 --> 31:29.055
But you got somethin'
to look forward

31:29.088 --> 31:30.589
to on the next one, Grat.

31:30.589 --> 31:35.261
And I promise you it'll be
bigger and better next time.

31:36.662 --> 31:39.331
- You think Frank
woulda acted like this?

31:39.331 --> 31:41.100
- Frank is dead!

31:41.100 --> 31:41.900
- Bobby.

31:43.235 --> 31:45.504
- Frank died without
a penny to his name,

31:46.905 --> 31:49.275
and I loved him just
as much as anyone here

31:50.209 --> 31:51.843
but he was a damn fool.

31:53.112 --> 31:55.381
He tried to do right
but the devil showed up

31:55.414 --> 31:56.748
at his door instead.

31:58.250 --> 31:59.785
I'm gon' find me a saloon
and raise me some hell.

31:59.785 --> 32:01.287
Anybody wanna go?

32:02.588 --> 32:05.224
- I believe I'm gon'
turn in for tonight.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.092
- Come on, Grat.

32:06.092 --> 32:07.926
I'll buy you a drink.

32:11.730 --> 32:13.132
Last chance little brother.

32:14.300 --> 32:15.968
- All right, all right.

32:16.035 --> 32:16.868
I'll go.

32:20.372 --> 32:23.542
- Oh, well, hell, let's
get together next week.

32:23.542 --> 32:24.376
Sound good?

32:24.376 --> 32:27.279
(patrons chattering)

32:29.381 --> 32:32.718
- Hm, looks like them
Dalton boys found themselves

32:32.718 --> 32:34.220
a good payday somewhere.

32:34.220 --> 32:38.424
- Aye, and they can stay until
their pot of gold runs out.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.727
- Kinda makes you
wonder thought don't it?

32:41.727 --> 32:43.795
- What are ya gettin' at?

32:43.795 --> 32:47.133
- That was a big damn
train robbery yesterday.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.335
- I thought that was
down the road a stretch?

32:50.769 --> 32:53.839
- It was but only
about a day's ride.

32:53.839 --> 32:55.841
They had plenty of
time to get here.

32:56.942 --> 32:59.011
- Marshal, do you really think

32:59.011 --> 33:03.315
that these boys could
manage somethin' like that?

33:03.315 --> 33:05.517
- Well, I hope not especially

33:05.584 --> 33:07.753
with their background
in law enforcement.

33:09.955 --> 33:11.157
Who knows.

33:11.157 --> 33:12.591
- I don't know.

33:12.624 --> 33:14.460
Bob and I do go a way back.

33:16.328 --> 33:17.996
- I understand.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.631
Would you do me favor?

33:19.665 --> 33:22.101
- What you be needin'?

33:22.101 --> 33:25.171
- Just kinda keep a tally on
what they're spendin' tonight.

33:25.171 --> 33:28.507
I'll come by tomorrow
and check up.

33:28.507 --> 33:30.109
- Aye, that I can do.

33:31.177 --> 33:32.010
- Ma'am.

33:33.812 --> 33:34.880
- Marshal.

33:34.880 --> 33:36.682
- Evenin' fellas.

33:36.682 --> 33:38.016
Enjoy yourselves.

33:39.185 --> 33:40.886
- What you say your name was?

33:40.952 --> 33:43.155
- Anne, for only the third time.

33:46.125 --> 33:48.894
- Anne, have you met
my little brother?

33:48.894 --> 33:49.861
This is Emmett.

33:51.463 --> 33:52.731
- He's so cute.

33:52.731 --> 33:54.466
- Cute ain't the word for him.

33:54.500 --> 33:56.968
He saved my life earlier today.

33:57.969 --> 33:59.638
Say Pam--

33:59.671 --> 34:01.006
- It's Anne.

34:01.006 --> 34:02.508
- Whatever.

34:02.508 --> 34:05.311
Why don't you take Emmett
up and show him a good time?

34:05.311 --> 34:08.714
- No, no, no, no, that
would not be necessary.

34:08.714 --> 34:09.815
- What?

34:09.848 --> 34:11.750
You don't like what you see?

34:11.750 --> 34:15.254
- No, I mean, yes, I
mean, damn you, Bob.

34:15.254 --> 34:17.656
- Look, my brother just had
the best day of his life.

34:17.689 --> 34:20.992
It would be a shame if
tonight was any different.

34:22.528 --> 34:23.762
- Come with me.

34:23.762 --> 34:25.331
- I really--
(Bridget laughs)

34:25.364 --> 34:27.366
- Do your thing, Pam.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.235
- Bob, you son of a bitch.

34:29.235 --> 34:30.869
- Got a name Mr. Emmett?

34:31.903 --> 34:33.004
- Yes.

34:34.240 --> 34:37.243
- Well, care to
share it with me?

34:37.243 --> 34:39.745
- Oh yeah, it's Dalton.

34:39.745 --> 34:41.380
Emmett Dalton.

34:41.380 --> 34:42.914
- That's nice.

34:42.914 --> 34:46.252
Now Emmett Dalton, take
these clothes off me.

34:48.587 --> 34:51.290
Okay, then I'll take
them off myself.

34:51.357 --> 34:52.358
- Wait.

34:52.391 --> 34:53.292
- What?

34:53.292 --> 34:54.126
What is it?

34:55.527 --> 34:56.895
- I just can't.

34:56.928 --> 34:57.763
- [Anne] Why?

34:59.931 --> 35:02.468
- I just, there's someone else.

35:03.469 --> 35:05.471
- Oh, you're married?

35:07.105 --> 35:08.039
- No.

35:09.475 --> 35:10.976
- Engaged?

35:11.042 --> 35:12.811
- Well, no.

35:14.280 --> 35:15.614
- So you have a girlfriend?

35:15.647 --> 35:16.482
- I think so.

35:18.450 --> 35:21.620
- Emmett Dalton,
you're so sweet.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.626
You're really in
love with someone.

35:29.461 --> 35:31.129
- Yeah.

35:31.129 --> 35:32.631
Yeah, guess I am.

35:37.936 --> 35:40.506
(gentle music)

35:47.513 --> 35:49.848
- Caleb, I'm pourin'
myself a little brandy.

35:49.915 --> 35:51.250
Would you care for some?

35:51.283 --> 35:53.752
- Thank you Senator
but unfortunately

35:53.752 --> 35:55.654
I am still technically on duty.

35:57.088 --> 36:01.927
- Well, the boss said it's
okay, so with my permission...

36:02.661 --> 36:04.796
(brandy sloshing)

36:07.666 --> 36:08.834
- [Caleb] Thank you, Senator.

36:12.804 --> 36:14.039
- So Caleb, why
don't you tell me

36:14.039 --> 36:15.774
in your own words what happened

36:15.807 --> 36:17.776
when those bandits
hit your tain?

36:17.776 --> 36:21.447
- Well Sir, there is a good
side and there is a bad side.

36:21.447 --> 36:25.851
The bad side is those fellas
got away with a lot of money.

36:25.851 --> 36:27.653
- How much you think
they got away with?

36:27.686 --> 36:31.290
- Difficult to say, Sir, but
it had to be in the thousands.

36:31.290 --> 36:34.192
The train was full
and passengers said

36:34.192 --> 36:35.627
they went around to everyone.

36:37.296 --> 36:38.530
- Well, the
railroad's gonna have

36:38.530 --> 36:40.999
to reimburse everyone
of those passengers

36:41.032 --> 36:43.735
and it's gon' be based
on their statements.

36:43.735 --> 36:45.070
So it can get kinda tricky.

36:46.305 --> 36:48.674
So, what's the good side?

36:48.707 --> 36:51.710
- The good side is
no one got hurt.

36:51.710 --> 36:53.845
It could've been much worse.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.214
- That is good.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.484
You know, I can't
believe they chased

36:58.517 --> 37:01.186
that train down in that terrain.

37:01.186 --> 37:04.356
- Those heavy hills are
hard even for a locomotive.

37:04.390 --> 37:05.857
They had to work for this.

37:05.857 --> 37:08.760
They knew what they were doing.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.829
- Marshal Fuller told
me that you decided

37:10.862 --> 37:13.231
not to wait for the
detectives to join you.

37:15.200 --> 37:18.169
- A number of passengers
were getting restless.

37:19.405 --> 37:22.841
And I'm not so sure that having

37:22.874 --> 37:25.544
those detectives there
would've been a great idea.

37:26.412 --> 37:27.879
- Well, why not?

37:27.879 --> 37:30.716
- These fellows were well
trained professionals.

37:32.217 --> 37:35.120
This was a well
planned operation.

37:35.120 --> 37:38.757
If a gun fight had erupted
inside or around the train,

37:38.757 --> 37:41.360
there's no telling
what could've happened.

37:41.393 --> 37:42.861
- That brings me to
another question,

37:42.861 --> 37:46.632
one that the other engineers
and I have been askin'.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.300
- Let me guess.

37:48.367 --> 37:51.403
You're thinking of
arming the train crews?

37:51.437 --> 37:54.072
- So what are your
thoughts on that?

37:54.072 --> 37:57.242
- We used to do that
right after the war

37:57.275 --> 38:00.245
when the main problem
was with the Indians.

38:00.245 --> 38:05.050
- So as one of our most
experienced engineers,

38:05.050 --> 38:07.118
would you like a
pistol and a shotgun

38:07.118 --> 38:09.721
to accompany ya
in your journeys?

38:09.755 --> 38:11.923
- Let me say this Senator,

38:11.923 --> 38:15.627
if every outlaw
followed some type

38:15.627 --> 38:20.632
of creed as these boys did,
then the answer would be no,

38:21.800 --> 38:24.135
but some outlaws
can be much worse.

38:24.135 --> 38:26.438
- Guess that's the essence
of bein' an outlaw.

38:27.473 --> 38:28.807
- Understanding that I

38:28.807 --> 38:31.910
would sincerely
appreciate the weaponry.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.981
(gentle music)

38:40.018 --> 38:44.690
- [Skeeter] Pew, pew,
pew, pew, pew, pew!

38:45.857 --> 38:50.862
Pew, pew, pew,
pew, pew, pew, pew!

38:50.862 --> 38:55.867
Pew, pew, pew, pew, pew,
pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!

38:56.502 --> 38:58.770
(birds chirping)

39:05.844 --> 39:07.479
Pew, pew, pew!

39:07.513 --> 39:10.281
- Why is he wearin' that
on his face, Elizabeth?

39:10.281 --> 39:12.451
- Pretendin' to be a bandit.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.820
He's been runnin' around
all day tellin' everyone

39:14.853 --> 39:16.455
he wants their money.

39:16.455 --> 39:17.856
- Oh, really?

39:17.856 --> 39:20.358
He must be hearin' things
people have been talkin' about.

39:20.358 --> 39:22.828
- He never played
like this before.

39:22.861 --> 39:25.531
Wonder where he
got that idea from.

39:25.531 --> 39:27.699
- I have no idea.

39:27.699 --> 39:28.900
Come here, boy.

39:28.900 --> 39:31.903
- [Skeeter] Pew, pew,
pew, pew, pew, pew!

39:31.903 --> 39:34.205
- Why are you dressed like that?

39:34.205 --> 39:35.707
- [Skeeter] I'm a robber.

39:35.707 --> 39:36.908
- A robber?

39:36.975 --> 39:38.977
- Yeah, I'm gonna
rob me a train.

39:40.245 --> 39:42.648
When I grow up I'm
gonna join a gang.

39:42.681 --> 39:47.486
(Bob chuckles)
(birds chirping)

39:47.486 --> 39:48.987
(Bob sighs)

39:48.987 --> 39:53.024
- [Skeeter] Pew, pew,
pew, pew, pew, pew!

39:53.058 --> 39:56.061
(crickets chirping)

40:07.873 --> 40:09.274
- What's wrong with him?

40:09.274 --> 40:11.743
- He's afraid you're
gonna be mad at him.

40:12.611 --> 40:13.612
(Bob sighs)

40:13.612 --> 40:14.946
- What did he do?

40:15.013 --> 40:17.516
- He found somethin'
in the back yard.

40:17.549 --> 40:18.950
He dug it up.

40:18.950 --> 40:20.519
- What'd you find, Skeeter?

40:20.552 --> 40:21.386
- Nothin'.

40:24.022 --> 40:25.056
- A lot of money.

40:27.693 --> 40:29.294
- Yeah, I know.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.964
- Why is there money
buried in the backyard?

40:34.232 --> 40:36.101
- I'm runnin' outta
places to stash it.

40:37.368 --> 40:38.704
- What about the bank?

40:40.939 --> 40:42.708
- I don't think
that's a good idea.

40:44.309 --> 40:45.611
- Do your brothers have piles

40:45.611 --> 40:47.579
of money laying
around like this?

40:48.547 --> 40:49.748
- Uh, yeah.

40:49.781 --> 40:51.282
We've been at this for awhile.

40:55.386 --> 40:56.988
- How 'bout if I go to the bank?

40:58.790 --> 40:59.925
- I don't know.

40:59.925 --> 41:00.892
Maybe some of it.

41:02.160 --> 41:05.430
- Well, you need
to talk to Skeeter.

41:05.463 --> 41:07.899
- Skeeter, you didn't
do anything wrong.

41:08.734 --> 41:09.568
- Okay.

41:09.568 --> 41:11.670
Can I ask you somethin'?

41:11.670 --> 41:12.904
- Sure.

41:12.938 --> 41:14.472
- Can I buy somethin'?

41:15.306 --> 41:17.909
(Bob chuckles)

41:19.477 --> 41:21.580
- Where'd he run off to now?

41:21.580 --> 41:22.413
- Skeeter!

41:26.484 --> 41:27.318
- Hey!

41:28.319 --> 41:29.755
- You frightened me.

41:29.788 --> 41:31.189
- Get down off of that thing!

41:40.131 --> 41:43.034
Skeeter, go on over to
the store with your mama.

41:43.034 --> 41:44.936
She might get you somethin'.

41:44.970 --> 41:46.872
- What you gonna be
doin' in town, Bob?

41:46.872 --> 41:48.707
- I'm goin' to see
Cricket at livery.

41:48.707 --> 41:49.975
- I think I'm gonna go talk

41:50.008 --> 41:51.977
to the girls at
the general store.

41:51.977 --> 41:53.478
Maybe get him somethin'.

41:53.478 --> 41:54.980
- Okay.

41:55.013 --> 41:58.349
(leaves crunching)

41:58.349 --> 42:00.485
- You better be good if
you wanna get somethin'.

42:00.518 --> 42:03.354
(leaves crunching)

42:06.124 --> 42:08.026
- [Bob] Hell up, Cricket!

42:08.026 --> 42:09.861
- Don't come any closer, Bob.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.029
I ain't got no money.

42:12.363 --> 42:14.633
- What's wrong
with you, Cricket?

42:14.666 --> 42:16.501
- What do you want?

42:16.501 --> 42:20.572
- Well, I was hopin' to pick
up a couple fresh horses.

42:20.572 --> 42:21.506
- Yeah?

42:21.539 --> 42:23.541
What you gonna use 'em for?

42:25.210 --> 42:26.077
- Business.

42:28.046 --> 42:30.548
- Would that be the
kind of business

42:30.548 --> 42:32.217
that somebody get killed for?

42:33.351 --> 42:35.386
(Bob groans)

42:35.386 --> 42:37.889
- Cricket, we've known
each other for a long time.

42:38.757 --> 42:40.425
- Things are different now.

42:42.093 --> 42:44.696
- Well, there's other
people to sell horses.

42:46.698 --> 42:49.534
- Maybe, maybe you need
to talk to one of them.

42:52.904 --> 42:55.741
(leaves crunching)

43:17.763 --> 43:19.765
- Good afternoon,
Miss Elizabeth.

43:19.798 --> 43:21.299
Haven't seen you in awhile.

43:21.299 --> 43:22.868
- Yeah, I've been
mindin' the place

43:22.901 --> 43:24.770
while Bob and the
boys have been away.

43:27.973 --> 43:30.075
- What they been doin'
while they're away?

43:31.542 --> 43:32.377
- Things.

43:33.244 --> 43:36.214
- We know what kinda things.

43:36.214 --> 43:38.283
- Look, I come in here to try

43:38.283 --> 43:39.885
to give y'all a little business.

43:41.286 --> 43:43.121
- She ain't doin'
anything wrong, Pa.

43:44.790 --> 43:45.657
Not yet.

43:47.793 --> 43:50.495
- Well, I certainly didn't
come in here to stand trial.

43:52.230 --> 43:53.298
- My father always
told me you're only

43:53.298 --> 43:55.300
as good as the company you keep.

43:56.634 --> 43:58.469
- That's right, Pa.

43:58.469 --> 44:01.673
People will judge
you by such things.

44:01.740 --> 44:04.509
- You might wanna
keep that in mind.

44:04.509 --> 44:06.845
- So, what can I help you with?

44:07.846 --> 44:09.014
- Well, I was lookin'

44:09.080 --> 44:10.782
for a little somethin'
for Skeeter here.

44:10.816 --> 44:14.085
- Well, that'd be fine if
you wanna do some shoppin'.

44:25.831 --> 44:28.767
(leaves crunching)

44:31.703 --> 44:33.471
- [Bob] Skeeter,
I thought I told

44:33.504 --> 44:34.973
you to get down off of there.

44:36.607 --> 44:37.508
- Let the boy play.

44:37.508 --> 44:38.810
He's just havin' fun.

44:47.685 --> 44:49.187
- What's wrong, Elizabeth?

44:49.187 --> 44:50.655
- I don't know if we're gonna

44:50.655 --> 44:52.557
be able to stay
in this town, Bob.

44:52.557 --> 44:55.026
People don't treat
us like they used to.

44:55.026 --> 44:56.161
- Yep.

44:56.194 --> 44:57.963
- Seems like, seems like

44:57.963 --> 45:00.698
the whole town's
turning against us.

45:00.698 --> 45:01.800
- They'll get over it.

45:04.335 --> 45:05.670
- I hope so.

45:10.541 --> 45:11.843
- Bridget McGill.

45:11.877 --> 45:14.212
It is a pleasure to
finally meet you.

45:14.212 --> 45:15.713
- Pleasure to meet
you too, Senator.

45:15.747 --> 45:16.714
- Have a seat.

45:21.319 --> 45:23.154
I thought you had an Irish name,

45:23.154 --> 45:25.490
but now that I see ya and see

45:25.523 --> 45:28.760
that hair and hear that voice--

45:28.760 --> 45:30.561
- There's no doubt about it.

45:30.561 --> 45:33.064
Well, you know what they
say about the Irish.

45:33.064 --> 45:34.866
Our feet may wander the world

45:34.900 --> 45:37.602
but our hearts are
always in Ireland.

45:37.602 --> 45:39.437
- So how long you
been in the States?

45:39.437 --> 45:40.571
- Took the boat in '80.

45:40.571 --> 45:42.207
Over a decade now.

45:42.240 --> 45:44.709
- Ireland's a beautiful country.

45:44.709 --> 45:46.945
So what would make
you leave Ireland

45:46.945 --> 45:50.415
to come halfway around the world

45:50.415 --> 45:55.086
to the vast expanses
of Coffeyville, Kansas?

45:55.120 --> 45:58.123
- Well, Sir, I was born
at a right terrible time.

45:58.123 --> 46:00.591
The Great Hunger of '47.

46:00.591 --> 46:02.027
- [Curtis] The potato famine?

46:02.894 --> 46:04.295
- Aye.

46:04.295 --> 46:07.632
Me Ma and Da suffered
through that horrible time.

46:07.632 --> 46:09.234
You can't very well run a pub

46:09.267 --> 46:11.803
when no one has a
penny for a pint.

46:11.803 --> 46:16.141
The lucky ones left
and many more died.

46:16.207 --> 46:19.377
I was the only one of the
children to make it through.

46:19.377 --> 46:20.879
God rest their souls.

46:22.480 --> 46:25.483
And then there were
fewer mouths to feed.

46:25.550 --> 46:28.619
But you be wonderin'
how I got here.

46:28.619 --> 46:31.456
You know the blight
returned in '79,

46:31.456 --> 46:33.291
but then Da had a
friend in America

46:33.324 --> 46:35.160
who was lookin' for a wife.

46:35.226 --> 46:38.396
He paid for me crossin',
and Da sent me off

46:38.429 --> 46:42.167
with the clothes on me
back, a wish and a prayer.

46:42.167 --> 46:45.270
- And that got you to New York.

46:45.303 --> 46:47.138
- Me new man tried to run a pub,

46:47.138 --> 46:50.808
but the politics there weren't
very friendly to the Irish

46:50.842 --> 46:54.179
and the peelers were
always in your business.

46:54.245 --> 46:55.746
But I already crossed the sea

46:55.780 --> 46:57.949
so we decided to cross the land.

46:57.983 --> 47:01.186
We came to Kansas City and
then down to Coffeyville.

47:01.186 --> 47:04.455
And then fortune
began to smile on us.

47:04.489 --> 47:07.325
Course we ran a
nice, clean place.

47:07.325 --> 47:10.828
He died a few years ago
and now it's all mine,

47:10.828 --> 47:13.098
down to the dust on the floor.

47:13.131 --> 47:14.832
I'd be interested in knowin' why

47:14.832 --> 47:18.303
you sent me a round trip
train ticket to come here?

47:18.336 --> 47:20.305
First class of all things.

47:20.305 --> 47:23.208
- So how long have you been
runnin' your little saloon?

47:23.208 --> 47:27.012
- The Red Branch Pub
established in '81.

47:27.012 --> 47:30.548
- Are you familiar with any
of my business dealings?

47:30.615 --> 47:33.484
- You own a big piece of
the First National Bank.

47:33.518 --> 47:36.854
- The largest part
of the bank dealings

47:36.854 --> 47:39.024
is with the railroad.

47:39.024 --> 47:41.492
- Railroad pours a lot
of money into the town.

47:41.526 --> 47:45.830
- It does and the railroad
is about to expand

47:45.830 --> 47:49.234
their operations around
the Coffeyville area.

47:49.234 --> 47:52.003
- That'll be bringin'
in more people.

47:52.037 --> 47:57.042
- More people, more
money, more opportunities,

47:57.875 --> 47:59.577
especially for folks like us.

47:59.644 --> 48:02.013
- So what are ya gettin' at?

48:02.047 --> 48:03.248
- I was wonderin' if you've

48:03.248 --> 48:05.750
ever considered
havin' a partner?

48:05.750 --> 48:10.355
- The Red Branch is doin' grand
with me as the proprietor.

48:10.388 --> 48:14.192
- I'd like to be a silent
partner in this endeavor.

48:14.192 --> 48:17.695
- Now why would I be
needin' a partner?

48:17.695 --> 48:20.198
- Bridget, I want to
expand your business.

48:20.231 --> 48:23.368
You would give me a
relatively high price

48:23.368 --> 48:25.536
for half ownership which more

48:25.536 --> 48:28.873
than likely I would
accept and then

48:28.906 --> 48:30.741
I would turn around and invest

48:30.741 --> 48:34.212
more heavily in a
larger endeavor.

48:35.180 --> 48:36.347
- What about me girls?

48:36.381 --> 48:38.449
- Oh, whoever you
want workin' with you

48:38.449 --> 48:39.550
you have workin' with you.

48:39.584 --> 48:41.352
You're the operator.

48:41.352 --> 48:43.121
You keep who you want
and you hire who you want

48:43.121 --> 48:44.789
and you fire who you want.

48:47.258 --> 48:50.695
- So, when would we
be startin' this?

48:50.695 --> 48:51.896
(Curtis sighs)

48:51.929 --> 48:56.767
- The railroad has had
two major adverse events

48:56.767 --> 48:59.870
in the past year,
two major robberies.

48:59.870 --> 49:03.074
One more event like
this and the railroad

49:03.108 --> 49:07.045
is considerin' pullin' out of
the whole Coffeyville area.

49:07.045 --> 49:08.946
- Well, what can I do
about those brigands?

49:08.946 --> 49:12.283
- The rumor is that the
Dalton Gang is responsible

49:12.283 --> 49:14.319
for both of those robberies.

49:14.385 --> 49:15.620
- Hm.

49:15.620 --> 49:18.623
But there's no actual
proof I'm thinkin'.

49:18.623 --> 49:20.125
- Correct.

49:20.125 --> 49:22.327
Are you familiar with the
members of that outfit?

49:22.393 --> 49:24.562
- I can't say that
the Dalton lads

49:24.562 --> 49:27.732
are regulars at the Red
Branch but they've been there.

49:27.765 --> 49:31.636
- You had a very
interesting clientele.

49:31.636 --> 49:33.471
I would like you to
be very observant

49:33.504 --> 49:36.341
about any potential
upcoming ventures.

49:37.775 --> 49:40.445
And you can enlist your
girls to help you with this.

49:41.646 --> 49:43.514
Bridget this could
mean a lotta money

49:43.581 --> 49:47.252
for everyone involved,
especially us.

49:49.854 --> 49:52.523
(pensive music)

50:18.049 --> 50:19.684
- Hey Lizzi.

50:19.684 --> 50:21.186
Is Julia around?

50:21.219 --> 50:23.221
- I don't know
where my sister is,

50:23.221 --> 50:25.190
but my Pa will be
back any minute

50:25.190 --> 50:27.358
and he's gon' be right
mad when he sees you.

50:31.696 --> 50:34.365
- You think she'll be
surprised to see me?

50:34.365 --> 50:35.466
- Probably.

50:35.500 --> 50:36.634
What're you doin' here?

50:38.069 --> 50:39.070
- What do you mean?

50:39.070 --> 50:39.870
I'm home.

50:41.072 --> 50:43.341
- Everyone's lookin' for
you and your brothers.

50:45.176 --> 50:46.677
- What're you talkin' about?

50:47.878 --> 50:50.315
- The whole town knows
you been stealin'.

50:50.315 --> 50:53.751
(pensive music)

50:53.751 --> 50:54.585
- But--

50:54.585 --> 50:55.553
- You need to go.

50:55.553 --> 50:56.554
My father will be here soon.

50:57.822 --> 50:59.190
- I want to see Julia.

51:00.258 --> 51:01.659
- That's impossible, Emmett.

51:01.692 --> 51:03.594
It's been too long.

51:03.594 --> 51:05.996
- It's barely more than a year.

51:06.030 --> 51:07.031
- No, Emmett.

51:07.031 --> 51:09.434
It's not possible.

51:09.434 --> 51:11.936
- What do you mean,
Lizzi, not possible?

51:13.671 --> 51:15.906
- She's gonna get
married, Emmett.

51:15.906 --> 51:18.576
(pensive music)

51:21.011 --> 51:22.180
- What?

51:22.180 --> 51:23.013
Who?

51:23.948 --> 51:26.217
- His name is Robert Lewis.

51:31.756 --> 51:33.258
He's a good man.

51:33.258 --> 51:36.361
He owns his own company
and you weren't here.

51:38.563 --> 51:40.265
- I told her I was comin' back.

51:50.074 --> 51:51.542
- Don't do anything crazy, Pa.

51:53.144 --> 51:55.146
- What is he doin' here?

51:55.213 --> 51:57.148
What the hell is goin' on?

51:57.148 --> 52:01.252
- Mr. Johnson, I'm not
here to cause no trouble.

52:01.286 --> 52:04.222
- You stay away from
my daughter you thief!

52:04.222 --> 52:06.391
- Ain't nobody wants
you here Emmett Dalton.

52:07.558 --> 52:09.427
- Mr. Johnson,
you always worried

52:09.460 --> 52:12.563
about Julia marryin'
somebody with no money.

52:12.563 --> 52:14.432
Well, I got money now.

52:14.465 --> 52:15.800
- Marryin'?

52:15.800 --> 52:17.235
You best get outta here, boy!

52:18.669 --> 52:19.770
- I ain't no boy.

52:21.239 --> 52:23.741
- You best get outta here
before things turn ugly.

52:26.811 --> 52:28.112
- I said go!

52:29.146 --> 52:33.651
- What's the problem here?

52:33.651 --> 52:35.486
- There ain't no problem.

52:35.486 --> 52:38.155
(pensive music)

52:48.499 --> 52:49.434
- [Bob] Let's get
outta here, Emmett.

52:49.434 --> 52:52.002
- I think that's a good idea.

52:55.373 --> 52:56.307
(gun cocks)

52:56.341 --> 52:58.976
(pensive music)

53:14.359 --> 53:15.960
- I told ya I'd be comin' back.

53:15.960 --> 53:17.628
I ain't no deadbeat.

53:17.662 --> 53:19.564
- That's fine and all.

53:19.564 --> 53:22.367
Don't you go treatin'
me like a dog.

53:22.367 --> 53:23.668
- I pay you well.

53:23.701 --> 53:26.371
I'll treat you
any way I want to.

53:26.371 --> 53:27.872
- All right then.

53:27.872 --> 53:29.574
You try takin' a fist to me

53:29.574 --> 53:33.210
and I will bite off something
you will sorely miss.

53:33.210 --> 53:37.882
- Yeah, well I guess you're
under protection of the house.

53:41.051 --> 53:43.654
(Bob chuckles)

53:46.391 --> 53:49.026
So, you fellas
don't know a place

53:49.059 --> 53:50.728
around here that's
hirin' do you?

53:54.732 --> 53:57.535
Yeah, the boss man where I'm at

53:57.568 --> 54:00.070
says I need to be lookin'
for somethin' else.

54:00.070 --> 54:02.573
He says I'm too hard
to get along with.

54:02.573 --> 54:04.709
- Imagine that.
- They might keep you around

54:04.709 --> 54:07.244
a little bit more if
you shut the hell up.

54:07.244 --> 54:08.879
- Unlikely.

54:08.913 --> 54:11.081
- Whose side are you on?

54:11.081 --> 54:12.383
- The winnin' side.

54:14.084 --> 54:17.254
- Well, it just so
happens these gentlemen

54:17.254 --> 54:19.056
been losin' to me
pretty regular today.

54:19.089 --> 54:20.625
They ain't cryin' about it.

54:20.625 --> 54:23.561
They must be doin' pretty
well, right fellas?

54:23.594 --> 54:24.729
- Wrong.

54:24.729 --> 54:25.796
- Shut up, Slade.

54:25.796 --> 54:26.897
- Look at this.

54:26.931 --> 54:28.866
I get no respect.

54:28.866 --> 54:30.368
- None deserved.

54:30.401 --> 54:32.437
(Bob chuckles)

54:32.437 --> 54:34.038
(Bridget chuckles)

54:34.071 --> 54:37.608
- So, y'all not workin'
in law enforcement,

54:37.608 --> 54:38.943
who are you workin' for?

54:39.977 --> 54:41.379
- Mostly odd jobs.

54:43.080 --> 54:44.882
- Opportunities
come here and there.

54:45.716 --> 54:48.753
- Well, I got ambitions.

54:48.786 --> 54:50.054
Y'all should let me know if any

54:50.054 --> 54:52.256
of these opportunities arise.

54:52.289 --> 54:53.624
- Well, no 'cause we'd have

54:53.624 --> 54:56.461
to listen to your
damn mouth all day.

54:56.461 --> 54:57.762
- That ain't gonna happen.

54:59.296 --> 55:00.331
- I'm out.

55:00.398 --> 55:03.067
(Bridget laughs)

55:04.469 --> 55:07.137
(pensive music)

55:26.323 --> 55:27.257
- Hey, Bob.

55:28.993 --> 55:29.827
- Frank?

55:33.330 --> 55:34.665
What you doin' here?

55:34.665 --> 55:36.166
I thought you--

55:36.166 --> 55:38.836
- I am but I'm not here
to cause you any trouble.

55:42.339 --> 55:43.774
- So I'm still asleep?

55:45.175 --> 55:46.043
- I wouldn't know.

55:47.277 --> 55:49.213
- So, if you ain't here
to cause any trouble,

55:50.781 --> 55:52.783
what you here for?

55:52.817 --> 55:55.820
- To knock some sense into your
ass like brothers should do.

55:57.488 --> 55:59.390
- What you mean?

55:59.390 --> 56:01.225
- That double bank job
you're plannin' tomorrow,

56:01.291 --> 56:03.661
I'm gonna need
y'all to step back.

56:04.729 --> 56:06.397
- You would say that.

56:06.397 --> 56:09.233
We're not in the same
line of work you were.

56:09.299 --> 56:11.736
- Whatever line
of work I was in,

56:11.736 --> 56:13.738
I just don't wanna
see my brothers hurt.

56:15.172 --> 56:18.709
- We done plenty of jobs,
this is just one more.

56:18.709 --> 56:21.412
- When you wake up you'll
remember you saw me,

56:21.479 --> 56:23.247
and you'll remember what I said.

56:26.417 --> 56:29.186
- Well, it's good to
see ya again, Frank.

56:29.219 --> 56:31.756
(gentle music)

56:42.166 --> 56:44.368
Hey, Skeeter, what
you doin' over here?

56:44.401 --> 56:46.537
- Papa, get I ride
with you tomorrow?

56:48.439 --> 56:53.210
- Well, Skeeter, we gotta
go outta town tomorrow.

56:53.243 --> 56:54.078
- I know.

56:54.078 --> 56:55.379
That's why I wanna go.

56:56.581 --> 56:59.083
- Look, you can do
with me sometime

56:59.083 --> 57:00.918
but tomorrow's not a good idea.

57:05.756 --> 57:08.292
Well, why do you
wanna go tomorrow?

57:08.358 --> 57:10.260
- 'Cause Mama's
worried about you.

57:11.462 --> 57:13.598
- Well, your mama's
always worried.

57:14.632 --> 57:15.633
- I worry too.

57:17.267 --> 57:18.102
- How come?

57:19.203 --> 57:20.370
- 'Cause Mama's worried.

57:21.972 --> 57:23.874
- Well, okay.

57:23.908 --> 57:25.710
I tell you what.

57:25.710 --> 57:26.544
- What?

57:27.745 --> 57:30.047
- Day after tomorrow, me
and you will saddle up.

57:30.948 --> 57:32.216
- Really?

57:32.249 --> 57:34.418
- Yeah, we'll go out
for a good long ride.

57:37.788 --> 57:38.823
- Okay, Papa.

57:40.991 --> 57:43.661
(pensive music)

57:47.397 --> 57:52.402
(hooves clomping)
(pensive music)

59:20.691 --> 59:21.692
- Good morning.

59:21.692 --> 59:23.160
Can I help you?

59:23.160 --> 59:26.831
- It might be a good idea for
me to talk to the manager.

59:26.831 --> 59:30.167
- I'm sorry, we don't open
for another 20 minutes

59:30.167 --> 59:33.938
and I don't expect
him until lunch time.

59:33.938 --> 59:36.440
- Okay then, you let
me into the vault.

59:38.609 --> 59:41.278
(Rebecca gasps)

59:43.080 --> 59:45.515
- Who are you, Mister?

59:45.515 --> 59:46.917
- I'm with the Dalton Gang.

59:46.917 --> 59:47.752
What's it to ya?

59:49.186 --> 59:51.455
- Well, I think you're
gonna get yourself killed

59:51.455 --> 59:53.557
this morning for no reason.

59:53.590 --> 59:55.092
- What?

59:55.092 --> 59:57.094
Just shut your trap
and open the vault.

59:58.062 --> 59:58.896
- I can't.

59:59.764 --> 1:00:01.431
- What you mean you can't?

1:00:02.399 --> 1:00:04.735
- It's on a time lock.

1:00:04.735 --> 1:00:08.238
The vault won't open
for another 15 minutes.

1:00:09.774 --> 1:00:11.408
- What now?

1:00:11.441 --> 1:00:13.077
- A time lock.

1:00:13.077 --> 1:00:15.479
They were installed last year.

1:00:17.381 --> 1:00:18.716
- Son of a bitch.

1:00:22.619 --> 1:00:23.788
You don't go anywhere.

1:00:25.790 --> 1:00:26.991
I'll be right back.

1:00:26.991 --> 1:00:29.660
(pensive music)

1:00:38.803 --> 1:00:39.970
- Okay.

1:00:41.005 --> 1:00:42.572
- Vault's on a time lock.

1:00:42.606 --> 1:00:43.908
- What do we do?

1:00:44.975 --> 1:00:46.176
- I don't know.

1:00:48.145 --> 1:00:49.680
- [Bob] The vault's
on a time lock.

1:00:49.747 --> 1:00:50.580

(gentle music)

1:01:02.159 --> 1:01:03.828
- Says it's on a time lock.

1:01:03.828 --> 1:01:04.829
- Same problem.

1:01:04.829 --> 1:01:06.330
- What do we do?

1:01:06.363 --> 1:01:08.132
- Let me go talk
to Bob real quick.

1:01:11.368 --> 1:01:13.470
- Same thing with that bank.

1:01:13.503 --> 1:01:14.538
- [Bob] Then we wait.

1:01:15.873 --> 1:01:16.673
- Figured that.

1:01:19.844 --> 1:01:21.946
Bob says we wait.

1:01:21.979 --> 1:01:23.213
(Grat sighs)

1:01:23.213 --> 1:01:24.048
- Okay.

1:01:28.385 --> 1:01:29.286
He says we wait.

1:01:30.287 --> 1:01:31.121
- Then we wait.

1:01:31.155 --> 1:01:33.724
(gentle music)

1:01:37.227 --> 1:01:38.896
- Hi, Lizzi.

1:01:38.896 --> 1:01:41.698
- Hey Marshal, that
there is Emmett Dalton.

1:01:41.698 --> 1:01:43.400
He just walked out of the bank.

1:01:46.036 --> 1:01:48.572
- Wonder what they're
doin' in town.

1:01:48.572 --> 1:01:52.076
- Marshal, I think
they're robbin' the bank.

1:01:52.142 --> 1:01:54.879
As a matter of fact I think
they're robbin' both banks.

1:01:56.480 --> 1:01:59.083
His brother just walked
out of the other bank.

1:01:59.083 --> 1:02:01.585
(gentle music)

1:02:06.023 --> 1:02:07.357
- Stay here.

1:02:07.391 --> 1:02:08.192
- Okay.

1:02:08.192 --> 1:02:10.761
(gentle music)

1:02:13.931 --> 1:02:15.933
- Ah, look who's back.

1:02:18.568 --> 1:02:20.670
- Decided to wait.

1:02:20.670 --> 1:02:22.406
- Well, you're the one with

1:02:22.406 --> 1:02:25.709
the weapon so
that's your choice.

1:02:25.742 --> 1:02:28.078
- That's right so you
keep that in mind.

1:02:31.715 --> 1:02:35.052
- Do you mind if I work a
little bit while we wait?

1:02:37.521 --> 1:02:38.522
- Feel free.

1:02:40.557 --> 1:02:44.795

1:03:07.251 --> 1:03:08.785
- [Marshal] We got a situation.

1:03:08.785 --> 1:03:12.622
Both banks in town's bein'
robbed at the same time.

1:03:12.656 --> 1:03:14.491
- You can't mean it.

1:03:14.558 --> 1:03:16.060
- I don't have much time.

1:03:16.093 --> 1:03:19.429
I need town folks to help
me fight these bandits off.

1:03:19.463 --> 1:03:21.131
- Do you know who they are?

1:03:22.466 --> 1:03:23.400
- [Marshal] The Dalton's.

1:03:25.169 --> 1:03:25.970
- Oh no.

1:03:27.737 --> 1:03:28.572
Are you sure?

1:03:29.639 --> 1:03:30.975
- [Marshal] I am.

1:03:32.342 --> 1:03:35.012
- But these are hometown boys.

1:03:35.012 --> 1:03:36.914
- That don't make no difference.

1:03:36.947 --> 1:03:38.648
I ain't got a lotta time.

1:03:38.648 --> 1:03:40.750
If you in the fight
come on with me.

1:03:47.024 --> 1:03:49.293
- So, are you joinin' in?

1:03:49.326 --> 1:03:50.160
- No.

1:03:54.198 --> 1:03:55.165
- How long now?

1:03:56.333 --> 1:03:59.336
- Do you mean how long
have you been here

1:03:59.336 --> 1:04:01.972
or until you can
get into the vault?

1:04:01.972 --> 1:04:05.642
- How long before
I get in the vault?

1:04:07.844 --> 1:04:09.113
- [Anne] 10 more minutes.

1:04:09.146 --> 1:04:11.481
(Bob sighs)

1:04:12.649 --> 1:04:15.452
- John, I need a favor.

1:04:15.452 --> 1:04:16.653
- Okay, what do you need?

1:04:18.355 --> 1:04:20.724
- The Dalton boys are
robbin' both banks.

1:04:21.625 --> 1:04:22.960
I need some help.

1:04:22.993 --> 1:04:23.827
You with us?

1:04:25.362 --> 1:04:26.863
- Sure.

1:04:26.863 --> 1:04:27.965
- All right.

1:04:27.998 --> 1:04:29.866
How much time do we have left?

1:04:31.401 --> 1:04:32.903
- Two minutes.

1:04:32.970 --> 1:04:35.172
Almost there.

1:04:35.205 --> 1:04:36.540
- Okay, then.

1:04:36.540 --> 1:04:39.343
What can I expect to
find in that vault?

1:04:39.343 --> 1:04:42.146
- Well, it's mostly silver.

1:04:42.146 --> 1:04:43.513
- Silver?

1:04:43.547 --> 1:04:45.182
- What about gold?

1:04:45.182 --> 1:04:47.684
What about cash money?

1:04:47.717 --> 1:04:49.853
- The silver is coin, Sir.

1:04:49.853 --> 1:04:52.589
It is cash money.

1:04:52.589 --> 1:04:53.924
- I got that.

1:04:53.991 --> 1:04:56.526
Now answer the damn question.

1:04:57.394 --> 1:05:00.197
- Some gold, not a lot.

1:05:00.230 --> 1:05:02.499
A good bit of cash.

1:05:03.567 --> 1:05:05.535
- Good and I'll be
takin' the silver, too.

1:05:08.238 --> 1:05:11.041
- Not without a wagon you won't.

1:05:11.041 --> 1:05:11.908
- What now?

1:05:13.377 --> 1:05:17.881
- I'm guessin' there's about
200 pounds of silver in there.

1:05:20.250 --> 1:05:21.418
- Is time up?

1:05:24.088 --> 1:05:25.122
- Yes it is.

1:05:26.023 --> 1:05:27.724
- Show me the gold and the cash.

1:05:30.394 --> 1:05:33.530
- It's not too late to
just walk away from this.

1:05:33.530 --> 1:05:36.800
- I'm gonna get what
I came here for.

1:05:36.800 --> 1:05:39.469
(pensive music)

1:06:14.804 --> 1:06:16.673
- Fellas, I see
things aren't goin'

1:06:16.740 --> 1:06:18.675
the way you woulda liked 'em to.

1:06:23.647 --> 1:06:25.349
Don't be stupid.

1:06:25.349 --> 1:06:28.018
(pensive music)

1:06:32.622 --> 1:06:37.627
(shots firing)
(pensive music)

1:08:30.607 --> 1:08:35.612
(hooves clomping)

1:08:51.728 --> 1:08:54.464
(birds chirping)

1:09:13.850 --> 1:09:16.453
(gentle music)

1:09:25.161 --> 1:09:27.364
- Well, Bridget, we break
the ground next week

1:09:27.431 --> 1:09:30.300

1:09:30.334 --> 1:09:32.135
- I'd still like
to call it a pub.

1:09:32.135 --> 1:09:33.637

1:09:33.670 --> 1:09:36.039
But you still wanna bring
over your girls don't ya?

They've been with me through

1:09:38.775 --> 1:09:41.144
the good times and
the hard times.

1:09:41.177 --> 1:09:42.346
(Curtis chuckles)

1:09:42.346 --> 1:09:43.713
- You know, the
newspapers have had

1:09:43.780 --> 1:09:46.049
a field day about
that crazy gun fight

1:09:46.049 --> 1:09:47.984
that went on down there.

1:09:48.017 --> 1:09:49.486
- It was a slaughter.

1:09:49.486 --> 1:09:51.655
I just out the poor
man out of his misery.

1:09:52.856 --> 1:09:55.792

to go through that.

1:09:55.825 --> 1:09:58.061
But I do wanna thank you.

1:09:58.061 --> 1:09:59.963
- Whatever for?

1:09:59.996 --> 1:10:03.166

on the Dalton Gang.

1:10:03.166 --> 1:10:05.702
(gentle music)

1:12:12.829 --> 1:12:15.365
