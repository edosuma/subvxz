WEBVTT

00:03.211 --> 00:05.588
(telephone rings)

00:13.346 --> 00:15.223
Hello. (sighs)

00:15.765 --> 00:16.766
Speaking.

00:19.769 --> 00:21.730
No, he didn't call me.

00:21.813 --> 00:23.189
It's the first I've heard.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.483
Are there charges against him?

00:27.777 --> 00:29.779
Yeah. Okay.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.489
7:15? Fine.

00:34.701 --> 00:36.453
Buntz shot a Heights detective.

00:37.370 --> 00:40.498
Item six: Lieutenant Buntz
is gonna be unavailable today

00:40.582 --> 00:42.292
on account of a shooting that took place

00:42.375 --> 00:44.711
last night in his underground garage.

00:44.794 --> 00:48.256
Detectives LaRue and Washington
are gonna be taking up his caseload.

00:48.339 --> 00:50.592
Also, Mick Belker's off.

00:50.675 --> 00:52.093
He's got a medical emergency.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.511
Robin's having the baby?

00:53.595 --> 00:56.556
No, no, Mick's just
going in for a tooth cap.

00:56.639 --> 01:01.352
Item seven: sentencing's today
for Mr. Robert Dunlaw,

01:01.436 --> 01:04.731
well-known and well-disliked slumlord

01:04.814 --> 01:07.358
at 226 Freemont Avenue.

01:07.817 --> 01:11.071
Attaboys to Officers Hill and Renko

01:11.154 --> 01:13.865
for their diligent work
with the tenants' organization

01:13.948 --> 01:16.951
in building up a case
against this sleazeball.

01:17.035 --> 01:20.538
(cheering)

01:20.622 --> 01:22.791
They're gonna be in court today.

01:22.874 --> 01:25.877
Item eight: fellas...

01:25.960 --> 01:28.880
we've been getting a lot of complaints

01:28.963 --> 01:30.965
from a Miss Kelly

01:31.049 --> 01:35.553
out of the Andrea Charmain Academy
of Dance and Aerobics.

01:35.637 --> 01:38.348
Now she's complaining that cops

01:38.431 --> 01:40.809
have been taking their lunch hour
to gawk at the ladies

01:40.892 --> 01:43.645
doing their exercises
through the plate-front window.

01:43.728 --> 01:47.065
Well, if Miss Kelly don't want
people looking at them ladies

01:47.148 --> 01:49.776
running around in their skimpies,
they shouldn't have put that window there.

01:49.859 --> 01:51.653
(hisses)

01:51.736 --> 01:53.613
Let's show some cooperation, huh?

01:53.696 --> 01:55.782
Let's keep our minds on business?

01:55.865 --> 01:57.784
Okay.

01:57.867 --> 02:02.247
Item nine: today, this precinct,

02:02.330 --> 02:05.834
and more specifically, yours truly,

02:05.917 --> 02:09.462
hosts the final meeting
of the desk sergeants'

02:09.546 --> 02:11.965
rule-book revision committee.

02:12.048 --> 02:15.301
Now we fine sergeants
have been burning the midnight oil

02:15.385 --> 02:17.762
for three months now, making assessments

02:17.846 --> 02:21.307
on how to update this musty, old elephant.

02:21.391 --> 02:24.018
-(chatter)
-Okay. All right.

02:24.102 --> 02:27.647
Assignments. While I'm otherwise occupied,

02:27.730 --> 02:30.191
Sergeant Bates here is gonna be manning
the front desk.

02:30.275 --> 02:31.943
Officer McBride will be riding

02:32.026 --> 02:34.654
with Officer Lipsky
on account of Galvin's out with the flu.

02:34.737 --> 02:37.407
Incidentally, that flu's
still going around, people.

02:37.490 --> 02:40.326
So listen, take care of yourselves, okay?

02:40.410 --> 02:42.662
All right, that's it. Let's get rolling.

02:42.745 --> 02:45.165
-(chatter)
-They're getting away out there.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.458
By the way, clean up
your breakfast things, will you?

02:47.542 --> 02:49.878
The sergeants are gonna
be meeting down here.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.047
Put a copy of the Donahue report
on your desk.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.008
-IAD call?
-Shipman's on his way,

02:55.091 --> 02:56.759
and Captain Ajanian's coming with him.

02:56.843 --> 02:58.511
It's a Heights investigation.

02:58.595 --> 03:03.975
Frank, I heard about this cop-shoots-cop
incident on the news.

03:04.058 --> 03:05.727
That's going to get ink, Frank.

03:05.810 --> 03:07.187
How we gonna handle it?

03:07.270 --> 03:08.855
How are we going to handle it?

03:09.772 --> 03:12.775
Graham, this incident relates
only to my job as precinct captain.

03:12.859 --> 03:14.277
It doesn't involve you in any way.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.946
Okay, Frank,
I'm certain you'll do what's best.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.241
Um, I stopped by
because I'm checking out locations

03:20.325 --> 03:22.285
for campaign headquarters.

03:22.368 --> 03:24.287
Any chance you can break away
and take a look?

03:24.370 --> 03:25.330
Well, today's out.

03:25.413 --> 03:27.916
I have an IAD investigation.
I'm supposed to meet the chief.

03:28.458 --> 03:29.667
I'll let you know what I find.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.463
It came via Kalimantan,

03:33.546 --> 03:36.382
Sarawak and then Singapore.

03:36.466 --> 03:39.052
Maybe we ought to check that out
with bomb squad, Lieutenant.

03:39.135 --> 03:40.887
Oh, no, this happens to be a gift

03:40.970 --> 03:43.514
from the Bupati of Bima Besar.

03:43.598 --> 03:46.392
I was only kidding. Happy birthday.

03:48.019 --> 03:49.062
It's not my birthday.

03:50.313 --> 03:53.566
Hey, Mel, where's the sergeants' meeting?

03:53.650 --> 03:55.235
They're down in roll call, sir.

03:55.318 --> 03:56.861
Thanks. I'll see you later.

03:57.654 --> 03:59.197
Wow!

03:59.280 --> 04:01.783
Hey! What you got there, Lieutenant?

04:01.866 --> 04:03.743
Some guy sent it to him from overseas.

04:04.535 --> 04:06.579
It must be some kind of flute,
huh, Lieutenant?

04:07.080 --> 04:11.542
Oh, well, something of this nature
is often employed in rites of passage.

04:12.210 --> 04:13.086
Give it a blow.

04:13.628 --> 04:16.422
Yes! Yes!

04:16.506 --> 04:19.175
Animist rituals have what they call...

04:19.259 --> 04:21.261
a spirit sound.

04:22.720 --> 04:23.972
(tinny sound)

04:24.055 --> 04:26.391
Uh, Lieutenant,
maybe you got to finger it.

04:26.474 --> 04:27.558
Here. Let me try.

04:29.227 --> 04:31.020
I used to play the sax.

04:33.398 --> 04:34.482
Ouch!

04:35.108 --> 04:37.277
Oh, it's a blowgun.

04:37.777 --> 04:39.112
(giggles)

04:40.405 --> 04:42.907
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:42.991 --> 04:45.076
<i>-Armed robbery in progress.</i>
-(sirens whooping)

04:45.159 --> 04:49.038
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner of People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:49.122 --> 04:50.581
(theme music playing)

06:30.765 --> 06:33.226
(indistinct radio chatter)

06:33.309 --> 06:38.898
(siren wails)

06:41.943 --> 06:44.028
(coughing)

06:55.456 --> 06:57.250
I'm a police officer.

06:57.792 --> 07:00.878
Put your hands out away from your body.

07:01.379 --> 07:02.713
I'll move them in a minute.

07:10.012 --> 07:10.847
Do I know you?

07:12.098 --> 07:12.932
Mick!

07:15.435 --> 07:18.104
Eddie! Eddie Gregg.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.982
Sure. You sent me to Florida.

07:21.441 --> 07:23.192
You got me to clean up my act.

07:23.276 --> 07:24.986
What the hell were you doing back there?

07:25.903 --> 07:27.029
Trying to get an advance.

07:27.613 --> 07:28.448
You work there?

07:29.699 --> 07:32.243
I'm gonna apply just
as soon as I feel better.

07:33.077 --> 07:35.455
(coughs)

07:37.582 --> 07:40.209
Oh! (panting)

07:43.421 --> 07:44.630
what's wrong with you?

07:45.882 --> 07:46.841
I'm sick.

07:48.426 --> 07:49.552
I've got it.

07:51.637 --> 07:53.055
Oh, God.

07:54.724 --> 07:56.476
You got that? AIDS?

07:57.685 --> 07:58.811
Yeah.

08:03.274 --> 08:05.109
-Come on.
-Am I arrested?

08:05.193 --> 08:06.360
I'm not arresting you.

08:06.444 --> 08:08.905
-I'm taking you over to County Hospital.
-Forget it, Mick.

08:08.988 --> 08:11.491
I've already made the hospital.
They can't help me anymore.

08:11.574 --> 08:12.700
You got to go someplace.

08:14.327 --> 08:16.245
Could you take me to my room?

08:20.708 --> 08:22.543
Yeah. Come on.

08:25.463 --> 08:26.839
Didn't get much sleep, huh?

08:27.465 --> 08:30.384
No, I was at the hospital till Tommy died.

08:30.468 --> 08:32.595
-I got home around 5:30.
-MAN: Guido?

08:33.930 --> 08:34.972
Hi, Captain.

08:35.598 --> 08:37.808
You know Lieutenant Shipman from IAD.

08:37.892 --> 08:39.977
-Yeah, sure.
-We got room A.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.605
-You want to get some notes?
-No, I'm ready.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.690
Go ahead.
I'm gonna have a word with Furillo.

08:44.774 --> 08:45.816
Thank you, sir.

08:47.235 --> 08:48.778
-Frank.
-Bob.

08:49.278 --> 08:51.948
-I heard you were sitting in.
-I've got a few questions of my own.

08:52.031 --> 08:53.282
What's the word from SID?

08:54.075 --> 08:57.745
You know, the gun that Buntz claims
was Donahue's is untraceable.

08:57.828 --> 09:00.206
There are some latent prints,
but mostly inconclusive.

09:00.289 --> 09:02.708
-What about witnesses?
-People say they heard shouts,

09:02.792 --> 09:05.670
but nobody went into the garage
till after it happened.

09:05.753 --> 09:08.214
Now, Buntz stayed with Donahue
until he went into a coma,

09:08.297 --> 09:09.757
but he never got a statement.

09:09.840 --> 09:12.385
I find self-defense is a hard buy.

09:14.428 --> 09:18.182
Yeah, but, Joe, we already got
salmons, magentas, pinks, and blues.

09:18.266 --> 09:21.936
And I say that chartreuse
is your crucial fifth color!

09:22.645 --> 09:28.234
Distinguishes between animal code
violations and public nuisances.

09:28.317 --> 09:30.236
What are you guys doing?
Starting without me?

09:32.154 --> 09:33.948
No, no, we just thought you'd skip,

09:34.031 --> 09:35.241
like the last two times.

09:35.324 --> 09:37.034
Oh, come on, Sarge.

09:37.118 --> 09:38.369
Give me a break, will you?

09:38.452 --> 09:40.580
-I got me a bad back.
-(laughs)

09:40.663 --> 09:42.999
Probably all that exercise
you get, huh, Lou?

09:43.624 --> 09:47.003
Heard the man's a wrestler.
Always pounding the mats.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.129
(laughing)

09:48.212 --> 09:50.298
(laughs) Hey, listen, you guys.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.675
Sex after 60 is twice as nice.

09:52.758 --> 09:53.759
(laughs)

09:53.843 --> 09:54.927
You want to sit down?

09:55.595 --> 09:57.555
Got a lot of ground to cover here.

09:57.638 --> 09:59.307
And frankly, I'm not interested in you

10:00.141 --> 10:02.101
and your latest conquest.

10:02.184 --> 10:04.437
And Detective Donahue
had his hands behind his head?

10:04.520 --> 10:05.980
That's right.

10:06.063 --> 10:09.233
Then when I came out,
he lowered them, like this.

10:11.277 --> 10:13.654
I could see he had a little .25 automatic

10:13.738 --> 10:16.490
hidden between his palms aimed at me,

10:16.574 --> 10:19.327
-and I shot him.
-Why do you feel your former partner

10:19.410 --> 10:21.203
-would want to kill you?
-Vince Delaberto

10:21.287 --> 10:22.955
was killed the night before.

10:23.998 --> 10:25.833
I knew Tommy killed him.

10:25.916 --> 10:28.336
Did Donahue ever admit to you
that he killed Delaberto?

10:28.419 --> 10:30.087
No, but I was looking around.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.381
I'd have turned something
up and Tommy knew that.

10:32.465 --> 10:34.759
Why were you trying to turn something up?

10:34.842 --> 10:37.053
We talked yesterday. I was on the case.

10:37.136 --> 10:39.930
There was no departmental reason
for you to be involved.

10:40.014 --> 10:42.224
You know I was personally
involved with Tommy.

10:42.308 --> 10:44.852
-Weren't you working with him, Guido?
-Working with him?

10:47.647 --> 10:48.898
What's that supposed to mean?

10:49.482 --> 10:50.983
Hold it a second.

10:57.490 --> 10:59.533
Mr. Fratello, you know this man?

10:59.617 --> 11:01.869
Yeah, he shook me down with Tommy Donahue.

11:01.952 --> 11:04.205
-Hey, now look!
-Lieutenant Buntz, be quiet.

11:05.581 --> 11:07.333
When was the last time
you saw this man, Mr. Fratello?

11:07.416 --> 11:08.959
Couple of months back.

11:09.794 --> 11:11.837
Donahue came and shook me down,

11:11.921 --> 11:13.381
and this guy was with him.

11:13.464 --> 11:16.008
Put me in the backseat of the car,
couple cracks to the ribs.

11:17.093 --> 11:18.302
And he stood outside.

11:19.261 --> 11:20.721
Kept lookout.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.557
Come on.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.185
(door closes)

11:27.103 --> 11:29.355
All right, now first of all,
I never saw any shakedown,

11:29.438 --> 11:31.440
and second, what's that shylock
got to do with anything?

11:31.524 --> 11:33.734
-I see linkage here.
-What linkage?

11:33.818 --> 11:36.153
-You and Tommy were pulling shakedowns!
-Not a chance!

11:36.237 --> 11:38.447
Donahue owed that guy money
and that's all.

11:38.531 --> 11:40.408
I told you yesterday,
Tommy was in sewerage.

11:40.491 --> 11:41.742
I'll run it for you.

11:41.826 --> 11:45.246
You were shaking people,
and Vince Delaberto was on to you. A.

11:45.329 --> 11:48.374
B: you had to do something
before Delaberto made a case,

11:48.457 --> 11:51.335
so either you whacked him yourself,
or you scared Donahue bad enough

11:51.419 --> 11:52.378
so he'd go whack him.

11:52.461 --> 11:54.839
Then, C: you couldn't be sure
Donahue was gonna stand up,

11:54.922 --> 11:57.216
so you whacked him, too.
Now tell me it doesn't lay out.

12:10.104 --> 12:10.938
Yo!

12:14.275 --> 12:15.317
Thanks.

12:19.280 --> 12:20.364
The decor isn't much.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.368
But you can see the river.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.494
That's nice.

12:33.669 --> 12:34.837
Eddie.

12:37.047 --> 12:39.508
-You know that I broke my tooth?
-Ouch.

12:39.592 --> 12:42.636
Yeah. I was on my way to the dentist
when I saw you, and I think--

12:42.720 --> 12:44.930
Always take care of your teeth.

12:49.518 --> 12:50.478
Yeah.

12:59.153 --> 13:00.070
Good luck, Eddie.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.867
Mick, how late are you?

13:06.577 --> 13:07.745
Wow, I'm late.

13:08.287 --> 13:09.914
I'm supposed to be there now.

13:13.459 --> 13:14.293
What?

13:17.546 --> 13:18.756
I want some ice cream.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.301
I should call you a doctor.
That's what I should do.

13:22.384 --> 13:24.887
No. No doctors.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.849
You want ice cream?

13:30.893 --> 13:31.977
Okay.

13:33.395 --> 13:34.355
Sure.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.567
Um, what flavor?

13:38.651 --> 13:40.611
Chocolate. Love it.

13:40.694 --> 13:42.863
Chocolate. Right.

13:45.908 --> 13:46.784
Mick?

13:48.869 --> 13:50.579
I'm sorry I'm making you late.

13:51.038 --> 13:52.122
It's all right.

13:52.206 --> 13:54.041
(melancholic music playing)

14:01.173 --> 14:04.635
Mr. Dunlaw, you have anything to say
before I impose sentence?

14:04.718 --> 14:05.845
Yeah.

14:06.929 --> 14:07.930
I'm not a crook.

14:08.013 --> 14:10.057
-(spectators murmur)
-I'm a property owner.

14:11.559 --> 14:12.476
JUDGE: Quiet.

14:12.560 --> 14:14.353
(bangs gavel) Enough!

14:15.563 --> 14:16.480
Mr. Dunlaw?

14:17.022 --> 14:19.650
When this court thinks of you,
it thinks of rats,

14:19.733 --> 14:23.779
falling plaster, inoperative boilers,
and backed-up toilets.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.323
In our plea bargain,
I promised I wouldn't jail you.

14:27.283 --> 14:29.243
A jail term wouldn't help
your tenants anyway.

14:29.326 --> 14:31.078
That's absolutely correct, Your Honor.

14:32.872 --> 14:34.623
I sentence you, therefore, to probation,

14:34.707 --> 14:36.458
with the following condition:

14:36.542 --> 14:38.752
you will be escorted from this courtroom

14:38.836 --> 14:42.131
by arresting officers Hill and Renko

14:42.798 --> 14:45.676
and are hereby ordered confined

14:45.759 --> 14:47.052
to the janitor's apartment

14:47.136 --> 14:50.598
-at 226 Freemont Avenue...
-(cheering, laughing)

14:50.681 --> 14:54.810
...until such time as you bring
that building up to code.

14:55.436 --> 14:58.188
Hold the phone, Your Honor,
this would be worse than jail.

14:58.272 --> 15:00.566
That's a sorry admission, Mr. Mangella.

15:00.649 --> 15:02.943
What, are you starting
your campaign, Judge?

15:03.027 --> 15:05.446
(bangs gavel) Silence or contempt.

15:06.447 --> 15:08.073
Next! (bangs gavel)

15:08.157 --> 15:10.826
Yeah, I was wrong, and I was out of policy
going out with Donahue,

15:10.910 --> 15:13.579
but that doesn't mean
I deliberately killed anybody.

15:13.662 --> 15:17.499
If I wanted Tommy dead, I sure
wouldn't have taken him to no hospital.

15:17.583 --> 15:19.585
Ajanian came over here to get me.

15:19.668 --> 15:22.046
Nothing I can do about it.
It's in his jurisdiction.

15:22.129 --> 15:23.797
Am I supposed to do, just sit on my hands?

15:23.881 --> 15:26.383
No, you'll sit
at your desk till further notice.

15:26.467 --> 15:27.843
But I know the history on this.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.137
Look, if you have any leads on evidence,

15:30.220 --> 15:32.181
I suggest
you turn them over to the Heights.

15:32.264 --> 15:34.099
Oh, yeah. I do that, and I'm done.

15:34.808 --> 15:37.728
Norm, what reason could Ajanian have

15:37.811 --> 15:39.480
for wanting to hang this on you?

15:39.563 --> 15:42.608
When I left, it's not like we parted
on the best of terms.

15:42.691 --> 15:45.152
It doesn't begin to justify
what you're suggesting.

15:45.235 --> 15:46.862
Maybe since Donahue made him look bad,

15:46.946 --> 15:49.031
he figures getting me
is gonna make him look good.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.241
I don't know what his reason is,
but he's got one.

15:55.746 --> 15:57.665
-Hello, Frank.
-Graham.

15:58.624 --> 16:01.418
I found an empty storefront
on March and 28th Avenue.

16:01.502 --> 16:04.755
Ideal location for our headquarters.
So I gave them a deposit.

16:04.838 --> 16:07.466
-Isn't that a little premature?
-We want to get the best place

16:07.549 --> 16:09.718
and hire the best people
before somebody else does.

16:09.802 --> 16:12.179
(clears throat)
Maybe we can have dinner tomorrow.

16:13.263 --> 16:18.268
Can I tell the boys in the back room
that tomorrow is definitely the day?

16:21.897 --> 16:24.692
Tomorrow will be the day.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.779
I'm taking that smile
to mean something positive.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.239
No comment till dinner.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.491
I won't press.

16:32.574 --> 16:34.952
By the way, um, earlier,

16:35.035 --> 16:37.830
the reason my antenna went up
over that shooting incident

16:37.913 --> 16:42.251
is that, uh, that could be opportune
for certain people right now.

16:42.334 --> 16:43.168
I don't follow.

16:43.252 --> 16:45.754
Our venerable mayor,
being a one-time police lieutenant

16:45.838 --> 16:48.882
and longtime friend
of Heights Captain Ajanian.

16:48.966 --> 16:52.219
Are you suggesting that Captain Ajanian
is Ozzie's man?

16:52.302 --> 16:54.596
I'm just considering possibilities.

16:54.680 --> 16:57.933
Trouble for you at this time
might revitalize Ozzie as a candidate.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.019
It's just a theory.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.315
(telephone ringing)

17:06.400 --> 17:08.819
Anybody wants to know,
I'm out eating a hoagie.

17:10.320 --> 17:13.907
On pages 414-416, subsection G,

17:13.991 --> 17:15.993
the Randall-Salassey morbidity test,

17:16.076 --> 17:17.786
that remains as is.

17:17.870 --> 17:20.414
Have you, uh, ever asked yourself

17:20.497 --> 17:23.333
just what is a morbidity test?

17:23.417 --> 17:25.711
If it don't cook,
it don't belong in a book.

17:25.794 --> 17:29.006
All right, now just tell me
what this looks like.

17:29.089 --> 17:30.799
Then I can look it up in appendix B

17:30.883 --> 17:33.969
and I can tell you just how depressed
or whatever you are.

17:34.053 --> 17:36.513
-Now what do you see?
-Let me think here a minute.

17:36.597 --> 17:40.184
Uh, I guess I see, uh...

17:40.267 --> 17:43.270
a nice pair of ripe melons.

17:43.353 --> 17:44.563
(snickers)

17:45.022 --> 17:47.357
No, no, wait, wait! I got it.

17:47.441 --> 17:48.609
Ah! Got it.

17:48.692 --> 17:51.737
A great, big pair of tickets.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.572
(laughing)

17:56.325 --> 17:58.660
You know, you can never
take things serious, Lou.

17:58.744 --> 18:00.537
To you, everything is a big joke!

18:03.040 --> 18:05.292
Well, come on, back off a little bit.

18:05.375 --> 18:06.752
Just trying to have a little fun.

18:07.711 --> 18:11.173
Hey, Jabo, the wife's high-fiber
breakfast is working.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.050
What do you say we take a little break?

18:14.468 --> 18:17.596
Yeah, okay. Be back in 20 minutes.

18:18.263 --> 18:22.101
You see? Look, you see how it is down here
with the kids with the golf clubs?

18:22.184 --> 18:24.269
Believe me,
they are not headed for the back nine.

18:24.812 --> 18:28.232
No offense, Officer Hill, but this is
a dangerous neighborhood for white people.

18:28.315 --> 18:29.942
Mr. Dunlaw, you were sentenced.

18:30.025 --> 18:32.903
Now it's our duty to take you
to 226 Freemont Avenue

18:32.986 --> 18:34.404
-to serve that sentence.
-I know,

18:34.488 --> 18:36.156
but at least you'll stay with me, right?

18:36.240 --> 18:38.033
Till I get some locks on the door
and get my phone in?

18:38.117 --> 18:41.120
Believe it or not,
we do have other duties to attend to.

18:41.203 --> 18:43.163
We're not your private police force.

18:43.247 --> 18:44.832
I got to hire my own cops now?

18:44.915 --> 18:47.459
Before you spend money on security forces,

18:47.543 --> 18:50.629
might I suggest you spend
some money on the building.

18:50.712 --> 18:54.383
If Judge Wachtel wasn't planning
on running for public office,

18:54.466 --> 18:56.218
none of this goes down like this.

18:56.301 --> 19:00.264
(crowd clamors)

19:00.347 --> 19:03.100
-There he is.
-(honks horn)

19:03.183 --> 19:05.269
Mr. Dunlaw!

19:05.352 --> 19:09.106
You and I are gonna go over this list,
every single item.

19:09.189 --> 19:11.233
-We got him here now!
-Yeah!

19:11.316 --> 19:14.278
You're gonna be doing
some serious fixing here!

19:14.361 --> 19:16.405
(indistinct warning)

19:16.488 --> 19:18.198
Get the man out of the car.
Just step back.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.617
(crowd clamors)

19:20.701 --> 19:22.452
Get out of the vehicle, please.

19:22.536 --> 19:25.622
-No!
-Come on out of there, Dunlaw!

19:26.790 --> 19:28.584
Come on out of there, Dunlaw!

19:28.667 --> 19:31.295
(racket)

19:31.378 --> 19:32.796
Yeah! Yeah!

19:37.676 --> 19:39.553
(yelling)

19:39.636 --> 19:41.847
We gonna see how you like it, Dunlaw!

19:42.931 --> 19:44.474
Yeah! We gonna see how you like it!

19:44.558 --> 19:47.728
You know what? You'll get
your butt thrown in jail, brother!

19:47.811 --> 19:49.521
You got it? Now move back.

19:49.605 --> 19:53.317
(racket)

19:53.400 --> 19:56.195
(church bells ring in the distance)

19:58.071 --> 19:59.865
(coughing)

20:02.659 --> 20:03.660
Mary.

20:03.744 --> 20:05.954
-Oh, no, Guido, not you.
Come on, Mary, we got to talk.

20:06.038 --> 20:07.956
-No. Let go. I'm going to mass.
-We got to talk.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.959
-He thought you were gonna help him!
-Don't you know I tried?

20:11.043 --> 20:12.169
Don't you know I wanted to?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.047
Look, he came after me with a gun.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.383
-He was gonna kill me.
-No!

20:18.467 --> 20:20.719
Look, Mary, there's things I got to know.

20:21.511 --> 20:23.639
Tommy was like a pack rat.
He stashed stuff.

20:23.722 --> 20:25.015
Come on, listen to me.

20:25.098 --> 20:27.476
I'm going to mass. You'll burn in hell!

20:28.185 --> 20:30.270
Look at me
and I'll tell you how I really feel.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.396
No!

20:32.022 --> 20:34.233
You killed him, you rat bastard!

20:36.485 --> 20:40.072
-(tires screech)
-(horns honk)

20:51.917 --> 20:54.378
It's not the house,
of course, but it's not bad.

20:55.170 --> 20:56.338
And it's all rented.

20:56.880 --> 21:00.509
My new philosophy is why own anything
if they just take it away from you?

21:00.592 --> 21:02.511
Cora, of course,
is being totally unreasonable.

21:02.594 --> 21:04.930
Won't even part
with a few towels or flatware.

21:05.889 --> 21:08.725
Anyways, sit on my new rented couch.

21:10.727 --> 21:13.105
So you're giving them
the word tomorrow over dinner.

21:13.188 --> 21:14.314
You know everything.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.233
The fact that I know
shouldn't be a problem.

21:17.526 --> 21:19.778
But one of the first things
I would do if I were mayor

21:19.861 --> 21:21.989
is plug up all those leaks.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.366
And I happen to know
where they are, Frank.

21:24.449 --> 21:27.160
When you're the new kid
on the block in City Hall,

21:27.244 --> 21:29.621
it won't hurt to have somebody
watching your backside.

21:29.705 --> 21:32.499
-Chief, first of all--
-(door creaking open)

21:35.252 --> 21:37.421
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-No, no, not at all. Come in.

21:37.504 --> 21:38.880
We're all friends.

21:39.589 --> 21:42.092
-Hello, Patsy. How have you been?
-Fine.

21:43.051 --> 21:46.179
Congratulations. Fletcher tells me
that tomorrow you make it official.

21:47.806 --> 21:49.766
Chief is sometimes ahead of me.

21:51.935 --> 21:53.312
Well, do you like the place?

21:53.395 --> 21:55.397
I was gonna take
all the credit for the decor,

21:55.480 --> 21:57.274
but in fact Patsy picked everything.

21:57.357 --> 21:58.608
(telephone rings)

21:58.692 --> 22:00.193
Uh, I really should get back, Chief.

22:00.277 --> 22:02.946
No. Stay for a minute.
We have to talk about the PBA thing.

22:03.030 --> 22:06.116
(telephone ringing)

22:06.199 --> 22:08.577
-You seem very surprised.
-Well, I am.

22:09.619 --> 22:12.914
Uh, wasn't too long ago
when it seems to me

22:12.998 --> 22:15.083
you had a very different feeling
about the chief.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.003
Oh, I couldn't stand him
and he kept pursuing me.

22:18.086 --> 22:20.130
But then I finally began to realize

22:20.213 --> 22:21.840
that it wasn't him I couldn't stand.

22:22.591 --> 22:24.092
The things that I didn't like

22:25.052 --> 22:26.928
were a reflection of his unhappiness.

22:27.971 --> 22:29.264
You see that, don't you?

22:31.058 --> 22:33.143
-He does seem more relaxed.
-He is.

22:33.894 --> 22:37.105
Frank, that was Bob Ajanian
from the Heights.

22:37.189 --> 22:40.817
He's got a witness, apparently Donahue's
girlfriend who says your Lieutenant Buntz

22:40.901 --> 22:42.569
-assaulted her on the street.
-What?

22:42.652 --> 22:45.072
-Didn't you restrict the man to his desk?
-Of course I did.

22:45.155 --> 22:47.532
He's in the street, Frank.
Better get him under control.

22:49.368 --> 22:52.537
In, uh, in regard to the Heights,

22:52.621 --> 22:55.123
bear in mind
Ajanian has his own fish to fry.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.416
Meaning what?

22:56.500 --> 22:58.168
Donahue is making him look bad.

22:59.211 --> 23:02.381
It's to his advantage
to have Buntz make you look worse.

23:04.383 --> 23:06.927
(telephone ringing)

23:07.010 --> 23:09.721
Sergeant, do you have
any word from the lab

23:09.805 --> 23:11.348
of what was on that dart tip?

23:11.431 --> 23:13.683
Nothing yet, Lieutenant. How do you feel?

23:13.767 --> 23:16.520
Well, it's kind
of a strange, curious fact,

23:16.603 --> 23:20.482
but I'm experiencing
a sort of weird exhilaration.

23:20.565 --> 23:21.650
Oh.

23:21.733 --> 23:24.653
You have any idea when they're gonna
finish with that banging?

23:25.112 --> 23:26.154
What banging is that?

23:26.238 --> 23:28.740
That drumming sound--
that ba-boom, ba-boom,

23:28.824 --> 23:30.367
ba-boom.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.786
Let me see if I can go
goose them on that report.

23:32.869 --> 23:39.042
-Mm-hmm. Ba-boom, boom...
-(telephone ringing)

23:43.630 --> 23:45.924
-Seen the captain?
-He isn't back yet.

23:48.343 --> 23:49.386
(clears throat)

23:53.682 --> 23:55.642
NEAL: Never seen
the lieutenant that nervous.

23:55.725 --> 23:59.271
J.D.: Hey, I've been there.
It ain't no walk in the spring rain.

24:00.021 --> 24:01.606
You call that pins and needles?

24:02.149 --> 24:05.610
I think you call that
lucky he got back before Furillo did.

24:05.694 --> 24:08.905
NEAL: I heard the captain and the IAD
tell him to keep to his desk.

24:08.989 --> 24:11.074
Is he as much of an outlaw as his rep?

24:11.158 --> 24:12.576
He gets the job done.

24:12.659 --> 24:15.370
Question is if he'll be getting it done
in Furillo's precinct.

24:15.454 --> 24:17.539
Lucy, we have an interrogation room free?

24:17.622 --> 24:18.832
They're both free.

24:19.416 --> 24:21.334
-Norm.
-We got to talk, Captain.

24:21.418 --> 24:24.045
-Come on.
-(siren wails)

24:24.129 --> 24:25.338
Shut the door.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.843
-Look, Captain--
-Shut up. Where the hell have you been?

24:29.926 --> 24:32.596
-I took an hour personal time.
-You're restricted to your desk.

24:32.679 --> 24:34.014
You don't have personal time.

24:34.097 --> 24:36.391
I left my badge and my gun.
I didn't go out as a cop.

24:36.475 --> 24:38.310
Now what in the hell happened, Norm?

24:38.393 --> 24:40.479
Donahue's girlfriend
claims you assaulted her.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.522
That dumb slat. I didn't assault her.

24:42.606 --> 24:44.733
I stopped her on the street.
I wanted to talk to her.

24:44.816 --> 24:46.359
But she didn't want to talk to you.

24:46.443 --> 24:49.863
Not a chance. Captain,
I had an idea about something.

24:49.946 --> 24:51.448
Delaberto kept a book.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.492
IAD found a snitch book.
There was nothing in it.

24:53.575 --> 24:56.077
No, not a snitch book.
The guy kept a journal.

24:56.161 --> 24:57.412
He wrote everything down.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.831
I figure that's what Tommy
wanted when he whacked him.

24:59.915 --> 25:02.042
-Wouldn't he have destroyed it?
-I don't think so.

25:02.125 --> 25:03.418
If Tommy had it, he'd keep it.

25:03.502 --> 25:05.921
He'd figure maybe there'd be
some way he could use it.

25:06.004 --> 25:09.257
It's a long shot, but maybe Mary's got it
or she knows where it is.

25:10.800 --> 25:12.052
(sighs)

25:12.135 --> 25:14.262
Look, uh, whatever you think of me--

25:14.346 --> 25:16.473
We're different sorts of cops, Norman.

25:16.556 --> 25:19.643
Maybe, but we both got a sense
of what's right, and this ain't.

25:19.726 --> 25:22.145
-Where does she live?
-Kemper and 148th.

25:22.229 --> 25:23.647
-That's the Hill.
-Yeah.

25:24.648 --> 25:27.192
Hmph! No, thank you very much.

25:29.069 --> 25:31.029
Henry, amazing. That was toxicology.

25:31.112 --> 25:32.155
What's the verdict?

25:32.239 --> 25:34.199
The poison on the dart was not curare.

25:34.282 --> 25:36.993
The toxicology says it's altogether new.

25:37.077 --> 25:40.789
He thinks that it may come
from the skin of a tree frog.

25:40.872 --> 25:42.374
-You're kidding!
-No.

25:42.457 --> 25:46.044
It's not fair to call an object
like this primitive.

25:46.127 --> 25:49.756
It clearly represents
a very complex technology.

25:49.839 --> 25:52.008
-What do you think this is for?
-(coughs)

25:52.092 --> 25:53.969
Some sort of bagpipe effect?

25:54.052 --> 25:58.098
You know, that's a
very interesting conjecture, Lieutenant.

25:58.181 --> 25:59.891
Ooh! (coughs)

25:59.975 --> 26:02.310
-Oh!
-Oh, my God!

26:05.063 --> 26:06.273
I'm going aloft.

26:09.943 --> 26:11.403
I'm flying.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.073
Now this is the facial hair amendment.

26:15.574 --> 26:17.909
Amended so in the event
an officer's mustache

26:17.993 --> 26:20.579
and/or sideburns are of excessive length

26:20.662 --> 26:22.247
or curled in any manner,

26:22.330 --> 26:25.333
the desk sergeant
will keep in supply scissors

26:25.417 --> 26:27.085
for the correction of said problem.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.004
What are we now, a barbershop?

26:29.087 --> 26:32.299
Oh, may sound corny,
but Joe's got a point.

26:32.382 --> 26:33.800
Scissors are cheap.

26:33.883 --> 26:36.553
We're representatives of law enforcement,

26:36.636 --> 26:38.847
and we ought to look clean and sharp.

26:38.930 --> 26:41.766
Ho ho ho! "Clean and sharp."

26:41.850 --> 26:44.352
Sheesh! Tell me something.

26:44.436 --> 26:48.690
Just when did you ever
look clean and sharp?

26:48.773 --> 26:51.735
Now that's uncalled for, Lou.
We're not talking about individuals.

26:51.818 --> 26:54.571
I'll tell you what we're talking about.

26:54.654 --> 26:56.531
We're talking about the fact
you want to keep

26:56.615 --> 26:59.576
every little, petty procedure in this book

26:59.659 --> 27:01.578
and then throw in a few more of your own.

27:01.661 --> 27:03.413
Cut it, Lue, let's stick to the issue--

27:03.496 --> 27:05.874
The issue is this. You know what?

27:05.957 --> 27:08.668
I think you're in love
with this old hunk of junk.

27:08.752 --> 27:11.463
I wouldn't be a bit surprised
if you didn't take it to bed.

27:11.546 --> 27:13.673
That's it. That's it!

27:13.757 --> 27:16.468
Come on! Come on, Martino! Try me!

27:18.887 --> 27:22.307
My God, Stan. Amazing!

27:22.390 --> 27:24.559
Yeah, he had it coming for a long time.

27:24.643 --> 27:26.061
(panting)

27:26.144 --> 27:28.563
(telephone ringing)

27:29.230 --> 27:30.690
J.D., Neal.

27:31.691 --> 27:32.859
I want you to pull a warrant

27:32.942 --> 27:35.987
and toss an apartment
rented by a Mary Franken.

27:36.071 --> 27:38.573
I thought we were taking a backseat
on that investigation.

27:38.657 --> 27:41.076
It's the Hill. It's within jurisdiction.

27:41.159 --> 27:43.328
Just inform the Heights
on anything we find.

27:43.411 --> 27:45.705
-But we don't inform them before we go?
-No.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.961
-LaRue, Wash.
-Hey, Hill.

27:52.921 --> 27:54.673
Officers, there's a woman here to see you.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.341
-What's going on--
-I called the judge up,

27:56.424 --> 27:58.510
-and he said to call you people.
-Who? For what?

27:58.593 --> 28:00.053
-He's gone.
-Dunlaw's gone?

28:00.136 --> 28:02.138
One of the boys brought him
a dead rat to show him.

28:02.222 --> 28:03.139
Then he starts yelling.

28:03.223 --> 28:05.183
He don't care what no judge said,
he's out of there.

28:05.266 --> 28:07.435
-Maybe we ought to go out to Farmingdale.
-You got the address.

28:07.519 --> 28:10.146
-Yeah, got it someplace.
-441 Towanee.

28:10.230 --> 28:11.940
-All right.
-Thank you.

28:13.775 --> 28:16.236
(telephone ringing)

28:17.987 --> 28:20.323
-You sure you're all right?
-Yes.

28:20.782 --> 28:22.033
This goes to narcotics.

28:22.117 --> 28:23.618
It's got to be hallucinogen.

28:23.702 --> 28:25.245
What I saw was real.

28:25.787 --> 28:27.372
What I saw was truth.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.962
(indistinct radio chatter)

28:38.258 --> 28:40.093
Well, they sure know how to live.

28:40.176 --> 28:41.261
Yeah.

28:49.853 --> 28:50.895
(knocks)

28:55.734 --> 28:58.069
Excuse me, ma'am.
Is this the Dunlaw residence?

28:58.153 --> 28:59.154
Yes, it is.

28:59.237 --> 29:01.322
Is Mr. Dunlaw at home?
I'd like to talk to him.

29:01.906 --> 29:02.991
No, he isn't.

29:04.951 --> 29:05.785
Mr. Dunlaw?

29:07.704 --> 29:09.038
Mr. Dunlaw! Bobby!

29:09.122 --> 29:10.957
(action music playing)

29:15.837 --> 29:17.589
ANDY: Hold it, pal! Hold it right there!

29:18.339 --> 29:20.008
The gate! Through the gate!

29:32.896 --> 29:34.314
(dogs barking)

29:42.155 --> 29:45.158
Okay, pal, you're going back
to your own neighborhood.

29:46.785 --> 29:49.537
(TV playing)

29:49.621 --> 29:50.747
(knocking)

29:51.206 --> 29:52.957
-MARY: Yes?
-Mary Franken?

29:56.711 --> 29:57.879
Police officers.

29:57.962 --> 30:00.465
I'm detective Washington.
This is detective LaRue.

30:00.548 --> 30:01.966
-From the Heights?
-Hill Street.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.010
I only want to talk
to people from the Heights.

30:04.093 --> 30:06.262
Tommy was from the Heights
and they care about him.

30:06.346 --> 30:08.598
Mary, you better let us in.

30:08.681 --> 30:10.475
We got a search warrant.

30:14.854 --> 30:16.606
Are you friends of Guido?

30:17.148 --> 30:18.983
-Who?
-She means Buntz.

30:19.067 --> 30:21.820
We're here to investigate
the death of Detective Donahue.

30:21.903 --> 30:24.155
I don't have to talk
and I don't have to cooperate.

30:24.239 --> 30:28.034
-Hey, Tommy spend much time here?
-No.

30:28.117 --> 30:30.787
We got a feeling
he left some things with you.

30:30.870 --> 30:33.289
-Nothing.
-There's two ways we can do this, Mary.

30:33.373 --> 30:35.124
One, you tell us where they are.

30:35.208 --> 30:37.961
Two, we toss this place into the street

30:38.044 --> 30:39.754
and pick through things in the sidewalk.

30:39.838 --> 30:41.923
You got a warrant. Do your job.

30:42.006 --> 30:43.591
You aren't getting any help out of me.

30:53.643 --> 30:57.814
(indistinct chatter over radio)

31:06.531 --> 31:09.242
Now, sir, I hope you don't expect
any further escort.

31:09.325 --> 31:10.451
No, I'm going.

31:10.535 --> 31:11.828
But I'll tell you something,

31:12.412 --> 31:14.372
nobody's gonna mess with Bob Dunlaw.

31:21.838 --> 31:23.756
Oh, that's so good.

31:26.634 --> 31:28.970
(shivers)

31:29.053 --> 31:30.096
Cold!

31:30.930 --> 31:32.348
Do you want another blanket?

31:37.645 --> 31:38.646
Joey.

31:40.773 --> 31:42.150
Little street hustler,

31:42.775 --> 31:45.028
always said breathing in,

31:46.404 --> 31:47.280
breathing out.

31:49.824 --> 31:50.658
Eddie!

31:54.913 --> 31:57.248
You know, a lot's happened
since the last time I saw you.

31:57.332 --> 32:00.293
I'll bet, a lot of busts under the bridge.

32:00.376 --> 32:03.004
Yeah. I got married!

32:03.087 --> 32:04.923
-You're kidding!
-Yeah!

32:05.006 --> 32:08.051
Oh, that's great, Mick.
Tell me everything.

32:11.763 --> 32:13.640
She's very nice.

32:13.723 --> 32:15.266
Her name's Robin.

32:15.892 --> 32:18.353
-She's also a cop.
-I'm not surprised.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.398
We're gonna have a baby.

32:23.858 --> 32:24.776
Mick!

32:28.071 --> 32:29.697
Congratulations.

32:29.781 --> 32:31.532
Thank you very much, Eddie.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.369
-A little Belker.
-(laughs) Yeah!

32:37.580 --> 32:39.123
She's due in three weeks.

32:40.249 --> 32:41.668
You want a boy?

32:41.751 --> 32:44.003
I just want a healthy baby.

32:46.673 --> 32:47.757
I really want a boy.

32:47.840 --> 32:48.716
Yeah.

32:52.553 --> 32:54.222
Don't make fun of him, Mick.

32:56.182 --> 32:57.684
The way he walks.

33:00.436 --> 33:02.063
(voice breaking) I got to go, Eddie.

33:04.524 --> 33:06.025
Thanks for everything, Mick.

33:08.111 --> 33:09.404
This was my lucky day.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.324
I'm gonna come back and see you soon.

33:13.783 --> 33:15.118
Great!

33:15.201 --> 33:16.869
(melancholic music playing)

33:18.121 --> 33:19.831
You want any more of that ice cream?

33:21.416 --> 33:22.333
Thanks.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.173
I'll see you, Eddie.

33:29.716 --> 33:30.925
I'll see you, Mick.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.399
You're stepping all over my toes.

33:46.482 --> 33:48.067
Buntz accosts the girl on the street,

33:48.151 --> 33:50.236
your guys toss her apartment.
What's going on?

33:50.319 --> 33:52.030
Mary Franken is a resident of the Hill.

33:52.113 --> 33:54.699
I don't care if she lives on the moon.
It's a Heights case!

33:54.782 --> 33:56.159
Two of my men are dead.

33:56.242 --> 33:57.869
And one of my men is a possible suspect!

33:57.952 --> 34:00.955
We won't step beyond policy
and we'll inform you of anything we find,

34:01.039 --> 34:03.458
but I have every right
to make my own investigation.

34:03.541 --> 34:04.667
Okay, Frank.

34:06.085 --> 34:07.879
I thought we had a gentlemen's agreement.

34:09.756 --> 34:10.715
I was wrong.

34:16.637 --> 34:17.764
-Anything?
-Nothing.

34:17.847 --> 34:19.807
-Not exactly nothing.
-What do you mean?

34:19.891 --> 34:23.311
That's just the way I read her, Captain.
She was too smug about the search.

34:23.394 --> 34:26.105
-It wasn't there, but she's got something.
-Maybe she'd talk.

34:26.189 --> 34:28.775
-We tried. She's pretty hostile.
-She worshipped the guy.

34:28.858 --> 34:31.444
She figures they might hang me.
She wants to tie a little knot.

34:31.527 --> 34:34.405
All right, bring her in.
Don't ask her any questions, be pleasant,

34:34.489 --> 34:37.575
but bring her straight to my office.
Norm, you get out of sight.

34:39.368 --> 34:41.079
(siren wails)

34:44.707 --> 34:47.001
REPORTER: ...is being held as a hostage.

34:47.794 --> 34:49.754
He's got a knife on the judge
who sentenced him.

34:49.837 --> 34:51.923
-Wachtel?
-What's Wachtel doing up there?

34:52.006 --> 34:54.342
I don't know.
He's brought a couple of reporters.

34:54.425 --> 34:55.718
Showboating!

34:56.385 --> 34:59.347
-Where's Lieutenant Goldblume?
-He's on his way.

34:59.430 --> 35:01.057
We don't want to lose another one.

35:02.892 --> 35:03.768
What's going on?

35:03.851 --> 35:05.269
DUNLAW: Stay out! Just stay out!

35:06.604 --> 35:07.730
Oh, lord.

35:09.440 --> 35:12.485
All right, Mr. Dunlaw, now we're gonna
have to solve this thing

35:12.568 --> 35:13.861
before somebody gets hurt.

35:14.362 --> 35:16.614
You want to know how we solve it?
Get me out of here!

35:16.697 --> 35:19.909
We can't do that, Dunlaw.
That's what the judge sentenced you to do.

35:19.992 --> 35:22.537
(muffled)
Mr. Dunlaw, just let me talk to you.

35:22.620 --> 35:25.331
Now, look, the judge is trying
to say something.

35:25.414 --> 35:27.834
-Listen to him.
-Ungag him at least, Dunlaw.

35:27.917 --> 35:29.919
That's the man you got to talk to.

35:35.925 --> 35:37.385
All right, you just remember,

35:38.803 --> 35:40.555
I got the roast-beef knife, Judge.

35:40.638 --> 35:43.474
I simply want to say, Mr. Dunlaw,
that you're right.

35:45.226 --> 35:48.062
I've now made on-site inspections,
and, um...

35:48.938 --> 35:51.149
these people don't know
how to take care of a place.

35:51.941 --> 35:54.861
I mean, you fix it for them and they, uh,
they break it.

35:56.195 --> 35:58.781
Why bother with fixtures
when they're only gonna be stolen?

35:58.865 --> 36:01.659
That's it! You got it!

36:01.742 --> 36:04.787
It's like the bulbs.
They steal them right out of the hall!

36:04.871 --> 36:08.624
Right, and they, uh,
they bust the mailboxes.

36:08.708 --> 36:13.004
And they, uh, urinate in public areas.

36:14.714 --> 36:17.550
Well, Mr. Dunlaw,
I am commuting your sentence.

36:19.385 --> 36:22.305
Also, of course, you'll have amnesty
for this, um...

36:23.181 --> 36:24.849
(exhales) kidnapping.

36:26.184 --> 36:27.310
All right.

36:27.768 --> 36:30.104
All right, now that's
a reasonable man talking.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.190
I hope you all heard that!

36:32.815 --> 36:34.817
-Arrest this man!
-What?

36:34.901 --> 36:37.069
I gave you amnesty on the kidnap,

36:37.153 --> 36:41.574
not for felony endangerment,
not for possession of a weapon.

36:41.657 --> 36:43.034
Judas!

36:46.162 --> 36:47.705
Fingers were crossed, too.

36:48.247 --> 36:49.874
(crowd clamoring)

36:53.711 --> 36:56.047
REPORTER: Here he comes now.
Excuse me, Judge.

36:56.130 --> 36:57.882
Your Honor, what did you say to the guy?

36:57.965 --> 37:00.009
Did you really have
your fingers crossed, sir?

37:01.802 --> 37:05.723
Uh, could I trouble you
with one more news item?

37:06.515 --> 37:08.893
All right, you ready? Uh...

37:09.685 --> 37:13.648
After many months of soul-searching,

37:14.232 --> 37:17.109
"Give 'Em Hell" Wachtel
is today announcing

37:17.902 --> 37:20.238
his candidacy for superior court--

37:20.321 --> 37:22.573
My father is on me for years,

37:22.657 --> 37:26.244
"Go to law school, become a lawyer,
maybe later a judge.

37:26.327 --> 37:28.412
a respected member of the community."

37:28.496 --> 37:29.830
They're not all like that guy.

37:29.914 --> 37:31.415
I made the right decision.

37:31.874 --> 37:33.834
So far, I like being a cop.

37:33.918 --> 37:37.713
-How long you been in?
-4 1/2 years. You?

37:37.797 --> 37:40.716
Me? I just got out
of the academy in December.

37:41.717 --> 37:44.220
I guess that's why they partnered me up
with a veteran.

37:45.596 --> 37:46.931
No doubt.

37:47.014 --> 37:48.849
You still like it after four years?

37:48.933 --> 37:50.393
Depends on when I'm asked.

37:52.645 --> 37:53.729
What about right now?

37:54.730 --> 37:57.316
(laughs) Sure!

37:58.818 --> 38:00.611
I'll take that as a good sign.

38:03.197 --> 38:04.907
WACHTEL: In the face of controversy,

38:04.991 --> 38:08.953
judges pick up a rock
to see what vermin live beneath it

38:09.036 --> 38:10.538
and then crush it out.

38:11.539 --> 38:12.748
You never knew Tommy.

38:12.832 --> 38:13.916
No, I didn't.

38:14.875 --> 38:16.961
I'll bet you heard he was a bad cop.

38:17.044 --> 38:19.005
-Nothing was ever proved.
-That's right.

38:19.088 --> 38:21.132
And they never could
have proved it, either.

38:23.342 --> 38:26.929
Mary, did Tommy have any evidence
that might have worked in his defense?

38:28.139 --> 38:30.599
I never go through his stuff.
He wouldn't have liked that.

38:32.101 --> 38:34.270
But he said there were
things that were important.

38:36.105 --> 38:39.233
You know the best thing for everybody
would be just to clear all this up.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.235
You're not gonna try
and say Guido didn't shoot him.

38:41.319 --> 38:43.571
No. But maybe he had to.

38:45.740 --> 38:46.991
I know that.

38:48.409 --> 38:50.244
But I just can't help being mad at him.

38:50.328 --> 38:51.871
I'm just so mad at him!

39:00.046 --> 39:03.716
Mary, you said you had some things
that Tommy thought were important.

39:03.799 --> 39:05.885
Help me put all this to rest.

39:06.510 --> 39:07.803
Tell me where they are.

39:11.515 --> 39:14.435
I know you're mad at Guido.
May I tell you something? So am I.

39:17.480 --> 39:20.191
But that doesn't mean
I'm gonna turn my back on the truth.

39:22.151 --> 39:24.195
You can't run away from the truth, Mary.

39:28.616 --> 39:29.825
Nobody can.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.830
I've got a box of stuff
in the trunk of my car.

39:37.249 --> 39:38.667
It belonged to Delaberto.

39:40.044 --> 39:42.338
I wasn't supposed
to look at it, but I did.

39:44.924 --> 39:47.176
It makes Tommy look bad.

39:49.178 --> 39:50.304
(sniffling)

39:52.765 --> 39:55.518
I'm telling you,
with all the revisions and amendments,

39:55.601 --> 39:58.020
we have a grand total

39:58.729 --> 40:01.273
of 745 pages.

40:01.357 --> 40:03.526
Aw, that machine of yours must be busted.

40:03.609 --> 40:07.655
That's 62 more pages than we started with.

40:07.738 --> 40:12.159
The XJ-23 personal calculator
doesn't make mistakes, Jablonski.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.703
If we hadn't added those damn chartreuses,

40:14.787 --> 40:16.455
we'd be in good shape now.

40:16.539 --> 40:19.708
Who was it lobbed three extra pages
on the headgear section?

40:19.792 --> 40:21.961
Plastic rainhats.

40:22.044 --> 40:26.006
I'm telling you, if you just got a PC
with a 20-megabyte hard disk,

40:26.090 --> 40:27.842
you could store all these forms and--

40:27.925 --> 40:29.218
We hear you, we hear you.

40:29.301 --> 40:31.554
Maybe next year,
we'll get enough money appropriated

40:31.637 --> 40:33.806
so that we can look
into a computer system.

40:34.306 --> 40:39.687
Meanwhile, we're gonna have to live with
Old Faithful here another year.

40:40.271 --> 40:42.690
Maybe we didn't make a model manual,

40:42.773 --> 40:44.650
but I'm sure that we made
some improvements.

40:44.733 --> 40:46.235
My thanks to all of you

40:46.819 --> 40:49.488
and my apologies
for disrupting the meeting.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.449
Oh. Hey, Stan, don't worry about it.

40:51.532 --> 40:52.992
Thanks for the hospitality.

40:53.075 --> 40:54.368
(chatter)

40:56.162 --> 40:57.204
Take it easy.

40:59.665 --> 41:00.583
See you around, Lou.

41:00.666 --> 41:02.585
So long.

41:10.885 --> 41:11.886
See you, Lou.

41:12.678 --> 41:13.721
Yeah.

41:14.555 --> 41:16.056
I hope your nose is still working.

41:17.057 --> 41:19.435
Hey, come on.

41:19.518 --> 41:22.188
I've been hit harder
by my 12-year-old cousin.

41:22.271 --> 41:23.355
Yeah, sure.

41:23.439 --> 41:26.942
Hey, listen. Why don't you come down
to the bowling alley sometime?

41:27.026 --> 41:29.069
I'll introduce you to a couple babes.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.780
(laughing) Sure! Right!

41:31.864 --> 41:33.449
MELVIN: Here you go, Sarge.

41:33.532 --> 41:36.494
I drained this bacon like you asked,
but I don't know.

41:37.995 --> 41:39.413
Here, keep your head warm, Lou.

41:39.497 --> 41:41.790
Yeah, you bet. (laughs)

41:41.874 --> 41:43.125
Oh, yeah.

41:50.341 --> 41:51.175
Here we are.

41:51.759 --> 41:52.843
All ready for action.

41:53.385 --> 41:55.554
I'll see you all of a sudden, Stan.
(snaps fingers)

41:55.638 --> 41:58.974
(whistles)

42:04.021 --> 42:05.022
(snaps fingers)

42:07.316 --> 42:10.110
Uh-huh, here it is.
Here's the winner, right here.

42:10.819 --> 42:13.948
Delaberto's list of stuff
Donahue stole off the crime scene.

42:14.031 --> 42:17.076
Sealed bottle of pharmaceutical cocaine

42:17.159 --> 42:20.162
and two firearms, 9mm P38.

42:20.246 --> 42:22.831
They took out 2 9mm slugs from Delaberto.

42:22.915 --> 42:26.752
Other piece is a .25-caliber
Beretta automatic.

42:26.835 --> 42:28.379
That's the gun he aimed
at you, right, Norm?

42:28.462 --> 42:30.130
-Yeah, that's right.
-Serial numbers?

42:31.257 --> 42:32.383
Right here.

42:32.466 --> 42:34.385
Delaberto was building
quite a little case.

42:34.468 --> 42:35.636
Against Donahue, Captain.

42:35.719 --> 42:37.388
Not against Donahue and Buntz.

42:37.471 --> 42:40.599
FRANK: Okay. Run the numbers
and be sure IAD gets that material.

42:40.683 --> 42:43.227
And be sure that the Heights gets
a covering memo.

42:43.310 --> 42:44.436
On its way.

42:45.938 --> 42:48.315
So, uh, is that gonna cover it, Captain?

42:48.816 --> 42:52.278
Ajanian may still want a board of rights
for your conduct with the loan shark.

42:52.361 --> 42:53.696
That folds. It's a crock.

42:53.779 --> 42:55.447
It was Donahue being a jerk.

42:55.531 --> 42:58.367
Norman, I would like
to go forward with the feeling

42:58.450 --> 43:01.161
that nothing like this Donahue incident
will ever happen again.

43:02.997 --> 43:04.957
How could it ever happen again, Captain?

43:05.916 --> 43:07.543
Tommy was my only friend...

43:08.544 --> 43:09.753
and I shot him.

43:13.173 --> 43:14.758
Reporter at my desk wants a statement

43:14.842 --> 43:16.635
regarding what action
you're taking against Buntz.

43:16.719 --> 43:19.888
There are no specific charges
which demand any immediate actions.

43:19.972 --> 43:22.057
Ajanian is giving interviews,

43:22.141 --> 43:24.852
calling Buntz renegade,
implying you're protecting him.

43:24.935 --> 43:25.978
I better talk to him.

43:29.231 --> 43:30.941
Captain, Mr. Wells.

43:31.025 --> 43:34.612
I know I should have called,
but it's important we talk in private.

43:35.070 --> 43:36.739
Catch up with you in a minute, Henry.

43:38.782 --> 43:39.867
(sighs)

43:43.746 --> 43:47.666
Ozzie has let us know that he feels
this Buntz thing might discredit you.

43:47.750 --> 43:49.668
He's coming back to life,
but don't worry about that.

43:49.752 --> 43:51.420
There's something in the works
that will take care of that.

43:51.503 --> 43:53.172
What are you talking about, Graham?

43:53.255 --> 43:57.384
Frank, in politics, being uninformed
is sometimes simply expedient.

43:57.468 --> 43:59.511
If something's going on,
I want to know about it.

43:59.595 --> 44:02.264
You will know about it
when the time is right, which is not now.

44:02.348 --> 44:05.351
Now we have to discuss what action
to take regarding your man Buntz.

44:05.434 --> 44:06.477
Meaning what?

44:07.853 --> 44:11.148
You make an announcement that openly
expresses your disdain for his actions.

44:11.231 --> 44:14.360
Ideally, an announcement
that says he's being transferred.

44:14.777 --> 44:17.363
Before you announce your candidacy,
this has to be put to bed.

44:17.446 --> 44:20.366
I've already taken care
of this directly with Buntz.

44:20.449 --> 44:23.035
You haven't taken care of it
for the voters of this city.

44:23.118 --> 44:24.953
They already heard
and read enough about Buntz

44:25.037 --> 44:26.747
to taint you before you even get started.

44:27.581 --> 44:32.461
Frank, I've got to tell you
that this announcement

44:32.544 --> 44:36.006
has an importance
beyond its obvious PR value.

44:36.090 --> 44:37.132
Which is?

44:38.217 --> 44:40.094
I have to feel that we can work together.

44:40.177 --> 44:42.012
You're saying this is a kind of test.

44:42.096 --> 44:45.140
Not a test, but a demonstration
that you can be part of a team,

44:45.224 --> 44:46.725
that you're not gonna be a maverick.

44:47.393 --> 44:50.020
Believe me, this is important.

44:50.104 --> 44:51.563
I've told you before, Graham.

44:51.647 --> 44:55.067
I will not use my job here to serve
the needs of any political campaign.

44:56.402 --> 45:00.072
Well, if that's really your position,

45:00.155 --> 45:01.657
I guess we can skip dinner tomorrow.

45:01.740 --> 45:02.866
Well, it's my position.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.203
-We'll be in touch.
-I'll be here.

45:28.934 --> 45:30.352
When did this happen?

45:30.978 --> 45:32.980
Found him about an hour ago.

45:34.189 --> 45:35.274
Are you a friend?

45:37.693 --> 45:39.403
I'm a police officer.

45:41.447 --> 45:43.115
(voice breaking) And I'm a friend.

45:43.198 --> 45:45.951
If you're an intimate friend,
you better get tested.

45:46.452 --> 45:47.453
Go ahead.

45:51.749 --> 45:52.916
Excuse me.

45:53.876 --> 45:55.169
Just a minute.

45:57.796 --> 46:00.215
(melancholic music playing)

46:13.520 --> 46:14.730
FRANK: Are you upset?

46:15.856 --> 46:17.733
I have to admit I'm a little disappointed.

46:19.985 --> 46:22.529
But you understand why I couldn't go
through with it.

46:23.238 --> 46:24.782
I'm trying, Frank.

46:25.866 --> 46:27.326
I thought I explained everything.

46:27.409 --> 46:28.368
You did.

46:28.994 --> 46:31.163
It's just hard for me
to overcome the feeling

46:31.246 --> 46:33.999
that Norman Buntz kept
you from becoming mayor.

46:34.082 --> 46:36.877
No, no! It was the politics.

46:38.420 --> 46:40.547
It was just starting
to get to a place where...

46:42.466 --> 46:43.884
I knew I could never fit in.

46:43.967 --> 46:46.220
WOMAN (on TV): <i>...by total surprise.</i>
-There's Ozzie.

46:46.303 --> 46:47.971
<i>...could not be identified by name,</i>

46:48.055 --> 46:51.058
<i>was apparently</i>
<i>an outstanding political science student</i>

46:51.141 --> 46:54.478
<i>who was interned</i>
<i>on a study project at City Hall.</i>

46:54.561 --> 46:57.022
<i>Cathy Korngold is at City Hall now.</i>

46:57.105 --> 46:58.565
<i>Cathy, can you hear me?</i>

46:58.649 --> 47:01.443
<i>Yes, I'm here with Police Chief Daniels.</i>

47:01.527 --> 47:04.279
<i>Chief Daniels, will the mayor be indicted?</i>

47:05.280 --> 47:06.782
<i>Well, we have given the evidence,</i>

47:06.865 --> 47:10.285
<i>which we believe supports charges</i>
<i>of attempted child molestation</i>

47:10.369 --> 47:13.163
<i>and lewd and immoral conduct,</i>
<i>to the district attorney's office.</i>

47:13.247 --> 47:14.665
<i>And in your opinion,</i>

47:14.748 --> 47:17.751
<i>should Mayor Cleveland resign</i>
<i>now that he faces these charges?</i>

47:17.835 --> 47:20.587
Graham Wells said
Ozzie would be taken care of.

47:20.671 --> 47:22.714
-So do you think it was a setup?
-Yes!

47:22.798 --> 47:25.259
<i>I do feel that in the coming elections,</i>

47:25.342 --> 47:27.427
<i>the voters should seek beyond</i>

47:27.511 --> 47:29.972
<i>the prole-offered political choices.</i>

47:30.055 --> 47:31.640
<i>Seek a person whose qualifications</i>

47:31.723 --> 47:33.976
<i>are known to them</i>
<i>directly through his efforts</i>

47:34.059 --> 47:37.437
<i>-and not the creations of a political--</i>
-No, Daniels is still talking.

47:37.521 --> 47:42.025
(laughs) He's giving a campaign speech,
now that the field's clear.

47:43.360 --> 47:44.736
You don't want to hear?

47:46.488 --> 47:49.616
I've lost my interest in politics.

47:50.868 --> 47:52.035
(chuckles)

48:00.252 --> 48:02.254
(theme music playing)
