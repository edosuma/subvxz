[church bell rings]

00:07.173 --> 00:11.219
[vocalizing]

00:11.302 --> 00:15.056
In the name of the creator,
our brother Jesus, and Wisdom, Sophia,

00:15.140 --> 00:19.060
we thank you for the gift of this day,
for our first breath this morning.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.021
In your name, we pray. Amen.

00:32.574 --> 00:34.242
[Karamo] Like to know who we're helping?

00:34.325 --> 00:35.785
-[Bobby] Yeah!
-[Jonathan] Yes!

00:35.869 --> 00:37.746
[Karamo] Her name is Alison McCrary.

00:37.829 --> 00:41.332
"Alison is 40 years old and lives in
the Gentilly neighborhood of New Orleans."

00:41.416 --> 00:45.128
"She is a social-justice lawyer
and advocate for human rights."

00:45.211 --> 00:46.379
Good for her!

00:46.463 --> 00:49.215
I'm trained professionally as an attorney,

00:49.299 --> 00:51.426
but I feel like I did life
a little backwards

00:51.509 --> 00:55.930
because I was 25 years old when I started
the process of becoming a sister.

00:56.973 --> 00:59.726
-[Karamo] A nun?
-Oh my God! Sister Act!

01:00.226 --> 01:03.313
-We are having a Sister Act moment.
-I hope she's like the redheaded one!

01:03.396 --> 01:04.939
Or the brunette!

01:05.023 --> 01:06.357
Oh, I love Kathy Najimy.

01:06.441 --> 01:10.862
[Alison] I left life as a Catholic sister
in 2020 when I was 38

01:10.945 --> 01:15.784
because, as Catholic sisters, we make vows
of poverty, celibacy, and obedience,

01:15.867 --> 01:19.120
but I would like to have
a long-term relationship with someone,

01:19.204 --> 01:21.915
someone who knows me
on a really deep level.

01:21.998 --> 01:25.376
"Alison is nominated by her dear friend
from the church, Miss Deedy."

01:25.460 --> 01:28.338
When Alison told me
she was leaving the convent,

01:29.839 --> 01:31.966
I was like, "Okay!"

01:32.550 --> 01:33.468
"Okay now."

01:34.052 --> 01:36.638
"Let's go full speed ahead,"

01:36.721 --> 01:40.475
because Alison is a phenomenal woman.

01:40.558 --> 01:42.936
She has a big heart,

01:43.019 --> 01:46.064
and she gives 100% of herself.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.650
If she can help you, she's gonna help you.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.360
"Alison is as a real-life saint."

01:50.443 --> 01:53.738
"Her commitment to her community
and social causes runs so deep,

01:53.822 --> 01:55.782
she even opens her home to anyone in need,

01:55.865 --> 02:00.829
whether an ex-convict, refugee,
or someone simply down on their luck."

02:00.912 --> 02:02.747
-I love her already.
-Right?

02:02.831 --> 02:07.085
I also serve as a spiritual advisor
on Louisiana's death row,

02:07.669 --> 02:11.673
and I've been visiting the people
on death row for about 17 years.

02:11.756 --> 02:15.051
Alison is involved in so much,

02:15.135 --> 02:18.263
but to make space for someone,

02:18.346 --> 02:21.599
if you wanna be involved
in a relationship,

02:21.683 --> 02:23.726
you have to put the brakes on things.

02:23.810 --> 02:27.147
"It's been 15 years
since Alison had a long-term relationship,

02:27.230 --> 02:30.233
and she feels like she missed out
on developing her social skills."

02:30.316 --> 02:32.443
She did have an LTR with Jesus.

02:32.527 --> 02:34.946
She did have a long-term relationship
with Jesus. That is true.

02:35.029 --> 02:38.950
I wasn't able to…
to date when I was a sister.

02:39.033 --> 02:41.828
We have a vow of celibacy,
so we're not allowed to date

02:41.911 --> 02:44.455
or have romantic or sexual relationships,

02:44.539 --> 02:47.417
but before I was a Catholic sister,
I did date some,

02:47.500 --> 02:49.377
but I was very young
and a very different person,

02:49.460 --> 02:54.132
so when I first left the convent,
I was really nervous about meeting people

02:54.215 --> 02:56.176
and there was a lot
I needed to figure out.

02:56.259 --> 02:58.428
First dates are hard. They really are.

02:58.511 --> 03:00.889
Especially, like,
you learn first dates in your 20s.

03:00.972 --> 03:02.307
-Yeah.
-[Bobby] She didn't do that.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.641
-It takes practice.
-Yeah.

03:03.725 --> 03:09.147
The person who dates Alison
must have a lot of energy.

03:09.731 --> 03:11.816
You better take your vitamins,

03:11.900 --> 03:14.736
you better start jogging,
running, working out,

03:14.819 --> 03:18.072
because you're gonna have to be ready
for Alison.

03:18.156 --> 03:19.574
She's a firecracker.

03:19.657 --> 03:20.742
The spreadsheet. [chuckles]

03:21.534 --> 03:26.331
I created a little rubric for dating,
and then I made it into a spreadsheet.

03:26.414 --> 03:27.248
[laughs]

03:27.332 --> 03:30.752
Each criteria
is given a certain number of points,

03:30.835 --> 03:34.797
and then those columns
have built-in formulas to give a score.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.966
It helps me to remember
what is important to me

03:37.050 --> 03:39.385
and to look objectively at some things.

03:39.469 --> 03:40.386
It's a tool.

03:40.470 --> 03:41.554
That's just too much.

03:42.138 --> 03:43.389
Lord. [sighs]

03:44.098 --> 03:45.558
Whoosah.

03:46.267 --> 03:49.145
My baby needs a new attitude.

03:49.229 --> 03:52.315
[Karamo] "Alison's friends from both
inside and outside her church community

03:52.398 --> 03:55.485
want the Fab Five to help her transition
from her life as a nun

03:55.568 --> 03:57.987
so she can fully embrace
the rest of her life."

03:58.071 --> 04:00.281
-We can do that!
-Never too late, Alison!

04:00.365 --> 04:02.367
It's never too late to find love.

04:03.117 --> 04:04.369
It's never too late.

04:04.452 --> 04:08.414
And I think the Fab Five could help her

04:08.498 --> 04:12.168
because Alison is missing a love life.

04:12.252 --> 04:16.673
[Karamo] So our mission this week is
to help this former nun find a future hon.

-Hi! So--
-Hold on. [laughs]

04:57.380 --> 04:59.007
Alison's laugh is very infectious.

You can't help but smile
and start to giggle with her.

05:02.635 --> 05:05.013
How do you have a sweater on? Hi!

05:05.096 --> 05:07.348
-[Alison] How are you?
-[Tan] So nice to meet you!

05:07.432 --> 05:09.934
-Hi!
-[Antoni] Are those bananas?

05:10.018 --> 05:11.686
[Alison] Those are actually plantains,

05:11.769 --> 05:13.062
but those are bananas.

05:13.146 --> 05:14.397
Those are baby bananas,

05:14.480 --> 05:17.150
and there are figs, papayas, grapes.

05:17.233 --> 05:18.776
I love this garden vibe.

05:18.860 --> 05:22.947
I am living for this Armageddon,
end-of-days, Panic Room garden, honey.

05:23.031 --> 05:26.576
Blackberries, pomegranates, lemons.

05:26.659 --> 05:30.872
She's giving conscientious,
"I'm canning tomatoes because I am ready."

05:30.955 --> 05:34.584
"My garden is ready to give me sustenance
through whatever may come my way."

05:34.667 --> 05:36.210
-What's it like inside?
-[Alison] Uh…

05:36.794 --> 05:37.754
My house inside?

05:37.837 --> 05:39.088
[Bobby] Can we see inside?

05:39.172 --> 05:40.965
-Okay!
-[Tan] Lead the way!

05:41.049 --> 05:43.760
-This is my house.
-Your house is super cute.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.511
She said, "Ceilings."

05:45.595 --> 05:48.181
[Bobby] I love this big table.
Do you have a lot of people over?

05:48.264 --> 05:50.641
[Alison] Yeah,
I like to cook a lot for people,

05:50.725 --> 05:52.894
and I like to have people over for meals.

05:52.977 --> 05:54.771
This is such a great kitchen.

05:54.854 --> 05:56.814
[Jonathan]
Look at all your gorgeous spices.

05:56.898 --> 05:59.025
Yeah, that's a little apothecary.

05:59.108 --> 06:00.651
Food and plant medicine.

06:00.735 --> 06:02.570
Everything is very labeled.

06:02.653 --> 06:05.782
-[Tan] You are fully type A.
-[Alison laughs]

06:05.865 --> 06:08.826
-[Bobby] Alison, what's this?
-[Alison] The Sacred Universe story.

06:08.910 --> 06:11.037
So it's from the Big Bang to present day,

06:11.120 --> 06:16.167
connecting evolution and creation
and spirituality and science.

06:16.250 --> 06:17.585
-Wow.
-I really love.

06:17.668 --> 06:20.671
Everything about Alison's house
is making my little Virgo heart happy.

06:20.755 --> 06:24.717
The timeline of evolution
in a former nun's home

06:24.801 --> 06:27.804
is not something I was expecting to see,
and I like it.

06:27.887 --> 06:29.055
What's upstairs?

06:29.138 --> 06:31.641
[Alison] Upstairs, okay, so…

06:31.724 --> 06:34.018
-[Bobby] Is this your bedroom?
-This is where I sleep.

06:34.102 --> 06:36.729
[Antoni] Bobby, there's literally
a sign on the door.

06:36.813 --> 06:38.064
It says it's my room.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.273
[Bobby] I love it.

06:39.357 --> 06:42.443
There's order
and then there's, like, extreme order.

06:42.527 --> 06:45.405
A lot of the nuns would always say,
"Cleanliness is holiness,"

06:45.488 --> 06:47.824
and so I want them organized.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.410
Where's the messy?
I wanna see some cracks.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.078
We love journaling.

06:52.161 --> 06:55.123
[Jonathan]
"I will not comply with sexism."

06:55.206 --> 06:57.083
[Antoni] "Thin preference
is about capitalism,

06:57.166 --> 06:58.668
white supremacy, and patriarchy."

06:58.751 --> 07:01.170
-Yes, it is, queen!
-[laughs]

07:01.254 --> 07:04.132
-[Tan] Why do you have a kettle here?
-[Alison] Every morning, I make tea.

07:04.215 --> 07:07.427
[Tan] You got a tea station in
your bedroom? Is this a meditation space?

07:07.510 --> 07:09.679
-[Alison] This is the chapel.
-[Tan] Oh, it's a chapel!

07:09.762 --> 07:12.014
You have a chapel in your bedroom. Okay.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.601
Is that holy water on the wall?

07:16.310 --> 07:17.812
Yes. Yes, it is.

07:17.895 --> 07:21.232
[Alison] These are my prayer books,
The Liturgy of the Hours,

07:21.315 --> 07:25.069
and this is where I sit to pray
after I come and sage myself.

07:25.153 --> 07:27.488
-This is really nice!
-Some holy water here.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.616
[Jonathan] You're just getting in touch
with your highest self in the morning.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.160
I love that!

07:33.119 --> 07:34.662
I love this room.

07:34.745 --> 07:38.374
I exercise in here.
It's like a everything room.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.751
And I write,
and I do some artwork in here.

07:40.835 --> 07:43.337
-Like a man cave. This is your woman cave.
-Yeah. [laughs]

07:43.421 --> 07:45.298
I can't get over these labels.

07:45.381 --> 07:48.176
How much label tape
do you go through monthly?

07:48.259 --> 07:49.218
[Karamo] A lot.

07:49.302 --> 07:52.430
If you spent half the time dating
that you did making labels…

07:52.513 --> 07:54.307
[laughs] I might have a little luck!

07:55.224 --> 07:57.852
[Bobby] On the surface,
Alison seems pretty put together.

07:57.935 --> 08:01.022
She seems giggly and happy
and organized and labeled.

08:01.105 --> 08:02.982
[Antoni] We're gonna go politely explore.

08:03.065 --> 08:05.234
[Bobby] But I think
she might be hiding some things,

08:05.318 --> 08:07.862
and not, like, a dead body in the garden.

08:09.238 --> 08:13.868
Gosh, everything
just reads "much older lady."

08:14.368 --> 08:16.704
Alison's closet is…

08:19.457 --> 08:20.374
strange.

08:20.458 --> 08:26.839
All that can go.

08:26.923 --> 08:28.966
Like, everything that's dowdy.

08:29.050 --> 08:30.968
It sounds like you use your home

08:31.052 --> 08:33.554
as an extension
of all the amazing work you do.

08:33.638 --> 08:36.390
Yeah. One friend is like,
"Alison, your desk is by your front door."

08:36.474 --> 08:38.476
"You look like a receptionist
to your own house."

08:38.559 --> 08:41.229
Like, "Hi, are you here to see Alison?
Let me go get her."

08:41.312 --> 08:43.689
-"Did you make an appointment?"
-[Alison laughs] Right?

08:43.773 --> 08:45.358
And so this is where I write,

08:45.441 --> 08:51.489
but I haven't really had time
to make it more inspiring or comfortable.

08:51.572 --> 08:54.200
-But it's organized.
-It's organized!

08:54.283 --> 08:56.369
♪ Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo ♪

08:56.452 --> 08:59.580
♪ Doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo ♪

08:59.664 --> 09:00.873
-♪ Doo, doo, doo ♪
-♪ Doo… ♪

09:00.957 --> 09:03.042
[Antoni] Every single drawer is labeled.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.836
This woman needs some kind
of a sponsorship for a label maker.

09:05.920 --> 09:07.046
It's intense.

09:07.547 --> 09:08.881
Wow.

09:08.965 --> 09:11.467
[Bobby] Wait. What's in here?
"God's coming, and they're pissed."

09:11.551 --> 09:13.844
-Jonathan--
-I love a nonbinary bag!

09:13.928 --> 09:15.346
-[Alison laughs]
-So cute!

09:15.930 --> 09:16.931
Oh my God.

09:17.014 --> 09:18.724
-I thought you would like it.
-I love it.

09:18.808 --> 09:22.687
It goes with your outfit.
She's in tie-dye today too. It's perfect.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.188
Who even needs that other bag?

09:24.272 --> 09:25.147
So good.

09:25.731 --> 09:28.401
-Thank you for my bag. I love it.
-I thought you would.

09:28.484 --> 09:30.987
-[Jonathan] Won't you miss it?
-No. I took a picture of it.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.698
So, okay, you have gorgeous hair.

09:33.781 --> 09:37.410
-Thank you. It's a little like yours.
-It looks really gorgeous.

09:37.493 --> 09:39.829
There's so many fun things
to do with curly hair.

09:39.912 --> 09:41.205
I cut it myself.

09:41.289 --> 09:45.376
When I wash it, I flip it upside down,
put it in a ponytail, and I…

09:45.459 --> 09:46.877
-Okay. Cute.
-Yeah.

09:46.961 --> 09:50.006
But, I mean, you were, like,
a literal, full-on nun for 14 years.

09:50.089 --> 09:52.800
Is there anything beauty-wise
that you've never learned how to do

09:52.883 --> 09:54.385
that you really wanna do?

09:54.468 --> 09:58.264
[Alison] I never learned how to put on
makeup. This is actually for Mardi Gras.

09:58.347 --> 10:00.558
Got it. You don't have a lot
of daily-wear stuff.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.268
It's more glittery, bright stuff.

10:02.351 --> 10:06.147
Sometimes I think people think,
like, "Oh, beauty is about how I look."

10:06.230 --> 10:09.358
"I don't care about the way I look,
thus I'm not gonna care about it."

10:09.442 --> 10:12.111
But it's actually
about how we treat ourselves.

10:12.194 --> 10:14.739
So I would be curious
if we could, like, allow your mission

10:14.822 --> 10:17.158
of, like, caring and being in community

10:17.241 --> 10:19.368
to extend to yourself just a smidgen.

10:19.452 --> 10:21.621
[jazzy music playing]

10:29.837 --> 10:31.505
[Karamo] Hmm.

10:32.882 --> 10:34.467
What do we have here?

10:36.135 --> 10:38.304
So, for the first time in history,

10:38.387 --> 10:40.389
I didn't have to guess
what was in a drawer

10:40.473 --> 10:41.891
because everything is super labeled.

10:42.642 --> 10:45.311
But I'm curious,
where is your messy drawer?

10:46.896 --> 10:49.523
-Have you heard of a messy drawer?
-Yeah, a junk drawer.

10:49.607 --> 10:51.400
I don't have a junk drawer.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.903
You don't have a junk drawer?

10:53.986 --> 10:55.946
-No. Did you find a junk drawer?
-I'm not--

10:56.030 --> 10:57.740
-I don't know.
-I'm not, like…

10:57.823 --> 10:59.867
I know we don't know each other yet,

10:59.950 --> 11:03.245
but I'm not, like, sneaky and sly.
I'm genuinely asking you.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.413
[Alison] Yeah.

11:04.497 --> 11:10.753
There's this initial appearance
of kind of a perfectly-curated life.

11:11.879 --> 11:15.675
And whenever I see something like that,
I just always wonder what's beneath.

11:15.758 --> 11:18.302
When you left vowed religious life,

11:18.386 --> 11:21.180
you left because you had certain needs
that weren't being met.

11:21.263 --> 11:23.391
-Is that safe to say?
-[Alison] Uh, yeah.

11:23.474 --> 11:27.436
I loved being a Catholic sister,
but was really realizing that I had needs,

11:27.520 --> 11:30.523
and the container that's holding my life

11:30.606 --> 11:33.359
isn't allowing me
to have those needs filled.

11:33.442 --> 11:36.612
-Mainly around intimacy needs, yeah.
-Okay, so intimacy needs.

11:36.696 --> 11:40.825
But intimacy isn't just physical.
Intimacy is like "into-me-see."

11:40.908 --> 11:42.076
"See into me."

11:42.159 --> 11:43.536
-Like, "Get to know me."
-Okay.

11:43.619 --> 11:47.581
-Um, I am biromantic demisexual.
-Okay.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.250
Um, yeah.

11:49.333 --> 11:53.546
It means I'm romantically attracted
to men, women, nonbinary folks,

11:53.629 --> 11:57.550
but I'm only sexually attracted to people
if there's an emotional connection.

11:57.633 --> 11:59.593
-[Antoni] So how's all that going for you?
-Um…

11:59.677 --> 12:02.930
-Do you like going on dates?
-I like getting to know people.

12:03.013 --> 12:05.766
But my friend,
she had a bar crawl, and I love her,

12:05.850 --> 12:08.227
and it was fun, but I was so uncomfortable

12:08.310 --> 12:12.440
just 'cause I'm like, "Everyone knows what
to order at all these different bars,"

12:12.523 --> 12:15.860
and I just didn't know what to order.
I just got water.

12:15.943 --> 12:19.530
Well, if you're going on dates
and if that's something you wanna do,

12:19.613 --> 12:22.032
it's like,
you should be able to go into a bar,

12:22.116 --> 12:25.870
and be like, "Am I in the mood for
a mocktail, a cocktail, a glass of wine?"

12:25.953 --> 12:28.581
So you can get that out of the way
and get to know the person.

12:28.664 --> 12:29.540
Yeah.

12:29.623 --> 12:30.624
[Jonathan] Ha!

12:30.708 --> 12:33.002
[whimsical music playing]

12:38.090 --> 12:40.134
-You're single. Am I right?
-I am, yeah.

12:40.217 --> 12:42.344
But you're ready to mingle.
Am I also right?

12:42.428 --> 12:43.554
I think so!

12:43.637 --> 12:45.222
What are you wearing on your dates?

12:45.306 --> 12:47.767
What I wear, it's, like, tried and true.

12:47.850 --> 12:51.562
Okay.
It is what I would call modest clothing.

12:51.645 --> 12:53.689
-Yes.
-[Tan] Do you wanna be modest always?

12:53.773 --> 12:54.982
I mean, maybe…

12:55.065 --> 12:59.361
There's maybe some occasions
where something else might be needed.

12:59.945 --> 13:02.907
But I'm usually just really uncomfortable…

13:02.990 --> 13:04.867
Okay. I wanna talk through your closet.

13:04.950 --> 13:06.702
-Let's figure it out.
-Yeah.

13:06.786 --> 13:10.831
Why do you have twos of everything?
What ark are you trying to fill?

13:10.915 --> 13:13.584
-[laughs] An ark!
-[Tan] Full of women who dress the same?

13:13.667 --> 13:15.336
What, do they go two by two?

13:15.419 --> 13:17.087
-[laughs]
-[Tan] What's going on?

13:17.171 --> 13:20.382
[Alison] When I like something,
I try to find the same thing.

13:20.466 --> 13:22.092
Like, these are from the thrift store,

13:22.176 --> 13:24.845
and I'm like, "The universe
wants me to wear this dress."

13:24.929 --> 13:25.846
"They know I like it."

13:25.930 --> 13:32.228
However, it's feeling a little… older
than I would care for you to look.

13:32.728 --> 13:35.564
Yeah. Yeah,
and I wear cardigans over those.

13:35.648 --> 13:37.650
[pensive music playing]

13:37.733 --> 13:41.028
Wow. Do you live in Utah
in your spare time?

13:41.111 --> 13:43.197
[Alison] I have
some good Mormon friends though.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.741
All my friends and family are Mormon.
I live in Utah!

13:46.325 --> 13:50.412
But this is
like a woman much older in Utah.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.706
I like that I don't have to think
about what I wear.

13:52.790 --> 13:56.126
So what I wear to testify
in the state legislature

13:56.210 --> 13:57.920
on a bill-airing committee

13:58.003 --> 14:01.298
is the same thing that I will wear
to do my gardening in the backyard.

14:01.382 --> 14:02.424
How about a date?

14:03.384 --> 14:05.135
And the same thing I wear on a date.

14:05.219 --> 14:06.387
-It's all the same.
-Oh.

14:06.470 --> 14:07.888
[Alison] Yeah. It doesn't change.

14:14.144 --> 14:16.146
[Karamo] Do you think
people see the real you?

14:16.230 --> 14:18.190
I think they do.

14:18.274 --> 14:21.151
I see everything's organized,
and I see the beautiful garden.

14:21.235 --> 14:24.154
I think people look at me
and think I have it together. [chuckles]

14:24.238 --> 14:26.824
-You know? And--
-So what don't you have together?

14:27.324 --> 14:30.494
Oh, gosh.
I mean, whether it's issues of trust

14:30.578 --> 14:34.623
or needs to feel control over things, um,

14:34.707 --> 14:36.125
feeling insecure,

14:36.208 --> 14:39.420
and then appearing more confident
than I might be.

14:39.503 --> 14:42.339
I mean, there's
just a laundry list of all the things.

14:42.423 --> 14:44.675
Yeah. How often do you help yourself?

14:46.635 --> 14:51.181
I mean, I feel like I try
to schedule in the practices. [chuckles]

14:51.265 --> 14:52.266
Um…

14:52.766 --> 14:55.978
You know? Meeting with counselors.

14:56.061 --> 14:58.397
-I said yourself.
-Yeah. Um…

14:58.480 --> 15:00.441
So how much time you take for yourself?

15:01.692 --> 15:02.568
[chuckles]

15:02.651 --> 15:04.945
[heartfelt music playing]

15:05.613 --> 15:07.781
-This is hard. [chuckles]
-No, it's okay.

15:08.407 --> 15:11.952
A lot of my relationships end up being
like caretaking relationships, you know?

15:12.036 --> 15:14.788
Just kind of patterns
of having to care for people.

15:14.872 --> 15:17.499
[Karamo] Yeah. Is it exhausting sometimes,
always giving?

15:17.583 --> 15:18.918
-Of course.
-[Karamo] Yeah.

15:19.501 --> 15:21.837
-[Alison] It's a habit.
-[Karamo] That's how you been taught.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.297
Yeah. Yeah.

15:23.380 --> 15:26.550
Yeah, and sometimes I think,
like, you know, with being a sister,

15:26.634 --> 15:28.469
in my mind, it was to get close.

15:28.552 --> 15:31.055
You know, it's like, "We're here
to love everyone who needs love,"

15:31.138 --> 15:34.308
and it was also a way of avoiding what…

15:35.976 --> 15:38.520
um, what I might really need.

15:38.604 --> 15:42.191
[Karamo] Whatever you need in your heart,
you should've gotten that.

15:42.274 --> 15:44.276
Yeah. Thanks.

15:50.616 --> 15:51.700
We are back.

15:51.784 --> 15:52.701
-Hi!
-Hi!

15:52.785 --> 15:54.203
-[Jonathan] Hi!
-[Alison chuckles]

15:54.286 --> 15:57.998
So how do you feel about allowing us
to do what we know how to do?

15:58.082 --> 16:01.627
Oh! Um, yeah. I mean,
I think y'all are, like, experts, right?

16:01.710 --> 16:04.546
That's the title.
Jury's out, frankly, but…

16:04.630 --> 16:05.506
[laughs]

16:05.589 --> 16:07.549
Yeah. Yeah. I think I…
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

-[Karamo] You're coming with us.
-I am?

16:09.551 --> 16:10.928

Grab a comfy pair of shoes, and let's go.

16:22.815 --> 16:26.986
[Bobby] I feel like Alison might be
using her activism

16:27.069 --> 16:31.198
to hide the work
that she needs to do on herself.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.450
So I think my biggest goal this week

16:33.534 --> 16:36.370
is to really help push Alison
out of her comfort zone.

16:36.453 --> 16:40.416
And I wanna show her a way
to utilize her space

16:40.499 --> 16:44.628
that can help her change some other things
in her life for the better.

16:44.712 --> 16:47.006
[Jonathan]
Alison is a little bit très uptight.

16:47.089 --> 16:50.426
She maybe forgot
how to have a little bit of fun,

16:50.509 --> 16:54.722
but, lucky for her, my middle name is fun.

16:54.805 --> 16:57.599
So I want for us to just get
into a little sandbox

16:57.683 --> 16:59.101
that is beauty and play.

17:00.352 --> 17:04.523
[Tan] She has
so many clothes in her closet,

17:04.606 --> 17:06.859
but, right now,
everything's so functional.

17:06.942 --> 17:08.402
It just serves a purpose.

17:08.485 --> 17:10.904
I wanna get rid of the matronly clothes,

17:10.988 --> 17:15.242
and I want to show her
what fashion can do for her self-esteem.

17:16.118 --> 17:19.079
If you know what your drink is,
it's one less thing to stress with

17:19.163 --> 17:20.497
so that you can be yourself,

17:20.581 --> 17:22.708
and you can show up
as a curious human being

17:22.791 --> 17:25.127
and get to know the person
you're on a date with.

17:25.210 --> 17:28.088

you gotta let go of control.

so she can practice getting out there,

17:40.184 --> 17:43.353

Welcome to Queenly Conjure.
My name is Lorena.

-Thanks!

[Lorena] Of course. Thank you.

-Maybe!
-There's no maybe about that!

18:32.861 --> 18:35.364
I don't know!
I also sense people's energy a lot.

-You like that energy.
-She has good energy.

18:37.533 --> 18:38.700
[Karamo] I saw it!

18:38.784 --> 18:40.202
You were like, "Hi."

18:40.285 --> 18:42.037
-You were, like, "Oh, tea?"
-[laughs]

18:42.121 --> 18:43.831
I like that opening up of you,
you know?

18:43.914 --> 18:47.000
Because I know you said that
a large part of that was closed off.

18:47.084 --> 18:49.503
As a sister, we have a…
We had a vow of celibacy.

18:49.586 --> 18:51.880
So, of course, we have attractions.
That's normal,

18:51.964 --> 18:53.757
but, like,
we can't act on those attractions.

18:53.841 --> 18:56.176
So everything just went friend zone,
you know?

18:56.260 --> 18:57.928
-Yes.
-Um, now it's confusing.

18:58.011 --> 18:59.596
Alison was a nun for 14 years.

18:59.680 --> 19:02.141
She was taught
to abandon her sexual desires

19:02.224 --> 19:03.725
and what she needs,

19:03.809 --> 19:08.814
but now she has to rediscover all of that
if she wants to find a relationship.

19:08.897 --> 19:11.525
Yesterday, I saw a list on your computer.

19:11.608 --> 19:13.360
[laughs] You saw my list?

19:13.443 --> 19:15.320
-I did see a list.
-[Alison] Yeah.

19:15.404 --> 19:18.907
And that list had a lot of type-A

19:18.991 --> 19:21.910
"I must have this, must have this,
must have this in a relationship."

19:21.994 --> 19:24.663
Preferences.
Maybe not must-haves. Preferences.

19:25.247 --> 19:27.249
Those are some strong preferences, girl!

19:27.332 --> 19:31.295
-There's, like, 50 of 'em or something.
-There was, like, 50 strong preferences!

19:31.378 --> 19:35.549
I'm so nervous about getting caught up
in emotions, feelings.

19:35.632 --> 19:38.468
It's like, "The minute
that I have to start feeling,

19:38.969 --> 19:40.137
I get uncomfortable,

19:40.220 --> 19:44.558
so I control
and put into categories and lists."

19:44.641 --> 19:47.811
The problem is, is that
when it's a spreadsheet like you had,

19:47.895 --> 19:52.316
instead of building healthy boundaries,
you're building walls.

19:53.358 --> 19:56.945
And you're not getting the connections
you truly deserve.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.115
It's hard to hear all those things.

20:00.782 --> 20:05.537
You need things to be written down
so you can have that clarity,

20:05.621 --> 20:09.416
which is why I brought this
because we need to redo that list.

20:09.499 --> 20:10.500
Okay.

20:10.584 --> 20:14.755
Wants, not wants, and boundaries.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.216
-That's all I get, just three?
-Mm-hmm.

20:17.299 --> 20:18.383
Okay!

20:18.467 --> 20:19.968
What is it that you want?

20:20.469 --> 20:22.304
-I think common interests.
-Okay.

20:22.387 --> 20:24.181
-A commitment to social justice.
-Okay.

20:24.264 --> 20:26.058
Now I'm gonna challenge you here.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.393
What's the level of social justice?

20:28.477 --> 20:31.688
Do they need to be at a 10%?
Is there a 15%?

20:31.772 --> 20:35.192
Because what you do
and how active you are,

20:35.275 --> 20:38.278
that takes your pool from a million to…

20:38.362 --> 20:39.613
-[clicks teeth]
-Mm-hmm.

20:39.696 --> 20:42.741
That's okay, if you're really like,
"They have to do these things."

20:42.824 --> 20:46.453
No, they don't have to do those things,
but, like, maybe it's just supporting me

20:46.536 --> 20:48.288
in my social-justice work.

20:48.372 --> 20:50.874
-Maybe it's just like support.
-Boom!

20:50.958 --> 20:54.211
Listen, that's so beautiful.
What else is a want for you?

20:55.254 --> 20:59.049
I mean, I think there has to be
some level of chemistry, like a spark.

20:59.132 --> 21:01.260
Chemistry and spark,
you know from off the bat.

21:01.343 --> 21:03.845
I think the want, in this case,

21:04.388 --> 21:08.517
is the courage to be able
to clearly say there is a spark.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.061
-Mm-hmm.
-What are the things that we don't want?

21:11.144 --> 21:13.063
Some people really just aren't available.

21:13.146 --> 21:16.108
They think they are, but they're really
not emotionally available.

21:16.191 --> 21:19.569
That's actually more of a want.
Emotionally available.

21:19.653 --> 21:21.071
Emo… Yeah. Yeah.

21:21.154 --> 21:24.074
[Karamo] These all coincide.
The want and the not want.

21:24.157 --> 21:26.368
[Alison] Yeah, it's like there's
an opposite of those.

21:26.451 --> 21:28.412
[Karamo] Exactly.
Now let's get those boundaries.

21:28.495 --> 21:32.040
What are the things
that are like, "Nope, this is not okay."

21:32.124 --> 21:35.585
I mean, I think respect is a big one.
Like, if there's not respect.

21:35.669 --> 21:37.212
-[Karamo] Yes.
-[Alison] You know?

21:37.713 --> 21:41.091
Where does, like, commitment
to personal growth go?

21:41.174 --> 21:43.719
"You doing the same thing
you were doing five years ago,

21:43.802 --> 21:45.637
and I don't want it." That's a boundary.

21:45.721 --> 21:46.555
[Alison] A boundary.

21:46.638 --> 21:49.933
All these things connect.
It's just making a shorter list.

21:50.017 --> 21:51.810
It's such clear communication.

21:51.893 --> 21:54.146
Then you start to really understand

21:54.229 --> 21:56.857
and not get boggled down in the analytics

21:56.940 --> 21:58.483
and the checking lists

21:58.567 --> 22:00.110
that then becomes a wall.

22:00.193 --> 22:01.445
Yeah. Yeah.

22:01.528 --> 22:05.115
If you're trying to meet somebody,
having a long checklist is not the way.

22:05.198 --> 22:08.744
What I wanna so is start that process off
where you can practice.

22:08.827 --> 22:10.912
Because all you're doing
is saying to yourself

22:10.996 --> 22:13.707
that "No one is ever gonna be
perfect enough for me."

22:13.790 --> 22:19.379
I propose that you allow me
to introduce you to five people.

22:19.463 --> 22:20.839
-Five people?
-Mm-hmm.

22:20.922 --> 22:23.175
Every time you meet with someone
in the Fab Five,

22:23.258 --> 22:25.969
at the end of your lesson,
you'll meet someone new.

22:26.053 --> 22:27.929
No pressure. Just a meet,

22:28.013 --> 22:32.142
where you can practice you clarifying,
"This is what I need."

22:32.225 --> 22:34.895
And at the end of the week,
if you like somebody,

22:34.978 --> 22:38.273
we circle back around
and say, "Maybe I go on a date."

22:39.608 --> 22:40.692
Uh, o… okay.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.903
-Does that work?
-That'd be awesome. That'd be awesome.

22:42.986 --> 22:44.988
[upbeat music playing]

22:47.491 --> 22:49.368
[Karamo]
I want you to meet my friend Pablo.

22:49.451 --> 22:50.285
-Hey, Pablo.
-Hi.

22:50.369 --> 22:51.953
-I'm Alison.
-[Pablo] Nice to meet you.

22:52.037 --> 22:53.497
Nice to meet you. [chuckles]

22:53.580 --> 22:55.123
[Karamo] Yeah, get comfortable.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.668
-This is a dope little tea spot.
-[Pablo] I'm really happy to be here.

22:58.752 --> 23:00.921
[Karamo] It's okay to know what you want

23:01.004 --> 23:03.965
and also to understand the boundaries
of things that are not acceptable.

23:04.049 --> 23:06.259
My friend here, he's active in sports.

23:06.343 --> 23:08.220
Active in support, what do you mean?

23:08.303 --> 23:10.138
-[Karamo] In sports.
-Oh, active in sports.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.848
[Pablo] I play soccer on Sunday mornings.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.476
But allow yourself to live in a space

23:14.559 --> 23:17.396
where things can change
and people can surprise you.

23:17.979 --> 23:20.148
It's all a big mystery. [laughs]

23:20.232 --> 23:22.067
I just go along for the ride.

23:22.150 --> 23:25.070
Which I love! I love that!

23:25.153 --> 23:26.696
[Alison] I'm not in control!

23:27.364 --> 23:29.366
[upbeat music playing]

23:34.454 --> 23:38.083
[Tan] Okay, so I brought you to Joseph,
which I love very much.

23:38.708 --> 23:40.502
[Alison] Mmm, I'm very uncomfortable.

23:40.585 --> 23:43.255
Everything looks really, really…
probably expensive.

23:43.839 --> 23:47.342
It's not things I would wear really.

23:47.426 --> 23:49.219
There's no flat shoes. [laughs]

23:49.302 --> 23:51.847
There are a couple of flat shoes.
There are a couple.

23:51.930 --> 23:54.558
Alison isn't comfortable here,

23:54.641 --> 23:56.101
but I want her to understand

23:56.184 --> 23:58.937
that the way she's going
to start to feel more comfortable

23:59.020 --> 24:00.772
on dates or in social settings

24:00.856 --> 24:02.858
is if she presents herself well.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.860
So I want to play with fit.

24:04.943 --> 24:06.736
I wanna play with color.

24:06.820 --> 24:10.240
I want to play with who she gets to be
going forward.

24:10.323 --> 24:13.160
For a long time, you haven't really had
a chance to experiment,

24:13.243 --> 24:16.413
and what you have in your closet
isn't going to push you at all.

24:16.496 --> 24:19.040
-You have twos of everything.
-You called it Noah's Ark.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.710
You had a Noah's Ark closet.
They all came in twos.

24:21.793 --> 24:23.753
-I've been laughing about that a lot.
-[Tan] Good!

24:23.837 --> 24:26.047
Like, in bed at night,
thinking, "Tan's right."

24:26.131 --> 24:28.300
Even if you continue
to get two of everything,

24:28.383 --> 24:30.719
doesn't bother me
as long as they make you feel something,

24:30.802 --> 24:33.513
not just,
"I'm putting clothes on my body."

24:33.597 --> 24:35.765
So I'm gonna take you to a mirror.

24:36.600 --> 24:39.019
Talk to me about the parts of your body
that you like.

24:39.519 --> 24:40.687
Um…

24:41.813 --> 24:43.231
I don't really think about it.

24:43.315 --> 24:44.816
-I feel like--
-That's not true.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.152
Yeah. I mean, it's not true, and it is,

24:47.235 --> 24:51.031
'cause, as sisters, we were almost meant
to feel like we didn't have a body.

24:51.114 --> 24:52.449
Desexualized.

24:52.532 --> 24:55.827
And you're not of this earth, you know.
You're in the world, but not of the world.

24:55.911 --> 24:57.037
But now that you're out,

24:57.120 --> 24:59.331
you can't say
you've not looked in the mirror

24:59.414 --> 25:02.250
and thought, "I wanna show this,
but I don't wanna show this."

25:02.334 --> 25:05.170
So what makes you uncomfortable
about your body?

25:05.879 --> 25:09.299
I feel like I have broad shoulders
and broad chest.

25:09.382 --> 25:11.676
-Okay.
-And so I always feel, like, top-heavy.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.386
I mean, I like to wear a cardigan.

25:13.470 --> 25:17.098
I like to cover things up
so I don't feel so top-heavy.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.601
Would you try on anything for me, please?

25:20.185 --> 25:21.019
"Anything"?

25:21.102 --> 25:24.606
I just want you to see that the things
that you see are all in your mind.

25:24.689 --> 25:26.566
No one's thinking that.

25:26.650 --> 25:28.151
I was raised in a very religious…

25:28.235 --> 25:31.404
I'm Muslim, which… We're a little
more extreme than most religions.

25:31.488 --> 25:34.032
And so I'm not the most sexual person.

25:34.115 --> 25:38.203
I chose somebody to marry
who was very, very Christian,

25:38.286 --> 25:41.748
who also didn't expect just sex
on the first date.

25:41.831 --> 25:44.167
Like, it takes a long time to get to that.

25:44.251 --> 25:47.587
However, I still wanted to be desired.

25:47.671 --> 25:49.714
Don't you want that at least?

25:49.798 --> 25:51.591
A little of that might be nice.

25:51.675 --> 25:53.426
And you don't do well on dates.

25:53.510 --> 25:55.887
I think you said
you don't feel comfortable on dates.

25:55.971 --> 25:58.265
Do you think
that that might change slightly

25:58.348 --> 26:01.977
if you really felt good about
how you presented yourself on those dates?

26:02.060 --> 26:03.061
-Maybe.
-Great.

26:03.144 --> 26:06.147
It'd be great to have, like, an outfit.
Yeah.

26:06.648 --> 26:08.066
[laughs]

26:08.149 --> 26:09.150
Who are you?

26:09.734 --> 26:11.987
Where were you when I came to your house?

26:12.070 --> 26:12.988
That's all I want.

26:13.071 --> 26:15.115
[upbeat music playing]

26:16.950 --> 26:18.118
Alison?

26:18.618 --> 26:20.203
[laughing]

26:20.287 --> 26:22.205
[Tan] Come on out! Let me see!

26:22.289 --> 26:25.041
Okay. Will you stand here for me
and look at yourself?

26:25.125 --> 26:26.084
Uh-huh.

26:26.167 --> 26:27.377
Oh my. [laughs]

26:28.628 --> 26:30.046
Your legs look amazing

26:30.630 --> 26:32.507
and very long.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.759
The shoe is gorgeous on you.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.553
But I wanna know what you think.

26:37.304 --> 26:38.638
Feels loud.

26:38.722 --> 26:40.265
Feels attention drawing.

26:40.348 --> 26:42.851
-Can I take out your, uh, clip?
-Um…

26:42.934 --> 26:45.520
-I just want… Do you mind?
-Yeah. Yeah, you can take it out.

26:45.604 --> 26:46.771
[laughs]

26:48.148 --> 26:50.150
I just wanna see.

26:50.900 --> 26:52.485
And then that on a date.

26:52.569 --> 26:56.448
Does it feel like a version
that could potentially be you?

26:56.531 --> 26:57.907
For your not-work life.

26:57.991 --> 27:00.493
Yeah, maybe with some time.
I like this color

27:00.577 --> 27:03.705
'cause it's similar
to the orange rust color I like to wear.

27:03.788 --> 27:04.914
-I know.
-[Alison] So I do…

27:04.998 --> 27:08.084
I'm usually not a pinky kind of person,
but yeah.

27:08.168 --> 27:10.420
I think you look beautiful, Alison.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.922
-Ready for the next one?
-Um, sure.

27:15.300 --> 27:16.801
-I'm gonna give you this.
-A bag?

27:16.885 --> 27:17.719
[Tan] Yeah.

27:17.802 --> 27:19.179
Stand right here, please.

27:22.182 --> 27:23.975
[Alison]
It feels like I have no bottoms on.

27:24.059 --> 27:27.479
-[laughs] You don't!
-[Alison laughs] I don't! Um…

27:27.562 --> 27:30.231
It's cute. I would never ever wear
anything like this.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.233
[Tan] I know you wouldn't.
I wanted to push you.

27:32.317 --> 27:33.151
Yeah.

27:33.234 --> 27:37.530
-We are sharing the tiniest bit of cleave.
-[Alison] Yeah.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.157
Let me take that bag from you.

27:39.240 --> 27:42.702
And now look
at what that's doing to your chest.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.580
I'd suggest always a scoop neck.
It doesn't have to be this low.

27:45.664 --> 27:48.375
Just something
that really shows off some skin

27:48.458 --> 27:50.710
so you start to see the extension
of a neck,

27:50.794 --> 27:53.797
otherwise you will always feel
the way you do about your chest.

27:53.880 --> 27:57.801
You know, the sleeves, the texture,
the belt, makes it so much small…

27:57.884 --> 27:59.094
Like it really…

27:59.678 --> 28:01.054
Yeah, it's like magic.

28:01.137 --> 28:05.350
I wanted you to see that the thing
that was in your head about your body

28:05.433 --> 28:07.560
was purely because
of how you were dressing it.

28:07.644 --> 28:09.312
-Yeah.
-Your body is balanced.

28:09.396 --> 28:12.691
It's like you…
Yeah, you make magic happen. [laughs]

28:12.774 --> 28:14.109
Thanks!

28:14.192 --> 28:17.404
-[Tan] And I have legs!
-You ha… Listen, you always had legs.

28:17.487 --> 28:20.615
You just weren't showing 'em off.
They are great legs.

28:20.699 --> 28:24.661
Now she can see what great clothes can do
for her body and her self-esteem.

28:25.245 --> 28:27.706
I think,
within a few days of wearing stuff

28:27.789 --> 28:31.292
that really enhance all the parts
of your body that you want to enhance,

28:31.376 --> 28:34.462
I think you'll start
to really feel so much better,

28:34.546 --> 28:36.589
and so much more comfortable on dates.

28:36.673 --> 28:38.591
How do you do with chitchat?

28:38.675 --> 28:41.219
I can talk to a lamppost.
I can make friends with a tree.

28:41.302 --> 28:42.470
I can talk to anyone.

28:42.554 --> 28:45.140
-Well, then I'm gonna put it to the test.
-Okay.

28:46.474 --> 28:48.518
[Tan] Alison, this is my new friend Paige.

28:48.601 --> 28:50.103
Nice to meet you.

28:50.186 --> 28:54.315
Alison is 40 years old and a former nun.

28:54.399 --> 28:56.401
I'm trying to get comfortable in things.

28:56.484 --> 28:58.903
I usually wear
the same kinda thing all the time.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.698
-[Paige] You buy it in several colors?
-That's exactly what I do.

29:01.781 --> 29:03.825
Can't lie.
Like, I have this dress in teal too.

29:03.908 --> 29:05.660
[Tan] But she can connect with anyone

29:05.744 --> 29:09.080
as long she presents herself
with confidence and shares her own joy.

29:09.164 --> 29:11.416
[Alison] I've never shown this much leg,
I don't think.

29:11.499 --> 29:12.542
-You look cute!
-Thanks!

29:12.625 --> 29:15.879
Because that could potentially lead
to a date.

29:15.962 --> 29:17.672
You've never been to a drag show?

29:17.756 --> 29:20.175
When I first came out of the convent,
we went to…

29:20.258 --> 29:23.303
I think it was a Halloween party,
and they did have some drag,

29:23.386 --> 29:25.680
but I've never been
to, like, drag show only.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.933
Well, Sunday, I'm not hard to find,
'cause I'm usually at one, so…

29:29.017 --> 29:30.435
[Alison] Awesome. That could be fun!

29:30.518 --> 29:31.644

29:40.236 --> 29:43.156
I wanted to bring you somewhere that
I didn't know what I was doing either.

29:43.239 --> 29:46.075
You and I are gonna learn together.
We're gonna throw a pot!

29:46.159 --> 29:47.911
Alison is such an amazing activist,

29:47.994 --> 29:50.330
but I think
she is also a creature of habit

29:50.413 --> 29:51.623
and she's set in her ways.

29:51.706 --> 29:53.792
Let me see them instructions. [laughs]

29:54.375 --> 29:57.337
Old-school nuns would say, "You keep
the rule, and the rule will keep you,"

29:57.420 --> 29:59.923
meaning you follow the rules,
and you get to stay in.

30:00.006 --> 30:03.968
I want her to let go a little bit
and just open up more emotionally

30:04.052 --> 30:06.346
and see that it's okay
to learn new things.

30:06.429 --> 30:09.891
It's okay to try new things.
It's okay to make yourself vulnerable.

30:09.974 --> 30:12.060
[Alison] It's hard learning new things.

30:12.143 --> 30:13.728
[groans] Oh.

30:13.812 --> 30:16.105
This is a lot harder than… [laughs]

30:16.189 --> 30:20.527
[Bobby] Because she definitely thinks
she knows how she wants things

30:20.610 --> 30:22.779
and has a plan and has a label.

-Look, I made a pitcher. [laughs]
-You made the Holy Grail!

30:26.282 --> 30:27.909
I still have a blob. [laughs]

30:27.992 --> 30:32.455
[Bobby] But I want Alison to realize
you can't control everything.

30:32.539 --> 30:35.875
[Alison] Oh no, she's sliding again.

30:35.959 --> 30:37.502
Oh, my sponge flew off.

30:37.585 --> 30:39.462
I think I'm gonna start over. Yeah.

[Bobby] As you know, Karamo has set up
some meet-and-greets,

30:47.554 --> 30:52.517
and he's got another one
that's meeting us here,

30:52.600 --> 30:55.395
and I'm gonna let you teach them.

30:55.478 --> 30:57.313
I'm not feeling confident in this.

30:57.397 --> 31:00.233
I feel that I haven't seen
this side of you before.

31:00.316 --> 31:01.860
I haven't either! [laughs]

31:04.320 --> 31:05.196
[Gary] This looks fun.

31:05.280 --> 31:07.407
-[Alison] Have you ever made pottery?
-I have not.

31:07.907 --> 31:09.909
-[Bobby] Gary was in the service.
-[Alison] Okay.

31:09.993 --> 31:11.703
So he's all about service, like you are.

31:11.786 --> 31:13.454
-What branch of the military?
-[Gary] Army.

31:13.538 --> 31:15.790
My nephew, he just joined the Marines.

31:15.874 --> 31:18.042
[Bobby] Alison is very good
with organizing

31:18.126 --> 31:20.295
and putting everything in little boxes,

31:20.378 --> 31:24.883
but, after 14 years of being a nun
and two years of a pandemic,

31:24.966 --> 31:27.135
this is no-pressure fun.

31:27.218 --> 31:30.096
Just, "Hey, let's hang out
with somebody new."

31:30.179 --> 31:31.931
[Alison]
What were you doing in the military?

31:32.015 --> 31:35.685
I was an artilleryman originally,
and then I became an intelligence officer.

31:35.768 --> 31:36.603
[Alison] Okay.

31:36.686 --> 31:41.274
What do you think some of the biggest
challenges have been, just big picture?

31:41.357 --> 31:43.818
-Dating at, like, our age?
-Yeah.

31:44.694 --> 31:45.778
I would say it's just…

31:45.862 --> 31:49.032
You know, you have to allow yourself
to be vulnerable because…

31:49.115 --> 31:50.575
-To open up?
-Yeah, to open up.

31:50.658 --> 31:51.743
[Alison] And share.

31:51.826 --> 31:54.746
[Bobby] You have to be present
and in the moment,

31:54.829 --> 31:56.956
and that goes for meeting people too.

31:57.040 --> 32:00.168
If you feel a little spark, great!

32:00.251 --> 32:02.337
Maybe go on a real date later on.

32:02.420 --> 32:04.589
-Oh my God. Look at you.
-[Alison] Well, I don't know.

32:04.672 --> 32:08.092
-It's not what it's supposed be.
-I feel like I'm way behind at this point.

32:08.176 --> 32:10.094
-[Bobby] It has potential.
-[Gary laughs]

32:10.178 --> 32:11.596
This is going great.

32:12.096 --> 32:13.598
[Alison laughs]

32:15.350 --> 32:17.352
[upbeat piano music playing]

32:24.442 --> 32:27.070
-[Antoni] Just me and you.
-[Alison] This is gonna be a disaster!

32:27.153 --> 32:28.112
[laughing]

32:28.196 --> 32:30.031
Oh my gosh. I've never even…

32:30.114 --> 32:32.617
-You've never been behind a bar before?
-Of course not!

32:32.700 --> 32:34.953
Being back here, it reminds me of…

32:35.036 --> 32:38.164
So I worked as a waiter and a bartender.

32:38.247 --> 32:41.876
This was my life
for the entirety of my 20s,

32:41.960 --> 32:43.753
was, like, serving drinks.

32:43.836 --> 32:46.506
I love mixology,
but I'm really excited to do it with you.

32:46.589 --> 32:48.716
So welcome to Vessel.

32:51.427 --> 32:52.804
I wanted to bring you here

32:52.887 --> 32:56.182
because, um, you were telling me
earlier this week

32:56.265 --> 32:58.768
that it was like
this pub crawl-y situation

32:58.851 --> 33:02.271
where you had to go to different bars,
and you were kind of intimidated.

33:02.355 --> 33:03.648
Personally, I'm allergic,

33:03.731 --> 33:06.192
and I learned later in life
that I was very allergic,

33:06.275 --> 33:10.613
but it's still something
that I love to include when I entertain.

33:10.697 --> 33:13.282
If you wanna loosen up
and you wanna have a little cocktail

33:13.366 --> 33:17.453
before, you know, a little rendezvous
or a date or social gathering with friends

33:17.537 --> 33:18.871
or whatever it is,

33:18.955 --> 33:21.374
then you know you at least have one drink
you can fall back on.

33:21.457 --> 33:22.542
Okay.

33:22.625 --> 33:25.753
I think Alison spends so much time
focusing on other people

33:25.837 --> 33:27.255
and helping her community,

33:27.338 --> 33:30.883
it's like a certain part of her has just
kind of remained in the background

33:30.967 --> 33:32.969
and has been suppressed, if you will,

33:33.052 --> 33:37.181
but it's like she's been given permission
to exercise this part of her

33:37.265 --> 33:40.101
that's been kind of brushed aside
for a really long time,

33:40.184 --> 33:41.602
and she's finding it now.

33:41.686 --> 33:44.814
I'm a Polish boy,
so let's go for classic vodka.

33:44.897 --> 33:49.110
My sister really loves vodka,
um, with orange juice.

33:49.193 --> 33:51.195
Vodka-cranberry is really popular as well.

33:51.279 --> 33:53.031
Do you like cranberry juice?

33:53.114 --> 33:55.324
Can you ever mix
the cranberry and orange juice?

33:55.408 --> 33:56.784
Totally! This is your drink.

33:56.868 --> 33:58.661
[Alison]
Well, I do a lot of juicing at home.

33:58.745 --> 34:00.079
-I have a juicer.
-[Antoni] Got it.

34:00.163 --> 34:02.081
[Alison] And I do a lot of…
Yeah, I love juicing

34:02.165 --> 34:05.460

I like making juices.

34:05.543 --> 34:08.921
-It's really pretty.
-It is pretty. It looks very tropical.

34:10.089 --> 34:12.258
Hmm. I like the flavors.

34:12.341 --> 34:13.885
And it's familiar to you.

34:13.968 --> 34:16.804
-Do you feel like we have a winner?
-I like this one the best.

34:16.888 --> 34:19.974
Vodka, cranberry, orange juice
with a wedge of lemon.

34:20.058 --> 34:22.727
There you go! We got it!
You have a drink now!

34:24.270 --> 34:27.398
I wanna know what you've learned
about yourself throughout the process.

34:27.482 --> 34:28.316
Uh…

34:29.233 --> 34:31.652
I'm like going so deep so quick.

34:31.736 --> 34:33.613
[Antoni] You feel like
you go so deep so quick?

34:33.696 --> 34:36.574
Yeah. Yeah.
It's something I need to work on. [laughs]

34:36.657 --> 34:40.119
I mean, I think
that's such a beautiful quality,

34:40.203 --> 34:43.539
and I think that
there's also a time and a place for it.

34:43.623 --> 34:46.292
You know what I mean?
If you, like, lead with that, it can--

34:46.375 --> 34:50.421
-Like, "Hey, ever been to death row?"
-Exactly. Like, that's a little…

34:50.505 --> 34:53.299
I mean, it's a hell of an icebreaker,
you know?

34:53.382 --> 34:55.510
It's really about the long game
with dating.

34:55.593 --> 34:58.596
You won't figure it out immediately.
You're gonna make a lot of mistakes.

34:58.679 --> 35:01.808
Speaking of meeting people, I have
a friend I was hoping you can meet.

35:01.891 --> 35:03.768
-Are you down?
-[Alison] I'm down for that.

35:03.851 --> 35:04.685
Yeah!

35:06.395 --> 35:08.648
[Antoni] I'm gonna be
your bartender today.

35:08.731 --> 35:11.025
-[Alison] Where are you from?
-Born and raised here.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.610
What kind of things are you into?

35:12.693 --> 35:14.112
Well, I'm a hairstylist.

35:14.195 --> 35:15.279
-Oh!
-[Ebony] Yes.

35:15.363 --> 35:16.823
-[Alison] Great hair.
-Thank you.

35:16.906 --> 35:22.036
I think with Alison, she's started to shed
all of these barriers and these layers.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.539
-So what about you?
-[Alison] I'm doing some writing.

35:24.622 --> 35:27.500
I do a lot, like, social-justice work
in the community.

35:27.583 --> 35:28.960
Is that what you're writing about?

35:29.043 --> 35:32.672
-Um, I was also a Catholic Sister before.
-Okay, good.

35:32.755 --> 35:34.590
So your faith it is important to you.

35:34.674 --> 35:35.633
-Awesome.
-Yeah.

35:35.716 --> 35:38.302
[Antoni] And that makes her
so much more interesting of a person.

35:38.386 --> 35:39.554
It's authenticity.

35:39.637 --> 35:41.722
-But I'm open, so…
-[Ebony] Yeah.

35:41.806 --> 35:45.810
I wouldn't say I'm super religious,
but I do believe in treating people well.

35:45.893 --> 35:47.687
The energy we put out into the world…

35:47.770 --> 35:49.939
-[Ebony] Absolutely.
-It's important. Yeah.

35:50.022 --> 35:53.109
Not that this is a competition,
but I do feel like she'll pick Ebony

she's had on people's lives.

restorative justice, conflict resolution.

about what you get to do?

where people can work together

You deserve
to celebrate yourself sometimes.

[Jonathan] Doesn't have to be on my level

'cause I see that I'm
on the very other end of the spectrum.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.516

I just feel like that smile on you,
honey, is, oh so pretty!

40:16.872 --> 40:20.835
So I'm just like, do we need
to put a little, like, color on there?

40:20.918 --> 40:22.253
You can try that.

40:22.336 --> 40:27.425

a shockingly unique week for you.

I've grown a lot this week,
and you really pushed me.

46:10.017 --> 46:13.270
Like, each of you really, really pushed me
and made me uncomfortable

46:13.353 --> 46:16.064
and, like, helped me grow
through that discomfort.

46:16.148 --> 46:18.442
[Karamo] When we first walked in,
you were like,

46:18.525 --> 46:21.403
"This is what it's gonna be.
This is how I'm gonna label it,"

46:21.487 --> 46:23.572
and then you just let your guard down.

46:23.655 --> 46:25.783
You helped me, like,
notice my feelings more.

46:25.866 --> 46:30.037
I can be analytical, and that's good
for a lot of the work I do,

46:30.120 --> 46:32.790
but I can't bring that
in, like, my personal relationships.

46:32.873 --> 46:35.125
-Amen. Love that.
-You gave me some good language.

46:35.209 --> 46:36.335

and comfortable.

46:40.672 --> 46:41.799

"Oh, okay. I could go
for a drink with that person?"

46:55.395 --> 46:57.940
-And this is not the pressure of a date.
-Yeah. No.

-It's just…
-Just a hangout.

48:53.847 --> 48:55.724
Who is it? I'm dying!

48:56.558 --> 48:59.269
♪ Dun, dun, da, da, da, da ♪

49:06.652 --> 49:07.945
[Tan] Oh!

49:08.028 --> 49:09.863
-It's my girl, Paige!
-[Karamo] She's beautiful.

49:09.947 --> 49:10.948
-Paige!
-I knew it!

49:11.031 --> 49:12.491
-[Paige] Hey,
-Hi, Paige.

49:12.574 --> 49:16.203
How are you? Good to see you again.
Thanks for coming.

49:16.286 --> 49:18.747
I gave her those highlights for nothing!

49:18.830 --> 49:19.915
[laughs]

49:19.998 --> 49:22.793
-Look at you in pants.
-I'm getting used to wearing pants.

49:22.876 --> 49:23.961
[Antoni] Paige is cute.

49:24.044 --> 49:25.545
-Paige is really cute.
-Yeah.

49:25.629 --> 49:27.255
-I like the tattoos.
-Me too.

49:27.339 --> 49:29.925
She really seemed to like Alison.
She seemed respectful.

49:30.008 --> 49:32.094
So how was… So how was drag day?

49:32.177 --> 49:34.638
-It was good. I had a lot of fun.
-Uh-huh.

49:34.721 --> 49:36.306
-Yeah.
-Thank you very much.|

49:36.390 --> 49:37.975
[waiter] What would you like to drink?

49:38.058 --> 49:42.938
Can you do a orange juice and cranberry
with vodka?

49:43.021 --> 49:45.107
-Yeah, sure. Of course.
-Yes!

49:45.190 --> 49:46.817
You look great. Cute dress.

49:46.900 --> 49:49.403
I normally am, like, denim and a T-shirt.

49:49.486 --> 49:50.946
-And you're good to go.
-Yeah.

49:51.029 --> 49:54.533
The way they're smiling at each other,
the way Alison is engaging, is lovely.

49:54.616 --> 49:56.702
-She seems open.
-[Karamo] Yeah, she seems very open.

49:56.785 --> 49:59.204
The fact that she's now
just letting someone be

49:59.287 --> 50:01.790
and not expecting them
to meet all these things,

50:01.873 --> 50:03.834
that's why she's open
to having a good time.

50:03.917 --> 50:07.129
And wherever this goes, like,
as long as she's getting the reps in,

50:07.212 --> 50:08.964
I think that's incredibly important.

50:09.047 --> 50:10.882
-Yes.
-Good dates, bad dates, all of them.

50:10.966 --> 50:13.135
[Alison] I've grown a lot this week.

50:13.218 --> 50:14.553
Just, like letting go

50:14.636 --> 50:19.057
and just knowing that, like, I'm capable
of learning how to receive love

50:19.599 --> 50:21.727
in addition to always giving it.

50:21.810 --> 50:24.855
Everyone should feel worthy
of treating themselves well

50:24.938 --> 50:26.189
and loving themselves.

50:26.273 --> 50:29.359
I mean, the whole dating thing
is still all, like, really new to me.

50:29.443 --> 50:32.362
Do you need, like,
a welcome manual or anything?

50:32.446 --> 50:35.907
A welcome manual. That would be awesome!
Can you write a welcome manual for me?

50:35.991 --> 50:39.369
Do you need a sponsor?
I can assign a lesbian sponsor for you.

50:39.453 --> 50:42.914
[Alison] That would be awesome.
I will gladly take a manual.

50:42.998 --> 50:44.374
[laughs]

50:44.458 --> 50:46.168
The thing I hope most for Alison,

50:46.251 --> 50:48.503
as she starts this new chapter
in her life,

50:48.587 --> 50:52.382
is that she's present
and open to the moment.

50:52.466 --> 50:54.926
And to lead with her heart
and not just her mind.

50:55.010 --> 50:57.596
[Antoni] By putting her guard down,
whenever she meets somebody,

50:57.679 --> 51:00.849
whether it's romantic,
professional, personal,

51:00.932 --> 51:03.602
it allows you to just go in
and learn something about them.

51:03.685 --> 51:06.855
You might learn something about yourself
in the process as well.

51:06.938 --> 51:08.982
So, for all the Alisons of the world,

51:09.066 --> 51:12.944
I hope you take a beat
to restore your heart and soul.

51:13.028 --> 51:14.946
[Alison laughs] Cheers.

51:15.030 --> 51:20.077
-[Bobby] We're just little matchmakers.
-To being open to opportunity and love.

51:20.160 --> 51:21.328
To surviving rejection!

51:21.411 --> 51:22.954
[Bobby laughs]

51:23.038 --> 51:24.623
[Jonathan] To Peirce! Yes.

51:24.706 --> 51:26.208
[guys laugh]

51:26.291 --> 51:27.375
[Jonathan] To Peirce.

51:27.459 --> 51:29.461
[upbeat drum music playing]

51:34.174 --> 51:36.802
Welcome to the Sazerac House,

51:36.885 --> 51:39.054
home of the Sazerac cocktail,

51:39.137 --> 51:41.681
a New Orleans tradition since the 1800s.

51:42.182 --> 51:44.184
So you start with two rocks glasses.

51:44.768 --> 51:47.187
In the first glass, add ice

51:47.854 --> 51:49.689
and set aside to chill.

51:49.773 --> 51:50.774
In the second glass,

51:50.857 --> 51:54.277
add two to three dashes
of Peychaud's bitters

51:54.361 --> 51:58.073
to a crushed sugar cube
or one teaspoon of simple syrup.

52:02.536 --> 52:05.539
Add a jigger of Sazerac rye whiskey.

52:06.373 --> 52:07.374
Add some ice.

52:08.083 --> 52:09.292
And stir.

52:10.961 --> 52:14.339
In the chilled glass,
rinse with a splash of Herbsaint,

52:14.422 --> 52:17.843
or if you prefer,
you can use its cousin, absinthe.

52:19.302 --> 52:21.429
And, finally, end with a twist.

52:22.180 --> 52:25.100
The Sazerac, a New Orleans original.

52:25.976 --> 52:26.852
Santé.
