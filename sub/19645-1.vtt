00:48.708 --> 00:54.250
The things you need to know
about Charlene.

00:56.250 --> 01:00.875
Me and her have been thick as thieves
since we were nine.

01:00.917 --> 01:03.625
Since we met in third class.

01:04.625 --> 01:06.667
What to say about her?

01:07.458 --> 01:10.625
Charlene is loyal...

01:10.792 --> 01:14.708
And honest and a very good person.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.833
She's a kind of girl that,

01:17.125 --> 01:20.958
if you're friends with her,
she'll always have your back.

01:20.958 --> 01:25.333
Not just from when fights break out but
like with small things as well.

01:25.708 --> 01:30.125
I suppose what I'm trying to say is
that she's kind-hearted.

01:30.125 --> 01:31.583
As most of you's know already.

01:31.583 --> 01:33.292
Mary?

01:41.125 --> 01:43.917
- See ya.
- See ya, sweetheart.

01:45.333 --> 01:48.792
See ya, Mary.

02:11.375 --> 02:13.500
This train is serving
all stations to Drogheda,

02:13.500 --> 02:16.667
all stations to Drogheda.

02:31.208 --> 02:34.083
Fuck sake.

02:50.167 --> 02:52.375
Come on!

03:01.792 --> 03:03.542
About fuckin' time.

03:16.833 --> 03:18.583
We missed ya.

03:18.958 --> 03:20.583
Yeah, right.

03:20.583 --> 03:22.417
Ya know we did.

03:22.750 --> 03:24.583
What time is Charlene coming over?

03:24.583 --> 03:28.292
She said she's up to her eyes. She'll
see ya at the fitting in the morning.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.042
She hasn't seen me in six months.

03:31.042 --> 03:32.333
Be nice to her, Mary.

03:32.333 --> 03:36.042
She stood by ya this past while.
A lot of them didn't, all right?

03:37.292 --> 03:40.292
There's a picture of her dress on me phone.

03:46.458 --> 03:47.875
Who's the other bridesmaid?

03:47.875 --> 03:49.417
Leona.

03:49.417 --> 03:51.917
Like to see that fat cunt fit into a dress.

03:51.917 --> 03:53.542
She lost the weight.

03:53.583 --> 03:55.083
I'm sure she'll find it again.

03:55.083 --> 03:56.292
Mary!

03:56.292 --> 03:58.208
What, Mother?

03:58.208 --> 04:00.375
Just be nice, will ya?

04:07.542 --> 04:09.083
- Come on.

04:09.083 --> 04:11.667
Hello and welcome
to a special episode of Crossfire,

04:11.667 --> 04:14.542
where four well known personalities
must avoid getting...

04:14.542 --> 04:15.792
All right?

04:17.291 --> 04:20.541
There's a load of Polish after
movin' in next door.

05:00.250 --> 05:01.625
Hi, this is Charlene.

05:01.625 --> 05:02.875
Leave a message.

05:03.333 --> 05:05.292
- Hey, it's me.

05:05.292 --> 05:06.417
What's the story?

05:06.417 --> 05:08.542
Thought we were meant
to be going out tonight.

05:08.542 --> 05:11.708
If I have to spend my first night
of freedom in with me ma and nan,

05:11.708 --> 05:13.583
I'll actually poke me eyes out.

05:14.375 --> 05:15.917
So hurry up and get back to me.

05:17.333 --> 05:19.250
Bye!

06:04.250 --> 06:06.292
I was waitin' here for an hour last week.

06:06.750 --> 06:08.250
Fuck sake.

06:08.417 --> 06:10.750
Come on, let's take
it easy there, please.

06:13.083 --> 06:15.833
Maybe we should get a few cans,
head off somewhere else.

06:25.417 --> 06:27.000
What are you staring at, sweet cheeks?

06:27.000 --> 06:29.083
- Sorry, what?
- "Sorry, what"?

06:29.083 --> 06:30.542
I said, what are you staring at?

06:30.542 --> 06:32.208
Do you want your go or somethin'?

06:32.833 --> 06:35.333
I'll fuckin' slap the Day-Glo tits off her.

06:35.333 --> 06:36.583
Hound.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.542
All right and now we got the fuckin' rat.

06:39.542 --> 06:41.333
Mary, I'm gonna have to ask you
to step outside.

06:41.333 --> 06:42.458
I didn't do anything.

06:42.458 --> 06:44.292
- Don't even put your hands on me.
- Calm down.

06:44.333 --> 06:45.958
- I didn't do anything. What did I...
- Calm down.

06:45.958 --> 06:47.583
- Tell me what I did.
- You where hassling that girl.

06:47.583 --> 06:49.542
How could I hass...
She's the one staring at me out of it.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.125
- Pikin' me out of it.
- Will you just walk please?

06:51.125 --> 06:52.958
Oh, you's are fuckin' fools in here.

06:52.958 --> 06:54.667
You're after making a fuckin' show of me.

06:54.667 --> 06:55.875
I'll ask you to step outside.

06:55.875 --> 06:57.333
You know what, I'd advise yous all
to fuck off out of here.

06:57.333 --> 06:59.208
Run by cunts, absolute cunts.

06:59.208 --> 07:00.333
Don't mind her.

07:00.333 --> 07:02.125
All fuckin' knackers.

07:02.958 --> 07:04.917
Just go home, Mary.

07:19.542 --> 07:22.667
The things ya need to know
about Charlene.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.958
When me and her were in school,

07:26.333 --> 07:29.083
all the other girls
would have stayed away from us.

07:30.333 --> 07:32.542
This is cos they knew we were tough.

07:33.083 --> 07:36.250
And if they said anything smart
they were gonna get a slap.

07:40.583 --> 07:41.875
We didn't care though.

07:42.167 --> 07:44.833
Cos the only people we ever wanted
to hang out with was each other.

07:44.833 --> 07:45.917
Gorgeous.

07:45.917 --> 07:48.042
- Do you think the length is OK?
- Perfect for dancing...

07:48.042 --> 07:49.208
- Yeah?
- ...once you wear those shoes.

07:49.208 --> 07:50.958
- Are you definite on this?
- Mmm, I'm not sure.

07:50.958 --> 07:52.292
Well, there's actually a
bustle at the back

07:52.292 --> 07:53.333
- that you can hook up and...
- Alright,

07:53.333 --> 07:54.542
- Makes it easier for dancing.
- Great.

07:54.542 --> 07:56.667
- OK.
- Sorry, can I help you?

07:59.458 --> 08:00.708
Hey.

08:01.792 --> 08:03.042
Hey.

08:03.375 --> 08:04.875
Come here.

08:08.333 --> 08:09.583
Oh, careful.

08:10.208 --> 08:12.125
Em, this is Sally, the dressmaker.

08:12.125 --> 08:13.500
This is Mary, my maid of honour.

08:13.500 --> 08:15.917
- Hey, Mary.
- And you remember Leona, don't you?

08:16.208 --> 08:17.458
Yeah.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.500
Will you lift that up there for me?
Yeah.

08:23.500 --> 08:25.125
- That's perfect, Sally.
- OK.

08:25.667 --> 08:27.167
Isn't she gorgeous?

08:33.167 --> 08:34.707
What're you wearing?

08:35.707 --> 08:37.125
What are you wearing?

08:37.500 --> 08:38.875
What do you mean?

08:39.375 --> 08:41.457
It looks like a little tablecloth.

08:43.875 --> 08:45.125
Jesus, Mary.

08:45.375 --> 08:46.458
What?

08:46.458 --> 08:47.708
You smell of booze.

08:48.667 --> 08:50.917
Yeah, well, I thought we were meant
to go out last night.

08:50.917 --> 08:53.583
Yeah, sorry.
Just been a bit mad with all of this.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.000
Missed ya.

09:03.083 --> 09:04.500
Here, hold that.

09:06.750 --> 09:08.292
I got you this.

09:12.125 --> 09:14.208
- What's this for?
- You've to make a speech at the weddin',

09:14.208 --> 09:15.667
...and just with your accent.

09:17.083 --> 09:19.958
- I've the same accent as you.

09:21.542 --> 09:22.792
What're you laughin' at?

09:23.333 --> 09:24.375
Nothin'.

09:24.375 --> 09:27.292
Nothin' is right.
Laugh at me again and watch what happens.

09:28.333 --> 09:30.542
Excuse me, do you realise
you're actually the maid of honour?

09:30.542 --> 09:33.375
It is your duty to the bride
to turn up for fittings on time

09:33.375 --> 09:34.958
and to organise everyone on the day

09:34.958 --> 09:36.625
and show up with a nice fella
that matches your dress.

09:36.625 --> 09:37.750
What's that mean?

09:37.750 --> 09:38.875
Mary.

09:38.875 --> 09:41.000
I wouldn't worry about her
turnin' up with a fella, Sally.

09:41.000 --> 09:42.417
Chance'll be a fine thing.

09:42.458 --> 09:44.708
Think I can get a fella quicker
than you, Leona.

09:44.708 --> 09:45.792
And how'd you work that one out'?

09:45.792 --> 09:47.917
I've been with the same chap
the past five years.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.000
Who?

09:49.000 --> 09:50.583
Seamus McCrory.

09:51.750 --> 09:54.708
- Who?
- He was the year behind us in school.

09:54.708 --> 09:57.375
The little midget who used to do football
in his underpants, him?

09:57.375 --> 09:59.125
That was fuckin' years ago, Mary.

09:59.125 --> 10:00.208
People don't forget, Leona.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.292
Yeah, well, at least I
have a fuckin' boyfriend.

10:02.292 --> 10:04.458
I wouldn't touch him with yours.

10:05.042 --> 10:06.667
You're not even getting a plus one.

10:06.667 --> 10:08.708
Charlene has given it to Declan's cousin.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.375
Jesus Christ! You think we could
focus on me for a while now?

10:19.542 --> 10:21.292
Come here, what was it like?

10:24.875 --> 10:27.042
Would have been nice to hear from you.

10:27.833 --> 10:29.708
Said you didn't want visitors.

10:30.125 --> 10:31.542
You could have wrote, like.

10:32.208 --> 10:34.167
You should have told me, like...

10:40.458 --> 10:42.042
Where the fuck is he?

10:42.875 --> 10:44.875
Just text him and tell him
we're goin' drinkin'.

10:44.875 --> 10:47.250
- No.
- Please?

10:47.250 --> 10:48.875
- No!

10:49.167 --> 10:50.417
Why not?

10:51.375 --> 10:53.167
Cos the wedding is this day, three weeks,

10:53.167 --> 10:55.833
and I've fuckin' a hundred
and one things to be doin'.

10:59.333 --> 11:01.000
How come I didn't get a plus one?

11:01.542 --> 11:03.500
Cos the plates are like 60 quid.

11:04.208 --> 11:06.333
Everyone you know is gonna be there.

11:08.917 --> 11:10.208
What?

11:11.208 --> 11:12.500
Nothin'.

11:14.083 --> 11:15.333
Sap.

11:16.208 --> 11:17.917
- You're a sap.
- You're a sap.

11:19.375 --> 11:20.625
There he is now, look.

11:21.250 --> 11:22.958
Right, this is for you.

11:22.958 --> 11:25.125
Now, are you sure you're OK doin' all this?

11:25.375 --> 11:27.375
Cos I can get Leona to help if you want.

11:28.083 --> 11:29.333
Right, OK, cool?

11:29.833 --> 11:31.583
- Call you later, right?
- Yeah.

11:55.833 --> 11:57.958
So, basically,
if you punch in something wrong

11:57.958 --> 11:59.875
you just hit void and start again, OK?

11:59.958 --> 12:01.417
It's a piece of piss, really.

12:01.458 --> 12:03.750
Just ask Udel if you need
anything, all right?

12:06.458 --> 12:08.958
I'm on the same shift as you tomorrow.
So I'll see you then, yeah?

12:08.958 --> 12:10.208
OK.

12:11.375 --> 12:12.958
- Thanks.
- No bother.

12:20.708 --> 12:23.167
- Where are you from yourself'?
- Nigeria.

12:28.125 --> 12:29.583
Do you have a girlfriend?

12:30.833 --> 12:34.542
- I have a wife.
- Oh.

12:39.042 --> 12:41.583
I knew the first night I met Declan,

12:41.792 --> 12:43.542
that he was the one for Charlene.

12:43.667 --> 12:45.333
He was a kind-hearted bloke.

12:45.792 --> 12:47.125
And a nice man.

12:47.500 --> 12:50.833
Plus, he bought the two of us loads
of drinks, so that was cool.

12:51.042 --> 12:53.750
Char was always the confident one
with fellas.

12:53.875 --> 12:55.125
Whereas with me,

12:55.500 --> 12:57.000
I never really bothered that much

12:57.000 --> 13:00.042
cos I think most fellas from Drogheda
are all dopes.

13:00.375 --> 13:03.000
No offence, to any of ya's
here tonight, though.

13:05.792 --> 13:07.458
It's shit around here now.

13:07.833 --> 13:09.250
Everything's changed.

13:15.542 --> 13:17.042
You're still selling gear?

13:18.000 --> 13:19.250
Nah...

13:19.417 --> 13:20.833
I'm working as a postman.

13:22.958 --> 13:24.500
Your da set that up?

13:25.000 --> 13:26.542
Yeah. Nice one, da.

13:30.667 --> 13:32.583
Do you wanna go on a date sometime?

13:33.208 --> 13:34.500
What?

13:34.792 --> 13:36.125
A date.

13:36.792 --> 13:38.125
Why?

13:39.125 --> 13:40.375
I don't know.

13:41.167 --> 13:42.750
We never did that.

13:43.833 --> 13:46.833
- So?
- Maybe we should.

13:47.708 --> 13:49.875
- For the laugh.
- What are you on about?

13:51.333 --> 13:52.750
I suppose.

13:56.792 --> 13:59.583
Any interest in goin' to a weddin', no?

14:09.708 --> 14:11.208
I'll see ya around, yeah?

14:11.750 --> 14:13.042
Yeah.

14:19.417 --> 14:20.792
Dates.

14:25.125 --> 14:27.667
No matter how great life is,

14:27.667 --> 14:32.000
it's always better when you have
someone special to share it with.

14:32.000 --> 14:34.125
Here at Cupid's Arrow,

14:34.125 --> 14:37.333
we provide a unique personal
introduction service

14:37.333 --> 14:40.500
that is designed to help you
meet someone special.

14:40.792 --> 14:42.417
No more single ads.

14:42.542 --> 14:44.667
No more Tinder dates.

14:44.708 --> 14:47.083
So why not visit us today?

15:14.708 --> 15:16.208
Yeah.
Are you Jess?

15:16.375 --> 15:17.625
Yeah.

15:17.792 --> 15:19.417
I'm Charlene Duffy's maid of honour.

15:19.417 --> 15:21.833
I'm here to pay a deposit
for the weddin' video.

15:22.333 --> 15:25.333
Uh, any chance
you can come back in an hour?

15:25.333 --> 15:26.375
No.

15:34.250 --> 15:38.500
Hey. Um... Uh, come in.

15:45.000 --> 15:48.458
I actually thought this job was cancelled
when I never heard from her.

15:48.667 --> 15:49.917
Here, em.

15:50.000 --> 15:51.958
Where am I, again?

15:53.333 --> 15:54.833
Bewley Mews

15:57.500 --> 15:59.583
Uh, what's the... What's the date again?

15:59.917 --> 16:01.417
28th of March.

16:03.375 --> 16:04.833
Oh, shit.

16:05.333 --> 16:08.667
- What?
- I actually can't do it. I have a gig that night.

16:09.333 --> 16:10.583
What?

16:11.375 --> 16:13.208
I have a gig with my band.

16:13.958 --> 16:15.792
Well, can you not cancel that?

16:17.167 --> 16:18.333
No.

16:18.417 --> 16:19.667
Why not?

16:20.333 --> 16:22.875
Because I don't want to.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.083
It's fine. I have a number
here I can give you.

16:25.083 --> 16:26.583
No, she wanted you.

16:26.583 --> 16:28.917
I'm sure Charlene will get over it.

16:28.917 --> 16:31.000
No, she really won't.

16:35.750 --> 16:37.500
What do you want me to do?

16:41.167 --> 16:42.417
Fine.

16:42.417 --> 16:44.708
I will cancel my gig for you.

16:47.750 --> 16:49.083
Thanks.

16:49.833 --> 16:51.458
Bridezilla, huh?

16:52.333 --> 16:53.917
Mind your own business.

16:55.792 --> 16:57.125
What's, eh...

16:57.333 --> 16:58.792
What's her name, again?

16:59.750 --> 17:01.125
Jess.

17:07.583 --> 17:10.583
OK, you owe me.

17:10.791 --> 17:12.208
Oh, thank you.

17:12.458 --> 17:14.708
- Seriously, thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:14.708 --> 17:17.875
Eh, Jess, I'm gonna head on.
Do you want my digits?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.708
- Uh...
- He forgot your name a minute ago.

17:22.833 --> 17:24.125
No, I didn't.

17:24.291 --> 17:26.500
Yeah, you did.
You just asked me what her name was.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.542
Uh, it's fine.

17:29.708 --> 17:33.292
- I didn't want his number anyway.
- Bye.

17:39.542 --> 17:40.833
Well played.

17:41.083 --> 17:42.333
I have me moments.

17:43.542 --> 17:45.625
- The deposit.
- Oh, thank you.

17:47.792 --> 17:49.667
So I guess I'll see you on the 28th, then.

17:49.667 --> 17:51.083
Yeah.

17:57.625 --> 18:01.333
- You're a good egg.
- You, too.

18:03.333 --> 18:04.958
Door opening.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.750
"You're a good egg"?

18:07.083 --> 18:08.917
Fuckin' asshole.

18:10.000 --> 18:12.208
Door closing.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.375
Order for McArdle.

18:24.625 --> 18:26.125
Um, just a minute.

18:46.917 --> 18:48.500
Thanks.

18:53.375 --> 18:54.833
There's Mary.

18:55.542 --> 18:56.667
- Hey.
- Hey.

18:56.875 --> 18:58.250
- Hey, Mary.
- Hi.

18:59.292 --> 19:01.500
Do you wanna join us?
It's Leona's birthday.

19:01.833 --> 19:03.708
- No.
- All right

19:04.625 --> 19:05.958
Happy birthday.

19:06.250 --> 19:08.417
So I just came to say that I met a fella.

19:09.417 --> 19:11.958
So I might need that plus one after all.

19:12.292 --> 19:13.375
Oh!

19:13.375 --> 19:15.375
What do you mean "Oh"?
I'm not a fuckin' leper, Charlene.

19:15.375 --> 19:17.667
I know. Stop cursin' at me.

19:18.708 --> 19:21.125
- Sorry.

19:21.542 --> 19:23.500
So, who is he?

19:23.750 --> 19:26.292
- You don't know him.
- Yeah, well, what's his name?

19:26.917 --> 19:28.375
John.

19:29.125 --> 19:30.792
"John" what?

19:31.708 --> 19:32.958
Carter.

19:33.250 --> 19:35.125
From Mars?

19:35.875 --> 19:36.958
What?

19:36.958 --> 19:38.583
The film.

19:41.583 --> 19:43.708
So, can he come or not?

19:46.458 --> 19:48.917
Yeah. Course.

19:49.542 --> 19:50.875
Thank you.

19:51.250 --> 19:52.750
You're welcome.

19:58.250 --> 19:59.500
See you's.

19:59.583 --> 20:01.542
- See you, Mary.
- See you, Mary.

20:03.833 --> 20:05.958
John Carter? Seriously?

20:06.667 --> 20:08.292
She's fine.

20:15.333 --> 20:16.875
Hey, it's me.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.333
- Hiya.
- So, listen.

20:18.333 --> 20:21.583
I was thinking it could be good for us
to meet John Carter before the weddin'.

20:21.583 --> 20:22.833
Who?

20:23.500 --> 20:24.833
Your boyfriend.

20:25.125 --> 20:26.292
Oh, yeah.

20:26.292 --> 20:29.125
So why don't the two of you's come over
for a beer or somethin' on Saturday?

20:29.125 --> 20:30.833
You can see the new house as well.

20:33.208 --> 20:34.708
- He's workin'.
- Oh?

20:35.083 --> 20:36.333
What's he do?

20:36.417 --> 20:37.667
Works in a bar.

20:38.375 --> 20:39.625
Where?

20:41.000 --> 20:44.208
- McPhails?
- Mary, the barmen in there are really hot.

20:44.208 --> 20:45.625
Which one is he?

20:46.917 --> 20:48.708
The tall one with short hair.

20:48.833 --> 20:50.458
The one with all the tatts?

20:50.833 --> 20:52.125
No. No tatts.

20:52.500 --> 20:53.958
Look, you probably don't know him.

20:54.000 --> 20:55.583
He keeps to himself.

20:56.167 --> 20:57.958
Anyway, he's workin' Saturday.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.500
Shit.

20:59.667 --> 21:01.333
I could still come over.

21:02.292 --> 21:04.250
Ah no. You're all right.

21:04.542 --> 21:07.125
Come here, em...
He's not weird or anything, is he?

21:07.875 --> 21:10.458
- What?
- You know what I mean.

21:11.042 --> 21:12.708
No, he's not weird.

21:12.958 --> 21:14.083
Cool.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.583
It'd be good to meet him anyway.

21:15.583 --> 21:17.375
Maybe next week?

21:17.792 --> 21:19.125
Yeah. I'll say it to him.

21:19.333 --> 21:20.917
Thanks, babes.

21:29.792 --> 21:33.417
The things you need to know
about Charlene.

21:56.958 --> 21:59.292
What kind of man you want?

22:00.625 --> 22:03.917
One that's free to go to a weddin'
on the 28th of March.

22:05.833 --> 22:08.958
- That's it?
- Yeah.

22:09.458 --> 22:13.417
But what kind of men do you like?
I mean, Polish, Irish, what?

22:14.167 --> 22:16.875
- Any.
- Look, in the agency

22:16.875 --> 22:20.708
we have older men for older women, yeah?

22:22.333 --> 22:26.458
But I'll find you a nice boy, OK? Stand up.

22:26.708 --> 22:28.125
Photo.

22:33.167 --> 22:35.333
Now, ready? Smile.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.292
Mmm? A bit more.

22:39.083 --> 22:40.500
A bit more.

22:40.875 --> 22:42.875
- Ta-da!

22:45.083 --> 22:47.458
I'm giving you
the famous J-Lo glow.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.417
It's excitin', isn't it?

22:51.500 --> 22:52.750
No.

22:57.417 --> 22:58.750
Any advice?

22:59.208 --> 23:01.667
You're askin' her for advice?

23:01.667 --> 23:04.750
Yes, Mam. She's asking me for advice.

23:04.750 --> 23:06.667
I'm a woman. I've been taken out by men.

23:06.667 --> 23:08.958
A fuckin' sniper wouldn't take you out.

23:09.417 --> 23:12.542
I don't remember
gettin' any pearls of wisdom off you.

23:18.000 --> 23:19.750
You're done.

23:21.333 --> 23:24.083
- How do I look?
- Like a whore.

23:36.125 --> 23:39.167
I believe you're lookin' to find someone
to go to a wedding?

23:44.417 --> 23:47.750
Me and Char have known
our fair share of hard times.

23:49.000 --> 23:51.375
When Char's gran died, I was there for her.

23:51.542 --> 23:53.625
When stuff was goin' on for me,

23:53.792 --> 23:55.917
she was always there for me, too.

23:57.208 --> 24:01.125
As they say, “Hard times will always reveal
true friendship.“

24:01.208 --> 24:04.125
And ours is very true.

24:04.958 --> 24:07.167
- Ours is the most true.

24:07.167 --> 24:08.750
Ours is...

24:11.667 --> 24:13.208
Hi, this is Charlene.

24:13.333 --> 24:14.625
Leave a message.

24:15.917 --> 24:17.208
Hey, it's me.

24:17.667 --> 24:20.667
So I was readin' this really interesting
thing in the paper earlier.

24:20.667 --> 24:24.542
It said that the best night ever
to go out with Mary is a Tuesday night?

24:24.542 --> 24:26.208
So...

24:27.500 --> 24:29.083
Call me back.

24:30.917 --> 24:33.417
So, do you do
anything like that yourself?

24:34.917 --> 24:38.875
- What?
- Like sport or drama?

24:39.917 --> 24:41.542
No.

24:44.000 --> 24:45.583
Any interests at all?

24:48.167 --> 24:49.750
No.

25:11.000 --> 25:14.625
This is the first one of these where
I've actually had a good feelin'.

25:15.500 --> 25:18.250
You just seem to be really sound

25:18.417 --> 25:19.667
and funny.

25:19.792 --> 25:21.542
And you're proper hot.

25:22.917 --> 25:25.125
The fact that you need someone
to bring to your friend's weddin'

25:25.167 --> 25:28.000
and I need someone
to bring to my brother's weddin'...

25:28.792 --> 25:30.417
...it could be perfect.

25:35.917 --> 25:37.750
Oh, fuck me.

25:39.167 --> 25:42.333
You're my boyfriend, your name is John.

25:46.083 --> 25:47.292
I've got this.

25:47.292 --> 25:48.667
Hello!

25:48.667 --> 25:50.708
Hi, what are you doin' here?

25:50.708 --> 25:52.333
Oh, I was passing on me way from work.

25:52.333 --> 25:54.083
And who do we have here?

25:54.292 --> 25:57.375
Charlene, this is John Carter,
the chap I was tellin' you about.

25:57.375 --> 25:59.917
John, this is Charlene.

26:00.583 --> 26:02.958
I believe I'm comin' to your weddin'.

26:03.417 --> 26:04.958
Wow. He's cute.

26:04.958 --> 26:06.292
Thanks.

26:06.292 --> 26:08.542
Well, it was good to see ya, Char.

26:13.000 --> 26:15.292
He's fuckin' gorgeous, Mary.

26:15.292 --> 26:16.375
Yep.

26:24.625 --> 26:26.583
Can I ask you somethin'?

26:27.042 --> 26:30.750
This is gonna seem really weird
cos I just met you but...

26:32.208 --> 26:34.583
would you like to be a groomsman?

26:34.708 --> 26:38.542
It's just Declan, me fella, he doesn't
really have any good-lookin' friends,

26:38.542 --> 26:43.708
and it'd be deadly to have at least one
good-lookin' chap in the photographs.

26:43.708 --> 26:46.833
Er... Sure.

26:50.167 --> 26:51.958
You did well, hun.

26:52.542 --> 26:54.208
I sure did.

26:54.500 --> 26:58.583
By the way, the hen's is on Friday.
The theme is Mamma Mia!

26:58.833 --> 27:00.042
What's that mean?

27:00.042 --> 27:02.792
Ya come dressed as a
character from the film.

27:02.792 --> 27:04.875
What, like Meryl Streep?

27:04.875 --> 27:07.083
No. Leona got Meryl Streep.

27:07.333 --> 27:11.875
We put all the names in a hat
And you got Stellan Skarsgård.

27:12.417 --> 27:14.792
OK? See ya Friday.

27:21.042 --> 27:22.958
Looks like you're coming to a weddin'.

27:22.958 --> 27:24.417
Bring it on, chicken.

27:27.333 --> 27:29.792
You're gonna have to dial down the camp.

27:30.292 --> 27:31.917
Er, I'm not camp.

27:31.917 --> 27:34.042
Eh, yeah, ya are.

27:37.750 --> 27:38.958
What?

27:38.958 --> 27:40.958
I'm sorry. I'll... I'll go to
your brother's weddin'.

27:40.958 --> 27:43.042
Aw, fuck off!

27:57.417 --> 28:01.458
The things you need
to know about Charlene.

28:02.083 --> 28:05.458
Me and her share the
best memories together.

28:07.708 --> 28:09.333
Like the weekends.

28:09.542 --> 28:12.250
When the two of us would go clubbin'.

28:12.333 --> 28:15.208
This is when we'd really
get to let our hair down.

28:15.542 --> 28:20.417
Nights that felt like they
went on forever and ever.

28:20.417 --> 28:24.958
Like me and her were the only
two people left in the world.

28:28.625 --> 28:31.708
- Hey.
- I might head on.

28:31.917 --> 28:33.167
OK, then.

28:34.875 --> 28:37.583
Oh, you text me John Carter's
number in the morning?

28:37.583 --> 28:40.750
- Who?
- Your boyfriend.

28:40.750 --> 28:41.833
Oh.

28:41.833 --> 28:44.208
- What?
- Nothin'. I was just...

28:44.208 --> 28:45.583
...thinkin' of breakin' up with him.

28:46.792 --> 28:49.833
Jesus, Mary, do you not recognise
a good thing when it lands in your lap?

28:49.833 --> 28:52.125
Ya don't even know him.
He could be a fuckin' dick.

28:52.125 --> 28:53.458
Yeah, well, he's not.

28:53.708 --> 28:56.667
Oh, would you check your email cos
I sent ya your speech.

28:56.917 --> 28:58.750
I thought I was supposed to write it.

28:59.208 --> 29:01.458
Well, I did it for ya.

29:02.125 --> 29:03.458
Right?

30:32.375 --> 30:34.333
Nice outfit.

30:36.417 --> 30:39.333
- Weddin' video.
- Wedding video.

30:40.333 --> 30:41.458
How's it goin'?

30:41.458 --> 30:43.792
Good. So what are you up to?

30:45.500 --> 30:47.542

30:47.542 --> 30:49.500
Are you here with mates?

30:49.750 --> 30:51.042
Yeah.

30:55.375 --> 30:57.333
Sorry, I just have to...

31:15.458 --> 31:16.708
Hello?

31:19.042 --> 31:20.792
Fuck off.

31:23.417 --> 31:25.333
There's a queue out here!

31:26.958 --> 31:29.375

- There's people waiting...

31:29.375 --> 31:31.917

31:32.333 --> 31:34.083
Say that again.

31:35.167 --> 31:36.875

31:57.917 --> 32:01.875
You're after breaking
a glass in me fuckin' hand!

32:02.542 --> 32:05.792
Ya See that? Fuckin' lawsuit.

Did ya enjoy the show?

32:20.917 --> 32:22.708
What show?

32:26.083 --> 32:28.417
You do realise you're bleeding?

32:59.958 --> 33:01.792
You didn't have to come with me.

33:02.083 --> 33:03.667
I know.

33:04.833 --> 33:06.542
Good night?

33:06.833 --> 33:08.542
Hardly.

33:12.208 --> 33:14.083
You?

33:14.333 --> 33:16.333
It was OK.

33:19.292 --> 33:21.417
Actually it was kinda shit.

33:21.458 --> 33:25.875
I spent most of the night hiding from this
psycho I went on a date with a while back.

33:25.875 --> 33:28.208
- Hate that.
- Yeah.

33:31.708 --> 33:33.833
I've been on a few dates meself lately.

33:33.833 --> 33:35.250
Oh. yeah?

33:35.542 --> 33:38.208
- Lotta psychos.
- Yeah?

33:38.292 --> 33:39.917
Big time.

33:47.292 --> 33:51.458
I went on one there the other night
with this fella that used to be a priest.

33:51.458 --> 33:55.583
Never been with a woman before in his life.
He was like 34.

33:55.583 --> 33:56.833
And what happened?

33:57.083 --> 33:58.833
I left after the starter.

33:59.167 --> 34:02.208
You didn't really give
him much of a chance.

34:02.208 --> 34:03.583
He was a priest.

34:03.583 --> 34:06.625
Well, you've obviously got high standards.

34:06.917 --> 34:08.458
That's what me ma says.

34:08.708 --> 34:11.417
But I think that's just cos
she has no standards.

34:11.417 --> 34:13.000
When it comes to men.

34:13.208 --> 34:14.833
Your dad not around?

34:15.250 --> 34:17.833
Nah. He left when I was a kid.

34:19.083 --> 34:21.500
My dad died last year.

34:22.500 --> 34:24.125
Sorry.

34:26.667 --> 34:31.625
My mam just started dating again.
She's got like three guys on the go.

34:31.917 --> 34:34.917
You should give her a call.
She might give you some tips.

34:35.042 --> 34:36.292
Yeah, maybe I will.

34:38.208 --> 34:40.167
Mary McArdle?

34:41.667 --> 34:43.417
- Thanks for...
- No worries.

34:43.417 --> 34:44.500
I can wait if you like.

34:44.500 --> 34:46.792
Oh, no, you're all right.

34:48.125 --> 34:50.292
See ya around. Yeah?

35:18.917 --> 35:21.375
- All right?
- Yeah.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.542
What happened to your hand?

35:28.792 --> 35:30.417
Nothin'.

35:30.750 --> 35:32.583
It's grand.

35:35.583 --> 35:39.500
Did you see there's speed datin' in the
Westcourt on Friday night?

35:40.167 --> 35:42.167
The two of us could go together.

35:43.167 --> 35:44.875
Dream on.

35:52.750 --> 35:56.625
Your man Ollie that, drives the taxi for
Caffreys, dropped me home.

35:56.625 --> 35:58.875
Asked me out on a date.

36:01.667 --> 36:02.917
He's my age.

36:02.958 --> 36:04.417
I know!

36:04.667 --> 36:06.792
So what? I like him.

36:07.083 --> 36:08.625
You would.

36:19.333 --> 36:21.250
You want advice, Mary?

36:21.875 --> 36:26.958
Get off your high horse
or you'll end up a very lonely girl.

36:31.500 --> 36:33.792
And that one's for free.

36:49.750 --> 36:51.000
Fuck off!

36:59.708 --> 37:01.458
What can I get ya?

37:36.167 --> 37:37.750
All right?

38:04.250 --> 38:05.667
Jess!

38:06.542 --> 38:08.583
- Hey.
- Hey!

38:10.583 --> 38:15.917
I saw you from the bus so I, like,
I ran from, like, all the way back there...

38:15.917 --> 38:19.417
- No way!
- Yeah, past the lights.

38:22.542 --> 38:24.250
Right. I'll let you go.

38:24.292 --> 38:27.042
Oh, which way are you walkin'?

38:27.250 --> 38:29.125
Erm...

38:29.208 --> 38:31.542
Well, that way, I suppose.

38:32.000 --> 38:35.125
Do you wanna walk with me?

38:36.708 --> 38:38.375
Sure.

38:44.167 --> 38:46.583
So how's the datin' goin'?

38:47.542 --> 38:51.042
- Shit.
- Oh, why bother?

38:51.417 --> 38:54.583
- Because.
- Cos why?

38:58.833 --> 39:02.083
I need to find a plus one for that weddin'.

39:03.417 --> 39:05.667
So, you're going on all these dates

39:05.667 --> 39:08.792
with strangers to find someone
to bring to a wedding?

39:09.292 --> 39:10.375
Yeah.

39:10.417 --> 39:12.875
Not cos you want to meet someone?

39:13.750 --> 39:15.042
No.

39:16.500 --> 39:18.292
At least you're gettin' laid.

39:20.083 --> 39:21.542
What?

39:22.750 --> 39:25.042
Well, I'm not sleepin' with any of them.

39:25.042 --> 39:27.125
Oh, OK That's cool.

39:27.125 --> 39:29.625
Like, I mean, I don't just jump into bed
at the drop of a hat.

39:31.542 --> 39:32.958
Good to know.

39:33.125 --> 39:35.125
Do you wanna do somethin'?

39:36.250 --> 39:38.042
Oh, no, it's cool if you're busy.

39:38.042 --> 39:40.750
No. It's just I've got band practise.

39:40.750 --> 39:42.000
Oh.

39:42.292 --> 39:43.625
All right.

39:43.833 --> 39:45.500
I would, um,

39:45.500 --> 39:48.250
only we've got a gig at the weekend, so...

39:48.250 --> 39:50.208
- Well, that's cool.
- I kinda have to be there.

39:50.208 --> 39:51.458
OK.

39:52.250 --> 39:54.625
All right, well, I'm off up this way.

39:54.625 --> 39:56.292
OK.

39:57.000 --> 39:59.583
- It was good to see ya.
- Yeah, you, too.

40:02.167 --> 40:03.833
Hey!

40:05.417 --> 40:07.333
What are you doin' tomorrow?

40:07.875 --> 40:09.833
Nothin'. Why?

40:13.458 --> 40:16.250
Does it matter that I don't
know any of these people?

40:16.250 --> 40:19.667
- No. Neither do I.
- Yeah, well, you're workin'.

40:19.667 --> 40:21.875
So what? You're my assistant.

40:21.875 --> 40:24.042
Anyway, just focus on the blokes.

40:24.042 --> 40:25.500
We're finding you a man tonight.

40:25.500 --> 40:28.958
Or at the very least getting you laid
by a culchie.

40:40.250 --> 40:42.375
Hi, I'm Jess, nice to meet you.

40:45.458 --> 40:47.792
OK, can I get
everybody looking in here?

40:47.792 --> 40:49.042
That's great.

40:49.292 --> 40:51.542
So, what I think I'm gonna do is

40:51.542 --> 40:53.333
just step the girls out
for, like, two seconds

40:53.333 --> 40:55.500
and get some photos of the guys.

40:55.917 --> 40:57.292
Yeah?

40:58.000 --> 41:00.083
Yeah, just move down
a couple of steps.

41:00.083 --> 41:01.333
That's perfect.

41:01.583 --> 41:03.375
- Smile.

41:03.375 --> 41:05.167
Awesome.

41:05.500 --> 41:08.500
So, uh, have all of you got girlfriends?

41:10.000 --> 41:11.875
Hands up if you're single.

41:13.417 --> 41:16.292
You? Cool.

42:15.042 --> 42:18.792
Charlene's wedding speech,
take one, action!

42:18.875 --> 42:20.708
All day I've been looking at ya,

42:20.958 --> 42:24.167
and thinkin' how long
we've known each other

42:24.167 --> 42:26.208
and how much you mean to me.

42:26.458 --> 42:31.333
It seems like only yesterday we were walkin'
to school and makin' each other laugh.

42:31.333 --> 42:32.917
Two things...

42:32.917 --> 42:34.542
We never went to school.

42:34.542 --> 42:38.500
Like ever. We were either
suspended or we mitched.

42:38.500 --> 42:41.792
And secondly the young one never laughs.

42:41.792 --> 42:43.542
Like, I mean, ever.

42:43.542 --> 42:44.917
It gets better.

42:45.083 --> 42:47.583
You're the smartest person I know.

42:47.583 --> 42:49.833
- Ugh.
- You're gorgeous looking...

42:50.083 --> 42:52.333
The face of an actual cunt.

42:52.792 --> 42:55.583
You are the most generous
person in the world.

42:55.583 --> 42:57.583
She actually wrote this about herself?

42:57.708 --> 43:00.958
Yeah, the girl is bat-shit crazy.

43:01.333 --> 43:02.583
Hello?

43:04.125 --> 43:06.250
It's Charlene, she says your
accent needs work.

43:06.250 --> 43:07.500
Mmm.

43:09.542 --> 43:11.083
No, no, it wasn't us.

43:11.250 --> 43:12.667
Ask them for more drink.

43:13.167 --> 43:16.917
Wait, sorry. Uh, could we get some drink?

43:18.833 --> 43:20.542
He hung up.

43:21.292 --> 43:23.000
Fuck it!

43:24.750 --> 43:26.333
You're a shit matchmaker.

43:26.333 --> 43:28.875
It's your fault for bein' so picky.

43:29.250 --> 43:31.417
Why weren't we iookin' for a fella for you?

43:31.667 --> 43:33.458
I don't want one.

43:35.875 --> 43:38.167
Why, have you been with loads?

43:38.167 --> 43:40.625
What the fuck are you trying to say?

43:41.375 --> 43:42.500
Sorry.

43:42.500 --> 43:44.125
I'm only messin'.

43:46.917 --> 43:48.208
So have ya?

43:48.375 --> 43:51.333
Oh, my God, you really want to know?

43:51.833 --> 43:53.417
You mean sex?

43:55.042 --> 43:58.417
Oh, I dunno.
I don't have a number or anything.

43:58.417 --> 44:01.125
- Why, do you?
- No.

44:01.708 --> 44:04.250
You do! Tell me.

44:04.375 --> 44:05.875
- No.
- Tell me.

44:05.917 --> 44:07.417
No.

44:12.750 --> 44:14.833
I don't think I'm very good at it.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.250
Sex?

44:16.292 --> 44:23.500
No. Like meetin' people. Datin'. All that.

44:23.667 --> 44:25.292
Me neither.

44:25.750 --> 44:27.083
Fuck off.

44:27.333 --> 44:29.292
No, I'm serious.

44:29.833 --> 44:31.292
Yeah?

44:32.292 --> 44:34.833
I've always been a bit of a loner.

44:36.583 --> 44:37.833
That's cool.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.125
Is it'? I don't know.

44:42.333 --> 44:45.125
Yeah, like, whatever
makes ya happy and that.

44:45.292 --> 44:46.875
I wouldn't say it makes me happy.

44:46.875 --> 44:49.000
It's just the way it is.

44:51.917 --> 44:54.625
Sure, most people think I'm off me rocker.

44:54.667 --> 44:56.083
- Do they?
- Big time.

44:56.083 --> 44:57.458
Why?

44:59.708 --> 45:00.958
Just cos.

45:00.958 --> 45:02.375
Cos why?

45:05.000 --> 45:06.583
I dunno.

45:08.208 --> 45:10.125
I used to do a lot of stupid shit.

45:11.208 --> 45:12.792
Like what?

45:13.042 --> 45:14.583
Fightin'.

45:15.000 --> 45:17.792
What, like proper fightin'?

45:18.250 --> 45:23.875
I hurt a girl in a nightclub a while ago.
I got in a lot of trouble for it.

45:24.750 --> 45:27.333
Was in The Joy for six months.

45:28.125 --> 45:30.208
You were in jail?

45:31.000 --> 45:33.000
Fuck off!

45:38.667 --> 45:40.333
Whoa.

45:49.458 --> 45:51.875
Are ya freaked out that I told ya that?

45:53.333 --> 45:54.750
No.

45:58.917 --> 46:00.792
What are ya thinkin'?

46:02.625 --> 46:05.375
Just doesn't seem like you or somethin'.

46:08.667 --> 46:10.792
You don't know me.

47:58.792 --> 48:02.042
Oh, my God.

48:03.792 --> 48:05.375
You OK?

48:11.375 --> 48:14.875
Yeah. I dunno why...

48:18.667 --> 48:20.792
I really like you.

49:15.500 --> 49:18.542
Bye.
Goodbye.

49:25.667 --> 49:28.417
See you, Jess. Take care.
See you later.

49:39.292 --> 49:41.083
You freakin' out?

49:41.958 --> 49:43.458
No.

49:45.708 --> 49:47.417
Are You?

49:51.833 --> 49:54.583
Look, it doesn't have to mean anything.

49:57.917 --> 49:59.708
Unless...

50:03.917 --> 50:07.958
OK, I'm gonna go now
because I'm dyin' of embarrassment.

50:10.125 --> 50:13.083
I'm playin' in McPhails tomorrow night,

50:13.375 --> 50:17.625

- She's your cousin, Charlene.

53:19.458 --> 53:20.708
Come on!

53:25.333 --> 53:27.125
Who's she?

53:27.458 --> 53:29.958
The young one doin' the weddin' video.

53:31.208 --> 53:33.458
She looks like a weirdo.

53:33.458 --> 53:37.125
I know. Total freak.

53:41.292 --> 53:44.375
Why does she keep staring over here?

53:45.125 --> 53:47.667
Maybe she's checking you out.

53:52.250 --> 53:54.750
Oh, my God! She is totally checking me out.

53:54.833 --> 53:56.542
Jesus Christ!
Can nothin' go right?

53:56.542 --> 53:58.250
Charlene!

54:00.667 --> 54:05.000
All right Rita. Let's try this
again and it's "raise".

54:05.167 --> 54:06.417
Waze.

54:06.667 --> 54:08.125
I need to talk to you.

54:08.125 --> 54:10.625
Oh. Well, I need to talk to you, too.

54:12.375 --> 54:14.750
Right. You go first.

54:14.750 --> 54:17.458
OK. Erm...

54:20.333 --> 54:22.542
- You go first
- OK.

54:22.542 --> 54:25.083
This might be hard to hear,
so I'll just say it.

54:25.250 --> 54:27.708
Me and Leona were in
Fusion on Saturday night

54:27.708 --> 54:31.250
and we saw John Carter
getting off with a man.

54:31.875 --> 54:34.042
You went clubbin' with Leona?

54:34.042 --> 54:35.208
Yeah.

54:35.208 --> 54:37.500
I have been asking you to go out
with me for weeks.

54:37.500 --> 54:40.125
Mary! I think you're
missin' the point here.

54:40.125 --> 54:41.542
Yeah, we broke up.

54:41.750 --> 54:43.250
And when were you gonna tell me?

54:43.292 --> 54:45.417
Well, when do I see you, Charlene?

54:45.583 --> 54:48.042
All right look. Don't panic.
I'm not gonna say it to anyone.

54:48.042 --> 54:50.333
We'll just find you someone else
to bring as a plus one.

54:50.333 --> 54:53.542
Maybe one of Declan's friends.
Some of them are really weird.

54:54.417 --> 54:55.875
OK?

55:00.125 --> 55:01.667
Mary?

55:04.250 --> 55:05.792
What was that about?

55:05.792 --> 55:08.042
I dunno, she just stormed off.

55:08.458 --> 55:09.917
Hi.

55:10.500 --> 55:12.708
Do you wanna go on a date sometime?

55:15.750 --> 55:18.042
Um... OK.

55:18.083 --> 55:20.208
- Cool.
- Cool.

55:25.375 --> 55:28.125
What the fuck is she doing?

55:33.208 --> 55:35.542
OK.

55:35.917 --> 55:38.792
I just wanted to do that, so...

55:40.458 --> 55:45.250
Erm, I better go. I'll call ya later.

55:46.583 --> 55:47.958
Bye.

55:57.083 --> 55:58.750
When did this happen?

55:59.083 --> 56:00.625
Couple of nights ago.

56:00.917 --> 56:03.000
Was helping her out at a weddin'.

56:03.500 --> 56:04.750
And what?

56:04.958 --> 56:06.625
We were drinkin',

56:06.625 --> 56:08.583
one thing led to another.

56:09.750 --> 56:11.792
So you're into girls now?

56:13.458 --> 56:15.250
Maybe.

56:16.292 --> 56:18.583
You're makin' a show of yourself, Mary.

56:20.583 --> 56:22.750
Well, what's new, Charlene?

56:26.750 --> 56:28.875
Try on that dress, will ya?

56:36.625 --> 56:38.583
So I was thinkin'.

56:38.667 --> 56:41.083
Since you're gonna be at the weddin',

56:41.333 --> 56:45.292
and I'm gonna be at the weddin',
why don't we both go together?

56:45.292 --> 56:47.750
I thought you wanted to bring a hot bloke.

56:48.583 --> 56:50.708
Not any more.

56:53.333 --> 56:54.750
OK.

56:55.667 --> 56:58.625
Cool.

57:08.125 --> 57:09.625
What?

57:10.333 --> 57:12.042
Nothin', just...

57:12.917 --> 57:15.625
Suddenly you seem very cool about all this.

57:17.042 --> 57:19.875
It's a big change from when
we were on the bus a while back

57:19.875 --> 57:23.292
and you avoided looking at me for the
whole three-hour drive, actually.

57:23.292 --> 57:25.958
I didn't refuse to look at ya.

57:25.958 --> 57:28.250
I seem to remember you looking
out the window a lot.

57:28.250 --> 57:30.625
OK, maybe I did a bit.

57:33.375 --> 57:36.250
Then you kissed me
in front of all your mates.

57:38.583 --> 57:40.208
Fuck it.

57:41.833 --> 57:43.542
Did they say anything about it?

57:43.542 --> 57:46.583
Actually, Charlene had
a lot to say about it.

57:46.583 --> 57:49.333
Apparently I'm making a show of meself.

57:51.625 --> 57:53.292
Fuck her.

57:53.292 --> 57:55.333
She's probably just worried about you.

57:55.833 --> 57:59.000
Charlene does not give a fuck about me,

57:59.000 --> 58:02.417
she's just worried that
I'll ruin her precious weddin'.

58:03.583 --> 58:05.833
Is that why you're asking me to go?

58:06.167 --> 58:07.417
What?

58:07.417 --> 58:09.542
To piss her off?

58:11.667 --> 58:13.208
No.

58:18.000 --> 58:20.458
I don't care what Charlene thinks.

58:21.625 --> 58:24.250
Mary, you're obsessed with what she thinks.

58:25.625 --> 58:28.542
- No, I'm not.
- Yeah, you are.

58:35.333 --> 58:37.125
I don't want to be used.

58:38.333 --> 58:40.500
What the fuck does that mean?

58:41.667 --> 58:44.042
Whoa, don't curse at me.

58:50.833 --> 58:54.000
I just don't want you usin' me
to get even with Charlene.

58:54.958 --> 58:56.542
I'm not.

59:01.250 --> 59:02.917
OK.

59:12.250 --> 59:14.542
Will I get us some drinks?

01:00:04.458 --> 01:00:06.667
Hello, this is Mary...

01:00:31.708 --> 01:00:37.417
You have new voicemail.
To listen to your messages, press 1.

01:00:40.375 --> 01:00:43.583
Hey. Um,

01:00:44.542 --> 01:00:48.125
I don't really know what
happened last night and

01:00:48.417 --> 01:00:51.667
to be honest I'm not sure I care any more.

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:56.333
I guess I don't really know
what's going on with you

01:00:56.333 --> 01:00:58.750
and you don't seem to want to tell me.

01:00:59.292 --> 01:01:01.917
And running away like that is

01:01:03.250 --> 01:01:05.458
fucking ridiculous.

01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.167
That's what children do

01:01:08.375 --> 01:01:10.625
and I'm not a child.

01:01:12.833 --> 01:01:16.000
Look, I think we should
just call it quits on this.

01:01:16.583 --> 01:01:18.958
I hope everything goes well for you, Mary,

01:01:19.167 --> 01:01:21.708
and that you figure it all out.

01:01:23.667 --> 01:01:28.875
And there's no need to call me back,
I'd honestly prefer it if you didn't.

01:01:28.875 --> 01:01:32.375
OK. Bye.

01:01:38.458 --> 01:01:40.625
- Hey.
- All right?

01:01:41.458 --> 01:01:43.458
What are you doing here?

01:01:45.333 --> 01:01:47.458
Came to see you.

01:01:56.167 --> 01:01:58.708
So, what's the story with your girlfriend?

01:01:59.958 --> 01:02:01.208
What?

01:02:01.375 --> 01:02:03.625
She cancelled on me this morning.

01:02:04.958 --> 01:02:06.500
I don't know.

01:02:07.500 --> 01:02:09.417
And she's not my girlfriend.

01:02:09.708 --> 01:02:12.292
So what, you're not a lesbian now?

01:02:20.708 --> 01:02:22.667
Are you all right?

01:02:25.875 --> 01:02:27.167
Here.

01:02:27.333 --> 01:02:28.917
What's this?

01:02:29.583 --> 01:02:31.708
The speech. I wrote it.

01:02:32.208 --> 01:02:33.958
I did the speech for you.

01:02:34.208 --> 01:02:36.208
Well, it's supposed to come from me.

01:02:37.417 --> 01:02:38.708
Mary, like, I...

01:02:38.750 --> 01:02:40.458
Fine. It doesn't matter.

01:02:40.583 --> 01:02:42.417
Gimme it.

01:02:51.375 --> 01:02:54.833
"The things you need to know
about Charlene.

01:03:04.583 --> 01:03:10.458
"Her first crush was on Mr. Duffy,
our geography teacher in fifth class.

01:03:10.792 --> 01:03:15.750
"Her first kiss was on the bus on the
way home from a Boyzone concert.

01:03:16.333 --> 01:03:18.333
"Her eyes are a mixture of green and brown

01:03:18.333 --> 01:03:21.375
"and not hazel as most people think.

01:03:21.792 --> 01:03:25.333
"She loves brown sauce
and eats it on everything.

01:03:26.667 --> 01:03:29.833
"She can never remember how a joke ends.

01:03:30.167 --> 01:03:32.917
"When she's sick she
always watches the film

01:03:32.958 --> 01:03:36.500
"Ella Enchanted and eats
packets of Monster Munch.

01:03:37.042 --> 01:03:42.292
"When she walks into a room, people always
notice her and want to be around her.

01:03:42.958 --> 01:03:46.625
"This is because of her warmth and
her good sense of humour.

01:03:47.625 --> 01:03:51.000
"She loves Declan more than
anything else in the world,

01:03:51.292 --> 01:03:53.750
"even brown sauce.

01:03:54.125 --> 01:03:58.000
"And she is the best friend
that anyone could ever ask for."

01:04:01.958 --> 01:04:03.917
It's lovely.

01:04:07.292 --> 01:04:10.958
You're me best mate and
I wanted it to come from me.

01:04:12.917 --> 01:04:14.542
Thanks.

01:04:19.667 --> 01:04:21.625
Do you wanna go for a pint?

01:04:22.667 --> 01:04:24.625
I'm gettin' married tomorrow.

01:04:25.125 --> 01:04:27.875
Yeah, but is that not tradition,
that the maid of honour take

01:04:27.875 --> 01:04:30.667
the bride out the night before the big day?

01:04:30.917 --> 01:04:33.083
- No.
- For one?

01:04:33.375 --> 01:04:34.917
No!

01:04:39.250 --> 01:04:40.917
All right.

01:04:43.292 --> 01:04:45.167
I'll see ya at the church, then.

01:04:45.333 --> 01:04:46.583
Yeah.

01:04:51.417 --> 01:04:53.792
Why do you never want to see me any more?

01:04:54.167 --> 01:04:55.500
What are you on about?

01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:57.500
Why do you never want to see me?

01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:59.333
Mary, how many times
do we have to talk about this?

01:04:59.333 --> 01:05:02.042
- Fine! Fuck sake.
- Stop cursin' at me, Mary!

01:05:02.042 --> 01:05:04.542
Then stop actin' like
a stuck-up bitch, Charlene!

01:05:04.542 --> 01:05:05.667
I don't have time for this.

01:05:05.667 --> 01:05:06.750
Oh, of course ya don't,

01:05:06.750 --> 01:05:10.000
cos when do you have time
for anyone other than yourself?

01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.042
- Excuse me?
- You've fuckin' changed.

01:05:18.792 --> 01:05:20.250
Oi!

01:05:23.792 --> 01:05:26.792
Do you have any idea the
shit you've put us through?

01:05:26.792 --> 01:05:29.292
Me. Your ma. All of us.

01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.833
After what you did.

01:05:32.167 --> 01:05:34.083
Ya haven't a clue, have ya?

01:05:34.250 --> 01:05:36.083
And then you show up on me doorstep

01:05:36.083 --> 01:05:38.750
the day before me weddin'
and call me a shit friend

01:05:38.750 --> 01:05:40.917
cos I won't go drinkin' with ya.

01:05:41.083 --> 01:05:43.875
I mean, are you for fuckin' real?

01:05:45.667 --> 01:05:50.125
And you know what, Mary?
You're right. I have changed.

01:05:50.333 --> 01:05:52.375
Everyone has, except you.

01:05:52.375 --> 01:05:55.875
You're still a mess.

01:05:59.167 --> 01:06:02.083
Who the fuck wants to be around that?

01:06:28.542 --> 01:06:29.708
Hey, it's me.

01:06:29.708 --> 01:06:31.375
- How many do you want?
- Six.

01:06:31.375 --> 01:06:33.417
We're goin' out.

01:06:37.542 --> 01:06:39.792
So, where's your boyfriend at?

01:06:39.958 --> 01:06:43.042
Are you all selective cos
you got a pony tail?

01:06:43.292 --> 01:06:45.125
What's your name, delicate?

01:06:45.125 --> 01:06:47.333
- I dunno.
- Yvonne!

01:06:47.333 --> 01:06:50.667
- Yvonne?
- Oh, that's a French ass name, Yvonne.

01:06:50.667 --> 01:06:52.292
My little French croissant.

01:06:52.292 --> 01:06:54.542
You are mad.

01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:56.375
All right.

01:06:56.375 --> 01:06:59.042
I'm only joking, I'm sorry, like.

01:07:03.458 --> 01:07:05.458
Let's do somethin? Come on!

01:07:08.792 --> 01:07:10.542
Where we goin'?

01:07:11.125 --> 01:07:12.583
Out.

01:08:10.833 --> 01:08:12.583
Fuck.

01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:16.125
Don't! Don't!

01:08:16.125 --> 01:08:19.500
- Ya fuckin' animal!
- Call the guards.

01:08:25.625 --> 01:08:28.332
You're fucking buck mad you are.

01:08:29.792 --> 01:08:31.875
D'you hear me?

01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.582
Come on!

01:08:45.707 --> 01:08:49.667
Assault, anti-social
behaviour, assault again.

01:08:49.667 --> 01:08:51.542
If she ends up in front
of a prick of a judge...

01:08:51.542 --> 01:08:54.332
It's not good.
No, it's not good.

01:08:54.332 --> 01:08:55.792
You can take her home now.

01:08:55.957 --> 01:08:57.457
Thanks, Guard.

01:08:59.375 --> 01:09:00.875
Come on.

01:09:17.582 --> 01:09:19.667
Is it my fault?

01:09:22.125 --> 01:09:24.292
Is what your fault?

01:09:26.332 --> 01:09:29.542
I dunno. That you're having problems again.

01:09:31.875 --> 01:09:33.957
How is it your fault?

01:09:40.042 --> 01:09:42.750
Did ya get someone to go with ya tomorrow?

01:09:48.167 --> 01:09:51.457
Sure, so what?
You go down there and hold your head up.

01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:54.375
You're as good as any of them girls.

01:10:08.125 --> 01:10:10.625
Shh. It's OK.

01:11:01.333 --> 01:11:03.667
OK. Fix me.

01:11:08.417 --> 01:11:11.667
- I'm surprised you'd the nerve to show up.
- Leona.

01:11:13.125 --> 01:11:14.792
Leave her alone.

01:11:23.792 --> 01:11:25.750
Thanks.

01:11:31.125 --> 01:11:32.875
You look...

01:11:38.167 --> 01:11:40.417
- Are we ready?
- Yep, we're ready.

01:11:43.375 --> 01:11:46.583
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit,

01:11:46.583 --> 01:11:48.167
amen.

01:11:54.083 --> 01:11:57.458
Father,
Son and the Holy Spirit, amen.

01:11:59.792 --> 01:12:02.083
You may kiss the bride.

01:12:11.792 --> 01:12:14.458
- Ah, yes. Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:12:14.750 --> 01:12:17.458
- It's just over the far right.
- Thank you.

01:12:18.917 --> 01:12:20.958
- Hi.
- Hiya.

01:12:24.458 --> 01:12:26.708
- Hey.
- Hi.

01:12:28.833 --> 01:12:31.042
I'm so proud of ya.

01:12:31.042 --> 01:12:32.833
Thanks.

01:12:33.208 --> 01:12:36.625
I think it's better if you didn't read
out that speech you wrote.

01:12:37.458 --> 01:12:39.625
I think it's lovely and it's really funny.

01:12:39.667 --> 01:12:44.000
I just... Mary, it's just not appropriate.

01:12:48.333 --> 01:12:50.375
- What do you want me to say?
- It's OK.

01:12:50.375 --> 01:12:53.000
Leona has got it covered.
You can just sit back and enjoy your night.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:54.792
You've done loads already.

01:12:56.958 --> 01:12:58.625
OK.

01:13:05.208 --> 01:13:07.958
"All day I've been looking
at you, at me friend,

01:13:07.958 --> 01:13:11.667
"and thinking about how long we've known
each other, and how much you mean to me.

01:13:11.667 --> 01:13:15.708
"It feels like only yesterday we were walking
to school and making each other laugh.

01:13:15.708 --> 01:13:18.083
- "And now, look where we are."
- Aww.

01:13:18.083 --> 01:13:21.583
"You're the smartest person I know,
you're gorgeous looking.

01:13:21.583 --> 01:13:24.208
"And you're the most generous person
in the whole world."

01:13:25.625 --> 01:13:27.792
You are, Char.

01:13:30.458 --> 01:13:33.042
OK, folks. So, we're gonna pass it over to
the father of the bride now,

01:13:33.042 --> 01:13:35.083
so round of applause for him.

01:13:52.417 --> 01:13:54.875
Hey, this is Jess. Leave a message.

01:13:55.958 --> 01:13:59.417
Hiya, Jess. It's Mary.

01:14:00.125 --> 01:14:02.333
I know you don't want me to call, but...

01:14:02.333 --> 01:14:04.875
I'm locked. So...

01:14:08.875 --> 01:14:12.333
Actually, I'm not locked.

01:14:13.042 --> 01:14:17.500
I haven't had a drink all day
so I dunno why I said that.

01:14:25.500 --> 01:14:30.625
I just wanted to say sorry for everything
that happened.

01:14:38.292 --> 01:14:41.000
I don't know what's wrong with me.

01:14:42.750 --> 01:14:46.375
I keep hurting people and I don't know why.

01:14:53.292 --> 01:14:57.000
I think you were right
about me and Charlene.

01:14:59.083 --> 01:15:02.833
You're probably right
about a lot of things.

01:15:07.750 --> 01:15:09.833
I miss you.

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.083
Me and her were the best.

01:17:06.792 --> 01:17:09.000
The most beautiful.

01:17:11.333 --> 01:17:13.542
Me and her.

01:17:13.958 --> 01:17:15.833
Me and her.

01:17:18.958 --> 01:17:20.792
Me and her.

01:17:24.292 --> 01:17:26.250
Hey!

01:17:28.542 --> 01:17:30.292
Are you going?

01:17:30.792 --> 01:17:32.500
Yeah.

01:17:33.417 --> 01:17:36.292
All right, well... Thanks for everything.

01:17:36.917 --> 01:17:38.792
You're welcome.

01:17:40.042 --> 01:17:42.708
- I'm fuckin' married, Mary!

01:17:43.125 --> 01:17:45.333
I know.

01:17:47.417 --> 01:17:50.292
When I get back from me honeymoon,
me and you are goin' out on the town.

01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:52.625
Just the two of us.

01:18:09.625 --> 01:18:11.458
I'll see ya, Char.

01:18:11.708 --> 01:18:13.625
See ya, babe.

01:18:30.125 --> 01:18:33.292
Where would you be going,
if you were going out?

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:36.333
Music?
Are you into your music?

01:18:36.333 --> 01:18:40.083
Would you be getting up
and dancing and all? Yeah?

01:18:40.292 --> 01:18:44.083
What else do you get up to then?
Over the weekend in your spare time?

01:18:44.083 --> 01:18:47.500
I go surfin'.
You're a surfer!

01:18:47.500 --> 01:18:50.458
No way. That's mad.

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:25.083
