00:04.320 --> 00:08.040
<i>"Jackie Onassis had hidden
the Walther PPK pistol</i>

00:08.040 --> 00:09.880
<i>in her round hat.</i>

00:09.880 --> 00:13.960
<i>As the motorcade approached the
Texas Book Depository window,</i>

00:13.960 --> 00:18.800
<i>she knew this was her only chance
to finally murder her husband."</i>

00:18.800 --> 00:21.480
This is bullshit.

00:21.480 --> 00:23.520
Bullshit?

00:23.520 --> 00:25.200
How the hell would he know?

00:25.200 --> 00:28.040
Well, for a start,
her name wasn't Jackie Onassis

00:28.040 --> 00:29.840
when she was married to Kennedy.

00:29.840 --> 00:31.440
It was Jackie Kennedy!

00:31.440 --> 00:35.080
Oh! So, he's a historian
as well as a shitty actor!

00:35.080 --> 00:39.720
OK, but did you know she was having
an affair with Onassis at the time?

00:39.720 --> 00:41.360
No, she wasn't!

00:41.360 --> 00:44.320
She didn't meet Onassis until
many years later.

00:44.320 --> 00:46.560
Come on, you got to help me
out with this guy.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.040
Clem Fandango!

00:48.040 --> 00:49.880
What do you think?
Do I need this shit?

00:49.880 --> 00:53.760
Yeah, and who told you Jackie
Kennedy assassinated her husband?

00:53.760 --> 00:56.720
Who told me? A few guys told me.

00:56.720 --> 00:59.200
A couple of guys who were there.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.400
But more importantly,
Arnold Schwarzenegger!

01:02.400 --> 01:03.680
What?!

01:03.680 --> 01:05.320
So, he was there, too, was he?

01:05.320 --> 01:07.680
No, he wasn't there, you asshole!

01:07.680 --> 01:09.560
He was married to the Kennedys!

01:09.560 --> 01:11.600
Which one? All of them?

01:11.600 --> 01:13.600
All right, you... You know what?

01:13.600 --> 01:15.560
Maybe we should crack on, guys?

01:15.560 --> 01:17.880
You know, hell of a lot
to get through.

01:17.880 --> 01:20.560
Hi, Sola, this is Clem Fandango.
Can you hear me?

01:20.560 --> 01:22.560
Yes, I can hear you, Clem Fandango.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.120
What do you...
what do you want?

01:26.120 --> 01:28.920
Nothing. I was just making
sure you can hear me.

01:28.920 --> 01:31.640
Look, do we have to use
this Toast guy?

01:31.640 --> 01:34.440
His attitude stinks,
he sounds like George Lazenby,

01:34.440 --> 01:38.040
he's not professional at all,
his delivery is terrible.

01:38.040 --> 01:40.240
And don't get me started
on his hair...

01:43.280 --> 01:46.760
What, is he saying something?
Sorry, I've lost Sola's sound.

01:46.760 --> 01:50.320
Maybe we should continue with me
just reading the book?

01:50.320 --> 01:52.480
OK, Steven, maybe...
maybe we do that.

01:52.480 --> 01:53.880
Yeah.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.600
Yeah, we've got another 95,000 words
to get through, Steven.

01:56.600 --> 01:58.000
OK.

01:59.080 --> 02:02.200
<i>"She thought of her
millionaire Greek lover</i>

02:02.200 --> 02:05.600
<i>and of her philandering
presidential husband.</i>

02:05.600 --> 02:09.200
<i>Soon she would be free of Jack
and enjoying the high life</i>

02:09.200 --> 02:12.360
<i>on one of Onassis's luxury yachts."</i>

02:52.160 --> 02:54.720
This is so great, Jennifyer.

02:54.720 --> 02:57.680
Can I just ask a question,
Mr Chickentoss?

02:57.680 --> 03:00.240
Call me Richard. Go ahead.

03:00.240 --> 03:03.560
Isn't this more like the kind of
thing a hospital visitor would do

03:03.560 --> 03:05.720
rather than a doctor?

03:05.720 --> 03:08.440
That is such a great question.

03:08.440 --> 03:12.120
But, occasionally, a doctor may
place a vase beside a patient

03:12.120 --> 03:14.280
to make them feel more comfortable

03:14.280 --> 03:16.400
before giving them some
terrible news.

03:16.400 --> 03:18.080
Oh, right.

03:18.080 --> 03:19.880
OK, I get it.
No, they wouldn't...

03:19.880 --> 03:22.200
OK. So, everybody,
grab your stethoscopes

03:22.200 --> 03:24.240
from beneath your chairs.

03:25.560 --> 03:27.800
David, you want to try this?

03:27.800 --> 03:29.800
Just place the stethoscope
around your neck

03:29.800 --> 03:31.680
and look concerned.

03:35.800 --> 03:37.280
OK.

03:37.280 --> 03:39.640
Uh... Steven, we've not
seen much from you today.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.680
Would you like to try that?

03:41.680 --> 03:42.800
Yeah...

03:50.840 --> 03:52.360
Wow.

03:52.360 --> 03:54.680
That's very, very good, Steven.

03:54.680 --> 03:56.360
Have you played a doctor before?

03:56.360 --> 03:59.200
No. Uh, well, I...

03:59.200 --> 04:02.480
...played a vet in an episode
of The Archers for Radio 4,

04:02.480 --> 04:04.400
but I think they lost the tapes.

04:04.400 --> 04:06.080
I see.

04:06.080 --> 04:08.440
Now, could you try listening?

04:08.440 --> 04:09.560
Yeah.

04:09.560 --> 04:12.640
OK, listening is very important
in doctor acting.

04:12.640 --> 04:14.880
Imagine that a patient
is telling you

04:14.880 --> 04:17.040
his or her terrible symptoms.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.160
Oh...!

04:23.160 --> 04:26.120
It's very obvious to me that
you've played doctors before.

04:26.120 --> 04:27.360
It's so obvious.

04:27.360 --> 04:28.400
I haven't.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.520
Follow that!

04:30.520 --> 04:32.480
OK, everyone, that's all for today.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.200
We'll see you tomorrow,
except for Steven.

04:35.200 --> 04:37.160
Honestly...

04:37.160 --> 04:38.960
...I have nothing more to teach you.

04:40.320 --> 04:41.560
Good Lord.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.120
Hi, uh, Steven.

04:45.120 --> 04:47.880
I've been doing doctor acting
classes for ten years,

04:47.880 --> 04:51.040
and I have never seen anything
like what you did today.

04:51.040 --> 04:52.360
Really?

04:52.360 --> 04:54.240
I mean, that was nothing.

04:54.240 --> 04:57.640
I'm actually here in the States
because I'm playing the lead role

04:57.640 --> 04:59.720
in the new Star Wars movie.

04:59.720 --> 05:01.800
Yeah, sure(!)

05:01.800 --> 05:03.400
What?

05:03.400 --> 05:05.200
Are you playing Dr Spock?

05:05.200 --> 05:06.640
Doctor who?

05:06.640 --> 05:08.280
Oh, Doctor Who.

05:08.280 --> 05:11.360
I don't think anyone watches
that over here any more.

05:12.360 --> 05:14.840
Anyway, would you mind...?

05:23.280 --> 05:26.240
You know, I've been meaning
to ask you a question.

05:26.240 --> 05:28.160
You're an actor. Right.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.840
How do you cry on camera?

05:30.840 --> 05:32.200
Well, it's a good question.

05:32.200 --> 05:34.920
Mostly applies to straight actors,
and by <i>straight </i>I'm not referring

05:34.920 --> 05:36.680
to their sexual orientation.

05:36.680 --> 05:38.920
I mean serious dramatic actors.

05:38.920 --> 05:40.840
Actors who cannot do comedy.

05:40.840 --> 05:43.880
Your not funny, so how do you do it?

05:43.880 --> 05:45.840
Well...

05:45.840 --> 05:48.720
...I just focus on a spot
in the distance,

05:48.720 --> 05:52.880
I think about snakes, monsters,
aliens—all under my bed—

05:52.880 --> 05:56.280
and when that thought gets
too much, I cry.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.000
Puta de madre!

05:58.000 --> 06:01.680
Hay un hombre ahi abajo...

06:01.680 --> 06:04.160
Some guy blocking
the entrance where?

06:04.160 --> 06:05.600
Show me.

06:07.360 --> 06:08.760
Hey!

06:08.760 --> 06:10.280
Get out of there!

06:10.280 --> 06:12.280
You're blocking the entrance
to my building!

06:12.280 --> 06:13.520
What's happening?

06:13.520 --> 06:15.200
Some homeless guy and his mattress

06:15.200 --> 06:17.000
right in front of the
doorway down there.

06:17.000 --> 06:18.440
You believe that shit?!

06:26.320 --> 06:27.600
Ugh...

06:38.960 --> 06:40.840
How about that, buddy?

06:40.840 --> 06:42.680
Ah...! You like that?

06:42.680 --> 06:44.800
Huh? Argh!

06:49.080 --> 06:52.040
Yo conozco ese hombre.

06:52.040 --> 06:53.560
Si...

06:53.560 --> 06:55.720
No es tu papa?

06:56.960 --> 06:58.560
Was that man out there your father?

06:58.560 --> 07:01.040
Yeah! So what?!

07:01.040 --> 07:04.760
Haven't seen him in 40 years,
since I was five.

07:04.760 --> 07:06.960
Did he leave home
when you were five?

07:06.960 --> 07:08.440
I left home when I was five.

07:08.440 --> 07:09.880
I had enough of those assholes.

07:09.880 --> 07:11.200
Fuck...

07:16.080 --> 07:17.960
Was that really his father?

07:19.920 --> 07:23.120
Can I just start by saying
Mark Ruffalo absolutely

07:23.120 --> 07:25.800
loved your audition. What?

07:25.800 --> 07:29.120
He said he follows you on the
Twitter and the Instagram,

07:29.120 --> 07:32.120
which is where he noticed your tweet
announcing your donation

07:32.120 --> 07:34.480
to his Climate Solutions Project.

07:34.480 --> 07:37.720
How many people retweeted that?
Was it two million?

07:37.720 --> 07:40.720
You're getting me confused
with another actor!

07:41.840 --> 07:43.680
Oh, yeah.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.520
I'm Steven Toast.

07:45.520 --> 07:48.200
Ah, shit, so you are, yeah.

07:48.200 --> 07:50.280
I'm getting confused.

07:50.280 --> 07:52.680
It's been a busy morning.

07:52.680 --> 07:55.560
Do you know anyone in LA
with a spare room?

07:55.560 --> 07:57.160
I need to move out.

07:57.160 --> 07:59.880
Russ Nightlife is
driving me crackers.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.040
You want to move out,
you need cash, buddy.

08:02.040 --> 08:04.960
Everybody knows there's money
in playing doctors.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.960
Who knew you'd be such
a goddamn natural?

08:07.960 --> 08:10.560
You sure impressed the hell out
of Richard Chickentoss.

08:10.560 --> 08:13.560
I didn't do anything. I don't know
what all the fuss is about.

08:13.560 --> 08:17.240
Oh, we have to strike while
the iron's red hot, baby!

08:17.240 --> 08:19.160
You know a Bellender Bojangles?

08:19.160 --> 08:20.840
Belinda Bojangles?

08:20.840 --> 08:22.520
No, <i>BELLENDER </i>Bojangles.

08:22.520 --> 08:25.560
B-E-L-L-E-N-D-E-R.

08:25.560 --> 08:27.160
Unusual name.

08:27.160 --> 08:29.560
Though, we are in the US of A.

08:29.560 --> 08:32.000
She's producing a new TV show
set in a hospital,

08:32.000 --> 08:33.960
it's the latest vehicle for Carmen.

08:33.960 --> 08:36.000
You've heard of Carmen, right? No.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.640
The audition is tomorrow.

08:37.640 --> 08:39.320
I'm going to call Bellender now.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.320
Brooke! That car!

08:45.480 --> 08:47.120
Bell.

08:47.120 --> 08:48.840
Sure.

08:56.720 --> 08:58.280
Steven! Hi!

08:58.280 --> 09:00.040
My name's Hoop Kaaak,

09:00.040 --> 09:02.080
that's Kaaak with three As,
director of the show.

09:02.080 --> 09:04.520
Bellender's a little late,
but, you know, that's all right.

09:04.520 --> 09:06.920
We can get to know each other
a little bit. Steven!

09:06.920 --> 09:09.720
I'm Bellender Bojangles.
I'm sorry I'm late.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.960
Brooke has told me all about you.

09:11.960 --> 09:15.600
I am so excited to meet you.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.440
This is so super exciting.

09:19.520 --> 09:21.640
Bellender, I love your shoes.

09:21.640 --> 09:22.840
Oh, thank you.

09:22.840 --> 09:24.280
They're the latest thing.

09:24.280 --> 09:26.560
They're based on the horseshoes,
which are actually nailed

09:26.560 --> 09:29.200
on to your foot,
so they're a perfect fit.

09:29.200 --> 09:30.920
It's only very minor surgery, so...

09:30.920 --> 09:32.560
Mm, they're great.

09:32.560 --> 09:33.720
Hugs all round.

09:35.160 --> 09:36.360
Oh!

09:36.360 --> 09:38.360
What do we like here, Hoop?
Hugs and smiles!

09:38.360 --> 09:39.640
And what do we do here, Hoop?

09:39.640 --> 09:42.880
We love entertaining people
and we love making TV shows.

09:42.880 --> 09:44.440
Do you want in, Steven?

09:44.440 --> 09:46.560
Uh...I'm good, thanks.

09:46.560 --> 09:48.000
OK.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.400
I hear you just completed
the doctor acting class

09:54.400 --> 09:56.160
with Rich Chickentoss.

09:56.160 --> 09:57.600
How'd that go for you?

09:59.000 --> 10:01.320
We heard you kicked ass.

10:01.320 --> 10:02.960
I didn't really do anything.

10:02.960 --> 10:06.520
You are being humble, Steven.
We don't do humble in this town.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.000
Well, actually, the real reason
why I am in this town

10:09.000 --> 10:11.680
is cos I'm starring in
the new Star Wars movie.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.920
Yeah, sure.

10:12.920 --> 10:14.160
Sorry?

10:14.160 --> 10:16.040
Would you like to have a read
of some of the script?

10:16.040 --> 10:17.520
I'll find us some hard copies.

10:17.520 --> 10:19.760
Uh, let me just stop you there,
Hoop, if you don't mind.

10:19.760 --> 10:23.000
Steven, would you be OK with
improvising a little?

10:23.000 --> 10:24.080
What?

10:24.080 --> 10:26.560
I was thinking, you could just say
some general doctor things.

10:26.560 --> 10:28.080
You know, anything you like.

10:28.080 --> 10:30.480
As long as they're doctor related.

10:30.480 --> 10:31.840
Uh...

10:33.880 --> 10:35.960
One more thing, Mrs Wisehunt.

10:35.960 --> 10:38.280
Now, I've just seen your X-rays,

10:38.280 --> 10:40.080
and you have six months to live.

10:43.680 --> 10:45.040
Something else.

10:47.080 --> 10:48.960
Are you unwell, Captain?

10:48.960 --> 10:50.480
Oh, that's very good.

10:50.480 --> 10:51.600
Really?

10:51.600 --> 10:53.080
This is amazing. Keep going.

10:53.080 --> 10:55.120
You try any more shit like that,
Mrs Greenflash,

10:55.120 --> 10:57.120
and I'll have to take
your temperature.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.720
Oh...!

10:58.720 --> 11:00.480
Mother, you've got gout.

11:00.480 --> 11:04.000
Probably due to the amount of whisky
and cigars you consume!

11:07.400 --> 11:08.880
That's so good.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.200
Thank you.

11:10.200 --> 11:12.720
May I ask, to be this good,
I'm presuming you've worked

11:12.720 --> 11:14.560
as an actual doctor, right?

11:14.560 --> 11:15.800
No.

11:15.800 --> 11:19.320
I once played a vet on an episode
of The Archers on Radio 4,

11:19.320 --> 11:21.480
but I think they lost the tapes.

11:21.480 --> 11:22.960
It is uncanny.

11:22.960 --> 11:26.000
I loved how you worked out that not
only that your mother had gout,

11:26.000 --> 11:28.240
but also how she got it.

11:28.240 --> 11:30.440
Genius. Well, thank you.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.560
You know, my own doctor was
just fired for having sex

11:32.560 --> 11:34.160
with his colleague's twin sisters.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.760
Really?

11:35.760 --> 11:37.360
Some guys have all the luck.

11:42.080 --> 11:43.160
I'm sorry.

11:46.520 --> 11:48.000
Yes...

11:48.000 --> 11:50.200
Gina, would you tell everybody
coming in later to audition

11:50.200 --> 11:52.120
for the Doctor Grainger part
not to bother?

11:52.120 --> 11:53.760
Ooh, that's good.

11:53.760 --> 11:56.760
I'm presuming you're new to LA,
Steven? Where are you staying?

11:56.760 --> 11:59.280
I'm staying with a friend.
Well, he's not really a friend.

11:59.280 --> 12:01.320
If I'm honest,
I'm desperate to get out.

12:01.320 --> 12:03.360
Well, I think you may be in luck.

12:03.360 --> 12:05.840
I have a great place here
in Beverly Hills,

12:05.840 --> 12:08.240
but I recently moved out
to Santa Monica.

12:08.240 --> 12:11.080
Why don't you stay in my
Beverly Hills apartment?

12:11.080 --> 12:12.120
Really?

12:12.120 --> 12:14.160
It's a fantastic penthouse.

12:14.160 --> 12:16.440
Here, I'll give you the key now.

12:17.520 --> 12:18.880
Thank you.

12:18.880 --> 12:22.080
You can stay there as long as
you want, rent-free obviously.

12:22.080 --> 12:24.840
It's having a multi-million-dollar
refurb at the moment.

12:24.840 --> 12:28.280
But as soon as that's completed,
it's all yours, Steven.

12:28.280 --> 12:29.880
Should only be a couple of weeks.

12:29.880 --> 12:31.280
Sounds splendid.

12:31.280 --> 12:32.480
Welcome aboard, Steven!

12:33.760 --> 12:36.920
My God, you are going to have such
fantastic chemistry with Carmen.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.880
She's in such a great place
right now.

12:38.880 --> 12:42.960
Remarried for the fifth time to
Rodrigos, who we all love dearly.

12:42.960 --> 12:44.880
You guys are going to be
great together.

12:44.880 --> 12:47.320
I'm so super excited to start!

12:47.320 --> 12:48.520
Hot damn!

13:04.600 --> 13:05.720
Thrust?

13:32.600 --> 13:33.920
Steven.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.080
You're here?

13:35.080 --> 13:36.560
I've been here for three hours.

13:36.560 --> 13:38.160
Ah, shoot! No-one told you?

13:38.160 --> 13:39.360
No.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.720
Oh. Sorry, Steven.

13:40.720 --> 13:42.680
You see, Carmen is always
three hours late.

13:42.680 --> 13:45.520
So, if we say nine o'clock,
we know she'll turn up at 12:00.

13:45.520 --> 13:48.240
I'm so sorry,
someone should have told you.

13:48.240 --> 13:49.760
Hayley.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.840
Why did you forget to tell Mr Toast
not to turn up till 12:00?

13:52.840 --> 13:54.240
Erm...

13:55.320 --> 13:56.520
I don't think I was...

13:56.520 --> 13:58.320
OK, Hayley.

13:58.320 --> 14:01.360
Now I look like a douchebag
in front of our actor.

14:01.360 --> 14:03.640
So one of us has to leave
the company.

14:10.640 --> 14:11.920
Jesus, that's harsh.

14:11.920 --> 14:13.360
My apologies, Steven.

14:13.360 --> 14:14.880
That obviously won't happen again.

14:20.680 --> 14:22.520
Come on, boys!

14:22.520 --> 14:24.560
Come closer.

14:24.560 --> 14:27.720
You know what turns me on!

Hello!

15:00.800 --> 15:02.840
Mwah, mwah, mwah!

15:02.840 --> 15:05.600
So, Hoop, you want to tell everyone
a little bit about the show?

15:05.600 --> 15:07.320
Yes. I'm Hoop Kaaak,

15:07.320 --> 15:09.880
that's Kaaak with three As,
the director of our show.

15:09.880 --> 15:12.000
It's called The Hospital,

15:12.000 --> 15:14.400
and it's about a hospital in
New York for sick children,

15:14.400 --> 15:17.760
which is run by a very conscientious
doctor, called Doctor Grainger,

15:17.760 --> 15:19.560
who will be played by Steven...

15:20.760 --> 15:22.240
Steven, uh...?

15:22.240 --> 15:24.200
Toast. Toast.

15:25.400 --> 15:28.280
The hospital has no money,
so the owners are forced to sell

15:28.280 --> 15:31.640
to a glamorous, rich entrepreneur,
called Trace Willoughby,

15:31.640 --> 15:33.440
who is also a super bitch,

15:33.440 --> 15:35.880
played by the extraordinary Carmen,

15:35.880 --> 15:39.280
who, quite frankly, is no stranger
to playing super bitches!

15:39.280 --> 15:41.240
I am a super bitch!

15:41.240 --> 15:42.880
Boo! Boo!

15:42.880 --> 15:44.440
You love it. You love it!

15:44.440 --> 15:46.000
You want it!

15:46.000 --> 15:47.360
Boo!

15:47.360 --> 15:49.840
Trace immediately plans
to knock down the hospital

15:49.840 --> 15:52.280
due to its value as prime
real estate.

15:52.280 --> 15:55.320
But can Doctor Grainger stop her
and save the sick children?

15:55.320 --> 15:56.760
Ooh!

15:58.400 --> 15:59.920
OK, let's start.

16:01.240 --> 16:04.920
Scene one. Interior hospital. Day.

16:07.120 --> 16:08.960
Splendid.

16:08.960 --> 16:12.000
Well, I don't see why we can't
get in touch with your mother

16:12.000 --> 16:14.040
and she'll pick you up
and home you go.

16:14.040 --> 16:15.680
Would you like that?

16:15.680 --> 16:17.800
Excellent.

16:17.800 --> 16:19.480
Doctor Grainger.

16:19.480 --> 16:22.360
You have until next Tuesday to
get rid of these sick children

16:22.360 --> 16:25.080
and find somewhere else to live.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.040
You won't get away with this,
Trace Willoughby.

16:27.040 --> 16:30.200
I'll fight you every step of
the way, you heartless witch.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.440
And I know how your husband died.

16:32.440 --> 16:36.200
Ha! Conrad died of natural causes!

16:36.200 --> 16:40.160
How can an axe to the back of the
head be described as natural causes?

16:40.160 --> 16:44.240
I have one thing to say to you,
Doctor Grainger.

16:44.240 --> 16:45.760
What?

16:45.760 --> 16:47.040

16:56.520 --> 16:59.480
Why does she have to sing a song
in every bloody episode?

16:59.480 --> 17:01.880
It's supposed to be a serious drama.

17:01.880 --> 17:04.560
Cos she's a singer, not an actress.

17:05.560 --> 17:07.360
She's not even Brazilian.

17:07.360 --> 17:08.880
She's Irish.

17:08.880 --> 17:11.760
Well, then, why not hire
a non-singing actress?

17:11.760 --> 17:13.800
Like every other hospital show.

17:15.080 --> 17:16.440
Wait here, Toast.

17:16.440 --> 17:18.920
I got to get my painkillers
out of the trunk.

17:18.920 --> 17:20.360
Right.

17:20.360 --> 17:21.800
Oh...!

17:27.520 --> 17:29.800
Ooh...! Hey, man.

17:29.800 --> 17:31.920
I don't have any money and...

17:31.920 --> 17:33.600
...my mother will be back soon.

17:34.800 --> 17:36.480
Jesus Christ!

17:36.480 --> 17:38.040
Ha! He talks real funny.

17:38.040 --> 17:40.160
Is he from the olden times?

17:40.160 --> 17:41.720
Ew!

17:41.720 --> 17:44.280
Look at all these creepy photos!

17:45.280 --> 17:46.920
See you around, brother.

17:52.520 --> 17:54.920
Must have left them on
the gas station counter.

17:54.920 --> 17:56.840
Goddamn it!

17:58.440 --> 18:01.040
So, first show goes out tonight.

18:01.040 --> 18:02.360
You excited?

18:02.360 --> 18:03.640
Yeah.

18:03.640 --> 18:06.240
Ah, give it a couple of weeks,
people start kissing your ass

18:06.240 --> 18:09.160
when you they see you,
you'll know it's a hit!

What about those sick kids?

18:30.560 --> 18:32.400
You're one shitty lady.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.800
I don't care what
you assholes think.

18:34.800 --> 18:37.160
Why don't you go fuck yourselves?

18:37.160 --> 18:38.880
Such language!

18:38.880 --> 18:41.640
Not to mention,
those poor sick children.

18:41.640 --> 18:45.240
Who cares? I can get a billion
dollars for that old building.

18:45.240 --> 18:48.240
How do you like that,
you weasel-faced witch?

18:48.240 --> 18:50.560
But we all love you,
Doctor Grainger.

18:50.560 --> 18:52.560
You're my favourite
on the show.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.560
I'm not really Doctor Grainger.

18:54.560 --> 18:56.640
It's a part.
Play along, Toast.

18:56.640 --> 18:58.360
They love it.

18:58.360 --> 19:01.760
Hey, you two! Oh, yes!

19:01.760 --> 19:03.120
Mwah!

19:05.200 --> 19:07.360
Mm!

19:10.440 --> 19:14.120
Oh, God, I love hugging people!

19:14.120 --> 19:15.960
Yes, you do.

19:15.960 --> 19:18.360
So, the show is a huge success.

19:18.360 --> 19:20.240
Are you two getting great feedback?

19:20.240 --> 19:23.240
Everyone loves a super bitch!

19:23.240 --> 19:26.760
And I hear they love you, too, Steven.

19:26.760 --> 19:29.240
Well, it's not me, is it?
It's the character.

19:29.240 --> 19:32.160
I've been wondering something,
Steven, what is the whole story

19:32.160 --> 19:34.520
behind the, uh...
you know, the white?

19:34.520 --> 19:36.040
I fell out of a tree,

19:36.040 --> 19:38.640
like the Olympic swimmer,
Duncan Goodhew.

19:38.640 --> 19:40.200
OK, listen to this.

19:40.200 --> 19:44.600
I got a letter from a couple who
really love the show, uber fans,

19:44.600 --> 19:49.880
but not only is the guy's mother a
crazy super-duper fan of the show...

19:49.880 --> 19:52.120
...but especially of you,
Steven Toast.

19:52.120 --> 19:53.760
Really?

19:53.760 --> 19:55.800
Oh, I got to get this.

19:55.800 --> 19:57.360
It's Rodrigos.

19:57.360 --> 20:00.120
They have a small request.

20:00.120 --> 20:02.800
Would you go and visit his mother
in hospital?

20:02.800 --> 20:05.640
She has not been well lately.

20:05.640 --> 20:09.160
Are you serious? Doctor Grainger
in an actual hospital?

20:09.160 --> 20:12.240
It'll be great publicity
for the show.

20:12.240 --> 20:14.680
Rodrigos is gay!

20:14.680 --> 20:15.840
I'm sorry?

20:15.840 --> 20:17.880
Rodrigos is gay!

20:17.880 --> 20:19.800
He just told me!

20:19.800 --> 20:21.560
I am distraught!

20:21.560 --> 20:23.480
I can't live with him any more!

20:23.480 --> 20:26.080
Can I stay in your
Beverly Hills place, please?

20:26.080 --> 20:27.720
Of course.

20:27.720 --> 20:29.680
No...

20:29.680 --> 20:32.240
Steven, have you got the key
to my apartment in Beverly Hills?

20:32.240 --> 20:34.880
You haven't moved in yet, have you?

20:34.880 --> 20:36.520
Well, I was planning on
moving in today.

20:36.520 --> 20:38.520
I packed all my belongings
this morning.

20:38.520 --> 20:39.800
Is the key in your apartment?

20:39.800 --> 20:41.760
I think Carmen needs the place
a bit more than you.

20:41.760 --> 20:43.000
I mean, look at her.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.320
He's gay!

20:44.320 --> 20:45.840
We need that key. Oh...!

20:45.840 --> 20:48.200
He has a boyfriend called Carlos!

20:48.200 --> 20:50.560
They've been fucking for six months!

20:52.720 --> 20:53.840
Toast!

20:53.840 --> 20:56.000
Your stuff is still here.
I thought you were moving out!

20:57.320 --> 20:58.760
Who the hell are these two?!

20:58.760 --> 21:00.280
You can't bring people here!

21:00.280 --> 21:01.840
No-one should know where I am!

21:01.840 --> 21:04.200
Yeah, this is Carmen,
the pop legend.

21:04.200 --> 21:06.160
How can you not know it's me?!

21:07.320 --> 21:09.600
And this is Bell...
I'm Bellender Bojangles.

21:09.600 --> 21:11.120
I like to hug people
when I meet them.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.440
No, no, no. Oh, come on.

21:12.440 --> 21:13.560
No, no, no.

21:13.560 --> 21:15.760
No, no, no, he doesn't like
close personal contact.

21:15.760 --> 21:18.000
I say, Russ, you've trodden
on her scarf.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.640
Let me help with that.

21:19.640 --> 21:21.400
Whoa!

21:21.400 --> 21:22.600
Shit!

21:24.120 --> 21:25.320
Oh!

21:25.320 --> 21:27.120
Oh. That's lucky.

21:27.120 --> 21:28.880
He landed on a soiled mattress.

21:28.880 --> 21:31.000
Who is that old homeless man?

21:31.000 --> 21:33.800
I don't believe it. My boy!

21:33.800 --> 21:36.240
: Not now, Dad. Just get off!

21:36.240 --> 21:38.120
That's his father.

21:38.120 --> 21:39.640
Get off!

21:39.640 --> 21:42.720
Don't hug him! He doesn't like
close personal contact!

21:48.960 --> 21:50.840
Hey, Ma?

21:50.840 --> 21:54.280
This here's Steven Toast.

21:54.280 --> 21:56.520
You remember,
you wrote him a letter?

21:56.520 --> 21:59.040
She's a lot older than I expected.

21:59.040 --> 22:00.920
She's 93.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.640
She's been in and out of hospital
constantly for the past, like,

22:03.640 --> 22:06.440
what, 25 years.
She fell down her steps last week.

22:06.440 --> 22:08.360
Now she's completely fucked.
Look at her.

22:08.360 --> 22:10.880
We've had to visit her a lot.

22:10.880 --> 22:13.160
I mean a lot. Way too much.

22:13.160 --> 22:16.480
We're from New York, so it's
a flight over here to see her.

22:16.480 --> 22:18.440
It's a pain in the ass
is what it is.

22:18.440 --> 22:20.280
Yeah, but I imagine she can't help
being ill.

22:20.280 --> 22:22.280
Oh, yeah, right. OK, Steven!

22:22.280 --> 22:24.800
Anyways, no point in hanging around.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.640
The knob is there.

22:26.640 --> 22:29.760
All you got to do is turn it to
the right, and it'll all be over.

22:29.760 --> 22:31.000
What?!

22:31.000 --> 22:33.160
It was her last request.
What was?

22:33.160 --> 22:35.000
For you to turn off her
life-support machine!

22:35.000 --> 22:36.280
It was her dying wish!

22:36.280 --> 22:38.880
Hey, look, time's tight here, honey.
We got a plane to catch back home,

22:38.880 --> 22:40.480
for the dogs,
you know what I'm saying?

22:40.480 --> 22:42.160
Hang on. What do the doctors
think of this?

22:42.160 --> 22:43.480
Oh...!

22:43.480 --> 22:45.160
My mother hates the doctors, OK?

22:45.160 --> 22:46.960
She could give two shits
what they think.

22:46.960 --> 22:48.360
She didn't want a doctor doing it.

22:48.360 --> 22:50.000
She asked for you.

22:50.000 --> 22:52.400
She loves that show you're in!

22:52.400 --> 22:54.080
Don't do it...

22:54.080 --> 22:55.960
She just said something. No...

22:55.960 --> 22:58.120
I heard nothing. You hear
something? I heard nothing.

22:58.120 --> 22:59.320
No, nothing.

22:59.320 --> 23:01.160
This is some dark shit.

23:01.160 --> 23:02.920
I shouldn't even be here.
What...?

23:02.920 --> 23:05.280
Steven! Steven, where you going?!

23:05.280 --> 23:06.920
You come back here!

23:10.360 --> 23:13.680
Yeah, sure, it's odd,
but the main thing is,

23:13.680 --> 23:16.640
the show is a big success.

23:16.640 --> 23:17.800
Yes, it is.

23:17.800 --> 23:20.880
Maybe I should ask Bellender
for a pay rise.

23:20.880 --> 23:22.920
Well, they signed you up
for two seasons,

23:22.920 --> 23:25.200
we agreed the same fee for both.

23:25.200 --> 23:28.280
You want more dollars,
she'll have to change the contract.

23:28.280 --> 23:31.040
Yeah, I can be pretty persuasive
when I try.

23:31.040 --> 23:32.640
Let me have a word with her.

23:35.640 --> 23:38.320
Why are you dressed like a clown?

23:38.320 --> 23:40.560
I'm celebrating. I'm a star now.

23:40.560 --> 23:43.320
You said yourself,
people love my character.

23:43.320 --> 23:45.960
Yes, of course they do, Steven!

23:45.960 --> 23:49.280
It's no secret that Carmen gets paid
a hell of a lot more than I do,

23:49.280 --> 23:51.720
and she's staying in
your fancy mansion.

23:51.720 --> 23:54.360
I'm sorry, the contract
is legally binding,

23:54.360 --> 23:57.080
and there's not a thing
I can do about it.

23:57.080 --> 23:58.440
Bloody irritating.

23:58.440 --> 24:00.600
Come on. Give me a hug.

24:00.600 --> 24:03.120
No, no, I'm not going to fall
for that hug bullshit.

24:03.120 --> 24:04.400
Come on.

24:04.400 --> 24:06.480
Oh, you big bear of a man.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.480
The show is a success.

24:08.480 --> 24:10.160
What more could you want?

24:12.760 --> 24:16.080
Oh. There is another issue
I'd like to talk about.

24:16.080 --> 24:17.640
What issue?

24:17.640 --> 24:21.160
There is a chance...
you may be arrested for murder.

24:25.440 --> 24:26.680
What?!

24:26.680 --> 24:28.880
That family who contacted you,

24:28.880 --> 24:31.840
did you turn off their mother's
life-support machine?

24:31.840 --> 24:33.600
No, I bloody did not!

24:33.600 --> 24:36.720
Well, she's dead now, so somebody did,
without a doctor present,

24:36.720 --> 24:38.560
which kind of makes it
a criminal matter.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.640
The family did it, they couldn't
wait to get rid of her.

24:40.640 --> 24:41.920
They say you did it.

24:41.920 --> 24:43.640
No, they asked me to do it.

24:43.640 --> 24:46.120
Poor old girl hadn't even
seen the show.

24:46.120 --> 24:50.440
If you were charged with murder,
it would reflect badly on the show.

24:50.440 --> 24:51.960
Not necessarily.

24:51.960 --> 24:54.080
The LAPD are looking into it.

24:54.080 --> 24:57.240
They say that there is footage
of you fleeing the building.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.120
Yeah, I was trying to
get away from them.

24:59.120 --> 25:00.720
I wouldn't mind, Steven.

25:00.720 --> 25:03.040
But you're Doctor Grainger.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.920
You're supposed to be the good guy.

25:04.920 --> 25:06.400
I am the good guy.

25:08.960 --> 25:10.760
Would you stop looking dubious?

25:11.800 --> 25:15.240
Anyway, you can't fire me,
I'm contracted for a second series.

25:15.240 --> 25:17.840
And as you said yourself,
it's legally binding.

25:22.240 --> 25:23.680
Carmen!

25:36.920 --> 25:38.480
You're three hours late, Steven.

25:38.480 --> 25:39.680
Yeah, but I thought...

25:39.680 --> 25:43.520
Since Rodrigos has left,
now I am always on time.

25:50.360 --> 25:53.200
OK, we've waited long enough.
Let's start.

25:55.880 --> 25:58.400
Scene one. Interior hospital. Night.

25:58.400 --> 26:02.080
We see Trace Willoughby alone
in the ward. It is late.

26:02.080 --> 26:03.360
Doctor Grainger enters.

26:04.400 --> 26:07.000
You wanted to see me,
Mrs Willoughby? If it's about...

26:07.000 --> 26:09.400
Trace Willoughby stabs
Doctor Grainger with a knife.

26:09.400 --> 26:13.000
He falls in a cowardly manner
to the floor.

26:13.000 --> 26:14.840
He lies there motionless,

26:14.840 --> 26:17.240
like a piece of shit.

26:17.240 --> 26:18.880
He's dead.

26:18.880 --> 26:20.240
Very dead.

26:20.240 --> 26:21.400
What?

26:22.520 --> 26:23.720
Scene two.

26:23.720 --> 26:26.120
Trace is with her attractive
younger lover, Jim Buckstar,

26:26.120 --> 26:28.480
played by Sonny-Sam Disco.

26:35.960 --> 26:39.080
Thank God that dog-faced
limey weasel

26:39.080 --> 26:41.960
is finally out of the picture, darling.

26:41.960 --> 26:43.600
Here's to us, baby.

26:44.680 --> 26:48.520
I have big plans for making
millions of dollars

26:48.520 --> 26:50.880
by selling the hospital!

26:50.880 --> 26:52.240
I know you do.

26:53.720 --> 26:57.600
It's part of a long-term plan
for world domination.

26:57.600 --> 27:01.560
Can you imagine, the whole
Trace Willoughby phenomenon

27:01.560 --> 27:04.600
bigger than we've ever dreamed of.

27:04.600 --> 27:07.360
I think I'd like an apartment
in Paris...
