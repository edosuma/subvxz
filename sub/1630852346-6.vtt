-[Echo] Are there any police on our tail?
-No! We lost 'em.

00:36.411 --> 00:39.122
And the hauler's cloaked
so they won't be able to find us.

00:39.205 --> 00:41.916
What about Moray's super-powered
bad dudes? Are they gone?

00:42.375 --> 00:44.627
I said, we're clear.

00:44.711 --> 00:46.129
[scoffs] Well, I don't know.

00:46.212 --> 00:48.798
They could have reverse X-ray goggles,
or whatever.

00:48.882 --> 00:50.800
Wouldn't those just be regular glasses?

00:50.884 --> 00:54.137
Hey, would you knuckleheads
stop yelling in my ear?

00:54.220 --> 00:55.722
-We got away.
-Ugh!

00:56.639 --> 00:59.851
Wow! So this is
the inside of a spy hauler!

01:00.226 --> 01:03.605
It's like an RV and a tank had a baby,

01:03.688 --> 01:07.525
then that baby grew up,
and fell in love with a command center,

01:07.609 --> 01:09.402
and they had another baby.

01:09.861 --> 01:11.905
This is that baby.

01:11.988 --> 01:14.866
Uh... Yeah. Sure.

01:14.949 --> 01:17.494
Hey, maybe we could
take this thing on tour!

01:17.577 --> 01:20.538
We could reenact
that luchador show we just put on.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.040
I'm gonna talk to my manager.

01:22.457 --> 01:24.584
Tuco, that wasn't a show. That was real.

01:24.667 --> 01:27.837
And your manager is the guy who framed us,
and was using you.

01:28.129 --> 01:28.963
Come again?

01:29.047 --> 01:32.133
Your old friend Moray
was using Tuco's wrestling match as cover.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.010
He's building a tunnel under the arena.

01:34.344 --> 01:35.762
Tunnels? What for?

01:35.845 --> 01:37.138
And I was right.

01:37.222 --> 01:41.768
I mean, not about the tunnel stuff,
but Tuco wasn't working with Moray! So ha!

01:42.227 --> 01:44.479
Well, actually he was, just not knowingly.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.022
Still kinda right.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.874
Sorry. Sometimes I forget about
my powers of stealth.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.458
Look, after some meditating,

02:48.042 --> 02:50.879
and ideating,
I decided our mission is changed.

02:50.962 --> 02:54.132
Ms. Nowhere was right.
This Moray is up to something.

02:54.549 --> 02:57.719
He's cunning,
always planning, always thinking,

02:57.802 --> 03:00.013
a deadly apex predator.

03:00.430 --> 03:04.559
So, we're on Ms. Nowhere's side again?
Should we call up the authorities?

03:04.976 --> 03:08.897
We can't. This is a mission
our superiors would never approve.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.733
-[rock music plays]
-We're going rogue.

03:12.233 --> 03:13.067
[gasps]

03:13.151 --> 03:14.235
What changed your mind?

03:14.319 --> 03:17.071
The fact that Tony saved you?
Ms. Nowhere calling you names?

03:17.155 --> 03:20.658
No. It was something else,
something deeper.

03:20.742 --> 03:24.203
-[stirring music plays]
-Sometimes you gotta feel it, in here.

03:24.287 --> 03:27.665
Someday, when I'm gone,
your guts will talk to you too.

03:28.124 --> 03:30.084
Promise me you'll listen.

03:30.668 --> 03:31.836
Yes, sir.

03:31.920 --> 03:32.837
We promise.

03:33.338 --> 03:36.132
Good! Now pull
all the agency files on Moray.

03:36.215 --> 03:38.760
I'll be chasing down
some leads in the field.

03:38.843 --> 03:39.969
And when I get back...

03:40.470 --> 03:42.764
we're going out for ice cream together.

03:42.847 --> 03:44.849

03:52.482 --> 03:55.735
We've got six international fugitives,
a professional luchador,

03:55.818 --> 03:57.779
and an attack dog inside that hauler.

03:57.862 --> 04:01.532
They're armed and extremely dangerous,
and it's up to us to take them in.

04:01.616 --> 04:03.493
Now let's crack that sardine can!

04:04.410 --> 04:07.789
Oh, my back. [groans]
I think I landed on a basketball.

04:07.872 --> 04:10.416
[muffled] It's not a basketball.
That's my head!

04:10.500 --> 04:15.129
Oh no! I can't feel my leg!

04:15.213 --> 04:16.923
[Tuco] Uh, that's my leg.

04:17.590 --> 04:18.424
Oh. Right.

04:19.008 --> 04:21.678
[groaning] Okay. I'm gonna try to get up.

[gasps] This is it, man,
we're gonna be tossed in jail!

04:38.486 --> 04:40.029
[groans, bones crack] Get a grip!

04:40.113 --> 04:43.825
It's gonna take a lot more than a saw
to get through that armor.

04:43.908 --> 04:45.868
We can survive in here for years.

04:46.577 --> 04:49.998
[groans] Years? Ms. Nowhere,
there's a madman out there right now!

04:50.081 --> 04:53.001
Moray's digging tunnels and
planning on destroying Mexico City.

04:53.084 --> 04:54.085
We don't have years!

04:54.168 --> 04:57.672
Uh, also, the bathroom's locked,
so that's gonna be an issue.

04:58.298 --> 05:00.425
But we also need to stop the madman.

05:02.927 --> 05:04.929
I'm getting hot. Whew!

05:05.013 --> 05:07.974
Is the air conditioning out? [gasps]

05:08.057 --> 05:10.560
I feel like the air conditioning's out,
huh? No?

-[sawing grows louder]
-Is anyone else sweating? [gasping]

05:13.479 --> 05:16.149
And that sawing! It's so loud!

-I can't take it!
-[banging]

05:18.776 --> 05:21.529

-No!

05:30.079 --> 05:32.040
[groans] How did we get
into this situation?

05:32.623 --> 05:35.251
[groans] Let me guess.
Somehow it's my fault.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.629
[sarcastically] I know.
I'm just always thinking about myself.

05:39.172 --> 05:42.300
I'm sorry for what I said.
I was wrong, and reacted without thinking.

05:42.383 --> 05:46.429
Exactly! You always react without thinking
and you're usually wrong!

05:46.512 --> 05:50.058
Whoa! I thought us luchadores
knew how to trash-talk!

05:50.141 --> 05:50.975
[exclaiming]

05:51.059 --> 05:53.019
-Whoa.
-Now what?

05:53.603 --> 05:57.065
[laughs] That's just
your standard-issue weapons-grade C-4.

05:57.148 --> 05:58.441
How do you know that?

05:58.524 --> 06:01.110
The way the aftershock
rattles your molars.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.405
The smell of burnt almonds
lingering in the air.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.323
[sniffs]

06:05.406 --> 06:09.077
Try doubling the payload, you house cats!

06:09.160 --> 06:12.288
Okay, maybe just
cool it with the attitude.

06:12.371 --> 06:15.208
Really? This coming from
the princess of sass?

06:15.541 --> 06:18.169
If I'm the princess, you're the queen.

06:18.252 --> 06:20.838
[exclaims] Are you calling me old?

06:20.922 --> 06:25.343
[groans] I'm saying, if you and the agency
hadn't been so hard on Moray 15 years ago,

06:25.426 --> 06:28.262
then maybe we wouldn't be
in this mess right now!

06:28.346 --> 06:30.181
Pressure makes diamonds!

06:30.264 --> 06:33.935
Besides, we're here because of
this big oaf running his mouth.

06:34.018 --> 06:37.480
Loose lips sink ships, Mr. Ocelot King!

06:37.563 --> 06:39.857
Hey! Uncle Tuco is innocent!

06:39.941 --> 06:43.111
It's true. Tuco was never asked
to be a spy and keep secrets.

06:43.194 --> 06:44.862
But you were!

06:44.946 --> 06:48.491
Whoa! Bro, I only told those secrets
to Tuco because he's family,

06:48.574 --> 06:49.659
so that doesn't count.

06:49.742 --> 06:52.912
Yes it does! Do you think
I would ever tell Sissy my secrets?

06:52.995 --> 06:56.999
She has no idea where I stash my Yoka,
and never will!

06:57.583 --> 07:00.753
[hesitatingly] Actually, she got that
out of me two months ago.

07:01.754 --> 07:02.588
[groans]

07:02.672 --> 07:05.842
Bro, you don't know what it's like
to be interrogated by her,

07:05.925 --> 07:08.511
and her army of princess ponies,

07:08.594 --> 07:12.765
and their intense, unblinking,
beady little eyes.

07:12.849 --> 07:15.143
-[groans] Why do I tell you anything?
-[banging]

07:15.226 --> 07:18.729
-Oh, I see! So everything's all my fault?
-I'm just stating facts.

07:18.813 --> 07:22.608
Plus, I'm really hot,
and that banging is driving me crazy!

07:23.151 --> 07:26.863
-Well, what's driving me crazy, is that--
-[Layla] Hey! [grunts]

07:26.946 --> 07:29.198
You wanted to drive around
with Layla, not me!

07:29.282 --> 07:30.950
I guess she's your best friend now?

07:33.411 --> 07:36.330
You know what? You're all useless!

07:36.414 --> 07:39.417
There's only one person
who can get us out of this mess.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.334
Roscoe.

07:40.418 --> 07:42.503
[licking, whining]

07:43.087 --> 07:44.380
Roscoe's a dog.

07:53.139 --> 07:55.808
After my little rendezvous
with Palindrome yesterday,

07:55.892 --> 07:57.435
I think they're on our side now.

07:57.518 --> 07:59.437
Roscoe will find them
and bring them to us.

07:59.520 --> 08:02.607
-[banging continues]
-That idea is, um...

08:02.690 --> 08:05.026
Stupid? This dog hasn't been trained.

08:05.109 --> 08:08.779
Who needs training when
you have his kind of animal instincts?

08:08.863 --> 08:10.406
Roscoe, sit.

08:15.453 --> 08:19.415
There's no way out of the hauler,
even if we wanted to do that stupid plan.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.334
See? Stupid.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.586
Well at least
I'm trying to think of something.

[Palindrome] Excuse me.
What happened here?

08:38.059 --> 08:39.227
What happened?

08:39.310 --> 08:41.896
My act was stolen, that's what happened.

08:41.979 --> 08:45.358
I thought the Ocelot King and I
were friends, but no!

08:45.441 --> 08:47.568
He's off working a routine
with somebody else!

08:48.069 --> 08:48.986
Who?

08:49.070 --> 08:51.113
I don't know. A whole team.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.866
Four masked wrestlers
appeared out of nowhere,

08:53.950 --> 08:56.285
and you know what the worst part was?

08:56.369 --> 08:58.829
It was a pretty good performance.

08:59.288 --> 09:03.209
Maybe even better than
our cat and butterfly chase!

09:03.292 --> 09:04.544

I know everyone's upset,
but I'm about to cheer you up!

09:53.259 --> 09:54.635
I found a way out!

09:54.719 --> 09:57.138
[Frostee] See that vent?
It doesn't use electricity.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.098
It's kind of like a fire sprinkler.

09:59.181 --> 10:01.392
When smoke hits the trigger, it pops open.

10:01.892 --> 10:03.769
Okay, but where's the smoke?

10:04.312 --> 10:05.605
Right here.

10:05.688 --> 10:09.025
When I mix these together,
it'll create a smoke bomb.

10:09.108 --> 10:11.110
We'll have to hold our breath for a bit,

10:11.193 --> 10:13.779
but then we can pop out
and escape through the sewers.

10:14.363 --> 10:15.823
But what if it doesn't work?

10:15.906 --> 10:17.867
The hauler will fill with smoke.
We'll die.

10:17.950 --> 10:20.620
Uh, well, I, uh, hm...

10:20.703 --> 10:24.165
[hesitatingly] Yeah, I guess that is
a good point about dying.

that has a 50% chance of killing us?

12:20.322 --> 12:24.160
No. I made a small generator
out of some copper wires and magnets,

12:24.243 --> 12:26.287
and I got DJ Drone to work!

Hey. I want to tell you
that I am really sorry about earlier.

13:39.026 --> 13:40.402
What I said was dumb.

13:40.486 --> 13:43.197
And I never thanked you
for coming back for us at the arena.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.157
You're rubbing off on me, Toretto.

13:45.241 --> 13:50.287
Plus, jumping into crazy situations
is a lot more fun than running from them.

didn't think it was gonna be this soon.

when he fought the Great Potoo
at the Vaso Vaso Vaso Arena?

16:10.844 --> 16:14.640
[Tuco] No! Did he give up when
he wrestled at El Gato Grande Park?

16:15.099 --> 16:20.062
No! Not even when he was blindsided
by a folding chair to the kidneys!

were your wrestling matches held?

16:34.243 --> 16:36.078
Well, there was one right here.

Okay, I don't need the play-by-play.

There was a match here, here, and here.

are next to banks,

as cover for the tunnels he was digging.

He's targeting these buildings!

17:14.199 --> 17:16.785
