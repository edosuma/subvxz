00:15.140 --> 00:18.601
This is a big night for me. I finally did
something on my own and it paid off.

00:18.685 --> 00:20.353
That's why things
got fucked up in the past,

00:20.437 --> 00:23.148
'cause of fucking Julian and Bubbles.
I finally got myself learnt.

00:23.231 --> 00:25.859
If you want something done right,
you get it done by your own.

00:26.025 --> 00:29.279
-Well, we helped a bit too, Ricky.
-Yeah man, we totally had your back, dude.

00:29.362 --> 00:31.322
Will you shut the fuck up?
Can't you see I'm talking here?

00:31.406 --> 00:33.366
Anyway, I got this
incredible backdoor deal

00:33.450 --> 00:36.453
with one of the dispensaries in Halifax.
Cash money.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.663
I'm done, I finally fucking did it.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.667
Julian and Bubbles are probably going
to be a little pissed off at first but...

00:42.751 --> 00:44.794
I'm just gonna throw a massive party
and that'll fix it.

00:44.878 --> 00:46.045
Parties fix everything.

00:46.129 --> 00:48.047
[rock music]

00:48.256 --> 00:50.425
[Ricky] Okay, boys.
Just up here past this treeline.

00:50.508 --> 00:52.510
When we get there,
no talking, no fucking around.

00:52.594 --> 00:54.596
We get the plants cut down
as fast as we fucking can

00:54.679 --> 00:57.182
and get out of here before that
cock-sucking sun comes up, okay?

00:57.265 --> 00:59.976
-[Cory] Hells, yeah.
-[Jacob] Don't worry. We got this, Ricky.

01:00.060 --> 01:02.187
Thanks for bringing us
to the harvest, eh?

01:02.270 --> 01:03.980
-[thud]
-What the fuck was that?

01:04.063 --> 01:05.857
-Is that the fucking cops?
-[Jacob] Cops?

01:05.940 --> 01:07.400
[click, gunshot]

01:07.484 --> 01:10.070
-[man] Surprise!
-[Ricky] Fuck! Jesus Christ! Fuck!

01:10.820 --> 01:12.989
It's just a shotgun, boys.
Get the fuck up, you pussies!

01:13.073 --> 01:15.033
-Come on!
-[Cory groaning]

01:15.116 --> 01:16.618
-Oh, dude...
-[engine revving]

01:16.701 --> 01:19.204
[Ricky] What the f...
Get back here! Fuck you!

01:19.287 --> 01:22.207
What the fuck you doing?
Oh, my fuck!

01:22.290 --> 01:23.500
No!

01:24.125 --> 01:25.293
No!

01:26.044 --> 01:28.379
Oh, my fucking God!

01:29.297 --> 01:31.299
Guess I shouldn't be fucking surprised.

01:31.925 --> 01:34.093
Hermit crab whore bitches!

01:34.302 --> 01:39.182
Why does God and the rest of the world
keep fisting me up the fucking ass?

01:39.265 --> 01:41.476
-[gunshots]
-Fuck! Fuck!

01:41.559 --> 01:45.230
[theme music]

02:24.269 --> 02:25.854
Oh, hey, fellas.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.230
What's going on?

02:27.313 --> 02:29.149
Check out the new set-up.

02:29.232 --> 02:31.901
Check this out,
I sold my pizza sauce recipe

02:31.985 --> 02:34.445
to that fucked guy
with the weird accent.

02:34.529 --> 02:37.282
Reinvested every penny into making beer.
Look at this.

02:37.365 --> 02:38.408
[giggles]

02:38.491 --> 02:40.451
Started off slow,
but I'm making some...

02:40.535 --> 02:43.121
fucking decent money at it now.
Look at that.

02:43.204 --> 02:45.165
Green Bastard IPA.

02:45.248 --> 02:47.167
Selling a ton of that
to people in the park.

02:47.250 --> 02:48.585
Business is booming.

02:48.918 --> 02:51.629
It's booming, but I am under
some fucking pressure today.

02:51.713 --> 02:53.840
Ricky's making some kind
of major announcement.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.425
He's throwing a big party.

02:55.508 --> 02:57.260
I've got to get
this whole batch bottled up

02:57.343 --> 02:59.387
because he ordered 20 two-fours.

02:59.804 --> 03:03.224
So it must be big fucking news.
I am pumped!

03:04.183 --> 03:05.184
Hey, Bubs.

03:05.268 --> 03:06.561
[Bubbles] Hey, Julian.

03:06.644 --> 03:08.521
How's the beer business
treating you, buddy?

03:08.605 --> 03:10.982
Oh, it's fucking amazing.
It's fucking amazing.

03:11.065 --> 03:13.526
Lot less work than hauling
shopping carts and all.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.403
Here, bend over.
I'll take your temperature.

03:15.486 --> 03:16.613
[laughter]

03:16.696 --> 03:18.281
It's good that people
are digging it, man.

03:18.364 --> 03:20.158
-Yes, sir.
-You know what, I've been thinking.

03:20.241 --> 03:22.994
Why don't you make a beer
with my fucking name on it, and face?

03:23.077 --> 03:25.747
Yeah, I might be able to.
Might be able to.

03:25.830 --> 03:27.332
Maybe make a protein beer.

03:27.415 --> 03:29.542
-Call it Muscle Man.
-[sarcastic laugh]

03:29.626 --> 03:30.919
-That's real funny.
-Get it?

03:31.002 --> 03:34.088
So, what are your sales like, man?
Are you making a profit or what?

03:34.547 --> 03:36.257
-My sales?
-Yeah.

03:36.341 --> 03:38.885
My sales are fucking great, actually,
Julian.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.137
I see where this is going.

03:41.304 --> 03:42.931
-Where?
-I see where this is... Well,

03:43.014 --> 03:44.849
Bubbles is making money now.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.809
-Bubbles is making money...
-[Julian sighs]

03:46.893 --> 03:50.021
So Julian's all of a sudden
very interested in the beer business.

03:50.104 --> 03:51.981
-Bubs, don't be an asshole.
-Let me guess.

03:52.065 --> 03:53.983
-What?
-You wanna be part of it now, too.

03:54.067 --> 03:56.361
I just wanna make
sure you're doing the right thing here

03:56.444 --> 03:57.695
and nobody's ripping you off, okay?

03:57.779 --> 04:00.573
Do you know the valuation
of your company? Huh?

04:00.657 --> 04:01.574
[sighs]

04:01.658 --> 04:04.077
Do you know your profit margins
on your sales each week?

04:04.160 --> 04:06.871
Look, don't try
to Michael Wekerle me, bud.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.706
Okay? I watch Dragon's Den too.

04:08.790 --> 04:11.084
I know all these fucking
terms you're using.

04:11.793 --> 04:12.877
[sighs]

04:13.253 --> 04:15.421
Bubs, I'm fucked.

04:16.297 --> 04:18.466
I'm broke, man.
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

04:19.132 --> 04:20.843
I-I'm trying to go legit here, man,

04:20.927 --> 04:23.263
but I'm finding it very, very hard.

04:23.638 --> 04:27.558
I had movie night last night with a chick.
She had to buy the fucking popcorn.

04:27.642 --> 04:29.769
Do you know how embarrassing that is?

04:29.852 --> 04:31.354
Well, I told you.

04:31.437 --> 04:33.815
You shouldn't be going to the movies.
It's a fucking rip-off.

04:33.898 --> 04:35.733
Bubs, I was watching a movie
in my trailer.

04:35.817 --> 04:38.403
I couldn't afford
fucking microwave popcorn.

04:38.486 --> 04:40.613
-Like, this is bad, man.
-Oh, my God.

04:40.697 --> 04:42.615
-I don't know...
-Julian, that's... Here.

04:42.699 --> 04:44.200
Just take that.
That's pathetic.

04:44.284 --> 04:47.662
-I don't want your charity.
-Well, you need my charity, obviously.

04:47.829 --> 04:49.539
Can't afford fucking popcorn.

04:49.622 --> 04:50.915
You got another one of these?

04:50.999 --> 04:52.333
-No, I got that one!
-[Ricky] Bubs!

04:52.417 --> 04:54.669
-And you should appreciate it.
-You got a Band-Aid, man?

04:54.752 --> 04:57.255
I can't get this donkey slut whore
of a cut to stop bleeding!

04:57.338 --> 04:58.715
-It's driving me fucking nuts.
-Ricky!

04:58.798 --> 05:01.301
What in the fuck did you do to your arm?

05:01.884 --> 05:03.720
Uh... well...

05:03.928 --> 05:05.471
That fucking girlfriend of yours.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.098
Finally tried to do you in, did she?

05:07.181 --> 05:08.349
[scoffs]

05:09.225 --> 05:11.352
I've been dating this girl Susan
for four or five months,

05:11.436 --> 05:12.645
-it's been fucking great.
-[treadmill squeaking]

05:12.729 --> 05:15.732
I actually forgot how much I missed
having someone to share everything with.

05:15.815 --> 05:18.067
She is a bit hard
to deal with at times, but...

05:18.151 --> 05:21.195
the fucking sex is the best
I've ever had in my life. Like, insane!

05:21.279 --> 05:24.115
Like, it's so nuts
that I've got to get back in shape.

05:24.198 --> 05:27.368
I didn't realize how out of fucking
shape I was till I started banging her.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.954
This fucking thing
is not fucking helping me!

05:31.080 --> 05:32.290
Come on...

05:32.623 --> 05:34.542
[treadmill whirring erratically]

05:37.170 --> 05:38.504
[grunt]

05:38.588 --> 05:39.756
[powering down]

05:43.968 --> 05:45.845
Part of me is really happy for Ricky.

05:45.928 --> 05:49.015
I think it's good, and I think
he needs a girlfriend in his life.

05:49.098 --> 05:52.477
But, to be honest,
she scares me a little bit.

05:52.560 --> 05:55.605
And by a little bit,
I mean massively.

05:55.688 --> 06:00.151
And I don't like the way she controls
his mind without him even realizing it.

06:00.234 --> 06:02.653
MKUltra styles.

06:03.905 --> 06:08.576
Jesus fuck, Ricky, look at this thing!
That is a nasty cut!

06:08.659 --> 06:11.454
-How in the fuck did you do this?
-[exhales]

06:11.537 --> 06:14.916
Well, me and Cory and Jacob
were roller... blade skating, actually.

06:14.999 --> 06:17.794
It was a fucking good time. And we're
flying along, and all a sudden, boom!

06:17.877 --> 06:20.630
Hit this patch of ground, and we go down.
We went down fucking hard.

06:20.713 --> 06:23.925
Jacob got the worst of it. It was... fuck.
They shouldn't be allowed to make gravel!

06:24.008 --> 06:26.302
It's just not good for roller blade
skating, let me tell you.

06:26.385 --> 06:28.846
Yeah, "roller blade skating"?
That's what you were doing?

06:28.930 --> 06:32.683
How and where would you guys even get
fucking roller blades, first of all?

06:32.767 --> 06:34.393
Obviously, you stole them.

06:34.727 --> 06:36.395
Ah! No. No, we didn't steal them.

06:36.479 --> 06:38.731
We got them at the, uh...
What's that new store?

06:38.815 --> 06:40.525
The I Rent Everything
the guy opened up, or...

06:40.608 --> 06:42.777
Fucking great idea buddy had.
Holy shit.

06:42.860 --> 06:44.904
-The I Rent Everything store?
-[Trinity] Dad?

06:44.987 --> 06:48.116
Why the fuck are there ball bearings
in Jacob's chest?

06:48.199 --> 06:49.951
-What happened last night?
-[Bubbles] What?

06:50.034 --> 06:52.370
[Ricky] Those aren't ball berries,
they're fucking pieces of gravel

06:52.453 --> 06:54.330
from the roller blade
skating accident we had.

06:54.413 --> 06:57.041
[Trinity] Nice fucking try.
Tell me the truth!

06:59.877 --> 07:02.130
[Bubbles] Those are from
a fucking shotgun shell.

07:02.213 --> 07:05.299
Those are from a shotgun shell.
You got fucking shot again, Ricky!

07:05.383 --> 07:07.051
[Trinity] Don't fucking lie to me.

07:07.343 --> 07:10.054
Okay, you know what?
Trin? Boys?

07:10.263 --> 07:12.348
I'm fucking sorry, I've been keeping
a secret from you guys

07:12.432 --> 07:13.641
the whole fucking summer.

07:13.724 --> 07:16.394
I wasn't upgrading my Small
Engine Repair Certificanation

07:16.477 --> 07:20.106
and I wasn't taking that fucking crane
operator's course I told you about.

07:20.398 --> 07:22.775
I was secretly
growing dope by myself

07:22.859 --> 07:25.278
in the woods down
by Billy Bastard's Bluff.

07:25.653 --> 07:26.654
Dad...

07:26.904 --> 07:29.866
Unbelievable, Ricky.
You fucking promised me!

07:29.949 --> 07:31.576
I know! I'm sorry!

07:31.659 --> 07:32.827
-But, I mean...
-[chuckle]

07:32.910 --> 07:35.830
It was fucking amazing. I developed this
new sativa strain with the head grower

07:35.913 --> 07:38.374
from that medical marijuana
place in Moncton. Fucking incredible!

07:38.458 --> 07:40.251
-Yeah...
-Had irrigation, 75 plants.

07:40.334 --> 07:42.420
It was fucking beautiful!
Some of them were eight feet high!

07:42.503 --> 07:44.589
-It was amazing!
-Don't give a fuck, Ricky.

07:44.672 --> 07:47.216
I had a one shot,
back door cash deal.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.760
Was gonna happen today.
I would have been fucking done for life.

07:49.844 --> 07:50.887
Don't give a fuck.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.346
I don't give a fuck.

07:52.430 --> 07:55.808
Last night it all went to shit. And yes,
I did take Jacob and Cory with me.

07:55.892 --> 07:58.269
That's on me. But it wasn't supposed
to go down like that.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.396
When we got there
to fucking cut down the plants,

08:00.480 --> 08:02.940
there were these other guys
and they fucking stole all my weed

08:03.024 --> 08:04.317
and they shot us.

08:04.400 --> 08:06.486
You are unbelievable!

08:06.569 --> 08:10.490
How could you take my husband,
your son-in-law, on a job like that?

08:10.823 --> 08:13.242
Well, he did want to go.
He didn't have to.

08:13.326 --> 08:15.995
He... Oh yeah, it's his fault.
He wanted to go.

08:16.078 --> 08:19.248
What if he wanted to fucking shove
a rutabaga up your arse, Ricky?

08:19.332 --> 08:21.792
-Would you let him?
-I don't even know what that is.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.836
Why would you do this, man?
And without us?

08:23.920 --> 08:26.005
-You guys could have been fucking killed.
-You know what, boys?

08:26.088 --> 08:28.257
I was this fucking close to being retired.
This fucking close!

08:28.341 --> 08:31.135
I'm gonna find out who stole the weed
and fucking kill them!

08:31.219 --> 08:34.429
No, you're not!
It's over. The weed is gone.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.724
Leave it.
I should have fucking known.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.768
I should have known
that the big announcement

08:38.851 --> 08:42.063
was gonna have something to do
with illegal bullshit, Ricky.

08:42.145 --> 08:43.856
Every fucking time.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.442
No, that's... that's not what
the big... huge...

08:46.526 --> 08:48.611
announcement's gonna be at all.
It's something totally different.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.238
Bigger than a fucking
tiny little drug deal.

08:50.321 --> 08:53.449
Okay. Okay. So there's still
a big announcement, is there?

08:53.533 --> 08:55.451
And you still need all that beer?

08:55.535 --> 08:56.577
Yes, I do.

08:56.661 --> 08:58.746
Big fucking announcement
coming down the pipe.

08:58.829 --> 08:59.914
Huge. It's...
You're gonna...

08:59.997 --> 09:02.959
Big announcement
still coming, everybody!

09:03.292 --> 09:05.002
Big announcement!

09:05.086 --> 09:09.382
-It better be a fucking doozy, Ricky.
-It's gonna be a fucking major doozy.

09:09.966 --> 09:11.884
You're so full of shit, man.

09:16.013 --> 09:18.015
[Jim] We're finally
getting out today.

09:18.099 --> 09:21.060
You know, I hate this fucking
despicable shit hole!

09:23.229 --> 09:25.398
Randy and I got nothing now.

09:25.481 --> 09:29.068
We'll be starting over
from scratch, but... that's okay.

09:29.151 --> 09:31.195
'Cause at least we won't be in here.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.781
At least we'll have each other.

09:34.490 --> 09:37.827
I love my Randy,
my beautiful Randy.

09:37.910 --> 09:39.954
The time in here
has helped Mr. Lahey and I

09:40.037 --> 09:41.706
get closer than
we ever have been.

09:41.789 --> 09:44.458
I don't think our love
has ever been stronger.

09:44.542 --> 09:48.796
I just hope he's okay in the head
when we get out, that's all.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.216
[door opening]

09:52.592 --> 09:55.011
[Randy] What do you want, Ted?
We're free men now?

09:57.138 --> 09:58.180
[door shuts]

09:58.431 --> 10:02.435
[Ted] Rumour has it that you're going
to try and make things difficult for me.

10:02.602 --> 10:04.812
[Jim] Well, the truth will
set you free, Ted.

10:04.895 --> 10:06.981
[Ted] I'm gonna bet you won't.

10:07.064 --> 10:08.983
In fact, I'm gonna bet you 50 grand.

10:09.066 --> 10:09.984
[soft thud]

10:10.067 --> 10:13.112
That's for you screw-ups.

10:13.195 --> 10:15.615
-Some "shut the hell up" money.
-[unzipping bag]

10:17.033 --> 10:19.285
That $400K we busted you guys with
was supposed to go

10:19.368 --> 10:22.663
to the Crown Attorney under
the Proceeds of Crime Act.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.875
And it would have been locked up
in an evidence room forever.

10:25.958 --> 10:28.252
That didn't make sense to me.

10:28.336 --> 10:30.004
Now, I'm not George Green.

10:30.087 --> 10:32.256
Our department
needed computers

10:32.340 --> 10:35.676
and forensics equipment,
and a new cruiser.

10:35.760 --> 10:37.511
Let's just say
I made sure that...

10:37.595 --> 10:40.264
that money stayed
with the police station.

10:40.806 --> 10:44.644
So, that just leaves you two jackasses
as loose ends.

10:45.686 --> 10:47.772
So, are we good here?

10:47.855 --> 10:50.066
Or am I gonna have
to fake some charges

10:50.149 --> 10:53.319
and keep you two pea-brains
in here a little longer?

10:53.402 --> 10:55.905
Oh, thanks a lot, Ted. We're more
than good. Right, Mr. Lahey?

10:55.988 --> 10:57.948
-Right, Randy.
-[zipping up bag]

10:58.032 --> 11:00.451
[Ted] You understand that
this is hush money.

11:00.534 --> 11:02.662
So not a goddamn word.

11:02.745 --> 11:05.414
Or I'm going to destroy your lives.

11:07.667 --> 11:09.126
[electronic beep]

11:09.210 --> 11:12.922
[man on PA] Cell six. No beating off.
Terry, this is your last...

11:13.005 --> 11:14.215
[door closing]

11:15.591 --> 11:16.884
Look at this fucking thing!

11:16.967 --> 11:19.470
I built this by my fucking self.
Like, check it out.

11:19.553 --> 11:21.263
I've got a wicked kitchen set-up.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.183
I've got my bedroom here,
a nice flat screen TV.

11:24.266 --> 11:27.269
Like, get the fuck in and check that out.
It's fucking amazing!

11:27.978 --> 11:29.271
All right, and come back here.

11:31.899 --> 11:34.151
I got my downstairs
bathroom here.

11:34.693 --> 11:36.821
Got a bit of a bar in the trunk there.

11:36.904 --> 11:37.863
And this is fucking wicked.

11:37.947 --> 11:41.117
I built this for Moe for when he wants
to sleep over. He fucking loves it!

11:41.367 --> 11:42.410
All right.

11:43.035 --> 11:46.330
Now check this upstairs out.
This is fucking badass.

11:47.039 --> 11:48.999
Look at this fucking patio!

11:49.083 --> 11:52.420
I got a couple recliners here,
blaster, TV...

11:52.503 --> 11:54.880
fucking nice lamp.
I made that myself.

11:54.964 --> 11:58.175
A little stool for Jacob because
he doesn't need much, he's fucked.

11:58.259 --> 12:01.345
And if you get too banged up
up here, got a nice fucking urinal.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.889
You can piss right here, like this,

12:03.973 --> 12:07.226
and it runs right down the hose
into the fucking downstairs bathroom.

12:07.518 --> 12:08.436
What do you think?

12:08.519 --> 12:11.147
Like, I am living
like a fucking king!

12:11.230 --> 12:12.857
[Cory] Dude, this deck is awesome!

12:12.940 --> 12:15.067
I love it up here.
It's so badass.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.403
Yeah, Ricky,
it really is incredible.

12:17.486 --> 12:18.988
I know how fucking great it is, okay?

12:19.071 --> 12:21.449
I built the fucking thing.
I know how awesome it is!

12:21.991 --> 12:24.243
But back to the big announcement.
It's gotta be something huge

12:24.326 --> 12:26.454
or I'm going to come across
like I'm a fuck dummy.

12:26.537 --> 12:29.498
Why don't you tell everyone you're dead?
That's big, man.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.585
But Cory, there's a problem with that,
see... I'm not dead, right?

12:32.668 --> 12:34.378
See where I'm going with this?

12:35.671 --> 12:37.339
What if you were
running for President?

12:37.423 --> 12:38.966
There's nothing huger than that.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.968
That's brilliant, Jacob.
Really believable,

12:41.051 --> 12:43.304
that I'm gonna run for
fucking President of Canada!

12:43.679 --> 12:45.723
Okay, whatever it is,
it has to be something huge

12:45.806 --> 12:48.476
and you gotta come in on...
like, with something big.

12:48.559 --> 12:50.686
-[coughing]
-You mean like a dump truck or something?

12:50.769 --> 12:51.937
Because that would be cool.

12:52.021 --> 12:52.980
Yeah, dude.

12:53.063 --> 12:55.107
Why the fuck did I even ask you
two cock slingers to help?

12:55.191 --> 12:57.693
-You're too fucked!
-Oh, how about an animal?

12:58.319 --> 13:01.405
Yeah, man. Hey, something exotic.
Like a snow tiger.

13:02.114 --> 13:03.532
You know what, an animal...

13:03.616 --> 13:05.493
-[Jacob coughs]
-...might fucking do it.

13:05.576 --> 13:06.827
But a fucking snow tiger, seriously?

13:06.911 --> 13:09.455
Where the fuck am I gonna get
a snow tiger around here?

13:09.538 --> 13:11.332
It needs to be, like, an animal.
Something big.

13:11.415 --> 13:13.125
But something we could get,
like, locally.

13:13.209 --> 13:15.294
Got it. Steakmaker.

13:15.794 --> 13:17.338
Yeah-h-h!

13:17.421 --> 13:19.423
What the fuck is a steakmaker?

13:19.507 --> 13:22.384
He means a cow. A lot of people
are calling them that these days.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.136
Who? Who the fuck
calls them that?

13:24.220 --> 13:26.430
People that are fucked in the head,
that's who.

13:28.182 --> 13:30.809
Oh, my fuck. I've got it!
You were fucking close, too!

13:31.602 --> 13:33.854
Something with four legs, eats grass

13:33.938 --> 13:34.980
and lives on a farm.

13:35.064 --> 13:36.482
Spider.

13:36.649 --> 13:40.110
No, not a fucking spider. A spider has
ten legs. A fucking hornse!

13:40.194 --> 13:42.196
-Think about it, a hornse! It's beautiful!
-Nice!

13:42.279 --> 13:43.781
Where did you even come up with that?

13:43.864 --> 13:45.366
Don't know.
Just popped in my fucking head.

13:45.449 --> 13:48.452
What if it was a gift for Susan? That
would make the announcement even bigger!

13:48.536 --> 13:51.497
Dude, what if it was
an engagement gift for Susan?

13:51.580 --> 13:53.624
That makes the announcement
even bigger-bigger!

13:53.707 --> 13:56.418
But I'm not fucking engaged to Susan,
you fucking ass hamsters, am I?

13:56.502 --> 13:58.629
Yeah, but if you tell people you are,
they'll believe you.

13:58.712 --> 14:00.839
Imagine if you came in
on an engagement horse.

14:00.923 --> 14:04.593
Even better if you put a fake horn on that
shit, it's an engagement unicorn horn.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.845
Du-u-ude!
That's fucking awesome!

14:07.304 --> 14:09.765
You know what, boys?
It's fucking perfect.

14:09.848 --> 14:13.477
I mean, not the unicorn shit.
That is completely fucked, Cory!

14:14.103 --> 14:16.188
But that would be a big
fucking announcement.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.440
A fucking engagement hornse.

14:27.283 --> 14:28.409
Holy shit!

14:28.492 --> 14:30.411
This changes everything, Mr. Lahey!

14:30.494 --> 14:33.664
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, not so fast,
Ran-Ran-Bodingo-Man!

14:33.747 --> 14:35.624
Don't forget,
when we go back to the park,

14:35.708 --> 14:37.877
Julian's gonna try to kill us.

14:38.794 --> 14:41.046
Look, this money might be
the answer to everything.

14:41.130 --> 14:45.009
We could offer it to Julian.
Maybe he'd wipe the shit slate clean.

14:45.092 --> 14:46.510
Seriously, sir?

14:46.886 --> 14:49.680
Never forget it's Julian's fault
our lives are so frigged up.

14:49.763 --> 14:51.599
-That's true.
-They did this to us.

14:51.682 --> 14:53.893
And they didn't have to go to jail.
We did.

14:54.310 --> 14:57.313
That's a very good point,
my sexy little Ran-Man.

14:57.396 --> 14:59.899
Well... what if we offered him
half the money?

14:59.982 --> 15:02.192
Look, we'd still have enough money
to live comfortably

15:02.276 --> 15:04.069
for a long, long time, Randers.

15:04.153 --> 15:05.529
What do you think, bud?

15:06.238 --> 15:07.406
You're right.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.033
And then we'd have peace.

15:09.116 --> 15:10.910
-Right.
-And a nest egg.

15:11.577 --> 15:14.038
But we can never tell anybody
about the money. You promise?

15:14.121 --> 15:16.457
-I promise.
-We'd never be safe, Mr. Lahey.

15:16.540 --> 15:18.459
-That's a deal.
-[kiss]

15:19.668 --> 15:21.337
We should stop at the King.

15:24.798 --> 15:26.926
-[engine starting]
-[Ricky] That's right,

15:27.009 --> 15:29.929
go pick some fucking carrots.
Or whatever the fuck it is you do.

15:31.138 --> 15:32.348
You idiots ready?

15:34.475 --> 15:36.143
Okay, go time, go time.

15:37.853 --> 15:39.855
-Jesus Christ...
-[Cory] Sorry, dude!

15:46.820 --> 15:48.530
Get the fuck in there.
Go, go, go, go.

15:54.161 --> 15:56.497
Oh, yeah.
This fucking thing right here.

15:56.580 --> 15:59.208
Look at the fucking paint job on this
thing's fur! It's beautiful!

15:59.291 --> 16:00.334
It's awesome.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.752
-All right.
-[latch clicking]

16:01.835 --> 16:03.587
Let's get it the fuck out of here.

16:05.214 --> 16:07.174
[whistling softly, snapping fingers]

16:07.424 --> 16:08.968
It's not moving, dude.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.844
Well, fucking make it move.

16:10.928 --> 16:12.638
-How do we make it move?
-[whistling softly]

16:12.721 --> 16:14.640
You get in behind it and push.
Cory, you pull.

16:14.723 --> 16:17.434
Come on, let's get this going, boys!
We've got to get out of here!

16:17.518 --> 16:19.311
-Are you...
-I'm not sure that's a good idea.

16:19.395 --> 16:21.438
I heard you're not supposed
to stand behind a horse.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.482
Shut the fuck up!
No talking, okay?

16:23.565 --> 16:25.317
-Okay.
-Jacob, you push. Cory, you pull.

16:25.401 --> 16:27.528
-I'll help you, come on. Jacob!
-[horse whinnying]

16:27.611 --> 16:30.489
Push harder! Punch it in the fucking ass!
Show it who's boss!

16:30.572 --> 16:32.366
-[high-pitched whinny]
-[loud thud]

16:32.449 --> 16:34.076
-Ahh!
-Fuck, fuck, fuck!

16:34.159 --> 16:35.160
Fuck!

16:35.244 --> 16:37.329
-Fuck, shit...
-It fucking hurts, boys.

16:37.413 --> 16:40.541
Okay. I'm fucking sorry, Jacob, but man,
you're gonna have to get the fuck up.

16:40.624 --> 16:42.626
We've got to get out of here.
Are you okay?

16:42.710 --> 16:46.088
I don't think I am. Something's wrong
with my neck. It's fucking killing me.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.841
Fuck, fuck, fuck! Sorry, man!
Cory, you help him.

16:48.924 --> 16:50.676
I'll get the fucking hornse.
But once again, boys,

16:50.759 --> 16:53.345
I'm wondering why the fuck I brought you
two cock lanterns on this!

16:53.429 --> 16:54.722
Fuck's sakes!

16:54.805 --> 16:56.056
[moaning]

16:56.223 --> 16:58.559
[Cory] Dude, man, that was just like
the Kool-Aid man.

16:58.642 --> 17:00.686
Except, like, way worse and shit

17:00.769 --> 17:02.396
because he knew
what he was doing.

17:02.479 --> 17:03.731
Oh my God...

17:04.356 --> 17:06.650
[Jacob] Oh my God, guys,
I need to go to the hospital here.

17:06.733 --> 17:09.278
My neck's really fucking killing me.
Something's wrong.

17:09.361 --> 17:13.073
Jacob, chill the fuck out, okay?
It's probably just got a cank in it.

17:13.156 --> 17:15.576
I'd be more worried about your ribs.
That horse kicked the fuck out of you.

17:15.659 --> 17:17.493
Those are probably broken for sure.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.664
Nothing you can do for broken ribs,
so fuck going to the hospital.

17:21.248 --> 17:23.333
You guys hungry?
I'm fucking starving.

17:23.416 --> 17:25.794
[moaning]

17:27.463 --> 17:29.715
Got Ricky's beer all bottled
and ready to go.

17:29.798 --> 17:32.968
I've got time now to make
a few deliveries for some extra cash.

17:33.052 --> 17:36.597
Did you get a good shot of the truck?
Make sure you get a good shot of it.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.265
Look, I've got the cape there.

17:38.348 --> 17:41.477
Got the speakers, just like
a little ice cream truck but for beer.

17:42.102 --> 17:44.271
You know, the beersman.
Going awesome.

17:44.354 --> 17:46.482
Donnie's been my number one customer.

17:46.940 --> 17:49.568
Some people think this beer's
a little bit strong, but...

17:50.069 --> 17:51.528
Fuck, Donnie seems to...

17:51.612 --> 17:53.906
-Oh, for fuck's sakes!
-[Donnie screaming]

17:53.989 --> 17:55.199
Jesus!

17:55.282 --> 17:57.201
[Donnie] Are you fucking kidding me?

17:57.284 --> 18:00.579
I just had that fucking
thing re-gravelled!

18:00.662 --> 18:02.289
Donnie, calm down.

18:02.372 --> 18:04.583
I'll give you a free case
to make up for it.

18:04.666 --> 18:07.086
Oh, you're fucking right, you will!

18:07.169 --> 18:09.004
And you tell fucking Ricky

18:09.088 --> 18:11.882
I want those fucking
chicken fingers replaced

18:11.965 --> 18:15.010
-he took last Friday...
-Donnie, fucking relax.

18:15.094 --> 18:18.722
-Are you coming to the party?
-I don't fucking know yet!

18:20.140 --> 18:21.475
Okay, bud.

18:22.601 --> 18:26.563
Can you imagine, going around
being that fucking angry all the time?

18:26.647 --> 18:29.024
He's gonna pop a blood vessel
in his head.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.822
Fuck's sakes!

18:36.198 --> 18:38.700
Hey, guys.
Hey, can you give us a break?

18:38.784 --> 18:41.203
We just got home. We're trying
to get our shit together here.

18:41.286 --> 18:43.997
-Yeah, frig off, guys!
-All right.

18:44.081 --> 18:45.541
[tires squealing]

18:46.458 --> 18:47.960
[car door opening]

18:48.043 --> 18:49.753
It's about fucking time!

18:49.962 --> 18:52.548
I've been waiting a long
goddamn time for this.

18:52.631 --> 18:54.883
-Take it easy, Julian.
-Dreamin' of... You take it easy!

18:54.967 --> 18:56.260
Calm down, we just wanna talk.

18:56.343 --> 18:58.262
No, I wanna talk to you
two fucking assholes!

18:58.345 --> 18:59.888
-Listen, Julian...
-Randy, I'll handle it.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.599
Julian, a lot of crazy, crazy shit
went down there.

19:02.683 --> 19:05.102
Yeah, because of you
two drunken fucking lunatics!

19:05.185 --> 19:07.187
-Yeah, well...
-You ruined my fucking life!

19:07.271 --> 19:09.398
Randy and I are willing
to take full responsibility, Julian.

19:09.481 --> 19:10.899
Oh, you're taking full responsibility,
all right.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.109
Yeah, because we feel terrible.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.903
But we think we have a plan
to make it all up to you.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.072
-[scoffing]
-Jim, shut the fuck up.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.283
I'm calling the shots here.

19:19.366 --> 19:23.453
-You took us for $400,000!
-Right.

19:23.537 --> 19:25.247
So this is what's gonna happen.

19:25.330 --> 19:28.208
I'm taking half your wages
for the rest of your fucking life

19:28.292 --> 19:30.335
-until you pay me back.
-Rest of our lives?

19:30.419 --> 19:33.380
You're lucky I don't fucking kill you
right now, Randy!

19:33.797 --> 19:35.174
Are we clear?

19:35.257 --> 19:37.176
-Y... yeah.
-Good!

19:38.844 --> 19:40.179
Wait a minute, Julian.

19:40.262 --> 19:42.681
Calm down, it's just crazy talk,
it's not fair.

19:42.764 --> 19:43.974
Fuck you, Randy.

19:44.057 --> 19:46.101
Just hear us out,
we got a very generous offer...

19:46.185 --> 19:47.644
Ra... Ra... Randy!

19:47.728 --> 19:49.396
Julian's given us his terms.

19:50.105 --> 19:52.608
Thank you, Julian!
Sorry, bud!

19:56.153 --> 19:57.446
[car drives off]

19:58.822 --> 20:00.657
[Tyrone] Yo, what up, what up,
what up, y'all?

20:00.741 --> 20:02.993
Hope y'all having a good time.
Make some noise out there!

20:03.076 --> 20:04.203
[cheering]

20:04.286 --> 20:06.788
Yeah, y'all rocking with us, yo.
Hope y'all having a good time.

20:06.872 --> 20:08.415
Yo, make some noise
for my man, Ricky.

20:08.498 --> 20:11.043
-[cheering]
-[Ricky] Thanks, boys.

20:12.169 --> 20:13.795
How the fuck's
everyone doing today?

20:13.879 --> 20:16.006
-[cheering]
-Right on.

20:16.089 --> 20:18.133
Well, today is a monument-alous
occasion for me

20:18.217 --> 20:20.302
and that's why I wanted everybody here.

20:20.385 --> 20:21.970
How's everybody fucking doing?

20:22.054 --> 20:23.680
[cheering]

20:23.764 --> 20:25.390
You ready for the big
fucking announcement?

20:25.474 --> 20:26.475
[cheering]

20:26.558 --> 20:28.769
All right. Cory, Jacob, you're on.
It's time.

20:30.687 --> 20:32.022
Check out this fucking thing.

20:32.105 --> 20:34.816
Oh, my fuck!
Are you joking, Ricky?

20:34.900 --> 20:37.611
That's the big announcement?
You got a fucking horse?

20:37.694 --> 20:39.446
-[horse neighing]
-Well, it's not for me, Bubs.

20:39.529 --> 20:41.365
Isn't she beautiful?
What a beautiful hornse.

20:41.448 --> 20:43.450
Or is it a...
Does it have a cock, boys?

20:45.327 --> 20:46.995
Yeah, dude, it's got a huge one.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.872
[Ricky] Actually, I guess it's a he, so...

20:48.956 --> 20:52.501
Anyway, today, I want to give
this beautiful hornse

20:52.584 --> 20:55.754
to the love of my life, Susan,
and I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

20:55.837 --> 20:57.089
So thanks again, everybody,
for coming.

20:57.172 --> 20:59.591
-[Bubbles] What?
-What the fuck is he doing?

20:59.675 --> 21:02.719
Oh my fuck, Julian, this is bad.
This is bad!

21:02.803 --> 21:04.638
[Marguerite]
What's the matter with you?

21:04.721 --> 21:07.432
You don't need a fucking horse,
you five-star dummy!

21:07.516 --> 21:10.894
If she loves you and she wants
to marry you, God help her,

21:10.978 --> 21:13.021
you don't need a fucking horse
or anything else.

21:13.105 --> 21:15.649
[Bubbles] Ricky, get the fuck
down here right now!

21:15.732 --> 21:17.693
-Get down here.
-What's up, Bubs?

21:18.402 --> 21:21.530
-Well, what are you fucking doing?
-What do you mean?

21:21.613 --> 21:24.408
You're getting enga...
Are you out of your fucking mind?

21:24.491 --> 21:27.911
You guys don't even fucking like
each other. You can't get married.

21:28.412 --> 21:31.665
Like, all you do is fight
and fucking bang.

21:31.748 --> 21:35.711
And like, why would you even need
this thing if you're getting engaged?

21:36.169 --> 21:37.963
Great idea, boys.
A fucking big animal.

21:38.046 --> 21:39.715
Great one!
Fuck, you guys...

21:39.798 --> 21:41.508
Take this fucking thing
back to the far...

21:41.591 --> 21:43.510
the horse store. Right the fuck now.
Get going!

21:43.593 --> 21:44.594
-[Cory] Okay.
-Nice one!

21:44.678 --> 21:46.513
Let's go, dude.
Watch out. Watch out, dude.

21:46.596 --> 21:49.891
It's a beautiful horse,
but I mean, Ricky... Jesus Murphy!

21:49.975 --> 21:54.313
You know what, though, Bubs, like...
I really do think that I love her enough.

21:54.771 --> 21:56.273
And you know what they say,
you know,

21:56.356 --> 21:58.442
good, hard, heavy banging
should cancel out

21:58.525 --> 22:00.652
hard heavy arguing and fighting, right?

22:00.736 --> 22:03.572
Ricky, who in the fuck says that?
Who says that?

22:03.655 --> 22:04.740
Okay, you know what...

22:04.823 --> 22:07.576
Maybe a hornse was a bit much,
gifty-wise, whatever.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.870
Just wanted to show my future wife
how much I loved her

22:09.953 --> 22:13.457
so I wanted it to be big, but... I guess
the real big news here is the engagement.

22:13.540 --> 22:14.624
Right?

22:15.417 --> 22:17.794
[sighing] I guess. I guess it is, Ricky.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.005
Congratulations,
I don't know....

22:20.088 --> 22:22.132
I just want you to be happy,
but that's fucked.

22:22.215 --> 22:23.342
Yeah, me too, bud, but...

22:24.176 --> 22:25.886
Here she is now, everyone!
Thanks again for coming!

22:25.969 --> 22:27.262
-[Susan] Where is he?
-[Ricky] Hey babe!

22:27.345 --> 22:30.682
[Susan] Oh, there he is! There's
the whore hopping cock gobbler!

22:30.766 --> 22:35.353
You dirty fucking low-down lying bastard,
fucking prick!

22:35.437 --> 22:37.939
You motherfucker!
Where did you catch it, huh?

22:38.023 --> 22:42.194
From one of these rabie-pussy,
fucking trashy trailer sluts?

22:42.277 --> 22:44.654
Well, who are you calling a trailer slut?

22:44.738 --> 22:46.615
-Susan, Susan...
-You want to bring it?

22:46.698 --> 22:47.908
Just calm the fuck down, please.

22:47.991 --> 22:50.202
What the fuck are you talking about?
Catch what?

22:50.285 --> 22:52.704
Catch what?
Catch fucking what?

22:52.788 --> 22:55.665
-Chlamydia! Is catch the fuck what!
-[crowd gasping]

22:55.749 --> 22:58.043
I'm kicked out of my fucking house
because of you!

22:58.126 --> 23:01.671
You gave me an STD,
you fucking piece of shit,

23:01.755 --> 23:06.343
you cheating, rotten, fucking shit-infused
whore magnet.

23:06.426 --> 23:08.053
We are fucking done!

23:08.136 --> 23:10.138
Fuck you! Fuck you!

23:10.222 --> 23:12.516
Susan, hold the fuck on here.
You listen the fuck to me right now.

23:12.599 --> 23:14.893
I didn't bang anybody else.
Why would I? I love banging you!

23:14.976 --> 23:16.436
-Oh!
-And you're fucking living with someone?

23:16.520 --> 23:17.771
What are you, married?

23:17.854 --> 23:20.690
No, not exactly but 16 fucking years,
Ricky.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.734
What the fuck, Susan?

23:22.818 --> 23:25.278
I thought we fucking loved each other
or some shit here.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.364
I was actually gonna ask you
to fucking marry me today.

23:27.447 --> 23:30.784
-That's why everyone's here.
-[laughing]

23:30.867 --> 23:33.745
Marry you? I'm fucking...
Marry you? Look at you!

23:33.829 --> 23:36.164
We were having an affair,
you dumb dick.

23:36.248 --> 23:40.961
It was low-down, good, dirty fucking sex
and then you fucked it all up

23:41.044 --> 23:43.880
and ruined my fucking life,
you dirty fucking slut.

23:43.964 --> 23:46.591
All right, that's e-fucking-nough!
You don't have to fucking hit Ricky

23:46.675 --> 23:49.427
-just because you have an STD!
-Oh, right? So was it you?

23:49.511 --> 23:51.763
Yeah, it was fucking me,
you stupid whore!

23:51.847 --> 23:54.432
[mixed screaming]

23:58.812 --> 24:01.231
Susan, I didn't fucking sleep
with someone else.

24:01.314 --> 24:04.484
So it is impossible that I gave it to you.
You must have banged someone else!

24:04.568 --> 24:07.487
Oh, fucking classic, Rick! Turn it around
on me like you always do.

24:07.571 --> 24:10.615
You know what, you are so fucked.
You're fucking stupid.

24:10.699 --> 24:13.285
You're fucking overweight.
You dress like a fucking idiot.

24:13.368 --> 24:15.120
You wanna know why, Ricky?

24:15.912 --> 24:18.832
-Why?
-Because you're a fucking loser.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.500
Fuck you, Ricky LaFleur.

24:21.168 --> 24:23.587
You suck my fucking cock!

24:23.670 --> 24:25.922
[sobbing, indistinct yelling]

24:26.006 --> 24:27.966
Ricky, just let her fucking go.

24:28.049 --> 24:30.343
-It's for the best, buddy.
-[Susan] Oh, you fucking suck it!

24:30.427 --> 24:31.720
[Marguerite] You're better off
without her.

24:31.803 --> 24:33.680
-You all right?
-Yep, I'm fine.

24:33.763 --> 24:35.682
You all right?
Let's smoke a joint...

24:35.765 --> 24:37.309
Smoke a joint, get drunk.
Come on, man.

24:38.935 --> 24:39.978
Ricky...

24:40.645 --> 24:42.272
[voice shaking]
No. Uh, I'm good.

24:42.898 --> 24:45.233
-[tires squealing]
-[Susan] Fucking piece of shit!

24:45.317 --> 24:47.861
-[music playing]
-[Bubbles] Jesus, she is wild.

24:47.944 --> 24:50.030
-She's fucking crazy.
-[Ricky] God fucking damn it,

24:50.113 --> 24:52.532
I'll just bend over again,
and you can fucking decide

24:52.616 --> 24:54.701
what you want
to shove in me this time!

24:55.410 --> 24:57.829
-Let's get the party going again...
-[cheering]

24:57.913 --> 25:00.665
-Everybody. That was...
-[Ricky] ...God's little fuck toy!

25:03.168 --> 25:06.504
And what do you think,
my sweet little goddess of liquor?

25:07.172 --> 25:09.925
You know, you have no idea
how much I've missed you.

25:10.342 --> 25:11.593
What's that?

25:13.053 --> 25:14.888
I totally agree!

25:14.971 --> 25:16.848
Why'd you pansy out, Mr. Lahey?

25:16.932 --> 25:19.267
You should never have
accepted those terms.

25:19.351 --> 25:22.771
Giving up half of our wages
is way more than 25 grand.

25:22.854 --> 25:23.980
It's frigging ridiculous!

25:24.064 --> 25:27.234
You're just not seeing it, my beautiful
Ran-Ran-Thank-You-Man.

25:27.317 --> 25:31.947
Sit down! Look, me and the liquor,
we've got it all figured out, bud!

25:32.197 --> 25:36.952
It's gonna take a long time
for Julian to rack up $25,000

25:37.035 --> 25:38.578
from our wages, right?

25:38.662 --> 25:43.333
So meanwhile, we can take the 25 that we
were going to give that beautiful bastard,

25:43.833 --> 25:46.086
and we can double or triple it.

25:46.169 --> 25:48.046
We just treat it like play money.

25:48.880 --> 25:51.007
What are you talking about?
How do we double or triple it?

25:51.091 --> 25:52.467
Horse track, baby!

25:52.550 --> 25:56.638
We just sit back and we let
the liquor choose our horses!

25:56.721 --> 25:58.974
They've got a great canteen at the track.

25:59.307 --> 26:01.768
Haven't changed
the grease in years.

26:02.519 --> 26:04.521
[calculator clicking]

26:04.604 --> 26:06.773
Well, as fucked as today was,

26:07.232 --> 26:11.569
I actually didn't do too fucking bad.
I'm surprised.

26:11.653 --> 26:14.322
Just means I've got to sell
more beer tomorrow, I guess.

26:14.406 --> 26:15.949
-That's not too bad.
-[footsteps]

26:16.032 --> 26:19.119
Hey, buddy. Listen man,
can I borrow a few beer off you?

26:19.202 --> 26:20.287
I've got Skyler coming over.

26:20.370 --> 26:22.247
She doesn't drink rum,
she wants fucking beer.

26:22.330 --> 26:25.375
So that's my...
Skyler's my fucking problem now?

26:25.458 --> 26:27.210
That's a nice wholesome name, too,
Julian.

26:27.294 --> 26:29.045
Where'd you meet her,
at the church rally?

26:29.129 --> 26:30.964
Do you got any fucking beer for me?

26:31.047 --> 26:32.966
-Obviously I have beer!
-Okay, all right, thank you.

26:33.049 --> 26:35.677
-But the shit's not free to fucking make.
-No shit.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.846
-It still costs money. There's six.
-Bubs.

26:37.929 --> 26:39.973
-Chill out, I'll get you the fuck back.
-Chill out?

26:40.056 --> 26:42.142
Well, how long do you plan
on fucking living like this?

26:42.225 --> 26:43.810
It's just a few fucking beer, man!

26:43.893 --> 26:46.313
Oh, yeah, it's a few beer
and then it's this...

26:46.396 --> 26:49.149
Hey, boys. I ran out of whisky.

26:49.482 --> 26:51.359
Any chance you guys can lend me
20 bucks for booze?

26:51.443 --> 26:54.154
Need to get fucked out of my head,
I'm only about quarter of the way.

26:54.237 --> 26:55.530
Sorry, bud. I got nothing.

26:55.613 --> 26:58.867
And I'd get drunk with you tonight,
but I got a chick coming over. So...

26:58.950 --> 27:01.786
It's cool. I kinda wanna be by myself
right now anyway.

27:01.870 --> 27:03.872
Bubs, could you help me out, please?

27:03.955 --> 27:07.751
Jesus Christ's sweaty fucking balls,
you guys are fucked!

27:07.834 --> 27:09.836
Both of youse.
Look out, Ricky.

27:10.545 --> 27:11.713
Look out.

27:12.756 --> 27:15.091
Here. I'll give you a little bit of whisky

27:15.175 --> 27:17.260
'cause I do feel bad
for what happened to you today.

27:17.344 --> 27:18.845
That was fucked.

27:18.928 --> 27:20.638
But I think it's for the best.

27:20.972 --> 27:23.558
I really do.
[exhaling]

27:23.641 --> 27:25.268
Boys, I've got to fucking...

27:25.894 --> 27:28.646
get something off my chest here
that's been building.

27:29.064 --> 27:31.524
It's been building
and I can't take it anymore.

27:35.070 --> 27:38.031
Okay, listen. I'll start off
by saying I love you guys, okay?

27:38.281 --> 27:39.866
I always have and I always will.

27:39.949 --> 27:42.035
-Love you too, buddy.
-Yeah, me too. What the fuck's up?

27:42.118 --> 27:46.664
Just shut the fuck up! Shut your big
muscular lips and listen for once.

27:47.165 --> 27:48.666
I've got the floor.

27:49.417 --> 27:52.754
Now this might sting a bit, boys,
but it needs to be said.

27:52.837 --> 27:55.799
Have you guys looked
in the fucking mirror lately?

27:56.174 --> 27:59.427
Have you really looked in the mirror,
like, went right up close

27:59.511 --> 28:01.429
and looked at yourself in the mirror?

28:01.513 --> 28:04.349
I haven't. I don't like getting too
close to mirrors. They fucking scare me.

28:04.432 --> 28:06.434
Feel like they're going to suck me
right in or something.

28:07.060 --> 28:10.480
Well, you should do it, Ricky,
because it's fucking time to grow up.

28:10.563 --> 28:13.441
Especially you two,
'cause we are getting fucking old, boys.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.443
We're getting old,
and we're getting out of shape

28:15.527 --> 28:17.529
and we're getting shitty looking.

28:18.530 --> 28:21.116
We're getting shitty looking
and you're not getting any younger,

28:21.199 --> 28:22.158
but what are you doing?

28:22.242 --> 28:25.036
You're breaking the law
like you're fucking 17 years old.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.080
Nothing's changing.

28:27.163 --> 28:29.124
And who's benefiting from it?
Nobody.

28:29.207 --> 28:31.626
Well, I almost benefited today.
I was almost fucking retired,

28:31.709 --> 28:33.628
-when you think about it.
-You shut up too, Ricky,

28:33.711 --> 28:34.921
because you're not retired.

28:35.004 --> 28:37.298
That's the fucking point
I'm trying to make.

28:37.507 --> 28:39.801
You're not retired, and you shouldn't
have been fucking...

28:39.884 --> 28:42.262
lying to us about growing dope.
That is bullshit.

28:42.345 --> 28:43.513
That was bullshit, man.

28:43.596 --> 28:46.099
I know, I'm sorry, it was dumb.
I should have told you guys.

28:46.182 --> 28:47.809
You should have fucking told us!

28:47.892 --> 28:50.145
This is a fucking wake-up call
right now, boys.

28:50.729 --> 28:52.021
I'm telling you,

28:52.105 --> 28:54.357
because I'm already gone legit.

28:54.858 --> 28:56.735
I've got legit things going on.

28:58.611 --> 29:00.780
And you guys, I know
how you fucking operate.

29:00.864 --> 29:04.576
You've got no money now. You're broke,
and I know what that turns into.

29:04.993 --> 29:08.371
The next thing you know,
you're gonna be in jail forever.

29:08.455 --> 29:11.166
You're gonna wind up in there
for the rest of your lives.

29:11.332 --> 29:15.962
Fucking in there, all alone,
dying, looking shitty.

29:17.172 --> 29:19.883
And when you're in there taking
your last fucking breaths, Ricky,

29:19.966 --> 29:21.468
sucking in your last
breath on earth,

29:21.551 --> 29:25.680
there's gonna be no family there
and no Bubbles to hold your hand.

29:25.764 --> 29:28.391
-Come on, Bubs.
-Don't fucking "come on" me.

29:28.975 --> 29:30.393
It's true.

29:31.853 --> 29:35.231
Like, if you guys fucking loved me
as much as you say you do,

29:35.315 --> 29:38.401
then breaking the law
is over for good.

29:39.110 --> 29:40.945
That's it.
That's all I've got to say.

29:41.029 --> 29:43.990
I want you guys to fucking think
about that tonight.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.993
Here, Ricky, you can finish that off.

29:47.410 --> 29:49.204
Consider it thinkin' liquor.

29:55.627 --> 29:58.004
Do you got any ice or mixers?

29:59.672 --> 30:00.965
Thanks, buddy.

30:04.636 --> 30:06.638
Well, I hope you get banged, Julian.

30:07.222 --> 30:08.139
Thanks.

30:08.973 --> 30:11.226
[bottles clinking, ice rattling]

30:12.477 --> 30:15.605
[theme music]

30:55.979 --> 30:58.189
[seagulls squawking]

31:10.159 --> 31:14.080
[fish] Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

31:15.498 --> 31:18.251
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

31:21.212 --> 31:22.589
Fuck.

31:22.672 --> 31:24.883
-[light clicks off]
-[whispering] Fuck off.
