 the myth of a snowplow smash

 Cold-weather myths?

02:02.222 --> 02:05.222
 We do. It's time to do
 another Alaska special.

02:05.925 --> 02:06.925
 You got any ideas?

02:06.926 --> 02:08.860
 Well, as a matter of fact,
 there is one thing

02:08.862 --> 02:10.128
 that I'm kind of curious about.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.130
 It's a material called pykrete
 that a guy named Pyke invented

02:14.601 --> 02:16.168
 around World War I I.

02:16.169 --> 02:19.169
 And this was made
 of frozen wood pulp and water.

02:20.507 --> 02:22.508
 And supposedly it made a mix

02:22.509 --> 02:25.177
 that was harder than concrete
 when it froze.

02:25.178 --> 02:27.613
 And they were going to build
 an aircraft carrier out of it,

02:27.614 --> 02:30.282
 but they never got around to it
 'cause the war ended.

02:30.283 --> 02:31.750
 So as far as we know,

02:31.751 --> 02:34.419
 no one's ever tried to build
 a boat out of the stuff.

02:34.420 --> 02:35.587
 That's correct.

02:35.588 --> 02:37.089
 Until us.

02:37.090 --> 02:39.525
 Yeah.

02:39.526 --> 02:40.859
 NARRATOR:
 According to this myth,

02:40.860 --> 02:43.860
 in World War I I, with steel
 and iron in short supply,

02:44.564 --> 02:47.564
 an ingenious inventor came up
 with an entirely new concept --

02:48.902 --> 02:51.902
 pykrete, a mixture of ice
 and wood pulp

02:52.238 --> 02:55.238
 that was supposedly so tough,
 you could forge a fleet from it.

02:56.376 --> 02:59.376
 But before the Allies
 could build a frozen flotilla,

02:59.812 --> 03:02.812
 the war ended, leaving this
 mythical question unanswered.

03:03.816 --> 03:06.816
 Can you really build a boat out
 of nothing but sawdust and ice?

03:08.955 --> 03:11.955
 An aircraft carrier
 made of sawdust and ice.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.192
 I really hope we haven't bitten
 off more than we can chew here.

03:15.595 --> 03:17.896
 Well, ultimately,
 we are gonna have to build

03:17.897 --> 03:19.831
 some sort of boat
 out of pykrete.

03:19.832 --> 03:22.832
 But first I think we need to
 test its magical properties.

03:23.903 --> 03:24.903
 Such as?

03:24.904 --> 03:27.904
 Well, like its bulletproof,
 it is tougher than concrete,

03:29.442 --> 03:32.442
 and it takes longer than ice
 to melt, supposedly.

03:33.213 --> 03:35.347
 That sounds like
 a great plan of attack.

03:35.348 --> 03:37.349
 We'll test those properties
 here in San Francisco.

03:37.350 --> 03:39.051
 When we've got
 the information we need,

03:39.052 --> 03:41.653
 we head up north
 to launch a pykrete boat.

03:41.654 --> 03:42.821
 Yeah.

03:42.822 --> 03:44.056
 Good.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.658
 NARRATOR: It's a story that will
 ultimately see Adam and Jamie

03:46.659 --> 03:49.428
 attempt to sail
 the Alaskan fjords

03:49.429 --> 03:52.164
 in a beautiful pykrete boat.

03:52.165 --> 03:53.165
 It's getting worse.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.199
 NARRATOR:
 But before all that,

03:54.200 --> 03:57.200
 they're starting at the
 beginning by making the stuff.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.738
 The traditional recipe,

03:59.739 --> 04:01.840
 if there is such a thing,
 of pykrete

04:01.841 --> 04:04.841
 is that it should be 14 % by
 weight of sawdust or wood pulp,

04:07.280 --> 04:10.280
 and then 86 %, of course,
 by weight of water.

04:10.950 --> 04:12.985
 NARRATOR:
 Sounds simple, and it is.

04:12.986 --> 04:15.986
 Jamie mixes the wood pulp
 and water and, hey, presto.

04:16.789 --> 04:18.490
 This is pykrete.

04:18.491 --> 04:20.125
 Aircraft carriers, huh?

04:20.125 --> 04:21.726
 [ Chuckles ]

04:21.728 --> 04:24.663
 Who knew?

04:24.664 --> 04:27.432
 NARRATOR: The pykrete goes into
 the deep freeze to chill out

04:27.433 --> 04:30.433
 so the guys
 can take aim at this myth.

04:30.803 --> 04:33.803
 So, there are three mythical
 properties of pykrete --

04:33.806 --> 04:36.806
 that it melts slower than ice,
 that it's harder than ice,

04:37.110 --> 04:38.877
 and that it's bulletproof.

04:38.878 --> 04:41.878
 And, well, we couldn't resist
 testing the last one first.

04:43.182 --> 04:45.050
 So we've set up
 a mini-gun range,

04:45.051 --> 04:46.385
 and we're going to shoot
 a block of ice

04:46.386 --> 04:49.386
 and shoot a block of pykrete
 and see what the difference is.

04:49.889 --> 04:52.889
 NARRATOR: So for the first test,
 it's just plain ice.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.826
 That's pretty darn good.

04:54.827 --> 04:57.827
 NARRATOR:
 Versus a .45 caliber slug.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.298
 Shooting at ice.

05:09.942 --> 05:12.277

 Yep, closer inspection confirms

05:12.278 --> 05:14.846
 the bullet scored
 a clean strike.

05:14.847 --> 05:16.748
 [ Laughs ]

05:16.749 --> 05:19.749
 We've turned it
 into a snow cone.

05:20.286 --> 05:22.754

 the freshly frozen pykrete

05:22.755 --> 05:24.056
 withstand the same fate?

 In 3.. .2... 1.

 There you go.

05:36.636 --> 05:38.937
 That's bulletproof.

05:38.938 --> 05:40.972
 You weren't lying.

05:40.973 --> 05:42.407
 It's tough stuff.

05:42.408 --> 05:44.276
 NARRATOR:
 It certainly is.

05:44.277 --> 05:46.244
 Instead of shattering
 like the ice,

05:46.245 --> 05:48.347
 the bullet ricocheted
 off the pykrete,

05:48.348 --> 05:51.348
 taking only a shallow crater
 with it.

05:51.384 --> 05:53.051
 We don't only bust myths.

05:53.052 --> 05:54.519
 Sometimes we confirm stuff.

05:54.520 --> 05:56.722
 We were told
 that pykrete is bulletproof,

05:56.723 --> 05:59.723
 and [chuckles]
 it's definitively bulletproof.

06:02.495 --> 06:04.329
 NARRATOR:
 Well, it may be bulletproof,

06:04.330 --> 06:07.330
 but the pykrete
 isn't out of the woods yet.

06:07.734 --> 06:10.402
 Next up is
 the mechanical strength test,

06:10.403 --> 06:13.372
 and it's nothing
 if not straightforward.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.907
 I'm gonna go out on a limb here
 and say that you want to

06:15.908 --> 06:18.908
 put these 5-pound weights on
 one at a time until it breaks?

06:20.079 --> 06:22.714
 It's like
 I'm a freaking mind reader.

06:22.715 --> 06:25.083
 NARRATOR: And first
 they need to break the ice.

06:25.084 --> 06:26.551
 10 pounds.

06:26.552 --> 06:29.087
 -20 pounds.

 Oh!

 [ Laughs ]

06:32.191 --> 06:33.692
 41 pounds.

06:33.693 --> 06:35.360
 40 pounds, 1 ounce.

06:35.361 --> 06:38.361
 That was the straw
 that broke the camel's back.

06:38.598 --> 06:41.466
 NARRATOR: At 40 pounds,
 the ice shattered.

06:41.467 --> 06:43.835
 So how will the pykrete compare?

06:43.836 --> 06:46.836
 Pykrete, 5-pound weight.

06:47.607 --> 06:48.640
 There you go.

06:48.641 --> 06:50.442
 NARRATOR:
 Well, cue fast forward

06:50.443 --> 06:52.778
 because it's tougher
 than it looks.

06:52.779 --> 06:55.180
 And when the tally reaches
 300 pounds,

06:55.181 --> 06:56.815
 they run out of lead.

06:56.816 --> 06:59.816
 So Jamie adopts
 a more direct approach.

07:04.290 --> 07:07.290
 This is killing me!

07:11.864 --> 07:12.964
 Well, there you go.

07:12.965 --> 07:14.633
 -There's your problem.
 -I love this stuff.

07:14.634 --> 07:16.768
 NARRATOR:
 And Adam has every reason to.

07:16.769 --> 07:18.937
 The pykrete
 is nearly eight times

07:18.938 --> 07:21.938
 the breaking strength
 of the ice.

07:22.408 --> 07:25.408
 Hell's bells, Margaret,
 I am impressed with pykrete.

07:25.878 --> 07:27.846
 I would not have bet
 that it could withstand

07:27.847 --> 07:29.414
 all the lead we had in the shop.

07:29.415 --> 07:32.415
 I'm starting to think
 that we could have some fun

07:32.718 --> 07:35.718
 with this technology.

07:37.490 --> 07:40.490
 NARRATOR: Next,
 Kari, Grant, and Tory plow on.

07:43.029 --> 07:45.230
 The last time we did
 the Alaska special,

07:45.231 --> 07:47.632
 we got a lot of fans from Alaska
 writing in

07:47.633 --> 07:49.668
 saying we missed a classic myth.

07:49.669 --> 07:50.702
 Tell me more.

07:50.703 --> 07:53.004
 The myth is that a couple
 are driving down a road

07:53.005 --> 07:54.406
 on a dark, snowy night.

07:54.407 --> 07:55.474
 The visibility is horrible.

07:55.475 --> 07:58.009
 They swerve out of control,
 crash head on

07:58.010 --> 08:00.412
 into a parked snowplow
 on the side of the road.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.080
 But this is no ordinary crash.

08:02.081 --> 08:04.149
 Instead of just crumpling
 into a wreck,

08:04.150 --> 08:06.485
 the car splits
 all the way down the middle

08:06.486 --> 08:09.486
 from the front to the rear
 in a perfect bifurcation.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.090
 And both walk away
 from the crash.

08:12.091 --> 08:13.525
 Are you serious?

08:13.526 --> 08:14.693
 Yep.

08:14.694 --> 08:16.094
 Wow!

08:16.095 --> 08:19.095
 NARRATOR: It's a crazy crash
 concept that's "snow joke."

08:20.666 --> 08:23.666
 A car plows into a plow and is
 split right down the middle.

08:24.871 --> 08:27.871
 But could a snowplow
 really bifurcate a car?

08:28.808 --> 08:30.809
 It's a myth
 that's full of problems,

08:30.810 --> 08:32.644
 starting with this one.

08:32.645 --> 08:35.645
 For this myth we need to do some
 pinpoint-accurate crash tests

08:35.881 --> 08:38.482
 using cars
 smashing into snowplows.

08:38.484 --> 08:41.119
 But there are
 no crash-test facilities

08:41.120 --> 08:42.654
 that we can use in Alaska.

08:42.655 --> 08:44.956
 All right. So how are we
 gonna test this one?

08:44.957 --> 08:47.957
 Well, our researchers have come
 up with an amazing location.

08:48.694 --> 08:50.061
 It's beautiful.
 It's snowy.

08:50.062 --> 08:52.030
 It's in Wisconsin.

08:52.031 --> 08:55.031
 Well, ultimately,
 this is a great Alaskan myth,

08:55.568 --> 08:57.869
 but if we have to go
 to Wisconsin to test it,

08:57.870 --> 08:59.170
 then so be it.

08:59.171 --> 09:00.505
 All right,
 well, if that's the case,

09:00.506 --> 09:02.541
 I think the first thing
 we need to do when we get there

09:02.542 --> 09:03.708
 is look at some snowplows.

09:03.709 --> 09:05.510
 Let's face it,
 we're from California.

09:05.511 --> 09:08.013
 What do we know about snowplows?

09:08.014 --> 09:10.348
 NARRATOR: In an odd start
 for the Alaska special,

09:10.349 --> 09:13.349
 the team
 head to Wisconsin instead.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.288
 TORY:
 Ooh, there it is.

09:16.289 --> 09:18.089
 Snowplow nirvana.

09:18.090 --> 09:21.090
 NARRATOR: Now, it isn't Alaska,
 but with plows aplenty,

09:21.494 --> 09:24.494
 Burke's Trucks
 is the perfect place to start.

09:24.897 --> 09:27.799
 KARI: We may not have crab
 fishermen walking around here,

09:27.800 --> 09:29.467
 we can't see Russia
 from our back porch,

09:29.468 --> 09:31.670
 and there's no moose
 freely walking the streets.

09:31.671 --> 09:34.671
 But what we do have here
 is a lot of snow and snowplows.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.910
 And that's our first step.
 We got to get us one of those.

09:38.911 --> 09:40.412
 NARRATOR:
 And that's a process

09:40.413 --> 09:43.214
 bringing back bad memories
 for Grant.

09:43.215 --> 09:46.215
 So last time we used a snowplow,
 it was a cursed item.

09:46.218 --> 09:48.787
 There was a curse
 of the snowplow.

09:48.788 --> 09:49.821
 This time,

09:49.822 --> 09:52.822
 I fell down immediately
 after getting out of the car.

09:52.892 --> 09:55.694
 This does not bode well.

09:57.496 --> 10:00.398
 was a myth cursed
 from beginning to end.

10:00.399 --> 10:02.067
 [ Tires screeching ]

10:02.068 --> 10:04.603
 But that's not
 what's bothering Tory.

10:04.604 --> 10:07.604
 I'm not so concerned about the
 curse as I am about these plows.

10:08.107 --> 10:09.975
 For this to be
 even remotely possible

10:09.976 --> 10:12.077
 to get one of these cars
 to split,

10:12.078 --> 10:14.145
 we're going to need
 a wedge-shaped plow.

10:14.146 --> 10:15.614
 NARRATOR:
 Tory's got a point.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.283
 These flat scoops
 are miles off the myth.

10:18.284 --> 10:20.185
 But after hunting
 high and low...

10:20.186 --> 10:22.587
 [ Laughs ] It turned on.

10:22.588 --> 10:23.922
 Shut it off.
 Turn it off.

10:23.923 --> 10:24.923
 TORY: Nothing.

10:24.924 --> 10:27.924
 NARRATOR:
...the team strikes gold.

10:30.296 --> 10:33.296
 TORY: Now, that is the plow
 we're looking for!

10:33.566 --> 10:36.101
 GRANT: Dude, if anything
 is gonna split that car,

10:36.102 --> 10:37.936
 it's got to be this.

10:37.937 --> 10:40.937
 Not only does it have
 this sharp ax edge,

10:41.073 --> 10:43.708
 but it's got this really thin
 blade right in front,

10:43.709 --> 10:46.645
 which is just like presenting
 a knife edge to a car.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.413
 And that's exactly what we need

10:48.414 --> 10:50.815
 to split our car
 right down the middle.

10:50.816 --> 10:52.784
 NARRATOR: And there's more
 behind this plow

10:52.785 --> 10:54.285
 than just the blade.

10:54.286 --> 10:55.854
 KARI:
 The great thing about this

10:55.855 --> 10:57.956
 is not only do we have
 this magnificent blade,

10:57.957 --> 10:59.924
 but we have this huge weight
 of a truck behind it,

10:59.925 --> 11:01.760
 which means the car
 is going to be hitting

11:01.761 --> 11:04.062
 a completely immovable force,

11:04.063 --> 11:07.063
 basically hitting
 a giant immobile ax.

11:07.166 --> 11:10.166
 NARRATOR:
 Immobile ax is right.

11:12.438 --> 11:15.438
 NARRATOR: During World War I I,
 the engineer Geoffrey Pyke

11:15.675 --> 11:18.675
 imagined a flotilla
 of iceberglike ships

11:18.911 --> 11:20.745
 made only from pykrete.

11:20.746 --> 11:23.746
 But would a boat made from wood
 pulp and ice have stayed afloat,

11:24.483 --> 11:27.483
 or was this idea just dead wood?

11:29.088 --> 11:31.890
 Well, the Mythbusters
 are finding out,

11:31.891 --> 11:34.859
 putting pykrete
 through a trial by fire.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.662
 And sure as heck,
 it is bulletproof.

11:37.663 --> 11:40.663
 NARRATOR: And so far
 it's living up to the claims.

11:40.733 --> 11:43.733
 But Jamie sees some room
 for improvement.

11:45.171 --> 11:46.604
 JAMIE:
 The reason the pykrete is strong

11:46.605 --> 11:49.605
 is because of the overlapping
 fibers of these wood chips.

11:50.076 --> 11:53.076
 Now, the reason that
 it actually breaks under shock

11:53.345 --> 11:56.081
 is that the fibers
 are not terribly long.

11:56.082 --> 11:58.917
 And so they can break apart
 relatively quickly.

11:58.918 --> 12:01.918
 So what other kind
 of cellulose products do we have

12:03.289 --> 12:05.490
 that maybe would be superior?

12:05.491 --> 12:07.092
 NARRATOR:
 And there's your answer.

12:07.093 --> 12:10.093
 Newspaper.
 Lots of newspaper.

12:10.129 --> 12:13.129
 In "Phonebook Friction,"
 the Mythbusters found out

12:13.132 --> 12:16.132
 just how much force
 two interleaved phonebooks

12:16.302 --> 12:17.368
 could withstand.

12:17.369 --> 12:18.703
 This is like a sickness!

12:18.704 --> 12:20.405
 NARRATOR:
 And it's that layered strength

12:20.406 --> 12:22.607
 that Jamie is hoping
 to capitalize on

12:22.608 --> 12:25.343
 with his own new brand
 of pykrete.

12:25.344 --> 12:28.313
 JAMIE: What if we saturate
 something like that with water

12:28.314 --> 12:29.614
 and freeze it?

12:29.615 --> 12:32.217
 We might have something,
 say, like plywood

12:32.218 --> 12:35.218
 instead of particle board,
 and plywood is stronger.

12:35.755 --> 12:38.755
 NARRATOR: The newspaper is more
 or less the same old wood pulp,

12:39.391 --> 12:40.992
 just different form.

12:40.993 --> 12:42.861
 So how will it compare?

12:42.862 --> 12:44.863
 Okay, the last few pounds.

12:44.864 --> 12:47.365
 NARRATOR:
 Just like the classic pykrete,

12:47.366 --> 12:50.366
 the super pykrete
 supports 300 pounds of lead.

12:50.503 --> 12:53.503
 But even after a beating,
 it doesn't crack under pressure.

12:55.741 --> 12:58.209
 Here, wait a second.

12:58.210 --> 13:01.210
 Dude, I'm gonna go out on a limb
 and say I like this material.

13:02.915 --> 13:04.048
 Okay.

13:04.049 --> 13:06.785
 I'm literally out on a limb.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.887
 Yeah, I got it.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.855
 NARRATOR:
 But before they set sail,

13:10.856 --> 13:13.525
 there's arguably
 the most vital question.

13:13.526 --> 13:14.959
 Will it melt?

13:14.960 --> 13:17.896
 And for that,
 Jamie whips up these.

13:17.897 --> 13:18.897
 Perfect.

13:18.898 --> 13:21.232
 NARRATOR: Like an ice-cube tray
 on steroids,

13:21.233 --> 13:23.501
 these molds will ensure
 that the boys end up

13:23.502 --> 13:26.502
 with three identical,
 small-scale boats for testing.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.973
 JAMIE:
 We got our newspaper one.

13:28.974 --> 13:31.974
 We have our pykrete mix,
 and we have plain water

13:32.044 --> 13:33.845
 that will turn to plain ice.

13:33.846 --> 13:36.114
 We're gonna pull them out
 when they're frozen

13:36.115 --> 13:39.115
 and launch them
 and see which one melts first.

13:39.151 --> 13:42.151
 NARRATOR: And they've come
 to Bamboo Reef to do just that.

13:44.123 --> 13:46.024
 Adam, what's our plan
 of action today?

13:46.025 --> 13:47.492
 Oh, Jamie,
 it's going to be totally great.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.494
 We're going to take all three
 ice boats out of the molds

13:49.495 --> 13:51.296
 and put them in the water
 and see which one melts first.

13:51.297 --> 13:53.064
 Then we're gonna use
 two little characters of us

13:53.065 --> 13:56.065
 to represent us
 just to increase the danger.

13:56.235 --> 13:57.335
 Do we really have to use

13:57.336 --> 13:59.370
 these stupid representations
 of ourselves?

13:59.371 --> 14:00.371
 I hate that.

14:00.372 --> 14:02.440
 Yeah, man, it's gonna be funny.

14:02.441 --> 14:05.043
 [ Sighs ] Okay.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.679
 NARRATOR:
 It's a head-to-head melt test

14:07.680 --> 14:10.680
 to find out which boat
 will be the last one floating.

14:11.217 --> 14:14.217
 And with a stunt doll standing
 by, first up is the ice.

14:15.421 --> 14:16.754
 ADAM: Why don't you try
 turning it over,

14:16.755 --> 14:18.389
 and I'll try
 and hold it on my hands.

14:18.390 --> 14:20.291
 [ Laughs ] Oh! Ah!

14:20.292 --> 14:21.960
 NARRATOR:
 Now, it may have cracked,

14:21.961 --> 14:24.961
 but all they're looking for
 is how long it takes to melt.

14:25.097 --> 14:26.431
 Abandon ship.

14:26.432 --> 14:28.066
 ADAM: [ Laughs ]

14:28.067 --> 14:30.235

 three-quarters of an inch thick

14:30.236 --> 14:33.236
 to a quarter-inch thick
 in about a minute.

14:33.939 --> 14:36.140
 NARRATOR:
 With the ice disappearing fast,

14:36.141 --> 14:39.141
 it's over to the pykrete
 and super-pykrete boats

14:39.311 --> 14:40.612
 to test the waters.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.480
 I'm gonna put a passenger
 in here.

14:42.481 --> 14:45.481
 Here we go.

14:45.584 --> 14:46.751
 [ High-pitched voice ]
 Oh, look at me!

14:46.752 --> 14:48.720
 I'm in a boat made out of ice.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.721
 Well, right off the bat,
 we can see it's better than ice.

14:52.057 --> 14:54.392
 ADAM: [ As Jamie ] Oh,
 look at me. My boat is perfect.

14:54.393 --> 14:56.794

 There's plenty to be smug about.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.539
 Five minutes in,
 and the super pykrete

15:08.540 --> 15:11.209
 is still going strong
 in the warm water,

15:11.210 --> 15:13.511
 but Adam's ship is sinking.

 -of the boat right there.
 -JAMIE: Yep.

15:17.216 --> 15:20.216
 NARRATOR: The pykrete held up
 five times longer than the ice.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.086
 There you go.

15:22.087 --> 15:25.087
 NARRATOR: But it's no match
 for the super pykrete.

15:25.190 --> 15:26.557
 ADAM:
 We're at an hour.

15:26.558 --> 15:29.558
 I'd say given that this is
 no longer a structure...

15:30.763 --> 15:33.264
 -JAMIE: I'd call it.
 -...we can call it.

15:33.265 --> 15:36.265
 NARRATOR: The super pykrete
 lasted 12 times longer

15:36.402 --> 15:37.869
 than the classic pykrete.

15:37.870 --> 15:40.305
 And let's face it,
 every second will count

15:40.306 --> 15:42.573
 in those icy Alaskan waters.

15:42.574 --> 15:44.442
 It looked like
 the newspaper pykrete

15:44.443 --> 15:46.411
 was just as strong
 as the regular pykrete.

15:46.412 --> 15:49.412
 But when we put it in the water,
 it becomes far superior

15:49.782 --> 15:52.750
 as a building material
 for our purposes.

15:52.751 --> 15:55.086
 You might see
 a pile of wet newspaper here.

 a snowplow collision

16:06.231 --> 16:09.133
 So what are they doing
 in Wisconsin?

16:09.134 --> 16:12.134
 Kari knows.
 So, uh, Alaska.

16:12.905 --> 16:14.839
 KARI: This is what
 we couldn't find in Alaska

16:14.840 --> 16:16.808

 No, no, not you two.

16:43.769 --> 16:46.769
 The snowplow versus the car.

16:47.639 --> 16:50.639
 But what is it
 that makes MGA so perfect?

16:50.876 --> 16:52.610
 We need the dead center
 of the car

16:52.611 --> 16:55.611
 to hit the pinnacle point
 of the blade of the snowplow.

16:55.914 --> 16:57.915
 And for that, we need
 something far more reliable,

16:57.916 --> 17:00.916
 which starts 900 feet that way.

17:02.054 --> 17:05.054
 With this,
 a continuous loop of steel cable

17:05.758 --> 17:08.526
 that propels the car
 along the guide rail

17:08.527 --> 17:11.527
 all powered by a 600-horsepower
 electric motor

17:12.931 --> 17:15.931
 that will ensure pinpoint
 accuracy and repeatability.

17:16.835 --> 17:18.636
 NARRATOR:
 So let's get that straight.

17:18.637 --> 17:20.538
 Instead of a towing system,

17:20.539 --> 17:23.539
 MGA use a motor to pull a cable
 which will let our car

17:24.675 --> 17:27.675
 plow into our stationary plow
 with incredible accuracy.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.949
 And speaking of cars...

17:31.950 --> 17:34.886
 So, the observant viewer
 is probably asking themselves,

17:34.887 --> 17:36.954
 "Why are there two cars?"

17:36.955 --> 17:39.424
 The engine is the most
 resistant part of the car.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.359
 So we need to test
 two different types of car,

17:41.360 --> 17:43.795
 a front-engine car
 and a rear-engine car.

17:43.796 --> 17:46.030
 Now, this is a front-engine car.

17:46.031 --> 17:49.031
 The only problem is,
 the other car we have...

17:51.003 --> 17:52.703
...is also a front-engine car.

17:52.704 --> 17:54.739
 So what we need to do
 is pull this engine out,

17:54.740 --> 17:57.740
 stick it on the back
 so we have our rear-engine car.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.712
 NARRATOR: While Tory
 puts the junk in the trunk,

18:01.713 --> 18:03.915
 the other car
 also needs some attention.

18:03.916 --> 18:06.284
 I got to Alaska up

18:12.491 --> 18:15.393
 I think this is gonna be
 a much more daunting task

18:15.394 --> 18:17.528
 than the snowplow actually
 thinks it's going to be.

18:17.529 --> 18:19.464
 It's got to get completely
 through this dashboard

18:19.465 --> 18:22.465
 all the way through the center
 of the car to the back?

18:22.468 --> 18:25.468

 seeing this actually happen.

 there's a lot of car to cleave.

 So will the snowplow
 be up to the task?

 for a big Alaskan-style crash.

 Well, the rear-engine vehicle
 is ready to go.

 and split this myth in two.

18:53.699 --> 18:55.900
 What they're doing right now is
 chaining the car to the skate.

18:55.901 --> 18:58.102
 The skate is a device
 that hooks onto the track

18:58.103 --> 19:00.905
 and ensures that the car goes
 straight the whole distance.

19:00.906 --> 19:03.808

 a high-tech quick release.

19:03.809 --> 19:05.543
 There's no blue rope here.

 tweaks, we're good to go.

 or human analogs of any sort.

19:36.108 --> 19:39.108
 But the myth says that both
 the passenger and the driver

19:39.344 --> 19:41.712
 made it out of the crash
 completely unharmed.

19:41.713 --> 19:44.713
 Now, if either one of these
 gets the slightest nick --

19:44.917 --> 19:47.917
 Pbht! --
 they'll totally deflate.

19:48.720 --> 19:51.720
 NARRATOR: And with the dummies
 sitting pretty,

19:52.424 --> 19:55.193
 here's how the test
 is going to go down.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.361
 This cable
 will pull that front-engine car

19:57.362 --> 19:59.297
 up to 55 miles an hour,

19:59.298 --> 20:01.766
 and 10 feet before the plow,
 it will release the car,

20:01.767 --> 20:03.901
 and it'll go smashing
 into the blade.

20:03.902 --> 20:05.536
 And if that all works out,

20:05.537 --> 20:07.538
 what we're looking for
 are two things.

20:07.539 --> 20:09.540
 Number one, does the car split

20:09.541 --> 20:12.541
 on the snowplow blade cleanly
 all the way down?

20:12.911 --> 20:14.111
 And number two,

20:14.112 --> 20:17.048
 are our inflatable people
 still inflated?

20:17.049 --> 20:20.049
 NARRATOR: Well, there's only
 one way to find out.

20:21.253 --> 20:23.487
 Because it's go time.

20:23.488 --> 20:26.488
 All right, this is front-engine
 car at 55 miles an hour

20:27.993 --> 20:30.561
 versus the mother
 of all snowplows.

20:30.562 --> 20:33.197
 In 3.. .2... 1.

20:33.198 --> 20:34.031
 Go!

20:34.032 --> 20:35.933
 NARRATOR:
 It's the moment of truth

20:35.934 --> 20:38.934
 as the car hurtles down
 the track at 55 miles per hour.

20:40.472 --> 20:41.973
 TORY:
 Looking good.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.074
 GRANT:
 It's looking great!

20:43.075 --> 20:44.308
 NARRATOR:
 But will the combination

20:44.309 --> 20:47.309
 of speed and snowplow
 be enough to split the car?

20:48.447 --> 20:51.447
 [ Cheering ]

20:51.750 --> 20:52.683
 Wow!

20:52.684 --> 20:54.452
 KARI:
 That is not bifurcated.

20:54.453 --> 20:57.453
 Nope, It didn't split in half,
 but that was awesome.

20:57.456 --> 20:58.756
 That's great!

20:58.757 --> 21:00.891
 NARRATOR: Yep, that test
 couldn't have gone better,

21:00.892 --> 21:03.892
 but that's hardly the result
 the team was looking for.

21:04.296 --> 21:06.597
 -That's not split in two.
 -No.

21:06.598 --> 21:07.732
 That's not even cut.

21:07.733 --> 21:09.667
 It's just like a dent
 in the front end.

21:09.668 --> 21:12.668
 GRANT: Yeah, it hit
 the engine block and stopped.

21:14.940 --> 21:17.875
 So as cool as this crash was,
 we're watching it real time.

21:17.876 --> 21:19.644
 So it only lasts a split second.

21:19.645 --> 21:22.645
 But luckily for the viewers,
 we have high-speed cameras.

21:22.914 --> 21:25.914
 And not just one, but four
 for their viewing pleasure.

21:28.387 --> 21:30.454
 NARRATOR:
 Viewing pleasure is right.

21:30.455 --> 21:33.455
 Every angle of that spectacular
 crash tells the same story.

21:34.826 --> 21:37.826
 Although the car hit the plow
 head on, there's no bifurcation.

21:40.098 --> 21:43.098
 But the Mythbusters aren't ready
 to call this one just yet.

21:43.735 --> 21:46.735
 After all,
 it wasn't a complete failure.

21:47.005 --> 21:49.540
 The bumper
 totally severed in half.

21:49.541 --> 21:52.541
 But that is only the first
 four inches of the car.

21:52.744 --> 21:55.744
 The other 98 % of the car,
 still pretty much intact.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.651
 NARRATOR:
 98 % still intact.

22:00.652 --> 22:03.254
 But the passengers, not so much.

22:03.255 --> 22:04.588
 I'm a trained CPR.

22:04.589 --> 22:05.723
 Don't worry.

22:05.724 --> 22:08.159
 I'm pretty sure these people

22:08.160 --> 22:10.961
 are not gonna be walking away
 from this accident.

22:10.962 --> 22:12.563
 We lost her.

22:12.564 --> 22:14.131
 NARRATOR:
 Sorry, Tory.

22:14.132 --> 22:17.132
 But to find out if the plow can
 split more than just a bumper,

22:17.636 --> 22:20.438
 it's over to plan B
 to bring up the rear.

22:20.439 --> 22:22.606
 Now we want to give it
 a better chance of working.

22:22.607 --> 22:25.607
 So we've got
 a Mythbuster-y rear-engine car

22:26.011 --> 22:28.045
 that we can try to split
 on the snowplow.

22:28.046 --> 22:30.848
 Maybe this will give us
 some sort of bifurcation.

22:30.849 --> 22:33.849
 NARRATOR: Yep, 'cause a snowplow
 smash just isn't enough.

22:34.753 --> 22:37.753
 To confirm this myth, we need to
 see a car split in two.

22:41.593 --> 22:44.593
 You can make some pretty useful
 stuff out of ice and wood,

22:46.531 --> 22:49.531
 but could you really make a boat
 out of both combined?

22:51.703 --> 22:54.305
 Well, to find out,
 Adam and Jamie have put pykrete

22:54.306 --> 22:56.507
 through its mythical paces.

22:56.508 --> 22:57.975
 [ High-pitched voice ]
 Oh, look at me!

22:57.976 --> 22:59.977
 I'm in a boat made out of ice.

22:59.978 --> 23:02.646
 NARRATOR:
 And so far, it's looking good.

23:02.647 --> 23:05.516
 So, it looks like pykrete
 is living up to its hype, huh?

23:05.517 --> 23:07.385
 Absolutely, it is.

23:07.386 --> 23:09.453
 This stuff is really impressive.

23:09.454 --> 23:12.454
 Impressive until you improved on
 it with the idea of newspaper.

23:13.925 --> 23:16.127
 Yeah, well, what's next, though?

23:16.128 --> 23:18.696
 Obviously,
 we have to finish this episode

23:18.697 --> 23:21.432
 putting around
 the Alaskan fjords

23:21.433 --> 23:23.901
 in a boat
 made out of newspaper and ice.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.836
 It's not like
 we're going to be able to build

23:25.837 --> 23:27.538
 a full-sized aircraft carrier.

23:27.539 --> 23:29.106
 -We don't have the time.
 -No.

23:29.107 --> 23:32.107
 What if we made a boat
 that looked like

23:32.444 --> 23:35.444
 and performs like a real,
 honest-to-goodness speedboat

23:35.981 --> 23:37.381
 with a big motor on it?

23:37.382 --> 23:39.717
 That is ambitious.

23:39.718 --> 23:41.419
 It will be fun, though.

23:41.420 --> 23:44.388
 I love it.
 Let's go.

23:44.389 --> 23:46.490
 NARRATOR:
 It's destination Alaska

23:46.491 --> 23:49.393
 to attempt to build and set sail

23:49.394 --> 23:52.394
 in the world's
 first frozen speedboat.

23:52.998 --> 23:55.998
 This is Ketchikan, Alaska,
 population just about 8,000.

23:57.469 --> 23:58.903
 Often the first stop
 for cruise ships

23:58.904 --> 24:00.471
 heading up the west coast
 of North America,

24:00.472 --> 24:03.472
 its Alaskan locale
 and proximity to water

24:03.608 --> 24:05.576
 make it the ideal place

24:05.577 --> 24:08.577
 for the maiden voyage
 of the "Mythbusters" ice boat.

24:09.948 --> 24:12.149
 And this is the
 Ketchikan High School wood shop.

24:12.150 --> 24:13.851
 It's a shop actually
 pretty similar to this

24:13.852 --> 24:16.587
 where I first cut my teeth
 in the making of things.

24:16.588 --> 24:18.722
 This is where
 2,000 pounds of newspaper,

24:18.723 --> 24:21.325
 aided by low temperatures,
 will hopefully become a boat.

24:21.326 --> 24:23.327
 Now, if you'll excuse me,
 I've got some work to do.

24:23.328 --> 24:24.428
 NARRATOR: Indeed.

24:24.429 --> 24:25.996
 Because in just a few days,

24:25.997 --> 24:28.997
 the boys will be putting
 their lives on the line...

24:29.034 --> 24:32.034
 ADAM:
 Dude, there's paper everywhere!

24:32.938 --> 24:35.005
 NARRATOR:
...in a boat made out of these?

24:35.006 --> 24:38.006
 What weighs over a ton
 and might end up being a boat?

24:38.510 --> 24:40.411
 That's right.
 Newspaper.

24:40.412 --> 24:43.412
 And we've got about
 15,000 local Alaskan newspapers

24:43.448 --> 24:46.317
 that we've got to unfold
 and soak

24:46.318 --> 24:48.118
 in order to build our boat.

24:48.119 --> 24:50.354
 It's too big a job
 for Jamie and me.

24:50.355 --> 24:53.355
 Okay. Welcome to Building a Boat
 Out of Paper 101.

24:54.860 --> 24:56.894
 ADAM: But luckily,
 Ketchikan High School

24:56.895 --> 24:58.929
 has some willing
 "Mythbusters" fans

24:58.930 --> 25:00.297
 who also happen to be students

25:00.298 --> 25:02.766
 who also happen to have
 some free time.

25:02.767 --> 25:04.535
 JAMIE:
 So, for this to work properly,

25:04.536 --> 25:07.438
 we need to make sure that water
 gets in between all of the pages

25:07.439 --> 25:10.439
 and all of the fibers
 and makes it all one piece.

25:11.710 --> 25:14.278
 Air bubbles and things like that
 aren't good.

25:14.279 --> 25:15.913
 It could cause it to delaminate.

25:15.914 --> 25:18.148
 And we've only got
 one shot at it.

25:18.149 --> 25:21.149
 NARRATOR:
 With 150,000 pages soaking,

25:21.486 --> 25:23.354
 the next step is the mold.

25:23.355 --> 25:26.355
 And Jamie has got
 just the design in mind.

25:26.625 --> 25:27.892
 JAMIE: I used to work
 as a boat captain.

25:27.893 --> 25:29.994
 So I've been around
 a lot of boats.

25:29.995 --> 25:31.262
 There was one type of boat

25:31.263 --> 25:33.063
 that caught my attention
 some years ago, though.

25:33.064 --> 25:34.965
 It was called
 the Carolina Skiff.

25:34.966 --> 25:37.868
 And that's because
 it has a flat bottom.

25:37.869 --> 25:39.570
 Now, the flat bottom allows it

25:39.571 --> 25:41.171
 to get up on a plane
 really quickly,

25:41.172 --> 25:43.841
 which is good for our purposes.

25:43.842 --> 25:46.842
 But also, it makes
 our mold-making really simple,

25:47.012 --> 25:50.012
 'cause the mold
 basically just has to be a box

25:50.515 --> 25:52.283
 with flat sides
 and bottoms and so on.

25:52.284 --> 25:55.019
 So we're gonna have a boat
 in no time at all.

25:55.020 --> 25:57.688
 Jamie and I ran through
 at least 20 different ways

25:57.689 --> 26:00.689
 to build this boat from the
 inside out, from the outside in.

26:00.792 --> 26:03.792
 Pouring it, spraying it,
 laying it, freezing it

26:04.129 --> 26:07.129
 until we came upon
 what we think is the solution

26:07.365 --> 26:09.400
 with the highest chance
 of success.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.969
 NARRATOR: It's going to be
 a painstaking process

26:11.970 --> 26:13.904
 that starts in the center...

26:13.905 --> 26:15.973
 ADAM:
 It's the first one.

26:15.974 --> 26:17.308
 NARRATOR:
...and works out

26:17.309 --> 26:19.743
 to protect the integrity
 of the boat.

26:19.744 --> 26:22.079
 ADAM: We're going to be
 layering the newspapers

26:22.080 --> 26:24.648
 layer over layer
 like the shingles of a roof

26:24.649 --> 26:27.051
 so that all the open sides
 of the newspaper

26:27.052 --> 26:29.253
 point away
 from the direction of travel.

26:29.254 --> 26:31.488
 Thus as it starts to melt,

26:31.489 --> 26:32.890
 the water
 is still not gonna be able

26:32.891 --> 26:35.826
 to peel off big chunks
 of newspaper as it's going,

26:35.827 --> 26:38.762
 and, hopefully,
 that will make it last longer.

26:38.763 --> 26:40.264
 NARRATOR:
 Well, that's the plan.

26:40.265 --> 26:41.765
 But it's going to take time...

26:41.766 --> 26:44.435
 Your back
 is getting to you already, huh?

26:44.436 --> 26:46.971
 NARRATOR:... as every layer
 is built from the center out,

26:46.972 --> 26:49.506
 front to back, one at a time.

26:49.507 --> 26:52.507
 Paper-boat-making is dirty work.

26:52.544 --> 26:53.844
 NARRATOR:
 Dirty work,

26:53.845 --> 26:56.845
 but the build is going
 just as they planned.

26:57.248 --> 26:59.984
 I feel like I'm working
 in a swamp. [ Chuckles ]

26:59.985 --> 27:01.652
 NARRATOR:
 And right on cue,

27:01.653 --> 27:04.653
 the all-important
 freezer truck arrives.

27:04.723 --> 27:06.890
 Ah, that's perfect.

27:06.891 --> 27:09.259
 It's nice and cold already.
 [ Chuckles ]

27:09.260 --> 27:11.462
 ADAM: That's it.
 Let's lay in some plastic.

27:11.463 --> 27:12.463
 Okay.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.231
 NARRATOR: With the plastic
 covering in place,

27:14.232 --> 27:15.532
 the boat is watertight.

27:15.533 --> 27:18.533
 So the boys construct
 the internal mold.

27:20.205 --> 27:21.772
 Lovely.

27:21.773 --> 27:24.475
 The outer mold is in place.
 The inner mold is in place.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.276
 And the newspaper and the water
 are in place.

27:26.277 --> 27:28.879
 It's time to get this thing
 into the freezer truck

27:28.880 --> 27:30.280
 and let physics take over.

27:30.281 --> 27:31.915
 NARRATOR:
 Which, when you're dealing

27:31.916 --> 27:34.485
 with something 20 feet long,
 8 feet wide,

27:34.486 --> 27:37.486
 and weighing 3,000 pounds,
 is easier said than done.

27:39.424 --> 27:41.091
 -Yeah.
 -We need all hands on deck.

27:41.092 --> 27:42.660
 I got the little forklift
 out here to pull it.

27:42.661 --> 27:43.661
 Oh, okay.

27:43.662 --> 27:44.695
 NARRATOR:
 And despite weather

27:44.696 --> 27:47.631
 that would freeze the balls
 off a pool table,

27:47.632 --> 27:49.633
 they get the boat
 onto the ice truck,

27:49.634 --> 27:51.201
 and the freezing can begin.

27:51.202 --> 27:54.202
 ADAM:
 Extra, extra, read all about it.

27:57.142 --> 27:59.109
 NARRATOR: Deep in the heart
 of Wisconsin...

27:59.110 --> 28:00.110
 Ah!

28:00.111 --> 28:03.111
 NARRATOR:... Grant, Tory,
 and Kari have been making music.

28:04.683 --> 28:07.683
 Welcome to the "Mythbusters"
 Alaska special in Wisconsin.

28:08.386 --> 28:10.954
 We're testing the myth
 that a car skids off the road,

28:10.955 --> 28:13.955
 goes head-on into a snowplow,
 bifurcates perfectly,

28:14.125 --> 28:17.125
 and the driver and the passenger
 walk away completely unharmed.

28:19.597 --> 28:20.898
 But in test one,

28:20.899 --> 28:23.734
 which was a front-engine car
 at 55 miles an hour,

28:23.735 --> 28:26.735
 the only thing to bifurcate
 was the front bumper.

28:26.805 --> 28:28.238
 And the passenger and driver,

28:28.239 --> 28:31.008
 they were pretty far
 from being unscathed.

28:31.009 --> 28:32.943
 But we can't bust this myth yet.

28:32.944 --> 28:35.212
 Our first vehicle
 was a front-engine car.

28:35.213 --> 28:38.213
 For test two, we have
 our modified rear-engine car,

28:38.516 --> 28:40.417
 which means there's
 hardly anything in the way

28:40.418 --> 28:41.685
 for that plow to cut through.

28:41.686 --> 28:43.921
 This vehicle is gonna give us
 the best chance

28:43.922 --> 28:46.922
 of confirming this myth.

28:47.759 --> 28:50.759
 And to give this myth
 even more of a fighting chance,

28:50.929 --> 28:53.929
 we've made
 a few additional changes.

28:54.566 --> 28:56.233
 NARRATOR:
 And the first of those changes

28:56.234 --> 28:58.769
 is to the pointy end
 of the plow.

28:58.770 --> 29:00.671
 GRANT: If you review
 the high-speed footage

29:00.672 --> 29:03.207
 from test one,
 you'll see that the snowplow

29:03.208 --> 29:05.476
 did, indeed,
 sustain a little bit of damage.

29:05.477 --> 29:08.477
 And, in fact, it left a little
 cove in the snowplow blade.

 Well, our friends at
 MGA Research have repaired it,

 made it better than new.

 to talk to about speed.

29:49.888 --> 29:51.355

 Well, I would love to do
 the 92 miles an hour

 lot further through the vehicle.

38:55.333 --> 38:58.333
 [ Scottish accent ]
 We've got to keep her afloat!

38:59.370 --> 39:01.037
 NARRATOR:
...he can't stem the tide.

39:01.038 --> 39:02.439
 JAMIE:
 The water is coming in quicker

39:02.440 --> 39:04.341
 than that pump can push it out.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.576
 I think we should head back
 into shore.

39:06.577 --> 39:08.812
 ADAM:
 Okay. Can I drive?

39:08.813 --> 39:10.046
 JAMIE:
 Yeah, go for it.

39:10.047 --> 39:13.047
 It's my last chance to drive
 a boat made out of freakin' ice!

39:14.585 --> 39:17.387
 NARRATOR: After 30 minutes
 on the high seas,

39:17.388 --> 39:19.155
 the guys head back to shore,

39:19.156 --> 39:22.156
 and just in time, judging
 by the trail of newspaper.

39:23.194 --> 39:26.194
 But our able-bodied Mythbusters
 aren't disappointed.

39:27.998 --> 39:29.399
 JAMIE:
 We did everything we could

39:29.400 --> 39:31.134
 as far as testing this material

39:31.135 --> 39:34.135
 before we got committed
 to making this whole big boat.

39:34.839 --> 39:37.574
 And it looked like
 it was gonna work out fine.

39:37.575 --> 39:39.476
 And who knew?
 It actually did.

39:39.477 --> 39:41.044
 It worked like a treat.

39:41.045 --> 39:43.113
 ADAM: What is a boat?
 A boat floats.

39:43.114 --> 39:46.114
 By that rudimentary definition,
 we've succeeded.

39:46.183 --> 39:48.118
 But more than that,
 a boat is made

39:48.119 --> 39:49.586
 to move efficiently
 over the water --

39:49.587 --> 39:52.255
 i.e., get up on the plane.

39:52.256 --> 39:55.225
 We put a 500-pound engine
 on this boat,

39:55.226 --> 39:57.060
 and we got up on a plane.

39:57.061 --> 40:00.061
 NARRATOR: Yep, Yesterday's News
 was papier-mÃƒÂ¢chÃƒÂ© in motion.

40:00.531 --> 40:01.898
 ADAM: I don't want to
 get all misty on you,

40:01.899 --> 40:03.666
 but it's a pleasure
 building strange crap with you.

40:03.667 --> 40:06.202
 [ Both laugh ]

40:06.203 --> 40:09.203
 JAMIE: That's one of the most
 gratifying parts of this job is,

40:09.440 --> 40:11.808
 trying something out,
 nobody's ever done it before.

40:11.809 --> 40:14.809
 And when it actually works,
 it's wonderful.

40:15.746 --> 40:18.581
 We came to Alaska to make a boat
 out of ice and newspaper.

40:18.582 --> 40:20.517
 And as far as I'm concerned
 [clicks tongue]

40:20.518 --> 40:22.051
 we knocked it out of the park.

40:22.052 --> 40:25.052
 NARRATOR: They came,
 they saw, they conquered.

40:26.357 --> 40:29.357
 JAMIE: It's funny to think
 that in a few hours,

40:29.360 --> 40:31.728
 those are just going to be
 a pile of mush.

40:31.729 --> 40:33.696
 ADAM: I know.
 I love that.

40:33.697 --> 40:36.533
 NARRATOR: And the Mythbusters
 abandoned their ship

40:36.534 --> 40:39.035
 to melt to slush.

40:39.036 --> 40:40.270
 How are we gonna call this one?

40:40.271 --> 40:41.971
 Seems to me
 pretty straightforward.

40:41.972 --> 40:43.940
 Pykrete lived up to all three

40:43.941 --> 40:45.875
 of its mythical properties
 beautifully.

40:45.876 --> 40:48.876
 And we built a viable boat
 out of ice and newspaper.

40:49.180 --> 40:51.147
 Not only did our boat
 get up on a plane,

40:51.148 --> 40:53.483
 not only did it
 go over 25 miles per hour,

40:53.484 --> 40:55.018
 but it looked so damn good,

40:55.019 --> 40:57.587
 I swear people
 are gonna think we faked it

40:57.588 --> 40:59.222
 even though we didn't.

40:59.223 --> 41:01.224
 I say that makes it plausible.

41:01.225 --> 41:03.326
 Yeah, but let's not forget
 that this myth

41:03.327 --> 41:06.327
 is about the original pykrete
 and about an aircraft carrier.

41:06.964 --> 41:09.632
 And given that our super pykrete

41:09.633 --> 41:12.535
 darn near melted through
 in 20 minutes,

41:12.536 --> 41:14.404
 if you're talking about
 an aircraft carrier

41:14.405 --> 41:15.905
 that can go anywhere
 in the world,

41:15.906 --> 41:17.941
 including tropical waters,

41:17.942 --> 41:20.942
 it's gonna be sloughing off
 huge chunks of this stuff

41:20.945 --> 41:22.445
 as it goes along.

41:22.446 --> 41:24.981
 That means
 it's just not at all practical.

41:24.982 --> 41:27.982
 How about
 plausible but ludicrous?

41:28.305 --> 41:34.230
