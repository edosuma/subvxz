Everything he's stolen,
they're all pieces of something.

15:21.445 --> 15:25.404
They're putting together a weapon
that generates black holes.

15:25.582 --> 15:28.278
Come on. To build that,
you'd need a particle accelerator.

15:28.452 --> 15:33.219
- Like the Large Boson Collider in Geneva?
- The circus' next stop.

15:33.390 --> 15:36.154
Now that Parasite can fly,
he's got a big head start on us.

15:36.326 --> 15:38.351
Sorry.

15:38.529 --> 15:42.522
Not your fault.
But this thing could wipe out entire cities.

15:42.699 --> 15:45.167
- We need to hurry.
- You and I need to hurry.

15:45.335 --> 15:47.428
Without powers,
the others would hold us back.

15:47.604 --> 15:49.765
Hey, you're not the only one
with a back-up bow.

15:49.940 --> 15:51.498
[BANG]

15:51.675 --> 15:53.108
And my powers are back.

15:53.277 --> 15:54.301
ROBIN: How?
MISS MARTIAN: I'm still...

15:54.478 --> 15:57.311
I guess Kryptonians recover faster
than humans or Martians.

15:58.115 --> 16:00.811
Don't even think
about leaving me behind.

16:06.223 --> 16:08.157
[GROANING]

16:08.525 --> 16:10.789
Trail of destruction. This way.

16:19.937 --> 16:21.199
[SIGHS]

16:24.241 --> 16:25.538
[BEEPING]

16:30.147 --> 16:33.048
This would be a whole lot easier
with my flash-drive.

16:34.117 --> 16:35.709
[BEEPING]

16:35.886 --> 16:39.322
There. Now let's fire this baby up...

16:39.923 --> 16:43.256
...and see what's left of Geneva
when we're done.

16:43.660 --> 16:45.651
[POWERING UP]

16:57.007 --> 16:58.338
Need to take him down.

16:58.509 --> 17:00.943
Or at least lure him away
so we can safely disengage the...

17:01.111 --> 17:02.169
[SCREAMS]

17:02.346 --> 17:04.337
- No, wait.
SUPERBOY: Aah!

17:04.948 --> 17:08.440
Seconds? No, I couldn't.

17:08.852 --> 17:09.876
[SCREAMS]

17:17.426 --> 17:19.452
- What's wrong with...?
- Wait.

17:22.366 --> 17:25.233
[GRUNTING]

17:30.274 --> 17:32.572
Oh. What a rush.

17:32.743 --> 17:36.804
How do you do it, kid?
Even Superman never recharged this fast.

17:36.980 --> 17:39.540
[GROANING]

17:42.185 --> 17:44.176
[POWERING UP]

17:50.260 --> 17:52.751
All right, Dangers, come on out.

17:52.930 --> 17:57.799
Only a couple minutes before this baby's
done warming up and eats Geneva.

17:57.968 --> 18:00.459
- What do you think?
- Big risk to take on a theory.

18:00.637 --> 18:02.400
Do it. Go.

18:06.410 --> 18:08.071
What do you have against Geneva?

18:08.245 --> 18:12.011
Never liked the food.
But the menu keeps improving.

18:12.182 --> 18:14.082
I'm just the appetizer, remember?

18:14.484 --> 18:16.315
[BOTH GRUNTING]

18:18.956 --> 18:20.753
Here's the main course.

18:27.764 --> 18:33.031
Foam? You think foam can hold me?

18:33.303 --> 18:34.964
[GRUNTING]

18:35.138 --> 18:37.698
Or stop me from crushing you
with a thought?

18:37.874 --> 18:41.605
Combined Martian
and Kryptonian powers here.

18:41.778 --> 18:45.646
But do any of those powers free you
before I sabotage your death-thingy?

18:45.816 --> 18:48.046
This one does.

19:01.765 --> 19:06.099
So clever.
Trick me into igniting flammable gas.

19:06.269 --> 19:11.434
But you forgot
doofus' double-dose of invulnerability.

19:11.608 --> 19:14.941
[SPEAKING SLOWLY]
Fire can't touch me.

19:15.112 --> 19:20.345
Unless you make a meal of my powers
and get my weaknesses as a side dish.

19:21.084 --> 19:23.018
No.

19:23.186 --> 19:24.312
No.

19:24.488 --> 19:26.547
[GROANING]

19:29.493 --> 19:32.724
Aw. Poor baby. Something you ate?

[POWERING DOWN]

19:42.039 --> 19:43.063
Whew.

19:43.240 --> 19:44.935
We'll take it from here.

19:50.647 --> 19:52.171
[COLLAR BEEPS]

19:54.251 --> 19:55.718
Thanks for the tip, by the way.

19:55.886 --> 19:58.514
Definitely helps to prep
the inhibitor collar in advance.

19:58.689 --> 20:00.452
Glad to be of service.

20:08.198 --> 20:13.261
Wow. He deigns to touch the hand
of a suspected traitor.

20:13.437 --> 20:15.905
Mind open.

20:16.073 --> 20:19.042
I guess I never really saw you three
in the thick of it before.

20:19.209 --> 20:22.144
Superboy's a hothead,
but I know I'm not one to talk.

20:22.312 --> 20:26.772
You could each have betrayed us here.
You didn't. I'm sorry I doubted any of you.

20:27.350 --> 20:29.682
There is no mole.

20:33.023 --> 20:39.587
So the show will go on, and I have
the feeling I have you Dangers to thank.

20:39.763 --> 20:44.530
- Don't know what you mean.
- No, of course not.

20:44.701 --> 20:48.603
- But I'm guessing you'll be leaving now.
- Time to move on.

20:49.206 --> 20:54.007
- Well, Dick, I'll miss you.
- It's Dan. Dan Danger.

20:54.177 --> 20:56.611
Son, you've grown...

20:56.780 --> 21:02.013
...but some things never change,
like the sight of a Grayson on the trapeze.

21:02.619 --> 21:05.281
You can't fake that. Can't hide it.

21:05.455 --> 21:08.982
So do an old ringmaster one last favor.

21:14.598 --> 21:16.828
Ladies and gentlemen...

21:17.000 --> 21:20.492
...the farewell performance
of the Daring Dangers.
