So, one night when I went

03:12.492 --> 03:14.093
I was in the park
with my nephews,

03:14.160 --> 03:16.429
and we were walking with the dog
that I had just gotten.

03:16.496 --> 03:18.431
And I looked down,

03:18.498 --> 03:21.367
and the leash actually
had split into two.

03:21.434 --> 03:24.804
So, my nephew was holding one,
and then I was holding one.

03:24.871 --> 03:27.907
And it's just kind of
an "ah-ha" moment in the dream.

03:27.974 --> 03:30.543
So, I woke up, started
drawing some sketches.

03:30.610 --> 03:32.779
Um, then I started pretty
much reaching out

03:32.845 --> 03:36.549
to some manufacturers,
and it all took off from there.

the conversation with people

a little more, like,

03:47.427 --> 03:48.928
"Let's go here,
let's go there."

Wilson:
Well, why was the name hard?

03:58.304 --> 04:01.240
The name was hard
because, unfortunately,

04:01.307 --> 04:03.309

been over-sexualized,

04:03.376 --> 04:05.044

about it when I was--

04:06.679 --> 04:08.781

reaching out to find people

04:08.848 --> 04:10.650

and different things like that.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.919

-Wilson: Oh, did they
think this was a sex toy?
-(laughs) Yeah.

04:15.254 --> 04:18.024

<i>So, take a look in</i>

04:41.414 --> 04:43.216

04:52.091 --> 04:53.660

04:53.726 --> 04:56.429

04:56.496 --> 04:58.464
<i>something like that already.</i>

04:58.531 --> 05:01.467
<i>So if you can't</i>
<i>think of a product,</i>

05:01.534 --> 05:04.937

you're not being force-fed
a bunch of irrelevant junk

05:31.898 --> 05:34.333

You know, you think back

05:34.400 --> 05:36.269
to when you used to get
these giant catalogs

05:36.335 --> 05:38.304
of just crap that
you didn't want.

05:38.371 --> 05:41.007

all these ads,

05:41.074 --> 05:43.609
like on TV that had
nothing to do with you.

05:43.676 --> 05:46.746
So, the idea is,
of course, the right one

05:46.813 --> 05:49.449
where they want
to deliver things that
are relevant to you.

05:49.515 --> 05:51.784
Wilson:
Okay, so this is kind of
the interface you use

05:51.851 --> 05:54.287
-to create an ad on Facebook?
-Advertiser 1: Yeah.

05:54.353 --> 05:57.023

Correct. We can create
some audiences here.

Relationship status...

Ov-over six million
people are widowed?

06:00.893 --> 06:02.361

-Advertiser 2: Mm.

06:02.428 --> 06:04.430
Wilson:
Wow. Is that pork?

06:04.497 --> 06:06.599
Advertiser 2:
Yeah, presumably.

06:06.666 --> 06:09.102
What we developed
and we received the patent on

06:09.168 --> 06:11.971
is the ability to see
a person going on a site,

06:12.038 --> 06:14.040
what they were actually
looking at, their intent.

06:14.107 --> 06:17.110
Wilson:
Do you think like with all these
data points, you might know

06:17.176 --> 06:19.579
like a user better than
they know themselves?

06:19.645 --> 06:21.914

<i>it was about a guy</i>
<i>in a wheelchair</i>

19:45.751 --> 19:48.020
<i>who uploads his consciousness</i>

19:48.086 --> 19:51.023
<i>into a tall, agile creature</i>

19:51.089 --> 19:52.724
<i>that lives in some kind of</i>

19:52.791 --> 19:54.660
<i>jungle paradise</i>

19:54.726 --> 19:57.329
<i>where they even speak</i>
<i>their own language</i>

19:57.396 --> 19:59.398
<i>and make love by</i>

19:59.464 --> 20:03.335
<i>attaching their</i>
<i>ponytails together.</i>

20:03.402 --> 20:06.772
<i>The people of Earth were</i>
<i>trying to extract resources</i>

20:06.838 --> 20:08.774
<i>from the "Avatar" planet,</i>

20:08.840 --> 20:11.944
<i>and after a bunch of</i>
<i>fighting and stuff,</i>

20:12.010 --> 20:15.714
<i>the main guy decides to</i>
<i>stay in his avatar body</i>

20:15.781 --> 20:18.784
<i>with all the other</i>
<i>avatars in this utopia</i>

20:18.850 --> 20:20.852
<i>and never go back to Earth.</i>

20:22.454 --> 20:25.891
<i>You remember feeling really</i>
<i>emotional after watching it,</i>

20:25.958 --> 20:28.026
<i>which is more than any fantasy</i>

20:28.093 --> 20:31.730
<i>had made you feel in a while.</i>

20:31.797 --> 20:35.634
<i>And maybe if you spent time</i>
<i>with other fans of the movie,</i>

20:35.701 --> 20:39.004
<i>you'd get a better idea</i>
<i>of why you felt that way.</i>

20:40.005 --> 20:42.274
<i>The guy from</i>
<i>the comic store told you</i>

20:42.341 --> 20:44.009
<i>that they, um,</i>
<i>were having an event</i>

20:44.076 --> 20:47.512
<i>up at a conference</i>
<i>room in Midtown.</i>

20:47.579 --> 20:51.516
<i>They decorated the place with</i>
<i>a bunch of stuff from the movie</i>

20:51.583 --> 20:54.620
<i>or maybe inspired by it.</i>

20:54.686 --> 20:56.755
You saw it twice
in theaters?

20:56.822 --> 20:58.857
I never go to see movies
more than once in a theater.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.593
-How many times did you see it?
-Five times. (laughs)

21:01.660 --> 21:04.196
Wilson:
<i>After a while, they started</i>
<i>to say a bunch of stuff</i>

21:04.262 --> 21:06.531
<i>that you didn't</i>
<i>really understand.</i>

21:06.598 --> 21:09.668
(speaking Na'vi)

21:12.738 --> 21:13.705
(laughs)

21:13.772 --> 21:15.874
Wilson:
<i>And you quickly realize that</i>

21:15.941 --> 21:19.444
<i>it was actually</i>
<i>the language from the movie,</i>

21:19.511 --> 21:21.580
<i>which they all spoke fluently.</i>

21:21.647 --> 21:24.016
The reason that the adjective
has to be next to the word

21:24.082 --> 21:27.119
that it describes is because
of that flexible word order.

21:27.185 --> 21:29.855
So, if it was on this side,
it would be...

21:29.921 --> 21:31.189
(Na'vi word)

21:31.256 --> 21:34.459
(movie chatter)

21:34.526 --> 21:37.696
-Fan 1: Okay, this scene
works so much better in 3D.
-Fan 2: Right?

21:37.763 --> 21:41.767
-(movie continues)
-(indistinct mumbling)

21:41.833 --> 21:45.704
Fan 3:
Here's the thing. This is
one of the only kiss scenes

21:45.771 --> 21:49.408
in any movie with any CGI
that's actually very, um...

21:49.474 --> 21:52.077
-Fan 4: Believable.
-Fan 3: Yeah,
it's very believable.

21:52.144 --> 21:54.513
Wilson:
<i>And after watching the film,</i>

21:54.579 --> 21:56.715
<i>they sat around talking about</i>

21:56.782 --> 22:00.252
<i>how the world of Avatar</i>
<i>has impacted their lives.</i>

22:00.318 --> 22:02.988
I saw it the first two times
in theaters, and I was like,

22:03.055 --> 22:05.223
this is one of the best
movies I've ever seen.

22:05.290 --> 22:07.259
I like, love this movie.

22:07.325 --> 22:09.761
Every time I've
watched it after,

22:11.029 --> 22:14.199
I had-- I would always
hit about a week or two

22:14.266 --> 22:17.402
-of a really deep depression.
-Fan 1: It feels like,

22:17.469 --> 22:19.838
wow, like, this is so beautiful,

22:19.905 --> 22:22.841
and it also, also just
feels impossible.

22:22.908 --> 22:24.976
Like, this can never be.

22:25.043 --> 22:27.479
That's where the hopelessness
component comes from.

22:27.546 --> 22:30.849
Fan 4:
For me, the post-Avatar
depression hit hard

22:30.916 --> 22:33.785
because I had this
serial track record

22:33.852 --> 22:37.289
of just trying to escape
my reality, and,

22:37.355 --> 22:38.790
uh, it--

22:38.857 --> 22:41.927
"Avatar" provided
that escapism in a way

22:41.993 --> 22:45.397
that I had never really
experienced before.

22:45.464 --> 22:48.233
If you could lay down tonight,

22:48.300 --> 22:52.204
and wake up tomorrow
as a Na'vi on Pandora...

22:52.270 --> 22:54.239
-Heck yes!
-...would you take that?

22:54.306 --> 22:55.841
Absolutely.

22:55.907 --> 22:57.943
Closely tied with
escapism is the idea

22:58.009 --> 23:00.212
that it is just an escape.
Like, at the end of the day,

23:00.278 --> 23:02.948
you have to come
back to reality.

23:03.014 --> 23:06.151
And so there, there
are those out there

23:06.218 --> 23:09.488
who feel like the film
enables ableism,

23:09.554 --> 23:11.590
in that the main character

23:11.656 --> 23:14.493
is able to escape his
disability, you know,

23:14.559 --> 23:16.394
and have this,
this perfect body.

23:16.461 --> 23:18.263
If you're disabled,
and you say

23:18.330 --> 23:20.432
you wouldn't take that
opportunity if given to it,

23:20.499 --> 23:22.534
-you're lying.
-(laughter)

23:22.601 --> 23:25.403
-Because as someone
who struggles...
-Yep.

23:25.470 --> 23:27.906
with hearing, and I have

23:27.973 --> 23:29.641
some brain damage and such

23:29.708 --> 23:31.810
caused by being
struck by a car,

23:31.877 --> 23:34.880
-I would 100% be
in that link unit.
-Mm-hmm.

23:34.946 --> 23:38.083
I just couldn't see my life
going anywhere,

23:38.150 --> 23:40.252
and I was honestly
experiencing

23:40.318 --> 23:43.221
a lot of suicidal ideation,

23:43.288 --> 23:46.224
and I just started talking

23:46.291 --> 23:49.261
to some of the people
on Learn Na'vi,

23:49.327 --> 23:52.197
and I said...

23:52.264 --> 23:54.432
"I can't see my life
going anywhere.

23:54.499 --> 23:58.003
"I want to be an artist.
I want to do all these things.

23:58.069 --> 24:00.305
"I have stories that I want
to share with the world,

24:00.372 --> 24:03.141
but I just can't see
it ever happening."

24:04.776 --> 24:06.878
And that's when...

24:06.945 --> 24:10.081
Alensi contacted me,
and he said,

24:10.148 --> 24:13.318
"Hey, man, you need
somebody to talk to."

24:13.385 --> 24:15.620
And I was like,
"Talking never helps."

24:15.687 --> 24:18.023
And I talked anyways.

24:18.089 --> 24:20.125
Alensi:
For about a month or two.
(laughs)

24:20.192 --> 24:22.194
For about
a month or two, yeah.

24:22.260 --> 24:25.764
And he said, "Say the word,
and I'll come get you."

24:27.299 --> 24:29.134
And...

24:29.201 --> 24:31.636
that was the most
selfless thing

24:31.703 --> 24:33.738
that I'd ever heard anybody say.

24:35.740 --> 24:37.275
And...

24:38.643 --> 24:41.012
you know, I said,
"Okay, come get me."

24:41.079 --> 24:42.380
(laughs)

24:42.447 --> 24:46.518
And since then, he has
brought me in as, you know,

24:46.585 --> 24:49.821
he's, he's been the father
that I've always wanted.

24:49.888 --> 24:52.023
-And, uh...
-Mm-hmm.

24:52.090 --> 24:54.125
(laughs)

24:56.027 --> 24:58.396
Ultimately,
it comes from a desire

24:58.463 --> 25:00.131
to want something better.

25:00.198 --> 25:03.668
-Fans: Mm-hmm.
-But, just because
we have that desire,

I think it drives us
to make the world

25:05.704 --> 25:08.073

a better place.
