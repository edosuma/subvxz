01:29.040 --> 01:30.119
Grandpa!

01:30.207 --> 01:34.205
You're not supposed to be up here,
looking at that.

01:34.712 --> 01:36.835
I just wanted to know.

01:38.090 --> 01:40.462
Well, you're old enough, I suppose.

01:41.343 --> 01:44.131
You should know the story.

01:45.765 --> 01:48.053
OK, here we go.

01:49.018 --> 01:52.102
It was 1832.

01:53.147 --> 01:56.397
On a night much like this.

02:03.324 --> 02:09.610
Charles Carroll was the last surviving
signer of the Declaration of Independence.

02:10.413 --> 02:14.115
He was also a member
of a secret society known as the Masons.

02:14.710 --> 02:17.664
And he knew he was dying.

02:18.422 --> 02:20.913
He woke up his stable boy
in the middle of the night

02:21.008 --> 02:25.670
and ordered him to take him to
the White House to see Andrew Jackson,

02:25.763 --> 02:28.930
because it was urgent
that he speak to the president.

02:29.928 --> 02:31.470
Did he talk to him?

02:31.846 --> 02:34.764
No. He never got the chance.

02:34.849 --> 02:37.221
The president wasn't there that night.

02:38.728 --> 02:41.848
But Charles Carroll had a secret.

02:41.940 --> 02:46.187
So he took into his confidence
the one person he could,

02:46.277 --> 02:49.231
my grandfather's grandfather,

02:49.989 --> 02:51.816
Thomas Gates.

02:51.908 --> 02:54.114
What was the secret?

02:56.955 --> 02:57.951
A treasure.

03:00.083 --> 03:03.203
A treasure beyond all imagining.

03:07.257 --> 03:10.423
A treasure that had been
fought over for centuries

03:10.510 --> 03:14.923
by tyrants, pharaohs,
emperors, warlords.

03:15.223 --> 03:18.722
And every time it changed hands
it grew larger.

03:21.688 --> 03:24.261
And then suddenly...

03:24.607 --> 03:26.683
it vanished.

03:28.528 --> 03:31.648
It didn't reappear
for more than a thousand years,

03:31.740 --> 03:33.566
when knights from the First Crusade

03:33.658 --> 03:37.110
discovered secret vaults
beneath the Temple of Solomon.

03:37.203 --> 03:39.694
You see, the knights who found the vaults

03:39.789 --> 03:44.167
believed that the treasure
was too great for any one man -

03:44.252 --> 03:46.245
not even a king.

03:46.337 --> 03:52.672
They brought the treasure back to Europe
and took the name "the Knights Templar".

03:55.138 --> 03:58.222
Over the next century
they smuggled it out of Europe

03:58.308 --> 04:01.225
and they formed a new brotherhood
called the Freemasons,

04:01.311 --> 04:04.098
in honour of
the builders of the great temple.

04:05.482 --> 04:06.940
War followed.

04:07.025 --> 04:10.969
By the time of the American Revolution
the treasure had been hidden again.

04:11.065 --> 04:13.223
By then the Masons included

04:13.317 --> 04:17.445
George Washington,
Benjamin Franklin, Paul Revere.

04:18.447 --> 04:20.274
They knew they had to make sure

04:20.366 --> 04:23.781
the treasure would never fall
into the hands of the British.

04:23.869 --> 04:27.997
So they devised a series of clues
and maps to its location.

04:28.082 --> 04:30.869
Over time the clues were lost or forgotten,

04:30.959 --> 04:33.118
until only one remained -

04:33.212 --> 04:39.215
and that was the secret that Charles Carroll
entrusted to young Thomas Gates.

04:45.307 --> 04:46.338
Charlotte.

04:47.184 --> 04:50.635
"The secret lies with Charlotte."

04:51.355 --> 04:53.146
Who's Charlotte?

04:53.232 --> 04:56.897
Oh, not even Mr Carroll knew that.

04:56.985 --> 04:58.777
Now look here, Ben.

04:58.862 --> 05:03.275
The Freemasons
among our Founding Fathers left us clues.

05:03.367 --> 05:04.861
Like these.

05:04.952 --> 05:08.237
The unfinished pyramid.
The all-seeing eye.

05:08.747 --> 05:12.994
Symbols of the Knights Templar,
guardians of the treasure.

05:13.752 --> 05:18.877
- They're speaking to us through these.
- You mean laughing at us.

05:18.966 --> 05:21.753
You know what that dollar represents?

05:21.844 --> 05:24.417
The entire Gates family fortune.

05:24.513 --> 05:28.890
Six generations of fools...
chasing after fool's gold.

05:28.976 --> 05:32.392
It's not about the money, Patrick.
It's never been about the money.

05:32.479 --> 05:34.638
Come on, son. Time to go.

05:35.274 --> 05:38.061
You can... say your goodbyes.

05:45.534 --> 05:47.159
Grandpa?

05:50.324 --> 05:52.032
Are we knights?

05:55.079 --> 05:57.487
Do you want to be?

05:57.582 --> 06:00.998
All right. Um... kneel.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.554
Benjamin Franklin Gates,

06:14.640 --> 06:20.264
you take upon yourself the duty
of the Templars, the Freemasons

06:20.355 --> 06:23.272
and the family Gates.

06:24.025 --> 06:26.064
Do you so swear?

06:26.152 --> 06:28.145
I so swear.

06:50.760 --> 06:53.085
I was thinking about
Henson and Peary,

06:53.179 --> 06:57.758
crossing this kind of terrain with nothing
more than dog sleds and on foot.

06:57.850 --> 07:00.520
- Can you imagine?
- It's extraordinary.

07:06.567 --> 07:08.525
We getting closer?

07:08.611 --> 07:12.609
Assuming Ben's theory's correct
and my tracking model's accurate,

07:12.699 --> 07:15.403
we should be getting very close.

07:15.493 --> 07:19.111
But don't go by me -
I broke a shoelace this morning.

07:22.375 --> 07:26.040
- It's... it's a bad omen.
- Shall we turn around and go home?

07:26.129 --> 07:29.295
Or we could pull over
and just throw him out here.

07:31.169 --> 07:32.367
OK.

07:32.462 --> 07:36.080
Riley, you're not missing that little
windowless cubicle we found you in?

07:36.174 --> 07:38.297
No, no. Absolutely not.

07:56.403 --> 07:59.238
Why are we stopping?
I thought we were looking for a ship.

07:59.322 --> 08:03.367
- I don't see any ship.
- She's out there.

08:13.628 --> 08:17.080
Look... this is a waste of time.

08:17.174 --> 08:20.175
How could a ship wind up way out here?

08:20.260 --> 08:23.427
Well, I'm no expert, but...

08:23.513 --> 08:26.598
it could be that the hydrothermic properties
of this region

08:26.683 --> 08:29.257
produce hurricane-force ice storms

08:29.353 --> 08:33.433
that cause the ocean to freeze
and then melt and then refreeze,

08:33.523 --> 08:38.150
resulting in a semisolid
migrating land mass

08:38.236 --> 08:41.937
that would land a ship right around here.

09:30.908 --> 09:32.735
Hello, beautiful.

09:40.960 --> 09:44.376
Have Viktor
check the fuel in the generators.

09:44.839 --> 09:49.714
Two years ago, if you hadn't shown up,
hadn't believed the treasure was real,

09:49.802 --> 09:52.127
I don't know
if I ever would have found Charlotte.

09:52.221 --> 09:54.973
You would have found it, I have no doubt.

09:55.057 --> 09:59.435
That's why I didn't think it was
as crazy an investment as everyone said.

09:59.812 --> 10:04.023
I'm just relieved that I'm not as crazy
as everyone says. Or said my dad was.

10:04.442 --> 10:07.526
Or my granddad. Or my great-granddad.

10:09.196 --> 10:10.988
OK!

10:11.073 --> 10:13.113
Let's go!

10:13.909 --> 10:17.907
- Let's go find some treasure.
- Yeah, bring us back something.

10:56.738 --> 10:58.944
Oh, God!

11:01.868 --> 11:03.695
You handled that well.

11:04.788 --> 11:07.195
This is it.

11:07.624 --> 11:09.533
It's the cargo hold.

11:21.888 --> 11:24.640
Do you think it's in the barrels?

11:43.493 --> 11:45.071
Gunpowder.

11:48.331 --> 11:49.909
OK...

11:54.337 --> 11:57.753
Why would the captain
be guarding this barrel?

12:22.866 --> 12:24.858
I found something!

12:31.452 --> 12:33.444
What is it?

12:50.929 --> 12:53.136
Do you guys know what this is?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.929
Is it a billion-dollar pipe?

12:57.728 --> 13:01.144
It's a meerschaum pipe.
Ah, that is beautiful.

13:01.231 --> 13:04.647
Look at the intricacy of the scrollwork
on the stem.

13:04.735 --> 13:08.898
- Is it a million-dollar pipe?
- No, it's a clue.

13:08.989 --> 13:11.741
Let me see that.

13:12.743 --> 13:14.949
No, don't break it!

13:15.037 --> 13:17.658
We are one step closer to the treasure,
gentlemen.

13:17.748 --> 13:20.321
Ben, I thought you said that
the treasure would be on the Charlotte.

13:20.417 --> 13:22.955
No, "The secret lies with Charlotte."

13:23.045 --> 13:25.121
I said it could be here.

13:41.980 --> 13:44.650
It's Templar symbols.

13:51.115 --> 13:53.154
"The legend writ."

13:53.242 --> 13:55.365
"The stain effected."

13:55.452 --> 13:58.489
"The key in Silence undetected."

13:59.081 --> 14:02.082
"Fifty-five in iron pen."

14:03.168 --> 14:05.541
"Mr Matlack can't offend."

14:09.174 --> 14:11.327
It's a riddle.

14:14.507 --> 14:16.215
I need to think.

14:19.762 --> 14:21.755
"The legend writ."

14:21.848 --> 14:23.805
"The stain effected."

14:24.726 --> 14:26.718
What legend?

14:27.729 --> 14:32.022
There's the legend of the Templar treasure,
and the stain effects the legend.

14:32.108 --> 14:34.184
How?

14:34.277 --> 14:36.684
"The key in Silence undetected."

14:37.697 --> 14:39.690
Wait.

14:40.575 --> 14:44.619
The legend and the key...
Now there's something.

14:44.704 --> 14:46.163
A map.

14:46.247 --> 14:49.034
Maps have legends, maps have keys.

14:49.125 --> 14:51.283
It's a map, an invisible map.
So now...

14:51.377 --> 14:55.042
Wait a minute. What do you mean,
"invisible" - "an invisible map"?

14:55.131 --> 14:59.425
"The stain effected"
could refer to a dye or a reagent

14:59.510 --> 15:02.048
used to bring about a certain result.

15:02.138 --> 15:04.973
Combined with
"The key in Silence undetected",

15:05.058 --> 15:10.099
the implication is that the effect is to make
what was undetectable detectable.

15:10.813 --> 15:15.025
Unless...
"The key in Silence" could be...

15:15.109 --> 15:17.600
Prison.

15:18.446 --> 15:20.154
Albuquerque.

15:20.239 --> 15:22.813
See, I can do it too.
Snorkel.

15:22.909 --> 15:25.660
That's where the map is.
Like he said, "Fifty-five in iron pen."

15:25.745 --> 15:27.204
"Iron pen" is a prison.

15:27.288 --> 15:32.709
Or it could be, since the primary writing
medium of the time was iron gall ink,

15:32.794 --> 15:35.711
the "pen" is... just a pen.

15:35.797 --> 15:40.209
But then why not say a pen?
Why... why say "iron pen"?

15:41.052 --> 15:43.091
Cos it's a prison.

15:43.179 --> 15:47.307
Wait a minute. "Iron pen" - the "iron"
does not describe the ink in the pen,

15:48.184 --> 15:51.013
it describes what was penned.

15:51.098 --> 15:54.348
It was "iron" -
it was firm, it was mineral...

15:54.434 --> 15:56.094
No, no, no, that's stupid.

15:56.186 --> 16:01.607
It was... It was firm,
it was adamant, it was resolved.

16:03.402 --> 16:05.394
It was resolved.

16:06.196 --> 16:08.153
"Mr Matlack can't offend."

16:08.240 --> 16:11.905
Timothy Matlack was the official scribe
of the Continental Congress.

16:11.994 --> 16:16.287
Calligrapher, not writer. And to make sure
he could not offend the map,

16:16.373 --> 16:20.157
it was put on the back of a resolution
that he transcribed,

16:20.252 --> 16:24.166
a resolution that 55 men signed.

16:26.925 --> 16:29.760
The Declaration of Independence.

16:36.435 --> 16:40.847
Come on, there's no invisible map on the
back of the Declaration of Independence.

16:40.939 --> 16:43.395
That's clever, really.
A document of that importance

16:43.483 --> 16:45.725
would ensure the map's survival.

16:45.819 --> 16:48.571
And you said there were several Masons
signed it, yeah?

16:48.655 --> 16:51.941
Yeah. Nine, for sure.

16:53.285 --> 16:56.820
We'll have to arrange a way to examine it.

16:56.913 --> 17:00.080
This is one of the most important
documents in history.

17:00.167 --> 17:04.544
They're not just gonna let us waltz in there
and run chemical tests on it.

17:04.628 --> 17:07.166
- Then what do you propose we do?
- I don't know!

17:11.011 --> 17:13.217
We could borrow it.

17:14.181 --> 17:16.173
Steal it?

17:17.601 --> 17:20.471
- I don't think so.
- Ben...

17:20.561 --> 17:24.012
the treasure of the Knights Templar
is the treasure of all treasures.

17:24.107 --> 17:26.811
Oh, I didn't know that.
Really?

17:27.653 --> 17:32.024
Look, Ben... I understand your bitterness.
I really do.

17:32.360 --> 17:34.436
You've spent your entire life
searching for this treasure,

17:34.528 --> 17:36.735
only to have
the respected historical community

17:36.822 --> 17:40.654
treat you and your family
with mockery and contempt.

17:40.743 --> 17:43.234
You should be able to rub this treasure
in their arrogant faces,

17:43.329 --> 17:45.998
and I want you to have
the chance to do that.

17:46.999 --> 17:48.577
How?

17:48.959 --> 17:51.747
We all have our areas of expertise.

17:52.838 --> 17:56.373
You don't think mine are limited
to writing cheques, do you?

17:56.467 --> 17:58.673
In another life...

17:59.553 --> 18:05.259
I arranged a number of operations of...
questionable legality.

18:07.853 --> 18:10.226
I'd take his word for it, if I were you.

18:12.191 --> 18:16.403
So don't worry.
I'll make all the arrangements.

18:18.114 --> 18:19.193
No.

18:24.870 --> 18:27.575
I'd really need your help here.

18:27.665 --> 18:33.205
Lan... I'm not gonna let you steal
the Declaration of Independence.

18:33.295 --> 18:35.502
OK.

18:35.589 --> 18:38.923
From this point on
all you're going to be is a hindrance.

18:41.721 --> 18:42.503
Hey!

18:42.596 --> 18:46.546
What are you gonna do?
Are you gonna shoot me, Shaw?

18:47.184 --> 18:49.936
Well, you can't shoot me.
There's more to the riddle.

18:50.021 --> 18:53.271
Information you don't have. I do.

18:53.357 --> 18:56.394
I'm the only one who can figure it out,
and you know that.

18:56.485 --> 18:58.811
He's bluffing.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.574
We played poker together, lan.
You know I can't bluff.

19:01.657 --> 19:03.982
Tell me what I need to know, Ben,

19:04.076 --> 19:06.365
or I'll shoot your friend.

19:06.454 --> 19:07.864
Hey!

19:07.955 --> 19:10.274
Quiet, Riley!
Your job's finished here.

19:14.956 --> 19:19.168
Look where you're standing.
All that gunpowder.

19:19.252 --> 19:23.084
You shoot me,
I drop this, we all go up.

19:24.507 --> 19:25.836
Ben...

19:27.135 --> 19:30.255
What happens when the flare burns down?

19:31.848 --> 19:34.469
Tell me what I need to know, Ben.

19:36.478 --> 19:38.102
You need to know...

19:38.188 --> 19:40.145
if Shaw can catch.

19:46.029 --> 19:47.689
Nice try, though.

19:59.042 --> 20:01.035
Get out, Shaw!

20:09.678 --> 20:11.338
Fool!

20:15.725 --> 20:17.517
Riley, get over here!

20:22.983 --> 20:25.520
- What is this?
- Smuggler's hold. Get in!

20:31.074 --> 20:32.485
Move! Get out of here!

20:32.575 --> 20:34.200
- What?
- Move! Get out!

20:35.412 --> 20:37.404
Follow me.

20:41.042 --> 20:42.869
Let's go, let's go!
She's gonna blow!

20:49.920 --> 20:52.127
Get down.

21:23.078 --> 21:26.613
OK, let's go.
Before someone sees the smoke.

21:57.321 --> 22:00.357
There's an Inuit village
about nine miles east of here.

22:00.449 --> 22:04.494
- It's popular with bush pilots.
- All right.

22:09.416 --> 22:13.034
- Then what are we gonna do?
- Start making our way back home.

22:13.128 --> 22:17.458
No, I meant about lan. He's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence, Ben.

22:18.717 --> 22:20.342
We stop him.

22:38.481 --> 22:39.761
Is it really so hard to believe

22:39.857 --> 22:42.313
that someone's gonna try to steal
the Declaration of Independence?

22:42.402 --> 22:44.857
The FBI gets 10,000 tips a week.

22:44.946 --> 22:47.318
They're not gonna worry about
something they're sure is safe.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.945
But anyone that can do anything
is gonna think we're crazy.

22:50.034 --> 22:53.154
Anyone crazy enough to believe us
isn't gonna want to help.

22:53.246 --> 22:58.038
We don't need someone crazy. But one
step short of crazy, what do you get?

22:58.126 --> 22:59.786
Obsessed.

22:59.877 --> 23:01.537
Passionate.

23:09.345 --> 23:11.670
Excuse me.

23:16.311 --> 23:18.884
- Dr Chase can see you now, Mr Brown.
- Thank you.

23:18.980 --> 23:20.260
Mr Brown?

23:20.356 --> 23:23.690
The family name doesn't get a lot
of respect in the academic community.

23:23.776 --> 23:25.852
Huh. Being kept down by the man.

23:28.281 --> 23:30.190
A very cute man.

23:30.283 --> 23:32.572
Thank you.

23:32.660 --> 23:34.867
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.
- Hi.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.578
- Abigail Chase.
- Paul Brown.

23:37.665 --> 23:40.037
- Nice to meet you.
- Bill.

23:40.501 --> 23:42.624
Nice to meet you, Bill.

23:42.712 --> 23:45.962
- How may I help you?
- Your accent. Pennsylvania Dutch?

23:46.049 --> 23:48.172
Saxony German.

23:49.052 --> 23:51.887
- You're not American?
- Oh, I am an American.

23:51.971 --> 23:55.008
I just wasn't born here.
Please don't touch that!

23:55.099 --> 23:58.682
Sorry. A neat collection.
George Washington's campaign buttons.

23:58.770 --> 24:01.391
You're missing the 1789 inaugural, though.

24:01.481 --> 24:04.482
- I found one once.
- That's very fortunate for you.

24:04.567 --> 24:07.521
Now, you told my assistant
that this was an urgent matter.

24:07.612 --> 24:09.735
Yes, ma'am.

24:09.817 --> 24:12.568
Well, I'm gonna get straight to the point.

24:14.237 --> 24:17.523
Someone's gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

24:20.077 --> 24:22.200
It's true.

24:23.789 --> 24:25.912
I think I'd better put you gentlemen
in touch with the FBI.

24:25.999 --> 24:27.873
- We've been to the FBI.
- And?

24:27.960 --> 24:31.329
They assured us that the Declaration
cannot possibly be stolen.

24:31.421 --> 24:33.995
- They're right.
- My friend and I are less certain.

24:34.091 --> 24:38.040
However, if we were given the privilege
of examining the document...

24:38.845 --> 24:42.795
we would be able to tell you for certain
if it were actually in any danger.

24:42.891 --> 24:44.931
What do you think you're gonna find?

24:45.018 --> 24:51.520
We believe that there's an...
encryption on the back.

24:52.025 --> 24:54.896
- An encryption, like a code?
- Yes, ma'am.

24:54.987 --> 24:56.979
Of what?

24:57.072 --> 25:00.073
A... cartograph.

25:00.158 --> 25:02.400
- A map.
- Yes, ma'am.

25:02.911 --> 25:05.663
A map of what?

25:05.747 --> 25:07.740
The location of...

25:08.417 --> 25:16.329
...of hidden items
of historic and intrinsic value.

25:17.926 --> 25:21.425
- A treasure map?
- That's where we lost the FBI.

25:21.513 --> 25:24.431
You're treasure-hunters, aren't you?

25:24.516 --> 25:26.841
We're more like treasure-protectors.

25:27.477 --> 25:32.020
Mr Brown, I have personally seen the back
of the Declaration of Independence,

25:32.107 --> 25:36.401
and I promise you, the only thing there
is a notation that reads,

25:36.486 --> 25:38.444
"Original Declaration of Independence,
dated...

25:38.530 --> 25:41.365
"Four of July, 1776." Yes, ma'am.

25:41.450 --> 25:43.276
But no map.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.742
It's invisible.

25:58.836 --> 26:00.627
Oh! Right.

26:00.963 --> 26:05.091
And that's where we lost
the Department of Homeland Security.

26:05.176 --> 26:08.379
What led you to assume
there's this invisible map?

26:08.804 --> 26:11.805
We found an engraving
on the stem of a 200-year-old pipe.

26:11.891 --> 26:14.298
Owned by Freemasons.

26:14.393 --> 26:18.687
- May I see the pipe?
- We don't have it.

26:20.733 --> 26:24.184
- Did Big Foot take it?
- It was nice meeting you.

26:24.779 --> 26:26.855
Nice to meet you, too.

26:27.573 --> 26:29.945
And, you know,
that really is a nice collection.

26:30.034 --> 26:33.367
Must have taken you a long time
to hunt down all that history.

26:37.500 --> 26:40.703
If it's any consolation,
you had me convinced.

26:40.795 --> 26:43.250
It's not.

26:43.339 --> 26:47.123
I was thinking, what if we go public,
plaster the story all over the Internet?

26:47.218 --> 26:51.595
It's not like
we have our reputations to worry about.

26:51.681 --> 26:55.513
Although I don't think
that's exactly gonna scare lan away.

26:56.686 --> 27:00.137
180 years of searching,
and I'm three feet away.

27:00.231 --> 27:02.804
Of all the words
written here about freedom,

27:02.900 --> 27:06.565
there's a line here
that's at the heart of all the others.

27:06.654 --> 27:10.153
"But when a long train of abuses
and usurpations,

27:10.241 --> 27:12.910
pursuing invariably the same object,

27:12.994 --> 27:16.943
evinces a design to reduce them
under absolute despotism,

27:17.039 --> 27:20.954
it is their right, it is their duty
to throw off such government

27:21.043 --> 27:24.543
and provide new guards
for their future security."

27:26.340 --> 27:28.582
People don't talk that way any more.

27:28.676 --> 27:30.709
Beautiful, huh?

27:32.257 --> 27:35.293
- No idea what you said.
- It means, if there's something wrong,

27:35.385 --> 27:39.714
those who have the ability to take action
have the responsibility to take action.

27:44.769 --> 27:46.727
I'm gonna steal it.

27:50.025 --> 27:51.768
What?

27:51.860 --> 27:55.110
I'm gonna steal
the Declaration of Independence.

28:00.327 --> 28:02.070
Ben?

28:02.996 --> 28:05.404
This is... huge.

28:05.999 --> 28:08.620
It's prison huge.

28:08.710 --> 28:11.035
You are gonna go to prison,
you know that?

28:11.129 --> 28:13.537
Yeah, probably.

28:13.632 --> 28:16.169
So that would bother most people.

28:16.801 --> 28:21.510
Lan's gonna try and steal it. And if he
succeeds, he'll destroy the Declaration.

28:21.598 --> 28:24.967
The fact is, the only way to protect
the Declaration is to steal it.

28:25.060 --> 28:27.633
It's upside down.

28:29.022 --> 28:31.430
I don't think there's a choice.

28:32.192 --> 28:34.647
Ben, for God's sakes,

28:34.736 --> 28:38.354
it's like stealing a national monument. OK?

28:38.448 --> 28:40.606
It's like stealing him.

28:40.700 --> 28:45.446
It can't be done. Not shouldn't be done.
It can't be done.

28:46.873 --> 28:49.245
Let me prove it to you.

28:49.334 --> 28:52.003
OK, Ben, pay attention.

28:52.087 --> 28:54.957
I've brought you to the Library of Congress.

28:55.048 --> 28:58.666
Why? Because it's the biggest library
in the world.

28:58.760 --> 29:00.918
Over 20 million books.

29:01.012 --> 29:03.468
And they're all saying
the same exact thing:

29:03.556 --> 29:05.882
Listen to Riley.

29:05.976 --> 29:10.715
What we have here, my friend,
is an entire layout of the archives.

29:10.808 --> 29:13.263
Short of builders' blueprints.

29:13.352 --> 29:17.397
You've got construction orders,
phone lines,

29:18.274 --> 29:21.109
water and sewage -
it's all here.

29:21.193 --> 29:24.277
Now, when the Declaration
is on display, OK,

29:24.363 --> 29:27.946
it is surrounded by guards
and video monitors

29:28.033 --> 29:31.983
and a little family from lowa and little kids
on their eighth-grade field trip.

29:32.079 --> 29:36.824
And beneath an inch of bulletproof glass
is an army of sensors and heat monitors

29:36.917 --> 29:40.251
that will go off if someone gets too close
with a high fever.

29:41.088 --> 29:43.709
Now, when it's not on display,

29:44.633 --> 29:51.846
it is lowered into a four-foot-thick
concrete, steel-plated vault...

29:52.516 --> 29:56.977
that happens to be equipped
with an electronic combination lock

29:57.062 --> 29:59.102
and biometric access-denial systems.

29:59.189 --> 30:02.938
You know, Thomas Edison tried and failed
nearly 2,000 times

30:03.027 --> 30:06.941
to develop the carbonised cotton-thread
filament for the incandescent light bulb.

30:07.031 --> 30:08.406
Edison?

30:08.490 --> 30:10.566
When asked about it,
he said, "I didn't fail,

30:10.659 --> 30:13.446
I found out 2,000 ways
how not to make a light bulb."

30:13.537 --> 30:16.906
But he only needed to find one way
to make it work.

30:19.084 --> 30:22.251
The Preservation Room.
Enjoy. Go ahead.

30:24.173 --> 30:26.960
Do you know
what the Preservation Room is for?

30:27.051 --> 30:29.542
Delicious jams and jellies?

30:29.637 --> 30:32.306
No. That's where they clean,
repair and maintain

30:32.389 --> 30:34.216
all the documents
and the storage housings

30:34.308 --> 30:36.514
when they're not on display or in the vault.

30:36.602 --> 30:40.896
Now, when the case needs work they take
it out of the vault, directly across the hall

30:40.981 --> 30:42.773
and into the Preservation Room.

30:42.858 --> 30:46.772
The best time for us, or lan, to steal it
would be during the gala this weekend

30:46.862 --> 30:49.976
when the guards are distracted
by the VIPs upstairs.

30:50.068 --> 30:56.153
But we'll make our way to the Preservation
Room, where there's much less security.

30:59.035 --> 31:01.407
Well, if lan...

31:03.581 --> 31:05.704
Preservation...

31:06.250 --> 31:08.290
The gala, huh?

31:10.338 --> 31:12.663
This might be possible.

31:13.424 --> 31:15.216
It might.

31:49.043 --> 31:51.415
And we are in.

32:03.266 --> 32:06.101
There you are. Hello.

32:10.148 --> 32:12.140
The hallway.

32:18.406 --> 32:20.066
That's what I want.

32:33.749 --> 32:35.741
Game on.

33:10.077 --> 33:11.487
I'll buy that.

33:16.708 --> 33:18.202
Cool.

33:50.075 --> 33:52.364
This just came for you.

33:52.995 --> 33:55.486
I hope it's not from Stan.

33:57.583 --> 34:02.209
"For the woman who has everything else...
Thanks for listening. Paul Brown."

34:46.918 --> 34:48.542
Abigail Chase.

35:04.644 --> 35:05.723
Hey, Mike.

35:09.941 --> 35:12.610
- Let's do this by the book.
- Hallway is secure.

35:12.693 --> 35:15.065
- Keep the document level.
- No problem.

35:15.863 --> 35:16.859
What have you got?

35:16.948 --> 35:18.905
The heat sensor went off
in the Declaration frame.

35:18.991 --> 35:22.574
Run full diagnostics,
then I want them all changed out.

35:22.662 --> 35:25.331
Our evil plan is working.

36:05.031 --> 36:07.071
Ben, are you sure that we should...?

36:10.537 --> 36:11.865
Riley.

36:12.414 --> 36:14.786
- Can you hear me?
- Unfortunately, yeah.

36:14.874 --> 36:16.582
We're all set in here.

36:16.668 --> 36:19.954
You want to go around to the front
and present your invitation.

36:20.046 --> 36:22.881
You're gonna have to show ID.
Go ahead, man.

36:27.262 --> 36:29.301
Howdy.

36:33.685 --> 36:37.350
I need your invitation
and your ID, please.

36:55.582 --> 36:57.824
How do you look?

36:57.918 --> 37:01.002
- Not bad.
- Mazel tov.

37:08.303 --> 37:10.342
This is it.

37:43.040 --> 37:45.578
For you.

37:45.668 --> 37:48.040
- Oh, Mr Brown.
- Dr Chase.

37:48.128 --> 37:51.497
- What are you doing here?
- Is that that hot girl?

37:51.590 --> 37:56.667
- How does she look?
- I made a last-minute donation. A big one.

37:56.762 --> 37:59.431
Well, on that subject,
thank you for your wonderful gift.

37:59.515 --> 38:02.469
- Oh, you did get it? Good.
- Yes, thank you.

38:02.559 --> 38:06.688
You know, I really couldn't accept
something like that normally, but...

38:06.772 --> 38:08.765
I really want it.

38:08.857 --> 38:12.108
- Well, you needed it.
- Come on, Romeo, get outta there.

38:12.194 --> 38:16.192
I have been wondering, though,
what the engraving indicated

38:16.282 --> 38:18.025
on the pipe that Big Foot took.

38:18.117 --> 38:19.528
Hi.

38:19.952 --> 38:24.246
- Here you go.
- Oh, Dr Herbert, this is Mr Brown.

38:24.331 --> 38:25.446
- Hi.
- Hi there.

38:25.541 --> 38:29.040
- Who's the stiff?
- Here, why don't you let me take that?

38:29.128 --> 38:32.710
- So you can take that off his hands.
- Thank you.

38:33.799 --> 38:35.957
A toast, yeah?

38:36.051 --> 38:38.174
To high treason.

38:38.262 --> 38:41.631
That's what these men were committing
when they signed the Declaration.

38:41.724 --> 38:46.966
Had we lost the war, they would have been
hanged, beheaded, drawn and quartered,

38:47.062 --> 38:51.523
and - Oh! Oh, my personal favourite -
and had their entrails cut out and burned!

38:53.736 --> 38:58.694
So, here's to the men
who did what was considered wrong

38:58.782 --> 39:01.902
in order to do what they knew was right.

39:03.203 --> 39:05.030
What they knew was right.

39:16.544 --> 39:18.418
Well, good night.

39:18.504 --> 39:20.711
- Good night.
- Good night.

39:36.814 --> 39:39.187
Yeah!

39:40.818 --> 39:42.017
OK, go! Go!

39:54.832 --> 39:56.540
This better work.

40:02.924 --> 40:03.624
Clear!

40:09.097 --> 40:12.596
- On.
- Door one. 30 seconds.

40:21.442 --> 40:23.482
How does it look?

40:25.572 --> 40:28.857
It's working.
It's working...

40:28.950 --> 40:30.325
Unbelievable.

40:51.425 --> 40:53.298
Second door. 90 seconds.

41:06.231 --> 41:08.901
Well done, boys. Let's go.

41:21.955 --> 41:24.446
- We're in the elevator.
- OK.

41:24.541 --> 41:26.748
I'm gonna turn off
the surveillance cameras. Ready?

41:27.377 --> 41:29.785
In five, four,

41:29.880 --> 41:32.038
three... Now.

41:33.884 --> 41:35.164
Ben Gates,

41:35.260 --> 41:37.930
you are now the Invisible Man.

41:43.060 --> 41:45.847
- I'm here.
- Give me the letters for her password.

41:45.938 --> 41:48.096
What do you got for me?

41:50.817 --> 41:52.525
Hit me with it.

41:52.611 --> 41:54.568
A-E-F-G...

41:54.655 --> 41:57.656
L-O-R-V-Y.

41:58.116 --> 42:01.117
Anagrams being listed.

42:01.203 --> 42:03.242
OK.

42:03.330 --> 42:05.999
Top results: "A glove fry."

42:06.083 --> 42:07.625
"A very golf."

42:07.709 --> 42:09.583
"Fargo levy."

42:09.670 --> 42:11.911
"Gravy floe. Valey frog."

42:12.005 --> 42:14.923
Also "Ago fly rev."

42:15.759 --> 42:17.337
"Grove fly a."

42:17.427 --> 42:19.254
"Are fly gov."

42:19.346 --> 42:21.552
"Era fly gov."

42:21.640 --> 42:24.012
- "Elf gov ray."
- It's "Valley Forge".

42:24.935 --> 42:27.508
"Valley For..."
I don't have that on my computer.

42:27.604 --> 42:29.680
It's "Valley Forge" -
she pressed the E and L twice.

42:29.770 --> 42:32.602
Valley Forge was a turning point
in the American Revolution.

42:32.687 --> 42:35.225
Can I marry your brain?

42:39.610 --> 42:41.603
We're in.

42:45.575 --> 42:47.117
Hello.

42:52.873 --> 42:54.950
Ben, you're doing great.

43:03.718 --> 43:05.757
Ben, pick it up.

43:14.478 --> 43:16.471
You got about one...

43:21.152 --> 43:22.527
We own video.

43:23.321 --> 43:25.859
- I lost my feed.
- What?

43:25.948 --> 43:27.775
I lost my feed, Ben.

43:27.867 --> 43:29.906
I don't know where anyone is.
I have nothing.

43:29.994 --> 43:31.536
Ben, I have no...
Ben, I have nothing.

43:31.621 --> 43:34.325
Get out of there.
Get out of there now.

43:34.415 --> 43:36.953
I'm taking the whole thing.
I'll get it out in the elevator.

43:37.043 --> 43:39.794
What are you talking about?
Is it heavy?

43:45.301 --> 43:47.874
Shaw. Door three, one minute.

44:03.819 --> 44:05.362
Gates.

44:09.861 --> 44:12.020
What was that?

44:14.115 --> 44:15.989
Who's shooting?

44:17.619 --> 44:19.861
- Damn.
- He's got the bloody map!

44:20.330 --> 44:22.999
Are you still there? Ben?

44:23.083 --> 44:24.707
I'm in the elevator.

44:25.293 --> 44:30.501
- Lan's here. There was, uh, shooting.
- I hate that guy.

44:35.178 --> 44:39.721
Hey, Rebecca.
Do you have a Paul Brown on that list?

44:39.808 --> 44:41.267
Paul Brown?

44:41.351 --> 44:42.929
No. Not here.

44:56.616 --> 44:58.490
Have a good night.

45:05.584 --> 45:08.538
Are you trying to steal that?

45:13.592 --> 45:15.300
It's $35.

45:16.887 --> 45:19.128
- For this?
- Yeah.

45:19.222 --> 45:22.389
- That's a lot.
- Hey, I don't make the prices.

45:25.312 --> 45:26.426
It's...

45:29.774 --> 45:31.399
I have $32...

45:35.614 --> 45:37.440
57 c.

45:38.116 --> 45:40.607
We take Visa.

45:50.216 --> 45:52.588
This is Mike. Sublevel three.
I have an alert.

45:52.677 --> 45:55.382
Where are you, Ben?

46:19.954 --> 46:22.527
- Where are you?
- Stop talking.

46:24.041 --> 46:26.283
Start the van.

46:32.508 --> 46:37.716
Ben, the...
the mean Declaration lady's behind you.

46:42.518 --> 46:44.262
Hey.

46:44.353 --> 46:46.891
Oh, it's you. Hello.

46:46.981 --> 46:49.733
Mr Brown, what's going on?
What's that?

46:50.610 --> 46:52.898
- It's a souvenir.
- Really?

46:52.987 --> 46:55.027
Stop chatting and get in the van.

47:00.828 --> 47:02.785
Code red. Code red.
We have a break-in.

47:02.872 --> 47:06.739
Lock it down. Nobody leaves the building.
Get the FBI on the phone.

47:10.922 --> 47:13.543
- Did you enjoy the party?
- Yeah.

47:17.553 --> 47:20.554
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God! You did not...?

47:21.224 --> 47:23.347
- No...
- Security! Over here!

47:23.434 --> 47:25.427
- Give me that!
- It's yours. Take it.

47:26.103 --> 47:27.811
Security!

47:27.897 --> 47:31.805
- Over here! Security!
- Got you.

47:32.562 --> 47:33.558
Go.

47:33.647 --> 47:35.686
Viktor! Move!

47:35.774 --> 47:37.850
- We can't just let her go!
- We can. Go!

47:39.236 --> 47:41.905
- Security, over here!
- Wait. No, hold it.

47:41.988 --> 47:43.613
Hold it!

47:45.826 --> 47:46.821
- Wha...?
- Oh, bad.

47:46.910 --> 47:48.369
- What do you want?
- Give me the document.

47:48.453 --> 47:50.446
Bad, bad, bad!

47:54.251 --> 47:56.042
- Let me go!
- Just bring her!

47:56.128 --> 47:57.538
No! No!

48:04.636 --> 48:06.427
- That's...
- Go! Go!

48:16.314 --> 48:18.390
And just who might you be?

48:21.987 --> 48:24.941
- Once we catch them what do we do?
- I'm working on it.

48:26.867 --> 48:28.277
Right turn, right turn.

48:29.995 --> 48:33.743
Why don't you just pass me that
document? Then we can all go home.

48:46.011 --> 48:47.469
Oh, no.

49:02.152 --> 49:03.646
Skidding, skidding, skidding.

49:10.321 --> 49:12.527
- Oh, no!
- Holy Lord!

49:16.994 --> 49:20.861
- Help!
- No! If she falls, the document falls.

49:22.124 --> 49:24.081
Get me next to her.

49:45.064 --> 49:46.973
- Thank you.
- No!

49:47.066 --> 49:49.687
Got it. Go on.

49:50.653 --> 49:52.396
Abigail!

49:54.115 --> 49:56.072
Come on. Jump.

50:05.251 --> 50:09.794
- We lost them.
- That's all right. This... is what we need.

50:20.057 --> 50:22.726
Well done, Gates. Well done.

50:25.187 --> 50:27.809
- Are you all right?
- No! Those lunatics...

50:27.898 --> 50:30.436
- You're not hurt, are you?
- You are all lunatics!

50:30.526 --> 50:32.068
- Are you hungry?
- What?

50:32.153 --> 50:33.528
Are you all right?

50:33.612 --> 50:37.562
Still a little on edge from being shot at,
but I'll be OK. Thanks for asking.

50:37.658 --> 50:41.359
Yeah, well, I'm not all right. Those men
have the Declaration of Independence!

50:41.454 --> 50:44.657
- She lost it?
- They don't have it.

50:46.417 --> 50:49.994
See? OK?
Now could you please stop shouting?

50:51.082 --> 50:54.617
- Give me that!
- You're still shouting. It's starting to annoy.

50:55.170 --> 50:58.621
You'd do well, Dr Chase,
to be a bit more civilised in this instance.

50:58.923 --> 51:01.628
If this is the real one, what did they get?

51:02.010 --> 51:03.801
A souvenir.

51:03.887 --> 51:07.505
I thought it'd be a good idea to have
a duplicate. It turned out I was right.

51:07.932 --> 51:14.302
I actually had to pay for the souvenir and
the real one, so you owe me $35, plus tax.

51:14.773 --> 51:17.690
- Genius.
- Who were those men?

51:17.776 --> 51:20.183
Just the guys we warned you
were gonna steal the Declaration.

51:20.278 --> 51:22.152
And you didn't believe us.

51:22.238 --> 51:24.812
We did the only thing we could do
to keep it safe.

51:26.034 --> 51:27.528
Verdammt! Give me that!

51:27.619 --> 51:29.907
You know something?
You're shouting again.

51:29.996 --> 51:31.953
I'm pretty sure she was swearing, too.

51:32.040 --> 51:35.124
Well, we probably deserve that.

51:41.674 --> 51:43.833
Ladies and gentlemen...

51:43.927 --> 51:48.256
Ladies and gentlemen, my name is
Peter Sadusky. I'm the agent in charge.

51:48.348 --> 51:51.432
I wanna reassure you,
you are not in danger in any way.

51:51.518 --> 51:56.310
If we all cooperate, we'll get through this
with as little frustration as possible.

51:56.773 --> 51:58.765
Thank you.

52:00.026 --> 52:04.735
Get positive IDs. Search everyone,
including the security staff.

52:04.823 --> 52:07.610
If they refuse,
detain them and get warrants.

52:07.700 --> 52:10.191
Yes, Agent Hendricks?
You have something?

52:10.954 --> 52:11.618
Um...

52:11.704 --> 52:16.165
- This isn't a day for "Um..."
- We got a tip several days ago

52:16.251 --> 52:19.287
that someone was going to steal
the Declaration of Independence.

52:19.379 --> 52:22.296
Do we have a name on the tipster?

52:22.382 --> 52:25.965
There was no file opened.
We didn't find the information credible.

52:27.595 --> 52:29.303
How about now?

52:29.389 --> 52:33.427
There is not a treasure map on the back
of the Declaration of Independence.

52:33.512 --> 52:37.426
And there's no chance
anyone can steal this either.

52:38.434 --> 52:41.803
I levelled with you 100 per cent.
Everything I told you was the truth.

52:41.895 --> 52:44.102
I want that document, Mr Brown.

52:44.481 --> 52:47.186
OK, my name's not Brown.
It's Gates.

52:47.276 --> 52:49.648
I levelled with you 98 per cent.

52:49.736 --> 52:52.406
Wait a minute, did you just say "Gates"?

52:53.449 --> 52:55.073
Gates?

52:55.159 --> 52:58.693
You're that family with the conspiracy
theory about the Founding Fathers?

52:58.787 --> 53:02.121
- It's not a conspiracy theory.
- Per se.

53:02.207 --> 53:06.039
You know what? I take it back.
You're not liars. You're insane.

53:06.128 --> 53:08.334
There's a copy of the Declaration
on display now?

53:08.422 --> 53:10.580
- Yes, we decided to...
- Leave it there.

53:10.674 --> 53:13.295
The guests know something happened,
but they don't know what.

53:13.385 --> 53:16.552
They got him with a Taser at the service
entrance. He doesn't remember a thing.

53:16.638 --> 53:18.761
Also, we found bullet casings.

53:18.849 --> 53:20.473
Did we get a description
from the other guards?

53:20.559 --> 53:23.560
- Which guards?
- The guards that were fired upon.

53:23.645 --> 53:27.773
There weren't any other guards
on patrol down here.

53:28.108 --> 53:30.267
So...

53:30.360 --> 53:33.564
who was shooting,
who were they shooting at,

53:33.655 --> 53:35.981
and why weren't they getting along?

53:36.074 --> 53:38.910
You can't seriously intend
to run chemical tests

53:38.994 --> 53:42.161
on the Declaration of Independence
in the back of a moving van.

53:42.247 --> 53:43.907
We have a clean-room environment
all set up.

53:43.999 --> 53:47.202
EDS suits, a particulate air filtration
system, the whole shebang.

53:47.294 --> 53:49.832
- Really?
- We can't go back there.

53:49.922 --> 53:51.665
What? Why not?

53:51.757 --> 53:55.589
This is the guy. Dr Herbert said
Dr Chase introduced him as Mr Brown.

53:55.677 --> 53:56.958
Not on the guestlist.

53:57.054 --> 54:01.182
Now, the gift-store clerk - she said
he seemed... Well, she said "flustered".

54:01.266 --> 54:04.220
He tried to walk out with a copy
of the Declaration of Independence

54:04.311 --> 54:06.268
without paying.

54:06.355 --> 54:08.312
He paid with a Visa.

54:08.398 --> 54:11.559
"Charge to Benjamin Gates."

54:11.646 --> 54:14.351
A credit-card slip?

54:14.440 --> 54:16.100
Dude, we're on the grid.

54:16.192 --> 54:19.027
They'll have your records from forever.
They'll have my records from forever.

54:19.112 --> 54:22.646
I know. I know. It's only a matter of minutes
before the FBI shows up at my front door.

54:22.740 --> 54:24.780
What do we do?

54:24.867 --> 54:27.785
- We need those letters.
- What letters?

54:30.081 --> 54:32.038
You know, get off the road,
take a right.

54:32.125 --> 54:33.951
What letters?

54:34.836 --> 54:39.877
You have the original Silence Dogood
letters? Did you steal those, too?

54:39.966 --> 54:42.042
We have scans of the originals.

54:42.135 --> 54:44.970
- Quiet, please.
- How'd you get scans?

54:45.054 --> 54:48.589
Oh, I know the person
who has the originals. Now shush.

54:51.644 --> 54:56.021
- Why do you need them?
- She really can't shut her mouth, can she?

54:56.107 --> 54:59.807
I'll tell you what, look.
I will let you hold onto this

54:59.902 --> 55:02.689
if you'll promise to shut up, please.

55:02.780 --> 55:05.318
Thank you.

55:06.033 --> 55:08.441
- Ben, you know what you have to do.
- I know what to do.

55:08.536 --> 55:11.241
I'm just trying to think
of anything else we could do.

55:11.330 --> 55:14.035
Well, not to be a... nudge,

55:14.125 --> 55:18.123
but you do realise how many people
we have after us.

55:18.212 --> 55:21.498
We probably have
our own satellite by now.

55:22.675 --> 55:28.132
It took you all of two seconds to decide
to steal the Declaration of Independence.

55:28.222 --> 55:32.137
Yeah, but I didn't think I was gonna
personally have to tell my dad about it.

55:32.226 --> 55:34.896
Hey, not cool! Not cool!

55:34.979 --> 55:37.055
Let me go!

55:37.148 --> 55:39.437
OK. You're let go. Go, shoo.

55:39.525 --> 55:41.814
I'm not going. Not without the Declaration.

55:41.903 --> 55:44.820
You're not going with the Declaration.

55:44.906 --> 55:48.571
Yes, I am. I'm not letting it
out of my sight, so I'm going.

55:48.659 --> 55:51.857
Wait. You're not going with us
with the Declaration.

55:51.948 --> 55:55.234
- Yes, I am.
- No, you're not.

55:56.286 --> 55:58.492
Look, if you wanted to leave me behind,

55:58.580 --> 56:02.031
you shouldn't have told me
where you were going.

56:17.724 --> 56:19.717
Clear.

56:20.435 --> 56:22.724
What the...

56:24.147 --> 56:26.899
Now we're getting somewhere.

56:27.859 --> 56:31.691
They're digital scans of letters
to the editor of The New England Courant.

56:31.780 --> 56:34.485
Written 1722.

56:34.574 --> 56:38.904
They're all from the same person.
"Your humble servant, Silence Dogood."

56:54.511 --> 56:56.468
Gentlemen...

56:56.555 --> 57:00.766
why is this word capitalised?

57:01.810 --> 57:04.645
Because it's important?

57:06.857 --> 57:09.182
Because it's a name.

57:09.276 --> 57:12.277
OK, I got it.
When Ben Franklin was only 15 years old

57:12.362 --> 57:15.280
he secretly wrote 14 letters
to his brother's newspaper

57:15.365 --> 57:19.030
pretending to be a middle-aged widow
named Silence Dogood.

57:19.119 --> 57:21.824
These letters were written
by Benjamin Franklin.

57:28.795 --> 57:31.161
Looks OK.

57:31.250 --> 57:33.871
- Park a couple of blocks away.
- Well, how long do you think we got?

57:33.961 --> 57:37.544
I'm gonna give them a couple of hours
at least. I hope.

57:37.631 --> 57:41.629
What do we do about her?
I've got some duct tape in the back.

57:41.719 --> 57:43.961
No, that won't be necessary.
She won't be any trouble.

57:44.054 --> 57:47.258
- Promise you won't be any trouble.
- I promise.

57:47.349 --> 57:49.307
See? She's curious.

57:53.105 --> 57:57.601
Here's what I got on Gates. A degree
in American History from Georgetown,

57:57.693 --> 57:59.852
a degree in Mechanical Engineering
at MIT,

57:59.945 --> 58:04.488
Navy ROTC and Naval Diving
and Salvage Training Centre.

58:05.201 --> 58:07.905
What in the world did this guy
want to be when he grew up?

58:07.995 --> 58:09.988
We keep our focus on Gates.

58:10.081 --> 58:12.369
Run him to ground.

58:12.458 --> 58:16.242
Compile a family-and-friends list.
Closest relative first.

58:16.712 --> 58:19.464
I want to find out who this guy is.

58:28.182 --> 58:29.462
Dad.

58:31.852 --> 58:33.845
Where's the party?

58:34.396 --> 58:38.180
Well... I'm in a little trouble.

58:39.235 --> 58:41.856
- Is she pregnant?
- Well, if she is,

58:41.946 --> 58:46.406
are you gonna leave the woman carrying
your grandchild standing out in the cold?

58:46.492 --> 58:48.864
I look pregnant?

58:53.582 --> 58:56.832
This better not be about
that dumb treasure.

59:02.091 --> 59:04.712
Well, have a seat.
Make yourselves comfortable.

59:04.802 --> 59:08.669
There's some pizza.
It's still warm, I think.

59:08.764 --> 59:10.300
Dad...

59:12.303 --> 59:17.215
I need the Silence Dogood letters.
Yeah, it's about the treasure.

59:17.308 --> 59:19.348
And he dragged you two
into this nonsense?

59:19.436 --> 59:21.891
- Literally.
- I volunteered.

59:21.980 --> 59:25.183
Well, unvolunteer,
before you waste your life.

59:25.275 --> 59:28.311
- Knock it off, Dad.
- Sure, sure, I know, I'm the family kook.

59:28.403 --> 59:30.645
I have a job, a house, health insurance.

59:30.739 --> 59:34.902
At least I had your mother, for however
brief a time. At least I had you.

59:34.993 --> 59:37.282
What do you have? Him?

59:39.497 --> 59:42.664
Look, if you just give us the letters,
we're gone.

59:42.751 --> 59:44.660
You disappoint me, Ben.

59:44.753 --> 59:49.829
Well, maybe that's the real Gates-family
legacy. Sons who disappoint their fathers.

59:51.342 --> 59:53.964
Get out. Take your troubles with you.

59:59.392 --> 01:00:01.883
I found the Charlotte.

01:00:06.316 --> 01:00:08.308
The Charlotte?

01:00:09.152 --> 01:00:12.022
- You mean she was a ship?
- Yeah, she was beautiful.

01:00:12.113 --> 01:00:13.109
It was amazing, Dad.

01:00:13.198 --> 01:00:15.949
And the treasure?

01:00:16.034 --> 01:00:18.786
No, no. But we found another clue
that led us here.

01:00:18.870 --> 01:00:21.539
Yeah, and that'll lead you
to another clue.

01:00:21.623 --> 01:00:24.196
And that's all you'll ever find,
is another clue. Don't you get it, Ben?

01:00:24.292 --> 01:00:25.751
I finally figured it out.

01:00:25.835 --> 01:00:29.038
The legend says that the treasure
was buried to keep it from the British.

01:00:29.130 --> 01:00:31.882
But what really happened
was the legend was invented,

01:00:31.966 --> 01:00:36.213
to keep the British occupied
searching for buried treasure.

01:00:36.304 --> 01:00:39.554
The treasure is a myth.

01:00:39.641 --> 01:00:41.966
I refuse to believe that.

01:00:47.190 --> 01:00:51.431
Well, you can believe what you want.
You're a grown person. What am I doing?

01:00:51.522 --> 01:00:54.772
Do what you want, Ben.
Do what you want.

01:00:56.276 --> 01:01:01.022
He's probably right. You don't even know
if there is another clue.

01:01:03.075 --> 01:01:07.571
Well, I can think of a way where we could
find out. And we can find out right now.

01:01:25.722 --> 01:01:27.799
Looks like animal skin.

01:01:28.475 --> 01:01:31.595
- How old is it?
- At least 200 years.

01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:35.387
- Really? You sure?
- Pretty darn.

01:01:35.482 --> 01:01:37.973
Now if this thing's in invisible ink,
how do we look at it?

01:01:38.068 --> 01:01:39.349
Throw it in the oven.

01:01:39.445 --> 01:01:41.022
- No.
- Uh-uh.

01:01:41.113 --> 01:01:43.782
Ferrous sulphate inks
can only be brought out with heat.

01:01:43.866 --> 01:01:47.032
- Yes, but this...
- It's very old.

01:01:47.119 --> 01:01:52.825
This is very old, and we can't
risk compromising the map.

01:01:52.916 --> 01:01:54.079
You need a reagent.

01:01:54.168 --> 01:01:56.872
Dad, it's really late.
Why don't you get some rest?

01:01:56.962 --> 01:01:59.453
I'm fine.

01:01:59.548 --> 01:02:01.375
Lemons.

01:02:07.973 --> 01:02:10.298
- You can't do that.
- But it has to be done.

01:02:10.392 --> 01:02:14.639
Then someone who is trained to handle
antique documents is gonna do it.

01:02:15.647 --> 01:02:17.557
OK.

01:02:19.401 --> 01:02:21.109
OK.

01:02:22.279 --> 01:02:25.280
Now, if there is a secret message,

01:02:25.365 --> 01:02:30.698
it'll probably be marked by a symbol
in the upper right-hand corner.

01:02:30.782 --> 01:02:32.359
That's right.

01:02:36.162 --> 01:02:38.570
I am so getting fired for this.

01:03:10.029 --> 01:03:12.816
I told you. You need heat.

01:03:30.842 --> 01:03:32.550
See?

01:03:35.221 --> 01:03:37.344
- We need more juice.
- We need more heat.

01:03:51.863 --> 01:03:54.235
That's not a map.

01:03:54.323 --> 01:03:57.443
- Is it?
- More clues. What a surprise.

01:03:57.535 --> 01:03:59.195
Are those latitudes and longitudes?

01:03:59.287 --> 01:04:01.825
That's why we need
the Silence Dogood letters.

01:04:01.914 --> 01:04:04.999
- That's the key?
- Yeah. "The key in Silence undetected."

01:04:05.084 --> 01:04:06.709
Dad, can we have the letters now?

01:04:06.794 --> 01:04:11.249
Will somebody please explain to me
what these magic numbers are?

01:04:11.334 --> 01:04:13.742
- It's an Ottendorf cipher.
- That's right.

01:04:13.837 --> 01:04:15.664
Oh, OK.

01:04:15.756 --> 01:04:18.673
- What's an Ottendorf cipher?
- They're just codes.

01:04:18.759 --> 01:04:23.088
Each of these three numbers
corresponds to a word in a key.

01:04:23.180 --> 01:04:25.967
Usually a random book
or a newspaper article.

01:04:26.058 --> 01:04:28.180
In this case,
the Silence Dogood letters.

01:04:28.268 --> 01:04:30.676
So it's like the page number
of the key text,

01:04:30.771 --> 01:04:34.056
the line on the page,
and the letter in that line.

01:04:34.149 --> 01:04:36.770
So, Dad, where are the letters?

01:04:36.860 --> 01:04:41.855
You know, it's just by sheer happenstance
that his grandfather...

01:04:41.948 --> 01:04:43.111
- Dad.
...even found them.

01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:45.488
They were in an antique desk
from the press room...

01:04:45.577 --> 01:04:47.237
- Dad.
...of The New England Courant.

01:04:47.329 --> 01:04:50.365
- That's a newspaper.
- Dad, where are the letters?

01:04:50.457 --> 01:04:53.209
I don't have them, son.

01:04:53.293 --> 01:04:56.045
- What?
- I don't have them.

01:05:02.928 --> 01:05:04.303
Where are they?

01:05:04.388 --> 01:05:07.887
I donated them to the Franklin Institute
in Philadelphia.

01:05:08.475 --> 01:05:10.468
Time to go.

01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:16.146
I still can't believe it. All this time
no one knew what was on the back.

01:05:16.233 --> 01:05:17.691
The back of what?

01:05:17.776 --> 01:05:19.899
No!

01:05:19.986 --> 01:05:22.477
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- I know.

01:05:22.572 --> 01:05:25.146
Oh, my God. What have you done?
This is... this is the...

01:05:25.242 --> 01:05:27.993
- I know!
- This is the Declaration of Independence.

01:05:28.078 --> 01:05:31.245
Yes. And it's very delicate.

01:05:31.331 --> 01:05:33.537
You stole it?

01:05:33.625 --> 01:05:38.964
Dad, I can explain, but I don't have time.
It was necessary. And you saw the cipher.

01:05:39.047 --> 01:05:41.752
And that will lead to another clue,
and that will lead to another clue!

01:05:41.842 --> 01:05:45.211
There is no treasure.
I wasted 20 years of my life.

01:05:45.303 --> 01:05:48.139
And now you've destroyed yours.

01:05:48.974 --> 01:05:51.174
And you pulled me into all this.

01:05:51.971 --> 01:05:54.758
Well, we can't have that.

01:05:59.395 --> 01:06:01.968
Come in!

01:06:02.064 --> 01:06:04.057
I'm in here.

01:06:05.025 --> 01:06:07.018
FBI, right?

01:06:10.906 --> 01:06:13.279
You gonna untie me?

01:06:15.953 --> 01:06:18.444
And you have no idea where he's going?

01:06:18.539 --> 01:06:22.584
- Well, wouldn't I have told you if I did?
- Would you?

01:06:22.668 --> 01:06:24.791
He tied me to a chair.

01:06:24.879 --> 01:06:28.923
The garage is empty, but there's a Cadillac
De Ville registered to Patrick Gates.

01:06:29.008 --> 01:06:31.084
And he stole my car.

01:06:31.510 --> 01:06:35.175
Don't worry, Mr Gates, we'll find your car.
And your son.

01:06:37.808 --> 01:06:40.134
Your dad's got a sweet ride.

01:06:40.227 --> 01:06:43.062
I think we should change clothes.

01:06:43.147 --> 01:06:45.685
We look kind of conspicuous,
don't you think?

01:06:45.775 --> 01:06:48.775
I'd love to go shopping, too,
but we have no money.

01:06:48.861 --> 01:06:50.854
Here, I took this from his house.

01:06:50.946 --> 01:06:54.647
He usually tucks a few hundred dollars
somewhere between those pages.

01:06:54.742 --> 01:06:58.905
- Common Sense. How appropriate.
- When are we gonna get there?

01:06:58.996 --> 01:07:02.579
I'm hungry. This car smells weird.

01:07:47.038 --> 01:07:49.197
Excuse me.

01:07:49.290 --> 01:07:52.208
Excuse me. Oops, sorry, sir. Excuse me.

01:07:52.293 --> 01:07:54.286
That's OK.

01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.883
S-S-A-N-D.

01:08:02.971 --> 01:08:04.631
OK.

01:08:06.057 --> 01:08:08.809
You're sure this is right?

01:08:10.186 --> 01:08:11.562
OK.

01:08:11.646 --> 01:08:13.473
S-S-A...

01:08:14.524 --> 01:08:16.314
No, N.

01:08:16.401 --> 01:08:19.651
- That is an N.
- It doesn't look like an N.

01:08:21.573 --> 01:08:24.858
You know what? Here. Last one. OK?

01:08:26.118 --> 01:08:28.408
- One more dollar.
- Thank you.

01:08:28.912 --> 01:08:31.072
Go get the last four letters.

01:08:31.166 --> 01:08:33.573
Go get 'em, chief. Come on.

01:08:51.685 --> 01:08:56.099
OK. "The vision to see the treasured past

01:08:56.191 --> 01:09:02.609
comes as the timely shadow crosses
in front of the house of pass and..."

01:09:02.697 --> 01:09:05.366
"Pass and..." what?

01:09:18.832 --> 01:09:21.502
"Pass and..."

01:09:47.569 --> 01:09:50.060
What's going on?

01:09:52.198 --> 01:09:54.108
- I'm not sure.
- What's up?

01:09:56.620 --> 01:10:00.071
So you show up at your father's door
and say you're in trouble

01:10:00.165 --> 01:10:03.997
and the first thing he assumes
is I'm pregnant.

01:10:04.086 --> 01:10:06.458
Is there a question in there?

01:10:06.547 --> 01:10:09.085
I think there's an interesting story
in there.

01:10:09.174 --> 01:10:13.219
Well, my father thinks I've been
a little too cavalier in my personal life.

01:10:13.303 --> 01:10:16.008
- I see.
- Let me ask you something.

01:10:16.098 --> 01:10:19.015
Have you ever told someone -
not a relative - "I love you"?

01:10:19.101 --> 01:10:21.307
Yes.

01:10:21.395 --> 01:10:24.064
More than one someone?

01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:26.399
Yes.

01:10:26.483 --> 01:10:28.357
Oh. Well, then my father would say

01:10:28.444 --> 01:10:31.813
you've been a little too cavalier
in your personal life, too.

01:10:31.905 --> 01:10:35.357
So you get your sense of absolute certainty
from him, do you?

01:10:35.451 --> 01:10:37.360
Well, I'm sure I don't know
what you mean.

01:10:37.453 --> 01:10:42.198
Well, you're certain the treasure is real,
despite what anyone else thinks.

01:10:42.291 --> 01:10:43.785
No, but I hope it's real.

01:10:43.876 --> 01:10:48.372
I mean, I've dreamt it's real
since my grandfather told me about it.

01:10:48.464 --> 01:10:51.708
But I want to hold it.
I feel like I'm so close, I can taste it.

01:10:51.794 --> 01:10:56.540
But I just... I just want to know it's not just
something in my head or in my heart.

01:11:00.470 --> 01:11:03.387
People don't really talk that way, you know.

01:11:03.473 --> 01:11:07.091
I know. But they think that way.

01:11:13.232 --> 01:11:14.146
Hey.

01:11:14.233 --> 01:11:16.226
- Did you get it? Riley?
- Oh, I got it.

01:11:16.319 --> 01:11:20.019
"The vision to see
the treasured past comes

01:11:20.114 --> 01:11:25.453
as the timely shadow crosses
in front of the house of Pass and Stow."

01:11:25.536 --> 01:11:28.371
Now, "Pass and Stow", of course,
referring to...

01:11:28.456 --> 01:11:31.291
- The Liberty Bell.
- Why do you have to do that?

01:11:31.376 --> 01:11:33.913
Well, John Pass and John Stow
cast the bell.

01:11:34.003 --> 01:11:37.170
OK. Well, then, what does
the rest of this mean?

01:11:37.256 --> 01:11:41.965
Wait..."The vision to see the treasured
past" must refer to a way to read the map.

01:11:42.053 --> 01:11:43.595
Well, I thought the cipher was the map.

01:11:43.679 --> 01:11:46.550
No, the cipher was a way
to find the way to read the map.

01:11:46.641 --> 01:11:48.265
And the way to read the map can be found

01:11:48.351 --> 01:11:52.894
where the "timely shadow" crosses
in front of the Liberty Bell.

01:11:52.980 --> 01:11:56.266
Crosses in front of the "house"
of the Liberty Bell. Independence Hall.

01:11:56.359 --> 01:11:59.810
Right, so "timely shadow" -
it's a specific time.

01:12:00.363 --> 01:12:02.402
- Right.
- What time?

01:12:02.490 --> 01:12:05.277
What time? What time?

01:12:05.993 --> 01:12:09.160
Wait a minute, wait.
You're gonna love this.

01:12:09.247 --> 01:12:12.912
Excuse me, can I see one of those
hundred-dollar bills I paid you with?

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:14.578
No.

01:12:15.044 --> 01:12:18.544
Oh. Well, here,
I have this diver's watch.

01:12:18.631 --> 01:12:21.383
It's called a Submariner. I dive with it.
It's actually quite valuable.

01:12:21.467 --> 01:12:23.543
- You can use it as collateral.
- Whatever.

01:12:23.636 --> 01:12:25.130
Thank you.

01:12:25.221 --> 01:12:27.926
On the back of a hundred-dollar bill
is an etching of Independence Hall

01:12:28.015 --> 01:12:29.639
- based on a painting done in...
- Hello.

01:12:29.723 --> 01:12:32.008
Thank you.
...in the 1780s, who...

01:12:32.097 --> 01:12:35.513
The artist was actually a friend
of Benjamin Franklin's. It's wonderful.

01:12:35.600 --> 01:12:37.225
- Fascinating.
- Hold this.

01:12:37.310 --> 01:12:39.350
OK.

01:12:39.771 --> 01:12:41.930
I'm not going anywhere.

01:12:42.399 --> 01:12:46.017
Now, I think that if we look
at this clock tower...

01:12:47.154 --> 01:12:49.858
...we may find the specific time.

01:12:52.659 --> 01:12:55.826
- What do you see?
- 2:22.

01:12:55.912 --> 01:12:59.281
- What time is it now?
- Almost three.

01:13:00.542 --> 01:13:03.828
- We missed it.
- No, we didn't.

01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:06.756
We didn't miss it because...

01:13:06.840 --> 01:13:11.134
You don't know this? L-I know something
about history that you don't know.

01:13:11.219 --> 01:13:13.259
I'd be very excited to learn about it, Riley.

01:13:13.346 --> 01:13:16.632
Well, hold on one second, let me just...
let me just take in this moment.

01:13:16.725 --> 01:13:19.263
This is... this is cool.

01:13:19.352 --> 01:13:23.136
Is this how you feel all the time? Because,
you know... Except for now, of course.

01:13:23.231 --> 01:13:25.271
- Riley!
- All right.

01:13:25.359 --> 01:13:30.697
What I know is that daylight savings
wasn't established until World War I.

01:13:30.781 --> 01:13:36.404
If it's 3pm now, OK, that means
in 1776, it would be 2pm.

01:13:36.495 --> 01:13:38.452
- Let's go.
- Riley, you're a genius.

01:13:38.538 --> 01:13:40.827
Yeah.

01:13:40.916 --> 01:13:44.498
Do you actually know who the first person
to suggest daylight savings was?

01:13:44.586 --> 01:13:47.373
- Benjamin Franklin.
- Benjamin Franklin.

01:13:47.964 --> 01:13:50.087
Is this real?

01:13:50.175 --> 01:13:52.464
Just tell me what you told my friend.

01:13:52.552 --> 01:13:56.253
Just a bunch of letters.
I can't remember.

01:13:56.348 --> 01:14:00.809
Can you remember which ones
you were gonna tell him next?

01:14:00.894 --> 01:14:03.681
Yeah, here. S-T-O-W.

01:14:11.691 --> 01:14:16.068
Top results: Liberty Bell
and Independence Hall.

01:14:19.407 --> 01:14:22.941
Imagine its impact
back in the 18th century.

01:14:23.035 --> 01:14:27.115
It could have been seen for miles around,
which was exactly its purpose,

01:14:27.206 --> 01:14:32.164
because it served as a beacon, as it were,
for people to collect and hear...

01:14:46.892 --> 01:14:47.841
Good stuff.

01:14:47.935 --> 01:14:52.680
It gained a place in history
on July 8, 1776,

01:14:52.773 --> 01:14:55.181
when the Liberty Bell tolled
for the first public reading

01:14:55.276 --> 01:14:57.897
of the Declaration of Independence.

01:14:57.987 --> 01:15:00.110
Eventually, it was moved from its place

01:15:00.197 --> 01:15:02.653
in Independence Hall steeple
and given its own...

01:15:02.742 --> 01:15:05.363
- Idiot.
- Who?

01:15:05.453 --> 01:15:06.947
- Me.
- What?

01:15:07.038 --> 01:15:10.074
It's not here. It's there.

01:15:10.958 --> 01:15:12.951
Come on.

01:15:21.469 --> 01:15:23.794
- What bell is this?
- It's the Centennial Bell.

01:15:23.888 --> 01:15:27.339
It replaced the Liberty Bell in 1876.

01:15:35.024 --> 01:15:37.063
There it is.

01:15:37.151 --> 01:15:40.520
All right. I'm gonna go down there,
and you meet me in the signing room.

01:15:40.613 --> 01:15:42.938
- OK? All right.
- OK.

01:15:43.032 --> 01:15:45.404
All right, let's go.

01:15:45.493 --> 01:15:48.826
3:22. My idea.

01:16:56.474 --> 01:16:58.384
Hey. What'd you score?

01:16:58.476 --> 01:16:59.971
I found this.

01:17:00.061 --> 01:17:02.552
Some kind of ocular device.

01:17:02.647 --> 01:17:06.063
"The vision to see the treasured past."
Let me take this.

01:17:06.151 --> 01:17:09.851
Aw, they're like early American
X-ray specs.

01:17:09.946 --> 01:17:14.074
Benjamin Franklin invented
something like these.

01:17:14.159 --> 01:17:16.447
I think he invented these.

01:17:16.536 --> 01:17:18.576
So, what do we do with them?

01:17:19.080 --> 01:17:21.203
We look through it.

01:17:24.085 --> 01:17:26.125
Here, help me.

01:17:27.505 --> 01:17:30.169
- Careful.
- You think?

01:17:36.216 --> 01:17:40.677
- What?
- It's just that the last time this was here

01:17:40.763 --> 01:17:43.088
it was being signed.

01:17:45.726 --> 01:17:49.344
- Ben, there's another tour coming.
- Turn it over.

01:17:49.438 --> 01:17:52.107
- Careful.
- Spectacles.

01:18:04.411 --> 01:18:06.368
What do you see?

01:18:09.208 --> 01:18:11.829
What is it? Is it a treasure map?

01:18:11.919 --> 01:18:16.830
It says, "Heere at the wall",
spelled with two E's.

01:18:16.924 --> 01:18:18.916
Take a look.

01:18:22.930 --> 01:18:24.554
Wow.

01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:29.218
Why can't they just say, "Go to this place,
and here's the treasure, spend it wisely"?

01:18:29.311 --> 01:18:31.767
Oh, no.

01:18:32.481 --> 01:18:34.853
- Oh, no.
- Oh, no.

01:18:35.859 --> 01:18:37.354
How'd they find us?

01:18:37.444 --> 01:18:40.979
Well, lan has nearly unlimited resources.
And he's smart.

01:18:41.073 --> 01:18:43.694
I don't think we can get out of here
without being spotted.

01:18:43.784 --> 01:18:46.701
Well, we don't want them to have
the Declaration, or the glasses.

01:18:46.787 --> 01:18:49.408
But we especially don't want them
to have them both together.

01:18:49.498 --> 01:18:52.452
- So what do we do?
- We separate the lock from the key.

01:18:52.543 --> 01:18:54.582
- We're splitting up.
- Good idea.

01:18:54.670 --> 01:18:55.832
Really?

01:18:55.921 --> 01:18:58.127
I'll take this.

01:18:58.215 --> 01:19:01.880
And those. You keep that. Meet me at the
car and call me if you have any problems.

01:19:01.969 --> 01:19:04.923
Like if we get caught and killed?

01:19:05.014 --> 01:19:08.548
Yeah. That would be a big problem.
Take care of her.

01:19:08.642 --> 01:19:10.925
- I will.
- I will.

01:19:19.564 --> 01:19:21.272
We're on him.

01:19:23.776 --> 01:19:25.603
There he is.

01:19:29.657 --> 01:19:32.065
- Let's walk this way.
- Wait up.

01:19:32.827 --> 01:19:36.243
- Shaw, look. There's the others.
- I got it.

01:19:37.665 --> 01:19:42.742
Viktor, meet me at Fifth and Chestnut. Fifth
and Chestnut. They're heading your way.

01:20:07.904 --> 01:20:09.481
- Look out! Look out!
- Riley!

01:20:09.572 --> 01:20:12.490
- There they are! Move!
- Move!

01:20:13.368 --> 01:20:16.072
- Time to run.
- Keep up, Viktor! Move. Come on.

01:20:22.960 --> 01:20:25.333
In here.

01:20:30.301 --> 01:20:32.508
- Come on.
- Follow me.

01:20:37.809 --> 01:20:39.801
That way.

01:20:46.651 --> 01:20:49.895
If you're not a steak,
you don't belong here.

01:20:50.399 --> 01:20:53.649
I'm just trying to hide
from my ex-husband.

01:20:53.735 --> 01:20:56.522
- Who, baldy?
- Yes.

01:20:57.197 --> 01:20:59.320
Honey, stay as long as you like.

01:20:59.408 --> 01:21:01.696
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

01:21:01.785 --> 01:21:03.778
You want something?

01:21:09.835 --> 01:21:12.504
- Do you want something?
- Shut up.

01:21:15.257 --> 01:21:17.333
I see why you left him.

01:21:22.889 --> 01:21:24.882
Go around. Go around.

01:21:30.564 --> 01:21:32.307
Gates!

01:21:58.258 --> 01:22:00.583
Aw, come on!

01:22:10.103 --> 01:22:12.559
- Where were you?
- Hiding.

01:22:12.647 --> 01:22:14.889
Come on. Let's go, let's go.

01:22:20.030 --> 01:22:23.031
Lan. Lan, I've got 'em.
They're heading toward City Hall.

01:22:23.116 --> 01:22:26.201
- OK, I'm on my way.
- Out of the way!

01:22:55.267 --> 01:22:56.975
They're headed for the breezeway
on the north side.

01:22:57.061 --> 01:22:57.974
I'll be right there.

01:23:07.446 --> 01:23:09.439
Hey, Gates!

01:23:15.287 --> 01:23:18.703
Enough, man! Give me the document.

01:23:19.792 --> 01:23:21.998
All right, Phil.

01:23:38.853 --> 01:23:41.854
Watch out! Get out of my way!

01:23:45.526 --> 01:23:47.353
Watch it!

01:24:29.522 --> 01:24:31.729
Leave them! Let 'em go.

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:36.314
We've got it.

01:24:37.155 --> 01:24:40.987
- FBI. Have you seen this guy?
- No.

01:24:41.826 --> 01:24:43.618
Nope, I haven't seen him.

01:24:43.703 --> 01:24:46.657
Ted. Philadelphia police
found Gates's car.

01:24:46.748 --> 01:24:49.120
It's close.
We got surveillance there now.

01:24:49.209 --> 01:24:51.960
Let's go. Tell the boss
we got the car.

01:24:54.464 --> 01:24:56.042
- What?
- We lost it.

01:24:56.132 --> 01:24:59.751
- What?
- We lost the Declaration. Lan took it.

01:25:01.971 --> 01:25:05.091
Yeah, OK. You all right?
You both all right?

01:25:05.183 --> 01:25:07.259
Yeah, yeah, we're all right.

01:25:07.352 --> 01:25:10.555
- Ben, I'm sorry.
- We'll be fine.

01:25:10.647 --> 01:25:13.185
Meet me at the car.

01:25:19.072 --> 01:25:20.815
Suspect has arrived.

01:25:24.327 --> 01:25:26.284
Hello, Mr Gates.

01:25:27.539 --> 01:25:30.742
Mr Gates, face your father's car and
put your hands behind your back, please.

01:25:30.834 --> 01:25:34.416
- We got one in custody.
- Gates, you're a hard man to find.

01:25:34.504 --> 01:25:36.082
Could you please be careful?

01:25:50.347 --> 01:25:53.882
Riley, do you know
how to get in touch with lan?

01:25:55.936 --> 01:25:57.763
Excuse me?

01:26:02.234 --> 01:26:03.397
That's some story.

01:26:03.485 --> 01:26:07.150
Well, it's the same story I tried to tell you
guys before the Declaration was stolen.

01:26:07.239 --> 01:26:11.071
- By you.
- No, by lan. I stole it to stop him.

01:26:11.160 --> 01:26:14.410
I did it alone.
Dr Chase was not involved.

01:26:14.997 --> 01:26:18.330
And lan still ended up with
the Declaration of Independence.

01:26:18.417 --> 01:26:20.456
Because of you.

01:26:21.086 --> 01:26:24.004
So here's your options.

01:26:24.089 --> 01:26:28.169
Door number one,
you go to prison for a very long time.

01:26:28.677 --> 01:26:33.719
Door number two, we are going to get back
the Declaration of Independence,

01:26:33.807 --> 01:26:38.600
you help us find it, and you still
go to prison for a very long time,

01:26:38.687 --> 01:26:41.095
but you feel better inside.

01:26:41.190 --> 01:26:44.606
Is there a door that doesn't lead to prison?

01:26:45.402 --> 01:26:48.522
- Someone's got to go to prison, Ben.
- Yeah.

01:26:51.033 --> 01:26:53.322
So what are these for?

01:26:53.410 --> 01:26:55.403
It's a way to read the map.

01:26:55.496 --> 01:26:57.204
Right.

01:26:57.289 --> 01:26:58.783
Knights Templar.

01:26:58.874 --> 01:27:00.333
Freemasons.

01:27:00.417 --> 01:27:02.908
Invisible treasure map.

01:27:03.545 --> 01:27:07.294
- So what'd it say?
- "Heere at the wall."

01:27:07.383 --> 01:27:09.874
Nothing else.

01:27:09.968 --> 01:27:12.460
It's just another clue.

01:27:12.554 --> 01:27:15.128
It looks like lan Howe
could be a false identity.

01:27:15.224 --> 01:27:17.893
Follow up with ATF and INS.

01:27:18.435 --> 01:27:20.891
There's more to it.

01:27:20.980 --> 01:27:23.471
- Standard tap procedure.
- Let's check the signal, folks.

01:27:23.565 --> 01:27:25.891
- Lock it in.
- Are we set?

01:27:25.985 --> 01:27:29.104
- Checking source.
- Unknown number.

01:27:32.235 --> 01:27:33.480
Yes.

01:27:33.569 --> 01:27:36.239
Hello, Ben. How are you?

01:27:36.322 --> 01:27:39.738
- Um, chained to a desk.
- Sorry to hear that.

01:27:40.284 --> 01:27:42.906
I want you to meet me on the flight deck
of the USS Intrepid.

01:27:42.996 --> 01:27:45.072
- You know where that is?
- New York.

01:27:45.540 --> 01:27:47.532
Meet me there at ten o'clock
tomorrow morning.

01:27:47.625 --> 01:27:51.124
And bring those glasses
you found at Independence Hall.

01:27:51.212 --> 01:27:53.584
Yeah, I know about the glasses.

01:27:54.549 --> 01:27:58.463
We can take a look at the Declaration,
and then you can be on your way.

01:27:58.553 --> 01:28:00.344
And I'm supposed to believe that.

01:28:00.430 --> 01:28:03.134
I told you from the start,
I only wanted to borrow it.

01:28:03.641 --> 01:28:05.550
You can have it. And the glasses.

01:28:05.643 --> 01:28:09.427
I'll even throw in the pipe
from the Charlotte.

01:28:09.522 --> 01:28:11.230
I'll be there.

01:28:11.316 --> 01:28:14.352
And tell the FBI agents
listening in on this call

01:28:14.444 --> 01:28:18.358
if they want the Declaration back,
and not just a box of confetti,

01:28:18.448 --> 01:28:20.820
then you'll come alone.

01:28:33.838 --> 01:28:36.625
- Take positions.
- Perimeter looks normal.

01:28:36.716 --> 01:28:40.085
- Can I get a status report?
- Crow's nest in position. Port side is quiet.

01:28:40.178 --> 01:28:41.672
Copy that.

01:28:51.773 --> 01:28:55.391
- Gates is on the flight deck.
- Eyes on Gates.

01:28:55.485 --> 01:28:58.688
- Do not lose sight of primary mark.
- Brian, you're clear with NYPD.

01:28:58.780 --> 01:29:01.318
- I have a visual.
- Gates.

01:29:01.407 --> 01:29:02.605
Stay with the program.

01:29:02.700 --> 01:29:05.986
I hope your agents are all under four feet
tall and wearing little scarves.

01:29:06.079 --> 01:29:07.988
Otherwise lan's gonna know they're here.

01:29:08.081 --> 01:29:10.910
As soon as he shows you the Declaration,
we'll move in.

01:29:10.994 --> 01:29:13.568
Don't try anything.
Just let us handle it.

01:29:13.664 --> 01:29:17.827
You know, Agent Sadusky,
something I've noticed about fishing:

01:29:17.918 --> 01:29:20.705
It never works out so well for the bait.

01:29:27.260 --> 01:29:32.136
Sir, we've got some traffic incoming.
Looks like a sightseeing helicopter.

01:29:32.224 --> 01:29:34.596
Unit two,
get an eyeball on that chopper.

01:29:34.685 --> 01:29:38.136
Agent Michaels, get FAA flight plans
and authorization records on that craft.

01:29:38.230 --> 01:29:41.563
If that's not Mr Howe,
I want to know who it is.

01:29:41.650 --> 01:29:45.861
- I got him. He's coming from the north.
- Gates. Are you with me?

01:29:45.946 --> 01:29:49.778
Well, I'm sure not against you,
if that's what you're asking.

01:30:12.973 --> 01:30:15.380
We've got some interference
on Gates's mike, sir.

01:30:15.475 --> 01:30:16.673
This I know.

01:30:18.145 --> 01:30:20.683
Hello, Ben.

01:30:20.772 --> 01:30:24.224
Thomas Edison needed only one way
to make a light bulb.

01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:26.690
Sound familiar?

01:30:28.739 --> 01:30:30.945
- Keep sightlines clear.
- What's the devil's going on?

01:30:31.033 --> 01:30:32.693
There's a lot of commotion.
We can't see Gates.

01:30:32.784 --> 01:30:37.577
Go to the starboard observation point
behind the F-16 and here's what you do.

01:30:39.124 --> 01:30:40.499
Gates? Gates?

01:30:40.584 --> 01:30:44.202
Air Tour helicopter,
you are in controlled airspace.

01:30:44.296 --> 01:30:45.873
Vacate immediately.

01:30:45.964 --> 01:30:47.542
Who's got Gates?

01:30:47.633 --> 01:30:49.952
- All agents, report in.
- I can't see anything.

01:30:50.046 --> 01:30:53.379
- Did Gates speak to anybody?
- Target is moving.

01:30:53.466 --> 01:30:57.415
- He's heading towards the stern.
- I've got him. He's coming this way.

01:30:57.511 --> 01:30:59.634
Anyone got a view of our friend lan Howe?

01:30:59.722 --> 01:31:01.596
Lan Howe is not at the stern, sir.

01:31:01.682 --> 01:31:04.885
Then why is he heading there?

01:31:04.977 --> 01:31:08.144
He's at the observation deck.

01:31:08.230 --> 01:31:09.310
Sadusky.

01:31:09.732 --> 01:31:11.641
I'm still not against you.

01:31:11.734 --> 01:31:15.566
But I found door number three.
And I'm taking it.

01:31:15.655 --> 01:31:17.694
- What's he talking about?
- Move in!

01:31:17.782 --> 01:31:20.023
Move in! Move in on Gates!

01:31:30.044 --> 01:31:31.040
Divers are a go.

01:31:31.128 --> 01:31:33.833
- Snipers, go to action zebra.
- All teams, move in. Pursue at own risk.

01:31:33.923 --> 01:31:36.675
- I repeat, pursue at own risk.
- You first.

01:31:36.759 --> 01:31:39.332
Holy mackerel. He set us up.

01:32:01.701 --> 01:32:05.449
Agent Dawes, do you have a visual?
Can you see Gates in the water?

01:32:05.538 --> 01:32:08.243
Sir, it's the Hudson. Nothing is visible.

01:32:09.083 --> 01:32:11.076
Smart fish.

01:32:29.520 --> 01:32:33.049
Hello, Ben. Welcome to New Jersey.

01:32:34.060 --> 01:32:36.598
- What'd you do with Abigail and Riley?
- Hope these fit.

01:32:36.688 --> 01:32:38.230
We had to guess your sizes.

01:32:38.315 --> 01:32:40.307
I said, what'd you do
with Abigail and Riley?

01:32:40.400 --> 01:32:42.642
He's the only one who could've
told you that line about Edison.

01:32:42.736 --> 01:32:44.693
Did you bring the glasses?

01:32:44.779 --> 01:32:46.606
I don't know.
Tell me what's happening here.

01:32:46.698 --> 01:32:49.271
Ask your girlfriend.

01:32:49.367 --> 01:32:51.823
She's the one calling all the shots now.

01:32:51.911 --> 01:32:54.663
She won't shut up.

01:32:57.959 --> 01:33:00.415
Yeah, hello.

01:33:00.503 --> 01:33:02.792
It's for you.

01:33:03.256 --> 01:33:07.170
- Hello.
- Hi, sweetie. How's your day going?

01:33:07.260 --> 01:33:09.336
Uh, interesting, dear.

01:33:09.429 --> 01:33:11.885
So, what, you working with lan now?

01:33:12.515 --> 01:33:16.465
It turns out helping someone escape
from FBI custody is a criminal act.

01:33:16.561 --> 01:33:18.055
And he's the only criminal we knew.

01:33:18.146 --> 01:33:21.100
- So we called him and made a deal.
- Well, you're...

01:33:22.609 --> 01:33:25.278
You're... you're... you're all right, yeah?
I mean you're safe?

01:33:25.362 --> 01:33:27.650
Yeah, we both are.

01:33:27.739 --> 01:33:31.155
Riley's right here, doing
something clever with a computer.

01:33:31.242 --> 01:33:33.318
I'm tracking him through the... Hey!

01:33:33.411 --> 01:33:35.819
I'm tracking you through the GPS
in Shaw's phone.

01:33:35.914 --> 01:33:39.164
They take a turn anywhere we don't want,
we'll know it. So don't worry.

01:33:39.250 --> 01:33:44.755
If lan tries to double-cross us, we can call
the FBI and tell them right where you are.

01:33:44.839 --> 01:33:47.627
- And where to find lan.
- And where is that?

01:33:47.717 --> 01:33:49.924
Right across the street
from where we're hiding,

01:33:50.011 --> 01:33:51.968
at the intersection
of Wall Street and Broadway.

01:33:52.555 --> 01:33:54.928
Well, you figured out the clue.

01:33:55.016 --> 01:33:58.266
Simple. "Heere at the wall."
Wall Street and Broadway.

01:34:01.523 --> 01:34:03.599
Ben, there is a catch.

01:34:03.692 --> 01:34:06.728
We made lan believe
he could have the treasure.

01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:08.777
It was the only way
we could get this far.

01:34:08.863 --> 01:34:11.099
He's here.

01:34:18.492 --> 01:34:20.485
Here we go.

01:34:25.207 --> 01:34:26.238
Ben.

01:34:26.333 --> 01:34:31.458
You all right? No broken bones?
A jump like that could kill a man.

01:34:31.547 --> 01:34:34.298
Naw, it was cool.
You should try it sometime.

01:34:36.802 --> 01:34:40.586
The Declaration of Independence.
And the meerschaum pipe.

01:34:41.181 --> 01:34:43.174
All yours.

01:34:44.059 --> 01:34:47.475
- That's it?
- That's it.

01:34:47.563 --> 01:34:51.774
I knew you'd keep your promise.
Now, where is it? Where's my treasure?

01:34:51.859 --> 01:34:53.602
It's right here.

01:34:53.694 --> 01:34:56.944
The map said "Heere at the wall",
spelled with two E's.

01:34:57.031 --> 01:34:59.735
Wall Street follows the path
of an actual wall

01:34:59.825 --> 01:35:02.909
that the original Dutch settlers built
as a defence to keep the British out.

01:35:02.995 --> 01:35:07.538
The main gate was located at a street
called De Heere, also two E's.

01:35:07.625 --> 01:35:10.294
Later De Heere Street was renamed
Broadway after the British got in.

01:35:10.377 --> 01:35:12.915
So, "Heere at the wall."

01:35:13.005 --> 01:35:16.421
Broadway, Wall Street.

01:35:16.508 --> 01:35:18.335
Cheerio.

01:35:19.762 --> 01:35:21.422
Just a moment, Ben.

01:35:21.513 --> 01:35:26.306
Lan, if you break our deal, the FBI
will be only a few minutes behind you.

01:35:26.393 --> 01:35:29.311
You might get away, you might not.

01:35:32.816 --> 01:35:35.023
Is that all the map said?

01:35:37.029 --> 01:35:39.187
Every word.

01:35:41.158 --> 01:35:43.483
Oh, Ben.

01:35:43.577 --> 01:35:46.827
You know the key
to running a convincing bluff?

01:35:46.914 --> 01:35:50.858
Every once in a while
you've got to be holding all the cards.

01:36:01.673 --> 01:36:03.250
Dad.

01:36:05.760 --> 01:36:08.595
Is there anything else you want to tell me?

01:36:12.684 --> 01:36:16.053
Trinity Church. We have to go
inside Trinity Church.

01:36:19.482 --> 01:36:21.771
Good. Excellent.

01:36:21.859 --> 01:36:24.860
Well, why don't you ask Dr Chase
and Riley to join us?

01:36:24.946 --> 01:36:28.113
I'm sure they're around here somewhere.

01:36:33.329 --> 01:36:35.820
Are you all right?

01:36:35.915 --> 01:36:38.453
What do you think? I'm a hostage.

01:36:39.919 --> 01:36:42.208
Sit. Sit down.

01:36:42.297 --> 01:36:45.416
- Let him go, lan.
- When we find the treasure.

01:36:45.508 --> 01:36:49.837
No, now. Or you can figure out
the clues for yourself.

01:36:49.929 --> 01:36:51.756
Good luck.

01:36:51.848 --> 01:36:53.259
Ben.

01:36:53.349 --> 01:36:57.217
I don't think you fully appreciate
the gravity of the situation.

01:37:05.695 --> 01:37:08.103
Let's have a look at that map.

01:37:44.269 --> 01:37:45.763
It's...

01:37:47.814 --> 01:37:50.484
It's... it's really quite something. It's...

01:37:50.567 --> 01:37:52.939
It really is remarkable. Take a look.

01:37:59.493 --> 01:38:03.537
- "Parkington Lane."
- "Beneath Parkington Lane."

01:38:03.622 --> 01:38:07.620
But why would the map lead us here,
then take us somewhere else?

01:38:07.709 --> 01:38:10.200
- What's the purpose?
- Just another clue.

01:38:10.295 --> 01:38:15.004
Dad. No, you're right. Parkington Lane
has to be here somewhere.

01:38:16.134 --> 01:38:18.756
A street inside the church?

01:38:18.845 --> 01:38:21.419
Not inside. Beneath.

01:38:21.515 --> 01:38:23.554
Beneath the church.

01:38:28.021 --> 01:38:30.512
- I'm so sorry, Ben.
- None of this is your fault.

01:38:30.607 --> 01:38:31.722
- I co...
- Come on.

01:38:41.451 --> 01:38:42.862
Look.

01:38:44.288 --> 01:38:48.237
Cooperation only lasts as long
as the status quo is unchanged.

01:38:48.333 --> 01:38:53.244
As soon as this guy gets to wherever this
thing ends, he won't need you any more.

01:38:53.338 --> 01:38:54.619
Or... or any of us.

01:38:54.715 --> 01:38:58.499
So we find a way to make sure
the status quo changes in our favour.

01:38:58.593 --> 01:39:02.508
- How?
- I'm still working on it.

01:39:02.598 --> 01:39:05.717
Well, I guess I better
work on it too, then.

01:39:05.809 --> 01:39:08.514
Hey! Par... Hey, I found it!

01:39:08.604 --> 01:39:10.389
- Him!
- Ben!

01:39:10.933 --> 01:39:12.926
It's a name.

01:39:15.813 --> 01:39:17.556
Parkington Lane.

01:39:17.648 --> 01:39:21.313
He was a third-degree master mason
of the Blue Lo...

01:39:21.402 --> 01:39:23.691
Hey! Stop!

01:39:38.002 --> 01:39:39.544
Easy.

01:39:43.132 --> 01:39:45.125
Careful no one steps in him.

01:39:45.217 --> 01:39:47.376
All right, put it down.

01:39:54.268 --> 01:39:59.429
OK. Who wants to go down
the creepy tunnel inside the tomb first?

01:40:00.399 --> 01:40:04.812
Right. McGregor, Viktor, you stay here.

01:40:05.363 --> 01:40:10.653
And if anyone should come out without me,
well... use your imagination.

01:40:13.579 --> 01:40:15.572
Shall we?

01:40:33.307 --> 01:40:36.142
You got a light?

01:40:52.737 --> 01:40:55.109
Careful.

01:40:55.198 --> 01:40:57.440
Watch your step.

01:41:03.248 --> 01:41:05.240
Come here.

01:41:14.593 --> 01:41:16.965
Why does that never happen to me?

01:41:23.018 --> 01:41:25.010
What's this?

01:41:40.493 --> 01:41:42.533
It's a chandelier.

01:41:51.713 --> 01:41:53.041
Here.

01:42:08.980 --> 01:42:11.815
- Wow.
- Look at the elevators.

01:42:11.900 --> 01:42:13.477
A dumbwaiter system.

01:42:13.568 --> 01:42:16.190
How do a bunch of guys with hand tools
build all this?

01:42:16.279 --> 01:42:19.862
Same way they built the pyramids
and the Great Wall of China.

01:42:19.950 --> 01:42:23.069
Yeah. The aliens helped them.

01:42:23.161 --> 01:42:25.367
Right, let's go. What are we waiting for?

01:42:25.789 --> 01:42:29.946
I'm not going out on that thing.
200 years of termite damage and rot.

01:42:30.037 --> 01:42:33.038
Dad, do what he says.

01:42:52.351 --> 01:42:54.557
Watch your step.

01:42:56.438 --> 01:42:58.348
We're right under the Trinity graveyard.

01:42:58.440 --> 01:43:01.062
That's probably why
no one ever found this.

01:43:05.781 --> 01:43:07.774
What is that?

01:43:12.162 --> 01:43:14.155
Subway.

01:43:20.170 --> 01:43:22.412
Shaw! Oh, God, Shaw!

01:43:33.100 --> 01:43:35.009
Oh, my God.

01:43:39.565 --> 01:43:42.186
Hold on! Hold on!

01:43:44.653 --> 01:43:46.978
OK, get on the elevator. Jump!

01:43:50.159 --> 01:43:52.365
Ben! Grab my hand.

01:43:54.371 --> 01:43:55.996
- Come on.
- Lan!

01:43:56.081 --> 01:43:58.833
Abigail! Get on!

01:44:02.588 --> 01:44:04.545
Jump!

01:44:14.010 --> 01:44:15.125
Here.

01:44:23.353 --> 01:44:25.013
Ben!

01:44:25.772 --> 01:44:28.393
Get down there.
Get down there!

01:44:33.821 --> 01:44:35.481
The Declaration.

01:44:38.701 --> 01:44:40.908
- Do you trust me?
- Yes.

01:44:55.051 --> 01:44:56.878
Oh, no! Ben!

01:45:03.101 --> 01:45:05.058
Hang on!

01:45:13.778 --> 01:45:15.272
Son!

01:45:22.328 --> 01:45:26.373
I'm sorry. I'm sorry I dropped you.
I had to save the Declaration.

01:45:26.457 --> 01:45:31.000
No, don't be. I would have done
exactly the same thing to you.

01:45:31.087 --> 01:45:33.210
Really?

01:45:33.298 --> 01:45:36.916
I would have dropped you both.
Freaks.

01:45:44.434 --> 01:45:46.640
Get on.

01:45:46.728 --> 01:45:48.519
Lan...

01:45:48.605 --> 01:45:51.006
it's not worth it.

01:45:51.101 --> 01:45:55.763
Do you imagine any one of your lives
is more valuable to me than Shaw's?

01:45:55.856 --> 01:45:57.136
We go on.

01:45:58.942 --> 01:46:02.892
The status quo.
Keep the status quo.

01:46:10.621 --> 01:46:13.871
- Now what?
- This is...

01:46:13.957 --> 01:46:16.828
This is where it all leads.

01:46:26.303 --> 01:46:28.296
OK, let's go.

01:47:11.223 --> 01:47:13.761
What is this?

01:47:13.850 --> 01:47:16.258
So where's the treasure?

01:47:19.189 --> 01:47:20.518
Well?

01:47:22.150 --> 01:47:24.439
This is it?

01:47:24.528 --> 01:47:26.935
We came all this way
for a dead end?

01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:29.648
Yes.

01:47:32.863 --> 01:47:35.699
- There's gotta be something more.
- Riley, there's nothing more.

01:47:35.783 --> 01:47:38.155
- Another clue, or...
- No, there are no more clues!

01:47:38.244 --> 01:47:39.868
That's it, OK? It's over!

01:47:39.954 --> 01:47:44.082
End of the road. The treasure's gone.
Moved. Taken somewhere else.

01:47:45.418 --> 01:47:49.367
You're not playing games with me,
are you, Ben? Hm?

01:47:49.463 --> 01:47:52.417
You know where it is.

01:47:52.508 --> 01:47:54.252
No.

01:47:57.972 --> 01:48:00.214
OK, go.

01:48:00.308 --> 01:48:03.095
Hey, wait a minute.

01:48:03.477 --> 01:48:05.719
- Hey! Lan, wait!
- Wait, wait, wait!

01:48:05.813 --> 01:48:07.521
- Lan...
- We'll be trapped.

01:48:07.607 --> 01:48:10.062
- Don't do this.
- You can't just leave us here.

01:48:10.151 --> 01:48:14.065
Yes, I can.
Unless Ben tells me the next clue.

01:48:14.155 --> 01:48:16.397
There isn't another clue.

01:48:16.490 --> 01:48:20.903
Lan, why don't you come back down here
and we can talk through this together?

01:48:20.995 --> 01:48:23.533
- Don't speak again.
- OK.

01:48:24.957 --> 01:48:29.085
The clue. Where's the treasure?

01:48:30.171 --> 01:48:31.285
Ben?

01:48:34.383 --> 01:48:36.376
- The lantern.
- Dad...

01:48:37.845 --> 01:48:40.134
The status quo has changed, son.

01:48:40.222 --> 01:48:41.847
Don't.

01:48:44.852 --> 01:48:48.684
It's part of freemason teachings.

01:48:48.773 --> 01:48:52.189
In King Solomon's temple
there was a winding staircase.

01:48:52.276 --> 01:48:58.231
It signified the journey that had to be made
to find the light of truth.

01:48:58.324 --> 01:49:02.156
- The lantern is the clue.
- And what does it mean?

01:49:02.245 --> 01:49:04.736
Boston. It's Boston.

01:49:04.830 --> 01:49:06.490
The Old North Church in Boston,

01:49:06.582 --> 01:49:10.111
where Thomas Newton
hung a lantern in the steeple,

01:49:10.205 --> 01:49:14.119
to signal Paul Revere that the British
were coming. One if by land, two if by sea.

01:49:14.209 --> 01:49:19.369
One lantern. Under the winding staircase
of the steeple, that's where we have to look.

01:49:19.464 --> 01:49:22.833
- Thank you.
- Hey, you have to take us with you.

01:49:22.926 --> 01:49:26.093
Why? So you can escape in Boston?

01:49:26.179 --> 01:49:29.797
Besides, with you out of the picture
there's less baggage to carry.

01:49:29.891 --> 01:49:32.098
What if we lied?

01:49:32.185 --> 01:49:33.430
Did you?

01:49:33.520 --> 01:49:36.272
What if there's another clue?

01:49:36.356 --> 01:49:38.562
Then I'll know right where to find you.

01:49:40.193 --> 01:49:42.186
See you, Ben.

01:49:44.739 --> 01:49:46.483
- No!
- There's no other way out!

01:49:46.575 --> 01:49:48.614
- Come back!
- You're gonna need us, lan!

01:49:49.619 --> 01:49:51.991
We're all gonna die.

01:49:52.080 --> 01:49:56.125
It's gonna be OK, Riley.
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

01:49:56.209 --> 01:49:58.285
It's OK, kiddo.

01:49:58.378 --> 01:50:04.048
OK, boys, what's going on? The British
came by sea. It was two lanterns, not one.

01:50:04.134 --> 01:50:07.254
Lan needed another clue,
so we gave it to him.

01:50:07.345 --> 01:50:10.263
It was a fake.
It was a fake clue.

01:50:10.348 --> 01:50:12.886
The all-seeing eye.

01:50:12.976 --> 01:50:15.467
"Through the all-seeing eye."

01:50:16.229 --> 01:50:19.230
That means... by the time lan
figures it out and comes back here,

01:50:19.316 --> 01:50:23.016
we'll still be trapped,
and he'll shoot us then.

01:50:23.570 --> 01:50:26.239
Either way, we're gonna die.

01:50:27.032 --> 01:50:30.365
Nobody's gonna die.
There's another way out.

01:50:30.911 --> 01:50:31.990
Where?

01:50:32.078 --> 01:50:34.652
Through the treasure room.

01:50:41.463 --> 01:50:43.455
Here.

01:50:53.219 --> 01:50:54.962
Riley.

01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:25.032
Looks like someone got here first.

01:51:26.252 --> 01:51:28.825
I'm sorry, Ben.

01:51:28.921 --> 01:51:30.748
It's gone.

01:51:33.217 --> 01:51:35.922
- Listen, Ben...
- It may have even been gone

01:51:36.011 --> 01:51:39.879
before Charles Carroll
told the story to Thomas Gates.

01:51:41.100 --> 01:51:43.223
It doesn't matter.

01:51:43.310 --> 01:51:46.264
I know. Cos you were right.

01:51:46.355 --> 01:51:49.226
No, I wasn't right.

01:51:49.316 --> 01:51:51.986
This room is real, Ben.

01:51:52.069 --> 01:51:54.394
And that means the treasure is real.

01:51:54.905 --> 01:51:57.692
We're in the company of
some of the most brilliant minds in history,

01:51:57.783 --> 01:52:01.615
because you found
what they left behind for us to find

01:52:01.704 --> 01:52:04.277
and understood the meaning of it.

01:52:04.373 --> 01:52:07.290
You did it, Ben. For all of us.

01:52:08.294 --> 01:52:11.627
Your grandfather, and all of us.

01:52:12.089 --> 01:52:16.087
And I've never been so happy
to be proven wrong.

01:52:26.478 --> 01:52:28.601
I just...

01:52:28.689 --> 01:52:31.767
really thought
I was gonna find the treasure.

01:52:33.730 --> 01:52:35.639
OK.

01:52:35.732 --> 01:52:38.483
Then we just keep looking for it.

01:52:41.779 --> 01:52:43.772
I'm in.

01:52:48.494 --> 01:52:50.286
OK.

01:52:51.915 --> 01:52:55.034
Not to be Johnny Rain Cloud here,
but that's not gonna happen.

01:52:55.126 --> 01:52:58.460
Because as far as I can see,
we're still trapped down here.

01:52:58.546 --> 01:53:00.254
Yeah.

01:53:01.132 --> 01:53:03.006
Now, Ben,
where is this other way out?

01:53:03.092 --> 01:53:05.168
Well, that's it.
It doesn't make any sense,

01:53:05.261 --> 01:53:08.464
because the first thing the builders
would have done after getting down here

01:53:08.556 --> 01:53:11.593
was cut a secondary shaft back out for air...

01:53:11.684 --> 01:53:14.804
- Right.
...and in case of cave-ins.

01:53:37.043 --> 01:53:40.163
Could it really be that simple?

01:53:44.634 --> 01:53:46.792
"The secret lies with Charlotte."

01:55:14.760 --> 01:55:17.761
Scrolls from the library at Alexandria.

01:55:19.890 --> 01:55:21.764
Could this be possible?

01:55:41.286 --> 01:55:46.328
It's a big... bluish-green man,

01:55:46.416 --> 01:55:49.287
with a strange-looking goatee.

01:55:49.378 --> 01:55:52.159
I'm guessing that's significant.

01:56:41.549 --> 01:56:42.545
Yes!

01:56:54.312 --> 01:56:57.063
Riley, are you crying?

01:56:57.148 --> 01:56:59.187
Look.

01:56:59.275 --> 01:57:01.433
Stairs.

01:57:17.752 --> 01:57:19.791
Hi.

01:57:19.879 --> 01:57:22.121
Do you have a cell phone I could borrow?

01:57:35.013 --> 01:57:38.014
- Just like that?
- Just like that.

01:57:38.099 --> 01:57:41.385
You do know you just handed me
your biggest bargaining chip?

01:57:41.478 --> 01:57:44.763
The Declaration of Independence
is not a bargaining chip.

01:57:44.856 --> 01:57:46.564
Not to me.

01:57:46.650 --> 01:57:48.393
Have a seat.

01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:51.232
So what's your offer?

01:57:51.821 --> 01:57:54.739
How about a bribe? Say...

01:57:55.742 --> 01:57:59.028
ten billion dollars?

01:57:59.120 --> 01:58:00.745
I take it you found the treasure?

01:58:00.830 --> 01:58:03.452
It's about five stories
beneath your shoes.

01:58:07.254 --> 01:58:09.377
You know, the Templars
and the Freemasons believed

01:58:09.464 --> 01:58:14.173
that the treasure was too great
for any one man to have, not even a king.

01:58:14.261 --> 01:58:18.009
That's why they went to such lengths
to keep it hidden.

01:58:18.098 --> 01:58:20.470
That's right.

01:58:20.559 --> 01:58:24.093
The Founding Fathers believed
the same thing about government.

01:58:24.187 --> 01:58:27.473
I figure their solution
will work for the treasure too.

01:58:27.941 --> 01:58:29.020
Give it to the people.

01:58:29.109 --> 01:58:34.186
Divide it amongst the Smithsonian,
the Louvre, the Cairo museum...

01:58:34.281 --> 01:58:37.400
There's thousands of years
of world history down there.

01:58:37.492 --> 01:58:41.905
And it belongs to the world,
and everybody in it.

01:58:41.997 --> 01:58:45.697
You really don't understand
the concept of a bargaining chip.

01:58:46.334 --> 01:58:50.961
OK, here's what I want.
Dr Chase gets off completely clean,

01:58:51.047 --> 01:58:53.170
not even a little Post-it
on her service record.

01:58:53.258 --> 01:58:54.123
OK.

01:58:54.217 --> 01:59:00.386
I want the credit for the find
to go to the entire Gates family,

01:59:00.473 --> 01:59:03.261
with the assistance of Mr Riley Poole.

01:59:03.351 --> 01:59:05.677
And what about you?

01:59:05.770 --> 01:59:07.810
I'd really love not to go to prison.

01:59:07.898 --> 01:59:12.850
I can't even begin to describe
how much I would love not to go to prison.

01:59:14.064 --> 01:59:17.149
Someone's got to go to prison, Ben.

01:59:17.234 --> 01:59:22.442
Well, if you've got a helicopter,
I think I can help with that.

01:59:30.873 --> 01:59:33.198
Freeze! FBI!

01:59:35.336 --> 01:59:37.542
- Freeze! Don't move!
- Show me your hands!

01:59:39.381 --> 01:59:42.881
- Put your hands up.
- Move, move, move.

01:59:46.513 --> 01:59:48.387
You're under arrest, Mr Howe.

01:59:48.474 --> 01:59:51.843
We've got you on kidnapping,
attempted murder...

01:59:51.936 --> 01:59:54.937
and trespassing on government property.

02:00:03.280 --> 02:00:06.067
Yeah. You got it, chief.
Thank you. Bye.

02:00:07.243 --> 02:00:10.243
They want us in Cairo next week
for the opening of the exhibit.

02:00:10.329 --> 02:00:12.203
They're sending a private jet.

02:00:12.289 --> 02:00:13.487
That's fun.

02:00:13.582 --> 02:00:17.414
Yeah, big whoop. We could have had
a whole fleet of private jets.

02:00:17.503 --> 02:00:20.670
Ten per cent, Ben. They offered you
ten per cent and you turned it down.

02:00:20.756 --> 02:00:24.207
Riley, we've been over this.
It was too much. I couldn't accept it.

02:00:24.301 --> 02:00:28.465
I still have this splinter that's been festering
for three months from an old piece of wood.

02:00:28.556 --> 02:00:29.587
OK, I'll tell you what.

02:00:29.682 --> 02:00:33.514
Next time we find a treasure
that redefines history for all mankind,

02:00:33.602 --> 02:00:35.595
you make the call on the finder's fee.

02:00:35.688 --> 02:00:38.143
That's not as funny.

02:00:38.232 --> 02:00:40.271
What do you care?
You got the girl.

02:00:41.277 --> 02:00:42.985
- It's true.
- It's true.

02:00:46.407 --> 02:00:48.530
Rub it in.
Enjoy your spoils...

02:00:48.617 --> 02:00:51.102
while I sit on one per cent.

02:00:52.699 --> 02:00:55.569
One stinkin' per cent.
Half of one per cent, actually.

02:00:56.119 --> 02:00:58.526
One per cent. Unbelievable.

02:00:58.621 --> 02:01:00.614
I'm sorry for your suffering, Riley.

02:01:00.707 --> 02:01:05.084
For the record, Ben,
I like the house.

02:01:05.169 --> 02:01:08.585
You know, I chose this estate
because in 1812 Charles Carroll met...

02:01:08.673 --> 02:01:13.465
Yeah, someone that did something
in history and had fun. Great. Wonderful.

02:01:13.553 --> 02:01:15.296
Could have had a bigger house.

02:01:24.063 --> 02:01:27.764
- I made something for you.
- You did? What?

02:01:27.859 --> 02:01:29.851
- A map.
- A map?

02:01:31.362 --> 02:01:33.272
Where does it lead to?

02:01:33.364 --> 02:01:36.235
You'll figure it out.
