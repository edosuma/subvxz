- Wallace!
My daughter!

00:06.540 --> 00:07.508
Lexi, she's in there.

00:07.541 --> 00:10.111

00:10.144 --> 00:12.480
Lexi!

00:12.513 --> 00:13.514
[siren wails]

00:13.547 --> 00:16.317
- Sergeant!

00:16.350 --> 00:18.186
That fire was intentionally set.

00:18.219 --> 00:19.520
This was mass murder.

00:19.553 --> 00:21.289
- Lex!
- Come on, come on.

00:21.322 --> 00:22.623
Let us take care of her.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.527
- Scissors.

[suspenseful music]

00:29.563 --> 00:31.065
*

00:31.099 --> 00:32.333
Her chest can't expand
to accommodate

00:32.366 --> 00:33.401
the breath from the vent.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.136
We need to release the skin.
- Chest escharotomy?

00:35.169 --> 00:36.170
- Yeah.

00:36.204 --> 00:43.244

[beeping]

01:04.565 --> 01:05.566
- Air pressures are coming down.

01:05.599 --> 01:08.369
Sats are coming up.

01:08.402 --> 01:11.139
- All right.

01:11.172 --> 01:13.474
- Al.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.143
How's Lexi?
Is--is she okay?

01:15.176 --> 01:18.146
[somber music]

01:18.179 --> 01:19.147
*

01:19.180 --> 01:20.581
What?
Tell me.

01:20.614 --> 01:22.516
Tell me.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.885
- She's in critical condition.

01:24.918 --> 01:26.354
- What?

01:26.387 --> 01:28.222
- She's in critical condition,
baby.

01:28.256 --> 01:30.558
- [crying]

01:30.591 --> 01:33.127
Where is she?
- It's okay.

01:33.161 --> 01:35.129
*

01:35.163 --> 01:37.465
- Can I see her?

01:37.498 --> 01:39.333
I need to see her.

01:39.367 --> 01:41.469
- Hey, hey.
- I need to see her.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.704
- This is Meredith, Lexi's mom.
- Hi, Meredith.

01:43.737 --> 01:45.706
- This is Dr. Halstead,
Jay's brother.

01:45.739 --> 01:49.243
- So Lexi has burns
over 60% of her body.

01:49.277 --> 01:51.245
- What?

01:51.279 --> 01:54.682
- We had to make incisions in
the burned area of Lexi's chest

01:54.715 --> 01:57.618
to improve her ability
to breathe.

01:57.651 --> 02:01.322
I'll continue to update you
every step of the way.

02:01.355 --> 02:04.192
- And you're going to save her.
Please?

02:04.225 --> 02:07.161
*

02:07.195 --> 02:08.496
- We're gonna do our best.

02:08.529 --> 02:11.332
- Oh.
- Let the man do his job.

02:11.365 --> 02:12.433
Come on.

02:12.466 --> 02:14.368
*

02:14.402 --> 02:15.436
Take a seat.

02:15.469 --> 02:17.371
- You take--

02:17.405 --> 02:19.607
you--you take good care of her.

02:19.640 --> 02:21.609
You take good care of her.

02:21.642 --> 02:28.249
*

02:28.282 --> 02:29.717
Hey.

02:29.750 --> 02:34.255
*

02:34.288 --> 02:37.291
Now, you find whoever
set that fire,

02:37.325 --> 02:39.593
and I want him alone.

02:39.627 --> 02:45.266
*

02:45.299 --> 02:46.667
- [crying]
My baby.

02:46.700 --> 02:49.270
- It's okay.
- My baby.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.771
- Detectives
and arson investigators

02:50.804 --> 02:54.542
from across the city will not
rest until the individual

02:54.575 --> 02:58.279
or individuals responsible
are brought to justice.

02:58.312 --> 03:01.549
This cowardly act has robbed
many of our Chicago citizens

03:01.582 --> 03:04.252
of their future.

03:04.285 --> 03:07.988
I'm being told
that the structure was a home

03:08.021 --> 03:09.590
to many young
and talented artists.

03:09.623 --> 03:13.294
*

03:13.327 --> 03:15.696
If those responsible
are watching this,

03:15.729 --> 03:17.498
you're about to feel
the full strength and scope

03:17.531 --> 03:20.334
of the Chicago
Police Department.

03:20.368 --> 03:21.402
Any questions?

03:21.435 --> 03:24.405
[tense music]

03:24.438 --> 03:25.606

03:25.639 --> 03:27.975
- Stone.
- Hey.

03:28.008 --> 03:29.577
- Antonio.

03:29.610 --> 03:30.744
- The entire
State's Attorney's office

03:30.778 --> 03:32.713
and investigators
are at your disposal.

03:32.746 --> 03:34.482
- Good.
- What do you need?

03:34.515 --> 03:36.484
- Just to have your people
in Felony Review

03:36.517 --> 03:40.554
ready to sign some warrants.
- Done.

03:40.588 --> 03:43.391
- Hank, I know
Detective Olinsky's daughter

03:43.424 --> 03:44.525
is among the injured...
- Mm-hmm.

03:44.558 --> 03:46.794
- But when I get this case file,
it's got to be legit,

03:46.827 --> 03:48.762
by the numbers and tight.

03:48.796 --> 03:51.832
*

03:51.865 --> 03:53.401
- Hey, Sarge!

03:53.434 --> 03:59.273
*

03:59.307 --> 04:02.310
Hey, when we responded to
the call, this door was locked--

04:02.343 --> 04:04.345
so we thought--
so we just pried the door open.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.613
- Uh-huh.

04:05.646 --> 04:08.749
- You see these scratches?
- Yeah.

04:08.782 --> 04:11.485
- Whoever did this,
when they exited,

04:11.519 --> 04:13.487
they jammed these metal wedges
underneath the door.

04:13.521 --> 04:18.826
*

04:18.858 --> 04:22.663
- Excuse me a second.
- Yeah.

04:22.696 --> 04:24.632
- Sergeant.
- Chief Lugo.

04:24.665 --> 04:25.799
- We have a task force
assembled,

04:25.833 --> 04:28.736
but I want you and Intelligence
to run your investigation.

04:28.769 --> 04:31.071
- Understood.
- All right.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.574
But find the son of a bitch
who did this.

04:33.607 --> 04:40.648
*

04:45.886 --> 04:47.721
[footsteps approaching]

04:50.858 --> 04:52.860
- I got a relief sergeant
to cover the front desk,

04:52.893 --> 04:55.363
so I'm here to help.
- Great.

04:55.396 --> 04:58.766
Uh, these are our 36 DOAs.

04:58.799 --> 05:02.570
And the 18 over there
are in the ICU at Med.

05:07.441 --> 05:09.677
- All right, thank you.
All right, hey,

05:09.710 --> 05:12.546
that was a parole officer
in East Garfield Park.

05:12.580 --> 05:14.682
She has an ex-con
named Nathan Delano

05:14.715 --> 05:16.384
who did 18 years for arson

05:16.417 --> 05:18.352
and attempted homicide
in Stateville

05:18.386 --> 05:21.422
because he lit his family
on fire back in 1998,

05:21.455 --> 05:23.724
including three
of his own children.

05:23.757 --> 05:26.594
So this guy failed
to report in yesterday.

05:26.627 --> 05:27.828
She marked him down
for the violation,

05:27.861 --> 05:30.664
but his last known address
was 4133 South Wells.

05:30.698 --> 05:32.900
That's six blocks
from the Kimball Factory.

05:32.933 --> 05:35.436
There's a active warrant out
for his arrest.

05:35.469 --> 05:38.138
- Yeah.
- Let's go.

*

06:26.954 --> 06:28.856
All right.

- Many of the victims had only
recently moved to Chicago.

06:31.992 --> 06:33.527
Family members
are still arriving

06:33.561 --> 06:34.862
from around the country,

06:34.895 --> 06:38.065
heartbroken,
searching for answers.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.601
[gunshots]

- [panting]

06:57.050 --> 06:58.552
Get off me!

06:58.586 --> 07:01.088
You pigs! Get off me!
- Come on. Get up.

07:01.121 --> 07:04.057
Get up!

07:04.091 --> 07:06.560
- That's not Delano.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.228
- [grunts]
- What's your name?

07:08.261 --> 07:09.963

- Come on.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.538
*

07:17.571 --> 07:19.006
- Lane Cromwell.

07:19.039 --> 07:20.974
He and Nathan Delano
were cellmates

07:21.008 --> 07:23.644
at Stateville for four years.
- Hmm.

07:23.677 --> 07:27.648
- He's wanted on an extraditable
felony warrant from St. Louis.

07:27.681 --> 07:30.117
He beat a cab driver
half to death.

07:30.150 --> 07:34.622
Priors for unlawful restraint,
aggravated battery,

07:34.655 --> 07:36.657
assaulting a police--
you get the idea.

07:36.690 --> 07:38.158
- Hmm.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.998
- Yeah, I'm gonna
head back upstairs.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.266
- That's probably a good idea.

07:46.299 --> 07:47.535
- Uh-huh.

07:50.103 --> 07:51.872
- You spit on that floor again,
you're gonna be

07:51.905 --> 07:54.642
licking it back up, trust me.
[door closes]

08:02.583 --> 08:05.152
Nathan Delano.
Where is he?

08:05.185 --> 08:07.721
- I know you know who I am.

08:07.755 --> 08:10.558
I know I'm going back to prison
for the rest of my life.

08:10.591 --> 08:12.192
So save it.
- Hmm.

08:12.225 --> 08:14.928
- You got nothing to offer me.

08:14.962 --> 08:18.666
- That's a fair point.

08:18.699 --> 08:21.034
Fair point.

08:21.068 --> 08:23.637
But your little brother--
what's his name again?

08:23.671 --> 08:25.138
Aaron.

08:25.172 --> 08:28.709
He's doing six years
at Menard, isn't that right?

08:28.742 --> 08:31.211
Yeah, it says here
he's in, uh,

08:31.244 --> 08:33.046
administrative segregation.

08:33.080 --> 08:36.549
Apparently he's having some
problems in gen pop.

08:36.583 --> 08:39.186
I don't know, but, uh,

08:39.219 --> 08:42.690
judging by his intake photo,
I'm guessing he's just--

08:42.722 --> 08:44.725
just a little too fetching.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.562
- You can't touch him.

08:48.596 --> 08:49.763
- Oh, no?
- No.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.932
- Wanna hear something
really funny?

08:51.965 --> 08:55.769
The warden at Menard
used to be my Deputy Chief.

08:55.803 --> 08:58.005
Uh-huh.
Yeah.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.273
See, his wife, she wanted
to move out to the country,

09:00.307 --> 09:02.676
so he took the warden gig

09:02.710 --> 09:07.114
and she finally got her garden.

09:07.147 --> 09:10.217
So I'd say inside of 30 minutes,
I could have your baby brother

09:10.250 --> 09:13.787
tossed in that yard
like a little dog treat.

09:13.821 --> 09:15.989
[smooches]

09:21.094 --> 09:22.796
- I don't know where Nathan is!

09:26.399 --> 09:28.301
He packed a bag real quick
and drove off

09:28.335 --> 09:31.204
two minutes before
your cop buddies rolled up.

09:31.238 --> 09:33.206
- Did he torch that warehouse?

09:34.742 --> 09:37.244
Did he torch that warehouse?

09:40.113 --> 09:43.717
- I have no idea.
I wasn't there and I didn't ask.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.185
- So why'd he blow off
his check-in

09:45.218 --> 09:48.388
with his parole officer
yesterday?

09:48.421 --> 09:49.790
- He'd been using.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.391
He knew he wouldn't pass
the piss test,

09:51.424 --> 09:55.295
so we were gonna skip town.

09:55.328 --> 09:58.365
Head up to Alaska, where a buddy
of mine owns a fishing boat.

09:58.398 --> 10:02.269
- Okay, what's he driving?

10:02.302 --> 10:04.304
What's he driving?

10:04.337 --> 10:07.307
[soft dramatic music]

10:07.340 --> 10:09.176
*

10:09.209 --> 10:13.146
Suit yourself.

10:13.180 --> 10:15.148
- A '94 green Toyota.

10:15.182 --> 10:18.351
*

10:18.385 --> 10:22.289
Stolen out of Wisconsin.

10:22.322 --> 10:29.362
*

10:32.199 --> 10:34.334
- Copy that. Thanks.
Okay, Sarge,

10:34.367 --> 10:36.369
we got a statewide BOLO
out there on Delano

10:36.403 --> 10:37.838
and the stolen Toyota.

10:37.871 --> 10:39.372
- So here's what
we're up against, boss.

10:39.406 --> 10:41.809
The warehouse was without
any residential permits,

10:41.842 --> 10:44.044
so there's no records,
no lease agreements,

10:44.077 --> 10:46.346
no video cameras,
and the person who knew the most

10:46.379 --> 10:48.716
was the owner, Barry Kimball,
who shot himself in the face

10:48.749 --> 10:50.317
yesterday at Firehouse 51.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.686
- Right, Delano's previous
arson, he tried to kill

10:52.720 --> 10:54.121
his own family members.

10:54.154 --> 10:56.056
So it's a good bet,
if he's behind this one,

10:56.089 --> 10:58.425
he has some personal connection
to someone inside.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.460
- Hey, this is interesting.

11:00.493 --> 11:03.196
Barry Kimball took out
additional commercial

11:03.230 --> 11:05.833
property insurance
on the warehouse six months ago.

11:05.866 --> 11:08.468
He doubled his policy.
- Insurance scam?

11:08.501 --> 11:09.569
- Maybe.
- Somehow crosses paths

11:09.602 --> 11:11.805
with Delano and then gets him
to torch the place.

11:11.839 --> 11:14.708
- Says he has a live-in
girlfriend, Stacia Mulaney.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.844
We can check his apartment.
- Good. Do it.

11:20.347 --> 11:23.283
- She almost came home.

11:23.316 --> 11:27.154
We had lunch last week.

11:27.187 --> 11:31.158
I said, you know,
you've given this guy two years.

11:31.191 --> 11:36.396
It's time...
to pursue your own dreams.

11:36.429 --> 11:41.268
And so I went back that next day

11:41.301 --> 11:44.805
and she had her bag packed.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.840
*

11:46.874 --> 11:48.909
So I opened the car door.

11:48.942 --> 11:52.345
*

11:52.379 --> 11:53.781
She just shook her head.

11:53.814 --> 11:55.883
She was crying.

11:55.916 --> 11:58.919
*

11:58.952 --> 12:03.523
You know,
she couldn't leave him.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.358
"He needs me, Dad."

12:05.392 --> 12:08.862
*

12:08.896 --> 12:10.864
[sighs]

12:10.898 --> 12:13.533
- [sniffles]
This is a nightmare.

12:13.566 --> 12:15.535
- Yeah, for a lot of people.

12:15.568 --> 12:17.504
- Barry was just trying to help.

12:17.537 --> 12:18.906
They were artists and musicians

12:18.939 --> 12:20.407
who couldn't afford
regular rent.

12:20.440 --> 12:22.275
They made a community there.

12:22.309 --> 12:24.744
- Do either of these men
look familiar to you?

12:27.214 --> 12:29.149
- No.

12:29.182 --> 12:31.218
- Why did Barry take out
extra insurance on the warehouse

12:31.251 --> 12:33.887
six months ago?
- I don't know.

12:33.921 --> 12:36.356
He kept me out of that stuff.

12:38.458 --> 12:39.793
- When he killed himself
at the firehouse,

12:39.827 --> 12:41.228
he had an unregistered gun.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.796
Why would he be
walking around with that?

12:42.830 --> 12:44.497
- He was being threatened.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.199
- By who?
- He didn't say,

12:46.233 --> 12:48.335
but he started to get
really paranoid.

12:48.368 --> 12:50.003
- Threatened about what?

12:50.037 --> 12:51.404
- Money.

12:51.438 --> 12:53.306
I don't know.
Like I said, Barry kept me out

12:53.340 --> 12:56.276
of all of that stuff.
- Okay.

12:56.309 --> 12:57.577
Stacia, I'm gonna
ask you something

12:57.610 --> 13:00.580
and I'm only gonna ask once.

13:00.613 --> 13:02.916
Do you know who was after
your boyfriend

13:02.950 --> 13:05.919
or who could have started
that fire?

13:05.953 --> 13:07.420
- No.

13:10.223 --> 13:12.325
- Okay.

13:12.359 --> 13:14.294
- Keep your phone on.
Don't leave town.

13:16.363 --> 13:18.231
- We'll be in touch.

13:19.432 --> 13:23.570
- Yeah.
[computer beeping]

13:23.603 --> 13:26.339
I got a hit.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.575
I ran the Wisconsin plate
on Delano's stolen Toyota

13:28.608 --> 13:30.277
through NVLS plate reader

13:30.310 --> 13:31.611
and got two consecutive hits,

13:31.644 --> 13:34.447
both indicating
the 3400 block of Pulaski.

13:34.481 --> 13:36.316
- All right, Lindsay and
Halstead should be right there.

13:36.349 --> 13:37.550
Have them respond.
- Yeah.

13:37.584 --> 13:40.553
[tense music]

13:40.587 --> 13:47.827
*

13:50.463 --> 13:52.065
- Here.

14:06.947 --> 14:09.382
[gunshots]
[grunting, shouting]

14:09.416 --> 14:11.018
- Get out of the way!

14:11.051 --> 14:14.287
[dramatic music]

14:14.321 --> 14:15.388
- [grunts]

14:15.422 --> 14:17.324
*

14:17.357 --> 14:20.460
[grunts]
[horn blaring]

14:20.493 --> 14:21.995
- Stop! Police!

14:22.029 --> 14:26.666

14:26.699 --> 14:27.667
[tires screeching]

14:27.700 --> 14:29.536
[grunts]

14:29.569 --> 14:31.104
5021 George.

14:31.138 --> 14:32.973
Armed offender fleeing westbound
on 29th Street.

14:33.006 --> 14:35.008
Get me some cars!
- Copy that.

14:35.042 --> 14:36.977
- Out of the way!

14:37.010 --> 14:39.679
- [grunts and groans]

14:39.712 --> 14:42.382
- Do not move!

14:42.415 --> 14:43.917
Let go of the gun.
Let go of the gun.

14:43.951 --> 14:44.817
Let it go!

14:44.851 --> 14:46.920
5021 George.
Shots fired by the police.

14:46.954 --> 14:49.689
Offender is down.
4000 block of West 29th Street.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.692
Roll an ambulance.
- Copy that. Bus is on the way.

14:52.725 --> 14:55.395
- 5021 George's other half.
Can you tell that ambulance

14:55.428 --> 14:57.064
to kick it in the ass, please?

14:57.097 --> 14:58.999
Hey, partner, you all right?

14:59.032 --> 15:00.500
Jay, are you there?

15:00.533 --> 15:02.402
- Yeah, I'm fine.

15:02.435 --> 15:05.038
5021 squad, be advised...
- You're gonna be okay.

15:05.072 --> 15:07.007
- Offender didn't make it.

15:16.083 --> 15:16.216
.

15:16.249 --> 15:16.950
- Hey.
- Oh, I've got something.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.987
We were able to pull some video

15:20.020 --> 15:23.090
off one of the phones
recovered from the warehouse.

15:23.123 --> 15:24.157
[club music plays on video]

15:24.191 --> 15:27.160
[indistinct chatter on video]

15:27.194 --> 15:34.234
*

15:37.170 --> 15:38.738
[explosion booming]

15:38.771 --> 15:41.108
[screaming]

15:41.141 --> 15:42.342
- Okay, back it up.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.410
[screaming continues]

15:43.443 --> 15:45.012
[sound plays in reverse]

15:45.045 --> 15:47.747
[explosion booming]

15:47.780 --> 15:50.217
That guy was leaving fast.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.352
- Stop.

15:52.385 --> 15:53.520
Zoom in.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.457
That's our killer.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.261
- Yep.

16:08.535 --> 16:11.238
- We're up to 38.

16:11.271 --> 16:16.043
- So...based on the proximity
of the suspect to the stairs--

16:16.076 --> 16:17.310
which we measured
at the warehouse--

16:17.344 --> 16:20.180
he should be about 5'9",
figure 150 pounds.

16:20.213 --> 16:21.781
- And how tall was Delano?

16:21.814 --> 16:26.186
- Oh, Delano was
a little over six feet.

16:26.219 --> 16:27.454
[phone buzzing]

16:29.356 --> 16:31.491
- Hey, guys, um,
so there's gonna be

16:31.524 --> 16:33.793
a candlelight vigil tonight
at the warehouse.

16:33.826 --> 16:36.063
At 8:00, FYI.

16:36.096 --> 16:40.400
- So...the block
the warehouse is on.

16:40.433 --> 16:44.071
Strings signify security cameras
from private companies

16:44.104 --> 16:45.405
and what angles they access.

16:45.438 --> 16:47.474
- All right, I want footage
going back one month.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.376
And I want access
to all these cameras.

16:49.409 --> 16:50.743
- All right.
[phone buzzes]

16:50.777 --> 16:53.113
- Hey, it's my C.I.
I'll be right back.

16:57.384 --> 16:59.519
- What's up, man?
- What you got for me?

16:59.552 --> 17:00.587
- Yeah, man, you know
the dude who owned

17:00.620 --> 17:02.355
the warehouse, Kimball?
- Yeah.

17:02.389 --> 17:04.191
- You know, we know each other
'cause I used to supply

17:04.223 --> 17:05.558
some folks who live
in the warehouse.

17:05.592 --> 17:07.194
- Right, right, right.
I understand that, Rashad.

17:07.227 --> 17:08.095
That's why I called you.

17:08.127 --> 17:11.498
- Well, he hit me up
a couple weeks ago.

17:11.531 --> 17:13.500
Wanted me to take care
of a situation for him.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.367
You know, turns out,
these dudes were trying

17:15.402 --> 17:16.836
to shake him for some money.

17:16.868 --> 17:17.904
Wanted me to step in,
intervene,

17:17.936 --> 17:20.173
you know, do my thing.
- Okay, wait, wait, wait.

17:20.207 --> 17:21.141
When did I ask you
for information

17:21.174 --> 17:23.776
about the warehouse, Rashad?
- This morning.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.512
- Honestly, I think somewhere
down the line,

17:25.545 --> 17:27.214
a miscommunication developed
between us,

17:27.247 --> 17:28.481
and I take full responsibility
for that.

17:28.515 --> 17:32.119
I get it, but I'ma clarify it
for you right now.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.620
We in business together.
You work for me.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.288
You understand that?
You give me information,

17:35.322 --> 17:37.290
I give you cash,
and keep your ass out of jail.

17:37.324 --> 17:38.591
Yes or no?
- Yes.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.327
Of course.

17:40.360 --> 17:43.530
- 38 people died, Rashad.

17:43.563 --> 17:46.833
You can't slow-walk this to me
six hours later, bro.

17:46.866 --> 17:48.535
I swear on everything I love,
if that happens again,

17:48.568 --> 17:50.570
your life is gonna change.

17:50.603 --> 17:54.207
Do you copy me?
- Copy.

17:54.241 --> 17:56.209
- Now, you were saying.

17:56.243 --> 17:57.076
- Look, this dude named K.D.

17:57.110 --> 17:58.511
was trying to
shake Kimball down, man.

17:58.545 --> 17:59.546
- Mm-hmm.
- That's all he told me.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.414
I never saw the dude.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.416
Just told me to be ready.

18:03.450 --> 18:06.253
Might about to put the ball
back in K.D.'s court.

18:08.521 --> 18:11.224
[alarm sounding]

18:11.258 --> 18:13.293
- She's bradying down.
- Milligram of Atropine.

18:13.326 --> 18:19.632
*

18:19.666 --> 18:23.570
- It's not working.
Get one of Epi.

18:23.603 --> 18:25.438
- Heart rate, 20.
She's a peri-arrest.

18:25.472 --> 18:26.473
- Sats are down
to single digits.

18:26.506 --> 18:28.441
[flatline tone]

18:28.475 --> 18:29.676
- I can't get a pulse.
- Asystole!

18:29.709 --> 18:32.445
- Get on her chest.
Start CPR.

18:32.479 --> 18:34.514
Another dose of Epi, now.
[machine beeping]

18:34.547 --> 18:40.153
*

18:40.187 --> 18:43.456
- Mr. Washington...
your daughter's stable.

18:43.490 --> 18:45.325
- Ooh, thank you!
- Sure.

18:45.358 --> 18:48.395
[indistinct chatter]

18:52.532 --> 18:55.202
[indistinct conversation]

18:57.670 --> 18:59.372
- I'll be right back.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.882
Will.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.484
Now, I've had to give
a lot of notifications

19:11.518 --> 19:14.421
to families over the years,
so I know how hard it is.

19:14.454 --> 19:16.923
So you don't have to sugarcoat
anything for me.

19:16.956 --> 19:19.459
All right?

19:19.492 --> 19:23.630
Okay, so...

19:23.663 --> 19:25.398
is Lexi gonna make it?

19:29.502 --> 19:32.272
- Her heart already stopped.

19:32.305 --> 19:35.275
And, uh, we were able
to get it going again.

19:35.308 --> 19:37.744
She's in multi-organ failure.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.546
There's just nothing more
we can do.

19:39.579 --> 19:42.449
[somber music]

19:42.482 --> 19:44.917
I'm so sorry, Al.

19:44.951 --> 19:48.355
*

19:48.388 --> 19:50.657
I'm so sorry.

19:50.690 --> 19:57.730
*

19:59.999 --> 20:02.969
[machine beeping]

20:03.002 --> 20:10.243

20:14.314 --> 20:15.682
- Baby.

*

20:19.719 --> 20:22.689
[flatline tone]

20:56.623 --> 20:56.756
.

20:56.789 --> 20:58.625
- Lexi died 20 minutes ago.

21:02.729 --> 21:07.300
So we can mourn when the scumbag
who did this is in cuffs.

21:10.337 --> 21:12.004
Till then, what do we got?

21:15.041 --> 21:17.910
Hmm?
- Uh, yeah.

21:17.944 --> 21:19.679
Right, yeah.

21:19.712 --> 21:21.914
Um...

21:21.948 --> 21:23.350
the lab did an enhancement

21:23.383 --> 21:26.619
on the suspect
leaving the warehouse.

21:26.653 --> 21:28.988
They were able
to identify the logo

21:29.021 --> 21:31.591
on the right shoulder
of the suspect's jacket.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.761
The brand is ForeRange.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.764
The cargo jacket looks like
the one the suspect is wearing.

21:40.132 --> 21:43.102
There's five retail stores
in Chicago that carry the brand.

21:43.135 --> 21:45.772
They're sending me the last
six months of security footage

21:45.805 --> 21:48.875
and all their cash and their
credit card transactions.

21:52.745 --> 21:55.615
Okay.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.117
- All right, Kev, what's up
with the tip you got on K.D.?

21:58.150 --> 22:02.589
- Yeah, we got
about 85 registered gangbangers

22:02.622 --> 22:04.123
with those initials
in our database.

22:04.156 --> 22:06.759
- And I cross-referenced
the initials K.D.

22:06.793 --> 22:08.928
with everyone who's contacted
Kimball's phone.

22:08.961 --> 22:09.929
Nothing.

22:09.962 --> 22:12.131
- These are all
in-service calls and any paper

22:12.164 --> 22:14.367
generated on the warehouse.

22:14.401 --> 22:16.903
Most of the calls came
from the same landline.

22:16.936 --> 22:19.972
Same woman.
Claire Burke.

22:20.006 --> 22:22.842
She's made over 40
suspicious persons calls.

22:22.875 --> 22:25.878
The last was three nights ago,
and she lives

22:25.912 --> 22:27.814
down the block
from the warehouse.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.084
- You and Jay.

22:38.090 --> 22:45.131
*

23:25.237 --> 23:27.239
[dog barking in distance]

23:31.110 --> 23:33.079
- This is how it always happens.

23:33.112 --> 23:35.948
Y'all don't show up
until it hits the fan.

23:35.982 --> 23:38.017
- Uh, Detectives Lindsay
and Halstead.

23:38.050 --> 23:39.786
Are you Claire Burke?
- Yes.

23:39.819 --> 23:40.953
And before you leave,
I wanna get

23:40.987 --> 23:43.790
the correct spelling of your
names, your badge numbers,

23:43.823 --> 23:45.492
and what unit
you're assigned to.

23:45.525 --> 23:46.693
- Not a problem, ma'am.

23:46.726 --> 23:48.728
We're here about
the warehouse fire.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.797
The gentleman who owned it
was named Barry--

23:50.830 --> 23:51.898
- I know who he is.

23:51.931 --> 23:53.833
And he packed them damn kids
in there like sardines.

23:53.866 --> 23:54.901
Treated them about as good, too.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.503
- Did you notice anything
the night of the fire?

23:56.536 --> 23:58.938
Anything suspicious?
- Night before, I did.

23:58.971 --> 23:59.872
- Okay.
- Barry had been having

23:59.906 --> 24:01.841
this heated conversation
with another man,

24:01.874 --> 24:03.810
right down the street.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.978
I was sitting in that window,
and I could see it all.

24:06.012 --> 24:08.848
This man kept thumping
Barry's chest like this.

24:08.881 --> 24:10.783
And I told that old hairbag
Officer Keating

24:10.817 --> 24:13.219
when he finally showed up
45 minutes later.

24:13.252 --> 24:15.221
But did Officer Keating
follow up with me?

24:15.254 --> 24:16.956
Hell no.

24:16.989 --> 24:18.891
- Okay, any other details
about the man?

24:18.925 --> 24:20.259
- White gentleman.
Brown hair.

24:20.292 --> 24:21.894
A little shorter than you,
looked like--

24:21.928 --> 24:22.895
- How much shorter?

24:22.929 --> 24:25.064
- Oh, so you interrupt people?

24:25.097 --> 24:25.998
- Sorry, ma'am.
- I didn't have

24:26.032 --> 24:28.100
a measuring stick,
so I can't say for sure.

24:28.134 --> 24:29.235
But he was in his 20s, though.

24:29.268 --> 24:30.770
And I got
his license plate number.

24:30.803 --> 24:31.971
Wrote it down.
- Really?

24:32.004 --> 24:33.506
Any chance you have
security cameras?

24:33.540 --> 24:34.907
- What am I? Fort Knox?
No, I don't have

24:34.941 --> 24:35.975
any damn security cameras.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.109
But I got eyeballs.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.110
And that guy had been by here

24:38.144 --> 24:40.079
three times to talk to Barry.

24:40.112 --> 24:41.180
He wasn't bringing nothing
but bad news.

24:41.213 --> 24:44.884
Next thing you know,
39 young people get called home

24:44.917 --> 24:46.485
way before their time.

24:49.556 --> 24:51.290
I'll go get you
that license plate number.

24:51.323 --> 24:55.061
- Appreciate it.

24:55.094 --> 24:56.028
- Boss, ran the plate.
- Yeah?

24:56.062 --> 24:58.965
- Came back to a Kade Davis.
- Kade Davis?

24:58.998 --> 25:02.569
- Yeah.
26 years old, 5'8", 170 pounds.

25:02.602 --> 25:04.036
No criminal history, though.

25:04.070 --> 25:07.540
- Get a photo array together.
- Okay.

25:07.574 --> 25:09.776
- Him.
No doubt in my mind.

25:09.809 --> 25:12.612
- Thank you very much
for your help.

25:12.645 --> 25:15.014
- Finally, a cop does something
in this city.

25:15.047 --> 25:17.283
*

25:17.316 --> 25:19.318
- Lock him into the area,

25:19.351 --> 25:22.121
dump his phone, run his vehicle.

25:22.154 --> 25:25.524
I want everything on this prick
before we move on him.

25:29.896 --> 25:31.163
Al.

25:38.070 --> 25:40.640
We're so sorry.

25:40.673 --> 25:42.074
- Thanks.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.813
- Well, listen.
Let's get you home.

25:46.846 --> 25:49.048
Be with Meredith.

25:49.081 --> 25:50.617
- No.

25:52.619 --> 25:53.886
- Alvin, do you wanna

25:53.920 --> 25:55.221
get some coffee?
- No.

25:55.254 --> 25:58.958
- Or maybe talk to the Chaplain
or Peer Support?

25:58.991 --> 26:03.930
- No, I just wanna know
what's going on with this case.

26:03.963 --> 26:08.935
- Well, we're, uh,
we're moving in on a suspect.

26:08.968 --> 26:13.139
But it's nothing rock-solid yet.

26:13.172 --> 26:14.373
- Yeah.

26:14.406 --> 26:17.677
*

26:17.710 --> 26:19.378
Yeah.

26:19.411 --> 26:26.653
*

26:29.288 --> 26:31.924
- Hi, how are you?
- I'm great. Thanks for asking.

26:31.958 --> 26:34.661
Do you have a reservation?

26:34.694 --> 26:36.228
- It's all good.

26:36.262 --> 26:38.264
I'm looking for the Davis party,

26:38.297 --> 26:40.366
and I'm wondering
if they're here.

26:40.399 --> 26:42.869
- Yes.
- Don't look.

26:42.902 --> 26:44.403
Just tell me where they are.

26:44.436 --> 26:46.372
- By the window.
He's having dinner

26:46.405 --> 26:50.376
with a pretty Asian woman.

26:50.409 --> 26:52.044
- Thank you.

26:52.078 --> 26:53.279
Stay right here.

26:53.312 --> 26:56.282
[tense music]

26:56.315 --> 27:03.389
*

27:05.091 --> 27:07.426
Kade Davis.
- Can I help you?

27:07.459 --> 27:09.195
- Yeah.

27:09.228 --> 27:11.030
You can stand up for me.

27:11.063 --> 27:12.298
- I'd like to know
what this is about.

27:12.331 --> 27:16.035
- What's the problem here?
- Back up.

27:16.068 --> 27:18.370
- We can keep this civil.
- I'm not going anywhere till--

27:18.404 --> 27:20.907
[grunts]

27:20.940 --> 27:21.941
The hell do you think
you're doing?

27:21.974 --> 27:24.443
- Hands up.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.445
- Huh.
- [chuckles]

27:26.478 --> 27:29.048
[handcuffs ratcheting]
Where you taking me?

27:29.081 --> 27:31.751
- Where do you think?
Move your ass.

27:38.725 --> 27:38.858
.

27:38.891 --> 27:39.959
- Hmm.

27:42.762 --> 27:44.063
Al. Al!

27:44.096 --> 27:46.766
- What?
- Hey.

27:46.799 --> 27:49.168
You can't go in there, buddy.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.837
- I'm just gonna watch, man.
Hang back.

27:50.870 --> 27:53.840
- Not with this.

27:53.873 --> 27:57.710
Look, the observation room,
that's it.

27:57.744 --> 28:00.780
I got it.

28:00.813 --> 28:02.148
- Come on, man.

28:08.187 --> 28:09.688
- Huh.

28:12.124 --> 28:13.793
Quite the family tree you got.

28:13.826 --> 28:15.895
[door closes]

28:15.928 --> 28:18.965
So your Uncle Patty,
he was a ward superintendant

28:18.998 --> 28:22.134
till he got swept up
in Operation Silver Shovel

28:22.168 --> 28:24.904
for felony theft
and racketeering.

28:24.937 --> 28:27.173
The paperwork says he flipped
on a couple of aldermen

28:27.206 --> 28:30.743
for a reduction in sentence.

28:30.777 --> 28:33.479
Your cousin, Finn,
one-time city inspector.

28:33.512 --> 28:36.182
He got pinched for bribes,
money laundering,

28:36.215 --> 28:37.449
threatening a witness.

28:37.483 --> 28:39.118
- What am I doing here?

28:44.857 --> 28:48.460
- Barry Kimball.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.930
- Don't know him.

28:50.963 --> 28:54.266
- Hmm.

28:54.300 --> 28:56.535
So...

28:56.568 --> 29:00.206
you're gonna deny to my face

29:00.239 --> 29:04.210
knowing or interacting
with Barry Kimball,

29:04.243 --> 29:06.979
whose warehouse got torched?

29:07.013 --> 29:08.848
- That's what I said.

29:08.881 --> 29:11.851
[tense music]

29:11.884 --> 29:14.320
[grunts]

29:14.353 --> 29:17.089
- Here's what I think went down.

29:17.123 --> 29:19.058
You tried to squeeze money
out of Kimball.

29:19.091 --> 29:20.960
Told him you'd rat him out
to the city

29:20.993 --> 29:22.995
'cause you have connections.

29:23.029 --> 29:26.332
And he refused to pay
or he stopped paying.

29:26.365 --> 29:29.268
So you went back to your
dirtbag relatives for advice

29:29.301 --> 29:34.140
and they told you
you had to get tough.

29:34.173 --> 29:38.310
So you went back to that
warehouse during that rave

29:38.344 --> 29:39.979
and you torched that place.

29:40.012 --> 29:40.980
- I did not--

29:41.013 --> 29:43.816
*

29:43.850 --> 29:48.855
- Kid...

29:48.888 --> 29:50.823
if the next thing out
of your face is,

29:50.857 --> 29:55.194
"I don't know Barry Kimball"...

29:55.227 --> 29:57.163
we're gonna go for a ride.

29:57.196 --> 30:00.867
*

30:00.900 --> 30:04.103
- All right.
I squeezed Kimball for money.

30:04.136 --> 30:06.939
He wouldn't pay, and yeah,
I had people in my ear

30:06.973 --> 30:11.010
telling me what the next level
should be, but it wasn't arson.

30:11.043 --> 30:13.946
And no way did I
light that place up.

30:13.980 --> 30:17.149
I didn't start that fire.
You look all you want.

30:17.183 --> 30:22.121
*

30:22.154 --> 30:23.856
- Come on.

30:23.890 --> 30:30.930
*

30:36.202 --> 30:40.606
- Yeah, your brother
operated on Lexi.

30:40.639 --> 30:44.376
So please tell him
I said thanks.

30:44.410 --> 30:48.014
I know he gave it
everything he had.

30:48.047 --> 30:49.381
- I will.

30:49.415 --> 30:52.384
- Yeah.

30:52.418 --> 30:54.386
Yeah.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.389
[somber music]

30:57.423 --> 31:04.964
*

31:04.997 --> 31:07.299
- All right, I want
a full work-up on this guy.

31:07.333 --> 31:08.935
Search his apartment.
Let's tie him

31:08.968 --> 31:11.170
to that brown ForeRange jacket.
- Okay.

31:11.203 --> 31:14.173
That was patrol.
Tamra Collins just woke up

31:14.206 --> 31:17.109
in the ICU at Med,
and she wants to talk.

31:17.143 --> 31:18.677
- All right.
Kim, you go with.

31:18.710 --> 31:19.946
- Yeah.

31:26.052 --> 31:28.387
- Sweetheart,
the police are here.

31:32.158 --> 31:34.060
- Hi, Tamra.

31:34.093 --> 31:35.194
My name is Erin Lindsay,

31:35.227 --> 31:38.030
and Kim Burgess is here
as well.

31:38.064 --> 31:40.432
You had something
you wanted to tell us?

31:40.466 --> 31:43.302
- Yes.

31:43.335 --> 31:45.371
I was there at the rave.

31:45.404 --> 31:50.109
And this guy stood--
stood next to me.

31:50.142 --> 31:54.413
He was wearing a...
a dark jacket

31:54.446 --> 31:58.050
and a--and a hat.

31:58.084 --> 32:01.220
And he was holding a paper bag.

32:01.253 --> 32:04.490
He walked over to the side
and he--

32:04.523 --> 32:07.393
he dropped the paper bag
on the floor.

32:07.426 --> 32:09.361
And then stepped on it.

32:09.395 --> 32:11.697
Then he kicked it
behind the couch.

32:11.730 --> 32:14.466
He--he started to walk away

32:14.500 --> 32:18.304
and then the bag burst
into flames.

32:18.337 --> 32:21.273
*

32:21.307 --> 32:24.510
- Do you remember
anything else about him?

32:24.543 --> 32:27.413
- Uh, he was a little bit taller
than me.

32:27.446 --> 32:31.250
So, 5'8", maybe.

32:31.283 --> 32:35.154
And a white guy.

32:35.187 --> 32:39.258
In his 20s.

32:39.291 --> 32:44.363
He had a-a silver skull ring
on his right hand.

32:44.396 --> 32:47.433
I-I noticed it
when he wiped his eyebrow.

32:47.466 --> 32:51.103
- That's really good.

32:51.137 --> 32:52.404
Is there anything else, or--

32:52.438 --> 32:55.474
- Yeah he--he had blue eyes.

32:55.507 --> 32:57.743
- Blue?
Are you sure?

32:57.776 --> 32:59.045
- [crying]

32:59.078 --> 33:02.048
When he looked at me,
it was like

33:02.081 --> 33:04.316
he was looking right through me.

33:04.350 --> 33:09.288
*

33:09.321 --> 33:11.190
- Thank you.

33:11.223 --> 33:15.194
- All right, we're looking
for a male, white, 20-25,

33:15.227 --> 33:17.796
owns a brown
ForeRange cargo jacket,

33:17.829 --> 33:20.299
he wears a silver skull ring
on his right hand,

33:20.332 --> 33:24.436
he's about 5'8",
and he has blue eyes.

33:24.470 --> 33:27.073
- We'll run everyone in the city
with that description--

33:27.106 --> 33:29.475
all DMV, city, county,
and state employees,

33:29.508 --> 33:31.243
anyone with a public record.

33:31.277 --> 33:33.479
- Kick Kade Davis?

33:33.512 --> 33:36.348
- Charge him with the gun first.

33:36.382 --> 33:38.550
- So we're nowhere.

33:42.621 --> 33:46.392
- We got that vigil
in an hour, Sarge.

33:46.425 --> 33:49.361
- All right,
everybody, get ready.

34:57.663 --> 35:00.299
moving to my right.

35:00.332 --> 35:02.501
- That one, there.
- Right there.

35:02.534 --> 35:04.503
*

35:04.536 --> 35:06.138
Halstead, coming to you,
brother.

35:06.172 --> 35:13.212
*

35:15.581 --> 35:16.582
- Headed north.

35:16.615 --> 35:23.655
*

35:31.197 --> 35:33.265
- I got eyes. He's going
westbound down the alley.

35:33.299 --> 35:40.339

35:42.274 --> 35:44.610
- Yeah, you can stop
right there.

36:02.728 --> 36:04.563
Put him in the cage.

36:19.911 --> 36:20.045
.

36:20.078 --> 36:21.079
- Dylan Oates, 22. He's got
an apartment on West 18th.

36:22.914 --> 36:25.717
- Call Felony Review,
get a warrant.

[tense music]

36:28.754 --> 36:29.721

*

36:37.863 --> 36:39.998
It's clear!

36:40.031 --> 36:41.967
- Clear!

*

36:57.783 --> 37:00.319
Jay!
In here!

- I work with a detective.

37:25.911 --> 37:27.846
I mean, he's a--

37:27.879 --> 37:29.881
he's a really good friend
of mine.

37:29.915 --> 37:32.918
[tense music]

37:32.951 --> 37:35.587
You killed his daughter
in that fire.

37:38.724 --> 37:39.858
I mean, I knew her
her whole life.

37:39.891 --> 37:43.829
She was...

37:43.862 --> 37:47.299
just one of those people who
made the world a better place.

37:47.333 --> 37:51.337
I mean, she just...
had a glow.

38:04.115 --> 38:06.318
to the scene of the crime,
but I had a real strong hunch

38:06.352 --> 38:09.087
you would anyway.

38:09.120 --> 38:13.659
Because I know
this crime was personal.

38:13.692 --> 38:17.696
You wanted to hurt someone
'cause someone hurt you.

38:17.729 --> 38:18.830
Tell me if I'm wrong.

38:18.864 --> 38:20.966
*

38:20.999 --> 38:23.402
[grunts]
Tell me if I'm wrong!

38:23.435 --> 38:29.708
*

38:29.741 --> 38:32.844
So who was it?
Hm?

38:32.878 --> 38:35.747
Who pissed you off, huh?

38:35.781 --> 38:37.583
Who broke your little heart?

38:37.616 --> 38:38.850
- I have the right
to remain silent.

38:38.884 --> 38:42.621
I understand that right, and I
do not wish to speak with you.

38:42.654 --> 38:48.627
*

38:48.660 --> 38:51.630
- You're gonna tell me
why you lit that fire.

38:51.663 --> 38:55.401
Believe me.

38:55.434 --> 38:58.136
Or you're gonna feel pain

38:58.169 --> 39:02.808
like you never imagined
was possible.

39:02.841 --> 39:05.777
- I have the right to remain--
- Which you have!

39:05.811 --> 39:08.747
*

39:08.780 --> 39:10.949
[footsteps approaching]

39:10.982 --> 39:11.950
- Off me! Get off me!
- Al.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.885
Al, come on, Al!
- Get off me!

39:13.919 --> 39:15.621
- Come on, Al! Al!
- Get--

39:15.654 --> 39:17.022
- Al!
Come on, man!

39:17.055 --> 39:19.658
- Get off me! Get off me!
- Al, come on, man.

39:19.691 --> 39:22.994
- Get--get off me!
- Hey, it's okay. We're good.

39:23.028 --> 39:24.796
Door's locked, we're good.
- Hank, take a walk, man.

39:24.830 --> 39:26.131
Give me the keys.
- Al.

39:26.164 --> 39:29.768
- Give me the keys!
- Al, listen to me.

39:29.801 --> 39:31.470
We're gonna turn him over
to the State's Attorney--

39:31.503 --> 39:33.705
- No, we're not!
- Yes, we are!

39:33.739 --> 39:34.906
- No, we're not.
- Look, it's killing me.

39:34.940 --> 39:36.975
But it's the only way, Al.
- Hey, when Justin was killed,

39:37.008 --> 39:39.745
what did you do?
Huh?

39:39.778 --> 39:40.879
Would you have let anybody
stop you if they tried?

39:40.912 --> 39:44.049
- We got 39 families looking
for justice, not just one.

39:44.082 --> 39:46.151
- Oh, so you don't think
that they'd be happy to hear

39:46.184 --> 39:48.887
that this animal
was dredged out of the river?

39:48.920 --> 39:50.489
- I don't know that!

39:50.522 --> 39:52.157
I don't know that,
and neither do you.

39:52.190 --> 39:54.159
And that's why it's gotta
go down this way.

39:54.192 --> 39:55.827
- Give me the keys.
- I can't do that, Al!

39:55.861 --> 39:57.095
I'm sorry.
- I'm warning you, man.

39:57.128 --> 39:59.731
- Well, then you're gonna have
to go through me to get him out.

39:59.765 --> 40:01.066
Go ahead.
[door opens]

40:01.099 --> 40:08.106
*

40:13.845 --> 40:17.749
- Al.

40:17.783 --> 40:20.986
Heard you had a suspect.
Wanted to check in.

40:21.019 --> 40:23.221
- There he is.
- He confessed.

40:23.254 --> 40:30.996
*

40:31.029 --> 40:34.232
- Okay. To who?
- Me.

40:34.265 --> 40:41.507
*

40:44.142 --> 40:46.011
- [sighs]

40:46.044 --> 40:51.049
*

40:51.082 --> 40:54.052
[indistinct shouting, jeering]

40:54.085 --> 41:01.159
*

41:11.603 --> 41:13.271
[crowd clamoring]
- Murderer!

41:13.304 --> 41:15.173
*

41:15.206 --> 41:17.943
- He should die!
- Why did he do it?

41:17.976 --> 41:25.016
*

41:27.152 --> 41:28.920
[siren whoops]

41:28.954 --> 41:35.994
*

42:15.166 --> 42:18.203
[wolf howls]
