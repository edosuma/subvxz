00:26.292 --> 00:27.194
Huh? Hmm.

00:32.898 --> 00:33.930
Hmm.

00:33.932 --> 00:35.398
Hey Emmi! Can't you hear it?

00:35.400 --> 00:36.899
The bell just rang!

00:36.901 --> 00:39.099
We're gonna be late!

00:39.101 --> 00:41.736
Then let's go!

00:41.738 --> 00:42.371
Come on!

00:54.981 --> 00:57.983
I hope they don't
start without us.

01:02.687 --> 01:04.321
Ah, it's about time.

01:05.155 --> 01:06.354
Hop on in.

01:06.356 --> 01:07.958
Sorry.

01:23.769 --> 01:25.768
Now, we'll hear the
story of the Easter eggs.

01:25.770 --> 01:29.371
A long time ago, there was
a winter with so much snow

01:29.373 --> 01:31.105
that the animals in the forest

01:31.107 --> 01:33.175
couldn't find anything to eat,

01:33.177 --> 01:37.243
and were dependent on
the help of the humans.

01:37.245 --> 01:39.445
And as the snow began to melt,

01:39.447 --> 01:42.815
the animals wanted to
show their gratitude.

01:42.817 --> 01:44.750
The chickens gave eggs.

01:44.752 --> 01:46.984
Everyone helped in dying
them different colors,

01:46.986 --> 01:51.054
and the spry rabbits carried
them to the children.

01:51.056 --> 01:54.423
And that's how
Easter came to be.

01:54.425 --> 01:56.459
But when the foxes
saw just how much

01:56.461 --> 01:58.460
the rabbits were loved for this,

01:58.462 --> 02:01.962
they wanted to deliver
the Easter eggs too.

02:01.964 --> 02:04.498
But the foxes'
hearts weren't in it.

02:04.500 --> 02:07.300
All that Easter work
was just too much.

02:07.302 --> 02:10.133
Hiding the eggs was
too much trouble.

02:10.136 --> 02:12.404
Many Easter baskets
remained empty,

02:12.406 --> 02:15.506
and Easter almost disappeared.

02:15.508 --> 02:16.874
Awe.

02:16.876 --> 02:18.408
The animals
gathered together,

02:18.410 --> 02:23.077
and decided from then on they
should only be Easter rabbits.

02:23.079 --> 02:25.879
As a symbol of this,
they were presented with

02:25.881 --> 02:30.783
a golden egg to give them
inner strength and courage.

02:30.785 --> 02:34.955
An egg that we rabbits have
kept well hidden ever since

02:36.289 --> 02:39.793
so that Easter will never
be endangered again.

02:43.863 --> 02:46.528
And now, you all will
soon be able to take part

02:46.530 --> 02:48.931
in the Easter
Rabbit Examinations

02:48.933 --> 02:51.832
to bring the spirit of
Easter out into the world,

02:51.834 --> 02:54.170
and joy to all the children.

02:57.005 --> 02:57.939
I'll say.

02:59.273 --> 03:02.274
And may it always
remind us of our mission

03:02.276 --> 03:06.444
as Easter rabbits.

03:06.446 --> 03:07.747
Emmi.

03:15.419 --> 03:19.789
Since when do we
need a trap to catch rabbits?

03:21.457 --> 03:22.822
What are they up to?

03:22.824 --> 03:24.991
Our golden egg.

03:27.162 --> 03:28.827
That's beautiful!

03:36.234 --> 03:38.501
I don't believe it.

03:38.503 --> 03:42.874
That's where the golden egg
is hidden, the golden egg.

04:01.854 --> 04:03.520
Hmm!

04:22.169 --> 04:23.004
Hmm.

04:29.541 --> 04:30.375
Hmm?

04:35.345 --> 04:36.180
Yep.

04:46.553 --> 04:47.188
Huh?

05:22.580 --> 05:23.950
Hmm.

05:24.883 --> 05:26.882
Hmm, awesome!

05:26.884 --> 05:28.050
Hi!

05:28.052 --> 05:29.618

Nice!

05:50.335 --> 05:51.901
Hey, what's up, dudes?

05:51.903 --> 05:54.135

05:54.137 --> 05:54.969

05:54.971 --> 05:56.371
Yo.

05:56.373 --> 05:57.539
Hey, holms!

05:57.541 --> 05:59.072
Dig, bin shopping.

05:59.074 --> 06:01.074
Brand new store just opened.

06:01.076 --> 06:03.210
Oh, nah, too far.

06:03.212 --> 06:05.479
I'll get blisters
on my paws, yo.

06:05.481 --> 06:09.247
Yo, who said anything
about walkin', huh?

06:09.249 --> 06:10.448
Hey!

06:10.450 --> 06:13.918
Be chill, man, it's
for a good cause.

06:13.920 --> 06:17.987
Awesome idea, huh!

06:24.327 --> 06:25.625
Okay.

06:25.627 --> 06:26.694
Last stop!

06:26.696 --> 06:27.631
Hop on off!

06:32.601 --> 06:35.401
Yo, what'd I tell ya', huh?

06:35.403 --> 06:38.335
Whoa, it's the leader
of the Shockwave Rabbits.

06:38.337 --> 06:42.039
Yo, dude, you're
pretty dope, huh.

06:42.041 --> 06:42.940
Who?

06:42.942 --> 06:43.572
Me?

06:43.574 --> 06:45.708
Yeah, I guess so.

06:45.710 --> 06:49.345
Easter Sunday, 12 o'clock.

06:49.347 --> 06:51.445
Behind the old freight yard.

06:51.447 --> 06:52.450
Thank you.

06:54.283 --> 06:55.516
Wait!

06:55.518 --> 06:57.451
What's goin' down there?

06:57.453 --> 07:00.052
Gand tryouts, but
only if you're there.

07:00.054 --> 07:01.322
See you around.

07:02.456 --> 07:03.491
Whoa.

07:06.025 --> 07:07.357
Oh, man oh man.

07:07.359 --> 07:10.560
They make you do tough
stuff in those tryouts.

07:10.562 --> 07:13.529
Hey Max, do you really
wanna join the gang?

07:13.531 --> 07:14.764
The Shockwave Rabbits?

07:14.766 --> 07:18.465
Of course, I do, hombres, that
is the coolest gang around.

07:18.467 --> 07:21.601
And you only get one
chance in your lifetime.

07:21.603 --> 07:23.103
And what about us, huh?

07:23.105 --> 07:24.971
Yeah, guess you'll
just be ditching us.

07:24.973 --> 07:26.472
Hmm?

07:26.474 --> 07:29.341
Hey, once I'm in the gang,
bros, I'll get you in too.

07:29.343 --> 07:30.442
- Deal?
- Okay.

07:30.444 --> 07:31.575
Really?

07:31.577 --> 07:32.344
- Ear bump?
- Duh, of course.

07:32.346 --> 07:36.646
It'll be way coolio!

07:36.648 --> 07:39.248
And that is why we're gonna
need some cool threads.

07:45.521 --> 07:46.355
Huh.

07:58.430 --> 07:59.500
Whoa, cool.

Ah.

08:09.538 --> 08:10.772
Oh, what

08:10.774 --> 08:15.210
I'm gonna bend someone's ear
when I find out who did this.

08:16.412 --> 08:19.779
Kids, leavin' their
stupid toys around.

08:25.485 --> 08:27.650

08:27.652 --> 08:29.586
Okay, we go on three.

08:29.588 --> 08:30.754
One.

08:30.756 --> 08:31.721
Three!

08:31.723 --> 08:32.621
Huh?

08:35.658 --> 08:37.625
A rabbit?

08:37.626 --> 08:39.659
What do you think
this is, Easter?

08:39.660 --> 08:43.597
Get the, cotton tail!

08:46.034 --> 08:47.034
Ron, Atze?

08:49.668 --> 08:52.536
That was so awesome, dude.

08:55.807 --> 08:58.673
Hmm?

Yo, what was that?

09:02.478 --> 09:03.311
Hangin' me out to dry!

09:03.313 --> 09:05.180
What are you
even talkin' about?

09:05.182 --> 09:06.346
That was way funny.

09:06.348 --> 09:10.315
Man, I had my paws on a
wicked cool leather jacket!

09:10.317 --> 09:11.416
Hmm!

09:11.418 --> 09:13.552
Check it out, you can
wear this in your tryout.

09:13.554 --> 09:15.721
What is up with you?

09:15.723 --> 09:18.356
Oh, pretty, can I have it?

You want this?

09:28.599 --> 09:30.501

- What is that?

09:32.068 --> 09:34.069
Oh, the Rabbit School.

09:35.637 --> 09:37.170
That old fairytale book?

09:37.172 --> 09:38.471
Hey, you guys are mean.

09:38.473 --> 09:40.373
Notice how their
eyes all shine,

09:40.375 --> 09:42.407
learning to paint
the shell so fine.

09:42.409 --> 09:43.274
Hey, give
it back to me.

09:43.276 --> 09:45.310
If you fail, this
may sound funny,

09:45.312 --> 09:47.143
you'll never be an Easter bunny.

09:47.145 --> 09:48.344
Give me it!

09:48.346 --> 09:51.580
I would so like to
go the Rabbit School.

09:51.582 --> 09:52.482
Seriously?

09:52.484 --> 09:54.817
You don't really believe
it exists, do you?

09:54.819 --> 09:57.518
Of course I do,
now give me that!

09:57.520 --> 09:59.189
- My pleasure.

09:59.856 --> 10:02.089

- Awesome, throw, bro.

10:08.296 --> 10:09.560
It's cool.

10:09.562 --> 10:10.661
Thank you.

10:13.666 --> 10:14.597
What's up here?

10:14.599 --> 10:15.665
It's just a little girl, man.

10:15.667 --> 10:17.600
I thought you wanted
to be a Shockwave Rabbit.

10:17.602 --> 10:20.235
Yo, like, they don't
want any wimps.

10:20.237 --> 10:21.436
Uh-uh.

10:21.438 --> 10:22.570
Huh?

10:28.610 --> 10:29.876

10:29.878 --> 10:32.544
Hey, make like a
banana and split!

10:32.546 --> 10:35.813
Ha, and who's a wimp now?

10:35.815 --> 10:37.882
Take it up a notch!

10:37.884 --> 10:40.250
You asked for it!

10:40.252 --> 10:43.286
Whoa-ho-ho, this
totally rocks!

10:44.556 --> 10:46.354
- The guts.

10:46.356 --> 10:47.890
Gonna be a Shockwave Rabbit!

10:47.892 --> 10:50.558
Gonna be a Shockwave Rab, ahh!

10:50.560 --> 10:53.396
Uh-oh!

10:54.630 --> 10:57.396
You gotta get him
down from up there!

10:57.398 --> 10:58.630
He's too far away!

10:58.632 --> 11:00.199
I totally lost my signal!

11:00.201 --> 11:02.570
You gotta be kidding, oh man.

11:07.539 --> 11:08.374
Whoa!

11:09.574 --> 11:10.874
Whoa!

Huh?

11:20.683 --> 11:22.317
That is way high!

The following
message is addressed

11:32.626 --> 11:35.893
to all parents of young children,
this is a special alert.

11:35.895 --> 11:37.859
Something treacherous
and extremely dangerous

11:37.861 --> 11:41.163
is spreading around the
world, the fox tapeworm.

11:41.165 --> 11:43.698
Refrain from picking
wild berries,

11:43.700 --> 11:45.267
and beware of low hanging...

11:45.269 --> 11:47.233

11:53.540 --> 11:55.507

11:55.509 --> 11:57.708
There is a rabies
alarm at the moment!

11:59.279 --> 12:01.211
That must've been
the Easter rabbit.

12:01.213 --> 12:03.213
Oh, yeah I love
the Easter bunny!

12:06.417 --> 12:08.516
Easter bunny-wunny!

12:08.518 --> 12:10.485
The rabbits are

12:10.487 --> 12:12.754
Just because they
got an golden egg.

12:12.756 --> 12:14.955
And who loves us?

12:14.957 --> 12:15.855
Help!

Help!

12:23.696 --> 12:24.529
No, no, no, no, no!

12:25.764 --> 12:28.232
Hey, Ma', guess what
we just discovered?

12:28.234 --> 12:30.536
Yep, a flyin' Easter rabbit.

12:32.270 --> 12:34.702
Whoa, whoa-whoa-whoa!

12:34.704 --> 12:36.738
Self propelled machine!

12:36.740 --> 12:38.205
And LS-99.

12:38.207 --> 12:40.775
Enough

12:40.777 --> 12:42.708
No, no, no, no, no, no!

12:42.710 --> 12:46.815
You go right through!

12:50.849 --> 12:53.617
Quit gawkin',
and get after him!

12:59.691 --> 13:00.756
Run, Bruno, run!

13:02.593 --> 13:03.425
No!

13:03.427 --> 13:04.258
Paws off!

13:04.260 --> 13:04.895
Ha!

13:06.628 --> 13:07.663
Oh no!

13:10.332 --> 13:11.663
Hey, be careful!

13:11.665 --> 13:13.898
Don't break the airplane.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.376
That's enough!

13:27.945 --> 13:31.578
Rule number 15, with a
paintbrush strong and straight,

13:31.580 --> 13:33.714
the Easter eggs we decorate!

13:35.351 --> 13:37.382
So, now we, may I
have your attention?

13:37.384 --> 13:39.551
Silence!

13:39.553 --> 13:41.852
But Grandpa, that's not us.

13:41.854 --> 13:44.256
Well, oh sweet carrot!

13:44.258 --> 13:45.956
What in the world is that?

13:50.362 --> 13:51.463
Whoa!

13:57.834 --> 14:00.904
Hello, are
you still alive?

14:03.772 --> 14:05.537
An angel.

14:05.539 --> 14:06.971
I must be in rabbit heaven.

14:08.476 --> 14:09.507
Poor you.

14:09.509 --> 14:11.542
I'm Emmi, and you?

14:11.544 --> 14:14.380
Max.

14:15.547 --> 14:17.747
Huh, what's the deal
with the clothes?

14:17.749 --> 14:19.750
Where in the world am I?

14:21.317 --> 14:24.988
Oh, my child, good
thing you didn't get hurt.

14:27.356 --> 14:31.456
Is that like supposed
to be the rabbit school?

14:31.458 --> 14:32.294
No way!

14:33.559 --> 14:37.061
- You guys are for real?
- Beg your pardon!

14:37.063 --> 14:39.329
Hey, of course we're for real.

14:39.331 --> 14:40.631
What, don't you know the book?

14:40.633 --> 14:42.365
"Loaded up, they
hit the trail.

14:42.367 --> 14:44.701
"All you see is the bunny tail."

14:44.703 --> 14:45.768
- Mmm-hmm!
- Mmm-hmm!

14:45.770 --> 14:47.870
You see the bunny tail?

14:47.872 --> 14:49.807
No way, get outta town!

14:50.973 --> 14:52.907
No one will buy
this in the city!

14:52.909 --> 14:55.007
Let me see your
little bunny tail.

14:57.046 --> 15:00.646
You're from the city?

15:00.648 --> 15:01.648
All alone?

15:02.583 --> 15:04.948
You've just had
quite a long journey.

15:04.950 --> 15:06.383
Then to pep you up,

15:06.385 --> 15:08.686
we'll get you a nice
glass of carrot juice.

15:08.688 --> 15:10.853
Eh, carrots, no thanks, man.

15:10.855 --> 15:12.654
When I get home,
I'll chug a soda.

15:12.656 --> 15:14.422
You wish to return right away?

15:14.424 --> 15:15.656
Man, awe.

15:15.658 --> 15:18.458
Of course, I'm not
a country bumpkin.

15:18.460 --> 15:19.392
Hmm.

15:19.394 --> 15:20.660
Do you need any help, perhaps?

15:20.662 --> 15:22.529
Nah, nah, this is
modern technology.

15:22.531 --> 15:23.563
Turbo things, you know.

15:23.565 --> 15:24.697
Just need that expert touch.

15:24.699 --> 15:26.831
Just go do your egg
thingy, whatever.

15:26.833 --> 15:30.835
Very well, as you wish,
let us return to our lessons.

15:30.837 --> 15:32.472
Awe.

15:33.839 --> 15:35.939
Didn't you hear what he said?

15:35.941 --> 15:37.506
So, let's go.

15:37.508 --> 15:38.343
Now.

15:43.045 --> 15:45.745
May I fly a bit with
you before you go?

15:45.747 --> 15:47.650
You? Of course, sure.

15:49.516 --> 15:52.287
Let me get it
ready for take off.

15:55.522 --> 15:57.355
Oh, sweet carrot!

15:57.357 --> 15:59.557
And how will you get
back to the city?

16:06.063 --> 16:08.663
I already told you, you
can't get out through here.

16:08.665 --> 16:10.565
You're all locked up in here.

16:10.567 --> 16:14.000
We're protecting
ourselves from the foxes.

16:14.002 --> 16:16.936
You're afraid of a bunch
of trash chompers, puh!

16:16.938 --> 16:21.438
Yo, I took 'em down without
blinking an eye, ha!

16:21.440 --> 16:22.075
Whoa!

16:22.943 --> 16:25.445
Sir, I don't believe that.

16:26.645 --> 16:28.648
Don't you know the rule?

16:29.748 --> 16:31.513
Getting past a fox so clever,

16:31.515 --> 16:33.714
can only Easter rabbits ever.

16:33.716 --> 16:35.983
Huh? That's ridiculous!

16:35.985 --> 16:37.985
Yo, you don't know city rabbits.

16:37.987 --> 16:40.587
Ugh, psst, a showoff.

16:40.589 --> 16:42.455
Ah, huh, wait a minute!

16:42.457 --> 16:44.957
Who has the key to the gate?

16:44.959 --> 16:48.460
Alone by foot, I
can't allow that.

16:48.462 --> 16:50.161
The foxes are lying in wait.

16:50.163 --> 16:51.929
Someone must take you there.

16:51.931 --> 16:54.597
But there is no time for that
til after Easter, I'd say.

16:54.599 --> 16:55.564
After Easter?

16:55.566 --> 16:57.766
But I wanna go home now.

16:57.768 --> 16:59.901
Impossible, but
if you like we could

16:59.903 --> 17:02.736
let your parents know
via carrier pigeon.

17:02.738 --> 17:04.873
I don't have like
parents anymore.

17:04.875 --> 17:07.473
All the same, I gotta go back!

17:07.474 --> 17:11.143
Why don't you find yourself
a place in the dormitory.

17:11.145 --> 17:13.411
Our lessons begin at 8 o'clock.

17:13.413 --> 17:16.147
I'm sure Emmi can tell you
the rules of the school.

17:16.150 --> 17:17.580
Dormitory?

17:17.583 --> 17:18.448
Rules?

17:18.450 --> 17:20.150
Yo, not with me.

17:20.152 --> 17:21.684
Mm-hmm.

17:21.685 --> 17:22.618
Ah.

17:22.621 --> 17:23.723
- Shh.
- Mm-mm.

17:25.688 --> 17:26.655
A-huh.

17:26.656 --> 17:28.955
Uh...

17:28.957 --> 17:31.658
You nearly lost this here.

17:31.660 --> 17:33.729
Thank you, well, I never.

17:34.897 --> 17:36.195
And who was that?

17:36.197 --> 17:38.663
Madam Hermine,
our master trainer.

17:38.665 --> 17:40.766
How did you get my key again?

17:40.768 --> 17:41.766
Nevermind.

17:41.768 --> 17:42.967
She sees all, and knows all.

17:42.969 --> 17:46.737
And the day, it
started out so well.

17:46.739 --> 17:48.604
The golden egg?

17:48.606 --> 17:51.440
Right here in front
of our snouts?

17:51.442 --> 17:53.809
And you only just found it?

17:53.811 --> 17:56.210
You're a disgrace
for your mother!

17:56.212 --> 17:58.111
But you can change all that.

17:58.113 --> 17:59.947
Get me that golden egg,

17:59.949 --> 18:04.050
and then once again
we'll be Easter foxes.

18:04.052 --> 18:08.423
That'll be the end of those
cutesy, cuddly, Easter rabbits!

18:23.700 --> 18:24.735
Hmm?

18:44.149 --> 18:46.650
Let's see what we have here.

18:48.585 --> 18:49.884
Mmm.

18:49.886 --> 18:50.721
Ah.

18:52.821 --> 18:54.089
Oh, a fox head.

18:55.957 --> 18:56.792
Oh no.

19:10.701 --> 19:12.168
Hey, sleepyhead,
time to get up.

19:12.170 --> 19:13.935
What, who, where!

19:13.937 --> 19:14.772
Ow!

19:18.608 --> 19:20.610
Oh, man, I'm still here?

19:21.842 --> 19:24.776
I was hoping that
was just a nightmare.

19:24.778 --> 19:25.711
A nightmare?

19:25.713 --> 19:26.712
No way!

19:26.714 --> 19:28.713
It is absolutely beautiful here.

19:28.715 --> 19:30.650
You'll see soon enough.

19:38.588 --> 19:40.623
Ahh!

19:40.625 --> 19:42.856
What, six o'clock?

19:42.858 --> 19:45.758
I'm usually going to
bed at this time, dude!

19:45.760 --> 19:46.595
Eh?

19:48.197 --> 19:49.227
A-ha!

19:49.229 --> 19:50.696
What's hanging up there?

19:50.698 --> 19:51.964
Hmm, nothing.

19:51.966 --> 19:53.631
It looked like a key.

19:53.633 --> 19:56.636
And even if it
was, we have to go.

19:58.070 --> 20:01.807
Please come down, we're
gonna get in trouble.

20:03.675 --> 20:06.707
Yes, you're right that is
the spare key to the gate,

20:06.709 --> 20:11.212
but the rooster will crow
if you open up his door.

20:14.950 --> 20:17.082
I guess there's no need to worry
about you opening the door.

20:17.084 --> 20:19.884
And it crows every
hour on the hour?

20:19.886 --> 20:23.621
Come on, I think I
know just what you need.

20:23.623 --> 20:25.656
A breakfast croissant
and a hot chocolate

20:25.658 --> 20:28.791
with extra whip cream on top.

20:31.328 --> 20:34.963
Now, hug the tiger,
and breathe together.

20:37.233 --> 20:38.666
Huh, exercise?

20:38.668 --> 20:40.199
Morning sport when
bright and sunny

20:40.201 --> 20:44.102
makes a nimble Easter
bunny, rule number two.

20:44.104 --> 20:45.337
No, thanks.

20:45.339 --> 20:46.738
Without a hot shower
in the morning,

20:46.740 --> 20:49.706
I ain't worth diddly-squat.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.808
A hot shower?

20:51.810 --> 20:54.344
- What does he mean by that?
- Mm-mm.

20:54.346 --> 20:57.046
♪ While prompt to bed
and quick to rise ♪

20:57.048 --> 21:00.114
♪ Makes rabbits
strong and wise ♪

21:00.116 --> 21:03.083
♪ While prompt to bed
and quick to rise ♪

21:03.085 --> 21:06.152
♪ Makes rabbits
strong and wise ♪

21:06.154 --> 21:09.924
♪ La la la la la la la la la ♪

21:12.660 --> 21:14.658
Don't you have like
electricity around here?

21:14.660 --> 21:18.329
Like those little things in
the wall for light and phones?

21:18.331 --> 21:20.664
And warm water?

21:20.666 --> 21:22.167
Ha, who need it?

21:24.636 --> 21:26.104
Talk about peculiar.

21:28.738 --> 21:30.974
Water's overrated anyway.

21:32.375 --> 21:34.708
- Ugh, and just what is that?
- This?

21:34.710 --> 21:36.178
It's spring flowers?

21:39.212 --> 21:41.714
No, this is a spring flower.

21:43.182 --> 21:45.782
It's like being on the
far side of the moon here.

21:50.121 --> 21:51.189
A fox head?

21:52.822 --> 21:55.756
- You mean, Easter is in danger?
- That is how it looks.

21:55.758 --> 21:57.925
Then we must warn
all the students.

21:57.927 --> 22:01.894
We should keep the carrot
oracle to ourselves for now.

22:01.896 --> 22:06.698
- Fear is a poor advisor.
- But what should we do, huh?

22:06.700 --> 22:08.002
Be very mindful.

22:10.802 --> 22:14.037
And have faith in
our inner strength.

22:14.039 --> 22:17.105
You'll hear about
the fox whose mean.

22:17.107 --> 22:19.374
How he traps you unforeseen.

22:19.376 --> 22:21.942
He hides in forest and in field,

22:21.944 --> 22:24.977
a ghastly presence
he does wield.

22:24.979 --> 22:27.680
Tracks can help us rabbits flee,

22:27.682 --> 22:30.051
but we must know them properly.

22:31.753 --> 22:33.051
Me, pick me.

22:33.053 --> 22:34.753
I know it as well!

22:34.755 --> 22:36.420
Oopsie daisy.

22:36.422 --> 22:37.320
Over here!

22:37.322 --> 22:39.389
Me, me, I
got it, I know it.

22:39.391 --> 22:40.822
Please.

22:40.824 --> 22:43.194
A badger, a skunk, and a fox.

22:44.727 --> 22:46.228
Correct, very good.

22:46.230 --> 22:48.029
And what is this one here?

22:48.031 --> 22:50.197
Correct, sneaker
with a rubber sole.

22:50.199 --> 22:52.298
It's clearly a city rabbit.

22:52.300 --> 22:54.167
Put your foot down, Max!

22:54.169 --> 22:57.169
And further more,
rule number 24.

22:57.171 --> 22:59.103
To give an
answer, it's the law,

22:59.105 --> 23:02.372
we must learn to raise our paw.

23:02.374 --> 23:04.710
You'll learn that in time.

23:05.910 --> 23:08.177
The arrow shows the
direction of the wind.

23:08.179 --> 23:09.811
Where should you run, hmm?

23:09.813 --> 23:11.813
So that the fox can't smell you?

23:11.815 --> 23:13.149
I know, Anton.

23:17.086 --> 23:19.689
- Finished, teacher sir.
- Wow.

23:22.756 --> 23:25.723
Huh, well, that's
not right, Anton.

23:25.725 --> 23:26.624
What do you mean?

23:26.626 --> 23:29.093
Bet you'll learn
that in time, Anton.

23:29.095 --> 23:30.027
Huh?

23:30.029 --> 23:30.864
Rrrr!

23:32.065 --> 23:34.363
All that stuff you're learning
is just a bunch of hot air.

23:34.365 --> 23:36.698
If you see a fox,
a zig and a zag,

23:36.700 --> 23:39.004
turbo charge, and you're gone!

23:40.203 --> 23:43.036
Piece of cake!

23:43.038 --> 23:44.707
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whao!

23:48.310 --> 23:50.475
And do you guys do
sports in the city?

23:50.477 --> 23:51.476
Of course we do!

23:51.478 --> 23:53.712
Poodle riding, flying,
cool stuff, you know,

23:53.714 --> 23:56.447
but not lame-o sports like, oh!

23:56.449 --> 23:57.282
Dude!

24:06.490 --> 24:07.322
This is where we practice

24:07.324 --> 24:10.661
for the Easter
Rabbit Examination.

24:12.228 --> 24:14.494
- Wow, that is like way...
- That is cool, right?

24:14.496 --> 24:16.095
Ah, well, not bad.

24:40.148 --> 24:41.780
Ha-ha!

24:41.782 --> 24:42.882
Pay attention.

24:42.884 --> 24:46.918
Now we get to see the best
trick, the disapperious!

24:52.424 --> 24:53.422
Huh?

24:53.424 --> 24:55.491
That's a big part of
how we hide the eggs.

24:55.493 --> 24:58.960
Wow, amazing, he
managed six earlong.

25:05.967 --> 25:08.167
I can make it
to four earlongs.

25:08.169 --> 25:10.802
Really, then show me
real quick how you do it!

25:10.804 --> 25:12.437
With that, I can be
like way super fast!

25:12.439 --> 25:13.405
Real quick?

25:13.407 --> 25:17.206
The disapperious needs
a whole lot of practice.

25:17.208 --> 25:18.474
Yo, what up?

25:18.476 --> 25:21.009
Well, in time, I'll
learn how to land too.

25:24.815 --> 25:27.315
Listen up people, I've
wasted enough time here.

25:27.317 --> 25:29.816
Have fun in your
little rabbit pen.

25:29.818 --> 25:31.518
Huh?

25:38.491 --> 25:40.258
Crap.

25:40.260 --> 25:42.225
Now, wait a moment.

25:42.227 --> 25:45.995
Where did I put my
glasses this time?

26:00.309 --> 26:03.108
And there, we found
' em once again.

26:06.846 --> 26:08.212
Yeah.

26:15.452 --> 26:17.919
What's all this smoke?

26:17.921 --> 26:21.924
What sly plan are you
concocting this time, hmm?

26:27.062 --> 26:31.463
Oh, my rotten carrots.

26:31.465 --> 26:33.831
The chainsaw
worked just fine.

26:33.833 --> 26:35.200
Got the motor
runnin' this morning,

26:35.202 --> 26:36.335
now just get the rust off.

26:36.337 --> 26:39.502
Yeah, yeah, I always gotta
be doin' the dirty work.

26:39.504 --> 26:42.273
It's always Bruno
that's gotta...

26:43.540 --> 26:44.776
Hmm?

26:46.609 --> 26:47.844
Phew.

26:55.417 --> 26:57.014
Yes, caught
somethin' in the trap!

26:57.016 --> 26:58.617
I knew it'd work.

26:58.619 --> 27:00.851
Well, what do we have here?

27:00.853 --> 27:03.053
A tasty Easter surprise.

27:03.055 --> 27:05.487
I think Ma' is
gonna be real happy.

27:05.489 --> 27:09.457
No, no, you're mistaken
because I'm not edible, you see!

27:09.459 --> 27:13.094
I'm contaminated with
pollution and heavy metals!

27:13.096 --> 27:15.629
I don't think your mother
would enjoy that much!

27:15.631 --> 27:18.131
Please, don't hurt me.

27:18.133 --> 27:20.267
You can have anything you want!

27:20.269 --> 27:21.467
My slimy hand!

27:21.469 --> 27:22.571
My mouthwash!

27:23.605 --> 27:26.438
You could really
use some of that.

27:26.440 --> 27:28.305
Excuse me, you young lads.

27:28.307 --> 27:30.608
Is this the way to
the rabbit school?

27:30.610 --> 27:33.008
No, but it's the
way to Ma's stew.

27:33.010 --> 27:36.847
Come to big Bruno.

27:38.082 --> 27:39.249
Bruno!

27:41.551 --> 27:43.086
Madam Hermine!

27:45.888 --> 27:47.887
Huh, are you nincompoops
breakin' already?

27:47.889 --> 27:49.890
Get away, go and hide.

27:51.324 --> 27:53.523
I'll get you, you
bucktoothed bunny trash!

27:55.896 --> 27:57.931
Ha, you're faster than a...

28:02.467 --> 28:03.969
Now, move, fast!

28:05.669 --> 28:07.902
I think they're escapin'!

28:07.904 --> 28:10.504
Oh, yous, please
come get me down!

28:23.483 --> 28:27.149
The foxes, trap,
traps everywhere!

28:27.151 --> 28:30.452
- He just ran into the forest.
- Is he insane?

28:30.454 --> 28:32.353
And you left the gate open.

28:32.355 --> 28:33.554
You jeopardized the lives

28:33.556 --> 28:35.556
of all the rabbits
who live here!

28:35.558 --> 28:38.560
How did you even
get the key anyway?

28:39.962 --> 28:43.028
I told you that it's
forbidden to take the key.

28:43.030 --> 28:46.032
I'm going to have
a word with you.

28:48.235 --> 28:49.699
Those foxes are scary.

28:49.701 --> 28:50.633
What a jerk!

28:50.635 --> 28:52.435
He's just a city rabbit.

28:52.437 --> 28:53.569
We were all in danger.

28:53.571 --> 28:55.304
He should've known better.

28:55.306 --> 28:58.473
Thank you, that, ah,
that you rescued me.

28:58.475 --> 29:01.509
I mean, it's not,
it's not a given.

29:01.511 --> 29:04.244
Oh, is that what you think?

29:11.618 --> 29:12.986
What a drag.

29:18.691 --> 29:20.392
The leader button!

29:24.127 --> 29:27.230
I lost my ticket
for the gang tryout!

29:28.663 --> 29:29.900
Oh no!

29:36.669 --> 29:38.602
But I can't get
out of here anyway!

29:38.604 --> 29:39.908
Not a chance!

29:43.676 --> 29:45.241
Maybe there is!

29:48.980 --> 29:51.579
You want to become
an Easter rabbit?

29:51.581 --> 29:53.714
In my master class, I
only accept students

29:53.716 --> 29:55.749
who have been
training for years.

29:55.751 --> 29:58.354
It can't be that difficult.

30:03.257 --> 30:04.989
Take a look, piece of cake.

30:04.991 --> 30:05.625
It's easy.

30:12.496 --> 30:15.465
And most importantly, the
path of an Easter rabbit

30:15.467 --> 30:17.702
begins with an inner journey.

30:22.605 --> 30:23.440
Huh?

30:25.674 --> 30:27.473
Ah, Emmi!

30:27.475 --> 30:28.673
Can you practice with me?

30:28.675 --> 30:32.010
- Disapperious and all!
- No, I cannot.

30:32.012 --> 30:34.277
Look, I have to
polish all of them.

30:34.279 --> 30:36.412
It is punishment because of you.

30:36.414 --> 30:39.682
I'm really sorry, but it was
just because I wanna go home.

30:39.684 --> 30:42.584
In any case, you're never
going to be an Easter rabbit

30:42.586 --> 30:44.351
because you only
think of yourself.

30:44.353 --> 30:46.720
You don't care
about anything else.

30:46.722 --> 30:48.455
Huh?

30:48.457 --> 30:52.558
No, but there are great things
waiting for me in the city.

30:52.560 --> 30:53.595
Huh?

30:54.462 --> 30:55.727
What is that?

30:55.729 --> 30:57.729
Is that the foxes?

30:57.731 --> 30:59.498
What's happening?

31:05.803 --> 31:08.470
Don't worry children, the
hedge will keep us safe.

31:08.472 --> 31:10.038
No one's ever gotten through!

31:10.040 --> 31:10.706
Uh, duh!

31:10.708 --> 31:12.373
They've got a chainsaw!

31:12.375 --> 31:14.142
It's not gonna be a
problem to get in here!

31:14.144 --> 31:16.543
Don't be afraid.

31:16.545 --> 31:17.777
No one has ever made it in here.

31:17.779 --> 31:19.345
What are you waiting for?

31:19.347 --> 31:20.780
We have to do something!

31:30.555 --> 31:32.754
Okay, Bruno, no!

31:32.756 --> 31:33.591
Bruno, no!

31:42.598 --> 31:44.232
You block head!

31:45.099 --> 31:46.034
Dip sticks!

31:47.234 --> 31:48.700
But Ma', it was a good plan!

31:48.702 --> 31:49.735
But it didn't work, Einstein!

31:49.737 --> 31:52.605
Get your butts
home, you misfits!

31:54.374 --> 31:56.605
You see, our hedge held.

31:56.607 --> 31:57.573
What?

31:57.575 --> 31:58.411
Ugh!

32:03.247 --> 32:04.081
Hmm.

32:06.550 --> 32:09.349
What were the
foxes trying to do?

32:09.351 --> 32:11.518
They never did anything
like that before?

32:11.520 --> 32:13.685
I would say it's
all his fault.

32:13.687 --> 32:16.623
He's the one who
annoyed the foxes.

32:19.827 --> 32:21.258
Max?

32:21.260 --> 32:23.560
No, it has nothing
to do with Max.

32:23.562 --> 32:25.562
The oracle of the
carrot predicted it.

32:26.531 --> 32:28.296
The foxes are a menace
to Easter this year.

32:28.298 --> 32:29.864
Children: What?

32:29.866 --> 32:31.600
And that means
starting now, together,

32:31.602 --> 32:33.801
we must be
particularly attentive.

32:33.803 --> 32:35.635
Huh, no more, no less?

32:35.637 --> 32:37.838
Just wait around and
munch on carrots.

32:37.840 --> 32:39.805
With an attitude like
that in the city, dude,

32:39.807 --> 32:42.440
you'd like bite the dust.

32:42.442 --> 32:43.277
Hmm.

32:48.680 --> 32:49.748
- Max?
- Huh?

32:51.249 --> 32:53.582
Get me the key to
the gate, please.

32:53.584 --> 32:54.550
What?

32:54.552 --> 32:56.117
Hey, that's against your rules.

32:56.119 --> 32:56.818
Shh.

32:56.820 --> 32:57.853
Psst.

33:01.723 --> 33:04.624
I want to find out what
the foxes are planning.

33:04.626 --> 33:07.227
That is totally kamikaze, man.

33:07.229 --> 33:08.626
But we have to do something.

33:08.628 --> 33:11.162
You said so yourself.

33:11.164 --> 33:13.631
And besides, you owe me a favor.

33:17.803 --> 33:19.436
The wind is alright.

33:19.438 --> 33:22.404
I can make it to the foxes
house without them smelling me.

33:22.406 --> 33:25.607
- Okay, I'm coming along.
- What?

33:25.609 --> 33:28.809
City rule number four, if
you have a real good buddy,

33:28.811 --> 33:31.744
stick with her through
thick and muddy.

33:31.746 --> 33:34.379
Sounds very convincing.

33:41.753 --> 33:42.655
Hmm, Max?

34:05.304 --> 34:06.372
Be careful.

34:11.643 --> 34:14.512
This is for the Easter basket.

34:17.880 --> 34:18.715
Hey!

34:20.649 --> 34:23.752
What are they up
to inside there?

34:26.320 --> 34:27.820
How come
we don't ever get

34:27.822 --> 34:29.821
tasty stuff like that, Ma'?

34:29.822 --> 34:31.723
Do you really
thing human children

34:31.725 --> 34:33.956
like glazed worm
and fried spider?

34:33.958 --> 34:36.759
'Course they do,
they'll be thrilled!

34:36.761 --> 34:39.563
Easter eggs every year
is as dull as dishwater.

34:39.565 --> 34:41.362
If that's what you reckon.

34:42.666 --> 34:44.498
What are they talking about?

34:44.500 --> 34:45.833
No idea.

34:49.370 --> 34:52.304
Hmm, something smells here.

34:52.306 --> 34:55.741
That's a rabbit.

34:55.743 --> 34:57.776
It's comin' from outside!

34:59.312 --> 35:00.945
Oh no, let's run!

35:00.947 --> 35:03.547
Where in the tar is he hidin'?

35:10.688 --> 35:11.922
Smells yummy!

35:13.989 --> 35:15.322
Huh?

35:15.324 --> 35:16.722
Well, I'll be darned!

35:16.724 --> 35:19.528
Gotta be here somewhere, hmm?

35:21.362 --> 35:24.562
I think we have
to get out of here.

35:24.564 --> 35:26.530
- We'll never make it.
- What?

35:26.532 --> 35:30.300
You look there.

35:30.302 --> 35:31.534
Wait a sec.

35:38.474 --> 35:39.641
Suey!

35:39.643 --> 35:41.841
That there ain't
rabbit, that smells!

35:41.843 --> 35:43.679
Like spring flowers.

35:46.347 --> 35:48.714
Oh, golly darn,
I would've loved a rabbit.

35:48.716 --> 35:51.516
Forget it, first fetch
me that golden egg.

35:51.518 --> 35:54.922
Then you catch as many
rabbits as you want.

35:56.654 --> 35:59.824
The foxes discovered
the golden egg!

36:00.758 --> 36:03.325
Let us post cards day and night,

36:03.327 --> 36:05.492
and cover up the
sacred hall of the egg.

36:05.494 --> 36:07.494
We can't let them
get the golden egg.

36:07.496 --> 36:09.363
And regarding you,
my little friend,

36:09.365 --> 36:11.831
it's bad enough that you
ran into the forest again,

36:11.833 --> 36:14.733
but this time around you dragged
Emmi with you on top of it!

36:14.735 --> 36:16.267
It was my idea, Grandpa.

36:16.269 --> 36:18.602
Max just came with me to help.

36:18.604 --> 36:19.869
Mm-hmm.

36:19.871 --> 36:22.740
If that is the case,
then go mend baskets,

36:22.742 --> 36:25.341
- the both of you!
- There's no time for that.

36:25.343 --> 36:27.643
Max, you and I will
meet at sunrise

36:27.645 --> 36:29.878
underneath the weeping willows.

36:29.880 --> 36:30.715
Hmm?

36:32.482 --> 36:36.316
Wow, Max is in the
Easter rabbit training now.

36:36.318 --> 36:38.785
Really, is that true?

36:38.787 --> 36:39.884
Eh, uh-huh.

36:39.886 --> 36:42.320
Yeah!, whoo-hoo!

36:42.322 --> 36:43.054
Ha-ha!

36:43.056 --> 36:44.756
And what about me, hmm?

36:44.758 --> 36:47.695
Emmi, please,
remember rule 23.

36:48.694 --> 36:50.594
You're too small.

36:50.596 --> 36:52.727
You and all your stupid rules!

36:52.729 --> 36:53.662
If it wasn't for Emmi,

36:53.664 --> 36:55.665
you still wouldn't
know what's going on.

36:55.667 --> 36:57.731
She's courageous,
and brave, and, and...

36:57.733 --> 37:00.701
It's okay, Max,
it is the way it is.

37:06.608 --> 37:08.507
Can we start
with the disapperious?

37:08.509 --> 37:10.375
Can we, come on, can we?

37:10.377 --> 37:13.510
One who aspires to fly,
must grow strong roots.

37:13.512 --> 37:14.648
What was that?

37:16.614 --> 37:18.715
I already know how to fly, whoa!

37:18.717 --> 37:20.582
Very well, then it
shouldn't be difficult

37:20.584 --> 37:23.084
to build a great egg
of all those stones.

37:23.086 --> 37:23.920
What?

37:25.587 --> 37:27.355
I don't wanna have
to build an egg!

37:27.357 --> 37:29.790
I wanna start training.

37:29.792 --> 37:30.627
Hmm.

37:33.728 --> 37:35.461
A stone egg?

37:35.463 --> 37:36.831
How stupid is that?

37:42.434 --> 37:45.734
If your new plan don't work,
you're gettin a whoopin'.

37:45.736 --> 37:47.402
Oh, I think it'll work, Mama.

37:47.404 --> 37:49.637
I computed it all in my head.

37:49.639 --> 37:51.673
Huh, you think
you'll be finished

37:51.675 --> 37:53.540
with those baskets by Easter?

37:53.542 --> 37:54.975
Of course I will.

37:54.977 --> 37:56.776
Oh, it'll be wonderful.

37:56.778 --> 37:59.345
Children will sing
gospels to praise us,

37:59.347 --> 38:01.813
they'll pet us, and
feed us, and oh!

38:06.051 --> 38:09.054
See what happens
when you pester me?

38:15.593 --> 38:17.525
What are they up to now?

38:17.527 --> 38:20.393
Well, at least we know
they are up to something,

38:20.395 --> 38:22.663
but the students
are quite diligent.

38:22.665 --> 38:24.630
What a pleasure to see this.

38:24.632 --> 38:25.668
Hmm.

38:28.701 --> 38:32.872
But do you really think that
rascal, Max, can help us?

38:33.905 --> 38:36.875
Be patient,
Eitelfritz, be patient.

38:39.776 --> 38:40.811
Hmm.

38:49.618 --> 38:50.753
Just hold still.

38:52.619 --> 38:53.454
Ah, ga!

38:55.523 --> 38:56.357
Huh.

38:58.859 --> 39:00.626
Exactly, that's it!

39:06.765 --> 39:07.995
Ta-dah!

39:07.997 --> 39:10.131
Hmm, very good idea.

39:10.133 --> 39:13.502
And now, once more
without the sticks.

39:18.673 --> 39:20.773
And how is this
supposed to work?

39:20.775 --> 39:23.808
Look upon the rocks as
if they were a community.

39:23.810 --> 39:26.077
Everyone must find a place
where they are supported,

39:26.079 --> 39:29.478
and can give support
at the same time.

39:29.480 --> 39:30.947
But look at all these rocks!

39:30.949 --> 39:33.716
How can I ever
find the right one?

39:33.718 --> 39:34.917
Try starting with this one.

39:34.919 --> 39:36.550
If you look really closely,

39:36.552 --> 39:38.686
you'll know which
two fit together.

39:38.688 --> 39:42.188
Yeah, well, now I...

39:43.791 --> 39:46.691
Know what I have to
pay attention to.

39:46.693 --> 39:47.958
Huh?

39:47.960 --> 39:48.795
Hmm.

40:00.970 --> 40:01.805
Ha-ha!

40:05.141 --> 40:06.541
Ugh!

40:11.513 --> 40:12.147
Awe!

40:37.032 --> 40:37.867
Huh?

40:42.670 --> 40:44.468
Finished!

40:44.470 --> 40:46.604
This is where you
hide the golden egg?

40:46.606 --> 40:48.204
Could I see it, please?

40:48.206 --> 40:51.507
Outsiders aren't
allowed to see it.

40:51.509 --> 40:53.844
Max is one of us now, hmm.

40:56.947 --> 40:59.748
Awe, is that real gold?

41:04.151 --> 41:06.552
Don't touch it!

41:06.554 --> 41:09.087
Every year new gold
leaves are added.

41:09.089 --> 41:11.988
For every new Easter
rabbit, a new leaf.

41:11.990 --> 41:14.258
So, the egg grows
bigger every year?

41:14.260 --> 41:16.559
Mm-hmm, and stronger.

41:16.561 --> 41:19.761
Madam Hermine says the
egg gives us strength

41:19.763 --> 41:23.265
for The disapperious
and against the foxes.

41:23.267 --> 41:25.166
If the foxes were
to steal the egg,

41:25.168 --> 41:27.701
then there wouldn't be
anymore Easter rabbits,

41:27.703 --> 41:29.703
and Easter would be
a thing of the past.

41:29.705 --> 41:33.708
Foxes aren't really
interested in giving at all.

41:37.544 --> 41:39.776
They will not get the egg.

41:39.778 --> 41:40.711
Huh?

41:46.850 --> 41:48.082
And this one.

41:48.084 --> 41:48.919
Whoa.

41:50.787 --> 41:51.886
Whoa!

41:51.888 --> 41:52.719
Yeah!

41:52.721 --> 41:54.855
And this and this!

41:54.857 --> 41:56.189
Huh.

41:57.758 --> 41:58.593
Ahh!

42:02.695 --> 42:03.727
Ear bump!

42:03.729 --> 42:04.363
Oh yeah!

42:22.143 --> 42:24.943
Whoa, he's almost finished!

42:24.945 --> 42:25.780
Huh?

42:26.948 --> 42:27.779
Wow.

42:27.781 --> 42:28.947
Doubt it.

42:28.949 --> 42:31.585
He'll never get the top done.

42:34.921 --> 42:38.791
Hmm, I believe that
needs an expert touch.

42:39.756 --> 42:40.858
Hmm, and...

42:42.258 --> 42:43.093
Wee, yah!

42:44.760 --> 42:45.793
Wow!

42:45.795 --> 42:47.730
- And now, you.
- Okay.

42:48.696 --> 42:49.499
Hmm, a...

42:50.765 --> 42:51.599
Yes!

42:52.733 --> 42:53.834
Keep going!

42:54.735 --> 42:56.301
Whoa, whoa!

42:56.303 --> 42:57.136
Bingo!

42:58.672 --> 42:59.506
Ha!

43:01.106 --> 43:01.972
Finished?

43:01.974 --> 43:03.173
Yeah, I guess so.

43:03.175 --> 43:04.105
Hmm.

43:04.107 --> 43:06.576
Let's see what we have here?

43:06.578 --> 43:07.212
Ahh, no!

43:10.146 --> 43:11.312
Stop!

43:11.314 --> 43:12.147
Don't!

43:13.648 --> 43:14.284
Don't!

43:17.318 --> 43:19.218
Well, now, there we go.

43:19.220 --> 43:20.154
Told ya'.

43:23.890 --> 43:27.590
From now on, Max will
train with the rest of you.

43:27.592 --> 43:28.724
This is great, Max!

43:28.726 --> 43:29.693
Congrats!

43:29.695 --> 43:30.927
Awesome, Max!

43:30.929 --> 43:32.194
Great news, Max!

43:32.196 --> 43:33.728
I'm so excited!

43:33.730 --> 43:35.297
Crank her up!

43:35.299 --> 43:36.698
All eyes here!

43:36.700 --> 43:38.800
Maybe you can learn
a thing or two.

43:38.802 --> 43:39.869
Careful, Max.

43:41.270 --> 43:42.839
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

43:48.641 --> 43:49.277
Ha-ha!

43:51.078 --> 43:53.713
Ahh!

43:59.783 --> 44:01.350
That's unusual.

44:01.352 --> 44:04.851
Wow, look at
this guys, check it out!

44:04.853 --> 44:06.820
Keep going, Max!

44:06.822 --> 44:08.888
Yeah, go, Max!

44:22.066 --> 44:23.833
- Wonderful!
- You got it!

44:23.835 --> 44:25.400
- You did it!
- Impressive!

44:25.402 --> 44:27.003
Awesome, you did it!

44:27.005 --> 44:28.702
Hey, and now the
disapperious, right.

44:28.704 --> 44:30.671
Is there a kind of
trick I should know?

44:30.673 --> 44:32.806
Close your eyes,
forget yourself,

44:32.808 --> 44:35.711
and become one with
the assignment.

44:38.312 --> 44:38.946
Huh?

44:40.780 --> 44:42.414
Easter rabbits are selfless.

44:42.416 --> 44:45.850
- We want to bring joy.
- I see what you mean.

44:45.852 --> 44:46.951
Let me try it.

44:52.823 --> 44:53.658
Huh?

44:55.225 --> 44:56.059
Yeah!

45:03.132 --> 45:03.966
Awe.

45:06.200 --> 45:08.266
Would you like to
show Max how it's done?

45:08.268 --> 45:09.770
Sure, of course.

45:20.743 --> 45:21.810
Huh?

45:21.812 --> 45:25.079
You see, he was only
thinking of himself, too.

45:25.081 --> 45:27.813
Awe, I'm afraid I
woke up with my paws

45:27.815 --> 45:31.150
on the wrong side of
the bed this morning.

45:34.755 --> 45:36.753
That disapperious thing,

45:36.755 --> 45:38.855
you think I'll learn
how to do it by Easter?

45:38.857 --> 45:41.858
If not, just do it
next year, with me.

45:41.860 --> 45:42.892
No can do.

45:42.894 --> 45:46.128
By Easter Sunday, I
definitely gotta be back.

45:46.130 --> 45:47.861
But why is that?

45:47.863 --> 45:52.766
Because I can join this
awesome wicked gang, you know.

45:52.768 --> 45:55.135
And what is that, a gang?

45:55.137 --> 45:57.870
It's really cool people who
do awesome stuff together,

45:57.872 --> 46:00.037
and they like way stick
up for each other.

46:00.039 --> 46:03.141
Ah, so you mean
like Easter rabbits.

46:03.143 --> 46:06.243
Well, ah, a bit
like that, yeah.

46:06.245 --> 46:08.244
Have you see
anything suspicious?

46:08.246 --> 46:09.812
No, all is quiet.

46:09.814 --> 46:11.913
But still, what's
the point of all this?

46:11.915 --> 46:13.147
There's just a few of us here,

46:13.149 --> 46:14.982
and we're supposed to
patrol this long hedge,

46:14.984 --> 46:16.450
it's ridiculous!

46:16.452 --> 46:18.919
That's the way we do
things here, young rabbit!

46:18.921 --> 46:22.154
Well, what would
you do differently?

46:22.156 --> 46:25.156
Well, I guess in the
city, we would, ah,

46:25.158 --> 46:26.825
we'd think of something.

46:26.827 --> 46:28.762
We would, we would...

46:30.864 --> 46:32.730
Hey, that's it!

46:32.732 --> 46:34.832
We could build an alarm system!

46:34.834 --> 46:36.365
- Huh?
- Huh?

46:36.367 --> 46:37.202
Mmm.

46:39.137 --> 46:42.040
This here is an
electric circuit.

46:43.905 --> 46:48.076
And if you close it, then...

46:49.844 --> 46:51.080
Pretty cool, huh?

46:52.345 --> 46:54.079
Now, all we have to
do is stretch a line

46:54.081 --> 46:56.880
through the whole hedge
that transmits the movement

46:56.882 --> 46:58.349
when someone tries to get in.

46:58.351 --> 46:59.419
Wow, great!

47:00.952 --> 47:04.152
Let me get some line, so
we can start right away.

47:04.154 --> 47:07.056
Now, what about
school rule number 10?

47:07.058 --> 47:08.756
Our training every morning.

47:08.758 --> 47:10.424
Learn the rules
so that you're aware

47:10.426 --> 47:12.159
of when you need to break them.

47:17.098 --> 47:18.701
Here, catch it!

47:19.867 --> 47:21.233
Got it!

47:21.235 --> 47:22.200
Over here!

47:22.202 --> 47:24.033
Help me with the ladder!

47:24.035 --> 47:26.270
Wait a second!

47:26.272 --> 47:27.107
I got it!

47:28.840 --> 47:32.877
Hmm,
moving along quite nicely.

47:35.011 --> 47:36.810
Here, Emmi, this is for you!

47:36.812 --> 47:37.881
Wait a sec.

47:41.116 --> 47:41.951
Oh no!

47:45.086 --> 47:45.921
Huh?

47:46.921 --> 47:47.855
Where is...

47:49.121 --> 47:50.287
Bingo!

47:50.289 --> 47:52.321
How can my glasses
be gone again?

47:52.323 --> 47:53.823
Huh?

47:57.161 --> 47:57.995
Ah.

47:59.196 --> 48:00.464
There they are.

48:01.899 --> 48:03.898
I think I might've been
wrong about you, Max.

48:03.900 --> 48:07.933
You just may turn into a
wonderful Easter rabbit.

48:07.935 --> 48:09.268
Thanks.

48:09.270 --> 48:11.870
Max, a great Easter rabbit?

48:11.872 --> 48:13.875
I've had enough of this.

48:18.478 --> 48:22.278
Hey, Max, could you help
me over there by the rocks?

48:22.280 --> 48:23.114
Me?

48:23.980 --> 48:25.149
Yeah, why not?

48:26.116 --> 48:27.582
You're not really going to...

48:27.584 --> 48:29.250
See to it that he
sprains his ankle?

48:29.252 --> 48:30.919
There's nothing wrong with that.

48:30.921 --> 48:31.751
Unless of course you're training

48:31.753 --> 48:34.923
for the Easter
Rabbit Examination.

48:40.927 --> 48:42.063
So, here we are.

48:49.867 --> 48:51.232
How long did you
have to practice

48:51.234 --> 48:53.268
the disapperious
in order to do it?

48:53.270 --> 48:54.936
You up top, I'll be here.

48:54.938 --> 48:55.939
Okie-doke.

48:56.840 --> 48:58.339
Huh?

48:58.341 --> 49:02.145
I absolutely have to get
that down before the, ahh!

49:04.211 --> 49:05.546
Heads up, Anton!

49:11.517 --> 49:13.852
Oh, boy, that was way close.

49:15.485 --> 49:16.320
Sorry.

49:19.589 --> 49:23.122
Everything alright?

49:23.124 --> 49:26.593
Of course, just a
silly little accident.

49:26.595 --> 49:28.096
Everything's fine.

49:30.031 --> 49:31.863
Thanks.

50:30.610 --> 50:34.076
Wow!

50:34.078 --> 50:35.581
That is so pretty.

50:37.247 --> 50:38.948
Could I also perhaps try it?

50:38.950 --> 50:39.951
Of course!

50:42.985 --> 50:44.988
Great, thanks!

50:52.392 --> 50:55.294
- Hey, Emmi, tell me.
- What's that?

50:58.031 --> 51:00.663
Have you ever
wished for something,

51:00.665 --> 51:03.065
and then all of a
sudden you weren't sure

51:03.067 --> 51:05.601
if you really wanted it?

51:05.603 --> 51:08.969
No, I always wanted
to be an Easter bunny,

51:08.971 --> 51:13.141
ever since when I saw the
golden egg the first time.

51:14.975 --> 51:15.611
Hmm.

51:20.680 --> 51:21.713
Everyone up!

51:21.715 --> 51:23.315
The foxes are here!

51:24.449 --> 51:26.016
You lard brain imbecile,

51:26.018 --> 51:27.716
you calculated the
wrong distance!

51:27.718 --> 51:29.021
Impossible.

51:30.655 --> 51:32.621
It was just the wrong lever, Ma.

51:32.623 --> 51:35.423
L is the one for Lorenz.

51:35.425 --> 51:36.723
I told you!

51:36.725 --> 51:39.659
Then why did Bruno get on it?

51:43.663 --> 51:45.964
They've built a catapult!

51:45.966 --> 51:50.334
Goodness, our hedge
wasn't made for that.

51:50.336 --> 51:51.337
Follow me!

51:53.571 --> 51:56.037
F, Mama, for Ferdinand.

51:56.039 --> 51:58.975
What do you
think I am, stupid?

52:01.011 --> 52:02.679
Ye-hah!

52:03.646 --> 52:07.179
Awe man, we're
not gonna make it.

52:07.181 --> 52:08.246
Yah!

52:08.248 --> 52:09.083
Ee, hi!

52:11.352 --> 52:13.250
First you have
to deal with me.

52:13.252 --> 52:14.618
You're not gonna
trick me again!

52:18.224 --> 52:21.123
Can I just eat at
least one little rabbit?

52:21.125 --> 52:22.591
- Just for like a...
- No way!

52:22.593 --> 52:26.362
You get me the golden
egg, that's all.

52:35.569 --> 52:37.569
Oh, dip stick!

52:37.571 --> 52:39.604
Hey, where
are you off to?

52:39.606 --> 52:40.441
Hello!

52:46.112 --> 52:47.046
One more.

52:52.382 --> 52:54.782
What are you
doin' there, get up!

52:54.784 --> 52:55.618
Huh!

53:06.794 --> 53:09.193
Anton, be careful!

53:09.195 --> 53:11.364
On the bed, Anton!

53:13.464 --> 53:14.299
Come on!

53:15.166 --> 53:16.001
Huh?

53:18.068 --> 53:19.800
Don't even dare
thinkin' about comin' back

53:19.802 --> 53:22.703
without that egg, get
on, help your brother!

53:24.807 --> 53:26.343
And now!

53:46.790 --> 53:49.089
Ugh, you
and your half witted plans!

53:49.091 --> 53:50.658
Ma',
the plan was great!

53:50.660 --> 53:52.392
If only Bruno hadn't
landed in the hedge,

53:52.394 --> 53:54.227
and set off the
alarm by doin' it.

53:54.229 --> 53:56.161
Don't back talk me!

53:56.163 --> 53:59.263
I can't do nothin'
with you all.

53:59.265 --> 54:00.731
Get
your butts home!

54:00.733 --> 54:01.765
I've had enough!

54:06.771 --> 54:08.707
- We did it!
- Awesome!

54:21.215 --> 54:22.282
Man!

54:22.284 --> 54:23.649
Hermine, there's no more smoke

54:23.651 --> 54:25.786
coming from the Fox's shack.

54:27.787 --> 54:31.822
Hmm, very strange, I think
I need to take a closer look.

54:31.824 --> 54:33.690
Oh, just calm down, Mama.

54:33.692 --> 54:34.657
No, I ain't!

54:34.659 --> 54:36.392
Where do we walk to anyway?

54:36.394 --> 54:37.626
Out of the forest!

54:37.628 --> 54:39.326
I don't ever wanna
see another rabbit.

54:39.328 --> 54:41.728
When they come hoppin'
around on Easter,

54:41.730 --> 54:44.698
I'm gonna come down
with a fox band worm.

54:44.700 --> 54:46.399
I need a vacation.

54:46.401 --> 54:49.135
Why do I always end
up carrying everything?

54:52.238 --> 54:53.073
Oh.

54:54.739 --> 54:55.574
What?

54:56.641 --> 54:59.775
The fox's have
departed, ha-ha!

54:59.777 --> 55:01.777
Which means Easter
can be enjoyed.

55:05.816 --> 55:07.415
See, told you so.

55:07.417 --> 55:09.616
I can handle those
trash eaters any day.

55:09.618 --> 55:11.383
Of course, you all alone.

55:11.385 --> 55:14.454
No, we did it by
working together.

55:14.456 --> 55:17.625
Wait, Emmi!

55:18.625 --> 55:19.760
- Oh, Max.
- Huh?

55:20.827 --> 55:22.627
I found this, by the way.

55:22.629 --> 55:24.795
I assume it belongs to you.

55:24.797 --> 55:26.832
Oh, yeah, thank you.

55:32.902 --> 55:36.736
Madam Hermine, if someone already
did a whole lot for Easter

55:36.738 --> 55:41.508
could maybe the disapperious
be left out of the examination?

55:41.510 --> 55:44.542
Mm-mm, but if his
heart is with us,

55:44.544 --> 55:47.713
he will also manage
the disapperious.

55:56.486 --> 55:58.788
Just to the window, come on.

56:21.172 --> 56:22.671
- Max!
- Huh?

56:22.673 --> 56:25.439
What are you doing here?

56:25.441 --> 56:28.743
I wanted to check and see
if maybe I've grown a bit.

56:28.745 --> 56:30.447
- Did you?
- Mm-mm.

56:33.481 --> 56:35.313
Try putting these on.

56:35.315 --> 56:37.782
- They make you a bit taller.
- Thank you!

56:37.784 --> 56:39.716
And what brings you
outside this late?

56:39.718 --> 56:42.786
What, you want to go?

56:42.788 --> 56:46.656
Well, yeah, the foxes are
gone, the forest is safe,

56:46.658 --> 56:48.591
and the disapperious
is a pipe dream.

56:48.593 --> 56:50.758
Then take the
examination next year.

56:50.760 --> 56:52.394
You belong here, Max.

56:52.396 --> 56:54.461
You've become one of us now.

56:54.463 --> 56:56.763
You've become an Easter rabbit.

56:56.765 --> 56:58.731
I'm a gang rabbit, Emmi.

56:58.733 --> 57:01.968
- But now, we are your gang.
- You don't get it, do you?

57:01.970 --> 57:04.735
Then explain it to me, please.

57:04.737 --> 57:06.870
A gang, that's like something

57:06.872 --> 57:09.740
way bigger than all this here.

57:09.742 --> 57:12.677
But...

57:19.549 --> 57:20.684
Goodbye, Emmi.

57:24.953 --> 57:25.787
Ow!

57:52.441 --> 57:54.806
Ah, the smell of the big city!

57:54.808 --> 57:57.242
There ain't nothin'
better than that!

58:11.621 --> 58:13.690
Finally, back home again.

58:21.963 --> 58:22.797
Ugh.

58:27.934 --> 58:29.566
Awe.

58:47.581 --> 58:48.680
He left?

58:48.682 --> 58:50.416
That doesn't make sense.

58:50.418 --> 58:53.384
I thought Max wanted
to be an Easter rabbit.

58:53.386 --> 58:57.053
One who rushes often
doesn't see the path.

58:57.055 --> 58:57.891
Ah...

58:58.790 --> 59:01.790
I wonder where our
examiner is, Willibald.

59:01.792 --> 59:03.624
He should've been
here awhile ago.

59:03.626 --> 59:05.294
Emmi, do me a favor
and check the,

59:05.296 --> 59:07.661
Emmi?

59:07.663 --> 59:08.497
Emmi?

59:09.831 --> 59:10.865
Emmi!

59:21.707 --> 59:22.708
Dumb bell.

59:27.544 --> 59:29.779
Hey, where's
my airplane at?

59:29.781 --> 59:31.979
Yo, dude, we thought
you were like extinct.

59:31.981 --> 59:33.414
Max!

59:33.416 --> 59:34.815
Yo, did someone
snatch your kicks?

59:34.817 --> 59:35.848
Where were you all this time?

59:35.850 --> 59:37.817
- You don't wanna know.
- That bad?

59:37.819 --> 59:39.017
Yo, badder.

59:39.019 --> 59:41.486
In the meantime, we found out
what you're gonna have to do

59:41.488 --> 59:43.355
tomorrow to impress
the Shockwave Rabbits.

59:43.357 --> 59:44.589
Really.

59:44.591 --> 59:45.790
You gotta loot
the Easter baskets

59:45.792 --> 59:46.890
on the square in
front of City Hall.

59:46.892 --> 59:49.392
Whoever steals the most
eggs and goodies is in!

59:49.394 --> 59:50.793
Piece of cake for you, right.

59:50.795 --> 59:51.797
Si, claro!

59:55.066 --> 59:56.865
Where did you get this?

59:56.867 --> 01:00:00.001
Trade, this morning,
it was wicked spooky.

01:00:00.003 --> 01:00:02.835
A full freaky old fox
mother with her sons,

01:00:02.837 --> 01:00:04.638
but they like totally
went bat crazy

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.038
when they saw a rabbit costume.

01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:07.439
Rabbit costume?

01:00:07.441 --> 01:00:08.608
Yeah, one of the
bros like tried it on,

01:00:08.610 --> 01:00:11.009
and then they went whistlin'
dixie back to the forest.

01:00:11.011 --> 01:00:12.444
To the forest?

01:00:12.446 --> 01:00:15.044
- Oh, sweet carrot!
- Sweet carrot?

01:00:15.046 --> 01:00:17.847
The Rabbit School
is in danger!

01:00:17.849 --> 01:00:19.815
Rabbit School?

01:00:19.817 --> 01:00:22.351
What's up with him?

01:00:24.354 --> 01:00:25.854
Wow, where'd he learn that?

01:00:25.856 --> 01:00:26.786
Cool.

01:00:34.795 --> 01:00:36.394
Huh?

01:00:36.396 --> 01:00:38.495
We were expecting Willibald
to be the examiner.

01:00:38.497 --> 01:00:40.131
Yes, Willibald is sick.

01:00:40.133 --> 01:00:44.503
I'm his replacement, though
I'm a bit sick myself.

01:00:46.404 --> 01:00:49.772
Bit of a cold, Ferd,
Reinhart is my name,

01:00:49.774 --> 01:00:50.706
carrot's my game.

01:00:50.708 --> 01:00:52.874
Did you have a safe
journey, Reinhart?

01:00:52.876 --> 01:00:54.507
We've been having
quite a bit of trouble

01:00:54.509 --> 01:00:56.610
- with the foxes of late.
- Don't say.

01:00:56.612 --> 01:00:59.748
Then let me lock up
the gate right away.

01:01:01.015 --> 01:01:04.049
Then we can start straight away.

01:01:04.051 --> 01:01:06.083
Of course, of course.

01:01:06.085 --> 01:01:08.118
Everything is all set.

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:11.887
And you call yourself an
Easter bunny examiner, ha!

01:01:11.889 --> 01:01:13.155
We need a whole lot more.

01:01:13.157 --> 01:01:16.692
If you don't give gas, you're
gonna land in Mama Fox's stew!

01:01:16.694 --> 01:01:17.625
Help me!

01:01:17.627 --> 01:01:18.726
Shut your trap!

01:01:18.728 --> 01:01:20.862
Help, help!

01:01:20.864 --> 01:01:21.898
Huh?

01:01:29.804 --> 01:01:31.101
This here.

01:01:31.103 --> 01:01:33.804
Those belong to the evil fox.

01:01:37.476 --> 01:01:39.712
Yes, bravo, it's alright.

01:01:40.978 --> 01:01:43.745
Then let us move on to the
practical part of the exam.

01:01:43.747 --> 01:01:44.812
Huh?

01:01:51.720 --> 01:01:54.621
You're supposed
to be over there.

01:02:03.528 --> 01:02:06.562
Look at those
finger-lickin' rabbits.

01:02:06.564 --> 01:02:10.432
Ain't happenin',
gotta keep walkin'.

01:02:10.434 --> 01:02:11.765
You're doin' that on purpose

01:02:11.767 --> 01:02:14.835
to deny us our Easter baskets!

01:02:14.837 --> 01:02:16.737
Just you wait, let's
see how you work

01:02:16.739 --> 01:02:19.472
once I get my stew goin'.

01:02:24.744 --> 01:02:26.747
Open the dang dang door!

01:02:27.979 --> 01:02:32.115
I swear, I'm gonna make
a rabbit Ragu out of you!

01:02:32.117 --> 01:02:33.949
The foxes are in
the Rabbit School!

01:02:33.951 --> 01:02:35.783
- One of them is...
- Disguised as a rabbit.

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:37.618
I know, let's go, come on!

01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:39.753
Just a moment, okay!

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:41.889
Where is this supposed to be?

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:43.790
Ah, stupid map.

01:02:43.792 --> 01:02:46.524
I can't recognize nothin'.

01:02:46.526 --> 01:02:48.894
That's typical for Ferdin...

01:02:50.797 --> 01:02:52.029
Really?

01:02:52.031 --> 01:02:54.765
Wow, and that makes
a rabbit strong.

01:02:54.767 --> 01:02:57.234
We'll be puttin'
an end to that.

01:03:04.841 --> 01:03:05.475
Stop!

01:03:06.842 --> 01:03:09.844
The foxes, the foxes are here!

01:03:09.846 --> 01:03:12.044
But I'm in the middle
of my examination.

01:03:12.046 --> 01:03:14.847
One of them is dressed
up like a rabbit!

01:03:14.849 --> 01:03:17.749
- Examiner Reinhart?
- Huh?

01:03:17.751 --> 01:03:18.685
Over there!

01:03:20.919 --> 01:03:22.686
Things are going
according to plan, for once.

01:03:22.688 --> 01:03:24.119
Careful with that
egg, it's fragile.

01:03:24.121 --> 01:03:25.789
Now, let's go to Ma'!

01:03:25.791 --> 01:03:27.056
No, the golden egg!

01:03:27.058 --> 01:03:29.123
Don't worry, children!

01:03:30.994 --> 01:03:33.995
Careful it doesn't break!

01:03:33.997 --> 01:03:35.596
Not you again.

01:03:35.598 --> 01:03:37.063
Open up that gate right now!

01:03:37.065 --> 01:03:37.931
Never!

01:03:37.933 --> 01:03:39.098
Anton, catch!

01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:41.234
Get the key!

01:03:41.236 --> 01:03:43.738
You'll never get it!

01:03:47.205 --> 01:03:49.506
Now, I've reached my limit.

01:03:49.508 --> 01:03:50.907
It's rabbit season!

01:03:50.909 --> 01:03:52.909
It's rabbit season.

01:04:00.916 --> 01:04:02.052
Come to Bruno!

01:04:04.819 --> 01:04:08.989
Hey, Fatty, yu-hu!

01:04:10.124 --> 01:04:11.121
Run, run, run!

01:04:11.123 --> 01:04:13.056
Unbelievable.

01:04:16.794 --> 01:04:18.594
Here, Ernie!

01:04:19.898 --> 01:04:21.764
Phenomenal.

01:04:21.766 --> 01:04:23.832
Watch out, Ernie!

01:04:23.834 --> 01:04:25.866
Hey, fatso, behind you!

01:04:25.868 --> 01:04:28.204
Don't call me fat!

01:04:32.874 --> 01:04:33.573
- Wow!
- Emmi?

01:04:33.575 --> 01:04:35.943
- Yes!
- Let's go, come on!

01:04:37.811 --> 01:04:40.143
Alright, Emmi and I will
get 'em away from the gate,

01:04:40.145 --> 01:04:42.013
then you can bring
the egg to safety.

01:04:42.015 --> 01:04:44.213
Got it, and we'll take
care of the other two!

01:04:44.215 --> 01:04:46.848
- Whoops!
- Can't outfox me!

01:04:50.054 --> 01:04:53.491
Children, over here!

01:05:01.763 --> 01:05:04.829
Take that!

01:05:14.772 --> 01:05:15.904
It's me!

01:05:15.906 --> 01:05:17.839
You knuckle brain!

01:05:29.849 --> 01:05:31.282
♪ Foxes foxes they're so mean ♪

01:05:31.284 --> 01:05:33.217
♪ Selfish like
you've never seen ♪

01:05:33.219 --> 01:05:35.051
♪ All day long they eat... ♪

01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:44.295
And showtime!

01:05:46.896 --> 01:05:49.162
Try and aim for his head!

01:05:49.164 --> 01:05:50.964
I won't be outfoxed!

01:05:50.966 --> 01:05:52.765
Good shot!

01:05:52.767 --> 01:05:53.899
Let's go, now!

01:05:53.901 --> 01:05:56.635
Further right!

01:05:56.637 --> 01:05:57.269
Ow!

01:05:57.271 --> 01:05:58.134
Yes!

01:05:58.136 --> 01:05:59.370
Bullseye!

01:05:59.372 --> 01:06:01.739
Carefully now,
everyone together.

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:08.610
Let's get out of here, now!

01:06:08.612 --> 01:06:10.278
You, you floppy eared beasts!

01:06:10.280 --> 01:06:13.381
To the training course, Emmi!

01:06:13.383 --> 01:06:14.213
Emmi?

01:06:14.215 --> 01:06:16.051
She's not on the list.

01:06:17.819 --> 01:06:19.952
Watch out, Emmi!

01:06:19.954 --> 01:06:20.789
Whoa!

01:06:23.023 --> 01:06:25.222
Why, you puffy tailed bum!

01:06:25.224 --> 01:06:26.890
- Gotcha!
- Help!

01:06:26.892 --> 01:06:27.961
Max, help me!

01:06:30.394 --> 01:06:31.931
Help, Max, help!

01:06:44.373 --> 01:06:45.207
Ha-ha!

01:06:48.776 --> 01:06:51.275
Looks like some
freshly pressed foxtail.

01:06:51.277 --> 01:06:53.645
Ferdinand, wake up!

01:06:53.647 --> 01:06:54.778
They got our egg!

01:06:54.780 --> 01:06:56.879
Huh?

01:07:01.418 --> 01:07:02.817
Give us the golden egg!

01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:04.919
Then you can have
your runt back again.

01:07:04.921 --> 01:07:06.255
No way, never!

01:07:07.889 --> 01:07:08.924
Awe.

01:07:10.091 --> 01:07:11.960
Give them the egg.

01:07:15.695 --> 01:07:19.865
Thank you, and now why
don't you open that gate?

01:07:21.933 --> 01:07:23.800
I'll do it!

01:07:23.802 --> 01:07:25.367
Give me the key, sir.

01:07:25.369 --> 01:07:26.203
Move it.

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:40.011
Come on, give me the key!

01:07:40.013 --> 01:07:42.882
Not until you let go of Ernie!

01:07:45.217 --> 01:07:47.953
Alright, then
at the same time.

01:07:49.987 --> 01:07:51.222
- Emmi!
- Ernie!

01:07:58.894 --> 01:08:01.028
Ma' will be proud of us.

01:08:04.833 --> 01:08:06.097
The egg!

01:08:06.099 --> 01:08:07.034
No, no, no!

01:08:08.234 --> 01:08:10.101
The egg,
it's gonna break!

01:08:22.912 --> 01:08:23.947
No!

01:08:26.982 --> 01:08:27.817
Ow! Rrr!

01:08:29.984 --> 01:08:31.082
Max?

01:08:31.085 --> 01:08:32.919
Max?

01:08:32.921 --> 01:08:36.487
Thank goodness, I thought
I was in rabbit heaven again.

01:08:36.488 --> 01:08:38.988
Yeah, right, rabbit heaven.

01:08:38.991 --> 01:08:40.857
It was way crazy here!

01:08:40.859 --> 01:08:42.926
Unbelievable, you scored
at least 30 earlongs!

01:08:42.928 --> 01:08:44.761
That's never been done before.

01:08:47.798 --> 01:08:49.000
Good job!

01:08:56.037 --> 01:08:58.803
I guess you guys won.

01:08:58.805 --> 01:09:02.106
You all are a really great team.

01:09:04.877 --> 01:09:08.010
Yay, Max saves the day!

01:09:31.229 --> 01:09:33.330
Just a moment,
someone's missing.

01:09:33.332 --> 01:09:35.029
Emmi, come here.

01:09:38.236 --> 01:09:41.337
- Congratulations, Emmi.
- Thank you!

01:09:41.339 --> 01:09:42.173
Here.

01:09:47.243 --> 01:09:48.942
Yay, Emmi!

01:09:48.944 --> 01:09:51.810
Oh, I say, don't any of our
old rules apply around here?

01:09:51.813 --> 01:09:54.445
Of course, rule number
one, and it is wicked cool,

01:09:54.447 --> 01:09:56.148
together we're a rockin' team,

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:58.047
and Easter will
be a turbo dream!

01:10:15.563 --> 01:10:19.331
Oh, awesome, the
Easter bunny was here!

01:10:19.333 --> 01:10:20.899
What'd you get?

01:10:22.402 --> 01:10:24.134
It's so pretty.

01:10:28.974 --> 01:10:30.840
The Easter rabbit was here.

01:10:30.842 --> 01:10:32.975
Cool, dude.

01:10:32.977 --> 01:10:36.010
Hey, find your
own basket, man.

01:10:36.012 --> 01:10:37.944
We hid enough for everyone.

01:10:37.946 --> 01:10:39.546
I must be flipping.

01:10:39.548 --> 01:10:41.947
- You haven't become a...
- An Easter rabbit?

01:10:41.949 --> 01:10:43.215
Correctimundo!

01:10:43.217 --> 01:10:44.918
You know, being
an Easter bunny

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:46.552
is the coolest
thing in the world.

01:10:46.554 --> 01:10:48.587
If you guys wanna
be one, let me know.

01:10:48.589 --> 01:10:49.521
I can get you in.

01:10:49.523 --> 01:10:51.855
Now, let's torpedo
the Shockwave Rabbits

01:10:51.857 --> 01:10:54.491
when they steal the eggs.

01:10:54.493 --> 01:10:57.460
An Easter rabbit,
I can't believe it.

01:11:00.997 --> 01:11:03.298
Rule 1B, egg snatchers
don't stand a chance

01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:05.932
when it's us they're up against.

01:11:05.934 --> 01:11:06.936
