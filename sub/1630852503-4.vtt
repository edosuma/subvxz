<i>Previously on</i> Good Sam...

00:06.606 --> 00:08.441
{\an1}You were shot
six months ago.

00:08.508 --> 00:09.709
VIVIAN:
<i>You have to be proctored.</i>

00:09.776 --> 00:10.543
I'll supervise him.

00:10.610 --> 00:11.411
I spoke with the board.

00:11.478 --> 00:13.213
{\an3}They're not just
gonna hand you the reins

00:13.279 --> 00:15.215
at the end of this.
They're gonna choose between us.

00:15.281 --> 00:17.250
Chairman of the Board
Byron Kingsley.

00:17.317 --> 00:19.285
{\an3}Thank you again for considering
me for the position.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.354
BYRON:
<i>You seem to have a...</i>

00:21.421 --> 00:23.523
{\an4}personal relationship
with Sam Griffith.

00:21.421 --> 00:23.523
I do.

00:23.590 --> 00:26.526
{\an1}I don't like her pulling you
into her family power struggle.

00:26.593 --> 00:28.361
You always made me laugh
so much.

00:28.428 --> 00:30.296
I still could.

00:31.398 --> 00:33.500
(groans)
You had to call Rhonda?

00:33.566 --> 00:35.368
{\an1}She is the chief
of plastics.

00:35.435 --> 00:38.171
He resents my seniority.
Always has.

00:38.238 --> 00:41.274
{\an1}You let Lakeshore lose
an eight-figure donation?

00:41.341 --> 00:42.542
And pinned it on me.

00:42.609 --> 00:45.145
{\an1}I did tell you
that the lesson was gonna hurt.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.379
Tell me how to hit him.

00:46.446 --> 00:48.348
My help comes with a price.

00:50.450 --> 00:52.419
Why would my dad keep

00:52.485 --> 00:54.287
{\an5}a bovine heart specimen?

00:52.485 --> 00:54.287
{\an1}(scoffs)

00:54.354 --> 00:57.390
No idea. His stuff was moved
down here when you took over.

00:57.457 --> 01:00.260
All his files
and furniture.

01:00.326 --> 01:01.728
{\an5}Whatever that is.

01:00.326 --> 01:01.728
Oh.

01:01.795 --> 01:04.197
{\an1}Amphibian hearts
only have three chambers.

01:04.263 --> 01:05.397
{\an1}They diffuse oxygen
through their skin...

01:05.465 --> 01:06.499
We're not here
for frog talk.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.234
{\an1}Can you help me
move this, please?

01:08.301 --> 01:09.302
Yeah.

01:10.603 --> 01:13.339
{\an5}(grunts)

01:10.603 --> 01:13.339
Rhonda, what exactly
are we looking for?

01:14.574 --> 01:16.276
Donor records. Hmm?

01:16.342 --> 01:18.211
You want the chief position?

01:18.278 --> 01:20.213
{\an3}Revenge for your father
costing you that ten million?

01:20.280 --> 01:21.281
Here's what you do.

01:22.649 --> 01:24.417
You win over his biggest donor.

01:24.484 --> 01:26.286
You find the head of the snake.

01:26.352 --> 01:27.654
You woo 'em to your side,

01:27.720 --> 01:29.355
{\an3}I guarantee you,
the rest will follow.

01:29.422 --> 01:31.724
So, what, I'm supposed
to cold-call these people

01:31.791 --> 01:33.426
and ask them
for financial support?

01:33.493 --> 01:34.661
Mm, it's not quite that easy.

01:34.727 --> 01:36.663
You got to find them first.

01:36.729 --> 01:39.666
Sure, Waxman had his name on the
wall, but he was the exception.

01:39.732 --> 01:42.435
{\an3}Your father had
more anonymous donors

01:42.502 --> 01:43.570
than any other department.

01:43.636 --> 01:44.737
So?

01:44.804 --> 01:46.739
(chuckles):
So?

01:46.806 --> 01:48.741
Donors like attention.

01:48.808 --> 01:51.711
That's why we name all these
walls and wings after them.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.646
{\an3}That much anonymous
money coming Griff's way

01:53.713 --> 01:55.315
tells me something's up.

01:55.381 --> 01:56.516
"Something's up"?

01:56.583 --> 01:57.650
That's your theory?

01:57.717 --> 01:59.419
Call it more of a hunch.

02:00.520 --> 02:02.288
MALCOLM:
<i>So she actually said</i>

02:02.355 --> 02:03.456
"head of the snake"?

02:03.523 --> 02:05.258
{\an1}(chuckles):
She's not subtle.

02:05.325 --> 02:07.260
(chuckles)

02:07.327 --> 02:09.195
You find anything down there?

02:09.262 --> 02:10.797
Just my dad's address book.

02:10.864 --> 02:13.399
If I were to give you a name,

02:13.466 --> 02:15.602
could you tell me if it links
to a hospital donation?

02:15.668 --> 02:17.470
{\an1}I'm sorry.

02:17.537 --> 02:18.738
I'm so sorry. I'm...

02:18.805 --> 02:20.607
{\an5}Just forget I asked.

02:18.805 --> 02:20.607
{\an3}Sam,

02:20.673 --> 02:22.809
I can track a donor for you.

02:22.876 --> 02:24.711
Are you sure?

02:24.777 --> 02:26.746
Yes.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.281
{\an5}Okay.

02:26.813 --> 02:28.281
{\an3}(chuckles)

02:28.348 --> 02:30.250
So, in 2009,

02:30.316 --> 02:31.784
{\an5}anonymous donations
to my department...

02:30.316 --> 02:31.784
(exhales)

02:31.851 --> 02:33.186
{\an1}...shot
through the roof.

02:33.253 --> 02:34.354
That same year,

02:34.420 --> 02:35.922
my dad supervised
a clinical trial

02:35.989 --> 02:37.690
{\an1}for Fletcher
Pharmaceuticals. Now,

02:37.757 --> 02:40.460
{\an6}the company's owner is
this woman, Helen Fletcher.

02:37.757 --> 02:40.460
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

02:40.527 --> 02:43.162
{\an1}And she's in my dad's
address book and...

02:43.229 --> 02:45.632
all over his calendar.

02:45.698 --> 02:47.534
And look at this.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.269
She's worth billions.

02:49.335 --> 02:51.404
Here, let me see?

02:51.471 --> 02:53.473
{\an5}Helen Fletcher.

02:51.471 --> 02:53.473
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

02:53.540 --> 02:55.742
{\an5}(sighs)

02:53.540 --> 02:55.742
{\an3}I will see
what I can find.

02:56.809 --> 02:58.511
Thank you.

02:58.578 --> 03:00.179
(chuckles softly)

03:00.246 --> 03:01.481
This is a nice pen.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.249
{\an3}SAM:
Hmm.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.253
MALCOLM:
"CT." I am...

03:07.320 --> 03:09.188
going to assume that's
"cardiothoracic"?

03:09.255 --> 03:11.491
Caleb Tucker, actually.

03:13.493 --> 03:15.194
You know we used to date?

03:15.261 --> 03:17.297
I do now.

03:18.531 --> 03:20.700
Oh, mm-hmm.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.702
Med school, huh?

03:22.769 --> 03:24.437
It's where we met.

03:24.504 --> 03:25.705
And you dated the whole time?

03:25.772 --> 03:27.674
No, we were...

03:27.740 --> 03:30.209
on and off for a couple years.

03:30.276 --> 03:31.444
Y-Years?

03:31.511 --> 03:33.446
{\an3}Re-- Okay.

03:33.513 --> 03:35.315
It's not...

03:35.381 --> 03:36.649
{\an3}Hmm.

03:37.817 --> 03:39.586
What are you doing?

03:39.652 --> 03:41.321
I just don't want to be holding

03:41.387 --> 03:43.222
another man's pen in your bed.

03:43.289 --> 03:44.791
Oh.

03:43.289 --> 03:44.791
{\an3}Hmm?

03:44.857 --> 03:47.493
But whatever will I write with?

03:48.661 --> 03:50.997
If you want a pen...

03:51.064 --> 03:52.799
I got one for you.

03:52.865 --> 03:55.535
{\an5}Oh, really?

03:52.865 --> 03:55.535
Yes, yes.

03:55.602 --> 03:57.770
It is time to take some notes.

04:03.343 --> 04:04.510
{\an3}Why aren't you
answering my calls?

04:04.577 --> 04:05.812
Because I don't want
to talk to you.

04:05.878 --> 04:07.580
My badge won't open
the parking garage.

04:07.647 --> 04:09.716
{\an5}It's kind of...

04:07.647 --> 04:09.716
{\an1}Oh, my God,
talk to security.

04:09.782 --> 04:11.751
A call from you would be
so much more meaningful.

04:11.818 --> 04:13.753
I don't help people
who hurt my daughter.

04:13.820 --> 04:15.622
That was not my intention.

04:15.688 --> 04:18.358
{\an1}This is her reputation,
Griff.

04:18.423 --> 04:20.760
Everyone knows
about that donation she lost.

04:20.827 --> 04:24.731
What they don't know is
you tricked her into losing it.

04:24.797 --> 04:27.634
I didn't start this war.

04:27.700 --> 04:29.569
Well, you need to finish it.

04:29.636 --> 04:32.338

Donna gives us a heads-up.

04:39.312 --> 04:40.546

{\an3}take a hit,

07:42.795 --> 07:44.831
{\an8}What message is that?

07:44.897 --> 07:46.833
{\an7}Tell her I have an urgent matter
to discuss with her,

07:46.899 --> 07:48.534
{\an8}and if she could
please stop being

07:48.601 --> 07:50.469
{\an8}so dramatic and unreasonable

07:50.536 --> 07:51.971
{\an8}and answer my calls.

07:52.038 --> 07:54.640
{\an9}Sorry, Dr. Katz,
wrong number.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.844
{\an7}Trauma patient's injuries
will heal over time.

07:57.910 --> 07:59.779
{\an8}And Dr. Glass
will spearhead

07:59.846 --> 08:01.714
{\an9}the reattachment surgery
once the arm lands.

08:01.781 --> 08:04.684
{\an7}Plastics-- it's not all
eye lifts and implants, baby.

08:04.750 --> 08:06.886
{\an8}It's a big surgery
and she is asking

08:06.953 --> 08:08.721
{\an8}for residents to assist.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.690
{\an7}Me.

08:08.788 --> 08:10.690
{\an8}Oh, no, no,
no, I've never been

08:10.756 --> 08:12.692
{\an8}in one of those before.

08:10.756 --> 08:12.692
{\an8}Yeah, 'cause they never
happen-- can I go?

08:12.758 --> 08:14.660
{\an8}I got it. One of me is
worth two of them.

08:14.727 --> 08:15.528
{\an8}Relax, the three of you will go.

08:15.595 --> 08:17.063
{\an9}And Dr. Glass will
choose who she wants

08:17.129 --> 08:18.965
{\an8}to be her primary.

08:19.031 --> 08:21.500
{\an8}What are you doing?

08:21.567 --> 08:23.836
{\an8}(stammers)
I might ask you the same thing.

08:23.903 --> 08:26.005
{\an8}You're on the arm.

08:26.072 --> 08:28.074
{\an8}With Rhonda? Come on.

08:28.140 --> 08:31.677
{\an8}Why don't I help Dr. Shah
prepare his lawsuit?

08:31.744 --> 08:32.812
{\an8}He needs me more.

08:32.879 --> 08:34.580
{\an8}I do?

08:34.647 --> 08:36.849
{\an8}Arm reattachment, go.

08:38.818 --> 08:41.621
{\an8}(coughing, wheezing)

08:41.687 --> 08:42.822
{\an7}You're having
trouble breathing, Noah?

08:42.889 --> 08:44.624
{\an8}Yeah, it's getting worse.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.725
{\an8}I hear crackling.

08:45.791 --> 08:48.828
{\an8}Which means that you likely have
fluid on your lungs.

08:48.895 --> 08:49.996
{\an9}Your chart says you've
been diagnosed

08:50.062 --> 08:51.063
{\an8}with congestive heart failure?

08:51.130 --> 08:52.732
{\an9}He's also a stubborn
ass, put that

08:52.798 --> 08:54.734
{\an8}in his chart. I'm his brother,

08:54.800 --> 08:56.802
{\an9}I should know.
He can't get up the stairs.

08:56.869 --> 08:58.537
{\an7}Listen, it's just
a little hard to breathe.

08:58.604 --> 09:00.806
{\an8}All right? That's all.

08:58.604 --> 09:00.806
{\an8}He's sick as a dog.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.075
{\an8}And still working on that farm
that we should've sold

09:03.142 --> 09:05.978
{\an7}years ago.

09:03.142 --> 09:05.978
{\an9}Look, our pops
worked that land

09:06.045 --> 09:07.914
{\an8}well into his 80s.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.914
{\an8}And he'd be
the first one to say

09:07.980 --> 09:10.049
{\an8}that soybeans aren't worth
dying over.

09:10.116 --> 09:12.652
{\an8}Rash on the lower extremities.

09:12.718 --> 09:15.087
{\an8}Swollen joints. Are you in pain?

09:15.154 --> 09:16.822
{\an8}(coughing, wheezing)

09:16.889 --> 09:18.791
{\an8}(scoffs) He's always in pain.

09:18.858 --> 09:20.760
{\an8}His legs go numb some days.

09:20.826 --> 09:22.695
{\an8}Just tell them.

09:22.762 --> 09:24.664
{\an8}Look, it's-it's
the breathing I need help with.

09:24.730 --> 09:25.865
{\an8}And that's all.

09:25.932 --> 09:27.733
{\an8}Let's order a chest X-ray,

09:27.800 --> 09:29.068
{\an8}and then we're gonna
get you on a diuretic

09:29.135 --> 09:30.736
{\an7}to take this fluid
off your lungs.

09:30.803 --> 09:32.805
{\an8}Yeah. That's what
they usually do.

09:32.872 --> 09:34.707
{\an8}"Usually"?

09:34.774 --> 09:36.842
{\an7}How many times have you been
to the hospital for this?

09:36.909 --> 09:38.778
{\an8}CALEB:
<i>Six times in six months?</i>

09:38.844 --> 09:41.080
{\an7}That is an unusually rapid
rate of decompensation.

09:41.147 --> 09:43.082
{\an9}Also, for someone
who's been here so much,

09:43.149 --> 09:44.750
{\an9}there's almost nothing
in his chart.

09:44.817 --> 09:46.953
{\an7}You would think someone
would've ordered a workup.

09:47.019 --> 09:48.120
{\an8}Maybe they sent him
to outpatient for follow-up?

09:48.187 --> 09:50.756
{\an8}Well, he clearly didn't go.

09:50.823 --> 09:51.991
{\an8}All right,
just put the order in.

09:52.058 --> 09:54.126
{\an7}Add an infectious disease
panel-- grain crops

09:54.193 --> 09:56.729
{\an8}can breed fungus
and blastomycosis would explain

09:56.796 --> 09:58.698
{\an8}the joint pain
and the rash.

09:58.764 --> 10:01.033
{\an8}And let me know when the labs
are back-- I'm going to lunch.

10:01.100 --> 10:03.035
{\an9}Wait, you don't go to lunch. You
barely stop to eat lunch here.

10:03.102 --> 10:05.104
{\an7}Well, today
I'm doing both.

10:06.906 --> 10:10.176
{\an3}So while Dr. Glass sutures
the radial artery,

10:10.242 --> 10:12.078
I'm going to be
holding down the fort

10:12.144 --> 10:13.879
with the median nerve

10:13.946 --> 10:15.748
right over here.

10:15.815 --> 10:17.850
Do I really need help
prepping for my lawsuit?

10:17.917 --> 10:20.886
{\an1}Nah, they always drop residents
out at the last minute.

10:20.953 --> 10:23.923
Is... that my trail mix?

10:23.990 --> 10:26.926
{\an1}No, it's communal,
but, um...

10:28.728 --> 10:30.229
{\an1}...you can have it anyway--
no chocolate left.

10:32.832 --> 10:34.066
You know Rhonda might not
pick you, right?

10:34.133 --> 10:35.801
(laughs)
Please.

10:35.868 --> 10:38.170
I was made for this.
I dream of severed limbs.

10:38.237 --> 10:40.639
Plus, I got there first.

10:40.706 --> 10:43.175
You got there first because you
have a man on the inside.

10:43.242 --> 10:45.711
{\an1}Oh, I thought
I detected a spark in the ER.

10:45.778 --> 10:47.246
Dr. Costa, you rake.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.015
You get his name?

10:49.081 --> 10:51.183
That handsome paramedic?

10:51.250 --> 10:53.052
My boyfriend's name is Tim.

10:53.119 --> 10:55.187
Hmm, boyfriend? Well...

10:55.254 --> 10:58.724
in fairness to me,
I was in a coma for six months.

10:58.791 --> 11:00.793
They've been together
for, like, five years.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.728
You might have noticed that
if you'd peeked your head

11:02.795 --> 11:04.797
out of your self-absorbed cave.

11:04.864 --> 11:06.732
Well, it's

11:06.799 --> 11:08.901
"talk to Griff like he's
a resident" day, apparently.

11:10.102 --> 11:12.238
I miss that.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.809
They found the arm
and the friend.

11:16.876 --> 11:18.077
{\an3}She was thrown
from the car

11:18.144 --> 11:19.945
into the woods,
probably killed instantly.

11:22.081 --> 11:23.783
All we can do is try and make

11:23.849 --> 11:26.152
this patient whole again.

11:28.821 --> 11:31.090
Thank you so much for
meeting with me today.

11:31.157 --> 11:32.892
I know you're very busy.

11:32.958 --> 11:34.293
{\an1}What I am
is confused.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.162
I agreed to have lunch
with Dr. Griffith,

11:36.228 --> 11:38.064
but you're not the one
that I know.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.698
How did you get

11:39.765 --> 11:41.267
my information?

11:41.333 --> 11:43.102
On a confidential list
of hospital donors.

11:43.169 --> 11:45.304
And why am I here?

11:45.371 --> 11:47.306
Because I think that
you and I could have

11:47.373 --> 11:49.275
a very productive partnership

11:49.341 --> 11:51.811
when I'm made permanent chief
of my department.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.913
{\an1}Permanent?
Your father said

11:53.979 --> 11:55.848
you were just a temp.

11:55.915 --> 11:58.918
The board has yet to make
their final decision.

11:58.984 --> 12:01.754
I assume you're looking
for financial support.

12:01.821 --> 12:03.956
Among other things, yes.

12:04.023 --> 12:06.158
My last donation to Lakeshore

12:06.225 --> 12:08.327
was seven million.
I'm willing to double that.

12:08.394 --> 12:11.130
I'm sorry, did you just say...

12:11.197 --> 12:12.998
14 million.

12:13.065 --> 12:16.001
But I need you to do something
for me in return.

12:16.068 --> 12:18.904
What could I do for you?

12:18.971 --> 12:21.941
Give up this pursuit
of your father's position.

12:23.909 --> 12:26.145
You're asking me to step aside?

12:26.212 --> 12:29.014
Let him resume
his role as chief,

12:29.081 --> 12:31.817
and the money's yours.

12:38.557 --> 12:41.961
{\an3}Hey, did you actually leave
the hospital for a meal?

12:42.027 --> 12:43.329
{\an1}Uh, it was
a working lunch.

12:43.395 --> 12:45.498
{\an1}One of Dad's donors
just made me

12:45.564 --> 12:47.099
a very weird offer.

12:47.166 --> 12:49.168
"Weird offer"?

12:50.469 --> 12:53.038
{\an1}What would you say
to someone who wanted

12:53.105 --> 12:55.141
to pay you not to do your job?

12:55.207 --> 12:57.309
If she's anonymous,
how'd you find her?

12:57.376 --> 12:59.278
It was Rhonda's idea, she's
got this whole theory that--

12:59.345 --> 13:01.280
Wait a minute,
Rhonda Glass?

13:01.347 --> 13:03.449
{\an3}Oh, Sam...

13:03.516 --> 13:05.284
be careful, that woman...

13:05.351 --> 13:07.153
can't be trusted.

13:07.219 --> 13:08.954
"Be careful"?

13:09.021 --> 13:10.422
My own father

13:10.489 --> 13:13.025
{\an1}is trying to take me
out right now.

13:13.092 --> 13:15.161
The hospital is talking about
the public embarrassment

13:15.227 --> 13:17.897
{\an5}that he set me up for.

13:15.227 --> 13:17.897
I'm just looking
out for you, Sam.

13:17.963 --> 13:19.331
Whatever your issue is
with Rhonda,

13:19.398 --> 13:21.500
I trust her
more than I trust Dad.

13:24.236 --> 13:28.040
{\an3}It's my first solo case with Sam
in forever today-- it's fate.

13:28.107 --> 13:29.341
{\an1}It's also
the rotation schedule.

13:29.408 --> 13:31.043
{\an3}They drove in
together today.

13:31.110 --> 13:33.245
Her and Malcolm.

13:33.312 --> 13:36.015
{\an3}The universe put us together
because I got to do something.

13:36.081 --> 13:38.284
{\an3}Before she's cleaning out
a dresser drawer for the guy.

13:38.350 --> 13:40.219
{\an1}She can give her drawers
to whomever she wants.

13:40.286 --> 13:41.487
{\an3}Hey...

13:41.554 --> 13:44.056
{\an3}we have too much history,
we're undeniable.

13:44.123 --> 13:45.424
I just got a find a
way to talk to her.

13:45.491 --> 13:47.493
{\an3}It's fate.

13:47.560 --> 13:49.295
It's the rotation schedule.

13:49.361 --> 13:51.197
(pager beeping)

13:51.263 --> 13:52.998
Noah!

13:53.065 --> 13:55.201
{\an3}CALEB: Chest X-ray showed
a large right-side effusion

13:55.267 --> 13:56.402
and his blood pressure
just shot up.

13:56.468 --> 13:57.937
Flash pulmonary edema.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.238
Let's get him on a nitro drip.

13:59.305 --> 14:01.273
Caleb, get me
a thoracentesis kit.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.542
{\an5}What's wrong with him?

14:01.340 --> 14:03.542
The diuretics aren't taking
the fluid

14:03.609 --> 14:05.144
off his lungs fast enough.
We're gonna have

14:05.211 --> 14:07.947
{\an5}to do it manually.

14:05.211 --> 14:07.947
(Noah coughing)

14:08.013 --> 14:09.949
Okay.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.417
18 gauge needle.

14:12.551 --> 14:14.119
Here we go.

14:14.186 --> 14:15.554
That's it.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.625
Almost there, Noah.

14:22.228 --> 14:23.562
Take a deep breath for me.

14:27.600 --> 14:29.568
Better?

14:29.635 --> 14:32.605
Okay. Okay.

14:35.074 --> 14:37.109
{\an4}SAM:
Diphenhydramine should've
reduced that rash.

14:37.176 --> 14:40.045
{\an1}He's a mixed bag with his CHF
and a fungal pneumonia.

14:40.112 --> 14:42.114
{\an3}Should we start him
on antifungals?

14:42.181 --> 14:44.083
Not until we have
his tests results.

14:44.149 --> 14:46.218
Antifungals can be cardiotoxic.
I can't risk it.

14:49.355 --> 14:51.223
Want to talk about it?

14:51.290 --> 14:52.524
What?

14:52.591 --> 14:55.327
{\an3}Whatever stress is
inspiring the piano hands.

14:55.394 --> 14:58.330
I'm guessing it's Griff-related.

15:01.166 --> 15:03.569
I just need his test results.

15:06.205 --> 15:08.507
How come I can still feel it?

15:08.574 --> 15:12.378
{\an3}Your nerve endings are still
sending signals to your brain.

15:12.444 --> 15:14.213
Phantom limb?

15:14.280 --> 15:15.381
Mm-hmm.

15:15.447 --> 15:17.316
I thought that was sci-fi.

15:17.383 --> 15:20.185
No, it's real.

15:22.087 --> 15:24.223
Where's Beth?

15:25.457 --> 15:27.393
No one told you?

15:27.459 --> 15:29.561
{\an1}ADRIANA:
Told me what?

15:33.599 --> 15:36.168
You've been through enough
and you're still here.

15:36.235 --> 15:38.404
So I know you can
handle the truth.

15:38.470 --> 15:41.473
{\an3}She did not survive
the crash.

15:43.542 --> 15:45.110
What?

15:45.177 --> 15:47.246
{\an1}LEX:
She's gone.

15:47.313 --> 15:49.048
{\an3}I'm sorry.

15:49.114 --> 15:51.183
{\an1}ADRIANA:
She can't be gone.

15:51.250 --> 15:53.218
{\an8}We were together.

15:53.285 --> 15:55.187
How can she be gone?

15:55.254 --> 15:57.122
I don't...

15:57.189 --> 15:58.724
(Adriana sobbing)

16:01.627 --> 16:03.462
She can't be...

16:03.529 --> 16:05.264
She can't be gone...

16:05.331 --> 16:08.600
{\an8}She can't be...
she can't be...

16:08.667 --> 16:10.336
{\an5}Hey.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.336
Hi.

16:10.402 --> 16:11.370
{\an1}Your mom have
anything to say

16:11.437 --> 16:13.205
{\an4}about this whole
Helen Fletcher thing?

16:11.437 --> 16:13.205
(groans)

16:13.272 --> 16:15.574
{\an3}Turns out she's not gonna be
a lot of help on this one.

16:15.641 --> 16:17.476
{\an3}But I'm gonna find out
what's behind that offer.

16:17.543 --> 16:19.611
Hey, did we get those labs yet?

16:19.678 --> 16:23.315
Not yet, but Bernie said
he'd put a rush on it

16:23.382 --> 16:25.351
{\an1}if we went to his stand-up
comedy show tonight.

16:25.417 --> 16:27.586
{\an5}"We"?

16:25.417 --> 16:27.586
I mean, if I'm going,
you're going.

16:27.653 --> 16:29.421
We have dinner plans tonight.

16:31.190 --> 16:32.524
That is true.

16:32.591 --> 16:34.159
Sorry.

16:34.226 --> 16:35.227
No problem.

16:35.294 --> 16:36.562
Have you two been

16:36.628 --> 16:38.097
officially introduced?

16:38.163 --> 16:39.631
Not formally,
but I know who you are.

16:39.698 --> 16:41.700
{\an3}Same.

16:43.435 --> 16:44.603
Why don't we go find Bernie?

16:44.670 --> 16:47.172
I need those labs.

16:47.239 --> 16:49.408
CALEB:
<i>Well, he really doesn't like me.</i>

16:49.475 --> 16:51.243
{\an5}What?

16:49.475 --> 16:51.243
{\an1}It's like, okay, we got it,
you have plans tonight.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.512
{\an5}He was just reminding me.

16:51.310 --> 16:53.512
Uh, he was reminding me.

16:53.579 --> 16:56.248
{\an1}Bernie! I'm looking forward
to tonight, bud.

16:56.315 --> 16:58.217
I don't have your results.

16:58.283 --> 16:59.318
Why not?

16:58.283 --> 16:59.318
What?

16:59.385 --> 17:00.319
The labs were never run.

17:00.386 --> 17:02.454
What...

17:02.521 --> 17:03.722
Where are...

17:03.789 --> 17:06.191
{\an1}Utilization review board
rejected the tests

17:06.258 --> 17:08.327
{\an1}as "exotic"
and "not clinically indicated"

17:08.394 --> 17:10.396
{\an5}for congestive heart failure.

17:08.394 --> 17:10.396
{\an3}"Exotic"?

17:10.462 --> 17:12.664
I ran this panel
on three other patients today

17:12.731 --> 17:14.665
and they all went through.

17:14.733 --> 17:17.269
Does Noah not have
health insurance?

17:19.238 --> 17:21.272
No.

17:21.339 --> 17:23.242
I had no idea he let
his insurance run out.

17:23.308 --> 17:25.310
{\an1}I mean, I knew
the farm in trouble, but...

17:25.377 --> 17:28.280
{\an3}We've made an appeal to
the financial review board.

17:28.347 --> 17:29.415
How long will that take?

17:29.481 --> 17:30.616
We don't know.

17:30.682 --> 17:32.551
If you don't help him,

17:32.618 --> 17:35.187
he's gonna follow our father's
footsteps right into the grave.

17:35.254 --> 17:37.756
{\an3}I'm not gonna
let that happen.

17:39.425 --> 17:41.360
(sighs)

17:42.494 --> 17:43.729
Noah doesn't meet
sepsis criteria.

17:43.796 --> 17:45.364
Mm, he does now.

17:45.431 --> 17:47.533
You're altering his data.

17:47.599 --> 17:49.435
Doctors buff charts
all the time.

17:49.501 --> 17:51.437
{\an3}Some doctors, sure, but
I've never seen you do it.

17:52.438 --> 17:55.307
{\an1}Those criteria exist
to protect hospital finances.

17:55.374 --> 17:57.576
Which took a hit because
of the donation that I lost.

17:57.643 --> 17:59.745
I am not gonna let Noah
suffer for my mistake.

18:04.249 --> 18:06.418
{\an3}I think you just need
to clear your head.

18:06.485 --> 18:08.487
The old-fashioned way.

18:08.554 --> 18:10.189
If you're talking
about the lake...

18:10.255 --> 18:11.490
Oh, I'm talking about the lake.

18:11.557 --> 18:13.592
(chuckles) I'd rather go
to Bernie's comedy show.

18:13.659 --> 18:16.462
{\an8}Besides, the last time
I checked, there's no lake

18:16.528 --> 18:19.565
{\an8}inside this hospital.

18:16.528 --> 18:19.565
{\an8}If I could find one...

18:19.631 --> 18:21.300
{\an9}are you in?

18:25.804 --> 18:28.340
Give it up, Griff!

18:28.407 --> 18:31.343
{\an5}It's important.

18:28.407 --> 18:31.343
{\an1}That thing you're feeling
is called

18:31.410 --> 18:33.312
{\an1}boundaries.
Get used to it!

18:34.780 --> 18:37.382
Sam was in the storage locker.

18:41.520 --> 18:43.355
She has my address book.

18:43.422 --> 18:45.424
And the only place she could've
got it is the storage locker.

18:45.491 --> 18:46.692
Rhonda.

18:46.758 --> 18:49.628
She's been helping Sam.

18:49.695 --> 18:51.463
We have to get down there.

18:51.530 --> 18:54.233
I just hope your address book
is the only thing she's found.

18:54.299 --> 18:55.634
SAM:
<i>I found something!</i>

18:55.701 --> 18:59.371
These are the results
of the Fletcher Pharmaceuticals

18:59.438 --> 19:01.773
clinical trial, and my dad's
signature is all over it.

19:01.840 --> 19:03.375
Yeah, I found one, too.

19:03.442 --> 19:04.843
Did they run multiple trials?

19:04.910 --> 19:07.479
{\an3}I don't know...
but even if they did,

19:07.546 --> 19:09.748
{\an3}it wouldn't explain Helen's
loyalty to my father.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.550
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

19:14.453 --> 19:16.355
{\an1}What?

19:16.421 --> 19:18.257
{\an3}Nothing.

19:18.323 --> 19:19.558
Okay, earlier with Caleb.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.426
{\an3}He thinks you
don't like him.

19:21.493 --> 19:22.461
{\an1}Oh, well, he probably shouldn't
have asked you out on a date

19:22.528 --> 19:25.297
{\an5}while I was standing there.

19:22.528 --> 19:25.297
That wasn't a date.

19:25.364 --> 19:27.566
{\an1}Oh, are you sure?
It kind of sounded like it.

19:27.633 --> 19:29.368
{\an6}Uh--

19:27.633 --> 19:29.368
Uh, hey, given your history.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.803
It's a work thing.

19:29.434 --> 19:31.803
{\an1}(laughs)

19:31.870 --> 19:35.407
All right, well,
do you want to go with him?

19:35.474 --> 19:37.676
Do I want to go
to Bernie's comedy show? No.

19:37.743 --> 19:40.379
But would it
be a problem if I did?

19:40.445 --> 19:42.614
{\an5}Oh, no, not for me.

19:40.445 --> 19:42.614
{\an3}Okay.

19:42.681 --> 19:45.517
Unless there is something there.

19:45.584 --> 19:47.286
There is nothing there.

19:47.352 --> 19:49.755
{\an1}All right, well,
then there's no problem.

19:49.821 --> 19:51.790
Okay.

19:49.821 --> 19:51.790
{\an1}Okay.

19:51.857 --> 19:53.859
(both chuckle)

19:53.926 --> 19:55.761
Well, uh...

19:57.429 --> 19:59.898
{\an5}Hey, wait, wait, whoa, hold on.

19:57.429 --> 19:59.898
{\an3}Hmm?

19:59.965 --> 20:02.701
{\an3}MALCOLM:
Look at this.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.536
Well, what is that?

20:05.604 --> 20:08.440
{\an1}These are the same trial
results, but they're different.

20:08.507 --> 20:09.708
Three test subjects suffering

20:09.775 --> 20:11.577
adverse side effects.

20:11.643 --> 20:13.712
This report lists them
and this one doesn't.

20:13.779 --> 20:15.714
(stammers)

20:15.781 --> 20:18.550
This is the report
that they sent to the FDA.

20:18.617 --> 20:20.819
They scrubbed it.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.921
Helen Fletcher is
so loyal to my father

20:22.988 --> 20:25.390
because he doctored
the results of her drug trial.

20:29.394 --> 20:31.229
My father conducted
a clinical trial

20:31.296 --> 20:33.565
{\an3}and then altered the results
of the FDA report.

20:33.632 --> 20:35.334
He omitted three reports

20:35.400 --> 20:37.002
of serious side effects--

20:37.069 --> 20:39.338
heart murmurs, palpitations,
intermittent arrhythmias--

20:39.404 --> 20:41.740
because he knew
that those side effects

20:41.807 --> 20:43.442
{\an3}would mean a required
warning label.

20:43.508 --> 20:45.310
Which can mean billions
in lost revenue.

20:45.377 --> 20:47.279
He buried evidence,
and Helen compensates

20:47.346 --> 20:49.481
{\an5}him with donations
to this hospital.
Sam?

20:49.548 --> 20:51.350
{\an1}The trial was
over a decade ago.

20:51.416 --> 20:52.751
The drug's not even

20:52.818 --> 20:54.820
on the market anymore,
no lawsuits were filed.

20:54.886 --> 20:58.290
Anybody we take this to, they're
gonna want more evidence.

20:58.357 --> 21:00.359
Like the testimony of
the three people in the trial.

21:00.425 --> 21:03.328
{\an4}Well...

21:00.425 --> 21:03.328
Except all the participants
were anonymous.

21:03.395 --> 21:04.630
Yes
but you found Helen Fletcher.

21:04.696 --> 21:07.499
All right? If you can find her,
you can find the rest of them.

21:07.566 --> 21:09.768
Blastomycosis is a no-- whoops!

21:09.835 --> 21:11.036
I thought you were alone.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.038
{\an5}You got the labs?

21:11.103 --> 21:13.038
It's not a fungus.

21:13.105 --> 21:14.673
{\an3}But his RPR test
is positive.

21:14.740 --> 21:16.642
{\an5}Syphilis?

21:14.740 --> 21:16.642
It could've been dormant

21:16.708 --> 21:18.744
for years, and it can
lead to heart failure.

21:18.810 --> 21:20.779
{\an3}We have to get him on targeted
antibiotics right away.

21:20.846 --> 21:23.448
I have to-- okay.

21:24.583 --> 21:25.817
Hey.

21:27.452 --> 21:29.454
Nothing there.

21:30.622 --> 21:32.524
{\an5}(door closes)

21:30.622 --> 21:32.524
(Malcolm chuckles softly)

21:32.591 --> 21:35.293
{\an5}ISAN:
<i>I looked into it</i>
<i>and if Lakeshore settles,</i>

21:35.360 --> 21:37.396
{\an1}it's like saying
I'm guilty.

21:37.462 --> 21:40.399
{\an1}I'm not guilty.
That's way too harsh.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.801
{\an1}And...
Are you even listening?

21:42.868 --> 21:44.536
I'm studying for
the arm surgery.

21:45.871 --> 21:47.506
{\an3}What?

21:47.572 --> 21:49.708
{\an3}Who takes meetings
in the lounge?

21:49.775 --> 21:52.077
{\an3}I'm feeling a little
exposed here.

21:52.144 --> 21:53.612
I've covered our tracks.

21:53.679 --> 21:54.780
Tell that to your daughter.

21:54.846 --> 21:56.815
She found me.

21:56.882 --> 21:59.084
Took me to lunch,
and informed me

21:59.151 --> 22:00.585
{\an3}she's going
for your job.

22:00.652 --> 22:02.421
Well, that was... she...

22:02.487 --> 22:04.489
she should not have done that.

22:05.323 --> 22:07.559
{\an3}I'm launching two new
drugs next quarter.

22:07.626 --> 22:09.895
A scandal right before a rollout

22:09.961 --> 22:11.897
{\an5}is a PR nightmare.

22:09.961 --> 22:11.897
I understand.

22:11.963 --> 22:14.633
But that drug trial is
ancient history.

22:14.700 --> 22:17.602
It could still sink me
if it got out.

22:17.669 --> 22:20.372
Don't worry,
I'll be chief again very soon.

22:20.439 --> 22:21.673
Get your daughter

22:21.740 --> 22:24.509
under control, Robert.

22:26.511 --> 22:27.746
There's, like,
a million lawyers online

22:27.813 --> 22:29.614
who help doctors fight
malpractice suits.

22:29.681 --> 22:32.751
{\an5}Quiz me. Come on, ask me

22:29.681 --> 22:32.751
Dude, read the room.

22:32.818 --> 22:34.519
{\an3}what innervates the bicep.
The C5 and C6 fibers

22:34.586 --> 22:36.621
{\an3}of the musculocutaneous
nerve-- nailed it.

22:36.688 --> 22:38.123
{\an1}You're literally
quizzing yourself.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.425
And winning.

22:40.492 --> 22:43.462
{\an1}Can you stop angling
for the surgery for one second?

22:43.528 --> 22:45.664
That patient lost
her best friend.

22:45.731 --> 22:48.734
{\an3}And her arm, and I can only help
her with one of those things.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.737
{\an1}I guess you'd have
to have friends to imagine

22:51.803 --> 22:53.505
{\an1}what it would be like
to lose one.

22:53.572 --> 22:54.906
I have friends.

22:54.973 --> 22:57.509
{\an3}(scoffs) I have
many friends.

22:57.576 --> 22:59.611
Hi, friends.

22:59.678 --> 23:01.513
They didn't hear me.

23:07.552 --> 23:10.489
I understand you've been
reaching out to my donors.

23:10.555 --> 23:12.758
They might not be "yours"
for much longer.

23:12.824 --> 23:15.627
Does that mean you're
gonna take Helen's offer?

23:15.694 --> 23:18.396
It might even be good
for Lakeshore.

23:18.463 --> 23:21.166
I found everything, Dad.

23:21.233 --> 23:23.902
"Everything"?

23:23.969 --> 23:26.772
The drug trial that you altered
for Fletcher Pharmaceuticals.

23:29.808 --> 23:31.877
Your patient.

23:31.943 --> 23:33.879
The one with no insurance.

23:33.945 --> 23:36.581
Is there any chance that
you got those labs approved

23:36.648 --> 23:38.717
by doing a little data tampering
yourself?

23:38.784 --> 23:40.886
(laughs)
I helped a patient

23:40.952 --> 23:43.488
at the mercy of a broken system.

23:43.555 --> 23:45.190
You helped a billionaire
the system is set up to favor.

23:45.257 --> 23:47.793
So spare me
the false equivalency.

23:48.927 --> 23:51.763
You don't have
the stomach for this, Sam.

23:51.830 --> 23:53.465
Just take Helen's

23:53.532 --> 23:55.801
offer and let me
handle the money.

23:55.867 --> 23:57.736
(pager beeping)

24:01.006 --> 24:03.508
{\an5}(monitor beeping)

24:01.006 --> 24:03.508
I'm here! What's wrong?

24:03.575 --> 24:04.576
{\an5}He's going
into cardiogenic shock.

24:03.575 --> 24:04.576
{\an1}What?

24:04.643 --> 24:06.745
Increase his nitro drip
and add another pressor!

24:06.812 --> 24:08.914
Why is he getting worse?

24:10.015 --> 24:12.017
Remove the damaged tissue.

24:12.083 --> 24:15.554
{\an5}Rejoin the bone ends, repair...

24:12.083 --> 24:15.554
The muscles.

24:15.620 --> 24:17.589
{\an5}What is this, surgical Mad Libs?

24:15.620 --> 24:17.589
We're prepping for surgery.

24:17.656 --> 24:20.625
Oh, thank you, but I got it.

24:20.692 --> 24:21.827
I know you're not
into team sports,

24:21.893 --> 24:23.461
but you can't do
this surgery by yourself.

24:23.528 --> 24:24.462
I don't plan to.

24:24.529 --> 24:26.231
Dr. Glass and I are going to be

24:26.298 --> 24:28.466
{\an5}shoulder to shoulder
and before--

24:26.298 --> 24:28.466
Not today, Jerry.

24:28.533 --> 24:30.669
(quietly):
Joey.

24:30.735 --> 24:32.504
RHONDA: You want
to impress me...

24:32.571 --> 24:33.772
{\an3}try building the backbone
it takes to deliver

24:33.839 --> 24:35.640
bad news as well as good.

24:35.707 --> 24:38.043
While you were busy showing off,
Dr. Trulie here

24:38.109 --> 24:39.911
took one for the team.

24:39.978 --> 24:41.847
{\an3}That's how you make
yourself indispensable.

24:41.913 --> 24:43.682
Lead assist's yours.

24:43.748 --> 24:45.684
The rest of you get in there
and try and learn something.

24:45.750 --> 24:47.686
Except you, you can watch

24:47.752 --> 24:48.987
from the cheap seats.

24:49.054 --> 24:50.889
{\an3}Let's go put a lady
back together.

24:53.925 --> 24:55.727
Any advice for nerves?

24:55.794 --> 24:58.029
Yeah. Reattach them all.

24:59.798 --> 25:01.867
Ah, remember that ER patient

25:01.933 --> 25:04.269
who had a complete heart block
and crashed in front of you?

25:04.336 --> 25:06.538
Yeah.

25:06.605 --> 25:08.607
Well, the attending didn't have
the nerve to run that pacer wire

25:08.673 --> 25:11.543
down to her heart...
so you did it.

25:11.610 --> 25:13.645
As an intern.

25:13.712 --> 25:15.881
You got this.

25:16.915 --> 25:18.083
{\an1}Okay.

25:20.886 --> 25:23.288
RHONDA:
What's the total ischemic time?

25:23.355 --> 25:24.990
{\an5}Estimated five hours.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.990
Gotta hustle.

25:25.056 --> 25:27.292
If we wait any longer,
the reperfusion injury

25:27.359 --> 25:29.694
will be too great
and the arm won't take.

25:29.761 --> 25:31.763
{\an5}Dr. Shah?

25:29.761 --> 25:31.763
Vessels are cleaned and ready.

25:31.830 --> 25:33.832
Okay, Dr. Trulie.

25:33.899 --> 25:35.901
This is your moment.

25:40.739 --> 25:42.574
Mm-hmm.

25:42.641 --> 25:44.609
{\an3}Nice and...

25:44.676 --> 25:46.978
{\an3}delicate.

25:49.381 --> 25:52.050
Make sure
that anastomosis is tight.

25:52.117 --> 25:53.852
We can't afford
any more blood loss.

25:53.919 --> 25:55.654
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

25:57.889 --> 26:00.725
You have fans.

26:00.792 --> 26:03.628
Oh, let's hit a home run.

26:03.695 --> 26:05.797
If we take these clamps

26:05.864 --> 26:07.632
{\an3}off and we've
done it all right,

26:07.699 --> 26:09.334
that arm should go pink.

26:09.401 --> 26:11.870
Moment of truth.

26:13.772 --> 26:15.774
Three, two...

26:20.412 --> 26:21.579
(alarm beeping)

26:21.646 --> 26:22.948
What's wrong?

26:23.014 --> 26:24.683
{\an1}You back-walled
one of the sutures.

26:24.749 --> 26:26.351
Happened to me
my first time, too.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.620
Don't panic. Take it again.

26:28.687 --> 26:30.689
Me? Shouldn't you just...

26:30.755 --> 26:32.791
This is you, Dr. Trulie.

26:32.857 --> 26:34.159
(exhales)

26:43.935 --> 26:45.770
{\an1}RHONDA:
I think we got it.

26:45.837 --> 26:48.173
{\an1}Take two.

26:48.239 --> 26:51.910
{\an3}Dr. Trulie...
remove the clamps.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.766
{\an5}We have a pulse.

27:12.464 --> 27:14.766
(Lex exhales)

27:16.134 --> 27:17.869
Well done, Dr. Trulie.

27:27.445 --> 27:29.180
{\an3}Confirmatory test for <i> Treponema</i>
<i>pallidum</i> was negativ.

27:29.247 --> 27:31.349
{\an5}So it's not syphilis.

27:29.247 --> 27:31.349
Something else caused

27:31.416 --> 27:32.684
the RPR to be positive.

27:32.751 --> 27:34.419
{\an3}Could it be TB? Malaria?
Maybe pneumonia?

27:34.486 --> 27:36.187
{\an3}I mean, all have been
linked to false positives.

27:36.254 --> 27:38.089
Autoimmune disorders as well.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.091
{\an3}So we broaden his antibiotics
to cover our bases.

27:40.158 --> 27:41.993
{\an1}Even if it is autoimmune,
we put him on steroids,

27:42.060 --> 27:43.795
{\an1}then we're gonna weaken
his immune system.

27:43.862 --> 27:45.130
Which will only make him sicker.

27:45.196 --> 27:46.331
We got to increase his pressors

27:46.398 --> 27:47.932
and prep him for dialysis.
I mean,

27:47.999 --> 27:49.801
if we can't control
his fluid output, this guy's

27:49.868 --> 27:51.870
{\an5}headed for ECMO.

27:49.868 --> 27:51.870
Chromatic scale?

27:51.936 --> 27:53.271
Oh, harmonic minor, actually.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.206
Oh, harmonic minor means
you're really stressed.

27:55.273 --> 27:57.142
(chuckles)

27:55.273 --> 27:57.142
{\an3}Hey.

27:57.208 --> 27:58.343
You know you can talk
to me, right?

27:58.410 --> 28:00.111
If... there's something
on your mind.

28:02.947 --> 28:05.050
Thanks, I don't need to talk.

28:05.116 --> 28:07.152
{\an1}I just need
some answers.

28:07.218 --> 28:10.188
{\an5}I just keep hitting...

28:07.218 --> 28:10.188
(phone buzzing)

28:10.255 --> 28:12.824
...wall after wall and...

28:14.359 --> 28:16.094
This might be the answer
that I need.

28:16.161 --> 28:17.762
Hi, this is Sam Griffith.

28:17.829 --> 28:20.198
{\an1}Thank you
for calling me back.

28:20.265 --> 28:21.900
Did it work?

28:21.966 --> 28:23.134
{\an1}That's what we're here
to find out.

28:23.201 --> 28:24.836
Dr. Trulie?

28:35.980 --> 28:38.049
Can you wiggle your fingers?

28:50.995 --> 28:52.831
(exhales)

28:52.897 --> 28:54.265
That's what I'm talking about.

28:54.332 --> 28:56.334
(exhaling)

29:00.004 --> 29:03.074
Beth is still gone.

29:06.878 --> 29:08.913
I know.

29:08.980 --> 29:12.083
I'd give up my arm
just to see her again.

29:12.150 --> 29:14.219
{\an1}Even...

29:14.285 --> 29:16.421
even just to say goodbye. I...

29:23.428 --> 29:26.364
Hey, you did great.

29:26.431 --> 29:28.099
That was quite
some surgery.

29:28.166 --> 29:29.434
That's not why I texted you.

29:29.501 --> 29:31.402
I just reattached
all those tiny nerves,

29:31.469 --> 29:33.304
{\an1}and I kept thinking about
how she never stopped feeling

29:33.371 --> 29:36.441
{\an1}her arm; even after she lost it,
she could still feel it.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.176
Uh-uh.

29:38.243 --> 29:39.911
The phantom limb thing.

29:39.978 --> 29:41.913
I get it.

29:41.980 --> 29:44.015
I wish I didn't, but...

29:44.082 --> 29:47.051
I miss you, too.

29:47.118 --> 29:49.220
I know.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.122
Oh, you do?

29:51.189 --> 29:53.191
{\an5}Well, how could you not?

29:51.189 --> 29:53.191
{\an1}(laughs)

29:57.028 --> 29:59.864
It doesn't change things,
though.

29:59.931 --> 30:02.167
Okay, so...

30:02.233 --> 30:05.103
uh, why are we
in the closet?

30:05.170 --> 30:07.839
Because we can be.

30:07.906 --> 30:10.308
That patient did not get
a chance to say goodbye

30:10.375 --> 30:12.377
to her friend and I just...

30:12.443 --> 30:15.079
(exhales)

30:15.146 --> 30:17.248
I'm glad you're not dead.

30:17.315 --> 30:19.350
Well, that's one of the most

30:19.417 --> 30:21.452
romantic things
anyone's ever said to me.

30:21.519 --> 30:23.121
{\an5}Shut up.

30:21.519 --> 30:23.121
That surgery really

30:23.188 --> 30:24.422
brought out
your sentimental side.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.158
Okay, I'm going.

30:28.993 --> 30:31.896
Okay.

30:31.963 --> 30:34.065
So, go.

30:35.300 --> 30:37.101
Bye.

30:41.940 --> 30:44.275
(phone ringing)

30:46.477 --> 30:49.113
This is Dr. Griffith.
Who is this?

30:51.482 --> 30:53.885
She did what?

30:53.952 --> 30:56.020
{\an1}It's so unfair.
I studied, I prepped.

30:56.087 --> 30:58.456
{\an1}I was ready for that surgery,
but, what, I don't get to do it

30:58.523 --> 31:00.491
{\an1}because I don't
"take one for the team"?

31:00.558 --> 31:02.360
{\an1}Like, where's that class
in medical school?

31:02.427 --> 31:03.962
And how's the patient?

31:04.028 --> 31:05.396
Oh, just peachy.

31:05.463 --> 31:07.165
Lex did a great job.

31:07.232 --> 31:08.466
So it's a win
for everyone.

31:08.533 --> 31:10.168
{\an1}(sighs)
Not you, too.

31:10.235 --> 31:12.904
{\an1}Residency is
a competition.

31:12.971 --> 31:14.272
We're not a team.

31:14.339 --> 31:16.174
Okay, but...

31:16.241 --> 31:19.477
{\an3}you did miss out on a
major surgery, and if you

31:19.544 --> 31:22.046
don't find a way to play nice,
it's not gonna be the last one.

31:22.113 --> 31:24.415
Also, I love you, but...

31:24.482 --> 31:26.517
I can't be the only one
that you connect with.

31:26.584 --> 31:29.020
You need friends.

31:29.087 --> 31:30.388
I need you to have friends.

31:32.223 --> 31:33.524
(growls)

31:33.591 --> 31:35.593
{\an3}(laughs)

31:38.029 --> 31:39.397
(sighs)

31:39.464 --> 31:41.099
How?

31:41.165 --> 31:42.467
A friendly gesture?

31:42.533 --> 31:45.536
(chuckling):
Friendly gesture...

31:49.073 --> 31:51.609
I have an idea.

31:53.278 --> 31:55.046
{\an1}Hey. Hey!

31:55.113 --> 31:57.081
{\an5}(groans)

31:55.113 --> 31:57.081
Stop cold-calling the patients.

31:57.148 --> 31:59.384
I'm only calling patients
who came into the hospital

31:59.450 --> 32:01.185
around the time
of the drug trial.

32:01.252 --> 32:03.221
{\an3}With symptoms like in the
report that you buried.

32:03.288 --> 32:06.090
If there are patients out there,

32:06.157 --> 32:07.492
{\an5}I'm gonna find them.

32:06.157 --> 32:07.492
Oh, you found one.

32:07.558 --> 32:09.494
You scared the hell out of him.
He called me.

32:09.560 --> 32:11.496
No one I've spoken to
has confirmed

32:11.562 --> 32:13.231
they were part
of your clinical trial.

32:13.298 --> 32:14.532
That's because they...

32:14.599 --> 32:16.234
{\an3}They don't want
to violate

32:16.301 --> 32:18.036
{\an3}the terms of
their agreement.

32:19.037 --> 32:20.605
What agreement?

32:21.639 --> 32:23.408
Look.

32:23.474 --> 32:26.544
{\an3}I signed off on the trial before
I found out about the three

32:26.611 --> 32:28.479
patients who had
adverse reactions.

32:28.546 --> 32:30.315
By then, it was too late--
Fletcher were not gonna

32:30.381 --> 32:33.351
retract the report, they were
not gonna publish an addendum.

32:33.418 --> 32:34.986
You could've gone public.

32:35.053 --> 32:37.088
How would that've helped
the patients?

32:37.155 --> 32:40.124
No, instead,
I got Helen to pay them a lot.

32:40.191 --> 32:42.126
Hush money. You silenced

32:42.193 --> 32:43.995
those three people,
and what about the rest who...

32:44.062 --> 32:46.264
I made the best
out of a bad situation.

32:46.331 --> 32:49.133
They got set up for life, but
you keep going down this road,

32:49.200 --> 32:51.035
you're gonna ruin it for them.

32:51.102 --> 32:52.403
That money is
the only good thing

32:52.470 --> 32:54.172
that came out of
that nightmare.

32:54.238 --> 32:56.207
Leave it alone.

32:56.274 --> 32:58.343
{\an1}(exhales)

33:05.183 --> 33:07.418
{\an5}Hey, are you okay?

33:05.183 --> 33:07.418
Hmm?

33:07.485 --> 33:09.120
Ooh, that's a no.

33:09.187 --> 33:12.090
Oh, yeah, it's a no.
I am in an impossible situation.

33:12.156 --> 33:14.359
I want to help people,
but if I help them,

33:14.425 --> 33:16.327
I am gonna hurt them.
And if I take

33:16.394 --> 33:18.329
{\an1}this money, I'm gonna lose
my job, and if I don't bring

33:18.396 --> 33:20.365
money into the hospital,
I'm gonna lose my job anyway!

33:20.431 --> 33:22.033
Whoa, whoa, I'm lost.

33:22.100 --> 33:24.135
I am damned if I do,
and I am damned if I don't.

33:24.202 --> 33:26.104
And it is all because of him!

33:29.107 --> 33:30.541
I didn't expect that to happen.

33:30.608 --> 33:32.477
You know what?
You're coming with me.

33:32.543 --> 33:34.178
What?

33:32.543 --> 33:34.178
{\an3}Yeah.

33:34.245 --> 33:36.180
{\an5}I should...

33:34.245 --> 33:36.180
No, no, no, leave it.

33:36.247 --> 33:39.150
{\an6}I can't believe you
picked that lock.

33:36.247 --> 33:39.150
It was open.

33:39.217 --> 33:41.085
I won't tell
if you won't.

33:41.152 --> 33:42.520
{\an3}(whimpers)

33:42.587 --> 33:45.289
{\an3}I just remember the
lake being... roomier.

33:45.356 --> 33:47.658
{\an1}Well, it's the best
I could do on short notice.

33:47.725 --> 33:49.460
Oh...

33:49.527 --> 33:51.529
Oh, God, oh, God.

33:51.596 --> 33:53.431
{\an3}(laughs)

33:53.498 --> 33:54.632
{\an1}Okay...

33:54.699 --> 33:57.468
Oh, okay.

33:57.535 --> 34:00.304
{\an5}Ready?

33:57.535 --> 34:00.304
(exhales)

34:00.371 --> 34:01.372
BOTH:
Now!

34:02.673 --> 34:05.243
(both gasping)

34:05.309 --> 34:07.078
{\an5}Oh, my...

34:05.309 --> 34:07.078
(both shushing)

34:07.145 --> 34:08.413
(Sam laughing)

34:08.478 --> 34:10.148
(exhales, chuckles)

34:10.214 --> 34:11.581
(both laughing)

34:11.649 --> 34:13.351
Ooh...

34:13.418 --> 34:15.620
(both chuckle)

34:15.686 --> 34:18.356
What were we thinking,
jumping into lakes?

34:18.422 --> 34:20.425
We were thinking it felt good.

34:23.661 --> 34:26.097
{\an1}Now I'm...

34:26.164 --> 34:28.266
{\an1}remembering
what we did after.

34:28.331 --> 34:30.201
{\an1}Caleb, I didn't mean
to give you the wrong idea.

34:30.268 --> 34:32.103
You didn't and I'm not--

34:32.170 --> 34:34.505
{\an3}Sam, I know you're
with Malcolm.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.475
And if that's what you want,
I'm happy for you.

34:39.377 --> 34:41.612
But I'm still crazy about you.

34:42.746 --> 34:45.149
(breathes deeply)

34:45.216 --> 34:48.252
Caleb, what we had was...

34:48.319 --> 34:50.521
good, but it feels
like another life.

34:50.588 --> 34:52.657
I... I can't go back to that.

34:52.723 --> 34:54.225
I don't want to go back.

34:54.292 --> 34:56.494
{\an3}That's what I want
to tell you.

34:56.561 --> 34:58.362
I don't want
to get our old thing back.

34:58.429 --> 35:00.465
I want us to make a new thing.

35:00.531 --> 35:02.533
"A new thing"?

35:02.600 --> 35:04.769
{\an3}Us... 2.0.

35:08.739 --> 35:10.541
I'm sorry.

35:10.608 --> 35:12.543
{\an3}I have to go.
(sniffles)

35:12.610 --> 35:14.245
Ow!

35:12.610 --> 35:14.245
Oh!

35:14.312 --> 35:15.413
Hey, you okay?

35:15.480 --> 35:16.681
Oh, yeah, no.

35:16.747 --> 35:18.483
I'm-I'm-I'm okay, I'm fine.

35:18.549 --> 35:21.486
{\an3}I just, my legs are
numb from the cold...

35:23.488 --> 35:26.424
{\an3}Noah. The numbness
in his legs.

35:26.491 --> 35:27.758
Meet me upstairs.

35:35.466 --> 35:37.435
Joint pain, rash, fatigue;
they're all

35:37.502 --> 35:39.237
{\an5}nonspecific symptoms.

35:37.502 --> 35:39.237
{\an3}But then

35:39.303 --> 35:40.538
you told us that your
brother's legs go numb

35:40.605 --> 35:41.472
when he's working.

35:41.539 --> 35:43.174
And that made it
a whole lot more specific.

35:43.241 --> 35:44.242
{\an3}It's called
claudication.

35:44.308 --> 35:45.910
SAM: It's a decrease in
blood flow to the lower

35:45.977 --> 35:47.512
{\an3}extremities
during exertion.

35:47.578 --> 35:49.413
Now, we thought this could
be caused by an infection.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.182
{\an1}But radiology
proved us wrong.

35:51.249 --> 35:52.650
{\an3}It's large vessel
arteritis.

35:53.784 --> 35:55.553
{\an1}What the heck
does that mean?

35:55.620 --> 35:57.455
{\an1}You have
an autoimmune disease.

35:57.522 --> 35:59.290
But it's a treatable one.

35:59.357 --> 36:02.326
{\an1}We've already started you
on an IVIG infusion.

36:02.393 --> 36:04.629
I don't even know what to say.

36:05.796 --> 36:07.598
{\an3}Say you'll finally
sell the farm.

36:07.665 --> 36:09.567
Farming is all I know.

36:09.634 --> 36:12.336
What the hell am I gonna do
with myself all day?

36:12.403 --> 36:14.572
If this treatment works
as well as I think it will,

36:14.639 --> 36:16.574
{\an1}you can do

36:16.641 --> 36:18.576
whatever you please.

36:21.412 --> 36:24.248
{\an1}GRIFF:
So your decision

36:24.315 --> 36:26.751
to alter your patient's chart
paid off?

36:26.817 --> 36:29.220
It shouldn't have
to be that way.

36:29.287 --> 36:30.655
No, but it is.

36:30.721 --> 36:32.590
And you did,
and you made the best

36:32.657 --> 36:34.559
of a bad situation.

36:34.625 --> 36:36.360
Don't do that.

36:36.427 --> 36:37.728
We are not the same.

36:37.795 --> 36:39.530
I did what I did

36:39.597 --> 36:41.766
to cover my patient's care.

36:41.832 --> 36:43.634
And you did what you did

36:43.701 --> 36:45.436
to cover your ass.

36:48.806 --> 36:51.509
Okay, well, just remember

36:51.576 --> 36:54.612
that it wasn't those labs that
saved your guy, it was Helen.

36:54.679 --> 36:57.782
Her money paid for his care.

36:57.848 --> 37:01.619
It's got to be worth
something in the end, right?

37:01.686 --> 37:03.621
I mean, we can
agree on that.

37:03.688 --> 37:06.424
Actually, yes.
On that, we agree.

37:08.626 --> 37:10.561
{\an1}I was glad
to get your call.

37:10.628 --> 37:12.697
{\an1}Your father said
that you would come around.

37:12.763 --> 37:14.632
Sounds like him.

37:14.699 --> 37:16.467
He did help me make the decision

37:16.534 --> 37:18.469
to accept your donation
on Lakeshore's behalf.

37:20.738 --> 37:23.541
But I'm not stepping down.

37:23.608 --> 37:25.876
{\an3}And you're gonna back me
instead of my father.

37:25.943 --> 37:27.545
Excuse me?

37:27.612 --> 37:28.813
Your drug trial?

37:28.879 --> 37:30.781
With the adverse side effects.

37:30.848 --> 37:32.483
And the payouts.

37:32.550 --> 37:34.752
My father didn't tie up

37:34.819 --> 37:37.288
{\an3}your loose ends as well as
he may have led you to believe.

37:37.355 --> 37:39.523
I have the records.

37:39.590 --> 37:41.359
Why should I trust you?

37:41.425 --> 37:43.628
Because I'm sitting here
with you right now

37:43.694 --> 37:46.864
instead of with the press,
and it'll stay that way,

37:46.931 --> 37:50.568
as long as the $14 million
you pledged comes in.

37:52.870 --> 37:56.574
I think you have a real shot
at beating your father.

37:57.775 --> 37:59.644
With your donation
in my plus column,

37:59.710 --> 38:01.846
I'm inclined to agree.

38:01.912 --> 38:03.914
I'll have the money wired over

38:03.981 --> 38:05.716
first thing tomorrow.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.852
Lakeshore thanks you.

38:12.723 --> 38:14.725
Hey, how'd it go

38:14.792 --> 38:16.727
{\an5}with, uh...

38:14.792 --> 38:16.727
You were right.

38:16.794 --> 38:19.597
{\an3}About Caleb.
There is something there.

38:19.664 --> 38:21.832
(exhales) Okay.

38:21.899 --> 38:23.834
{\an1}Um...

38:23.901 --> 38:26.537
{\an1}is this the part where you tell
me you're still into your ex?

38:29.640 --> 38:31.809
Mm.

38:29.640 --> 38:31.809
{\an3}Mm-mm.

38:33.511 --> 38:36.347
This is the part
where I realize

38:36.414 --> 38:38.516
that you wouldn't care
about what Caleb feels

38:38.582 --> 38:41.385
{\an6}if you knew
how I feel.

38:38.582 --> 38:41.385
Hmm.

38:41.452 --> 38:43.754
I'm in this with you.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.891
Like,<i> in</i> in.

38:48.559 --> 38:50.394
Well, good.

38:50.461 --> 38:51.829
Me, too.

38:55.733 --> 38:57.702
{\an1}I wouldn't exactly call
an old ambulance

38:57.768 --> 39:00.371
{\an5}a surprise.

38:57.768 --> 39:00.371
Joey, what is this?

39:00.438 --> 39:02.973
I call it a friendly gesture.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.943
I give you...

39:06.010 --> 39:09.547
"the ambulounge."

39:09.613 --> 39:11.482
{\an1}Dumb name.

39:11.549 --> 39:13.384
But I like it.

39:13.451 --> 39:15.386
♪ I've been lost and found... ♪

39:15.453 --> 39:17.488
No one comes here, so this is

39:17.555 --> 39:19.523
our place. And check this out!

39:21.559 --> 39:22.793
Trail mix.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.528
(laughter)

39:24.595 --> 39:27.565
(clears throat)
Uh, it's come to my...

39:27.631 --> 39:29.667
attention that...

39:29.734 --> 39:31.669
perhaps I have trouble...

39:31.736 --> 39:33.971
connecting... with patients

39:34.038 --> 39:35.973
and you guys.

39:36.040 --> 39:38.576
{\an3}So maybe I need a little
less competition

39:38.642 --> 39:41.011
and more, uh...

39:41.078 --> 39:42.747
{\an1}Friends.
The term is friends.

39:42.813 --> 39:44.582
Yes, sure.

39:44.648 --> 39:45.750
It's like
when two people connect

39:45.816 --> 39:47.551
{\an5}on a deeper level.

39:45.816 --> 39:47.551
I know what it is.

39:47.618 --> 39:48.819
{\an5}(phone chimes)

39:47.618 --> 39:48.819
Could you please elaborate?

39:48.886 --> 39:50.888
Guys, Lakeshore finished

39:50.955 --> 39:53.491
their internal report.

39:54.859 --> 39:58.729
They're saying I am not
at fault for negligence.

39:58.796 --> 39:59.964
What a relief.

40:00.030 --> 40:01.866
LEX:
Cheers to Isan!

40:01.932 --> 40:04.568
CALEB:
Cheers!

40:04.635 --> 40:06.604
{\an3}Cheers.

40:04.635 --> 40:06.604
Yeah!

40:06.670 --> 40:10.574
Mom, I'm sorry that
I snapped at you about Rhonda.

40:10.641 --> 40:13.577
{\an6}Oh.

40:10.641 --> 40:13.577
I know that you were
just trying to protect me.

40:13.644 --> 40:16.981
And I know that I can
always trust you, so...

40:17.047 --> 40:19.450
{\an3}Sweetheart,
I just...

40:19.517 --> 40:21.452
I worry for you, I mean...

40:21.519 --> 40:22.820
{\an6}Rhonda...

40:21.519 --> 40:22.820
Has her own agenda?

40:22.887 --> 40:24.655
Yeah.

40:24.722 --> 40:27.691
You don't need to worry,
my eyes are... wide open now.

40:38.636 --> 40:40.838
{\an3}(exhales)

40:40.905 --> 40:42.640
Crisis averted.

40:42.706 --> 40:43.941
She found my donor list,

40:44.008 --> 40:45.543
{\an1}but she didn't
find this.

40:45.609 --> 40:47.077
That was too
close a call.

40:47.144 --> 40:49.013
I don't like keeping
this secret from Sam.

40:49.079 --> 40:51.715
Well, we agreed

40:51.782 --> 40:53.984
{\an1}it was best
a long time ago.

40:54.051 --> 40:56.821
{\an3}It's just so
much to carry.

40:56.887 --> 40:59.690
{\an1}You're not
carrying it alone.

41:00.958 --> 41:02.726
{\an1}(sighs)

41:04.829 --> 41:07.765
{\an3}Congratulations.
Everyone's talking

41:07.832 --> 41:09.967
about the massive,
anonymous donation

41:10.034 --> 41:13.070
made to the CT department
in your name.

41:13.137 --> 41:15.773
Thanks in part to you.

41:15.840 --> 41:17.641
I assume you're here

41:17.708 --> 41:19.710
{\an1}to collect
on our agreement?

41:20.711 --> 41:22.046
Only fair, right?

41:22.112 --> 41:24.982
I knew your help came
with a price.

41:26.984 --> 41:30.654
What exactly do you have
planned for my father?

41:30.721 --> 41:33.090
No.

41:33.157 --> 41:35.993
This isn't about your father.

41:36.060 --> 41:38.929
It's your mother
we need to talk about.
