WEBVTT

00:02.990 --> 00:04.812
From the top, one more time, guys.

00:04.932 --> 00:06.919
Everyone, I need your attention.
Gather up.

00:07.192 --> 00:09.516
I said everyone, Sketch-Tron 6000.

00:11.600 --> 00:13.189
Mr. Hank Hooper,

00:13.309 --> 00:16.155
the owner of our new
parent company, Kabletown,

00:16.165 --> 00:18.695
is touring 30 Rock
for the first time today.

00:18.703 --> 00:20.937
I <i>will</i> make
a good first impression,

00:21.772 --> 00:24.130
so I need all of you
to be your most normal.

00:24.197 --> 00:27.132
Tracy, do not mention where
you think dinosaurs come from.

00:27.200 --> 00:28.567
Do not mention
the underwater city

00:28.634 --> 00:30.002
of Sauronicon...
Got it.

00:30.069 --> 00:31.470
Jenna, get all of your
crazy yelling

00:31.537 --> 00:32.554
out of your system.

00:32.637 --> 00:33.772
If you don't volumize my hair,

00:33.840 --> 00:35.340
I will choke you to death

00:35.408 --> 00:37.642
- with your boyfriend's wig!
- Very good.

00:37.710 --> 00:39.544
Frank, how is
your armpit thing?

00:39.612 --> 00:41.813
Not great. It's almost
touching my thigh thing.

00:41.881 --> 00:46.585
Okay, let's do our best.

00:46.652 --> 00:50.222
Remember, everyone,
just don't be yourselves.

00:50.289 --> 00:53.041
Lemon, meet me
in my office in ten.

00:53.126 --> 00:54.326
I need to ask you something.

00:54.377 --> 00:56.661
Oh, do you need sex advice?
Here's a tip.

00:56.729 --> 00:59.097
Sometimes a lady likes
to leave her blazer on.

01:01.534 --> 01:04.720
Sir, ma'am,
this is for you... a gift bag.

01:04.804 --> 01:07.072
"To my two favorite
sketch stars.

01:07.140 --> 01:09.558
Your new friend,
Hank Hooper."

01:09.642 --> 01:12.477
That's nice.
Actors deserve gifts.

01:12.545 --> 01:14.980
Without us, who would
present awards to actors?

01:17.767 --> 01:21.520
So...Which one of us is
going to get this computer?

01:21.571 --> 01:24.055
Just kidding.
We both are!

01:24.107 --> 01:25.690
Wow, I always wanted
one of these.

01:25.758 --> 01:27.359
The box would make
a perfect coffin

01:27.427 --> 01:28.410
for my Teddy Bear.

01:28.494 --> 01:31.229
There's two of everything!

01:31.280 --> 01:34.800
Look at us.
When we met four years ago,

01:34.867 --> 01:36.868
we were fighting about
the silliest things...

01:36.936 --> 01:38.703
Dressing rooms, air time,

01:38.771 --> 01:40.539
you coming in
and ruining my show...

01:40.606 --> 01:42.374
You taking
my nephew's virginity.

01:42.442 --> 01:45.744
I feel we've finally found
a balance in our relationship.

01:51.684 --> 01:53.952
There's only one.

01:54.020 --> 01:57.155
You take it.
I don't care.

01:57.223 --> 01:59.925
I want you to selfishly take
the best sweatshirt

01:59.992 --> 02:02.494
in the world.

02:04.280 --> 02:06.898
Lemon, this is
a little delicate,

02:06.949 --> 02:10.001
but I wonder if you
might take Avery shopping

02:10.068 --> 02:11.203
for baby things.

02:11.270 --> 02:13.438
- Oh, sure.
- You know, a crib,

02:13.506 --> 02:15.407
small clothes, a tiny desk

02:15.475 --> 02:17.542
with a miniature pen set on it.

02:17.610 --> 02:19.077
I don't know a lot
about babies,

02:19.145 --> 02:20.579
but I know that
Avery would enjoy

02:20.646 --> 02:22.914
having another woman
go with her.

02:22.982 --> 02:24.249
Of course.
I'm just a little surprised.

02:24.317 --> 02:26.918
I assumed Avery would have
a terrifying best friend

02:26.986 --> 02:28.553
she'd do stuff like that with.

02:28.621 --> 02:29.921
Avery does have a sister,

02:29.972 --> 02:32.324
but Eugenia is currently
institutionalized for nerves...

02:32.391 --> 02:33.458
Lesbian...

02:33.526 --> 02:34.759
And all of her work friends
are out

02:34.827 --> 02:36.061
because she's still trying

02:36.129 --> 02:37.562
to keep her pregnancy a secret.

02:37.630 --> 02:39.164
Really?
She's eight months.

02:39.232 --> 02:40.982
How is she possibly hiding it?

02:41.067 --> 02:42.067
Michael Kors is a friend.

02:42.134 --> 02:43.485
We own a gay racehorse
together.

02:43.569 --> 02:45.871
And I convinced him to make
wizard cloaks fashionable

02:45.938 --> 02:47.072
for ladies this winter.

02:47.139 --> 02:48.306
It's my fault for asking.

02:48.374 --> 02:50.775
The problem is that
Avery is very close

02:50.843 --> 02:52.444
to being named
the financial reporter

02:52.512 --> 02:53.612
for <i>NBC Nightly News.</i>

02:53.679 --> 02:54.979
If anyone finds out
she's pregnant,

02:55.031 --> 02:56.114
she won't get the job.

02:56.165 --> 02:58.283
Ah, see,
that would never happen

02:58.334 --> 02:59.951
if <i>men</i> could get pregnant.

03:00.002 --> 03:01.986
Which is the premise
of my one-act play

03:02.038 --> 03:03.922
<i>The Seahorses</i>
<i>of Warwickshire Abbey.</i>

03:03.989 --> 03:06.374
Avery just needs to keep
her condition under wraps

03:06.459 --> 03:08.426
until her contract is signed.

03:08.494 --> 03:09.794
Unfortunately,
her competition for the job

03:09.862 --> 03:13.164
is Carmen Chao...
From MSNBC.

03:13.216 --> 03:15.867
Oh, I know her.
Hey, what ethnicity is she?

03:15.935 --> 03:17.035
No one knows.

03:17.103 --> 03:18.236
In international news,

03:18.304 --> 03:20.105
Mexican president
Felipe Calderon

03:20.173 --> 03:21.673
is traveling this week to China

03:21.741 --> 03:23.408
to meet with premier
Wen Jiabao,

03:23.476 --> 03:25.577
and then stopping
for a well-deserved vacation

03:25.645 --> 03:27.011
in Negril, Jamaica, mon.

03:27.063 --> 03:29.281
If Carmen finds out
Avery's pregnant,

03:29.348 --> 03:31.550
she'll use it to destroy her.
Carmen's very sneaky.

03:31.617 --> 03:33.518
And that's not racist because
I don't know what she is.

03:33.586 --> 03:35.520
Man, we all lead
such complicated lives.

03:35.588 --> 03:36.655
Hey, do you want to go

03:36.722 --> 03:37.855
to that new popcorn place
for lunch?

03:37.907 --> 03:39.374
I'm going
to the executive dining room

03:39.458 --> 03:40.659
to meet with Hank Hooper.

03:40.710 --> 03:42.544
I can't wait to shake his hand.

03:42.628 --> 03:45.130
You can tell a lot about someone
by their handshake.

03:45.198 --> 03:47.766
You are confident.

03:47.833 --> 03:51.336
And you ate dinner
in front of a mirror last night.

03:51.404 --> 03:53.071
Carol's away a lot.

03:56.142 --> 04:06.082
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:12.792 --> 04:15.527
Ahoy there, Jack.

04:15.595 --> 04:17.546
Hank Hooper.
Nice to meet you.

04:17.613 --> 04:20.548
I'm a hugger.

04:20.616 --> 04:22.784
No. Doesn't count
as a hug

04:22.852 --> 04:25.654
unless it goes on
for ten seconds.

04:25.721 --> 04:26.988
Yeah.

04:27.056 --> 04:28.757
Well, it is an honor, sir,
to finally...

04:28.824 --> 04:30.926
I'm no "sir," Jack.
Call me Hank.

04:30.993 --> 04:32.761
Or "hey, idiot,"
like my wife does.

04:32.828 --> 04:35.530
I'm kidding.
She's an angel.

04:35.598 --> 04:36.831
Hey, Jack.

04:36.899 --> 04:38.099
What are you doing here?

04:38.167 --> 04:39.568
No, it's fine, Jack.

04:39.635 --> 04:41.703
Kabletown's a family company,
and where I come from,

04:41.771 --> 04:43.939
families eat together.

04:44.006 --> 04:45.874
This is no longer
the executive dining room.

04:45.942 --> 04:47.742
It's the <i>Everyone</i>
<i>dining room.</i>

04:47.810 --> 04:49.077
Welcome, everyone.

04:55.318 --> 04:58.186
This is where we used to
hold retirement parties.

04:58.254 --> 05:00.755
The balcony below
is probably still littered

05:00.823 --> 05:02.724
with stripper bones.

05:02.792 --> 05:05.427
And now there are people here
wearing sandals.

05:05.494 --> 05:07.195
- Yeah.
- Isn't that nice?

05:07.263 --> 05:09.064
Listen, can I tell you
how happy I am

05:09.131 --> 05:11.299
with the work you've done
for us so far?

05:11.367 --> 05:12.534
It's been outstanding.

05:12.602 --> 05:14.536
Thank you. And believe me,
I'm not done.

05:14.604 --> 05:17.305
I'm working on something new
right now that I think...

05:17.373 --> 05:18.373
Room for a single?

05:18.441 --> 05:20.208
Sure.

05:21.777 --> 05:23.278
Let me ask you a question.

05:23.346 --> 05:26.181
Do you know who came up
with the idea for the DVR?

05:26.248 --> 05:28.416
It was the guy who
drives me home every night.

05:28.484 --> 05:29.651
The original name for the DVR

05:29.719 --> 05:32.587
was "The Thing
Carlos Thought Of."

05:32.655 --> 05:35.957
Since then, I make sure
that once a month,

05:36.025 --> 05:38.326
anyone who works here
can pitch any idea they have

05:38.394 --> 05:39.461
to upper management.

05:39.528 --> 05:41.730
- Anyone?
- Mm.

05:41.797 --> 05:43.465
Mmm.

05:43.532 --> 05:45.467
- I see.
- So I want you

05:45.534 --> 05:47.669
to hear ideas all day tomorrow,

05:47.737 --> 05:48.970
and then report back to me.

05:49.038 --> 05:51.239
I'll be the guy wearing
the Bugs Bunny tie.

05:51.307 --> 05:53.842
- Ha!
- What is this green stuff?

05:53.909 --> 05:56.177
Wipe it off.
Wipe it off!

05:56.245 --> 05:59.514
Ecch, these pregnancy photos
are so tacky.

05:59.582 --> 06:00.915
They're like those
knockoff bags

06:00.983 --> 06:02.584
- you get in Chinatown.
- Really?

06:02.652 --> 06:05.020
I like <i>pradort</i> bag.

06:05.087 --> 06:08.356
Avery Jessup.
<i>Que sorpresa!</i>

06:08.424 --> 06:09.958
Carmen!
What are you doing here.

06:10.026 --> 06:11.960
Oh, I just love babies.

06:12.028 --> 06:13.361
I love their
creepy little hands

06:13.429 --> 06:14.996
and the way they crawl fast,
like a rat monster.

06:15.064 --> 06:18.216
Question is,
what are <i>you</i> doing here.

06:18.284 --> 06:20.285
Oh, she's here with me.

06:20.353 --> 06:22.721
I'm pregnant,
and Avery is helping me

06:22.788 --> 06:26.224
decide what kind
of baby megaphone to buy.

06:26.292 --> 06:27.992
Really?

06:28.060 --> 06:29.961
- You're the pregnant one?
- Yeah.

06:30.029 --> 06:31.413
Some dude jacked me,

06:31.497 --> 06:33.164
and now his sperm is
growing in my stomach.

06:33.232 --> 06:35.500
That's now how babies are made.

06:35.568 --> 06:36.801
We're gonna go.
You're tired.

06:36.869 --> 06:39.037
Oh, you'll find this
interesting.

06:39.105 --> 06:40.205
I'm working on a story
right now

06:40.272 --> 06:42.173
about single mothers
in their 40s.

06:42.241 --> 06:43.975
- That's a great idea.
- So you'll be in it?

06:44.043 --> 06:45.076
Why wouldn't you be?

06:45.144 --> 06:46.478
You just said it was
a great idea,

06:46.545 --> 06:48.546
and you're pregnant, right?

06:48.614 --> 06:50.348
So by the law of verbal traps,

06:50.416 --> 06:52.917
you <i>have</i> to do it.

06:52.985 --> 06:56.621
Okay, Carmen,
I'll be in your story.

06:56.689 --> 06:58.523
You can interview me
at the new popcorn place

06:58.591 --> 06:59.724
on 11th Avenue.

06:59.792 --> 07:01.860
No, we'll do it at your office.

07:01.927 --> 07:03.895
Fine. I'll just go
to the popcorn place alone,

07:03.963 --> 07:05.964
even though all their
advertising suggests

07:06.031 --> 07:07.699
it is a place
for <i>groups</i> of friends

07:07.767 --> 07:10.668
to have a good time.

07:13.456 --> 07:15.924
Hello.

07:16.008 --> 07:18.076
Good sweatshirt to you.

07:18.144 --> 07:20.345
How are you sweatshirting
this sweatshirt?

07:20.413 --> 07:21.780
Is everything all right, Tracy?

07:21.847 --> 07:23.214
I want that sweatshirt!

07:23.265 --> 07:25.917
No. You can't take this
away from me,

07:25.985 --> 07:27.285
like you took away my show.

07:27.353 --> 07:29.754
And my grandmother's
jewelry chest.

07:29.822 --> 07:31.923
Was I supposed to throw up
in something of mine?

07:31.974 --> 07:33.458
You gave this to me.

07:33.526 --> 07:35.593
And I can take it back.
I'm the star here.

07:35.661 --> 07:36.961
And if there's
only one sweatshirt,

07:37.029 --> 07:38.396
the star should have it.

07:38.464 --> 07:40.265
Look how gray it is.

07:40.332 --> 07:42.267
Let me just hold it
for one second.

07:42.334 --> 07:44.736
Well...Okay.

07:44.804 --> 07:47.038
But just one second.

07:47.106 --> 07:48.940
You'll never get her!

07:48.991 --> 07:50.909
Stop!
Sweatshirty is a boy!

07:50.976 --> 07:53.277
Miss Lemon.

07:53.329 --> 07:55.747
Carmen Chao called
about an interview.

07:55.815 --> 07:58.216
Is she doing an expose
on how feminism has led

07:58.283 --> 08:00.218
to a happiness crisis
among educated women?

08:00.286 --> 08:02.153
No, Kenneth, it's nothing.

08:02.221 --> 08:03.555
I'm gonna call Jack
and make it go away.

08:03.622 --> 08:05.140
Check this out.

08:05.224 --> 08:07.225
I was up in the
<i>Everybody</i> dining room,

08:07.293 --> 08:09.260
sharing a table
with B. Dubs here,

08:09.311 --> 08:10.979
and guess what he told me.

08:11.063 --> 08:12.864
Okay, gossip alert.

08:12.932 --> 08:15.316
According to my colleague
Carmen Chao,

08:15.401 --> 08:18.803
our friend Liz Lemon
is pregnant.

08:20.606 --> 08:22.306
Dude, is that true?

08:22.358 --> 08:24.609
- Are you pregnant?
- Isn't that wonderful news?

08:24.660 --> 08:27.679
Lemon told me this morning
she got jacked big time.

08:27.746 --> 08:28.913
Uh, Lemon, a word?

08:31.667 --> 08:33.318
What the hell is gong on?

08:33.385 --> 08:36.187
Thank you for covering
for Avery last night.

08:36.255 --> 08:37.589
But now you're a part of this,

08:37.655 --> 08:39.506
and Carmen Chao is
<i>relentless!</i>

08:39.592 --> 08:41.259
Like a bloodhound.
Perhaps literally.

08:41.326 --> 08:42.927
We still don't know
her genetic background.

08:42.995 --> 08:44.662
So what, now people think
I'm pregnant?

08:44.730 --> 08:46.598
Do I have to do
this mom news story?

08:46.665 --> 08:48.132
There is no news story.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.767
Carmen isn't getting anywhere
with Avery,

08:49.835 --> 08:51.269
so she's trying
to call your bluff.

08:51.337 --> 08:53.538
Well, it is called.
I am telling everyone here

08:53.606 --> 08:54.889
that there's no way
I could be pregnant

08:54.974 --> 08:57.709
because I have had my period
for the last 61 days.

08:57.776 --> 08:58.977
Lemon, please.

08:59.044 --> 09:01.179
Avery's career has never
been more important

09:01.247 --> 09:02.780
because I just don't know
what's happening with mine!

09:02.848 --> 09:04.983
- What? Why?
- Oh...

09:05.050 --> 09:06.551
The <i>Everyone</i> dining room,

09:06.619 --> 09:08.219
open office hours,

09:08.287 --> 09:09.854
memos with emoticons in them!

09:09.922 --> 09:11.956
If this is how
Kabletown does business,

09:12.024 --> 09:13.525
I don't know if
I have a future here.

09:13.592 --> 09:15.593
I'm Jack Donaghy!

09:15.661 --> 09:17.362
Don Geiss gave me this watch

09:17.429 --> 09:18.863
for firing a man
on his deathbed!

09:18.931 --> 09:20.398
So wait, you might leave?

09:20.466 --> 09:22.233
I don't know
if I can survive here.

09:22.301 --> 09:24.335
So I need you to fake
being pregnant

09:24.403 --> 09:25.386
to help my family.

09:25.471 --> 09:27.739
I'm asking you as a friend.

09:27.806 --> 09:29.140
How come when I try
to get you to go

09:29.208 --> 09:30.775
to a murder-mystery party
with me,

09:30.843 --> 09:32.510
it's all, "we're business
colleagues, Lemon"?

09:32.578 --> 09:34.646
Ugh, I don't know why
I ever chose you as a friend.

09:34.713 --> 09:36.514
Let's just be clear
about this... I chose you.

09:36.582 --> 09:39.250
I heard the blessed news, Liz.
May I kiss your stomach?

09:39.318 --> 09:42.353
- Absolutely not.
- Hello, beautiful.

09:42.404 --> 09:43.521
It's Uncle Wutzy.

09:43.572 --> 09:44.789
Oh, hey, Jack, you and I have

09:44.857 --> 09:46.991
a pitch meeting later.

09:47.059 --> 09:48.393
You're a baby.

09:48.460 --> 09:50.461
Yes, you are.
Yes, you're a baby...

09:54.379 --> 09:55.646
So that's basically the show.

09:55.714 --> 09:57.348
And my sidekick is
a hot black chick

09:57.415 --> 09:59.617
who can read minds.

09:59.684 --> 10:00.951
We need a button that switches

10:01.019 --> 10:03.537
from pornography
to basketball immediately.

10:03.622 --> 10:04.622
What you have
isn't fast enough.

10:04.689 --> 10:07.157
My kids are starting
to ask questions

10:07.225 --> 10:08.959
that I can't answer.

10:09.027 --> 10:11.195
This'll just be a minute.

10:11.263 --> 10:13.163
Did you check the lightbulb?

10:13.231 --> 10:16.233
Please do not use that tone.

10:16.301 --> 10:19.236
So much of television
is really not fit for children

10:19.304 --> 10:21.388
or christians or the elderly.

10:21.473 --> 10:24.275
So what if there was
a black bar

10:24.342 --> 10:26.443
on the lower half
of your TV screen

10:26.511 --> 10:28.646
that kept you from seeing
bad things?

10:28.713 --> 10:30.397
Like nudity, or soccer.

10:30.482 --> 10:34.735
Congratulations.
Worst so far!

10:34.819 --> 10:38.188
Liz, I never get anything.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.557
All I want is one sweatshirt.

10:40.609 --> 10:42.159
Don't listen to her.
She's not me.

10:42.226 --> 10:43.193
What is going on?

10:43.261 --> 10:44.227
- This is mine.
- The story begins

10:44.279 --> 10:45.329
when dolphins ruled the earth.

10:45.396 --> 10:47.731
Hey, guys, lay off Liz, okay?

10:47.782 --> 10:50.034
- You know she's pregnant.
- Really?

10:50.085 --> 10:53.103
- Yeah. Super-pregnant.
- Congratulations.

10:53.171 --> 10:56.340
I am not interested
in godfather duties.

10:56.407 --> 10:57.708
Now's not the time
to discuss this,

10:57.759 --> 11:00.044
but I will need to eat
your umbilical cord.

11:00.111 --> 11:01.745
I'm sorry we were
stressing you out.

11:01.813 --> 11:02.880
We shouldn't do that.

11:02.948 --> 11:04.615
It'll turn the child
into a Dracula.

11:04.683 --> 11:05.683
I'm sorry.

11:05.750 --> 11:07.134
You know what,
give me the sweatshirt.

11:10.605 --> 11:12.189
Problem solved.

11:12.256 --> 11:13.274
Now no one gets it.

11:13.358 --> 11:14.358
Aw, man...

11:14.425 --> 11:15.859
Pregnant.

11:15.927 --> 11:16.927
Now get out of here!

11:16.995 --> 11:17.945
And hold hands
like best friends

11:18.029 --> 11:22.633
on the way out.

11:22.701 --> 11:23.951
Oh, that is like magic.

11:24.035 --> 11:25.435
People are nice
to pregnant ladies.

11:25.487 --> 11:27.938
I'm gonna run downstairs.
Do you want anything?

11:27.989 --> 11:29.139
Remember, you're eating
for two.

11:29.207 --> 11:31.075
Well, I guess
two egg sandwiches...

11:31.142 --> 11:32.743
Times two is four.

11:36.164 --> 11:38.382
Good morning!

11:38.450 --> 11:41.051
So how did co-worker
pitch day go, Jack?

11:41.119 --> 11:43.087
Well, <i>employee</i> pitch day was,

11:43.154 --> 11:44.722
of course,
a new experience for me.

11:44.789 --> 11:46.390
Oh, speaking of
new experiences,

11:46.458 --> 11:48.892
I ate at an Indian restaurant
last night.

11:48.960 --> 11:50.160
I had naan.

11:50.228 --> 11:52.646
Sir... I mean, Hank,

11:52.731 --> 11:54.064
I appreciate that you have
your way of doing things,

11:54.132 --> 11:55.265
but so do I.

11:55.333 --> 11:58.002
I am a six sigma
black belt ultra,

11:58.069 --> 11:59.770
with the groin branding
to prove it.

11:59.838 --> 12:01.405
What's six sigma?
Rock band?

12:01.473 --> 12:02.606
I'd like to start this meeting

12:02.674 --> 12:05.275
by sharing one of my own ideas.

12:05.343 --> 12:07.144
And after you hear it,
maybe we can agree

12:07.212 --> 12:09.613
that employee pitch day
is time that could be

12:09.681 --> 12:12.282
better spent drinking and
looking out the window.

12:12.350 --> 12:13.584
Okay, Jack!

12:13.651 --> 12:15.502
You're putting it on the line.

12:15.587 --> 12:17.021
What have you got?

12:17.088 --> 12:19.223
Hank, what's the one part
of the television experience

12:19.290 --> 12:20.424
that's not perfect?

12:20.492 --> 12:22.593
To me, it's the remote control.

12:22.660 --> 12:23.694
Too easy to lose, right?

12:23.762 --> 12:26.363
Yes! I lose my remote
all the time.

12:26.431 --> 12:29.133
Grr, couch cushions!

12:29.184 --> 12:30.834
What if you didn't need
a remote control

12:30.902 --> 12:33.670
because your remote control
was your own voice?

12:33.738 --> 12:37.775
Television on.
Channel, NBC.

12:37.842 --> 12:40.177
A crew out of the Bronx
called the Ace of Deuces.

12:40.245 --> 12:41.512
Amazing.

12:41.579 --> 12:44.448
I give you voice activation.

12:44.516 --> 12:46.950
Word from my C.I.
is he got offed by...

12:47.018 --> 12:48.886
That shouldn't happen.
TV on!

12:48.953 --> 12:52.022
Voice activation,
or "vo-act..."

12:52.073 --> 12:54.324
The only wit we have
is some mute kid...

12:54.392 --> 12:56.894
- Un-mute!
- My friends at the D.E.A. say

12:56.961 --> 12:59.630
these guys have
a high volume of cocaine...

12:59.697 --> 13:01.165
Low volume.
Low volume!

13:01.216 --> 13:03.250
First I want to go home
and delete everything

13:03.334 --> 13:05.369
- that's on my DVR.
- Oh, come on!

13:05.437 --> 13:07.037
TV mute!

13:07.105 --> 13:10.040
Jack, it doesn't seem to work.

13:10.108 --> 13:11.475
You got any other notions,

13:11.543 --> 13:13.210
or should we jump
to employee ideas?

13:13.278 --> 13:15.913
No, no. No.
I have another idea.

13:15.980 --> 13:20.417
What if, uh...
What if...

13:20.485 --> 13:23.287
You had a black bar
at the bottom of the screen

13:23.354 --> 13:25.355
that prevented you from
seeing anything dirty?

13:25.423 --> 13:27.191
I like that.

13:27.242 --> 13:28.525
I like that a lot.

13:28.593 --> 13:30.994
It would allow parents
to eliminate racy content,

13:31.062 --> 13:33.396
like soccer, or a woman
stuffing a turkey.

13:33.448 --> 13:36.166
That's a real family company
kind of idea, Jack.

13:36.234 --> 13:38.419
And we could sell ads
in the black bar...

13:38.503 --> 13:39.770
Increase our revenue streams!

13:39.838 --> 13:41.738
You could call it
"Blabar."

13:41.806 --> 13:43.674
A-plus work, Jack!

13:43.741 --> 13:45.442
I don't need to hear
anything else.

13:45.510 --> 13:47.945
If that's the kind of ideas
you're bringing... nine, ten...

13:48.012 --> 13:53.016
You will go far, son.
Yeah!

13:55.220 --> 13:58.421
Crap.

13:58.473 --> 14:01.024
Kenneth, we need to talk.

14:01.092 --> 14:03.460
Earlier today,
I told Hank Hooper

14:03.528 --> 14:07.097
about your black bar concept,
and he loved it.

14:07.165 --> 14:09.900
However, I presented it
as my own idea.

14:09.968 --> 14:11.902
Wonderful! Next topic.

14:11.953 --> 14:13.804
What? Uh, no.

14:13.872 --> 14:15.906
This is an opportunity for you.

14:15.974 --> 14:18.575
You have me over a barrel.
What are you going to do?

14:18.643 --> 14:20.110
Not what my uncle does

14:20.178 --> 14:22.045
when he gets a hitchhiker over
a barrel, I'll tell you that.

14:22.113 --> 14:23.914
This is business, Kenneth.

14:23.982 --> 14:25.949
All bosses steal
from their employees.

14:26.017 --> 14:28.752
But in return,
the employee gets something.

14:28.820 --> 14:31.188
You didn't steal anything
from me, sir.

14:31.256 --> 14:32.289
Last time I checked,

14:32.340 --> 14:35.058
best friends can't steal
from each other.

14:35.126 --> 14:37.828
Now, stop being a silly Simon.

14:39.814 --> 14:42.666
This isn't how it works!

14:42.734 --> 14:45.602
You're the one being
a silly Simon!

14:47.839 --> 14:49.840
Carmen, what are you
doing here?

14:49.908 --> 14:51.825
Well, you didn't call back
to schedule our interview,

14:51.910 --> 14:53.026
so I thought I'd just
ambush you

14:53.111 --> 14:54.278
with some pregnancy questions.

14:54.329 --> 14:55.829
I hope you're not unprepared.

14:55.914 --> 14:58.282
Of course not.

14:58.333 --> 15:00.851
- When are you due?
- April 20th, Hitler's birthday.

15:00.919 --> 15:02.186
What's your pediatrician's
name?

15:02.253 --> 15:04.288
Dr. Rufus T. Barleysheath.

15:04.355 --> 15:06.006
- Where was the baby conceived?
- In my vagina.

15:06.090 --> 15:07.257
What names are you considering?

15:07.325 --> 15:09.126
- Rufus T. Barleysheath.
- How are you feeling?

15:09.177 --> 15:10.460
Oh, a little achy and nauseous,

15:10.512 --> 15:11.562
- but I'm hanging in there.
- Are you pregnant?

15:11.629 --> 15:15.632
No...way that I'm not.

15:15.700 --> 15:17.100
Owen, screw.

15:19.237 --> 15:20.971
I don't know why
you're doing this for Jessup.

15:21.039 --> 15:22.673
She's a blonde. Don't you know
there's a war going on?

15:22.740 --> 15:25.275
Or are you doing it
for her old man husband?

15:25.343 --> 15:26.443
He's your boss.

15:26.511 --> 15:28.779
First of all,
Jack means nothing to me.

15:28.846 --> 15:30.547
Shoot him in the throat
and let the dogs eat him.

15:30.615 --> 15:31.532
I don't care.

15:31.616 --> 15:32.749
What's wrong with you?

15:32.817 --> 15:34.051
Almost everything.

15:34.118 --> 15:35.185
But let's get back
to the interview.

15:35.236 --> 15:36.753
We're done with that portion.

15:36.821 --> 15:38.488
I thought it would be
a fun visual

15:38.540 --> 15:41.191
if we got some b-roll of you
taking sexy pregnancy photos

15:41.242 --> 15:42.492
where you bare your stomach

15:42.560 --> 15:44.661
like the pregnant bitch
that you are.

15:44.729 --> 15:45.896
What do you say?

15:48.550 --> 15:50.801
Let's take some pictures.

15:55.185 --> 15:58.787
Innovation that is both family
and bottom line friendly.

15:58.855 --> 16:02.958
Gentlemen, I give you Blabar.

16:03.009 --> 16:04.894
You're really sexing me
right now.

16:04.961 --> 16:06.862
It's filthy.

16:09.549 --> 16:10.866
Jack! Jack!

16:10.934 --> 16:14.103
Jack! Jack! Jack...

16:16.000 --> 16:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:29.486 --> 16:30.753
One time, I saw a turtle...

16:30.820 --> 16:35.023
Who the hell
do you think you are?

16:35.075 --> 16:37.059
This is not the way
the world works, Kenneth.

16:37.127 --> 16:38.427
Bosses steal,

16:38.495 --> 16:40.396
and employees use it
for leverage.

16:40.463 --> 16:42.765
So what do you want?
Money? A promotion?

16:42.832 --> 16:43.933
I can get you into a restaurant

16:44.000 --> 16:45.668
where you watch a child
play with a bunny,

16:45.735 --> 16:46.735
then you eat the bunny.

16:46.803 --> 16:48.070
Isn't that just Easter?

16:48.138 --> 16:50.572
And I don't want anything, sir.

16:50.640 --> 16:52.574
I'm just happy
to spend all day here

16:52.642 --> 16:53.776
helping my work family.

16:53.843 --> 16:56.245
Family.
I now work for a man

16:56.313 --> 16:57.646
who thinks like you.

16:57.714 --> 16:59.915
Does he also solve mazes
by starting from the end?

16:59.983 --> 17:02.384
I need this, Kenneth.
I used you, now leverage it.

17:02.452 --> 17:04.319
Blackmail me.
Demand to sleep with Avery.

17:04.387 --> 17:05.721
Hit me.
Hit me in the face!

17:05.789 --> 17:08.490
No, sir.
Best friends don't...

17:08.558 --> 17:10.125
I am ordering you to strike me.

17:10.193 --> 17:11.193
There will be no retaliation,

17:11.261 --> 17:12.560
but if you refuse,
you're fired.

17:12.628 --> 17:14.530
No.
I don't even know how.

17:14.597 --> 17:16.065
Do it! Hit me now!

17:20.770 --> 17:25.741
Oh, damn my krav maga training
and lightning reflexes!

17:27.944 --> 17:30.479
Release me,
you hillbilly Circe!

17:30.547 --> 17:32.097
I am life.

17:32.182 --> 17:34.416
Revel in the glory
of motherhood!

17:34.467 --> 17:36.885
Gaia flows through me.

17:36.953 --> 17:39.321
Rufus T. Barleysheath
is kicking.

17:39.389 --> 17:41.824
I <i>know</i> you're not pregnant.

17:41.891 --> 17:44.226
Why don't you just admit it?

17:44.294 --> 17:45.427
She's grabbing oil.

17:45.478 --> 17:47.696
Owen...Run!

17:47.764 --> 17:49.932
Look how my belly glistens!

17:53.570 --> 17:55.437
What's going on, Jack?

17:55.488 --> 17:57.506
I was just about
to hop on my bus

17:57.574 --> 17:58.640
back to Philadelphia.

17:58.708 --> 17:59.908
I don't fly,
but I got my own bus

17:59.976 --> 18:01.143
with a pool table in it.

18:01.211 --> 18:03.612
We'll drive to Branson
together sometime,

18:03.680 --> 18:05.347
take in a Yakov Smirnoff show.

18:05.415 --> 18:07.416
Doesn't Russia sound
like a crazy place?

18:07.484 --> 18:08.717
Yes, sir.

18:08.785 --> 18:11.420
But before you go,
I want you to meet someone.

18:11.471 --> 18:14.323
This is Kenneth Parcell,
one of our pages.

18:14.391 --> 18:15.474
Oh, I didn't notice
you there, son.

18:15.558 --> 18:17.259
You do not have
a lot of charisma.

18:17.327 --> 18:19.061
Kenneth is the one
who came up with

18:19.129 --> 18:21.530
the Blabar idea, not me.

18:21.598 --> 18:24.266
- I'm sorry I misled you.
- Oh.

18:24.334 --> 18:27.469
Well, Jack, I have to say
I'm surprised.

18:27.520 --> 18:29.571
Here is my letter
of resignation.

18:29.639 --> 18:31.440
It's probably for the best

18:31.491 --> 18:33.475
since this is obviously
not a good fit.

18:33.543 --> 18:35.477
If you call security
to escort me out,

18:35.545 --> 18:37.346
you should know
I have several pistols

18:37.414 --> 18:38.480
hidden on me.

18:38.548 --> 18:41.150
Hold on, Jack.
No one's quitting.

18:41.217 --> 18:42.885
I'm impressed you told me that.

18:42.952 --> 18:46.055
You have a reputation,
Jack, as a shark.

18:46.122 --> 18:49.158
Kabletown, we're not sharks.
We're more like...

18:49.225 --> 18:51.560
Whatever
the friendliest fish is.

18:51.628 --> 18:53.962
I'm not a science guy.
The point is,

18:54.030 --> 18:55.864
I wasn't sure
how you were gonna fit in,

18:55.932 --> 18:58.100
but you doing something
like this

18:58.168 --> 19:00.168
tells me we're gonna be
just fine.

19:00.220 --> 19:03.522
Very well. Good.

19:03.606 --> 19:05.007
And Jack should
give you something

19:05.075 --> 19:07.576
- for that idea, son.
- Finally. Thank you.

19:07.644 --> 19:10.863
- Quid pro quo.
- But I don't want anything.

19:10.947 --> 19:12.347
No?
How about a hug?

19:14.534 --> 19:15.684
You've gotta be kidding me.

19:18.288 --> 19:20.355
- Heh...
- Sir...

19:20.407 --> 19:21.557
It doesn't count as a hug

19:21.624 --> 19:23.358
unless it goes on
for ten seconds.

19:23.426 --> 19:24.660
You got that right, son.

19:24.727 --> 19:30.032
One...Mississippi...

19:30.100 --> 19:32.201
That's some good hugging.

19:32.268 --> 19:34.436
And as excited as I am
to be joining the team

19:34.504 --> 19:35.771
on Nightly News,

19:35.839 --> 19:38.340
I will miss my dear friends
here on basic cable.

19:38.391 --> 19:41.210
But, Carmen, you have an
exciting new assignment, right?

19:41.277 --> 19:43.712
Yes. I will be
covering hurricanes...

19:43.780 --> 19:46.682
Thank you, Lemon.
I owe you.

19:46.733 --> 19:48.434
If you want
to make it up to me,

19:48.518 --> 19:50.352
I have my eye
on a toilet pillow

19:50.403 --> 19:52.387
from a certain
medical supply store.

19:52.439 --> 19:53.856
Avery and I want
the baby's middle name

19:53.923 --> 19:56.225
to be Elizabeth, after you.

19:56.292 --> 19:59.361
Oh, Jack, that's so gayballs.

20:00.663 --> 20:03.949
Hey, Liz.
Can we get you anything?

20:04.033 --> 20:06.568
Do you need some liniment
rubbed on your perineum?

20:06.619 --> 20:08.937
No, guys,
I'm not really pregnant.

20:09.005 --> 20:10.456
I was just pretending
to help Jack.

20:10.540 --> 20:12.774
Why would you pretend
to help Jack?

20:12.842 --> 20:13.775
Help him for real.

20:13.843 --> 20:15.377
It takes the same amount
of time.

20:15.428 --> 20:18.780
No, Tracy, she lied to us.

20:18.848 --> 20:20.081
And she ordered us around

20:20.133 --> 20:21.617
like we were
a couple of <i>normals.</i>

20:21.684 --> 20:24.920
You will be punished.
Can I have my nunchucks back?

20:24.988 --> 20:27.422
Or we could call it even.

20:29.192 --> 20:30.759
Good God!

20:30.810 --> 20:33.862
I have been punished.
These are yours to keep.

20:38.067 --> 20:40.802
What?
Who's the black guy?

20:40.870 --> 20:42.771
A bicycle messenger.

20:42.839 --> 20:45.274
<font color="#ec14bd">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

20:45.341 --> 20:47.435
You took your pants off.

20:47.886 --> 20:50.762
What if there was a channel that's just
the sound of people having a party

20:50.882 --> 20:52.730
so you put it on
when you call your parents?

20:53.425 --> 20:55.790
You know what my TV is?

20:55.910 --> 20:56.861
A sunset.

20:56.981 --> 20:59.360
How about a button you push
on your remote

20:59.480 --> 21:01.861
and you can buy
anything you see on TV?

21:01.981 --> 21:06.185
Like if you're watching Sex and the City and
you just have to have Mr. Big's spaghetti?

21:06.305 --> 21:09.356
What if we executed someone live on TV?

21:10.933 --> 21:13.037
And then I pull off my mask

21:13.157 --> 21:15.771
and I'm a lizard person too.

21:16.151 --> 21:18.501
Blackout. End of episode.

21:19.305 --> 21:25.751
