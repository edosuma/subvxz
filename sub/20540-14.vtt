00:36.100 --> 00:39.133
[cheers and applause]

00:40.834 --> 00:42.967
- Welcome, welcome, welcome

00:42.967 --> 00:44.500
to "Last Week Tonight."

00:44.500 --> 00:45.667
I'm John Oliver.

00:45.667 --> 00:46.900
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:46.900 --> 00:48.533
And before we begin
this evening,

00:48.533 --> 00:51.600
just a quick word regarding
last night's attacks in London,

00:51.600 --> 00:52.967
where seven people were killed

00:52.967 --> 00:54.667
and multiple people
were injured.

00:54.667 --> 00:56.967
Obviously, our thoughts go out
to everyone affected,

00:56.967 --> 01:00.200
but as a British person
living in America,

01:00.200 --> 01:03.333
I feel compelled to address
a certain theme

01:03.333 --> 01:06.867
that emerged through American
coverage of this tragedy.

01:06.867 --> 01:08.567
- The UK is reeling this morning

01:08.567 --> 01:10.700
from yet another
terrorist attack.

01:10.700 --> 01:12.533
- A city reeling
from a terror attack...

01:12.533 --> 01:15.734
- The UK under siege,
essentially.

01:15.734 --> 01:17.667
- London is
under siege.

01:17.667 --> 01:18.900
- This is a country
and a city

01:18.900 --> 01:20.200
that feels,
in some ways, David,

01:20.200 --> 01:21.333
under siege.

01:21.333 --> 01:22.667
- Okay, here's the thing.

01:22.667 --> 01:24.600
For the record, in no way

01:24.600 --> 01:26.266
is Britain under siege.

01:26.266 --> 01:28.000
Is it upset?
Yes.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.233
Is it pissed off?

01:29.233 --> 01:31.500
Oh, you fucking bet
it's pissed off.

01:31.500 --> 01:34.667
But to say it's under siege
and that its people are reeling

01:34.667 --> 01:36.700
is to imply that
it's somehow weak enough

01:36.700 --> 01:40.800
to be brought to its knees
by three monumental assholes.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.133
And that, as an idea,
is insulting.

01:43.133 --> 01:45.433
In fact, British people
were so irritated by headlines

01:45.433 --> 01:46.734
about Britain reeling,

01:46.734 --> 01:48.900
like this one
in "The New York Times,"

01:48.900 --> 01:50.600
they took to Twitter
this morning,

01:50.600 --> 01:53.967
using the hashtag:
ThingsThatLeaveBritainReeling

01:53.967 --> 01:57.266
to show things that,
unlike terrorists,

01:57.266 --> 02:00.600
actually do have the ability
to rock them to their very core,

02:00.600 --> 02:04.266
like, "Accidental eye contact
on the tube or in a lift,"

02:04.266 --> 02:08.000
and "When people make tea
in the microwave."

02:08.000 --> 02:10.900
I can't believe, with a gif
of a monkey screaming.

02:10.900 --> 02:13.700
Honestly, it was
an uplifting demonstration

02:13.700 --> 02:15.967
of quintessentially
British defiance,

02:15.967 --> 02:18.800
because the British people
are never going to let

02:18.800 --> 02:20.500
terror change their way of life.

02:20.500 --> 02:23.533
And if you need proof of this,
just look at this footage

02:23.533 --> 02:25.333
of people being evacuated
from the scene.

02:25.333 --> 02:26.800
You see that one guy there?

02:26.800 --> 02:30.600
He refused to leave
his pint of beer behind.

02:30.600 --> 02:36.100
That is a one-man, walking,
"Keep Calm and Carry On" poster.

02:36.100 --> 02:39.400
But perhaps my favorite reaction
of all came from this man,

02:39.400 --> 02:42.567
who was in a restaurant and
witnessed the attacks firsthand.

02:42.567 --> 02:44.667
He actually went back
to that restaurant this morning

02:44.667 --> 02:47.200
to try and pay his bill
and tip the staff.

02:47.200 --> 02:49.133
And when a reporter asked
whether he was worried

02:49.133 --> 02:52.934
about his safety, this was
his incredible response.

02:52.934 --> 02:54.400
- We're not gonna let
these people win.

02:54.400 --> 02:55.734
And I keep saying,

02:55.734 --> 02:57.700
if me having a gin and tonic
with my friends,

02:57.700 --> 02:58.900
flirting with handsome men,

02:58.900 --> 03:00.200
hanging out
with brilliant women,

03:00.200 --> 03:01.767
is what offends
these people so much,

03:01.767 --> 03:03.467
I'm gonna do it more,
not less,

03:03.467 --> 03:05.667
because that's what
makes London so great.

03:05.667 --> 03:07.400
[cheers and applause]
- Fuck yeah, it is!

03:07.400 --> 03:09.300
Fuck yes, it is!

03:09.300 --> 03:11.633
And I hope, I sincerely hope,

03:11.633 --> 03:13.567
that that guy is
out on the town tonight,

03:13.567 --> 03:15.433
pounding down gin and tonics

03:15.433 --> 03:17.900
and flirting with
every man he sees.

03:17.900 --> 03:21.000
To you, sir, I say this:
cheers.

03:21.000 --> 03:22.834
[cheers and applause]

03:22.834 --> 03:24.500
Cheers to you.

03:24.500 --> 03:26.400
But for now...

03:26.400 --> 03:29.200
for now tonight, let's move on
to Vladimir Putin,

03:29.200 --> 03:31.500
perhaps the biggest threat
to the United States

03:31.500 --> 03:34.166
after the President
of the United States.

03:34.166 --> 03:36.333
Putin was seemingly everywhere
this week,

03:36.333 --> 03:37.800
appearing in
newly released clips

03:37.800 --> 03:39.834
for the upcoming
Oliver Stone series on him,

03:39.834 --> 03:42.300
which looks like
a truly depressing episode

03:42.300 --> 03:44.233
of "Carpool Karaoke."

03:44.233 --> 03:47.467
And also appearing tonight
as guest of honor

03:47.467 --> 03:50.967
on Megyn Kelly's new NBC show,
which I assume is called,

03:50.967 --> 03:55.033
"Forget Everything I Said on Fox
Since 2004 with Megyn Kelly."

03:55.033 --> 03:57.867
But the most notable thing
Putin said this week

03:57.867 --> 04:00.066
was when he admitted
for the very first time

04:00.066 --> 04:02.100
that Russian citizens
may have been involved

04:02.100 --> 04:04.133
in hacking the U.S. election.

04:04.133 --> 04:05.834
- [speaking Russian]

04:05.834 --> 04:07.233
- Hackers are
free-spirited people,

04:07.233 --> 04:08.700
like artists.

04:08.700 --> 04:10.667
If they wake up in the morning
in a good mood,

04:10.667 --> 04:12.333
they paint pictures.

04:12.333 --> 04:13.900
Same way with hackers.

04:13.900 --> 04:15.367
They wake up one morning,

04:15.367 --> 04:16.700
read that something
is going on

04:16.700 --> 04:18.233
in international relations,

04:18.233 --> 04:20.133
and if they are
patriotically minded,

04:20.133 --> 04:22.100
they begin to contribute
in their own way,

04:22.100 --> 04:23.734
which they feel is right.

04:23.734 --> 04:24.934
- Oh, sure.

04:24.934 --> 04:26.600
Hackers are just artistic types

04:26.600 --> 04:28.467
looking for inspiration.

04:28.467 --> 04:30.200
They're like an improv troupe
who said,

04:30.200 --> 04:32.467
"All we need is a location
to get started,"

04:32.467 --> 04:33.967
and someone in the audience
shouted,

04:33.967 --> 04:36.934
"Inside the email server
at the DNC!"

04:36.934 --> 04:40.400
Now, Putin's coy answer there
has now just added smoke

04:40.400 --> 04:42.033
to the concerns
about Russia's connections

04:42.033 --> 04:43.433
to the Trump administration,

04:43.433 --> 04:46.166
smoke that got ever so slightly
thicker this week

04:46.166 --> 04:49.600
after some news that got a bit
lost in other developments.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.867
- All right,
the "Washington Post"

04:50.867 --> 04:52.533
now out with
a report alleging

04:52.533 --> 04:54.567
the Trump White House is looking
to give Russia back

04:54.567 --> 04:56.767
its compounds
in Maryland and New York.

04:56.767 --> 04:59.800
Russian officials were ousted
from those diplomatic compounds

04:59.800 --> 05:02.100
by the Obama administration
in late December

05:02.100 --> 05:04.567
in a direct response
to Moscow's interference

05:04.567 --> 05:06.266
in the 2016 election.

05:06.266 --> 05:08.400
- Yes, it seems
the U.S. is considering

05:08.400 --> 05:10.266
giving Russia back
two compounds,

05:10.266 --> 05:11.934
which have,
since the Reagan era,

05:11.934 --> 05:13.667
been associated
with spying on Americans.

05:13.667 --> 05:15.200
Because with Trump in office,

05:15.200 --> 05:17.700
it seems Putin is about
as likely to get what he wants

05:17.700 --> 05:19.900
as a Make-A-Wish kid
who just wants to meet

05:19.900 --> 05:21.567
Jason Mraz.

05:21.567 --> 05:22.834
Really?

05:22.834 --> 05:24.367
Oh, no,
Jason's definitely available,

05:24.367 --> 05:26.767
I'm just saying...really?

05:26.767 --> 05:28.667
[laughter]

05:28.667 --> 05:30.734
And the reason this is
potentially so worrying

05:30.734 --> 05:32.767
is that the compounds are
directly connected

05:32.767 --> 05:35.066
to the scandal that tripped up
Michael Flynn,

05:35.066 --> 05:37.133
a man whose very face
answers the question,

05:37.133 --> 05:39.734
"What if an eagle
hated Muslims?"

05:39.734 --> 05:42.533
Now, you may remember
that Flynn got in trouble

05:42.533 --> 05:45.033
for misleading answers
about phone calls

05:45.033 --> 05:47.400
with Russia's ambassador
during the Trump transition,

05:47.400 --> 05:49.667
and one subject
of those phone calls

05:49.667 --> 05:51.600
was allegedly whether
Donald Trump would roll back

05:51.600 --> 05:53.967
sanctions on Russia,
sanctions that included

05:53.967 --> 05:56.000
closing these two compounds.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.200
And now it seems that
not only may that happen,

05:58.200 --> 06:01.166
but we're not really expecting
much in return.

06:01.166 --> 06:03.567
- So the Trump administration
appears to be willing

06:03.567 --> 06:05.900
to--to give back
those two compounds,

06:05.900 --> 06:07.667
one in Maryland,
and one in New York,

06:07.667 --> 06:09.367
to the Russians
that had been seized

06:09.367 --> 06:10.900
by the Obama administration,

06:10.900 --> 06:13.333
but it--but Russia's
not coming to the table

06:13.333 --> 06:15.133
to give us anything back.

06:15.133 --> 06:17.934
- And that is why
this looks so bad.

06:17.934 --> 06:20.200
Trump may be handing
the Russians back compounds

06:20.200 --> 06:22.300
from which they have
reportedly spied on us

06:22.300 --> 06:24.633
in the midst of
a special counsel investigating

06:24.633 --> 06:26.734
whether his campaign
colluded with Russia,

06:26.734 --> 06:28.633
an investigation that includes
the issue

06:28.633 --> 06:31.600
of those very compounds
he may now be returning,

06:31.600 --> 06:33.600
and he could be doing
all of this while receiving

06:33.600 --> 06:35.800
nothing for America in return.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.700
And at this point,
I honestly kind of hope

06:37.700 --> 06:39.900
Putin does have
a golden shower tape of him,

06:39.900 --> 06:41.266
because otherwise,

06:41.266 --> 06:45.233
Trump is the worst dealmaker
in human history,

06:45.233 --> 06:48.000
which shouldn't
really be a surprise,

06:48.000 --> 06:49.967
because we all remember

06:49.967 --> 06:52.467
the name of his famous book:
"The Art of the...

06:52.467 --> 06:53.500
"Look, I Never Wanted
Any of This.

06:53.500 --> 06:55.000
"I'm Way Out of My Depth.

07:00.200 --> 07:02.100
"What Did You Do?
What Did you Do, Jared?

07:02.100 --> 07:04.066
Oh, Shiiiit!"

07:04.066 --> 07:05.533
[cheers and applause]

07:05.533 --> 07:07.900
And now, this.

07:14.767 --> 07:17.367
- Does that not strike you
as incredibly cynical?

07:17.367 --> 07:19.333
- It is.
It's incredibly cynical.

07:19.333 --> 07:20.800
That's exactly what it is.

07:20.800 --> 07:23.333
- So do you see this
as a moral obligation?

07:23.333 --> 07:25.867
- Yeah.
It's a moral obligation.

07:25.867 --> 07:27.867
- Well, it was
classified information.

07:27.867 --> 07:29.433
- It was classified information.

07:29.433 --> 07:31.066
- Effected
an overwhelming response...

07:31.066 --> 07:33.333
- Effected an overwhelming
response.

07:33.333 --> 07:35.500
- And empowering
a criminal network.

07:35.500 --> 07:37.133
- And you're empowering
a criminal network.

07:37.133 --> 07:40.100
- It was just a coincidence?
- It was just a coincidence.

07:40.100 --> 07:41.700
- And it takes off.
- It takes off.

07:41.700 --> 07:43.834
- That's why it's powerful?
- That's why it's powerful.

07:43.834 --> 07:45.400
- Same way.
- The same way.

07:45.400 --> 07:47.300
- And you're five years old?
- And I'm five years old.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.266
- 500 a day?
- 500 a day.

07:49.266 --> 07:51.433
- Half a billion dollars.
- Half a billion dollars.

07:51.433 --> 07:52.600
- In cash?
- In cash.

07:52.600 --> 07:53.967
- Divided.
- Divided.

07:53.967 --> 07:55.700
- You wanted more.
- I wanted more.

07:55.700 --> 07:58.133
- So that's your shtick?
- My shtick, yeah.

07:58.133 --> 07:59.967
[clock ticking]

07:59.967 --> 08:01.400
- Moving on.

08:01.400 --> 08:04.133
Our main story tonight
concerns Earth,

08:04.133 --> 08:06.533
the adopted home world of Bjork.

08:06.533 --> 08:08.667
What...are you?

08:08.667 --> 08:10.300
[laughter]

08:10.300 --> 08:14.200
Now, the reason we have to talk
about Earth tonight is this.

08:14.200 --> 08:16.734
- President Trump revealing
his decision to the country,

08:16.734 --> 08:17.934
to the world.

08:17.934 --> 08:19.367
"We're out," he says,

08:19.367 --> 08:21.433
pulling out of
the Paris Climate Accord.

08:21.433 --> 08:24.934
- I was elected
to represent...

08:24.934 --> 08:27.367
the citizens
of Pittsburgh.

08:27.367 --> 08:29.100
Not Paris.

08:29.100 --> 08:30.967
- Okay, first, relax.

08:30.967 --> 08:34.567
No one for a second thought
that you represented Paris.

08:34.567 --> 08:37.033
Partly because everyone knows
Paris is represented

08:37.033 --> 08:39.500
by a smoking French bulldog
who found the first course

08:39.500 --> 08:42.367
to be derivative and jejune.

08:42.367 --> 08:43.667
But it is true.

08:43.667 --> 08:45.667
This week, Trump announced
he would pull out

08:45.667 --> 08:47.400
of the Paris Climate Agreement,

08:47.400 --> 08:48.967
which is hardly surprising.

08:48.967 --> 08:50.934
As a title,
it is so off-brand for him,

08:50.934 --> 08:52.233
it might as well have
been called

08:52.233 --> 08:54.000
"The Globalist Cuck Surrender"

08:54.000 --> 08:56.033
or "A Light Jog."

08:56.033 --> 08:59.834
Yet--yet, pulling out of this
is a huge deal,

08:59.834 --> 09:01.834
and to understand why,
it helps to keep in mind

09:01.834 --> 09:04.533
one key number,
and it's 2 degrees Celsius.

09:04.533 --> 09:06.033
Now, it's a bit of a shorthand,

09:06.033 --> 09:07.667
but the concern is
that if we fail

09:07.667 --> 09:09.900
to limit temperature rise
to that number,

09:09.900 --> 09:13.600
things get very bad
and potentially irreversible.

09:13.600 --> 09:15.300
- Scientists say
we'll likely see

09:15.300 --> 09:17.934
longer droughts
and more intense heat waves,

09:17.934 --> 09:19.367
which could cause
big disruptions

09:19.367 --> 09:20.834
to the world's food supply.

09:20.834 --> 09:23.834
- If we don't start with
rapid emissions reductions

09:23.834 --> 09:25.767
and substantial emissions
reductions,

09:25.767 --> 09:27.567
then we'll pass a danger point

09:27.567 --> 09:30.567
beyond which the consequences
for many people

09:30.567 --> 09:33.900
in countries on Earth
will simply become unacceptable

09:33.900 --> 09:35.867
and eventually disastrous.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.800
- It's true,
and we are not talking about

09:37.800 --> 09:39.300
a fictional apocalypse,

09:39.300 --> 09:41.133
like the one
in the movie "2012."

09:41.133 --> 09:44.000
We're talking about
an actual global disaster,

09:44.000 --> 09:46.433
like the movie "2012."

09:46.433 --> 09:49.166
And the serious danger
may actually be more imminent

09:49.166 --> 09:50.467
than you think.

09:50.467 --> 09:51.934
One estimate says
that to have a good chance

09:51.934 --> 09:54.066
of avoiding
the 2 degree threshold,

09:54.066 --> 09:58.300
human emissions of CO2 should
stay below this level in total.

09:58.300 --> 10:00.667
This is our so-called
carbon budget,

10:00.667 --> 10:02.734
and by the end of last year,
we were estimated

10:02.734 --> 10:05.033
to already be up to here.

10:05.033 --> 10:07.200
And if current emission trends
continue,

10:07.200 --> 10:10.934
we would go above that
critical line in about 20 years.

10:10.934 --> 10:13.333
And that is not a long time.

10:13.333 --> 10:16.400
20 years ago, "South Park"
was on TV,

10:16.400 --> 10:17.934
Foo Fighters were touring,

10:17.934 --> 10:19.900
and Paul Rudd looked like this.

10:19.900 --> 10:24.400
What I'm saying is, 20 years ago
was basically now.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.734
So, the Paris Agreement's
central aim

10:26.734 --> 10:29.100
was to try and keep
our global temperature rise

10:29.100 --> 10:31.000
below that 2 degree threshold,

10:31.000 --> 10:33.867
and to do that, each signaturee
would set their own goals

10:33.867 --> 10:36.266
with a plan to reconvene
every five years

10:36.266 --> 10:38.834
to ideally set
more ambitious targets.

10:38.834 --> 10:40.600
And look, it was not perfect.

10:40.600 --> 10:43.633
Some critics at the time felt
that it did not go far enough,

10:43.633 --> 10:46.567
but the key achievement
was, for the very first time,

10:46.567 --> 10:48.934
getting virtually
the entire world,

10:48.934 --> 10:50.934
including China and India,

10:50.934 --> 10:52.400
to commit to taking action.

10:52.400 --> 10:56.300
It was a historic moment,
and it was celebrated like this.

10:56.300 --> 10:57.934
- The moment
the world agreed

10:57.934 --> 10:59.700
to tackle
climate change.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.500
- [speaking French]

11:02.500 --> 11:04.300
[cheers and applause]

11:04.300 --> 11:06.900
- And so,
the Paris Agreement was born,

11:06.900 --> 11:08.667
and emotions spilled over.

11:08.667 --> 11:11.700
So much so that Laurent Fabius
banged the gavel again.

11:11.700 --> 11:13.667
- [speaking French]

11:13.667 --> 11:16.333
- So, I have been asked
to bang the gavel again.

11:16.333 --> 11:17.734
It's a little gavel,

11:17.734 --> 11:20.900
but I think it can do
great things.

11:20.900 --> 11:23.900
- Okay.
Okay, listen.

11:23.900 --> 11:25.066
Listen, I'll say this.

11:25.066 --> 11:26.633
If you are trying
to convince people

11:26.633 --> 11:28.266
of the gravity of a moment,

11:28.266 --> 11:31.700
maybe don't use such
a humiliatingly shitty gavel,

11:31.700 --> 11:34.600
because it just undercuts
what you're trying to say.

11:34.600 --> 11:36.667
It would not be appropriate
for a judge

11:36.667 --> 11:38.900
to conclude a death penalty case
by saying,

11:38.900 --> 11:41.900
"I hereby sentence you
to hang by the neck until dead.

11:41.900 --> 11:44.767
May God have mercy
upon your soul."

11:44.767 --> 11:46.400
[gavel squeaks]

11:46.400 --> 11:47.667
Right?

11:47.667 --> 11:49.166
[gavel squeaking]
Solemn moment!

11:49.166 --> 11:52.300
Solemn moment for everybody.

11:52.300 --> 11:54.967
So--so why
did Trump announce

11:54.967 --> 11:56.266
that he would pull out
this week?

11:56.266 --> 11:57.400
Well, one clue may have come

11:57.400 --> 11:58.900
during his speech on Thursday

11:58.900 --> 12:01.066
when he actually talked
about that happy celebration

12:01.066 --> 12:02.700
that you just saw,
but seemed to see

12:02.700 --> 12:04.734
something sinister in it.

12:04.734 --> 12:08.200
- The rest of the world
applauded

12:08.200 --> 12:11.900
when we signed
the Paris Agreement.

12:11.900 --> 12:16.166
They went wild.
They were so happy.

12:16.166 --> 12:18.500
For the simple reason

12:18.500 --> 12:20.266
that it put our country,

12:20.266 --> 12:22.033
the United States
of America,

12:22.033 --> 12:24.633
which we all love,

12:24.633 --> 12:28.300
at a very, very big
economic disadvantage.

12:28.300 --> 12:31.066
- What are you talking about?

12:31.066 --> 12:34.000
They were happy because
they secured a landmark victory

12:34.000 --> 12:35.800
for the future of the planet,

12:35.800 --> 12:38.367
you fucking egomaniac!

12:38.367 --> 12:41.834
The whole world is not
secretly conspiring

12:41.834 --> 12:43.734
against the United States.

12:43.734 --> 12:46.800
The only thing the whole world
is secretly conspiring to do

12:46.800 --> 12:49.767
is convince everyone
that there are two Olsen twins.

12:49.767 --> 12:52.233
There is no way.
It is just one girl

12:52.233 --> 12:54.333
moving very quickly
backwards and forwards.

12:54.333 --> 12:55.734
It's an optical illusion.

12:55.734 --> 12:58.233
The Olsen twins thing
is a massive scam,

12:58.233 --> 12:59.767
and the whole world
is in on it,

12:59.767 --> 13:02.266
and the only thing that
I don't quite know yet is why.

13:02.266 --> 13:04.100
But we don't have time
to get into it.

13:04.100 --> 13:06.934
The point is,
if the agreement was a scheme

13:06.934 --> 13:08.533
to hurt American businesses,

13:08.533 --> 13:10.367
you know
who that might be news to?

13:10.367 --> 13:12.400
Many American businesses,

13:12.400 --> 13:15.100
because they were not just
in favor of this agreement,

13:15.100 --> 13:17.066
they even made
a last-ditch attempt

13:17.066 --> 13:19.133
to change Trump's mind.

13:19.133 --> 13:22.033
- 25 companies,
including Microsoft and Intel,

13:22.033 --> 13:23.700
have purchased
a full page ad

13:23.700 --> 13:26.066
in today's
"New York Times" arguing...

13:29.233 --> 13:30.600
- Well, come on, I mean,
he was clearly

13:30.600 --> 13:32.600
never going to be convinced
by an ad

13:32.600 --> 13:33.800
in "The New York Times."

13:33.800 --> 13:35.834
How was he going to see it?

13:35.834 --> 13:38.400
If those companies really wanted
to get his attention,

13:38.400 --> 13:41.900
they needed to talk KFC into
putting out a full bucket ad,

13:41.900 --> 13:44.600
which he would read
on the toilet

13:44.600 --> 13:45.934
while eating chicken

13:45.934 --> 13:47.700
because that, at its core,

13:47.700 --> 13:50.200
is who our president is.

13:50.200 --> 13:51.834
But it turned out--

13:51.834 --> 13:54.266
it turned out that rather than
listening to those companies,

13:54.266 --> 13:55.433
the president was getting advice

13:55.433 --> 13:56.967
from climate change skeptics,

13:56.967 --> 13:58.900
like his EPA chief,
Scott Pruitt,

13:58.900 --> 14:01.767
and human custody hearing,
Steve Bannon.

14:01.767 --> 14:04.700
Although, really,
Trump's actions were in keeping

14:04.700 --> 14:06.600
with a long-held skepticism
that he has

14:06.600 --> 14:07.967
concerning climate change.

14:07.967 --> 14:10.133
He has called it,
"expensive bullshit"

14:10.133 --> 14:12.867
and a hoax created by China,

14:12.867 --> 14:14.900
and he repeatedly
brought that idea up

14:14.900 --> 14:16.934
on the campaign trail,
often before

14:16.934 --> 14:18.834
losing track of what
he was talking about,

14:18.834 --> 14:21.767
and performing real-time
word association.

14:21.767 --> 14:24.433
- China isn't abiding
by anything.

14:24.433 --> 14:26.000
They're buying
all of our coal.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.934
We can't use coal
anymore, essentially.

14:27.934 --> 14:29.867
They're buying our coal
and they're using it.

14:29.867 --> 14:31.800
Now when you talk
about the planet,

14:31.800 --> 14:33.600
it's so big out there.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.100
We're here, they're there.

14:35.100 --> 14:37.100
It's like they're our
next door neighbor, right?

14:37.100 --> 14:38.633
In terms of
the universe.

14:38.633 --> 14:39.767
Miss Universe,
by the way,

14:39.767 --> 14:40.867
made a great deal
when I sold it.

14:40.867 --> 14:43.367
Oh, did I get rich.

14:43.367 --> 14:45.400
That was a great deal.
Oh.

14:45.400 --> 14:47.567
You know, they broke
my choppers on that.

14:47.567 --> 14:49.233
They said, "He talks
about illegal immigration.

14:49.233 --> 14:50.633
We're not gonna put him
on television."

14:50.633 --> 14:52.633
First of all, Univision's
being sued like crazy.

14:52.633 --> 14:54.000
You wouldn't believe it.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.100
And NBC, I made
a great deal with them,

14:56.100 --> 14:57.834
just like an amazing deal.

14:57.834 --> 15:00.500
- Why can't you finish
a thought?

15:00.500 --> 15:03.800
Why can't you finish
a thought?

15:03.800 --> 15:06.533
That is--that was 36 seconds

15:06.533 --> 15:09.533
touching on at least
seven different topics,

15:09.533 --> 15:12.166
including the non-phrase
"broke my choppers,"

15:12.166 --> 15:15.500
and yet, he did not conclude
a single thought there.

15:15.500 --> 15:17.834
A goldfish would hear
that speech and go,

15:17.834 --> 15:20.667
"Hey, hey, hey, focus,
get back to China!

15:20.667 --> 15:22.367
"You were talking about China.

15:22.367 --> 15:23.700
"What is wrong with this--

15:23.700 --> 15:25.800
oh, God, I'm drowning!"

15:25.800 --> 15:27.233
And, look,

15:27.233 --> 15:29.834
when you combine Trump's
lack of attention to detail

15:29.834 --> 15:31.500
with his deep-rooted paranoia,

15:31.500 --> 15:33.333
you get
the wildly misleading reasons

15:33.333 --> 15:36.033
that he cited on Thursday
for pulling out of Paris.

15:36.033 --> 15:38.300
For instance, he seemed
to think the agreement

15:38.300 --> 15:42.300
committed America to shutting
down coal-fired power plants.

15:42.300 --> 15:44.233
- China will be allowed
to build hundreds

15:44.233 --> 15:46.600
of additional
coal plants.

15:46.600 --> 15:49.433
So we can't build
the plants,

15:49.433 --> 15:51.300
but they can.

15:51.300 --> 15:53.500
According to
this agreement.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.200
India will be allowed
to double

15:55.200 --> 15:57.300
its coal production

15:57.300 --> 15:58.800
by 2020.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.000
Think of it.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.433
India can double
their coal production.

16:02.433 --> 16:04.834
We're supposed to
get rid of ours.

16:04.834 --> 16:06.767
- Okay, for the record,

16:06.767 --> 16:08.967
the agreement doesn't
actually ban America

16:08.967 --> 16:10.333
from building coal plants.

16:10.333 --> 16:12.734
It doesn't even contain
the word "coal."

16:12.734 --> 16:15.467
Each--each country sets
its own goals

16:15.467 --> 16:16.867
that it can meet
however it wants,

16:16.867 --> 16:18.967
so that is wrong--
that's just wrong.

16:18.967 --> 16:20.767
As is the fact that
Trump said in his speech,

16:20.767 --> 16:23.533
America would
"continue to be the cleanest

16:23.533 --> 16:26.734
and most environmentally
friendly country on Earth."

16:26.734 --> 16:28.467
Which is objectively untrue,

16:28.467 --> 16:30.467
because over history,
the U.S. has emitted,

16:30.467 --> 16:32.867
by far, more carbon
than any other country,

16:32.867 --> 16:35.000
and we still emit
more per person

16:35.000 --> 16:36.633
than almost any other nation.

16:36.633 --> 16:38.900
So that's like Mark Wahlberg
saying he's going to

16:38.900 --> 16:42.400
continue to be the best dentist
on the planet.

16:42.400 --> 16:44.967
How?
How are you going to do that?

16:44.967 --> 16:47.233
That's not what you are, Mark.

16:47.233 --> 16:49.767
Maybe you could decide
to do that one day,

16:49.767 --> 16:53.100
but you're definitely
not doing it now.

16:53.100 --> 16:56.867
Then there is Trump's concern
over the Green Climate Fund,

16:56.867 --> 16:58.934
which finances projects
in developing nations

16:58.934 --> 17:01.100
helping them adapt
to the impacts of climate change

17:01.100 --> 17:02.834
and reduce their emissions.

17:02.834 --> 17:05.800
Watch now as Trump describes
that fund.

17:05.800 --> 17:07.900
- The Green Fund
would likely

17:07.900 --> 17:09.500
obligate
the United States

17:09.500 --> 17:11.266
to commit

17:11.266 --> 17:15.300
potentially tens
of billions of dollars

17:15.300 --> 17:19.333
of which the United States
had already handed over

17:19.333 --> 17:22.967
one billion dollars.

17:24.166 --> 17:26.667
Nobody else is
even close.

17:26.667 --> 17:28.000
- Okay.
Okay.

17:28.000 --> 17:29.967
Now, to his credit,
that is actually

17:29.967 --> 17:31.967
an impressive amount
of misleading bullshit

17:31.967 --> 17:33.400
in very few words.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.900
In fact, here is everything
that he just said.

17:35.900 --> 17:37.433
Let's break those words down.

17:37.433 --> 17:39.133
First, "The Green Fund."

17:39.133 --> 17:40.734
It's not called
"The Green Fund."

17:40.734 --> 17:42.533
It's called
"The Green Climate Fund."

17:42.533 --> 17:44.900
I know, but still.

17:44.900 --> 17:47.834
Then, "Would likely obligate
the United States

17:47.834 --> 17:49.066
to commit" money.

17:49.066 --> 17:50.166
There is no
enforcement mechanism

17:50.166 --> 17:51.633
in the Paris Agreement.

17:51.633 --> 17:54.700
The U.S. could just easily
refuse to pay the bill,

17:54.700 --> 17:56.700
something Donald Trump
has a lifetime

17:56.700 --> 17:58.266
of practice doing.

17:58.266 --> 18:01.867
As for the "potentially
tens of billions of dollars,"

18:01.867 --> 18:04.567
no, we committed $3 billion.

18:04.567 --> 18:07.567
You can't just inflate three
to "potentially tens."

18:07.567 --> 18:10.567
I can't say that you have
had potentially tens

18:10.567 --> 18:11.967
of failed marriages.

18:11.967 --> 18:14.867
I can only say you've had three,
because you have.

18:14.867 --> 18:16.633
You have had three
failed marriages,

18:16.633 --> 18:19.700
and yes, I am very much
including your current one.

18:19.700 --> 18:21.567
And--and finally--

18:21.567 --> 18:24.834
finally,
"nobody else is even close

18:24.834 --> 18:26.033
to paying more."

18:26.033 --> 18:27.633
That is just
willfully misleading.

18:27.633 --> 18:30.867
While we have given the most
so far in sheer dollars,

18:30.867 --> 18:32.433
we are one
of the richest countries

18:32.433 --> 18:33.967
and one of the top emitters,

18:33.967 --> 18:36.800
and when you rank contributions
as a fraction of GDP,

18:36.800 --> 18:38.667
we are 32nd,

18:38.667 --> 18:40.433
so Trump's description
of the agreement

18:40.433 --> 18:42.567
is so flamboyantly deceptive,

18:42.567 --> 18:44.834
it would have been equally
accurate for him to say,

18:44.834 --> 18:47.333
"Compliance with the
Paris Agreement would likely

18:47.333 --> 18:49.533
"require all ducks
to wear jean shorts,

18:49.533 --> 18:51.633
"and that it would
potentially cost

18:51.633 --> 18:53.600
"each and every American citizen

18:53.600 --> 18:56.400
five fish and a dump truck
full of hamsters."

18:56.400 --> 19:00.667
That would be as true
as what he just said.

19:00.667 --> 19:02.600
And even...
[applause]

19:02.600 --> 19:05.867
Even when he tried to strike
a reassuring tone,

19:05.867 --> 19:08.000
he got it wrong.

19:08.000 --> 19:10.467
- So we're getting out.

19:10.467 --> 19:13.033
But we will start
to negotiate

19:13.033 --> 19:15.834
and we will see if we can
make a deal that's fair,

19:15.834 --> 19:17.767
and if we can,
that's great.

19:17.767 --> 19:20.233
And if we can't,
that's fine.

19:20.233 --> 19:21.567
- Except no.

19:21.567 --> 19:23.400
It is not fine, is it?

19:23.400 --> 19:25.633
Because the leaders
of Germany, France, and Italy

19:25.633 --> 19:26.900
said in a statement,

19:26.900 --> 19:28.667
"We firmly believe
that the Paris Agreement

19:28.667 --> 19:30.700
cannot be renegotiated."

19:30.700 --> 19:33.066
And I would not test
Europe's leaders

19:33.066 --> 19:34.233
when it comes to pulling out

19:34.233 --> 19:35.934
of a major
international agreement.

19:35.934 --> 19:38.700
Britain is trying that bullshit
right now with Brexit,

19:38.700 --> 19:40.333
and maybe you can send
your demands

19:40.333 --> 19:42.500
to same email address
that Europe set up for that.

19:42.500 --> 19:46.433
It's: Lick.OurNuts
@GoFuckYourselves.eu.

19:46.433 --> 19:48.233
So drop them a line.

19:48.233 --> 19:50.533
Drop them a line.
They'll answer.

19:50.533 --> 19:53.667
But I have saved Trump's most
ludicrous misunderstanding

19:53.667 --> 19:55.333
of the agreement for last,

19:55.333 --> 19:57.567
because for a man who cites
the agreement's strict,

19:57.567 --> 19:59.734
onerous, and draconian terms,

19:59.734 --> 20:01.834
what he does not
seem to comprehend

20:01.834 --> 20:05.266
is each nation sets
its own goals, remember,

20:05.266 --> 20:09.867
and more important, the whole
thing is fucking voluntary.

20:09.867 --> 20:11.166
- The agreement,
as a whole,

20:11.166 --> 20:12.533
is not legally binding,

20:12.533 --> 20:14.133
and doesn't
penalize nations

20:14.133 --> 20:16.333
who fail to meet
their commitments.

20:16.333 --> 20:19.367
But it does include a process
designed to shame them

20:19.367 --> 20:21.000
into compliance.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.767
- It's true.
The only penalty was shame.

20:23.767 --> 20:26.967
And unfortunately, this
president is completely immune

20:26.967 --> 20:28.800
to the very concept of that.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.367
If they even tried to shame him
into compliance,

20:31.367 --> 20:33.367
he could just hold up
this photo

20:33.367 --> 20:35.433
of him in a too-short bathrobe

20:35.433 --> 20:37.467
on what appears to be
a child's bed, and say,

20:37.467 --> 20:40.000
"I posed for that.

20:40.000 --> 20:45.233
You cannot hurt me any more
than I've already hurt myself."

20:45.233 --> 20:47.300
And at this point,
you may be thinking,

20:47.300 --> 20:49.000
"Well, hold on,
if it's all voluntary,

20:49.000 --> 20:51.233
then what is the harm
in leaving?"

20:51.233 --> 20:53.200
Well, the truth is,
it's substantial.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.000
And let's start
with just the harm

20:55.000 --> 20:57.233
to America's standing
in the world alone,

20:57.233 --> 20:59.633
because Trump's decision
to leave this agreement

20:59.633 --> 21:02.333
has pissed off almost everyone.

21:02.333 --> 21:03.800
- This morning,
German Chancellor

21:03.800 --> 21:04.900
Angela Merkel
called it,

21:04.900 --> 21:06.266
"Extremely regrettable."

21:06.266 --> 21:08.400
Canadian Prime Minister
Justin Trudeau

21:08.400 --> 21:09.734
called it, "Disheartening."

21:09.734 --> 21:11.700
And the Vatican went further,
saying,

21:11.700 --> 21:15.233
Mr. Trump's decision was
a "disaster for everyone."

21:15.233 --> 21:17.000
- Wow.
Think about that.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.133
We are getting shit-talked
by the Vatican.

21:20.133 --> 21:22.700
And not by Nazi pope--
the cool one.

21:22.700 --> 21:24.266
That's worse.

21:24.266 --> 21:25.967
That is like
getting into a Twitter fight

21:25.967 --> 21:27.467
with the Dalai Lama.

21:27.467 --> 21:29.567
He--he doesn't snap often,

21:29.567 --> 21:33.400
but when he snaps,
he snaps hard.

21:33.400 --> 21:36.300
And look, that reputational harm
can have real costs

21:36.300 --> 21:37.633
for businesses abroad.

21:37.633 --> 21:39.300
One environmental negotiator
who worked

21:39.300 --> 21:40.834
in the George W. Bush
administration

21:40.834 --> 21:42.300
described this decision as...

21:46.000 --> 21:48.000
And that is rough,

21:48.000 --> 21:50.400
because a bad association
can stick with a brand

21:50.400 --> 21:51.667
for a long time.

21:51.667 --> 21:54.633
Just ask Sexual Assault
Pudding Cups,

21:54.633 --> 21:56.600
Double Murder Car Rentals,

21:56.600 --> 22:00.367
or Mr. Touchy's Fresh and Tasty
Pedo Sandwiches.

22:00.367 --> 22:01.800
And then--

22:01.800 --> 22:04.233
then, there is the harm
to American workers.

22:04.233 --> 22:07.100
the very people Trump is
claiming to protect,

22:07.100 --> 22:09.200
Because most of the world
now realizes

22:09.200 --> 22:11.066
that in order to reduce
emissions,

22:11.066 --> 22:13.567
we need to shift to
renewable forms of energy,

22:13.567 --> 22:15.800
and the more a government
encourages that,

22:15.800 --> 22:17.433
the faster it happens,

22:17.433 --> 22:19.133
the quicker costs come down,

22:19.133 --> 22:21.066
and the more likely that
that country is to be

22:21.066 --> 22:22.800
at the forefront
of a whole new industry,

22:22.800 --> 22:24.834
creating countless jobs
in the process.

22:24.834 --> 22:27.433
And you know who knows that?
China.

22:27.433 --> 22:30.500
Or, as Trump would say,
"Chiina!"

22:30.500 --> 22:34.200
Trump just handed
a huge advantage to them.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.934
They've not only canceled plans
to build more than

22:36.934 --> 22:38.800
100 coal-fired power plants,

22:38.800 --> 22:41.967
they're also dramatically
increasing investment elsewhere.

22:41.967 --> 22:45.133
- China plans to spend
more than $360 billion

22:45.133 --> 22:47.567
on renewable energy
by 2020,

22:47.567 --> 22:48.834
which it says will create

22:48.834 --> 22:51.567
at least 13 million
new jobs.

22:51.567 --> 22:52.900
- So you know what,
in a way,

22:52.900 --> 22:54.500
Trump is fulfilling
his campaign promise.

22:54.500 --> 22:56.533
He is creating
millions of new jobs.

22:56.533 --> 22:59.633
He's just doing it
for the wrong fucking country.

22:59.633 --> 23:01.967
And if you want proof that
the jobs of today and tomorrow

23:01.967 --> 23:04.600
are in renewable energy,
France's new president,

23:04.600 --> 23:07.200
Emmanuel Macron, actually issued
a call this week

23:07.200 --> 23:09.433
to America's workforce.

23:09.433 --> 23:11.734
- To all scientists
engineers,

23:11.734 --> 23:13.066
entrepreneurs,

23:13.066 --> 23:15.734
responsible citizens
who were disappointed

23:15.734 --> 23:17.767
by the decision
of the President

23:17.767 --> 23:19.600
of the United States,

23:19.600 --> 23:21.467
I want to say,

23:21.467 --> 23:24.567
that they will find,
in France,

23:24.567 --> 23:27.266
a second homeland.

23:27.266 --> 23:30.100
I call on them,
come,

23:30.100 --> 23:33.467
and work here with us.

23:33.467 --> 23:35.800
- I guess
what he's saying there is...

23:35.800 --> 23:38.367
♪ Be our guest ♪

23:38.367 --> 23:42.433
♪ Be our guest,
put our service to the test ♪

23:42.433 --> 23:44.066
♪ Tie a napkin 'round your-- ♪

23:44.066 --> 23:45.433
You know what--
we don't have time for this.

23:45.433 --> 23:46.834
Stop, stop, we don't--
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

23:46.834 --> 23:49.133
I'm sorry, Lumière.
I'm sorry, Mrs. Pots.

23:49.133 --> 23:51.033
I'm sorry, Cogsworth.
You gotta go.

23:51.033 --> 23:52.867
You gotta go.
Quick, this is my fault.

23:52.867 --> 23:54.533
Get the fuck out of here,
you little fuckers.

23:54.533 --> 23:56.467
[gavel squeaking]
Get out, get out.

23:56.467 --> 23:58.433
But look, the real concern--

23:58.433 --> 24:00.300
the real concern--

24:00.300 --> 24:02.967
the real, real concern here
is that America's absence

24:02.967 --> 24:05.166
from the Paris Agreement
could make other countries

24:05.166 --> 24:07.066
less inclined to meet
their commitments,

24:07.066 --> 24:10.266
and remember, that could quickly
become catastrophic.

24:10.266 --> 24:12.734
And that brings us
to our final point.

24:12.734 --> 24:15.367
Given that we cannot afford
just to wait four years

24:15.367 --> 24:17.767
to vote Trump out of office,
what can be done now?

24:17.767 --> 24:20.367
Well, for starters,
companies need to continue

24:20.367 --> 24:22.066
to step up,
and to their credit,

24:22.066 --> 24:24.600
some, like Walmart
and Bank of America,

24:24.600 --> 24:26.600
have set deadlines
to power themselves

24:26.600 --> 24:28.500
completely with
renewable energy,

24:28.500 --> 24:31.200
and nearly half
of the Fortune 500 companies,

24:31.200 --> 24:33.533
including
Philip Morris International,

24:33.533 --> 24:35.400
have pledged to reduce
their carbon footprints

24:35.400 --> 24:36.667
in the coming years.

24:36.667 --> 24:37.667
That is right.

24:37.667 --> 24:39.367
This is a story where Walmart,

24:39.367 --> 24:41.667
Bank of America,
and Philip Morris

24:41.667 --> 24:43.700
end up being the good guys.

24:43.700 --> 24:46.633
Which just feels
inherently surprising.

24:46.633 --> 24:48.700
It's like I just said,
"Great news, everyone.

24:48.700 --> 24:52.300
"Ebola, ISIS, and that dentist
who shot Cecil the lion

24:52.300 --> 24:54.033
"are gonna save the planet
for us!

24:54.033 --> 24:56.200
"Thanks, guys!
You're the best!

24:56.200 --> 24:58.233
You are the best!"

24:58.233 --> 25:00.967
And look, look, it is
not just companies stepping up.

25:00.967 --> 25:02.467
In the wake of Trump's decision,

25:02.467 --> 25:04.900
multiple governors have
announced their intention

25:04.900 --> 25:06.900
to hold themselves
to the Paris Agreement goals,

25:06.900 --> 25:09.767
as have many mayors,
including, notably,

25:09.767 --> 25:11.734
the mayor of Pittsburgh.

25:11.734 --> 25:14.433
You know, the city that Trump
cited as the reason

25:14.433 --> 25:16.166
he was pulling out
of the agreement.

25:16.166 --> 25:18.734
Their mayor, Bill Peduto,
was pretty clear

25:18.734 --> 25:21.600
about what he thinks
about Trump's decision.

25:21.600 --> 25:23.100
- Pittsburgh is
the poster child

25:23.100 --> 25:26.767
of showing
why the Paris Agreement

25:26.767 --> 25:30.333
is good economics
for the United States,

25:30.333 --> 25:31.934
and what we did today

25:31.934 --> 25:33.800
sets us back decades.

25:33.800 --> 25:35.266
- Wow.

25:35.266 --> 25:38.233
That is pleasantly surprising
on so many levels.

25:38.233 --> 25:40.266
Not the least of which is,
I had always just assumed

25:40.266 --> 25:43.300
that Pittsburgh's mayor was
a Heinz ketchup-drenched

25:43.300 --> 25:44.633
Lombardi trophy.

25:44.633 --> 25:48.033
So we're all learning
a lot of things tonight.

25:48.033 --> 25:50.767
But what this means is that
the onus is now on politicians

25:50.767 --> 25:52.166
at the state and local level

25:52.166 --> 25:54.400
to do what Donald Trump
cannot be bothered to,

25:54.400 --> 25:56.500
an unfortunately,
that means that you now

25:56.500 --> 25:58.500
need to find out
where your mayor,

25:58.500 --> 26:01.433
your governor,
and even your state reps stand

26:01.433 --> 26:02.867
on climate change,
and first,

26:02.867 --> 26:05.066
you'll have to find out
who they are,

26:05.066 --> 26:07.266
but then--then,
you will need to find out

26:07.266 --> 26:09.433
their positions and look,
maybe you'll get lucky.

26:09.433 --> 26:11.166
Maybe yours is great.

26:11.166 --> 26:13.400
Or maybe you live
in Pennsylvania

26:13.400 --> 26:16.066
and you're represented
by state senator Scott Wagner,

26:16.066 --> 26:17.734
who has an interesting theory

26:17.734 --> 26:20.500
for what might be causing
global warming.

26:34.333 --> 26:37.667
- I-I don't even know
where to begin there.

26:37.667 --> 26:41.333
I mean, yes, the Earth does move
closer to the sun every year,

26:41.333 --> 26:43.934
but then, it moves
further away from the sun,

26:43.934 --> 26:47.166
because that is what
a fucking year is.

26:47.166 --> 26:49.967
Our body heat
is not warming the planet,

26:49.967 --> 26:52.233
and we are clearly
not doing the best we can

26:52.233 --> 26:54.567
'cause we keep putting idiots
like Scott Wagner

26:54.567 --> 26:56.266
in positions of power.

26:56.266 --> 26:57.767
And he is not alone.

26:57.767 --> 26:59.467
In North Carolina,
they're considering a bill

26:59.467 --> 27:01.467
that would freeze progress
that that state has made

27:01.467 --> 27:03.000
towards renewable energy.

27:03.000 --> 27:05.700
And one of the people
who would have a vote on that

27:05.700 --> 27:07.800
is state rep Larry Pittman.

27:07.800 --> 27:11.734
So, what is Larry's nuanced take
on climate?

27:34.400 --> 27:36.133
- No, Larry.
No.

27:36.133 --> 27:38.767
The height of hubris
is not opposing climate change

27:38.767 --> 27:40.200
against God's will.

27:40.200 --> 27:42.400
The height of hubris
is, according to Wikipedia,

27:42.400 --> 27:45.000
6'2" and he just
pulled us out

27:45.000 --> 27:46.667
of the Paris Agreement.

27:46.667 --> 27:50.500
So, if your local reps
resemble those guys in any way,

27:50.500 --> 27:51.567
you are going--

27:51.567 --> 27:52.934
you're gonna need to work

27:52.934 --> 27:54.800
to get them out of office
as soon as you can,

27:54.800 --> 27:58.033
and all of this is going to take
work, attention, and energy,

27:58.033 --> 27:59.667
and I know that's not easy.

27:59.667 --> 28:03.367
But Trump may have inadvertently
done us a tiny favor this week,

28:03.367 --> 28:05.166
because the problem
with climate change

28:05.166 --> 28:08.133
is that it's always felt
so abstract, impersonal,

28:08.133 --> 28:09.734
and far off into the future,

28:09.734 --> 28:11.033
and the usual symbols
that we use

28:11.033 --> 28:13.433
don't do much
to fix or help that.

28:13.433 --> 28:15.734
It's either a graph
that's difficult to understand,

28:15.734 --> 28:19.066
or a sad polar bear
on a small piece of ice.

28:19.066 --> 28:21.700
And it's hard to get
emotionally fired up over that.

28:21.700 --> 28:25.533
I don't even know that bear.
He could be a dick.

28:25.533 --> 28:26.967
But--but finally--

28:26.967 --> 28:30.367
finally, this week,
the climate change movement

28:30.367 --> 28:32.500
may have gotten a symbol
to rally around,

28:32.500 --> 28:34.867
because apparently,
it was never quite enough

28:34.867 --> 28:36.867
for us to motivate ourselves

28:36.867 --> 28:39.667
out of love
for this large gassy orb,

28:39.667 --> 28:41.467
but maybe, just maybe,

28:41.467 --> 28:43.700
we can now motivate ourselves
to do something

28:43.700 --> 28:46.600
out of our loathing
of this one.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.800
And now, this.

28:56.200 --> 28:59.000
- We're gonna put
$456 million

28:59.000 --> 29:00.867
to go to an island
of 50 people?

29:00.867 --> 29:03.000
- The bridge to nowhere, right?
- The bridge to nowhere.

29:03.000 --> 29:05.934
- Each person has a purpose.
- Each person has a purpose.

29:05.934 --> 29:08.166
- 24 hours a day?
- 24 hours a day.

29:08.166 --> 29:09.834
- You got greedy?
- I got greedy.

29:09.834 --> 29:12.767
- Bribes and threats.
- Bribes and threats.

29:12.767 --> 29:14.066
- Bribes?
- Bribes.

29:14.066 --> 29:16.200
- Covering up tests?
- Covering up tests.

29:16.200 --> 29:17.667
- Fake urine?
- Fake urine.

29:17.667 --> 29:19.066
- You name it.
- You name it.

29:19.066 --> 29:20.233
- And that's basically
what happened?

29:20.233 --> 29:21.667
- That's basically
what happened.

29:21.667 --> 29:23.967
- Car's in charge.
- Yeah, the car is in charge.

29:23.967 --> 29:25.467
- It's locked.
- It's locked.

29:25.467 --> 29:27.700
- And this is a private home?
- This is a private home.

29:27.700 --> 29:29.300
- We're guinea pigs?
- You're guinea pigs.

29:29.300 --> 29:31.900
- That's an occupational hazard?
- That's an occupational hazard.

29:31.900 --> 29:33.800
- Genuine fake extra virgin
olive oil.

29:33.800 --> 29:36.066
- Genuine fake extra virgin
olive oil.

29:36.066 --> 29:39.300
- So you admit
that you participated

29:39.300 --> 29:41.433
in a system that just
willy-nilly jacked

29:41.433 --> 29:42.800
prices way up?

29:42.800 --> 29:44.700
- Did I say anything
about "willy-nilly"?

29:44.700 --> 29:47.066
- I'm saying "willy-nilly."
I'm saying "willy-nilly."

29:47.066 --> 29:48.433
- I know, I'm not saying
"willy-nilly."

29:48.433 --> 29:49.934
[clock ticking]

29:49.934 --> 29:52.000
- That's our show.
Thank you so much for watching.

29:52.000 --> 29:53.834
See you next week.
Good night.

29:53.834 --> 29:55.934
Come on, guys!
Come on!

29:55.934 --> 29:57.300
[cheers and applause]

29:57.300 --> 30:00.100
Great!
Great!

30:02.100 --> 30:04.133
[bright tone]
