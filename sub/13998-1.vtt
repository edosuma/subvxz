So cute.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.069
Shh.

01:15.280 --> 01:16.918
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

01:32.760 --> 01:33.875
(SCREAMING)

03:16.360 --> 03:18.271
GEORGE:
I know it's kinda strange,

03:18.360 --> 03:20.669
but my grandmother's always
been my best friend.

03:20.760 --> 03:22.034
Seriously.

03:22.960 --> 03:24.598
She'd seen hard times.

03:24.680 --> 03:26.272
Just after
Grandma had triplets,

03:26.360 --> 03:28.749
they tell me my grandfather
axed himself in the head

03:28.840 --> 03:30.034
while chopping wood.

03:30.120 --> 03:32.236
They must think
I was born yesterday.

03:32.320 --> 03:35.551
Uncle Lan calls
it "The Axcident. "

03:35.640 --> 03:36.709
Pun intended.

03:36.800 --> 03:40.315
Mom says he just uses humor
to hide his real feelings.

03:40.400 --> 03:43.676
I don't know.
Must've been
pretty tough for them.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.069
There's a lot of
stories they don't tell me,

03:46.160 --> 03:47.309
but I can feel them.

03:47.400 --> 03:50.198
They're in the dirt
that I walk on when
I visit this place.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.430
Anyway, I'll never
forget all the things

03:52.520 --> 03:54.476
Grandma tried
to pass on to me.

03:54.560 --> 03:56.551
Even the ones
she didn't mean to.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.156
BOY: Harder.
Harder, man.

04:10.960 --> 04:12.109
(GROANS)

04:13.680 --> 04:14.715
(GRUNTS)

04:20.120 --> 04:22.190
MERCY: It's hard
being an outsider.

04:23.000 --> 04:26.959
And you and me come from
a Iong Iine of outsiders.

04:28.520 --> 04:31.318
People Iike to prey
on those who are weak.

04:33.840 --> 04:36.149
But you have to
remember something.

04:37.840 --> 04:40.991
It's not because we are weak.

04:41.080 --> 04:43.275
It's because we are strong.

04:43.920 --> 04:45.911
My grandma taught me that.

04:48.320 --> 04:49.639
What's this?

04:50.960 --> 04:52.029
A warning.

04:52.360 --> 04:55.750
It means if anyone
who Iacks courage

04:55.840 --> 04:57.876
steps foot on her grave,

04:57.960 --> 05:00.474
she'II reach out
and strike them dead.

05:00.960 --> 05:03.952
But she was just
kidding, right?

05:04.040 --> 05:05.632
See for yourself.

05:12.160 --> 05:13.513
(BREATH TREMBLING)

05:15.280 --> 05:16.395
(SNAKE HISSING)
Whoa.

05:16.480 --> 05:17.959
MERCY: Don't move!

05:18.040 --> 05:20.315
Ifyou move, she'II strike.

05:22.840 --> 05:24.717
You have to be brave.

05:24.800 --> 05:26.552
You have to stand up.

05:27.440 --> 05:28.475
Here.

05:29.680 --> 05:32.194
Look her in the eye and play.

05:32.560 --> 05:34.710
What?
Do it.

05:43.800 --> 05:45.950
(PLAYS SLOW-PACED SONG)

06:22.280 --> 06:24.032
She seems to approve.

06:26.040 --> 06:29.237
If you can
stand up to a beast,

06:29.320 --> 06:31.356
you can stand up to a bully.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.194
Wow.

06:57.280 --> 06:58.599

07:02.840 --> 07:04.592

07:18.840 --> 07:19.875

07:19.960 --> 07:21.712

(GROANING MANIACALLY)

07:34.400 --> 07:35.389
Grandma!

07:36.440 --> 07:37.555

07:38.840 --> 07:40.273
(SOFTLY) Georgie...

07:42.280 --> 07:43.872
(BREATH TREMBLING)

07:45.080 --> 07:47.640
MERCY:
I tried everything, Georgie.

07:48.840 --> 07:50.512
I can't cure myself.

07:51.080 --> 07:53.799
It's gonna be okay.
The doctors are coming.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.311
They don't know anything.

07:57.600 --> 08:01.309
(SOBBING)
AII I wanted
was a baby.

08:04.800 --> 08:05.869
Georgie.

08:08.640 --> 08:09.755
He's coming.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.358
You got to get
out of here.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.674
What?
It's for your own good.

08:16.760 --> 08:18.478
Georgie.
I'm not going anywhere.

08:18.560 --> 08:20.118
I can protect you,
Grandma!

08:20.200 --> 08:21.519
I Iove you!

08:22.120 --> 08:23.599
I Iove you too.

08:24.880 --> 08:26.313
More than anything.

08:27.720 --> 08:30.598
But you can't save me.

08:30.680 --> 08:32.955
George? You need to come now.

08:33.039 --> 08:34.109
No, not now!
George!

08:34.200 --> 08:36.668
MERCY: He's coming!
He's coming!

08:41.919 --> 08:43.399
REBECCA:
Did you hear what I said?

08:43.480 --> 08:44.993
Grandma had a stroke?

08:46.960 --> 08:48.029
Is she dead?

08:48.120 --> 08:50.156
Mom said stroke.
Stroke doesn't mean dead.

08:50.240 --> 08:51.832
Might as well be.

08:52.360 --> 08:53.793
GEORGE: Ow! You moron!

08:53.880 --> 08:56.075
Guys, stop it!

08:56.160 --> 08:57.639
(SIGHS)

08:57.720 --> 08:59.836
She's not dead,

08:59.920 --> 09:01.831
but she's in pretty bad shape.

09:04.080 --> 09:05.274
The idiots at
the nursing home

09:05.360 --> 09:07.669
say they won't take
care of her anymore.

09:07.840 --> 09:08.875
Why?

09:09.880 --> 09:11.871
There's been, um...

09:11.960 --> 09:13.188
Problems.

09:13.280 --> 09:14.838
What kind of problems?

09:22.040 --> 09:24.759
So she's gonna Iive
with you now, huh?

09:24.840 --> 09:26.592
I wish.

09:26.680 --> 09:28.671
We're going to stay at
Grandma's place for a while.

09:28.760 --> 09:30.990
Mom says we'II take
care of her there.

09:31.520 --> 09:33.590
What's wrong
with your house?

09:35.640 --> 09:37.756
She wants to die
in hers, huh?

09:43.760 --> 09:46.354
You haven't seen her
since she got sick.

09:46.840 --> 09:48.273
I should have.

09:49.080 --> 09:51.116
It's not your fault,
George.

09:52.640 --> 09:54.631
You care too much.

09:54.720 --> 09:56.517
No.
You do.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.592
That's why
I watch over you.

09:59.680 --> 10:00.999
Georgie, Iook.
You mustn't...

10:01.080 --> 10:02.718
MR. TULLEN: George.

10:03.720 --> 10:05.153
Who you talking to?

10:05.360 --> 10:06.429
The girl next door.

10:06.520 --> 10:09.796
The girl next...
Or God, maybe.

10:09.880 --> 10:11.233
Well, either way
you're supposed
to be in class.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.992
No, I've done my
work for the week.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.832
School policy, George.
You still have to go.

10:14.920 --> 10:16.797
Or what?
You gonna drag me in?

10:22.080 --> 10:24.230
GEORGE:
I'm nothing like my brother.

10:24.320 --> 10:25.878
He hates going to Grandma's.

10:25.960 --> 10:27.712
But he's kinda weird.

10:27.800 --> 10:29.916
He's 15 and only cares
about his cooking

10:30.000 --> 10:31.831
and being a chef one day,

10:31.920 --> 10:33.911
but at least he has direction.

10:34.000 --> 10:35.911
Maybe I'm the weird one.

10:39.920 --> 10:42.593
GEORGE:
Can't you just use ketchup
Iike a normal person?

10:42.680 --> 10:43.999
I'm not a normal person.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.036
I'm a "supertaster."

10:46.120 --> 10:47.189
A what?

10:47.280 --> 10:49.748
Doctor Frankel said
I have a third more
taste buds than most people.

10:49.840 --> 10:51.717
And 100 fewer IQ points.

10:52.720 --> 10:54.790
Guys!
Oh, for God's sakes!

10:54.880 --> 10:55.915
This blows.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.911
Why are we stuck taking care
of Grandma anyway?

10:58.000 --> 10:59.672
Uncle Lan Iives closer.
He works.

10:59.760 --> 11:00.829
And you don't?

11:00.920 --> 11:02.433
What about Aunt Jinny?

11:02.520 --> 11:04.078
She's got to get out
of the nuthouse first.

11:04.160 --> 11:05.673
It's a hospital.

11:06.880 --> 11:08.233
I've got to get
a healthier family.

11:08.320 --> 11:09.992
Why do you have
to be such a jerk?

11:10.080 --> 11:11.593
Aren't you just a Iittle sad?

11:11.680 --> 11:14.831
I mean, it's the Iast time
you're gonna see Grandma.

12:04.640 --> 12:06.551

12:29.840 --> 12:31.159
It's Grandma's favorite Iamp.

12:31.240 --> 12:34.198
(SARCASTIC TONE) Oh, no.
Not Grandma's favorite Iamp.

12:35.920 --> 12:37.717

12:37.800 --> 12:40.155
Yeah, see?
Now you got the haints angry.

12:40.240 --> 12:41.559
That's just
the house settling.

12:41.640 --> 12:44.313
The house has been
here for 150 years.

12:44.400 --> 12:45.833
Don't you think
it's already settled?

12:45.920 --> 12:47.638
Don't try to freak me out.

12:48.480 --> 12:49.993
I don't have to.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.116
You know what happened here.

12:53.200 --> 12:55.760
Grandma was sitting there,
holding Mom.

12:57.200 --> 12:59.839
Grandpa Frank,
he was standing here.

13:00.880 --> 13:03.440
Holding an ax.
Bite me, George!

13:03.520 --> 13:04.794
Everyone knows it
was an accident.

13:04.880 --> 13:07.269
How can you cut yourself
in half by accident,
you moron?

13:07.360 --> 13:09.590
I'm sure it
happens all the time.

13:10.360 --> 13:12.271
Maybe he Iike...

13:12.360 --> 13:13.429
Tripped.

13:15.720 --> 13:17.199
And...

13:17.280 --> 13:18.474
Who cares anyways!

13:18.560 --> 13:19.709
You do.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.750
You think
he's still here.

13:22.840 --> 13:25.593
Can't you see him?

13:35.760 --> 13:37.273

he runs out of head?

13:37.360 --> 13:38.759

hear him coming.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.470

smell is his whiskey

I ought to call
the cops on you, Jim.
The way you scared my boys.

14:14.120 --> 14:17.237

you should've seen
them going at it.

my wife's paintings,

but I do sell
enough to afford
the occasional Iibation.

Libation? Oh.
Means they can get plastered.

14:35.200 --> 14:36.235

a Iittle scary for him?

14:46.520 --> 14:47.509
Oh, hell no.

14:47.600 --> 14:50.672
It's just about a guy
trying to kill
his entire family.

14:50.760 --> 14:52.512
My daddy did it
all the time.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.669

Just my undying Iove and
the pleasure of my company.

15:10.600 --> 15:13.512
I think your wife might have
something to say about that.

So I signed
the discharge papers.
I thought that might help.

(GLASS SHATTERING)

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:56.909
(PANTING)

01:06:00.520 --> 01:06:01.509
Hastur.

01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.032
Grandma, please!
There's got to be
something Ieft ofyou.

01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:07.198
(CONTINUES RECITING)

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:08.954
Hastur.

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.030
Stop! Hastur did this to you!

01:06:13.120 --> 01:06:14.348
This isn't you!

01:06:17.400 --> 01:06:20.790
Forget Hastur!
You're my grandmother!

01:06:20.880 --> 01:06:22.598
You're Mercy!
(WHIMPERING)

01:08:02.880 --> 01:08:03.949
(GRUNTING)

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.629
(GROANING)

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:22.795
Mom.

01:08:40.319 --> 01:08:41.719
(MUFFLED GRUNTING)

01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:18.273
That's what you want?

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:54.509
(GRUNTING)

01:09:56.480 --> 01:09:57.799
(PANTING)

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:11.032
You have to be brave.

01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:12.633
You have to stand up.

01:10:16.480 --> 01:10:17.959
I Iove you, Grandma.

01:10:30.560 --> 01:10:31.788
(PANTING)

01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:40.955
Georgie?

01:10:42.840 --> 01:10:44.717
I Iove you too, Georgie.

01:10:46.200 --> 01:10:47.189
Grandma?

01:11:10.240 --> 01:11:11.559
(GROWLING)

01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.076
GEORGE: The deal
Grandma made came from
a strong need for family.

01:11:36.160 --> 01:11:38.958
The truth is I would've
never been born,
if she hadn't done it.

01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:41.474
So, in a strange way,

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:44.154
even the darkest things
in life can be a blessing.

01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:47.915
But, no matter what
challenges we face,

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.036
we'll face them as a family.

01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.916
Just like Grandma wanted.
