00:23.898 --> 00:28.611
Well, everyone in Winding Way knows
this town used to be full of witches,

00:28.695 --> 00:30.113
good and bad.

00:30.196 --> 00:34.784
A battle of good versus evil
waged for centuries,

00:34.868 --> 00:37.412
until there were very few witches left.

00:37.495 --> 00:42.625
The last two witches hated
Halloween more than anything else,

00:42.709 --> 00:44.502
for all of its candy,

00:44.586 --> 00:48.465
and laughter, and worst of all, children.

00:50.008 --> 00:52.927
I am sure those two witches
are still out there,

00:53.011 --> 00:58.558
and tonight is the first
Witch's Moon in 12 years.

00:58.641 --> 01:00.018
-Hm?

01:00.602 --> 01:05.899
So, stay safe out there, and
make sure you stay away from all witches.

01:12.280 --> 01:13.782
I know you think I'm being funny,

01:13.865 --> 01:17.327
but every legend starts somewhere
and I'm being honest, so just be careful.

01:17.410 --> 01:19.412
Alright, have a good time. Be safe.

01:19.496 --> 01:22.957
Witches! Stay away from witches.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.919
Good try, Ms. Juniper.

01:26.002 --> 01:29.923
But no one believes us.
You saw how long it took my dad to listen.

01:42.435 --> 01:45.271
Witchbuster crew assemble!

02:06.209 --> 02:10.338
I still can't believe
we are in the legend.

02:10.421 --> 02:13.883
We're not just in the legend.
We're legendary!

02:22.142 --> 02:25.019
Time to kick some bad witches to the curb.

03:23.328 --> 03:25.204
Go, go, go.

03:29.125 --> 03:31.252
Piggy, you are on the lookout. Got it?

03:53.733 --> 03:55.151
No sign of them.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.490
One, two, three.

04:12.752 --> 04:14.587
I hear somebody. Attack!

04:37.860 --> 04:38.820
Wait, wait!

04:39.529 --> 04:40.363
Dad?

04:40.446 --> 04:42.073
It's just you guys.

04:44.200 --> 04:45.243
Sweetheart.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.042
"Willa Ward."

04:55.712 --> 04:59.257
"Willa, thank you so much for the amulet."

04:59.340 --> 05:01.884
"We would have loved
to have you for tea again,

05:01.968 --> 05:04.053
but we have a town to take over."

05:04.971 --> 05:07.890
"Hatefully yours, the Winkle sisters."

05:11.602 --> 05:12.687
They're getting away!

05:12.770 --> 05:13.771
Come on!

05:23.531 --> 05:27.452
Frozen words quickly zoom
Put a stop to those two brooms!

05:27.535 --> 05:30.288
-We got 'em!

05:32.957 --> 05:35.543
Oh, no. There go the witches…

05:36.127 --> 05:38.046
And the amulet.

05:42.925 --> 05:44.719
-What happened?
-They got away!

05:44.802 --> 05:48.222
Okay, okay. No-nobody panic.
Uh… What's plan B?

05:48.806 --> 05:49.807
Plan B?

05:49.891 --> 05:51.350
Do we even have a plan A?

05:53.227 --> 05:54.062
What was that?

05:54.145 --> 05:57.065
Somebody's still here.
Come on, we gotta go check it out.

05:57.148 --> 05:59.650
-Secret door, okay?

05:59.734 --> 06:01.319
A secret door?

06:01.402 --> 06:03.237
It won't budge.

06:03.321 --> 06:06.074
We gotta get in there somehow.

06:06.908 --> 06:07.992
Dad?

06:08.076 --> 06:09.160
Don't freak out.

06:09.243 --> 06:10.411
Why?

06:11.370 --> 06:14.624
It seems weird at first, but it's
gonna be great. You'll love it. Watch.

06:18.086 --> 06:19.337
Oh, I love it.

06:19.420 --> 06:20.588
What do you think, Dad?

06:21.631 --> 06:22.673
Pretty cool, huh?

06:23.257 --> 06:24.300
Say something?

06:24.383 --> 06:26.803
Get him together, Ms. Juniper. We'll brb.

06:26.886 --> 06:28.054
Back in a flash.

06:28.554 --> 06:30.807
-Neil?
-Come on, guys.

06:31.599 --> 06:32.725
Come back to us, Neil.

06:36.854 --> 06:37.688
Guys.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.149
Come on.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.193
-But they…
-Yeah.

06:42.276 --> 06:43.111
But you…

06:43.194 --> 06:44.445
-Hm.

06:44.529 --> 06:47.490
It is a secret door! Let's go.

06:55.581 --> 06:56.791
Halloween is the worst.

06:56.874 --> 07:00.461
"Ooh, I like candy. Can I have some candy?
Do you want to put candy in my bag?"

07:00.545 --> 07:02.463
Ding dong. "Hi, candy." Ugh!

07:02.547 --> 07:05.883
I cannot wait to crash this party.

07:05.967 --> 07:08.386
We've been spotted. Everyone act natural.

07:08.469 --> 07:10.847
-Oh, you're, uh, a little early.

07:11.639 --> 07:12.932
Incredible costumes though.

07:14.267 --> 07:18.396
Is this a trio of
costume-contest-winning witches, Wyatt?

07:18.479 --> 07:24.986
I have a feeling your little contest party
will be upstaged by something bigger.

07:25.945 --> 07:26.779
What?

07:27.613 --> 07:30.450
Enjoy the Howl while it lasts, Principal,

07:30.533 --> 07:33.536
because we heard
the Witches of Winding Way are back,

07:33.619 --> 07:36.205
and that they're badder than ever.

07:38.332 --> 07:40.376
-Just a rumor.

07:40.460 --> 07:42.795
-Just something we heard.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.638
They are really selling it.

08:02.523 --> 08:03.399
Be careful.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.318
They probably left booby traps.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.113
What do you think
they'll do to us?

08:09.197 --> 08:11.115
Petrify us? Turn us into toads?

08:12.033 --> 08:14.744
-Make our bones vanish?
-Make our bones vanish?! Ugh.

08:15.786 --> 08:17.246
Is it getting hot in here?

08:23.085 --> 08:25.922
Don't stare at the eyeballs, Dad.
It's rude.

08:26.005 --> 08:27.256
I'm not staring.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.968
I have eyelids, I can blink.
These guys, no eyelids. They're staring.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.762
Okay. Manners.

08:32.845 --> 08:34.055
-Let's go.
-Okay.

08:38.392 --> 08:39.393
Willa!

08:39.477 --> 08:40.311
Fink?

08:40.394 --> 08:43.105
I-I-I'm in here. Down here.

08:43.189 --> 08:45.316
-Fink!

08:45.399 --> 08:47.068
Willa!

08:47.151 --> 08:50.404
Oh, thank goodness you're here.
Y-Y-You just saved my life.

08:50.488 --> 08:54.408
The witches would have left me here
forever. I was doomed. I was minced meat.

08:54.492 --> 08:57.161
I was chopped--
Wait a second. Why are you here?

08:57.912 --> 08:59.830
We need to know
what the witches are up to.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.375
It's bad, Willa. I-I-It's really bad.

09:02.458 --> 09:04.335
I wish your mom was here to help.

09:04.418 --> 09:06.963
She knew how to solve every problem.

09:07.046 --> 09:11.175
She really was the best witch
a familiar could ever ask for.

09:11.759 --> 09:16.055
What? You were my mom's familiar?
Why didn't you say anything?

09:16.138 --> 09:19.684
Oh, I-I-I wanted to,
but it was never safe.

09:20.268 --> 09:21.644
What happened to her?

09:21.727 --> 09:22.562
I…

09:23.396 --> 09:24.230
Well…

09:24.981 --> 09:28.109
-Let me just show you.

09:33.322 --> 09:35.741
The witches called your mom
to discuss a truce

09:35.825 --> 09:38.411
between the good and bad witches
of Winding Way.

09:39.287 --> 09:43.291
Willow believed in the power of goodness,
so she agreed to go,

09:43.791 --> 09:46.711
but Wilma and Wanda
were only after her amulet,

09:46.794 --> 09:48.296
fooling Willow to get her there,

09:48.379 --> 09:51.173
and when Willow
refused to hand the amulet over,

09:51.257 --> 09:53.134
they said they'd come after you.

09:53.884 --> 09:58.472
You will never touch my daughter.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.683
They shouldn't have done that.

10:05.438 --> 10:06.647
Willow?

10:07.356 --> 10:09.191
-Willow!

10:09.275 --> 10:10.943
On our way there that day,

10:11.027 --> 10:14.280
I promised your mom
that if anything happened to her,

10:14.363 --> 10:17.658
I would do my best
to make sure you got the amulet.

10:18.743 --> 10:20.786
The amulet!

10:22.413 --> 10:24.040
So that's what I did.

10:24.749 --> 10:27.501
I put it there in your bassinet
all those years ago.

10:27.585 --> 10:28.586
Your mom knew,

10:28.669 --> 10:30.755
when you came of age,
you'd have the strength

10:30.838 --> 10:33.758
to put an end to the battle
between good and bad witches forever.

10:33.841 --> 10:36.302
Then your dad gave it to you
for your twelfth birthday.

10:37.178 --> 10:40.056
I thought coming of age was 12-ish. No?

10:40.139 --> 10:41.849
That's why they showed up.

10:41.932 --> 10:44.852
They felt the amulet's energy
when you put it on.

10:45.353 --> 10:48.314
They've been searching for it
for over a decade.

10:48.397 --> 10:52.109
I've been trying to
steer them away all this time.

10:52.193 --> 10:56.155
So you stayed here
with those awful witches to keep me safe?

10:56.739 --> 10:59.909
Yeah. I'd do anything for your mom.

11:00.493 --> 11:01.661
If they have the amulet,

11:01.744 --> 11:05.373
they're going to try to finish what they
failed to do at the last Witch's Moon.

11:05.456 --> 11:07.249
Oh, no.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.167
What?

11:08.250 --> 11:10.086
-The Halloween Howl.
-Yes!

11:10.169 --> 11:13.214
With everything and everyone
they hate in one place,

11:13.297 --> 11:16.092
they could turn
Winding Way into Witches Way,

11:16.175 --> 11:18.719
a place where there's no more goodness.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.889
-We're not gonna let that happen.

11:33.776 --> 11:36.153
Hello? Who-who goes there?

11:37.321 --> 11:38.864
Hello, Pete.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.241
Oh, you again!

11:42.618 --> 11:45.663
What are you unwelcome witches doing here?

11:45.746 --> 11:47.790
And who is this?

11:47.873 --> 11:51.335
Hi, I'm Wyatt,
the new Warlock of Winding Way.

11:51.419 --> 11:53.212
And we're here for supplies.

11:53.295 --> 11:54.797
Shoplifting spree.

11:54.880 --> 11:58.509
Take whatever you want,
just leave me alone.

11:59.635 --> 12:00.678
Don't mind if we do.

12:10.938 --> 12:14.233
So we're clear, Dad,
you and Ms. Juniper go set up at the Howl.

12:14.316 --> 12:16.569
We'll track down the bad witches.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.946
-Copy.
-Good luck, girls.

12:20.197 --> 12:22.825
Wait. How are we supposed to find them?

12:23.367 --> 12:25.744
Mm… We need to cover more ground.

12:27.329 --> 12:29.874
-And I know just the person to help us.

12:29.957 --> 12:32.168
Well, not a person. Come on!

12:33.127 --> 12:36.755
Put those by the DJ booth
and put that by the dance floor.

12:36.839 --> 12:39.758
Let's keep big energy everybody,
we've got lots of things to…

12:39.842 --> 12:41.385
-To do.

12:42.678 --> 12:43.929
Witches are coming.

12:44.013 --> 12:48.100
-I repeat, witches are coming.
-Witches are coming! Witches are coming!

12:48.184 --> 12:50.769
Oh, what an entrance! That's the spirit.

12:50.853 --> 12:53.772
-Everyone must go home. The party's over.
-Go home!

12:53.856 --> 12:55.107
-The party is over!
-No, no.

12:55.941 --> 12:58.235
No, it's not! No, it's not.

12:58.319 --> 13:01.822
Everyone keep doing
what it is you're doing!

13:01.906 --> 13:05.910
What are you doing?
Of course witches are coming.

13:05.993 --> 13:07.620
So are zombies and werewolves.

13:07.703 --> 13:11.457
-Okay, Principal McKay, you need to stop--
-No.

13:11.540 --> 13:15.085
The Halloween Howl is
our town's most popular tradition,

13:15.169 --> 13:17.630
not to mention our biggest fundraiser.

13:17.713 --> 13:20.132
It is happening.

13:20.216 --> 13:25.262
You two can either get in
the spirit of the season or get gone.

13:27.848 --> 13:30.935
Well, that didn't quite go as planned.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.144
No, it did not.

13:36.315 --> 13:37.525
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

13:37.608 --> 13:41.195
You may not have noticed
in gym, but cardio is not my strong suit.

13:43.197 --> 13:44.532
Why didn't we get a ride?

13:47.284 --> 13:50.162
Come on, come on!
We've got a town to save.

13:56.001 --> 13:58.712
It looks like
the bad witches got here first.

13:59.296 --> 14:00.297
Oh, no.

14:00.381 --> 14:02.007
Pete! Where are you?

14:02.091 --> 14:04.843
Pete, come out! Your backup's here.

14:07.763 --> 14:09.807
Return the forms that we came from.

14:12.726 --> 14:15.145
Willa. Willa? Is that you?

14:15.229 --> 14:17.064
Pete, what happened?

14:17.147 --> 14:21.277
When I refused to help the bad witches,
they, they wrecked up the place

14:21.360 --> 14:23.821
and vowed to run me out of town.

14:23.904 --> 14:27.408
Soon Winding Way won't be safe
for nice witches like you.

14:27.992 --> 14:31.120
This is all my fault,
but we're going to fix it.

14:31.203 --> 14:34.248
Hey, y-y-you can't mean fight them?

14:34.331 --> 14:36.125
Tooth, paw, and claw if we have to.

14:36.208 --> 14:40.838
We just need to find them,
but we've got a lot of ground to cover.

14:40.921 --> 14:45.050
Hm. Well I-I-I do have
one thing that might help you.

14:46.135 --> 14:48.929
In fact, more like three things.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.854
Are these… for us?

14:58.230 --> 14:59.398
-Whoa.

14:59.481 --> 15:00.482
Cool!

15:02.693 --> 15:03.527
Thank you.

15:03.611 --> 15:04.612
Thank you.

15:05.195 --> 15:09.116
Huh. Now there's just
one last thing you'll need.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.037
-Whoa!

15:13.120 --> 15:15.998
Now you're ready.

15:16.081 --> 15:17.416
Thank you, Pete.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.252
Yes, yes. Go…

15:20.336 --> 15:22.838
-Wisters!
-Wisters!

15:36.560 --> 15:41.273
-I thought I told you two, no more--
-Oh, Principal McKay.

15:41.357 --> 15:45.319
You know what? You were right.
Things got out of hand.

15:45.402 --> 15:49.406
Well, it was a classic case of
Halloween hysteria, hm?

15:49.490 --> 15:51.825
Well, I've been there.

15:51.909 --> 15:56.497
Yes, well, we want to be right here
to make sure this is the best party ever.

15:57.081 --> 16:00.334
Yeah. We love the Howl, Principal McKay.

16:00.417 --> 16:02.419
I even brought
some freebies from the store.

16:03.253 --> 16:04.546
Well, that's more like it.

16:04.630 --> 16:07.758
You think
you might be able to do me a solid

16:07.841 --> 16:11.345
and uh, set that up in town square?

16:11.428 --> 16:16.183
This is
ex-exceedingly generous of you, Mr. Ward.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.394
You shouldn't have.

16:18.477 --> 16:21.397
-You got it.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.107
We gotta witchproof this party!

16:23.190 --> 16:24.108
Okay.

16:24.191 --> 16:30.114
I hereby commit to doing my very best
to not eat all the ammunition.

16:30.197 --> 16:31.198
Oh!

16:31.281 --> 16:33.993
Piggy, on the other hand,
I can't make any promises for.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.203
He is his own guinea pig,
aren't ya?

16:36.286 --> 16:37.121
Drop it.

16:40.457 --> 16:43.877
And three steps, sprinkle, sprinkle,

16:43.961 --> 16:46.630
35 degrees over here,

16:46.714 --> 16:50.134
and we are set to go.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.176
-Wanda?
-Hm?

16:51.260 --> 16:52.928
-I was thinking.
-Uh-huh?

16:53.012 --> 16:56.265
-What with it being a special occasion…
-Mm-hm? Oh.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.642
That we should finally break out

16:58.726 --> 17:01.353
our take-over-the-world outfits
you've been talking about?

17:01.437 --> 17:03.689
-Get out of my head.
-Get out of mine.

17:03.772 --> 17:05.024
You get out of my head.

17:05.107 --> 17:06.650
I won't, I'll live there forever.

17:14.116 --> 17:15.200
What the…

17:16.160 --> 17:17.161
Seriously?

17:17.703 --> 17:18.537
No?

17:18.620 --> 17:20.914
No. Witch, please.

17:26.837 --> 17:29.048
Okay. Now I have an idea.

17:29.131 --> 17:31.717
-Let's take over this town.
-Yes.

17:39.141 --> 17:40.350
-Neil.

17:40.434 --> 17:45.355
You're not planning on firing those
candy cannons at the children, are you?

17:45.439 --> 17:49.485
Oh, Principal McKay, you, uh…
Nobody's told you?

17:50.486 --> 17:54.490
Yeah, this is, uh, uh…
We're preparing for the really big show.

17:55.074 --> 17:56.533
What are you talking about?

17:56.617 --> 18:00.412
-W-W-What we do is--
-It's a live stage show.

18:00.496 --> 18:04.541
So kind of think of it as like a…
an improvisational theater.

18:05.584 --> 18:11.632
Really think of it as the final act of the
legends of the Witches of Winding Way.

18:11.715 --> 18:16.345
You know, I don't mean to boast,
but I used to do a little improv myself.

18:16.428 --> 18:18.931
That's great, Principal McKay,

18:19.014 --> 18:21.934
uh, because you're going to be part of it.

18:22.017 --> 18:25.145
Uh, you're going to be the, uh, star of…

18:25.229 --> 18:27.898
-There's a scene where, um, uh…
-Oh, go on.

18:27.981 --> 18:29.900
-Ms. Juniper, can you set the scene?
-Sure.

18:29.983 --> 18:34.613
Um, well, the bad witches
are coming here tonight.

18:34.696 --> 18:37.866
-Mm-hm. Okay.
-The people of Winding Way must stop them.

18:38.575 --> 18:41.620
-I will spread the word.
-Yes.

18:41.703 --> 18:44.623
-You two put the "boo" in boo-yah.
-Oh, come on.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.708
-Straight from the theater.

18:52.881 --> 18:55.968
I've spotted the dad.

18:56.051 --> 19:00.597
Hm. I don't like the looks of that.

19:00.681 --> 19:04.059
So the witches are going to be
flying in from somewhere.

19:04.143 --> 19:07.479
When I give the signal,
we launch the candy cannons.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.273
What if it's not enough?

19:09.356 --> 19:12.860
Well, then we've still got
the candy traps, and…

19:13.944 --> 19:15.445
the candy launchers.

19:15.946 --> 19:18.615
We've got to warn the witches.

19:18.699 --> 19:21.118
-What if those don't work?
-I don't know.

19:21.910 --> 19:23.871
I just hope Willa gets here in time.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.456
-Okay.

19:26.540 --> 19:30.043
You heard that cat.
It's up to us to save everyone.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.004
It's Wyatt!

19:33.046 --> 19:36.341
-Wyatt! Don't do this!
-Hey! Wait!

19:48.020 --> 19:50.814
Okay, Wyatt, where are the witches?

19:50.898 --> 19:52.316
And why are you helping them?

19:52.399 --> 19:56.987
Because more magic equals more awesome,
and this town is so boring.

19:57.070 --> 19:59.990
I can't believe I used to think
you were kind of cool.

20:00.073 --> 20:02.659
Hey, I am cool, and I'll be even cooler

20:02.743 --> 20:06.038
when I'm a super powerful warlock
tossing fireballs all over the place.

20:06.121 --> 20:09.499
Do you seriously want
a town run by Wanda and Wilma?

20:09.583 --> 20:11.251
They're so weird, Wyatt.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.419
Doesn't matter.

20:12.502 --> 20:17.257
It's too late to stop it now, and soon,
even you three won't be able to stop me.

20:17.341 --> 20:20.052
We kicked your butt before,
and it's three against one.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.220
We have the advantage.

20:21.303 --> 20:24.640
Well, actually, it's three against three.

20:29.645 --> 20:30.938
Surprise.

20:31.521 --> 20:32.606
-Run!

20:37.694 --> 20:40.697
And you have an unfair disadvantage…

20:40.781 --> 20:41.698
You're trapped.

20:41.782 --> 20:43.242
Give me my amulet!

20:43.951 --> 20:46.787
Eyes on the prize next time, girls.

20:46.870 --> 20:52.251
This bad boy over here is what we
like to call a choice bit of misdirection.

20:52.334 --> 20:54.753
Just hand over the potions and the brooms,

20:54.836 --> 20:57.631
or we'll be forced to turn you into,

20:57.714 --> 21:01.468
I don't know,
a boneless pile of quivering jelly.

21:03.595 --> 21:05.889
Now you three sit tight,

21:05.973 --> 21:10.060
while the grown-ups
finish what we started.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.273
It's finally time.

21:21.071 --> 21:22.072
Stick around.

21:22.155 --> 21:25.534
It's going to be quite a show.
