Welcome to new orleans, grace.

01:18.487 --> 01:21.154
I can't believe you're working
the day after flying in.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.656
You haven't even unpacked yet.

01:22.750 --> 01:25.325
Grace, are you ready?

01:25.477 --> 01:27.644
Absolutely.

-You have a big day.

use a little lagniappe.

01:36.488 --> 01:38.263

01:38.415 --> 01:39.823

-Like bourbon in your coffee.
-Alexis!

01:41.602 --> 01:43.677

04:23.597 --> 04:25.655

crush on him in college,

04:25.674 --> 04:27.491

-No, I didn't.

in almost every class together

04:37.778 --> 04:39.836

at the end of senior year,

04:42.098 --> 04:43.765
We maybe had
a little romantic spark,

04:43.859 --> 04:45.692
But then
my parents' accident happened

04:45.844 --> 04:47.286

-Yeah.

didn't want to bother him

04:58.874 --> 05:00.782

And then moved to
frankfurt and okay, I see now.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.864

that you sent me.

to you, please?

why don't you help yourself

To some pralines
in the living room?

07:47.968 --> 07:49.526
They're my specialty.

07:49.544 --> 07:50.969
-Thank you.
-So good.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.124
I'm sure I don't know why

07:57.144 --> 07:58.810
Are you looking at
your grandma like that.

07:59.037 --> 08:01.037
You didn't tell me
I was going to have a partner.

08:01.130 --> 08:02.964
Didn't I?
Must have slipped my mind.

08:02.983 --> 08:04.724
Grandma, you are the smartest
woman I've ever met.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.710
Nothing slips your mind.

08:06.803 --> 08:08.487
I thought you could
use some help, that's all.

08:08.714 --> 08:11.064
And she seems like
the perfect person to give it.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.733
For the record, I am capable
of doing this on my own.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.496
And if I hate the designs
you two come up with, you can.

08:17.647 --> 08:20.499
But right now, you have
to at least try it with grace.

08:20.726 --> 08:23.293
This is what I want.

08:24.746 --> 08:26.153
Okay, I'll try.

08:26.248 --> 08:29.399
-[loretta sighs]
-I'll try.

08:29.492 --> 08:31.659
-Good.
-Grace--she's a good architect.

08:31.753 --> 08:34.012
We're just very different.

08:34.163 --> 08:36.014
You know what they say
about opposites, don't you?

08:42.581 --> 08:44.748
Oh, oh, oh.

08:44.766 --> 08:49.510
I'm so sorry.
They are just so good.

08:49.530 --> 08:53.014
Of course. No one can
resist a miss loretta treat.

08:53.108 --> 08:55.258
That's a praline promise.

08:55.277 --> 08:57.594
Why don't you and anthony
take a look around my house

08:57.687 --> 08:59.596
And start coming up
with some ideas?

08:59.689 --> 09:01.114
Don't you want
to brief us first?

09:01.208 --> 09:03.024
I'll be brief.

09:03.118 --> 09:04.876
Make the house look phenomenal.

09:06.438 --> 09:07.212
Okay.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.843
-Should we, uh--
-let's start upstairs.

09:15.447 --> 09:17.013
Oh, okay.

09:20.952 --> 09:22.227
Anthony: So the house
was built in 1888,

09:22.454 --> 09:25.230
And it hasn't been updated
since the 1920s,

09:25.457 --> 09:27.048
So you can see
how badly this reno is needed.

09:27.142 --> 09:28.808
The first thing I want to do

09:28.902 --> 09:30.143
Is probably blow out
these walls down here.

09:30.237 --> 09:31.795
Oh no, no, no, no.

09:31.888 --> 09:33.296
This is a beautiful,
historic home.

09:33.315 --> 09:34.981
You can't just
go blowing out walls.

09:35.133 --> 09:36.741
Well, up until
a few minutes ago,

09:36.968 --> 09:38.410
We weren't doing
anything, were we?

09:38.561 --> 09:39.986
[laughing]

09:40.080 --> 09:43.397
Who got coal in his stocking?

09:43.491 --> 09:46.084
You're afraid of me stealing
your spotlight, aren't you?

09:46.311 --> 09:47.660
Grace, no one's
going to steal my spotlight.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.162
Oh, yeah, no one but me.

09:49.314 --> 09:50.830
It's just like old times.

09:50.982 --> 09:52.665
-Old times?
-Mm-hm.

09:52.818 --> 09:54.593
Back when I used to
beat you at everything.

09:54.820 --> 09:56.243
You think you could
stop teasing me long enough

09:56.263 --> 09:57.578
For us to get some work done?
