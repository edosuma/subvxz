41:31.619 --> 41:33.142
I'M NOT GONNA DROP EVERYTHING

41:33.142 --> 41:34.796
JUST BECAUSE YOU SUDDENLY
DECIDED TO COME BACK.

41:34.796 --> 41:37.059
W-WE'LL TALK. THERE ARE
SOME OTHER STIPULATIONS--

41:37.059 --> 41:39.061
EASY STUFF.
I'M SURE WE CAN FIGURE THEM OUT.

41:39.061 --> 41:41.673
BUT NONE OF THISAPPLIES.
THIS--

41:41.673 --> 41:45.764
I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE HEARING ME, JANE.

41:45.764 --> 41:47.983
YOU ARE ON U.S. SOIL NOW,

41:47.983 --> 41:50.246
I AM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT,
AND I AM TELLING YOU

41:50.246 --> 41:52.422
THAT THATIS A NAPKIN.

41:54.033 --> 41:55.121
THIS...

41:55.121 --> 41:56.905
IS THE DEAL.

41:56.905 --> 41:59.038
TAKE IT...

41:59.038 --> 42:00.300
OR LEAVE IT.

42:02.302 --> 42:03.651
I'LL LEAVE IT.

42:03.651 --> 42:05.392
OH, THAT'S TOO BAD.

42:05.392 --> 42:07.133
YOU MADE A MISTAKE,
BUT, HEY...

42:07.133 --> 42:08.787
[footsteps approach]KIM?

42:09.788 --> 42:11.006
AGENT FISCHER.

42:11.006 --> 42:12.138
KIM?

42:12.138 --> 42:14.488
AGENT FISCHER.

42:16.446 --> 42:19.058
AGENT FISCHER.

42:19.058 --> 42:21.060
[Abbott sighs]
MR. JANE

42:21.060 --> 42:23.845
WILL BE GOING
TO A DETENTION SUITE.

42:23.845 --> 42:26.369
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.
I'LL MAKE THE ARRANGEMENTS.

42:26.369 --> 42:28.284
OH, YEAH, I'M NOT FUSSY.

42:28.284 --> 42:30.025
IF YOU HAVE ONE WITH A VIEW,
I'LL TAKE IT.

42:30.025 --> 42:31.766
IF NOT, UH, WHATEVER,

42:31.766 --> 42:34.073
AS LONG AS I CAN MAKE
SOME TEA.

42:35.422 --> 42:37.555
WHO IS SHE,
AND WHAT IS A DETENTION SUITE?

42:37.555 --> 42:39.992
DON'T WORRY, LISBON.
IT'S ALL UNDER CONTROL.
