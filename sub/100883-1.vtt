01:07.600 --> 01:09.203
Welcome to Navojoa.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.509
Little brother.

01:17.345 --> 01:19.746
Jack.

01:19.813 --> 01:21.848
Weren't at your hotel,
so I figured this'd be

01:21.916 --> 01:23.750
the next place to find you.

01:23.817 --> 01:25.585
Right, well, you could
have waited for me to come

01:25.652 --> 01:26.988
and find you when I
was ready to talk,

01:27.054 --> 01:30.324
but that's not
your style, is it?

01:30.391 --> 01:34.594
I know this isn't something
you wanted to do, coming here.

01:34.661 --> 01:36.030
On the contrary,

01:36.097 --> 01:37.564
this used to be one of
the most incredible

01:37.630 --> 01:39.467
junkyards I ever saw.

01:39.532 --> 01:42.769
Now look at it...

01:42.836 --> 01:44.105
there's almost nothing left.

01:45.839 --> 01:48.075
You know what I meant.
Ryan, I...

01:48.142 --> 01:50.277
- I meant...
- I know what you meant.

01:53.613 --> 01:55.548
What kinda trouble you in?

02:29.116 --> 02:30.617
I'm all in.

02:36.123 --> 02:38.192
Whew...
how much you need?

02:40.494 --> 02:43.696
You know, man, you don't have
to throw it back in my face.

02:43.763 --> 02:46.367
I know you've bailed
me out before...

02:46.434 --> 02:48.369
I know.
I get it.

02:48.436 --> 02:49.403
That's not what I meant.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.837
Yeah.

02:50.905 --> 02:52.173
Listen, I just wanna
help you get right.

02:52.239 --> 02:53.873
So if you need cash,
I'll get some...

02:53.941 --> 02:55.608
No, it's not cash,
it's not cash.

02:55.675 --> 02:57.011
Cash won't do this time.

02:58.546 --> 03:00.214
Well, then what is it?

03:12.725 --> 03:15.262
- Four ladies.
- Oh!

03:22.203 --> 03:28.641
Diamonds are not
a girl's best friend.

03:40.687 --> 03:44.158
How is it that you're such
a fuck-up

03:44.225 --> 03:46.293
when your brother Jack is out
there winning all the time?

03:46.360 --> 03:47.760
What is that like?

03:51.932 --> 03:53.666
You guys still close?

03:56.203 --> 03:57.404
Well, you're gonna need him.

03:59.806 --> 04:00.941
We need him.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.177
Need him for what?

04:04.478 --> 04:05.778
We need him to run the Outlaw.

04:09.416 --> 04:10.351
Davie, listen, man...

04:11.885 --> 04:15.089
it's out of the question.
Look, I can...

04:15.156 --> 04:18.559
I will pay you back every
last dollar that I owe you.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.060
I will.

04:28.469 --> 04:30.104
It's not about a choice.

04:30.171 --> 04:33.207
Actually, it is a choice...

04:35.943 --> 04:38.312
do I kill you now,

04:38.379 --> 04:40.747
or do I give you a chance
to redeem yourself.

04:42.449 --> 04:45.252
Jack thinks as highly
of me as you do.

04:46.786 --> 04:49.390
He will never race the Outlaw.

04:51.358 --> 04:53.027
Not even to save the life
of his little brother?

04:56.096 --> 04:59.433
Man, there's no way.

04:59.500 --> 05:00.767
He won't do it.

05:03.770 --> 05:05.973
Are you willing to bet
your life on this?

05:09.143 --> 05:12.812
There's a race,
it's called the Outlaw.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.847
This year it's Mexico to L.A.

05:14.915 --> 05:16.584
God, you got
some balls, man...

05:16.650 --> 05:19.587
some fucking balls, coming
down here, asking me that.

05:19.653 --> 05:21.222
I retired, man.

05:21.288 --> 05:23.224
I got outta the race game,
and I've stayed there.

05:23.290 --> 05:24.525
Yeah, you think
I don't know that?

05:24.592 --> 05:26.026
Get your stuff.

05:26.093 --> 05:28.462
I'm driving you back
to the States myself.

05:28.529 --> 05:30.664
I'm in a really bad
place with this guy, man,

05:30.730 --> 05:32.266
a really bad place.

05:32.333 --> 05:35.369
He has people...
people that will find me.

05:37.104 --> 05:38.973
I can't be looking
over my shoulder

05:39.039 --> 05:40.374
for the rest of my life.

05:45.546 --> 05:46.513
Get in the car.

06:35.029 --> 06:36.597
It looks like
I'm the oldest guy here

06:36.664 --> 06:40.100
by about at least
15 years, huh?

06:40.167 --> 06:42.269
At least you got experience
on your side.

06:42.336 --> 06:44.438
Or I'm too stupid to know
I shouldn't be here.

06:52.313 --> 06:53.247
Is that the guy?

06:55.115 --> 06:56.717
Good evening, racers.

06:56.784 --> 06:59.453
Welcome to this year's
running of the Outlaw 1000.

06:59.520 --> 07:02.056
This year's race starts
in Navojoa,

07:02.122 --> 07:03.991
and it's 1,000 miles
to Los Angeles.

07:04.058 --> 07:06.760
The winner...
$5 million.

07:06.826 --> 07:08.962
I don't care how you get there,

07:09.029 --> 07:10.731
but it has to be on four wheels,

07:10.798 --> 07:12.966
and there's three checkpoints
that you must hit along the way.

07:14.368 --> 07:16.036
The checkpoints
have been preprogrammed

07:16.103 --> 07:17.738
into your GPS systems.

07:17.805 --> 07:19.573
Is that all of them?

07:21.308 --> 07:23.210
Oh!

07:23.277 --> 07:26.580
Ladies and gentlemen, we have
royalty in the house tonight...

07:26.647 --> 07:28.382
Mr. Jack Tyson.

07:28.449 --> 07:30.651
This motherfucker done
won more races

07:30.718 --> 07:32.419
than any redneck in NASCAR.

07:32.486 --> 07:34.421
Did you point a gun
at my brother?

07:36.957 --> 07:39.026
As a matter of fact, I did...

07:39.093 --> 07:40.160
and here you are.

07:40.227 --> 07:41.962
Jack, Jack, wait, wait, wait!

07:42.029 --> 07:43.430
Your brother owes me
a lot of money.

07:43.497 --> 07:47.101
But if you win this race,
the debt will be paid.

07:47.167 --> 07:48.936
Nelson, did you not explain?

07:49.002 --> 07:50.704
Yeah, I did.
Come on.

07:50.771 --> 07:52.172
Come on!

07:52.239 --> 07:54.808
This is why you don't
meet your heroes.

07:54.874 --> 07:56.477
Put a muzzle on
that fucking dog!

08:06.387 --> 08:07.688
What were you trying
to prove back there?

08:07.755 --> 08:09.289
Get your hands off of me.

08:09.356 --> 08:11.291
You can't mess around
with a guy like Davie.

08:11.358 --> 08:13.893
Don't tell me you're
afraid of a grown-ass man

08:13.961 --> 08:15.429
that goes by the
name of "Davie."

08:15.496 --> 08:16.663
Shut the fuck up!

08:16.730 --> 08:18.332
Fuck you, man!

08:20.334 --> 08:21.468
Hey...

08:21.535 --> 08:22.936
what would have happened
if I wouldn't

08:23.003 --> 08:24.138
have come down here,
huh, Nelson?

08:24.204 --> 08:26.106
How would that have looked?

08:26.173 --> 08:27.775
You'd take a bullet
from this asshole?

08:27.841 --> 08:29.309
Why?

08:30.611 --> 08:32.479
What do you want me
to tell you, man?

08:32.546 --> 08:36.316
I kept losing, all right, and
he was the only game in town.

08:36.383 --> 08:39.520
He saw you coming, man, and
he gave you just enough rope.

08:39.586 --> 08:41.488
Guys like that?

08:41.554 --> 08:43.890
They can spot the real
compulsive gamblers a mile away.

08:43.957 --> 08:45.325
Shut up, man.

08:45.392 --> 08:46.794
When are you gonna
get it together, man?

08:46.860 --> 08:48.095
Seriously.

08:49.663 --> 08:52.232
What are you even
still doing in Mexico?

08:52.299 --> 08:54.501
You had the money to get out.

08:57.337 --> 08:58.539
I didn't have it.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.110
You didn't have it?

09:04.978 --> 09:07.381
Is there a problem here?

09:07.448 --> 09:09.216
You know what?

09:09.283 --> 09:10.851
You could tell Davie
to take it all

09:10.919 --> 09:12.820
and shove it right up his ass.

09:12.886 --> 09:14.655
Him and I, we're not done.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.890
Not even close.

09:16.957 --> 09:20.060
Ooh, charming, Jack.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.198
Why don't you take this anger

09:24.264 --> 09:27.534
and channel it into
winning this race?

09:59.867 --> 10:01.668
Drivers ready!

10:01.735 --> 10:03.337
Nina!

10:03.403 --> 10:05.639
You about to find out about
these eight seconds.

10:05.706 --> 10:08.408
Still not as quick as your
boyfriend in bed, though.

10:11.178 --> 10:14.114
This ain't no
rally race, homeboy.

10:42.776 --> 10:44.111
Three...

10:47.047 --> 10:48.782
two...

10:52.020 --> 10:53.820
Go!

11:32.492 --> 11:35.095
Jack is still one
hell of a driver.

11:35.162 --> 11:36.630
Shame he's such
a fucking prick.

11:38.265 --> 11:40.434
I bet it's killing you
on the inside,

11:40.500 --> 11:42.202
not putting any money
on him to win.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.238
Go to hell, Davie.

11:45.305 --> 11:47.075
I'll tell you what...

11:47.140 --> 11:49.409
I'll float you 100k.

11:49.476 --> 11:52.379
I mean, what kind of guy
would I be to not let you

11:52.446 --> 11:54.314
get in on the action?

12:04.058 --> 12:05.192
All right.

12:13.067 --> 12:15.435
How come there's not much
riding on Jack up there?

12:15.502 --> 12:17.537
Maybe they know something
we don't know.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.741
Well, that's crap.

12:20.807 --> 12:23.176
What's with this
hidden camera shit?

12:23.243 --> 12:25.113
Paranoid much?

12:25.178 --> 12:27.314
Why don't you just shut the
fuck up and watch the race?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.240
Fucking Jack Tyson
needle dick.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.278
Who the fuck is Jack Tyson?

13:24.738 --> 13:27.240
Yeah, where the fuck
you at, Grandpa?

13:56.003 --> 13:57.404
Fuck.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.807
Let's go.

14:00.874 --> 14:03.510
Shit, oh, shit!

14:05.079 --> 14:06.513
Fucking Hot Wheel driver.

14:15.089 --> 14:16.389
Come on.

14:19.760 --> 14:21.795
I got you.
No way, not today.

14:25.632 --> 14:26.968
Not today, come on, let's go.

15:17.118 --> 15:18.618
Welcome to checkpoint one.

15:18.685 --> 15:19.853
You are?

15:21.189 --> 15:23.323
Jack.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.825
So this is it, huh?

15:26.693 --> 15:29.796
Well, congratulations on
first place for checkpoint one.

15:36.003 --> 15:37.905
Mr. Davie?

15:37.972 --> 15:42.375
I've got a Mr. Jack in the
restaurant, first place.

15:44.045 --> 15:45.879
Si, senor, will do.

15:47.414 --> 15:50.417
He'd like to congratulate you
on your first-place win.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.053
Ah. Yeah, sure.

15:54.021 --> 15:55.655
So Davie owns this place?

15:55.722 --> 15:58.758
Si, he's owned it
for many years.

16:03.597 --> 16:04.731
For the winner.

16:14.041 --> 16:17.711
And once all the other
drivers are here,

16:17.777 --> 16:21.015
lunch will be served, okay?

16:32.626 --> 16:34.861
Goddamn it, fuck.

17:10.263 --> 17:13.633
Hola, race fans,
it's your girl, Six-Speed Nina,

17:13.700 --> 17:18.204
and I am here at
El Tesoro Escondido,

17:18.271 --> 17:19.973
in the town of Hermosio.

17:20.040 --> 17:22.842
And it's our first stop
in the Outlaw 1000.

17:22.910 --> 17:24.979
And you'd better believe
I'll be chowing down

17:25.046 --> 17:27.281
on some bean burritos
before our race moves

17:27.348 --> 17:29.716
to our next stop,
Puerto Penasco.

17:31.751 --> 17:34.121
Can I ask you what
the hell you're doing?

17:34.188 --> 17:36.790
Well, I'm posting to all
my followers on Instagram.

17:36.856 --> 17:39.193
You know, checking in
every stop of the way,

17:39.260 --> 17:41.228
letting them ride shotgun
all the way to L.A.

17:41.295 --> 17:44.165
Or letting the cops know where
we're going all the way to L.A.

17:44.231 --> 17:45.865
You don't wanna go
around broadcasting

17:45.933 --> 17:47.567
where you're going
unless you want to get

17:47.634 --> 17:49.469
pulled over and arrested.

17:49.536 --> 17:50.737
The Mexican police
don't follow me.

17:50.804 --> 17:52.739
Well, they will be
before long.

17:52.806 --> 17:55.542
Says here you retired...

17:55.608 --> 17:56.944
like three years ago.

17:58.379 --> 18:01.115
And the last time you won
something was longer than that.

18:04.986 --> 18:07.787
So what's Davie
inviting you for?

18:07.854 --> 18:09.556
Your guess is as good as mine.

18:09.622 --> 18:10.724
But when I buzzed
you back there,

18:10.790 --> 18:12.360
you didn't know what to do,

18:12.426 --> 18:15.096
so you don't have any
street reflexes whatsoever.

18:15.162 --> 18:16.629
But I guess that's
the difference between racing

18:16.696 --> 18:18.132
on a closed track
against a clock

18:18.199 --> 18:19.467
versus having another man
in the next lane?

18:19.532 --> 18:20.734
Is that right?

18:20.800 --> 18:22.470
Let me guess...

18:22.535 --> 18:25.072
the real skill comes from
doing 90 in a pedestrian zone

18:25.139 --> 18:27.141
and losing control
and plowing into a family

18:27.208 --> 18:29.377
who's coming home from
having ice cream?

18:29.443 --> 18:33.414
Is that how you hone
your "street reflexes," bro?

18:33.481 --> 18:34.448
Watch your mouth, Grandpa.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.150
Easy, guys... easy.

18:40.587 --> 18:42.356
It's okay, kid.

18:42.423 --> 18:45.292
You know what, I was pretty
stupid when I was your age, too.

18:45.359 --> 18:47.627
Yeah, when was that?
Before the car was invented?

18:48.895 --> 18:50.031
Something like that.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.301
I'll see you out there.

18:54.368 --> 18:56.870
Sure... just not for long.

19:07.814 --> 19:09.649
Good luck, guys.

19:59.500 --> 20:00.935
Who's there?

20:02.136 --> 20:04.505
Can you show me that
10-second car now?

20:04.572 --> 20:05.805
Eat a dick, Nina.

20:06.806 --> 20:08.175
Whatever.

20:39.540 --> 20:41.108
Gotcha!

20:41.175 --> 20:42.543
Bitch!

20:58.092 --> 20:59.126
Ah!

21:17.978 --> 21:19.280
- Drive! Drive! Drive!
- What's going on?

21:31.091 --> 21:33.427
Jack has really come
through so far.

21:33.494 --> 21:36.829
Yeah, for you, but nobody
else is betting on him.

21:36.896 --> 21:39.899
One point eight mil?
Really?

21:39.967 --> 21:42.536
Man, you said it yourself...

21:42.603 --> 21:43.904
he's retired.

21:43.971 --> 21:46.407
Been outta the race game
for a while.

21:46.473 --> 21:48.909
These other kids are hot
in the circuit right now.

21:48.976 --> 21:50.578
They're street punks.

21:50.644 --> 21:54.881
They've got more recognition,
recent popularity...

21:54.949 --> 21:56.951
things your brother
does not have.

21:59.353 --> 22:01.854
Gillian, make the transfers
to the winners.

22:01.922 --> 22:05.559
Alert the losers
that stage two is starting.

22:05.626 --> 22:07.461
Okay.

22:11.731 --> 22:14.034
I'm gonna need your name,
or you're gonna need to get out.

22:14.101 --> 22:15.336
Is that a threat?

22:15.402 --> 22:16.937
You don't know anything
about me.

22:17.004 --> 22:18.372
Maybe I don't do well
with threats.

22:18.439 --> 22:19.640
Maybe I'm about to
stab you in the face

22:19.707 --> 22:20.708
and take this goddamn thing?

22:20.773 --> 22:23.344
Oh, yeah?
All right.

22:23.410 --> 22:26.313
Just wanted to know who I was
in the car with, that's all.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.084
Name's Bianca.

22:31.318 --> 22:33.020
Hello, Bianca.

22:33.087 --> 22:36.223
You mind telling me
what happened back there?

22:36.290 --> 22:38.525
You wanna tell me
who you are first?

22:38.592 --> 22:40.461
It's only polite.

22:40.527 --> 22:42.263
Now we're being polite.

22:42.329 --> 22:45.466
All right, fine...
my name's Jack.

22:45.532 --> 22:47.167
Jack Tyson.

22:47.234 --> 22:48.235
Jack?

22:48.302 --> 22:50.704
You're the guy...
oh, thank God.

22:50.770 --> 22:52.606
You know who I am?

22:52.673 --> 22:53.941
You're Davie's golden boy.

22:54.008 --> 22:56.176
This whole thing hinges on you.

22:56.243 --> 22:57.777
Oh, you don't know how
happy I am right now

22:57.844 --> 22:59.779
to have found you so quickly.

22:59.846 --> 23:01.548
Wait, you've
been looking for me?

23:03.050 --> 23:04.884
I need you to take me to L.A.

23:04.952 --> 23:07.820
I know I can get there
with you driving.

23:07.887 --> 23:09.957
Davie's probably gonna try some
messed-up stuff on the way up,

23:10.024 --> 23:12.259
but he can't afford
to lose you.

23:13.327 --> 23:15.429
He won't do anything to you.

23:15.496 --> 23:17.164
Well, okay, hold on.

23:17.231 --> 23:19.099
You're gonna have to
start from the beginning.

23:20.934 --> 23:22.069
What is this all about?

23:23.971 --> 23:25.606
These...

23:25.673 --> 23:27.374
I took them from his safe.

23:34.615 --> 23:36.250
Oh!

23:46.393 --> 23:47.428
Oh, no...

23:47.494 --> 23:49.363
No, no, no, no.

23:49.430 --> 23:51.031
Fuck.

23:57.971 --> 24:00.574
Fuck!

24:39.879 --> 24:41.515
Yeah?

24:41.582 --> 24:42.916
Davie?

24:42.983 --> 24:44.718
Davie, they took them.
They're gone.

24:44.785 --> 24:46.487
Are you fucking serious?

24:46.553 --> 24:50.124
Yeah, but I tried to stop him,
but he was too fast, and I...

24:50.190 --> 24:51.992
I'm really sorry!

24:52.059 --> 24:54.395
Look, you stupid bitch, you'd
better fucking find it, right?

24:54.461 --> 24:56.363
- I fucked up, I know I...
- Now!

24:56.430 --> 24:58.198
I don't know what to do,
I'm sorry.

24:58.265 --> 25:00.567
Stupid fucking bitch!

25:00.634 --> 25:02.536
God-fucking-damn it!

25:05.005 --> 25:06.340
Who the hell is that?

25:09.643 --> 25:10.778
Bianca.

25:10.844 --> 25:12.212
Wait, you know this chick?

25:21.755 --> 25:22.756
So, we there yet?

25:22.823 --> 25:24.258
Not even close.

25:24.324 --> 25:25.959
We're about an hour
out of Suaqui Grande,

25:26.026 --> 25:27.761
which, now that I think about
it, is probably a good place

25:27.828 --> 25:30.197
for me to drop you off at
a bus station or somewhere.

25:30.264 --> 25:33.634
What? No, you can't!
Please...

25:33.700 --> 25:35.235
Listen to me, I'm gonna
drop you off

25:35.302 --> 25:37.037
at a bus or train station.

25:37.104 --> 25:38.639
You'll be safer and you'll
get to where you're going

25:38.705 --> 25:40.507
a lot quicker and easier
than with me, all right?

25:40.574 --> 25:42.676
He's looking for me at the bus
station, and the airport.

25:42.743 --> 25:44.745
His men are everywhere,
he's gonna kill me!

25:44.812 --> 25:45.946
Don't you understand that?

25:47.347 --> 25:49.750
Because of what's
on those drives?

25:49.817 --> 25:51.018
What's on 'em?

25:51.084 --> 25:52.921
- Evidence.
- Evidence of what?

25:52.986 --> 25:56.256
Of all of Davie's past,
present, and future crimes.

25:56.323 --> 25:58.025
Evidence that's gonna
get that bastard

25:58.091 --> 26:00.427
out of our lives for good, and
put him away where he belongs.

26:00.494 --> 26:02.796
Listen, what exactly
are on those drives?

26:02.863 --> 26:04.631
All of his ledgers...

26:04.698 --> 26:06.300
every record he's kept,

26:06.366 --> 26:09.102
dating back since he started
keeping them digitally.

26:10.671 --> 26:11.605
Oh, boy.

26:11.672 --> 26:13.373
Did they get anything?

26:13.440 --> 26:14.842
As a matter of fact, they did.

26:14.909 --> 26:16.243
Was it anything important?

26:16.310 --> 26:19.446
Shut the fuck up, Nelson.

26:19.513 --> 26:20.949
They arrived
at the checkpoint,

26:21.014 --> 26:23.717
the safe was broken into.

26:23.784 --> 26:25.552
Hey...

26:25.619 --> 26:28.021
you know why you're a
worthless, piece of shit loser?

26:28.088 --> 26:29.389
Because you never
win at anything.

26:31.391 --> 26:33.160
Sit down when
I'm talking to you!

26:40.634 --> 26:42.904
You can call it luck;

26:42.971 --> 26:45.639
I call it karma.

26:45.706 --> 26:48.408
You come from shit,
all you can be is shit.

26:48.475 --> 26:52.446
But when you give a shit,
you get shit.

26:53.881 --> 26:57.518
My father was nothing,

26:57.584 --> 26:59.853
but look at me.

26:59.921 --> 27:02.556
Now I'm a multimillionaire

27:02.623 --> 27:06.260
who can kill anybody
at any time.

27:07.361 --> 27:10.999
I own this town, I own the cops,

27:11.064 --> 27:12.466
I own everything
you fucking see.

27:12.533 --> 27:14.701
Man, you don't own the cops.

27:14.768 --> 27:16.270
If they knew you were
cutting them out of the race,

27:16.336 --> 27:18.071
you'd be fucked.

27:20.407 --> 27:23.176
Your brother,
he's a piece of shit

27:23.243 --> 27:26.079
because you share
the same fucking blood.

27:26.146 --> 27:30.317
Your father was a piece
of shit.

27:31.618 --> 27:33.453
And well...

27:33.520 --> 27:38.292
Your mother was a stupid bitch
for fucking a piece of shit.

27:39.326 --> 27:41.228
Look at you...

27:41.295 --> 27:44.032
the way you dress,
the way that...

27:44.097 --> 27:47.801
everything about you says shit.

27:49.436 --> 27:51.238
You'll always be
a fucking loser.

27:54.241 --> 27:55.809
I'm not here by choice.

27:55.876 --> 27:58.645
No one who does anything
for Davie is by choice.

27:59.880 --> 28:01.815
Once they have their hooks in,

28:01.882 --> 28:03.784
you can't get out,
no matter what you do.

28:06.787 --> 28:09.023
Sounds like you're
talking from experience.

28:09.089 --> 28:12.859
You know, you don't look much
like a thief or a safe-cracker.

28:12.927 --> 28:14.394
So tell me something...

28:14.461 --> 28:16.330
how'd you know where
the drives were?

28:16.396 --> 28:18.799
I used to work for Davie.

28:18.865 --> 28:20.367
I was his girlfriend.

28:20.434 --> 28:22.302
I knew the safe code.

28:22.369 --> 28:25.606
Ah... girlfriend.

28:25.672 --> 28:28.475
Now, that's just
fan-fucking-tastic.

28:28.542 --> 28:30.011
Oh, boy...

28:30.078 --> 28:32.746
let me guess, you broke up
with him, he wanted you back,

28:32.813 --> 28:35.049
you stole the drives, and now
everything's up in the air.

28:35.115 --> 28:36.617
Davie's gonna kill me

28:36.683 --> 28:38.452
if I don't deliver those
drives to Los Angeles.

28:38.518 --> 28:41.722
He could kill anybody
without a thought.

28:43.156 --> 28:44.858
I could never kill anybody...

28:44.926 --> 28:46.928
couldn't even think about that.

28:46.995 --> 28:48.528
You ever kill anybody, huh?

28:51.365 --> 28:52.733
I didn't think so.

28:54.668 --> 28:56.004
He's sick.

28:56.070 --> 28:57.838
This is payback.

28:57.905 --> 28:59.773
And look, whatever
Davie has on you,

28:59.840 --> 29:02.643
whatever reason he has for
forcing you to race for him,

29:02.709 --> 29:05.013
it all goes away once
I get this evidence

29:05.079 --> 29:06.480
to the U.S. attorney.

29:06.546 --> 29:11.151
We can put Davie away
for good, you and me.

29:11.218 --> 29:12.586
We can do this.

29:13.955 --> 29:16.156
No one else will do it, Jack.

29:24.831 --> 29:27.101
I underestimated
this little bitch.

29:27.167 --> 29:29.436
She chose Jack because
she knows I need him to win.

29:30.404 --> 29:32.305
I don't understand.

29:32.372 --> 29:33.607
She's trying to get
over the border

29:33.674 --> 29:35.542
with the things
she stole from me.

29:35.609 --> 29:37.310
She thinks Jack is her ticket.

29:37.377 --> 29:38.812
She's so fucking wrong.

29:39.981 --> 29:41.715
What did this chick
steal from you?

29:41.782 --> 29:42.984
Shut the fuck up.

29:43.051 --> 29:45.318
Policia!

29:48.122 --> 29:49.823
I'll take care of this.

29:57.531 --> 29:58.933
The fuck do you want,

29:59.000 --> 30:00.600
banging on my door like
the fucking police?

30:00.667 --> 30:03.137
Senor Davie...

30:10.978 --> 30:12.479
Vamanos!

30:15.215 --> 30:17.217
Vamos!

30:18.385 --> 30:19.519
Motherfuckers!

30:19.586 --> 30:21.788
- Yeah...
- You done fucked up!

30:23.290 --> 30:24.891
Your whole family's gonna
die behind this shit!

30:33.101 --> 30:35.302
- David!
- Gillian!

30:41.441 --> 30:42.576
Damn it!

30:48.281 --> 30:49.951
Did they just arrest Davie?

30:50.017 --> 30:52.220
Those sons-of-bitches aren't
taking him to any jail.

30:52.285 --> 30:54.488
Bastards!

30:57.390 --> 31:00.494
They pick today to do this,
of all days.

31:00.560 --> 31:03.830
It's their mistake, their error.

31:03.897 --> 31:05.499
And this stays quiet.

31:05.565 --> 31:08.835
As far as anybody knows,
Davie is still right here.

31:19.147 --> 31:20.280
Oh, it's Gillian.

31:21.149 --> 31:23.184
Gillian, what up?

31:23.251 --> 31:26.254
Garcia took Davie.
I need you to bring him back.

31:26.319 --> 31:27.687
All right, understood.

31:27.754 --> 31:29.190
I'm sending the car, be ready.

31:29.257 --> 31:30.624
We're ready, we're ready.

31:30.690 --> 31:32.459
- What's up?
- La policia took Davie.

31:32.526 --> 31:33.995
Let's go.

31:37.231 --> 31:39.066
Fuck!

31:39.133 --> 31:40.433
Get ready to fuck some shit up.

32:24.511 --> 32:26.948
Here we go.

32:27.014 --> 32:28.615
All right.

32:31.685 --> 32:33.120
Come on, come on, come on.

32:42.096 --> 32:43.363
Mick, you ass!

32:47.467 --> 32:48.936
Woo!

32:49.003 --> 32:51.471
Just a little bumpin', dumplin'!

32:58.812 --> 33:00.948
Not in this lifetime, Nita!

33:02.149 --> 33:03.717
Woo!

33:23.137 --> 33:24.471
Shit!

33:31.245 --> 33:32.479
Thank you, Jack!

33:32.545 --> 33:34.681
Motherfucking fuck, fuck!

33:35.917 --> 33:38.451
How do you like that,
you little snotty prick?

33:38.518 --> 33:40.620
Jesus, did you just hit
that guy on purpose?

33:40.687 --> 33:43.523
Now we're on track.
That's how we do it.

33:56.736 --> 33:58.672
Are we really going
118 miles per hour?

33:58.738 --> 33:59.839
Yeah, that's the point
of racing...

33:59.907 --> 34:01.675
to go really, really fast.

34:01.741 --> 34:03.077
Well, if you're trying
to scare the crap outta me,

34:03.144 --> 34:04.178
it's working.

34:18.025 --> 34:21.429
Hola.
Dos tacos, por favor.

34:21.494 --> 34:24.297
Très tacos y una cerveza.

34:26.300 --> 34:27.600
Que?

34:27.667 --> 34:29.103
Those tacos aren't
coming, sweetie.

34:29.170 --> 34:30.804
You're gonna take us to him
if you wanna

34:30.870 --> 34:32.039
keep your fucking head,
do you understand me?

34:32.106 --> 34:33.572
Let's go.

35:00.401 --> 35:02.736
Why are we stopping?

35:02.802 --> 35:04.372
Because I need
something to eat.

35:04.438 --> 35:05.940
You should do the same.

35:11.711 --> 35:13.214
We'll take it to go.

35:13.280 --> 35:15.316
We gotta make that next
checkpoint by morning.

35:15.383 --> 35:16.951
How many stops we have
until we get to L.A.?

35:17.018 --> 35:18.885
Two more checkpoints
to the finish line.

35:18.953 --> 35:24.624
Hola, I will have the cemita
milanesa y una Coca-Cola.

35:24.691 --> 35:26.793
Huevos rancheros,
salsa picante.

35:28.661 --> 35:30.663
Breakfast for dinner
kinda gal, huh?

35:30.730 --> 35:32.166
Since I was a little girl.

35:32.233 --> 35:34.035
But when you grew up
poor like we were,

35:34.101 --> 35:36.404
the concept of breakfast for
dinner goes out the window.

35:36.470 --> 35:39.206
You either eat what's in
front of you, or you go hungry.

35:40.508 --> 35:42.709
Fair enough.

35:42.776 --> 35:44.744
Plus I just really like
huevos rancheros.

35:44.811 --> 35:46.579
And you think that's
the best thing to take

35:46.646 --> 35:48.482
in a car on the go?

35:48.548 --> 35:50.784
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
get any yolk or salsa

35:50.850 --> 35:52.585
on your precious little car.

35:52.652 --> 35:54.288
Okay, so listen...

35:54.355 --> 35:57.058
let's say your whole plan
works when you get to L.A.

35:57.124 --> 35:59.427
You said Davie has
people everywhere.

35:59.493 --> 36:01.262
What makes you think
he's not gonna come after you

36:01.328 --> 36:02.862
after he goes down?

36:02.930 --> 36:04.898
The U.S. attorney's giving
me a new identity.

36:05.765 --> 36:07.201
Witness protection?

36:09.602 --> 36:12.473
And everything you have leads
the feds to his front door?

36:12.540 --> 36:14.241
Yes.

36:14.308 --> 36:16.876
So you can stop trying to dump
me on the side of the road.

36:16.944 --> 36:18.745
So that's what you meant
when you said

36:18.812 --> 36:20.381
everything hinges on me.

36:20.448 --> 36:24.118
Oh, yeah... you're very
important to both of us.

36:24.185 --> 36:27.354
I need you to help me get
this information to L.A.

36:27.421 --> 36:30.157
He needs you to win to keep
the criminals and cartels

36:30.224 --> 36:33.394
he works for happy and earning
millions of commissions.

36:33.461 --> 36:35.029
He won't go after you.

36:41.102 --> 36:42.802
I gotta run to the bathroom.
I'll meet you at the car.

36:42.869 --> 36:44.604
Yeah, hurry up.
We gotta go.

37:08.895 --> 37:12.433
Hola, mija.
We're gonna have some fun!

37:12.500 --> 37:13.800
Ah!

37:13.867 --> 37:15.035
Gimme the drives!

37:18.606 --> 37:20.740
I know that you have them!

37:28.848 --> 37:31.152
How about this?

37:31.218 --> 37:32.752
No! No!

37:40.427 --> 37:41.661
Ah!

37:45.865 --> 37:47.268
[ shouting

37:58.312 --> 37:59.846
Thanks for the drive,
you son of a bitch.

37:59.914 --> 38:01.949
Puta bitch!

38:09.689 --> 38:10.857
Jack, we gotta go!

38:10.925 --> 38:11.992
Bianca, what the hell...

38:12.059 --> 38:14.295
Get in the fucking car!

38:29.143 --> 38:31.078
You okay?
Is anything broken?

38:31.145 --> 38:33.080
I don't think so.

38:33.147 --> 38:34.881
Oh, man.

38:34.949 --> 38:38.785
He was looking
for the thumb drives... these.

38:41.488 --> 38:42.755
Here, put this on your lip,
it'll help with the swelling.

38:42.822 --> 38:44.325
Thanks.

38:44.391 --> 38:45.758
Ow!

38:47.394 --> 38:49.630
Son of a bitch had his
knee digging into my back,

38:49.697 --> 38:51.265
I thought he was gonna break it.

38:53.901 --> 38:55.569
I'll be fine.

38:55.636 --> 38:57.705
It's nothing compared to what
Davie used to do to me.

39:04.078 --> 39:06.113
It's not my car,
it's your boyfriend's.

39:06.180 --> 39:08.482
What the hell did I say
about saying that, Jack?

39:10.883 --> 39:12.819
What are you doing?

39:12.885 --> 39:16.123
How did he know
you were here, huh?

39:21.996 --> 39:23.796
He can see in the car?

39:25.232 --> 39:26.367
Gotcha.

39:27.735 --> 39:29.603
Damn it!

39:29.670 --> 39:31.005
I think he got you.

39:39.779 --> 39:43.917
We have... a complication.

39:47.721 --> 39:48.922
Let's go, puto.

39:52.792 --> 39:54.128
Get the fuck over there.

39:55.862 --> 39:58.865
Por favor, no!
Por favor!

39:58.932 --> 40:00.534
- Por favor!
- Shut up.

40:05.805 --> 40:08.875
Thanks for the directions, papi.

40:11.512 --> 40:14.715
Get down!
I said, get down, now!

40:18.185 --> 40:19.852
Come on, Davie...
can you walk?

40:21.155 --> 40:23.290
Okay, you're almost there.

40:23.357 --> 40:25.492
Fucking pig!

40:25.559 --> 40:27.127
Motherfucker.

40:29.697 --> 40:31.165
I gotcha.

40:32.865 --> 40:34.134
They must have drugged him.

40:34.201 --> 40:35.835
Take his hood off.

40:49.249 --> 40:50.883
Move!

41:02.029 --> 41:03.797
Tanya, did you find him yet?

41:03.863 --> 41:04.864
Yeah, yeah, we got him,
we got him.

41:04.932 --> 41:06.500
How bad did they hurt him?

41:06.567 --> 41:08.502
No, I don't...
I don't fucking know, Gillian.

41:08.569 --> 41:12.872
You call me as soon as he's
able to talk to me, you hear me?

41:12.940 --> 41:14.942
I want you to meet me in L.A.

41:15.008 --> 41:16.543
- L.A.?
- Get to the air strip.

41:16.610 --> 41:17.845
The jet's waiting.

41:17.911 --> 41:20.114
Drive as fast as you can,
you got it?

41:20.180 --> 41:22.282
I cannot risk anything
else happening to him.

41:22.349 --> 41:24.884
- Faster, faster.
- I can't go any fucking faster!

41:27.521 --> 41:28.522
Fuck!

41:49.143 --> 41:51.145
You don't belong here.

42:06.827 --> 42:08.128
Mm.

42:11.131 --> 42:13.000
Morning.

42:13.066 --> 42:14.802
Yeah.

42:14.868 --> 42:16.270
Did you get some sleep?

42:17.971 --> 42:19.673
A bit.

42:19.740 --> 42:23.043
I stopped for a couple hours
when my eyes got heavy.

42:23.110 --> 42:24.445
Good.

42:24.511 --> 42:26.113
How far are we from
the next checkpoint?

42:26.180 --> 42:27.381
I gotta pee.

42:27.448 --> 42:29.583
Close.

42:29.650 --> 42:31.920
I just hope it's a place
where there's coffee.

42:42.763 --> 42:44.198
What is this?

42:57.878 --> 42:59.480
The Sinaloa.

42:59.546 --> 43:01.248
Cartel.

43:01.315 --> 43:03.884
Davie moves a lot
of money for them.

43:03.952 --> 43:05.385
I want the girl!

43:07.721 --> 43:10.257
Send her out, and you go.

43:12.693 --> 43:14.528
Jack, please.

43:17.231 --> 43:20.334
Send out that puta, esse!

43:20.400 --> 43:23.403
- Bianca...
- Send out that bitch!

43:23.470 --> 43:25.172
Get out.

43:25.239 --> 43:27.841
Jack, no... please.

43:27.909 --> 43:29.510
I said get out, now!

43:29.576 --> 43:31.011
They're gonna murder me,
you know that, right?

43:31.078 --> 43:32.713
- Now!
- Get out, now!

43:32.779 --> 43:35.582
My blood is gonna be on your
hands, you son of a bitch.

43:41.121 --> 43:43.690
Now!

43:45.058 --> 43:49.029
Go get her! Go!

44:19.027 --> 44:20.394
Get in, get in!

44:21.963 --> 44:23.196
Jesus!

44:25.732 --> 44:27.401
Motherfucker!

44:31.438 --> 44:32.739
Fuck!

44:35.409 --> 44:37.344
You couldn't warn me first?

44:50.925 --> 44:54.528
Woo... 2.6 miles to go!

44:54.595 --> 44:56.296
You better believe
I'm taking this one.

44:56.363 --> 44:57.664
Fuck you, Jack!

44:59.033 --> 45:03.503
Jack better be fixing to reach
this checkpoint, Nelson.

45:03.570 --> 45:08.042
If he loses a stage,
there's no good news for you.

45:08.108 --> 45:11.111
Don't threaten me, Gillian.

45:11.178 --> 45:13.347
"Don't threaten me, Gillian?"

45:15.749 --> 45:19.720
You know, for an old military
grunt, you're a real pussy.

45:19.786 --> 45:22.090
"Don't threaten me, Gillian."

45:22.155 --> 45:24.725
Okay.

45:24.791 --> 45:27.327
Mick is about
to win this stage,

45:27.394 --> 45:29.896
and now you're going
to grow a pair with me?

45:32.934 --> 45:35.903
If I were Jack,
I'd have turned my back

45:35.970 --> 45:38.305
on your pathetic ass years ago.

45:39.206 --> 45:41.675
Now look where you got him...

45:41.742 --> 45:45.178
out there on the road because
you're a low-life degenerate

45:45.245 --> 45:48.116
with a gambling problem.

45:48.181 --> 45:52.586
Got a lot of balls for somebody
who owes us seven figures.

45:53.988 --> 45:55.589
What are you gonna do?

45:56.991 --> 45:58.926
I mean, you gonna kill me?

45:58.993 --> 46:01.194
How's that get you paid?

46:01.261 --> 46:04.264
That gets us paid.

46:04.331 --> 46:06.533
Jack gets us paid.

46:06.600 --> 46:09.803
If he loses, so do you.

46:09.870 --> 46:13.874
If we have to pay out,
we're not the only ones

46:13.941 --> 46:16.176
who are going to feel it.

46:16.243 --> 46:20.948
Killing you is
a consolation prize,

46:21.015 --> 46:25.485
and we'd be doing everybody
around you a goddamn favor.

46:45.472 --> 46:48.275
Jack, what are you doing?

46:48.341 --> 46:49.743
Get back in the car!

46:50.844 --> 46:52.980
Why are we stopping?

46:56.084 --> 46:58.218
Jack!

46:58.285 --> 46:59.319
- Bianca, please...
- Jack!

46:59.386 --> 47:00.988
Please, stop.

47:01.055 --> 47:03.523
Gimme a fucking second,
I've gotta check for damage.

47:03.590 --> 47:06.060
And relax, they're not
after us anymore.

47:08.996 --> 47:11.065
You saved my ass back there.

47:11.132 --> 47:14.035
No one's ever done anything
like that for me before.

47:14.102 --> 47:15.970
I'm sorry I didn't
warn you sooner.

47:16.037 --> 47:17.571
I figured the only way
they were gonna buy it

47:17.637 --> 47:19.740
is if you thought
I was giving you up.

47:19.806 --> 47:22.210
I sure as hell thought
you were gonna give me up.

47:22.275 --> 47:25.879
And then you mowed him down.

47:40.128 --> 47:41.361
Thank you.

47:43.030 --> 47:44.498
Sure.

47:48.335 --> 47:50.604
You know, come to think of it,

47:50.670 --> 47:53.774
Davie said all of
the GPS systems

47:53.840 --> 47:56.911
were preprogrammed with the
destinations of the checkpoints.

48:00.814 --> 48:02.616
That's how he's
been tracking us.

48:04.018 --> 48:05.719
That's how he led us
into that ambush.

48:09.190 --> 48:10.824
Now what?

48:10.891 --> 48:12.359
We don't know where the next
checkpoints are located.

48:12.425 --> 48:15.229
I have an idea.

48:15.295 --> 48:16.563
Do you have Instagram?

48:16.630 --> 48:19.233
- Yeah.
- I figured.

48:19.299 --> 48:22.502
Uh, look up Six-Speed Nina.

48:22.569 --> 48:24.805
If I recall correctly,
she said something about

48:24.871 --> 48:27.909
Puerto Poco or Puerto Puntasca
or something like that.

48:27.975 --> 48:29.177
I got it...

48:29.243 --> 48:30.278
Puerto Penasco?

48:30.343 --> 48:32.746
Yeah, yeah, that sounds right.

48:32.813 --> 48:34.881
Got it.

48:34.949 --> 48:37.684
Hola, race fans, it's your
girl, Six-Speed Nina, and

48:37.751 --> 48:41.956
I am here at
El Tesoro Escondido,

48:42.023 --> 48:46.928
in the town of Hermosio, our
first stop in the Outlaw 1000.

48:46.994 --> 48:48.829
And you'd better believe
I'll be chowing down

48:48.895 --> 48:53.333
on some bean burritos before the
race moves to Puerto Penasco.

48:53.400 --> 48:55.236
I knew she wouldn't
let us down.

48:55.303 --> 48:56.469
All right, come on, let's go.

49:05.412 --> 49:07.714
Woo!

49:07.781 --> 49:10.650
Where's everybody at?

49:10.717 --> 49:12.853
Did I win this
motherfucking round?

49:12.920 --> 49:15.655
I think I did.

49:18.192 --> 49:19.693
Whew.

49:22.562 --> 49:25.299
Hey, yo, I'm here.

49:25.365 --> 49:28.401
So? And you are?

49:28.468 --> 49:30.071
Mick Hammett.

49:30.137 --> 49:32.739
And it looks like I'm the first
motherfucker to show up.

49:32.806 --> 49:35.009
Well,
congratu-fucking-lations.

49:37.444 --> 49:39.713
Are you sure it's
safe to check in?

49:39.779 --> 49:41.182
Davie won't risk
doing anything to us

49:41.249 --> 49:43.084
in front of the other drivers.

49:44.352 --> 49:46.187
What do you want
from me, dude?

49:46.254 --> 49:47.854
Don't you got somebody
you gotta call or something?

49:51.892 --> 49:55.263
I want you to call who
you're supposed to call.

49:55.329 --> 49:57.397
- Uh, perdona me...
- Yes?

49:57.464 --> 49:59.000
Jack Tyson, checking
in for the Outlaw?

49:59.066 --> 50:01.768
Welcome, Mr. Tyson.
You're the stage winner.

50:01.835 --> 50:02.970
I am?

50:03.037 --> 50:04.171
Whoa, whoa, no,
the fuck he's not.

50:04.238 --> 50:05.772
I was here before he was!

50:05.839 --> 50:07.674
You were just talking to me
before he pulled up!

50:07.741 --> 50:09.343
Man, I don't know who you are

50:09.409 --> 50:11.212
or what the fuck
you want from me,

50:11.279 --> 50:14.115
but you just come in here
talking about "I've arrived."

50:14.181 --> 50:16.017
Look, man, he's right.
He won fair and square.

50:16.083 --> 50:17.884
I was here before he got here,
you were just...

50:17.952 --> 50:20.988
Man, back the fuck up, dude,
right now, all right?

50:21.055 --> 50:22.223
You got five seconds.

50:22.290 --> 50:23.623
That's right, man.

50:25.659 --> 50:28.628
Yeah... keep walking, man.

50:37.071 --> 50:39.140
Hello?
Yeah, this is Robert.

50:39.206 --> 50:40.308
Got your first winner.

50:40.374 --> 50:41.775
Mr. Tyson.

50:41.841 --> 50:43.443
That's some major bullshit.

50:45.879 --> 50:48.316
Well?

50:48.382 --> 50:50.217
He did it...
two more to go.

50:56.924 --> 50:59.526
Wait...

50:59.592 --> 51:01.895
That's why Davie
gave me the 100k?

51:04.031 --> 51:05.366
What?

51:05.433 --> 51:06.666
Yeah, you needed
some action on Jack

51:06.733 --> 51:08.802
so that no one
asked any questions.

51:08.868 --> 51:11.005
You need this to look legit.

51:12.672 --> 51:14.641
I don't follow.

51:14.708 --> 51:18.946
You know, I might look
like a brain-dead meathead,

51:19.013 --> 51:23.117
but even a kid
really could figure this out.

51:24.352 --> 51:26.786
Yeah, the bettors,
they aren't taking Jack

51:26.853 --> 51:29.823
because they're
losing on purpose.

51:29.889 --> 51:34.195
Yeah... you and Davie
retain the cash

51:34.261 --> 51:37.831
that they lose on the bet at
a commission, and then what?

51:39.666 --> 51:42.869
My guess is you're
supposed to spend it,

51:42.937 --> 51:45.906
or move it to where
they tell you to.

51:47.741 --> 51:50.677
In the end, no one loses
a dime on the wager,

51:50.744 --> 51:55.483
and you make, what,
18 million on stage two?

51:55.548 --> 51:59.086
This is money-laundering.

51:59.153 --> 52:01.022
Yeah.

52:01.088 --> 52:03.257
This whole thing
is just a front.

52:30.217 --> 52:32.319
You figure that out
by yourself?

52:34.321 --> 52:35.622
How about that?

52:40.727 --> 52:44.631
You know, at the end
of the day,

52:44.697 --> 52:47.867
you and Davie are just

52:47.935 --> 52:51.138
two lowlife degenerates
like me.

52:52.540 --> 52:55.009
I am nothing like you.

52:55.076 --> 53:00.214
I am a businesswoman,
earning a living...

53:00.281 --> 53:04.584
a rather lucrative one,
I might add.

53:08.655 --> 53:10.224
Until Jack gets to L.A.

53:22.470 --> 53:24.038
Well, it looks like
you're gonna have to wait

53:24.105 --> 53:25.940
a little longer
before that cup of coffee.

53:26.006 --> 53:28.375
So, you won, right?

53:30.677 --> 53:32.779
Well, as you can see,
there was a little controversy,

53:32.846 --> 53:35.015
but yeah, I guess
we took the stage.

53:36.383 --> 53:37.884
"We?"

53:37.952 --> 53:40.787
You're in the car, too...

53:40.854 --> 53:42.056
whether I like it or not.

53:44.291 --> 53:45.725
So which is it?

53:48.661 --> 53:49.997
Still deciding.

53:53.200 --> 53:55.903
Should we let the others
know what we found in the car?

53:55.970 --> 53:57.704
They have every right
to their privacy.

53:59.672 --> 54:01.741
Hey, yo, Six.

54:02.842 --> 54:05.246
Mr. World Champ.

54:05.312 --> 54:07.148
Hey, I wanna thank you
for yesterday.

54:07.214 --> 54:09.649
You know, helping me out
back there when Mick

54:09.716 --> 54:11.085
was trying to run
me off the road.

54:11.152 --> 54:12.153
No problem.

54:12.219 --> 54:14.754
Let's just say he had it coming.

54:14.821 --> 54:16.390
Yeah, okay.

54:16.457 --> 54:18.926
Well, I'll tell you,
he was super pissed.

54:18.993 --> 54:21.362
Then after what happened
in the station...

54:21.428 --> 54:23.097
I'd watch your back.

54:23.164 --> 54:25.466
He's stupid, but I don't
think he has it in him.

54:25.533 --> 54:28.068
Heh... yeah.

54:28.135 --> 54:29.470
Well, I just wanted
to give you a head's up

54:29.537 --> 54:30.737
on what's going down.

54:30.803 --> 54:32.072
- Well, I appreciate that.
- Mm-hmm.

54:32.139 --> 54:35.609
- Well, now it's my turn.
- Yeah?

54:35.675 --> 54:37.111
You think you can grab Mick

54:37.178 --> 54:38.811
and meet me back here
in about five minutes?

54:38.878 --> 54:41.315
I gotta tell you guys something.

54:41.382 --> 54:43.083
- Okay.
- See you here in five.

54:43.150 --> 54:44.418
Yeah.

54:47.021 --> 54:49.689
You say a fucking word,
and I will kill you.

55:00.867 --> 55:01.834
Who's calling?

55:01.902 --> 55:03.404
Hi, Jack.

55:03.470 --> 55:06.373
You don't know me,
so let me introduce myself.

55:06.440 --> 55:08.309
I'm Gillian Bertrand.

55:08.375 --> 55:11.245
I guess "attaboy"
is in order first...

55:11.312 --> 55:12.947
two stages so far.

55:13.013 --> 55:14.982
Gotta hand it to you.

55:15.049 --> 55:17.985
Why are you calling me?
Where's my brother?

55:18.052 --> 55:20.720
Relax, nobody's lying
in a ditch face-down

55:20.787 --> 55:22.489
with the back of
their head blown off.

55:22.556 --> 55:26.527
All right, I'm listening.
What do you want?

55:26.594 --> 55:29.330
The same thing Davie wants.

55:29.396 --> 55:31.932
We got a good thing going,
all of us.

55:31.999 --> 55:34.401
Then why are you
calling me and not him?

55:34.468 --> 55:36.270
I need you to focus, Jack.

55:36.337 --> 55:39.373
Don't let that bitch
screw this up.

55:39.440 --> 55:42.775
She's just another one
of Davie's crazy ex-girlfriends

55:42.842 --> 55:44.877
with an anger
management problem.

55:47.248 --> 55:49.516
If Davie likes making deals,

55:49.583 --> 55:51.784
well, you can tell him
I got one for him.

55:51.851 --> 55:55.990
Bianca for my brother...
even trade.

55:56.056 --> 56:00.427
We never hear from either
one of you again... debt paid.

56:00.494 --> 56:03.063
Are you there?

56:03.130 --> 56:04.665
Oh, I'm here, Jack,

56:04.732 --> 56:07.568
and I think I could speak
for him when I say we're

56:07.635 --> 56:09.536
ready to agree to your terms...

56:09.603 --> 56:11.238
even trade.

56:19.913 --> 56:22.983
He's not coming.

56:23.050 --> 56:24.218
Oh... his loss.

56:24.285 --> 56:28.222
Listen, we're all being watched.

56:28.289 --> 56:29.822
There's cameras in the car.

56:29.889 --> 56:31.258
Wh... what?

56:31.325 --> 56:32.459
- Yeah, come...
- But how?

56:32.526 --> 56:35.229
Come on.

56:35.296 --> 56:38.732
Look, check the dash and up
above, you should find...

56:38.798 --> 56:40.167
What?

56:45.838 --> 56:48.242
What in the hell?

56:48.309 --> 56:49.576
Yeah.

56:51.912 --> 56:54.415
Wait... how did you know this?

56:54.481 --> 56:58.419
Nina, some things are
better left unanswered.

56:58.485 --> 57:00.887
Do you want some advice?

57:00.954 --> 57:02.456
Get out of the race game,

57:02.523 --> 57:05.192
and you'll avoid guys
like Davie.

57:05.259 --> 57:06.960
One of these days you're
gonna realize it's...

57:07.027 --> 57:10.030
it's not worth the risk anymore.

57:11.098 --> 57:12.832
Jack!
Jack, behind you, watch out!

57:19.807 --> 57:21.775
Mick, stop, let him go!

57:21.841 --> 57:23.644
Yeah, two of them, right now,

57:23.711 --> 57:25.878
they're fighting in the
middle of my gas station.

57:29.683 --> 57:30.818
Are we done?

57:31.884 --> 57:33.187
Are we done?

57:42.529 --> 57:44.598
You all right?

57:44.665 --> 57:46.967
- You're hurt.
- Yeah.

57:47.034 --> 57:48.335
Come on, we gotta go.

58:14.328 --> 58:17.231
Here, keep this on there
to stop the bleeding.

58:22.736 --> 58:23.937
What's wrong?

58:27.174 --> 58:30.043
I have a daughter.

58:30.110 --> 58:31.578
She's six years old.

58:32.980 --> 58:34.114
Her name is Sophia.

58:37.751 --> 58:40.954
And where is she
while you're here?

58:41.021 --> 58:43.690
Somewhere safe.

58:43.757 --> 58:46.727
I'm not gonna say where,
I never know who's listening.

58:46.794 --> 58:49.630
Does she know how brave
her mother is for doing this?

58:49.696 --> 58:52.232
Every waking moment
should be spent with her,

58:52.299 --> 58:54.903
but she needs me to do this.

58:54.968 --> 58:56.637
The feds are gonna help her.

58:56.703 --> 58:58.105
I give them what they want,

58:58.172 --> 59:00.574
they help me get her
into the United States,

59:00.641 --> 59:02.075
give us new lives,

59:02.142 --> 59:04.077
and give her the medical
procedure that she needs.

59:10.551 --> 59:11.685
Pemex Gas.

59:11.752 --> 59:14.054
Roberto, is there
anybody still there?

59:14.121 --> 59:15.924
Yeah, one of them's
still here...

59:15.989 --> 59:17.791
the one that lost.

59:17.858 --> 59:19.760
Let me talk to him.

59:19.827 --> 59:21.261
All right, hold on.

59:21.328 --> 59:24.598
Yo, loser...
you got a phone call, man.

59:24.665 --> 59:25.999
Hurry the fuck up, dude.

59:27.936 --> 59:29.436
What's up?

59:29.503 --> 59:33.474
Mick?
This is Gillian Bertrand.

59:33.540 --> 59:35.944
I heard you two got
into it earlier,

59:36.009 --> 59:38.545
and I see now Jack
has left you behind.

59:38.612 --> 59:40.113
Yeah, I'm gonna
catch up to that motherfucker

59:40.180 --> 59:41.181
and make him pay.

59:41.248 --> 59:42.616
See that you do.

59:42.683 --> 59:46.987
And make sure you
win the next stage...

59:47.054 --> 59:49.022
whatever it takes.

59:49.089 --> 59:52.626
My brother and I are moving a
whole lot of money to your ride.

59:52.693 --> 59:54.261
And Mick...

59:55.662 --> 01:00:00.100
don't make us regret
putting our faith in you.

01:00:01.034 --> 01:00:02.870
Consider it done.

01:00:02.937 --> 01:00:04.238
Hurry the fuck up.

01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:09.944
What the fuck you doing, dude?

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:11.678
Here's your phone, pussy.

01:00:24.525 --> 01:00:26.928
Jack?

01:00:26.995 --> 01:00:28.095
We have a problem.

01:00:28.161 --> 01:00:29.530
Yeah? What's that?

01:00:29.596 --> 01:00:31.832
I don't have a visa
or a permit.

01:00:31.899 --> 01:00:34.601
The U.S. attorney's office
didn't send you anything?

01:00:34.668 --> 01:00:36.336
I couldn't let them know
I was coming,

01:00:36.403 --> 01:00:38.605
I couldn't risk Davie
knowing what I was doing.

01:00:38.672 --> 01:00:39.773
Oh, God.

01:00:41.174 --> 01:00:42.977
All right, great, so how
do we cross the border?

01:00:43.043 --> 01:00:44.411
You got any great ideas?

01:00:44.478 --> 01:00:47.147
Yes, but it's very dangerous.

01:00:47.214 --> 01:00:48.649
Ah, because of course it is,

01:00:48.715 --> 01:00:51.084
and why would it
be any other way?

01:00:52.686 --> 01:00:55.455
We need to go back around
where we came from, 20 miles.

01:00:55.522 --> 01:00:56.557
Mm.

01:01:10.437 --> 01:01:13.106
Wait...
wait, what's happening?

01:01:13.173 --> 01:01:15.342
What did you do?

01:01:15.409 --> 01:01:16.777
What is your problem?

01:01:18.679 --> 01:01:22.349
First you're bitching that no
one's betting on your brother.

01:01:22.416 --> 01:01:24.818
Now he's won two stages

01:01:24.885 --> 01:01:27.387
and everybody wants a piece
of the action,

01:01:27.454 --> 01:01:29.256
and that's no good either?

01:01:29.323 --> 01:01:30.524
Make up your mind.

01:01:30.591 --> 01:01:31.993
No, you...

01:01:32.060 --> 01:01:33.928
no, you don't want Jack's
bets to win, all right?

01:01:33.995 --> 01:01:35.395
You'd have to pay out big.

01:01:35.462 --> 01:01:37.497
Look at the size of these
wagers coming in.

01:01:37.564 --> 01:01:40.634
That's more than the commission
you made on the entire race.

01:01:42.269 --> 01:01:43.570
This stinks.

01:01:44.771 --> 01:01:46.239
What did you do?

01:01:54.815 --> 01:01:56.350
Gillian...

01:01:56.416 --> 01:01:57.784
Gillian...
please, Gillian.

01:01:57.851 --> 01:02:00.922
Please, please.

01:02:00.989 --> 01:02:02.255
Get out of this office,

01:02:02.322 --> 01:02:05.792
before I blow your
fucking head off.

01:02:05.859 --> 01:02:07.194
Okay.

01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:09.896
I'm tired of you.

01:02:09.964 --> 01:02:12.165
- Now!
- Okay!

01:02:22.043 --> 01:02:23.744
If we die, I'm blaming you.

01:02:30.517 --> 01:02:32.619
Is that who I think it is?

01:02:32.686 --> 01:02:35.155
There's another car
following us.

01:02:35.222 --> 01:02:37.557
Here we go.
Whew.

01:02:38.993 --> 01:02:40.827
It's that asshole
from the gas station again.

01:02:58.578 --> 01:03:01.481
Ah!

01:03:12.459 --> 01:03:14.327
Here's the border,
it's right there!

01:03:14.394 --> 01:03:16.530
Can you hit that button
and make us go faster?

01:03:16.596 --> 01:03:18.365
Yeah, nitrous in
desert terrain...

01:03:18.432 --> 01:03:20.034
recipe for disaster.

01:03:20.101 --> 01:03:21.702
Crack the axle, the car is dead.

01:03:25.439 --> 01:03:28.308
Get him!
Get him, damn it!

01:04:01.241 --> 01:04:02.476
Ah!

01:04:02.542 --> 01:04:06.279
Mick, you worthless
piece of...

01:04:07.347 --> 01:04:10.985
Jack cannot win this stage!

01:04:11.052 --> 01:04:13.453
Oh! Oh!

01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.555
That's a big payout.

01:04:17.424 --> 01:04:20.027
"More than you made on
commissions this far."

01:04:32.206 --> 01:04:34.041
They're in Arizona.

01:04:44.185 --> 01:04:45.953
How's your day going?

01:04:46.020 --> 01:04:47.420
It's fucked.

01:04:47.487 --> 01:04:50.224
So tell me about it...
what's really going on?

01:04:50.290 --> 01:04:51.725
Man...

01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:55.163
man, I've dealt with
some people in my life,

01:04:55.229 --> 01:04:58.498
but this bitch, she's
something else, you know?

01:04:58.565 --> 01:05:01.668
Ah... a real chinga
tu madre, eh?

01:05:01.735 --> 01:05:02.736
Ah, si.

01:05:02.803 --> 01:05:04.906
- Hit me.
- All right.

01:05:07.208 --> 01:05:09.143
In that case, drink up.

01:05:09.210 --> 01:05:10.443
Mm, cheers.

01:05:17.350 --> 01:05:18.953
You gonna get that?

01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:20.687
No fucking way.

01:05:24.825 --> 01:05:27.527
I watched you ignore my call.

01:05:29.696 --> 01:05:32.099
Seems like a dick move,
don't you think?

01:05:32.166 --> 01:05:34.668
Look, Gillian, I'm just
having a drink, okay?

01:05:34.734 --> 01:05:37.437
- Get up.
- Come on.

01:05:37.504 --> 01:05:39.606
Get up and out!

01:05:39.673 --> 01:05:41.175
- All right, all right...
- Now!

01:05:41.242 --> 01:05:43.844
You don't have to do this.

01:05:43.911 --> 01:05:46.080
- Now, Nelson.
- It is what it is, man.

01:05:46.147 --> 01:05:48.216
Welcome to Navojoa.

01:05:48.282 --> 01:05:50.952
- Oh...
- Leave it...

01:05:51.018 --> 01:05:52.352
Consider it your tip.

01:05:52.419 --> 01:05:53.553
- Thank you, boss.
- Move it!

01:05:53.620 --> 01:05:55.089
What are you doing, Gillian?

01:05:55.156 --> 01:05:57.858
It's time to meet up
with your brother.

01:05:57.925 --> 01:05:59.793
I hope you're not
afraid of flying.

01:06:39.333 --> 01:06:41.035
Jack, you okay?

01:06:44.906 --> 01:06:49.409
Jack, help!

01:06:49.476 --> 01:06:51.411
Tell me what's going on, Jack.

01:06:51.478 --> 01:06:53.480
I don't know.

01:06:53.546 --> 01:06:54.881
I'm...

01:06:56.883 --> 01:06:58.019
Where am I?

01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:01.155
Hey, we're okay.

01:07:01.222 --> 01:07:02.189
We made it.

01:07:02.256 --> 01:07:03.757
We're gonna be fine.

01:07:07.494 --> 01:07:08.762
What can I do?

01:07:21.008 --> 01:07:23.044
Remember you asked me
if I ever killed anybody?

01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:27.647
Well, the answer is yes.

01:07:29.516 --> 01:07:31.185
What happened?

01:07:32.719 --> 01:07:34.121
It was a blind corner.

01:07:37.224 --> 01:07:39.526
We both saw it, but I...

01:07:39.592 --> 01:07:41.761
I miscalculated, and...

01:07:43.663 --> 01:07:45.066
I drove us off the side.

01:07:47.534 --> 01:07:49.569
The car landed upside-down,

01:07:50.804 --> 01:07:53.174
the fuel tank exploded,

01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:55.076
and the car burned up
from the outside.

01:07:55.142 --> 01:07:56.576
I...

01:07:59.479 --> 01:08:01.548
I made it out,
but my wife, she...

01:08:05.319 --> 01:08:06.253
she got trapped.

01:08:07.455 --> 01:08:08.755
It's not your fault.

01:08:11.325 --> 01:08:13.260
Growing up, it was
just me and my brother.

01:08:15.363 --> 01:08:17.999
But he got screwed up
in the war, you know, PTSD.

01:08:19.966 --> 01:08:22.970
All I had was my skin, my car,
and the streets.

01:08:24.770 --> 01:08:28.575
You know, I had this '74 Camaro,

01:08:28.640 --> 01:08:29.843
ran like a beast.

01:08:31.312 --> 01:08:33.645
It was an eight-second car.

01:08:33.712 --> 01:08:36.149
I lived my life a quarter
of a mile at a time.

01:08:38.986 --> 01:08:41.188
You know, they say you're
only as good as your last race,

01:08:41.255 --> 01:08:44.624
and when my wife died,
I was done.

01:08:45.825 --> 01:08:47.294
I'm so sorry, Jack.

01:08:49.595 --> 01:08:51.731
It's funny,
because growing up,

01:08:51.798 --> 01:08:54.801
all I wanted to do is
be the best, the fastest.

01:08:54.868 --> 01:08:56.270
Some people would say I was.

01:08:58.406 --> 01:08:59.974
But I never felt that way.

01:09:02.410 --> 01:09:05.312
When my foot hits that pedal
and I hit top gear...

01:09:06.679 --> 01:09:07.814
I feel free.

01:09:09.216 --> 01:09:11.185
There's no better
feeling in the world.

01:09:12.752 --> 01:09:14.687
See all the cars behind me,

01:09:16.555 --> 01:09:18.225
look in front of me...

01:09:18.292 --> 01:09:19.326
nobody.

01:09:21.261 --> 01:09:23.930
But as soon as
the race was over,

01:09:23.997 --> 01:09:27.334
I'd be right back
to where I started...

01:09:27.401 --> 01:09:29.103
waiting for the flags to wave.

01:09:30.703 --> 01:09:34.640
I knew I had to get out,
do something different.

01:09:34.707 --> 01:09:39.679
But I'll tell you, Bianca,
I feel like I'm pushing my luck.

01:09:40.981 --> 01:09:42.015
No.

01:09:43.250 --> 01:09:45.086
We're gonna make it
to Los Angeles...

01:09:46.487 --> 01:09:49.889
for your brother,
for my daughter.

01:09:49.957 --> 01:09:53.260
Look at me.
Look at me.

01:10:03.770 --> 01:10:05.973
You saved my life.

01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:09.776
We're gonna get through this,
I promise.

01:10:18.285 --> 01:10:19.686
You ready?

01:10:21.522 --> 01:10:22.856
All right, let's go.

01:10:55.322 --> 01:10:57.091
Gillian?

01:10:57.158 --> 01:10:59.994
I want to make
an arrangement with you.

01:11:00.060 --> 01:11:02.596
Forget everything
that Davie wanted.

01:11:02.662 --> 01:11:05.533
Forget about winning this race.

01:11:05.599 --> 01:11:07.902
I'll make it worth your while.

01:11:07.968 --> 01:11:09.370
Forget about winning the race?

01:11:09.436 --> 01:11:13.773
Yes, Jack...
you give me no choice.

01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:16.043
You are coming
near checkpoint three,

01:11:16.110 --> 01:11:20.314
and those other gearhead
idiots are nowhere near you.

01:11:20.381 --> 01:11:24.518
What's it going to take for
you to lose this race, huh?

01:11:24.585 --> 01:11:27.588
Five mil?

01:11:27.655 --> 01:11:31.791
Ten mil?
What do you want?

01:11:31.858 --> 01:11:33.260
Talk to me!

01:11:33.327 --> 01:11:34.694
You know what, Gillian?

01:11:34.761 --> 01:11:36.263
Right now I'm currently driving,

01:11:36.330 --> 01:11:37.897
and I'm pretty sure
it's against the law

01:11:37.965 --> 01:11:40.501
to drive and talk in
the state of Arizona.

01:11:40.568 --> 01:11:41.602
Jack?

01:11:41.669 --> 01:11:44.939
Jack? Jack!

01:11:45.005 --> 01:11:47.975
Oh, you miserable bastard!

01:12:01.922 --> 01:12:03.390
We're getting close
to checkpoint three,

01:12:03.457 --> 01:12:04.925
and she is freaking out.

01:12:04.992 --> 01:12:06.759
Good, nice to have
them on that side of things

01:12:06.826 --> 01:12:07.962
for a change.

01:12:26.046 --> 01:12:28.582
When does Jack get here?

01:12:28.649 --> 01:12:30.117
Get him outta the car.

01:12:37.057 --> 01:12:39.159
Fuck you, Nelson.

01:12:40.961 --> 01:12:43.130
You motherfucker!

01:12:45.733 --> 01:12:47.901
- Fucker!
- Oh, fuck you!

01:12:47.968 --> 01:12:48.902
- Shut up!
- Fuck you!

01:12:50.571 --> 01:12:52.772
Fuck you!

01:12:52.839 --> 01:12:54.807
Shut up!

01:12:54.874 --> 01:12:56.910
Get...
get down, motherfucker.

01:12:58.078 --> 01:13:00.347
Ha, ha, ha, Nelson!

01:13:00.414 --> 01:13:01.682
You fucking bitch.

01:13:08.222 --> 01:13:10.557
I want your brother to see
you dead in the sand, esse.

01:13:10.624 --> 01:13:11.891
Oh, man...

01:13:11.959 --> 01:13:13.527
Just fucking do it!

01:13:17.998 --> 01:13:19.967
Fuck you!

01:13:25.272 --> 01:13:27.007
Oh!

01:13:29.876 --> 01:13:31.878
Come in!

01:13:35.882 --> 01:13:37.384
Jesus!

01:13:37.451 --> 01:13:39.520
You couldn't take that
crap off of your head?

01:13:39.586 --> 01:13:41.255
She's six, for chrissake!

01:13:41.322 --> 01:13:44.358
Oh, you think she's pick
you up out of a lineup?

01:13:44.425 --> 01:13:46.927
Ai...
now I got to deal with this.

01:13:46.994 --> 01:13:48.962
Come here, come here...

01:13:49.029 --> 01:13:51.565
Hey there, little one,
don't cry, okay?

01:13:51.632 --> 01:13:53.701
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:13:53.767 --> 01:13:56.570
You must be Sophia, huh?

01:13:56.637 --> 01:13:59.073
Would you get the hell out?

01:13:59.139 --> 01:14:00.974
Where's Mommy?

01:14:02.242 --> 01:14:03.944
We're going to see Mommy.

01:14:04.011 --> 01:14:06.914
Have you ever been
on a helicopter before?

01:14:09.817 --> 01:14:12.086
What the hell is this?

01:14:12.152 --> 01:14:14.421
Don't stop, Jack,
keep driving.

01:14:19.059 --> 01:14:20.494
Oh, my God, it's Nelson.

01:14:32.473 --> 01:14:33.907
Nelson?

01:14:35.275 --> 01:14:36.477
Nelson?

01:14:36.543 --> 01:14:38.045
It's okay, buddy.

01:14:38.112 --> 01:14:39.546
I got you, I got you.

01:14:40.681 --> 01:14:41.915
It's gonna be okay, buddy.

01:14:41.982 --> 01:14:44.284
I'm gonna get you
to the hospital.

01:14:44.351 --> 01:14:46.019
- Don't talk.
- I'm sorry!

01:14:46.086 --> 01:14:49.189
I'm sorry you had...
you were stuck with me...

01:14:49.256 --> 01:14:51.759
- No.
- ...for a brother.

01:14:51.825 --> 01:14:53.627
- No, man!
- I'm sorry.

01:14:53.694 --> 01:14:55.062
No!

01:14:56.730 --> 01:14:58.332
No, Nelson!

01:15:12.913 --> 01:15:14.415
Jack...

01:15:25.793 --> 01:15:27.060
Davie.

01:15:32.199 --> 01:15:34.868
It's Gillian.

01:15:34.935 --> 01:15:36.570
I'm coming for you.

01:15:36.637 --> 01:15:38.205
No, not for me...

01:15:38.272 --> 01:15:40.174
for little Sophia.

01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.543
Mommy! Mommy?

01:15:42.609 --> 01:15:43.610
Where's Mommy?

01:15:43.677 --> 01:15:45.946
What is it?

01:15:50.250 --> 01:15:51.385
Mommy, are you there?

01:15:51.452 --> 01:15:52.386
Sophia!

01:15:52.453 --> 01:15:53.922
Baby, it's gonna be all right.

01:15:53.987 --> 01:15:55.389
Mommy!

01:15:55.456 --> 01:15:56.590
We're coming for you.

01:15:56.657 --> 01:15:57.926
Mommy?

01:15:57.991 --> 01:15:59.593
It's okay.
It's okay!

01:16:02.763 --> 01:16:03.697
You listen to me.

01:16:03.764 --> 01:16:05.332
Shut up, Jack.

01:16:05.399 --> 01:16:09.236
You and that bitch meet me
at the finish line downtown.

01:16:09.303 --> 01:16:12.005
You give me the thumb drives,
I'll give you the kid.

01:16:12.072 --> 01:16:13.841
These are my terms.

01:16:18.979 --> 01:16:20.647
Help me get my brother.

01:16:21.815 --> 01:16:23.584
And grab that gun.

01:17:21.041 --> 01:17:22.643
Fuck, dude.

01:17:29.951 --> 01:17:31.318
Fuck!

01:17:46.199 --> 01:17:48.068
What the fuck, man?

01:17:55.809 --> 01:17:58.412
Shit, first fucking place.

01:18:05.819 --> 01:18:07.354
It's an ambush!

01:18:17.464 --> 01:18:19.099
Oh!

01:18:33.513 --> 01:18:35.782
You son of a bitch, come here.

01:18:37.618 --> 01:18:38.552
Sophia!

01:18:38.619 --> 01:18:39.886
Let her go!

01:18:39.954 --> 01:18:41.622
This is for my brother,
you son of a bitch!

01:18:41.688 --> 01:18:43.890
Jack, stop, goddamn it,
or she dies, too!

01:18:45.392 --> 01:18:46.893
Let the girl go

01:18:46.961 --> 01:18:48.862
and you and I will sort
the rest out, you hear me?

01:18:48.930 --> 01:18:51.531
Give my brother the thumb
drives, and let him go.

01:18:51.598 --> 01:18:53.333
Give me back my daughter!

01:18:53.400 --> 01:18:55.168
Gimme the drives, Bianca.

01:18:57.005 --> 01:18:59.040
Let the girl go and
I'll let Davie here go...

01:18:59.107 --> 01:19:00.407
even trade.

01:19:00.474 --> 01:19:02.442
These are my terms, Jack!

01:19:02.509 --> 01:19:05.345
Give my brother the thumb drives
and let him go.

01:19:07.414 --> 01:19:09.083
Don't hurt her, please!

01:19:09.149 --> 01:19:11.284
Please, don't hurt her!

01:19:11.351 --> 01:19:12.920
Where are the drives, Bianca?

01:19:12.987 --> 01:19:14.354
Give her back to me!

01:19:14.421 --> 01:19:16.289
If I was you, I would
shut up real fast.

01:19:16.356 --> 01:19:18.258
Let her go!

01:19:34.108 --> 01:19:36.209
Drop the gun!

01:19:39.279 --> 01:19:40.547
Let go of the girl!

01:19:42.883 --> 01:19:44.085
Let go of the girl!

01:19:44.152 --> 01:19:45.852
Drop your weapon!

01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:46.954
Put your hands on the car!

01:19:50.357 --> 01:19:52.659
Sophia! Sophia!

01:19:52.726 --> 01:19:55.796
- Wait!
- You'll see your daughter.

01:19:55.862 --> 01:19:56.863
Take her to the vehicle.

01:20:02.170 --> 01:20:03.370
Are you Six-Speed Nina?

01:20:03.437 --> 01:20:06.707
Yes. What the hell?

01:20:06.773 --> 01:20:08.575
I'll kill your whole
fucking family, Jack.

01:20:12.679 --> 01:20:14.481
Jack, what are they gonna do?

01:20:19.753 --> 01:20:22.190
- Are you Bianca?
- That's my daughter!

01:20:22.255 --> 01:20:24.058
That's what she's been
telling us over and over again.

01:20:24.125 --> 01:20:25.525
Come here, honey.

01:20:25.592 --> 01:20:28.261
You can sit in here, up front.

01:20:28.328 --> 01:20:29.663
Mommy and Daddy
can ride in back.

01:20:29.730 --> 01:20:32.265
It'll all be okay,
just sit tight.

01:20:33.767 --> 01:20:36.570
- Hi, Mommy.
- Hi, sweetie.

01:20:36.636 --> 01:20:38.371
Mommy, I wanna get out,

01:20:38.438 --> 01:20:41.142
I don't wanna be
in any more cars.

01:20:41.209 --> 01:20:43.243
You and me both, kid.
