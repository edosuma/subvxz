00:01.479 --> 00:04.395
Previously on
"Gotham Knights"...

00:04.395 --> 00:06.006
We've been set up.

00:06.006 --> 00:06.963
Thousands
have lined the streets

00:06.963 --> 00:08.051
to honor the city's

00:08.051 --> 00:09.705
fallen hero Bruce Wayne,

00:09.705 --> 00:12.447
who Gotham has now learned
was Batman.

00:12.447 --> 00:15.798
Wayne is survived
by his son Turner Hayes.

00:17.321 --> 00:20.542
Your father had Alfred.
You have me.

00:20.542 --> 00:21.978
This makes
it look like the person

00:21.978 --> 00:23.806
who paid to have
your dad killed is you.

00:23.806 --> 00:25.416
They think
I killed my dad

00:25.416 --> 00:26.983
because I wanted
his money?

00:26.983 --> 00:28.724
It's the bat brat.

00:28.724 --> 00:31.031
The night he was killed,
this was found on your father.

00:31.031 --> 00:33.772
All aboard
the Blackgate Express.

00:33.772 --> 00:35.513
Uhh!

00:38.777 --> 00:40.040
Your little attempt
at escape

00:40.040 --> 00:41.954
just made my job
a little easier.

00:41.954 --> 00:43.739
He's in on it.
They all are.

00:46.959 --> 00:48.091
Who the hell
are you?

00:48.091 --> 00:49.397
I'm Robin.

00:49.397 --> 00:50.572
We are marshaling

00:50.572 --> 00:52.487
all of the city's resources

00:52.487 --> 00:55.185
to hunt down these fugitives.

00:55.185 --> 00:58.536
Harper and Cullen Row,
the Joker's daughter,

00:58.536 --> 01:00.669
and Bruce Wayne's own son.

01:00.669 --> 01:02.323
We're gonna find
who really killed my dad

01:02.323 --> 01:04.020
and clear our names.

01:04.020 --> 01:05.630
It's the symbol
of the Court of Owls.

01:05.630 --> 01:07.154
They're the ones who
really run this city.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.894
No one knows who they are

01:08.894 --> 01:11.201
'cause if you find out...

01:11.201 --> 01:13.769
it'll be the last thing
you ever see.

01:31.526 --> 01:32.614
Negative, negative.

01:33.876 --> 01:34.920
Man 2: Clear.

01:47.542 --> 01:49.370
Did you know about this?

01:49.370 --> 01:51.676
Bruce shared
many secrets with me

01:51.676 --> 01:53.113
but this wasn't
one of them.

01:54.984 --> 01:56.681
Bag and tag everything.

01:56.681 --> 01:58.205
Let's go.
Pack up all the security.

01:58.205 --> 01:59.815
But the irony--
people who couldn't

01:59.815 --> 02:01.556
stop crime in Gotham
treating the man

02:01.556 --> 02:03.862
who did like a criminal.

02:03.862 --> 02:05.125
Bruce was my friend.

02:06.387 --> 02:08.258
So was Turner.

02:08.258 --> 02:09.955
Will you bag and tag
him as well?

02:13.045 --> 02:16.832
♪ I'm only happy

02:16.832 --> 02:20.836
♪ I'm only happy

Matches your new hair.

02:47.123 --> 02:49.169
And you clearly
don't know me at all.

02:50.474 --> 02:52.824
OK. Now.

02:52.824 --> 02:55.914
We got most wanted.
Wanted most.

02:55.914 --> 02:57.394
Take 'em both.
Decide later.

♪ ...happy when it rains ♪

02:58.787 --> 03:00.963

03:03.095 --> 03:05.881
well, $1,200 jacket
and the matching kicks.

03:05.881 --> 03:07.491
♪ ...sad, sad songs ♪

03:07.491 --> 03:09.580
We discussed this.
It's more of a loan.

03:09.580 --> 03:12.061
Once we clear our names,
we're paying it back.

03:12.061 --> 03:14.281
Right. Just as soon as
the store pays back

03:14.281 --> 03:16.544
all the child labor
they exploited to make
this stuff.

03:16.544 --> 03:18.981
Well, you know if you
victimize the victimizer,

03:18.981 --> 03:20.591
then it's a victimless crime.

03:20.591 --> 03:22.811
I'm not sure the law
sees it that way.

03:22.811 --> 03:25.117
Just as long as they
don't see you, right?

03:27.816 --> 03:29.252
Not exactly my style.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.601
Mm-hmm.
That's the point.

03:30.601 --> 03:31.776
We gotta change up
our looks so that

03:31.776 --> 03:33.691
we don't match
our mugshots.

03:33.691 --> 03:35.345
I really wish they'd
taken that turtleneck

03:35.345 --> 03:36.825
when they seized
your trust fund.

03:38.087 --> 03:41.525
Hey. You're a fugitive
now, OK?

03:41.525 --> 03:43.832
You are no longer required
to be this boring.

03:43.832 --> 03:45.573
Come on.
What happened
to that guy who

03:45.573 --> 03:47.879
grabbed the wheel
and wrecked
the prison transport?

03:47.879 --> 03:49.968
That guy that I know
you keep tucked away,

03:49.968 --> 03:52.057
hiding underneath
all that cashmere?

03:53.581 --> 03:55.496
Let me know when he wants
to come out and play.

03:58.586 --> 04:00.240
OK, who tripped
the silent alarm?

04:03.330 --> 04:04.766
Attention, shoplifters,

04:04.766 --> 04:06.420
please make
your final selections

04:06.420 --> 04:09.074
and kindly bring them
towards the rear exit.

04:24.220 --> 04:26.962
Carrie?
What are you doing here?

04:26.962 --> 04:28.703
Responding to
a burglary in progress.

04:35.623 --> 04:36.841
You know anything
about that?

04:58.167 --> 05:00.474
As the manhunt continues
for Turner Hayes

05:00.474 --> 05:02.040
and the band of criminals
wanted for

05:02.040 --> 05:03.607
the murder of Bruce Wayne,

05:03.607 --> 05:05.043
Mayor Hill announced
that he's created

05:05.043 --> 05:06.828
a blue ribbon task force

05:06.828 --> 05:09.439
spearheaded by
District Attorney Harvey Dent

05:09.439 --> 05:11.311
to apprehend the fugitives.

05:11.311 --> 05:13.922
No matter where the hunt leads,
we'll drag those killers

05:13.922 --> 05:17.621
out of whatever sleaze-infested
back alley they're holed up in.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.366
Um, I do not see
what the big deal is.

05:23.366 --> 05:25.281
I just needed to pick up
some accessories.

05:25.281 --> 05:27.979
You're all supposed
to be keeping a low profile.

05:27.979 --> 05:31.418
Oh, and dyeing your hair blue
isn't exactly blending in.

05:31.418 --> 05:32.593
This is Gotham.

05:32.593 --> 05:33.898
You blend in
by standing out.

05:33.898 --> 05:35.596
We needed supplies.

05:35.596 --> 05:37.249
Sure, we have our run
of this place at night.

05:37.249 --> 05:39.600
Food from the kitchen.
Showers in the gym.

05:39.600 --> 05:41.341
But clothes are
another story.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.255
Trust me--
the lost and found

05:43.255 --> 05:45.083
is... slim pickings.

05:46.563 --> 05:48.260
But committing crime
isn't the best way

05:48.260 --> 05:49.784
to prove you're innocent.

05:49.784 --> 05:52.134
And how are we
supposed to do that?

05:52.134 --> 05:54.005
Our leads don't
lead anywhere,

05:54.005 --> 05:55.093
and that detective
who tried to

05:55.093 --> 05:57.313
frame/kill us is dirty.

05:57.313 --> 05:59.576
So, have fun calling
the cops on a cop.

05:59.576 --> 06:00.751
And I'm not sure
how many clues we can get

06:00.751 --> 06:02.231
from a watch engraved with

06:02.231 --> 06:04.102
the symbol of some
evil bird cult.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.757
Laugh while you can.

06:06.757 --> 06:08.672
Court of Owls controls
this entire city.

06:08.672 --> 06:10.195
They have eyes everywhere.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.023
And yet no one
has ever seen them.

06:12.023 --> 06:13.764
No one who lived
to tell about it.

06:13.764 --> 06:15.375
Right, right,
right, right.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.464
"Speak not a whispered
word of them

06:17.464 --> 06:19.509
or they'll send the Talon
for your head."

06:21.032 --> 06:22.730
Let's just tell the cops.

06:22.730 --> 06:24.993
No, really.
A nursery rhyme did it.

06:26.255 --> 06:28.083
She's right.

06:28.083 --> 06:29.911
We need something a little
more tangible to go on.

06:31.129 --> 06:32.435
I have a friend
working on that.

06:44.273 --> 06:45.840
First two periods
are cancelled,

06:45.840 --> 06:46.928
and they're having
an assembly to

06:46.928 --> 06:48.712
talk to us
about Turner.

06:48.712 --> 06:50.453
You'd think your classmate
becoming the most wanted

06:50.453 --> 06:52.673
fugitive in Gotham
since Ed Nygma

06:52.673 --> 06:53.674
would give us
the whole day off.

06:53.674 --> 06:54.762
He didn't do it, OK?

06:54.762 --> 06:56.154
Come on.

06:56.154 --> 06:57.199
Money from his
bank account was

06:57.199 --> 06:58.200
paid to the killers.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.201
And if he were guilty,

06:59.201 --> 07:00.420
then why would he ask me

07:00.420 --> 07:01.464
to hack the banks
to find out

07:01.464 --> 07:03.118
how that money got there?

07:03.118 --> 07:04.989
You--you did what?

07:06.556 --> 07:07.775
Used his dad's
Batcomputer

07:07.775 --> 07:09.646
to try to prove
he was innocent.

07:09.646 --> 07:11.169
I'm sorry.
I'm just trying
to figure out

07:11.169 --> 07:13.520
which part of that
sounds more insane--

07:13.520 --> 07:15.696
the fact that
you hacked the city's
financial infrastructure

07:15.696 --> 07:17.785
or that you did it
on a Batcomputer.

07:19.526 --> 07:21.049
Do you understand
how much trouble
you could've gotten in?

07:21.049 --> 07:22.833
I'm more worried about
the trouble he's in,

07:22.833 --> 07:24.313
because I'm his friend.

07:24.313 --> 07:25.706
Well, you could become
an accessory

07:25.706 --> 07:27.142
if you keep helping him.

07:27.142 --> 07:29.971
Steph. He's going
to get caught,

07:29.971 --> 07:32.452
and when he does,
he's gonna bring you
down with him.

07:32.452 --> 07:33.496
I mean, the guy
couldn't even figure out

07:33.496 --> 07:35.280
his dad was Batman.

07:35.280 --> 07:37.631
Where the hell
is he gonna hide?

08:33.861 --> 08:36.254
Hmm. Looks like someone

08:36.254 --> 08:39.388
took a wrong turn
at cheerleader tryouts.

08:39.388 --> 08:41.085
We don't have cheerleaders
at this school.

08:41.085 --> 08:43.000
Hmm. Their loss,
'cause you are

08:43.000 --> 08:45.176
rockin' that skirt, blondie.

08:46.482 --> 08:48.832
Thank you.
Duela!

08:48.832 --> 08:51.139
Duela, let her go.

08:51.139 --> 08:52.706
She's my friend.
You can trust her.

08:52.706 --> 08:53.968
I don't trust you.

08:53.968 --> 08:55.273
Who the hell is she?

08:55.273 --> 08:57.406
Stephanie. Hi.

08:57.406 --> 08:59.626
I thought you said
no one else knew
about this place.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.932
She's the only other person.
Duela, put the knife down.

09:01.932 --> 09:03.281
Or what?
Or you might

09:03.281 --> 09:04.413
kill the one person
who can

09:04.413 --> 09:06.241
prove we were set up.

09:06.241 --> 09:07.285
She's looking into
where the money

09:07.285 --> 09:08.591
you were paid came from.

09:08.591 --> 09:09.984
This is
the hacker chick?

09:09.984 --> 09:12.116
Hacker chick. Hi.

09:12.116 --> 09:15.424
Stephanie... Brown?

09:15.424 --> 09:17.165
As in Arthur Brown?

09:18.862 --> 09:21.430
Are you the daughter
of the "Quiz Bowl" host?

09:21.430 --> 09:22.953
I think I prefer
"Hacker chick."

09:24.520 --> 09:27.001
'Cause that is what
this group was missing.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.959
A celebrity
game show host's kid.

09:28.959 --> 09:30.439
So, you're the one
who's gonna take

09:30.439 --> 09:31.919
all those ones and zeros

09:31.919 --> 09:33.311
and make 'em
prove we're innocent?

09:33.311 --> 09:34.878
That was the plan,

09:34.878 --> 09:36.271
until the GCPD impounded

09:36.271 --> 09:37.620
everything in the Batcave.

09:39.317 --> 09:40.580
So, the Batcomputer?

09:51.895 --> 09:54.637
Harvey, have you
seen Detective Ford?

09:54.637 --> 09:56.291
Uh, not in a while.

09:56.291 --> 09:58.293
He's been dodging
my calls.

09:58.293 --> 10:00.034
Well, he better not
dodge mine.

10:07.563 --> 10:09.391
Is that his phone?

10:47.168 --> 10:48.517
We better
check on his team.

10:49.866 --> 10:51.389
Uh--uh.

11:09.407 --> 11:11.888
6 members of the GCPD task force

11:11.888 --> 11:13.716
assigned to hunt down
the fugitives

11:13.716 --> 11:15.979
wanted for the murder
of Bruce Wayne

11:15.979 --> 11:18.721
have themselves
been found murdered.

11:18.721 --> 11:21.550
The gruesome discovery
was made earlier this morning.

11:21.550 --> 11:23.508
The GCPD declined to comment

11:23.508 --> 11:25.902
on an ongoing investigation,

11:25.902 --> 11:27.991
but sources within
the department say that

11:27.991 --> 11:31.342
each of those detectives
was decapitated.

11:33.867 --> 11:36.217
"Or they'll send the Talon
for your head."

11:39.133 --> 11:41.222
Oh! Oh, I'm sorry.
What was that?

11:41.222 --> 11:42.832
Maybe--maybe Duela
was right about

11:42.832 --> 11:44.442
how dangerous and--
say it with me now--

11:44.442 --> 11:46.270
how real
the Court of Owls is.

11:46.270 --> 11:47.968
Why would they kill
Ford and his men?

11:47.968 --> 11:49.534
Because they screwed up
killing us.

11:49.534 --> 11:52.363
OK, OK.
Say they are real.

11:52.363 --> 11:54.017
Who is gonna believe us?

11:54.017 --> 11:55.540
My dad would've.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.325
If the world's greatest
detective was found

11:57.325 --> 11:59.196
holding a Court of
Owls coin,

11:59.196 --> 12:01.068
I'll bet he knew
something about them.

12:01.068 --> 12:02.983
Maybe he got
too close to them

12:02.983 --> 12:04.593
and that's what
got him killed.

12:04.593 --> 12:06.203
Oh, and now you want us
to end up just like him?

12:06.203 --> 12:09.206
No. I want to pick up
where he left off.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.860
And how do we do that?

12:10.860 --> 12:11.992
There is one way.

12:13.863 --> 12:15.517
But it's a terrible idea.

12:15.517 --> 12:17.040
Never stopped us before.

12:17.040 --> 12:18.607
They got
Bruce's journals.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.087
He kept records of
all of his cases.

12:20.087 --> 12:21.871
I never saw any journals
in the house.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.394
That's because
they're not in there.

12:23.394 --> 12:25.483
Um, they're in
his office in Wayne Tower

12:25.483 --> 12:26.963
in a secret compartment.

12:26.963 --> 12:28.269
We'd have to
break in to get them.

12:34.579 --> 12:36.799
You're right.
That is a terrible idea.

12:36.799 --> 12:37.887
But we need to find out
everything we can

12:37.887 --> 12:39.280
about who's after us,

12:39.280 --> 12:40.977
and who would know
better than

12:40.977 --> 12:43.893
the last person
they targeted?
My dad.

12:43.893 --> 12:44.938
You know, this isn't like
breaking into

12:44.938 --> 12:46.940
Daddy's liquor cabinet.

12:46.940 --> 12:49.029
I know.
It's more like
something the guy

12:49.029 --> 12:50.117
who grabbed the wheel
and wrecked

12:50.117 --> 12:51.901
the transport would do.

12:51.901 --> 12:53.511
So, you swipe
one leather jacket

12:53.511 --> 12:55.513
and suddenly you're
a master thief?

12:55.513 --> 12:57.341
No. But it's
a good thing I know

12:57.341 --> 12:59.082
some people who are.

13:18.275 --> 13:20.234
You do realize
the first rule they teach you

13:20.234 --> 13:21.670
in thief school
is never return to

13:21.670 --> 13:23.933
the scene of a crime, right?

13:23.933 --> 13:25.717
Since when do you
follow the rules?

13:25.717 --> 13:28.068
Uh, since Daddy's
power tower became

13:28.068 --> 13:30.722
the most famous crime scene
in the history of Gotham.

13:30.722 --> 13:32.812
Not to mention
they'll have doubled
the security,

13:32.812 --> 13:34.465
restored the motion sensors
we disabled,

13:34.465 --> 13:36.250
and have redundant
cameras covering

13:36.250 --> 13:37.947
every way in or out.

13:37.947 --> 13:39.035
All but one.

13:41.081 --> 13:43.387
My dad had
a private elevator.

13:43.387 --> 13:44.998
Goes all the way
from the lowest level
of the garage

13:44.998 --> 13:46.216
to his office.

13:46.216 --> 13:47.435
Bypasses every security camera

13:47.435 --> 13:49.480
and guard in between.

13:49.480 --> 13:51.743
I always thought
it was so he could
avoid the press.

13:51.743 --> 13:53.310
I guess it turns out
it was because
he couldn't exactly

13:53.310 --> 13:55.486
roll through the lobby
dressed as Batman.

13:57.445 --> 13:58.838
OK, but to even
access the elevator,

13:58.838 --> 14:00.491
we need to break into
the garage,

14:00.491 --> 14:01.536
and Wayne Security
patrols search

14:01.536 --> 14:02.537
all the cars going in.

14:02.537 --> 14:03.625
Except their own.

14:05.279 --> 14:07.672
My dad used to say
that every strength
is secretly a weakness.

14:07.672 --> 14:10.197
OK, all due respect to
Daddy's Batproverbs,

14:10.197 --> 14:11.676
but what the hell
does that mean?

14:11.676 --> 14:13.200
It means the most
vulnerable areas

14:13.200 --> 14:14.679
are the ones you're
not worried about.

14:14.679 --> 14:16.246
Wayne Security vehicles
are equipped with

14:16.246 --> 14:18.031
transponders that
automatically open the gates.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.207
Their way of
keeping people out
is our way in.

14:20.207 --> 14:22.296
Oh, OK, so, your solution to
breaking into a building

14:22.296 --> 14:23.645
is breaking into a car.

14:25.299 --> 14:27.388
Nobody has to risk
any more than
they already have.

14:27.388 --> 14:28.693
I can go in alone.

14:28.693 --> 14:30.913
Not gonna happen.
I'm in.

14:30.913 --> 14:32.001
Ugh.

14:33.524 --> 14:35.004
You're gonna need someone
to keep the engine running.

14:35.004 --> 14:36.919
And if
you want to even

14:36.919 --> 14:39.487
get the engine running,
you're gonna need me.

14:42.011 --> 14:43.578
I was hoping
you'd say that,

14:43.578 --> 14:44.884
because I just happen
to know where a couple of

14:44.884 --> 14:45.885
Wayne Security vehicles

14:45.885 --> 14:47.190
might be lying around.

14:50.367 --> 14:52.282
Whatever gets me
out of this attic.

14:55.111 --> 14:58.332
Mayor Hill: Do you like numbers?
I do.

14:58.332 --> 15:01.422
They're the only things in
this city that don't lie.

15:01.422 --> 15:03.641
So, let's
talk numbers.

15:03.641 --> 15:06.427
7. That's how many
toe tags

15:06.427 --> 15:08.168
our fugitives
have racked up.

15:08.168 --> 15:10.126
6. That's how many
grieving families

15:10.126 --> 15:11.562
I've just had to
talk to,

15:11.562 --> 15:14.739
and they all have
exactly one question.

15:14.739 --> 15:17.264
When are we gonna
catch 'em?

15:17.264 --> 15:19.048
But you know the number
that I'm most worried about?

15:19.048 --> 15:21.007
34--your approval rating?

15:21.007 --> 15:24.401
Zero, which is how many
leads you've got.

15:24.401 --> 15:27.448
Actually, there is one.

15:27.448 --> 15:29.232
Financial Crimes
sent this over.

15:29.232 --> 15:30.668
The night of
the convoy escape,

15:30.668 --> 15:33.367
every bank in Gotham
was hacked.

15:33.367 --> 15:34.803
They were digging
through accounts

15:34.803 --> 15:36.326
belonging to
Turner Hayes.

15:36.326 --> 15:37.762
If they were escaping
from the convoy,

15:37.762 --> 15:38.763
then Turner couldn't have been

15:38.763 --> 15:40.461
hacking into banks.

15:40.461 --> 15:41.766
So, somebody's
helping him.

15:43.203 --> 15:45.901
After he was arrested,
who was his one phone call?

15:51.341 --> 15:54.475
Ms. Brown.
Would you come
with us, please?

15:54.475 --> 15:55.824
Is that a question?

15:55.824 --> 15:57.869
More of a courtesy.
Let's go.

17:00.062 --> 17:01.063
We're clear.

17:03.196 --> 17:05.285
Not too bad for
a trust funder.

17:05.285 --> 17:07.243
You know I wasn't
always rich, right?

17:07.243 --> 17:09.028
Here we go.

17:09.028 --> 17:10.638
Didn't think I'd
be back this soon,

17:10.638 --> 17:12.205
did you, Wayne Tower?

17:12.205 --> 17:13.423
Looks like somebody
gave you a brand-new

17:13.423 --> 17:14.555
set of motion sensors.

17:14.555 --> 17:16.774
I'll be accessing those.

17:16.774 --> 17:18.907
And your cameras.

17:18.907 --> 17:20.517
OK. No patrol
on the top level.

17:20.517 --> 17:22.258
You two are
good to go.

17:22.258 --> 17:23.520
We'll monitor
you two from here.

17:23.520 --> 17:25.044
Be another pair of eyes.

17:25.044 --> 17:26.741
And your fists if
it comes to that.

17:26.741 --> 17:28.134
Let's hope it doesn't.

17:28.134 --> 17:29.222
You guys are
gonna do great.

17:29.222 --> 17:30.353
Come on.

17:30.353 --> 17:31.876
We're on a tight timeline

17:31.876 --> 17:33.400
and I have an AP history
paper to write.

17:36.011 --> 17:38.448
You think these
journals have anything
in them about the Court?

17:38.448 --> 17:39.928
I think
we're about to find out.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.847
Um, probably the
wrong time to ask this,

17:45.847 --> 17:47.022
but what do
you think happens

17:47.022 --> 17:48.545
if they changed
my dad's code?

17:48.545 --> 17:49.851
Two dozen
heavily armed guards

17:49.851 --> 17:51.331
descend on
this very spot.

18:19.141 --> 18:21.317
OK, what's with
the team spirit
all of a sudden?

18:21.317 --> 18:22.579
You never went along
with a plan

18:22.579 --> 18:24.015
you didn't
come up with yourself.

18:24.015 --> 18:25.104
All right.

18:26.627 --> 18:29.891
Going along with Turner's plan
is a part of my plan,

18:29.891 --> 18:31.675
one that involves getting
the hell out of Gotham,

18:31.675 --> 18:33.329
and I was just about to
invite you two to join me.

18:33.329 --> 18:35.070
What about
clearing your name?

18:35.070 --> 18:36.593
I would rather
keep it off a tombstone.

18:36.593 --> 18:37.594
And you know, besides,
if we check out of here,

18:37.594 --> 18:38.682
we get new names.

18:40.293 --> 18:41.511
I'm kinda digging
the name Harper.

18:43.339 --> 18:44.949
Whoa. Kidding.
Hate that name.

18:44.949 --> 18:46.560
Look, I'm just saying
that if--

18:46.560 --> 18:48.170
if proving we're innocent
means breaking into

18:48.170 --> 18:49.389
a place that we were very lucky

18:49.389 --> 18:50.520
to get out of the first time,

18:50.520 --> 18:51.695
we are better off running.

18:51.695 --> 18:53.262
Yeah, it takes
money to run.

18:53.262 --> 18:54.742
I got that covered.
I did some asking around

18:54.742 --> 18:57.048
and this creepy,
little timepiece

18:57.048 --> 18:58.963
is worth a whole lot more
than we figured.

18:58.963 --> 19:00.356
An antiquities dealer
over on Brundle

19:00.356 --> 19:01.575
offered up a number that splits

19:01.575 --> 19:03.577
very nicely 3 ways.

19:03.577 --> 19:06.928
And then what?
Every way out of the city
is a GCPD checkpoint.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.538
What makes you think you can
dodge that much heat?

19:08.538 --> 19:10.453
You're sitting in it.

19:12.716 --> 19:15.284
The--the GCPD isn't searching
Wayne Security vehicles.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.808
That'd be like searching
the president's motorcade.

19:17.808 --> 19:19.767
Heh. This comfort ride beauty

19:19.767 --> 19:21.508
is our luxury ticket
outta G-town.

19:23.074 --> 19:24.641
Come on.

19:24.641 --> 19:26.382
I'll even let you pick
the radio station.

19:49.318 --> 19:51.668
This is the last place
he was alive.

19:57.587 --> 19:59.459
Come on.

19:59.459 --> 20:00.590
We don't have
much time.

20:33.580 --> 20:35.669
It's a good thing
you know your way around.

20:44.678 --> 20:46.723
That his most recent one?

20:46.723 --> 20:48.464
No, it's from when
he was just a kid.

20:49.987 --> 20:51.467
It's all about the murder
of his parents.

20:53.208 --> 20:54.340
This was his first case.

20:57.168 --> 20:58.431
Wonder what made him
dig that out.

21:01.172 --> 21:04.088
Listen to this.
"Everyone, even Alfred,

21:04.088 --> 21:06.526
"believed that a lone thief
was responsible.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.223
"Joe Chill may have
pulled the trigger,

21:08.223 --> 21:09.920
but he didn't
orchestrate the murder."

21:11.792 --> 21:13.228
"The Court of Owls did."

21:18.842 --> 21:20.888
Heh. You seriously
can't be thinking of

21:20.888 --> 21:22.585
taking off
with her.

21:22.585 --> 21:24.587
Just because she's deranged
doesn't mean she's wrong.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.763
True.
Staying in Gotham
is suicide.

21:26.763 --> 21:30.027
Also true.
I'm so tired of running.

21:30.027 --> 21:31.812
All right?
First from Dad,
now from this.

21:31.812 --> 21:33.988
Yeah, a 6 by 9 cell
in Blackgate will fix that.

21:33.988 --> 21:35.946
But they'll probably just
skip straight to a coffin,

21:35.946 --> 21:38.035
which is a lot less roomy.

21:38.035 --> 21:39.776
Do you even care
about what happens
to Turner and Carrie?

21:39.776 --> 21:41.996
Not particularly.
No one's talking to you.

21:41.996 --> 21:43.737
I care about
what happens to you.

21:43.737 --> 21:44.825
And if that were true,
you wouldn't be

21:44.825 --> 21:46.957
asking me to run.

21:46.957 --> 21:48.959
Cullen, what?
I want to stay
and clear my name

21:48.959 --> 21:50.787
not only because,
you know, I chose

21:50.787 --> 21:53.137
the damn thing, but because
it's finally my choice.

21:53.137 --> 21:55.444
You want to go
with her? Go.

21:55.444 --> 21:57.185
I'm staying for
Turner and Carrie.

21:58.447 --> 21:59.448
And for me.

22:06.368 --> 22:08.196
Look, I know you want
to help Turner.

22:10.241 --> 22:11.547
And so do I.

22:12.766 --> 22:14.333
I really want to believe
that he's innocent.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.117
You can't seriously think
he had anything to do

22:16.117 --> 22:18.772
with murdering his dad or
any of those detectives.

22:18.772 --> 22:23.167
No. But I would buy it
from the Joker's daughter.

22:23.167 --> 22:24.386
And the longer
he's on the run

22:24.386 --> 22:25.866
with criminals like her,

22:25.866 --> 22:27.433
the guiltier he looks.

22:29.522 --> 22:32.307
Just tell me where Turner is
so I can help him.

22:32.307 --> 22:33.482
Before it's too late.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.573
Is holding a press conference
to announce a manhunt

22:37.573 --> 22:39.227
your idea of helping Turner?

22:39.227 --> 22:43.449
Is hacking into every bank
in Gotham yours?

22:43.449 --> 22:45.320
You know, not many of
Turner's friends

22:45.320 --> 22:47.453
have a 4.0 in
computer science, so,

22:47.453 --> 22:51.282
it seems like you certainly
have the skills.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.546
Theft of corporate
and financial data

22:53.546 --> 22:57.332
carries a 5-year
prison sentence, minimum.

22:57.332 --> 22:59.029
So, I need you
to level with me.

23:00.727 --> 23:03.556
OK. I know two things.

23:03.556 --> 23:06.167
One, Turner is innocent.

23:06.167 --> 23:08.648
And two, if you had
any proof against me

23:08.648 --> 23:10.040
other than my list
of electives,

23:10.040 --> 23:11.651
I'd be in handcuffs
right now.

23:13.174 --> 23:15.394
And I know not to say
anything else
without an attorney.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.222
Sorry. That was 3 things.

23:18.222 --> 23:19.702
Yeah.

23:29.930 --> 23:33.237
You don't want to talk.
OK. Fine.

23:34.935 --> 23:36.371
Looks like there's
someone who does.

23:38.199 --> 23:39.505
Yup.

23:39.505 --> 23:40.680
OK. You sure?

23:46.250 --> 23:48.818
Why would the Court
kill Bruce's parents?

23:48.818 --> 23:50.994
I don't know.
And according to this,

23:50.994 --> 23:52.866
it didn't start
with them.

23:52.866 --> 23:54.084
He believed they murdered
his great-great-grandfather

23:54.084 --> 23:55.651
Alan Wayne.

23:55.651 --> 23:57.000
The guy who
designed this building?

23:57.000 --> 23:58.741
Yeah. My dad suspected

23:58.741 --> 24:00.526
the Court had been hunting
Waynes for decades.

24:00.526 --> 24:03.224
Centuries, even.
He was obsessed with it.

24:03.224 --> 24:05.182
He drew maps,
every corner of the city,

24:05.182 --> 24:06.836
trying to locate where
they gathered in secret.

24:06.836 --> 24:07.924
What did he find?

24:09.970 --> 24:11.014
Nothing.

24:14.365 --> 24:16.846
"In the end, all I was
certain of

24:16.846 --> 24:18.892
"was that the Court
was a fairytale.

24:18.892 --> 24:20.415
"No more than
a nursery rhyme

24:20.415 --> 24:22.199
"made up to
scare children.

24:22.199 --> 24:24.941
"The only thing real was
my obsession with them.

24:24.941 --> 24:28.728
Despite my efforts,
I found no evidence
they ever existed."

24:28.728 --> 24:30.643
I don't get it.
He was investigating
the Court when he died.

24:30.643 --> 24:32.819
Something must have
changed his mind.

24:32.819 --> 24:34.995
Maybe it's in
his last journal.

24:37.171 --> 24:38.825
Uh, what's that?

24:38.825 --> 24:40.479
Security alert.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.785
Uh, guys?
All the security cameras

24:42.785 --> 24:44.352
in the building
just went offline.

24:44.352 --> 24:46.180
That's great.
How'd you manage that?

24:46.180 --> 24:48.138
I didn't.
And I don't think

24:48.138 --> 24:49.705
security did,
either, because

24:49.705 --> 24:51.098
they just notified
the GCPD

24:51.098 --> 24:52.273
of a possible intrusion.

24:52.273 --> 24:53.840
And now

24:53.840 --> 24:55.232
the motion sensors are
going off on your floor.

24:56.973 --> 24:58.453
Security?
No. There's no
patrols on your level.

24:58.453 --> 24:59.976
Then who the hell is it?
I don't know,

24:59.976 --> 25:03.110
but if you don't hurry,
you're gonna find out.

25:03.110 --> 25:04.677
We're packing up now.
Got his last journal.

25:04.677 --> 25:05.982
Come on.
Let's go.

25:35.969 --> 25:40.408
Guys, talk to me.
Guys, what's happening?

25:40.408 --> 25:42.715
I think we just
met the Talon.

25:46.806 --> 25:48.677
What the hell is that?

25:48.677 --> 25:50.331
Security alert
just went building wide.

25:50.331 --> 25:51.898
Wayne Security is

25:51.898 --> 25:53.290
on their way up to you
right now.

25:54.509 --> 25:55.815
Oh. Fun.

25:55.815 --> 25:57.077
GCPD is already inbound.

25:57.077 --> 25:58.644
You need to get
out of there.

25:58.644 --> 25:59.949
A little stuck
right now.

26:07.391 --> 26:08.567
We've gotta go help them.

26:19.360 --> 26:20.883
Duela, no.
They're about to be

26:20.883 --> 26:22.406
the meat in
a cop-Talon sandwich.

26:22.406 --> 26:24.365
This is your last chance
to stay alive.

26:24.365 --> 26:25.496
You can go with her
if you want.

26:25.496 --> 26:26.759
Not without you.

26:26.759 --> 26:27.934
Duela, you can't do this.

26:27.934 --> 26:29.413
You can't just
abandon them.

26:29.413 --> 26:31.633
Why not, Cullen?
Everyone abandoned me.

26:31.633 --> 26:33.026
Enough times for me to know that

26:33.026 --> 26:34.418
no one would ever come save me.

26:54.743 --> 26:57.616
Let's go!

26:57.616 --> 26:58.747
Come on, come on!

27:04.013 --> 27:05.885
Uhh!

27:05.885 --> 27:06.973
Aah!

27:08.496 --> 27:10.063
Uhh!

27:10.063 --> 27:11.934
Could use some help
here, guys.

27:20.726 --> 27:22.597
Come on, guys, we have to go.

27:22.597 --> 27:24.686
Can't get out that way.
Garage is crawling with GCPD.

27:24.686 --> 27:26.253
Well,
we're definitely not
getting out that way.

27:26.253 --> 27:29.996
Then we're trapped.
Uhh! Uhh!

27:29.996 --> 27:31.127
There is one way.

27:34.174 --> 27:35.262
How? Climb?

27:35.262 --> 27:37.568
No. We fly.

27:41.703 --> 27:43.662
Have you ever used
that thing before?

27:43.662 --> 27:45.533
Don't answer that.

27:45.533 --> 27:48.014
It's a 48-story drop, so,

27:48.014 --> 27:50.364
you know... don't let go.

28:28.924 --> 28:29.925
Ahem.

28:34.843 --> 28:36.845
As advertised.

28:36.845 --> 28:39.021
Genuine Sicolo.
Limited edition.

28:39.021 --> 28:41.110
Skeleton dial.
Polished camphors.

28:41.110 --> 28:43.069
Tells time, too.

28:43.069 --> 28:45.636
You neglected to mention
an engraving.

28:45.636 --> 28:48.509
OK, so, knock a few bucks
off the sticker price.

28:48.509 --> 28:51.251
It's quite a unique feature.

28:51.251 --> 28:54.254
Is this what makes it
so sought-after?

28:55.864 --> 28:57.823
What do you mean,
sought-after?

28:57.823 --> 29:00.826
When I called around
to ascertain the value,

29:00.826 --> 29:02.479
there was
one potential buyer

29:02.479 --> 29:06.353
who was quite interested
in this particular model.

29:06.353 --> 29:08.398
Willing to pay a fortune.

29:08.398 --> 29:12.011
And willing to pay
even more

29:12.011 --> 29:14.230
for the person
selling it.

29:21.760 --> 29:23.022
I don't get it.
Why would Duela

29:23.022 --> 29:24.197
screw us over like that?

29:24.197 --> 29:25.328
She's
the Joker's daughter.

29:25.328 --> 29:26.721
I'm surprised it
took her this long.

29:26.721 --> 29:28.418
How much could
she have possibly

29:28.418 --> 29:29.855
been offered
for that watch?

29:29.855 --> 29:31.421
I'm not sure you want to
put a price tag on betrayal

29:31.421 --> 29:32.945
but I'm pretty sure
a personalized engraving

29:32.945 --> 29:34.990
makes it worth
less, not more.

29:34.990 --> 29:37.558
That depends on the buyer

29:37.558 --> 29:38.733
and the engraving.

29:43.390 --> 29:46.349
Oh, please tell me
you are not this stupid.

29:46.349 --> 29:49.526
Unwise to insult
the person holding the gun.

29:49.526 --> 29:50.745
Considering what's coming,

29:50.745 --> 29:52.791
I would rather be shot.

29:52.791 --> 29:55.010
You have no idea
who you're dealing with.

29:55.010 --> 29:57.230
Nor do I care.

29:57.230 --> 30:00.189
At this price point,
I don't ask questions.

30:00.189 --> 30:03.584
Look... whatever
they're paying you

30:03.584 --> 30:05.934
will be going towards
your funeral costs, OK,

30:05.934 --> 30:07.806
because the Court of Owls
is not really in the--

30:07.806 --> 30:09.503
the leaving loose ends
kind of business,

30:09.503 --> 30:10.939
and that's what both
of us are dealing--

30:52.938 --> 30:55.288
Aah!

31:28.974 --> 31:30.714
No-no-no-no-no-no-no.

31:40.115 --> 31:41.073
Uhh!

31:41.073 --> 31:42.639
No!

31:47.166 --> 31:48.689
Aah! Uhh!

32:00.483 --> 32:01.832
Uhh.

32:05.358 --> 32:06.663
Uhh.

32:06.663 --> 32:08.448
Huh?

32:13.279 --> 32:14.889
Uhh.

32:47.182 --> 32:49.924
Hey! Come on!
Get me out of here!

33:11.293 --> 33:12.686
Aah!

33:12.686 --> 33:13.817
Hit the deck!

33:34.490 --> 33:36.188
How many more of those
you got?

33:36.188 --> 33:37.493
Not enough.

33:40.757 --> 33:42.107
- Run!
- Yeah.

33:46.415 --> 33:47.460
Uhh.

34:07.828 --> 34:09.177
Thanks.

34:09.177 --> 34:10.831
Just change it
every 12 hours.

34:10.831 --> 34:12.876
No, I mean for
coming back for me.

34:12.876 --> 34:13.964
Don't thank us.

34:15.227 --> 34:17.055
If we'd gone with
you, we'd be dead.

34:17.055 --> 34:18.708
And if it were up to us,
we would've left your ass.

34:19.927 --> 34:22.538
You want to thank someone?
Thank him.

34:33.984 --> 34:36.596
That was pretty stupid,
you know,

34:36.596 --> 34:37.814
thinking that you
could go up against

34:37.814 --> 34:38.989
the Talon like that.

34:40.252 --> 34:41.905
I had help.

34:41.905 --> 34:44.299
I guess that's why
I'm still alive.

34:59.009 --> 35:00.837
But if we stick together,
we have a better shot

35:00.837 --> 35:01.925
at keeping
the Court of Owls

35:01.925 --> 35:03.188
from doing it for us.

35:04.450 --> 35:05.668
Well, you almost
got kabobed

35:05.668 --> 35:07.061
getting Daddy's diary.

35:08.410 --> 35:09.411
Was it worth it?

35:11.152 --> 35:12.110
Yeah.

35:13.459 --> 35:15.504

you know.

35:26.515 --> 35:27.995
It's nice to know
Bruce Wayne's kid

35:27.995 --> 35:29.910
can wield more
than a dessert fork.

35:31.825 --> 35:33.870
You know, back in
my old neighborhood,

35:33.870 --> 35:36.308
all I wanted was
to play street hockey.

35:36.308 --> 35:38.179
But when I was adopted,
my dad insisted

35:38.179 --> 35:41.269
that I learn martial arts
and fencing,

35:41.269 --> 35:42.705
to get good at them,
be the best.

35:42.705 --> 35:44.664
Lucky for you he did.

35:44.664 --> 35:46.535
I don't think
it was luck,

35:46.535 --> 35:47.710
or coincidence.

35:49.408 --> 35:50.539
Makes me wonder
what else he might've

You think ratting me out
is gonna

36:05.902 --> 36:06.947
stop me from
helping Turner?

36:06.947 --> 36:08.166
I didn't rat you out.

36:08.166 --> 36:09.428
Oh, really?
Oh, what were you

36:09.428 --> 36:10.559
in there doing
for over an hour?

36:13.475 --> 36:15.173
I told them
that I did it,

36:15.173 --> 36:17.958
that I was the one
who hacked those banks.

36:17.958 --> 36:19.046
What?
I said that Turner

36:19.046 --> 36:20.613
asked you to do it, but

36:20.613 --> 36:21.614
you didn't wanna
break the law for him,

36:21.614 --> 36:23.703
so, I did it.

36:23.703 --> 36:25.095
To help my friend.

36:26.662 --> 36:27.837
Why would you do that?

36:31.014 --> 36:32.190
I just couldn't sit here
and watch you

36:32.190 --> 36:33.669
screw up your life.

36:33.669 --> 36:35.018
Not for that guy.

36:35.018 --> 36:37.151
What about you?
Weren't you the one

36:37.151 --> 36:38.805
lecturing me on
getting in trouble?

36:38.805 --> 36:40.676
Just as long as I can
keep you out of it.

36:41.938 --> 36:42.983
I can't let you do that.

36:42.983 --> 36:45.072
You didn't ask me to.

36:45.072 --> 36:47.248
I guess that's
the difference between
me and Turner.

36:59.782 --> 37:01.741
System says that
they accessed the building

37:01.741 --> 37:03.960
using Bruce Wayne's
personal code.

37:03.960 --> 37:05.962
What was taken?

37:05.962 --> 37:09.139
According to the inventory,
just the sword.

37:11.446 --> 37:13.666
Why risk coming back
for a sword?

37:13.666 --> 37:15.624
I don't know.

37:15.624 --> 37:17.191
Might want to ask
the antiquities dealer

37:17.191 --> 37:18.540
we found impaled by one.

37:30.117 --> 37:32.685
"They watch you
at your hearth."

37:32.685 --> 37:33.860
Indeed.

37:36.732 --> 37:38.995
I'm merely
the messenger.

37:38.995 --> 37:41.346
Well, I could've
saved you the trip.

37:41.346 --> 37:43.304
Please let the Court know
that I'm as unhappy

37:43.304 --> 37:46.046
with the hunt for Turner Hayes
and the others as they are,

37:46.046 --> 37:47.917
and you can assure them that
apprehending the fugitives

37:47.917 --> 37:49.919
is my top priority.

37:49.919 --> 37:51.573
But I might have
more time to devote

37:51.573 --> 37:53.314
to running our quarry
to ground

37:53.314 --> 37:55.403
if I didn't have to
keep covering things up

37:55.403 --> 37:56.622
for their executioner.

37:56.622 --> 37:58.580
Wha--you didn't seem

37:58.580 --> 37:59.842
to have any complaints
when he

37:59.842 --> 38:01.975
eliminated your rival
years ago.

38:01.975 --> 38:03.106
Ha.

38:13.943 --> 38:17.251
Have you forgotten
your debt of gratitude?

38:19.340 --> 38:20.559
I haven't.

38:22.125 --> 38:23.344
Just keep me in office
so I can

38:23.344 --> 38:24.650
continue to repay it.

38:50.937 --> 38:51.981
I'm sorry.

38:53.461 --> 38:55.289
I never meant for you to
get in so much trouble.

38:55.289 --> 38:56.508
It's OK.

38:56.508 --> 38:58.336
No, it's not.

38:58.336 --> 39:00.642
Helping me is
just too risky.

39:00.642 --> 39:02.644
Says the guy who
Catwomaned his way
into Wayne Tower

39:02.644 --> 39:04.385
and almost came out
way shorter.

39:08.476 --> 39:11.349
At least now we know
the Court of Owls is real

39:11.349 --> 39:13.655
and we can use this
to clear our names.

39:13.655 --> 39:14.830
I just don't get
how the Talon

39:14.830 --> 39:16.136
even knew
you were there.

39:17.572 --> 39:19.705
I mean, you guys have to
heist your way in there

39:19.705 --> 39:23.273
dodging security guards,
cameras, motion sensors,

39:23.273 --> 39:25.058
and the Talon just

39:25.058 --> 39:27.843
cruises in and out of
there without a trace?

39:27.843 --> 39:29.802
Yeah, and that's not
the only mystery.

39:31.107 --> 39:32.152
Look at this.

39:33.588 --> 39:35.329
This is the last one
my dad wrote in.

39:35.329 --> 39:36.678
Anything interesting?

39:36.678 --> 39:40.160
Well, somebody
thought so, because...

39:40.160 --> 39:42.205
they ripped out
his final entry.

39:42.205 --> 39:43.250
I don't get it.

39:44.599 --> 39:47.210
Why didn't they just
take the whole journal?

39:47.210 --> 39:50.300
I don't know,
but whoever it was

39:50.300 --> 39:51.650
doesn't want us
to know what he wrote.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.075
Greg, move your head.
