00:22.360 --> 00:25.008
- You guys smell that?
- I said, "Excuse me."

00:25.073 --> 00:26.407
- No, you didn't.
- Not that.

00:26.472 --> 00:28.447
Something different.
It's a familiar smell

00:28.512 --> 00:30.233
but also somehow exotic.

00:30.298 --> 00:32.587
Like going to a mall
in a different town.

00:32.652 --> 00:34.499
Oh, you're probably
smelling my smelly mom.

00:34.564 --> 00:37.009
- Hey!
- She's been wearing "essential oils."

00:37.074 --> 00:39.038
Oh, yeah, the rosemary oil.

00:39.103 --> 00:41.092
She bought them from
her new friend, Angie.

00:41.157 --> 00:44.429
- Her hot new friend, Angie.
- What? Mom's way hotter.

00:44.673 --> 00:46.764
Hotter than
Angie? Are you nuts?

00:46.829 --> 00:48.444
I mean, thank you,
but you're nuts.

00:48.509 --> 00:51.404
Mm, new friend. That's nice.
How'd you guys meet?

00:51.469 --> 00:53.821
At the grocery store
in the toilet paper aisle.

00:53.886 --> 00:55.665
We bonded
'cause we buy the same brand.

00:55.730 --> 00:57.413
And then what,
she said, uh,

00:57.478 --> 00:59.756
"You know what goes good
with toilet paper? Oils."

00:59.821 --> 01:02.146
Kinda, yeah. It's, like,
a hobby or something.

01:02.211 --> 01:04.279
She's bringing some more over
for me to try today.

01:04.343 --> 01:06.138
I can't wait.
They're cheap and I love 'em.

01:06.203 --> 01:07.583
- Like Dad.
- Gene.

01:07.648 --> 01:09.084
She's young
and she's fun,

01:09.149 --> 01:11.951
and I like saying, "Hey, Ange!"
when I see her.

01:12.016 --> 01:14.898
Oh, there she is!
Hey, Ange!

01:14.988 --> 01:17.105
- That is fun.
- Eh. - Fun enough.

01:17.170 --> 01:18.560
- No.
- Hey, Linda.

01:18.625 --> 01:21.521
- Linda smells great. I'm Teddy.
- Easy, Teddy, easy.

01:21.586 --> 01:24.115
Ange, that rosemary oil
is amazing!

01:24.180 --> 01:26.803
My digestion is better,
and I'm crazy relaxed.

01:26.868 --> 01:28.021
Right, kids?
Right?

01:28.086 --> 01:30.363
Yeah. She just
poops and sleeps, Angie.

01:30.428 --> 01:32.045
Oh, I knew
you'd like it.

01:32.110 --> 01:33.420
Here's that geranium oil

01:33.485 --> 01:35.240
- I was telling you about.
- Ooh. Yeah.

01:35.305 --> 01:37.357
It's calming and relaxing
like the rosemary,

01:37.422 --> 01:39.732
but this one also gives
you healthier hair and skin.

01:39.797 --> 01:41.310
Not that
you need to worry about that.

01:41.375 --> 01:43.554
- Oh, you. Stop it.
- I want to buy some.

01:43.619 --> 01:45.896
- What else do you have in there?
- Well, this is clary sage,

01:45.961 --> 01:47.088
which is good for ovulation.

01:47.153 --> 01:49.971
- I'll take it!
- Oh. It's for ovulation.

01:50.036 --> 01:51.537
Don't talk yourself
out of a sale.

01:51.602 --> 01:54.826
Okay. Hey, I'm having an
essential oil party tonight.

01:54.891 --> 01:56.396
Either of you
want to swing by?

01:56.461 --> 01:59.053
An oil party?
What's that? What is that?

01:59.118 --> 02:01.568
Oh, it's really low-key.
We have hors d'oeuvres and wine

02:01.633 --> 02:03.998
- and people checking out different oils.
- Sounds great.

02:04.063 --> 02:06.506
Oh! You had me at hors d'oeuvres,
wine and oils.

02:06.571 --> 02:08.544
Well, Teddy and I were
supposed to help Mr. Huggins

02:08.610 --> 02:10.233
- move a bed tonight.
- Oh, right,

02:10.298 --> 02:11.905
I was gonna stay home
with the kids.

02:11.970 --> 02:13.599
- Crap! That's tonight?
- Yeah.

02:13.664 --> 02:15.483
But it shouldn't take any time.
I hope.

02:15.548 --> 02:17.375
Because
that's why I agreed to do it.

02:17.440 --> 02:19.990
Well, it's from 6:00 to
8:00. Come if you can.

02:20.055 --> 02:22.896
- Here's my address.
- Oh, that's early. I can go.

02:22.961 --> 02:25.708
3456th Street.
Oh, what a fun address.

02:25.773 --> 02:26.833
It really is.

02:26.898 --> 02:28.859
Okay. See you later.
Bye, guys.

02:28.930 --> 02:31.029
- Bye, Ange!
- Bye, Ange! We'll see ya later!

02:31.094 --> 02:32.248
Take it easy.

02:32.313 --> 02:34.021
She's amazing.
Did I play it cool?

02:34.086 --> 02:36.365
No. I could hear you
breathing the whole time.

02:36.430 --> 02:37.701
- Yeah...
- Like, heavily breathing.

02:37.766 --> 02:39.739
So, looks like a
fun night with the sibs.

02:39.804 --> 02:41.451
No parents, no rules!

02:41.516 --> 02:44.783
Yes rules. Tina's gonna babysit.
Right, Tina?

02:44.848 --> 02:46.708
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

02:47.470 --> 02:48.617
Okay.

02:48.993 --> 02:50.146
<i>Hey, guys,</i>

02:50.222 --> 02:51.826
with Mom and Dad
out of the house

02:51.891 --> 02:53.648
I have a surprise
for tonight.

02:53.774 --> 02:56.693
- You're... going to bed early?
- Is it a meringue?

02:56.758 --> 02:59.168
It's the jigsaw puzzle
Grandma gave us for Christmas.

02:59.237 --> 03:01.717
Ugh.
A jigsaw puzzle of the Big Dipper?

03:01.782 --> 03:03.592
- It's impossible!
- She gave that to us,

03:03.657 --> 03:05.246
like, three Christmases ago.

03:05.548 --> 03:07.849
If it didn't happen then,
it's not gonna happen now.

03:07.914 --> 03:10.023
Well, I'll just get it
started, and maybe you guys

03:10.101 --> 03:11.381
will be jumping in 
before you know it.

03:11.483 --> 03:13.718
Aha! These two pieces were
already stuck together.

03:13.802 --> 03:16.168
Off to a pretty
good start here.

03:17.778 --> 03:20.435
Hey, neighbor! Thanks
for helping me do this.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.593
Uh, h-happy to help, Mr. Huggins.

03:22.658 --> 03:23.844
- Hi, Bob.
- Hey, Teddy.

03:23.909 --> 03:25.556
The place we're picking up
the bed

03:25.674 --> 03:27.211
is a little further away
than I thought.

03:27.276 --> 03:28.937
- I hope that's okay.
- No problem.

03:29.002 --> 03:31.546
- It's... fine.
- Sorry I won't be much help.

03:31.611 --> 03:34.246
Uh, can't lift anything
since my back went out.

03:34.332 --> 03:36.372
- Well, uh, I guess that works for us.
- Especially

03:36.437 --> 03:37.786
because
it's an adjustable bed.

03:37.851 --> 03:39.349
Those things are heavy.

03:39.414 --> 03:41.341
- Yeah.
- My old one weighed a ton.

03:41.406 --> 03:44.021
It looked like a dentist chair
crossed with a Transformer.

03:44.086 --> 03:45.896
Oh. Do you need us to
haul the old one away?

03:45.961 --> 03:47.341
- Mm. Mm.
- Bob, why are you hitting me?

03:47.406 --> 03:48.552
- Don't. Will you stop?
- Mmmm. Mm-mm.

03:48.617 --> 03:49.933
- Your foot is getting away from you.
- Mm. Yep.

03:49.998 --> 03:52.419
No, I donated it.
The charity people came and got it.

03:52.484 --> 03:54.967
- Really cussed me out.
- I hate those guys.

03:55.656 --> 03:57.630
Linda!
Come on in!

03:57.695 --> 03:59.161
So glad
you made it.

03:59.226 --> 04:01.661
Oh, I'm so excited,
I'm gonna oil myself.

04:01.726 --> 04:03.606
- Heh. Get it?
- Sort of.

04:03.671 --> 04:06.467
This is Gary,
Jill, Susan and Kim.

04:06.538 --> 04:08.794
Some oil sellers.
All oil users.

04:08.859 --> 04:10.603
Hi! I'm Linda!

04:10.668 --> 04:11.864
- Hi.
- Welcome. -Hi.

04:11.929 --> 04:13.153
And that's Reggie.

04:13.218 --> 04:15.179
Reggie?
Are you taking a break

04:15.244 --> 04:16.785
from the deli
to learn about oils?

04:16.850 --> 04:19.350
Yep. No more stinkin'
like salami for me.

04:19.428 --> 04:21.788
Eh, I'm still getting a whiff.
But it's good.

04:21.853 --> 04:25.498
Also, I haven't been sick once
since I started using essential oils.

04:25.563 --> 04:28.013
- Wow!
- And my toilet time?

04:28.078 --> 04:29.888
Let's just say
it's uneventful.

04:29.953 --> 04:31.028
And I'm so healthy,

04:31.093 --> 04:33.575
I don't even have to
wash my hands. Ever.

04:33.640 --> 04:35.101
O... Kay.

04:35.179 --> 04:37.709
Look at all those oils,
Angie!

04:37.783 --> 04:39.626
I thought you were just
selling them part-time,

04:39.704 --> 04:41.960
but you've got more oil
than a Beverly Hillbilly.

04:42.025 --> 04:43.738
Oh, no.
This is my full-time job.

04:43.803 --> 04:46.068
- Oh.
- But honestly, they sell themselves.

04:46.133 --> 04:47.631
And maybe
you can sell them, too.

04:47.696 --> 04:48.781
Oh!

04:49.803 --> 04:51.388
I found another
corner-piece.

04:51.453 --> 04:52.896
Wait, five corner-pieces?

04:52.961 --> 04:54.341
You're fighting
the good fight, T.

04:54.406 --> 04:55.880
You're that
puzzle's Renée Zellweger

04:55.945 --> 04:58.186
from Jerry Maguire...
You complete it.

04:59.625 --> 05:00.872
Hello. I'm a kid,

05:00.937 --> 05:02.982
but all my grown-ups
are totally home.

05:03.047 --> 05:04.724
Hi, Louise.
It's your Aunt Gayle.

05:04.789 --> 05:07.642
Can I talk to your mom?
I lost the lottery again.

05:07.707 --> 05:09.774
Yeah, I lied.
Mom and Dad are both out.

05:09.839 --> 05:11.872
They just like me
to answer that way.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.574
- Sounds natural.
- Oh, that's nice.

05:13.639 --> 05:15.154
Did they go to the movies?

05:15.219 --> 05:18.546
Or go share one
milkshake with two straws?

05:18.611 --> 05:19.692
Is that what people do?

05:19.757 --> 05:22.124
Tina!
Aunt Gayle wants to talk to you!

05:22.189 --> 05:24.521
- Hey, Aunt G. What's up?
- I was calling for your mom,

05:24.586 --> 05:27.450
but I guess she's out with
your dad doing married stuff.

05:27.515 --> 05:29.068
Actually, Dad's helping move a bed,

05:29.133 --> 05:32.122
- and Mom's at an essential oil party.
- What?!

05:32.187 --> 05:35.597
- Your mom's at an essential oil party?!
- Yes.

05:38.297 --> 05:40.255
Oh! We got to get
your mom out of here!

05:40.320 --> 05:42.982
- She needs an oil-vention!
- Aunt Gayle, you're scaring me.

05:43.047 --> 05:45.997
Yeah. You know I love being
screamed at and thrown in a car,

05:46.062 --> 05:47.591
but what is going on?

05:47.656 --> 05:49.382
Essential oil parties
are dangerous.

05:49.460 --> 05:51.797
I bought the distributor's
package at one of those parties,

05:51.875 --> 05:54.240
$600 worth,
and I couldn't sell any of it,

05:54.305 --> 05:55.982
and I used half of it
on myself!

05:56.047 --> 05:57.356
- Oh, my God!
- Bicyclist!

05:57.421 --> 05:59.075
It's on my credit card,
Tina.

05:59.140 --> 06:01.200
- I'll be paying it off till I'm dead!
- Aah!

06:01.265 --> 06:03.444
We can't let your mom
end up like me!

06:03.529 --> 06:04.622
Aah! You're right!

06:04.687 --> 06:07.061
We can't get any poorer,
can we?

06:07.126 --> 06:09.575
I guess she could sell all of
our belongings and our clothes,

06:09.640 --> 06:11.217
make us wear burlap sacks.

06:11.303 --> 06:13.403
Aah! Burlap sacks are
the itchiest sacks.

06:13.468 --> 06:15.498
- We'll get her out of there.
- Hot dog stand!

06:15.563 --> 06:17.998
- Where?
- I'm just saying we should stop at one!

06:20.447 --> 06:22.739
Okay, let's go over
the plan one more time.

06:22.804 --> 06:24.845
We go into the party,
you take Mom aside,

06:24.910 --> 06:26.700
tell her the very sad
story about what happened

06:26.765 --> 06:28.880
- with you and the oils, and we get out.
- Mmhmm.

06:28.945 --> 06:31.161
Bing bang boom.
Angie will not know what hit her.

06:31.226 --> 06:33.234
We have to get your mom home
before they bring out

06:33.299 --> 06:35.504
the big guns...
The credit card swipers.

06:35.569 --> 06:38.732
- Can do!
- And stay by my side at all times.

06:38.797 --> 06:41.498
I can't be trusted with the pe...
the pe...

06:41.593 --> 06:43.020
the peppermint oil.

06:43.085 --> 06:45.877
Oh, God, just saying the
name gives me the shivers.

06:45.954 --> 06:48.099
- Peppermint oil.
- Ah, oh, ho, ho...!

06:48.307 --> 06:51.256
And that's when I got my
"aroma diploma."

06:51.321 --> 06:54.489
Oh, I'm not sure why
you're all laughing.

06:54.554 --> 06:56.825
Ugh. It smells like someone ate,
prayed and loved

06:56.890 --> 06:58.419
- too much in here.
- Oh, no.

06:58.484 --> 07:00.325
- It's worse than I thought.
- Why?

07:00.390 --> 07:02.067
- She's pretty.
- T <i>hank you.</i>

07:02.132 --> 07:04.481
No, the host.
Pretty friends

07:04.546 --> 07:06.484
are your mom's a-chillies heel.

07:06.577 --> 07:08.817
- Do you mean "Achilles"?
- No, "a-chillies,"

07:08.882 --> 07:10.043
like the heel.

07:10.108 --> 07:12.614
She falls under the spell
of these pretty people,

07:12.679 --> 07:14.904
and she doesn't even
realize they're using her.

07:14.969 --> 07:17.944
Like her cheerleader friend
Monica in high school.

07:18.009 --> 07:20.075
- Mom's a pretty pleaser.
- Kids!

07:20.140 --> 07:21.911
Gayle!
What are you doing here?

07:21.976 --> 07:24.160
Mom, Aunt Gayle has
something to tell you.

07:24.225 --> 07:25.668
We got to
get you out of here.

07:25.733 --> 07:27.206
Stop it, Gayle.
You're acting weird.

07:27.271 --> 07:29.653
I'll make a distraction.
You sneak out.

07:29.718 --> 07:31.110
Pizza delivery!

07:31.175 --> 07:32.708
Gayle,
either zip it or leave.

07:32.773 --> 07:34.176
- But, Linda...
- Oh, hi.

07:34.241 --> 07:35.950
Sorry, Angie. I didn't know

07:36.015 --> 07:37.634
these guys were gonna show up.
I...

07:37.699 --> 07:39.592
Oh, it's no problem. Kids,

07:39.657 --> 07:42.325
Gary brought his son Ronnie, and
he's in the next room playing.

07:42.390 --> 07:43.793
Maybe
you could join him in there,

07:43.858 --> 07:45.793
make it the kids' room.
Fun!

07:45.858 --> 07:47.895
- Linda.
- Yeah, uh, yeah, kids,

07:47.960 --> 07:50.024
go play in the kids' room.
Stop it, Gayle.

07:50.089 --> 07:52.110
Gayle, finish the job.

07:53.553 --> 07:55.395
Do you guys like
doing puzzles?

07:55.460 --> 07:57.157
- Yes.
- No! - No!

07:59.330 --> 08:00.959
I think this is it.

08:01.030 --> 08:02.215
That's not too bad.

08:02.280 --> 08:03.801
Nah. Keep going.

08:03.866 --> 08:05.316
I think... this is it.

08:05.405 --> 08:07.694
Oh... my God.

08:07.759 --> 08:10.373
This
is just... so awkward.

08:10.460 --> 08:12.160
Have you never moved
a mattress before?

08:12.279 --> 08:13.465
I-I don't remember.

08:13.530 --> 08:15.262
I think everywhere
I lived

08:15.327 --> 08:17.059
they were just there already.

08:17.124 --> 08:19.553
Don't worry,
the frame will be a lot easier.

08:19.632 --> 08:21.647
It weighs about eight times
as much as the mattress,

08:21.725 --> 08:23.751
- but it's not as bendy.
- Oh, God.

08:23.835 --> 08:25.895
I think
I've asked too much of people

08:25.960 --> 08:27.185
I don't know all
that well.

08:27.296 --> 08:29.304
- Well, maybe.
- No, it's fine.

08:29.369 --> 08:31.354
So let's fix that.
What's your favorite movie?

08:31.419 --> 08:33.390
- Or your favorite childhood memory?
- What?

08:33.456 --> 08:35.129
Let's, uh, let's get to
know each other better.

08:35.193 --> 08:38.171
Uh, maybe let's, uh,
wait until we finish.

08:38.236 --> 08:39.551
For me,
it's Dark Crystal

08:39.616 --> 08:42.575
- and the time my dad high-fived me.
- Well, that's nice.

08:42.640 --> 08:45.503
And oils don't just
make you smell great,

08:45.568 --> 08:47.404
they make you
feel great.

08:47.539 --> 08:50.044
- Oh, I love oils!
- Speaking of oils...

08:50.819 --> 08:52.112
Oh, look!

08:52.275 --> 08:54.699
Uh-oh.
Someone's up from his nap.

08:54.764 --> 08:57.035
No, no, Ringo. No.
Ringo, no jumping. Ringo.

08:57.100 --> 08:58.795
- Oh, it's okay.
- It's a puppy. - So adorable.

08:58.873 --> 09:00.215
Oh, I love his name.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.801
I called him Ringo,
because he had ringworm.

09:02.866 --> 09:04.168
Oh. Get down.
Get down.

09:04.233 --> 09:06.474
And because
he pways the dwums.

09:06.539 --> 09:08.621
Ah-ha-ha-ha!
Drums!

09:08.686 --> 09:10.677
Like Ringo McCartney.

09:10.759 --> 09:12.418
This English
cottage is coming together.

09:12.483 --> 09:13.840
You bet your ass.

09:13.905 --> 09:15.012
This is taking too long.

09:15.077 --> 09:17.015
What's Aunt Gayle
doing out there?!

09:17.080 --> 09:19.082
She must have started
a silent conga line,

09:19.147 --> 09:21.030
since I don't hear
any conga line music.

09:21.095 --> 09:23.621
You know what? I'm gonna go out
there and just tell Mom myself.

09:23.686 --> 09:26.245
- Aunt Gayle had her chance...
- Hey, guys. Sorry to interrupt,

09:26.310 --> 09:28.411
but do you mind
if we put Ringo in here?

09:28.507 --> 09:30.363
- Oh, my God, what's happening?
- Ringo!

09:30.428 --> 09:31.754
Don't! Stop! Him!

09:31.819 --> 09:33.794
Are you saying, "Don't stop him"?

09:33.859 --> 09:35.607
Or "Don't. Stop him"?

09:35.717 --> 09:38.162
I'm saying get away!
Get away from us!

09:38.227 --> 09:40.441
I mean, we're fine with him
in here.

09:40.506 --> 09:43.267
Okay, good.
I'll leave you guys to play.

09:43.514 --> 09:47.246
Who's the best boy in the world?
Who's the softest boy?

09:47.311 --> 09:49.325
My ears are burning.

09:49.407 --> 09:51.474
Are you sure
you're even lifting, Bob?

09:51.539 --> 09:53.155
Yes. I am trying.

09:53.220 --> 09:54.535
It's really heavy,

09:54.600 --> 09:56.567
and I am so weak.

09:58.491 --> 10:00.114
What about
your favorite foods?

10:00.179 --> 10:03.511
I'll start this one. Thai food.
No. Mexican.

10:03.576 --> 10:05.510
Wait. Thai. You know what?

10:05.600 --> 10:07.765
I think it's a tie.
A Mexican-Thai tie.

10:07.830 --> 10:10.918
- Hey, I need another break.
- No. I have to hold this thing

10:10.983 --> 10:12.189
every time
we take a break.

10:12.254 --> 10:13.624
It's not a break for me,
Bob.

10:13.689 --> 10:15.933
I'm just gonna push.
Whatever happens, happens.

10:15.998 --> 10:17.327
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

10:17.392 --> 10:19.536
I already started!
I can't stop now!

10:19.601 --> 10:21.911
I'm pinned against
the door! Pull it back!

10:21.976 --> 10:23.642
I can't. It's stuck.

10:24.218 --> 10:26.115
I'm gonna try to open the door.

10:26.366 --> 10:27.550
Aah! It's locked!

10:27.667 --> 10:29.130
Oh, you know what?
I probably should've gone

10:29.195 --> 10:31.576
ahead of you guys, because
I have a key. Here you go!

10:31.882 --> 10:33.630
- Ow!
- Oh, did I get you?

10:33.695 --> 10:35.738
J-Just my head
and my face.

10:35.898 --> 10:38.333
You need to get out of here,
Linda.

10:38.398 --> 10:39.956
Gayle, I said knock it off!

10:40.021 --> 10:41.758
How are things
goin' over here?

10:41.823 --> 10:43.007
So far, so great!

10:43.072 --> 10:44.599
But, um...
we're gonna leave.

10:44.664 --> 10:46.544
- What? No!
- Yeah, we should.

10:46.609 --> 10:48.583
The kids are probably
bored stiff in there.

10:48.648 --> 10:49.679
Right?

10:49.757 --> 10:51.535
Now you're Smush face,
now you're smooth face.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.755
Now you're Smush face,
now you're smooth face.

10:53.820 --> 10:55.122
- Now you're Smush face...
- I feel like there's something else

10:55.187 --> 10:56.762
- we're supposed to be doing right now.
- Now you're smooth face.

10:56.827 --> 10:58.928
Well, I'm up to my butt
in puzzle, so...

10:59.094 --> 11:02.606
Almost done here. Just gonna
do this one hundred more times.

11:02.671 --> 11:05.738
Yeah, I should probably make
his back skin into a purse again.

11:05.849 --> 11:06.740
Yeah.

11:06.818 --> 11:07.834
And...

11:07.912 --> 11:09.185
we're finally done.

11:09.499 --> 11:11.098
Wow,
this thing's amazing.

11:11.163 --> 11:12.730
I'm so grateful to you
fellas.

11:12.795 --> 11:15.132
I don't have any beer,
but you want a tomato juice?

11:15.197 --> 11:16.782
Oh, no thanks,
Mr. Huggins.

11:16.847 --> 11:18.943
- Uh, I'm-I'm gonna get going.
- It's just,

11:19.053 --> 11:21.974
n-now that I got this bed in here,
I'm kind of freakin' out!

11:22.039 --> 11:25.610
The reason I got this new bed
is I'm starting to date again...

11:25.696 --> 11:27.379
Wow. You don't have to brag.

11:27.444 --> 11:28.520
Eh.

11:28.612 --> 11:29.868
No, it's not that.

11:29.933 --> 11:31.543
It's just I'm a little scared.

11:31.608 --> 11:33.388
I haven't been with
anyone for 20 years.

11:33.468 --> 11:34.918
- Oh.
- Now my new lady friend

11:34.983 --> 11:36.746
is coming over tonight,
I'm afraid I've been

11:36.811 --> 11:37.914
out of the game too long.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.340
- Can I ask you two some questions?
- Mm-hmm. Oh, God.

11:40.405 --> 11:42.025
You came to the right guys,
Mr. Huggins.

11:42.090 --> 11:45.208
First of all,
are silk bathrobes still sexy?

11:45.294 --> 11:48.465
- I'm thinking yes, but let's see it.
- Oh, boy.

11:48.530 --> 11:50.133
Linda, here's the thing.

11:50.198 --> 11:52.691
You're in so much terrible danger.

11:52.756 --> 11:54.434
Gayle, stop whispering
in my ear!

11:54.499 --> 11:56.563
- Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!
- Mm, mm...

11:56.628 --> 11:59.258
I'm gonna let go of your lips,
and then you can calmly say

11:59.323 --> 12:01.090
- what it is you want to say.
- Mm.

12:01.155 --> 12:03.677
Oils will ruin your life.

12:03.791 --> 12:06.308
Who here is familiar
with the peppermint oil?

12:06.373 --> 12:07.566
Smell that.

12:07.631 --> 12:10.138
Nng, nng, nng, nng,
nng, nng, nng, nng. Ah.

12:10.273 --> 12:12.935
And we're finished... except
for the several missing pieces.

12:13.022 --> 12:14.464
I mean, how hard is it

12:14.529 --> 12:16.846
to keep all your puzzle
pieces in the box, right?

12:16.911 --> 12:19.737
You're my baby, I'm your mommy.
You're my baby, I'm your mommy.

12:19.802 --> 12:22.218
Oh, crap. Mom!
We forgot about Mom!

12:22.283 --> 12:24.276
Damn it, Tina and your
stupid English cottage!

12:24.341 --> 12:26.356
- Easy there, puppy-hag.
- Puzzle-putz.

12:26.421 --> 12:29.215
Ladies, please!
You both really messed up tonight.

12:29.302 --> 12:31.292
This thing is great.
I just plug it into my phone,

12:31.357 --> 12:32.948
and you can pay
with your credit card!

12:33.013 --> 12:34.381
- Oh crap!
- The swiper!

12:34.446 --> 12:38.293
God, e-commerce has come so
far. What? You were thinking it.

12:40.197 --> 12:43.747
- Oh, yes!
- We waited too long.

12:43.812 --> 12:46.667
Yeah. Aunt Gayle
is no good to us now.

12:46.732 --> 12:48.479
It's up to us
to get Mom out of here.

12:48.544 --> 12:51.112
There's no time to lose.
She's gonna swipe any second.

12:51.177 --> 12:53.557
- Front to back, I hope.
- Oh, hey, kids.

12:53.622 --> 12:54.846
What are you doing out
here?

12:54.911 --> 12:56.552
Oh. Hey.

12:56.702 --> 12:59.231
Uh, poor Ringo threw
up all over the place.

12:59.364 --> 13:00.782
Uh, right, guys?

13:00.847 --> 13:03.612
- Ah, yeah, so much.
- It's ugly.

13:03.677 --> 13:05.598
Oh, no. Sorry.

13:05.712 --> 13:08.668
We're trying a new puppy food.
It's made from wasps.

13:08.744 --> 13:11.129
Are you just saying that
so I won't want to try it?

13:11.302 --> 13:12.713
- Ah!
- Mom, we got to get out of here.

13:12.778 --> 13:14.184
Why does everyone
keep saying that?

13:14.290 --> 13:16.042
You're falling
under Angie's spell,

13:16.107 --> 13:18.209
like you fell under Monica's
spell in high school!

13:18.274 --> 13:20.424
What? No,
this is nothing like Monica.

13:20.489 --> 13:22.385
Monica used to make
me hold her cigarette

13:22.450 --> 13:23.932
whenever a teacher would walk by.

13:23.997 --> 13:26.262
Angie's nice.
She likes nice smells.

13:26.402 --> 13:28.917
Has she asked you to
start selling the oil?

13:28.982 --> 13:31.547
Well, yeah,
because she thinks I can.

13:31.612 --> 13:35.135
- I didn't see any throw-up in there.
- Maybe Ronnie cleaned it up?

13:35.200 --> 13:37.675
- Or Ringo ate it?
- Or Ronnie ate it.

13:37.740 --> 13:41.327
In any case, we, uh...
all have to get going.

13:41.392 --> 13:42.874
No! We're not going yet.

13:42.939 --> 13:45.276
You guys go back to the kids'
room until we're done in here.

13:45.341 --> 13:46.287
- But...
- No buts!

13:46.352 --> 13:47.670
- But, uh...
- I'll tell you what.

13:47.735 --> 13:50.179
Go back in, and I'll put this
diffuser in there with you.

13:50.244 --> 13:53.449
- Kids love diffusers. Right?
- It's all we ever talk about.

13:53.696 --> 13:55.726
Va-Va-Va-Va, Va-Va-Va-Va.

13:56.013 --> 13:57.450
Ugh!

13:57.528 --> 13:58.622
So what do you think?

13:58.705 --> 13:59.911
Anything look weird
to you guys?

13:59.976 --> 14:01.641
- Like, weird how?
- Mm.

14:01.706 --> 14:03.946
You know what I mean.
Do I look... okay?

14:04.011 --> 14:05.638
Yeah, you look... you look great.

14:05.703 --> 14:07.626
Uh, so... should we go?

14:07.691 --> 14:10.440
Uh, turn around, Mr. Huggins.
Let's get a look at the back.

14:10.589 --> 14:11.589
Wow.

14:11.667 --> 14:12.944
What? What? My tattoo?

14:13.009 --> 14:14.745
There's a tattoo under there?

14:14.899 --> 14:16.704
Throw us back
in here with the adorable

14:16.769 --> 14:17.978
Ringo to distract me?

14:18.043 --> 14:19.382
It's not gonna work, Angie!

14:19.447 --> 14:21.620
Not now, my sweet boy.

14:21.962 --> 14:24.765
On a positive note,
over here in puzzle-town,

14:24.961 --> 14:26.537
I have drawn replacement pieces

14:26.602 --> 14:28.062
with these markers and sticky notes,

14:28.127 --> 14:31.430
and we're about
to move into an English cottage.

14:31.495 --> 14:34.531
Ronnie, you son of a bitch,
if I was just five years younger.

14:34.596 --> 14:36.517
Oh...
I don't get it.

14:36.582 --> 14:38.019
Wait. Markers.

14:38.084 --> 14:39.971
Yeah.
They're like pens, but...

14:40.036 --> 14:42.790
Well, just try one and see.

14:43.870 --> 14:45.352
My side's going
pretty well.

14:45.417 --> 14:46.508
How are you doing over there,
Bobby?

14:46.573 --> 14:49.411
I'm getting a lot of hair in
my mouth right now, so, uh...

14:49.476 --> 14:50.687
Ha. Ha, ha, ha.

14:50.752 --> 14:51.839
Let-let...
let's wrap it up. Ugh.

14:51.904 --> 14:53.353
Just swallow it.
It won't hurt you.

14:53.444 --> 14:55.366
Hey, what are you guys
talking about back there?

14:55.444 --> 14:57.822
Nothing. Oh, there's
the tattoo. Found it.

14:57.900 --> 14:59.613
- What is that?
- It's a yin-yang.

14:59.678 --> 15:01.328
Who told you
this was a yin-yang?

15:01.393 --> 15:03.303
The guy at the place!
Is it that bad?

15:03.453 --> 15:06.063
Uh, I'll just shave some
and leave some.

15:06.128 --> 15:07.609
Then, it kind of works.

15:07.674 --> 15:08.994
Oh, wait.
No, it doesn't.

15:09.059 --> 15:11.697
Eh, it doesn't. Uh, do
you have any high boxers?

15:11.962 --> 15:13.360
Uh, sorry to interrupt again.

15:13.425 --> 15:15.720
- Louise doesn't look so good.
- I feel okay.

15:15.787 --> 15:19.016
I'm just a little wheezy
and a little itchy.

15:19.081 --> 15:20.951
Maybe too much oil
in the air?

15:21.042 --> 15:22.766
I'm so sorry.

15:22.831 --> 15:25.516
I've heard an allergic
reaction is possible,

15:25.581 --> 15:27.234
but I've never seen it.

15:27.299 --> 15:28.939
Guess I'm lucky, Angie.

15:29.008 --> 15:31.078
Hmm. Come here.
Give me that.

15:31.752 --> 15:33.444
- Uh-oh.
- Is that marker?

15:33.509 --> 15:34.867
- You kids are in big trouble!
- Come on!

15:34.932 --> 15:36.570
- We're trying to help you!
- Mom, you got to listen to us!

15:36.635 --> 15:38.227
No! No, no, no!
Don't start.

15:38.292 --> 15:40.796
I'm gonna finish talking about
the deluxe distributor package

15:40.861 --> 15:42.908
with Angie, and you're gonna
leave with your Aunt Gayle.

15:42.986 --> 15:44.564
Deluxe distributor package?
No!

15:44.643 --> 15:47.822
Gayle, take the kids home, and
give those vials back to Reggie.

15:47.908 --> 15:50.266
- Ah...
- Keep 'em.

15:53.017 --> 15:55.954
Mom, we don't want what happened
to Aunt Gayle to happen to you.

15:56.019 --> 15:58.188
- What are you talking about?
- Gayle? Ugh.

15:58.253 --> 15:59.619
Gayle!

15:59.711 --> 16:01.024
- Huh?
- Tell her!

16:01.089 --> 16:03.906
Oh. Right. Linda, I tried selling oil.

16:03.971 --> 16:06.106
I tried it. I got in over my head!

16:06.171 --> 16:07.578
I bought the distributor package.

16:07.643 --> 16:08.969
I couldn't sell any of it.

16:09.034 --> 16:11.494
It's on my credit card
for the rest of my life!

16:11.628 --> 16:13.952
Gayle, none of that surprises me,
okay?

16:14.017 --> 16:15.492
But that's not gonna happen
to me.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.486
All of you, go home...
now.

16:18.601 --> 16:20.649
- Let us love you!
- Aah! Aah!

16:20.714 --> 16:22.531
If you come back in
here, you're grounded.

16:22.596 --> 16:24.633
You too, Gayle.
Good-bye.

16:24.698 --> 16:26.555
- What do we do now?
- I don't know.

16:26.620 --> 16:29.445
Take a bat to the window?
Tina, pass me your bat.

16:29.510 --> 16:31.845
- I didn't bring a bat.
- Damn it, Tina.

16:31.995 --> 16:34.649
Is... anyone else
having trouble like that?

16:34.714 --> 16:36.234
Um, uh, my sales are...

16:36.299 --> 16:38.055
They're-they're pretty terrific.

16:38.120 --> 16:40.430
I've been selling a lot,
to my family, mostly.

16:40.495 --> 16:41.867
Uh, they're very supportive.

16:41.932 --> 16:45.072
Mine, too, but the best news is
I-I may have found a new lender.

16:45.141 --> 16:48.297
So I can buy more oils to pay
for the ones I used on myself.

16:48.362 --> 16:50.566
I'm looking forward to
selling my first vial.

16:50.631 --> 16:53.461
And sure, a-a friend of
mine stopped talking to me,

16:53.526 --> 16:54.875
'cause of the oils,
but I really thought

16:54.940 --> 16:57.359
he could use some diffusers
to deal with his sinuses.

16:57.424 --> 16:59.861
He-he has bad sinuses.
Eucalyptus, right?

16:59.943 --> 17:02.588
- Right!
- I'm not crazy. He's crazy!

17:02.653 --> 17:03.809
Huh.

17:04.315 --> 17:06.492
Nah, but maybe-maybe
more to the left.

17:06.557 --> 17:07.891
- Okay. Okay.
- There you go. Nailed it.

17:07.955 --> 17:09.266
- Okay, how about that?
- No, that's perfect.

17:09.330 --> 17:10.983
- That's perfect.
- Okay. Okay, so that lamp's on?

17:11.049 --> 17:12.125
- Yup.
- And that lamp off.

17:12.190 --> 17:15.095
All right. Yeah.
Both of 'em not on. Try that.

17:15.201 --> 17:17.050
- That's pretty dark.
- Oh, now it's dark. Right. Yeah.

17:17.127 --> 17:18.534
- This is stupid.
- Okay. okay, yeah.

17:18.612 --> 17:20.711
- Uh... that's better.
- Of course it's better!

17:20.776 --> 17:23.699
What is wrong with you guys?!
When is this gonna end?!

17:23.882 --> 17:25.896
Sorry. That was unnecessary.

17:25.961 --> 17:28.207
It's just been...
a very annoying

17:28.271 --> 17:30.365
and physically
painful evening.

17:30.432 --> 17:32.337
I've taken up enough of your time.

17:32.408 --> 17:35.724
It'll be fine.
It'll go... how it goes.

17:35.879 --> 17:37.727
Uh, Mr. Huggins, listen.

17:37.792 --> 17:40.219
You're-you're a great guy,
I-I think.

17:40.284 --> 17:43.439
I... like you less today,
but I'm pretty sure

17:43.517 --> 17:45.150
- you're a great guy.
- That's fair enough.

17:45.228 --> 17:47.961
So... just be yourself
with your new lady friend.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.295
Tell her everything you
told me and Teddy today...

17:50.360 --> 17:52.505
Your favorite movies,
your favorite foods...

17:52.570 --> 17:55.094
But mostly, tell her that
you're feeling nervous.

17:55.159 --> 17:56.664
She'll appreciate your honesty,

17:56.729 --> 17:58.790
and it might take away the
pressure you're feeling.

17:58.916 --> 18:01.562
Wow. Makes sense.
Thank you, Rob.

18:01.627 --> 18:02.959
- It's Bob.
- What?

18:03.024 --> 18:04.632
Nothing. It's fine.
You're welcome.

18:04.697 --> 18:07.093
- And the robe is sexy.
- Thank you.

18:07.158 --> 18:09.820
Wow. "Be yourself."
Wish I said that.

18:09.885 --> 18:11.304
The guy can barely carry
a mattress,

18:11.369 --> 18:13.115
but then he pulls
through down the stretch

18:13.180 --> 18:14.546
with the poignant life lesson.

18:14.611 --> 18:17.063
Ugh. Bobby, you're good.

18:17.895 --> 18:19.259
Ooh! I know why that happened.

18:19.361 --> 18:21.125
I had all these extra
screws, and I thought,

18:21.197 --> 18:23.613
"Wait, did I bring these,
or are they from the bed?"

18:23.678 --> 18:25.234
Now I know,
they are from the bed.

18:25.299 --> 18:27.585
That's on me. Bob, give me a hand.

18:27.650 --> 18:29.087
Got to go. Bye.

18:29.166 --> 18:31.297
I'm sorry you're all...
struggling.

18:31.416 --> 18:33.350
I... had another...
great month.

18:33.415 --> 18:38.274
I found about, I think, 15 more
people who bought oil and...

18:38.411 --> 18:41.366
seemed excited about
selling it themselves.

18:41.431 --> 18:43.319
- Way to go, Ange.
- Oh, my God.

18:43.384 --> 18:45.461
- What?
- You are like Monica.

18:45.578 --> 18:47.366
Well, a new kind of Monica.

18:47.431 --> 18:48.896
- A nice Monica.
- Who?

18:48.970 --> 18:51.077
Angie, you're young,
and you're beautiful.

18:51.142 --> 18:53.228
- You're glowing.
- She's radiant.

18:53.293 --> 18:55.311
And that's why
you succeed at this.

18:55.376 --> 18:56.953
People are drawn to you.

18:57.033 --> 18:59.757
It's not the oils.
It's you. It's Angie.

18:59.822 --> 19:02.943
You could sell...
ice to people in Iceland.

19:03.008 --> 19:05.918
I did. I... lived in
Iceland after college.

19:05.993 --> 19:09.327
I sold ice to people...
who... wanted... ice.

19:09.392 --> 19:10.727
Of course you did.

19:10.792 --> 19:12.882
You don't even realize
you're kind of using people.

19:12.947 --> 19:14.585
- I am?
- Kind of.

19:14.650 --> 19:16.923
To you, this stuff sells
itself, but when you sell it

19:16.988 --> 19:19.992
to other people to sell, it's...
it's a weight around their neck.

19:20.103 --> 19:22.444
A big oily weight that
no one wants to buy.

19:22.509 --> 19:25.366
Sorry, Ange,
but it's kind of true.

19:25.431 --> 19:27.218
People like us
see people like you,

19:27.283 --> 19:28.803
and it's like,
"What's your secret?"

19:28.868 --> 19:31.249
Yeah. Who-who doesn't want to feel pretty?
Yeah.

19:31.314 --> 19:33.741
But there's no secret.
You're in your thirties,

19:33.806 --> 19:37.093
and you don't have three kids,
and-and... you have this rug.

19:37.158 --> 19:38.866
- Oh, I love this rug.
- It's a great rug.

19:38.931 --> 19:41.765
And I wanted to feel like
how I imagine you feel.

19:41.830 --> 19:44.539
I-I wanted it so bad that
I would have spent real money,

19:44.619 --> 19:46.811
even though my family was
trying to stop me, and...

19:46.876 --> 19:49.257
and now they're outside the window,
listening in the bushes.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.397
We actually can't hear
much, but we get the gist.

19:51.462 --> 19:54.194
Mommy sees you.
You can come back inside.

19:54.259 --> 19:55.608
I don't know what to say.

19:55.673 --> 19:57.953
I guess
I never thought of it that way.

19:58.048 --> 19:59.616
And that's okay, Angie.

19:59.681 --> 20:01.225
You don't have to think of it
that way.

20:01.290 --> 20:04.054
Look at you.
Enjoy it while you got it. I did.

20:04.119 --> 20:06.538
But now I got this,
and it's even better.

20:06.603 --> 20:08.774
Yeah, take a look at what
you could have, honey.

20:08.931 --> 20:11.000
I get your point, Linda,

20:11.144 --> 20:13.785
and you know you don't have to pay up
front for the distributor package.

20:13.850 --> 20:15.280
There's an installment plan,
and...

20:15.345 --> 20:16.983
Ange, it's not gonna happen.

20:17.048 --> 20:18.575
- I'm listening.
- Gayle, no!

20:18.640 --> 20:20.408
Okay, okay.

20:21.127 --> 20:24.395
Thanks for coming to rescue me,
guys, and Gayle, you were right.

20:24.460 --> 20:26.220
She's a Monica in Angie clothing.

20:26.285 --> 20:27.514
I tried to tell you.

20:27.579 --> 20:29.733
You really
embarrassed yourself in there.

20:29.798 --> 20:31.350
Aunt Gayle, you still have
those vials in your nose.

20:31.415 --> 20:32.860
- Tina, shh. Shh, shh, shh.
- Sorry.

20:32.925 --> 20:34.663
Gene, I took Ringo.

20:34.728 --> 20:36.688
Nice. No
one will ever catch on.

20:37.728 --> 20:40.053
- Louise, did you take the dog?
- No.

20:40.118 --> 20:41.178
Quiet, quiet, quiet.

20:41.243 --> 20:43.061
We're taking him back.
Let me see him.

20:43.126 --> 20:45.632
Who's a baby? Ah, we'll
take him back in an hour.
