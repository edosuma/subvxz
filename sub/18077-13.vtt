WEBVTT

00:00.967 --> 00:03.334
Luck is on our side now.

00:04.938 --> 00:07.100
Yeah? You're all under arrest
for armed robbery.

00:07.173 --> 00:10.973
Some small-town sheriff
just arrested B.A. Baracus.

00:11.044 --> 00:14.537
When that computer sends B.A.'s
fingerprints back, they'll know who he is.

00:14.614 --> 00:16.810
I don't know how long it will
take Decker to get there.

00:19.386 --> 00:21.150
Uh, we train dogs.

00:21.221 --> 00:24.088
Can you help me get this big guy
in the back of the truck here?

00:24.157 --> 00:25.591
What the hell's going on here?

00:25.658 --> 00:28.423
If you wanna stay alive, you
better keep your mouth shut.

00:28.928 --> 00:31.192
You are dead meat.

00:35.602 --> 00:38.299
Let's just hope
that they get here fast.

00:40.507 --> 00:42.032
Where did you learn
to drive like that?

00:42.108 --> 00:44.600
Does he look like the kind of guy
who would threaten somebody?

00:44.677 --> 00:45.940
You got something to say?

00:47.781 --> 00:50.216
<i>(male narrator) In 1972,
a crack commando unit...</i>

00:50.283 --> 00:52.115
<i>was sent to prison
by a military court...</i>

00:52.185 --> 00:53.675
<i>for a crime
they didn't commit.</i>

00:53.753 --> 00:54.982
<i>These men promptly escaped...</i>

00:55.055 --> 00:56.750
<i>from a maximum-security
stockade...</i>

00:56.823 --> 00:58.291

<i>Today, still wanted

01:00.193 --> 01:02.127

(man) Phone call for Mr. Smith.
Phone call for the Aquamaniac.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.427
[people chattering]

02:43.897 --> 02:45.456
Aquamaniac here.

02:45.532 --> 02:47.330
Hannibal, Faceman here.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.267
I hope I didn't catch you at a bad
time, but I have to talk to you.

02:50.336 --> 02:51.565
Bad time?

02:51.638 --> 02:53.970
Did you ever try to hold
your breath for four minutes?

02:54.040 --> 02:56.737
Listen, I got some loose ends
to take care of down here...

02:56.809 --> 02:58.903
so I'm going to be tied up
for a couple more days.

02:58.978 --> 03:01.242
But B.A. and Murdock, they're
driving up ahead of me.

03:01.514 --> 03:03.414
I finish shooting here
tomorrow.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.850
Now that gives us time
to go over our latest offer.

03:05.919 --> 03:09.583
Yeah, well, see, I'm with some business
associates. And you know how it goes.

03:09.656 --> 03:12.421
Before they'll talk investments
they want to see the sights.

03:12.492 --> 03:14.893
They want to meet some girls.

03:14.961 --> 03:19.091
I should be able to wrap it up
in a couple of days.

03:21.467 --> 03:22.935
Oh, by the way...

03:23.002 --> 03:25.494
there's a little slippage from
low to second gear on the Vette.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.597
So would you take it easy
when you accelerate?

03:27.674 --> 03:29.039
The only thing wrong
with that Vette

03:29.108 --> 03:32.169
<i>is that vibration that starts
when you get it over 95.</i>

03:32.245 --> 03:35.408
Now, B.A. and Murdock have got
quite a drive up here.

03:35.615 --> 03:37.709
And you figure they're
gonna have a good time?

03:37.784 --> 03:40.219
I don't know. They've been getting
along pretty good lately.

03:40.286 --> 03:43.153
I have faith they'll get
to LA in one piece.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.418
With a little luck.

03:45.358 --> 03:47.383
Luck is with us now.

03:47.460 --> 03:50.953
My rabbit's foot gonna bring us
luck all the way back to LA.

03:51.030 --> 03:53.522
Rabbit had four of them.
Didn't do him much good.

03:53.600 --> 03:54.726
Just think about it.

03:54.801 --> 03:57.532
I mean, look how good everything
has been going up to now.

03:57.604 --> 03:59.333
I mean, we've been driving
two days now.

03:59.405 --> 04:00.930
How many fights we had?

04:01.007 --> 04:04.671
None. I mean here we are,
just hanging out together...

04:04.744 --> 04:06.974
good friends, in this van.

04:07.180 --> 04:10.013
And what about your radiator?
You yourself said:

04:10.083 --> 04:13.075
"I should've have had
that thing fixed in Baja."

04:13.152 --> 04:16.588
That thing hasn't had a leak.
Yeah, you're right.

04:16.656 --> 04:18.454
We have been holding up
pretty good.

04:18.524 --> 04:20.185
Yeah. I tell you.

04:20.260 --> 04:22.627
Luck is on our side now.

04:22.695 --> 04:24.925
With my new rabbit's foot.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.732
[car engine sputtering]

05:07.807 --> 05:10.299
(Logan) Come on, get this thing going!
It won't start!

05:10.376 --> 05:12.572
Look here. You fill it up.
I'm gonna get us some milk.

05:12.645 --> 05:14.443
You get us some milk,
I'll fill her up.

05:14.514 --> 05:15.504
[Murdock laughing]

05:15.815 --> 05:17.010
Right on, brother.

05:17.083 --> 05:19.245
Hello, what's going on?

05:25.124 --> 05:26.922
I can't remember
having such a good time.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.688
Fill her up, please.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.829
You don't want to?
Slide over and drive.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.725
I'm warning you. You don't
wanna take this van.

05:35.802 --> 05:38.294
I mean, you really don't want this van!
I said, you better move!

05:38.371 --> 05:40.931
Well, let me put it this way.
Taking this van is like taking...

05:41.007 --> 05:43.305
downtown Tokyo away from Godzilla.
Shut up and move!

05:44.844 --> 05:46.505
[tires screeching]

05:48.381 --> 05:50.713
Hey, Murdock!
Where you going, fool?

[horn blaring]

06:43.369 --> 06:44.666
[siren wailing]

06:46.372 --> 06:49.342
There were four of them! They had
a van and a four-door Chevy!

07:03.523 --> 07:05.457
Where did you learn
to drive like that?

07:05.525 --> 07:08.222
I saw Cannonball Run
five times.

07:13.466 --> 07:14.934
Hold on, Murdock!

07:19.071 --> 07:21.335
You turn up Junction 18.

07:21.407 --> 07:23.307
And then you take DuPont Road.

07:23.376 --> 07:26.073
Russell farm?
We're going there now?

07:26.145 --> 07:28.842
Hey, we're scoring big.

07:29.081 --> 07:30.947
I wanna keep
that kind of luck.

07:31.117 --> 07:33.245
What about the wife
and kid?

07:34.554 --> 07:36.682
I feel like
having some fun.

07:41.060 --> 07:43.085
We got a car following us.

07:43.529 --> 07:45.190
I'll back him off.

07:45.298 --> 07:46.891
[gun firing]

08:17.063 --> 08:19.088
You lose him
or you're dead.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.127
Well, you got it.

08:22.001 --> 08:24.436
[tires squealing]

08:32.945 --> 08:35.846
Freeze! One move
and I'll blow you apart.

08:35.982 --> 08:38.041
[female dispatcher chattering
on radio]

08:38.116 --> 08:41.678
I know-- I know
what this looks like.

08:41.953 --> 08:46.016
Two guns, two thugs,
two law-abiding victims...

08:46.092 --> 08:48.823
and very, very
understanding officers.

08:48.895 --> 08:51.364
Yeah? You're all under arrest
for armed robbery.

08:51.697 --> 08:54.598
I want a phone call, I want a
lawyer, I want a cup of coffee.

08:54.667 --> 08:56.328
I want this ink
off my fingers.

08:58.337 --> 09:00.465
It's under your fingernails,
you can't get it out.

09:00.873 --> 09:03.399
You have to turn over
all your personal possessions.

09:03.643 --> 09:05.975
Better make sure
nothing happens to my gold.

09:09.348 --> 09:12.511
Everything I own
has to go into this.

09:19.859 --> 09:21.190
(Bickford)
Well...

09:21.260 --> 09:24.059
looks like you two are
going away for a long time.

09:24.130 --> 09:26.758
Yeah, let me tell you
something. Number one...

09:26.832 --> 09:30.359
I'm initiating a $35 million lawsuit
against this Sheriff's Department.

09:30.436 --> 09:32.404
And secondly,
nobody here offered us lunch.

09:32.471 --> 09:36.499
Nobody had the common decency to ask us if
we'd anything to eat in the last 24 hours.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.544
Real wise guy.
Cool it, Murdock.

09:38.611 --> 09:41.239
B.A., we have our rights.

09:41.847 --> 09:45.579
Now, I insist that you
interrogate those two guys.

09:45.651 --> 09:47.449
Get them to tell you
the truth.

09:47.520 --> 09:50.785
This guy here was chasing me because I
was being held hostage in that van.

09:50.856 --> 09:53.484
Really? I just got out
with those two.

09:54.260 --> 09:58.288
Logan and Malcolm are two
wanted killers in two states.

09:58.364 --> 10:00.856
I have a signed
written confession.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.928
They told me you two
planned the whole thing.

10:04.003 --> 10:07.803
And in addition to that, one of them said
he didn't want to go along with it...

10:07.974 --> 10:10.102
but the big guy there
threatened him.

10:10.242 --> 10:12.643
That's lies!
That is 1,000 lies!

10:12.712 --> 10:15.682
I mean, does he look like the kind
of guy who would threaten somebody?

10:18.684 --> 10:20.618
Let me rephrase that question.

10:20.686 --> 10:22.450
Don't push me, Jack.

10:29.662 --> 10:32.097
We in big trouble now.
We in big trouble, guy.

10:32.164 --> 10:33.222
[phone ringing]

10:33.299 --> 10:36.496
By the time those bozos figure out that
we didn't pull off that robbery...

10:36.569 --> 10:38.560
your fingerprints
are going to be in Washington.

10:38.638 --> 10:40.402
And they're gonna figure out
who you are.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.736
We're gonna be dead men.

10:41.807 --> 10:44.105
And I had my lucky rabbit's
foot with me and everything.

10:44.176 --> 10:47.043
You know, B.A., you didn't have to
get in that car and chase that van.

10:47.113 --> 10:48.274
I would've brought it back.

10:48.347 --> 10:51.112
Man, how I know they wasn't gonna
hurt you or shoot you or something?

10:51.183 --> 10:54.244
Wait a minute. Are you telling me,
that you got into that car...

10:54.320 --> 10:56.448
and chased that van 'cause
you were worried about me?

10:56.922 --> 10:59.857
I was worried about my van. I
knew it was too good to last.

10:59.925 --> 11:02.485
You really care about me. You
were really worried about me...

11:02.561 --> 11:05.189
weren't you, you big guardian-type guy?
I cared about my van!

11:05.264 --> 11:06.891
(Murdock) Oh no, you didn't.
I did, too.

11:06.966 --> 11:08.024
Did not.
I did.

11:08.100 --> 11:09.534
[laughing] Did not. I did.

11:09.902 --> 11:12.997
Okay, you two. We're taking
you down to the work farm.

11:13.072 --> 11:16.372
You got any phone calls,
now is the time to make them.

11:16.575 --> 11:18.543
Fingerprinted?
Yeah.

11:18.611 --> 11:21.171
I got that black ink all over my
fingers, under my fingernails.

11:21.247 --> 11:22.942
It's a killer to get off
and I hate it.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.642
It'll take me about two hours
to get there.

11:24.717 --> 11:26.116
Come on, you got
to have a plan, Colonel.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.711
I hope you have a plan, 'cause you
got to get us out of this one.

11:28.788 --> 11:32.486
When that computer sends B.A.'s
fingerprints back, they'll know who he is.

11:32.558 --> 11:34.754
I don't know how long it will
take Decker to get there.

11:34.927 --> 11:37.089
Now, I don't want anyone
to talk to the prisoner.

11:37.163 --> 11:39.689
And don't release him
to anyone until I get there.

11:39.765 --> 11:40.926
And thank you.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.136
Captain Crane.

11:46.706 --> 11:49.403
You are not gonna believe this.
It had to happen.

11:49.475 --> 11:53.378
Some small-town sheriff
just arrested B.A. Baracus.

11:53.746 --> 11:57.410
He put his prints out on the wire
and just got a confirmation back.

11:57.583 --> 11:59.176
I'll get a car and some men.

11:59.251 --> 12:01.219
We'll be ready to leave
in 10 minutes, sir.

12:01.287 --> 12:03.722
Very good, Captain,
very good.

12:11.263 --> 12:13.231
[birds chirping]

12:45.931 --> 12:48.901
All right. Out of the truck.
Up to building B.

12:48.968 --> 12:51.232
You know B.A.,
this might not be so bad.

12:51.303 --> 12:52.828
I mean, we get
three squares a day...

12:52.905 --> 12:54.873
plenty of exercise,
get that old pump going.

12:54.940 --> 12:57.409
It might be real neat. We'd
get to clear some weeds...

12:57.476 --> 12:59.740
dig a few holes, maybe even
a drainage ditch or two.

12:59.812 --> 13:02.543
Okay, got a few things
you fellows ought to hear.

13:02.748 --> 13:05.046
I don't wanna spend
too much time with you scum.

13:06.285 --> 13:09.778
So I'm going to tell you the rules
once and you better follow.

13:11.290 --> 13:12.917
Wake up at 7:00 a.m.

13:15.861 --> 13:18.023
Breakfast at 7:15.

13:18.097 --> 13:21.692
Work car leaves 8:00,
returns at 6:00.

13:22.001 --> 13:24.231
Dinner at 7:00,
lights out at 9:00.

13:24.303 --> 13:26.237
You stay in line
and everyone's happy.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.164
Step out of line...

13:29.708 --> 13:32.075
and I get real unhappy.

13:32.411 --> 13:35.938
And that will make you
real unhappy.

13:36.782 --> 13:38.750
Got it?
Excuse me, Sir.

13:38.984 --> 13:43.319
For breakfast in the morning, I'll
have my eggs poached, very, very soft.

13:43.389 --> 13:46.154
And bacon, extra crispy,
on the side...

13:46.425 --> 13:49.122
and half a melon or guava.

13:50.095 --> 13:53.463
Maybe I should show you what this
stick can do to a fella's skull.

13:58.204 --> 14:01.333
If you wanna stay alive, you
better keep your mouth shut.

14:01.407 --> 14:03.068
Or I'll nail it shut.

14:05.544 --> 14:07.137
I owe you one.

14:07.346 --> 14:10.714
If you try something, you better
make sure I don't get up.

14:16.488 --> 14:19.185
I hope the Colonel comes up
with a plan in a hurry.

14:19.458 --> 14:21.950
(Hannibal) Colonel Decker.
United States Army.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.027
Boy,
you sure got here fast.

14:24.396 --> 14:26.831
We didn't call your office
more than an hour ago.

14:26.899 --> 14:29.231
Military moves fast, Sheriff,
when it comes to the A-Team.

14:29.301 --> 14:31.326
We've been after this Baracus
for a long time.

14:31.403 --> 14:33.462
We haven't been able to come
up with anything more...

14:33.539 --> 14:35.507
on that crazy guy
he was picked up with.

14:35.574 --> 14:37.804
But boy,
can you imagine it?

14:37.877 --> 14:40.574
Catching one of the A-Team
right here in Green County.

14:40.646 --> 14:42.444
Outstanding, Sheriff.

14:42.815 --> 14:46.080
I'd appreciate it if you'd turn
over the arrest records...

14:46.151 --> 14:47.915
and the fingerprints
on both these men...

14:47.987 --> 14:50.115
as well as any personal
effects they might have.

14:50.189 --> 14:53.386
The military would like to continue
the investigation from here on.

14:53.459 --> 14:54.449
Right.

14:54.660 --> 14:58.824
Maynard, could you bring in all the
personal effects of both prisoners?

15:16.815 --> 15:19.284
Here's the paperwork
that your office requested.

15:19.952 --> 15:23.115
If you'll just sign this
release, Colonel. Yes, sir.

15:24.490 --> 15:27.221
The camp where we're holding them
is about 10 miles from here.

15:27.293 --> 15:30.422
Thank you very much, Sheriff.
Thank you, Colonel.

15:35.334 --> 15:37.268
[typewriter clacking]

15:42.408 --> 15:44.706
Excuse me.
Sheriff Bickford?

15:44.843 --> 15:47.005
I'm Colonel Decker.
United States Army.

15:47.079 --> 15:49.411
I have the release papers
for B.A. Baracus.

15:57.056 --> 15:59.047
I gotta hand it to you,
Face.

15:59.124 --> 16:02.492
I found Becker's ID in the car trunk.
It's perfect.

16:02.561 --> 16:07.021
Ah, Hannibal, I was saving that
as a surprise for your birthday.

16:07.099 --> 16:09.761
[chuckling] Well, you can get
me something else. Now, listen.

16:09.835 --> 16:11.997
I'm almost at the camp,
and I got the release papers.

16:12.071 --> 16:13.197
We'll meet you in LA.

16:13.272 --> 16:17.937
Okay, as soon as things come together down
here, I'll catch the first flight out.

16:18.010 --> 16:19.273
Take care, pal.

16:19.778 --> 16:20.768
Ciao.

16:21.480 --> 16:23.539
I promise
that's the last phone call.

17:18.203 --> 17:19.932
Can I get some water? Water?

17:22.641 --> 17:24.006
Guys are real nice,
you see?

17:24.076 --> 17:26.909
You treat people with respect,
they'll give it back to you.

17:26.979 --> 17:29.243
You gotta talk to them
the right way.

17:32.317 --> 17:33.785
Thanks, squat face.

17:36.889 --> 17:38.015
[metallic clanging]

17:38.624 --> 17:41.491
You are dead meat.

17:41.660 --> 17:44.721
Come on, Logan. Cool it, man.
Patty's gonna be here, right?

17:44.797 --> 17:45.889
Back off!

17:46.965 --> 17:48.057
You.

17:48.801 --> 17:51.862
Pick it up! This isn't working
out the way I expected.

17:54.473 --> 17:55.941
You got something to say?

17:56.608 --> 17:58.804
What the hell's going on here?

17:58.877 --> 18:00.606
Uh, pick broke.

18:01.413 --> 18:03.814
You got termites here.
Look at that there.

18:03.882 --> 18:06.943
Ugly little fellows. They'll gnaw on
anything if you give them a chance.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.328
[horn honking]

18:31.176 --> 18:34.544
Hey! (all) Hey!

18:40.686 --> 18:41.847
What's wrong?

18:42.154 --> 18:45.021
Now, if I knew what was wrong
with my truck here...

18:45.090 --> 18:47.855
I don't suppose I'd be
standing here talking to you.

18:48.360 --> 18:49.521
Now, would I?

18:50.162 --> 18:53.132
Well, we can push it off
on the side of the road.

18:54.066 --> 18:56.797
I have a work gang of prisoners
I got to watch out for here.

18:57.503 --> 19:00.564
And I got a .38 special
says otherwise.

19:01.573 --> 19:02.734
[gun firing]

19:04.643 --> 19:06.668
Now you tell them
to drop their weapons.

19:08.380 --> 19:11.145
All right. Put your guns on the ground.
You, too.

19:13.685 --> 19:17.451
Uh-uh, your left hand,
nice and easy.

19:19.925 --> 19:21.950
I knew you could do it.

19:25.464 --> 19:26.863
Hey, Pedroza?

19:29.668 --> 19:30.863
Nice, yes?
[giggles]

19:48.353 --> 19:51.345
Use them. Give it to him.

20:00.299 --> 20:03.735
That's for the one I owe you.
Let's go!

20:15.814 --> 20:18.146
He's wounded pretty bad. We
gotta get him to a hospital.

20:18.217 --> 20:20.709
If we take him in, that
means we give ourselves up.

20:20.786 --> 20:23.881
Yeah, I know. But he's gonna
die if we don't.

20:24.489 --> 20:26.150
Okay, let's go.

20:30.295 --> 20:31.660
(Murdock) ls this an
emergency room or what?

20:31.730 --> 20:33.289
I got a man,
with holes in him!

20:33.365 --> 20:35.424
Holes. Wounded man!

20:36.235 --> 20:39.933
I see a lot of patients,
but I don't see no doctors.

20:40.005 --> 20:42.667
What happened to him? Gunshot wound.
Lost a lot of blood.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.675
Get him in to OR right away.
Yeah.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.845
This is Nurse Morgan,
in Emergency.

20:47.913 --> 20:49.574
Send security
down here right away.

20:49.648 --> 20:51.878
We have a wounded Deputy.
He's hurt real bad.

20:57.923 --> 20:59.721
Uh, we train dogs.

20:59.825 --> 21:01.520
Special dog collars.

21:01.593 --> 21:03.891
We better get out of here.
Posthastily.

21:04.763 --> 21:06.231
Wrong direction.

21:06.832 --> 21:08.095
We'll catch you later,
really.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.361
This is a...

21:09.434 --> 21:10.424
I know what it...

21:13.639 --> 21:16.904
This has Hannibal Smith, written all
over it! First he impersonates me.

21:16.975 --> 21:20.605
Then he starts a prison break. Just
hope that young deputy can help us.

21:21.480 --> 21:22.914
They're inside
the hospital.

21:22.981 --> 21:24.540
Who? Two men,
handcuffed together.

21:24.616 --> 21:27.415
Two security guards chased them down
the corridor, but they lost them.

21:27.486 --> 21:28.681
A big black guy
with a Mohawk?

21:28.954 --> 21:30.422
Yeah, and another guy
with him.

21:30.489 --> 21:32.548
Baracus.
And maybe Peck's with him.

21:32.824 --> 21:35.259
Roy,
secure all the exits.

21:35.360 --> 21:38.125
I don't want anybody leaving this
hospital without being cleared.

21:38.196 --> 21:40.290
I'll take my men and work
our way down from the top.

21:40.365 --> 21:43.027
We'll start with the basement
and work up.

21:50.475 --> 21:53.604
B.A.? I'd like to take this opportunity
to tell you I'm real sorry...

21:53.679 --> 21:55.443
that they took your gold
back in prison.

21:55.514 --> 21:58.882
Oh, that's all right. If I don't get
it back, I'll just have to kill you.

22:04.489 --> 22:06.014
I got to make a call.

22:15.667 --> 22:17.897
Outside line,
Mobile Operator please.

22:17.969 --> 22:19.801
Got to get these cuffs off.

22:19.871 --> 22:21.862
You know, it's an actual
documented fact...

22:21.940 --> 22:24.136
that a coyote
will chew his leg off...

22:24.209 --> 22:25.574
to get out of a trap.

22:25.777 --> 22:27.745
You got any
coyote blood in you?

22:29.381 --> 22:30.815
[cell phone ringing]

22:43.729 --> 22:45.663
Yeah?
Colonel, am I glad I got you.

22:45.731 --> 22:48.632
B.A. and I are at
the Green County Hospital.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.725
<i>You or BA. 'nun'? (Murdock) No.
We are fine.</i>

22:50.802 --> 22:52.930
There was a breakout
and one of the guards was hit.

22:53.004 --> 22:54.529
I know about that.
I'm with Pedroza.

22:54.606 --> 22:57.405
He told me some miniskirt with
a .38 busted Deke Logan out.

22:57.476 --> 22:58.671
Yeah, you got it.

22:58.744 --> 23:02.009
But you gotta pony express it to
a place called the Russell farm.

23:02.080 --> 23:03.844
It's off Junction 18.

23:04.149 --> 23:07.517
<i>There's a woman living there with her kid.
I overheard Logan say...</i>

23:07.586 --> 23:10.214
he was gonna have a good time making
life pretty miserable for them.

23:10.288 --> 23:12.052
Understood. I'm on my way.

23:12.124 --> 23:14.684
This place is going to be crawling
with Decker bugs in a minute.

23:14.760 --> 23:17.354
B.A. and I'll find a way out of here.
Then we'll meet you there.

23:17.429 --> 23:18.555
Okay, take care.

23:27.372 --> 23:28.464
Go, move.

23:41.019 --> 23:45.183
Deputy, can you help me get this big
guy in the back of the truck here?

23:45.490 --> 23:46.480
The ambulance.

23:46.758 --> 23:48.055
Thanks.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.027
God bless you, sir.

24:00.972 --> 24:02.633
[tires screeching]

24:11.049 --> 24:12.813
[siren wailing]

24:53.091 --> 24:54.581
[people chattering]

24:55.193 --> 24:57.093
N'[country music playing]

25:12.110 --> 25:14.408
I'm sure glad
you guys got here.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.280
No problem, Deke.

25:16.648 --> 25:20.050
What did you say about having a
bag of money stashed somewhere?

25:20.118 --> 25:21.586
That's right.

25:22.554 --> 25:26.184
From a bank job Malcolm and
I did over four years ago.

25:27.025 --> 25:29.426
Got it hidden
on the Russell farm.

25:30.195 --> 25:32.823
Almost $100,000 in cash.

25:33.965 --> 25:34.989
[chuckling]

25:35.066 --> 25:37.967
Kyle likes that. You like
that, don't you, Kyle?

25:38.503 --> 25:40.437
I thought you would.

25:42.507 --> 25:45.135
Now, honey, I thought we were
heading straight out of state?

25:45.777 --> 25:47.836
You didn't say nothing
about no Russell farm.

25:48.513 --> 25:50.345
I don't tell you everything.

25:50.849 --> 25:54.877
But they got my money,
and I'm gonna get it.

25:56.922 --> 25:59.857
We got half the state looking for us.
So what?

26:00.225 --> 26:03.661
That's suicide. I'm not
going to let you do it.

26:05.263 --> 26:09.757
Nobody tells me what I can
and what I can't do.

26:11.303 --> 26:13.328
Well, I'm not going.
What did you say?

26:13.838 --> 26:16.500
I said I'm not going.
Leaving me?

26:18.677 --> 26:20.441
Nobody leaves me.

26:21.413 --> 26:24.405
Deke, come on.
For God's sake, Deke.

26:25.317 --> 26:26.842
You shut your mouth.

26:27.986 --> 26:30.387
And you keep that
mouth of yours shut.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.235
[birds chirping]

26:58.183 --> 26:59.708
Son, is this
the Russell place?

26:59.784 --> 27:01.309
Hold it right there, mister.

27:03.521 --> 27:04.852
You're one dead man.

27:11.997 --> 27:14.932
My name is Hannibal Smith.
I've come to help you.

27:15.667 --> 27:16.896
Toby, come here.

27:17.769 --> 27:18.793
How do I know that?

27:18.870 --> 27:21.464
I heard on the radio there was a
prison break not far from here.

27:21.539 --> 27:23.405
There's a reward
for the escaped prisoners.

27:23.475 --> 27:26.342
Well, I'm not one of them. You got
a big problem coming here, lady.

27:26.411 --> 27:28.209
His name is Deke Logan.

27:28.346 --> 27:30.280
Now. come on. We'll get
your stuff together.

27:30.348 --> 27:31.509
[hens clucking]

27:42.994 --> 27:45.725
Operator?
Give me the Sheriff.

27:46.431 --> 27:47.694
Operator?

27:50.869 --> 27:52.098
Line's dead.

27:53.038 --> 27:56.565
They must have cut it at the junction
at the road. Now let's get out of here.

27:56.708 --> 27:58.642
But how do I know
you're not working with Logan?

27:58.710 --> 28:00.678
If I was working with Logan,
you'd be dead.

28:00.745 --> 28:03.942
Now, lady, they already cut your phone
line, they're gonna be here any minute.

28:04.015 --> 28:05.039
Let's go.

28:05.116 --> 28:07.676
Ma, there's a car
coming down the road.

28:08.153 --> 28:09.450
Have you got
any other weapons?

28:09.521 --> 28:11.080
No.
I'm sorry, that's it.

28:12.223 --> 28:14.920
Lock all doors and windows. And
see if you can find some hose.

28:14.993 --> 28:16.620
I think there's some
in the basement.

28:25.904 --> 28:27.838
(Hannibal)
That's close enough, Logan.

28:27.906 --> 28:29.135
[gun firing]

28:51.129 --> 28:52.824
[guns firing]

28:56.301 --> 28:57.291
[gun firing]

29:00.004 --> 29:01.130
Stay down!

29:04.008 --> 29:05.567
Here's the hose.
What's it for?

29:06.511 --> 29:08.536
It's a little backup
when we run out of ammunition.

29:08.980 --> 29:10.379
Now, I need a pair of pliers.

29:10.482 --> 29:11.847
In the drawer.

29:12.617 --> 29:15.348
[guns continue firing]

29:18.056 --> 29:20.150
Take him to the basement
and tell him to be quiet.

30:01.733 --> 30:04.600
I can't believe that we're
fugitives from a chain gang.

30:04.669 --> 30:08.435
Manacled together, partners in
a desperate bid for freedom.

30:08.506 --> 30:10.873
Two men alone
against the odds.

30:11.142 --> 30:14.510
And 100 men out to get us
with orders: "Shoot to kill."

30:14.579 --> 30:16.911
Oh man, just shut up
and concentrate on the road.

30:16.981 --> 30:19.382
I don't wanna hear about
how many men are chasing us.

30:19.450 --> 30:20.747
You're nervous.

30:20.952 --> 30:22.078
You know why?

30:23.087 --> 30:24.885
You're just like
most modern men.

30:25.223 --> 30:29.182
You are afraid to lose control.
That's why you can't fly.

30:29.294 --> 30:32.195
You can't be a passenger,
you must have control.

30:32.297 --> 30:34.925
Control, control--
Shut up.

30:35.667 --> 30:39.729
You know, B.A., you could go a little
slower. A man could get windburn out here.

30:39.804 --> 30:41.829
Oh man,
just shut up and hold on.

30:43.174 --> 30:45.370
Uh-oh, we're in trouble.
What's the matter?

30:46.177 --> 30:48.509
Oil's leaking.
Must have a cracked oil pan.

30:48.813 --> 30:51.373
Boy, you really do know
about cars, don't you?

30:52.984 --> 30:54.918
[both coughing]

30:58.723 --> 31:00.919
Man, that 's the longest
dipstick I ever did see.

31:01.759 --> 31:04.490
Ain't any use looking at it, fool,
the engine's gone. Forget it.

31:04.562 --> 31:06.428
Oh boy, just great.

31:06.497 --> 31:08.625
What else could go wrong,
big guy?

31:08.700 --> 31:10.361
<i>(man)
This is Central Control.</i>

31:10.435 --> 31:14.065
<i>We have a report of a stolen ambulance
seen heading east on Mill Basin Road.</i>

31:16.140 --> 31:18.507
<i>(Decker) This is Colonel
Decker, Military Police.</i>

31:18.877 --> 31:21.107
<i>We're turning onto
Mill Basin Road headed east.</i>

31:21.179 --> 31:23.238
<i>We'll try to overtake
the fleeing fugitives.</i>

31:23.314 --> 31:25.840
Man, we gotta get out of here. Won't
take them long to get up here.

31:25.917 --> 31:27.817
We gotta... We gotta
think of something fast.

31:27.886 --> 31:28.944
I got it.

31:37.662 --> 31:40.723
Looks like something parked off the
side of the road just up ahead.

31:41.566 --> 31:43.762
I think it's the ambulance,
Colonel.

31:56.114 --> 31:57.673
You men check the brush.

32:04.956 --> 32:06.583
[birds chirping]

32:25.677 --> 32:27.509
Smells like they cooked
this engine.

32:27.578 --> 32:30.047
Colonel, we found footprints
leading away from the ambulance...

32:30.114 --> 32:31.604
into the ravine over there.

32:32.984 --> 32:36.887
Well, well, if Baracus and that other
prisoner he's handcuffed to...

32:36.955 --> 32:40.391
are crazy enough to think that they
can make it out of here on foot...

32:40.458 --> 32:42.153
they won't get very far.

32:43.061 --> 32:45.996
We'll take the car, use the
back road and head them off.

32:46.064 --> 32:47.429
Let's move out, men!

33:19.397 --> 33:23.391
Hey, man, it's not gonna take Decker long
to find out we laid down a false trail.

33:23.701 --> 33:25.829
We gotta get out of here
and catch up with Hannibal.

33:26.070 --> 33:28.232
[guns firing]

33:37.081 --> 33:39.015
That's all we got left,
sorry.

33:40.118 --> 33:43.019
We sure haven't got enough
firepower to hold them off.

33:47.492 --> 33:52.157
Would you mind telling me why our friends
out there are so anxious to come inside?

33:52.697 --> 33:54.426
Logan and my husband
were partners.

33:54.499 --> 33:57.730
They robbed the Franklinville Bank
together. Police never found the money.

33:57.802 --> 33:59.463
Logan must think it's here.

33:59.537 --> 34:01.801
Is it?
No. I don't know where it is.

34:09.147 --> 34:10.614
That's it for the shotgun.

34:11.849 --> 34:14.216
Where's your husband?
He's dead.

34:22.627 --> 34:24.686
I don't think we can hold
them off much longer.

34:25.496 --> 34:27.157
Well, I got
some friends coming.

34:27.598 --> 34:30.397
Let's just hope
that they get here fast.

34:38.909 --> 34:41.106
The Wind's starting
to howl and kick up.

34:42.413 --> 34:44.005
It gives me an idea.

34:45.550 --> 34:47.484
Let's get back
to the ambulance.

36:50.074 --> 36:51.303
I gotta get in there.

36:54.812 --> 36:56.075
Cover me.

36:58.015 --> 36:59.005
[flames roaring]

37:05.656 --> 37:06.646
[rifle firing]

37:16.334 --> 37:17.995
Sounded like a dumb idea.

37:18.402 --> 37:20.803
But I gotta hand it to you,
Murdock, it works.

37:31.048 --> 37:33.983
Pioneers used to do it all the
time with them covered wagons.

37:34.051 --> 37:35.610
They called them
prairie schooners.

37:35.686 --> 37:38.280
You see, what you do is
you take the wind factor...

37:38.356 --> 37:40.381
the humidity level,
and the temperature...

37:40.458 --> 37:42.893
and you divide that by the
square footage of your sail...

37:42.960 --> 37:45.361
then you multiply that
by the weight of your vehicle.

37:46.063 --> 37:48.464
[in pioneer accent] And
then you just hope and pray

37:48.532 --> 37:51.263
that that wind
keeps blowing, Hoppy.

37:53.738 --> 37:56.537
So, according to this map we only
have a couple more miles to go.

37:56.607 --> 37:58.166
I sure hope
we get there in time.

37:58.242 --> 38:00.370
Heidi-heidi-ho!

38:00.444 --> 38:01.741
Yes, sir.

38:07.885 --> 38:09.785
Okay, follow behind.

38:12.523 --> 38:13.513
Come on.

38:15.726 --> 38:17.057
[guns continue firing]

38:21.198 --> 38:22.461
Lose it.

38:23.401 --> 38:24.391
[drops hose]

38:24.835 --> 38:27.304
So, you're Deke Logan?

38:28.606 --> 38:31.166
Yeah, that's right.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.504
Now, you wanna tell me
your name?

38:34.779 --> 38:35.837
No.

38:35.913 --> 38:36.903
[chuckles]

38:44.121 --> 38:46.317
After I get through
with my business here...

38:46.891 --> 38:49.019
you and me are gonna
have a little talk.

38:53.798 --> 38:58.360
Now, are you gonna tell me
where the money is...

38:58.436 --> 39:00.700
or do I have to feed you
to the hogs?

39:01.038 --> 39:02.733
[all imitating hogs grunting]

39:07.311 --> 39:09.780
(Patty) Hello? I wanna
speak to the Sheriff.

39:10.848 --> 39:14.512
Sheriff? If you're looking
for Deke Logan...

39:15.152 --> 39:18.850
I can help you.
I know where he is.

39:21.859 --> 39:24.658
Sam never showed up with any of the
money after that bank robbery.

39:24.729 --> 39:26.219
I don't know
what he did with it.

39:26.731 --> 39:28.790
(Logan) We took $100,000
from that bank.

39:29.734 --> 39:33.295
And you're telling me that he
showed up here empty-handed?

39:33.437 --> 39:34.836
I'm not lying.

39:34.905 --> 39:37.499
There's no money.
I'm telling you the truth!

39:37.575 --> 39:39.669
I don't believe you, miss.

39:41.278 --> 39:45.408
If you wanna know where it is,
I can show you.

39:47.084 --> 39:48.848
You know where the money is?

39:48.919 --> 39:53.049
Yeah, it's buried in that
field out behind that shed.

39:53.457 --> 39:57.360
Sam called me about a week before
he died, told me where it was.

39:58.262 --> 40:00.822
Said he was afraid if he told
Callie, she'd give it back.

40:06.237 --> 40:11.107
And you were gonna dig it up
and keep it all for yourself.

40:11.442 --> 40:12.466
You bet.

40:15.212 --> 40:16.338
Get a shovel.

40:16.414 --> 40:18.712
Watch the back road
and see nobody comes.

40:18.783 --> 40:20.251
We'll stay here.

40:24.789 --> 40:26.951
Come over here, we gotta
get these bracelets off.

40:27.024 --> 40:29.493
Over here. No, man, this way.
I see a toolbox.

40:29.860 --> 40:31.385
[both grunting]

40:35.166 --> 40:36.964
This should do it.

40:37.034 --> 40:39.230
What you gonna do?
What do you need?

40:39.303 --> 40:40.930
Oh, Lord be praised.

40:41.439 --> 40:44.431
Colonel is gonna need all the support
we can give. Hurry, hurry, hurry.

40:44.508 --> 40:45.600
Yeah.

40:49.780 --> 40:51.145
Okay, where is it?

40:52.316 --> 40:54.842
It's 13 paces off
the corner of this shed.

40:56.086 --> 40:57.451
Count them.

41:08.032 --> 41:09.193
Right there.

41:10.601 --> 41:11.693
All right.

41:13.404 --> 41:14.872
Start digging-

41:16.807 --> 41:18.605
What an ugly-looking
scarecrow.

41:19.510 --> 41:20.773
Malcolm.

41:21.011 --> 41:22.308
Save that ammo.

41:45.369 --> 41:47.997
Hey man, he's gone down pretty far.
Where the hell is it?

41:48.405 --> 41:50.897
There's no money in there.
We would've found it already.

41:50.975 --> 41:54.707
Oh no, Russell said he buried it deep.
We'll come to it right away.

42:12.630 --> 42:14.860
Well, we've come
to the end of the road, pal.

42:15.599 --> 42:17.363
You just dug yourself
a grave.

42:17.434 --> 42:19.402
No, this is too short for me.

42:24.909 --> 42:26.104
[explosion sounds]

43:15.259 --> 43:17.421
And you call me ugly,
turtle nose.

43:19.496 --> 43:22.864
Not bad, Murdock.
For a straw man.

43:24.001 --> 43:26.402
Have you ever hired yourself out, Mr.
Smith?

43:26.470 --> 43:29.405
I'm sure there are a lot of people
out there who could use your help.

43:29.473 --> 43:33.103
Well, we ought
to think about that. Eh, guys?

43:33.177 --> 43:34.736
Yeah.
Yeah.

44:07.544 --> 44:11.208
Well, Callie, you got yourself a nice
reward for catching Logan and the others.

44:11.548 --> 44:14.415
I expect there's a reward
for the A-Team, too.

44:15.953 --> 44:18.547
Help me find them.
They saved our lives, Sheriff.

44:18.622 --> 44:19.680
If it wasn't for them...

44:19.757 --> 44:22.249
Toby and I wouldn't be standing
here talking to you right now.

44:22.326 --> 44:24.124
I can't give you
any help with that.

44:24.328 --> 44:25.853
I can appreciate that,
Callie.

44:29.199 --> 44:32.635
They got to be in this area
somewhere. Let's go.

44:34.772 --> 44:36.968
<i>[female dispatcher
chattering on radio]</i>

44:49.953 --> 44:53.446
(Hannibal) When we cross that state
line, we're safe from the Sheriff.

44:53.524 --> 44:55.652
And I don't see
a sign of Decker.

44:56.260 --> 44:58.991
Stop moving around, Murdock, and
get your elbow out of my side.

44:59.396 --> 45:01.990
I wouldn't worry
about Decker, Colonel.

45:02.433 --> 45:05.130
I got my lucky
rabbit's foot with us.

45:05.202 --> 45:06.966
This little baby's
gonna take care of us.

45:07.037 --> 45:08.334
I wouldn't worry
about nothing.

45:08.405 --> 45:10.737
Hey, that thing ain't brought
us nothing but bad luck.

45:10.808 --> 45:11.798
Give it here.
No.

45:12.009 --> 45:15.673
Okay, I mean,
I will admit that...

45:16.080 --> 45:19.914
running into Deke Logan, being
thrown on a chain gang...

45:20.017 --> 45:23.749
Decker, the prison escape, it could
be construed as a streak of bad luck.

45:23.821 --> 45:27.382
But I dismiss all that now because
this baby has recharged its batteries.

45:27.458 --> 45:30.120
And I guarantee you,
big brother...

45:30.194 --> 45:32.322
it's gonna take care
of us all the way back to LA.
