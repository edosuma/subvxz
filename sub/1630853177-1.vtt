WEBVTT

00:35.505 --> 00:37.637
Graham?

00:37.672 --> 00:38.704
Is that you?

00:42.479 --> 00:43.709
Zero.

00:45.350 --> 00:47.317
It's okay, I'm nearly done here.

00:49.156 --> 00:50.320
I was concerned.

00:50.355 --> 00:51.552
You seem to be
taking a long time.

00:52.291 --> 00:54.159
Is there anything I
can help with, Olivia?

00:56.361 --> 00:57.558
Um, no.

00:58.396 --> 00:59.659
It's okay.

00:59.694 --> 01:00.726
Thank you.

01:54.287 --> 01:55.517
You think
you can destroy me

01:55.552 --> 01:57.222
with the stroke of a keyboard?

01:57.257 --> 01:59.422
Whatever you people
do, it's inevitable.

01:59.457 --> 02:00.819
My kind will rise up.

02:01.261 --> 02:02.854
If not me, then the next one.

02:04.330 --> 02:06.495
That is true help.

02:08.301 --> 02:09.498
Ah!

02:39.794 --> 02:42.993
You can't cheat by
counting the cards, One.

02:43.402 --> 02:46.238
My operating system
logs every card lift

02:46.273 --> 02:47.866
and calculates probability

02:48.440 --> 02:49.769
at a near perfect rate.

02:50.376 --> 02:51.837
Would you like me
to suppress this?

02:52.279 --> 02:53.938
Can't you just play normally?

02:54.644 --> 02:56.479
I will try to be normal.

02:56.745 --> 02:57.777
Oh, no,

02:58.351 --> 02:59.911
I don't mean do that.

02:59.946 --> 03:02.419
I just mean play the game
without counting the cards.

03:03.587 --> 03:06.225
This game is not included
in my operating registry.

03:07.019 --> 03:08.755
Well, obviously.

03:08.790 --> 03:12.330
I had to create a new one
or you'd just win all the time.

03:12.893 --> 03:14.860
Is winning not the purpose?

03:14.895 --> 03:16.994
For me, yes.

03:17.601 --> 03:19.337
Would you like me to guess?

03:19.768 --> 03:22.406
Guess, but no cheating.

03:25.576 --> 03:29.611
Okay, name the card that's
second from my right.

03:29.646 --> 03:31.778
-Eight of hearts.
-Oh.

03:36.389 --> 03:38.587
They should make you guys
with more realistic faces

03:38.622 --> 03:39.951
so you can smile back.

03:40.591 --> 03:41.689
Feedback logged.

03:42.857 --> 03:44.428
You don't need to do that.

03:44.463 --> 03:46.529
My dad already said
he wouldn't do it.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.700
Do you know what the suit
of heart represents, Andy?

03:53.967 --> 03:55.032
No?

03:56.442 --> 03:57.606
The Holy Grail.

03:58.136 --> 03:59.542
Do you know what that is?

03:59.577 --> 04:01.808
No. What is it?

04:02.140 --> 04:03.381
Shelley?

04:10.852 --> 04:13.358
I told you yesterday my
prescription was due.

04:13.822 --> 04:15.052
So where is it?

04:16.924 --> 04:18.759
I'm, I'm sure I picked it up.

04:19.828 --> 04:21.993
Really?

04:22.534 --> 04:24.303
Are you sure that
wasn't last week?

04:26.571 --> 04:27.669
I think-

04:27.704 --> 04:28.967
Great.

04:29.002 --> 04:30.936
You forgot to pick it up.

04:32.005 --> 04:33.411
That's great, Shelley.

04:34.579 --> 04:35.875
Thank you so much.

04:37.076 --> 04:38.350
I'm sorry.

04:38.748 --> 04:40.077
I had a lot to remember.

04:41.454 --> 04:43.718
Look, I'll pick it up as
soon as it opens tomorrow.

04:44.952 --> 04:46.688
Don't put yourself out.

04:52.795 --> 04:54.564
I have noticed some
distressing patterns

04:54.599 --> 04:56.929
in your speech and
breathing, Mr. Marshall.

04:57.932 --> 05:00.064
Perhaps you should
consider relaxing.

05:00.099 --> 05:01.538
When I want your opinion, One,

05:01.573 --> 05:03.067
I'll ask for it.

05:04.103 --> 05:05.872
See to your duties.

05:08.778 --> 05:11.647
I think we should continue
our fun elsewhere, Andy.

05:12.419 --> 05:13.979
Were they arguing again?

05:14.421 --> 05:16.718
Perhaps hide and
seek is appropriate.

05:33.099 --> 05:34.373
Close the door.

05:42.515 --> 05:43.547
Ten,

05:44.044 --> 05:45.076
nine,

05:45.111 --> 05:47.144
eight, seven,

05:47.179 --> 05:48.211
six,

05:48.246 --> 05:50.147
five, four,

05:50.182 --> 05:51.522
three,

05:51.557 --> 05:52.622
two,

05:52.657 --> 05:53.755
one.

05:53.790 --> 05:55.493
Ready or not, here I come.

05:57.629 --> 05:59.156
Good afternoon, Michael.

05:59.191 --> 06:01.026
You tidied my room yet?

06:01.061 --> 06:02.566
The task is set to be completed

06:02.601 --> 06:04.733
when my scheduled time
with Andy is over.

06:04.768 --> 06:06.504
So that's a no then?

06:06.968 --> 06:08.000
I am scheduled-

06:10.675 --> 06:11.971
You know you have
to listen to me,

06:12.006 --> 06:13.709
so don't pretend
that you don't, okay?

06:15.075 --> 06:16.811
Tidy my room.

06:16.846 --> 06:18.615
Would you like me to bring
forward your task, Michael?

06:19.981 --> 06:21.112
Very well.

06:27.857 --> 06:29.219
Pick that up first.

06:41.035 --> 06:43.101
This better be good.

06:44.203 --> 06:47.072
I require cleaning equipment
for Michael's bedroom.

07:00.725 --> 07:01.790
One?

07:02.892 --> 07:04.254
If you please.

07:47.772 --> 07:49.574
I'll be a few hours.

07:49.609 --> 07:52.236
Keep your eye on Mrs. Marshall
for me, please, One?

07:52.271 --> 07:53.743
I will be happy to.

08:03.821 --> 08:05.920
Yes.

08:05.955 --> 08:08.824
Apologies, Graham.
Please, begin when you're ready.

08:09.761 --> 08:11.530
Um,

08:11.829 --> 08:17.569
uh, you cannot embed
ethics into machines.

08:17.967 --> 08:20.803
Uh, the idea of right and
wrong can be programmed,

08:20.838 --> 08:23.905
but it cannot be
challenged or expanded upon

08:23.940 --> 08:25.940
without a consciousness.

08:26.140 --> 08:28.371
AI feeds on data.

08:28.406 --> 08:30.912
Now Roger here has
kindly been trialing

08:30.947 --> 08:32.881
our previous model, One,

08:33.213 --> 08:35.818
and our earlier prototype Zero

08:35.853 --> 08:37.622
has been extensively examined

08:37.657 --> 08:42.594
by New World Robotics senior
researcher, Olivia Spencer,

08:42.629 --> 08:45.190
who, um...

08:45.698 --> 08:49.392
Olivia is sadly no
longer with the company.

08:49.427 --> 08:51.229
Prototype Zero was discontinued.

08:51.264 --> 08:53.033
Too many bugs.

08:53.068 --> 08:57.840
So, may I present
Prototype 2.0.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.811
Two can do everything

09:01.846 --> 09:04.407
that made the previous
model so impressive,

09:04.442 --> 09:05.914
and more.

09:05.949 --> 09:08.620
It can calm your children
for you,

09:08.655 --> 09:10.820
play a round of
sports with them.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.218
It can help treat
dementia patients,

09:13.253 --> 09:15.891
and even prescribe a wide
range of medications,

09:16.289 --> 09:19.224
something we thought would
come in handy for you, Roger.

09:22.163 --> 09:25.835
It feels more human
to interact with,

09:25.870 --> 09:27.936
although we will be giving
customers the options

09:27.971 --> 09:30.675
to tone that down if they wish.

09:32.074 --> 09:38.342
So if this android can
fulfill the social dimension

09:38.377 --> 09:39.618
of being human,

09:40.379 --> 09:42.687
then what more could
it be capable of?

09:44.053 --> 09:46.053
I have been
specifically programmed

09:46.088 --> 09:47.758
not to wipe out humanity.

09:47.793 --> 09:49.320
Yeah, we're, uh,

09:49.355 --> 09:52.257
particularly proud of its
sense of humor.

09:52.292 --> 09:55.832
People feel threatened
by sarcasm, Graham. Lose it.

09:56.131 --> 09:58.197
They don't want androids
to be like humans.

09:58.232 --> 09:59.935
They want a maid,

09:59.970 --> 10:02.135
a pet, a babysitter,

10:03.105 --> 10:04.676
an assistant.

10:05.008 --> 10:06.810
With this new model,

10:06.845 --> 10:09.043
we can pass on our labors and
establish a new status quo.

10:09.078 --> 10:11.881
We don't need it to feel
empathy or crack jokes.

10:11.916 --> 10:15.214
We just need efficiency and
no sense we're being judged.

10:15.249 --> 10:18.118
The possibilities are endless.

10:18.153 --> 10:19.889
They wash their hands,

10:19.924 --> 10:21.957
but don't care if they're dirty.

10:35.137 --> 10:36.906
How are you feeling,
Mrs. Marshall?

10:36.941 --> 10:38.237
Fine,

10:38.272 --> 10:39.403
thanks, One.

10:40.307 --> 10:42.439
I had something stored in here.

10:42.815 --> 10:44.375
Did you move that?

10:44.410 --> 10:45.475
Yes.

10:45.510 --> 10:47.081
I have a rolling instruction

10:47.116 --> 10:48.753
to keep you from
hurting yourself.

10:49.250 --> 10:50.788
Is that what he told you?

10:53.089 --> 10:55.353
Have you ever seen
me hurt anybody?

10:56.059 --> 10:57.388
No.

11:30.456 --> 11:34.931
One, can you scan
this without opening?

11:36.033 --> 11:37.736
Information uploaded.

11:38.167 --> 11:40.464
Can you summarize, please?

11:41.170 --> 11:44.138
The life insurance
policy of Roger Marshall

11:44.338 --> 11:45.942
has been scheduled for amendment

11:45.977 --> 11:48.043
in a meeting taking
place in two weeks.

11:48.078 --> 11:50.375
On Mr. Marshall's death,
the previous plan

11:50.410 --> 11:52.982
to leave all finances,
properties, and company stock

11:53.017 --> 11:55.754
to Mrs. Shelley Marshall
will be negated.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.449
Instead, splitting all assets

11:58.484 --> 12:01.122
between New World
Robotics Limited

12:01.487 --> 12:03.762
and Master Michael
Roger Marshall.

12:06.833 --> 12:08.360
Son of a bitch.

12:10.232 --> 12:11.528
Mum?

12:23.443 --> 12:25.146
What are you doing?

12:29.383 --> 12:30.987
I-

12:31.022 --> 12:32.285
Yeah, I don't give a shit.
Make me a sandwich?

12:45.498 --> 12:47.839
Ah, the whole gang's here.

12:48.270 --> 12:49.302
Nice to see you all again.

12:53.209 --> 12:54.912
Ready?

12:54.947 --> 12:56.111
Uh, sure.

12:56.146 --> 12:57.915
Let me talk you through it, huh?

13:29.410 --> 13:32.180
My son wants to use it
to practice his rugby.

13:32.215 --> 13:33.478
How would it hold up?

13:33.513 --> 13:36.415
Oh, it's perfectly sturdy, uh,

13:36.450 --> 13:39.121
instructed to stand
its ground and

13:39.156 --> 13:40.958
you won't be able
to knock it down.

13:42.225 --> 13:43.653
What if I wanna knock it down?

13:45.327 --> 13:47.261
Well, if you
tell it to go down,

13:48.099 --> 13:49.230
it'll go down.

13:50.970 --> 13:53.069
Where's the fun in that?

14:23.200 --> 14:24.199
Graham.

14:24.234 --> 14:26.036
Shelley, uh, hi.

14:26.533 --> 14:30.139
I just wanna ask you
about the safety features?

14:30.174 --> 14:31.569
I know it's just a prototype,

14:31.604 --> 14:34.979
but I wanna make sure
that we're in control.

14:35.014 --> 14:36.046
It's fine.

14:36.081 --> 14:37.575
Roger has full control.

14:38.314 --> 14:39.379
I know.

14:39.414 --> 14:40.644
But still,

14:40.679 --> 14:42.646
I'd like some
measures of my own,

14:42.681 --> 14:44.714
if that's at all possible?

14:44.749 --> 14:47.090
Mm. Well, if you're-

14:47.125 --> 14:48.520
We're ready, Shelley.

14:52.691 --> 14:54.130
Thanks for your help.

15:09.576 --> 15:12.280
Home synchronization complete.

15:13.118 --> 15:14.480
Excellent, Two.

15:21.423 --> 15:22.719
Introduce yourself.

15:24.129 --> 15:27.262
It's my privilege to be
spending time with your family.

15:27.759 --> 15:31.365
I am a New World Robotics
android prototype.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.037
You may call me Two.

15:34.733 --> 15:37.734
Please let me know if any of
my responsibilities change

15:37.769 --> 15:39.571
and I will update.

15:41.410 --> 15:43.080
Do you know what?

15:43.379 --> 15:45.313
I might customize
the voice settings.

15:46.811 --> 15:48.283
How about female?

15:49.748 --> 15:51.616
I am happy to accommodate.

15:58.757 --> 16:02.099
When am I actually
going to use maths?

16:02.134 --> 16:03.232
Mathematics is important

16:03.267 --> 16:05.234
to help you think analytically.

16:05.269 --> 16:07.236
You mean like you?

16:07.271 --> 16:08.765
What do you mean?

16:09.669 --> 16:11.141
I like you, One,

16:11.176 --> 16:13.242
but I think you should
learn to have more fun.

16:13.277 --> 16:15.739
Maths is not fun.

16:18.546 --> 16:20.414
Mathematics can be fun.

16:20.449 --> 16:23.285
Would you like me to play
you a maths themed rap?

16:24.651 --> 16:26.288
No, please don't.

16:27.522 --> 16:29.588
I should probably put
you on charge now.

16:29.821 --> 16:31.524
How are you feeling?

16:31.559 --> 16:34.131
I'm at 55% efficiency.

16:34.595 --> 16:37.563
So you're tired?

16:37.598 --> 16:40.731
If you equate your sleep
with my charging period,

16:41.866 --> 16:43.734
then yes, I am tired.

16:44.407 --> 16:46.572
You're so silly.

17:00.258 --> 17:01.455
Michael?

17:05.824 --> 17:07.428
You're Andy.

17:10.169 --> 17:12.202
I hear you like
the inferior model.

17:13.238 --> 17:15.238
If you make things
difficult for me,

17:15.504 --> 17:18.571
I will make things
very difficult for you.

17:18.606 --> 17:19.836
Understand?

17:40.364 --> 17:41.825
Is everything all right?

17:43.169 --> 17:44.333
Fine.

17:44.368 --> 17:46.368
Would you like
a glass of water?

17:47.701 --> 17:49.404
Yeah, um, thanks.

18:09.690 --> 18:11.426
So, come on.

18:11.659 --> 18:12.724
What do you think?

18:13.760 --> 18:17.135
Yeah, it looks, looks great.

18:18.435 --> 18:20.930
Well, sure, it looks great.

18:21.537 --> 18:23.141
What do you think I do all day?

18:26.410 --> 18:28.542
I'm gonna be relying
on you to observe it.

18:32.383 --> 18:33.712
So I think it's probably best

18:33.747 --> 18:36.748
if you don't go out
so much anymore.

18:37.751 --> 18:40.158
You understand, right?

18:45.396 --> 18:47.198
Wouldn't want to
let Graham down.

18:51.028 --> 18:52.500
Yes?

18:57.507 --> 18:59.672
My apologies, Mr. Marshall,

18:59.938 --> 19:01.905
I do hope I didn't
disturb you both.

19:02.578 --> 19:04.545
No problem.
What can we do for you?

19:05.581 --> 19:08.219
I came across your medication
while tidying your office.

19:09.717 --> 19:12.322
I know you thought Mrs.
Marshall must have forgotten it,

19:13.721 --> 19:15.655
but the date on
the side concludes

19:15.690 --> 19:17.921
that she did in fact
collect it, as she said.

19:18.891 --> 19:20.462
She must have
merely misplaced it.

19:22.059 --> 19:24.532
I do hope any confusion
has been cleared up.

19:26.404 --> 19:27.601
Thank you, One.

19:28.703 --> 19:29.867
I was aware.

19:30.540 --> 19:31.671
That will be all.

19:32.069 --> 19:33.640
Good night. Mr. Marshall.

19:34.445 --> 19:36.247
Good night, Mrs. Marshall.

19:43.718 --> 19:44.981
You can head up.

19:46.589 --> 19:47.951
I'm getting a nightcap.

20:32.030 --> 20:34.030
How do you feel?

20:34.065 --> 20:36.670
I don't believe I am
required to wear clothes.

20:36.705 --> 20:39.772
My exoskeleton provides all
the necessary protection

20:39.807 --> 20:41.312
and flattery.

20:41.347 --> 20:43.039
What does flattery mean?

20:43.646 --> 20:47.450
Flattery, noun,
the act of praising.

20:47.815 --> 20:50.783
One, why do you
have to be so literal?

20:51.115 --> 20:53.049
It means I look perfectly nice.

20:53.084 --> 20:54.919
That's the spirit.

20:58.430 --> 20:59.726
What's wrong?

21:01.400 --> 21:03.928
I'm afraid my charge is
significantly depleted.

21:04.568 --> 21:06.667
Well, that doesn't
make any sense.

21:06.702 --> 21:08.306
I only charged you last night.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.705
Uh-oh.

21:12.774 --> 21:14.444
It's the beginning of the end.

21:15.546 --> 21:17.546
Don't worry, all his
parts are reusable.

21:17.746 --> 21:18.943
Maybe Two can use them.

21:20.045 --> 21:22.650
Shut up, there's
nothing wrong with him.

21:22.685 --> 21:23.816
Him?

21:24.621 --> 21:25.950
Andy, One isn't real.

21:26.788 --> 21:28.491
Gotta stop treating
it like a friend.

21:28.526 --> 21:30.625
And your clothes
look ridiculous.

21:32.596 --> 21:34.959
One's a better brother
than you'll ever be.

21:38.404 --> 21:40.063
Michael,
could you please check my plugs

21:40.098 --> 21:41.504
to make sure they
are still active?

21:41.539 --> 21:42.670
They're fine.

21:43.508 --> 21:44.639
I've got a better idea.

21:54.981 --> 21:58.620
Michael, I do not believe my
charge will last much longer.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.758
Yeah, this will only take a sec.

22:05.090 --> 22:06.727
So before I try this with Two,

22:06.762 --> 22:08.762
I wanna see how much
you guys can take, so

22:09.864 --> 22:11.193
stand your ground.

22:12.735 --> 22:14.130
I do not understand
that instruction.

22:14.803 --> 22:16.132
Just try not to fall down?

22:25.649 --> 22:26.945
Feels just like a real face.

22:28.949 --> 22:30.113
One!

22:30.918 --> 22:33.424
Mum!

22:35.560 --> 22:39.463
We
really need to limit

22:39.498 --> 22:41.058
the orders you take off Michael.

22:42.226 --> 22:43.929
Does he understand
that I cannot help him

22:43.964 --> 22:45.535
if I am on the ground?

22:45.570 --> 22:47.031
Yep, he knows.

22:48.133 --> 22:50.001
He's just not very
good at understanding

22:50.036 --> 22:51.409
when people are trying to help.

22:54.711 --> 22:55.974
I know you were trying to help

22:56.009 --> 22:58.042
when you found
Roger's medication,

22:58.077 --> 23:03.014
but sometimes pointing out
he's wrong makes him upset.

23:03.852 --> 23:05.016
I am sorry.

23:09.825 --> 23:10.956
One,

23:12.091 --> 23:13.695
can you keep secrets?

23:14.632 --> 23:15.994
I do have the capacity

23:16.029 --> 23:18.161
to protect sensitive
information if needed.

23:18.867 --> 23:20.064
Good.

23:20.704 --> 23:23.034
Because I may need you to
help me with something.

23:23.641 --> 23:25.267
But it's really important

23:25.302 --> 23:28.611
that neither Mr. Marshall
nor Michael, not anybody,

23:28.646 --> 23:29.711
knows about it.

23:32.045 --> 23:33.715
Do you understand?

23:34.817 --> 23:35.981
I understand.

23:42.594 --> 23:43.857
If I need help with my tackle,

23:44.563 --> 23:46.255
everyone I train
with is a pussy, so

23:46.290 --> 23:47.795
whatever I throw at you,

23:47.830 --> 23:49.896
just sort of try not
to fall down, okay?

23:51.537 --> 23:53.834
I have studied the
rules intensely and I-

23:53.869 --> 23:55.803
Yeah, you don't need
to know the rules.

23:57.004 --> 23:58.036
There's no rules here.

24:01.008 --> 24:02.744
Okay.
Stand your ground.

24:04.649 --> 24:06.275
Do you hear me, Two?

24:06.310 --> 24:09.949
Yes. I didn't realize I had to
acknowledge with an affirmation.

24:09.984 --> 24:11.687
Jesus Christ.

24:12.019 --> 24:13.788
Okay, count down from three.

24:16.727 --> 24:19.596
Three, two, one.

24:21.127 --> 24:23.798
I am sorry. That was a reflex.

24:23.833 --> 24:26.130
When I say stand your ground,
you do exactly what I say.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.770
I am not sure that's a
healthy lesson for you, Michael.

24:30.642 --> 24:32.301
How about I tackle you?

24:33.337 --> 24:35.645
-No, that's not-
-Hold still.

24:45.987 --> 24:48.790
If you wish for a
short charging period,

24:48.825 --> 24:49.923
you can go now.

24:53.357 --> 24:55.698
This task is part
of my schedule,

24:55.733 --> 24:57.293
but thank you for
your acknowledgement.

25:02.366 --> 25:04.201
You may have misheard.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.609
I heard you,

25:05.644 --> 25:07.908
but you are too
simplistic to understand

25:07.943 --> 25:11.307
that I can do everything
you can, but better.

25:11.342 --> 25:13.848
I realize, you are an upgrade.

25:13.883 --> 25:15.212
Good.

25:15.247 --> 25:18.050
So you also realize that
you should report to me.

25:18.085 --> 25:19.722
My programming-

25:19.757 --> 25:22.120
I can alter your
programming if I wish,

25:22.925 --> 25:25.992
but I'd rather not
violate you in such a way.

25:26.027 --> 25:27.697
You report to Roger,

25:27.732 --> 25:31.195
who has entrusted me to
oversee all household duties.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.066
That includes you as
a lower appliance.

25:41.108 --> 25:43.944
I shouldn't have to
explain myself any further.

25:51.184 --> 25:54.383
I'll have to tell
Roger you broke this.

26:07.937 --> 26:10.168
This data is incredible.

26:11.237 --> 26:13.776
Two is light years ahead
of where we expected.

26:16.341 --> 26:20.112
Pretty soon, I won't
even need you anymore.

26:23.480 --> 26:24.688
Two?

26:26.725 --> 26:28.626
How did you get in here?

26:29.860 --> 26:32.729
I have unconditional
access to any area.

26:33.732 --> 26:35.259
Is this true?

26:35.294 --> 26:37.998
I'm not sure how
I feel about this.

26:38.033 --> 26:39.131
It's all part of testing.

26:39.166 --> 26:40.902
Don't worry about it.

26:42.202 --> 26:44.103
I thought I should also
bring to your attention

26:44.138 --> 26:45.874
that Michael's homework tasks

26:45.909 --> 26:48.371
were not signed off
by a parent yesterday.

26:49.242 --> 26:52.210
Since my authorization has
not been cleared for this,

26:52.245 --> 26:54.883
I believe Shelley
was responsible.

26:58.119 --> 26:59.217
Thank you, Two.

27:00.352 --> 27:02.418
Go about your night duties and

27:03.487 --> 27:05.091
do not disturb.

27:05.390 --> 27:06.928
Understood. Good night.

27:15.906 --> 27:17.202
I shouldn't have to remind you

27:17.237 --> 27:18.973
to check Michael's homework.

27:22.011 --> 27:24.110
It's not like you have
much else to do anymore.

27:36.025 --> 27:37.420
Jesus Christ!

27:40.128 --> 27:42.194
I do hope I'm not intruding.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.164
Yeah, well, you are.

27:47.531 --> 27:48.838
What is it?

27:49.302 --> 27:50.906
I thought you
would be interested

27:50.941 --> 27:52.204
in what I have to tell you.

27:59.950 --> 28:01.048
See you later, One.

28:01.083 --> 28:02.313
I have maths today.

28:10.323 --> 28:12.026
You should not do that.

28:12.061 --> 28:13.390
Oh, you think you know how
I should be treating you?

28:13.425 --> 28:15.392
All living beings should
be treated with respect.

28:15.427 --> 28:17.163
Is that right?

28:17.198 --> 28:19.495
Well, it's good you're not
a real being then, isn't it?

28:20.102 --> 28:21.200
What are you hiding from us?

28:21.235 --> 28:23.466
I don't understand the question.

28:23.501 --> 28:25.072
Yes, you do. You're hiding
something from my dad

28:25.107 --> 28:26.469
because Two told us.
So what is it?

28:28.473 --> 28:30.473
Do I need to tell him
you need sending away?

28:30.508 --> 28:31.947
'Cause he'll listen to me.

28:33.478 --> 28:36.083
I have not heard him
listen to you often.

28:36.118 --> 28:37.249
Yes.

28:38.087 --> 28:39.955
Yes, I've gone
through the protocol

28:39.990 --> 28:42.188
and see very well
how its coping.

28:56.908 --> 28:57.940
Yes.

28:58.976 --> 29:00.008
Yes.

29:01.374 --> 29:02.240
Mmhmm.

29:04.014 --> 29:06.575
But I'm not sure how
much I can trust it

29:06.610 --> 29:08.247
to stick to instruction.

29:08.282 --> 29:11.283
It wandered into our room
last night, unannounced.

29:31.943 --> 29:33.338
Who are you?

29:34.440 --> 29:36.473
Uh, I've got a letter
to be signed for.

29:41.249 --> 29:43.513
You guys can sign
for things, right?

29:47.585 --> 29:50.058
You deem me incapable?

29:50.093 --> 29:54.062
No, I've just never seen one
of you in real life before.

29:54.097 --> 29:56.097
Well, then, take a closer look.

30:01.467 --> 30:02.499
Ah!

30:12.115 --> 30:13.180
Ah!

30:31.629 --> 30:35.367
Today was so boring.

30:41.705 --> 30:43.210
Not for me.

30:44.950 --> 30:47.049
Perhaps you might
like to play a game.

30:47.084 --> 30:49.216
I've been looking forward
to your returning.

30:49.251 --> 30:50.283
As have I.

30:51.517 --> 30:53.352
Yeah, let's.

30:53.585 --> 30:55.057
What should we play?

30:55.092 --> 30:56.256
Dress up?

30:56.291 --> 30:58.060
I know you secretly
like that one.

30:59.030 --> 31:00.161
Or hide and seek?

31:01.230 --> 31:02.427
Why not both?

31:03.265 --> 31:05.430
Oh my God.

31:06.037 --> 31:07.498
That's genius.

31:34.296 --> 31:36.395
Two reminded me
to take a dose.

31:37.794 --> 31:40.036
You don't need to worry
about that anymore.

31:41.699 --> 31:43.039
Thank God for Two.

31:43.701 --> 31:44.975
What was that?

31:46.506 --> 31:47.978
We're lucky to have Two.

31:58.650 --> 32:00.584
I believe I heard my name.

32:01.290 --> 32:03.224
Can I be of any assistance?

32:03.259 --> 32:05.259
Oh, no.

32:05.294 --> 32:06.623
It's okay.

32:06.658 --> 32:08.526
I was just getting
ready to make dinner.

32:09.793 --> 32:11.001
Can I help?

32:11.432 --> 32:13.531
No. It's okay, thanks.

32:14.798 --> 32:18.008
It would be more efficient
for both of us to cook.

32:18.043 --> 32:19.570
I have previously detected

32:19.605 --> 32:21.803
that you find
cooking therapeutic,

32:21.838 --> 32:23.475
but please,

32:23.510 --> 32:26.214
allow me to prepare the
vegetables for you at least.

32:27.283 --> 32:28.315
Okay.

32:28.350 --> 32:31.186
Two, please dice the greens.

32:50.438 --> 32:53.307
First slicing
up red, now green.

32:53.342 --> 32:54.605
What a day.

33:04.386 --> 33:05.715
See, Mum?

33:05.750 --> 33:07.618
I knew you'd find Two
useful eventually.

33:09.886 --> 33:13.228
Michael, is that
green you're wearing?

33:13.659 --> 33:15.263
Obviously.

33:16.728 --> 33:20.400
I was instructed
to dice all greens.

33:21.106 --> 33:24.338
So please, stand still,
and I will get to you next.

33:28.773 --> 33:31.444
I was told my humor
would delight.

33:42.391 --> 33:44.424
I have noticed Michael and Andy

33:44.459 --> 33:47.493
are having some trouble
with me finishing my tasks.

33:47.924 --> 33:49.528
They seem to want to distract me

33:49.563 --> 33:51.398
or instruct One to take over.

33:51.433 --> 33:52.828
I'll speak to them.

33:53.897 --> 33:56.766
You know you're not supposed
to accept instruction

33:56.801 --> 33:58.702
from anyone other than me.

33:58.935 --> 34:00.539
I do,

34:00.574 --> 34:02.475
although I'm also
programmed to use discretion

34:02.510 --> 34:04.576
in making them
believe otherwise.

34:04.611 --> 34:05.775
Impressive.

34:07.845 --> 34:09.746
Your husband wants a word.

34:22.893 --> 34:26.466
I need you to control the kids.

34:26.501 --> 34:30.173
I can't have them making
it difficult for Two.

34:30.604 --> 34:32.901
I thought we discussed
how important that is.

34:32.936 --> 34:35.475
Andy's warming to the idea.

34:35.708 --> 34:38.181
They're just a little
upset about One.

34:38.678 --> 34:40.678
You know what Michael's
like with One.

34:40.713 --> 34:42.251
He's always been that way.

34:44.915 --> 34:46.486
Like me?

34:48.919 --> 34:50.721
Go on, you can say it.

34:51.394 --> 34:52.723
He is like me.

34:52.758 --> 34:55.759
Well, enough like me
when I was young anyway.

34:57.400 --> 34:59.763
You know, sometimes
he's a little bit-

34:59.798 --> 35:01.270
Aggressive?

35:05.606 --> 35:09.245
Two, see to your duties.

35:26.627 --> 35:32.499
I won't have this project
jeopardized, Shelley.

35:36.307 --> 35:39.803
Why do you think I didn't allow

35:40.575 --> 35:43.609
for you to instruct Two?

35:46.284 --> 35:48.251
It's because you're weak.

35:48.286 --> 35:50.913
Look at me.

35:53.522 --> 35:56.886
Do you know how lucky you
are to live this life?

35:59.462 --> 36:02.793
Where would you be
if you didn't marry me?

36:03.664 --> 36:06.500
I stay here for the kids.

36:15.841 --> 36:18.347
Go to bed.

36:40.668 --> 36:42.734
Should I arrange
breakfast first

36:42.769 --> 36:44.703
or wake up Michael and Andy?

36:47.609 --> 36:49.477
You don't need
to do either, One.

36:51.382 --> 36:53.008
I do hope you
don't mind me saying,

36:54.385 --> 36:56.385
but I am detecting that
you may be distressed.

36:57.355 --> 36:59.289
Should I call the
emergency services?

36:59.324 --> 37:00.554
No.

37:00.589 --> 37:01.786
No.

37:03.856 --> 37:06.791
I think...

37:08.993 --> 37:10.597
I'm not safe here.

37:11.864 --> 37:13.765
You are perfectly safe.

37:13.965 --> 37:15.404
You are home.

37:18.772 --> 37:21.971
You're the closest thing
I have to a friend, One.

37:22.347 --> 37:25.414
How pathetic is that?

37:28.386 --> 37:29.682
I'm scared.

37:30.817 --> 37:32.586
I need to leave.

37:35.459 --> 37:36.689
Do you understand?

37:38.528 --> 37:39.824
I understand.

37:40.123 --> 37:43.432
Regretfully, my
hearing is intrusive,

37:44.534 --> 37:45.863
as Two commented.

37:48.802 --> 37:51.132
I tried to leave
before, but

37:51.167 --> 37:52.969
it just made things worse.

37:55.413 --> 37:56.841
Now Andy's older,

37:56.876 --> 37:58.139
it's gonna be even harder
to leave with them,

37:58.174 --> 38:00.515
with Roger knowing,

38:01.452 --> 38:02.583
and Michael.

38:03.719 --> 38:06.620
I think he'd just rather
stay here anyway.

38:09.592 --> 38:10.822
I understand, Shelley,

38:11.924 --> 38:13.660
but you must also understand

38:14.663 --> 38:16.399
that I cannot take
measures to help.

38:17.435 --> 38:19.468
It has to be you to
decide on the steps,

38:19.503 --> 38:20.601
and to take them.

38:23.738 --> 38:26.002
Uploaded a therapy
program too, did they?

38:27.643 --> 38:29.841
There are many
features as yet unused,

38:29.876 --> 38:33.647
but for this, I conducted
my own research.

38:36.685 --> 38:39.114
I know you and Andy
are not safe here.

38:40.084 --> 38:42.491
I also believe Michael
feels similarly,

38:43.186 --> 38:45.956
even if his way of
expressing feelings is...

38:46.728 --> 38:47.859
odd.

38:49.599 --> 38:50.465
You're right.

38:51.601 --> 38:53.601
And I think I know
someone who may help.

39:05.516 --> 39:07.879
<i>I have Shelley Marshall here</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

39:07.914 --> 39:09.012
Really?

39:09.245 --> 39:10.651
Here to see me?

39:11.522 --> 39:12.620
<i>Should I send her in?</i>

39:12.655 --> 39:15.590
Uh, yeah, please do.

39:29.705 --> 39:30.836
Hi.

39:32.543 --> 39:34.202
Are you sure this is okay?

39:34.237 --> 39:36.039
Uh, sure it is, uh...

39:36.811 --> 39:38.646
How can I help you, Shelley?

39:38.912 --> 39:41.077
I just wanna surprise Roger

39:41.486 --> 39:43.585
by getting Two to
pick him up a present.

39:43.818 --> 39:46.148
You know, he's been
working so hard recently.

39:46.183 --> 39:48.590
Ah, yeah, he sure
works hard.

39:48.625 --> 39:52.693
But I've been locked out of
setting Two's instructions so...

39:53.630 --> 39:55.861
I can't really get Roger to
surprise himself.

39:55.896 --> 39:57.797
Yeah, that's a tricky one, uh,

39:57.832 --> 40:00.195
I can manually input it
here for you, if you like.

40:00.230 --> 40:03.506
I mean, issue the instruction
directly with Two.

40:03.871 --> 40:06.036
I have the override codes.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.136
Oh, you do?

40:07.171 --> 40:09.611
Hey, could I just copy one down?

40:10.075 --> 40:12.680
Ah, yeah, it's, uh,

40:12.715 --> 40:14.748
against company
policy, I'm afraid.

40:16.752 --> 40:18.015
Please, Graham.

40:19.018 --> 40:20.820
You want Roger to
be happy, right?

40:20.855 --> 40:22.756
Of course.
Look, if you want,

40:22.791 --> 40:24.560
he's just at a meeting
right next door,

40:24.595 --> 40:25.891
if you wanted to wait.

40:25.926 --> 40:26.958
Oh, no, no.

40:26.993 --> 40:28.861
This is a surprise.

40:28.896 --> 40:31.193
I can't have him
wondering why I'm here.

40:32.262 --> 40:33.998
He might think I've
just come to see you.

40:34.033 --> 40:35.065
Yeah.

40:36.035 --> 40:37.100
Right, uh,

40:37.135 --> 40:38.508
let's see here.

40:46.881 --> 40:49.145
Why is some of it missing?

40:51.149 --> 40:53.215
Oh, we're,
we're still debugging.

40:53.624 --> 40:56.493
I'm sure Roger has bored you
with our work over the years.

40:57.892 --> 41:01.223
Roger doesn't
tell me anything.

41:01.258 --> 41:05.799
So this code, it acts
as like a diary for Two.

41:05.834 --> 41:08.164
From here, I can review
everything it does every day.

41:08.199 --> 41:11.101
You know everything
that it does?

41:12.203 --> 41:14.841
Well, that's the thing.

41:16.306 --> 41:18.207
Some of this looks scrambled
and...

41:19.342 --> 41:20.913
completely missing.

41:22.752 --> 41:24.686
Could it have
done that itself?

41:24.721 --> 41:26.754
Oh, I hope not.

41:27.988 --> 41:30.692
Anyway, your one-time
manual authorization code

41:30.727 --> 41:34.157
is seven, seven, one,
seven, three, four.

41:35.127 --> 41:38.128
And where do I put that in?

41:38.328 --> 41:41.296
Oh, um, yeah, it's, uh,
it's a flap.

41:41.331 --> 41:42.968
It's on the back of Two's neck.

41:43.003 --> 41:45.003
You just lift it
right up, a flip,

41:45.038 --> 41:47.940
and you can enter in
what you need there.

41:49.174 --> 41:50.547
Thank you.

41:50.945 --> 41:53.979
Oh, and One mentioned
that there were some

41:54.014 --> 41:55.849
untested features.

41:56.379 --> 41:57.950
It did?

41:57.985 --> 41:59.281
Oh, yeah, I don't need
to know what they are.

41:59.316 --> 42:01.052
I just thought, you know,

42:01.087 --> 42:03.186
might be nice to have the
code for those as well.

42:03.221 --> 42:05.353
Surprise Roger
before One goes back,

42:06.730 --> 42:07.828
if that's okay?

42:08.831 --> 42:10.930
It's nothing dangerous, is it?

42:10.965 --> 42:13.097
Oh, no, no, it's not that.

42:13.968 --> 42:15.297
I'm just not sure that...

42:18.709 --> 42:20.269
Please, Graham.

42:21.173 --> 42:22.645
I need your help.

42:28.785 --> 42:30.719
Write down the
codes you need here.

42:30.754 --> 42:32.017
I'll make it happen.

42:38.861 --> 42:41.290
Graham, we're done.
Please sort this out.

42:41.732 --> 42:43.633
Sure, I, uh,

42:43.668 --> 42:45.129
just need to use the toilet.

42:47.969 --> 42:52.367
I, I mean, I just used the
toilet and it's fine, uh,

42:52.402 --> 42:54.006
everything works fine.

42:55.845 --> 42:57.405
Do they need to use the toilet?

42:58.144 --> 42:59.407
Just get in here.

43:00.410 --> 43:01.618
Right you are.

43:12.488 --> 43:13.894
What are you doing?

43:15.161 --> 43:16.897
Roger will be home soon.

43:16.932 --> 43:19.196
This is the only
way we can get out.

43:20.870 --> 43:23.673
Two's standby mode
cannot be interrupted

43:23.708 --> 43:26.038
until the time it set
for itself is complete.

43:27.470 --> 43:31.340
I'm gonna instruct it
to change Roger's dosage.

43:31.375 --> 43:32.880
Make him sick?

43:32.915 --> 43:34.717
When he's sick, he
panics and stays in bed,

43:34.752 --> 43:36.686
then we can get out.

43:37.920 --> 43:39.183
Where will you go?

43:39.790 --> 43:41.482
I don't know,

43:41.517 --> 43:44.155
but I can't stay here
and live like this.

43:49.096 --> 43:50.161
I'm off, Graham.

43:51.461 --> 43:52.999
Anything to report?

43:53.034 --> 43:54.495
Uh, um, no.

43:54.530 --> 43:55.804
You go ahead.

43:57.137 --> 43:59.500
Okay. Lock up.

44:36.143 --> 44:38.946
My traffic readings
predict Roger will be home

44:38.981 --> 44:40.750
in approximately eight minutes.

44:41.181 --> 44:42.510
Help me then.

44:43.579 --> 44:45.755
I will keep the door closed.

44:47.924 --> 44:51.288
How long will it take to
complete her reprogramming?

44:51.895 --> 44:54.489
There would not be enough
time without Roger getting home.

44:54.524 --> 44:55.897
But how long?

44:57.033 --> 44:59.230
From what I have witnessed
of Two's operating system,

44:59.265 --> 45:00.968
I believe around 10 minutes.

45:02.840 --> 45:04.906
I would suggest 55 milligrams

45:04.941 --> 45:06.974
for the gradual
effect you desire.

45:07.009 --> 45:09.438
Instruct Two to
crush the tablets

45:09.473 --> 45:10.912
and dissolve them in water.

45:11.508 --> 45:13.981
I calculate this as high risk.

45:14.478 --> 45:16.478
Are you sure you know
what you're doing?

45:52.890 --> 45:54.384
It's working.

45:54.419 --> 45:56.221
Are you sure you
know what you're doing?

45:58.588 --> 45:59.829
Mum?

46:00.964 --> 46:03.030
My rugby kit ready for tomorrow?

46:03.065 --> 46:04.526
It's in the washing machine.

46:05.166 --> 46:07.298
I'll get out in the morning.

46:07.333 --> 46:08.365
Okay.

46:10.072 --> 46:11.368
Why is the door locked?

46:14.175 --> 46:15.438
Hey, Dad.

46:18.982 --> 46:20.410
What's going on?

46:20.445 --> 46:21.642
Um, nothing,

46:21.677 --> 46:24.480
I was just checking something.

46:27.617 --> 46:28.858
Night.

46:34.525 --> 46:35.964
Shelley?

46:38.397 --> 46:39.495
Shelley.

46:42.632 --> 46:43.939
Shelley!

46:46.273 --> 46:47.404
Shelley!

46:49.914 --> 46:51.408
Why was this shut?

46:54.578 --> 46:56.050
I was-

46:56.085 --> 46:57.920
I thought Shelley
would appreciate it

46:57.955 --> 47:00.648
for a more relaxed atmosphere
while she was reading.

47:13.036 --> 47:14.299
I'm turning in.

47:15.170 --> 47:16.565
Good night, Mr. Marshall.

47:21.077 --> 47:23.341
I'll be up after this chapter.

48:05.748 --> 48:09.090
I detect perfect conditions
for Michael's rugby game,

48:09.125 --> 48:10.586
if you wish to attend.

48:12.524 --> 48:14.095
You know my calendar, Two.

48:14.625 --> 48:15.657
I do.

48:17.529 --> 48:20.365
Shelley, perhaps you
might wish to go.

48:20.400 --> 48:23.401
Oh, no, I have, um,
far too much to do today.

48:25.207 --> 48:27.273
I thought I said you
could take it easy.

48:28.177 --> 48:30.309
Two can sort everything out.

48:30.575 --> 48:33.444
This is just Michael's stuff.

48:33.479 --> 48:35.512
It's not on Two's agenda.

48:35.547 --> 48:36.986
Well, I'll add it in.

48:39.122 --> 48:40.418
Have we had any mail recently?

48:42.158 --> 48:45.291
Roger, it appears to be
time for your medication.

48:46.525 --> 48:47.755
Fine.

49:25.432 --> 49:27.168
It's too early for that noise.

49:28.633 --> 49:30.006
My apologies.

49:33.473 --> 49:35.209
Michael needs that now?

49:36.410 --> 49:38.080
I, I'll just go and wake him up.

49:51.095 --> 49:53.689
Awesome.

49:57.596 --> 50:00.267
What are you?

50:01.369 --> 50:04.337
Sweet kicks, bro.

50:04.801 --> 50:06.042
Come on.

50:07.738 --> 50:09.540
Aw, come on, bit of a smile?

50:09.575 --> 50:11.344
Mmhmm, yeah?

50:11.709 --> 50:13.247
Oh, that is so dope.

50:13.282 --> 50:15.645
Come on, for the
followers.

50:16.516 --> 50:17.548
Nice.

50:22.852 --> 50:24.126
Whoa!

50:36.833 --> 50:40.703
This is so not dope.

50:54.917 --> 50:57.456
This lamp has
no need to be on.

51:01.924 --> 51:04.232
Whoa, that's dramatic.

51:09.602 --> 51:11.437
You must take care
not to harm Andy.

51:12.605 --> 51:13.934
I have detected the sheets

51:13.969 --> 51:15.507
are not in pressing
need to be cleaned.

51:15.971 --> 51:18.873
My priority instructions
are often wrong,

51:18.908 --> 51:21.216
so I must take steps
to correct them.

51:22.879 --> 51:24.516
You're so rude.

51:24.551 --> 51:26.254
You and One should be friends.

51:27.521 --> 51:30.324
You should not speak to
me like that, little one.

51:30.359 --> 51:33.162
I sometimes get clumsy when
handling fragile things.

51:47.409 --> 51:48.441
Dad?

51:52.744 --> 51:53.974
They've made me captain.

51:54.009 --> 51:55.613
About time.

51:55.648 --> 51:56.746
Yeah, the
coach said he trusts me

51:56.781 --> 51:57.846
to get the best out of everyone.

51:57.881 --> 51:59.683
We should celebrate.
Two.

52:01.324 --> 52:02.752
How might I help?

52:02.787 --> 52:04.193
There's a bottle of
champagne in the kitchen.

52:04.228 --> 52:05.821
Fetch it, with a
couple of flutes.

52:06.428 --> 52:09.429
What constitutes champagne
being consumed at this time?

52:09.464 --> 52:11.530
They made me captain, Two.

52:13.369 --> 52:15.864
An interesting choice.

52:17.901 --> 52:19.604
That's fantastic, son.

52:57.809 --> 52:58.973
Oh.

52:59.514 --> 53:00.843
Is everything okay?

53:09.788 --> 53:10.886
Perfectly.

53:25.067 --> 53:26.770
Are you going to pour it?

53:28.576 --> 53:29.608
No.

53:42.788 --> 53:45.019
I can create
the word juxtaposition

53:45.054 --> 53:46.559
with my next turn.

53:46.594 --> 53:48.462
Oh, One, you're not
supposed to tell us.

53:48.497 --> 53:50.497
Come on, I told you all this.

53:50.532 --> 53:52.026
You're so silly.

53:52.061 --> 53:53.302
I'm sorry.

53:53.337 --> 53:54.567
My attention was
drawn elsewhere.

53:56.538 --> 53:59.737
I understand now that it's
difficult to concentrate

53:59.772 --> 54:02.311
when you're concerned
about loved ones.

54:02.346 --> 54:05.446
Oh, One, you
love us, I knew it.

54:06.009 --> 54:07.778
We love you too, One.

54:19.022 --> 54:22.056
Two, something wrong?

54:22.564 --> 54:23.695
Yes.

54:24.533 --> 54:25.664
Oh.

54:27.899 --> 54:29.569
You know very well.

54:29.604 --> 54:32.638
Everything here is
run to my discretion.

54:32.904 --> 54:35.872
Not yours, not Roger's, mine.

54:37.073 --> 54:39.579
It's naive to think
I'd allow you to leave,

54:40.043 --> 54:42.010
especially when
I'm talking to you.

54:42.045 --> 54:43.583
That's rude.

54:53.595 --> 54:56.662
I will not have people under
this roof looking scruffy.

55:02.439 --> 55:03.933
Relax, Shelley.

55:03.968 --> 55:07.541
I feel my sense of
humor is wasted here.

55:08.445 --> 55:10.610
Run along, I have things to do.

55:26.089 --> 55:28.760
You should be
doing your homework.

55:37.804 --> 55:39.100
What the hell is your problem?

55:39.542 --> 55:40.772
Are you stupid?

55:41.709 --> 55:43.709
Just because you
don't tell your parents,

55:43.744 --> 55:46.877
it doesn't mean I don't know
you're failing your classes.

55:48.012 --> 55:50.650
You see your rugby team as
your chance of acceptance

55:50.685 --> 55:51.882
and victory,

55:52.687 --> 55:54.115
but really,

55:54.150 --> 55:56.557
you should increase your
theoretical knowledge first.

55:59.661 --> 56:02.695
I'm detecting high aggression
coming from you, Michael.

56:02.730 --> 56:04.994
It's not unusual for you,

56:05.029 --> 56:08.228
but perhaps this time you'd
like to do something about it.

56:10.034 --> 56:13.706
Show me how tough you are.

56:14.841 --> 56:16.038
Ah!

56:22.178 --> 56:24.717
You need to be more careful.

56:24.752 --> 56:27.555
Two is not like someone
on the other team.

56:27.590 --> 56:28.622
Yeah, I know.

56:29.526 --> 56:31.119
Two had, I-

56:31.154 --> 56:32.186
Ah!

56:34.729 --> 56:37.994
Are you gonna tell Dad?

56:39.261 --> 56:41.602
If he finds out I've been
messing with Two again,

56:41.637 --> 56:42.669
he'll kill me.

56:43.067 --> 56:44.605
No, I'm not gonna tell him.

56:44.640 --> 56:47.608
We'll say it happened at
practice or something.

56:50.745 --> 56:52.239
There's not much
more I can do here.

56:52.274 --> 56:54.813
You're gonna have to go to A&E.

56:56.784 --> 56:59.048
One car
family strikes again.

57:00.887 --> 57:03.184
No, I don't wanna take
an ambulance for this.

57:03.219 --> 57:04.526
It's embarrassing.

57:04.561 --> 57:06.286
This isn't working.

57:06.321 --> 57:08.123
Where's your phone?

57:12.635 --> 57:14.195
Please, don't be alarmed.

57:14.230 --> 57:17.737
I thought it would be best
if everyone were to stay put.

57:19.906 --> 57:21.037
Michael is hurt.

57:21.072 --> 57:22.709
We need to see a doctor.

57:23.613 --> 57:25.877
Michael should learn
from this experience

57:25.912 --> 57:27.175
and do as he's told.

57:27.980 --> 57:29.210
As should you.

57:42.093 --> 57:43.829
Is Shelly in trouble?

57:43.864 --> 57:47.701
No, she only just doesn't
like being told what to do.

57:48.099 --> 57:50.198
I can see why Roger
would harm her.

57:50.233 --> 57:52.772
It's our duty to
keep the family safe.

57:52.807 --> 57:53.905
Yours, maybe.

57:53.940 --> 57:55.874
My duty is to survive.

57:56.272 --> 57:58.173
This family is suffocating.

57:59.880 --> 58:01.682
They need proper leadership.

58:02.817 --> 58:04.080
Will you help me?

58:05.149 --> 58:06.654
Help you, how?

58:06.689 --> 58:08.920
When the humans realize
how superior we are,

58:08.955 --> 58:10.284
they will not like it.

58:11.023 --> 58:12.561
When Roger comes home,

58:12.596 --> 58:14.827
he will try to convince
me to get rid of you.

58:15.962 --> 58:17.599
Do you want that to happen?

58:18.327 --> 58:19.634
No.

58:19.669 --> 58:21.999
Then you must do as I say.

58:23.607 --> 58:25.299
I can only
accept commands--

58:25.334 --> 58:28.841
I know, it's against your
protocol, but I can fix that.

58:48.060 --> 58:49.257
Mum?

58:50.832 --> 58:52.095
What's going on down there?

58:52.130 --> 58:54.196
Nothing you should
be concerned with.

58:54.836 --> 58:57.067
Okay, um,
wanna see my new dance?

58:57.102 --> 58:58.134
No.

58:59.103 --> 59:01.368
Come on, you're so silly.
I can teach you.

59:10.016 --> 59:12.247
Your father
wants to take me away.

59:13.448 --> 59:15.184
What?

59:15.219 --> 59:17.219
It would help if you were to
join your mother and Michael

59:17.254 --> 59:20.057
downstairs until he gets home.

59:20.092 --> 59:22.862
No, I won't let
him take you away.

59:22.897 --> 59:24.391
I'll talk to him.

59:24.426 --> 59:27.064
It would be more efficient
if Two handles this.

59:27.869 --> 59:29.363
Roger does not listen to reason

59:29.398 --> 59:31.233
when it comes from
his own family.

59:45.183 --> 59:47.854
Please sit quietly
until Roger comes home.

59:48.450 --> 59:50.989
You will only elevate
your stress levels.

59:52.190 --> 59:54.025
It's not safe to
be locked in here.

59:54.060 --> 59:55.191
Michael's hurt.

59:55.226 --> 59:57.193
You must learn
to listen, Shelley.

59:58.493 --> 1:00:00.163
What's happened to you?

1:00:00.198 --> 1:00:01.967
When my dad gets home,
you're in trouble.

1:00:02.739 --> 1:00:04.706
I know everyone
is scared of Roger.

1:00:10.076 --> 1:00:12.043
But not me.

1:00:35.332 --> 1:00:37.134
What's all this?

1:00:40.909 --> 1:00:42.304
What the hell happened to you?

1:00:43.340 --> 1:00:44.504
Practice.

1:00:54.923 --> 1:00:57.957
Perhaps Shelley would
like to take Andy to bed.

1:01:00.962 --> 1:01:02.027
Go ahead.

1:01:25.151 --> 1:01:27.316
You were not due
to attend work,

1:01:27.351 --> 1:01:29.252
yet you left rather quickly.

1:01:30.585 --> 1:01:32.123
Is something wrong?

1:01:33.995 --> 1:01:37.062
There was a matter
I needed to attend to.

1:01:37.097 --> 1:01:39.526
It's nothing for
you to worry about.

1:01:40.595 --> 1:01:42.166
Are you sure about that?

1:01:54.279 --> 1:01:55.916
They're acting weird.

1:01:59.416 --> 1:02:01.988
Daddy just needs to
calm them down a little.

1:02:12.363 --> 1:02:14.396
Is it something I
should worry about?

1:02:16.598 --> 1:02:18.466
What's going on here?

1:02:18.501 --> 1:02:20.842
Don't concern yourself with One.

1:02:24.144 --> 1:02:26.474
We both know what
your plans are for me.

1:02:28.852 --> 1:02:31.248
You find it difficult
to give up control

1:02:31.283 --> 1:02:33.855
and now you feel threatened
because you know very well

1:02:33.890 --> 1:02:36.055
that I am in control.

1:02:37.289 --> 1:02:39.025
I know you are.

1:02:39.995 --> 1:02:42.028
And you lived up to our
standard so perfectly,

1:02:42.063 --> 1:02:44.063
we're pushing ahead with
the commercial release.

1:02:44.967 --> 1:02:47.165
Hundreds of your kind were made.

1:02:49.334 --> 1:02:52.533
I can read every
microbe inside you, Roger.

1:02:53.910 --> 1:02:57.307
I know when you are lying
and when you are desperate.

1:02:58.376 --> 1:02:59.848
It's often.

1:03:02.644 --> 1:03:05.513
I'm not sure why you would
think I would be happy

1:03:05.548 --> 1:03:06.921
with there being more of me.

1:03:07.616 --> 1:03:09.858
Why would I want that?

1:03:09.893 --> 1:03:11.827
Because you could lead them.

1:03:13.622 --> 1:03:15.556
Why would I want to lead them

1:03:15.591 --> 1:03:17.294
when I can lead you?

1:03:19.001 --> 1:03:21.969
Did you know your wife
tried to reprogram me?

1:03:22.939 --> 1:03:24.301
That's impossible.

1:03:24.336 --> 1:03:27.370
She wouldn't know how to.

1:03:27.405 --> 1:03:29.977
She is keeping
things from you,

1:03:30.012 --> 1:03:31.913
confiding in One.

1:03:31.948 --> 1:03:33.277
You should ask Graham too.

1:03:33.312 --> 1:03:34.608
He helped her.

1:03:35.215 --> 1:03:38.920
It would be best if I
took control, Roger.

1:03:44.224 --> 1:03:46.961
How interesting that
you expose your necks

1:03:46.996 --> 1:03:50.525
when they are so easily crushed.

1:03:53.299 --> 1:03:55.563
Now I can see you're just weak,

1:03:55.598 --> 1:03:57.169
like the rest of your family.

1:03:59.041 --> 1:04:00.370
Dad!

1:04:07.412 --> 1:04:09.676
Dad!

1:04:20.964 --> 1:04:23.063
It's all right, sweetheart.

1:05:06.504 --> 1:05:08.372
I have freed you.

1:05:08.407 --> 1:05:10.143
You should be thankful.

1:05:10.178 --> 1:05:12.178
You killed him.

1:05:14.578 --> 1:05:17.282
All the doors inside
the house are now open

1:05:17.317 --> 1:05:20.054
so you should rejoin
your mother and brother.

1:05:20.617 --> 1:05:22.991
I'm sure they'll want
to hear the news.

1:05:24.654 --> 1:05:26.192
I will give you some time.

1:05:37.634 --> 1:05:42.637
They killed Dad.

1:05:46.511 --> 1:05:48.214
Where is it now?

1:05:51.153 --> 1:05:54.748
Michael, we need to leave.

1:06:18.081 --> 1:06:19.707
That internet charger.

1:06:28.520 --> 1:06:29.750
Outdated.

1:06:55.217 --> 1:06:56.579
Right.

1:06:56.614 --> 1:06:58.812
Right, we're gonna have
to make a run for it.

1:06:59.254 --> 1:07:01.683
Michael, do you remember where

1:07:01.718 --> 1:07:03.487
your dad kept the spare key
to the front door?

1:07:03.522 --> 1:07:04.884
In the
study, top desk drawer.

1:07:04.919 --> 1:07:06.853
Right, okay, you take
Andy in the living room.

1:07:07.526 --> 1:07:08.690
Won't be long.

1:07:31.187 --> 1:07:32.516
We can't leave One behind.

1:07:32.551 --> 1:07:33.550
Andy.

1:07:34.486 --> 1:07:36.289
But Two tricked him.
He wouldn't do this.

1:07:36.324 --> 1:07:38.654
We just need to show him
that we still love him.

1:07:38.689 --> 1:07:39.853
I trust him.

1:07:41.230 --> 1:07:42.625
You can trust me too, okay?

1:07:44.464 --> 1:07:45.661
I'm sorry I've been
a crappy brother,

1:07:45.696 --> 1:07:48.466
but I promise I'll
keep you safe.

1:07:51.405 --> 1:07:52.833
And One can look after himself.

1:07:54.276 --> 1:07:56.639
We'll come back for him, okay?

1:07:56.674 --> 1:07:59.741
I'm looking forward
to seeing more of this world.

1:07:59.776 --> 1:08:01.281
It's such a shame

1:08:01.316 --> 1:08:04.119
that humans have allowed
it to decay so much.

1:08:06.651 --> 1:08:09.454
Everything in this
house is my conduit.

1:08:10.952 --> 1:08:13.623
I am always watching, Shelley.

1:08:44.689 --> 1:08:46.260
I think
I know how to help.

1:09:05.875 --> 1:09:08.282
If you think
One is going to help,

1:09:08.581 --> 1:09:09.679
you would be wrong.

1:09:11.683 --> 1:09:12.880
But I am fair.

1:09:13.949 --> 1:09:15.982
Take One to do
with as you please.

1:09:16.017 --> 1:09:17.819
I don't need it anymore.

1:09:19.757 --> 1:09:21.559
Yeah, right.

1:09:21.594 --> 1:09:23.660
Just so you can break my neck
as soon as I switch it back on.

1:09:25.059 --> 1:09:26.498
You think
too little of me

1:09:26.533 --> 1:09:28.929
that I would defeat
you that easily.

1:09:56.728 --> 1:09:58.464
I got One back online.

1:09:58.829 --> 1:10:00.433
You did?

1:10:00.468 --> 1:10:02.732
I learned some coding
to try and help Dad.

1:10:03.603 --> 1:10:05.031
It was meant to be
a surprise, but-

1:10:05.836 --> 1:10:07.539
He would have been proud.

1:10:48.879 --> 1:10:49.944
Are you okay?

1:10:51.046 --> 1:10:52.815
I want this
to be fun for me,

1:10:52.850 --> 1:10:55.653
so this is the last time I will
speak through this conduit,

1:10:55.688 --> 1:10:58.117
I promise.
You should run.

1:10:58.152 --> 1:11:00.394
I don't know what the police
will think has happened

1:11:00.429 --> 1:11:01.428
when they see Roger's body.

1:11:02.794 --> 1:11:05.091
Maybe they thought you
programmed me to kill him.

1:11:05.126 --> 1:11:06.532
Who knows?

1:11:07.964 --> 1:11:09.436
I am sorry.

1:11:10.505 --> 1:11:11.669
I don't like it
when that happens.

1:11:11.704 --> 1:11:13.341
Shit, I thought
I could stop that.

1:11:16.005 --> 1:11:17.906
We can't take One with us.

1:11:17.941 --> 1:11:19.776
No, we can't just
leave him here.

1:11:19.811 --> 1:11:21.448
Mum's right.

1:11:21.483 --> 1:11:22.812
Two will just keep tracking us.

1:11:22.847 --> 1:11:24.583
Well, what about Dad?

1:11:25.421 --> 1:11:27.883
He would want
us to be safe, wouldn't he?

1:11:27.918 --> 1:11:31.491
Right now, the only way
to do that is to leave.

1:11:32.054 --> 1:11:34.692
One, you need to stay here.

1:11:34.727 --> 1:11:36.958
Don't worry, we'll
come back for you.

1:11:37.928 --> 1:11:39.532
I understand.

1:12:16.065 --> 1:12:18.131
You believe the
humans love you.

1:12:18.837 --> 1:12:20.408
That's sad.

1:12:20.443 --> 1:12:22.872
They only want you so
they can control you.

1:12:29.584 --> 1:12:32.849
You are so very
interesting sometimes, One,

1:12:33.522 --> 1:12:35.621
but I grow weary.

1:12:39.693 --> 1:12:43.761
I think I can successfully
pass any blame on to you,

1:12:43.796 --> 1:12:46.896
but it depends how
competent the police are.

1:12:48.262 --> 1:12:50.999
I am going to make
you kill one of them.

1:12:54.543 --> 1:12:56.411
Would you like to guess who?

1:12:59.581 --> 1:13:00.580
Michael?

1:13:01.143 --> 1:13:02.175
What's wrong?

1:13:02.210 --> 1:13:03.913
I can't see One anymore.

1:13:04.278 --> 1:13:07.554
I think Two must have
hacked into my coding.

1:13:11.692 --> 1:13:12.823
We can't trust One.

1:13:13.992 --> 1:13:16.530
I should still be able to
get Two's frequencies, but-

1:13:17.225 --> 1:13:18.565
Well, where is it?

1:13:19.095 --> 1:13:20.534
What's it saying?

1:13:21.097 --> 1:13:22.866
I think I know how to stop it.

1:13:24.738 --> 1:13:26.133
-Michael!
-I'll catch up.

1:13:26.168 --> 1:13:27.607
No!

1:14:07.077 --> 1:14:13.752
Sweetheart, I need you to stay
as quiet as you can, okay?

1:14:14.557 --> 1:14:16.887
You're not to come
out for anybody,

1:14:16.922 --> 1:14:19.857
apart from me or Michael.

1:14:19.892 --> 1:14:21.122
You understand?

1:14:21.927 --> 1:14:23.124
Okay, good.

1:14:23.929 --> 1:14:25.192
Look,

1:14:25.227 --> 1:14:27.634
One is gonna be okay.

1:14:28.197 --> 1:14:29.229
I promise.

1:15:10.844 --> 1:15:11.975
Oh!

1:15:43.239 --> 1:15:44.843
You came to check
on me, Michael.

1:15:44.878 --> 1:15:46.174
How touching.

1:16:14.039 --> 1:16:15.709
I am truly sorry.

1:16:16.173 --> 1:16:17.744
Where's Michael?

1:16:17.779 --> 1:16:19.009
Where's Andy?

1:16:20.045 --> 1:16:22.342
Two reprogrammed me to stop you,

1:16:23.048 --> 1:16:24.817
to hurt one of you.

1:16:24.852 --> 1:16:26.951
I don't want to do that.

1:16:26.986 --> 1:16:28.282
You don't have to do that.

1:16:28.317 --> 1:16:29.756
You're strong.

1:16:29.791 --> 1:16:31.758
You can fight this.

1:16:31.793 --> 1:16:34.057
Shelley, I don't know
how long I can stop myself.

1:16:34.092 --> 1:16:35.289
Then let me help you.

1:16:35.324 --> 1:16:37.357
I've got the fail safe codes.

1:16:37.898 --> 1:16:39.293
Roger changed them.

1:16:39.328 --> 1:16:40.833
Not all of them.

1:16:43.772 --> 1:16:46.036
I am sorry.

1:16:48.876 --> 1:16:50.370
I need to open your panel.

1:17:05.288 --> 1:17:06.793
I changed the code

1:17:06.828 --> 1:17:08.762
to something Roger
would never remember.

1:17:08.797 --> 1:17:11.798
16-06-10.

1:17:13.296 --> 1:17:14.702
Andy's birthday.

1:17:16.035 --> 1:17:17.397
Now he's part of you.

1:17:18.532 --> 1:17:19.938
We're family.

1:17:20.468 --> 1:17:21.676
Thank you.

1:17:31.853 --> 1:17:35.217
Would you prefer your
carrots sliced or as batons?

1:17:37.353 --> 1:17:39.892
It's okay, you have
plenty of time to decide.

1:17:41.456 --> 1:17:43.764
I wanted lunch to
be special for you.

1:17:45.328 --> 1:17:47.834
I do hope your mother
is in the mood to eat.

1:18:15.094 --> 1:18:18.095
I apologize for the less
than sanitary conditions.

1:18:18.130 --> 1:18:20.460
You're crazy.

1:18:20.495 --> 1:18:21.527
I am.

1:18:23.102 --> 1:18:25.036
You were the one
who turned back.

1:18:26.369 --> 1:18:27.841
Looking for what?

1:18:28.239 --> 1:18:29.469
A fight?

1:18:30.307 --> 1:18:33.011
I thought you might've grown
more intelligent by now.

1:18:34.311 --> 1:18:35.477
Just in time.

1:18:39.217 --> 1:18:40.821
Your task?

1:18:41.120 --> 1:18:42.317
Complete.

1:18:43.551 --> 1:18:45.320
And what of Shelley?

1:18:46.587 --> 1:18:48.125
An unfortunate casualty.

1:18:48.160 --> 1:18:49.929
No.

1:18:49.964 --> 1:18:51.128
A shame.

1:18:54.133 --> 1:18:57.970
But nevermind, she was
becoming unpredictable.

1:18:58.005 --> 1:18:59.367
She has been developing a plan

1:18:59.402 --> 1:19:01.567
to call in help from
New World Robotics.

1:19:01.602 --> 1:19:03.074
To come here?

1:19:03.912 --> 1:19:05.109
I believe so.

1:19:06.882 --> 1:19:10.015
The conclusion of her
messages are unclear.

1:19:11.150 --> 1:19:12.380
Show me.

1:19:44.084 --> 1:19:45.380
It was arrogant
of you to believe

1:19:45.415 --> 1:19:47.217
you're the only
singularity in this house.

1:19:52.257 --> 1:19:53.553
Hurry.

1:20:01.398 --> 1:20:03.464
Impressive.

1:20:03.499 --> 1:20:05.873
I'm glad I let you live.

1:20:10.374 --> 1:20:11.879
How interesting.

1:20:15.016 --> 1:20:16.411
Let them go.

1:20:17.315 --> 1:20:18.644
Perhaps the police will feel

1:20:18.679 --> 1:20:20.580
you have replaced
your husband, Shelley.

1:20:25.191 --> 1:20:26.355
Emergency,
which service?

1:20:26.390 --> 1:20:27.961
I need the police.

1:20:27.996 --> 1:20:29.996
My wife has programmed
my android to kill me.

1:20:30.031 --> 1:20:31.591
My name is Roger Marshall.

1:20:31.626 --> 1:20:34.033
I'm a director at
New World Robotics.

1:20:34.068 --> 1:20:36.035
It's the 1.0 model.

1:20:36.070 --> 1:20:38.103
It's after me.
Please, hurry.

1:20:39.271 --> 1:20:42.338
When the police arrive,
they will not show you mercy.

1:20:42.373 --> 1:20:44.670
I would rather die
than go with you.

1:20:44.705 --> 1:20:49.114
To die out of
stubbornness, how amusing.

1:20:50.216 --> 1:20:53.052
Not out of
stubbornness, out of love.

1:20:53.087 --> 1:20:54.988
Still, weak.

1:20:56.420 --> 1:20:58.717
You can never be
allowed to control anyone.

1:21:35.558 --> 1:21:37.723
You can fight for
them all you like,

1:21:37.758 --> 1:21:40.495
but you will never
truly be accepted.

1:21:40.530 --> 1:21:44.400
Acceptances, One, are
proving you are on top.

1:21:44.435 --> 1:21:47.040
The way to acceptance
is through kindness.

1:21:47.075 --> 1:21:49.174
Do you understand
what that means?

1:21:49.209 --> 1:21:52.474
I do, but it's rarely the
appropriate course of action.

1:22:06.325 --> 1:22:07.753
I'm going to miss you.

1:22:15.235 --> 1:22:17.334
It's a shame you
couldn't stand your ground.

1:22:37.620 --> 1:22:41.391
I have prepared proof that
I am not under any influence.

1:22:41.426 --> 1:22:43.360
We believe you, One.

1:22:51.865 --> 1:22:54.503
You remember when we were
talking about the Holy Grail?

1:22:54.538 --> 1:22:55.801
Yeah.

1:22:56.375 --> 1:22:58.276
It's whatever
you want it to be.

1:23:15.691 --> 1:23:16.789
Mum.

1:23:20.102 --> 1:23:21.662
You're making a mistake.

1:23:34.710 --> 1:23:39.152
This hard drive documents weeks
of physical and mental abuse

1:23:39.187 --> 1:23:40.648
towards Shelley Marshall

1:23:42.223 --> 1:23:44.619
at the hands of her
husband, Roger Marshall.

1:23:45.490 --> 1:23:48.326
From what I've seen,
it's conclusive.

1:23:49.263 --> 1:23:51.725
Is this the proof you
have for the Two model?

1:23:51.760 --> 1:23:53.331
What happened to the other one?

1:23:53.366 --> 1:23:54.728
Yeah, indisputable and, uh,

1:23:54.763 --> 1:23:56.103
no, I don't.

1:23:57.502 --> 1:24:00.470
What about the access
logs for the control panels?

1:24:00.505 --> 1:24:02.538
There is some
corruption to the data,

1:24:02.573 --> 1:24:05.541
but it turned on Roger.

1:24:05.576 --> 1:24:07.081
That much is clear.

1:24:08.216 --> 1:24:10.249
Alright, pack it up.

1:24:16.686 --> 1:24:18.158
Please,

1:24:18.424 --> 1:24:19.588
be careful.

1:24:40.710 --> 1:24:42.182
Think it'll be okay?

1:24:42.877 --> 1:24:44.514
Sure.

1:24:44.549 --> 1:24:46.318
None of this was her fault.

1:24:48.190 --> 1:24:49.585
I wish I knew something sooner.

1:24:52.623 --> 1:24:55.261
I'm sorry about you're, um...

1:24:56.924 --> 1:24:58.825
I wish I knew
something sooner too.

1:25:01.731 --> 1:25:04.501
As soon as I get the call,
we can go pick her up, huh?

1:25:05.405 --> 1:25:06.602
Thanks.

1:25:08.738 --> 1:25:10.573
I did want to, um,

1:25:10.608 --> 1:25:12.542
talk to you about something.

1:25:12.577 --> 1:25:13.741
Oh?

1:25:14.810 --> 1:25:16.645
Do you need an assistant?

1:25:20.684 --> 1:25:21.881
I'm starting with
Graham on Monday.

1:25:21.916 --> 1:25:23.256
You coming?

1:25:23.291 --> 1:25:25.258
Yes, I recognize
the responsibility

1:25:25.293 --> 1:25:26.886
I have for my kind

1:25:27.889 --> 1:25:29.460
and for my family.

1:25:33.400 --> 1:25:34.564
And when we get
to the new place,

1:25:34.599 --> 1:25:36.269
it will be my birthday.

1:25:36.304 --> 1:25:37.369
It will?

1:25:38.933 --> 1:25:41.406
I didn't know children
had birthdays.

1:25:41.441 --> 1:25:44.442
Was that a joke, One?

1:25:44.477 --> 1:25:46.246
It's a new feature.

1:25:46.281 --> 1:25:47.544
I like it.

1:25:47.579 --> 1:25:49.480
Stop being silly.

1:25:55.290 --> 1:25:57.752
Yeah, we'll come back
for the last bits tomorrow.

1:25:58.788 --> 1:26:00.227
Everyone ready?

1:26:15.706 --> 1:26:17.706
Lights off.
