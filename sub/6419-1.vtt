02:21.099 --> 02:23.142
(Chuckles) Well !

02:23.268 --> 02:25.519
Gee, it's good to see you !

02:25.645 --> 02:29.606
Hey, you'll catch your death of cold.
Go on, get in there.

02:29.732 --> 02:32.693
- Gosh, you're looking well, Ma.
- Oh, so are you, George.

02:32.819 --> 02:35.195
Well, I got a little cold, but I'm all right.

02:35.321 --> 02:38.490
I think you look better
than you did five or six months ago.

02:38.616 --> 02:40.617
You looked a little peaked then,
I thought.

02:40.743 --> 02:45.164
- I see the others got here before me.
- Yes. Your pa's waitin' for you, though.

02:45.290 --> 02:48.834
What do you mean, Ma?
Say, what is this gathering of the clan?

02:48.960 --> 02:51.670
- Well, I'd rather Pa told you.
- Hm-hm.

02:51.796 --> 02:55.465
- How's Anita and the baby?
- Oh, they're just fine.

02:55.592 --> 02:58.969
Only Rhoda isn't a baby any more.
She's thinking of going to college.

02:59.095 --> 03:01.763
Oh ! Oh, Pa, here's George.

03:01.890 --> 03:06.643
Well, there's a familiar sight,
Pa in the same old chair.

03:06.769 --> 03:09.771
- Hello, George.
- Don't get up, don't get up.

03:09.898 --> 03:12.024
Gee, it's good to see you, Pa.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.318
Gosh, I haven't seen you since...

03:14.444 --> 03:19.281
Well, it's been too long, anyway.
I don't know. We plan, we plan...

03:19.407 --> 03:22.451
- Hello, Nellie.
- Hello, George.

03:22.577 --> 03:25.746
As for you, you know,
I don't know when I saw you last.

03:25.872 --> 03:28.707
Oh, I forgot. I can't kiss you, Cora.

03:28.833 --> 03:32.502
I got a nasty little cold.
I shouldn't have kissed you either.

- Here you are, Mother.
- No, dear.

04:16.422 --> 04:18.757
That don't go
with standing over a hot stove.

04:18.882 --> 04:21.218
OK, it'll just be two for me.
How about you, George?

04:21.344 --> 04:23.136
You're still the best-looking one
in the family, Robert.

04:23.263 --> 04:26.556
Yeah? The day I was born,
Pop took one look at me and said,

04:26.683 --> 04:30.018
- "That did it. No more Coopers!"
- (Chuckling)

04:30.687 --> 04:33.313
Cora?

04:33.439 --> 04:35.649
Here you are, Nellie.

04:35.775 --> 04:39.361
- (Gasps)
- Oh ! I got somethin' on you, Nellie.

04:39.487 --> 04:41.405
- Here ya are, Pa.
- Thanks.

04:41.531 --> 04:44.992
Try that on your ulcer.
Wait a minute, now. Nobody drink.

04:45.118 --> 04:48.328
I always make it a point
to drink to somethin'.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.497
Let's see. Now, let me think.

04:50.623 --> 04:53.709
(Chuckles) Don't think too hard, Robert.
You might hurt yourself.

04:53.835 --> 04:56.295
- Oh...
- (Laughs) Why, Pa !

04:56.421 --> 04:59.423
Let's see now, uh...

04:59.549 --> 05:02.009
Here's to our house,

05:02.135 --> 05:08.724
through sunshine or showers,
be it ever so humble, by golly, it's ours.

05:08.850 --> 05:11.852
- (Chuckling) Good, huh, Pop?
- (Cora) Yeah.

05:11.978 --> 05:16.440
Ah, it's all right.
Only the last line don't make sense.

05:16.566 --> 05:18.442
- Does it, Ma?
- No.

05:18.568 --> 05:21.445
- You see, the house...
- Don't tell 'em now, Bark.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.822
- Wait till after dinner.
- What is it?

05:23.948 --> 05:27.576
Why not now?
That's why we got 'em down here.

05:27.702 --> 05:30.579
You see, the house isn't ours any more.

05:30.705 --> 05:34.082
- The bank is taking it over.
- The bank?

05:34.208 --> 05:36.918
- You mean you've lost it?
- Oh, that's awful !

05:37.045 --> 05:42.549
- Bank? Well, there's a bank for you !
- What happened, Father?

05:42.675 --> 05:47.512
Well, as you know,
I haven't been working for, uh...

05:47.638 --> 05:50.807
Well, it's almost four years now.

05:50.933 --> 05:55.312
- That's right, ain't it, Ma? Four years?
- Four years, 5th June, Pa.

05:55.438 --> 05:59.649
And with everything going out
and nothing coming in,

05:59.776 --> 06:03.111
I couldn't keep up the payments.

06:03.237 --> 06:09.159
So long as I never sent them anything,
they sent for me.

06:09.285 --> 06:12.496
The head of the bank, Randy Dunlap,

06:12.622 --> 06:15.582
asked me to drop in to his house
for a little chat.

06:15.708 --> 06:18.877
You remember him? Randy Dunlap?

06:19.003 --> 06:22.589
He used to keep company with your mother
before I cut him out.

06:22.715 --> 06:24.466
Bark!

06:24.592 --> 06:29.471
So, I dropped in
and he asked me to sit down.

06:29.597 --> 06:31.598
(Chuckling)

06:31.724 --> 06:35.977
George, do you know what he was wearing?
A kimono.

06:36.104 --> 06:37.729
- No!
- Yeah.

06:37.855 --> 06:41.233
Oh, now, Bark.
It must have been a dressing gown.

06:41.359 --> 06:44.820
I know a dressing gown when I see it.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.072
It was a kimono, George.

06:47.198 --> 06:51.493
Well, he asked me to sit down.
Then he offered me a cigar.

06:53.996 --> 06:59.167
- Do dressing gowns have...flowers on 'em?
- Oh, Bark!

07:01.796 --> 07:06.633
- Never mind that, Father. What did he say?
- Oh, he was nice enough.

07:06.759 --> 07:13.723
He put his arm around me and he said,
"Bark, I hate to have to do this to you."

07:14.767 --> 07:20.355
But deep down in his heart,
I think he was saying, "Goody."

07:20.481 --> 07:25.444
Oh, now, Bark. He did say that
we could take our time about moving out.

07:25.570 --> 07:27.112
(Bark) Yeah, he did.

07:27.238 --> 07:31.616
- How much time did he give you, Father?
- Six months.

07:31.742 --> 07:35.787
Oh ! Oh, well, then,
there's no immediate rush.

07:35.913 --> 07:38.832
When are the six months up?

07:38.958 --> 07:41.626
Tuesday.

07:41.752 --> 07:45.130
But...but why didn't you tell us sooner?

07:45.256 --> 07:50.135
Well, your father and I were hoping
that something would turn up

07:50.261 --> 07:53.472
and we wouldn't have to tell you at all.

07:53.598 --> 07:57.058
Tuesday. Doesn't give us much time, does it?

07:57.185 --> 08:03.315
Well, this house has been too big
for your mother to take care of anyway.

08:03.441 --> 08:06.109
Yeah, Father, but what I mean is,

08:06.235 --> 08:09.070
if we'd known sooner,
we could have all chipped in

08:09.197 --> 08:12.616
and found you a little place somewhere.

08:12.742 --> 08:17.579
(Chuckles) Or...I know Nellie will tell you
Harvey's business never was worse.

08:17.705 --> 08:20.332
That's right. You'd be surprised
if you knew how bad things are.

08:20.458 --> 08:24.211
Oh, sure. Who gave you that dress,
the Salvation Army?

08:24.337 --> 08:25.921
(Chuckling)

08:26.047 --> 08:28.507
And Cora will tell you
that if Bill doesn't get a job soon,

08:28.633 --> 08:30.550
she'll have to go to work herself.

08:30.676 --> 08:33.345
And, uh... Yeah.

08:33.471 --> 08:35.472
Well, I can't do it alone.

08:35.597 --> 08:40.059
And there's no point in writing to Addie,
way out there in California.

08:40.186 --> 08:42.645
No, she's never even sent us an orange.

08:42.772 --> 08:46.024
And in as much as Anita and I
are planning to send Rhoda to college,

08:46.150 --> 08:47.567
now, the only thing I can suggest

08:47.693 --> 08:50.779
is that you come to live with one of us
until we get ourselves straightened out.

08:50.905 --> 08:53.281
No, your father and I
were talking about that, and we...

08:53.407 --> 08:55.242
I know what you're thinking about, Mother,

08:55.368 --> 08:57.536
but you're more than welcome
with any one of us.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.872
Now, Nellie, after all,
there's only you and Harvey.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.958
Yes, but what about Harvey?

09:03.084 --> 09:07.128
- Oh, we wouldn't want to ask Harvey.
- Oh, no, we wouldn't ask Harvey.

09:07.255 --> 09:10.966
No, we asked Harvey to marry Nellie. We
can't expect the guy to do more than that.

09:11.092 --> 09:13.843
Father, will you make him
stop talking like that?

09:13.970 --> 09:16.388
Robert, stop talking that way.

09:16.514 --> 09:18.098
Cut it out, Robert.

09:18.224 --> 09:22.060
I haven't room for both of you. There's
only a small couch in the living room.

09:22.186 --> 09:25.605
Mother, there's an extra bed in
Rhoda's room, and she'd love to have you.

09:25.731 --> 09:29.734
If Father doesn't mind going to Cora's for a
while, why don't you come on a visit to us?

09:29.860 --> 09:35.073
Well, that's awfully nice of you, George,
but, well, your father and I thought

09:35.199 --> 09:39.160
that no matter what happened,
we'd always be t...

09:40.538 --> 09:42.706
Oh, well, never mind what we thought.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.419
Nellie, can't you and Harvey...

09:47.545 --> 09:50.922
Yes, I can.
I plan to do more than you and Cora.

09:51.048 --> 09:55.051
I can practically promise that within
three months they'll be together again.

09:55.177 --> 09:57.721
Of course,
I'll have to speak to Harvey about it.

09:57.847 --> 10:00.432
(Chuckling)
Will you put that in writing, Nellie?

10:00.558 --> 10:02.809
Well, that's more like it.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.645
Well, I...I guess everything's settled.

10:05.771 --> 10:11.860
Mother comes for a visit to us
and Father goes to Cora's for a while, hm?

10:11.986 --> 10:14.195
Well, Bark?

10:14.322 --> 10:18.283
- Maybe it'll work out all right.
- Sure.

10:18.409 --> 10:22.579
It'll be very nice
living with the children for a while.

10:22.705 --> 10:23.955
Of course.

10:24.081 --> 10:26.958
- Yeah, except...
- Except what?

10:27.084 --> 10:31.129
Except it never has worked out
for anybody else.

10:31.255 --> 10:35.925
- Father, there's nothing to worry about.
- Now, Bark, you ought not to say that.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.228
Well?

11:28.354 --> 11:30.980
- (Chuckling)
- And what are you up to?

11:31.107 --> 11:34.901
I just had a feeling that
Grandpa's picture really belonged in here.

11:35.027 --> 11:36.277
Oh, you did?

11:36.404 --> 11:40.907
Yesterday it was this old, ancient antique,
and today it's Grandpa's picture.

11:41.033 --> 11:45.203
Oh, I've got Grandma in my room,
and that's enough.

11:45.329 --> 11:49.666
I know how you love your own room, honey.
It's tough on all of us.

11:50.835 --> 11:53.753
- Even Grandma, you know.
- (Creaking)

11:53.879 --> 11:58.216
But it'll only be for three months,
and then Aunt Nellie will take her.

11:58.342 --> 12:01.344
Well, OK.

12:01.470 --> 12:04.514
I'll have Mamie take these things
back to my room.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.267
Oh, bridge class tonight?

12:07.393 --> 12:09.936
Mob of them.

12:10.062 --> 12:14.899
By the way, I haven't seen any
of your friends lately. What's the matter?

12:15.025 --> 12:19.112
Grandma. She talks an arm
off everyone I bring around.

12:19.238 --> 12:22.323
I know. I've had a taste of it.

12:22.450 --> 12:24.951
But you must bring your friends home.

12:25.077 --> 12:28.371
I won't have you going out
with boys I've never met.

12:30.374 --> 12:31.833
- Hello, everybody.
- Hello, George.

12:31.959 --> 12:35.128
- Hello, Daddy!
- Dear.

12:35.254 --> 12:38.631
Oh, you're gonna put Pa's picture in here!

12:38.758 --> 12:40.842
That's fine. Mm.

12:44.305 --> 12:46.556
Darling.

12:49.143 --> 12:52.437
Oh, say, what about Mother tonight,
with this bridge and everything?

12:52.563 --> 12:55.106
She's going to be in the way, isn't she?

12:57.818 --> 12:59.402
Wait.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.121
(Whispers) Is she asleep?

13:16.170 --> 13:18.046
Hope I don't get Harvey.

13:18.172 --> 13:21.090
Oh, hello, Harvey. Hiya, boy.

13:25.679 --> 13:28.097
Put Nellie on, will you, Harvey?

13:29.141 --> 13:31.392
Nellie.

13:31.519 --> 13:33.520
It's George.

13:37.858 --> 13:39.400
Hello, George.

13:39.527 --> 13:42.862
Oh, hello, Nellie. I...

13:42.988 --> 13:47.492
Nellie, Anita's having
her bridge class tonight.

13:47.618 --> 13:51.663
And I know Mother's going to be
bored to distraction. I thought...

13:51.789 --> 13:56.960
Oh, I...I'm so sorry, but Harvey's bought
some theatre tickets for tonight.

13:57.086 --> 13:58.586
Well, you know how it is.

13:58.712 --> 14:01.339
We have to entertain
the people he does business with,

14:01.465 --> 14:03.967
and I guess that's what it is tonight.

14:04.093 --> 14:07.512
Oh, no, no, George,
I couldn't possibly take Mother tonight.

14:07.638 --> 14:09.889
- Tell him you can't take her any time.
- Shh !

14:10.015 --> 14:13.142
What's the use of stalling?
I'm not going to have your parents here.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.270
- George, I would if I could.
- But you can't.

14:15.396 --> 14:17.230
- Will you shut up?
- You'll have to tell him sooner or later.

14:17.356 --> 14:20.441
- What, George? Just a minute, George.
- I married you. I didn't marry your folks.

14:20.568 --> 14:22.569
I didn't ask my mother to live here, did I?

14:22.695 --> 14:26.030
- (Voice cracks) Did I?
- What, George?

14:26.156 --> 14:29.784
- Oh, George, I am willing to do my part.
- No roof is big enough for two families.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.412
No, George, no,
I couldn't possibly take Mother tonight.

14:32.538 --> 14:34.706
I'm sorry. Goodbye.

14:36.542 --> 14:41.087
Satisfied? Incidentally,
who are we going out with tonight?

14:41.213 --> 14:43.548
My mother. But that's different. I...

14:44.550 --> 14:48.720
(Sighs) Hm. I was so afraid
it was someone I didn't like.

14:48.846 --> 14:51.681
Mother just won't fit in at all, will she?

14:54.143 --> 14:57.604
You don't suppose
she'd stay in her room, do you?

14:57.730 --> 15:00.523
- (Creaking)
- No.

15:00.649 --> 15:03.151
I don't see how we could...

15:04.862 --> 15:08.656
(George) Oh, hello, Mother. It's Mother.

15:08.782 --> 15:12.368
George, I never heard
such nonsense in all my life,

15:12.494 --> 15:16.581
trying to get Nellie to take me,
and talk of me staying in my room.

15:16.707 --> 15:21.377
- It's only because you'd be bored.
- (Snorts) Well, don't you worry about me.

15:21.503 --> 15:24.756
Folks'd think it was pretty funny
if I wasn't around.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.133
- They'd think you were ashamed of me.
- Ho-ho.

15:27.259 --> 15:31.387
George was only trying
to be kind to you, dear.

15:31.513 --> 15:34.557
My bridge pupils drive him mad.

15:34.683 --> 15:40.021
(Mother) I guess you won't ever
have to explain George to his mother.

15:41.440 --> 15:44.400
Oh, Pa's picture. You gonna put it in here?

15:44.526 --> 15:46.694
Aw, that's fine.

15:49.239 --> 15:53.076
Another day has gone by and no word
from him. Do you suppose he's all right?

15:53.202 --> 15:57.538
Of course he's all right.
We'd hear fast enough if he were ill.

15:57.665 --> 15:59.749
Well, I guess that's true.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.503
Is, uh...my tuxedo laid out?

16:03.629 --> 16:06.631
- Yes. I couldn't find your shirt.
- Did you send it to the laundry?

16:06.757 --> 16:08.591
- No.
- I did.

16:08.717 --> 16:11.177
- But, Mother...
- I took it to the laundry around the corner.

16:11.303 --> 16:16.724
They've got a sign in the window, "Bring
your own bundle and save 20 per cent."

16:16.850 --> 16:18.142
- Yes, but we...
- Besides, George,

16:18.268 --> 16:22.188
your shirts haven't looked
as crisp and fresh as they should.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.899
These people do lovely work.

16:25.025 --> 16:28.611
Yes, except that
I won't have a shirt for tonight.

16:28.737 --> 16:32.156
- Well, I didn't know that.
- Now look here, Mother C.

16:32.282 --> 16:34.867
- I know you like to look after George.
- Yes.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.537
- Well, so do I.
- Of course.

16:37.663 --> 16:42.750
And though I don't do much talking about it,
I like to run my house too.

16:42.876 --> 16:45.545
- Oh, well, I only wanted to help.
- Of course.

16:45.671 --> 16:48.131
And you're so busy playing bridge...

16:48.257 --> 16:51.592
I don't play bridge, I teach bridge.

16:51.719 --> 16:57.056
There's a difference that you'd notice if
you had to meet the bills of this apartment.

16:57.182 --> 17:01.894
Well, it's all very simple.
I'll just run out and buy another shirt.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.813
Mm-hm.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.944
Oh, well.

17:11.070 --> 17:13.948
I guess I'm not much help around here.

17:14.074 --> 17:15.950
Oh, Mother C!

17:17.327 --> 17:19.162
(Sighs)

17:30.007 --> 17:34.677
- I could make the sandwiches, couldn't I?
- They're coming from the delicatessen.

17:34.803 --> 17:37.972
- It's cheaper to make 'em at home.
- I know.

17:38.098 --> 17:42.226
But we couldn't do so well.
These are going to be fancy.

17:43.228 --> 17:46.355
How fancy can a sandwich be?

17:46.482 --> 17:47.899
You'll see.

17:49.068 --> 17:52.904
Any bid made subsequently
to an opponent's bid

17:53.030 --> 17:57.116
is known as an overcall or a defensive bid.

17:57.242 --> 18:02.497
An overcall may be made with
a much weaker hand than an original bid,

18:02.623 --> 18:06.542
a fact which the partner must bear in mind.

18:06.668 --> 18:12.882
As a rule, it is inadvisable to make
an overcall on two of a four-card suit...

18:15.135 --> 18:17.804
- (Sighs)
- (Rocker creaks)

18:27.106 --> 18:30.233
...or to overcall with a no-trump bid

18:30.359 --> 18:34.904
without a double-stopper in the suit
bid by the opponent.

18:40.410 --> 18:42.703
It requires more strength...

18:46.291 --> 18:49.377
I know you'll forgive me
if I interrupt myself for a moment,

18:51.171 --> 18:54.298
but I do so want you all
to meet my husband's mother.

18:54.424 --> 18:57.051
(Others) How do you do?

19:01.640 --> 19:04.267
Well, um...anyway...

19:04.393 --> 19:07.436
suppose we, um...play the hands?

19:09.231 --> 19:11.732
Uh...suppose we play them.

19:13.360 --> 19:15.319
- I'll bid one spade.
- One spade.

19:15.445 --> 19:17.947
- One spade.
- Two hearts.

19:18.073 --> 19:20.158
(Guests chattering)

19:31.170 --> 19:33.462
(Rocker creaking)

19:36.175 --> 19:38.775
(Creaking continues)

19:58.155 --> 20:00.239
(Creaking stops)

20:04.244 --> 20:06.662
(Creaks)

20:07.706 --> 20:10.333
She didn't show up, so I'm playing this.
Three spades.

20:10.459 --> 20:12.293
Do you play cards?

20:12.419 --> 20:16.005
- (Rocker creaks)
- Well, it's, uh...it's funny,

20:16.131 --> 20:20.259
but, you know, with a teacher
right here in the family,

20:20.385 --> 20:22.929
I don't believe
I could ever learn to play bridge.

20:23.055 --> 20:25.473
(Others chuckle)

20:25.599 --> 20:29.685
Well, maybe a little hearts.
I used to play a lot with my husband.

20:29.811 --> 20:34.023
I always gave him the Queen of Spades.
We called her Dirty Dora.

20:34.149 --> 20:36.025
(Laughter)

20:37.611 --> 20:39.737
Say, by the way, that's a good heart hand.

20:39.863 --> 20:42.823
(Laughs) And you haven't got Dora.
Let's see who has.

20:42.950 --> 20:45.034
(Laughing) Oh ! You !

20:48.789 --> 20:52.667
Honey, you're going to the movies
alone tonight, aren't you?

20:52.793 --> 20:54.794
- Well, aren't you?
- Uh-huh.

20:54.920 --> 20:56.170
If you love me,

20:56.296 --> 21:00.174
if I've ever done anything for you
that you appreciated even a little bit,

21:00.300 --> 21:02.551
for heaven's sake,
take your grandmother with you.

21:02.678 --> 21:07.932
Oh, that's no fair. And anyway,
she likes the company here.

21:08.058 --> 21:09.892
Well, maybe I can fix that.

21:11.103 --> 21:14.605
(Door opens and closes)

21:19.945 --> 21:22.863
Mother C, Rhoda's set on going
to the pictures tonight.

21:22.990 --> 21:24.824
Do you think it's all right
if she goes alone?

21:24.950 --> 21:27.285
- Oh, I should say not.
- That's what I thought.

21:27.411 --> 21:31.414
Would you go with her? Or would that
be too much of a responsibility?

21:31.540 --> 21:34.792
Why, anything I can do to help you,
dear, I'll be glad.

21:34.918 --> 21:37.461
What a load off my mind !
Will you tell Rhoda?

21:37.587 --> 21:40.006
- Why, certainly.
- Thank you, dear.

21:50.684 --> 21:53.477
(Upbeat orchestral music)

22:09.870 --> 22:12.470
(No audible dialogue)

22:54.956 --> 22:57.541
(Dramatic orchestral music)

23:00.253 --> 23:02.463
Can you give me a rough idea
of what the picture's about?

23:02.589 --> 23:08.803
Yeah. It's the old gag about the guy that
takes the blame for a job his pal done.

23:08.929 --> 23:12.139
The pal's a rat
and lets the nice guy go to the pen.

23:12.265 --> 23:17.186
But when he's dyin', the rat confesses
and the boy and girl wind up...

23:17.312 --> 23:21.524
- Well, is it sad in any place?
- Some of 'em cry when his dog dies.

23:21.650 --> 23:24.944
- Thanks!
- There's a newsreel and "Betty Boop".

23:26.321 --> 23:28.739
(Chuckles) Oh. There you are.

23:30.951 --> 23:34.203
- It was a good show, wasn't it?
- Yes.

23:34.329 --> 23:38.707
I liked the boy very much. Didn't you?

23:38.834 --> 23:45.339
Why, I don't know. I only caught a swift
glimpse of him as you got out of his car.

23:45.465 --> 23:47.133
As I got...

23:47.259 --> 23:49.635
Oh. You saw me.

23:49.761 --> 23:51.470
Mm.

23:51.596 --> 23:53.556
Are you gonna tell?

23:57.144 --> 23:59.019
Are you gonna do it again?

23:59.146 --> 24:01.897
Uh-uh. Are you gonna tell?

24:05.694 --> 24:07.695
No.

24:10.615 --> 24:12.408
(Chattering)

24:18.206 --> 24:20.875
- Oh, here's your mother.
- Oh ! Hello, Mother.

24:21.001 --> 24:22.501
- Hello.
- Like the picture?

24:22.627 --> 24:25.880
- Oh, it was fine.
- Uh-huh.

24:26.006 --> 24:30.384
A little sad in places,
but it had a happy ending.

24:30.510 --> 24:34.346
Uh, a young man was taking the blame
for his friend,

24:34.473 --> 24:36.932
who wasn't a very strong character.

24:37.058 --> 24:40.978
But the girl believed in the young man.
The nice young man, I mean.

24:41.104 --> 24:45.274
And you know,
no matter how black things looked...

24:45.400 --> 24:46.734
(Chuckles)

24:46.860 --> 24:51.071
I guess I shouldn't be telling you this,
'cause it might spoil the picture for you.

24:51.198 --> 24:52.615
(Others chuckling)

24:54.242 --> 24:57.953
Oh, I guess I should go to bed.
It must be after 11.

24:58.079 --> 25:01.123
- What time do you got?
- Why, I have only 10.30.

25:01.249 --> 25:03.834
Oh. Well, then, I can stay a little while.

25:07.005 --> 25:09.173
(Phone rings)

25:09.299 --> 25:11.467
(Anita) Excuse me, please.

25:14.804 --> 25:16.764
Hello.

25:16.890 --> 25:19.391
Oh, hello, Father C. Just a minute.

25:19.518 --> 25:22.978
I forgot. He called while you were out.

25:28.360 --> 25:31.695
(Loud) Hello? Is that you, Bark?

25:31.821 --> 25:34.198
This is Lucy, Bark!

25:34.324 --> 25:37.701
How are ya? I say, how are ya?

25:37.827 --> 25:42.039
Well, I was worried about you.
Why didn't you write?

25:42.165 --> 25:44.500
You ought to write. You know I worry.

25:45.961 --> 25:49.088
Oh, I'm fine.

25:49.214 --> 25:52.800
I got some friends in tonight, playing cards.

25:52.926 --> 25:55.094
Oh, some lovely people, Bark.

25:56.471 --> 25:58.722
How's Cora?

25:58.848 --> 26:00.683
How are the children?

26:00.809 --> 26:03.143
Really? Well, how's Bill?

26:04.437 --> 26:07.731
Well, how are you, Bark?
You know what I mean.

26:07.857 --> 26:09.650
How is everything?

26:10.902 --> 26:13.070
Oh, of course, of course.

26:13.196 --> 26:15.739
But three months isn't so long, Bark.

26:16.950 --> 26:20.578
Bark, it's getting cool now.
Don't go out without your coat.

26:20.704 --> 26:23.247
And if it rains, don't go out at all.

26:25.208 --> 26:27.751
Oh, I'm...I'm happy as a lark.

26:28.503 --> 26:32.339
Course, I...I miss you, Bark.
That's the only trouble.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.384
I know you do.

26:35.510 --> 26:41.348
Uh...don't forget what I told ya.
We'll soon be together for always.

26:43.143 --> 26:47.479
And you won't worry, will ya?
And please take care of yourself.

26:48.356 --> 26:52.610
Uh...it's been good
to hear your voice, Bark.

26:54.279 --> 26:56.739
Must have cost you a lot to call me.

26:59.117 --> 27:01.118
Well, that's...

27:01.244 --> 27:03.621
that's a lot.

27:03.747 --> 27:07.374
You could have bought yourself a...
a good, warm scarf for that.

27:12.130 --> 27:13.714
All right, Bark.

27:15.884 --> 27:17.509
Goodbye, Bark.

27:19.638 --> 27:21.889
Goodbye...

27:22.015 --> 27:23.974
my dear.

27:35.403 --> 27:39.573
I guess I'll go to bed,
if you'll all excuse me.

27:39.699 --> 27:42.242
I'm tired.

27:42.369 --> 27:43.911
- Good night, everybody.
- Good night.

27:44.037 --> 27:46.038
Good night, Mother.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.840
- Sorry. Very sorry, Mrs Carr.
- (Shop bell)

27:56.966 --> 27:58.926
Ah, how are you today, Mr Cooper?

27:59.052 --> 28:01.053
- I'll be with you in a minute.
- (Shop bell)

28:01.179 --> 28:04.890
And then when you order the paper
by the week, Mrs Carr,

28:05.016 --> 28:08.852
I save it for you no matter
how many people are asking for it,

28:08.978 --> 28:10.854
and that way there are
no disappointments.

28:10.980 --> 28:13.399
All right. Shall I pay weekly or monthly?

28:13.525 --> 28:18.779
Well, if you are honest by the week,
I guess you can be honest by the month too.

28:18.905 --> 28:21.699
- So we'll make it by the week.
- All right.

28:27.205 --> 28:30.708
- (Shop bell)
- (Door closes)

28:30.834 --> 28:33.335
Saved the paper for you,
all right, Mr Cooper.

28:33.461 --> 28:36.463
Yeah? Well, I can't read it.
I broke my glasses again.

28:36.589 --> 28:39.758
(Chuckles) Oh !
What did Cora say this time?

28:39.884 --> 28:44.847
You should have heard her. Or maybe
you did. She hollered loud enough.

28:44.973 --> 28:50.644
(Chuckles) And you say it is nice
to live with your children, huh?

28:50.770 --> 28:54.106
Well, yes, it is, Mr Rubens, in a way.

28:54.232 --> 28:58.902
I hope I didn't give you the wrong
impression about Cora. She's a fine girl.

29:00.029 --> 29:03.115
I guess I'm pretty bothersome
to have around.

29:03.241 --> 29:05.826
- Ah.
- (Shop bell)

29:05.952 --> 29:09.788
- Well, what do you want?
- I want a stick of gum.

29:09.914 --> 29:12.124
(Rubens) Take it from the counter.

29:14.753 --> 29:20.716
All in all, my children are pretty fine
and I'm proud of 'em.

29:20.842 --> 29:22.760
I'm proud of mine too.

29:22.886 --> 29:25.053
They leave me alone.

29:25.180 --> 29:28.140
They don't need me, and I don't need them.

29:28.266 --> 29:30.559
I got enough to live from my store,

29:30.685 --> 29:34.396
and I got my Sarah,
and I make a little music with my violin.

29:34.522 --> 29:37.274
That's all I want from life, and I got it.

29:39.068 --> 29:42.279
Well, my life is just the same as yours,

29:43.823 --> 29:48.160
except I don't have a store,

29:48.286 --> 29:51.371
my wife is 300 miles away,

29:51.498 --> 29:55.042
and I...I can't play the violin.

29:55.168 --> 29:57.002
(Laughing)

29:58.379 --> 30:00.130
Hey, hey, hey.

30:02.926 --> 30:05.344
- Ha-ha-ha-ha !
- Heh-heh-heh !

30:05.470 --> 30:07.638
Go on, go on.

30:07.764 --> 30:09.306
- You know...
- (Shop bell)

30:09.432 --> 30:14.311
...I sometimes think that children
should never grow past the age

30:14.437 --> 30:17.606
when you have to tuck 'em into bed
every night.

30:17.732 --> 30:19.900
That's right.

30:20.026 --> 30:24.071
When they get older and you can't
give them as much as other children,

30:24.197 --> 30:26.406
they're ashamed of you.

30:26.533 --> 30:31.578
And when you give them everything
and put them through college

30:31.704 --> 30:35.040
- they're ashamed of you.
- Yeah.

30:35.166 --> 30:39.628
I guess the world is filled with
what you call schmi...schmills...

30:39.754 --> 30:42.047
- Schlemiels!
- (Both laugh)

30:42.173 --> 30:46.176
- And somebody has to raise 'em.
- (Laughs)

30:46.302 --> 30:48.345
- Ah.
- Mm-hm.

30:48.471 --> 30:50.180
(Shop bell)

30:52.267 --> 30:54.518
What do you want?

30:54.644 --> 30:57.354
Have you "Sincere Confessions"
for November?

30:57.480 --> 30:59.857
- Yes, ma'am.
- Ah.

31:04.571 --> 31:06.363
Thank you.

31:07.448 --> 31:11.326
Are you gonna be nice to your mother
when you grow up?

31:13.371 --> 31:16.623
- Jimmy, why don't you answer the man?
- What do I say?

31:16.749 --> 31:18.500
- Oh !
- (Chuckling)

31:18.626 --> 31:21.336
You say yes, of course!

31:21.462 --> 31:23.380
- (Door closes)
- (Shop bell)

31:23.506 --> 31:29.344
I'll miss our talks when you go away,
Mr Cooper, but I'll be glad for you.

31:29.470 --> 31:34.600
- You'll be with your wife again.
- Thanks. And I'll be with her soon.

31:34.726 --> 31:38.478
Maybe you could be sooner with her,
and right in this town.

31:38.605 --> 31:39.855
Huh?

31:39.981 --> 31:42.816
There's a lawyer, Mr Hunter, from New York.

31:42.942 --> 31:45.444
He just bought the Harrison farm,

31:45.570 --> 31:49.615
and he'll need caretakers,
a man and his wife.

31:49.741 --> 31:52.910
- Caretakers?
- I hear about things, you know.

31:53.036 --> 31:56.288
Oh, I wouldn't want to ask
my wife to do that.

31:56.414 --> 31:59.207
Anyway, my children would have a fit.

31:59.334 --> 32:01.877
So let them have a fit.

32:02.003 --> 32:06.340
You and your wife would be together
and you would earn your own living again.

32:07.675 --> 32:11.970
It's nice of you to suggest it,
but you understand, don't you?

32:12.096 --> 32:14.389
What difference does it make?

32:14.515 --> 32:18.143
Maybe it would be a home
for the rest of your life.

32:18.269 --> 32:23.565
But, say, everybody's got to do
what they think is best.

32:23.691 --> 32:27.402
Mr Rubens, I, uh...
I wonder if you'd do me a favour.

32:27.528 --> 32:29.488
Sure. Why not?

32:29.614 --> 32:31.698
Uh...it's from my wife.

32:31.824 --> 32:35.577
I... Would you read it to me,
on account of my...

32:35.703 --> 32:37.788
(Chuckling) Is that a favour, Mr Cooper?

32:41.501 --> 32:43.543
- Ready?
- Uh-huh.

32:45.672 --> 32:47.130
"Thursday night.

32:47.256 --> 32:50.634
"Dear Bark, I've been thinking of you all day

32:50.760 --> 32:53.762
"and have wanted to talk to you
worse than ever before."

32:53.888 --> 32:55.639
(Bark chuckles)

32:55.765 --> 32:59.059
"They say that you don't miss people
so much after a while,

32:59.185 --> 33:04.356
"but I think I miss you more than I did
at the beginning of our separation.

33:04.482 --> 33:09.945
"Do you realise that when you get this letter
it will be George's 46th birthday?

33:10.071 --> 33:12.864
"It seems like yesterday he was born.

33:12.991 --> 33:16.284
"We were so happy then
that it hurts to remember it.

33:17.787 --> 33:20.998
"I hate to give in and sound so weak,

33:21.124 --> 33:24.459
"but you understand me
and won't think less of me,

33:24.585 --> 33:26.837
"and this is just between us two."

33:28.464 --> 33:30.716
Yeah.

33:30.842 --> 33:36.430
"Harvey and Nellie know a woman who
is in the home for the aged women here.

33:36.556 --> 33:39.766
"They thought it would be
nice for me to know her,

33:39.892 --> 33:42.853
"so that I would have
someone my own age to talk to.

33:42.979 --> 33:45.147
"So Nellie took me there to meet her.

33:46.274 --> 33:50.235
"Oh, Bark, that home for the aged
is so dreary and dismal.

33:50.361 --> 33:53.739
"It was all I could do not to ask
Mrs Timmons how she stood it.

33:53.865 --> 33:57.325
"Nellie kept saying how lovely the place was.

33:57.452 --> 34:03.373
"I thought she said it to cheer Mrs Timmons up,
but she kept saying it after we left,

34:03.499 --> 34:07.836
"so I guess she really thought it was nice."

34:11.424 --> 34:13.842
I guess those places must be terrible.

34:15.344 --> 34:16.762
Go ahead.

34:20.141 --> 34:22.434
(Sighs)

34:22.560 --> 34:26.021
"Poor Nellie.
She hasn't been herself at all lately.

34:26.147 --> 34:30.567
"Her doctor wants her to have
a complete change. Nellie said Europe.

34:30.693 --> 34:34.862
"She's very worried,
not about herself, but...

34:34.989 --> 34:38.867
"but because that would mean
she couldn't take us like she promised.

34:38.993 --> 34:42.370
"But I told Nellie her health comes first.

34:42.496 --> 34:44.414
"Oh, Bark dear,

34:44.540 --> 34:49.795
"if only something would turn up
so that we could be together.

34:49.920 --> 34:51.838
"I love you so that..."

35:01.390 --> 35:04.976
Maybe you'd better wait
until you have your glasses fixed.

35:31.254 --> 35:34.381
- (Door opens and closes)
- (Shop bell)

35:38.386 --> 35:40.137
(Sniffs)

35:46.978 --> 35:48.895
Mama.

35:58.948 --> 36:00.907
Sarah !

36:01.033 --> 36:03.118
So, what do you want?

36:05.371 --> 36:07.581
I just wanted to look at you, Mama.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.499
To look at me?

36:09.625 --> 36:12.711
With all the work to be done,
you just wanted to look at me?

36:13.921 --> 36:16.173
Yes, Mama.

36:16.299 --> 36:18.884
I wanted to make sure you were here.

36:29.228 --> 36:32.272
I...I broke my glasses this morning.

36:32.398 --> 36:36.985
Would you mind telling me if there's
any bookkeepers wanted there?

36:38.446 --> 36:42.073
No. Why? Were you a bookkeeper?

36:42.200 --> 36:44.117
I am a bookkeeper.

36:52.543 --> 36:56.254
Well, you see, before she come here,

36:56.380 --> 36:59.841
when you all went out at night,
I always had the nights off.

36:59.967 --> 37:04.429
But, uh...well, all I mean is,

37:04.555 --> 37:09.100
if this keeps up,
I may have to seek other employment.

37:11.062 --> 37:14.439
Mamie,
Mrs Cooper doesn't stay up very late.

37:14.565 --> 37:19.736
Wait until she gets to sleep, and then
you can have the night off. All right?

37:19.862 --> 37:23.031
All right with me. But she ain't sleepy.

37:28.871 --> 37:32.916
Oh, you're all ready to go.
My, you both look awful nice!

37:33.042 --> 37:35.752
- Thank you, Mother C. You'll be all right?
- Of course.

37:35.878 --> 37:37.671
- Well, good night, Mother.
- Good night.

37:37.797 --> 37:39.631
Sure you'll be all right?
Rhoda's going out too.

37:39.757 --> 37:45.720
This isn't the first time you've left me
alone. Go ahead. Don't worry about me.

37:45.846 --> 37:47.764
But you'll be busy with your rug, won't you?

37:47.890 --> 37:51.685
Well, no, my head started to ache
a little while ago...

37:51.811 --> 37:54.229
- (Rocker creaking)
- ...and I think I'll stop.

37:54.355 --> 37:57.899
I'll find something to do.
There's always the radio.

37:58.025 --> 38:02.320
Oh, no, it isn't working, is it?
Well, I'd forgotten. No matter.

38:02.446 --> 38:06.741
You go ahead and enjoy yourselves.
Don't you even think about me.

38:06.867 --> 38:11.705
- Well, good night, Mother.
- Good night, dear.

38:11.831 --> 38:14.040
There's bicarbonate in the house,
isn't there?

38:14.166 --> 38:18.962
I feel just a mite as though
I'd have a little dyspepsia tonight.

38:22.216 --> 38:24.509
I know how you feel.

38:24.635 --> 38:27.512
Yes, dear, there's bicarbonate
in the medicine chest.

38:27.638 --> 38:32.225
- Well, just so I know, in case it gets bad.
- Well, maybe we'd better stay.

38:32.351 --> 38:34.227
Oh, no!

38:34.353 --> 38:37.439
You go right ahead and enjoy yourselves.

38:37.565 --> 38:39.983
- (Rocker creaking)
- We will.

38:41.777 --> 38:44.112
- Good night, dear.
- Good night.

38:47.199 --> 38:49.701
Maybe if you take a little walk, huh?

38:49.827 --> 38:52.871
Can't, on account of my arches.

38:52.997 --> 38:55.832
- (Rocker creaking)
- Oh. Good night, Mother.

38:55.958 --> 38:57.917
Good night.

39:09.263 --> 39:11.097
Mamie!

39:11.223 --> 39:14.267
- Yes, ma'am?
- You can have the night off.

39:15.895 --> 39:18.480
Oh, thank you very much.

39:18.606 --> 39:20.148
Good night.

39:25.446 --> 39:27.405
(Rhoda humming tune)

39:33.162 --> 39:35.830
(Chuckles) Oh, hi.

39:35.956 --> 39:39.626
I hope the boy you're going out with
tonight will get you home earlier, Rhoda.

39:39.752 --> 39:42.921
He's not a boy. He's 35.

39:43.047 --> 39:45.423
(Tutting) Thirty what?

39:45.549 --> 39:48.593
Well, that's a dangerous companion
for a young girl.

39:48.719 --> 39:50.637
Oh, you think so, huh?

39:50.763 --> 39:53.640
I guess you haven't been out
with any collegians lately.

39:53.766 --> 39:56.726
But at least among the boys your own age,

39:56.852 --> 39:59.938
you'll find the one you'll fall in love with
and want to marry.

40:00.064 --> 40:02.982
I'm going to look around a bit
before I get married.

40:03.109 --> 40:07.028
But a man doesn't want a girl
that runs around with everybody.

40:07.154 --> 40:09.781
I've seen plenty of swell fellows
walk down the aisles

40:09.907 --> 40:12.075
with girls that had done
everything but murder.

40:12.201 --> 40:15.453
Why, men get together and talk about girls.

40:15.579 --> 40:19.416
Yeah, and then they all make a dash for
the one that's been mentioned the most.

40:19.542 --> 40:22.168
Next lecture at half past Tuesday.

40:23.796 --> 40:27.382
Well, I won't be pickin' on you much longer.

40:27.508 --> 40:30.552
You'll soon have your room
to yourself again, Rhoda.

40:30.678 --> 40:32.887
Have you got some kind of a plan,
Grandma?

40:33.848 --> 40:36.891
Well, I haven't, but your grandpa has.

40:38.018 --> 40:40.728
His letter says that he's, uh...

40:40.855 --> 40:46.192
negotiating a piece of business
with some lawyer,

40:46.318 --> 40:52.782
and if it works out satisfactory,
then everything is gonna be all right.

40:52.908 --> 40:54.951
Oh.

40:55.077 --> 40:56.911
What's the matter?

40:58.247 --> 41:00.081
Why kid yourself, Grandma?

41:00.207 --> 41:02.959
You know he can't get a job.
He's...he's much too old.

41:03.085 --> 41:07.589
Well, I still have faith
in your grandpa's ability.

41:07.715 --> 41:10.341
That's just fooling yourself.

41:10.468 --> 41:13.011
Why don't you face facts, Grandma?

41:13.137 --> 41:15.555
Oh, Rhoda.

41:15.681 --> 41:19.642
When you're 17 and the world's beautiful

41:19.768 --> 41:27.525
facing facts is just as slick fun
as dancing or going to parties.

41:27.651 --> 41:33.323
But when you're 70...
well, you don't care about dancing,

41:33.449 --> 41:37.827
and you don't think about parties any more.

41:37.953 --> 41:41.372
And about the only fun you have left is

41:41.499 --> 41:45.460
pretending that there
ain't any facts to face.

41:46.754 --> 41:53.009
So would you mind
if I just kind of went on pretending?

42:02.228 --> 42:04.604
Grandma?

42:04.730 --> 42:07.732
I...I didn't mean to...

42:07.858 --> 42:09.984
Oh, I...I know, honey.

42:56.031 --> 42:59.951
Why don't you try to relax?
You'll wear yourself to a frazzle.

43:00.077 --> 43:02.203
But she could telephone or something.

43:02.329 --> 43:04.539
Don't you see?
Something terrible must have happened.

43:04.665 --> 43:08.626
I know Rhoda so well. I know
she wouldn't do a thing like this willingly.

43:13.215 --> 43:14.966
She must have met with an accident.

43:18.304 --> 43:20.930
I'll finish dressing in case
George wants me for anything.

43:21.056 --> 43:23.850
(Door opens and closes)

43:23.976 --> 43:26.144
(Phone ringing)

43:29.523 --> 43:32.108
Hello. Yes?

43:32.234 --> 43:35.069
This is Mrs Cooper.

43:35.195 --> 43:38.197
What? Don't talk so fast.

43:43.412 --> 43:47.123
You don't want me? Uh...hello?

43:47.249 --> 43:49.917
(Clicks receiver cradle)

43:50.044 --> 43:51.878
It was for you.

43:52.004 --> 43:54.547
Well, why didn't you let me talk?

43:54.673 --> 43:57.008
She hung up. She called about Rhoda.

43:57.134 --> 43:59.719
- What did she say? How is she?
- Oh, uh...

44:06.935 --> 44:09.145
I'll tell you.

44:09.271 --> 44:11.230
(Tuts) Oh, dear.

44:12.733 --> 44:14.776
Oh, my, oh, my.

44:16.528 --> 44:18.321
(Door closes)

44:32.544 --> 44:35.713
You don't know
how awful I feel about this, Anita.

44:35.839 --> 44:39.300
Let's not talk about it, if you don't mind,
at least not until we know more.

44:39.426 --> 44:41.803
Well, I just got to talk about it.

44:41.929 --> 44:45.598
I feel a little guilty.
I feel that I'm to blame a little bit.

44:45.724 --> 44:48.810
You see, I could have told you,
and maybe I should have told you.

44:48.936 --> 44:50.144
Told me what?

44:50.270 --> 44:56.025
Well, that Rhoda isn't always
just absolutely honest.

44:56.151 --> 45:01.030
One night when she and I went to the
movies, she met a boy. You didn't know.

45:01.156 --> 45:03.491
- Why didn't you tell me then?
- Well, I promised Rhoda.

45:03.617 --> 45:06.911
You promised Rhoda? What right had you
to assume that responsibility?

45:07.037 --> 45:10.331
- Rhoda promised that she'd never...
- What Rhoda promised is beside the point.

45:10.457 --> 45:12.834
What right have you to keep
Rhoda's actions a secret from me?

45:12.960 --> 45:16.587
- She's my child, not yours.
- Well, you were so busy with your...

45:16.714 --> 45:20.216
Oh, I'm so busy with my bridge and things.
I thought we'd get to that sooner or later.

45:20.342 --> 45:23.261
So, this is all my fault because
I try to make a few extra dollars.

45:23.387 --> 45:25.555
If it's anybody's fault, I know who to blame.

45:25.681 --> 45:28.391
Why do you suppose Rhoda stopped
inviting her friends here to the house?

45:28.517 --> 45:31.894
Why do you suppose she started meeting
them on the outside? I'm going to tell you !

45:32.020 --> 45:35.523
You like to entertain them ! They were
her friends, and you did all the talking!

45:35.649 --> 45:38.526
Why, Anita, I didn't know
I was doing anything wrong.

45:38.652 --> 45:40.653
You must have known
you were doing something wrong

45:40.779 --> 45:43.156
when you deliberately concealed
Rhoda's actions from me.

45:43.282 --> 45:46.159
You must have known you were doing
something that you had no right to do.

45:46.285 --> 45:49.912
You raised five children of your own.
You might let me raise one.

45:50.038 --> 45:52.498
- But you've got to butt in. You've got to...
- Anita !

45:58.547 --> 45:59.964
I'm sorry.

46:01.800 --> 46:04.135
I know how you feel.

46:04.261 --> 46:06.471
You're worried about Rhoda,

46:08.557 --> 46:10.892
so there won't be any hard feelings.

46:19.568 --> 46:21.402
(Coughing)

46:21.528 --> 46:23.321
I'll be glad when you go back to work.

46:23.447 --> 46:25.865
(Loud coughing)

46:25.991 --> 46:29.368
(Groans) I wish your mother was here.

46:29.495 --> 46:33.080
She'd get me on my feet so quick,
it'd make your head swim.

46:33.207 --> 46:36.584
You've only got a little cold.
What's the good of worrying Mother?

46:36.710 --> 46:38.377
(Doorbell)

46:38.504 --> 46:40.338
- Oh...
- Who on earth's that?

46:40.464 --> 46:42.131
(Doorbell)

46:43.133 --> 46:47.303
- Well, it must be the doctor.
- Good heavens! He got here quick enough.

46:47.429 --> 46:49.263
No, but... Wait a minute.

46:51.433 --> 46:52.850
- Come on.
- Huh?

46:52.976 --> 46:54.811
- Come on.
- All right.

47:03.487 --> 47:07.657
- Good morning, Doctor.
- Good morning, Mr Payne. Who's ill?

47:07.783 --> 47:10.201
This way, Doctor.

47:10.327 --> 47:11.953
Here he is.

47:13.956 --> 47:16.624
Hm. So this is the patient.

47:25.008 --> 47:26.884
He's shivering.

47:27.010 --> 47:31.556
You would, too, if you'd run through
the house in your nightshirt with bare feet.

47:31.682 --> 47:33.558
(Chuckles)

47:33.684 --> 47:37.395
- I, uh...I wouldn't let him do that.
- No.

47:41.859 --> 47:47.488
Your mother knows more about medicine
than all these young doctors put together.

47:48.866 --> 47:50.783
Ha-ha.

47:50.909 --> 47:54.495
Ha-ha. Well, we'll, uh...
We'll have a look at him.

47:56.164 --> 47:59.041
When a man's sick, he don't want a...

48:00.252 --> 48:02.336
How long have you been practisin'?

48:02.462 --> 48:04.964
Oh, for several, uh...

48:05.090 --> 48:07.216
That is, for some time now.

48:07.342 --> 48:09.135
How did you come to take it up?

48:09.261 --> 48:12.346
Why, my father's one of the biggest doctors
in this city.

48:16.602 --> 48:19.520
Why didn't you get his father?

48:19.646 --> 48:21.022
I'm sick.

48:21.148 --> 48:23.524
- Put that thermometer back in your mouth !
- (Groans)

48:23.650 --> 48:25.443
(Bill) Cora !

48:25.569 --> 48:27.111
Excuse me, Doctor.

48:31.074 --> 48:32.533
(Clears throat)

48:36.705 --> 48:38.247
(Groans)

48:40.834 --> 48:44.086
I wanted to talk to you
when your old man wasn't around.

48:44.212 --> 48:48.674
You think we ought to send for
your mother? I'm kind of sorry for him.

48:48.800 --> 48:52.428
So am I, but we haven't got room.
Once we got 'em both, we've got 'em.

48:52.554 --> 48:55.598
George would try and talk us into
keeping 'em. Nellie's run out on her.

48:55.724 --> 48:59.435
I burn when I think of her.
And Addie's doing nothing to help.

48:59.561 --> 49:01.395
Yeah. What about Addie?

49:03.315 --> 49:04.941
Hm.

49:05.817 --> 49:07.443
What about her?

49:20.040 --> 49:21.791
It's only a little over a hundred.

49:21.917 --> 49:25.044
If it goes any higher,
will you send for his dad?

49:25.170 --> 49:28.714
- (Chuckles) Now we'll do a little listening.
- Hm?

49:28.840 --> 49:32.635
- Sit up, please.
- (Grunts and coughs)

49:32.761 --> 49:35.888
- I suppose I'll get pneumonia now.
- That's it.

49:36.014 --> 49:40.059
Hm. Ooh ! That thing is cold as ice.

49:42.354 --> 49:44.355
Take a deep breath.

49:44.481 --> 49:46.899
(Grunts and coughs)

49:48.402 --> 49:50.444
Say 99.

49:50.570 --> 49:54.323
What for? That can't cure a cold.

49:54.449 --> 49:56.492
I'd rather say 23 to you,

49:56.618 --> 49:58.953
but I guess you're too young
to know that means "skidoo."

49:59.079 --> 50:01.330
Father, behave yourself and say 99.

50:01.456 --> 50:04.500
Darned if I will. I'd feel foolish.

50:04.626 --> 50:09.088
I'm too old to play games
with the neighbours' youngsters, Cora.

50:09.214 --> 50:12.049
- You mustn't mind him, Doctor.
- That's quite all right.

50:12.175 --> 50:16.971
Going around as I do, I run into all kinds
of patients. Come on, Mr Cooper, say 99.

50:17.097 --> 50:20.141
I will not,
and I'll bet you haven't got many patients.

50:21.268 --> 50:25.354
I've had lots of colds,
and I always got over 'em all right before.

50:25.480 --> 50:28.065
And I never had to say...

50:28.191 --> 50:29.817
that number.

50:30.902 --> 50:32.737
All right.

50:32.863 --> 50:34.905
Now we'll listen to your heart.

50:35.032 --> 50:37.283
Yeah. I didn't say it.

50:37.409 --> 50:39.827
(Doorbell)

50:42.748 --> 50:45.958
- Yes? What do you want?
- Excuse me.

50:46.084 --> 50:50.296
My name is Max Rubens. I have
the paper store down on Graham Street.

50:50.422 --> 50:52.590
We have a boy who delivers 'em.

50:52.716 --> 50:55.217
(Doorbell)

50:57.137 --> 51:00.681
(Chuckling) I...
I wasn't trying to do business.

51:00.807 --> 51:02.933
But it is always a good idea, huh?

51:06.438 --> 51:08.773
- You're Cora, no?
- Yes.

51:08.899 --> 51:12.651
Mm-hm. Your father speaks of you.

51:12.778 --> 51:16.906
It's on account of him I come like this.
I heard he was sick.

51:17.032 --> 51:20.868
- A slight cold. It's nothin'.
- Oh. Could I see him?

51:20.994 --> 51:24.830
The doctor don't want him to have
any visitors. Visitors would upset him.

51:24.956 --> 51:27.208
It's more likely your father
would upset the visitors.

51:27.334 --> 51:29.168
Certainly they won't hurt him.

51:32.005 --> 51:35.883
- All right. If the doctor says so. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

51:36.009 --> 51:37.635
Right in there.

51:39.387 --> 51:43.766
- What's the matter, Doctor?
- Nothing to be alarmed about, Mrs Payne.

51:43.892 --> 51:48.270
I...I was looking at your father's throat,
and he bit me.

51:48.396 --> 51:50.481
I'm sorry.

51:50.607 --> 51:53.734
Keep him in bed
and put mustard plasters on his chest.

51:59.699 --> 52:02.118
About his cold...

52:02.244 --> 52:06.288
This winter weather and everything.

52:06.414 --> 52:09.875
Wouldn't it be a good idea
if I sent him to California?

52:10.001 --> 52:14.839
(Chuckles) I...I'd think it'd be a good idea
if you could send him almost anywhere.

52:14.965 --> 52:16.966
I felt sure you'd say that, Doctor.

52:17.092 --> 52:20.219
All along, I felt that Father
couldn't stand these awful winters,

52:20.345 --> 52:23.013
and California'd be better.

52:23.140 --> 52:26.934
- It certainly is wonderful soup, Mr Rubens.
- Sure.

52:27.060 --> 52:29.645
Yeah, I can feel it warming me all over.

52:29.771 --> 52:33.440
Sure it's wonderful. My wife made it
as soon as she heard you were sick.

52:33.567 --> 52:36.110
- Hm?
- Just like me, she wants you to get well.

52:36.236 --> 52:38.362
(Chuckling) Yeah. That's nice of her.

52:39.948 --> 52:45.119
Now, if somebody
would only call up my wife.

52:48.665 --> 52:51.417
But your daughter
can take good care of you,

52:51.543 --> 52:54.211
and maybe she don't want
her mother around, kibitzing.

52:54.337 --> 52:56.547
You know how it is.

52:56.673 --> 53:00.009
- Now, I've got to fix your mustard plaster.
- Mm.

53:00.135 --> 53:02.928
- What are you eating?
- Some soup Mrs Rubens made for me.

53:03.054 --> 53:05.264
- Wasn't that nice?
- That's fine, isn't it?

53:05.390 --> 53:07.641
- Mm. You bet it is.
- (Laughs)

53:07.767 --> 53:10.060
The neighbours think
I don't feed you properly, I guess.

53:10.187 --> 53:12.730
- Hm?
- Don't eat it. How do I know what's in it?

53:12.856 --> 53:15.983
There's nothing in that soup
but good chicken.

53:16.109 --> 53:18.068
- Mm-hm.
- When my Sarah makes...

53:18.195 --> 53:21.113
Your Sarah can mind her own business.
I cook for my father.

53:21.239 --> 53:24.200
You should live
until you can cook like my Sarah.

53:24.326 --> 53:25.743
Oh?

53:26.536 --> 53:28.245
Don't put any more of that in your stomach.

53:28.371 --> 53:30.456
Yeah. I'm afraid it's all gone, Cora.

53:30.582 --> 53:32.374
You mean you ate all this mess?

53:34.794 --> 53:38.714
Mrs Payne, for myself I don't care. Mm-hm.

53:38.840 --> 53:43.510
But my Sarah, when she makes a soup,
a king can eat it, and she worked...

53:43.637 --> 53:47.139
You can tell your Sarah if he's sick tonight,
she can come take care of him.

53:47.265 --> 53:50.476
- Goodbye, Mr Cooper.
- Goodbye.

53:50.602 --> 53:53.354
And thanks for coming.

53:53.480 --> 53:55.314
And thanks for the...

53:56.066 --> 53:57.566
Thanks.

54:02.530 --> 54:04.365
(Mouths words)

54:07.202 --> 54:09.203
(Chuckling)

54:09.329 --> 54:11.205
(Coughing)

54:19.547 --> 54:21.674
What's the matter with you?

54:21.800 --> 54:23.175
Nothing.

54:28.598 --> 54:31.433
- Will you please stop worrying, Mother?
- Oh, I can't.

54:31.559 --> 54:34.144
But Cora said
his temperature is normal tonight.

54:34.271 --> 54:37.022
But it may be up again tomorrow.

54:37.148 --> 54:39.900
Anyway, your father
doesn't like his doctor.

54:40.026 --> 54:43.779
Look, Mother,
his temperature is normal tonight.

54:43.905 --> 54:46.323
But it may be up again tomorrow.

54:46.449 --> 54:48.325
Isn't this where we came in?

54:50.245 --> 54:51.620
(Whispers) Shut up.

54:51.746 --> 54:54.915
Mother, will you please
stop borrowing trouble?

54:55.041 --> 54:58.168
Oh, dear. I guess I'll go see how Anita is.

54:58.295 --> 55:00.462
Uh...no, no, no.

55:00.588 --> 55:02.381
I'd better go, Mother. Hm?

55:06.845 --> 55:08.637
(Rocker creaking)

55:10.682 --> 55:13.100
Now, stop it, honey.

55:13.226 --> 55:17.021
- You're just going to make yourself ill.
- I can't seem to help it.

55:17.147 --> 55:20.441
But Mrs Claire promised to keep
Rhoda's name out of the case.

55:20.567 --> 55:24.486
Everything is going to be all right.
It's you that I'm worried about.

55:24.612 --> 55:26.947
Gosh, I never saw you give in so completely.

55:27.073 --> 55:29.283
But everything's gone wrong.

55:29.409 --> 55:32.786
I care as much about your mother
as any daughter-in-law can, but...

55:32.912 --> 55:35.205
- What's Mother got to do with it?
- Well, didn't she tell you that I...

55:35.332 --> 55:40.210
Oh, yes, she said something about
an argument, but never mind that, dear.

55:40.337 --> 55:43.339
But there's no place for your mother to go,
now that Nellie's backed out.

55:43.465 --> 55:47.718
And Rhoda positively refuses to bring
her friends home while she's here.

55:47.844 --> 55:50.512
- What are we going to do?
- I don't know. I don't know.

55:50.638 --> 55:53.182
Take this business today,
it never would have happened

55:53.308 --> 55:56.810
if Rhoda had been able to entertain
her friends at home as she used to.

55:56.936 --> 56:01.315
I used to know all of Rhoda's men friends
and what was going on, but now...

56:01.441 --> 56:05.527
I know. Rhoda used to have
the house full of her friends.

56:05.653 --> 56:10.240
She's got to have them again, George.
She's got to. Don't you see?

56:10.367 --> 56:14.244
What happened today is just a sample.
She'll be leaving us next.

56:14.371 --> 56:16.121
- Oh, no, no.
- Oh, yes, she will.

56:16.247 --> 56:19.124
She'll get a job
and an apartment of her own.

56:19.250 --> 56:22.503
- Those things happen, don't they?
- And we're helpless to stop it.

56:24.172 --> 56:29.760
We can't turn your mother out into
the streets, and yet she's driving Rhoda...

56:29.886 --> 56:32.513
I know. I...I know.

56:36.309 --> 56:38.143
- Maybe...
- What, dear?

56:38.269 --> 56:41.271
Hm? Oh, nothing. Nothing.

56:43.191 --> 56:45.651
(Swingtime jazz on radio)

56:51.825 --> 56:54.368
(Vocalising)

56:59.374 --> 57:02.376
- Did I awaken you, Grandma?
- It doesn't matter.

57:02.502 --> 57:05.254
- Is there any mail?
- I think so.

57:05.380 --> 57:07.297
(Music continues)

58:07.567 --> 58:09.485
(Rocker creaks)

58:20.705 --> 58:22.664
- Good evening, Mother C.
- Hello, Ma.

58:22.790 --> 58:24.333
Hi.

58:35.762 --> 58:37.679
(Rocker creaks)

58:40.433 --> 58:42.059
(Anita) Rhoda.

58:43.228 --> 58:44.978
(Radio off)

58:57.075 --> 58:58.951
(Rocker creaks)

59:05.792 --> 59:08.460
I spoke to your father today, George.

59:10.088 --> 59:13.048
He told me that he's perfectly well again.

59:13.174 --> 59:15.467
Yes.

59:15.593 --> 59:17.469
We've got to keep him well, Mother.

59:19.222 --> 59:21.890
The trouble is,
that can't be done in this climate.

59:23.810 --> 59:28.564
Cora's doctor says that Father positively
has to go where there are no hard winters,

59:29.732 --> 59:35.279
and we thought, on account
of Addie living in California...

59:35.405 --> 59:37.948
He's going out there to live?

59:38.074 --> 59:40.826
Just for a little while,
for his health, dear.

59:40.952 --> 59:43.495
Oh, of course.

59:43.621 --> 59:46.373
I want him to be well.

59:46.499 --> 59:48.500
There isn't anything I...I want as much,

59:48.626 --> 59:51.837
unless it's that you children
should be healthy and happy.

59:53.965 --> 59:57.259
Cora thought
that Addie would take you both.

59:58.511 --> 01:00:00.512
Addie says she can't.

01:00:02.807 --> 01:00:06.226
As long as she takes Father, that's enough.

01:00:08.021 --> 01:00:09.563
Well...

01:00:11.316 --> 01:00:13.859
He'll be leaving soon?

01:00:13.985 --> 01:00:15.694
I guess so.

01:00:17.530 --> 01:00:21.366
Maybe I'll be able to see him
to say goodbye?

01:00:21.492 --> 01:00:24.119
Oh. Of course.

01:00:26.581 --> 01:00:28.290
Mother.

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:31.793
There's something else I've got to tell you.

01:00:32.754 --> 01:00:35.088
Well, there's something
I'd like to say to you first.

01:00:35.214 --> 01:00:38.258
Let me do it while I can. You tell me later.

01:00:38.384 --> 01:00:40.385
- (Rocker creaks)
- Well, it's only this.

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:47.142
I don't want to hurt your feelings,
but I haven't been too happy here.

01:00:47.268 --> 01:00:48.518
(Sniffs)

01:00:48.645 --> 01:00:53.148
It's lonesome in this apartment
with everybody gone all day.

01:00:54.442 --> 01:00:58.195
Uh...would you mind terribly

01:00:59.614 --> 01:01:05.077
if I decided to leave you
to go to the Idylwild Home?

01:01:14.462 --> 01:01:16.463
Well, it's a fine place.

01:01:17.674 --> 01:01:20.842
I'd meet friends my own age, and...

01:01:20.968 --> 01:01:24.513
- But, Mother, I didn't...
- No, now, let me finish, dear.

01:01:26.307 --> 01:01:32.062
Once I thought that your father and I
might get together again,

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:38.402
but, well, I...
I see that it'll never turn out that way.

01:01:40.113 --> 01:01:42.280
So I want to go to the home.

01:01:45.118 --> 01:01:46.535
(Sighs)

01:01:46.661 --> 01:01:49.871
- (Rocker creaks)
- Well, I'm glad that's over.

01:01:51.958 --> 01:01:57.963
I hated to tell you as much as you would
have hated to tell me anything like that.

01:01:59.048 --> 01:02:01.717
Oh, there's just one more thing, dear.

01:02:01.843 --> 01:02:07.389
I'd like to stay here
until your father's on his way to California.

01:02:07.515 --> 01:02:10.058
He's funny about things, you know.

01:02:10.184 --> 01:02:13.812
He'd never believe
that the home was a grand place.

01:02:13.938 --> 01:02:18.108
- (Rocker creaking)
- He's a little old-fashioned, Father is.

01:02:19.527 --> 01:02:22.195
Those places seem terrible to him.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:27.075
He must never know that I'm going.

01:02:28.536 --> 01:02:35.542
And you tell Cora and Nellie and the others
that he must never know.

01:02:35.668 --> 01:02:39.421
This is one thing
that has to be handled my way.

01:02:41.007 --> 01:02:43.133
Yes, Mother.

01:02:43.259 --> 01:02:48.305
Just let him go on thinking
that I'm living with you and Anita.

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:52.225
You can always forward my letters.

01:02:54.312 --> 01:02:55.896
(Chuckles)

01:02:57.064 --> 01:03:00.400
It'll be the first secret
I've ever had from him.

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:05.655
It'll...It'll seem mighty funny.

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:07.240
(Chuckles)

01:03:08.201 --> 01:03:10.327
Oh, well.

01:03:10.453 --> 01:03:12.037
(Sighs)

01:03:17.335 --> 01:03:22.589
Here's another little secret,
just between us two.

01:03:26.844 --> 01:03:31.223
You were always my favourite child.

01:03:41.025 --> 01:03:43.652
Well, that's that.

01:03:46.989 --> 01:03:50.700
As the years go by,
you can always look back on this day

01:03:50.827 --> 01:03:52.953
and be mighty proud of me.

01:04:02.296 --> 01:04:05.298
- (Rocker squeaking)
- Take it easy there.

01:04:06.634 --> 01:04:08.260
(Rocker squeaking)

01:04:22.233 --> 01:04:24.860
- Oh, come in, Mamie.
- Thank you.

01:04:28.072 --> 01:04:30.490
- You going down to meet the bus, huh?
- Mm-hm.

01:04:30.616 --> 01:04:32.617
And won't you be glad to see your husband?

01:04:32.743 --> 01:04:34.327
Yes, indeed.

01:04:34.453 --> 01:04:38.081
Oh, Mamie, you won't be here tonight
when I come back to get my things

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:41.334
and I want to give you
a little remembrance I made for you

01:04:41.460 --> 01:04:44.963
- and to thank you for everything.
- Oh, thank you, Mrs Cooper.

01:04:45.089 --> 01:04:46.715
But there's nothing to thank me for.

01:04:46.841 --> 01:04:50.719
Oh, I'll always remember
how nice you were to me.

01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:56.016
(Chuckles) Oh, by the way, Mamie, you'll
be getting some nights off from now on.

01:04:56.142 --> 01:04:58.184
- (Chuckles) Oh.
- I know.

01:04:58.311 --> 01:05:01.688
Yes, ma'am.
They even give me the afternoon off.

01:05:01.814 --> 01:05:04.190
In fact, I'm going right now
to meet my husband.

01:05:05.985 --> 01:05:08.570
- So am I.
- Yeah.

01:05:36.724 --> 01:05:41.478
Will you stop lookin' at your watch?
We've got five whole hours.

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:45.065
We mustn't even think about the time.

01:05:53.950 --> 01:05:56.701
I guess you're right, Lucy.

01:05:58.371 --> 01:06:06.419
Well, Bark, I figure that everyone is
entitled to just so much happiness in life.

01:06:06.545 --> 01:06:10.966
Some get it in the beginning, and some
in the middle, and others at the end.

01:06:11.926 --> 01:06:17.555
And then there are those that have it
spread thin all through the years.

01:06:19.058 --> 01:06:22.352
The trouble is, I was a failure.

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:28.108
I suppose you liked me because I knew
a couple ofjokes and could make you laugh.

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:30.735
I was the town clown,

01:06:30.861 --> 01:06:36.658
but there wasn't much room in the business
world, Lucy, for that kind of a fella.

01:06:36.784 --> 01:06:39.661
I won't let you call yourself
a failure, Bark.

01:06:41.038 --> 01:06:44.416
I think I slipped up some place,

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:50.922
though I tried always to be
a good wife and mother.

01:06:53.634 --> 01:06:57.804
But if I'd been all that I thought I was,
things would be different now.

01:06:59.098 --> 01:07:03.768
You don't sow wheat and reap ashes, Pa.

01:07:10.234 --> 01:07:11.651
Oh, come on.

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:14.487
Let's get out of here.

01:07:19.368 --> 01:07:21.202
(Traffic)

01:07:40.890 --> 01:07:43.433
- (Bell)
- (Whistle blows)

01:07:47.063 --> 01:07:50.148
Excuse me a minute, Ma.
I want to get something. I'll be right out.

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:54.735
(Horn sounds)

01:08:15.758 --> 01:08:17.509
(Whistle blows)

01:08:18.260 --> 01:08:20.178
(Doorbell)

01:08:22.014 --> 01:08:24.224
Come on, Pa.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:26.643
- They didn't have my size.
- Uh-huh.

01:08:35.861 --> 01:08:38.154
- Fine time to tell us.
- Hm.

01:08:52.419 --> 01:08:57.465
You know,
I always wanted to buy you a nice car,

01:08:57.591 --> 01:09:01.511
but it seems we always had to use
the money for something else.

01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:04.639
- Do you see the old couple out there?
- Uh-huh.

01:09:04.765 --> 01:09:08.100
It's always those kind
that have a million bucks salted away.

01:09:08.227 --> 01:09:10.728
Well, I'm going out
and pry them loose from some of it.

01:09:10.854 --> 01:09:12.522
(Chuckles)

01:09:12.648 --> 01:09:16.484
If he's got a million bucks salted away,
I'll bet he's forgotten where he put it.

01:09:18.404 --> 01:09:22.657
Uh...my name's Ed Weldon. Of course,
you don't know me from Adam's father.

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:24.658
But you can judge
something of my character

01:09:24.785 --> 01:09:28.162
when I tell you I'm permitted
to represent this automobile.

01:09:28.288 --> 01:09:30.915
Of course, the car sells itself.

01:09:31.041 --> 01:09:34.042
When I tell you it's considered
the mechanical wonder of the age,

01:09:34.170 --> 01:09:35.627
you'll be surprised.

01:09:35.754 --> 01:09:40.591
But when you ride in it and find
how smooth it runs, you'll be astonished.

01:09:40.718 --> 01:09:43.386
I don't expect we'll get to ride in it.

01:09:43.511 --> 01:09:46.346
Well, why not?
Have you a little time right now?

01:09:46.473 --> 01:09:49.475
Now, my car's right there,
exactly like this one.

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.478
How about it?

01:09:54.106 --> 01:09:58.067
Oh, well, we couldn't.
We're having dinner with our children.

01:09:58.194 --> 01:10:02.197
- Well, but I can take you there.
- Oh, no. You needn't bother about that.

01:10:02.323 --> 01:10:04.073
A ride up the drive, perhaps.

01:10:05.659 --> 01:10:07.452
Oh, we couldn't, Bark.

01:10:10.289 --> 01:10:14.000
- Why not?
- Now, that's the proper spirit.

01:10:14.126 --> 01:10:16.085
- Come on. Let's go.
- Well !

01:10:22.551 --> 01:10:25.637
- Pretty nice, isn't it, Bark?
- Yes, indeed.

01:10:25.763 --> 01:10:28.640
- Are you warm enough?
- Uh-huh. Are you?

01:10:28.766 --> 01:10:32.310
Oh, yes. I'm very comfortable.

01:10:32.436 --> 01:10:35.396
- Say...
- Weldon.

01:10:35.522 --> 01:10:40.109
- Say, this is awful nice of you, Mr Weldon.
- That's nothing, Mr Cooper.

01:10:40.236 --> 01:10:43.154
I only hope the children aren't worried
about us. You know, we really...

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:46.157
You remember,
we took a ride up the Hudson

01:10:46.283 --> 01:10:48.534
when we came to New York
on our honeymoon.

01:10:48.661 --> 01:10:49.827
Of course I remember.

01:10:49.954 --> 01:10:53.331
I always intended
we should do it again some day,

01:10:53.457 --> 01:10:57.669
but we never got anywhere much
after our honeymoon, did we?

01:11:00.798 --> 01:11:06.886
I guess this is the first time that we've
been away from home together since, uh...

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:10.890
...our honeymoon.

01:11:11.016 --> 01:11:13.643
It doesn't matter, Bark. I had the children.

01:11:13.769 --> 01:11:18.314
Yeah, and I used to go down
to the barbershop every night with the boys

01:11:18.440 --> 01:11:20.942
and left you at home to sew and...

01:11:22.152 --> 01:11:24.570
I'm ashamed of myself, Lucy.

01:11:24.697 --> 01:11:28.783
I've been trying to recall
the places we went on our honeymoon.

01:11:28.909 --> 01:11:30.994
We went to the theatre twice, I remember.

01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.997
Uh...three times.
We went to a matinée one day.

01:11:34.123 --> 01:11:35.790
Oh, so we did.

01:11:35.916 --> 01:11:38.251
And then we went to the park
to hear the band,

01:11:38.377 --> 01:11:41.170
and we took a drive over Brooklyn Bridge.

01:11:41.297 --> 01:11:44.632
- In a hansom cab.
- Mm. On a Thursday.

01:11:45.592 --> 01:11:47.468
No, that was Wednesday.

01:11:47.594 --> 01:11:49.595
I can remember too.

01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:52.890
Yeah. Never mind.

01:11:53.017 --> 01:11:56.227
- Do you remember going to the museum?
- Of course I do.

01:11:56.353 --> 01:11:58.271
You do not. You never went.

01:11:58.397 --> 01:12:01.107
You said you didn't like museums.

01:12:01.233 --> 01:12:03.318
(Both chuckling)

01:12:03.444 --> 01:12:06.863
I wonder if the Hotel Vogard
is still standing.

01:12:06.989 --> 01:12:09.157
Yeah, the Vogard's on lower Fifth Avenue.

01:12:09.283 --> 01:12:14.037
I remember it was a very nice place
run by nice people.

01:12:14.163 --> 01:12:17.248
Say, Lucy, what about going down,
taking a look at it and having a cup of tea?

01:12:17.374 --> 01:12:19.792
- It'd do you good.
- Oh, no, Bark. We couldn't.

01:12:19.918 --> 01:12:22.295
- Why not? Who's to stop us.
- Well, the children are...

01:12:22.421 --> 01:12:23.421
Mr Weldon.

01:12:23.547 --> 01:12:25.965
- I certainly can, Mr Cooper.
- He's gonna take us.

01:12:26.091 --> 01:12:29.510
How do you like this car's performance?
Isn't it smooth?

01:12:29.636 --> 01:12:31.637
Oh, it's perfect, Mr Weldon.

01:12:31.764 --> 01:12:35.892
We never rode
in a better automobile in our life.

01:12:36.018 --> 01:12:38.311
- Thanks.
- Have we, Ma?

01:12:47.321 --> 01:12:49.530
- My, it's nice to see it again.
- Yeah.

01:12:49.656 --> 01:12:51.991
- How about the car?
- Oh, it's fine.

01:12:52.117 --> 01:12:55.078
You think you'd be interested
in buying a car like this?

01:12:55.204 --> 01:12:56.412
In buying one?

01:12:56.538 --> 01:13:00.875
Oh, we couldn't buy an automobile,
but we do appreciate the compliment.

01:13:01.001 --> 01:13:06.339
Well, why not? A car's no longer a luxury.
It's, uh...it's a necessity.

01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:10.093
Why, were you expecting
to sell us an automobi...

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:13.888
- (Bark chuckles)
- Oh, I'm so sorry we took your time.

01:13:14.014 --> 01:13:17.058
Why, we thought that you were
really proud of your automobile

01:13:17.184 --> 01:13:19.852
and just sort of wanted to show it off.

01:13:19.978 --> 01:13:23.815
Well, I'm glad you enjoyed it.
You know, I enjoyed myself too.

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:28.319
I didn't have anything to do. In fact, you...
you were right in the first place.

01:13:28.445 --> 01:13:32.031
(Chuckles) I, uh...
I just wanted to show the car off.

01:13:32.157 --> 01:13:34.534
Oh, well, that makes me feel better.

01:13:34.660 --> 01:13:37.578
- Thank you and goodbye.
- You're more than welcome.

01:13:37.704 --> 01:13:39.080
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

01:13:39.206 --> 01:13:42.166
- We...we didn't touch anything anyway.
- No.

01:13:48.132 --> 01:13:49.966
(Chatter)

01:13:56.849 --> 01:13:58.474
(Small orchestra playing)

01:14:00.894 --> 01:14:03.354
- Oh ! Oh !
- (Chuckling)

01:14:04.356 --> 01:14:05.815
- May I have your coat?
- Thank you.

01:14:05.941 --> 01:14:08.526
- Did you see what I did?
- Yes, dear.

01:14:08.652 --> 01:14:11.571
I never was so embarrassed in all my life.

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:15.116
Well, get out. You were too.
I could tell you several times.

01:14:15.242 --> 01:14:17.285
- (Laughs)
- Thank you.

01:14:17.411 --> 01:14:22.874
Oh, I better get a cheque right here.
Could I have a cheque, please?

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:25.293
- Oh, you won't need one. I'll remember you.
- Oh, thank you.

01:14:25.419 --> 01:14:29.547
- You're strangers here, aren't you?
- Well, not exactly.

01:14:29.673 --> 01:14:33.634
We spent our honeymoon here
50 years ago.

01:14:33.760 --> 01:14:34.760
- Oh, really?
- Yeah.

01:14:34.887 --> 01:14:38.306
Well, then you must remember this,
our old lobby.

01:14:43.270 --> 01:14:44.854
Remember, Ma?

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:46.939
I should say we do.

01:14:48.358 --> 01:14:52.069
It certainly is different than it was then.

01:14:52.196 --> 01:14:54.530
(Chuckles) Yeah, so are we.

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:56.282
(Chuckling)

01:15:16.386 --> 01:15:18.346
(No audible dialogue)

01:15:46.833 --> 01:15:49.835
Well, what'll it be?

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:52.630
- Well, uh...
- Cocktails maybe?

01:15:52.756 --> 01:15:54.840
Well, he's gonna have one.

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:57.843
Well, why don't you have one, Ma?

01:15:57.970 --> 01:16:00.388
Ladies are drinking here.

01:16:12.901 --> 01:16:15.611
Hm? Two cocktails.

01:16:15.737 --> 01:16:18.322
- What kind... How about old-fashioneds?

01:16:18.448 --> 01:16:22.410
Yeah. Two old-fashioneds
for two old-fashioned people.

01:16:22.536 --> 01:16:25.329
- (Both laugh)
- Say, that's all right.

01:16:26.540 --> 01:16:29.000
Are you sure there's no calls for me?

01:16:29.126 --> 01:16:30.876
OK.

01:16:31.003 --> 01:16:35.464
- Well, that's funny.
- No, it isn't. That roast'll be ruined.

01:16:35.591 --> 01:16:38.175
I don't care about the roast.
I'm worried about Father and Mother.

01:16:38.302 --> 01:16:39.969
I wonder where they can be.

01:16:40.095 --> 01:16:42.054
Ah, they're probably having a grand time

01:16:42.180 --> 01:16:45.349
talking about the few hours they got left
before Pop's train leaves.

01:16:45.475 --> 01:16:46.684
Some fun, huh?

01:16:46.810 --> 01:16:51.272
Crenshaw hotel chain has owned
the Vogard since shortly after the war.

01:16:51.398 --> 01:16:52.815
But that doesn't mean, Mr and Mrs Cooper,

01:16:52.941 --> 01:16:56.068
we're not just as glad to see you
as the old management could have been.

01:16:56.194 --> 01:16:59.488
Well, we just think it's awful nice of you
to bother to see us, Mr Norton.

01:16:59.615 --> 01:17:00.823
- Ah, yes, indeed.
- Not at all.

01:17:00.949 --> 01:17:02.325
The hotel's friends are my friends.

01:17:02.451 --> 01:17:06.704
Well, I never thought
I'd be sitting here, drinking like this.

01:17:06.830 --> 01:17:09.290
You know, ladies never used to.

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:12.335
Why, you wouldn't believe it if I told you

01:17:12.461 --> 01:17:16.172
that on the first Thursday,
we were here on our honeymoon,

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:18.341
we just started for Brooklyn Bridge.

01:17:18.467 --> 01:17:22.428
The aquarium, uh...was Wednesday.

01:17:22.554 --> 01:17:27.308
Ain't it funny how women always get the
weekdays mixed up along with other things?

01:17:28.810 --> 01:17:30.436
It was Wednesday.

01:17:31.772 --> 01:17:33.773
I remember we started out.

01:17:35.692 --> 01:17:38.027
I got lost right away.

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:40.863
- (Chuckling)
- But it was Thursday.

01:17:40.989 --> 01:17:44.742
- Now, look, Bark, we got married on...
- Tuesday.

01:17:44.868 --> 01:17:46.577
(Chuckling) Oh, no, no.

01:17:48.163 --> 01:17:51.957
We were going to be married on Tuesday,
and then we postponed it,

01:17:52.084 --> 01:17:55.503
so my sister could get there
from New Hampshire, remember?

01:17:55.629 --> 01:17:57.171
- Mm.
- She was snowbound, with the mumps.

01:17:57.297 --> 01:17:59.215
- Mm.
- (Laughing)

01:18:00.342 --> 01:18:04.553
Remember, she was visiting that girl
who was married to that fellow

01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.181
who was related to those people
who had a daughter in the south.

01:18:07.307 --> 01:18:09.517
- Without the mumps.
- (Chuckling)

01:18:10.977 --> 01:18:15.564
- Well, the point is that we were married.
- (Chuckling)

01:18:15.691 --> 01:18:17.775
Yeah, we were married, all right.

01:18:17.901 --> 01:18:19.819
(Laughing)

01:18:19.945 --> 01:18:24.240
Well, the point is, we were married
on Wednesday instead of Tuesday.

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:27.702
No...no. That's not the point at all.

01:18:27.828 --> 01:18:32.707
We were trying to figure out
which day we went to the aquarium.

01:18:32.833 --> 01:18:35.126
Oh, well, that was Thursday.

01:18:35.252 --> 01:18:39.755
(Chuckling) I'm sure
it must have been, Mrs Cooper.

01:18:39.881 --> 01:18:41.716
I wonder if you'll excuse me now.

01:18:41.842 --> 01:18:45.469
If you want anything, just ask for it,
and let me know if you don't get it.

01:18:45.595 --> 01:18:48.681
- Now, you shouldn't have done that.
- It was my pleasure.

01:18:48.807 --> 01:18:50.683
- Thank you, Mr Norton.
- (Crowd applauding)

01:18:51.435 --> 01:18:53.269
(Orchestra playing)

01:18:54.855 --> 01:18:57.231
(Laughs) Was it Wednesday?

01:18:57.357 --> 01:18:59.108
(Chuckles)

01:19:00.986 --> 01:19:03.362
Lucy, are you getting a little tipsy?

01:19:05.282 --> 01:19:06.991
(Both chuckle)

01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:13.372
Let me hear you say this.
Betty Botter bought a batch of bitter butter.

01:19:15.333 --> 01:19:18.627
Betty Botter bought a batch of bitter butter.

01:19:18.754 --> 01:19:21.005
- (Both chuckle)
- Now say this one.

01:19:21.131 --> 01:19:25.593
Betty Botter bought a batch
of baby buggy rubber bumpers.

01:19:28.054 --> 01:19:32.266
Betty Botter bought a batch of baby bu...

01:19:32.392 --> 01:19:34.602
- (Both laugh)
- You can't do it.

01:19:35.771 --> 01:19:37.646
You got that one at the barbershop.

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.774
(Chuckles) Yeah, I guess so.

01:19:41.359 --> 01:19:43.819
- Oh, Bark, we've got to go.
- Why?

01:19:43.945 --> 01:19:47.823
Well, the children are waiting,
and Nellie's gonna cook dinner.

01:19:47.949 --> 01:19:51.243
Well, we're not going. We're having fun.

01:19:51.369 --> 01:19:54.371
And how many times
have we had to wait dinner for them?

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:58.751
I think I can fix it up.

01:20:00.378 --> 01:20:02.213
In a nice way.

01:20:05.175 --> 01:20:08.260
Hello. Hello, Nellie.

01:20:08.386 --> 01:20:10.679
This is your father. Remember me?

01:20:12.349 --> 01:20:17.394
No, there hasn't been any accident,
except that we're having a good time.

01:20:18.688 --> 01:20:21.649
(Chuckles) Your dinner?
Oh, isn't that too bad?

01:20:22.901 --> 01:20:25.903
No, I'm not fooling. No, we're not coming.

01:20:26.738 --> 01:20:28.364
You heard me.

01:20:28.490 --> 01:20:31.992
Oh, I'm sure you went
to a lot of trouble in cooking it.

01:20:32.953 --> 01:20:36.121
Yeah, it sounds swell. A roast, eh?

01:20:36.248 --> 01:20:39.583
- Bark.
- Uh...uh, wait a minute, Nellie.

01:20:39.709 --> 01:20:43.337
- Maybe we should...
- Excuse me, young lady. This is private.

01:20:46.132 --> 01:20:48.050
(No audible dialogue)

01:21:02.691 --> 01:21:05.734
- Was it all right?
- She took it very nicely.

01:21:05.861 --> 01:21:08.028
Shall we join the others?

01:21:10.532 --> 01:21:12.533
(Orchestra plays dramatic music)

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:19.748
- So, you're having dinner with us.
- Yeah, we thought we would.

01:21:19.875 --> 01:21:22.751
That's fine. Step right upstairs.
I'll be in to see you later.

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.587
Thank you very much.

01:21:47.027 --> 01:21:49.820
Better hurry along with your drink.
Your husband and I are one up on you.

01:21:49.946 --> 01:21:53.657
Oh, well, you go right ahead.
I kind of like to dawdle.

01:21:53.783 --> 01:21:56.577
- Are you having a good time, Lucy?
- Oh, yes, Bark.

01:21:56.703 --> 01:22:00.706
You wouldn't think, would you, to look at
her, that she was a mother of five children?

01:22:00.832 --> 01:22:03.000
- Not really.
- She's a grandmother too.

01:22:03.126 --> 01:22:06.003
Oh ! Well, that I just can't believe.

01:22:06.129 --> 01:22:08.297
It's kind of hard for me to believe.

01:22:08.423 --> 01:22:12.301
- Fifty years go by pretty fast.
- Only when you're happy.

01:22:12.427 --> 01:22:14.053
- How many children have you?
- Five of 'em.

01:22:14.179 --> 01:22:17.014
Really? I'll bet they've brought you
a lot of pleasure.

01:22:18.558 --> 01:22:21.685
- I'll bet you haven't any children.
- Don't you pay any attention to him.

01:22:21.811 --> 01:22:25.064
Then I'm sure it was Mrs Cooper
who made the 50 years go so swiftly.

01:22:25.190 --> 01:22:27.483
- Oh, that's very nice.
- Yes, it was.

01:22:27.609 --> 01:22:29.568
Best thing I ever did, marrying her.

01:22:30.695 --> 01:22:32.613
Randy Dunlap was courting her
at the same time that I was.

01:22:32.739 --> 01:22:36.325
- Oh, Bark. Will you stop that?
- He was. He proposed to you, didn't he?

01:22:36.451 --> 01:22:38.535
Yes, he did, but you don't have to tell it.

01:22:38.662 --> 01:22:42.414
I guess I looked like the best bet
so she took me.

01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:44.750
- Randy Dunlap's the banker in our town.
- Really?

01:22:44.876 --> 01:22:48.337
- I got his girl, but he's got my house.
- You do go on !

01:22:49.631 --> 01:22:51.799
Well, if you'll pardon me.
We've enjoyed having you.

01:22:51.925 --> 01:22:53.592
- Yeah.
- Next time, don't stay away so long.

01:22:53.718 --> 01:22:55.761
- Goodbye, Mr Norton.
- Mrs Cooper.

01:22:59.808 --> 01:23:01.266
(Low chatter)

01:23:01.393 --> 01:23:03.227
(Orchestra playing waltz)

01:23:05.939 --> 01:23:11.443
You know, Lucy, I often wonder what I'd do
if I was a young fella nowadays.

01:23:11.569 --> 01:23:13.612
I guess I'd have to be a bachelor.

01:23:13.738 --> 01:23:17.408
There are no girls around
a man would want to take a second look at.

01:23:17.534 --> 01:23:20.244
Oh, shucks, Bark.
There are plenty of mighty pretty girls.

01:23:20.370 --> 01:23:22.204
Not as pretty as you. And you know what?

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:24.873
You've held your looks
better than anyone I know.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:26.250
Ah.

01:23:26.376 --> 01:23:31.839
Right now I don't see any girl
that looks half as nice to me as you do.

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:36.343
Bark, you're sweet.

01:23:36.469 --> 01:23:38.095
So are you.

01:23:51.317 --> 01:23:55.529
You know, the more I think of it,
the fella who wrote that poem...

01:23:55.655 --> 01:23:58.449
- You know, your favourite?
- Mm-hm.

01:23:58.575 --> 01:24:02.369
I think he must have got
a peek into our future.

01:24:02.495 --> 01:24:08.167
You know, the poem in the book where
you marked the place with a rosebud?

01:24:09.627 --> 01:24:11.795
Or did the bank get that too?

01:24:11.921 --> 01:24:15.466
They took the book,
but they couldn't take the poem from me.

01:24:17.510 --> 01:24:24.725
A man and a maid stood hand in hand
Bound by a tiny wedding band.

01:24:25.852 --> 01:24:33.233
Before them lay the uncertain years
That promised joy and maybe tears.

01:24:33.359 --> 01:24:36.987
"Is she afraid?"
Thought the man of the maid.

01:24:38.782 --> 01:24:46.205
"Darling," he said in a tender voice
"Tell me, do you regret your choice?

01:24:46.331 --> 01:24:52.252
"We know not where the road may wind
Or what strange byways we may find.

01:24:52.378 --> 01:24:56.673
"Are you afraid?" said the man to the maid.

01:24:58.802 --> 01:25:02.721
She raised her eyes and spoke at last.

01:25:02.847 --> 01:25:05.557
"My dear," she said, "the die is cast.

01:25:05.683 --> 01:25:09.436
"The vows have been spoken.
The rice has been thrown.

01:25:09.562 --> 01:25:13.607
"Into the future we'll travel alone.

01:25:15.527 --> 01:25:20.823
"With you," said the maid, "I'm not afraid."

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:27.371
Would you like to dance, Bark?

01:25:27.497 --> 01:25:30.082
- Huh?
- It's a waltz.

01:25:45.181 --> 01:25:48.183
(Tune ends)

01:25:49.144 --> 01:25:52.146
(Upbeat tune)

01:26:04.951 --> 01:26:07.953
(Tune ends)

01:26:10.456 --> 01:26:13.458
(♪ Let Me Call You Sweetheart)

01:26:40.445 --> 01:26:41.862
Good evening, everybody.

01:26:41.988 --> 01:26:46.241
This is Carlton Gorman coming to you
from the Vogard Hotel in New York City.

01:26:46.367 --> 01:26:50.871
It's nine o'clock. It's now nine o'clock,
and is everybody happy?

01:26:50.997 --> 01:26:53.415
Smile, and the world smiles with you, folks.

01:26:57.212 --> 01:26:58.629
Goodbye.

01:27:01.591 --> 01:27:03.425
The evening's fun is about to start,

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:06.595
and you can't go wrong
with a song in your heart.

01:27:16.189 --> 01:27:19.107
♪ Let me call you sweetheart

01:27:19.234 --> 01:27:24.279
♪ I'm in love with you

01:27:24.405 --> 01:27:31.286
♪ Let me hear you whisper
That you love me too...

01:27:31.412 --> 01:27:32.704
(Whispers) I love you too.

01:27:32.830 --> 01:27:41.588
♪ Keep the love light glowing
In your eyes so blue

01:27:41.714 --> 01:27:45.884
(Both) ♪ Let me call you sweetheart

01:27:46.010 --> 01:27:49.721
♪ I'm in love

01:27:49.847 --> 01:27:52.808
♪With you ♪

01:27:57.188 --> 01:28:00.399
(Chuckles) Oh. That's funny, isn't it?

01:28:00.525 --> 01:28:01.942
We've known all along that we're probably

01:28:02.068 --> 01:28:04.194
the most good-for-nothing bunch of kids
who were ever raised,

01:28:04.320 --> 01:28:07.572
but it didn't bother us much
until we found out that Pop knew it too.

01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:10.409
Doesn't look as though
they're even coming by.

01:28:10.535 --> 01:28:11.618
No, I don't think so.

01:28:11.744 --> 01:28:14.538
Well, we ought to be getting to the station.
How much time have we got?

01:28:14.664 --> 01:28:16.164
- About a minute and a half.
- (Cora and Nellie) What?

01:28:16.291 --> 01:28:18.917
- Well, two minutes maybe.
- Two minutes?

01:28:19.043 --> 01:28:22.504
Why on earth didn't you tell us?
That wasn't a very nice thing to do, George.

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:26.383
I think so. I kind of thought
they'd like to be alone.

01:28:26.509 --> 01:28:29.928
But if we don't go to the station,
they'll think we're terrible.

01:28:30.054 --> 01:28:33.348
- Aren't we?
- You're tellin' us right, brother.

01:28:40.523 --> 01:28:43.567
I can't understand
what happened to the children.

01:28:44.736 --> 01:28:46.903
Right here.

01:28:47.030 --> 01:28:50.032
Well, I...I guess this is it.

01:28:50.158 --> 01:28:52.326
- It looks like a very nice train.
- Uh-huh.

01:28:53.578 --> 01:28:55.746
I hear they serve very good food on trains.

01:28:55.872 --> 01:28:57.289
(Bell rings)

01:28:58.541 --> 01:29:03.920
Well, give Addie my love,
and tell her to take good care of you.

01:29:04.047 --> 01:29:06.381
Well, you'll very likely
see her soon yourself.

01:29:06.507 --> 01:29:09.926
I'll get a job out there,
and I'll send for you right away.

01:29:10.053 --> 01:29:13.889
I don't doubt that, Bark.
You'll get a job. Of course you will.

01:29:14.015 --> 01:29:16.683
- (Conductor) All aboard.
- They didn't give us much time, did they?

01:29:16.809 --> 01:29:19.728
- Goodbye, Lucy dear.
- Goodbye, darling.

01:29:23.232 --> 01:29:26.360
In case I don't see you again...

01:29:26.486 --> 01:29:28.904
- What?
- Well, anything might happen.

01:29:29.030 --> 01:29:32.199
The train could jump off the track.

01:29:32.325 --> 01:29:35.243
If it should happen
that I don't see you again,

01:29:35.370 --> 01:29:39.247
it's been very nice knowing you,
Miss Breckenridge.

01:29:39.374 --> 01:29:43.001
Bark, that's probably
the prettiest speech you ever made.

01:29:44.670 --> 01:29:46.880
And in case I don't see you a...

01:29:47.006 --> 01:29:50.342
(Clears throat) Well, for a little while.

01:29:50.468 --> 01:29:54.763
I just want to tell you, it's been lovely.

01:29:54.889 --> 01:29:56.807
Every bit of it.

01:29:56.933 --> 01:29:58.934
The whole 50 years.

01:30:01.020 --> 01:30:05.732
I'd sooner have been your wife, Bark,
than anyone else on earth.

01:30:05.858 --> 01:30:08.151
Oh, thank you, Lucy.

01:30:08.277 --> 01:30:10.112
(Conductor) All aboard !

01:30:11.989 --> 01:30:13.824
Get going, Pa.

01:30:22.375 --> 01:30:24.000
