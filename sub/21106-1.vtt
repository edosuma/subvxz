01:45.840 --> 01:47.683
- Hello, Jerzyk.
- Good morning, Miss.

01:47.880 --> 01:49.211
It's a beautiful day.

01:58.880 --> 02:00.960
Good morning.

02:01.040 --> 02:03.327
- Hello. Welcome.
- Good morning.

02:04.800 --> 02:06.370
Good morning. Enjoy yourselves today.

02:07.120 --> 02:08.121
Good morning.

02:12.920 --> 02:14.410
Good morning.

02:15.720 --> 02:17.245
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

02:24.080 --> 02:26.890
Come along, Adam. Time for morning rounds.

02:44.400 --> 02:46.641
Hello, my loves.

02:48.880 --> 02:50.041
Good morning, sweetheart.

02:56.320 --> 02:57.321
Good morning.

03:34.200 --> 03:35.640
How's our girl today?

03:35.720 --> 03:37.085
No problems today, Miss.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.800
Hello, old Kasia.

03:43.880 --> 03:47.080
Yes. Tembo.

03:47.160 --> 03:49.162
What a beautiful girl you are.

04:08.880 --> 04:10.962
Good morning.

04:25.880 --> 04:28.531
- Good morning, darling.
- Good morning, Punia.

04:30.760 --> 04:31.841
Have you come to help me?

05:09.840 --> 05:12.120
The torchlight was flaring in front of me.

05:12.200 --> 05:14.840
Behind me, I could hear the breathing
of a maddened creature.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.526
It was midnight, black as coal.

05:18.200 --> 05:22.440
I couldn't see my hand in front of me,
but I could feel her breath on my neck.

05:22.520 --> 05:24.880
Hot and thick.

05:24.960 --> 05:27.691
I had interfered, and she was angry with me.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.244
She took two steps.

05:32.040 --> 05:34.320
I thought it was the end of me.

05:34.400 --> 05:38.000
I took my rifle, raised it,

05:38.080 --> 05:39.720
and that's when she charged.

05:43.840 --> 05:46.810
There was nothing I could do,
I had to shoot her.

05:48.040 --> 05:50.240
It was the picture of perfection.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.810
An exquisite creature.

05:52.880 --> 05:54.769
A great desecration for me.

05:54.960 --> 05:58.567
But I have to say, her cubs did survive.

05:59.120 --> 06:03.603
They thrived, and have grown to
a proud maturity in my zoo. Cheers.

06:04.240 --> 06:07.244
Herr Heck has taken over
the Berlin Zoo from his father.

06:07.480 --> 06:09.200
And his brother runs the Munich Zoo.

06:09.280 --> 06:11.040
Would you like a canapé, Herr Heck?

06:11.120 --> 06:12.960
It looks delicious, but no. Thank you.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.720
This is Magda Gross, the sculptress.
Perhaps you know of her.

06:15.800 --> 06:16.760
Indeed, yes.

06:16.840 --> 06:18.683
- She also made this...
- Oh!

06:20.120 --> 06:21.121
Excuse me.

06:21.920 --> 06:24.120
And what do you do with yourself, my dear,

06:24.200 --> 06:26.043
while your husband is playing
with his monkeys?

06:28.240 --> 06:29.480
I help him.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.440
Oh, isn't that sweet.

06:31.520 --> 06:33.560
Sweetness is the least of it.

06:33.640 --> 06:35.840
Antonina's a magician.

06:35.920 --> 06:39.560
Thank you. I'll take it.

06:39.640 --> 06:41.920
We met five or six years ago,
didn't we, Frau Zabińska?

06:42.000 --> 06:43.000
Mmm.

06:43.080 --> 06:44.560
I think you've changed your hair.

06:44.640 --> 06:45.721
Yes.

06:45.840 --> 06:48.486
You've only grown more beautiful
in these past years, I have to say.

06:48.640 --> 06:51.007
The look of a stray barn cat, if you ask me.

06:51.840 --> 06:55.560
Did you know that barn cats have
the keenest sense in all of nature?

06:55.640 --> 06:58.405
More astute and fine than
any human being I hope to meet.

07:01.200 --> 07:03.760
Do you play the piano, Frau Zabińska?

07:03.840 --> 07:05.251
A little.

07:05.360 --> 07:06.725
Why don't you play something for us?

07:07.600 --> 07:12.205
I think it's the perfect time to
soothe the savage beast and all that.

07:17.200 --> 07:18.929
Maybe she should play a German waltz.

07:19.400 --> 07:21.801
We may all be learning
the goose-step within a year.

07:21.960 --> 07:23.960
- Stefan, please.
- Isn't that so, Herr Heck?

07:24.040 --> 07:25.280
Not now, please, Stefan.

07:25.520 --> 07:28.683
Well, Hitler wants Poland.

07:28.800 --> 07:30.440
It's what everyone's saying.

07:30.520 --> 07:33.440
I wouldn't know anything
about it, I assure you.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.000
I'm a zoologist, not a politician.

07:50.960 --> 07:53.725
Mama, Jerzyk needs you! It's Kasia.

07:54.600 --> 07:56.045
Excuse me, everyone.

07:58.400 --> 08:00.402
Be quiet, don't startle her.

08:08.560 --> 08:12.246
Here, stay here.
Hold the light steady for me.

08:21.760 --> 08:23.762
She's not breathing.

08:27.400 --> 08:29.920
I'm here, Kasia.

08:30.000 --> 08:32.400
I'm here.

08:32.679 --> 08:33.681
Hello, Tembo.

08:35.799 --> 08:36.960
Hello, Tembo.

08:37.039 --> 08:40.361
I can bring you overalls, Miss, please.
I can find other men.

08:40.799 --> 08:42.802
There's no time. She's suffocating.

08:43.280 --> 08:45.400
Let me help you, Kasia.

08:45.480 --> 08:47.960
Please, let me help you, my darling.

08:48.320 --> 08:50.200
Let me help you, sweetheart.

08:50.280 --> 08:52.089
I have no rifle, Miss, please!

08:52.320 --> 08:53.526
Hush! Enough now!

08:57.200 --> 08:58.326
Please.

09:00.320 --> 09:01.606
Oh, she's blocked!

09:08.240 --> 09:10.129
No, please, let me do this.

09:10.760 --> 09:13.445
I'm trying, Kasia. I'm trying, my darling.

09:28.080 --> 09:29.320
Wait, wait, wait.

09:29.400 --> 09:30.925
- You should go. You can go.
- Why isn't that man armed?

09:35.320 --> 09:36.840
Whoa, Tembo.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.206
- What's his name?
- Tembo.

09:38.840 --> 09:42.003
Tembo! Tembo. Good. Good, good, good.

09:45.320 --> 09:47.687
We're losing her! Jerzyk, help me!

09:53.240 --> 09:55.440
Push, Jerzyk!

09:55.520 --> 09:56.726
Push!

09:58.640 --> 10:00.005
Go. Go, go, go.

10:06.120 --> 10:07.121
Oh!

10:11.480 --> 10:13.562
Oh, she's breathing!

10:14.640 --> 10:16.563
Oh! She's breathing!

10:21.680 --> 10:23.091
You beauty!

10:26.240 --> 10:28.527
She's beautiful!

10:29.960 --> 10:32.486
Amazing! Amazing!

10:35.920 --> 10:38.082
That was hard work, wasn't it?

10:42.040 --> 10:46.125
It's all right. It's all right, sweetheart.

11:04.760 --> 11:06.330
You are a, um...

11:08.160 --> 11:12.609
You are a wonder, Punia.
You are Eve in her garden.

11:27.400 --> 11:28.686
It's late. Let's go home.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.240
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

11:39.320 --> 11:41.322
Let's go! We're going.

11:53.240 --> 11:56.881
Mama, what are those men doing?
They look like mules.

12:06.400 --> 12:08.641
We were on Nalewki Street today.

12:09.760 --> 12:13.242
They're working the Jews
like pack animals now.

12:16.400 --> 12:20.166
I think you should take Rys
out of Warsaw tomorrow.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.729
But where will we go?

12:25.480 --> 12:29.200
You could stay with my cousins in Zalesie.

12:29.280 --> 12:31.040
Things are too uncertain here.

12:31.120 --> 12:35.040
We should get Rys
out of the city while we can.

12:35.120 --> 12:38.283
But school's about to start.

12:38.400 --> 12:42.120
Oh, he's so excited, Jan,
with his new pencils, and his shoes...

12:42.200 --> 12:46.330
You're not listening to me.
I'm trying to tell you something.

12:48.120 --> 12:50.600
It's feeling very dangerous to me right now.

12:55.240 --> 12:57.920
What about you?

12:58.000 --> 13:02.761
I have to stay for the animals,
but I'll come as soon as I can.

13:17.920 --> 13:21.960
Punia, Hitler and Stalin have signed a pact.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.724
Only Poland sits in the middle.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.360
People are leaving.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.640
We could stay in Zalesie for a little while,

13:29.720 --> 13:33.520
but if war comes, we have to find
a way out of the country.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.320
I don't want to run away.

13:35.400 --> 13:39.564
I don't want to carry Rys from place
to place, like a frightened cat.

13:42.240 --> 13:44.641
This is his home.

13:45.960 --> 13:49.840
I'm sorry, Punia. Come back to me, come here.

13:49.920 --> 13:52.920
People always want to run when
they don't know what's coming.

13:53.000 --> 13:57.160
It's their first instinct, always to run.

13:57.240 --> 14:00.880
- Come.
- It's not good for a child.

14:00.960 --> 14:04.560
It's not good, Jan, I'm telling you.

14:04.640 --> 14:07.883
I don't want Rys to live that way.

14:11.920 --> 14:14.605
Please, I want to stay here.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.286
In Warsaw.

14:22.000 --> 14:23.081
All right.

14:53.720 --> 14:56.451
Rys? Rys!

15:02.720 --> 15:04.563
Look at all the planes!

15:05.640 --> 15:07.369
Let's go inside.

15:33.280 --> 15:35.169
- But where's Papa?
- He's in Płońsk.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.280
We'll meet him in Zalesie.

15:37.360 --> 15:38.885
What about Pancho?

15:39.200 --> 15:41.200
Quick, pack your things!

15:41.280 --> 15:43.520
- No, Rys, leave him!
- No, I don't want to.

15:43.600 --> 15:44.761
- We'll open the doors.
- He's scared.

15:44.880 --> 15:47.884
He'll run somewhere safe. Let's go!

15:56.800 --> 15:58.086
Mama!

16:01.080 --> 16:04.240
Evacuate the zoo immediately!

16:05.440 --> 16:08.728
This is the Polish Army.
Wild animals are loose.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.960
Emergency! Emergency!

16:12.040 --> 16:14.008
Evacuate now!

16:14.320 --> 16:17.360
Take the boy, Miss, please! Go, go!

16:25.280 --> 16:27.880
No! Don't shoot him, don't shoot him!

16:27.960 --> 16:29.000
No!

16:29.080 --> 16:31.200
No, Mama!

17:38.520 --> 17:41.171
Excuse me, where is the train to Zalesie?

17:44.480 --> 17:46.881
No trains running today!

17:47.000 --> 17:52.166
No trains today!
Leave the station immediately.

18:09.320 --> 18:10.321
Papa!

18:11.680 --> 18:13.080
Antonina!

18:13.160 --> 18:14.400
Rys, Rys, come, come, come.

18:14.480 --> 18:15.641
Papa!

18:18.840 --> 18:19.921
I thought you were lost.

18:20.920 --> 18:22.400
Come, come. Come.

18:22.480 --> 18:23.560
I can't believe you found us.

18:23.640 --> 18:25.563
Let's go home.

18:49.040 --> 18:52.249
Hey. Maybe you'd like to fly. Come.

19:04.240 --> 19:05.651
Come, Punia.

20:05.200 --> 20:06.201
Pancho!

20:17.640 --> 20:20.720
Pancho, I'm here.

20:20.800 --> 20:22.006
It's all right.

20:32.160 --> 20:34.447
He's all right, Mama.

21:10.000 --> 21:14.562
Oh, you poor things.
You must have been so scared.

21:20.280 --> 21:23.769
The German government has taken
charge of the Polish people.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.280
We rely on the population of Warsaw

21:27.360 --> 21:30.200
to accept the entry of German forces

21:30.280 --> 21:33.762
quietly, honorably, and calmly.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.325
They're here, Mama.

21:59.280 --> 22:00.805
Let's go.

22:05.560 --> 22:08.086
They're using our enclosures as an armory.

22:09.160 --> 22:12.482
The country's completely overrun.

22:12.600 --> 22:13.761
I was raised with these people.

22:15.760 --> 22:17.410
Jews, Gentiles.

22:17.800 --> 22:20.644
It didn't matter to my family.
It never mattered to me.

22:39.960 --> 22:41.610
Guten Tag, meine Herren.

22:51.640 --> 22:53.400
Herr Heck.

22:53.480 --> 22:55.280
Thank you, Jerzyk.

22:55.360 --> 22:56.840
Hello.

22:56.920 --> 22:58.285
It's terrible, Frau Zabińska.

22:58.960 --> 23:02.806
Yes. It is.

23:04.880 --> 23:07.480
You know, we weren't expecting you.

23:07.560 --> 23:10.006
I'm so sorry. My husband's not here, so...

23:10.520 --> 23:11.646
Can we talk?

23:13.120 --> 23:16.124
Yes, of course. Please.

23:40.000 --> 23:44.050
Your zoo is to be liquidated.
I'm sorry to tell you.

23:47.120 --> 23:50.283
I don't understand what you mean.

23:51.800 --> 23:54.800
For the war effort.

23:54.880 --> 23:57.531
Meat, firewood,

23:57.680 --> 23:59.409
- soap...
- No.

24:05.440 --> 24:08.364
No. It can't be true.

24:09.360 --> 24:10.361
The animals?

24:12.600 --> 24:14.320
All of them?

24:14.400 --> 24:16.368
Another tragedy, I know.

24:18.800 --> 24:23.488
But I see a way out of this, my friend.

24:24.360 --> 24:26.520
That's why I've come.

24:26.600 --> 24:28.920
But you need to listen to me now.
You need to trust me.

24:29.000 --> 24:31.651
Now, I could take your prize animals
to Germany as a loan.

24:32.280 --> 24:35.320
We'll give them sanctuary.

24:35.400 --> 24:37.160
You know you can trust my word on this.

24:37.240 --> 24:39.242
And when the war is over,
I can return them to you.

24:40.040 --> 24:44.160
But what if the war comes to Germany?

24:44.240 --> 24:47.160
A terrible thought, I know,
and a personal nightmare for me,

24:47.240 --> 24:50.480
but I must tell you
the Allied forces are very weak.

24:50.560 --> 24:52.403
I expect this to be over very soon.

24:53.920 --> 24:56.680
I want to rescue the best of your breeds.

24:56.760 --> 24:59.360
And I can secure them a future
no matter what might come.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.807
And we can do this together, Frau Zabińska.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.323
We can save your animals together.

25:06.440 --> 25:08.000
What do you think?

25:08.080 --> 25:09.411
Yes.

25:12.280 --> 25:14.169
Of course we must do it.

25:14.280 --> 25:16.840
I'll bring trucks as soon as I can.

25:16.920 --> 25:19.764
Your animals will be fine.
I give you my word.

25:24.240 --> 25:26.811
I don't know how to thank you.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.961
It's from one animal lover to another, hmm?

25:33.440 --> 25:34.566
What do you mean?

25:35.360 --> 25:37.480
Lutz Heck is taking all the animals?

25:37.560 --> 25:42.000
No, just the prize stock, for safekeeping.

25:42.080 --> 25:44.120
Ah, but that's our stock, Punia.

25:44.200 --> 25:46.487
That's all that's left to keep
the zoo in operation.

25:47.440 --> 25:50.523
Why didn't he wait to speak to me?

25:51.840 --> 25:54.491
He said he didn't have time.

25:57.120 --> 25:59.487
Jan, he wants to help.

26:01.960 --> 26:03.800
So, I gave him our permission.

26:03.880 --> 26:06.720
He doesn't need our permission, Punia.

26:06.800 --> 26:10.771
Don't you see? He's Hitler's head zoologist.

26:10.880 --> 26:12.769
Lutz Heck controls our zoo.

26:30.840 --> 26:33.440
My God!

26:33.520 --> 26:35.960
- Beautiful.
- Jerzyk, wait. Wait, please.

26:41.520 --> 26:43.249
Stay safe, my beauty.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.562
Put him in Herr Heck's truck.

27:09.800 --> 27:10.881
Come.

27:13.680 --> 27:15.364
Thank you, Jan.

27:15.880 --> 27:17.325
Goodbye, Frau Zabińska.

27:44.880 --> 27:46.160
"The rich shoemaker in the town

27:46.240 --> 27:50.280
"took the measure
of the little foot into his own room

27:50.360 --> 27:55.526
"in which stood great glass
cases full of pretty shoes.

27:56.200 --> 28:00.000
"She sat down and made,
well, as well as she could,

28:00.080 --> 28:02.520
"a pair of little..." Ah!

28:02.600 --> 28:06.400
I think Papa's home in time
for New Year's Eve.

28:17.280 --> 28:18.361
Happy New Year, gentlemen.

28:23.280 --> 28:25.040
Is this absolutely necessary?

28:25.120 --> 28:26.121
Yeah.

28:27.440 --> 28:30.080
Stop! What are you doing?

28:30.160 --> 28:31.240
These creatures won't survive the winter.

28:31.320 --> 28:33.971
It's an order from high command.
There's nothing I can do.

28:34.440 --> 28:35.487
No, stop!

28:38.600 --> 28:41.680
Mama! Mama, who's shooting?

28:41.760 --> 28:44.491
Mama, they're shooting! Who's shooting?

28:49.160 --> 28:50.650
Make it stop.

29:02.200 --> 29:04.851
- Tell me, where's the owner?
- He's gone.

29:05.520 --> 29:07.249
Would you tell his wife
I'd like to talk to her?

29:10.480 --> 29:11.925
They left on holiday.

29:15.800 --> 29:18.326
I thought I saw her.
I must have been mistaken.

29:39.600 --> 29:41.887
Have it stuffed and mounted.

30:17.560 --> 30:19.280
Keep moving, children.

30:19.360 --> 30:22.000
- Dr. Korczak.
- That's right.

30:22.080 --> 30:23.650
- Dr. Korczak?
- Not too far now.

30:26.320 --> 30:27.731
Not too far now.

30:52.960 --> 30:54.800
They're forcing Jews out of their homes,

30:54.880 --> 30:56.530
and they are taking us all to the ghetto.

30:57.920 --> 31:00.685
They dragged Maurycy away
like he was a criminal.

31:01.920 --> 31:04.764
That brilliant, kind man,
like he was nothing.

31:06.800 --> 31:09.770
We're going to go where they
want us to go, that's all.

31:12.040 --> 31:14.088
And when the war is over,

31:15.360 --> 31:17.681
we'll come home again.

31:22.400 --> 31:24.600
I've known you since we were boys, Jan.

31:24.680 --> 31:27.923
Go on, Szymon. What do you need from me?

31:28.440 --> 31:30.920
I'd like to keep my insect
collection here with you.

31:31.000 --> 31:32.920
I can't take it with me.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.720
I want it to be safe.
It's my life's work, you know that.

31:35.800 --> 31:40.240
Of course, Szymon, yes.
We can put it in the basement.

31:40.320 --> 31:43.802
It's dry there, like a dungeon.
And no one will find it.

31:46.680 --> 31:50.002
Thank you, Jan. Thank you.

31:55.160 --> 31:57.242
We have room.

31:58.280 --> 32:00.760
We have the storeroom upstairs.

32:00.840 --> 32:03.366
We could hide Magda there.

32:07.160 --> 32:08.446
Antonina.

32:13.640 --> 32:16.440
This is a human being.

32:16.520 --> 32:18.568
This is a Jew hiding in our house.

32:19.680 --> 32:22.480
We can't even give her a glass of water.

32:22.560 --> 32:25.000
- Do you understand that?
- Mmm.

32:25.080 --> 32:28.004
We could be shot for a glass of water.

32:36.280 --> 32:39.204
So, we just close our eyes and let her go.

32:41.160 --> 32:43.606
Our dearest friend in all the world.

32:46.880 --> 32:49.087
We would have to be sure about this.

32:51.000 --> 32:53.480
Think carefully because...

32:56.720 --> 32:58.609
We'd have to be very sure.

33:06.720 --> 33:09.405
Absolutely no sound during the morning.

33:09.760 --> 33:12.286
No sound, do you understand me?

33:13.240 --> 33:15.720
- The cook leaves at 1:00.
- She'll sleep in the day.

33:19.000 --> 33:24.484
At midnight, the patrol leaves,
and then you can come out.

33:26.520 --> 33:28.170
How long can I stay?

33:29.400 --> 33:32.600
I have nowhere else to go.

33:32.680 --> 33:35.286
You'll stay till it's over.

33:42.280 --> 33:43.281
It's done.

33:44.920 --> 33:48.925
They've moved all the Jews behind
walls in the Nalewki District.

33:50.040 --> 33:52.040
And they're bringing in very little food.

33:52.120 --> 33:55.442
- Oh, my God.
- And no wood, nothing for the cold.

33:58.920 --> 34:01.200
Have you heard anything about Maurycy?

34:01.280 --> 34:04.720
He's practicing law from a storefront.
That's all I know.

34:04.800 --> 34:07.531
I can't get through the gates, Magda.

34:07.960 --> 34:11.009
No one enters the ghetto without a pass.

34:15.080 --> 34:17.600
Listen,

34:17.679 --> 34:19.880
there are people I know,

34:19.960 --> 34:22.400
people trying to help.

34:22.480 --> 34:25.040
They have trucks, they have guns.

34:25.120 --> 34:27.520
And they want to use
the zoo as a way station.

34:27.600 --> 34:29.045
What do you mean?

34:30.159 --> 34:33.562
A place to hide Jews, until safe
houses can be found for them.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.804
A friend is different, one friend.

34:39.520 --> 34:43.440
But more than one? That's dangerous, Jan.
You said it yourself.

34:43.520 --> 34:47.320
They're starving, Antonina.

34:47.400 --> 34:48.969
Two kilometers away.

34:49.639 --> 34:52.563
They are trapped and starving
like rats in a cellar.

34:57.680 --> 34:58.681
How many?

35:00.200 --> 35:01.326
Impossible to say.

35:01.760 --> 35:03.280
And for how long?

35:03.360 --> 35:05.761
They'd be our guests
until we found them refuge.

35:13.840 --> 35:15.205
A human zoo.

35:18.840 --> 35:22.760
We have to keep the grounds
in operation, or we're lost.

35:22.840 --> 35:27.964
But whatever it is, whatever we do,
we have to hide it in plain sight.

36:11.760 --> 36:14.969
We understand the war office
is going to close our zoo.

36:15.080 --> 36:19.210
An unfortunate consequence
of the occupation. I'm really sorry.

36:19.640 --> 36:22.640
Well, of course we want to save it if we can.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.440
We've spent many years building it.

36:25.520 --> 36:26.880
I'm sure you understand.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.600
I do.

36:28.680 --> 36:30.569
What do you propose, Frau Zabińska?

36:32.000 --> 36:33.843
A pig farm, Herr Heck.

36:35.080 --> 36:36.161
A pig farm?

36:41.320 --> 36:43.607
- Is this a joke?
- No.

36:43.720 --> 36:45.529
Your men are hungry.

36:45.640 --> 36:49.080
Your officers, they need meat.

36:49.160 --> 36:52.160
Uh, we need to keep
the zoo in operation, Lutz.

36:52.240 --> 36:54.720
We'll raise pigs in the pens
to feed your men,

36:54.800 --> 36:57.485
and we will save our zoo.

37:00.680 --> 37:04.685
Pigs. Well, they're cheap to farm,
of course, but how would you feed them?

37:06.360 --> 37:08.840
We could collect garbage from the ghetto.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.325
Of course, with your permission.

37:12.120 --> 37:14.480
I certainly see your point.

37:14.560 --> 37:17.006
Your zoo's been of value. That's very true.

37:17.480 --> 37:21.326
Your bison was exquisite.
A perfect specimen, and a terrible loss.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.000
I've spoken of it to Hermann Göring,

37:25.080 --> 37:27.280
and I'm happy to say
that he's agreed with me.

37:27.360 --> 37:29.647
I am to start a breeding program this summer.

37:30.920 --> 37:32.360
You're going to breed bison?

37:32.440 --> 37:37.651
No, that plan has no scope, no ambition.

37:38.320 --> 37:42.882
No, I intend to breed
aurochsen from the bison.

37:44.280 --> 37:47.045
Aurochsen. But...

37:49.280 --> 37:52.760
But they have been extinct
for 300 years, Lutz.

37:52.840 --> 37:54.560
They're storybook creatures now.

37:54.640 --> 37:57.849
That's exactly the point.
I intend to bring them back.

37:57.960 --> 37:59.166
That's not possible.

38:03.360 --> 38:06.330
I didn't know that you thought
so little of me, Dr. Zabiński.

38:09.120 --> 38:11.280
I devoted my life to the study of genetics,

38:11.360 --> 38:14.960
and I'm well practiced
in the study of animal breeding.

38:15.040 --> 38:16.720
I'm an expert in that field.

38:16.800 --> 38:20.960
And I think I know more than anyone.

38:21.040 --> 38:22.246
Even more than you.

38:27.400 --> 38:30.244
Herr Göring must respect you very much.

38:30.680 --> 38:32.887
Oh, I believe he does, yes.

38:34.920 --> 38:37.890
Well... I think the pigs will work.

38:40.080 --> 38:42.840
I'm sure Göring will be
pleased with the idea.

38:42.920 --> 38:47.160
And what an irony,
a trayf farm fed by Jewish garbage.

38:47.240 --> 38:50.164
And right under their noses.

38:52.240 --> 38:53.241
Cheers!

39:15.560 --> 39:17.483
- Hello, Lutz. What's this?
- Jan.

39:17.760 --> 39:20.120
Draw them into the pen, and close the gate!

39:20.200 --> 39:22.567
But be careful, he's in a temper.

39:27.280 --> 39:28.760
You're breeding them here?

39:28.840 --> 39:29.966
They require a natural habitat.

39:30.880 --> 39:33.200
We thought of your zoo,
but we had to fight the war office.

39:33.280 --> 39:36.360
And then you came knocking on my door,
as if you could read my mind.

39:36.440 --> 39:38.360
You paved the way with pigs.

39:40.080 --> 39:42.321
What a crack-brained idea,
and what splendid luck for us!

39:46.320 --> 39:48.527
I'll work with him.

39:50.520 --> 39:53.888
We can keep our eye on him
with the bison here.

39:57.320 --> 40:00.324
Well, he trusts you, that's clear.

40:02.480 --> 40:05.290
You have a way with him.

40:07.240 --> 40:10.528
I don't know how I can ask you to do this.

40:13.080 --> 40:14.445
Then don't ask me.

40:15.800 --> 40:19.088
I'm going to do it, that's all.

40:38.280 --> 40:41.170
The feed's ready for the pigs. I have to go.

40:41.520 --> 40:42.726
See you later, darling.

40:57.720 --> 41:00.041
Halt!

41:13.640 --> 41:14.846
It's the pig farmer of Warsaw.

41:21.640 --> 41:22.721
Up! Up!

42:37.240 --> 42:38.480
This looks good.

42:41.440 --> 42:42.441
This is fine.

42:45.760 --> 42:46.761
Zabiński!

42:49.000 --> 42:50.126
Excuse me.

43:00.000 --> 43:03.447
It's pig meat. Put it away.

43:08.000 --> 43:11.880
So, how is Magda? Is she all right?

43:11.960 --> 43:15.400
Yes. She worries about you.

43:15.480 --> 43:17.528
What could I do? I had no choice.

43:18.440 --> 43:20.761
You can't hide this face.

43:26.720 --> 43:30.040
Uh... It's...

43:30.120 --> 43:32.407
It's worse than I realized.

43:33.680 --> 43:37.440
There's a young girl back there.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.729
It's a... a child.

43:43.040 --> 43:44.724
And two soldiers are with her.

43:44.880 --> 43:47.042
No one is safe.

43:48.960 --> 43:51.840
I don't know what will happen now.

43:51.920 --> 43:55.686
What do they intend to do with us, Jan?

43:57.880 --> 43:58.881
Thank you.

44:06.680 --> 44:07.886
Thank you.

44:12.040 --> 44:13.680
You must stop now, children.

44:13.760 --> 44:16.923
We need the peelings for our soup.

44:20.320 --> 44:23.240
- Dr. Korczak.
- I'm sorry, we have nothing else to eat.

44:23.320 --> 44:27.120
No, no, I should have realized.
Uh, may we speak privately?

44:27.240 --> 44:29.607
- I might be able to help you.
- Yes, of course.

44:47.280 --> 44:50.409
It's pig meat. I'll bring more when I can.

44:56.960 --> 44:57.961
I can get you out.

44:59.800 --> 45:03.600
People know your books.
They will take care of you.

45:03.720 --> 45:05.800
You should leave with me, Dr. Korczak.

45:05.880 --> 45:10.040
But then what of the children?

45:10.120 --> 45:12.360
What of them, Dr. Zabiński?

45:12.440 --> 45:14.647
My heart is no different than yours.

45:15.280 --> 45:19.649
I should not be here,
they should not be here,

45:19.760 --> 45:22.889
you should not be here.

45:39.360 --> 45:41.931
Go, go, go.

45:53.800 --> 45:55.165
Cover yourself.

46:14.440 --> 46:16.522
I can help you.
You have to be very, very quiet.

46:17.040 --> 46:18.485
Very quiet.

46:19.600 --> 46:22.280
Here, go in, go, go.

46:22.360 --> 46:23.920
Stay down.

46:24.000 --> 46:25.570
Good girl.

46:35.040 --> 46:36.769
Move over.

46:52.680 --> 46:54.091
Halt!

47:46.960 --> 47:48.769
Stay in, but listen.

47:51.120 --> 47:52.680
We will show you into a tunnel.

47:52.760 --> 47:53.807
And you will spend the night there.

47:54.400 --> 47:56.720
The German patrol comes back
shortly after dawn.

47:56.800 --> 48:00.280
But you will be woken before that
and taken outside of Warsaw.

48:01.520 --> 48:02.521
Understand?

48:02.960 --> 48:05.160
Go. Keep your heads down.

48:05.240 --> 48:08.400
Hurry. Through the tunnel.

48:08.480 --> 48:10.721
Through the tunnel. Go through the tunnel.

48:17.960 --> 48:19.485
Hello.

48:20.320 --> 48:21.401
Hey.

48:47.840 --> 48:49.842
There's a cook that comes every morning.

48:52.480 --> 48:54.608
Please, you can't make a sound.

49:02.240 --> 49:03.685
Will you tell me your name?

49:08.360 --> 49:10.362
Mine is Antonina.

49:13.360 --> 49:18.400
A new hiding place can feel strange.

49:19.640 --> 49:23.725
But I promise you,
you're going to be all right.

49:26.200 --> 49:28.202
I'll stay with you if you like.

49:40.160 --> 49:42.288
I'm right here.

49:53.760 --> 49:54.921
Now.

50:07.520 --> 50:08.646
Good work, Jan.

50:08.760 --> 50:11.366
- The army's waiting for them in Łomża.
- Good luck.

50:38.280 --> 50:41.400
If you tell me your family name,

50:41.480 --> 50:43.608
we can look for them.

50:45.000 --> 50:47.241
Maybe we could bring them here.

50:57.080 --> 51:00.448
What a terrible time you must have had.

51:08.800 --> 51:11.007
My father died.

51:14.840 --> 51:17.923
He was shot in St. Petersburg.

51:23.000 --> 51:24.161
I was...

51:27.000 --> 51:29.571
Me, I was about your age.

51:36.440 --> 51:39.569
We were taken in by friends sometimes,

51:43.160 --> 51:45.731
or by strangers.

51:50.640 --> 51:53.246
We were running for so long.

51:56.520 --> 52:01.287
And no one knows how hard it is,

52:05.240 --> 52:07.686
a life in hiding.

52:12.560 --> 52:15.643
You can never tell who your enemies are,

52:20.040 --> 52:21.451
or who to trust.

52:27.720 --> 52:31.566
Maybe that's why I love animals so much.

52:37.000 --> 52:39.606
You look in their eyes,

52:41.240 --> 52:44.084
and you know exactly what's in their hearts.

52:50.200 --> 52:51.770
They're not like people.

53:00.080 --> 53:01.764
We live in a zoo.

53:04.520 --> 53:05.646
That's where you are,

53:08.280 --> 53:10.806
in a zoo.

53:13.600 --> 53:16.922
Most of the animals are gone now
because of the bombing.

53:18.400 --> 53:20.050
But this one,

53:25.360 --> 53:27.567
she was left behind.

55:22.120 --> 55:23.121
Quiet.

55:41.000 --> 55:42.000
This way.

55:42.080 --> 55:44.680
Women and children
will stay here in the basement,

55:44.760 --> 55:47.684
until we can find a safe house
that can take you.

55:47.960 --> 55:49.246
We shall be possums now.

55:49.720 --> 55:51.802
We shall sleep in the mornings
when the cook is here.

55:53.600 --> 55:57.402
I will play my piano after midnight,
and then you'll know it's safe to come out.

55:57.760 --> 56:01.970
But if you hear the piano
in the day, you must hide.

58:00.320 --> 58:01.560
It's so cold today.

58:03.320 --> 58:05.402
Would you please make a double batch of soup?

58:37.200 --> 58:38.520
We'll mate them this summer.

58:38.600 --> 58:40.090
- Mmm-hmm.
- She'll be in estrus a short time.

58:40.240 --> 58:42.129
- Yes, a day at most.
- Exactly.

58:56.120 --> 58:59.806
Well, I'm afraid I've worn you out
with all our talk.

58:59.920 --> 59:04.323
Oh, not at all. I've enjoyed your company.

59:05.160 --> 59:06.161
Have you?

59:08.680 --> 59:09.886
Still, I think it's time to go.

01:00:02.040 --> 01:00:03.690
Goodbye, Antonina.

01:00:57.040 --> 01:00:59.560
We haven't much time, Mrs. Aszer.

01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:01.840
Your friends are waiting for you in Łódź.

01:01:01.920 --> 01:01:03.490
Rys, please, bring her upstairs.

01:01:20.920 --> 01:01:24.322
Goodbye, cousin! Visit us again soon!

01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.769
I always wanted to draw...

01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.689
...but I was never good at it.

01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:16.569
I hope someday, you'll teach me?

01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:25.324
Can we see your rabbit?

01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:45.846
What is his name?

01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:55.091
I call him Piotr.

01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:00.769
It was my brother's name.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.443
And what's your name?

01:03:11.080 --> 01:03:15.165
They called me Urszula.

01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.570
Urszula means "she-bear."

01:03:23.200 --> 01:03:24.247
Did you know that?

01:03:30.720 --> 01:03:32.051
Yes.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:42.004
My father used to say it.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.209
Good evening. Hello.

01:05:07.280 --> 01:05:08.645
It's almost bearable today.

01:06:01.560 --> 01:06:02.891
Herr Heck, Miss.

01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.361
Oh.

01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:08.680
What a surprise.
I wasn't expecting you today.

01:06:08.760 --> 01:06:10.120
A good surprise, I hope.

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:12.720
Of course. Always a good surprise.

01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:14.440
I have another surprise for you.

01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.887
Our girl is ready. Come.

01:06:29.640 --> 01:06:32.610
Take the rope, keep her calm.

01:06:33.160 --> 01:06:34.161
Steady.

01:06:44.080 --> 01:06:47.084
Now, come on, come on. Come on.

01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:01.840
That's it.

01:07:06.120 --> 01:07:07.121
That's it.

01:07:11.920 --> 01:07:13.570
That's it.

01:07:51.920 --> 01:07:54.480
Where are your shoes?

01:07:54.560 --> 01:07:56.920
I must have left them in the pen.

01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.002
Well, put them on, please.
You're not a child.

01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:11.291
Upstairs!

01:08:14.080 --> 01:08:16.526
Go, go, go!

01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:33.120
Yes?

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:35.680
- Dr. Zabiński?
- Yes.

01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.924
I'm Dr. Ziegler. I'm the director
of the Ghetto Labor Bureau.

01:08:42.359 --> 01:08:44.488
I've come to see the bugs.

01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:49.451
Szymon died, you see.

01:08:49.880 --> 01:08:53.282
Szymon and I went hunting many times.

01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:57.439
I'm a bit of a bug man myself.

01:08:57.520 --> 01:09:00.888
An amateur entomologist, you might say.

01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.725
Wonderful.

01:09:08.399 --> 01:09:10.607
What an extraordinary collection.

01:09:12.560 --> 01:09:14.479
Szymon died of an ulcer.

01:09:14.560 --> 01:09:18.689
It exploded in his stomach.
He couldn't be saved.

01:09:19.399 --> 01:09:21.607
It's such a tragedy for me.

01:09:25.279 --> 01:09:27.600
I respected him very much indeed.

01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.720
Uh...

01:09:34.800 --> 01:09:38.964
Szymon told me about you.

01:09:46.160 --> 01:09:47.366
He...

01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:53.761
...said some, um...

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:57.284
...interesting things.

01:10:13.960 --> 01:10:14.961
Uh...

01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.011
Listen to me.

01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:26.484
The ghetto walls were built against
our Labor Bureau building.

01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:29.920
We have two doors.

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.760
One opens into the free side of the city,

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.320
the other, into the ghetto.

01:10:35.400 --> 01:10:39.371
In one way, out the other, you understand me?

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:41.641
Yes.

01:10:43.880 --> 01:10:48.727
I will give you papers that will
give you access either way.

01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.040
Dr. Zabiński, welcome to the Labor Office.

01:10:52.120 --> 01:10:54.200
You can take the workers out,

01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.647
I will see that they are signed back in.

01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.200
This is Dr. Zabiński. He works for me.

01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:03.965
You will allow him through
whenever he comes or goes.

01:11:06.760 --> 01:11:11.561
Look, this is Dr. Zabiński,
he's allowed to pass through every time.

01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:19.840
Open the gate!

01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:25.124
I look forward to working with you.

01:11:43.520 --> 01:11:47.366
Bring them out. Bring as many as you can.

01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.761
Go.

01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:23.687
Come.

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:44.088
Thank you. Go.

01:12:48.680 --> 01:12:50.967
Right, right, right, right.

01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.323
Watch out. Watch out.

01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.848
Goodbye. See you soon.

01:13:58.480 --> 01:13:59.481
Who is this?

01:14:00.240 --> 01:14:03.050
What do you mean? He works for me.
I'm Dr. Jan Zabiński.

01:14:03.320 --> 01:14:06.847
Yes, but who is he?
I've never seen him before.

01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:13.600
He is Dr. Kleinhauser.

01:14:13.680 --> 01:14:15.200
He is with me.

01:14:15.280 --> 01:14:17.680
Do you want me to go to the Labor Bureau?

01:14:17.760 --> 01:14:21.287
Do you want me to waste
Dr. Ziegler's time, his valuable time,

01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:24.280
to have him come all the way here,
to talk to you,

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.567
to tell you that he is with me?

01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.761
What do you want?

01:14:31.520 --> 01:14:32.965
I'm sorry, Dr. Zabiński.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.891
My apologies, Dr. Kleinhauser.

01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:44.449
Just keep walking.

01:14:57.640 --> 01:14:59.449
Magda!

01:15:27.640 --> 01:15:29.483
You agree to have me here?

01:15:31.960 --> 01:15:33.689
You will be in great danger.

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:07.487
Will you come to bed?

01:16:09.480 --> 01:16:10.606
I won't sleep.

01:16:13.200 --> 01:16:15.168
It's all right.

01:16:17.040 --> 01:16:19.168
Let's just lie together

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.001
for a little while.

01:16:27.720 --> 01:16:29.370
Was he here today?

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.561
Yes.

01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:40.090
The female's strong.
She'll give birth in spring.

01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:43.560
Did he...

01:16:43.640 --> 01:16:47.725
Did he bathe you, Punia?
Did he wash your hands?

01:16:50.840 --> 01:16:52.600
No.

01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:54.523
Jan.

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.161
Jan.

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.884
We were nearly caught today.

01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:32.080
Antonina? What is it?

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:34.409
I'm sorry.

01:17:35.760 --> 01:17:39.924
Don't be silly. What should you be sorry for?

01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:45.247
I want to do what's right.

01:17:47.480 --> 01:17:52.247
My heart is filled with it,
my stomach with such loathing.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:58.680
And I don't know what to do.

01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:02.360
It's a new world, Antonina.

01:18:02.440 --> 01:18:05.360
Our lives are turned upside down.

01:18:05.440 --> 01:18:07.568
How can any of us know anything now?

01:18:10.640 --> 01:18:13.530
Miss, I can't find any jars of beans, or...

01:18:17.200 --> 01:18:21.600
You must continue to use your ointment,
Mrs. Zabińska, for your hands.

01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:25.287
Just as I instructed.
Now, I will check your pulse.

01:18:26.080 --> 01:18:27.161
Thank you, Doctor.

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:31.120
- Pietrasia, do you mind?
- No, no, no.

01:18:31.200 --> 01:18:34.283
I'm sorry, Doctor. I didn't see you come in.

01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:45.689
You know, we've had to let most
of the zookeepers go.

01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:49.446
Times are very hard.

01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:53.083
It's not your fault.

01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:58.524
You have always been so good to me,
Miss. You and your husband.

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:04.010
Now, I'll be good to you.

01:19:07.800 --> 01:19:09.450
Be careful.

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:26.440
Attention. Attention.

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:29.842
Tomorrow the evacuation
of the ghetto will begin.

01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.880
Pack your belongings,
and prepare for resettlement.

01:20:16.880 --> 01:20:21.080
And now, listen to an old story.

01:20:21.160 --> 01:20:26.160
I wrote it for you. It's a children's tale.

01:20:26.240 --> 01:20:27.924
- So...
- Dr. Korczak...

01:20:29.200 --> 01:20:30.200
Where are they taking you?

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:34.400
We are going to a land called Ro,

01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:36.760
to visit a great magician there.

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:41.640
His name is Zi.
He's a very good friend of mine.

01:20:41.720 --> 01:20:43.920
Yes.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:46.720
Dr. Korczak, my car is outside the gate.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.640
It's just outside, just there.

01:20:50.720 --> 01:20:53.480
It's impossible.

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:58.566
I need your help now,
or the fear will be unmanageable.

01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.280
God bless you, Dr. Zabiński.

01:21:43.360 --> 01:21:45.283
Goodbye for now.

01:21:51.880 --> 01:21:53.769
Pray for us.

01:22:38.360 --> 01:22:39.361
What's this?

01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:46.162
Look who's joined the party.

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:48.051
The pig farmer of Warsaw.

01:22:50.240 --> 01:22:53.560
What will the pig farmer do now, I wonder.

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:56.166
Who knows, Herr Heck?

01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:00.410
A man might be surprised.

01:23:00.600 --> 01:23:04.040
He comes here whenever he likes.

01:23:04.120 --> 01:23:07.124
He touches you however he likes.

01:23:09.080 --> 01:23:14.000
What would you have me do?
I can't send him away.

01:23:14.080 --> 01:23:15.840
We have to work with him, we agreed.

01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:17.760
It was the only way to do this.

01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:21.083
I never agreed to this. Never.

01:23:21.920 --> 01:23:23.000
- To what?
- This...

01:23:23.080 --> 01:23:25.560
This dance you do with him.

01:23:25.640 --> 01:23:28.960
This fun little game you play.

01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:33.125
You don't even see it. He frightens me.

01:23:34.440 --> 01:23:38.520
I am here with a house
full of desperate people,

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:42.360
and he comes here and he frightens me,

01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:44.720
and you're not here.

01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.240
And there's nothing
I can do. You're not here.

01:23:47.320 --> 01:23:50.802
People are dying, Antonina.

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:55.120
Thousands of people are dying.

01:23:55.200 --> 01:23:59.440
And you are here.
You stay hidden here, safe and sound.

01:23:59.520 --> 01:24:02.760
You don't know. You don't know.

01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:06.080
Grandparents, women, children.

01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.605
The littlest of children.

01:24:08.040 --> 01:24:11.010
And I'm trying to help them,
but they're dying in my hands.

01:24:11.720 --> 01:24:14.121
And you don't know.

01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:16.405
You don't know what it's like.

01:24:24.960 --> 01:24:28.440
And here you are,

01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:30.090
fooling with that man.

01:24:34.760 --> 01:24:37.001
Jan, don't you see?

01:24:39.320 --> 01:24:40.321
He owns us.

01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:47.290
He owns us now.

01:24:55.520 --> 01:24:58.524
Antonina. Antonina.

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:14.400
- Mrs. Anzelowna?
- Yes?

01:25:14.480 --> 01:25:15.925
And your mother?

01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:20.922
Out. Come out. Out.

01:25:26.720 --> 01:25:31.203
Here, down on your knees. On your knees.

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:33.041
- Down!
- Down!

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:46.882
Was it her hair?

01:25:49.520 --> 01:25:51.727
Was it her hair color?

01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.686
Of course not.

01:25:57.160 --> 01:26:01.245
Someone at the boarding house
must have turned them in.

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:19.680
On this day, the 19th ofApril, 1943,

01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:22.400
on the eve of Adolf Hitler's birthday,

01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:24.680
Reichsführer Heinrich Himmler announced

01:26:24.760 --> 01:26:27.366
the final extermination of the Warsaw Ghetto.

01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:30.640
Rise up, citizens of Warsaw.

01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:33.520
Join our brothers and sisters in the fight.

01:26:33.600 --> 01:26:37.480
For on this day,
our ghetto will be liquidated.

01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:40.245
The Warsaw Ghetto will be no more.

01:26:40.960 --> 01:26:45.602
Today is April the 19th.
Passover begins tonight.

01:26:51.760 --> 01:26:54.640
May we have a Seder?

01:26:54.720 --> 01:26:57.087
Antonina?

01:27:00.200 --> 01:27:01.531
I know it by heart.

01:27:08.040 --> 01:27:10.771
It's snowing.

01:27:14.560 --> 01:27:17.450
What is it?

01:27:59.640 --> 01:28:00.641
Mama?

01:28:04.440 --> 01:28:07.205
They're burning the ghetto.

01:30:25.080 --> 01:30:28.720
Here's cash and papers.
We'll move Mrs. Mayzel to Bramki.

01:30:28.800 --> 01:30:30.800
They're taking Mrs. Poznanska
to Foksal Street.

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:33.406
- Jan...
- Yeah, good.

01:30:42.800 --> 01:30:44.240
How did you get here?

01:30:44.320 --> 01:30:45.685
I followed you.

01:30:46.880 --> 01:30:48.644
You never let me go anywhere.

01:30:49.600 --> 01:30:50.647
Drive on.

01:30:52.600 --> 01:30:54.364
- Let me go!
- Be quiet.

01:31:41.920 --> 01:31:43.524
Burn it down.

01:32:12.920 --> 01:32:15.207
Where's your mother?

01:32:15.800 --> 01:32:18.121
She's at the doctor's.

01:32:18.240 --> 01:32:19.241
Mmm-hmm.

01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:24.284
And your father?

01:32:25.960 --> 01:32:28.327
He's in Zalesie, I think.

01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:31.967
Zalesie?

01:32:35.560 --> 01:32:36.641
I bet it's cold out there.

01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:39.642
How long has he been there?

01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:42.804
A week. I mean, a month.

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:45.168
A month? That's a long time.

01:32:48.160 --> 01:32:50.083
I thought I just saw him the other day.

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:55.927
No, I told you. He's in Zalesie.

01:33:01.600 --> 01:33:03.728
Well, I love Zalesie.

01:33:05.320 --> 01:33:08.130
I like to swim there, in the lake.
It's beautiful.

01:33:09.760 --> 01:33:12.840
I bet you wanted to go swimming, too.

01:33:12.920 --> 01:33:15.800
And that's why you yelled
at your father on Zurawia Street.

01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:17.160
No.

01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.880
Then why did you yell?

01:33:18.960 --> 01:33:20.849
I wasn't supposed to leave the zoo.

01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:33.440
I want to speak to your mother
and your father.

01:33:33.520 --> 01:33:34.806
Tell them I've come by.

01:33:35.120 --> 01:33:36.326
Yes.

01:33:36.640 --> 01:33:38.210
But Papa's in Zalesie.

01:33:42.240 --> 01:33:43.287
I forgot.

01:33:44.760 --> 01:33:46.728
Your papa's in Zalesie.

01:33:58.160 --> 01:34:01.164
Good boy for reminding me.

01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:09.324
Your parents must be proud of you.

01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:12.847
Tell them they should be proud of you.

01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:19.363
- Heil Hitler.
- Heil Hitler.

01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:43.486
Hitler ist kaputt!

01:34:56.120 --> 01:34:57.724
Stand down.

01:36:15.280 --> 01:36:17.280
We had a girl, Papa.

01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:20.011
I've named her Teresa, like the saint.

01:36:22.160 --> 01:36:25.881
Oh, that's a good name.
That's a beautiful name.

01:36:28.320 --> 01:36:30.049
Hello, Teresa.

01:36:34.200 --> 01:36:36.328
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

01:36:39.520 --> 01:36:41.568
I'm wonderful.

01:36:42.840 --> 01:36:45.360
This is Warsaw calling.
This is Warsaw calling.

01:36:46.560 --> 01:36:49.640
August 1st, 1944.

01:36:49.720 --> 01:36:51.688
This is Warsaw calling.

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:56.211
The Polish Home Army
is rising up against the Nazi Reich.

01:36:56.560 --> 01:37:00.120
We call on all great citizens of Warsaw

01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:03.920
to free our city and our nation.

01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.764
The German Army must not stand.

01:37:05.880 --> 01:37:06.960
Follow me.

01:37:07.040 --> 01:37:10.200
This is Warsaw calling.
This is Warsaw calling.

01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:14.090
Go!

01:37:36.240 --> 01:37:38.083
Aim.

01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:40.045
Shoot.

01:37:48.160 --> 01:37:49.207
Go.

01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:52.925
Go, go, go!

01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:13.400
I was told that he was shot in the neck.

01:38:13.480 --> 01:38:16.051
The Germans took him to a prison camp,

01:38:16.160 --> 01:38:17.571
but no one knows where he is.

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:25.446
I'm sorry, Miss.

01:38:31.160 --> 01:38:35.006
This is Warsaw calling.
This is Warsaw calling.

01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:40.488
Citizens of Warsaw,
we urge you to leave at once.

01:38:40.600 --> 01:38:43.280
The city is no longer safe foryou.

01:38:43.360 --> 01:38:46.760
I repeat, you are not safe.

01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:50.080
We urge you to take only what you can carry.

01:38:50.160 --> 01:38:52.080
Leave at once.

01:38:52.160 --> 01:38:54.760
This is Warsaw calling.

01:38:54.840 --> 01:38:57.720
The Home Army is overrun.

01:38:57.800 --> 01:38:59.760
The Russian offensive has begun,

01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:02.571
and the German Army is expected to fall.

01:39:03.520 --> 01:39:07.206
You are not safe. This is Warsaw calling...

01:39:14.360 --> 01:39:16.249
Herr Heck's taking the bison out of Warsaw.

01:39:18.720 --> 01:39:22.000
Miss, you're not leaving the zoo.

01:39:22.080 --> 01:39:24.640
I have to know what happened to Jan.

01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:26.722
- Miss...
- I have to know.

01:40:25.120 --> 01:40:26.326
You've packed your things.

01:40:27.760 --> 01:40:31.401
The war's turning.
I've been ordered back to Berlin.

01:40:35.280 --> 01:40:37.282
What bad luck for us.

01:40:39.600 --> 01:40:41.045
We'll be sorry to see you go.

01:40:47.120 --> 01:40:50.880
I'm here to ask you, my friend,

01:40:50.960 --> 01:40:52.610
I'm looking for my husband.

01:40:54.920 --> 01:40:56.809
He was captured by German troops.

01:40:57.360 --> 01:40:58.691
He was taken from the zoo?

01:40:58.960 --> 01:41:00.360
No. From Old Town.

01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:02.400
The underground army's
fighting in the Old Town.

01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:03.880
What was Jan doing there?

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:05.450
Buying grass for the bison.

01:41:08.840 --> 01:41:09.841
What did you say?

01:41:11.160 --> 01:41:13.527
Jan was buying grass and he was captured.

01:41:23.440 --> 01:41:25.044
Why are you really here, Antonina?

01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.446
I hoped you might help me find him.

01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.527
As a gift to our friendship.

01:41:35.720 --> 01:41:37.768
He might be dead.

01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:40.523
He might be.

01:41:42.680 --> 01:41:44.284
I don't know. I don't know anything.

01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:51.763
And what gift would I receive in return?

01:41:52.520 --> 01:41:54.488
I'm curious to know.

01:42:44.080 --> 01:42:46.481
Has Jan been keeping secrets from me?

01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:48.966
No, of course not.

01:42:49.600 --> 01:42:50.931
Are you lying to me, Antonina?

01:42:52.600 --> 01:42:53.647
No.

01:42:55.520 --> 01:42:59.320
I just want to find
what happened to my husband.

01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:01.522
And if he's dead, I want to bury him.

01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:04.769
"Hitler ist kaputt!" I heard your son say it.

01:43:05.080 --> 01:43:08.000
He's a child, Lutz.

01:43:08.080 --> 01:43:10.400
It means nothing to him, it's a game.

01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:12.160
He hears things
and he repeats them, that's all...

01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:13.287
Where does he hear them?

01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:15.881
Um...

01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.649
I don't know.

01:43:18.760 --> 01:43:20.808
- People come and go all the time...
- Who comes and goes?

01:43:22.400 --> 01:43:25.643
Soldiers and guards and...

01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:27.840
Believe me, it means nothing to him.

01:43:27.920 --> 01:43:29.200
Did he hear it from his father? Did he?

01:43:29.280 --> 01:43:30.566
No.

01:43:32.680 --> 01:43:33.681
No.

01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:46.040
You're lying to me, Antonina.

01:43:46.120 --> 01:43:47.560
I can see it in your eyes.

01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:48.880
No.

01:43:56.600 --> 01:43:58.443
No!

01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:02.931
No, Lutz! No!

01:44:15.240 --> 01:44:16.844
Look at me.

01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:20.924
Look at me.

01:44:26.840 --> 01:44:29.127
You disgust me.

01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:52.521
So, that's how it is.

01:44:54.440 --> 01:44:57.205
You hid it well.

01:45:07.640 --> 01:45:09.881
But I wonder

01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:13.603
what else have you been hiding from me?

01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:19.441
What have you been up to,
Frau Zabińska, in your little zoo?

01:45:44.520 --> 01:45:46.602
Excuse me, please!

01:45:49.560 --> 01:45:50.561
Jerzyk!

01:45:54.080 --> 01:45:58.005
We have to get them out. Herr Heck is coming.

01:45:58.800 --> 01:46:00.245
The bombing is coming in.

01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:02.403
Herr Heck wants you out.

01:46:20.840 --> 01:46:21.841
Everyone!

01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:26.962
Pack your things. They're coming!
Hurry, they're coming!

01:46:27.280 --> 01:46:30.648
Go! Go!

01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:52.560
Go to the truck.

01:46:52.640 --> 01:46:54.244
- Yeah, go quickly.
- Go to the truck.

01:46:54.680 --> 01:46:56.489
Quickly, please, go. You must hurry!

01:46:59.080 --> 01:47:00.286
Go. Go.

01:47:08.520 --> 01:47:10.363
Come back when the war's over, promise me.

01:47:11.120 --> 01:47:13.805
She's coming with us! Go quickly, boys!

01:47:13.960 --> 01:47:15.600
- Rys, get in the truck.
- No, I'm not going.

01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:18.206
- Rys!
- No!

01:47:19.320 --> 01:47:21.288
Take Teresa, we'll catch up to you.

01:47:22.680 --> 01:47:23.840
Promise me you'll hurry.

01:47:23.920 --> 01:47:25.684
Yes, please, go! I'll find you, quick!

01:47:43.840 --> 01:47:46.730
Go downstairs, hide. Don't make a sound.

01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:03.480
Search the grounds.

01:50:57.080 --> 01:50:59.240
Hey!

01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:10.121
Stop!

01:51:21.480 --> 01:51:24.370
- Stop!
- Lutz.

01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:26.770
Drop your weapon!

01:51:27.560 --> 01:51:29.164
I said, drop your weapon now.

01:51:29.320 --> 01:51:30.446
Please.

01:51:33.160 --> 01:51:36.040
Don't.

01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:38.566
How many?

01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:41.604
How many did you hide?

01:51:43.200 --> 01:51:44.611
I don't know the number.

01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:52.365
Lock her in. Lock her in!

01:51:55.440 --> 01:51:57.010
Do it, Rys.

01:51:58.720 --> 01:52:02.167
Do what he says. Do exactly what he says.

01:52:04.960 --> 01:52:07.280
Come on!

01:52:07.360 --> 01:52:10.960
What kind of man shoots an innocent child?

01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:12.360
You have no idea what kind of man I am.

01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:13.487
Oh, but I do.

01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:15.611
I do, Lutz.

01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:18.760
You are a serious man.

01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:22.561
You're a man of intelligence and of breeding.

01:52:23.360 --> 01:52:26.600
Not the kind of man that would shoot a child.

01:52:26.680 --> 01:52:28.160
Mama!

01:52:28.240 --> 01:52:31.483
No, Lutz! No!

01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:34.850
Ah! No!

01:52:47.960 --> 01:52:49.689
Rys.

01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:08.841
Mama.

01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:17.000
Mama. Don't cry, Mama.

01:53:18.680 --> 01:53:19.727
Don't cry.

01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:22.561
I'm here.

01:53:24.680 --> 01:53:26.284
I'm here.

01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:32.365
I don't think I can walk.
Can you help me, sweetheart?

01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:36.241
- Hey!
- Jerzyk!

01:56:39.600 --> 01:56:40.840
Hey.

01:56:40.920 --> 01:56:42.081
You're here.

01:56:44.920 --> 01:56:48.083
It's my home, son, hmm?
Where else would I go?

01:56:54.280 --> 01:56:55.770
You're home, hmm?

01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:25.124
Rys, look.

01:58:26.520 --> 01:58:29.763
Look. It's a strawberry.

01:59:24.680 --> 01:59:26.569
Jan!

01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:28.888
Jan!

01:59:29.305 --> 01:59:35.407
