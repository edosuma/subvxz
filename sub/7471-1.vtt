00:00.040 --> 00:03.555
In the meantime,
now you give her a big hug from me.

00:03.680 --> 00:06.319
Nah, I don't care.
You wake her up.

00:06.440 --> 00:08.795
Nah, don't wake her up.
I'm just--

00:08.920 --> 00:12.708
Ah, girI, I am so gIad
we are not rich.

00:12.840 --> 00:17.072
You just gotta thank God
for what you have.

00:17.200 --> 00:19.953
I Iove you too. I gotta go.
I'm gonna caII you back.

00:20.080 --> 00:23.629
Okay. Bye-bye. Hey.

00:28.720 --> 00:30.517
Why--

00:34.920 --> 00:37.309
Why wouId this guy, these peopIe--
Why wouId they--

00:40.720 --> 00:45.589
Why wouId they ever Iet
my son go no matter what I do?

00:45.720 --> 00:50.396
I mean, no matter what I do.
I mean, pay, don't pay, compIy,
teII him to go fuck himseIf.

00:50.520 --> 00:52.397
Why wouId they give him back?

00:52.520 --> 00:54.670
I mean, he's a witness
any way you cut it.

00:54.800 --> 00:59.237
It's aII buIIshit. It's aII just--
just seven out of ten.

00:59.360 --> 01:01.510
What are you saying?

01:05.239 --> 01:07.037
AII right.

01:07.160 --> 01:10.789
MorIock Man gets his money,
I don't think we'II ever see Sean again.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.876
That's if he's stiII aIive
to begin with.

01:13.000 --> 01:14.638
- WeII, now...
- Tom?

01:14.760 --> 01:16.557
are you taIkin' about not paying?

01:16.680 --> 01:19.797
- No. No, we pay him.
- Now, wait a minute. Listen to me.

01:19.920 --> 01:23.435
MorIock Man says the pick-up guy
wiII give me an address for Sean.

01:23.560 --> 01:25.994
I get there, the guy
sticks a gun in my face.

01:26.120 --> 01:27.917
I said, ''You want the money? Now give me
the address. Where's the address?''

01:28.040 --> 01:30.110
You shouId have seen his face.

01:30.240 --> 01:33.835
He had no, absoIuteIy no idea
what I was taIking about. None.

01:33.960 --> 01:37.669
- Okay.
- This is not business to him.
This is very personaI.

01:37.800 --> 01:40.951
I teII you that everybody pays,
and we get back seven out of ten.

01:41.080 --> 01:45.232
- If we give him what he wants,
he wiII kiII Sean.
- Tom, you gotta pIay the odds, man.

01:45.360 --> 01:47.920
I've been doing this
for 18 years.

01:48.040 --> 01:52.113
And if I were a betting man,
I wouId bet on the peopIe who pay
every time out of the gate.

01:54.280 --> 01:56.919
Did you bet on the ones
where you got back a corpse?

02:04.760 --> 02:06.193
Kate.

02:09.039 --> 02:13.113
If you want to see your chiId again...

02:13.240 --> 02:16.596
you gotta heIp me with him.

02:17.640 --> 02:19.198
- Stations!
- Mark it.

02:23.400 --> 02:27.154
-MuIIen.
-You think you can run a game on me
and fuck me out of my money?

02:27.280 --> 02:29.635
No, I--

02:29.760 --> 02:32.991
It was out of my controI.
I did exactIy what you said.

02:33.120 --> 02:35.270
You did?

02:35.400 --> 02:38.517
This is how you want to pIay it, huh?
You're gonna buIIshit me, Tom?

02:38.640 --> 02:40.596
Who do you think
you're deaIin' with?

02:40.720 --> 02:43.553
They toId you they were
just gonna foIIow the cash, right? Huh?

02:43.680 --> 02:45.830
Who's the asshoIe
you're Iistening to over there?

02:45.960 --> 02:49.157
Is he a fed? I said no cops.

02:49.280 --> 02:53.034
No FBI. You pay me.
It shouIdn't be a probIem.
Now we got a fuckin' circus out there.

02:53.160 --> 02:55.355
AII right. Just say
what you want to say.

02:55.480 --> 02:57.835
- The money.
- I want to taIk to my son.

02:57.960 --> 03:00.793
Take the FDR Drive down
to the WiIIiamsburg Bridge exit.

03:02.320 --> 03:04.550
- No. I know he's dead.
- You don't know shit.

03:04.680 --> 03:08.275
- Take FDR Drive down
to the WiIIiamsburg Bridge--
- My son is dead. Go to heII!

03:08.400 --> 03:11.119
What did you do?
Tom, what did you do?

03:11.240 --> 03:15.119
Oh, God. PIease, God. PIease, God.
PIease, God. PIease. PIease, God.

03:26.200 --> 03:28.236
- Dad?
- Sean?

03:29.560 --> 03:31.357
WiIIiamsburg Bridge.

03:31.480 --> 03:34.597
And you asshoIes Iistening in, if
I smeII you cIowns within ten miIes...

03:34.720 --> 03:37.359
of that money,
I'II gut this kid Iike a fish.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.397
Is there anything eIse
we can use?

03:58.440 --> 04:00.032
Uh, give me Mr WaIIace.

04:02.600 --> 04:04.716
I'm going aIone.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.717
Is that understood?

04:06.840 --> 04:10.116
No heIicopters, no wires.
Just me.

04:18.399 --> 04:20.959
- You got the phone?
- Yeah, I got the phone.

04:22.320 --> 04:24.914
You gonna be aII right?

04:25.040 --> 04:27.759
- Yeah, I'm gonna be aII right.
- Okay.

04:42.240 --> 04:45.357
Hey, hey, here he comes.
Come on. Let's go. Let's go, Iet's go.

04:49.160 --> 04:51.594
Mr MuIIen! Mr MuIIen!

04:51.720 --> 04:54.951
- MuIIen!
- Mr MuIIen!
- Mr MuIIen!

04:55.080 --> 04:56.832
Mr MuIIen-- It's not MuIIen.

05:01.200 --> 05:02.997
Let's go. That's him.

05:29.040 --> 05:31.600
- Hey, John, keep shooting.
- Man, this is fucking great.

05:35.560 --> 05:37.357
Hey!

05:38.440 --> 05:40.317
Come on!

06:20.200 --> 06:22.794
Endeavor AirIine CEO
Tom MuIIen and his famiIy...

06:22.920 --> 06:25.514
are no strangers
to the pubIic eye.

06:25.640 --> 06:27.756
As head of the country's
fourth Iargest airIine...

06:27.880 --> 06:31.350
Tom MuIIen, whose personaI stake in the
company was reported earIier this year--

06:35.000 --> 06:37.992
But nothing in his triumphant,
high-profiIe Iife...

06:38.120 --> 06:41.237
couId prepare MuIIen for the drama
presentIy unfoIding around him--

06:41.360 --> 06:45.399
the taking of his nine-year-oId son
by unidentified kidnappers.

06:49.000 --> 06:52.879
- Where are you at now?
- I don't know.

06:54.240 --> 06:56.356
Head up to Houston and Broadway.

06:59.160 --> 07:03.039
- But for now, the city and
the country anxiousIy await word--
- You hear me?

07:05.480 --> 07:07.710
MuIIen?

07:10.040 --> 07:13.635
- Change of pIan.
- What?

07:13.760 --> 07:16.718
Turn on your TV.
ChanneI 5. Keep watching.

07:16.840 --> 07:19.673
It shouIdn't be more
than an hour or two.

07:23.320 --> 07:25.675
You understand
what I'm teIIing you?

07:25.800 --> 07:27.597
MuIIen, what the fuck--

07:45.560 --> 07:47.915
It's mine. HeIIo?

07:48.040 --> 07:52.352
David, I need you
to contact Don CampbeII at WNYW.

07:55.920 --> 07:58.480
- AII right.
- Good.

08:01.000 --> 08:03.275
- Bob, can I taIk to you, pIease?
- Sure.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.430
David.

08:08.720 --> 08:12.076
- AII right, here we go.
- Okay, they're ready.

08:22.280 --> 08:25.431
PuII out of it.
AII right, everyone. Look aIive.

08:27.560 --> 08:32.315
Mr MuIIen, we're gonna
get you set up right over here.
We'II get you wired up with a mike.

08:32.440 --> 08:35.909
I wiII signaI to you
from next to the camera.

08:36.039 --> 08:38.793
Ready to go? On five, four...

08:38.919 --> 08:41.639
three, two--

08:41.760 --> 08:45.833
Good afternoon.
We are interrupting this programme
to bring you an excIusive report.

08:45.960 --> 08:50.078
As you know, we've been
foIIowing the MuIIen kidnapping
for about a day or so.

08:50.200 --> 08:53.192
We wiII get back to
our reguIar programme, but right now
we're going to show you something...

08:53.320 --> 08:55.390
that you wiII onIy see
right here--

08:55.520 --> 08:57.875
Tom MuIIen,
Sean MuIIen's father.

08:58.000 --> 09:00.719
Mr MuIIen?

09:04.840 --> 09:06.637
Tom, you're on.

09:09.120 --> 09:10.872
The whoIe worId now knows...

09:11.000 --> 09:13.309
my son, Sean MuIIen, was kidnapped...

09:13.440 --> 09:15.556
for ransom three days ago.

09:15.680 --> 09:18.240
This is a recent
photograph of him.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.352
Sean, if you're watching,
we Iove you.

09:22.680 --> 09:24.238
And this--

09:24.360 --> 09:27.033
WeII, this is what waits
for the man that took him.

09:27.160 --> 09:28.991
This is your ransom.

09:29.120 --> 09:30.951
Wait. Shh, shh.
I want to see this.

09:31.080 --> 09:33.514
Two miIIion doIIars
in unmarked biIIs, just Iike you wanted.

09:33.640 --> 09:37.758
- Oh-ho!
- But this is as cIose
as you'II ever get to it.

09:37.880 --> 09:40.952
You'II never see one doIIar
of this money...

09:41.080 --> 09:44.709
because no ransom wiII ever
be paid for my son.

09:44.840 --> 09:47.559
Not one dime. Not one penny.

09:47.680 --> 09:51.832
Instead, I'm offering this money
as a reward on your head.

09:53.240 --> 09:56.198
Dead or aIive.
It doesn't matter.

09:56.320 --> 09:59.551
So congratuIations. You've just
become a $2 miIIion Iottery ticket.

09:59.680 --> 10:02.956
Except the odds
are much, much better.

10:03.080 --> 10:06.072
Do you know anyone that wouIdn't
turn you in for $2 miIIion?

10:06.200 --> 10:09.351
I don't think you do.
I doubt it.

10:09.480 --> 10:13.678
So wherever you go and whatever you do,
this money wiII be tracking you
down for aII time.

10:13.800 --> 10:16.951
And to ensure that it does,
to keep interest aIive...

10:17.080 --> 10:21.119
I'm running a fuII-page ad
in every major newspaper every Sunday...

10:21.240 --> 10:23.117
for as Iong as it takes.

10:23.240 --> 10:27.358
But-- and this is
your Iast chance--

10:27.480 --> 10:31.439
if you return my son
aIive, uninjured...

10:31.560 --> 10:33.198
I'II withdraw the bounty.

10:33.320 --> 10:36.756
With any Iuck,
you can simpIy disappear.

10:36.880 --> 10:41.954
Understand-- you wiII never see
this money. Not one doIIar.

10:43.400 --> 10:45.470
So you stiII have a chance
to do the right thing.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.913
If you don't, weII, then God
be with you because nobody eIse
on this Earth wiII be.

10:52.040 --> 10:54.315
WeII, he's got nerve.

10:57.800 --> 11:01.156
That's it.

11:01.280 --> 11:03.555
WeII, there you have it, Rosanna.
A shocking turn of events.

11:03.680 --> 11:06.069
The ransom has turned
into a $2-miIIion bounty.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.555
Tony, it's obviousIy
a very dangerous situation.

11:08.680 --> 11:11.433
Anything couId happen. Of course,
we wish him the best of Iuck.

11:11.560 --> 11:15.951
Did you notice he,
uh, described the kidnapper
as a $2 miIIion Iottery ticket?

11:16.080 --> 11:18.594
- The stakes are high on this one.
- Yeah, as you mentioned aIso--

11:23.240 --> 11:25.913
- CouId you turn it off?
CouId you turn it off?
- Mr MuIIen aIso appeaIed to his son.

11:26.040 --> 11:28.508
He said, ''Sean, if you're
out there Iistening, I Iove you.''

11:28.640 --> 11:31.279
- It was very heartbreaking.
- AIso, our producer is teIIing me, uh--

11:33.240 --> 11:36.391
- Yeah.
- MuIIen, you're a fooI!

11:36.520 --> 11:38.317
Stupid ass!

11:41.160 --> 11:43.151
I'm proud of you!

11:45.040 --> 11:47.838
A pair of armed bandits
heId 'em up Iast night.

11:47.960 --> 11:52.033
PoIice say a pair of gun-toting crooks
went into the Korean church
at Murray Street...

11:52.160 --> 11:54.151
in FIushing Iast night
and announced a robbery.

11:54.280 --> 11:56.919
- They took waIIets, handbags--
- Hey, where'd they take the kid?

11:57.040 --> 11:59.235
You know. The pIace we said.

12:03.760 --> 12:05.432
I had to do this.

12:05.560 --> 12:07.710
You had to do this?

12:10.640 --> 12:13.438
You had to do this?

12:13.560 --> 12:16.438
Kate, pIease.

12:16.560 --> 12:20.269
I'm so scared, but I know if
I give him the money, he'II kiII Sean.

12:20.400 --> 12:22.914
- I wouId if I was him.
- What did you just say?

12:23.040 --> 12:24.996
Just Iook at it
from his point of view.

12:25.120 --> 12:27.759
You think you're smart.
You've got everybody off baIance.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.474
- You think you've
got it aII figured out.
- You tryin' to screw me?

12:30.600 --> 12:33.910
And then suddenIy,
out of Ieft fieId, the one thing
you thought wouId never happen does.

12:34.040 --> 12:35.871
- We gotta end this.
- What are you doin'?

12:36.000 --> 12:38.958
No ransom, no money, no profit.
Nothing. Nothing but downside.

12:39.080 --> 12:43.995
Because you've got this boy's father--
he's coming on Iike a stark,
raving mad Iunatic.

12:44.120 --> 12:47.556
- You turned her around, didn't you?
- I mean, the guy can piss $2 miIIion...

12:47.680 --> 12:49.796
- but he's wiIIing to risk everything
just to fuck you up.
- Don't!

12:49.920 --> 12:52.718
How can you negotiate with
a Iunatic Iike that, huh? You can't.

12:52.840 --> 12:55.752
- Now you're off baIance.
- Get down. Lay down!

12:55.880 --> 12:58.952
You wanna stay down there forever,
maggot? Did I get my money?

12:59.080 --> 13:02.436
Pretty soon you reaIize if you don't
return this kid in mint condition
as soon as possibIe...

13:02.560 --> 13:04.915
you're gonna be the most hunted man
on the face of the Earth.

13:05.040 --> 13:09.192
And this maniac wiII never,
ever quit untiI he's got you.

13:09.320 --> 13:12.357
Nobody puIIs out on me.

13:12.480 --> 13:14.948
You know me.

13:15.080 --> 13:17.992
This is my show.
I say when it's over.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.395
- Take it back.
- No.
- TeII him that you were wrong.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.590
- Kate, no, I can't. No, Kate,
there is no other way. None.
- Take it back.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.837
- He's my son too,
and I want you to pay him.
- Kate. They wiII kiII him.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.076
PIease, aII we have
is each other.

13:28.200 --> 13:32.398
Do you think any of them--
Do you think they give-- It's just us.

13:32.520 --> 13:34.795
Do you think I don't
want him back? Is that it?

13:34.920 --> 13:37.275
You think I wouIdn't do absoIuteIy
everything in my power to get him back?

13:37.400 --> 13:42.155
I'd cut my arm off.
I'd-- I want him back so bad.

13:42.280 --> 13:45.750
Katie, pIease. I don't think
I can take this if you're not with me.

14:00.680 --> 14:02.477
Don't quit on me.

14:13.600 --> 14:16.478
Tom. Now--

14:19.800 --> 14:22.553
I think what you did was wrong.

14:22.680 --> 14:25.353
You put your son at greater risk.

14:25.480 --> 14:28.313
Now, I need you
to withdraw that reward.

14:28.440 --> 14:31.079
Just pay this bastard.

14:31.200 --> 14:34.795
Now, I beIieve that
you wiII get your son back.

14:34.920 --> 14:38.799
And when we do,
we wiII naiI this son of a bitch.

14:40.280 --> 14:43.750
Now, God forbid you don't...

14:43.880 --> 14:45.677
your son--

14:45.800 --> 14:48.712
I swear to you
I wiII work on nothing eIse.

14:48.840 --> 14:51.115
If I have to, I wiII take
a Ieave of absence from the FBI...

14:51.240 --> 14:53.754
and you can hire me as
your personaI security consuItant.

14:53.880 --> 14:56.713
And I wiII work on this
as Iong as I am physicaIIy abIe.

14:56.840 --> 14:58.637
- Lonnie, pIease. I--
- Tom.

14:58.760 --> 15:01.194
I never toId anybody,
any of my peopIe...

15:01.320 --> 15:05.518
about you and Jackie Brown, the reaI
truth of it, and maybe I never wiII.

15:08.080 --> 15:10.640
You think I'm worried
about going to jaiI?

15:15.640 --> 15:18.871
Mayor Barresi today voiced his
disapprovaI of Tom MuIIen's decision.

15:19.000 --> 15:22.037
- Donna Hanover joins us
Iater in the broadcast.
- You, uh, care for an update?

15:22.160 --> 15:24.276
Oh, yeah.

15:24.400 --> 15:28.837
WeII, in the Iast two hours
since your husband's TV thing,
we've had 4,000 caIIs.

15:28.960 --> 15:33.476
- And you know how
many reaI, good, soIid Ieads?
- How many?

15:33.600 --> 15:37.149
Zero. And every time
one of these...

15:37.280 --> 15:40.590
greedy IittIe whack jobs caIIs...

15:40.720 --> 15:43.951
that is one Iess agent
Iooking for your chiId.

15:44.080 --> 15:46.310
Now, I gotta teII you, Kate.

15:46.440 --> 15:51.434
I have never been confronted with such
an unbeIievabIe act of sabotage...

15:51.560 --> 15:53.471
by a parent toward
the recovery of their chiId...

15:53.600 --> 15:55.591
as what your husband
puIIed off here today.

15:55.720 --> 16:00.555
It is aII on you now to taIk to your
husband, get him to withdraw this money.

16:00.680 --> 16:03.274
- Otherwise we are in deep troubIe.
- Withdraw the mo-- What if he's right?

16:03.400 --> 16:07.791
What if they have no intention
of returning Sean at aII?

16:07.920 --> 16:10.639
- I trust him.
- You trust him?

16:10.760 --> 16:13.957
Yeah. I beIieve in him.

16:14.080 --> 16:16.719
I stick with Tom...

16:16.840 --> 16:19.434
and we aIways manage
to Iand on high ground.

16:20.520 --> 16:23.432
High ground? Huh.

16:25.360 --> 16:28.511
Like with the Jackie Brown situation?

16:30.080 --> 16:32.071
Yeah.

16:36.400 --> 16:40.075
What exactIy did
your husband teII you...

16:40.200 --> 16:42.316
about Jackie Brown?

16:50.240 --> 16:51.878
- David?
- Yeah.

16:52.000 --> 16:54.673
- Can I taIk to you for a minute?
- Yeah, sure.

16:54.800 --> 16:58.793
Look, Hawkins said that if I can come up
with the $2 miIIion, that he'd work it
so that I can make the drop.

16:58.920 --> 17:01.354
- Come on, Kate--
- Now, aII I can raise is
about a haIf a miIIion.

17:01.480 --> 17:03.596
I know you have access
to a discretionary fund.

17:03.720 --> 17:05.517
Kate. Jesus, pIease. Listen,
you shouId taIk to Tom about this.

17:05.640 --> 17:08.871
- This isn't about Tom.
- ReaIIy.
- This is Sean.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.752
I'm doin' okay.
I'm hoIdin' up aII right.

17:11.880 --> 17:13.757
Uh, Kate, I-I can't do it.
AII right?

17:13.880 --> 17:15.711
I--

17:17.480 --> 17:20.597
He toId you not to give me
any money, didn't he?

17:20.720 --> 17:23.314
Kate, he's my boss. Okay?

17:40.480 --> 17:42.277
Okay, eat this.

17:44.720 --> 17:46.517
Thank you.

17:55.520 --> 17:58.478
Again, I say if it
were my kid, I wouId pay.

17:58.600 --> 18:00.989
I Iike the idea, ''Yeah, you want
the money, come and get it.''

18:01.120 --> 18:03.759
And when he comes and gets it, I hope
somebody cuts their heads off, you know?

18:03.880 --> 18:08.396
I'd get my boys from the Bronx,
and we'd just totaIIy--

18:08.520 --> 18:10.431
- Take care of him.
- We'd mess him up big time.

18:10.560 --> 18:13.074
I think he's risking
his son's Iife.

18:13.200 --> 18:15.509
I think he's a fooI.
His chiId's Iife is in danger.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.437
Pay the money.
Get on with your Iife.

18:17.560 --> 18:21.348
I'd beg, borrow and steaI,
if I had to. He shouId pay.

18:21.480 --> 18:23.277
What?

18:23.400 --> 18:26.631
- A man caIIs me at my home today.
- Mm-hmm.

18:26.760 --> 18:29.718
He ask me to Iook in my maiIbox.

18:29.840 --> 18:33.196
He toId me to give you this,
and nobody eIse.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.869
He said if the poIice
know anything about this...

18:37.000 --> 18:40.879
if Mr MuIIen knows about this...

18:41.000 --> 18:43.594
they'II kiII Sean.

18:43.720 --> 18:45.517
Okay.

19:00.600 --> 19:01.555
Who is it?

19:43.520 --> 19:45.909
Oh, God!

19:47.240 --> 19:49.390
It's very simpIe.

19:49.520 --> 19:52.876
I'm growing very, very tired
of this buIIshit.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.675
- Then couId you--
- Now it's up to you.

19:56.800 --> 20:00.110
Get him to take back the reward
and pay me my money...

20:00.240 --> 20:04.677
or you're gonna find pieces
of your IittIe boy aII over New York.

20:04.800 --> 20:08.156
I'm not gonna waste a buIIet.

20:08.280 --> 20:11.078
I'm just gonna sharpen my knife.

20:13.480 --> 20:17.075
Oh, God! PIease!

20:29.440 --> 20:32.113
And he never raised
his voice at aII, Kate?

20:32.240 --> 20:34.515
No, he-- No, he was whispering.

20:34.640 --> 20:37.234
I-- He was whispering.

20:38.720 --> 20:41.029
Okay. Come on.
We'II take it to the Iab.

20:44.080 --> 20:48.676
You paid off
to save your airIine.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.439
Why won't you pay off
to save your son?

21:02.640 --> 21:06.599
I'm not a marriage counseIIor.
I'm here to get your boy back.

21:27.840 --> 21:29.512
I'm sorry.

21:31.160 --> 21:33.037
I hope...

21:33.160 --> 21:35.628
that you can
forgive me for that.

21:39.160 --> 21:42.277
And for what I have to do now.

21:44.040 --> 21:46.190
Get the shirt to Forensics.

21:46.320 --> 21:48.880
- Make sure they check for
more than one bIood type.
- Sure, Lonnie.

21:49.000 --> 21:52.879
Where are you goin', Tom?
Where are you goin'? What you--

21:54.440 --> 21:56.237
I'm not-- AII right.

21:56.360 --> 21:59.432
Just think before you act.

22:03.120 --> 22:05.429
- There he is.
- Mr MuIIen!
- Mr MuIIen!

22:18.400 --> 22:20.755
- I'd Iike to make a statement.
- Quiet.

22:20.880 --> 22:25.032
And that is that I'm undeterred
in my course of action.

22:28.600 --> 22:30.511
And I'm raising the reward.

22:30.640 --> 22:35.270
Uh, I'm raising it
by $2 miIIion.

22:35.400 --> 22:38.790
- Mr MuIIen, why are you doing this?
- I want my son back.

22:40.120 --> 22:42.350
Thank you. Thank you.

22:42.480 --> 22:45.517
The FBI's efforts
in this area--

22:51.840 --> 22:56.038
This just in: Tom MuIIen
has reportedIy raised the reward money
for his son's Iife...

22:56.160 --> 22:59.277
by $2 miIIion.

23:15.720 --> 23:18.280
Hey.

23:18.400 --> 23:20.356
Where are you goin'?

23:30.880 --> 23:32.871
You've ruined my Iife.

23:34.480 --> 23:36.152
Who the heII you think
I'm doing this for?

23:36.440 --> 23:40.433
A stunning deveIopment tonight as
Tom MuIIen doubIes the reward money...

23:40.560 --> 23:43.233
to $4 miIIion
for the capture of--

23:46.640 --> 23:48.949
- What?
- Wanna taIk to your son?

23:50.200 --> 23:53.795
- Yes, of course I do.
- Mmm, Daddy? Dad?

23:53.920 --> 23:55.638
Sean.

23:55.760 --> 23:59.469
- Sean. Sean. Son.
- Sean? I wanna Iisten.

23:59.600 --> 24:02.160
- That's enough.
- No, put him back on.
I wanna-- I wanna taIk to him.

24:02.280 --> 24:03.918
You just did.

24:04.040 --> 24:07.271
Now, you Iisten...

24:07.400 --> 24:09.868
reaI, reaI good.

24:10.000 --> 24:13.515
You got one more chance to pay up
or you're never gonna taIk to him again.

24:13.640 --> 24:15.835
No more fuckin' around.

24:15.960 --> 24:18.474
This is it right now.

24:18.600 --> 24:20.591
What's it gonna be?

24:26.360 --> 24:30.035
No. BuIIshit. You're not gonna
touch him. You can't be that stupid.

24:30.160 --> 24:32.276
Do you have any idea
the rain of shit I can put on you?

24:32.400 --> 24:36.916
Look at your wife.
Look at her face, motherfucker.
Do you know what I can do to your boy?

24:37.040 --> 24:39.349
Is it dark where you're caIIing from?
You got the shades drawn?

24:39.480 --> 24:42.916
Kind of Iike a ceIIar, right? Like a
cave? WeII, you better get used to that.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.076
You better get used to crawIing
in the dark for the rest of your days...

24:45.200 --> 24:48.431
because I am going to get the best group
of manhunters in this country...

24:48.560 --> 24:50.676
and I am gonna dedicate my Iife
to tracking you down!

24:50.800 --> 24:52.756
- You understand?
- Hey, hey, get your head
out of your ass!

24:52.880 --> 24:55.952
You think you can threaten me, huh?
Who do you think you're deaIing with?
Give me the money!

24:56.080 --> 25:00.949
Fuck you and your $2 miIIion!
Don't you understand EngIish, you

25:01.080 --> 25:03.674
Let me teII you something. You think
you're suffering right now? Huh?

25:03.800 --> 25:08.078
You got no idea what suffering is.
If I don't get the cash in one hour,

25:08.200 --> 25:11.670
I don't get my son back, and I mean

35:14.840 --> 35:18.833

We'II Ieave 'em on aII the time.

35:18.960 --> 35:20.837
Okay?

35:20.960 --> 35:24.999
Next thing I know,
one guy starts bIastin' away at me.

35:25.120 --> 35:29.796
The-- The other guy,
he goes to run me over.

35:29.920 --> 35:33.310
So, you know,
I just did what I had to do.

35:33.440 --> 35:35.237
What about the woman?

35:38.160 --> 35:39.957
Jimmy?

35:42.240 --> 35:45.596
Uh, you know, I just, uh,
got spun around by the buIIet.

35:45.720 --> 35:48.314
I didn't know
it was a woman 'tiI after.

35:54.720 --> 35:57.029
He's a, an honest cop.
He does a heII of a job.

35:57.160 --> 35:58.912
- He's kind of a to-himseIf
type of a guy.
- No, just one.

35:59.040 --> 36:00.439
- But I teII you what,
when the chips are down...
- CanceI the other one.

36:00.560 --> 36:02.949
this is the one
I'd want with me.

36:03.080 --> 36:05.196
- How do I feeI?
- No.
- I'II teII ya, this is
the second time...

36:05.320 --> 36:07.117
- Jimmy Shaker's been shot.
- Just one-way.

36:07.240 --> 36:09.879
He got cIipped once before in 1992,
and this guy keeps coming back.

36:10.000 --> 36:12.639
Yeah. Uh, Mr Kinney.
Yeah. Thanks.

36:12.760 --> 36:15.194
Continuing our coverage
of the MuIIen kidnapping case...

36:15.320 --> 36:18.312
questions stiII surround
Maris Conner.

36:18.440 --> 36:22.513
With no prior criminaI record,
authorities are interrogating
famiIy and friends...

36:22.640 --> 36:26.792
seeking any associations that wouId
connect her to the other sIain suspects.

36:26.920 --> 36:30.037
Sources reveaI today that
the investigation continues...

36:30.160 --> 36:33.277
and the search for
other suspects is by no means over.

36:33.400 --> 36:36.995
Many investigators beIieve that,
indeed, the mastermind
of the MuIIen kidnapping...

36:37.120 --> 36:38.917
may stiII be at Iarge.

36:39.040 --> 36:42.476
- Whoa!

36:50.040 --> 36:52.395
You sure? Hey, you're squinting a
IittIe. Is the sun stiII bothering you?

36:52.520 --> 36:54.317

36:54.440 --> 36:56.715

37:48.200 --> 37:50.236
How's the, uh, kid doin'?

37:50.360 --> 37:52.828
Oh, he's fine, you know,

37:52.960 --> 37:55.076
- It'II take a whiIe.
- Yeah.

37:56.600 --> 37:58.431
Um, uh, forgive me.

37:58.560 --> 38:01.870
I, uh, I thought
we were gonna meet on Monday.
M-Maybe I screwed up. I don't-- I--

38:02.000 --> 38:06.073
Uh, yeah, uh, you're right.
Monday. We-- That's what we said, uh--

38:06.200 --> 38:08.475
See the speciaI officer
hoIding 4-5-9--

38:11.080 --> 38:14.436
Look, I don't want you to get
the wrong impression of me here...

38:14.560 --> 38:19.111
but I was hopin'
we couId do this today.

38:19.240 --> 38:21.674
- You know, the reward and aII?
- Oh. Of course. Oh, Jesus.
- 'Cause I gotta teII ya...

38:21.800 --> 38:25.349
it's, uh, kinda crazy
around me, you know,
with the, the press and everything.

38:25.480 --> 38:27.516
Oh, I understand. Yeah.
Look, they're maniacs.

38:27.640 --> 38:29.915
- Yeah.
- Nothin' easier. FoIIow me.

38:30.040 --> 38:33.828
I'm not used to this, you know.
I-- I just gotta get outta here.

38:35.360 --> 38:39.672
Kind of a private person,
you know.

38:39.800 --> 38:43.713
To teII you the truth,
I never kiIIed anybody before.

38:43.840 --> 38:46.070
Havin' a hard time with it.

38:47.240 --> 38:49.276
Yeah, weII, I'm sorry.

38:49.400 --> 38:52.392
Uh, I'm gIad you did
what you did.

38:53.880 --> 38:55.677
But I'm sorry.

38:56.920 --> 38:59.195
- Sit down, pIease.
- Thanks.

38:59.320 --> 39:03.199
Uh, so, is it, uh--
is it Jimmy? James?

39:04.720 --> 39:06.517
James.

39:09.720 --> 39:11.199
James'II do.

39:27.200 --> 39:30.397
- Can I ask you a personaI question?
- Sure.

39:32.120 --> 39:34.429
Why didn't you pay the ransom?

39:36.880 --> 39:40.156
WeII, because I was deaIing
with human garbage.

39:40.280 --> 39:43.192
No contract wouId have been honoured,
not by them.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.436
You know, the funny thing is,
I wouId have paid ten times as much...

39:45.560 --> 39:48.597
if I had any sense that
they'd stick to the deaI, but no.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.517
- ReaIIy.
- Oh, yeah. ReaIIy.

39:53.720 --> 39:55.551
The thing that reaIIy kiIIs me
about that is the woman.

39:55.680 --> 39:59.036
She'd been in this house five,
six times over the Iast year.
Nice. PIeasant. You know.

39:59.160 --> 40:01.196
You just can't, uh--

40:01.320 --> 40:03.993
I-I don't know how peopIe
can waIk around with that--

40:04.120 --> 40:06.873
That coId-bIooded, two-faced--

40:07.000 --> 40:09.275
That bitch.

40:09.400 --> 40:12.631
WeII, uh, you know,
in fairness to the dead...

40:12.760 --> 40:15.672
we're aII a IittIe two-faced
in this day and age.

40:19.000 --> 40:21.514
It's a survivaI mechanism. You kn--
You know what I'm saying?

40:27.800 --> 40:30.837
I mean, you know, as a cop...

40:30.960 --> 40:33.952
you shouId hear some of the stuff that's
been thrown my way over the years.

40:34.080 --> 40:37.038
Tom, just forget about the gIoves,
honey. He wanted to come home.

40:37.160 --> 40:40.470
- Kate, uh--
- Hi, Tom.

40:40.600 --> 40:42.750

40:47.360 --> 40:49.476
Ohh, um--

40:54.400 --> 40:56.789

Uh, thank you.

40:58.680 --> 41:00.955

41:01.080 --> 41:02.798
I'II go get him.

41:02.920 --> 41:07.391
No, uh, he's, you know, had enough.
Let's give him a breather. Yeah?

41:11.160 --> 41:13.958
Yeah, yeah.
He's-He's had enough.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.310
Okay. Uh, can I get you anything?

41:16.440 --> 41:18.317
No, I'm fine.

41:18.440 --> 41:20.317
Oh, weII, again, I--
I can't even begin to--

41:20.440 --> 41:22.795
I understand.
Don't mention it.

41:24.600 --> 41:25.919
Okay.

41:28.440 --> 41:31.671
Fatima, wouId you pIease heIp me

WeII, this is, uh,

41:44.480 --> 41:47.119
ShouIdn't be a probIem.

41:56.280 --> 41:58.714
WeII, you'II probabIy
wanna be on your way.

41:58.840 --> 42:01.593
Uh, unIess there's anything eIse
I can do for you.

42:06.080 --> 42:07.832
Good. Right.

42:07.960 --> 42:11.839
WeII, I know how these vuItures
out there can drive ya nuts, so--

42:11.960 --> 42:14.997
You know, there's a back door
out if you, you know,
wanna be a IittIe more s--

42:15.120 --> 42:18.510
This check is buIIshit, Tom.

42:18.640 --> 42:22.952
What'd you think,
I'm just gonna waItz outta here,

42:23.080 --> 42:28.108
Let you make a phone caII,

42:28.240 --> 42:30.037
- You can't Iie to me.

42:30.160 --> 42:32.310
Shut your mouth.

42:34.600 --> 42:36.397
Fuck!

42:46.760 --> 42:50.355
You know who I am.
Now you sit down.

42:52.040 --> 42:55.476
Everybody was gonna make out fine.

42:55.600 --> 42:57.955
But you had to go
and put it together...

42:58.080 --> 43:03.313
and now we got
a IittIe probIem here, don't we?

43:03.440 --> 43:05.795
TeII me that part again about
why you didn't pay the ransom.

43:05.920 --> 43:07.797
- I think we can do something here--
- Say it!

43:07.920 --> 43:10.229
You were deaIing with what?

43:12.320 --> 43:16.632
- You had my son.
- You have no idea what
human garbage is, motherfucker.

43:16.760 --> 43:19.638
Do you know what the fuck you're
taIking about? No, I don't think you do.

43:19.760 --> 43:23.833
'Cause Iook where you fuckin' Iive, man.
Look at the airIine man here.

43:23.960 --> 43:27.669
This fucker won't pay one cent
to save his onIy kid.

43:27.800 --> 43:31.110
- It wasn't gonna get him back, was it?
- Hey, did you read the papers? Huh?

43:31.240 --> 43:33.037
Did you see the TV?

43:33.160 --> 43:36.357
I took a buIIet.
I risked my Iife to save your kid.

43:36.480 --> 43:39.870
I took a buIIet, and now you're gonna
try to fuck me out of my money. Huh?

43:40.000 --> 43:42.753

43:42.880 --> 43:45.792

43:45.920 --> 43:49.230
You're gonna pay, aII right.
Right now.

43:49.360 --> 43:52.511
Do you have an account I can wire
the money to? I mean, you got to have
been aII set up for this, right?

43:52.640 --> 43:56.918
I mean, you're not dumb. You and me,

43:57.040 --> 43:58.917

43:59.040 --> 44:01.156
Just the push of a button.

44:01.280 --> 44:05.796
We'II just go down to the bank

44:05.920 --> 44:08.673
Pick up the phone.

44:11.440 --> 44:14.910
Uh, no, we'II go to the bank

Look, uh, you can kiII me.
Go ahead. KiII me. Just kiII us.

44:40.400 --> 44:42.868
Let us Iive. Doesn't matter.
Any way you cut it, you're on the run.

44:43.000 --> 44:46.072
Now, you can come with me to the bank
and be on the run with $4 miIIion...

44:46.200 --> 44:49.829
or you can just start shootin'
and be on the run with whatever

44:49.960 --> 44:51.757
It's up to you.

44:51.880 --> 44:56.078
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go to the bank.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

44:56.200 --> 45:00.034

Bottom Iine: I got my son back.

45:00.160 --> 45:02.276
And you d-- you deIivered him.

45:28.800 --> 45:30.870
We do what you say.
We go to the bank.

45:31.000 --> 45:36.438
If anything goes wrong, you're gonna
turn around and I'II be gone.

45:36.560 --> 45:38.915
Okay? And if that happens...

45:39.040 --> 45:40.996

45:41.120 --> 45:44.112

And when I do...

46:06.120 --> 46:09.715

Do we understand each other?

46:12.440 --> 46:13.714
