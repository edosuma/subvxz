00:04.671 --> 00:07.774
[Kim] <i>Oh, my god.</i>
<i>Bruce has no sense of reality.</i>

00:07.841 --> 00:11.511
He was wearing jeans
that were to here, like, to here.

00:11.578 --> 00:14.014
So he didn't mean for them
to be cropped and bell bottom.

00:14.080 --> 00:16.583
It's just how geeky
he pulls them up to here.

00:16.649 --> 00:20.086
And I swear to God he had Spanx on, Manx.

00:20.153 --> 00:23.757
Everyone in this family
wears [bleep] Spanx, except for you.

00:23.823 --> 00:25.025
I don't, ever.

00:25.091 --> 00:28.995
But I am saying the key
to no stretch marks and a flat stomach,

00:29.062 --> 00:31.631
after you have a baby, is a waist cincher.

00:31.698 --> 00:35.201
I told it to everyone.
I have people thanking me.

00:35.268 --> 00:38.905
Wait, I swear, I think I saw something
on your stomach. Something red.

00:38.972 --> 00:42.942
-Yeah, I have a red dot, that?
-No. Kourtney, stand up.

00:43.009 --> 00:44.477
-Hmm.
-Stand up.

00:44.544 --> 00:45.678
[Kim] Kourtney.

00:46.813 --> 00:50.016
-[Kourtney] What?
-Kourtney. Kourtney…

00:51.184 --> 00:53.753
Oh, my god, Kourtney,
I'm gonna cry for you.

00:53.820 --> 00:58.725
This is, like, my biggest fear of life.
You have a stretch mark.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.327
-<i>What?! Isn't that a sleeping mark?</i>
-[Kim] <i>No.</i>

01:01.394 --> 01:02.595
[Kourtney] <i>You're such a liar.</i>

01:02.662 --> 01:05.365

-[Khloé] <i>Come here!</i>
-[Princess] <i>Dad…</i>

01:12.672 --> 01:15.742
Oh, shoes on my counter is perfect.

01:15.809 --> 01:18.445
[Khloé humming]

01:18.511 --> 01:20.680
That's some item you got there.

01:20.747 --> 01:21.881
[exhales]

01:21.948 --> 01:24.084
I mean, it's across your face.

01:24.851 --> 01:26.853
Is it religious?

01:26.920 --> 01:29.255
-No, it's not religious.
-Something you found in Bollywood?

01:29.322 --> 01:30.523
Singapore.

01:32.292 --> 01:34.461
[Khloé] Did you see Rob here?
I heard him a second ago.

01:34.527 --> 01:37.330
Is he home? I'm sure P would love
to see him. Want to look around?

01:37.397 --> 01:38.832
[Khloé] We're gonna go to Bob's room.

01:38.898 --> 01:40.834
[grunts]

01:40.900 --> 01:44.404
Where's Bob? Bob! Bob?

01:44.471 --> 01:46.806
-He just leaves his TV on…
-[Scott] What's he chomping on?

01:46.873 --> 01:50.076
[Khloé] A quesadilla. He makes Angela
make him every day.

01:50.143 --> 01:51.411
Look how he just leaves.

01:51.478 --> 01:53.847
I just feel bad, like, at this hour,
he leaves the house,

01:53.913 --> 01:56.850
-but, like, where could he even be going?
-[clanging]

01:56.916 --> 01:59.552
Ooh, he has a whole drawer
of gushers, man.

01:59.619 --> 02:03.289
Rob lives with me, but he'll sleep
all day and he'll kind of sneak out,

02:03.356 --> 02:05.859
at some point, and just leave,
and then I don't see him all night,

02:05.925 --> 02:07.894
<i>'cause I'm asleep, like a normal person.</i>

02:07.961 --> 02:10.230
Like he needs Magnums. Get over yourself.

02:10.296 --> 02:14.801
I do understand where Rob is
with not wanting to be seen.

02:14.868 --> 02:17.537
-[Khloé] We are going to lunch.
-[Malika] Come with us.

02:17.604 --> 02:20.673
-Negative.
-[Khloé] Why not? Why? What are you doing?

02:20.740 --> 02:22.642
-[Khloé] Come to lunch with us!
-No.

02:22.709 --> 02:25.145
If you're out, and photographed
and everybody rags on you,

02:25.211 --> 02:26.713
and talks [bleep] about you,

02:26.779 --> 02:30.183
it only gets you kind of
into this deeper, darker hole,

02:30.250 --> 02:32.619
and you just don't want
to be seen anymore.

02:32.685 --> 02:36.456
-Oh, my god. Look at that. It's like a…
-It's like a bomb shelter! It's crazy!

02:36.523 --> 02:39.459
-[Scott] Let's get out of his room.
-[Khloé] Yeah, what if he comes in…

02:39.526 --> 02:42.662
[upbeat music]

02:44.964 --> 02:46.766
Full stretch. I got it.

02:46.833 --> 02:50.403
-Go! Morning!
-Beast it up. Beast it up.

02:51.204 --> 02:52.305
[Gunnar] Fifteen.

02:53.173 --> 02:55.341
-[Malika] Oh, hi, see-through.
-[Gunnar] Harvest moon.

02:55.408 --> 02:58.111
-That ass is out.
-[Gunnar] Harvest moon.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.046
[Khloé chuckles, squeals]

03:00.113 --> 03:02.215
So, G, how much did you miss me?

03:02.282 --> 03:04.184
I just started to,
but then, you walked in.

03:04.250 --> 03:05.618
[Malika] I thought you
were going to tell me tears.

03:05.685 --> 03:08.087
[Gunnar] There were tears earlier.
All right, you're here.

03:08.154 --> 03:11.758
I know you're kind of out of breath,
but I'm sure you can listen.

03:11.824 --> 03:15.728
You have a little bit of a fiasco
going on with your DASH Dolls.

03:15.795 --> 03:16.829
Broya was telling me.

03:16.896 --> 03:20.466
Malik and Khadijah have been spending
more and more time

03:20.533 --> 03:22.101
<i>at the DASH store on Melrose.</i>

03:22.168 --> 03:24.871
It's become more of, like,
a sorority house than a workplace.

03:24.938 --> 03:28.575
DASH employees,
we call them the DASH Dolls,

03:28.641 --> 03:33.513
are starting to get very high school
to me, very <i>Mean Girls</i>-ish.

03:33.580 --> 03:36.916
It's, like, Durrani
doesn't get along with Jessica.

03:36.983 --> 03:40.119
Why? Everyone's mad at you, Durrani!
Everyone's [bleep] mad at you.

03:40.186 --> 03:43.456
[Durrani] Don't ever [bleep]
talk to me, ever again!

03:43.523 --> 03:44.924
If she gets in a fight with Jessica,

03:44.991 --> 03:46.926
then Durrani doesn't come
to work the next day.

03:46.993 --> 03:50.163
[Khloé] They could all be friends,
but when you get to work, you get to work.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.065
They all have to learn
how to work together.

03:52.131 --> 03:57.670
We're thinking of taking them on a retreat
or like a DASH boot camp or something.

03:57.737 --> 04:01.941
When you're at my store,
you need to act as you're working for us.

04:02.008 --> 04:05.578
And this is our brand and you need
to represent us appropriately.

04:05.645 --> 04:08.314
Drive and hold. Yep, stay on the heels.

04:08.381 --> 04:11.317
This has got to be the most
interesting machine you have here.

04:11.384 --> 04:13.853
-[Gunnar] Boom, hold. Hold.
-[Malika] Amazing.

04:13.920 --> 04:15.788
[Gunnar] Hold. Love it.

04:17.624 --> 04:21.427
[upbeat music]

04:25.431 --> 04:27.066
-[Kendall] <i>Hello.</i>
-[Jonathan] <i>What's up?</i>

04:27.767 --> 04:30.003
-What's up?
-[Jonathan] Super model.

04:30.069 --> 04:31.671
-[Kim] How are you?
-[Kendall] Good.

04:31.738 --> 04:33.673
-How'd your shoot go today?
-Good.

04:34.340 --> 04:37.076
How do you not feel that?
It looks like there's glass in your eye.

04:37.143 --> 04:39.579
-[Jonathan] What?
-There's, like, plastic in your eye.

04:39.646 --> 04:41.648
-There's not plastic in my eye.
-I swear. Look up.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.584
[squeals]
It's an eye booger. I don't like it.

04:44.651 --> 04:47.487
[Kedall] Ew! Why are you sticking
your finger into your eye?

04:47.553 --> 04:50.189
-[Jonathan] Oh, my god.
-Moms can do everything.

04:51.190 --> 04:54.027
[Kim] I complained so much about
how much I hated being pregnant,

04:54.093 --> 04:56.462
and I never thought I
would be begging to be pregnant.

04:56.529 --> 05:01.234
Trying for baby number two is just not,
like, fun, like baby number one.

05:01.301 --> 05:05.471
Like, I'm literally, like,
"I'm ovulating in five minutes!"

05:05.538 --> 05:07.573
-And I'm, like, "Get over here!"
-[Jonathan] Yeah.

05:07.640 --> 05:10.143
It's crazy because I had
such an easy delivery

05:10.209 --> 05:11.744
but right after you deliver,

05:11.811 --> 05:14.580
like, the baby lives in this sac,
the placenta,

05:14.647 --> 05:17.250
then you kind of give birth to that,
and it just kind of comes out.

05:17.317 --> 05:19.519
Mine went right back in me…
[deep inhale]

05:19.585 --> 05:22.655
…'cause it was stuck to a part
of my uterus, that it grew into,

05:22.722 --> 05:24.390
so the doctor was like…
[gasps]

05:24.457 --> 05:26.492
…and, like, put his arm in me, to here,

05:26.559 --> 05:28.528
and he had to scrape it off
with his fingernails,

05:28.594 --> 05:30.997
-to get it off of my inner lining.
-[Jonathan grunts]

05:31.064 --> 05:34.334
We have been trying to have a baby,
now, for almost a year,

05:34.400 --> 05:36.736
<i>and they say if you've been trying</i>

05:36.803 --> 05:38.805
for a certain amount of time
and it hasn't happened,

05:38.871 --> 05:40.306
then there's usually something wrong,

05:40.373 --> 05:43.810
so I'm gonna go back see
my fertility specialist

05:43.876 --> 05:45.878
to figure out what's going on.

05:45.945 --> 05:49.982
What I could do, but I'm so not
this person, is having a surrogate.

05:50.049 --> 05:52.251
Doesn't a surrogate
kind of freak you out, though?

05:52.318 --> 05:54.153
Totally, 'cause what
if they're like a lunatic?

05:54.220 --> 05:56.756
I'm gonna have to have
security around them full-time.

05:56.823 --> 05:58.124
What if they run off with my baby

05:58.191 --> 06:00.226
and go raise my baby
in a different country?

06:00.293 --> 06:02.528
I would only do that
if I couldn't carry another one.

06:02.595 --> 06:05.531
[upbeat music]

06:10.503 --> 06:14.340
[Kris] I just hope I could go out there
and do a good show today.

06:14.407 --> 06:16.075
-Do you know all the hosts?
-[Kris] Yeah.

06:16.142 --> 06:19.679
Did Nicki Minaj really smash
the windows of her boyfriend's car?

06:19.746 --> 06:20.847
Apparently.

06:20.913 --> 06:23.449
-Whoa!
-[phone ringing]

06:23.516 --> 06:24.484
[Kris] Hey, Matt.

06:26.953 --> 06:30.857
Did Rob say what is was for
or he just told you to get him cash?

06:30.923 --> 06:34.794
Have you been going to one place
to deliver this money, or is it?

06:35.595 --> 06:40.400
How can somebody need this much cash
every week that never leaves the house?

06:40.466 --> 06:43.136
I don't even spend
this much cash every week.

06:43.202 --> 06:46.105
Yeah, okay, thanks, Matt. Bye, honey.

06:47.206 --> 06:50.643
Could you see if you could get
Rob's business manager?

06:50.710 --> 06:53.946
Rob hasn't been in the best
head space, lately, for sure.

06:54.747 --> 06:58.151
[Kourtney] Hey, Rob, I try to FaceTime you
all the time because your niece asks…

06:58.217 --> 07:00.086
-[Rob] I don't like to look at my face.
-[Kourtney] I know.

07:00.153 --> 07:02.255
But your niece likes to look at you.

07:02.989 --> 07:04.390
[Bruce] I didn't even know
you were back here.

07:04.457 --> 07:06.159
I was just getting ready to leave,
and I say, "Where's Rob?"

07:06.225 --> 07:08.461
and he says, "I think
he's here, he's in the back."

07:08.528 --> 07:10.763
[Rob] I just want my family happy.

07:10.830 --> 07:15.101
You've been running from yourself
from my point of view, Robert.

07:15.168 --> 07:17.870
You've been running
from all of these feelings.

07:17.937 --> 07:23.109
I've gotten a few reports
that he's been spending a lot of money,

07:23.176 --> 07:27.413
and locking himself up in his room a lot,
and not really coming out,

07:27.480 --> 07:30.016
and I'm just worried
about what's going on.

07:30.082 --> 07:31.451
[Kat] It's Michelle.

07:31.984 --> 07:33.052
Hi.

07:33.853 --> 07:35.021
Good, good, good, good.

07:35.087 --> 07:40.193
So, listen, I'm really struggling with all
this cash that Rob keeps wanting.

07:40.927 --> 07:43.629
Um, and I know he wants some more today.

07:43.696 --> 07:49.202
I think that, you know, give it to him,
in case he really does owe somebody money,

07:49.268 --> 07:52.004
but there's something going on here,
and I'm not stupid.

07:52.071 --> 07:57.076
As a mom, it breaks my heart to see Rob
going through what he's going through.

07:57.143 --> 08:02.415
He's kind of stuck in a really bad place,
and I just want to help him get out of it.

08:02.482 --> 08:06.719
I just want you to know
that, um, something crazy and serious

08:06.786 --> 08:10.756
is gonna go down with your brother
because I just got word,

08:10.823 --> 08:13.526
and I'm just gonna tell you this,
and I don't want you to be impatient,

08:13.593 --> 08:17.864
because you tend,
you tend to be impatient,

08:17.930 --> 08:20.633
so I don't want you to say
he's got a problem.

08:20.700 --> 08:23.169
[Kris] He just asked Matt
to go get him more cash.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.071
You know, but I can't
take it anymore, you know?

08:25.137 --> 08:27.240
And I just kept thinking
it was going to go away,

08:27.306 --> 08:30.009
and he was going to figure it out
on his own, but he's not,

08:30.076 --> 08:36.115
so I just think that, we have to,
as a family, do something immediately.

08:38.084 --> 08:41.687
[vigorous music]

08:48.427 --> 08:50.496
-Hi, guys.
-[Bruno] Good morning.

08:50.563 --> 08:51.664
-Hello.
-[Bruno] How are you?

08:51.731 --> 08:56.035
-I can't even move anymore, or sleep.
-[all chuckling]

08:56.102 --> 08:58.738
Both my kids are, like,
in my bed all night.

08:58.804 --> 09:03.910
Then I go, "Everybody, move to the sides,"
and then they come back.

09:04.744 --> 09:07.580
We're gonna start with kids, and then
we've got the new fall directions.

09:07.647 --> 09:09.448
-Oh, cool.
-[Lisa] This is a big group.

09:09.515 --> 09:11.651
So feel free to edit down.
We did lots of tops.

09:11.717 --> 09:14.620
First one is this top here.

09:14.687 --> 09:18.624
I'm not allowed to really have
an opinion on kids' clothes, but barf.

09:18.691 --> 09:19.725
I think it's cute.

09:19.792 --> 09:24.063
And then, this great little dress
and this fun poncho.

09:24.130 --> 09:25.898
[Kim] Oh, really cute. I really love that.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.133
Hey. Did you just land?

09:27.199 --> 09:29.835
And then, that's pretty much
our only short sleeve in the collection.

09:29.902 --> 09:31.137
[Kim] Sorry, one second.

09:31.203 --> 09:32.972
I'm trying to get ahold of Kanye

09:33.039 --> 09:35.341
<i>'cause I just came</i>
<i>from my fertility doctor,</i>

09:35.408 --> 09:38.844
and they need me to go into surgery

09:38.911 --> 09:42.782
to kind of clear out something
in my uterus.

09:42.848 --> 09:45.918
I feel like this doctor that I saw today

09:45.985 --> 09:50.022
was so… like told me
every worst case scenario.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.657
And I was sitting there, like he's like,

09:51.724 --> 09:54.427
"Okay, and then, when you have your baby,
this will be your last one

09:54.493 --> 09:58.831
because the problem is your placenta
grew onto your uterus,

09:58.898 --> 10:03.836
so when you have another baby,
that placenta will go right to that hole,

10:03.903 --> 10:08.507
and then, we'll have, you know,
a team of doctors waiting…

10:09.575 --> 10:11.444
right there to remove your uterus

10:11.510 --> 10:15.615
and put you into emergency surgery
'cause you can't bleed too much."

10:16.515 --> 10:18.851
And I'm like,
"Okay, this is a little much."

10:18.918 --> 10:21.687
Let's… You know, I was, like,
sitting there, like, just like crying.

10:21.754 --> 10:24.256
Like, wait, you have to remove my uterus?

10:24.323 --> 10:28.461
When I was pregnant with North,
I used to tell everyone,

10:28.527 --> 10:31.230
"There is no amount of money
that anyone could pay me

10:31.297 --> 10:32.865
to go through this experience again."

10:32.932 --> 10:36.736
And now, there is nothing
more on this Earth

10:36.802 --> 10:38.938
than I would want
than to be pregnant again.

10:39.005 --> 10:42.675
So I just was like, "Oh, my god."

10:42.742 --> 10:45.878
[dramatic music]

10:51.717 --> 10:53.185
[insects chirping]

10:53.252 --> 10:54.520
[Kim] <i>Mase?</i>

10:54.587 --> 10:57.123
-Hey!
-[Kris] Hey!

10:57.189 --> 10:58.391
[giggles]

10:58.457 --> 10:59.492
Hi.

10:59.558 --> 11:01.193
The other night, I wrote Rob a letter,

11:01.260 --> 11:03.663
and I put it under his door
at Khloé's house.

11:03.729 --> 11:04.697
Yeah?

11:04.764 --> 11:06.666
And just said, like,
"You're not in this alone.

11:06.732 --> 11:08.734
Like, we want to do
whatever we can to help you."

11:08.801 --> 11:10.770
[Kim] And he never responded to me.

11:10.836 --> 11:14.273
So I wrote him a long email.
He didn't respond to that either.

11:14.340 --> 11:16.275
[Kris] A friend of mine
told me about a guy,

11:16.342 --> 11:19.745
and he has a whole team
that he works with, and I called him.

11:19.812 --> 11:25.918
But I feel like if I don't help him
do something drastic, that he's gonna die.

11:27.553 --> 11:31.557
The most important thing
in my life, to me, is my children.

11:31.624 --> 11:33.693
[Kris] I'm Kris. Come on in.

11:33.759 --> 11:37.663
This is somebody
who can help dissect the situation

11:37.730 --> 11:39.532
and figure out exactly what's going on.

11:39.598 --> 11:41.467
Thanks for coming. I really appreciate it.

11:41.534 --> 11:46.138
<i>I've planned this meeting without Khloé
because Khloé's a little protective of Rob</i>

11:46.205 --> 11:49.208
<i>and I'm not sure if she'll think</i>
<i>this is a good idea.</i>

11:49.275 --> 11:52.645
I have a son. He was the star
of the track team in high school.

11:52.712 --> 11:54.480
[Bruce] All right, Rob!

11:54.547 --> 11:56.382
[Kris] <i>He was the star
of the basketball team.</i>

11:56.449 --> 11:59.952
[announcer] <i>Number 23, Robert!
Robert Kardashian!</i>

12:00.019 --> 12:03.089
He took on <i>Dancing with the Stars,</i>

12:03.155 --> 12:06.125
<i>couldn't put two steps together,</i>
<i>and came in second place.</i>

12:06.192 --> 12:08.761
He was always someone
who was very athletic

12:08.828 --> 12:11.731
and he's gained over 100 pounds
in the last year.

12:11.797 --> 12:14.366
[serious music]

12:16.902 --> 12:18.204
I'm sorry.

12:18.270 --> 12:21.340
I don't… I don't talk about it very much,
so it's very upsetting.

12:21.407 --> 12:25.344
Um, he doesn't wanna participate,
he doesn't go out of the house.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.780
He's missed Christmas.
He missed Kim's wedding.

12:27.847 --> 12:30.916
I mean, he obviously has
some kind of depression and--

12:30.983 --> 12:32.051
[Kris] He's very depressed,

12:32.118 --> 12:34.687
but I think what happens is he knows
what he's supposed to do

12:34.754 --> 12:38.958
and every single day,
he treats the next day like a Monday.

12:39.024 --> 12:40.559
So he's gonna get better tomorrow,

12:40.626 --> 12:42.394
he's gonna start tomorrow,
he's gonna work out tomorrow.

12:42.461 --> 12:43.963
He is the king of excuses.

12:44.029 --> 12:49.869
Everyone's been overcompensating for him
since my dad died 'cause he was 16.

12:49.935 --> 12:53.172
I don't know if because he has it so easy,

12:53.239 --> 12:56.809
but then, also, at the same time,
with what he's going through,

12:56.876 --> 12:59.545
I don't want him to feel even more alone.

12:59.612 --> 13:01.881
I'm the only one that's, like,
really tough with him,

13:01.947 --> 13:04.183
so he probably, like, avoids me the most.

13:04.250 --> 13:06.619
[man] If he has everything handed
to him, why would he change?

13:06.685 --> 13:09.955
Kim, I think what you were saying
about you set limits and are tough on him,

13:10.022 --> 13:11.757
and there might be
other people in the family

13:11.824 --> 13:14.393
where he knows, if he goes to them,
he's gonna get what he wants.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.328
-Mm-hmm.
-He knows what buttons to push for you.

13:16.395 --> 13:17.530
Yeah, he does.

13:17.596 --> 13:21.033
[man] I mean, we could bring someone
to the house to help him get stabilized.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.536
Bring meds in and make sure
he's comfortable.

13:23.602 --> 13:25.304
We can pull some resources
within 24 hours.

13:25.371 --> 13:29.241
Yeah. It's just like you're waiting
for this horrible thing to happen,

13:29.308 --> 13:31.811
and there's nothing you can do about it.

13:32.711 --> 13:36.849
We can't guarantee he'll take the help,
but we can give it our best shot.

13:36.916 --> 13:40.052
[forlorn music]

13:43.756 --> 13:46.892
[upbeat music]

13:48.260 --> 13:50.763
[Kim] This is gonna be
the wheelbarrow competition.

13:50.830 --> 13:54.133
-Ooh, I want a donut!
-We are gonna tie the donut now.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.401
[Khloé] Let's do all chocolate,

13:55.467 --> 13:57.703
-so we can have the glaze.
-I'm too short for this, though.

13:57.770 --> 14:01.807
[Malika] Oh, my god. These were supposed
to be round donuts. Who got these?

14:01.874 --> 14:03.542
-[all laughing]
-Inappropriate.

14:04.109 --> 14:06.745
Today is the DASH Dolls retreat,

14:06.812 --> 14:08.714
and Khloé's doing such a good job
setting up.

14:08.781 --> 14:10.583
I'm so proud of her. It looks amazing.

14:10.649 --> 14:11.884
-Bite.
-I have a photo shoot.

14:11.951 --> 14:13.652
-I have a photo shoot. No.
-Come on.

14:13.719 --> 14:16.622
I don't want to ruin our day
and start bringing up Rob,

14:16.689 --> 14:19.658
and you know how that went.
Now's not the right time to bring it up.

14:19.725 --> 14:22.661
By the way,
this is a really good idea, Khlo.

14:22.728 --> 14:25.164
I think it's cute, and I think
it's gonna help the girls bond.

14:26.065 --> 14:28.734
-No! Get out of my way!
-No!

14:28.801 --> 14:31.403
-No, we already called it!
-No! I'm getting this room.

14:31.470 --> 14:32.805
We already called it!

14:32.872 --> 14:35.341
[overlapping yells]

14:35.407 --> 14:37.509
I got it, Nazy!

14:38.510 --> 14:40.913
-So, Doll.
-Hi.

14:42.648 --> 14:44.783
Who dropped you off?
Wait, did your sister drop you off?

14:44.850 --> 14:46.352
She drives me everywhere.

14:46.418 --> 14:48.087
-It's so embarrassing.
-You don't wanna get your license?

14:48.153 --> 14:50.623
-[Stephanie] I just failed the written--
-Wait, study.

14:50.689 --> 14:52.725
[Stephanie] No, yeah,
I'm studying now, obviously,

14:52.791 --> 14:55.527
but the first three times
that I took it, I just I didn't study.

14:55.594 --> 14:58.931
-[Nazy] You took it three times?
-Yeah. But I'll pass my fourth time.

14:58.998 --> 15:01.934
[both laughing]

15:02.935 --> 15:06.705
Based on the report that I got
from Malika and Khadijah,

15:06.772 --> 15:08.741
[Khloé] <i>Stephanie is kind
of having the hardest time</i>

15:08.807 --> 15:10.576
<i>fitting in with all the DASH Dolls.</i>

15:10.643 --> 15:13.112
<i>All the girls need a lesson</i>
<i>or two on how to behave.</i>

15:13.178 --> 15:16.282
We are gonna get those bitches
into DASH Doll shape.

15:16.882 --> 15:21.654
Welcome to the DASH retreat.
Guys, no talking [bleep].

15:22.221 --> 15:27.459
So, basically, the reason
why we wanted to do this retreat

15:27.526 --> 15:29.862
is because Kourtney,
Kim, and I have been hearing

15:29.929 --> 15:31.630
that there's a lot of issues at the store

15:31.697 --> 15:33.899
with how you guys
are communicating with each other.

15:34.466 --> 15:37.436
If you get into fights or whatever,
or date the same people, who cares?

15:37.503 --> 15:39.939
That's your private life.
At the store, it's still a business.

15:40.005 --> 15:43.242
In the real world, you have
to be able to separate the two.

15:44.209 --> 15:47.446
And it's just time I think
that we get all of our [bleep] together.

15:49.615 --> 15:51.016
Let's start with the first one.

15:52.618 --> 15:54.787
A lot of these obstacle courses

15:54.853 --> 15:57.156
<i>that we're having the DASH Dolls do</i>
<i>on this retreat</i>

15:57.222 --> 16:00.726
is trust building or communication skills.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.828
-Wait, are those helmets?
-[Missy] Helmets?

16:02.895 --> 16:04.296
[Khloé] <i>We basically want the girls</i>

16:04.363 --> 16:06.865
<i>to push one another around
in a wheelbarrow, blindfolded,</i>

16:06.932 --> 16:10.169
and they have
to verbally communicate where to go

16:10.235 --> 16:11.670
and trust their other partner

16:11.737 --> 16:14.273
as to that they're steering them
in the right direction.

16:14.340 --> 16:18.177
Once you get to the end,
as a team, with no hands,

16:18.243 --> 16:21.046
you have to pick up
your team member to eat the donut.

16:21.113 --> 16:22.781
So you have to trust your partner.

16:22.848 --> 16:25.517
Whoever eats the donut first,
you get the money.

16:25.584 --> 16:29.254
Remember, a lack
of communication costs money.

16:29.321 --> 16:32.691
And if you guys don't communicate,
you guys cost the store money.

16:32.758 --> 16:33.959
Come on.

16:34.026 --> 16:35.627
[giggling]
Oh, my god!

16:35.694 --> 16:38.063
On your mark, get set…

16:38.130 --> 16:39.832
[blows whistle]

16:39.898 --> 16:43.068
-Go to the right, right, right, right.
-Left, left. A little bit left.

16:43.135 --> 16:45.037
[Missy] Yeah, you're doing real good.
Okay, now go straight. Go straight.

16:45.104 --> 16:47.072
-Okay, go straight. Now go straight.
-Go straight.

16:47.139 --> 16:48.974
Communicate, guys!

16:49.041 --> 16:52.244
We're losing, we're losing.
Go ahead, just run through, run through.

16:52.311 --> 16:54.880
-[Stephanie] Run, run, run!
-[Durrani] Run, run, run, run!

16:54.947 --> 16:56.548
[Taylor] We're going over!

16:56.615 --> 16:57.883
[screams]

16:57.950 --> 16:59.051
[Durrani] Oh, my god!

16:59.118 --> 17:00.386
Okay, now!

17:00.452 --> 17:02.421
[Khloé] Don't use your hands!
Don't use your hands!

17:02.488 --> 17:05.190
You can't use your hands!
You guys are ejected!

17:05.257 --> 17:07.126
Eat the [bleep] donut!

17:07.192 --> 17:08.994
Don't be cute! [bleep]! Eat the donut!

17:09.061 --> 17:10.929
I'm too short!
Can you finish the donut, please?

17:10.996 --> 17:13.399
-It's gluten, I know. I'm sorry.
-No, I don't wanna eat gluten.

17:13.465 --> 17:17.536
-Well, you got to help her, Jess.
-You stabbed my face.

17:17.603 --> 17:20.606
The DASH Dolls do not know
how to work together at all.

17:20.672 --> 17:23.275
-[whistle blows]
-I have some bad news!

17:23.342 --> 17:26.211
You guys are disqualified,
'cause you guys used your hands.

17:26.278 --> 17:30.015
You guys didn't cross the finish line,
so you guys win anyway.

17:30.082 --> 17:33.352
-[whooping]
-[Kim] You guys look like a hot mess.

17:33.986 --> 17:36.188
[Khloé] You guys don't listen.
That's the part of team building, listen!

17:36.255 --> 17:37.723
[Malika] But didn't they also
knock over the head?

17:37.790 --> 17:40.259
And they also didn't finish
with the wheelbarrows!

17:40.325 --> 17:41.927
[groans]

17:41.994 --> 17:44.263
[Khloé] <i>Oh, my god, these girls</i>
<i>have so much to learn!</i>

17:44.329 --> 17:46.398
I thought today was really fun.
I'm sorry, it's so cold.

17:46.465 --> 17:50.436
My sisters and I are leaving the girls
here at this DASH Dolls retreat.

17:50.502 --> 17:52.104
-I'll see you guys tomorrow.
-Thank you!

17:52.171 --> 17:55.707
I just want everyone to get along
and hopefully really connect on this trip.

17:55.774 --> 17:58.577
[upbeat music]

18:03.082 --> 18:08.520
So there's a lot going on
that I want to catch you up on.

18:08.587 --> 18:09.988
-[Kris] Let me just start.
-You match your blanket.

18:10.055 --> 18:11.156
I know.

18:11.223 --> 18:15.527
Let me just start with the fact
that I'm really, really worried about Rob.

18:15.594 --> 18:16.562
Okay.

18:16.628 --> 18:20.399
I talked to this guy
that came highly recommended.

18:20.466 --> 18:25.137
And he seems to think that everything
I described about Rob was textbook.

18:25.204 --> 18:29.274
And that he could come
with all the proper people and help him,

18:29.341 --> 18:30.809
but do it at home.

18:30.876 --> 18:35.814
But because Rob lives with you,
it would have to be done at your house.

18:36.949 --> 18:41.620
I just feel like you guys always do
this stuff, and, like, never inform me

18:41.687 --> 18:44.223
or really give me an opportunity
to have, like, an opinion.

18:44.289 --> 18:48.727
I just acted as fast as I could
because the opportunity presented itself.

18:48.794 --> 18:51.296
So, now you guys want to now
have an outsider come in

18:51.363 --> 18:54.333
and ambush Rob and basically ambush me.

18:54.399 --> 18:56.969
Neither you, nor Kourtney, nor Kim

18:57.035 --> 19:00.339
have even, like, attempted to see him
for numerous days in a row.

19:00.405 --> 19:02.040
Do you even know his daily routines?

19:02.107 --> 19:04.510
Do you know anything?
No, 'cause you guys aren't there.

19:04.576 --> 19:06.111
I just think my mom and sisters

19:06.178 --> 19:11.049
are missing a major gap
of attempts to help Robert

19:11.116 --> 19:13.652
before this drastic step is taken.

19:13.719 --> 19:16.488
I think you guys are going
from, like, A to Z.

19:16.555 --> 19:19.992
And that's where I feel like
he might get pretty agitated.

19:20.058 --> 19:21.093
Yeah.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.228
Because he's gonna be like,
"Where's this coming from?

19:23.295 --> 19:25.998
You guys haven't even had
a decent conversation with me about this."

19:26.064 --> 19:30.569
I call him on a daily basis.
I get rejection on a daily.

19:31.336 --> 19:33.372
[Kris] We're all trying in our own way.

19:34.072 --> 19:38.310
I actually expect a little pushback
from Khloé because it is her house.

19:38.377 --> 19:41.613
But Rob's been living there
and nothing is really changing.

19:41.680 --> 19:45.884
So, I'm praying that Khloé's on board,
and that she'll help me out here.

19:45.951 --> 19:48.120
If you allow us do this in your house…

19:48.187 --> 19:50.989
You guys love just
to throw this [bleep] on me.

19:51.056 --> 19:52.624
He'll be in his whole side of the house,

19:52.691 --> 19:54.526
and there's somebody
that's just tending to him.

19:54.593 --> 19:56.495
He's not gonna be
running around having a party.

19:56.562 --> 19:57.930
[scoffs]

19:57.996 --> 20:01.900
-You have no idea, do you?
-I actually don't.

20:01.967 --> 20:05.437
And maybe that's why I'm so lost.
It's very frustrating.

20:05.504 --> 20:06.705
[Khloé] Mm-hmm.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.675
Let's try it.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.981
[upbeat music]

20:17.382 --> 20:20.552
-Oh, my god. Oh, my god, I'm freezing!
-[Jessica] Oh, my god, I'm so cold!

20:20.619 --> 20:22.354
-[squeals]
-[shivers]

20:24.223 --> 20:27.426
-[Malika] Pneumonia, bitches!
-[all whooping]

20:27.492 --> 20:30.796
[Khadijah] We're gonna have
celebratory drinks first. Sorry, Steph.

20:30.862 --> 20:34.299
-[cheering]
-I feel really bad for Stephanie at times

20:34.366 --> 20:36.268
because she's so much younger
than the other girls.

20:36.335 --> 20:37.536
She is underage.

20:37.603 --> 20:39.438
-Cheers!
-[all] Cheers!

20:40.906 --> 20:43.508
That's good. That's got potential.
Let's have some fun!

20:43.575 --> 20:48.180
So Never Have I Ever, but if you
have done it, you have to drink.

20:48.247 --> 20:52.150
Okay, never have I ever

20:52.217 --> 20:54.686
hooked up with one of my friend's men.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.855
You never have? Then don't drink.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.157
Never have I ever joined
the Mile High Club.

20:59.224 --> 21:00.792
[giggles]

21:01.627 --> 21:04.162
[woman] Never have I ever had a threesome.

21:04.229 --> 21:05.964
-Drink it.
-Really? I'm the only one?

21:06.031 --> 21:08.367
-[cackles]
-Never have I ever had a one night stand.

21:09.835 --> 21:11.770
I say we drink it!

21:15.240 --> 21:17.809
I knew it! I knew what I was doing!
I knew it!

21:17.876 --> 21:19.678
I was, like… I was, like…

21:23.515 --> 21:24.816
[Malika] You're out, Steph?

21:27.619 --> 21:30.055
When you see someone isolate themselves,

21:30.122 --> 21:33.292
do you ever feel like maybe
I should just go talk to them?

21:33.859 --> 21:37.996
Stephanie, I just feel like
she doesn't, like, she just sits back,

21:38.063 --> 21:40.232
<i>and, like, even if I try to have</i>
<i>a conversation with her,</i>

21:40.299 --> 21:42.234
<i>she's just like I don't know.</i>

21:42.301 --> 21:44.670
To me, like, when I watch her
in the whole circumstance,

21:44.736 --> 21:45.871
like, I watched it tonight,

21:45.937 --> 21:48.907
it was just almost like she was
in a shell, and she just crawled into it.

21:48.974 --> 21:51.977
And she looked around, like, "Oh, my god,
everybody's talking and having fun."

21:52.044 --> 21:56.982
Why we're here is to make sure
that we pay attention to what she can do.

21:57.049 --> 21:59.951
-Mm-hmm.
-So, when we see her go into her cave,

22:00.018 --> 22:03.588
let's try to pull her out,
and find out what her strong suits are.

22:03.655 --> 22:05.357
-[screams]
-[splashes]

22:05.424 --> 22:07.159
[Jessica] Asshole!

22:07.225 --> 22:09.461
[overlapping yells]

22:11.596 --> 22:15.167
Melody, [bleep] you! It's burning my eyes!

22:15.233 --> 22:17.336
-Jiggle your butt for us!
-Jiggle your butt!

22:17.402 --> 22:19.571
-[Melody] Okay.
-[whooping]

22:19.638 --> 22:21.173
[Jessica] Yeah!

22:22.407 --> 22:25.243
[upbeat music]

22:26.812 --> 22:29.114
There's gluten-free pizza right there.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.018
-Will you sit with me?
-Sure.

22:34.453 --> 22:36.755
-Why does your hair look different?
-[Stephanie] It's curly.

22:36.822 --> 22:39.458
[Melody] It looks good.
Why don't you leave it like that?

22:39.524 --> 22:41.426
-[Stephanie] Really?
-Yeah, I really like it.

22:41.493 --> 22:44.529
[light music]

22:44.596 --> 22:48.934
I'm noticing some of the girls, like, pull
Stephanie along and help her out a bit.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.103
Maybe this retreat is gonna really work.

22:51.169 --> 22:52.771
[Malika] Guys!

22:52.838 --> 22:56.675
I hope that you guys have
the most incredible evening.

22:56.742 --> 23:01.146
Bond, talk to someone you normally
wouldn't talk to, make a friend.

23:01.213 --> 23:03.448
-We'll see you guys tomorrow.
-You guys be good.

23:07.753 --> 23:10.789
[bright music]

23:12.057 --> 23:15.060
-[Leigh] So, let's talk about you.
-[Kris] Okay, well…

23:17.963 --> 23:21.533
I'm just, I'm just in a really, like,
emotional place today

23:21.600 --> 23:24.136
because Rob's in such a bad place.

23:24.202 --> 23:28.407
I cry myself to sleep literally
every night, worried about him.

23:28.473 --> 23:29.908
It's breaking my heart.

23:29.975 --> 23:35.447
And I feel almost guilty
because I can't fix that.

23:35.514 --> 23:38.316
[Leigh] Is the idea
that these people in your family

23:38.383 --> 23:41.987
can actually feel hurt, but still be okay?

23:42.053 --> 23:44.423
Is that something you can wrap
your brain around?

23:44.489 --> 23:47.526
It's the running from pain
that causes the bigger…

23:47.592 --> 23:51.229
Yeah. I think I'm very well-equipped

23:51.296 --> 23:55.300
to deal with anything that is thrown
my way in life and business.

23:55.367 --> 23:59.271
But when it comes
to really personal things

23:59.337 --> 24:04.876
that I deal with my heart and my soul,
I have a much harder time.

24:04.943 --> 24:08.046
You're someone who likes control.

24:08.113 --> 24:09.915
And you're good at it in many ways,

24:09.981 --> 24:14.753
but when it comes to deep emotional pain,
it's scary to imagine

24:14.820 --> 24:16.555
-that you cannot control.
-[Kris] It is scary.

24:16.621 --> 24:20.292
But the more you fight that emotion,
the more it's gonna fester and grow.

24:20.892 --> 24:22.928
-It's not easy. It's just…
-No.

24:22.994 --> 24:25.230
It's like… And I just wanna be there
for everybody else,

24:25.297 --> 24:27.466
and I don't want them
to see me get like this.

24:27.532 --> 24:30.435
If you keep running
in the same direction at the same speed…

24:31.736 --> 24:33.438
you will continue to crash.

24:35.440 --> 24:36.708
I need some ice cream.

24:37.342 --> 24:38.610
[both chuckle]

24:38.677 --> 24:41.446
[upbeat music]

24:43.748 --> 24:44.683
[whistle blows]

24:44.749 --> 24:46.051
[Bruce] <i>You're late!</i>

24:46.117 --> 24:48.920
Where have you been? The girls are inside.
They're getting ready to go.

24:48.987 --> 24:51.389
Okay, I can hear you!
I can hear you without that.

24:51.456 --> 24:52.991
-Can you hear me? Are you sure?
-[Khloé] I'm not deaf like you.

24:53.058 --> 24:54.759
-I can hear myself.
-Yeah, exactly.

24:54.826 --> 24:57.996
Let's go get the girls, and we'll explain
what they got to do, and let's get it on.

24:58.063 --> 25:00.265
[Bruce] Kourt, you're fine.
You just sit there.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.633
Let's get it on!

25:01.700 --> 25:05.303
It is day two of our DASH Dolls retreat.

25:05.370 --> 25:08.240
And I call in Bruce to help us,

25:08.306 --> 25:12.177
<i>so that Kim and Khloé</i>
<i>can participate in the activities</i>

25:12.244 --> 25:17.082
because it shows the DASH girls that we're
not afraid to get down and dirty too

25:17.148 --> 25:18.450
when it comes to our business.

25:19.117 --> 25:21.119
-[Kourtney] Mason would love this.
-[Bruce] I know.

25:21.186 --> 25:23.121
All right, girls,
let's get this thing going.

25:23.188 --> 25:24.756
-Kourt?
-Yeah?

25:24.823 --> 25:26.691
So, he's starting his first round
of medication.

25:26.758 --> 25:29.961
Obviously, I want Rob to be better.
I miss my brother.

25:30.028 --> 25:32.430
[Bruce] First of all, we need
the team captains down here.

25:32.497 --> 25:34.266
Even at this DASH Dolls retreat,

25:34.332 --> 25:37.035
Rob typically would be
at this sort of stuff with us.

25:37.102 --> 25:39.571
So this is all really upsetting.

25:39.638 --> 25:42.774
All right, we have an obstacle course
and an endurance run.

25:42.841 --> 25:44.809
[Bruce] Each team is gonna get a lane.

25:44.876 --> 25:46.945
You have to pick up
all the clothes along the way.

25:47.012 --> 25:50.315
Then, you have to hang
everything up on a hanger,

25:50.382 --> 25:53.652
and push that rack all the way
to the top of the hill.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.622
Then that will be the winner
of the final competition.

25:57.689 --> 25:59.558
Are your teams ready?
Khloé, are you ready?

25:59.624 --> 26:02.661
-[Khloé] Yes!
-On Kourtney's whistle, you will go.

26:02.727 --> 26:04.996
[Kourtney] Ready? Set?

26:05.063 --> 26:06.798
[whistle blows]

26:07.432 --> 26:09.301
[Melody] Go, go, go, go.

26:09.367 --> 26:12.737
Grab the T-shirts!
They're here! Grab the T-shirts.

26:12.804 --> 26:14.839
-[yelling]
-[Khloé] Grab all of them!

26:17.609 --> 26:20.845
[Bruce] We have a very,
very tight race going here.

26:21.980 --> 26:23.982
-[Nazy] Where's Durrani?
-[Khloé] You'll be okay.

26:24.049 --> 26:28.320
-Oh, my god.
-[Malika] You guys are so [bleep] slow!

26:28.386 --> 26:31.990
Now, we are gonna count the outfits.
Make sure you got 20.

26:32.057 --> 26:33.858
Khloé's team, they have 20!

26:34.459 --> 26:37.362
Khloé up the hill with an enormous lead.

26:39.197 --> 26:42.767
[active music]

26:43.935 --> 26:45.136
Woo!

26:45.203 --> 26:47.572
[rack rattling]

26:47.639 --> 26:49.808
[Bruce] Yay!

26:49.874 --> 26:53.211
[Kourtney] Khloé!
I underestimated your team.

26:53.278 --> 26:57.749
-[Bruce] …15, 16, 17, 18, 19…
-[Durrani] I don't work out!

26:57.816 --> 26:58.817
[Jessica] Oh, my god.

26:58.883 --> 27:03.855
All 20 did make it to the top!
Khloé's officially the winner!

27:03.922 --> 27:05.290
Yeah, we y'all win!

27:06.257 --> 27:09.127
[Bruce] The winning team gets,
uh, 500 for each member.

27:09.194 --> 27:12.664
I hope you all had a good time,
so we could all work together as a team.

27:12.731 --> 27:15.834
Kourt, your Team DASH is ready.

27:15.900 --> 27:17.268
Yep. Let's hope.

27:18.003 --> 27:20.238
[Kim] <i>All the DASH Dolls seem
to be doing really good.</i>

27:20.305 --> 27:24.142
Everyone really bonded
and enjoyed the time together.

27:24.209 --> 27:25.210
-[phone chimes]
-Kourt.

27:25.276 --> 27:26.811
The hottest mess.

27:29.347 --> 27:30.415
[Khloé] Rob wants to leave.

27:31.416 --> 27:32.817
Okay, girls!

27:33.418 --> 27:35.353
[Bruce] Khloé, you better listen to this.

27:36.655 --> 27:39.491
I'm trying to be
as in the moment as I can,

27:39.557 --> 27:43.795
but, of course I got
some wild text from my brother,

27:43.862 --> 27:47.265
<i>basically complaining</i>
<i>about people being there.</i>

27:47.332 --> 27:48.800
I don't know if Rob's making things up

27:48.867 --> 27:52.237
and is just finding any excuse
to get out of sitting with these guys.

27:52.303 --> 27:54.539
[tense music]

27:54.606 --> 27:56.007
Hey, Rob.

27:57.542 --> 27:59.844
So, I told them to not go in the room,

27:59.911 --> 28:02.447
and I said for Angela
to pick, to wake you up.

28:02.514 --> 28:04.416
[Khloé] They're just trying to help you.

28:04.482 --> 28:06.217
Can you please just take this medicine?

28:06.284 --> 28:09.087
It will make you feel
so much better, I promise you.

28:09.154 --> 28:12.490
Like, do you know what a blessing this is
to have people in your home doing this,

28:12.557 --> 28:14.693
and you're not in, like, a strange place?

28:14.759 --> 28:19.431
But, Rob, it's 21 to 30 days of your life.
You've had 2 years.

28:19.497 --> 28:21.866
[uneasy music]

28:21.933 --> 28:23.935
Well, are you feeling
like [bleep] right now?

28:24.602 --> 28:27.138
Well, it's not normal.
You're right, it's not normal,

28:27.205 --> 28:32.544
but it's not normal that you are refusing,
like, the… It's, like, the most best help.

28:32.610 --> 28:35.346
Like, it's the most top-of-the-line help
you could ever get.

28:36.247 --> 28:39.084
[sighs]
It's not the wrong… So what the right…

28:39.150 --> 28:41.886
So you tell me, what would be
the right way if someone could do it?

28:44.289 --> 28:45.623
Okay, but what's the right way?

28:45.690 --> 28:48.960
'Cause you leave
every facility we take you to.

28:49.027 --> 28:50.829
So what's the right way?

28:51.796 --> 28:54.332
Do you think, like, it's fair
to do this to me, though?

28:55.400 --> 28:59.504
Like, I've been through this
how many times? I am involved.

29:00.505 --> 29:02.373
Do you think it's fair
I did this for years

29:02.440 --> 29:04.542
and now, you're gonna
do this to me too again?

29:04.609 --> 29:06.611
Like, I can't do this anymore to people.

29:07.378 --> 29:10.682
It's not fair that you guys
do this to me all the time.

29:10.749 --> 29:13.017
It's not [bleep] fair.
[sniffles]

29:13.852 --> 29:16.521
Just accept the [bleep] help.

29:20.658 --> 29:23.862
It's not fair that you guys
do this to me all the time.

29:23.928 --> 29:25.964
It's not [bleep] fair.
[sniffles]

29:27.232 --> 29:29.701
Just accept the [bleep] help.

29:33.872 --> 29:37.942
Okay, so if there's no help needed,
then what then what is this for?

29:39.944 --> 29:41.146
[line disconnects]

29:41.212 --> 29:43.848
[troubling music]

29:51.923 --> 29:54.492
-[Kourtney] What happened?
-I just really need to go home.

29:55.093 --> 29:56.394
[Kim] What is going on?

29:56.461 --> 29:59.197
-Are you still on the phone with him?
-[Khloé] No, he hung up on me.

29:59.264 --> 30:00.498
[Kim] Did he wake up?

30:00.565 --> 30:02.667
Yeah, he woke up, obviously.
I was talking to him.

30:02.734 --> 30:04.769
He's saying he wants them
to leave or something?

30:04.836 --> 30:07.705
[Khloé] He said he's locking himself
in his room, he hung up on me,

30:07.772 --> 30:10.375
and he doesn't need this help
and he'll just leave, he was ambushed,

30:10.441 --> 30:11.876
he didn't know what else to say.

30:11.943 --> 30:14.746
I said, "Yeah, but try it." So he said,
"But this isn't the right way."

30:14.813 --> 30:16.748
And I said, "So why don't you tell me
what the right way is."

30:16.815 --> 30:18.416
He said, "Not this."
I just said, "It's not fair."

30:18.483 --> 30:22.687
We just need to say, "You're kicked out
of the house, you're cut off.

30:22.754 --> 30:27.125
Your bank accounts and your credit cards
are closed, you do not have a dime."

30:27.192 --> 30:28.626
Mm-hmm.

30:28.693 --> 30:31.329
-I can't kick him out of my house.
-Yeah, you can.

30:31.396 --> 30:32.931
[Kim] That's what you have to do.

30:32.997 --> 30:35.500
[troubling music]

30:35.567 --> 30:36.634
[Khloé] Well, I don't know.

30:36.701 --> 30:39.871
So, Kim, are you gonna tell Mom to tell
Elizabeth to cut off all of his money?

30:39.938 --> 30:41.039
I think that's probably the smart…

30:41.105 --> 30:43.675
-What does he need to buy anyway?
-Yeah.

30:43.741 --> 30:46.444
I pay for all of his bills,
he lives at my house,

30:46.511 --> 30:48.546
he gets food from me,
and he drives my car.

30:48.613 --> 30:51.449
So either way,
his money should be taken out.

30:53.418 --> 30:56.888
[tense music]

31:00.959 --> 31:04.329
How many selfies do you think
you take a day? Just curious.

31:04.395 --> 31:06.497
I wasn't taking one.
I was using it as a mirror.

31:06.564 --> 31:07.866
[Kris] Oh!

31:07.932 --> 31:11.202
Do you remember the days that I used
to have your picture next to my bed?

31:12.637 --> 31:15.440
No. I never had my picture
next to your bed.

31:15.506 --> 31:16.741
[Kris] Yes, I did.

31:16.808 --> 31:19.344
[Khloé] Do you want an update on your son?

31:20.178 --> 31:21.546
[sighs]

31:21.613 --> 31:24.649
[Kris] Yeah. I mean,
tell me exactly what happened

31:24.716 --> 31:26.417
'cause I still don't understand.

31:26.484 --> 31:30.054
I mean, those guys were at the house.

31:30.121 --> 31:31.990
-[Kris] How many?
-Like, six different people.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.458
[Khloé] He was really overwhelmed.

31:33.524 --> 31:35.793
And so Rob was like,
"I'm gonna go to my room."

31:35.860 --> 31:39.297
And Rob stayed in his room
and never left his room one time.

31:39.364 --> 31:41.833
[tense music]

31:41.900 --> 31:45.036
I mean, I don't know how it works.
I'm not a therapist, I'm not a doctor,

31:45.103 --> 31:49.474
but I do know that we've got
all the resources in the world,

31:49.540 --> 31:51.175
and yet he doesn't access.

31:51.242 --> 31:55.380
So I think that now what we have
to do is everyone back off.

31:56.414 --> 31:59.817
Everyone licks Rob's ass
and does whatever he says,

31:59.884 --> 32:02.754
and it's just, at some point,
you just have to give it up.

32:02.820 --> 32:04.489
[Kim] We all make his life so easy.

32:04.555 --> 32:06.624
"Okay, we'll drive you
round with a chauffeur,

32:06.691 --> 32:08.159
so no one has to look at you."

32:08.226 --> 32:10.528
We had a chef on standby, a trainer.

32:10.595 --> 32:14.432
"We'll send people to run out
and buy you socks and underwear."

32:14.499 --> 32:15.833
Like, this is pathetic.

32:17.769 --> 32:20.338
We're not gonna cater to him anymore,
but it has to be all of us.

32:20.405 --> 32:22.006
[Kris] The other way to look at it is,

32:22.073 --> 32:25.310
he's got something
that maybe he can't help himself.

32:25.376 --> 32:29.547
No, he's still competent to where
he can ask for help when he needs it.

32:29.614 --> 32:33.151
Kim is always the one to take a real
tough-love approach to anything

32:33.217 --> 32:37.755
that's serious going on in our family,
and it's always worked for her.

32:37.822 --> 32:40.291
But, for me, this is my baby boy,

32:40.358 --> 32:44.729
and I wanna do anything I can
to help him bounce back.

32:44.796 --> 32:47.131
<i>So it's hard for me to just let go.</i>

32:47.198 --> 32:50.101
He needs help. He's not gonna come out
of this all by himself.

32:50.168 --> 32:52.370
-He's just not.
-But he's not gonna come out of it with us

32:52.437 --> 32:54.973
handing him everything
with a silver spoon.

32:55.039 --> 32:57.175
-I don't know how to get him help.
-We go in and we say,

32:57.241 --> 33:02.213
"You are cut off financially
not taken care of whatsoever,

33:02.280 --> 33:04.983
so either go now or accept our help."

33:06.484 --> 33:07.819
We've done every other way.

33:09.887 --> 33:11.656
There's no other way to do it.

33:13.324 --> 33:16.227
[vigorous music]

33:19.263 --> 33:21.399
-Do you have full makeup on right now?
-Mm-hmm.

33:21.466 --> 33:24.068
[Khloé] Kim's gonna go
to her <i>Paper</i> magazine appearance.

33:24.635 --> 33:27.238
-Did you have to show your vagina?
-Totally.

33:28.006 --> 33:30.408
[Kim] So exhausting.
I woke up at 4:00 a.m.

33:30.975 --> 33:34.412
-At 4:00 a.m.?
-Mm-hmm. I had to go to the doctor.

33:34.479 --> 33:35.613
[Scott] Are you okay?

33:35.680 --> 33:37.482
-[Kim] Got surgery tomorrow.
-What?

33:38.049 --> 33:42.286
She has to have surgery on her uterus
to get her placenta out of her.

33:42.353 --> 33:48.026
They have to go and cut it off,
so he said I can only have one more baby.

33:48.092 --> 33:50.928
[dramatic music]

33:51.963 --> 33:53.798
They won't know
until they have the surgery

33:53.865 --> 33:56.167
if she could have another baby.

33:57.268 --> 34:00.338
So he's like, "You should look
into a surrogate."

34:00.405 --> 34:02.874
You know, I was like,
"I don't wanna do that."

34:02.940 --> 34:07.912
I spoke to Kanye about, you know,
just what our next plan should be

34:07.979 --> 34:10.381
<i>and there's one more procedure</i>
<i>that I can do,</i>

34:10.448 --> 34:13.951
that would potentially make it easier
for me to get pregnant,

34:14.018 --> 34:15.787
<i>and I'm gonna do it tomorrow.</i>

34:15.853 --> 34:19.157
[Kim] <i>Hopefully, this is something</i>
<i>that the doctor can fix,</i>

34:19.223 --> 34:23.494
and we can just move on
from this kind of complicated chapter.

34:24.462 --> 34:27.498
I'm just so annoyed that my kids
are gonna be so many years apart.

34:27.565 --> 34:30.001
I'm three-and-a-half years
younger than you,

34:30.068 --> 34:31.402
and five years younger than Kourt.

34:31.469 --> 34:34.138
I know, but I didn't even talk to you
until, like, a couple years ago.

34:34.205 --> 34:36.741
-That's true.
-[Scott] Really?

34:36.808 --> 34:39.677
-[Khloé] Never.
-Never. I did not know them. Literally.

34:39.744 --> 34:43.047
I feel like you could have
the one we're having in two weeks.

34:43.114 --> 34:44.649
[chuckles]

34:44.715 --> 34:46.184
I mean, just out of respect.

34:46.250 --> 34:47.985
[laughs]

34:50.321 --> 34:52.957
[upbeat music]

34:53.825 --> 34:55.993
-[Kim] <i>What is it, a splinter?</i>
-[Khloé] <i>No, I don't know.</i>

34:56.928 --> 34:59.130
[Kim] It's been in there,
and I can't, with my nails.

34:59.764 --> 35:01.065
Ow!

35:01.132 --> 35:02.200
[Kim] Got it.

35:03.301 --> 35:05.203
[Khloé] Ayayay!

35:05.269 --> 35:06.804
[phone rings]

35:06.871 --> 35:07.905
[heavy sigh]

35:09.040 --> 35:11.075
Yes, Robert. What do you want now?

35:11.142 --> 35:13.778
More money? A check? A car? My soul?

35:14.612 --> 35:16.848
[Rob] <i>Uh, I really can't use Angela
in the morning?</i>

35:16.914 --> 35:20.384
No, Rob, sorry.
They have, um, a prior commitment.

35:20.451 --> 35:22.053
[Rob] <i>It's a</i> [bleep] <i>half day.</i>

35:23.254 --> 35:26.457
So, if it's just a [bleep] half day,
why don't you figure it out?

35:26.524 --> 35:28.659
[Rob] <i>You're just making it all</i>
<i>difficult for everybody.</i>

35:29.827 --> 35:31.796
I'm making it difficult.

35:32.363 --> 35:34.632
Rob is asking to use my housekeeper.

35:34.699 --> 35:38.102
And, you know what, normally, when he
asks for things, we all make it happen,

35:38.169 --> 35:42.073
but I'm practicing tough love,
and he has to do some things on his own.

35:43.274 --> 35:45.710
[Rob] <i>You don't…</i>
<i>I'm not inconveniencing you.</i>

35:45.776 --> 35:48.212
No, you are because you're
slowing down my daily process.

35:48.279 --> 35:50.114
[Rob] <i>You gotta tell me
if it's a yes or a no.</i>

35:50.181 --> 35:52.750
<i>If it's a no, then I have
to figure something else out.</i>

35:52.817 --> 35:55.586
-[Kris] Stop stressing him out.
-I'm stressing him out?

35:56.721 --> 36:00.124
Why don't you call your mother,
who helps you with everything?

36:00.191 --> 36:01.425
You're frustrating him.

36:02.326 --> 36:06.164
Aww, I'm making something
where he has to plan, Mom?

36:06.230 --> 36:09.667
[Khloé] I'm so sorry I'm frustrating
your 50-year-old son.

36:10.234 --> 36:13.104
Rob? You are… No…
[shushes]

36:14.572 --> 36:16.707
Why do you let someone
stress you like that?

36:16.774 --> 36:19.610
This little one literally flicks
his little [bleep]

36:19.677 --> 36:21.145
and allows him to do whatever.

36:21.212 --> 36:24.048
I think this is just all coming together
so quickly, but I think that he…

36:24.115 --> 36:26.350
-What an enabler!
-You are an enabler.

36:26.417 --> 36:30.488
No! But I'm actually standing my ground,
and she's, like "You're frustrating him."

36:30.555 --> 36:33.291
-I don't know why I'm in this family.
-Seriously.

36:33.357 --> 36:35.193
'Cause I gave birth to you.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.762
That's still to be proven.

36:39.664 --> 36:42.533
[lively music]

36:46.404 --> 36:50.141
I can't believe Kendall, today,
did three fashion shows for Chanel,

36:50.208 --> 36:54.278
for Karl Lagerfeld at the house in Austria

36:54.345 --> 36:55.980
where they shot <i>The Sound of Music.</i>

36:56.047 --> 36:58.416
That's my favorite movie of all time,

36:58.482 --> 37:01.886
and here she is, modeling
in that same very room.

37:01.953 --> 37:03.688
That's where the had the show.

37:03.754 --> 37:07.525
Isn't is crazy, like, Kendall's,
like, such a big model?

37:07.592 --> 37:10.027
[phone ringing]

37:10.094 --> 37:11.028
Hello?

37:12.230 --> 37:13.097
Hey.

37:14.498 --> 37:17.001
Khloé doesn't want you there
anymore, today,

37:17.068 --> 37:21.172
'cause I guess you've been saying
some really disrespectful things to her,

37:21.239 --> 37:23.674
so I don't know what's going on
with the two of you,

37:23.741 --> 37:26.844
but you can't talk to people
in a really bad way, Rob.

37:26.911 --> 37:28.946
She's been through a lot.

37:29.013 --> 37:31.882
[Kris] She hasn't really said much,
except that you guys are feuding.

37:33.084 --> 37:35.987
I didn't say I believed anything.
I was just gonna…

37:37.021 --> 37:40.124
<i>With so many children,</i>
<i>there's always a lot going on,</i>

37:40.191 --> 37:44.729
and I get stuck in the middle,
at one point or another, on a daily basis.

37:44.795 --> 37:48.399
And, you know what?
I'm bound to hit a breaking point.

37:50.001 --> 37:53.504
Okay, I'm gonna give you
some advice. I need you…

37:55.673 --> 37:58.976
Okay, Rob. Rob!
Just listen to me for a second!

37:59.043 --> 38:03.180
Just, just… Okay, but I'm on my way
to the doctor with your sister.

38:03.247 --> 38:06.217
I've got to do this.
It's an urgent matter.

38:06.284 --> 38:09.120
I'm not crazy! I'm chilling! I was fine!

38:09.186 --> 38:11.355
[tense music]

38:14.058 --> 38:16.227
Rob, just listen to me for a second!

38:16.294 --> 38:20.264
Just, just… Okay, but I'm on my way
to the doctor with your sister.

38:20.331 --> 38:23.367
I've got to do this.
It's an urgent matter.

38:23.434 --> 38:26.704
I'm not crazy! I'm chilling! I was fine!

38:26.771 --> 38:31.542
One thing I've always noticed about Kim,
she's always so calm, cool, and collected.

38:31.609 --> 38:35.346
No matter what she's challenged with,
she never asks for help.

38:35.413 --> 38:40.451
Although Rob is my baby, and I will always
be so worried and concerned about him.

38:40.518 --> 38:43.354
Today, I want to stay
really focused on Kim,

38:43.421 --> 38:45.323
so I can be there when she needs me.

38:45.923 --> 38:49.293
Okay, I've gotta go. I'm gonna go, okay.

38:49.360 --> 38:52.763
Why don't you just go over to my house?
Kendall's room is empty.

38:52.830 --> 38:55.333
And there's turkey chili
in the fridge. I just made it.

38:55.399 --> 38:58.803
Okay, I'm fine. I just have to take
your sister to the doctor.

39:02.373 --> 39:05.509
[upbeat music]

39:10.081 --> 39:12.450
-[Huang] How are you? Good to see you.
-Good. How are you?

39:12.516 --> 39:13.751
-Hi.
-And this is Mom. How are you, Mom?

39:13.818 --> 39:15.619
-I'm Kris. How are you?
-Hi. Nice to meet you.

39:15.686 --> 39:17.321
We're basically looking
inside the uterus today,

39:17.388 --> 39:20.391
so if you have retained placenta,
I'm going to take it out, okay?

39:20.458 --> 39:21.659
Because, if you think about it,

39:21.726 --> 39:23.260
anything that's in the uterus
that shouldn't be there

39:23.327 --> 39:24.795
is gonna get in the way
of you getting pregnant.

39:24.862 --> 39:27.965
-Can I still get pregnant?
-Yes, you can still get pregnant.

39:28.032 --> 39:32.236
Um, but it does expose you
to risks, you know, during the pregnancy.

39:34.038 --> 39:35.806
[Huang] If I can't guarantee that,

39:35.873 --> 39:38.576
and surrogacy is the only way
to give you that nice, healthy pregnancy,

39:38.642 --> 39:40.311
and a healthy baby, we'll talk about that.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.113
I'm gonna do everything I can
to clean it out,

39:42.179 --> 39:44.048
and, and keep your uterus
as perfect as possible,

39:44.115 --> 39:46.283
but still do what's safe for you, okay?

39:46.350 --> 39:49.153
There is nothing more on this Earth

39:49.220 --> 39:50.888
than I would want
than to be pregnant again,

39:50.955 --> 39:52.390
and to go through that experience.

39:52.456 --> 39:55.993
I would pay any amount of money
to make, you know, that happen for me.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.396
[Kim] <i>And to have a surrogate,</i>
<i>to me, is really scary.</i>

39:58.462 --> 40:02.700
I don't want one.
I don't want that to be my reality.

40:02.767 --> 40:04.969
I just, obviously, like, my last resort

40:05.035 --> 40:07.638
-would be to have a surrogate.
-[Huang] That's our very last resort.

40:07.705 --> 40:11.409
As much as I hated being pregnant,
and I complained every step of the way,

40:11.475 --> 40:14.345
and joked that I would want one,
I don't really want a surrogate.

40:14.412 --> 40:17.248
The last thing I want to happen
is your mom to be watching

40:17.314 --> 40:19.884
when, uh, you're bleeding
and having that difficult delivery.

40:19.950 --> 40:22.319
Your safety and your health
of the pregnancy is very important.

40:22.386 --> 40:25.055
I know your wishes, but I also want you
to have a healthy pregnancy

40:25.122 --> 40:26.424
and a healthy delivery, okay?

40:26.490 --> 40:28.426
-That's the ultimate goal for me.
-Thank you.

40:28.492 --> 40:30.327
-[Kris] Thank you.
-[Huang] You're welcome.

40:31.629 --> 40:35.733
I wouldn't dare ask anyone
to do that for me.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.169
Kourtney probably would do it.

40:39.136 --> 40:43.073
Yeah, but it would be so annoying
if I couldn't carry my own baby.

40:45.142 --> 40:47.845
Yeah, that would be kind of heartbreaking.

40:48.779 --> 40:51.148
[Kris] <i>Kim's surgery worries me.</i>

40:51.215 --> 40:54.251
I was in the delivery room
when Kim gave birth to North,

40:54.318 --> 40:56.987
and I saw what was going on in there,

40:57.054 --> 41:00.491
and was actually worried
after she gave birth,

41:00.558 --> 41:03.961
and the condition of her, her uterus,

41:04.028 --> 41:07.097
and how that was gonna affect
any future pregnancy.

41:08.132 --> 41:10.468
[nurse] You can never give a baby
too many kisses.

41:15.573 --> 41:17.641
[Kim] <i>On the next</i>
Keeping Up with the Kardashians…

41:17.708 --> 41:19.510
-Is Kylie here yet?
-Kylie isn't coming.

41:19.577 --> 41:21.312
She said she's on strike.

41:21.378 --> 41:24.315
I've been having such
a tough time connecting with Kylie.

41:24.381 --> 41:27.384
-Mom, how's she doing?
-I legit don't care.

41:28.486 --> 41:29.787
[Malika] Road trip!

41:29.854 --> 41:32.623
Malika has been acting distant towards me.

41:32.690 --> 41:35.793
-Malika, look! You're over it?
