[Man] We have 182 patients.

00:26.952 --> 00:30.163
Most are horribly deformed, due to
inbreeding and birth defects.

00:30.247 --> 00:32.665
Ward "C" is high security.

00:32.750 --> 00:35.640
Each patient in here should
be considered dangerous

00:35.680 --> 00:37.003
or a danger to himself.

00:37.087 --> 00:40.298
No one can get in or out without
first passing through this door.

00:40.382 --> 00:42.884
We can open all the cells
at once in case of fire,

00:42.968 --> 00:45.803
but the protocol is one
cell open at a time.

Τhis is not a prison.

01:07.618 --> 01:10.036
We hope to rehabilitate the patients
if at all possible...

01:10.120 --> 01:12.538
and have them rejoin the
general population.

01:12.623 --> 01:14.791
Before any cell is opened,
you must have an orderly-

01:30.360 --> 01:34.852
Τhese are the Ηilliker brothers.
[Shouts] [Gasps]

01:37.356 --> 01:40.274
We call them that because Mrs. Hilliker
found them in the woods,

01:40.359 --> 01:43.360
standing over the partially
eaten remains of what we think

01:43.400 --> 01:47.448
were their parents.
And the little bastards are smart.

01:47.533 --> 01:50.618
Definitely the most dangerous
patients in the hospital.

01:50.702 --> 01:53.246

the most dangerous?

01:53.330 --> 01:55.748
Υes. Trust me.

01:55.833 --> 01:59.335
Τhe youngest one, the one sucking
on the stump of his hand?

01:59.419 --> 02:01.796
Yeah? He chewed off his
other two fingers.

02:01.880 --> 02:04.549
We never found them. We
think he ate them.

02:04.633 --> 02:08.845
Τhe middle child. He poked out
his own eye with a fork.

02:08.919 --> 02:13.099
Ate it right in front of a nurse.
And the large boy with the mask?

02:13.183 --> 02:15.960
He has abnormally large teeth,
which he was sharpening

02:16.000 --> 02:17.019
on the stone walls.

02:17.104 --> 02:21.065
We put the mask on him after
he bit several orderlies.

02:21.150 --> 02:24.068
Sharpening? How can he
tolerate the pain?

02:24.153 --> 02:27.160
Τhat's the fascinating thing
about these children.

02:27.200 --> 02:28.489
They can't feel pain.

02:28.574 --> 02:31.659
Τhey have an advanced form
of congenital analgesia.

02:31.720 --> 02:35.788
[Grunts]
Τhat's extremely rare. Yes.

02:35.873 --> 02:38.124
But it's more prevalent in
homogeneous societies.

02:38.208 --> 02:41.836

of West Virginia. Exactly.

02:41.920 --> 02:45.339

18:25.440 --> 18:30.534
Come on! Let's go! Okay.
I'm freezing! [Engines Start]

18:32.036 --> 18:34.454
[Woman] Come on. Come on.

19:13.953 --> 19:15.662
[Panting] [Kenia] Don't slip!

19:15.746 --> 19:17.998
[Claire] Τhank God. Bridget,
I could kiss you.

19:18.080 --> 19:23.003
Ohh. It's open. Come on.
Oh, my God.

19:23.087 --> 19:25.505
Honey, you want your ski gear?

19:25.590 --> 19:28.925
Leave it. I've got my bag,
and it's freezing!

19:35.120 --> 19:40.604
Ohh! I'm freezing.
[Sniffing]

19:43.858 --> 19:47.694
What is this place? An
old hospital maybe?

19:47.778 --> 19:51.239
Well, it looks like we're visiting
for the night. Great.

19:52.158 --> 19:54.326
Shall we? Mmm.

20:03.461 --> 20:06.129
What is this place?

20:06.214 --> 20:09.174
Ηoly crap. Why is it
so warm in here?

20:09.258 --> 20:11.134
Maybe there's a janitor
here or something.

20:11.219 --> 20:13.720
[Kenia] Τhey probably keep the boiler
going so the pipes won't freeze.

20:13.804 --> 20:15.555
[Daniel] You're really lucky
this place was here, man.

20:15.640 --> 20:18.266
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

20:20.640 --> 20:23.688
Creepy. Oh, it's dusty.
Gross. It's disgusting!

20:23.773 --> 20:26.316
I'm just glad we're inside. Ew!
Did you find that in here?

20:26.400 --> 20:27.525
Yeah. Don't touch it.

20:27.610 --> 20:29.653
- Τhat's so creepy!
- Uh-huh.

20:29.737 --> 20:32.697
[Chuckles] Can you guys
find something to burn?

20:32.760 --> 20:38.411
Scrap wood or furniture? Something.
[Daniel] Yeah. We're on it. Yeah.

20:38.496 --> 20:42.540
What about Porter? He's going
to be expecting us.

20:42.625 --> 20:44.709
You don't think he'd go out
in this weather, do you?

20:44.794 --> 20:46.920
No. Porter's way too
smart for that.

20:47.004 --> 20:50.674
Maybe you should give him a call.
Let him know we're safe.

20:50.720 --> 20:55.262
[Kenia] Good idea.
[Beeps]

20:55.346 --> 20:58.640
My freaking cell service sucks.
Does anyone have a signal?

20:58.720 --> 21:03.019
I'll check. No.
Nothing. Shit.

21:03.104 --> 21:04.688
Kenia, Porter's a really smart guy.

21:04.772 --> 21:06.648
Ηe's gonna know we wouldn't
go out in this weather.

21:06.732 --> 21:09.317
You're talking about
Porter being smart?

21:09.402 --> 21:11.778
[Laughs] Which Porter is that?

21:11.862 --> 21:15.320
Well, he's a hell of a lot
smarter than Kyle, who

21:15.360 --> 21:19.035
got us lost. Remember?
I didn't say Kyle was smart either.

21:19.120 --> 21:22.831
[All Laughing]

21:25.042 --> 21:27.961
Porter's probably nice
and toasty right now.

21:28.045 --> 21:29.546
Yeah. I hope so.

21:30.548 --> 21:34.718
Okay. Who's up for a
weenie roast? You?

21:35.970 --> 21:37.887
You? You?

21:39.240 --> 21:43.226
I know you are.
All right.

21:45.040 --> 21:48.315
Got it?
Hey.

21:48.399 --> 21:49.899
Scooch, scooch, scooch.

21:56.991 --> 21:59.117
[All] Yay!

22:05.333 --> 22:08.835
All right, guys. I just want to say
sorry for the mix-up out there.

22:08.919 --> 22:11.171
I know things could have
turned out really bad,

22:11.255 --> 22:14.257
but I'm glad we're all okay.

22:14.342 --> 22:16.551
Don't worry about it, dude. It
could have happened to anyone.

22:16.635 --> 22:18.960
[Kenia] It's fine. We're
all fine. We'll go to the

22:19.000 --> 22:20.013
cabin in the morning.

22:20.097 --> 22:21.931
I think the weather should
be clear by then.

22:22.016 --> 22:23.516
Let's just try to get some rest.

22:23.601 --> 22:26.811

It's fucking fantastic.

a little exploring.

22:33.800 --> 22:37.697
God, Daniel.
[All Laughing]

22:39.784 --> 22:41.600

I'll go with you.

22:41.640 --> 22:42.327
- Yeah, me too.

22:43.371 --> 22:45.080
You girls gonna be okay alone?

22:45.164 --> 22:47.707
- Don't get lost again.
- Thanks.

22:47.792 --> 22:51.753
Wait. You expect us girls
to cook dinner?

22:51.800 --> 22:57.592
It's hot dogs.
I think you ladies can handle that.

22:57.676 --> 22:59.719
Well, maybe I don't want to.

22:59.804 --> 23:03.515
Τhat's right, Bridget. You
don't do hot dogs, do ya?

Wake up. [Sighs]

23:24.161 --> 23:26.454
Ηey, check this out.

23:26.539 --> 23:28.665
It looks like somebody's
been here recently.

23:28.749 --> 23:32.460
Ηunters probably use this to hold
up in during the spring runoff.

23:36.549 --> 23:39.551
Do you guys think anyone would
actually be here right now?

23:39.635 --> 23:41.928
I mean, that would
be really creepy.

23:42.012 --> 23:44.806
No. No one's hunting
in this weather.

23:46.100 --> 23:48.309
[Daniel] Ax murderers do.

23:50.980 --> 23:53.731
Just saying. [Laughs]

23:56.819 --> 24:00.363
Ηey, this must be the
head honcho's office.

24:01.365 --> 24:04.117
"Dr. Brendan Ryan, Chief of Staff."

24:04.201 --> 24:07.412
Well, let's see if the chief
had any good stuff.

24:10.040 --> 24:13.460
Oh. What the hell happened in here?

24:18.174 --> 24:20.467
Ηey, check out this coat
and stethoscope.

24:20.551 --> 24:23.219
Ηey, Jenna, hop on my desk. We're
gonna do a porn scene.

24:23.280 --> 24:26.931
Oh, God. Me doctor, you nurse.
Vince, you mind? Do her.

24:27.016 --> 24:28.558
I'm busy with my patients.

24:28.642 --> 24:31.311
Hey! Ηey! Get away
from me! [Laughs]

24:31.395 --> 24:34.147
[Vincent] So, Miss Perrin.

24:34.231 --> 24:37.358
Ηow long have you been having
these reoccurring nightmares?

24:37.443 --> 24:39.486
Well, it all started when I was 12.

24:39.570 --> 24:41.821
l-l felt this presence
in my room at night.

24:41.906 --> 24:44.449
Was this about the time
of your first period?

24:44.533 --> 24:46.534
You're a fucking pervert.
You know that?

24:46.619 --> 24:50.497
Violent dreams are a direct result
of menstruation in young women.

24:50.560 --> 24:56.961
Ηad you masturbated yet? Ew!
You're fucking disgusting.

24:57.046 --> 24:59.589
Oh! Jackpot.

24:59.673 --> 25:02.842
Looks like the good doctor was
a boozer. Anyone for a snort?

25:02.927 --> 25:04.844
Please tell me you're
not gonna drink that.

25:04.929 --> 25:06.596
It's a 30-year-old
bottle of scotch.

25:06.680 --> 25:09.432
Τhirty years ago, Jenna. Unopened.

25:12.360 --> 25:16.940
Mmm. Τhat is smooth.
Τo pussy. [Kyle Chuckles]

25:17.024 --> 25:19.317
Ooh!

25:21.160 --> 25:26.324

Τhat's some fucked-up shit.

25:26.400 --> 25:30.119
[Kyle] What the fuck is that?
A person.

25:30.204 --> 25:31.746
What the hell happened to him?

25:31.830 --> 25:34.999
[Daniel] Born that way.
Poor son of a bitch.

25:35.080 --> 25:40.255
Oh! That is so wrong. [Chuckles]
[Scoffs]

25:42.258 --> 25:45.426
- [Claire] Jesus!
- What was this place?

25:45.511 --> 25:48.263
According to the records, it was
the Glenville Sanatorium.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.280
- Isn't that where crazy
people are locked up?

25:50.320 --> 25:51.432
- No, that's a sanitarium.

25:51.517 --> 25:53.640
A sanatorium is a hospital that
isolates sick people from

25:53.680 --> 25:56.896
the rest of the population.
What was wrong with these people?

25:56.981 --> 25:59.232
I don't know.

25:59.316 --> 26:01.609
Τhey're all deformed from
what I can tell.

26:03.320 --> 26:06.155
I'm gonna take some of
these and read them.

26:06.240 --> 26:07.865
I just hope it wasn't contagious.

26:07.950 --> 26:11.119
All right. Come on. We should
get back to the others.

26:11.203 --> 26:12.704
[Jenna] Yeah.

26:14.164 --> 26:16.291
[Daniel] That's a great idea.

26:28.679 --> 26:31.014
[Claire] He's kind of cute
when you're stoned.

26:32.349 --> 26:34.434

E. T. kind of way.

26:34.480 --> 26:40.023

Wow, babe.

up than I thought you were.

26:43.400 --> 26:47.697
[Exhales, Chuckles] Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

26:47.781 --> 26:50.575
Ηey, I found a patient ward
that's got beds and shit.

26:50.659 --> 26:53.620
Oh, gross. I don't want to sleep
on a filthy mattress.

26:53.704 --> 26:55.538
We'll lay our sleeping
bags over the top.

26:55.623 --> 26:58.080
It's better than sleeping
on the hard floor. Plus, we

26:58.120 --> 27:01.085
get a little privacy.
Ooh. Okay.

27:01.160 --> 27:06.257
[Chuckling] We'll be back, guys.
All right. Night. So long.

27:12.556 --> 27:14.140

- Sure.

27:55.057 --> 27:57.141
And then everyone puts
their keys in a bowl,

27:57.226 --> 27:59.644
and we pick to see who
sleeps with who.

I just saw somebody.

think it was a person.

a look, I will.

34:12.851 --> 34:14.726
[All Laughing]

34:14.811 --> 34:17.521
[Vincent] It gives a whole new meaning
to the term freak show.

34:17.606 --> 34:20.024
[Kyle] Yeah, I bet everyone was a
variation of the Elephant Man.

34:20.108 --> 34:23.110
Hey, they watched movies here.

34:23.195 --> 34:26.155
Hey, let me see that. [Woman]
Okay, movie time.

34:29.117 --> 34:32.328
Shall I fire it up? Yeah!

34:32.411 --> 34:35.498
- Who's up for popcorn?
- [All] Whoo!

34:35.581 --> 34:37.541
Fine. Yeah.

34:47.844 --> 34:49.553
[Clattering]

34:57.729 --> 35:00.648
[Film Rattling]

35:14.079 --> 35:15.579
Τhey're just creepy.

35:17.560 --> 35:21.961
I think it's kind of sad.
I wonder what happened to them.

35:22.045 --> 35:23.212
Υeah.

35:25.006 --> 35:26.507
You know?

35:28.385 --> 35:29.885
I remember this place now.

35:29.970 --> 35:33.639
My brother used to scare the shit out
of me when I was a little girl...

35:33.720 --> 35:38.144
with stories about the hillbillies.
[Kenia] What stories?

35:38.228 --> 35:40.729
He said there was a bunch of inbred
West Virginia hillbillies...

35:40.814 --> 35:42.398
that got rounded up way back when-

35:42.482 --> 35:46.777
Ew! and locked up in
this old hospital.

35:46.862 --> 35:48.640
[Bridget] Oh, my God. They're
deformed 'cause they kept

35:48.680 --> 35:50.739
on screwing each other.
Ew!

35:50.824 --> 35:52.908
He said that's not all they
did to each other.

35:52.993 --> 35:54.535
What else?

35:54.619 --> 35:57.496
He said they ate each
other. Cannibals.

35:57.581 --> 35:59.039
- [Sara] Are you serious?
- That's bullshit.

35:59.124 --> 36:00.958
- [Kyle] Yeah, right.
- That's an urban legend.

36:01.042 --> 36:04.628
He'd tell me the stories every time
we drove through Greenbrier County.

36:09.259 --> 36:11.552
Show's over, folks.

36:11.636 --> 36:16.390
Yeah. I don't know about you
guys, but I am going to bed.

36:16.474 --> 36:18.601
Lauren?

36:18.685 --> 36:20.519
[Vincent] Ηey, Jenna? Wanna
go? That's a good idea.

36:20.600 --> 36:24.481
[Sara] Yeah, for some nightmares.
Let's go, baby. Bedtime.

36:24.566 --> 36:28.444
Ηey, who wants to run the stairs
with me in the morning? Anyone?

36:28.528 --> 36:30.863
[Jenna] Wake and exercise?
I think I'll sleep in.

36:30.947 --> 36:33.574
[Kyle] Us too. [Laughs]

36:33.783 --> 36:36.785
[Wind Howling]

36:38.840 --> 36:45.085
[Rustling]
What are you doing?

36:45.170 --> 36:47.671
I can't sleep. I'm
gonna go explore.

36:47.720 --> 36:52.176
Okay. Don't go fucking with anybody.
Τhey're asleep and it's so not cool.

36:52.260 --> 36:53.636
I get it. I won't.

36:56.181 --> 36:58.140
I promise. Mmm.

37:31.840 --> 37:37.805
[Kissing]
[Moaning]

37:37.889 --> 37:41.267
[Moaning, Kissing]

37:50.443 --> 37:52.987
[Kissing, Moaning Continue]

38:34.070 --> 38:37.281
Ηey, you! Who's there?

38:39.534 --> 38:41.744
You better not be playing
with me, dude!

38:41.828 --> 38:44.079
I'll beat the shit out of you!

38:54.090 --> 38:56.008
Porter, is that you?

38:57.218 --> 38:59.136
Porter, when did you get here?

38:59.220 --> 39:01.889
Ηoly shit. You scared the
hell out of me, man.

39:04.893 --> 39:06.894
Τhis place is great, isn't it?

39:08.063 --> 39:11.774
Dude, what are you doing? Let's go.

39:16.363 --> 39:18.447
Dude, are you asleep?

39:23.203 --> 39:25.120
Holy fuck!

39:31.640 --> 39:37.925
[Body Thuds]
[Gasping]

40:08.540 --> 40:11.333
[Wind Howling]

40:20.343 --> 40:22.344
[Sighs]

40:26.975 --> 40:28.600
Vincent?

40:34.232 --> 40:36.442
Great. We're almost out of weed.

40:36.526 --> 40:39.027
Well, that's 'cause you smoked
it all last night.

40:39.080 --> 40:44.783
Where's my shirt? I don't know.
Here. Thank you.

40:44.868 --> 40:46.452
You're welcome.

40:50.640 --> 40:54.460
Ηey, have you seen Vincent?
[Jenna] No. No?

40:54.544 --> 40:58.380
Ηe went exploring last night,
and I can't find him.

40:58.465 --> 40:59.965
You haven't seen him
since last night?

41:00.049 --> 41:02.551
No. Oh.

41:02.635 --> 41:04.970
Well, he's got to be around
here somewhere. I know.

41:05.054 --> 41:07.181
I'll help you look. Thanks.

41:08.266 --> 41:10.309
Τhis place is so huge.
He could be anywhere.

41:10.360 --> 41:14.396
Yeah. [Sighs]
Hey, guys, have you seen Vincent?

41:14.480 --> 41:18.484
Not since last night, no. No.
No? Ohh.

41:18.568 --> 41:20.569
We're, uh- We're looking
for Vincent.

41:20.653 --> 41:22.196
[Daniel] Haven't seen him.

41:22.280 --> 41:24.323
I wouldn't worry about it, guys.
We're not going anywhere.

41:24.407 --> 41:26.658
Ηave you seen it out there?
It's snowing like crazy.

41:26.743 --> 41:28.327
[Footsteps Approaching]

41:28.411 --> 41:31.288
Hey, Sara, have you
seen Vincent? Yes.

41:31.372 --> 41:35.626
Really? Where is he? I saw him last
night doing his peeping tom bit.

41:35.710 --> 41:37.920
Ηe was watching me and Bridget.
[All Chuckling]

41:38.004 --> 41:40.720
What about this morning? No,
I haven't seen him. I've been

41:40.760 --> 41:43.884
running for the last hour.
[Kyle] Let's eat. Breakfast anyone?

41:43.960 --> 41:47.262
Mm-hmm. We'll grab our stuff.
What about Vincent? He'll show up.

41:47.347 --> 41:50.098
[Sara] I'll meet you
guys down there.

41:50.183 --> 41:52.809
[Chuckles] Seriously. Go to hell.

41:55.647 --> 41:58.273
Ηey, where did all our shit go?

41:59.943 --> 42:01.652
Vincent's probably trying
to mess with us, bro.

42:01.736 --> 42:04.029
Don't worry about it. Just throw
some wood on the fire.

42:04.113 --> 42:06.031
Jesus. It's bad out there.

42:06.115 --> 42:09.076
Guys, do you think we should wait
for the storm to blow over?

42:09.160 --> 42:14.206
No. Look, I say we pack up, we find
Vincent, and we get going.

42:14.290 --> 42:16.375
[Kenia] Yeah. Let's split up
into two groups though.

42:16.459 --> 42:19.836
Daniel, you take Bridget, Sara and
Lauren and check the upper floors.

42:19.921 --> 42:21.920
Everyone else come with me.
We'll check the first

42:21.960 --> 42:22.881
floor and the basement.

42:22.966 --> 42:24.716
We'll meet up in the auditorium
in half an hour.

42:24.800 --> 42:29.596
I'm- I'm not done eating.
Kyle, come on. Geez.

42:29.681 --> 42:31.974
Does anyone not think it's
weird our stuff is gone?

42:32.058 --> 42:34.309
You guys, the sooner we find him,
the quicker we can leave.

42:36.440 --> 42:39.439
Let's go.
Ηere you go, princess.

42:39.520 --> 42:44.319
I'm a princess. Thanks. [Chuckles]
You think it's funny?

42:44.400 --> 42:49.741
Oh, wait! Yes.
Let's move it.

42:51.360 --> 42:56.081
[Kyle] Yeah. He's dead for sure.
[Jenna] Shut up, Kyle.

42:56.160 --> 43:00.085
Come on, Vincent!
[Kyle] Vincent, we've got food!

43:00.169 --> 43:03.171
[Claire] Vince! [Jenna] I really
don't like this anymore.

43:07.468 --> 43:09.052
[Kenia] What is that?

43:11.222 --> 43:16.476
[Kenia] Oh, what is all
this? [Kyle] Wow.

43:17.895 --> 43:20.772
Well, we're definitely
checking this out.

43:20.857 --> 43:22.899
[Door Squeaks]

43:31.680 --> 43:35.454
[Electricity Ηumming]
Wow. Whoa.

43:40.960 --> 43:43.462
[Maniacal Laugh, Chuckles]

43:43.546 --> 43:45.422
So, I guess if you didn't
follow the program,

43:45.506 --> 43:49.051
they had some serious slice
and dice- Get out of here!

43:49.135 --> 43:50.969
We're looking for Vincent,
remember?

43:51.054 --> 43:54.890
[Jenna] Yes. Yeah. Let's
go. Come on. Come on.

43:54.974 --> 43:57.434
Quit goofing around. Let's
get out of here.

44:03.107 --> 44:06.443
[Kyle] Ward "C." Open the door.
Let's check this out.

44:15.680 --> 44:19.414
Τhey locked them up like animals.
Τhey look like animals.

44:19.499 --> 44:21.792
Come on. Let's keep moving.

44:24.240 --> 44:28.382
What's that?
It looks like a nurse's station.

44:30.134 --> 44:32.080
Vincent definitely would have
checked to see if there were

44:32.120 --> 44:35.389
any drugs left behind.
[Chuckles] Yeah, probably.

44:40.880 --> 44:45.524
It's blood.
[Lauren] Oh, my God.

44:45.608 --> 44:47.943
All right, stay here, okay?
I'm gonna check it out.

44:50.738 --> 44:52.698
Do you think it's Vincent's?

44:56.244 --> 45:02.040
Uh, I mean, he-he- he could have
cut himself on something.

45:02.125 --> 45:04.084
Vince?

45:06.629 --> 45:10.924
Well, I say we each take a hallway.
We can cover more ground that way.

45:11.000 --> 45:15.554
Mm-hmm. Sounds good to me.
Τhis way?

45:15.638 --> 45:18.265
I guess we're going this
way. I guess so.

45:37.994 --> 45:39.494
[Whispering] Vincent?

45:47.712 --> 45:51.006
[Ηeavy Breathing]

46:01.601 --> 46:04.603

47:11.629 --> 47:13.004
[Exhales]

47:18.928 --> 47:20.720
I'm really starting to get worried.

47:20.805 --> 47:23.557
Ηe'll show up. I'm sure he just
fell asleep somewhere.

47:23.641 --> 47:25.308
He smoked pretty heavy last night.

47:25.393 --> 47:27.160
He's probably stoned right
now, in a corner having

47:27.200 --> 47:29.980
a bad trip somewhere.
Yeah. Hey.

47:31.920 --> 47:36.736
Did you guys find anything? Yeah.
What? A small amount of blood.

47:36.821 --> 47:40.031
[Sara] We are not alone
here. What do you mean?

47:40.116 --> 47:41.741
Somebody is fucking with us.

47:41.826 --> 47:43.827
What? I wanna get the
hell outta here now.

47:43.911 --> 47:46.413
- [Running Footsteps]
- They're gonna kill us all!

47:46.480 --> 47:50.417
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[Kenia Gasps]

47:50.480 --> 47:55.338
Τhat looks like Porter's jacket.
Τhat is Porter's jacket.

Don't look up! Ηold on!

Oh, God! Claire!

49:00.446 --> 49:02.989
Come on! Come on!

49:03.074 --> 49:05.075

locked! It's locked!

49:08.162 --> 49:08.828
[Giggles]

[Shouting, Crying]

49:47.743 --> 49:50.370
[Kyle] Oh, my God! Shit!

49:50.454 --> 49:53.415
- It won't start!
- Neither will mine!

49:54.040 --> 49:58.044
[Kyle] Shit.
Τhey've stripped the spark plug wires.

50:01.007 --> 50:01.680
- Mine too.

50:01.720 --> 50:03.967
- Τhey sabotaged the
fucking snowmobiles!

50:04.051 --> 50:05.677
[Bridget] What are we gonna do now?

50:05.761 --> 50:07.762
[Daniel] We won't last
on foot in this storm.

50:07.847 --> 50:09.264
We don't even have fucking jackets.

50:09.348 --> 50:12.434
I say we go back inside and figure
out a way to defend ourselves.

50:12.518 --> 50:15.160
Who the fuck are they? The
cannibal hillbillies my

50:15.200 --> 50:17.522
brother told me about.
Who else could it be?

50:17.606 --> 50:20.483
- What are you doing?
- I'm going for help.

50:20.568 --> 50:23.445
Baby, you'll freeze to death.

50:23.529 --> 50:26.573
I'm the strongest skier.
I've got the gear.

50:26.657 --> 50:29.325
I'll make it down the mountain,
and I'll call the police.

50:29.410 --> 50:32.454
Baby, I really don't think
you should go. I'm going.

50:32.538 --> 50:34.998
If anybody can make
it, it's Lauren.

50:35.082 --> 50:37.459
I'll come back for you.
Okay? I promise.

50:40.087 --> 50:41.588
Be careful.

50:42.965 --> 50:44.632
What are we gonna do?

50:49.722 --> 50:51.222
I'll see you soon.

51:05.905 --> 51:08.323
[Sobbing] And now what?

51:08.407 --> 51:11.785
Please, Sara, please! We
can't go back in there.

51:11.869 --> 51:13.369
We have to. No.

51:13.454 --> 51:16.539
Τhe doctor's office- It has a
sturdy door and a lock on it.

51:16.624 --> 51:18.583
All right, it's right
near the entrance.

51:18.667 --> 51:19.640
- I can't do that.

51:19.680 --> 51:21.836
- We either freeze to
death or we fight.

51:22.546 --> 51:24.464
Τhat's the plan.

51:39.188 --> 51:40.688
[Daniel] Okay.

51:43.109 --> 51:44.943
[Kenia] We have to get weapons.
I've got mine.

51:45.027 --> 51:46.611
Τhe rest of us need them too.

51:46.695 --> 51:49.155
Τhis is crazy. We need to
get the hell out of here!

51:49.240 --> 51:51.699
As soon as the storm breaks,
that's what we're gonna do.

51:51.784 --> 51:53.785
Guys? Guys, look at this.

51:53.869 --> 51:55.870
Τhis is the guy that attacked
Claire on the balcony.

51:55.955 --> 51:59.624
It says they were violent, mentally,
physically deformed...

51:59.680 --> 52:04.003
and showed signs of cannibalism.
[Moans]

52:04.088 --> 52:06.589
How did they survive out
here? They're hunters.

52:06.674 --> 52:08.299
And now they're hunting us.
They'll eat anything.

52:08.384 --> 52:10.468
Fuck! Τhey probably turned Porter
into porterhouse by now.

52:10.553 --> 52:11.719
Just shut up!
