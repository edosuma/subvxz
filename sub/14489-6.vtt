11:42.953 --> 11:44.538
No. Let's get hopped up.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.376
Greetings, eco-tourists!

11:49.460 --> 11:53.839
I am the grand butterfly curator...
This week.

11:53.923 --> 11:56.258
Yeah, yeah, you can teach us
to respect nature later.

11:56.342 --> 11:58.844
Right now, we've got
some flowers to suck dry.

11:58.928 --> 12:00.971
Suck them, burn them... As long
as they're not butterflies,

12:01.055 --> 12:02.473
I don't give a grand crap.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.016
But take heed!

12:04.099 --> 12:06.936
For you see,
it is mating season.

12:07.353 --> 12:11.065
Whatever you do, you must not
disturb the aggressive male.

12:11.148 --> 12:13.859
He can be identified
by his orange coloration

12:13.943 --> 12:16.153
and enormous butterjunk.

12:16.779 --> 12:18.989
What's he gonna do,
migrate at us? (LAUGHING)

12:20.032 --> 12:21.075
SHence!

12:21.158 --> 12:23.369
I can't be
specific about the danger,

12:23.452 --> 12:24.536
since if something
different happens,

12:24.620 --> 12:26.538
I might be liable for damages.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.374
But believe me,

12:28.457 --> 12:33.337
you'll rue the day you came
to the Butterfly Preserve.

12:33.671 --> 12:35.506
Well, enjoy the
Butterfly Preserve.

12:35.589 --> 12:36.632
Okay, bye.

12:36.715 --> 12:37.883
Come on, come on.

12:37.967 --> 12:40.594
Let's find those flowers.
We'll split into teams.

12:40.678 --> 12:42.179
You mean couples?

12:42.471 --> 12:43.472
Eh? Eh?

12:44.932 --> 12:46.517
Nice job smacking Kif.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.227
Dude had it coming. Wait.

12:48.310 --> 12:50.354
(SNIFFS)
I think I smell Nectar.

12:50.437 --> 12:52.356
Way ahead of you!

12:53.190 --> 12:54.191
(GULPING)

12:56.026 --> 12:58.153
I don't even know
why we're helping find

12:58.237 --> 13:00.823
an addictive drug for
our mean girlfriends.

13:00.906 --> 13:02.658
Quiet, they'll hear you.

13:04.034 --> 13:04.994
(HISSING)

13:05.077 --> 13:06.120
(CRYING OUT IN FEAR)

13:06.203 --> 13:08.497
The male butterfly.
It's gorgeous!

13:08.580 --> 13:10.207
Let me get my
butterfly hammer.

13:10.291 --> 13:11.417
Bender, no.

13:11.500 --> 13:14.628
That park ranger explicitly
gave us a vague warning.

13:14.712 --> 13:17.298
Look, the hammer's already
out, I got to smash something.

13:17.381 --> 13:18.716
(GROWLING)

13:26.015 --> 13:27.016
(SCREAMING)

13:28.726 --> 13:30.227
(SPLUTTERING)

13:35.399 --> 13:36.442
(GROANS IN DISGUST)

13:36.525 --> 13:40.237
It smells like a skunk
stuffed with feta cheese.

13:40.904 --> 13:42.114
(MOANING)
P.U.!

13:42.197 --> 13:44.033
Thank God I don't have a nose.

13:48.245 --> 13:50.331
We can sleep at
my parents' house.

13:50.414 --> 13:52.583
I'll just buzz and let
them know we're here.

13:53.417 --> 13:55.127
(BUZZING)

13:56.003 --> 13:58.464
Mom,
Dad, I'm sure you remember

13:58.547 --> 14:03.135
Fry, Leela, Bender, and of
course my Fonfon Ru, Amy.

14:03.218 --> 14:05.304
KIF'S MOTHER:
Welcome to our home.

14:05.387 --> 14:06.972
KIF'S FATHER:
One of you stinks.

14:07.056 --> 14:08.015
That'd be me.

14:08.098 --> 14:10.893
Wait, you're flies.
Don't you eat excrement?

14:11.060 --> 14:13.687
KIF'S FATHER: That's a day at
the beach compared to this.

14:13.771 --> 14:16.982
Listen, I'm just gonna shower
this stuff off and go to bed.

14:17.066 --> 14:19.276
Wait.
Don't take a shower, Fry.

14:19.443 --> 14:21.111
You smell kind of nice.

14:21.195 --> 14:22.196
(INHALES DEEPLY)

14:22.279 --> 14:24.365
Smell... Yeah. Huh?

14:24.448 --> 14:26.116
KIF'S FATHER: No hanky-panky.

14:26.200 --> 14:28.952
Everyone sleep
in separate rooms.

14:29.119 --> 14:30.662
Good night, Kif.

14:30.788 --> 14:32.456
Night, Fry.
Huh?

14:36.210 --> 14:37.795
Keep your door
unlocked tonight.

14:37.878 --> 14:41.590
But McGruff the Crime Dog
says... Oh!

14:48.639 --> 14:50.641
(BOTH SNORING)

14:54.395 --> 14:55.562
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

14:55.646 --> 14:57.606
Come in.

15:03.278 --> 15:04.279
(KISSING SOUNDS)

15:04.405 --> 15:05.406
(FRY GIGGLING)

15:07.658 --> 15:09.201
Hey, smelly-pants.

15:09.284 --> 15:10.452
Leela!

15:10.536 --> 15:11.578
Leela?

15:11.662 --> 15:13.080
Amy?
Amy!

15:13.163 --> 15:16.500
I'm done polishing my ass, Fry.
Here's your toothbrush back.

15:16.625 --> 15:17.626
(GASPING)

15:19.461 --> 15:20.462
(SCREAMING)

15:27.094 --> 15:29.596
You just hop into
bed with my boyfriend?

15:29.680 --> 15:30.681
And you!

15:30.764 --> 15:33.684
As God is my witness, lWlnever
forgive you for this!

15:36.186 --> 15:38.063
Hey, just 'cause
he's your boyfriend

15:38.147 --> 15:39.982
doesn't mean you get
him all to yourself.

15:41.525 --> 15:44.194
He's mine! There's nothing
more to talk about.

15:44.695 --> 15:46.113
No, no, keep talking.

15:46.196 --> 15:48.574
Amy, I hope I'm not
out of line, but...

15:48.657 --> 15:49.700
Shut up,KW.

15:49.825 --> 15:52.286
How dare you talk
that way to my Kif?

15:54.955 --> 15:56.957
This planet's got it going on.

15:59.960 --> 16:03.297
Sweet orgy of Georgia!
Have you girls gone wild?

16:03.380 --> 16:05.048
That's Fry you're macking on.

16:05.382 --> 16:06.758
(SNIFFING)

16:07.885 --> 16:11.513
Hmm. it seems Fry's
inexplicable sex appeal

16:11.597 --> 16:14.933
is due to the butterfly
pheromone he was sprayed with.

16:15.100 --> 16:18.353
But Amy and Leela aren't butterflies.
Right?

16:18.437 --> 16:21.482
No, but thanks to
the damned butterfly nectar

16:21.565 --> 16:24.109
they've been swilling,
they might as well be.

16:24.693 --> 16:25.694
(BURPING)

16:25.777 --> 16:30.032
The nectar causes their bodies to
produce female butterfly hormones,

16:30.115 --> 16:32.117
building up their
flapping muscles,

16:32.201 --> 16:35.412
but also making them
irresistibly attracted to Fry.

16:35.496 --> 16:36.497
(EXASPERATED SIGH)

16:36.580 --> 16:38.790
The only way to
end this madness

16:38.916 --> 16:41.168
is for the ladies
to quit, cold turkey.

16:41.835 --> 16:44.213
Whoa, whoa. Let's not
shock their system.

16:44.296 --> 16:46.465
Maybe they could
just go warm turkey?

16:46.590 --> 16:48.383
No, the Professor's right.

16:48.467 --> 16:49.760
We have to quit the Nectar.

16:49.885 --> 16:52.554
I agree.
This has to stop.

16:55.849 --> 16:56.850
Oh...

16:57.643 --> 16:59.520
My guts feel kind of weird.

16:59.603 --> 17:00.812
I'm not surprised.

17:00.938 --> 17:03.565
Those pheromones were
highly concentrated.

17:03.649 --> 17:07.694
Oh, I think I'm
getting a little caterpilly.

17:17.829 --> 17:20.540
All right,
let's get this party ended.

17:24.586 --> 17:25.587
(BOTH MOANING)

17:36.139 --> 17:38.475
We did it!
We kicked Nectar's butt!

17:38.642 --> 17:39.643
(ALL CHEER)

17:39.726 --> 17:40.811
I don't give a crap!

17:40.978 --> 17:45.399
Kif, I'm sorry for making out
with Fry so loud and often.

17:45.482 --> 17:49.152
It's all right, dearest. I know
it was just the Nectar talking.

17:49.236 --> 17:50.529
And groping-

17:51.071 --> 17:54.157
Well, looks like Fry's three-way
is down to a one-way.

17:54.241 --> 17:55.325
If he's lucky.

17:55.492 --> 17:57.494
Hey, where is Fry?

18:04.960 --> 18:07.212
<i>Amy, Leela! What are you doing
at your place of work?</i>

18:07.337 --> 18:09.339
<i>Your match with the Murderflies
is about to start.</i>

18:09.464 --> 18:10.465
(GASPING)

18:15.596 --> 18:19.349
<i>ANNOUNCER: Moon-ladies and moon-men,
presenting the defending champions,</i>

18:19.433 --> 18:22.185
<i>the queens of hostility
from the Sea of Tranquility,</i>

18:22.311 --> 18:24.688
<i>the Murderflies!</i>

18:28.567 --> 18:31.695
<i>And now their opponents,
the vixens most horrible</i>

18:31.862 --> 18:34.781
<i>from the big blue marble,
the WingNuts.</i>

18:36.241 --> 18:38.493
Everybody kill everybody!

18:38.869 --> 18:40.787
Well, we're not on
the juice anymore,

18:40.871 --> 18:42.623
but what's
the worst that can happen?

18:42.789 --> 18:47.210
<i>Since this is a championship match,
we are gonna need some lava!</i>

18:48.629 --> 18:51.089
Wait. Hot lava?

18:53.800 --> 18:55.969
Amy, if we get killed,
I just want to say

18:56.053 --> 18:58.347
it's been an honor riding the
roller coaster of addiction

18:58.430 --> 19:01.058
and recovery
with you, as a team.

19:01.600 --> 19:02.601
Ah!

19:03.226 --> 19:04.227
(BOTH YELLING)

19:13.570 --> 19:15.322
How could this
not be hurting you?

19:15.405 --> 19:17.658
I once killed a sea
turtle with these boots.

19:20.494 --> 19:21.745
Hold me.

19:25.791 --> 19:26.792
(SCREAMING)

19:29.586 --> 19:30.587
(SCREAMING)

19:31.588 --> 19:33.256
(ALL GASPING)

19:46.687 --> 19:48.563
Oh, no.
Oh, no.

19:48.689 --> 19:50.148
Make a wish.

19:58.448 --> 19:59.449
(CROWD GASPING)

19:59.616 --> 20:00.951
My God!

20:01.076 --> 20:04.454
Fry has metamorphosed
into a gigantic butterfly!

20:04.579 --> 20:07.416
He's even more
beautiful than before!

20:07.582 --> 20:08.959
(WHIMPERING)

20:10.335 --> 20:12.087
(SNIFFING) Ah!

20:12.337 --> 20:14.798
What is that sexy stink?

20:17.551 --> 20:20.220
FARNSWORTH: Oh, cripes!
They're mating!

20:20.429 --> 20:21.430
(CROWD GROANING)

20:21.888 --> 20:23.181
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>

20:23.265 --> 20:26.184
<i>I am so sorry for
allowing this lurid sex act</i>

20:26.268 --> 20:27.894
<i>to taint
an otherwise delightful</i>

20:27.978 --> 20:29.646
<i>day of
family-friendly violence.</i>

20:31.481 --> 20:34.651
That is some freaky
bug-on-bug action.

20:34.735 --> 20:36.403
I feel a little left out.

20:40.157 --> 20:41.491
(GROANING)

20:42.159 --> 20:43.910
ls Fry going to be okay?

20:43.994 --> 20:45.370
I don't think so.

20:45.454 --> 20:47.914
He's grown all these
strange insect parts,

20:47.998 --> 20:50.834
and he has
absolutely no brain activity.

20:52.085 --> 20:55.130
Look! He lost
the strange insect parts.

20:55.547 --> 20:56.548
(MOANING)

20:58.341 --> 20:59.593
He's back to normal!

21:00.010 --> 21:01.011
ALL: Yay!
