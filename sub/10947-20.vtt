00:04.840 --> 00:06.260
<i>Earth...</i>

00:06.840 --> 00:08.510
<i>Fire...</i>

00:08.890 --> 00:10.350
<i>Air.</i>

00:11.220 --> 00:15.140
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

00:15.310 --> 00:19.270
<i>Then, everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

00:19.980 --> 00:22.400
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

00:22.480 --> 00:23.690
<i>could stop them.</i>

00:23.780 --> 00:25.280
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

00:25.360 --> 00:26.610
<i>he vanished.</i>

00:27.320 --> 00:28.700
<i>100 years passed,</i>

00:28.780 --> 00:30.870
<i>and my brother and I
discovered the new Avatar―</i>

00:30.950 --> 00:32.580
<i>an airbender named Aang.</i>

00:32.910 --> 00:34.950
<i>And although
his airbending skills are great,</i>

00:35.040 --> 00:37.660
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

00:37.750 --> 00:38.870
AANG: Oof.

00:38.960 --> 00:41.790
<i>But I believe Aang can save the world.</i>

01:02.650 --> 01:04.400
KATARA: I can't believe I lost him.

01:04.480 --> 01:06.280
SOKKA: You did everything you could.

01:06.690 --> 01:08.150
And now we need to
do everything we can

01:08.240 --> 01:09.610
to get him back.

01:09.700 --> 01:10.860
Zuko can't have gotten far.

01:10.950 --> 01:12.070
We'll find him.

01:12.530 --> 01:13.780
Aang's gonna be fine.

01:13.870 --> 01:14.870
Ok.

01:19.750 --> 01:20.790
It's all right.

01:20.870 --> 01:21.920
You stay here, Momo―

01:22.000 --> 01:23.380
In case Aang comes back.

01:23.460 --> 01:24.460
Yip, yip!

01:49.440 --> 01:51.860
MAN: Om.

01:52.610 --> 01:54.280
Om.

01:54.370 --> 01:55.700
Hello?

01:55.780 --> 01:57.040
I'm sorry to disturb you.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.540
I just really need to find

01:58.620 --> 01:59.750
the moon and the ocean spirits.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.000
Go away.

02:04.750 --> 02:06.090
You're still here?

02:06.170 --> 02:07.250
Yes, I need―

02:07.340 --> 02:09.550
Om!

02:10.050 --> 02:11.760
Perhaps that thing will help you.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.010
Chase it!

02:14.640 --> 02:15.640
( SIGHS )

02:15.720 --> 02:16.720
Finally.

02:22.560 --> 02:23.650
( SCREAMS )

02:25.060 --> 02:26.060
Come back!

02:28.860 --> 02:30.740
Hello, Aang.

02:30.820 --> 02:31.900
Roku?!

02:39.370 --> 02:40.830
Huh?!

02:40.910 --> 02:43.000
( GASPING )

02:56.840 --> 02:57.850
Shelter!

03:08.980 --> 03:11.230
Roku, the water tribe is under attack!

03:11.320 --> 03:13.650
I need to find
the ocean and the moon spirits.

03:15.360 --> 03:18.780
The ocean and the moon
are ancient spirits―

03:19.080 --> 03:21.410
They crossed over
from the spirit world

03:21.490 --> 03:24.790
to the mortal world
very near the beginning.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.250
There is only one spirit I know of

03:27.500 --> 03:30.040
who is old enough to remember...

03:30.130 --> 03:31.340
Who?

03:31.420 --> 03:34.130
The spirit's name is Koh,

03:34.220 --> 03:36.130
but he is very dangerous―

03:36.680 --> 03:39.850
They call him the Face Stealer.

03:40.390 --> 03:41.760
When you speak with him,

03:41.850 --> 03:43.930
you must be very careful

03:44.020 --> 03:45.940
to show no emotion at all―

03:46.100 --> 03:48.940
Not the slightest expression―

03:49.020 --> 03:51.690
Or he will steal your face.

04:11.000 --> 04:12.250
I finally have you,

04:12.920 --> 04:15.590
but I can't get you home
because of this blizzard.

04:15.670 --> 04:17.130
There's always something.

04:17.720 --> 04:19.340
Not that you would understand.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.390
You're like my sister.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.560
Everything always came easy to her.

04:23.640 --> 04:25.600
She's a firebending prodigy...

04:25.680 --> 04:27.440
And everyone adores her.

04:27.770 --> 04:29.730
My father says she was born lucky.

04:29.810 --> 04:32.060
He says I was lucky to be born.

04:33.440 --> 04:34.480
I don't need luck, though―

04:34.570 --> 04:36.190
I don't want it.

04:36.530 --> 04:38.070
I've always had to struggle and fight,

04:38.150 --> 04:39.910
and that's made me strong...

04:39.990 --> 04:41.660
It's made me who I am.

05:12.100 --> 05:13.360
IROH: I don't need to remind you

05:13.440 --> 05:14.610
we have a time limit.

05:15.190 --> 05:16.860
If we don't defeat the water tribe

05:16.940 --> 05:18.820
before the full moon rises,

05:18.900 --> 05:20.700
they will be undefeatable.

05:20.780 --> 05:21.990
I assure you―

05:22.070 --> 05:23.740
I have everything under control.

05:24.030 --> 05:26.790
I intend to remove
the moon as a factor.

05:27.120 --> 05:28.370
Remove the moon?

05:28.450 --> 05:29.580
How?

05:29.660 --> 05:31.000
Admiral Choi!

05:32.580 --> 05:34.500
Prepare to meet your fate!

05:35.460 --> 05:37.170
Whoa!

05:37.260 --> 05:38.260
( SPLASH )

05:38.340 --> 05:39.760
As I was saying.

05:40.220 --> 05:41.840
Years ago, I stumbled upon

05:41.930 --> 05:43.970
a great and powerful secret―

05:44.510 --> 05:47.600
The identity of the moon spirit's
mortal form.

05:48.020 --> 05:49.020
What?!

05:49.350 --> 05:50.430
I was a young lieutenant

05:50.520 --> 05:52.690
serving under General Xu
in the Earth Kingdom.

05:53.440 --> 05:54.980
<i>I discovered a hidden library―</i>

05:55.060 --> 05:56.480
<i>Underground, in fact.</i>

05:56.900 --> 05:59.530
<i>I tore through scroll after scroll.</i>

05:59.780 --> 06:02.660
<i>One of them contained
a detailed illustration―</i>

06:02.740 --> 06:05.700
<i>And the words "moon" and "ocean."</i>

06:06.030 --> 06:08.700
<i>I knew then that these spirits
could be found...</i>

06:08.790 --> 06:10.250
<i>And killed...</i>

06:11.460 --> 06:13.880
And that it was my destiny to do so.

06:14.080 --> 06:17.000
Zhao, the spirits
are not to be trifled with!

06:17.460 --> 06:21.510
Yes, yes, I know
you fear the spirits, Iroh―

06:21.590 --> 06:22.880
I have heard rumors about your journey

06:22.970 --> 06:24.890
into the spirit world.

06:24.970 --> 06:27.140
But the ocean and moon
gave up their immortality

06:27.220 --> 06:29.310
to become a part of our world.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.520
And now they will
face the consequences.

06:49.080 --> 06:50.620
( CHATTERING )

06:50.700 --> 06:52.200
( GASPS ) Phew!

06:52.620 --> 06:54.420
You're just a curly-tailed bluenose.

06:56.750 --> 06:58.000
( GASPS )

07:00.630 --> 07:02.130
Show no fear.

07:02.210 --> 07:04.010
Show no emotion at all.

07:17.730 --> 07:18.730
Hello?

07:18.810 --> 07:21.480
I'm looking for a spirit named Koh.

07:34.580 --> 07:35.790
Welcome.

07:38.630 --> 07:39.710
Thank you.

07:39.790 --> 07:42.670
My old friend, the Avatar―

07:43.090 --> 07:45.720
It's been a long time.

07:45.800 --> 07:47.010
You know me?

07:47.470 --> 07:49.800
How could I forget you?

07:49.890 --> 07:51.510
One of your previous incarnations

07:51.600 --> 07:53.100
tried to slay me―

07:53.180 --> 07:55.810
Maybe 800 or 900 years ago.

07:56.350 --> 07:57.770
I didn't know that.

07:58.770 --> 08:01.900
Why did he― Or I― Try to kill you?

08:02.400 --> 08:04.570
Oh, it was something about

08:04.650 --> 08:06.610
stealing the face
of someone you loved.

08:11.660 --> 08:13.370
( LAUGHING )

08:14.500 --> 08:17.250
Of course, that's all behind us.

08:17.580 --> 08:19.250
Why should I hold a grudge against you

08:19.330 --> 08:20.710
for something in a past life?

08:21.250 --> 08:23.500
After all―
You're a different person now.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.880
You've come to me with a new face.

08:32.510 --> 08:34.140
Guess we'll be here awhile.

08:37.600 --> 08:38.640
YUE: Don't worry.

08:38.730 --> 08:39.940
Prince Zuko can't be getting too far

08:40.020 --> 08:41.440
in this weather.

08:41.900 --> 08:44.110
I'm not worried
they'll get away in the blizzard.

08:44.530 --> 08:46.190
I'm worried that they won't.

08:46.280 --> 08:48.070
SOKKA: They're not gonna
die in this blizzard.

08:48.150 --> 08:50.740
If we know anything,
it's that Zuko never gives up.

08:51.120 --> 08:53.870
They'll survive― And we'll find them.

08:54.450 --> 08:55.830
It's been a long time

08:55.910 --> 08:58.910
since I've added
a child's face to my collection.

08:59.290 --> 09:00.290
So...

09:00.580 --> 09:02.330
How may I help you?

09:02.590 --> 09:05.000
AANG: I need to find
the moon and the ocean.

09:05.210 --> 09:08.840
Their spirit names
are "Tui" and "La―"

09:09.430 --> 09:11.800
Push and pull.

09:11.890 --> 09:13.720
And that has been the nature

09:13.800 --> 09:16.350
of their relationship for all time.

09:16.520 --> 09:18.680
Please, help me find them.

09:19.270 --> 09:21.190
An entire culture could be destroyed

09:21.310 --> 09:22.810
if I don't get their help.

09:22.980 --> 09:25.900
Oh, you think you need their help?

09:26.110 --> 09:28.690
Actually, it's quite
the other way around.

09:29.570 --> 09:32.110
Someone is going to kill them!

09:32.360 --> 09:33.700
What do you mean?

09:33.910 --> 09:35.490
How can I find them and protect them?

09:36.120 --> 09:38.950
You've already met them, actually.

09:39.710 --> 09:43.540
Tui and La― Your moon and ocean―

09:43.880 --> 09:46.710
Have always circled each other
in an eternal dance.

09:47.000 --> 09:49.090
They balance each other:

09:49.170 --> 09:52.010
push and pull, life and death,

09:52.220 --> 09:54.550
good and evil...

09:54.760 --> 09:56.680
Yin and Yang.

10:01.100 --> 10:02.190
The koi fish!

10:04.610 --> 10:06.190
I must be going now.

10:06.980 --> 10:08.650
We'll meet again.

10:14.070 --> 10:15.490
The spirits are in trouble!

10:15.570 --> 10:17.200
I need to get back
to the physical world!

10:17.450 --> 10:20.870
A friend is here to guide you back.

10:20.960 --> 10:21.960
Hei Bai!

( SCREAMING )

10:41.060 --> 10:42.230
( SCREAMS )

11:12.840 --> 11:14.300
We'll be following this map

11:14.470 --> 11:16.140
to a very special location.

11:16.470 --> 11:18.180
And when we get there...

11:18.260 --> 11:20.350
We're going fishing.

11:24.270 --> 11:25.560
This is where I came in...

11:25.640 --> 11:27.190
But how do I get back?

11:34.860 --> 11:36.110
Good riddance.

11:37.950 --> 11:39.030
( SCREAMS )

11:41.370 --> 11:43.000
Momo!

11:43.330 --> 11:44.500
Momo?

11:44.580 --> 11:45.580
Oh, no...

11:45.870 --> 11:46.870
Where's my body?

11:54.170 --> 11:55.220
Look!

11:55.300 --> 11:56.300
That's got to be Aang!

11:56.380 --> 11:57.430
Yip, yip!

12:02.260 --> 12:03.270
Huh?!

12:04.100 --> 12:05.520
( STRAINING )

12:07.440 --> 12:08.440
Welcome back.

12:08.690 --> 12:09.690
Good to be back.

12:14.570 --> 12:16.320
( GRUNTING )

12:17.070 --> 12:18.950
That won't be enough to escape.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.780
Appa!

12:24.290 --> 12:25.290
Whoa!

12:25.370 --> 12:26.370
Here for a rematch?

12:26.750 --> 12:28.080
Trust me, Zuko,

12:28.250 --> 12:29.670
it's not going to be much of a match.

12:36.220 --> 12:38.680
Hey, this is some quality rope.

12:38.760 --> 12:40.220
We need to get to the oasis!

12:40.680 --> 12:41.850
The spirits are in trouble.

12:46.680 --> 12:48.850
Wait― We can't just leave him here.

12:49.400 --> 12:50.400
Sure, we can.

12:50.480 --> 12:51.480
Let's go.

12:51.560 --> 12:52.560
No.

12:52.650 --> 12:54.070
If we leave him, he'll die.

12:56.070 --> 12:57.700
( GRUNTS )

12:58.200 --> 12:59.530
SOKKA: Yeah, this makes
a lot of sense―

12:59.610 --> 13:02.280
Let's bring the guy
who's constantly trying to kill us.

13:25.510 --> 13:26.930
( SCREAMING )

13:33.360 --> 13:34.360
( GROANING )

13:34.440 --> 13:35.440
Are you ok?

13:35.520 --> 13:36.900
I feel faint.

13:37.070 --> 13:38.190
I feel it, too.

13:40.240 --> 13:42.030
The moon spirit is in trouble.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.410
I owe the moon spirit my life.

13:44.490 --> 13:45.490
What do you mean?

13:45.870 --> 13:47.040
When I was born,

13:47.120 --> 13:49.410
I was very sick and very weak.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.080
Most babies cry when they're born,

13:52.580 --> 13:54.670
<i>but I was born as if I were asleep,</i>

13:54.750 --> 13:56.090
<i>my eyes closed.</i>

13:56.420 --> 13:59.170
<i>Our healers did everything they could.</i>

13:59.550 --> 14:02.430
<i>They told my mother and father
I was going to die.</i>

14:03.260 --> 14:06.060
<i>My father pleaded
with the spirits to save me.</i>

14:06.680 --> 14:08.890
<i>That night― Beneath the full moon―</i>

14:08.970 --> 14:12.520
<i>He brought me to the oasis
and placed me in the pond.</i>

14:12.600 --> 14:14.690
<i>My dark hair turned white.</i>

14:15.190 --> 14:17.440
<i>I opened my eyes and began to cry...</i>

14:17.520 --> 14:18.730
Waah!

14:18.820 --> 14:20.190
<i>And they knew I would live.</i>

14:21.110 --> 14:23.320
That's why my mother named me Yue,

14:23.410 --> 14:24.660
for the moon.

14:27.910 --> 14:31.330
ZHAO: I am a legend now.

14:31.750 --> 14:33.540
The Fire Nation will for generations

14:33.620 --> 14:35.710
tell stories about the Great Zhao,

14:35.790 --> 14:37.750
who darkened the moon.

14:38.420 --> 14:41.300
They will call me
Zhao the Conqueror...

14:41.380 --> 14:43.430
Zhao the Moon-slayer...

14:43.760 --> 14:46.180
Zhao the Invincible!

14:46.260 --> 14:47.260
( CHITTERING )

14:47.350 --> 14:48.720
Get it off!

14:48.810 --> 14:49.890
Get it off!

14:58.730 --> 14:59.980
Don't bother.

15:01.900 --> 15:03.900
Zhao, don't!

15:04.360 --> 15:05.990
It's my destiny...

15:06.070 --> 15:08.240
To destroy the moon

15:08.330 --> 15:09.870
and the Water Tribe.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.370
Destroying the moon

15:11.450 --> 15:13.410
won't just hurt the Water Tribe,

15:14.080 --> 15:15.540
It will hurt everyone―

15:15.620 --> 15:16.920
Including you.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.670
Without the moon,

15:18.750 --> 15:20.710
everything would fall out of balance―

15:20.800 --> 15:23.090
You have no idea what kind of chaos

15:23.170 --> 15:24.550
that would unleash on the world.

15:24.800 --> 15:26.260
IROH: He's right, Zhao.

15:26.760 --> 15:28.470
General Iroh,

15:28.550 --> 15:30.220
why am I not surprised

15:30.310 --> 15:31.810
to discover your treachery?

15:32.020 --> 15:34.020
I'm no traitor, Zhao.

15:34.100 --> 15:36.310
The Fire Nation needs the moon, too.

15:36.400 --> 15:38.980
We all depend on the balance.

15:39.860 --> 15:41.980
Whatever you do to that spirit,

15:42.070 --> 15:44.610
I'll unleash on you tenfold!

15:44.900 --> 15:46.280
Let it go now!

15:55.710 --> 15:56.870
( YELLING )

16:04.590 --> 16:06.010
( GRUNTING )

16:14.060 --> 16:15.350
( GROANING )

16:28.030 --> 16:29.780
There's no hope now.

16:30.410 --> 16:31.620
It's over.

16:33.790 --> 16:34.790
No...

16:34.870 --> 16:35.950
It's not over.

17:52.240 --> 17:53.280
You're alive?!

17:53.530 --> 17:55.120
You tried to have me killed!

17:58.540 --> 17:59.710
Yes, I did.

18:00.210 --> 18:01.750
You're the Blue Spirit―

18:01.830 --> 18:03.830
An enemy of the Fire Nation!

18:04.330 --> 18:06.130
You freed the Avatar.

18:06.460 --> 18:07.590
I had no choice!

18:11.510 --> 18:14.010
You should have chosen
to accept your failure,

18:14.300 --> 18:15.890
your disgrace...

18:16.100 --> 18:18.680
Then at least you could have lived.

18:19.020 --> 18:20.680
( GRUNTING )

18:30.360 --> 18:31.650
It's too late―

18:32.400 --> 18:33.410
It's dead.

18:37.120 --> 18:39.540
You have been touched
by the moon spirit.

18:39.950 --> 18:42.040
Some of its life is in you.

18:42.370 --> 18:44.670
Yes, you're right...

18:44.880 --> 18:47.130
It gave me life.

18:47.920 --> 18:49.460
Maybe I can give it back.

18:50.630 --> 18:51.720
No!

18:51.800 --> 18:52.880
You don't have to do that.

18:53.470 --> 18:55.010
It's my duty, Sokka.

18:55.090 --> 18:56.600
I won't let you.

18:56.680 --> 18:58.810
Your father told me to protect you!

18:58.890 --> 19:00.060
I have to do this.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.360
( GASPS )

19:13.450 --> 19:14.450
No!

19:16.870 --> 19:18.030
She's gone.

19:18.410 --> 19:19.580
She's gone.

20:19.140 --> 20:20.930
Good-bye, Sokka.

20:21.390 --> 20:23.010
I'll always be with you.

20:54.050 --> 20:55.460
( GRUNTING )

21:03.100 --> 21:04.310
It can't be!

21:15.030 --> 21:16.070
Take my hand!

21:33.210 --> 21:35.710
I've decided to go to the South Pole.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.300
Some other benders and healers
want to join me.

21:38.380 --> 21:40.930
It's time we helped rebuild
our sister tribe.

21:41.550 --> 21:42.800
What about Aang?

21:42.890 --> 21:44.890
He still needs to learn waterbending.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.310
Well― Then he better get used to

21:47.390 --> 21:49.640
calling you Master Katara.

21:52.350 --> 21:54.480
The spirits gave me a vision

21:54.560 --> 21:55.860
when Yue was born.

21:56.190 --> 21:57.980
I saw a beautiful,

21:58.070 --> 22:02.410
brave young woman
become the moon spirit.

22:03.490 --> 22:04.910
I knew this day would come.

22:05.370 --> 22:06.700
You must be proud.

22:06.790 --> 22:08.370
So proud...

22:09.450 --> 22:10.460
And sad.

22:12.750 --> 22:15.250
IROH: I'm surprised, Prince Zuko,

22:15.460 --> 22:16.710
Surprised that you are not

22:16.800 --> 22:19.840
at this moment
trying to capture the Avatar.

22:20.670 --> 22:21.970
I'm tired.

22:22.050 --> 22:23.930
Then you should rest.

22:24.800 --> 22:26.720
A man needs his rest.

22:42.450 --> 22:44.070
( CHITTERING )

22:44.530 --> 22:45.820
You, too, Momo!

22:45.910 --> 22:46.910
Come here!

22:57.790 --> 23:00.260
Iroh is a traitor,

23:00.340 --> 23:03.130
and your brother Zuko is a failure.

23:03.680 --> 23:06.220
I have a task for you...
