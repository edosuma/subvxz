where he's being honored
by the Racing Hall of Fame. Remember?

01:41.893 --> 01:44.312
No, but I'll pretend I do
to make this go faster.

01:45.688 --> 01:49.943
I will be back in one week, just in time
for the grand reopening of Uncle Monty's.

01:51.236 --> 01:54.072
It is almost like I'm saying goodbye
to my racing-circuit life,

01:54.155 --> 01:56.574
and I'm saying hello to my sandwich life.

No, my Jackson.
I just got the letter from the school.

I didn't know he took the placement test.
I cannot wait to tell him the good news.

Mom, I'm in the middle of a game.

02:58.178 --> 02:59.929
Yeah, but it's really good news.

03:24.120 --> 03:25.955
Jackson's been like this all summer.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.541
I can barely get him to engage with me
about anything.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.835
All he wants to do
is play that video game.

03:30.919 --> 03:33.504
I have no idea
what's going on in his life.

03:33.588 --> 03:35.215
Well, he's a teenage boy.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.426
Communicating with his mother
is at the bottom of his list.

03:38.509 --> 03:40.803
Right next to cleaning his room
and showering.

03:43.056 --> 03:46.809
I don't know. Maybe you could,
you know, pick up some of his interests.

03:47.518 --> 03:49.562
Oh, no, I have to shower every day.

I don't know if I'd be good at that.

Ho ho, I am so good at this.

Why does that name sound so familiar?

04:11.834 --> 04:13.503
Hey, Doombuggy, how about a game?

04:17.173 --> 04:20.051
[lowers voice] It's Jackson.
That's why it sounds so familiar.

for the Rocket League<i> </i>NorCal finals?

we'd be spending a lot of time together?

Uh, long enough to know
that whatever this is is wrong, bro.

05:36.669 --> 05:38.421
Okay, I-I-I can explain.

05:38.504 --> 05:40.590
Are you gonna explain
in your regular voice...

05:40.673 --> 05:42.300
[gruff voice] or in this voice?

05:43.843 --> 05:46.220
I'm gonna explain
in my high-pitched nervous voice.

05:47.555 --> 05:50.183
I-I was learning to play
Jackson's video game,

05:50.266 --> 05:52.352
because I wanted
to spend more time with him,

05:52.435 --> 05:55.063
and then, all of a sudden,
he joined my game.

05:55.146 --> 05:57.899
And he started talking to me,
which he never does,

05:57.982 --> 06:01.235
and then I tried to sign off,
but he just kept talking,

06:01.319 --> 06:03.112
and-and I really liked it,

06:03.196 --> 06:04.864
and is that so wrong?

06:06.866 --> 06:09.035
Well, it doesn't sound right.

06:10.745 --> 06:13.122
I know it's not right.

06:13.206 --> 06:15.666
Ah, why didn't I just go with
not showering?

06:17.752 --> 06:18.836
What if he finds out?

06:18.920 --> 06:22.298
He won't because I am never
gonna play again.

06:23.424 --> 06:24.675
Except for one more time.

06:25.927 --> 06:29.430
Because I already promised I would,
and Doombuggy doesn't break a promise.

06:30.640 --> 06:32.141

is tomorrow,

and cancel the reopening.

Ladies, can I talk to you for a second?
I really need some advice.

12:50.936 --> 12:53.939
Yeah. Well, first, I'd ditch the blouse.

12:55.900 --> 12:56.901
Not helping.

12:58.152 --> 12:59.862
Okay, this is kind of insane,

12:59.945 --> 13:03.574
but I went online, and now Jackson
thinks I'm a 16-year-old boy,

13:03.657 --> 13:06.202
and I have to meet him in an hour
at an esports arena

13:06.285 --> 13:07.995
as my alter-ego Doombuggy.

13:10.748 --> 13:12.583
So, what's the insane part?

13:14.919 --> 13:17.463
So, when I said that you should start
playing video games

13:17.546 --> 13:21.217
to have a common interest with Jackson,
this is where you wound up?

13:21.300 --> 13:23.552
Well, I didn't set out to do this.

13:23.636 --> 13:27.598
And I did try to tell him,
but then, when he got into the tournament,

13:27.681 --> 13:29.850
he got so happy...

13:29.934 --> 13:32.520
and truth be told,
when he started opening up to me,

13:32.603 --> 13:34.438
I got really happy.

13:35.397 --> 13:37.066
Oh, I don't know what to do.

-I also have a costume for you. Come on.
-No, no, no.

13:47.201 --> 13:50.955

and do what you always do.

and accept the consequences.

we offered a Groupon for opening day

to the original 1972 prices.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.543
What a cool idea.

14:37.626 --> 14:41.046
Hey, we should buy a bunch of sandwiches.
They're gonna be so cheap.

14:41.130 --> 14:44.258
Huh. 1972 prices.

14:44.341 --> 14:46.844
That would mean a sandwich
we normally sell for $12

14:46.927 --> 14:49.972
we're gonna be selling for 82 cents.

14:50.055 --> 14:52.308
Right. I should've mentioned that.

there's a line around the block.

I-I-I don't mean to be a killjoy,

and we don't have enough ingredients
to feed all those people.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.529

we won't be able to honor our deal,

will be turned away,
