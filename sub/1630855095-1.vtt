WEBVTT

01:07.733 --> 01:09.042
What the fuck, Caleb?

01:09.178 --> 01:10.806
Oh, wait till you see
the shot I got.

01:10.942 --> 01:13.112
You looked like you were gonna
shit a brick out sideways.

01:13.248 --> 01:14.940
You could have taken
my head off.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.441
It wouldn't have been a clean
decapitation

01:16.576 --> 01:17.976
with these blades.

01:18.111 --> 01:20.013
You'd just scramble
your face up real good.

01:28.761 --> 01:31.163
Shouldn't you go see if
Jessica is feeling any better?

01:31.299 --> 01:33.093
She'll be fine.
I gave her Klonopin

01:33.228 --> 01:36.234
so she can sleep off whatever
the fuck is wrong with her.

01:36.370 --> 01:38.231
Girl is such a pain
in the ass.

02:04.160 --> 02:05.298
Jessica?

02:23.146 --> 02:24.510
Hey.

02:24.645 --> 02:25.978
How you feeling, cuz?

02:30.359 --> 02:32.583
Since none of these other
friends of yours

02:32.719 --> 02:34.660
bothered to show up,

02:34.795 --> 02:37.898
can I take your car and escape
the hell of being stuck here

02:38.033 --> 02:39.997
with your latest boyfriend?

02:44.696 --> 02:45.899
Great chat.

02:55.175 --> 02:56.677
You better wake up
in the next half hour

02:56.813 --> 02:59.351
or I'm gonna be forced
to go drown

02:59.487 --> 03:01.915
that brainless meat puppet's
sorry ass.

03:31.248 --> 03:34.288
"The intense horror
of my nightmare came over me."

03:35.552 --> 03:37.121
"I tried to draw back my arm

03:37.256 --> 03:39.358
but the hand clung on

03:39.493 --> 03:42.586
and a most melancholy
voice sobbed,

03:42.722 --> 03:43.961
'Let me in.'"

03:44.097 --> 03:45.299
"'Let me in!'"

03:47.034 --> 03:48.528
"As it spoke,

03:48.663 --> 03:50.700
I discerned, obscurely

03:50.835 --> 03:53.164
a child's face
looking through the window."

03:55.444 --> 03:56.800
"Finding it useless to attempt

03:56.936 --> 03:58.642
shaking the creature off,

03:58.777 --> 04:01.274
I pulled its wrist on to
the broken pane..."

04:01.409 --> 04:02.978
Jess?

04:03.113 --> 04:05.252
-"...and rubbed it
to and fro..."
-Please shut up.

04:05.387 --> 04:06.712
"...till the blood ran down

04:06.847 --> 04:08.751
and soaked the bedclothes."

04:08.886 --> 04:11.957
"Yet still it wailed,
'Let me in!'"

04:12.092 --> 04:13.426
Jessica!

04:37.678 --> 04:38.918
Shit, shit, shit!

04:39.053 --> 04:40.349
Shit, shit, shit!

04:43.949 --> 04:46.690
No, Jess. Jess? Jess?

05:06.145 --> 05:07.913
Who's the brainless
meat puppet now?

05:20.458 --> 05:21.454
Caleb.

05:21.590 --> 05:22.827
What the fuck?

05:24.856 --> 05:25.998
Oh, my God.

05:26.134 --> 05:27.324
What the hell happened?

05:30.971 --> 05:31.933
Jess?

05:35.371 --> 05:36.404
Jessica?

05:48.618 --> 05:50.253
What the fuck? What?

05:50.389 --> 05:52.151
No, no, no...

05:53.027 --> 05:54.351
Caleb!

05:55.622 --> 05:57.394
No...

06:00.936 --> 06:02.231
No, Caleb!

06:04.500 --> 06:05.300
Caleb!

07:09.400 --> 07:10.295
Beth!

07:12.141 --> 07:13.500
Beth, you in there?

07:15.542 --> 07:17.804
Just give me five, all right?

07:17.939 --> 07:19.476
Brandon is losing his shit.

07:19.612 --> 07:20.976
He can't find the Strat he won

07:21.111 --> 07:23.616
in that arm wrestling contest
last night.

07:23.751 --> 07:25.585
It's already tuned and racked
stage left

07:25.720 --> 07:28.148
like I told you it was
half an hour ago.

07:29.657 --> 07:31.283
You feeling all right
in there?

07:32.258 --> 07:33.951
I'm fine.

07:34.087 --> 07:36.220
Just go man your station.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.526
I'll be back before
curtains up.

07:38.661 --> 07:39.861
You got it, boss.

08:47.999 --> 08:49.560
Have you seen my favorite
black t-shirt?

08:49.695 --> 08:51.532
I need it for the Labor Day
protest tomorrow.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.434
Mom?

08:56.569 --> 08:59.102
You're not going to any
protest on your own.

08:59.238 --> 09:00.778
Sophie's dad's taking us.

09:00.914 --> 09:02.114
I've told you, like,
ten times already.

09:02.249 --> 09:03.849
Remember?

09:03.984 --> 09:05.245
Well, did you remember
to check the bathroom hamper?

09:09.250 --> 09:11.051
Tell Danny
to turn the music down.

09:11.187 --> 09:12.888
Mom says,
"Turn the music down!"

09:13.024 --> 09:14.590
I could've done that myself!

09:33.782 --> 09:36.441
Kassie, you better not have
my scissors.

09:39.046 --> 09:39.983
Don't got 'em, Mom!

09:43.950 --> 09:45.518
It's dirty.

09:45.653 --> 09:46.955
Well, stick it in the laundry,
and I'll do it later.

09:47.091 --> 09:48.924
You'll forget.
You always forget.

09:49.059 --> 09:51.461
You know where
the washing machine is.

09:58.463 --> 10:00.169
Hey, Bridget.
Mom's on nights

10:00.304 --> 10:02.172
and we're watching
all the Freddy movies in a row.

10:02.307 --> 10:05.140
-Even the shitty ones.
-There aren't any shitty ones.

10:06.572 --> 10:08.642
So, you, um,
wanna come over and...

10:08.777 --> 10:10.178
In your dreams.

10:23.289 --> 10:25.429
Your boyfriends are weirdos.

10:25.564 --> 10:26.762
You're the weirdo.

10:29.094 --> 10:31.434
Kassie!

10:46.546 --> 10:48.749
Big crowd in tonight, Dan?

10:51.187 --> 10:52.887
-Get out, Bridge!
-I would, but--

10:53.023 --> 10:54.651
Let me in!

11:06.398 --> 11:08.071
Somebody get that, please!

11:10.841 --> 11:12.509
All right, all right!

11:28.660 --> 11:30.159
Boo!

11:33.201 --> 11:34.060
Beth.

11:34.196 --> 11:36.194
-You bitch.

11:36.329 --> 11:37.595
-Surprise, sis.

11:39.904 --> 11:41.300
When did you get into town?

11:41.436 --> 11:44.470
I Uber'd straight here
from LAX.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.144
Hmm.

11:49.279 --> 11:52.144
You been sleeping?
You look like Mom.

11:52.279 --> 11:54.317
Beats looking like a tampon.

11:55.948 --> 11:58.121
You know, the downstairs
buzzer is totally busted.

11:58.257 --> 12:00.117
I was able to walk in
right off the street.

12:00.253 --> 12:01.551
Whole building's busted.

12:01.687 --> 12:03.494
It's getting knocked
in a month.

12:03.629 --> 12:04.956
You're kidding me.

12:05.091 --> 12:06.589
Nope. We're out.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.659
Have you guys found
a new place?

12:09.535 --> 12:11.563
Not yet.

12:11.698 --> 12:14.731
Shit, El. You and Jay
have been here forever.

12:16.203 --> 12:17.569
Was Bangkok awesome?

12:17.704 --> 12:20.611
Insane. Crazy, obsessive fans
over there.

12:20.747 --> 12:21.945
Did you drink snake blood?

12:22.081 --> 12:23.980
Hey,
that's culturally insensitive.

12:24.116 --> 12:25.642
What about
monkey brain barbecue?

12:25.778 --> 12:27.716
Oh, yeah.
That's so much better, Dan.

12:27.852 --> 12:28.948
Who's your friend, Kass?

12:29.084 --> 12:30.554
She's called Staffanie.

12:30.690 --> 12:33.426
Oh. Hey, Staffanie.

12:33.562 --> 12:35.490
What's her, uh, situation?

12:35.626 --> 12:39.295
Danny told me that when this
building used to be a bank,

12:39.430 --> 12:41.693
a teller got caught stealing
and hunged himself

12:41.828 --> 12:43.536
and if you walk around
with coins in your pockets,

12:43.671 --> 12:45.830
his ghost hears the jingle.

12:45.966 --> 12:48.534
And he scares you to death
so he can take all your money.

12:49.905 --> 12:51.378
It's true.

12:51.513 --> 12:53.108
If he comes after me,

12:53.244 --> 12:55.541
Staffanie will scare him
to death first.

12:56.683 --> 12:58.179
Ghosts aren't real.

12:58.314 --> 13:00.050
-Have you ever seen one?
-Mmm-mmm.

13:00.186 --> 13:02.145
Then how do you know
they don't exist?

13:02.280 --> 13:04.051
Because...

13:04.187 --> 13:07.324
I only believe what I can see.

13:07.460 --> 13:08.953
For me?

13:09.089 --> 13:13.128
-It's for badass
rock chicks only.

13:13.263 --> 13:16.861
Look, Mom. I'm a badass.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.702
Please don't indoctrinate her
into your groupie world.

13:19.837 --> 13:21.005
What's a groupie?

13:21.140 --> 13:22.667
Your mom's favorite
nickname for me,

13:22.802 --> 13:25.311
even though she knows
I'm a guitar technician.

13:25.447 --> 13:26.669
If you say so.

13:26.805 --> 13:29.272
Hey, be nice
or you don't get a gift.

13:29.407 --> 13:31.375
Speaking of which,

13:31.511 --> 13:33.645
check out what I got your dad.

13:43.532 --> 13:44.755
What's going on, El?

13:46.400 --> 13:49.397
Danny, go take my car and get
pizza with your sisters.

13:50.463 --> 13:51.663
Sure thing, Mom.

13:54.570 --> 13:57.502
I just can't wrap my head
around all this.

13:57.638 --> 13:59.439
What, did he meet
someone else?

13:59.574 --> 14:01.878
No. He believes paying
child support

14:02.014 --> 14:03.743
equals co-parenting from afar.

14:07.854 --> 14:09.712
Why didn't you tell me, El?

14:09.848 --> 14:11.624
I would've jumped
right on a plane

14:11.760 --> 14:13.421
to help you work through this.

14:16.058 --> 14:17.326
I called you.

14:18.399 --> 14:20.263
Twice.

14:20.398 --> 14:22.097
First time, when he told me
he was leaving.

14:22.232 --> 14:23.728
Second,
the night he moved out.

14:25.700 --> 14:27.908
That was two and half
months ago, Beth.

14:36.550 --> 14:38.084
I'm sorry, okay?

14:38.220 --> 14:40.217
You know when I'm on the road,
I get sucked in deep

14:40.353 --> 14:41.788
and I'm trying to make
chief tech right now.

14:41.924 --> 14:43.248
And if I do,
I'll be the first woman

14:43.384 --> 14:44.848
in my crew to do it, so...

14:47.361 --> 14:50.623
Please, Ellie, we need
to talk this through properly.

14:52.466 --> 14:53.791
El...

14:53.926 --> 14:56.063
Look, you can sleep
on the sofa tonight

14:56.199 --> 14:58.831
but I gotta pack and move.

15:29.203 --> 15:30.493
<i>Hey, Bethy-boo.</i>

15:30.629 --> 15:32.236
<i>It's Ellie. Just...</i>

15:33.908 --> 15:35.734
<i>calling to say hi. And, um...</i>

15:36.976 --> 15:38.506
<i>me and Jay, we, uh...</i>

15:40.643 --> 15:42.746
<i>-You know what--</i>

15:42.881 --> 15:44.784
I don't blame you.

15:44.919 --> 15:46.582
I hate the sound
of my voice too.

15:58.858 --> 16:00.396
What's going on with you,
Beth?

16:04.832 --> 16:06.897
I screwed up again,
like I always do.

16:08.472 --> 16:11.407
And I need you to help me
figure it out.

16:12.271 --> 16:13.211
Again.

16:14.209 --> 16:15.180
What happened?

16:17.012 --> 16:18.150
Mmm.

16:27.158 --> 16:28.551
Hurry up, Bridge.

16:28.686 --> 16:30.125
You wanna carry them?

16:30.260 --> 16:31.163
You wanna get your license?

16:33.158 --> 16:34.892
Come on, Kass.

16:47.115 --> 16:48.708
Earthquake!

16:57.382 --> 16:58.223
Come on.

17:01.320 --> 17:02.260
Go!

17:07.197 --> 17:08.398
Stay down!

17:23.243 --> 17:24.408
Shit.

17:24.543 --> 17:26.278
That was intense.

17:26.414 --> 17:28.121
I think I peed my pants.

17:29.415 --> 17:30.682
Is it warm?

17:32.527 --> 17:33.791
Mmm-mmm.

17:33.927 --> 17:35.194
It's probably just soda.

17:36.391 --> 17:37.559
All right. Come on.

17:54.414 --> 17:56.413
Holy shit.
Bridget, check this out.

17:57.278 --> 17:58.349
What is it?

17:59.610 --> 18:00.582
There's a hole.

18:10.661 --> 18:12.660
Careful, Dan.
There could be aftershocks.

18:24.076 --> 18:25.409
It's an old bank vault!

18:28.311 --> 18:29.809
Danny, don't!

19:00.373 --> 19:01.247
Dan?

19:09.716 --> 19:10.922
Come on, Danny. Let's go!

19:11.057 --> 19:12.324
Just hang on!

19:49.829 --> 19:51.390
Danny!

19:51.526 --> 19:52.925
Relax a minute, Bridge!

20:12.747 --> 20:14.445
Danny, are you okay?

20:14.580 --> 20:15.645
I'm fine.

21:24.816 --> 21:25.983
Anything?

21:26.119 --> 21:27.450
The network
is totally screwed.

21:28.591 --> 21:30.154
I'm sure they're fine, El.

21:34.235 --> 21:36.334
Hey.

21:36.470 --> 21:38.800
Is everyone okay?
Anybody hurt?

21:38.935 --> 21:41.273
Hey, Gabe.
The kids went to go get pizza

21:41.409 --> 21:42.605
and I can't get through
on their cells.

21:42.741 --> 21:43.835
Can I borrow your car
to go find them?

21:43.971 --> 21:45.504
-How about I drive you?
-Thanks.

21:45.640 --> 21:46.940
Let me get the keys.

21:55.321 --> 21:57.489
-Who are you?
-Beth.

21:58.519 --> 21:59.851
Ellie's sister.

21:59.986 --> 22:03.022
Ah, yeah, yeah.
The groupie.

22:04.858 --> 22:05.761
Let me ask you somethin'.

22:07.465 --> 22:08.757
Can you hear her up there?

22:08.893 --> 22:11.433
-What?
-Quake.

22:11.569 --> 22:13.032
Sent her hiding in the ducts.

22:15.671 --> 22:17.674
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

22:19.474 --> 22:21.046
Let's roll.

22:23.414 --> 22:25.681
Is that them?

22:25.817 --> 22:27.882
-Good to meet you.

22:30.415 --> 22:34.059
You never take the elevator
after a quake.

22:34.195 --> 22:37.189
Bridget dropped the pizza.

22:37.324 --> 22:40.763
Oh, honey. I love you guys
so much more than pizza.

22:50.201 --> 22:51.840
<i>The magnitude 5.5 earthquake</i>

22:51.976 --> 22:53.771
<i>hit just north</i>
<i>of the Puente Hills fault</i>

22:53.906 --> 22:55.071
<i>less than an hour ago.</i>

22:55.206 --> 22:56.712
<i>Jolting downtown Los Angeles</i>

22:56.848 --> 22:58.511
<i>and everywhere from</i>
<i>La Habra to...</i>

23:22.072 --> 23:24.774
You think it might
be worth something?

23:24.909 --> 23:26.637
Mom could do with some extra
money right now,

23:26.772 --> 23:28.307
don't you think?

23:28.443 --> 23:30.278
I don't think Mom wants cash
from something you stole.

23:30.413 --> 23:32.145
It's not stolen.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.149
It's probably been
locked in that vault forever.

23:34.285 --> 23:37.050
Yeah, and weird shit like this
gets locked away for a reason.

23:42.295 --> 23:43.419
Just leave it, Dan.

23:45.296 --> 23:46.994
Argh! Fuck!

23:47.761 --> 23:49.331
Let me see it.

23:49.466 --> 23:50.393
It's just a nick.

23:59.474 --> 24:00.403
Dan...

24:26.801 --> 24:27.705
Danny, please close it.

24:45.116 --> 24:46.392
I don't like this, Dan.

24:46.527 --> 24:49.027
You need to put it back
right now.

24:49.162 --> 24:51.892
Mom's not letting any of us
out the front door
again tonight.

24:52.028 --> 24:53.027
First thing in the morning
then.

24:54.365 --> 24:55.359
Promise me?

25:09.548 --> 25:11.714
You going deep sea diving?

25:11.850 --> 25:14.379
I gotta see under
before I get in.

25:14.514 --> 25:17.256
I got stung by a jellyfish
at the beach before.

25:17.392 --> 25:20.019
I don't like going underwater.

25:20.155 --> 25:22.018
I don't think
there's any weird

25:22.154 --> 25:23.728
sea creatures in the tub.

25:35.175 --> 25:36.398
Oh, my God!

25:36.534 --> 25:37.971
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

25:38.107 --> 25:40.603
-It's a... It's a...

25:55.195 --> 25:56.222
You okay?

25:57.264 --> 25:58.521
I'm good, sweetie.

26:02.362 --> 26:04.604
I hate when
my tummy hurts too.

27:01.061 --> 27:03.187
<i> Good afternoon,</i>
<i>my fellow clergymen.</i>

27:03.322 --> 27:05.261
<i>I am Father Marcus Littleton,</i>

27:05.397 --> 27:08.461
<i>the library keeper here</i>
<i>at Saint Patrick's Cathedral</i>

27:08.597 --> 27:11.532
<i>and I welcome you all today</i>

27:12.836 --> 27:15.006
<i>You've been invited here</i>

27:15.141 --> 27:18.175
<i>to witness the unveiling</i>
<i>of a unique artifact</i>

27:18.310 --> 27:21.236
<i>that was discovered</i>
<i>by our overseas missionaries.</i>

27:21.372 --> 27:23.147
<i>I would like to present</i>

27:23.283 --> 27:26.912
<i>what I believe to be one of</i>
<i>the three fabled volumes</i>

27:27.048 --> 27:28.848
<i>of Naturum Demonto,</i>

27:28.983 --> 27:31.218
The Book of the Dead.

27:33.725 --> 27:35.818
<i>My tests to date have revealed</i>

27:35.953 --> 27:39.392
<i>that its bindings</i>
<i>are made of cured human flesh,</i>

27:39.527 --> 27:42.224
<i>its passages and etchings</i>
<i>inked in blood.</i>

27:42.360 --> 27:43.769
<i> This is heresy!</i>

27:43.905 --> 27:45.705
<i> Today,</i>
<i>I seek church approval</i>

27:45.840 --> 27:47.968
<i>to translate</i>
<i>the spiritual mysteries</i>

27:48.103 --> 27:49.803
<i>its pages undoubtedly hold.</i>

27:49.938 --> 27:51.537
<i> Destroy it!</i>

27:51.673 --> 27:53.409
<i>It's called</i> The Book of
the Dead<i> for a reason!</i>

27:53.544 --> 27:56.371
<i> I seek to look at</i>
<i>this book for the good of man!</i>

28:15.499 --> 28:18.227
<i> Rejected by</i>
<i>the elders of our church,</i>

28:18.363 --> 28:21.263
<i>myself, Canon Damien Shanahan,</i>

28:21.398 --> 28:23.634
<i>and Father Hugo Cortez</i>

28:23.769 --> 28:25.604
<i>have been working in secret</i>

28:25.740 --> 28:29.807
The Book of the Dead's
<i>myriad writings and glyphs.</i>

28:29.943 --> 28:33.748
<i>Its pages contain ancient</i>
<i>rituals and incantations,</i>

28:33.884 --> 28:35.582

28:55.705 --> 28:59.702
<i> It is January 24th</i>

29:02.179 --> 29:04.376
<i>And I,</i>

30:40.644 --> 30:41.606
Hey!

30:42.581 --> 30:43.875
Help!

30:44.010 --> 30:45.284
Help!

31:33.798 --> 31:35.832
Shut the fuck up!

32:52.112 --> 32:55.372
It's okay. It's okay.

32:55.507 --> 32:56.543
It's just a blackout.

33:22.202 --> 33:23.207
Bridget?

33:24.040 --> 33:25.209
You all right?

33:25.842 --> 33:27.572
Yeah.

33:27.708 --> 33:29.444
Looks like it's just us
that's out.

33:31.881 --> 33:32.876
Really?

33:40.989 --> 33:41.951
Mom?

33:44.193 --> 33:45.196
El, are you sleeping?

33:48.933 --> 33:50.234
Where is she?

34:30.401 --> 34:31.407
Mom?

34:43.150 --> 34:44.156
El?

35:08.605 --> 35:10.314
What's up, sis?

35:15.717 --> 35:18.256
I had the most
beautiful dream.

35:20.251 --> 35:23.327
We were together,
sitting in a tall forest.

35:25.392 --> 35:26.758
The wind was clean

35:26.894 --> 35:28.761
and the birds were singing
the sweetest...

35:37.205 --> 35:38.474
Melodies.

35:40.172 --> 35:43.413
It was a perfect day
and all I could think about

35:43.548 --> 35:45.917
was how much I wanted
to cut you all open

35:46.052 --> 35:47.582
and climb inside your bodies

35:47.717 --> 35:50.046
so that we could stay
one happy family.

36:13.945 --> 36:14.880
It's in me.

36:46.772 --> 36:48.914
Don't let it take my babies.

36:58.285 --> 36:59.881
Mom!

37:00.017 --> 37:01.293
Bridget, take her back inside.

37:03.389 --> 37:04.593
Now!

37:08.058 --> 37:09.697
What's wrong with her, Bridge?

37:19.245 --> 37:21.874
Stairs. Go!
Go, go, go.

37:25.777 --> 37:26.910
Come on.

37:27.045 --> 37:28.752
Wake up, Ellie.
Come on, wake up.

37:28.887 --> 37:30.150
Danny!

37:30.286 --> 37:31.620
They're gone.

37:50.340 --> 37:52.003
One minute she was fine

37:52.138 --> 37:54.346
and the next
she was talking crazy and...

37:56.148 --> 37:57.547
And now she's gone.

38:20.964 --> 38:22.198
Network's still fucked.

38:27.309 --> 38:28.479
May I pray?

38:30.281 --> 38:31.944
She's not religious.

38:34.920 --> 38:35.816
Wasn't.

38:36.947 --> 38:38.390
It's just a few words.

38:40.057 --> 38:40.986
Join me.

38:53.033 --> 38:56.241
Eternal rest grant unto her,
O Lord

38:56.377 --> 38:58.740
and let perpetual light
shine upon her.

39:00.672 --> 39:02.073
May her soul

39:02.208 --> 39:04.576
and the souls
of all the faithful departed

39:04.712 --> 39:05.910
through the mercy of God--

39:06.046 --> 39:07.452
What the hell happened
to her face?

39:09.682 --> 39:10.719
Rest in peace.

39:12.656 --> 39:14.250
Looks like someone
beat her up.

39:16.826 --> 39:19.330
There's an old fire-escape
ladder

39:19.466 --> 39:21.495
on the north side
of the building.

39:21.631 --> 39:23.829
I could try to get down that,

39:23.965 --> 39:25.894
raise the alarm,
get some help in here.

39:26.030 --> 39:27.333
You have to go through 82.

39:27.468 --> 39:28.506
Ah, shit.

39:29.638 --> 39:30.935
That's unoccupied, right?

39:31.071 --> 39:33.038
Yeah. Like most of this
condemned dump.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.382
You got the tools?

39:37.518 --> 39:39.350
We could just cut right
through the door.

39:39.485 --> 39:41.276
In my truck.

39:41.412 --> 39:42.648
You ain't gettin' through
those old doors

39:42.784 --> 39:44.247
without something heavy-duty.

39:50.053 --> 39:52.094
I want Dad to come home.

39:55.396 --> 39:56.391
He will.

39:58.433 --> 40:00.433
When we get the phones working
again, he'll come right back.

40:00.569 --> 40:01.935
How do you know he will?

40:03.872 --> 40:05.838
You said Mom
was gonna be okay.

40:05.973 --> 40:07.902
I thought she would be.

40:08.038 --> 40:10.009
I'm so sorry, Kass.

40:14.052 --> 40:16.077
I'm gonna get my shotgun,
and we're gonna blast it open.

40:16.212 --> 40:17.753
Just give me a minute, okay?

40:18.786 --> 40:20.124
I don't like being trapped.

40:20.260 --> 40:21.458
Everyone is on edge enough

40:21.593 --> 40:23.286
without guns getting fired
in here.

41:01.833 --> 41:05.332
I don't know what to do, El.

41:05.467 --> 41:08.540
You're the one
who always has the answers.

41:12.702 --> 41:15.943
I'm too scared to even face
your kids right now.

41:27.286 --> 41:29.227
No matter how busy
you ever got,

41:29.363 --> 41:31.387
you always found time for me.

41:32.825 --> 41:34.126
For everyone.

41:38.432 --> 41:41.166
I can't believe I'm never
gonna speak to you again.

41:43.468 --> 41:46.501
<i>Hey, Bethy-boo. It's Ellie.</i>

41:46.637 --> 41:50.674
<i>Just... calling to say hi.</i>
<i>And, uh...</i>

41:50.809 --> 41:51.774
<i>Beth.</i>

41:51.909 --> 41:53.377
<i>Beth!</i>

41:53.512 --> 41:55.710
<i>You have to help me, Beth.</i>
<i>You have to.</i>

41:55.845 --> 41:58.386
<i>-I'm burning.</i>
<i>I'm burning alive!</i>

42:23.907 --> 42:24.913
El?

42:34.922 --> 42:36.628
-Mom?
-She's alive?

42:37.758 --> 42:39.092
She's burning up.

42:49.902 --> 42:50.999
I'll get ice.

44:03.611 --> 44:04.507
Mom?

44:06.117 --> 44:08.181
Mommy's with the maggots now.

45:08.172 --> 45:09.880
Mom, stop it!

45:15.555 --> 45:17.452
-Stop it!

45:22.259 --> 45:23.993
It's not my fault, Bridget.

45:26.533 --> 45:28.765
Get away from her, Bridge!

45:28.901 --> 45:31.434
What's happening to me,
sweetheart?

45:31.569 --> 45:32.628
I don't know, Mom.

45:35.406 --> 45:36.533
I do.

45:43.108 --> 45:44.277
I'm free now.

45:46.447 --> 45:49.084
Free from all you
titty-sucking parasites.

46:17.583 --> 46:18.711
Let me kiss it better.

46:44.934 --> 46:46.845
Who wants to rot next?

46:49.073 --> 46:50.277
Eeny...

46:52.351 --> 46:54.514
meeny...

46:54.650 --> 46:55.854
miny...

46:59.490 --> 47:00.353
You.

47:01.988 --> 47:03.559
Ellie?

47:21.347 --> 47:22.342
Fuck!

48:11.059 --> 48:12.421
Grab the cabinet.

48:19.529 --> 48:20.829
Get away from the door.

49:04.081 --> 49:05.306
Please, we need help!

49:05.441 --> 49:07.144
Let me in!

49:58.295 --> 49:59.532
Hello!

50:02.036 --> 50:04.141
Can you hear me?

50:15.084 --> 50:17.550
Don't you think Mom looks
just like one of those pictures
from that book?

50:21.485 --> 50:23.017
Answer me, Danny.

50:29.166 --> 50:31.096
You never should've stolen it.

50:31.232 --> 50:32.460
This isn't my fault.

50:32.596 --> 50:34.270
This is your fault!

50:34.405 --> 50:36.765
-Get off me! Get off!
Stop it!

50:36.901 --> 50:38.901
-Hey! Hey, hey!
-This is all your fault!

50:39.579 --> 50:40.672
Hey. Hey.

50:43.477 --> 50:45.281
You don't turn on each other.

50:47.850 --> 50:48.911
Ever.

50:50.517 --> 50:52.519
I need to show you something.

51:11.074 --> 51:12.473
What is this, Danny?

51:21.888 --> 51:23.154
Does it hurt bad?

51:26.416 --> 51:27.488
Bridget?

51:30.993 --> 51:32.196
I'm okay.

Hey there, cutie-pie.

54:19.098 --> 54:21.255
What's wrong with you, Mom?

54:23.436 --> 54:27.838
I was just feeling sad about
me and your dad.

54:27.973 --> 54:29.202
But he's here now.

54:29.338 --> 54:31.305
He came home to see us.

54:31.440 --> 54:33.135
We're getting back together.

54:34.772 --> 54:36.171
We love each other.

54:38.283 --> 54:39.977
Isn't that right, my darling?

54:47.917 --> 54:50.091
And we love you too.

55:19.148 --> 55:21.425
Open up and let us in, Kassie.

55:23.627 --> 55:26.188
We can be a big,
happy family again.

55:28.299 --> 55:30.258
You don't look so good, Mom.

55:32.068 --> 55:33.603
Oh.

55:33.739 --> 55:37.771
Nothing a big old hug and kiss
from you won't fix.

55:39.373 --> 55:40.675
Open up now,

55:41.376 --> 55:43.040
like a good girl.

55:50.780 --> 55:52.049
That's it.

55:53.223 --> 55:54.491
Come on, now.

55:57.387 --> 55:59.496
Do it for Mom and Dad.

56:13.672 --> 56:14.709
Mom!

56:30.120 --> 56:31.825
-You okay?
-I'm sorry.

56:33.430 --> 56:35.394
I thought Mom was better.

56:37.398 --> 56:39.069
Open the door
like you open your legs,

56:39.205 --> 56:40.603
you stinking groupie slut!

56:44.103 --> 56:48.512
I'm not a groupie,
you psycho bitch!

56:53.910 --> 56:54.914
Beth.

56:58.088 --> 56:59.083
Beth.

57:02.084 --> 57:03.494
Go to your room.

57:21.312 --> 57:22.942
It'll be okay, Danny.

57:27.113 --> 57:29.546
Staffanie will protect us.
Right?

57:36.687 --> 57:37.693
Yeah.

58:20.373 --> 58:22.232
What are you looking at, hon?

58:43.092 --> 58:44.789
I gotta
kill the creepy-crawlies

58:44.924 --> 58:46.927
that I got inside my tummy.

58:58.810 --> 59:01.579
I don't like having things
inside my tummy.

59:08.254 --> 59:10.053
Do you, Auntie Beth?

01:01:19.010 --> 01:01:20.014
Hey.

01:01:22.388 --> 01:01:23.644
Is this a nightmare?

01:01:26.451 --> 01:01:28.253
It's just like a nightmare,
Kass.

01:01:30.052 --> 01:01:33.760
Is what happened to Bridget
and Mom gonna happen to us?

01:01:33.896 --> 01:01:35.425
I'm not gonna let that happen.

01:01:36.532 --> 01:01:37.735
I promise.

01:01:40.906 --> 01:01:43.631
You'd be a good mom someday,
Auntie Beth.

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:47.803
Oh, yeah?

01:01:47.938 --> 01:01:48.944
Yeah.

01:01:50.714 --> 01:01:52.706
You know how to lie to kids.

01:02:21.009 --> 01:02:22.604
I thought I should tie her up.

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:25.882
Just in case.

01:02:29.886 --> 01:02:31.888
I wanna listen to that vinyl.

01:02:33.385 --> 01:02:35.925
It's too dangerous.
Those words...

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:38.695
Yeah, well, maybe
there's words on there

01:02:38.830 --> 01:02:41.656
that can help stop
all of this.

01:02:44.233 --> 01:02:46.364
We've got no power
to run a turntable.

01:02:48.769 --> 01:02:50.104
I can fix that.

01:03:10.793 --> 01:03:13.787
I listened to the first
and then he spoke the words
on the second.

01:03:17.729 --> 01:03:20.629
I guess I'll start
at the other end, then.

01:03:26.236 --> 01:03:27.537
Just in case.

01:03:58.339 --> 01:03:59.733
<i>It is now two nights</i>

01:03:59.868 --> 01:04:02.576
<i>since I read aloud</i>
<i>from the book.</i>

01:04:02.711 --> 01:04:05.542
<i>My want to understand and</i>
<i>commune with the other side</i>

01:04:05.677 --> 01:04:08.575
<i>could not have been</i>
<i>more misguided.</i>

01:04:08.710 --> 01:04:10.681
<i>I make this final recording</i>

01:04:10.817 --> 01:04:13.381
<i>as a warning to whoever next</i>
<i>comes into contact</i>

01:04:13.517 --> 01:04:15.156
<i>with its malignant pages.</i>

01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:20.691
Naturum Demonto
<i>cannot be destroyed.</i>

01:04:20.827 --> 01:04:25.027
<i>When you find it, bury it deep</i>
<i>in our secret vault,</i>

01:04:25.162 --> 01:04:28.562
<i>for the words I uttered have</i>
<i>unleashed a demonic entity</i>

01:04:28.697 --> 01:04:30.435
<i>beyond my darkest nightmare.</i>

01:04:33.068 --> 01:04:35.605
Is Bridget gonna
come back like Mom?

01:04:38.848 --> 01:04:40.412
I don't know, Kass.

01:04:43.353 --> 01:04:46.055
<i> The demon possessed</i>
<i>Cortez first,</i>

01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:47.925
<i>rotting him</i>
<i>from the inside out.</i>

01:04:55.365 --> 01:04:56.791
<i>With the might of</i>
<i>our Lord's words,</i>

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:59.295
<i>we tried to drive out</i>
<i>the foul entity</i>

01:04:59.431 --> 01:05:01.268
<i>but it mocked our prayers</i>

01:05:01.404 --> 01:05:03.435
<i>and took Shanahan</i>
<i>under its control.</i>

01:05:06.241 --> 01:05:08.937
<i>Fellow priests</i>
<i>came to our aid</i>

01:05:09.073 --> 01:05:10.746
<i>but the possession quickly</i>
<i>spread amongst them</i>

01:05:10.882 --> 01:05:12.774
<i>without rhyme nor reason.</i>

01:05:26.926 --> 01:05:30.799
<i>This evil is not governed</i>
<i>by the rules of man.</i>

01:05:30.935 --> 01:05:33.433
<i>No, it takes its pleasure</i>

01:05:33.568 --> 01:05:36.798
<i>in creating terror</i>
<i>through total chaos.</i>

01:05:42.441 --> 01:05:44.840
<i>Desperate to end this curse,</i>

01:05:44.975 --> 01:05:48.614
<i>I tried to kill what were once</i>
<i>my brothers.</i>

01:05:48.749 --> 01:05:51.516
<i>I led them to the woodshed</i>
<i>and set it ablaze.</i>

01:05:52.616 --> 01:05:54.548
<i>But they danced in its flame</i>

01:05:54.683 --> 01:05:56.856
<i>and reveled in its burn.</i>

01:06:22.253 --> 01:06:25.055
Mr. Fonda's kitty hides up
there sometimes.

01:06:26.957 --> 01:06:29.954
I don't think it's a cat.

01:06:30.089 --> 01:06:32.519
<i> I buried their</i>
<i>squirming, spitting corpses</i>

01:06:32.655 --> 01:06:33.860
<i>in consecrated earth.</i>

01:06:35.966 --> 01:06:37.866
<i>But they arose again,</i>

01:06:38.001 --> 01:06:39.729
<i>rotting and rage-filled.</i>

01:06:47.538 --> 01:06:49.706
-Careful, Danny.

01:07:34.988 --> 01:07:37.556
<i> After hiding</i>
<i>in the cellar for a night,</i>

01:07:37.691 --> 01:07:39.756
<i>I knew only</i>
<i>one choice remained.</i>

01:07:41.361 --> 01:07:44.101
<i>Complete bodily dismemberment.</i>

01:08:04.449 --> 01:08:07.014
Told you, you should've
put the book back, Danny.

01:08:23.367 --> 01:08:27.276
<i>I chopped, and I hacked,</i>
<i>and I...</i>

01:08:29.572 --> 01:08:30.646
<i>I failed.</i>

01:08:33.884 --> 01:08:38.146
<i>I can hear them</i>
<i>outside the doors now,</i>
<i>begging for me.</i>

01:08:38.282 --> 01:08:42.423
<i>It is only a matter of time</i>
<i>before I am taken too.</i>

01:08:42.559 --> 01:08:46.329
<i>Nothing can stop</i>
<i>this demonic force.</i>

01:08:46.464 --> 01:08:49.199
<i>Even its final remnants</i>
<i>will come after you.</i>

01:08:50.428 --> 01:08:51.834
<i>You must run.</i>

01:08:51.969 --> 01:08:54.204
<i>All you can do is run!</i>

01:09:04.514 --> 01:09:06.543
<i>This horror will not stop</i>

01:09:06.678 --> 01:09:08.713
<i>until innocence is destroyed.</i>

01:09:10.151 --> 01:09:11.715
<i>Until evil...</i>

01:09:11.850 --> 01:09:13.852
<i>...be thy name.</i>

01:09:35.175 --> 01:09:36.004
Danny.

01:09:40.378 --> 01:09:42.542
I'm sorry, Kass.

01:09:50.594 --> 01:09:53.263
I will swallow your soul.

01:10:13.444 --> 01:10:14.911
Two souls?

01:10:20.287 --> 01:10:22.020
Please. El...

01:10:22.155 --> 01:10:25.924
Ellie waits in hell for you
and your unborn bastard baby.

01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:27.055
No.

01:10:33.829 --> 01:10:34.931
Auntie Beth!

01:10:57.225 --> 01:10:58.361
Are you hurt?

01:11:02.968 --> 01:11:04.631
Are you gonna be a mom?

01:11:13.305 --> 01:11:14.311
Yes.

01:11:17.843 --> 01:11:19.712
And I'm getting us
out of here.

01:11:21.016 --> 01:11:22.110
How?

01:11:55.484 --> 01:11:56.809
Fire escape. Let's go.

01:12:05.624 --> 01:12:08.057
Don't look back there.

01:13:14.628 --> 01:13:16.466
Get back. Cover your ears.

01:13:21.402 --> 01:13:22.399
Bethy-boo!

01:13:39.283 --> 01:13:40.455
She's trying to take

01:13:40.590 --> 01:13:42.316
your mommy away
from you, Kassie.

01:13:44.395 --> 01:13:46.419
I know you're not my mom
anymore.

01:13:52.698 --> 01:13:54.130
Don't take me from them.

01:13:55.967 --> 01:13:57.497
You have no idea
what it's like

01:13:57.633 --> 01:14:00.004
to bring a child into
this world, Beth.

01:14:05.510 --> 01:14:08.848
That's my gun,
you thieving cunt.

01:14:15.457 --> 01:14:16.317
Auntie Beth!

01:14:17.127 --> 01:14:18.352
Auntie Beth!

01:14:40.413 --> 01:14:43.619
Everybody here
dies by dawn, Beth.

01:14:44.450 --> 01:14:46.389
Run!

01:14:46.525 --> 01:14:47.887
Dead by dawn!

01:14:49.017 --> 01:14:50.989
Dead by dawn!

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:53.695
-Dead by dawn!
-By dawn!

01:14:54.991 --> 01:14:56.863
Dead by dawn!

01:14:57.927 --> 01:14:59.727
Dead by dawn!

01:14:59.863 --> 01:15:02.103
Dead by dawn!

01:15:02.239 --> 01:15:03.335
Dead by dawn!

01:15:05.143 --> 01:15:07.038
Dead by dawn!

01:15:08.036 --> 01:15:09.205
Dead by dawn!

01:15:10.577 --> 01:15:12.549
Dead by dawn!

01:15:17.153 --> 01:15:18.219
Here.

01:16:27.217 --> 01:16:29.751
No way out!

01:16:29.886 --> 01:16:32.490
No way out!

01:16:32.625 --> 01:16:34.730
No way out!

01:16:45.202 --> 01:16:46.643
-Auntie Beth!
-Come here!

01:17:00.083 --> 01:17:01.618
-No!

01:18:00.383 --> 01:18:02.345
Kassie. Kassie.

01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:08.087
Kassie. Kassie. Kassie.

01:18:13.561 --> 01:18:14.555
Am I dead?

01:18:35.143 --> 01:18:36.412
Come on. Get in.

01:18:59.841 --> 01:19:01.107
Kass, where's the beeper?

01:19:10.454 --> 01:19:11.645
Come on. Come on.

01:19:32.574 --> 01:19:33.502
It's coming.

01:21:28.382 --> 01:21:29.222
Get under!

01:21:39.931 --> 01:21:41.333
Kassie!

01:22:17.298 --> 01:22:20.267
All I want
is your little head, baby girl.

01:22:41.566 --> 01:22:43.032
Come get some.

01:24:08.114 --> 01:24:09.948
Turn it on, Kass!

01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:04.800
Please.

01:25:06.041 --> 01:25:07.605
Help me, Bethy-boo.

01:25:09.741 --> 01:25:13.642
Only my sister
gets to call me that.

01:25:47.811 --> 01:25:50.010
You know, you really do
look like Mom.

01:25:52.620 --> 01:25:56.253
And you're gonna fail
miserably just like her.

01:25:56.389 --> 01:25:57.822
You stinking, horrible...

01:25:57.957 --> 01:26:00.229
...groupie cunt!

01:28:32.010 --> 01:28:33.213
There's been no cell signal

01:28:33.349 --> 01:28:34.478
until, like, five minutes ago

01:28:34.614 --> 01:28:35.978
and the thunder kept me awake,

01:28:36.113 --> 01:28:38.519
so I got basically
less than zero sleep.

01:28:38.654 --> 01:28:41.216
Anyway, all my early morning
moans aside,

01:28:41.352 --> 01:28:44.787
we are still gonna have such
a fab weekend at the lake.

01:28:44.922 --> 01:28:46.693
Caleb's dad's cabin
is so awesome,

01:28:46.828 --> 01:28:49.123
and you're gonna absolutely
love his friends.

01:28:51.194 --> 01:28:53.327
I'm sure one of them
will be perfect for you.

01:28:53.463 --> 01:28:55.395
<i> I don't mean to be</i>
<i>a downer or anything</i>

01:28:55.531 --> 01:28:57.699
<i>but I was actually thinking</i>
<i>of taking a rain check</i>

01:28:57.835 --> 01:29:00.039
<i>on this whole trip thing.</i>

01:29:00.175 --> 01:29:01.042
Not a chance.

01:29:01.178 --> 01:29:02.644
I'm picking you up in 15.

01:29:02.780 --> 01:29:03.742
Bye!
