00:12.666 --> 00:15.666
-[horns beeping]
-[siren blaring]

00:22.000 --> 00:25.541
Don't be filming this for one of those
causal introductory shots, please.

00:25.625 --> 00:26.833
This shit's demeaning.

00:27.666 --> 00:30.875
So, what is it you guys wanna talk about?
What's this for?

00:30.958 --> 00:34.875
[director] It's a look back over the year.
We're reliving the events of 2020.

00:36.083 --> 00:38.083
Why in the fuck would you wanna do that?

00:39.166 --> 00:42.833
[narrator] 2020, a year so momentous
they named it twice.

00:42.916 --> 00:47.791
A year whose story couldn't be told
until now because it was still happening.

00:48.458 --> 00:50.958
With unprecedented access to experts…

00:51.041 --> 00:54.250
If I keep my little assistant down here,
that's alright? Good.

00:54.333 --> 00:55.500
Politicos…

00:55.583 --> 00:57.500
You know you look ridiculous, right?

00:57.583 --> 00:58.833
Powerbrokers…

00:58.916 --> 01:01.791
-[director] We are ready now.
-Just a second.

01:01.875 --> 01:04.083
-Monarchs…
-Mind the chandelier.

01:04.166 --> 01:05.875
[chandelier crashes down]

01:05.958 --> 01:06.958
Christ.

01:07.041 --> 01:08.791
-Scientists…
-Wait, wait, wait.

01:08.875 --> 01:10.833
Let me just ingest some H20.

01:11.750 --> 01:14.041
-Psychologists…
-I'm gonna smoke.

01:14.125 --> 01:15.791
Y'all got on masks, so what do you care?

01:16.416 --> 01:18.458
And average citizens…

01:18.541 --> 01:20.500
So, will this be on Quibi?

01:20.583 --> 01:24.875
This is the definitive story
of the most historic year in history

01:24.958 --> 01:27.750
through the eyes and minds
of those who lived it.

01:27.833 --> 01:31.000
This… is 2020.

01:32.250 --> 01:33.958
I mean really, why?

01:34.458 --> 01:37.541
[dramatic drumming]

01:38.708 --> 01:42.958
[dramatic music playing]

01:53.583 --> 01:57.166
[dramatic music crescendos]

02:04.583 --> 02:08.166
[narrator] It's January 1st,
and on the day it is born

02:08.250 --> 02:11.083
2020 seems like any other year.

02:12.250 --> 02:15.125
Well, January started out as usual.

02:15.208 --> 02:18.916
The planet was floating in space
like it normally does.

02:19.000 --> 02:23.250
But as it began to revolve
and loom closer,

02:23.333 --> 02:26.583
you could see there was
this immense natural disaster

02:26.666 --> 02:28.458
happening on its backside.

02:29.041 --> 02:34.083
[narrator] Fire, a radicalized, angry form
of air and one of mankind's oldest foes,

02:34.166 --> 02:35.416
is raging out of control,

02:35.500 --> 02:39.875
subjecting the Australian landscape
to an extreme carbon makeover.

02:39.958 --> 02:41.791
The scenes were appalling.

02:41.875 --> 02:46.083
I mean it left these areas utterly
inhospitable, even to Australians.

02:47.166 --> 02:51.458
[narrator] While Australia burns,
in the snowy hell that is Switzerland,

02:51.541 --> 02:54.500
an assortment of the world's
most powerful people and bastards

02:54.583 --> 02:56.541
arrive at the Davos summit.

02:56.625 --> 02:59.000
Davos is basically Coachella
for billionaires.

02:59.083 --> 03:04.000
And this year, pretending to care about
climate change was top of the agenda,

03:04.083 --> 03:06.875
so they had Greta Thunberg headlining.

03:06.958 --> 03:09.333
She's this teenage girl
who's become famous

03:09.416 --> 03:11.666
even though everything she says
is depressing.

03:11.750 --> 03:13.416
Kind of like Billie Eilish.

03:14.000 --> 03:17.041
Our house is still on fire.

03:18.208 --> 03:22.333
Your inaction is fueling the flames
by the hour.

03:22.833 --> 03:25.000
[narrator]
While the junior harbinger speaks,

03:25.083 --> 03:29.625
amongst her audience of powerbrokers
is billionaire tech mogul Bark Multiverse.

03:29.708 --> 03:31.958
We are telling you to act

03:32.041 --> 03:35.750
as if you loved your children
above all else.

03:35.833 --> 03:36.833
Thank you.

03:37.500 --> 03:38.875
[Bark Multiverse] It was powerful.

03:39.458 --> 03:41.666
Usually when a child is shouting for help,

03:41.750 --> 03:44.125
it's best to ignore them
in case it's a trap.

03:44.208 --> 03:46.958
No less a man than Jeffrey Epstein
told me that.

03:47.458 --> 03:50.416
But this little lady's words hit home.

03:51.083 --> 03:55.083
I realized our whole world could collapse
into chaos and disaster,

03:55.166 --> 03:58.375
and here's me,
one of the richest people on the planet,

03:58.458 --> 04:01.750
in a position
to actually do something about it.

04:02.333 --> 04:03.916
As soon as she finished speaking,

04:04.000 --> 04:06.583
I hit the phone, got my people
to buy a mountain in New Zealand,

04:06.666 --> 04:09.125
had it hollowed out, and here we are.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.125
In my survival bunker.

04:12.333 --> 04:15.875
-[director] Don't people call you selfish?
-I don't know. It's soundproof.

04:17.000 --> 04:21.333
[narrator] Meanwhile in America, President
and experimental pig-man Donald Trump

04:21.416 --> 04:25.916
faces the 407th most historic crisis
of his presidency.

04:26.000 --> 04:28.541
The US President,
you may have heard of him,

04:28.625 --> 04:30.916
he's quite the character, Mr. Trump,

04:31.000 --> 04:35.750
was facing an impeachment trial,
which is a traditional ceremony

04:35.833 --> 04:39.666
that Americans perform to work out
whether their president has gone off.

04:40.333 --> 04:43.833
Trump was in trouble.
What he needed was a distraction,

04:43.916 --> 04:47.000
either something big like a goose
flying in through the window,

04:47.083 --> 04:49.708
or something small like World War Three.

04:49.791 --> 04:54.583
Luckily, our military had located
this Iranian general, Soleimani,

04:54.666 --> 04:56.375
real military superstar,

04:56.458 --> 04:59.125
the Beyoncé
of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard.

04:59.708 --> 05:03.625
[male reporter] The aftermath shows an
attack that was deliberate and sustained.

05:03.708 --> 05:06.666
[Bracket] So, then Trump walks out
to announce the hit.

05:06.750 --> 05:09.750
And for fun, he does it
in the style of a children's poet

05:09.833 --> 05:11.291
recovering from a brain trauma.

05:11.875 --> 05:15.250
He's been called a monster,
and he was a monster.

05:15.333 --> 05:18.208
And he's no longer a monster, he's dead.

05:18.291 --> 05:21.708
Well, of course, the Iranians would
have preferred their chap, on the whole,

05:21.791 --> 05:23.583
not to explode.

05:23.666 --> 05:26.583
[chanting in Persian]

05:26.666 --> 05:29.375
This almost started World War Three.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.708
And it's only fucking January.

05:31.791 --> 05:32.791
[Big Ben chimes]

05:32.875 --> 05:37.916
[narrator] In the UK, everyday citizens
celebrate the countdown to Brexit-cide

05:38.000 --> 05:39.500
and the recent installation

05:39.583 --> 05:43.791
of newly-elected Prime Ministerial
scarecrow, Boris Johnson.

05:45.041 --> 05:47.791
But others have little to celebrate.

05:48.583 --> 05:50.958
[imitating Queen's accent]
My name is Her Royal Highness,

05:51.041 --> 05:53.041
Queen Elizabeth The First part two.

05:53.958 --> 05:58.666
For the purposes of this recording,
you may address me as "Your Majesty."

05:59.666 --> 06:03.625
[director] So, can you remember where
you were when you first heard the news…

06:07.000 --> 06:08.083
Your Majesty?

06:08.750 --> 06:11.791
Here in Buckingham Palace,

06:11.875 --> 06:14.125
posing for a banknote portrait.

06:14.208 --> 06:16.333
It was proving tedious,

06:16.416 --> 06:20.500
so I turned to my portable telephone
machine for some light relief.

06:21.333 --> 06:25.916
And there on Meghan's Instagram
was the announcement.

06:27.583 --> 06:30.791
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex
have announced that they are carving out

06:30.875 --> 06:33.416
what they call
"a new role" for themselves.

06:33.500 --> 06:35.625
In a statement released
in the last few minutes,

06:35.708 --> 06:40.416
they say they intend to step back
as senior members of the Royal Family.

06:41.041 --> 06:43.083
[director] That must have come
as quite a shock.

06:43.166 --> 06:44.375
Well, of course.

06:45.125 --> 06:48.500
And I think that's reflected
in the banknote portrait.

06:48.583 --> 06:52.750
Sadly, I believe they felt there is
a degree of prejudice in Britain.

06:53.250 --> 06:55.416
Which is why they moved to America,

06:55.500 --> 06:58.083
where race has never been an issue at all.

06:58.666 --> 07:02.500
[narrator] But the year is about to be
dominated by an infinitely bigger story

07:02.583 --> 07:04.958
emerging on the other side of the world.

07:05.041 --> 07:09.208
Residents in Wuhan, China,
are succumbing to a mysterious illness,

07:09.291 --> 07:13.666
which at first baffles doctors,
then doubles down by killing them.

07:13.750 --> 07:18.750
Scientists in the West can only watch
from afar or on television,

07:18.833 --> 07:20.416
both of which are safer.

07:21.708 --> 07:26.208
I have studied viruses for 15 years
and consider many of them close friends.

07:26.291 --> 07:28.750
But I have to say,
this was the most recent.

07:28.833 --> 07:31.875
The virus itself is
an interesting specimen.

07:31.958 --> 07:33.333
On close inspection,

07:33.416 --> 07:39.000
it resembles a revolving alien basketball
rendered on a PlayStation 2.

07:39.583 --> 07:41.708
Which is biologically unusual.

07:42.708 --> 07:46.500
As to where it came from,
there is a theory it originated in bats,

07:46.583 --> 07:50.875
although how it passed to humans
isn't clear and the bats aren't talking.

07:50.958 --> 07:54.541
Except in ultrasonic tones
we cannot detect.

07:55.291 --> 07:58.625
The hypothesis is a man
had intercourse with a bat

07:58.708 --> 08:02.666
and got bat juice in his pee-pee hole,
which festered and took hold.

08:03.500 --> 08:06.208
We have tried replicating this
in the laboratory

08:06.291 --> 08:08.416
but with limited success because…

08:09.375 --> 08:11.041
the bat keeps flying away.

08:12.583 --> 08:14.000
[narrator] As the outbreak worsens,

08:14.083 --> 08:17.041
Chinese authorities quickly swing
into cover-up.

08:17.125 --> 08:20.750
Some doctors caught the virus early on
and tried to raise the alarm.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.375
But blowing the whistle
while you're on a ventilator?

08:23.458 --> 08:25.041
Ah… that's a big ask.

08:25.625 --> 08:28.083
[narrator] Meanwhile,
the virus has seeped out of China,

08:28.166 --> 08:31.208
turning surrounding areas of the map
the color of disease

08:31.291 --> 08:33.500
and ruining a perfectly good atlas.

08:33.583 --> 08:37.125
A full-scale medical emergency
is underway.

08:37.208 --> 08:38.875
Nonetheless, in the West,

08:38.958 --> 08:41.958
the average citizen
is largely unconcerned.

08:42.500 --> 08:45.333
Yeah, I can't say I was fussed
about any of that.

08:45.416 --> 08:46.875
Was that this year?

08:47.541 --> 08:49.458
[director] The pandemic? Yeah.

08:49.541 --> 08:53.416
-How come you're talking to me about this?
-[director] You provide human color.

08:53.500 --> 08:56.750
Alright, even I know that's racist
and I've not done an awareness course.

08:56.833 --> 08:59.458
[director] No, you're an average person.
We ran a computer search,

08:59.541 --> 09:02.500
and you're one of the five
most average people in the world.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.000
Oh.

09:04.916 --> 09:05.916
Thanks.

09:06.750 --> 09:10.041
[narrator] With the pandemic
firmly at the back of Western minds,

09:10.125 --> 09:13.458
the front of Western minds is free
to focus on important matters

09:13.541 --> 09:18.333
like the Oscars, which traditionally
celebrates Caucasian filmmakers.

09:18.416 --> 09:21.625
This year promises to be different,
but isn't.

09:21.708 --> 09:25.833
Yeah, those Best Picture nominees,
real rainbow coalition.

09:25.916 --> 09:30.291
You got Marriage Story, two mopey white
people trapped in an affluent marriage.

09:30.875 --> 09:33.541
Ford v Ferrari,
that's white guys on wheels.

09:33.625 --> 09:37.583
Little Women, four white girls
standing on the cusp of Karenhood.

09:37.666 --> 09:40.416
And Joker, whose lead actor
performs in whiteface,

09:40.500 --> 09:43.000
thereby appropriating
his own cultural identity

09:43.083 --> 09:46.208
while denying a role to a genuine clown.

09:46.791 --> 09:49.875
Oh, and 1917, which was the year
the movie was set,

09:49.958 --> 09:52.083
and the number of white people in it.

09:52.166 --> 09:55.833
[narrator] Oscar night, disaster strikes
for the 10,000 white hopefuls,

09:55.916 --> 09:58.666
as a South Korean entry
makes movie history.

09:59.291 --> 10:01.375
And the Oscar goes to…

10:04.375 --> 10:05.833
Parasite.

10:05.916 --> 10:07.541
[cheers and applause]

10:08.875 --> 10:10.208
Parasite?

10:10.291 --> 10:12.250
That's not even an English word.

10:12.333 --> 10:13.666
[director] Actually, it is.

10:13.750 --> 10:14.750
What?

10:14.833 --> 10:16.500
[director] Parasite is an English word.

10:19.125 --> 10:21.041
Only when you say it in English.

10:23.791 --> 10:27.000
[narrator] Away from tinsel town,
Washington DC has been consumed

10:27.083 --> 10:30.041
by real drama, Trump's impeachment trial.

10:30.125 --> 10:33.166
The President stands accused
of pressuring a foreign power

10:33.250 --> 10:37.375
into investigating Hunter Biden,
son of prehistoric concierge Joe Biden,

10:37.458 --> 10:40.750
who has a chance of challenging Trump
in the November elections.

10:40.833 --> 10:43.500
But not everyone believes
the charges have merit.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.958
The whole impeachment thing
was baseless, OK?

10:47.041 --> 10:50.958
So, the Democrats claim
that Trump pressured Ukraine

10:51.041 --> 10:53.541
into digging up dirt on the Biden family,

10:53.625 --> 10:57.916
and their only real "evidence" of that
is a transcript of him doing it.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.833
-[dir.] What did he say on the transcript?
-What transcript?

11:02.833 --> 11:04.875
[director] You just mentioned
a transcript.

11:05.916 --> 11:07.833
Check your tape, I said no such thing.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.083
[director] You said, uh…
the only real evidence was

11:11.166 --> 11:13.000
a transcript of Trump pressuring Ukraine…

11:13.083 --> 11:14.833
There's no such place as Ukraine.

11:16.458 --> 11:18.125
[director] Yes, there… Yes, there is.

11:18.208 --> 11:20.166
I choose to believe there is not.

11:22.291 --> 11:25.708
[narrator] The Republican-controlled
Senate votes along partisan lines.

11:25.791 --> 11:29.166
Trump is declared not guilty and fabulous.

11:29.750 --> 11:31.833
But this is what the end result is.

11:31.916 --> 11:35.125
[loud applause and cheers]

11:35.208 --> 11:38.583
[narrator] While Republicans cheer
the President for holding a newspaper,

11:38.666 --> 11:40.416
in another political universe

11:40.500 --> 11:43.958
the Democrats are deciding
who will take on Trump in November.

11:44.041 --> 11:48.291
The race has narrowed to a face-off
between Civil War hero Joe Biden

11:48.375 --> 11:50.958
and anarchist grandpa Bernie Sanders.

11:51.041 --> 11:53.750
As you may have noticed lately,

11:54.583 --> 11:57.916
the establishment's getting
a little bit nervous.

11:58.958 --> 12:01.458
Well, as Super Tuesday arrives,

12:01.541 --> 12:04.125
despite his huge early gains,

12:04.208 --> 12:06.625
Mr. Sanders's support was shriveling,

12:07.208 --> 12:10.750
whereas Biden appeared
to have come back from the dead.

12:10.833 --> 12:13.750
I mean, literally,
he resembled a butler's ghost.

12:13.833 --> 12:15.791
[shouting] We are very much alive!

12:15.875 --> 12:17.458
[loud cheers]

12:17.541 --> 12:20.500
[Bracket] This was a choice
between two guys in their late seventies.

12:20.583 --> 12:25.291
It was like being stuck on the character
selection screen in geriatric Tekken.

12:25.375 --> 12:27.291
Bernie offered radical change,

12:27.375 --> 12:30.750
whereas Biden reminded folks
of a more easygoing era

12:30.833 --> 12:33.958
when you could sniff a woman's hair
without being called creepy.

12:34.791 --> 12:38.458
I think to many Americans,
Biden is Uncle Joe.

12:38.541 --> 12:40.791
He's been a part of their lives
for centuries.

12:40.875 --> 12:44.250
As familiar as an old armchair
and nearly as sharp-witted.

12:44.916 --> 12:46.833
We're gonna do this, folks!

12:46.916 --> 12:49.916
[narrator] Amiable phantom Joe Biden
seizes victory,

12:50.000 --> 12:52.625
officially starting
the 2020 election campaign.

12:52.708 --> 12:53.791
Yeah!

12:53.875 --> 12:57.166
[narrator] The stage is set
for an electoral showdown

12:57.250 --> 12:59.125
between two very different Americas.

12:59.208 --> 13:01.500
-[man shouting] Fuck you!
-I don't smoke.

13:01.583 --> 13:04.750
Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

13:04.833 --> 13:08.208
[narrator] And the animus between
the two sides is greater than ever.

13:08.875 --> 13:13.125
Polarization is the problem of our age.

13:13.208 --> 13:16.250
And not just in America,
in the actual world too.

13:16.333 --> 13:21.750
Whether the debate is over Trump or Brexit
or science or gender, God help us,

13:21.833 --> 13:24.250
or reality itself,

13:24.333 --> 13:26.625
no two factions can agree,

13:26.708 --> 13:28.250
or agree to disagree,

13:28.333 --> 13:32.250
or even agree that their disagreement
might be disagreeable.

13:32.333 --> 13:35.833
-[director] I'm not sure I totally agree.
-Well, then why don't you fuck off?

13:38.000 --> 13:41.958
-[lighthearted, cheerful music playing]
-[birds chirping]

13:42.041 --> 13:45.416
[woman 1] I would say that I'm just
a regular soccer mom, you know?

13:45.500 --> 13:47.750
I've got the husband and the kids,

13:47.833 --> 13:52.208
and a cat and a dog,
and just the whole darn show.

13:52.708 --> 13:56.375
[chuckles] Uh, no, I wouldn't describe
myself as a big internet person, no.

13:56.458 --> 13:58.958
I mean, I only use Facebook and WhatsApp.

13:59.041 --> 14:00.333
[chuckles]

14:00.416 --> 14:02.708
And Instagram and Twitter and YouTube.

14:02.791 --> 14:05.125
Oh, and Google.

14:05.208 --> 14:08.833
In fact, that's how I discovered
the Ivory Fist message board.

14:10.333 --> 14:13.250
[woman 2] Look,
things wasn't always this way.

14:13.333 --> 14:17.041
I've studied human behavior
long enough to get sick of it.

14:17.541 --> 14:21.208
You gotta remember, most folks
are still neighborly, Ned Flanders.

14:21.291 --> 14:22.666
Unfuckably nice.

14:22.750 --> 14:25.666
But right now,
the edges are rougher than ever.

14:25.750 --> 14:31.083
On the right, you got shit-nose extremists
wondering aloud whether Hitler was all bad

14:31.166 --> 14:33.541
and inventing
their own clown house reality.

14:33.625 --> 14:38.000
And on the left,
you got fucking whiney woke-lords

14:38.083 --> 14:39.791
cancelling the shit out of anyone

14:39.875 --> 14:42.833
who dares to take a dump
at the wrong time of the day.

14:42.916 --> 14:44.708
And both sides,

14:44.791 --> 14:48.416
both sides look so unhappy
it makes you wanna puke.

14:49.416 --> 14:52.916
But the way it's going, you know we
gonna end up on one side or the other.

14:53.000 --> 14:55.958
So, pick your fucking team
and hunker the fuck down.

14:56.458 --> 15:00.208
[narrator] Throughout 2020,
the gods of Silicon Valley stand accused

15:00.291 --> 15:04.750
of allowing their products to split
the world into two warring factions.

15:04.833 --> 15:08.083
Uh… actually, it's more like
four warring factions.

15:08.750 --> 15:12.500
We prefer to call it a hate spectrum.
That's the official term.

15:13.000 --> 15:15.833
[director] Right now, it takes about
six months' exposure to social media

15:15.916 --> 15:18.416
for the average person
to become hopelessly radicalized.

15:18.500 --> 15:21.250
I know, right. We're hoping
to get that down to five minutes.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.000
Mmm.

15:23.083 --> 15:25.833
Now, of course, all this division,

15:25.916 --> 15:28.250
all this intractable conflict,

15:28.333 --> 15:32.541
was tearing humankind asunder
at the worst possible time.

15:32.625 --> 15:34.916
Because, of course, at the very moment

15:35.000 --> 15:37.291
that we were preoccupied
with fighting each other,

15:37.375 --> 15:40.750
the coronavirus was steadily
bearing down upon us.

15:41.916 --> 15:45.416
Now, those who've closely studied
the history books,

15:45.500 --> 15:47.208
such as myself,

15:47.291 --> 15:50.625
knew that this was strongly reminiscent
of the time the White Walkers

15:50.708 --> 15:54.791
led their "army of the dead"
towards the warring factions of Westeros.

15:54.875 --> 15:57.333
[director] So, you mean
like in Game of Thrones?

15:57.416 --> 16:00.291
No, no. I am discussing history.

16:00.375 --> 16:03.166
I'm pretty sure that was Game of Thrones.

16:03.250 --> 16:06.250
Well, I'm pretty sure
that I am the historian here.

16:07.708 --> 16:09.375
Cut to a map or something.

16:09.958 --> 16:11.875
[narrator] As this map we've cut to
makes clear,

16:11.958 --> 16:14.833
the coronavirus is indeed spreading
at an alarming pace.

16:14.916 --> 16:19.875
Yet even as it inches towards them,
millions persist in everyday activities.

16:21.000 --> 16:22.208
[Dr. Gravel] We saw the news.

16:22.291 --> 16:25.416
They made it clear that the virus
was coming and it was gonna be bad.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.166
But a lot of us didn't wanna know.

16:27.250 --> 16:29.208
[director] And why do you think that is?

16:29.291 --> 16:31.875
I don't know, denial, disbelief.

16:31.958 --> 16:36.500
Or because, in my professional opinion,
we're fucking imbeciles.

16:37.375 --> 16:39.625
That's the title of my next book
by the way.

16:39.708 --> 16:41.500
[narrator] In a desperate bid
for attention,

16:41.583 --> 16:44.041
the virus infects
beloved Hollywood everyman

16:44.125 --> 16:47.583
and occasional CGI Cowboy, Tom Hanks,

16:47.666 --> 16:51.083
providing news networks
with an irresistible celebrity angle

16:51.166 --> 16:53.833
to the otherwise boring deadly pandemic.

16:53.916 --> 16:57.291
[female reporter] We think of Tom Hanks
as a positive kind of guy,

16:57.375 --> 16:59.583
not a guy who tests positive.

16:59.666 --> 17:02.958
He was battling the virus
for two whole weeks.

17:03.541 --> 17:06.833
Ah, being a leading man,
he won in the end, of course.

17:06.916 --> 17:09.708
I rather doubt that he'd have accepted
the role if he hadn't.

17:10.583 --> 17:14.458
[Pyrex Flask] It showed the virus
could also pass from humans to icons,

17:14.541 --> 17:18.333
which raised the possibility
that it might one day infect God.

17:18.416 --> 17:21.083
And God is older than the universe,

17:21.166 --> 17:23.833
which puts him in a high-risk category.

17:24.333 --> 17:26.791
[narrator] Fear rocks Wall Street

17:26.875 --> 17:31.125
with the stock market shitting ten billion
coins out of its economic anus.

17:31.708 --> 17:35.250
[shouting] On the bell, on the bell!
FIS on the bell!

17:35.333 --> 17:39.291
[narrator] As cold reality sets in,
there's a run on the supermarkets.

17:39.375 --> 17:41.791
Around the world,
panic-buyers empty shelves

17:41.875 --> 17:44.375
faster than panic-stockers
can refill them.

17:44.458 --> 17:46.041
It is a full-blown crisis.

17:46.958 --> 17:49.583
Government buildings
wonder how to respond.

17:51.125 --> 17:54.208
With cases surging,
Italy introduces a lockdown.

17:54.291 --> 17:56.958
Other European governments
contemplate following suit.

17:57.041 --> 17:59.500
And yet, around the same time in London,

17:59.583 --> 18:01.958
Prime Minister and haystack Boris Johnson

18:02.041 --> 18:05.416
decides that since Britain
is no longer part of Europe,

18:05.500 --> 18:07.375
it can safely ignore the warnings.

18:07.458 --> 18:09.708
He encourages those
who haven't already died

18:09.791 --> 18:14.208
to go about their business as usual,
but with a greater emphasis on hygiene.

18:14.791 --> 18:17.916
The single most useful thing
that we can all do

18:18.000 --> 18:22.208
to stop the spread of coronavirus
is to wash our hands.

18:22.291 --> 18:25.250
[Nerrick] That was weird.
One minute he was doing a soap ad about

18:25.333 --> 18:27.791
how important it was
to keep your hands clean

18:27.875 --> 18:31.583
and the next he was boasting about
how he didn't care what he did with them.

18:31.666 --> 18:33.333
I was at a hospital the other night

18:33.416 --> 18:36.583
where I think there were actually
a few coronavirus patients,

18:36.666 --> 18:38.333
and I shook hands with everybody.

18:38.416 --> 18:40.541
Totally put me off using hands whatsoever.

18:40.625 --> 18:44.500
So, I started doing absolutely everything
with my elbows instead.

18:45.541 --> 18:48.333
And it was shortly after that
my boyfriend left.

18:49.250 --> 18:51.125
[sirens wailing]

18:51.208 --> 18:53.708
[narrator] America also seems
underprepared.

18:53.791 --> 18:56.625
New York is hit hard.

18:56.708 --> 18:58.166
At a series of daily briefings,

18:58.250 --> 19:01.208
Governor Andrew Cuomo desperately pleads
for medical supplies.

19:01.291 --> 19:03.625
Where are the ventilators?

19:03.708 --> 19:08.000
Where are the gowns, where's the PPEs,
where are the masks, where are they?

19:08.791 --> 19:12.375
[narrator] Sadly, he has failed to notice
they are piled up behind him.

19:13.083 --> 19:17.208
Across the USA, supplies of masks,
which, unlike guns,

19:17.291 --> 19:20.083
cannot be cheaply
and easily manufactured, run low,

19:20.166 --> 19:23.625
while critics describe
the lack of ventilators as "breathtaking."

19:23.708 --> 19:27.916
It felt like the government
wasn't taking the coronavirus seriously.

19:28.000 --> 19:31.791
Maybe because there were still folks
out there comparing it to the flu,

19:31.875 --> 19:35.041
which is like comparing Uruguay
to a banana.

19:35.125 --> 19:38.958
And one of those folks was the President.

19:40.083 --> 19:42.833
[Foss] Trump seemed to feel
that the virus was one of those things

19:42.916 --> 19:46.916
that goes away if you ignore it,
like a wasp or a wife.

19:47.000 --> 19:51.541
We're prepared, we're doing a great job
with it. It will go away, just stay calm.

19:51.625 --> 19:55.291
[director] In March, the President said
the pandemic would simply "go away."

19:55.375 --> 19:58.166
OK, see… [sighs]
This is what the media does.

19:58.250 --> 20:00.833
You lie, fabricate, fantasize.

20:00.916 --> 20:02.416
The president never said that.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.458
[Trump] It will go away. Stay calm.
We want to protect our shipping industry.

20:06.541 --> 20:10.166
OK, I know this doesn't fit
with your agenda, but this never happened.

20:10.666 --> 20:13.583
[narrator] But the pandemic does
the opposite of going away,

20:13.666 --> 20:15.375
as do the negative headlines.

20:15.458 --> 20:17.375
Trump needs to reassure the public.

20:17.458 --> 20:21.541
He hits the airwaves,
huddled tightly with close advisors.

20:21.625 --> 20:26.750
So, I'm glad to see that you're practicing
social distancing, that looks very nice.

20:26.833 --> 20:28.125
[narrator] By the end of March,

20:28.208 --> 20:30.708
lockdowns have been rolled out
right across the planet,

20:30.791 --> 20:34.166
making them
the most successful global franchise

20:34.250 --> 20:36.375
since the Marvel cinematic universe.

20:36.875 --> 20:40.250
In major cities, with clubs, bars,
and restaurants shuttered,

20:40.333 --> 20:43.041
everyday communal life
comes to a screeching halt.

20:43.125 --> 20:45.208
Human beings are social animals,

20:45.291 --> 20:48.541
so shutting down social interactions
goes against our instinct.

20:48.625 --> 20:50.541
I mean for most folks, not me!

20:50.625 --> 20:52.583
I fucking hate people.

20:52.666 --> 20:54.500
My God, it was bliss.

20:54.583 --> 20:56.958
[wind blowing]

20:57.041 --> 20:58.916
[slow suspenseful music playing]

20:59.000 --> 21:01.875
[Foss] Well, the lockdown
was absolutely transformative.

21:02.375 --> 21:03.833
It was as though

21:04.916 --> 21:06.250
time itself

21:07.250 --> 21:08.625
stood still.

21:08.708 --> 21:13.041
Life suddenly suspended in amber.

21:13.875 --> 21:17.166
Birds frozen in place in midair.

21:17.250 --> 21:21.791
The planet quite literally
stopped revolving.

21:21.875 --> 21:26.458
-[pigeons cooing]
-[Nerrick] It was so quiet

21:26.541 --> 21:29.750
you could actually hear yourself think.

21:31.708 --> 21:33.000
I expect.

21:33.500 --> 21:37.250
[narrator] Workplaces and everyday
businesses are forced to close.

21:37.333 --> 21:40.708
Particularly hard hit,
workers in the gig economy,

21:40.791 --> 21:44.250
millennials who often work
more than one job at a time.

21:44.333 --> 21:48.125
I can put my legs up and stuff,
that's OK if I have my feet up?

21:48.208 --> 21:50.250
I don't want my feet to fall, so…

21:50.333 --> 21:51.958
Yeah, my name's Duke Goolies.

21:52.041 --> 21:53.833
I'm a content provider.

21:53.916 --> 21:55.750
And I'm a barman slash mixologist.

21:56.958 --> 22:00.083
Yeah, it's definitely been challenging.
Uh…

22:01.041 --> 22:03.916
Listen, I don't want to be Mr. Mansplain,
but I kind of saw this coming

22:04.000 --> 22:08.458
because I was following coronavirus
back before…

22:08.541 --> 22:13.125
you know, pre-Wuhan days
when it was still inside of bats.

22:13.208 --> 22:14.541
I work a lot of jobs.

22:14.625 --> 22:18.333
In the lockdown, I've had to reposition
them to work on Zoom, you know.

22:18.416 --> 22:22.208
Like, I DJ at gender-neutral
gender reveal parties.

22:22.291 --> 22:23.291
Really important.

22:23.375 --> 22:26.750
[electronic music playing]

22:26.833 --> 22:28.125
Um…

22:28.208 --> 22:29.666
I work as a life coach.

22:30.416 --> 22:34.208
Amy, you can. OK, A…?

22:34.291 --> 22:37.583
Amy! Believe in yourself, OK? You can!

22:37.666 --> 22:38.916
Just shut up!

22:40.583 --> 22:45.583
The other area of growth for me has been
providing online content-tainment.

22:45.666 --> 22:50.541
The theaters are shut, so you can't see
your James Bonds or your Trolls 2.

22:50.625 --> 22:52.958
And the only film that did come out

22:53.041 --> 22:56.416
was about time being an endless loop,
which we all know now anyways.

22:56.500 --> 23:00.208
So, my YouTube channel
has gone total fuckbusters.

23:00.291 --> 23:03.416
Especially with the reaction videos
where I react to 2020.

23:03.500 --> 23:06.583
Guys, this literally looks like
Armageddon, we're living through it.

23:06.666 --> 23:10.083
Awesome, oh my gosh,
maybe like the bad version of awesome.

23:10.166 --> 23:14.291
Shittifying, fuckawfulicious.
I don't know!

23:14.375 --> 23:17.625
Oh, my God.
Don't forget to like and subscribe.

23:18.375 --> 23:22.500
They do crazy numbers. I mean, yeah,
there's so much material all year.

23:22.583 --> 23:24.291
Look at this man!

23:24.791 --> 23:27.833
He looks like a heap of balls!

23:27.916 --> 23:29.333
Never-ending.

23:29.416 --> 23:31.208
That's a big blast. Whoa.

23:31.291 --> 23:33.458
Whoa! Oh!

23:34.250 --> 23:36.875
I learned there's a lot of money
in creating streaming content.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.500
[director] How much
did you make this year?

23:41.000 --> 23:43.041
I wanna say…

23:44.375 --> 23:46.458
like 16 million dollars.

23:47.416 --> 23:48.291
[Big Ben chimes]

23:48.375 --> 23:51.791
[narrator] Meanwhile, in Britain,
in a bid to raise the country's spirits,

23:51.875 --> 23:55.458
the Queen prepares to deliver
a unifying speech.

23:55.541 --> 23:58.708
The monarch only addresses the nation
on special occasions,

23:58.791 --> 24:02.291
such as Christmas or the end of the world,
so this was a huge moment.

24:03.958 --> 24:06.000
[The Queen] Good evening, people of Earth.

24:06.583 --> 24:10.416
I speak to you at a time
of grave national crisis.

24:10.500 --> 24:14.291
Her Majesty rather successfully,
I thought, evoked the spirit of the Blitz,

24:14.375 --> 24:17.500
when Nazi bombs rained down nightly,

24:17.583 --> 24:20.708
obliterating streets and homes
and families on the ground.

24:20.791 --> 24:24.125
The kind of patriotic imagery
that we find so comforting.

24:24.708 --> 24:28.708
Defeating this enemy requires us
to bravely cower indoors.

24:28.791 --> 24:30.750
In addition to television,

24:30.833 --> 24:32.375
this was the first time

24:32.458 --> 24:36.333
one of one's speeches
was carried live on YouTube.

24:36.416 --> 24:39.208
[director] And did that affect
the content at all?

24:39.291 --> 24:40.416
Of course not.

24:40.500 --> 24:42.916
We will meet again.

24:44.125 --> 24:47.041
Now, smash that "Like" button
and don't forget to subscribe.

24:47.125 --> 24:51.291

my official regal merch.

24:51.375 --> 24:54.875
[narrator] But moments after her Majesty
delivers these stirring words,

24:54.958 --> 24:57.375
-the mood darkens.
-[BBC News theme tune]

24:57.458 --> 25:01.750
Tonight at ten, the Prime Minister Boris
Johnson has been taken to intensive care

25:01.833 --> 25:04.541
as he suffers the effects of coronavirus.

25:05.291 --> 25:07.333
[narrator] With the Brexit PM
in a critical condition,

25:07.416 --> 25:10.291
52% of the nation holds its breath.

25:10.375 --> 25:14.583
There was a real fear
that at a time of national crisis

25:14.666 --> 25:16.666
the Prime Minister
might have to be replaced

25:16.750 --> 25:19.208
by someone less qualified than him.

25:19.291 --> 25:20.833
Which would be impossible.

25:21.541 --> 25:23.750
Unless they were drawing up plans
to replace him

25:23.833 --> 25:26.458
with a sock or a balloon or something.

25:26.541 --> 25:29.708
[narrator] Just as the Prime Minister
might exit the realm of the living,

25:29.791 --> 25:31.708
a process known as Prexit,

25:31.791 --> 25:33.791
hospital staff nurse him back to health,

25:33.875 --> 25:36.958
and weeks later he's back on the job.

25:37.041 --> 25:41.458
Incredibly, the virus didn't seem
to have affected his abilities in any way.

25:41.541 --> 25:42.916
He still didn't have any.

25:43.000 --> 25:45.625
[narrator] News of Johnson's illness
proves that world leaders

25:45.708 --> 25:47.291
aren't naturally immune,

25:47.375 --> 25:50.083
yet some seem unwilling
to take precautions.

25:50.166 --> 25:53.500
[Bracket] Trump refused
to wear a mask for a long time.

25:53.583 --> 25:56.458
If someone told him white hoods
protected against the virus,

25:56.541 --> 25:58.208
maybe he'd have felt differently.

25:58.291 --> 26:02.208
[narrator] Egged on by the President,
some citizens also refuse to toe the line.

26:02.291 --> 26:04.916
Whoa! I thought I heard a voice.

26:05.000 --> 26:07.125
I thought I heard some Americans!

26:07.791 --> 26:10.875
[narrator] In several states,
protestors take to the streets,

26:10.958 --> 26:14.333
demanding their constitutional right
to spread the deadly virus.

26:14.416 --> 26:17.125
The online rumor mill is working overtime.

26:18.333 --> 26:21.041
When this whole thing started, um,

26:21.125 --> 26:25.875
there were so many wild rumors
flying around.

26:25.958 --> 26:28.750
So, I would watch Dr. Fauci
to get an anchor

26:28.833 --> 26:31.833
on what was actually happening, you know?

26:31.916 --> 26:37.791
And, um… even though it was so scary,
I found it really reassuring

26:37.875 --> 26:42.500
um, to watch someone
who is so accomplished

26:42.583 --> 26:46.208
calmly laying out the science.

26:46.291 --> 26:50.416
Um… but that was before I knew
he was an actor. Yeah.

26:50.500 --> 26:55.125
[director] And…
how did you come to learn that?

26:55.208 --> 26:59.375
Well, someone from my PTA WhatsApp group
shared a link to a documentary

26:59.458 --> 27:03.750
which proves that George Soros
created the virus in a Chinese lab

27:03.833 --> 27:06.875
so that Bill Gates could make
a vaccine out of microchips

27:06.958 --> 27:08.708
and control us all
like we're in a videogame.

27:08.791 --> 27:10.666
And I know, I know that sounds crazy,

27:10.750 --> 27:14.125
but the thing is,
we've seen him do this before.

27:14.708 --> 27:17.875
Right? Like when he crossed
a human with a paperclip

27:17.958 --> 27:21.833
and made that poor tormented monster
that haunted Windows 98.

27:21.916 --> 27:26.166
Of course, it wasn't surprising
that some folk were confused

27:26.250 --> 27:29.916
about the biology of this whole thing,
given the President seemed to be saying

27:30.000 --> 27:34.791
it could be cured with a kind of
sunlight-and-bleach wonder diet.

27:34.875 --> 27:37.500
Right, and then I see the disinfectant,

27:37.583 --> 27:40.708
where it knocks it out in a minute,
one minute,

27:40.791 --> 27:43.500
and is there a way we can do
something like that?

27:43.583 --> 27:46.875
[narrator] The remarks confuse
the President's own medical advisors,

27:46.958 --> 27:50.333
who visibly try to clamber
deep within their own souls to die.

27:50.416 --> 27:54.625
I guess if you could collapse
the past three and a half years of madness

27:54.708 --> 27:56.791
-into one clip--
-That would be it.

27:58.000 --> 28:01.583
[narrator] As May draws to a close,
for the first time in months,

28:01.666 --> 28:04.416
the coronavirus pandemic
is knocked from the headlines

28:04.500 --> 28:08.166
of every news network
by a different story altogether,

28:08.250 --> 28:10.625
one that also makes for grim viewing.

28:10.708 --> 28:13.375
The FBI is looking into the death
of a black man

28:13.458 --> 28:16.041
after he was stopped by police
in Minneapolis.

28:16.125 --> 28:17.875
The incident was caught on camera.

28:17.958 --> 28:20.083
George Floyd died in police custody

28:20.166 --> 28:24.583
after an officer pressed his knee into
Floyd's neck for at least seven minutes.

28:24.666 --> 28:26.750
Some people,
including the Minneapolis mayor,

28:26.833 --> 28:29.041
are already saying
the police used excessive force.

28:29.125 --> 28:32.166
[male reporter 1] Today, the mayor
called it "wrong at every level."

28:32.250 --> 28:34.666
What we saw was horrible.

28:34.750 --> 28:37.958
Fact is, those officers

28:38.041 --> 28:41.458
didn't see George Floyd as a human being,

28:41.541 --> 28:44.166
but the world did.

28:44.250 --> 28:47.250
[male reporter 2] Tonight the outrage
in Minneapolis is mounting,

28:47.333 --> 28:49.333
even after four officers were fired.

28:49.416 --> 28:52.000
Was it enough for you
that the officers were fired?

28:52.083 --> 28:54.583
That is not enough. That is not enough.

28:54.666 --> 28:56.750
The police have interesting priorities.

28:56.833 --> 28:59.333
When George Floyd, one black guy,

28:59.416 --> 29:03.875
tried, allegedly, to pass
one fake $20 bill in a liquor store,

29:03.958 --> 29:06.958
he had four cops on his ass
within minutes.

29:07.041 --> 29:08.458
And they killed him.

29:08.541 --> 29:11.291
Know how long it took
the same police department

29:11.375 --> 29:13.958
to arrest the prime suspects in that case?

29:14.625 --> 29:16.291
Four days.

29:16.375 --> 29:18.458
And they had that shit on tape!

29:18.541 --> 29:20.916
Did they think that was counterfeit too?

29:21.000 --> 29:23.625
[narrator] The George Floyd tragedy
is merely the latest

29:23.708 --> 29:26.500
in a long series of police killings
of black people,

29:26.583 --> 29:28.416
and it comes as a final straw.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.000
In increasing numbers,

29:30.083 --> 29:33.458
protestors take to the streets
to give voice to their anger.

29:33.541 --> 29:36.583
People said, "It's dangerous
to gather in crowds like that.

29:36.666 --> 29:38.583
What about the pandemic?"

29:38.666 --> 29:43.916
But, you know, in some ways
I prefer the coronavirus to the police.

29:44.000 --> 29:47.875
And don't get me wrong,
I fucking hate the virus,

29:47.958 --> 29:50.375
but at least it doesn't pretend
it's here to help.

29:50.458 --> 29:52.333
It doesn't drive around the neighborhood

29:52.416 --> 29:55.916
with "Protect and Serve"
painted on its side before it kills you.

29:57.125 --> 30:00.125
[Dr. Gravel] What happened
with George Floyd disgusted everybody.

30:01.250 --> 30:03.541
But it didn't surprise black people.

30:03.625 --> 30:06.208
We've always known
what cops are capable of.

30:06.791 --> 30:09.041
But today, bystanders got
a camera on their phones

30:09.125 --> 30:11.291
so now everybody gets to see it.

30:11.375 --> 30:12.708
And honestly?

30:12.791 --> 30:15.875
That ought to be the number one
sales feature for the iPhone.

30:15.958 --> 30:18.250
Fuck your "Megapixel Display."

30:18.333 --> 30:22.208
How about put "Exposes Police Brutality"
on the box?

30:23.208 --> 30:25.000
[narrator] Over the following days

30:25.083 --> 30:28.500
as tensions escalate
and police and protestors face off,

30:28.583 --> 30:30.541
some of the demonstrations turn violent.

30:30.625 --> 30:33.666
The President skillfully placates
the situation

30:33.750 --> 30:36.375
with some soothing incendiary comments.

30:36.458 --> 30:39.583
And in Washington,
he orders peaceful demonstrators

30:39.666 --> 30:43.750
to be gently dispersed
with some courteous state violence.

30:43.833 --> 30:49.041
-[protestors shouting]
-[tear gas grenades explode]

30:49.125 --> 30:51.083
[Dr. Gravel] Trump got riot police

30:51.166 --> 30:54.791
with tear gas and rubber bullets
to clear the protesters

30:54.875 --> 30:59.583
so he could pose for a photo
in front of St. John's Church.

30:59.666 --> 31:01.416
Because, you know,
when you live in a city,

31:01.500 --> 31:04.625
you never get to appreciate it
and do the touristy things.

31:05.833 --> 31:08.708
[narrator] Trump's gracious,
Christ-like diplomacy fails

31:08.791 --> 31:11.166
and violence continues to flare up.

31:12.250 --> 31:16.500
[Kathy Flowers] There was
so much anger expressed

31:16.583 --> 31:19.250
and emotions were running super high,

31:19.333 --> 31:21.250
so of course
there was going to be trouble.

31:21.916 --> 31:25.291
But… the sensible thing to do

31:25.375 --> 31:27.750
would have been to wait at home

31:27.833 --> 31:34.708
um… until everyone had just calmed down
and the whole thing had blown over,

31:34.791 --> 31:40.541
and then you go out and protest
in a, um… calm and orderly manner.

31:41.125 --> 31:43.541
Um… I would have been the first
to support that,

31:43.625 --> 31:46.375
unless it was on a Tuesday
because that's my Peloton class.

31:47.458 --> 31:54.458
But instead what was happening
just looked like all-out anarchy to me.

31:54.541 --> 32:00.375
Um… and believe me, I, uh…
I know criminal behavior when I see it.

32:00.458 --> 32:05.541
Whether it's someone breaking a window
or a black man sitting in a car.

32:05.625 --> 32:07.375
[director] Wasn't there a video of you

32:07.458 --> 32:10.833
haranguing a black man sitting in a car
that went viral this year?

32:12.916 --> 32:16.041
[man] And I'm telling you this is my car.

32:16.125 --> 32:19.291
Well, then I'm sure you'll prove that
with some ID. Yeah.

32:19.375 --> 32:23.625
First of all, I… [chuckles]
I wasn't haranguing.

32:23.708 --> 32:27.291
I was politely enquiring,
for less than an hour.

32:27.875 --> 32:30.791
[director] So, that was the only time
you did something like that this year?

32:32.125 --> 32:34.916
Um… there was an incident at a pool.

32:35.916 --> 32:37.750
-[woman] Give it back!
-Do you have a receipt?

32:37.833 --> 32:39.166
I need to see a receipt.

32:39.250 --> 32:42.125
Uh… there was an incident up in the hills.

32:43.000 --> 32:44.625
[man] I'm painting a watercolor!

32:44.708 --> 32:47.916
The way that you're wielding
that paintbrush is very unsettling to me.

32:48.000 --> 32:49.250
And at the hospital.

32:49.333 --> 32:52.750
Sweetie, are you absolutely sure
that this is your dialysis machine?

32:52.833 --> 32:56.458
-[girl] Mommy, the crazy lady's back.
-I was just asking. I'm allowed to ask.

32:56.541 --> 33:01.291
[voice breaking] I don't know why people
are so quick to judge.

33:01.375 --> 33:02.791
[sniffles]

33:07.916 --> 33:09.291
[whispering] Is he with you?

33:11.125 --> 33:13.666
[director] That's Mike.
He's been here all day.

33:17.708 --> 33:20.208
[narrator] By now, the protests
have gone international,

33:20.291 --> 33:23.083
with a rallying cry
reverberating across the globe.

33:23.583 --> 33:26.416
-Black Lives Matter!
-Black Lives Matter!

33:26.500 --> 33:29.375
Black Lives Matter.

33:30.958 --> 33:34.750
Well… no reasonable person
could disagree with that,

33:34.833 --> 33:38.666
but I would prefer to say,
"All lives matter."

33:39.416 --> 33:42.875
[director] I think the point is they're
currently treated like they don't matter.

33:42.958 --> 33:45.250
All lives? I don't think so.

33:45.333 --> 33:46.750
[director] No, black lives.

33:46.833 --> 33:48.583
Oh, those.

33:49.875 --> 33:51.541
I'm sorry, what about them?

33:52.500 --> 33:54.541
-[director] They matter.
-More than all lives?

33:54.625 --> 33:57.125
-Now who's being a racist?
-[director] I didn't call you a racist.

33:57.208 --> 34:01.500
You are. You are just about to label me
a bigot, just like my daughter.

34:01.583 --> 34:05.083
And her friends, and my son,
and his friends.

34:05.166 --> 34:06.625
And my wife.

34:07.208 --> 34:08.458
And her friends.

34:09.708 --> 34:11.291
And my friends.

34:12.333 --> 34:14.333
You can't say anything these days.

34:17.250 --> 34:20.958
[narrator] Next, the spotlight falls upon
the relics of an intolerant past.

34:21.041 --> 34:25.708
In Bristol, England, protestors surround
slave trader and statue Edward Colston

34:25.791 --> 34:28.583
and drag him
from the safety of his plinth.

34:28.666 --> 34:30.000
[protesters shouting]

34:30.083 --> 34:32.916
Look, these people are trying
to destroy history.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.708
[director] What if by tearing
these statues down

34:35.791 --> 34:37.708
they're actually making history?

34:41.541 --> 34:43.750
Shut up and move on.

34:44.750 --> 34:46.166
[protesters shouting]

34:46.250 --> 34:48.666
[Nerrick] They threw him in the sea,
which is cruel.

34:48.750 --> 34:50.333
They might have killed him.

34:50.416 --> 34:52.791
Can statues breathe underwater?

34:53.791 --> 34:55.416
No, they don't breathe at all.

34:55.916 --> 34:58.333
OK, so he probably swam to safety.

34:59.458 --> 35:02.041
[Bracket] You had corporations
going woke too,

35:02.125 --> 35:05.416
asking themselves
how can they support black people

35:05.500 --> 35:07.166
without actually paying them.

35:07.250 --> 35:08.750
Demonstrating their sensitivity

35:08.833 --> 35:12.750
by rebranding Ku Klux Krunchies
as Rosa Parks Puffs,

35:12.833 --> 35:13.916
and so on.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.375
I'm proud to say as a corporation
we stepped up in several bold ways.

35:18.458 --> 35:21.375
We rolled out an update
that replaced our virtual assistants

35:21.458 --> 35:23.458
with the personality of Malcolm X.

35:24.458 --> 35:26.958
[man] Malcolm, could you play
the best of ZZ Top?

35:27.041 --> 35:30.250
[imitates Malcolm X] I will neither follow
your orders nor recognize your authority.

35:30.333 --> 35:33.875
But perhaps our biggest gesture
was the whole Boris Johnson thing.

35:34.916 --> 35:36.875
We've had great ties with UK government

35:36.958 --> 35:38.833
since we delivered the Brexit vote
for them.

35:38.916 --> 35:41.333
And they'd reached out
looking for a gesture to show

35:41.416 --> 35:43.791
Britain had shrugged off
its colonial past,

35:43.875 --> 35:47.166
which was a little slave-tradey.

35:47.250 --> 35:49.583
So, we had them trial our body swap tech.

35:49.666 --> 35:52.875
This is the first time the soul
of a British Prime Minister

35:52.958 --> 35:55.958
has been transferred
into the body of a black man.

35:56.750 --> 35:58.250
And it worked.

35:58.833 --> 36:02.541
[imitating Boris Johnson] Today,
I stand before you as a proud black man,

36:02.625 --> 36:06.666
a thrusting, living symbol
of vibrant modern Britain.

36:06.750 --> 36:08.791
I will now take questions.

36:08.875 --> 36:12.666
-Yes, the lady with her hand up?
-You're not from round here, are you?

36:12.750 --> 36:14.583
[man 1] Have you got a receipt
for that suit?

36:14.666 --> 36:17.541
-Well, not a receipt per se--
-[man 2] Officer, arrest this man!

36:18.166 --> 36:20.416
When I say worked,
I mean temporarily, you know,

36:20.500 --> 36:23.791
We had to revert Johnson back into his
natural form so he could continue ruling

36:23.875 --> 36:27.458
from a position of safe,
familiar white incompetence.

36:27.541 --> 36:30.125
[narrator] Some white individuals
begin to ask

36:30.208 --> 36:32.500
whether they're doing enough personally.

36:33.500 --> 36:35.416
Well, I consider myself an ally.

36:36.458 --> 36:39.500
You know, but I looked within,
I felt I could make some changes.

36:39.583 --> 36:43.500
So, I started small,
posting the black squares on Insta.

36:44.250 --> 36:47.916
I swapped to only using
black emojis for texts.

36:48.416 --> 36:51.750
I sent a lot of friend requests
to black people.

36:51.833 --> 36:54.833
And I even learned
how to pronounce their names.

36:54.916 --> 36:56.291
Even if it was difficult.

36:57.000 --> 37:00.458
A-de-fo-la-ke.

37:00.541 --> 37:01.916
A-de-fo-la-ke.

37:02.458 --> 37:03.833
Hmm, beautiful.

37:03.916 --> 37:07.375
And then I thought, listen, look.
I know I care,

37:08.250 --> 37:11.708
but do enough other people
know that I care?

37:12.958 --> 37:16.208
I realized I should up my game,
so I posted a video about it.

37:17.416 --> 37:21.541
And so I guess in a way,
I'm black too, maybe…

37:21.625 --> 37:23.666
maybe more than anyone.

37:23.750 --> 37:26.125
That caught some likes,
so we did a follow-up

37:26.208 --> 37:31.166
where I drove around a black neighborhood
to let them hear my support in person.

37:31.750 --> 37:35.750
Guys, I just want to say, right now,
I'm with you.

37:35.833 --> 37:40.083
I hear you. I see you. I am you.

37:40.166 --> 37:44.541
And this wasn't just some quick
little gesture, we kept it up till 2 a.m.

37:44.625 --> 37:46.000
That's how committed we were.

37:46.083 --> 37:51.125
Friends of color, I stand by you.
I feel your pain.

37:51.208 --> 37:54.416
-[man] Go the fuck home!
-Oh shit, drive. Drive. Go, go, go!

37:54.500 --> 37:55.791
[engine revving]

37:55.875 --> 37:58.166
There's just no pleasing some people.

37:59.166 --> 38:01.875
[narrator] All the while,
the pandemic is raging out of control

38:01.958 --> 38:04.125
and there is disagreement
on how to respond.

38:04.208 --> 38:08.250
Some believe the only way out
is to achieve herd immunity.

38:08.333 --> 38:10.041
[Pyrex Flask] Herd immunity occurs

38:10.125 --> 38:13.041
when almost everybody
has been exposed to something,

38:13.125 --> 38:15.541
but gotten over it,
so it quickly dies out.

38:15.625 --> 38:17.916
Just like what happened with the Floss.

38:18.916 --> 38:20.625
[director] Sorry, the… the what?

38:20.708 --> 38:21.708
You know…

38:28.625 --> 38:31.375
[narrator] Others want to wait
for a miracle cure,

38:31.458 --> 38:34.833
but any potential vaccine faces
a lengthy uphill climb,

38:34.916 --> 38:37.333
a challenging maneuver for any liquid.

38:37.416 --> 38:40.375
Well, vaccines go through
a lengthy approval process.

38:40.458 --> 38:44.750
They start with the preliminary trials
using a limited number of volunteers

38:44.833 --> 38:49.583
in which we are monitoring the level
of proteins known as antibodies generated.

38:49.666 --> 38:51.583
It is called a blind trial

38:51.666 --> 38:55.083
because around half the volunteers
are given a placebo, which means…

38:55.166 --> 38:59.750
Sorry. Sorry, why are you showing
footage of whatever that is?

38:59.833 --> 39:02.583
I'm still speaking. Is that relevant?

39:02.666 --> 39:06.583
Yeah, sorry. We're just trying to keep it
visually interesting. Ignore us. Carry on.

39:07.666 --> 39:09.541
No, OK. No problem, OK.

39:09.625 --> 39:14.666
So, once the initial trial is complete,
the second trial begins.

39:14.750 --> 39:18.666
This is less to do with efficacy
because during the second trial

39:18.750 --> 39:21.541
there's a tricky balance
you are trying to maintain

39:21.625 --> 39:25.166
between monitoring
the serological response and how that…

39:25.250 --> 39:29.000
What's going on? That's got
nothing to do with this. This…

39:29.083 --> 39:30.333
I'm talking here.

39:30.416 --> 39:33.083
Just… just ignore it, OK.
It's just texture.

39:34.125 --> 39:36.833
Are you guys actually interested
in the science?

39:36.916 --> 39:40.250
Um… to be honest… no.

39:42.750 --> 39:43.750
Oh.

39:44.375 --> 39:47.000
[narrator] With no cure
for Covid in sight,

39:47.083 --> 39:50.291
life for millions has been reduced
to a creepy new normal

39:50.375 --> 39:53.458
and a seemingly endless series
of lockdowns.

39:53.541 --> 39:56.833
I live on my own
and after a while I got so lonely

39:56.916 --> 40:00.250
I developed a multiple personality
disorder on purpose

40:00.333 --> 40:02.250
so I could keep myself company.

40:02.333 --> 40:04.750
But then, of course, I had to try and keep

40:04.833 --> 40:07.708
two meters away from myself at all times.

40:08.208 --> 40:12.500
Don't know if you've ever tried doing that
but it's a bloody nightmare.

40:13.791 --> 40:17.000
So, I started doing video calls
to keep sociable.

40:17.083 --> 40:20.500
-Hiya, you alright?
-[man on laptop] No, is what it is, innit?

40:20.583 --> 40:24.166
I did so many
I sometimes glitch in real life now.

40:24.250 --> 40:26.333
Like, I just freeze now and then, like…

40:32.083 --> 40:33.666
Can you hear me your end?

40:34.583 --> 40:39.125
[narrator] Like defecating and sobbing,
video calls become part of everyday life,

40:39.208 --> 40:41.708
which means for some, business is booming.

40:41.791 --> 40:43.625
Early on, we ran some numbers and realized

40:43.708 --> 40:47.875
that around 20% of our customer base
might die of the virus.

40:47.958 --> 40:51.750
But the surviving 80%
would increase their reliance

40:51.833 --> 40:54.875
on our videoconferencing products
200 fold,

40:54.958 --> 40:57.666
so that was a huge win for us.

40:57.750 --> 41:00.166
A huge but sad win.

41:00.666 --> 41:01.916
[narrator] In desperation,

41:02.000 --> 41:05.541
millions turn to award-winning
streaming service Netflix

41:05.625 --> 41:07.083
for entertainment.

41:08.125 --> 41:11.333
One spent a lot of time at Windsor
watching Netflix.

41:12.000 --> 41:16.000
[director] Do you find that you spend most
of your time browsing the home page?

41:16.083 --> 41:18.958
No. No, my footman does that for me.

41:19.708 --> 41:21.708
[Dr. Gravel] I watched so much dumb shit.

41:21.791 --> 41:25.083
You see Floor is Lava,
fire and brimstone, the game show?

41:25.166 --> 41:27.250
-[female presenter] Don't…
-[woman] No!

41:27.333 --> 41:29.375
-Fall…
-[man 1 groans]

41:29.458 --> 41:30.916
-In…
-[man 2 groans]

41:31.000 --> 41:32.750
-The…
-[man 3] Ah!

41:32.833 --> 41:33.875
…lava!

41:33.958 --> 41:36.291
You know they filmed that last year,
because in 2020

41:36.375 --> 41:38.666
people wouldn't even be bothering
to try to escape the lava.

41:38.750 --> 41:41.375
They'd be lining up
to willingly throw themselves in,

41:41.458 --> 41:43.291
pausing only to kick their kids in first.

41:43.875 --> 41:45.583
Maybe that's season two.

41:46.291 --> 41:49.666
[The Queen] My favorite program
has to be The Crown.

41:50.416 --> 41:53.208
It's refreshing to see
a down-to-earth drama

41:53.291 --> 41:56.125
about everyday people
living ordinary lives.

41:56.208 --> 41:59.625
It's the sort of thing
that gives the little people hope.

41:59.708 --> 42:02.333
Some say The Crown is unrealistic,

42:02.416 --> 42:06.125
but it strikes me as a far more
faithful depiction of the monarchy

42:06.208 --> 42:09.500
than their other regal drama, Tiger King.

42:09.583 --> 42:12.458
You can guaran-goddamn-tee
I'm gonna put a cap in your ass

42:12.541 --> 42:15.083
the first time
to make you squirm around on the ground.

42:15.166 --> 42:17.791
Then I'm gonna put a bullet
between your fucking eyes.

42:17.875 --> 42:21.500
That man is from no royal line
I recognize.

42:22.916 --> 42:24.583
[dir.] Harry and Meghan have
a Netflix deal.

42:24.666 --> 42:25.791
Harry and who-an?

42:26.708 --> 42:28.916
-[director] Harry and Meghan.
-Who-ey and who-an?

42:29.458 --> 42:33.375
[narrator] Back in the real world,
with America facing crises on every front,

42:33.458 --> 42:36.125
criticism of the President is mounting.

42:37.416 --> 42:40.083
Also, there were questions
about his fitness to govern,

42:40.166 --> 42:43.750
in part because of the way he had to
drink a glass of water using both hands,

42:43.833 --> 42:45.791
but mainly because of
everything else he did.

42:45.875 --> 42:49.458
[narrator] To boost support,
Trump announces a series of rallies.

42:50.041 --> 42:54.541
We've had a tremendous run at rallies.
I don't think there's been an empty seat.

42:54.625 --> 42:57.291
[narrator] But despite a surge
in ticket requests,

42:57.375 --> 43:01.291
an event in Oklahoma is mainly attended
by people who aren't there.

43:01.375 --> 43:03.166
As the media makes clear,

43:03.250 --> 43:06.916
heartless users of the social media
platform TikTok are to blame.

43:07.500 --> 43:10.583
[female reporter] TikTokers said
they intentionally sabotaged the event

43:10.666 --> 43:15.041
by registering en masse
with no intention of showing up,

43:15.125 --> 43:17.000
and they spread the word via TikTok.

43:17.083 --> 43:19.375
[narrator] Republicans claim social media

43:19.458 --> 43:23.583
is actively trying to suppress
an unreasonable conservative agenda.

43:24.583 --> 43:27.791
I'll cut to the chase,
Big Tech is out to get conservatives.

43:27.875 --> 43:30.875
That's not a suspicion,
that's not a hunch. That's a fact.

43:30.958 --> 43:33.958
The fact, which doesn't care
about your feelings,

43:34.041 --> 43:36.333
is that online and in the media

43:36.416 --> 43:39.458
conservative voices are being silenced.

43:39.541 --> 43:42.458
I've said this before.
I said it on my YouTube channel.

43:42.541 --> 43:44.541
Conservative voices are being silenced.

43:44.625 --> 43:45.958
I said it on Joe Rogan.

43:46.041 --> 43:47.916
Conservative voices are being silenced.

43:48.000 --> 43:50.125
On the Jordan Peterson Kayak podcast.

43:50.208 --> 43:52.458
Conservative voices are being silenced.

43:52.541 --> 43:54.250
I said it on Tucker Carlson.

43:54.333 --> 43:57.000
Tucker, we know Conservative voices
are being silenced.

43:57.083 --> 43:58.250
Twice actually.

43:58.333 --> 44:01.583
Like I said last time, Tucker,
Conservative voices are being silenced.

44:01.666 --> 44:03.000
That is exactly right.

44:03.083 --> 44:05.541
And I said it
in my New York Times bestseller,

44:05.625 --> 44:08.166
Conservative Voices Are Being Silenced.

44:08.250 --> 44:10.833
It's a point I have to make over and over

44:10.916 --> 44:15.583
because Conservative voices
are being silenced.

44:15.666 --> 44:19.041
-In fact, you won't even use this footage.
-Actually, we will.

44:19.125 --> 44:21.250
Bob, we both know
that's not going to happen.

44:21.333 --> 44:23.791
-Yeah, my name is James.
-Whatever, Bob.

44:24.958 --> 44:27.208
[narrator] On the opposite side
of the political divide,

44:27.291 --> 44:30.125
the husk of Joe Biden
is encountering setbacks.

44:30.208 --> 44:33.250
He is the oldest presidential candidate
since records began,

44:33.333 --> 44:35.291
200 years after he was born,

44:35.375 --> 44:38.458
and questions are asked
about his longevity.

44:38.541 --> 44:40.500
[woman] Biden is clearly diminished.

44:40.583 --> 44:44.666
All men and women were created by the…
Go, you know the thing.

44:44.750 --> 44:46.500
He seemed kind of frail.

44:46.583 --> 44:48.041
Never mind the virus,

44:48.125 --> 44:51.875
there were times it looked like
a stiff breeze might be too much for him.

44:51.958 --> 44:56.458
So, he stayed in his basement,
running a virtual campaign.

44:56.541 --> 44:59.625
Which is like a real campaign
that never really happens.

44:59.708 --> 45:06.000
So, welcome, everybody,
to our first virtual happy hour.

45:06.583 --> 45:09.166
He might as well have been
in witness protection.

45:09.250 --> 45:13.083
But there came a time
he had to venture out.

45:13.166 --> 45:16.250
His team were clearly extremely cautious.

45:16.333 --> 45:19.583
Whenever he met the public,
they made him sit some distance away

45:19.666 --> 45:22.875
so he couldn't face further allegations
of inappropriate touching.

45:22.958 --> 45:24.791
And they prevented verbal gaffes

45:24.875 --> 45:27.500
by keeping him physically gagged
at all times.

45:28.083 --> 45:32.083
[narrator] Biden also hosts
COVID-safe drive-in rallies,

45:32.166 --> 45:34.750
attended by handfuls of enthusiastic cars,

45:34.833 --> 45:38.833
in which he channels the vibrant energy
of an old man yelling at traffic.

45:38.916 --> 45:41.333
And we should have no tolerance

45:41.416 --> 45:45.333
for extremist white supremacist groups
marching in our communities.

45:45.416 --> 45:51.875
[horns honking]

45:52.625 --> 45:56.708
[narrator] But his campaign gets a shot
in the arm as he picks his running mate.

45:56.791 --> 46:00.541
Now let me introduce to you,
for the first time,

46:00.625 --> 46:02.958
your next Vice President
of the United States,

46:03.041 --> 46:04.958
Kamala Harris.

46:05.041 --> 46:07.125
Kamala, the floor is yours.

46:07.208 --> 46:10.916
[narrator] At 55, Harris is less
than a quarter of Biden's age.

46:11.000 --> 46:12.500
She is the first African American

46:12.583 --> 46:15.708
and South Asian American
vice presidential candidate,

46:15.791 --> 46:17.875
and, therefore, alongside Donald Trump

46:17.958 --> 46:21.333
is the second person of color
on the 2020 ballot.

46:21.916 --> 46:23.375
We're all in this fight.

46:24.125 --> 46:28.458
You, me and Joe, together.

46:28.541 --> 46:32.083
Well, previously,
Biden and Harris hadn't got on.

46:32.166 --> 46:34.625
She'd clashed with Biden at the primaries.

46:34.708 --> 46:40.041
Do you agree today that you were wrong
to oppose busing in America?

46:40.125 --> 46:44.916
And last year said that she believed
the women who accused him of impropriety.

46:45.000 --> 46:47.041
Now, all that was forgiven.

46:47.125 --> 46:50.625
Although their relationship
did appear a little standoffish.

46:50.708 --> 46:53.041
And, of course, if they won,

46:53.125 --> 46:55.958
she'd be president
in the event of Biden's death.

46:56.041 --> 46:58.041
Assuming anyone noticed.

46:58.833 --> 47:01.333
[narrator] Biden's campaign
is reenergized,

47:01.416 --> 47:05.166
but the American story is about to take
an unexpected turn

47:05.250 --> 47:07.250
as the world looks on.

47:07.333 --> 47:11.083
[dog barking]

47:11.166 --> 47:13.666
[Nerrick] Having another lockdown
was really annoying

47:13.750 --> 47:18.625
because I'd watched literally
all of Netflix during the first lockdown.

47:18.708 --> 47:23.375
But then I got into this show called
America, which was amazing.

47:23.458 --> 47:26.500
Have you seen it?
It's on the news channel.

47:26.583 --> 47:28.791
It's totally mental.

47:28.875 --> 47:31.000
Just one twist after another.

47:31.083 --> 47:33.375
They had this sort
of election fight happening

47:33.458 --> 47:36.666
between a bloke who looked
like a ticket inspector on a ghost train

47:36.750 --> 47:41.250
and an inflatable orange maniac who
didn't seem to be dealing with the plague.

47:41.333 --> 47:43.250
We have so much testing,

47:43.333 --> 47:46.000
I don't think you need that kind
of testing or that much testing,

47:46.083 --> 47:50.250
but some people disagree with me
and some people agree with me.

47:50.333 --> 47:55.250
[Nerrick] Everybody hated everybody else,
and the whole country was on fire.

47:55.333 --> 47:58.791
Not just the forests
but the towns and cities.

47:59.750 --> 48:02.416
The only thing that wasn't on fire
was the fucking sea

48:02.500 --> 48:04.541
and that was probably thinking about it.

48:04.625 --> 48:06.583
As if all that wasn't enough,

48:06.666 --> 48:11.125
they dropped in an unexpected twist
involving a beloved character.

48:12.833 --> 48:14.666
This is a Fox News alert.

48:14.750 --> 48:18.000
US Supreme Court Justice
Ruth Bader Ginsburg

48:18.083 --> 48:20.416
has died at the age of 87.

48:20.500 --> 48:24.375
[narrator] Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg
was a feminist icon and trailblazer

48:24.458 --> 48:26.750
who fought for abortion rights,

48:26.833 --> 48:31.458
gender equality, and a 600-mile
gas pipeline through indigenous land.

48:31.541 --> 48:35.541
RBG's dying wish was that she
wouldn't be replaced on the Supreme Court

48:35.625 --> 48:38.291
until the next president was sworn in.

48:38.375 --> 48:42.125
But that dying wish died with her.

48:42.208 --> 48:44.375
Breaking tonight, Fox News has confirmed

48:44.458 --> 48:47.541
President Trump will nominate
Amy Coney Barrett

48:47.625 --> 48:49.458
as the next Supreme Court Justice.

48:50.041 --> 48:52.708
[narrator] As Fox News made
bombastically clear,

48:52.791 --> 48:55.583
Trump selected Amy Coney Barrett,
a devout Catholic

48:55.666 --> 48:59.500
who claims a legal career is
"a means to an end of serving God."

49:00.458 --> 49:02.333
God was unavailable for comment.

49:02.833 --> 49:07.625
Amy Coney Barrett stands for everything
RBG was against, everything!

49:07.708 --> 49:09.791
She's so pro-life, I got a theory.

49:09.875 --> 49:13.375
She's secretly bankrolled
by the wire hanger industry.

49:13.958 --> 49:15.375
[narrator] September 26th,

49:15.458 --> 49:18.666
and The White House throws
a ceremony in the Rose Garden,

49:18.750 --> 49:21.250
announcing Coney Barrett's nomination.

49:21.333 --> 49:25.708
It is a roll call of the great and good
and soon to be infected.

49:26.208 --> 49:28.666
Most of the president's inner circle
was there,

49:28.750 --> 49:32.833
although the most significant attendee
was the novel coronavirus,

49:32.916 --> 49:35.250
silently mingling among the guests,

49:35.333 --> 49:38.333
particularly the ones
who didn't believe in it yet.

49:39.416 --> 49:43.208
[narrator] But in the following days, the
President is beset by other distractions.

49:43.291 --> 49:46.125
The New York Times uncovers
his tax returns,

49:46.208 --> 49:50.250
revealing that, like all top businessmen,
he has made no money in years.

49:51.375 --> 49:56.583
September 29th, and the first presidential
debate makes for illuminating television.

49:56.666 --> 49:58.708
I'm Chris Wallace of Fox News,

49:58.791 --> 50:02.333
and I welcome you to the first
of the 2020 presidential debates.

50:03.083 --> 50:05.958
[Dr. Gravel] Trump comes out
just like regular Trump, grouchy,

50:06.041 --> 50:08.416
like something was eating him up
on the inside.

50:08.500 --> 50:10.583
Which of course we now know it was.

50:10.666 --> 50:13.291
While Biden's just trying to look alive.

50:13.375 --> 50:14.916
And then the debate started

50:15.000 --> 50:18.291
and straightaway it was
like a rap battle in a senior home.

50:18.375 --> 50:19.541
But worse.

50:19.625 --> 50:22.333
-[Biden] The question is…
-[Trump] The new Supreme Court Justice…

50:22.416 --> 50:25.375
-…the radical left.
-Will you shut up, man.

50:25.458 --> 50:27.333
I'd say it was a train wreck
and a shitshow,

50:27.416 --> 50:30.083
but that would be unfair
to trains and shit.

50:30.166 --> 50:31.583
Well, it's incredible, really.

50:31.666 --> 50:37.541
73 million Americans witnessing a debate
as intellectually stimulating

50:37.625 --> 50:41.625
as watching two pigeons fight
over a piece of bread in a car lot.

50:41.708 --> 50:44.000
[narrator] A key moment comes
when Trump is asked

50:44.083 --> 50:47.208
to condemn white supremacists
and fumbles the response.

50:47.291 --> 50:48.958
What do you wanna call them?

50:49.041 --> 50:52.250
-Who would you like me to condemn?
-[Biden] The Proud Boys.

50:52.333 --> 50:55.375
Proud Boys, stand back and stand by.

50:55.458 --> 50:57.916
He told those guys to stand by.

50:58.458 --> 51:00.250
That's not disavowing.

51:00.750 --> 51:03.041
That's pumping a fucking shotgun.

51:03.666 --> 51:06.416
[narrator] Following the debate,
the only positive news for Trump

51:06.500 --> 51:08.458
is his coronavirus test result,

51:08.541 --> 51:11.500
which prompts negative blanket coverage.

51:11.583 --> 51:13.500
[announcer] It starts with breaking news…

51:13.583 --> 51:18.250
Breaking news, President Trump
has tested positive for coronavirus.

51:18.333 --> 51:21.666
It is extraordinary
on many different levels.

51:21.750 --> 51:23.791
No one saw that coming.

51:23.875 --> 51:25.333
Oh, let me rephrase that.

51:26.250 --> 51:28.791
Everyone saw that coming.

51:28.875 --> 51:31.166
We just didn't believe
it'd actually happen.

51:31.250 --> 51:34.500
Well then, of course, the people
surrounding him all start falling ill.

51:34.583 --> 51:38.041
Even Melania, who'd been
socially distancing from him

51:38.125 --> 51:40.125
for the past four years.

51:40.208 --> 51:42.750
[director] The President didn't exactly
take precautions, did he?

51:42.833 --> 51:45.416
Sorry, are you saying this was his fault?

51:45.500 --> 51:47.333
[director] Well, he rarely wore a mask.

51:47.416 --> 51:49.041
Didn't wear a mask?

51:49.125 --> 51:53.291
Are you saying because of the way
he was dressed he was asking for it?

51:53.375 --> 51:57.958
Because that, my friend, is victim blaming
and you should hang your head in shame.

51:58.041 --> 52:01.750
[narrator] As an overweight
74-year-old male, Trump is at low risk

52:01.833 --> 52:05.083
of appearing on the cover
of Sports Illustrated's Swimsuit issue.

52:05.166 --> 52:07.208
but at high-risk from coronavirus.

52:07.291 --> 52:08.791
As his condition worsens,

52:08.875 --> 52:10.875
he's transported to Walter Reed Hospital

52:10.958 --> 52:13.041
and the world holds its breath.

52:13.708 --> 52:17.958
It was actually a moment
of national unity.

52:18.708 --> 52:22.750
Whatever their political alliance,
everyone in America was praying that day.

52:22.833 --> 52:24.333
For different outcomes.

52:24.416 --> 52:27.416
[Nerrick] So, the President
is in a military hospital

52:27.500 --> 52:31.291
getting injected
with an experimental antibody treatment.

52:31.375 --> 52:35.125
By now, I'm thinking
this storyline's far-fetched,

52:35.208 --> 52:38.625
but I'm well into this,
I'm bingeing the shit out of it.

52:38.708 --> 52:41.625
[narrator] Well-wishers outside
the hospital show their support

52:41.708 --> 52:45.375
and are rewarded when the President
commandeers a Secret Service vehicle

52:45.458 --> 52:48.083
to perform the most dangerous drive-by

52:48.166 --> 52:50.541
since the final moments of Tupac Shakur.

52:50.625 --> 52:53.833
Then there was this mental bit
where he flew back to the White House

52:53.916 --> 52:55.958
and stood on the balcony
and took his mask off

52:56.041 --> 53:00.375
so we'd know it was actually him
and not a beautiful woman in disguise.

53:00.458 --> 53:03.625
Then he proved
both his thumbs still worked.

53:03.708 --> 53:05.208
Thank God.

53:05.291 --> 53:07.458
And he saluted a helicopter,

53:07.541 --> 53:10.166
which couldn't see him
because it was flying away.

53:10.250 --> 53:13.375
The production values
were through the roof.

53:13.458 --> 53:16.541
It looked like the final shot
in the season finale of America.

53:16.625 --> 53:20.333
So, I was quite surprised
when the country kept going after that.

53:20.833 --> 53:22.416
[Foss] It was quite remarkable really,

53:22.500 --> 53:25.583
one of the most iconic moments in history
that any of us will live through,

53:25.666 --> 53:28.916
but also deeply profoundly stupid.

53:29.000 --> 53:32.791
The history books covering this period
will have to be written in crayon.

53:33.500 --> 53:34.875
By a dog.

53:34.958 --> 53:37.583
I stood out front, I led.

53:37.666 --> 53:41.666
Nobody that's a leader
would not do what I did.

53:41.750 --> 53:45.250
And I know there's a risk,
there's a danger, but that's OK.

53:45.333 --> 53:48.458
And now I'm better and maybe I'm immune,
I don't know.

53:48.541 --> 53:49.833
[narrator] Despite his ordeal,

53:49.916 --> 53:52.625
Trump seems to have gained little sympathy
from the US public

53:52.708 --> 53:54.958
and is cratering in the polls.

53:55.041 --> 53:59.041
Right about now, it looked like Trump
needed some kind of October surprise

53:59.125 --> 54:01.333
to wipe the smile off Biden's skull.

54:01.416 --> 54:02.958
[narrator] In a bombshell report,

54:03.041 --> 54:07.666
Hunter Biden is accused of introducing
his father to a Ukrainian businessman.

54:07.750 --> 54:09.458
[director] You said Ukraine didn't exist.

54:09.541 --> 54:10.541
That's not relevant.

54:10.625 --> 54:14.166
What is relevant is the total silence
from the mainstream media.

54:14.250 --> 54:16.708
No-one was asking
about Hunter Biden anywhere.

54:16.791 --> 54:18.166
It's like I said on Joe Rogan.

54:18.250 --> 54:19.750
What about Hunter Biden?

54:19.833 --> 54:21.208
And on Tucker Carlson…

54:21.291 --> 54:22.458
What about Hunter Biden?

54:22.541 --> 54:23.500
More than once.

54:23.583 --> 54:24.875
What about Hunter Biden?

54:24.958 --> 54:27.125
Let's hope that evidence
arrives in the mail.

54:27.208 --> 54:28.416
That is exactly right.

54:28.500 --> 54:32.458
And I said it in my New York Times
bestseller, What About Hunter Biden?

54:33.541 --> 54:36.583
-[director] What about Hunter Biden?
-You don't even want to ask about it!

54:37.083 --> 54:41.208
[narrator] As the crucial day nears,
other factors make 2020's election

54:41.291 --> 54:44.041
as unpredictable
as an ape with a hockey stick.

54:44.125 --> 54:47.416
The pandemic forces states
to introduce widespread postal voting,

54:47.500 --> 54:51.583
dragging the US electoral system
into the 19th century.

54:52.791 --> 54:55.541
[Bracket] Trump supporters were gonna vote
in person on election day

54:55.625 --> 54:57.833
because they weren't afraid of the virus.

54:58.666 --> 54:59.958
Or fascism.

55:00.041 --> 55:03.708
Covid-cautious Democrats
were more likely to vote by post

55:03.791 --> 55:06.625
from the comfort
of their liberal elitist homes,

55:06.708 --> 55:10.541
wearing a mask and swabbing the pencil
down with bleach when they'd finished.

55:10.625 --> 55:13.833
[narrator] Advance in-person voting
also explodes.

55:13.916 --> 55:17.791
Lines stretch for miles as Americans
wait for a go on their democracy.

55:17.875 --> 55:23.000
[Flowers] It was so inspiring to see
so many Americans voting. Um…

55:23.083 --> 55:26.416
Yeah, and there was a pretty big, uh…

55:26.500 --> 55:30.666
black vote too, which I think is so great!

55:30.750 --> 55:33.916
And I mean, obviously,
I have no problem with that

55:34.000 --> 55:36.708
as long as everyone has proper ID
with a current street address

55:36.791 --> 55:38.500
and they keep their hands in the air.
Yeah!

55:41.958 --> 55:44.541
[male reporter] Good morning, America.
Election day 2020.

55:44.625 --> 55:46.666
[narrator] The big day arrives,

55:46.750 --> 55:49.750
and as the media frantically promotes
the last election in human history,

55:49.833 --> 55:53.666
early fears of violent clashes
at polling stations melt away

55:53.750 --> 55:58.083
in the face of familiar tedious scenes
of long lines and paperwork.

55:59.291 --> 56:02.875
[male presenter] From MSNBC,
Decision 2020.

56:02.958 --> 56:05.708
[Nerrick] That was when the whole program
suddenly turned

56:05.791 --> 56:08.666
into a really complicated
game show format.

56:08.750 --> 56:10.416
Sort of based on an election.

56:10.500 --> 56:13.208
Basically, they had this map of America

56:13.291 --> 56:15.875
that's blue around the edges
and red in the middle.

56:15.958 --> 56:20.708
And to win the election, the players
have to flip the states over one by one

56:20.791 --> 56:23.083
to see if they're a different color
on the other side.

56:23.166 --> 56:27.125
Election night doesn't begin until we flip
a red state blue or a blue state red.

56:27.208 --> 56:32.000
They're worth different amounts.
Like, Florida is worth 29 points

56:32.083 --> 56:35.500
even though it's got fewer letters
in its name than Tennessee.

56:35.583 --> 56:39.958
It was so confusing, they kept
explaining the rules over and over.

56:40.041 --> 56:43.541
If he does not pull off a Hail Mary pass
and win Wisconsin,

56:43.625 --> 56:46.916
win Michigan or flip any
of those Hilary Clinton states,

56:47.000 --> 56:50.000
then he's gotta go five for five
in these states.

56:50.083 --> 56:53.708
The whole broadcast
was literally days long

56:53.791 --> 56:57.208
and they never seemed to get
to the fun bit where contestants buzz in.

56:57.875 --> 57:00.250
It's the most boring game show ever.

57:01.375 --> 57:04.500
No wonder they only broadcast it
once every four years.

57:05.333 --> 57:08.250
[narrator] As election night ends
without an official victor,

57:08.333 --> 57:11.041
all eyes turn to the crucial state
of Pennsylvania,

57:11.125 --> 57:13.625
where Trump has been on a winning streak.

57:13.708 --> 57:16.708
Until officials stubbornly insist
on counting Biden's votes too.

57:17.458 --> 57:18.916
Trump calls foul.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.083
On live television, he attempts to beat
Nixon's world record

57:22.166 --> 57:23.958
for Presidential bullshit.

57:24.708 --> 57:27.625
We were getting ready
to win this election.

57:27.708 --> 57:30.291
Frankly, we did win this election.

57:30.375 --> 57:31.791
We did win this election.

57:31.875 --> 57:33.416
[cheering]

57:33.500 --> 57:38.416
[narrator] The President demands an end to
democracy and so do some of his followers.

57:39.208 --> 57:40.208
Stop the count!

57:40.291 --> 57:43.583
There appeared to be swathes
of Trump supporters protesting.

57:43.666 --> 57:47.083
But we don't know how many because
they refused to let anyone count them.

57:47.166 --> 57:50.041
Stop the count! Stop the count!

57:50.125 --> 57:52.125
[narrator] With the counting lasting days,

57:52.208 --> 57:54.916
the networks are reluctant
to make an official call.

57:55.000 --> 57:58.333
National fingernail supplies
are chewed dangerously low.

57:59.333 --> 58:02.125
This election was a done deal
on night one.

58:02.208 --> 58:05.833
But it didn't feel like it because
of the way the count was happening.

58:05.916 --> 58:10.250
Pennsylvania and Georgia
were counting mail-in ballots last,

58:10.333 --> 58:12.833
even though those had been
the first to arrive.

58:13.416 --> 58:17.166
So, the narrative that Biden
was slowly inching to the finish line

58:17.250 --> 58:20.250
was really just a story
being told backwards.

58:20.333 --> 58:22.000
When you watch Jaws backwards,

58:22.083 --> 58:25.416
it's the story of a shark that spits
panicking white people into the sea.

58:25.500 --> 58:27.125
Different movie.

58:27.208 --> 58:31.208
[narrator] Finally, as Trump's
hunchbacked lab assistant Rudy Giuliani

58:31.291 --> 58:33.875
addresses the media
from the prestigious car lot

58:33.958 --> 58:35.791
of Four Seasons Total Landscaping,

58:36.458 --> 58:38.291
a call is made.

58:38.375 --> 58:39.916
Who was it called by?

58:40.750 --> 58:44.416
Oh… Oh, my goodness! All the networks!

58:44.500 --> 58:45.916
Wow!

58:47.000 --> 58:48.500
All the networks!

58:51.625 --> 58:54.708
CNN projects Joseph R. Biden Junior

58:54.791 --> 58:58.250
is elected the 46th President
of the United States.

58:58.333 --> 59:01.500
I'll never forget where I was
when I heard Biden had won.

59:01.583 --> 59:04.333
Staring at the news
on a Saturday afternoon

59:04.416 --> 59:06.500
or maybe a Sunday night.

59:06.583 --> 59:08.625
I don't know. The whole week's a blur.

59:08.708 --> 59:11.208
But, oh God, the sheer sense of relief

59:11.291 --> 59:14.125
was like finally taking a dump
after a long flight.

59:14.208 --> 59:19.833
And I mean that in every sense
because I actually had tears in my eyes.

59:19.916 --> 59:23.875
[narrator] In major cities, libtards
and snowflakes mince into the streets

59:23.958 --> 59:25.875
to celebrate Biden's victory

59:25.958 --> 59:29.583
with an outpouring of hope, joy,
and coronaviral droplets.

59:29.666 --> 59:34.500
Well, the last time I witnessed
a celebration on that scale was in 1983

59:34.583 --> 59:37.916
on the forest moon of Endor,
when the Empire was defeated.

59:38.750 --> 59:41.708
[director] Yeah,
that's Return of the Jedi. It's a movie.

59:42.291 --> 59:43.833
A Star Wars, you know.

59:44.666 --> 59:47.583
Well, excuse me, but I was there.

59:47.666 --> 59:51.833
I was there.
Me, and those dear little bear people.

59:51.916 --> 59:53.458
And we had a lovely time.

59:55.541 --> 1:00:00.125
[narrator] As night falls,
President-Elect and keen jogger Joe Biden

1:00:00.208 --> 1:00:01.625
delivers a victory speech.

1:00:01.708 --> 1:00:05.083
After four years of Trump's
inflammatory half sentences,

1:00:05.166 --> 1:00:09.458
progressives draw comfort from Biden's
dull but coherent message of hope.

1:00:10.041 --> 1:00:12.250
I pledge to be a President

1:00:12.333 --> 1:00:15.875
who seeks not to divide but unify.

1:00:17.083 --> 1:00:19.208
[Bracket] Biden's message
was that Americans have

1:00:19.291 --> 1:00:21.583
more that unites us than divides us.

1:00:21.666 --> 1:00:25.000
Even though we were still counting
millions of pieces of paper

1:00:25.083 --> 1:00:27.458
that proved we're completely different.

1:00:27.541 --> 1:00:31.041
And we couldn't even agree
on the outcome of that.

1:00:32.500 --> 1:00:36.500
[Foss] Well, traditionally by now,
the loser would congratulate the victor,

1:00:36.583 --> 1:00:39.458
but Mr. Trump doesn't know
the meaning of the word "concede,"

1:00:39.541 --> 1:00:41.791
and he was furious when they told him.

1:00:41.875 --> 1:00:45.125
[narrator] The President is not alone
in besmirching and be-shitting the result.

1:00:45.208 --> 1:00:47.166
Having just been re-elected to the Senate,

1:00:47.250 --> 1:00:51.666
leading Republicans insist the election
that put them there was rigged.

1:00:51.750 --> 1:00:54.250
There is a lot of shenanigans
going on here.

1:00:54.333 --> 1:00:57.375
If I were President Trump,
I would take all this to court,

1:00:57.458 --> 1:00:58.791
I'd fight back.

1:00:58.875 --> 1:01:02.833
Stop the steal! Stop the steal!
Stop the steal!

1:01:02.916 --> 1:01:04.916
[Flowers] My God.
There were so many discrepancies.

1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:07.333
I mean, listen, according to the records

1:01:07.416 --> 1:01:09.500
there were dead people
who voted for Biden,

1:01:09.583 --> 1:01:12.333
which is impossible
because ghosts cannot hold pencils.

1:01:12.416 --> 1:01:14.708
They said there were
more mail ballots than ever.

1:01:14.791 --> 1:01:17.333
What about female ballots?

1:01:17.416 --> 1:01:21.208
The voting machines in Michigan
were controlled by Hunter Biden's laptop.

1:01:21.291 --> 1:01:22.791
Georgia's not even a real state.

1:01:22.875 --> 1:01:25.833
There's no record of it existing
before November.

1:01:25.916 --> 1:01:29.500
Jet fuel does not burn that hot.
That was a controlled demolition.

1:01:29.583 --> 1:01:32.083
Trump not winning
is a statistical impossibility

1:01:32.166 --> 1:01:34.625
like snow in winter
or a duck that can't talk.

1:01:34.708 --> 1:01:37.041
The lack of evidence proves
there's been a cover-up!

1:01:37.125 --> 1:01:40.083
And the whole election
never even happened.

1:01:40.166 --> 1:01:44.875
CNN made it look like it did
using Deep State CGI.

1:01:46.666 --> 1:01:47.958
It's all a lie.

1:01:49.916 --> 1:01:54.500
And, um… if that's what democracy
looks like, then count me out.

1:01:54.583 --> 1:01:59.625
Actually, don't count me at all
because that would be democracy again.

1:01:59.708 --> 1:02:02.458
And I want no part of it.

1:02:02.541 --> 1:02:05.875
This election is not over, far from it.

1:02:05.958 --> 1:02:08.833
[narrator] In a blizzard of headlines,
Trump launches court challenges

1:02:08.916 --> 1:02:12.916
under the guidance of the legal world's
village idiot, Rudy Giuliani,

1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:15.625
whose efforts prove so hapless
his hair starts crying.

1:02:15.708 --> 1:02:19.083
…and the mail-in ballot process,
in order to cheat.

1:02:19.166 --> 1:02:21.000
[narrator] But the efforts
come to nothing.

1:02:21.500 --> 1:02:25.875
[Dr. Gravel] The one good thing
about Trump refusing to concede

1:02:25.958 --> 1:02:29.708
was that we got to watch him lose
over and over.

1:02:30.333 --> 1:02:32.250
All those doomed legal efforts?

1:02:32.333 --> 1:02:36.250
It was like watching a man
fall from a skyscraper

1:02:36.333 --> 1:02:40.125
trying to sue the sidewalk
out of existence before he hit the ground.

1:02:40.208 --> 1:02:43.708
[Grace] The media will deny this,
but Trump did not lose the election.

1:02:43.791 --> 1:02:45.458
[director] Have you got any proof of that?

1:02:45.541 --> 1:02:48.416
He won the popular vote
by a margin of literally millions.

1:02:48.500 --> 1:02:51.375
What more evidence do you need?
He won fair and square.

1:02:51.458 --> 1:02:54.375
Right, so you're claiming Trump
won the popular vote?

1:02:54.458 --> 1:02:58.583
No, Biden did. President-Elect Biden.
The victor. [chuckles]

1:02:58.666 --> 1:03:00.416
[director] Right. Don't you support Trump?

1:03:00.500 --> 1:03:02.458
I have never supported Trump.

1:03:02.541 --> 1:03:03.750
Check your tape, Bob.

1:03:04.416 --> 1:03:06.916
[director] It's James,
and you were part of Trump's campaign.

1:03:07.000 --> 1:03:08.166
Who's Trump?

1:03:08.666 --> 1:03:10.916
[narrator] Trump himself
may have been voted out,

1:03:11.000 --> 1:03:13.125
but the movement behind him persists.

1:03:13.208 --> 1:03:17.791
America remains trapped
in a loveless marriage with itself.

1:03:17.875 --> 1:03:19.833
[Bracket] It is astounding

1:03:19.916 --> 1:03:24.208
that despite everything he did
over the past four years,

1:03:24.291 --> 1:03:28.375
over 70 million Americans
were absolutely rooting for Trump.

1:03:28.458 --> 1:03:32.375
We will never give in, we will never
give up, and we will never back down.

1:03:32.458 --> 1:03:35.083
We will never ever surrender.

1:03:35.166 --> 1:03:36.708
[cheering]

1:03:36.791 --> 1:03:38.500
[Bracket] It's either terrifying

1:03:39.250 --> 1:03:42.041
or the most inspiring love story
of our age.

1:03:44.458 --> 1:03:47.750
[Foss] People think of democracy
as permanent and unchanging.

1:03:48.333 --> 1:03:51.916
In truth, it's something
you must perpetually nurture,

1:03:52.000 --> 1:03:54.375
like a woman or a professional grudge.

1:03:55.416 --> 1:03:58.166
American democracy has survived
this challenge.

1:03:58.250 --> 1:04:03.000
But what will happen in a few years' time
when the next Trump comes along?

1:04:03.083 --> 1:04:06.833
Perhaps a younger, more cunning,
more ruthless Trump.

1:04:06.916 --> 1:04:10.875
With faster reflexes
and a titanium exoskeleton.

1:04:10.958 --> 1:04:12.791
Venom sacs on his neck.

1:04:12.875 --> 1:04:15.208
Maybe some kind of fearsome onyx claw.

1:04:15.291 --> 1:04:16.708
What happens then?

1:04:17.958 --> 1:04:20.500
[Goolies] The thing is
once Trump finally leaves,

1:04:20.583 --> 1:04:24.500
America will be back to being
totally non-racist, overnight.

1:04:24.583 --> 1:04:29.083
And we can just chill about that whole
institutional, you know… whatever deal.

1:04:29.958 --> 1:04:32.333
I shall be sad to see Mr. Trump go

1:04:32.416 --> 1:04:36.083
because he brought
such quiet dignity to his role.

1:04:36.875 --> 1:04:38.583
But that said,

1:04:38.666 --> 1:04:40.875
I do look forward to welcoming Mr. Biden

1:04:40.958 --> 1:04:43.666
to Buckingham Palace
at the earliest opportunity.

1:04:44.166 --> 1:04:45.666
Indeed we have met before,

1:04:45.750 --> 1:04:48.500
at my coronation in 1953,

1:04:48.583 --> 1:04:50.500
which he attended as an old man.

1:04:50.583 --> 1:04:54.750
[narrator] As America begins a new chapter
and 2020 shudders to a close,

1:04:54.833 --> 1:04:57.875
the global pandemic
is sadly still in full swing.

1:04:57.958 --> 1:05:00.791
Yet even as it tightens its grip
once more,

1:05:00.875 --> 1:05:03.416
glimmers of hope appear at last.

1:05:04.416 --> 1:05:07.500
Good news at last on Covid-19,

1:05:07.583 --> 1:05:10.291
a vaccine could be available by Christmas.

1:05:11.250 --> 1:05:14.208
Well, this was
a historic scientific achievement,

1:05:14.291 --> 1:05:16.750
on a par with the moon landings.

1:05:16.833 --> 1:05:21.416
But more difficult because the coronavirus
is far smaller than the moon.

1:05:21.500 --> 1:05:23.958
The vaccine breakthroughs are good news.

1:05:24.041 --> 1:05:26.166
But there is still a lot of work to do.

1:05:26.916 --> 1:05:28.541
Once approval has been met

1:05:28.625 --> 1:05:30.708
and manufacture scaled up,

1:05:30.791 --> 1:05:33.916
it must be distributed
at sub-zero temperatures,

1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:38.708
and the slightest transport setback
could generate a huge amount of waste.

1:05:39.541 --> 1:05:41.541
What is wrong with you people?

1:05:42.041 --> 1:05:44.333
[narrator] Even with a miracle cure,

1:05:44.416 --> 1:05:47.500
there's no guarantee
everyone will embrace the vaccine.

1:05:47.583 --> 1:05:51.916
No 5G vaccine for me, thank you very much.
It's made in a laboratory.

1:05:52.000 --> 1:05:55.458
And you shouldn't trust
anything that's not natural.

1:05:55.541 --> 1:05:57.500
I read about it on Facebook.

1:05:57.583 --> 1:06:00.208
[director] Well, Facebook isn't
exactly natural either.

1:06:00.291 --> 1:06:03.958
Well, I don't inject Facebook
into my veins. Yeah. [laughs]

1:06:05.208 --> 1:06:07.958
[director] But you're happy
to absorb it into your mind?

1:06:10.208 --> 1:06:11.416
Get out of my house!

1:06:11.500 --> 1:06:13.833
[narrator] Despite naysayers
and refuseniks,

1:06:13.916 --> 1:06:16.541
vaccines offer a chance
of a more normal life

1:06:16.625 --> 1:06:19.083
in 2021 and beyond.

1:06:20.083 --> 1:06:23.125
It's exciting to think
we could have our lives back soon.

1:06:24.125 --> 1:06:26.416
You know, we could go to the pub.

1:06:27.458 --> 1:06:30.708
Maybe meet someone
and have a bit of a dance.

1:06:31.791 --> 1:06:33.166
Bit of a fumble.

1:06:34.083 --> 1:06:35.625
Move in together.

1:06:37.750 --> 1:06:38.958
Drift apart.

1:06:40.125 --> 1:06:42.958
Learn to hate the way
they pick their teeth.

1:06:45.375 --> 1:06:46.958
The sound of their voice.

1:06:48.458 --> 1:06:49.958
Wish you'd never met.

1:06:51.083 --> 1:06:53.333
Like, seriously rue the day.

1:06:58.166 --> 1:06:59.916
Is the vaccine compulsory?

1:07:00.750 --> 1:07:03.875
[narrator] 2020 challenged humanity
on a scale like no other.

1:07:03.958 --> 1:07:07.416
A year of tumult, upheaval, outrage,

1:07:07.500 --> 1:07:10.458
insult, disaster, lava, and division.

1:07:10.541 --> 1:07:13.500
It tested us, but maybe it taught us too.

1:07:14.291 --> 1:07:16.333
[director] What did you learn in 2020?

1:07:16.416 --> 1:07:17.583
What did I learn?

1:07:18.166 --> 1:07:19.375
Huh.

1:07:19.458 --> 1:07:23.791
Uh… how many steps there are
between my couch and the refrigerator.

1:07:23.875 --> 1:07:27.750
I learned the complete genomic sequence
of the novel coronavirus.

1:07:28.833 --> 1:07:30.250
And how to do the Floss.

1:07:35.000 --> 1:07:37.333
I've learned a lot about myself.

1:07:37.416 --> 1:07:41.625
That sometimes I'm too much
of a giving person.

1:07:41.708 --> 1:07:47.458
And, um… Oh, I've also learned
how to correctly pronounce Sieg Heil!

1:07:47.541 --> 1:07:52.708
Well, I would say, personally,
2020 was rather fun, looking back.

1:07:52.791 --> 1:07:55.125
I got in touch
with some old university chums

1:07:55.208 --> 1:07:58.500
and we have started
a Zoom barbershop quartet.

1:07:59.708 --> 1:08:04.500
-Would you like to hear my Camptown Races?
-[director] Um… I… No. No.

1:08:07.708 --> 1:08:11.041
-[director] That was so good. Thank you.
-Oh, thank you.

1:08:11.125 --> 1:08:12.375
Great, awesome.

1:08:12.458 --> 1:08:15.041
-Are we done, is that it?
-[director] It was brilliant. Thank you.

1:08:15.125 --> 1:08:18.583
Listen, uh, it looks like we might
be doing one of these again next year

1:08:18.666 --> 1:08:20.708
-for the end of 2021.
-Mm-hmm.

1:08:20.791 --> 1:08:21.833
Mm-hmm.

1:08:21.916 --> 1:08:23.708
-Right.
-Yeah.

1:08:23.791 --> 1:08:26.833
[director] Is there any chance
you could read some advance responses now

1:08:26.916 --> 1:08:31.083
so we can cut them into the edit later?
They're on that piece of paper.

1:08:31.166 --> 1:08:32.333
Uh…

1:08:32.416 --> 1:08:34.875
Yes. Yes, happy to oblige.

1:08:36.083 --> 1:08:37.500
OK.

1:08:37.583 --> 1:08:40.250
-Yeah, just this last page?
-[director] Yeah.

1:08:40.333 --> 1:08:42.750
But no one could have foreseen

1:08:42.833 --> 1:08:45.125
what the vaccine would do to us

1:08:45.208 --> 1:08:47.958
or how we'd use our new powers.

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.625
But no one could have foreseen
what the vaccine would do to us

1:08:51.708 --> 1:08:53.791
or how we'd use our new powers.

1:08:54.458 --> 1:08:57.291
But no one could have foreseen
what the vaccine would do to us

1:08:57.375 --> 1:08:59.250
or how we'd use our new powers.

1:08:59.333 --> 1:09:02.833
And that, of course, is when
President Harris unveiled her real agenda.

1:09:02.916 --> 1:09:06.958
And that was when President Harris
unveiled her real agenda.

1:09:07.041 --> 1:09:11.500
And that was when President Harris
unveiled her real agenda.

1:09:11.583 --> 1:09:17.125
Of course, in the end, the Trump News
Network came off air after just one month.

1:09:17.208 --> 1:09:21.541
Of course, in the end, the Trump News
Network came off air after just a month.

1:09:21.625 --> 1:09:24.875
I've gotta say he was the last
world leader you'd expect to see

1:09:24.958 --> 1:09:29.541
pushing a hardboiled egg
up his own ass on Italian television.

1:09:29.625 --> 1:09:32.333
Gotta say he was the last world leader
you'd expect to see

1:09:32.416 --> 1:09:35.333
pushing a hardboiled egg
up his own ass on Italian television.

1:09:35.416 --> 1:09:38.666
Gotta say he was the last world leader
you'd expect to see

1:09:38.750 --> 1:09:42.500
pushing a hardboiled egg
up his own ass on Italian television.

1:09:42.583 --> 1:09:45.958
But then, at the last moment,
we all woke up

1:09:46.041 --> 1:09:48.041
and it had all been a horrible dream.

1:09:48.125 --> 1:09:51.000
But then, at the last moment,
we all woke up

1:09:51.083 --> 1:09:54.500
and it had all been a horrible dream!

1:09:54.583 --> 1:09:56.666
But then, at the last moment,
we all woke up

1:09:56.750 --> 1:09:59.041
and it was all a horrible dream.

1:09:59.125 --> 1:10:00.250
Oh, I wish.

1:10:00.333 --> 1:10:03.000
Is that enough, will that do? Terrific.

1:10:03.083 --> 1:10:04.916
Great, thank you.

1:10:05.666 --> 1:10:06.666
OK.

1:10:06.750 --> 1:10:09.000
Well, guys, it has been great.

1:10:09.666 --> 1:10:11.166
Anyway, I have a train,

1:10:11.916 --> 1:10:16.916
and prior to train I am going
to find myself a semi-louche bar

1:10:17.000 --> 1:10:19.125
and a welcoming Negroni.

1:10:20.041 --> 1:10:21.583
[Flowers] Um… is that enough?

1:10:22.208 --> 1:10:26.291
OK, this was fun! I had fun.

1:10:26.958 --> 1:10:28.416
Alright, we done here?

1:10:28.500 --> 1:10:29.833
Mmm!

1:10:29.916 --> 1:10:31.875
I'm done here, you? Huh?

1:10:32.833 --> 1:10:34.083
You wanna have sex?

1:10:35.250 --> 1:10:36.583
[director] Um…

1:10:36.666 --> 1:10:40.500
Well… there's quite a strict social
distancing policy on this production…

1:10:40.583 --> 1:10:41.750
Suit yourself, man.

1:10:41.833 --> 1:10:43.041
[director] Uh…
