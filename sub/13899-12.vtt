00:06.000 --> 00:07.340
[Nikki] I'm really glad
that we could do this

00:07.380 --> 00:09.260
while I was in
town for the conference.

00:10.210 --> 00:11.880
Coffee was nice.

00:13.090 --> 00:14.890
It's good. It's
great to see you.

00:16.510 --> 00:19.310
And it was so cool you to get
us a table at Mallard Cottage.

00:19.350 --> 00:22.020
That was so great. Because
David, he tried and tried.

00:22.060 --> 00:23.600
But he couldn't get us
a reservation.

00:23.640 --> 00:24.150
So...

00:25.190 --> 00:26.810
It's a busy spot.
It's brand new.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.770
buddy.
So it wasn't that hard.

00:28.820 --> 00:30.230
Well it was cool.

00:30.280 --> 00:34.490
What's it like being a mother?
It suits you, it seems.

00:34.530 --> 00:37.780
It's great. I love it.

00:37.830 --> 00:39.490
Obviously.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.330
So...
Are you and Leslie...

00:43.000 --> 00:45.170
Please. Like I said, Ok. I just
don't want to talk about Leslie.

00:45.210 --> 00:46.460
I've told you that a
hundred times today.

00:46.500 --> 00:51.130
Fine. I just want you to
be happy. That's all.

00:51.170 --> 00:52.130
I...

00:53.010 --> 00:54.090
I am.

00:54.130 --> 00:55.550
I'm serious, Jake.

00:55.590 --> 00:57.260
I'm happy.

00:57.300 --> 00:58.930
Wait a second. Are you mad at me

00:58.970 --> 01:00.560
because I'm happy
and you aren't?

01:00.600 --> 01:02.220
Because I can so feel that
coming from you.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.350
Oh my God. What are
you even talking about?

01:04.390 --> 01:05.440
I'm serious. Getting
the table at

01:05.480 --> 01:06.690
the restaurant when
David couldn't.

01:06.730 --> 01:08.900
Inviting me for coffee.

01:08.940 --> 01:10.570
Nikki, you moved away.

01:10.610 --> 01:12.570
Okay, you just had a kid.
You came back for a visit.

01:12.610 --> 01:14.780
I wanted to hang out.
Is that so wrong?

01:14.820 --> 01:15.740
Are you sure about that?

01:15.780 --> 01:17.410
We used to be married, okay.

01:18.490 --> 01:22.290
And listen.
Just do not freak out.

01:22.330 --> 01:24.200
But I think someone's
following us.

01:24.250 --> 01:26.540
There's been a black caddy on
our tail for a while now.

01:26.580 --> 01:27.710
A what?

01:27.750 --> 01:28.670
A caddy.

01:28.710 --> 01:29.630
Nikki!

01:29.670 --> 01:30.550

01:38.260 --> 01:39.600

01:49.230 --> 01:50.650
Wait here.

02:01.450 --> 02:02.290

02:05.960 --> 02:06.830
Wow.

02:08.460 --> 02:09.380
Call the police.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.330
Behind you!

02:10.380 --> 02:11.250
[crunch]

02:13.420 --> 02:15.420
I'm calling the police!

02:20.850 --> 02:21.890
No, no, no.

02:23.810 --> 02:26.180
Give it to me.

02:27.730 --> 02:29.310
Good girl.

02:31.860 --> 02:34.270
That looked bad.
You guys...

02:34.320 --> 02:36.900
I'm a doctor.
So I could help you.

02:38.150 --> 02:41.660
I'll keep that in
mind. Thanks.

02:42.160 --> 02:43.030

you might wanna make some
changes to the sport.

03:40.170 --> 03:42.010
This was a little
excessive, no?

03:42.050 --> 03:43.550
When I saw him last--

03:43.590 --> 03:45.300
His nose wasn't busted.

03:45.350 --> 03:46.350
Yeah, well there's
easier ways to

03:46.390 --> 03:47.890
try to get a fella's attention--

03:47.930 --> 03:50.560
than to try and run him and
his lady friend off the road.

03:50.600 --> 03:52.940
My name is Andre Besson. Does

03:52.980 --> 03:54.810
that sound familiar
to you, Jake?

03:57.610 --> 03:58.440
Should it?

Remember your little
fishing trip?

04:07.030 --> 04:09.290
Ah, now it rings the bell.

04:10.750 --> 04:11.750
Good.

04:11.790 --> 04:13.540
I don't actually owe
you any money, I

04:13.580 --> 04:15.000
mean I didn't steal
it from you, so.

04:15.040 --> 04:15.960
No.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.500
But the police have it.

04:17.540 --> 04:21.720
Yes and as I recall you're
the reason why they have it

04:21.760 --> 04:22.800
And I do not.

04:23.720 --> 04:25.800
Which puts you in my debt.

04:25.840 --> 04:30.640
And Jake. Please note. In my
debt is a terrible place to be.

04:32.100 --> 04:34.900
I don't know what you've
heard, but the P.I. business--

04:34.940 --> 04:36.810
It really isn't that
lucrative.

Ah!

04:37.820 --> 04:39.230
Ferme ta guelue, Doyle.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.490
I need a valuable item
returned to me.

04:48.530 --> 04:51.200
A red metal tool box.

04:51.250 --> 04:53.080
You find it, and
bring it here.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.330
What's in the box?

04:57.040 --> 04:58.250
It's none of my business.

04:58.290 --> 05:00.800
Okay. Well, do I get a
lead, at least?

05:00.840 --> 05:03.590
Yes. As a matter of fact.

05:06.010 --> 05:07.680
Oscar Noonan.

05:08.350 --> 05:09.350
Oscan Noonan.

05:09.390 --> 05:11.260
He has it.

05:11.310 --> 05:15.390
Bring him and the box back
here. We'll call it even.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.350
And if I don't?

05:17.900 --> 05:20.980
You will be covering the debt
you owe me with your life.

05:22.820 --> 05:25.360
[Jake] Des, I need you
to find Oscar Noonan.

05:25.400 --> 05:26.820
He's got quite the rap sheet.

05:26.860 --> 05:28.740
Yeah. It's obvious he's tied
up with the mob.

05:28.780 --> 05:30.450
Do you think they're gonna
give him the Colombian Necktie?

05:30.490 --> 05:31.790
Jake that's in the mob--

05:31.830 --> 05:33.160
They take your tongue.
And then they--

05:33.200 --> 05:35.000
Des. I don't know what they're
going to do to him.

05:35.040 --> 05:36.330
Which doesn't make me
feel great.

05:36.370 --> 05:37.670
It doesn't make me feel
great either.

05:37.710 --> 05:38.830
I'll find him first.

05:38.880 --> 05:40.210
And then I'll figure out
what I'm gonna do.

05:40.250 --> 05:41.710
He's got petty theft.

05:41.750 --> 05:45.090
A loitering charge.
And weird.

05:45.130 --> 05:46.630
Multiple arrests for dice.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.970
Dice?

05:48.010 --> 05:49.680
Yeah. For running illegal
street dice games.

05:49.720 --> 05:51.260
Although I suppose
there'd be no street

05:51.300 --> 05:52.140
dice games that
were legal, hey b'y.

05:52.180 --> 05:53.560

05:53.600 --> 05:56.350
What are you. Are you making
kissy noises right now?

05:56.390 --> 06:01.690
I'm not. I was stopping a
sneeze. I don't know.

06:01.730 --> 06:03.400
Okay. If he's into dice,
I think I got

06:03.440 --> 06:05.150
a couple of places
I can check out.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.110
I'll call you later.

06:06.150 --> 06:07.700
Okay.

06:07.740 --> 06:08.820
Chill.

06:08.860 --> 06:10.030
He can't see you.

06:10.070 --> 06:11.620
Are you sure?
'Cause sometimes I wonder.

06:11.660 --> 06:12.700
Are you still bummed about
losing the apartment?

06:12.740 --> 06:14.330
Yeah.

06:14.370 --> 06:17.410
I mean, I like living here. But
I just feel like I'm in the way.

06:17.460 --> 06:18.750
Yeah. It would be nice to
have a place to hang

06:18.790 --> 06:20.210
out without the fear
of Jake killing you.

06:20.250 --> 06:21.420
Exactly.

06:21.460 --> 06:23.670
So... Maybe it's time
that we tell him.

06:23.710 --> 06:25.210
No, it's not.

06:25.260 --> 06:29.430
Definitely not. Or maybe
I could talk to Mal.

06:29.470 --> 06:31.220
He'll have my back.
And Jake would never

06:31.260 --> 06:33.220
expect such a
diabolical alliance.

06:33.260 --> 06:34.180
in his own tribe.

06:34.220 --> 06:35.930

06:37.390 --> 06:38.310
Get outta here.

cheese, you got cheese.

It's a lot of money to be
made here, right?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.200
The jackpot is getting huge.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

06:55.240 --> 06:56.910
Alright, who's the
hot here? Is it you?

06:56.950 --> 06:58.040
Let's go.
Come on boys.

06:58.080 --> 07:00.040
Come on! Oh, that is--

07:00.080 --> 07:01.170
so close to being
a winner.

07:01.210 --> 07:02.580
But unfortunately,

07:02.630 --> 07:05.340
it is not. But I really
encourage you to play again.

07:05.380 --> 07:05.760
Hey, hey.

07:06.880 --> 07:08.260
Losing streaks.
They happen, right?

07:08.300 --> 07:09.300
They happen
to everybody.

07:09.340 --> 07:11.720
It happened to me.
But the thing is,

07:11.760 --> 07:13.220
the only way to
break one-- Is to

07:13.260 --> 07:15.510
stick it out. All the good
players know that.

07:15.560 --> 07:16.470
You gotta think long term,

07:16.520 --> 07:19.190
right? Yeah.

07:20.440 --> 07:21.770
That's the spirit.

07:26.610 --> 07:27.530
Give me that.

07:27.570 --> 07:29.070
Hey, Chachi.

07:29.110 --> 07:31.410

That was very impressive.

07:51.880 --> 07:53.510
been looking all over for you.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.970
you've been running
from me for days.

Oh this? This is my, uh--
It's not worth anything.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.650
You owe me a lot of money.

08:11.700 --> 08:13.200
That's why I'm working
a job, okay? Just

08:13.240 --> 08:14.780
let me finish it up.
And you can get

08:14.820 --> 08:16.990
paid. And remember that
none of that--

08:17.030 --> 08:19.370
Me paying you, is possible,
if you kill me.

08:19.410 --> 08:20.290
Oscar.

08:20.330 --> 08:21.700
Payment?

08:21.750 --> 08:25.170

now. I have to cut my

08:25.210 --> 08:26.420
losses and make an
example of out of you.

08:31.590 --> 08:33.010
I'm not a cop.

08:33.050 --> 08:33.970
He's a lying cop.

08:34.010 --> 08:36.100
I am not--

08:36.140 --> 08:38.470
A cop.

08:38.510 --> 08:42.850
I need a moment alone with
Oscar before you do--

08:42.890 --> 08:44.980
whatever it is you're planning
to do to him.

08:45.020 --> 08:47.560
Yeah? Or I could just bash

08:47.610 --> 08:49.320
both of your brains in.

08:51.860 --> 08:53.030

08:55.200 --> 08:57.740

08:57.780 --> 08:59.740

the toolbox there.

08:59.790 --> 09:00.700
Could you...?

09:03.250 --> 09:04.750
You're sitting on...

09:04.790 --> 09:07.380
Oscar! Stop right there.

09:07.420 --> 09:08.670
Or I'll shoot you in the face.

09:08.710 --> 09:11.000
Okay. Okay. Okay.
You got me.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.010

of that Belarus Triangle?

09:13.050 --> 09:14.430

God, I didn't know

talking about?

09:32.360 --> 09:35.910
Look. Harley is the least of
your problems, trust me.

09:38.990 --> 09:41.450
She has something that is
very important

09:41.490 --> 09:43.120

09:43.160 --> 09:45.790
Come on. Now.

09:56.260 --> 09:57.260

my computer.

it upstairs. I'm just--

10:02.890 --> 10:04.680
checking my emails.

10:04.720 --> 10:07.850
Well, feel free to use my
office, if you like.

10:07.890 --> 10:09.560
You can have a bit more
privacy at least.

10:09.610 --> 10:10.520
Thanks Bennett.

10:10.560 --> 10:11.570
All done.

10:17.740 --> 10:19.410

10:20.070 --> 10:21.950
Yeah. Find Doyle.

10:23.120 --> 10:24.500
I don't remember leaving
my email open.

10:25.580 --> 10:27.040
Unless you were using
my computer.

10:27.080 --> 10:31.500
No. I was just walking by.
Don't let me keep you.

10:39.800 --> 10:40.930
Can I help you sergeant?

10:40.970 --> 10:42.390
No, I'm good.

10:43.640 --> 10:45.810
Then go earn some money.
Catch some bad guys.

10:55.610 --> 10:56.030
Rose?

10:57.490 --> 10:59.860
What's going on? When you're
quiet, I get worried.

10:59.910 --> 11:00.950
[camera click]

11:00.990 --> 11:02.030
Oh, sorry Malachy.

11:02.070 --> 11:03.370
I'm just taking photos.

11:03.410 --> 11:04.330
[Andre]
Where is he?

11:04.830 --> 11:05.950
[clicking]

11:06.870 --> 11:08.410
Andre's on some sort of meet.

11:08.460 --> 11:09.960
[Mal] Look, you
know. I'm fine now.

11:10.000 --> 11:11.080
I might as well come
back to work.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.040
Malachy Doyle, you stay put.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.210
Or I'll call the nurses and tell

11:14.250 --> 11:15.420
them you're threatening
to go AWOL.

11:15.460 --> 11:16.960
Andre Besson

11:17.000 --> 11:18.970
is a dangerous guy. You can't
blame me for being worried.

11:19.010 --> 11:20.760
Just give me a play by play.

11:20.800 --> 11:22.260
Okay. They're looking
in the back of a van.

11:23.260 --> 11:24.760
I'm trying to see
what's inside.

11:26.350 --> 11:27.220
Hey!

11:28.680 --> 11:30.100
Don't you screw this
up for me!

11:30.140 --> 11:30.940
[Mal] Can you see what's in it?

11:30.980 --> 11:32.270
Guns or televisions,

11:32.310 --> 11:33.190
or all the guys they
had killed this week so far?

11:34.770 --> 11:37.690
[Rose] There are no corpses that
I can see. It looks like...

11:38.240 --> 11:39.360
Electronics?

11:40.110 --> 11:40.700
Maybe medical equipment.

11:41.820 --> 11:43.320
Hey I gotta go.
I'll call you later.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.950
Just be careful, okay.

11:44.990 --> 11:45.990
Okay. Love you.

11:48.370 --> 11:49.410
[Jake] Who was the missus
that I just electrocuted?

11:50.540 --> 11:54.590
Harley Denief. We are...
work colleagues.

11:54.630 --> 11:56.290
She's your bookie.

11:56.340 --> 11:57.750
How much do you owe her?

11:57.800 --> 12:00.260
Doesn't really matter now,
does it? Uh...

12:00.300 --> 12:01.510
Jake.

12:01.550 --> 12:03.680
That's a great name.
Strong, you know?

12:03.720 --> 12:05.470
It says everything
when you hear it.

12:05.510 --> 12:06.560
Jake.

12:06.600 --> 12:07.600
Jake.

12:07.640 --> 12:08.560
Jake.

12:08.600 --> 12:09.770
Stop it.

12:09.810 --> 12:11.100
Tell me about the tool box.

12:11.140 --> 12:14.230
Tool box. Tool box.
Can you be more specific?

12:14.770 --> 12:15.690
Ow. Ow.

12:15.730 --> 12:17.150
Toolbox.

12:17.190 --> 12:20.030
It's a box. Made of metal
that usually contains tools.

12:20.070 --> 12:21.490
Not unlike you.

12:21.530 --> 12:23.200
Now, what's in this
particularly tool box?

12:23.240 --> 12:25.370
I couldn't open. You know,
I'm good at a lot of things.

12:25.410 --> 12:26.910
but picking locks is not
one of those things.

12:27.410 --> 12:28.540
[bang]

12:28.580 --> 12:29.660
Knock it off, okay!

12:29.700 --> 12:30.910
Andre Besson

12:30.950 --> 12:33.250
and the Montreal Mob are
looking for that box.

12:33.290 --> 12:34.370
And you,
I'm assuming.

12:34.420 --> 12:35.920
Now what do you make of that?

12:35.960 --> 12:39.050
Ok. I'm going to level with you
because you saved my life.

12:39.090 --> 12:43.340
I'm a made man. Fully mobbed
up. I'm what you call a--

12:43.380 --> 12:44.470
capellini.

12:45.760 --> 12:47.550
That's a type of pasta.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.100
Okay. So, some dude
just called me and

12:50.140 --> 12:52.600
asked me to do a job.
The money was right.

12:52.640 --> 12:54.770
And all I had to do was deliver
this toolbox some place.

12:54.810 --> 12:56.270
When was this?

12:56.310 --> 12:59.480
Yesterday, the day before.
I got a lot on the go right now.

12:59.520 --> 13:01.400
Ok, I'm a really busy guy.

13:01.440 --> 13:02.360
[bang]

13:02.400 --> 13:03.320
Ow!

13:03.360 --> 13:04.700
Will you stop doing that?

13:04.740 --> 13:06.110
Listen, do you
think that I wanna

13:06.160 --> 13:07.620
be involved in
any of this?

13:07.660 --> 13:10.030
Because I don't. Trust me.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.790
So let's just find
the toolbox. Give

13:11.830 --> 13:13.500
it back to Don
Corleone. And then--

13:13.540 --> 13:15.370
You can live the
rest of your life in

13:15.420 --> 13:17.250
freedom from running
from the mob.

13:17.290 --> 13:18.170
Capisce?

13:19.630 --> 13:21.420
[ring]

13:21.460 --> 13:22.670
Hi.

13:22.710 --> 13:24.220
The cube van belongs to
a delivery service,

13:24.260 --> 13:25.930
and it was schedule for a drop
off at that location today.

13:25.970 --> 13:27.430
Was it supposed to be carrying
medical supplies?

13:27.470 --> 13:29.810
Yeah. The cargo
manifest accounts for it.

13:29.850 --> 13:30.890
Who owns the merchandise?

13:30.930 --> 13:32.600
A holding company
registered to--

13:32.640 --> 13:33.980
Andre Besson.

13:34.020 --> 13:36.150
Okay. He owns it. It's legit.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.230
Yeah.

13:37.270 --> 13:38.810
He owns a chain of
bowling alleys.

13:38.860 --> 13:39.980
The one here is the largest
east of Montreal.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.270
Listen, Tinny.

13:41.320 --> 13:42.940
Please. Do not tell your
grandfather I asked you

13:42.990 --> 13:43.030
for your help.

13:44.190 --> 13:45.490
You know how he
gets about dragging

13:45.530 --> 13:46.910
you into this kind of stuff.

13:46.950 --> 13:48.780
Yeah. I know.
See ya, Rose.

13:48.820 --> 13:50.370
Okay. Bye.

13:50.410 --> 13:51.660
[Oscar]
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

13:51.700 --> 13:52.950
What are you doing, man?

13:52.990 --> 13:54.290
You know she wants to
kill me, right?

13:54.330 --> 13:56.080
She's not gonna be very
dangerous without this.

13:56.120 --> 13:57.460
[crash]

13:58.790 --> 13:59.710
No. No no.

13:59.750 --> 14:00.670
No, no, no.

14:00.710 --> 14:01.630
Hey wait.

14:01.670 --> 14:02.550
Hold on, okay?

14:03.800 --> 14:04.710
[crash]

14:04.760 --> 14:05.800
You think I'm joking, Oscar?

14:05.840 --> 14:06.720
No.

14:23.400 --> 14:25.690
Okay. Here. I'm choking.

14:25.740 --> 14:27.950
Wow. Really? I hadn't noticed.

14:27.990 --> 14:28.860
[punch]

14:32.330 --> 14:33.370
Oh. Ow.

14:36.210 --> 14:37.040
What?

14:37.080 --> 14:38.120
As evidence.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.290
Because you're
perverted, that's why.

14:40.330 --> 14:42.170
[punch]

14:43.210 --> 14:44.130
[Jake]
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

14:44.170 --> 14:45.300
Take it easy there.

14:45.340 --> 14:46.090
Why didn't you do this first,?

14:46.130 --> 14:47.470
And then go get the box?

14:47.510 --> 14:49.880
Because I didn't want Harley
here to feel cheated.

14:49.930 --> 14:53.430
Harley. You got the pictures
of his broken face.

14:53.470 --> 14:55.680
That's gonna have to be the
example that you wanted to set.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.640
It's not what I had in mind.

14:57.680 --> 14:59.140
Well, it'll have to do.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.400
And your lucky you're
getting off that easy

15:00.440 --> 15:02.730
after what you did to
my window.

15:02.770 --> 15:03.770
So let's just let --

15:03.820 --> 15:06.650
bygones be...whatever.

15:06.690 --> 15:08.150
Not a chance.

15:08.190 --> 15:10.780
Leave us alone, don't follow us.

15:10.820 --> 15:13.780
Oscar here will pay you
back in seven days.

15:13.830 --> 15:15.450
Seven working days.

15:15.490 --> 15:16.450
Shut up.

15:16.490 --> 15:17.450
[Harley]
You just made

15:17.500 --> 15:18.700
an enemy
out of me, Jake Doyle.

15:18.750 --> 15:21.540
Yeah, well, there's a
fraternity full of ye.

15:21.580 --> 15:23.750
Welcome to the club.

15:26.050 --> 15:26.920
Bye bye.

15:29.550 --> 15:31.390
You let her beat the hell
out of me, man.

15:31.430 --> 15:32.510
[ring]

15:32.550 --> 15:34.600
How else are you
supposed to learn?

15:36.680 --> 15:38.230
Why are you not answering your
girlfriend's calls?

15:38.270 --> 15:39.680
She's my ex-wife.

15:39.730 --> 15:40.980
Whatever.
I don't care man, okay.

15:41.020 --> 15:42.100
We got the toolbox.

15:42.150 --> 15:43.730
What are we doing now?

15:43.770 --> 15:46.150
I'm gonna call Andre. Find out
where we're supposed to meet.

15:46.190 --> 15:49.950
And if your lucky, you'll get
out of this alive. Now...

15:49.990 --> 15:53.410
Put 'em on.

15:53.450 --> 15:54.910
Put them on.

15:57.580 --> 15:58.830
[Des]
Do you have any ...

15:58.870 --> 15:59.790
eights?

15:59.830 --> 16:02.370
Des. We're playing poker.

16:02.420 --> 16:03.330
Then I fold.

16:03.380 --> 16:04.290
Well played, sir.

16:04.330 --> 16:05.590
Are you okay?

16:05.630 --> 16:07.340
Yeah, I'm fine.

16:07.380 --> 16:08.960
You want to talk about it?

16:09.010 --> 16:10.840
Something on your mind?

16:10.880 --> 16:14.720
Aside from gangsters trying
to kill us all? No.

16:14.760 --> 16:16.510
Is it just me,
or have you been

16:16.550 --> 16:18.270
spending a lot time with
Tinny lately?

16:20.810 --> 16:22.440
What? What?

16:22.480 --> 16:25.110
Because if it's what I think
it is, I want you to know

16:25.150 --> 16:26.440
I'm okay with it.

16:26.480 --> 16:30.650
Oh. I mean, oh.

16:30.690 --> 16:32.450
I almost died, Des.

16:32.490 --> 16:34.780
Take it from me--

16:34.820 --> 16:36.570
Life is short. You need
to enjoy every

16:36.620 --> 16:39.200
second of it with
the people you love--

16:39.240 --> 16:40.160
Mal, uh.

16:40.200 --> 16:41.450
You're a good boy.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.750
You love my granddaughter.

16:43.790 --> 16:44.670
I do?

16:45.210 --> 16:47.250
I do! I do!

16:47.290 --> 16:50.760
So. Remember that.
I trust you.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.050
Pick 'em up.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.430
Should I tell Jake,
do you think?

16:57.470 --> 17:00.010
No. But I hate to say this.
If you're dating

17:00.060 --> 17:02.930
Tinny, you need to move
out of my house today.

17:02.980 --> 17:04.440
But I just lost my apartment.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.440
Don't care. Move in with Jake.

17:06.480 --> 17:08.820
I can't have you under
the same roof. The end.

17:17.530 --> 17:20.450
Alright Oscar, look.
I like ya, okay?

17:20.490 --> 17:22.410
But I'm sticking my
neck out here. Is

17:22.450 --> 17:24.410
there anything you're
not telling me?

17:24.460 --> 17:25.710
I'll tell you anything
you wanna here,

17:25.750 --> 17:26.960
if you let me
out of these cuffs.

17:27.000 --> 17:28.330
I can't let you outta
the cuffs.

17:28.380 --> 17:30.210
Because, although I like you,
I don't trust you.

17:30.250 --> 17:31.800
And I'm afraid you're gonna
run off somewhere.

17:34.010 --> 17:37.090
Wow. You're good
at lock picking.

17:37.140 --> 17:40.100
This is a very stylish jacket.

17:40.140 --> 17:43.640
I love it. Classic, yet new
looking. Impressive.

17:43.680 --> 17:44.890
Very nice.

17:44.930 --> 17:46.390
How did you get out
of the cuffs?

17:46.440 --> 17:49.360
I'm double jointed.

17:51.230 --> 17:52.110
What?

17:53.030 --> 17:53.940
Come here.

17:54.860 --> 17:55.990
Huh? What? No!
What?

17:56.030 --> 17:57.530
No. I'm not going in there.

17:57.570 --> 17:58.780
What?

17:58.820 --> 18:00.700
I gotta put you in here.
Because--

18:00.740 --> 18:02.540
It's the best place to
keep you save and

18:02.580 --> 18:04.500
to keep you from,
you know, bolting.

18:04.540 --> 18:07.000
No, I'm sorry, man.
I'll do a lot of things.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.790
But this is one
thing I will not

18:08.830 --> 18:10.460
do. I will not go
in the dumpster.

18:10.500 --> 18:12.750
I'm not going in there!

18:13.510 --> 18:14.420
Just watch your fingers.

18:14.460 --> 18:15.380
Jake! Jake!

18:15.420 --> 18:17.090
I gotta lock it, so--

18:17.130 --> 18:18.590
I think there's some
diapers in here.

18:18.640 --> 18:21.350
Breathe. Naturally.

18:28.100 --> 18:30.060
You have the metal box,
which is good.

18:30.110 --> 18:31.400
Where is Oscar Noonan?

18:31.440 --> 18:34.440
First things first, Andre.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.820
We both know that
you hired Oscar to find

18:36.860 --> 18:39.320
the box. And we both
know that it's empty.

18:39.360 --> 18:42.030
You used it to lure me here.
Why?

18:42.070 --> 18:45.200
You're a little to clever for
your own good, I'm afraid.

18:45.250 --> 18:47.500
Have you forgotten

18:47.540 --> 18:48.620
our agreement?

18:48.670 --> 18:49.620
Okay. A:

18:49.670 --> 18:51.630
I didn't agree to
anything.

18:51.670 --> 18:54.170
And B: I don't care what you, or
your thugs are gonna do to me.

18:54.210 --> 18:56.170
I'm not gonna help you kill
Oscar Noonan.

19:10.310 --> 19:11.230
She's gone.

19:11.270 --> 19:12.360
She took Oscar.

19:12.400 --> 19:13.770
You idiot.

19:13.820 --> 19:15.690
Wait a minute.

19:15.730 --> 19:17.360
What is going on here?

19:17.400 --> 19:20.150
Why do you want him so bad.
What is he to you?

19:20.200 --> 19:23.530
Oscar Noonan is my brother.

19:23.570 --> 19:25.540
And now you may have
gotten him killed.

19:29.790 --> 19:31.210
[Jake] Look, Dad.

19:31.250 --> 19:32.920
Just stay put until you hear
from me, okay.

19:32.960 --> 19:34.460
Sure. I'm keeping
Des as backup.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.090
Oh yeah. He's gonna save you.

19:35.130 --> 19:36.750
[Des] Dude.

19:36.800 --> 19:39.300
Well hey your face is going to
be so red because I’m still here

19:39.340 --> 19:40.800
Des, listen.

19:40.840 --> 19:43.300
Some skeety guy name
Oscar stole my phone.

19:43.340 --> 19:45.260
I'm using my other phone, okay.
I need you to track my real one.

19:45.850 --> 19:45.890
-Sure. -Des.

19:47.560 --> 19:50.850
Find the phone. And text me on
this one if you find anything.

19:53.060 --> 19:54.310
What do you got?

19:54.360 --> 19:56.150
You mean about Oscar and Andre
being brothers.

19:56.190 --> 19:57.110
Nothing definitive.

19:57.150 --> 19:58.280
Do you think it's the truth?

19:59.440 --> 20:01.320
He didn't seem like
he was bluffing.

20:01.360 --> 20:03.910
And honestly, I don't
think Oscar knows.

20:03.950 --> 20:06.990
Apparently Besson and Oscar are
related on the father's side.

20:07.030 --> 20:08.120
But they got
different mothers.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.450
What else do we know
about Andre?

20:09.500 --> 20:10.710
Okay.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.710
Andre Besson from
Montreal. Born into the job.

20:12.750 --> 20:15.210
Father was a Boss.
Has a rare blood type--

20:15.250 --> 20:16.210
B negative.

20:16.250 --> 20:17.710
Married. Has kids. Loves dogs.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.380
I don't know, Jake.
He's a bad guy.

20:20.420 --> 20:21.340
What about Harley?

20:21.380 --> 20:23.300
Any relation to the Bessons?

20:23.340 --> 20:25.430
No. She's a well known skeet
bag taking bets around town.

20:25.470 --> 20:26.510
But no connection to the Mob.

20:26.550 --> 20:28.390
[message sound]

20:28.430 --> 20:29.850
Rose, I gotta go.

20:32.390 --> 20:33.190
Leslie.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.810
So nice to, uh,
see you. Hi.

20:36.860 --> 20:42.700
Hi. Uh, I heard you were back
in town and that you have a--

20:42.740 --> 20:43.700
Baby.

20:43.740 --> 20:44.660
Yeah.

20:44.700 --> 20:46.370
Yeah. He's great.

20:46.410 --> 20:48.780
Listen, so Jake and
I-- he left me a

20:48.830 --> 20:50.870
message, so I know
he's still alive.

20:50.910 --> 20:52.790
Alive? What are you
talking about?

20:52.830 --> 20:55.080
He told me in his
message not to tell you. And--

20:55.120 --> 20:56.380
not to tell the police.
But--

20:56.420 --> 20:57.960
I'm worried.

20:58.000 --> 21:00.380
Tell me everything. Especially
if he told you not to.

21:00.420 --> 21:01.880
Okay. So, where's
out for coffee.

21:01.920 --> 21:04.050
Nothing for you to be worried
about. Just a simple hi--

21:04.090 --> 21:04.550
How are you.

21:04.590 --> 21:05.970
Nikki.

21:06.010 --> 21:07.390
I mean, he did insist that
it'd be just us, not David

21:08.560 --> 21:09.890
But I wouldn't read anything
into that.

21:09.930 --> 21:10.850
It's more about

21:10.890 --> 21:11.810
him hating David.

21:11.850 --> 21:13.060
Nikki.
What happened?

21:13.100 --> 21:18.070
Okay. So... these
guys. Well, they--

21:19.190 --> 21:21.110
They kidnapped him.

21:22.150 --> 21:23.780
Malachy.
You can't be at that.

21:23.820 --> 21:24.740
Is that right?

21:24.780 --> 21:25.660
Yeah.

21:25.700 --> 21:26.570
I think I'm at it, son.

21:26.610 --> 21:27.780
Well, I'll press
the call button.

21:27.820 --> 21:30.080
You do. And I'll press
you into the floor.

21:30.120 --> 21:32.250
Well you win, again.

21:32.290 --> 21:34.540
How deep is Jake into
this thing?

21:34.580 --> 21:36.290
Those guys are pretty serious.

21:36.330 --> 21:37.250
Apparently.

21:37.290 --> 21:38.500
Oh, no, no, no.

21:40.000 --> 21:40.920
Des.

21:42.960 --> 21:44.090
Give me the pants.

21:44.130 --> 21:45.970
No, Mal, this is for
your own good.

21:46.010 --> 21:47.590
I'm not kidding around,
Des.

21:47.640 --> 21:49.010
Give us the pants.

21:49.050 --> 21:51.060
Or you gets a lift up in
the hole. Do you hear me?

21:53.430 --> 21:55.430
I'm only surrendering
these pants to you

21:55.480 --> 21:57.650
because I'm
dating your granddaughter.

21:58.730 --> 22:00.980
And because you can
kick my ass.

22:01.820 --> 22:03.610
You're stubborn Malachy.

22:03.650 --> 22:05.190
You knows your supposed
to stay here. We just--

22:05.240 --> 22:07.240
We just want you to
get better.

22:17.040 --> 22:18.080
[Harley]
You'll do anything to get

22:18.120 --> 22:19.040
out from under me,
won't you?

22:19.080 --> 22:20.210
You're not my type, at all.

22:20.250 --> 22:21.380
And don't take that personally.

22:21.420 --> 22:23.670
Because not many women are.

22:23.710 --> 22:26.840
Well, I'm not a big fan of men.
So we're even.

22:26.880 --> 22:30.680
Is that who I think it was,
chasing after us back there?

22:30.720 --> 22:35.220
Yeah. Yeah. You're in a whole
mess of trouble now.

22:35.270 --> 22:38.690
Andre Besson does not like
to be messed with.

22:38.730 --> 22:40.610
And I'm a close

22:40.650 --> 22:42.690
to get me back.

22:42.730 --> 22:44.400
Maybe they'll reach
into their deep

22:44.440 --> 22:46.320
pockets and pay
to get you back.

22:47.610 --> 22:49.780
Let me think on that
while we go for a ride.

22:49.820 --> 22:51.410
[ring]

23:03.340 --> 23:04.460
What?

23:04.500 --> 23:05.800
If I was you, I'd get
out of the way.

23:10.640 --> 23:11.760
Phone. Now please.

23:14.260 --> 23:16.560
Oscar. Get in the car!

23:23.060 --> 23:25.530
You know, the door actually
works, right.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.780
Yeah, you're right.

23:26.820 --> 23:28.070
I think I cut my bum.

23:32.990 --> 23:35.790
She hits really, really hard.

23:35.830 --> 23:37.160
You'll live.

23:37.200 --> 23:39.580
What if I have some sort
of internal blood loss?

23:39.620 --> 23:41.000
Hey. If I lose
too much blood--

23:41.040 --> 23:42.670
you gotta tell the
doctors I'm B Negative.

23:42.710 --> 23:43.750
They'll need to know that.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.710
About that.

23:45.750 --> 23:47.380
What if I was to tell
you that Andre

23:47.420 --> 23:50.340
is also a B Negative
kind of guy.

23:50.380 --> 23:51.840
Really.

23:51.880 --> 23:53.300
What if I was also
to tell you that

23:53.340 --> 23:54.930
Andre's also your half
brother on your father's side.

23:55.640 --> 23:56.720
What did you say?

23:56.760 --> 23:57.680
Your brother.

23:57.720 --> 23:59.890
Well, he's mobbed up.

23:59.930 --> 24:02.480
I mean, I was an orphan.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.810
Growing up. I never had a--

24:04.860 --> 24:07.030
Andre Besson's my brother?
He's like my-

24:07.070 --> 24:07.610
Real brother?

24:07.650 --> 24:09.240
It seems like it.

24:09.280 --> 24:11.530
If you think about it that can
actually be really good for me.

24:11.570 --> 24:14.620
How is being married to the
mob gonna be good for you?

24:14.660 --> 24:15.660
Well, the obvious benefits.

24:15.700 --> 24:17.450
Cash flow. Honor.

24:17.490 --> 24:20.870
Family helping to get rid
of people who beat me up.

24:20.910 --> 24:22.250
Unbelievable.

24:22.290 --> 24:24.460
You want Andre to whack
Harley for you.

24:24.500 --> 24:26.340
No. No, no, no.

24:26.380 --> 24:27.710
But suggesting a
pair of concrete

24:27.750 --> 24:30.090
boots in her size
might speak volumes.

24:30.130 --> 24:31.510
Wait a minute.

24:31.550 --> 24:33.840
Wait a minute. Do you
have my phone again?

24:35.140 --> 24:37.970
Yeah, sorry man.
It's a force of habit. I just

24:38.010 --> 24:39.560
get drawn in by
the force of your

24:39.600 --> 24:41.230
jack and I have to
steal your phone.

24:42.520 --> 24:44.560
[ring]

24:44.600 --> 24:47.110
[Jake] Rose. Good
news, I've got Oscar.

24:47.150 --> 24:48.570
That's wonderful.

24:48.610 --> 24:50.150
Because I've got Rose.

24:50.190 --> 24:52.280
Your office.
Fifteen minutes.

24:52.320 --> 24:54.740
And this time I'd better see you
bring Oscar through the door.

24:56.120 --> 24:56.990
Son of a...

24:57.990 --> 24:59.290
I don't know how you
do things.

24:59.330 --> 25:00.790
But our family

25:00.830 --> 25:03.960
reunions don't usually
involve gun play.

25:07.790 --> 25:09.550
Taking nitroglycerine, huh?

25:10.380 --> 25:12.010
The only reason I notice

25:12.050 --> 25:15.090
is because my husband had a
heart attack a few years ago.

25:15.130 --> 25:16.300
A lot of drugs.

25:16.340 --> 25:17.100
Diet change

25:17.140 --> 25:18.300
is not easy.

25:18.350 --> 25:19.850
That's why you bought the
medical equipment.

25:21.350 --> 25:22.560
You're dying.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.850
I'll need to rely on those
machines soon.

25:28.190 --> 25:30.150
I've got to die in my own bed.

25:30.190 --> 25:31.570
I don't know--

25:31.610 --> 25:33.490
How long I got.

25:33.530 --> 25:35.780
I just wanna spend
some time with my

25:35.820 --> 25:38.280
only brother
before it's too late.

25:39.530 --> 25:42.160
And he's on his way
here.

25:48.170 --> 25:51.500
Des. It's me.
Just calling to say hi.

25:51.550 --> 25:52.760
Wondering if you
wanna have supper

25:52.800 --> 25:54.170
later. Maybe at
Poppy and Rose's.

25:54.220 --> 25:55.130
[beep]

26:13.570 --> 26:14.740
You need to come with me.

26:14.780 --> 26:16.200
Excuse me!

26:16.240 --> 26:18.740
No questions. Just walk
with me now.

26:19.820 --> 26:21.160
Ow.

26:21.200 --> 26:22.490
Not so nice, is it?

26:25.830 --> 26:27.620
Scream. Or try
anything like that

26:27.670 --> 26:29.750
again and I'll
have to kill you.

26:31.090 --> 26:34.260
I don't want to kill you.
But I will.

26:42.560 --> 26:43.680
Jake, what are--

26:44.390 --> 26:45.930
Ah, ah, ah...

26:47.390 --> 26:48.810
Now.

26:48.850 --> 26:50.730
You let Rose
go.

26:50.770 --> 26:51.650
And you can have Oscar.

26:52.940 --> 26:54.650
Oh, you haven't got it
in you, friend.

26:54.690 --> 26:56.990
Buddy, you threaten mine--

26:57.030 --> 26:58.950
And you have no idea what
I'll do to yours.

26:58.990 --> 27:02.780
Please, Mr. Besson. I've been
beaten up a lot today.

27:02.830 --> 27:04.580
And it's like a three
percent chance

27:04.620 --> 27:06.580
I'll survive getting
my chin blown off.

27:06.620 --> 27:08.670
[Jake] Lay the gun on the
floor and kick it over to me.

27:08.710 --> 27:09.670
Now.

27:11.290 --> 27:12.790
Do it!

27:20.510 --> 27:21.390
Oscar.

27:24.890 --> 27:26.390
Get outta town!

27:27.390 --> 27:28.310
I do that too-

27:28.350 --> 27:29.270
When I'm nervous.

27:29.310 --> 27:30.850
So did our father.

27:30.890 --> 27:34.020
So this brother thing.
It's legit.

27:34.570 --> 27:35.480
It is.

27:35.530 --> 27:36.980
Wow. Cool. I mean

27:37.030 --> 27:39.360
it's a lot to take in but
I'm generally excited

27:39.400 --> 27:41.160
I've never had family before.

27:41.200 --> 27:42.700
You're all I have left.

27:42.740 --> 27:46.290
Our father passed
a few years back.

27:46.330 --> 27:48.660
The rest of my family's gone.

27:48.700 --> 27:49.830
It's only us.

27:56.500 --> 27:58.260
Oscar, why do you have a gun
pointed at me?

27:58.300 --> 28:01.800
Jake. I appreciate everything
you've done for me. I do.

28:01.840 --> 28:03.260
But I can't let you

28:03.300 --> 28:05.260
turn him in. He's my bro

28:05.300 --> 28:08.970
now. So...
I gotta go.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.440
[Andre]
Good job, Oscar.

28:11.310 --> 28:13.310
Good Job.

28:14.940 --> 28:15.980
And as for you.

28:16.020 --> 28:18.440
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:18.480 --> 28:22.740
Would you do me a family solid
and not shoot Jake.

28:23.700 --> 28:24.160
Sure.

28:25.490 --> 28:27.330
But don't ever let me see you
again, Mr. Doyle.

28:28.410 --> 28:30.000
There's nothing that
I'd like more.

28:30.040 --> 28:31.330
What do you think about

28:31.370 --> 28:34.500
going somewhere to sit.
Get to know each other?

28:34.540 --> 28:39.760
That'd be. Pow! I mean,
that's be great.

28:49.220 --> 28:50.480
Close the door.

28:54.140 --> 28:56.400
There is something very wrong
about this whole thing.

28:56.440 --> 28:58.690
I guess even made men
have feelings.

28:58.730 --> 29:01.240
Maybe he just wanted to connect
with the only blood he has left.

29:02.320 --> 29:03.660
Andre's dying,
Jake.

29:04.240 --> 29:04.780
Andre's what?

29:05.370 --> 29:06.740
It's his heart .

29:08.080 --> 29:10.370
If Andre's dying.

29:10.410 --> 29:13.040
And he just happens
to have a rare

29:13.080 --> 29:16.380
blood time that
Oscar also has,

29:16.420 --> 29:18.290
Compatible blood and
tissue matches.

29:18.340 --> 29:20.260
Andre needed a new heart.

29:22.340 --> 29:24.380
Andre doesn't want to connect
with his half-brother.

29:24.430 --> 29:25.890
He wants his heart.

29:25.930 --> 29:27.180
Uggh.

29:28.510 --> 29:29.680
Well now.

29:34.600 --> 29:36.980
Jake. Are you okay?

29:37.020 --> 29:41.150
I talked to Nikki. Pick up
your friggin' phone.

29:41.190 --> 29:43.110
Sergeant. You got a sec?

29:43.150 --> 29:45.700
Not if it has anything to do
with your uncle, I don't.

29:46.740 --> 29:48.200
It has to
do with this.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.660
I found this in my
phone earlier.

29:50.700 --> 29:51.830
This is police issue.

29:52.290 --> 29:53.750
I know.

29:53.790 --> 29:56.330
Are you saying that
someone from the force

29:56.370 --> 29:58.380
was trying to bug
your personal phone?

29:58.420 --> 30:00.340
I think someone's using me to
look into uncle Jake.

30:00.380 --> 30:01.250
What?

30:02.710 --> 30:04.380
I checked my history.

30:04.420 --> 30:06.010
And someone was searching my
computer for Jake Doyle.

30:06.050 --> 30:07.890
I know I wasn't.

30:10.850 --> 30:13.980
I'll handle it. Try not to
worry about it.

30:18.270 --> 30:19.940
[Jake]
Look. We gotta find

30:19.980 --> 30:22.360
Oscar before Andre literally
rips his heart from his chest.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.940
Family tissue match.
Better chance

30:23.980 --> 30:25.440
Andre's gonna survive
a heart transplant.

30:25.490 --> 30:27.320
Wait. If you're gonna transfer
a human organ,

30:27.360 --> 30:29.570
don't you need,
like a load of dry ice?

30:29.610 --> 30:31.780
Yeah. It's like bringing fish
home on a long driving trip.

30:31.830 --> 30:33.410
Well maybe Andre bought--

30:33.450 --> 30:34.830
Already checked. Okay.

30:34.870 --> 30:37.080
Andre's holding company had
a quantity of dry ice

30:37.120 --> 30:38.920
delivered to 200 Ropewalk
Lane this morning.

30:38.960 --> 30:40.380
200? Isn't that right next to
the bowling alley?

30:40.420 --> 30:41.880
It is. Good job Rose.

30:41.920 --> 30:42.800
Thank you.

30:48.220 --> 30:49.590
[Jake]
Oh hey. Remember me?

30:49.640 --> 30:50.510
[punch]

31:08.820 --> 31:10.620
Oh. Am I too early for
the glow bowl?

31:12.240 --> 31:14.330
No. But you're just
in time to get

31:14.370 --> 31:15.250
your head knocked off.

31:16.200 --> 31:17.410
[bang]

31:18.540 --> 31:20.920
Strike! Well. More of
a spare, really.

31:23.590 --> 31:24.500
Mmmm!

31:24.550 --> 31:25.420
Shhh!

31:31.390 --> 31:32.510
Mmmm!

31:32.550 --> 31:34.180
When I take this off,
don't say a word.

31:34.220 --> 31:35.270
Arrgh!

31:37.390 --> 31:39.350
The reunion went really,
really bad, Jake.

31:39.390 --> 31:40.310
You gotta get me outta here.

31:40.350 --> 31:41.690
Okay, shhhh!

31:41.730 --> 31:43.190
That's exactly what I'm
trying to do.

31:43.230 --> 31:44.770
I mean, he's trying to
take my heart.

31:44.810 --> 31:47.480
I've stolen some stuff over
the years, but this?

31:47.530 --> 31:49.700
It's a little extreme,
I know, I know.

31:49.740 --> 31:50.900
He's my brother.

31:50.950 --> 31:52.320
I mean, I don't even know
where to begin.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.240
I'm the full range of
emotions today, man!

31:54.280 --> 31:55.660
Okay. Look. Buddy.

31:55.700 --> 31:59.040
We'll find you a good therapist.
But we gotta go. Now.

31:59.080 --> 32:00.080
[Nikki]
Get your hands off me!

32:02.420 --> 32:03.330
Nikki?

32:03.380 --> 32:04.250
Jake!

32:26.110 --> 32:28.320
Oscar. I'm gonna get
you outta this.

32:28.360 --> 32:30.900
But first I'm gonna
need your help.

32:46.290 --> 32:48.250
Just so you know,
Mr. Crazytown,

32:48.300 --> 32:50.920
I am not a surgeon, or a
transplant specialist.

32:50.960 --> 32:53.590
Well, my doctor was
held at security

32:53.630 --> 32:55.050
and couldn't
make it from Montreal.

32:55.090 --> 32:58.890
And as the clock is ticking,
you're my only option.

32:58.930 --> 33:00.560
I hope, for your sake,

33:00.600 --> 33:01.680
you're good at

33:01.730 --> 33:02.940
winging it.

33:02.980 --> 33:03.890
I told you--

33:03.940 --> 33:04.900
If you fail, everyone

33:04.940 --> 33:06.440
close to
you will die.

33:09.610 --> 33:12.450
Like your husband,
David, yes?

33:13.570 --> 33:15.450
And that's a terrible

33:15.490 --> 33:16.870
place to be

33:16.910 --> 33:18.490
for a young
mother,

33:18.530 --> 33:19.620
Nikki.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.830
Nice to see you, Jake.

33:24.620 --> 33:25.500
Oscar.

33:27.170 --> 33:28.130
Jake.

33:28.170 --> 33:29.300
[Jake]
Are you okay?

33:29.340 --> 33:32.970
Been better. You?

33:33.010 --> 33:34.220
Same.

33:34.260 --> 33:36.130
For the record, I'm doing
pretty terrible.

33:36.180 --> 33:38.300
[Andre] I know she's
your ex-wife, Jake.

33:38.350 --> 33:40.220
I will blow her head
off right now.

33:40.260 --> 33:41.140
Jake.

33:42.140 --> 33:43.100
Please don't.

33:43.140 --> 33:44.890
Drop the gun.

33:49.690 --> 33:50.940
Drop the gun!

34:00.450 --> 34:01.580
Doyle.

34:02.740 --> 34:04.660
Cuff yourself to that
table over there.

34:06.290 --> 34:08.920
Oscar. Please, get on
the table brother.

34:08.960 --> 34:12.130
Andre. If you took, like, a
minute to get to know me,

34:12.170 --> 34:13.590
You'd see that
I'm a good earner.

34:13.630 --> 34:14.970
I could make enough
money to buy you a new

34:15.010 --> 34:16.220
heart from
someone not so--

34:16.260 --> 34:17.140
Alive maybe?

34:22.930 --> 34:25.350
So, Besson.

34:25.390 --> 34:26.810
What do you think
your chances are

34:26.850 --> 34:28.350
of actually surviving
this thing?

34:28.400 --> 34:30.270
Better than yours.

34:31.190 --> 34:33.030
Oscar is doing a good thing.

34:33.070 --> 34:35.900
The Besson empire
will continue to

34:35.940 --> 34:38.950
grow, because
I'll be there to run it.

34:38.990 --> 34:40.070
Think of it as a

34:40.120 --> 34:41.830
sacrifice
for our family.

34:43.290 --> 34:44.830
You know Oscar--
It's really too

34:44.870 --> 34:46.000
bad that your brother

34:46.040 --> 34:47.160
doesn't
have the same kind of

34:47.210 --> 34:50.250
flexibility that you have.

34:52.090 --> 34:52.960
You're--

34:54.630 --> 34:57.220
You're not gonna really
do this, are ya?

34:57.260 --> 34:58.340
Why not?

34:58.380 --> 34:59.680
He's a bastard child.

34:59.720 --> 35:01.220
Only good for one thing.

35:01.260 --> 35:03.010
My spare parts.

35:07.640 --> 35:08.560
Nikki--

35:08.600 --> 35:09.560
Oscar! Go!

35:12.810 --> 35:14.520
No more of your garbage,
Doyle.

35:14.570 --> 35:16.690
I'm a man down
and I'm tired of you.

35:20.610 --> 35:24.080
This is not at all how
I wanted this to go.

35:24.870 --> 35:26.290
Can we get back to it?

35:30.210 --> 35:33.500
Yeah. Thanks a lot.
I'll look into it.

35:37.460 --> 35:38.590
Something the matter?

35:38.630 --> 35:41.390
I don't know. You tell me.

35:42.510 --> 35:44.470
I'm not following you,
Sergeant.

35:44.510 --> 35:46.930
Okay. Let me spell it
out for you.

35:46.970 --> 35:50.310
Constable Doyle came to me.
She found a bug in her phone.

35:51.730 --> 35:54.900
That's interesting. Does she
know how it got there?

35:54.940 --> 35:58.900
No. But whoever did it was
searching her computer for info

35:58.940 --> 36:01.740
on Jake Doyle.
Is your computer fixed?

36:02.320 --> 36:03.240
Inspector?

36:03.280 --> 36:04.410
Are you accusing me?

36:04.450 --> 36:05.660
Are you looking into
Tinny Doyle?

36:06.870 --> 36:09.960
Fine. I'll talk to
the Brass, then.

36:10.500 --> 36:11.330
Wait.

36:12.080 --> 36:14.880
It's not Tinny, or Jake.

36:14.920 --> 36:16.800
It's a long
old story.

36:16.840 --> 36:18.960
But you're gonna have
to trust me.

36:19.010 --> 36:22.380
How am I supposed to
trust you?

36:22.430 --> 36:24.470
What I'm looking into.

36:24.510 --> 36:27.060
It could run right up the
flagpole to the top.

36:27.100 --> 36:29.350
I need to make sure that no
one knows what I'm doing.

36:29.390 --> 36:31.980
I think there might be someone
working from the inside.

36:32.020 --> 36:34.110
Now, I know you're clean.

36:35.400 --> 36:36.650
In fact, I picked you
because of it.

36:37.860 --> 36:39.820
And what does this have to
do with Tinny?

36:50.410 --> 36:51.750
[Oscar]
Andre. Andre.

36:51.790 --> 36:53.580
I know there's this
tendency in your

36:53.620 --> 36:55.790
line of work to be
a little revenge-y.

36:55.830 --> 36:57.710
But this whole pound
of flesh thing. Don't

36:57.750 --> 36:59.920
you think you're
taking it a bit literally?

36:59.960 --> 37:01.130
[Jake]
Obviously

37:01.170 --> 37:03.340
the concept of
brotherly love is lost

37:03.380 --> 37:04.840
on him as well.

37:04.880 --> 37:09.270
Okay. Get to it, doctor. We
have a helicopter to catch.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.100
Okay.

37:14.140 --> 37:18.400
Okay. But first we have to
prepare the transport cooler.

37:19.320 --> 37:20.360
Jake.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.030
I need Jake to transfer
the dry ice

37:22.070 --> 37:23.530
from one of those

37:23.570 --> 37:24.700
Styrofoam containers over there.

37:25.700 --> 37:26.570
Doyle.

37:28.490 --> 37:29.580
Do it.

37:31.580 --> 37:32.830
You heard the man.

37:34.160 --> 37:35.040
Just go.

37:40.920 --> 37:43.130
Okay, so put the gloves on.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.430
Put the dry ice in that
container.

37:52.850 --> 37:53.730
Good.

37:55.690 --> 37:57.190
Okay, now put the water in.

37:58.440 --> 37:59.440
Put the water on it.

38:00.110 --> 38:00.980
Okay.

38:10.370 --> 38:11.240
Now shut it.

38:12.370 --> 38:13.250
Latch it.

38:14.960 --> 38:15.870
[Jake]
Nikki look out!

38:15.910 --> 38:16.790
Ahhhh!

38:19.630 --> 38:20.960
[bang]

38:25.800 --> 38:26.800
[Michael]
Doyle.

38:32.060 --> 38:32.930
Oof!

38:33.470 --> 38:34.480
Stay there!

38:36.480 --> 38:37.350
[bang]

38:49.660 --> 38:50.620
[Nikki]
Jake!

38:50.660 --> 38:52.370
He's losing a
lot of blood.

38:53.240 --> 38:54.120
Oscar.

38:56.330 --> 38:58.120
That was quite a ride.

38:58.160 --> 39:00.460
Sure was. I forgot
how ridiculously

39:00.500 --> 39:03.170
dangerous it is to
be around you.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.460
Hold on a second.

39:05.510 --> 39:05.670
Jake.

39:07.260 --> 39:09.340
Well, you look a lot better
than you did a few hours ago.

39:09.380 --> 39:12.850
Yeah, well. I lost a lot
of blood. But your...

39:12.890 --> 39:13.970
[Nikki]
Just--

39:14.010 --> 39:15.470
Nikki.

39:15.520 --> 39:19.310
Right. She saved me.
She saved my life.

39:19.350 --> 39:23.150
You almost died. Except, you
were lucky that someone here

39:23.190 --> 39:25.150
just happened to have your
exact blood type.

39:25.730 --> 39:26.780
I guess so.

39:26.820 --> 39:28.450
[in French] I can't believe my

39:28.490 --> 39:29.650
blood is saving
this moron's life.

39:29.700 --> 39:31.320
My blood is saving him?
Really?

39:31.360 --> 39:32.870
Thank you.
That's very generous.

39:32.910 --> 39:33.910
Keep looking

39:33.950 --> 39:35.580
over your
shoulder, brother.

39:35.620 --> 39:38.290
Locked up or not,
I can still get to you.

39:39.460 --> 39:41.420
And I'm not done with you,
Mr. Doyle...

39:42.250 --> 39:43.500
[Jake]
Don't mind him.

39:43.540 --> 39:44.840
He'll get over it.

39:44.880 --> 39:46.250
I really owe you a lot, man.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.760
I do. And I got
this feeling that this

39:48.800 --> 39:53.220
whole experience is gonna
change me for the good.

39:53.260 --> 39:54.850
Glad to hear it Oscar.

39:55.680 --> 39:56.930
You take care, my friend.

39:59.890 --> 40:02.350
What do you think?
Shall I drive you home?

40:02.400 --> 40:04.060
That would be great.
Seeing as my

40:04.110 --> 40:06.320
rental car is totaled.
Thanks to you.

40:11.660 --> 40:12.570
[Harley]
I told you.

40:12.610 --> 40:14.280
This isn't
over between us.

40:15.870 --> 40:18.830
Should I be as excited as I am
hearing you say that to me?

40:18.870 --> 40:21.750
No, you should not.

40:24.000 --> 40:27.210
Trust me.

40:39.520 --> 40:40.480
Hey.

40:41.390 --> 40:43.480
Okay. Don't freak out.

40:44.770 --> 40:47.690
But I was supposed to move
into my apartment.

40:47.730 --> 40:49.400
But it fell through.

40:49.440 --> 40:51.610
And I don't
have anywhere else to live.

40:52.400 --> 40:54.030
No, no, no, no. What?

40:54.070 --> 40:55.280
Well, Malachy--

40:55.320 --> 40:57.370
He kinda, he kicked me out.
Sort of.

40:59.910 --> 41:01.160
Why would he do that?

41:02.540 --> 41:04.170
Malachy's getting old.

41:04.210 --> 41:05.710
And...

41:05.750 --> 41:09.840
He felt there were too many
young people... walking around

41:09.880 --> 41:11.550
You know. Anyway,
it's gonna be great.

41:11.590 --> 41:13.590
I got it all planned out.
I got it all planned out.

41:13.630 --> 41:15.760
So, it's gonna be good.
I'm gonna

41:15.800 --> 41:18.350
take the room down the hall.

41:18.390 --> 41:19.430
The closet.

41:19.470 --> 41:21.560
The room, the room!
The small room.

41:21.600 --> 41:25.770
And then you and I, we share the
kitchen. We share the bathroom.

41:25.810 --> 41:27.650
I can cuddle you at night,
if you're cold.

41:28.610 --> 41:29.860
I would never do that.

41:29.900 --> 41:31.990
But- the other stuff.

41:33.900 --> 41:35.110
How long?

41:35.150 --> 41:36.660
Not very long.
I just need a place to crash.

41:36.700 --> 41:38.490
just for a little while.
Okay?

41:39.950 --> 41:41.790
You know, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

41:41.830 --> 41:42.960
This is a bad idea.

41:44.250 --> 41:48.790
Bad idea. I guess I'll just go
out in the cold.

41:49.380 --> 41:50.590
Knock it off.

41:50.630 --> 41:51.550
I can't believe I'm gonna

41:51.590 --> 41:52.170
say this.
But you can stay.

41:52.460 --> 41:53.800
If--

41:53.840 --> 41:56.930
you stay out of my way and
you know it's temporary.

41:56.970 --> 41:58.390
And it's not for long.

41:59.850 --> 42:01.220
It's fine.

42:01.260 --> 42:02.930
Gear. Perfect. 'Cause
I think I can

42:02.970 --> 42:05.850
fit my canoe right
in along there.

42:05.890 --> 42:07.400
I'm just joking.
I don't have a can--

42:07.440 --> 42:08.730
Oh, what time is it?
Let's listen to

42:08.770 --> 42:09.730
Big Tom's Shed.
Dibs on the couch.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.320
You on your way out?

42:14.360 --> 42:15.280
Yeah.

42:15.320 --> 42:16.240
Long day.

42:16.280 --> 42:17.700
Hot bath and bed.

42:17.740 --> 42:19.570
I hear ya.

42:19.620 --> 42:22.620
So, any word on who was
looking into Jake?

42:24.120 --> 42:26.830
It was a tech. She's got a bit
of a crush on your uncle.

42:26.870 --> 42:28.540
That's all.

42:28.580 --> 42:30.540
Thanks for looking into it.
See you tomorrow.

42:30.590 --> 42:32.880
Yeah. Have a good night.
