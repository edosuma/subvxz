00:02.032 --> 00:05.271
Even when I was dealing,
I wanted people to like me.

00:05.272 --> 00:08.471
Not just because they'd
sell they left nut for crack,

00:08.472 --> 00:09.902
but because I was likeable.

00:11.312 --> 00:14.472
Tray, what you give me
for this here baby, huh?

00:14.482 --> 00:16.082
I don't want no stuffed doll, man.

00:16.262 --> 00:17.621
Give me my money, man, you owe me.

00:17.645 --> 00:19.355
- You owe me $20.
- I don't owe you nothing. Smell it.

00:19.379 --> 00:21.551
No, I ain't smelling no
fuck fake baby, man.

00:21.745 --> 00:23.175
- Give me my money.
- Then I'll give you a real baby.

00:23.199 --> 00:24.882
No. You already owe me $20.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.191
- Beat it.
- I owe you $19.

00:26.192 --> 00:28.052
- Get out of here, man.
- Fine, I'm going.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.621
- Thank you, Soapy.
- I'm not coming back.

00:29.622 --> 00:31.261
Get that shit out of here, man.

00:31.262 --> 00:33.061
Yo, boy, girl, boy, girl, boy...

00:33.062 --> 00:35.106
You already know what this is, man.

00:35.131 --> 00:36.490
No, man, come on, man.

00:36.515 --> 00:38.632
Come on, nothing, man.
Run your shit, brah.

00:39.772 --> 00:41.732
You know my pedigree, kay.

00:43.872 --> 00:46.377
Just so you know, man, was
no money for the Angel, man,

00:46.402 --> 00:48.801
so the Boat ain't nothing
but weed dipped in pee.

00:51.839 --> 00:53.008
You're a funny guy, man.

00:53.033 --> 00:54.093
What's your name?

00:54.118 --> 00:55.347
- Tray.
- Tray.

00:56.305 --> 00:57.804
Well, don't take this personal, Tray,

00:57.805 --> 00:59.674
but, uh, we get it how we live it.

01:01.675 --> 01:03.214
Some nice shoes.

01:03.215 --> 01:04.843
- Nah, man.
- Run them shits.

01:04.845 --> 01:06.644
Come on, man, I got foot fungus, man.

01:06.645 --> 01:09.684
My toes already look like
they was attacked by mice.

01:13.185 --> 01:15.085
Can't make me walk
home in my socks, man.

01:15.095 --> 01:16.724
Ain't nothing but crackhead
pee on these blocks, man,

01:16.725 --> 01:17.868
on the streets, man.

01:17.893 --> 01:19.664
One of them dudes just
shitted over there, man.

01:19.665 --> 01:21.864
I step in that, I'm doomed.
You know what I'm sayin'?

01:21.865 --> 01:23.634
My toenails is already dead.

01:23.635 --> 01:26.325
Don't make them have to
have a closed-casket funeral.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.565
Right, okay. Look, man.

01:30.745 --> 01:34.355
You funny and all that,
so, uh, keep the shoes.

01:35.350 --> 01:36.832
I'm liking that jacket, though.

01:37.621 --> 01:39.114
Nah, man, it's cold out here, man.

01:39.115 --> 01:40.968
It's just too cold out here

01:40.993 --> 01:42.584
for you to be without an extra jacket.

01:42.585 --> 01:44.830
I know that. Pardon me, sir.

01:44.855 --> 01:47.955
- This look good on you.
- Think so?

01:47.980 --> 01:49.739
Yes, yes, Lord.

01:49.764 --> 01:50.964
Nice doing business with you.

01:50.989 --> 01:52.089
Fellas.

01:55.256 --> 01:57.455
I found out that dude's
name was Green Eyes.

01:58.610 --> 01:59.774
They called him Green Eyes

01:59.799 --> 02:01.559
because he wanted what other people had

02:01.875 --> 02:04.040
and wasn't afraid to
catch a body to get it.

02:04.705 --> 02:06.632
That night, he let me off easy.

02:06.995 --> 02:09.193
My personality's taken me far in life.

02:09.375 --> 02:12.923
It's taken me from slinging
crack to slinging snacks.

02:14.191 --> 02:16.960
This time, I'm only hurting
them in their wallets

02:16.985 --> 02:18.645
and their cholesterol numbers.

02:18.670 --> 02:20.005
And the best part about it,

02:20.030 --> 02:22.799
I'm finally doing something
that's gonna make my mom's proud.

02:23.495 --> 02:25.055
And at least I don't have to worry

02:25.065 --> 02:26.825
about the authorities anymore.

02:27.456 --> 02:28.516
Damn it!

Josh, thanks for helping out today, man.

02:36.895 --> 02:38.385
You're welcome, my friend.

02:38.403 --> 02:40.863
I'm gonna breeze out
and go see my PO at 5:00.

02:40.873 --> 02:43.172
What? What are you talking about?

02:43.173 --> 02:45.233
No, no, no, no, no.
I can't handle this on my own.

02:45.243 --> 02:46.903
- You're not going anywhere.
- You got this.

02:46.913 --> 02:49.572
You know, if you find yourself
stuck, just ask yourself,

02:49.573 --> 02:50.787

02:53.413 --> 02:55.644
Can't you see I'm ironing a sandwich?!

02:56.120 --> 02:58.005
Told you you got it.

02:58.030 --> 02:59.252
Come on back, brother. I got you.

02:59.253 --> 03:01.183
- I'll take your order.
- I'm sorry.

03:03.393 --> 03:05.292
Last Meal on Wheels,
you got to check it out.

03:05.293 --> 03:06.792
It's delicious. Last Meal on Wheels.

03:06.793 --> 03:09.462
You're gonna love it. Nothing
like a good prison meal.

03:09.463 --> 03:11.462
- Hey. Happy opening day.
- Hey, girl.

03:11.463 --> 03:13.963
- Thank you.
- Congratulations, girl.

03:13.973 --> 03:16.332
Thank you, thank you, thank you,
thank you. Hey, you hungry?

03:16.333 --> 03:18.072
Don't Drop of the Soup of
the day is chicken noodle.

03:18.073 --> 03:19.298
Oh, I'll be all right.

03:19.323 --> 03:21.872
I can't believe I'm dating
a small business owner.

03:21.873 --> 03:24.442
Yeah, you know, like, I own
it, but I don't own it, own it.

03:24.443 --> 03:25.971
- What you mean?
- You know what I'm talking about?

03:25.995 --> 03:28.343
Like, you know,
I designed it, I fixed it up,

03:28.353 --> 03:30.382
but I'm more like
a behind-the-scenes type dude,

03:30.383 --> 03:31.804
- you know what I mean?
- Uh-huh.

03:31.829 --> 03:33.952
Matter of fact, let me go and
introduce you to my employee.

03:33.953 --> 03:36.022
I mean, my... you know what I'm saying.

03:36.023 --> 03:39.295
Aah! What up, Boogie?

03:39.320 --> 03:42.692
Oh, my God, girl, where you been?

03:42.693 --> 03:43.896
Hey, Lisa.

03:43.921 --> 03:45.084
Oh, y'all know each other?

03:45.109 --> 03:47.132
- Oh, yeah, we know each other.
- Unh-unh.

03:47.133 --> 03:49.289
I need you to take that
stank out your voice.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.132
Boogie, check your girl.

03:52.157 --> 03:54.108
Check me, bitch? Check your memory.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.812
- Bitch? Okay.
- I'm supposed to act cool with you

03:55.836 --> 03:57.422
after you broke into my house.

03:57.447 --> 03:58.675
- Okay, hold on one second...
- No, no, no, no, Lisa,

03:58.699 --> 03:59.765
don't do this right now.

03:59.790 --> 04:02.012
- Nah,
- I got your "bitch." Come on, let's go.

04:02.013 --> 04:03.182
No, no, no, no, chill, chill, chill.

04:03.183 --> 04:04.682
- Let's go.
- You got too much money.

04:04.683 --> 04:07.383
You got too much to lose
and too many witnesses, okay?

04:07.393 --> 04:08.922
We can handle this situation later.

04:08.923 --> 04:11.153
Oh, I'm a situation now.

04:11.163 --> 04:13.392
- Yes, bitch, you a situation.
- Unh-unh, calm down!

04:13.393 --> 04:14.892
No! Yo, chill!

04:14.893 --> 04:17.625
- You need to calm down, Boogie.
- I'm gonna fuck you up!

04:17.651 --> 04:20.161
Whoa! Y'all better take this ghetto shit

04:20.163 --> 04:21.572
away from my prison truck!

04:22.273 --> 04:23.516
Can you believe it?

04:23.541 --> 04:25.370
Can you believe... Girl!

04:26.071 --> 04:27.542
Can you believe that shit?

04:27.543 --> 04:29.672
Gonna look me straight in
the eyes like we buddies,

04:29.697 --> 04:31.197
like I'm the one with the problem.

04:31.222 --> 04:33.158
And who was that fool she
was with, talking about

04:33.183 --> 04:35.143
"Who she using the B-word with"?

04:35.153 --> 04:37.652
Girl, that was my ex's cousin Bobby.

04:37.653 --> 04:40.222
Now, he's a player, if that
makes you feel any better,

04:40.223 --> 04:41.552
so you don't have
nothing to worry about,

04:41.553 --> 04:43.222
'cause as soon as he
see a braless jogger,

04:43.223 --> 04:46.092
- he's kicking her straight to the curb.
- Mm-hmm.

04:46.093 --> 04:47.523
You gonna apologize to
that baby back there?

04:47.533 --> 04:49.062
Yeah, can you come with me 'cause I'm...

04:49.063 --> 04:51.463
Excuse me, ma'am! I'm sorry!

04:52.703 --> 04:55.016
Okay, so, all that back
there was over a dude.

04:55.475 --> 04:57.009
His name was Greg.

04:57.573 --> 05:01.203
And so, okay, so, it had turned out

05:01.213 --> 05:04.473
that he was married to her, but...

05:04.483 --> 05:06.082
You know what? See,
there it is right there.

05:06.083 --> 05:08.043
Like, I already knew that
it was more to the story.

05:08.053 --> 05:09.882
Okay, but he never told me, okay?

05:09.883 --> 05:12.722
We was together for months
before Faith found out.

05:12.723 --> 05:15.122
And when I tried to tell
her my side of the story,

05:15.123 --> 05:18.056
she was just so angry
there was no talking to her.

05:18.751 --> 05:21.950
And now, you know what?

05:21.983 --> 05:23.652
I should just go.

05:23.677 --> 05:25.237
I don't deserve you.

05:25.403 --> 05:28.672
I know you probably think
I'm a ho, that I ain't shit.

05:29.078 --> 05:31.608
So you know what? I'm just gonna go.

05:33.527 --> 05:34.996
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

05:35.021 --> 05:36.120
Don't.

05:37.343 --> 05:38.512
I don't think you're a ho.

05:39.961 --> 05:40.998
You don't?

05:42.313 --> 05:43.382
No.

05:43.526 --> 05:45.795
I mean, if he didn't tell you

05:45.820 --> 05:47.413
he was married, how
you supposed to know?

05:47.437 --> 05:49.015
How was I supposed to know?

05:49.843 --> 05:51.653
And I think you're a good woman.

05:51.928 --> 05:54.538
And you was dealing with
a dude who doesn't deserve you.

05:56.265 --> 05:57.359
Bobby...

05:58.163 --> 06:00.432
you the best man I ever been with.

06:02.273 --> 06:03.833
I could agree with that.

06:23.993 --> 06:25.092
Hey.

06:25.453 --> 06:26.998
Uh, pretty good actually.

06:27.023 --> 06:28.692
Yeah, word of mouth goes a long way.

06:28.693 --> 06:29.732
That's great.

06:30.039 --> 06:31.600
Most start-up businesses don't make it.

06:31.899 --> 06:34.032
Congratulations on
a successful first day.

06:34.033 --> 06:35.432
Oh, yeah.

06:35.735 --> 06:37.502
That's nice of you to say. Thank you.

06:37.503 --> 06:41.381
Unfortunately, uh, kind of
closing down around here.

06:41.406 --> 06:43.303
- Sorry.
- Oh, I'm not here for food.

06:44.729 --> 06:47.108
I'm here to collect taxes for
being in this neighborhood.

06:47.813 --> 06:49.512
Oh, okay.

06:49.513 --> 06:51.588
Man, I heard the IRS was
getting pretty aggressive,

06:51.613 --> 06:54.022
but that's a scosh
overboard, don't you think?

06:54.277 --> 06:56.922
I can tell you slow, so I'm
gonna make this real simple.

06:57.723 --> 07:00.792
You work this neighborhood,
you work for me.

07:00.793 --> 07:02.932
And every month, you pay
taxes for the privilege

07:02.933 --> 07:04.193
of working my streets.

07:04.703 --> 07:05.762
Got it?

07:06.263 --> 07:08.063
Nigga, I said got it?!

07:08.073 --> 07:09.172
Yeah.

07:10.220 --> 07:13.242
I don't even know what...
W-W-What do we pay?

07:13.243 --> 07:15.673
However much I ask for
when the time comes.

07:20.083 --> 07:22.182
Ask the other trucks about BAMF.

07:22.983 --> 07:24.113
They know the deal.

07:36.034 --> 07:37.326
Joshua.

07:37.860 --> 07:39.390
Thanks for filling in last night.

07:39.930 --> 07:40.959
Uh-huh.

07:40.984 --> 07:42.923
Josh, you all right?

07:43.927 --> 07:45.596
I almost got robbed last night.

07:46.335 --> 07:47.564
- What?!
- Yeah.

07:47.589 --> 07:48.758
You okay?

07:48.783 --> 07:51.213
No, I'm... I mean,
I'm a little shaken up.

07:51.238 --> 07:52.607
I'm not hurt.

07:52.632 --> 07:55.155
This guy, he, like...
cleaning the grill,

07:55.180 --> 07:56.909
he comes up to me with a gun,

07:56.910 --> 07:59.049
tells me we got to start paying taxes.

07:59.050 --> 08:01.000
What the... I don't...
I told the police.

08:01.025 --> 08:02.415
They didn't give a shit.

08:02.440 --> 08:04.640
Oh, some things
in Brooklyn haven't changed.

08:05.120 --> 08:07.459
Guys in this neighborhood
been making business owners

08:07.460 --> 08:09.516
pay taxes since my pops was a shorty.

08:09.969 --> 08:11.529
Why didn't you just say my name, man?

08:11.530 --> 08:12.859
They would've put some 'spect on it.

08:12.860 --> 08:15.227
I don't know. I don't know
the rules of the street.

08:15.252 --> 08:16.651
Hey, I'm a TV writer.

08:16.800 --> 08:18.930
The most gangster thing
that I've ever done

08:18.940 --> 08:20.539
is fill out that police report.

08:20.815 --> 08:21.877
- Really?
- Yeah.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.809
Wait a minute. You did smack, heroin.

08:24.810 --> 08:26.349
- Thank you.
- Then rode the white horse.

08:26.373 --> 08:29.379
You wrestled with Indonesia,
where Godzilla was born.

08:29.404 --> 08:30.733
And you're married to Shannon.

08:30.758 --> 08:32.910
It don't get no more gangster than that.

08:34.778 --> 08:36.068
Isn't Godzilla from Japan?

08:36.092 --> 08:37.904
No, he destroyed Japan.

08:37.929 --> 08:39.513
He was born in Indonesia.

08:44.225 --> 08:46.694
Hey, hey.

08:46.719 --> 08:48.184
- Good morning.
- Good morning to you.

08:48.208 --> 08:50.008
Hey, you're the fella
with the jailhouse truck.

08:50.032 --> 08:51.782
Last Meal on Wheels, yeah, that's me...

08:51.807 --> 08:53.645
- Tray Barker.
- My name's Curlan.

08:53.670 --> 08:54.839
This is my wife, Irene.

08:54.840 --> 08:56.169
I've tried some of your food.

08:56.170 --> 08:57.839
It's darn good.

08:57.840 --> 08:59.530
- Oh, wow.
- What brings you by?

08:59.555 --> 09:01.792
Checking out the, uh, competition?

09:01.817 --> 09:03.925
I'm just really trying to figure out

09:03.950 --> 09:05.549
the tax situation around here.

09:05.574 --> 09:06.703
We don't know shit.

09:07.344 --> 09:09.483
I just need to know the name
of who I need to talk to.

09:09.508 --> 09:11.777
You got dicks in your ears
or you just hard of hearing?

09:11.802 --> 09:14.293
I told you, we don't know shit.

09:14.318 --> 09:16.987
Look, I'm not trying
to stir anything up.

09:17.167 --> 09:19.332
I'm just trying to figure
out how to do business.

09:20.543 --> 09:23.485
Fine. I'll throw in a couple
hundred of plates and cups.

09:23.510 --> 09:24.961
Just tell me a name, please.

09:25.549 --> 09:26.618
Deal.

09:26.643 --> 09:28.842
Guy you have to talk to is BAMF.

09:28.867 --> 09:30.285
B-A-M-F.

09:30.310 --> 09:31.406
It's an acronym.

09:31.431 --> 09:33.090
It stands for Bad Ass Motherfucker.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.164
I suggest you don't be
late with the payments.

09:35.189 --> 09:37.220
- Where can I find him?
- Just go to Prospect Park.

09:37.245 --> 09:38.315
He'll find you.

09:40.992 --> 09:42.051
Thank you.

09:42.076 --> 09:43.175
We don't know you.

09:44.754 --> 09:48.910
98, 99, 100.

09:48.935 --> 09:50.293
Very impressive. Can you get to...

09:50.317 --> 09:51.576
- I'm a warrior, Josh!
- Can you help out?

09:51.600 --> 09:52.759
- Look at the line.
- Warrior!

09:52.760 --> 09:54.359
Okay, can we please get to work?

09:54.360 --> 09:55.581
- I need some help.
- Bobby.

09:55.606 --> 09:57.625
Oh, what's up, Shay? I'm on fire today.

09:57.650 --> 09:58.679
If you coming to work,

09:58.704 --> 10:00.433
I'm gonna need you to do some push-ups.

10:00.458 --> 10:03.285
No, I came here to warn
you about crazy-ass Lisa.

10:03.310 --> 10:04.980
Don't believe anything
that comes out of her mouth.

10:05.004 --> 10:06.933
All she do is lies, okay?

10:06.958 --> 10:08.995
- Lisa ain't shit.
- What are you talking about?

10:09.822 --> 10:11.902
Look, Lisa's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

10:12.107 --> 10:13.576
Like, we doing grown folk stuff.

10:13.601 --> 10:15.461
Jazz concerts, farmers markets.

10:15.486 --> 10:16.815
We even did wine tasting.

10:16.840 --> 10:19.247
And breaking news...
not every wine is sweet.

10:19.272 --> 10:20.289
- That's crazy.
- Bobby.

10:20.290 --> 10:21.375
No, don't "Bobby" me.

10:21.400 --> 10:23.669
Look, I understand that
your girl and Lisa got beef,

10:23.694 --> 10:25.463
but that ain't got
nothing to do with me.

10:25.488 --> 10:29.587
Your issues with my girl is
exactly that... your issues.

10:29.612 --> 10:31.912
Look, she believes in me.
She believes in my dreams.

10:31.937 --> 10:34.375
She believes in you cloning
Rihanna and having a threesome?

10:34.400 --> 10:36.681
Well, not that one exactly,
but... but I'll tell you this.

10:37.272 --> 10:39.411
She's the first person
to tell me that I'm right.

10:39.436 --> 10:41.280
- Y'all never do that.
- You're wrong, Bobby.

10:41.305 --> 10:42.351
That's what I'm saying right there.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.594
I'm not getting in y'all drama, Shay.

10:43.618 --> 10:45.094
I'm not. I'm not getting into it.

10:45.119 --> 10:46.943
You know what I'm saying? It's my girl.

10:48.379 --> 10:49.438
Hey, babe.

10:50.060 --> 10:52.063
I did my push-ups before you got here.

10:55.387 --> 10:57.646
- Called a ride?
- Nah, man, I'm good.

10:57.671 --> 10:59.753
Nah, you definitely called a ride, Tray.

11:01.146 --> 11:02.846
Yo. How you know my...

11:11.003 --> 11:12.533
How you know my name, man?

11:12.558 --> 11:14.675
I make it my business
to know people looking for me.

11:15.451 --> 11:17.090
So you must be BAMF.

11:17.115 --> 11:19.614
When I was a shorty, my side
hustle was jumping out of cabs

11:19.639 --> 11:22.054
without paying, not
actually being the cab.

11:22.079 --> 11:24.748
You know, the neighborhood
changed a long time ago.

11:24.773 --> 11:26.402
Now-a-days, white people call the cops

11:26.427 --> 11:28.266
on young brothers loitering, so...

11:28.743 --> 11:31.946
ride sharing is the way to do
business under the radar, a'ight?

11:32.686 --> 11:33.745
So what's up?

11:33.770 --> 11:35.539
Why you asking people about me, huh?

11:35.564 --> 11:37.933
'Cause you rolled up on my
business last night, man.

11:37.958 --> 11:39.597
I came here hoping
I could have a man-to-man

11:39.621 --> 11:40.845
conversation with you.

11:40.878 --> 11:44.219
I just did a 15-year bid
up in Southfield, right?

11:44.244 --> 11:46.903
Just came home a year ago,
trying to get back on my feet.

11:47.073 --> 11:49.825
And me and my mans, we just want to know

11:49.850 --> 11:51.864
if we could get a pass
on them street taxes.

11:54.336 --> 11:56.765
Is stupid a side dish on your truck?

11:56.915 --> 11:58.515
You just as dumb as that white boy.

11:58.540 --> 11:59.999
Ain't no pass on taxes.

12:00.024 --> 12:02.424
I'm Uncle Sam in this bitch, you heard?

12:02.449 --> 12:03.886
Any more questions?

12:05.633 --> 12:06.910
Nah.

12:07.779 --> 12:09.098
That's what I thought.

12:10.629 --> 12:12.259
Hi. Are you Richard?

12:12.284 --> 12:13.383
Yes.

12:13.408 --> 12:15.637
I can see you guys are going to Harlem.

12:15.870 --> 12:17.809
Traffic's light, so it
shouldn't take too long.

12:17.810 --> 12:20.739
Enjoy the complimentary
water in the cup holders.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.017
We should be there shortly.

12:22.042 --> 12:23.112
Thanks.

12:25.750 --> 12:28.319
- You guys like showtunes?
- Who doesn't?

12:28.636 --> 12:30.665
Superman is faster than the Flash.

12:30.690 --> 12:32.557
Like, in outer space, he's
breaking the speed of light.

12:32.565 --> 12:33.566
- That's 2.9...
- What does it say

12:33.590 --> 12:35.065
on the back of the action-figure box?

12:35.075 --> 12:37.134
It says the Flash, fastest man alive.

12:37.135 --> 12:38.980
Does that say that shit on Superman box?

12:39.005 --> 12:41.597
- No. No. No. It only...
- It goes without saying.

12:41.622 --> 12:44.066
No, no, no, no. No it fucking don't.

12:44.091 --> 12:46.284
Tray. Tray. You good?

12:46.804 --> 12:47.944
One of these little sags out here

12:47.968 --> 12:49.554
is trying to extort my ass, man.

12:50.082 --> 12:51.835
What happened to the code
of the streets?

12:51.860 --> 12:54.359
The only street code
in Brooklyn now is to curb your dog.

12:54.897 --> 12:57.226
I seen a hipster get his mustache
smacked off for breaking that one.

12:57.250 --> 12:59.779
Nah, man, I'm just talking
about basic respect, man.

13:00.196 --> 13:01.514
Sag out here, man.

13:02.733 --> 13:04.043
They don't got no respect

13:04.068 --> 13:05.466
for nobody that been where they been.

13:05.490 --> 13:07.036
'Cause we always remind
them we been where they been,

13:07.060 --> 13:09.254
and yet we ain't got
shit to show for it.

13:09.279 --> 13:13.048
Ah, man, shit just
changed out here too much.

13:13.073 --> 13:15.296
- Who used to run this block?
- Why does that matter?

13:15.321 --> 13:18.320
Because either young boy
took the block from the OG

13:18.345 --> 13:20.844
or the OG gave the block to the boy.

13:20.869 --> 13:23.301
And if it's the latter,
then that's who he respect.

13:24.580 --> 13:25.817
Got a point there, man.

13:26.958 --> 13:28.597
Plus I think you right about the Flash.

13:28.622 --> 13:30.351
- Dah!
- No, no, no, no.

13:30.376 --> 13:33.146
Flash, two time, pop, pop!

13:40.998 --> 13:42.097
Tray.

13:42.477 --> 13:43.776
What you doing here, man?

13:43.801 --> 13:45.531
Green Eyes, I need to talk to you, man.

13:45.556 --> 13:47.555
Good for me you still
live with your moms.

13:47.580 --> 13:49.740
Actually it's my daughter house now.

13:49.765 --> 13:51.220
Big ups to your moms, man.

13:51.245 --> 13:52.573
She raised your daughter right.

13:52.843 --> 13:54.066
Man, come in.

13:55.747 --> 13:56.792
What's good?

13:57.971 --> 13:59.400
Hustlin', strivin'.

13:59.637 --> 14:00.854
- You?
- Just here, man.

14:00.879 --> 14:02.300
I'm trying to be like
you when I grow up.

14:02.324 --> 14:04.197
It's your world, baby.

14:04.222 --> 14:06.191
- I'm just trying to live in it.
- Nah.

14:06.216 --> 14:07.903
I'm living in a world where
one of these young sags

14:07.927 --> 14:10.836
out here, man, trying to
charge me a food-truck tax.

14:10.861 --> 14:12.027
Pulled a toaster on me, man.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.491
Some kid named BAMF.

14:13.516 --> 14:15.915
- You know him?
- Yeah.

14:15.993 --> 14:18.192
Listen, Green Eyes, man,
you one of the few people

14:18.217 --> 14:20.257
in the world that could help
me out with this, a'ight?

14:20.281 --> 14:21.659
If you see the kid on the streets,

14:21.684 --> 14:23.613
put a bug in his ear or something, man.

14:23.638 --> 14:25.239
I give you whatever
you need after that...

14:25.263 --> 14:26.653
free food, anything.

14:26.678 --> 14:28.037
I have a gun.

14:28.062 --> 14:29.688
For me, everything already free.

14:29.713 --> 14:32.382
Figure something out, man.
You know, OG to OG,

14:32.785 --> 14:36.024
If you see the kid, Green,
say something to the kid.

14:36.025 --> 14:37.440
All right, let me stop you right there.

14:37.464 --> 14:38.677
We cool, Tray.

14:39.619 --> 14:41.196
But this ain't really my business.

14:42.894 --> 14:43.933
Bet.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.480
I'll figure it out.

14:46.498 --> 14:48.410
Like I did everything
else in my life, man.

14:48.435 --> 14:50.474
My bid, man... my first
two years was hard.

14:51.070 --> 14:54.021
I would go to the showers with
my boxers on and my socks, man,

14:54.046 --> 14:55.846
'cause I didn't want to
get raped or feet fungus.

14:55.870 --> 14:58.209
But didn't it backfire on me, man?

14:58.234 --> 15:01.160
I ended up getting feet fungus
in my junk and raped on my feet.

15:01.185 --> 15:03.214
Man, you still a funny dude, brah.

15:03.459 --> 15:05.596
I ain't believing I'm-a
say this, but what the hell?

15:06.460 --> 15:09.502
Let's see if we can talk to
old BAMF right quick, huh?

15:09.527 --> 15:10.566
All right.

15:11.867 --> 15:14.466
Yo, Green, as kids growing up,

15:14.491 --> 15:15.990
we ain't always see eye to eye, man.

15:16.295 --> 15:18.119
You're still one of the realest to me.

15:18.144 --> 15:19.713
Unh-unh. I said "we."

15:19.738 --> 15:22.368
You ain't using me as your own
personal thug telegram service.

15:22.518 --> 15:23.947
They only point their joints at me.

15:24.846 --> 15:26.374
The hell you think this is?

15:27.492 --> 15:29.208
Whoa, whoa, can I ask you a question?

15:30.486 --> 15:32.086
You only stole one of those vests?

15:33.945 --> 15:35.257
What I'm gonna wear?

15:35.282 --> 15:37.012
What I'm gonna wear?

15:40.623 --> 15:42.483
Well, if you'd allow me to elucidate,

15:42.508 --> 15:45.737
the subcontext is the dualistic nature

15:45.762 --> 15:47.656
of violent inner-city life.

15:47.681 --> 15:49.611
Mm, okay. Let me ask you a question.

15:49.636 --> 15:51.435
Where in the Bible, uh, does it say

15:51.460 --> 15:52.659
that Jesus was bow-legged?

15:52.684 --> 15:54.283
Because he bow-legged as hell.

15:54.308 --> 15:56.407
Boom! Ha! Broke down.

15:56.432 --> 15:57.601
Inaccurate.

15:57.626 --> 15:59.525
Eh! Eh!

15:59.550 --> 16:00.649
You don't know nothing.

16:00.674 --> 16:01.868
Boy, you and that brain.

16:01.893 --> 16:02.953
Hey.

16:05.970 --> 16:09.048
Hey, he the best in bed.

16:09.073 --> 16:14.342
I mean, out of all the
guys, he the best ever.

16:14.400 --> 16:16.039
- I mean, you the best.
- What the hell?

16:16.072 --> 16:18.301
- What are you...
- What?

16:18.326 --> 16:20.595
- Oh, my... Hey, Greg.
- No, no, no, no.

16:20.650 --> 16:23.589
- You are not allowed within 40 feet of me.
- What?

16:23.590 --> 16:25.957
How was I supposed to know
you was even gonna be here?

16:25.982 --> 16:27.434
'Cause I own this gallery.

16:27.459 --> 16:30.419
Well, that's what you said,
but you know you be lying.

16:30.600 --> 16:32.778
Like that time you said
you owned that couch

16:32.803 --> 16:35.380
and that car and the keys to my heart.

16:35.405 --> 16:36.704
Is this performance art?

16:36.729 --> 16:37.943
I'm gonna need you to shut your mouth.

16:37.967 --> 16:40.696
See, I'm trying to be cordial,
but I need you to go.

16:41.098 --> 16:42.637
You know what? Bump this.

16:42.991 --> 16:45.485
You lucky I don't have my
boyfriend whoop your ass.

16:46.572 --> 16:48.376
I know you ain't talking...
You ain't talking about me.

16:48.377 --> 16:49.377
I know you ain't talking
about... 'cause that...

16:49.378 --> 16:51.391
that is... you damn
sure that ain't true,

16:51.563 --> 16:53.633
you know what I'm saying? You
know what? Shay told me about you.

16:53.661 --> 16:55.155
- I don't have time for this.
- Don't stick your fingers in my face.

16:55.179 --> 16:56.803
- I don't have time for this.
- Don't stick your fingers in my face!

16:56.827 --> 16:58.308
You're lucky I'm on probation.

17:01.060 --> 17:02.807
So, what you doing after this?

17:09.980 --> 17:11.950
- This where he hang?
- Yeah.

17:13.673 --> 17:15.172
You never been here.

17:16.334 --> 17:18.005
We ain't about no games.

17:18.556 --> 17:20.826
Yeah, man, I'm getting in that ass.

17:23.568 --> 17:25.328
Rocket launcher, bitch!

17:27.990 --> 17:29.421
What's good?

17:29.538 --> 17:30.737
Ain't shit.

17:30.762 --> 17:32.492
Just wanted to talk to you about my man.

17:33.350 --> 17:34.609
This your man?

17:34.634 --> 17:36.898
Yeah, the one you pulled a gun out on.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.679
But I'm a peaceful man.

17:40.000 --> 17:41.399
Die, bitch!

17:41.424 --> 17:42.925
Nigga, you got me killed!

17:42.950 --> 17:44.719
Look, BAMF, you and Tray both my boys.

17:44.744 --> 17:46.486
We need to talk this tax thing out.

17:46.511 --> 17:47.810
Just treat him like fam.

17:47.835 --> 17:50.009
You know, treat him like you treat me.

17:51.281 --> 17:53.743
See, I know you.

17:55.105 --> 17:56.175
I don't know him.

18:02.304 --> 18:04.744
My dude, I appeal to you, man.

18:05.420 --> 18:07.312
What you trying to do,
I done did already.

18:08.128 --> 18:09.688
And one rule I learned...

18:09.800 --> 18:11.999
there's always somebody out
there younger or hungrier

18:12.000 --> 18:13.398
plotting to take your crown.

18:14.143 --> 18:15.242
Do what you gonna do.

18:15.730 --> 18:20.139
You gonna end up dead or in jail
or some old broke-head

18:20.140 --> 18:23.212
with knowledge and
nothing else, like me.

18:24.101 --> 18:25.782
That's why I came here
to talk to you, man.

18:26.163 --> 18:29.001
I did 15 years in prison
so you don't have to do it.

18:29.640 --> 18:30.978
I did it for you.

18:31.003 --> 18:32.073
I...

18:35.390 --> 18:37.119
Man, fuck this, man. Let's bounce.

18:37.859 --> 18:39.360
He don't want to hear nothing.

18:51.827 --> 18:53.812
You said some powerful things in there.

18:55.006 --> 18:56.365
Man.

18:56.624 --> 18:59.006
I'm about to be one of
them broke old-heads.

18:59.031 --> 19:01.161
The stick-up game ain't the same.

19:01.319 --> 19:02.948
Nobody carry cash.

19:03.043 --> 19:05.642
PayPal, Venmo... what am
I supposed to do with that?

19:05.667 --> 19:07.006
Shit if I know, man.

19:07.007 --> 19:09.036
My phone been locked for two months.

19:10.327 --> 19:11.459
I'm just saying...

19:13.757 --> 19:16.170
he wasn't listening, but I was.

19:17.304 --> 19:18.388
Look here.

19:19.677 --> 19:21.208
I'm-a come work on your truck.

19:22.264 --> 19:23.363
For free?

19:24.154 --> 19:26.393
'Cause after I pay this BAMF dude,

19:26.418 --> 19:28.440
I might not have enough
money to pay myself.

19:28.822 --> 19:30.823
You heard him. He know me.

19:31.440 --> 19:33.709
He ain't gonna collect
tax if I'm on that truck.

19:33.867 --> 19:36.388
Look, pay me half of what
you would've paid him.

19:36.603 --> 19:40.002
A'ight. But listen, if I hire
you, it got to be a fresh start.

19:40.027 --> 19:42.027
I cannot put Green Eyes on the paycheck.

19:42.052 --> 19:43.581
The government ain't having that.

19:43.606 --> 19:47.064
But if Dwayne want a job, I got you.

19:57.709 --> 19:59.489
I ain't got to pass a drug test, do I?

19:59.514 --> 20:00.954
Nah.

20:12.026 --> 20:13.550
You know you could've just text.

20:14.141 --> 20:16.440
Nah, some things you do in person.

20:16.519 --> 20:19.088
Okay, okay, so you want to
have a grown-up conversation?

20:19.362 --> 20:20.546
All right, all right, well, let me...

20:20.547 --> 20:21.760
let me... let me go first.

20:22.336 --> 20:24.975
Lisa, you got me fucked up, all right?

20:25.000 --> 20:26.086
Lose my number.

20:27.147 --> 20:28.203
I'm late.

20:28.586 --> 20:30.556
Oh, no, no. You right on time.
You right on time.

20:30.557 --> 20:32.367
We didn't schedule
this conversation, okay?

20:32.392 --> 20:33.798
You the one decided to show up.

20:33.823 --> 20:35.642
No, Bobby, like...

20:36.962 --> 20:38.384
late late.

20:43.535 --> 20:45.215
What, you, like, miss
a train or something?

20:45.909 --> 20:47.779
Bobby, I'm pregnant.

20:53.471 --> 20:54.710
Come in, man.

20:54.735 --> 20:56.265
Don't touch nothing, okay?
