00:10.343 --> 00:12.345
[theme music playing]

01:10.445 --> 01:12.197
[people screaming]

01:26.044 --> 01:27.212
-[alarm beeping]
-[gasps]

01:36.763 --> 01:39.808
[grunts] We have to take the fight
as far away from here as--

01:51.444 --> 01:53.530
[blade dragging]

02:00.286 --> 02:01.955
-[all grunting]
-[gasps]

02:21.391 --> 02:23.351
[rumbling]

02:23.434 --> 02:25.019
[panting]

02:25.103 --> 02:26.938
[screaming]

02:47.458 --> 02:48.293
[gasps]

02:50.920 --> 02:52.964
-Now let's finish this!
-[Lance] Incoming!

03:12.358 --> 03:14.527
[rumbling]

03:47.268 --> 03:50.063
[grunts] We can't let this happen.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.023
She can't get away.

03:52.273 --> 03:54.234
[all screaming]

03:56.986 --> 03:58.905
[all screaming]

04:20.593 --> 04:22.845
[all grunting]

04:36.442 --> 04:37.277
[grunts]

04:37.735 --> 04:39.487
-[Keith] Is everyone okay?
-[Hunk groans]

04:39.570 --> 04:40.905
-[Lance] Yep.
-[Pidge] Here.

04:40.989 --> 04:41.948
[Allura] Yes.

04:42.031 --> 04:43.866
[Shiro] Does anyone have eyes on Honerva?

04:45.368 --> 04:47.578
[pulsing]

04:47.662 --> 04:48.830
What is this place?

04:49.038 --> 04:50.665
I-- I'm not sure.

04:51.541 --> 04:53.376
-[Honerva] This is the beginning.
-[all gasp]

04:57.005 --> 04:58.881
And the end.

05:11.352 --> 05:15.064
-[people screaming]
-[Allura grunting]

05:15.148 --> 05:17.108
Can-- Can you all feel that?

05:18.192 --> 05:19.861
[Allura] These strands are...

05:20.194 --> 05:23.448
The only remaining realities
left in existence.

05:23.823 --> 05:29.037
This place is the source
of time, of space, of...

05:29.412 --> 05:30.455
[Hunk] Everything.

05:31.456 --> 05:34.876
I will end this

05:35.168 --> 05:38.838
once and for all!

05:46.763 --> 05:48.431
[all shouting]

05:52.727 --> 05:54.896
[Allura panting] She's destroying...

05:54.979 --> 05:57.857
-[all shouting]
-...all realities!

05:59.067 --> 06:00.068
[all shout]

06:03.154 --> 06:03.988
[grunts]

06:04.864 --> 06:05.823
Ah!

06:13.039 --> 06:15.583
-[grunting]
-[shouting]

06:15.666 --> 06:16.834
[grunting]

06:46.697 --> 06:49.784
[Keith] She's destroyed everything.
There's only one reality left.

06:50.451 --> 06:52.870
[gasps] No. Please.

06:56.332 --> 06:57.583
[growling]

07:11.889 --> 07:12.723
[grunts]

07:22.692 --> 07:23.693
[grunts]

07:28.781 --> 07:29.657
[all shout]

07:36.831 --> 07:40.668
If Honerva destroys this final strand,
all of existence will end with it!

07:44.464 --> 07:47.049
[all shouting]

07:48.050 --> 07:49.719
[console whirring]

07:58.311 --> 07:59.187
[gasps]

08:08.446 --> 08:10.656
[rumbling]

08:10.740 --> 08:12.742
[panting]

08:33.638 --> 08:35.306
[screaming]

08:35.389 --> 08:38.059
[all grunting]

08:41.938 --> 08:44.315
[panting]

08:52.823 --> 08:54.116
[Honerva] Where are we?

08:56.160 --> 08:58.955
The connected consciousness
of all existence.

09:00.206 --> 09:01.958
You think you're safe here?

09:02.416 --> 09:05.044
Soon, all will cease to exist.

09:05.795 --> 09:07.255
You have to stop this.

09:07.338 --> 09:11.133
All these worlds, all these realities,
they deserve to live.

09:11.759 --> 09:14.512
Those realities are flawed and weak,

09:14.971 --> 09:18.599
living out the same pathetic cycle
of war and pain.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.519
There is beauty in their flaws.

09:22.687 --> 09:26.524
I lost my father, my mother,
my planet, to this war...

09:27.692 --> 09:29.402
but I've gained a new family

09:29.485 --> 09:32.154
and a purpose stronger
than any I could have imagined.

09:32.613 --> 09:34.490
Humans began very flawed.

09:34.949 --> 09:36.701
There were wars, hate.

09:37.118 --> 09:39.662
But with each mistake,
they learned and grew.

09:39.996 --> 09:43.874
And now we reach out to other worlds
to pass on those same lessons

09:43.958 --> 09:46.544
and spread them
across the entire universe...

09:46.919 --> 09:48.379
like your people once did.

09:48.629 --> 09:52.216
And with every new world touched,
the message grows.

09:52.800 --> 09:55.261
Every world, every reality.

09:56.012 --> 09:58.139
We wouldn't exist without the others.

09:58.389 --> 10:01.267
Our differences are what make us stronger.

10:02.393 --> 10:05.521
You think your words mean anything to me?

10:06.397 --> 10:11.569
I've lived multiple lifetimes,
and all of them filled with pain and loss.

10:12.570 --> 10:16.449
If I cannot experience
the simple joys of life,

10:17.033 --> 10:18.826
why should anyone else?

10:22.622 --> 10:23.497
[gasps]

10:23.581 --> 10:24.832
[whooshes]

10:26.792 --> 10:30.630
[Allura] There was a time when you loved
more than just your family,

10:31.505 --> 10:35.468
a time when your fascination
with how vast the universe is

10:35.551 --> 10:39.055
gave way to your desire
to help and uplift others.

10:47.188 --> 10:49.106
The beginning of Altean alchemy.

10:49.690 --> 10:51.067
You tried to help him.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.903
-The tales you grew up with...
-He was happy.

10:55.529 --> 10:56.906
He deserved better.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.408
Better than I could give.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.579
Lotor may have been misguided,

11:03.788 --> 11:06.999
but, ultimately,
he wanted to preserve life.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.001
Honor your son.

11:09.919 --> 11:11.504
Help me change this.

11:14.131 --> 11:15.424
[Honerva] I'm sorry...

11:15.758 --> 11:17.510
but the damage is done.

11:17.927 --> 11:19.762
There's nothing left to save.

11:21.972 --> 11:24.642
I can change the Quintessence
within your vessel.

11:25.101 --> 11:27.853
Your son helped me learn
how to transform it

11:27.937 --> 11:31.482
from a destructive force
into a life-giving force.

11:32.483 --> 11:34.235
But I cannot do it alone.

11:35.403 --> 11:37.279
But that would require...

11:37.655 --> 11:38.906
I know the risks.

11:45.830 --> 11:48.249
I'm afraid this is where we part ways.

11:48.707 --> 11:49.875
-Wait, what?
-Allura.

11:49.959 --> 11:51.210
-What?
-No.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.673
This is our only chance
to undo what has been done,

11:55.756 --> 11:57.716
to save all of existence.

11:58.843 --> 12:00.136
I have to take it.

12:01.011 --> 12:02.346
It is my purpose.

12:03.097 --> 12:04.515
Your paths go on.

12:05.307 --> 12:06.559
Mine ends here.

12:07.351 --> 12:09.228
But there is no Voltron without you.

12:10.146 --> 12:11.772
Voltron isn't needed anymore.

12:12.731 --> 12:15.234
The rest of the work is up to the people.

12:16.193 --> 12:18.487
And they'll have you to guide them, Hunk.

12:25.244 --> 12:26.245
Goodbye, Pidge.

12:28.205 --> 12:29.748
I'm gonna miss you, Allura.

12:33.169 --> 12:36.130
Remain curious and fearless.

12:36.422 --> 12:38.424
[breathing shakily]

12:42.261 --> 12:45.598
Most of them won't know
the sacrifice you made so they could live.

12:46.348 --> 12:47.808
And they'll never need to.

12:48.476 --> 12:50.728
Your selflessness taught me that.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.314
Thank you.

12:54.899 --> 12:58.736
You never have to thank me for anything.

13:02.573 --> 13:03.407
Keith...

13:04.283 --> 13:06.869
I cannot thank you enough
for all you've given me.

13:07.703 --> 13:13.250
Allura, when you accepted me,
it helped me to accept myself.

13:14.502 --> 13:15.336
Thank you.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.714
There is greatness in your heart...

13:19.298 --> 13:20.758
and in your actions.

13:25.095 --> 13:25.930
No.

13:26.347 --> 13:27.223
Allura, there--

13:28.849 --> 13:30.434
There has to be another way.

13:30.976 --> 13:32.269
There is no other way.

13:33.395 --> 13:34.688
This is all we have.

13:35.898 --> 13:38.859
But you're too important to the cause.
You're-- [crying]

13:39.610 --> 13:41.195
You're too important to me.

13:42.238 --> 13:44.156
I'll always be with you, Lance.

13:45.449 --> 13:46.951
And I'll always love you.

13:56.752 --> 13:58.254
[whooshing]

15:04.153 --> 15:04.987
Is this...?

15:05.988 --> 15:06.864
Are we...?

15:07.156 --> 15:09.325
[console chirping]

15:09.408 --> 15:10.242
Yeah.

15:10.951 --> 15:12.119
It's our reality.

15:13.329 --> 15:14.413
[Lance] She did it.

15:15.789 --> 15:17.041
She saved us all.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.962
I don't remember that planet
being there before.

15:24.298 --> 15:25.382
[Lance] It's Altea.

15:37.227 --> 15:39.271
[Keith] With the return
of Planet Daibazaal,

15:39.355 --> 15:41.690
the Galra Empire is at a crossroads.

15:42.274 --> 15:45.778
For too long, the people
of this extraordinary civilization

15:45.861 --> 15:47.863
have been manipulated by a dictatorship

15:47.947 --> 15:51.617
that placed a misguided sense
of self-preservation above all else.

15:52.034 --> 15:54.662
It was a tragic,
unfortunate series of events

15:54.745 --> 15:57.998
that led us down this dark,
never-ending path of power and greed.

15:58.624 --> 15:59.500
But now...

16:00.125 --> 16:05.297
we, the citizens of the Galra Empire,
have an opportunity

16:05.673 --> 16:09.718
to make right all of the injustices
set into motion by our forefathers.

16:10.678 --> 16:13.389
Because of the sacrifice made
by Princess Allura,

16:13.472 --> 16:15.224
we have been given a second chance

16:16.016 --> 16:18.811
to come together in rebuilding
the Galra Empire

16:18.894 --> 16:21.063
by joining the Galactic Coalition

16:21.230 --> 16:25.359
and ushering in a new era of peace
across the universe.

16:25.442 --> 16:27.277
[crowd cheering]

16:30.698 --> 16:32.741
[male] Your armies
have attacked us at every turn.

16:32.825 --> 16:34.618
[female] If you had just agreed
to our terms,

16:34.702 --> 16:36.203
the attacks would not be necessary.

16:36.286 --> 16:38.706
You are occupying a peaceful settlement!

16:38.914 --> 16:41.375
-Our people were starving!
-Chancellors.

16:42.042 --> 16:44.712
Please, sit. Dinner is served.

16:45.170 --> 16:46.714
The filet of bandrillo,

16:46.797 --> 16:49.466
spiced with the seasoning
from the plains of planet Mabo,

16:49.800 --> 16:52.428
alongside pilaf
of long-grain forlongian brill

16:52.511 --> 16:54.096
from the vast fields of Antidoll.

16:54.179 --> 16:55.431
And it's accompanied by a cider

16:55.514 --> 16:57.808
made from the petals
of the Altean juniberry flower.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.059
Bon appÃ©tit.

17:01.854 --> 17:02.980
Delicious!

17:03.605 --> 17:05.441
It wouldn't be possible
without the cooperation

17:05.524 --> 17:07.568
of all three planets of the Xritoo system.

17:07.943 --> 17:09.153
Much like my cooking crew,

17:09.236 --> 17:11.405
comprised of aliens
from all across the cosmos

17:11.488 --> 17:14.033
working together to bring you
this delicious meal.

17:15.159 --> 17:19.163
Princess Allura, the very person
we celebrate on this day, once said,

17:19.246 --> 17:21.415
"We are always stronger together."

17:21.999 --> 17:24.043
If the people of your planets
work together,

17:24.126 --> 17:25.836
so much more can be achieved.

17:26.754 --> 17:28.839
Honor her by following in her footsteps

17:29.465 --> 17:31.425
and walk in the path towards peace.

17:34.845 --> 17:35.679
All done.

17:36.513 --> 17:38.849
So, have you been thinking of any names?

17:39.224 --> 17:41.310
Yeah, I was thinking of Chip.

17:42.603 --> 17:44.021
You and your puns.

17:44.354 --> 17:47.441
Katie, your father's got the teludav
all warmed up for you.

17:47.733 --> 17:50.110
Better get going.
You don't wanna be late.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.530
Don't worry, Pidge,
I'll have Chip all ready to go

17:53.614 --> 17:54.948
by the time you get back.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.117
Just don't initialize until I return.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.995
I want to witness Chip's first moments
of consciousness.

18:09.338 --> 18:11.965
-Have a good time, honey.
-[Pidge] I will, Dad.

18:21.433 --> 18:24.520
-[Merla] Construction is on course.
-[Coran] Ah, most excellent!

18:24.978 --> 18:27.481
How are the preparations
for tonight's feast coming?

18:27.564 --> 18:28.941
It has to be perfect.

18:29.316 --> 18:31.735
It will be
the first Celebration of Allura.

18:31.819 --> 18:33.529
The first of many to come.

18:34.571 --> 18:38.325
As soon as we can get access
to the location, we can begin setup.

18:38.408 --> 18:41.286
But it's currently occupied
by your friend, sir.

18:42.121 --> 18:45.499
And had Princess Allura not seen
that there was still good left in Honerva,

18:45.958 --> 18:48.502
we most likely
would not be sitting here today.

18:48.585 --> 18:51.964
She grew to understand
that there is good in everyone.

18:52.714 --> 18:54.299
[female] Even Emperor Zarkon?

18:55.342 --> 18:57.886
[chuckles] Yes, even Emperor Zarkon.

18:58.512 --> 18:59.680
Do you miss her?

19:00.848 --> 19:01.682
I do.

19:02.349 --> 19:03.267
Very much.

19:04.768 --> 19:07.354
But I'm reminded of her everywhere I look.

19:07.771 --> 19:10.691
So in that way,
she's still very much with me.

19:11.441 --> 19:12.943
With all of us, actually.

19:13.610 --> 19:17.197
Now that you no longer pilot the Red Lion,
what do you do?

19:17.573 --> 19:21.535
Well, I help run a small farm
back on my home planet with my family.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.371
It's a simple life.
Just the way I like it.

19:24.913 --> 19:25.998
All right, everybody,

19:26.081 --> 19:29.543
I think Paladin Lance has someplace
to be in a few doboshes.

19:29.710 --> 19:32.838
-And you all have class to get back to.
-[kids] Aw!

19:32.921 --> 19:34.590
[laughs]

19:35.757 --> 19:37.342
[booming, whooshing]

19:40.762 --> 19:43.640
[people laughing]

19:46.894 --> 19:49.813
I mean, seriously, though,
Earth has come a long way.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.732
It's a hub for all alien activity

19:51.815 --> 19:54.735
now that my dad's stabilized
his teludav technology.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.862
That'll make travel
on the Atlas much easier.

19:56.945 --> 20:00.115
We'll be able to reach many more sectors
with the improved mobility.

20:00.199 --> 20:02.868
Not to mention the supplies we'll save
with the shorter journey.

20:03.202 --> 20:06.538
Yeah, yeah! We'll have so much more room
for the cooking ingredients.

20:06.622 --> 20:09.666
People are just so much easier
to reason with when they're full.

20:09.750 --> 20:12.544
Man, this diplomacy thing isn't nearly
as easy as Allura made it look.

20:12.878 --> 20:13.795
Right?

20:13.879 --> 20:16.381
But then, she did make
everything look easy.

20:16.965 --> 20:19.843
Speaking of which,
how are things going on Daibazaal?

20:20.093 --> 20:22.638
We're calling for an election
to select the Galran representative

20:22.721 --> 20:24.181
for the Galactic Coalition.

20:24.264 --> 20:25.807
So that's a step in the right direction.

20:26.266 --> 20:27.267
Let me guess.

20:27.351 --> 20:29.937
They asked you to be their leader
and you said no?

20:30.145 --> 20:31.855
Yeah, pretty much.

20:32.105 --> 20:34.816
-Classic Keith.
-[others laugh]

20:35.234 --> 20:37.778
Allura would be proud
of your decision, Keith.

20:37.986 --> 20:41.698
I think she knew that you would always
be the key to the Galra's future.

20:42.366 --> 20:45.953
Just around this table, I see
so many lives touched by her actions.

20:46.286 --> 20:51.083
For some of us she was a diplomat,
a teacher, a leader, and a friend.

20:51.166 --> 20:54.628
But to those of us around this table,
she will always be...

20:56.880 --> 20:57.798
family.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.262
To Allura!

21:03.762 --> 21:05.764
[Paladins] To Allura.

21:14.356 --> 21:16.024
[low growl]

21:17.025 --> 21:17.859
Huh?

21:27.536 --> 21:29.079
[growls]

21:31.248 --> 21:32.666
[growls]

21:34.710 --> 21:36.211
[growls]

21:40.674 --> 21:41.967
[growls]

21:44.094 --> 21:45.762
[growls]

21:49.641 --> 21:51.518
[thrusters booming]

22:08.785 --> 22:10.787
[synth music playing]

22:55.707 --> 22:58.543
[crowd cheering]
