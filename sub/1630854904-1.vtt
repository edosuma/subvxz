00:35.690 --> 00:38.486
If you plant a seed early enough,

00:38.486 --> 00:41.041
you can spend your entire life
watching a tree grow.

00:44.044 --> 00:47.633
Seeing how high
it gets, how far it reaches
out into the world.

00:49.325 --> 00:51.396
For two boys growing up
on the edge of a lake,

00:51.396 --> 00:53.950
a seed was planted early.

00:53.950 --> 00:58.748
They fell in love with being
on the water and with the
same sport.

00:58.748 --> 01:00.853
And like every kid,
they dreamt of greatness.

01:02.131 --> 01:05.410
But greatness never comes
easy, right?

01:13.418 --> 01:16.145
This is the story of two brothers,

01:16.145 --> 01:20.873
how a shared obsession
pushed them
to keep progressing,

01:20.873 --> 01:25.706
while their competitive natures
threatened to pull them apart.

01:25.706 --> 01:28.640
The Derome brothers,
going head-to-head
in round number one.

01:31.470 --> 01:34.370
This is also
the story
about the power of passion...

01:40.169 --> 01:43.275
and how far sheer determination
can take you.

01:46.934 --> 01:53.423
And this is the story
of a family who shared
deeply-rooted values...

01:53.423 --> 01:55.460
...and a history of competing
on water.

01:57.841 --> 02:04.641
But most importantly, this is
a story with a beginning,
a middle and an end.

02:04.641 --> 02:07.989
Because once you've reached
the end of your story,

02:07.989 --> 02:10.509
the only thing left to do is
to tell it.

04:29.199 --> 04:30.028
Go.

04:33.134 --> 04:35.275
My dad always used
to say to me,

04:35.275 --> 04:37.380
"Sport is the school of life,"

04:37.380 --> 04:41.591
and that's, like, a beautiful
sentence that I try to
tell myself a lot.

04:41.591 --> 04:43.248
And, I think, through wakeboarding,

04:43.248 --> 04:46.286
I've learned so much
from, you know, relationships

04:46.286 --> 04:51.049
to loyalty, to dealing with
pressure, to overcoming obstacles.

04:51.049 --> 04:54.949
Like, wakeboarding
really forged
my attitude and my person.

04:54.949 --> 04:59.575
And I'm so thankful and
grateful that I had the
chance to grow up on a lake,

04:59.575 --> 05:01.611
and have a supporting family.

05:15.763 --> 05:16.971
I think you can do it.

05:17.869 --> 05:19.180
There you go.

05:19.180 --> 05:21.838
Did I just... pierce your ear
drum?

05:22.736 --> 05:24.358
I am Olivier Derome.

05:24.358 --> 05:27.637
I am from Coteau-du-Lac,
and I'm Raph's older brother.

05:30.709 --> 05:33.678
The story goes
that we were 16, 18 months old.

05:33.678 --> 05:36.370
My dad put us on skis
that were tied together

05:36.370 --> 05:37.613
and tied to the boom.

05:37.613 --> 05:39.131
He kind of holds us in place...

05:39.131 --> 05:40.995
...and we stand there
and we learned how to ski.

05:40.995 --> 05:42.376
And he did that with all four kids.

05:46.863 --> 05:49.625
If you're a Derome, you go on skis.

05:49.625 --> 05:50.729
It's the way to go.

05:54.043 --> 05:56.908
My parents
always told us that we're
so lucky to live by a lake,

05:56.908 --> 06:00.532
and it was their dream,
so they made it accessible...

06:00.532 --> 06:03.501
...and they also would encourage
us to go play in the lake.

06:06.883 --> 06:08.368
My dad has been into
waterskiing his whole life,

06:08.368 --> 06:10.542
so he's a Canadian champion
of waterskiing.

06:10.542 --> 06:13.856
So, for sure,
when you love something so much

06:13.856 --> 06:16.376
you want to pass it down to
your children.

07:12.121 --> 07:16.056
Waterskiing grew in popularity
through the 60s and 70s.

07:16.056 --> 07:18.955
And competitions included
three events.

07:18.955 --> 07:20.370
In Slalom,

07:20.370 --> 07:22.511
skiers would zig-zag through
a course of buoys

07:22.511 --> 07:24.478
as fast as possible.

07:24.478 --> 07:28.724
In Trick, they'd earn
points by performing as
many tricks as possible.

07:28.724 --> 07:32.244
Jumping was all about distance.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.680
Okay.

09:09.859 --> 09:12.034
So my dad was this fun,

09:12.034 --> 09:15.071
bubbly, like,
always-in-a-good-mood dad.

09:23.735 --> 09:26.842
But as a coach,
he didn't take the same role.

09:26.842 --> 09:30.535
So he was much stricter and
harder on us.

09:50.451 --> 09:51.901
You wake up in the morning,

09:51.901 --> 09:55.353
you go in the lake
and you have nothing to say.

10:00.013 --> 10:02.705
Whatever I do, I do it a
hundred percent.

10:02.705 --> 10:05.535
That's from my dad. Intensity.

10:13.613 --> 10:15.684
Olivier Derome.

10:15.684 --> 10:19.929
Skiing,
i didn't necessarily have, like,
a supernatural talent.

10:19.929 --> 10:22.173
I was little,
I wasn't very strong.

10:23.830 --> 10:27.903
I remember, like,
for two summers,
every opportunity I had,

10:27.903 --> 10:30.146
I would beg my dad to get me
a wakeboard.

10:34.944 --> 10:38.499
Parks needs 93.05
to overtake...

10:38.499 --> 10:40.053
I'd see the Parks Bonifays,

10:40.053 --> 10:42.089
Shaun Murrays, Darin Shapiros
of this world

10:42.089 --> 10:45.230
wakeboarding and competing
on TV.

10:45.230 --> 10:49.718
Steps it up. There's the s-bend
That's a beautiful trick.

10:49.718 --> 10:53.756
Just as surfing had
influenced skateboarding
and snowboarding,

10:53.756 --> 10:56.932
it was those sports
that inspired
wakeboarding pioneers

10:56.932 --> 10:59.659
like Jimmy Redmon
and Tony Finn.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.799
Fast-forward
to the early 2000s,

11:01.799 --> 11:04.802
wakeboarding was at the height
of its popularity.

11:04.802 --> 11:10.290
Pro-tours, big cash prizes,
and TV broadcasts
of renowned events.

11:10.290 --> 11:13.051
People were seeing wakeboarding
for the first time.

11:13.051 --> 11:14.777
And they were inspired by it.

11:17.331 --> 11:20.438
I just water-skied everyday.
Trained, three events.

11:20.438 --> 11:22.233
I loved it,
but I wanted to wakeboard.

11:22.233 --> 11:24.649
That's where my head
already was.

11:50.399 --> 11:52.573
After all those years
of begging,

11:52.573 --> 11:54.299
I got home and there's

11:54.299 --> 11:58.476
a Liquid Force Mini... 121
sitting on the kitchen table,

11:58.476 --> 12:00.236
and that was going to be
my first wakeboard.

12:28.575 --> 12:30.439
And then, there you have Raph.

12:30.439 --> 12:31.785
You're a little kid.
What do you do?

12:31.785 --> 12:33.753
You watch your older brother.
What is he doing?

13:15.898 --> 13:18.142
When we were younger, like,
I always looked up to Oli

13:18.142 --> 13:20.282
as my older brother
and my hero.

13:20.282 --> 13:22.215
So when he, like...

13:22.215 --> 13:24.804
I have always wanted to be
super short, just because
Oli was short.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.219
I thought that was really cool.

13:26.219 --> 13:28.428
And that kinda shows, like, how...

13:28.428 --> 13:31.258
like how bad I wanted to be
just like him when I was younger.

13:31.258 --> 13:32.604
Yeah.

13:32.604 --> 13:33.674
Let's go, Raph!

13:55.800 --> 13:56.836
Yeah!

13:59.321 --> 14:01.185
He was just on a whole
different level...

14:01.185 --> 14:04.291
...and he was so good.

14:04.291 --> 14:08.226
I was always, like, a huge fan
of him. He was a badass kid.

14:10.919 --> 14:13.887
Raph, he's more
in his head than Oli.

14:13.887 --> 14:19.168
Oli is very outgoing,
and he lives outside his body.

14:19.168 --> 14:22.931
Where Raph was much more quiet,
much more subdued.

14:22.931 --> 14:26.520
In a way,
he's the exact opposite
of Oli in personalities.

14:39.602 --> 14:41.777
Raph would have
all of the tricks

14:41.777 --> 14:44.159
to be able to make finals
and rival these guys.

14:44.159 --> 14:45.919
We just couldn't
put it together.

15:11.807 --> 15:14.430
Raph and I came up
at the same time.

15:14.430 --> 15:17.261
I remember he could so
something. I was like, "Crap!
This guy has me good."

15:19.125 --> 15:21.058
I was, like, always so worried,
but then I stopped worrying,

15:21.058 --> 15:23.543
because he just kept falling.

15:23.543 --> 15:25.407
Robert Soven in first.

15:25.407 --> 15:27.961
Raphael Derome in second.
Take a bow, guys.

15:30.722 --> 15:34.968
And those are your boys
finalists right here,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:34.968 --> 15:36.211
Fantastic!

15:36.832 --> 15:38.765
Another future...

15:38.765 --> 15:41.941
We got...

15:41.941 --> 15:43.943
Yeah, I remember
the first time I met Marc.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.599
I was probably 9 years old.

15:45.599 --> 15:47.981
We just shared
a lot of really good memories

15:47.981 --> 15:49.776
and had a strong connection...

15:49.776 --> 15:53.504
um, everything I have,
like a big part of it is due
to him,

15:53.504 --> 15:55.402
and that's never
going to change.

15:56.024 --> 15:56.990
Yeah, Marc.

16:00.166 --> 16:01.995
Raph really had issues
in his head.

16:01.995 --> 16:04.239
Like, he just
couldn't focus properly.

16:04.239 --> 16:06.241
Um, he wasn't riding smart

16:06.241 --> 16:08.277
when it was about time
for competition.

16:14.352 --> 16:17.528
You know, the Deromes
were a very competitive family.

16:17.528 --> 16:20.841
And Julien, the father,
coming from a karate background,

16:20.841 --> 16:22.464
from a water ski background,

16:22.464 --> 16:25.053
you know, where actually
the only way to prove yourself

16:25.053 --> 16:26.364
is to win something?

16:26.364 --> 16:29.022
Like, Raph felt that.

16:29.022 --> 16:33.785
And this is where I came in,
and I could talk to him
and calm him.

16:33.785 --> 16:35.787
He slowly opened to me.

16:35.787 --> 16:39.170
And that is something that
Raph isn't doing a lot of time,

16:39.170 --> 16:42.725
to open to people easily,
and his dad saw that.

17:02.400 --> 17:05.058
That family, well, they were
crazy welcoming,

17:05.058 --> 17:07.543
so that's how I felt
dealing with the Deromes.

17:07.543 --> 17:09.752
They were like a second family
to me.

17:45.064 --> 17:49.206
I guess my dad gave me
so much fuel.

17:49.206 --> 17:51.587
He obviously is my role model,

17:51.587 --> 17:56.454
and he also showed me
how to reach a goal.

17:56.454 --> 18:00.769
And no matter what the goal
was, you would always end
up doing it.

18:00.769 --> 18:02.391
And that's something I kind
of strive for.

18:02.391 --> 18:04.773
Like, no matter what's the goal
I set for myself,

18:04.773 --> 18:07.086
I'll do what it takes
and I'll make sure it works.

18:15.991 --> 18:17.372
As long as I can remember,

18:17.372 --> 18:19.236
when I'd go on the boat
with my dad in the backyard,

18:19.236 --> 18:22.204
he'd come home from work,
set himself up to go slalom ski,

18:22.204 --> 18:25.242
And then you could hear
from a distance...

18:25.242 --> 18:28.555
Whether it was a boat
or a jet ski,
or whatever it was,

18:28.555 --> 18:30.937
it would come in,
screw up the lake,

18:30.937 --> 18:33.457
and he'd always say
under his breath,

18:33.457 --> 18:35.976
"One day I'll have
my own fucking private lake."

18:38.496 --> 18:42.086
My dad always said,
"If I had a million dollars,

18:42.086 --> 18:44.399
I would build
my own private lake."

18:45.331 --> 18:46.918
He never got
the million dollars,

18:46.918 --> 18:48.403
but at one point, he said,

18:48.403 --> 18:50.267
"It's one thing to believe it,

18:50.267 --> 18:54.167
but those thoughts
have to become actions
so that you get to your goal."

19:10.321 --> 19:12.427
Yes!

19:12.427 --> 19:17.777
His only pleasure in his
life was to have his one
slalom run every day.

19:17.777 --> 19:21.125
"I've worked so hard in my life.
I want my run."

19:21.125 --> 19:24.128
"I'm going to do it for me,
and then for the family."

19:27.166 --> 19:28.339
How was that?

20:05.583 --> 20:08.207
So he found some of his friends

20:08.207 --> 20:10.312
who could come
and help him build his lake.

20:12.935 --> 20:15.214
He says, like, "Hey, you come
and dig out my lake,

20:29.918 --> 20:31.816
Watching someone do that,

20:31.816 --> 20:35.199
that gave us, like,
such a good example,
something to follow.

20:35.199 --> 20:37.512
So I think that Raph,
seeing that was like,

20:37.512 --> 20:41.550
"Okay, if I want something,
I believe that I can do that."

20:41.550 --> 20:44.277
He just followed
in my dad's footsteps.

20:51.319 --> 20:55.081
For the 2006
World Championship, all
the major players were there.

20:55.081 --> 20:58.636
Like, for Raph, that meant
Bob Soven, Harley Clifford.

21:00.673 --> 21:03.400
All the kids that were there,
they were from Orlando,

21:03.400 --> 21:05.574
and Harley,
he was from Australia,

21:05.574 --> 21:07.576
so he was riding the
never-ending summer.

21:09.682 --> 21:12.443
Raph, he was intimidated
by them.

21:12.443 --> 21:15.826
They were in magazines,
there was a hype around them.

21:15.826 --> 21:19.864
And Raph is a little French
Canadian from Quebec that
comes in.

21:19.864 --> 21:22.522
Yeah! Go, Raph!

21:22.522 --> 21:26.699
I remember I'm holding
the dad cam, and here goes
my little brother,

21:26.699 --> 21:29.426
and he just
absolutely lays it down.

21:30.116 --> 21:31.117
Yeah.

21:33.671 --> 21:34.741
Yeah!

21:34.741 --> 21:36.087
As French Canadians,

21:36.087 --> 21:38.780
we have three months of summer
and wakeboarding.

21:38.780 --> 21:43.302
So, that was like a huge upset,
because he was the underdog.

22:16.438 --> 22:20.166
The new world champion
in the boys division,

22:20.166 --> 22:23.065
from Canada, Raphael Derome!

22:26.034 --> 22:27.622
Following
the world championship,

22:27.622 --> 22:29.658
we had to fly back to Orlando.

22:29.658 --> 22:31.626
Amassault was getting on.

22:31.626 --> 22:37.217
Raph flew there with a new
confidence, being stamped
as the world champion.

22:40.220 --> 22:45.329
There was a new company coming
out for the industry,
and it was called Ronix.

22:45.329 --> 22:50.196
They had the best guys, you
know, Danny Harf,
Chad Sharpe,

22:50.196 --> 22:53.751
and Parks Bonifay
was already a legend back then.

22:58.446 --> 23:01.518
The Amassault was
a grassroot contest that we did,

23:01.518 --> 23:03.520
where everyone could come out,
ride all the new gear...

23:03.520 --> 23:06.108
...ride their gear or whatever,
but we just went in the boat,

23:06.108 --> 23:08.352
and they went out
and we were able to observe.

23:10.285 --> 23:13.392
And then, whoever won
the Amassault, we would, like,
take 'em on a trip,

23:13.392 --> 23:15.773
and kinda like
get 'em into the start
of the team.

23:18.086 --> 23:21.814
If you could be the kid
that would be taken
under that wing,

23:21.814 --> 23:25.507
and pushed onto the biggest
marketing platform of the sport,

23:25.507 --> 23:27.129
it was
going to change everything.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.201
So there were amateurs from
all ages.

23:30.201 --> 23:32.652
I was there.
I was hoping to be the one.

23:34.274 --> 23:35.103
Yeah!

23:35.897 --> 23:37.554
But guess who was the one?

23:42.904 --> 23:44.526
Yeah!

23:44.526 --> 23:46.114
We're sitting around a table
with Paul O'Brien,

23:46.114 --> 23:47.874
the owner of Ronix Wakeboard,

23:47.874 --> 23:52.431
and Paul is talking to Raph,
and he is asking him questions.

23:52.431 --> 23:55.019
And Raph is just sitting there,

23:55.019 --> 23:59.783
just being, like,
overwhelmed of riding
with his favorite rider.

24:03.511 --> 24:05.547
When Paul O'Brien came to me
and said,

24:05.547 --> 24:08.550
"You're the sixth member
of the Ronix team,"

24:08.550 --> 24:10.207
it was sort of like
I was in a dream or something.

24:10.207 --> 24:13.348
Like, I couldn't believe, like,
it was really happening.

24:15.315 --> 24:17.041
Raph was becoming his own,

24:17.041 --> 24:20.113
and I moved to The Projects,
which was a wakeboard camp,

24:20.113 --> 24:23.772
which had the best rail park in
the world at the time...

24:24.773 --> 24:26.603
to start coaching there.

24:26.603 --> 24:28.397
That's when we met Pat
for the first time.

24:30.676 --> 24:32.540
Sweet Pat, take one. Mark.

24:34.093 --> 24:38.304
I remember we saw a video
of Byerly hitting docks...

24:38.304 --> 24:41.790
...and all we wanted to do
is just hit docks, slide docks.

24:44.206 --> 24:48.107
We did have rails in our sport,
in our events.

24:48.107 --> 24:51.282
So we went out and built
our own rail event
called The Carnival.

24:51.282 --> 24:54.631
Found this property,
put all the rails here.

24:54.631 --> 24:57.772
Didn't pass the opportunity up
to just continually
hit the rails,

24:57.772 --> 24:59.498
and we never pulled them out.

24:59.498 --> 25:04.468
And eventually, we opened up
The Projects, a rail park,
in 1999.

25:07.747 --> 25:09.473
Thank God we had that,
because, you know,

25:09.473 --> 25:12.683
he did it for the riders
and he did it for the sport,

25:12.683 --> 25:14.685
and his passion
towards building rails.

25:14.685 --> 25:17.930
Pat was the first one to come
and tell us how to do it.

25:17.930 --> 25:21.554
From my perspective, I think it
impacted wakeboarding...

25:21.554 --> 25:26.041
...because, Pat,
he was selfless.

25:26.041 --> 25:30.563
He still continues to do it to
this day, and people don't
really know who he is.

25:32.151 --> 25:33.670
Pat definitely influenced
Raph a lot.

25:33.670 --> 25:37.570
He saw something in Raph
from a really young age,

25:37.570 --> 25:39.986
when he started
coming to Florida
and ride with me.

25:39.986 --> 25:42.817
And year after year,
he would see his progression,

25:42.817 --> 25:44.681
and how he would develop.

25:44.681 --> 25:48.270
He really pushed Raph
to keep going with it.

25:50.307 --> 25:54.069
When Marc wasn't around
to keep Raph on that path,

25:54.069 --> 25:56.865
well, Pat really did that.

25:56.865 --> 26:00.593
My first impression of Raph
wasn't much of an impression.

26:00.593 --> 26:03.700
It was,
"He's your quiet
little brother."

26:03.700 --> 26:07.013
But riding wise,
Raph's a different person,

26:07.013 --> 26:09.533
because Raph has a focus,

26:09.533 --> 26:13.744
you know, a really, really
strong focus.

26:13.744 --> 26:18.162
From the beginning,
I backed Raph,
because I knew who he was.

26:18.162 --> 26:23.685
I knew what he was
trying to accomplish.
I knew his work ethic.

26:23.685 --> 26:27.137
Rails had started to be
really popular in the
wakeboarding industry,

26:27.137 --> 26:30.347
and Julien, he hated rails.

26:34.627 --> 26:35.973
Whoa!

26:47.778 --> 26:52.058
So, Julien,
he finally swallowed it.
"They need to hit rails?"

26:52.058 --> 26:54.785
"I am going to build them
the best rails ever."

27:02.482 --> 27:06.555
Raph was riding for Ronix,
because, you know,
he won the Amassault,

27:06.555 --> 27:08.903
but there was something
that wasn't working,

27:08.903 --> 27:13.183
like, Raph wasn't happy.

27:13.183 --> 27:17.014
Growing up,
like, I always felt like
I had the impostor syndrome.

27:17.014 --> 27:20.017
It felt like
my personality was not fitting.

27:20.017 --> 27:22.779
It felt like
I need to be extroverted.

27:22.779 --> 27:26.023
I needed to party
with everyone,
like, it's going to be tough,

27:26.023 --> 27:29.958
like I'm just not that guy,
and I knew it really early on.

27:29.958 --> 27:33.721
He was riding with his idols,
and he was still a kid.

27:33.721 --> 27:37.759
And at that time, those guys,
you know, they are, like,
in their 20s.

27:37.759 --> 27:42.661
They like to have
fun at night and stuff,
and it is perfectly normal.

27:42.661 --> 27:45.525
It's got to be hard to go on
a shoot and trying
to get to know everyone

27:45.525 --> 27:49.115
when you're so young.
You're thrown into the mix,
right into it.

27:49.115 --> 27:52.636
And there's a bit of a
language barrier there too.

27:52.636 --> 27:56.778
Raph was the definition
of what is a real professional.

27:56.778 --> 27:59.885
Like, for him,
he took everything so seriously.

27:59.885 --> 28:01.887
Even at such a young age,

28:01.887 --> 28:05.373
like, he would go to bed early,
he would train,

28:05.373 --> 28:07.824
he would be on the trampoline
all the time,

28:07.824 --> 28:11.966
and he felt like an impostor
on the team.

28:11.966 --> 28:16.556
So that's where I decided
maybe something else
was better for him.

28:16.556 --> 28:20.319
And something else
was Liquid Force.

28:20.319 --> 28:25.324
Raph would have never let me
do this, because he is faithful.

28:25.324 --> 28:31.399
We received the boards
the next day, all the models
for Raph to try.

28:31.399 --> 28:34.298
I remember being
in the boat with him
when he tried them all,

28:34.298 --> 28:39.614
and there was nothing
that was working.
Everything was shit.

28:39.614 --> 28:43.238
I kept the best board
for the last, and he rode good.

28:43.238 --> 28:45.896
And I kind of saw
a little smile on his face.

28:45.896 --> 28:49.831
He didn't know it,
but the deal
was pretty much done.

28:52.213 --> 28:53.593
I always loved Raph.

28:53.593 --> 28:56.113
You know,
I was definitely bummed
to see him go.

28:56.113 --> 28:58.840
You know, as soon as
we basically let Raph go...

28:58.840 --> 29:01.740
...is when he really
started to blow up.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.950
Yeah, I mean, bad timing on our
part, but you can't win them
all, I guess.

29:07.435 --> 29:10.645
Hey, my name's Raph Derome,
and I ride for Liquid Force.

29:15.512 --> 29:19.965
We are one of the only brands
that did not come from
a water ski background.

29:19.965 --> 29:22.243
Tony and Jimmy grew up surfing.

29:25.177 --> 29:27.179
Just skiing seemed boring to me.

29:27.179 --> 29:29.112
Every time I'd swing out,
and lay into a turn,

29:29.112 --> 29:31.079
I'd drop a hand, I'd come into
the wake...

29:31.079 --> 29:33.806
...and do an off the lip on
skis, and they'd go, "What are
you doing, man?"

29:33.806 --> 29:35.601
I'd go, "I'm trying to surf
the ski."

29:37.016 --> 29:38.638
So, I had this idea,

29:38.638 --> 29:40.468
you know, I wanted to
make a miniature board,

29:40.468 --> 29:43.195
and put foot straps on it,
like a scaled-down surfboard.

29:44.921 --> 29:46.439
It planted the seed.

29:46.439 --> 29:48.545
"Man, this could be like a sport
one day."

29:48.545 --> 29:51.686
"This is rad. This is way more
fun than waterskiing."

29:53.101 --> 29:56.864
We were more about
trying to have fun, not contest.

29:56.864 --> 30:00.799
And I think Raph just fit in
with that, you know, that idea.

30:02.870 --> 30:06.770
Raph, his personality
came on top, finally.

30:06.770 --> 30:09.462
He wanted to be himself.

30:09.462 --> 30:13.846
Raph shows up with these neon
orange and pink shorts

30:13.846 --> 30:15.814
that would end above the knee.

30:18.333 --> 30:21.785
Up until that stage
in wakeboarding,
the first thing you did,

30:21.785 --> 30:23.683
if you wakeboarded before,
when you got off,

30:23.683 --> 30:25.858
is you pull your shorts
over your knees and cover them.

30:27.515 --> 30:30.000
I thought it was just going
to be a summer joke.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.313
And then we show up at
Wakestock Canada,

30:32.313 --> 30:36.489
where everyone that is someone
in wakeboarding was there,

30:36.489 --> 30:40.908
and the whole time I'm
thinking, "Is he going to
pull at his shorts?"

30:44.773 --> 30:47.811
From now on, Raph was rocking
the short shorts.

30:47.811 --> 30:49.537
Everybody was only talking
about that.

30:50.918 --> 30:53.023
I wasn't a fan, but it's funny,

30:53.023 --> 30:56.302
because I love short shorts
right now, and that's all
I want to wear.

30:56.302 --> 30:57.994
So I have to go back and say,

30:57.994 --> 31:00.513
"Raph, I apologize for making
fun of you
for the short shorts."

31:03.723 --> 31:07.348
I realized that,
hey, being yourself will get
you there still,

31:07.348 --> 31:09.522
and that was like
a really strong moment for me.

31:09.522 --> 31:12.560
Realizing, like, being you
will make you different.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.458
It's gonna work to your advantage.

31:26.436 --> 31:29.922
As Raph's
wakeboarding style evolved,
so did the sport.

31:30.647 --> 31:32.338
Full-sized cable parks,

31:32.338 --> 31:34.962
where connected towers did
the towing instead of boats,

31:34.962 --> 31:36.722
were already popular in Europe.

31:38.586 --> 31:41.623
By 2010, cable parks
were making wakeboarding

31:41.623 --> 31:45.110
more accessible
and affordable
in North America.

31:45.110 --> 31:48.009
But the bigger breakthrough
for wakeboarding came

31:48.009 --> 31:50.460
when cable parks got smaller.

31:52.807 --> 31:56.604
Sesitec, a German cable company,
invented a system that,

31:56.604 --> 32:00.263
instead of going around
the lake, you would go
back and forth.

32:02.299 --> 32:04.025
We saw it at Wakestock,

32:04.025 --> 32:07.718
and my dad being the person
he is, was like,

32:07.718 --> 32:10.273
"If they're going to leave it
there, someone is
going to use it.

32:10.273 --> 32:11.274
Might as well take it."

32:12.102 --> 32:13.621
So we ended up taking it.

32:19.454 --> 32:20.904
And then, from that,

32:20.904 --> 32:22.699
the creativity
in the sport of wakeboarding

32:22.699 --> 32:24.045
just went through the roof.

32:24.045 --> 32:25.909
And, I think Raph was
one of the huge drivers of that.

32:34.331 --> 32:36.575
We'd get there
and watch him ride,

32:36.575 --> 32:39.819
and he would always have
different tricks,
different combinations

32:39.819 --> 32:41.269
that no one
had ever seen before.

32:41.269 --> 32:42.995
And we rode with him every day.

32:42.995 --> 32:47.137
That's when I realized
what he was doing.

32:48.863 --> 32:51.314
Just, one morning,
no one could drive me that day,

32:51.314 --> 32:54.110
so I figured if I pulled
the remote control far enough,

32:54.110 --> 32:55.835
I could start myself.

32:57.458 --> 32:59.529
I just remember,
like, it's quiet

32:59.529 --> 33:01.117
it's early in the morning,
there's no one.

33:01.117 --> 33:03.464
I'm just carving
and, like, screaming by myself.

33:03.464 --> 33:05.121
Like, it's probably one
of the first time

33:05.121 --> 33:07.192
that someone was wakeboarding
by themself.

33:09.056 --> 33:12.507
I get to the lake and Raph
was already, who knows,

33:12.507 --> 33:15.372
two hours of riding deep
into his day already,

33:15.372 --> 33:19.066
and spending time with himself
to learn all these tricks.

33:25.072 --> 33:26.625
It was like
a blank piece of paper.

33:26.625 --> 33:29.559
I could do whatever I wanted,
like, it was new.

33:58.174 --> 33:59.830
There's only one guy who presses

33:59.830 --> 34:01.591
a couple of buttons
and you can ride.

34:01.591 --> 34:04.076
It's like going to
a ski mountain and get in
the chair lift,

34:04.076 --> 34:07.045
do as many laps as you want
until your body
can't take it anymore.

34:07.045 --> 34:09.426
Some people would do one or two
rides and be done.

34:09.426 --> 34:12.705
Me and Raph would make ten
rides in a day
and still want more.

34:18.194 --> 34:20.955
Couple of years after
the Sesitec 2.0 blows up,

34:20.955 --> 34:23.061
there's contests
all over Europe.

34:28.342 --> 34:30.689
Contests like
Red Bull Wake the Line,

34:30.689 --> 34:38.352
they were massive for System
2.0, and pushing that side of
rail riding.

34:38.352 --> 34:42.563
Wake the Line was the first,
like, big contest that we had.

34:42.563 --> 34:45.531
That was like the first time we
were actually, like, on stage...

34:45.531 --> 34:47.499
...people there, television.

34:50.743 --> 34:53.194
The riding that came out of it,
the media that came out of it,

34:53.194 --> 34:56.853
everything about it
was just bigger.

34:56.853 --> 35:00.615
We go to Wake the Line,
where Raph, he's not invited,

35:00.615 --> 35:04.343
but he gets an invite through
Pat Panakos.

35:05.793 --> 35:08.347
Someone got hurt and
couldn't ride.

35:08.347 --> 35:10.487
And at that point,
there's an opportunity.

35:10.487 --> 35:13.732
"Hey, you know, let him in."

35:13.732 --> 35:15.941
"I'll put my name on it.
He's not gonna let me down."

35:18.599 --> 35:23.362
I remember that
conversation with Sean
Dishman putting it on me,

35:23.362 --> 35:25.226
"You better not be wrong,

35:25.226 --> 35:30.438
because we're basically putting
in a no-namer in a main event."

35:30.438 --> 35:34.028
It is a family battle royale
to start off Wake the Line.

35:34.028 --> 35:37.618
The Derome brothers going
head-to-head in round
number one.

35:37.618 --> 35:39.896
When we did the brackets,

35:39.896 --> 35:42.416
I had to pick a name
out of a bag.

35:42.416 --> 35:47.006
So I picked my brother's name,
so I knew what I was in for.

35:47.006 --> 35:51.010
Oli's really hard
to ride against, because the
way he sets up his run,

35:51.010 --> 35:55.014
he is not going to fall.
Like, he is very,
very consistent.

35:55.014 --> 35:57.810
Oli Derome
coming out
of the blocks firing,

35:57.810 --> 35:59.812
laying down an immaculate run

35:59.812 --> 36:03.540
and seriously piling the
pressure for his younger
brother to follow.

36:03.540 --> 36:05.611
Here comes Raph. Toeside...

36:05.611 --> 36:08.027
and takes a tumble,
not managing to ride away.

36:08.027 --> 36:11.997
That is going to be first blood
to Derome Sr.

36:11.997 --> 36:14.102
I could feel the pressure on
my shoulders.

36:14.102 --> 36:17.761
And competing against
your brother kind of adds
a whole lot more to it.

36:20.695 --> 36:23.284
As if there wasn't enough
pressure on Raph already,

36:23.284 --> 36:27.702
Oli goes and scores his
second run again.

36:27.702 --> 36:29.946
I know if I make a mistake,
then it's over.

36:29.946 --> 36:33.467
I'm going back home to
Quebec with no invitations
in the future for me.

36:35.469 --> 36:39.162
Front-lip, front-board,
all over the tail.

36:39.162 --> 36:42.061
Final trick.
It's a big old spinner.
It's a 720.

36:42.061 --> 36:45.444
And even with a butt check,
that is going to be
one a piece.

36:45.444 --> 36:48.792
We now have a competition on
our hands.

36:49.828 --> 36:51.312
Last round.

36:51.312 --> 36:54.522
I'm going first and
land every single trick
I wanted.

36:57.111 --> 37:00.010
There is a toeside, backside 7.

37:00.010 --> 37:01.805
Absolutely smoking it.

37:02.737 --> 37:04.256
Tough act to follow.

37:04.256 --> 37:06.327
Oli coming out
the blocks second
this time around.

37:06.327 --> 37:09.365
Backside 3 to down-rail.

37:09.365 --> 37:11.367
Coming into his last trick,
he's done this every time.

37:11.367 --> 37:12.437
Can he do it again?

37:13.265 --> 37:14.404
Oli goes down.

37:16.303 --> 37:19.582
When he fell, I knew
I had taken it.

37:19.582 --> 37:22.032
One's gotta go ahead
and one's got to stay behind,

37:22.032 --> 37:24.518
and that's like the cruel
thing about it.

37:27.106 --> 37:29.074
Now that he beat me,
I hope he wins.

37:30.040 --> 37:33.251
He better win. He better win.

37:33.251 --> 37:36.875
That switch in his head
of delivering under pressure,

37:36.875 --> 37:38.117
that was far gone.

37:38.117 --> 37:39.705
That Raph was left behind,

37:39.705 --> 37:43.261
and, you know, the modern Raph
could deliver under pressure.

37:49.267 --> 37:51.061
No joke,
I got that gut feeling like,

37:51.061 --> 37:53.788
"Oh, man. This kid's gonna take
all my stuff."

37:56.964 --> 38:00.243
Nico von Lerchenfeld in play
against Raph Derome.

38:00.243 --> 38:01.796
Can he be the one to stop him?

38:03.419 --> 38:04.937
Here comes Raph.

38:04.937 --> 38:08.216
Oh, my!
That is a colossal ollie
onto that rail.

38:09.528 --> 38:11.944
It's the 900,
and he rides it away.

38:16.432 --> 38:17.743
It turned out awesome.

38:17.743 --> 38:20.677
And like I said,
I never had a doubt.

38:22.714 --> 38:26.338
Raphael Derome! Wow!

38:30.377 --> 38:33.069
You and your brother
got matched up
for first heat.

38:33.069 --> 38:35.416
And it was the first time I saw
the Deromes go back to back.

38:35.416 --> 38:37.280
Yeah, it was the first time
I was against my brother

38:37.280 --> 38:39.040
in an international event.

38:39.040 --> 38:41.836
At first, I was like, "It
doesn't matter. It had to
happen."

38:41.836 --> 38:43.631
But then right before
we rode out,

38:43.631 --> 38:46.324
I was like,
"Yeah, you're right.
It sucks to be against you."

38:51.501 --> 38:54.849
When I was younger, I was
probably 13,

38:54.849 --> 38:57.956
I was competing
against Oli at nationals,

38:57.956 --> 38:59.820
and I remember thinking like,

38:59.820 --> 39:02.823
"I hope he falls, or doesn't
do too good," or
something like that.

39:02.823 --> 39:04.134
And I remember he fell.

39:05.446 --> 39:07.655
I ended up, like,
crying, by myself,

39:07.655 --> 39:10.002
because I was sad for him
that he didn't win.

39:10.002 --> 39:12.350
That's the best way I can
explain the rivalry we had.

39:20.047 --> 39:23.533
When we were kids, the rivalry
was on the trampoline.

39:25.432 --> 39:28.158
Then, eventually,
we started competing
against each other,

39:28.158 --> 39:31.403
especially in rails.
And Wake the Line,

39:31.403 --> 39:34.958
the second time we went there,
I don't know how the odds are,

39:34.958 --> 39:37.064
but we went head-to-head
first round again.

39:38.341 --> 39:40.378
It's a Derome deja vu.

39:40.378 --> 39:41.827
The brothers go head-to-head

39:41.827 --> 39:44.312
in the first round of this
Wake the Line yet again.

39:45.521 --> 39:47.661
But will that indy backside

39:47.661 --> 39:49.973
along with rest of a clean
run from Oli be enough

39:49.973 --> 39:52.182
to get ahead of his
younger brother?

39:52.182 --> 39:55.013
Left foot forward. He comes in,
rotates backside, lands--

39:55.013 --> 39:58.119
Oh, my!
That is one almighty press.

39:59.431 --> 40:01.329
Here comes Raph.
Final hit off the kicker.

40:01.329 --> 40:03.401
He goes... 900.

40:03.401 --> 40:04.678
Oh, my gosh!

40:18.243 --> 40:21.833
That year, the format included
a Last Chance Qualifier.

40:21.833 --> 40:26.596
So I was able to work my way up
back into finals.

40:26.596 --> 40:28.460
We have Oli Derome
out of the water.

40:28.460 --> 40:30.600
This is our super final.

40:30.600 --> 40:33.707
There see this clean,
consistent riding yet again.

40:38.470 --> 40:40.438
With a banger of a 7.

40:46.167 --> 40:49.481
Up until I was 19 years old, we
shared a room, my brother and I.

40:50.413 --> 40:52.070
And when we were really young,

40:52.070 --> 40:54.486
we'd talk about wakeboarding
going to sleep.

40:54.486 --> 40:57.075
And we always had the dream
that one day we'd be pros

40:57.075 --> 41:00.423
and we'd be on a podium
together, and we did it.

41:00.423 --> 41:04.945
The new Wake the Line,
Raph Derome!

41:08.293 --> 41:09.915
Oli was, like, a phenomenal wakeboarder.

41:09.915 --> 41:11.572
Like, he's incredible.

41:11.572 --> 41:14.472
Probably the most underrated
wakeboarder that I've
ever seen.

41:26.587 --> 41:28.658
And Raph, he would get
all the big sponsors,

41:28.658 --> 41:31.592
and win the events,
and it looks so much easier
for him.

41:33.525 --> 41:36.355
When your brother is getting,
like, the things that you want,

41:36.355 --> 41:38.496
that must have been tough
to see, you know?

41:44.225 --> 41:47.401
His skill was almost clouded
by Raph's talent.

41:47.401 --> 41:50.542
I don't know if he has
any animosity towards Raph,

41:50.542 --> 41:52.889
for, like, stealing some of his thunder.

41:55.513 --> 41:59.724
Truthfully, I was always
dreaming of having the results

41:59.724 --> 42:01.588
and the accolades that my
brother got.

42:02.381 --> 42:03.762
I didn't get them.

42:03.762 --> 42:05.626
And it was a little frustrating,

42:05.626 --> 42:08.353
because, you know, I was used
to being the bigger brother,

42:08.353 --> 42:11.425
and I was used to being
the one getting the attention,

42:11.425 --> 42:14.670
because I am, you know,
loud and excited.

42:14.670 --> 42:16.361
But at the same time,

42:16.361 --> 42:19.709
If anyone was going to do it
that way, I wanted it
to be him.

42:48.669 --> 42:52.052
The original dream
that was, sort of, passed on

42:52.052 --> 42:54.330
from my father to me,

42:54.330 --> 42:58.817
I was able to chase that dream
of being a pro wakeboarder.

42:58.817 --> 43:01.199
But for me to be a part
of his journey,

43:01.199 --> 43:04.305
and for him to be able to reach
those goals,

43:04.305 --> 43:08.206
it's just as sweet as
if I would have been able to
do it,

43:08.206 --> 43:12.072
because, you know,
he's my baby brother.

43:18.975 --> 43:21.599
He was winning cable
and boat events,

43:21.599 --> 43:24.291
which, at the time, was pretty
unheard of.

43:24.291 --> 43:27.501
And then,
I heard about his injury.

43:27.501 --> 43:29.227
He injured his elbow.

43:37.925 --> 43:40.618
Broken bones heal,
ligaments heal,

43:40.618 --> 43:46.589
but definitely, when there's
any internal, that stuff gets
really, really scary.

43:46.589 --> 43:51.629
Sometimes, those big injuries
can affect your mindset a lot.

43:53.492 --> 43:55.633
You don't want to see that
happen to any rider,

43:55.633 --> 43:57.807
but especially like one that's
in his prime,

43:57.807 --> 43:59.740
and starting to make
an impact on the sport,

43:59.740 --> 44:01.293
like in the way that Raph was.

44:04.469 --> 44:06.057
The doctor was telling me that

44:06.057 --> 44:08.128
there is a chance it had
infected the bone...

44:08.128 --> 44:09.957
...and there is a chance
we can cut off the arm,

44:09.957 --> 44:11.683
depending on how bad it is.

44:11.683 --> 44:13.685
So I remember not
sleeping very well that night.

44:13.685 --> 44:16.412
Just thinking what my life
would be after that,

44:16.412 --> 44:18.207
if I don't have
my elbow anymore.

44:33.671 --> 44:36.363
I know the boys are on the road,
they're winching in Toronto.

44:36.363 --> 44:39.815
He sees this spot that he
goes for,

44:39.815 --> 44:43.853
and it just doesn't go
accordingly, and
smashes his elbow.

44:46.684 --> 44:49.894
We all think he's going to be
fine. He finished the
season, he competed.

44:51.861 --> 44:53.932
He would always say that
something felt wrong.

45:08.913 --> 45:12.571
I remember having him on the
phone and saying
it was really strange,

45:12.571 --> 45:13.607
it wasn't bleeding.

45:15.540 --> 45:18.439
That's when he realized
that there's something
serious happening.

45:28.277 --> 45:31.936
First of all, Raph had
a ripped tricep tendon nobody
knew about.

45:33.869 --> 45:36.595
And then the infection
had developed into his blood,

45:36.595 --> 45:37.769
so he had a staph infection.

45:40.599 --> 45:42.809
At one point,
they even said, like,

45:42.809 --> 45:45.950
"We might have
to do something more serious."

45:49.919 --> 45:52.991
The thought of him
possibly losing a forearm,

45:52.991 --> 45:54.855
that's when everyone lost it.

46:31.443 --> 46:34.101
He was definitely scared
from that situation

46:34.101 --> 46:36.414
because nobody is really used
to being in a hospital

46:36.414 --> 46:38.657
and being in that vibe
of "everybody is scared

46:38.657 --> 46:41.695
and everybody is mad."
It really got to him.

46:43.801 --> 46:47.943
It was strange
because I'm with a new sponsor.

46:47.943 --> 46:49.220
I'm thriving.

46:49.220 --> 46:53.120
I am landing Wake to Wake 1080s.

46:53.120 --> 46:55.433
In hindsight, I wish I would
have been there more.

46:55.433 --> 47:00.645
But I was so focused on my
career and I was talking to him,

47:00.645 --> 47:04.200
but not as much as I should have
and that I wish I did.

47:17.938 --> 47:21.666
Waking up,
the doctor was telling me that
the infection was really bad.

47:21.666 --> 47:27.327
But it had not completely
entered my bones and they
reattached my tricep tendon.

47:27.327 --> 47:29.432
and I was able to get away
with it.

47:56.874 --> 47:58.047
Set?

47:58.047 --> 47:59.635
- All right?
- Yeah.

48:07.332 --> 48:09.369
There was nothing guaranteed
for me at that point

48:09.369 --> 48:12.855
because I had only two-thirds
of my tendon left.

48:12.855 --> 48:15.030
I can remember the doctor
telling me straight up,

48:15.030 --> 48:17.032
you have to find something
else to do

48:17.032 --> 48:20.518
because you're not going to
be able to wakeboard
anymore with your arm.

48:20.518 --> 48:22.485
I just felt like I needed to
catch up.

48:22.485 --> 48:24.246
I got really focused.

48:24.246 --> 48:29.182
Every energy I had was directed
towards, you know,
getting better,

48:29.182 --> 48:32.702
and for some reason,
I just knew, there's no way.

48:32.702 --> 48:34.394
I had this vision of like,

48:34.394 --> 48:36.914
"I'm going to be okay,
don't listen,
just do your thing."

48:57.969 --> 49:00.696
A couple of months later,
I was able to ride with one arm

49:00.696 --> 49:02.870
and slowly
putting some pressure
on my arm.

49:04.562 --> 49:07.047
I am starting to see the light
at the end of the tunnel, like,

49:07.047 --> 49:08.738
"I think I can do this,

49:08.738 --> 49:11.500
I think I'll be able to
wakeboard at the same
level I was."

49:24.168 --> 49:27.481
Looking back now,
it's a blessing in disguise
knowing that

49:27.481 --> 49:29.621
that was a breaking
point for me,

49:29.621 --> 49:34.937
where I picked myself up from
the floor and built something
more, way more solid.

49:37.871 --> 49:39.666
It wasn't the same Raph anymore.

49:39.666 --> 49:44.119
And he just had this confidence
that he never had before.

49:44.119 --> 49:47.777
And he just came like,
"Watch out guys, I'm back."

49:50.642 --> 49:52.334
Here comes Raph Derome,

49:52.334 --> 49:56.545
It's a cab 1080.
Two years off the water?
I don't think so.

49:56.545 --> 49:59.306
This dude's on fire!

49:59.306 --> 50:02.102
Welcome to the
Monster Triple Crown.

50:02.102 --> 50:05.416
Raph Derome already winning
the first two stops.

50:11.663 --> 50:13.872
There's the Backside 1080,

50:13.872 --> 50:17.324
and I believe that's the
first time ever in competition.

50:20.914 --> 50:23.882
Raph Derome is on the water.

50:23.882 --> 50:28.680
The intensity, the plow,
the style is beyond next
level with this guy.

50:31.269 --> 50:33.099
It was pretty fun to watch.

50:33.099 --> 50:36.412
Like somebody who looks up to
Raph, even though he's
younger than me,

50:36.412 --> 50:38.138
the stuff that he does,
it's pretty unreal.

50:38.138 --> 50:42.246
So to see him come back that
strong, it was pretty cool.

50:42.246 --> 50:44.558
Even though I wish
he wasn't there at Wake the Line

50:44.558 --> 50:47.320
because then I probably would
have won.

50:47.320 --> 50:49.701
The creme de la creme
of the wakeboarding world

50:49.701 --> 50:53.533
have descended upon Cologne,
Germany, at Wake the Line
at 2012.

50:59.918 --> 51:02.231
There wasn't anything that was
going to get him that year

51:02.231 --> 51:03.853
where he was going to lose.

51:03.853 --> 51:06.235
He was just so precise
in his riding.

51:06.235 --> 51:08.203
I would love to see the count
on how many times

51:08.203 --> 51:11.033
he actually failed in a contest
that year.

51:11.033 --> 51:13.656
The 2010 champion is here.

51:13.656 --> 51:16.452
Raph Derome is on the water.

51:18.178 --> 51:21.216
Is it going to be the double
half cab to finish?

51:21.216 --> 51:25.082
That is a resounding "yes"
from Raph Derome.

51:29.603 --> 51:33.124
And after that, Red Bull
put on
the biggest wakeboard event.

51:33.124 --> 51:35.437
It was a three-tier event.

51:35.437 --> 51:40.062
First tier was Boat,
then was Park and then Big Air.

51:41.408 --> 51:43.893
It was broadcast on NBC.

51:43.893 --> 51:45.688
It was kind of like
mainstream exposure

51:45.688 --> 51:48.760
for a sport that didn't get much
mainstream exposure at the time.

51:51.177 --> 51:55.284
It was cool to watch how
talented some people are at
every aspect of our sport.

51:55.284 --> 51:58.908
The only people I had on my mind
would be Raph and Rathy.

51:58.908 --> 52:05.398
Those two are the only people
that can do
all three things amazing.

52:05.398 --> 52:09.195
It was like the contest that
I personally had waited
for my whole career.

52:09.195 --> 52:12.681
I felt pressure for myself
because, like,
I had thought of myself

52:12.681 --> 52:15.994
as one of the best,
well-rounded wakeboarders
in the world at the time.

52:15.994 --> 52:20.344
And so, like, there was so much
pressure to do good in it.

52:20.344 --> 52:22.622
Boat portion
of the Red Bull Wake Open.

52:22.622 --> 52:23.968
This will be Raphael Derome,

52:23.968 --> 52:25.832
the 20-year-old
from the Great White North.

52:25.832 --> 52:29.974
Raphael, however, this is
kind of a new face right now.

52:29.974 --> 52:32.218
I remember watching him
ride behind the boat

52:32.218 --> 52:34.496
because, honestly,
I didn't know this,

52:34.496 --> 52:36.601
and I'm sure
the whole industry didn't know

52:36.601 --> 52:39.846
how damn good Raph was behind
the boat.

52:39.846 --> 52:42.400
As he's coming in for his
opening move,

52:42.400 --> 52:45.438
and it is a big
Switch stance 900.

52:45.438 --> 52:48.993
Talk about all or nothing,
Raphael got all of it.

52:53.618 --> 52:55.275
I think traditionally you say,

52:55.275 --> 52:59.141
"The guy that could do
everything isn't
the best at anything."

52:59.141 --> 53:02.662
And Raph's arguably the best
at everything.

53:02.662 --> 53:05.872
I mean, he was on the podium
or winning every division.

53:08.219 --> 53:10.187
Bam! Go get some!

53:11.533 --> 53:13.604
Raphael Derome
gets the victory.

53:13.604 --> 53:15.813
And what a weekend for the Canadian.

53:15.813 --> 53:18.160
Raph goes undefeated all year.

53:18.160 --> 53:20.507
I don't know if this has ever
been done in wakeboarding.

53:25.512 --> 53:27.480
Before that event,

53:27.480 --> 53:30.103
you would always say the best
wakeboard in the world is the
best boat rider.

53:30.103 --> 53:35.039
After Wake Open, the best
wakeboarder is the person who
won that event.

53:37.386 --> 53:39.975
My parents were there,
which was really cool.

53:39.975 --> 53:41.735
And I went up to see my dad.

53:41.735 --> 53:44.082
I just remember he was like,
"Man, I don't know how
you did it."

53:44.082 --> 53:46.119
Like, it was so stressful.

53:46.119 --> 53:48.328
Everyone you know,
were lending everything.

53:48.328 --> 53:50.882
That was so much pressure.
He was like, really impressed.

53:50.882 --> 53:52.746
And that was a good moment.

53:52.746 --> 53:57.199
You know, it's like I had
finally proven to my dad
that I could do it,

53:57.199 --> 54:00.133
and I kind of became
what he set up myself for.

54:02.929 --> 54:07.002
Raph was always very good
about being guarded

54:07.002 --> 54:09.384
in a way that it gave
him this aura.

54:11.144 --> 54:15.390
So then, at the end of that
year, when he won all
those contests

54:15.390 --> 54:18.531
and then he dropped RAPH,
an insane web edit,

54:18.531 --> 54:21.396
that was his exclamation point
at the end of that year.

54:27.229 --> 54:31.751
The creativity, what he built
in his little backyard park,

54:31.751 --> 54:37.584
and then the way that he
approached hitting what
he built, it was incredible.

54:47.491 --> 54:52.392
So he literally beat
everyone in every single
aspect of the sport,

54:52.392 --> 54:54.152
as far as riding goes.

54:54.152 --> 54:58.156
And both magazines, which
usually one magazine caters more
to one thing

54:58.156 --> 54:59.572
and the other to something else,

54:59.572 --> 55:01.746
so they both had him as rider
of the year.

55:01.746 --> 55:05.094
So that spoke volumes.

55:05.094 --> 55:07.580
I'm up here for "The Best
Wakeboarder" to give away.

55:07.580 --> 55:09.306
This is the award to win
right here.

55:10.341 --> 55:11.687
And the winner is...

55:12.274 --> 55:14.794
Raph Derome!

55:17.935 --> 55:19.764
Thanks, everyone.

55:19.764 --> 55:21.973
I don't know,
I wasn't ready for
that one, honestly.

55:25.114 --> 55:28.704
Any recognition like that is
more important to me
than a contest.

55:28.704 --> 55:33.088
Like, contests were there
because you kind of
had to prove yourself.

55:34.400 --> 55:36.816
So to get that recognition
is pretty cool.

55:39.577 --> 55:41.510
Alliance Wake
"Rider of the Year."

55:41.510 --> 55:45.687
And it was about how did this
person either perpetuate and
grow the sport,

55:45.687 --> 55:47.861
or how did they take the sport,

55:47.861 --> 55:51.900
and help take it
in a new or better direction.

55:51.900 --> 55:55.179
You know, it was pretty clear
there too,
that everybody was like,

55:55.179 --> 55:57.526
Raph clearly won this.

56:08.226 --> 56:09.504
You know, my brain was going,

56:09.504 --> 56:11.678
"Well, what am I going to
design for this guy?"

56:11.678 --> 56:13.749
You know, everything he's doing
behind the boat,

56:13.749 --> 56:17.512
and he blows me away
with what he's doing on rails,

56:17.512 --> 56:22.896
and I look at him and go, "Dude,
you've just given me an
impossible task."

56:22.896 --> 56:26.452
"I can't even wrap my brain
around how I can make a board to
work for you

56:26.452 --> 56:29.524
in every situation, you know,
because you're...

56:29.524 --> 56:32.837
you need a board that can do
everything, and I can't imagine
what that is."

56:32.837 --> 56:36.047
And he goes, "Well, why does it
have to be just one board?"

56:36.047 --> 56:38.084
And it was like, click.

56:38.084 --> 56:40.569
I mean, he just flipped a switch
in my brain.

56:40.569 --> 56:44.746
I had this perfect test pilot,
that could push both limits

56:44.746 --> 56:47.576
and it's going to benefit
everybody in the sport.

56:57.172 --> 56:59.416
Raph will recognize this.

56:59.416 --> 57:04.282
This was one of the boards
that created his board, the RDX.

57:08.977 --> 57:11.600
I receive a call
and it's from Raph.

57:11.600 --> 57:15.570
Raph is like, "Marc, I need
to see you. I have
something for you."

57:15.570 --> 57:19.366
And he hands me a wakeboard,
and he's like,

57:19.366 --> 57:21.299
"This is my first
Pro Model board."

57:21.299 --> 57:23.888
"I wanted you to be the first
one to have it."

57:24.958 --> 57:26.891
I've always believed in it.

57:26.891 --> 57:31.482
He was this young kid,
like nine years old and
I was telling his dad

57:31.482 --> 57:35.382
that Raph will become
the best wakeboarder ever,
I'm sure.

57:38.731 --> 57:41.906
I could not have
one cooler gift, ever.

57:41.906 --> 57:46.152
That really came,
just really came to get me.

57:50.467 --> 57:55.092
I think he never really
enjoyed being a
professional wakeboarder

57:55.092 --> 57:56.334
like the others did.

57:56.334 --> 58:00.028
Because he was just
so focused all the time.

58:03.169 --> 58:05.585
A lot of people started
kind of bashing on him,

58:05.585 --> 58:09.451
for not being the real deal,
like the Parks Bonifay

58:09.451 --> 58:11.626
that everybody thought he was
going to be.

58:11.626 --> 58:14.387
The guy who was going to be
on top of the podium,

58:14.387 --> 58:16.631
with the two hot girls,
in the bar,

58:16.631 --> 58:19.599
and he was gonna pay
the drinks for everybody

58:19.599 --> 58:24.362
and be the superstar
that not everybody wants to be.

58:24.362 --> 58:26.779
Nobody likes the best guy that
stays home

58:26.779 --> 58:30.990
and doesn't want to go out
and have fun,
because he's too focused.

58:30.990 --> 58:32.854
The amount of times
I tried to get that kid

58:32.854 --> 58:34.856
to come out and party,
and he wouldn't.

58:34.856 --> 58:37.065
But he had a goal
and he stuck with it.

58:37.065 --> 58:39.999
It's impressive. I mean,
I wish sometimes
I would have done that.

58:39.999 --> 58:41.690
Probably would have
done a lot better.

58:41.690 --> 58:44.037
But I was too busy in
the fun time.

58:52.045 --> 58:55.014
I kind of
got caught up in a place
where I didn't want to be.

58:55.014 --> 58:58.327
I wasn't, you know,
the guy made to be
in the limelight

58:58.327 --> 59:01.641
and I was almost feeling
like I was the bad guy,

59:01.641 --> 59:03.367
just having a target on my back.

59:03.367 --> 59:06.715
I didn't get in wakeboarding
to be in that position.

59:07.820 --> 59:09.649
What's there for me to gain?

59:09.649 --> 59:11.686
And now I just got to
fight to keep it.

59:11.686 --> 59:13.998
And there I was,
in the limelight,

59:13.998 --> 59:18.831
getting really good
contracts, getting
exposure, being everywhere.

59:18.831 --> 59:22.524
And the reason why I was doing
all these events was to prove it
to myself,

59:22.524 --> 59:24.250
but prove it to my dad,

59:24.250 --> 59:27.046
and also, I guess I needed
to prove it to the industry,

59:27.046 --> 59:28.841
and that was just
part of the process.

59:28.841 --> 59:31.360
But it was something
I had thought of for a while:

59:31.360 --> 59:35.019
moving away from events
and contests and focus

59:35.019 --> 59:39.576
and go back to what I wanted
to do in the first place
since day one.

59:47.204 --> 59:49.655
The wakeboarding scene
is definitely a scene.

59:49.655 --> 59:52.934
And certainly Orlando
is the epicenter of that scene.

59:52.934 --> 59:56.731
A lot of pros move to Orlando to
be part of the scene
and get recognized

59:56.731 --> 59:59.734
and kind of be around the media
and come up through it.

59:59.734 --> 1:00:05.084
In my opinion, what that does
is, it homogenized what
wakeboarding looks like.

1:00:06.430 --> 1:00:08.190
I think the beautiful thing
about Raph

1:00:08.190 --> 1:00:10.607
is that he was completely
on his own program.

1:00:13.195 --> 1:00:16.751
I felt, like, if I could go back
home and build my own rails

1:00:16.751 --> 1:00:20.271
and I could really showcase
my riding, in its best light.

1:00:20.271 --> 1:00:23.240
And I really thought that was
the best thing for wakeboarding

1:00:23.240 --> 1:00:25.069
and It was what
I wanted to do anyway.

1:00:45.089 --> 1:00:49.853
Your video part is like
the direct representation of
your riding.

1:00:49.853 --> 1:00:53.166
The direct expression of you.
It's extension of you.

1:00:53.166 --> 1:00:55.652
You have to be creative,
you have to work with others.

1:00:55.652 --> 1:00:58.585
You have to have
this project and this goal,

1:00:58.585 --> 1:01:00.208
build it, and then show it
to everybody.

1:01:00.208 --> 1:01:02.072
So, I mean, the most important
thing in the world.

1:01:08.975 --> 1:01:11.219
I had signed major deals
for a couple of years,

1:01:11.219 --> 1:01:14.947
so of course it came with money
and responsibilities

1:01:14.947 --> 1:01:18.329
and you got to be accessible.
You got to do a lot more.

1:01:18.329 --> 1:01:20.228
A lot more demos and clinics,

1:01:20.228 --> 1:01:23.680
and I knew it was going to
take away time for me to
work on that project.

1:01:25.578 --> 1:01:28.995
I kind of became a bit obsessive
of keeping everything secret.

1:01:28.995 --> 1:01:33.724
No one is going to see,
like, one single trick
that I'm working on.

1:01:33.724 --> 1:01:36.969
So that when it comes out,
it's going to make a big impact.

1:01:36.969 --> 1:01:41.594
But I did it so intensively
that for two years I kind
of disappeared.

1:01:45.253 --> 1:01:49.222
Raph being very
secretive, he never
wanted me to share anything.

1:01:49.222 --> 1:01:50.948
Basically, everyone
was asking me,

1:01:50.948 --> 1:01:52.363
"Hey, so what's up
with your brother?"

1:01:52.363 --> 1:01:53.468
"What's he doing?"

1:01:53.468 --> 1:01:54.711
And that turned into, "So..."

1:01:54.711 --> 1:01:56.195
"Where's Raph?"

1:01:56.195 --> 1:02:00.061
Like months, especially, like,
even before social media,

1:02:00.061 --> 1:02:02.063
it was at least like,
"Oh, he's probably doing this."

1:02:02.063 --> 1:02:03.961
But then once social media
became a thing,

1:02:03.961 --> 1:02:05.825
and we still didn't know
where Raph was,

1:02:07.068 --> 1:02:08.621
gosh, what a mystery.

1:02:10.105 --> 1:02:11.728
Fortunately or unfortunately,

1:02:11.728 --> 1:02:14.385
I had a firsthand view as
to what the wake
industry was thinking

1:02:14.385 --> 1:02:18.044
when Raph just kind of went
and disappeared for a while.

1:02:18.044 --> 1:02:20.667
We are asking the question
the same as the viewers

1:02:20.667 --> 1:02:23.567
and the enthusiasts and
subscribers. We're like, "Hey,
what's up with Raph?"

1:02:29.159 --> 1:02:32.818
I really didn't understand
the scope of what he was doing.

1:02:32.818 --> 1:02:37.892
All I knew, I'm working on
this thing and I need a
bunch of boards.

1:02:37.892 --> 1:02:39.859
I didn't even know what he was
going to use them for.

1:02:39.859 --> 1:02:43.173
I just knew that I needed
to create a range of boards

1:02:43.173 --> 1:02:44.622
for him to be free.

1:02:46.555 --> 1:02:49.800
The pressure started building
and quick.

1:02:51.560 --> 1:02:54.011
His manager for Liquid Force,
Aaron Grace,

1:02:54.011 --> 1:02:56.773
calling me and being like,
"I can't reach Raph."

1:02:56.773 --> 1:02:58.740
"Where is he? What is he doing?"

1:03:00.397 --> 1:03:04.263
Hey, dude, are you
riding? Like, we're
paying you right now.

1:03:04.263 --> 1:03:07.887
It would get frustrating
to the point where, you know,

1:03:07.887 --> 1:03:09.820
I have to have a talk with him.

1:03:09.820 --> 1:03:12.064
"Hey, Raph, you've got to get on
the grid sometimes,

1:03:12.064 --> 1:03:14.791
you got to, you know, check your
emails, answer a text message."

1:03:17.103 --> 1:03:18.656
The more I thought like,

1:03:18.656 --> 1:03:21.867
"Well, Raph, you're stretching
the elastic a little too far,

1:03:21.867 --> 1:03:24.179
and soon the elastic's--
you're gonna have to let it go,

1:03:24.179 --> 1:03:25.629
or it's going to pop
in your face."

1:03:28.839 --> 1:03:30.910
The outside pressures
from sponsors is real.

1:03:30.910 --> 1:03:33.706
People are like, "Hey, we
want you to go
do these signings."

1:03:33.706 --> 1:03:36.640
Or whatever it may be, clinics.
You know, there's
a lot of obligations

1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:38.987
that come along with being a
a professional wakeboarder.

1:03:38.987 --> 1:03:42.508
When they're paying you, they
want you to be out and as
markable as they can to you.

1:04:14.126 --> 1:04:17.681
I watched it at least three
times in a row

1:04:17.681 --> 1:04:22.859
to go back and try and figure
out how Raph put together some
of the lines that he did.

1:04:24.481 --> 1:04:27.656
Not only how the hell
did he land what he did,

1:04:27.656 --> 1:04:29.693
but how the hell did he even
think of it.

1:04:32.247 --> 1:04:36.010
I think everyone's starting to
embrace that that's who
Raph was.

1:04:36.010 --> 1:04:40.497
Like, he's this reclusive,
strange guy who's going to go
live in Canada,

1:04:40.497 --> 1:04:43.224
then come back in a couple of
months and blow our minds
with a video.

1:04:45.847 --> 1:04:47.504
My normal train of thought is,

1:04:47.504 --> 1:04:49.402
"Why are you not
riding every day?"

1:04:49.402 --> 1:04:53.096
"And why, you know, why are you
not in our sport every day?"

1:04:53.096 --> 1:04:54.994
And he is the dark horse, right?

1:04:54.994 --> 1:04:58.066
You don't see him for a while,
and he comes out
and it's explosive.

1:05:06.523 --> 1:05:11.597
This is quality, style, artistic
nature of what
wakeboarding can be.

1:05:11.597 --> 1:05:14.393
It's like,
this can look this rad.

1:05:31.237 --> 1:05:35.793
Not only did he bring a new
style of wakeboarding,
but a new style of edits.

1:05:35.793 --> 1:05:39.211
It's not just like a shot, like
everything wide and everything,
but there's detail.

1:05:39.211 --> 1:05:41.144
There's, like,
so much art involved.

1:05:42.973 --> 1:05:44.595
By working so closely

1:05:44.595 --> 1:05:47.909
with one of his best friends,
Jonathan Ferguson,

1:05:47.909 --> 1:05:53.432
John was a very good filmmaker,
so together they were working
hand in hand

1:05:53.432 --> 1:05:57.505
and bringing all the ideas
that Raph had, to the industry.

1:05:59.990 --> 1:06:02.613
One of the best things
about "Beyond Perception"

1:06:02.613 --> 1:06:05.478
is it was the first video
in wakeboarding

1:06:05.478 --> 1:06:08.930
where I could take that video
and show it to really
jaded people

1:06:08.930 --> 1:06:11.001
in snowboarding go,
"Yeah, I've seen everything,

1:06:11.001 --> 1:06:12.727
it's you know, you're not gonna
impress me."

1:06:12.727 --> 1:06:14.142
And I go, "Watch this!"

1:06:26.189 --> 1:06:31.159
It opened people's eyes to the
legitimacy and relevancy of wakeboarding.

1:06:34.024 --> 1:06:36.958
A lot of it was
this influence from other sports
outside of wakeboarding,

1:06:36.958 --> 1:06:39.133
whether it's
skateboarding, snowboarding.

1:06:41.411 --> 1:06:43.930
So I think it was completely
healthy and amazing.

1:06:43.930 --> 1:06:46.416
What Raph did was
bringing that into the sport.

1:06:46.416 --> 1:06:48.418
Because, you know, we're all--

1:06:48.418 --> 1:06:51.007
Board sports are all a big
family and why don't we
take influence from them.

1:06:51.007 --> 1:06:52.594
We should be taking influence
from them.

1:06:54.941 --> 1:06:57.979
It's such a given that
you're going to
do certain contests

1:06:57.979 --> 1:07:00.223
and you're going to do
certain levels of travel.

1:07:00.223 --> 1:07:05.055
And so for him to shun that
definitely cost him
opportunities and money,

1:07:05.055 --> 1:07:06.919
and that takes courage.

1:07:09.094 --> 1:07:11.648
I felt like there was no limits.
I could do whatever I wanted,

1:07:11.648 --> 1:07:15.548
and no one's gonna, you know,
no one's gonna drop me.

1:07:15.548 --> 1:07:17.550
I am signed for a few years.

1:07:17.550 --> 1:07:20.346
I want to ride home,
and I want to create this.

1:07:20.346 --> 1:07:24.040
I felt like I was totally free.

1:07:24.040 --> 1:07:29.217
It was a tough blow
when Red Bull decided
not to re-sign my contract

1:07:29.217 --> 1:07:31.668
just because
I never saw it coming.

1:07:31.668 --> 1:07:35.534
I felt like I had dominated
in all the events

1:07:35.534 --> 1:07:37.329
on the contest side of things.

1:07:37.329 --> 1:07:39.572
And even if I had disappeared
for two years,

1:07:39.572 --> 1:07:42.713
my video part I worked on,
came out really well,

1:07:42.713 --> 1:07:45.061
and the answer from the public
was really good.

1:07:47.546 --> 1:07:50.204
I remember it was a discussion
about the helmet, the hat,

1:07:50.204 --> 1:07:51.860
there were so many things.

1:07:51.860 --> 1:07:55.381
I'm like, "Raph, sometimes
you have to take a little bit

1:07:55.381 --> 1:07:59.213
of your artistical ego out of
the equation and just go with
the flow a little bit."

1:08:01.663 --> 1:08:04.080
I guess that's been
one of the downfalls of Raph.

1:08:04.080 --> 1:08:07.462
He's not keeping up
with modern-day marketing,

1:08:07.462 --> 1:08:11.708
like social media, you know.
He never really--
It wasn't his thing.

1:08:11.708 --> 1:08:15.988
He thought it was really lame,
and he just didn't want
to be that.

1:08:18.163 --> 1:08:20.717
I stretched it too far, like,
it just came out that, you know,

1:08:20.717 --> 1:08:22.098
"We're paying you."

1:08:22.098 --> 1:08:24.548
"You're not branding yourself
like we wanted to."

1:08:24.548 --> 1:08:27.724
But on the other hand,
it was way more important

1:08:27.724 --> 1:08:30.761
to make all these ideas
come to life,
over the money.

1:08:40.323 --> 1:08:42.394
After that, what else
was out there?

1:08:43.291 --> 1:08:44.844
The next step was winching.

1:08:48.986 --> 1:08:50.988
That was the way that I see
the sport should go.

1:08:50.988 --> 1:08:55.579
It was a lot more street-style
riding and being from Quebec,

1:08:55.579 --> 1:08:58.064
there's a big culture
of street snowboarding,

1:08:58.064 --> 1:09:00.274
which was what I was brought
up doing.

1:09:00.274 --> 1:09:04.623
I was very lucky to be in a
time where there was a
lot of room for progression.

1:09:08.178 --> 1:09:11.733
Winching is basically
using the natural habitat

1:09:11.733 --> 1:09:16.945
or, like manmade, like dams
and spillways and handrails.

1:09:16.945 --> 1:09:18.913
I remember him, like,
living on Google maps.

1:09:18.913 --> 1:09:21.364
Like just pointing spots
and doing, like, street view

1:09:21.364 --> 1:09:23.642
and he had like a
thousand of them.

1:09:26.679 --> 1:09:30.131
I don't think anyone understands
how dangerous winching is.

1:09:30.131 --> 1:09:32.168
The consequences are
so fucking high.

1:09:34.515 --> 1:09:37.242
Take a snowboard hit
that's, like, considered sketchy

1:09:37.242 --> 1:09:39.313
and now speed it up four times.

1:09:42.626 --> 1:09:46.354
How hard it is for one
to get a crew together

1:09:46.354 --> 1:09:48.529
and then to get all that gear
in there.

1:09:50.462 --> 1:09:52.533
A cop might pull up
and just cancel the shoot.

1:09:52.533 --> 1:09:53.741
That's another aspect.

1:09:57.503 --> 1:10:00.057
I mean, it's always gnarly.
It's like six inches of water.

1:10:04.130 --> 1:10:05.373
There's a winch,

1:10:05.373 --> 1:10:07.237
it's not like getting pulled
by a boater cable.

1:10:07.237 --> 1:10:08.859
It's constantly accelerated.

1:10:14.210 --> 1:10:16.971
I mean, for it to be a clip,
there's got to be risk.

1:10:16.971 --> 1:10:18.490
I don't want to watch anything
where there's not like

1:10:18.490 --> 1:10:20.250
a little bit of a risk,
where it's not hard.

1:10:28.224 --> 1:10:30.847
Sometimes you question yourself
if it's really worth it.

1:10:30.847 --> 1:10:32.952
Why would I risk it all for
winching?

1:10:32.952 --> 1:10:35.334
It's super dangerous.
No one really pushes for it.

1:10:35.334 --> 1:10:38.579
No one's demanding you to do it.

1:10:38.579 --> 1:10:42.479
There is a Winston Churchill
quote that says the performance
is not a success

1:10:42.479 --> 1:10:44.930
unless you put your head
in the lion's mouth. Right?

1:10:44.930 --> 1:10:48.174
And that's like kind of what you
gotta do. You gotta like push it
to the edge.

1:10:52.075 --> 1:10:54.353
The way I see it, like,
it makes you feel special,

1:10:54.353 --> 1:10:57.045
that you have a chance to do
something that no one
else has ever done,

1:10:57.045 --> 1:10:59.013
and rarely in life
do you have that chance.

1:11:12.854 --> 1:11:17.238
I don't think you really know
if the risk is going to be worth
the reward

1:11:19.102 --> 1:11:21.242
unless you really know
what you're risking,

1:11:21.242 --> 1:11:25.729
because you never really know
how bad it can get until
you get there.

1:11:28.284 --> 1:11:31.528
No one's accepting the
consequence of what
happened to Ben.

1:11:31.528 --> 1:11:34.359
Like, you know, I grew up
riding with Ben every day

1:11:34.359 --> 1:11:36.809
and seeing something like that,

1:11:36.809 --> 1:11:39.571
it makes you see that it doesn't
just happen in movies,

1:11:39.571 --> 1:11:41.573
but like your very best friend,
that's beside you.

1:11:41.573 --> 1:11:44.645
It can happen to you also.

1:11:44.645 --> 1:11:49.097
If you really want to weigh
in the pros and cons out
of everything,

1:11:49.097 --> 1:11:50.823
Is it really worth it?

1:11:50.823 --> 1:11:53.930
What else is worth it?
Like, you can work in a library

1:11:53.930 --> 1:11:55.690
all your life and
get hit by lightning.

1:11:57.865 --> 1:12:00.626
As heavy as it sounds, it's like
I don't think he'd want us

1:12:00.626 --> 1:12:04.423
to stop wakeboarding,
because if everyone
stops doing it,

1:12:04.423 --> 1:12:08.462
then it kind of takes away from
the reason why he was doing it.

1:12:08.462 --> 1:12:10.153
So, of course,
he would say,

1:12:10.153 --> 1:12:12.707
like, make sure you
calculate your risk really well,

1:12:12.707 --> 1:12:14.502
and he'd want us to be careful

1:12:14.502 --> 1:12:17.125
and make sure we understand
what we are doing.

1:12:18.713 --> 1:12:21.371
Being in a hospital for a year
and everybody asking me,

1:12:21.371 --> 1:12:25.099
"hey, if you could wakeboard
again tomorrow, would you do
it?"

1:12:25.099 --> 1:12:26.307
Yeah, I'd do it again.

1:12:26.307 --> 1:12:30.484
I don't even imagine
another second saying no.

1:12:41.080 --> 1:12:44.049
When you actually do it,
and conquer that trick

1:12:44.049 --> 1:12:46.085
it's like the best feeling
in the world, you know.

1:12:46.085 --> 1:12:48.640
Like it's basically like
why you keep doing it.

1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:52.437
You're addicted to, like,
the next big win really.

1:12:58.235 --> 1:13:00.686
Once you get that feeling,
it just never goes away.

1:13:04.932 --> 1:13:07.003
A lot of people don't have
passions in life,

1:13:07.003 --> 1:13:09.039
and I think those are the people
that are the most scared

1:13:09.039 --> 1:13:11.076
and who are going to have
a different outlook on people

1:13:11.076 --> 1:13:12.526
that are pushing themselves.

1:13:12.526 --> 1:13:14.735
So you might as well not think
about the negative side

1:13:14.735 --> 1:13:17.116
and you just never know
how it's gonna finish.

1:13:17.116 --> 1:13:20.292
And if you've had the most fun
you've had the whole time,
you won.

1:14:05.682 --> 1:14:08.754
After traveling the world for
winch spots,

1:14:08.754 --> 1:14:13.483
Raph is reinvited to one
of the biggest cable contests,

1:14:13.483 --> 1:14:15.796
and it's Munich Mash.

1:14:15.796 --> 1:14:17.729
Munich Mash,
it's probably one of the most

1:14:17.729 --> 1:14:21.526
well respected competitions
in cable wakeboarding.

1:14:21.526 --> 1:14:24.770
All these new kids,
they all want to beat Raph

1:14:24.770 --> 1:14:26.738
because they have never
been able to beat Raph.

1:14:26.738 --> 1:14:30.017
Because Raph had not been
competing on cable for the last
couple years.

1:14:30.017 --> 1:14:34.262
And there's new kids on the
block like Guenther Oka.

1:14:34.262 --> 1:14:38.646
Certainly on paper,
one of the favorites now,
Guenther Oka.

1:14:38.646 --> 1:14:41.753
To have a stage
like Munich Mash...

1:14:41.753 --> 1:14:43.927
...and to be able to compete
against Raph

1:14:43.927 --> 1:14:46.309
was a really surreal experience

1:14:46.309 --> 1:14:48.345
because I've watched his videos,

1:14:48.345 --> 1:14:52.142
but I don't think I ever saw
what he was like fully capable
of in a contest

1:14:52.142 --> 1:14:54.593
because it's like a whole
different frame of mind.

1:14:56.181 --> 1:14:58.632
I didn't have to go there
to prove anything.

1:14:58.632 --> 1:15:01.669
But I really wanted to go there
to prove something to myself

1:15:01.669 --> 1:15:05.846
because I didn't know how
well I would do against
these younger guys.

1:15:08.055 --> 1:15:12.369
He was definitely the most
notorious rider at that event.

1:15:12.369 --> 1:15:15.372
But I didn't feel like
super threatened by Raph.

1:15:15.372 --> 1:15:18.134
I'm just like, you know,
Raph's a little bit older now,

1:15:18.134 --> 1:15:19.653
like can he still hang on?

1:15:32.562 --> 1:15:34.875
Back then there was
like three or four guys

1:15:34.875 --> 1:15:37.015
that I had to watch out for
I felt like.

1:15:37.015 --> 1:15:41.053
But now it was like
every single rider that's
here can win.

1:15:41.053 --> 1:15:44.125
Raph Derome he won
best trick on Friday evening.

1:15:44.125 --> 1:15:47.370
And Munich Mash could be
his triumphant return.

1:15:51.892 --> 1:15:54.411
Watching him, like,
navigate through the course

1:15:54.411 --> 1:15:57.276
and make power plays
when he had to.

1:15:57.276 --> 1:15:59.762
Like lacing up tricks
when it really counted.

1:16:03.869 --> 1:16:06.182
Beautiful 270 up.

1:16:06.182 --> 1:16:07.493
That was so impressive.

1:16:07.493 --> 1:16:09.254
And like in the final,
one of the rail to rail

1:16:09.254 --> 1:16:12.429
that he had never done before,
he did it perfectly.

1:16:12.429 --> 1:16:14.293
That was so,
so clean.

1:16:19.022 --> 1:16:21.059
Guenther Oka.

1:16:21.059 --> 1:16:23.440
An absolutely unbelievable way
to wakeboard on the boat.

1:16:23.440 --> 1:16:25.546
And the cable right there is
showing that.

1:16:27.479 --> 1:16:29.895
Rail to rail back so 180.

1:16:29.895 --> 1:16:31.241
But that was so nice.

1:16:33.692 --> 1:16:36.281
And there it is the 270 transfer.

1:16:36.281 --> 1:16:37.696
Guenther Oka.

1:16:40.596 --> 1:16:42.943
Raph Derome and Guenther Oka
wait for the scores.

1:16:42.943 --> 1:16:47.568
83.42. It will go
to the Canadian, Raph Derome,

1:16:47.568 --> 1:16:51.089
in his first return
to a big international contest.

1:16:52.884 --> 1:16:57.785
If I was gonna lose to anybody,
100% be Raph.

1:16:57.785 --> 1:17:00.961
Look at the stoke right there.
Raph, over the moon.

1:17:00.961 --> 1:17:02.894
He's gonna go back
to his brother, Oli Derome,

1:17:02.894 --> 1:17:04.309
another professional wakeboarder.

1:17:04.309 --> 1:17:06.311
They're gonna be ecstatic
about this one.

1:17:09.694 --> 1:17:11.143
He looked so happy.

1:17:11.143 --> 1:17:15.803
I saw little brother Raph
from when he was 12 years old.

1:17:15.803 --> 1:17:19.635
When I saw his face
on the screen with a W.

1:17:26.469 --> 1:17:28.436
I was away from the scene
for a little while.

1:17:28.436 --> 1:17:32.302
It was the off-season and
I remember I was snowboarding
going down the hill,

1:17:32.302 --> 1:17:36.341
and I see my brother
sending me this article.

1:17:36.341 --> 1:17:39.206
The 10 most influential
wakeboarders of
the last decade.

1:17:40.552 --> 1:17:42.485
I see six, five and four.

1:17:42.485 --> 1:17:43.969
And I'm like, "Holy shit."

1:17:43.969 --> 1:17:46.972
Like if they sent me this
article, I must be
in the top 10.

1:17:48.664 --> 1:17:50.769
So I'm like, "My God,
like what's going on?"

1:17:50.769 --> 1:17:52.944
Like I'm so stressed out
you got to watch it.

1:17:52.944 --> 1:17:55.015
I was sort of like
pushing the moment away.

1:17:55.015 --> 1:17:58.501
Keep snowboarding down
and I looked at number three
and I closed my phone again

1:17:58.501 --> 1:18:00.952
and I was like,
"My God, this is too much."

1:18:05.577 --> 1:18:07.959
You know, for Raph to end up
number one

1:18:07.959 --> 1:18:11.031
on most influential riders
in the last decade...

1:18:11.031 --> 1:18:13.240
...it's the most
meaningful recognition

1:18:13.240 --> 1:18:17.520
because your influence isn't,
you know, "That was the coolest
guy to party with."

1:18:17.520 --> 1:18:21.351
Your influence is, you know,
your riding influenced people

1:18:21.351 --> 1:18:23.319
to emulate your style.

1:18:27.737 --> 1:18:31.189
It's interesting
if you look back at historical,

1:18:31.189 --> 1:18:33.432
iconic athletes in the sport.

1:18:33.432 --> 1:18:35.434
You know there's different
generations. There's Parks.

1:18:38.403 --> 1:18:40.750
And Byerly at the early days.

1:18:42.441 --> 1:18:44.512
In the history of wakeboarding,

1:18:44.512 --> 1:18:49.241
I wouldn't say that there is
another rider that sort of
transcends all disciplines

1:18:49.241 --> 1:18:52.762
and styles
and is sort of a unique,

1:18:52.762 --> 1:18:55.385
borderline mysterious
personality like Raph.

1:18:58.975 --> 1:19:01.426
Raph made wakeboarding so cool

1:19:01.426 --> 1:19:04.360
and did so many things
that like just no one's ever
seen before.

1:19:05.257 --> 1:19:07.363
It's like Parks and Raph.

1:19:07.363 --> 1:19:09.710
Like those two guys are the only
ones that like changed the game.

1:19:11.643 --> 1:19:13.679
That message to Raph,
I would say

1:19:13.679 --> 1:19:15.751
I know
as a professional wakeboarder

1:19:15.751 --> 1:19:17.683
and giving your life
and fucking everything to it

1:19:17.683 --> 1:19:19.789
how much it means and I admire
you because you did it

1:19:19.789 --> 1:19:23.034
the way that you wanted to do
it, and you did it on
your own terms

1:19:23.034 --> 1:19:24.552
and not a lot of wakeboarders

1:19:24.552 --> 1:19:26.865
probably even myself can get
to say that.

1:19:29.350 --> 1:19:33.941
I mean, shit, he's the best.
He's the GOAT in my eyes.

1:19:35.978 --> 1:19:39.429
He literally never sold out and
he's never untrue to himself.

1:19:39.429 --> 1:19:42.778
And I think that should be
respected by everyone,
no matter what.

1:19:55.066 --> 1:19:57.654
He was on his own art project.

1:19:57.654 --> 1:20:00.761
That piece of art, you know,
is represented by his career.

1:20:00.761 --> 1:20:03.626
And if he feels like that
piece of art is complete,

1:20:03.626 --> 1:20:06.767
then more power to him
if he chooses to move on.

1:20:08.458 --> 1:20:11.668
It is crazy how much you change
as a person through your career

1:20:11.668 --> 1:20:16.259
like you get retrospective on
life at a very early age.

1:20:17.605 --> 1:20:21.851
We've gone to
fully live in money,

1:20:21.851 --> 1:20:25.924
fame, peak, start to fade.

1:20:25.924 --> 1:20:29.341
And so you can look back and,
like, start to appreciate
everything already.

1:20:29.341 --> 1:20:31.965
So I hope this is
kind of like for Raph like that.

1:20:35.313 --> 1:20:38.040
I have always wanted to retire,
like, on my own terms

1:20:38.040 --> 1:20:39.800
when I felt
it was the right time.

1:20:39.800 --> 1:20:42.458
And what I overcame
with wakeboarding

1:20:42.458 --> 1:20:45.771
and the journey it took me
on, like, it's always
gonna stay with me.

1:21:07.000 --> 1:21:09.899
I left everything I had
of wake in me to this project,

1:21:09.899 --> 1:21:13.489
and it made it real that,
hey, this is the last time
you were

1:21:13.489 --> 1:21:16.181
riding as a professional
in the water.

1:21:16.181 --> 1:21:19.322
I wish this can inspire
other people to go after
their dream,

1:21:19.322 --> 1:21:23.395
and I just want to say thank
you to everyone that's
been around me

1:21:23.395 --> 1:21:25.121
and like more than ever,

1:21:25.121 --> 1:21:28.400
it truly feels right
to say goodbye and to move on.

1:21:28.953 --> 1:21:30.264

1:27:28.553 --> 1:27:33.593
When a tree reaches a certain
height, it stops growing.

1:27:33.593 --> 1:27:37.735
The roots it put down
early in life,
keep it grounded.

1:27:37.735 --> 1:27:43.396
The trees
that grew up close by,
keep it strong.

1:27:43.396 --> 1:27:47.572
The conditions that had
nourished it and nurtured
it on the way up

1:27:47.572 --> 1:27:51.024
are still there to support it.

1:27:51.024 --> 1:27:55.615
Because when you reach the
top, you should stop and
enjoy the view

1:27:57.272 --> 1:28:00.309
before branching out
and trying something new.

1:28:52.810 --> 1:28:57.021
I could never really repay
my parents for the upbringing

1:28:57.021 --> 1:28:59.264
and the opportunities that
they gave us.

1:28:59.264 --> 1:29:02.233
For them to support our passions
the way they did.

1:29:04.304 --> 1:29:07.756
There's no way I'll ever be able
to give that back to my parents.

1:29:07.756 --> 1:29:09.827
It's, you know, it has no value.

1:29:09.827 --> 1:29:12.312
It's undescribable.

1:29:16.212 --> 1:29:19.837
Is there something you'd want to
tell your brother that you never
told him?

1:29:22.322 --> 1:29:24.186
I am proud of you, bro.

1:29:24.186 --> 1:29:25.463
You're my hero.
