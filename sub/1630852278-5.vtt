The band is great.

01:54.739 --> 01:57.283
- Wait, I know this song, right?
Who sings this originally?

01:57.283 --> 01:59.202

He wrote it.

Yeah, he's a good songwriter.

02:03.581 --> 02:05.041
Well, he better be.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.836
When he dropped out of the
ninth grade, he was like,

02:07.836 --> 02:10.421
"Mom, that's it, I'm done,
I'm a musician,"

02:10.421 --> 02:13.341
and then I was like,

02:13.341 --> 02:17.262
"Okay, hotshot, let's do it, but
I'm gonna hold you to the fire."

02:17.262 --> 02:18.763

musician, then be a musician,
right?

02:25.687 --> 02:27.981

didn't get to where they are

02:27.981 --> 02:30.900

about the Counting Crows

02:33.403 --> 02:35.572

that question.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.930

05:09.100 --> 05:11.853
- Okay, um...

05:11.853 --> 05:15.481

a couple years ago

05:15.481 --> 05:19.402
