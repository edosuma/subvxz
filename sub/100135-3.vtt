WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:02.127
<i>You gotta get that deal closed.</i>

00:02.211 --> 00:04.671
And the most important thing
is cohost approval.

00:06.882 --> 00:10.260
Start putting together a list of names,
men who can sit next to Alex for now

00:10.344 --> 00:12.513
and also work with someone younger
once she's gone.

00:12.596 --> 00:13.597
Rapist!

00:13.680 --> 00:15.557
Sexual misconduct
is what I'm being accused of.

00:15.641 --> 00:17.267
Don't you wave your fucking hand at me!

00:17.351 --> 00:18.393
-Your show sucks.
-Please.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.145
You really think this is gonna
help you get a job?

00:20.229 --> 00:23.482
People like you are the reason
broadcast news is what it is.

00:23.565 --> 00:27.861
Do not show your face tonight.
Do not do that to Alex.

00:27.945 --> 00:29.071
My tux is pressed.

00:29.947 --> 00:31.156
I can't unpress my tux.

00:31.240 --> 00:34.076
Cory would like for you to be at the
Leadership in Journalism event tonight.

00:34.159 --> 00:36.411
I'm confused.
I had a meeting with Chip Charlie Black,

00:36.495 --> 00:38.288
and it did not go well.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.748
You remember Bradley Jackson?

00:39.831 --> 00:41.041
Oh, my God.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.794
But why is she sitting at that table
over there with our people?

00:43.877 --> 00:46.672
He sat you at my table to fuck with me.

00:46.755 --> 00:47.840
Me fuck with you?

00:47.923 --> 00:49.591
I'm not closing without cohost approval.

00:49.675 --> 00:51.677
Well, I'm sorry to hear that,
because you're not getting it.

00:51.760 --> 00:52.845
Then I'll walk.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.221
Then walk.

00:54.304 --> 00:57.891
I have some exciting news
to share with all of you tonight.

00:57.975 --> 01:01.979
I would like to announce
my new <i>Morning Show</i> cohost...
ï»¿1

02:52.538 --> 02:58.461
I would like to take this moment to
announce my new Morning Show cohost,

02:59.337 --> 03:01.089
Bradley Jackson.

04:10.199 --> 04:11.701
Don't look too surprised.

04:11.784 --> 04:13.453
-All right, stand up. Up.
-Okay.

04:13.536 --> 04:15.496
-Bradley!
-Bradley!

04:15.580 --> 04:18.082
-Miss Jackson!
-Bradley, how are you feeling?

04:18.166 --> 04:19.792
-Smile. Smile.
-How do you feel right now, Miss Jackson?

04:20.126 --> 04:21.127
Is she drunk?

04:21.544 --> 04:22.754
That would make sense.

04:22.837 --> 04:25.840
Get her to the studio.
Don't let either of them make statements.

04:25.924 --> 04:30.428
She is the perfect person for the job,
and you will see what I'm talking about.

04:31.054 --> 04:32.055
Yeah.

04:32.513 --> 04:34.724
Hope you had fun up there.

04:34.807 --> 04:37.018
Oh, I'm really excited too.

04:37.101 --> 04:39.604
-Are you both gonna be lead anchors?
-Bradley.

04:41.814 --> 04:43.191
Let's go. Let's go.

04:43.274 --> 04:44.525
Bradley, Bradley,

04:44.609 --> 04:46.319
-Maggie Brener, New York Magazine.
-Hi.

04:46.402 --> 04:49.822
-Congratulations on--
-Maggie, my love. Tonight is a tease.

04:49.906 --> 04:53.451
But, Cory, how'd you manage
to keep such a delightful secret?

04:54.410 --> 04:57.956
Well, you guys are only interested
in the obvious choices.

04:58.039 --> 05:00.625
Bradley Jackson isn't obvious.

05:01.042 --> 05:03.795
After Mitch, we felt we needed
a big change and quickly.

05:03.878 --> 05:08.216
One that makes a statement
about where we intend to go.

05:08.716 --> 05:09.759
Where is that?

05:18.184 --> 05:20.353
If you guys wanna know more...

05:21.771 --> 05:25.566
tune in on Monday
for Alex and Bradley's first show.

05:26.025 --> 05:28.152
Bradley.
Bradley, how excited are you?

05:28.236 --> 05:30.196
How long are you gonna be
with this network?

05:30.530 --> 05:32.031
What are you fucking doing?

05:32.824 --> 05:35.118
Congratulations, Bradley Jackson.

05:35.618 --> 05:37.412
Your life just took off.

05:37.495 --> 05:39.789
Don't say anything to anyone
and meet me at the studio.

05:39.872 --> 05:41.416
You're changing the game.
How does it feel?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.419
-Bradley! Bradley.
-Are you excited to work with Miss Levy?

05:44.502 --> 05:47.130
What is the statement that you would like
to make to young women?

05:47.213 --> 05:49.299
-I don't--
-Hey, let's get you outta here.

05:49.382 --> 05:50.967
They're looking at you
like you're raw meat.

05:51.050 --> 05:52.510
-Okay.
-Okay. We're going this way.

05:52.594 --> 05:53.970
-Bradley!
-Excuse me.

05:54.053 --> 05:55.179
This way.

05:56.472 --> 05:59.684
Oh, my God. What the hell just happened?

05:59.767 --> 06:02.186
They'll have answers for us at the studio.
Chip knows we're on our way.

06:02.270 --> 06:04.439
Oh, no, no. I'm going to LaGuardia.
LaGuardia, please.

06:04.522 --> 06:07.066
-We're not going to LaGuardia--
-Yes.

06:07.150 --> 06:10.570
And with all due respect, who the hell
are you to tell me what to do?

06:10.653 --> 06:11.905
Do you have a cigarette?

06:13.656 --> 06:14.657
Twenty bucks.

06:15.408 --> 06:17.994
Bravo, buddy.
Way to take advantage of a woman in need.

06:18.077 --> 06:19.454
Do you have $20?

06:20.955 --> 06:25.043
Yeah. Cory put it on public record
that the show is launching on Monday.

06:25.126 --> 06:26.586
Yeah, well, he's insane too.

06:26.669 --> 06:29.505
Agreed. But let's for one moment
assume you are the coanchor.

06:29.589 --> 06:31.716
You can assume that.
I don't want to assume that.

06:31.799 --> 06:34.385
I'm going to LaGuardia.
I don't wanna be the coanchor.

06:34.802 --> 06:36.012
Why the hell not?

06:36.095 --> 06:39.098
Because they're gonna use me
to try and get an Eagle News audience

06:39.182 --> 06:42.060
that I won't attract
because I'm not that kinda conservative.

06:42.143 --> 06:43.311
But you don't know that,

06:43.394 --> 06:46.397
because there's no way in hell
that I have been vetted.

06:46.481 --> 06:50.276
And I am being set up here
to be some sort of fall guy,

06:50.360 --> 06:51.653
and I am not interested in that.

06:51.736 --> 06:52.737
Not interested.

06:53.321 --> 06:54.322
Do you have a light?

06:54.405 --> 06:55.531
No smoking, ma'am.

06:56.658 --> 06:58.034
You've gotta be kidding me.

06:58.826 --> 07:00.703
What the hell were you thinking?

07:01.204 --> 07:04.832
Why would you back that unhinged woman
to a room full of reporters?

07:04.916 --> 07:06.334
You were given clear instructions.

07:06.417 --> 07:10.129
Why would you box us in
to a Monday launch with that nobody?

07:10.213 --> 07:13.549
I feel it's a bit dismissive to refer to
them as "unhinged woman" and "nobody."

07:13.633 --> 07:16.636
Don't fuck with me. I need to understand
how you plan to fix this.

07:16.719 --> 07:20.556
Or explain to me
why I shouldn't fire you along with Levy?

07:20.640 --> 07:25.687
Well, because that "unhinged woman"
did us a serious favor.

07:26.354 --> 07:30.191
Look, this show slipped in the ratings,
Fred, because the show is stale.

07:30.275 --> 07:33.444
Alex Levy, her sell-by date,
it expired years ago.

07:33.528 --> 07:35.405
She needed to go.
Everybody knew we were gonna fire her,

07:35.488 --> 07:37.949
but Mitch fucked that up
by fucking everything.

07:38.032 --> 07:39.867
So, now, everybody's curious.
What are we gonna do?

07:39.951 --> 07:42.745
So what we're gonna do is,
we're gonna give her this victory.

07:42.829 --> 07:45.331
A Pyrrhic victory.
Make her think that she's won.

07:45.415 --> 07:49.002
But really, we're gonna let
this "nobody" in to freshen the show.

07:49.085 --> 07:52.672
Juice the ratings for sweeps and finally
push Alex Levy off the shelf for good

07:52.755 --> 07:54.882
when it is convenient for us

07:54.966 --> 07:58.428
and when we don't have to look
like the bad guys.

07:58.511 --> 08:01.180
That doesn't explain
why we have to rush them out for Monday.

08:01.264 --> 08:02.265
Well, the streak.

08:02.348 --> 08:05.184
If we don't do something next week,
the streak is over.

08:05.268 --> 08:09.397
YDA is not sneaking up on us,
they're breathing down our fucking necks,

08:09.480 --> 08:12.942
in spite of our "Mitch is a predator"
boost. It feels old.

08:13.026 --> 08:16.571
People are getting too used to their
favorite cuddly men turning into monsters,

08:16.654 --> 08:22.160
but watching a beloved woman's breakdown

08:22.243 --> 08:26.581
is timeless American entertainment.

08:30.001 --> 08:32.629
The Morning Show audience
values stability.

08:33.421 --> 08:37.342
When has it been the case that a morning
audience prefers fighting over family?

08:37.967 --> 08:39.802
I don't know. Families fight, Fred.

08:39.886 --> 08:43.848
Look, all right, hey, give me a month
of "The Alex and Bradley Show,"

08:43.932 --> 08:47.644
either they work well together,
or it's horrible.

08:47.727 --> 08:51.731
Regardless, putting Bradley in
lets us get back to replacing Alex.

08:51.814 --> 08:55.860
And it'll be interesting
and fun, fresh, you know,

08:55.944 --> 08:57.695
which is imperative right now.

08:59.906 --> 09:01.491
I'm gonna make something clear.

09:02.408 --> 09:06.496
I have an easy fall guy
when all this goes to shit.

09:08.539 --> 09:10.041
Oh, we're talking about me, right?

09:10.458 --> 09:12.752
Chaos, it's the new cocaine, Fred.

09:14.295 --> 09:15.546
You screwed yourself.

09:15.630 --> 09:19.175
Committed a fireable offense,
overtly in breach of contract.

09:19.259 --> 09:23.054
We'll be lucky if the network
even continues negotiations.

09:24.055 --> 09:27.475
You need to go in and find Fred
and apologize tonight.

09:28.518 --> 09:32.522
Right, right.
Is there an alternative option?

09:32.605 --> 09:34.607
Not unless you wanna pull the rehab card.

09:34.691 --> 09:36.859
We could say you were emotional
about Mitch.

09:36.943 --> 09:38.987
But I'm not emotional about Mitch.

09:39.070 --> 09:40.947
I was emotional because
no one's fucking listening to me!

09:41.030 --> 09:43.741
Mom! What's going on? Are you? Are you--

09:43.824 --> 09:46.243
-Yes, I'm fine. Sorry.
-Let's just take a beat here, please.

09:46.327 --> 09:50.081
-Sarah, listen. I'm going to handle this.
-It's okay. It's okay.

09:50.164 --> 09:52.750
Then put on your apology face
and fucking mean it.

09:52.834 --> 09:55.712
-Absolutely. I completely understand.
-Do you understand?

09:57.005 --> 09:58.089
Guys, guys.

09:58.172 --> 10:01.551
Listen, don't--
Honey, baby. Honey, listen to me.

10:01.968 --> 10:06.055
Sometimes women can't ask for control.

10:06.139 --> 10:08.766
So, they have to take it, okay?

10:10.476 --> 10:11.477
Okay.

10:11.561 --> 10:14.522
I want you to remember that. Okay, baby?

10:14.606 --> 10:15.982
-Okay.
-Okay.

10:27.452 --> 10:31.289
Okay. Everybody knows you're here.
They want you to sit tight for 15 minutes.

10:31.372 --> 10:32.498
I will not sit tight.

10:32.582 --> 10:33.791
There are some snacks. Some TV.

10:33.875 --> 10:35.752
There's definitely some booze
around here somewhere.

10:35.835 --> 10:37.253
They're deciding my life out there.

10:37.337 --> 10:39.797
Yes, and I know that's insane,
but Alex is meeting with the CEO.

10:39.881 --> 10:42.800
Chip is gathering the staff, and if you're
even remotely considering doing this--

10:42.884 --> 10:44.010
I don't know what this is.

10:44.093 --> 10:45.553
You need to let them come to you.

10:45.637 --> 10:48.264
You need to let yourself take a breath.
Have a fucking drink.

10:48.681 --> 10:50.058
Think about what you want.

10:52.977 --> 10:54.854
Consider this the start
of me being a great producer.

10:54.938 --> 10:56.564
-You're not my producer.
-Yet.

11:03.446 --> 11:04.447
Oh, my God.

11:08.660 --> 11:09.953
Hal, where have you been?

11:10.036 --> 11:12.872
You cannot seriously
be making this about me right now.

11:12.956 --> 11:15.959
Okay? Can we please talk about you?
You're all over the news.

11:16.584 --> 11:17.585
This is so weird.

11:17.669 --> 11:20.505
Yeah, no kidding. Is Mom okay?

11:24.550 --> 11:25.802
She's pissed at me.

11:25.885 --> 11:30.014
She said you embarrassed her with
her friends because you didn't tell her.

11:30.098 --> 11:31.099
I didn't know.

11:32.558 --> 11:33.935
Is this even real?

11:36.104 --> 11:38.648
Fuck, Hal. I hope not.

11:46.531 --> 11:49.325
-Hey. She's waiting in the green room.
-You're a god.

11:49.409 --> 11:51.661
-Is this for real? Or are--
-Fucking hope not.

11:51.744 --> 11:54.455
What the hell was she thinking?
It's a room full of press, and she just--

11:54.539 --> 11:56.499
I think she was thinking
it would be effective.

11:56.583 --> 11:57.584
-Yeah, well...
-So?

11:57.667 --> 12:02.755
Wait till she finds out Bradley Jackson
is a fucking raving lunatic. Jesus.

12:03.298 --> 12:04.799
-Chip.
-What?

12:05.174 --> 12:06.384
I wanna produce her.

12:07.635 --> 12:08.636
Why?

12:08.720 --> 12:10.680
Because I've been in purgatory.
I'm too good for that.

12:10.763 --> 12:13.016
If this is real,
you should put your best person on it,

12:13.099 --> 12:17.312
and you know that's fucking me,
and, honestly, I like her,

12:17.729 --> 12:19.939
which could go a long way
to making this work.

12:21.733 --> 12:23.693
If this works,
it's gonna be a fucking disaster,

12:23.776 --> 12:24.861
and you're gonna be tied to it.

12:24.944 --> 12:27.572
Yeah, I've been tied to disasters before.

12:28.489 --> 12:29.949
I want this, Chip.

12:34.913 --> 12:38.958
Hold on. Let's just get some quiet.
Can I get quiet for two seconds, please?

12:39.042 --> 12:43.630
I refuse to accept any of this as reality.
Fuck. Jesus.

12:47.675 --> 12:48.718
Who died?

12:49.886 --> 12:51.220
Ideally, not my show.

12:52.597 --> 12:54.182
Come on, Chip. Cheer the fuck up.

12:54.265 --> 12:56.851
We're in the middle of an epic rebirth.

12:57.685 --> 12:58.895
So, this is happening?

12:59.938 --> 13:03.024
Look, I do know that this comes
as a bit of a surprise.

13:03.107 --> 13:05.360
Alex jumped the gun a little bit
on the announcement,

13:05.443 --> 13:08.738
but we've been quietly vetting Bradley
for a while now,

13:08.821 --> 13:11.282
looking for someone with
that kind of unpredictable energy.

13:11.366 --> 13:14.744
And I know Monday feels fast.
That's why we hired a veteran.

13:14.827 --> 13:17.664
Not an anchor veteran.
Zero anchor experience, in fact.

13:18.414 --> 13:22.085
But she has got raw talent
coming out of her pores.

13:22.543 --> 13:23.795
And you know it.

13:24.963 --> 13:26.589
So, let's get moving, people.

13:26.673 --> 13:30.635
We've got 48 hours to define
the character of Bradley Jackson.

13:30.718 --> 13:32.971
I want wardrobe tests, screen tests,
makeup tests.

13:33.054 --> 13:34.722
I wanna have those tests focus-grouped.

13:34.806 --> 13:36.224
We need a contract. Where's legal?

13:36.307 --> 13:38.309
I'm telling you,
it's not a given she'll go on air Monday.

13:39.185 --> 13:40.270
Are you legal?

13:41.104 --> 13:44.274
I'm Mia Jordan, Bradley's producer.

13:46.234 --> 13:47.777
Well, that happened fast.

13:49.612 --> 13:52.699
Yeah, I felt I was a few steps behind,

13:52.782 --> 13:56.035
so I wanted one of my best people
to manage the circus.

14:00.039 --> 14:03.001
Well, just make sure
that she can read a teleprompter.

14:04.377 --> 14:08.047
I don't want to rain on the parade,
but I snaked a Mitch accuser from YDA.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.093
-You got a Mitch accuser?
-Yeah.

14:12.176 --> 14:14.429
Not great optics to launch a new anchor

14:14.512 --> 14:17.140
next to a sexual assault victim's
brave return.

14:17.223 --> 14:19.642
Are you kidding me? That's perfect.

14:19.726 --> 14:20.727
What is your name?

14:20.810 --> 14:22.604
-Hannah. I'm head booker.
-Hannah.

14:22.687 --> 14:28.192
Hannah nailed it,
'cause we're creating a safe space here.

14:28.276 --> 14:30.069
It's a feminine space.

14:30.153 --> 14:32.864
This is an era for The Morning Show

14:32.947 --> 14:36.826
where women make the rules
and give voice to the silenced.

14:37.535 --> 14:40.413
Speaking of which,
nobody says a fucking word to the press.

14:40.496 --> 14:41.998
They're gonna be circling us
like vultures.

14:42.081 --> 14:45.168
So, anyone who leaks will be murdered...

14:46.544 --> 14:47.837
career-wise.

14:48.171 --> 14:52.008
Okay. I'm gonna run upstairs
to the public spanking of Alex Levy.

14:59.057 --> 15:00.475
Neal, I have an idea.

15:00.558 --> 15:02.352
I know it's only been a few days,

15:02.435 --> 15:04.229
and I know that you're gonna tell me
it's too soon,

15:04.312 --> 15:08.983
but let's just for a second,
look at the larger context of #MeToo.

15:09.692 --> 15:11.945
It's been, what? Two years?

15:12.028 --> 15:13.363
We're two years in.

15:13.947 --> 15:17.617
I feel that people are screaming
for an honest conversation.

15:18.534 --> 15:19.911
And what do I do?

15:20.912 --> 15:21.955
What do I do best?

15:22.789 --> 15:24.374
I am a journalist.

15:24.457 --> 15:28.294
I can feel when the world needs me
to articulate something for them.

15:28.378 --> 15:30.797
To help them understand.

15:31.965 --> 15:36.344
And believe me, I know this is gonna
require a high degree of sensitivity.

15:37.470 --> 15:40.807
But I fucking love a tightrope. I love it.
It makes me feel alive.

15:41.641 --> 15:44.519
You know what?
Maybe all of this happened for a reason.

15:44.602 --> 15:49.816
Because I think that if I can get
in there, and I can show my face,

15:49.899 --> 15:54.529
and I can look and address
the darkness that exists within--

15:54.612 --> 15:56.197
You're gonna answer--

15:56.281 --> 15:57.407
Fuck.

16:02.203 --> 16:03.663
Who is Bradley Jackson?

16:09.210 --> 16:11.921
Mitch, I love you.

16:12.338 --> 16:13.881
I mean, you know that's true.

16:13.965 --> 16:15.592
You're a fantastic talent.

16:16.551 --> 16:22.140
But the fact of the matter is that
a working relationship is based on work,

16:23.600 --> 16:25.727
and that's not gonna
be happening for a while.

16:27.478 --> 16:29.105
Are you dropping me, Neal?

16:34.277 --> 16:37.864
We have a lot of female clients
that are journalists that we represent.

16:37.947 --> 16:38.948
You understand?

16:39.032 --> 16:41.409
There are certain pressures
brought to bear on us.

16:41.492 --> 16:44.078
Believe me, I wish it was different
than the way it is,

16:44.162 --> 16:45.580
but this is the reality now.

16:46.164 --> 16:47.916
Maybe you should sign Bradley Jackson,

16:47.999 --> 16:49.792
whoever the fuck that is.

16:51.169 --> 16:52.754
Would you like me to leave?

16:53.713 --> 16:54.714
Yes.

17:09.729 --> 17:11.064
I don't feel I need to remind you

17:11.147 --> 17:14.442
that this network has been
very good to you over the years.

17:15.193 --> 17:18.071
We have always shown you
personal and professional respect.

17:18.780 --> 17:21.783
I never anticipated we would be met
with such utter disrespect

17:21.866 --> 17:24.160
and insubordination in return.

17:26.829 --> 17:30.959
This network has every right
to terminate you immediately.

17:32.168 --> 17:34.712
You have placed us
in an impossible situation.

17:34.796 --> 17:36.839
You have embarrassed yourself.

17:36.923 --> 17:40.802
You have done something
unforgivably selfish.

17:41.261 --> 17:43.930
And for what? To what end?

17:44.973 --> 17:48.017
I find myself wondering if we can
even trust you with the privilege

17:48.101 --> 17:50.603
of being on air for The Morning Show.

17:54.148 --> 17:55.149
Are you done?

17:57.068 --> 17:58.069
I'm sorry?

18:00.655 --> 18:05.910
The part you guys never seem to realize
is that you don't have the power anymore.

18:07.245 --> 18:10.373
The news division is held up by my show.

18:11.165 --> 18:15.211
And the only thing keeping us afloat
is me.

18:16.462 --> 18:18.005
Because guess what?

18:18.923 --> 18:21.341
America loves me.

18:23.094 --> 18:25.680
And therefore, I own America.

18:27.139 --> 18:30.560
It seems pretty fucking simple,
but so easy for you guys to forget.

18:32.520 --> 18:34.397
Are you actually trying
to justify your action--

18:34.480 --> 18:35.982
You're not listening!

18:36.398 --> 18:38.693
I don't need to justify anything.

18:39.694 --> 18:44.240
You all are so convinced that you are
the rightful owner of all of the power

18:44.324 --> 18:45.783
that it doesn't even occur to you

18:45.867 --> 18:48.494
that someone else
could be in the driver's seat.

18:49.913 --> 18:54.876
And so, we have to just gingerly step
around your male egos

18:54.959 --> 18:58.463
in order to not burst
this precious little bubble.

18:59.714 --> 19:00.924
Well, surprise!

19:01.841 --> 19:03.217
I'm bursting it.

19:08.181 --> 19:10.558
We are doing this my way.

19:12.143 --> 19:15.521
Because, frankly, I've let you bozos
handle this long enough.

19:21.486 --> 19:23.488
Not the apology you were expecting?

19:42.548 --> 19:43.758
Wanna take a seat?

19:46.344 --> 19:48.388
Is that an invitation or a command?

19:48.721 --> 19:50.515
You sound a little pissed off.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.934
I don't like surprises.

19:53.017 --> 19:54.978
Come on. That was a pretty good surprise.

19:55.061 --> 19:57.230
No. You don't get to make this about me.

19:57.313 --> 20:01.442
You dropped a bomb, and I don't know why.
Maybe you're trying to blow up your life.

20:01.526 --> 20:03.403
Maybe you were angry, which I get,

20:04.404 --> 20:06.406
but you don't have the right
to fuck with me.

20:06.823 --> 20:08.032
Fuck with you? How?

20:08.825 --> 20:12.203
By offering you
the most coveted anchor job in the world?

20:12.287 --> 20:13.288
I don't want your job.

20:13.371 --> 20:15.832
Oh, honey, bullshit.

20:16.332 --> 20:19.460
You are so cocky.
You just think I'm gonna do this?

20:20.795 --> 20:22.255
I know you're going to do this.

20:22.964 --> 20:24.215
I don't have a contract.

20:24.299 --> 20:28.636
Well, great. I just put you
in a great spot to negotiate.

20:29.053 --> 20:30.722
This job is yours.

20:31.306 --> 20:33.808
I'm welcoming you with open arms.

20:33.891 --> 20:37.937
I'm giving you the biggest news platform
you could ever have.

20:38.271 --> 20:41.316
If you're a true journalist,
you don't say no to this.

20:41.399 --> 20:44.152
I'm not sure
this is considered true journalism.

20:46.446 --> 20:50.450
And how many current or former presidents
have you interviewed?

20:53.286 --> 20:56.456
This job requires
a certain kind of positivity.

20:56.539 --> 20:57.832
I'm not a perky person.

20:57.916 --> 21:00.251
I don't care.
I don't want us to be the same.

21:00.668 --> 21:03.338
I'm not looking to groom my replacement.

21:04.088 --> 21:05.131
I want a partner.

21:06.341 --> 21:07.550
Do you?

21:07.634 --> 21:09.886
Or do you want somebody
who's beholden to you?

21:09.969 --> 21:13.139
Somebody who's grateful
that you plucked them from obscurity?

21:13.222 --> 21:17.352
Because if that's what you're hoping for,
I will give you serious buyer's remorse.

21:19.270 --> 21:21.189
You are convinced that you know me.

21:22.649 --> 21:25.318
I can guarantee that you are
underestimating me.

21:25.777 --> 21:28.655
And I am really fucking over
people doing that.

21:30.531 --> 21:32.533
I want you here at 7:00 a.m. tomorrow.

21:33.034 --> 21:36.537
I suggest that you get up at 5:00.
4:00 on Sunday.

21:37.372 --> 21:39.332
Start getting yourself conditioned.

21:40.917 --> 21:42.126
Alex...

21:45.380 --> 21:46.798
I don't like being used.

21:46.881 --> 21:48.258
Oh, my God.

21:48.675 --> 21:52.512
Could you just try, like, taking advantage
of the situation presented?

21:53.471 --> 21:55.682
That sounds like something
you might enjoy.

21:56.975 --> 21:59.519
Come on. See you tomorrow.

22:16.160 --> 22:18.037
We're gonna hit up
a lot of the nitty-gritty today,

22:18.121 --> 22:21.541
because being a morning show anchor
is the hardest job on television bar none.

22:21.624 --> 22:24.460
So, we're gonna meet with makeup,
wardrobe, we'll do some screen tests.

22:24.544 --> 22:26.963
We'll meet with marketing,
publicity, research.

22:27.046 --> 22:29.090
We're gonna drill transitions.

22:29.173 --> 22:32.260
Look, the other thing is that,
and don't shoot the messenger,

22:32.760 --> 22:34.345
the show will be heavily scripted.

22:34.429 --> 22:35.513
What do you mean by "heavily"?

22:35.597 --> 22:38.641
Completely.
It's gonna be completely scripted.

22:38.725 --> 22:42.812
No, I'm not a novice. I don't like
things to be overtly scripted.

22:42.896 --> 22:46.441
It sort of eliminates any possibility
of something truthful happening.

22:46.524 --> 22:49.110
Plus, I have a habit
of going off-script sometimes.

22:49.193 --> 22:50.403
Two-Fucks Jackson.

22:50.820 --> 22:53.072
Well, I see the research
has finally begun.

22:53.156 --> 22:55.033
I can relate to a good self-sabotage,

22:55.116 --> 22:58.536
but it cannot happen on The Morning Show.

22:58.620 --> 23:03.583
Okay, Mia, listen. I get that you're
excited and y'all want this to work out.

23:03.666 --> 23:06.544
I just don't know how I feel about being
forced onto national television

23:06.628 --> 23:08.546
just to make an ass of myself.

23:08.630 --> 23:12.175
I wanna be clear, by showing up today,
I'm not agreeing to this,

23:12.258 --> 23:15.136
and I'm not signing a contract, okay?

23:16.095 --> 23:18.014
Baby steps, okay?

23:20.266 --> 23:21.851
You know who's the most excited?

23:21.935 --> 23:23.144
-Who?
-Alex.

23:23.519 --> 23:24.520
Seriously.

23:24.604 --> 23:26.564
She's gonna be shepherding you
through this entire weekend,

23:26.648 --> 23:28.816
along with me, of course.

23:29.275 --> 23:31.778
Okay? She really wants
to take a firm hand in this.

23:31.861 --> 23:34.072
-She really cares.
-She does?

23:34.155 --> 23:36.407
Absolutely.
This whole weekend is about you.

23:36.491 --> 23:39.661
Getting to know Bradley Jackson,
who you are, what's important to you.

23:40.328 --> 23:42.455
Really? You think I can define myself?

23:43.539 --> 23:44.540
Absolutely.

23:45.250 --> 23:47.752
This is gonna be fun. Watch.

23:47.835 --> 23:48.878
Can't wait.

23:51.631 --> 23:54.008
You guys, thank you. Thank you, but no.

23:54.092 --> 23:56.552
Fucking no. I'm sorry.
I know you're tired,

23:56.636 --> 23:59.722
and I know you hate me right now,
but I really don't give a shit.

23:59.806 --> 24:04.727
All we have to do is figure out
who Bradley Jackson is next to Alex Levy.

24:04.811 --> 24:07.021
Who do you partner with a 24-karat bitch?

24:08.231 --> 24:10.233
That's actually really funny. Don't...

24:10.650 --> 24:11.943
Good morning.

24:12.527 --> 24:15.196
Oh, good to see you're all
in such good spirits today.

24:15.280 --> 24:17.115
Milk Bar for the writers.

24:17.198 --> 24:21.452
Yes, I'm shamelessly bribing you
with sugar for working overtime.

24:21.536 --> 24:22.829
So, you're joining us?

24:23.246 --> 24:24.247
Absolutely.

24:24.664 --> 24:27.625
We were just discussing the enigma
that is Bradley Jackson.

24:27.709 --> 24:28.918
Fabulous.

24:29.002 --> 24:30.587
So, if you'd give us a few minutes--

24:30.670 --> 24:32.505
No, I'd actually like to get in on that.

24:32.922 --> 24:35.133
-It's actually why I'm here.
-To discuss Bradley?

24:35.967 --> 24:37.510
Among other things.

24:38.678 --> 24:42.015
Look, guys, this is a pressure-cooker
moment, all right?

24:42.098 --> 24:43.933
This is a massive transition.

24:44.017 --> 24:45.894
We are redefining ourselves,

24:45.977 --> 24:49.981
and I need to make sure
that we are all on the same page.

24:50.064 --> 24:51.441
So I'm gonna be here all weekend.

24:52.358 --> 24:54.110
-All weekend?
-Yeah, all weekend.

24:54.193 --> 24:55.695
Sean typed up a schedule. Sean.

24:55.778 --> 24:57.614
So, I spoke to wardrobe,

24:57.697 --> 25:02.452
and they're going to screen test some
looks that will appeal to her demographic.

25:02.535 --> 25:05.413
And then I want us to bang out some copy

25:05.496 --> 25:08.791
so that we can talk about what segments
that we will be giving to Bradley.

25:08.875 --> 25:10.710
What time does Ashley Brown get here?

25:10.793 --> 25:12.211
-Around 10:00.
-10:00. Okay, great.

25:12.295 --> 25:14.088
I'll do her pre-interview then.

25:14.172 --> 25:16.966
Sorry, should I know who Ashley Brown is?

25:17.050 --> 25:18.176
Mitch's victim.

25:18.259 --> 25:19.761
No, let's not call her a victim.

25:19.844 --> 25:21.638
Okay, what should we call her then?

25:21.721 --> 25:24.474
I think "accuser" feels more appropriate.

25:24.933 --> 25:28.394
Look, if she wants to call herself
a victim, we can take our lead from her.

25:28.478 --> 25:31.522
But I think it's important
that she feels in control of it.

25:31.606 --> 25:33.399
In control of the language used.

25:33.483 --> 25:37.820
So, just to be clear,
and I appreciate the typed-up schedule,

25:38.988 --> 25:41.032
you're doing the Ashley Brown interview?

25:43.576 --> 25:44.911
Yes, I am, Chip.

25:49.374 --> 25:50.458
What?

25:51.751 --> 25:54.462
Okay. All right, team.

25:55.088 --> 25:57.507
I will address the elephant in the room.

26:00.760 --> 26:04.722
Yes, yes. I worked side by side with Mitch
for 15 years.

26:05.265 --> 26:07.100
God knows he was not perfect.

26:07.558 --> 26:09.143
I felt it daily.

26:10.520 --> 26:12.230
But I didn't know he was that guy.

26:13.773 --> 26:15.108
And that's a problem.

26:16.526 --> 26:18.111
I fell asleep at the wheel.

26:19.487 --> 26:22.490
But I want you to know that I am here now.

26:23.157 --> 26:24.617
And I'm here for Ashley,

26:25.535 --> 26:26.911
and I'm here for you.

26:27.328 --> 26:30.039
I'm available, I'm accessible,
and I'm awake.

26:33.626 --> 26:35.712
So, shall we?

26:39.799 --> 26:44.846
Stay on two. As we said, go with Yanko.
Go with Yanko.

26:44.929 --> 26:47.307
If you live in New England, not so fast.

26:47.390 --> 26:49.976
You'll be seeing one last snowfall
of the season.

26:50.059 --> 26:53.605
We do have some exciting wind blowing
our way down here in New York City too,

26:53.688 --> 26:56.816
and she goes by the name
of Bradley Jackson.

26:56.900 --> 26:58.401
-See what I did there?
-Very smooth.

26:58.484 --> 26:59.903
Welcome to command center.

26:59.986 --> 27:05.116
I may be stating the obvious, but it's
a pretty exciting weekend here at TMS.

27:05.199 --> 27:07.619
We have our new Morning Show cohost,
Bradley, in the halls,

27:07.702 --> 27:11.497
and she and Alex are prepping a really,
really amazing show for this Monday.

27:11.581 --> 27:12.707
That's right, Daniel.

27:12.790 --> 27:16.544
And that includes an interview with our
very own former colleague Ashley Brown,

27:16.628 --> 27:20.590
who has bravely agreed to return and talk
about her experience with Mitch Kessler.

27:21.299 --> 27:22.467
That's going to be something.

27:22.550 --> 27:24.677
-Yeah. It's very, very brave.
-Yeah. Big stuff.

27:24.761 --> 27:27.055
We hope you spend
your Monday morning with our new family.

27:27.138 --> 27:28.139
I'm Daniel Henderson.

27:28.222 --> 27:29.223
I'm Alison Namazi.

27:29.307 --> 27:30.350
I'm Yanko Flores.

27:30.433 --> 27:32.685
And this was the weekend edition
of The Morning Show.

27:32.769 --> 27:34.604
-Ready, four?
-Until next time.

27:34.687 --> 27:37.690
Take four. Insert. Roll credits.

27:40.276 --> 27:43.363
'Cause America loves a good Cinderella
story, just as long as she's a white girl.

27:43.446 --> 27:46.866
Please. Disney got you a black princess,
like, what, 2008?

27:46.950 --> 27:47.951
He's not wrong.

27:48.034 --> 27:50.453
-I don't recall that.
-You didn't see it. There was a frog.

27:50.870 --> 27:53.373
Bradley. Hi. Claire. We met the other day.

27:53.456 --> 27:55.458
-Yeah, yeah. I remember.
-I'm with the digital team today.

27:55.541 --> 27:58.503
If it's cool, I'm gonna shadow you
while we do your screen tests.

27:58.586 --> 28:01.381
Give people a front-row look
on how we make a star.

28:03.258 --> 28:06.135
Sorry, they told me to say that.
Stupid. Let's go.

28:06.219 --> 28:07.220
Okay.

28:07.303 --> 28:08.763
Fuck me.

28:11.015 --> 28:14.894
Tell me why
I shouldn't hand in my resignation now.

28:16.187 --> 28:17.814
Daniel, I could write you a fucking book.

28:17.897 --> 28:20.525
Yesterday,
you said it was my chair to lose.

28:20.608 --> 28:22.777
And I don't recall fucking up the pass.

28:22.860 --> 28:26.739
So why am I out there previewing
a conservative beauty queen?

28:26.823 --> 28:29.826
You know, she's not a beauty queen,
and she's actually more of a libertarian,

28:29.909 --> 28:30.910
so I don't know.

28:30.994 --> 28:33.329
-Chip, I'm out.
-Daniel, come on. Hold on.

28:33.413 --> 28:35.206
Take a breath, take a breath,
take a breath.

28:35.290 --> 28:37.959
I have been told to take deep breaths
my whole life.

28:38.042 --> 28:39.627
I can't do it anymore.

28:39.711 --> 28:40.795
Daniel, I'm telling you,

28:40.878 --> 28:43.881
you walk out that door, you're never
gonna get back in when the chair opens up.

28:43.965 --> 28:45.008
And when will that be?

28:45.091 --> 28:46.551
Because women live longer than men,

28:46.634 --> 28:49.220
and those two
look like they do a lot of Pilates.

28:49.304 --> 28:51.973
Read the tea leaves!
Bradley Jackson is a nobody.

28:52.056 --> 28:55.310
Alex is... clearly struggling, you know?

28:55.393 --> 28:59.439
It was a desperate move from someone
who had their fucking ego bruised, okay?

28:59.522 --> 29:01.649
This will fail.

29:01.733 --> 29:06.154
And, when it does,
maybe two chairs are gonna open up.

29:07.030 --> 29:10.700
Okay? So, please, I'm begging you,

29:12.952 --> 29:14.954
ride with me through this shitstorm,

29:15.371 --> 29:18.082
and I promise you
the show will be yours in the end.

29:32.221 --> 29:33.431
Here we go.

29:37.185 --> 29:38.311
Yeah!

29:42.023 --> 29:43.024
Here's the thing.

29:43.107 --> 29:46.361
Everything can be recontextualized.

29:46.444 --> 29:48.863
They take my movies that I directed,

29:48.947 --> 29:51.866
and they pervert them
to fit a convenient narrative.

29:52.533 --> 29:54.452
Hugging and Loving, right?

29:54.535 --> 29:55.620
That's a veiled portrait

29:55.703 --> 29:58.081
of my grandmother's assimilation story,
for God's sake.

29:58.164 --> 30:00.583
That is a terrific film.
That's my mom's favorite film.

30:00.667 --> 30:05.588
So, now, it's about what I apparently did
to all my leading ladies.

30:06.172 --> 30:07.966
Well, when did hugging become a sin?

30:08.049 --> 30:09.842
Fuck it. I love to hug.

30:09.926 --> 30:11.386
Huggings are nice.

30:11.469 --> 30:14.555
Yeah. Jeez. That is crazy.

30:14.639 --> 30:19.727
No, no, no. Crazy is how they loved
the title Jessica Over Easy

30:19.811 --> 30:22.730
and then, of course, now they just
rip me to shreds over it.

30:22.814 --> 30:26.025
God damn it. You know what?
They just twist everything.

30:26.109 --> 30:29.237
I don't even understand
what their message is they're sending out.

30:29.696 --> 30:32.865
That women are not allowed to be
in possession of their sexual choices?

30:32.949 --> 30:34.951
When they fixate on us,
they lose sight of the issues.

30:35.034 --> 30:36.578
I actually feel bad for the kids.

30:36.661 --> 30:38.663
'Cause there's nothing sexy about consent.

30:40.373 --> 30:41.457
Well...

30:41.541 --> 30:45.712
That came out wrong, and that was creepy.

30:46.254 --> 30:47.880
I guess what I'm saying is...

30:48.339 --> 30:51.092
humanity happens in the unspoken moments,

30:51.175 --> 30:55.013
and I just feel badly for a generation
that loses that.

30:56.097 --> 30:57.765
Wow. That's really well said.

31:00.184 --> 31:01.477
Fuck it.

31:01.561 --> 31:02.562
Fuck it.

31:03.146 --> 31:04.439
We're not in prison.

31:05.315 --> 31:06.774
Prison of public opinion.

31:07.984 --> 31:09.694
That's exactly what I wanna talk about.

31:10.612 --> 31:13.323
The discussion, this whole Me Too thing,

31:14.073 --> 31:17.160
it is so fucking puritanical and myopic.

31:17.243 --> 31:18.369
No one is addressing it.

31:18.453 --> 31:22.081
A woman can say one thing about you.

31:22.165 --> 31:24.167
It doesn't matter what her motivation is.

31:24.250 --> 31:27.086
And everything you've done in your life...
gone.

31:27.170 --> 31:29.505
Your career erased.

31:29.923 --> 31:31.257
You deserve better, buddy.

31:32.258 --> 31:33.468
You deserve better.

31:35.553 --> 31:36.763
I have an idea.

31:38.222 --> 31:41.517
We do a documentary.
You direct it. I do the interviews.

31:41.601 --> 31:44.437
We make them look at it.
We make them look at us.

31:44.520 --> 31:46.981
We ask to be a part of the conversation.

31:47.440 --> 31:48.650
I mean...

31:49.734 --> 31:51.527
we did something wrong, okay.

31:51.945 --> 31:52.946
What?

31:53.029 --> 31:54.656
If that's the way you feel, fine,

31:54.739 --> 31:56.950
but explain it to me,
'cause I don't fucking get it.

31:57.033 --> 31:58.868
A conversation with the victims.

31:58.952 --> 32:01.704
Yes. And I think we can do it
in a really smart way.

32:01.788 --> 32:03.957
I don't think we refer to them as victims.

32:04.040 --> 32:05.166
I think...

32:05.917 --> 32:08.670
that's a concess-- I don't think
it's something we want to concede.

32:08.753 --> 32:10.797
No, no, we do call them victims,

32:10.880 --> 32:12.924
and then we prove why they're not.

32:13.007 --> 32:16.803
I'm not sure that we should use gotcha
journalism with the women who accused us.

32:16.886 --> 32:19.472
Oh, fuck that! Jesus. They did it with us.

32:19.555 --> 32:20.598
"Gotcha!

32:21.391 --> 32:23.726
I'll fuck you for the role,
and then I'll win an Oscar."

32:23.810 --> 32:26.437
And then, "Oh, now I'm 50 and irrelevant,

32:26.521 --> 32:29.566
so I'll scream 'rape'
and then I'll force a settlement."

32:29.649 --> 32:32.485
You know,
as if that lazy lay deserves a cent.

32:32.569 --> 32:34.237
No, no, you're wrong.

32:36.114 --> 32:37.323
Wow. Is that real?

32:37.407 --> 32:38.575
"Gotcha!

32:38.658 --> 32:40.868
I said I was 20. I was only 15."

32:41.452 --> 32:44.497
Bullshit. "Then why do you look
like a tired old bag?"

32:44.581 --> 32:48.251
And yeah, I'd love--
I'd kill to see her birth certificate.

32:52.547 --> 32:54.090
How come I never heard about that one?

32:54.173 --> 32:56.342
'Cause she's going the legal route.

32:56.426 --> 32:58.052
Big fucking chance.

32:58.636 --> 33:00.305
Statute of limitations, babe.

33:00.388 --> 33:04.225
You know, sometimes you gotta say,
"God bless America."

33:04.309 --> 33:05.643
Finally protected.

33:07.395 --> 33:08.688
Yeah, well,

33:10.273 --> 33:12.442
maybe we should just interview the men,

33:13.276 --> 33:18.031
because it might be naive to think
that the women would want to participate.

33:18.114 --> 33:19.699
Do you think we could get Cosby?

33:20.283 --> 33:23.161
No, let's-- No.

33:23.244 --> 33:28.291
No. I think another smart idea would be

33:28.374 --> 33:32.962
to talk about the specificity
of the Me Too movements.

33:33.046 --> 33:38.968
There was the first wave of guys
who were accused,

33:39.052 --> 33:41.095
and then there was a second wave,

33:41.179 --> 33:44.015
and we could talk about the nuance
between the two.

33:45.266 --> 33:46.351
I don't think I follow.

33:46.434 --> 33:51.689
Well, the first wave was... really bad.

33:52.148 --> 33:55.735
And then the guys accused
in the second wave was just different,

33:55.818 --> 33:59.739
and I don't think
we should be scared to talk about it.

34:04.827 --> 34:07.622
Spell it out for me, won't you, Mitch?

34:15.880 --> 34:18.299
Well, you are actually a predator.

34:19.717 --> 34:21.761
And people are gonna want you to own that.

34:32.981 --> 34:34.774
As opposed to...

34:37.026 --> 34:38.945
What are you exactly, Mitch?

34:43.825 --> 34:45.034
Not you.

34:47.579 --> 34:49.956
The organization has now raised
over $80,000

34:50.039 --> 34:52.417
to help end sexual assault
on college campuses.

34:52.500 --> 34:53.876
Pace it down. You have time.

34:53.960 --> 34:54.961
Okay.

34:55.044 --> 34:57.213
And educate students on consent.

34:57.297 --> 34:59.090
Really inspiring to see these young women

34:59.173 --> 35:01.801
working together to effect change,
isn't it, Alex?

35:01.884 --> 35:03.595
Fast learner, our Bradley.

35:04.053 --> 35:06.514
Well, it's Saturday night,
and she has the stage to herself.

35:06.598 --> 35:08.391
Let's not do the hora just yet.

35:08.474 --> 35:11.144
Coming up after the break,
we have one of my personal favorites,

35:11.227 --> 35:13.605
The Pioneer Woman, Ree Drummond.

35:13.688 --> 35:18.401
Alex, growing up on the farm, my mama made
the best grits in all of West Virginia.

35:18.484 --> 35:19.903
Let's see how Ree compares.

35:19.986 --> 35:21.571
Seriously, you guys? This is garbage.

35:21.653 --> 35:25.283
I don't call my mother "Mama,"
and she's also a terrible cook.

35:26.868 --> 35:27.952
I hear you, Bradley.

35:28.035 --> 35:29.120
Do you?

35:29.202 --> 35:31.372
Yeah. We're taking notes.
We're making changes.

35:31.456 --> 35:33.124
How about I do it for you?

35:33.207 --> 35:34.959
Please welcome The Pioneer Woman,

35:35.043 --> 35:37.378
who somehow manages to idealize an era

35:37.461 --> 35:39.964
when women birthed babies
in covered wagons

35:40.048 --> 35:43.508
and died from cholera before
they even had a chance to nurse 'em.

35:44.093 --> 35:45.136
Something like that?

35:48.389 --> 35:52.517
Yo, Jackson. God here.
Let's fix that wardrobe.

35:52.602 --> 35:55.396
Whoever's picking these outfits
should be fired.

35:56.064 --> 35:57.649
Alex picked 'em.

36:05.240 --> 36:07.158
All right, next up,

36:07.242 --> 36:12.247
Lizzy has her mock trial semifinal
on May 3.

36:12.330 --> 36:14.540
Yeah, it's an all-day thing.
I'll cover it.

36:14.624 --> 36:16.125
No. I wanna go to that.

36:16.209 --> 36:17.710
Yeah, it's at Wolcott's.

36:17.794 --> 36:20.880
I refuse to have boarding school mean
that I don't get to see my fucking kid.

36:23.216 --> 36:25.176
I'm gonna get more wine.
Would you like some?

36:25.260 --> 36:27.053
Sure. Why don't you switch to white?

36:27.136 --> 36:28.513
Isn't that stuff giving you headaches?

36:28.596 --> 36:30.723
If I don't take an Advil, okay, Jason?

36:30.807 --> 36:32.392
-Jesus.
-Okay. Jesus Christ.

36:32.475 --> 36:33.601
God.

36:33.685 --> 36:34.852
-Al, Al, Al.
-What?

36:34.936 --> 36:37.105
Oh, God. What is going on?

36:37.188 --> 36:40.775
I just think it's weird that we have to
make a fake family calendar. That's all.

36:40.858 --> 36:42.068
We've always done it.

36:42.151 --> 36:45.947
No, but now it just is--
feels like a game.

36:47.365 --> 36:48.491
Lizzy's stuff is real,

36:48.575 --> 36:52.996
but coordinating my events and you having
to pretend. Come on. It feels weird.

36:53.413 --> 36:55.873
Yes, obviously. It's fucking bizarre.

36:56.499 --> 36:58.251
But, you know, we'll figure it out.

36:58.334 --> 37:01.045
Lizzy's at boarding school now.
She'll be at college in a minute.

37:01.129 --> 37:03.673
Yes, I know. I know.
And I'm thrilled for her.

37:03.756 --> 37:06.134
We raised a beautiful, independent kid,

37:06.217 --> 37:09.345
but would it kill her
to need us a little bit more?

37:09.429 --> 37:11.055
Oh, come on.

37:11.556 --> 37:14.058
Is that really what's bothering you?

37:17.770 --> 37:19.147
Come on.

37:22.859 --> 37:24.527
Page Six thinks I'm crazy.

37:25.528 --> 37:28.948
Page Six thought you were pregnant
ten times last year. Who cares?

37:29.282 --> 37:31.159
Well, I very well might be.

37:31.534 --> 37:33.369
-Excuse me?
-Crazy, not pregnant.

37:33.453 --> 37:37.332
Crazy. I'm--
This article came up the other day.

37:37.415 --> 37:42.921
I googled "Alex and Bradley" 'cause...
I'm fucking human and curious,

37:43.004 --> 37:44.464
and this article popped up

37:44.547 --> 37:49.010
that said I was "wandering the halls
of TMS in the middle of the night."

37:49.594 --> 37:50.595
Were you?

37:51.012 --> 37:52.013
Yes.

37:52.889 --> 37:57.894
But that means that my coworkers
are leaking stories about me.

37:58.519 --> 37:59.729
Mitch is going down,

37:59.812 --> 38:03.024
and somehow stories about me
being crazy are popping up.

38:03.107 --> 38:05.026
How the fuck does that track?

38:05.109 --> 38:07.528
-All right, it's a big change.
-Yes.

38:07.612 --> 38:09.197
You're allowed to feel it.

38:09.280 --> 38:11.366
I know, but I'm the one
who made this big, stupid

38:11.449 --> 38:14.619
Bradley-Jackson,
whoever-the-fuck-that-is move.

38:15.245 --> 38:17.872
I mean, it is crazy.
It's absolutely crazy.

38:18.414 --> 38:21.459
But at first it felt like "I'm in control.
This is a power move."

38:21.542 --> 38:25.630
But I just-- This stupid shitshow,
I'm just-- I'm exhausted.

38:25.713 --> 38:28.716
I'm just so exhausted.

38:29.968 --> 38:32.595
Would it really be so bad
if it all went away?

38:32.679 --> 38:33.680
What?

38:33.763 --> 38:37.141
Oh, come on. A part of you
is trying to blow it all up. Admit it.

38:37.225 --> 38:39.060
Now, come on. I know you.

38:40.061 --> 38:41.271
I get it.

38:41.938 --> 38:45.108
But you've had this
unbelievable run, Alex.

38:46.276 --> 38:48.027
You've earned your freedom.

38:48.945 --> 38:51.197
You've earned your family their freedom.

38:52.949 --> 38:56.369
So, I don't know, maybe this is the moment
you get to choose to stop.

38:58.288 --> 38:59.497
We'll be fine.

39:01.791 --> 39:04.794
Wait. Are you saying that if I quit,
we would be--

39:04.877 --> 39:08.381
Fuck, no, no, I'm--
No, I was not making this about me. Sorry.

39:09.591 --> 39:10.592
Okay.

39:12.176 --> 39:13.428
Thank you for that.

39:14.679 --> 39:16.347
-Thank you.
-Sure.

39:35.533 --> 39:38.286
Am I supposed to be impressed
you can open Barneys?

39:38.369 --> 39:41.247
You're supposed to be impressed
that I've got $30,000

39:41.331 --> 39:43.207
for you to spend on whatever you want.

39:50.548 --> 39:52.258
Do you have a favorite silhouette?

39:52.717 --> 39:53.718
Pants.

39:55.637 --> 40:00.099
Pencil, cigarette, flared,
high-waisted, gaucho, drop-crotch--

40:00.183 --> 40:03.061
You know what? Just bring us a variety.
We trust you.

40:03.144 --> 40:04.896
And throw in some dresses too, please.

40:05.313 --> 40:09.651
I get you're not a typical woman, but
try to see the joy in a wardrobe upgrade.

40:09.734 --> 40:11.277
What is a typical woman?

40:12.862 --> 40:15.448
You know, not everything is a challenge.

40:15.865 --> 40:19.702
People usually say that
when they don't wanna be challenged.

40:19.786 --> 40:21.412
Wow. You're fun.

40:21.496 --> 40:22.497
I'm tired.

40:22.580 --> 40:26.125
And I don't feel like pretending
Pretty Woman is my favorite movie.

40:27.669 --> 40:29.170
What is your favorite movie?

40:29.587 --> 40:31.381
What do you want my favorite movie to be?

40:31.965 --> 40:34.300
I'm beginning to sense
that you're very frustrated.

40:34.384 --> 40:36.010
Look, I don't wanna sound ungrateful.

40:36.094 --> 40:38.680
New clothes are fun. They're--

40:38.763 --> 40:40.139
You know what's even more fun?

40:40.223 --> 40:43.142
Having your image
workshopped by a focus group.

40:43.226 --> 40:46.312
I can't wait to hear
how I'm gonna alienate Americans.

40:46.396 --> 40:50.358
I've been contending with the misogynistic
world of journalism for 15 years.

40:50.441 --> 40:52.694
I've only been told
about a thousand different ways

40:52.777 --> 40:55.780
I'm too liberal,
too conservative, too in-between.

40:55.863 --> 40:58.449
"You've too much chin.
You're not smiling enough.

40:58.533 --> 41:00.743
You're too brunette.
Do you wanna go blonde?

41:00.827 --> 41:01.828
Where are your boobs?

41:01.911 --> 41:04.163
Quick, put your boobs out.
Wait, put your boobs away.

41:04.247 --> 41:06.332
You're attracting men.
You're scaring women.

41:06.708 --> 41:09.502
Try not to be so confrontational.
Men don't wanna fuck you.

41:09.586 --> 41:11.546
Don't be so angry. Women feel criticized."

41:11.629 --> 41:12.797
But here, no, no,

41:12.880 --> 41:17.218
here I'm gonna transform into
the aspirational, inoffensive dream girl.

41:17.302 --> 41:20.179
Here I'm gonna become
the Mother Teresa of the morning news.

41:20.263 --> 41:23.850
Though I'm pretty sure that Mother Teresa
had too many fucking wrinkles for HD.

41:23.933 --> 41:26.060
All right, are we doing this? Let's go.

41:29.355 --> 41:33.276
I'm trying on a lot of clothes
for someone without a signed contract.

41:33.359 --> 41:35.945
It'll be ready tomorrow.
You need a better agent.

41:36.029 --> 41:37.780
My agent is fine.

41:37.864 --> 41:41.784
He's an idiot if he closes at $700,000.

41:43.411 --> 41:45.663
I thought you were trying
to get me on the cheap.

41:46.080 --> 41:48.833
I don't mind paying someone
what I think they're worth.

41:53.004 --> 41:54.047
You're single, right?

41:55.673 --> 41:56.758
Single.

41:56.841 --> 41:58.760
What's that got to do with my contract?

41:59.510 --> 42:02.722
So, you are? That's great.

42:03.139 --> 42:04.223
Good. Keep it that way.

42:04.307 --> 42:07.435
American women, they're getting married
later, often not at all.

42:07.518 --> 42:10.146
Eggs frozen to be used another day,
if at all.

42:10.230 --> 42:12.315
Men to be fucked
but not needed for fulfillment.

42:12.398 --> 42:16.903
That's exciting, that's reality,
and that is not on morning television.

42:18.112 --> 42:19.822
Okay. What do you think of this?

42:20.531 --> 42:21.532
Oh, yeah. Right.

42:23.868 --> 42:26.079
Very Pantsuit Nation.

42:26.663 --> 42:27.705
Fuck off.

42:28.831 --> 42:30.291
No, I love it.

42:30.875 --> 42:34.629
I'm serious. It just, it...
It reminds me of my mom.

42:35.421 --> 42:36.422
Seriously?

42:36.506 --> 42:37.966
My mom is awesome,

42:38.049 --> 42:40.927
and she is gonna love you.

42:41.010 --> 42:44.180
Martha has never seen herself reflected
on The Morning Show.

42:46.349 --> 42:48.768
Is this the mom you took care of
after Daddy left?

42:48.851 --> 42:53.898
Oh, I see. You think of her as, like,
a sad, weak, abandoned woman?

42:53.982 --> 42:55.275
Hey, I didn't say that.

42:56.067 --> 43:00.280
I took care of my mom, in the cooking
her dinner and giving her hugs sense.

43:00.363 --> 43:02.240
Telling her to put her work away
and go to bed.

43:02.323 --> 43:05.910
And I was, you know,
a terrific 12-year-old mom to my mom.

43:07.245 --> 43:08.580
What does she do?

43:08.663 --> 43:10.248
Retired now.

43:10.331 --> 43:13.918
She was a campaign organizer
for progressive women who usually lost.

43:14.586 --> 43:16.254
Martha loved a easy sell.

43:16.921 --> 43:18.381
Like mother, like son.

43:19.173 --> 43:20.174
How so?

43:20.258 --> 43:23.303
Peddling out to America a 40-year-old,
single, childless woman

43:23.386 --> 43:24.554
who's a political independent?

43:24.637 --> 43:26.347
I don't think you're a tough sell.

43:27.473 --> 43:31.102
We already have the housewives
watching TMS.

43:31.185 --> 43:35.231
If we want to win the ratings war,
we need the women who aren't watching,

43:35.315 --> 43:39.027
the ones that don't see themselves
reflected in Ice Queen Alex.

43:39.110 --> 43:41.696
So... be messy.

43:42.488 --> 43:46.075
Let's do segments
on the ways that you haven't "lived up."

43:46.492 --> 43:50.413
Be the narrative real women are living.

45:00.733 --> 45:03.736
There is no way that Ashley
is only one fucking segment.

45:03.820 --> 45:05.989
That's plenty of time
for a good interview.

45:06.364 --> 45:10.410
It is completely disrespectful
to the seriousness of the subject.

45:10.493 --> 45:13.788
I get it. But Ashley is not good.

45:13.871 --> 45:15.915
Oh, my Go-- Okay, hold on a second.

45:15.999 --> 45:18.501
Did you seriously just call her
"not a good victim"?

45:18.585 --> 45:20.044
Look, I read the transcript.

45:20.128 --> 45:22.463
She's superficial, she's inconsistent
in her recounting of the story--

45:22.547 --> 45:25.675
She's completely preoccupied by Mitch,
how he might feel about it.

45:25.758 --> 45:27.260
Okay, so did you bring her in for backup?

45:27.343 --> 45:29.387
-Is that what Mia's doing here?
-I am nobody's backup.

45:29.470 --> 45:30.847
I read the transcript
from your pre-interview.

45:30.930 --> 45:33.141
-I came to my own conclusions.
-Why are you reading my transcripts?

45:33.224 --> 45:34.684
Hey, hey, hey.

45:34.767 --> 45:37.395
Mia's in charge of our Me Too coverage.
She gets what works.

45:37.478 --> 45:39.272
This is not about Me Too, Chip.

45:39.355 --> 45:41.566
This is about us. This is about our show,

45:41.649 --> 45:43.401
how we will be judged by the public.

45:43.484 --> 45:46.905
And if you cut that down, it's gonna look
like a dodge. It just fucking is.

45:46.988 --> 45:49.282
So get this
into your little fucking brains, okay?

45:49.365 --> 45:51.951
I'm doing the interview my way,
and if you have a problem with it,

45:52.035 --> 45:54.495
and if you have a problem with it,
then fucking quit.

46:00.460 --> 46:02.921
Just let her deal with it.
Fuck it. Fuck it.

46:12.722 --> 46:14.515
I'll be on stage in a minute!

46:21.272 --> 46:23.441
You shouldn't do the interview
with Ashley.

46:26.402 --> 46:27.403
Why wouldn't I?

46:29.239 --> 46:30.240
I don't know.

46:31.157 --> 46:35.036
Seems like you wanna create this narrative
about how you're taking control,

46:35.119 --> 46:37.538
how you've been powerless, but...

46:38.998 --> 46:40.583
that's pretty convenient.

46:42.126 --> 46:43.586
What's convenient about it?

46:44.087 --> 46:45.713
You've always had power,

46:45.797 --> 46:49.008
and you know exactly what it looks like
when a woman doesn't.

46:51.386 --> 46:54.847
Mia, I don't think
we've ever known each other that well.

46:57.684 --> 46:58.685
Maybe not,

46:59.185 --> 47:02.146
but it hasn't stopped you
from making assumptions about me.

47:02.230 --> 47:04.482
Yeah. I've made assumptions
about you and Mitch.

47:06.317 --> 47:08.319
I did not approve of that relationship.

47:09.028 --> 47:10.196
Not one bit.

47:11.281 --> 47:13.074
Completely inappropriate.

47:13.992 --> 47:16.202
And I think the world is making that
pretty clear right now.

47:16.286 --> 47:18.329
But what I don't understand
is why is this my fault?

47:18.413 --> 47:19.414
It's not.

47:19.497 --> 47:22.500
But you're not impartial on this subject.
You knew what Mitch was doing.

47:22.584 --> 47:24.043
And you're impartial?

47:25.169 --> 47:27.463
You're producing the person
who'll be doing the interview.

47:27.547 --> 47:29.757
-That's pretty fuckin' transparent.
-This isn't about that.

47:29.841 --> 47:32.510
Well, then what is it about, Mia?
'Cause I'm getting really confused.

47:32.594 --> 47:35.847
I don't ever remember you
confiding in me about Mitch,

47:35.930 --> 47:37.098
asking me for help.

47:37.640 --> 47:40.977
I remember you being pretty capable
of taking good care of yourself.

47:46.024 --> 47:47.817
Do whatever you wanna do with Ashley,

47:47.901 --> 47:49.944
but I'm telling you,
she's enamored of you.

47:50.445 --> 47:52.655
You'll never get to something honest.

47:54.824 --> 47:56.868
And then
you're gonna get crucified for it.

48:11.174 --> 48:12.550
God.

48:16.554 --> 48:18.514
So, one big happy family.

48:18.598 --> 48:20.391
Yeah. With an absent mother.

48:20.475 --> 48:22.769
I, honestly, was shocked
that she agreed to a run-through.

48:22.852 --> 48:24.395
Not exactly a team player?

48:24.812 --> 48:27.815
Alex requires
a fair amount of personal space.

48:27.899 --> 48:29.192
It's just who she is.

48:29.692 --> 48:31.569
Okay, so, Alex is in a meeting.

48:31.653 --> 48:33.905
We're gonna mark some transitions
without her.

48:34.364 --> 48:36.991
Daniel,
do you mind playing Alex for a bit?

48:40.203 --> 48:41.746
-Don't mind at all.
-Okay.

48:46.793 --> 48:47.794
This way.

48:48.836 --> 48:49.837
Okay.

48:49.921 --> 48:51.047
Speaking of family,

48:51.130 --> 48:54.133
we know how hard it is to make
your kid's lunch quick and healthy,

48:54.217 --> 48:56.844
but luckily, multitasking mom Margaret M--

48:57.262 --> 49:00.056
multitasking mom Margaret Mapel...

49:00.139 --> 49:03.601
Okay. Can we run that back?
That's a lot of alliteration.

49:04.644 --> 49:06.729
-I'm not looking for sympathy.
-I'm not offering any.

49:07.730 --> 49:10.108
All right. Going again,
let's take it from the top.

49:10.191 --> 49:12.235
Here we go.
Starting with Bradley's line.

49:12.318 --> 49:13.695
Everyone quiet, please.

49:13.778 --> 49:15.446
You're doing great.
Just take a deep breath.

49:15.530 --> 49:16.739
Mia, thanks for showing up.

49:17.615 --> 49:19.742
Sorry. Dealing with some changes.

49:20.535 --> 49:22.870
You are doing the interview with Ashley.

49:23.329 --> 49:25.915
We've pushed it to the end of the week
so we can prepare.

49:25.999 --> 49:27.625
Wait, what?

49:28.918 --> 49:31.170
Yeah. Alex just told me on her way out.

49:32.046 --> 49:33.548
On her way out?

49:33.631 --> 49:34.632
What, she's leaving?

49:35.466 --> 49:36.467
Yeah.

49:36.551 --> 49:39.220
Wait, when is she gonna rehearse
with me? On air?

49:40.680 --> 49:43.266
Bradley, this run-through is going well.
Just push through.

49:43.349 --> 49:45.894
Oh, hell no! No, no, no.

49:45.977 --> 49:48.271
I'm not going on tomorrow
if we don't rehearse.

49:48.354 --> 49:50.773
Bra-- Hey!
Don't let her walk out of this--

49:52.025 --> 49:53.192
Great.

49:54.360 --> 49:55.361
Great.

49:56.696 --> 49:58.907
Hey! Alex!

50:00.825 --> 50:02.410
Hey! Alex. Alex.

50:05.914 --> 50:07.874
Why are you not going through
the run-through?

50:07.957 --> 50:09.959
We moved the Ashley interview
to the end of the week,

50:10.043 --> 50:11.544
so I gotta go home and prep a new story.

50:11.628 --> 50:13.338
Why are you giving me the interview?

50:14.172 --> 50:15.632
Because it's better for the show.

50:16.007 --> 50:17.383
Why are you doing this to me?

50:17.926 --> 50:20.428
Doing what?
Handing you an amazing opportunity?

50:20.511 --> 50:21.846
No. You're making no sense.

50:21.930 --> 50:23.765
You're not being present.

50:23.848 --> 50:25.058
What the fuck?

50:25.141 --> 50:26.768
I don't have all the answers.

50:26.851 --> 50:28.478
And why does this have to be about you?

50:28.561 --> 50:30.980
'Cause I'm a woman who has a life.
You realize that?

50:31.064 --> 50:33.358
I have people I'm responsible for,

50:33.441 --> 50:36.486
and I have career aspirations
that don't involve being your sidekick.

50:36.569 --> 50:39.864
You are not my sidekick. You're my cohost.

50:40.990 --> 50:43.910
Well, you have barely acknowledged me
all weekend.

50:46.037 --> 50:49.707
I didn't know that you needed me
to hold your hand.

50:50.208 --> 50:51.542
I need a partner.

50:52.335 --> 50:54.212
Sometimes partners hold hands.

50:59.133 --> 51:00.385
Oh, Jesus.

51:01.636 --> 51:02.762
Okay.

51:03.680 --> 51:04.681
Bradley...

51:06.182 --> 51:09.060
I don't have a fucking clue
what I'm doing.

51:11.479 --> 51:13.523
-You don't?
-Nope. Not a clue.

51:14.566 --> 51:15.942
Running on instinct.

51:16.609 --> 51:17.944
But I know that I need a second

51:18.027 --> 51:21.072
so I can get my shit together
to go on air tomorrow.

51:22.448 --> 51:25.743
And I know I have to not be in that
building with those fucking people

51:25.827 --> 51:28.121
who are constantly judging my choices.

51:32.375 --> 51:35.295
I honestly don't know why I picked you.

51:35.920 --> 51:37.505
Okay? That's the truth.

51:39.132 --> 51:40.967
Just an impulse, and I went with it.

51:43.136 --> 51:45.930
But I do know that I think I like you.

51:50.727 --> 51:52.228
Just go sign your contract.

51:55.231 --> 51:56.232
All right.

51:57.066 --> 51:58.276
Okay.

52:00.278 --> 52:01.571
Watch your step.
