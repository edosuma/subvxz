WEBVTT

00:36.494 --> 00:38.872
Okay, I'm at my turnaround point.

00:39.372 --> 00:41.958
My breathing has just turned labored.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.543
Just a little further, Bobby.

00:43.626 --> 00:45.420
Flora, unexceptional.

00:45.503 --> 00:47.756
Fauna, one box turtle. I'm sorry, Hank.

00:47.839 --> 00:49.466
This will not make my article

00:49.549 --> 00:52.886
of "Arlen's Unforgettable Hikes
You Can Not Afford To Miss."

00:52.969 --> 00:54.929
But we haven't gotten
to the best part yet.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.515
Wait till you see
the Teakettle of the Mount.

00:57.599 --> 01:01.603
For years, this miracle of erosion
has been a symbol of Arlen.

01:01.686 --> 01:03.354
Now, I know what you'll be thinking.

01:03.438 --> 01:07.025
Could Mother Nature carve a hill
to look just like a teakettle,

01:07.108 --> 01:09.110
or did early man help her out?

01:09.194 --> 01:11.571
-Well, that's part of the fun of...
Hey, look.

01:11.654 --> 01:13.239
We're passing a dump.

01:15.742 --> 01:17.035
The Teakettle.

01:17.118 --> 01:21.206


01:21.915 --> 01:23.124
And the graffiti.

01:23.249 --> 01:25.960
You know, if the Class of '02
really "ruled,"

01:26.044 --> 01:27.754
they wouldn't need to write it on a rock.

01:27.837 --> 01:29.130
You know what we need to do?

01:29.214 --> 01:32.425
We need to march right up there
and clean up the Teakettle

01:32.509 --> 01:35.512
and then march right back down
and clean my bathroom.

01:35.595 --> 01:39.140
I say, since alien explorers
constructed the Teakettle,

01:39.224 --> 01:41.017
it's their job to maintain it.

01:41.101 --> 01:45.396
We can't wait for alien explorers
to solve all our problems, Dale.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.316
I'm going to the Mayor and demand action.

01:48.399 --> 01:49.234
Bah.

01:49.317 --> 01:52.028
That Mayor is a shell,
a mere husk of a man.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.989
The real power is with
that new City Manager.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.951
He tells the Mayor
when to jump and how high

01:58.034 --> 01:59.994
and often where to land.

02:00.078 --> 02:03.498
Is that the guy who turned the hoses
on the street musicians?

02:04.165 --> 02:05.083
Good man.

02:08.211 --> 02:09.462
That's my dad and me

02:09.546 --> 02:10.922
in front of the Teakettle.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.801
I'm, uh, pretending I'm a teakettle.

02:16.052 --> 02:18.513
So how quickly you think
you can get a crew up there?

02:18.596 --> 02:20.557
It's about 3:30 right now.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.184
Hank, I wish I had the money
to clean your rock.

02:23.268 --> 02:25.186
Heck, I wish I had the money
to pipe hot fudge

02:25.270 --> 02:26.646
into every house in Arlen.

02:26.729 --> 02:28.231
Who's talking about that?

02:28.314 --> 02:30.775
But I was hired away
from Henrietta, Oklahoma,

02:30.859 --> 02:33.153
to get Arlen's financial house in order.

02:33.236 --> 02:36.030
Now, should I spend
the town's limited funds

02:36.114 --> 02:37.907
on fire engines and police cars

02:37.991 --> 02:40.493
or on helping you
recapture your childhood?

02:40.577 --> 02:42.954
-Well, I never said I...
-Excuse me.

02:43.037 --> 02:46.708
Mr. Gilbert, I am a member
of either the fourth or fifth estate,

02:46.791 --> 02:48.543
the journalistic community.

02:48.626 --> 02:52.463
How would you like the Arlen <i>Bystander's</i>
endorsement next election?

02:52.547 --> 02:54.257
I'm appointed, not elected.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.300
Oh.

02:55.383 --> 02:57.844
Well, how would you like
to get a recipe published?

02:57.927 --> 02:59.053
Folks, if you'll excuse me,

02:59.137 --> 03:01.890
Henrietta, Oklahoma,
didn't turn itself around,

03:01.973 --> 03:03.099
and neither will Arlen.

03:05.602 --> 03:08.188
Mister, you are just asking for a letter.

03:11.399 --> 03:13.151
I am not gonna let this go.

03:13.234 --> 03:15.278
If the city won't help me
clean up the Teakettle,

03:15.361 --> 03:16.487
I'll clean it up myself.

03:16.571 --> 03:19.032
And I will cover your story
in the <i>Bystander.</i>

03:19.115 --> 03:23.369
I'll rally hundreds of affluent, active,
slightly elderly readers.

03:23.453 --> 03:26.122
Hey, maybe you can write
something about the Teakettle's history.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.249
Show everyone why it's so important.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.376
You fight the impossible fight.

03:30.460 --> 03:32.587
I will make it important.

03:42.931 --> 03:44.015
Teakettle, eh?

03:44.349 --> 03:46.100
-Someone jump from it?
-No.

03:46.517 --> 03:49.729
-Hmm... Helicopter smash into it?
-No.

03:49.812 --> 03:52.941
Well, a word of advice
from one scribe to another.

03:53.024 --> 03:55.735
Our readers like stories
they like to read.

03:55.818 --> 03:57.403
The Teakettle's a loser.

03:57.487 --> 03:58.696
Abandon ship.

04:09.916 --> 04:11.167
I worked all day

04:11.251 --> 04:13.211
and barely scratched the surface.

04:13.294 --> 04:14.754
Oh, don't give up hope.

04:14.837 --> 04:18.424
It turns out that the kettle
was a big name draw in its day.

04:18.675 --> 04:22.178
President Garfield was here
before his assassination.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.640
And look, the Texas Rangers
built a fort next to it.

04:25.974 --> 04:29.185
There is
the 1884 Notre Dame football team...

04:29.269 --> 04:30.561
and Mark Twain...

04:30.812 --> 04:33.648
Wow, the Texas Rangers and Mark Twain.

04:34.023 --> 04:35.233
Our little Teakettle, huh?

04:35.316 --> 04:36.484
And there's more.

04:36.567 --> 04:38.778
Arlen used to be called "Harlen,"

04:38.861 --> 04:40.822
but over the years, the "H" was dropped.

04:40.905 --> 04:44.033
Maybe someday Houston will become Ouston.

04:44.117 --> 04:45.285
Who are these ladies?

04:45.368 --> 04:46.911
You are not gonna believe this,

04:46.995 --> 04:49.080
but Arlen was founded by women.

04:49.163 --> 04:52.959
This one lady here
owned the largest pork ranchero in town,

04:53.042 --> 04:56.170
and this one was one
of the Governor's closest advisors.

04:56.546 --> 04:58.089
Well, keep digging, Peggy.

04:58.172 --> 04:59.799
This is the kind of gold we need.

04:59.882 --> 05:01.718
Oh, I'll dig all right, Hank.

05:01.801 --> 05:03.219
My brain is a shovel.

05:05.805 --> 05:09.100
Bob, these archives only go back to 1870.

05:09.183 --> 05:11.728
Where are the earliest issues
of the <i>Bystander</i> kept?

05:11.811 --> 05:12.854
Couldn't say.

05:13.104 --> 05:15.148
There is an old closet in the break room.

05:15.356 --> 05:16.524
But it's sealed off

05:16.607 --> 05:17.900
-by the fridge.
-Oh.

05:18.234 --> 05:19.152
Too bad.

05:19.235 --> 05:21.321
Looks like your story ends there.

05:40.923 --> 05:44.052
It wouldn't be work, Bobby.
It would be a "work party."

05:44.135 --> 05:46.512
You and your friends
would be scrubbing the Teakettle,

05:46.596 --> 05:50.433
but you'd also be listening to the radio
and taking short breaks.

05:50.850 --> 05:54.854
Let me tell you what I like
and don't like about that idea.

05:57.565 --> 05:58.608
Hill residence.

05:58.691 --> 06:00.318
Meet me at the Bystander. Now.

06:02.779 --> 06:03.946
What's going on, Peggy?

06:04.030 --> 06:06.115
Did someone put a possum
in your desk again?

06:06.199 --> 06:11.371
Hank, dignitaries and Notre Dame athletes
never came to Arlen to see the Teakettle.

06:11.454 --> 06:13.873
Well, of course, they did.
You showed me the pictures.

06:13.956 --> 06:15.875
That was a convenient cover story.

06:15.958 --> 06:18.795
The real attraction
was something far different.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.090
Hank, before Arlen was Harlen,
it was called...

06:22.256 --> 06:23.674
"Harlottown?"

06:23.758 --> 06:24.675
What does that mean?

06:24.759 --> 06:26.386
Harlot town. Town of harlots.

06:26.469 --> 06:29.180
Call girls, molls, pink pants,
prostitutes.

06:29.263 --> 06:33.768
Our beloved Arlen began life
as the most notorious brothel in Texas.

06:33.851 --> 06:34.685
What?

06:34.769 --> 06:36.354
Harlottown became Harlen

06:36.437 --> 06:38.523
because people were in
such a rush to get here,

06:38.606 --> 06:40.691
they didn't have time to say "Harlottown."

06:40.775 --> 06:42.777
But the Texas Rangers...

06:42.860 --> 06:44.195
They were johns, Hank.

06:45.822 --> 06:46.989
I know this is hard.

06:47.448 --> 06:50.243
Maybe this <i>Katzenjammer Kids</i> comic
will give you a chuckle.

06:55.540 --> 06:57.291
I can't believe they're...

06:57.375 --> 07:00.378
How could they even find 11 women
who would do that?

07:00.461 --> 07:05.007
My research shows that Arlen started off
as a watering hole on the Chisholm Trail.

07:05.091 --> 07:08.177
Some enterprising women
invested in a tent and a cot

07:08.261 --> 07:09.679
and Harlottown was born.

07:09.762 --> 07:11.139
Great reporting, Peggy.

07:11.222 --> 07:14.225
Let's get all your notes in one place
and I'll fire up the grill.

07:14.308 --> 07:16.978
Hank, you are not burning
my story on the patio.

07:17.270 --> 07:19.063
I am a journalist,

07:19.147 --> 07:22.275
and I will not kill a story
because it's unpleasant.

07:22.358 --> 07:25.611
Sooner or later,
the sun is gonna crash into the Earth.

07:25.695 --> 07:29.532
And if I survive,
it will be my duty to report it.

07:29.615 --> 07:32.618
You can't tell the town
it was conceived in sin.

07:32.702 --> 07:33.703
I have to.

07:33.786 --> 07:35.913
Now if you'll excuse me, I am on deadline.

07:38.082 --> 07:41.043
"Even with a thousand head of cattle
to keep them company,

07:41.127 --> 07:42.712
cowboys would get lonely..."

07:45.882 --> 07:49.969
"During the 19th century,
the Teakettle was so popular

07:50.052 --> 07:53.055
that when a gentleman
went to sample a harlot's wares,

07:53.139 --> 07:56.309
it was said that he had
gone 'teakettling.'"

07:58.519 --> 08:00.188
If I'd been around back then,

08:00.271 --> 08:03.816
maybe I would have rescued
one of those teakettling ladies,

08:03.900 --> 08:05.443
and she would have been grateful

08:05.526 --> 08:07.904
and lived on a farm with me
for a few years

08:07.987 --> 08:10.364
till she ran away
with a traveling preacher.

08:11.824 --> 08:14.202
Dad, the City Manager is on the phone.

08:14.285 --> 08:18.080
He wants you and Mom in his office ASAP.

08:20.791 --> 08:22.168
I want to apologize

08:22.251 --> 08:24.337
for my wife, she made a mistake.

08:24.420 --> 08:28.007
How about she publishes a retraction,
does a couple of jury duties

08:28.090 --> 08:29.550
and we forget this ever happened?

08:29.634 --> 08:31.010
There was no mistake.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.637
I don't care if you throw me in jail,

08:32.720 --> 08:34.680
I am not revealing my sources.

08:34.764 --> 08:37.934
Aren't your sources
just old newspaper clippings?

08:39.185 --> 08:40.770
I will neither confirm nor deny.

08:40.853 --> 08:43.022
No, you don't understand,
I loved your article.

08:43.481 --> 08:44.357
It got me thinking,

08:44.440 --> 08:45.942
we should clean up the Teakettle,

08:46.025 --> 08:48.569
share our town's colorful history
with the world.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.947
What? Maybe I'm missing something here,

08:51.030 --> 08:54.200
but if we tell people
we were founded by prostitutes,

08:54.325 --> 08:55.284
they'll know.

08:55.409 --> 08:57.203
That was over a hundred years ago.

08:57.286 --> 08:58.955
When people look back on...

08:59.038 --> 09:01.374
Wait, I have an equation to explain this.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.086
Scandal plus time

09:05.169 --> 09:07.004
equals tourist dollars.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.631
Look at Salem, Massachusetts.

09:08.714 --> 09:11.259
Almost everyone thinks
burning witches is bad now,

09:11.342 --> 09:14.971
but Salem is using their unique past
to bring in tourist dollars.

09:15.054 --> 09:18.683
I've been there, Hank.
They have a sewer system par excellence.

09:18.766 --> 09:20.434
Plus, it's educational.

09:20.518 --> 09:24.397
Hank, if we do not learn from the past,
what's the point of even having one?

09:24.480 --> 09:26.065
That's going in the brochure.

09:27.066 --> 09:29.068
Hank, it is really no big deal.

09:29.151 --> 09:32.446
I mean, you never objected
to Miss Kitty on <i>Gunsmoke.</i>

09:32.530 --> 09:33.447
What about her?

09:33.531 --> 09:36.033
Come on, they had
all those rooms upstairs,

09:36.117 --> 09:38.202
she didn't charge enough for drinks.

09:39.036 --> 09:40.705
Not Miss Kitty.

09:43.332 --> 09:47.712
Dad, what did the men do all day
when the women were out prostituting?

09:47.795 --> 09:48.921
Aah.

09:49.005 --> 09:50.548
Did your mother write another article?

09:50.631 --> 09:53.050
No, it's my history homework.

09:53.134 --> 09:57.138
Hank Hill. Kahn Jr. just ask me
how much hugs cost in 1870.

09:57.221 --> 09:59.265
This your wife Peggy Hill's fault.

09:59.348 --> 10:02.393
The kind of thing we should cover up,
not teach our kids.

10:02.476 --> 10:04.270
You don't have to tell me.

10:04.562 --> 10:05.521
Peggy.

10:05.605 --> 10:06.897
She's not home, Dad.

10:06.981 --> 10:09.483
She's at some committee meeting
for the Teakettle.

10:09.567 --> 10:11.652
Oh, God, now's there's a committee?

10:11.736 --> 10:14.238
That's the last step before a task force.

10:14.322 --> 10:15.573
I got to get down there.

10:15.656 --> 10:16.574
I go with you.

10:16.657 --> 10:20.036
We really tear into Peggy Hill
and those other pervs.

10:21.162 --> 10:22.747
<i>♪ I'm going to Harlottown ♪</i>

10:22.830 --> 10:25.958
<i>♪ Where the gals treat a gent
with two dimes like a king ♪</i>

10:26.042 --> 10:27.293
<i>♪ Yes, Harlottown ♪</i>

10:27.376 --> 10:30.504
<i>♪ Where you only have to ask
to get most everything ♪</i>

10:31.422 --> 10:33.424
This is fantastic.

10:33.507 --> 10:34.884
Look at all these treasures.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.177
Oh, it would be a crime

10:36.260 --> 10:37.887
if we didn't put them
on display somewhere.

10:37.970 --> 10:41.682
Are you talking the main glass case
at the central library?

10:41.766 --> 10:43.726
Bigger. I'm talking about a museum.

10:44.226 --> 10:46.812
Our very own historical museum.

10:47.271 --> 10:49.357
The Arlen Heritage Museum.

10:49.649 --> 10:51.859
What could be more educational than that?

10:51.942 --> 10:56.030
-Yeah. Museum sounds classy.
-You haven't voted yet, have you?

10:56.113 --> 10:57.698
Because we vote "nay."

10:57.782 --> 10:58.949
Careful, Hank.

10:59.033 --> 11:02.078
That is an important artifact
for the Arlen Heritage Museum.

11:03.537 --> 11:07.375
"Shave: 25 cents,
deluxe shave: four dollars"?

11:07.458 --> 11:09.919
-Oh, God.
-What you people doing?

11:10.002 --> 11:13.381
I didn't move out of cesspool of Anaheim
to let you wreck this little town.

11:13.464 --> 11:15.007
Kahn, you surprise me.

11:15.091 --> 11:17.885
I thought you were
the more sophisticated type.

11:17.968 --> 11:19.053
Huh? Uh, oh...

11:19.136 --> 11:22.348
Oh, Ted, I not see you there. I... uh...

11:22.640 --> 11:25.601
Oh, this the kind of stuff
you talking about for museum.

11:25.685 --> 11:27.645
Oh... very progressive.

11:27.728 --> 11:28.729
I'm in.

11:31.065 --> 11:35.152
Instead of teaching this stuff to our kids
and building a museum of shame,

11:35.236 --> 11:38.197
why don't we celebrate
the things our town is proud of.

11:38.280 --> 11:42.618
The Arlen Soldier and Sailor's Home,
the petrified wood collection...

11:42.702 --> 11:46.497
That will all be there, too, Hank,
but the founding mothers are the money.

11:46.580 --> 11:47.748
Mm-hmm.

11:49.917 --> 11:51.210
Okay, then,

11:51.335 --> 11:54.588
it seems like just about everybody
wants to move forward on this.

11:54.672 --> 11:55.548
The question is,

11:55.631 --> 11:59.301
"What's the best way to tell the world
about Arlen's rebirth?"

11:59.385 --> 12:02.972
Idea. What if we renamed
the upcoming Arlen Days Festival

12:03.055 --> 12:04.348
"Harlottown Days?"

12:04.432 --> 12:06.267
I would be willing
to dress up like a sheriff.

12:06.350 --> 12:07.435
I'll be your deputy.

12:12.898 --> 12:16.569
Sign a petition and get a free gift.
A clean town.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.612
You know what I like about you, Hank?

12:18.696 --> 12:21.365
You don't care
how unpopular your ideas are.

12:21.449 --> 12:22.742
Unpopular, huh?

12:22.825 --> 12:25.494
Well, Mr. Coyle here
happens to agree with me

12:25.578 --> 12:27.121
that we don't need this museum.

12:27.204 --> 12:30.458
Oh. I thought this petition
was in favor of the museum.

12:30.541 --> 12:33.169
I can't wait for Harlottown Days.

13:01.822 --> 13:03.365
Save Arlen's virtue.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.284
Hey, Sheriff Ted,

13:05.367 --> 13:08.454
maybe we should arrest Hank
for disorderly fuddy-duddiness.

13:11.916 --> 13:12.958
Hey, Hank, look.

13:14.293 --> 13:17.087
I'm proposing this is what
all the tour guides will wear.

13:17.171 --> 13:19.256
Is everyone having fun?

13:19.340 --> 13:22.134
Harlottown Days has been
a smashing success.

13:22.218 --> 13:25.387
Everything is on track to make Arlen
not just a tourist stop,

13:25.471 --> 13:26.764
but a destination.

13:28.265 --> 13:30.726
That means lower taxes, new street signs,

13:30.810 --> 13:32.603
fire trucks and police cars.

13:32.686 --> 13:35.022
And it's all gonna begin right here
in the center of town

13:35.105 --> 13:38.108
where we're gonna convert the musty old
Soldier and Sailor's Home

13:38.192 --> 13:41.904
into the new Arlen Museum of Prostitution.

13:41.987 --> 13:44.615
"Why don't you come up
and see us sometime?"

13:44.698 --> 13:46.826
Arlen Museum of... Well, I don't...

13:47.785 --> 13:49.245
An erotic bakery?

13:49.787 --> 13:51.413
A gentlemen's reading room?

13:51.497 --> 13:52.748
Where's the crafts wing?

13:52.832 --> 13:54.500
Where's the empowerment exhibit?

13:54.583 --> 13:55.417
And now,

13:55.501 --> 13:56.502
the big news.

13:56.585 --> 13:59.964
Apparently, the secret
of our little town has gotten out,

14:00.047 --> 14:05.594
and Arlen is the new home
of the Texas Adult Video Awards.

14:05.678 --> 14:07.137
Adult video?

14:07.221 --> 14:08.556
Oh, God.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.058
As we speak,
they are rolling out the red carpet

14:11.141 --> 14:15.729
at the Arlen Junior College Auditorium
for the Adult World's shiniest stars.

14:36.917 --> 14:39.169
I should have just let history
stay buried.

14:39.253 --> 14:42.840
I should have stuck to my old beat
of reviewing pancake houses.

14:42.923 --> 14:44.675
Yeah, well, you were good at that.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.387
Let's get going.

14:48.470 --> 14:51.348
The porn people
will be hitting town any moment.

14:54.143 --> 14:55.686
Why are we going to Durndle?

14:55.769 --> 15:00.691
No offense, Dad, but you're not
a let's-just-go-to-Durndle kind of guy.

15:00.774 --> 15:03.777
Uh, I just thought it'd be nice
to get out of town.

15:05.112 --> 15:07.364
-Looks like a breakdown...
-It's some of...

15:08.157 --> 15:09.033
them.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.951
Now, we shouldn't jump to...

15:11.619 --> 15:14.413
Oh, God, a sport jacket with no shirt.

15:14.496 --> 15:16.540
Well, maybe they are...

15:17.166 --> 15:20.127
that way, but they're also
disabled motorists.

15:20.210 --> 15:21.587
We have a duty.

15:21.670 --> 15:23.589
Peggy, watch the boy.

15:25.049 --> 15:28.677
What's the problem, Randy?
We did a whole movie about a flat tire.

15:28.761 --> 15:30.179
I'm trying, okay?

15:30.262 --> 15:32.139
Uh, you folks need a hand?

15:32.222 --> 15:34.516
Hey, this part happened in the movie, too.

15:35.476 --> 15:37.478
Thank you. I cannot be late tonight.

15:37.561 --> 15:39.313
I'm getting a lifetime achievement award.

15:39.647 --> 15:42.524
Well, congratulations, I suppose.

15:47.488 --> 15:49.990
You do know your transmission
is shot, right?

15:50.074 --> 15:52.993
Uh, can we borrow your transmission?
I mean, just for tonight?

15:53.077 --> 15:55.037
Just get in the truck.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.790
I guess we can drop you off
at your awards show.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.625
Hank, what are you doing?

15:59.708 --> 16:02.795
Peggy, they tried to fix their engine
by changing the tire.

16:02.878 --> 16:03.921
They'll die out here.

16:05.381 --> 16:07.591
Wow. A real limo.

16:07.675 --> 16:09.677
I wish I could have ridden in that.

16:10.260 --> 16:11.720
You ever been in one, Mom?

16:11.804 --> 16:14.890
Have I.
If I had attended my prom, certainly.

16:16.600 --> 16:19.853
So how did you folks get into the movies?

16:23.565 --> 16:25.651
Hank? Bobby?

16:25.734 --> 16:28.487
Hi, John Redcorn.
Were you heading someplace?

16:29.405 --> 16:30.656
I have a gala.

16:30.739 --> 16:33.784
Well, I was hoping
you could look after Bobby for a bit.

16:33.867 --> 16:35.452
It's kind of important.

16:39.790 --> 16:41.291
Would you like an organic Pop-tart?

16:44.670 --> 16:48.048
You've sure got a lot less pawn shops
than where we usually have these things.

16:48.590 --> 16:49.466
What's that?

16:49.550 --> 16:51.510
That's the old Arlen water tower.

16:51.593 --> 16:53.178
It sure is beautiful.

16:53.262 --> 16:57.599
Beautiful and it has more rivets
than any structure in Central Texas.

16:58.058 --> 17:00.644
You know, I grew up
in a small town just like Arlen.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.688
Of course, I can never go back.

17:02.771 --> 17:05.357
Well, you still have your... career?

17:05.816 --> 17:06.650
Hobby?

17:07.192 --> 17:08.068
Career?

17:08.152 --> 17:11.447
Actually the lifetime achievement award
is more of a kiss-off.

17:11.530 --> 17:13.157
It's like the industry's saying,

17:13.240 --> 17:16.368
"Thanks for the 400 movies,
we're real tired of seeing you do it."

17:16.452 --> 17:18.162
Uh... right.

17:18.245 --> 17:21.206
So, you're out of the business.
What's next for Candee?

17:21.290 --> 17:23.625
Well, I used to dream
of having my own little shop

17:23.709 --> 17:26.795
selling baby jewelry
or sparkly tennis shoes.

17:26.962 --> 17:30.090
But who would want to buy that stuff
from someone with my past?

17:33.177 --> 17:35.637
You know, Candee,
the women who started this town

17:35.721 --> 17:38.098
were of, uh, similar repute.

17:38.182 --> 17:40.642
But the moment they had
a chance to quit, they did.

17:40.726 --> 17:42.227
Look, that granary was built

17:42.311 --> 17:44.354
by our founding mothers.

17:44.438 --> 17:46.565
And that pork processing plant.

17:48.108 --> 17:50.736
I thought places like this
only existed in the movies.

17:51.195 --> 17:52.571
Not my movies.

17:52.654 --> 17:55.199
Yeah, well, thanks
to our new city manager,

17:55.282 --> 17:58.869
and your awards show,
and the Museum of Prostitution,

17:58.952 --> 18:00.704
it's pretty much never gonna be the same.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.956
This is wrong, Hank.

18:03.040 --> 18:05.125
And believe me, I know wrong.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.169
There has to be something we can do.

18:23.310 --> 18:24.228
Candee, where were you?

18:24.311 --> 18:26.021
We almost gave
the lifetime achievement award

18:26.105 --> 18:27.147
to someone else.

18:27.940 --> 18:29.024
Do you know your lines, Hank?

18:29.108 --> 18:30.651
Yep.

18:32.069 --> 18:34.696
These decorations
look tacky and inappropriate.

18:34.780 --> 18:39.243
Yeah, when I played this out in my head,
things looked a lot better.

18:41.286 --> 18:42.663
Especially the people.

18:42.746 --> 18:44.289
Good evening, everyone.

18:44.373 --> 18:47.084
Today marks the beginning
of a special relationship

18:47.167 --> 18:49.419
between Arlen and the adult film industry.

18:49.503 --> 18:52.172
So, welcome, Texas Adult Video Awards,

18:52.256 --> 18:54.925
to Arlen. "Come up and see us sometime."

18:55.217 --> 18:56.051
And now,

18:56.135 --> 18:57.469
the stars come out.

18:57.553 --> 19:00.889
The recipient
of the Lifetime Achievement Award,

19:00.973 --> 19:02.808
Candee Lace.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.313
Thank you, everyone.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.440
I want you all to meet the man
who made it possible

19:10.524 --> 19:13.110
for me to be here tonight, Hank Hill.

19:14.361 --> 19:17.364
-Hank?
-Who's he? Is that her first director?

19:17.447 --> 19:19.241
No, that would be Nicholas Ruggles.

19:19.324 --> 19:22.452
You all know I've played
a lot of love scenes in the movies,

19:22.536 --> 19:26.081
but today,
I fell head over heels for real.

19:26.165 --> 19:28.959
I'm announcing my retirement
from the adult film business

19:29.042 --> 19:32.629
so I can be with my true love, Arlen.

19:33.964 --> 19:36.967
No offense, guys, but I don't want
this kind of smut in my town.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.513
We have a choice to make.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.640
Which version of Arlen do we want?

19:43.724 --> 19:47.019
The uncut, X-rated one
with shocking footage,

19:47.102 --> 19:51.190
or the PG one that's grown-up
but still appropriate for kids?

19:53.567 --> 19:58.488
Now, who here wants to sign my petition
to turn Harlottown back to Arlen?

19:58.572 --> 19:59.489
I do, Hank.

20:02.367 --> 20:05.370
-Now, who else?
-Petitions, I've got petitions.

20:05.454 --> 20:07.164
Share the pens, people.

20:07.247 --> 20:09.416
Let's take a deep breath, everyone.

20:09.499 --> 20:11.710
In my Arlen,
there won't be any parking meters.

20:11.793 --> 20:13.086
Property taxes slashed.

20:13.170 --> 20:14.504
Free garbage pickup.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.839
I'm the candyman.

20:16.256 --> 20:18.342
"Arlen, come up and see us sometime."

20:18.425 --> 20:20.886
"Arlen, come up and see us sometime."

20:20.969 --> 20:23.347
Huh, kind of puts a new complexion
on things

20:23.430 --> 20:25.641
when sleazy people think we're too sleazy.

20:26.016 --> 20:29.186
You know, I was the first person
to come to Hank Hill's side on this.

20:31.104 --> 20:32.314
Thank you, Mayor.

20:32.648 --> 20:36.860
Looks like decency
isn't so unpopular after all, eh, Vance?

20:44.826 --> 20:45.744
Wow.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.038
She really cleaned up nice.

20:48.121 --> 20:52.167
"In 1902, Mark Twain stood
on this very spot

20:52.251 --> 20:54.920
and remarked on Arlen's natural beauty."

20:55.003 --> 20:58.090
Dad, this was almost worth the hike.

20:58.173 --> 21:00.259
I don't want to take my eyes off of it.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.594
I don't know how to thank you
for everything, Hank.

21:02.886 --> 21:04.471
Can I get you another pair of shoes?

21:05.973 --> 21:07.849
No, no. These are fine.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.978
Fine? They're great.

21:48.557 --> 21:49.933
-<i>I have a gala.</i>
