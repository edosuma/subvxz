11:10.692 --> 11:12.696
So when did you get out of prison?

11:13.876 --> 11:15.765
About three weeks ago.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.309
And how did you find us?

11:18.334 --> 11:22.423
Oh, simple, I contacted Mountie
Headquarters in Cape Fullerton.

11:23.023 --> 11:24.503
I would have gone to your mother's

11:24.528 --> 11:25.694
if I knew where she was.

11:25.719 --> 11:29.296
She has a new life, it
doesn't include you.

11:29.321 --> 11:32.773
Yeah, you said that in a letter
you sent a few years back.

11:32.889 --> 11:37.209
The same letter that told me
my only daughter had died.

11:38.767 --> 11:41.507
Yeah, well there was no easy
way to tell you about Colleen.

11:41.532 --> 11:44.559
I haven't heard a word from
any of you since then.

11:44.584 --> 11:46.374
That's the last time.

11:47.051 --> 11:52.307
Nathan, I have done my time,
I am a different man.

11:53.485 --> 11:54.707
How?

11:54.732 --> 11:57.411
Well, I quit gambling for one.

11:57.436 --> 12:00.849
And that was the start
of this whole trouble.

12:01.303 --> 12:02.749
I have heard that one before.

12:02.774 --> 12:04.394
But this time...

12:04.816 --> 12:07.371
This time I mean it. I mean it, son...

12:07.396 --> 12:09.527
Dad... Archie.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.306
I am not doing this again.

12:16.129 --> 12:18.897
Fine if you want to turn your
back on your own father.

12:18.922 --> 12:20.254
Yeah, that's just fine.

12:20.279 --> 12:21.957
But I have a grand-daughter

12:21.982 --> 12:24.441
that I intend to spend some time with.

12:28.388 --> 12:29.688
That's not happening.

12:29.713 --> 12:30.751
You can't stop me.

12:30.776 --> 12:32.151
Yes, I can.

12:32.176 --> 12:34.131
I'm her legal guardian.

12:38.884 --> 12:43.061
There's a train coming into
town from Union City tonight.

12:43.661 --> 12:46.082
I want you on it when it leaves.

12:46.431 --> 12:48.027
I don't need your money.

12:48.122 --> 12:49.686
I need my family.

12:56.871 --> 12:59.832
(ALLIE) Why does Uncle Nathan ate him?

13:00.050 --> 13:02.799
I am sure he doesn't hate
your grandfather, Allie.

13:02.824 --> 13:04.045
It's just...

13:04.070 --> 13:05.200
Complicated.

13:05.225 --> 13:07.345
That's all Uncle Nathan ever says.

13:07.691 --> 13:11.191
From the little you told me
about it, it is complicated.

13:11.524 --> 13:14.377
And I imagine your uncle and
grandfather have gone through

13:14.402 --> 13:15.596
a lot together over the years

13:15.623 --> 13:17.565
that you and I don't even know about.

13:17.820 --> 13:20.136
But he's my mom's dad too.

13:20.161 --> 13:23.464
So maybe she liked him even
if Uncle Nathan doesn't.

13:23.650 --> 13:25.317
It's certainly possible.

13:26.373 --> 13:30.184
Mrs. Thornton, he is my grandpa
and I haven't even met him.

13:30.421 --> 13:32.948
I should have the right to
talk to him if I want to.

13:33.190 --> 13:34.894
It's not fair.

13:35.217 --> 13:37.700
I know you must have a
thousand questions.

13:37.920 --> 13:41.323
But just ask your Uncle
Nathan, he will explain.

13:41.958 --> 13:43.687
Every time I try to talk about grandpa,

13:43.712 --> 13:45.623
he always changes the subject.

13:47.938 --> 13:50.156
You know what I do when I
have a lot of feelings,

13:50.486 --> 13:52.165
I write them down.

13:52.466 --> 13:54.004
Why don't you take out your diary

13:54.029 --> 13:56.680
and write down all of the things
you've been saying to me.

13:56.705 --> 13:59.992
And then I will see you later
tonight at the sleepover.

14:00.186 --> 14:02.199
Maybe I should just call it off.

14:02.459 --> 14:04.786
I think being around
your friends right now

14:04.811 --> 14:07.027
is exactly what you need.

14:07.431 --> 14:10.400

Just a beer today, thanks Lucas.

14:25.991 --> 14:27.004

14:27.029 --> 14:29.665
Gustav made the goulash
extra spicy today.

14:29.890 --> 14:31.464
Yeah, I'm sure.

14:31.972 --> 14:33.735
Is there something wrong
with your appetite?

14:33.760 --> 14:35.239
Nobody told you?

14:35.264 --> 14:36.527

14:37.120 --> 14:39.449
Ned Yost got sick eating lunch here.

15:08.529 --> 15:10.100
Word travels fast.

15:10.125 --> 15:12.579
I think it may have been the goulash.

15:12.604 --> 15:15.439
Alright, well, I had some
this morning and I'm fine

15:15.464 --> 15:17.021

Whatever do you mean?

15:42.153 --> 15:43.778
He's my grandpa.

15:45.038 --> 15:48.031
Doesn't automatically
make him a good person.

15:48.536 --> 15:50.710
But he seems nice.

15:51.978 --> 15:55.484
Just because he seems nice,
doesn't mean that he is.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.789
He hurt a lot of people.

15:57.856 --> 15:59.106
How?

16:00.429 --> 16:02.700
I'll tell you when you're older.

16:03.200 --> 16:04.699
Maybe he's changed.

16:04.724 --> 16:07.481
No. He hasn't.

what he's in for.

I heard that his father
is in town, is that true?

17:32.256 --> 17:34.292
You should tell Nathan that.

Maybe he could use some perspective

17:36.233 --> 17:38.928
and you certainly have plenty to share.

Okay, I am about to share with you

one of the most important
secrets to a happy marriage.

18:27.482 --> 18:29.687
Now let's say that Clara
comes to you and says

18:29.712 --> 18:31.282
the drain is clogged.

18:31.425 --> 18:33.308
- What do you do?
- Fix it.

18:33.333 --> 18:35.824
That's right. You fix
it, simple, no problem.

18:35.849 --> 18:38.615
Now, let's say you come
home and Clara is upset

18:38.640 --> 18:40.802
because she was in town
earlier and waved at a friend

18:40.827 --> 18:43.621
and that friend did not wave back.

18:43.646 --> 18:45.269
What do you do then?

18:45.294 --> 18:47.051
Uhhh... I tell her she
shouldn't be upset

18:47.076 --> 18:49.275
because her friend probably
just didn't see her.

18:49.300 --> 18:53.581
Oh, no! You say, I can certainly see

Not really, no.

actually fix something.

have survived without me.

Ahh.

I suppose you think
that he's a great guy.

You know, when I was Allie's age

23:01.240 --> 23:03.979
I remember finding my mother in tears

23:04.939 --> 23:07.304
because my father pawned a ruby brooch

23:07.329 --> 23:11.411
he got for her to pay
for a gambling debt.

23:12.464 --> 23:16.968
Instead of getting better,
it just got worse and worse

23:16.993 --> 23:18.676
until one day he was found

23:18.701 --> 23:21.059

bank that he worked at.

23:22.570 --> 23:24.388
That's how he ended up in prison.

That's how he ended up in
prison the first time.

23:26.847 --> 23:30.055
After he got out no bank
would hire him so he...

23:32.967 --> 23:36.408
He resorted to petty theft
just to put food on our table.

23:40.033 --> 23:42.469
How am I supposed to explain to
Allie that if she lets him in

23:42.494 --> 23:44.596
all he's going to do
is break her heart.

23:47.175 --> 23:51.437
Maybe just let her explain
how she's feeling.

What rumour?

24:22.386 --> 24:24.726
That Ned Yost got sick here
having breakfast yesterday.

24:24.751 --> 24:25.919
What?!

24:25.944 --> 24:27.732
It must have been the kippers?

24:27.757 --> 24:29.320
What must have been the kippers?

24:29.345 --> 24:31.187
Ned Yost ordered them for
breakfast yesterday.

- What?!
- <i>Well, hold on.</i>

24:34.889 --> 24:36.553

sick from eating them?

24:36.578 --> 24:38.157
Not so far as I know.

24:38.360 --> 24:41.699
But then, nobody but
Ned actually ate them.

Hello.

No, you kinda made your own bed, Bill.

It's not my fault that Ned Yost
is a gluten for smoked fish.

24:55.555 --> 24:58.050
No, no, Ned doesn't
have food poisoning.

24:58.075 --> 25:00.208
At least I'm virtually
certain he doesn't.

25:00.233 --> 25:02.299
All symptoms point to a gastric ulcer.

in with stomach pain?

- No.
- Well, that's a real possibility.

Of course, I'm having to examine
Ned to find out for sure.

33:38.919 --> 33:40.340
Hi.

33:41.565 --> 33:43.368
Listen, I, um...

33:46.011 --> 33:48.410
I wanted to come by and invite you

33:48.435 --> 33:53.203
to sit with Allie and me at the BBQ.

33:53.873 --> 33:55.443
Thank you, son.

33:55.971 --> 33:58.800
You won't be sorry. I swear it.

34:01.393 --> 34:04.220
Yeah, well you know, she just wants
to know more about Colleen so...

34:04.245 --> 34:07.414
Well, I have plenty to
say on that subject.

34:10.411 --> 34:11.953
I'll see ya there.

34:14.328 --> 34:15.813
Have you really quit?

34:15.838 --> 34:17.661
Because if I find out
that you're lying...

34:17.686 --> 34:19.078
Nathan.

34:21.502 --> 34:23.842
I am really trying this time.

34:24.501 --> 34:26.154
I swear it.

34:42.225 --> 34:44.735
Oh, there we go.

34:45.181 --> 34:48.416
You should have seen Allie
listing off all the reasons

34:48.440 --> 34:50.235
she wanted to get to know her grandpa.

34:50.692 --> 34:54.520
It's wonderful that they are
going to sit down together.

34:55.833 --> 34:58.507
I understand why Nathan has
reservations about Archie,

34:58.532 --> 35:02.195
I just... I want to believe
that people can change.

35:02.220 --> 35:03.686
Well, I absolutely believe that.

35:03.711 --> 35:05.737
Look at Jesse.

35:09.572 --> 35:10.966
Rosemary?

35:12.306 --> 35:14.160
Are you asking my opinion?

35:14.298 --> 35:17.519
Are you asking me if I'm asking you?

35:17.544 --> 35:18.804
What's gotten into you?

35:18.829 --> 35:21.103
Well, I just wanted to be sure.

35:21.128 --> 35:23.247
All right, here it is.

35:23.579 --> 35:25.748
I think it is all well
and good to give people

35:25.773 --> 35:26.968
the benefit of the doubt,

35:26.993 --> 35:30.108
but don't forget
Elizabeth as a Mountie,

35:30.133 --> 35:33.639
Nathan has been trained to be an
excellent judge of character.

35:35.875 --> 35:37.526
I never thought of it that way.

35:37.551 --> 35:38.664
Well...

35:38.689 --> 35:40.447
That's actually really good advice.

35:40.472 --> 35:42.154
Or course it is.

35:42.253 --> 35:44.705
So often wasted.

35:57.891 --> 35:59.499
You okay?

35:59.716 --> 36:02.197
I think Rosemary is upset with me.

36:02.817 --> 36:04.502
Tell me all about it, sweetheart.

36:04.527 --> 36:07.105
Well, I decided I want
to design my own dress

36:07.130 --> 36:08.631
for the wedding.

36:08.656 --> 36:09.724
[SIGHS]

36:09.749 --> 36:13.399
Just... I don't know how to tell her.

36:14.462 --> 36:16.612
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

36:18.155 --> 36:21.631
I can see it's certainly
making you anxious.

36:21.656 --> 36:23.830
Jesse, that isn't exactly helpful.

36:24.088 --> 36:25.391
You really want my help?

36:25.416 --> 36:26.482
Well, yes.

36:26.507 --> 36:27.526
Are you sure?

36:27.551 --> 36:29.384
What is going on?

36:29.409 --> 36:31.112
- I'm confused.
- So am I?

36:31.137 --> 36:32.336
How am I supposed to know

36:32.361 --> 36:35.011
when you want me to fix
something or you don't?

36:35.036 --> 36:37.238
How about just asking me?

36:43.971 --> 36:45.910
Who have you been talking to?

36:46.791 --> 36:47.932
Lee.

36:47.957 --> 36:50.033
Mmm, I see.

36:51.159 --> 36:53.269
But I'm not Rosemary.

36:53.294 --> 36:54.327
Right.

36:54.352 --> 36:55.709
Mmmhmm.

36:55.897 --> 36:59.497
You know, in that case,
just be honest with her.

36:59.522 --> 37:00.938
Tell her you appreciate her help

37:00.963 --> 37:03.971
but this is really important to you.

37:03.996 --> 37:05.626
She is going to understand.

37:06.749 --> 37:08.464
Thank you.

37:10.146 --> 37:12.942
That's exactly what I need to hear.

37:15.434 --> 37:17.276
Smoked paprika?

37:17.586 --> 37:20.541
On salad, never.

37:22.819 --> 37:25.952
Hi Allie, are you making another list?

37:26.088 --> 37:28.620
I'm writing all the things
I want to ask Grandpa.

37:28.645 --> 37:30.002
Oh.

37:31.979 --> 37:33.898
He's coming this way.

37:34.821 --> 37:36.326
Will you stay?

37:36.351 --> 37:37.725
Of course.

37:38.796 --> 37:40.103
Good afternoon, ladies.

37:40.128 --> 37:41.294
Hi.

37:41.319 --> 37:42.943
Would you care to join us?

37:42.968 --> 37:44.367
Thank you.

37:45.499 --> 37:47.427
- Hi.
- Hi.

37:47.966 --> 37:49.449
So do you like to write?

37:49.674 --> 37:51.056
Yeah.

37:51.081 --> 37:54.036
Your mother used to
spend hours writing.

37:54.061 --> 37:55.399
What did she write?

37:55.516 --> 37:58.834
Well, she made up a story
about two chipmunks

37:58.859 --> 38:01.658
who had forgotten where they
had hidden their chestnuts.

38:01.683 --> 38:03.173
So, then what happened?

38:03.198 --> 38:06.654
Well, they decided they
liked jelly beans instead.

38:21.067 --> 38:22.291
Thank you, Florence.

38:22.316 --> 38:23.716
I'll see you at the BBQ

38:23.741 --> 38:27.248
in which everything is
completely safe to eat.

38:30.948 --> 38:33.047
Yes, this is Constable Grant.

38:33.525 --> 38:35.635
Yes, Archibald Grant is my father.

38:35.660 --> 38:38.093
Why? What is this about?

38:44.374 --> 38:46.553
No. That is not what I said.

38:46.578 --> 38:48.010
Really?

38:48.035 --> 38:50.035
Tell me another story, Grandpa.

38:51.376 --> 38:55.271
Then there was this time where
she got it into her head

38:55.296 --> 38:56.523
that she could fly.

38:56.548 --> 39:00.498
All she needed was a sheet and a
roof for a jumping-off point.

39:00.523 --> 39:02.120
How old was she?

39:02.145 --> 39:04.186
Oh! About five.

39:04.697 --> 39:06.893
I found her just in time to catch her

39:06.918 --> 39:08.450
before she took off.

39:08.475 --> 39:10.338
It's a lucky thing you were there.

39:10.511 --> 39:14.606
I always knew what was going
on in that noggin of hers.

39:15.071 --> 39:18.026
I wish your grandma was
here to jog my memory.

39:18.953 --> 39:20.486
I'm not supposed to say.

39:20.511 --> 39:22.969
Oh, don't even think
about it, sweetheart.

39:22.994 --> 39:25.426
I wasn't asking.

39:29.123 --> 39:31.055
Would you like some lemonade?

39:31.244 --> 39:34.077
You're very kind, just
like your mother.

39:34.102 --> 39:35.531
- Yes, I would.
- Okay.

39:35.556 --> 39:37.441
I'll come and help.

39:40.234 --> 39:41.560
Rosemary?

39:41.585 --> 39:44.595
Clara, I've been thinking

39:45.432 --> 39:47.874
I can see your point about
an outdoor wedding.

39:47.899 --> 39:50.777
I think it could be very
charming, beautiful even.

39:50.890 --> 39:53.525
Were you imagining a
reception like this?

39:53.687 --> 39:55.103
Maybe.

39:55.128 --> 39:56.409
There is so much to think about.

39:56.434 --> 39:58.933
Oh, Clara, you have no idea.

40:01.012 --> 40:02.426
But don't you worry,

40:02.451 --> 40:05.645
I'm sure you'll make all
the right decisions.

40:07.347 --> 40:10.482
Rosemary... about my dress.

40:10.507 --> 40:13.140
Oh, I can't wait to hear
what we're going to do

40:13.165 --> 40:15.847
Are we doing traditional or modern?

40:16.427 --> 40:18.751
My decision is that

40:19.590 --> 40:22.420
I'd like to try designing it myself.

40:22.451 --> 40:25.952
Oh, I see.

40:25.977 --> 40:28.468
Not that you wouldn't
do a wonderful job.

40:28.805 --> 40:33.430
Clara, no explanation needed.

40:33.455 --> 40:36.460
It's your wedding, your rules.

40:36.773 --> 40:38.880
If you need my help with anything else,

40:38.905 --> 40:41.653
all you have to do is ask, really.

40:42.840 --> 40:45.317
Well, I do have one request.

40:45.940 --> 40:47.983
Let me guess, you want me
to look after the music?

40:48.008 --> 40:50.351
Oh, or the menu? The flowers?

40:50.376 --> 40:52.117
[LAUGHS] It's bigger than that.

Bigger than the flowers?

Will you be my matron of honour.

40:58.008 --> 41:00.479
I can't do this without you.

- Absolutely.
