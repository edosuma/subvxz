{\an8}(Kelsey)
A dark cloud had formed

00:05.422 --> 00:07.674
{\an8}over our sunny island
of Siesta Key.

00:07.757 --> 00:09.801
{\an1}You say you're
so different than Alex,

00:09.884 --> 00:11.094
but you're just as bad.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.471
{\an1}I don't owe anyone
my loyalty.

00:13.555 --> 00:15.682
Nothing goes down
good on that boat.

00:15.765 --> 00:17.976
{\an5}(Kelsey)
And with Alex
still lurking around,

00:18.059 --> 00:20.145
things just kept getting
shadier.

00:21.646 --> 00:23.022
Get off me!
(bleep).

00:23.106 --> 00:24.107
(Kelsey)
Most of us hoped

00:24.190 --> 00:25.150
he'd be too busy in law school

00:25.233 --> 00:26.234
to cause problems.

00:26.317 --> 00:27.485
I'm really proud of you.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.195
{\an5}(Kelsey)
But something
kept pulling him

00:29.279 --> 00:30.363
back to Siesta Key.

00:30.447 --> 00:31.781
I do miss you.

00:31.865 --> 00:34.617
{\an5}(Kelsey)
We didn't know it then,
but Juliette

00:34.701 --> 00:36.411
was a two-timing cheat.

00:36.494 --> 00:37.287
But the messier they got...

00:37.370 --> 00:40.290
Seeing you with
Garrett, it sucked.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.125
I would like to be
with you.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.126
{\an5}(Kelsey)
...the more we all
started to catch on...

00:43.209 --> 00:46.588
Alex went up to visit
Juliette at school

00:46.671 --> 00:48.465
and they were
all over each other.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.675
{\an5}(Kelsey)
...and the closer Juliette got
to getting what she deserved.

00:50.759 --> 00:52.135
I'm just (bleep) over it.

00:52.218 --> 00:55.388
{\an5}(Kelsey)
But Juliette wasn't
the only one

00:55.472 --> 00:56.556
playing with fire.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.391
{\an5}This is Canvas.

00:56.639 --> 00:58.391
Canvas?

00:58.475 --> 00:59.809
Fresh in town, you got
a boyfriend, anything?

00:59.893 --> 01:00.602
{\an3}All alone.

01:00.685 --> 01:03.146
{\an1}Canvas is gonna
get me in trouble.

01:03.229 --> 01:06.524
{\an5}(Kelsey)
At least Madisson
finally stood up for herself.

01:06.608 --> 01:08.610
I don't want to have
this conversation again,

01:08.693 --> 01:09.861
so step off.

01:09.944 --> 01:11.863
(Kelsey)
We assumed the coast was clear,

01:11.946 --> 01:15.825
so Madisson and I headed off to
New York to pursue our dreams.

01:15.909 --> 01:17.911
I got a phone call
from agencies in New York.

01:17.994 --> 01:20.663
I'm so excited.

01:17.994 --> 01:20.663

01:20.747 --> 01:21.372
(Kelsey)
Little did we know

01:21.456 --> 01:23.708
that trip would change my life

02:44.622 --> 02:45.540
What do you think of it?

02:45.623 --> 02:46.583
Oh, my God, Kels,

02:46.666 --> 02:48.877
you look, like,
so high fashion.

02:48.960 --> 02:51.588
{\an1}It doesn't look like
the Siesta Key Kelsey, does it?

02:51.671 --> 02:54.340
No. You look like
a vampire in this one.

02:54.424 --> 02:55.758
{\an1}I do.

02:55.842 --> 02:57.010
It's beautiful, though.

02:57.093 --> 02:59.929
{\an1}Thanks, yeah. Like, that's,
like, the editorial side of it.

03:00.013 --> 03:01.264
{\an1}There's editorial
and commercial.

03:01.347 --> 03:02.515
{\an1}Commercial's more,
like, the cheap side.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.976
Like, catalogue,
not as glamorous.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.561
{\an6}Okay.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.561
{\an1}And I always
did editorial,

03:06.644 --> 03:08.980
{\an1}and that's the runway and
high fashion and all of that.

03:09.063 --> 03:11.399
{\an1}Like, "Vogue,"
"Elle," and, like,

03:11.482 --> 03:12.650
the more prestigious
side of the industry.

03:12.734 --> 03:13.735
Okay. All these
all editorial?

03:13.818 --> 03:15.028
{\an1}Yeah, 'cause
that's what I did,

03:15.111 --> 03:16.446
{\an1}so I'm hoping that
I can get into that.

03:16.529 --> 03:18.072
Are you excited?
Are you nervous?

03:18.156 --> 03:19.115
{\an5}How are you feeling?

03:18.156 --> 03:19.115
{\an1}I'm excited
and I'm nervous,

03:19.198 --> 03:21.284
{\an1}'cause, like,
I have a meeting set up

03:21.367 --> 03:22.869
{\an1}with One Management
and Wilhelmina.

03:22.952 --> 03:23.870
Plus, I'm meeting
with a designer,

03:23.953 --> 03:27.624
{\an1}so my goal is to meet
with these two agencies

03:27.707 --> 03:30.168
{\an1}and then hopefully at least one
of them will want to sign me.

03:30.251 --> 03:32.045
I'm kinda worried about that.

03:32.128 --> 03:35.131
{\an1}This is actually a big deal.
I'm really scared, like...

03:35.214 --> 03:37.175
{\an1}All my friends are
graduating from college now

03:37.258 --> 03:40.345
{\an1}and I left school to model,
and if it doesn't work,

03:40.428 --> 03:43.765
like, I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

03:43.848 --> 03:45.224
{\an1}I don't wanna
bartend here forever.

03:45.308 --> 03:49.395
{\an5}You're 20, Kels.

03:45.308 --> 03:49.395
Yeah, but a model's span of,

03:49.479 --> 03:51.648
{\an1}like, actually working
is very short.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.567
Oh, my gosh.

03:54.651 --> 03:55.944
So it's, like,
now or never.

03:56.027 --> 03:57.320
So there is
a lot riding on it.

03:57.403 --> 03:59.948
{\an1}Yeah, for both of us.
It's huge.

04:00.031 --> 04:02.825
I was able to set up
one meeting

04:02.909 --> 04:04.494
at an engineering firm.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.914
{\an1}No way.
Is Brandon happy for you?

04:07.997 --> 04:09.874
Yeah, he's being really
supportive, like,

04:09.958 --> 04:12.168
and I know I'm missing
his performance.

04:12.251 --> 04:13.294
{\an4}I know.

04:12.251 --> 04:13.294
But this is a good
opportunity for me too

04:13.378 --> 04:16.005
{\an5}and he totally
sees it that way.

04:13.378 --> 04:16.005
{\an1}Good.

04:16.089 --> 04:17.464
{\an1}Well, I'm glad
you guys are doing good.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.676
Like, we had our--
our hiccups,

04:19.759 --> 04:22.887
{\an1}but I feel like we're in a
really good place right now.

04:22.971 --> 04:25.390
{\an1}So excited.
That's awesome.

04:25.473 --> 04:27.308
Bro, you know who
texted me the other day?

04:27.392 --> 04:28.851
{\an3}Canvas.

04:28.935 --> 04:31.187
{\an1}Really?

04:28.935 --> 04:31.187
{\an3}Yeah.

04:31.270 --> 04:32.689
She hit me up,
talking about, like,

04:32.772 --> 04:35.692
if I could help her,
like, sit down

04:35.775 --> 04:38.194
with her music, and, like,
what she has written.

04:38.277 --> 04:41.364
{\an1}Yeah, I don't know,
man, she's--

04:41.447 --> 04:43.241
{\an1}She's kind of
a troublemaker to me, like...

04:43.324 --> 04:45.702
{\an6}I got you.

04:43.324 --> 04:45.702
As long as you don't get,

04:45.785 --> 04:47.537
like, lost in, like, the...

04:47.620 --> 04:48.705
{\an3}The sauce?

04:47.620 --> 04:48.705
{\an1}Yeah.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.456
{\an3}Nah.

04:48.788 --> 04:50.456
You got a good girl, man.

04:50.540 --> 04:52.083
That's what I want, bro.

04:52.166 --> 04:52.709
{\an3}Yeah!

04:52.792 --> 04:55.878
{\an8}♪♪

04:55.962 --> 05:00.717

04:55.962 --> 05:00.717

05:00.800 --> 05:02.552
{\an9}Zichwan?

05:02.635 --> 05:04.595
{\an8}Fried shrimp?

05:04.679 --> 05:06.055
This weekend was crazy.

05:06.139 --> 05:07.724
{\an1}Did you know
Alex was gonna come?

05:07.807 --> 05:10.685
I had no idea,
but not gonna say

05:10.768 --> 05:12.645
that I wasn't happy
when he did show up.

05:12.729 --> 05:16.315
Like, he has been wrong
to me, but he basically,

05:16.399 --> 05:19.193
like, came straight out
and said he wants to,

05:19.277 --> 05:23.823
like, get back to how
things used to be and...

05:23.906 --> 05:25.825
You don't like that,
do you?

05:28.536 --> 05:31.789
{\an1}You know that his words
are very convincing,

05:31.873 --> 05:32.999
{\an1}just like
they always have been,

05:33.082 --> 05:34.792
{\an1}but you don't
even want to start that.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.836
{\an1}Honestly, like, you deserve
so much better than Alex.

05:36.919 --> 05:38.588
{\an1}Like, he's gonna be
one of the guys

05:38.671 --> 05:41.174
{\an4}that doesn't grow up
'til they're 40.

05:38.671 --> 05:41.174
{\an3}Yeah.

05:41.257 --> 05:44.052
{\an1}And I've learned that
the most important thing

05:44.135 --> 05:47.096
{\an1}to keep a relationship
going and strong is trust,

05:47.180 --> 05:48.931
and once trust is broken,

05:49.015 --> 05:50.433
{\an1}it's almost
impossible to regain.

05:50.516 --> 05:55.730
{\an6}Yeah.

05:50.516 --> 05:55.730
Plus, you already
have a nice guy.

05:55.813 --> 05:59.400
{\an1}Garrett is a really good guy,
but I'm not gonna, like,

05:59.484 --> 06:02.570
put all my marbles
in one basket.

06:02.653 --> 06:06.074

07:07.718 --> 07:09.303
Hi, Kelsey, Anthony.
Thank you

07:09.387 --> 07:10.847
for getting on that
plane and coming here.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.223
{\an5}Oh, of course.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.223
How's your day going?

07:12.306 --> 07:15.351
{\an9}It's good.

07:12.306 --> 07:15.351
{\an8}So you want the second act.

07:15.434 --> 07:18.020
{\an7}Yes, I do.

07:15.434 --> 07:18.020
{\an8}When you were doing this

07:18.104 --> 07:20.189
{\an8}the first time,
why'd you leave?

07:20.273 --> 07:22.233
I was really young
and loved it,

07:22.316 --> 07:23.526
but worked in, like,
London, Milan, Paris.

07:23.609 --> 07:26.904
{\an5}Your other markets.

07:23.609 --> 07:26.904
Yeah, and I even did Tokyo.

07:26.988 --> 07:28.865
Like, I've loved seeing
different cultures

07:28.948 --> 07:29.991
{\an5}and all of that as well.

07:28.948 --> 07:29.991
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

07:30.074 --> 07:31.534
But also,
I was a 16-year-old.

07:31.617 --> 07:32.869
Like, I didn't know
what I was doing.

07:32.952 --> 07:35.997
And then my mom had been
diagnosed with M.S.,

07:36.080 --> 07:37.373
{\an1}so, like, I was
dealing with all of that.

07:37.456 --> 07:39.542
Yeah, of course.
Since the time you've left,

07:39.625 --> 07:40.960
a lot has--
a lot has changed.

07:41.043 --> 07:42.545
Yeah, I do understand that.

07:42.628 --> 07:44.088
{\an1}I'm looking at you
and I'm, like, sitting

07:44.172 --> 07:46.841
and thinking, like, where
does she fit in, you know?

07:46.924 --> 07:48.968
{\an8}I'm hoping to get back into

07:49.051 --> 07:50.553
the editorial side
of modeling and, like,

07:50.636 --> 07:53.055
{\an5}runway and high fashion.

07:50.636 --> 07:53.055
(laughs)

07:54.724 --> 07:55.725
(laughs)

07:56.976 --> 07:58.394
Um, maybe I'm gonna be

07:58.477 --> 08:00.188
politically incorrect here.

08:00.271 --> 08:03.065
Uh, I never say to any girl,

08:03.149 --> 08:05.985
like, you need to lose weight,

08:06.068 --> 08:07.653
{\an1}but the pressure
to be a certain shape

08:07.737 --> 08:10.990
{\an1}in this industry,
it's real. You know,

08:11.073 --> 08:11.782
I think let's look
at your book.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.743
I don't know
how updated it is.

08:13.826 --> 08:15.620
It's not-- So there's,
like, old ones

08:15.703 --> 08:17.580
and updated ones,
but, like, you can

08:17.663 --> 08:19.207
look through
and get an idea.

08:20.583 --> 08:23.628
Um... Yeah.

08:27.256 --> 08:31.510
Well, most of these images
are very old.

08:31.594 --> 08:35.097
{\an5}They don't, to me,
reflect who you are.

08:31.594 --> 08:35.097
{\an1}Right.

08:35.181 --> 08:39.393
{\an1}Um, I think we probably need
to change this book completely.

08:39.477 --> 08:41.895
Right. You're at
a disadvantage coming back

08:41.979 --> 08:42.647
into the business
as opposed to somebody

08:42.730 --> 08:44.774
who was never
in the business.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.192
Trends change.

08:46.275 --> 08:48.277
Your look might have been
very key then.

08:48.361 --> 08:50.488
It might not necessarily be now,
and you know,

08:50.571 --> 08:53.157
this market is the toughest
market out of any market.

08:53.241 --> 08:55.034
Nobody cares that
you have a personality,

08:55.117 --> 08:57.161
nobody cares that you're fun.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.622
I'm doing this longer
than you're on this planet.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.500
When I look at your body,
when I look at your face,

09:02.583 --> 09:05.711
when I look at just the overall
package, I don't know.

09:05.795 --> 09:09.423
I don't see you
doing high fashion.

09:09.507 --> 09:13.719
{\an5}You're not built like that
typical editorial girl.

09:09.507 --> 09:13.719
{\an1}Right.

09:13.803 --> 09:17.598

{\an1}What's up?

10:19.785 --> 10:23.289
So, I see Alex
came and visited you.

10:23.372 --> 10:24.832
The kid that I've already
had many problems with,

10:24.915 --> 10:27.793
{\an1}the kid that I don't trust,
who's already caused

10:27.877 --> 10:28.919
so many other problems
with me.

10:29.003 --> 10:30.463
Can I explain for a second?

10:30.546 --> 10:32.089
{\an3}Not really.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.089
{\an1}I--

10:32.173 --> 10:34.383
There's nothing else
to explain.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.885
To see him, like,
around you, like,

10:35.968 --> 10:37.553
I don't want
any part of that.

10:37.636 --> 10:40.056
{\an1}I think that you're
not over what happened

10:40.139 --> 10:41.557
between Alex and Kelsey,

10:41.640 --> 10:43.351
{\an1}and I think that you
and I really don't work.

10:43.434 --> 10:45.269
I mean, I'm not over
anything with Alex.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.730
{\an5}Do you think we work?

10:45.353 --> 10:47.730
No, we obviously
don't work.

10:47.813 --> 10:49.482
{\an1}I mean, honestly, I think
you're better off with Alex.

10:49.565 --> 10:51.400
{\an1}Yeah, that's all this
really is about.

10:51.484 --> 10:53.402
This has nothing
to do with him.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.196
It has a lot to do
with him, actually.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.031
{\an4}I know that you're
prone to think that.

10:55.279 --> 10:57.031
I mean, he comes into it.

10:57.114 --> 10:59.325
{\an1}I know that you're going
to jump to that

10:59.408 --> 11:00.242
{\an1}because of what happened
in the past.

11:00.326 --> 11:02.161
I mean, it kind of
shows that what happened

11:02.244 --> 11:04.914
was that you came to me,
you know, to pretty much,

11:04.997 --> 11:06.248
like, get back at Alex,

11:06.332 --> 11:07.375
'cause, I mean,
that's kinda obvious.

11:07.458 --> 11:08.751
{\an1}Well, I could go around
and say

11:08.834 --> 11:10.503
{\an1}the same thing about Kelsey.
That's not true.

11:10.586 --> 11:11.921
Something's true
with you and Alex,

11:12.004 --> 11:12.922
not me and Kelsey,
you know what I mean?

11:13.005 --> 11:15.091
Like, I didn't put myself
in that situation.

11:15.174 --> 11:16.592
Look, I've known Alex
for a really long time

11:16.675 --> 11:18.886
{\an1}and we've been on and
off for a really long time,

11:18.969 --> 11:20.137
{\an1}and we're just friends
right now,

11:20.221 --> 11:21.180
{\an1}but he's always
going to be my friend.

11:21.263 --> 11:22.014
No, you're not just friends,

11:22.098 --> 11:24.141
'cause Alex isn't
just friends.

11:24.225 --> 11:26.352
I'm not gonna believe
that (bleep). Like...

11:26.435 --> 11:28.771
{\an1}You can make this
about him if you want,

11:28.854 --> 11:31.899
{\an1}but I'm here, trying
to be mature about this,

11:31.982 --> 11:33.109
and I just...

11:33.192 --> 11:34.443
I'm gonna stop you
right there.

11:34.527 --> 11:35.694
If he's in your life,

11:35.778 --> 11:37.988
I'm not gonna be

11:38.072 --> 11:39.323

I'm happy to get

12:34.670 --> 12:36.630
So this is my résumé.

12:38.549 --> 12:42.219
{\an5}So I see you have recently
graduated from school.

12:38.549 --> 12:42.219
{\an1}Yes.

12:42.303 --> 12:44.096
{\an8}Can you talk just
a little bit more about

12:44.180 --> 12:46.474
{\an8}your experience
since then or in school?

12:46.557 --> 12:49.018
{\an1}Since then, I've been
living in Florida

12:49.101 --> 12:51.270
{\an1}and trying to get
an engineering job,

12:51.353 --> 12:53.772
{\an1}but I don't have the
experience that, you know,

12:53.856 --> 12:57.026
others do when they
come out of school.

12:57.109 --> 12:59.987
{\an1}Like, I haven't done summer
internships or anything.

13:02.781 --> 13:05.826
{\an5}What did you do
instead of--

13:02.781 --> 13:05.826
{\an1}I traveled
most of my summers

13:05.910 --> 13:09.997
{\an1}and I did take some time off
from school to-- to go travel.

13:12.833 --> 13:14.293
{\an3}Um...

13:14.376 --> 13:16.754
But it's not--

13:14.376 --> 13:16.754
{\an3}Everyone--

13:16.837 --> 13:19.340
If you go to college,
you can get a degree.

13:19.423 --> 13:21.550
The extracurriculars
makes you different.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.512
Like, I was able to
graduate with good grades,

13:24.595 --> 13:28.516
but also, I showed how
I can work with people.

13:28.599 --> 13:29.934
{\an1}I didn't do
anything like that.

13:30.017 --> 13:30.935
At bigger companies,
they just have

13:31.018 --> 13:33.771
so many different teams,
you have to figure out

13:33.854 --> 13:36.398
{\an1}how to communicate.
It's a lot more fast-paced.

13:36.482 --> 13:38.150
Sometimes you're gonna be
working longer hours.

13:38.234 --> 13:39.026
{\an1}That's definitely something
that we would want

13:39.109 --> 13:43.280
{\an5}in someone who would
work here.

13:39.109 --> 13:43.280
{\an1}Yeah.

13:43.364 --> 13:44.740
{\an1}Um...

14:20.693 --> 14:22.570

14:22.653 --> 14:24.822

14:24.905 --> 14:27.241

(laughs)

15:29.178 --> 15:31.347
So you had
some time off school,

15:31.430 --> 15:33.015
you could come work
on your boat.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.892
Yeah, I just like being here.

15:34.975 --> 15:38.937
Yeah. I've been thinking
a lot about, you know,

15:39.021 --> 15:41.315
what we talked about
in Tallahassee,

15:41.398 --> 15:44.234
and how you'd like to

15:44.318 --> 15:46.862
{\an4}Yeah.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.862
Your down time,
like right now.

15:46.945 --> 15:47.655
And I've talked
to Garrett and--

15:47.738 --> 15:48.739
So you did talk to him.

15:48.822 --> 15:52.618
Yeah, we talked.
So that's over.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.372
{\an1}Well, I mean,
that means a lot,

15:56.455 --> 15:58.374
{\an4}because I know that
probably wasn't easy.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.374
{\an3}Yeah.

15:58.457 --> 15:59.792

21:09.309 --> 21:15.023
Yeah? Like...

21:15.107 --> 21:17.693
{\an1}Music has been, like,
my outlet completely for it.

21:17.776 --> 21:21.113
{\an1}Share.

21:17.776 --> 21:21.113
{\an3}Um, well...

21:21.196 --> 21:24.157
I technically
grew up homeless.

21:24.241 --> 21:26.159
Like, I've lived
in hotel lobbies,

21:26.243 --> 21:29.079
I've lived in cars
and, like,

21:29.162 --> 21:31.623
I've been taking care of
myself since I was 16.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.292
You know,
you go through things

21:34.376 --> 21:35.752
and, like, there's days
where you don't eat,

21:35.836 --> 21:36.294
there's days
where you don't know

21:36.378 --> 21:37.379
what's gonna happen,

21:37.462 --> 21:43.677
but writing's
definitely my escape.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.013
I feel the same here.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.015
{\an4}Different backgrounds,
though.

21:46.096 --> 21:48.015
{\an3}Yeah.

21:48.098 --> 21:49.641
{\an1}'Cause, I mean,
I've lived a pretty, like,

21:49.725 --> 21:52.602
{\an1}easygoing, like,
pretty privileged life.

21:52.686 --> 21:54.604
{\an1}Like, I-- I still
see both my parents

21:54.688 --> 21:56.773
all the time, I mean, like...

21:56.857 --> 21:58.150
{\an5}Nothing, like, too crazy.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.150
{\an3}Yeah.

21:58.233 --> 21:59.192
{\an1}But, like, for you,
it seems a little different.

21:59.276 --> 22:01.778
Like, I had to
grow up super fast

22:01.862 --> 22:03.947
and I emotionally
took care of myself.

22:06.575 --> 22:09.286
{\an1}So when stuff like that
would happen to you

22:09.369 --> 22:13.331
{\an1}and you'd just be by yourself,
you would go right here?

22:13.415 --> 22:16.043
Exactly. Just write.

22:16.126 --> 22:19.171
{\an1}Just from where I'm at,
as an artist,

22:19.254 --> 22:21.089
get behind a mic.
Know what you are.

22:21.173 --> 22:23.550
{\an1}If you're a writer,
that's fine,

22:23.633 --> 22:24.926
{\an5}but, like, just get--

22:23.633 --> 22:24.926

22:25.010 --> 22:26.678

22:26.762 --> 22:27.846

22:29.222 --> 22:33.351

that I could bring you to,

22:33.435 --> 22:35.604
which would be really fun,
is I have a show coming up.

22:35.687 --> 22:36.438
{\an4}I'll show you
how I go on stage.

22:35.687 --> 22:36.438
{\an3}Okay.

22:36.521 --> 22:38.732
{\an1}See me--
You see me here right now,

22:38.815 --> 22:40.567
I'm very calm and collect,

22:40.650 --> 22:42.360
{\an1}but on stage,
I might jump in the crowd,

22:42.444 --> 22:45.530
{\an1}I might take my shirt off.
And, like,

22:45.614 --> 22:47.282
Chloe will be there,
Pauly will be there.

22:47.365 --> 22:49.451
The only person that won't be
there is Madisson and Kelsey.

22:49.534 --> 22:53.246
Why not? That seems
a little, like...

22:53.330 --> 22:56.792
{\an1}Madisson got, like,
a job interview in New York.

22:56.875 --> 22:58.460
I just thought
she would, you know,

22:58.543 --> 23:00.295
{\an5}be there
for your performance.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.295
I thought she'd be there

23:00.378 --> 23:01.588
for my performance, but...

23:01.671 --> 23:02.255
I mean, like, I...

23:02.339 --> 23:04.966
If I was your girlfriend,

23:05.050 --> 23:06.009
I would try to be there.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.637
{\an1}Wow.

23:06.093 --> 23:08.637
{\an3}Yeah, so...

23:26.196 --> 23:28.323
{\an8}It's a model mixer.

23:28.406 --> 23:30.325
{\an8}What does that mean?
Like, who does that.

23:30.408 --> 23:32.994
{\an8}Friends of mine

24:02.190 --> 24:04.442
{\an8}We got here yesterday.

24:04.526 --> 24:05.902
{\an8}So I've been interviewing,
and then, so, like,

24:05.986 --> 24:06.862
{\an8}one is, like, one of
the agencies, I'm out,

24:06.945 --> 24:09.072
{\an8}and I'd kind of like
your guys' feedback.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.991
{\an7}I love One Switch. I've been
with them for two years.

24:11.074 --> 24:13.034
Are you doing
commercial or editorial?

24:13.118 --> 24:14.870
Commercial, like,
more, like, print stuff.

24:14.953 --> 24:16.037
{\an5}You like that?

24:14.953 --> 24:16.037
Yeah, I like it.

24:16.121 --> 24:16.830
I feel like
that's where you,

24:16.913 --> 24:17.747
{\an5}like, make the money.

24:16.913 --> 24:17.747
Yeah.

24:17.831 --> 24:19.875
{\an8}I was trying to get
back in editorial.

24:19.958 --> 24:21.668
{\an7}(Jason)
Yes, definitely.

24:21.751 --> 24:23.170
We're talking model talk.

24:23.253 --> 24:24.296
My favorite talk.

24:24.379 --> 24:25.505
It's mine, too.

24:25.589 --> 24:26.965
{\an8}I know so much about it.

24:27.048 --> 24:27.632
You're hanging about,
you know,

24:27.716 --> 24:29.759
a bunch of models, like...

24:29.843 --> 24:31.553
{\an1}I know, I feel
so insecure about myself

24:31.636 --> 24:33.763
{\an5}now that, like, I'm here.

24:31.636 --> 24:33.763
{\an3}No. Why?

24:33.847 --> 24:36.224
Why aren't you...

24:36.308 --> 24:37.392
{\an1}Oh, my God,
I could not be, like...

24:37.475 --> 24:41.855
{\an1}I'm-- I got a math
and engineering degree

24:41.938 --> 24:43.940
{\an1}and I've, like, never
thought about, like, modeling.

24:44.024 --> 24:45.984
I think you should
be doing this.

24:46.067 --> 24:48.904
Oh, my God, you're just
flattering me, though.

24:48.987 --> 24:50.572

24:51.823 --> 24:53.116
All right,
you have options.

24:53.200 --> 24:54.534
Let me tell you.

24:54.618 --> 24:57.037
You're lucky we're
here on a weekend.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.206
{\an4}We have a table

We'd love to have you.

No runway walks.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.465
No, all runway walks.

25:08.548 --> 25:10.592

the catwalk just for fun.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.980
{\an9}Yeah, yeah.

26:08.108 --> 26:11.987
{\an1}Um, these are very edgy,
and looking at you

26:12.070 --> 26:12.862
{\an1}and looking at these photos,
it's not--

26:12.946 --> 26:14.489

26:17.284 --> 26:18.785
{\an3}Yeah.

26:18.868 --> 26:22.205
{\an1}But I mean, it's a little
unrealistic for you right now

26:22.289 --> 26:24.749
to focus on runway
and high fashion.

26:24.833 --> 26:30.297
{\an4}That ship has kind of
already sailed for you.

26:24.833 --> 26:30.297
{\an3}Okay.

26:30.380 --> 26:32.590
{\an1}What could be more
exciting is focusing

26:32.674 --> 26:34.551
on a more commercial angle.

26:34.634 --> 26:36.678
I've always been, like,
editorial and high fashion

26:36.761 --> 26:38.638
is pretty much
what I've always been.

26:38.722 --> 26:41.182
Like, I worked in,
like, Tokyo.

26:41.266 --> 26:42.100
Like, I've loved all of
that, so like, I've never

26:42.183 --> 26:44.185
really done, like,
commercial stuff at all.

26:44.269 --> 26:44.853
Well, here's the thing.

26:44.936 --> 26:47.105
I think that you should start

26:47.188 --> 26:48.815
{\an1}thinking about
the commercial route,

26:48.898 --> 26:49.566
{\an1}not in the fact that,
you know,

26:49.649 --> 26:52.360
{\an1}it's, like,
below high fashion.

26:52.444 --> 26:56.072
{\an3}Yeah.

26:52.444 --> 26:56.072
But standardly pretty.

26:56.156 --> 26:57.699
You know, it's a lot
of swim, it's beauty,

26:57.782 --> 27:02.037
{\an1}it's bright, fun,
colorful shots. Um...

27:02.120 --> 27:02.871
It's more lifestyle,

27:02.954 --> 27:05.457
{\an1}but it's not in,
like, a cheesy way.

27:05.540 --> 27:07.834
It's just-- I think that, you
know, you're a gorgeous girl.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.544
You don't look like
your book anymore.

27:09.627 --> 27:12.630
{\an4}Um, but I think that there's
something there.

27:09.627 --> 27:12.630
{\an3}Okay.

27:12.714 --> 27:16.009
{\an1}And commercial girls
are ruling it right now.

27:17.927 --> 27:18.970
At the end of the day,

27:19.054 --> 27:20.221
modeling is
what I want to do.

27:20.305 --> 27:21.097
It's what
I'm passionate about,

27:21.181 --> 27:22.891
and that's where
I want to end up,

27:22.974 --> 27:24.351
so if commercial's
the way to go,

27:24.434 --> 27:25.226
then I would
absolutely be willing

27:25.310 --> 27:27.103
to do whatever it takes
for that.

27:27.187 --> 27:27.896
I like the sound of that,

27:27.979 --> 27:29.731
{\an1}but before we
make any decisions,

27:29.814 --> 27:34.069
{\an1}I would like you
to set up a test shoot

27:34.152 --> 27:35.570
{\an1}with someone
locally in Florida.

27:35.653 --> 27:36.654
{\an1}I want to see that
you're going to take

27:36.738 --> 27:39.616
{\an5}the initiative to do it.

27:36.738 --> 27:39.616
I can do that.

27:39.699 --> 27:41.368
I can't wait.

school and all that.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.422

27:52.087 --> 27:54.422
{\an1}Oh, baby.

27:54.506 --> 27:57.425
{\an1}It's nice

27:57.509 --> 27:59.094
{\an1}So what are your plans,
Juliette?

27:59.177 --> 28:03.056
{\an8}I don't know. I got back
together with Alex.

28:05.183 --> 28:07.602
What's going on
with Garrett?

28:07.685 --> 28:10.772
I don't feel like we're
supposed to be together.

28:10.855 --> 28:13.691
{\an1}Like, I just don't feel like
there's that connection.

28:13.775 --> 28:16.611
{\an7}Garrett seems like
he's picture perfect

28:16.694 --> 28:18.696
{\an7}and he's the perfect person
and all this stuff.

28:18.780 --> 28:21.324
{\an6}Nice guy.

28:18.780 --> 28:21.324
{\an1}He looks perfect,
he doesn't do anything wrong.

28:21.408 --> 28:22.992
But, like, that is so boring.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.245
{\an1}With Alex, I feel
like I can just be myself.

28:25.328 --> 28:28.039
{\an1}Like, he's my friend,
and I feel like Garrett and I

28:28.123 --> 28:30.542
{\an1}just don't have those,
like, friendly qualities

28:30.625 --> 28:33.670
{\an1}and, like, he doesn't find
the same things I find funny,

28:33.753 --> 28:35.713
and like, that's like,
not how it's supposed--

28:35.797 --> 28:36.965
These are super cute.

28:37.048 --> 28:37.757
{\an1}That's not how this
is supposed to happen.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.968
Look how that is.

28:37.841 --> 28:39.968
{\an3}Well-- Yes.

28:40.051 --> 28:43.304
You need to also remember
how your relationship

28:43.388 --> 28:44.806
with Alex has been
in the past.

28:44.889 --> 28:45.807
There's a little
bit of commotion

28:45.890 --> 28:49.310
around the relationship.
I mean, you know,

28:49.394 --> 28:50.437
he's hurt you in the past.

28:50.520 --> 28:52.772
He's cheating on you
with other girls.

28:52.856 --> 28:56.359
Is that something that
you want to go back to?

28:56.443 --> 28:57.569
{\an1}No, obviously, that's not
something I want to go back to.

28:57.652 --> 28:59.863
{\an1}Like, I don't
want to go back to him

28:59.946 --> 29:03.283
{\an1}and him cheat on me again,
but...

29:03.366 --> 29:07.328
{\an1}I feel like he's
different lately and...

29:07.412 --> 29:09.706
Well, I just want to,
one more time,

29:09.789 --> 29:11.791
be caution with Alex.

29:11.875 --> 29:12.750
He's hurt you in the past.

29:12.834 --> 29:16.546
I mean, you were not
very happy with him.

29:16.629 --> 29:18.590
{\an4}I know.

29:16.629 --> 29:18.590
I mean, it's not
a good foundation

29:18.673 --> 29:19.841
if there's jealousy
from day one.

29:19.924 --> 29:21.676
That doesn't work
for the long term.

29:21.759 --> 29:24.429
It's not right.
It's just not right.

29:24.512 --> 29:27.682
You need to be in
a healthy relationship.

29:27.765 --> 29:29.517
It's not a good thing
for you.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.187
Did you ever consider
maybe not being

29:32.270 --> 29:34.814
with anybody
for a little while?

29:34.898 --> 29:38.902
Be on your own and
learn to know yourself

29:38.985 --> 29:40.403
and be strong and go
through school and...

29:40.487 --> 29:44.324
