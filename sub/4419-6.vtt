00:37.171 --> 00:39.738
WITH SOUTH PARK'S
FAVORITE HUNTERS JIMBO AND NED.

00:39.740 --> 00:42.641
I'M JIMBO KERN
AND THIS HERE IS NED.

00:42.643 --> 00:43.675
SAY HI, NED.

00:43.677 --> 00:44.610
HI, NED.

00:44.612 --> 00:46.211
NOW ISN'T
THAT GREAT?

00:46.213 --> 00:48.280
WE HAVE A TERRIFIC
SHOW FOR YOU TODAY.

00:48.282 --> 00:49.948
WE'RE GONNA
KILL SOME ELK

00:49.950 --> 00:51.483
AND WE'RE GONNA KILL
SOME MOUNTAIN GOATS.

00:51.485 --> 00:54.653
NOW THE NEW LAW PASSED
BY COLORADO LEGISLATURE

00:54.655 --> 00:58.557
WHICH NED AND I CALL
PUSSY LAW #4 STATES...

01:00.961 --> 01:02.728
OUR OLD LINE OF
"IT'S COMIN' RIGHT FOR US",

01:02.730 --> 01:04.263
"IT'S COMIN'
RIGHT FOR US!"

01:04.265 --> 01:05.197
NO LONGER WORKS.

01:05.199 --> 01:08.067
SO NOW WE ONLY
KILL ANIMALS TO...

01:08.335 --> 01:10.235
IF WE DON'T HUNT,
THEN THESE ANIMALS

01:10.237 --> 01:11.637
WILL GROW TOO BIG
IN NUMBERS

01:11.639 --> 01:12.704
AND THEY WON'T
HAVE NO FOOD.

01:12.706 --> 01:15.274
SO YOU SEE
WE HAVE TO KILL ANIMALS

01:15.276 --> 01:17.676
OR ELSE THEY'LL DIE.

01:21.082 --> 01:22.314
SO ROLL THE TAPE.

01:22.316 --> 01:24.550
( Jimbo )
HERE WE ARE UP
AT SCHAEFER'S CROSSING

01:24.552 --> 01:25.717
LOOKING FOR
SOME ANIMALS.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.152
Look Ned,
there's some deer.

01:27.154 --> 01:29.421
Quick Ned,
thin out their numbers.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.857
Thin out
their numbers.

01:34.695 --> 01:36.962
Good work Ned,
now they won't starve.

01:36.964 --> 01:38.931
THAT SURE WAS
A GREAT HUNTING TRIP.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.966
WE SAVED THOSE DEER
FROM EXTINCTION.

01:40.968 --> 01:42.801
WE'RE ENVIRONMENTALISTS.

01:42.803 --> 01:43.735
COMING UP NEXT,

01:43.737 --> 01:45.170
WE'RE GONNA
DROP SOME NAPALM

01:45.172 --> 01:47.139
ON AN UNSUSPECTING
FAMILY OF BEAVERS,

01:47.141 --> 01:49.141
AND ALSO TRY TO
THIN OUT THE NUMBERS

01:49.143 --> 01:51.710
OF SOME
ENDANGERED SPECIES.

01:55.883 --> 01:58.150
MR. GARRISON,
WHAT'S VIETNAM?

01:58.152 --> 01:59.184
WHAT'S VIETNAM?

01:59.186 --> 02:00.719
A QUESTION A
CHILD MIGHT ASK

02:00.721 --> 02:03.889
BUT NOT A
CHILDISH QUESTION.

02:03.891 --> 02:05.324
CHILDREN, FOR
THE NEXT FEW DAYS

02:05.326 --> 02:06.792
WE'LL BE LEARNING
ALL ABOUT VIETNAM.

02:06.794 --> 02:08.794
CHANCES ARE THAT SOMEBODY
IN YOUR OWN LIVES

02:08.796 --> 02:10.996
WAS AFFECTED BY
THIS INCREDIBLE WAR.

02:10.998 --> 02:12.397
THAT'S RIGHT
MR. GARRISON,

02:12.399 --> 02:14.199
THE VIETNAM WAR
WAS STICKY AND ICKY.

02:14.201 --> 02:17.102
MR. GARRISON, WERE
YOU IN VIETNAM?

02:20.541 --> 02:22.207
( male )
Come on Ned,
let's go!

02:22.209 --> 02:24.243
Jump out of
the chopper!

02:24.745 --> 02:27.146
( male )
Who's next to
take a shower?

02:27.148 --> 02:28.313
Me, I am!

02:28.315 --> 02:29.715
You just took one
last time, silly.

02:29.717 --> 02:32.618
Oh, where can I hide
this big<i> pipe</i>?

02:33.120 --> 02:34.319
NO, I WASN'T
IN VIETNAM.

02:34.321 --> 02:35.888
BUT SOMETIMES I LIKE
TO PRETEND I WAS.

02:35.890 --> 02:38.257
ANYWAY CHILDREN,
I'M GOING TO ASSIGN
YOU ALL A PAPER.

02:38.259 --> 02:40.492
I WANT YOU ALL TO FIND
SOMEBODY IN YOUR OWN LIFE

02:40.494 --> 02:43.795
WHO WAS IN VIETNAM
AND INTERVIEW THEM ABOUT IT.

02:43.797 --> 02:46.532
WHAT IF WE DON'T KNOW
ANYBODY WHO WAS IN VIETNAM?

02:46.534 --> 02:48.600
THEN YOU GET AN F,
FAIL THE THIRD GRADE

02:48.602 --> 02:49.668
AND HAVE TO
GET A JOB

02:49.670 --> 02:52.171
CLEANING SEPTIC TANKS
TO SUPPORT YOUR DRUG HABIT.

02:52.173 --> 02:53.005
OH.

02:53.007 --> 02:54.339
DUDE, MY UNCLE JIMBO
WAS IN VIETNAM.

02:54.341 --> 02:56.508
YEAH, HIM AND NED DO
THAT STUPID TV SHOW.

02:56.510 --> 02:59.878
AND NOW TIME FOR...

02:59.880 --> 03:02.614
ONE OF OUR LOYAL VIEWERS
FROM SOUTH PARK

03:02.616 --> 03:04.016
SENT US SOME
8 MILLIMETER FILM

03:04.018 --> 03:07.419
OF WHAT HE CLAIMS
TO BE THE MEXICAN STARING FROG

03:07.421 --> 03:09.087
OF SOUTHERN
SRI LANKA.

03:09.089 --> 03:09.922
NOW AS YOU ALL KNOW,

03:09.924 --> 03:11.823
THE MEXICAN STARING FROG
OF SOUTHERN SRI LANKA

03:11.825 --> 03:13.992
CAN SUPPOSEDLY KILL YOU
WITH ONE HARD GAZE.

03:13.994 --> 03:16.695
IF A PERSON EVEN SO MUCH
AS LOOKS INTO THE FROG'S EYES,

03:16.697 --> 03:19.131
THEY CAN BE PARALYZED
OR EVEN DIE.

03:19.133 --> 03:21.133
AND THIS FILM PROVES
THAT THAT FROG

03:21.135 --> 03:22.534
MAY VERY WELL EXIST.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.569
NOW WATCH
CAREFULLY.

03:23.571 --> 03:26.772
YOU'RE GONNA SEE
THE MEXICAN STARING FROG.

03:27.808 --> 03:29.741
THERE, THERE
DID YOU SEE IT?

03:29.743 --> 03:31.777
ROLL THAT BACK AGAIN.

03:31.779 --> 03:33.212
NOW FREEZE IT.

03:33.214 --> 03:34.746
WELL, I'D LIKE
TO KNOW WHAT

03:34.748 --> 03:36.715
ALL SKEPTICS
HAVE TO SAY NOW?

03:36.717 --> 03:38.083
WHAT DO YOU
THINK, NED?

03:38.085 --> 03:38.884
I'M SCARED.

SO YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN YOUR UNCLE JIMBO'S

03:57.705 --> 03:58.604
BIG TV SHOW, HUH?

03:58.606 --> 04:00.539
NO, WE HAVE TO DO A
STUPID REPORT ON VIETNAM.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.741
YOU AND NED ARE THE ONLY
GUYS WE KNOW WHO WERE THERE.

04:02.743 --> 04:04.610
OH YEAH,
WE SURE WERE.

04:04.612 --> 04:05.344
WAS IT FUN?

04:05.346 --> 04:07.412
CARTMAN, WHAT KIND OF
STUPID ASS QUESTION IS THAT?

04:07.414 --> 04:08.480
OF COURSE,
IT WAS FUN.

04:08.482 --> 04:09.881
WELL, SURE
VIETNAM WAS FUN.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.683
BUT NOT LIKE GOING
TO THE CIRCUS FUN

04:11.685 --> 04:13.485
OR FLY FISHING
IN MONTANA FUN.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.686
NO, VIETNAM
WAS MORE LIKE

04:14.688 --> 04:16.688
SHOVING SHARDS
OF BROKEN GLASS
UP YOUR ASS

04:16.690 --> 04:19.458
AND THEN SITTING IN A TUB

04:55.062 --> 04:57.663
YOU AND KERN ARE BEST
SUITED TO TAKE THEM OUT.

04:57.665 --> 04:58.864
ARE YOU UP

05:08.542 --> 05:11.777
WHY THE HELL NOT?
WE'RE AT WAR.

05:12.579 --> 05:14.880
HEY, THOSE THINGS ARE
BAD FOR YOUR THROAT.

05:14.882 --> 05:16.515
NO, THAT'S

05:16.517 --> 05:18.417
CHARLIE'S

05:18.419 --> 05:20.519
I SEE 'EM,

HOLY SMOKES,
WE COULD GET AN EMMY.

06:25.386 --> 06:26.685
WE'VE GOT TO

06:26.687 --> 06:27.986
YOUR RATING ARE

06:29.356 --> 06:30.589
BUT I DON'T REALLY
CARE ABOUT THAT.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.357
WELL, YOU BETTER CARE,
MR. SMARTY PANTS.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.825

07:33.587 --> 07:36.455
NOTHING, NOTHING

07:37.958 --> 07:40.826
♪ NOTHING FROM NOTHING
LEAVES NOTHING ♪

07:40.828 --> 07:43.261

07:43.263 --> 07:44.362
OH, BOY.

07:44.364 --> 07:47.232
AND AFTER KILLING
THE ENTIRE VIETCONG ARMY,

07:47.234 --> 07:48.400
THEY RETURNED
TO BASE CAMP.

07:48.402 --> 07:50.702
ONCE THERE THEY RODE
THE DEVIL'S DROP ROLLER COASTER

07:50.704 --> 07:52.437
AND ATE COTTON CANDY
AND ULTIMATELY,

07:52.439 --> 07:55.273
NED GOT THE PURPLE HEART
FOR HIS COURAGEOUS DEFENSE

07:55.275 --> 07:56.274
OF THE LOG RIDE.

07:56.276 --> 07:58.243
SO WAS THE HORROR
OF VIETNAM.

07:58.245 --> 07:59.611
THE END.

07:59.613 --> 08:00.645
THE END.
THE END. THE END.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.848
ARE THERE
ANY QUESTIONS?

08:02.850 --> 08:03.915
YES, MR. GARRISON.

08:03.917 --> 08:04.950
YES, WHERE
THE!@#$%

08:04.952 --> 08:07.586
DID YOU HEAR
THIS RIDICULOUS
LOAD OF!@#$%?!

08:07.588 --> 08:09.554
FROM VIETNAM VETERANS.

08:09.556 --> 08:11.056
WELL BOYS, IT'S
OBVIOUS TO ME

08:11.058 --> 08:12.257
THAT YOU DIDN'T
DO YOUR WORK

08:12.259 --> 08:14.292
AND THAT YOU STAYED UP
ALL NIGHT MAKING UP

08:14.294 --> 08:15.560
SOME RIDICULOUS LIE.

08:15.562 --> 08:16.495
NO, NO,
WE DIDN'T.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.196
YOU ALL RECEIVE
AN F MINUS.

08:18.198 --> 08:19.498
F MINUS?
CAN HE DO THAT?

08:19.500 --> 08:20.699
BUT WE'RE NOT
MAKING IT UP.

08:20.701 --> 08:22.434
STANLEY,
THE VIETNAM
WAR WAS WAR.

08:22.436 --> 08:23.902
THERE WEREN'T
GALLOPING STEEDS

08:23.904 --> 08:25.370
OR SINGING BIRDS
OR LOG RIDES.

08:25.372 --> 08:27.305
HOW DO YOU KNOW,
YOU WEREN'T EVEN THERE.

08:27.307 --> 08:28.206
WELL, THAT'S IT!

08:28.208 --> 08:31.409
ALL OF YOU HAVE DETENTION
FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK!

08:35.482 --> 08:38.517
WELCOME TO
DETENTION, OKAY.

08:38.519 --> 08:40.952
MR. GARRISON TOLD ME
ABOUT YOUR LITTLE JOKE.

08:40.954 --> 08:42.921
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR
YOU ALL TO KNOW WHY

08:42.923 --> 08:43.855
YOU'RE IN DETENTION

08:43.857 --> 08:46.091
FOR YOU TO OBTAIN
THE FULL BENEFITS FROM IT.

08:46.093 --> 08:47.559
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE
YOU'RE INFERIOR,

08:47.561 --> 08:50.028
YOU'RE HERE BECAUSE
YOU'RE AWKWARD, OKAY?

08:50.030 --> 08:52.697
WELL STAN, THANKS A LOT FOR
HAVING SUCH A COOL UNCLE

08:52.699 --> 08:54.466
THAT GOT US ALL
DETENTION FOR A WEEK.

08:54.468 --> 08:56.601
YEAH DUDE, YOUR
UNCLE JIMBO SUCKS ASS.

08:56.603 --> 08:57.802
SHHH, OKAY.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.037
WHY WOULD HE JUST
INVENT A STORY

08:59.039 --> 09:00.572
INSTEAD OF TELLING
US THE TRUTH?

09:00.574 --> 09:03.542
MAYBE 'CAUSE
HE'S AN OLD DRUNK
HILLBILLY DICK.

09:03.544 --> 09:04.709
SHHH, OKAY.

09:04.711 --> 09:06.077
WE GOT TO GET
HIM BACK, DUDE.

09:06.079 --> 09:06.845
TOTALLY.

09:06.847 --> 09:07.479
HOW?

09:07.481 --> 09:08.647
WELL, HE SCREWED US
BY MAKING SOMETHING UP.

09:08.649 --> 09:09.681
I SAY WE DO
THE SAME THING.

09:09.683 --> 09:10.582
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:10.584 --> 09:12.450
DID YOU GUYS EVER SEE
THAT ONE "BRADY BUNCH"

09:12.452 --> 09:14.052
WHERE THE GUY...

09:14.054 --> 09:16.421
( whispering )

09:21.795 --> 09:23.161
AND NOW BACK TO...

09:23.163 --> 09:25.063
WITH SOUTH PARK'S
FAVORITE HUNTERS,

09:25.065 --> 09:26.398
JIMBO AND NED.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.299
WELCOME, HUNTERS.

09:27.301 --> 09:29.000
BOY, HAVE WE GOT
A SHOW FOR YOU TODAY.

09:29.002 --> 09:31.536
WE HAVE JUST RECEIVED
A TAPE FROM ANOTHER VIEWER

09:31.538 --> 09:33.004
WHO FILMED THE MEXICAN
STARING FROG

09:33.006 --> 09:35.707
OF SOUTHERN SRI LANKA
RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH PARK.

09:35.709 --> 09:37.609
YES, NOW WE'RE
ABOUT TO ROLL THE FILM,

09:37.611 --> 09:41.079
BUT REMEMBER, IF YOU LOOK
THE MEXICAN STARING FROG

09:41.081 --> 09:43.448
IN THE EYES,
YOU CAN GO CATATONIC.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.750
WE DON'T KNOW IF THIS
APPLIES TO PICTURES

09:45.752 --> 09:46.818
OF THE FROG OR NOT,

09:46.820 --> 09:47.886
BUT WHO WANTS
TO TAKE CHANCES.

09:47.888 --> 09:50.589
SO WHEN WE ROLL THIS FILM,
BE SURE TO LOOK AWAY.

09:50.591 --> 09:54.059
OKAY, ROLL
THE FILM, TOM.

09:56.597 --> 09:57.929
IS IT OVER?

09:57.931 --> 09:59.564
OKAY, IT'S OVER.

09:59.566 --> 10:00.565
WELL, THERE
YOU HAVE IT.

10:00.567 --> 10:02.801
UNDENIABLE PROOF THAT
THE MEXICAN STARING FROG

10:02.803 --> 10:04.035
OF SOUTHERN
SRI LANKA EXISTS.

10:04.037 --> 10:06.605
And you saw it here on
The Jimbo and Ned Show.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.139
DUDE, I CAN'T BELIEVE
THEY FELL FOR IT.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.041
YEAH, WHAT A COUPLE
OF DUMB ASSES.

10:10.043 --> 10:12.043
( mumbling )

10:12.045 --> 10:13.445
YEAH.

10:13.447 --> 10:15.380
COME ON WE GOTTA
GO MAKE ANOTHER ONE.

10:15.382 --> 10:16.982
LYING
KICKS ASS.

10:16.984 --> 10:17.983
JESUS!

10:17.985 --> 10:18.650
YEAH?

10:18.652 --> 10:19.584
WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

10:19.586 --> 10:21.252
THE JIMBO AND NED SHOW
MADE UP SOME RIDICULOUS

10:21.254 --> 10:23.021
STARING FROG STORY
AND JUMPED ANOTHER

10:23.023 --> 10:24.356
TWO POINTS IN
THE RATING.

10:24.358 --> 10:26.324
SO WHAT ARE WE
SUPPOSED TO DO?

10:26.326 --> 10:27.158
I DON'T KNOW.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.960
WE'LL HAVE TO CONTINUE
WITH THE CHANGES WE'VE MADE

10:28.962 --> 10:30.095
AND THEN GO
EVEN FURTHER.

10:30.097 --> 10:33.698
( male )
AN WE'RE BACK IN
FIVE, FOUR, THREE...

10:33.700 --> 10:35.967
REMEMBER,
BIG, BIG, BIG.

10:41.742 --> 10:42.907
IF YOU'RE JUST
JOINING US,

10:42.909 --> 10:45.243
WE'VE BEEN LISTENING
TO MICHELLE'S INCREDIBLE STORY

10:45.245 --> 10:46.077
OF SURVIVAL.

10:46.079 --> 10:46.845
GO ON, MICHELLE.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.246
WELL AS I WAS SAYING
I TRIED AND TRIED

10:48.248 --> 10:50.348
BUT MY OVERTURNED CAR
JUST WOULDN'T BUDGE.

10:50.350 --> 10:52.183
MY HUSBAND WAS TRAPPED
FOR 12 HOURS.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.487
AND YET SOMEHOW
HE MANAGED TO SURVIVE.

10:55.489 --> 10:56.354
THAT'S RIGHT.

10:56.356 --> 10:58.923
HE'S A VERY BRAVE MAN,
AND I LOVE HIM VERY MUCH.

10:58.925 --> 11:00.392
I LOVE YOU TOO.

11:00.394 --> 11:01.960
WELL, LET'S SEE IF
THE AUDIENCE

11:01.962 --> 11:03.161
HAS ANY
QUESTIONS.

11:03.163 --> 11:04.162
YES, YOU OVER THERE.

11:04.164 --> 11:08.767
I THINK SHE NEEDS
TO KICK HIM TO
THE CURB, BABY.

11:09.436 --> 11:10.935
KICK WHO
TO THE CURB?

11:10.937 --> 11:11.936
HER NO GOOD
HUSBAND.

11:11.938 --> 11:15.607
SHE'S GOT TO LOSE THAT ZERO
AND GET HERSELF A HERO.

11:15.609 --> 11:17.909
( woman )
HE WANTS TO HAVE
HIS CAKE AND EAT IT TOO.

11:17.911 --> 11:21.613
HE'S GOT TO DUMP
THAT TRASH, GIRLFRIEND.

11:21.615 --> 11:23.615
IT'S ALL ABOUT RESPECT.

11:23.617 --> 11:26.151
YOU GOTTA HAVE
RESPECT FOR YOURSELF.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.385
( applause )

11:27.387 --> 11:30.355
I THINK WE'VE SOMEWHAT
MISSED THE POINT HERE.

11:30.357 --> 11:31.823
LET'S GO TO
SOMEBODY ELSE.

11:31.825 --> 11:32.757
YES, YOUR COMMENTS.

11:32.759 --> 11:34.859
MONTEL, I THINK WE'RE
FORGETTING SOMETHING

11:34.861 --> 11:36.094
VERY IMPORTANT
IN ALL THIS.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.029
OKAY, SURE HE TOUCHED
SOME CHILDREN

11:38.031 --> 11:39.564
BUT THE MAN IS
A GREAT SINGER

11:39.566 --> 11:41.900
AND HE'S ENTERTAINED
US FOR SO MANY YEARS.

11:41.902 --> 11:43.401
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

11:43.403 --> 11:44.269
MICHAEL JACKSON.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.438
ALL THIS BAD MOUTHING,
PUTTING THE MAN DOWN.

11:46.440 --> 11:48.940
MAYBE HE DID TOUCH SOME
CHILDREN NOW AND THEN.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.109
BUT COME ON,
IT'S MICHAEL JACKSON.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.510
MICHAEL JACKSON!

11:53.513 --> 11:56.347
WE'LL BE BACK RIGHT
AFTER THESE MESSAGES.

11:56.349 --> 11:57.816
READY YOU GUYS?

11:57.818 --> 11:58.917
READY!
READY!

11:58.919 --> 12:00.418
OKAY, ACTION.

12:01.988 --> 12:05.190
I AM THE DEADLY
MEXICAN STARING FROG

12:05.192 --> 12:07.225
OF SOUTHERN SRI LANKA.

12:07.227 --> 12:10.829
I AM VERY SCARY
AND DANGEROUS.

12:10.831 --> 12:12.197
CUT!
CARTMAN!

12:12.199 --> 12:12.864
WHAT?

12:12.866 --> 12:14.065
IT'S SUPPOSED
TO BE A FROG.

12:14.067 --> 12:14.866
I KNOW THAT.

12:14.868 --> 12:16.067
SINCE WHEN DO
FROGS TALK, CARTMAN?

12:16.069 --> 12:17.702
IT'S A SRI LANKA FROG.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.404
<i>DER,</i> CARTMAN!

12:19.406 --> 12:20.271
DER YOURSELF,
HIPPY.

12:20.273 --> 12:22.173
JUST DO IT AGAIN,
AND DON'T MAKE IT TALK.

12:22.175 --> 12:24.809
OKAY, HERE WE GO,
ARE YOU READY, CARTMAN?

12:24.811 --> 12:26.377
I'M READY
<i>STEVEN SPIELBERG</i>!

12:26.379 --> 12:28.279
ACTION!

12:29.549 --> 12:31.349
WHY DO I HAVE TO DRESS UP
LIKE AN OLD LADY?

12:31.351 --> 12:32.917
'CAUSE OLD LADIES ARE
FAT AND YOU ARE TOO.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.353
COME ON CARTMAN,
THE WAY WE'RE
SHOOTING THIS,

12:35.355 --> 12:37.188
NOBODY WILL EVEN
KNOW IT'S YOU.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.156
THEY BETTER NOT.

12:38.158 --> 12:39.290
OKAY, WHEN
I YELL ACTION.

12:39.292 --> 12:40.391
YOU START TO
WALK THIS WAY,

12:40.393 --> 12:42.360
THEN KENNY'S GONNA PULL THE
PLASTIC FROG IN FRONT OF YOU

12:42.362 --> 12:43.461
AND YOU HAVE
TO BE SCARED.

12:43.463 --> 12:45.497
SCARED OF A
PLASTIC FROG?

12:45.499 --> 12:46.431
IT'S ACTING,
CARTMAN.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.699
YOU HAVE TO PRETEND
YOU'RE REALLY SCARED,

12:47.701 --> 12:49.501
THEN THE FROG WILL
LOOK YOU IN THE EYES,

12:49.503 --> 12:52.337
THEN YOU FALL
DOWN LIKE YOU'RE
DEAD, OKAY, READY?

12:52.339 --> 12:53.671
THIS IS STUPID.

12:53.673 --> 12:55.907
GOOD,
AND ACTION!

12:56.443 --> 12:58.109
AHH!

12:58.111 --> 12:59.911
IT APPEARS AS THOUGH
A LOT OF YOU SKEPTICS

12:59.913 --> 13:03.081
THOUGHT THE FILM WE SHOWED
OF THE MEXICAN STARING FROG

13:03.083 --> 13:05.283
OF SOUTHERN SRI LANKA
WAS A FAKE.

13:05.285 --> 13:07.252
THEY SAY IT DIDN'T
HARM ANYBODY.

13:07.254 --> 13:08.853
WELL, IT JUST
SO HAPPENS THAT

13:08.855 --> 13:10.288
WE JUST RECEIVED
ANOTHER FILM

13:10.290 --> 13:12.257
FROM ANOTHER
ANONYMOUS VIEWER.

13:12.259 --> 13:13.625
ROLL IT.

13:15.595 --> 13:17.428
Ahhh!

13:18.565 --> 13:19.531
THERE YOU GO.

13:19.533 --> 13:21.132
PROOF THAT NOT ONLY
IS THIS FROG REAL,

13:21.134 --> 13:23.868
BUT IT IS DOING HARM
TO THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH PARK

13:23.870 --> 13:25.003
AS WE SPEAK.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.738
DAMN, THAT FROG.

13:26.740 --> 13:27.605
WELL, THAT DOES IT.

13:27.607 --> 13:28.640
ALL THIS WEEK,
NED AND I WILL BE

13:28.642 --> 13:30.508
risking life from limb
as we go on location

13:30.510 --> 13:32.477
to hunt the Mexican
staring frog

13:32.479 --> 13:33.845
of southern Sri Lanka.

13:33.847 --> 13:34.813
Join us,
won't you?

13:34.815 --> 13:35.747
OH, NO, NO, NO.

13:35.749 --> 13:38.216
THIS IS THE BIGGEST PUBLICITY
STUNT I'VE EVER SEEN.

13:38.218 --> 13:40.218
DAMN, THOSE HUNTERS
ARE CLEVER.

13:40.220 --> 13:41.019
UH, CLEVER?

13:41.021 --> 13:42.220
IT'S GENIUS,
IT REALLY IS.

13:42.222 --> 13:43.788
HELL, I EVEN WANT
TO WATCH THEM HUNT

13:43.790 --> 13:45.590
THE MEXICAN
STARING FROG.

13:45.592 --> 13:46.491
UNLESS.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.292
UNLESS WHAT?

13:47.294 --> 13:48.493
UNLESS WE CAN
PROVE TO THE WORLD

13:48.495 --> 13:49.694
THAT THE WHOLE
THING'S A SHAM.

13:49.696 --> 13:51.496
IF WE PROVE THAT
THE MEXICAN STARING FROG

13:51.498 --> 13:52.363
OF SOUTHERN SRI LANKA

13:52.365 --> 13:54.165
IS JUST SOMETHING
MADE UP BY JIMBO AND NED,

13:54.167 --> 13:55.900
WE CAN HAVE THEM
TAKEN OFF THE AIR,

13:55.902 --> 13:56.768
PERHAPS EVEN KILLED.

13:56.770 --> 13:58.570
LOOK, WHY DON'T WE JUST
STICK TO OUR OWN SHOW?

13:58.572 --> 13:59.771
PEOPLE WILL
WATCH AGAIN.

13:59.773 --> 14:02.974
OH "J", YOU ARE
SO OMNIPOTENT,

14:02.976 --> 14:04.142
AND YET SO NAIVE.

14:04.144 --> 14:05.643
WE'LL LAUNCH A FULL
INVESTIGATION

14:05.645 --> 14:07.579
AND IN THE MEANTIME
WE CAN CASH IN

14:07.581 --> 14:08.780
ON THE VIDEOTAPES.

14:08.782 --> 14:09.647
WHAT VIDEOTAPES?

14:09.649 --> 14:11.916
Ye my children, I'm
the way in the life....

14:11.918 --> 14:13.284
YOU'VE SEEN
"JESUS AND PALS".

14:13.286 --> 14:14.953
NOW YOU'VE GOT
TO GET THE VIDEO.

14:14.955 --> 14:16.888
"JESUS AND PALS
TOO HOT FOR TV".

14:16.890 --> 14:19.824
THINGS GET A LITTLE
OUT OF OF CONTROL.

14:19.826 --> 14:22.493
YOU WON'T
BELIEVE YOUR EYES.

14:23.864 --> 14:29.067
REMEMBER, THIS IS STUFF
YOU CAN'T SEE ON TV.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.134
( Jimbo )
ANONYMOUS TIP?

14:30.136 --> 14:31.336
YEAH, IT WAS LEFT ON
OUR ANSWERING MACHINE.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.238
ALL IT SAID WAS THAT THEY
SAW THE MEXICAN STARING FROG

14:33.240 --> 14:35.540
JUST SOUTH
OF STARK'S POND
THIS MORNING.

14:35.542 --> 14:36.307
HEY NED,

14:36.309 --> 14:38.376
REMEMBER THAT TIME WE GOTTA
ANONYMOUS TIP BACK IN 'NAM?

14:38.378 --> 14:40.478
YOU WERE IN 'NAM?
WHERE WERE YOU STATIONED?

14:40.480 --> 14:41.679
DA NANG.

14:41.681 --> 14:43.014
WITH THE
LOG RIDE?

14:43.016 --> 14:43.748
YUP.

14:43.750 --> 14:44.649
MAN, I WAS IN TET.

14:44.651 --> 14:45.850
WE HAD A BAD-ASS
ROLLERCOASTER

14:45.852 --> 14:47.819
BUT ALL WE EVER
WANTED WAS A LOG RIDE.

14:47.821 --> 14:51.022
WE WAITED AND WE WAITED
BUT THEY NEVER BUILT US ONE.

14:51.024 --> 14:53.558
I THINK DANFORTH
WANTED A LOG RIDE

14:53.560 --> 14:56.060
MORE THAN ANYBODY
BUT HE HAD TO SETTLE

14:56.062 --> 14:59.130
WITH THAT LAME DINOSAUR
WATER ADVENTURE RIDE.

14:59.132 --> 15:01.132
THAT WAR WAS HELL
ON EVERYBODY.

15:01.134 --> 15:03.701
GOOD, OKAY, OKAY BYE.

15:03.703 --> 15:04.802
GREAT NEWS,
EVERYBODY.

15:04.804 --> 15:06.838
THIS WEEK'S RATINGS
ARE THROUGH THE ROOF.

15:06.840 --> 15:08.273
WE'RE UP TO
20 PEOPLE.

15:08.275 --> 15:09.774
WOW, DO WE GET
MORE MONEY?

15:09.776 --> 15:10.642
NO, BUT I DO.

15:10.644 --> 15:12.277
WE'RE NOW THE
HIGHEST RATED SHOW

15:12.279 --> 15:13.411
ON MOUNTAIN
CABLE ACCESS.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.113
GOD BLESS
THE MEXICAN
STARING FROG.

15:15.115 --> 15:17.282
DUDE, THEY'RE GONNA
LOOK SO STUPID.

15:17.284 --> 15:18.016
TOTALLY.

15:18.018 --> 15:19.617
THEY DESERVE IT FOR
LYING TO US, DUDE.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.753
REVENGE IS SO
VERY, VERY SWEET.

15:21.755 --> 15:24.589
THEY'RE HERE,
HURRY AND HIDE.

15:26.092 --> 15:26.858
LET'S HUNT.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.293
WE'LL START WITH A
TWO-SHOT OF YOU AND NED

15:28.295 --> 15:30.461
GETTING YOUR EQUIPMENT
TOGETHER AND...

15:30.463 --> 15:31.663
JIMBO LOOK!

15:31.665 --> 15:33.097
HIT THE DECK!

15:33.099 --> 15:33.798
WHAT IS IT?

15:33.800 --> 15:35.466
IT'S HIM, THE
MEXICAN STARING FROG

15:35.468 --> 15:36.434
OF SOUTHERN SRI LANKA.

15:36.436 --> 15:38.303
HE'S RIGHT OVER
THERE ON THAT ROCK.

15:38.305 --> 15:38.970

15:38.972 --> 15:41.205
DUMB ASS, YOU'VE GOTTA
KEEP YOUR EYES AWAY FROM HIM.

15:41.207 --> 15:42.040
STAY DOWN.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.241
NED, YOU TAKE
FLIGHT POSITION.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.176
I'LL TRY AND KEEP IT
TURNED AWAY FROM YOU.

15:45.178 --> 15:46.110
ROGER THAT.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.111
HELLO FELLOW HUNTERS.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.515
THE MEXICAN STARING FROG
IS SUNNING ITSELF

15:50.517 --> 15:51.950
ON A ROCK DIRECTLY
BEHIND US.

15:51.952 --> 15:53.785
WE'VE GOT TO TAKE
THE FROG BY SURPRISE.

15:53.787 --> 15:57.522
I'M GONNA CREATE A
DIVERSION USING THIS DEVICE.

15:57.524 --> 15:59.857
WHILE NED WILL AMBUSH
HIM FROM THE REAR.

15:59.859 --> 16:02.593

16:02.595 --> 16:04.162
QUICK, NED!

YOUR BUTTS.

16:22.449 --> 16:25.483

16:30.223 --> 16:32.190
GET THE FIGHT
FOR LIFE HELICOPTER.

16:32.192 --> 16:33.157
HOLY CRAP, DUDE.

16:33.159 --> 16:36.427
"BUT PONY BOY WAS
BEAT UP PRETTY BAD.

16:36.429 --> 16:39.397
HE KEPT SAYING
STAY GOAL".

16:39.399 --> 16:42.700
OH NED,
IF YOU CAN HEAR ME,

16:42.702 --> 16:43.768
YOU GOTTA SNAP OUT OF IT.

16:43.770 --> 16:46.471
'CAUSE IF YOU DON'T,
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE MYSELF.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.605
OH STANLEY,
HE'S GONE!

16:47.607 --> 16:49.374
MY ONLY FRIEND IN
THE WORLD IS GONE.

16:49.376 --> 16:52.110
DUDE, HE'S OKAY,
THAT FROG WASN'T EVEN REAL.

16:52.112 --> 16:52.810
LOOK.

16:52.812 --> 16:54.278
OH, WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING?

16:54.280 --> 16:55.713
I ALMOST LOOKED
RIGHT AT IT.

16:55.715 --> 16:57.782
DUDE, IT'S JUST
A PLASTIC FROG.

16:57.784 --> 16:58.449
WHAT?

16:58.451 --> 17:00.184
WE SHOT ALL THOSE VIDEOS
AND SENT THEM IN.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.352
YEAH, WE MADE
THE WHOLE THING UP.

17:01.354 --> 17:03.321
IT WAS ALL JUST A REALLY,
REALLY FUNNY JOKE.

17:03.323 --> 17:05.189
YOU SENT IN ALL
THOSE VIDEOS?

17:05.191 --> 17:06.424
OH, THIS
IS NOT GOOD.

17:06.426 --> 17:07.725
MY BEST FRIEND
IS A VEGETABLE,

17:07.727 --> 17:10.695
AND I'M GONNA BE
THE LAUGHING STOCK
OF SOUTH PARK.

17:10.697 --> 17:11.829
OH COME ON,
NED'S FAKING IT.

17:11.831 --> 17:13.598
THAT FROG WAS JUST
A PIECE OF PLASTIC.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.133
YEAH, COME ON,
NED, QUIT FAKING.

17:15.135 --> 17:17.001
YOU BOYS DON'T
UNDERSTAND.

17:17.003 --> 17:19.037
NED WAS SO FREAKED OUT
BY THE IDEA

17:19.039 --> 17:20.171
OF THE MEXICAN
STARING FROG

17:20.173 --> 17:22.740
THAT HE MUST HAVE SENT
HIMSELF INTO A DEEP COMA.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.442
IT'S A
PSYCHOSOMATIC
RESPONSE.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.210
I COULDN'T HELP
OVERHEARING

17:26.212 --> 17:28.112
YOUR CONVERSATION
JUST NOW.

17:28.114 --> 17:28.946
WHO ARE YOU?

17:28.948 --> 17:30.982
I PRODUCE A LITTLE TV SHOW
CALLED "JESUS AND PALS".

17:30.984 --> 17:32.984
YOUR STORY'S AMAZING,
FULL OF JEALOUSY,

17:32.986 --> 17:35.453
DUPLICITY, BACK STABBING,
AND BITTERNESS.

17:35.455 --> 17:36.454
UH, THANKS.

17:36.456 --> 17:38.689
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO SHARE
YOUR REMARKABLE STORY

17:38.691 --> 17:41.159

TOMORROW'S SHOW?

17:41.895 --> 17:43.928
WE'RE BACK WITH JIMBO
AND HIS NEPHEW, STAN.

17:43.930 --> 17:46.397
THESE KIDS CAN'T
STOP LYING, CAN THEY?

17:46.399 --> 17:47.365
THAT'S RIGHT,
JESUS.

17:47.367 --> 17:48.966
NO RESPECT
FOR THEIR ELDERS.

17:48.968 --> 17:50.134
AS SOME OF YOU
MAY KNOW,

17:50.136 --> 17:52.003
I HOST A LOCAL
SHOW ON HUNTING.

17:52.005 --> 17:53.404
THANKS.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.106
WE'VE BEEN HUNTING
THE MEXICAN STARING FROG

17:55.108 --> 17:57.041
FOR A WEEK BASED ON
SOME VIDEO FOOTAGE

17:57.043 --> 17:58.543
WE RECEIVED
FROM A VIEWER.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.645
IT TURNS OUT
THAT THESE KIDS

18:00.647 --> 18:02.180
FAKED THE
FOOTAGE.

18:02.182 --> 18:03.214
IS THAT TRUE, STAN?

18:03.216 --> 18:04.115
IT WAS
JUST A JOKE.

18:04.117 --> 18:05.616
WE DIDN'T THINK
IT WOULD HURT ANYBODY.

18:05.618 --> 18:08.019
WE'LL FIND OUT MORE
ABOUT THIS DEBAUCHERY

18:08.021 --> 18:09.220
WHEN WE RETURN.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.589

LIKE WHAT?

18:16.262 --> 18:18.129
GO AHEAD AND TELL
HOW YOUR NEPHEW STAN

18:18.131 --> 18:20.298
TAKES DRUGS AND
WORSHIPS SATAN.

18:20.300 --> 18:21.265
SATAN, GOT IT.

18:21.267 --> 18:22.934
I DON'T TAKE DRUGS
AND WORSHIP SATAN,
THAT'S LYING.

18:22.936 --> 18:24.869
GIVE YOU A TASTE OF
YOUR OWN MEDICINE!

18:24.871 --> 18:26.637
I DIDN'T BRING YOU ON
THIS SHOW TO BE BORING.

18:26.639 --> 18:30.041
SOMEBODY GET PISSED OFF AND
THROW A CHAIR AT NED HERE.

18:30.043 --> 18:30.675
DIBS?

18:30.677 --> 18:32.276
REMEMBER, YOU ALL
START A FIGHT

18:32.278 --> 18:33.911
AFTER THE CHAIR
IS THROWN.

18:33.913 --> 18:35.379
THAT'S YOUR CUE.

18:35.381 --> 18:35.980

18:40.854 --> 18:41.752
I'LL TELL YOU WHY.

18:41.754 --> 18:46.124
BECAUSE HE'S ON DRUGS AND
HE WORSHIPS THE DEVIL.

18:47.393 --> 18:50.394
( chanting )
JESUS, JESUS, JESUS!

18:50.396 --> 18:51.596
NOW STANLEY,
IT SOUNDS LIKE

18:51.598 --> 18:53.331
YOU'RE UNCLE'S REALLY
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

18:53.333 --> 18:57.335
WELL, I ONLY DID IT
'CAUSE HE MOLESTED ME.

18:58.037 --> 18:59.871
WHY YOU LITTLE

19:00.940 --> 19:02.907
THAT'S IT, NOW

JESUS, JESUS, JESUS!

19:09.349 --> 19:10.882

19:10.884 --> 19:12.483

19:14.254 --> 19:15.653
LET'S WATCH
THE LANGUAGE, PEOPLE.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.854
BRING IT ON,

19:16.856 --> 19:18.656
GET OFF OF HIM
YOU!@#$% NUT-SACK!

19:18.658 --> 19:21.159
( chanting )
JESUS, JESUS, JESUS!

19:21.161 --> 19:25.129
LET'S ALL JUST MAKE OUR

19:26.065 --> 19:28.432
OH MY GOD,

19:28.434 --> 19:30.434
YOU BASTARDS!

19:33.673 --> 19:37.175
LET'S ALL JUST MAKE OUR
WAY BACK TO OUR SEATS.

19:38.344 --> 19:40.645
SHUT THE!@#$% UP!

19:41.781 --> 19:43.948
JESUS, WHAT IS
WRONG WITH YOUR PEOPLE?

19:43.950 --> 19:45.082
LOOK AROUND
YOU STANLEY.

19:45.084 --> 19:47.185
LOOK AT THE ALL
THE PAIN AND SUFFERING

19:47.187 --> 19:48.186
YOUR LIE
HAS CAUSED.

19:48.188 --> 19:49.687
WE ONLY DID IT BECAUSE
JIMBO LIED TO US FIRST.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.622
WE HAD THIS REPORT ON
THE VIETNAM WAR FOR SCHOOL

19:51.624 --> 19:53.191
AND WE INTERVIEWED
JIMBO ABOUT IT.

19:53.193 --> 19:54.425
AND HE MADE UP
ALL THIS STUFF

19:54.427 --> 19:55.693
ABOUT VIETNAM,
HE GOT US IN TROUBLE.

19:55.695 --> 19:58.462
EVERYTHING I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THE WAR HAPPENED.

19:58.464 --> 19:59.764
MR. GARRISON SAID
THERE'S NO WAY

19:59.766 --> 20:02.800
YOU COULD'VE DEFEATED
THE ENTIRE VIETCONG
ARMY BY YOURSELF.

20:02.802 --> 20:04.468
THE ENTIRE
VIETCONG ARMY?

20:04.470 --> 20:07.004
WELL OKAY, I MIGHT
HAVE EMBELLISHED THE TRUTH

20:07.006 --> 20:09.006
A LITTLE BUT
THAT'S DIFFERENT.

20:09.008 --> 20:09.840
IS IT?

20:09.842 --> 20:11.409
WELL SURE,
I MEAN...

20:11.411 --> 20:13.177
WELL, NO,
I GUESS NOT.

20:13.179 --> 20:14.178
AND AS FOR
YOU, STAN,

20:14.180 --> 20:15.513
I THINK YOU NEED TO
KICK YOUR DRUG HABIT.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.381
WAIT A SECOND,
I DON'T TAKE DRUGS,
THAT WAS A LIE.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.016
WAIT, JIMBO
MADE THAT UP?

20:19.018 --> 20:20.084
NO, YOUR
PRODUCER DID.

20:20.086 --> 20:22.620
SHE MADE JIMBO TELL
EVERYBODY THAT I DID DRUGS.

20:22.622 --> 20:23.321
WHAT!

20:23.323 --> 20:24.822
DURING THE BREAK YOUR
PRODUCER CAME OVER

20:24.824 --> 20:26.457
AND TOLD JIMBO WHAT
TO SAY ABOUT ME.

20:26.459 --> 20:27.725
SHE TOLD
HIM TO LIE.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.060
IT'S TRUE,
SHE DID.

20:29.062 --> 20:30.928
I'M SUCH A FOOL.

20:30.930 --> 20:32.029
OH, REALLY.

20:32.031 --> 20:34.198
YEAH, THEN SHE TOLD US
TO THROW A CHAIR AT NED.

20:34.200 --> 20:36.367
YEAH, I DIDN'T
WANT TO DO IT, JESUS.

20:36.369 --> 20:37.335
SHE MADE ME
DO THAT.

20:37.337 --> 20:39.070
SCREW THIS SHOW,
I THOUGHT THIS
WAS ALL REAL!

20:39.072 --> 20:41.005
WAIT, EVERYBODY,
COME BACK.

20:41.007 --> 20:42.306
DON'T FEEL
TOO BAD, MONTEL,

20:42.308 --> 20:47.778
WE ALL WANNA TOUCH
CHILDREN SOMETIMES,
IT'S ONLY NATURAL.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.080
I'M SORRY, STAN.

20:49.082 --> 20:51.282
I WAS JUST TRYING
TO TELL A GOOD STORY.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.651
I NEVER MEANT FOR YOU BOYS
TO GET IN TROUBLE.

20:53.653 --> 20:54.919
WE'RE SORRY TOO,
UNCLE JIMBO.

20:54.921 --> 20:56.587
WE'RE SORRY FOR MAKING
YOU TWO LOOK STUPID

20:56.589 --> 20:57.722
IN FRONT OF
THE WHOLE WORLD.

20:57.724 --> 20:59.090
AND FOR TURNING NED
INTO A VEGETABLE.

20:59.092 --> 21:00.992
HE'LL BE FINE,
I'LL JUST TAKE HIM HOME

21:00.994 --> 21:02.326
AND SHOW HIM SOME
GOOD HARD-CORE PORN.

21:02.328 --> 21:04.395
HE'LL SNAP RIGHT OUT
OF IT, WON'T YOU, NED?

21:04.397 --> 21:07.398
I WANT TO APOLOGIZE
FOR WHAT HAPPENED IN THERE.

21:07.400 --> 21:08.799
IN OUR COMPETITION
FOR RATINGS,

21:08.801 --> 21:11.335
WE ALL LOST SIGHT OF
WHY WE GOT INTO SHOW BUSINESS

21:11.337 --> 21:12.270
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

21:12.272 --> 21:13.671
YEAH,
TITTIES AND BEER.

21:13.673 --> 21:15.206
ACTUALLY,
I WAS REFERRING MORE

21:15.208 --> 21:16.440
TO THE PURSUIT
OF TRUTH.

21:16.442 --> 21:18.376
BUT, I CAN'T WAIT TO GET
BACK TO MY OLD SHOW

21:18.378 --> 21:20.945
WITHOUT ALL THE GLITZ AND
RATINGS AND PRODUCERS...

21:20.947 --> 21:22.980
WAIT A SEC,
WHERE IS YOUR PRODUCER?

21:22.982 --> 21:23.881
I SENT HER AWAY.

21:23.883 --> 21:26.284
SENT HER
AWAY WHERE?

21:26.919 --> 21:29.053
WHAT IS THIS?
WHAT'S HAPPENING?!

21:29.055 --> 21:32.056
WELCOME
TO MY DOMINION.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.424
AHH!

21:33.426 --> 21:35.359
HEY, TAKE A LOAD OFF,
PUT YOUR FEET UP.

21:35.361 --> 21:37.828
ME AND SATAN WERE JUST
ABOUT TO GO SHOPPING

21:37.830 --> 21:38.796
FOR FURNITURE.

21:38.798 --> 21:39.964
COME ON, SATAN.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.766
OKAY, HONEY.

21:41.768 --> 21:42.933
NO!
