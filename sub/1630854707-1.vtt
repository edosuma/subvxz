00:12.750 --> 00:14.117
<i>My daughter,
she said to see you.</i>

00:14.217 --> 00:15.383
<i>She said that
you're the mayor now.</i>

00:17.117 --> 00:18.283
<i>Sorry about
your brother, man.</i>

00:18.383 --> 00:19.783
You gonna take some time?

00:19.883 --> 00:21.117
No. No, no, I'm good.

00:21.217 --> 00:23.150
Couriers, fix-it men.

00:23.249 --> 00:26.683
<i>What you do,
your father invented it.</i>

00:26.783 --> 00:28.683
- Where is the money?
- The police.

00:28.783 --> 00:30.717
That's going to be
a problem for you.

00:33.883 --> 00:35.617
Don't ever threaten me again.

00:35.717 --> 00:38.183
He's different than his brother,
send someone else.

00:38.283 --> 00:39.650
Who?

00:39.750 --> 00:41.017
<i>Where's Iris?</i>

00:41.117 --> 00:42.517
- <i>Who sent you?
-</i> [Iris] <i>Milo.</i>

00:42.617 --> 00:43.550
He's my boss.

00:43.650 --> 00:44.750
<i>You should go back.</i>

00:44.850 --> 00:46.383
<i>I'm stronger
than you think.</i>

00:46.483 --> 00:47.783
- That's him?
- Yeah.

00:49.717 --> 00:51.717
Better yet, this maggot
doesn't make it to court.

00:51.817 --> 00:53.650
<i>They're gonna look
the other way on this.</i>

00:54.683 --> 00:55.883
How far the other way
they gonna look?

00:55.983 --> 00:56.817
Far.

00:56.917 --> 01:00.883
You owe them.
You all owe them.

01:00.983 --> 01:02.417
<i>They want their favors.</i>

01:02.517 --> 01:03.350
What kind of favors?

01:03.450 --> 01:04.483
The unreasonable kind.

01:04.583 --> 01:05.583
- Who?
- <i>All of them</i> .

01:05.683 --> 01:06.650
God...

01:06.750 --> 01:07.750
What the--

01:08.917 --> 01:11.483
Everything you have,
I'm taking it all back.

01:11.583 --> 01:12.817
<i>Do you wanna start a war?</i>

01:12.917 --> 01:14.450
They broke their word, Mike!

01:14.550 --> 01:16.017
<i>They hungry for this.</i>

01:23.150 --> 01:25.317
This like a revolution.

01:25.417 --> 01:28.417
<i>It's time
somebody sent a message.</i>

01:28.517 --> 01:29.883
The messenger's me.

03:00.650 --> 03:01.583
Stop.

03:02.750 --> 03:03.917
Big step.

03:08.917 --> 03:10.017
Turn this way.

03:10.517 --> 03:11.483
Quick.

03:15.050 --> 03:17.116
Take my hand.
Take a big step.

03:18.317 --> 03:19.350
There you go.

03:19.950 --> 03:21.017
Can I take
this fucking thing off?

03:21.116 --> 03:22.783
No, you can't.
Sit down.

04:01.783 --> 04:03.417
You can take it off, now.

04:18.850 --> 04:20.417
Come on.
There you go.

04:23.750 --> 04:25.216
How 'bout this, huh?

04:27.783 --> 04:30.317
There's no bears in
the middle of the lake, right?

04:30.317 --> 04:31.450
Mm.

04:32.116 --> 04:33.350
So, whose is it?

04:34.049 --> 04:35.350
It's a drug seizure.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.317
Goes to auction next week.

04:38.883 --> 04:40.317
You know how to sail?

04:41.917 --> 04:43.383
I don't have a fuckin' clue.

04:44.417 --> 04:46.383
But it's got a steering wheel
and an engine,

04:46.483 --> 04:47.717
and I can drive, so...

04:48.116 --> 04:49.317
There we go.

04:51.683 --> 04:52.917
So, where are we goin'?

04:53.583 --> 04:54.617
I don't know.

04:55.783 --> 04:57.650
Figured we'd just go out in
the middle of the lake.

04:58.450 --> 04:59.483
Just anchor there.

05:00.082 --> 05:02.116
You can't sleep, I don't sleep.

05:02.216 --> 05:04.650
Somethin' about the sway of
the boat cures both, huh?

05:04.982 --> 05:06.617
Maybe we could take it somewhere.

05:06.717 --> 05:07.850
Get dinner.

05:07.949 --> 05:10.049
Nah, I'll make us dinner.
In the galley.

05:10.949 --> 05:11.883
What's a galley?

05:11.982 --> 05:14.116
Galley is boat for "kitchen".

05:14.216 --> 05:15.450
There's a kitchen?

05:15.550 --> 05:16.650
Yeah, I know.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.817
Here, you wanna see
the best part of the boat?

05:43.617 --> 05:46.883
<i>My father used to say,
"I can't wait to get old.</i>

05:47.450 --> 05:50.949
<i>For my mind to soften.
For my memories to rot away.</i>

05:51.617 --> 05:53.483
<i>The hardest thing
to do is forget.</i>

05:53.883 --> 05:56.016
<i>Forget the scars life gives yo,</i>

05:56.116 --> 05:58.216
<i>forget the scars
you gave others.</i>

05:58.982 --> 06:00.650
<i>The challenge, though,</i>

06:00.750 --> 06:03.650
<i>is hiding a few memories worth
keeping from your dying mind."</i>

06:04.317 --> 06:05.783
<i>He told me to keep a journal,</i>

06:06.149 --> 06:07.650
<i>and only write down
the good things.</i>

06:08.149 --> 06:09.850
<i>Then when the bad things
fade away,</i>

06:10.683 --> 06:12.783
<i>you can read about
the happy life you had.</i>

06:28.483 --> 06:30.317
<i>But minds don't
forget so easy.</i>

06:30.949 --> 06:33.982
<i>When the horror that we witness
and endure takes root,</i>

06:34.617 --> 06:37.216
<i>only madness and
dementia can remove it.</i>

06:49.982 --> 06:51.517
<i>Shit...</i>

07:35.849 --> 07:36.916
No!
No!

07:37.016 --> 07:38.149
- Fuck, no!
- Kareem!

07:38.317 --> 07:39.450
No!

07:39.550 --> 07:41.182
Look at me!

07:41.317 --> 07:42.417
- No!
- Kareem!

07:42.517 --> 07:45.016
- No, no!
- Look at me!

07:45.116 --> 07:46.949
- No!
- Look at me!

07:47.049 --> 07:48.417
You're okay, baby!

07:48.517 --> 07:49.717
You're okay!

07:50.182 --> 07:51.683
This is home!

07:51.782 --> 07:53.350
You're home!

07:57.016 --> 07:58.149
Mom?

07:58.849 --> 08:00.082
Now, go back to bed!

08:05.450 --> 08:06.816
Look at me, honey.

08:09.116 --> 08:10.483
You're okay.

08:13.750 --> 08:14.949
You're okay.

08:20.417 --> 08:23.683
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

08:30.317 --> 08:32.317
Want the light off?

08:34.483 --> 08:35.782
No, leave it on.

09:13.849 --> 09:16.216
Bitch-ass nigga,
fuck outta here, nigga!

09:16.317 --> 09:17.216
Get up!

09:22.650 --> 09:23.583
Fuck that!

09:26.816 --> 09:28.082
Oh, shit!

09:40.350 --> 09:42.317
Beat down on Row 18,
tent 154.

09:42.417 --> 09:43.682
Do we give a shit?

09:45.082 --> 09:46.517
Didn't think so.

09:47.317 --> 09:48.650
<i>The consequence of a riot</i>

09:48.749 --> 09:50.716
<i>is the dismantling of
the illusion that</i>

09:50.816 --> 09:52.949
<i>prison is controlled by
the guards.</i>

09:53.716 --> 09:55.617
<i>The consequence of putting
down the riot</i>

09:55.716 --> 09:57.882
<i>is the dismantling of
the leadership structure</i>

09:57.982 --> 09:59.149
<i>within the inmates.</i>

09:59.716 --> 10:01.450
<i>All that remains is chaos,</i>

10:01.949 --> 10:04.249
<i>until a new leadership structure
is created.</i>

10:04.882 --> 10:06.583
<i>And when there are
no leaders inside,</i>

10:07.149 --> 10:08.583
<i>there are no leaders outside.</i>

10:09.049 --> 10:10.450
<i>All gangs are from prison,</i>

10:10.550 --> 10:12.882
<i>because that's where all
gangsters end up.</i>

10:21.617 --> 10:23.550
<i>The result is
our new reality.</i>

10:26.350 --> 10:28.016
<i>And that reality
is chaos.</i>

Drop the weapon!
Drop the weapon!

12:12.016 --> 12:13.649
I only ask three times.

12:22.649 --> 12:24.450
Iris!
You ready?

12:25.716 --> 12:26.716
Hey!

12:28.350 --> 12:29.582
We gotta go.

12:30.882 --> 12:32.049
Go where?

12:32.149 --> 12:34.182
Gotta get you back to the cabin,
so I can go to work.

12:34.317 --> 12:36.417
I don't wanna go to the cabin!

12:36.516 --> 12:37.849
I wanna stay here.

12:38.483 --> 12:39.816
It's not my boat.

12:41.483 --> 12:43.816
You said they don't sell it
for a week, right?

12:46.582 --> 12:48.116
So, can I keep it for a week?

12:48.649 --> 12:50.749
What are you gonna do, hang out
on the boat all day long?

12:51.116 --> 12:52.882
It's no smaller than
your cabin.

12:54.582 --> 12:55.616
Fuck, all right, well...

12:55.949 --> 12:58.016
Just don't go anywhere,
wanderin' around.

12:58.649 --> 12:59.982
You have no idea who's
lookin' for you.

13:00.082 --> 13:01.082
All right?

13:02.016 --> 13:03.149
Aye aye, Captain.

13:05.616 --> 13:06.782
Hey, Mike.

13:08.016 --> 13:08.982
Thank you.

13:09.716 --> 13:10.482
All right, all right.

13:10.582 --> 13:11.749
<i>Fuck!</i>

13:11.849 --> 13:13.082
<i>Goddamn.</i>

13:13.749 --> 13:15.816
Don't go anywhere!

13:37.916 --> 13:38.816
It's Mike.

13:38.916 --> 13:40.049
Mike.

13:40.149 --> 13:42.182
You gotta get down here.
Somethin' you need to see.

13:42.317 --> 13:43.216
Where are you?

13:43.317 --> 13:44.749
<i>Grape and 24th.</i>

13:45.716 --> 13:46.982
All right, I'm on my way.

13:48.417 --> 13:49.716
Christ.

13:49.816 --> 13:51.082
Should we call Animal Control?

13:51.182 --> 13:52.317
The fuck are they gonna do?

13:52.417 --> 13:53.416
You wanna open the door
to this thing?

13:53.516 --> 13:54.482
I say we shoot it.

13:54.882 --> 13:55.982
<i>Lotta cell phones
are out.</i>

13:56.082 --> 13:58.082
Soon as that thing climbs
through that sunroof,

13:58.182 --> 13:59.049
we're shootin' it anyway.

13:59.149 --> 14:00.549
That guy is dead.

14:00.649 --> 14:02.216
That thing, it's-it's
fuckin' eatin' a man is all.

14:02.317 --> 14:03.149
Fuck!

14:03.317 --> 14:04.982
Fuck, fuck!

14:10.882 --> 14:12.016
<i>Fuck.</i>

14:12.116 --> 14:13.317
All right, we're good.

14:13.616 --> 14:15.049
<i>Okay.</i>

14:19.549 --> 14:20.949
He's good, let him through!

14:22.082 --> 14:22.982
What's up?

14:23.082 --> 14:24.149
First thing in
the fuckin' morning.

14:24.749 --> 14:25.849
Uh-huh.

14:27.716 --> 14:29.049
What have we got?

14:29.782 --> 14:31.816
Ah, fuck, Ian, Jesus!
How 'bout a little warning?

14:31.916 --> 14:33.449
Fuckin' pitbull
through the sunroof.

14:33.549 --> 14:35.317
I'm just gonna go out on
a fuckin' limb here

14:35.317 --> 14:36.482
and say it's gang-related.

14:36.582 --> 14:37.616
Until they sort out who's
in charge inside,

14:37.716 --> 14:38.682
this is what it's gonna be.

14:38.782 --> 14:39.982
Fuckin' disgusting.

14:41.582 --> 14:43.317
<i>Robert's team hit a depot
at the Towers.</i>

14:44.116 --> 14:45.149
<i>Fuck.</i>

14:46.516 --> 14:48.317
- How much product?
- It's gonna sting.

14:48.416 --> 14:50.382
Yeah?
Jesus.

14:50.716 --> 14:52.882
Some Blood called in dispatch
with a tip.

14:53.516 --> 14:54.882
What the fuck
are we supposed to do?

14:55.549 --> 14:56.616
Well, Ian...

14:56.716 --> 14:58.350
You make it really fuckin' hard.

14:58.449 --> 15:00.549
To peace when you're raiding

15:00.649 --> 15:02.182
peacekeeper's fuckin'
cook houses.

15:03.317 --> 15:05.682
<i>Mike, we gotta get that fuckin'
genie back in the bottle.</i>

15:05.782 --> 15:07.317
Yeah, just meet me at Don's
in an hour.

15:07.317 --> 15:08.216
- Okay?
- Yeah.

15:08.317 --> 15:09.349
And bring Robert with ya.

15:09.449 --> 15:10.382
Yeah.

15:11.616 --> 15:12.749
I was just gonna call you.

15:12.849 --> 15:14.449
These turncoat motherfuckers

15:14.549 --> 15:16.382
ask me to stand down
and make a truce,

15:16.482 --> 15:18.616
and they toss my fuckin'
cook house?!

15:18.716 --> 15:20.182
I'm on my fuckin' way.
All right?

15:20.317 --> 15:22.349
- Yeah, I'm at the shop.
- <i>20 minutes.</i>

15:22.449 --> 15:24.349
Hey!
Make it two hours!

15:24.449 --> 15:25.549
Yep!

16:07.049 --> 16:08.549
Open gate nine.

16:58.349 --> 16:59.382
Well...

16:59.816 --> 17:01.049
I guess, every...

17:01.416 --> 17:02.816
I'm sorry.

17:02.916 --> 17:05.782
Could you, could you step back?
I can't see my students.

17:05.882 --> 17:07.316
Thank you very much.

17:07.616 --> 17:08.816
Um...

17:08.916 --> 17:12.349
Every life is a...
Is a serious of choices.

17:12.916 --> 17:14.549
Regardless of your environment,

17:14.649 --> 17:18.349
regardless of the struggles
that each of you have faced...

17:20.316 --> 17:23.182
You made a choice
that put you here.

17:23.316 --> 17:26.916
Your removal from society
is your punishment.

17:27.616 --> 17:29.782
You know, but don't think for...

17:33.082 --> 17:37.982
Don't think for a minute that
you are out of choices.

17:38.416 --> 17:39.882
You're not.

17:39.982 --> 17:42.749
The fact that you're sitting
here in this classroom right now

17:42.849 --> 17:44.182
is proof of that.

17:44.882 --> 17:47.516
You made a choice to be here.

17:47.916 --> 17:52.082
And each day, you will choose
whether to study,

17:52.516 --> 17:53.816
or whether to blow this off.

17:54.416 --> 17:58.682
Each day, you will choose
whether prison will one day

17:58.782 --> 18:00.516
just be part of your past...

18:01.449 --> 18:03.316
Or be your only future.

18:04.416 --> 18:05.516
Each day...

18:07.616 --> 18:08.549
Sorry.

18:08.982 --> 18:10.849
You know, we, we can't think

18:10.949 --> 18:13.782
with storm troopers
pacing the room.

18:14.316 --> 18:17.149
You have to leave,
or class is over.

18:17.682 --> 18:19.382
All right.
Everybody up!

18:19.982 --> 18:21.316
What?

18:21.616 --> 18:22.949
Move!

18:26.316 --> 18:28.181
Pick up the pace,
ladies!

18:49.649 --> 18:53.349
Do you feel the incident has
affected your mental wellbeing?

19:00.949 --> 19:03.782
To be honest, Doctor,
I'm just...

19:03.882 --> 19:05.516
Grateful to be alive.

19:06.582 --> 19:09.082
And look in the eyes of my wife
and children.

19:18.082 --> 19:19.982
You reported no sexual assault.

19:21.148 --> 19:21.882
No.

19:22.582 --> 19:26.016
Two other guards stated that
they witnessed your rape

19:26.115 --> 19:28.949
by multiple partners,
before they were raped?

19:30.215 --> 19:32.949
They've confused me
with someone else.

19:35.516 --> 19:38.982
It's common for victims
of sexual assault

19:39.081 --> 19:40.816
to deny the act took place

19:40.916 --> 19:43.049
out of shame that
they shouldn't feel.

19:45.849 --> 19:48.749
Doctor, if I had been
sexually assaulted,

19:48.849 --> 19:52.849
I would join a class action suit
against the Bureau of Prisons

19:52.949 --> 19:54.316
and the state,

19:54.582 --> 19:55.949
and be...

19:56.049 --> 19:58.882
Very happy to retire
with their money.

20:00.148 --> 20:02.782
I was beaten and...

20:02.882 --> 20:04.048
Threatened with death,

20:04.148 --> 20:06.716
both of those are known risks
of the job.

20:06.816 --> 20:08.649
And now I'm asking that
I go back to work

20:08.749 --> 20:10.282
to provide for my family.

20:27.248 --> 20:29.949
Do you feel a desire
to seek retribution?

20:31.782 --> 20:34.015
The only desire I feel...

20:35.316 --> 20:38.916
Is to complete a career
I've dedicated 25 years to.

20:39.015 --> 20:42.215
And retire.
On my terms.

20:42.316 --> 20:44.282
Once I've received my pension.

21:28.582 --> 21:30.782
<i>♪ I know some niggas
that I've never seen ♪</i>

21:30.882 --> 21:33.148

21:45.948 --> 21:47.316
How do you get there?

21:47.948 --> 21:48.948
Stairs through here.

21:57.382 --> 22:00.416
<i>♪ I'm on ten like,

22:22.449 --> 22:24.382
Well, well, well, Bunny.

22:25.482 --> 22:28.849
How long do ya think it'll take
before PD's got a drone up here?

22:28.948 --> 22:31.148
Filming you sell junk
on your rooftop.

22:32.048 --> 22:33.582
I ain't selling shit from here.

22:34.015 --> 22:35.549
You must just like
this beautiful view.

22:35.649 --> 22:38.015
I'm here so no
mo'fucker hit me in a drive-by.

22:38.316 --> 22:39.616
Anyone drive-by on my ass,

22:39.716 --> 22:41.349
they're gonna need a fuckin'
helicopter or some shit.

22:41.449 --> 22:42.849
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

22:42.948 --> 22:43.981
Hey.

22:44.081 --> 22:45.616
Didn't know it was your shop.

22:46.081 --> 22:47.782
Some Blood called in a tip.

22:49.816 --> 22:51.849
Man, they rat-ass motherfuckers.

22:51.948 --> 22:54.316
You wait 'til you see the tip
I call in on their ass.

22:54.316 --> 22:56.616
I put the whole fuckin' police
in they goddamn Alamo,

22:56.716 --> 22:58.148
I swear on God.

22:58.316 --> 23:00.948
Bunny, I'm here to put a lid
on this fuckin' thing.

23:01.048 --> 23:02.782
Ain't no leaders on
the inside, Mike.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.316
Yeah, yeah.

23:04.416 --> 23:06.449
Not one mo'fucker shot calling
in the whole goddamn camp.

23:08.048 --> 23:10.181
Why don't you pick new leaders?

23:10.316 --> 23:12.749
There ain't no new leaders
to pick, Mike.

23:14.015 --> 23:16.449
Fucking S.W.A.T., soldiers,
and the whole goddamn US Army

23:16.549 --> 23:18.981
came in there,
damn near killed everybody.

23:19.582 --> 23:22.316
Everybody else that's left
is either too green

23:22.316 --> 23:25.716
or a sorry-ass motherfucker
aint nobody want running shit.

23:28.682 --> 23:31.316
And you know how leaders
rise, right?

23:32.349 --> 23:33.948
Somebody gon' bag a trophy.

23:34.048 --> 23:35.215
They're gonna start
badge huntin', Mike.

23:35.316 --> 23:36.516
Let me tell you
somethin' right now.

23:36.616 --> 23:38.349
One badge hits
the fuckin' ground,

23:38.449 --> 23:40.316
there'll be tanks runnin'
up and down the street.

23:40.316 --> 23:41.749
You know it.
Okay?

23:41.848 --> 23:43.081
And the fuckin' prison guards?

23:43.482 --> 23:45.915
You know the deal.
The outside run for the inside.

23:46.549 --> 23:48.716
Now, we can't get no messages
in or out.

23:48.816 --> 23:51.682
We can't get the product in,
we can't get no money out!

23:51.782 --> 23:53.516
It's them fuckin' guards...

23:53.616 --> 23:55.881
They's chokin' us to death, Mike.

23:57.316 --> 23:59.482
Well, the only way it'll get
better, Bunny,

23:59.582 --> 24:02.881
is if the whole world gets
fucking quiet.

24:03.749 --> 24:06.316
Real quiet, real fast.

24:07.015 --> 24:08.115
Friend to friend...

24:08.682 --> 24:11.682
I wouldn't be cooking,
and I wouldn't be moving.

24:12.416 --> 24:14.682
You know how many of us
they shot...

24:15.316 --> 24:16.649
Like dogs...

24:16.981 --> 24:18.081
In that prison?

24:18.181 --> 24:20.482
They killed 33 guards, Bunny.

24:20.815 --> 24:22.316
And then they raped the rest
of 'em with

24:22.316 --> 24:23.716
their own fucking Billy clubs.

24:23.815 --> 24:26.316
These guards, they are fuckin'
thirsty for round two.

24:26.316 --> 24:28.316
They're just waiting for you
to do something.

24:29.981 --> 24:32.749
Well, you was inside.
You know how it go.

24:33.316 --> 24:35.482
All you got is your pride,
and right now...

24:35.848 --> 24:37.382
They ain't even got that.

24:38.781 --> 24:41.349
They cannot be the ones to
blink, Mike.

24:41.815 --> 24:43.781
I think they've already
fuckin' blinked.

24:44.416 --> 24:45.582
Bunny.
Right?

24:45.682 --> 24:46.749
That's why they're sweating
their asses off

24:46.848 --> 24:48.349
in fucking tents.

24:48.449 --> 24:49.749
They got no phones.

24:50.148 --> 24:51.781
They got no drugs,
they got no money,

24:51.881 --> 24:53.316
they got no fuckin' yard.

24:55.115 --> 24:56.716
Hell, they won't even get
any fuckin' food,

24:56.815 --> 24:57.815
if they're not careful.

24:58.449 --> 25:00.015
Sortin' out your leaders
is gonna be one thing.

25:00.115 --> 25:04.081
But using this downtime
to steal turf, motherfucker...

25:04.582 --> 25:06.549
It's a good way to get
S.W.A.T. in your living room.

25:06.649 --> 25:08.048
Okay?
Just lettin' you know.

25:08.148 --> 25:09.215
Don't look at me, bruh.

25:09.316 --> 25:10.416
I'm the one hidin' out
on the roof

25:10.516 --> 25:12.048
from all of this shit, aight?

25:12.148 --> 25:13.516
I remember this rooftop bein'

25:13.616 --> 25:16.115
Blood turf just
one fuckin' week ago.

25:16.215 --> 25:18.449
And three years ago,
this shit was mine!

25:19.449 --> 25:21.981
I ain't take shit, Mike!
I just took it back!

25:22.416 --> 25:24.682
Jehovah's Witness lookin' ass
mo'fucker.

25:49.948 --> 25:52.081
You know exactly what
I'm fuckin' sayin'.

25:54.748 --> 25:56.582
Hey, Sarah, can I get a coffee?
Please?

25:56.682 --> 25:58.181
There he is.
Mikey, how are ya?

25:58.316 --> 25:59.582
- Yeah, all right.
- Mike.

25:59.682 --> 26:00.449
All right, boys.

26:00.549 --> 26:01.616
What's goin' on?

26:01.715 --> 26:02.748
Thank you.

26:04.215 --> 26:05.649
Okay.
How's the parking lot?

26:05.748 --> 26:07.649
They're walkin' around
like fuckin' zombies

26:07.748 --> 26:09.316
'cause it's so fuckin' hot.

26:09.582 --> 26:11.382
Half of 'em can't even
get off their cots

26:11.482 --> 26:13.181
'cause they're detoxin' so bad.

26:13.316 --> 26:15.316
We should've put 'em
in tents years ago.

26:15.316 --> 26:17.148
Got anybody lined up to
run that shit?

26:17.316 --> 26:19.115
Mexicans got it figured,
I think.

26:19.616 --> 26:20.948
Whites lost it two ways:

26:21.048 --> 26:22.316
They lost Duke on the outside,

26:22.416 --> 26:24.081
they lost their command
on the inside,

26:24.181 --> 26:25.482
they're a fucking mess.

26:25.582 --> 26:27.649
Bloods and Crips have been
hammerin' at each other,

26:27.748 --> 26:29.915
but they've got no weapons
now, so...

26:30.215 --> 26:32.416
Just a bunch of
schoolyard brawls.

26:33.316 --> 26:35.048
Ragin' out here pretty good
though, huh?

26:35.148 --> 26:36.848
It's like fuckin' Fallujah
out here.

26:36.948 --> 26:39.115
We can't hit their cook houses
while this plays out.

26:39.215 --> 26:40.582
Okay?

26:40.681 --> 26:42.316
But hittin' their cook houses
is my fuckin' job.

26:42.316 --> 26:45.181
Well, we need Crips in control.
Okay?

26:45.316 --> 26:46.516
'Cause Bunny's the only one
who has any

26:46.616 --> 26:47.715
fuckin' common sense or vision,

26:47.815 --> 26:50.181
we can't just make
him weaker, all right?

26:50.316 --> 26:52.215
I mean, they're talkin' about
trophy hunting, for God's sakes.

26:52.316 --> 26:53.549
Do they want
another fuckin' war?

26:53.648 --> 26:55.416
They didn't learn a Goddamn
thing from the last one?

26:55.516 --> 26:57.382
What we need to do is just lock
that Commons down...

26:57.482 --> 26:59.215
- Hundred percent.
- And like, sweep them...

27:00.981 --> 27:02.349
Will you all just fuckin'
listen to me?

27:02.449 --> 27:04.015
Fuck!
Okay?

27:04.115 --> 27:05.915
They're talkin' to the fuckin'
gangs, here.

27:06.015 --> 27:08.382
We need a pecking order inside, gentlemen.

27:08.482 --> 27:10.549
So we have control on
the outside.

27:10.648 --> 27:12.648
I have no one to negotiate with.

27:12.748 --> 27:14.181
There's no fucking order!

27:14.316 --> 27:15.915
When there's no order,
they do drive-bys

27:16.015 --> 27:17.181
by the fuckin' schools,

27:17.316 --> 27:18.516
and every cop car
that passes by.

27:18.615 --> 27:19.815
We don't need that!

27:19.915 --> 27:20.981
I gotta piss now.

27:25.316 --> 27:26.516
What the fuck you want us to do?

27:26.615 --> 27:28.449
Just double your presence
on the street,

27:28.549 --> 27:30.416
and just pull back just
a little.

27:30.516 --> 27:31.881
All right?
Just--

27:31.981 --> 27:34.015
Give 'em some time
to work this shit out.

27:34.115 --> 27:35.048
Can you do that?

27:35.148 --> 27:36.115
- Fuck yeah.
- Great.

27:36.215 --> 27:37.349
Where's Ad Seg?

27:37.449 --> 27:38.648
There ain't one.

27:38.748 --> 27:39.681
Really?

27:39.781 --> 27:41.848
We threw all the animals in together.

27:42.316 --> 27:43.549
Milo's in general pop?

27:43.648 --> 27:45.416
- Milo Sunter?
- Yeah.

27:45.516 --> 27:47.148
I don't know, I think
that piece of shit's dead.

27:47.316 --> 27:49.015
He's not on our fuckin'
DOA list.

27:50.048 --> 27:51.048
Are your sure?

27:51.148 --> 27:52.181
You think I miss that shit?

27:52.615 --> 27:54.915
Look, Mike, they're still tryin'
to ID bodies.

27:55.015 --> 27:56.081
There's like, 300 of 'em.

27:56.181 --> 27:57.881
How do you not have ID
on all your prisoners?

27:57.981 --> 28:00.316
Because they burned
the medical records,

28:00.416 --> 28:01.648
- the dental files.
- Ah, Jesus...

28:01.748 --> 28:03.781
They destroyed the computers,
the servers.

28:03.881 --> 28:06.115
They're fingerprinting cadavers.

28:08.148 --> 28:09.316
It's a fuckin' disaster.

28:09.316 --> 28:10.449
All right, I gotta go.

28:10.549 --> 28:11.615
- All right.
- See you, boys.

28:11.715 --> 28:13.115
See you, Mike.

28:17.748 --> 28:18.981
Hey, Mike.

28:19.081 --> 28:20.081
I gotta go, Stevie.

28:20.181 --> 28:21.449
I gotta talk to you
real quick.

28:21.548 --> 28:22.615
Yeah, you had your window.

28:23.081 --> 28:24.948
Guess who the last person was
Duke talked to

28:25.048 --> 28:26.048
before he got hit.

28:27.015 --> 28:28.148
I give up.

28:28.548 --> 28:29.715
It was you.

28:31.548 --> 28:32.981
So, is there anything
you wanna tell me?

28:35.848 --> 28:37.316
You got his phone in evidence?

28:37.316 --> 28:39.548
No, his phone is fucking gone.

28:40.349 --> 28:43.081
But everything on his phone is
in some data room somewhere.

28:43.181 --> 28:44.382
So look, man, if...

28:44.482 --> 28:45.848
If I've gotta sweep up...

28:46.615 --> 28:48.548
I gotta know what fucking
got broke.

28:52.781 --> 28:53.748
Yeah.

28:56.548 --> 28:58.015
Everything's broke.

29:00.715 --> 29:01.915
Sweep everything.

29:20.981 --> 29:22.948
We got him behind
the port o' johns.

29:24.215 --> 29:25.581
No cameras.

29:26.715 --> 29:27.948
Hey, Kareem...

29:29.115 --> 29:30.148
Don't fuckin' shoot.

29:41.615 --> 29:43.449
Get the fuck up!

30:46.349 --> 30:48.215
He's gonna fuckin' kill him.

30:48.316 --> 30:49.915
Who gives a shit?

30:51.548 --> 30:53.248
We'll blame the Mexicans.

31:03.181 --> 31:04.781
All right,
what is it now?

31:04.881 --> 31:06.382
<i>Are you gonna make it
into the office today?</i>

31:06.481 --> 31:07.848
I don't know.

31:07.948 --> 31:09.415
I need to know soon.
We have a packed house.

31:09.515 --> 31:10.815
<i>Anyone I need to see?</i>

31:10.915 --> 31:13.615
I won't know that
until you get here, Mike.

31:13.948 --> 31:14.881
Oh...

31:15.615 --> 31:17.481
You got a call from
a Wendy Morris,

31:17.581 --> 31:19.115
from the Warwick Group?

31:19.215 --> 31:20.448
Don't know her.

31:20.548 --> 31:22.316
<i>I looked them up,
they're multinational.</i>

31:22.316 --> 31:24.015
She's their private prison rep.

31:24.115 --> 31:27.015
<i>Well, she calls back,
tell her to fuck off.</i>

31:27.715 --> 31:29.448
Yeah, I'm not gonna
say that, Mike.

31:29.781 --> 31:31.148
Fine, say it your way.

31:31.316 --> 31:33.349
Just make sure she hears
the "fuck off" part.

31:40.748 --> 31:41.681
What's up?

31:41.781 --> 31:43.048
<i>Hey, we need to speak.</i>

31:43.581 --> 31:44.881
All right. Speak.

31:44.981 --> 31:46.648
Not on the phone.
Where are you?

31:47.015 --> 31:48.348
<i>At the coroner's.</i>

31:48.648 --> 31:50.515
All right, I'll be there in...

31:50.748 --> 31:52.748
15 minutes.
Don't leave.

31:53.081 --> 31:54.548
<i>I'm here 14 hours
a day, Mike.</i>

31:54.648 --> 31:56.515
Nothing would please me more
than leaving.

31:56.615 --> 31:57.748
Well, don't leave...

31:57.848 --> 31:59.316
I'll be right there.

32:34.815 --> 32:36.315
You all right?

32:36.315 --> 32:37.815
Been better.

32:40.015 --> 32:41.315
Sheesh.

32:42.381 --> 32:43.715
You have a final count?

32:44.315 --> 32:46.548
We're still finding bodies
in nooks and crannies,

32:46.648 --> 32:48.115
sublevel's a maze.

32:48.415 --> 32:49.415
<i>Fuck.</i>

32:50.381 --> 32:52.548
IA's gonna be up
your S.W.A.T. buddy's ass,

32:52.648 --> 32:53.815
by the way.

32:54.981 --> 32:56.881
Yeah, well,
they saved my brother, so...

32:56.981 --> 32:58.915
And dumped nearly half
the guys in here.

32:59.015 --> 33:00.481
Whole lotta shootin',
no one shootin' back.

33:00.581 --> 33:03.481
They left .223 caliber shells
like fucking breadcrumbs, Mike.

33:03.581 --> 33:05.148
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

33:06.881 --> 33:08.048
How's Kyle?

33:11.648 --> 33:13.015
Took a job upstate.

33:13.715 --> 33:14.781
Look...

33:15.115 --> 33:17.315
Milo isn't listed on
the inmate roster.

33:17.548 --> 33:18.748
I know.

33:19.881 --> 33:21.615
Then why didn't you
fuckin' tell me?

33:21.881 --> 33:23.015
I thought you knew.

33:23.115 --> 33:24.348
You know fuckin' everything
else, Mike.

33:27.048 --> 33:28.215
How many left to DNA?

33:28.315 --> 33:29.815
It's a cluster of
sex offenders,

33:29.915 --> 33:32.315
of inmates tortured,
then torched alive.

33:33.948 --> 33:34.815
<i>Fuck.</i>

33:34.915 --> 33:36.581
Nobody's torching Milo!

33:40.215 --> 33:41.415
Mike!

33:42.415 --> 33:43.781
Mike!

33:43.881 --> 33:48.748
We've got 197 dead,
and 724 criminal investigations.

33:48.848 --> 33:51.315
It is a jurisdictional clusterfuck.

33:53.681 --> 33:54.715
He got out.

33:54.815 --> 33:56.381
I don't see how that's possible.

33:56.481 --> 33:58.048
He didn't fall in with
the fuckin' child molesters.

33:58.148 --> 34:00.081
Okay, and he used every gang
in that prison.

34:00.315 --> 34:01.781
How, Mike?
What did, what did he do?

34:01.881 --> 34:03.381
What, did he just walk out
the front gate?

34:03.481 --> 34:04.681
Maybe!

34:04.781 --> 34:06.214
Have you got inventory
on guard uniforms?

34:06.315 --> 34:08.715
We do not have inventory on
guard uniforms.

34:08.815 --> 34:10.148
It's a disaster.

34:10.315 --> 34:11.115
We are blind.

34:11.214 --> 34:12.315
You're going to have to issue

34:12.415 --> 34:14.415
the escaped inmate alert,
you know that?

34:14.515 --> 34:15.715
- Issue an alert.
- Yeah!

34:15.815 --> 34:16.715
For the most notorious criminal...

34:16.815 --> 34:17.848
- Yeah!
- In Michigan?

34:17.948 --> 34:19.581
Has maybe escaped?

34:20.181 --> 34:21.681
You saw all the bodies.

34:22.115 --> 34:23.315
I saw all the bodies?

34:23.415 --> 34:24.315
Mm-hm.

34:24.415 --> 34:26.015
And did you see him?

34:27.148 --> 34:29.148
He is not one of the bodies
that we can identify.

34:29.315 --> 34:31.781
You see what the fuck
I'm saying?

34:31.881 --> 34:34.581
He got the fuck out, Evelyn.

34:37.048 --> 34:38.648
And the disaster grows...

34:38.748 --> 34:40.681
This is a disaster, Evelyn!

34:40.781 --> 34:42.515
Everything else
is fuckin' shrapnel!

35:15.681 --> 35:16.648
Hey.

35:16.748 --> 35:18.048
Hey.

35:18.748 --> 35:19.915
Where'd you get that swimsuit?

35:20.015 --> 35:21.615
I found it on the boat.

35:21.715 --> 35:23.348
We gotta go, okay?

35:23.981 --> 35:25.481
Okay?
You gotta leave.

35:25.581 --> 35:26.881
What happened?

35:29.180 --> 35:30.515
Mike!

35:31.147 --> 35:32.348
We gotta leave.

36:30.080 --> 36:31.448
Homing pigeon.

36:32.681 --> 36:34.581
Sending a message
to my son.

36:35.781 --> 36:36.681
Where's your son?

36:37.048 --> 36:38.548
He lives up in Detroit.

36:39.481 --> 36:40.648
That's far.

36:41.114 --> 36:43.448
Nah, far is when he lived
in Cleveland.

36:47.948 --> 36:49.381
How often do you
send him a message?

36:49.781 --> 36:53.748
Every Wednesday I send him one,
and he sends me one back.

36:53.848 --> 36:55.180
Same day?

36:55.315 --> 36:57.448
The pigeon takes about
four hours, round trip.

36:58.114 --> 36:59.715
Why don't you just
call him?

36:59.815 --> 37:02.114
How many calls
do you miss a day?

37:02.748 --> 37:03.615
How many texts?

37:04.214 --> 37:05.915
I can't count how many
I've missed.

37:06.348 --> 37:08.448
But I ain't never missed
a pigeon.

37:17.014 --> 37:18.515
You take it easy, now.

37:18.615 --> 37:19.715
Have a good day.

37:25.348 --> 37:26.615
You got everything worked out?

37:26.981 --> 37:28.481
We gotta safe house her here
for a week

37:28.581 --> 37:30.481
while we line out an ID
and a location.

37:30.848 --> 37:31.881
Where's the location?

37:32.147 --> 37:33.615
Scottsdale or Denver.

37:33.715 --> 37:36.315
Can we do Denver?
She'll melt in the desert.

37:36.315 --> 37:38.381
Computer picks it, we don't have
anything to do with it.

37:38.481 --> 37:40.481
Well, just keep pressin'
that fuckin' enter button

37:40.581 --> 37:41.615
until it says Denver.

37:42.448 --> 37:43.715
We'll give it our best shot.

37:43.981 --> 37:45.415
Okay, I'll follow you.

37:45.848 --> 37:46.848
Mike...

37:47.581 --> 37:49.147
You can't know where
we're goin'.

37:49.515 --> 37:51.315
For all we know,
you were followed here.

37:52.481 --> 37:54.615
If I was followed, then they
can fuckin' follow you.

37:54.715 --> 37:55.715
We can't do it.

37:56.715 --> 37:58.881
Look, I don't think she's gonna
go if I don't take her.

37:58.980 --> 38:00.315
Then she doesn't do it.

38:03.915 --> 38:06.014
Fuck.
Give me a minute.

38:14.848 --> 38:15.815
Ready?

38:19.180 --> 38:20.415
I don't wanna go.

38:23.515 --> 38:24.581
<i>Okay.</i>

38:26.114 --> 38:28.315
What are you gonna do, Iris?

38:29.315 --> 38:31.315
They're gonna give you
a new identity.

38:31.581 --> 38:33.615
You get a house, you get a car.

38:33.947 --> 38:35.615
They'll help you get
a fucking job.

38:36.515 --> 38:37.581
All right?

38:38.047 --> 38:39.315
Go to school.

38:39.615 --> 38:40.681
Start a new life.

38:41.881 --> 38:43.915
But you decide the course of it.

38:44.348 --> 38:46.848
Well, there's schools here.

38:46.947 --> 38:48.315
And there's houses here...

38:48.315 --> 38:50.481
The schools here are to teach
you to get the fuck out.

38:50.581 --> 38:53.348
The houses are for people
who can't.

38:54.415 --> 38:57.315
But I can't call you,
and you can't visit me.

38:58.748 --> 38:59.748
No.

39:00.315 --> 39:01.815
No, no.

39:01.914 --> 39:03.315
You can't, and I can't, either.

39:03.315 --> 39:04.581
That's how it works.

39:11.715 --> 39:13.180
Man.

39:15.815 --> 39:16.848
Why the boat?

39:17.980 --> 39:19.080
Why the boat, Mike?

39:19.415 --> 39:21.548
Why do somethin' so nice?

39:27.980 --> 39:29.781
I'll tell you why.

39:30.415 --> 39:31.815
The boat was...

39:31.914 --> 39:33.180
The boat was for you.

39:33.848 --> 39:34.815
It wasn't for me.

39:35.448 --> 39:37.348
To make you feel better
about all this.

39:39.180 --> 39:40.581
- I didn't do it for me...
- Mm-hm, okay.

39:40.681 --> 39:41.581
And you know it.

39:41.681 --> 39:43.581
It was to give you
a second chance.

39:43.947 --> 39:45.180
And you're fuckin' welcome.

40:15.615 --> 40:16.515
Hi.

40:16.615 --> 40:17.415
Hello.

40:17.515 --> 40:19.381
A bottle of red label, please?

40:25.815 --> 40:27.147
How much is that?

40:27.247 --> 40:28.715
It's 35.

40:28.947 --> 40:31.381
Okay.
Here's 40.

40:37.980 --> 40:39.315
Thank you.

40:58.281 --> 41:00.315
No!
Goddamn it!

41:00.947 --> 41:01.847
Give it up!

41:01.947 --> 41:03.315
No!

41:06.080 --> 41:07.847
Give it fucking up,
bitch!

41:11.214 --> 41:13.214
Take it!

41:13.315 --> 41:14.814
Take the cash!

41:17.947 --> 41:19.481
Just take the cash!

41:57.747 --> 41:58.980
Ah, fuck!

41:59.080 --> 42:00.047
What?

42:00.147 --> 42:01.348
They spotted us!

42:01.448 --> 42:02.548
How do you know?

42:02.648 --> 42:04.080
Because they're
turning around!

42:05.681 --> 42:08.780
Air 624, we are in pursuit.
Coordinates to follow.

42:11.914 --> 42:14.214
<i>B82, we have visual on them.</i>

42:20.147 --> 42:21.515
What are you doin'?

42:21.615 --> 42:22.947
What the fuck does it look like
I'm doin'?

42:23.047 --> 42:24.947
They're Canadians!
They don't have any guns!

42:25.047 --> 42:27.814
They're smugglers, all smugglers
have fuckin' guns.

42:27.914 --> 42:29.714
Whatever you say,
John Wayne.

42:29.814 --> 42:30.747
Siren.

42:31.180 --> 42:32.448
Which one's the siren?

42:32.548 --> 42:33.814
The crank.

42:34.415 --> 42:36.214
The big fucking crank
right next to you!

42:36.315 --> 42:38.315
Sorry, I missed the
fucking siren day

42:38.415 --> 42:39.648
at boating school!

42:48.615 --> 42:49.980
<i>Michigan State Police.</i>

42:50.080 --> 42:52.415
<i>Halt your vessel,
or we will disable it.</i>

42:52.515 --> 42:55.014
Halt your vessel,
or we will disable it!

42:55.114 --> 42:56.114
How are you gonna disable it?

42:56.214 --> 42:57.381
Ah, it's bullshit.

42:57.481 --> 42:58.648
But they must think
we have torpedoes,

42:58.747 --> 43:00.315
'cause it works every time.

43:19.315 --> 43:20.847
Get down.
Get down from there.

43:20.947 --> 43:23.080
Why you fuckers
won't just pay the tariff?

43:23.180 --> 43:24.980
Come on, show me how much
you got.

43:25.080 --> 43:26.515
Get the fuck down!

43:28.348 --> 43:30.080
Get your fuckin' hands where
I can see 'em.

43:35.448 --> 43:38.014
Back the fuck up.
Back the fuck up!

43:48.515 --> 43:50.147
- It's maple syrup!
- Yep.

43:50.315 --> 43:52.114
Yeah, what are you hiding in it?

43:52.214 --> 43:53.315
What do you mean?

43:53.315 --> 43:54.614
What kind of drugs
are they hiding?!

43:54.714 --> 43:55.381
Drugs?!

43:55.481 --> 43:56.814
Shut the fuck up!

43:56.914 --> 43:58.947
They're not hiding drugs,
they're just jumpin' the tariff!

43:59.448 --> 44:00.847
Come on, you know the drill.

44:00.947 --> 44:02.747
You gotta pay the fine
and the tariff right now...

44:02.847 --> 44:04.114
- Or follow us in.
- Oh my God.

44:04.214 --> 44:06.114
We confiscate it
and hand it over to customs,

44:06.214 --> 44:07.448
and you pay the fine to them.

44:07.548 --> 44:09.080
Checkbooks in my quarters.

44:09.448 --> 44:11.080
Great, we take fuckin' checks!

44:11.614 --> 44:13.114
Hey, can I talk to you for
a fuckin' second?!

44:13.214 --> 44:16.180
You have the tactical awareness
of a fucking eight-year-old!

44:16.747 --> 44:17.980
You didn't tell me we were
chasin' maple syrup,

44:18.080 --> 44:19.847
I thought there was fucking
drugs on this boat!

44:19.947 --> 44:21.614
The drugs go the other way, dipshit.

44:21.980 --> 44:24.680
And we let 'em, 'cause I got
a fuckin' family!

44:24.780 --> 44:26.714
And I don't tell you shit
'cause you're a rookie.

44:26.814 --> 44:27.980
Don't give me
that "rookie" shit!

44:28.080 --> 44:30.180
I've been Kingstown PD
for 12 years.

44:30.315 --> 44:31.914
Yeah, well, you're
a rookie to me.

44:32.014 --> 44:33.114
You know what?

44:33.214 --> 44:34.847
You're lucky there were no
drugs on this boat,

44:34.947 --> 44:37.814
you left three guys on deck
and you didn't even frisk 'em.

44:38.315 --> 44:40.548
Dumb!
Motherfucker!

44:41.381 --> 44:42.515
Christ.

44:53.548 --> 44:55.047
Can I get one of those?

45:16.415 --> 45:18.080
Is your tooth all right?

45:19.381 --> 45:20.315
Yo.

45:20.614 --> 45:22.381
Patrol caught him
a few blocks up.

45:23.180 --> 45:25.080
They're gonna charge him with
assault and armed robbery.

45:25.747 --> 45:27.947
But he wasn't armed,
wasn't armed.

45:28.047 --> 45:30.214
Well, the arresting officer,
they found a knife on him.

45:30.315 --> 45:31.614
He didn't use a knife, Ian.

45:31.714 --> 45:33.547
No, not this time, Mariam,
but next time...

45:33.647 --> 45:35.780
Look.
Now look, Mariam.

45:36.080 --> 45:38.014
Are you okay to identify
this guy?

45:38.114 --> 45:39.415
Yeah, what's his name?

45:39.514 --> 45:40.547
Marco Diaz.

45:40.647 --> 45:42.114
Okay, I wanna talk to him.

45:46.814 --> 45:48.481
Oh my God,
what happened?

45:48.580 --> 45:50.014
He resisted.

45:56.481 --> 45:58.214
- I'm not pressing charges.
- Mariam...

45:58.315 --> 46:00.381
He's got a juvenile record
the size of a phone book.

46:00.481 --> 46:01.714
What he did to you,

46:01.814 --> 46:03.547
he just fast-tracked himself to adulthood.

46:03.647 --> 46:06.348
You're fast-tracking him!
You are, Ian!

46:07.780 --> 46:09.514
All right, look, I didn't say
anything to Mike.

46:09.614 --> 46:10.780
- I didn't say anything to Kyle.
- Don't!

46:10.880 --> 46:12.680
But they will not be
okay with this.

46:12.780 --> 46:14.580
Stevie's not okay with
this kid runnin' the street,

46:14.680 --> 46:16.381
- I'm not okay with it.
- I'm okay with it!

46:16.480 --> 46:17.814
Let him go, Stevie.

46:17.914 --> 46:19.714
Mariam, listen to me.

46:21.847 --> 46:23.480
<i>This coulda been so much worse.</i>

46:24.080 --> 46:25.814
<i>So much worse,
he coulda killed ya.</i>

46:27.147 --> 46:28.114
Yeah.

46:34.315 --> 46:35.415
<i>Yes, ma'am.</i>

46:41.580 --> 46:43.415
He's gonna kill somebody.

46:43.780 --> 46:46.348
No.
Your gang'll kill him, first.

46:57.147 --> 46:59.147
How many hours left
to identify him?

46:59.315 --> 47:00.315
Another one.

47:00.747 --> 47:01.914
Great.

47:02.014 --> 47:03.180
They're still finding bodies
in the prison,

47:03.315 --> 47:05.514
but there are only 12
without a tag.

47:06.180 --> 47:10.014
We can rule four out by size,
five out by ethnicity.

47:10.614 --> 47:12.880
So, there's your odds.

47:14.147 --> 47:16.880
Three that could be a match,
or maybe he's still on a roll.

47:17.880 --> 47:19.414
You talkin' about Milo?

47:20.714 --> 47:22.114
I wouldn't get too worked up.

47:22.214 --> 47:25.114
If he's alive, he's probably
still hiding beneath the prison.

47:25.847 --> 47:26.814
Is that why I'm here?

47:26.914 --> 47:28.414
Of course that's
why you're here.

47:28.514 --> 47:29.914
Mike didn't tell you this?

47:30.947 --> 47:32.014
What a fuckin' guy, huh?

47:32.114 --> 47:34.214
Whoa, whoa.
Where you goin'?

47:34.315 --> 47:35.980
For a walk.

47:37.480 --> 47:39.580
I wanna go for a walk.

47:40.514 --> 47:43.714
- Let's have a seat...
- Get your fucking hands off me!

47:47.547 --> 47:49.180
You said this was voluntary, right?

47:49.747 --> 47:51.414
This is voluntary, yes.

47:51.514 --> 47:54.947
So, I wanna go for a walk. Alone.

47:55.414 --> 47:57.380
We can't protect you if
we're not with you.

47:58.980 --> 48:01.480
There were three of you
the last time that he took me.

48:01.980 --> 48:04.147
I don't think you can
protect me at all.

49:22.980 --> 49:24.214
Rebecca?

49:24.314 --> 49:25.314
Yeah?

49:29.580 --> 49:30.514
What the fuck?

49:32.480 --> 49:33.480
Thought we were packed?

49:34.314 --> 49:35.347
We were.

49:36.347 --> 49:37.314
Okay, well...

49:37.414 --> 49:39.314
Why don't you get the fuck
outta here?

49:39.314 --> 49:40.214
Go home.

49:40.314 --> 49:41.147
Thank you.

49:41.314 --> 49:42.314
Yeah.

49:42.780 --> 49:43.980
All right.

49:44.414 --> 49:46.347
Just lock up when you leave,
all right?

49:46.614 --> 49:47.580
Goodnight.

49:47.880 --> 49:48.847
Thank you.

49:48.947 --> 49:50.414
You're welcome.

50:07.080 --> 50:09.014
Rebecca, just lock up
and leave...

50:14.847 --> 50:16.047
Is it true?

50:17.814 --> 50:19.114
Milo out?

50:35.347 --> 50:36.447
Is Milo out?

50:41.347 --> 50:42.380
I don't know.

50:47.714 --> 50:49.380
What does your heart tell you?

50:52.380 --> 50:54.947
I try not to listen
to my heart, Iris.

50:57.514 --> 50:59.213
What does it tell you, Mike?

51:07.414 --> 51:09.179
It tells me it's true.

51:37.380 --> 51:38.847
You ever see
anything like this before?

51:38.947 --> 51:40.114
Not like this.

51:40.213 --> 51:41.213
It's a fucking massacre
under your flag!

51:41.314 --> 51:44.480
No, not my flag.
No, I did not call that.

51:44.580 --> 51:45.914
Let me go.
Let me go, Mike!

51:46.014 --> 51:47.480
I can't have her here.

51:47.580 --> 51:49.880
I cannot leave her alone.

51:49.980 --> 51:51.314
<i>Somebody's fucking cooking
something up.</i>

51:51.314 --> 51:52.380
<i>This town's gonna
get locked down.</i>

51:52.480 --> 51:54.146
We need some order
on the inside, cuz.

51:54.314 --> 51:56.514
This only goes one way
until it stops.
