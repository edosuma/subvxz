WEBVTT

00:16.929 --> 00:18.279
Kill my sister.

00:20.542 --> 00:22.544
Grace is fine.
That'll change real quick

00:22.587 --> 00:24.111
if anything happens
to my sister.

00:24.154 --> 00:25.721
They're all
Virginia's outcasts.

00:25.764 --> 00:28.724
People she was gonna kill.
We're trying to bring her down.

00:28.767 --> 00:30.117
Oh, my God.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.032
You killed Cameron.

00:32.075 --> 00:33.163
Virginia was
covering for you!

00:37.907 --> 00:40.997
John! John!

01:06.196 --> 01:07.980
<i>Morgan?</i>

01:10.853 --> 01:12.507
<i>Morgan!</i>

01:17.599 --> 01:19.688
<i>Where is my sister?</i>

01:22.821 --> 01:25.041
<i>Put her on.</i>

01:25.085 --> 01:26.738
<i>I want to hear her voice.</i>

01:29.611 --> 01:33.180
<i>Morgan. Morgan!</i>

01:33.223 --> 01:34.790
<i>Listen to me.</i>

01:34.833 --> 01:36.531
<i>If you're thinking of
doing something stupid,</i>

01:36.574 --> 01:38.054
<i>let me remind you...</i>

01:38.098 --> 01:41.710
<i>I have</i> all <i>of your people.</i>

02:43.293 --> 02:45.600
<i>Morgan.</i>

02:45.643 --> 02:52.302
<i>Morgan!</i>

02:53.738 --> 02:56.741
Put it down.

02:56.785 --> 02:59.831
I said put it down.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.964
Unless you wanna
join him.

03:02.007 --> 03:04.401
The hell's
going on here?

03:08.666 --> 03:10.668
She took it off the body.

03:12.627 --> 03:14.716
Something tells me it wasn't
for sentimental reasons.

03:14.759 --> 03:17.153
I was giving you a chance
to pay your respects, June.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.938
So you could look for
the person who did this.

03:19.982 --> 03:21.288
Why?
Why what?

03:21.331 --> 03:23.899
Why did your sister
kill my husband?

03:28.033 --> 03:30.558
I saved your life,
Virginia.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.690
Because of what you said about
her -- what she meant to you --

03:32.734 --> 03:34.910
and that is the only reason
you are still breathing

03:34.953 --> 03:36.912
and he isn't.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.133
Answer me.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.485
I don't know why
she did it.

03:48.358 --> 03:50.447
I think you do.

04:35.013 --> 04:37.189
Let's go!

04:37.233 --> 04:39.366
Move it! Move it!

04:52.379 --> 04:54.816
-On the ground!
-Get down!

05:02.563 --> 05:06.044
That's good.
All lined up.

05:06.088 --> 05:07.611
What is this,
Victor?

05:07.655 --> 05:09.831
Just keep calm, and thiswon't escalate any further.

05:09.874 --> 05:11.789
How 'bout I escalate
my foot up your ass?

05:20.450 --> 05:23.801
Morgan's people.
Just like you asked.

05:23.845 --> 05:26.282
-You want the rest of them?
Nah.

05:26.326 --> 05:29.807
We'll keep them as
insurance in case this
batch doesn't work out.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.682
Where's John?

05:37.075 --> 05:38.512
No...

05:40.949 --> 05:43.081
How many more peoplehave to die because of you?!

05:43.125 --> 05:44.561
You tell me.

05:45.475 --> 05:48.043
Wait! Don't!

05:48.086 --> 05:50.262
-Daniel!

05:50.306 --> 05:52.569
Daniel.

05:58.706 --> 06:00.403
Where's he been hiding out?

06:01.752 --> 06:03.363
Where's who been hiding?

06:03.406 --> 06:06.409
Who the hell do you think
I'm talking about?

06:06.453 --> 06:08.193
Morgan Jones.

06:14.504 --> 06:15.810
Well?

06:21.555 --> 06:23.861
He couldn't-a been out there
all on his own.

06:33.218 --> 06:35.830
You know, old-timer?

06:41.139 --> 06:42.489
I don't know anything.

06:42.532 --> 06:45.056
You are always saying that.

06:46.231 --> 06:48.886
-Hey, hey.
-No, he doesn't know anything.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.322
Get up.

07:00.594 --> 07:03.161
You don't have to
know anything.

07:03.205 --> 07:06.164
But somebody does.

07:06.208 --> 07:08.863
Where is he?

07:11.605 --> 07:13.694
Where is Dakota? Huh?

07:18.568 --> 07:20.875
What about you?

07:20.918 --> 07:24.879
Oh, he must have
some hold over you.

07:28.448 --> 07:31.363
What is wrong with
people today, huh?

07:42.984 --> 07:44.986
Okay.

07:45.029 --> 07:47.336
If that's how you want it.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.952
Morgan, I know you're listenin'.

07:57.041 --> 08:00.567
It's very important you hear
what I'm about to say.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.786
You better bring Dakota
back to Lawton right now,

08:02.830 --> 08:06.964
or some very bad things
are about to happen.

08:19.760 --> 08:22.458
You don't start talkin',

08:22.502 --> 08:27.463
I am gonna blow Grace's
"glowing" brains out

08:27.507 --> 08:29.770
in front of everybody here.

08:32.120 --> 08:34.818
You don't believe me?
Ask her yourself.

08:37.255 --> 08:38.605
You won't kill us.

08:38.648 --> 08:41.259
Oh, yes, I will.

08:41.303 --> 08:43.261
Without us,
you have nothing.

08:43.305 --> 08:45.742
Oh. That was very stupid.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.178
Very stupid thing to say.

08:47.222 --> 08:48.789
No! Hey!

08:48.832 --> 08:50.225
No!
No!

08:50.268 --> 08:51.792
-Come on!
-No!

08:56.057 --> 08:57.798
Hello, my sweet baby.

08:57.841 --> 09:01.279
Shame. That baby was gonna be a
bright part of Lawton's future.

09:01.323 --> 09:04.239
It's gonna be just fine.
Just you and me, baby.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.589
I am so sorry.

09:06.633 --> 09:08.069
I'm right here!

09:12.116 --> 09:12.900
Morgan.

09:14.075 --> 09:17.034
Shoot me, and you'll never
see your sister again.

09:19.254 --> 09:22.126
Same goes if anything happens
to any of my friends.

09:22.170 --> 09:24.868
This supposed to
scare me, Morgan?

09:24.912 --> 09:26.870
Ridin' in here,
dolled up like Emile?

09:26.914 --> 09:29.873
-Well, you should be scared.
-Why's that?

09:29.917 --> 09:31.875
'Cause it's over for you.

09:31.919 --> 09:36.140
Everything you are,
everything you were,

09:36.184 --> 09:39.535
everything you had
is gonna get stripped away.

09:39.579 --> 09:41.015
And that's scary.

09:41.058 --> 09:44.366
I know, because
it was over for me once.

09:44.409 --> 09:45.846
Is it over, Morgan?

09:45.889 --> 09:49.676
By my count, you've got one.
I got a bunch.

09:49.719 --> 09:54.376
So how 'bout you tell me
where my sister is,

09:54.419 --> 09:56.508
or I start
goin' down the line,

09:56.552 --> 10:00.077
killing 'em
one by one!

10:03.907 --> 10:05.648
You all need to hear
the truth about Virginia.

10:05.692 --> 10:07.084
There ain't
nothing to tell!

10:07.128 --> 10:09.478
'Cause she's a liar
and she is a hypocrite!

10:09.521 --> 10:11.741
Right, right.'Cause she has rules, right?

10:11.785 --> 10:14.744
That if anything threatens
this future she's building here,

10:14.788 --> 10:16.093
she will destroy it!

10:16.137 --> 10:17.791
-Rules that kept y'all alive!
-That's her rule!

10:17.834 --> 10:19.140
But she doesn't follow
her own rules!

10:19.183 --> 10:20.532
Oh, God damn it.

10:20.576 --> 10:23.535
'Cause Janis didn't kill
Ranger Cameron.

10:23.579 --> 10:25.581
It was Dakota.

10:25.625 --> 10:27.061
-And Virginia covered it up.
-Stop!

10:27.104 --> 10:28.715
That's enough!
That's enough!

10:28.758 --> 10:30.760
She framed Janis,
and then she murdered her.

10:30.804 --> 10:33.197
And it ripped John apart ...told you there
was gonna be a day

10:33.241 --> 10:34.677
when you'd be called
out to the big show....that he thought it was
his fault that Janis died.

10:34.721 --> 10:36.723
This is it.
Start with the old man.

10:36.766 --> 10:39.334
-But the blame for all of this,it lies squarely with her.
-Didn't I protect you?

10:39.377 --> 10:41.205
Didn't I give you
a warm bed to sleep in?!

10:41.249 --> 10:43.207
-John found out the truth...
-What about you, huh?

10:43.251 --> 10:45.253
...about what she was doing
here, about the lie that

10:45.296 --> 10:47.168
she has been feeding you ...dn't I save your kid, huh?

10:47.211 --> 10:49.605
...and he paid for it
with his life!

10:49.649 --> 10:51.215
Don't listen to him!
Don't listen to him!

10:51.259 --> 10:53.740
Shoot the old man, Victor!
Shoot the old man right now!

10:53.783 --> 10:57.047
She sold you on her vision
of the future.

10:57.091 --> 11:00.094
But there is no future
in this place with her.

11:00.137 --> 11:01.138
Never was.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.708
Victor. Please.

11:05.752 --> 11:08.711
He's right. You follow her,
you'll end up dead like Cameron.

11:08.755 --> 11:10.321
The hell are you doing?

11:10.365 --> 11:12.193
Next time,
it'll be one of us.

11:12.236 --> 11:13.803
It'll be you if you don't put
that goddamn gun down right now.

11:13.847 --> 11:15.675
-No.
-The hell are you doing?!

11:15.718 --> 11:18.982
You told me to get ready
for the big show.

11:19.026 --> 11:21.202
I am.

11:21.245 --> 11:23.160
And so are they.

11:23.204 --> 11:26.729
You entrusted me
to build an army.

11:26.773 --> 11:29.950
You should've been careful
about who I'd use it against.

11:38.219 --> 11:40.134
You tell me where
my sister is right now.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.049
You're not calling
the shots anymore.

11:42.092 --> 11:44.225
You're never
gonna see Dakota again.

11:44.268 --> 11:46.357
Put her where
she put Janis.

11:46.401 --> 11:48.664
Victor, no.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.448
We can do this
the easy way...

11:50.492 --> 11:52.189
or we can do this
the hard way.

11:52.233 --> 11:54.104
It's your call, Virginia.

12:05.463 --> 12:07.857
Aah!

12:07.901 --> 12:09.424
Stand down! This is all
that has to happen.

12:09.467 --> 12:10.599
Don't do it.

12:10.642 --> 12:12.775
Unh! Morgan!

12:12.819 --> 12:15.082
Don't anybody move!

12:15.125 --> 12:17.824
-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
-Let her go!

12:17.867 --> 12:19.869
Come any closer,
and I'll shoot!

12:19.913 --> 12:21.697
Get on the horse!
Bring me Dakota!

12:21.741 --> 12:23.786
Daniel. Daniel!

12:25.309 --> 12:26.658
-Get down!
-Pick 'em off!

12:26.702 --> 12:28.660
Everybody get down!

12:42.283 --> 12:45.852
Lucy!

12:45.895 --> 12:48.463
Lucy! Come here! Come.
Come. Come here.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.296
Once they lay him, we'll
hit them from the side!

13:00.257 --> 13:01.432
Aah!

13:05.045 --> 13:06.873
-Get...

13:06.916 --> 13:10.833
Get up! Get up!
Get in there! Go.

13:13.705 --> 13:15.098
There's too many
of 'em, Ginny!

13:15.142 --> 13:17.274
Too many for now.
Take 'em to Southpaw.

13:17.318 --> 13:19.320
Long as we have someone,
we still have leverage.

13:19.363 --> 13:21.322
Ginny --
Go! Go!

13:38.643 --> 13:40.210
Ohh!

13:44.562 --> 13:46.738
Bring 'em back.

13:46.782 --> 13:48.566
Call them back!

13:48.610 --> 13:50.873
You kill me,
you kill Grace and Daniel.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.833
Not to mention
that sweet little baby.

13:53.876 --> 13:55.965
You know what to do,
Morgan.

13:57.662 --> 14:00.665
Even if I say yes,
you wouldn't last long
enough to make it there.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.276
Not on my own.

14:02.319 --> 14:04.495
Hand her over, Morgan!

14:04.539 --> 14:07.150
No! She's got Grace!
And Daniel!

14:07.194 --> 14:09.326
We've got rangers!
We'll find them!

14:09.370 --> 14:12.112
No, they won't. You
better keep me alive
if you want 'em breathin'.

14:12.155 --> 14:15.942
Don't do it, Morgan!
You don't want to regret this!

14:18.640 --> 14:19.902
Shit...

14:19.946 --> 14:21.164
-Morgan?!

14:21.208 --> 14:23.340
-Morgan!
-Get in, get in.

14:23.384 --> 14:25.865
What the hell are you doing?!
Morgan!

14:27.127 --> 14:28.563
We will find you, Morgan!

14:44.013 --> 14:46.407
Ohh! No! No!
Hang tight.

14:46.450 --> 14:49.932
Careful. That's it.

14:56.069 --> 14:58.810
Call them.

15:00.900 --> 15:03.641
Grace and Daniel.
Prove to me they're okay.

15:03.685 --> 15:05.165
And why should I?

15:05.208 --> 15:07.950
Because you're still alive.

15:07.994 --> 15:11.084
I held up my end of the deal.
Now call 'em.

15:17.090 --> 15:19.614
Mountain.

15:19.657 --> 15:21.181
<i>Southpaw. You okay?</i>

15:22.399 --> 15:25.054
Oh, I'm -- I'm fine.
Let Morgan hear 'em.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.885
<i>We're here, Morgan.
We're safe.</i>

15:34.063 --> 15:36.979
I'm in a water tower
close to Grit.

15:39.503 --> 15:41.853
So you know where I am.

15:41.897 --> 15:43.507
I'll check in soon.

15:43.551 --> 15:45.466
<i>Copy that, Virginia.
We're standing by.</i>

15:49.122 --> 15:52.908
I stopped the bleeding,
but the bullet's still in there.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.867
You need medical attention,
otherwise it's gonna kill ya.

16:00.960 --> 16:03.049
Is this where
you've been living?

16:03.092 --> 16:04.441
No.

16:07.488 --> 16:10.230
Oh, it was for Grace.

16:15.539 --> 16:19.543
Well, I took good care of her.
And the baby.

16:19.587 --> 16:22.242
-You should know that.
-That doesn't change anything.

16:22.285 --> 16:27.073
Still wouldn't want that baby
growing up anywhere near you.

16:27.116 --> 16:28.552
You want to kill me,
don't you?

16:28.596 --> 16:30.032
Yeah, but I can't.

16:30.076 --> 16:33.340
Not as long as you got
Daniel and Grace.

16:33.383 --> 16:36.430
It don't look good
for you.

16:36.473 --> 16:38.562
You survived
something worse?

16:38.606 --> 16:40.477
I did, yeah.

16:40.521 --> 16:42.218
But not for the reasons
you think.

16:42.262 --> 16:44.090
And what's that mean?

16:48.137 --> 16:50.705
Finally found out who saved me
that night at the Gulch.

16:50.748 --> 16:52.446
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

16:52.489 --> 16:53.708
Who?

16:53.751 --> 16:54.970
Your sister.

16:55.014 --> 16:59.801
Oh, that is
some bullshit.

16:59.844 --> 17:02.064
There is no way she could've
gotten all the way out there.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.893
But she did. I think
there's a lot about that girl

17:04.936 --> 17:06.199
that you don't know.
Mm-hmm.

17:06.242 --> 17:07.983
And why'd she save you?
'Cause of me?

17:08.027 --> 17:10.812
Yeah. She thought
I'd be able to kill you.

17:10.855 --> 17:12.509
And how do you
know that?

17:17.036 --> 17:19.603
Is that her writing?

17:27.611 --> 17:30.571
God, what did you do
to that child?

17:36.403 --> 17:39.319
Oh, no.

17:39.362 --> 17:41.190
Oh.

17:41.234 --> 17:43.236
I gotta see her.
I gotta see her.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.760
Then you release
Daniel and Grace.

17:45.803 --> 17:48.632
You release 'em --No, no, no.

17:48.676 --> 17:50.982
No, I'm sorry, Morgan,
but I gotta see her first.

17:51.026 --> 17:53.072
-That is not gonna happen.
-Morgan. No, no, please.

17:53.115 --> 17:55.074
What I have to say,
it has to be said in person.

17:55.117 --> 17:57.598
And what do you
have to say?

17:57.641 --> 17:59.339
What? Don't lie to me.
You want me to take you to her.

17:59.382 --> 18:00.818
You tell me what this is.

18:00.862 --> 18:02.994
I can't, I can't, I can't.

18:04.779 --> 18:06.607
What is it?

18:12.787 --> 18:15.833
She --

18:15.877 --> 18:17.792
She's not my sister.

18:23.058 --> 18:24.755
She's my daughter.

18:24.799 --> 18:26.192
She...

18:35.853 --> 18:38.029
Is that the truth?

18:46.386 --> 18:48.170
I was young.

18:48.214 --> 18:50.999
My parents were ashamed.

18:51.042 --> 18:52.870
They --

18:52.914 --> 18:54.611
They told --

18:57.397 --> 18:59.094
-Can you run?
-What?

18:59.138 --> 19:00.835
I said can you run?

19:00.878 --> 19:02.489
Are you kidding?

19:02.532 --> 19:03.925
I don't know
why I'm askin'.

19:03.968 --> 19:06.014
-We don't have a choice.
-Come with me.

19:08.103 --> 19:09.713
Get in.

19:24.946 --> 19:27.253
Oh, God damn it.

19:28.950 --> 19:30.908
You're okay, right?

19:30.952 --> 19:32.867
Oh, I'm aces.

19:37.567 --> 19:39.874
Who the hell are they?

19:39.917 --> 19:43.007
People who weren't good enough
for your settlement.

19:47.969 --> 19:50.493
Musta hit the fuel
tank. She ain't gonna
take us much further.

19:50.537 --> 19:51.842
Shit.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.328
-Can you run?
-Is that a question this time?

20:02.070 --> 20:03.985
Ooh.

20:05.334 --> 20:07.423
-Come on. Let's go!
-Oh!

20:11.993 --> 20:14.778
Over there!
She went over there!

20:14.822 --> 20:17.085
-Move out! Go, go!
-Fan out!

20:17.128 --> 20:20.480
-Go, go, go!
-We'll find her.

20:20.523 --> 20:22.569
-Spread out! Find her!

20:22.612 --> 20:24.353
We can't outrun them.
We should pick 'em off.

20:24.397 --> 20:26.181
No, there's
too many of 'em.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.749
Only way we live is to get
distance between them and us.

20:28.792 --> 20:30.316
Aah!

20:30.359 --> 20:32.361
Take -- Take cover!
I'll draw 'em away!

20:33.710 --> 20:35.538
Spread out! This way!

21:01.782 --> 21:04.480
No.
If you're gonna kill me...

21:04.524 --> 21:06.743
at least let me
see your face.

21:06.787 --> 21:08.571
-Don't!
-What the hell, Morgan?!

21:08.615 --> 21:12.183
Listen, if she dies, people
I care about will die, too.

21:12.227 --> 21:14.751
I am <i>done
waiting for you!</i>

21:18.625 --> 21:22.585
I don't know you. You're not
from one of my franchises.

21:22.629 --> 21:24.500
But I know <i>you.</i>

21:24.544 --> 21:25.588
Unh!

21:25.632 --> 21:27.068
Aah!

21:28.809 --> 21:31.377
I told you...
people will die!

21:32.508 --> 21:34.380
You're just as bad
as she is, Morgan.

21:34.423 --> 21:36.425
What did you say to me?

21:36.469 --> 21:38.427
You're just as bad
as she is.

21:38.471 --> 21:40.473
Pretending you're
helping people...

21:40.516 --> 21:42.344
when all you're doing
is hurting them.

21:42.388 --> 21:45.216
The time will come when she
will get what she deserves,

21:45.260 --> 21:47.523
but that time is not now.

21:47.567 --> 21:49.830
Sherry?!
-We need to move.

21:52.223 --> 21:54.965
Let's go. Let's go.

22:13.288 --> 22:15.812
We need to keep going.

22:18.249 --> 22:20.208
You told the truth, right?

22:20.251 --> 22:21.775
About Dakota?

22:23.298 --> 22:24.865
Why would I lie?

22:24.908 --> 22:28.042
So that I would
take you to her.

22:28.085 --> 22:31.611
Because you saw Al's movie
and you know I got a son.

22:31.654 --> 22:34.440
I would not lie about
something like that.

22:34.483 --> 22:36.442
Right.
I need to see her.

22:38.531 --> 22:39.880
Where you taking me?

22:39.923 --> 22:42.143
Someplace I'm building.

22:42.186 --> 22:43.492
How'd you find it?

22:43.536 --> 22:46.060
I didn't. Isaac did.

22:46.103 --> 22:47.278
Isaac?

22:47.322 --> 22:49.846
Yeah. He was
one of your rangers.

22:53.110 --> 22:55.896
Everyone's turning
on me today.

22:55.939 --> 22:58.638
Is Dakota there?
Is she with him?

22:58.681 --> 23:00.901
Isaac died.

23:00.944 --> 23:03.643
His wife, Rachel --
she's there.

23:08.517 --> 23:12.129
Just wait. Just wait.
Just let us go away together.

23:12.173 --> 23:15.176
And we'll find someplace
that is so far away from here,

23:15.219 --> 23:17.134
you won't ever
see us again.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.354
Please.

23:19.398 --> 23:23.097
What makes you think she's gonna
want to go anyplace with you?

23:23.140 --> 23:24.707
No, you're just saying that.

23:24.751 --> 23:27.580
-Come on.
-Unh. You're just saying that.

23:27.623 --> 23:29.973
That means you can kill me
without another thought.

23:30.017 --> 23:33.455
You took 'em away from me,
Virginia, all of 'em.

23:33.499 --> 23:37.372
You shot me.
Left me for dead.

23:37.416 --> 23:39.374
Sent a killer
to chop my head off.

23:39.418 --> 23:41.768
And then your daughter killed
one of the last friends

23:41.811 --> 23:44.466
I had in this world, so, yeah,
I'd kill you if I could!

23:46.425 --> 23:50.994
I'd like to do exactly
what Dakota wants me to do.

23:51.038 --> 23:55.956
But I will not let that be
the reason why I survived.

23:55.999 --> 23:58.088
You should've finished me off
at the Gulch

23:58.132 --> 23:59.612
-when you had the chance.
-Yeah, I should've.

23:59.655 --> 24:01.918
Well, so, why didn't you?
Huh?

24:01.962 --> 24:04.355
Why didn't you?!'Cause there's some
little part of you,

24:04.399 --> 24:06.575
the part that's willing
to risk everything for just

24:06.619 --> 24:08.490
one person, that reminds me
of what I'm doing for my k--

24:08.534 --> 24:10.753
No, you and me
are not the same.

24:10.797 --> 24:13.321
Morgan.

24:16.237 --> 24:18.544
We're <i>all</i> the same.

24:22.809 --> 24:24.593
Let's just go, huh?

24:34.342 --> 24:36.692
You <i>have</i> been busy.

24:40.435 --> 24:43.612
Yeah. Oh, we have.

24:47.616 --> 24:49.009
Why would you
bring her here?

24:49.052 --> 24:51.185
What the hell
are you doing, Morgan?

24:52.578 --> 24:55.624
I saw your bodies.
You turned.

24:55.668 --> 24:57.278
Shoulda looked harder.

24:57.321 --> 24:59.933
I couldn't raise you on the
walkies. It was too risky.

24:59.976 --> 25:04.154
She lost Lawton, but
she's got Daniel and Grace.

25:04.198 --> 25:07.418
I had to agree to swap Dakota
to get 'em back.

25:07.462 --> 25:09.203
Alicia, get her sister.

25:09.246 --> 25:12.119
It's the only way
to save 'em.

25:16.819 --> 25:19.909
That is us
keeping up our end.

25:19.953 --> 25:23.260
Time's coming soon
for you to keep up yours.

25:36.926 --> 25:39.799
Reminds me of my grandparents'
farm outside Temple.

25:39.842 --> 25:42.802
We're not here to reminisce.
This way.

25:54.640 --> 25:57.817
What are you calling
this place?

25:57.860 --> 25:59.470
Doesn't have a name yet.

26:00.863 --> 26:03.257
Rachel.
Who's this?

26:03.300 --> 26:05.651
She shouldn't be here!

26:05.694 --> 26:07.566
Isaac wouldn't have
wanted it.

26:07.609 --> 26:10.046
Rachel,
she's not stayin'.

26:12.309 --> 26:15.530
Where's Dakota?

26:15.574 --> 26:17.227
Church.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.881
-Can I talk to her now?
-Yeah.

26:18.925 --> 26:21.667
Hey, Morgan.
Strand's here.

26:21.710 --> 26:24.147
And he brought company.

26:27.498 --> 26:29.457
Here.

26:32.591 --> 26:34.680
-How many? <i>
-I don't know.</i>

26:34.723 --> 26:36.159
At least a dozen.

26:36.203 --> 26:38.074
Mostly rangers
on the high ground.

26:38.118 --> 26:39.859
We know she's in there!

26:39.902 --> 26:42.513
I've got a lot ofpeople out here who have
grievances with her.

26:42.557 --> 26:44.124
And we're not the only ones.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.922
<i>-Scratch that.
-Damn it.</i>

26:59.966 --> 27:01.663
<i>The MRAP's here, too.</i>

27:08.844 --> 27:11.151
Where is she?
Don't be stupid!

27:11.194 --> 27:12.282
-We want to see her!
-Let's go!

27:12.326 --> 27:14.284
We want justice!

27:14.328 --> 27:15.764
-Come on!
-You're surrounded!

27:15.808 --> 27:17.940
-Virginia!
-Where's Virginia?

27:17.984 --> 27:20.377
-Come out!

27:20.421 --> 27:23.337
<i>We've got some itchy
trigger fingers out here.</i>

27:23.380 --> 27:25.905
<i>What's our move?</i>

27:25.948 --> 27:28.211
What do they want
with her?

27:30.039 --> 27:31.911
What do you want with her,
Victor?

27:31.954 --> 27:34.522
Simple. Justice.

27:34.565 --> 27:36.132
<i>The genuine article.</i>

27:36.176 --> 27:39.396
<i>Not the twisted version
she's been doling out.</i>

27:39.440 --> 27:41.660
We're not turning her over.

27:41.703 --> 27:44.880
We will never get Grace
and Daniel back if we do.

27:49.450 --> 27:52.932
Ask Strand what happens
if we don't turn her over.

27:52.975 --> 27:54.716
And if we don't?

27:59.286 --> 28:00.809
We'll <i>take</i> her.

28:00.853 --> 28:03.551
<i>You hear that?
I think he means it.</i>

28:03.594 --> 28:05.422
He'll never get through
those walls.

28:05.466 --> 28:07.120
Yeah, but people
will still get hurt.

28:07.163 --> 28:08.774
Okay?
Sh-- Sherry's out there.

28:08.817 --> 28:10.601
-Yeah.
-I can talk to Strand.

28:10.645 --> 28:11.951
Will he listen?

28:13.430 --> 28:15.389
No, but I promised him
I'd try.

28:15.432 --> 28:17.043
Okay.

28:17.086 --> 28:20.437
Wait a second. Wait a second.
You're right.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.788
I know most of those
men and women out there.

28:22.831 --> 28:24.877
Even if they can't get through
those walls,

28:24.920 --> 28:27.227
they'll do everything they can
to destroy what's inside.

28:27.270 --> 28:28.794
You have
a better suggestion?

28:28.837 --> 28:30.621
Yeah, I do.

28:34.669 --> 28:36.018
I want to change our deal.

28:36.062 --> 28:37.411
Change it to what?

28:39.108 --> 28:41.589
I will go out there.

28:41.632 --> 28:43.547
I'll let you keep this place
what it is.

28:43.591 --> 28:44.766
Wanting what in return?

28:46.072 --> 28:47.769
Dakota gets to live here.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.640
Now she gets
a second chance.

28:51.512 --> 28:53.557
What she did to John,
that was not her fault.

28:53.601 --> 28:54.994
It was mine.

28:55.037 --> 28:58.301
They'll kill you.
Strand and the rangers.

28:58.345 --> 29:00.826
I-If they don't,
Sherry will, for sure.

29:09.573 --> 29:13.403
I thought she might've
needed me, but...

29:13.447 --> 29:15.971
Maybe <i>this
is what she needs.</i>

29:20.236 --> 29:22.108
Talk to her first.

29:22.151 --> 29:24.066
No, you can't
make me do that.

29:24.110 --> 29:28.854
It'll just be easier this way.
I'll just go.

29:28.897 --> 29:30.812
But there's one more thing,
Morgan.

29:30.856 --> 29:33.336
Oh, there is?
And what's that?

29:36.731 --> 29:40.126
I am willin' to die. I am.

29:40.169 --> 29:43.259
But it looks like
they wanna twist the knife.

29:43.303 --> 29:46.219
Make me feel it.

29:46.262 --> 29:47.873
I don't wanna
give them that.

29:47.916 --> 29:50.092
What are you asking for,
Virginia?

29:50.136 --> 29:54.444
I can release Grace
and Daniel right now.

29:54.488 --> 29:59.667
I can make sure no one else
gets hurt on my watch...

29:59.710 --> 30:01.974
if you do the honors.

30:02.017 --> 30:04.628
You said you couldn't let the
reason you survived all this

30:04.672 --> 30:06.848
be just to kill me.

30:06.892 --> 30:09.546
You kill me,
this fight ends.

30:09.590 --> 30:12.854
You secure the future
of this place.

30:34.789 --> 30:38.140
Here.
Make the call.

31:09.998 --> 31:12.131
Before I die...

31:16.831 --> 31:19.225
...I want y'all to know...

31:19.268 --> 31:21.923
everything I did,
I did to keep you all alive.

31:21.967 --> 31:23.142
Ha!

31:24.883 --> 31:27.320
Just like I'm doing now,

31:27.363 --> 31:30.366
by takin' my medicine.

31:30.410 --> 31:33.108
As long as Morgan here
is serving it up.

31:33.152 --> 31:34.936
Perhaps you
misunderstood.

31:34.980 --> 31:37.069
We wanted you to
hand her over to us

31:37.112 --> 31:39.027
so <i>we</i> could get
the satisfaction.

31:39.071 --> 31:40.986
She's let Grace
and Daniel go.

31:41.029 --> 31:42.944
Said she would
if I did this.

31:42.988 --> 31:45.381
-Morgan --
-Just gotta let me.

32:03.486 --> 32:05.358
Here.

32:08.491 --> 32:10.363
Come on!

33:24.524 --> 33:26.700
-Oh, God! Come on.

33:28.745 --> 33:30.486
Come on.

33:30.530 --> 33:33.794
Don't -- Don't get
cold feet now! Come on.

33:35.709 --> 33:37.624
Come on.
The things you did,

33:37.667 --> 33:41.280
you said you were doin' 'em
for the future of your kid.

33:41.323 --> 33:43.934
What the hell are we
trying to do here?

33:43.978 --> 33:45.501
What the hell
are we doing here?!

33:45.545 --> 33:48.678
What the hell are you doing?!
Hurry up, God damn it!

33:48.722 --> 33:51.594
Let's go! Come on!
Come on! You can do it!

33:51.638 --> 33:53.857
-They want you to do it!
-I know what they
want me to do!

33:53.901 --> 33:56.077
Let's go! Let's go!

33:56.121 --> 33:58.601
Please. Please.
You wanna do it.

33:58.645 --> 34:01.561
The future I'm trying to build,
if we start like this,

34:01.604 --> 34:03.911
then we are no better
than you!

34:03.954 --> 34:05.304
We are no better than her!

34:05.347 --> 34:07.088
Enough!
It's not enough!

34:09.395 --> 34:12.006
This isn't enough.

34:12.050 --> 34:15.183
This?
It's just the end of it.

34:15.227 --> 34:17.446
There's no satisfaction here.

34:17.490 --> 34:21.755
You want satisfaction, Victor?!
Then we should twist the knife!

34:23.583 --> 34:25.933
We should --

34:25.976 --> 34:27.978
We should make her
feel it!

34:29.415 --> 34:31.547
She should tell the truth!

34:34.420 --> 34:37.249
-You're gonna tell the truth.
-What?

34:37.292 --> 34:39.773
What are you doing, Morgan?
Come on.

34:39.816 --> 34:41.340
Just back up.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.454
Why is she here?!

35:08.497 --> 35:10.499
<i>They're getting restless,
Morgan.</i>

35:10.543 --> 35:12.675
<i>Strand says
if you don't hand her over,</i>

35:12.719 --> 35:15.113
<i>they're coming in
and taking her themselves.</i>

35:16.288 --> 35:18.377
They finally
turned on you.

35:18.420 --> 35:21.031
She has something
she needs to tell you.

35:21.075 --> 35:22.424
Why didn't you kill her?

35:22.468 --> 35:24.426
<i>Morgan.</i>

35:24.470 --> 35:27.255
Take a minute.

35:27.299 --> 35:30.258
I stuck my neck out for you
so you could be here.

35:30.302 --> 35:33.174
You try anything --
I mean anything --

35:33.218 --> 35:35.611
you won't get
another chance.

35:45.012 --> 35:47.667
Everything that I did,

35:47.710 --> 35:49.843
I did to get away from you.

35:49.886 --> 35:52.062
And now you're here.

35:52.106 --> 35:54.717
I know
what you think of me.

35:54.761 --> 35:56.893
But I just need you to know
that everything I did I --

35:56.937 --> 35:59.592
No, I-I -- I don't want
to hear your voice.

35:59.635 --> 36:01.463
I don't even
want to see you!

36:01.507 --> 36:03.639
I just wanted to give you
a normal life, Dakota.

36:03.683 --> 36:07.643
Then why didn't you treat me
like you actually cared?

36:07.687 --> 36:10.124
Why?

36:10.168 --> 36:11.604
I don't know.

36:11.647 --> 36:12.953
Why?!

36:16.739 --> 36:21.179
I don't know, I don't know.
I just didn't know how.

36:21.222 --> 36:23.833
Virginia, you killed
our parents.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.531
They weren't your p--

36:28.142 --> 36:30.231
You murdered them!

36:30.275 --> 36:32.059
Give me a second.

36:32.102 --> 36:34.322
Give me a second, please.

36:34.366 --> 36:37.934
They weren't
your parents, Dakota.

36:37.978 --> 36:40.720
And I'm not your sister.

36:40.763 --> 36:42.896
I'm your mother.

36:49.119 --> 36:50.512
No.

36:50.556 --> 36:52.732
No. Now, you gotta
listen to me, all right?

36:52.775 --> 36:54.429
None of this
was your fault.

36:54.473 --> 36:56.170
No.

36:56.214 --> 36:58.868
The way you came into this
world, your grandparents,

36:58.912 --> 37:02.698
they did not protect you,
they -- they did not protect me.

37:02.742 --> 37:05.135
I had to get you
out of there.

37:05.179 --> 37:06.920
So you're saying...

37:06.963 --> 37:09.488
you're saying that
you killed them for me?

37:09.531 --> 37:12.055
That you did
all of this for me?

37:12.099 --> 37:15.450
Everything I have done,

37:15.494 --> 37:17.974
everything I've built...

37:18.018 --> 37:20.760
was so that nothing
like what happened to me

37:20.803 --> 37:23.937
would ever happen to you.

37:23.980 --> 37:25.678
Then why didn't you
tell me?

37:25.721 --> 37:28.376
I thought not knowing
would protect you.

37:28.420 --> 37:32.206
The same way I thought
Lawton would.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.990
The ugliness of this world,

37:34.034 --> 37:35.818
I tried to turn you
away from it,

37:35.862 --> 37:37.994
to give you
a different world to see.

37:38.038 --> 37:41.520
But what that took,
that was ugly.

37:41.563 --> 37:45.828
I just saw it as work,
as what I had to do.

37:45.872 --> 37:47.700
I've always loved you.
No.

37:47.743 --> 37:49.441
I have always loved you,

37:49.484 --> 37:52.618
and I think I've found a way
to give you a second chance

37:52.661 --> 37:55.185
that you deserve
in the place you deserve.

37:55.229 --> 37:57.013
But you have to want it.

37:57.057 --> 37:58.928
You're gonna have to work
for it. Do you hear me?

37:58.972 --> 38:01.366
-What does it even matter?
-What does what matter?

38:01.409 --> 38:04.543
I killed people.
You killed people.

38:06.849 --> 38:09.722
Why did you even bring me
into this world?!

38:09.765 --> 38:11.245
No, don't say that.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.594
I should have never
been alive!

38:12.638 --> 38:14.204
-Don't you dare say that!
-None of us should.

38:14.248 --> 38:16.206
-Don't say that, please!
-Stop! Just stop!

38:39.578 --> 38:41.580
What's going on, Victor?

38:41.623 --> 38:43.364
You remember.

38:43.408 --> 38:46.149
That's a conversation
for another day.

38:46.193 --> 38:48.195
Where's everyone else?

38:52.286 --> 38:53.461
Where is she, Morgan?

38:53.505 --> 38:57.987
She is inside.
And she's still alive.

39:00.686 --> 39:03.689
You know, John...

39:03.732 --> 39:06.909
he said something to me
the last time I saw him.

39:06.953 --> 39:09.434
He said that "the ground we
stand on is soaked in blood,"

39:09.477 --> 39:11.610
and he was right.

39:11.653 --> 39:14.395
There has been so much killing
to get us here.

39:14.439 --> 39:18.225
To get us to win.
And we have won, right?

39:19.705 --> 39:22.316
But John just wanted
the killing to stop.

39:22.360 --> 39:25.014
And I want it to stop.
Don't you?

39:25.058 --> 39:27.103
Want it to just stop?

39:27.147 --> 39:31.064
I figure we should start that
by having her live.

39:31.107 --> 39:34.197
By making her live
with what she's done.

39:46.340 --> 39:49.474
That stays there
until we need it again,

39:49.517 --> 39:52.825
and I pray to God
that we don't.

39:52.868 --> 39:55.175
That is not
your call to make.

39:55.218 --> 39:57.699
-Hey --
-No, t-this isn't good enough.

39:57.743 --> 39:59.614
These people suffered
because of her!

39:59.658 --> 40:01.877
-Okay.
-Bring her back out here now!

40:01.921 --> 40:03.139
Hey. Hey. Hey!

40:03.183 --> 40:05.315
Calm down.

40:05.359 --> 40:07.492
Virginia's caused
enough damage.

40:07.535 --> 40:10.712
Let's not allow our disagreement
over her to cause any more.

40:26.032 --> 40:28.730
I really hope you know
what you're doing, Morgan.

40:35.868 --> 40:39.785
Anybody who's ready to abide
by the rules and the foundations

40:39.828 --> 40:42.309
that we are laying down here,

40:42.352 --> 40:45.399
you are more than welcome
to stay!

40:45.443 --> 40:48.924
I asked you to live before.

40:48.968 --> 40:52.188
To just live.

40:52.232 --> 40:55.757
I hope today's the day
when we can start doing that.

40:55.801 --> 40:58.151
And do it here.

41:38.321 --> 41:40.149
Hey, Sarah.
Mo-mo.

41:40.193 --> 41:42.587
Hey, Rabbi.

41:46.504 --> 41:49.637
Hey.

41:49.681 --> 41:52.335
You all right?

42:04.086 --> 42:05.914
I am so sorry.

42:05.958 --> 42:09.439
Why?

42:09.483 --> 42:11.441
For taking
as long as I did.

42:13.052 --> 42:16.795
You don't have to
apologize.

42:16.838 --> 42:20.886
I wouldn't be here if you hadn't
fought the way you did for me.

42:20.929 --> 42:23.018
He wouldn't be here.

42:23.062 --> 42:25.281
"He"?

42:25.325 --> 42:26.935
It's a boy...

42:26.979 --> 42:30.635
I don't know for sure.
I just...have a feeling.

42:33.725 --> 42:35.814
Come on.

42:35.857 --> 42:37.206
Ohh.

42:37.250 --> 42:39.469
You don't like it?

42:39.513 --> 42:43.865
Well, you may have had to do
some things you didn't want to.

42:46.085 --> 42:48.043
But what you did
up there...

42:50.785 --> 42:53.179
...you're still
the same man I knew.

42:56.748 --> 42:58.793
I don't know, Grace.

43:13.982 --> 43:15.984
It was one of John's.
He wrote it for you

43:16.028 --> 43:18.900
when he thought he wasn't
gonna see you again.

43:18.944 --> 43:22.425
And...well, I-I thought
you should have it.

43:36.744 --> 43:39.268
Honey.

43:39.312 --> 43:41.967
Go on.
Hey.

43:47.712 --> 43:49.583
Why aren't you coming
inside with me?

43:49.627 --> 43:51.280
Because...

43:51.324 --> 43:53.761
I'm not gonna find what
I'm looking for in there.

43:53.805 --> 43:55.763
Well, w-what?!
What are you looking for?

43:55.807 --> 43:57.896
You were right.
You were right.

43:57.939 --> 44:00.942
I -- I had a shot
at killing Ginny,

44:00.986 --> 44:03.510
and it didn't feel like
I thought it would.

44:03.553 --> 44:07.732
It didn't feel like -- like I
was putting the past behind me.

44:07.775 --> 44:09.951
Because you weren't.

44:09.995 --> 44:11.387
In there --
In there, you can start to.

44:11.431 --> 44:14.695
I didn't feel like I was
putting the past behind me...

44:14.739 --> 44:17.350
but it felt like a start.

44:17.393 --> 44:20.135
Okay?
Okay.

44:20.179 --> 44:21.963
I can't go in there, D.

44:22.007 --> 44:24.574
-Come on.
-No, I'm not where you are.

44:25.793 --> 44:28.753
And I --

44:28.796 --> 44:32.670
I think I'm gonna find it with
them before I find it with you.

44:34.323 --> 44:36.108
Okay.

44:56.519 --> 44:57.782
Where are you going?

44:57.825 --> 45:00.045
This place --
it's not for me.

45:00.088 --> 45:02.482
You asked me to make sure
I didn't forget who I am.

45:02.525 --> 45:04.223
-I'm asking you to do the same.
-I know.

45:04.266 --> 45:07.008
But what's coming, what Virginia
was building this army for --

45:07.052 --> 45:09.054
it's still out there.
You can't stay in there

45:09.097 --> 45:11.273
-pretending that it's not.
-That's not what we're doing.

45:11.317 --> 45:12.666
Then come with me.

45:12.710 --> 45:15.103
Whatever's coming,
we can face it together.

45:15.147 --> 45:19.368
I <i>wanted</i> us to do this together.
You made it clear you didn't.

45:21.066 --> 45:23.764
Why should I
believe you now?

45:23.808 --> 45:27.899
You don't have to.
I'll show you.

45:27.942 --> 45:30.118
I'll give you a reason
to come and join me.

46:05.937 --> 46:07.677
Ugh!

46:10.376 --> 46:12.421
The bullet's out.

46:12.465 --> 46:14.597
June.

46:14.641 --> 46:17.209
You're back.

46:17.252 --> 46:20.647
You rest up a few more days,
you'll be fine to go.

46:28.786 --> 46:31.310
That's the second time now
you saved my life.

46:31.353 --> 46:33.486
Thank you.

46:35.575 --> 46:37.664
We all had a talk,
and we're gonna let you do

46:37.707 --> 46:39.535
what you asked
to do before --

46:39.579 --> 46:41.755
you're gonna take Dakota
and leave.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.888
She doesn't need this place.
She needs <i>you.</i>

46:43.931 --> 46:45.846
But if either of you
show your face again --

46:45.890 --> 46:47.717
Oh, no, I get it.
We're gone.

46:47.761 --> 46:50.503
You follow the riverbed, there's
a pass through the mountains.

46:50.546 --> 46:52.766
That's how you get out of here
without your rangers

46:52.810 --> 46:54.768
finding you.
Thank you.

46:54.812 --> 46:57.771
We're not doing it for you.
We're doing it for her.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.947
We'll get Dakota.

46:59.991 --> 47:02.297
I'm gonna change
her dressing.

47:18.139 --> 47:21.926
You shouldn't give a lick
what I have to say, but...

47:21.969 --> 47:24.798
I reckon I owe you
any number of apologies.

47:24.842 --> 47:27.322
This has nothing
to do with you.

47:27.366 --> 47:29.194
Follows me wherever I go.

47:29.237 --> 47:31.631
Like some kind of
punishment for my past.

47:37.855 --> 47:40.031
I had a daughter.

47:42.207 --> 47:43.861
Her name was Rose.

47:45.384 --> 47:46.864
She was sick.

47:49.997 --> 47:53.435
I tried to protect her.

47:53.479 --> 47:56.351
I ended up getting every
survivor in my camp killed.

47:56.395 --> 47:58.919
So of course the love of my life
was killed by someone's daughter

47:58.963 --> 48:02.009
they were
"trying to protect."

48:02.053 --> 48:04.838
In a way, this is
exactly what I deserve.

48:04.882 --> 48:08.189
Well, you were just trying
to protect your kid.

48:08.233 --> 48:09.799
Just like I was.

48:19.635 --> 48:21.376
Did you know?

48:22.987 --> 48:26.033
Back at Lawton,
with Cameron?

48:26.077 --> 48:29.254
Did you know what Dakota
was capable of before?

48:29.297 --> 48:31.212
Did you protect her
anyway?

48:31.256 --> 48:34.389
I would do anything
for my daughter, June.

48:47.228 --> 48:50.666
This is the gun
Dakota killed John with.

48:59.458 --> 49:03.027
I didn't protect my daughter
after she killed someone.

49:03.070 --> 49:04.724
I asked you
a question before.

49:04.767 --> 49:06.465
-June --
-Why did Dakota kill my husband?

49:06.508 --> 49:08.032
-You said you didn't know.
-No, no.

49:08.075 --> 49:10.034
That wasn't true.

49:10.077 --> 49:11.687
It <i>was</i> you, Virginia.

49:11.731 --> 49:12.862
You're the reason.

49:12.906 --> 49:14.255
June --
You always were.

49:14.299 --> 49:16.170
No. Wait!

49:28.922 --> 49:32.621
June, what happened?
You okay?

49:34.536 --> 49:38.018
No. No...

49:42.109 --> 49:43.284
June!

49:47.071 --> 49:49.247
June!

50:33.987 --> 50:35.075
Well, you should be scared.

50:35.119 --> 50:36.294
Why is that?

50:36.337 --> 50:37.730
'Cause it's over for you.

50:37.773 --> 50:40.341
Everything you are,
everything you were,

50:40.385 --> 50:43.562
everything you had
is gonna get stripped away.

50:43.605 --> 50:45.390
And that's scary.

50:45.433 --> 50:47.609
This episode is called
"Things Left to Do."

50:47.653 --> 50:49.481
This title is really a reference

50:49.524 --> 50:52.397
to something that Morgan's
been grappling with

50:52.440 --> 50:55.574
since episode 601 in the season.

50:55.617 --> 50:57.793
He had that letter
when he woke up in the church,

50:57.837 --> 51:00.187
and in the last episode,
he found out the truth,

51:00.231 --> 51:02.102
that it was actually
Dakota who saved him

51:02.146 --> 51:04.017
and that she wanted him to live

51:04.061 --> 51:06.367
so that he could
defeat her sister.

51:06.411 --> 51:08.543
I'm right here!

51:08.587 --> 51:11.720
And this episode really is
about Morgan kind of grappling

51:11.764 --> 51:15.376
with what it is he has to do,
why he's alive.

51:15.420 --> 51:17.857
It just really felt like
that was the fitting way

51:17.900 --> 51:21.687
to bring this story
to a bit of a conclusion.

51:21.730 --> 51:23.428
Shoot the old man, Victor!
Shoot the old man right now!

51:23.471 --> 51:27.040
She sold you
on her vision of the future,

51:27.084 --> 51:29.695
but there is no future
in this place with her!

51:29.738 --> 51:32.001
Never was.

51:32.045 --> 51:34.613
That moment was really
all about putting the audience

51:34.656 --> 51:35.962
in a place
where they weren't sure

51:36.005 --> 51:37.398
what Strand was gonna do.

51:37.442 --> 51:39.618
You know, he is the character
who sometimes

51:39.661 --> 51:41.402
you know the least
about his intentions,

51:41.446 --> 51:42.969
and I think sometimes
he's not even sure

51:43.012 --> 51:44.318
what his intentions are.

51:44.362 --> 51:47.365
You told me to get ready
for the big show.

51:47.408 --> 51:49.323
I am.

51:49.367 --> 51:51.064
So are they.

51:51.108 --> 51:52.457
And that whole sequence

51:52.500 --> 51:54.198
was really about
kind of building the tension

51:54.241 --> 51:55.895
and building the suspense.

51:55.938 --> 51:58.027
And I think, for Strand,
he really kind of saw

51:58.071 --> 51:59.420
which way
the wind was blowing...

51:59.464 --> 52:00.769
Aaah!

52:00.813 --> 52:02.641
...and saw that it was
his opportunity

52:02.684 --> 52:05.774
to kind of finally grab the bull
by the horns and seize power,

52:05.818 --> 52:07.602
and that's ultimately
what he does.

52:12.346 --> 52:16.263
That moment when Morgan's
preparing to execute Virginia

52:16.307 --> 52:18.831
is really kind of
all about Morgan's journey

52:18.874 --> 52:21.486
in the first half of the season
coming to a head.

52:21.529 --> 52:23.531
So much of this season
has been about Morgan

52:23.575 --> 52:26.099
attempting to change,
attempting to become the person

52:26.143 --> 52:27.448
he thinks everyone
needs him to be

52:27.492 --> 52:31.060
so he can be
an effective leader.

52:31.104 --> 52:32.671
Here.

52:32.714 --> 52:35.108
Morgan's a guy
who's got tons of anxiety

52:35.152 --> 52:37.110
about whether he'll go down
the dark road,

52:37.154 --> 52:39.808
and this is about him
trying to put together

52:39.852 --> 52:43.029
all the different pieces of him
and make the right decision.

52:43.072 --> 52:45.031
The things you did,
you said you were doing them

52:45.074 --> 52:47.294
for the future of your kid.

52:47.338 --> 52:49.514
The hell are we
trying to do here?

52:49.557 --> 52:52.691
He realizes that, in order
to build the kind of place

52:52.734 --> 52:54.214
he wants to build here,

52:54.258 --> 52:56.260
it has to be different
than what Virginia did.

52:56.303 --> 52:57.652
That means there can't be
a single person

52:57.696 --> 53:00.220
deciding who gets to live,
who gets to die.

53:00.264 --> 53:02.091
Come on!
Come on! You can do it!

53:02.135 --> 53:03.310
They want you to do it!

53:03.354 --> 53:04.442
I know what
they want me to do!

53:04.485 --> 53:06.183
Let's go!
Let's go!

53:06.226 --> 53:07.880
Oh, God!
Please, please.

53:07.923 --> 53:09.186
You want to do it.

53:09.229 --> 53:10.709
The future
I'm trying to build,

53:10.752 --> 53:13.842
if we start like this,
then we are no better than you!

53:13.886 --> 53:16.715
He really wants
to build it in honor of

53:16.758 --> 53:18.543
the friend he just lost,
John Dorie,

53:18.586 --> 53:21.067
and I think, for Morgan,
he now wants to create

53:21.110 --> 53:23.156
that world
that John Dorie envisioned,

53:23.200 --> 53:25.158
and, ultimately,
that's the reason he decides

53:25.202 --> 53:27.987
not to start
this new settlement

53:28.030 --> 53:33.471
with blood being spilled
right outside its gates.

53:33.514 --> 53:36.561
That stays there
until we need it again,

53:36.604 --> 53:39.346
and I pray to God that we don't.

53:39.390 --> 53:41.696
It's him kind of reminding
himself and everyone else

53:41.740 --> 53:44.177
that every time they enter
and leave this place,

53:44.221 --> 53:46.310
that they are going
into a community

53:46.353 --> 53:48.355
that is different
than the outside world.

53:48.399 --> 53:51.315
The axe being there serves
as the visual reminder.

53:51.358 --> 53:54.970
I asked you to live before.

53:55.014 --> 53:57.799
To just live.

53:57.843 --> 54:00.498
I hope today's the day
when we can start doing that.

54:00.541 --> 54:02.587
But, also, at the same time,

54:02.630 --> 54:04.284
it's still kind of a metaphor
for Morgan.

54:04.328 --> 54:07.374
He wants to be able to put down
the warrior when he needs to

54:07.418 --> 54:09.202
so he can be the family man,

54:09.246 --> 54:11.509
he can be just a member
of the community,

54:11.552 --> 54:13.728
and that's really
what it's all about.

54:13.772 --> 54:17.471
You shouldn't give a lick
what I have to say, but...

54:17.515 --> 54:20.779
I reckon I owe you
any number of apologies.

54:20.822 --> 54:22.781
This has nothing
to do with you.

54:22.824 --> 54:25.044
Follows me wherever I go.

54:25.087 --> 54:27.394
Some kind of punishment
for my past.

54:27.438 --> 54:31.311
June learns the truth of
what Virginia was doing

54:31.355 --> 54:33.835
was all about protecting Dakota.

54:33.879 --> 54:37.448
Her kind of motherly desire
to protect her daughter

54:37.491 --> 54:39.319
led to a bunch of people
getting killed.

54:39.363 --> 54:42.148
And, in many ways,
that is exactly what has led

54:42.191 --> 54:43.541
to all the violence

54:43.584 --> 54:45.760
that has happened
under Virginia's rule.

54:45.804 --> 54:50.156
And I think June is aware enough
to recognize that, in many ways,

54:50.199 --> 54:51.810
they share that trait in common.

54:51.853 --> 54:53.551
I think, in her mind,
she may be wondering

54:53.594 --> 54:55.640
if there's kind of
some karmic retribution

54:55.683 --> 54:58.773
for the mistakes
that she's made in her past.

55:05.084 --> 55:07.565
This is the gun Dakota
killed John with.

55:12.091 --> 55:16.617
I think it's really hard
for June to allow Virginia

55:16.661 --> 55:19.664
to get away with this
because she enabled her daughter

55:19.707 --> 55:22.231
instead of helping her
in the way she should as mother.

55:22.275 --> 55:23.798
She just
allowed her to continue.

55:23.842 --> 55:25.278
But at the same time,
she feels like,

55:25.322 --> 55:26.584
"You know, I saved your life,

55:26.627 --> 55:28.673
so I can take it
in this moment, too."

55:28.716 --> 55:31.763
You're the reason.
You always were.

55:31.806 --> 55:33.634
No, wait -

55:37.508 --> 55:40.293
It's really
a harbinger of what's to come,

55:40.337 --> 55:43.035
because June has now gone
and done the one thing

55:43.078 --> 55:45.080
that John didn't want
in this settlement,

55:45.124 --> 55:46.865
even though, I think,
in June's heart,

55:46.908 --> 55:50.303
she truly believes
that she killed Virginia

55:50.347 --> 55:52.087
to make her pay
for John's death.

55:52.131 --> 55:55.395
At the same time,
she has unintentionally

55:55.439 --> 55:57.484
gone against John's last wishes,

55:57.528 --> 55:59.965
and that's really what
that moment is all about.
