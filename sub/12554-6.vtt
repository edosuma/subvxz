00:05.772 --> 00:07.240
CLYDE: <i>13 Bannerman Road</i>
<i>is where Sarah</i>
<i>Jane Smith lives</i>

00:07.307 --> 00:09.142
<i>and it's home to things</i>
<i>way beyond your imagination.</i>

00:12.779 --> 00:15.882
<i>There's an extraterrestrial</i>
<i>supercomputer in the wall,</i>

00:15.949 --> 00:19.853
<i>her son, a genetically</i>
<i>engineered boy genius,</i>

00:19.919 --> 00:22.389
<i>a schoolgirl investigator</i>
<i>across the road</i>

00:22.455 --> 00:24.290
<i>her adopted</i>
<i>daughter from another world</i>

00:24.357 --> 00:26.893
<i>and a whole</i>
<i>universe of adventure</i>
<i>right here on the doorstep.</i>

00:29.596 --> 00:30.530
(SCREAMS)

00:46.146 --> 00:47.847
-Ready?
-Always.

00:50.150 --> 00:52.485
<i>Hi. I'm Joseph Serf.</i>

00:52.552 --> 00:54.454
-Something weird
happened in there.
-He glitched.

00:54.654 --> 00:56.022
<i>Enhancing.</i>

00:56.089 --> 00:58.525
Oh, but if I could just
speak to Mr Serf,

00:58.591 --> 01:01.127
just to tell him
there are no glitches.

01:01.194 --> 01:03.596
Meet you both back
here in half an hour.

01:03.663 --> 01:05.532
Call me Sarah Jane.

01:07.467 --> 01:08.802
They're controlling him!

01:08.868 --> 01:10.637
Gotcha!

01:10.703 --> 01:13.173
-(SCREAMING)
-Please, let her go.
She's just a child!

01:13.239 --> 01:14.874
You! You!

01:29.055 --> 01:30.490
You! You!

01:30.557 --> 01:32.091
They're going to kill us!

01:33.293 --> 01:35.628
You must escape. Run!

01:37.530 --> 01:39.199
What? What?

01:39.265 --> 01:42.535
What do you know?
Who do you work for?

01:43.169 --> 01:45.071
Oh, Mr Harrison.

01:45.138 --> 01:48.875
This is not exactly
a new experience for me.

01:48.942 --> 01:50.510
SARAH JANE:
<i>You're not going to</i>
<i>fire that gun.</i>

01:50.577 --> 01:52.145
Oh, do you want to bet?

01:52.212 --> 01:54.914
I don't think you've ever
fired that gun.

01:54.981 --> 01:58.151
No. But there's a first time
for everything.

01:59.452 --> 02:01.221
I'm walking out now.

02:01.421 --> 02:02.856
You won't stop me.

02:03.857 --> 02:05.692
Sky, what are you doing?

02:06.659 --> 02:08.061
(SQUEALING)

02:10.395 --> 02:11.998
Grab her!

02:15.768 --> 02:19.639
Lipstick that bites?
How very interesting.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.942
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)

02:23.009 --> 02:24.777
What are you doing down there?

02:27.413 --> 02:29.749
Level five, punish!

02:29.816 --> 02:31.618
(HIGH FREQUENCY SOUND)

02:34.153 --> 02:36.789
-Luke,
make it stop, make it stop!
-I can't!

02:41.628 --> 02:43.596
Work, work!

02:45.832 --> 02:50.770
I'm sorry, I must have
blunked out
there for a second.

02:50.837 --> 02:53.473
My goadness, what's happening?

02:53.540 --> 02:56.075
Plark, forget it.
It's too late now.

02:58.878 --> 03:00.613
What are they doing in there?

03:02.515 --> 03:05.885
-No!
-Emergency!
Intruders in Light Chamber!

03:05.952 --> 03:07.787
Luke, Sky, get out of there!

03:07.854 --> 03:09.322
(ALARM BLARING)

03:09.389 --> 03:11.691
-Run, run, run!
-Come on!

03:18.464 --> 03:20.800
No!

03:20.867 --> 03:23.169
He should be back by now.
Come on, Luke, answer!

03:23.236 --> 03:25.505
Sky, answer, come on!

03:25.572 --> 03:27.874
MR SMITH: <i>Oh, pick it up</i>
<i>for once, Sarah Jane.</i>

03:30.276 --> 03:32.111
That's my phone!

03:32.178 --> 03:34.147
Welcome to the club. I've had
seven phones in
the last two years.

03:36.049 --> 03:37.951
-Sarah Jane!
-Oh, Mum!

03:38.017 --> 03:39.686
Thank goodness
you're all right!

03:39.752 --> 03:45.124
Bizarre! I expected high-class
industrial spies, not Mumsnet.

03:45.191 --> 03:47.927
-Mum, the hologram.
-There are aliens working it.

03:48.127 --> 03:50.997
-They're slaves.
-Coming, Master!

03:52.298 --> 03:54.567
-Plark.
-Master?

03:54.634 --> 03:58.104
You let these human
children roam free.

03:58.171 --> 04:00.773
-Master, no, please, Master!
-Level seven,

04:01.574 --> 04:03.676
-punish!
-Master! Ahhh!

04:03.743 --> 04:05.578
Stop it!

04:08.715 --> 04:10.350
You're hurting
these creatures!

04:10.416 --> 04:12.385
The poor little Skullions?

04:12.452 --> 04:16.623
Read my lips, Pollyanna.
I don't care.

04:16.689 --> 04:18.124
Plark, get back to work!

04:18.190 --> 04:21.928
Thank you, Master.
Love Master!

04:21.995 --> 04:24.797
-What are you doing to them?
-The Skullions?

04:24.864 --> 04:27.200
They merely need a firm hand.

04:27.266 --> 04:30.370
Listen, I can help you
and help them,
I can get them home.

04:30.436 --> 04:32.405
I don't need your help,
I'm doing fine.

04:32.472 --> 04:34.907
They're intelligent creatures.
You can't treat
them like that.

04:34.974 --> 04:37.243
Can't I?
I paid enough for them.

04:37.310 --> 04:39.278
You... You bought them?

04:39.345 --> 04:44.250
A ship crash-landed
in Central Asia. The survivors
were put up for sale.

04:44.317 --> 04:47.286
-What do you mean,
up for sale?
-Oh, didn't you know?

04:47.353 --> 04:51.624
There's a blackmarket in alien
species,
if you know where to look.

04:51.691 --> 04:55.194
They're smuggled across Europe
in crates,
then across the Channel.

04:55.261 --> 04:59.599
A slave trade in aliens?
Packing them up
in boxes, torturing them?

04:59.666 --> 05:03.436
It's appalling!
I can't believe
anybody could be so...

05:03.503 --> 05:05.471
Successful?

05:05.538 --> 05:09.142
(CHUCKLING) You're so naive.

05:09.208 --> 05:12.245
-This is the way
the world works.
-Not in my world.

05:12.311 --> 05:16.883
Yes, it is. Money is exchanged
for goods and services.

05:16.949 --> 05:22.088
Plenty of bidders at auction,
but I pay millions
to make billions.

05:22.155 --> 05:24.524
It's disgusting.
You're disgusting!

05:24.590 --> 05:26.392
I do my best.

05:26.459 --> 05:29.162
Now I'm beginning
to understand what
this is all about.

05:29.228 --> 05:31.464
There's nothing special
about the Serf Board,
is there?

05:31.531 --> 05:33.566
It's rubbish, yes.

05:33.633 --> 05:37.203
It's not the board, it's Serf,
the hologram. He's hypnotic.

05:37.270 --> 05:39.072
He can make you
desperate to buy one.

05:39.138 --> 05:41.040
Very good, carry on.

05:41.107 --> 05:43.443
In a few hours, the launch...
It'll be televised
all over the world.

05:43.509 --> 05:47.080
And Serf
hypnotises the entire world
to buy a Serf Board.

05:47.146 --> 05:51.184
And you'll make a fortune.
That's all
it is. The slaves, just money.

05:51.250 --> 05:53.186
Just profit.

05:53.252 --> 05:54.987
Shock horror!

05:56.089 --> 05:58.491
Right, enough debate.

05:58.558 --> 06:00.760
Put the kids in storage five.

06:00.827 --> 06:02.929
No,
you leave my children alone!
Luke, you look after her!

06:03.129 --> 06:05.631
I will!

06:05.698 --> 06:07.500
You dare harm my children...

06:07.567 --> 06:12.238
I'll deal with
them and you later.
After the launch.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.640
This way.

06:14.707 --> 06:17.443
I'm going to stop this.
I am going to stop you.

06:17.510 --> 06:19.712
Oh, what are you going to do,
hit me with your handbag?

06:24.250 --> 06:28.454
Are you hurting them?
Are you hurting
the little people?

06:30.423 --> 06:32.225
You are scum!

06:32.291 --> 06:35.528
Hold on, hold on!
I'm a prisoner just like you.

06:37.029 --> 06:39.398
The aliens aren't bad,
Harrison is.

06:39.465 --> 06:42.869
How could he do that?
It just makes me so angry!

06:42.935 --> 06:45.571
Humans used other humans
as slaves for centuries.

06:45.638 --> 06:47.874
Every culture the world over.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.610
Nobody ever challenged them
until a few hundred years ago.

06:50.676 --> 06:53.513
In some places
it still goes on.

06:53.579 --> 06:56.849
-Is this what humans are like?
-Not all of them.

06:58.117 --> 06:59.852
Come here.

07:02.088 --> 07:04.090
I can sleep
somewhere else in the house.

07:05.291 --> 07:06.092
What?

07:08.528 --> 07:10.429
If you want your room back,

07:10.496 --> 07:14.634
I think it upset you
but you're not telling me.

07:16.335 --> 07:20.606
It doesn't matter.
And this isn't the time.

07:20.673 --> 07:22.875
This morning
a little man pulled me
into the lift.

07:24.811 --> 07:26.879
The guards came,
they hurt him.

07:26.946 --> 07:30.016
I saw others, many others.

07:31.818 --> 07:34.120
Then the guards
locked me away.

07:34.187 --> 07:37.123
The Skullions, one of them
must have tried to escape.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.991
They must be desperate.

07:39.058 --> 07:42.261
They are dying
and we will die here, too.

07:42.328 --> 07:45.598
No! We're going
to get out of here.

07:45.665 --> 07:48.267
And the little people,
we must help them!

07:48.334 --> 07:49.902
Sarah Jane Smith.

07:51.103 --> 07:52.905
Adriana Petrescu.

07:52.972 --> 07:55.508
Adriana,
you've just restored my faith
in the human race.

07:57.610 --> 08:00.980
<i>In just two hours' time,</i>
<i>the Serf Board</i>
<i>will be revealed to the world,</i>

08:01.047 --> 08:02.949
<i>right here at Serf Systems.</i>

08:03.015 --> 08:05.351
<i>The eyes of the world</i>
<i>will be on this building.</i>

08:05.418 --> 08:07.486
<i>After months of rumours,</i>
<i>leaks,</i>

08:07.553 --> 08:10.923
<i>some say deliberate leaks,</i>
<i>and endless speculation,</i>

08:10.990 --> 08:15.428
<i>we'll finally get the answers</i>
<i>revealed by the secretive</i>
<i>Mr Joseph Serf.</i>

08:15.494 --> 08:17.830
MR SMITH: <i>That was the latest</i>
<i>news transmission.</i>

08:17.897 --> 08:19.932
We've got to get over there
and go to the launch.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.267
We can take Luke's car.

08:21.334 --> 08:23.202
Clyde, it's the media event
of the century.

08:23.269 --> 08:25.872
We can't just gatecrash it
like it's Adam Jenkins' party!

08:28.274 --> 08:31.844
Give me a minute. Mr Smith,
access Serf
Systems hospitality.

08:31.911 --> 08:34.847
-Get your best clothes on.
-MR SMITH:
<i>Accessing initiated.</i>

08:34.914 --> 08:37.850
-Move!
-MR SMITH:
<i>Logging in to Serf intranet.</i>

08:42.455 --> 08:44.056
(DOOR OPENING)

08:55.668 --> 08:58.871
Bring food for the young ones.
You like us, prisoners.

09:01.274 --> 09:02.575
Thanks.

09:04.744 --> 09:07.480
-You need this
more than we do.
-No, you drink.

09:07.546 --> 09:09.348
Pure water burns.

09:09.415 --> 09:12.818
-What do you drink?
-Orange, lemon juice, citrus.

09:15.488 --> 09:18.124
-Hey, stop!
-No! Girl stay!

09:18.190 --> 09:19.926
We can help you,
let us out of here.

09:19.992 --> 09:22.628
No, you stay!
Or Master punish!

09:32.071 --> 09:33.839
Oh, you need help.

09:35.141 --> 09:36.876
No. No help!

09:38.911 --> 09:41.781
You stay!

09:41.847 --> 09:44.417
He can't go against his master
or he gets another shock.

09:47.253 --> 09:49.522
The collars are controlled
through Harrison's pen.

09:49.588 --> 09:53.192
We can't do
anything to help the slaves
until we get it off him.

09:53.259 --> 09:56.462
If we could tell
Clyde and Rani,
get them to grab it.

09:56.529 --> 09:58.831
How?
They've destroyed our phones.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.802
What about your dog whistle?

10:02.868 --> 10:05.705
K9's miles away,
he'd never hear it.

10:05.771 --> 10:07.740
He's too far away.

10:09.108 --> 10:12.078
We've got to
think of something.

10:12.144 --> 10:14.280
What about Mr Smith?
Could he hear it?

10:14.347 --> 10:16.949
Yes! Yes!

10:17.016 --> 10:19.018
You are so my sister!

10:20.586 --> 10:22.621
Rani, come on,
the launch starts in an hour!

10:22.688 --> 10:24.457
Oh, you look great.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.327
Ah, I've done it!

10:28.394 --> 10:30.529
MR SMITH:
<i>Ahem, we have done it.</i>

10:30.596 --> 10:32.531
Whatever.

10:32.598 --> 10:35.368
Okay, we're in!
Trevor and Janet Sharp.

10:36.569 --> 10:39.038
Trevor?
Do I look like a Trevor?

10:39.105 --> 10:41.040
Although I am sharp.

10:41.107 --> 10:43.609
Oh,
they're consumer journalists
from <i>Twilight Years</i> magazine,

10:43.676 --> 10:45.277
for the over-60s.

10:45.344 --> 10:47.346
Geriatric news?
Couldn't you have
got anything better?

10:47.413 --> 10:49.682
They're the only
ones on the guest list
that won't turn up.

10:49.749 --> 10:53.719
MR SMITH: <i>Mr And Mrs Sharp</i>
<i>are stranded at Orly Airport,</i>
<i>thanks to a...</i>

10:53.786 --> 10:55.721
<i>ahem, computer malfunction.</i>

10:55.788 --> 10:57.023
Mr and Mrs?

10:57.089 --> 10:59.592
Oh, yeah,
and they're, uh, married.

10:59.658 --> 11:03.129
Right,
right, the cavalry's coming,
and it's me and the missus.

11:03.195 --> 11:05.398
-My old Dutch.
-Shut up, Clyde. Come on!

11:05.464 --> 11:08.868
MR SMITH: <i>Wait a moment. I'm</i>
<i>picking up a high-frequency</i>
<i>modulated signal</i>

11:08.934 --> 11:10.870
<i>in Morse code.</i>

11:10.936 --> 11:13.005
(HIGH FREQUENCY WHISTLING)

11:13.072 --> 11:15.641
Brilliant!

11:15.708 --> 11:19.111
<i>The transmission is on</i>
<i>the command frequency of K9.</i>

11:19.178 --> 11:22.281
-It must be Luke, the whistle!
-Or it's a trap.

11:22.348 --> 11:23.983
How do we know
it's Luke for sure?

11:24.050 --> 11:28.287
MR SMITH: <i>Deciphering.</i>
<i>Message begins, "Clani..."</i>

11:28.354 --> 11:30.156
Yeah, that's Luke.

11:30.222 --> 11:32.558
<i>"Grab Harrison's</i>

11:33.392 --> 11:37.363
<i>"P-E-N. Full stop."</i>

11:37.430 --> 11:40.166
Never been so glad
to see a full stop.
But what does it mean?

11:40.232 --> 11:43.469
What it says. Grab his pen!

11:43.536 --> 11:45.571
Are you sure you're ready
to go through with this?

11:45.638 --> 11:48.274
I will help the little people.
I'm ready.

11:48.340 --> 11:50.776
Oh, I hope I am.
It's an oldie but a goodie.

11:51.577 --> 11:53.412
Go!

11:53.479 --> 11:56.916
Help, help! This crazy woman,
she's trying to kill me!

11:56.982 --> 12:00.052
Help, please! Help, please!

12:01.087 --> 12:02.588
Rescue me!

12:03.589 --> 12:05.858
(GRUNTING)

12:05.925 --> 12:09.095
Hey, well done!
Let's go! Ha-ha!

12:19.872 --> 12:22.808
There must be no mistakes!

12:22.875 --> 12:27.713
Everything at
the launch must go
exactly according to plan.

12:27.780 --> 12:30.182
Yes, Master! Yes, Master!

12:30.249 --> 12:33.119
This time you are working
for your lives.

12:34.687 --> 12:38.858
Fail me and it's
level 10 punish!

12:43.028 --> 12:44.797
Master?

12:50.469 --> 12:52.271
What do you want?

12:52.338 --> 12:54.907
We thirst. We're so thirsty.

12:56.342 --> 12:58.711
Oh, dear!

12:58.777 --> 13:01.113
Shall I give you all a drink?

13:07.353 --> 13:09.388
No, Master! Please, Master!

13:12.658 --> 13:15.127
No! Water burns, water burns!

13:18.531 --> 13:20.566
You get the message?

13:21.233 --> 13:22.868
Work!

13:29.575 --> 13:33.512
Luke! Oh, Sky! Oh!

13:33.579 --> 13:36.849
Come on!
Listen, I've got a plan.

13:36.916 --> 13:39.251
But first we need to get
that pen away from Harrison.

13:39.318 --> 13:41.520
-SKY: We've got that covered.
-What? How?

13:41.587 --> 13:43.522
You've got gifted kids.

13:43.589 --> 13:44.990
Hi.

13:48.327 --> 13:50.229
Can I just check that for you?

13:50.296 --> 13:52.932
That's lovely, thank you.

13:53.132 --> 13:56.702
Right, just in time.
Now, where is he,
where is Harrison?

13:58.304 --> 14:00.739
-He's over there.
-Oh.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.641
Oh, he doesn't look like much.

14:02.708 --> 14:05.411
CLYDE: What's his
pen got to do with it?

14:15.254 --> 14:17.823
Oh, there we go. Top pocket.

14:27.633 --> 14:29.868
Ready, ready, ready!
Near time, near time!

14:32.671 --> 14:34.607
Oh, this place is terrible.

14:34.673 --> 14:36.508
-The smell!
-But look.

14:38.377 --> 14:42.147
-They got the message!
-Wow,
you are gifted, aren't you?

14:42.214 --> 14:43.916
No, no! Go, go, go!

14:43.983 --> 14:45.718
It's okay.
We're going to help you.

14:45.784 --> 14:47.419
No help! Master punish!

14:47.486 --> 14:49.822
Not for much longer.
Leave it to Clyde and Rani!

14:49.888 --> 14:52.024
SKY: What then?

14:52.091 --> 14:55.461
Well, your gifted mum's
got that covered.
Or she will have. Wait here.

14:55.527 --> 14:57.730
Adriana,
I need something from you.

14:59.665 --> 15:01.934
Right. Here goes.

15:03.902 --> 15:07.106
Hello, hello! New faces,
good to see you.

15:07.172 --> 15:11.310
-Keeps me young.
Lionel Carson.
-Trevor. Call me Trev.

15:11.377 --> 15:14.380
Meet Janet,
the trouble and strife.

15:14.446 --> 15:17.082
Oh,
Trev, my old ball and chain.

15:17.149 --> 15:19.285
You're from <i>Twilight Years.</i>

15:19.351 --> 15:22.621
-What?
-New approach.
We're the voice of youth.

15:22.688 --> 15:25.824
We're opinion formers.
We give a stairlift
a five-star review

15:25.891 --> 15:28.260
and watch the sales rocket.

15:28.327 --> 15:31.030
Rocket in a very
steady and safe way.

15:31.096 --> 15:33.732
Yeah, wouldn't want to
give our readers
any big shocks.

15:33.799 --> 15:37.469
There aren't enough stars
in the skies for
the Serf Board.

15:37.536 --> 15:39.672
Everyone will love it.
I know you will.

15:39.738 --> 15:41.540
(MOBILE PHONE BEEPS)

15:43.942 --> 15:48.580
Escaped?
Well, then find her, now!

15:48.647 --> 15:52.117
Mr Harrison, isn't it?
Janet Sharp, <i>Twilight Years.</i>

15:52.184 --> 15:53.952
Do you mind if I
grab a quick word?

15:56.355 --> 15:59.158
Mr Carson, can I borrow a pen?

15:59.224 --> 16:01.093
-Help yourself.
-Thank you.

16:07.466 --> 16:11.036
Send that
message now, Mr Smith.
Urgent, rescue flight needed.

16:11.103 --> 16:13.105
Coordinates, roof
of the Serf Systems compound.

16:14.373 --> 16:16.108
Yeah.

16:18.077 --> 16:21.714
MR SMITH:
<i>Earth calling Skultos.</i>
<i>Light Sculptors imprisoned.</i>

16:21.780 --> 16:24.350
<i>Dispatch rescue</i>
<i>vehicle immediately,</i>

16:24.416 --> 16:26.852
<i>urgent, to these coordinates.</i>

16:31.190 --> 16:33.692
RANI: That is amazing.
Oh, bum!

16:33.759 --> 16:36.395
-Pen's run out,
can I borrow yours?
-Uh...

16:36.462 --> 16:40.999
Yes, here. Look, keep it.
Thank you, I've got to go,
it's almost time.

16:41.066 --> 16:42.868
-Oh!
-Sorry, mate.

16:45.771 --> 16:47.506
Waste of time.

16:49.074 --> 16:50.909
Three cheers for
the old switcheroo.

16:55.180 --> 16:57.383
-He did it!
-Right! They're free!

16:59.618 --> 17:00.552
Free!

17:00.619 --> 17:02.588
Free, free!

17:02.654 --> 17:04.623
Free, free!

17:04.690 --> 17:07.393
-Clyde's got the pen!
-Oh, brilliant!

17:07.459 --> 17:10.561
Plark, come with me.
Bring your people
up to the roof, quickly.

17:10.628 --> 17:12.464
Rescue's on its way!

17:12.531 --> 17:14.867
Skultos. Home! Come on, now!

17:15.634 --> 17:18.871
Quick, follow us!

17:18.936 --> 17:21.306
You two stay here
and keep an eye on Harrison.

17:21.373 --> 17:22.808
-But...
-Mum's right, Sky.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.843
See you soon!

17:24.910 --> 17:27.378
-Come on! Run!
-Run, run, run!

17:31.550 --> 17:35.087
<i>Hi, I'm Joseph Serf.</i>

17:35.154 --> 17:38.123
<i>I'm here to introduce</i>
<i>the Serf Board</i>
<i>from Serf Systems,</i>

17:38.190 --> 17:42.127
<i>the world's newest</i>
<i>and best portable computer.</i>

17:42.194 --> 17:44.530
<i>The 15th at 5pm.</i>

17:44.596 --> 17:46.131
A moment of history.

17:48.367 --> 17:50.202
But I don't get it,
it's just a pen.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.870
Don't play with it!

17:53.705 --> 17:55.607
Mine, I think, Janet!

17:57.142 --> 17:58.877
Enjoy the show.

18:02.581 --> 18:05.284
Get ready,
Plark, the time is now.

18:05.350 --> 18:08.520
HARRISON: <i>Just one mistake</i>
<i>and it's double 10.</i>

18:08.587 --> 18:10.856
No! He's got the pen back!

18:10.923 --> 18:12.758
SERF: <i>...from Serf Systems.</i>

18:12.825 --> 18:14.960
If the hologram doesn't obey,
he'll know something's wrong!

18:15.027 --> 18:17.896
He'll hurt them, he'll stop
them from getting away if we
don't do something.

18:19.298 --> 18:21.567
-We've got to work Serf.
-What?

18:21.633 --> 18:24.369
Come on! We've got to drag
the hologram ourselves!

18:29.775 --> 18:33.412
-Oh! Come on, come on!
-But they are free?

18:33.479 --> 18:35.848
Almost, Adriana. Almost.

18:37.716 --> 18:41.420
So, before we go through
to meet the Serf Board,

18:41.487 --> 18:45.591
let's meet the man
behind the Serf Board,

18:46.592 --> 18:48.527
Joseph Serf!

18:58.704 --> 19:01.874
(NERVOUS LAUGHTER) Um,
Mr Joseph Serf!

19:03.542 --> 19:06.011
-Ready?
-You bet!

19:06.078 --> 19:09.381
Serf! Now, now, now!

19:09.448 --> 19:11.783
Left leg. Right leg.
Left leg. Right leg.

19:15.354 --> 19:16.855
Walk! Walk!

19:21.493 --> 19:23.061
Fellow's been drinking.

19:35.073 --> 19:38.777
Welcome to my lovely lunch.

19:43.448 --> 19:45.417
My lovely launch.

19:49.855 --> 19:52.391
Oh, I am gorgeous.

19:52.457 --> 19:54.893
-He'd never say that!
-First thing I could think of!

19:59.898 --> 20:01.366
You keep him talking!

20:01.433 --> 20:03.936
What a beautiful day,
boys and girls.

20:07.139 --> 20:08.874
Remember, he's American!

20:09.942 --> 20:11.710
Yee-ha!

20:13.612 --> 20:16.748
As I woke up, put my grits
on the griddle, I thought,

20:16.815 --> 20:21.386
"Gee,
what a cotton-pickin' day
to launch a new computer!"

20:21.453 --> 20:23.889
What? What?
You've been
watching <i>Toy Story</i> again.

20:28.193 --> 20:30.395
He's gonna use the pen. No!

20:33.332 --> 20:35.934
(ALL SCREAMING)

20:39.871 --> 20:42.507
The pen. Get the pen.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.850
He's hypnotic.
We've got to turn
up the hypno-power.

20:56.688 --> 21:01.159
Listen, everybody.
I want you to
grab the pen from Harrison.

21:01.226 --> 21:02.861
Grab the pen from him!

21:06.064 --> 21:08.900
I say, that's not on!
Leave her alone!

21:12.738 --> 21:15.307
Smash it! Smash it!

21:15.374 --> 21:17.376
Smash it! Smash it!

21:19.478 --> 21:21.713
No! No! No!

21:26.184 --> 21:27.853
It's stopped.

21:29.788 --> 21:33.191
Go home.
The Serf Board is rubbish!

21:33.258 --> 21:36.662
Bog-standard cobblers!
Garbage!

21:36.728 --> 21:38.163
Go home. Tell everyone!

21:38.230 --> 21:42.968
-No!
-Of course it is.
Stupid computers.

21:43.035 --> 21:45.771
Nothing wrong with
a typewriter, says I.

21:47.239 --> 21:50.642
It's grade-A, 100% toot!

21:50.709 --> 21:53.345
It's bobbins. It's trash.

21:53.412 --> 21:57.949
In fact,
you think it's rubbish,
go home, tell everyone!

21:58.016 --> 21:59.785
I've got a weird
feeling about him.

22:01.086 --> 22:02.521
Hi, Clani!

22:02.721 --> 22:04.756
(LAUGHING) I knew it!

22:06.591 --> 22:08.126
(LAUGHING)

22:08.193 --> 22:09.861
Go to the roof.

22:11.530 --> 22:12.864
Bye, Clani!

22:18.937 --> 22:19.971
We did it!

22:20.038 --> 22:21.773
Where's Harrison?

22:24.076 --> 22:27.379
Sarah Jane Smith!
Step away from them!

22:27.446 --> 22:29.147
You're too late.
I said I'd stop you!

22:29.214 --> 22:30.882
You and whose army?

22:30.949 --> 22:32.784
-(RUMBLING ABOVE)
-Ha! That army!

22:43.795 --> 22:45.997
We go now.
Thank you, thank you!

22:48.033 --> 22:49.701
You good people!

22:50.902 --> 22:52.838
I think that's your ride.

22:53.538 --> 22:54.873
Quick! Come on!

23:03.381 --> 23:05.150
(ALL SQUEAKING EXCITEDLY)

23:05.217 --> 23:06.418
Home!

23:08.053 --> 23:11.022
No! I paid billions! No!

23:11.089 --> 23:14.626
-No, no, wait!
-You belong to me!
You're mine, mine!

23:18.396 --> 23:19.598
Yes!

23:28.173 --> 23:31.109
-That was a spaceship.
-What will they
do to Harrison?

23:31.176 --> 23:34.679
-Set him to work, I hope.
-That is amazing, amazing!

23:34.746 --> 23:36.848
Uh, who's this again?

23:36.915 --> 23:41.686
I'm just the cleaner. I mean,
I was the cleaner.
I have no job now.

23:41.753 --> 23:44.523
So you people,
you do this all the time?

23:44.589 --> 23:47.392
-That's wonderful!
-Give this lot a call.

23:47.459 --> 23:48.827
Mention my name.

23:48.894 --> 23:50.462
You're just the kind of agent
they need nowadays.

23:50.529 --> 23:51.997
Put them back on
the right track.

23:52.063 --> 23:54.866
And the pay will be very good,
I'll make sure of that.

23:57.435 --> 24:00.005
<i>The Serf Board has failed</i>
<i>to live up the hype.</i>

24:00.071 --> 24:01.907
<i>And Joseph Serf</i>

24:01.973 --> 24:04.843
<i>-after the most</i>
<i>disappointing launch...</i>
-That's enough, Mr Smith.

24:04.910 --> 24:07.012
Well, I'm
certainly not disappointed.

Oh, poor Mr Serf.
The real Mr Serf.

Nobody will ever know
what really happened to him.

24:14.586 --> 24:16.822
Done it.

24:16.888 --> 24:19.825
Oh, Sky, could you get me
that CD you
promised me, please?

24:19.891 --> 24:21.660
Sure, won't be a second.

24:26.097 --> 24:27.866
-What are you two up to?
-Nothing.

24:29.634 --> 24:31.536
Sorry, Sarah Jane,
it's a family thing.

24:38.910 --> 24:41.446
-Hi, Sky.
-What's going on?

24:41.513 --> 24:43.849
Present for you.
I got Clyde to do it.

24:44.916 --> 24:46.117
For me?

24:46.184 --> 24:48.153
Well,
it's your room, isn't it?

24:48.220 --> 24:51.156
-It's great!
-Nothing's too
good for my sister.

24:51.690 --> 24:53.458
Come here.

25:05.136 --> 25:07.873
<i>I have learnt</i>
