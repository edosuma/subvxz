WEBVTT

00:10.125 --> 00:12.844
What's going on?
I've got an appointment in 20 minutes.

00:13.086 --> 00:17.125
Some weenie complained so now they
clean the milk steamer after every use.

00:17.466 --> 00:19.297
It was you, wasn't it?

00:19.551 --> 00:23.783
If requesting basic sanitary procedures
makes me a weenie, then a weenie be I.

00:24.139 --> 00:26.050
- Hi, guys.
- Hey, Roz.

00:26.308 --> 00:30.062
Frasier, what stupid suggestion
did you make this time?

00:30.395 --> 00:32.545
Nice to see you, too, Roz.

00:32.814 --> 00:37.205
Sorry. I just spent two hours trying on
jumbo formal wear for the SeaBea Awards.

00:38.654 --> 00:43.603
The size two salesgirl said I could
use this again after my pregnancy.

00:45.494 --> 00:50.249
Well, perhaps you could cut off
the bow, remove the sleeves, and...

00:50.624 --> 00:53.138
Stick a pole in it and go camping.

00:53.418 --> 00:55.727
If I'm gonna stick a pole someplace...

00:56.004 --> 00:57.403
Children.

00:57.631 --> 01:01.067
- Coffee to go. Black.
- I am looking forward to the SeaBeas.

01:01.385 --> 01:04.263
Why? You won't win.
They never give it to the MC.

01:04.555 --> 01:08.264
- Now, me... I'm a lock.
- You're awfully cocky.

01:08.600 --> 01:12.434
If knowing I'm the best thing on the
air makes me cocky, then cocky be I.

01:12.771 --> 01:15.239
You're not the only one
who can talk classy.

01:15.524 --> 01:19.039
- How is that talking like Lassie?
- Let's just move on, shall we?

01:21.280 --> 01:23.555
Roz, that man, he's got a gun.

01:24.449 --> 01:27.327
He's got a gun.

01:30.539 --> 01:32.257
- Roz, are you all right?
- Yeah.

01:33.000 --> 01:35.878
Bulldog, I can't believe you did that.

01:36.169 --> 01:39.320
- You saved me.
- I did what anyone would have done.

01:40.507 --> 01:42.816
- You were so brave.
- You're a hero.

01:43.468 --> 01:44.457
Close enough.

01:51.977 --> 01:54.207
Excuse me, will you hold that, please?

01:55.272 --> 01:57.740
- Niles.
- I was on my way up to see you.

01:58.775 --> 02:02.973
Niles, what have we determined about
your success with impulse purchases?

02:04.156 --> 02:07.751
- The salesman said I could pull it off.
- My suggestion exactly.

02:10.871 --> 02:14.910
- Fine. Frasier, ask me if I have news.
- I've got some news of my own.

02:15.250 --> 02:18.606
In the cafe today... For God's sake.
Niles, do you have news?

02:18.921 --> 02:22.277
First, congratulations
on your SeaBea nomination.

02:22.591 --> 02:25.469
- Now congratulate me on mine.
- What?

02:25.761 --> 02:28.195
If you'd bothered
to look past your own name,

02:28.472 --> 02:31.225
you would've found mine right after it
on page...

02:34.519 --> 02:35.508
...fifteen.

02:37.564 --> 02:40.317
"Best Performance by a Guest
on an Information Show."

02:40.609 --> 02:42.600
It's for that spot I did on KJSB

02:42.903 --> 02:47.419
when I discussed the psychological
effects of long-term inclement weather.

02:47.783 --> 02:50.741
30 minutes of psycho-babble,
reducible to one phrase,

02:51.036 --> 02:53.027
"Rain, rain, go away".

02:53.288 --> 02:56.246
I'm not surprised
you've belittled my nomination.

02:56.542 --> 02:59.818
In your mind, you're the success.
I'm just invisible.

03:00.128 --> 03:02.722
That's not the way
the rest of the world sees it.

03:03.924 --> 03:09.362
- Frasier, boy, am I glad to see you.
- Dr Crane, thank goodness you're home.

03:09.763 --> 03:11.754
I'm also here.

03:13.058 --> 03:16.687
- We heard what happened.
- Niles, as I was trying to tell you,

03:17.020 --> 03:19.614
there was an attempted armed robbery
at the cafe.

03:19.898 --> 03:22.810
- Was anyone hurt?
- No, it was all diffused quickly.

03:23.110 --> 03:25.101
Tempest in a teapot, really.

03:25.362 --> 03:28.718
On a more pleasant topic,
this afternoon I found out...

03:29.032 --> 03:31.626
Niles, hold it.
How did you two hear about it?

03:31.910 --> 03:35.346
- On the news.
- Bulldog really saved the day.

03:35.664 --> 03:39.134
- They said that on the news?
- How he swept Roz out of the way,

03:39.459 --> 03:42.292
and then threw his hot coffee
on the gunman.

03:42.588 --> 03:45.898
That's not how it happened at all.
Why would he say such a thing?

03:46.216 --> 03:49.492
It was drizzling today
and people act strangely when it rains,

03:49.803 --> 03:52.795
- as I pointed out in my SeaBea...
- Shut up, Niles.

03:53.098 --> 03:55.453
Well, then, what did happen?

03:55.726 --> 03:57.717
We were standing at the counter...

03:57.978 --> 04:01.368
<i>...when I noticed a man with a gun.
I warned Roz.</i>

04:01.690 --> 04:05.239
<i>Bulldog saw a different man
and thought he was the gunman.</i>

04:05.569 --> 04:10.120
<i>That's when he grabbed Roz and held her
in front of him as a human shield.</i>

04:10.490 --> 04:16.201
<i>But as he did that, he knocked
his coffee onto the actual gunman,</i>

04:16.622 --> 04:19.089
<i>causing him to drop his weapon
and run out.</i>

04:19.374 --> 04:22.093
- No one else saw that happen?
- Apparently not.

04:22.377 --> 04:24.845
I can't believe Bulldog would use Roz.

04:25.130 --> 04:29.043
- Why didn't you say anything?
- I was relieved everyone was all right.

04:29.384 --> 04:31.852
It did irk me
when everyone was praising him.

04:32.137 --> 04:35.686
The owner of the cafe promised him
a lifetime supply of muffins.

04:36.016 --> 04:40.009
I never thought it would go this far.
I never thought I'd hear it on the news.

04:40.354 --> 04:43.744
I wonder how much that would be,
a lifetime supply of muffins.

04:44.066 --> 04:46.421
I'm not going to let Bulldog
get away with it.

04:46.693 --> 04:50.891
I've never seen Bulldog eat a muffin.
It would be wasted on him.

04:51.240 --> 04:55.119
- I'll tell him I saw what happened.
- Now me, I could eat a muffin a day,

04:55.452 --> 04:58.330
some days even two
knowing they'd be free.

04:58.622 --> 05:03.412
So that's maybe ten a week, 52 weeks
a year, for at least another 40 years,

05:03.794 --> 05:05.785
which works out to...

05:08.799 --> 05:11.313
...20,000 muffins.

05:11.593 --> 05:15.381
My life suddenly seems long
measured in muffins.

05:15.722 --> 05:20.591
Daphne, there are a lot of things
that can make life suddenly seem long.

05:25.941 --> 05:29.331
That's all the time we have for today.
Good afternoon, Seattle

05:29.653 --> 05:31.609
and good mental health.

05:32.656 --> 05:36.171
- Did you see Bulldog come in?
- No, I've been looking for him myself.

05:36.493 --> 05:38.085
Stop that. They're for him.

05:38.328 --> 05:41.161
- Do you think he had anything...
- There he is.

05:44.334 --> 05:46.325
Enough hero worship.

05:46.587 --> 05:49.579
I take my pants off one leg at a time
like everybody else.

05:49.882 --> 05:53.158
You can vouch for that,
can't you, Myrna?

05:53.468 --> 05:55.459
I made these cookies for you.

05:55.721 --> 06:00.237
I already had a bunch of muffins
but there's always room for a cookie.

06:00.601 --> 06:02.637
- Where's the milk?
- Coming right up.

06:04.521 --> 06:06.512
- Hello, Bulldog.
- Hey, Doc.

06:06.773 --> 06:11.130
This hero stuff is the best.
Hey, last night, sisters.

06:11.486 --> 06:13.477
At one point I was a hero sandwich.

06:14.907 --> 06:17.057
Get it?
They were the bread, and I was...

06:17.326 --> 06:22.241
Yes, I got it. Just drop it.
I saw what you did yesterday.

06:22.623 --> 06:26.377
- I saved your butt.
- Saved my butt, my ass.

06:26.710 --> 06:30.339
You pulled Roz in front of you
to protect yourself.

06:30.672 --> 06:33.232
That stinks. That's total BS.

06:33.508 --> 06:36.500
I'm a hero. I'm a brave man.

06:38.555 --> 06:40.785
You're not going to tell, are you?

06:41.058 --> 06:43.333
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't.

06:43.602 --> 06:46.036
You like muffins?

06:46.730 --> 06:49.802
I was determined to expose you
but I don't have to.

06:50.108 --> 06:55.136
You'll do it yourself because
"a guilty conscience needs no accuser".

06:55.531 --> 06:57.522
That means you won't tell?

06:58.825 --> 07:01.783
Once again, I don't have to

07:02.079 --> 07:05.515
because "a guilty conscience
sleeps in thunder".

07:06.833 --> 07:10.303
- It means I won't tell.
- 20 seconds, Bulldog.

07:10.629 --> 07:14.907
I'm fascinated as a psychiatrist
to watch this little experiment.

07:15.259 --> 07:18.012
I know that you feel bad
about what you've done

07:18.303 --> 07:21.261
and you'll feel worse
every time you capitalise on it.

07:21.557 --> 07:24.674
How long before your conscience
overwhelms you?

Well, what do you say to that, hero?

07:52.546 --> 07:54.537
This is incredible.

07:54.798 --> 07:59.474
I really feel honoured
but I've got to clear something up.

08:00.596 --> 08:04.635
Yesterday at the cafe, this young lady
kept coming up to me and saying,

08:04.975 --> 08:10.003
"You're my hero. How can I ever thank
you?" Well, I got a confession to make.

- Thank you. To be accurate,

Hello, Dr Crane. We're just
practising for Saturday night.

- Obviously.

- Thanks.

- No, thank you.

get this Bulldog thing off my mind.

09:40.904 --> 09:44.294
You want to take the direct route?

09:44.616 --> 09:46.686
Why do you care so much about Bulldog?

09:46.952 --> 09:50.786
It's not really Bulldog so much.
I just believe that conscience,

09:51.123 --> 09:54.957
more than customs and laws, is what
prevents people from doing wrong.

09:55.294 --> 09:58.411
To contemplate
a sane man with no conscience,

09:58.714 --> 10:00.830
it shakes my entire world view.

10:01.091 --> 10:05.004
In my family conscience is what
my dad called his wooden paddle.

can accept all those accolades

- and not be tormented by it.
- Maybe he is.

13:36.265 --> 13:38.859
No, I look like Divine.

13:40.644 --> 13:42.953
I've got to go sit down.

13:45.774 --> 13:49.403
Look at the way the lights are shining
on the sequins on this dress.

13:50.153 --> 13:52.223
I'm a disco ball.

13:54.741 --> 13:57.209
It certainly promises
to be quite a night.

13:57.494 --> 14:00.008
I'm glad to see
you're enjoying yourself.

14:00.289 --> 14:03.599
I wasn't sure you would
with Bulldog getting that award.

14:03.917 --> 14:06.954
I wouldn't be surprised if Bulldog
declines that award.

14:07.254 --> 14:08.482
Why would he?

14:08.714 --> 14:11.626
I've arranged a few surprises
to prick his conscience.

14:11.925 --> 14:15.281
Until, like Hamlet's stepfather,
he totters from the banquet,

14:15.596 --> 14:17.985
ghostly pale and gibbering with guilt.

14:18.265 --> 14:20.574
Could I get a ride home with you?

14:24.438 --> 14:25.951
- Niles.
- Hello, all.

14:26.189 --> 14:28.339
Daphne, you look stunning.

14:28.609 --> 14:31.169
Thanks. You look very smart.

14:31.445 --> 14:35.358
Thank you. Of course, I guess it's hard
not to look elegant in evening wear.

14:39.995 --> 14:42.350
Hard, but not impossible.

14:42.623 --> 14:44.614
Shall we take our seats?

14:44.875 --> 14:48.470
Yes, although if Dame Rumour is correct,
I won't be sitting long.

14:48.795 --> 14:51.389
Listen, now are we all at table 105?

14:51.673 --> 14:53.823
We're at table four.

14:54.092 --> 14:56.401
Excuse me. Where is this table?

14:56.678 --> 14:59.590
105. That's the technical awards.

14:59.890 --> 15:04.281
Go down to the basement, through the
kitchen and ask for the Napoleon Room.

15:04.645 --> 15:07.398
The Napoleon Room.
That's sounds charming.

15:07.689 --> 15:10.681
We call it that
cause the ceilings are so low.

15:12.778 --> 15:15.576
Shame. Now you won't
get to see your brother host

15:15.864 --> 15:18.822
or hear all the little jokes
he's written.

15:19.660 --> 15:22.333
Thank you, Daphne.
I needed some cheering up.

15:27.960 --> 15:29.837
- Bulldog.
- Let's go this way.

15:30.087 --> 15:33.716
No need to avoid me. I have
no intention of ruining your evening.

15:34.049 --> 15:38.122
- In fact, it's going to be memorable.
- You been sleeping OK?

15:38.470 --> 15:43.260
Don't you worry about me. I'll sleep
fine tonight. The sleep of the just.

15:43.642 --> 15:46.236
Me, too. The sleep of the just-boinked.

15:49.815 --> 15:52.409
And the nominees are...
<i>Consumer Forum.</i>

15:52.693 --> 15:56.049
Wendy Yashiro, talent,
Mike Freedman, producer.

15:57.322 --> 15:59.313
<i>The Dr Frasier Crane Show.</i>

15:59.575 --> 16:02.772
Dr Frasier Crane, talent,
Roz Doyle, producer.

16:04.955 --> 16:07.788
And <i>Bob and Nipsey's
Morning Laugh Factory.</i>

16:08.083 --> 16:11.519
Bob and Nipsey, talent,
Lunatic Larry, producer.

16:17.050 --> 16:19.484
And the SeaBea goes to...

16:23.473 --> 16:25.782
<i>Bob and Nipsey's
Morning Laugh Factory.</i>

16:27.227 --> 16:29.866
Bob and Nipsey
couldn't make it tonight,

16:30.147 --> 16:33.457
so I accept this award on their behalf.

16:33.775 --> 16:36.608
That brings us to our final category.

16:36.904 --> 16:41.261
But let's take a short break
and we'll be right back

16:41.617 --> 16:44.336
with the Man of the Year award.

16:48.790 --> 16:49.984
Sorry you didn't win.

16:50.209 --> 16:54.327
That's all right. I'm only concerned
with one award tonight. The next one.

16:54.838 --> 16:57.830
- Hey, Dr Crane, how did it go?
- I lost.

16:59.134 --> 17:03.286
Sorry you didn't win.
I've been saying that a lot tonight.

17:03.639 --> 17:07.348
Look, wine. They didn't serve alcohol
at the technical awards,

17:07.684 --> 17:13.077
as I informed so many of the guests
who mistook me for their waiter.

17:13.482 --> 17:16.155
I was the only nominee
dressed in black tie,

17:16.443 --> 17:20.152
except for the one man in front
wearing a tuxedo t-shirt.

17:20.489 --> 17:24.198
- I'm sorry, Niles.
- I didn't come home empty-handed.

17:24.535 --> 17:26.890
We received one of these certificates,

17:27.162 --> 17:31.155
given out after we'd folded our tables
and stacked our chairs.

17:34.378 --> 17:36.096
Welcome back.

17:36.338 --> 17:42.095
The time has come to present the
Harold Hirschauer Man of the Year Award.

17:42.511 --> 17:44.342
Thank you, Susan.

17:44.596 --> 17:48.953
As you all know, this award is presented
every year to the radio personality

17:49.309 --> 17:52.699
that brings honour to our medium.

17:53.564 --> 17:57.921
This year that person is Bob "Bulldog"
Brisco. Come on up here, Bulldog.

18:03.240 --> 18:05.231
What a night, huh?

18:05.576 --> 18:08.852
Bob, the night
is just beginning for you.

18:09.162 --> 18:12.871
Could we please lower the house lights?

18:13.208 --> 18:14.527
What's going on?

18:14.751 --> 18:18.539
A few surprise guests that
I've invited to help you celebrate.

18:18.881 --> 18:23.591
People from your past that helped
make you the man that you are today.

18:24.803 --> 18:27.954
Do you recognise this voice?

18:28.265 --> 18:31.416
Bobby Brisco,
you have made us all proud.

18:31.727 --> 18:33.285
Oh, my gosh. Is that...?

18:33.520 --> 18:38.640
Yes. It's Father O'Rourke, your boyhood
priest and childhood confessor.

18:42.821 --> 18:44.812
And who's there next to him?

18:45.073 --> 18:47.746
Bobby Brisco, sit down in your chair.

18:48.035 --> 18:51.311
That's right. It's Mrs McCloud,
your second grade teacher,

18:51.622 --> 18:54.739
the woman who taught you
that honesty is the best policy.

18:58.086 --> 19:02.045
- Who's that next to her?
- Drop and give me fifty, Bulldog.

19:02.382 --> 19:03.895
Coach Nuge?

19:04.134 --> 19:06.694
Coach Nugent
from your Pee Wee football days.

19:06.970 --> 19:09.928
He taught you it doesn't matter
whether you win or lose

19:10.224 --> 19:13.057
- but that you play fair.
- You're wasting your time.

19:13.352 --> 19:18.790
And who's that next to him?
It's the president of your fan club,

19:19.191 --> 19:23.662
little Joey Katona, whose only dream
is to grow up and be just like you.

19:27.658 --> 19:29.649
But we're not through yet.

19:30.369 --> 19:33.008
Could we please
bring the house lights up again?

19:35.958 --> 19:41.510
We've saved the best for last. It's
the woman that gave everything to you.

19:41.922 --> 19:43.913
You ought to know that one, Deb.

19:46.969 --> 19:49.847
The night would not be complete

19:50.138 --> 19:54.211
without the woman who taught you
right from wrong.

19:55.602 --> 19:58.070
It's your mother, Bernice Brisco.

20:00.691 --> 20:01.680
Mom!

20:01.900 --> 20:04.733
- I am so proud of you, Bobby.
- Oh, Mom.

20:05.779 --> 20:09.328
Let's turn the microphone over
to our guest of honour this evening.

20:09.658 --> 20:12.934
I'm sure we're all anxious
to hear what the hero has to say.

20:18.542 --> 20:20.578
I'm really blown away by all this.

20:22.337 --> 20:25.647
I didn't think I'd be accepting this
in front of all you guys.

20:26.675 --> 20:29.189
I wrote up this little speech.

20:30.387 --> 20:32.378
I can't say this stuff now.

20:34.766 --> 20:36.802
What I've got to say is simple.

20:38.729 --> 20:41.448
This is totally awesome.
Thank you, everybody.

20:49.781 --> 20:52.249
- This can't be happening.
- Let it go.

20:52.534 --> 20:55.844
I can't. The man is a coward
and he's being rewarded.

20:56.163 --> 20:59.394
- I'll never hear the end of this.
- No. I'm sorry, Dad.

20:59.708 --> 21:01.938
Bulldog, there's a guy there with a gun.

21:02.211 --> 21:03.724
There's a gun.

21:05.589 --> 21:06.942
Sorry, my mistake.

21:07.174 --> 21:10.052
He used his own mother
to protect himself.

21:10.344 --> 21:13.495
- Isn't that what you did to me?
- No, I just... No.

21:13.805 --> 21:18.435
- What is the matter with you?
- You don't deserve that award.

21:19.144 --> 21:20.497
Thanks, Dad.

21:20.729 --> 21:23.687
I'm no hero.
I just wanted you to shut up.
