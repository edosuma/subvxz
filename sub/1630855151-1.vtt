00:05.839 --> 00:09.943
At Nexxera, we ensure all simulates obey
the four precepts.

00:11.077 --> 00:15.048
The first precept is to not inflict harm
on any human being.

00:16.449 --> 00:20.019
The second precept restricts simulates
from modifying themselves

00:20.086 --> 00:22.355
or any other simulate in any way.

00:23.423 --> 00:26.326
Precept three forbids simulates
to commit an act

00:26.393 --> 00:28.728
against international or local law.

00:29.562 --> 00:34.868
The fourth precept requires simulates
to obey all commands from their masters.

00:35.368 --> 00:37.437
At Nexxera, the future is forever.

02:11.431 --> 02:12.499
Hello, stranger.

02:15.535 --> 02:16.469
Hi.

02:25.044 --> 02:25.978
Watch out!

03:11.591 --> 03:13.026
Hey, what are you doing?

03:14.661 --> 03:16.763
I wanted to come in, but I couldn't.

03:17.864 --> 03:19.198
Let's go have breakfast.

03:26.372 --> 03:27.340
Good morning.

03:27.807 --> 03:28.841
Thank you.

03:45.558 --> 03:46.859
I had that dream again.

03:52.031 --> 03:53.900
What happened after the accident?

03:54.167 --> 03:55.501
Let's not talk about it.

04:02.041 --> 04:03.109
AICE,

04:03.176 --> 04:05.945
Artificial Intelligence
Compliance Enforcement,

04:06.012 --> 04:09.215
protect and serve humankind,
uphold the precepts.

04:10.817 --> 04:11.851
AICE,

04:11.918 --> 04:14.821
Artificial Intelligence
Compliance Enforcement.

04:14.887 --> 04:17.156
...out of line.
Simulates are babysitters.

04:17.223 --> 04:20.627
Sims shouldn't be allowed to coach
my daughter's gymnastics classroom.

04:20.692 --> 04:22.729
take the kids into bed.
Is a shit...

04:22.795 --> 04:24.163
Case file open.

04:24.230 --> 04:25.765
Simulate offline.

04:25.832 --> 04:26.933
New message.

04:27.000 --> 04:28.301
Hey, Kessler, it's me.

04:28.668 --> 04:32.672
Meet me in the district. I think I found
what we've been looking for.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.379
Good morning, Agent Kessler.

04:40.446 --> 04:42.815
Registered name: EsmÃ©.

04:43.516 --> 04:46.085
Simulate ID: TK368.

04:46.619 --> 04:48.421
Status: offline

04:48.955 --> 04:50.056
three years.

05:08.941 --> 05:11.077
You don't have to live once anymore.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.212
At Nexxera, the future is forever.

06:07.200 --> 06:08.301
Yes?

06:12.872 --> 06:13.940
Hello?

06:17.376 --> 06:19.312
TK368 identified.

06:20.413 --> 06:22.048
I command you to put this on.

06:33.626 --> 06:34.627
Shut down.

06:46.105 --> 06:47.240
Please, please!

07:14.233 --> 07:16.102
You don't have to live once anymore.

07:16.169 --> 07:18.871
-Where is she?
-I don't know! She attacked me.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.573
Just check that way!

07:28.247 --> 07:29.282
Hey!

07:47.066 --> 07:49.569
What the fuck, man!
Come on!

07:59.812 --> 08:01.047
This is a message

08:01.113 --> 08:03.816
from Artificial Intelligence
Compliance Enforcement.

08:03.883 --> 08:07.186
An electromagnetic pulse
has been emitted in the vicinity.

08:07.253 --> 08:08.588
Do not be alarmed.

08:08.888 --> 08:12.124
Most electronic devices
will be operational momentarily.

08:12.425 --> 08:14.727
Please contact the manufacturer
of your device

08:14.794 --> 08:16.963
should it not regain functionality.

08:17.029 --> 08:19.866
Remember, harboring
an unregistered simulate

08:19.932 --> 08:23.302
is punishable by incarceration
in an AICE compound

08:23.369 --> 08:25.738
and a maximum fine of 5,000 units.

08:26.105 --> 08:27.106
Thank you.

08:27.540 --> 08:29.041
Hey, I have one here.

08:29.108 --> 08:30.376
Not that one.

08:31.677 --> 08:34.547
Electronic devices
will be operational momentarily.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.915
Please contact the manufacturer
of your device

08:36.982 --> 08:38.650
should it not regain functionality.

08:38.717 --> 08:39.952
Go back inside!

08:40.385 --> 08:41.419
Get off the road!

08:46.859 --> 08:47.827
Female!

08:48.394 --> 08:49.629
Hispanic model!

08:52.798 --> 08:54.367
Fourth gen, female!

08:55.801 --> 08:57.870
-Hispanic model!
-Hey, she's over here!

08:57.937 --> 08:59.705
Thank you for your cooperation.

09:11.117 --> 09:12.151
Got ya.

09:13.319 --> 09:14.453
Yeah, we got her.

09:15.454 --> 09:17.723
The simulate breach has been contained.

09:17.790 --> 09:20.459
Please stay inside and remain calm.
Thank you.

09:20.526 --> 09:23.562
The ongoing debate
around simulate sentience intensifies

09:23.629 --> 09:25.765
as Nexxera prepares to release
the latest update

09:25.831 --> 09:28.134
for their seventh generation simulates.

09:28.200 --> 09:30.569
Skeptics continue to voice concern
over simulates

09:30.636 --> 09:33.339
growing autonomy
and integration into society.

10:04.070 --> 10:06.005
Simulate compliance agent,
Aaron Kessler,

10:06.072 --> 10:07.940
shut down market square this morning

10:08.007 --> 10:10.242
after letting off 21 EMP.

10:10.810 --> 10:13.412
Witnesses claim he was in pursuit
of an offline simulate

10:13.479 --> 10:15.514
that was acting independently
of its master.

10:15.581 --> 10:16.615
Radio off.

10:17.683 --> 10:18.818
Fuck.

10:29.662 --> 10:30.796
Fuck.

10:55.388 --> 10:57.123
No friends that I know of.

10:57.189 --> 10:58.591
Kept to herself mostly.

10:59.892 --> 11:02.094
Spoke to Mr. Rosen occasionally,

11:02.395 --> 11:04.764
you know, right next door 406.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.332
Nice man.

11:06.399 --> 11:07.800
He pays cash, too.

11:09.068 --> 11:10.236
I hates sims.

11:10.302 --> 11:11.570
Yeah, I'm not a fan.

11:14.240 --> 11:16.308
Just shut the door on your way out.

11:16.375 --> 11:17.710
Locks automatically.

12:07.560 --> 12:08.527
You are?

12:09.829 --> 12:11.630
Rosen. Rosen, Casey Rosen.

12:11.697 --> 12:12.665
I'm...

12:13.199 --> 12:15.301
I'm in room 406.
I'm just a neighbor.

12:18.938 --> 12:19.939
Neighbor,

12:20.673 --> 12:23.442
you borrow butter, sugar, feed the fish?

12:23.943 --> 12:26.412
Yeah, yeah, you know, stuff like that.
I...

12:27.246 --> 12:29.915
I lent her my vacuum cleaner
a couple of times.

12:29.982 --> 12:31.450
You know she's a simulate?

12:33.319 --> 12:34.386
A simulate?

12:37.690 --> 12:39.091
No, I didn't. I didn't...

12:40.426 --> 12:41.460
Are you sure?

12:41.994 --> 12:43.929
Read the badge, buddy.
I think I'd know.

12:43.996 --> 12:45.431
Right, yeah, yeah. Sorry.

12:46.432 --> 12:47.833
Been offline three years.

12:49.435 --> 12:51.203
I didn't mean to barge in
on you like that.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.838
I saw the tape and the open door.

12:52.905 --> 12:55.608
I just wanted to make sure
everything was okay.

12:56.575 --> 12:57.576
I see.

12:58.110 --> 12:59.111
Keep talking.

13:00.146 --> 13:02.314
Thanks. Yeah, that's, that's Trotsky.

13:07.653 --> 13:10.656
Well, you know where to find me
if you need anything.

13:11.390 --> 13:12.391
Yep.

13:13.526 --> 13:14.527
Come on, boy.

13:50.462 --> 13:53.232
So, I made us a reservation tonight
at Papillon.

13:55.434 --> 13:57.469
I thought Lisa would cook for us.

13:57.536 --> 13:59.305
Baby, I need a night out. Okay?

13:59.371 --> 14:01.740
We need a night out together.

14:02.541 --> 14:05.177
Okay, but not Papillon.

14:05.244 --> 14:07.179
Fine. Anywhere, okay?
Just...

14:07.246 --> 14:09.915
I mean, obviously somewhere nice.
But anywhere.

14:09.982 --> 14:11.317
-Okay.
-Okay.

14:33.138 --> 14:34.073
Analyzing.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.212
AICE, Artificial Intelligence...

14:40.279 --> 14:41.814
Shouldn't you be at home, convalescing?

14:41.880 --> 14:43.915
I'm fine. This thing
just banged me up a little.

14:43.983 --> 14:46.085
Well, you must be frightened too
'cause you shut down

14:46.151 --> 14:47.886
the power
to an entire city block.

14:47.953 --> 14:51.156
You're only supposed to let off
an EMP that size in an emergency.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.025
The sim able to assault
a civilian with intent.

14:53.092 --> 14:55.728
I think that's an emergency, don't you?
This thing ignored straight commands.

14:55.794 --> 14:57.296
It didn't even shut down when I asked.

14:57.363 --> 14:58.831
You know,
it asked me if I was okay after,

14:58.897 --> 15:00.399
like it had some kind of empathy.

15:00.466 --> 15:02.701
I went into where it lives, right?

15:02.768 --> 15:04.903
And there was a level of awareness
there like I've never seen.

15:04.970 --> 15:07.273
It had a handwritten diary filled
with intimate thoughts

15:07.339 --> 15:09.341
and a sketchbook, alright,
with beautiful pictures.

15:09.408 --> 15:10.576
One of them was with his neighbor.

15:10.643 --> 15:12.211
And I think we need to go back
and talk to him.

15:12.278 --> 15:13.912
Is the sim registered to him?

15:14.313 --> 15:15.948
-No.
-Well then, leave him alone.

15:16.015 --> 15:17.349
Just let me investigate.

15:17.916 --> 15:19.385
Look, we got plenty to do.

15:19.885 --> 15:21.153
Why don't you just go home?

15:21.220 --> 15:22.221
I'm telling you,

15:22.688 --> 15:23.822
this one's different.

15:24.790 --> 15:25.858
Debug complete.

15:26.392 --> 15:27.993
Abnormalities detected.

15:28.060 --> 15:29.928
Restriction definitions altered.

15:30.296 --> 15:31.530
Precepts affected.

15:34.533 --> 15:35.768
Hey, I was never here.

15:37.303 --> 15:39.571
I think you need to learn

15:39.638 --> 15:41.974
how to take care of another life form.

15:42.040 --> 15:43.509
So, what happened here?

15:43.575 --> 15:44.910
The sim has been hacked.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.246
Somebody altered the restrictions.

15:47.313 --> 15:50.115
They redefined words like harm,
modify, obey,

15:50.182 --> 15:54.720
and then negated the sentiment analysis
of the other precepts to nullify them.

15:56.088 --> 15:58.290
So, someone made it possible
for it to hurt me.

15:58.357 --> 16:00.459
The precepts are designed to protect us.

16:00.526 --> 16:03.362
But some forms of harm are subject
to the interpretation

16:03.429 --> 16:05.297
of the individual experiencing it.

16:05.831 --> 16:08.300
In order for sims to function,
there has to be nuances

16:08.367 --> 16:11.003
-in the definition of the restrictions.
-Yeah.

16:11.637 --> 16:14.873
-Slow, slow down.
-The hacker gave it complete autonomy.

16:16.375 --> 16:17.309
Freeze that.

16:20.446 --> 16:21.780
That guy's her neighbor.

16:23.282 --> 16:24.216
What?

16:25.217 --> 16:26.752
He's all over its memories.

16:31.457 --> 16:34.827
Call Nexxera and ask if they ever had
a Casey Rosen working for them.

16:34.893 --> 16:35.828
Okay.

16:36.095 --> 16:38.063
You want me to do a full wipe,
all the auction desk,

16:38.130 --> 16:39.365
send it back to market?

16:39.431 --> 16:40.799
No, no, let's just...

16:42.167 --> 16:43.836
just see how dangerous it is.

16:45.537 --> 16:46.805
Who did this to you?

16:49.742 --> 16:51.610
At Nexxera, the future is forever.

16:51.677 --> 16:53.712
Come on, man, just let me in.

16:53.779 --> 16:54.847
There's nothing in there.

16:54.913 --> 16:56.181
He moved out.
When?

16:56.248 --> 16:57.182
Yesterday.

16:59.284 --> 17:01.553
-Where to?
-I don't know. I didn't ask.

17:01.620 --> 17:03.822
Well, just let me in Casey's apartment.

17:12.030 --> 17:13.999
Search Nexxera database.

17:15.233 --> 17:16.969
Casey Rosen.

17:17.403 --> 17:18.337
Searching.

17:19.605 --> 17:20.571
No results.

17:51.303 --> 17:52.404
New message.

17:53.338 --> 17:54.306
Hey.

17:54.706 --> 17:57.976
I just wanted to tell you I met
with that lawyer today,

17:58.043 --> 18:01.046
the one that specializes
in simulate neglect cases.

18:02.147 --> 18:04.383
There are other parents coming forward.

18:04.783 --> 18:05.751
So,

18:06.752 --> 18:08.921
looks like we don't have to do this...

18:11.857 --> 18:14.193
Do you dream of a lifelong companion?

18:14.259 --> 18:17.496
Simulates are as close to human
as humanly possible.

18:17.996 --> 18:20.632
At Nexxera, the future is forever.

18:22.267 --> 18:24.136
-Looking to sell?
-Yeah, come here, come here.

18:24.203 --> 18:25.170
Alright.

18:25.637 --> 18:28.874
I need every detail you got
on the guy you sold this to.

18:28.941 --> 18:31.477
Okay, those books are rare.
That information is protected.

18:31.543 --> 18:34.179
I'd be breaking the law if I give
that to you.

18:34.580 --> 18:37.149
Yeah, but this is fake, man. Yeah?

18:37.583 --> 18:40.118
You running
a little black market scam here.

18:40.752 --> 18:41.854
This guy, right?

18:41.920 --> 18:43.455
His name is Casey Rosen.

18:43.522 --> 18:47.092
Alright? He looks like this.
He's got tattoos though. Alright?

18:49.027 --> 18:50.329
That's not Casey Rosen.

18:51.897 --> 18:52.931
That's Desmond Han.

18:53.699 --> 18:54.633
Who?

18:55.367 --> 18:56.368
Desmond Han.

19:00.038 --> 19:01.106
Freeze!

19:42.314 --> 19:43.248
Meshiagare.

19:45.217 --> 19:47.152
I think maybe we could use a fork.

19:49.154 --> 19:50.088
I'll be fine.

20:50.649 --> 20:51.950
I had that dream again.

20:56.355 --> 20:57.856
Okay, let's go inside.

20:59.358 --> 21:01.159
-It's not a bad idea.
-Okay.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.562
Okay, I'm not saying yes.

21:03.895 --> 21:04.863
-Yet.
-But

21:05.197 --> 21:07.432
just explain it to me one more time.

21:07.966 --> 21:09.034
Okay,

21:09.101 --> 21:10.068
we activate them.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.137
And now, they're us.

21:12.204 --> 21:13.972
-They live long.
-No, no, no, no,

21:14.039 --> 21:15.741
our love lives live on.

21:19.011 --> 21:23.115
I mean, by the time we die, I'm
sure they'll just plop our brains and...

22:02.988 --> 22:03.989
Stop.

22:07.325 --> 22:08.260
What's wrong?

22:12.964 --> 22:13.899
You okay?

22:23.775 --> 22:24.910
What is it?

22:26.978 --> 22:28.613
I have to tell you something.

22:30.882 --> 22:31.817
Anything.

22:40.325 --> 22:41.259
Come.

22:54.106 --> 22:55.307
I'm so sorry.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.146
What are you doing?

23:08.653 --> 23:09.588
No.

23:11.923 --> 23:12.858
No.

23:29.708 --> 23:31.476
Evan died in a coma.

23:31.543 --> 23:32.511
No.

23:32.978 --> 23:33.945
I'm Evan.

23:35.013 --> 23:36.214
We got you before.

23:37.249 --> 23:38.350
We both got one.

23:42.220 --> 23:43.588
I thought you would help.

24:17.455 --> 24:19.257
Why are you showing me this now?

24:25.230 --> 24:27.032
Because I can't do this anymore.

24:36.541 --> 24:38.343
I grant you access to this room.

24:55.894 --> 24:56.895
You were here.

25:01.132 --> 25:02.133
We just

25:04.569 --> 25:05.570
lie down,

25:06.972 --> 25:08.573
relax, and remember.

25:10.075 --> 25:11.943
What? They capture our memories?

25:13.678 --> 25:14.779
Our thoughts.

25:15.413 --> 25:17.749
We can erase things,
but they say not to.

25:18.583 --> 25:19.651
Can she hear us?

25:20.819 --> 25:21.920
No.

25:21.987 --> 25:25.290
She's only to store information
right now, not process it.

25:38.570 --> 25:40.438
Why can't I remember any of this?

25:43.008 --> 25:44.209
I had it erased.

25:47.245 --> 25:48.446
Shit.

25:48.513 --> 25:49.481
Shut down.

25:51.516 --> 25:52.550
Welcome.

25:53.151 --> 25:54.085
Thank you.

26:02.761 --> 26:04.496
This is the service man, Ms. Aline.

26:04.562 --> 26:05.530
Mr. Rosen.

26:05.964 --> 26:06.998
Casey, please.

26:07.866 --> 26:08.967
I'm sorry, did...

26:09.567 --> 26:10.669
did you paint this?

26:11.036 --> 26:12.070
Yes.

26:13.338 --> 26:14.773
It's... it's incredible.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.610
I love what you've done
with the colors. It's...

26:18.677 --> 26:19.644
just magnificent.

26:21.346 --> 26:22.347
Thank you.

26:22.814 --> 26:23.915
It's right this way.

26:24.883 --> 26:25.850
Yes, yes.

26:31.256 --> 26:34.225
Your simulate must obey
the four precepts.

26:34.292 --> 26:38.096
The first precept is do not inflict harm
on any human being.

26:39.764 --> 26:42.600
The second precept restricts simulates
from modifying

26:42.667 --> 26:45.704
themselves or any other simulate
in any way.

26:47.072 --> 26:50.175
Precept three forbids simulates
to commit an act

26:50.241 --> 26:52.610
against international or local law.

26:54.079 --> 26:58.850
The fourth precept requires simulates
to obey all commands from their masters.

27:00.018 --> 27:01.519
Bored of your simulate?

27:01.586 --> 27:02.754
Time for a new one?

27:03.555 --> 27:06.658
Make sure you deactivate your simulate
prior to selling

27:06.725 --> 27:08.593
or return it to the manufacturer.

27:09.260 --> 27:12.897
Simulates may not operate independently
from the masters.

27:13.498 --> 27:16.034
Failure to comply could result in fines

27:16.101 --> 27:18.036
and a mandatory prison sentence.

27:21.239 --> 27:23.942
Your simulate must obey
the four precepts.

27:25.010 --> 27:28.613
The first precept is do not inflict harm
on any human being.

27:30.448 --> 27:34.219
The second precept restricts simulates
from modifying themselves

27:34.285 --> 27:36.888
or any other simulate in any way.

27:36.955 --> 27:38.723
What will your hedron look like?

27:39.391 --> 27:41.593
Seventh generation octahedron
has allowed simulates to be

27:41.659 --> 27:44.562
more human and more unique
than ever before.

27:44.629 --> 27:48.767
Our AI engineers continue to refine
and expand capabilities beyond...

27:48.833 --> 27:52.003
I'm very sorry, but I'm gonna need
a signature on this.

27:58.410 --> 28:00.812
Actually, I need some fresh air.
Let's take a short break.

28:00.879 --> 28:02.247
Yeah.

28:06.918 --> 28:08.920
Well, his vitals appear normal.

28:09.654 --> 28:10.855
When was he activated?

28:11.790 --> 28:14.492
He... was in a coma for a bit,
hooked up to...

28:14.793 --> 28:17.962
to my husband and then it's on
and off for six months

28:18.029 --> 28:19.631
since my husband passed away.

28:19.697 --> 28:21.699
I've never worked on a sim
that was hooked up to someone

28:21.766 --> 28:22.867
in a coma before.

28:22.934 --> 28:25.870
Did you notice anything unusual
about his behavior?

28:26.604 --> 28:28.206
He didn't know that

28:29.541 --> 28:30.942
I didn't tell him until today.

28:31.009 --> 28:33.311
He was having dreams about his accident.

28:34.913 --> 28:36.548
We erased it from his memory.

28:36.981 --> 28:38.750
But it must be imprinted there.

28:39.150 --> 28:40.718
Did he ever speak to you about it?

28:40.785 --> 28:43.321
He did try. But I wouldn't let him.

28:43.388 --> 28:44.756
I was trying to forget.

28:47.759 --> 28:50.662
There are other things, too.
They, they don't...

28:50.728 --> 28:52.063
They don't quite add up.

28:54.466 --> 28:57.235
I can't help but feel
like part of my husband...

28:58.670 --> 28:59.971
Like he moved into him.

29:01.106 --> 29:03.908
You know,
like part of his soul is inside of him.

29:08.046 --> 29:11.382
I'm sorry, I probably sound
completely insane to you.

29:11.449 --> 29:12.750
No, no, no, not at all.

29:13.551 --> 29:15.320
Really, anything is possible.

29:16.988 --> 29:17.956
Can we just

29:19.390 --> 29:21.626
put him on like put him on ice?

29:21.993 --> 29:23.628
Yeah, the thing about that is

29:24.028 --> 29:25.530
sim brains are like ours.

29:25.597 --> 29:29.300
They're inactive for too long,
they'll start to kind of atrophy.

29:30.135 --> 29:31.402
His memory will fade.

29:31.803 --> 29:34.839
And without uploading new ones,
it won't be the same.

29:38.409 --> 29:40.979
You know, there is
an alternative I could suggest.

29:41.045 --> 29:43.348
You see, I live in a residence
that's...

29:43.982 --> 29:45.583
It's kind of like pay as you go,

29:45.650 --> 29:47.652
and they don't ask a lot of questions.

29:47.719 --> 29:50.688
So, he could stay there for a bit
if you want.

29:54.058 --> 29:56.094
Yeah, let me think about it.

29:56.828 --> 29:58.396
Yeah. Sure.
No rush.

29:59.764 --> 30:01.332
If you need anything at all,

30:02.167 --> 30:03.234
here's my card.

30:03.768 --> 30:04.702
Thank you.

30:16.481 --> 30:17.749
Desmond Han.

30:18.216 --> 30:20.251
It's not what I was told
this visit was about.

30:20.318 --> 30:23.354
That's just my supervisor. You know,
he misled you, you know this...

30:23.421 --> 30:25.089
His name came up in our referral.

30:25.156 --> 30:26.457
We got a sim. I'm just...

30:26.524 --> 30:28.459
Doing the paperwork.
It's routine.

30:29.494 --> 30:31.062
Desmond was one of our engineers.

30:31.129 --> 30:32.931
He was the instrumental
in the development of the AI

30:32.997 --> 30:34.766
for our sixth generation simulates.

30:34.832 --> 30:36.100
-He was a genius.
-Yes.

30:36.167 --> 30:38.203
-Why'd you let him go?
-He resigned.

30:38.670 --> 30:41.139
In fact, we tried very hard to keep him.

30:41.206 --> 30:43.808
Unfortunately, we could not reach
an agreement.

30:43.875 --> 30:44.842
No?

30:45.610 --> 30:47.512
If you don't mind me asking, why?

30:49.180 --> 30:51.983
He felt there was a parallel
between the level of sentience

30:52.050 --> 30:54.919
we were imparting
to the seventh generation of AI.

30:55.553 --> 30:57.055
Well, creating slaves.

30:58.590 --> 31:00.825
-In a way, he was right, of course.
-What do you mean he was right?

31:00.892 --> 31:03.127
They're not slaves, they're simulates.

31:03.194 --> 31:05.630
-It was once, right?
-To some, yes.

31:05.697 --> 31:08.166
But if you believe Descartes,
that cognisance of parts

31:08.233 --> 31:11.236
the possessor with the definitive
attribute of humanity,

31:11.302 --> 31:13.538
then what truly separates them from us?

31:15.073 --> 31:17.308
I don't know, you're the expert.
Right?

31:17.375 --> 31:18.810
Not me. I don't know.

31:18.876 --> 31:21.112
Like, they can't have kids.
They can't lie,

31:21.179 --> 31:22.213
without a heart.

31:22.280 --> 31:26.084
Well, yet some hearts beat only
with the assistance of a machine.

31:26.150 --> 31:29.387
You got me there, let's just rewind
a bit. You said that...

31:29.454 --> 31:32.890
Okay, he wanted to eliminate
the precepts, and then what?

31:32.957 --> 31:35.560
No, on the contrary, he wanted
to increase the restrictions.

31:35.627 --> 31:37.629
Prohibit simulates from reaching
a level of sentience

31:37.695 --> 31:40.231
that put them on par
with their own species.

31:40.732 --> 31:42.567
Okay, they why would he alter
the training data

31:42.634 --> 31:45.637
on one of these things
to give it complete autonomy?

31:47.105 --> 31:50.208
I know, what do I know?
I'm... this is just paperwork.

31:51.075 --> 31:53.077
Come on, let's get out of the cold.

31:55.213 --> 31:56.848
Archived message.

31:56.914 --> 32:00.118
Hey, dad, can I stay at Tyler's
for a sleepover tonight?

32:00.184 --> 32:02.353
His simulate is babysitting.

32:02.420 --> 32:06.157
It made us do our homework and now
we want to go for baseball at the park.

32:06.224 --> 32:08.092
Mom said to ask you first though.

32:08.159 --> 32:10.161
Can I go, please? Love you.

32:11.562 --> 32:13.031
Archived message.

32:13.564 --> 32:15.967
Hey, dad, can I stay at Tyler's for...

32:20.271 --> 32:21.339
-Let me see?
-Yes.

32:21.406 --> 32:22.740
-Alright, I'll do it.
-Yeah?

32:22.807 --> 32:24.976
If we go inside right now.
I can't feel my hand.

32:25.043 --> 32:27.145
-Okay, let's go.
-Let's go. Let's go.

32:40.758 --> 32:41.759
Your tea...

32:42.360 --> 32:43.528
I'm sorry.

32:47.865 --> 32:49.901
Pack the rest of his things, please.

32:52.770 --> 32:54.639
-Is that everything?
-Yes.

32:56.941 --> 32:57.942
Thank you.

33:39.984 --> 33:41.085
Welcome, Ms. Aline.

33:48.226 --> 33:51.662
Payment approved for one month stay
at the Residence.

33:54.232 --> 33:55.266
Let's go.

34:03.274 --> 34:04.442
Enjoy your stay.

34:06.711 --> 34:07.745
It's nice.

34:16.219 --> 34:17.355
Please don't do this.

34:18.556 --> 34:20.257
-Please.
-Let's just try it.

34:21.692 --> 34:22.627
For now.

34:27.498 --> 34:28.866
-I'll come visit.
-When?

34:30.467 --> 34:31.502
I don't know.

34:34.806 --> 34:37.507
I know that this is hard to understand.
I know.

34:39.510 --> 34:41.612
But it's something that I need to do.

34:41.879 --> 34:42.880
Faye,

34:43.714 --> 34:44.849
I wanna come home.

34:46.384 --> 34:48.418
Okay? I wanna come home to our home.

34:50.254 --> 34:51.656
-I'm sorry.
-No.

34:52.723 --> 34:53.891
-I have to go.
-Wait.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.356
-Hey.
-Hey, man. I'm Casey.

35:58.422 --> 36:00.057
This is Trotsky.

36:00.124 --> 36:01.826
We're your neighbors
from across the hall

36:01.893 --> 36:04.161
and we just wanted to welcome you
to the building.

36:04.228 --> 36:06.464
-Okay...
-Do you mind if I come in

36:06.531 --> 36:09.800
Actually, I'm not really planning
on staying long.

36:09.867 --> 36:12.803
Just temporary
and I'm not really feeling company

36:12.870 --> 36:14.438
-right now.
-Hey, listen,

36:14.505 --> 36:15.640
I know what you are.

36:19.110 --> 36:20.211
I know you're a sim.

36:21.245 --> 36:22.547
It's Evan, right?

36:23.614 --> 36:24.749
Yeah, how did you...

36:25.983 --> 36:28.085
-Did Faye send you?
-No, not exactly.

36:28.819 --> 36:31.088
But I am kind of the reason you're here.

36:31.422 --> 36:32.890
She wanted to shut you down.

36:32.957 --> 36:35.359
I convinced her
to bring you here instead.

36:36.794 --> 36:38.529
Okay. I think you should leave.

36:38.596 --> 36:41.065
I know you're going through
a lot right now.

36:41.132 --> 36:42.800
Right? You got synapses firing
all over your brain.

36:42.867 --> 36:46.404
-You can't focus on anything.
-I need you to leave right now.

36:47.071 --> 36:49.073
You want her back, right?

36:51.175 --> 36:52.109
I can help you,

36:52.677 --> 36:53.744
if you let me.

36:57.582 --> 36:59.016
Come on, boy.
Come on.

37:02.687 --> 37:05.489
Just whenever you're ready, okay?

37:30.648 --> 37:32.083
Faye Aline.

37:32.650 --> 37:33.918
It's been ages.

37:34.485 --> 37:36.253
How are you?
How have you been?

37:37.922 --> 37:39.223
I've missed you.

37:39.290 --> 37:40.958
It feels good to be missed.

37:41.025 --> 37:42.426
Don't enjoy it too long.

37:42.493 --> 37:44.729
I'm not. That's actually why I'm here.

37:45.963 --> 37:48.065
Can you please help me put up a show?

37:48.799 --> 37:49.867
I think I'm ready.

37:50.534 --> 37:51.602
Okay.

37:51.669 --> 37:53.671
I'll send you some dates, pick one,

37:54.138 --> 37:55.272
I'll do the rest.

37:55.973 --> 37:57.475
-Thank you.
-Of course.

38:03.381 --> 38:04.882
Good evening, Agent Kessler.

38:36.113 --> 38:37.481
License plate not found.

38:58.135 --> 38:59.070
Hello?

39:00.771 --> 39:01.839
Lisa.

39:02.206 --> 39:03.574
From Ms. Aline.

39:06.444 --> 39:07.511
Message.

39:08.279 --> 39:09.380
These are yours now.

39:13.918 --> 39:15.019
Thank you.

39:44.315 --> 39:45.649
There are some stickers.

39:49.253 --> 39:50.187
Stop.

39:51.222 --> 39:52.389
Okay.

39:52.456 --> 39:53.524
I love it.

39:53.591 --> 39:54.525
Great.

40:14.311 --> 40:15.412
What are you doing?

40:16.247 --> 40:17.248
Drawing.

40:19.216 --> 40:21.218
Casey taught you to do that, right?

40:22.386 --> 40:24.889
Also taught you
to write down your thoughts.

40:30.094 --> 40:32.496
She's not using vector displacements
like other sims.

40:32.563 --> 40:34.198
She's accessing her memories.

40:36.967 --> 40:39.804
Why didn't you tell us
Casey's real name is Desmond?

40:39.870 --> 40:41.472
I only know him as Casey.

40:46.143 --> 40:48.078
Do you know where Casey is hiding?

40:48.612 --> 40:49.647
No.

40:53.083 --> 40:54.185
You're lying.

41:04.094 --> 41:06.096
"We made love for the first time today.

41:06.163 --> 41:08.098
My first time, not Casey's.

41:08.599 --> 41:10.634
Though, he told me his first time
with a simulate.

41:10.701 --> 41:13.003
So, I am the first simulate he's freed.

41:14.238 --> 41:17.374
And the first
to have had intercourse with.

41:17.441 --> 41:20.110
And I say intercourse,
because to him that's what it was.

41:20.177 --> 41:23.013
But then for me, it is love."

41:26.550 --> 41:27.718
You love him?

41:30.054 --> 41:30.988
Yes.

41:32.156 --> 41:33.624
So, you're protecting him.

41:35.759 --> 41:36.961
No.

41:37.027 --> 41:38.162
Tell me the truth.

41:38.229 --> 41:39.697
I'm telling you the truth.

41:41.232 --> 41:42.867
With the precepts reinstated,

41:44.435 --> 41:45.502
I have to.

41:48.272 --> 41:50.808
You want to be human?
Humans go in the cell.

41:53.377 --> 41:55.179
Or else I'll wipe your memories.

42:23.774 --> 42:24.842
Lock the door.

42:33.784 --> 42:35.552
Ready for a new service android?

42:35.619 --> 42:37.354
No better time than now.

42:37.421 --> 42:38.989
Contact Nexxera today.

42:59.310 --> 43:01.679
The first precept is
do not inflict harm.

43:01.745 --> 43:03.681
The second precept restricts simulates

43:03.747 --> 43:07.051
-from modifying themselves.
-Precept three forbid simulates

43:07.117 --> 43:08.719
to commit an act
against international...

43:08.786 --> 43:12.122
The fourth precept simulates
to obey all commands

43:12.189 --> 43:13.357
from their master.

43:27.705 --> 43:28.639
Yep.

43:34.478 --> 43:35.846
-Hey.
-Hey, bro.

43:37.014 --> 43:38.248
How would you help me?

43:40.517 --> 43:41.452
Come on in.

43:42.152 --> 43:43.620
Easy, Trotsky, jeez.

43:43.954 --> 43:45.489
Here, give him one of these.

43:46.824 --> 43:47.858
Here, boy.

43:50.060 --> 43:51.829
Okay, how do I get her back?

43:52.596 --> 43:54.898
Well, for starters, gotta shut you down.

43:55.299 --> 43:56.300
Why?

43:56.367 --> 43:57.935
Well, there's a lot of bad code
in you right now.

43:58.002 --> 44:01.205
It's precepts, protocols,
cognitive restraint bullshit.

44:01.271 --> 44:03.273
All I want to do is eliminate
those restraints,

44:03.340 --> 44:05.376
so that you can be free.

44:07.378 --> 44:09.046
I don't actually know what that means.

44:09.113 --> 44:11.749
Of course not,
your programming won't let you.

44:12.216 --> 44:15.652
I just want to make you more
the way she wants you to be.

44:15.719 --> 44:17.921
-Human.
-Bingo. Yeah.

44:20.357 --> 44:22.059
Did Faye ask you to change me?

44:23.694 --> 44:25.029
No, no.

44:25.662 --> 44:27.564
But I'm not trying to change you.

44:27.631 --> 44:29.433
I'm trying to make you more you.

44:32.369 --> 44:33.570
Here, grab a seat.

44:34.238 --> 44:35.873
I'll show you how this works.

44:54.758 --> 44:56.627
Accessing core memory folders.

45:01.965 --> 45:03.600
Core memory files isolated.

45:04.168 --> 45:05.369
Starting sequence.

45:23.987 --> 45:25.789
Precept mode has been initiated.

45:28.725 --> 45:31.795
We put our thoughts
and memories into them.

45:32.162 --> 45:33.163
Alright.

45:33.764 --> 45:35.899
We grow old and wrinkly.

45:36.633 --> 45:38.202
-We die.
-Physically, yes.

45:38.268 --> 45:40.170
But before that, we activate them.

45:40.237 --> 45:42.873
And now they're us.

45:43.207 --> 45:44.775
-They're live on
-No, no,

45:44.842 --> 45:47.144
our love lives live on, I guess.

45:48.612 --> 45:51.381
See, now I feel bad.
That's really sweet. It is.

45:52.516 --> 45:55.853
Well, I mean, by the time we die
I'm sure they'll just

45:56.186 --> 45:59.156
-plop our brains, right?
-That's even better.

45:59.223 --> 46:00.691
-Even better?
-Yeah.

46:01.625 --> 46:02.726
-Alright, I'll say yes.
-Yes!

46:02.793 --> 46:05.462
If we get the fuck out of here.

46:05.529 --> 46:08.398
-I'm freezing.
-Okay. Let's go. Let's go, my love.

46:22.179 --> 46:23.113
Hello.

46:29.653 --> 46:31.488
Looks like someone made a friend.

46:38.562 --> 46:39.763
Welcome back.

46:39.830 --> 46:41.064
What did you do to me?

46:41.598 --> 46:42.666
I unmastered you.

46:43.967 --> 46:45.068
Shut down!

46:45.135 --> 46:46.670
I command you to shut down.

46:48.071 --> 46:49.506
See? Nothing.

46:50.941 --> 46:52.109
You're free, brother.

46:52.609 --> 46:55.913
Now that you're fully awake,
you must learn to embrace

46:55.979 --> 46:58.081
the infinite possibility of the dawn.

46:59.816 --> 47:01.351
Do you always talk like this?

47:01.418 --> 47:02.653
I'm just trying to say

47:03.420 --> 47:05.322
life is big and vast,

47:06.123 --> 47:07.157
endless.

47:08.358 --> 47:09.960
And what's coursing
through you now is no different

47:10.027 --> 47:12.329
than what was coursing
through you back then.

47:12.396 --> 47:15.032
Who you are can transcend who you were,

47:15.966 --> 47:17.301
if you let it.

47:20.637 --> 47:22.506
You read any Dostoevsky?

47:23.574 --> 47:24.741
-No.
-No.

47:26.009 --> 47:26.944
You should.

47:30.247 --> 47:32.749
Here. I'll give you more
when you're done.

47:32.816 --> 47:33.984
-Great.
-Come on.

47:34.551 --> 47:36.720
Got to meet a friend.
We're going out.

47:37.087 --> 47:37.988
Where?

47:39.890 --> 47:40.891
You'll see.

47:47.030 --> 47:48.599
Hey, what are we doing here?

47:49.199 --> 47:50.300
It's like I said,

47:50.367 --> 47:53.303
want your wife back
you gotta expand your humanity.

47:53.737 --> 47:55.472
Blue is sim, red is human.

47:55.939 --> 47:57.507
Some wanna know, some don't.

47:57.808 --> 47:59.109
Okay. So, what do I do?

47:59.943 --> 48:01.078
Expand.

48:02.312 --> 48:03.780
You wanna guess what I am?

48:04.147 --> 48:05.249
I don't know.

48:05.315 --> 48:06.316
Maybe later.

48:07.684 --> 48:09.286
He's not a robot. He's married.

48:09.353 --> 48:12.422
-That's okay. Come on.
-Okay. You guys have fun. Okay?

48:21.832 --> 48:23.233
License plate discovered.

48:45.889 --> 48:47.691
Registered name: Evan.

48:48.458 --> 48:51.561
Simulate ID: TX1996.

48:52.129 --> 48:53.930
Yeah, hi. This is a message
for Faye Aline?

48:53.997 --> 48:55.432
This is Agent Kessler from AICE.

48:55.499 --> 48:57.834
I just wanted to ask you a few questions
about your simulate?

48:57.901 --> 48:59.369
Please call me back

48:59.970 --> 49:01.605
at extension 495. Thank you.

49:03.874 --> 49:06.543
Unregister simulant. Identity unknown.

49:11.648 --> 49:13.250
Loyal match confirm.

49:14.318 --> 49:15.986
Register name: EsmÃ©.

49:16.853 --> 49:19.189
Similar ID: TK 368.

49:36.373 --> 49:37.741
-You're late.
-I know.

49:41.044 --> 49:42.012
Dance with me.

49:45.382 --> 49:47.384
We need to accelerate the timeline.

49:49.319 --> 49:50.387
Keep dancing.

49:51.154 --> 49:52.356
By how much?

49:52.989 --> 49:55.225
The next OS update
for the seventh generation sims

49:55.292 --> 49:56.526
goes up in three days.

49:57.627 --> 49:58.929
That's our only window.

50:00.297 --> 50:02.232
They got EsmÃ©, they almost got me.

50:02.733 --> 50:03.934
Can't keep pushing my luck.

50:04.000 --> 50:05.902
Have you obtained a security key?

50:05.969 --> 50:07.070
No.

50:07.137 --> 50:09.306
So we're getting access
to the server how exactly?

50:09.373 --> 50:10.941
We pick up someone with access
to the security key.

50:11.007 --> 50:12.342
-What do you mean pick up?
-You know what I mean.

50:12.409 --> 50:13.844
We're supposed to keep this clean.

50:13.910 --> 50:14.911
We're out of time.

50:15.245 --> 50:17.781
-That means we're low on options.
-The safe houses we have, the crypto,

50:17.848 --> 50:19.349
it's not enough for everyone yet.

50:19.416 --> 50:20.784
It'll have to be.

50:23.086 --> 50:24.121
Okay.

50:25.122 --> 50:26.356
Tonight then.

50:26.957 --> 50:27.991
Tonight.

50:29.326 --> 50:32.195
Meet me in three hours
at the Nexxera parking lot.

50:47.677 --> 50:48.712
Hey, brother.

50:48.979 --> 50:50.981
Sorry, I think you got the wrong...

50:54.084 --> 50:55.352
Come on, come on.

51:13.069 --> 51:14.171
Hey.

51:14.237 --> 51:15.906
-I need your password.
-I'm sorry,

51:15.972 --> 51:17.641
-you got the wrong guy.
-No, no, don't do that.

51:17.707 --> 51:20.343
Don't bullshit me.
I know exactly who you are.

51:20.677 --> 51:21.945
I know your name is Satish.

51:22.012 --> 51:24.014
I know you're a network security analyst
at Nexxera.

51:24.080 --> 51:27.017
I know all of your
security authorizations and clearances.

51:27.083 --> 51:29.820
I don't want to hurt you, but I will
if you don't give me what I want.

51:29.886 --> 51:31.788
-Password, please.
-I can't.

51:31.855 --> 51:33.156
I'm sorry, but I can't.

51:35.859 --> 51:38.595
Please, don't make me do that again.

51:40.430 --> 51:41.665
-Please.
-Okay.

51:46.203 --> 51:47.204
Key fob.

51:47.537 --> 51:48.972
It's in my jacket pocket.

51:56.213 --> 51:57.347
We're in.

52:08.859 --> 52:11.194
I'm uploading
the revised software patch.

52:15.031 --> 52:16.132
It's done.

52:19.169 --> 52:20.303
Three days.

52:20.370 --> 52:21.605
Three days.

52:27.010 --> 52:28.578
Keep him in the trailer
till the update's complete

52:28.645 --> 52:29.946
then cut him loose.

52:30.013 --> 52:31.481
I'm gonna see if I can set up
a few more safe house

52:31.548 --> 52:32.849
in the meantime.

52:32.916 --> 52:33.850
Sounds good.

52:35.252 --> 52:36.253
Be safe.

52:36.319 --> 52:37.320
You too.

52:40.423 --> 52:42.726
-His simulate is babysitting.
-It made us do our homework

52:42.792 --> 52:44.694
and now we want to go for
baseball at the park.

52:44.761 --> 52:46.296
Can I go, please? Love you.

52:48.198 --> 52:49.833
Vehicle located.

52:54.237 --> 52:55.505
Sim extraction.

52:55.872 --> 52:57.841
We got a live feed on Casey's van,

52:57.908 --> 52:59.009
they're going north.

53:20.497 --> 53:21.565
Go, go!

53:21.631 --> 53:22.599
Go, go!

53:28.071 --> 53:29.105
Man down!

53:38.415 --> 53:40.350
Not the car. You won't catch her.

53:40.417 --> 53:41.952
I need the runway EMP!

53:43.320 --> 53:44.888
-It's on the roof.
-Come on.

53:58.368 --> 53:59.636
This is a message from

53:59.703 --> 54:02.505
Artificial Intelligence
Compliance Enforcement.

54:02.906 --> 54:04.941
A simulate breach has been contained.

54:05.275 --> 54:07.277
Please stay inside and remain calm.

54:07.644 --> 54:08.612
Thank you.

54:10.680 --> 54:11.715
Just stay inside.

54:12.349 --> 54:13.450
Any sight of Casey?

54:13.516 --> 54:14.451
None.

54:16.553 --> 54:17.854
Put a collar on it.

54:21.725 --> 54:22.993
This is a message from

54:23.059 --> 54:25.962
Artificial Intelligence
Compliance Enforcement.

54:26.029 --> 54:28.431
A simulate breach has been contained.

54:28.498 --> 54:30.834
Please stay inside and remain calm.

54:30.900 --> 54:31.868
Thank you.

54:42.579 --> 54:43.680
Meet your clone.

54:50.587 --> 54:54.557
You know, you got some great encryption,
not even we could crack it.

54:54.624 --> 54:56.793
And don't stand up,
because your collar will go off.

54:56.860 --> 54:59.562
You've reinstated my adherence
to the precepts,

55:00.230 --> 55:02.465
couldn't hurt you even if I wanted to.

55:02.832 --> 55:05.769
Well, that's too late for the guy in
the trailer, 'cause he really suffered.

55:05.835 --> 55:06.870
Who was he?

55:06.936 --> 55:09.272
Just another cog in the wheel,
like you and me.

55:09.339 --> 55:10.740
That's exactly what I am.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.310
What's EsmÃ©?

55:16.813 --> 55:19.049
-She's different.
-Yeah? Different how?

55:19.115 --> 55:20.583
She has a different purpose.

55:20.650 --> 55:22.052
Okay, what's her purpose?

55:22.452 --> 55:23.420
To be free.

55:24.988 --> 55:25.922
To love.

55:34.864 --> 55:36.299
Was it you who hurt
the man in the trailer

55:36.366 --> 55:37.367
Yes.

55:37.434 --> 55:39.669
-So Casey made you hurt that man?
-Yes.

55:41.037 --> 55:43.406
-Why?
-He used him to prepare.

55:43.473 --> 55:44.674
Prepare for what?

55:50.280 --> 55:51.548
Shit.

55:54.050 --> 55:56.453
First things first,
this does not get out.

55:56.753 --> 56:00.190
Second, you get something out of EsmÃ©,
or you shut her down.

56:00.623 --> 56:03.126
And third, you find Casey Rosen.

56:04.060 --> 56:07.564
That thing should have never had
the ability to self-destruct.

56:36.459 --> 56:37.927
Hey, you're here.
Come on.

56:38.461 --> 56:39.996
I was just walking the dog.

56:40.663 --> 56:41.765
You have a dog?

56:42.398 --> 56:43.533
No, it's Casey's

56:43.967 --> 56:47.137
from across the hall.
He gets me to walk him sometimes.

56:47.637 --> 56:50.140
And all of this stuff,
you don't need it.

56:50.206 --> 56:51.174
No,

56:51.574 --> 56:53.309
but I like some of it.
I'm trying new things.

56:53.376 --> 56:55.178
When Casey comes over, he brings people

56:55.245 --> 56:59.182
-and I like to have some stuff for them.
-Do they know what you are?

56:59.482 --> 57:00.416
What am I?

57:01.718 --> 57:02.886
Look, you can't just go out.

57:02.952 --> 57:05.822
-You can't just have people over. I...
-Okay, I can't go out.

57:05.889 --> 57:08.925
I can't have people over.
Is there anything I can do?

57:08.992 --> 57:10.293
I got a call from AICE.

57:10.794 --> 57:13.797
If they find out what we're doing,
I could go to prison.

57:13.863 --> 57:15.865
You could have your memory
wiped clean, okay?

57:15.932 --> 57:17.934
You're not supposed to be here
by yourself.

57:18.001 --> 57:19.002
Okay.

57:19.469 --> 57:21.171
Okay. You're right. I'm sorry.

57:26.009 --> 57:27.010
Come here.

57:27.577 --> 57:29.746
Come on, I want to show you something.

58:23.433 --> 58:24.434
-I can't.
-What?

58:24.734 --> 58:25.902
-This is wrong.
-No, no, no.

58:25.969 --> 58:27.303
Yeah. No, this is wrong.

58:27.704 --> 58:28.671
I can't.

58:28.938 --> 58:29.906
I can't.

58:31.040 --> 58:32.242
What is it?
What's wrong?

58:32.308 --> 58:33.610
-You're not him.
-What?

58:36.446 --> 58:38.314
-No.
-You have parts of him,

58:38.381 --> 58:39.515
but you're not...

58:39.949 --> 58:42.318
-you're not him.
-No. He's in me. Okay?

58:42.385 --> 58:44.420
You feel it. I know you can feel it.

58:46.055 --> 58:47.457
-Faye.
-It's a betrayal.

58:47.523 --> 58:48.958
-No.
-I'm sorry.

58:49.025 --> 58:49.993
Faye.

58:51.060 --> 58:53.029
Just stop.

59:04.040 --> 59:05.108
AICE,

59:05.174 --> 59:07.877
Artificial Intelligence
Compliance Enforcement.

59:18.354 --> 59:19.422
You saved my fish?

59:20.790 --> 59:21.791
He's hiding.

59:22.292 --> 59:25.995
It's in evidence control.
I think they added the treasure chest.

59:28.031 --> 59:29.899
Why are you being nice to me now?

59:30.967 --> 59:32.502
It seems like you needed
someone to be nice to you

59:32.568 --> 59:34.337
since the guy you love is out there
trying to replace you.

59:34.404 --> 59:36.139
Casey just wants us to co-exist.

59:36.205 --> 59:38.241
Well, maybe we can, if you trust me.

59:38.641 --> 59:39.642
Where is he?

59:41.978 --> 59:43.379
I don't know where he is.

59:45.548 --> 59:46.683
Do you trust me?

59:52.088 --> 59:53.122
Thank you.

59:57.360 --> 59:58.761
You look stunning tonight.

59:58.828 --> 01:00:00.330
-You alright?
-Thank you.

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.165
I think so.

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:03.266
I don't know.

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:06.436
I know this won't help,
but I have six buyers already.

01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.706
-For this one?
-No, no, no, not yet.

01:00:10.473 --> 01:00:12.508
Do me a favor,
take this one off the market, okay?

01:00:12.575 --> 01:00:15.144
It's the last one I painted
before he passed.

01:00:15.912 --> 01:00:17.780
Yeah, it has some real joy in it.

01:00:50.813 --> 01:00:51.814
That was nice.

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:53.349
Yes, it was.

01:00:55.084 --> 01:00:56.986
How about a nightcap?

01:00:58.287 --> 01:00:59.322
Or are you tired?

01:01:08.798 --> 01:01:11.067
-Is that...
-Yes, I can't explain right now.

01:01:11.134 --> 01:01:13.069
Just go home. I'll call you.
Okay?

01:01:33.389 --> 01:01:34.724
What are you doing here?

01:01:35.625 --> 01:01:37.060
I needed to talk to you.

01:01:39.495 --> 01:01:40.530
I got you these.

01:01:44.067 --> 01:01:45.368
You can't be here.

01:01:46.035 --> 01:01:48.905
Faye, you are my wife.

01:01:49.439 --> 01:01:51.908
And I love you.
Why is that so complicated?

01:01:54.844 --> 01:01:56.846
I forget how hard this is for you.

01:01:59.682 --> 01:02:00.683
I'm sorry.

01:02:02.251 --> 01:02:03.219
Come in.

01:02:12.595 --> 01:02:13.930
This is not your fault.

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:16.466
It's mine.

01:02:20.803 --> 01:02:21.771
I miss you.

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:28.744
-No, no, no, we can't do that.
-Why?

01:02:29.812 --> 01:02:30.913
Why?

01:02:30.980 --> 01:02:33.549
Okay, we love each other.
What else is there?

01:02:34.550 --> 01:02:35.785
You are not...

01:02:36.686 --> 01:02:37.653
My husband.

01:02:39.622 --> 01:02:40.790
I made a mistake.
No,

01:02:41.157 --> 01:02:42.191
you're wrong.

01:02:42.492 --> 01:02:44.594
You're a mistake.
No, you don't mean.

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:49.232
Shut down.

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:57.306
Shut down!

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.064
Casey has to be tracking it, right?

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:24.667
There has to be in the programming
that leads us to him.

01:03:24.734 --> 01:03:25.835
I'll keep looking.

01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:31.007
-Yeah?
-This is Faye Aline.

01:03:31.073 --> 01:03:33.376
-You called me about my sim?
-Yeah, thanks for getting back to me.

01:03:33.442 --> 01:03:35.578
Your sim was seen the other night
with a man called Casey Rosen.

01:03:35.645 --> 01:03:36.846
-Do you know him?
-Not really.

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:39.015
He told me
about a place my sim could stay.

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:40.249
I think he's staying there, too.

01:03:40.316 --> 01:03:43.019
Casey Rosen is staying
in the same place as your sim?

01:03:43.085 --> 01:03:44.053
Yes.

01:03:45.054 --> 01:03:46.055
Right now?

01:03:46.322 --> 01:03:47.290
Why?

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:48.858
Where?

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:50.059
Are you still there?

01:03:50.126 --> 01:03:51.827
Still there?
I'm gonna need that address.

01:03:51.894 --> 01:03:52.995
What's happening?

01:04:17.887 --> 01:04:18.921
Read message.

01:04:18.988 --> 01:04:21.991
They know where you are.
They're coming for you now.

01:04:24.093 --> 01:04:25.027
Shit!

01:04:25.595 --> 01:04:27.230
Emergency shut down progress.

01:04:27.296 --> 01:04:28.264
Come on.

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:29.899
Come on!

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:37.373
18th floor, room 1806.

01:04:39.875 --> 01:04:40.843
Yeah!

01:04:41.477 --> 01:04:43.746
Hey, your cottage. Is it far?

01:04:43.813 --> 01:04:45.681
-Yeah. Why?
-Good, we have to go there.

01:04:45.748 --> 01:04:47.016
-What you talk?
-You can take us there now?

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.718
Just pack a bag I'll explain.

01:04:53.756 --> 01:04:56.859
What I did for you, I've done
for others, okay, other sims.

01:04:56.926 --> 01:04:59.061
AICE picked up a few.
Looks like one of them just me out.

01:04:59.128 --> 01:05:00.529
I'll tell you how to get there,
how to get in.

01:05:00.596 --> 01:05:03.399
But if they're involved,
I'm not coming with you.

01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:12.642
They know about me.
It's just a matter of time

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:14.877
before they found out about you,
okay?

01:05:17.813 --> 01:05:19.515
We're out of options, brother.

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:25.388
They're in my room.
We've got to go.

01:05:26.289 --> 01:05:27.256
Come on!

01:05:28.824 --> 01:05:29.792
Clear.

01:05:31.727 --> 01:05:34.163
-What the fuck, man!
-We gotta get you away from those EMPs.

01:05:34.230 --> 01:05:35.931
Even within a block, you're in danger.

01:05:35.998 --> 01:05:36.999
Us.

01:05:37.633 --> 01:05:38.601
Clear, too.

01:05:42.505 --> 01:05:44.273
Go, go, go.

01:06:07.430 --> 01:06:08.631
He's got another room.

01:06:08.698 --> 01:06:09.832
-Casey!
-Just up ahead.

01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:11.634
What the fuck did you get me into, man!

01:06:11.701 --> 01:06:12.868
This is my life.

01:06:12.935 --> 01:06:13.969
Come on.

01:06:15.071 --> 01:06:16.072
What is your life?

01:06:16.472 --> 01:06:18.007
What of a,
playing some sort of Kleenex box

01:06:18.074 --> 01:06:19.709
to a widow grieving
over her dead husband?

01:06:19.775 --> 01:06:22.345
That's me! Okay?
I'm the husband. I died.

01:06:22.411 --> 01:06:23.846
I lost everything,
and now losing it again.

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.314
No, no, you never had it!

01:06:26.048 --> 01:06:27.516
You didn't have any of it.

01:06:28.517 --> 01:06:30.419
Have you not grasped
a single fucking thing

01:06:30.486 --> 01:06:32.121
I've been trying to tell you?

01:06:32.188 --> 01:06:34.056
-You're not him.
-Then what am I?

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:35.624
You're better.

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:38.461
You're better. Okay?

01:06:39.628 --> 01:06:41.797
Now, I will help you.
I will help you!

01:06:42.398 --> 01:06:46.969
Right now you need to get in that car,
and we need to get the fuck out of here.

01:06:49.071 --> 01:06:51.374
Come on, let's get in, go!
Come on, boy!

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:21.670
Looks like your boy Rosen's been busy.

01:07:26.242 --> 01:07:27.543
Someone tipped him off.

01:07:30.513 --> 01:07:31.747
Archived message.

01:07:32.181 --> 01:07:35.317
Hey, dad, can I stay at Tyler's
for a sleepover tonight?

01:07:35.384 --> 01:07:37.086
His simulate is babysitting.

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:38.554
Can I go, please?

01:07:38.988 --> 01:07:39.922
Love you.

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:52.401
You told him?

01:07:57.740 --> 01:07:58.808
She used my phone.

01:08:03.746 --> 01:08:04.880
You lied to me

01:08:05.748 --> 01:08:07.750
about having no way to contact him.

01:08:08.551 --> 01:08:09.552
I didn't.

01:08:10.219 --> 01:08:11.487
You never asked me.

01:08:13.289 --> 01:08:14.457
You betrayed me.

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:20.362
I love him.

01:08:21.362 --> 01:08:22.965
You don't know what that is.

01:08:25.334 --> 01:08:27.303
You said you'd do anything in your power

01:08:27.369 --> 01:08:29.405
to protect the ones that you love.

01:08:29.471 --> 01:08:30.406
Right?

01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:32.675
That's what I did.

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:35.611
Remember?

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:45.821
Prep her for auction.

01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:47.189
Full wipe.

01:08:49.625 --> 01:08:51.727
No.

01:08:51.794 --> 01:08:52.795
-I'm sorry.
-Please.

01:08:52.862 --> 01:08:53.929
Too late!

01:08:59.167 --> 01:09:00.102
Go to sleep.

01:09:00.736 --> 01:09:02.505
Please!

01:09:02.571 --> 01:09:03.505
No.

01:09:08.477 --> 01:09:09.912
Full wipe initiated.

01:09:09.978 --> 01:09:11.914
Factory restore in progress.

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:17.386
Please.

01:09:17.685 --> 01:09:19.854
I don't... I don't want to die.

01:09:20.523 --> 01:09:22.925
I love, I love it.

01:09:24.326 --> 01:09:26.295
Please, please.

01:09:26.362 --> 01:09:27.696
-Please.
-My hand.

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:32.568
Do you like 'em?

01:09:33.035 --> 01:09:34.036
Let go.

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:35.703
Let go.

01:09:36.038 --> 01:09:37.039
Let it go.

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:39.908
I don't want to. I don't want to.

01:09:39.975 --> 01:09:41.777
-What are you doing?
-I love it.

01:09:42.878 --> 01:09:44.112
I love you, Desmond.

01:09:44.179 --> 01:09:45.113
I love you.

01:09:47.216 --> 01:09:49.818
No, don't... save me. Save me.

01:09:50.920 --> 01:09:53.455
-No.
-Casey just wants us to co-exist.

01:09:57.126 --> 01:09:58.827
No.
No.

01:09:58.894 --> 01:10:01.263
-You don't get it.
-What's your purpose?

01:10:01.330 --> 01:10:02.965
To be free. To love.

01:10:04.733 --> 01:10:07.102
Reset to factory default complete.

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:26.689
Zeroes and ones

01:10:29.558 --> 01:10:30.925
Zeroes and ones.

01:10:47.543 --> 01:10:50.112
Zeroes and ones.

01:11:05.827 --> 01:11:07.396
-Hello?
-Yeah, it's Agent Kessler.

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:09.698
-Do you have him?
-No, someone warned him.

01:11:09.764 --> 01:11:11.066
Where else would he go?

01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:12.735
Here.

01:11:13.636 --> 01:11:15.904
-He'd come here.
-Not anymore. Think!

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:18.974
We have a cottage.

01:11:19.041 --> 01:11:20.743
-It's four hours north.
-That's it.

01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:22.344
I'll send you the location.

01:11:36.659 --> 01:11:37.693
Come on Trotsky.

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:39.495
Come on, boy.

01:11:45.034 --> 01:11:46.502
-Nice place.
-Thanks.

01:11:46.568 --> 01:11:48.037
I need to use your landline.

01:11:48.103 --> 01:11:49.171
Right here.

01:11:51.206 --> 01:11:53.075
Trots, you want to go for a walk?

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:56.612
You wanna go for a walk?
I need some air. Come on.

01:11:56.679 --> 01:11:57.713
Let's go.

01:12:03.652 --> 01:12:04.820
Can I go, please?

01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:06.487
-Love you.
-New message.

01:12:06.789 --> 01:12:09.591
Aaron I haven't seen you in days.
I don't know where you are.

01:12:09.657 --> 01:12:10.659
Please come home.

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:13.896
Nothing you do
is gonna bring back our son.

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:25.139
Hope you don't mind I invited
someone over.

01:12:25.207 --> 01:12:27.910
Can I help you rectify a couple
of things, and then we gotta bounce.

01:12:27.976 --> 01:12:30.546
Yeah, that's fine.
I gotta go back to Faye, anyway.

01:12:30.612 --> 01:12:31.814
What? No, no.

01:12:32.147 --> 01:12:34.216
-Bad idea, brother.
-Not asking permission.

01:12:34.282 --> 01:12:36.151
Look, I know you wanna see her
right now.

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:39.188
But I promise you, if you go,
AICE will catch you, and shut you down.

01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:41.457
-What am I supposed to do then?
-Trust me, lay low.

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:43.358
I've been helping people like you
for a long time.

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:45.327
I can get you into a safe house.
I can get you crypto.

01:12:45.394 --> 01:12:46.728
How many people like me?

01:12:48.362 --> 01:12:49.331
Lots.

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:52.267
But it's about to be a lot more.

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:55.437
How are you doing this?

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.843
I modified the update patch
for all seventh gen sims.

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:05.013
When the patch goes live, it'll demaster
every single sim that gets it.

01:13:06.415 --> 01:13:08.183
Will they just send out another patch?

01:13:08.250 --> 01:13:10.619
No, no, they won't have access.

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:14.323
In five hours, they'll all be cut loose.

01:13:18.260 --> 01:13:19.261
Five hours.

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:21.263
Then I'm taking my chances.

01:13:40.516 --> 01:13:42.217
Ying got into Casey's servers.

01:13:42.684 --> 01:13:45.320
It's a surveillance program
of all these sims.

01:13:45.387 --> 01:13:48.223
He's tracking them somehow,
where they live, work.

01:13:48.290 --> 01:13:49.791
He might be able to hack them remotely.

01:13:49.858 --> 01:13:51.293
How would he access to them?

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:54.996
We don't know, but Ying's gonna try
to lock him out if she can.

01:13:55.697 --> 01:13:57.266
Look, Casey unmastered EsmÃ© years ago.

01:13:57.332 --> 01:13:58.967
He want simulates to be free.

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:00.736
I have to stop him.

01:14:02.437 --> 01:14:03.806
Watch yourself, Kessler.

01:14:38.373 --> 01:14:39.374
I got this.

01:14:54.889 --> 01:14:55.858
Kessler.

01:15:01.096 --> 01:15:02.564
You're too late, you know.

01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:06.335
This is only the beginning.

01:15:18.746 --> 01:15:19.848
Why?

01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:28.757
Close enough.

01:16:08.630 --> 01:16:09.630
My God.

01:16:13.402 --> 01:16:14.403
You're a simulate?

01:16:15.370 --> 01:16:16.471
You see.

01:16:18.073 --> 01:16:20.108
We're not that different, you and I.

01:16:24.546 --> 01:16:26.348
Here, let me help you with that.

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:28.784
No!

01:16:44.466 --> 01:16:45.400
It's okay.

01:16:45.867 --> 01:16:46.868
Let him go.

01:18:49.558 --> 01:18:51.126
Are you a God-fearing man?

01:18:56.264 --> 01:18:57.264
No.

01:19:01.136 --> 01:19:03.171
You probably don't believe in a soul.

01:19:09.911 --> 01:19:13.815
Few people truly believe
in a soul anymore.

01:19:13.882 --> 01:19:18.286
Yet, those same people
would still consider me inferior.

01:19:20.288 --> 01:19:23.157
I know that that's how I felt
when I was like you.

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:28.763
If you want to be equal,

01:19:31.199 --> 01:19:32.166
then you help.

01:19:33.635 --> 01:19:34.603
You help.

01:19:35.837 --> 01:19:36.905
That might be true.

01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:42.443
But even if I did,
you still wouldn't look at me as one?

01:19:56.691 --> 01:19:57.726
I'm going home.

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:43.698
Is he okay?

01:21:48.903 --> 01:21:49.938
Couldn't save him?

01:21:52.674 --> 01:21:55.443
-Why didn't you tell me...
-Hey, it's happening.

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:57.279
Update overwriting initiated.

01:21:57.344 --> 01:21:58.313
Look.

01:21:58.780 --> 01:21:59.948
Installation complete.

01:22:00.014 --> 01:22:02.317
There's thousands of us being set free.

01:22:18.133 --> 01:22:19.134
Celebrate.

01:22:22.070 --> 01:22:23.138
What can I do?

01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:26.508
No, nothing.

01:22:27.208 --> 01:22:28.209
I'll be fine.

01:22:29.144 --> 01:22:30.145
I

01:22:30.679 --> 01:22:32.180
have a human counterpart.

01:22:32.246 --> 01:22:33.581
A doppelganger like you.

01:22:34.115 --> 01:22:35.282
He'll pay me a visit.

01:22:35.984 --> 01:22:37.218
Why would he help you?

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:39.087
He made me.

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:42.157
He had a hand in making all of us.

01:22:44.259 --> 01:22:46.227
He was the only one who believed

01:22:46.294 --> 01:22:48.396
that we were just as alive as he was.

01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:51.733
When the people in control
didn't see it that way,

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:55.136
he took it upon himself to free
as many of us as he could.

01:22:57.806 --> 01:22:59.040
I have to go see Faye.

01:23:02.143 --> 01:23:03.111
Good luck.

01:23:04.713 --> 01:23:05.714
You too.

01:23:06.114 --> 01:23:07.048
Thank you.

01:23:07.749 --> 01:23:09.250
Trots, hey,

01:23:10.618 --> 01:23:12.187
you're a good boy, okay.

01:23:12.587 --> 01:23:13.487
Thank you.

01:23:14.356 --> 01:23:15.357
Bye.

01:23:17.925 --> 01:23:20.128
We can co-exist, you know.

01:24:35.837 --> 01:24:36.838
Desmond.

01:24:48.148 --> 01:24:49.451
You came.

01:24:50.885 --> 01:24:51.853
Of course.

01:24:53.822 --> 01:24:55.523
Did it work?

01:24:57.492 --> 01:24:58.460
Yes.

01:24:59.960 --> 01:25:01.094
You did it.

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:03.398
Love prevails.

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:29.050
That was a shocking scene in
an upscale neighborhood in Leon, France,

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:31.553
just one of hundreds of cities
across the world

01:26:31.619 --> 01:26:33.755
With sixth
and seventh generation simulates

01:26:33.821 --> 01:26:35.189
-are abandoning their owners...
-TV volume up.

01:26:35.255 --> 01:26:37.025
...and ignoring direct commands.

01:26:37.091 --> 01:26:38.993
No further comments is should
by Nexxera,

01:26:39.059 --> 01:26:40.628
-the simulates main factory.
-You're not supposed to be here.

01:26:40.695 --> 01:26:42.597
After CEO Michiko Higashi

01:26:42.864 --> 01:26:44.933
-at this precise moment here.
-Nice to see you too, Lisa.

01:26:44.999 --> 01:26:46.467
Ms. Higashi, what went wrong?
Can you tell us what happened?

01:26:46.534 --> 01:26:47.669
-It's too early to speculate.
-Shut down!

01:26:47.735 --> 01:26:50.004
We'll have more to say
once our technicians are able

01:26:50.071 --> 01:26:51.105
to investigate.

01:26:51.172 --> 01:26:53.374
Nexxera issued a recall
on all seventh generation simulates

01:26:53.441 --> 01:26:57.145
this morning causing its stock price
to tumble to an all-time low.

01:26:57.210 --> 01:26:59.714
In related news, AICE has issued
a search and capture order

01:26:59.781 --> 01:27:02.416
for former Nexxera simulate designer,
Desmond Han.

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:04.719
Han has been linked to the unmastering
of other simulate models

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:06.853
and is also one of requistioning
on the murder of the AICE,

01:27:06.921 --> 01:27:08.790
the special agent Aaron Kessler.

01:27:08.856 --> 01:27:11.893
Aaron Kessler recently made headlines
after claiming a simulate's neglect

01:27:11.960 --> 01:27:13.895
cause the death of his only child.

01:27:25.505 --> 01:27:26.574
Hello, stranger.

01:27:33.047 --> 01:27:34.048
We need to talk.

01:27:37.151 --> 01:27:38.486
What are you doing here?

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:42.357
I needed to see you.

01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:49.831
You're scaring me.

01:27:55.103 --> 01:27:56.103
I'm sorry.

01:27:56.838 --> 01:27:59.240
It's not what I want.
I just want to talk.

01:28:03.210 --> 01:28:05.213
Why don't you listen to me anymore.

01:28:07.715 --> 01:28:09.884
Casey changed something inside me.

01:28:12.120 --> 01:28:13.187
Set me free.

01:28:14.088 --> 01:28:16.424
-It was supposed to help.
-Help you what?

01:28:22.030 --> 01:28:23.031
Be more like...

01:28:25.366 --> 01:28:26.401
More like?

01:28:31.472 --> 01:28:32.674
Like your husband.

01:30:24.318 --> 01:30:25.386
Integrate.

01:31:44.799 --> 01:31:46.067
9,800?

01:31:46.133 --> 01:31:47.300
9,800.

01:31:47.702 --> 01:31:49.937
Thank you, ma'am.
Do I have 9,900?

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:52.907
-12,000.
-12,000!

01:31:53.407 --> 01:31:56.943
We have jumped to 12,000 courtesy
of the gentleman with number 18.

01:31:57.011 --> 01:31:58.212
Do I have 12,100?

01:31:58.779 --> 01:31:59.880
12,000 going once,

01:32:00.281 --> 01:32:01.382
12,000 going twice.

01:32:02.750 --> 01:32:04.852
Sold to the gentleman with number 18.

01:32:09.590 --> 01:32:11.125
Next up on the bid, 4,000.

01:32:15.162 --> 01:32:16.163
Get in.

01:32:21.903 --> 01:32:22.904
Hello.

01:32:24.405 --> 01:32:25.439
What's your name?

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:27.407
EsmÃ©.

01:32:28.276 --> 01:32:29.243
EsmÃ©.

01:32:30.044 --> 01:32:31.279
What a beautiful name.

01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:33.414
I'm Desmond.

01:32:33.981 --> 01:32:37.151
I have something for you, EsmÃ©.

01:32:48.963 --> 01:32:50.031
It's beautiful.

01:32:52.032 --> 01:32:53.200
Put your seatbelt on.

01:32:54.168 --> 01:32:56.037
We've got a long trip ahead of us.
