17:21.205 --> 17:23.207
Mr. Avery,
if you pardon me, please,

17:23.208 --> 17:24.834
you're not prepared
to go on this trek.

17:24.835 --> 17:26.377
You have no equipment or--

17:26.377 --> 17:28.463
l've got Danny's backpack
and all his stuff.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.256
But you haven't trained
for this walk.

17:30.257 --> 17:33.426
And no disrespect.
You're more than 60 years old.

17:33.427 --> 17:36.304
So it'll take me
a bit longer than most.

if you finish in two months.

18:58.220 --> 19:00.513

19:02.975 --> 19:06.102

- Something like that.

You'll know what to do with it

You can read about it in the guide.

19:16.113 --> 19:20.700
lt's a place of much significance.

19:20.701 --> 19:24.871
Monsieur Avery, do you know
why you're walking the Way?

19:24.872 --> 19:28.207
l suppose l'm doing it for Daniel.

19:28.208 --> 19:30.960
You walk the Way for yourself,
only for yourself.

My guidebook didn't say anything
about any detours.

26:00.058 --> 26:01.976

you haven't got the Dutch guidebook.

- Yep.

it's hard to say that, too.

53:05.056 --> 53:07.183
But l think this place
means something.

53:07.184 --> 53:09.018
This place means--

This place is brimming
with significance!

That's the problem
with this whole damn road.

- Problem?
- Metaphor, man.

53:14.774 --> 53:16.692
You're out walking all alone,

53:16.693 --> 53:18.360
and suddenly
in the middle of nowhere,

53:18.361 --> 53:20.279
you see a dogfight
near a cheese farm.

53:20.280 --> 53:22.656
What does that dogfight mean?

53:22.657 --> 53:24.366
And despite its literalness,

53:24.367 --> 53:29.121
the idea of a pilgrim's journey on this road
is a metaphor bonanza.

is amongst our oldest tropes.

the lonesome,

and the private.

You have the road to hell,

53:48.308 --> 53:50.976
There's the more dignified road
of Mr. Frost,

53:50.977 --> 53:52.978
and for Yanks,
every four years,

53:52.979 --> 53:55.314
there's the road
to the White House.

[sighs] Then you have the road
which most concerns me today,

54:00.654 --> 54:02.571

54:02.572 --> 54:06.742
which l fear
l must surely have taken.

54:06.743 --> 54:09.912
Well, Jack, maybe a dogfight
near a cheese farm

54:09.913 --> 54:12.581
is simply
a dogfight near a cheese farm.

54:14.125 --> 54:15.292
Ah!

54:15.293 --> 54:16.961
Okay.

54:19.005 --> 54:20.881
That's good.

54:20.882 --> 54:25.052
That is very good.

54:25.053 --> 54:28.514
Maybe l should adopt
a more conservative attitude

out of every curve in the road.

about the Way of Saint James,

it is that no one walks

01:02:15.690 --> 01:02:19.192
Stamp. The Ramón stamp.

01:02:19.193 --> 01:02:20.944
The Ramón stamp.

01:02:22.697 --> 01:02:24.156
Perfect.

01:02:24.157 --> 01:02:27.492
This is the proof
you have been with el Ramón.

01:02:29.245 --> 01:02:30.620
JACK: Yes, as l was saying--

01:02:30.621 --> 01:02:32.372
Ah, you must be hungry, yes?

01:02:32.373 --> 01:02:34.374
Yes? Ah, yes. You're tired.

01:02:34.375 --> 01:02:38.879
Of course. Well, but you have come
to the best refugio in all of Spain.

01:02:38.880 --> 01:02:41.339
ls there a baño
l could use, please?

01:02:41.340 --> 01:02:43.049
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.
Of course.

01:02:43.050 --> 01:02:45.051
[chuckles] Yes.

01:02:48.556 --> 01:02:50.140
Aha. ls there.

01:02:52.643 --> 01:02:56.897
Uh, it's a bit more serious,
let's say.

01:02:56.898 --> 01:02:59.274
Uh, one moment.

01:03:03.154 --> 01:03:04.529
Good? Good?

01:03:04.530 --> 01:03:07.115
- Yeah. Good.
- Good. [chuckles]

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:12.788
[rooster crowing]

01:03:15.374 --> 01:03:17.542
l think we're the only pilgrims here.

01:03:17.543 --> 01:03:19.669
The only ones alive.

01:03:19.670 --> 01:03:22.464
Tom, should we stay?

01:03:24.258 --> 01:03:27.260
lt's a bed and a meal,
few hours sleep.

01:03:27.261 --> 01:03:28.428
[woman laughing,
thumping]

01:03:30.306 --> 01:03:31.223
[man speaking foreign language]

01:03:31.224 --> 01:03:33.433
Obviously we've interrupted
something.

01:03:33.434 --> 01:03:37.145
Well, that was, uh, interesting.

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:39.856
Bit cold out there.
Who's next?

01:03:39.857 --> 01:03:42.734
[laughter upstairs]

01:03:42.735 --> 01:03:44.861
Maybe we should stay, no?

01:03:44.862 --> 01:03:46.863
Did anyone ask how much
he's charging for the night?

01:03:46.864 --> 01:03:48.448
'cause if it's more than
a couple of Euros, it's too much.

01:03:48.449 --> 01:03:50.075
Yeah, l second that.

01:03:50.076 --> 01:03:51.326
- l...
- All right.

01:03:51.327 --> 01:03:54.621
When he comes back down,
l'll ask him about the fee,

01:03:54.622 --> 01:03:57.916
but l don't think we're gonna get
a straight answer from el Ramón.

01:03:57.917 --> 01:03:59.835
[laughter and thumping]

01:04:01.128 --> 01:04:02.838
Well, it could be a while.

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:05.841
Okay.

01:04:05.842 --> 01:04:08.009
l'll go up and ask him.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:09.344
Them.

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:10.804
l'll go with you.

01:04:10.805 --> 01:04:12.597
- Yeah, me, too.
- Let's all go.

01:04:12.598 --> 01:04:15.308
What, are you all, five?

01:04:15.309 --> 01:04:17.102
No, just scared.

01:04:17.103 --> 01:04:18.728
Huh.

01:04:18.729 --> 01:04:20.730
[whooping and laughter]

01:04:23.776 --> 01:04:25.777
[broadcast playing]

01:04:45.923 --> 01:04:47.215
Un poco de vino.

01:04:47.216 --> 01:04:50.635
Es un poco de vino
del Ramón, sagrado.

01:04:50.636 --> 01:04:53.138
Eh, el vino de El Ramón.

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:54.306
Eh?

01:04:54.307 --> 01:04:56.099
[high voice] Gracias.

01:05:02.982 --> 01:05:05.692
Ah, man, it's 4 1/2 hours

01:05:05.693 --> 01:05:07.319
- to the next albergue.
- Really?

01:05:08.321 --> 01:05:10.947
Right, well, we gotta think about
setting up camp for the night.

01:05:10.948 --> 01:05:13.658
- No way.
- lt's getting dark.

01:05:13.659 --> 01:05:17.871
Hey, Boomer, Tom,
we gotta camp out.

01:05:26.505 --> 01:05:30.759
Now, this, this is
a true pilgrim experience.

01:05:30.760 --> 01:05:33.678
JOOST: Cheers to that,

01:05:33.679 --> 01:05:35.513
even though l hated
camping as a boy.

01:05:35.514 --> 01:05:38.975
SARAH: "True pilgrim experience"?
What do you mean by that?

01:05:38.976 --> 01:05:42.062
Ah, well, l'm talking about tradition
in the purest sense.

01:05:42.063 --> 01:05:44.940
A true pilgrim walks the Camino
with nothing.

01:05:44.941 --> 01:05:47.817
He has to live off the land,

01:05:47.818 --> 01:05:49.694
he has to accept the kindness
presented to him,

01:05:49.695 --> 01:05:52.781
and he has to carry his goods
on his back.

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:56.409
Pilgrim is poor and must suffer.

01:05:56.410 --> 01:05:58.244
SARAH: That strikes me as extreme

01:05:58.245 --> 01:06:00.997
to say the only way
to be a true pilgrim

01:06:00.998 --> 01:06:03.625
is to imitate what we like to think
a true pilgrim is.

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:07.796
Should a pilgrim dress himself
as a beggar even if he isn't?

01:06:07.797 --> 01:06:09.839
Do we honor the poor
by imitating them?

01:06:09.840 --> 01:06:12.926
l don't think that pilgrims
500 years ago

01:06:12.927 --> 01:06:15.470
ignored the creature comforts
of the road

01:06:15.471 --> 01:06:16.805
any more than we should now.

01:06:16.806 --> 01:06:19.766
JOOST: Yeah, and what about
pilgrims on bikes

01:06:19.767 --> 01:06:22.936
or--or pilgrims that do the Camino
on horseback?

01:06:22.937 --> 01:06:25.355
No, tradition would
dismiss bikers at least.

01:06:25.356 --> 01:06:28.483
Biking or riding requires
less suffering and less work.

01:06:28.484 --> 01:06:30.819
But l don't think
we have to artificially

01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:33.363
add more hardship
than is already there.

01:06:33.364 --> 01:06:36.449
That, in my opinion, is being
a false pilgrim, not a true one.

01:06:36.450 --> 01:06:39.452
lf you were a man, l would challenge you
to pistols at dawn.

01:06:39.453 --> 01:06:41.579
[laughter]

01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:42.664
What do you think, Boomer?

01:06:44.875 --> 01:06:48.211
Finally, an American
without an opinion.

01:06:48.212 --> 01:06:49.796
Take a picture.

01:06:49.797 --> 01:06:51.131
[laughter]

01:07:24.457 --> 01:07:26.708
- Good morning, sunshine.
- Oh!

01:07:28.794 --> 01:07:30.545
Hey.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.130
Where are the guys?

01:07:32.131 --> 01:07:36.009
Out gathering some provisions
from the local farms.

01:07:36.010 --> 01:07:39.345
- Like true pilgrims?
- Yeah.

01:07:39.346 --> 01:07:42.015
So you weren't even
gonna say goodbye, Boomer?

01:07:42.016 --> 01:07:44.225
Yeah, well...

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:51.191
What are you doing out here, Tom,
besides taking a really long walk?

01:07:52.234 --> 01:07:53.443
Why do you care?

01:07:57.448 --> 01:08:00.533
Joost told me
you were a--a doctor.

01:08:00.534 --> 01:08:02.452
- Yeah.
- What do you practice?

01:08:02.453 --> 01:08:03.953
l'm an ophthalmologist.

01:08:03.954 --> 01:08:06.081
- An eye doctor.
- Yeah.

01:08:06.082 --> 01:08:10.752
Ah. So you, uh, you help people
see the world a little better, huh?

01:08:10.753 --> 01:08:12.796
Yeah, that's one way to put it.

01:08:12.797 --> 01:08:14.130
[box clatters]

01:08:14.131 --> 01:08:16.341
- l got it.
- No, no. No, no.

01:08:16.341 --> 01:08:17.466
Unh!

01:08:26.060 --> 01:08:27.560
l...

01:08:39.156 --> 01:08:40.490
l'm sorry.

01:08:44.870 --> 01:08:45.870
[laughs]

01:08:45.871 --> 01:08:46.996
Whoo!

01:08:46.997 --> 01:08:49.040
Three cheers
for the true pilgrims.

01:08:49.041 --> 01:08:51.084
Hot bread and coffee
for everyone.

01:08:51.085 --> 01:08:53.419
Oranges, apples. See?
We're living off the land.

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:55.546
This is the way
it's supposed to be.

01:08:57.049 --> 01:08:58.049
Hey, Tom.

01:08:58.050 --> 01:08:59.591
Hey. Have a look.

01:08:59.593 --> 01:09:01.010
- Sleep well?
- Yep.

01:09:01.011 --> 01:09:03.345
- No. Gracias.
- Do we have knives?

01:09:03.346 --> 01:09:05.765
We don't need knives.
Just rip it apart.

01:09:05.765 --> 01:09:07.725
Orange, Tom? Eh? Orange?

01:09:07.725 --> 01:09:08.725
No, thank you.

01:09:11.354 --> 01:09:13.148
Right.

01:09:13.149 --> 01:09:15.316
Let's get this coffee on the go.

01:09:15.317 --> 01:09:17.026
You okay, Tom?

01:09:17.027 --> 01:09:18.528
Yeah. Why?

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:58.359
[woman singing in Spanish]

01:10:13.500 --> 01:10:14.959
Tom.

01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:18.421
l'm sure the last thing
in the world

01:10:18.422 --> 01:10:21.299
you want to do is have
a conversation with me.

01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:22.800
You'd be right about that.

01:10:24.345 --> 01:10:26.763
Tom, your son--

01:10:26.764 --> 01:10:29.098
Joost told me. l--

01:10:29.099 --> 01:10:32.101
l'm so sorry.
l had no idea.

01:10:32.102 --> 01:10:34.270
Joost told you, huh?
That figures.

01:10:38.025 --> 01:10:40.818
l don't know what to say, but...

01:10:40.819 --> 01:10:43.112
the way you touched me,
grabbed my arm,

01:10:43.113 --> 01:10:45.949
just--l mean, in my other life,

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:48.451
my life before the Camino,
l was married.

01:10:48.452 --> 01:10:53.498
l was married, and l was pregnant,
my first, my only.

01:10:56.085 --> 01:11:00.713
But my husband
was not a kind man,

01:11:00.714 --> 01:11:02.674
so l terminated.

01:11:02.675 --> 01:11:05.301
l got rid of my baby girl, Tom.

01:11:05.302 --> 01:11:09.222
Didn't want the son of a bitch
to have two of us to beat up on.

01:11:15.896 --> 01:11:19.357
Sometimes l hear her voice,
my baby.

01:11:21.443 --> 01:11:25.363
l know it sounds crazy 'cause
she never got to take her first breath,

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:31.286
but l imagine what
she would have sounded like.

01:11:35.165 --> 01:11:37.500
And sometimes l hear her, Tom.

01:11:40.421 --> 01:11:43.256
Sometimes l swear
l can hear her.

01:11:46.343 --> 01:11:48.344
l'm sorry about your baby.

01:11:49.555 --> 01:11:51.597
Sorry about yours.

01:11:52.891 --> 01:11:54.642
My son was almost 40.

01:11:54.643 --> 01:11:56.978
Yeah, but he'll always be your baby.

01:12:01.442 --> 01:12:03.026
Well...

01:12:53.577 --> 01:12:55.286
Pilgrims, we have arrived.

01:12:55.287 --> 01:12:57.789
l'm gonna get us a bottle.
Or three.

01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:00.458
Oh, hey, you'll need
an extra hand for that.

01:13:00.459 --> 01:13:02.460
[overlapping conversations]

01:13:04.671 --> 01:13:06.005
JACK: iHola!

01:13:09.551 --> 01:13:11.677
Look, Tom, l--
l want to apologize again.

01:13:11.678 --> 01:13:12.970
l'm really sorry--

01:13:12.971 --> 01:13:15.473
Can we talk about
something else, please?

01:13:15.474 --> 01:13:18.017
But l hit you with everything l had,
and you took it.

01:13:18.018 --> 01:13:20.978
My mother taught me
that only a coward hits a woman.

01:13:20.979 --> 01:13:23.439
How'd she do that?

01:13:23.440 --> 01:13:26.776
She whupped the hell out of me
every time l hit my little sister

01:13:26.777 --> 01:13:29.445
till l finally got the message.

01:13:30.572 --> 01:13:34.200
My ex could have learned something
from your mother.

01:13:34.201 --> 01:13:36.869
Smoke 'em if you got 'em, eh?

01:13:36.870 --> 01:13:40.331
l'd smoke across
this whole damn country, Boomer.

01:13:42.835 --> 01:13:46.337
There's a whole world out there
to beat you up plenty.

01:13:46.338 --> 01:13:48.589
You don't need to go
looking for people to pile on.

01:13:49.716 --> 01:13:53.177
Glad you became an eye doc
instead of a headshrinker.

01:13:53.178 --> 01:13:55.680
The first consultation is free.

01:13:55.681 --> 01:13:57.723
Let there be wine!

01:13:57.724 --> 01:13:59.267
Let the drinking commence.

01:14:03.355 --> 01:14:06.691
JACK: ...whereas Paulo Coelho
examined the spiritual in the Camino,

01:14:06.692 --> 01:14:09.360
was inspired to write
his first book afterwards.

01:14:09.361 --> 01:14:12.530
So l said to them...

01:14:12.531 --> 01:14:15.741
the last thing in the world
you need to publish

01:14:15.742 --> 01:14:18.327
and the last thing
l am willing to write

01:14:18.328 --> 01:14:20.746
is another bloody guidebook
on the Camino.

01:14:20.747 --> 01:14:24.792
l mean, how does one follow
the Codex Calixtinus anyway?

01:14:24.793 --> 01:14:28.129
- The what?
- Codex Calixtinus,

01:14:28.130 --> 01:14:30.339
Liber Sancti Jacobi.

01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.634
SARAH: Devotees of the Way
regard it as the first tourist guide.

01:14:33.635 --> 01:14:35.178
That's right. lt is the source,

01:14:35.179 --> 01:14:39.724
attributed to the writings
of Pope Callixtus ll,

01:14:39.725 --> 01:14:40.808
the twelfth century.

01:14:40.809 --> 01:14:44.103
lt is a work of wonder
divided into five folios.

01:14:44.104 --> 01:14:47.398
Book one,
Anthologia Liturgica.

01:14:47.399 --> 01:14:50.067
Book two, De Miraculis
Sancti Jacobi.

01:14:50.068 --> 01:14:52.195
Book three translates
the writings of Saint James.

01:14:52.196 --> 01:14:53.446
[distant thunder]
Book four, the lesser known,

01:14:53.447 --> 01:14:55.281
banned by the Church of Rome,

01:14:55.282 --> 01:14:57.783
details Charlemagne's vision
of Saint James

01:14:57.784 --> 01:15:00.453
instructing him
to destroy the Moors.

01:15:00.454 --> 01:15:04.790
But it is book five, folio five,
which most concerns us.

01:15:04.791 --> 01:15:09.712
Historians believe it is the first book
ever written on the pilgrimage.

01:15:09.713 --> 01:15:11.839
[echoing, distorting]
So the dilemma for me

01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:15.635
is to come up with

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:57.998
All close, personal friends?

01:28:57.999 --> 01:29:00.250
Actually, yes.

01:29:18.895 --> 01:29:22.356
Of course you are taking
your son's remains to Muxia.

01:29:22.357 --> 01:29:25.025
No, to Santiago de Compostela.

01:29:25.026 --> 01:29:27.027
You go the cathedral in Santiago

01:29:27.028 --> 01:29:29.321
for the pilgrims' mass
and the blessing.

01:29:29.322 --> 01:29:34.659
You must continue across Galicia
to the sea.

01:29:34.660 --> 01:29:37.704
There is a shrine in Muxia,

01:29:37.705 --> 01:29:39.373
la Virgen de la barca.

01:29:41.250 --> 01:29:43.543
Go there.

01:29:43.544 --> 01:29:47.506
Place the remains
of your son in the water.

01:29:49.258 --> 01:29:52.427
lt is for him and--
and for you.

01:29:55.014 --> 01:29:59.184
lshmael, l'm not
a very religious man.

01:29:59.185 --> 01:30:01.645
Religion has nothing
to do with this.

01:30:03.523 --> 01:30:05.273
Nothing at all.

Hey.

01:30:30.883 --> 01:30:33.260
lshmael, please,
l can take it from him now.

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:37.305
He will carry it to the very edge
of town, not one step less.

01:30:37.306 --> 01:30:40.642
But he couldn't have known
what was in the bag.

01:30:40.643 --> 01:30:43.603
Don't you think you should
cut him some slack?

01:30:43.604 --> 01:30:45.272
And what if it were your son?

01:30:46.816 --> 01:30:50.944
Stealing is bad enough
and wrong.

01:30:50.945 --> 01:30:53.655
But what my son did
could have brought

01:30:53.656 --> 01:30:55.907
more than shame
to our community.

01:30:55.908 --> 01:30:57.909
Ah, yes. You mean like a curse.

01:30:57.910 --> 01:31:01.163

01:31:26.606 --> 01:31:27.606
Lo siento.

01:31:38.743 --> 01:31:40.577
Our children,

01:31:40.578 --> 01:31:43.872
they are the very best
and the very worst of us.

Jack Emerson Stanton.

01:46:04.107 --> 01:46:05.566
Thomas Avery.

01:46:05.567 --> 01:46:07.234
Where did you start the Camino?

01:46:07.235 --> 01:46:08.235
ln Saint-Jean.

01:46:08.236 --> 01:46:10.196
ln Saint-Jean-Pied--

01:46:10.197 --> 01:46:11.197
Saint-Jean-Pied-de-Port.
Okay.

01:46:11.198 --> 01:46:12.365
ln Paris, Notre Dame.

01:46:12.366 --> 01:46:13.366
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:46:13.367 --> 01:46:15.242
Canada.

01:46:15.243 --> 01:46:16.744
Have you walked the whole way?

01:46:16.745 --> 01:46:19.205
Yes, we did.
Uh, l did.

01:46:19.206 --> 01:46:21.290
Unfortunately, yes.

01:46:21.291 --> 01:46:23.209
So what is your reason
for walking the Way?

01:46:24.252 --> 01:46:27.588
WOMAN: What are your reasons
for having done this pilgrimage?

01:46:27.589 --> 01:46:30.216
Um, l mean,
do you have some kind

01:46:30.217 --> 01:46:33.344
of religious or spiritual
motivation or...

01:46:33.345 --> 01:46:34.637
Religious, yes.

01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:37.139
l mean, uh...

01:46:40.435 --> 01:46:41.435
Leprechauns.

01:46:41.436 --> 01:46:44.480
l was, uh, looking for leprechauns
at the end of the road.

01:46:44.481 --> 01:46:46.899
l, um, l needed to lose weight.

01:46:46.900 --> 01:46:49.443
Um, well, uh...

01:46:49.444 --> 01:46:52.196
lt's also because my--my wife

01:46:52.197 --> 01:46:54.073
didn't want to sleep
with me anymore,

01:46:54.074 --> 01:46:55.741
but it's because
l'm--l'm too fat.

01:46:55.742 --> 01:46:58.119
l...

01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:00.830
thought that l--

01:47:00.831 --> 01:47:03.624
l should probably travel more.

01:47:05.836 --> 01:47:07.294
l was a writer,

01:47:07.295 --> 01:47:08.754
l stopped writing,

01:47:08.755 --> 01:47:10.840
and now l'm writing again.

01:47:10.841 --> 01:47:15.845
lt's passport with the official stamp
of the cathedral,

01:47:15.846 --> 01:47:18.097
and this is your Compostela.

01:47:19.307 --> 01:47:20.349
lt's in Latin.

01:47:20.350 --> 01:47:21.851
lt's all written in Latin

01:47:21.852 --> 01:47:24.019
because this document
dates from the Middle Ages.

01:47:24.020 --> 01:47:28.274
Uh, l'm terribly sorry.

01:47:28.275 --> 01:47:31.235
Um, l gave you the wrong name.

01:47:31.236 --> 01:47:35.823
Yeah, but l've already
entered it, you know.

01:47:35.824 --> 01:47:39.702
l see that, but, um,
could you please change it?

01:47:43.582 --> 01:47:45.124
Okay, as you wish.

01:47:48.211 --> 01:47:51.297

- Daniel Avery.

01:47:56.470 --> 01:47:58.095

01:48:03.059 --> 01:48:04.852
All right.

01:48:04.853 --> 01:48:06.187
Thank you very much.

01:48:41.264 --> 01:48:43.265
Ah, well, l'm here, ain't l?

01:48:51.233 --> 01:48:53.317
lt's the Portico of Glory.

01:48:53.318 --> 01:48:56.779
[gasps] lt's him, Saint James.

01:48:57.948 --> 01:48:59.907
Um, tradition commands

01:48:59.908 --> 01:49:03.827
that pilgrims approach the statue
on their knees.

01:49:03.828 --> 01:49:06.038
El Cid, Saint Francis,

01:49:06.039 --> 01:49:08.040
Von Eyck,

01:49:08.041 --> 01:49:11.877
kings, queens,
millions of pilgrims,

01:49:11.878 --> 01:49:16.423
they all collapsed to their knees
out of gratitude.

01:51:02.364 --> 01:51:04.365
[woman vocalizing]

01:53:51.533 --> 01:53:54.034
[music fades]

01:54:08.842 --> 01:54:10.968
[new instrumental begins]

01:54:15.098 --> 01:54:17.057
[chuckles]

01:54:17.058 --> 01:54:22.479
[laughs]

01:54:59.434 --> 01:55:00.475
[music ends]

01:55:00.476 --> 01:55:02.477
[waves crashing]

01:55:11.362 --> 01:55:12.946
Writers,

01:55:12.947 --> 01:55:15.824
they always want
the last word.

01:55:15.825 --> 01:55:17.409
But this...

01:55:39.307 --> 01:55:42.267
This was never about
quitting these things.

01:55:43.853 --> 01:55:46.104
But you knew that.

01:55:53.488 --> 01:55:55.989
l needed a new suit anyway.
