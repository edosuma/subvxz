00:01.610 --> 00:03.394
Dude. Previously
onCrazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:03.438 --> 00:04.482
I get it. You love me.

00:04.526 --> 00:06.397
But the way you show your love

00:06.441 --> 00:07.877
is so messed up.

00:07.920 --> 00:08.878
We're not right for each other.

00:08.921 --> 00:10.662
And we never will be.

00:10.706 --> 00:12.838
I don't know why I can't have
that closeness with anyone else.

00:12.882 --> 00:15.711
Well, you could try
being nicer to people.

00:15.754 --> 00:16.929
NATHANIEL: You think
I don't know that I'm a jerk?

00:16.973 --> 00:18.235
I don't want to be like that.

00:18.279 --> 00:19.802
My mother told me who to be.

00:19.845 --> 00:21.804
NAOMI: Nothing is going to ruin
your future.

00:21.847 --> 00:23.980
I sacrificed my dreams for you.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.242
You want that promotion,
don't you?

00:25.286 --> 00:26.548
REBECCA:
And I went along with it all

00:26.591 --> 00:28.941
because I told myself
they weren't my choices.

00:28.985 --> 00:30.987
This guy can meet you
at a bar in 20 minutes.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.336
Go for it. What are those?

00:32.380 --> 00:33.903
Oh, carpal tunnel.

00:33.946 --> 00:35.296
REBECCA:
In another context,

00:35.339 --> 00:38.734
you'd be great, but you're
not a healthy choice.

00:38.777 --> 00:41.519
Are you finally moving out
of Hector's mom's house?No, she's awesome.

00:41.563 --> 00:43.260
You got to move out
of her house. Enough.

00:43.304 --> 00:45.001
Se acabó. Basta.

00:45.045 --> 00:46.089
I don't want to be
a lawyer anymore.

00:46.133 --> 00:47.699
I'm thinking of calling it...

00:47.743 --> 00:48.961
Rebetzel's.

00:49.005 --> 00:50.572
I would love to try

00:50.615 --> 00:53.227
and help you and any of
the other women in here.

00:53.270 --> 00:54.358
So, what do you guys think?

00:55.403 --> 00:58.406

So, I complete the work skills
program by Friday,

01:38.663 --> 01:40.274
then I get my certificate,

01:40.317 --> 01:43.059
and then I can go ahead
and file for sentence relief.Exactly.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.888
Okay, perfect.And Nicky, I talked to
your public defender,

01:45.931 --> 01:47.150
and you will be hearing
about your parole

01:47.194 --> 01:48.717
in the next couple days or so.

01:48.760 --> 01:51.328
Good. Talked to my work.
They said they'd take me back.

01:51.372 --> 01:54.070
Just kind of want to get back
to my life, really.

01:54.114 --> 01:56.203
Don't worry, you're getting out
of here. It's just a formality.

01:56.246 --> 01:58.857
Um, oh, I won't
be here next week,

01:58.901 --> 02:00.207
but my friend Paula's
subbing in for me.

02:00.250 --> 02:02.426
And she's not a lawyer yet,
but she will be,

02:02.470 --> 02:04.515
and she loves the law.

02:04.559 --> 02:06.474
Hmm, should be
a nice change of pace, then.

02:06.517 --> 02:07.997
Yeah, sounds like a step up.

02:08.040 --> 02:09.955
Yep.So, where're you going?

02:09.999 --> 02:12.132
Oh, it's-it's boring.
My mom's being honored

02:12.175 --> 02:13.220
by this Jewish charity
back east,

02:13.263 --> 02:15.265
and I haven't seen her since...

02:15.309 --> 02:18.834
oh, I tried to kill myself,
got a diagnosis,

02:18.877 --> 02:20.401
pushed a guy off the roof
and went to jail,

02:20.444 --> 02:21.967
so she doesn't know the truth,

02:22.011 --> 02:24.709
and it's time
to tell her all that.

02:24.753 --> 02:26.972
Wait, so you're gonna
tell her everything?

02:27.016 --> 02:29.845
Yeah. I figure
if I'm honest with her,

02:29.888 --> 02:32.282
maybe we'll finally have
a better relationship.

02:32.326 --> 02:34.023
Hmm.

02:34.066 --> 02:35.503
Rebecca, I have a question.

02:35.546 --> 02:38.506
So, last week you said you
were going on the dating apps.

02:38.549 --> 02:40.116
Did you meet someone,
and did they think

02:40.160 --> 02:41.900
the whole jail thing
was hot or weird?

02:41.944 --> 02:43.989
I'm asking for a friend.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.382
The friend is me.Okay.

02:45.426 --> 02:46.905
You don't tell people
on dating apps

02:46.949 --> 02:48.255
that you've been in jail.
Come on.

02:48.298 --> 02:50.126
Well, old Rebecca
might not have mentioned it,

02:50.170 --> 02:53.695
but, like I said,
new Rebecca is honest.

02:53.738 --> 02:56.001
Totally honest.

02:56.045 --> 02:58.352
"Recovering from recent
suicide attempt.

02:58.395 --> 03:01.485
Have been known
to stalk my exes."

03:01.529 --> 03:05.750
Wow, that is an
honest profile.Yep.

03:05.794 --> 03:08.100
Look, lying is bad for me.
It's a slippery slope.

03:08.144 --> 03:11.103
I tell one little lie,
next thing you know, jail.Okay.

03:11.147 --> 03:13.193
I think it's okay
to lie sometimes.

03:13.236 --> 03:14.542
You know, on my profile
I don't mention

03:14.585 --> 03:16.108
that I get gassy from gluten

03:16.152 --> 03:17.762
or that my back handspring
needs work.

03:17.806 --> 03:19.982
Hey, you know, maybe I can
find you some good people.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.549
You've swiped for me,
I'll swipe for you.

03:21.592 --> 03:24.291
I've been out there a while,
so I'm kind of an expert.

03:24.334 --> 03:27.685
Sure, knock yourself out.Right.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.426
Well, here are some obvious nos.

03:29.470 --> 03:31.428
Weird facial hair,
iguana on shoulder,

03:31.472 --> 03:34.431
thumb ring.So many thumb rings.

03:34.475 --> 03:35.824
Oh, here's a good one.

03:35.867 --> 03:38.435
Kind face, good smile.
Swiping yes.

03:39.958 --> 03:42.265
Oh, a match. Check it out.

03:42.309 --> 03:44.702
Really?

03:44.746 --> 03:46.704
Oh, my God, that's Jason.

03:46.748 --> 03:48.706
I've been on a date
with this guy. He had, um...

03:48.750 --> 03:51.231
right, these greasy,
smelly balls.

03:51.274 --> 03:52.406
Uh, what?

03:52.449 --> 03:53.972
No, uh, stress balls
for carpal tunnel,

03:54.016 --> 03:55.191
but he was fondling them
all night.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.888
You know, this guy,

03:56.932 --> 03:58.760
he never got a fair shake
from me.

03:58.803 --> 04:00.109
Mostly 'cause
I was obsessed with you

04:00.152 --> 04:01.763
and stalking you
and trying to ruin your life.

04:03.286 --> 04:04.331
I'm just being honest.

04:04.374 --> 04:05.897
Mm-hmm.Huh.

04:05.941 --> 04:08.248
I still have this guy's number.
Maybe I'll text him back.

04:08.291 --> 04:10.250
Well, cool.
If he makes plans in advance,

04:10.293 --> 04:12.252
that means he likes
you. Oh, yeah.

04:12.295 --> 04:13.688
Usually it's same-night hookups,

04:13.731 --> 04:15.951
and if someone is not into you,
they cancel last minute.

04:15.994 --> 04:18.562
Trust me, I know these things.

04:18.606 --> 04:21.565
It's brutal out there.

04:23.306 --> 04:25.874
Thanks again so much

04:25.917 --> 04:28.572
for letting me stay here
while you're out of town, Becks.

04:28.616 --> 04:29.878
I'm not sure where to go

04:29.921 --> 04:31.445
now that I've moved out
of Hector's mom's place.

04:31.488 --> 04:33.055
Oh, yeah. Congrats
on that, by the way.

04:33.098 --> 04:34.448
I was too embarrassed
to go home,

04:34.491 --> 04:36.450
so I'm sleeping at the YMCA.

04:36.493 --> 04:39.061
Don't listen to the song.
It's not fun to stay there.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.063
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

04:41.106 --> 04:43.283
Well, happy to have you here,

04:43.326 --> 04:44.632
and I'm sure you'll find
your own place soon.

04:44.675 --> 04:46.155
Yeah.You know,

04:46.198 --> 04:48.200
it just occurred to me. Have
you ever lived on your own?

04:48.244 --> 04:50.290
Oh, yeah. In New York.
I mean,

04:50.333 --> 04:51.508
I shared the apartment
with my landlord's mom,

04:51.552 --> 04:53.031
but we had our own rooms.

04:53.075 --> 04:55.730
Wait, didn't you and Hector's
mom have your own rooms?

04:56.905 --> 04:58.341
Cool. Okay, so, some things

04:58.385 --> 04:59.864
you need to know
about the house.

04:59.908 --> 05:02.780
Uh, Wi-Fi password
is "525,600minutes."

05:02.824 --> 05:04.478
Trash goes out on Thursday.

05:04.521 --> 05:06.654
I left some frozen Rebetzels
for you in the freezer.All right!

05:06.697 --> 05:08.177
Oh, and feed
Estrella once a day.

05:08.220 --> 05:09.265
The fish flakes
are right there.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.397
Right by the tank.

05:10.440 --> 05:12.137
That's it. Okay.
You know what,

05:12.181 --> 05:13.965
no matter what happens with
my mother on this trip,

05:14.009 --> 05:17.012
I am so excited to see
some fall foliage.

05:17.055 --> 05:18.709
I really miss East
Coast seasons.

05:18.753 --> 05:20.624
We have seasons in L.A.

05:20.668 --> 05:23.148
T-shirt, sweatshirt,
puffer and tank top.

05:23.192 --> 05:25.150
Okay. All right.

05:25.194 --> 05:26.935
Have a good time.
Don't wreck the place.

05:26.978 --> 05:29.329
Wreck the place No.

05:29.372 --> 05:31.983
I'm the clean one.
Hector's mom was dirty.

05:32.027 --> 05:34.943
Okay. Bye.

05:34.986 --> 05:36.988
Bye.

05:39.164 --> 05:41.210
So, what should we do first,
Estrella?

05:41.253 --> 05:42.603
Can I call you Estrella?

05:44.431 --> 05:47.521
Cool. I'm Josh.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.523
Whee!

05:49.566 --> 05:53.222
Want a pretzel?
Get you a pretzel.

05:57.269 --> 05:59.620
BOTH: One, two, three, four,
I declare a thumb war.

05:59.663 --> 06:01.143
Ready?No, ready, begin.

06:01.186 --> 06:02.318
Hello there, Tim and Jim.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.322
Want a doughnut?

06:07.454 --> 06:08.629
I told the man

06:08.672 --> 06:10.935
to put the most fattening ones
in there.

06:10.979 --> 06:13.198
They're free,
and they're for you.

06:15.244 --> 06:16.724
Ooh, don't do it. It's a trick.

06:16.767 --> 06:19.117
Oh, is this like the time I
tried to make the elevator

06:19.161 --> 06:20.292
and you pressed
the close button, yelling,

06:20.336 --> 06:22.077
"Take the stairs, lose a few"?

06:22.120 --> 06:23.687
Let me be honest.

06:23.731 --> 06:26.298
I've been going through
a lot lately.

06:26.342 --> 06:27.778
Hideous breakup.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.998
I spilled some ashes on myself
and learned how to cry,

06:30.041 --> 06:31.869
so now I'm just... I'm trying

06:31.913 --> 06:34.045
to be a nicer...

06:34.089 --> 06:38.006
kinder, gentler guy.

06:38.049 --> 06:40.008
Okay?

06:40.051 --> 06:43.228
So... cruller?

06:50.366 --> 06:53.108
Take a bite! Come on.

06:57.242 --> 07:00.245
Mmm.Mmm.

07:01.377 --> 07:03.118
Enjoy.

07:06.817 --> 07:08.471
I'm telling you,
he's up to something.

07:08.515 --> 07:11.431
PAULA: Maybe we should just
take Nathaniel at his word.

07:11.474 --> 07:13.520
Maybe he legitimately
wants to be nice.

07:15.522 --> 07:18.089
Ugh.Oh.

07:20.265 --> 07:24.226
Yep, something weird
is definitely going on.

07:24.269 --> 07:26.228
:
Damn it.

07:26.271 --> 07:28.404
Okay, I need to sneak out,
and I do not want to deal

07:28.448 --> 07:30.319
with whatever psycho thing
is going on

07:30.362 --> 07:31.494
with him right now.

07:31.538 --> 07:34.628
Will you and Tim cover for me?

07:36.499 --> 07:38.109
Okay.

07:38.153 --> 07:40.372
So, my eldest,
he wants to play the tuba

07:40.416 --> 07:42.462
in orchestra, and I'm like,

07:42.505 --> 07:44.855
"Get an instrument
that's gonna get you laid."

07:44.899 --> 07:47.467
I-I played the snare,
and I lost my virginity

07:47.510 --> 07:49.469
to my high school band
teacher.

07:49.512 --> 07:52.384
No, no, no, no, no, not like
that. I was 26 at the time.

07:52.428 --> 07:54.517
So, uh...
Is that, uh,

07:54.561 --> 07:57.694
too late

07:57.738 --> 07:59.304
It was right on time

07:59.348 --> 08:01.829
for me.

08:09.837 --> 08:11.795
Hi!Guys, I'm here.

08:11.839 --> 08:13.362
Hi!You're here.

08:13.405 --> 08:14.755
Hi.Hey.

08:14.798 --> 08:17.322
Hey, welcome, hey.Oh, my God.

08:17.366 --> 08:18.802
Oh, yeah, come in,
come in, come in. Look.

08:18.846 --> 08:20.761
Look at this place.

08:20.804 --> 08:22.545
It's so tiny.

08:22.589 --> 08:24.025
How much are you paying
for this again?

08:24.068 --> 08:25.156
Eight grand a month.

08:25.200 --> 08:26.897
You know, in New York,
that's a steal.

08:26.941 --> 08:29.378
And we have a guest bed.

08:29.421 --> 08:32.468
No. Oh, my God. Totally.

08:32.512 --> 08:35.602
It's the coolest thing.Wow.

08:35.645 --> 08:38.169
So cozy. I love it.

08:38.213 --> 08:40.084
Oh, yay!

08:40.128 --> 08:42.478
Guys, thank you so, so much

08:42.522 --> 08:44.175
for letting me stay
with you, really.Yeah.

08:44.219 --> 08:47.527
Last time I stayed
with my mom, she drugged me.Whoa.

08:47.570 --> 08:50.573
Oh, it's a long story.
I'll tell you sometime.

08:52.619 --> 08:55.578
Oh, hey, sexy stranger.

08:55.622 --> 08:57.624
Sorry, it's this guy Jason.
Uh, we matched online,

08:57.667 --> 09:00.583
and I guess we're gonna go
on a date when I get back.

09:00.627 --> 09:02.890
Oh, great!BETH: Yeah.

09:02.933 --> 09:04.848
Huge relief.
You got to get laid.

09:04.892 --> 09:06.807
Valencia says that all the time.

09:06.850 --> 09:09.157
Oh, so you guys, uh,
talk about my sex life?

09:11.725 --> 09:15.511
That is so sweet.
I love you both so much.

09:15.555 --> 09:19.297
All right, I guess
I should go see Naomi and...

09:19.341 --> 09:21.343
tell her the truth,
the whole truth

09:21.386 --> 09:23.388
and nothing but the... Yeah.

09:24.433 --> 09:26.957
Hey, V, are you busy today?

09:27.001 --> 09:29.394
Why? You need
some moral support?

09:30.657 --> 09:33.050
I've been waiting for hours.

09:34.791 --> 09:37.446
I'm only, like,
ten minutes late.

09:37.489 --> 09:39.013
Late is late.

09:39.056 --> 09:42.712
Cool. Great to see you, too,
Mom, after, like, a year.

09:42.756 --> 09:45.410
I brought my friend Valencia.
You might remember her.

09:45.454 --> 09:47.717
You've got a nice figure.

09:47.761 --> 09:49.806
What do you eat,
and when do you eat it?

09:49.850 --> 09:51.025
Please write this down for me,

09:51.068 --> 09:52.592
'cause I'm always looking
for tips.

09:52.635 --> 09:54.594
Now, this event,

09:54.637 --> 09:55.856
let's review the details.

09:55.899 --> 09:57.553
Hey, before we do that, um,

09:57.597 --> 09:59.555
there are some things
I think we should talk about.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.514
Did I mention that Elayne
Boosler is introducing me?

10:02.558 --> 10:05.126
Oh, uh, wow.

10:05.169 --> 10:07.128
Who?

10:07.171 --> 10:08.695
Elayne Boosler.

10:08.738 --> 10:09.739
It's...Um...

10:09.783 --> 10:10.784
One of the great Jewish

10:10.827 --> 10:12.002
female comediennes of all time.

10:12.046 --> 10:12.960
Hmm.Hmm.

10:13.003 --> 10:13.961
You got your Totie Fields,

10:14.004 --> 10:15.005
your Joan Rivers,

10:15.049 --> 10:16.224
your Fran Drescher,

10:16.267 --> 10:19.270
and then you got
your Elayne Boosler...

10:19.314 --> 10:20.750
who just so happens to be

10:20.794 --> 10:23.013
a close and personal friend
of mine.

10:23.057 --> 10:25.276
We're friends
from Jewish summer camp.

10:25.320 --> 10:26.538
We went to Camp Kavetcha.

10:26.582 --> 10:28.584
You've heard of Camp Kavetcha,
of course.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.542
Oh, yeah, yep.
Yep, yep, yep.Why would she have heard...

10:30.586 --> 10:32.544
Rebecca, this event is massive.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.155
Everyone who is anyone

10:34.198 --> 10:36.636
in the Northern Westchester
Modern Reform Jewish community

10:36.679 --> 10:38.028
:
is coming.

10:38.072 --> 10:39.900
Including Elayne Boosler.

10:39.943 --> 10:41.902
Right. And that's
very cool. So...

10:41.945 --> 10:43.947
hey, Mom, before we start
talking about the event,

10:43.991 --> 10:45.340
um, there are

10:45.383 --> 10:48.212
some... new things I
would love to tell you

10:48.256 --> 10:51.085
about my life, and I
would just love to...

10:51.128 --> 10:53.000
get 'em out there.

10:53.043 --> 10:55.567
Okay.

10:55.611 --> 10:58.832
Is that why your friend is here?
Moral support?

10:58.875 --> 11:00.616
And you want to talk
about what?

11:00.660 --> 11:02.836
Your suicide attempt?
Your mental health crisis?

11:02.879 --> 11:04.054
How you pushed

11:04.098 --> 11:05.708
some Harvard kid off the roof
and then tried

11:05.752 --> 11:08.450
to plead guilty for some fakakta
reason and went to jail?!

11:08.493 --> 11:11.279
What? You think I don't
have a Google alert
for "Rebecca Bunch"?

11:11.322 --> 11:13.585
You think that I am not
reading the comments section

11:13.629 --> 11:15.587
of the Daily Covina?

11:16.632 --> 11:18.678
So you know
about all this, then?

11:18.721 --> 11:20.244
None of this was a surprise.

11:20.288 --> 11:21.593
I knew you weren't
in great shape

11:21.637 --> 11:23.683
when we saw each other last,
and I was worried.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.730
But when I read you made
an attempt using my pills,

11:27.774 --> 11:29.993
that is exactly
what happened in college.

11:30.037 --> 11:31.560
You just wanted attention.

11:31.603 --> 11:33.780
And as for
the Rooftop Killer,

11:33.823 --> 11:35.477
doing something drastic
for the man you love

11:35.520 --> 11:36.957
is vintage Beckelah.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.481
Oh, did she ever tell you
that in college

11:39.524 --> 11:41.831
she lit her married
boyfriend's house on fire?

11:41.875 --> 11:43.877
Not to mention
the meshuggener

11:43.920 --> 11:45.879
Josh Chan shenanigans.

11:45.922 --> 11:47.881
Or should I say "Chananigans."

11:47.924 --> 11:49.534
:
That's pretty good.

11:51.406 --> 11:53.147
Anyway...
that's all in the past.

11:53.190 --> 11:54.931
It doesn't matter.
What matters is,

11:54.975 --> 11:56.759
despite all
the schmegegge chazzerai,

11:56.803 --> 11:58.326
you still made partner.

11:58.369 --> 12:01.633
You got your name,
finally, on that door.

12:01.677 --> 12:03.679
So somehow all that meshigas

12:03.723 --> 12:07.596
made your career
even better. Right?

12:08.945 --> 12:10.991
Rebecca...

12:11.034 --> 12:13.341
nothing's really changed.

12:13.384 --> 12:15.343
You haven't really changed.

12:15.386 --> 12:18.259
You're still the same
big

12:18.302 --> 12:20.087
Right?

12:23.655 --> 12:25.266
Right.

12:32.621 --> 12:34.318
Okay, Estrella.

12:34.362 --> 12:37.104
First, I'm hungry.

12:37.147 --> 12:39.280
Spaghetti! Lovespaghetti.

12:39.323 --> 12:40.498
Hmm.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.109
Yeah. There it is.

12:42.152 --> 12:43.937
Find the stuff.

12:50.508 --> 12:52.772
Break this up here.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.599
Yeah!

12:54.643 --> 12:55.905
Now, put that there.

12:55.949 --> 12:57.341
All right, in it goes.

12:57.385 --> 12:59.256
Ah.

12:59.300 --> 13:00.562
All right.

13:01.998 --> 13:04.696
Ah. All right.
And we're off!

13:04.740 --> 13:06.698
♪

13:06.742 --> 13:07.961
Yeah!

13:09.310 --> 13:10.441
Yeah!

13:11.442 --> 13:12.922
Ye... Oh, man.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.709
Oh, come on.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.335
:
Oh!

13:35.379 --> 13:37.729
Ugh. It's... wet.

13:48.915 --> 13:50.525
Stay. Yeah.

13:50.568 --> 13:52.527
Ow! Ow. What are you...?

14:01.753 --> 14:03.668
Okay, let's get up to speed.

14:03.712 --> 14:05.366
I know a bit
about your cases.

14:05.409 --> 14:06.584
Rebecca talks about you a lot.

14:06.628 --> 14:08.586
She kind of talks
about you, too.

14:08.630 --> 14:09.413
Aw.Yeah.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.459
I am so mad at Tanya.

14:11.502 --> 14:13.026
Orange-vested bitch.

14:13.069 --> 14:15.419
Let me know if you want me
to do anything about that

14:15.463 --> 14:16.464
when I get out.

14:16.507 --> 14:18.596
I had an ex-fiancé
who cheated on me,

14:18.640 --> 14:20.163
and, well...

14:20.207 --> 14:24.689
: I put cream cheese
all over his car door handle.

14:26.735 --> 14:27.910
Whoa.

14:27.954 --> 14:29.303
Strong.

14:30.478 --> 14:31.696
No, thank you.

14:31.740 --> 14:33.655
Yeah. Okay,

14:33.698 --> 14:35.613
this is for Nicky.

14:35.657 --> 14:39.661
I thought we could have a party
to celebrate her...

14:39.704 --> 14:41.358
parole!

14:41.402 --> 14:42.751
Where is she?

14:42.794 --> 14:45.014
Well, they just took her
to talk to the warden,

14:45.058 --> 14:45.928
so...

14:45.972 --> 14:47.321
Seriously, just say the word,

14:47.364 --> 14:49.018
and Tanya's mailbox
is filled with--

14:49.062 --> 14:51.325
that's right--
cream cheese.

14:51.368 --> 14:52.804
Okay.

14:52.848 --> 14:54.676
HANIFA:
Nicky.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.330
Whoa, what happened to you?

14:56.373 --> 14:58.245
Who's this?

14:58.288 --> 14:59.681
Rebecca's friend.
Remember?

14:59.724 --> 15:01.422
The one who's not a lawyer?

15:01.465 --> 15:03.815
I need a lawyer right now.

15:05.817 --> 15:07.123
When they were processing
my parole,

15:07.167 --> 15:08.951
they found a warrant
for unpaid parking tickets,

15:08.995 --> 15:10.692
because I failed
to appear in court.

15:10.735 --> 15:13.695
Of courseI failed to appear
in court; I was in here.

15:13.738 --> 15:15.218
And now they gave me

15:15.262 --> 15:17.786
$5,000 worth of fines
that I can't pay.

15:17.829 --> 15:20.876
What am I gonna do?

15:22.051 --> 15:24.140
PAULA: No, no, no, this is ridiculous.

15:24.184 --> 15:26.447
I have beenon hold with
the public defender's office

15:26.490 --> 15:27.665
for 30 minutes already!

15:27.709 --> 15:30.668
No, d...

15:37.066 --> 15:39.416
How was everyone's weekend?

15:40.678 --> 15:42.332
I went to a pumpkin patch
with my mom.

15:42.376 --> 15:43.725
She was a little surprised
by the invite,

15:43.768 --> 15:46.119
but I have a cute photo.

15:47.685 --> 15:49.861
Ask to see the photo.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.341
Uh, can we...Uh...

15:51.385 --> 15:53.343
can we see the photo?may I please see

15:53.387 --> 15:55.041
your photograph?That'd be great.

15:55.084 --> 15:56.694
What the hell's going on?

15:56.738 --> 15:58.305
: We don't know
what's wrong with him.

15:58.348 --> 16:00.133
Just play it cool.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.786
Aw, no. Screw this.

16:01.830 --> 16:03.310
Uh, uh...

16:04.572 --> 16:05.703
Here, check it out.

16:05.747 --> 16:07.879
Mm.So whimsical, right?

16:07.923 --> 16:09.359
:
Yeah.That's very whimsical.

16:09.403 --> 16:11.274
Paula! Pumpkin photo!

16:12.493 --> 16:14.799
Paula, get in here
right now, or else!

16:14.843 --> 16:16.018
Don't fire her! Please!

16:16.062 --> 16:18.455
I'm not firing anyone.

16:18.499 --> 16:20.240
What is wrong with you guys?

16:20.283 --> 16:21.850
You said "or else"!

16:21.893 --> 16:25.158
Yeah, or elseshe's gonna
miss out on all the fun.

16:25.201 --> 16:26.507
Come on.

16:26.550 --> 16:28.422
Why doesn't anyone believe
that I'm nice now?

16:28.465 --> 16:30.641
I am. Okay? I'm nice.

16:30.685 --> 16:32.730
I just sent you all
massage gift cards.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.297
Check your phones.

16:34.341 --> 16:36.560
Look at 'em.
Look at your phones!

16:36.604 --> 16:39.346
What is Paula doing, anyway?

16:47.789 --> 16:50.400
Morning.

16:50.444 --> 16:52.707
Hi-eee.

16:58.756 --> 17:00.410
Oh...

17:00.454 --> 17:03.152
I have a date with Jason
when I get back.

17:03.196 --> 17:06.634
Mmm.I have an actual date.
Look at me.

17:06.677 --> 17:08.201
I am.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.725
Oh. Okay.

17:10.768 --> 17:13.771
All right.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.904
I got to go...Mm.

17:15.947 --> 17:17.862
...see Naomi. Oh.

17:17.906 --> 17:22.345
Mm. I'm so glad that I'm staying
here and not with her, you know?

17:22.389 --> 17:24.956
It's just... it's just
so much, uh, easier

17:25.000 --> 17:26.915
and more convenient.
Sorry.

17:26.958 --> 17:28.264
You telling her
the truth today?

17:28.308 --> 17:30.397
Yes. Because honesty
is important to me.

17:30.440 --> 17:31.876
Mm-hmm.
Oh, also,
could I borrow

17:31.920 --> 17:34.096
a dress? She will hate
everything I brought.

17:36.925 --> 17:39.101
♪

17:39.145 --> 17:41.277
NAOMI:
Wow!

17:41.321 --> 17:42.757
You look great!

17:42.800 --> 17:44.063
You borrowed that dress

17:44.106 --> 17:46.500
from that skinny friend
of yours?No.

17:46.543 --> 17:48.154
Wait. I'm honest now.

17:48.197 --> 17:49.807
Yes.

17:49.851 --> 17:52.506
Whoa, boy.

♪

18:11.525 --> 18:13.570

18:15.006 --> 18:15.920
Audra.

Rebecca, my dear, how are you?

18:17.835 --> 18:20.011
You haven't seen Audra
in a while, have you?

18:20.055 --> 18:21.665
Well,

18:21.709 --> 18:23.232
here she is.

18:23.276 --> 18:25.321
She's having triplets.
All boys.

18:25.365 --> 18:26.931
She and David
had to move into

18:26.975 --> 18:29.891
an even bigger
Tribeca apartment.

18:29.934 --> 18:32.154
Mother, I can speak for myself.

looks good.

Uh, so, do we know
if Elayne Boosler

18:59.877 --> 19:02.184
has any dietary
restrictions?

19:02.228 --> 19:04.230
Yeah, she never
got back to us.

19:04.273 --> 19:06.406
She e-mailed me.
She's allergic to
dairy, of course.

19:06.449 --> 19:07.798

Jewish.

something to wear yet?

19:12.238 --> 19:14.805
I could lend you something.

19:14.849 --> 19:18.679
Or there's a wonderful new
consignment store in Rye.

19:18.722 --> 19:21.203
Oh, Marilyn, don't you worry.
I found something gorgeous.

19:21.247 --> 19:22.335
Size two.

You know, I think
it's so wonderful

19:25.425 --> 19:26.991
that you can bring Rebecca.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.776
Since neither of you
have husbands.

19:28.819 --> 19:30.734
Well, Rebecca's had
yourhusband.REBECCA: Okay,

19:30.778 --> 19:31.953
ladies, do
we have to be

19:31.996 --> 19:34.216
so catty all the time

19:34.260 --> 19:36.131
I'm very happy for these
two about their husbands.

19:36.175 --> 19:37.872
Audra's husband has
a small penis,

19:37.915 --> 19:39.743
and Marilyn's husband
has droopy testicles.

19:41.049 --> 19:42.093
I'm not saying

19:42.137 --> 19:44.139
how I know this, but, uh...

19:44.183 --> 19:47.142
I may also know that he
likes having them tickled.

19:48.274 --> 19:50.058
What?

19:59.285 --> 20:00.286
Tim!

20:00.329 --> 20:01.809
Jim!

20:04.290 --> 20:05.465
Baseball is fun.

20:05.508 --> 20:07.206
I like lemonade. Do you?

20:07.249 --> 20:09.120
Guys, where's Paula?
She's AWOL again.

20:09.164 --> 20:11.645
I don't know.She's not
at the county jail

20:11.688 --> 20:15.214
doing pro bono work for inmates
while she's on the clock.

20:20.219 --> 20:23.178
I-I said she's not.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.789
This is why I don't
tell you my secrets.

20:30.272 --> 20:32.840
Oh. Hey, Josh.Hey, Darryl.

20:32.883 --> 20:34.363
I was just walking
by with Hebby,

20:34.407 --> 20:36.235
and I thought maybe Rebecca
might want to see her,

20:36.278 --> 20:38.237
: since, well...
since she's never acknowledged

20:38.280 --> 20:40.587
or spent time with
her genetic offspring.

20:40.630 --> 20:42.415
Well, she's out of town.

20:44.460 --> 20:47.289
Jiminy Christmas!

20:47.333 --> 20:49.813
What's happened here?

20:49.857 --> 20:51.162
Oh, Josh.

20:51.206 --> 20:53.339
Oh, this is sopping wet!

20:53.382 --> 20:55.515
Yeah, yeah, it is.
Apparently, comforters take,

20:55.558 --> 20:57.647
like, a million dryer cycles.

20:57.691 --> 20:58.866
Mm

20:58.909 --> 21:01.172
Darryl, I was so excited
to be on my own,

21:01.216 --> 21:03.349
but I don't know
how to do anything.

21:03.392 --> 21:06.265
I'm just...
dumb-dumb-dummy Josh.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.223
Josh, calm down.
It's okay.

21:08.267 --> 21:09.703
This happened to me
when I got divorced.

21:09.746 --> 21:12.096
I'd never lived on my own
without a woman either.

21:12.140 --> 21:13.184
You can do it.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.317
Really?
Will you help me?

21:15.361 --> 21:17.188

22:36.485 --> 22:37.878
Nathaniel, look, I'm sorry.

22:37.921 --> 22:39.314
I should have told you
I was here.

22:39.358 --> 22:41.316
And, yes, I was
skipping out

22:41.360 --> 22:43.318
on company time, but it was
for a very good reason...

22:43.362 --> 22:45.276
You must be Nicky. Hello.

22:45.320 --> 22:47.366
I'm Nathaniel Plimpton III.
I'd like to represent you.

22:49.498 --> 22:51.282
You want to be my lawyer?

22:51.326 --> 22:52.109
Mm-hmm.

22:52.153 --> 22:53.372
With that hair

22:53.415 --> 22:55.504
and that name and that suit?

22:55.548 --> 22:56.679

who wants to see

23:06.646 --> 23:09.039
Oh. Okay.

23:11.868 --> 23:13.914
God, Mom, those women,

23:13.957 --> 23:15.829
they're so mean.

23:15.872 --> 23:17.483
Of course they're mean.

23:17.526 --> 23:19.006
Do you think the world

Jewish women's charities

23:20.616 --> 23:22.792
is a warm, cozy place?

23:22.836 --> 23:24.533
Anyway,
this week,

23:24.577 --> 23:27.362
it doesn't bother me,
because I am

23:27.406 --> 23:29.451
being honored.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.105
For one day, I'll be on top.

23:31.148 --> 23:32.498
Ooh.

23:32.541 --> 23:33.629
Got an e-mail.

23:33.673 --> 23:35.457
You get notifications
for e

23:35.501 --> 23:37.328
That's how e-mails work,
Rebecca.

23:37.372 --> 23:38.417
Oh, no.

23:38.460 --> 23:40.070
These letters are so small.

23:40.114 --> 23:41.463
I can't read this.
What does it say?

23:41.507 --> 23:43.552
Right. Wow, these
letters are... huge.

23:43.596 --> 23:46.337
Oh, just read it.
Okay.

23:46.381 --> 23:49.689
So, it's from Elayne
Boosler's assistant.

23:49.732 --> 23:51.821
Uh-huh.

23:51.865 --> 23:54.563
It says, "Elayne
does not remember you.

23:54.607 --> 23:57.392
Please stop inundating
us with e-mails."

23:57.436 --> 23:59.481
Mom.

23:59.525 --> 24:02.353
Oh, you said she was coming.
You told everyone.

24:02.397 --> 24:05.531
We hadn't exactly
connected yet,: Oh, God.

24:05.574 --> 24:07.141
but I was sure
that she would show up.

24:07.184 --> 24:08.664
I mean, she's
a Camp Kavetcha girl.

24:08.708 --> 24:10.536
It's in the camp song.

24:10.579 --> 24:13.669
We stick together.

24:13.713 --> 24:15.541
Yeah, well,
clearly not this time.

24:16.585 --> 24:19.022
Oh, my God.

24:20.589 --> 24:23.549
Okay, Mom, I have an idea.

24:24.724 --> 24:27.030
I'll introduce you, hmm?

24:27.074 --> 24:29.468
Yeah. I'll say nice things.

24:29.511 --> 24:31.208
I'll write a whole speech.

24:32.993 --> 24:34.473
You're no Elayne Boosler.

24:34.516 --> 24:36.039
No.

24:36.083 --> 24:38.041
But...

24:38.085 --> 24:39.782
I'm your daughter,

24:39.826 --> 24:41.523
and...

24:41.567 --> 24:43.743
I'm proud of you.

24:43.786 --> 24:45.571
You giving the speech.

24:45.614 --> 24:48.008
Well...

24:48.051 --> 24:50.619
you are a partner
in your own law firm.

24:51.664 --> 24:54.405
Mm-hmm. Yeah. Okay.

24:54.449 --> 24:55.798
Oh, boy.

24:55.842 --> 24:58.497
All right, now that you
brought it up, uh, Mom,

24:58.540 --> 25:01.500
I was really hoping to tell you
something when you were up here,

25:01.543 --> 25:03.414
but now you're more here.
But maybe that's good,

25:03.458 --> 25:06.330
because you and I can live
in the reality of my life

25:06.374 --> 25:08.550
and your life.

25:08.594 --> 25:11.510
Okay? Um, Mom...

25:12.598 --> 25:14.861
...I'm not a lawyer anymore.

25:18.255 --> 25:19.561
You got disbarred?

25:19.605 --> 25:22.564
No. No.

25:23.609 --> 25:25.306
I quit.

25:25.349 --> 25:27.700
It was always something
you wanted for me.

25:27.743 --> 25:29.615
It was never what I
wanted for myself.

25:29.658 --> 25:31.617
Ever.

25:31.660 --> 25:35.621
And now...

25:35.664 --> 25:38.537
I run a small, unprofitable
pretzel stand.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.627
And I'm happy.

25:43.411 --> 25:45.587
:
Okay.

25:45.631 --> 25:47.720
So, let's just sit
with that for a minute.

25:56.772 --> 25:57.904
I don't know
if this helps,

25:57.947 --> 25:59.296
but it feels really
good to tell you.

25:59.340 --> 26:00.646
Because now I
can be myself,

26:00.689 --> 26:03.257

up a facade all night.

26:03.300 --> 26:04.432

a valid point.

29:08.268 --> 29:10.444
Is this what fuzzy is?Oh, please.

29:10.487 --> 29:12.359
What you just did is
white savior crap.

29:12.402 --> 29:16.406
You can't just sweep in here
and use your checkbook...

29:16.450 --> 29:18.278
I'm actually fine with it.

29:18.321 --> 29:19.801
Yeah, me, too. I just felt
like I should say it.

29:19.845 --> 29:21.194
Nicky, you're free!

29:21.237 --> 29:23.196
Oh, I feel like I took
a bath in honey.

29:23.239 --> 29:25.285
I'm almost turned on.

29:25.328 --> 29:27.200
Yeah, they take
cash and check.Right.

29:27.243 --> 29:29.332
So run downstairs
and pay.Yes.

29:29.376 --> 29:31.465
Grab my notes.Yeah. Run, run.

29:34.468 --> 29:36.252
Rebecca.What?

29:36.296 --> 29:37.471
Stick to the script, okay?

29:37.514 --> 29:39.299
Yeah, lie my face off.
I got it.

29:39.342 --> 29:40.561
Always so dramatic.

29:40.604 --> 29:42.389
Shalom!

29:47.437 --> 29:48.656
Hey. Is everything okay?

29:48.699 --> 29:50.310
Hey, Becks!
Uh, was just wondering

29:50.353 --> 29:52.399
if you needed me to do anything
before you came home.

29:52.442 --> 29:54.401
Turns out I'm good
at domestic stuff.

29:54.444 --> 29:55.576
It's not that hard.

29:55.619 --> 29:57.360
You just use Common's sense,

29:57.404 --> 29:59.449
and he's my favorite rapper.

29:59.493 --> 30:01.669
I'm sorry. This trip is a mess,
and I just--

30:01.712 --> 30:03.584
I got to find a way
to get through it somehow.

30:03.627 --> 30:05.847
I came here to tell the truth
to one Jewish mother,

30:05.891 --> 30:07.849
and now I'm lying
to a room full of them.

30:07.893 --> 30:10.069
Oh. Becks, I'm sorry.

30:10.112 --> 30:11.244
No, i-it's fine.
Uh, I got to go.

30:11.287 --> 30:12.680
See you soon. Bye.

30:12.723 --> 30:14.421
Okay.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.118
Bye.

30:17.119 --> 30:18.904
Josh, I'm so impressed.

30:18.947 --> 30:20.601
It really does
look nice in here.

30:20.644 --> 30:22.472
Oh. It was a
lot of work.

30:22.516 --> 30:24.213
Yeah. Well, it turns out
that's what being an adult is.

30:24.257 --> 30:25.258
Lots of work.

30:25.301 --> 30:26.912
She sounds so sad.

30:26.955 --> 30:29.436
I really want to do
something nice for her.

30:29.479 --> 30:31.307
I mean, she let me stay here.

30:31.351 --> 30:34.484
Well, you could get her
some flowers or candy.

30:34.528 --> 30:36.486
Well, I saw something
on Quimblepop

30:36.530 --> 30:38.097
I think she'd really like.

30:39.141 --> 30:40.664
Okay, she
loves autumn,

30:40.708 --> 30:43.276
and they have these murals
at the paint store.

30:43.319 --> 30:44.886
It's really easy.
All I have to do

30:44.930 --> 30:46.279
is pre-trim the image,

30:46.322 --> 30:48.281
measure and etch guidelines
onto the wall,

30:48.324 --> 30:50.109
apply the paste,
double-cut the seams,

30:50.152 --> 30:51.893
put up the panels,
trim the overage,

30:51.937 --> 30:54.330
remove the excess paste,
and voilà!

30:54.374 --> 30:56.158
Josh, you just learned how
to use tinfoil.

30:56.202 --> 30:57.420
No, you're wrong, okay?

30:57.464 --> 30:58.595
I'm a new man.

30:58.639 --> 31:00.423
I can do stuff.

31:00.467 --> 31:01.511
Ask Estrella.

31:04.819 --> 31:06.386
Oh.

31:06.429 --> 31:08.388
On my way to the paint store,

31:08.431 --> 31:11.391
I'll stop by the pet store.

31:17.092 --> 31:18.659
Mm.

31:18.702 --> 31:21.357
So sad about Elayne Boosler.

31:21.401 --> 31:22.532
AUDRA:
Oh.

31:22.576 --> 31:23.533
You know, I personally

31:23.577 --> 31:24.926
never thought she was coming.

31:24.970 --> 31:27.276
Well...

31:27.320 --> 31:28.887
I have better than Boosler.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.279
I have my daughter.

31:30.323 --> 31:31.890
Big-shot lawyer.

31:31.933 --> 31:33.108
Oh.Sure.

31:33.152 --> 31:34.544
Mm.

31:38.984 --> 31:41.812
Uh, hello, everyone. Welcome.
Shalom, shalom, shalom.

31:41.856 --> 31:45.381
I am, uh, thrilled to be here

31:45.425 --> 31:47.470
at this event
honoring my mother.

31:47.514 --> 31:49.342
I would like

31:49.385 --> 31:51.779
to start out by telling you
a little bit about myself

31:51.822 --> 31:55.435
and what a great influence

31:55.478 --> 31:57.437
my mother has had

31:57.480 --> 32:00.527
on my life and my, uh...

32:00.570 --> 32:02.529
career.

32:04.357 --> 32:06.054
:
Is that...?

32:07.316 --> 32:09.405
Uh, ladies, I-I, uh...

32:09.449 --> 32:11.581
I will be right back.

32:11.625 --> 32:13.192
Please excuse me for one moment.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.588
What? Elayne Boosler.
How did you...?

32:18.632 --> 32:20.764
I called,
said if she didn't show up,

32:20.808 --> 32:22.462
you were gonna have
to go out there and lie

32:22.505 --> 32:25.595
and undo a lot of the work
you've done on yourself.That's bull.

32:25.639 --> 32:27.597
She promised me another gig
her company is doing,

32:27.641 --> 32:30.122
a Radio City benefit
for some Internet weenie.

32:30.165 --> 32:32.515
The pay is great.

32:32.559 --> 32:35.083
Wait, do you actually know
my mother?

32:35.127 --> 32:36.737
Of course. Naomi-Know-It-All.

32:36.780 --> 32:39.479
Then why didn't you respond
to her e

32:39.522 --> 32:42.003
Have youmet your mother?
She's a pain in the kishkes.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.397
Who wants to do a favor
for that?

32:44.440 --> 32:48.009
That's a good point.
I owe you one.

32:48.053 --> 32:50.533
Oh, sorry about that, ladies.

32:50.577 --> 32:52.013
You know, I could stand here

32:52.057 --> 32:53.536
and talk to you all night,

32:53.580 --> 32:56.322
but wouldn't you rather
hear from...

32:56.365 --> 32:58.454
Elayne Boosler?

32:58.498 --> 32:59.803
She's here?

32:59.847 --> 33:01.980
Elayne is here!

33:02.023 --> 33:03.459
What?

33:05.113 --> 33:07.463
Hello, everybody.
Happy to be here.

33:09.074 --> 33:13.513
Nothing I'd rather do than talk
about my dear, sweet, close,

33:13.556 --> 33:15.471
personal friend Naomi.

33:15.515 --> 33:17.343
Come on up, Naomi.

33:17.386 --> 33:20.520
Oh!

33:20.563 --> 33:22.043
You know, when Naomi reached out

33:22.087 --> 33:23.914
and asked me to talk
tonight, my answer

33:23.958 --> 33:25.612
was an automatic yes,

33:25.655 --> 33:29.877
because Camp Kavetcha girls
are always there for each other.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.444
Elayne, I'm so thrilled
to see you.

33:31.487 --> 33:32.880
Thank you for coming.Of course.

33:32.923 --> 33:34.490
Are we gonna sing the song?You bet your pupik

33:34.534 --> 33:36.057
we're gonna sing
that damned song.

33:36.101 --> 33:37.798
Yes! You ready?

33:37.841 --> 33:39.060

Wow, that song was dead-on

34:58.966 --> 35:00.141
And so, after the camp song,

35:00.185 --> 35:02.187
then you told everyone
the truth?

35:02.230 --> 35:04.580
Nope. Nuh-uh.Mm-mm.

35:04.624 --> 35:08.541
No one. I thought about it,
but then it hit me.

35:08.584 --> 35:11.979
I don't need to tell everyone
everything all the time.

35:12.022 --> 35:13.285
I mean, really,

35:13.328 --> 35:15.896
using my mug shot
as my dating profile pic?

35:15.939 --> 35:17.941
What's

35:17.985 --> 35:20.292
I mean, I don't need
outside approval

35:20.335 --> 35:22.990
from others, and I certainly
don't need outside judgment

35:23.033 --> 35:25.732
from people
I frankly don't care about.

35:26.776 --> 35:28.778
I know who I am now.

35:28.822 --> 35:31.172
Finally.

35:31.216 --> 35:33.348
It's so freeing.

35:33.392 --> 35:34.958
I'll get it.

35:38.092 --> 35:40.050
Mom?

35:40.094 --> 35:42.618
We showed everyone, huh
Oh, hello, Valencia.

35:42.662 --> 35:44.664
And girlfriend.
Wow, are you cute.

35:44.707 --> 35:47.580
Like your hair.
We're friends now.

35:47.623 --> 35:48.929
Okay. I...

35:48.972 --> 35:51.149
Mom, what are you
doing here?

35:51.192 --> 35:53.760
We need to talk
about your career at the firm.

35:53.803 --> 35:55.675
What? I don't work at a firm.But you will.

35:55.718 --> 35:56.763
I scheduled
a conference call with them.

35:56.806 --> 35:59.461
It's called
Mountain something now.

35:59.505 --> 36:01.811
Anyway, I reached a senior
partner, Bert Buttenweiser.

36:01.855 --> 36:03.248
Nice man.

36:03.291 --> 36:05.293
Told me all about
his seven dead sisters.

36:05.337 --> 36:06.947
Wait, wait, Mom,
what did you do?

36:06.990 --> 36:09.428
He said that he will take you
back if that's what you wanted,

36:09.471 --> 36:11.821
that they could use you,
and then I asked

36:11.865 --> 36:13.345
if you could be partner again,
of course,

36:13.388 --> 36:14.650
and he said absolu...Enough!

36:14.694 --> 36:15.869
Wow.

36:15.912 --> 36:17.914
That's enough.

36:22.789 --> 36:24.356
So, I took a look
at Hanifa's case,

36:24.399 --> 36:26.271
and I have some thoughts
on that, as well.Okay.

36:26.314 --> 36:30.579
Hold on. Why are you doing this?
This nice kick,

36:30.623 --> 36:32.190
is this just another scheme
to get Rebecca back?

36:32.233 --> 36:34.540
Is that what you think?

36:34.583 --> 36:35.976
That's what
the whole office thinks.

36:37.195 --> 36:38.761
Hundo "P."

36:40.807 --> 36:43.288
Maybe it started that way.

36:43.331 --> 36:44.898
When she and I split up
for good,

36:44.941 --> 36:47.770
she said some tough things
about me,

36:47.814 --> 36:50.382
and they were true.

36:50.425 --> 36:51.992
She was right.

36:52.035 --> 36:54.951
So I decided
to try and be nicer,

36:54.995 --> 36:57.911
but, um, pumpkin photos
don't cut it.

36:57.954 --> 37:00.740
And now I know

37:00.783 --> 37:02.785
that there's stuff I can do.

37:02.829 --> 37:04.874
And I like it.

37:04.918 --> 37:07.094
Okay.

37:07.137 --> 37:09.662
Okay. I buy all that.

37:09.705 --> 37:13.448
Also, it turns out there is
a shocking amount of unfairness

37:13.492 --> 37:16.190
in the legal system.
Did you know that?

37:16.234 --> 37:17.452
No, I didn't.

37:18.323 --> 37:19.889
No one did.

37:19.933 --> 37:21.456
Thank God you figured it out.

37:21.500 --> 37:23.023
Yeah.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.897
Mom, it's over.Excuse me?

37:27.941 --> 37:31.640
It's over. The old Rebecca
let you manipulate her,

37:31.684 --> 37:33.686
but not anymore. I don't
want your opinion anymore.

37:33.729 --> 37:35.775
I don't want your opinion
on my career,

37:35.818 --> 37:38.778
on my hair, on my clothes,
on my love life.

37:38.821 --> 37:40.258
Nothing.

37:40.301 --> 37:42.303
They are mychoices,

37:42.347 --> 37:46.002
and as of right now,
they are off-limits to you.

37:46.046 --> 37:48.309
Okay? So, look,

37:48.353 --> 37:50.006
we can chat,
we can still gossip,

37:50.050 --> 37:51.660
we can kibitz,
we can go out for a schmear,

37:51.704 --> 37:52.792
but that's it.

37:52.835 --> 37:54.707
I wish we could hide
in the other room,

37:54.750 --> 37:56.317
but there isn't one.

37:56.361 --> 37:58.450
I am so proud of her.

37:58.493 --> 38:01.540
I can't look 'cause I'm
Waspy, but so proud.

38:01.583 --> 38:04.282
Now, you respect me
and my boundaries,

38:04.325 --> 38:07.546
or we will have no relationship
at all.

38:08.764 --> 38:10.810
Do I make myself clear?

38:12.855 --> 38:15.162
Crystal.

38:26.652 --> 38:31.178
Hello. I'm back from Jew Hell.

38:31.221 --> 38:32.962
Which is nothing,

38:33.006 --> 38:35.661
'cause Jews don't technically
believe in Hell...

38:35.704 --> 38:37.880
Oh, wow!

38:37.924 --> 38:40.927
Oh, look at that. Josh.

38:40.970 --> 38:45.105
Autumn. Oh, my God,
did you do that yourself?

38:45.148 --> 38:47.020
Uh, I-I want to say yes,

38:47.063 --> 38:48.717
but I know
you're big on honesty,

38:48.761 --> 38:50.893
so the truth is someone else

38:50.937 --> 38:55.115
put it up after I glued my feet
to the floor by accident.

38:55.158 --> 38:56.377
Also, I killed Estrella,

38:56.421 --> 38:58.031
and I got a new
one. I'm so sorry.

38:58.074 --> 38:59.119
Oh, don't worry about that.

38:59.162 --> 39:00.207
That's, like,
the fourth Estrella.

39:00.250 --> 39:02.296
And hey, hey,
Heather doesn't know,

39:02.340 --> 39:03.993
and she never will.

39:04.037 --> 39:05.604
Yeah.

39:05.647 --> 39:08.041
God.

39:08.084 --> 39:11.566
Well, I-I should go. Um,
I have to get to the YMCA early

39:11.610 --> 39:13.394
to get a good room, so...Hey, Josh.

39:13.438 --> 39:16.397
Don't go to the Y.
Just stay here.

39:16.441 --> 39:18.268
Move in.Uh, really?

39:18.312 --> 39:20.270
Us

39:20.314 --> 39:22.577
I mean, do you think
that's a good idea?

39:22.621 --> 39:24.666
I think most people
in the world won't

39:24.710 --> 39:26.886
think that's
a good idea. Like...

39:26.929 --> 39:28.322
no one.

39:28.366 --> 39:31.107
True. But you know what?

39:31.151 --> 39:33.109
I no longer care
what other people think.

39:34.154 --> 39:36.199
Screw 'em.

39:36.243 --> 39:38.985
Okay, then. I'd love to.

39:39.028 --> 39:41.204
Then it's settled. Okay.

39:41.248 --> 39:43.119
Oh, I have a date
to get ready for.

39:43.163 --> 39:44.947
Let's see where the place is.

39:47.994 --> 39:49.604
Oh, no.

39:49.648 --> 39:52.172
Oh, man, Jason canceled.

39:52.215 --> 39:53.086
I mean, okay,

39:53.129 --> 39:55.436
he says he's sick, but...

39:55.480 --> 39:58.221
he canceled
on super short notice,

39:58.265 --> 40:01.094
so that means...Aw, sorry. Yeah.

40:01.137 --> 40:03.139
That's such a bummer.
I was really looking forward

40:03.183 --> 40:04.358
to having plans tonight.

40:04.402 --> 40:07.840
But you do have plans.

40:07.883 --> 40:09.145
What are you doing?

40:13.193 --> 40:15.891
Mmm. Oh, no.

40:15.935 --> 40:17.589
It's too hot!

40:17.632 --> 40:20.635
Oh, this is so nice. Thank you.

40:20.679 --> 40:22.855
Sometimes I forget
how nice you can be.

40:22.898 --> 40:25.118
Yeah. Sometimes
I'm not too terrible.

Rebecca?

Rebecca?

40:49.534 --> 40:51.666
Did you hear what I said?

40:52.711 --> 40:54.408
I did not. I'm sorry.

40:54.452 --> 40:57.063
Paula, the weirdest thing
happened last night.

40:57.106 --> 40:59.195
So, Josh and I were
in our kitchen... Oh.What?

40:59.239 --> 41:00.806
Josh is living with me,

41:00.849 --> 41:02.764
by the way, but that's not
the weird thing.It's not?

41:02.808 --> 41:05.245
No. So, I looked at him, and...

41:05.288 --> 41:07.247
these images

41:07.290 --> 41:09.771
just started flashing and...

41:09.815 --> 41:12.774
Before my eyes,
and it was...

41:12.818 --> 41:15.560
Oh, honey, I'm sorry. You're
gonna have to tell me later.

41:15.603 --> 41:18.258
Nathaniel and I have a hearing
in Hanifa's case.

41:18.301 --> 41:19.433
What?

41:19.477 --> 41:21.087
Yeah, uh...

41:22.305 --> 41:23.481
:
Okay.

41:23.524 --> 41:25.047
He didn't want me to tell you,

41:25.091 --> 41:26.353
but Nathaniel

41:26.396 --> 41:27.876
has come on to help out
with some of your cases.

41:27.920 --> 41:29.487
And I got to say,

41:29.530 --> 41:31.227
I've spent a lot of time with
him the last couple of days,

41:31.271 --> 41:33.012
and he's like a different guy.

41:33.055 --> 41:34.883
Yeah. He's, like,
a good person.

41:34.927 --> 41:37.190
Just doing the right thing.
