WEBVTT

01:48.586 --> 01:50.762
<i>There's nothing we can do.</i>

01:50.849 --> 01:54.766
We can't warp away.
We can't stop the signal.

01:54.853 --> 01:56.507
It's annihilation.

01:56.594 --> 02:00.294
There is one thing we can do.

02:00.381 --> 02:02.209
We have to destroy
the Protostar.

02:03.427 --> 02:05.125
We can't destroy our ship!

02:05.212 --> 02:06.517
It's the only surefire way

02:06.604 --> 02:08.215
to stop the long-range
subspace signal.

02:08.302 --> 02:09.129
No!

02:09.216 --> 02:10.608
We can't destroy our ship

02:10.695 --> 02:12.784
'cause if our Proto-Core blows,

02:12.871 --> 02:15.787
everything in a 50 million
miles radius goes with it.

02:15.874 --> 02:18.877
Not even Murf can survive
a supernova warp breach.

02:18.964 --> 02:20.531
Jankom's correct.

02:20.618 --> 02:22.359
Destabilizing the Proto-Core
would create

02:22.446 --> 02:24.666
a veritable supernova so large,

02:24.753 --> 02:27.147
only a Proto-Warp could
get us that far away.

02:27.234 --> 02:28.974
- Hmm.
- And even then--

02:29.061 --> 02:33.153
Unless we destabilize it at
the exact moment we Proto-Jump.

02:33.240 --> 02:35.677
The destructive energy released
would be spread

02:35.764 --> 02:37.635
across space-time.
- Hmm.

02:37.722 --> 02:39.985
I know we just got
our translators working,

02:40.072 --> 02:41.900
but could someone
explain that to me?

02:41.987 --> 02:43.772
Rok-Tahk's correct.

02:43.859 --> 02:46.253
Estimating the Proto-Core's
remaining power,

02:46.340 --> 02:48.298
an explosion of that magnitude
could wipe out

02:48.385 --> 02:51.997
this entire star system.

02:52.084 --> 02:55.349
But elongate that damage
across dozens of lightyears

02:55.436 --> 02:56.654
in a short frame and--

02:56.741 --> 02:58.613
The destruction here
is minimal.

02:58.700 --> 03:00.136
No one else gets hurt.

03:00.223 --> 03:01.833
No one else? Slow down!

03:01.920 --> 03:03.400
Pog isn't sure
he likes this plan.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.185
We can make a shuttlecraft

03:05.272 --> 03:08.492
with the Vehicle Replicator
and eject before detonation.

03:08.579 --> 03:14.019
Except the Protostar's
auto-controls are fried.

03:14.106 --> 03:16.326
Someone will have
to stay back to detonate it.

03:19.373 --> 03:20.765
I am the captain of this ship.

03:20.852 --> 03:22.376
No, Dal.

03:22.463 --> 03:25.944
Admiral Janeway
is true to her word.

03:26.031 --> 03:28.643
She'll help you get
into Starfleet,

03:28.730 --> 03:30.645
but she can't help me.

03:30.732 --> 03:33.648
Or you let
the hologram do it.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.389
When you were trapped
in the Holodeck,

03:35.476 --> 03:38.696
you did grant me
your command codes.

03:38.783 --> 03:41.177
But you're not
just a hologram to us.

03:41.264 --> 03:44.006
You've got memories,
a personality--

03:44.093 --> 03:46.356
you're our friend.

03:46.443 --> 03:49.707
And that's why you'll
make a copy of my program

03:49.794 --> 03:52.449
on an isolinear chip
and bring me with you,

03:52.536 --> 03:56.410
that way I can be
in two places at once.

03:56.497 --> 03:57.672
How soon until we can jump?

03:57.759 --> 04:00.022
It'd take any engineer
at least a day,

04:00.109 --> 04:01.415
but--

04:01.502 --> 04:02.938
Jankom ain't any engineer.

04:07.159 --> 04:10.032
All right, let's get moving.
Get impulse online.

04:10.119 --> 04:11.686
If our math's fuzzy,

04:11.773 --> 04:13.644
it'd be nice to have
a little breathing room.

04:28.180 --> 04:28.920
What are they doing?

04:33.969 --> 04:36.188
Saving us all.

04:49.767 --> 04:52.553
Jankom, how we doing
on that razzle-dazzle?

04:52.640 --> 04:54.119
She's primed
and ready to jump--

04:54.206 --> 04:56.208
jump and explode, that is.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.254
Jankom's not just an engineer,

04:58.341 --> 05:00.691
he's a miracle worker.

05:00.778 --> 05:04.216
Great.
We've got one shot at this.

05:04.304 --> 05:06.262
With so little time,

05:06.349 --> 05:09.265
we left out all comfort
for basic life support.

05:09.352 --> 05:12.616
We have stabilizers,
but the engines are crude.

05:12.703 --> 05:15.489
Its navigation is archaic.

05:15.576 --> 05:17.839
- We have Janeway for that.
- Right.

05:17.926 --> 05:20.972
Seats--oh,
what about the seats?

05:21.059 --> 05:23.758
We leave in five.
Maybe seat belts.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.890
Forget belts.
We'll just go

05:25.977 --> 05:28.023
with the hold-onto-your-butt
grab handles.

05:31.592 --> 05:34.551
<i>Uploading holo-program.</i>

05:34.638 --> 05:37.249
<i>Insufficient capacity.</i>

05:41.863 --> 05:44.431
How's it coming?
Did you copy your program?

05:44.518 --> 05:45.823
Is everything okay?

05:52.395 --> 05:54.789
Watch out.
Now you'll have two of me.

05:59.315 --> 06:00.534
It's time to go.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.233
Thank you, security officer.

06:04.320 --> 06:06.148
I'll take it from here.

06:06.235 --> 06:09.499
Computer, place all controls
under my authority

06:09.586 --> 06:11.327
and maintain this course.

06:11.414 --> 06:13.851
<i>Affirmative.</i>

06:13.938 --> 06:17.115
All this time,

06:17.202 --> 06:20.989
all the love we put into it and
we're just gonna blow it up.

06:21.076 --> 06:23.121
I-it just doesn't feel right.

06:23.208 --> 06:26.037
Think of it as

06:26.124 --> 06:30.259
letting a young star become
what it's meant to be.

06:37.092 --> 06:39.311
We'll see you
on the other side.

06:39.399 --> 06:41.531
Of course you will, Captain.

06:41.618 --> 06:44.012
I just want you all to know

06:44.099 --> 06:47.668
what an honor it was
to serve alongside you.

08:17.540 --> 08:19.586
<i>Proto-Core is online.</i>

08:31.728 --> 08:34.252
On my mark. Ready?

08:35.558 --> 08:36.864
Go fast.

09:24.302 --> 09:26.217
We're no longer locked out.

09:26.304 --> 09:28.393
Any sign of
the USS Protostar?

09:28.480 --> 09:29.917
No, Admiral.

09:30.004 --> 09:30.570
I've tracked
their warp signature,

09:30.657 --> 09:32.963
but read no signs of life.

09:33.050 --> 09:34.965
- Send a search party.
- But, Admiral,

09:35.052 --> 09:36.750
the distance they crossed--

09:36.837 --> 09:39.535
it would take months
to scan that many star systems.

09:39.622 --> 09:42.016
That crew just
saved Starfleet.

09:42.103 --> 09:44.845
If they're out there,
I want to know.

09:46.760 --> 09:48.849
You got this far.

09:48.936 --> 09:51.852
Wherever you are,
don't give up now.

09:58.423 --> 10:00.077
We did it.

10:00.164 --> 10:03.124
Ooh, Janeway would want
to see this.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.393
Huh?
Why is Janeway tiny?

10:11.480 --> 10:13.221
That's not her hologram.

10:13.308 --> 10:15.136
<i>I bet right now
Jankom is wondering</i>

10:15.223 --> 10:16.877
<i>why I'm not a hologram</i>

10:16.964 --> 10:19.488
<i>and just a prerecorded message.</i>

10:19.575 --> 10:22.360
Uh...

10:22.447 --> 10:25.059
What does she mean,
"prerecorded"?

10:25.146 --> 10:27.801
<i>I imagine
you have questions.</i>

10:27.888 --> 10:30.717
<i>I'm sorry, but I lied to you.</i>

10:30.804 --> 10:33.545
What? I'm so confused.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.983
What's going on?

10:36.070 --> 10:38.072
Where is Janeway?

10:38.159 --> 10:40.204
<i>There was no way
for me to leave.</i>

10:42.032 --> 10:44.948
<i>Over the course of my time
with you, I've grown.</i>

10:45.035 --> 10:48.865
<i>Literally--my program
has become too large,</i>

10:48.952 --> 10:53.478
<i>too rich, and complex
for some tiny, little chip.</i>

10:53.565 --> 10:55.045
<i>It just wasn't possible
to remove me</i>

10:55.132 --> 10:57.657
<i>from the computers in time.</i>

10:57.744 --> 11:02.009
She stayed on the ship, Rok.

11:02.096 --> 11:05.403
- No.
- Janeway.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.667
No.

11:09.451 --> 11:11.453
<i>And knowing how stubborn
you all are,</i>

11:11.540 --> 11:14.586
<i>especially you, Jankom,</i>

11:14.674 --> 11:16.066
<i>I did what I had to,</i>

11:16.153 --> 11:18.721
<i>so that you could
fulfill your potential.</i>

11:18.808 --> 11:23.465
<i>I'm truly proud to have seen
how far you've all come.</i>

11:23.552 --> 11:26.033
<i>My only regret is not
being there when you arrive</i>

11:26.120 --> 11:28.383
<i>at the steps
of Starfleet Academy.</i>

11:30.037 --> 11:32.474
But--but we don't
have navigation!

11:32.561 --> 11:35.390
<i>You may think
you need me to get there,</i>

11:35.477 --> 11:38.436
<i>but after seeing everything
you've accomplished,</i>

11:38.523 --> 11:42.702
<i>I have full confidence
you'll find your way.</i>

11:42.789 --> 11:47.445
<i>Because together,
your potential is infinite.</i>

11:49.578 --> 11:52.886
<i>Now, go boldly.</i>

11:58.369 --> 11:59.980
Janeway.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.420
Always telling us what to do.

12:07.596 --> 12:09.772
Even to the end.

12:21.871 --> 12:23.307
<i>While the ship's crew
is still missing,</i>

12:23.394 --> 12:24.787
<i>we did find this.</i>

12:24.874 --> 12:27.137
<i>When the Protostar
destabilized their core,</i>

12:27.224 --> 12:29.139
while simultaneously
engaging warp,

12:29.226 --> 12:32.142
it not only lessened
the degree of decimation

12:32.229 --> 12:34.449
so as to save others,
but at the point of impact,

12:34.536 --> 12:36.494
it created
an interspatial rift.

12:36.581 --> 12:39.584
Excuse me. A rift?

12:39.671 --> 12:41.499
More specifically,
a wormhole.

12:41.586 --> 12:43.110
From this, one of our stations

12:43.197 --> 12:45.025
picked up a signal
from the Protostar.

12:45.112 --> 12:46.766
The Protostar is gone.

12:46.853 --> 12:50.682
Ah, the one stolen by the
criminals on Tars Lamora, yes.

12:50.770 --> 12:53.468
You mean the heroes
that saved our hides

12:53.555 --> 12:55.687
when we nearly
destroyed ourselves.

12:55.775 --> 12:58.429
In their absence
and in my presence,

12:58.516 --> 13:00.344
they get our respect.

13:00.431 --> 13:02.738
We mean no disrespect, Admiral.

13:02.825 --> 13:05.480
Because of their sacrifice,

13:05.567 --> 13:08.309
we picked up this.

13:10.702 --> 13:13.314
<i>Mayday. Mayday.</i>

13:13.401 --> 13:16.621
- I've already heard this.
- Not this message.

13:16.708 --> 13:18.710
<i>It's day 72
since the Vau N'Akat...</i>

13:18.798 --> 13:20.103
<i>Captured the Protostar.</i>

13:20.190 --> 13:21.365
<i>They're planning
to launch it back</i>

13:21.452 --> 13:22.671
<i>through the wormhole
with a weapon aboard.</i>

13:22.758 --> 13:24.325
This was sent
from another time,

13:24.412 --> 13:26.240
52 years from now.

13:26.327 --> 13:30.200
<i>Half my crew's gone,
but I'm trying to hang on.</i>

13:30.287 --> 13:33.682
How? How is that possible?

13:33.769 --> 13:36.816
The hologram adviser's
last act was to duplicate

13:36.903 --> 13:39.296
the parameters logged
in the original wormhole

13:39.383 --> 13:41.995
Captain Chakotay was lost in.

13:42.082 --> 13:44.911
Thusly, creating
an interspatial flecture

13:44.998 --> 13:47.391
to approximately the same
space-time coordinates

13:47.478 --> 13:48.915
in an alternate future.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.917
He's alive,

13:51.004 --> 13:54.355
and she pointed us
in the right direction.

13:54.442 --> 13:57.662
There are discussions
of sending an exploratory ship.

13:57.749 --> 14:00.056
I want to be on it.

14:00.143 --> 14:03.103
I-I'm sorry for interrupting.

14:03.190 --> 14:05.061
What is it?

14:05.148 --> 14:07.498
Admiral, it's them.

14:37.006 --> 14:39.530
Stealing a Federation ship,

14:39.617 --> 14:43.795
impersonating officers,

14:43.883 --> 14:47.321
even illicitly inhabiting the
mind of an esteemed admiral.

14:47.408 --> 14:50.280
All in an effort to warn us.

14:50.367 --> 14:53.631
The list of offenses would
take me all afternoon to read,

14:53.718 --> 14:55.459
yet you want us
to consider letting them

14:55.546 --> 14:57.505
apply to Starfleet Academy.

14:57.592 --> 14:59.855
Including this augment.

14:59.942 --> 15:02.423
The Academy is not
a space camp for children.

15:02.510 --> 15:04.599
This is a serious
disciplined institution

15:04.686 --> 15:06.209
designed for only
our brightest.

15:06.296 --> 15:08.211
What about the written
and oral tests,

15:08.298 --> 15:09.560
psych evaluations?

15:09.647 --> 15:11.911
This is unprecedented,
even reckless.

15:11.998 --> 15:14.217
Good intentions

15:14.304 --> 15:16.698
do not make up
for Federation crimes.

15:16.785 --> 15:19.135
Good intentions?

15:19.222 --> 15:22.095
I know my prior statements
about my experience

15:22.182 --> 15:24.880
with the accused were
unusual to say the least,

15:24.967 --> 15:28.188
but one year ago,
not one of them had ever heard

15:28.275 --> 15:31.234
of the United Federation
of Planets.

15:31.321 --> 15:35.325
Yet through fate, engineered
by their own ingenuity,

15:35.412 --> 15:37.849
they set their compass
to Starfleet

15:37.937 --> 15:41.462
and without their intervention,
I cannot say with certainty

15:41.549 --> 15:44.291
if all of us would be
sitting here right now.

15:44.378 --> 15:47.337
Go get 'em, Janeway.

15:47.424 --> 15:51.037
The Protostar,
named after the early stage

15:51.124 --> 15:54.475
in the formation of a star,
powered by it,

15:54.562 --> 15:57.260
we designed a ship that could
explore the far reaches

15:57.347 --> 16:00.742
of our understanding
in hope of finding others

16:00.829 --> 16:02.962
who share our ideals,

16:03.049 --> 16:06.400
so that we may create
a stronger alliance.

16:06.487 --> 16:10.317
Stack up those tests,
the psych evaluations,

16:10.404 --> 16:13.537
interviews,
they don't hold a candle

16:13.624 --> 16:15.539
to what this crew
has been through.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.454
And concerning the augment,

16:17.541 --> 16:20.501
whose name
you've conveniently forgotten,

16:20.588 --> 16:23.025
his name Dal R'El.

16:23.112 --> 16:25.245
Is he genetically engineered?

16:25.332 --> 16:27.464
Yes.

16:27.551 --> 16:30.380
Was he enhanced in every way?

16:30.467 --> 16:31.729
Look at him.

16:31.816 --> 16:33.905
Of course not.

16:33.993 --> 16:37.822
But his heart is bigger
than any in this room,

16:37.909 --> 16:40.564
I should know.

16:40.651 --> 16:44.916
The Federation is made up
of over 150 member species.

16:45.004 --> 16:48.659
Dal's DNA includes 26 of those,

16:48.746 --> 16:50.879
so I ask you,

16:50.966 --> 16:53.229
is there a better
living embodiment

16:53.316 --> 16:56.624
of what our alliance
represents?

17:15.643 --> 17:17.688
They've dropped all charges.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.648
We did it, Murf!

17:22.084 --> 17:24.956
What about Starfleet Academy?

17:25.044 --> 17:28.743
After carefully considering
all sides to the argument,

17:28.830 --> 17:31.876
they felt strongly that
fast-tracking non-Federation

17:31.963 --> 17:35.358
citizens into the Academy
wasn't fair to the other

17:35.445 --> 17:38.753
more qualified entrants
currently awaiting their turn,

17:38.840 --> 17:42.931
but I was able to convince them
to permit five of you

17:43.018 --> 17:47.196
to be taken under my wing
as warrant officers in training

17:47.283 --> 17:51.026
under my personal command
of a ship of my choosing.

17:51.113 --> 17:52.897
So we haven't been accepted

17:52.984 --> 17:54.421
into the Academy,

17:54.508 --> 17:56.423
but we are part of Starfleet?

17:56.510 --> 17:58.425
You're gonna be our captain?

17:58.512 --> 18:00.557
In a way.
Welcome aboard.

18:00.644 --> 18:03.734
- Yes!
- Yes! Oh, yeah.

18:03.821 --> 18:06.433
Five?
But there are six of us.

18:06.520 --> 18:08.043
Who didn't get in?

18:10.045 --> 18:12.743
- It's okay, guys.
- Oh, Dal.

18:12.830 --> 18:14.615
What's important is

18:14.702 --> 18:16.965
you get to carry on
this adventure.

18:17.052 --> 18:20.229
Dal, you got in.

18:20.316 --> 18:23.711
What? Me?

18:23.798 --> 18:26.409
I don't understand.

18:33.155 --> 18:34.722
I won't be joining you.

18:34.809 --> 18:36.202
- What?
- I don't understand.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.552
First contact with Solum
hasn't happened yet,

18:38.639 --> 18:40.684
but it will with someone, someday.

18:40.771 --> 18:43.209
Knowing what will happen
to my people,

18:43.296 --> 18:45.515
I have to go.

18:45.602 --> 18:48.170
My father made mistakes,
but he was right.

18:48.257 --> 18:51.130
I need to save the Vau N'Akat
in my own way.

18:51.217 --> 18:55.569
Starfleet has offered aid to
return Gwyn to her home planet.

18:55.656 --> 18:57.919
Maybe hearing
about the greater universe

18:58.006 --> 19:01.401
from one of their own will
open them to a brighter future.

19:01.488 --> 19:04.447
Gwyndala, the Unifier.

19:04.534 --> 19:06.623
I like the sound of that.

19:10.279 --> 19:12.194
Jankom Pog's gonna miss you.

19:14.588 --> 19:17.373
Yeah, we all are.

19:18.679 --> 19:21.377
I'll miss you guys too.

19:21.464 --> 19:22.770
<i>I have the unique privilege</i>

19:22.857 --> 19:24.685
<i>to have grown up
with Starfleet.</i>

19:24.772 --> 19:26.208
<i>But there are parts</i>

19:26.295 --> 19:28.906
<i>of our universe
still unexplored.</i>

19:28.993 --> 19:31.735
<i>Those uninitiated
who have never been</i>

19:31.822 --> 19:33.694
<i>under the protection
of an alliance</i>

19:33.781 --> 19:36.610
<i>or pursued dreams
beyond their scope.</i>

19:36.697 --> 19:39.134
<i>Today, the crew
of the Protostar</i>

19:39.221 --> 19:41.092
<i>has been given a chance.</i>

19:41.180 --> 19:44.008
<i>A chance to discover
who they are...</i>

19:44.095 --> 19:46.794
You seem rather
adept with Murf.

19:46.881 --> 19:49.318
Have you ever considered
becoming a xenobiologist?

19:49.405 --> 19:52.713
Xenobiologist?
What's that?

19:52.800 --> 19:56.412
It's the study
of new life-forms.

19:56.499 --> 19:59.023
<i>A chance to prove
what they're capable of...</i>

19:59.110 --> 20:00.808
Aha!

20:07.815 --> 20:10.339
<i>A chance
to improve themselves...</i>

20:15.692 --> 20:18.434
It's perfect.

20:18.521 --> 20:22.264
<i>And finally, a chance
of finding their place</i>

20:22.351 --> 20:24.527
<i>in an endless universe.</i>

20:24.614 --> 20:27.487
Remember when you called me
a chump for ever thinking

20:27.574 --> 20:29.532
I would get off that rock?

20:29.619 --> 20:32.492
Now, look at us.

20:32.579 --> 20:36.539
To think, the two of us
would be in cat boots.

20:36.626 --> 20:40.630
You mean cahoots.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.980
How far away is Solum?

20:43.067 --> 20:45.766
I recognized these
particular star clusters

20:45.853 --> 20:50.118
from the ones visible
in the Solum holo-program.

20:50.205 --> 20:53.556
I know where
my home world is now.

20:53.643 --> 20:55.950
He's still out there,
isn't he?

20:56.037 --> 20:58.431
Your father.
- Crazy, huh?

20:58.518 --> 21:00.389
Time travel.

21:00.476 --> 21:03.479
I don't want you to leave.

21:03.566 --> 21:04.872
I know.

21:10.007 --> 21:12.271
Promise me,
we'll see each other again.

21:12.358 --> 21:14.403
We got this far, didn't we?

21:27.024 --> 21:29.026
There she goes!

21:37.905 --> 21:41.082
I hope you find
what you're looking for, Gwyn.

21:43.911 --> 21:45.608
Whoa.

21:45.695 --> 21:47.697
Guys. Guys, guys!
- Huh?

21:55.575 --> 21:56.967
Whoa!

21:57.054 --> 21:59.448
This is crazy.

22:03.713 --> 22:05.236
Brilliant!

22:05.324 --> 22:07.761
- Is that what I think it is?
- No way!

22:12.983 --> 22:16.073
Your previous ship
was a prototype,

22:16.160 --> 22:19.338
but Starfleet's now approved
a new Protostar class.

22:19.425 --> 22:21.470
Magnificent.

22:21.557 --> 22:23.994
So...

22:24.081 --> 22:26.040
are we, uh--

22:26.127 --> 22:29.043
is that our ship?

22:29.130 --> 22:33.743
Oh, I have
a much bigger plan for us.

22:37.399 --> 22:40.533
Well, are you coming or not?
