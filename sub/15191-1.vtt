WEBVTT

00:27.455 --> 00:29.749
And tell Robert we need
those press release edits

00:29.749 --> 00:31.334
for Deidre's approval
right now.

00:31.334 --> 00:33.920
We're on air in less than
15 minutes. Hang on.

00:33.920 --> 00:35.963
Did you switch out those chairs
like Deidre wanted?

00:35.963 --> 00:37.715
- Yeah, took care of it.
- Thanks a million.

00:37.715 --> 00:39.633
Get me those edits, Jess.

00:39.633 --> 00:42.510
- Good morning, Deidre.
- Good morning, Mandy.

00:42.510 --> 00:43.970
- Is she here?
- In makeup.

00:43.970 --> 00:45.847
- And the revised press release?
- On the way.

00:45.847 --> 00:48.058
Excellent. Did you put her
in the yellow suit I sent over?

00:48.058 --> 00:50.060
Yes, but she was
not happy about it.

00:50.060 --> 00:51.353
She writes children's books.

00:51.353 --> 00:53.021
She should be happy
about everything.

00:53.021 --> 00:55.190
Barbara Kirkland is best known

00:55.190 --> 00:57.776
for her series of bestselling
children's books,

00:57.776 --> 01:00.820
The Adventures of Stewart
the Singing Salamander.

01:00.820 --> 01:04.741
But now she's in the news
for something quite different.

01:04.741 --> 01:08.703
A video which has had more than
10 million online views

01:08.703 --> 01:10.205
in the last three days,

01:10.205 --> 01:13.041
features the author
berating her staff.

01:13.041 --> 01:14.542
BARBARA:  We're starting again,
 people!

01:14.542 --> 01:18.296
We are starting again
right now!

01:18.296 --> 01:22.550
HOST:  We'll have the legendary
 author Barbara Kirkland

01:22.550 --> 01:24.844
-  live in studio--
  - Okay.

01:24.844 --> 01:26.388
That is a perfect example

01:26.388 --> 01:29.432
of what you absolutely
cannot say in the interview.

01:29.432 --> 01:31.851
I'm aware of that, Deidre.

01:31.851 --> 01:34.396
You need to be gracious,
you need to be apologetic.

01:34.396 --> 01:37.232
You had a bad day.
Everyone has a bad day.

01:37.232 --> 01:39.776
- Isn't that right, Mandy?
- Absolutely.

01:39.776 --> 01:41.653
It's only human.

01:41.653 --> 01:44.363
Say this has been
a humbling experience,

01:44.363 --> 01:46.156
and you're grateful for it.

01:46.156 --> 01:48.867
Yes. People can relate to that.

01:48.867 --> 01:53.539
Honestly, this is just one
little video on the Internet.

01:53.539 --> 01:55.874
This is a bit
of an overreaction.

01:55.874 --> 01:59.586
That's what people do on
the Internet. They overreact.

01:59.586 --> 02:02.715
Barbara, I want you
to think about your readers.

02:02.715 --> 02:05.718
I want you to think about that
multimillion dollar industry

02:05.718 --> 02:08.470
that surrounds
that singing salamander.

02:08.470 --> 02:10.222
I'll be fine.

02:10.222 --> 02:11.932
I know how to handle the press.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.560
With all due respect, if you
knew how to handle the press,

02:14.560 --> 02:15.686
I wouldn't be here.

02:15.686 --> 02:18.939
So you'll do exactly as I say.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.983
Hmm?

02:20.983 --> 02:23.944
- So any regrets?
- [laughs]

02:23.944 --> 02:27.489
Make no mistake.
This has been quite horrifying.

02:27.489 --> 02:31.035
But seeing yourself
at your worst

02:31.035 --> 02:32.870
through someone else's eyes,

02:32.870 --> 02:34.455
it's instructive.

02:34.455 --> 02:37.666
This has been
a humbling experience.

02:37.666 --> 02:42.296
And for that,
I am truly grateful.

02:42.296 --> 02:45.132
We'll be back after the break.

02:51.304 --> 02:54.390
My friends, we have slayed
the dragon lady.

02:57.810 --> 03:00.438
- Great work on the interview.
- Thanks, Jess.

03:00.438 --> 03:03.483
Okay, so what was
Barbara Kirkland like in person?

03:03.483 --> 03:04.984
Was she terrifying?

03:04.984 --> 03:06.611
No when you work for Deidre.

03:06.611 --> 03:08.029
Good job on making her
look so human.

03:08.029 --> 03:09.739
I just follow the plan.

03:09.739 --> 03:12.241
But you're like the magician's
assistant, you know?

03:12.241 --> 03:13.826
Deirdre's the flash and dazzle,

03:13.826 --> 03:16.287
but you're the one who knows
how all the tricks work.

03:16.287 --> 03:20.249
I've got to,
or Deidre will saw me in half.

03:21.876 --> 03:24.837
- Stop. Mandy Cooper, stop.
- What's wrong?

03:24.837 --> 03:27.507
Are those the Ferragamo pumps
from your Pinterest board?

03:27.507 --> 03:30.176
Gotta dress for the job you
want, not the job you have.

03:30.176 --> 03:32.512
I promised myself
if today went well,

03:32.512 --> 03:35.473
I'd ask Deidre for
a little more responsibility.

03:35.473 --> 03:37.600
And if you don't ask,
you don't get.

03:37.600 --> 03:39.102
Exactly.

03:47.193 --> 03:48.569
Deidre, a moment?

03:48.569 --> 03:50.154
I'm listening.

03:50.154 --> 03:52.156
I, um...

03:52.156 --> 03:54.282
I thought today
went really well.

03:54.282 --> 03:56.076
Thank you.

03:56.076 --> 03:59.496
And I work very hard to
contribute to the work we do.

03:59.496 --> 04:02.541
And you feel like
that's not being acknowledged?

04:02.541 --> 04:06.628
No, it absolutely is.

04:06.628 --> 04:11.216
The thing is I want to do more
for our clients.

04:11.216 --> 04:13.009
For the firm, for you.

04:14.177 --> 04:16.262
- Meaning what?
- Well, uh...

04:16.262 --> 04:20.058
I have a B.A. in marketing
and public relations,

04:20.058 --> 04:22.477
and as gratifying as it is
being your assistant--

04:22.477 --> 04:25.272
You feel ready
for a new challenge.

04:25.272 --> 04:26.440
Yes!

04:26.440 --> 04:28.608
Yes, that's it exactly.

04:28.608 --> 04:29.734
Mm-hmm.

04:29.734 --> 04:31.653
Mandy, where do you keep
your ketchup?

04:31.653 --> 04:32.904
Beg your pardon?

04:34.239 --> 04:35.532
The condiment.

04:35.532 --> 04:37.492
Ketchup.
Are you familiar?

04:37.492 --> 04:41.455
Uh, yes, yeah, uh-huh.
Yeah, I know...

04:41.455 --> 04:43.206
I know what ketchup is.

04:43.206 --> 04:45.542
Good. Where do you keep it?

04:45.542 --> 04:47.919
Um, in the fridge?

04:47.919 --> 04:49.254
And why is that?

04:49.254 --> 04:51.465
I think it says to
on the bottle.

04:51.465 --> 04:53.550
Are you sure about that?

04:53.550 --> 04:55.427
Suddenly, I'm not.

04:55.427 --> 04:56.928
If you go into a diner,

04:56.928 --> 04:59.054
the ketchup is just
sitting there on the table.

04:59.054 --> 05:00.723
They don't serve it chilled.

05:00.723 --> 05:03.601
Hmm. Oh, I never
thought of that.

05:03.601 --> 05:05.603
No, you wouldn't.

05:05.603 --> 05:09.607
Mandy, you are very good
at doing what you're told.

05:09.607 --> 05:12.943
But a good PR person
digs deeper than that.

05:12.943 --> 05:16.489
They wanna know why things
are done in a certain way.

05:16.489 --> 05:21.035
My junior executives
excel in formulating

05:21.035 --> 05:24.121
and executing plans of action.

05:24.121 --> 05:26.957
But that's not you, Mandy.

05:26.957 --> 05:29.293
Is it? Do you know why?

05:29.293 --> 05:32.463
Because I keep my ketchup
in the refrigerator?

05:32.463 --> 05:35.633
No. That's where I keep mine.

05:35.633 --> 05:38.177
But I put it there
because I prefer it.

05:38.177 --> 05:41.680
You put it there
because somebody told you to.

05:48.729 --> 05:50.481
MANDY: So apparently
that's it, Mom.

05:50.481 --> 05:52.816
I'm gonna be an assistant
for the rest of my life

05:52.816 --> 05:54.151
because I don't
properly question

05:54.151 --> 05:56.820
the storage
of my hamburger toppings.

05:56.820 --> 05:58.656
That's the silliest thing
I've ever heard.

05:58.656 --> 06:01.116
I'm looking at the back
of the bottle right now,

06:01.116 --> 06:04.994
and it says, "For best results,
refrigerate after opening."

06:04.994 --> 06:07.163
Not really the point
of my story.

06:07.163 --> 06:08.665
I know, sweetie.

06:08.665 --> 06:11.209
The point is I work harder than
anyone else at that firm,

06:11.209 --> 06:13.169
hoping I'll get a chance
to move up.

06:13.169 --> 06:16.673
But Deidre thinks all I can do
is fetch coffee.

06:16.673 --> 06:20.343
And that is exactly why
you need this vacation.

06:20.343 --> 06:24.013
Tomorrow this time, we're gonna
be sipping frozen fruity drinks

06:24.013 --> 06:25.265
on the beach.

06:25.265 --> 06:26.849
It has been ages
since I've had

06:26.849 --> 06:29.686
both my girls
in the same place.

06:29.686 --> 06:32.647
You have got to see
your sister.

06:32.647 --> 06:34.857
You got the baby shower
invitation?

06:34.857 --> 06:37.569
I did, and I wanna be there,

06:37.569 --> 06:41.030
but it was hard enough getting
time off for our beach trip.

06:41.030 --> 06:43.199
Mandy, we just miss you.

06:43.199 --> 06:44.784
I miss you too.

06:44.784 --> 06:48.538
And I'll see you tomorrow
for sunshine and fruity drinks.

06:48.538 --> 06:49.581
Love you.

06:49.581 --> 06:51.457
Love you.

06:53.084 --> 06:56.212
A rowdy night out in the resort
town of Greenbriar, Idaho,

06:56.212 --> 06:58.006
for Prince Colin of Edgemere,

06:58.006 --> 07:00.550
who took a break from
his official visit to the U.S.

07:00.550 --> 07:03.678
to live up to his
bad boy reputation.

07:06.681 --> 07:10.392
[bell tolling]

07:12.311 --> 07:13.895
Prince Colin has been charged

07:13.895 --> 07:16.023
with defacing
a public landmark.

07:16.023 --> 07:17.608
He's currently in the custody

07:17.608 --> 07:19.526
of the Greenbriar
Sheriff's Department.

07:19.526 --> 07:22.070
It is the latest scandal
involving His Royal Highness,

07:22.070 --> 07:24.740
adding fuel to growing concerns
as to whether Prince Colin

07:24.740 --> 07:27.159
is fit to be king.

07:28.410 --> 07:30.370
Is Her Majesty aware?

07:30.370 --> 07:32.789
QUEEN: Penelope, a word!

07:32.789 --> 07:34.124
Ah.

07:34.124 --> 07:35.667
There it is.

07:38.712 --> 07:40.255
May I be of service, ma'am?

07:40.255 --> 07:42.591
Please alert the kitchen instead
of tea and cake this afternoon,

07:42.591 --> 07:45.594
we'll be having one of those
blended concoctions

07:45.594 --> 07:47.596
with wheat grass and--

07:47.596 --> 07:48.930
Oh, what is is called?

07:48.930 --> 07:50.390
Kale, I believe.

07:50.390 --> 07:53.185
Your Majesty
is requesting a smoothie.

07:53.185 --> 07:55.687
I must consider my health,
Penelope,

07:55.687 --> 07:58.106
because clearly I can never die.

07:58.106 --> 07:59.107
Your Majesty?

07:59.107 --> 08:01.026
I sent my son to America

08:01.026 --> 08:04.738
to dedicate a university library
in memory of his late father.

08:04.738 --> 08:06.114
A shockingly simple task.

08:06.114 --> 08:09.034
All he had to do was
wave and cut a ribbon.

08:09.034 --> 08:11.703
Somehow this leads to
the crown prince of Edgemere

08:11.703 --> 08:15.247
being arrested for taking a bath
in a public fountain.

08:15.247 --> 08:16.791
I can assure you, ma'am,

08:16.791 --> 08:19.043
he remained clothed
the whole time.

08:19.043 --> 08:20.586
Oh, marvelous.

08:20.586 --> 08:23.297
So he doesn't even understand
how bathing works.

08:23.297 --> 08:25.508
What was going through his mind?

08:25.508 --> 08:28.636
Has he gone mad?
Has he taken up drinking?

08:28.636 --> 08:31.097
Oh, no, no, no,
nothing of the sort.

08:31.097 --> 08:34.100
He was just...
overly rambunctious.

08:34.100 --> 08:37.144
And what of Lady Isabella?
Does she know about this?

08:37.144 --> 08:38.854
I'm certain she does.

08:38.854 --> 08:40.356
Begging your pardon, ma'am,

08:40.356 --> 08:42.982
I doubt she's any more
surprised than we are.

08:42.982 --> 08:44.819
Such an embarrassment.

08:44.819 --> 08:46.696
Colin is not demonstrating

08:46.696 --> 08:49.448
the behavior of a man
ready for marriage.

08:49.448 --> 08:51.784
My jubilee is in ten days,
Penelope,

08:51.784 --> 08:53.953
celebrating
25 years of my reign,

08:53.953 --> 08:58.082
a quarter century of leadership,
of sacrifice.

08:58.082 --> 09:00.459
The eyes of the world
will be upon us.

09:00.459 --> 09:02.461
I will not have
this distraction.

09:02.461 --> 09:04.296
What is Your Majesty's will?

09:04.296 --> 09:08.050
I'm afraid we require
outside assistance.

09:08.050 --> 09:11.303
Prince Colin of Edgemere,

09:11.303 --> 09:14.306
heir to the throne,
darling of the tabloids,

09:14.306 --> 09:20.061
defacer of fountains,
and our new client.

09:20.061 --> 09:22.897
The prince is in
Greenbriar, Idaho,

09:22.897 --> 09:24.524
one of those
charming little towns

09:24.524 --> 09:26.985
that looks like something
in a Thomas Kincaid painting.

09:26.985 --> 09:30.321
The director
of royal communications

09:30.321 --> 09:32.240
is on her way to Idaho,

09:32.240 --> 09:35.118
and the prince will be
released into her custody,

09:35.118 --> 09:38.538
but we still have
a court date to deal with.

09:38.538 --> 09:41.374
So our strategy:

09:41.374 --> 09:43.793
We get the sheriff
to drop all the charges,

09:43.793 --> 09:46.755
issue an apology
and a few good photo ops.

09:46.755 --> 09:48.214
Hmm? Robert...

09:48.214 --> 09:50.759
I'd like to prepare
a list of local charities

09:50.759 --> 09:52.510
that would love
a generous donation

09:52.510 --> 09:54.345
- from the royal family.
- You got it.

09:54.345 --> 09:56.806
Jamal, I need intel
on that sheriff.

09:56.806 --> 09:59.142
I wanna know
who I'm up against.

09:59.142 --> 10:03.062
Mandy, I want flights
to Idaho tonight

10:03.062 --> 10:05.774
and rooms at the little inn
in Greenbriar

10:05.774 --> 10:08.109
- for both of us.
- Us?

10:08.109 --> 10:11.780
I... Actually, I'm...
I'm flying out tonight

10:11.780 --> 10:14.449
to meet my mother and sister
at the beach.

10:14.449 --> 10:18.036
You know, Fourth of July
weekend. Vacation.

10:18.036 --> 10:20.246
This is the first time
I'm hearing of this.

10:20.246 --> 10:25.959
Actually, I think I mentioned it
when you, um, approved it.

10:25.959 --> 10:28.712
My sister and her husband
are expecting,

10:28.712 --> 10:31.465
so we thought a girls' trip
would be just--

10:31.465 --> 10:34.092
I'm sorry. Did I say something
that would lead you to believe

10:34.092 --> 10:36.220
that I was interested
in those details?

10:36.220 --> 10:37.262
I apologize.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.306
Oh, no, I apologize.

10:39.306 --> 10:41.892
I thought working directly

10:41.892 --> 10:44.144
with one of our most
high-profiled clients

10:44.144 --> 10:45.854
for someone seeking
greater responsibility

10:45.854 --> 10:49.107
would be interesting,
but I understand.

10:49.107 --> 10:51.235
You wanna go to the beach.

10:51.235 --> 10:52.444
How fun.

11:06.750 --> 11:09.503
[scoffs]
That child cried

11:09.503 --> 11:11.463
right next to me
the entire flight.

11:11.463 --> 11:12.923
That's terrible.

11:12.923 --> 11:16.802
I don't even know why they allow
children in first class.

11:16.802 --> 11:19.555
In the future, you have to find
out who's sitting next to me.

11:19.555 --> 11:21.932
I'm not sure how you do that.

11:21.932 --> 11:24.101
Oh, you'll find a way.

11:24.101 --> 11:27.980
I couldn't relax with that
incessant wailing in my ear.

11:27.980 --> 11:29.480
[scoffs]

11:29.480 --> 11:32.567
And now we have more than
an hour drive to Greenbriar?

11:32.567 --> 11:34.819
Oh, when I don't get rest,

11:34.819 --> 11:36.779
I get dark circles
under my eyes.

11:36.779 --> 11:39.866
I'm gonna meet the prince
looking like Uncle Fester.

11:52.044 --> 11:54.589
This is the little hotel?

12:04.599 --> 12:07.101
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

12:07.101 --> 12:09.061
Deidre, are you
feeling all right?

12:09.061 --> 12:10.605
I'm just a little jetlagged.

12:10.605 --> 12:11.772
Here are your keys.

12:11.772 --> 12:13.649
Hand me my overnight bag.

12:15.776 --> 12:18.029
Okay, you take the suitcases.
I need everything pressed.

12:18.029 --> 12:20.281
Make sure they know
not too much starch.

12:20.281 --> 12:21.991
Do you wanna go over your notes
for the meeting?

12:21.991 --> 12:25.202
No, just come the room
in the morning. I'm exhausted.

12:25.202 --> 12:26.787
Okay.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.919
Yes, ma'am, I've just
checked into the hotel,

12:33.919 --> 12:37.005
and I'm on my way to retrieve
him from the constable.

12:37.005 --> 12:39.716
I'll have him in hand
within the hour.

12:39.716 --> 12:42.886
We're meeting with the PR person
first thing in the morning.

12:42.886 --> 12:45.555
Yes, Your Majesty,
I won't let him out of my sight

12:45.555 --> 12:47.307
for a second.

12:51.853 --> 12:53.647
[trolley bells ringing]

12:58.902 --> 13:00.028
[ding]

13:11.623 --> 13:13.041
Deidre!

13:13.041 --> 13:15.794
What is happening to me?

13:15.794 --> 13:17.587
It could be
some sort of allergy.

13:17.587 --> 13:19.589
[scoffs]
It's not an allergy.

13:19.589 --> 13:21.049
Allergies are for weak people,

13:21.049 --> 13:22.801
and I can adapt
to any environment.

13:22.801 --> 13:24.803
That's not really
how allergies work.

13:24.803 --> 13:27.013
Oh, I'm not in the mood
for semantics, Mandy.

13:27.013 --> 13:28.723
What does the Internet say?

13:28.723 --> 13:31.142
Well, it says
it could just be acne.

13:31.142 --> 13:34.270
[scoffs]
It most certainly could not.

13:34.270 --> 13:35.480
Okay, bed bugs.

13:35.480 --> 13:37.232
Bed bugs only live
in New York.

13:37.232 --> 13:40.109
Or it might-- Well, no.

13:40.109 --> 13:42.611
You had chicken pox when
you were a kid, didn't you?

13:42.611 --> 13:43.779
Of course not.

13:43.779 --> 13:45.614
I mean, you know
how at some point

13:45.614 --> 13:47.783
it spread through
your kindergarten class

13:47.783 --> 13:49.410
like wildfire?

13:49.410 --> 13:51.912
Exactly what sort of school
did your parents send you to?

13:51.912 --> 13:54.081
If you're around a bunch of
kids, it's bound to happen.

13:54.081 --> 13:58.293
Which is exactly why I have
avoided children my entire life,

13:58.293 --> 14:01.130
especially when I was a child.

14:01.130 --> 14:02.715
[gasps]

14:02.715 --> 14:06.927
It was that wailing toddler
on the plane.

14:06.927 --> 14:08.387
Oh, he did this to me!

14:08.387 --> 14:10.431
Aw, that poor kid.
No wonder he was crying.

14:10.431 --> 14:11.807
It's not about him
right now, Mandy.

14:11.807 --> 14:13.600
[gasps]
Ohh!

14:13.600 --> 14:16.562
It's like the opening scene
of one of those  Outbreak  movies.

14:16.562 --> 14:19.189
Let's just get you
to a doctor.

14:19.189 --> 14:21.525
Okay, fine.
Get me my makeup bag.

14:21.525 --> 14:24.194
No, no, no, you cannot
put makeup on chicken pox.

14:24.194 --> 14:26.238
It can lead to scarring.

14:26.238 --> 14:28.115
Well, I cannot go out
looking like this.

14:28.115 --> 14:30.200
My face looks like
strawberry parfait.

14:30.200 --> 14:31.952
Well, I'll have a doctor
come to you,

14:31.952 --> 14:34.580
and I'll get calamine lotion
and something for the fever.

14:34.580 --> 14:36.957
Really, the best thing
you can do is get back in bed.

14:36.957 --> 14:40.502
If it is chicken pox,
it is highly contagious.

14:40.502 --> 14:42.796
Okay, fine.

14:42.796 --> 14:45.173
This isn't a crisis.

14:45.173 --> 14:48.092
I can handle it all
from here.

14:48.092 --> 14:51.095
You'll just have to go
to the meeting in my place.

14:51.095 --> 14:54.098
Oh! Okay.

14:54.098 --> 14:57.351
Well, you were looking for
greater responsibility, Mandy.

14:57.351 --> 14:59.520
Here's your chance.

15:01.773 --> 15:02.815
[sighs]

15:05.359 --> 15:07.820
Ah, Ms. Kelley,
good morning!

15:07.820 --> 15:09.405
Glad I caught you.
I have your suits.

15:09.405 --> 15:11.532
- Oh.
- They're freshly pressed,

15:11.532 --> 15:13.451
just as you requested.

15:13.451 --> 15:14.869
Right.

15:14.869 --> 15:17.455
You have a great day now.

15:17.455 --> 15:19.123
Uh...

15:24.629 --> 15:27.256
Gotta dress
for the job you want.

15:34.222 --> 15:35.264
What the devil?

15:35.264 --> 15:36.349
Good morning, sir!

15:36.349 --> 15:38.184
It's a brand-new day.

15:38.184 --> 15:41.938
Wicked woman! I need sleep!
I've been through an ordeal!

15:41.938 --> 15:44.732
Don't you think
we're getting a little old

15:44.732 --> 15:46.943
for these shenanigans?

15:46.943 --> 15:48.652
Oh, come now, Penelope.

15:48.652 --> 15:50.445
Shenanigans make life
worth living.

15:50.445 --> 15:52.697
Don't be clever.
I'm immune to your charms.

15:52.697 --> 15:53.990
Now get up!

15:53.990 --> 15:55.617
Somebody's in a mood
this morning.

15:55.617 --> 15:57.577
If I appear to be in a mood,

15:57.577 --> 16:00.997
it's because I have neither
the time nor the inclination

16:00.997 --> 16:04.835
to scurry about cleaning up
another one of your messes.

16:04.835 --> 16:07.129
And yet here we are.

16:07.129 --> 16:11.299
The situation is so dire,

16:11.299 --> 16:16.555
we have actually had to enlist
the aid of an American.

16:16.555 --> 16:18.932
That must be very difficult
for you.

16:18.932 --> 16:23.270
I will suffer the indignity
you have laid at my feet,

16:23.270 --> 16:24.938
and we will repair the damage.

16:24.938 --> 16:27.691
You're the best. I'll just
grab a bit more shuteye

16:27.691 --> 16:29.192
and let you
take care of things.

16:29.192 --> 16:32.487
Your Royal Highness,
kindly dress yourself

16:32.487 --> 16:34.781
and join me
in the drawing room,

16:34.781 --> 16:39.244
otherwise I will return
with a bucket of ice water.

16:49.796 --> 16:52.716
[inhales, exhales]

17:01.849 --> 17:03.559
You can do this.

17:11.233 --> 17:13.484
Good morning.
I'm Penelope Sheridan.

17:13.484 --> 17:16.530
You must be Miss Kelley.

17:16.530 --> 17:19.157
You are Miss Kelley,
aren't you?

17:21.327 --> 17:22.493
Am I?

17:24.038 --> 17:25.580
Yes.

17:25.580 --> 17:26.624
Yes, I am.

17:26.624 --> 17:28.541
Do come in.

17:30.711 --> 17:34.715
Miss Kelley, may I offer you
a cup of tea?

17:34.715 --> 17:36.967
Yes, please, thank you.

17:36.967 --> 17:40.012
I'm sure you keep
quite an active calendar.

17:40.012 --> 17:42.514
The queen would like me
to convey her appreciation

17:42.514 --> 17:44.475
for making yourself available.

17:44.475 --> 17:47.353
This is precisely what I
make myself available for.

17:47.353 --> 17:49.688
Please, do sit.

17:49.688 --> 17:52.358
So you met with
the sheriff last night.

17:52.358 --> 17:54.401
When I retrieved
His Highness, yes.

17:54.401 --> 17:55.694
I must warn you,

17:55.694 --> 17:58.363
he seems disinclined
to drop the charges.

17:58.363 --> 18:02.325
You let me worry about that.
Where is the prince now?

18:02.325 --> 18:05.703
The prince is still waking up.

18:05.703 --> 18:09.540
Your Royal Highness, may I
present Miss Deidre Kelley.

18:09.540 --> 18:13.586
Miss Kelley,
it's a pleasure meeting you.

18:13.586 --> 18:16.965
I'm very sorry to have made you
travel all this way for nothing,

18:16.965 --> 18:18.883
but we do not require
your services.

18:18.883 --> 18:20.718
Sir, as we discussed--

18:20.718 --> 18:23.012
My mother seems to think
I need to bundled and sold

18:23.012 --> 18:24.847
to the public
like a pack of sausages.

18:24.847 --> 18:27.016
I'm not really interested
in that sort of thing.

18:27.016 --> 18:28.434
Penelope can sort
everything out.

18:28.434 --> 18:29.560
She always does.

18:29.560 --> 18:31.521
Sir, this time I cannot.

18:32.814 --> 18:34.732
I splashed around
in a fountain

18:34.732 --> 18:38.236
and ran afoul of a sheriff with
far too much time on his hands.

18:38.236 --> 18:40.446
You're behaving as though
I burned down a building.

18:40.446 --> 18:44.742
You were arrested.
There are actual consequences.

18:44.742 --> 18:46.786
Think of the press.

18:46.786 --> 18:49.038
I've dealt with the press
my entire life.

18:49.038 --> 18:50.331
This will blow over.

18:50.331 --> 18:53.001
- Your Majesty--
- My mother is "Her Majesty."

18:53.001 --> 18:56.379
My proper address is
"Your Royal Highness,"

18:56.379 --> 18:58.172
followed thereafter as "Sir."

18:58.172 --> 19:01.426
- I'm sorry.
- You're quite young

19:01.426 --> 19:04.177
for a public relations
executive.

19:04.177 --> 19:07.306
I, uh... moisturize.

19:07.306 --> 19:11.768
Your Royal Highness, sir,
with all due respect,

19:11.768 --> 19:14.479
if you knew how to handle
the press, I wouldn't be here.

19:14.479 --> 19:16.940
So from now on,
you're gonna do

19:16.940 --> 19:19.735
exactly what I tell you to do.

19:23.280 --> 19:26.658
Oh, my. You certainly have
put me in my place.

19:26.658 --> 19:28.910
Now I can't help but comply,
can I?

19:28.910 --> 19:29.953
Really?

19:29.953 --> 19:32.497
No! Have you gone quietly mad?

19:32.497 --> 19:34.666
I'm going back to bed.

19:37.544 --> 19:39.796
Normally that's
much more effective.

19:39.796 --> 19:43.300
Actually, that went much better
than I anticipated.

19:43.300 --> 19:44.676
Milk?

19:49.097 --> 19:50.974
Ms. Kelley, I'm sorry,
but I can't let that boy off

19:50.974 --> 19:52.392
with just a slap on the wrist.

19:52.392 --> 19:53.977
But Sheriff Wrigley,

19:53.977 --> 19:56.188
we're talking about
the crown prince of Edgemere.

19:56.188 --> 19:58.857
You see, I don't even know
where that is.

19:58.857 --> 20:01.193
What I do know about
is that fountain.

20:01.193 --> 20:03.695
It was built in 1913
by the town's founder

20:03.695 --> 20:05.238
to honor his wife.

20:05.238 --> 20:06.740
And the Founder's Fountain
is listed

20:06.740 --> 20:09.158
on the National Historic
Registry of Fountains.

20:09.158 --> 20:11.660
And there's not a man, woman
or child in Greenbriar

20:11.660 --> 20:14.497
who hasn't made a wish
in that fountain.

20:14.497 --> 20:16.082
So you see, that fella
was literally

20:16.082 --> 20:17.666
stomping on people's wishes.

20:17.666 --> 20:19.210
And we want to make that right.

20:19.210 --> 20:22.838
Dropping the charges would set
a dangerous precedent.

20:22.838 --> 20:24.965
I'd be hauling tourists
and vagrants

20:24.965 --> 20:26.926
out of the water every night.

20:26.926 --> 20:29.261
That's a slippery slope.
The next thing you know,

20:29.261 --> 20:31.180
hooligans will be
taking over the town.

20:31.180 --> 20:32.848
Not on my watch.

20:32.848 --> 20:35.768
It sounds like Greenbriar
is a very special place.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.019
It is.

20:37.019 --> 20:40.314
Sheriff Wrigley,
consider just for a moment,

20:40.314 --> 20:41.816
if Prince Colin pays a fine,

20:41.816 --> 20:44.026
maybe spends a few nights
in jail,

20:44.026 --> 20:46.695
does that really help
your wonderful town?

20:46.695 --> 20:48.906
I think so.

20:48.906 --> 20:51.492
I'm not so sure.

20:51.492 --> 20:55.204
But if he did some sort
of community service,

20:55.204 --> 20:56.789
think of the press coverage.

20:56.789 --> 21:00.126
People would have the chance
to get to know Greenbriar

21:00.126 --> 21:03.129
as the unique gem
it so clearly is.

21:03.129 --> 21:06.757
Now wouldn't that
be something?

21:06.757 --> 21:09.844
MANDY: Jess, I can't believe
it's working, but it is.

21:09.844 --> 21:11.470
I got the sheriff
to compromise

21:11.470 --> 21:14.722
without resorting
to Deidre's usual techniques

21:14.722 --> 21:17.183
of intimidation and humiliation.

21:17.183 --> 21:19.602
I'm proving I can
execute a plan.

21:19.602 --> 21:21.729
But why did you say
you were her?

21:21.729 --> 21:24.357
I don't know.
She asked, and I just said yes.

21:24.357 --> 21:26.067
I couldn't stop myself.

21:26.067 --> 21:29.446
Mandy, you've gotta fix this
before it goes any further.

21:29.446 --> 21:31.156
If you make a choice
you can't take back,

21:31.156 --> 21:33.074
you're gonna be forced
to live with the consequences.

21:33.074 --> 21:35.994
Look, I'm not proud of it,
but there's no going back.

21:35.994 --> 21:37.579
What am I supposed to do,

21:37.579 --> 21:39.789
tell them that
I forgot my own name?

21:39.789 --> 21:43.084
If I can get Prince Colin to go
along with the sheriff's offer,

21:43.084 --> 21:44.919
I'll be a hero.

21:44.919 --> 21:46.671
True.

21:46.671 --> 21:49.591
You think you can get the
prince to agree to your plan?

21:49.591 --> 21:51.217
Absolutely not!

21:51.217 --> 21:53.553
This is what we're paying
Deidre Kelley to do,

21:53.553 --> 21:56.181
make arrangements for me to
collect rubbish on the roadside?

21:56.181 --> 22:00.226
The public is craving
an act of contrition from you.

22:00.226 --> 22:03.021
What about my dignity?

22:03.021 --> 22:05.899
Your dignity?
Is that an attempt at humor?

22:05.899 --> 22:09.402
Your Highness, may I remind you
we are in this predicament

22:09.402 --> 22:12.780
because you decided to take
a romp in a decorative fountain.

22:12.780 --> 22:15.533
I was... celebrating.

22:15.533 --> 22:16.784
Celebrating what, exactly?

22:16.784 --> 22:18.452
A moment of freedom,

22:18.452 --> 22:21.955
not having every second of
my life dictated by Her Majesty.

22:21.955 --> 22:24.666
Can you imagine Lady Isabella's
feelings in all this?

22:24.666 --> 22:28.337
All I can do is imagine
Lady Isabella's feelings.

22:28.337 --> 22:29.796
She certainly isn't
gonna show them.

22:29.796 --> 22:33.050
Lady Isabella is
a dignified young lady

22:33.050 --> 22:34.635
who understands protocol.

22:34.635 --> 22:37.471
You could learn
a great deal from her.

22:37.471 --> 22:41.725
It's the Royal Jubilee
in eight days.

22:41.725 --> 22:44.353
You have become a liability.

22:44.353 --> 22:46.480
Your image has to be
rehabilitated

22:46.480 --> 22:49.650
before we announce
your engagement to Lady Isabella

22:49.650 --> 22:50.817
at the ball.

22:50.817 --> 22:51.777
Of course.

22:51.777 --> 22:53.987
We must make me fit for a wife.

22:53.987 --> 22:56.156
No, Your Highness.

22:56.156 --> 22:59.243
We must make you fit
for a queen.

23:01.203 --> 23:04.081
There. I think I got
every spot.

23:04.081 --> 23:05.958
I look horrible, don't I?

23:05.958 --> 23:07.501
You look...

23:07.501 --> 23:10.212
like you need some rest
and to get better.

23:10.212 --> 23:13.674
The doctor says I'm gonna be
contagious for up to five days.

23:13.674 --> 23:16.510
This is a nightmare.
I feel like Typhoid Mary,

23:16.510 --> 23:18.428
and the itching
is driving me insane.

23:18.428 --> 23:20.180
Did you pick up
that oatmeal bath?

23:20.180 --> 23:21.974
On it.

23:21.974 --> 23:24.225
At least things with
Prince Colin are looking up.

23:24.225 --> 23:27.603
The community service angle
was a stroke of genius.

23:27.603 --> 23:30.231
Yeah, well, I'm just glad
the sheriff--

23:30.231 --> 23:32.984
It will showcase the community,
humanize the prince,

23:32.984 --> 23:34.569
and the optics will be fabulous.

23:34.569 --> 23:37.363
That's why it was
my only prudent option.

23:37.363 --> 23:40.074
You followed my plans
very well, Mandy.

23:42.410 --> 23:45.746
Thanks.
I'll run your bath.

Ohh!

24:20.740 --> 24:23.492
Deidre, I am so sorry.

24:25.036 --> 24:27.121
I don't understand
how this happened.

24:27.121 --> 24:30.498
I slipped! It was an accident.
It really was.

24:30.498 --> 24:33.543
Of course it was an accident.
Why would you do it on purpose?

24:33.543 --> 24:35.670
Right, why would I do that?

24:35.670 --> 24:38.506
Just pick me up
a replacement tomorrow

24:38.506 --> 24:40.175
and call Penelope
on your phone.

24:40.175 --> 24:44.012
Oh, I must have left
her number in my room.

24:44.012 --> 24:45.764

- Tell you what.

24:45.764 --> 24:47.265
Why don't you have a nice soak
in that oatmeal,

on the landline

Miss Kelley, good evening.

Her Majesty's
director of communications.

25:18.797 --> 25:21.341
Shall we get down to business?

25:37.898 --> 25:39.483
Good morning, Penelope.

25:39.483 --> 25:42.236
Shall we prepare
for the press conference?

25:42.236 --> 25:45.072
- We have a slight problem.
- What?

- No.

26:09.930 --> 26:11.140

- Sorry.

Excuse me.
I'm looking for a prince.

27:38.810 --> 27:42.437
I'm not pretending.
Think of me as a friend.

27:55.951 --> 27:57.619
No, Miss Kelley, it is not.

27:57.619 --> 27:59.037
It is yet another reminder

27:59.037 --> 28:00.914
that I am a bottomless pit
of disappointment

And you didn't learn to play

28:22.978 --> 28:26.982
No. It required discipline
and practice.

28:31.319 --> 28:34.322
Ah, but you see,
your example is flawed

28:34.322 --> 28:38.451
because I hated learning piano.

28:38.451 --> 28:40.036
I took lessons for eleven years.

28:40.036 --> 28:44.833
Mother and Father insisted that
I learn Tchaikovsky, Chopin,

31:01.049 --> 31:03.010

31:03.010 --> 31:06.221
Unfortunately, I challenged
that hospitality two nights ago

31:06.221 --> 31:08.140
by being a very bad guest.

31:08.140 --> 31:10.392
I wish to be very clear.

31:10.392 --> 31:12.686
My lack of regard
for the Founder's Fountain

31:12.686 --> 31:16.481
and what it represents to this
community was uncalled for.

31:16.481 --> 31:17.899
Now, my countrymen
have questioned

31:17.899 --> 31:20.444
if this is the behavior
of a future king.

31:20.444 --> 31:22.779
I can say unequivocally
that it is not.

31:22.779 --> 31:27.951

that and resolve to do better.

will be on the money.

34:03.980 --> 34:07.275
what do you want to do
with your life?

34:08.985 --> 34:10.652
I don't know,

34:10.652 --> 34:13.572
but I'd like the option
of finding out.

34:13.572 --> 34:16.824
I must say,
I was pleasantly surprised.

34:16.824 --> 34:20.078
Yes, he presented himself
quite well, didn't he?

34:20.078 --> 34:23.831
The true challenge, of course,
will be tomorrow's agenda.

34:23.831 --> 34:27.043
It appears Miss Kelley is quite
deserving of her reputation.

34:27.043 --> 34:28.253
Indeed.

34:28.253 --> 34:31.047
I never asked, Your Majesty,

34:31.047 --> 34:33.675
what made you
contact her firm?

34:33.675 --> 34:35.092
Highly recommended

34:35.092 --> 34:37.012
through the former
prime minister of Sri Lanka.

34:37.012 --> 34:38.931
Miss Kelley assisted him
with a crisis,

34:38.931 --> 34:41.016
perhaps fifteen years ago.

34:41.016 --> 34:43.768
Fifteen years. Really?

34:43.768 --> 34:48.023
So that would make her
40 or 45 years old.

34:48.023 --> 34:51.360
We're not in the habit of
speculating on a person's age,

34:51.360 --> 34:52.527
are we, Penelope?

34:52.527 --> 34:55.197
Of course not.
My apologies.

34:55.197 --> 34:57.324
Send my best wishes
to His Royal Highness.

34:57.324 --> 34:59.117
Until tomorrow then.

35:05.332 --> 35:07.584
- Your Majesty.
- Lady Isabella.

35:07.584 --> 35:09.378
Please sit.

35:09.378 --> 35:10.796
To what do I owe the pleasure?

35:10.796 --> 35:13.215
I came for the fitting
of my ball gown.

35:13.215 --> 35:15.550
I wanted to share my delight
at Prince Colin's appearance

35:15.550 --> 35:17.176
on television.

35:17.176 --> 35:19.595
Her Majesty must be so pleased.

35:19.595 --> 35:20.763
And you as well.

35:20.763 --> 35:22.098
Yes, ma'am.

35:22.098 --> 35:24.267
It was certainly a step
in the right direction.

35:24.267 --> 35:26.143
I am cautiously optimistic.

35:26.143 --> 35:30.064
Your patience and understanding
are most appreciated.

35:30.064 --> 35:33.567
We will make a suitable husband
of him yet, I assure you.

35:33.567 --> 35:35.820
I've waited a very long time
for him, ma'am.

35:35.820 --> 35:38.447
I certainly don't mind
a few more days.

35:39.782 --> 35:42.910
- So, until tomorrow then?
- Bright and early.

35:42.910 --> 35:45.997
I'll be ready to work
in my denims and wellies.

35:45.997 --> 35:48.040
I have no idea what those are,

35:48.040 --> 35:50.251
but I'll trust
Penelope's judgment.

35:50.251 --> 35:51.460
[phone chimes]

35:56.465 --> 35:58.884
I should take this.
It's work.

35:58.884 --> 36:01.095
Of course.
No rest for the weary.

36:01.095 --> 36:03.055
Until tomorrow then.

36:12.898 --> 36:14.275
What's wrong?

36:14.275 --> 36:15.943
Well, now you've gone
and done it.

36:15.943 --> 36:18.904
I have been woven into your
tapestry of lies and deception,

36:18.904 --> 36:22.574
and when it inevitably unravels,
I'm going down with you.

36:22.574 --> 36:24.034
What are you talking about?

36:24.034 --> 36:25.327
Deidre called the office.

36:25.327 --> 36:26.995
She wanted
Penelope's phone number.

36:26.995 --> 36:28.496
Oh, no. What'd you say?

36:28.496 --> 36:29.956
I told her those
European cell phones

36:29.956 --> 36:32.042
are notoriously unreliable
in the U.S.

36:32.042 --> 36:34.419
What? That's good!
You did good.

36:34.419 --> 36:36.463
- Did I?
  - Yes!

36:36.463 --> 36:38.506
I'm not an experienced liar
like you.

36:38.506 --> 36:40.258
I'm not an experienced liar.

36:40.258 --> 36:43.595
You will be soon because you're
getting plenty of practice.

36:43.595 --> 36:45.930
We only have to keep this up
for a few more days.

36:45.930 --> 36:48.767
After Prince Colin
completes his community service,

36:48.767 --> 36:51.019
I'll confess everything
to Deidre.

36:51.019 --> 36:53.605
She'll be so happy with
how everything turned out,

36:53.605 --> 36:55.648
it'll be like
no big deal at all.

36:55.648 --> 36:57.192
You really believe that?

36:57.192 --> 37:00.695
I have to. I'm in too deep
to turn back now.

37:31.850 --> 37:33.102
What?

37:33.102 --> 37:35.687
I took my eyes off him
for a second.

37:35.687 --> 37:37.022
You lost him again?

37:37.022 --> 37:38.941
Penelope, you knew
he was a flight risk!

37:38.941 --> 37:41.360
There is something else
we need to discuss.

37:41.360 --> 37:44.196
Yes, yes, of course,
right after I find Colin.

37:44.196 --> 37:47.783
So it's "Colin" now, is it?

37:47.783 --> 37:49.159
Hmm.

38:02.506 --> 38:05.092
You're doing this
just to drive me crazy.

38:05.092 --> 38:07.845
Well, good morning, Deidre.
Don't you look lovely.

38:07.845 --> 38:10.556
Oh, well, thank you.

38:10.556 --> 38:11.849
You look, um...

38:11.849 --> 38:14.226
I mean it is time to go.

38:14.226 --> 38:15.644
- Uh-huh.
- We need--

38:15.644 --> 38:17.187
Excuse me!

38:25.654 --> 38:27.948
If you don't show up
to your community service,

38:27.948 --> 38:30.242
Sheriff Wrigley
will put you back in jail.

38:30.242 --> 38:31.660
So come on, let's go.

38:34.787 --> 38:36.497
Wait!

38:40.334 --> 38:42.378
Colin, I am begging you,

38:42.378 --> 38:45.590
begging you to please
take this seriously.

38:45.590 --> 38:47.425
I am. I promise.

38:47.425 --> 38:50.678
I intend to be
a dutiful public servant.

38:50.678 --> 38:51.929
Thank you.

38:51.929 --> 38:53.806
Right after a few more laps.

38:53.806 --> 38:54.849
Colin!

38:56.267 --> 38:57.602
[frustrated yell]

39:04.692 --> 39:07.528
Prince Colin reported
for his community service

39:07.528 --> 39:09.363
in Greenbriar, Idaho, today

39:09.363 --> 39:11.824
and quickly became
the toast of the town.

39:20.041 --> 39:23.294
And in addition to the excellent
pediatric care,

39:23.294 --> 39:25.963
we offer a play area.

39:31.469 --> 39:32.553
Aha!

39:34.305 --> 39:37.307
No! A sneak attack!
I need reinforcements!

39:37.307 --> 39:38.725
Miss Kelley!
Miss Kelley, help, help!

39:38.725 --> 39:40.644
I'll save you, Your Highness!

39:40.644 --> 39:41.811
Hah!

39:52.697 --> 39:55.116
Better known for his
hard-partying ways

39:55.116 --> 39:56.660
than his good deeds,

39:56.660 --> 39:58.328
it appears the bad boy royal

39:58.328 --> 40:01.039
might be turning over
a new leaf.

40:01.039 --> 40:03.625
That is my dress!

40:03.625 --> 40:05.836
Thank you so much
for having us.

40:05.836 --> 40:08.797
I hope we didn't cause
too much of a distraction.

40:10.382 --> 40:12.592
You have a beautiful
facility here.

40:12.592 --> 40:15.011
Thank you, I appreciate it.

40:15.011 --> 40:17.055
And how's your puzzle
coming along?

40:17.055 --> 40:19.808
It's gonna be
a picture of horses.

40:23.353 --> 40:24.854
Mind if I help?

40:29.526 --> 40:32.362
You know, I had a favorite horse
when I was your age.

40:32.362 --> 40:34.030
You had your own horse?

40:34.030 --> 40:37.367
Oh, we had lots of them.

40:37.367 --> 40:40.704
- What's your name?
- Keisha.

40:40.704 --> 40:43.706
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Keisha. I'm Prince Colin.

40:43.706 --> 40:45.040
You're not a prince.

40:45.040 --> 40:46.375
Yes, he is, baby.

40:46.375 --> 40:48.419
It's an honor to meet you, sir.

40:49.878 --> 40:54.592
Would you all mind giving us
a few minutes, please?

40:56.760 --> 40:58.929
If you're a prince,
then where's your crown?

40:58.929 --> 41:01.515
Well, I knew my crown
could never compete

41:01.515 --> 41:02.891
with your extraordinary hat.

41:02.891 --> 41:04.893
My mom made it.

41:04.893 --> 41:07.896
She must love you very much,
making you such a fine hat.

41:07.896 --> 41:10.399
Are you a princess?

41:10.399 --> 41:13.777
Me? Oh, gosh, no, I'm not.

41:13.777 --> 41:15.696
I didn't think so.

41:15.696 --> 41:18.407
- [Colin laughs]
- Keisha!

41:18.407 --> 41:21.285
This is my very good friend
Miss Kelley.

41:21.285 --> 41:23.829
I do not currently have
a princess, but I will someday.

41:23.829 --> 41:25.706
What kind of a princess
would you want?

41:27.207 --> 41:28.584
You know something?

41:28.584 --> 41:30.544
You're the first person
to ever ask me that.

41:30.544 --> 41:32.046
I ask good questions.

41:32.046 --> 41:34.840
You certainly do.

41:34.840 --> 41:37.134
Let me see.
I would want a princess

41:37.134 --> 41:39.637
who... is kind,

41:39.637 --> 41:41.764
with a good heart.

41:41.764 --> 41:44.767
Someone very clever and smart,

41:44.767 --> 41:47.769
someone who laughs
and tells stories,

41:47.769 --> 41:50.813
someone who tries to make life
easier for others.

41:50.813 --> 41:53.149
And she has to be
beautiful too.

41:53.149 --> 41:55.860
Keisha, anyone who matches
that description

41:55.860 --> 41:57.779
is already quite beautiful.

42:04.661 --> 42:07.080
COLIN: I want to thank you
for today, Deidre.

42:07.080 --> 42:08.498
It was quite delightful.

42:08.498 --> 42:10.416
Just doing my job.

42:10.416 --> 42:13.503
Yes, there's that,
but I mean for me personally.

42:13.503 --> 42:16.506
It's one of the best days
I've had in quite some time.

42:16.506 --> 42:19.509
Thank you, Colin.
I had fun too.

42:19.509 --> 42:21.636
I don't get to say that
very often.

42:21.636 --> 42:22.970
[phone rings]

42:22.970 --> 42:26.057
Oh. Mom, of course.

42:26.057 --> 42:27.725
Stop ignoring your mother.

42:28.851 --> 42:30.812
So what's on tomorrow's agenda?

42:30.812 --> 42:33.064
The Fourth of July festival
in the town square.

42:33.064 --> 42:36.526
Just a series of photo ops,
nothing too strenuous.

42:36.526 --> 42:38.027
How exciting.

42:38.027 --> 42:40.238
I've never been in America
for Independence Day.

42:40.238 --> 42:41.656
Until tomorrow then.

42:41.656 --> 42:44.200
And if you need anything
before then, you have my number.

42:56.712 --> 42:58.296
[knocking]

43:05.804 --> 43:07.389
Penelope! Hi!

43:07.389 --> 43:10.058
I hope I'm not disturbing you.
May I come in?

43:10.058 --> 43:11.977
Of course, please.

43:11.977 --> 43:14.104
Um, I'm sorry
if I seem surprised.

43:14.104 --> 43:16.064
I just don't remember
telling you what room I was in.

43:16.064 --> 43:20.402
You didn't. I can uncover
any information I need.

43:20.402 --> 43:22.237
That's my job.

43:22.237 --> 43:25.490
And what about you?
What's your job?

43:25.490 --> 43:28.952
Because it appears you're
currently doing someone else's.

43:31.204 --> 43:35.250
I have served the royal family
in varying capacities

43:35.250 --> 43:36.626
my entire life.

43:36.626 --> 43:39.838
There is no scheme,
trickery or intrigue

43:39.838 --> 43:42.799
that I have not
previously encountered.

43:42.799 --> 43:47.846
However, if it gets
the desired effect,

43:47.846 --> 43:49.723
you'll get no argument from me.

43:49.723 --> 43:53.518
If I'm not informed,
I cannot be of assistance.

43:53.518 --> 43:57.605
So, dear,
who the devil are you

43:57.605 --> 44:00.357
and what has happened
to the real Deidre Kelley?

44:00.357 --> 44:03.611
I don't know
how to explain this.

44:03.611 --> 44:05.321
Try.

44:05.321 --> 44:08.407
Um...

44:08.407 --> 44:11.076
where do you keep
your ketchup?

44:17.333 --> 44:21.128
Your impersonation of me
is aggressively bad.

44:21.128 --> 44:22.588
I'm not good with accents.

44:22.588 --> 44:25.424
That much is obvious.

44:25.424 --> 44:27.676
Well, Miss Cooper,

44:27.676 --> 44:30.930
there are so many flaws
in your little scheme

44:30.930 --> 44:33.015
that I truly don't know
where to begin.

44:35.768 --> 44:39.647
I kept thinking it would be so
much easier if I were Deidre.

44:39.647 --> 44:42.775
Everyone listens to her
and trusts her ideas,

44:42.775 --> 44:46.821
so when you asked if I was her,
I just... I said yes.

44:46.821 --> 44:49.448
I know I shouldn't
have said it,

44:49.448 --> 44:52.409
but I did,
and now I'm dealing with that.

44:52.409 --> 44:54.537
I can say
with absolute certainty

44:54.537 --> 44:56.330
that you will get caught,

44:56.330 --> 44:58.374
and the fallout
will be horrendous.

44:58.374 --> 44:59.792
It's just for a few more days,

44:59.792 --> 45:03.211
and then I promise
I will confess everything.

45:03.211 --> 45:06.089
Penelope, please,
will you help me?

45:06.089 --> 45:07.966
We've done such good work.

45:07.966 --> 45:11.803
That is true, and the prince
is clearly fond of you.

45:11.803 --> 45:13.471
You think so?

45:13.471 --> 45:15.431
It's not my intention
to flatter you.

45:15.431 --> 45:17.767
I'm merely pointing out
a further complication.

45:17.767 --> 45:19.894
Of course.

45:19.894 --> 45:22.397
You've given me
much to consider.

45:23.857 --> 45:27.110
You may be assured
of my participation for now,

45:27.110 --> 45:30.196
but not my approval.

45:31.322 --> 45:32.699
[sighs]

45:32.699 --> 45:33.950
[door closes]

45:50.341 --> 45:52.010
I'm going out.

45:52.010 --> 45:54.053
Absolutely not.

45:58.975 --> 46:01.352
So I wanted to serve
in the military,

46:01.352 --> 46:03.146
but I'm an only child.

46:03.146 --> 46:05.815
There is no spare
for the heir.

46:05.815 --> 46:09.526
That's why my mother
was always, uh, you know.

46:09.526 --> 46:10.944
Protective?

46:10.944 --> 46:13.322
I was going to say
smothering and intrusive,

46:13.322 --> 46:15.949
but what you said
sounds much nicer.

46:15.949 --> 46:18.493
I'm sure she just wanted
what was best for you.

46:18.493 --> 46:20.454
In her own way,
that's likely true.

46:20.454 --> 46:22.372
But some things
are worth a conversation.

46:22.372 --> 46:24.374
Oh, dear.
No, I've been here before.

46:24.374 --> 46:25.876
Back to the scene of the crime.

46:25.876 --> 46:27.169
- We should go.
- Why?

46:27.169 --> 46:28.754
Thinking of getting back in?

46:28.754 --> 46:31.757
If that sheriff sees me here,
he'll go apoplectic.

46:31.757 --> 46:35.218
I'll be picking up rubbish
at the roadside for a month.

46:35.218 --> 46:37.930
You know the story
behind this fountain?

46:37.930 --> 46:40.682
The town founder built it
in tribute to his wife.

46:40.682 --> 46:43.727
Now it's where everyone goes
to make a wish.

46:43.727 --> 46:46.939
Well, you know what they say:

46:46.939 --> 46:49.232
- When in Idaho...
- No one says that.

46:49.232 --> 46:51.860
But shouldn't they?

46:53.403 --> 46:54.655
It's bound to be lucky.

46:54.655 --> 46:57.199
My grandfather's face
is on the coin.

46:57.199 --> 46:59.117
He was a lucky man.

46:59.117 --> 47:02.329
I make my own luck,
but go ahead.

47:02.329 --> 47:03.455
All right.

47:12.004 --> 47:13.589
What'd you wish for?

47:13.589 --> 47:18.094
Couldn't possibly tell you,
darling. Crown secret.

47:36.028 --> 47:39.782
Where were you
and who saw you?

47:39.782 --> 47:41.450
Nothing to fear.

47:41.450 --> 47:43.911
Miss Kelley was with me
the entire time.

47:43.911 --> 47:45.454
About Miss Kelley...

47:45.454 --> 47:48.833
She's quite extraordinary,
isn't she?

47:48.833 --> 47:51.085
She's not what I expected.

47:51.085 --> 47:53.004
You know something, Penelope?

47:53.004 --> 47:55.965
All this time, my title
has been a burden to me.

47:55.965 --> 47:57.299
This yoke around my neck

47:57.299 --> 47:59.760
requiring me to be
something I'm not.

47:59.760 --> 48:02.805
And I admit I have room for
improvement. Who doesn't, hmm?

48:02.805 --> 48:04.223
Undoubtedly.

48:04.223 --> 48:07.268
But Deidre's got me wondering,

48:07.268 --> 48:10.855
what if I can do this
just as I am?

48:10.855 --> 48:13.482
I might be the exact change
the monarchy needs.

48:13.482 --> 48:16.360
What if my instincts
are actually correct?

48:17.652 --> 48:19.362
Indeed, sir.

48:19.362 --> 48:21.281
I'm sorry to keep you up.

48:21.281 --> 48:24.701
And thank you
for your concern.

48:24.701 --> 48:27.037
See you in the morning.

48:27.037 --> 48:29.414
Good night, Your Highness.

48:34.044 --> 48:37.088
It's so frustrating
finding a table for a general.

48:37.088 --> 48:39.674
He's done battle with
half the countries in the room.

48:39.674 --> 48:43.178
Put him next to Switzerland.
They get along with everyone.

48:43.178 --> 48:45.889
- Your Majesty.
- Lady Isabella.

48:45.889 --> 48:47.265
What can I do for you?

48:47.265 --> 48:49.768
I've just had
the most wonderful idea.

48:52.312 --> 48:54.272
TV HOST:  Happy Independence Day,
 everyone!

48:54.272 --> 48:57.275
We hope you've got plans
to make it a great holiday,

48:57.275 --> 48:59.360
spending time
with family and friends.

48:59.360 --> 49:01.029
- [phone ringing]
   - In the news today,

49:01.029 --> 49:04.824
a woman calls up 911
at the Burger Time...

49:06.076 --> 49:07.827
- Hello?
- DEIDRE:  Hi, Mandy.

49:07.827 --> 49:11.790
Come to my room now.
And bring my clothes.

49:11.790 --> 49:14.876
Yes, of course.
I'll be right there, Deidre.

49:32.392 --> 49:33.769
Deidre, are you here?

49:33.769 --> 49:36.230
Oh, I'm here.
We need to talk.

49:36.230 --> 49:38.982
I brought your clothes.
Did you hear me knocking?

49:38.982 --> 49:40.359
Yes, I did hear you knocking,

49:40.359 --> 49:42.152
but I knew that you
would let yourself in.

49:42.152 --> 49:44.530
because you don't hesitate to do
whatever you want these days.

49:44.530 --> 49:47.241
I... don't know
what you mean.

49:47.241 --> 49:50.786
Look who appeared on
the cover of today's newspaper

49:50.786 --> 49:51.912
with our client

49:51.912 --> 49:54.289
in my $3,000 sundress!

49:54.289 --> 49:55.707
That dress cost $3,000?

49:55.707 --> 49:57.459
Look, I've seen your wardrobe.

49:57.459 --> 50:00.838
Borrowing my dress was a good
choice, but you should've asked.

50:00.838 --> 50:03.507
I bet now it smells like
pancakes and children.

50:03.507 --> 50:04.800
I'm so sorry.

50:04.800 --> 50:07.594
Mandy, appearing in photos
with our client

50:07.594 --> 50:09.847
is simply unacceptable.

50:09.847 --> 50:12.182
A good PR person
remains in the background.

50:12.182 --> 50:14.977
We control the narrative
without becoming part of it.

50:14.977 --> 50:17.479
You're absolutely right.

50:17.479 --> 50:19.356
And you still haven't
returned my cell phone.

50:19.356 --> 50:21.608
Yesterday was so busy
and today's Fourth of July,

50:21.608 --> 50:23.318
so no one's open.

50:23.318 --> 50:24.820
I will relay any messages.

50:24.820 --> 50:25.988

50:25.988 --> 50:28.406
No more messages,
no more phone calls.

50:28.406 --> 50:31.784
I cannot risk you ruining this
with another rookie mistake.

50:31.784 --> 50:33.911
I am meeting with
that Penelope person.

50:33.911 --> 50:36.289
Oh, but you might be contagious!

50:36.289 --> 50:39.375
We will be fine. She had chicken
pox when she was a child.

50:39.375 --> 50:42.003
Oh, okay.
But how do you know that?

50:42.003 --> 50:44.088
I spoke to her
a few minutes ago.

50:44.088 --> 50:46.549
You spoke with Penelope?

50:46.549 --> 50:50.761
[knocking]

50:50.761 --> 50:53.556
Deidre, don't open that door!

50:53.556 --> 50:54.765
Why not?

50:54.765 --> 50:58.144
You're...
not wearing lipstick.

50:58.144 --> 51:02.106
Mandy, I have pink polka dots
all over my face.

51:02.106 --> 51:04.609
I doubt she's gonna be
looking at my lips.

51:08.446 --> 51:09.488
Miss Kelley!

51:09.488 --> 51:10.823
Penelope Sheridan.

51:10.823 --> 51:12.867
Thank you so much
for coming to my room.

51:12.867 --> 51:14.994
I'm not quite ready
to be seen in public.

51:14.994 --> 51:19.457
I'm so pleased to meet you.
We have much to discuss.

51:19.457 --> 51:21.417
You sounded so different
on the phone.

51:21.417 --> 51:24.378
Is that so?
How interesting.

51:24.378 --> 51:27.965
Well, I hope Mandy
was able to serve you.

51:27.965 --> 51:31.593
Oh, she's been
quite resourceful.

51:31.593 --> 51:33.178
Hmm. Okay.

51:33.178 --> 51:35.180
Well, thank you, Mandy.
We've got this.

51:35.180 --> 51:37.682
- Hmm?
- Yes, I have some errands

51:37.682 --> 51:39.809
that I'd like you to run.

51:39.809 --> 51:44.022
But shouldn't I go
to the festival?

51:44.022 --> 51:46.858
I'm sure Penelope can handle
a photo op on her own.

51:46.858 --> 51:50.070
- But...
- Mandy, please. Do as I ask.

51:50.070 --> 51:52.530
Yes, of course.

51:52.530 --> 51:53.782
[sighs]

51:57.994 --> 52:00.830
Penelope, tell me honestly.

52:00.830 --> 52:04.125
Has she been any trouble?
It's so hard to find good help.

52:04.125 --> 52:07.879
Actually, Miss Cooper
was quite remarkable.

52:07.879 --> 52:09.714
In fact, at times

52:09.714 --> 52:13.051
it felt as though
you were right there with us.

52:13.051 --> 52:15.178
Hmm. Okay.

Have you finished
Miss Kelley's errands?

53:09.690 --> 53:10.941
You didn't tell her?

53:10.941 --> 53:12.776
No, I didn't.

53:12.776 --> 53:16.488
The disclosure would have caused
more problems than it solved.

53:16.488 --> 53:18.032
I can't thank you enough.

53:18.032 --> 53:19.616
No, you can't.

only needs to last

The prince cannot know
about any of this.

53:33.630 --> 53:34.923
Agreed.

53:37.843 --> 53:41.804
Ah, Deidre,
I was hoping you'd join us.

53:41.804 --> 53:43.598
I'm sorry to interrupt
your game,

53:43.598 --> 53:45.933
but we do have a few things
on the schedule.

53:45.933 --> 53:47.977
But it's the Fourth of July.

53:47.977 --> 53:50.063
Surely we've earned
a little downtime.

53:50.063 --> 53:52.523
Penelope, you should go
and enjoy yourself.

I would swim with my cousins,

57:13.930 --> 57:17.225
Dad would grill hamburgers,
Mom would make deviled eggs.

57:17.225 --> 57:20.645
It was the simplest thing,
but...

57:22.313 --> 57:25.900

that stick with you, you know?

57:25.900 --> 57:27.735

57:27.735 --> 57:31.781
I always think of the morning
my father taught me to shave.

57:31.781 --> 57:34.701
There were any number
of people on staff

57:34.701 --> 57:36.244

57:36.244 --> 57:39.289
We have a barber
that lives in the palace.

57:39.289 --> 57:42.375
But Father took it upon himself
to do it.

of affection, isn't it?

has a different experience.

It's not like we were poor,

the very best for us.

What are you doing here?

59:17.426 --> 59:19.929
It's impossible to get you
to return a phone call.

59:19.929 --> 59:23.057
Your coverage in the press
has been so wonderful,

59:23.057 --> 59:25.059
I simply had to join you.

59:25.059 --> 59:27.561
Everyone in Edgemere
is bursting with pride.

59:27.561 --> 59:31.232
And you must be
the legendary Deidre Kelley.

59:31.232 --> 59:35.403
Forgive my manners.
Miss Kelley, this is--

59:35.403 --> 59:40.991
Lady Isabella Vandevere.
I'm Prince Colin's fiancée.

59:40.991 --> 59:42.118
Oh.

59:42.118 --> 59:45.579
Of course.
It's a pleasure.

59:45.579 --> 59:47.832
I'm sorry.
Penelope didn't mention--

59:47.832 --> 59:49.417
That I was coming?

59:49.417 --> 59:53.087
No. I just caught a lark
and decided to pop over.

59:53.087 --> 59:56.507
Well, I'm sure you two have
a lot of catching up to do.

59:56.507 --> 59:59.510
- Excuse me.
- Deidre, wait.

59:59.510 --> 01:00:01.846
We'll talk tomorrow.
I have to go. Bye.

01:00:01.846 --> 01:00:04.682
[fireworks exploding]

01:00:11.396 --> 01:00:14.524
Colin, I wish you'd
tell me what was wrong.

01:00:14.524 --> 01:00:16.401
I've come all this way
just to see you.

01:00:16.401 --> 01:00:17.694
Nothing's wrong, Isabella.

01:00:17.694 --> 01:00:19.529
I just want to get back
to the hotel.

01:00:19.529 --> 01:00:21.531
But I would appreciate it
if you didn't introduce yourself

01:00:21.531 --> 01:00:23.158
as my fiancée.

01:00:23.158 --> 01:00:25.535
Our engagement won't be
announced for another five days.

01:00:25.535 --> 01:00:28.329
- But that's a minor quibble.
- Not to me.

01:00:28.329 --> 01:00:30.206
Colin, darling.
it's good that I'm here.

01:00:30.206 --> 01:00:33.418
In the warm light of
your newfound reputation,

01:00:33.418 --> 01:00:36.087
having an appropriate,
titled woman by your side

01:00:36.087 --> 01:00:39.507
is the perfect introduction
of our union to the world.

01:00:39.507 --> 01:00:41.384
This little
surprise trip of yours,

01:00:41.384 --> 01:00:44.220
you catching a lark and taking
a nine-hour flight unannounced,

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:47.015
was it your idea
or Mother's?

01:00:47.015 --> 01:00:48.641
It was mine entirely.

01:00:48.641 --> 01:00:50.643
Your mother encouraged it,
of course.

01:00:53.062 --> 01:00:54.522
Colin.

01:00:57.442 --> 01:00:59.986
[phone vibrating]

01:01:04.449 --> 01:01:06.910
Penelope Sheridan.

01:01:06.910 --> 01:01:09.621
Yes.

01:01:09.621 --> 01:01:12.373
Yes.

01:01:12.373 --> 01:01:16.001
I'm sorry,
would you repeat that?

01:01:24.718 --> 01:01:27.638
[sniffles]

01:01:27.638 --> 01:01:29.431
[sighs]

01:01:36.688 --> 01:01:38.690
[sobs]

01:01:38.690 --> 01:01:40.192
[exhales]

01:01:40.192 --> 01:01:43.362
It's just a job.
He's just a client.

01:01:44.404 --> 01:01:47.032
[whimpering]

01:01:50.619 --> 01:01:53.330
[vibrating]

01:01:54.498 --> 01:01:56.124
I'd wanted to talk
to Miss Kelley

01:01:56.124 --> 01:01:58.001
about incorporating you into
the press coverage tomorrow,

01:01:58.001 --> 01:01:59.545
but she's not
answering her phone.

01:01:59.545 --> 01:02:02.464
Well, we are in the mountains.

01:02:02.464 --> 01:02:03.966
Good evening,
Your Royal Highness.

01:02:03.966 --> 01:02:05.509
Good evening.

01:02:05.509 --> 01:02:08.262
The public relations executive
working with me, Deidre Kelley,

01:02:08.262 --> 01:02:09.721
could I have
her room number, please?

01:02:09.721 --> 01:02:12.224
- 3901-A.
- Thank you.

01:02:12.224 --> 01:02:14.601
Lady Isabella, I have some
messages for you. Hold on.

01:02:14.601 --> 01:02:17.312
You go on ahead.
Don't wait for me.

01:02:17.312 --> 01:02:19.648
- Are you sure?
- I'll see you in the morning.

01:02:19.648 --> 01:02:21.649
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:02:21.649 --> 01:02:23.234
[laughs]

01:02:31.617 --> 01:02:33.744
Lady Isabella!

01:02:33.744 --> 01:02:36.622
The palace only just informed me
of your arrival.

01:02:36.622 --> 01:02:38.833
What a lovely surprise.

01:02:38.833 --> 01:02:41.335
I'm glad you think so.

01:02:41.335 --> 01:02:44.255
Colin seems...
He seems troubled.

01:02:44.255 --> 01:02:46.924
Oh. You mustn't take it
personally.

01:02:46.924 --> 01:02:49.552
He's under a great deal
of pressure right now.

01:02:49.552 --> 01:02:52.179
Where is he?
I need to tell him something.

01:02:52.179 --> 01:02:55.349
He went to Deidre Kelley's room
to discuss plans for tomorrow.

01:02:55.349 --> 01:02:59.645
His Royal Highness
is going to Miss Kelley's room?

01:02:59.645 --> 01:03:01.022
Yes. There he goes now.

01:03:03.357 --> 01:03:05.902
Penelope, is there
something going on?

01:03:05.902 --> 01:03:08.696
What? No! No!
[laughs]

01:03:08.696 --> 01:03:10.156
Excuse me.

01:03:27.631 --> 01:03:30.675
Oh, look at that.
This one's going up.

01:03:34.387 --> 01:03:35.889
[ding]

01:03:35.889 --> 01:03:38.141
Okay, you two,
have a good night.

01:03:38.141 --> 01:03:39.851
MAN: Good night.

01:03:39.851 --> 01:03:42.270
- [panting]
- Penelope!

01:03:42.270 --> 01:03:45.190
I sincerely hope you're not
attempting to visit Miss Kelley

01:03:45.190 --> 01:03:47.192
in her room unchaperoned.

01:03:47.192 --> 01:03:49.444
Haven't we had enough scandals
of late?

01:03:49.444 --> 01:03:51.404
Fine, then come with me.

01:03:51.404 --> 01:03:56.034
We don't have time for that.
We have an unexpected visitor.

01:03:56.034 --> 01:03:58.578
So you know Isabella is here.

01:03:58.578 --> 01:04:00.080
Of course I do.

01:04:00.080 --> 01:04:02.707
I know everything at all times,
without exception.

01:04:02.707 --> 01:04:05.585
But Lady Isabella
is not my concern.

01:04:05.585 --> 01:04:09.923
Her Majesty the Queen
is coming to Idaho.

01:04:22.102 --> 01:04:23.645
Good morning.

01:04:23.645 --> 01:04:26.272
Deidre, I had hoped
to speak with you.

01:04:26.272 --> 01:04:28.191
Well, now you can.

01:04:28.191 --> 01:04:31.610
Congratulations on your
engagement, Your Royal Highness.

01:04:31.610 --> 01:04:34.446
Ah, thank you. I--

01:04:34.446 --> 01:04:36.407
I do wish you had
informed me sooner, sir.

01:04:36.407 --> 01:04:39.743
We could've used it to our
advantage in the press coverage.

01:04:39.743 --> 01:04:41.203
It's being announced
at the jubilee.

01:04:41.203 --> 01:04:44.665
It was and is considered
confidential.

01:04:44.665 --> 01:04:46.166
I'm so very sorry.

01:04:46.166 --> 01:04:49.795
I'm sure you can forgive
a certain amount of secrecy

01:04:49.795 --> 01:04:53.048
for the common good,
can't you, Deidre?

01:04:53.048 --> 01:04:55.801
Of course.

01:04:55.801 --> 01:04:58.387
So, a visit from Her Majesty.
How exciting.

01:04:58.387 --> 01:05:01.348
This will be great.
This will be no problem at all.

01:05:06.603 --> 01:05:08.022
Over and up.

01:05:08.022 --> 01:05:09.481
Right there.

01:05:09.481 --> 01:05:11.817
Just take those
to the ballroom.

01:05:11.817 --> 01:05:14.278
TV REPORTER:  The real excitement
 is here in Greenbriar tonight,

01:05:14.278 --> 01:05:17.406
with the surprising news
that Prince Colin of Edgemere

01:05:17.406 --> 01:05:19.700
will be joined by his mother
Queen Rosalind.

01:05:19.700 --> 01:05:21.076
What?

01:05:21.076 --> 01:05:23.787
- You want berries on the side?
- No berries, thank you.

01:05:23.787 --> 01:05:26.582
Everyone, I'd like to introduce
Penelope Sheridan,

01:05:26.582 --> 01:05:29.168
director of communications
for Her Majesty

01:05:29.168 --> 01:05:31.170
Queen Rosalind
of Edgemere.

01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:34.256
She'll be taking you through
some of the essential protocol

01:05:34.256 --> 01:05:35.923
for the queen's arrival
this evening.

01:05:35.923 --> 01:05:37.967
So keep in mind we've got
a limited number of men,

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:41.179
so we're gonna have to limit
where we put 'em.

01:05:41.179 --> 01:05:43.056
Danny, I need your help
with something.

01:05:43.056 --> 01:05:45.683
Absolutely.
Excuse me.

01:05:45.683 --> 01:05:47.351
So what can I do for you?

01:05:47.351 --> 01:05:50.188
Actually, I don't have
a dress for a formal event.

01:05:50.188 --> 01:05:51.981
Would it be
too much to ask--

01:05:51.981 --> 01:05:54.025
Miss Adelaide's Dress Shop,
right up the road.

01:05:54.025 --> 01:05:56.277
- I got you covered.
- Danny, you're a life saver.

01:05:56.277 --> 01:05:57.695
You have no idea.

01:05:59.238 --> 01:06:02.241
Danny, I asked a dress
for a formal event!

01:06:02.241 --> 01:06:05.036
This was what all the girls
wore to prom this year.

01:06:05.036 --> 01:06:08.372
Exactly!
I look like I'm going to prom!

01:06:08.372 --> 01:06:11.334
Well, I've never
bought a dress before.

01:06:11.334 --> 01:06:13.669
I didn't know
what to pick out.

01:06:14.962 --> 01:06:16.881
[whimpers]

01:06:16.881 --> 01:06:18.007
[ding]

01:06:19.217 --> 01:06:21.761
Oh, darling,
I've forgotten my handbag.

01:06:21.761 --> 01:06:25.348
- Shall we wait for you?
- No, I'll meet you downstairs.

01:06:36.859 --> 01:06:39.153
- Oh!
- I was looking for Penelope.

01:06:39.153 --> 01:06:42.948
She just went downstairs.
May I help you?

01:06:42.948 --> 01:06:46.118
Well, I only just learned
about the queen on the news,

01:06:46.118 --> 01:06:49.454
and my assistant's
not answering her phone,

01:06:49.454 --> 01:06:53.083
and clearly I don't know
what is happening.

01:06:53.083 --> 01:06:56.920
Forgive me. My manners.
My name is Deidre Kelley,

01:06:56.920 --> 01:06:59.589
and I'm currently handling
the public relations

01:06:59.589 --> 01:07:00.924
for Prince Colin.

01:07:00.924 --> 01:07:03.510
You're Deidre Kelley?

01:07:03.510 --> 01:07:05.512
I am. And you are?

01:07:06.888 --> 01:07:08.431
Intrigued.

01:07:35.834 --> 01:07:40.046
Oh, my, you've gone native.

01:07:40.046 --> 01:07:42.924
This was all I could get
on short notice.

01:07:42.924 --> 01:07:44.968
Well, I think
it's a lovely dress.

01:07:44.968 --> 01:07:46.719
- No, you don't.
- Well, no.

01:07:46.719 --> 01:07:50.264
It's quite hideous, isn't it?
But who cares, Deidre?

01:07:50.264 --> 01:07:51.932
I mean, look around.

01:07:51.932 --> 01:07:55.311
Everything that's happened,
it's because of you.

01:07:55.311 --> 01:07:57.396
This is your triumph.

01:07:58.480 --> 01:07:59.815
She's here.

01:08:10.492 --> 01:08:11.660
Hello.

01:08:11.660 --> 01:08:13.454
Welcome to Greenbriar,
Your Highness.

01:08:13.454 --> 01:08:14.622
Thank you.

01:08:14.622 --> 01:08:16.624
Hello.

01:08:16.624 --> 01:08:18.167
Hello.

01:08:24.465 --> 01:08:27.176
- Colin.
- Mother.

01:08:29.845 --> 01:08:34.058
Oh, Mandy,
what have you been up to, hmm?

01:08:39.854 --> 01:08:41.899
MANDY: Deidre!
You're feeling better.

01:08:41.899 --> 01:08:43.734
That's wonderful.

01:08:43.734 --> 01:08:47.904
Listen, I know this looks bad,
but I can explain everything.

01:08:47.904 --> 01:08:51.073
I was suspicious of you
from the moment I met you.

01:08:51.073 --> 01:08:54.118
Well, yeah,
the feeling was mutual.

01:08:54.118 --> 01:08:57.205
Both of you, shh.
The queen is here.

01:08:58.456 --> 01:09:00.582
Thank you, everyone.

01:09:00.582 --> 01:09:02.752
It has been my great delight

01:09:02.752 --> 01:09:04.671
observing how
His Royal Highness,

01:09:04.671 --> 01:09:05.921
the Crown Prince,

01:09:05.921 --> 01:09:08.216
has spent his time
in Greenbriar.

01:09:08.216 --> 01:09:10.885
As a monarch and as a mother,

01:09:10.885 --> 01:09:14.013
I have been curious to see
what it is about this community

01:09:14.013 --> 01:09:16.057
that could awaken
a spirit of service

01:09:16.057 --> 01:09:18.518
and leadership in my son.

01:09:18.518 --> 01:09:21.645
And judging by
this lovely welcome,

01:09:21.645 --> 01:09:23.398
I'm beginning to understand.

01:09:23.398 --> 01:09:26.776
Now, on to more
pressing matters.

01:09:26.776 --> 01:09:29.362
- I'm simply famished.
- [laughter]

01:09:29.362 --> 01:09:30.738
Shall we continue to dinner?

01:09:36.911 --> 01:09:38.496
Oh, no.

01:09:38.496 --> 01:09:41.416
Isabella, I wondered
what had become of you.

01:09:41.416 --> 01:09:44.460
Darling, I believe there's some
introductions to be made.

01:09:44.460 --> 01:09:48.589
Your Royal Highness,
at last we meet.

01:09:48.589 --> 01:09:50.383
My name is Deidre Kelley.

01:09:51.968 --> 01:09:53.678
I'm sorry.
This is Deidre Kelley.

01:09:53.678 --> 01:09:57.097
No, darling, there seems to be
a bit of confusion there.

01:09:57.097 --> 01:09:59.433
The woman here
in the hideous dress,

01:09:59.433 --> 01:10:01.393
to whom we have entrusted
the reputation

01:10:01.393 --> 01:10:02.894
and future of the monarchy

01:10:02.894 --> 01:10:05.981
is Deidre Kelley's assistant,
Mandy Cooper.

01:10:05.981 --> 01:10:07.649
Isn't that right, dear?

01:10:07.649 --> 01:10:11.069
I-I don't understand.

01:10:11.069 --> 01:10:12.904
I just...

01:10:12.904 --> 01:10:15.157
I wanted to prove
I could do the job,

01:10:15.157 --> 01:10:18.535
that I could execute a plan
and the ketchup and...

01:10:18.535 --> 01:10:20.078
Well, I didn't see the harm.

01:10:20.078 --> 01:10:22.539
Prince Colin was just
another client, and...

01:10:22.539 --> 01:10:24.625
I didn't expect that I would...

01:10:24.625 --> 01:10:27.753
- You lied to me?
- I didn't mean to.

01:10:27.753 --> 01:10:29.755
I just got so caught up
in the lie,

01:10:29.755 --> 01:10:31.089
I couldn't find my way
back out of it,

01:10:31.089 --> 01:10:34.926
and I felt awful
the whole time,

01:10:34.926 --> 01:10:39.556
but... I did do the job.

01:10:39.556 --> 01:10:42.601
Your reputation is restored,
and the press loves you.

01:10:42.601 --> 01:10:45.771
Colin, you even called it
my triumph.

01:10:45.771 --> 01:10:47.773
That's true.

01:10:47.773 --> 01:10:50.817
You've done your job very well.
It's quite impressive.

01:10:50.817 --> 01:10:53.445
You're capable of tactics
I never expected from you.

01:10:53.445 --> 01:10:57.115
Colin, don't say that.
I'm...

01:10:58.617 --> 01:11:00.826
- I'm your friend.
- My friend?

01:11:00.826 --> 01:11:03.037
I don't even know you!

01:11:03.037 --> 01:11:05.956
Isabella, alert Penelope.

01:11:05.956 --> 01:11:08.334
We return to Edgemere tonight.

01:11:18.010 --> 01:11:20.054
Well...

01:11:20.054 --> 01:11:21.514
that's unexpected.

01:11:21.514 --> 01:11:25.101
You have lied to me with
every breath this entire week.

01:11:25.101 --> 01:11:30.356
You deceived royalty,
not to mention an entire town.

01:11:30.356 --> 01:11:33.025
I strongly suspect you owe me
money for a cell phone,

01:11:33.025 --> 01:11:35.528
and I wouldn't be surprised
if you arranged for that toddler

01:11:35.528 --> 01:11:37.238
to give me chicken pox.

01:11:37.238 --> 01:11:41.158
I don't think I've ever seen
deception on such a level.

01:11:42.910 --> 01:11:45.204
I'm gonna fly you
back to New York tomorrow.

01:11:45.204 --> 01:11:47.873
You will pack up your desk,
and we are done.

01:11:53.295 --> 01:11:57.383
Well, I'm going to go
and salvage the banquet

01:11:57.383 --> 01:12:00.761

reaches the queen.

01:12:03.222 --> 01:12:04.807

01:12:18.653 --> 01:12:19.863

01:12:21.948 --> 01:12:23.908
Do you know
the worst of it?

01:12:23.908 --> 01:12:25.994
I was foolish enough
to become hopeful.

01:12:25.994 --> 01:12:27.579
I should've known
that any happy outcome

01:12:27.579 --> 01:12:29.038
must be based on a lie.

01:12:29.038 --> 01:12:30.957
I lied about my name
and my job,

01:12:30.957 --> 01:12:33.918
but everything else that
happened was true, I swear.

01:12:33.918 --> 01:12:35.712
How can I trust that?

01:12:35.712 --> 01:12:38.006
How can I believe
anything you say, Deidre?

01:12:38.006 --> 01:12:41.968
See? I don't even
know your name!

01:12:41.968 --> 01:12:44.846
It's Mandy Cooper.

01:12:44.846 --> 01:12:47.098
Colin, I care about you
very much.

01:12:47.098 --> 01:12:50.435
If you cared about me, you'd
have trusted me with the truth.

01:12:50.435 --> 01:12:53.938
I'm sorry!

01:12:53.938 --> 01:13:00.653
But why did you never mention
Isabella to me, not even once?

01:13:00.653 --> 01:13:03.865
You know why.

01:13:03.865 --> 01:13:06.493
And now I feel very foolish.

01:13:07.785 --> 01:13:09.454
Goodbye, Miss Cooper.

01:13:09.454 --> 01:13:13.373
[sobbing]

01:14:10.347 --> 01:14:13.141
[clears throat]
You wanted to see me?

01:14:13.141 --> 01:14:17.853
Yes. I just read your report.
Is it the truth?

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:20.648
It's everything I did, yes.

01:14:20.648 --> 01:14:25.194
Well, there are some masterful
maneuvers here, Mandy.

01:14:25.194 --> 01:14:27.029
You have real talent.

01:14:27.029 --> 01:14:30.741
I can't afford to have that
brain working for someone else,

01:14:30.741 --> 01:14:33.619
so I have decided not
to terminate your employment.

01:14:33.619 --> 01:14:35.538
Really?

01:14:35.538 --> 01:14:38.666
Well, if I were being honest,
I'd say the stunt reminded me

01:14:38.666 --> 01:14:43.045
of something I would do
at your age.

01:14:43.045 --> 01:14:45.673
Yes, I haven't met anyone
with that amount of chutzpah

01:14:45.673 --> 01:14:49.218
in a long time.
You're quite an asset.

01:14:49.218 --> 01:14:51.512
However, if you decide

01:14:51.512 --> 01:14:54.724
to execute some devious
master plan in the future,

01:14:54.724 --> 01:14:57.935
I expect to be included.

01:14:57.935 --> 01:14:59.687
I don't know what to say.

01:14:59.687 --> 01:15:03.107
Say, "Thank you, Deidre."

01:15:03.107 --> 01:15:05.067
Thank you, Deidre.

01:15:05.067 --> 01:15:08.195
There's just one thing
I can't figure out.

01:15:08.195 --> 01:15:09.405
What's that?

01:15:09.405 --> 01:15:11.699
Why didn't you fight for him?

01:15:11.699 --> 01:15:12.867
I'm sorry?

01:15:12.867 --> 01:15:15.786
Look at this picture, Mandy.

01:15:15.786 --> 01:15:18.914
That is the face
of someone smitten.

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:23.084
Why didn't you fight for him?

01:15:24.419 --> 01:15:26.755
Because he discovered
my rich tapestry

01:15:26.755 --> 01:15:29.758
of lies and deception,

01:15:29.758 --> 01:15:32.177
he's getting married
to Lady Isabella,

01:15:32.177 --> 01:15:35.180
and he basically said
he can never trust me again.

01:15:37.974 --> 01:15:42.228
So I think it's probably best
we just let this one go.

01:15:42.228 --> 01:15:45.440
Hmm. If you say so.

01:15:47.609 --> 01:15:50.236
I have an invitation
to the Queen's Jubilee

01:15:50.236 --> 01:15:51.446
tomorrow night in Edgemere

01:15:51.446 --> 01:15:54.240
as a thank-you
for our efforts.

01:15:54.240 --> 01:15:58.078
But I'm not the person deserving
of that gratitude, am I?

01:15:59.329 --> 01:16:01.623
But the invitation's
for you, not me.

01:16:01.623 --> 01:16:05.669
Oh, so now you have a problem
using my name.

01:16:05.669 --> 01:16:07.253
But I have nothing to wear,

01:16:07.253 --> 01:16:11.883
and I would have to fly out
tonight to make it in time.

01:16:11.883 --> 01:16:14.636
Cinderella...

01:16:14.636 --> 01:16:16.763
meet your fairy godmother.

01:16:30.818 --> 01:16:32.695
Your arm, sir.

01:16:37.157 --> 01:16:39.284
Your Highness, I have
the official statement

01:16:39.284 --> 01:16:40.661
about your engagement.

01:16:40.661 --> 01:16:42.705
All I need is your approval.

01:16:42.705 --> 01:16:44.873
I'm sure if it meets
with Mother's approval,

01:16:44.873 --> 01:16:46.333
I have nothing to add.

01:16:46.333 --> 01:16:48.961
Oh, dear, we're regressing.

01:16:48.961 --> 01:16:51.171
After we made such progress.

01:16:51.171 --> 01:16:54.299
For heaven's sake,
what more do you people want?

01:16:54.299 --> 01:16:56.510
I am fulfilling every single
duty to the crown.

01:16:56.510 --> 01:16:58.345
I understand my responsibility,

01:16:58.345 --> 01:17:00.139
and I have made my peace
with it.

01:17:00.139 --> 01:17:03.726
Preston, may we have the room,
please?

01:17:03.726 --> 01:17:05.185
Madam.

01:17:10.149 --> 01:17:14.027
Colin, do you know what made
your time in Greenbriar

01:17:14.027 --> 01:17:16.196
so extraordinary?

01:17:16.196 --> 01:17:18.198
It wasn't that you
behaved yourself,

01:17:18.198 --> 01:17:20.075
although admittedly
that was refreshing.

01:17:20.075 --> 01:17:22.870
It was that you
followed your heart.

01:17:22.870 --> 01:17:27.207
You allowed yourself to be
true to your instincts,

01:17:27.207 --> 01:17:30.376
showing kindness
and concern for others.

01:17:30.376 --> 01:17:34.380
It was my first glimpse
of the kind of monarch

01:17:34.380 --> 01:17:36.382
that you will one day become,

01:17:36.382 --> 01:17:40.052
and it filled me
with such pride.

01:17:42.597 --> 01:17:45.433
And that's why I allowed
Miss Cooper's little deception

01:17:45.433 --> 01:17:46.559
to continue.

01:17:46.559 --> 01:17:48.644
You knew?

01:17:48.644 --> 01:17:51.773
Of course I knew.
I have told you repeatedly:

01:17:51.773 --> 01:17:54.400
I know everything
that's happening at all times.

01:17:54.400 --> 01:17:58.154
Miss Cooper brought out
the best in you.

01:17:58.154 --> 01:18:01.574
That doesn't go away
just because she has.

01:18:01.574 --> 01:18:03.242
But it was all based on a lie.

01:18:03.242 --> 01:18:08.080
Oh, a silly voice here,
and a false name there.

01:18:08.080 --> 01:18:12.251
In all fairness, you weren't
forthcoming with her either.

01:18:12.251 --> 01:18:14.295
I know that.

01:18:14.295 --> 01:18:17.298
But there's not much
I can do about that now.

01:18:18.591 --> 01:18:22.261
One day you will rule
our country,

01:18:22.261 --> 01:18:25.598
and your decisions
will not buckle

01:18:25.598 --> 01:18:27.058
under the weight
of your title.

01:18:27.058 --> 01:18:29.185
They will be fortified by it.

01:18:29.185 --> 01:18:32.647
Just consider
all the consequences

01:18:32.647 --> 01:18:36.024
and then do what you
genuinely feel is best.

01:18:36.024 --> 01:18:40.237

in the right direction.

never for a moment been in love.

At least not one
we'd ever actually want.

01:20:02.860 --> 01:20:05.613
A royal marriage
is about far more than love.

01:20:05.613 --> 01:20:08.741
It is about duty and
responsibility to the monarchy,

maintaining and preserving over
a hundred years of tradition.

01:22:34.760 --> 01:22:36.511
I would appreciate
your support,

01:22:36.511 --> 01:22:38.263
if you're in a position
to offer it.

01:22:38.263 --> 01:22:42.934
My darling boy, don't you know
you mean the world to me?

01:22:42.934 --> 01:22:46.188
I hope you find
what you're looking for.

01:22:46.188 --> 01:22:48.732
And you will, I know it.

01:22:48.732 --> 01:22:50.859
Thank you, Mother.

01:23:14.173 --> 01:23:17.218
Well, that was faster
than I expected.

01:23:18.803 --> 01:23:21.764
You look absolutely perfect.

01:23:21.764 --> 01:23:25.726
Not quite.
I forgot to pack shoes.

01:23:25.726 --> 01:23:27.520
That's even more perfect.

01:23:28.395 --> 01:23:30.231
Colin, I owe you an apology.

01:23:30.231 --> 01:23:32.691
There's no need to fly halfway
around the world for that.

01:23:32.691 --> 01:23:34.401
You could've just sent
a nice note.

01:23:34.401 --> 01:23:38.322
I wanted to see you.
I know you're getting married,

01:23:38.322 --> 01:23:42.159
and I have no intention
of getting in the way of that,

01:23:42.159 --> 01:23:44.662
but...

01:23:44.662 --> 01:23:48.707
I wanted to earn your trust,
if you'll let me.

01:23:48.707 --> 01:23:50.668
I want us to be friends again.

01:23:50.668 --> 01:23:53.045
That's very kind of you,
thank you,

01:23:53.045 --> 01:23:56.006
and I appreciate the apology,

01:23:56.006 --> 01:23:59.260
but I wasn't entirely honest
with you either,

01:23:59.260 --> 01:24:01.219
and I'm truly sorry.

01:24:01.219 --> 01:24:03.304

quite uncertain.

It's very exciting.

01:24:20.447 --> 01:24:22.824
Would you care to dance?

01:24:22.824 --> 01:24:24.367
I don't know how to waltz.

01:24:24.367 --> 01:24:26.161
You'll pick it up
very quickly.

01:24:26.161 --> 01:24:27.787
You're very determined.
