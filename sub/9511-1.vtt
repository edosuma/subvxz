WEBVTT

01:06.266 --> 01:09.394
Hold it, hold it, hold it. Georgia.

01:09.502 --> 01:12.665
Sister Abernathy is singing
three times as loud as you...

01:12.772 --> 01:15.138
and she just had her tonsils out, sugar.

01:17.777 --> 01:22.043
- How you gonna account for that?
- I'm sorry, Reverend, I thought I was.

01:22.148 --> 01:24.048
It's all right, baby. It's all right.

01:24.150 --> 01:27.517
Now, as an incentive for us all
to be in full voice...

01:27.620 --> 01:31.283
on Sunday, our very own
Senator Dillings will be here...

01:31.391 --> 01:34.952
to help us kick off our Community
Redevelopment Program. Amen.

01:35.061 --> 01:36.619
Amen!

02:22.475 --> 02:23.772
Hi, ma'am.

02:24.377 --> 02:25.435
Okay.

02:27.514 --> 02:31.211
Okay, here we go.
Domino, Lean Cuisine.

02:32.018 --> 02:35.419
You take the paper towel, right?
Oh, and mayonnaise.

02:36.956 --> 02:37.945
That's it.

02:38.057 --> 02:39.046
- That's it?
- Yes.

02:54.440 --> 02:58.171
- Hey, little mama, that pretty.
- Check it out, man. Yeah.

02:58.278 --> 03:01.270
Let me holla at you for a sec.
Don't you got no time for nobody?

03:21.167 --> 03:22.634
Hey, Miss Byrd.

03:23.036 --> 03:25.800
Hey. Any problems with the car today?

03:25.905 --> 03:28.430
Some gunshots.
Nobody mess with the car, though.

03:28.541 --> 03:31.908
Okay, Darius, so you come by
in exactly 75 minutes and I'll be ready.

03:32.011 --> 03:33.740
Yes, ma'am. Me, too.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.280
<i>Yeah! Welcome back!</i>
<i>Welcome back to</i> Emeril Live!

03:40.386 --> 03:43.082
<i>Emeril Lagasse here. We're</i>
<i>making chicken four ways tonight.</i>

03:43.189 --> 03:46.181
<i>Wait till you see this dish</i>
<i>that I got coming up right now for you.</i>

03:46.292 --> 03:48.590
Poulet Tchoupitoulas.

03:48.695 --> 03:50.993
<i>Poulet Tchoupitoulas.</i>

03:51.097 --> 03:52.359
<i>Oh, yeah, baby!</i>

03:53.166 --> 03:55.828
<i>You can't see this at home,</i>
<i>but he is happy, this chicken.</i>

03:55.935 --> 03:58.495
<i>He's clapping for Doc Gibbs</i>
<i>and the Emeril Live Band!</i>

03:58.605 --> 04:00.163
<i>He's just... Oh, yeah.</i>

04:03.743 --> 04:05.370
<i>You gotta split him in half...</i>

04:05.478 --> 04:08.106
<i>and then we're gonna make</i>
<i>what I call a paste.</i>

04:08.681 --> 04:11.275
<i>This chicken, skin</i>- <i>side down...</i>

04:11.384 --> 04:12.851
Skin-side down.

04:13.686 --> 04:16.620
<i>Now, for this</i> Poulet Tchoupitoulas...

04:16.723 --> 04:19.190
<i>maybe some of this fumé blanc</i>
<i>would work.</i>

04:19.291 --> 04:22.318
<i>So, a little splash like this. Okay?</i>

04:22.428 --> 04:23.952
<i>Or a big splash!</i>

04:25.531 --> 04:26.691
<i>Like that!</i>

04:28.701 --> 04:32.797
<i>Bread pudding with onions,</i>
<i>with sweet corn, and andouille sausage.</i>

04:32.905 --> 04:34.395
<i>Okay? Oh, yeah.</i>

04:34.507 --> 04:37.704
<i>'Cause the</i> Poulet Tchoupitoulas <i>with</i>
<i>the bread pudding.</i>

04:37.844 --> 04:38.868
<i>Bam!</i>

04:39.779 --> 04:41.838
Look at that! That's looking good!

04:49.722 --> 04:51.690
I don't suppose you're gonna have any?

04:51.791 --> 04:54.589
Lord, no.
I don't eat nothing but my Lean Cuisine.

04:56.329 --> 04:58.024
What is that book, anyway?

04:59.832 --> 05:03.359
- How do you like them greens?
- Oh, man, it's the bomb!

05:03.469 --> 05:05.835
Well, good.
I mixed them this time, you know.

05:05.938 --> 05:07.530
Collard greens...

05:07.640 --> 05:11.201
and of course, your favorite,
turnip greens.

05:12.745 --> 05:15.646
- And I got plenty for your grandpa.
- Cool, thanks.

05:22.755 --> 05:23.881
Sugar!

05:25.525 --> 05:27.390
I just got these pants.

05:30.830 --> 05:32.491
Always doing this.

05:59.325 --> 06:01.088
Darius, what are you doing?

06:01.728 --> 06:03.423
That is my private property.

06:03.529 --> 06:06.225
- I was just looking. What is it?
- It's nothing.

06:06.332 --> 06:08.630
It's just what it says, just possibilities.

06:08.735 --> 06:10.635
Just things I'm interested in.

06:11.504 --> 06:12.937
Including this guy?

06:14.107 --> 06:15.699
- He your boyfriend?
- No.

06:16.776 --> 06:18.300
He's just an idea.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.436
I mean, he's a real guy...

06:20.546 --> 06:23.037
Why are you snooping around
my stuff, anyway?

06:29.722 --> 06:31.155
So, what's his name?

06:31.824 --> 06:32.813
Who?

06:34.093 --> 06:35.651
None of your business.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.724
I'll tell you what his name is.
His name is lucky mother...

06:38.831 --> 06:39.889
What?

06:40.166 --> 06:42.157
I know you might as well
go ahead leave my house now...

06:42.268 --> 06:44.031
if you're gonna be using
that kind of language.

06:44.137 --> 06:45.866
I'm sorry,
but short of you telling me his name...

06:45.972 --> 06:47.530
I don't know anything better to call him.

06:47.640 --> 06:48.971
His name is Sean.

06:49.709 --> 06:52.439
- Sean Williams.
- Sean Williams, huh?

06:52.545 --> 06:54.638
And you better not say anything
to anybody.

06:54.747 --> 06:55.736
I ain't.

07:02.422 --> 07:05.255
There he is, there he is.
Okay, I'm not gonna say anything.

07:05.358 --> 07:07.986
- You just talk to him.
- No, I'm not going to talk to him.

07:10.863 --> 07:12.888
...just to say hello. All right?

07:12.999 --> 07:15.194
Go and talk to him. Stop him.

07:16.569 --> 07:19.595
- Good morning, Miss Byrd.
- Mr. Williams.

07:19.972 --> 07:22.566
What was that? Was that power flirting?

07:22.675 --> 07:23.869
I don't know.

07:23.976 --> 07:26.877
Oh, my, my, my.
You could crack a walnut with that ass.

07:26.979 --> 07:28.037
Girl, stop!

07:31.184 --> 07:32.913
Don't you have somewhere to be?

07:33.019 --> 07:34.111
You know what we need to do?

07:34.220 --> 07:37.314
We need to get you out of these
frumpy clothes and into something...

07:37.423 --> 07:40.790
- that shows off the real estate a little bit.
- No. Rochelle! This is a workplace.

07:40.893 --> 07:42.417
Seriously. Then you need
to go down there...

07:42.528 --> 07:43.825
and you need to talk to Mr. Big Stuff...

07:43.930 --> 07:45.921
and you need to tell him
what you want for Christmas.

07:46.032 --> 07:48.296
- You just sit in his lap...
- Hey! Rochelle, come on, now.

07:48.401 --> 07:50.164
What? No...
What are you worried about?

07:50.269 --> 07:51.361
That they're going to fire you
in this place?

07:51.471 --> 07:52.597
Take your coffee and go!

07:52.705 --> 07:55.196
You're the best damn worker they got
in this whole damn place.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.333
They're not gonna fire you.
You're just scared.

07:57.443 --> 08:00.173
You're scared of some man
getting a hold of all that booty of yours!

08:00.279 --> 08:01.507
Would you stop?

08:02.849 --> 08:04.544
He could hold my booty.

08:07.520 --> 08:08.509
Sean!

08:09.388 --> 08:10.650
<i>Attention Kragen shoppers...</i>

08:10.756 --> 08:12.951
<i>stop in our health clinic</i>
<i>on the second floor...</i>

08:13.059 --> 08:15.084
<i>to make sure your holidays...</i>

08:15.194 --> 08:16.957
Right. This piece goes here.

08:19.031 --> 08:20.396
There we go.

08:22.068 --> 08:25.697
It's still crooked, but, yeah, that's good.

08:25.805 --> 08:27.796
- It's good, huh?
- No, no, no.

08:27.907 --> 08:32.707
"Lip of shelf to fit
between grill bottom and leg brace."

08:35.014 --> 08:37.914
That was supposed to be put on last,
but that's all right.

08:38.017 --> 08:39.075
Thank you.

08:51.864 --> 08:54.059
- Miss Byrd.
- Georgia.

08:55.868 --> 08:59.929
You had some light bulbs to change
or something, remember?

09:00.840 --> 09:04.241
Yeah! Oh, yeah, yeah, light bulbs.

09:05.478 --> 09:07.309
Light bulbs.
You know, they be relying on me...

09:07.413 --> 09:08.402
Hey, I'll see you later.

09:08.514 --> 09:09.811
Yeah. Sure. Yeah.

09:15.755 --> 09:17.780
Is there something I can help you with?

09:19.325 --> 09:20.758
That's quite a nice grill.

09:21.494 --> 09:24.554
- Stainless steel, huh?
- Yeah. Durable.

09:26.165 --> 09:29.293
- Easy to clean?
- You just hose it down.

09:29.669 --> 09:31.398
Just hose it down, huh?

09:39.912 --> 09:41.675
- Are you on your break?
- Yes.

09:42.381 --> 09:45.714
Well, that's why I'm here.
I wanted to ask you something.

09:45.818 --> 09:47.012
Ask me what?

09:51.290 --> 09:54.521
Do you think I'll get my store discount
if I buy this thing?

09:55.294 --> 09:57.922
Well, of course.
Of course you get your store discount.

09:58.030 --> 10:00.157
But I just sold you a grill last week,
remember?

10:00.266 --> 10:03.827
Yeah. But that was a hibachi.
That was for traveling.

10:06.272 --> 10:09.105
I think somebody should've told you
when you got this thing...

10:09.208 --> 10:12.837
that you're supposed to have a lawn
or a backyard or something.

10:12.945 --> 10:16.881
Okay, how about a little more lifting
and a little less talking?

10:18.150 --> 10:21.051
That looks good. Smells good, too.

10:21.520 --> 10:24.045
All right, there you have it.

10:24.156 --> 10:28.490
A simple Creole roasted duck hash
<i>en croûte.</i>

10:29.362 --> 10:31.626
Now, what you can do with this here...

10:31.998 --> 10:34.592
is you can take a little bit
of the parsley...

10:34.700 --> 10:37.999
and onion if you like,
if that's what you like.

10:38.104 --> 10:41.699
But here's what I like to do.
Now, this is only for the brave ones.

10:42.174 --> 10:44.642
For those
who don't get a lot of heartburn.

10:45.511 --> 10:49.777
I like to kick some of that hot sauce
on there, spice it up something.

10:49.882 --> 10:52.112
Please, come on and enjoy some.

10:55.254 --> 10:56.551
Excuse me.

10:57.757 --> 11:00.191
Now, I made this special for you.

11:00.292 --> 11:01.691
I left the pine nuts out...

11:01.794 --> 11:04.262
'cause I know they get up
under your bridgework sometimes.

11:04.363 --> 11:05.625
Aren't you sweet?

11:05.731 --> 11:07.289
- Thank you.
- Excuse me.

11:07.400 --> 11:12.030
Are you bucking for General
of the Salvation Army or what?

11:12.171 --> 11:13.866
Stop feeding the moochers.

11:15.541 --> 11:16.530
We always have...

11:16.642 --> 11:19.076
our Wednesday morning
sales demonstration, Mr. Adamian.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.476
No, no.
That's exactly the kind of thinking...

11:21.580 --> 11:24.014
that put this store in Chapter 11
in the first place.

11:24.116 --> 11:27.347
Now, Mr. Kragen, he's trying
to change the culture around here.

11:27.453 --> 11:29.944
And by culture, I mean money.

11:30.056 --> 11:32.354
Now, if you care about
your future here...

11:32.458 --> 11:35.086
I suggest
you get with the program, Miss Byrd.

11:35.194 --> 11:37.287
Have you read this? Kragen's awesome.

11:37.396 --> 11:39.694
- Everybody got one.
- Read it again.

11:41.167 --> 11:42.361
Yeah. Yup?

11:43.069 --> 11:44.036
Yup. Yup.

11:44.170 --> 11:47.401
Well, then, hire another Santa.
Of course, he has to be fat.

11:47.506 --> 11:48.803
<i>Attention Kragen shoppers...</i>

11:48.908 --> 11:51.536
<i>today's pre</i>- <i>Christmas sales</i>
<i>are on the second level.</i>

11:56.515 --> 11:58.983
Georgia. I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to scare you. I'm sorry.

11:59.085 --> 12:01.349
Oh, my God. I'm sorry.

12:01.454 --> 12:03.479
No. I'm sorry.

12:03.589 --> 12:06.524
I'm kind of in my own little world
up here.

12:07.293 --> 12:08.885
What brings you to cookware?

12:08.994 --> 12:11.724
It's that smell, to tell you the truth.
I can't help it.

12:11.831 --> 12:15.096
It wafts down the escalator,
usually I can resist, but...

12:15.401 --> 12:16.368
Oh.

12:16.702 --> 12:18.465
Oh, well, please have some.

12:19.071 --> 12:20.868
I'll probably get fired over this.

12:20.973 --> 12:23.305
Did you ever have a smell
that triggers a memory?

12:23.409 --> 12:25.775
This smells like my mama's house.

12:27.747 --> 12:29.044
Thank you.

12:38.791 --> 12:42.022
That's incredible. Incredible.

12:42.128 --> 12:44.790
You know,
I'm just trying to sell the cookware.

12:46.265 --> 12:48.324
Where did you become a chef?

12:48.434 --> 12:51.130
France, or someplace European
or something?

12:51.237 --> 12:54.536
Oh, no, I'm not a chef.
I've never been to France.

12:55.407 --> 12:57.967
I ain't never been further north
than Mobile, Alabama.

12:58.077 --> 13:02.810
You know, it's just a hobby.
Something I really enjoy doing.

13:02.915 --> 13:06.009
- A hobby, huh?
- I never trained or anything.

13:06.786 --> 13:08.981
- You gonna train?
- I don't know.

13:09.088 --> 13:11.318
Someday. Maybe.

13:12.258 --> 13:16.319
Look. I was wondering,
sometime, if you're free...

13:17.229 --> 13:18.992
I thought maybe we could...

13:19.932 --> 13:22.025
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'll get it. I'll get it.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.101
You got...

13:23.202 --> 13:24.567
Oh... Georgia!

13:41.220 --> 13:43.916
Whoa! What happened? Is she okay?

13:44.023 --> 13:45.320
She hit her head.

13:46.192 --> 13:49.218
- Give me a hand, please.
- So what? It's just a bump.

13:50.262 --> 13:52.628
Watch her head.
Don't hit her head again.

14:31.503 --> 14:35.132
Miss Byrd, can you hear me?
Can you hear me, Miss Byrd?

14:35.574 --> 14:38.771
Can you hear the words
that are coming out of my mouth?

14:38.878 --> 14:40.937
How many fingers am I holding up?

14:41.046 --> 14:43.844
Is it one, two, or more?

14:45.718 --> 14:48.744
- What's going on here?
- Georgia, are you okay? Georgia?

14:49.121 --> 14:50.213
Oh, man.

14:50.322 --> 14:51.846
I think we should do a CAT scan.

14:51.957 --> 14:53.515
What?
That's a big ticket number, isn't it?

14:53.626 --> 14:55.594
I didn't think we did that kind of thing
around here.

14:55.694 --> 14:58.185
Well, we got a new machine.
Used, but new to us.

14:58.297 --> 14:59.821
Yeah, I don't know.

14:59.932 --> 15:02.924
Sir, there could be
a huge workman's comp payout...

15:03.035 --> 15:04.263
if we don't follow procedure.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.167
All right,
only if it's absolutely necessary.

15:06.272 --> 15:09.139
I knew you'd understand.
Paperwork. Follow me.

15:10.776 --> 15:14.507
- Are you okay, Miss Byrd?
- Kind of nice to be off my feet.

15:15.481 --> 15:16.573
Here we go.

15:24.590 --> 15:27.923
<i>Now, don't worry now, Miss Byrd.</i>
<i>Everything will be just fine.</i>

15:35.000 --> 15:36.058
What?

15:38.404 --> 15:40.031
No, this can't be right.

15:42.975 --> 15:44.306
Oh, my God.

15:45.711 --> 15:47.042
Oh, my God.

15:54.720 --> 15:57.450
<i>We're just going to try</i>
<i>one more time, Miss Byrd.</i>

15:58.490 --> 15:59.821
This is not good.

16:00.993 --> 16:02.654
This is not good at all.

16:04.430 --> 16:05.829
What are we looking at?

16:05.931 --> 16:09.264
Well, we're looking at the results
of a virus you have, ma'am.

16:09.902 --> 16:12.336
- Virus?
- I believe it to be Lampington's disease.

16:12.438 --> 16:15.874
It's very rare and it's very harmless,
in most cases.

16:16.809 --> 16:18.538
- In most cases?
- Yes.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.009
What about my case?

16:20.112 --> 16:23.639
Well, I thought I'd misread
the first scan, so I did the second scan.

16:23.749 --> 16:25.910
But that just confirmed it, you see?

16:27.219 --> 16:29.346
- Okay, so I have Lampington's?
- Yes.

16:29.755 --> 16:32.747
Well, which one do I have
if not the harmless one?

16:32.858 --> 16:35.554
Ma'am, I'm very sorry to tell you...

16:35.661 --> 16:36.593
But I...

16:36.695 --> 16:38.754
You see,
in my opinion it's the kind that...

16:38.864 --> 16:42.322
Ma'am, please! This is very, very
difficult for me. I'm just...

16:42.835 --> 16:43.927
Oh, dear.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.437
I need to lie down.

16:47.706 --> 16:49.401
You see this area here?

16:49.508 --> 16:52.033
- This is your mass.
- My mass?

16:52.144 --> 16:53.475
Your tumor.

16:53.645 --> 16:57.081
And this, and this, and this.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.145
I'm sorry, Georgia,
but the virus has caused...

17:01.253 --> 17:03.744
a very advanced case
of Lampington's lesions.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.919
Okay, well, exactly what
does that mean, Lampington's lesions?

17:07.026 --> 17:09.961
And Dr. Gupta hasn't told you anything
about this, right?

17:10.061 --> 17:11.654
Well, I tried.

17:13.098 --> 17:14.258
Thanks.

17:15.733 --> 17:17.964
Without treatment, it's terminal.

17:19.438 --> 17:21.872
What? Like I'm gonna die?

17:22.473 --> 17:23.941
I'm very, very sorry.

17:24.410 --> 17:26.070
But I feel fine.

17:26.178 --> 17:29.204
I feel great.
I just finished a Fat Flush and...

17:29.314 --> 17:31.680
No dizziness or fainting?

17:31.784 --> 17:34.685
No. I got a tiny bump on my head,
that's all.

17:34.787 --> 17:37.915
It's diabolical. Such a sneaky disease.

17:38.690 --> 17:43.354
I'm afraid, in your condition,
you've got about three weeks to live.

17:43.595 --> 17:46.689
What? I got three weeks to live?

17:47.299 --> 17:48.561
Are you shitting me?

17:48.667 --> 17:51.363
Four on the outside. I'm sorry.

17:51.470 --> 17:55.201
You're sorry? Well, I'm sorry.
I can't accept that.

17:55.641 --> 17:58.109
Then I think you should see
Katherine Lenz.

17:58.210 --> 18:00.075
Okay. Fine.

18:00.179 --> 18:02.977
That's what I'm talking about.
Katherine Lenz, okay.

18:03.082 --> 18:05.744
- Is that the brain specialist?
- No.

18:05.851 --> 18:07.716
She's your HMO administrator.

18:09.588 --> 18:11.954
Let me just save you some time here,
Miss Byrd.

18:12.057 --> 18:13.991
We won't cover you for this operation.

18:14.093 --> 18:15.651
Well, what do you mean,
you won't cover me?

18:15.761 --> 18:17.661
I'm covered through my HMO.

18:17.763 --> 18:21.722
If you feel you're being treated unfairly,
these are our appeals procedures...

18:21.834 --> 18:24.302
which you have every legal right
to pursue.

18:30.042 --> 18:34.706
Well, what if I pay for it myself?
How much would that cost me?

18:47.793 --> 18:50.353
The cost
of a median cranial debulking surgery...

18:50.462 --> 18:53.226
is around $340,000.

18:53.732 --> 18:55.427
That's without anesthesia.

18:56.435 --> 18:57.732
You'll want that.

18:59.705 --> 19:01.366
Check again,
make sure I'm not covered.

19:27.266 --> 19:30.201
You wait and you wait
for something big to happen...

19:32.604 --> 19:34.936
and then you find out you're gonna die.

19:49.087 --> 19:51.021
I really wanted to meet you.

19:53.759 --> 19:55.420
And I should've ate that.

19:57.329 --> 19:59.297
I should've ate all that stuff.

20:00.265 --> 20:01.596
Especially this.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.060
Put my foot in that. Darius loved that.

20:07.339 --> 20:09.432
Now I'll never get to Karlovy Vary.

20:12.010 --> 20:13.375
Chef Didier.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.686
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hi.

20:30.796 --> 20:33.890
Hiya, sis!
I was just getting ready to call you.

20:33.999 --> 20:36.331
You know, there's this guy
that I met in this club...

20:36.435 --> 20:39.427
<i>and he said he's gonna introduce me</i>
<i>to some of his friends in Nashville...</i>

20:39.538 --> 20:42.598
I just need you
to take care of the kids for three days.

20:43.875 --> 20:45.240
What you gonna do in Nashville?

20:45.344 --> 20:49.405
Girl, I am finally going to be
a country western singer.

20:50.816 --> 20:52.147
<i>Isn't that great?</i>

20:52.251 --> 20:55.516
Tanya, ain't no such thing
as a black country singer.

20:55.621 --> 20:59.284
<i>You know, I am not asking you to</i>
<i>comment on the validity of my dreams.</i>

20:59.391 --> 21:03.418
Now can you...
Hold on. Anton, would you stop it?

21:03.528 --> 21:06.725
- <i>This child is going to kill himself!</i>
- Listen, that's why I'm calling you...

21:06.832 --> 21:09.596
What are you doing? Why can't you
watch the kids? What are you...

21:10.002 --> 21:11.663
- <i>I'm gonna have to call you back.</i>
- But, I'm...

21:11.770 --> 21:15.001
<i>I told you to stop jumping.</i>
<i>Do it again and see what happens.</i>

21:15.107 --> 21:16.665
<i>You think I'm playing?</i>

21:19.645 --> 21:23.376
Georgia, where have you been?
Adamian's been looking for you.

21:23.482 --> 21:24.949
Good, 'cause I'm looking for him, too.

21:25.050 --> 21:26.881
- Why?
- I'm gonna take your advice.

21:26.985 --> 21:27.952
Huh?

21:28.053 --> 21:31.113
Look, remember when you said
life was too short to live the way I do?

21:31.223 --> 21:34.283
- Oh, I say a lot of things.
- Yeah, well, you were right.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.422
What? What did I say?
What are you gonna do?

21:38.964 --> 21:39.953
Georgia?

21:43.302 --> 21:44.792
What did I say?

21:52.277 --> 21:53.437
You don't knock?

21:53.545 --> 21:56.139
You better have a hell of an excuse
for where you've been, Ms. Byrd.

21:56.248 --> 21:57.545
I do, I do.

21:58.684 --> 22:00.584
You see, Mr. Adamian...

22:01.253 --> 22:04.017
Excuse me, would you mind?
This is very important.

22:04.122 --> 22:08.115
- Actually, it's a matter of life and...
- What?

22:08.794 --> 22:10.125
Just turn it off.

22:13.198 --> 22:14.256
Yeah.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.427
You're killing me
with the potato peelers.

22:17.536 --> 22:20.061
Move them
or I'll shove them down your throat.

22:24.776 --> 22:26.141
You got a problem?

22:27.279 --> 22:28.644
Yes, I do.

22:35.887 --> 22:37.377
That's a $400 phone.

22:44.796 --> 22:46.127
Now I feel better.

22:47.799 --> 22:49.198
That's company property.

22:49.301 --> 22:50.928
That's going to come out
of your paycheck.

22:51.036 --> 22:54.301
Take it. Take the whole thing, okay?
It's worth it.

22:54.406 --> 22:57.967
This is not about you, okay?
It's not about me.

22:58.076 --> 22:59.270
It's about business.

22:59.378 --> 23:01.437
- It's about the company.
- Mr. Adamian.

23:01.546 --> 23:04.538
I want you to hear this.
This man lives his philosophy.

23:06.518 --> 23:10.249
<i>Rule One:</i>
<i>Life is not a popularity contest...</i>

23:10.355 --> 23:12.346
<i>but it is a contest.</i>

23:12.457 --> 23:14.687
<i>Boo</i>- <i>hoo, they don't like me.</i>

23:14.793 --> 23:18.092
<i>Rule Two: You grab</i>
<i>that scared little loser inside you...</i>

23:18.196 --> 23:20.061
<i>and beat the living crap out of him!</i>

23:20.165 --> 23:24.033
<i>Rule three: When is enough, enough?</i>
<i>Enough is never enough.</i>

23:27.806 --> 23:30.502
Enough is enough right now,
Mr. Adamian!

23:30.609 --> 23:32.304
I'm trying to talk to you!

23:32.944 --> 23:35.344
I'm trying to tell you what's...

23:36.448 --> 23:39.474
Why am I even wasting my time
trying to talk to you?

23:39.584 --> 23:41.575
You know what? I quit.

23:41.686 --> 23:43.415
- You what?
- I quit.

23:43.522 --> 23:46.184
- You can't.
- Why can't I?

23:46.291 --> 23:48.555
Fourth quarter sales are in the toilet
in this store...

23:48.660 --> 23:50.594
and all the other stores, too,
for that matter.

23:50.695 --> 23:53.061
Your department has
the highest profit record in the place.

23:53.165 --> 23:55.156
I just... I can't afford to lose you.

23:56.468 --> 23:58.527
How come
you never told me this before?

23:58.637 --> 24:00.969
I didn't want you to do
what you're doing right now.

24:01.072 --> 24:02.334
Holding me up for more money.

24:02.441 --> 24:05.842
Which I'm happy to pay.
As God is my witness.

24:05.944 --> 24:09.471
As God is your witness, huh?
As God is your witness?

24:12.050 --> 24:15.281
All right. I'm prepared to offer you
50 cents more an hour!

24:16.221 --> 24:18.985
75 cents more an hour. 75.

24:21.827 --> 24:26.730
<i>Ms. Byrd, $1 more an hour. $1.50.</i>

24:31.169 --> 24:34.161
Hey, Georgia. Your shift done already?

24:35.807 --> 24:37.570
Yeah, I'm done.

24:38.009 --> 24:40.705
Listen, I feel terrible
about what happened the other day.

24:40.812 --> 24:43.872
- I wanted to make it up to you.
- It wasn't your fault.

24:45.550 --> 24:46.539
Well, anyway...

24:46.651 --> 24:50.348
Hey, I have a pair of tickets
to the Hornets game.

24:50.722 --> 24:52.849
Now, the game
is a couple of weeks away...

24:52.958 --> 24:56.485
but I know you're a busy woman,
so I wanted to put my bid in early.

24:56.595 --> 25:00.964
Sean, there is nothing I would rather do
than to go to that game with you.

25:01.066 --> 25:02.590
Yeah? That's great.

25:03.768 --> 25:07.329
Well, look, I figured we'll go
to dinner early, then after the game...

25:07.439 --> 25:08.770
I can't go, Sean.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.733
I mean, it's not like I don't want to. I...

25:15.213 --> 25:16.407
I can't.

25:19.050 --> 25:20.950
You have to be somewhere else.

25:22.254 --> 25:23.312
Yeah.

25:26.424 --> 25:28.415
Hey, well, Georgia. Georgia!

25:29.060 --> 25:30.084
Look.

25:30.996 --> 25:33.123
I already paid for the ticket, so...

25:35.901 --> 25:37.994
maybe your plans might change, huh?

25:51.850 --> 25:53.681
Brothers and Sisters...

25:54.352 --> 25:56.217
I'm sad to announce that...

25:56.321 --> 26:00.621
Senator Dillings will not be gracing
our flock this morning as planned.

26:00.725 --> 26:03.751
Pressing business
in our nation's capital has kept him.

26:03.862 --> 26:08.162
But I'd like to take a moment of prayer
for the Senator.

26:08.934 --> 26:12.836
He toils so hard
toting the burden of our welfare.

26:13.171 --> 26:17.130
And I ask the good Lord
to guide his hand...

26:17.642 --> 26:20.907
in his important good works. Amen.

26:21.012 --> 26:22.775
- Amen.
- Amen.

26:24.983 --> 26:26.348
Oh, why me?

26:29.487 --> 26:32.422
- Oh, dear Lord, why me?
- Georgia?

26:32.524 --> 26:34.151
Why me, Lord? Why me, Lord?

26:34.259 --> 26:37.695
- Oh, dear Lord! Lord, why me?
- Bless the Lord.

26:37.796 --> 26:40.026
Oh, Lord, no!

26:40.131 --> 26:43.328
Oh, no, no.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.765
Lord! Lord, come on!

26:47.539 --> 26:49.370
Come on, Lord, why?

26:51.910 --> 26:53.844
I don't understand!

26:54.746 --> 26:57.340
<i>I followed your Commandments, Lord</i>

26:57.449 --> 26:59.349
<i>I followed your Commandments, Lord</i>

26:59.451 --> 27:01.043
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

27:01.152 --> 27:03.245
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

27:03.355 --> 27:06.586
<i>I never slept around</i>
<i>even though my sister did!</i>

27:07.525 --> 27:09.356
<i>Why in heavens me, Lord?</i>

27:09.461 --> 27:11.156
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

27:11.262 --> 27:14.595
<i>I never cussed my boss</i>
<i>or nothing like that!</i>

27:14.699 --> 27:16.633
<i>Why in heavens me, Lord?</i>

27:16.735 --> 27:18.293
<i>Why in heavens me?</i>

27:18.403 --> 27:20.030
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

27:20.138 --> 27:21.435
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

27:21.539 --> 27:22.836
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

27:22.941 --> 27:24.033
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

27:24.142 --> 27:25.541
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

27:25.644 --> 27:29.705
<i>Come on, now, somebody tell me why!</i>

27:30.582 --> 27:31.981
- <i>Why?</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

27:32.083 --> 27:33.050
<i>Why, Lord?</i>

27:33.151 --> 27:34.118
<i>Why, Lord?</i>

27:34.219 --> 27:35.208
- <i>Why, please?</i>
- <i>Why?</i>

27:35.320 --> 27:36.287
<i>I got to know</i>

27:36.388 --> 27:38.253
<i>I got to know, God!</i>

27:38.356 --> 27:39.687
<i>Why me?</i>

27:41.493 --> 27:44.587
<i>Why? Oh, why?</i>

27:44.896 --> 27:48.388
<i>Why, Lord? Why? Oh, come on</i>

27:50.502 --> 27:54.495
<i>Why? Why? Why?</i>

27:55.540 --> 27:59.067
<i>Why? Why? Why?</i>

28:55.033 --> 28:58.969
You're sure you want to liquidate
the entire IRA? All of it?

28:59.070 --> 29:01.061
Yeah, and the bonds my mama left me.

29:01.172 --> 29:04.505
Well, I'm sure a disciplined woman
such as yourself...

29:04.609 --> 29:07.544
has a very useful purpose
for this money.

29:11.649 --> 29:12.741
Yes, I do.

29:14.385 --> 29:15.943
I'm just gonna blow it.

29:18.823 --> 29:20.723
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we want to thank you...</i>

29:20.825 --> 29:22.520
<i>for flying with us on Christmas Day.</i>

29:22.627 --> 29:25.755
<i>We're going to make your trip</i>
<i>as comforyable as possible.</i>

29:28.366 --> 29:29.799
Stewardess...

29:30.168 --> 29:33.001
this person behind me
is giving me a hard time.

29:33.104 --> 29:34.662
Okay, sure, sir.

29:34.773 --> 29:37.537
Ma'am, would you mind
lowering your knees...

29:37.642 --> 29:40.873
so the gentleman in front of you
can put his seat back down?

29:43.114 --> 29:45.514
Actually, I very much would mind.

29:46.317 --> 29:48.945
Am I going to have to
call the Air Marshal, ma'am?

29:49.053 --> 29:51.385
People been calling me ma'am
a lot lately...

29:51.489 --> 29:53.855
and, you know,
I'm hardly older than you.

29:53.958 --> 29:55.152
Do people call you ma'am?

29:55.260 --> 29:57.820
No... No, they don't.

29:58.730 --> 30:00.664
Is there a problem here?

30:10.241 --> 30:13.267
Yes. Yes, there is.

30:13.945 --> 30:16.038
I'm gonna tell you what the problem is.

30:16.481 --> 30:19.939
This greedy airline put all these seats
so close together...

30:20.051 --> 30:21.643
just so they can make more money.

30:21.753 --> 30:23.516
- Makes sense.
- Yeah.

30:23.655 --> 30:24.952
All right?

30:25.089 --> 30:27.250
Now, I'm not flying
all the way to Prague...

30:27.358 --> 30:29.189
with some stranger in my lap.

30:29.694 --> 30:31.218
I know that's right.

30:31.329 --> 30:34.628
That's a big boy.
That's a big old man right there.

30:34.732 --> 30:35.994
I can't... Look at him.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.864
Had you chosen to fly first class...

30:41.639 --> 30:43.732
Ma'am? Hi.

30:44.142 --> 30:46.804
Had you chosen to fly first class
instead of economy...

30:46.911 --> 30:49.436
you would have had plenty of room
in one of our cocoons.

30:49.547 --> 30:51.708
- How much is it?
- Beg your pardon?

30:51.816 --> 30:53.977
How much for the damn cocoon?

30:54.085 --> 30:55.347
- Work it!
- I like that.

30:55.453 --> 30:57.011
- All right.
- Hear, hear.

31:01.559 --> 31:05.051
For our first class clients
flying with us during the holidays...

31:05.163 --> 31:07.495
we thought we would do
something special.

31:21.746 --> 31:25.011
Thank you. Wait, don't go.
Just leave that right here.

31:38.630 --> 31:40.495
Look at that taxi line.

31:41.499 --> 31:43.763
Oh, this is gonna take forever.

32:30.682 --> 32:34.243
That's it. That's the Pupp.
That's the hotel I'm going to.

32:46.497 --> 32:47.657
Who is that?

32:50.301 --> 32:52.929
- What's going on?
- I'm not sure, Congressman.

32:53.438 --> 32:54.803
Who is that?

32:55.340 --> 32:59.003
All I know, Senator, is that the last time
someone arrived by helicopter...

32:59.110 --> 33:01.738
it was Elton John. Sir Elton John.

33:02.113 --> 33:03.137
Wow.

33:16.627 --> 33:18.618
Hello. Welcome!

33:18.730 --> 33:20.459
- Thank you.
- Welcoming.

33:21.399 --> 33:25.267
- You are here for retreat of the health?
- I guess you could say that.

33:26.004 --> 33:27.369
How are you?

33:27.538 --> 33:30.439
Well I'm hung-over, I'm jet-lagged.
I'm dying.

33:30.541 --> 33:33.601
- Other than that, I'm fine, thank you.
- Great, great.

33:38.683 --> 33:41.516
Oh, you are from Louisiana?

33:41.686 --> 33:44.484
Your Senator Dillings, he here now.
Skiing.

33:45.023 --> 33:47.685
- Senator Dillings is here skiing?
- Yes.

33:47.792 --> 33:50.818
Well, that explains why he didn't make it
to our meeting on Sunday.

33:50.928 --> 33:53.590
- Please, I'll meet you at reception desk.
- Okay.

33:58.002 --> 34:00.197
And here I was thinking I might not fit in.

34:20.123 --> 34:23.355
- Excuse me. Georgia Byrd.
- <i>Madame</i> Byrd?

34:25.263 --> 34:27.322
Welcome to Grandhotel Pupp.

34:27.697 --> 34:29.928
Come on. Y'all really say it like that?

34:30.034 --> 34:31.433
- Pupp.
- Pupp.

34:31.536 --> 34:32.900
- Pupp.
- Pupp.

34:33.304 --> 34:35.737
I'm sorry, Miss Byrd,
but your room is not ready yet.

34:35.840 --> 34:38.308
We weren't expecting you
for two more hours.

34:38.409 --> 34:41.071
Well, I wasn't expecting
to take a helicopter.

34:41.545 --> 34:44.036
But my time is kind of precious
lately now.

34:44.148 --> 34:45.877
Don't y'all have anything available now?

34:45.983 --> 34:47.449
I'll check it.

35:01.065 --> 35:03.829
Don't that ceiling ever just
make you want to cry?

35:04.235 --> 35:06.226
I've never noticed, madam.

35:07.138 --> 35:09.231
Only the presidential suite.

35:10.074 --> 35:13.134
It's C3,000 a night.

35:14.011 --> 35:16.479
About $4,000 a night.

35:18.549 --> 35:20.312
Did you see me blink?

35:22.153 --> 35:23.882
Madam Byrd, welcome.

35:23.988 --> 35:26.991
I know that you will find our
presidential suite most comfortable.

35:27.258 --> 35:30.625
- Mr. Kragen, would you sign my book?
- Yes.

35:32.396 --> 35:35.456
- Matthew Kragen.
- You know Mr. Kragen?

35:35.700 --> 35:39.534
We are so honored that he comes
to our hotel every year at this time.

35:42.406 --> 35:45.102
- You playing with me, right?
- Pardon me?

35:45.409 --> 35:47.900
- Oh, not you, Him.
- Excuse me.

35:48.112 --> 35:49.704
Is the spelling okay?

35:50.948 --> 35:52.848
You get yourself
young, hip and rich, okay?

35:52.950 --> 35:54.508
- Thank you.
- Mr. Kragen, sir.

35:54.619 --> 35:57.144
- I hope everything's okay.
- Wonderful, Arturo, wonderful.

35:57.255 --> 36:00.850
- And will Mrs. Kragen be joining us?
- Well, not this trip, Arturo.

36:00.958 --> 36:02.425
This is strictly business.

36:02.527 --> 36:06.019
As always, if there's anything,
even the slightest thing, you will tell me.

36:06.130 --> 36:09.258
- Well, I won't, but she will.
- Lf I need you, I'll call you.

36:09.367 --> 36:10.664
Excellent.

36:11.602 --> 36:13.365
Can you believe that?

36:17.141 --> 36:19.939
Don't worry about it. Now, listen,
just double-check everything...

36:20.044 --> 36:22.512
and I want to keep tabs
on the Congressman and the Senator.

36:22.613 --> 36:26.208
Schmooze, impress, whatever it takes.
This deal's got to happen.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.813
Madam Byrd.
Felipe will show you to your suite.

36:29.921 --> 36:30.979
Okay.

36:32.423 --> 36:34.789
Matthew, Miss Burns.

36:35.126 --> 36:38.653
The Senator's gone skiing
for the 83rd time. Let's go have a drink.

36:40.097 --> 36:42.622
Get upstairs and put some silk on.

36:43.134 --> 36:44.499
Congressman!

36:49.006 --> 36:52.498
If it's any consolation,
he's gonna have a shitty fourth quarter.

36:55.313 --> 36:56.678
Who is that?

36:56.981 --> 37:01.281
Oh, <i>Mademoiselle</i> Byrd. Very rich.
From Louisiana.

37:02.587 --> 37:04.953
She and Senator Dillings
were supposed to have...

37:05.056 --> 37:07.183
a very important meeting together.

37:10.962 --> 37:14.693
Hang on, let me give you a little
something for your troubles.

37:14.799 --> 37:17.597
I haven't quite figured out
this money yet.

37:18.202 --> 37:21.069
Did I just give you
a ridiculously large tip?

37:22.340 --> 37:23.671
No, madam.

37:24.742 --> 37:26.676
Now, more reasonable.

37:30.615 --> 37:32.674
- Bye-bye.
- Bye!

37:44.528 --> 37:46.587
What world was I living in?

37:54.672 --> 37:57.698
Make me international.

37:59.877 --> 38:01.344
We could try.

38:28.873 --> 38:30.465
Give me my money.

38:31.676 --> 38:33.303
I can't wear this.

38:33.544 --> 38:36.638
Oh, yeah, there we go. Like that.

38:54.532 --> 38:57.262
You think anybody'd call me ma'am
in this outfit?

38:57.668 --> 38:59.499
- No.
- Definitely not.

39:13.217 --> 39:16.448
- Table for one, please.
- Yes, <i>mademoiselle.</i>

39:17.355 --> 39:18.515
Please.

39:29.066 --> 39:31.034
May I take your pashmina?

39:31.836 --> 39:34.134
Oh, is that what this thing is?

39:36.107 --> 39:37.165
Sure.

39:38.542 --> 39:40.271
Hello, sister.

39:43.981 --> 39:45.710
Who the hell is she?

39:46.117 --> 39:48.085
- <i>Mademoiselle.</i>
- Thank you.

39:59.630 --> 40:01.427
Her name is Georgia Byrd.

40:01.532 --> 40:05.263
She's loaded and she's an old crony
of Dillings from Louisiana.

40:07.471 --> 40:08.438
I...

40:08.606 --> 40:09.937
I'm sorry.

40:11.475 --> 40:13.136
No. It's okay, it's okay.

40:13.844 --> 40:15.744
Water. Flat. No ice.

40:16.046 --> 40:17.638
- Please, serve everyone.
- Of course.

40:17.748 --> 40:20.273
Matthew, what are the chances
of our meeting Chef Didier?

40:20.384 --> 40:23.046
Margaret here's got a couple
of his books. She's a big fan.

40:23.154 --> 40:25.088
Is that right? Arturo!

40:25.523 --> 40:26.751
Yes, sir.

40:29.560 --> 40:32.688
Make sure Didier comes and says hello
to the table.

40:32.797 --> 40:34.697
And fire that guy.

40:42.406 --> 40:46.103
For the specialties <i>de maison,</i>
we have the cassoulet.

40:46.710 --> 40:49.406
We have risotto Barolo with truffles.

40:49.814 --> 40:53.250
The rouget citrus <i>beurre blanc</i>
with capers.

40:53.951 --> 40:56.476
Roast quail with brioche stuffing.

40:57.121 --> 41:01.820
And a braised lamb shank
with blood orange relish.

41:02.259 --> 41:04.352
Blood orange relish.

41:05.229 --> 41:06.992
Now, that all sounds so good.

41:07.097 --> 41:08.758
Will he have the same specials
tomorrow night?

41:08.866 --> 41:12.233
No. Chef Didier never creates
the same menu twice.

41:13.237 --> 41:15.967
Well, I guess I better try them all
tonight then.

41:17.274 --> 41:19.708
<i>Tout?</i> All?

41:20.578 --> 41:23.240
<i>Tout,</i> baby! <i>Tout de suite.</i>

41:23.614 --> 41:26.378
Do you think he would do a risotto
without the dairy?

41:26.484 --> 41:29.510
I think I'm going to have
the rouget citrus without the potatoes...

41:29.620 --> 41:31.144
and the <i>blanc</i> without the <i>beurre.</i>

41:39.663 --> 41:43.326
No butter, no cream, no wheat,
no dairy, no fat!

41:43.534 --> 41:45.900
<i>Merde!</i> Why do they bother to eat?

41:46.003 --> 41:48.301
Next time, stick this in my neck!

42:04.321 --> 42:05.788
And no substitutions?

42:20.304 --> 42:22.033
I will do it myself.

42:23.507 --> 42:26.772
She has got them eating
right out of her hand.

42:28.045 --> 42:30.775
Well, she's sure not watching
her cholesterol.

42:30.948 --> 42:33.382
I wish I could command
attention like that.

42:35.486 --> 42:36.953
Is that the lamb?

42:37.154 --> 42:40.248
- <i>Mademoiselle.</i>
- Oh, look at that!

42:43.294 --> 42:47.287
Looks so good!
Everything looks so good.

42:54.171 --> 42:55.536
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

42:57.441 --> 42:58.806
<i>Bon appétit.</i>

43:00.611 --> 43:01.669
Amen.

43:02.046 --> 43:05.846
I was thinking maybe we could get Bob
up to speed tomorrow at lunchtime.

43:05.950 --> 43:08.350
Yes, Matthew. I'd like to know more
about this merger.

43:08.452 --> 43:09.612
Here he is!

43:14.124 --> 43:16.718
How do you find everything,
<i>mademoiselle?</i>

43:16.827 --> 43:18.624
- Arturo.
- Yes, sir.

43:19.430 --> 43:21.159
I think he'll be by.

43:23.133 --> 43:25.294
I'm sure he'll be right over, sir.

43:26.136 --> 43:29.572
- I'll be up there, on top of the mountain.
- Okay. Will Margaret join us?

43:29.673 --> 43:31.231
Because we do need to talk
some business.

43:31.342 --> 43:32.900
Okay, what time?

43:33.477 --> 43:35.536
Depends on Kragen's schedule.

43:35.646 --> 43:37.580
You know, where I come from...

43:37.748 --> 43:41.115
we do a barbecue quail
with an andouille pudding.

43:41.485 --> 43:43.749
I think you would just love it.

43:44.855 --> 43:47.119
And, you know, call me crazy...

43:47.224 --> 43:50.091
but am I tasting rendered lards
of pork belly here?

43:50.194 --> 43:51.218
<i>Oui?</i>

43:51.528 --> 43:52.859
Pork belly?

43:54.264 --> 43:55.390
Oink, oink.

43:56.266 --> 43:57.961
Very sensitive palate.

43:58.068 --> 44:02.027
Half clarified butter and half pork fat.

44:02.139 --> 44:05.233
- I knew it.
- No? But you keep it to yourself.

44:05.909 --> 44:09.675
You know how some people are
about pork's fat.

44:10.447 --> 44:11.414
Yeah.

44:12.983 --> 44:15.110
They don't like the pork...

44:22.226 --> 44:24.217
Chef Didier, you're crazy!

44:27.931 --> 44:31.389
Matthew, you seem to know everybody.
Who is she?

44:31.669 --> 44:34.069
I was gonna ask the Senator
the same question.

44:34.438 --> 44:37.339
- I don't know her.
- Really? You sure about that?

44:37.441 --> 44:40.376
Well, for your information,
I don't know everyone who's black.

44:41.078 --> 44:43.774
Well, apparently she knows you
from New Orleans?

44:43.881 --> 44:48.284
Really? Maybe it was last year's
Entrepreneurs of Diversity.

44:48.619 --> 44:51.417
Well, whoever she is, I'd sure like
to have her ordering 10 plates...

44:51.522 --> 44:53.820
at a $10,000-a-plate fundraiser.

44:54.191 --> 44:56.557
Why, Bob?
Haven't I've been contributing enough?

44:56.660 --> 44:58.252
No, Matthew, I didn't mean it that way.

44:58.362 --> 45:01.024
You've been very generous
and it's much appreciated.

45:11.975 --> 45:13.272
Dr. Gupta.

45:16.447 --> 45:17.778
Dr. Gupta.

45:20.217 --> 45:23.914
Sir, if this is a medical question,
I'm still on my break...

45:25.723 --> 45:27.384
for two and a half more minutes.

45:27.491 --> 45:30.426
Well, actually, excuse me,
it's not about me.

45:30.527 --> 45:33.553
It's about Georgia Byrd.
Remember the lady who hit her head?

45:33.664 --> 45:37.191
Sir, why do you think
I'm so desperately trying to relax?

45:37.367 --> 45:39.597
Well, she's been acting
really strange lately.

45:39.703 --> 45:41.933
She up and quit her job.
Nobody's seen her.

45:42.039 --> 45:45.531
And I was wondering if you had said
anything that might have upset her?

45:45.642 --> 45:47.769
- Or if you know something...
- I'm sorry.

45:47.878 --> 45:51.177
Patient privacy prevents me
from commenting, I'm very sorry...

45:51.582 --> 45:53.982
- You're gonna tell me!
- Okay, okay.

45:54.151 --> 45:56.551
- Sir?
- Tell me!

45:56.987 --> 45:59.182
Georgia Byrd is going to die.

45:59.523 --> 46:01.115
- What?
- I'm very sorry.

46:01.225 --> 46:03.318
- What?
- I'm very sorry, sir.

46:04.228 --> 46:05.889
No, this can't be.

46:06.797 --> 46:09.960
My break is over. We can talk about it.
Come, put me down.

46:19.409 --> 46:20.740
That's nice.

46:53.377 --> 46:55.004
I do it with love.

47:00.184 --> 47:01.242
Okay.

47:13.363 --> 47:16.730
And the gonging, flushing
negative energy.

47:20.904 --> 47:24.396
Wait. I gotta use the bathroom.

47:37.254 --> 47:39.848
They say these waters
have curative powers...

47:40.224 --> 47:41.987
let you live to be 100.

47:42.693 --> 47:45.059
Yeah, well, I hope they work fast.

47:46.129 --> 47:50.088
Clarence Dillings.
Senator Clarence Dillings.

47:50.634 --> 47:53.831
- I know who you are.
- Oh, so, we have met.

47:54.271 --> 47:56.296
Entrepreneurs of Diversity?

47:56.607 --> 47:59.132
- No, afraid not.
- Washington?

48:07.551 --> 48:09.246
They do know each other.

48:09.753 --> 48:10.811
Well.

48:15.893 --> 48:17.053
Church?

48:18.428 --> 48:21.761
- But I didn't go to church last Sunday.
- That's right.

48:22.766 --> 48:26.258
You know, you left a whole lot
of church folk disappointed, Senator.

48:26.370 --> 48:28.338
People who voted for you.

48:31.241 --> 48:34.301
I hope you'll communicate
my sincerest regrets.

48:36.079 --> 48:38.377
I don't wanna have nothing
to do with your regrets.

48:38.482 --> 48:40.450
I got my hands full of my own.

48:41.518 --> 48:44.248
I got a gut feeling about that woman.
She's trouble.

48:44.354 --> 48:47.414
You know, Matthew,
who was it who said:

48:47.524 --> 48:50.982
"Adversity is the stone
on which I sharpen my blade"?

48:51.295 --> 48:52.284
Me.

49:04.107 --> 49:05.404
Excuse me.

49:09.780 --> 49:13.375
Ms. Byrd, is it?
We've not been introduced.

49:14.718 --> 49:16.151
- My name...
- There's no need.

49:16.253 --> 49:18.221
Everybody knows Matthew Kragen.

49:18.355 --> 49:22.086
The man for whom
"enough is never enough."

49:31.635 --> 49:33.102
I mean, who is she?

49:33.303 --> 49:34.827
How do I know she's not part of some...

49:34.938 --> 49:36.667
consumer watchdog group
or something?

49:36.773 --> 49:38.434
Well, it's not like there's some law...

49:38.542 --> 49:41.534
against being at the same hotel
with a congressman and a senator.

49:41.645 --> 49:44.113
Actually, there is,
if they're on my plane and my dime.

49:44.214 --> 49:48.913
Well, watchdogs don't stay
in $4,000-a-night hotel suites, okay?

49:49.987 --> 49:52.717
So, how about you and I
just forget all about...

49:52.856 --> 49:55.154
retail empire building...

49:55.359 --> 49:58.351
and let's just take a little bath? Yeah?

49:59.529 --> 50:00.587
I'll take a bath, all right.

50:00.697 --> 50:03.291
A $500-million bath
if these mergers don't go through.

50:03.400 --> 50:06.494
You just keep your eyes open
and remember why we're here.

50:17.748 --> 50:19.978
Are you all right, Madam Byrd?

50:21.485 --> 50:25.444
Yeah. I just... I just love these sheets.

50:25.822 --> 50:29.622
I love them. I was just taking them
for a little ride around the block.

50:29.826 --> 50:32.294
I am Gunther. Floor valet.

50:32.796 --> 50:36.027
Oh, that was you
that put my clothes away.

50:36.366 --> 50:38.334
- Yeah.
- Okay.

50:38.969 --> 50:42.405
Well, Miss Gunther,
what do you do for fun around here?

50:42.773 --> 50:44.866
What do I do for fun, madam?

50:45.776 --> 50:49.234
I shine the guests' shoes
when they leave them out in the hall.

50:51.715 --> 50:53.148
If that will be all.

50:53.984 --> 50:56.885
No, actually, that won't, Miss Gunther.

50:58.055 --> 51:00.615
I'm gonna be wanting to have
one of these snowboarding lessons.

51:00.724 --> 51:04.387
- Very good. Will that be all?
- No, no.

51:04.861 --> 51:06.294
No, it won't.

51:06.963 --> 51:10.364
I want some more
of these spa services. Like maybe...

51:11.868 --> 51:16.464
Maybe this algae flotation wrap
and the reflexology massage.

51:16.940 --> 51:19.272
No anti-aging treatment?

51:21.511 --> 51:24.878
- No, I ain't worried about aging.
- So, that will be all?

51:27.617 --> 51:30.882
Yes! The colon irrigation treatment.

51:31.621 --> 51:35.853
That's my gift to you.
Sort of like a "let's be friends" gesture.

51:37.727 --> 51:40.161
Now, you think of me
when you're having it!

51:43.033 --> 51:44.022
Oh.

51:50.507 --> 51:52.737
I've been waiting my whole life
to do something like this.

51:52.843 --> 51:54.470
- All right then, let's go.
- Okay.

51:54.578 --> 51:56.603
- Just lean forward. Lean forward.
- Lean forward.

51:56.713 --> 51:59.546
Left leg, that's it. And go!

51:59.649 --> 52:04.416
Go, that's it. Just go! Yeah!
You got it, lean forward! Balance!

52:04.688 --> 52:06.656
Yeah! That's it. Lean...

52:08.592 --> 52:09.923
Are you all right?

52:11.061 --> 52:12.028
Let's go.

52:12.996 --> 52:14.588
- Let's turn.
- Oh, man.

52:14.698 --> 52:16.427
- You feel the rhythm?
- I feel the rhythm.

52:16.533 --> 52:18.228
- Yeah. Feel the rhythm.
- That's good.

52:18.335 --> 52:20.462
- That's it. Right. You got it?
- I think I got it.

52:20.570 --> 52:23.368
So, go! Just lean forward.
Lean forward and go!

52:23.473 --> 52:26.704
Lean forward. Lean forward.
Lean forward.

52:26.877 --> 52:28.674
- Lean forward.
- Yeah, that's it, that's great.

52:28.778 --> 52:31.246
- Oh, Lord.
- That's great. No, no, no.

52:32.315 --> 52:35.773
Slow down. Slow down a bit.
No. Slow down!

52:36.052 --> 52:39.988
Turn the board sideways!
Slow, slow down!

52:42.692 --> 52:43.750
Stop!

52:50.700 --> 52:54.727
<i>Scusi!</i> Watch out!
Get out of my way! Watch it!

53:03.079 --> 53:04.137
What?

53:10.554 --> 53:11.782
It's steep here, Matthew.

53:11.888 --> 53:14.322
Hey, Matthew, this is
a Black Diamond run.

53:14.424 --> 53:15.982
Yeah, you're looking good.

53:18.728 --> 53:18.895
- Look at her go!
- Matthew?

53:18.895 --> 53:21.329
- Look at her go!
- Matthew?

53:23.333 --> 53:24.459
Matthew!

53:44.020 --> 53:46.318
- Enjoying yourself?
- Not really.

53:46.423 --> 53:47.515
Please, don't do that.

53:47.624 --> 53:49.251
I guess you don't believe in turning?

53:49.359 --> 53:52.419
I believe in it,
I just don't know how to do...

53:53.096 --> 53:54.927
Oh, hold me, hold me! Please!

53:57.934 --> 54:01.267
- Please get off of my skis!
- Okay, I think I've got it.

54:01.371 --> 54:02.395
Let me go.

54:03.106 --> 54:06.667
Sorry. I'm okay! I'm okay!

54:06.776 --> 54:08.004
Damn you!

54:08.245 --> 54:11.442
Nobody makes me do a face-plant!
Damn it!

54:11.548 --> 54:13.413
Watch your mouth!

54:18.054 --> 54:20.579
What the hell are you doing?
You trying to kill me?

54:20.690 --> 54:21.987
Watch out!

54:31.334 --> 54:33.165
Get over here, you!

54:34.971 --> 54:37.769
They should get you off this mountain!
You figure...

55:01.731 --> 55:04.256
You... You ski like that...

55:04.634 --> 55:07.000
you're gonna be in court
for the next two years!

55:07.103 --> 55:09.128
That's fine with me, baby.

55:14.744 --> 55:16.075
Oh, my God.

55:24.020 --> 55:26.648
And we are going to leave you now...

55:26.990 --> 55:30.187
- to relax and meditate.
- Thank you.

55:35.131 --> 55:36.428
Why, Lord?

55:38.101 --> 55:39.830
I don't want to die.

55:41.271 --> 55:42.761
I want to live.

55:49.112 --> 55:51.046
What are you trying to do to me, huh?

55:51.147 --> 55:53.138
You have big knot in neck.

55:53.583 --> 55:58.020
You do something at work where
you hold head in strange position.

55:58.121 --> 56:00.612
Excuse me? Are you suggesting that I...

56:00.724 --> 56:03.318
Too much holding phone
on neck, maybe.

56:04.494 --> 56:06.621
You know what?
Why don't you just shut up...

56:06.730 --> 56:09.255
and do what you're supposed to do,
okay?

56:09.366 --> 56:11.596
You're a masseuse, not a life coach!

56:11.701 --> 56:12.998
Excuse me.

56:21.644 --> 56:23.578
Hey. Hey!

56:25.815 --> 56:28.443
I don't like the way
you're talking to that woman.

56:28.885 --> 56:32.412
I'm sorry if I disturbed you, Ms. Byrd.
She was hurting me, though.

56:32.522 --> 56:36.014
I don't care. You don't talk
to working people that way.

56:36.359 --> 56:38.759
Now, it's plain to see
what the problem is here.

56:38.862 --> 56:41.831
You got tension in your neck 'cause
you keep going down on Mr. Kragen.

56:41.931 --> 56:43.330
And he's a married man.

56:43.433 --> 56:45.867
At least this poor lady
is trying to work it out of you.

56:45.969 --> 56:47.834
Don't take it out on Brigitta.

56:48.671 --> 56:49.763
Thank you.

56:52.776 --> 56:55.074
Anyway, enjoy your massage.

56:55.178 --> 56:57.476
- Thank you very much.
- Bye.

57:21.070 --> 57:24.039
Is it that obvious
that I'm sleeping with him?

57:29.846 --> 57:31.143
I knew it.

57:33.316 --> 57:36.513
None of the other women
at the company will even talk to me.

57:36.619 --> 57:38.348
I'm marked by this.

57:39.589 --> 57:43.116
And there's no one in my life
who I can talk to about it.

57:43.593 --> 57:47.188
Well, I wouldn't lose too much sleep
over what other people think.

57:47.864 --> 57:50.890
Now, come on, girl,
we're supposed to be meditating.

57:52.235 --> 57:54.703
I've been at the company six years.

57:55.371 --> 57:57.771
I've worked really hard, you know?

57:59.275 --> 58:02.244
Oh, you don't understand.
I hate the retail business.

58:02.345 --> 58:04.609
Oh, believe me, baby, I understand.

58:05.014 --> 58:07.949
I worked in the retail business
for 10 years myself.

58:10.587 --> 58:12.817
Look, I know this whole story.

58:13.690 --> 58:16.158
My sister was seeing a married man.

58:16.759 --> 58:18.488
Matthew's gonna leave his wife.

58:18.595 --> 58:21.758
It's a bad time for her right now,
but he is gonna leave his wife.

58:21.865 --> 58:25.460
Baby, come on, now.
I know you're holding out some hope...

58:26.236 --> 58:30.366
but come on, they're never bad people,
they're greedy people.

58:30.840 --> 58:33.832
They want a little bit of this,
little bit of that, little bit of that...

58:33.943 --> 58:35.433
They ain't leaving their wives.

58:35.545 --> 58:38.309
Yeah, you just need to leave him.

58:39.115 --> 58:42.846
It's not that easy.
If I leave him, I'll have to quit my job.

58:43.720 --> 58:46.018
What am I going to do?
I didn't finish school.

58:47.257 --> 58:49.623
Well, then you go back to school.

58:49.993 --> 58:52.052
There now, we solved it.

58:52.228 --> 58:54.890
Let's tackle something heavy,
like world hunger.

58:55.798 --> 58:58.858
Well, did you at least find out
what she's doing here?

58:59.002 --> 59:02.165
She's just here enjoying herself.
Unlike us.

59:02.272 --> 59:03.637
How can I enjoy myself?

59:03.740 --> 59:05.708
Dillings is suddenly telling me
that his committee...

59:05.808 --> 59:07.366
has problems with my acquisitions.

59:07.477 --> 59:10.173
Matthew, what does that
have to do with Georgia?

59:10.680 --> 59:14.116
Oh, Georgia, is it now?
Oh, well, why don't you tell me?

59:14.217 --> 59:17.914
I don't know, Matthew.
She said she worked in retail.

59:18.688 --> 59:20.952
Did I mention to you how she told me...

59:21.057 --> 59:23.287
you were gonna have
a shitty fourth quarter?

59:24.093 --> 59:26.084
How can she possibly know
about our fourth quarter?

59:26.195 --> 59:27.685
I barely know about our fourth quarter.

59:27.797 --> 59:30.664
Well, maybe she's an executive
for Wal-Mart.

59:30.767 --> 59:33.258
I mean, the competition
wouldn't want to see you...

59:33.369 --> 59:36.338
triple the size of your retail empire,
would they?

59:36.539 --> 59:39.167
You know what? That's it. That's it!

59:39.542 --> 59:43.205
She's here to drive a wedge
between me and those guys.

59:43.947 --> 59:46.814
If I don't have their support,
my bill is dead on the floor.

59:46.916 --> 59:51.444
That's what's gonna happen, see?
I need to relax, that's what I need to do.

59:52.488 --> 59:55.252
Oh, God, my blood pressure is...

59:55.725 --> 59:59.354
You know what?
I need to just do something to relax.

01:00:00.763 --> 01:00:03.163
- Come here...
- Take a cold plunge, Matthew.

01:00:03.666 --> 01:00:04.724
What?

01:00:09.706 --> 01:00:10.900
Georgia?

01:00:19.015 --> 01:00:22.246
- You guys seen Georgia?
- I ain't seen her in a while.

01:00:22.619 --> 01:00:23.608
No.

01:00:32.662 --> 01:00:35.062
Hey, what are you doing,
casing the place?

01:00:36.532 --> 01:00:39.524
- Where's Georgia?
- Hey, you're that guy.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:41.729
You're the Possibilities man.
The guy in the book.

01:00:41.838 --> 01:00:43.965
What? What book?
What are you talking about?

01:00:44.073 --> 01:00:45.438
- Where's Georgia?
- Hold on.

01:00:45.541 --> 01:00:47.372
- What?
- Hold on.

01:01:00.156 --> 01:01:02.090
Here, I found this in her garbage can.

01:01:02.191 --> 01:01:04.159
That's my employee of the month photo.

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:14.299
- Did she say anything about me?
- No.

01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:16.567
Why? You like her, right?

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:20.599
Easy, killer.
Did she say where she was going?

01:01:21.377 --> 01:01:23.845
A place with healing waters
or something.

01:01:23.946 --> 01:01:27.746
Look, it's really important that you
remember, all right, little man?

01:01:27.950 --> 01:01:30.111
Maybe it's in here somewhere.

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:32.921
I know she told me before she left.

01:01:33.656 --> 01:01:38.116
I think this is it.
Calamari Vary, I think the name is.

01:01:38.227 --> 01:01:41.196
- Karlovy Vary?
- Yeah, Karlovy Vary, that's it!

01:01:49.539 --> 01:01:51.166
- Oh, good evening, Georgia.
- Hi.

01:01:51.274 --> 01:01:52.707
- How are you this evening?
- Good, thanks.

01:01:52.809 --> 01:01:53.935
Why don't you join us?

01:01:54.043 --> 01:01:57.012
We got plenty of room at our table,
don't we, Matthew?

01:01:57.847 --> 01:02:01.305
- Sure, yeah, why not?
- No, please. Please, come join us.

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:04.011
- Yes, come, it's decided.
- Good evening, Ms. Byrd.

01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:08.386
Chef Didier has reserved a special table
for you. If you'd like to come with me.

01:02:08.658 --> 01:02:12.424
Well, thank you,
but why don't you join me?

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:14.359
It seems I have a special table.

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:21.336
- Thanks so much for having us.
- Oh, thank you. Thank you.

01:02:21.437 --> 01:02:23.200
You really look beautiful.

01:02:23.306 --> 01:02:24.898
- Yes, you do.
- Thank you.

01:02:25.007 --> 01:02:26.804
- You really do.
- Thank you.

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:30.038
Pull up a chair, Matthew.

01:02:35.485 --> 01:02:37.680
Glad you decided to join us, Matthew.

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:47.058
Could you maybe just... A little room.

01:02:52.668 --> 01:02:53.657
It...

01:02:53.770 --> 01:02:57.069
Hi. Thank you so much, Chef Didier.

01:02:57.173 --> 01:02:59.038
No, you are my preferred guest...

01:02:59.142 --> 01:03:02.805
and I have prepared a special menu
just for you tonight.

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:06.079
But I will make no substitutions.

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:07.316
Don't worry.

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:10.647
We will have your special menu
exactly the way you make it.

01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:12.819
No substitutions?

01:03:15.224 --> 01:03:16.816
No substitutions.

01:03:22.465 --> 01:03:24.126
That was delicious.

01:03:25.401 --> 01:03:27.266
- Oh, my goodness, I hurt myself.
- Thank you.

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:30.134
So, Georgia,
Ms. Burns tells me you're in retail.

01:03:30.339 --> 01:03:31.465
I was.

01:03:31.607 --> 01:03:34.201
Well, you've obviously done very well
for yourself.

01:03:34.310 --> 01:03:36.744
Actually, I just clipped a lot of coupons.

01:03:38.314 --> 01:03:41.647
And when you say coupons,
you obviously mean bonds?

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:44.584
No. No, I sold all my bonds.

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:46.980
You sold all of your bonds?

01:03:47.223 --> 01:03:49.191
Ms. Byrd, as Chairman
of the Commerce Committee...

01:03:49.292 --> 01:03:52.227
I'm always interested in how
savvy people such as yourself...

01:03:52.328 --> 01:03:53.795
operate the market.

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:56.660
Did you think that rates
were going up, or were you...

01:03:56.766 --> 01:03:58.358
pessimistic about the future?

01:03:58.467 --> 01:04:01.630
- Well, Congressman...
- Bob, please. Bob.

01:04:02.004 --> 01:04:06.270
Well, Bob, I find that the future
is too depressing to think about.

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:08.138
Oh, come on, Georgia.

01:04:08.244 --> 01:04:09.768
Miss Byrd,
what are you doing tomorrow?

01:04:09.879 --> 01:04:11.676
I would very much like to continue this...

01:04:11.781 --> 01:04:13.442
Well, hold on, hold on, hold on.

01:04:13.549 --> 01:04:17.076
You see, tomorrow I've arranged
for our group to go to Moser.

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:18.380
Moser? What's that?

01:04:18.487 --> 01:04:22.355
Moser! Glass. Factory.
All of us. Special tour.

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:24.984
That's what we're doing tomorrow.

01:04:25.862 --> 01:04:28.797
To answer your question,
I'm going BASE-jumping, Bob.

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:32.390
Really, BASE-jumping?
You're kidding! Well, why?

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:35.671
Well, I hear it's a completely
liberating experience.

01:04:36.038 --> 01:04:38.199
Well, at least that's what
the brochure says.

01:04:40.843 --> 01:04:42.504
Oh, that is amazing.

01:04:42.612 --> 01:04:44.773
Oh, come on, Matthew,
why don't we all go along and watch?

01:04:44.881 --> 01:04:46.109
It sounds like fun! Let's do that.

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:48.683
That is a great idea.
Better than some glass factory.

01:04:48.784 --> 01:04:53.118
Fine, fine, fine.
But I'm not going there to watch.

01:05:01.764 --> 01:05:05.291
So, because it's a dam
and not a straight jump...

01:05:05.401 --> 01:05:06.390
Yes.

01:05:06.502 --> 01:05:09.733
...when you don't do it right,
you will catch the current...

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:12.706
and it will slam you
in the side of the dam.

01:05:13.209 --> 01:05:15.404
So, we don't want that, okay?

01:05:16.178 --> 01:05:18.373
- So, are you ready?
- Yes, I am.

01:05:19.348 --> 01:05:21.407
- Go get them, Matthew!
- Come on!

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:25.678
Damn.

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.555
Okay, now we're gonna do this.

01:05:29.659 --> 01:05:32.219
I don't know what the hell makes people
want to do something like this.

01:05:32.328 --> 01:05:34.159
I try to avoid any plummeting sports.

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:37.289
Matthew's only doing it
because Georgia's doing it.

01:05:37.533 --> 01:05:39.524
He's the most competitive person
in the world.

01:05:39.635 --> 01:05:41.364
He may have met his match in Georgia.

01:05:41.470 --> 01:05:42.664
Camcorder!

01:05:42.772 --> 01:05:44.501
Oh. Bob, Bob, the camera.
You got the camera going?

01:05:44.607 --> 01:05:46.871
- We're rolling! Go ahead!
- Okay!

01:05:46.976 --> 01:05:49.444
Oh, oh. He's gonna... There we go.
He's going over the rail.

01:05:49.545 --> 01:05:51.274
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, wow.

01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:53.075
Oh, my God.

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:54.273
Oh, come on.

01:05:55.985 --> 01:05:57.612
All right, here we go.

01:05:57.753 --> 01:06:00.551
Okay. Look.

01:06:02.525 --> 01:06:04.493
I have told you before...

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:08.091
we have lost a couple of people
doing this.

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:11.193
- What, like people died?
- Yeah.

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:14.096
- Sugar.
- Which one first?

01:06:14.770 --> 01:06:16.203
Ladies first.

01:06:16.939 --> 01:06:18.668
Ladies first. Okay.

01:06:19.108 --> 01:06:20.234
Ready?

01:06:20.776 --> 01:06:22.767
- Three...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait!

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:28.213
- Okay. All right.
- Three, two, one, go!

01:06:38.794 --> 01:06:39.988
Perfect.

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:45.934
Whoa, baby!

01:06:46.369 --> 01:06:47.427
Okay.

01:06:48.671 --> 01:06:52.573
Three, two, one, go!

01:06:54.410 --> 01:06:55.843
Is there a problem?

01:06:56.045 --> 01:06:58.343
Yeah, I'd say there's a problem, Klaus.

01:06:58.447 --> 01:06:59.846
I know a thing or two
about BASE-jumping.

01:06:59.949 --> 01:07:02.782
I know that the canopy is supposed to
be connected to the rigging and it's not.

01:07:02.885 --> 01:07:05.410
And that's how people get killed.
No wonder you've lost a few people.

01:07:06.255 --> 01:07:08.155
Here I come. Watch it now!

01:07:08.657 --> 01:07:10.784
Oh, hold it now!

01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.393
I can't jump!

01:07:13.029 --> 01:07:15.725
Canopy not connected to rigging!

01:07:16.165 --> 01:07:18.429
- Mechanical difficulties!
- It's all right.

01:07:18.534 --> 01:07:20.798
- I don't know why this happens!
- It's all right.

01:07:20.903 --> 01:07:23.929
- What are you doing?
- Klaus, just shut up!

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.034
Oh, man.

01:07:28.611 --> 01:07:29.942
- It's so...
- Disappointing.

01:07:41.190 --> 01:07:42.384
Really?

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:47.854
She's the most amazing person
who ever came to this hotel.

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:48.930
Oh, yeah.

01:07:49.231 --> 01:07:50.789
She lives on the edge.

01:07:51.267 --> 01:07:54.031
She say what she wants.
She does what she wants.

01:07:54.370 --> 01:07:55.962
True existentialist.

01:07:56.872 --> 01:08:01.707
Hero worship, bought with a kiss
and an extravagant tip.

01:08:02.678 --> 01:08:04.612
She's a fraud, I tell you.

01:08:04.713 --> 01:08:08.911
Look what eating sauerkraut has done
to your heart, <i>Fräulein</i> Gunther.

01:08:23.899 --> 01:08:25.662
- Mr. Kragen.
- How are you?

01:08:25.768 --> 01:08:26.826
Good.

01:08:27.670 --> 01:08:30.468
Do me a favor. Georgia Byrd...

01:08:30.939 --> 01:08:35.639
just find out where she's from,
what she does.

01:08:36.245 --> 01:08:38.577
- Quietly.
- Of course, Mr. Kragen.

01:08:44.282 --> 01:08:48.981
Prince Dominic comes tonight.
He's insisted on my venison roast.

01:08:49.720 --> 01:08:51.346
A prince? A real prince?

01:08:51.456 --> 01:08:54.323
They have a charity dinner in town...

01:08:54.459 --> 01:08:56.723
where everybody gets to feel generous.

01:08:58.029 --> 01:09:00.361
I tell you, these people are all alike.

01:09:12.643 --> 01:09:14.941
Yes, you know, I tell you,
they are all alike.

01:09:15.046 --> 01:09:16.809
Oh, people are not as bad as you think.

01:09:16.913 --> 01:09:19.678
No, you're wrong, Georgia,
you're wrong. They are.

01:09:20.117 --> 01:09:24.314
Like Kragen at the hotel
who looks for life everlasting...

01:09:24.421 --> 01:09:27.983
in a tablespoon of extra-virgin olive oil,
you know.

01:09:32.897 --> 01:09:34.228
You know...

01:09:35.433 --> 01:09:39.233
you and I, we know the secret of life.

01:09:39.737 --> 01:09:41.295
Well, what is that?

01:09:41.439 --> 01:09:44.738
The secret of life is butter.

01:09:46.042 --> 01:09:48.477
Butter? Don't tell nobody.

01:09:49.580 --> 01:09:51.241
- Butter, huh?
- Butter, yes!

01:09:52.283 --> 01:09:54.478
Three cases of <i>écrevisses.</i>

01:09:55.453 --> 01:09:56.579
Hotel.

01:10:50.975 --> 01:10:54.206
- Georgia, there you are.
- We were worried you checked out.

01:10:54.312 --> 01:10:56.371
- No, not quite yet.
- Are you gonna join us for Smokey?

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:58.539
- Kragen's got it all arranged.
- No, I don't think so.

01:10:58.649 --> 01:11:00.674
I'm a little lightheaded
from all that rich food.

01:11:00.785 --> 01:11:03.754
Come on, Georgia, you have to join us
for some gambling.

01:11:03.854 --> 01:11:05.651
Look, I just think I want to...

01:11:05.756 --> 01:11:07.849
Yeah, well, you look exhausted
from all the heroics.

01:11:07.959 --> 01:11:09.688
You probably just wanna take it easy.

01:11:09.794 --> 01:11:13.093
Oh, no, come on, Georgia.
It won't be half as much fun without you.

01:11:13.197 --> 01:11:15.631
I don't know how much fun
it's gonna be. It's a charity event.

01:11:15.733 --> 01:11:18.361
Oh, it'll be a great time and Georgia
can help us liven up the evening.

01:11:18.469 --> 01:11:20.061
- It's gonna be great.
- Great time. Great time.

01:11:20.171 --> 01:11:21.729
Great time had by all.

01:11:21.839 --> 01:11:23.739
- Fine, fine.
- Good, it's settled then.

01:11:23.841 --> 01:11:26.105
Smokey Robinson.
You can't miss Smokey.

01:11:26.210 --> 01:11:27.768
Just take a little nap.

01:11:31.048 --> 01:11:34.950
<i>If you're reading this letter,</i>
<i>my disease has run its course.</i>

01:11:37.521 --> 01:11:40.081
<i>Enclosed is some money for my burial.</i>

01:11:43.561 --> 01:11:45.654
<i>I would like to be cremated.</i>

01:11:46.297 --> 01:11:48.492
<i>Spent my whole life in a box.</i>

01:11:49.367 --> 01:11:51.733
<i>I don't want to be buried in one.</i>

01:11:55.640 --> 01:11:57.631
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>because of turbulence...</i>

01:11:57.742 --> 01:11:59.607
<i>the captain has turned on</i>
<i>the "fasten seat belt" sign.</i>

01:11:59.710 --> 01:12:00.677
Excuse me.

01:12:00.778 --> 01:12:01.767
<i>Please return to your seats</i>
<i>and remain seated...</i>

01:12:01.879 --> 01:12:05.110
<i>with your seat belt fastened</i>
<i>while the sign is illuminated.</i>

01:12:06.150 --> 01:12:07.481
Scared of flying?

01:12:09.487 --> 01:12:12.752
- Do I look scared to you?
- I used to be scared, too.

01:12:14.125 --> 01:12:15.956
It helps if you color.

01:12:25.436 --> 01:12:28.098
Georgia, whatever you got,
give me some.

01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.940
Believe me, you don't want it.

01:12:31.409 --> 01:12:32.706
Place your bets.

01:12:32.810 --> 01:12:34.004
Don't know where to go.

01:12:34.111 --> 01:12:36.705
I'm following you wherever you go.

01:12:36.814 --> 01:12:40.045
That's a lunatic bet.
That's just a lunatic bet right there.

01:12:40.151 --> 01:12:42.278
Georgia, that's a lot of money.

01:12:42.386 --> 01:12:43.478
I know, huh?

01:12:43.587 --> 01:12:45.851
- You always bet on black, baby.
- Yeah?

01:12:45.956 --> 01:12:48.550
- Yes.
- All right. I'll give that a try.

01:12:52.229 --> 01:12:54.629
- No more bets.
- Matthew, Matthew...

01:12:54.732 --> 01:12:57.292
doing it your own way.
Georgia's our Lady Luck tonight.

01:12:57.401 --> 01:12:58.766
Come on, 17.

01:13:00.471 --> 01:13:01.631
Come on, 17.

01:13:01.739 --> 01:13:03.468
- Here we go.
- There it goes.

01:13:04.842 --> 01:13:07.709
- 17 black.
- Yeah!

01:13:10.448 --> 01:13:12.848
- That's the ball over there.
- Where to next, lucky?

01:13:12.950 --> 01:13:14.474
- What was that number I just played?
- 17.

01:13:14.585 --> 01:13:16.416
Seventeen. Sounds good to me.

01:13:16.520 --> 01:13:18.954
Isn't it a bit reckless
to bet on the same number twice?

01:13:19.056 --> 01:13:22.321
I guess that's why they call it gambling
and not crocheting.

01:13:23.027 --> 01:13:24.289
Gambling it is.

01:13:24.495 --> 01:13:26.725
- Well, the house is loving you guys.
- I'm in.

01:13:26.831 --> 01:13:28.560
- Place your bets.
- Me, too.

01:13:29.266 --> 01:13:31.700
Here we go, here we go,
here we go. Red.

01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:34.703
No more bets.

01:13:35.206 --> 01:13:37.299
- Come on, show me something.
- Come on, 17.

01:13:37.408 --> 01:13:39.638
- Come on.
- Big money, big money!

01:13:39.744 --> 01:13:42.178
- Come on, come on, come on.
- Red, come on.

01:13:43.247 --> 01:13:44.475
17 black!

01:13:45.082 --> 01:13:46.413
- What?
- Yes!

01:13:46.851 --> 01:13:48.512
Oh, my Lord!

01:13:49.720 --> 01:13:51.654
Give me a little kickback over here.

01:13:53.390 --> 01:13:54.687
- Thank you.
- Wow.

01:13:54.792 --> 01:13:56.623
<i>Mesdames et messieurs,</i>
place your bets.

01:13:56.727 --> 01:13:58.752
Place it, place it.
What are we doin' here?

01:13:58.863 --> 01:14:00.490
I'm going with 17.

01:14:00.931 --> 01:14:02.592
Georgia, you can't go there a third time.

01:14:02.733 --> 01:14:03.722
A third time? Come on!

01:14:03.834 --> 01:14:06.029
Come over here
and get some of this luck.

01:14:06.137 --> 01:14:08.128
Maybe I am pushing it a little bit.

01:14:08.239 --> 01:14:09.706
I was born on the 13th.

01:14:09.807 --> 01:14:11.502
Thirteen, thirteen.
Put this on the thirteen.

01:14:11.609 --> 01:14:13.099
You sure about that?

01:14:13.744 --> 01:14:16.736
But then again,
I lost my mama when I was 11.

01:14:16.847 --> 01:14:18.781
Good idea.
Double me up. Double me up.

01:14:18.883 --> 01:14:21.181
Eleven. Yeah. Thank you. Eleven.

01:14:22.086 --> 01:14:25.180
- I love my mama.
- Could you please just place the bet?

01:14:25.589 --> 01:14:28.183
But my mama was born on the 17th.
What am I doing?

01:14:28.292 --> 01:14:31.887
- Oh, come on, bet!
- Wherever you're going, I'm following.

01:14:31.996 --> 01:14:33.190
No more bets.

01:14:33.297 --> 01:14:34.321
Thank you.

01:14:38.836 --> 01:14:41.669
- Here we go!
- Come on, come on.

01:14:43.307 --> 01:14:44.899
- Come on, come on.
- Come on, come on.

01:14:45.009 --> 01:14:46.874
Come on, please, 17. 17. 17.

01:14:48.913 --> 01:14:50.141
17 black.

01:14:50.815 --> 01:14:51.873
What?

01:14:52.183 --> 01:14:53.377
Georgia!

01:14:59.824 --> 01:15:02.952
Great. Now you change my luck
for the better?

01:15:04.528 --> 01:15:06.519
You know what?
I'm not playing with you no more.

01:15:06.630 --> 01:15:09.724
- Can I cash in my chips, please?
- Yes, I'd like to cash in mine, as well.

01:15:09.834 --> 01:15:11.699
And me, too. Thank you.

01:15:15.706 --> 01:15:16.695
Gosh, how much?

01:15:16.807 --> 01:15:21.676
That's 3,546,305 crowns.

01:15:21.779 --> 01:15:22.803
Wow.

01:15:23.948 --> 01:15:27.850
- How much would you guess that is?
- That's about $100,000.

01:15:28.886 --> 01:15:29.875
Wow!

01:16:13.464 --> 01:16:15.056
Not very well-traveled.

01:16:20.504 --> 01:16:22.335
Sales associate?

01:16:22.740 --> 01:16:26.676
I wonder if your new friends would be
so impressed if they knew the truth.

01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:24.963
Oh, <i>mademoiselle...</i>

01:17:41.952 --> 01:17:46.321
You were incredible tonight.
You amazed us all.

01:17:47.324 --> 01:17:48.882
And myself, too.

01:17:49.526 --> 01:17:53.394
So, how is it the two of us never
bumped into each other back home?

01:17:53.497 --> 01:17:56.091
Probably because you're not home
that much anymore.

01:17:56.200 --> 01:17:58.430
Well, Washington
is a hard place to resist.

01:17:58.535 --> 01:18:00.799
Come visit me sometime. You'll see.

01:18:00.938 --> 01:18:04.601
I'm sorry,
but I just can't seem to get past...

01:18:04.708 --> 01:18:08.144
that big flashing "for sale" sign
on your forehead.

01:18:08.245 --> 01:18:11.180
- What are you talking about?
- You know what I'm talking about.

01:18:11.281 --> 01:18:13.442
What are you doing here with Kragen?

01:18:13.550 --> 01:18:16.314
I mean, what exactly is it
that you two do for each other?

01:18:16.420 --> 01:18:20.186
I'm helping him over some regulatory
hurdles in committee, that's all.

01:18:20.290 --> 01:18:23.316
Well, it seems like you should be
helping some of your own people...

01:18:23.427 --> 01:18:24.826
over some hurdles.

01:18:24.928 --> 01:18:26.486
I mean, precious little's happened...

01:18:26.597 --> 01:18:29.498
with that Community Redevelopment
Program of yours.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:33.468
And nothing ever will happen with
that youth center unless I get re-elected.

01:18:33.570 --> 01:18:37.336
Having generous supporters
like Matthew Kragen is a political reality.

01:18:37.574 --> 01:18:39.041
Yeah, well...

01:18:39.943 --> 01:18:41.535
I'm sorry, but...

01:18:43.180 --> 01:18:47.241
I only have time for reality realities.
Good night.

01:18:49.753 --> 01:18:51.220
Good night, Georgia.

01:18:58.462 --> 01:19:02.762
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Byrd, I hear you were
the highlight at the casino tonight.

01:19:04.234 --> 01:19:07.397
- I don't know about that.
- But there's no need to be humble.

01:19:07.504 --> 01:19:09.699
Did you have a marvelous time?

01:19:10.541 --> 01:19:12.566
Why're you being so nice to me?

01:19:12.676 --> 01:19:16.544
Yeah, I know. I'm a bitch.
At least that's what people tell me.

01:19:17.281 --> 01:19:18.543
Oh, Miss Gunther...

01:19:18.649 --> 01:19:21.584
no, you're not. You're just like
a lot of women who work too hard.

01:19:21.685 --> 01:19:23.949
And yet you are always so kind.

01:19:24.855 --> 01:19:28.086
You are a woman of distinction
and courage.

01:19:29.726 --> 01:19:32.320
Yeah, apparently I am, all of a sudden.

01:19:32.863 --> 01:19:35.423
Wish it had happened a little sooner.

01:19:39.970 --> 01:19:41.130
Miss Gunther.

01:19:41.505 --> 01:19:43.370
I hope you're not trying
to make a pass at me...

01:19:43.474 --> 01:19:45.942
'cause I really can't handle that
right now.

01:19:46.743 --> 01:19:50.770
Please don't die, Miss Byrd.
I read the note.

01:19:52.015 --> 01:19:55.746
- You went through my stuff?
- Oh, yeah, I go through everyone's stuff.

01:19:55.986 --> 01:19:57.385
I apologize.

01:19:59.823 --> 01:20:01.688
Well, to tell you the truth,
I'm kind of relieved...

01:20:01.792 --> 01:20:03.851
to have somebody to share it with.

01:20:04.528 --> 01:20:08.259
Don't worry, I'll be with you here
to the very end.

01:20:13.003 --> 01:20:15.870
I don't know if I want to be here
to the very end.

01:20:15.973 --> 01:20:18.840
Why are you here
with these terrible people?

01:20:19.843 --> 01:20:21.970
You should be with people you love.

01:20:23.814 --> 01:20:26.282
Yeah, I've been thinking
about that myself.

01:20:27.284 --> 01:20:28.911
One in particular.

01:20:30.821 --> 01:20:32.880
It's time I go home and find him.

01:20:45.002 --> 01:20:46.264
Thank you, God.

01:21:49.933 --> 01:21:51.696
That's a lot of snow.

01:21:57.874 --> 01:22:00.206
- What's going on here?
- It's an avalanche.

01:22:00.310 --> 01:22:02.972
I'm sorry, but we'll have to go back.

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:05.913
I can't believe this happened
on New Year's Eve.

01:22:06.016 --> 01:22:09.042
You're just not gonna cut me
any slack at all, are you?

01:22:11.655 --> 01:22:13.623
You're telling me there's nothing else?

01:22:13.724 --> 01:22:17.751
- I wanted you to find out everything...
- As I told you before, nothing.

01:22:18.829 --> 01:22:20.922
- Nothing?
- Nothing out of the ordinary.

01:22:21.031 --> 01:22:23.192
Except that she is a saint.

01:22:23.867 --> 01:22:25.926
- And from New Orleans.
- Yes.

01:22:27.004 --> 01:22:30.201
- And her occupation?
- You should know. She works for you.

01:22:30.507 --> 01:22:32.600
- Now, please.
- Wait, wait, wait.

01:22:32.709 --> 01:22:35.439
- She works for me?
- That's all I know and all I'm telling.

01:22:35.545 --> 01:22:37.035
Here's your tip back.

01:22:45.822 --> 01:22:47.949
At this rate,
we're going to be here all night.

01:22:48.058 --> 01:22:51.459
Oh, no, we are not.
We are going back down the mountain.

01:22:52.029 --> 01:22:54.463
I prefer to spend the night with my wife.

01:22:58.769 --> 01:23:01.101
Hey, what are you doing?

01:23:02.239 --> 01:23:06.141
- Are you crazy? It's dangerous.
- Yeah, I know.

01:23:06.543 --> 01:23:09.034
But I don't have much time.
Keep the change.

01:23:10.547 --> 01:23:11.741
Wish me luck.

01:23:34.271 --> 01:23:35.636
I hate snow.

01:23:38.241 --> 01:23:39.799
Snow sucks.

01:23:43.213 --> 01:23:45.613
Cookware? Are you sure?

01:24:14.644 --> 01:24:17.545
I heard you were a little shorthanded
because of this avalanche.

01:24:17.647 --> 01:24:20.514
I just thought I'd check
to see if you needed any help.

01:24:20.617 --> 01:24:22.983
But I don't want to get in your way
or nothing.

01:24:23.086 --> 01:24:25.782
No, no, no, it would be an honor,
a privilege.

01:24:28.625 --> 01:24:30.058
What is this?

01:24:31.261 --> 01:24:32.728
It's a turnip.

01:24:33.397 --> 01:24:36.161
No, it's not. That can't be no turnip.

01:24:37.267 --> 01:24:40.896
The poor baby turnips.
Nobody likes them, you know?

01:24:41.671 --> 01:24:42.638
Of course.

01:24:42.739 --> 01:24:45.833
Life is easy if you are a truffle
or a shiitake mushroom.

01:24:46.176 --> 01:24:48.872
But the turnip is to be loved...

01:24:49.613 --> 01:24:52.673
because she's a self-made woman
of vegetables.

01:24:52.783 --> 01:24:55.911
All the others you can only destroy
with cooking.

01:24:56.119 --> 01:24:58.815
But the turnip, she gets better.

01:24:59.589 --> 01:25:02.183
So, you see, it's not how you start...

01:25:06.329 --> 01:25:08.024
but how you finish.

01:25:11.668 --> 01:25:13.158
That's gonna be good!

01:25:14.571 --> 01:25:16.630
The first time I saw you...

01:25:16.907 --> 01:25:21.241
I was so happy
to see your appetite for food...

01:25:22.646 --> 01:25:23.874
for life.

01:25:29.686 --> 01:25:31.119
I'm so sorry.

01:25:32.355 --> 01:25:33.549
Gunther.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.752
Does anybody else know?

01:25:40.030 --> 01:25:41.054
No.

01:25:42.165 --> 01:25:43.223
Okay.

01:25:43.834 --> 01:25:46.928
Well, good.
Let's not say anything, all right?

01:25:47.871 --> 01:25:50.135
Let's just... Let's just cook.

01:25:53.944 --> 01:25:56.105
The onions, they make me cry.

01:27:52.629 --> 01:27:55.189
You have been very lucky.

01:27:57.867 --> 01:28:00.768
Well, you didn't get everything
you wanted...

01:28:00.971 --> 01:28:02.302
but you have...

01:28:06.710 --> 01:28:09.702
Next time, we do things different.

01:28:10.280 --> 01:28:13.181
We will laugh more, we'll love more.

01:28:15.085 --> 01:28:16.814
We'll see the world.

01:28:17.821 --> 01:28:19.880
We just won't be so afraid.

01:28:27.797 --> 01:28:29.287
Happy New Year.

01:28:34.704 --> 01:28:36.069
Look at you.

01:29:00.063 --> 01:29:03.931
Now, see, look at these tumors.
Georgia Byrd, Mr. Smith, and mine.

01:29:04.067 --> 01:29:06.262
Now there's no way,
even if we all had it...

01:29:06.369 --> 01:29:08.701
that they would be
exactly in the same place.

01:29:08.805 --> 01:29:12.206
So, I said to myself, "Rabindranath,
it has to be the machine."

01:29:14.411 --> 01:29:15.776
Oh, my God.

01:29:30.326 --> 01:29:31.816
Thanks. I'll see you.

01:29:34.297 --> 01:29:36.527
Excuse me, young man,
do you live here?

01:29:36.633 --> 01:29:37.861
Yeah, I live right here.

01:29:37.967 --> 01:29:41.130
- Please tell me you know Georgia Byrd.
- Yeah, I know Georgia.

01:29:41.237 --> 01:29:42.135
Thank you.

01:29:45.108 --> 01:29:47.235
Tonight I'd like to make a toast...

01:29:47.343 --> 01:29:49.834
to a woman whose presence
has captivated us.

01:29:51.081 --> 01:29:52.639
To Georgia Byrd.

01:29:53.016 --> 01:29:54.608
Well, hear, hear.

01:29:54.718 --> 01:29:55.878
To Georgia.

01:29:55.985 --> 01:29:58.453
Now, who is this fascinating woman?

01:29:58.755 --> 01:30:01.781
It's the question
we've been asking ourselves all week.

01:30:01.891 --> 01:30:05.292
Is she a representative
from a competing boardroom?

01:30:05.729 --> 01:30:09.688
Is she a power broker from the corridors
of our nation's capital?

01:30:10.066 --> 01:30:14.230
Is she a brash
and successful entrepreneur?

01:30:14.838 --> 01:30:19.400
The truth, which I discovered tonight,
will amuse you.

01:30:19.642 --> 01:30:22.941
You see, Georgia Byrd is a sales clerk...

01:30:23.480 --> 01:30:25.414
in my New Orleans store.

01:30:25.548 --> 01:30:27.778
In the cookware department, no less.

01:30:27.884 --> 01:30:30.876
Salary? $29,000 a year.

01:30:31.454 --> 01:30:32.421
Cheers, Georgia.

01:30:32.522 --> 01:30:34.183
- What?
- No.

01:30:35.058 --> 01:30:37.219
Or as we might say back home:

01:30:38.261 --> 01:30:42.254
"Attention Kragen shoppers,
impostor, aisle three."

01:30:44.934 --> 01:30:47.402
Oh, come on. Georgia, is this true?

01:30:52.008 --> 01:30:53.839
Mr. Kragen is right about me.

01:30:54.444 --> 01:30:57.140
I'm just a sales associate
in one of his stores.

01:30:57.914 --> 01:31:01.680
One of the best.
Or I was up until a couple of weeks ago.

01:31:02.318 --> 01:31:05.287
- That's when...
- You owe these people no explanation.

01:31:05.388 --> 01:31:07.788
No, excuse me. I think she does.

01:31:07.891 --> 01:31:10.792
She's had plenty to say
about our behavior all week...

01:31:10.894 --> 01:31:12.623
and the only reason we took it was...

01:31:12.729 --> 01:31:15.220
because we thought
she was somebody.

01:31:15.331 --> 01:31:16.889
Well, I'm sorry.

01:31:17.133 --> 01:31:20.364
I didn't come here to give anybody
the wrong impression about me.

01:31:20.470 --> 01:31:23.405
I just came here to blow
every last cent of my money.

01:31:26.442 --> 01:31:27.704
You see...

01:31:29.979 --> 01:31:31.446
I'm gonna die.

01:31:32.115 --> 01:31:34.583
- Georgia, please.
- Oh, it's okay, it's okay.

01:31:34.951 --> 01:31:36.213
It's all right.

01:31:39.722 --> 01:31:43.123
Yeah, see, I had that same reaction
when I found out...

01:31:43.226 --> 01:31:45.217
I only had three weeks to live.

01:31:45.328 --> 01:31:49.128
I mean, I tried to keep it to myself
for exactly this reason.

01:31:50.266 --> 01:31:52.461
It's a party-killer, ain't it?

01:31:57.874 --> 01:32:00.342
But I did land on that mountaintop.

01:32:01.544 --> 01:32:04.707
And I ended up on the cover
of a ski magazine.

01:32:06.382 --> 01:32:08.577
Don't feel sorry for me, baby.

01:32:09.786 --> 01:32:12.050
Never in my life did I think...

01:32:12.388 --> 01:32:15.186
I would end up
in such a beautiful place...

01:32:15.692 --> 01:32:17.751
doing so many incredible things.

01:32:20.430 --> 01:32:21.488
So...

01:32:23.166 --> 01:32:24.929
I'm sorry if I was...

01:32:25.869 --> 01:32:28.337
maybe a little too honest with you.

01:32:30.039 --> 01:32:33.236
But I wasted too much of my life
being quiet.

01:32:36.779 --> 01:32:38.610
I was afraid, I guess.

01:32:40.016 --> 01:32:41.711
You know how it is.

01:32:42.352 --> 01:32:46.220
You keep your head down
and you hustle and hustle.

01:32:47.323 --> 01:32:49.757
Then you look up one day and wonder:

01:32:49.859 --> 01:32:52.259
"How did I even get here?"
Huh, bro?

01:32:54.330 --> 01:32:58.289
See, some of the things
we care about a lot are pretty worthless.

01:33:00.737 --> 01:33:01.795
So...

01:33:04.007 --> 01:33:06.601
I hope I haven't spoiled your evening.

01:33:08.177 --> 01:33:09.303
And...

01:33:12.081 --> 01:33:13.878
it's truly been my pleasure.

01:33:16.019 --> 01:33:17.509
Happy New Year.

01:33:19.822 --> 01:33:22.313
- Happy New Year, Georgia.
- Thank you.

01:33:28.131 --> 01:33:29.325
Asshole.

01:33:30.967 --> 01:33:33.834
That's a very appropriate sentiment,
darling.

01:33:36.472 --> 01:33:39.873
I second that.
Happy New Year, Matthew.

01:33:46.816 --> 01:33:48.545
Where are you going?

01:33:50.386 --> 01:33:52.752
Well, first I'm gonna find Georgia.

01:33:53.122 --> 01:33:54.919
And then I'm gonna go back to school...

01:33:55.024 --> 01:33:57.219
and I'm going to get
my business degree.

01:33:57.327 --> 01:34:00.626
And then one day, when your wife
finally decides to divorce you...

01:34:00.730 --> 01:34:02.698
and takes half of everything you have...

01:34:02.799 --> 01:34:06.997
I'll only be too happy to help her figure
out exactly how much that should be.

01:35:02.291 --> 01:35:04.316
Marie, what are you doing?

01:35:05.495 --> 01:35:08.293
Has that ceiling
ever made you want to cry?

01:35:11.934 --> 01:35:15.301
What ceiling? Get back to work.

01:35:28.518 --> 01:35:29.815
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:35:30.887 --> 01:35:33.754
Georgia, I just wanted to say
how sorry I am that...

01:35:34.390 --> 01:35:37.291
Girl, it's okay. I know you are.

01:35:38.327 --> 01:35:42.229
I left Matthew.
I'm going to the airport now.

01:35:43.366 --> 01:35:46.028
Oh, well, I don't know if they've cleared
the road yet to the airport.

01:35:46.135 --> 01:35:47.500
- What do you mean?
- The avalanche and stuff.

01:35:47.603 --> 01:35:49.730
Ms. Byrd,
something terrible has happened.

01:35:49.839 --> 01:35:52.171
Matthew Kragen's
jumped out a window?

01:35:52.275 --> 01:35:54.766
Pity, but not yet. He's still on the ledge.

01:35:55.211 --> 01:35:56.235
- What?
- Come on.

01:35:56.345 --> 01:35:57.778
I'll get my jacket.

01:35:59.382 --> 01:36:01.009
What's going... Wait a minute.

01:36:01.117 --> 01:36:03.608
Who? Hey, that's Kragen!

01:36:04.987 --> 01:36:08.787
- What the hell is he doing?
- He does not take rejection well.

01:36:13.062 --> 01:36:14.256
Matthew!

01:36:16.766 --> 01:36:18.563
Matthew, what are you doing?

01:36:30.012 --> 01:36:32.606
- What you doing?
- Thinking.

01:36:33.249 --> 01:36:35.843
- About what?
- Not falling.

01:36:36.953 --> 01:36:39.820
- Oh, no. What's she doing out there?
- Oh, my goodness.

01:36:39.922 --> 01:36:41.549
This is crazy.

01:36:48.164 --> 01:36:50.598
You don't have to be nice to me.
I know I'm a jerk.

01:36:50.700 --> 01:36:52.793
You don't think I know I'm a jerk?

01:36:53.035 --> 01:36:55.526
Oh, so, this is where jerks come
to hang out?

01:36:57.073 --> 01:36:59.598
You're starting to get
a little crowd down there.

01:36:59.709 --> 01:37:00.937
Happy New Year!

01:37:01.477 --> 01:37:04.002
- Wave to the people.
- Happy New Year!

01:37:04.113 --> 01:37:05.637
I can't believe this guy.

01:37:05.748 --> 01:37:07.716
- Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!

01:37:07.817 --> 01:37:11.309
- They'd like me to jump.
- Well, don't start people-pleasing now.

01:37:12.622 --> 01:37:15.147
Matthew. Come back in here.

01:37:15.258 --> 01:37:18.455
You know you're not gonna jump.
You couldn't even jump off the dam.

01:37:18.561 --> 01:37:20.188
Equipment failure.

01:37:20.897 --> 01:37:23.991
- See? You know...
- Miss Burns, let me handle this, please.

01:37:25.501 --> 01:37:29.631
Mr. Kragen, you know what?
You're really starting to piss me off.

01:37:30.273 --> 01:37:32.673
- Give me that.
- No, no, no.

01:37:32.808 --> 01:37:34.241
Oh, heads up!

01:37:36.546 --> 01:37:38.446
Damn, that is a long drop.

01:37:39.682 --> 01:37:43.982
Look, a guy like you has all the money
and time in the world...

01:37:44.153 --> 01:37:46.553
to turn things around for himself,
you know?

01:37:46.656 --> 01:37:48.749
So, just stop whining and get with it.

01:37:48.858 --> 01:37:50.723
Get with what, exactly?

01:37:51.661 --> 01:37:53.652
I don't know. I mean, I don't have...

01:37:53.763 --> 01:37:56.960
Georgia Byrd's five rules
to how to be a better human being.

01:37:57.066 --> 01:37:59.261
All I know is, if you want somebody
to care about you...

01:37:59.368 --> 01:38:01.962
stop trying to buy and sell them
all the time.

01:38:03.039 --> 01:38:04.199
Do I do that?

01:38:05.908 --> 01:38:07.170
And you know what?

01:38:07.276 --> 01:38:10.973
Get your pasty face off the cover
of your own magazine every month.

01:38:11.614 --> 01:38:14.014
Yep, that's the face right there.

01:38:15.351 --> 01:38:16.477
Every month!

01:38:19.121 --> 01:38:21.885
I can't believe I had somebody like you
working for me all this time.

01:38:21.991 --> 01:38:23.856
Well, I wasn't gonna work
for you forever.

01:38:23.960 --> 01:38:25.484
I had plans, you know.

01:38:25.595 --> 01:38:27.756
Yeah? What were you gonna do?

01:38:28.197 --> 01:38:31.689
Well, nothing big by your standards.

01:38:33.035 --> 01:38:35.833
But I was gonna open me up
a little restaurant.

01:38:36.239 --> 01:38:37.672
Bistro style.

01:38:38.441 --> 01:38:42.241
And, of course, a husband and a family.

01:38:46.616 --> 01:38:48.550
Do you have a boyfriend?

01:38:49.885 --> 01:38:52.149
Well, I wouldn't call him that.

01:38:52.655 --> 01:38:55.783
He works for your company, too.
His name is Sean.

01:38:56.025 --> 01:38:58.084
Georgia!

01:38:59.829 --> 01:39:02.093
- It's starting to happen.
- What?

01:39:02.698 --> 01:39:05.826
I mean, I can hear him
calling my name right now.

01:39:06.502 --> 01:39:09.266
Well, someone actually
did call your name.

01:39:11.774 --> 01:39:12.968
Georgia!

01:39:13.476 --> 01:39:16.240
- Is that...
- Sean, what are you doing here?

01:39:19.181 --> 01:39:20.773
Wait, I'm coming!

01:39:27.189 --> 01:39:29.749
- You are here to see Miss Byrd?
- Yeah, how did you know?

01:39:29.859 --> 01:39:31.224
Lucky guess.

01:39:41.671 --> 01:39:44.139
Do you have the arrivals list
for tomorrow?

01:39:46.676 --> 01:39:50.077
And where is everyone?
I don't have any help upstairs.

01:40:04.360 --> 01:40:06.225
Yeah, I'll take care of this.

01:40:07.263 --> 01:40:08.389
Georgia!

01:40:09.432 --> 01:40:11.400
What the hell? I mean...

01:40:12.435 --> 01:40:13.459
Come on.

01:40:13.569 --> 01:40:14.968
How many people
can get on that ledge?

01:40:15.071 --> 01:40:16.538
Who the hell is that?

01:40:16.639 --> 01:40:18.504
Sean, what you doing here?

01:40:18.674 --> 01:40:22.075
Well, I found out, you know,
about the Lampington's disease...

01:40:22.178 --> 01:40:24.169
and, well, I up and quit my job.

01:40:24.280 --> 01:40:26.339
Well, what would make you do
something like that?

01:40:26.449 --> 01:40:30.146
I didn't feel like I had a future there.
Besides, after you quit...

01:40:31.253 --> 01:40:33.847
I didn't feel like I had a reason
to be there.

01:40:35.391 --> 01:40:38.417
It seemed like there should be
more possibilities in life.

01:40:38.527 --> 01:40:41.894
Oh, no! You done up
and read my Possibilities book.

01:40:42.331 --> 01:40:44.925
Well, what exactly
is a Possibilities book?

01:40:45.034 --> 01:40:48.265
Georgia, I gotta talk to you.

01:40:48.571 --> 01:40:51.005
Okay. Talk to me.

01:40:51.374 --> 01:40:53.842
I can't do it now, here on a ledge!

01:40:54.643 --> 01:40:56.008
Come on now, you're gonna have to.

01:40:56.112 --> 01:40:58.580
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

01:40:59.882 --> 01:41:01.474
Well, look, I...

01:41:02.818 --> 01:41:05.946
Georgia, I had all kind of thoughts
running through my mind.

01:41:06.055 --> 01:41:10.389
I should've told you this a long time ago.
I don't know what I thought or...

01:41:10.493 --> 01:41:12.757
It doesn't even matter what I thought.

01:41:15.998 --> 01:41:17.659
I have feelings for you.

01:41:19.034 --> 01:41:21.502
Georgia Byrd, I want to be with you.

01:41:22.405 --> 01:41:26.967
Whether if it's for five minutes
here on this ledge, or 50 years.

01:41:28.944 --> 01:41:32.209
- I like this guy. Good guy.
- Me, too.

01:41:35.084 --> 01:41:37.314
Oh, come on, knock it off.

01:41:37.420 --> 01:41:39.251
Now, why you gonna send him
all the way around here...

01:41:39.355 --> 01:41:41.380
when you know I gotta die?

01:41:42.224 --> 01:41:44.692
- Who you talking to, baby?
- God.

01:41:46.629 --> 01:41:47.755
Hello!

01:41:48.564 --> 01:41:50.088
Oh, God.

01:41:50.866 --> 01:41:53.801
- We're the only ones not up there.
- We should join them.

01:41:53.903 --> 01:41:58.465
Urgent fax to Miss Georgia Byrd
from Dr. R. Gupta!

01:41:58.607 --> 01:42:02.543
You were misdiagnosed
due to a faulty dog scan.

01:42:02.778 --> 01:42:07.215
You don't have Lampington's disease.
You're going to live!

01:42:07.483 --> 01:42:09.781
- I'm not gonna die?
- No!

01:42:09.985 --> 01:42:12.112
- I'm gonna live?
- Yes!

01:42:12.221 --> 01:42:17.056
I'm gonna live! I'm gonna live!
I'm going to live, everybody!

01:42:21.430 --> 01:42:24.331
I hope that doesn't mean you want
to rethink that last statement.

01:42:24.433 --> 01:42:27.129
About the five minutes or the 50 years,
and all that.

01:42:27.236 --> 01:42:28.396
Oh, no.

01:42:29.104 --> 01:42:32.699
Five minutes, 50 years, 100 years,
a million years...

01:42:34.143 --> 01:42:35.337
my whole life!

01:42:39.782 --> 01:42:41.113
All right!

01:42:47.056 --> 01:42:48.250
All right!

01:42:48.357 --> 01:42:50.291
- Can we get off this ledge now?
- Yeah.

01:42:50.392 --> 01:42:52.792
It's colder than a snowman's ass
out here.

01:42:54.029 --> 01:42:56.054
What do you say, Mr. Kragen?
You ready?

01:42:56.165 --> 01:42:59.828
- You had enough of this?
- Yeah, go in inside.

01:43:00.002 --> 01:43:03.438
- Yeah, it's time to get warm.
- Give me your hand. Careful, careful.

01:43:03.539 --> 01:43:04.904
I want to tell you, thank you...

01:43:05.007 --> 01:43:07.703
and I'm gonna make
a lot of changes in my life.

01:43:08.110 --> 01:43:11.637
I'm gonna put somebody else
on the cover of the magazine, too.

01:43:13.749 --> 01:43:16.274
You are funny.
You had me going for a minute.

01:43:16.552 --> 01:43:18.281
You so wrong.
How you gonna do me like that?

01:43:18.387 --> 01:43:20.685
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:43:32.268 --> 01:43:34.828
Yeah, now we go.
Put them crawfish in there, baby.

01:43:34.937 --> 01:43:36.928
How about a little taste? Smell.

01:43:37.606 --> 01:43:39.938
Don't ask me. I'm only here on holiday.

01:43:42.678 --> 01:43:45.010
Yeah, don't be careful now, huh?

01:43:47.349 --> 01:43:50.841
Hey, it's getting crazy out there!
Everybody's arriving.

01:43:53.455 --> 01:43:56.424
- Come on, baby, let's go.
- Go out and see to your friends.

01:43:56.525 --> 01:43:58.322
And I'll take care of the rest.

01:43:58.427 --> 01:43:59.416
- Okay?
- Okay.

01:43:59.528 --> 01:44:02.520
Remember, it's not how you start,
it's how you finish.

01:44:02.631 --> 01:44:03.962
Okay, all right.

01:44:05.234 --> 01:44:06.360
<i>Merci!</i>

01:44:16.278 --> 01:44:20.214
- Welcome. Welcome. Welcome.
- Thank you for coming.

01:44:20.316 --> 01:44:23.217
- Thank you so much for coming.
- Welcome to Georgia's.

01:44:23.919 --> 01:44:26.183
- My baby!
- Tough guy!

01:44:26.522 --> 01:44:28.990
- Who's my little guy?
- Congratulations.

01:44:30.426 --> 01:44:32.724
- Rochelle.
- Thank you. Thank you.

01:44:33.796 --> 01:44:35.127
You did it!

01:44:36.432 --> 01:44:37.831
- I quit my job.
- Thank you.

01:44:37.933 --> 01:44:39.457
You did? Oh, congratulations.

01:44:39.568 --> 01:44:41.593
- I quit my job!
- You should never have had that job.

01:44:41.704 --> 01:44:43.194
- I'm so glad.
- Hi, I quit my job!

01:44:43.305 --> 01:44:46.866
Hi, Mr. Mayor. Hi, Mrs. Dean.
How're you doing?

01:44:46.976 --> 01:44:48.841
- Welcome.
- Come on in to Georgia's.

01:44:48.944 --> 01:44:51.310
Good to see you.
Mrs. Dean, it's a pleasure.

01:44:54.650 --> 01:44:57.175
Congratulations!
Thank you so much for inviting me.

01:44:57.286 --> 01:44:59.982
- Thank you for coming!
- Thank you. Congratulations.

01:45:00.089 --> 01:45:01.716
- She loves you.
- Congratulations.

01:45:01.824 --> 01:45:03.223
Thanks for coming.

01:45:03.325 --> 01:45:04.292
Pleasure.
