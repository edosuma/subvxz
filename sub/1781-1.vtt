04:35.400 --> 04:37.299
I thought I'd give you a lift.

04:38.699 --> 04:39.966
What happened to you?

04:40.846 --> 04:42.870
A rough night. Tell you later.

04:58.300 --> 04:59.442
You okay?

05:00.328 --> 05:01.470
Yeah, fine.

05:02.515 --> 05:03.657
And the job?

05:04.820 --> 05:05.849
Okay.

05:12.295 --> 05:14.194
And your son...
Got him this weekend?

05:14.839 --> 05:15.908
I don't know.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.031
You're a real chatterbox.

05:28.399 --> 05:30.310
We might take the kids
for the weekend.

05:31.239 --> 05:33.753
I don't know what I'm doing Saturday.

05:34.199 --> 05:35.154
Okay.

05:38.519 --> 05:40.191
I'll quit inviting you.

05:46.719 --> 05:48.357
What's he doing?

05:48.919 --> 05:50.272
Move it!

05:59.319 --> 06:00.354
Where's my coffee?

06:00.559 --> 06:01.753
It's on its way.

06:08.279 --> 06:10.792
About these night hours...
I can't stay.

06:10.998 --> 06:13.114
You'll have to.
The extra is out sick.

06:13.358 --> 06:15.314
- I need all hands.
- And my son?

06:15.998 --> 06:18.193
Do like me, ask your wife.

06:21.038 --> 06:22.551
Is the coffee walking in?

06:23.238 --> 06:24.990
Get off me with your coffee.

06:53.318 --> 06:54.512
Not working nights?

06:55.558 --> 06:57.469
Great. We can team up now.

07:08.397 --> 07:09.273
Hey buddy.

07:11.277 --> 07:12.346
What's that?

07:17.117 --> 07:18.072
Sorry, not mine.

07:18.277 --> 07:20.427
Why are you sorry then?

07:21.677 --> 07:22.553
Pick 'em up.

07:25.477 --> 07:26.990
You deaf or something?

07:37.397 --> 07:38.625
Pick 'em up.

07:39.637 --> 07:40.672
That's a good boy.

07:42.357 --> 07:44.393
Good little security car driver.

07:48.237 --> 07:49.386
Hurry up.

07:50.997 --> 07:51.827
Give.

07:52.117 --> 07:53.106
Get lost.

07:53.317 --> 07:54.147
Get lost, I said.

07:54.517 --> 07:56.428
<i>/t rains every day...</i>

07:56.637 --> 07:58.309
Manon, darling.

07:58.597 --> 08:00.315
Auntie says you were a pain.

08:00.917 --> 08:03.032
It's not true. I'm real nice.

08:03.396 --> 08:04.306
<i>You're nice.</i>

08:04.876 --> 08:06.707
<i>So auntie's a /iar?</i>

08:09.716 --> 08:14.506
Listen, dear. I miss you too
but three days isn't long.

08:15.756 --> 08:18.224
<i>You know your daddy</i>
<i>rea//y /oves you.</i>

08:18.436 --> 08:19.994
I love you too.

08:21.196 --> 08:23.232
<i>Auntie's taking me to a movie.</i>

08:23.436 --> 08:25.347
A movie? Wow!

08:25.916 --> 08:28.874
I have to hang up, honey.
I'll call you back.

08:29.076 --> 08:31.067
- <i>Where are you, daddy?</i>
- At work.

08:31.476 --> 08:33.831
I'll call again.
Be good to auntie.

08:34.035 --> 08:36.345
A big kiss. I love you.

08:38.236 --> 08:40.431
First, explain the dealers
in the parking lot.

08:42.916 --> 08:44.986
Dealer-shootout-arrest...
will that do?

08:45.236 --> 08:48.546
Sure. The court lawyer is suing for
assault and battery. Will that do?

08:48.756 --> 08:50.553
Let him. What can I say?

08:51.516 --> 08:53.154
Another mess like this
and I report you.

08:54.956 --> 08:55.911
Is that clear?

09:01.315 --> 09:02.634
What do we have here?

09:02.955 --> 09:05.549
Marc Cipriani. Criminal record.
No trace of shells.

09:05.915 --> 09:08.475
Scour the area.
See if you can find a witness.

09:10.795 --> 09:12.114
Get to work.

09:18.835 --> 09:21.269
Here we go again.
Damn it!

09:26.995 --> 09:28.348
Forget about your party.

09:28.555 --> 09:30.068
Then I'll run away.

09:30.355 --> 09:32.425
If you do, I'll kill you.

10:10.074 --> 10:13.908
<i>/f //eave a message about your son,</i>
<i>you might at /east ca// back.</i>

10:15.754 --> 10:17.028
I was going to.

10:18.754 --> 10:22.827
/ <i>managed for tonight</i>
<i>but what wi// you do tomorrow?</i>

10:23.874 --> 10:26.183
I'll pick him up after judo.

10:26.394 --> 10:30.387
<i>He to/d you. /t's his first match.</i>
<i>You have to be there.</i>

10:32.314 --> 10:33.508
I'll be there.

10:34.074 --> 10:36.429
/ <i>hope so.</i>
<i>He's counting on you.</i>

10:37.474 --> 10:38.873
How's it going?

10:39.434 --> 10:40.469
<i>Okay.</i>

10:41.034 --> 10:43.389
<i>/t's at 11 o'c/ock. See you tomorrow.</i>

11:19.873 --> 11:20.988
Wake up.

11:22.153 --> 11:25.828
We make the arrest of the century
and that jerk takes credit.

11:26.073 --> 11:27.745
He's telling it in our place.

11:29.433 --> 11:31.708
- Where you going?
- Home. Alice is waiting.

11:31.953 --> 11:32.988
Stay a while.

11:33.193 --> 11:34.387
So long, guys.

11:34.593 --> 11:36.311
- Coming?
- Be right out.

11:38.393 --> 11:40.065
Go on and party, asshole.

12:00.712 --> 12:01.906
Let's go.

12:03.192 --> 12:05.103
Shit! I forgot Manon's gift.

12:06.032 --> 12:08.023
- Be right back.
- No, wait.

12:46.711 --> 12:47.746
Was he drinking?

12:50.191 --> 12:51.943
He'll be struck off
the police force.

12:52.431 --> 12:54.740
Three dead, including a child.

12:54.951 --> 12:57.340
If he tests positive,
he goes down.

13:01.551 --> 13:02.620
Simon...

13:04.071 --> 13:05.504
Can you hear me?

13:27.671 --> 13:29.741
That is a simple class exercise?

13:29.951 --> 13:31.020
Yep.

13:31.511 --> 13:32.785
Damn...

13:37.430 --> 13:38.783
Was my dad really like you?

13:38.990 --> 13:40.389
What do you mean like you?

13:40.670 --> 13:41.659
A cop.

13:42.950 --> 13:44.224
It's true. Why not?

13:45.110 --> 13:46.668
It doesn't look like it.

13:49.110 --> 13:52.022
I can assure you
he was a great cop.

13:54.830 --> 13:56.229
Did you know
the people he killed?

14:04.750 --> 14:05.739
But you know,

14:07.350 --> 14:08.624
that wasn't his fault.

14:11.230 --> 14:12.982
Then why did he go to jail?

14:18.270 --> 14:22.661
It's not always your fault
when you go to prison.

14:24.150 --> 14:26.823
Did your wife really die
when Manon was born?

14:30.310 --> 14:32.300
Who's the cop, you or me?

14:32.629 --> 14:34.347
Let's cut the questions

14:34.789 --> 14:37.826
and exercise!
I won't do everything either.

14:39.229 --> 14:41.345
Gabriel Hachour, drug dealer.

14:41.589 --> 14:43.386
Same modus operandi
as this morning.

14:43.629 --> 14:45.665
No cartridges but the same guys.

14:47.629 --> 14:48.379
Where were you?

14:53.069 --> 14:53.819
What about her?

14:54.069 --> 14:55.866
His daughter, age 14.

14:57.109 --> 14:58.462
What else do we have?

14:58.669 --> 15:00.307
The guardian heard a shot.

15:00.549 --> 15:01.982
He saw a black car.

15:02.189 --> 15:04.544
We're trying to trace tire tracks.

15:28.668 --> 15:30.067
<i>Look at yourse/f.</i>

15:30.308 --> 15:31.536
<i>You're just a ghost.</i>

15:31.868 --> 15:34.018
We've been waiting two years
for you.

15:34.788 --> 15:37.348
Right out of prison,
and you want to leave.

15:37.828 --> 15:39.261
What did you expect?

15:42.828 --> 15:44.386
What did you expect?

15:44.948 --> 15:46.540
Will this bring them back?

15:47.588 --> 15:49.465
We're alive.

15:50.108 --> 15:52.383
We're alive! We're here!

15:55.708 --> 15:56.458
Fight back.

16:02.588 --> 16:04.021
Say something.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.301
I'm sorry.

17:06.227 --> 17:07.454
He's the one who's sorry.

17:19.506 --> 17:20.621
Are you happy?

17:25.705 --> 17:27.458
I swear, it was terrific.

17:31.226 --> 17:34.059
- Make sure you get him home.
- I know. 8...

17:42.866 --> 17:43.821
Came in first?

17:44.346 --> 17:46.177
No, second.

17:47.986 --> 17:49.419
Second place is good too.

17:54.466 --> 17:55.421
Let's go.

17:57.186 --> 17:58.858
Aqualand would be nice.

17:59.066 --> 18:00.465
We've been there.

18:00.666 --> 18:03.021
You used to love the dolphins.

18:03.226 --> 18:04.102
I was only six then.

18:04.746 --> 18:06.464
Aqualand is for babies.

18:08.586 --> 18:11.054
There's a match Sunday.
We've never done one.

18:11.946 --> 18:14.665
Jean-Marc has a surprise for us.

18:25.145 --> 18:26.464
Who's Jean-Marc?

18:29.145 --> 18:31.056
Who's Jean-Marc?

18:31.985 --> 18:33.134
A friend of mom's.

18:40.585 --> 18:42.098
What's his surprise?

18:42.625 --> 18:44.422
I don't know. It's a surprise.

18:51.105 --> 18:53.096
I hope it's not Aqualand.

19:04.545 --> 19:06.103
See you Saturday.

19:15.304 --> 19:16.293
It's me.

20:05.224 --> 20:05.974
What is it?

20:07.583 --> 20:08.572
You're beautiful.

20:22.743 --> 20:23.892
It's on the table.

20:33.503 --> 20:35.778
Maybe we could
get together for real.

20:37.503 --> 20:38.379
For real?

20:38.663 --> 20:39.937
I mean

20:41.143 --> 20:41.893
go eat.

20:42.823 --> 20:43.892
I don't eat.

20:45.303 --> 20:47.533
It explains your perfect figure.

20:48.383 --> 20:51.455
What about a restaurant?

20:52.343 --> 20:54.413
At the worst, you spend a great night

20:54.663 --> 20:56.062
with a swell guy.

21:26.502 --> 21:28.732
How do you like it?
Nice surprise.

21:29.182 --> 21:30.934
Not for a child.

21:31.142 --> 21:32.700
There are lots of kids.

21:40.182 --> 21:43.618
And colors, music, animals.
Just like the circus.

21:47.702 --> 21:48.976
Where are you going?

21:49.182 --> 21:49.932
To the toilet.

21:50.382 --> 21:51.531
Stay here. Not alone.

21:51.742 --> 21:53.095
You'll miss the execution.

21:54.262 --> 21:55.012
Go to the toilet.

21:56.662 --> 21:58.299
Tell him to wait.

22:18.501 --> 22:19.251
And now?

22:20.821 --> 22:22.015
Should I go?

23:16.340 --> 23:17.773
You have to stand up.

23:46.900 --> 23:47.855
Look at him good.

23:52.779 --> 23:54.337
Are you okay, honey?

23:55.779 --> 23:56.609
Let's go.

23:56.859 --> 23:58.053
We're not finished.

23:58.299 --> 23:59.732
He's seen them all twice.

23:59.939 --> 24:00.849
Wait a second.

24:01.059 --> 24:02.777
We won't find his picture.

24:03.019 --> 24:04.816
These guys killed 5 people.

24:05.059 --> 24:05.809
First, he gets rest.

24:06.059 --> 24:07.333
He's the only witness...

24:07.579 --> 24:10.013
He's my son, he's ten,
and he's going to rest.

24:16.539 --> 24:18.291
First thing in the morning.

24:18.619 --> 24:20.655
Do you know
where those guys come from?

24:21.499 --> 24:22.978
Susini, what are you doing?

24:23.779 --> 24:26.054
What do you do
for their protection?

24:26.299 --> 24:27.448
Get a team together.

24:27.699 --> 24:29.132
I'm the one who decides that.

24:29.379 --> 24:32.052
Now get lost,
and let the police work.

24:32.579 --> 24:33.329
I didn't hear that.

24:35.019 --> 24:35.769
Don't touch me.

24:36.819 --> 24:38.218
Fuck off, dickhead!

24:41.099 --> 24:41.849
Fuck off where?

24:44.659 --> 24:46.091
Close the door.

24:47.538 --> 24:48.653
Get off me too.

24:59.218 --> 25:00.128
I'll take you home.

25:00.738 --> 25:03.411
- No, we'll manage.
- I'll take you home.

25:03.618 --> 25:04.937
I said, no.

25:05.378 --> 25:08.131
Your son needs rest
and not hollering.

25:08.578 --> 25:11.490
So calm down
and with dignity for once.

26:05.937 --> 26:07.290
I want you to rest.

26:07.497 --> 26:08.247
Let's go.

26:22.257 --> 26:23.087
Théo...

26:23.457 --> 26:24.287
come on.

26:36.417 --> 26:37.531
Don't move!

26:43.136 --> 26:44.205
Get down!

26:45.656 --> 26:47.294
Théo, duck!

26:59.176 --> 27:00.131
Théo, run for it!

27:15.616 --> 27:16.366
Run!

27:27.776 --> 27:28.686
Don't move!

32:10.051 --> 32:12.439
We'll get out of here.
Don't worry.

32:15.250 --> 32:16.126
Hide!

32:31.610 --> 32:32.645
Daddy!

33:23.929 --> 33:25.362
Stop it, Simon!

33:25.849 --> 33:28.158
Stop it, for chrissake!

33:29.889 --> 33:31.288
Come on.

33:40.129 --> 33:41.278
You okay?

33:42.889 --> 33:44.083
Where's your son?

33:57.089 --> 33:58.283
We're in the old market.

33:58.489 --> 33:59.524
Are you okay?

34:26.288 --> 34:27.562
Are you okay?

34:36.208 --> 34:37.880
Frank, come here.

34:39.728 --> 34:43.322
Find a safe place for the night.
We can't take any risks.

34:43.527 --> 34:45.405
I'll take them to my place.

34:46.047 --> 34:47.527
I want Jacquet with you
all the time.

34:47.728 --> 34:49.922
Jacquet, you watch the witnesses.

34:50.608 --> 34:53.327
I want to see him
as soon as he can talk.

35:02.327 --> 35:03.123
You're not hurt?

35:13.767 --> 35:14.756
He's okay.

35:36.327 --> 35:37.840
Will you sleep with me?

35:38.247 --> 35:40.283
Yes, but not right now.

35:42.767 --> 35:44.041
Daddy's gone?

35:47.767 --> 35:49.325
He's still here.

35:50.687 --> 35:53.326
Don't worry. He'll come to see you.

35:55.486 --> 35:56.555
Good night.

36:24.806 --> 36:26.364
He's waiting for you.

36:48.606 --> 36:49.958
Where's your daughter?

36:50.605 --> 36:52.084
At my sister's in Paris.

36:53.285 --> 36:54.604
She left for a week.

36:56.885 --> 36:59.274
It's your longest separation.

37:10.205 --> 37:10.955
Don't.

37:12.645 --> 37:13.839
What's wrong?

37:16.565 --> 37:18.237
Better you don't stay here.

37:21.125 --> 37:22.114
Okay.

37:24.525 --> 37:25.514
I'll call you.

37:33.805 --> 37:34.794
I'm sorry.

37:57.724 --> 37:59.077
Why would they hurt me?

38:02.324 --> 38:04.394
You saw something
you shouldn't have.

38:07.084 --> 38:08.563
Think they'll come back?

38:11.644 --> 38:13.157
They won't come again.

38:20.964 --> 38:21.874
Get some sleep.

38:29.964 --> 38:30.714
Daddy?

38:34.044 --> 38:35.762
Did you also practice judo?

38:41.164 --> 38:42.596
But a long time ago.

38:47.603 --> 38:48.479
Good night.

39:04.003 --> 39:06.471
- Sure you won't stay here?
- No, I'm going.

39:21.483 --> 39:22.313
Take care of them.

39:22.803 --> 39:24.236
I'm counting on you.

40:02.162 --> 40:03.595
Working nights now?

40:22.242 --> 40:22.992
What do you want?

41:10.001 --> 41:11.753
What the hell are you doing here?

41:15.761 --> 41:16.511
Get in.

41:49.600 --> 41:50.919
I'm coming with you.

41:51.560 --> 41:53.551
We'll take 'em on
like we used to.

41:58.040 --> 41:59.632
Why are you doing all this?

42:04.760 --> 42:05.954
All this what?

42:07.560 --> 42:09.073
Being here for me.

42:16.320 --> 42:17.992
I'm going it alone this time.

42:43.879 --> 42:45.232
What's your game?

42:47.639 --> 42:48.788
You're under arrest.

42:58.359 --> 43:00.111
You won't make it on your own.

43:10.879 --> 43:12.107
Nice of you to visit.

43:12.359 --> 43:13.712
Pastor sent me.

43:13.919 --> 43:16.558
I have better things to do
than keep you company.

43:17.919 --> 43:19.352
Is he awake?

43:19.559 --> 43:22.948
And what with your pal gave him
he'll be sleeping a while.

43:23.278 --> 43:25.473
I have time to buy you coffee.

43:26.558 --> 43:27.832
We're up for a coffee.

43:28.078 --> 43:29.909
- You're on duty till when?
- 6:00.

43:30.878 --> 43:31.628
I hate nights.

43:35.198 --> 43:36.631
Make mine a short coffee.

43:36.998 --> 43:39.387
- It's no good.
- It rarely is.

44:00.398 --> 44:01.626
See this bubble?

44:03.478 --> 44:05.469
When it reaches your brain,
you're done for.

44:06.638 --> 44:07.832
Understand?

44:11.158 --> 44:11.908
Watch out.

44:12.438 --> 44:14.156
You hit the "soup" button.

44:17.277 --> 44:20.189
Coffee makes me edgy at night.

44:25.997 --> 44:28.591
Why are you and your friends here?

44:32.917 --> 44:34.350
Why did you come here?

44:47.317 --> 44:48.750
We came to do business.

44:48.957 --> 44:50.436
What kind?

44:50.637 --> 44:51.467
Heroine and girls.

44:52.477 --> 44:53.796
And my son?

44:54.277 --> 44:55.027
Still in danger?

44:55.717 --> 44:58.948
He saw us. Milan never takes risks.

45:01.277 --> 45:02.756
Where can I find Milan?

45:04.957 --> 45:05.707
I don't know.

45:10.997 --> 45:12.429
Where can I find Milan?

45:18.916 --> 45:19.666
I don't know.

45:22.196 --> 45:23.026
Stop!

45:24.396 --> 45:25.909
They meet tonight in a club.

45:26.156 --> 45:26.986
Which club?

45:27.196 --> 45:28.185
The Why Not.

45:29.876 --> 45:31.389
I mean it, I'm not lying.

45:36.316 --> 45:37.271
Wait...

45:37.756 --> 45:39.951
Milan will realize
that I talked.

45:40.156 --> 45:41.874
Protect me or I'm dead.

45:44.996 --> 45:46.224
You're dead.

45:51.636 --> 45:52.751
To your health.

45:53.716 --> 45:55.115
Here, I doubt it.

45:57.596 --> 45:58.745
Health...

46:00.956 --> 46:03.026
Sure, hospital... health...

46:04.636 --> 46:06.308
That was a good one.

46:06.556 --> 46:08.546
- I knew you'd like it.
- Funny cop.

46:11.515 --> 46:12.311
It's my cell.

46:13.475 --> 46:14.271
I'm so sorry.

46:14.475 --> 46:15.225
It's scalding hot.

46:15.435 --> 46:16.629
Sure, it is.

46:16.835 --> 46:18.666
You should take it off.

46:18.915 --> 46:20.268
Look, it's all red.

46:20.555 --> 46:21.749
Don't spread it.

46:21.955 --> 46:23.274
Now you burned me.

46:23.475 --> 46:25.306
- I'll pay for the cleaning.
- Even a shirt.

46:25.515 --> 46:27.028
I wouldn't go so far.

46:27.595 --> 46:29.665
- Sure, it's a nice shirt.
- A nice make over.

46:40.995 --> 46:41.950
What's this club?

46:42.195 --> 46:44.072
It's also a brothel.

46:50.115 --> 46:51.025
Is that them?

46:51.715 --> 46:52.830
Looks like them.

46:53.715 --> 46:54.670
Stay in the car.

46:54.915 --> 46:56.906
Why is it always me?

46:57.195 --> 46:58.787
Because I'm your big brother.

46:59.075 --> 47:01.031
- I'm coming along tonight.
- No.

47:01.275 --> 47:02.674
I have a bullet-proof vest.

47:05.954 --> 47:07.546
Fuck you.

47:07.834 --> 47:09.233
You stupid turd.

47:35.474 --> 47:36.270
Come with me.

47:38.154 --> 47:39.303
Stay here and watch the door.

47:39.514 --> 47:40.390
Okay.

48:34.633 --> 48:35.702
Sit down.

48:42.753 --> 48:44.311
Can't you serve drinks?

49:20.712 --> 49:22.942
I'm busy with the gentleman. Later.

49:27.272 --> 49:29.024
I'm not available.

49:31.312 --> 49:32.222
Shit, they're cops.

49:32.672 --> 49:34.264
I know that guy.

50:05.511 --> 50:06.387
Are they yours?

50:13.951 --> 50:14.827
Take a look.

50:16.031 --> 50:16.907
Move it!

52:06.029 --> 52:07.018
I'm okay.

54:26.427 --> 54:27.382
Go ahead.

56:29.464 --> 56:30.214
Drop your gun!

56:35.584 --> 56:36.414
Drop your gun.

56:36.624 --> 56:37.534
Shut up and drop it.

56:41.304 --> 56:42.453
Drop it!

56:48.464 --> 56:49.499
Drop your gun!

57:06.824 --> 57:08.098
Let's get outta here.

57:40.543 --> 57:42.261
My brother.

58:12.822 --> 58:15.814
Pastor's no genius,
but he'll make the connections.

58:16.062 --> 58:17.620
You have to lie low.

58:18.142 --> 58:19.177
We have to find them.

58:19.422 --> 58:21.299
Not with Pastor on your back.

58:21.982 --> 58:23.938
Alice and Théo have to leave town.

58:24.702 --> 58:26.101
And the jerk at your place?

58:27.822 --> 58:29.619
I forgot about Jacquet.

58:34.822 --> 58:36.175
I said, go easy.

58:39.262 --> 58:40.411
You're crazy.

59:02.982 --> 59:04.700
It's the right thing to do.

59:06.142 --> 59:08.701
My sister can take you in,
you have to leave.

59:08.941 --> 59:10.215
You have to leave now.

59:23.541 --> 59:24.894
Trust me.

59:30.221 --> 59:31.813
Why don't you come with us?

59:32.061 --> 59:33.813
Because I am.

59:36.861 --> 59:38.294
I won't leave you alone.

59:49.701 --> 59:51.692
We've been alone for years.

01:00:02.701 --> 01:00:03.815
I'll get Théo ready.

01:00:34.540 --> 01:00:36.895
Why kill the kid now?
Everybody's seen us.

01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:39.251
Screw the kid.

01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:40.974
It's them I want.

01:00:41.740 --> 01:00:43.856
I brought you
but I won't be involved.

01:00:44.220 --> 01:00:44.970
Get rid of her.

01:01:26.019 --> 01:01:26.929
Thanks.

01:02:18.098 --> 01:02:19.167
Be right back.

01:02:21.698 --> 01:02:22.448
Where you going?

01:02:22.698 --> 01:02:24.290
To get a bite to eat.

01:02:38.698 --> 01:02:40.051
<i>This is Simon's voicemai/...</i>

01:02:41.938 --> 01:02:43.132
Can you call that TGV?

01:02:44.418 --> 01:02:45.567
Can you call the train?

01:02:45.818 --> 01:02:47.171
With the tunnels,
not before 10 minutes.

01:02:47.498 --> 01:02:49.136
- The next stop?
- Aix.

01:02:51.577 --> 01:02:53.295
You let them beat you up?

01:02:56.457 --> 01:02:57.856
Where are they now?

01:02:58.057 --> 01:02:59.012
At his sister's.

01:02:59.257 --> 01:03:01.168
You know the sister?

01:03:02.457 --> 01:03:03.606
You don't?

01:03:19.577 --> 01:03:21.568
<i>No network avai/ab/e</i>

01:03:32.017 --> 01:03:33.609
I got you a coffee.

01:03:48.296 --> 01:03:49.615
What's this mess at the Why Not?

01:03:49.856 --> 01:03:51.050
There are more important things.

01:03:51.296 --> 01:03:53.651
Listen.
Get your ass down here now...

01:03:53.856 --> 01:03:54.606
<i>You /isten!</i>

01:03:54.856 --> 01:03:56.972
Send a team to block the TGV Aix...

01:03:57.216 --> 01:03:58.854
- No, you listen.
- <i>Shut up!</i>

01:03:59.096 --> 01:04:01.212
Simon's family is on board
along with the killers.

01:04:01.616 --> 01:04:05.006
<i>For once in your /ife,</i>
<i>do your job, assho/e.</i>

01:04:10.736 --> 01:04:11.691
What?

01:04:22.256 --> 01:04:24.167
Look downstairs,
we'll look up here.

01:05:33.255 --> 01:05:34.404
You all right, mister?

01:05:40.734 --> 01:05:42.213
Get out, please.

01:05:51.974 --> 01:05:53.293
Tickets, please.

01:05:56.214 --> 01:05:57.693
Sorry, no tickets.

01:05:57.894 --> 01:05:59.930
That will be two fines.

01:06:00.334 --> 01:06:03.849
2 adults, plus 58 euros per person.

01:06:04.054 --> 01:06:05.772
For a total of 286 euros.

01:06:06.214 --> 01:06:08.364
You're lucky
I put you in second class.

01:06:29.534 --> 01:06:31.126
Simon, they're on the train.

01:06:33.933 --> 01:06:35.252
Get down.

01:06:41.293 --> 01:06:42.806
What's that?
Come on.

01:07:04.213 --> 01:07:04.963
Get him out!

01:07:05.213 --> 01:07:06.362
Go!

01:07:21.893 --> 01:07:23.121
Upstairs!

01:07:44.572 --> 01:07:45.322
Get down.

01:08:11.332 --> 01:08:13.050
<i>Our train has stopped on the tracks.</i>

01:08:13.292 --> 01:08:15.123
<i>P/ease don't open the doors.</i>

01:08:46.291 --> 01:08:47.406
Come on,

01:08:47.611 --> 01:08:48.441
climb over.

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:52.919
Come out.

01:10:06.010 --> 01:10:06.999
Downstairs!

01:10:11.570 --> 01:10:13.128
It's open, follow me.

01:10:27.129 --> 01:10:28.608
Get out!

01:10:58.929 --> 01:10:59.884
Thierry?

01:12:41.967 --> 01:12:43.446
Run, Théo!

01:12:44.167 --> 01:12:45.122
Mommy!

01:13:04.606 --> 01:13:06.244
You okay, Simon?

01:13:07.206 --> 01:13:08.639
Look at me. You okay?

01:13:09.526 --> 01:13:11.596
Alice and Théo, run for it.

01:13:29.846 --> 01:13:30.915
Let go!

01:14:11.245 --> 01:14:12.724
Everything's all right.

01:15:44.444 --> 01:15:45.274
Let go!

01:15:46.324 --> 01:15:47.882
What are you doing?

01:15:50.244 --> 01:15:52.677
If you don't let go, you'll die too.

01:15:53.483 --> 01:15:54.802
What the fuck are you doing?

01:15:55.243 --> 01:15:57.837
You'll get us both killed.

01:15:58.083 --> 01:15:59.277
You're gonna die!

01:16:49.562 --> 01:16:50.961
It will be all right.

01:17:03.202 --> 01:17:04.681
I'm sorry.

01:17:32.402 --> 01:17:33.801
Let's go.

01:17:35.322 --> 01:17:37.199
Shit, I forgot Manon's gift.

01:17:38.042 --> 01:17:39.521
- Be right back.
- No, wait.

01:19:34.800 --> 01:19:35.951
I thought you were dead.

01:19:41.535 --> 01:19:42.766
I'm sorry.

01:20:27.402 --> 01:20:29.797
Frank Vasseur
has joined the long list

01:20:30.008 --> 01:20:31.890
of officers killed on duty.

01:20:32.093 --> 01:20:33.895
Men like you and me.

01:20:34.098 --> 01:20:36.618
We choose to serve and protect

01:20:37.225 --> 01:20:39.870
without worrying about the risks.

01:20:40.994 --> 01:20:44.199
We don't become policemen by chance
but by conviction.

01:20:44.723 --> 01:20:46.159
Today we honor the man,

01:20:46.727 --> 01:20:49.247
the colleague
and most of all the friend.

01:20:49.815 --> 01:20:51.775
Those who knew him
will tell his daughter

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:54.819
about the policeman of valor,
the man of conviction,

01:20:56.069 --> 01:20:58.909
and most of all the model father.

01:21:00.600 --> 01:21:01.637
Goodbye, Frank.
