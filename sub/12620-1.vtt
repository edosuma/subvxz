Barnabus.

1:19:32.720 --> 1:19:37.280
Hello, Mike.  I just stopped by
to let you know the federation
handed down its ruling.

1:19:37.320 --> 1:19:41.480
<i>Your initial transmission</i>
<i>is being deemed accidental,</i>

1:19:41.560 --> 1:19:45.160
and Earth is classified
again as a protected planet
under federation statutes.

1:19:45.200 --> 1:19:48.120
That’s a relief.
I guess the world is saved.

1:19:48.160 --> 1:19:52.720
And the Thoad has been
sentenced to serve two aeons
in a federation penitentiary.

1:19:52.800 --> 1:19:55.520
His hostages have been
returned to their home planets.

1:19:55.600 --> 1:20:00.480
- And the Hanzel ?
- He’s safe and grateful
for all you did.

1:20:00.520 --> 1:20:03.880
All’s well that ends well,
as the saying goes.

1:20:03.960 --> 1:20:07.640
I don’t know what to say.

1:20:07.720 --> 1:20:10.160
Thank you
for everything, Barnabus.

1:20:10.200 --> 1:20:14.960

I know you would be happy,
and so would I.

1:20:26.400 --> 1:20:30.840
I don’t think so, Barnabus.
Earth is my home.

1:20:30.920 --> 1:20:36.000
And even though
it doesn’t always feel like it,
I guess it’s where I belong.

Many here who feel out of place
point their heads down.
But not you, Mike Pillsbury.

you’ve shown me there’s
something to be said...
