then to the world and then to...

12:42.511 --> 12:45.806
outer space!

12:46.015 --> 12:48.392
Whoo!

12:48.476 --> 12:50.644
[coughs] Whoo!

12:53.772 --> 12:58.277
Um, Your Majesty? Ted here. You know
that thing you did with the Booty Doodles?

12:58.360 --> 13:00.905
How you replaced all the food
in the kingdom with the bars?

13:01.238 --> 13:02.615
Wow, what a hit!

13:02.823 --> 13:04.950
People will remember that for years!

13:05.159 --> 13:08.537
Well, they're gone. They're gone!
All of 'em are gone.

13:08.787 --> 13:11.123
We're out of Booty Doodles!

13:11.207 --> 13:13.459
We're starving and we're all gonna d--

13:13.667 --> 13:14.627
Save it, Willie!

13:15.294 --> 13:19.757
Relax, my peoples! I gotcha covered.
We could feed you guys, like, forevs.

13:19.924 --> 13:22.635
Got mountains of Booty Doodles
stored up in our supply room...

13:22.801 --> 13:24.720
[grumbling]

13:25.471 --> 13:27.181
[all] Huh?

13:27.264 --> 13:31.477
[Clover] You! You did this to me,
Your Majesty!

13:31.560 --> 13:33.270
And it can't be undone!

13:33.729 --> 13:37.107
Shut the door! Get me more Booty Doodles!

13:37.483 --> 13:40.819
Don't look at me! Don't look at me!

13:41.946 --> 13:45.241
Okay, so, Clover's not here right now...

13:46.867 --> 13:49.036
What's going on? Guys?

13:49.119 --> 13:53.415
Don't worry, everybody!
We'll just make more bars!

13:53.582 --> 13:55.543
Alright, you geckos! You got this!

13:55.960 --> 13:58.337
Looking great, Marty! I mean, really--

13:58.420 --> 14:00.923
Kathy, your eyes, fabulous!

14:01.006 --> 14:04.510
Jonathan, you've got a great...
personality!

14:04.593 --> 14:05.886
Yeah! Nothing can stop you!

14:06.178 --> 14:07.263
[squeaking]

14:09.765 --> 14:12.476
[laughs] Uh... Hmm?

14:13.269 --> 14:17.022
Okay so, we're having some technical
difficulties here,

14:17.106 --> 14:19.525
just go back to your normal lemur lives

14:19.608 --> 14:22.444
and we'll bring you some more
doodles a bit later. Okay, thanks!

14:22.528 --> 14:25.114
-Oh, this is great.
-Bye-bye now. Bye, we'll see you.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.741
-Mort?
-Present!

14:27.825 --> 14:30.661
We need a refill.
What kinda stuff was in that barrel?

14:30.744 --> 14:33.873
I dunno. Grammy never told me!

14:33.956 --> 14:35.833
Think, Mort! Think!

14:35.958 --> 14:40.170
Oh! I can't remember!
That was like fifty years ago!

14:40.254 --> 14:42.840
Okay, first, how old are you?

14:43.173 --> 14:45.092
Second, figure it out. Pronto!

14:45.676 --> 14:48.929
Oh! Come on, Mortdecai,
your king needs you!

14:49.013 --> 14:52.308
Grammy, you gotta help me!
What was in those bars?

14:52.516 --> 14:54.226
I'll never tell!

14:54.310 --> 14:55.603
[laughs]

14:55.686 --> 14:58.230
Come on, Grammy! It's for my king!

14:58.397 --> 15:02.818
Check the wishing well.
That's where the secrets are buried!

15:02.902 --> 15:03.736
[laughs]

15:03.861 --> 15:05.362
[sobbing]

15:06.280 --> 15:08.490
Just tell me, you crazy old woman!

15:09.909 --> 15:11.744
-[grunts]
-Mort! Get it together!

15:11.827 --> 15:14.079
I will find the ingredients, Your Majesty!

15:14.163 --> 15:15.080
I promise!

15:15.205 --> 15:16.373
[shouting]

15:26.842 --> 15:28.052
This looks okay, right?

15:36.101 --> 15:37.645
Oh! These should work!

15:41.315 --> 15:42.191
[Mort grunts]

15:52.952 --> 15:53.953
[Mort shouting]

15:55.579 --> 15:57.289
[straining]

16:04.296 --> 16:06.298
[Mort moaning]

16:08.133 --> 16:10.928
I did it... my king.

16:19.311 --> 16:21.313
Oh, yeah! Back in business!

16:21.397 --> 16:22.856
[laughs]

16:27.528 --> 16:29.071
[Mort grunting]

16:32.741 --> 16:37.746
Our Booty Doodles are back
and King Julien saved us all!

16:40.040 --> 16:41.250
[humming]

16:47.381 --> 16:48.465
L'chaim!

16:50.551 --> 16:51.552
[all grunt]

16:53.679 --> 16:54.638
Wha--

16:55.389 --> 16:56.598
Huh?

16:56.682 --> 16:57.933
Umm...

16:58.475 --> 17:00.019
Did you feel that, Dorothy?

17:04.773 --> 17:09.278
Todd! Baby, what happened? Come to mama!

17:15.159 --> 17:18.579
Hold on tight, my little babies!

17:18.662 --> 17:20.873
Come on, man!

17:20.956 --> 17:21.915
[straining]

17:22.541 --> 17:27.254
Todd! I'm comin', baby!

17:31.216 --> 17:32.384
[screaming]

17:34.678 --> 17:35.888
[screaming]

17:37.389 --> 17:38.640
[screaming]

17:38.724 --> 17:42.227
Huh! I didn't know Willie could fly.
Did ya see? Mo!

17:42.311 --> 17:44.396
Booty Doodles really
doin' wonders for him.

17:44.480 --> 17:47.024
Your Majesty?
Willie's not the only one flyin'!

17:47.107 --> 17:48.525
Incoming!

17:48.609 --> 17:49.902
-[screaming]
-Oh, hey, Jeffrey!

17:49.985 --> 17:52.237
Where are they goin' in such a hurry?

17:52.321 --> 17:54.406
The lemurs are getting
sucked to that giant ball!

17:56.784 --> 17:59.161
We gotta get outta here,
Your Majesty! Run!

17:59.495 --> 18:00.954
-[screaming]
-[grunting]

18:02.748 --> 18:06.460
I'm trying, Mo-Mo! It's so strong!

18:07.419 --> 18:10.422
I don't know what's happening
right now, Maurice,

18:10.964 --> 18:13.425
but this seems like your fault!

18:13.675 --> 18:14.510
What?

18:15.094 --> 18:16.053
[screaming]

18:20.349 --> 18:24.645
Thanks for sacrificing yourself
to save me, Mo-Mo!

18:24.728 --> 18:26.146
Whoa!

18:26.355 --> 18:27.940
[screaming]

18:31.819 --> 18:34.321
[Timo] In the shower! No clothes!

18:34.696 --> 18:35.864
[Timo screaming]

18:39.368 --> 18:43.288
What in Frank's name was in that
new batch of ingredients, Mort?

18:43.372 --> 18:50.129
That was in it! [laughs]
"M-A-G-N-E-T-S." Candy!

18:50.212 --> 18:52.881
That wasn't candy, Mort!
Those are magnets!

18:53.882 --> 18:56.552
Twigs and berries! Incoming!

18:58.804 --> 19:00.139
Not in the money maker!

19:03.433 --> 19:04.893
Oh, my!

19:04.977 --> 19:07.104
It appears all of the lemurs
have been magnetized

19:07.187 --> 19:09.606
and are now stuck to
all of this metal junk!

19:09.731 --> 19:14.027
[mocking] "Oh, yes, it appears,
magnetized..." Can you fix it?

19:14.111 --> 19:16.238
[straining] Um, no.

19:16.780 --> 19:19.741
[sobbing] It's over!

19:19.825 --> 19:23.662
I dunno, this doesn't seem so bad.
It's kinda cozy, really!

19:23.745 --> 19:26.415
Grandma's fanny pack, that was close!

19:27.457 --> 19:28.709
My peoples...

19:28.834 --> 19:31.170
what have I done?

19:31.753 --> 19:33.297
[Julien sobbing]

19:35.966 --> 19:37.634
[Julien] What have I done?

19:38.010 --> 19:40.679
[Julien's voice echoing]

19:41.221 --> 19:44.892
Hold on, Your Majesty! I'll save you!

19:45.225 --> 19:46.226
[grunts]

19:48.854 --> 19:52.149
[panting, babbling, straining]

19:53.901 --> 19:55.402
[screaming]

19:56.612 --> 19:57.696
Whoa!

19:58.864 --> 20:00.240
What's happening?

20:00.324 --> 20:01.283
Whoa!

20:01.366 --> 20:02.993
Why am I not sticking...

20:03.118 --> 20:04.077
Whoa!

20:04.161 --> 20:05.162
...to you guys?

20:05.370 --> 20:07.372
Clover! Save us!

20:07.456 --> 20:10.292
I'm trying, Your Majesty!

20:10.667 --> 20:15.047
Oh, look at Clover. She's built up an
equal but opposite negative charge!

20:15.255 --> 20:17.507
If only she could build up
enough velocity...

20:17.591 --> 20:21.136
She could slam into us and nullify
the magnetic effect, man.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.555
Break us all apart and whatnot.

20:23.639 --> 20:26.099
Do what they said, Clover! Hurry!

20:26.808 --> 20:28.143
[straining]

20:28.352 --> 20:30.896

20:31.813 --> 20:33.190
-[rumbling]
-[screaming]

20:33.273 --> 20:34.942
What-- What's happening?

20:37.861 --> 20:41.657
Oh, no! Now we're getting sucked
into the moon's gravitational pull!

20:41.740 --> 20:44.660
I didn't think any of this
was scientifically possible!

20:45.452 --> 20:47.329
Whoa! Whoa!

20:49.248 --> 20:51.833
What have I done?

20:51.917 --> 20:52.876
[bawling]

20:54.253 --> 20:56.713
I've let myself down...

20:57.214 --> 20:58.507
and worse...

20:58.966 --> 21:01.885
I've let my king down.

21:05.138 --> 21:06.682
Come on, Clover!

21:06.890 --> 21:08.225
Don't be a wimp!

21:08.809 --> 21:10.394
Move it, soldier!

21:10.978 --> 21:11.853
[bawling]

21:12.646 --> 21:13.981
Move it!

21:19.903 --> 21:23.115
For my king!

21:26.201 --> 21:28.495
One step...

21:29.121 --> 21:32.874
at a... time.

21:36.628 --> 21:38.255
[grunting]

21:38.338 --> 21:40.799
[panting]

21:40.882 --> 21:43.093
[Julien] Goodbye, my peoples!

21:43.927 --> 21:45.721
I want you all to know

21:46.054 --> 21:50.267
that I have not learned
from this experience at all!

21:51.226 --> 21:52.394
On it!

21:54.980 --> 21:55.981
[grunts]

21:58.066 --> 21:59.276
Whoa!

21:59.359 --> 22:01.778
I'm coming, Your Majesty!

22:02.529 --> 22:04.323
Clover Slam!

-[Mort screaming]
-[Clover grunts]

22:16.251 --> 22:17.461
Well, that wasn't so bad.

22:17.878 --> 22:20.172
-Who's hungry?
-Here we go again.

22:21.006 --> 22:24.301
I suppose a little snack
might do me right.

22:27.220 --> 22:28.847
[lemurs screaming]

22:30.474 --> 22:32.726
Sweet gherkins! We survived!

22:32.809 --> 22:33.810
[grunts]

22:33.894 --> 22:39.149
That Clover, she funny, man.
Just like that lemur clown.
