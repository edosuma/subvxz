Okay.

48:10.621 --> 48:11.856
So you think meth?

48:11.923 --> 48:13.358
Or crack or something.

48:13.424 --> 48:16.661
Tyler doesn't do
those kind of drugs, okay?
I know him.

48:16.727 --> 48:18.863
He was just shitfaced.

48:18.930 --> 48:21.199
Okay,
well, what was he drinking?

Don't say anything
until your parents
get here, Colin.

You're not in any trouble,
okay?

48:29.340 --> 48:31.642
Just, I need to know
what happened.

48:33.511 --> 48:35.746
He was drinking moonshine.

48:35.813 --> 48:37.648
You know, from up there.

48:39.985 --> 48:42.153
You mean Shay Mountain?

50:14.112 --> 50:15.380

Oh, I think meth.

50:18.283 --> 50:21.919
Probably just some cheap dirt
from a one-step.

50:21.986 --> 50:23.354

he got the stuff?

talked to the kid yet.

50:25.123 --> 50:27.192
I mean,
he's in the hospital anyway,

50:28.326 --> 50:29.827

I mean, what in God's name
are you talking about?

50:45.276 --> 50:47.678
Get them off that mountain?

50:47.745 --> 50:49.880

last a winter up there?

No money, no microwave,
no convenience store.

50:55.286 --> 50:58.156

we can't get them
off that mountain.

They know things
the name of which we
can't even remember.

They know how to
stick together.
They're a family.

the tougher they're gonna get.

any of that, Wade.
