00:35.035 --> 00:36.119
<i>What's your name?</i>

00:43.793 --> 00:45.545
<i>What's your real name?</i>

01:04.731 --> 01:05.815
Relay my message.

01:40.683 --> 01:42.060
I don't need a lawyer.

01:45.730 --> 01:47.232
I'm not here to represent you.

01:51.277 --> 01:53.363
Mr. Choi asked me to relay a message.

01:57.242 --> 01:59.369
I will not let you go to prison.

02:03.665 --> 02:04.707
Come to me.

02:15.218 --> 02:16.386
You were hurt badly.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.228
My client needs medical attention.

02:25.311 --> 02:26.187
Medical attention?

02:27.105 --> 02:29.899
Our captain is still unconscious.

02:30.567 --> 02:32.318
Should I submit a formal complaint?

02:32.402 --> 02:34.696
Worry about yourself first
before your client.

02:35.530 --> 02:37.365
You should cut your losses.

02:38.658 --> 02:42.203
Bring me documents on Dongcheon,
and we'll request mitigation.

02:42.287 --> 02:45.290
The reporters seem to be curious
about what happened.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.670
If we say there was a mole
Dongcheon planted within Narcotics,

02:51.588 --> 02:52.922
that would be breaking news.

03:38.635 --> 03:40.178
<i>She left for the hospital.</i>

03:46.059 --> 03:46.893
Bring her.

03:48.311 --> 03:49.270
-Yes, sir.
-Yes, sir.

04:46.494 --> 04:53.459
WARD 15

04:58.256 --> 04:59.090
Captain?

05:00.091 --> 05:01.050
<i>Pildo.</i>

05:04.262 --> 05:06.014
I'm at the hospital. I'll come right over.

05:06.973 --> 05:08.808
-Is he awake?
-Yes.

05:08.891 --> 05:09.976
-I'll be right back.
-Sure.

05:10.059 --> 05:10.935
Okay.

05:19.402 --> 05:20.445
Please, bear it.

05:20.528 --> 05:21.779
Miss.

05:29.871 --> 05:30.872
Help me.

05:52.393 --> 05:53.770
Please cut.

05:54.562 --> 05:55.438
Okay.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.529
Get me the dressing band.

06:04.614 --> 06:05.698
The band.

06:06.282 --> 06:07.575
Sorry. I'll go get it.

06:29.138 --> 06:31.015
Hello? Yes, professor.

06:31.099 --> 06:33.267
I checked on him this morning.

06:33.351 --> 06:35.895
He looked really bad.

06:35.978 --> 06:37.105
He was very septic,

06:37.188 --> 06:42.193
had a high fever, and his CRP level was
between five and ten.

06:42.276 --> 06:43.861
So we got a CT scan.

06:43.945 --> 06:46.864
I took a look at it,
and it looked very bad.

06:46.948 --> 06:50.368
As you said it could be endocytosis,
I thought it may be better

06:50.451 --> 06:51.661
to just operate instead.

06:51.744 --> 06:54.664
So I scheduled it
for the afternoon surgery.

06:55.832 --> 06:56.666
Captain.

06:57.834 --> 06:58.793
Are you all right?

07:00.795 --> 07:01.629
Hey.

07:02.630 --> 07:03.965
I almost died.

07:05.508 --> 07:07.844
-Do you want some water?
-I'm all right.

07:11.931 --> 07:13.057
Detective Oh--

07:13.141 --> 07:14.267
We caught her.

07:15.017 --> 07:17.478
She's the one who stabbed you, right?
She's in the hospital--

07:17.562 --> 07:18.479
Pildo.

07:20.648 --> 07:21.524
Yes?

07:28.281 --> 07:29.115
You know…

07:31.159 --> 07:32.452
Yoon Donghoon, don't you?

07:33.703 --> 07:35.121
Yoon Donghoon of Dongcheon

07:36.289 --> 07:37.915
who was murdered five years ago?

07:37.999 --> 07:38.833
Yes.

07:39.500 --> 07:40.418
Detective Oh is…

07:42.795 --> 07:44.464
Yoon Donghoon's daughter.

07:59.228 --> 08:02.190
Yoon Donghoon's real name was Song Joonsu.

08:04.692 --> 08:05.526
Wait.

08:06.652 --> 08:09.572
Do you mean
the Narcotics detective that died…

08:13.159 --> 08:14.619
He was undercover.

08:17.455 --> 08:19.457
I sent him into Dongcheon.

08:24.754 --> 08:28.132
I think it would be best
and scheduled it for this afternoon.

08:28.216 --> 08:31.093
So he'll be going into surgery
this afternoon.

08:31.177 --> 08:32.345
Yes.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.806
You don't need to worry.

08:35.890 --> 08:37.475
Well, just in case…

08:37.558 --> 08:39.685
I'm almost done here.

08:39.769 --> 08:42.897
Once I finish, I'll check on him again.

08:43.856 --> 08:45.900
Yes.

08:50.404 --> 08:52.615
<i>Jung Taeju is the one who stabbed me.</i>

08:54.283 --> 08:55.785
<i>I brought him home last night.</i>

08:56.536 --> 08:58.746
He seemed nervous,
so I offered to stay with him, but…

09:00.873 --> 09:02.291
It wasn't your fault.

09:05.795 --> 09:06.796
<i>So it was Gangjae.</i>

09:07.922 --> 09:09.465
The person you wanted to catch.

09:11.801 --> 09:14.178
You're doing this
because of your father, right?

09:16.514 --> 09:17.682
<i>Jiwoo</i>

09:18.766 --> 09:21.852
joined her dad's killer to get revenge.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.066
<i>Choi Mujin deceived her.</i>

09:31.612 --> 09:32.822
<i>If I tell you,</i>

09:34.949 --> 09:36.367
would you believe me?

09:38.286 --> 09:39.120
Pildo.

09:41.872 --> 09:43.040
Thank you for everything.

09:52.091 --> 09:53.426
Please finish up.

09:53.509 --> 09:54.343
Okay.

09:58.556 --> 10:00.516
-Are you done?
-She'll be out soon.

10:00.600 --> 10:01.517
Thank you.

10:08.774 --> 10:11.235
Take the side door and go down to B2.

10:11.944 --> 10:13.321
My car's there.

10:31.547 --> 10:32.632
I'm fine with this.

10:33.591 --> 10:34.967
I wanted to beat you anyway.

10:57.198 --> 10:59.158
-Hello?
-<i>Pildo.</i>

10:59.867 --> 11:01.369
<i>Hyejin got away.</i>

12:18.988 --> 12:20.156
Song Jiwoo!

12:27.538 --> 12:29.331
Let go!

12:30.833 --> 12:31.792
Song Jiwoo.

12:33.002 --> 12:34.253
That's your name, isn't it?

12:38.674 --> 12:39.800
What do you plan to do?

12:41.886 --> 12:43.179
Are you going to Choi Mujin?

12:46.348 --> 12:47.725
Captain told me.

12:48.309 --> 12:49.351
Did you let him go

12:50.186 --> 12:51.812
so that you can kill him yourself?

12:53.481 --> 12:55.024
That's right, so step aside.

12:58.402 --> 12:59.236
No.

12:59.904 --> 13:00.946
I'll stop you.

13:07.536 --> 13:08.621
Let go!

13:08.704 --> 13:09.788
Enough already!

13:09.872 --> 13:10.998
Let go!

13:13.292 --> 13:14.752
You know everything now.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.629
You must know why I'm doing this!

13:18.714 --> 13:19.924
I do.

13:21.509 --> 13:22.801
That's why I'm stopping you.

13:23.677 --> 13:24.929
No, you don't know

13:25.721 --> 13:27.223
how I got here.

13:30.017 --> 13:33.103
I threw away my future and my name
to catch the asshole who killed my dad.

13:34.897 --> 13:37.107
But I was fooled by him
and even killed a person.

13:38.359 --> 13:40.736
If I don't kill him,
my life has no meaning.

13:48.369 --> 13:50.371
Is that all your life is worth?

13:52.706 --> 13:54.124
Stay out of it and leave.

14:02.091 --> 14:04.718
How can I ignore you
when you're driving toward sure death?

14:06.095 --> 14:08.639
Even if you kill him,
you'll be utterly destroyed.

14:08.722 --> 14:10.266
Don't you get it?

14:10.349 --> 14:11.934
I don't care. Uncuff me.

14:12.893 --> 14:13.936
I do.

14:16.438 --> 14:18.148
Uncuff me!

14:20.568 --> 14:21.569
Uncuff me!

14:43.132 --> 14:43.966
Get in here.

14:50.139 --> 14:54.101
Get them! Go after them! Stop!

15:55.037 --> 15:56.163
Hold on tight.

16:30.948 --> 16:31.907
We lost her.

16:32.783 --> 16:34.952
<i>Another detective took her
and they disappeared.</i>

18:21.683 --> 18:23.018
We came sooner than expected.

18:25.979 --> 18:26.980
I told you we'd come

18:27.689 --> 18:28.690
to the beach.

19:12.651 --> 19:15.863
A friend who loves to surf
rented this place long-term.

19:50.689 --> 19:51.773
Let me see your wounds.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.109
I'm fine.

19:59.656 --> 20:01.116
Don't get me angry.

20:06.580 --> 20:07.456
Sit down.

20:39.947 --> 20:42.157
I started carrying a knife
after my sister died.

20:45.744 --> 20:47.996
I was determined to kill the bastard

20:49.706 --> 20:50.749
if I ever found him.

21:05.055 --> 21:06.473
Every night, I dreamt

21:08.016 --> 21:09.518
of killing that faceless bastard.

21:12.729 --> 21:14.147
And eventually,

21:15.023 --> 21:16.108
my face changed.

21:22.698 --> 21:25.492
Like a murderer consumed with rage.

21:31.999 --> 21:32.833
I…

21:37.838 --> 21:39.339
was stabbing myself.

21:46.263 --> 21:47.848
Stop destroying yourself.

21:53.395 --> 21:54.479
Stay still.

22:31.933 --> 22:33.852
Don't struggle alone anymore.

22:36.855 --> 22:38.356
You can lean on me anytime.

25:56.513 --> 25:59.057
Choi Mujin put a tattoo on my chest.

26:03.228 --> 26:04.688
And I burned it off.

26:16.783 --> 26:19.369
You and I chose different paths.

26:29.004 --> 26:30.046
Let's catch Choi Mujin

26:31.756 --> 26:32.757
together.

26:38.555 --> 26:40.056
It's what your father wanted.

26:40.974 --> 26:43.059
Judging him by the law
rather than killing him.

26:48.940 --> 26:52.110
Your father wanted it so much
that he was willing to sacrifice his life.

26:54.821 --> 26:56.239
And you'll be the one to do it.

27:27.645 --> 27:31.941
BOW RESTAURANT

27:32.025 --> 27:33.610
-Sir.
-Taeju!

27:34.235 --> 27:35.987
-Where are the boys?
-Not here yet.

27:36.863 --> 27:37.781
Hello.

27:38.740 --> 27:40.700
<i>Pork belly</i>

27:44.204 --> 27:45.413
Sorry, Minjae!

27:45.497 --> 27:46.956
Hey, scram.

27:48.124 --> 27:50.543
Hey. Go home and study.

27:51.044 --> 27:53.546
-What?
-I want to join Dongcheon.

27:53.630 --> 27:55.006
-Hey.
-Take your bag and go.

27:55.090 --> 27:56.883
-What grade are you in?
-Pick this up and go.

27:56.966 --> 27:58.635
-Let him talk.
-What?

27:59.302 --> 28:00.845
What do you mean? He's a kid.

28:00.929 --> 28:02.222
Why do you want to join?

28:03.848 --> 28:04.724
Well…

28:05.433 --> 28:07.060
I want to be cool like you guys.

28:08.228 --> 28:09.396
Gosh.

28:09.479 --> 28:10.480
Are you smart?

28:11.439 --> 28:12.607
Yes, I am.

28:12.690 --> 28:14.984
Hey. Go home and study.

28:15.068 --> 28:16.027
I mean it, Boss.

28:16.111 --> 28:19.781
-You kids watch way too many movies.
-Please accept me. I know I can do it.

28:19.864 --> 28:20.865
Get over here.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.229
<i>Boss. Donghoon…</i>

29:17.589 --> 29:18.423
Dad.

29:19.424 --> 29:20.425
Dad!

29:27.557 --> 29:28.391
Dad.

29:30.059 --> 29:30.977
Dad!

29:33.104 --> 29:34.314
Jiwoo, don't come out!

29:35.064 --> 29:36.191
Don't come out yet.

29:37.233 --> 29:38.568
Open the door!

29:40.904 --> 29:41.905
I…

29:43.281 --> 29:44.532
have never…

29:47.160 --> 29:49.746
betrayed someone who trusted me.

29:52.081 --> 29:54.918
Why do I keep getting betrayed?

30:01.841 --> 30:02.759
At least…

30:04.344 --> 30:06.638
She has a reason to kill me.

30:09.974 --> 30:11.184
That's why…

30:13.061 --> 30:14.354
That's why…

30:16.105 --> 30:17.398
she should've come to me.

30:26.199 --> 30:27.951
Isn't that right, Donghoon?

30:29.661 --> 30:31.037
She should've come to me.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.793
She should've come to me.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.630
The police have requested
an arrest warrant.

30:41.548 --> 30:42.674
You must flee.

30:43.383 --> 30:46.135
They say they have a strong witness.
It's probably Detective Oh.

30:46.928 --> 30:47.887
You should flee.

30:53.184 --> 30:55.812
You said she would come to kill you.

30:56.813 --> 30:57.814
Exactly.

30:58.857 --> 31:00.692
She should've come to me.

31:03.027 --> 31:04.237
She should've

31:05.446 --> 31:06.573
come to me!

31:10.118 --> 31:12.036
Going back to the police is betrayal.

31:17.417 --> 31:18.251
Sir.

31:26.551 --> 31:29.137
Ever since I saved her
from dying on the street,

31:29.220 --> 31:30.388
her life belonged to me.

31:31.931 --> 31:32.849
You need to stop--

31:32.932 --> 31:34.392
No!

31:36.603 --> 31:37.979
I can't stop.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.983
It's not something I can just stop midway.

31:46.446 --> 31:48.823
It won't end until one of us dies.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.202
Either die…

31:56.664 --> 31:57.957
or kill.

32:01.252 --> 32:02.378
So, leave.

32:04.464 --> 32:05.632
Leave!

33:20.456 --> 33:21.332
<i>Jiwoo.</i>

33:23.251 --> 33:24.794
<i>Even if I'm not around,</i>

33:25.962 --> 33:28.923
<i>be happy and live a good life, okay?</i>

34:37.283 --> 34:38.743
You thought I left, didn't you?

34:40.578 --> 34:41.412
I got scared.

34:43.289 --> 34:44.373
"Don't be scared.

34:44.916 --> 34:46.292
We're cops."

34:55.343 --> 34:56.427
Let's go now.

35:34.340 --> 35:35.508
Where should we go?

35:36.467 --> 35:37.844
Far away from here.

35:38.803 --> 35:40.388
Dongcheon is finished.

35:41.097 --> 35:42.014
Yes, ma'am.

36:13.921 --> 36:15.089
It'll be very hard.

36:16.465 --> 36:18.759
The entire world will condemn you.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.846
And you'll be incarcerated.

36:26.726 --> 36:27.602
I know.

36:31.731 --> 36:32.940
I'm prepared.

36:40.364 --> 36:41.908
Whatever you go through,

36:43.618 --> 36:45.077
I'll be by your side.

38:08.286 --> 38:09.287
Hey!

38:09.829 --> 38:11.080
Pildo!

38:12.873 --> 38:14.166
Jeon Pildo!

38:18.254 --> 38:19.338
What happened?

39:02.506 --> 39:03.799
Choi Mujin.

39:03.883 --> 39:05.134
We can catch him.

39:40.586 --> 39:41.587
Open the door.

39:58.312 --> 39:59.313
Hey!

40:57.371 --> 40:59.582
-Where is that bitch?
-Hurry and find her.

44:06.018 --> 44:07.102
You look tired.

44:08.437 --> 44:09.605
It's bearable.

44:11.607 --> 44:13.442
I still have enough energy to kill you.

44:21.742 --> 44:23.619
Sure. Of course.

44:29.625 --> 44:31.210
Donghoon was weak.

44:33.629 --> 44:35.756
He had several chances to kill me,

44:36.674 --> 44:38.050
but he lacked the courage.

44:41.553 --> 44:43.180
He was born to be prey.

44:52.981 --> 44:54.316
Himself,

44:55.275 --> 44:56.402
his daughter,

44:57.694 --> 44:58.529
me…

45:01.448 --> 45:04.535
So weak he made
everyone around him miserable.

45:11.458 --> 45:12.626
But you were different.

45:14.670 --> 45:16.130
You acted without fear.

45:20.217 --> 45:21.135
So why?

45:24.221 --> 45:26.390
Haven't you been waiting for this moment?

45:27.766 --> 45:28.767
So why?

45:30.644 --> 45:32.062
Why did you hesitate?

45:54.084 --> 45:55.461
That's right, I hesitated.

45:59.465 --> 46:01.425
Because I wanted to live
like a human being.

46:09.141 --> 46:12.019
You asked if I wanted revenge
regardless of the price.

46:13.228 --> 46:15.564
I didn't know what you meant back then.

46:19.067 --> 46:20.068
But I do now.

46:24.031 --> 46:26.325
The price of revenge is
becoming a monster.

46:27.534 --> 46:28.952
A monster like you.

46:42.341 --> 46:43.175
That's right.

46:47.179 --> 46:48.597
You're a lot like me.

46:51.016 --> 46:52.100
Can you become…

46:55.395 --> 46:56.396
a monster?

47:00.400 --> 47:01.610
Because I hesitated,

47:04.446 --> 47:07.074
another person precious to me died.

47:11.537 --> 47:13.163
Someone who understood my pain.

47:15.290 --> 47:17.751
The one person I could lean on.

47:26.718 --> 47:27.928
I'll become…

47:31.390 --> 47:32.349
a monster.

47:36.812 --> 47:40.440
And I'll watch you closely
as you take your last breath.

48:16.268 --> 48:17.769
Can you kill me like that?

48:22.691 --> 48:23.650
Good.

49:32.052 --> 49:33.095
Get up.

49:34.721 --> 49:35.597
That's right.

49:45.524 --> 49:46.483
Get up!

49:49.861 --> 49:51.154
Stab me!

49:56.368 --> 49:57.285
Again.

49:58.954 --> 50:00.038
That's right.

50:00.956 --> 50:02.082
That's right.

50:04.376 --> 50:05.711
You have to get up.

50:10.257 --> 50:13.176
It won't end until one of us dies.

51:02.225 --> 51:03.351
The temple.

51:05.645 --> 51:06.688
Upper lip.

51:09.065 --> 51:10.025
Chin.

51:11.443 --> 51:12.402
Solar plexus.

51:14.571 --> 51:15.655
Stab me.

51:19.326 --> 51:20.368
Stab me.

51:23.121 --> 51:24.247
Stab me!

51:27.292 --> 51:28.210
Stab me!

51:39.221 --> 51:40.597
This is where it ends for you.

51:45.268 --> 51:46.144
Accept it.

51:47.938 --> 51:48.814
You

51:49.898 --> 51:51.149
cannot become a monster.

54:30.016 --> 54:33.895
DECEASED, KIM JEONGA

55:00.755 --> 55:03.883
TO DAD, FROM SONG JIWOO

55:08.096 --> 55:13.101
