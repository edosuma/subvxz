WEBVTT

00:09.176 --> 00:10.552
-Hey.
-Hey.

00:11.303 --> 00:14.097
What you doing up so early?
Started work already?

00:14.181 --> 00:15.640
Yeah, couldn't sleep.

00:15.723 --> 00:18.018
Figured I'd get some extra work done.

00:18.101 --> 00:20.353
Maybe Dad would notice and love me.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.276
-What the hell you doing over here?
-Oh, man. [sighs]

00:26.359 --> 00:27.985
Came straight from the bar.

00:28.861 --> 00:30.822
I had a shit ton to do after we closed.

00:30.905 --> 00:33.741
Gotta restock the inventory,
mop the floors,

00:33.825 --> 00:36.119
turn all the expired burgers into chili.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.706
Hey, you want some chili?

00:41.833 --> 00:43.543
Made with expired burgers?

00:44.794 --> 00:46.003
Yeah, sure.

00:48.881 --> 00:50.633
Hey, how long you've been
growing that beard for, huh?

00:50.717 --> 00:51.718
A month or two?

00:52.510 --> 00:54.221
Yeah, something like that. Why?

00:54.304 --> 00:55.722
It's pathetic.

00:57.014 --> 00:59.642
You know, two days ago,
I was clean-shaven.

01:00.935 --> 01:02.062
[softly] Whatever.

01:02.145 --> 01:04.814
Hey, uh, I ran into Juan.

01:04.897 --> 01:06.691
-You know, from the Peterson place?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:06.774 --> 01:08.276
Said they's thinking about selling.

01:08.360 --> 01:09.819
-No kidding, huh?
-Yeah.

01:09.902 --> 01:12.197
Man, that place is badass.
All that riverfront?

01:12.280 --> 01:15.242
[chuckles] Remember we used to sneak
them Thompson sisters over there

01:15.325 --> 01:16.951
-and go skinny-dipping?
-[chuckles]

01:18.078 --> 01:21.331
Yeah. I went skinny-dipping.
You ran off with my clothes.

01:23.208 --> 01:25.042
Old man Peterson's chasing me around,

01:25.127 --> 01:27.545
shooting me with rock salt pellets
in the ass.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.088
[both chuckle]

01:30.632 --> 01:34.093
-I think we should buy that place.
-Yeah? That's a great idea.

01:34.177 --> 01:35.928
We can do that right after
we buy the Broncos.

01:39.432 --> 01:42.059
Oh. Morning, boys.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.192
Brenda... hey.

01:52.237 --> 01:53.280
Brenda.

01:54.531 --> 01:56.032
Hey, Brenda.

01:56.949 --> 01:58.660
Mind if I help myself to some coffee?

01:58.743 --> 01:59.952
Of course...

02:02.038 --> 02:03.456
Brenda.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.544
Why, it's supposed to be nice today.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.422
Yeah. Sunny... Brenda.

02:11.881 --> 02:14.091
Well, it is good to see you, boys.

02:14.842 --> 02:16.344
You, too, Brenda.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.226
[mouthing] What the fuck?

02:25.353 --> 02:26.563
Dude, did you know about that?

02:26.646 --> 02:27.689
[whispering] No.

02:27.772 --> 02:29.316
Wait, so Dad and Brenda...

02:29.399 --> 02:32.902
I mean, if they did,
it probably killed him.

02:40.993 --> 02:43.288
I'm sure you two have a lot of questions.

02:45.457 --> 02:47.542
Let me answer 'em all for you.

02:48.251 --> 02:50.127
None of your fucking business.

02:54.424 --> 02:56.426
[theme song playing]

03:57.654 --> 03:59.614
What's up, girl? You gotta eat.

04:01.115 --> 04:02.825
Look, look, it's good. Look.

04:02.909 --> 04:04.994
Mmm, yummy, mmm.

04:05.077 --> 04:07.997
Dale, what's the market
for a grass-fed jackass?

04:08.915 --> 04:10.917
Well, he's lean, but, uh...

04:11.000 --> 04:14.211
I expect he's got a whole lotta diseases.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.464
Yeah, funny.

04:17.089 --> 04:20.051
She ain't eaten in days.
I'll try about anything at this point.

04:20.635 --> 04:22.053
Well, let me take a look.

04:24.597 --> 04:27.934
So, how are you and Brenda getting along?

04:28.017 --> 04:29.727
Oh, shit.

04:32.188 --> 04:34.023
Who told you about that?

04:34.106 --> 04:36.025
Oh, I follow Brenda on Instagram.

04:36.108 --> 04:38.361
She's always puttin' up
pictures of her food.

04:38.445 --> 04:40.363
She had prime rib last night

04:40.447 --> 04:43.658
and I saw your reflection
in the au jus. [chuckles]

04:45.785 --> 04:48.413
[chuckling] Should've made her
get the rib eye.

04:48.496 --> 04:50.873
What happened to Joanne
over at the Cracker Barrel?

04:50.957 --> 04:52.375
You hit it and quit it?

04:55.628 --> 04:57.422
I'm not talking about this.

04:57.505 --> 05:00.800
Oh, she moved back to Phoenix
to take care of her granddaughter,

05:00.883 --> 05:02.635
'cause her daughter's in rehab.

05:02.719 --> 05:05.555
You didn't hear it from me,
but, meth. [chuckles]

05:05.638 --> 05:07.181
All right, I'm done here.

05:07.264 --> 05:09.309
Dale, fix this cow and send me a bill.

05:09.392 --> 05:11.102
And I'll know if you overcharge me.

05:11.185 --> 05:12.854
Well, you haven't yet!

05:14.188 --> 05:18.651
Good God, getting laid
and he's still a grumpy son of a bitch.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.069
[Colt chuckles]

05:20.152 --> 05:22.572
Oh, uh, how's Heather doing?

05:22.655 --> 05:24.240
She's good. Thanks for asking.

05:24.324 --> 05:27.159
Hey, uh, did you, uh...

05:27.910 --> 05:30.622
hear anything about the Peterson ranch
being for sale?

05:30.705 --> 05:34.334
Well, I was over at the feed store
talking to Glenn, now that I...

05:34.417 --> 05:37.003
[stutters] You know that thing
he's got on his face?

05:37.629 --> 05:39.088
He had that removed.

05:39.171 --> 05:42.884
It's a mole,
but the damn thing had teeth in it.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.763
Dale, the Peterson ranch?

05:46.846 --> 05:50.224
Oh! Oh, yeah.
Yeah, uh, Glenn said they're sellin' it.

05:50.307 --> 05:51.518
Ah.

05:52.560 --> 05:53.811
They got any offers?

05:53.895 --> 05:57.314
I understand
Neumann's Hill's been sniffing around.

05:58.775 --> 06:00.568
Boy, teeth in a mole.

06:00.652 --> 06:02.028
[chuckles]

06:02.111 --> 06:04.906
That's something
you'd see on  Stranger Things.

06:05.573 --> 06:08.242
I just loved it
when that little bald-headed girl

06:09.035 --> 06:12.121
starts moving things with her mind.

06:13.247 --> 06:16.501
I just love it when this little
bald-headed guy says shit like that.

06:23.215 --> 06:25.176
You didn't finish your steak.
Didn't you like it?

06:25.259 --> 06:27.887
I really enjoyed
the first pound and a half.

06:28.471 --> 06:31.558
I told you not to fill up on that salad.

06:31.641 --> 06:34.894
You get all the greens you need
from a grass-fed cow.

06:34.977 --> 06:36.228
[chuckles]

06:37.063 --> 06:41.609
So, did the boys say anything
about me being here this morning?

06:41.693 --> 06:44.028
I made it clear
I didn't wanna get into it.

06:44.571 --> 06:47.156
I don't like people
talking about my business.

06:47.239 --> 06:49.617
But they're your sons. They're not people.

06:49.701 --> 06:51.744
Couldn't have said it better myself.

06:53.746 --> 06:58.585
Oh, my friends Don and Judy are having
a wine-tasting party this weekend.

06:58.668 --> 06:59.544
Would you like to come?

07:01.170 --> 07:03.005
If I'm gonna watch somebody
spit in a bucket,

07:03.089 --> 07:04.841
it better be a boxing match.

07:05.633 --> 07:06.593
[chuckles]

07:06.676 --> 07:08.302
Would like to see you, though.

07:08.385 --> 07:11.347
Well, there is a new sushi place
in Grand Junction

07:11.431 --> 07:13.057
that I've been dying to try.

07:13.140 --> 07:16.894
Any chance you've been dying
to try Charlie's Steakhouse?

07:18.354 --> 07:20.857
Has it changed since the last three times
we went there?

07:20.940 --> 07:22.274
God, I hope not.

07:22.358 --> 07:23.818
[chuckling]

07:24.486 --> 07:27.238
Well, that sounds delightful, Beau.

07:28.280 --> 07:31.200
Hell, I can always have sushi
with my girlfriends.

07:31.283 --> 07:32.619
I appreciate it.

07:35.872 --> 07:37.915
Maybe your sons can join us at Charlie's.

07:38.708 --> 07:40.167
God, I hope not.

07:46.966 --> 07:47.884
[Colt] Mr. Peterson.

07:49.176 --> 07:51.137
It's, uh, Colt Bennett?

07:52.263 --> 07:53.305
Remember me?

07:53.389 --> 07:56.934
You don't forget the ass you pumped
full of salt with a 12-gauge.

07:57.935 --> 07:59.311
Yeah.

07:59.395 --> 08:02.732
You know, most people wouldn't
just shoot at a naked 15-year-old.

08:04.316 --> 08:06.402
Just be glad
that you weren't running towards me.

08:08.655 --> 08:12.116
Hey, uh, you know, I was wondering
if I could talk to you about something.

08:12.199 --> 08:14.911
Sure. Whiskey?

08:15.995 --> 08:16.996
Yeah.

08:19.165 --> 08:21.333
-I made it myself. [sniffles]
-Oh.

08:23.044 --> 08:24.170
Thank you.

08:29.091 --> 08:30.176
[clears throat]

08:30.259 --> 08:31.844
Wow. That's strong. [chuckles]

08:31.928 --> 08:34.681
Mmm... [clicks tongue]
I can't feel my tongue.

08:35.848 --> 08:38.017
In a pinch,
I can use it to run the tractor.

08:38.100 --> 08:39.936
Yeah! Whoo!

08:41.270 --> 08:42.313
What's on your mind?

08:42.396 --> 08:46.442
I, uh, heard you was thinking about
selling this place

08:46.526 --> 08:49.111
and I was wondering...
Is this whiskey or varnish?

08:51.072 --> 08:53.658
You think I'm gonna sell this place
to a Bennett?

08:55.284 --> 08:58.412
Your old man pulled my deer stand down
30 years ago

08:58.495 --> 09:01.165
and he still hasn't paid me back for it.

09:01.248 --> 09:03.209
Yeah, yeah. [stammers]

09:03.292 --> 09:05.920
Technically, he said it was on our land.

09:06.003 --> 09:08.923
[imitating Colt] Yeah, yeah.
Well, technically, he's a fucking liar.

09:10.717 --> 09:12.301
You know what?
[stutters] Never mind that.

09:12.384 --> 09:14.011
My dad don't even know I'm here.

09:14.095 --> 09:19.100
I just... I heard that Neumann's Hill's
been sniffing around.

09:20.602 --> 09:24.647
Mr. Peterson, we gotta keep these
family ranches in the hands of families.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.107
[clicks tongue]

09:26.190 --> 09:27.817
Yeah, I thought about that.

09:30.194 --> 09:31.070
Look...

09:33.489 --> 09:37.451
Normally, I'd never think of selling
to Neumann's Hill.

09:39.411 --> 09:42.624
But about a month ago, doc told me...

09:45.209 --> 09:48.087
I got brain cancer. Inoperable.

09:50.339 --> 09:51.716
He give me a year, tops.

09:53.676 --> 09:54.761
I'm so sorry.

09:54.844 --> 09:58.264
Yeah, well, that don't change much.

09:59.599 --> 10:05.021
Although, I just bought
a brand new Silverado crew cab

10:05.104 --> 10:06.814
with a five-year loan.

10:07.439 --> 10:08.650
Suckers!

10:10.276 --> 10:12.904
So, I'm gonna cash out...

10:14.030 --> 10:18.034
Spend whatever time I have left
pulling trout outta Andrews Lake.

10:19.786 --> 10:23.289
And that Neumann's Hill offer...

10:24.666 --> 10:26.083
it's pretty fucking good.

10:26.709 --> 10:27.627
Mr. Peterson...

10:30.296 --> 10:31.588
I know this land.

10:32.632 --> 10:35.927
I mean, mostly from running around on it
while you were shooting at me.

10:36.761 --> 10:39.764
But, uh, you know, my first kiss...

10:40.556 --> 10:42.433
was underneath that elm tree
right over there?

10:43.225 --> 10:44.351
Courtney Miller.

10:44.435 --> 10:45.687
[chuckles softly]

10:46.646 --> 10:51.067
I also know that the south pasture is
where kids said you bury bodies.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.987
Really, it's where you buried
your family dogs.

10:55.988 --> 10:57.614
South pasture's that way.

11:00.993 --> 11:03.245
Think this whiskey's messing
with my internal compass.

11:03.329 --> 11:04.413
[Colt chuckles]

11:04.496 --> 11:08.835
[stammers] The point is,
is that Neumann's Hill, they...

11:08.918 --> 11:12.171
they don't care about your land or you.

11:13.881 --> 11:14.966
But I do.

11:16.425 --> 11:17.634
And I...

11:18.344 --> 11:20.262
[stammers] We can't pay you what they can,

11:20.346 --> 11:21.764
but me and my dad,
we can go down to the bank,

11:21.848 --> 11:23.224
see what we can get.

11:25.101 --> 11:26.310
[chuckles softly]

11:27.353 --> 11:28.730
Well, I'll be damned.

11:30.022 --> 11:32.441
I might actually sell
to the fucking Bennetts.

11:33.442 --> 11:34.526
Yeah?

11:35.694 --> 11:36.863
Give us a shot?

11:39.281 --> 11:42.034
-We might be able to work something out.
-All right.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.786
Thank you, Mr. Peterson.

11:43.870 --> 11:47.581
[stutters] And I'll get that cash
my dad owes you for that deer stand.

11:48.165 --> 11:50.334
I'll need an apology from him, too.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.629
Yeah. I can get the money,

11:53.712 --> 11:55.339
but I'm not a miracle worker. [chuckles]

12:01.470 --> 12:02.972
-Hey, Mary.
-Oh, hey, Beau.

12:03.055 --> 12:05.682
-'Sup, Dad?
-How are things with you and Brenda?

12:08.770 --> 12:10.354
What the fuck?

12:11.188 --> 12:12.899
Babe, I told you not to say nothing.

12:12.982 --> 12:16.152
Yeah, well, I told you not to tell Darlene
I dropped her kid.

12:18.654 --> 12:21.240
I am sorry things didn't work out
with Joanne,

12:21.323 --> 12:23.409
but it's nice you're spending time
with Brenda.

12:23.492 --> 12:25.286
You know, you guys make a cute couple.

12:25.369 --> 12:27.079
Yeah, I suppose.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.541
But, see, now she wants me
to do things like

12:30.624 --> 12:33.795
eat sushi and taste wine.

12:36.130 --> 12:38.465
-What a bitch.
-[Rooster chuckles]

12:39.133 --> 12:41.343
Nothing wrong with trying new things, Dad.

12:41.427 --> 12:44.180
You know, it's like in high school.
All I used to drink was Coors.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.682
Then one day, 7-Eleven was out,
so I tried a Bud.

12:48.642 --> 12:51.979
It was like tasting the sweet milk
that flows from America's teat.

12:53.815 --> 12:55.649
God bless America.

12:59.236 --> 13:00.696
[chuckles]

13:00.779 --> 13:03.532
I think what Rooster is
unsuccessfully trying to say...

13:04.283 --> 13:07.036
is you just have to open yourself up
to new experiences.

13:07.119 --> 13:09.538
It's good, right?
Change can be good sometimes.

13:09.621 --> 13:12.834
I watched one of those Bond movies
with Roger Moore.

13:13.792 --> 13:15.127
I hated it.

13:15.211 --> 13:16.337
[chuckles]

13:16.420 --> 13:19.298
All right, Beau, good luck.
I gotta go to work.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.633
-[clears throat] I will call you later.
-[yawns] Alright.

13:21.717 --> 13:23.385
-See you, babe.
-Mmm. Yeah.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.388
-That is payment for my beer.
-[chuckles]

13:28.891 --> 13:32.436
You know, I could pay with kisses, too.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.316
-Oh, hi, Colt.
-Oh, hey.

13:37.399 --> 13:39.861
You know, actually,
I'm glad I ran into ya.

13:39.944 --> 13:43.780
I've been meaning to drop this off
at your house.

13:43.865 --> 13:45.950
It's some money
for Heather's doctor's bills.

13:46.033 --> 13:48.744
Oh, thank you. It's sweet.

13:48.827 --> 13:50.746
Do... [chuckles]

13:50.829 --> 13:53.290
Do you really still need to be putting
a little number 12

13:53.374 --> 13:54.791
next to your signature?

13:56.502 --> 13:58.754
Yeah. That way it's an autograph.

13:58.837 --> 14:01.090
Now it's up to you.
You can frame it or cash it.

14:03.050 --> 14:04.093
Cash it.

14:05.928 --> 14:07.263
Everybody does.

14:08.639 --> 14:11.600
Oh, hey. Glad you're both here.
Need to talk to y'all.

14:12.143 --> 14:14.103
Oh, good, Colt wants to talk.

14:16.272 --> 14:18.565
You're like the Roger Moore of sons.

14:22.444 --> 14:24.738
-All right, hear me out.
-[sighs]

14:25.531 --> 14:27.366
-I think we should buy--
-No.

14:28.409 --> 14:30.369
[chuckles] Man, he hates you.

14:33.122 --> 14:35.541
The Peterson ranch is for sale.
I think we should buy it.

14:35.624 --> 14:39.253
We haven't got a pot to piss in
and you wanna buy another ranch?

14:40.296 --> 14:41.547
Dad, it's a great piece of land.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.299
I think the bank will give us
a loan for it.

14:43.382 --> 14:46.218
Now, look, I know you and Peterson got
your issues...

14:46.302 --> 14:49.263
The man built a deer stand on my property.

14:50.306 --> 14:53.059
And then when I tear it down,
he wants me to pay for it.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.185
You know, Dad, on the plus side,

14:54.268 --> 14:56.020
he did shoot Colt in the ass
with a shotgun.

14:57.563 --> 15:00.107
-I did enjoy that.
-[Rooster chuckles]

15:00.191 --> 15:03.777
Dad, you're always talking about
passing our brand down

15:03.860 --> 15:06.072
from generation to generation, right?

15:06.155 --> 15:08.240
Well, this will make Iron River stronger.

15:08.324 --> 15:09.616
We'll double the size of our herd.

15:09.700 --> 15:12.119
We can amortize our expenditures
over a larger number.

15:12.203 --> 15:14.205
It's simple economies of scale.

15:14.288 --> 15:15.998
Somebody been watching  Shark Tank.

15:17.083 --> 15:18.375
But this'll work.

15:18.459 --> 15:20.752
Colt, I'm out.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.591
You know,
what's weird is that he said that.

15:25.674 --> 15:27.134
I know he's never seen that show.

15:28.177 --> 15:29.511
[Colt sighs]

15:30.346 --> 15:31.763
I knew he was gonna say no.

15:31.847 --> 15:34.976
Yeah, well, what'd you expect?
The only time Dad says yes

15:35.059 --> 15:37.644
is if somebody asks him
if he's ashamed of you.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.772
[grunts] You know what?

15:41.941 --> 15:44.360
Don't matter. We don't need him.

15:44.443 --> 15:46.362
-[sighs]
-We can do this, you and I.

15:47.738 --> 15:50.282
Come on, Colt, man.
I'm running the bar for Mom, you know.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.659
I ain't got the kinda scratch
it takes to start a ranch.

15:52.743 --> 15:54.036
Yeah, all we need is enough
for a down payment.

15:54.120 --> 15:55.329
We can scrape that together.

15:55.412 --> 15:58.707
[stammers] If Neumann's Hill gets it,
how are we gonna compete with them?

15:59.959 --> 16:01.085
It is a good piece of land.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.462
Look, I know you want this.

16:04.130 --> 16:06.632
And that Peterson place?
That's... that's the one.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.092
Yeah, it is.

16:08.175 --> 16:10.719
Man, we were talking about
running our own place

16:10.802 --> 16:12.304
-when we were little kids, you know.
-Yeah.

16:12.388 --> 16:15.141
[clicks tongue] Let me try and figure
something out. I'll call Mom later.

16:15.224 --> 16:16.308
Fuck yeah!

16:18.144 --> 16:20.104
Now we gotta start thinking
about designing our brand.

16:20.187 --> 16:21.313
"The Bennett Brothers."

16:21.397 --> 16:23.399
-[both chuckle]
-Dude, already got it.

16:23.482 --> 16:27.319
Two B's smooshed together
like four boobs in a lesbian hug.

16:38.080 --> 16:39.873
-Hey.
-Hey, Beau.

16:40.582 --> 16:42.626
I wasn't expecting you for another hour.

16:42.709 --> 16:46.797
Oh, and I cannot go to a local steak house
with work hair.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.175
That's just bad advertising.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.094
I think you look real nice.

16:53.595 --> 16:55.847
Thank you.
I think you look real nice, too, Beau.

16:55.931 --> 16:56.973
[chuckles]

16:58.100 --> 16:59.101
[Beau] Mmm.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.645
Mmm, and you smell good, too.

17:01.728 --> 17:03.064
Well, thanks.

17:03.772 --> 17:06.525
I was out of soap
and I had to borrow Colt's.

17:06.608 --> 17:10.529
Dove Cucumber & Green Tea
Foaming Body Wash.

17:11.238 --> 17:12.781
[both chuckle softly]

17:12.864 --> 17:14.325
-Listen...
-Hmm?

17:14.408 --> 17:17.078
I was thinking, maybe we can do
something different tonight.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.788
Wow, did a new steak house open up?

17:21.082 --> 17:22.166
No.

17:22.791 --> 17:24.418
I mean, I don't know. Maybe.

17:25.377 --> 17:26.545
No, I'd know.

17:26.628 --> 17:27.838
[chuckles]

17:29.048 --> 17:30.841
I picked us up some sushi.

17:30.924 --> 17:32.176
Are you serious?

17:32.884 --> 17:36.597
Wait, did you just catch a trout,
cut it up and put it in that bag?

17:37.431 --> 17:40.059
No, but that's basically
what the chef did.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.812
I also got us some wine.

17:43.895 --> 17:47.233
Wow. You bought wine? Ooh.

17:47.316 --> 17:50.486
You do know that that comes
from California or France.

17:50.569 --> 17:51.987
No, not this.

17:52.071 --> 17:53.489
This is the good stuff.

17:55.657 --> 17:57.076
From Texas.

17:58.660 --> 18:02.248
"I got friends in merlot places." [laughs]

18:03.582 --> 18:06.335
You know,
you did not have to do this, Beau.

18:06.418 --> 18:09.171
I would have been perfectly happy
going to Charlie's with you again.

18:09.255 --> 18:11.548
Well, I know that and I appreciate it.

18:11.632 --> 18:13.509
But I wanted to do something you like.

18:14.468 --> 18:17.053
Well, it warms my heart
that you would do this for me.

18:17.138 --> 18:20.141
It's not your heart that needs warming.

18:20.224 --> 18:21.808
It's the fish.

18:22.726 --> 18:24.436
[chuckles]

18:24.520 --> 18:26.647
Well, try one. You only live once.

18:26.730 --> 18:28.023
God, I hope that's true.

18:37.824 --> 18:38.867
Well, what do you think?

18:42.954 --> 18:44.165
Delicious.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.376
Oh, I'm full.

18:55.592 --> 18:56.718
Shit!

18:57.386 --> 18:59.721
[chuckles] I'm a fucking dragon.

19:02.641 --> 19:05.269
Hey. Hey. Take a hit of this shit.

19:06.102 --> 19:07.313
-What's this?
-Hmm.

19:15.321 --> 19:16.655
It's not bad. A little mild.

19:18.574 --> 19:20.159
Hey, uh, did you talk to Mom?

19:20.242 --> 19:21.410
Yeah.

19:22.411 --> 19:25.706
-What'd she say?
-[sighs] Well, it's complicated.

19:26.582 --> 19:27.958
She said she's on board.

19:28.667 --> 19:30.711
She'll come back,
figure out what to do with the bar.

19:30.794 --> 19:33.672
She even said she'd pull out some equity
to help us with the down payment.

19:33.755 --> 19:35.841
Oh, fuck, yeah!
And by the way, equity?

19:35.924 --> 19:37.384
Nice.  Shark Tank?  [chuckles]

19:37.468 --> 19:38.552
Hey, let's go call Peterson.

19:38.635 --> 19:39.678
-Get this thing going.
-Yeah.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.347
Hey, dude, hang on a second.

19:42.389 --> 19:44.933
[sighs] I can't do it.

19:45.684 --> 19:49.313
-What? You just said Mom was cool with it.
-[sighs]

19:50.021 --> 19:53.192
I know, but you know
what she was doing when I called her?

19:53.275 --> 19:54.860
She's down in South Carolina

19:54.943 --> 19:58.489
trying to stop a hotel from getting built
on some turtle breeding ground.

19:59.615 --> 20:01.742
It was the happiest I've heard her
in a long time, man.

20:02.784 --> 20:05.662
I don't even think she was stoned
or drunk. Imagine that?

20:06.455 --> 20:08.039
Just being happy on your own?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.419
Look, I just can't fuck with that.

20:14.129 --> 20:17.299
No. This... this is our shot.

20:17.883 --> 20:19.385
Just like you was talking about.
We been...

20:19.468 --> 20:21.803
We been talking about
running our own ranch since we was kids.

20:21.887 --> 20:24.139
Yeah, I know, but under
better circumstances, you know,

20:24.223 --> 20:25.682
like when Dad's dead.

20:27.809 --> 20:29.102
Look. [sighs]

20:29.185 --> 20:32.147
You know I want to do this, right?
It's just not the right time for me.

20:32.231 --> 20:34.483
-No.
-Dude, there's gonna be other places.

20:34.566 --> 20:36.443
No, no. This is the one.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.111
Man, we've gotta make this happen.

20:38.194 --> 20:39.405
Colt. [sighs]

20:40.071 --> 20:42.533
I'm sorry, dude. I promised Mom, okay?

20:43.492 --> 20:45.869
You help Mom,
but you won't help your own brother?

20:46.662 --> 20:50.123
Dude, you know
I want to run a ranch with you someday.

20:50.206 --> 20:51.207
Nah.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.377
[scoffs]

20:53.460 --> 20:54.795
No, fuck this.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.173
-You're using Mom as an excuse.
-Come on!

20:58.257 --> 21:01.092
Same reason why you never left
this piece of shit town.

21:01.176 --> 21:03.262
'Cause you're just...
You're too afraid to be your own man.

21:03.345 --> 21:05.681
First you work for Daddy,
now you work for Mommy.

21:06.348 --> 21:07.349
Oh, okay.

21:08.016 --> 21:09.643
So you're giving life advice now?

21:10.311 --> 21:12.103
Well, how about this?
I'll let you know when I need help

21:12.187 --> 21:13.689
-fucking up my entire existence.
-Oh!

21:13.772 --> 21:15.691
Or better yet, you know,
maybe you can explain to me

21:15.774 --> 21:17.693
the finer points of being a selfish dick

21:17.776 --> 21:19.361
who never thought twice
about anybody but himself.

21:19.445 --> 21:20.987
At least I took my shot!

21:21.071 --> 21:22.864
-At least I tried to fucking be something!
-Yeah!

21:22.948 --> 21:24.157
And you fucking failed!

21:24.240 --> 21:25.284
-Yeah, well, fuck you!
-Fuck you!

21:25.367 --> 21:27.035
Yeah, you know what?
I don't need your help.

21:27.118 --> 21:28.244
I'll just do it myself!

21:36.628 --> 21:38.880
-Hey, babe.
-[chuckles]

21:38.964 --> 21:41.300
Hey, what are you doing here so late?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.594
Is that champagne?

21:43.677 --> 21:46.137
-Yeah, sure is.
-[chuckles]

21:46.221 --> 21:47.723
-[squeals]
-[chuckles]

21:48.557 --> 21:49.808
What the actual fuck?

21:49.891 --> 21:51.893
You know
I'm afraid of champagne bottles opening.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.771
Oh, come on.
That ain't a real fear.

21:55.356 --> 21:56.732
Well, if I'm afraid of it,

21:56.815 --> 21:58.692
-it's a real fear.
-[chuckles]

22:00.235 --> 22:03.364
-We are celebrating.
-What?

22:03.447 --> 22:05.866
Celebrating? What?

22:05.949 --> 22:07.743
Okay, the ranch next to ours?

22:07.826 --> 22:09.244
-Mmm-hmm.
-It's for sale.

22:10.787 --> 22:11.955
You and me, we're gonna buy it.

22:12.914 --> 22:14.333
-We're gonna live in it.
-[laughs]

22:14.416 --> 22:17.293
We're gonna swim with our kids
in the above-ground pool.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.255
You and the kids
will be playing Marco Polo.

22:20.339 --> 22:22.674
I'll be on one of them
big inflatable yellow ducks,

22:22.758 --> 22:25.051
drinking beer out of a red Solo Cup.

22:25.135 --> 22:28.597
[chuckles] Oh, listening to
Toby Keith singing "Red Solo Cup."

22:31.600 --> 22:34.853
Oh, what the hell are you talking about?

22:35.521 --> 22:36.938
[laughs]

22:37.814 --> 22:39.315
We can't afford a ranch.

22:39.400 --> 22:40.651
Sure we can. We'll sell some shit.

22:40.734 --> 22:44.613
[stutters] I got money from the calf sale,
you got money in savings.

22:44.696 --> 22:45.739
We'll figure it out.

22:45.822 --> 22:48.033
And, look, if we can't afford
the above-ground pool...

22:48.700 --> 22:51.662
we'll just let the kids swim
in the river. [chuckles]

22:52.663 --> 22:55.416
Actually, it's better that way.
We don't care if they piss in the river.

22:57.626 --> 22:59.836
Colt, it's just not possible.

23:01.212 --> 23:02.589
Anything's possible...

23:03.424 --> 23:05.884
-if you put your mind to it.
-[chuckles]

23:05.967 --> 23:08.470
Well, as a teacher who tells
her students that every day,

23:08.554 --> 23:10.514
I think we both know that is a lie.

23:10.597 --> 23:11.723
[chuckles]

23:15.393 --> 23:19.606
Come on, don't you want this?
Can't you see it?

23:19.690 --> 23:22.609
I love that you're thinking
about our future, but...

23:24.027 --> 23:27.030
I gotta be honest. I mean,
this is all coming across a little...

23:27.906 --> 23:28.907
crazy.

23:32.327 --> 23:34.204
The only thing that's crazy
is that you don't see it.

23:35.080 --> 23:37.708
[stutters] I mean, come... This is us.

23:37.791 --> 23:39.835
This is our life, you and me.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.087
And that ranch... This...

23:42.170 --> 23:43.630
We gotta make this happen.

23:43.714 --> 23:48.218
Okay... [sighs]
something's going on with you.

23:48.927 --> 23:50.303
I mean, for the past month or two...

23:51.012 --> 23:53.974
you've barely slept, you don't eat...

23:54.808 --> 23:56.017
and you've been working constantly.

23:56.101 --> 23:58.729
I don't remember the last time I've seen
you without a drink in your hand.

24:00.271 --> 24:02.357
[chuckles] Champagne don't count.

24:04.192 --> 24:06.653
French, they give this to babies
at weddings.

24:10.532 --> 24:11.658
You know, uh...

24:14.244 --> 24:16.037
something else happened
a month or two ago.

24:19.708 --> 24:21.126
It's got nothing to do with that.

24:21.752 --> 24:22.753
Come on, Colt.

24:22.836 --> 24:25.964
What? Me wanting a ranch has nothing to do
with Heather losing the baby.

24:26.047 --> 24:27.633
Then why don't you ever wanna talk to me
about it?

24:27.716 --> 24:29.342
Every time I bring it up,
you shut me down.

24:29.425 --> 24:32.804
What's the point? What happened, happened.
It sucked. It's over.

24:32.888 --> 24:34.723
Okay, well, if you can't talk to me,
talk to Heather.

24:35.557 --> 24:37.684
She went through it, too.
Maybe she can help you.

24:37.768 --> 24:38.894
I'm fine!

24:38.977 --> 24:40.186
[scoffs]

24:41.522 --> 24:42.814
I don't think you are.

24:44.566 --> 24:46.317
Okay, yeah, you know what?
You're right about everything.

24:46.401 --> 24:47.694
Now you're right about how I feel.

24:47.778 --> 24:49.571
No. You don't have to be a jerk about it.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.072
Well, then fucking drop it.

24:52.157 --> 24:54.450
It's none of your business.
You weren't even involved anyway.

24:56.912 --> 24:59.330
[sighs] Wow.

24:59.414 --> 25:00.832
[sniffles]

25:00.916 --> 25:03.960
Yeah, you're right, Colt.
I wasn't even involved at all.

25:04.670 --> 25:05.921
Thanks.

25:07.255 --> 25:08.715
You know, I'm gonna go to bed.

25:08.799 --> 25:10.133
-[stutters] Ab--
-No, you...

25:10.717 --> 25:12.343
you can sleep on the couch.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.764
Enjoy the champagne.

25:22.478 --> 25:23.564
[sniffles]

25:24.606 --> 25:25.941
[exhales]

25:26.024 --> 25:27.025
[inhales sharply]

25:28.484 --> 25:29.485
Heather?

25:31.071 --> 25:32.155
Hey, Colt.

25:32.238 --> 25:33.448
Where am I?

25:34.616 --> 25:37.368
What happened?
Did you and I--

25:37.452 --> 25:38.954
Are you fucking kidding me?

25:41.707 --> 25:43.249
Abby asked me to come over.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.542
[sighs]

25:45.501 --> 25:46.587
Great.

25:47.212 --> 25:49.756
And I brought you a cup of coffee.
[clears throat]

25:49.840 --> 25:51.466
Oh. [exhales]

25:51.549 --> 25:52.634
Thank you.

25:52.718 --> 25:54.219
-Yeah, I figured you might need it.
-Yeah.

25:55.178 --> 25:56.262
[sighs]

25:57.472 --> 25:58.974
[scoffs]

25:59.891 --> 26:02.728
Hangover, you are tomorrow's problem.

26:02.811 --> 26:04.479
[laughs]

26:05.563 --> 26:07.357
-So...
-[grunts]

26:07.440 --> 26:08.942
-How you doing?
-[inhales sharply]

26:09.818 --> 26:14.239
I'm great. Yeah. You know,
I'm thinking about buying a ranch.

26:15.573 --> 26:16.617
Things are awesome.

26:17.533 --> 26:18.785
Really?

26:18.869 --> 26:20.829
'Cause it's, like, 8:00 in the morning

26:20.912 --> 26:23.581
and you just poured two shots
of Jim Beam in your coffee...

26:24.249 --> 26:25.792
and the hood of your sweatshirt's
on the front.

26:27.502 --> 26:28.920
[chuckling]

26:30.797 --> 26:32.633
[laughs] I like it that way.

26:32.716 --> 26:35.468
That way, if I got to throw up,
it's like... [mimics retching]

26:38.138 --> 26:39.555
[chuckling]

26:41.683 --> 26:42.893
Look, Colt...

26:44.435 --> 26:46.562
it's okay to still be upset
about what happened.

26:48.189 --> 26:49.607
Is that what Abby said?

26:50.776 --> 26:51.777
I was upset?

26:52.819 --> 26:55.280
-No.
-[scoffs] God damn.

26:55.989 --> 26:57.323
I just know I am.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.575
-And that it comes out of nowhere.
-Yeah.

27:00.786 --> 27:03.705
Just the other day,
I was sitting at a stop light...

27:04.580 --> 27:06.792
and I saw this lady
pushing a baby stroller.

27:08.376 --> 27:10.295
And next thing you know, I'm crying,

27:10.378 --> 27:13.214
the car behind me is honking
and I flip 'em off.

27:15.216 --> 27:17.928
But it turned out it was an ambulance
and I felt even worse. [chuckles]

27:21.139 --> 27:22.891
Come on, don't things like that
happen to you?

27:25.560 --> 27:26.770
[smacks lips]

27:30.315 --> 27:32.525
Yeah, I'm sad sometimes.

27:33.526 --> 27:34.736
Is that what you want to hear?

27:35.486 --> 27:37.906
I don't want to hear anything, Colt.

27:39.324 --> 27:40.742
I'm trying to help you.

27:43.829 --> 27:46.247
Nobody knows better than me
the way this feels.

27:50.668 --> 27:52.838
That night I left you at the hospital...

27:56.257 --> 27:57.884
I cried the whole way home.

28:00.678 --> 28:02.138
I was angry.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.725
I was so upset.

28:07.602 --> 28:11.815
And I got into bed that night,
and I wanted the whole world to disappear.

28:16.194 --> 28:18.196
Then I woke up the next morning...

28:21.282 --> 28:22.909
and I... I felt...

28:28.289 --> 28:29.499
What?

28:31.126 --> 28:32.252
Tell me.

28:38.049 --> 28:39.342
I felt relieved.

28:42.929 --> 28:46.182
I didn't have to go to my job
at the Safeway that night.

28:48.977 --> 28:53.023
I didn't have to worry about money
or a bunch of stuff I was unprepared for.

28:53.899 --> 28:56.902
I didn't have to worry about
how having a baby with you

28:56.985 --> 28:58.945
was going to affect me and Abby.

29:03.825 --> 29:05.285
I hate myself.

29:07.412 --> 29:09.080
[sniffles] That's who I am.

29:11.249 --> 29:12.417
Colt...

29:16.922 --> 29:19.049
you have no reason to hate yourself.

29:22.385 --> 29:23.428
Of course I do.

29:24.805 --> 29:27.974
What kind of person's happy
about something like this?

29:33.438 --> 29:35.648
-You don't think I felt the same way?
-[sighs]

29:39.360 --> 29:43.198
Now I didn't have to worry about sticking
my mom with another kid in the house?

29:46.034 --> 29:47.743
I could ride horses again.

29:51.247 --> 29:52.874
Dating's a lot easier
when I don't have to say,

29:52.958 --> 29:56.627
"Hey, I'm Heather.
I'm carrying another guy's baby."

29:56.711 --> 29:57.712
[chuckles awkwardly]

30:04.385 --> 30:06.054
Doesn't that make you feel guilty?

30:08.807 --> 30:12.435
Sometimes... sure.

30:15.480 --> 30:18.316
It's definitely not something
I'd tell anybody else.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.070
-'Cause they wouldn't get it.
-[sobs]

30:24.239 --> 30:27.033
But after all that dark shit
we went through, Colt...

30:28.243 --> 30:29.660
[Colt sobbing]

30:32.455 --> 30:34.457
...that little bit of relief...

30:37.002 --> 30:39.087
-felt pretty damn good.
-[both chuckle]

30:40.671 --> 30:43.424
[sniffles] Yeah, it does.

30:49.973 --> 30:51.474
Just give yourself a break.

30:52.767 --> 30:53.977
[sighs]

30:54.727 --> 30:56.354
You're not a shitty person.

30:57.605 --> 30:59.690
-At least, not 'cause of that.
-[chuckling]

31:03.028 --> 31:04.654
You're a good guy, Colt.

31:07.823 --> 31:09.200
Don't be such a stranger.

31:11.036 --> 31:12.245
All right.

31:14.873 --> 31:16.082
[Colt sniffles]

31:19.585 --> 31:20.586
Thank you.

31:21.504 --> 31:22.505
[chuckles softly]

31:30.889 --> 31:32.098
Yeah.

31:33.892 --> 31:35.185
[sniffles] Heather?

31:36.019 --> 31:37.228
[Heather sighs]

31:37.938 --> 31:39.064
Yeah?

31:40.815 --> 31:42.525
Think we would have been good parents?

31:43.734 --> 31:44.777
[chuckles softly]

31:46.696 --> 31:47.697
No fucking way.

31:47.780 --> 31:49.199
[both chuckle]

31:53.703 --> 31:55.705
[country music playing]
