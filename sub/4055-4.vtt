12:51.771 --> 12:52.931
Find its location?

12:55.024 --> 12:56.730
It's my car, Anita.

12:56.859 --> 12:59.566
I want you to track it, please.

13:00.947 --> 13:03.984
The car is currently
driving north on Brook Street.

13:06.452 --> 13:07.828
It's noisy in here.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.570
Do you want to go outside
and talk?

13:10.707 --> 13:11.617
I can hear okay.

13:11.749 --> 13:15.162
CAROLINE: I mean,
do you want to go somewhere?

13:15.295 --> 13:16.580
Just you and me.

13:16.671 --> 13:19.629
Just you and me?

13:24.762 --> 13:27.253
Um, I-I do.

13:27.390 --> 13:31.008
Really -- Really do.

13:31.144 --> 13:32.680
But...

13:32.812 --> 13:34.427

13:34.564 --> 13:36.555
Of course you can.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.147
No,|cant

13:38.276 --> 13:40.608
There's...

13:40.737 --> 13:43.524
There's someone else.

13:43.656 --> 13:45.863
I think I like someone else.

13:48.494 --> 13:50.359
Your loss.

13:52.582 --> 13:54.493
Yeah.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.080
[Wine pouring]

13:58.212 --> 14:00.954
Where is it now?

14:01.090 --> 14:02.250
Edmund Street.

14:02.383 --> 14:05.921
It's been there for
three minutes and 28 seconds.

14:06.054 --> 14:08.887
Right, so she's parked.

14:09.015 --> 14:12.223
Where exactly is she?

14:12.352 --> 14:14.843
What house number?

14:14.979 --> 14:17.220
I don't have that information.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.268
Okay.

14:19.400 --> 14:25.236
Run a cross-check on
Laura's work and Edmund Street,

14:25.365 --> 14:27.856
see if anyone she works with
is living there.

14:27.992 --> 14:31.075
I can find no record
of anyone at Laura's firm

14:31.204 --> 14:34.116
living on Edmund Street.

14:34.248 --> 14:38.082
Is there anyone called Tom
living there?

14:39.253 --> 14:41.460
ANITA: There are three residents
on Edmund Street

14:41.589 --> 14:43.830
with the first name Thomas.

14:48.137 --> 14:49.843
I'm going over there.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.678
Don't do that, Joe.

14:58.356 --> 15:00.722
You don't know how this feels.

15:00.858 --> 15:03.474
How could you?
You can't feel.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.977
You got no idea.

15:09.242 --> 15:12.200
At 5:22 pm,
Laura dialed the landline

15:12.328 --> 15:14.239
to a Mrs. Alexandra Kennedy

15:14.372 --> 15:16.078
and confirmed a meeting
at her house this evening

15:16.207 --> 15:19.370
regarding her lawsuit.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.457
Thank you.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.250
I was surprised to hear
from you.

15:25.383 --> 15:27.544
Your firm told me
that I didn't have a case.

15:27.677 --> 15:29.167
Right, yes.
They did. We did.

15:29.303 --> 15:32.295
I just wanted to do a follow-up,
if that's okay.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.342
Oh, of course.

15:33.474 --> 15:35.965
I wanted to ask you both
some questions

15:36.102 --> 15:38.218
about what happened
at the theater.

15:38.354 --> 15:40.845
Well, we settled down
to watch the play.

15:40.982 --> 15:43.564
20 minutes in, an usher
comes along and tells me

15:43.693 --> 15:46.025
that I need to take Howard out.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.896
No synths allowed.

15:49.031 --> 15:52.819
But Howard's not just
some synth.

15:52.952 --> 15:54.943
In what way?

15:55.079 --> 15:57.456
He understands
what he's watching.

16:00.042 --> 16:02.419
Is it true, Howard?

16:02.545 --> 16:05.252
When you watch the plays,
what do you feel?

16:05.381 --> 16:06.496
HOWARD:
It depends.

16:06.632 --> 16:09.499
Sometimes plays
are supposed to make you laugh.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.297
Sometimes they're supposed to
make you cry.

16:12.430 --> 16:13.886
All plays are different.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.927
LAURA:
This play, then.

16:17.059 --> 16:20.517
How did it affect you
before you were thrown out?

16:20.646 --> 16:23.103
The story begins
when Willy Loman,

16:23.232 --> 16:24.563
a traveling salesman,

16:24.692 --> 16:28.150
returns to his family home
in Brooklyn, New York City.

16:28.279 --> 16:30.110
-His wife gets up to meet him.
-That's the plot, Howard.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.649
She --

16:31.782 --> 16:33.522
What did you feel?

16:50.301 --> 16:53.213
Sometimes wish my family came
with instructions.

16:55.806 --> 16:58.764
Or me.

17:08.986 --> 17:11.773
Can you feel awkwardness?

17:13.824 --> 17:15.689
Just as well.

17:17.828 --> 17:22.162
Wonder what it's like,
not feeling anything.

17:22.291 --> 17:26.250
It's got to drag, after a while,
hasn't it?

17:27.213 --> 17:29.795
I mean, what about this?

17:29.924 --> 17:31.915
This unlocks you,

17:32.051 --> 17:35.134
makes you...passionate.

17:35.263 --> 17:36.969
That's a feeling.

17:37.098 --> 17:39.555
It creates
the impression of passion.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.640
It's a simulation of an emotion.

17:41.769 --> 17:43.976
Yeah, but it's one of
the good ones,

17:44.105 --> 17:47.268
as far as I can remember.

17:48.859 --> 17:50.565
Do you want to try it?

17:50.695 --> 17:52.811
Just out of curiosity.

17:53.698 --> 17:57.532
I mean, we won't do anything,
obviously.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.901
Alex, he doesn't have
any human rights.

18:00.037 --> 18:00.822
You know that.

18:00.955 --> 18:05.198
Howard doesn't enjoy the play
any more than your wristwatch.

18:05.334 --> 18:07.711
He's just better
at convincing you.

18:07.837 --> 18:09.418
I'm not a madwoman.

18:09.547 --> 18:12.459
I don't believe
that Howard is a human.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.755
But I also don't believe
that he is an inanimate object

18:15.886 --> 18:18.969
that I should be ashamed
of having a connection with.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.089
We created these creatures.

18:21.225 --> 18:25.093
They walk and they talk
and they look and they smell

18:25.229 --> 18:28.096
and they become part of
our lives and families.

18:28.232 --> 18:31.315
They -- They are as close
to humans as can be,

18:31.444 --> 18:33.230
and yet still people insist

18:33.362 --> 18:36.069
that forming a relationship
with them,

18:36.198 --> 18:39.656
or treating them with dignity,
is somehow perverse.

18:39.785 --> 18:42.037
Well, we have created
a gray area, Mrs. Hawkins.

18:42.163 --> 18:44.870
We can't keep insisting
that they are just gadgets.

18:44.999 --> 18:47.240
They are more than that.

18:47.376 --> 18:50.789
We have made them more
than that.

"Rose. Mesmerize.

18:53.257 --> 18:54.918

18:57.678 --> 18:59.293
to enable activation.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.436

Summer. Sapphire.

It's kicking in.

19:20.242 --> 19:22.153
Did it work?

19:22.286 --> 19:26.029
Can you...fee| something?

19:30.461 --> 19:32.622
Yes.

19:34.507 --> 19:36.873
So, what happens now?

19:37.468 --> 19:39.959
Anything you want.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.359
Could you not take your daughter
with you next time?

20:04.495 --> 20:05.575
Do you have children?

20:05.705 --> 20:06.945
Yeah.

20:07.081 --> 20:08.821
People say
the human-synth relationship

20:08.958 --> 20:10.949
is complicated.

20:11.085 --> 20:13.121
Howard, sometimes plays

20:13.254 --> 20:16.621
are supposed to make you
frightened.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.998
Do you ever get scared?

20:19.135 --> 20:23.504
I am not built to feel fear,
Mrs. Hawkins.

don't mention this to --

to mention this to anyone.

21:31.457 --> 21:33.698
Do you...

21:33.834 --> 21:36.621
Do you need to clean up
or something?

21:36.754 --> 21:37.584
Yes.

21:37.713 --> 21:40.580
May I use the bathroom?

it will be 10:00 pm.

I'm required to turn
the volume of the music

22:05.199 --> 22:07.781
down to a lower decibel level.

22:07.910 --> 22:10.151
Fine.

get her chipped?

22:16.544 --> 22:18.580
Nah, he tried to,
but couldn't do it.

No, you're not doing that.

22:50.411 --> 22:52.026
Do you think it's normal

22:52.162 --> 22:53.823
to drag an unconscious woman
to a room and rape her?

22:53.956 --> 22:55.787
Is that standard party activity
foryou?

22:55.916 --> 22:57.156
She's not a real woman.

to put her dick in her?

for anything.

a diagnostics check tomorrow.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.470
Why?

23:53.599 --> 23:57.933
Because either there's something
wrong with her or me,

She chucked me out.

24:35.391 --> 24:37.552
It's over.

24:37.685 --> 24:40.427
Maybe she just needs
a bit of time on her own.

24:40.562 --> 24:42.848
She's not on her own, though,
is she?

24:42.982 --> 24:46.190
She's got Simon, the synth.

she's replaced you.

that's malfunctioning,

46:22.238 --> 46:23.148
that's all.

46:23.281 --> 46:25.738
She's more than that.

46:25.866 --> 46:28.448
Anita...

46:28.577 --> 46:32.411
who were you
before you came here?

46:35.209 --> 46:37.200
I'm sorry, Laura.

46:37.336 --> 46:38.872
I don't understand the question.

46:41.340 --> 46:44.047
I think you do.

46:51.892 --> 46:53.507
Thanks.

46:53.644 --> 46:56.556
You're welcome.

47:01.193 --> 47:04.731
Well, good night, Pete.

47:04.864 --> 47:06.946
Good night, Karen.

47:09.618 --> 47:11.950
