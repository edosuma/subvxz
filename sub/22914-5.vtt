00:06.290 --> 00:07.760
Previously on "Happy!"

00:08.060 --> 00:09.330
I'm Nick Sax, NYPD-ish.

00:09.760 --> 00:10.830
I'm trying to locate a man.

00:10.860 --> 00:12.400
Looks like Santa Claus.

00:12.430 --> 00:14.430
This password, it's actually
why we're all here.

00:14.460 --> 00:16.129
- And I'm the only one who...
- Knows the password.

00:16.170 --> 00:17.300
- Which is why...
- You gotta get dead.

00:18.640 --> 00:19.770
You guys are trying to kill me!

00:19.800 --> 00:20.840
Oh, no, Sax.

00:20.870 --> 00:22.210
We're gonna kill you.

00:23.340 --> 00:24.670
What do you want, Blue?

00:24.710 --> 00:25.840
You know what I want, Meredith.

00:25.880 --> 00:27.310
How is your ma?

00:27.340 --> 00:28.480
She been taking her medication?

00:28.510 --> 00:29.810
Don't worry.

00:29.850 --> 00:31.320
I've got a whole new way
into Nick Sax.

00:31.350 --> 00:33.480
You have an enemy in your house.

00:33.520 --> 00:37.190
This is the one who killed
your three sons.

00:37.220 --> 00:38.660
Three? There's four.

00:38.690 --> 00:41.190
Mikey is not with them.

00:41.230 --> 00:43.830
Your guy, Mr. Ho Ho Ho.

00:43.860 --> 00:47.160
He's under strict orders
to stay with the children.

00:47.200 --> 00:49.170
- Smoothie.
- The Bug is upset.

00:49.200 --> 00:50.870
And I need you to do
a scrub down.

00:50.900 --> 00:53.740
This is it, Nick! The dark room!

00:53.770 --> 00:56.210
Don't worry.
Happy and my dad are coming.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.410
They're going to save us.

00:57.440 --> 00:59.610
How will he find us now?

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074

01:11.790 --> 01:12.860
What the hell

01:12.890 --> 01:14.360
are you doing here?

01:14.390 --> 01:15.830
- Working a case.
- This ain't a homicide!

01:15.860 --> 01:18.760
A favor for a friend!

01:18.800 --> 01:20.800
For Amanda.

01:20.830 --> 01:22.600
Bullshit! She hates your guts.

01:22.630 --> 01:24.170
She'd never come to you.

01:24.200 --> 01:25.800
You're right.
She does hate my guts.

01:25.840 --> 01:28.210
And for all the right reasons.
But she loves her daughter.

01:28.240 --> 01:30.370
She loves Hailey.

01:35.280 --> 01:36.610
Why didn't she come to me?

01:36.650 --> 01:38.180
She tried.

01:43.190 --> 01:45.260
Let's go, Sax.

01:45.290 --> 01:47.760
We can work the case.

01:47.790 --> 01:51.160
Together.

01:51.200 --> 01:52.860
Just like old times.

01:56.970 --> 01:58.340
Well, well, well.

01:58.370 --> 02:00.900
You had me right up
to "old times."

02:00.940 --> 02:03.670
Let's try this again.
What's your angle?

02:06.880 --> 02:09.449
Merr, so predictable.

02:09.479 --> 02:11.680
You gotta go see Blue, Nick.

02:11.720 --> 02:14.180
He's really got you by the
short and curlies, doesn't he?

02:21.860 --> 02:23.260
Ow.

02:29.470 --> 02:33.270
Happy? Let's split.

02:43.510 --> 02:46.980
This was hers. Hailey's.

02:49.450 --> 02:52.290
Come on. Let's go find her.

03:01.330 --> 03:02.470
Why are you touching me?

03:02.500 --> 03:04.370
I've been waiting for you.

03:04.400 --> 03:06.740
I'm not in the mood to...
What the fuck is that?

03:06.770 --> 03:08.240
Cherry vape.

03:08.270 --> 03:09.640
I'm quitting the old nic sticks.

03:09.670 --> 03:11.710
I was starting to get
lines around my mouth.

03:12.910 --> 03:16.950
Let's be real. Hombre to hombre.

03:16.980 --> 03:19.550
I get it. You hate the show.

03:19.580 --> 03:21.350
But I just came from the morgue,

03:21.390 --> 03:23.920
and this dead son story
is heating up.

03:23.950 --> 03:27.260
And bro, you are
a big part of it.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.960
I am talking recurring guest.

03:28.990 --> 03:31.030
I am talking spin-off.

03:31.060 --> 03:34.330
Just, uh, sign this release

03:34.360 --> 03:37.270
and you can leave all that
mobster crap behind.

03:38.670 --> 03:42.340
That... crap?

03:42.370 --> 03:44.540
Cameras aren't rolling, dude.

03:44.570 --> 03:46.380
Celebrities are
the new mobsters.

03:46.410 --> 03:47.710
They make twice as much,

03:47.740 --> 03:49.780
and nobody expects them
to obey the law.

03:49.810 --> 03:52.650
You know, you gotta give up
this tired old idea of...

03:59.560 --> 04:01.890
Why would I wanna
leave all this behind?

04:06.000 --> 04:07.600
I love my work.

05:46.930 --> 05:49.400
Come, Dancer.

05:49.430 --> 05:52.500
Come. Come on.

05:52.540 --> 05:54.500
Come, Dasher! Yes!

05:54.540 --> 05:56.140
Come, Prancer! And Vixen!

On, Comet and Cupid!

06:05.950 --> 06:09.420
I know who's naughty
and who's nice.

06:09.450 --> 06:11.150
You are way too nice
to go in there.

06:12.720 --> 06:13.890
You wanna stay with me,
don't you?

06:13.920 --> 06:15.490
With my other nice kids?

06:15.530 --> 06:16.930
You wanna?

07:31.840 --> 07:35.840
6538 Rose Drive.
6536 Rose Drive.

07:35.870 --> 07:39.680
Oh, look! 6534,
we're almost home!

07:39.710 --> 07:42.610
You're almost home.

07:42.650 --> 07:44.280
I haven't seen Amanda
in ten years.

07:47.750 --> 07:49.750
Maybe this is a bad idea.

07:49.790 --> 07:52.090
We've been to a place
where girls slide

07:52.120 --> 07:54.890
up and down poles
in their birthday suits,

07:54.920 --> 07:56.830
where a teddy bear
plays with pee-pees,

07:56.860 --> 07:58.900
a restaurant that forgot
to cook the fish,

07:58.930 --> 08:01.630
and a few other places
I'm too shy to even talk about.

08:01.670 --> 08:05.000
And you think this
is a bad idea?

08:05.030 --> 08:09.310
Amanda and I didn't exactly
leave on the best of terms.

08:09.340 --> 08:10.940
Come on, Nick.

08:10.970 --> 08:12.740
You're a super cop
who knows the Big Apple

08:12.780 --> 08:14.010
better than anybody.

08:14.040 --> 08:16.610
She's a super mom
who knows Hailey

08:16.650 --> 08:17.910
better than anybody.

08:17.950 --> 08:19.880
We can't lose!

08:21.750 --> 08:23.050
Push it. Push the bell.

08:23.090 --> 08:24.720
Come on. Push it, Nick.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.820
Push the bell!
Give me a minute, will you?

08:27.790 --> 08:29.830
Wh... What's the matter, Nick?

08:31.830 --> 08:34.200
I've seen this look before.

08:34.230 --> 08:35.799
On Hailey's face right before

08:35.830 --> 08:38.200
riding the pirate ship
at the carnival.

08:38.230 --> 08:41.100
Are... Are you... Scared?

08:41.140 --> 08:42.870
God, I hate you.

08:42.909 --> 08:44.240
Oh, you are.

08:44.270 --> 08:46.310
Okay, you've kicked in the doors

08:46.340 --> 08:48.310
of the baddest baddies
in the Big Apple.

08:48.340 --> 08:49.580
Quit calling it the Big Apple.

08:49.610 --> 08:51.150
You sound like a moron.

08:51.180 --> 08:52.680
No one who lives in New York
calls it the Big Apple.

08:52.720 --> 08:54.150
I'm not from New York, Nick.

08:54.180 --> 08:57.250
I'm from Zork,
the capital of Cupcake Kingdom.

08:57.920 --> 08:59.690
I'm gonna say it again.
I hate you.

08:59.720 --> 09:02.830
Okay, Amanda is
the kindest, happiest,

09:02.860 --> 09:05.360
most understanding,
sweetest smelling lady...

09:05.390 --> 09:07.930
- Fine.
- In the whole wide world.

09:09.270 --> 09:11.000
Amanda... -

09:13.740 --> 09:15.240
Don't worry, partner.

09:15.270 --> 09:18.010
You'll see, she's going
to be so happy to see you.

09:22.780 --> 09:24.650
Hey, Amanda.

09:28.050 --> 09:31.120
Any more bold predictions,
Nostradamus?

09:59.050 --> 10:00.150
Does it work?

10:56.240 --> 10:58.370
"Sit up straight."

10:58.410 --> 11:00.380
"Eat your vegetables."

11:00.410 --> 11:03.410
"Put down that smartphone
or tablet."

11:03.450 --> 11:06.150
The common refrain of
the typical American parent.

11:06.180 --> 11:09.090
Does it sound familiar to you?

11:11.320 --> 11:12.860
No.

11:14.260 --> 11:15.760
Of course it does.

11:17.090 --> 11:19.760
But did you listen? No.

11:19.800 --> 11:23.330
You didn't. And now here we are.

11:23.370 --> 11:25.500
Starting today,
your little lives will change

11:25.530 --> 11:27.940
in ways you could never
have imagined.

11:27.970 --> 11:29.870
There will be moments when
you will wonder

11:29.910 --> 11:32.940
what you have done
to deserve these changes.

11:32.980 --> 11:35.180
Now, I'm sure you all feel
you've been good little boys

11:35.210 --> 11:36.910
and good little girls.

11:36.950 --> 11:39.320
But until now,
you have not known the meaning

11:39.350 --> 11:41.180
of true discipline.

11:41.220 --> 11:43.420
Of true obedience.

11:43.450 --> 11:46.090
Your parents were lax with you.

11:46.120 --> 11:49.090
Lax and careless.

11:49.130 --> 11:51.430
You have gotten away
with murder.

11:51.460 --> 11:54.860
Haven't you, my little
contraceptive mishaps?

11:56.370 --> 11:59.240
It's a rhetorical question.

11:59.270 --> 12:04.210
Yours is a generation without
respect or responsibility.

12:04.240 --> 12:07.810
An irrelevant,
fidgety generation.

12:07.840 --> 12:10.950
You've been medicated,
but never taught

12:10.980 --> 12:12.980
how to properly behave.

12:13.020 --> 12:16.220
In fact, I have never seen
a room of young faces

12:16.250 --> 12:19.890
in such dire need of correction.

12:19.920 --> 12:22.490
Perhaps that's why your
careless parents

12:22.530 --> 12:25.930
have delivered you to me.

12:28.560 --> 12:33.940
It's a really nice
pillow. And place.

12:33.970 --> 12:36.810
I mean, this is some, uh,
legit construction, here.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.010
Old school.

12:38.040 --> 12:39.240
Nice flooring and the oak trim.

12:39.280 --> 12:40.880
I mean, uh...

12:40.910 --> 12:43.380
It's not that Sheetrock,
uh, plywood crap.

12:43.410 --> 12:45.920
Bet it does a pretty decent job
keeping the winter away, huh?

12:45.950 --> 12:48.420
- I'm not a homesteader, Nick.
- Yeah, no.

12:48.450 --> 12:50.220
- It's a rental.
- Yeah.

12:50.250 --> 12:55.220
I'm just saying that,
uh, you've done good.

12:55.260 --> 12:57.160
Without you.

13:02.270 --> 13:04.530
Words are hard to find.

13:07.170 --> 13:09.510
Trying to understand what's
yours, what's mine.

13:09.540 --> 13:11.540
We find ourselves
in this moment together.

13:11.570 --> 13:13.180
This moment of time.

13:14.340 --> 13:16.610
Knowing in our heart
what needs to be said is,

13:16.650 --> 13:20.120
you know,
really just in our eyes.

13:20.150 --> 13:22.890
- You are unbelievable.
- What?

13:22.920 --> 13:28.590
- That's from our wedding song.
- I don't... It's...

13:29.630 --> 13:31.930
I don't think so.
Why are you here?

13:35.030 --> 13:36.270
Hailey.

13:36.300 --> 13:38.600
Merry told you?

13:58.050 --> 13:59.990
From September.

14:03.930 --> 14:07.000
- She doesn't look like me.
- She's yours.

14:08.460 --> 14:09.900
It's not what I meant.

14:13.140 --> 14:14.240
The eyes.

14:22.510 --> 14:25.280
You being pregnant
and not telling me, you know,

14:25.310 --> 14:27.580
I get it.

14:27.620 --> 14:30.050
Hailey being born,
leaving me out of it...

14:32.090 --> 14:34.960
I guess I get that, too.

14:34.990 --> 14:36.260
But goddamn it, Amanda.

14:36.290 --> 14:39.560
When they took her,
you go to Merry?

14:41.530 --> 14:44.970
That's right. I did.

14:45.000 --> 14:46.670
Looking for you.

14:46.700 --> 14:50.440
Can you imagine how
humiliating that was for me?

14:50.470 --> 14:54.380
- Uh...
- And where were you?

14:54.410 --> 14:57.250
Faded, probably?

14:57.280 --> 14:59.050
Pills? -

14:59.080 --> 15:00.280
- Coke?
- I...

15:00.320 --> 15:03.250
Booze? Maybe all of the above?

15:03.290 --> 15:06.290
Or maybe... just maybe...
putting a bullet

15:06.320 --> 15:09.030
in some poor bastard
for a little cash.

15:10.090 --> 15:12.200
That's right. I hear things.

15:12.230 --> 15:14.160
Things that I didn't
wanna believe.

15:14.200 --> 15:15.400
But looking at you now...

15:17.700 --> 15:19.270
She's my daughter.

15:21.670 --> 15:25.370
I've done everything I could
in the last ten years

15:25.410 --> 15:29.150
to keep her from being
your daughter.

15:48.760 --> 15:51.030
And that's exactly
how I want to keep it.

15:52.500 --> 15:54.270
It is my job to keep her safe.

15:54.300 --> 15:57.440
And keeping her safe means
keeping you out of our lives.

15:57.470 --> 15:59.010
She's not safe!

16:04.650 --> 16:06.750
I mean, think about it, Nicky.

16:06.780 --> 16:09.750
Look at the dumpster fire
that your life has become

16:09.790 --> 16:12.120
and ask yourself
how I could rely on you.

16:12.160 --> 16:13.690
How anyone could rely on you.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.720
Just trying to protect...

16:17.360 --> 16:20.200
Destroying lives
and abandoning people?

16:20.230 --> 16:23.570
All you do is bring chaos
and violence and destruction

16:23.600 --> 16:24.800
to everything you touch.
Well, that's

16:24.830 --> 16:27.070
a little bit of an exaggeration.

Ah, what the hell
did I do that for?

18:23.190 --> 18:24.320
No! No!

18:24.350 --> 18:27.590
Nick! Nick! Not here, please!

18:29.730 --> 18:32.300
This is Hailey's special place!

18:34.760 --> 18:36.300
No!

18:36.330 --> 18:38.400
Not Hailey's blankie!

18:57.650 --> 19:01.890
Oh, first place!

19:01.920 --> 19:05.260
Uh, I know this Puerto Rican
fella in my building.

19:05.290 --> 19:08.960
He can really do wonders
with all the stains.

19:09.000 --> 19:12.940
- Get out.
- Let me help, Amanda.

19:12.970 --> 19:15.500
911. What's your emergency?

19:15.540 --> 19:19.610
- Please let me help.
- Hello?

19:19.640 --> 19:20.880
Hello?

19:20.910 --> 19:24.650
- Please.
- Get out of our house.

19:24.680 --> 19:26.250
If this is a non-emergency,

19:26.280 --> 19:28.520
please call the non-emergency
number.

19:28.550 --> 19:32.490
What is your location?

19:32.520 --> 19:34.690
Is anyone there?

20:00.950 --> 20:04.820
How the hell did this happen?

20:04.850 --> 20:10.560
Oh, I remember a trampoline.

20:10.590 --> 20:12.360
Mm.

20:12.400 --> 20:14.560
Was there a slip and slide?

20:21.370 --> 20:24.470
Too much sun. Too soon,
too early, too much.

20:24.510 --> 20:26.710
Mm, something's burning.

20:30.880 --> 20:32.750
Someone broke our window.

20:40.560 --> 20:44.830
I think I know who
broke our window.

20:44.860 --> 20:49.700
Oh, master detective.

20:49.730 --> 20:51.530
I have a great idea.

20:51.570 --> 20:54.600
Sleep, bloodies,
do it all over again.

20:54.640 --> 20:56.970
Mm. Sleep, yes.

20:57.010 --> 21:00.010
Bloodies...

21:00.040 --> 21:01.740
Maybe.

21:01.780 --> 21:03.880
You know we're gonna
look back fondly on this...

21:03.910 --> 21:08.050
On a complete blank.

21:12.390 --> 21:14.990
You're gonna miss it
when it's gone.

22:21.920 --> 22:24.830
Eight voicemails? Overkill?

22:24.860 --> 22:26.060
You're here, aren't you?

22:26.090 --> 22:27.130
Maybe pick up the
phone next time,

22:27.160 --> 22:28.660
save us all a little trouble.

22:28.700 --> 22:30.030
I was indisposed.

22:30.070 --> 22:32.540
Yeah. We heard.

22:32.570 --> 22:34.570
Bitches, I get that
getting jerked around

22:34.600 --> 22:36.040
by Internal Affairs all morning

22:36.070 --> 22:37.710
is a part of my official
job description,

22:37.740 --> 22:39.440
but can we please
get to the fucking point?

22:39.480 --> 22:41.080
The language on this one.

22:41.110 --> 22:42.650
You suck your captain's dick
with that mouth?

22:42.680 --> 22:46.450
Exactly what do you think
your job is, McCarthy?

22:46.480 --> 22:48.620
Working in partnership
with the community

22:48.650 --> 22:51.850
to enforce the law, preserve...
Homicide.

22:51.890 --> 22:53.620
You work homicide.

22:53.660 --> 22:56.430
How's the Scaramucci
investigation going, McCarthy?

22:56.460 --> 22:57.830
- It's ongoing.
- Ongoing?

22:57.860 --> 22:59.900
You know who fucking did it.
Nick Sax.

22:59.930 --> 23:01.530
That's who you should
be out looking for.

23:01.560 --> 23:03.700
Instead, you seem
to have demoted yourself

23:03.730 --> 23:05.130
to kiddie kidnapping.

23:05.170 --> 23:07.000
Missing Persons.
Great band in the '80s.

23:07.040 --> 23:09.470
Not your department.

23:12.110 --> 23:13.740
Nothing to say for yourself?

23:13.780 --> 23:17.180
What are words for
when no one listens anymore?

23:21.650 --> 23:25.220
McCarthy, this
insubordinate routine

23:25.250 --> 23:28.460
can work really badly
against you.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.530
You remember what happened
to Sax, right?

23:30.560 --> 23:31.790
Yeah.

23:31.830 --> 23:33.600
I remember what you two
did to him.

23:33.630 --> 23:35.630
Oh come on, if ever
there was an architect

23:35.660 --> 23:37.930
of his own spectacular
demise, it was Nick Sax.

23:37.970 --> 23:40.470
Dude was a walking downward
spiral, and you know it.

23:40.500 --> 23:42.140
Only a matter of time.

23:42.170 --> 23:44.540
Guess when you look at it
like that,

23:44.570 --> 23:45.970
what's a little planted evidence

23:46.010 --> 23:49.980
to help things along, right?

23:50.010 --> 23:54.080
You want us to get to the
fucking point, so here it is.

23:54.120 --> 23:57.250
This whole kidnapping angle,

23:57.290 --> 24:00.190
you want to steer
wide clear of that.

24:00.220 --> 24:03.030
Sometimes kids go missing.

24:03.060 --> 24:04.990
It's a tragedy.

24:05.030 --> 24:09.230
Sometimes we find them.
Sometimes we don't.

24:09.260 --> 24:11.270
You understand, McCarthy?

24:11.300 --> 24:14.840
Sometimes they just
stay missing.

24:21.680 --> 24:26.110
So this is a message from Blue.

24:26.150 --> 24:28.920
Blue? Who's that?

24:28.950 --> 24:30.650
You know who she's
talking about, Hubble?

24:30.690 --> 24:32.560
Hmm.

24:32.590 --> 24:34.290
Without getting too graphic,

24:34.320 --> 24:37.560
how the hell do you bitches
sleep at night?

24:37.590 --> 24:41.700
Not on our father's graves.

24:41.730 --> 24:44.170
That is him on that wall,
isn't it?

24:44.200 --> 24:46.030
Behind you? - Wall of Heroes.

24:46.070 --> 24:49.940
He was a good cop, McCarthy.
Anyway, that's what I hear.

24:49.970 --> 24:52.070
Cut down in the line of duty.

24:52.110 --> 24:54.110
Mm. Makes you sick, doesn't it?

24:54.140 --> 24:55.910
He must've been so proud of you.

24:55.940 --> 24:57.550
Yeah, I bet he was.

24:57.580 --> 25:01.880
And I bet I know what
he would tell you right now.

25:01.920 --> 25:06.190
He would tell you to stay
off of that wall.

25:06.220 --> 25:08.120
Do what you have to do.

25:08.160 --> 25:11.990
Do whatever you have to do.

25:12.030 --> 25:13.260
But stay off that wall.

25:19.030 --> 25:21.870
One by one.

25:21.900 --> 25:23.810
Single file.

25:23.840 --> 25:28.140
Mmm. Delicious.

25:28.180 --> 25:30.180
Oh, no.

25:30.210 --> 25:32.780
No fattening up for you.
Go, sit.

25:36.620 --> 25:38.750
Aren't you lucky?

25:38.790 --> 25:44.230
Some of us were born with
refined sugar allergies.

25:44.260 --> 25:47.860
No sprinkles or frosting
on Christmas.

25:49.060 --> 25:54.170
Just hives and running sores.

26:03.180 --> 26:05.050
What's the matter?

26:05.080 --> 26:07.920
I'm not hungry.

26:07.950 --> 26:09.720
Perhaps you once
had a piece of cake

26:09.750 --> 26:11.190
that didn't agree with you.

26:21.360 --> 26:24.830
Go on, eat it. It's good.

26:29.270 --> 26:32.840
I don't think Happy
and your dad are coming.

26:51.260 --> 26:52.430
Try and lend a helping hand,

26:52.460 --> 26:54.360
the world wipes its ass with it.

26:54.400 --> 26:56.130
She didn't want my help, nah.

26:56.160 --> 26:59.000
It's half-off sushi Saturday
at a very adequate strip joint

26:59.030 --> 27:00.300
not too far from here.

27:00.340 --> 27:02.300
I can practically
smell the spicy tuna.

27:02.340 --> 27:04.370
I guess Amanda was pretty
hard on you,

27:04.410 --> 27:07.140
but mommies can
have bad days too.

27:07.180 --> 27:08.440
Anybody can.

27:08.480 --> 27:10.680
What's the matter with you?

27:10.710 --> 27:11.980
What do you... ah!

27:12.010 --> 27:13.280
You didn't tell me you shed.
Don't shed!

27:13.320 --> 27:14.720
I don't like animals that shed!

27:17.990 --> 27:19.860
Look, I don't blame you
for feeling sad, Nick.

27:19.890 --> 27:23.260
If I were you, I'd want
to just poof! Disappear!

27:23.290 --> 27:24.390
At least for a little while.

27:24.430 --> 27:26.800
Why not forever?

27:26.830 --> 27:29.330
Wh-whenever I'm feeling down,
I go back to basics,

27:29.360 --> 27:31.470
I think of ways to help Hailey.

27:31.500 --> 27:33.270
That's why I became an
imaginary friend after all!

27:33.300 --> 27:36.000
You know, the best way to
forget about your own problems

27:36.040 --> 27:38.470
is to do something nice
for someone else.

27:38.510 --> 27:41.480
That's why Christmas
is so awesome-sauce, Nick.

27:41.510 --> 27:44.280
Everyone full of holiday spirit

27:44.310 --> 27:46.250
and goodwill toward
their fellow man.

27:46.280 --> 27:48.780
That holly, jolly time of year

27:48.820 --> 27:50.490
when people can pack up
their troubles

27:50.520 --> 27:51.890
in an old doggy poop bag,

27:51.920 --> 27:54.120
and really be their truest self.

27:54.160 --> 27:56.020
Their true self?

27:56.060 --> 27:57.430
Really?

27:57.460 --> 27:58.430
Is that what you think?

27:58.460 --> 28:00.000
Well, yeah.

28:00.030 --> 28:03.230
Yeah, good luck with that.
I'm out of here.

28:03.270 --> 28:05.070
Not so fast, Nick!

28:07.300 --> 28:10.140
I think someone forgot
his Christmas spirit.

28:10.170 --> 28:11.910
What have I told you?

28:11.940 --> 28:13.440
"By failing to prepare,
you are preparing to fail."

28:13.480 --> 28:15.210
That's right,
and when I coined that phrase,

28:15.240 --> 28:17.010
it changed my life.
I think it was Benjamin-

28:17.050 --> 28:20.050
- God, what a year
we've had, huh?

28:20.080 --> 28:21.320
So many ups and downs.

28:21.350 --> 28:24.120
I've never been more in love.

28:24.150 --> 28:27.020
No peeking.

28:27.060 --> 28:28.790
Aww, you see, Nick?

28:28.820 --> 28:33.100
You see? The spirit of
Christmas is everywhere!

28:34.530 --> 28:36.200
Ladies and gentlemen,
we apologize

28:36.230 --> 28:38.000
for any inconvenience.

28:38.030 --> 28:40.900
All Queens-bound trains have
been delayed indefinitely.

28:40.940 --> 28:43.170
Oh, this city never disappoints.

28:43.210 --> 28:45.170
Is a show about to start?

28:45.210 --> 28:47.340
Oh, yeah. You just watch.

28:47.380 --> 28:50.550
All it takes is a little
inconvenience and...

28:50.580 --> 28:52.350
then you start to see them.

28:52.380 --> 28:53.920
See who?

28:53.950 --> 28:55.820
Truest selves.

28:55.850 --> 28:57.450
Go on, Tinkerbell. Take a look.

28:57.490 --> 28:59.350
Little lap around.

28:59.390 --> 29:00.860
See how much humanity you find

29:00.890 --> 29:03.160
when the A train
ain't running on time.

29:04.360 --> 29:05.830
Seriously!

29:06.530 --> 29:08.100
Come on.

29:31.420 --> 29:34.190
What the hell do
I pay taxes for?

29:34.220 --> 29:36.960
Oh, I forgot. It's up to the
ass kickers in this world

29:36.990 --> 29:39.190
to subsidize handouts
for the deadbeats.

29:39.230 --> 29:40.530
What area code's 602?

29:40.560 --> 29:43.000
Ugh, new client.

29:43.030 --> 29:46.400
I didn't ask who it was,
I asked what area code it is.

29:46.430 --> 29:48.040
You stole it?

29:48.070 --> 29:53.940
Gee whiz, the old
five finger discount.

29:53.980 --> 29:55.240
Nick!

29:55.280 --> 29:57.310
Uh, what are you doing?
Get off the tracks.

29:57.350 --> 30:01.620
Mm. Do you smell that?

30:01.650 --> 30:05.120
All the Christmas spirit
in the air.

30:05.150 --> 30:07.520
You could practically
choke on it.

30:07.560 --> 30:11.530
You scratch the surface,
and there you have it:

30:11.560 --> 30:14.130
our true selves.

30:14.160 --> 30:18.030
People hiding behind their
bright, colorful wrappings

30:18.070 --> 30:19.600
of bullshit.

30:19.630 --> 30:22.140
Hoping that it'll hide
what they really are

30:22.170 --> 30:25.910
deep down inside
underneath it all.

30:25.940 --> 30:28.240
Empty boxes and broken toys.

30:28.280 --> 30:29.910
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:29.950 --> 30:31.580
we apologize
for any inconvenience.

30:31.610 --> 30:34.450
The next Queens-bound train
will be arriving

30:34.480 --> 30:36.480
in two minutes.

30:37.620 --> 30:39.920
Uh, Nick, the train is coming.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.160
Yep.

30:41.190 --> 30:43.190
Yeah, so why don't
you get off the tracks?

30:43.230 --> 30:45.530
Nope.

30:45.560 --> 30:47.600
I'm gonna teach you a lesson,

30:47.630 --> 30:51.070
my little blue bastard.

30:51.100 --> 30:52.600
Something you're
never gonna forget.

30:52.630 --> 30:54.300
I'm gonna lie down
here on these tracks,

30:54.340 --> 30:56.340
and I'm gonna let that train
run me right over,

30:56.370 --> 31:01.340
and I guarantee you not one SOB
on that whole platform

31:01.380 --> 31:02.580
will lift a finger to help me.

31:02.610 --> 31:04.210
Nick! No!

31:06.380 --> 31:11.450
Help! Help! Help!

31:11.490 --> 31:13.290
Mom!

31:13.320 --> 31:15.560
- Please! Someone help!
- You drove me to this.

31:15.590 --> 31:17.330
Your man whore can wait!

31:17.360 --> 31:18.930
Dump what's left of your
career in a cardboard box.

31:18.960 --> 31:19.960
Merry Christmas! - Help!

31:20.000 --> 31:22.930
Help, please! Help!

31:22.970 --> 31:24.670
All right, Nick.
Get up, you win!

31:24.700 --> 31:25.970
How's it looking up there?

31:26.000 --> 31:27.940
Awful! You made your point!

31:27.970 --> 31:30.110
Not quite. Not until I give
these walls a new paint job.

31:30.140 --> 31:32.310
But, Nick! What about Hailey?

31:32.340 --> 31:35.240
Hailey. Hailey.

31:35.280 --> 31:37.450
Don't you try
and put this on me!

31:37.480 --> 31:39.980
You were the one with her
when she was kidnapped!

31:40.020 --> 31:41.550
What have you done?

31:41.580 --> 31:43.250
I found you.

31:43.290 --> 31:45.120
Yeah, well.

31:45.150 --> 31:48.060
How's that working out for you?

31:49.290 --> 31:50.990
You're right, Nick.

31:51.030 --> 31:52.590
This is your kind of world.

31:52.630 --> 31:55.260
Not a world
for soft things like me,

31:55.300 --> 31:57.000
like Hailey.

31:57.030 --> 32:00.340
You've opened my eyes to a lot
of stuff I never wanted to see.

32:00.370 --> 32:02.140
But I won't watch you do this.

32:02.170 --> 32:05.240
If you want me to go, fine.
I'll... I'll disappear.

32:05.270 --> 32:07.410
Music to my ears.

32:07.440 --> 32:08.540
Bye-bye.

32:08.580 --> 32:11.350
All right, then.

32:11.380 --> 32:13.350
Goodbye, partner.

32:23.530 --> 32:26.160
Oh, come on now, really?

32:27.330 --> 32:28.600
God, I hate my heart.

32:36.740 --> 32:38.640
This homeless dude's
having a heart attack!

32:38.670 --> 32:40.580
Does anyone know CPR?

32:40.610 --> 32:42.610
Someone call 9-1-1!

32:45.280 --> 32:47.320
Okay, all right.

32:48.650 --> 32:50.050
I'm fine. I'm fine.

32:50.090 --> 32:51.790
Get your hands off me, Jesus.

32:51.820 --> 32:54.160
You really should be
in the hospital.

32:54.190 --> 32:56.720
Aw, shut up.

32:56.760 --> 32:58.760
We saved him!
It's a Christmas miracle!

33:17.150 --> 33:18.110
Feel it.

33:18.350 --> 33:20.250
- Isabella.
- Si.

33:20.280 --> 33:22.120
What do you think we're doing?

33:22.150 --> 33:25.290
We're making Mikey's favorite
meatballs and sauce,

33:25.320 --> 33:26.790
just like you said.

33:26.820 --> 33:28.420
No.

33:28.460 --> 33:30.260
You are a mother,

33:30.290 --> 33:34.060
calling for the soul
of your son.

33:34.100 --> 33:37.630
And how are you gonna
get him back?

33:37.670 --> 33:40.670
Here! Here! Feel it!

33:40.700 --> 33:42.540
- Feel it!
- Okay, okay.

33:42.570 --> 33:46.410
Feel it!

33:46.440 --> 33:48.810
- Va bene. Isabella?
- Mm-hmm?

33:48.840 --> 33:52.610
What's the most important
ingredient in that sauce?

33:52.650 --> 33:55.820
- Oh, garlic.
- No.

33:55.850 --> 33:57.790
A mother's soul.

33:57.820 --> 34:00.220
A mother's love.

34:00.260 --> 34:03.090
Only through a mother's love,

34:03.130 --> 34:05.790
the aroma of this flesh,

34:05.830 --> 34:09.230
can waft to the spirit world

34:09.260 --> 34:12.830
that will free Mikey
of his purgatories.

34:12.870 --> 34:18.510
That, and a few drops
of my menstrual blood.

34:20.380 --> 34:21.510
Oh, yeah.

34:21.540 --> 34:24.880
Uh... Um...

34:31.790 --> 34:34.460
I just threw up in my mouth.

35:08.360 --> 35:10.230
You told him.

35:13.730 --> 35:18.230
When I found Sax,
he was already looking for her.

35:18.270 --> 35:21.540
We missed Hailey by minutes.

35:21.570 --> 35:23.410
He was there?

35:23.440 --> 35:25.740
With you?

35:25.770 --> 35:29.580
Amanda, you're gonna
have to lay low for a while.

35:29.610 --> 35:30.910
Excuse me?

35:30.950 --> 35:32.780
This thing, it's bigger
than I thought.

35:32.810 --> 35:34.280
I'm not sure how deep it goes,

35:34.320 --> 35:37.220
but there are powerful
people involved.

35:37.250 --> 35:40.960
People who will not think twice
about making you disappear.

35:40.990 --> 35:43.230
Disappear?

35:43.260 --> 35:45.330
Without Hailey,
there is nothing left

35:45.360 --> 35:47.300
of me to disappear.

35:51.800 --> 35:53.800
It is what it is.

35:53.840 --> 35:56.270
I've already overstepped
by involving you.

35:56.300 --> 35:59.470
So you're asking me
to do what, exactly?

35:59.510 --> 36:00.940
Sit here quietly,
waiting for a knock

36:00.980 --> 36:02.940
on what's left of my front door
telling me she's dead?

36:02.980 --> 36:05.510
I know it's not easy,
but seven other sets of parents

36:05.550 --> 36:07.580
are doing that exact same thing.

36:09.280 --> 36:12.390
Please let me handle it.

36:17.590 --> 36:21.300
You're not handling anything.

36:21.330 --> 36:22.630
You're afraid.

36:26.730 --> 36:30.310
I threw the wrong person
out of my house.

36:30.340 --> 36:32.610
Amanda.

36:45.720 --> 36:49.460
Hey, hey, come on back, Happy.

36:49.490 --> 36:51.660
Come on, Hap.

36:54.830 --> 36:57.270
All right, all right.
Enough of the drama, come on.

36:57.300 --> 36:59.700
- Come on back.
- Bye, guys, see you tomorrow!

37:03.410 --> 37:04.870
All right, you were right,
all right?

37:04.910 --> 37:07.010
I mean, well, you know,
for the most part.

37:07.040 --> 37:10.750
I mean, not all people are bad,
they're just...

37:10.780 --> 37:13.620
God damned annoying
most of the time.

37:13.650 --> 37:16.580
So come on.

37:16.620 --> 37:18.020
Hap!

37:18.050 --> 37:20.290
Happy!

37:23.020 --> 37:27.700
Ah, shit. I killed my kid's
imaginary friend.

37:27.730 --> 37:31.070
No "Nutcracker"
for me this year.

37:31.100 --> 37:33.940
Chicken and lamb combo.
Extra onions.

37:33.970 --> 37:36.600
Need five minutes.
White sauce? Hot sauce?

37:36.640 --> 37:39.410
Give him both! It's Christmas!

37:41.340 --> 37:47.780

37:47.820 --> 37:50.820

37:55.420 --> 38:00.960

38:10.670 --> 38:12.640

38:12.670 --> 38:15.010
Happiest time of the year.

38:15.040 --> 38:18.580
Oh good. You two have met.

38:18.610 --> 38:21.080
We can get right down to
tomorrow night's business.

38:25.550 --> 38:27.520
Yeah, no. I don't think so.

38:27.560 --> 38:28.760
I beg your pardon?

38:28.790 --> 38:30.530
I ain't working
with Kris Kringle here.

38:30.560 --> 38:32.790
I mean, as a general guideline,
I prefer to work alone,

38:32.830 --> 38:34.630
but when an obvious
total psychopath

38:34.660 --> 38:38.000
is involved... no.

38:43.000 --> 38:44.770
Don't be silly, Nick.

38:48.580 --> 38:50.480
This is one of my best men.

38:50.510 --> 38:53.380
You two are gonna get along
like a pair of tits.

38:56.580 --> 38:59.420
Non-negotiable.

38:59.450 --> 39:04.460
Well, deck the halls
with boughs of holy shit.

39:04.490 --> 39:06.860
I knew that asshole
looked familiar.

39:09.900 --> 39:13.130
That means...

39:13.170 --> 39:14.470
Blue.

39:17.470 --> 39:19.540
He's been behind it
the whole time.

39:21.510 --> 39:24.650
Blue!

39:24.680 --> 39:26.580
Blue?

39:26.610 --> 39:29.620
Mikey?

39:36.090 --> 39:38.690
Shit's just getting weirder
and weirder.
