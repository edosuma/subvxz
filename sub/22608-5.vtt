00:36.000 --> 00:37.480
North Africa.

00:55.880 --> 00:59.125
High in Morocco's Atlas Mountains,

00:59.160 --> 01:03.200
Barbary macaques shiver
in the icy cedars.

01:12.800 --> 01:15.685
The ancestors of
these monkeys fled here

01:15.720 --> 01:19.360
from a disaster that
overwhelmed their homeland.

01:21.600 --> 01:25.080
Now, trapped in this
isolated corner of Africa,

01:25.115 --> 01:28.560
there's no going back to
the land farther south.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.960
Even in this snowy refuge,

01:33.995 --> 01:35.085
there's a reminder

01:35.120 --> 01:36.520
of what drove them here.

01:42.800 --> 01:46.400
The unbridled power
of the African sun.

01:54.120 --> 01:56.605
Under its intense gaze,

01:56.640 --> 01:58.560
the snow can't last for long.

02:05.400 --> 02:09.280
Melt water should bring
life to the lowlands.

02:12.560 --> 02:15.760
Hundreds of torrents
cascade southwards.

02:18.040 --> 02:21.760
But each is flowing
towards extinction.

02:26.600 --> 02:29.680
Just 200 miles south
of the mountains,

02:29.715 --> 02:32.120
the rivers are vaporised.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.600
Life has been burnt off the land.

02:50.000 --> 02:54.160
This was the apocalypse from
which the Barbary macaques fled.

02:55.920 --> 02:58.880
The sudden and unstoppable advance

02:58.915 --> 03:01.840
of the greatest desert on the planet.

03:14.480 --> 03:17.560
The Sahara transformed North Africa.

03:19.320 --> 03:21.045
Today, it covers an area

03:21.080 --> 03:23.325
the size of the United States.

03:23.360 --> 03:26.360
One-third of the entire
African continent.

03:32.480 --> 03:36.320
This is one of the
hottest places on Earth.

03:44.280 --> 03:46.165
The merciless sun,

03:46.200 --> 03:49.700
a colossal 15-million-degree
nuclear reactor,

03:49.735 --> 03:53.200
blasted life from the
surface of the land.

03:57.400 --> 03:59.645
It still wreaks havoc.

03:59.680 --> 04:03.120
A faint breath of wind can
be the beginning of disaster.

04:49.040 --> 04:53.160
Nomads tell of entire
villages being engulfed...

04:54.720 --> 04:56.725
.. camel trains disappearing,

04:56.760 --> 05:01.000
and people buried alive
inside their tents.

05:50.680 --> 05:55.280
A sandstorm can be
1,000 miles across.

05:58.600 --> 06:04.000
It seems miraculous that anything
can survive such devastation.

06:07.720 --> 06:12.400
The Saharan apocalypse
wiped out many creatures,

06:12.435 --> 06:15.125
but, today, some still cling on,

06:15.160 --> 06:18.440
in the lands around the
margins of the great desert.

06:23.040 --> 06:24.480
It's very dry here.

06:25.640 --> 06:28.800
Some years, the rains fail entirely.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.040
A lone Grevy's zebra.

06:43.240 --> 06:46.045
He weighs close to half a tonne,

06:46.080 --> 06:49.320
and could go for three
days without drinking.

06:54.560 --> 06:56.125
Like the macaques,

06:56.160 --> 06:59.480
his forebears were refugees
from the advancing Sahara.

07:05.200 --> 07:07.560
The land is scrubby and dry.

07:13.040 --> 07:15.800
But this stallion has
claimed it as his own.

07:18.120 --> 07:20.560
He's been waiting
months for visitors.

07:22.080 --> 07:23.560
Female visitors.

07:32.280 --> 07:34.100
If they like his territory,

07:34.135 --> 07:35.920
they might stay a while.

07:40.800 --> 07:45.320
It's his first chance to
mate for a very long time.

07:57.280 --> 07:58.725
HE BRAYS

07:58.760 --> 08:00.120
Hardly a success.

08:02.240 --> 08:06.000
Perhaps his visitors are looking
for a more impressive partner.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.240
There's another setback.

08:13.040 --> 08:15.080
The females were being followed,

08:15.115 --> 08:17.297
a posse of young males,

08:17.332 --> 08:19.480
every one, a rival.

08:25.520 --> 08:28.800
It's time to separate
the men from the boys.

08:38.919 --> 08:40.520
HE SNORTS

08:44.440 --> 08:45.720
HE BRAYS

08:51.000 --> 08:52.800
HE BRAYS

08:54.520 --> 08:57.800
One by one, the
stallion sees them off.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.720
HE BRAYS

09:21.560 --> 09:24.080
The females had ringside seats.

09:26.000 --> 09:29.640
And his prowess has not gone unnoted.

09:36.720 --> 09:39.680
Machismo gives way to tenderness.

09:56.880 --> 10:00.440
Around here, you have to
take every opportunity,

10:00.475 --> 10:03.920
be it for food, for
water or for mates.

10:14.880 --> 10:17.600
Female Grevy's are a fickle bunch.

10:17.635 --> 10:20.320
The herd have decided to move on.

10:22.080 --> 10:23.760
All of them.

10:23.795 --> 10:25.405
HE NEIGHS

10:25.440 --> 10:28.445
The stallion may
never see them again.

10:28.480 --> 10:32.760
But there's a chance that
one is now carrying his foal.

10:35.040 --> 10:39.320
In this harsh land THAT
must count as a triumph.

10:48.240 --> 10:52.560
The sun's power cannot,
however, reach far underground.

10:54.560 --> 10:56.885
Below, in stark contrast,

10:56.920 --> 10:59.880
conditions are stable and tolerable.

11:02.240 --> 11:05.800
And home to one of the
planet's strangest mammals.

11:10.320 --> 11:12.760
Meet the naked mole rats.

11:18.960 --> 11:24.240
These sabre-toothed sausages
wouldn't last a day in the desert.

11:25.760 --> 11:28.125
Special filming
tunnels allow us to see

11:28.160 --> 11:31.240
how well adapted they are
to the subterranean life.

11:31.275 --> 11:34.200
They can run equally
well in both directions,

11:34.235 --> 11:36.240
so tight space is no problem.

11:41.240 --> 11:43.040
They have lost their fur.

11:45.360 --> 11:48.680
And, most bizarrely, they
live in social colonies,

11:48.715 --> 11:51.800
much like termites or ants.

11:55.600 --> 11:57.285
After time spent digging,

11:57.320 --> 11:59.680
the workers come together to relax.

12:11.680 --> 12:15.520
But one here is very
different from all the rest.

12:17.560 --> 12:18.720
Their queen.

12:20.600 --> 12:22.805
Twice as heavy as her subjects,

12:22.840 --> 12:25.840
and not afraid to
throw her weight around.

12:30.000 --> 12:33.600
She is the mother of
every worker in the colony,

12:33.635 --> 12:37.200
and exists in a near-continuous
state of pregnancy.

12:39.960 --> 12:44.680
Even now, two dozen babies are
pulsating within her swollen belly.

12:50.680 --> 12:52.205
Just occasionally,

12:52.240 --> 12:54.840
one of her brood is
raised differently.

12:56.040 --> 12:59.120
A daughter becomes a princess.

13:03.200 --> 13:08.120
Until now, this youngster's
enjoyed a lazy, privileged life.

13:08.155 --> 13:10.000
But not for much longer.

13:15.120 --> 13:17.960
She has a destiny to fulfil.

13:25.520 --> 13:29.960
The surface is a place where no
naked mole rat can survive for long.

13:37.800 --> 13:42.280
But a princess will risk
everything to search for a partner.

13:51.240 --> 13:53.080
The quest is urgent.

13:59.520 --> 14:00.925
IT SNIFFS

14:00.960 --> 14:03.760
There's an enticing smell in the air.

14:12.520 --> 14:16.680
A seductive scent draws
her downwards, to safety.

14:28.800 --> 14:31.040
She's sniffed out a partner.

14:34.440 --> 14:36.285
He too is alone,

14:36.320 --> 14:40.040
and eager to start a new
colony in his lonely burrow.

14:43.400 --> 14:44.965
Two months later,

14:45.000 --> 14:47.360
the princess has become a queen.

14:47.395 --> 14:49.720
And a new tyranny begins.

14:57.600 --> 14:59.605
Tough though they are,

14:59.640 --> 15:03.880
such refugees living on
the edges of North Africa

15:03.915 --> 15:07.280
cannot survive in the
heart of the Sahara.

15:11.840 --> 15:14.565
And yet here, in southern Nigeria,

15:14.600 --> 15:18.240
there are creatures preparing to
journey right across the centre

15:18.275 --> 15:19.880
of that great desert.

15:24.760 --> 15:26.640
Barn swallows.

15:31.840 --> 15:34.725
IT SINGS

15:34.760 --> 15:38.240
They spent the winter roosting
in a forest of elephant grass.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.000
But now, it's time for them to leave.

15:49.080 --> 15:51.760
All two million of them.

16:14.680 --> 16:20.040
They're tiny, each weighing the
same as a couple of one pound coins,

16:20.075 --> 16:23.240
yet the journey to their
breeding grounds in Europe

16:23.275 --> 16:25.160
is over 3,000 miles long.

16:27.960 --> 16:31.080
Ahead of them lies a vast death trap.

16:34.600 --> 16:37.605
The Sahara is too large to go around.

16:37.640 --> 16:42.080
The swallows have no choice
but to meet it head-on.

16:53.800 --> 16:57.120
It will take one of nature's
greatest feats of navigation

16:57.155 --> 16:59.480
to cross this lifeless wasteland.

17:01.920 --> 17:06.040
A wilderness that stretches
not just to the horizon,

17:06.075 --> 17:08.760
but almost beyond imagination.

17:17.760 --> 17:21.480
It's an immense blank
space on the map.

17:28.920 --> 17:31.480
In spite of the Sahara's reputation,

17:31.515 --> 17:34.040
less than one-fifth of it is sand.

17:37.240 --> 17:40.005
The rest is stone

17:40.040 --> 17:41.840
and wind-scoured rock.

17:51.600 --> 17:55.160
The sun not only bakes the land,

17:55.195 --> 17:57.280
it warps its appearance.

18:00.520 --> 18:04.680
The superheated air, rising
upward from the desert surface,

18:04.715 --> 18:06.800
distorts the distant scene.

18:11.040 --> 18:16.000
A reflection of the sky shimmers on the sands
- a mirage.

18:22.360 --> 18:24.960
The sun is an illusionist.

18:28.640 --> 18:30.565
To thirsty travellers,

18:30.600 --> 18:32.285
a mirage can resemble a lake

18:32.320 --> 18:36.160
which agonisingly recedes
as it's approached.

18:44.400 --> 18:47.880
And swaying camels
coming to the rescue

18:47.915 --> 18:51.360
transform into dry,
spiny acacia trees.

19:02.360 --> 19:06.205
To cross this confused,
shimmering landscape,

19:06.240 --> 19:11.080
many swallows will need to find
real water amongst the mirages.

19:17.960 --> 19:21.860
Even in the Sahara,
rain does sometimes fall

19:21.895 --> 19:25.207
and that is sufficient
for plants to survive

19:25.242 --> 19:28.520
providing they have
the right adaptations.

19:29.760 --> 19:31.885
Rising from the sand,

19:31.920 --> 19:34.120
a dried-out ball of twigs.

19:41.760 --> 19:44.160
In strong winds, it can travel.

20:01.920 --> 20:04.720
This plant may have
been dead for 100 years.

20:08.640 --> 20:12.640
Yet its name suggests
that all is not lost,

20:12.675 --> 20:15.160
for this is a resurrection plant.

20:23.320 --> 20:27.120
Around here, rain might only
fall once or twice a year.

20:31.040 --> 20:33.480
But if you're searching for decades,

20:33.515 --> 20:35.240
that might be enough.

20:42.160 --> 20:44.525
Dead limbs absorb water

20:44.560 --> 20:47.320
and unfurl in a matter of minutes.

20:49.920 --> 20:53.600
But the resurrection plant
needs one more miracle.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.560
THUNDER

21:00.760 --> 21:03.925
Rain must fall on its branches

21:03.960 --> 21:06.560
before they dry out
and close up again.

22:04.320 --> 22:07.560
Within hours, shoots emerge.

22:23.720 --> 22:26.300
In just a few weeks, they flower

22:26.335 --> 22:28.880
and develop seeds of their own.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.880
Then, before they
can grow any larger,

22:38.915 --> 22:41.440
the sun kills them.

22:47.080 --> 22:48.765
But their seeds live on,

22:48.800 --> 22:51.320
ready for when the rains return,

22:51.355 --> 22:53.840
even if that is a century from now.

22:58.280 --> 23:01.605
North Africa wasn't always so brutal.

23:01.640 --> 23:04.920
Scattered across the
Sahara are glimpses of life

23:04.955 --> 23:08.120
before the apocalypse
swept over the land.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.200
In the north, a petrified forest -

23:14.235 --> 23:16.005
trees turned to stone.

23:16.040 --> 23:19.480
Remains from a far
distant, wetter past.

23:24.160 --> 23:28.560
White sediments in the heart of
the Sahara are the dried-out remains

23:28.595 --> 23:31.880
of what was once the
world's largest lake.

23:35.560 --> 23:39.320
In the east, ruined cities
hark back to a time of plenty.

23:47.520 --> 23:50.280
And here, deep inside Libya,

23:50.315 --> 23:52.160
is Messak Settafet.

23:56.800 --> 24:02.920
Carved here are hundreds of images
of animals, all drawn from life.

24:07.120 --> 24:09.920
Ghosts from a greener time.

24:15.280 --> 24:20.200
Remarkably, a remnant of this
old North Africa survives.

24:24.400 --> 24:29.800
Bou-Hedma, in Tunisia, is
sustained by mountain rains.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.500
It's a relic of the savannah

24:36.535 --> 24:38.440
that once carpeted North Africa.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.925
The vast grassland vanished

24:52.960 --> 24:57.480
when a shift in the Earth's
orbit drove the rains south

24:57.515 --> 25:00.457
and, in perhaps only
a matter of centuries,

25:00.492 --> 25:03.400
the Sahara Desert
overwhelmed North Africa.

25:08.160 --> 25:12.600
The evidence suggests this took
place around 6,000 years ago.

25:12.635 --> 25:15.645
In evolutionary terms,
that's no time at all

25:15.680 --> 25:19.880
and life has had little chance
to adapt to this new world.

25:26.520 --> 25:31.920
Only a few tough specialists can
cope with life amongst the dunes.

25:40.360 --> 25:41.760
THEY GRUNT

25:47.280 --> 25:49.120
THEY GRUNT

25:50.160 --> 25:54.040
Camels are sometimes
called "ships of the desert"

25:54.075 --> 25:55.165
but, like the swallows,

25:55.200 --> 25:57.760
they're really only visitors here.

25:59.160 --> 26:02.365
These "ships" can
certainly cross the Sahara,

26:02.400 --> 26:06.440
but even THEY can't make their
home in the harshest places.

26:11.560 --> 26:14.080
Left to wander the
desert by themselves,

26:14.115 --> 26:16.885
camels would not survive.

26:16.920 --> 26:21.640
They depend on their human
navigators to find oases and wells.

26:28.480 --> 26:32.165
Saharan folklore is
full of tales of caravans

26:32.200 --> 26:36.400
that missed a well by a few
hundred metres and disappeared.

26:51.240 --> 26:54.920
This is the White Desert, in Egypt.

27:00.120 --> 27:04.560
The landscape is littered
with giant chalk pillars,

27:04.595 --> 27:08.200
carved by innumerable sandstorms.

27:12.400 --> 27:16.200
This glaring white
oven is lethally hot.

27:19.000 --> 27:22.240
Food here is almost non-existent.

27:25.560 --> 27:28.965
But there's a rare gift
from a passing camel.

27:29.000 --> 27:32.720
The smell has lured dung
beetles from miles around.

27:35.040 --> 27:37.920
For them, this is manna from heaven.

27:45.320 --> 27:48.045
One dung ball could
provide enough food

27:48.080 --> 27:51.400
to last this female beetle
the rest of her life.

27:53.440 --> 27:55.040
But she has a problem.

27:56.280 --> 27:57.485
To keep it fresh,

27:57.520 --> 28:00.120
she must bury it in moist ground.

28:00.155 --> 28:02.480
And that's not easy to find.

28:10.960 --> 28:14.600
The temperature has
already risen ten degrees.

28:20.480 --> 28:23.480
This lizard avoids the roasting sand.

28:24.960 --> 28:27.160
Only 30 centimetres
above the surface,

28:27.195 --> 28:29.440
it's significantly cooler.

28:37.440 --> 28:39.900
The 'reverse-pushing' technique

28:39.935 --> 28:41.887
is certainly the fastest way

28:41.922 --> 28:43.840
to keep the ball rolling.

28:49.360 --> 28:51.800
But it does have one drawback.

29:00.760 --> 29:02.680
You can't see where you're going.

29:07.400 --> 29:08.800
Disaster!

29:10.080 --> 29:12.760
Stuck between two dunes.

29:20.960 --> 29:23.645
The dung ball is twice her weight,

29:23.680 --> 29:27.800
but the urge to keep
pushing is inextinguishable.

30:11.440 --> 30:15.060
Now, it's 41 degrees Celsius.

30:15.095 --> 30:18.680
Soon, she'll be baked alive.

30:22.680 --> 30:28.440
Her survival instinct, in the
end, over-rides her love for dung.

30:39.840 --> 30:44.240
Much of the Sahara is uninhabitable,
but there are rare places

30:44.275 --> 30:47.917
where there is some
possibility of survival.

30:47.952 --> 30:51.560
Places where, by strange
chance, there is water.

30:55.600 --> 30:59.080
Waw An Namus is an extinct volcano.

31:00.080 --> 31:05.240
From space, it's a remote,
black scar on the Libyan Sahara.

31:12.240 --> 31:14.965
Yet there are other colours here,

31:15.000 --> 31:18.160
colours rarely seen
on the desert floor.

31:19.880 --> 31:23.480
Blue and green.

31:36.000 --> 31:40.440
Rain fell thousands of years
ago, when the Sahara was green

31:40.475 --> 31:43.240
and percolated deep into the ground.

31:44.400 --> 31:46.965
And here water from this vast,

31:47.000 --> 31:50.200
ancient reservoir
rises to the surface.

31:52.560 --> 31:57.320
These pools offer another
glimpse of the Sahara's past.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.565
Wherever there's
water in North Africa,

32:06.600 --> 32:11.200
living relics from this wetter
time have a chance to cling on.

32:14.400 --> 32:19.440
This oasis is fed by
a hot volcanic spring.

32:24.400 --> 32:28.120
Slightly away from the
stream of near-boiling water,

32:28.155 --> 32:31.080
its cooler, and fish can live.

32:31.115 --> 32:33.680
These are tilapia.

32:36.280 --> 32:39.605
Hatchlings stick
close to their mother.

32:39.640 --> 32:43.360
There are other dangers here
beside the scalding water.

32:47.800 --> 32:51.040
Particularly at night.

33:01.120 --> 33:04.280
The crocodiles are stealthy.

33:12.200 --> 33:17.320
And the tilapia are almost
blind in the darkness.

33:22.760 --> 33:26.600
In panic, they all leap to
escape the hunters' approach.

33:33.480 --> 33:37.360
But this female can't
abandon her brood.

33:44.760 --> 33:48.800
The crocodiles won't be
thwarted. They too can leap.

34:33.120 --> 34:38.040
With first light, the crocodiles
lose the element of surprise,

34:38.074 --> 34:40.520
and the battle is over, for now.

34:42.239 --> 34:47.159
The mother fish has survived,
but where are her young?

34:50.880 --> 34:54.045
All present and correct.

34:54.080 --> 34:58.320
They spent the whole night
sheltering in her mouth.

34:59.600 --> 35:02.560
The contest will be
repeated at sunset.

35:03.600 --> 35:05.880
There is nowhere else to go.

35:11.240 --> 35:14.880
Oases are always sought
by desert travellers,

35:14.915 --> 35:17.320
but not all are as they seem.

35:25.160 --> 35:31.600
This is the great Ubari Sand
Sea, in the heart of the Sahara.

35:35.280 --> 35:39.600
These swallows have
travelled 1,500 miles

35:39.635 --> 35:41.520
since they left Nigeria.

35:43.440 --> 35:47.400
Their superb powers of navigation
will eventually guide them

35:47.435 --> 35:51.697
to Europe, but now they,
and other thirsty migrants,

35:51.732 --> 35:55.960
need to find a speck of blue
amidst this ocean of sand.

36:00.560 --> 36:02.980
And here it is.

36:03.015 --> 36:05.400
Umm el Mar.

36:13.520 --> 36:17.720
Here too, ancient groundwater
wells up to the surface.

36:37.680 --> 36:40.205
But the birds need to be careful,

36:40.240 --> 36:43.600
for the sun has played
a terrible trick.

36:51.040 --> 36:54.440
This oasis is poisonous.

36:56.920 --> 37:01.240
Intense evaporation over thousands
of years has left the water

37:01.275 --> 37:03.400
saltier than the sea.

37:05.960 --> 37:08.005
As if to underline the horror,

37:08.040 --> 37:12.000
the place is infested
by vast swarms of flies.

37:16.440 --> 37:19.760
But this plague is
a birds' salvation.

37:23.960 --> 37:29.080
The flies are filled with
freshwater, filtered from the brine.

37:35.040 --> 37:39.520
So, like a desert wanderer
squeezing a drink from a cactus,

37:39.555 --> 37:44.000
the birds get all the water
they need from the flies' bodies.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.560
More and more migrants join in.

37:56.720 --> 37:59.000
Wagtails.

38:14.200 --> 38:16.680
This is the birds' only stopover.

38:18.320 --> 38:24.480
It gives them enough fuel to
escape from the Sahara and Africa.

38:27.400 --> 38:29.205
Away from an oasis,

38:29.240 --> 38:33.000
it seems remarkable that
anything can live at all.

38:37.600 --> 38:41.560
The temperature of the sands
can exceed 70 degrees Celsius.

38:43.880 --> 38:48.120
There's not the slightest trace
of water left at the surface.

38:53.200 --> 38:58.200
And when that happens, the
Sahara itself cries out.

39:02.760 --> 39:05.440
LOUD HUMMING

39:33.960 --> 39:37.340
Billions of sliding
grains generate a hum

39:37.375 --> 39:40.720
that echoes across
miles of empty desert.

39:42.120 --> 39:46.640
These are the Sahara's
legendary singing dunes.

40:12.120 --> 40:15.680
Over time, these avalanches add up.

40:19.840 --> 40:22.080
If you watch the
dunes for long enough,

40:22.115 --> 40:24.640
something remarkable is revealed.

40:27.280 --> 40:31.480
One and a half years flash
past in a matter of seconds.

40:40.400 --> 40:44.640
On this timescale, the
dunes are like a stormy sea.

40:51.200 --> 40:55.040
An unstoppable tsunami of sand.

41:03.160 --> 41:06.525
In this immense,
ever-shifting landscape,

41:06.560 --> 41:09.765
it's easy to see how a
lost traveller could succumb

41:09.800 --> 41:14.760
to what's been called the
Sahara's only endemic disease -

41:14.795 --> 41:16.520
madness.

41:34.600 --> 41:38.520
Can anything survive
the North African desert

41:38.555 --> 41:41.360
when the sun is at its fiercest?

41:47.080 --> 41:50.405
It's approaching mid-day.

41:50.440 --> 41:53.680
A fringe-toed lizard is hungry.

41:54.760 --> 41:57.080
He's on a stake-out.

42:05.360 --> 42:09.600
Flashy scales reflect
some of the sun's rays.

42:11.240 --> 42:15.080
Nevertheless, the heat
is almost unbearable.

42:19.200 --> 42:22.400
His prey hasn't left home all day.

42:34.760 --> 42:39.480
The lizard is the last
animal still out on the dunes.

42:43.480 --> 42:46.600
But even he can't take it any more.

42:48.040 --> 42:51.680
To survive longer, you
would need a spacesuit.

42:55.120 --> 42:59.040
And in a way, that's
what these insects have.

43:02.200 --> 43:06.245
Silver ants' armoured
skin reflects light.

43:06.280 --> 43:11.040
They can tolerate temperatures that
would kill any other land animal.

43:12.720 --> 43:16.800
Even so, they can only survive
for less than ten minutes

43:16.835 --> 43:18.480
in the midday sun.

43:27.600 --> 43:30.125
Time is precious.

43:30.160 --> 43:34.880
The ants race to find food as soon
as their predators go to ground.

43:43.920 --> 43:47.040
They can't afford to waste
a second getting lost,

43:47.075 --> 43:50.320
so they spin to take
a bearing from the sun.

43:51.440 --> 43:55.085
They log every change of
direction, every footstep,

43:55.120 --> 43:58.880
in order to know exactly where
they are and where their nest lies.

44:05.040 --> 44:06.925
Only four minutes to spare,

44:06.960 --> 44:11.520
and they've found a victim
of heatstroke. A meal.

44:15.080 --> 44:18.800
But it's going to take a
monumental effort to get it home.

44:33.040 --> 44:36.920
Three minutes to go and they're
nearing their maximum temperature,

44:36.955 --> 44:39.720
an astounding 53 degrees Celsius.

44:48.640 --> 44:51.400
But there are already casualties.

45:01.840 --> 45:04.920
One minute left, and
they're not going to make it.

45:04.955 --> 45:06.920
Something has to change.

45:53.920 --> 45:58.580
The silver ant is the hardiest
of all desert inhabitants.

45:58.615 --> 46:03.240
Even so, it can only survive
outside in the middle of the day

46:03.275 --> 46:04.640
for a matter of minutes.

46:09.880 --> 46:14.520
Now, the desert belongs
to the sun alone.

46:17.360 --> 46:21.685
The sun has scorched
life from the Sahara.

46:21.720 --> 46:26.200
And yet the vast desert it
created is a source of life

46:26.235 --> 46:28.280
half a world away.

46:32.360 --> 46:38.005
The advancing Sahara vaporised
the world's largest lake,

46:38.040 --> 46:43.880
leaving behind the silvery remains
of countless microscopic algae.

46:46.600 --> 46:51.600
In winter, the wind
carries away 700,000 tonnes

46:51.635 --> 46:54.760
of this mineral-rich dust every day.

46:57.320 --> 47:01.165
It blows from here all
the way to South America,

47:01.200 --> 47:06.400
where, astonishingly, it
fertilises the Amazon rainforest.

47:12.160 --> 47:18.120
A striking demonstration of the
reach of this mighty continent.

47:28.040 --> 47:32.980
Throughout its long history, Africa
has influenced the entire planet.

47:33.015 --> 47:37.885
It was the cradle of a remarkable
array of land animals that spread

47:37.920 --> 47:42.960
across the globe, and, of course, it
was the ancestral home of all of us.

48:13.560 --> 48:17.280
This is the tale of
two of the Africa team's

48:17.315 --> 48:19.920
most challenging desert expeditions.

48:24.480 --> 48:29.240
One focused on a miniscule creature
with an incredible turn of speed.

48:32.160 --> 48:36.520
The other, on a subject so slow, to
film it in action would take years.

48:38.480 --> 48:41.440
In both cases, the
Sahara would push crews

48:41.475 --> 48:44.400
to the limit in pursuit
of the perfect shot.

48:49.000 --> 48:52.805
In Tunisia, the mission is
to capture footage of moving

48:52.840 --> 48:57.040
sand dunes, something that's
never been tried like this before.

48:57.075 --> 49:01.240
Because the dunes move so slowly,
we'll have to leave cameras here

49:01.275 --> 49:02.245
for about 20 months,

49:02.280 --> 49:04.960
which means there's a huge
potential for things to go wrong.

49:06.200 --> 49:10.520
And with film-making, if something
can go wrong, it usually will.

49:12.000 --> 49:15.005
Two local shepherds, Amur and Nasser,

49:15.040 --> 49:18.000
have volunteered to tend
the equipment full-time.

49:20.720 --> 49:23.920
The camera tower will
be the tallest structure

49:23.955 --> 49:26.040
for as far as the eye can see.

49:29.640 --> 49:33.160
And there are three other
cameras at lower angles.

49:34.960 --> 49:39.925
All this toil will yield
surprisingly scant results.

49:39.960 --> 49:44.080
They've programmed the cameras
to take one photo every day.

49:44.115 --> 49:47.845
That's only 365 photographs a year...

49:47.880 --> 49:52.120
which, when you run it at normal
speed, just over 14 seconds.

49:52.155 --> 49:56.360
I think it's taken longer to
explain what's going to happen

49:56.395 --> 49:58.885
than the end result will actually be.

49:58.920 --> 50:02.800
The cameras are left to the
mercy of the sun, wind and sand.

50:04.680 --> 50:09.040
In the meantime, crews are
shooting all across North Africa.

50:11.880 --> 50:15.720
In Egypt, the challenge is to
get into the world of the most

50:15.755 --> 50:19.077
heat-tolerant desert
animal, the silver ant.

50:19.112 --> 50:22.365
They're really small,
they're really fast.

50:22.400 --> 50:25.080
Like, you're not too sure
if you've seen an ant.

50:26.920 --> 50:30.960
The crew have three weeks to
gather the footage they need.

50:32.280 --> 50:35.120
We're going to try a tracking
shot on this ant nest.

50:35.155 --> 50:38.405
Moving forward towards it,

50:38.440 --> 50:41.840
as the ants pour out of
the hole in their millions.

50:41.875 --> 50:44.840
Not only are these
insects super-fast,

50:44.875 --> 50:47.440
they also keep antisocial hours.

50:47.475 --> 50:48.805
The thing is,

50:48.840 --> 50:52.480
we need to be out here in the
middle of the day to film these ants.

50:52.515 --> 50:55.840
They don't do what they do when
it's nice and cool at seven,

50:55.875 --> 50:57.965
eight o'clock in the morning.

50:58.000 --> 51:01.160
I can't remember ever being
in a place where the wind was

51:01.195 --> 51:03.960
so relentless and the
temperatures were so high.

51:07.000 --> 51:10.640
The insufferable heat
is not the only problem.

51:10.675 --> 51:12.680
Dangers are everywhere.

51:12.715 --> 51:15.085
Ooh!

51:15.120 --> 51:18.520
There's a really fat
scorpion, it's really big!

51:18.555 --> 51:20.040
One, two, three.

51:24.040 --> 51:25.700
This might kill.

51:25.735 --> 51:27.325
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

51:27.360 --> 51:31.720
It's big and they have a lot
of poison in his dark thing.

51:31.755 --> 51:33.880
What, that thing there?

51:33.915 --> 51:35.317
Don't! Oh, my god!

51:35.352 --> 51:36.685
Don't touch it!

51:36.720 --> 51:40.600
The scorpion will be released
far, far away from the camp,

51:40.635 --> 51:43.285
in a shady spot.

51:43.320 --> 51:45.325
No such luck for the team.

51:45.360 --> 51:49.400
They're back to work
in the midday sun.

51:49.435 --> 51:53.440
This is, this is too
much. This is crazy.

51:53.475 --> 51:54.880
This is crazy.

51:54.915 --> 51:55.925
Indeed.

51:55.960 --> 52:00.000
The heat seems to have given Kat and
Warwick a touch of Saharan madness.

52:01.680 --> 52:03.925
The plan is to do an experiment,

52:03.960 --> 52:08.565
to find out how fast
these little ants can run.

52:08.600 --> 52:13.480
So we're going to lay this along
the floor, and hopefully an ant will

52:13.515 --> 52:16.797
run alongside it and we
can film it at high speed.

52:16.832 --> 52:20.045
And from that, calculate
their... their speed,

52:20.080 --> 52:24.400
and perhaps try and relate it to
how fast that would be for a human.

52:24.435 --> 52:26.605
Like me.

52:26.640 --> 52:29.045
Silver ants are expert navigators,

52:29.080 --> 52:32.565
using the angle of the sun
to calculate their position.

52:32.600 --> 52:37.720
But for our team, even basic mental
tasks are becoming a challenge.

52:37.755 --> 52:41.117
Count the seconds. See one
running and then count the seconds.

52:41.152 --> 52:44.480
- It's difficult to count a second, isn't it?
- No, it's "one".

52:46.360 --> 52:48.680
"One", yeah!

52:53.160 --> 52:54.680
There he goes!

52:56.760 --> 52:59.780
He's gone ten centimetres
in four seconds,

52:59.815 --> 53:02.800
but we're running at
500 frames a second,

53:02.835 --> 53:04.565
which is 20 times normal time.

53:04.600 --> 53:08.880
- Yeah.
- So in fact, he's covered those ten centimetres in...

53:12.760 --> 53:16.000
We know that he does half
a metre in one second.

53:16.035 --> 53:18.405
Half a metre per second, yep.

53:18.440 --> 53:22.240
- 50 centimetres in one second, roughly.
- Yeah.

53:22.275 --> 53:25.040
So, how many body lengths is that?

53:26.920 --> 53:29.440
He's maybe doing five
body lengths a second,

53:29.475 --> 53:31.005
if he's two metres tall like I am.

53:31.040 --> 53:34.400
- Are you?
- Yeah. That's how much more than a normal man I am.

53:40.200 --> 53:45.320
Eventually, the duo decide that
if the silver ants were our size,

53:45.355 --> 53:49.160
they'd be doing 280 miles an hour.

53:52.000 --> 53:55.600
They're one of the fastest
sprinters in the animal kingdom.

53:55.635 --> 53:58.280
No wonder we've been
struggling to film them.

53:58.315 --> 53:59.920
It does explain a few things.

54:01.800 --> 54:03.960
Ant-letics!

54:07.480 --> 54:11.120
Knowing the exact speed of the ants
is all well and good, but there's

54:11.155 --> 54:14.680
still a great deal of work to be
done before the shoot finishes.

54:16.440 --> 54:21.060
However, in Tunisia, there's no
shortage of time, and hopefully,

54:21.095 --> 54:25.680
no news is good news, as far as
Amur and Nasser are concerned.

54:30.240 --> 54:32.765
The final week in Egypt,

54:32.800 --> 54:36.200
and the crew seem to be
adapting to life in the oven.

54:39.520 --> 54:43.680
Practice is making perfect, and
the sequence is coming together.

54:46.880 --> 54:49.085
I think we've got some lovely shots.

54:49.120 --> 54:51.565
Every single shot has
been really hard-earned.

54:51.600 --> 54:55.880
But getting down in the ant's world
is now taking its toll on the kit.

54:55.915 --> 54:57.525
It's running to stand still,

54:57.560 --> 55:00.240
the business of blowing
dust off these things.

55:01.840 --> 55:03.445
Oh, no!

55:03.480 --> 55:05.320
It's got dust in it!

55:05.355 --> 55:06.485
CRUNCH

55:06.520 --> 55:08.080
Ooh, crunch.

55:10.640 --> 55:12.725
I think these ants
are stunning looking.

55:12.760 --> 55:16.140
Near-impossible to film, I think,
because of the speed they had.

55:16.175 --> 55:19.520
But, you know, I've come to love
them over the days and weeks.

55:21.480 --> 55:23.165
With the sequence in the bag,

55:23.200 --> 55:26.800
Warwick wants the final
traditional sunset shot.

55:27.800 --> 55:31.200
It's the best time of day to
film sunsets, in the evening.

55:32.800 --> 55:34.845
That's experience that tells me that.

55:34.880 --> 55:37.685
I've been doing this for
years. You learn these things.

55:37.720 --> 55:42.500
Thanks to Warwick's experience,
including sunsets, he and Kat

55:42.535 --> 55:47.280
have captured the extraordinary
life of the speedy silver ant.

55:50.280 --> 55:52.805
Over a year later, in Tunisia,

55:52.840 --> 55:56.440
it's time to take down
the sand dune cameras.

55:57.480 --> 55:59.565
Bonjour!

55:59.600 --> 56:03.845
Nasser, Amur. Hello again.

56:03.880 --> 56:05.685
So how's it been, has it been good?

56:05.720 --> 56:10.960
It's OK, but two days ago, we
have a little bit...small problem.

56:10.995 --> 56:13.725
After surviving 600
days in the desert,

56:13.760 --> 56:17.880
the "small problem" is that the
cameras have been vandalised.

56:20.720 --> 56:23.360
I'm really hot and bothered
now, it's 40 degrees,

56:23.395 --> 56:27.245
and someone's smashed the cameras.

56:27.280 --> 56:30.000
Not been a good start
to the day, to be honest.

56:31.040 --> 56:33.525
There's no doubt
the dunes have moved.

56:33.560 --> 56:37.240
But the question is whether
the equipment has survived.

56:40.400 --> 56:42.565
That is amazing, the
camera's still here.

56:42.600 --> 56:46.165
I guess maybe it just took them so long
to get through the toughened plastic,

56:46.200 --> 56:49.920
that they felt they had made so much noise
they were worried about the guards coming,

56:49.955 --> 56:52.605
because they only sleep a
couple of 100 metres away.

56:52.640 --> 56:57.680
After almost two years of
waiting, it's the moment of truth.

57:00.000 --> 57:03.100
We're going to find out,
find out whether or not

57:03.135 --> 57:06.165
the cameras have actually
recorded anything.

57:06.200 --> 57:09.920
It's just hugely stressful because
it's never been done before.

57:12.360 --> 57:16.000
The footage is a surreal
window into a secret world -

57:16.035 --> 57:18.760
the private life of a sand dune.

57:28.560 --> 57:31.920
The Africa team struggled
under the burning sun

57:31.955 --> 57:35.280
and driving winds that are
hallmarks of the Sahara.

57:40.960 --> 57:45.085
They went home with an enormous
admiration for the creatures that

57:45.120 --> 57:50.520
spend their entire lives battling to
survive in this brutal desert world.

57:58.440 --> 58:02.040
Next time, we'll be looking
towards the future of Africa

58:02.075 --> 58:03.805
and its wildlife.

58:03.840 --> 58:09.880
Meeting the remarkable Elvis
and his highly endangered family.

58:09.915 --> 58:13.080
Diving with Shella, who's
learning to swim again.

58:14.360 --> 58:17.840
Africa's wildlife is
at a critical point

58:17.875 --> 58:20.200
as it faces its greatest threat.

58:21.480 --> 58:23.245
As this battle between man

58:23.280 --> 58:27.360
and wildlife happens, in most
cases, wildlife is on the losing end.

58:31.320 --> 58:35.005
But there is hope as the new
generation takes on the task

58:35.040 --> 58:39.960
of protecting Africa's animals
for the 21st century and beyond.

58:39.995 --> 58:44.080
Join me next time for
the future of Africa.
