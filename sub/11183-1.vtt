00:23.190 --> 00:24.828
We are being radar scanned.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.701
Bring a Bullpup on the line.

00:29.263 --> 00:32.506
Gabrielle, don't get interested
in Stringfellow Hawke.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.876
There's no future in it for you or any woman.

00:34.935 --> 00:36.278
You've got to get to Libya.

00:36.336 --> 00:39.408
That's Khadafy's sand pile.
He doesn't like us, String.

00:40.908 --> 00:44.378
In the desert, a body like
this would wither and die.

00:44.645 --> 00:47.819
After a few hours with such a
body, what would it matter?

00:48.949 --> 00:50.929
We've got 48 hours to recover Airwolf

00:50.984 --> 00:52.895
or they're sending in the Marines.

00:52.953 --> 00:54.023
Chain guns 1 and 2.

00:54.087 --> 00:55.157
Set.

03:47.861 --> 03:49.738
Turbos 1 and 2.

03:49.796 --> 03:50.831
In the green.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.205
Main rotor torque.

03:52.265 --> 03:53.869
In the green.

04:02.175 --> 04:03.654
I don't believe you people.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.621
You haul my butt out of bed at midnight.

04:05.679 --> 04:09.024
You fly me off to only God knows
where to see some lousy helicopter,

04:09.082 --> 04:10.959
and there's not even any cream cheese.

04:11.017 --> 04:13.554
It's not a lousy helicopter, Senator.

04:13.620 --> 04:14.997
It's Airwolf.

04:15.055 --> 04:17.365
Well, whatever esoteric name you hang on it,

04:17.423 --> 04:19.927
it's still an overgrown
beanie with a propeller,

04:19.993 --> 04:22.439
eating its way through somebody's budget.

04:22.496 --> 04:24.999
I hate bagels without cream cheese.

04:28.001 --> 04:30.572
It's a mean-looking bird, I'll give you that.

04:30.637 --> 04:32.139
Who designed it?

04:32.205 --> 04:34.207
The pilot. Dr. Moffett.

04:34.574 --> 04:35.882
Moffett?

04:36.176 --> 04:38.247
Moffett. I know that name.

04:38.979 --> 04:40.652
Your cream cheese, Senator.

04:40.714 --> 04:42.694
The damn stuff is pink.

04:43.383 --> 04:45.454
It's, salmon-flavored.

04:46.553 --> 04:48.430
Only in California.

04:48.488 --> 04:50.468
Red Star Control. Airwolf

04:50.524 --> 04:52.128
all systems are go.

04:52.192 --> 04:53.671
Airwolf, Red Star Control.

04:53.727 --> 04:55.331
You may clear the defense area.

05:07.240 --> 05:08.480
How fast is that bird?

05:08.542 --> 05:10.419
We don't know yet. So far,

05:10.477 --> 05:13.356
it's only slightly exceeded
the speed of sound.

05:13.413 --> 05:16.519
No helicopter can fly faster than sound.

05:16.783 --> 05:18.319
Airwolf can.

05:18.418 --> 05:21.729
Basically, Airwolf is an
aerodynamic lifting body

05:21.788 --> 05:23.790
with a twin turbine-driven rotor system

05:23.857 --> 05:25.803
capable of propelling it to 300 knots.

05:25.859 --> 05:26.929
In other words,

05:26.993 --> 05:29.132
it's a fast, twin-engine jet chopper.

05:29.196 --> 05:31.073
One can express it in those terms

05:31.131 --> 05:34.271
except this jet chopper
can disengage its rotor system

05:34.334 --> 05:36.473
and ignite these 2 additional turbines.

05:36.536 --> 05:38.413
9.6 seconds after ignition,

05:38.471 --> 05:42.180
Airwolf can exceed Mach 1 from
sea level to 65,000 feet.

05:42.909 --> 05:44.149
The crew consists of

05:44.211 --> 05:45.519
an in-flight systems specialist

05:45.579 --> 05:47.320
in the electronic data command center

05:47.380 --> 05:49.121
to monitor turbine temperatures,

05:49.182 --> 05:51.560
fuel and lubricant pressure,
rotor synchronization,

05:51.618 --> 05:52.995
all on board flight systems.

05:53.053 --> 05:54.191
The 2nd crewman

05:54.254 --> 05:55.562
is a counter-measure specialist.

05:55.622 --> 05:56.657
His primary M.O.S.,

05:56.723 --> 05:58.327
is to suppress, neutralize, or destroy

05:58.391 --> 06:00.428
any weapons threatening
the integrity of Airwolf.

06:01.595 --> 06:03.802
He also has a duplicate flight system control

06:03.864 --> 06:06.708
in case the Aircraft Commander
becomes incapacitated.

06:06.766 --> 06:08.746
And finally, the Aircraft Commander,

06:08.802 --> 06:10.804
who's responsible for positive flight control,

06:10.871 --> 06:13.317
target acquisition, and
weapon system selection.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.785
The latter offers him 14 firepower options

06:15.842 --> 06:19.790
ranging from 30mm cannons to
nuclear-tip Shrike missiles.

06:21.448 --> 06:22.825
In other words, Senator,

06:22.883 --> 06:25.056
Airwolf is a Mach 1-plus chopper

06:25.118 --> 06:26.927
that can kick butt.

06:32.859 --> 06:35.965
If Airwolf can "kick butt"
like she says it can,

06:36.096 --> 06:38.975
you've developed yourself a tactical weapon.

06:39.032 --> 06:40.978
But that's not the Firm's mission.

06:41.034 --> 06:42.138
No, sir, it's not.

06:42.202 --> 06:44.079
But when the project started 20 years ago

06:44.137 --> 06:45.309
after the Bay of Pigs,

06:45.372 --> 06:47.409
the Firm's priorities were a little different.

06:47.474 --> 06:48.578
Then as the years went by…

06:48.642 --> 06:49.712
The project grew.

06:49.776 --> 06:52.052
Now you've got topsy, what
are you gonna do with her?

06:52.112 --> 06:55.423
You can only keep the lid on testing
and development for so long.

06:55.482 --> 06:57.462
And if the Firm puts Airwolf in the field,

06:57.517 --> 06:59.394
it'll leak to Congress in a week.

06:59.452 --> 07:01.056
And they won't take kindly

07:01.121 --> 07:03.601
to the Firm's developing
secret tactical weapons.

07:03.657 --> 07:05.261
That's why the Firm would like to

07:05.325 --> 07:07.828
turn this prototype over to
the Department of Defense

07:07.894 --> 07:09.965
and let them take credit for it.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.236
In exchange for what?

07:11.298 --> 07:13.141
Reimbursement of development costs

07:13.199 --> 07:16.078
and the first 5 Airwolfs
off the production line.

07:16.136 --> 07:18.116
Talk to me in dollars and cents.

07:18.171 --> 07:20.082
$1 billion, Senator.

07:20.473 --> 07:22.111
Give or take a few cents.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.586
Red Star to ground leader, stand down.

07:28.648 --> 07:31.322
To demonstrate Airwolf's tactical capabilities

07:31.384 --> 07:34.058
it will penetrate a
typical Soviet defense zone,

07:34.120 --> 07:36.361
the type used around their ICBM sites,

07:36.423 --> 07:38.027
their military command posts

07:38.091 --> 07:39.968
and communication installations.

07:40.026 --> 07:41.369
Simulation has a way of

07:41.428 --> 07:43.430
always making the test vehicle look good.

07:43.496 --> 07:44.702
That defense zone

07:44.764 --> 07:46.402
is filled with Soviet equipment

07:46.466 --> 07:48.912
and manned by personnel
who know how to use it.

07:48.969 --> 07:51.210
This isn't a simulation, Senator.

07:51.271 --> 07:54.047
Those guns out there are loaded.

07:55.041 --> 07:58.284
Airwolf. Red Star Control. You have a go.

08:05.652 --> 08:06.722
He's gone.

08:06.786 --> 08:08.026
Dropped below the radar.

08:08.088 --> 08:10.728
He'll use the mountain range
to block our defense radar

08:10.790 --> 08:12.326
until he can exceed Mach 1.

08:12.392 --> 08:13.462
After that,

08:13.526 --> 08:16.700
he can penetrate the defense zone
from any point on the compass.

08:30.276 --> 08:31.346
Holy...

08:35.215 --> 08:36.888
We have a visual sighting.

08:36.950 --> 08:38.623
Grid Whiskey Lima 5.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.460
Penetration track indicated.

08:40.520 --> 08:42.022
Speed, Mach 1 plus.

08:42.087 --> 08:43.431
No shots fired.

08:43.490 --> 08:44.525
I'll be damned!

08:44.591 --> 08:47.299
He busted right through the Russkie's
front door without a scratch.

08:47.360 --> 08:48.430
Not quite.

08:48.495 --> 08:51.533
The computers have Airwolf's point of
penetration into the defense zone.

08:51.598 --> 08:54.204
They can interpolate his most
likely approach to the target area

08:54.267 --> 08:56.338
and deploy TU-36 helicopters
to block the canyons.

08:56.403 --> 08:58.440
He'll have to climb out of the canyon.

08:58.505 --> 08:59.950
That would put him on S.A.M. radar.

09:00.006 --> 09:01.076
He has no choice.

09:15.055 --> 09:17.296
I have a heat-seeker on our 6.

09:17.357 --> 09:19.667
I.F. suppressor on.

09:23.596 --> 09:26.167
Still closing. Popping a sunburst.

09:36.342 --> 09:38.219
He got past ‘em. He's not on radar.

09:38.278 --> 09:39.382
He's done it.

09:39.446 --> 09:40.550
It's not over yet.

09:40.613 --> 09:41.956
Unless your Dr. Moffett's a fool,

09:42.015 --> 09:43.824
all he has to do is stay in those canyons

09:43.883 --> 09:45.328
until he reaches the target.

09:45.385 --> 09:48.264
A passive defense mechanism
might force him up.

09:48.321 --> 09:49.425
What the hell is that?

09:49.489 --> 09:51.025
Wires!

09:54.094 --> 09:57.098
We have radar contact.
Stand by to launch missiles.

09:57.163 --> 09:58.574
Damn it.

10:01.367 --> 10:03.040
We're being radar-scanned.

10:03.103 --> 10:04.776
Jamming.

10:04.838 --> 10:06.078
Launching missiles.

10:16.749 --> 10:19.025
I have 4 incoming radar-controlled missiles.

10:19.085 --> 10:20.462
3 are off target.

10:20.520 --> 10:23.023
1 is on our track at 10 miles and closing.

10:23.089 --> 10:24.898
Missile impact, 12 seconds.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.461
Hold heading and deploy the ADF pod.

10:27.527 --> 10:30.030
ADF pod undeployable above 300 knots.

10:30.096 --> 10:33.270
Reverse thruster engines.
Stand by to reengage rotors.

10:33.333 --> 10:36.246
Thrusters reversed. Speed, 700 knots.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.181
Missile impact in 7 seconds.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.686
Rotor reengaging. Speed, 400 knots.

10:41.741 --> 10:43.516
Missile impact in 5 seconds.

10:43.576 --> 10:44.714
375… 350… 325…

10:44.777 --> 10:45.847
4 seconds.

10:45.912 --> 10:46.982
325.

10:47.046 --> 10:48.684
3 seconds, 2 seconds…

10:48.748 --> 10:50.455
Pod deploying.

10:54.320 --> 10:56.630
My God, they've blown him away.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.132
Not quite, Senator.

11:10.270 --> 11:12.716
Dr. Moffett, this is Senator Dietz.

11:12.772 --> 11:14.080
I want to congratulate you

11:14.140 --> 11:17.417
on the most spectacular
weapons demo I’ve ever seen.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.650
I'd like to shake your hand.

11:19.712 --> 11:23.091
You already have Senator, on Project Proteus.

11:24.150 --> 11:25.458
Proteus?

11:27.554 --> 11:30.160
That was at White Sands in the '70s.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.567
I trust the Senator remembers me.

11:33.793 --> 11:36.273
Well, it was a… it was a long time ago.

11:36.796 --> 11:40.243
Yes. The Firm has shown
great confidence in my ability

11:40.300 --> 11:42.041
to… to change.

11:43.603 --> 11:46.106
I'm sure that trust is well-founded.

11:46.606 --> 11:48.051
Not really.

15:01.200 --> 15:02.270
It's perfect.

15:02.335 --> 15:04.679
Nothing is perfect.

15:04.871 --> 15:06.441
Not even this.

15:06.572 --> 15:09.075
Well, I don't know what
can be wrong with this.

15:09.142 --> 15:10.587
We're here.

15:46.045 --> 15:47.922
Stringfellow Hawke.

15:47.980 --> 15:49.425
Gabrielle.

15:49.682 --> 15:50.922
Hello.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.323
Where's Marella?

15:53.586 --> 15:56.157
Oh… sick leave.

15:57.290 --> 15:58.530
Sorry.

16:01.527 --> 16:03.404
This is a nice wine.

16:04.163 --> 16:06.734
It's a Montrachet, isn't it? '79.

16:09.635 --> 16:11.615
It's been a long time.

16:13.573 --> 16:14.950
2 years.

16:16.242 --> 16:18.119
I have a job for you.

16:20.246 --> 16:21.418
'78.

16:22.582 --> 16:24.823
Oh, I didn't know that '78 was still…

16:24.884 --> 16:26.795
I already have a job.

16:27.587 --> 16:29.658
This one pays $1 million.

16:29.956 --> 16:32.459
Half now, half on delivery.

16:32.525 --> 16:33.868
Of what?

16:33.926 --> 16:35.200
Airwolf.

16:35.461 --> 16:37.805
Moffett stole it 5 weeks ago.

16:38.931 --> 16:40.376
You blew it.

16:43.503 --> 16:46.313
Hindsight is a wonderful gift, Mr. Hawke.

16:49.809 --> 16:51.720
You scared the eagle.

16:55.314 --> 16:56.588
I what?

16:57.750 --> 17:00.321
Flying in, you down-drafted an eagle.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.097
I'm sorry.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.340
Tell that to the eagle.

17:13.566 --> 17:16.877
I wasn't expecting company.
I'll get another trout.

17:29.148 --> 17:31.094
God, he's infuriating.

17:31.717 --> 17:33.822
Only because he likes you.

17:53.272 --> 17:55.946
Moffett probably flew it
south through Central America

17:56.008 --> 17:57.885
then jumped from Brazil across the Atlantic

17:57.944 --> 17:59.014
to North Africa.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.854
Same route we used to
ferry planes in World War II.

18:01.914 --> 18:03.120
It took 2 weeks

18:03.182 --> 18:04.957
of concentrated satellite surveillance

18:05.017 --> 18:07.327
to confirm Airwolf's location.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.430
It's in Libya.

18:09.488 --> 18:11.729
Khadafy's got it.

18:14.226 --> 18:16.968
Great. That means so do the Russians.

18:17.029 --> 18:18.099
Not yet.

18:18.164 --> 18:20.770
So far, he hasn't even
let them take a look at it.

18:20.833 --> 18:22.835
Khadafy's keeping it for himself.

18:22.902 --> 18:25.143
Why don't you just blow it up
instead of stealing it?

18:25.204 --> 18:29.152
Can't. Moffett's erased the Airwolf
program from the Firm's computers.

18:29.208 --> 18:31.620
And it's gonna take a new development team,

18:31.677 --> 18:33.418
even working with the old subcontractors,

18:33.479 --> 18:36.119
an estimated 5.3 years

18:36.182 --> 18:38.890
to build a new prototype.

18:39.619 --> 18:42.190
This reproduction, it's really excellent.

18:42.254 --> 18:46.202
I saw the original in Paris at
the… at the Impressionist Museum.

18:46.258 --> 18:47.703
No, you didn't.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.467
What's the Firm's position
on Moffett and the crew?

18:50.529 --> 18:52.270
If you can, bring him out with you.

18:52.331 --> 18:54.504
The other 2 aren't important.

18:54.567 --> 18:56.103
And if I can't?

18:56.168 --> 18:58.648
Use extreme prejudice.

19:00.773 --> 19:05.119
I saw the original in Paris 1 month ago.

19:06.479 --> 19:08.186
No, you saw a copy.

19:08.247 --> 19:11.353
Are you trying to tell
me this is the original?

19:11.817 --> 19:13.558
So how do I go in?

19:15.621 --> 19:18.158
As a petroleum engineer from Mirabelle Oil.

19:18.224 --> 19:19.532
It's a French firm,

19:19.592 --> 19:21.435
but most of the technicians are Americans.

19:21.494 --> 19:23.030
Once you land in Tripoli,

19:23.095 --> 19:24.574
our operative there will help you.

19:24.630 --> 19:26.041
The carrier Enterprise

19:26.098 --> 19:27.941
will be standing by in the Gulf of Sirte.

19:28.000 --> 19:30.173
You probably won't have to fly

19:30.236 --> 19:32.273
more than 200 miles to get there.

19:32.872 --> 19:35.876
Yeah, through Khadafy's
army, navy, and air force.

19:35.941 --> 19:37.614
At least it's not the Russians.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.849
It's their equipment.

19:38.911 --> 19:40.948
But the Russians aren't manning it.

19:41.013 --> 19:42.151
You don't know that.

19:42.214 --> 19:44.023
We have people in there, Hawke,

19:44.083 --> 19:47.121
and they've reported the equipment
is being manned by the Libyans.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.792
Besides, you're being paid $1 million.

19:49.855 --> 19:51.801
Hell, how much did Moffett get?

19:51.857 --> 19:53.700
Probably $5 million.

19:55.895 --> 19:57.738
And I get $1 million?

19:58.564 --> 20:01.909
One usually has to pay
traitors more than patriots.

20:04.036 --> 20:06.482
Moffett didn't do it for the money.

20:08.240 --> 20:09.913
Neither will I.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.422
I want Sin Jin.

20:20.586 --> 20:22.395
You're not serious?

20:26.325 --> 20:27.861
God, you are.

20:29.261 --> 20:32.572
Hawke, he's been an MIA for 14 years.

20:32.998 --> 20:36.207
The odds your brother's alive are 10,000-to-1.

20:39.572 --> 20:41.449
Well, if he is dead

20:44.176 --> 20:46.417
at least bring his body back.

20:50.549 --> 20:52.995
I got a job flying in the morning.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.026
You'll find blankets in the window boxes.

20:58.090 --> 21:00.866
It gets kinda cold around dawn.

21:03.195 --> 21:04.606
Good night.

21:15.307 --> 21:17.753
I don't think he'll pull this off.

21:20.246 --> 21:23.125
He can. The question is, can we?

22:41.260 --> 22:43.297
Stringfellow.

22:45.898 --> 22:48.344
You startled me. I couldn't sleep.

22:52.271 --> 22:53.978
I was looking at your collection.

22:54.039 --> 22:55.712
It's incredible.

22:57.509 --> 23:00.490
I thought I heard you moving around up here

23:00.579 --> 23:02.923
and just wanted to talk.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.859
Just about the art.

23:06.919 --> 23:10.526
How anyone could have put
together a collection like that.

23:10.723 --> 23:12.361
It's fantastic.

23:17.229 --> 23:18.299
I'm sorry.

23:18.364 --> 23:20.810
I guess it's none of my business.

23:24.303 --> 23:27.147
You didn't come up here to talk about art.

23:28.307 --> 23:29.752
Yes, I did.

23:33.712 --> 23:34.952
Don't.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.360
This is what you came here for.

23:40.719 --> 23:42.027
No. No.

23:46.025 --> 23:49.165
Archangel's worried I
won't take the assignment.

23:50.829 --> 23:53.173
You're here to sweeten the deal.

23:55.100 --> 23:56.272
You're wrong.

23:56.335 --> 23:58.144
Well, you're a liar.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.013
You didn't come here to talk about art.

24:01.073 --> 24:02.552
Yes, I did.

24:05.277 --> 24:06.654
Maybe not totally,

24:06.712 --> 24:09.318
but I didn't come here for Archangel.

24:13.953 --> 24:15.626
A liar's a liar.

24:17.656 --> 24:19.567
And a whore's a whore.

24:24.763 --> 24:26.140
Damn you.

24:39.144 --> 24:40.817
You're too late.

24:43.382 --> 24:45.089
God already has.

24:52.558 --> 24:54.299
Gabrielle.

24:56.628 --> 24:59.006
My Grandfather collected the art

25:05.971 --> 25:07.780
for my Grandmother.

25:25.357 --> 25:27.303
The money is unimportant to him.

25:28.494 --> 25:30.531
That's right.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.504
Good morning.

25:32.564 --> 25:36.410
No. He won't accept that.
He'll demand hard data.

25:38.270 --> 25:40.750
We'll have to inform the President.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.615
Eggs?

25:45.444 --> 25:47.446
Oh, no. Coffee, please.

25:50.949 --> 25:52.553
Absolutely not.

25:58.057 --> 25:59.559
Is he up yet?

26:00.259 --> 26:02.398
Left a couple of hours ago.

26:02.461 --> 26:04.463
If the committee has a better idea,

26:04.530 --> 26:05.565
I'm listening.

26:05.631 --> 26:08.009
I'll be on blue channel till 08:00.

26:10.669 --> 26:12.444
The committee is going to blow this one.

26:12.504 --> 26:14.108
I can feel it.

26:16.241 --> 26:18.847
I don't think Hawke's going to do it.

26:19.645 --> 26:21.716
What makes you say that?

26:23.048 --> 26:26.427
I talked to him last night
after you went to sleep.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.132
Come on. It's too early in the morning

26:32.191 --> 26:34.728
for incriminating looks from the boss.

26:34.793 --> 26:36.272
Gabrielle,

26:36.929 --> 26:39.910
don't get interested in Stringfellow Hawke.

26:40.466 --> 26:43.470
There's no future in it for you or any woman.

26:44.703 --> 26:45.977
Why not?

26:48.540 --> 26:49.610
When he was 12,

26:49.675 --> 26:52.519
he and his parents were in a
boating accident on the lake.

26:52.578 --> 26:54.080
They drowned.

26:54.146 --> 26:56.126
Just before he shipped out to Vietnam,

26:56.181 --> 26:58.491
he and his girlfriend were in a car crash.

26:58.550 --> 26:59.756
She died.

26:59.818 --> 27:00.922
In Nam,

27:00.986 --> 27:03.296
he and his brother went
down in the same mission.

27:03.355 --> 27:05.961
He got picked up. Sin Jin didn't.

27:07.126 --> 27:09.163
Stringfellow is afraid

27:09.228 --> 27:12.801
that anyone he loves, or might love, will die.

27:13.565 --> 27:16.068
That's why when he was
so cold to you yesterday

27:16.135 --> 27:17.944
I knew he liked you.

27:20.072 --> 27:22.882
How's that for some paperback psychology?

27:24.810 --> 27:26.289
Makes sense.

27:31.383 --> 27:33.863
Everyone he loved can't have died.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.361
There is one who's survived.

27:41.093 --> 27:42.868
Up to now, anyway.

28:02.981 --> 28:04.255
And cut!

28:05.450 --> 28:06.758
I am not going to let

28:06.818 --> 28:08.798
that stupid jackass kill himself

28:08.854 --> 28:10.060
with my equipment.

28:10.122 --> 28:12.568
He can't talk to me like that. I'm the star.

28:12.624 --> 28:14.661
Blaze is right, Santini. He's the star.

28:14.726 --> 28:16.535
If he wants to kill himself, he can.

28:16.595 --> 28:17.699
Well, fine!

28:17.763 --> 28:19.640
Then let him use one of your cars,

28:19.698 --> 28:21.177
not my helicopter.

28:21.233 --> 28:24.373
I thought we already had
this worked out, Mitch.

28:24.503 --> 28:26.949
Listen, now. Maybe Santini's right, Blaze.

28:27.005 --> 28:30.009
I mean, we are talking
about life and limb here.

28:30.075 --> 28:33.420
Now, wait a… wait a minute.
You guys listen to me.

28:33.478 --> 28:34.650
Mona Kahn heard

28:34.713 --> 28:37.557
that I was doing my own flying in this flick.

28:37.616 --> 28:39.789
She's here to film me for her TV show.

28:39.851 --> 28:42.388
Well, I wonder how she heard that.

28:42.454 --> 28:45.025
She heard it because I did it before.

28:45.290 --> 28:48.760
I mean, I flew a hang glider
in… in… in Winds of Oahu.

28:48.827 --> 28:51.103
I flew a Navy jet in Wings of Gold.

28:51.163 --> 28:52.642
You had a Navy pilot with you.

28:52.698 --> 28:54.575
He told me I flew it!

28:54.633 --> 28:56.112
He… he said I was a natural,

28:56.168 --> 28:58.170
he said that I hardly had to touch the stick.

28:58.237 --> 29:01.377
And besides, Hawke has been
letting me fly for 3 months.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.351
I've been backing you.

29:04.876 --> 29:06.822
What does he mean by that?

29:06.878 --> 29:08.619
He means he's been on the controls

29:08.680 --> 29:10.717
correcting Blaze's mistakes.

29:10.782 --> 29:12.056
But I've been up there

29:12.117 --> 29:14.688
doing it for the cameras,
and I'm gonna do it for Mona!

29:14.753 --> 29:16.858
Either that or you can use your… your choppers

29:16.922 --> 29:18.959
to haul tourists around Disneyland.

29:19.024 --> 29:20.628
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

29:20.692 --> 29:23.536
Now you listen to me, Mr. Movie Star.

29:23.595 --> 29:24.733
Dominic.

29:24.796 --> 29:26.207
What?

29:26.265 --> 29:28.336
If the man says he can fly, let him.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.903
I'll ride shotgun to make it legal.

29:31.503 --> 29:32.641
But if you do that,

29:32.704 --> 29:34.377
Mona will think that you're flying.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.578
I won't touch the controls.

29:36.742 --> 29:38.244
If you do…

29:49.588 --> 29:51.898
You've got my word on it, Blaze.

29:56.962 --> 29:58.839
To tell you the truth, Mitch,

29:58.897 --> 30:01.207
I thought your star had
finally put it in the fire.

30:01.266 --> 30:03.542
Blaze? Come on, he's a
straight guy. You know that.

30:03.602 --> 30:04.706
Oh, yeah.

30:04.770 --> 30:06.807
So what's the other guy doing in the chopper?

30:06.872 --> 30:09.250
Hawke? Strictly for insurance purposes.

30:09.308 --> 30:11.254
We could never get coverage on Blaze

30:11.310 --> 30:12.414
for something like this.

30:12.477 --> 30:15.356
See, Hawke's hands and
feet are off the controls.

30:17.482 --> 30:18.790
Ready?

30:19.184 --> 30:20.492
You're the pilot.

30:20.552 --> 30:22.395
Right.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.771
What's wrong?

30:28.827 --> 30:30.773
Not enough left pedal.

30:34.466 --> 30:36.605
That's too much left pedal.

30:37.035 --> 30:39.015
What's that stunt called?

30:39.071 --> 30:41.347
Well, it… it doesn't have a name.

30:41.406 --> 30:43.044
You don't normally see that

30:43.108 --> 30:45.486
unless you've lost a tail rotor.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.332
There he is.

30:57.155 --> 30:59.692
Hawke, I'm gonna land now.

31:00.225 --> 31:01.670
You're the pilot.

31:01.727 --> 31:04.708
You can back me a little if you want, Hawke.

31:09.334 --> 31:10.836
Where is he?

31:18.744 --> 31:19.950
There!

31:27.085 --> 31:28.086
Hawke!

31:40.766 --> 31:42.268
What is that?

31:42.334 --> 31:43.779
A hammerhead stall.

31:43.835 --> 31:44.939
Is it safe?

31:45.003 --> 31:46.175
I don't know.

31:46.238 --> 31:48.775
I've never seen a helicopter do one.

32:11.229 --> 32:14.335
I always did say you had a lot of guts, Blaze.

32:35.053 --> 32:37.499
Moffett, don't do this.

32:37.789 --> 32:39.860
Leave him alone.

32:44.095 --> 32:47.406
Stop it! This is perverted.

32:47.532 --> 32:50.274
There's nothing wrong with
a little perversion, Mark,

32:50.335 --> 32:53.077
just so long as you don't hurt yourself.

33:12.858 --> 33:15.304
Look, 2 out of 3 isn't bad.

33:34.546 --> 33:35.718
Dr. Moffett,

33:35.780 --> 33:37.782
you are looking more and more like an Arab

33:37.849 --> 33:39.385
with each passing day.

33:39.451 --> 33:42.398
Actually, I am getting more and more bored.

33:42.521 --> 33:45.661
I think I would like to go to Tripoli tonight.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.965
Whatever you desire, Doctor.

33:49.761 --> 33:52.401
Perhaps you could do us a favor first.

33:52.464 --> 33:54.375
Our beleaguered freedom fighters in Chad

33:54.432 --> 33:55.536
are being assaulted

33:55.600 --> 33:57.511
by the most brutal and barbaric weapons

33:57.569 --> 33:59.480
in the imperialistic French arsenal.

33:59.538 --> 34:01.176
Their reputation for life…

34:01.239 --> 34:02.547
What exactly is it

34:02.607 --> 34:04.883
that your leader would like me to do?

34:04.943 --> 34:07.947
To remove a French Mirage or 2 from the sky.

34:08.413 --> 34:10.585
Oh, really? Is that all?

34:10.949 --> 34:12.587
For now, Doctor.

34:14.886 --> 34:16.297
Very well.

34:16.353 --> 34:18.061
At least it will relieve the boredom.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.728
Excellent, Doctor, excellent. I am curious.

34:20.792 --> 34:24.170
What would happen if a bullet
were to enter the intakes?

34:24.228 --> 34:27.938
Nothing. I deliberately designed
them with armored mesh shields.

34:27.998 --> 34:30.001
And the windshield is bulletproof,

34:30.068 --> 34:32.047
and the body armor-plated.

34:32.103 --> 34:34.242
What is your point, Major?

34:35.407 --> 34:36.545
My point, Doctor,

34:36.608 --> 34:39.350
is that in the desert we have a saying,

34:39.578 --> 34:42.114
“A lion can be killed by the jackal,”

34:42.414 --> 34:44.917
“if the jackal knows where to bite.”

34:47.319 --> 34:49.697
Where does a jackal bite a wolf?

34:51.389 --> 34:52.766
Come here.

34:57.629 --> 35:01.406
Just here. This is the,
mid-air refueling intake.

35:02.133 --> 35:03.510
Now, one bullet up there,

35:03.568 --> 35:06.048
and the whole thing would blow up.

35:20.151 --> 35:22.153
But not, I guess, today.

35:28.460 --> 35:30.770
You are insane, Doctor.

35:31.129 --> 35:33.666
Actually, no. I'm just quite bored.

35:52.851 --> 35:55.764
I have a target bearing 052 relative.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.630
Angels 5. Speed, 400 knots.

35:58.923 --> 36:00.231
Is your radar searching?

36:00.291 --> 36:02.328
Stand by, 1.

36:06.131 --> 36:08.168
Negative radar search.

36:08.233 --> 36:10.440
What type aircraft?

36:10.502 --> 36:11.742
Scanning.

36:11.803 --> 36:14.374
Got it. It's a Mirage.

36:14.739 --> 36:16.514
Bring the attack computer online

36:16.574 --> 36:18.986
and stand by for turbo ignition.

36:22.180 --> 36:25.354
Target at 7 miles, bearing 050 relative.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.124
Still at Angels 5.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.256
He doesn't see us.

36:29.320 --> 36:31.596
Deploy the ADF pod.

36:31.856 --> 36:33.665
Deployed.

36:38.863 --> 36:41.571
Now hold it right there.

36:44.169 --> 36:45.910
Thank you.

36:51.409 --> 36:53.116
And that, gentlemen,

36:53.178 --> 36:57.126
is another victory for Khadafy's
revolutionary forces in Chad.

37:08.226 --> 37:10.228
I'm sorry about that, Dominic.

37:10.295 --> 37:12.707
For what? Losing that job?

37:12.764 --> 37:14.607
Hell, I ain't had so much fun

37:14.666 --> 37:17.306
since your Dad took old Purdy up in his P-40.

37:18.636 --> 37:21.674
We were ferrying them, see,
over the hump to Chennault.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.913
The Firm's got a job for me.

37:23.975 --> 37:26.478
I thought you quit flying for them.

37:26.544 --> 37:29.184
They're going to go after Sin Jin.

37:31.950 --> 37:34.430
Don't do this to yourself String.

37:35.553 --> 37:38.227
You don't love your
brother any more than I do.

37:38.289 --> 37:39.495
If I thought it'd help,

37:39.557 --> 37:41.468
I'd go to Nam and hunt for him myself

37:41.526 --> 37:42.766
But it won't.

37:42.827 --> 37:45.569
He's gone and you've got to let him go.

37:47.665 --> 37:49.076
Like I did.

37:51.436 --> 37:53.712
Dom, I need your help.

37:54.539 --> 37:55.711
Doing what?

37:55.774 --> 37:58.084
Well, for starters,
you've got to get to Libya.

37:58.143 --> 38:00.248
Oh, sure, I'll just…

38:01.246 --> 38:04.352
Libya? Hey, that's Khadafy's sand pile.

38:04.482 --> 38:06.655
He doesn't like us, String.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.789
We don't like him, either.

38:11.656 --> 38:13.226
Will you do it?

38:13.291 --> 38:14.531
Well, let's see.

38:14.592 --> 38:16.765
Tony Boswick's got a charter

38:16.828 --> 38:19.399
flying oil rigs to Libya from England.

38:19.464 --> 38:22.001
I could probably fly co-pilot
on one of his flights.

38:22.066 --> 38:23.136
Sure, I can do it.

38:23.201 --> 38:24.805
Hey, but why can't I go with you?

38:24.869 --> 38:28.043
I don't want the Firm to
know you're backing me.

38:29.474 --> 38:31.818
I am liking this less and less.

38:32.310 --> 38:34.950
What're we gonna do? Kidnap Khadafy?

38:37.348 --> 38:39.157
Nothing that simple.

39:34.305 --> 39:37.184
Archangel wouldn't let them take it.

39:37.242 --> 39:39.688
He didn't want the Firm to take your art,

39:39.744 --> 39:42.088
but the committee overruled him.

39:42.146 --> 39:43.386
Why?

39:44.215 --> 39:47.162
You turned down $1 million.
That made them nervous.

39:47.218 --> 39:48.925
In exchange for Sin Jin.

39:48.987 --> 39:50.728
Well, that frightened them even more.

39:50.788 --> 39:52.631
They're not even going to try, are they?

39:52.690 --> 39:55.569
The Firm will do all it
can to find your brother.

39:55.627 --> 39:57.607
They're concerned you won't take the mission

39:57.662 --> 39:59.164
till they have something tangible.

39:59.230 --> 40:00.402
They can't wait.

40:00.465 --> 40:03.571
You're the only man besides
Moffett who's flown Airwolf.

40:03.635 --> 40:06.138
You're the only one who has
a chance to get it back.

40:06.204 --> 40:09.014
Why didn't Archangel stay to tell me himself?

40:09.073 --> 40:11.519
He was called back to Washington.

40:11.809 --> 40:14.688
Besides, I was always the one
who was going to brief you.

40:14.746 --> 40:16.054
Maybe.

40:17.815 --> 40:20.261
Maybe he knew I'd take him apart.

40:38.770 --> 40:40.750
Did Tet put up a fight?

40:41.673 --> 40:42.811
No.

40:45.443 --> 40:46.854
Smart dog.

41:34.692 --> 41:37.002
I don't understand what you Westerners see

41:37.061 --> 41:39.507
in women with such skinny bodies.

41:40.131 --> 41:41.769
In the desert,

41:41.833 --> 41:44.245
a body like this would wither and die

41:44.302 --> 41:46.009
in a matter of hours.

41:46.871 --> 41:48.714
After a few hours with such a body,

41:48.773 --> 41:49.774
what would it matter?

42:04.889 --> 42:06.334
I want her.

42:09.861 --> 42:11.772
That will be difficult.

42:12.997 --> 42:15.807
We believe she is an American spy.

42:19.504 --> 42:22.007
Perhaps I can question her for you.

42:22.740 --> 42:24.378
I could do that.

42:25.743 --> 42:27.723
Of course, Brother Khadafy

42:27.779 --> 42:28.814
was most pleased

42:28.880 --> 42:30.291
with your exploits this afternoon

42:30.348 --> 42:32.259
against the French on behalf of

42:32.316 --> 42:34.353
our beleaguered freedom fighters in Chad.

42:34.419 --> 42:37.593
Your destruction of 2 French Mirage fighters

42:37.655 --> 42:40.158
will be told about in the camps of our people

42:40.224 --> 42:42.761
until the desert sand turns to water.

42:42.827 --> 42:44.932
But it's still not enough to pay for her.

42:45.997 --> 42:47.874
There are many women here who are just…

42:47.932 --> 42:49.411
What is?

42:52.703 --> 42:54.614
An American destroyer.

43:00.278 --> 43:01.348
Done.

43:27.238 --> 43:29.013
Her name is Angela.

43:30.241 --> 43:32.687
She is a dancer at the Red Castle.

43:37.515 --> 43:40.018
You're not listening, Stringfellow.

43:40.384 --> 43:42.591
She's our contact in Tripoli.

43:45.189 --> 43:47.032
Where does Archangel get them?

43:47.158 --> 43:49.035
He found me when I was 15.

43:49.327 --> 43:51.637
That was a rhetorical question.

43:56.300 --> 43:58.177
According to Angela,

43:58.236 --> 43:59.738
Airwolf's located

43:59.804 --> 44:01.215
along the coast west of Tripoli.

44:01.272 --> 44:02.615
We have reason to believe

44:02.673 --> 44:04.778
it's been used against the French in Chad.

44:04.842 --> 44:06.913
A Mirage fighter was shot down yesterday

44:06.978 --> 44:08.457
over the desert there.

44:12.150 --> 44:13.493
Sit down!

44:13.918 --> 44:15.556
Hand me that net.

44:28.232 --> 44:29.802
It's beautiful!

44:32.036 --> 44:33.811
About 3 pounds.

44:37.642 --> 44:39.053
Now put it back.

44:42.446 --> 44:44.050
It's… beau… I couldn't eat that.

44:44.115 --> 44:45.116
It's beautiful.

44:45.183 --> 44:46.890
You can't kill it.

44:49.987 --> 44:51.694
Put it back, okay?

44:58.162 --> 44:59.368
Please.

45:03.801 --> 45:06.873
You're eating the poor thing just to spite me.

45:09.707 --> 45:12.313
I suppose you think I'm being stupid.

45:16.881 --> 45:20.522
I know people eat fish. I eat fish.

45:22.486 --> 45:25.262
It's just that trout was very beautiful.

45:27.992 --> 45:29.596
Yeah, I think I understand.

45:30.528 --> 45:32.166
Do you?

45:33.297 --> 45:35.573
Well, you just like to eat ugly fish.

45:37.568 --> 45:39.741
I don't know. Maybe that's it.

45:39.804 --> 45:41.249
You know, like sole.

45:41.305 --> 45:43.307
You know, sole has 2 eyes

45:43.374 --> 45:45.752
on one side of his head. That is an ugly fish.

45:46.310 --> 45:47.721
Yeah, I like sole.

45:47.778 --> 45:49.155
And pig.

45:49.213 --> 45:51.250
That's not one of God's
most beautiful creatures,

45:51.315 --> 45:52.851
but I bet you like pork.

45:52.917 --> 45:54.487
Yeah, pork's okay.

45:54.986 --> 45:56.363
And lamb?

45:56.420 --> 45:58.366
Yeah. I love lamb.

45:59.123 --> 46:01.933
Cute, cuddly, woolly little lambs.

46:21.379 --> 46:24.326
You know, anyone who would teach a dog to…

46:43.367 --> 46:45.540
Another fishing boat. 12 o'clock.

46:54.745 --> 46:56.884
We are being radar scanned.

46:59.116 --> 47:01.892
Able to absorb 93% of the signal.

47:02.720 --> 47:05.098
It's American Naval frequencies.

47:10.161 --> 47:13.074
The radar is emanating
from a Knox-class destroyer.

47:13.130 --> 47:15.110
Bring a Bullpup on the line.

47:15.232 --> 47:17.212
It's an American destroyer, Moffett.

47:17.268 --> 47:19.407
Bring a Bullpup on the line.

47:30.314 --> 47:32.658
For God's sake, Moffett, they're Americans.

47:51.168 --> 47:53.614
Missile is 5 miles from target.

47:53.971 --> 47:55.348
4 miles…

47:55.940 --> 47:57.112
3…

47:58.075 --> 47:59.213
2…

48:00.311 --> 48:01.381
1…

48:05.149 --> 48:06.594
The missile is detonated.

49:34.472 --> 49:36.008
That was lovely.

49:36.073 --> 49:38.280
You know, it's obvious
you studied with culture.

49:39.009 --> 49:40.579
You seem to know everything about me.

49:40.644 --> 49:42.146
No, I don't.

49:43.280 --> 49:45.692
I knew you played the cello well.

49:46.717 --> 49:49.197
I didn't know you serenaded eagles.

49:50.821 --> 49:53.301
I'm trying to get her to trust me.

49:56.393 --> 49:57.497
To make her understand

49:57.561 --> 49:59.302
I won't hurt her if she gets close.

51:15.172 --> 51:16.173
String,

51:16.240 --> 51:18.618
if you don't teach that mutt
to keep out of my way,

51:18.676 --> 51:20.417
so help me, I'm gonna land on him!

51:21.645 --> 51:23.386
You know, I wouldn't want to tell anyone

51:23.447 --> 51:24.482
where to land.

51:24.548 --> 51:26.494
And you could've given me a hand.

51:26.550 --> 51:28.826
He's not big on helping hands.

51:30.020 --> 51:31.328
But I am.

51:33.524 --> 51:34.935
Hey, let me take one of those.

51:34.992 --> 51:36.062
No, no, no, no, no.

51:36.126 --> 51:38.072
I… I don't believe in women's lib.

51:38.295 --> 51:39.603
Excuse me?

51:39.663 --> 51:41.040
I… I like…

51:41.098 --> 51:44.045
I like the sexes the way God intended them.

51:44.101 --> 51:46.138
The way God intended them?

51:46.203 --> 51:48.012
I wouldn't press him, Gabrielle.

51:48.138 --> 51:49.947
You won't like the answers.

51:51.475 --> 51:53.045
Well, I guess I'm old-fashioned,

51:53.110 --> 51:55.681
but, that's my privilege, right?

51:55.746 --> 51:56.690
Right.

51:56.747 --> 51:58.749
So long as you've got some red meat in there.

51:59.249 --> 52:03.322
Oh, I got steaks, and chops,
and burgers, and all of it.

52:04.488 --> 52:06.490
Well, Tet and I end up eating most of them,

52:06.590 --> 52:08.536
but, we keep hopin'.

52:08.792 --> 52:09.827
Bless your heart.

52:09.893 --> 52:12.601
I haven't had anything
but vegetables for 6 days.

52:14.665 --> 52:16.303
6 days?

52:23.874 --> 52:26.514
I was beginning to feel like a carrot.

52:26.677 --> 52:28.418
You could have been a beautiful fish.

52:29.480 --> 52:31.221
Cute.

52:31.415 --> 52:34.521
Hey, Dom, I think I found a canyon

52:34.585 --> 52:36.656
deep enough to do that crop duster chase.

52:38.088 --> 52:39.999
For Bellisario's film.

52:43.727 --> 52:45.070
It will only take an hour or so.

52:45.129 --> 52:46.472
You wanna fix dinner?

52:46.630 --> 52:47.700
Sure.

52:48.565 --> 52:49.771
How do you like your steak?

52:49.833 --> 52:51.107
Oh, no, no, no. Count me out.

52:51.168 --> 52:53.842
I'm headin' for the field
just as soon as we get back.

52:54.104 --> 52:55.777
Just put on 2.

52:56.306 --> 52:57.614
2?

52:57.675 --> 52:59.518
Yeah, 1 for Tet and 1 for you.

53:01.979 --> 53:03.322
Oh, yeah, and…

53:04.515 --> 53:06.358
and catch me a trout.

53:10.087 --> 53:11.725
Nice meeting you, Gabrielle.

53:11.855 --> 53:13.493
Yeah, you, too, Mr. Santini.

53:17.628 --> 53:19.938
Well, how do you like your steak, Tet?

53:27.004 --> 53:28.506
I like her, String.

53:28.872 --> 53:30.613
A little skinny maybe, but I like her.

53:31.041 --> 53:33.419
Yeah, she'll be thrilled to hear that.

53:33.644 --> 53:35.954
Yeah, but don't tell her the skinny part.

53:37.047 --> 53:39.288
Did you get in touch with Tony Boswick?

53:39.349 --> 53:40.487
Get in touch?

53:40.551 --> 53:42.326
He kept me on the phone for over an hour.

53:42.386 --> 53:45.026
From England, yet. And with me payin'.

53:47.124 --> 53:48.797
He remembered the time

53:48.859 --> 53:51.601
that he and your Dad and
I got drunk in Towbridge

53:51.662 --> 53:53.039
after the Schweinfurt raid,

53:53.097 --> 53:55.304
and we stole a pig from a nunnery.

53:58.802 --> 54:00.509
We took him back to the field,

54:00.571 --> 54:02.847
fed him 8 boxes of prunes, and locked him

54:02.906 --> 54:03.941
in General Baxter's office,

54:04.007 --> 54:06.078
overnight.

54:08.145 --> 54:11.024
Well, the next morning, that office was…

54:15.919 --> 54:18.092
I guess you had to be there.

54:22.259 --> 54:24.068
When does Boswick's charter fly to Libya?

54:24.128 --> 54:25.300
Every Friday.

54:25.362 --> 54:27.273
He's gonna have his engineer call in sick

54:27.331 --> 54:29.277
at the last second and I'll replace him.

54:29.433 --> 54:31.276
But he can only pull it off once.

54:31.335 --> 54:32.279
More than that,

54:32.336 --> 54:33.644
the Libyans will get suspicious.

54:33.704 --> 54:35.615
Once is all we'll need.

54:35.806 --> 54:38.616
I'll fly to Tripoli a week from Wednesday.

54:38.675 --> 54:40.586
If you come in the Friday after that,

54:40.644 --> 54:43.022
it will give me 2 days to set things up.

54:44.481 --> 54:47.428
I'll meet you in a club called the Red Castle.

54:47.785 --> 54:49.458
The Red Castle. Okay.

54:50.020 --> 54:51.397
How long till we get there?

54:52.122 --> 54:53.533
About an hour.

54:59.596 --> 55:01.974
This is it. Valley of the Gods.

55:04.968 --> 55:07.039
Even the Indians don't come up here.

55:07.104 --> 55:09.584
Can you blame 'em? It's cold.

55:10.774 --> 55:12.344
There's always a little snow up here,

55:12.409 --> 55:13.410
even in summer.

55:14.211 --> 55:16.157
Sure would be a bad place to go down.

55:16.213 --> 55:17.658
They'd never find you.

55:17.714 --> 55:19.421
That's just what I'm looking for.

55:19.550 --> 55:21.291
Some place to get lost.

55:22.319 --> 55:24.196
Well, I've got that.

55:57.588 --> 55:59.465
How far down does it go?

55:59.523 --> 56:02.504
I don't know. I never
hovered into it before.

56:19.910 --> 56:21.981
Thanks, Dom. it's perfect.

56:22.045 --> 56:24.252
Anytime, String, anytime.

56:35.425 --> 56:36.426
Hey, Tet.

56:37.461 --> 56:40.101
You tell her how you want your steak?

56:42.933 --> 56:45.607
That smells so good, I'm almost tempted to…

56:47.170 --> 56:48.376
Hope you don't mind.

56:48.438 --> 56:49.576
Since you don't eat meat,

56:49.640 --> 56:51.119
I didn't want it to go to waste.

56:51.808 --> 56:52.980
Where's Gabrielle?

56:53.043 --> 56:54.113
I sent her ahead.

56:54.177 --> 56:55.656
We're moving up the timetable.

56:56.179 --> 56:57.817
4 hours ago, one of our destroyers

56:57.881 --> 56:59.690
went down in the Gulf of Sirte.

56:59.750 --> 57:00.922
The press is being told

57:00.984 --> 57:02.759
that a missile went off in the magazine.

57:02.819 --> 57:05.629
That it was an accident. It was Airwolf.

57:09.259 --> 57:10.567
Damn it.

57:10.894 --> 57:13.875
The President used slightly stronger language.

57:13.964 --> 57:16.001
We've got 48 hours to recover Airwolf

57:16.066 --> 57:17.841
or they're sending in the Marines.

57:17.901 --> 57:20.040
The Russians have a missile task force

57:20.103 --> 57:22.413
shadowing our carrier group in the Med.

57:22.906 --> 57:24.249
If we invade Libya,

57:24.308 --> 57:26.151
chances are it'll mean World War III.

57:27.411 --> 57:29.550
Damn, that was a good steak.

57:34.284 --> 57:35.957
There's our ride.

57:36.019 --> 57:37.999
I've got 10 hours to get you to Paris

57:38.055 --> 57:39.762
to catch a flight to Libya.

57:41.458 --> 57:43.768
I'll have someone stay
here to watch the place,

57:43.827 --> 57:45.898
take care of your dog.

57:45.963 --> 57:48.034
Tet takes care of himself.

57:49.599 --> 57:51.840
Why'd you leave Gabrielle here last week?

57:51.902 --> 57:53.643
To brief you.

57:54.905 --> 57:57.112
What about my art collection?

57:59.009 --> 58:00.955
I'm sorry about that, Hawke.

58:01.011 --> 58:04.220
I told the committee it
was the wrong thing to do.

58:05.549 --> 58:07.688
I might have taken it out on her.

58:08.051 --> 58:09.860
You didn't, did you?

58:10.887 --> 58:11.888
No.

58:22.899 --> 58:24.708
I saved it for you.

58:46.690 --> 58:48.465
Stringfellow Hawke?

58:51.595 --> 58:54.075
Strip out of your clothes, please.

58:54.464 --> 58:56.171
Your flight suit, take it off.

58:56.233 --> 58:57.940
We only have 16 minutes.

59:00.537 --> 59:02.778
Your name is Michael Derrick.

59:02.839 --> 59:05.149
I was briefed as Dr. Ted Burger.

59:05.208 --> 59:07.449
Dr. Burger was to go to work next Wednesday.

59:07.511 --> 59:08.922
The Firm had to pick another man

59:08.979 --> 59:10.356
on this flight.

59:10.647 --> 59:11.819
As near as we can tell,

59:11.882 --> 59:13.589
Michael Derrick has never gone to school

59:13.650 --> 59:15.596
or worked with any of the other passengers.

59:16.686 --> 59:18.256
As near as you can tell?

59:18.321 --> 59:21.302
10 hours is rather short notice, Mr. Hawke.

59:21.925 --> 59:23.632
Follow me, please.

59:24.261 --> 59:25.365
He's been working

59:25.429 --> 59:27.431
in a remote section of Argentina for 5 years

59:27.497 --> 59:28.840
and went to college in Australia.

59:28.899 --> 59:30.435
I don't think you'll run into anybody

59:30.500 --> 59:31.501
who knows him.

59:31.568 --> 59:33.741
I've had his background
capsulized in story form.

59:33.804 --> 59:34.782
Chapter 10.

59:34.838 --> 59:37.148
Try to read it before you
speak to anyone on the plane.

59:37.207 --> 59:38.277
Latin Lovers?

59:38.341 --> 59:40.753
I told you, I only had 10 hours.

59:41.778 --> 59:44.349
You've 40,000 francs, a driver's license,

59:44.414 --> 59:47.156
girlfriend's photo, love letter from her

59:47.217 --> 59:49.754
and 10 minutes to catch your flight.

59:50.854 --> 59:52.231
Thank you.

59:52.289 --> 59:54.530
I was able to get clothing in your sizes.

59:54.591 --> 59:55.729
Of course, it's used.

59:55.792 --> 59:57.294
Even the underwear, I'm afraid.

59:57.360 --> 59:59.306
I never wear underwear.

01:00:02.933 --> 01:00:05.311
You're on Air Libya, Flight 2.

01:00:06.870 --> 01:00:08.474
One more thing.

01:00:08.805 --> 01:00:09.875
Angela is dead.

01:00:10.340 --> 01:00:11.318
How?

01:00:11.374 --> 01:00:13.411
We don't know. Her family simply received

01:00:13.477 --> 01:00:15.582
a wire notifying them of her death.

01:00:15.779 --> 01:00:17.087
We're hoping it was an accident.

01:00:17.147 --> 01:00:18.217
Hoping?

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:20.261
If the Libyans made her and she talked,

01:00:20.317 --> 01:00:21.455
they'll know I'm coming.

01:00:21.518 --> 01:00:22.997
We don't think they do.

01:00:23.120 --> 01:00:24.599
You don't think?

01:00:24.654 --> 01:00:26.065
There was no time to check.

01:00:26.123 --> 01:00:28.194
All we could do was to
send in another operative

01:00:28.258 --> 01:00:30.295
who was familiar with the situation.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:32.169
What other operative?

01:01:02.926 --> 01:01:04.872
Is this one a spy, too?

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:07.138
Probably. She was supplied

01:01:07.197 --> 01:01:09.473
by the same theatrical agency as Angela.

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:13.748
Angela was very fragile.

01:01:14.538 --> 01:01:17.781
This one appears to be
a little more substantial.

01:01:18.275 --> 01:01:19.982
Are you going to be questioning her?

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:22.551
Eventually.

01:01:22.779 --> 01:01:24.918
Perhaps I could be of help.

01:02:43.593 --> 01:02:45.129
You all right?

01:02:47.697 --> 01:02:49.267
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:02:51.835 --> 01:02:54.281
What the hell are you doin' here?

01:02:55.171 --> 01:02:56.411
My job.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:01.646
It was Angela's job, too.

01:03:09.586 --> 01:03:10.826
I know.

01:03:12.756 --> 01:03:15.737
The girls said they found her in the desert.

01:03:16.092 --> 01:03:17.594
He tortured and killed her,

01:03:17.661 --> 01:03:19.299
the same as he did to those other girls

01:03:19.362 --> 01:03:20.568
at White Sands.

01:03:24.701 --> 01:03:25.805
You were right about Moffett.

01:03:25.869 --> 01:03:27.405
It wasn't the money.

01:03:27.937 --> 01:03:29.575
He stole Airwolf so he could come here

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:32.017
and do exactly what he wanted with women.

01:03:36.946 --> 01:03:38.186
Probably.

01:03:39.983 --> 01:03:42.429
If I see him, I'm gonna kill him.

01:03:59.469 --> 01:04:01.107
Where's Airwolf?

01:04:02.739 --> 01:04:04.446
It's at Kafir.

01:04:04.974 --> 01:04:06.351
That's Khadafy's summer palace

01:04:06.409 --> 01:04:07.410
on the coast.

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:10.649
Mirabelle has an oil pumping station

01:04:10.714 --> 01:04:11.715
next to it.

01:04:12.082 --> 01:04:14.460
Angela arranged papers and a truck

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:15.791
for the 2 of you to get in.

01:04:17.954 --> 01:04:19.331
Here's the address.

01:04:19.389 --> 01:04:21.130
There are guns under the seat.

01:04:21.191 --> 01:04:23.000
I'll meet you there by 2:00.

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:26.401
How do I get from the pumping station

01:04:26.463 --> 01:04:27.464
into the palace?

01:04:30.300 --> 01:04:31.938
Along the beach.

01:04:34.037 --> 01:04:35.812
What do you mean "I"?

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:38.852
We're in this together.

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:43.419
You're on the next Air
Force flight out of here.

01:04:43.747 --> 01:04:45.283
The hell I am.

01:04:47.117 --> 01:04:49.393
I can fly Airwolf, you can't.

01:04:49.886 --> 01:04:52.560
Either you're on that flight, or I am.

01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:58.234
You're not serious?

01:05:02.332 --> 01:05:05.677
Stringfellow, I'm not like the others.

01:05:06.636 --> 01:05:08.843
I'm not going to die on you.

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:14.151
I'm gonna live to be an old woman,

01:05:14.210 --> 01:05:15.883
130, easy.

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:20.450
I won't die, I promise.

01:05:28.124 --> 01:05:29.501
Damn you.

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:32.836
I didn't mean that.

01:05:34.364 --> 01:05:35.672
I know.

01:05:37.100 --> 01:05:38.101
I know.

01:05:45.809 --> 01:05:47.117
I'll go.

01:05:49.612 --> 01:05:52.388
If you don't come back, I don't know…

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:03.798
I always come back, Gabrielle.

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:06.168
That's the problem.

01:06:29.185 --> 01:06:30.323
Hey, mister.

01:06:30.653 --> 01:06:33.327
Wait a minute. Hey, hey, hey, it's me.

01:06:33.857 --> 01:06:35.837
You weren't supposed to be here till Friday.

01:06:35.892 --> 01:06:37.963
Then I'll go back.

01:06:47.036 --> 01:06:48.674
Hold it. Police.

01:07:14.531 --> 01:07:17.171
Well, I caught the news about that destroyer.

01:07:17.233 --> 01:07:19.839
I figured Airwolf might be behind it,

01:07:19.903 --> 01:07:23.146
so I flew out to the cabin and found Tet

01:07:23.206 --> 01:07:26.153
makin' eyes at some cute little thing in white

01:07:26.209 --> 01:07:28.587
who said she was house sittin' for you.

01:07:28.645 --> 01:07:29.783
Didn't take a genius

01:07:29.846 --> 01:07:31.519
to figure out what happened, you know.

01:07:31.581 --> 01:07:33.151
How long have you been here?

01:07:33.283 --> 01:07:34.853
A couple of hours.

01:07:34.918 --> 01:07:36.693
I hung around in the club for a while,

01:07:36.753 --> 01:07:38.323
but too many guys started asking

01:07:38.388 --> 01:07:39.526
too many questions.

01:07:39.589 --> 01:07:41.728
So I decided to stay out in the alley.

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:44.635
You always did like to take
the back way out of bars.

01:07:44.694 --> 01:07:46.901
It's nice to see you, too, Dom.

01:07:47.764 --> 01:07:50.074
You think you can get this thing started?

01:07:50.133 --> 01:07:51.703
Hey, piece of cake.

01:07:52.569 --> 01:07:54.071
You sure are confident.

01:07:54.704 --> 01:07:56.240
The keys are in it.

01:08:02.712 --> 01:08:04.953
And you know something, String?

01:08:05.014 --> 01:08:07.221
I could've sworn one of those dancing girls

01:08:07.283 --> 01:08:08.660
was Gabrielle.

01:08:09.385 --> 01:08:10.591
It was.

01:08:10.653 --> 01:08:12.997
She going out with us?

01:08:13.489 --> 01:08:14.797
Ahead of us.

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.296
You know, girls didn't move like that

01:08:19.395 --> 01:08:20.395
when I was young.

01:08:20.462 --> 01:08:21.464
Dom…

01:08:21.531 --> 01:08:22.669
Boy.

01:08:22.732 --> 01:08:25.975
Of course, there was this one
that we met in Brazil in '43,

01:08:26.035 --> 01:08:27.479
your old man and I.

01:08:27.904 --> 01:08:30.111
…she could vibrate like a jackhammer.

01:08:30.473 --> 01:08:32.453
And she was as cute as a bug in a rug.

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:33.953
Your old man thought that…

01:08:34.010 --> 01:08:35.318
Dom, just start the car.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:36.752
Sure, sure.

01:08:38.014 --> 01:08:40.995
Like I was sayin', your old man thought

01:08:41.050 --> 01:08:43.724
she was the greatest thing
since peanut butter.

01:08:45.755 --> 01:08:47.894
Of course, he hadn't met your Mom yet.

01:08:47.957 --> 01:08:51.301
Anyway, we had 48 hours
before jumpin' off for Africa

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:54.001
in a couple of B-17s we
were ferryin' to Rabat,

01:08:54.063 --> 01:08:56.167
when all hell broke loose.

01:09:00.970 --> 01:09:02.346
Drop your hand.

01:09:02.471 --> 01:09:03.849
I can't see a thing.

01:09:05.774 --> 01:09:06.981
Name.

01:09:09.545 --> 01:09:11.286
You have my passport.

01:09:12.314 --> 01:09:14.090
Name.

01:09:15.184 --> 01:09:16.959
Gabrielle Ademaur.

01:09:19.488 --> 01:09:21.229
Occupation.

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:23.198
God, I don't believe this.

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:27.566
Just answer my question.

01:09:30.133 --> 01:09:31.510
I'm a hoofer.

01:09:32.068 --> 01:09:33.479
A hoofer?

01:09:37.106 --> 01:09:38.846
Yeah, it's a dancer.

01:09:40.475 --> 01:09:41.477
Gabrielle.

01:09:43.379 --> 01:09:45.586
If that is your real name…

01:09:45.648 --> 01:09:48.219
You're damn right it's my real name.

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:50.987
We know you are a spy for the Firm.

01:09:51.754 --> 01:09:52.755
Oh, God.

01:09:53.389 --> 01:09:55.164
You people, you are really paranoid.

01:09:55.224 --> 01:09:56.464
Just because I'm American

01:09:56.526 --> 01:09:59.973
doesn't mean I'm a spy, okay? I'm a dancer.

01:10:01.097 --> 01:10:03.703
I'm under contract to Mirabelle Oil.

01:10:08.838 --> 01:10:10.249
I'd like to see someone

01:10:10.306 --> 01:10:12.047
from the American Embassy now.

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:16.219
There is no American Embassy in Tripoli.

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:21.627
Then I'd like to see someone
who'll listen to reason.

01:10:23.152 --> 01:10:25.689
Perhaps I can be of some help.

01:10:43.206 --> 01:10:44.844
Background Eagles airborne.

01:10:44.907 --> 01:10:47.911
Altitude established 4,500 - heading 040.

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:50.690
Angels 10, heading 170.

01:10:51.013 --> 01:10:53.152
Straight at the Libyan coast.

01:10:53.616 --> 01:10:55.289
You trying to egg them out?

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:57.125
There's no need for that, sir.

01:10:57.487 --> 01:10:59.330
If your boys don't get that chopper

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:00.867
in 4 hours,

01:11:00.923 --> 01:11:03.335
our boys go in and blow it away.

01:11:03.659 --> 01:11:06.196
Our "boys," Captain, include women,

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:08.266
1 of whom has already given her life

01:11:08.331 --> 01:11:09.332
on this mission.

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:13.772
I'm sorry, ma'am. It's
just a figure of speech.

01:11:13.836 --> 01:11:15.543
Eagle patrol at angels 40.

01:11:15.605 --> 01:11:17.278
Eagle, 180 video.

01:11:23.713 --> 01:11:25.659
It's funny, isn't it?

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:29.222
All this… this hot sand and yet

01:11:29.552 --> 01:11:31.122
you can… you can see the blue waters

01:11:31.187 --> 01:11:32.495
of the Mediterranean

01:11:32.555 --> 01:11:35.468
just a few miles away.

01:11:42.565 --> 01:11:44.272
Would you like a little?

01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:46.546
Yes, I'd like a little.

01:11:47.603 --> 01:11:49.549
A little you shall have.

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:36.423
Hey, what the hell is it?

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:38.988
A TU-36 Dodger. It's Russian-made.

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:40.790
You see those air-to-air missiles?

01:12:42.158 --> 01:12:43.569
You know, String,

01:12:43.626 --> 01:12:46.163
in the past 2 hours we've seen tanks,

01:12:46.229 --> 01:12:48.709
anti-aircraft guns, SAM missile sites,

01:12:48.764 --> 01:12:50.107
and now a gunship.

01:12:50.166 --> 01:12:52.077
You wanna check it out?

01:12:53.469 --> 01:12:54.447
So do I.

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:08.752
Try French.

01:13:09.285 --> 01:13:10.559
Buon giorno.

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:11.994
That's Italian.

01:13:12.488 --> 01:13:14.399
I don't speak French.

01:13:24.533 --> 01:13:25.705
Si.

01:13:29.405 --> 01:13:31.646
The papers are for next Saturday.

01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:00.202
Grazie. Grazie molto.

01:14:01.337 --> 01:14:02.475
Molto gentile.

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:04.217
See, everybody speaks Italian.

01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:05.819
Yeah, except me.

01:14:06.042 --> 01:14:08.682
If you and Sin Jin had only studied Italian

01:14:08.744 --> 01:14:09.779
like I asked you…

01:14:09.845 --> 01:14:11.882
But, no, you got a hard head.

01:14:12.982 --> 01:14:13.960
Dom.

01:14:32.568 --> 01:14:34.570
You are very beautiful.

01:14:35.638 --> 01:14:38.346
Well, perhaps not at the moment,

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:41.310
but you can be again.

01:14:45.548 --> 01:14:49.792
The water is so blue, so cool.

01:14:51.721 --> 01:14:54.258
Would you like me to take you to it?

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:57.428
We could… we could be there in 10 minutes.

01:14:59.462 --> 01:15:01.738
But that would be cruel.

01:15:01.797 --> 01:15:04.801
The Mediterranean is very salty.

01:16:17.239 --> 01:16:18.616
Where's Gordon?

01:16:40.830 --> 01:16:42.639
Come on, Chuck.

01:16:42.698 --> 01:16:44.871
You can't just swim, eat grapes,

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:46.311
and play around all the time.

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:47.904
What's the matter with you?

01:16:50.406 --> 01:16:52.716
I just talked to
Captain Ben Mofta.

01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:55.119
He said Moffett has… has that dancer

01:16:55.177 --> 01:16:56.212
from the Red Castle

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:58.121
staked out to a sand dune somewhere,

01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.250
torturing her.

01:16:59.315 --> 01:17:00.988
So what? She's nothin' to us.

01:17:01.584 --> 01:17:03.291
Well, she is to me.

01:17:08.324 --> 01:17:09.769
Of course, there is still time

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:11.566
for me to save you, Gabrielle.

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:15.442
I mean, you may scar a little,

01:17:15.564 --> 01:17:17.566
but isn't that better than dying?

01:17:20.002 --> 01:17:22.983
Would you like me to save you, Gabrielle?

01:18:20.796 --> 01:18:21.968
Moffett?

01:18:22.097 --> 01:18:23.269
He's inside.

01:18:23.499 --> 01:18:24.944
You were told to stand down.

01:18:25.067 --> 01:18:26.512
Check flight.

01:18:28.037 --> 01:18:29.573
Just a minute.

01:18:32.274 --> 01:18:33.981
Start the engines.

01:18:57.366 --> 01:19:01.109
Charles, why do you have
your helmet on in this heat?

01:19:06.642 --> 01:19:08.212
Lift your visor.

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:10.181
"Start it," he says.

01:19:10.846 --> 01:19:12.621
Lift your visor.

01:20:01.997 --> 01:20:04.102
Give me the chain guns and the ADF pod.

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:06.840
Offensive weapons panel. Right rear!

01:20:09.271 --> 01:20:10.841
Guns 1 and 2.

01:20:15.177 --> 01:20:16.315
Set.

01:20:57.353 --> 01:20:59.026
God in heavens!

01:21:22.878 --> 01:21:24.255
See anything?

01:21:24.380 --> 01:21:25.757
Nothin'.

01:21:26.382 --> 01:21:29.454
But I ain't sure I'm workin' it right, either.

01:21:32.888 --> 01:21:34.128
Tracks.

01:21:48.237 --> 01:21:51.116
Hey, String. I got it workin'.

01:21:51.774 --> 01:21:54.482
Yeah, I can see real good.

01:21:54.910 --> 01:21:56.218
Hey, I… I can see…

01:22:01.650 --> 01:22:03.254
Oh, my God.

01:22:31.680 --> 01:22:34.661
Bring the canteen in the port storage bin.

01:22:50.199 --> 01:22:51.200
Gabrielle.

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:55.715
Oh, easy, baby, it's over.

01:23:00.075 --> 01:23:01.076
String.

01:23:02.244 --> 01:23:05.020
It's okay. It's gonna be all right.

01:23:05.080 --> 01:23:06.081
String.

01:23:11.086 --> 01:23:14.033
I was going to call, but Moffett…

01:23:14.957 --> 01:23:16.197
I know.

01:23:18.760 --> 01:23:20.330
I understand.

01:23:20.996 --> 01:23:22.498
I wanted to see the eagle.

01:23:23.298 --> 01:23:24.800
You will.

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:30.074
I remember you and the eagle all the time.

01:23:31.139 --> 01:23:32.743
All the time.

01:23:38.847 --> 01:23:39.848
Gabrielle.

01:23:40.582 --> 01:23:41.583
Gabrielle.

01:23:42.584 --> 01:23:43.995
No.

01:23:46.989 --> 01:23:48.866
She promised me, damn it!

01:23:48.991 --> 01:23:50.902
She promised me.

01:29:17.185 --> 01:29:20.132
String, it's done.

01:29:47.249 --> 01:29:49.422
I'm afraid we've lost him.

01:29:50.385 --> 01:29:52.626
He definitely cleared Libyan airspace.

01:29:52.687 --> 01:29:55.531
2 F-14s from the Enterprise
were escorting him back

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:57.433
when he disappeared.

01:29:57.559 --> 01:29:59.869
I don't give a damn what the committee thinks.

01:29:59.928 --> 01:30:01.874
This time we're gonna do it my way or you can

01:30:01.930 --> 01:30:03.967
kiss Airwolf goodbye permanently.

01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:09.508
Could we borrow one of your F-14s?

01:31:32.754 --> 01:31:35.360
The committee finally saw it my way.

01:31:37.425 --> 01:31:39.632
Where did you hide it, Hawke?

01:31:39.728 --> 01:31:42.231
In the mountains? The desert?

01:31:44.099 --> 01:31:47.239
At that junkyard Santini calls an airfield?

01:31:48.370 --> 01:31:50.247
I know he was with you in Libya.

01:31:50.939 --> 01:31:52.850
It'll be our little secret.

01:31:52.974 --> 01:31:55.011
But you've got to return it

01:31:55.076 --> 01:31:57.181
or they'll throw you in a hole so deep,

01:31:57.245 --> 01:31:59.384
it'll take sunlight a month to reach you.

01:32:01.649 --> 01:32:03.151
It's wired.

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:07.629
If I don't make a phone call
every 24 hours, it's a goner.

01:32:10.158 --> 01:32:13.332
I told the committee
you'd do something like that.

01:32:13.395 --> 01:32:16.205
And I told you I want Sin Jin.

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:40.629
The President is very upset

01:32:40.955 --> 01:32:43.299
to say nothing of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

01:32:43.358 --> 01:32:44.803
the Secretary of Defense,

01:32:44.859 --> 01:32:47.965
the FBI, the National Security Council,

01:32:48.163 --> 01:32:50.507
hell, probably the Boy Scouts.

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:55.678
But the only one not upset is me.

01:32:59.074 --> 01:33:02.487
We built it, lost it, recovered it.

01:33:03.178 --> 01:33:05.920
Well, sort of. You were working for us.

01:33:06.381 --> 01:33:08.622
And now we've lost it again.

01:33:10.218 --> 01:33:11.959
Hell, even if you were to give it back,

01:33:12.020 --> 01:33:13.021
there's no way

01:33:13.088 --> 01:33:15.090
the President would ever let the Firm use it.

01:33:20.261 --> 01:33:22.207
I'm not giving it back.

01:33:25.266 --> 01:33:27.268
At least, not for this.

01:33:29.204 --> 01:33:30.444
I know.

01:33:31.673 --> 01:33:33.243
But, Hawke,

01:33:33.675 --> 01:33:35.780
as long as you've got Airwolf,

01:33:35.844 --> 01:33:37.346
Uncle Sam's minions

01:33:37.412 --> 01:33:39.016
have to keep looking for your brother.

01:33:39.080 --> 01:33:41.686
They also have to try to get it back from you.

01:33:41.850 --> 01:33:44.490
That's just the way the game's played.

01:33:47.856 --> 01:33:48.960
So?

01:33:49.591 --> 01:33:51.537
The Firm can help you,

01:33:51.693 --> 01:33:53.434
let you know what the other agencies

01:33:53.495 --> 01:33:54.701
are doing to entrap you,

01:33:54.762 --> 01:33:58.403
supply you with funds, lots of things.

01:33:58.833 --> 01:34:02.178
In exchange for using Airwolf
on official business.

01:34:05.039 --> 01:34:07.519
Well, it's the only way
we're gonna get to use it.

01:34:07.575 --> 01:34:10.715
And probably the only way
you won't get caught.

01:34:21.122 --> 01:34:22.829
Here's your ride.

01:34:26.494 --> 01:34:27.495
I always said

01:34:27.562 --> 01:34:30.042
you had better ears than a snooper mike.

01:34:31.566 --> 01:34:32.567
Well,

01:34:33.935 --> 01:34:35.505
think about it.

01:34:41.709 --> 01:34:43.586
Then give me a call.

01:34:53.755 --> 01:34:55.530
Did she suffer?

01:35:02.330 --> 01:35:03.638
What difference does it make?

01:35:03.698 --> 01:35:04.676
Damn it!

01:35:04.732 --> 01:35:06.541
I sent her out there, I want to know.

01:35:10.138 --> 01:35:11.310
No.

01:35:15.577 --> 01:35:17.557
No, she didn't suffer.

01:35:19.047 --> 01:35:20.856
Thank God for that.
