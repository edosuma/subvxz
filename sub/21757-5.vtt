08:49.600 --> 08:51.433
- Wow.
You have everything.

08:51.433 --> 08:52.567
I guess you are a chef.

08:52.567 --> 08:54.033
He packed a picnic.

08:54.033 --> 08:57.000
He arranged for a boat
to pick us up.

08:57.033 --> 08:58.567
It's a good start.

08:58.567 --> 09:01.600
- I consider myself very lucky
to be here with you.

09:01.600 --> 09:03.567
I don't--oh, really?

09:03.600 --> 09:05.066
- Yes, of course.

09:05.100 --> 09:07.600
- I don't take this
for granted whatsoever.

09:07.633 --> 09:10.066
- You want more?
- Yeah, f---ing please.

09:10.066 --> 09:12.333
Do I want more?
[laughs]

09:12.333 --> 09:14.066
These are awesome.

09:21.734 --> 09:26.133
This is a representation of us.

09:26.166 --> 09:27.600
It's called "Brianna Statue."

09:31.567 --> 09:33.066
- You move really fast.

09:33.100 --> 09:35.333
Whoa.
Uh, too soo--

09:35.333 --> 09:36.433
Too soon.

09:36.467 --> 09:37.667
- Moving in a van really fast

09:37.700 --> 09:39.066
or moving you and I
very fast?

09:39.066 --> 09:40.467
- Like verbally,
what you're saying.

09:40.500 --> 09:42.500
- Anyways,
can I take my shirt off?

09:42.500 --> 09:44.000
- Why not?

09:45.500 --> 09:47.433
- I want to be them.
They're, like, happy.

09:47.467 --> 09:48.667
- Yeah.

09:51.734 --> 09:52.767
- I understand.

09:52.767 --> 09:53.767
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah.

09:54.000 --> 09:55.066
- They're not restricted.

09:55.100 --> 09:56.500
If I can hang out naked,

09:56.500 --> 09:58.033
I mean,
'cause it's a nude beach--

09:59.533 --> 10:01.000
- I know.
I can.

10:03.600 --> 10:05.533
Oh, my gosh.

10:08.133 --> 10:11.600
- Did you ever think about
how much we have in common?

10:11.633 --> 10:13.033
- Um...

10:13.066 --> 10:14.100
Oh, God.

10:14.100 --> 10:15.433
- Coming up...

10:15.467 --> 10:17.100
- Are you a new crew
or something?

10:17.100 --> 10:18.367
- Yes, I am.

10:18.400 --> 10:19.600
- A new crewmember
has arrived.

10:19.633 --> 10:21.100
- What?

10:27.133 --> 10:27.533
- Did you ever think about

10:27.533 --> 10:28.133
- Did you ever think about
how much we have in common?

10:30.000 --> 10:31.633
- Oh, God.
- Listen to me.

10:31.667 --> 10:33.200
- I really appreciate this.

10:33.233 --> 10:34.667
Yeah, it's amazing.

10:34.667 --> 10:36.600
- This is cool.
- Mm-hmm.

10:36.633 --> 10:40.533
I don't want to make things
awkward.

10:43.700 --> 10:45.734
- I'm just gonna murder
"Brianna Statue."

10:45.767 --> 10:47.200
- Oh, please don't destroy it.

10:47.233 --> 10:50.533
Someone did it,
and it's kind of cute.

10:50.533 --> 10:53.467
- I'm hot.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.500
- This guy's obviously drunk.

10:55.533 --> 10:58.100
It's probably
the most awkward date

10:58.133 --> 10:59.767
I've ever been on.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.734
How you feeling?

11:01.767 --> 11:04.133
Are you full?

11:05.567 --> 11:07.433
So this is a horrible date?

11:07.433 --> 11:08.567
- Yeah.

11:08.567 --> 11:09.567
- You're calling me
an asshole?

11:09.567 --> 11:11.266
- Uh-huh.
- Um...

11:11.300 --> 11:13.033
Okay, Matt,
you really like me?

11:13.033 --> 11:15.133
- Yeah.
- Okay.

11:15.166 --> 11:16.567
- I do.
- I know.

11:16.567 --> 11:17.567
- I think there's a lot
in common.

11:17.567 --> 11:19.166
Put this in perspective.

11:19.166 --> 11:21.433
You and I fall
crazy in love with each other...

11:21.433 --> 11:22.500
- Why?

11:22.533 --> 11:25.166
- And get a f---ing hut.

11:25.166 --> 11:26.567
But then we're like,
"Oh, my God.

11:26.600 --> 11:27.567
What are we doing?"

11:27.600 --> 11:28.667
- Okay.

11:28.700 --> 11:30.700
Thank you.
It was nice.

11:30.734 --> 11:32.633
- This was nice.
- Very nice.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.000
- There are three people
on this date,

11:34.033 --> 11:35.433
and that's the problem.

11:35.467 --> 11:37.233
We have me, Bri,
and Jack Daniels.

11:37.266 --> 11:39.233
Dollar dollar bills, y'all!

11:39.266 --> 11:40.500

11:40.533 --> 11:42.033
And Jack Daniels is actually

11:42.033 --> 11:44.133
probably the loudest speaker
on the date.

11:44.166 --> 11:46.300
Oh, I never asked you
the same question.

11:47.333 --> 11:49.066
- Now?
Currently?

11:49.100 --> 11:52.133
No, I don't see anything
romantically right now.

11:52.166 --> 11:53.700
- Good.

11:55.300 --> 11:57.533
- Want to go to the bitch later?

11:57.567 --> 12:01.066
- I know the difference
between a, you know, bitch

12:01.100 --> 12:03.200
and then the bee-yatch.

12:03.200 --> 12:04.600
- [laughs]

12:04.633 --> 12:06.266
- Deck crew,
let's put everything away,

12:06.300 --> 12:08.266
do a deck check,
and be done working.

12:10.100 --> 12:11.734

You have to smell this.

12:13.100 --> 12:15.066
- I can't smell.

12:15.066 --> 12:16.600

12:16.600 --> 12:17.600
- I don't care.
I can't smell.

12:17.600 --> 12:18.600

is gonna be

16:02.266 --> 16:03.767
- Yeah, that's what he said.

16:05.266 --> 16:09.000
Guess that's what
"reconfiguration" meant.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.266
- He's all right?

16:10.266 --> 16:11.400

a lot of pressure

16:11.400 --> 16:12.667

in shape,

16:12.667 --> 16:14.000

16:28.400 --> 16:30.467
- This is your new boatswain.

16:30.500 --> 16:32.467
- Called me out
just for a little help.

16:32.500 --> 16:34.200
- No f---ing way.

- You know, get some things
straightened out.

to work out

that he has a bunk.

16:42.033 --> 16:43.266
- Absolutely.

- So if you want to show him
around the boat,

16:45.033 --> 16:46.433
get him settled in.

16:46.433 --> 16:48.233
- I'm pissed.

16:48.266 --> 16:49.300
I definitely feel like
I should be the boatswain

16:49.300 --> 16:50.300
and I deserve it.

16:50.300 --> 16:52.033
It, quite frankly, sucks.

We'll just go through
the whole process here.

- Just tired.
- Yeah, I hear you.

17:04.734 --> 17:07.367
- Do you need one?
- I just chugged one.

17:07.400 --> 17:09.133
- You just chugged a coffee?

17:09.166 --> 17:11.166
- Yup.
- I have not had one.

and a bunch of regrets.

Partying and drinking

17:24.200 --> 17:26.033
really hasn't done me
any favors.

17:26.066 --> 17:28.333
It actually kind of ruined
my relationship with my ex.

17:28.333 --> 17:30.200
I partied a lot,
and she didn't like it.

17:30.200 --> 17:31.734
But at the time,

17:31.767 --> 17:33.500
it was something
I wasn't ready to give up.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.266
- Hey, guys,
this is our new boatswain.

17:37.300 --> 17:38.734
- How you doing, man?
EJ.

17:38.734 --> 17:40.033
Nice to meet you, man.

17:40.066 --> 17:41.567
- Bruno.
- How you doing, Bruno?

17:41.600 --> 17:44.266
Coming in as the new guy
can be really difficult,

17:44.300 --> 17:46.333
but I'm always up
for a challenge.

17:46.333 --> 17:49.266
I would say
that in my whole entire life,

17:49.300 --> 17:51.734
from going to countless
different schools,

17:51.767 --> 17:54.000
from going
to countless different cities,

17:54.033 --> 17:56.467
I can adapt to a situation
very easily.

17:56.467 --> 17:57.734
It kind of gives me
a little thrill,

17:57.734 --> 17:59.200
a little adrenaline rush.

17:59.200 --> 18:00.433
- So, yeah, he's here

18:00.467 --> 18:02.333
to kind of get us
where we need to be.

18:02.367 --> 18:06.300
You know, obviously,
too many f---ups,

18:06.333 --> 18:09.100
so he's here to help
all of us out, so...

18:09.100 --> 18:12.033
- I answer to one higher power,
and that's God.

18:12.066 --> 18:13.200
I don't know who my boss is.

18:13.233 --> 18:14.367
This boat is ridiculous.

18:14.367 --> 18:15.567
Is one of us going?

18:15.600 --> 18:16.767
- Let's just have
a good charter,

18:17.000 --> 18:20.066
and hopefully
nobody is going.

18:20.100 --> 18:23.233
The guests are on at 12:30,
so let's finish the wipe-down.

18:23.233 --> 18:24.767
- Roger that.
- Yeah, mon.

18:24.767 --> 18:27.233
- Welcome aboard, EJ.
- Thank you, buddy.

18:27.233 --> 18:29.600
- I'm happy to have you.
- Cool beans, man.

18:31.600 --> 18:33.233
- Matt, this is our boatswain.

18:33.233 --> 18:34.333
- Hey, man, how you doing?

18:34.367 --> 18:35.367
- Nice to meet you.
- EJ.

18:35.367 --> 18:37.367
- This is our new boatswain.

18:37.367 --> 18:40.100
- Hi.
- Hello, hello.

18:40.100 --> 18:42.000
How are you?
- I'm good. How are you?

18:42.000 --> 18:44.133
- Pretty good.
- So where's he gonna sleep?

18:44.166 --> 18:46.266
- I have Chris in here.
- [laughs]

18:46.300 --> 18:48.200
- He can take his bunk.
- Oh!

18:48.233 --> 18:50.133
I don't spend that much time
in the crew mess,

18:50.133 --> 18:51.633
so I don't really care.

18:51.667 --> 18:54.266
Luckily, there's no HR
on a yacht.

18:54.266 --> 18:57.633
If there was,
we'd be in big trouble.

18:57.667 --> 18:59.233
- This is our boatswain.
- Hi.

18:59.266 --> 19:01.233
- Hello.
- Jen. Nice to meet you.

19:01.266 --> 19:02.400
- I know we're busy right now,

19:02.433 --> 19:03.600
but maybe change over
the sheets.

19:03.633 --> 19:04.533
- Right here?
- Yeah.

19:04.567 --> 19:06.066
- No problemo.

19:06.100 --> 19:08.133
- EJ is his name?
- Yeah.

19:08.133 --> 19:11.467
- So he's Nico's boss.
- Yeah.

19:11.500 --> 19:13.266
- Wow.

19:13.266 --> 19:16.266
- I figured we would hopefully
be hiring somebody new,

19:16.266 --> 19:18.533
but Captain Lee surprised
all of us.

19:18.533 --> 19:21.000
I don't know how
we're gonna work this out.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.000
- [sighs]

19:23.000 --> 19:24.433
- Now I've got two bosses,

19:24.433 --> 19:26.300
so, like, who do we
take orders from?

19:26.300 --> 19:28.500
- I don't know.
This is just too weird.

19:28.533 --> 19:30.300
- Coming up...

19:30.300 --> 19:31.500
- Stern's not clear.
We got one line still.

19:31.533 --> 19:32.500
- Come on, guys.

19:32.533 --> 19:34.133
There's a reason

19:34.166 --> 19:35.166
that Captain Lee called me
onto the boat.

19:35.166 --> 19:36.166
- We need to get that off.

19:36.200 --> 19:38.100
- Jesus Christ.

19:41.433 --> 19:41.567
- Hi.

19:41.567 --> 19:41.700
- Hi.
- Hey.

19:44.033 --> 19:45.400
- I don't know if you guys
have heard what's going on.

19:45.433 --> 19:46.433
- Well, I know we have
a new boatswain.

19:46.467 --> 19:48.300
- Yeah, I have a new roommate.

19:48.300 --> 19:49.567
And apparently you're sleeping
in the crew mess?

19:49.600 --> 19:51.166
I don't know if I'm okay--

19:51.166 --> 19:52.266
- You're sleeping
in the crew mess?

19:52.300 --> 19:53.567
- No, you are.
- I am?

19:53.567 --> 19:55.266
- Yeah.
- Well, of course.

19:55.300 --> 19:56.567
I'm not surprised.

19:56.567 --> 19:59.033
I do well with no sleep.
This is ideal for me.

19:59.033 --> 20:00.100
Are you kidding me?

20:00.133 --> 20:01.166
Captain and Nico,

20:01.166 --> 20:02.300
they're just trying

20:02.300 --> 20:03.433
to f--- with me
at this point.

20:03.467 --> 20:05.133
If you don't want me, tell me.

20:05.166 --> 20:06.467
But nobody wants
to make the call.

20:06.467 --> 20:08.200
Should have stayed in bed.

20:08.233 --> 20:10.467
- What's the task at hand
going on right now?

20:10.467 --> 20:12.200
They're just kind of
chamoising out, getting--

20:12.233 --> 20:13.700
- Yeah, and making
final details,

20:13.734 --> 20:15.266
making everything look good.

20:15.300 --> 20:16.433
- 30 minutes to showtime, kids.

20:16.467 --> 20:18.166
30 minutes to showtime.

20:23.467 --> 20:25.567
- Dude, don't even
get me started about it.

20:25.600 --> 20:27.166
- Hello.
- Brianna.

20:27.200 --> 20:28.600
- My name's EJ.
- Nice to meet you.

20:28.600 --> 20:29.600
I'm right across from you.

20:29.633 --> 20:31.734
- I live amongst the people now,

20:31.734 --> 20:33.300
in the common area.

20:33.333 --> 20:35.467
I'm back to being
a common man.

20:35.467 --> 20:37.567
So it looks like a great place
for everything I own.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.567
I don't know what I'm doing
with my life.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.200
- Everybody on the aft deck.

20:41.200 --> 20:42.567
Everybody on the aft deck now.

20:42.600 --> 20:44.066
- I don't give a sh--

20:44.100 --> 20:45.300
who he's hired on
as boatswain.

20:45.333 --> 20:46.567
I'm gonna make sure
that he knows

20:46.600 --> 20:48.734
where I stand
and where my place is.

20:48.767 --> 20:50.367
- I just feel like
it's gonna be weird.

20:50.400 --> 20:52.200
- It's gonna be really weird.
It already is weird.

20:53.500 --> 20:55.233
- No alcohol.

20:55.233 --> 20:57.367
I have a very bad feeling
about this charter.

As soon as we get
everybody comfortable,

we'll get under way
and get the party started.

21:31.767 --> 21:33.667
Okay, well,
this is our main salon.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.000
- Beautiful.

21:35.000 --> 21:36.233
- First we're gonna go on down

21:36.266 --> 21:37.333
to Brad and Summer's room.

21:37.367 --> 21:39.266
This your master stateroom,

21:39.266 --> 21:41.233
and you've got
a huge bathroom in here.

21:41.266 --> 21:43.000
Now, this toilet,
it's very fancy.

21:43.000 --> 21:44.734
It's motion-activated
to open.

21:44.767 --> 21:46.133
- Yeah.
[laughter]

21:46.166 --> 21:47.367
- I think the reason

21:47.400 --> 21:49.333
that people love this toilet
so much

21:49.367 --> 21:51.533
is just a perfect example

21:51.533 --> 21:55.767
of gratuitous, pointless,
money-spending luxury.

21:56.000 --> 21:57.333
- That means
you can't slam the lid.

21:57.367 --> 21:58.734
How great is that?
- That's right.

21:58.767 --> 22:00.667
- Let's get the shoes,
sync up the lines.

22:00.667 --> 22:03.667
You want to meet on the bow?
- Yeah.

22:03.700 --> 22:05.767
- Okay.
Do this bad boy.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.767
- If you want to be on the stern
with all these guys,

22:10.000 --> 22:11.000
I'm gonna take Bruno on the bow.

22:11.033 --> 22:12.300
- All right, buddy.

22:14.700 --> 22:16.700
Oh, my God.

huh?

22:23.567 --> 22:24.767
- Absolutely.

22:25.000 --> 22:26.166
- We're foodies.
We travel a lot.

22:26.166 --> 22:27.533
So food is really an experience,

22:27.567 --> 22:28.700
and it's about
what's available for us

22:28.700 --> 22:30.300
and the people
that are involved

22:30.333 --> 22:32.533
more than, "Hey,
let's execute something

22:32.567 --> 22:33.700
that's architecturally bizarre."

22:33.734 --> 22:35.433
I don't care about that.

22:35.433 --> 22:36.667
- I'm not a fancy man.
I'm very simple.

22:36.700 --> 22:38.233
Cool.

22:38.266 --> 22:39.567
Anyway, well, nice to meet you.
Thank you.

22:39.600 --> 22:41.533

one, two, three.

22:43.567 --> 22:46.400
Kind of going this way.
- Yeah, bow to stern.

22:46.433 --> 22:48.700
So I'm gonna walk it out

- All right.

23:03.633 --> 23:05.433
- No.
Sh--.

- Take the lines up.

Come on.

23:29.333 --> 23:30.734

what is the plan for EJ?

23:49.467 --> 23:50.500
How long is he working?

23:50.500 --> 23:51.500
- Is it EJ or AJ?

23:51.533 --> 23:52.767
Or what is his f---ing name?

23:52.767 --> 23:55.367
- Ejaculating Juicebag?

23:55.367 --> 23:56.633
- Yeah, that's
what he looks like.

23:56.633 --> 23:59.233
- Oh, yi, yi.

I could do it.

All right?

24:05.233 --> 24:06.600
- Good.
- You know what would be great?

24:06.633 --> 24:07.767
Like, a virgin lime colada.
- Got it.

24:07.767 --> 24:10.066
- I love that.
- Thank you.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.767

blended drinks

I don't get

You're welcome.

24:35.400 --> 24:40.000
- How are you feeling
about all the "excursion"?

24:40.033 --> 24:42.533
Like, are you quiet
because of that at all?

24:42.533 --> 24:44.266
- No.
- No?

24:44.300 --> 24:45.667
- I was just worried, like,
if you were feeling

24:45.667 --> 24:47.767
some kind of way this morning
because of it.

24:48.000 --> 24:49.333
- Oh, yeah.
No, I'm just tired.

24:49.367 --> 24:51.400
I'm just exhausted.
- Okay.

24:51.400 --> 24:54.533

I don't know.

34:28.333 --> 34:30.567
take a big line,
and I can spin my arm around it.

34:30.600 --> 34:32.133
- That's pretty cool, though.

34:32.166 --> 34:33.467
- I'm trying to build the team

34:33.500 --> 34:35.400
into being better yachties.

34:35.433 --> 34:36.600
In the end of the day,

34:36.600 --> 34:38.133
it's what they deserve.

34:38.166 --> 34:40.066
- Got to get that teak
on fleek, girl.

34:40.066 --> 34:42.233
- We run a friggin' tight ship
around here.

34:42.266 --> 34:44.367
- All right, people.
- I'm going to bed, I think.

34:44.367 --> 34:47.300
- Day one complete.

34:47.333 --> 34:51.100
- At dinner,
primary basically says

34:51.133 --> 34:52.200
the Bananas Foster
could have used

34:52.233 --> 34:53.767
a little bit more ice cream.

34:54.000 --> 34:56.333
- Maybe our chef will be
like the fireworks,

34:56.367 --> 35:01.333
like a very worrisome beginning
with a grand finale.

35:06.667 --> 35:07.100
- Do you want me

35:07.100 --> 35:07.433
- Do you want me
to go down after this?

35:08.533 --> 35:10.200
- Yes, I do.
Here.

35:10.233 --> 35:12.233
You're early girl tomorrow.

35:12.233 --> 35:13.467
- Good night.

35:13.500 --> 35:16.233
- So what do you think
of new guy EJ?

35:16.233 --> 35:19.300
- [sighs] Well, he seems like
he knows what he's doing.

35:19.333 --> 35:20.500
- And it's weird,
'cause he's, like,

35:20.500 --> 35:22.233
in charge of Nico now.

35:22.233 --> 35:25.000
Meanwhile, Chris is
sleeping on the couch.

35:25.033 --> 35:26.266
It's a weird situation.

35:26.300 --> 35:27.533
- Yeah, it's really weird.

35:27.533 --> 35:29.000
- EJ, Lee.

35:29.000 --> 35:30.400
- Go ahead, Lee.

35:30.433 --> 35:32.100
- Can I get you
up on the wheelhouse again?

35:35.400 --> 35:38.266
- Hey.

35:38.300 --> 35:40.533
What are your first impressions
of the crew?

35:40.533 --> 35:42.633
- I'd prefer to run it
a little harder,

35:42.667 --> 35:44.233
like just be
a little more stringent

35:44.266 --> 35:46.000
on the tasks to be done.

35:46.033 --> 35:48.066
- I'm going to bed.
I'm on release tomorrow.

35:48.100 --> 35:50.266
- We're having the crew just
walking around aimlessly.

35:50.266 --> 35:51.533
- Mm-hmm.

35:51.567 --> 35:53.266
- Nico has already set
the tone to the boat

35:53.300 --> 35:55.233
being kind of lazy-daisical.

35:55.266 --> 35:57.467
There's so much more potential,
and what we need

35:57.500 --> 36:00.200
is people coming together
and getting the stuff done.

36:00.233 --> 36:02.367
Just kind of get on the page
with Nico,

36:02.400 --> 36:04.266
'cause Nico and me
got to be...

36:04.266 --> 36:05.500
[clicking tongue]

36:05.533 --> 36:07.533
- I agree.

36:15.200 --> 36:22.266
♪ ♪

36:33.567 --> 36:36.300
- I could not,
for the life of me,

36:36.300 --> 36:37.500
sleep in the crew mess.

36:37.533 --> 36:39.166
It's way too loud.

36:39.166 --> 36:40.667
There's no privacy.
It's bright.

36:46.300 --> 36:50.166
- So I'm pretty miserable,
and it sucks.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.667
- Good morning.
How are you?

37:02.700 --> 37:05.333
What can I help you with?
A coffee or a--

37:05.367 --> 37:07.200
- I'm good
with just coffee.

37:07.200 --> 37:08.600
- Okay, cool.

37:08.600 --> 37:10.567
Jen, Jen, Matt.

37:10.600 --> 37:13.333

Ah.
Sh--.

37:29.233 --> 37:32.367
- I mean, kind of.
- Which one?

37:33.467 --> 37:34.500
- Hey, Matt, just let me know

37:34.533 --> 37:35.567
if you need me to come up.

37:35.600 --> 37:36.567
- I think she's here.

37:36.600 --> 37:39.200
Is that Jen?

37:40.367 --> 37:41.633
- Hi.
- They already up?

37:41.667 --> 37:43.200
- Yeah.
- Okay, I'm coming.

37:43.233 --> 37:44.467
- I already got his coffee
for him.

37:44.500 --> 37:46.233
- Okay, I'm coming.
Thank you.

37:46.233 --> 37:47.567
- How are you late for work
on a yacht?

37:47.600 --> 37:49.300
You have no commute.

37:49.333 --> 37:51.166
You roll out of bed;
you're there.

37:51.200 --> 37:52.600
At least I do.

37:52.633 --> 37:54.533
- How do you take your coffee?

37:55.600 --> 37:56.633
- That's it?
- Yeah.

37:56.633 --> 37:58.200
- Okay.

38:01.633 --> 38:04.233
- Hi.
Sorry for that.

38:04.233 --> 38:05.500
- I just gave him a coffee.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.633
- Everyone has already had
coffee?

38:07.633 --> 38:09.233
- No, just him.

38:09.266 --> 38:10.633
He's the only one
that's up.

38:10.667 --> 38:12.367
- Okay, thank you.

38:22.000 --> 38:25.266
- Whoa!
Holy sh--, buddy.

38:25.266 --> 38:28.600
I think you purposely
wanted me to see that.

38:28.633 --> 38:31.533
- How far are we going?

38:31.533 --> 38:34.667
- We're gonna head over
to Rendezvous Bay in Anguilla.

38:34.700 --> 38:36.767
- Cool.
- How you doing so far?

38:37.000 --> 38:38.400
EJ helping out?

38:38.433 --> 38:40.400
- Yeah, yeah, I mean, it's--

38:40.400 --> 38:42.400
I was gonna ask you as well,

38:42.400 --> 38:45.400
like, is that something
that's, like, permanent or...

38:45.433 --> 38:47.367
- I'm not sure.

38:50.367 --> 38:52.700
- Yeah?
I mean, 'cause--

38:52.700 --> 38:54.533
- Unless you're seeing
something that I'm missing.

38:54.567 --> 38:57.033
- I mean, if we have
an extra crew member

38:57.033 --> 38:58.700
and then we're sharing a tip,
you know,

38:58.700 --> 39:00.667
I just feel like there's
just too many people here.

39:02.467 --> 39:03.500
- I don't know.

39:03.533 --> 39:05.300
I didn't bring EJ in

39:05.333 --> 39:06.633
for my health.

39:06.667 --> 39:08.166
I brought him in
because we have a job to do.

39:08.166 --> 39:09.633
Nico needs to understand that.

39:09.667 --> 39:12.400
Suck it up, cupcake.

39:12.433 --> 39:14.300
- The guests are in the back.

39:14.333 --> 39:15.433
They're enjoying themself.

39:15.433 --> 39:16.567
We don't really want
to be seen.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.300
Home boy's doing the windows.

39:18.300 --> 39:20.667
I got Buddy on the back
doing a little waxing.

39:20.700 --> 39:22.233
Can you just start piecing away

39:22.266 --> 39:23.700
on things that we got
around boat?

39:23.700 --> 39:25.533
You know, like inside
those little crevices there,

39:25.567 --> 39:27.266
you could put some Whink.

39:27.300 --> 39:28.700
You know what Whink is?
The rust stain remover?

39:28.700 --> 39:29.767
- Yes.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.300
- My father was in the navy,

39:31.300 --> 39:32.567
so from a young age,

39:32.600 --> 39:34.033
hard work was instilled in me.

39:34.066 --> 39:35.467
And I've always believed

39:35.467 --> 39:37.200
that if you do your job
and you work hard,

39:37.233 --> 39:38.533
you're gonna come out on top.

39:38.567 --> 39:40.200
- All right,
I'm gonna get some Whink.

39:40.200 --> 39:42.300
- Yeah, get some Whink.

39:44.700 --> 39:46.667
- Did you get some rest?

39:46.700 --> 39:48.200
- I did.
Thank you.

39:48.200 --> 39:49.533
- Good.

39:55.367 --> 39:57.467
- Is he being as, like,
standoffish with you

39:57.467 --> 39:59.066
as he is with me?

39:59.066 --> 40:01.066
- Yeah, I think he's
feeling down or something.

40:01.066 --> 40:04.467
- For two days?
Just saying.

40:04.467 --> 40:06.500
- We'll see how today goes.

40:07.467 --> 40:09.200
- Coming up...

40:09.233 --> 40:10.734
- This brake wasn't disengaged.

40:10.734 --> 40:12.467
That's why it was so hard
to pull up.

40:12.467 --> 40:14.600
Oh, sh--.
- That's all metal,

40:14.633 --> 40:15.633
which isn't good for it.

40:15.667 --> 40:16.767
Strike one.

40:16.767 --> 40:18.567
What a f---ing idiot.

40:22.500 --> 40:22.734
[upbeat music]

40:24.600 --> 40:26.600
- All right, guys.
- I'd start pulling.

40:26.633 --> 40:28.333
- All ready here.
- Copy that.

40:28.367 --> 40:30.367
We're gonna get out of here.

40:38.367 --> 40:40.767
- Ah, f---.

40:40.767 --> 40:42.767
Got to be careful
with that paint, though.

40:42.767 --> 40:46.367
- The chain's scraping
the bottom bank.

40:46.400 --> 40:48.166
Have you not picked up
an anchor before?

40:48.200 --> 40:49.467
- There we go.

40:56.600 --> 40:57.667
- Good morning, my friends.

40:57.667 --> 40:59.100
- It looks beautiful.

41:01.000 --> 41:02.500
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

41:02.533 --> 41:04.133
- Breakfast is served.

41:04.166 --> 41:06.133
- Really good.

41:06.133 --> 41:08.133
- So, Matt, how's life?

41:08.166 --> 41:11.000
- Good.
- Okay.

41:11.000 --> 41:12.533
- The last couple of days
really put perspective

41:12.533 --> 41:14.400
of how much I need

41:14.433 --> 41:15.600
to get it together.

41:18.133 --> 41:20.400
Do you know who I am?
[giggles]

41:20.400 --> 41:21.533
- Is he wasted again?

41:21.567 --> 41:22.667
- It's embarrassing.

41:22.700 --> 41:24.533
And it's not a great feeling

41:24.567 --> 41:26.000
having a charter guest
tell you you're sh--.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.633
- The risotto's underdone.

41:27.667 --> 41:29.500
- My steak is way past medium.

41:29.533 --> 41:31.133
- I had hardly any ice cream.

41:31.133 --> 41:32.533
- If you don't recognize
that you've messed up,

41:32.567 --> 41:33.667
you're gonna keep messing up.

41:33.667 --> 41:36.533
So I got to get my act together.

41:44.033 --> 41:46.233
- Anchor's in the pocket.

41:48.567 --> 41:51.033
- This brake wasn't disengaged,
by the way.

41:51.033 --> 41:52.567
That's why it was so hard
to pull up.

41:52.600 --> 41:54.433
- Oh, sh--.

41:54.467 --> 41:56.166
- See all this in here?

41:56.200 --> 41:58.166
That's all the metal
rubbing up against each other.

41:58.200 --> 42:00.233
- With Nico, I feel that maybe

42:00.266 --> 42:01.633
he wants me to f--- up

42:01.667 --> 42:03.700
so it looks good on him.

42:03.700 --> 42:06.567
Buddy, you got
a whole other think coming.

42:06.600 --> 42:09.533
- A lot of friction,
which isn't good for it.

42:09.567 --> 42:10.667
- Jesus, dude.

42:10.700 --> 42:12.567
- Oh, my God.

42:12.600 --> 42:14.000
You're the boatswain,
and you don't know

42:14.033 --> 42:15.166
how to take
a hand brake off?

42:15.166 --> 42:17.700
Dude, you got to go.
Strike one.

42:17.734 --> 42:21.100
What a f---ing idiot.

42:22.600 --> 42:24.734
- Next on "Below Deck"...
- Oh, sh--.

42:24.767 --> 42:26.734
- We got a little leakage
in the laundry room, girls.

42:26.734 --> 42:29.133
- Uh...

42:29.166 --> 42:31.533
- How much soap
did you put in the washers?

42:31.567 --> 42:33.200
- Move it. Move it. Move it.

42:33.200 --> 42:36.066
- We are drifting
into the "Maltese Falcon."

42:36.066 --> 42:37.734
- Go the other way!
- Son of a bitch.

42:37.734 --> 42:39.734
- Brace yourself.
[thud]

42:39.734 --> 42:41.200
- You're quite bitter
all the time.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.467
- I have nothing
to be bitter about.

42:42.467 --> 42:43.467
- Listen to me
right now, Jen.

42:43.467 --> 42:45.066
You need to take it down.

42:45.066 --> 42:46.734
- I don't ever want
to talk to Bri again.

42:46.734 --> 42:48.166
- Take it off.

42:48.200 --> 42:49.734
What the f---
is wrong with you?

42:49.734 --> 42:51.600
I just want to wring him
by the neck.

42:51.600 --> 42:53.033
It's my deck now, buddy boy.

42:53.066 --> 42:54.066
- You want to play?

42:54.066 --> 42:55.734
- That's f---ing embarrassing.

42:55.734 --> 42:57.467
When the pressure comes on,

42:57.467 --> 42:59.734
everything you learned
just gets forgotten.

42:59.767 --> 43:02.166
I'm gonna have
to cut you loose.

43:02.200 --> 43:04.767
- For more "Below Deck,"
to go:
