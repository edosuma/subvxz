00:38.472 --> 00:40.723
So, what's on your mind, Luke?

00:43.268 --> 00:44.477
Nothing.

00:47.898 --> 00:50.941
I mean, I can make something up.

00:51.026 --> 00:54.487
Fine. Make something up, then.

00:56.240 --> 00:57.365
Okay.

01:04.165 --> 01:08.877
- I'm having trouble getting laid.
- Common problem.

01:10.838 --> 01:14.674
- How old are you again, Luke?
- Old enough to be getting laid.

01:15.051 --> 01:19.179
- And getting older every day.
- Have you ever gotten laid?

01:20.223 --> 01:23.266
Two years ago,
I fucked Katie Randall in Battery Park.

01:24.727 --> 01:27.438
But she had drank like two 40-ounces,

01:28.065 --> 01:30.149
and the cops came and broke us up
before we...

01:30.234 --> 01:33.319
So, she was drunk?

01:34.696 --> 01:36.322
Home girl weighs, like, 60 pounds,

01:36.406 --> 01:39.909
and she drank
two 40-ounce bottles of Crazy Horse.

01:40.577 --> 01:43.704
- Crazy Horse?
- Look, Dr. Squires...

01:43.789 --> 01:46.040
- Call me Jeff.
- Look, Jeff...

01:47.459 --> 01:48.960
Dr. Squires...

01:51.380 --> 01:55.299
- How much do you need, man?
- You're the one who needs this, son.

01:55.384 --> 01:57.885
- How much?
- A quarter.

01:59.597 --> 02:03.100
Well, I can give you two eighths.
It's the same thing.

02:06.771 --> 02:09.106
- That entitles you to another...
- Forty-eight minutes.

02:09.190 --> 02:13.068
Forty-eight minutes.
If you go now, you're getting ripped off.

02:14.195 --> 02:17.739
I'm just not feeling
all this feeling shit today, Dr. Squires.

02:17.824 --> 02:22.035
Luke, tomorrow's a very big day in your life.
One of the biggest.

02:22.120 --> 02:27.249
And I look at you and there's...
There's just no joy, you know?

02:29.961 --> 02:32.297
Tell Stephanie I say what's up.

02:37.803 --> 02:40.638
Hey, you ever feel kind of like a fuck up?

02:42.808 --> 02:45.602
Buying weed from the same dude
that deals to your daughter?

02:45.686 --> 02:49.480
- Stepdaughter.
- Stepdaughter. Exactly.

02:50.941 --> 02:53.651
- Later, Mr. Squires.
- I'm a doctor, Luke.

02:54.153 --> 02:55.570
Dr. Squires.

03:03.830 --> 03:07.291
I met Dr. Squires in the spring of '94.

03:07.375 --> 03:10.377
First as a client, then as a patient.

03:10.462 --> 03:13.964
At the beginning we didn't
talk about much of anything.

03:14.049 --> 03:17.468
I don't know why I kept seeing him,
to be honest.

03:17.552 --> 03:20.387
But sometimes it's nice
to have someone to talk to.

03:20.472 --> 03:23.265
Even if you're just talking shit.

03:23.350 --> 03:28.729
He told me the drug thing was a cry for help.
Maybe he's right.

03:28.813 --> 03:32.316
I am Luke Shapiro. I'm a drug dealer.

03:32.859 --> 03:33.859
Hear my cry.

03:42.745 --> 03:47.540
My occupation takes me to exotic places
like Brooklyn and Queens.

03:49.210 --> 03:53.004
Now, I like it most in the summer
when no one's around. Just me,

03:53.214 --> 03:57.884
the sweaty girls in their short skirts
with their breasts and their panties,

03:58.427 --> 04:01.596
which I like to see when I can see them.

04:01.847 --> 04:07.018
I like fly ladies. I like tank tops.
I like short skirts.

04:07.103 --> 04:12.108
I like my impure thoughts,
which go a little something like this.

04:28.959 --> 04:30.584
Shapiro.

04:36.174 --> 04:39.093
- No, did you smell it?
- You're holding it, you smell it.

04:39.177 --> 04:41.930
Well, I'm not... Listen, Mr. Bigshot.
You know all about expiration dates?

04:42.015 --> 04:44.266
Just look at the jar
and tell me what you think.

04:44.350 --> 04:47.227
I don't know.
Why don't you check it out yourself?

05:00.575 --> 05:03.535
I hate high school so I'm alone a lot.

05:04.328 --> 05:08.707
Which is fine by me.
Sometimes it gets lonely, I guess.

05:10.251 --> 05:12.879
But I don't need high school friends.

05:12.963 --> 05:18.009
One week they're listening to Kris Kross,
the next, they're listening to Pearl Jam.

05:18.218 --> 05:21.220
I'm not like that. I'm loyal.

05:22.306 --> 05:24.849
I mean, I still listen to cassettes.

05:27.603 --> 05:29.812
But tomorrow my life changes.

05:31.982 --> 05:33.816
Tomorrow I graduate.

05:36.737 --> 05:39.238
And then I go to my safety school.

05:40.657 --> 05:42.492
And then I get older.

05:43.494 --> 05:45.162
And then I die.

05:51.669 --> 05:53.378
Robert Samuels.

06:01.012 --> 06:02.596
Shana Sewart.

06:09.771 --> 06:11.522
Luke Shapiro.

06:22.076 --> 06:26.871
- Congratulations, Shapiros.
- Lucas, aren't you going to introduce us?

06:26.956 --> 06:30.875
- Mom, Dad, this is Mr... Dr. Squires.
- Jeff.

06:31.627 --> 06:34.546
- And this is my wife, Kristen.
- A pleasure.

06:35.256 --> 06:37.257
And here's your daughter.

06:43.806 --> 06:46.057
- Stepdaughter.
- Stephanie.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.894
All right, team. Picture time.

06:52.899 --> 06:55.901
Tuck the fucking shirt
into your pants, Jeffrey.

07:03.994 --> 07:06.120
- Hello. You paged me?
- Yeah.

07:13.587 --> 07:15.504
Yo, I didn't know there was
a party tonight, son.

07:15.589 --> 07:18.215
Yeah. It's the graduation party.

07:18.300 --> 07:20.801
- I just graduated.
- Yeah. I know.

07:22.638 --> 07:26.099
Yo, could you spot me 26 bucks?

07:28.352 --> 07:31.771
- Take the shit, yeah.
- Good looking out.

07:31.856 --> 07:34.900
- I don't want your fucking $4.
- All right.

07:37.737 --> 07:40.947
Shapiro, you always come through
with the madness.

07:41.824 --> 07:45.535
This is gonna last us
till that first weekend in Amsterdam.

07:45.620 --> 07:49.122
- You're going to Amsterdam?
- Yeah, man. I told you that.

07:49.498 --> 07:51.917
All right, man. Have a good summer then.

07:52.001 --> 07:55.296
Yeah, I gotta bounce.
They're almost out of Zima.

07:58.467 --> 08:00.635
- Yo.
- Shapiro?

08:00.719 --> 08:03.971
Hey, Steph. What up?

08:04.056 --> 08:05.264
Hey.

08:08.518 --> 08:12.188
- You want some Ritalin?
- No, no. I'm cool.

08:20.155 --> 08:22.657
So, what are you up to this summer?

08:23.200 --> 08:28.330
Chilling. Making money. Why?
You wanna go steady?

08:29.207 --> 08:30.707
Yeah. Sure.

08:38.799 --> 08:43.553
- What are you doing for the summer?
- I'm interning for one of Daddy's patients.

08:44.347 --> 08:49.977
So, it's just gonna be like you and me
here all alone and all, all summer.

08:51.104 --> 08:53.146
But we'll never hang out.

10:04.180 --> 10:05.847
...what that is is a combination
of the temperature

10:05.931 --> 10:10.018
and the humidity, those two combined.
So it'll be about 100 degrees today,

10:10.102 --> 10:13.021
but it'll feel like 105 to 110,
and that's in the shade.

10:13.105 --> 10:15.648
If you're in the sun
that'll add about 10 to 5 degrees,

10:15.733 --> 10:18.777
5 to 10 degrees, more hotter that it will feel.

10:19.195 --> 10:21.237
No... I'll tell you that much 'cause I...

10:21.322 --> 10:23.114
He doesn't understand
the finer points about it...

10:23.199 --> 10:24.657
What he doesn't understand
is what I don't understand,

10:24.742 --> 10:27.410
which is I don't understand
what you're telling me half the time.

10:27.495 --> 10:29.204
Your father lost all of our money

10:29.288 --> 10:31.998
and now we have to move to,
well, I don't know, somewhere poor.

10:32.083 --> 10:34.168
- Oh, somewhere poor?
- We're moving?

10:34.252 --> 10:37.838
No, no, Luke, I'm telling you,
I promise you we are not getting evicted.

10:37.923 --> 10:40.841
- We're getting evicted?
- No, no. There's plenty of time. I'll fix it.

10:40.926 --> 10:41.926
Oh, yeah, plenty!

10:42.010 --> 10:44.178
What's wrong with your face?

10:45.097 --> 10:47.181
What's wrong with his face?

10:47.891 --> 10:49.433
Did you fucking scratch him?

10:49.518 --> 10:52.228
- He hit me!
- I did not hit you, you goddamn liar!

10:52.312 --> 10:54.772
She's a goddamn liar.
You never hit a woman, Luke.

10:54.856 --> 10:56.565
The two of you are acting like
you're fucking 12 years old.

10:56.650 --> 10:58.526
- Stop cursing.
- Fuck off!

10:58.610 --> 11:00.986
- You see where he gets that mouth?
- Great. "That mouth."

11:01.071 --> 11:04.782
- Thank you very much. Right.
- "That mouth" from your mother.

11:15.169 --> 11:18.004
Republican political consultants
differ on the extent

11:18.089 --> 11:20.757
to which Mayor Giuliani's support
of the President's crime bill

11:20.842 --> 11:23.093
could hurt him in the future.

11:24.137 --> 11:26.346
I can't take that from you.

11:31.436 --> 11:35.021
- Where are you going?
- Somebody's gotta work around here.

11:46.410 --> 11:50.329
Jesus, fellows.
A little dramatic, don't you think?

11:51.748 --> 11:53.916
Are you that Luke?

12:00.966 --> 12:02.258
Who is this?

12:02.342 --> 12:05.011
Dis are the new shit. Biggie.

12:07.973 --> 12:11.852
- This shit is dope.
- Dis cat gonna change your world.

12:21.905 --> 12:23.697
Everything cool, boy?

12:25.241 --> 12:30.412
- I could use a little more this week, Pers.
- How much more you want?

12:31.456 --> 12:36.335
- Like another five Zs.
- Oh, boy! You got big aspirations, Luke.

12:38.421 --> 12:40.339
No, just a lot of debt.

12:42.342 --> 12:43.843
Okay, soldier.

12:45.930 --> 12:47.639
Be careful out there.

12:47.723 --> 12:52.810
Dis blood clot Giuliani got dem bumba clot
police looking at everybody and everything.

12:52.895 --> 12:56.731
- Even white boy like you.
- I'm always careful, you know that.

12:56.941 --> 12:59.776
I know. Dat is why me like you.

13:00.945 --> 13:02.278
- Luke!
- Yo!

13:04.448 --> 13:06.616
It's called Ready to Die.

13:10.871 --> 13:14.624
I know, but tell me one thing,
we don't have any money?

13:57.795 --> 14:02.507
Dr. Squires, can you, like,
prescribe medicine and shit?

14:03.259 --> 14:04.593
Of course.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.512
Why do you ask, Luke?

14:08.014 --> 14:11.016
- Well, it's for me.
- No shit.

14:11.350 --> 14:14.144
I think recently I've been depressed.

14:16.147 --> 14:20.526
I don't sleep good. I think too much.

14:21.862 --> 14:26.991
Luke, you ever hear the saying,
"The unexamined life is not worth living"?

14:27.200 --> 14:32.997
- Yeah. Maybe the examined one isn't either.
- Oh, no, come on, don't talk like that.

14:35.709 --> 14:38.711
Has this got something to do
with Kurt Cobain?

14:40.213 --> 14:42.089
Look, the point is,

14:42.841 --> 14:45.718
who says it's gotta be all
so fucking sad like that, you know?

14:45.802 --> 14:49.805
Is there something going on at home, Luke?

14:50.098 --> 14:53.435
Yeah, of course
something's going on at home. What?

14:53.519 --> 14:55.729
This is what you get paid for?

14:56.689 --> 15:00.901
Men do the things they need to do
to become the men they want to be.

15:00.985 --> 15:03.612
- Do you understand?
- Sure.

15:04.072 --> 15:06.323
That includes asking for help.

15:10.453 --> 15:12.829
- It's my parents.
- There you go.

15:13.331 --> 15:14.956
What about them?

15:15.708 --> 15:17.167
They just...

15:18.461 --> 15:20.962
They act like kids, you know?

15:22.757 --> 15:26.678
My wife and I are the same way.
We act like kids all the time.

15:26.762 --> 15:28.554
And why do you think that is?

15:28.639 --> 15:31.265
Life

15:31.350 --> 15:32.934
has a

15:33.018 --> 15:37.105
funny way of turning you
into the one thing you don't wanna be.

15:38.273 --> 15:39.816
My life sucks.

15:41.944 --> 15:44.112
- I swear, it sucks.
- Lucas.

15:45.114 --> 15:49.200
Do you have any idea
what I would give to be you again?

15:49.284 --> 15:53.162
Not you, specifically, but me at your age?
It doesn't get any better.

15:53.247 --> 15:56.667
- Tell me that's not true.
- Oh, you're fucking living, Luke.

15:56.751 --> 16:00.921
It's great, living. Get your heart broken.
Find yourself face down in the gutter.

16:01.005 --> 16:03.716
Get your pulse up.
Make a real mess of your life, son.

16:03.800 --> 16:07.386
- This is what you tell all your patients?
- You're not depressed, Luke.

16:07.470 --> 16:10.931
- You're sad. There's a difference.
- No, I'm depressed.

16:11.516 --> 16:13.475
I'm mad depressed, yo.

16:14.394 --> 16:17.062
So just give me some of those happy pills
and we can call it a day.

16:17.147 --> 16:19.356
Sorry, Luke. I can't do that.

16:22.152 --> 16:27.030
- And how do you suggest I deal, then?
- I suggest you talk about it with a friend.

16:27.824 --> 16:32.120
- Like I said, I don't have any friends.
- You have me.

16:32.872 --> 16:34.205
Great.

16:43.507 --> 16:45.341
Yo, Shapiro.

16:46.635 --> 16:48.136
- Yo.
- What's up, man?

16:48.220 --> 16:49.804
Steph, what up?

16:50.389 --> 16:51.598
Who's this?

16:51.682 --> 16:55.477
This is Jesus Christ.
From my stepdad's first marriage.

16:55.561 --> 16:59.856
- Bet I can guess what you're doing here.
- Yeah, your stepdad paged me.

17:00.065 --> 17:03.194
Dude smokes more weed than I do,
it's pathetic.

17:04.237 --> 17:06.530
- You like him?
- Squires?

17:08.032 --> 17:09.407
Not really.

17:10.035 --> 17:11.618
But you should hear about
some of the crazy people

17:11.703 --> 17:13.662
that come into that guy's office.

17:13.747 --> 17:15.998
- He tells you about that shit?
- Yeah.

17:16.082 --> 17:18.959
But, I mean he's not, like,
supposed to tell you, right?

17:19.044 --> 17:23.464
- There's confidentiality and what not?
- Whatever. I don't know. He tells me anyway.

17:23.548 --> 17:28.051
Like there's this one guy he sees,
I'm not kidding, a chronic masturbator.

17:31.223 --> 17:33.683
- That's crazy.
- The guy jerks off seven times a day.

17:33.768 --> 17:35.310
Literally. And when his nuts are dry,

17:35.394 --> 17:37.354
he just lies in bed
with his hands down his pants,

17:37.438 --> 17:39.815
like, touching himself and shit.

17:39.899 --> 17:42.192
- Jesus Christ, no.
- Oh, it's all right. It's all good.

17:42.276 --> 17:44.402
- Sorry.
- Don't trip.

17:44.862 --> 17:47.155
Is this yours?

17:48.074 --> 17:49.366
Yeah.

17:49.450 --> 17:53.203
- This is my summer job.
- You sell ices?

17:54.413 --> 17:58.416
No, that's my cover. For my parents.

17:59.585 --> 18:01.086
Check me out.

18:06.426 --> 18:10.680
Shit! That's a lot of green, man.

18:10.764 --> 18:15.226
- That's how I roll.
- So, you just... How does it work?

18:15.936 --> 18:18.479
Well, I mean... Can I show you?

18:21.191 --> 18:23.901
Sure. Let me drop the dog off.

18:23.986 --> 18:26.654
- All right.
- All right. Hang on.

18:32.995 --> 18:35.621
I'm not going to get arrested, am I?

18:36.164 --> 18:40.502
Just act calm and follow my lead,
and everything will be fine.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.716
Relax. Here.

18:56.853 --> 19:00.022
- Luke.
- Yo. That's her.

19:00.106 --> 19:03.150
Hi, Luke. This is Albert.

19:04.319 --> 19:06.320
We just ate mushrooms.

19:08.948 --> 19:12.660
- So, how much do you all need again?
- We met at a Phish show.

19:13.495 --> 19:18.249
And we saw each other
and it was like that episode of 90210,

19:18.334 --> 19:21.836
when Brandon and Emily Valentine
take ecstasy.

19:21.921 --> 19:23.922
- Euphoria.
- What?

19:24.006 --> 19:25.423
It's called euphoria.

19:25.507 --> 19:27.884
Euphoria.

19:27.968 --> 19:31.137
Euphoria. Euphoria.

19:33.307 --> 19:36.601
- Did you do something with your hair?
- No.

19:37.102 --> 19:41.941
You look cuter.
You look like Jason Priestley like that.

19:42.275 --> 19:46.695
Yo. There's like mad cops around, I think.

19:47.322 --> 19:49.073
So, can we do this?

20:00.085 --> 20:03.337
Who? Who's the girl? Is she a cop?

20:03.421 --> 20:06.423
No, this is my friend Stephanie.

20:07.384 --> 20:11.136
- Stephanie, this is Elanor.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

20:11.930 --> 20:13.013
Hi.

20:14.850 --> 20:16.434
Come on in.

20:19.271 --> 20:20.647
She's hot.

20:22.024 --> 20:25.527
I'm sorry about the cop stuff. I just...

20:26.028 --> 20:30.615
You know, with Giuliani and the stories
you hear, you can't be too careful.

20:30.700 --> 20:33.284
So I had to do this today, though,

20:33.369 --> 20:35.870
because I have this guy
coming into town tomorrow

20:35.955 --> 20:39.833
and we don't have anything to talk about
unless we're stoned.

20:40.292 --> 20:43.086
But if we're stoned, in bed he's like...

20:44.005 --> 20:45.923
He's a really nice guy.

20:46.008 --> 20:49.010
Luke, can I ask you something?
Just for a sec.

20:49.094 --> 20:51.262
Why are men so complicated?

20:52.556 --> 20:54.181
Is it because I'm intimidating?

20:54.266 --> 20:57.351
Am I intimidating because
I play an instrument?

20:57.436 --> 20:58.436
No.

21:00.439 --> 21:02.523
- You play an instrument?
- No, I know.

21:02.607 --> 21:05.192
I forgot you don't know anything about me.

21:05.277 --> 21:09.196
I mean, I don't really need
to know anything about you, Elanor.

21:09.281 --> 21:13.451
I played in a band in the '80s.
Well, in '82 we were really big.

21:14.286 --> 21:16.871
What about you? Stephanie? Right?

21:16.955 --> 21:21.752
You must have some insight
into the mind of men.

21:21.836 --> 21:24.379
I mean, he must be a handful.

21:24.464 --> 21:27.674
- Oh, we're not that.
- We're not like that.

21:27.759 --> 21:31.511
I think you're really beautiful
and you have really good chemistry.

21:31.596 --> 21:35.682
Don't you think you should try it once
and just see how it feels?

21:38.603 --> 21:40.937
Elanor, you know,

21:41.022 --> 21:44.024
I could just sell you some weed
and we could leave it at that.

21:44.108 --> 21:48.487
Oh, yeah. Okay. A quarter of bubble gum?

21:51.784 --> 21:52.909
Yeah.

21:55.454 --> 21:56.704
All right. We're gonna...

21:56.789 --> 22:00.875
Yeah. And the door, when you
shut it, it just locks behind you.

22:02.753 --> 22:04.087
Thanks, you guys.

22:04.922 --> 22:08.883
Yo, Shapiro, you should take my number.
Okay. Call me some time.

22:10.302 --> 22:12.053
- Call you?
- Yeah.

22:14.389 --> 22:17.809
- You mean, like, for weed?
- No, man. To hang out.

22:19.144 --> 22:22.648
This city can get so lonely
when there's nobody to talk to.

22:22.732 --> 22:24.858
I think we could be friends.

22:25.193 --> 22:27.611
- Friends?
- Yeah, friends. You know, like,

22:27.695 --> 22:31.198
homies, buddies, amigos.
Just take my number, okay?

22:34.035 --> 22:36.870
All right, word. I'll definitely call you.

23:12.449 --> 23:14.951
What do you want from me, Luke?

23:16.912 --> 23:18.413
I don't know.

23:20.916 --> 23:24.669
Come on, Luke, you can tell me.

23:24.753 --> 23:27.339
After all, I'm just in your head.

23:27.424 --> 23:28.757
Be honest.

23:29.634 --> 23:32.553
Do you wanna do dirty things to me?

23:32.637 --> 23:35.139
Not, like, especially dirty.

23:35.223 --> 23:37.600
Just, like, normal dirty.

23:38.935 --> 23:42.938
Do you want to fuck me? On the beach?
In the sun?

23:45.692 --> 23:47.776
Do you wanna be my friend?

23:49.279 --> 23:53.115
- Do you wanna be my best friend?
- Maybe.

23:54.743 --> 23:58.412
Place your hand on my shoulder. It's warm.

24:00.958 --> 24:04.252
Put your hand between my thighs.

24:04.337 --> 24:07.297
Come to the sun, Luke. Come.

24:07.924 --> 24:09.633
- Come.
- I'm coming.

24:09.759 --> 24:10.759
Come.

24:13.012 --> 24:14.930
Fuck. Yo!

24:18.017 --> 24:19.809
What's up, Dad?

24:20.728 --> 24:24.147
What's a seven-letter word
for a subatomic particle?

24:25.316 --> 24:26.650
I don't know, Dad. What's up?

24:26.734 --> 24:28.401
Son, would you please turn down
the air conditioning?

24:28.486 --> 24:30.403
The electric bill is through the roof.

24:30.488 --> 24:33.783
- Dad, it's like 90 degrees out.
- Please, just do it.

25:00.018 --> 25:02.103
Such a beautiful evening.

25:04.607 --> 25:07.109
- What are you doing?
- Seating.

25:08.486 --> 25:12.447
- For that charity thing.
- Do you wanna go out?

25:15.034 --> 25:16.118
Out?

25:16.202 --> 25:20.205
You know, out. Grab a drink, chill.

25:21.165 --> 25:25.919
It's a Tuesday night. And I'm almost 40.

25:26.004 --> 25:27.963
Two. You're 42.

26:07.379 --> 26:11.383
I've been thinking about your dilemma
a lot recently, Luke.

26:12.927 --> 26:15.929
- What's my dilemma?
- The girl thing.

26:17.182 --> 26:21.643
Luke, back when I went to school,
drug dealers had no problem getting girls.

26:21.728 --> 26:24.730
In fact,
that's why I always wanted to be one.

26:24.814 --> 26:27.441
Were you popular in high school,
Dr. Squires?

26:27.525 --> 26:32.613
Well, I wouldn't say popular, no.

26:32.697 --> 26:35.991
I wasn't one of those cool kids,
if that's what you're asking.

26:36.076 --> 26:39.578
- I played baseball, I was a debater...
- Did you ever wanna kill yourself?

26:39.663 --> 26:44.084
- Not till much later.
- Then you must have been popular.

26:45.336 --> 26:46.378
I'm not.

26:46.462 --> 26:49.422
This has got
nothing to do with being popular, Luke.

26:49.507 --> 26:52.050
You're just not trying hard enough.

26:53.469 --> 26:56.930
You must think about it.
The different scenarios.

26:57.556 --> 27:01.726
Random sex in phone booths,
chance encounters in discos,

27:01.811 --> 27:06.648
the way they smell, the things they say,
even when they're saying nothing at all.

27:10.694 --> 27:12.071
I mean,

27:12.155 --> 27:16.409
I'm married,
so I don't contemplate that type of thing.

27:16.493 --> 27:18.828
No. Of course not.

27:22.374 --> 27:24.583
Surely there's someone, Luke.

27:27.170 --> 27:29.755
Yeah.

27:29.840 --> 27:31.507
This one girl.

27:31.591 --> 27:36.345
That's fantastic, Luke.
Who is she? Does Stephanie know her?

27:36.721 --> 27:38.597
No.

27:38.682 --> 27:42.643
No, she goes to school downtown.

27:44.147 --> 27:48.233
- So what's the problem?
- She just wants to be friends.

27:48.317 --> 27:51.445
- What makes you think that?
- She said so.

27:51.529 --> 27:55.323
Make her like you, Luke.
That's what I did with my wife.

27:55.408 --> 27:57.367
How did you do that?

27:58.077 --> 28:03.206
Be her friend. Confide in her, earn her trust.
Then, when you are least threatening to her,

28:03.291 --> 28:07.252
grab her and stick your tongue so far down
her throat she starts to gag from pleasure.

28:07.336 --> 28:10.297
- Can I grab her tits, too?
- Baby steps, Luke.

28:10.381 --> 28:11.548
Right.

28:12.383 --> 28:14.593
Pursue her, Luke.
You're the perfect age for it.

28:14.677 --> 28:18.181
You haven't yet been systematically numbed
to the allure of romance.

28:18.265 --> 28:22.226
- You still have your youthful...
- I got it.

28:23.187 --> 28:26.731
Young men need sex, Luke.
All men, actually.

28:28.734 --> 28:31.277
I can get you a hooker, if you like.

28:31.737 --> 28:36.908
- God, I was this close to respecting you.
- Big mistake, Luke. Call your girl.

28:39.286 --> 28:43.039
You don't need medication, Luke.
You just need to get laid.

28:45.834 --> 28:49.087
- It's a surprise attack. I don't want these...
- What is the postmark on that?

28:49.172 --> 28:52.257
- What do you mean? I just got it today.
- I just wanna know what the postmark is.

28:53.885 --> 28:56.094
- When did you get it?
- I don't wanna talk about the postmark!

29:12.111 --> 29:13.445
Oh, my God!

29:23.499 --> 29:24.791
Jeffrey!

29:28.963 --> 29:34.801
Hello?

29:37.137 --> 29:40.640
- I'm looking for...
- Luke?

29:42.309 --> 29:46.312
- Luke, is that you?
- Dr. Squires?

29:46.397 --> 29:49.315
It's okay, Luke. I know why you're calling.

29:50.693 --> 29:53.153
- You do?
- The beaver hunt.

29:55.365 --> 29:56.991
The pussy quest.

29:58.910 --> 30:01.328
I can help you, Luke. Let's grab a drink.

30:01.413 --> 30:03.414
I got just the place.

30:05.125 --> 30:06.166
All right.

30:13.341 --> 30:17.344
It's strange. This place used to be packed.

30:18.305 --> 30:21.515
The city's not the same anymore, Luke.
This place,

30:22.183 --> 30:25.812
it really used to be something down here,

30:25.896 --> 30:29.190
the drugs, the girls, the music,

30:29.859 --> 30:32.319
the fucking music.

30:33.279 --> 30:34.946
Speaking of which.

30:46.834 --> 30:49.419
What kind of music do you like, Luke?

30:50.296 --> 30:54.591
Tribe Called Quest. Pharcyde. De La Soul.

30:54.675 --> 30:58.971
That's rap, right?
I don't know much about that stuff.

31:01.224 --> 31:04.560
- I'll make you a mixtape.
- I'd like that.

31:06.146 --> 31:08.439
Maybe I'll make you one, too.

31:08.523 --> 31:11.192
Some Bowie, maybe a little Pink Floyd.

31:11.985 --> 31:16.155
Some classical. Brahms, Haydn.

31:18.909 --> 31:22.161
Haydn? Yeah, Haydn's dope.

31:23.413 --> 31:26.582
- You serious?
- No, Dr. Squires.

31:29.629 --> 31:31.171
Hey, Luke.

31:31.255 --> 31:35.926
Why couldn't Mozart find his teacher?
Because he was Haydn.

31:38.096 --> 31:39.763
That's not funny.

31:41.099 --> 31:46.436
- Yo, order me another drink, please?
- Another Bud, right here.

31:53.611 --> 31:55.487
Lucas, I hate my wife.

32:00.660 --> 32:04.247
- I hate my parents.
- I need to get laid.

32:05.124 --> 32:07.125
We both need to get laid.

32:10.295 --> 32:11.379
Lust.

32:12.089 --> 32:16.092
Luke, I've never
cheated on my wife before, ever.

32:17.219 --> 32:21.639
But I want to now, it is my mission.
You have no idea how much I want to.

32:21.724 --> 32:28.104
Sometimes it's right to do the wrong thing,
and right now is one of those times.

32:30.482 --> 32:33.151
But we need to fix ourselves first.

32:33.652 --> 32:37.573
- You need fixing?
- Lucas, I need a whole lot of fixing.

32:42.120 --> 32:45.080
- Union?
- Luke, hi.

32:45.540 --> 32:47.708
I can't believe you're here!

32:48.001 --> 32:51.420
We came in to check out
all the old weird people.

32:53.923 --> 32:55.799
Oh, wait.

32:58.011 --> 33:00.471
- Don't even think about it.
- Is this the mystery girl?

33:00.555 --> 33:03.307
No, but it doesn't mean she's fair game.

33:05.226 --> 33:09.898
This is Gruden. My date to the Midsummer
Night Cancer Ball. It's for charity.

33:10.900 --> 33:15.236
He's an exchange student from Rotterdam.
He's a joke.

33:15.988 --> 33:20.742
Yo, what up? What happened
to home boy you were with in the park?

33:20.826 --> 33:23.036
Albert? Oh, he's so amateur.

33:23.704 --> 33:26.998
Gruden, I'm Haydn.

33:27.082 --> 33:29.334
- Like the classical guy?
- Yes.

33:30.169 --> 33:31.586
I was named after him.

33:31.670 --> 33:35.757
That's so awesome.
Do you like the Grateful Dead?

33:36.342 --> 33:39.220
Followed them for four years after college.

33:54.903 --> 33:57.112
Oh, what do you call that thing?

33:57.197 --> 34:00.449
- It's a blunt.
- It's a blunt. I like that.

34:00.534 --> 34:03.160
- Where was I?
- The second set.

34:03.245 --> 34:06.038
Oh, yeah.

34:06.122 --> 34:10.710
They opened up with Casey Jones.

34:10.795 --> 34:12.629
Driving that train

34:12.713 --> 34:15.549
And that's right when the acid kicked in.

34:16.425 --> 34:17.717
Amazing!

34:19.136 --> 34:23.014
- Your dad's mad cool.
- He's not my dad.

34:23.099 --> 34:29.020
Luke is very into the rap of The Soul Tribe
and many of their other songs.

34:29.105 --> 34:32.274
- Tell her, Luke.
- Tell me.

34:32.358 --> 34:35.277
Tell her. Go ahead, talk. Talk to her.

34:37.071 --> 34:41.616
I'm gonna go get another beer. Gruden, yo!

34:48.542 --> 34:50.751
Goldilocks.

34:51.043 --> 34:54.672
I am one of the three bears.
Guess which one.

34:54.755 --> 34:57.132
- Which one?
- Baby bear.

35:45.016 --> 35:48.937
The game's not called
Four Minutes in Heaven, Luke.

35:49.021 --> 35:50.438
We have like three minutes.

35:50.522 --> 35:53.274
All right, that's enough, kids.
You are all too young to be in here anyway.

35:53.359 --> 35:56.569
Oh, come on. They're all 18.

35:58.030 --> 36:01.866
Since when is the drinking age 21?

36:02.785 --> 36:04.494
Bye, Haydn!

36:04.578 --> 36:07.914
- Since forever.
- Fucking Giuliani.

36:09.750 --> 36:13.378
Look around you, Luke,
is this what you want for your mind?

36:13.462 --> 36:15.546
For your life?
You want it to be like this city?

36:15.631 --> 36:19.551
Sweep all the nasty bits under the rug?
Make everything okay?

36:21.221 --> 36:26.016
He puts the homeless people in prison,
you know? These people are sick, mentally.

36:27.185 --> 36:30.813
They're being put in jail.
What do you think about that, Luke?

36:30.897 --> 36:32.606
- Doesn't seem right.
- No.

36:32.691 --> 36:35.526
No, it doesn't. That's why I don't want you
on medication, Luke.

36:35.610 --> 36:39.071
You may as well open up a Starbucks
in your brain. You follow me?

36:39.155 --> 36:42.366
Don't jump for the quick fix.
This whole fucking city wants a quick fix.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.868
Embrace your pain. Make it a part of you.

36:44.953 --> 36:48.998
You don't want to be like them.
I don't want you to be like them.

36:49.082 --> 36:51.376
So, you've never taken any of that stuff?

36:51.460 --> 36:55.797
Jesus, Luke, I'm on all of it.
I don't want you to be like me, either.

36:57.049 --> 36:58.591
Sex is a drug, too, you know?

36:58.676 --> 37:01.344
More powerful than
any synthetic pharmaceutical.

37:01.429 --> 37:04.681
Yeah? Is that why you go around
trying to fuck little girls?

37:04.765 --> 37:05.974
That was just second base.

37:06.058 --> 37:09.394
Oh, second base, huh?
Hey, what happened to getting fixed first?

37:09.478 --> 37:12.731
Sometimes getting laid is getting fixed,
you know?

37:12.815 --> 37:15.900
Except for dogs. Now break out that blunt.

37:15.985 --> 37:18.987
- This is a joint.
- Joint. I know that.

37:25.954 --> 37:29.290
- Why'd you do that, Luke?
- Tag this wall?

37:29.916 --> 37:33.878
I'm just kind of putting my stamp on it,
fucking let people know I was here.

37:33.962 --> 37:36.589
- It's illegal, isn't it?
- It is.

37:37.424 --> 37:39.592
- May I?
- You may.

37:39.968 --> 37:42.303
- Just be careful.
- Careful.

37:51.313 --> 37:53.314
M. D.

37:59.447 --> 38:02.407
- Excellent penmanship, Dr. Squires.
- Why, thank you.

38:02.492 --> 38:04.951
- Oh, no, I thank you.
- No, no, no, I thank you.

38:05.036 --> 38:06.787
- Oh, you're welcome.
- M. D.

38:11.167 --> 38:13.502
- Hey! You two!
- Fuck!

38:13.920 --> 38:15.545
Stop right there!

38:18.174 --> 38:19.925
Forrest Gump, Luke.

38:20.426 --> 38:23.178
- What are you talking about?
- Running.

38:45.911 --> 38:50.665
Who put you up to this, boys? Giuliani?
You got some kind of quota to fill?

38:50.749 --> 38:52.416
Used to be, you could lick a sheet of acid,

38:52.501 --> 38:54.377
hold up a bank,
fuck a whore in Times Square

38:54.461 --> 38:58.297
without any of you batting an eyelash.
Now, one blunt, we're in the clink.

38:58.382 --> 39:00.801
This whole city's fucked.
We give you character!

39:00.885 --> 39:02.594
Hey, shut the hell up!

39:02.679 --> 39:05.639
Come on, now, brother. Join the revolution!

39:05.723 --> 39:08.976
- What are you in here for?
- I stabbed my wife in the pussy.

39:09.060 --> 39:10.561
Oh, wow!

39:12.063 --> 39:14.565
Yo, Squires, maybe we should keep this
on the DL, all right?

39:14.649 --> 39:16.400
- Yo, DL!
- Quiet!

39:16.860 --> 39:18.819
- Hey, shut up!
- Please, come on!

39:25.243 --> 39:28.078
Shapiro! Squires!

39:28.580 --> 39:30.080
You made bail.

39:31.916 --> 39:33.042
Bail.

39:37.089 --> 39:40.258
- Hi there, Stepdaddy.
- Hi, precious.

39:40.509 --> 39:42.427
- Hey, Steph.
- Shapiro.

39:42.761 --> 39:44.971
Thanks a lot
for getting my stepdad thrown in prison.

39:45.055 --> 39:48.183
You know,
you're really a great influence on him.

39:48.267 --> 39:50.894
- But it wasn't my fault.
- It was my fault.

39:50.978 --> 39:53.563
I know. I was kidding. Anyway.

39:54.940 --> 39:57.400
- What are you doing today?
- Shapiro's busy.

39:57.484 --> 39:59.235
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

39:59.320 --> 40:04.073
Okay, well, look, Squires, why don't you just
take the car back to the garage,

40:04.158 --> 40:07.912
and I won't tell my mom about
this whole prison thing

40:07.996 --> 40:10.289
and Shapiro's coming with me.

40:12.959 --> 40:14.210
Don't touch my daughter, Luke.

40:14.294 --> 40:16.462
- Stepdaughter.
- Stepdaughter.

40:18.131 --> 40:21.675
So, what's the deal
with you and my stepdad?

40:21.760 --> 40:24.261
Are you guys, like, gay together?

40:27.265 --> 40:29.934
- We're friends, I guess.
- Weird.

40:31.269 --> 40:32.978
Not really.

40:34.105 --> 40:37.108
- He's very immature.
- I know.

40:37.443 --> 40:40.403
Him and my mom
fight about that all the time.

40:40.488 --> 40:41.780
I know.

40:43.824 --> 40:46.785
We got more in common
than you think, Steph.

40:47.411 --> 40:52.415
Now, I've got something new for you.
Step up and tap. Go up and tap. Long body.

40:52.500 --> 40:55.543
Remember that knee? Give me one knee
here and then a grapevine.

40:55.628 --> 40:56.753
Hey.

41:05.346 --> 41:08.390
Don't you wanna know
where I was last night?

41:08.474 --> 41:10.393
Do you want to tell me?

41:10.686 --> 41:14.063
- I was having an affair.
- Good for you.

41:15.524 --> 41:20.403
- I was in prison. I went to jail.
- That's nice, Jeffrey.

41:23.365 --> 41:25.074
I'm taking a nap.

41:37.004 --> 41:41.675
- What are you staring at, man?
- I'm looking for my reflection.

41:42.343 --> 41:45.137
Yeah, you're not gonna find it in there.

41:45.680 --> 41:48.056
No shit. That water's mad dirty.

41:51.561 --> 41:54.813
So, how come we, like,
never hung out in school?

41:54.897 --> 41:56.732
'Cause I was a loser.

41:57.775 --> 42:01.778
I mean, not like a loser-loser, you know, but

42:02.864 --> 42:06.241
I was definitely
the most popular of the unpopular.

42:06.326 --> 42:08.660
Or maybe
the most unpopular of the popular.

42:08.745 --> 42:10.078
Maybe.

42:11.914 --> 42:14.667
Either way, you're mad out of my league.

42:15.085 --> 42:17.962
- So what, I'm slumming now?
- Perhaps.

42:20.007 --> 42:22.925
- You want a beer?
- Yeah.

42:39.568 --> 42:41.402
Very handy.

42:45.825 --> 42:47.409
Who is this?

42:48.620 --> 42:50.454
Notorious B. I.G.

42:53.708 --> 42:57.628
- Just came out. Real dope.
- You should make me a mix some time.

42:58.213 --> 43:01.048
- Put this on it.
- Definitely.

43:24.824 --> 43:26.991
No, dude, what are you doing?

43:28.786 --> 43:30.245
Nothing.

43:34.333 --> 43:36.501
Yo, did it feel good?

43:39.880 --> 43:41.673
Let's try it again.

43:49.975 --> 43:51.225
Weird.

44:18.170 --> 44:21.630
- Thank you.
- All right, bye.

45:10.265 --> 45:11.516
Yo, Mom.

45:13.268 --> 45:14.602
Hello.

45:23.028 --> 45:27.366
- Can I make you a sandwich?
- Absolutely.

45:31.746 --> 45:35.707
- Where have you been?
- I think I'm in love.

45:39.420 --> 45:42.172
Well, that's wonderful. Who's the lucky girl?

45:42.257 --> 45:44.091
Stephanie Squires.

45:57.063 --> 46:01.442
- You're up late.
- Oh, hi. So are you.

46:03.988 --> 46:07.657
You have a nice day with Luke?

46:07.741 --> 46:10.743
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

46:14.707 --> 46:16.332
Do you like him?

46:18.335 --> 46:21.004
I don't know. What do you care?

46:21.088 --> 46:24.090
Do you like-like him?

46:24.675 --> 46:26.676
Maybe, yeah.

46:26.760 --> 46:29.804
- He's a drug dealer.
- Yeah, I know. Thank you.

46:31.349 --> 46:36.687
Look, I'm really not in the mood for a father
daughter moment right now, Dr. Squires.

46:37.188 --> 46:40.608
Well, may I watch TV with you?

46:42.527 --> 46:44.278
- Whatever.
- Cool.

46:49.159 --> 46:50.951
So, fill me in.

46:52.037 --> 46:57.458
Well, basically there's been, like,
this big misunderstanding,

46:59.836 --> 47:04.049
- and Mr. Furley thinks Jack's gay.
- I think I've seen this one.

47:07.303 --> 47:10.055
Good morning, Luke. You're up early.

47:11.349 --> 47:13.975
Couldn't sleep. It's mad hot.

47:19.273 --> 47:20.815
What's that?

47:27.490 --> 47:30.367
- We're getting evicted?
- Keep your voice down.

47:30.451 --> 47:35.164
I'll take care of it. I've got a very big deal
coming through. It's not a problem.

47:35.248 --> 47:38.751
- Where will we go?
- I don't know. Downtown, maybe? Jersey?

47:38.835 --> 47:41.462
Not everyone has to live
on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.

47:41.546 --> 47:46.217
- Well, I can't live in Jersey.
- Luke, I messed up, and I'm trying to fix it.

47:47.094 --> 47:49.595
- Then fix it.
- All I can do is try.

47:50.138 --> 47:52.640
Be a man, Dad. Fix it.

47:54.434 --> 47:56.727
What can I do, Luke? Deal pot?

47:58.271 --> 48:00.773
I don't think you'd be very good at that.

48:15.998 --> 48:18.750
So I've been dealing a lot more lately.

48:22.130 --> 48:25.215
I'm just trying to help my folks out,
you know?

48:28.428 --> 48:32.931
- I feel a lot of pressure lately...
- You're totally wrong for each other.

48:33.850 --> 48:37.978
I want you to stop seeing Stephanie.
She's not for you.

48:42.484 --> 48:44.360
What's so bad about me?

48:45.112 --> 48:48.448
She'll break your heart, Luke.
She's just bored.

48:48.866 --> 48:53.161
- That's not true.
- Fine. Ignore my advice.

48:54.163 --> 48:57.123
What? You think she's hot?
You want to fuck her?

48:57.207 --> 48:59.292
Next thing you know,
you've wasted your entire life

48:59.376 --> 49:02.503
on a girl you got nothing
in common with, Luke.

49:03.088 --> 49:07.175
Actually, I was just trying to listen
to your advice, Dr. Squires.

49:07.843 --> 49:09.510
Remember living?

49:13.808 --> 49:16.685
And who said anything about my entire life?

49:17.645 --> 49:21.315
This is it, Luke. This is your life.
The choices you make.

49:22.567 --> 49:25.903
And I guess you've chosen to be
a hoodlum drug dealer,

49:25.987 --> 49:28.489
who latches onto the only girl
who'll pay attention to him,

49:28.573 --> 49:31.408
simply because he's scared of being alone.

49:33.161 --> 49:34.870
And what about you?

49:37.582 --> 49:40.042
Telling me not to take medication.

49:42.045 --> 49:44.964
Your "You don't want me to be like
Times Square" fucking metaphor.

49:45.049 --> 49:46.966
What the fuck was that?

49:48.886 --> 49:52.764
I mean, you said it yourself, right?
You're on half that shit.

49:53.974 --> 49:56.100
You're a fucking hypocrite.

49:57.394 --> 50:00.563
Why are you even
hanging out with me, anyway?

50:01.273 --> 50:07.821
Don't you got some friends your own age?
Don't you feel like a fucking weird old idiot,

50:08.739 --> 50:13.993
just trying to relive your high school years
'cause you fucked them up the first time?

50:14.411 --> 50:16.580
I believe our time is up.

50:19.209 --> 50:22.753
This was a short one,
so I'll just charge you a dime bag.

50:33.682 --> 50:35.432
I made this for you.

52:29.677 --> 52:33.221
- You're home early.
- My last patient canceled.

52:34.723 --> 52:40.144
Actually, he committed suicide yesterday.
Anyway, here I am.

52:42.106 --> 52:43.356
Kristen?

52:45.526 --> 52:47.902
Do you think I'm a weird old guy?

52:48.737 --> 52:51.072
- Yes.
- You do?

52:58.498 --> 53:00.958
You don't love me anymore, do you?

53:01.793 --> 53:03.127
I mean...

53:04.921 --> 53:07.214
I don't blame you. I'm a mess.

53:09.884 --> 53:11.927
You've always been a mess.

53:13.471 --> 53:16.932
But we were a mess together.
We were a beautiful mess.

53:19.936 --> 53:22.104
Are you taking your pills?

53:23.064 --> 53:25.983
I don't need pills. Not those pills, anyway.

53:29.822 --> 53:31.156
What if

53:32.450 --> 53:36.828
we went somewhere? Got out of the city
for a while. Would you like that?

53:37.788 --> 53:38.955
Yeah.

53:40.750 --> 53:42.375
It might be fun.

53:43.502 --> 53:47.338
- Second honeymoon?
- We never had a first one, Jeffrey.

53:49.258 --> 53:50.467
Right.

53:56.974 --> 53:59.559
So, what are you doing this weekend?

53:59.643 --> 54:01.102
- Nothing.
- Good.

54:01.188 --> 54:04.106
My mom and Squires
are going to Barbados or something,

54:04.191 --> 54:05.858
so my house in Fire Island is free.

54:05.942 --> 54:09.820
I was wondering if you wanted
to join me for some beachcombing.

54:10.197 --> 54:11.614
Like a date?

54:14.534 --> 54:16.535
More like a honeymoon.

54:17.954 --> 54:19.455
What'll I do?

54:20.207 --> 54:23.167
You know what people do
on honeymoons, right?

54:25.295 --> 54:26.670
I think so.

54:59.997 --> 55:01.540
It's nice.

55:01.749 --> 55:05.335
- You want some wine?
- Got anything stronger?

55:07.714 --> 55:10.550
- Whiskey?
- Yeah, I'll try.

55:11.593 --> 55:14.554
- Very well.
- You got anything to mix it with?

55:16.014 --> 55:20.351
- There's some juice boxes.
- Yeah, that's good.

55:35.659 --> 55:37.702
Yo, I made this for you.

55:48.214 --> 55:50.174
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

56:00.185 --> 56:02.436
This whiskey's a lot of drunk.

56:04.105 --> 56:05.439
No shit.

56:07.859 --> 56:10.069
So, let me ask you something.

56:13.282 --> 56:15.116
What's going on here?

56:15.910 --> 56:17.577
What do you mean?

56:18.287 --> 56:21.581
I've never been in this situation before.

56:23.000 --> 56:25.168
And what situation is that?

56:26.587 --> 56:27.754
Chilling

56:30.299 --> 56:32.300
with a girl that likes me,

56:33.302 --> 56:34.636
who I like.

56:40.976 --> 56:43.270
I'm just wondering, you know,

56:43.980 --> 56:45.522
what happens?

56:46.942 --> 56:50.152
What happens when everybody comes back?

56:50.654 --> 56:54.031
What do you mean?
Like, do I turn into a pumpkin?

56:55.075 --> 56:56.659
Basically, yeah.

56:58.245 --> 56:59.745
I don't know.

57:02.582 --> 57:04.333
It doesn't matter.

57:05.168 --> 57:06.877
It doesn't matter?

57:08.004 --> 57:09.380
Why not?

57:11.508 --> 57:14.928
Because how could anything possibly
matter right now?

57:18.849 --> 57:21.518
You know what your problem is, Shapiro?

57:21.602 --> 57:26.356
It's that you just have this really
shitty way of looking at things, you know?

57:27.316 --> 57:30.777
I don't have that problem.
I just look at the dopeness.

57:30.861 --> 57:35.365
But, you, it's like you just look
at the wackness, you know?

57:36.325 --> 57:38.368
- I do?
- Yeah.

57:40.288 --> 57:43.999
Well, all you gotta do is just look at me.

57:45.501 --> 57:47.795
- All right.
- And kiss me.

57:47.879 --> 57:49.171
Kiss you.

58:12.988 --> 58:14.572
Take these off.

58:31.215 --> 58:35.927
- Condom? Condom?
- That's what the pill's for.

58:46.314 --> 58:49.608
- You're not really hard.
- No?

58:51.945 --> 58:54.447
Oh, man. Fuck!

58:58.660 --> 58:59.952
Here.

59:05.292 --> 59:07.585
You know, I never drank coffee before.

59:07.669 --> 59:11.089
Really? I drink it all the time. It's like Ritalin.

59:12.257 --> 59:16.511
Yo, Steph, you know,
I'm not trying to be a bitch or nothing, but...

59:17.554 --> 59:21.182
- What?
- I've kind of never had sex before.

59:22.184 --> 59:24.812
- You're a virgin?
- No!

59:28.274 --> 59:31.693
- I just never officially had sex.
- Okay.

59:32.320 --> 59:35.114
I think that's why I'm nervous, you know?

59:36.908 --> 59:38.867
That's why the thing with my dick.

59:38.952 --> 59:43.747
Oh, Shapiro, don't worry about it. It's okay.

59:43.832 --> 59:46.375
I've done it, like, a hundred times.

59:46.668 --> 59:50.045
- I can teach you.
- I'm down.

59:50.630 --> 59:52.131
You sober yet?

59:54.843 --> 59:57.762
- Probably.
- Okay.

59:58.806 --> 01:00:01.516
I think it's time for our first lesson.

01:00:16.991 --> 01:00:20.368
Okay, now. Just put it in.

01:00:22.913 --> 01:00:25.582
Slower, okay? Slower.

01:00:26.542 --> 01:00:29.044
Yeah. Now just move in...

01:00:33.508 --> 01:00:35.718
No fucking way.

01:00:37.095 --> 01:00:38.721
Did you just come?

01:00:40.182 --> 01:00:42.183
You fucking came.

01:00:43.685 --> 01:00:45.436
Oh, fuck.

01:00:49.858 --> 01:00:51.901
- Are you crying?
- No.

01:00:55.071 --> 01:00:56.864
Oh, God.

01:00:58.533 --> 01:01:01.536
We haven't stayed up all night in 10 years.

01:01:04.999 --> 01:01:06.458
Yeah, we did.

01:01:08.544 --> 01:01:09.878
We did?

01:01:12.840 --> 01:01:14.382
Yeah, we did.

01:01:15.843 --> 01:01:19.179
New Year's Eve, four years ago.

01:01:21.891 --> 01:01:26.770
Remember that coke that you found
that we hid, from the '80s?

01:01:29.649 --> 01:01:30.982
We did it.

01:01:32.027 --> 01:01:35.279
We fucked like little bunny rabbits
on the balcony.

01:01:42.704 --> 01:01:44.747
We woke up Steph,

01:01:44.831 --> 01:01:48.793
and you told her we were out there
trying to save a sick pigeon.

01:01:50.462 --> 01:01:54.507
I do, I do. I do remember that.

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:02.348
What happened to us, Kristen?

01:02:06.604 --> 01:02:09.523
- You're kidding, right?
- Right.

01:02:10.692 --> 01:02:12.109
I'm kidding.

01:02:29.877 --> 01:02:31.503
I love you.

01:02:36.594 --> 01:02:38.344
I love you, Steph.

01:02:48.022 --> 01:02:50.231
I love you, Steph. I love you.

01:02:57.448 --> 01:03:00.908
I got mad love for you, shorty.
That's on the real.

01:03:02.036 --> 01:03:05.830
I wanna listen to Boyz II Men
when I'm with you.

01:03:35.737 --> 01:03:37.571
Hey, surprise.

01:04:23.203 --> 01:04:24.537
Right here.

01:05:12.628 --> 01:05:13.920
Word.

01:05:36.361 --> 01:05:37.904
I love you.

01:05:39.323 --> 01:05:40.823
Whoa, dude.

01:06:36.715 --> 01:06:39.259
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

01:06:40.719 --> 01:06:43.388
- Sunburn.
- Oh, yeah, right.

01:06:44.682 --> 01:06:46.933
All right, I'll see you later.

01:07:19.759 --> 01:07:21.135
Thank you.

01:07:30.479 --> 01:07:34.274
- I want a divorce.
- Me, too.

01:07:46.662 --> 01:07:47.704
Hey.

01:07:50.166 --> 01:07:53.835
Hey, sweetheart. How was your weekend?

01:07:55.046 --> 01:07:58.966
- Uneventful.
- You got a nice tan there, Steph.

01:07:59.509 --> 01:08:03.679
Yeah? Anyway, I'm going to bed.
I just wanted to say hey.

01:08:04.389 --> 01:08:06.933
- Good night, angel.
- We love you.

01:08:59.612 --> 01:09:04.367
Yo, you've reached Steph. I ain't home,
so leave a message at the tone. Peace.

01:09:05.077 --> 01:09:07.828
Yo, Steph, what up?

01:09:07.912 --> 01:09:10.415
It's me, Luke.

01:09:13.419 --> 01:09:19.506
I know you said you'd call me this week, and
it's a week from when you said that, so...

01:09:21.010 --> 01:09:24.929
I mean, I guess there's
still time in the week, technically.

01:09:25.596 --> 01:09:28.933
I mean, technically,
there's a couple of hours left.

01:09:29.475 --> 01:09:31.602
I hope you're aware of that.

01:09:31.937 --> 01:09:35.691
Look, are you not calling me back
'cause I said I love you?

01:09:37.527 --> 01:09:40.194
'Cause that's stupid. I mean...

01:09:42.698 --> 01:09:47.202
I didn't mean it really,
and, you know, even if I did,

01:09:47.287 --> 01:09:51.622
I'm going to college in three weeks,
so it's not like it matters.

01:09:56.796 --> 01:09:58.338
You know what?

01:10:00.300 --> 01:10:03.969
Fuck it. I meant it.

01:10:05.221 --> 01:10:09.309
I do love you. All right?
I'm not scared to say it.

01:10:09.393 --> 01:10:13.563
I fucking love you, okay?
And if that scares you,

01:10:14.106 --> 01:10:17.567
well, then fuck you. You know what?

01:10:17.651 --> 01:10:21.571
Fuck off, all right? You're a fucking bitch.
Peace out forever!

01:10:34.835 --> 01:10:36.127
Come in.

01:10:41.718 --> 01:10:43.052
Shapiro?

01:10:44.137 --> 01:10:45.805
She got bored.

01:10:48.058 --> 01:10:52.436
With all due respect to my stepdaughter,
Luke, fuck her. Fuck them all.

01:10:52.521 --> 01:10:56.524
As Biggie says,
"Bitches, I like 'em brainless."

01:10:56.608 --> 01:10:59.110
"Guns, I like 'em stainless steel."

01:11:10.413 --> 01:11:12.541
Dr. Squires, do you remember

01:11:13.626 --> 01:11:15.627
when you told me that shit

01:11:16.796 --> 01:11:20.841
about men doing the things they need to do

01:11:22.260 --> 01:11:25.428
to become the men they need to become

01:11:26.597 --> 01:11:29.057
- or something?
- No.

01:11:30.393 --> 01:11:32.686
Well, I need your help.

01:11:35.314 --> 01:11:37.065
What is it, Lucas?

01:11:38.401 --> 01:11:41.153
You know anybody
who could use some weed?

01:11:42.780 --> 01:11:46.117
I got some extra weight
I need to unload this month.

01:11:49.079 --> 01:11:52.999
We could probably work something out.

01:12:00.299 --> 01:12:03.843
All right, if we're gonna do this,
Dr. Squires, we're gonna do it right.

01:12:03.927 --> 01:12:06.179
- All right? You gotta be more careful.
- Don't worry, Luke.

01:12:06.263 --> 01:12:08.639
- I'm not going back to prison.
- Good.

01:12:09.099 --> 01:12:13.227
Let's establish a few ground rules.
Number one, we use pagers.

01:12:13.395 --> 01:12:15.731
Someone pages us,
we call them back from a payphone.

01:12:15.815 --> 01:12:18.483
We never use home phones
for this type of stuff. Never.

01:12:18.568 --> 01:12:22.029
That's great, Luke. I already have a pager
for my medical practice.

01:12:22.113 --> 01:12:23.739
All right, good.

01:12:23.823 --> 01:12:28.202
Number two, we sell weed by the gram,
by the eighth, and by the ounce.

01:12:28.786 --> 01:12:32.372
Gram's the highest profit margin,
but it's also the most potent,

01:12:32.457 --> 01:12:34.416
that's why we try to
encourage people to buy the grams.

01:12:34.500 --> 01:12:38.045
Principal Edwards, I can give you
two grams for 125 bucks, all right?

01:12:38.129 --> 01:12:40.839
Anything less than that,
I don't make a profit.

01:12:40.924 --> 01:12:43.842
You always were very good at math, Luke.

01:12:45.428 --> 01:12:47.262
All right, 11 grand,

01:12:47.347 --> 01:12:50.308
plus another 10 Zs at a grand a Z.

01:12:50.643 --> 01:12:51.726
It's a start.

01:13:07.243 --> 01:13:08.576
Hey, Oliver.

01:13:08.661 --> 01:13:12.205
- How's the golf game?
- Not bad, Doc. Not too bad.

01:13:13.791 --> 01:13:16.000
- How's your mother?
- Still projecting.

01:13:16.085 --> 01:13:19.587
Oh, I'm sorry.
Call the office to make an appointment.

01:13:20.674 --> 01:13:22.925
Now, how much marijuana
can I get for you today?

01:13:26.054 --> 01:13:28.847
Exactly how much money
are we trying to make here, Luke?

01:13:28.932 --> 01:13:30.724
As much as possible.

01:13:31.685 --> 01:13:34.353
What's all this for, Luke?
If you don't mind me asking.

01:13:42.404 --> 01:13:43.737
College.

01:13:52.915 --> 01:13:54.332
It's okay.

01:14:00.548 --> 01:14:03.675
- Who the fuck is you?
- Who the fuck is you?

01:14:04.093 --> 01:14:07.178
Yo, Percy! He's cool, all right?

01:14:07.263 --> 01:14:10.348
- I'm cool, Percy.
- Me will be the judge of that.

01:14:13.602 --> 01:14:15.270
- Stop that.
- Sorry.

01:14:24.531 --> 01:14:26.365
The drowning represents

01:14:26.450 --> 01:14:31.662
an inability to get a handle on your life,
what you're doing, perhaps your business.

01:14:32.831 --> 01:14:35.916
The girl, well, I don't know.

01:14:36.001 --> 01:14:38.919
When in doubt,
I usually go with your mother.

01:14:39.546 --> 01:14:43.674
My mother. That make a lot more sense now.

01:14:44.885 --> 01:14:46.260
Yo, fellas?

01:14:47.387 --> 01:14:50.723
I hate to interrupt, but, Pers,
I need more, man.

01:14:52.768 --> 01:14:56.646
- You can't just leave it downstairs?
- Not in this neighborhood.

01:14:56.731 --> 01:14:58.774
I can't believe this is a fifth floor walk-up.

01:14:58.858 --> 01:15:01.860
Oh, please behave yourself,
Dr. Squires, all right?

01:15:01.944 --> 01:15:06.198
- This is my connect.
- Who the fuck lives in a fifth floor...

01:15:06.282 --> 01:15:07.616
Hi, Luke.

01:15:08.117 --> 01:15:11.161
...walk-up. Hello.
- Hi.

01:15:12.914 --> 01:15:16.416
Come on in. I'm Elanor.

01:15:17.085 --> 01:15:19.711
I'm Haydn.

01:15:19.796 --> 01:15:24.257
- No need for aliases with her, Squires.
- Oh, well, then I'm Jeff.

01:15:24.342 --> 01:15:26.635
Oh, I'm still Elanor.

01:15:34.395 --> 01:15:38.648
- So, how much you need?
- A quarter.

01:15:40.025 --> 01:15:43.611
I'm going to see that guy in New Hampshire.

01:15:44.113 --> 01:15:50.827
I was just packing and stuff and then I was
thinking I need some grass. I almost forgot.

01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:55.498
So, that's how this happened.

01:15:55.582 --> 01:15:57.583
- So, a quarter, then?
- A quarter. Yeah.

01:15:57.668 --> 01:15:59.710
He doesn't appreciate you.

01:16:00.462 --> 01:16:03.507
- How do you know that?
- He couldn't possibly.

01:16:03.842 --> 01:16:07.010
- That's a compliment, right?
- Ma'am.

01:16:09.264 --> 01:16:13.183
Here it is. And I have this for you, too.

01:16:13.268 --> 01:16:14.309
Thanks.

01:16:15.478 --> 01:16:16.603
It's the greatest hits?

01:16:16.688 --> 01:16:20.357
Well, actually,
it's more like three songs, mixes...

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:23.026
Well, really it's more like one song.

01:16:24.404 --> 01:16:26.780
You were in Emergency Breakthrough?

01:16:26.865 --> 01:16:28.365
- Yeah.
- No shit.

01:16:28.992 --> 01:16:31.410
- I love your music.
- What?

01:16:34.039 --> 01:16:37.876
See, Luke?
I told you I know a little about music.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.295
I keep trying to broaden his horizons,

01:16:40.379 --> 01:16:42.881
you know, rap music isn't everything.
I tell him, but...

01:16:42.965 --> 01:16:44.466
You should listen to this woman, Luke.

01:16:44.550 --> 01:16:47.677
She's as smart and talented
as she is beautiful.

01:16:49.305 --> 01:16:53.475
- He's really out of his mind, right?
- Total fucking lunatic.

01:16:59.231 --> 01:17:00.607
Hey, Steph.

01:17:02.359 --> 01:17:05.153
So, I guess you're ignoring me, huh?

01:17:05.989 --> 01:17:07.573
That's a shame,

01:17:09.868 --> 01:17:15.039
because it would be really cool to hang out
or whatever before I go to school.

01:17:17.834 --> 01:17:21.170
The school year is rapidly approaching,
as you know.

01:17:23.840 --> 01:17:25.090
And...

01:17:28.887 --> 01:17:30.221
I miss you.

01:17:32.516 --> 01:17:33.891
- But I love you.
- No, you don't.

01:17:33.975 --> 01:17:37.269
Please, Kristen. Don't leave me all alone.
I can't be all alone.

01:17:37.395 --> 01:17:40.482
Cut the crap, Jeffrey. You asked for it.

01:17:41.108 --> 01:17:44.528
Stephanie? Are you leaving, too?

01:17:44.612 --> 01:17:48.949
No. Stephie will be here
for the next few weeks.

01:17:50.117 --> 01:17:53.620
- I'll deal with all the details when I'm back.
- Details?

01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:56.831
Please, say something
to your mother, Steph.

01:17:56.916 --> 01:17:59.751
Jeffrey, leave her out of this.

01:18:02.296 --> 01:18:05.632
Sweetheart, go to your fucking room.

01:18:17.938 --> 01:18:22.400
It would be really cool to hang out
or whatever before I go to school.

01:18:22.484 --> 01:18:26.988
The school year is rapidly approaching,
as you know.

01:18:28.240 --> 01:18:29.574
I miss you.

01:18:33.829 --> 01:18:35.997
- Shapiro?
- What?

01:18:36.623 --> 01:18:40.001
- Justin?
- Yo, why you calling me Shapiro?

01:18:41.461 --> 01:18:42.963
No reason.

01:18:44.257 --> 01:18:49.344
- How was Florence?
- Oh, it was crazy, yo, mad crazy.

01:18:49.679 --> 01:18:54.808
Yo, I'll tell you all about it. We're hitting
this club downtown tonight. You coming?

01:18:55.768 --> 01:18:58.979
- Yeah, totally.
- Yeah.

01:18:59.063 --> 01:19:02.274
- Doll your shit up.
- Okay, call me later.

01:19:02.358 --> 01:19:03.775
- Peace.
- Bye.

01:19:31.055 --> 01:19:33.598
Yo, what happened?

01:19:33.682 --> 01:19:36.142
- What happened?
- What do you think?

01:19:36.977 --> 01:19:39.979
Wait, wait, wait. Wait, Dad. I have money!

01:19:40.064 --> 01:19:42.440
- Put that down. I got money!
- Leave the guys alone.

01:19:42.524 --> 01:19:45.610
- Let them do their job.
- Dad, I got $26,000,

01:19:45.694 --> 01:19:47.613
that should be more than enough.

01:19:47.697 --> 01:19:49.531
- Luke.
- What?

01:19:51.034 --> 01:19:55.371
It's not enough. It's not even close.

01:19:59.334 --> 01:20:03.087
You said you'd fix it.
You said you'd fix it, right?

01:20:03.838 --> 01:20:07.341
I need you to go upstairs
and pack up your room, okay?

01:20:08.968 --> 01:20:11.553
Go on upstairs. Pack up your room.

01:20:11.638 --> 01:20:14.014
Hey, be careful with that, would you, guys?

01:20:14.099 --> 01:20:17.142
Are you being careful
with my father's silver?

01:20:31.992 --> 01:20:35.495
- What are you doing?
- Marking my territory.

01:20:37.665 --> 01:20:39.582
You need some help?

01:21:58.207 --> 01:22:00.082
- Yo!
- Hi, Steph.

01:22:01.251 --> 01:22:04.253
Look, I know the summer's almost over

01:22:05.088 --> 01:22:07.507
but I think we can make this work.

01:22:07.591 --> 01:22:09.801
- Luke...
- Just hear me out, all right?

01:22:09.885 --> 01:22:13.429
People do the long-distance thing
all the time, you know,

01:22:13.514 --> 01:22:16.474
and we're not going to school
that far away from each other.

01:22:16.558 --> 01:22:21.562
It's like a four-hour train ride, so,
we could alternate weekends, whatever.

01:22:21.647 --> 01:22:25.358
- Is that Shapiro?
- Is that Justin?

01:22:29.405 --> 01:22:30.906
Shapiro.

01:22:34.077 --> 01:22:36.912
Hi, baby. Yo, you got any weed?

01:22:38.998 --> 01:22:40.207
No.

01:22:41.251 --> 01:22:42.417
Okay.

01:22:47.841 --> 01:22:50.801
- Look, Luke...
- Where's Squires?

01:22:51.928 --> 01:22:54.263
- He's in Fire Island.
- Peace.

01:22:54.347 --> 01:22:55.597
Yo, wait.

01:23:36.391 --> 01:23:37.641
Luke.

01:23:43.481 --> 01:23:47.484
I apologize for the mess.
I wasn't expecting company.

01:23:50.989 --> 01:23:55.784
- You've been doing all these drugs?
- It's an experiment. An experience.

01:23:57.370 --> 01:24:00.956
Life. Salvation. Drugs. Go ahead.

01:24:05.379 --> 01:24:07.297
I've never done
most of this stuff before, Jeff.

01:24:07.381 --> 01:24:09.716
Come on, Luke, be a pal, do it.

01:24:30.821 --> 01:24:32.155
The ocean.

01:24:34.075 --> 01:24:36.494
This is all I need, Luke.

01:24:38.163 --> 01:24:40.706
Forget the city, the city is wrong.

01:24:41.875 --> 01:24:46.170
I just want to wrap myself in the ocean.

01:24:48.715 --> 01:24:50.049
I cannot

01:24:52.219 --> 01:24:54.595
- speak.
- That's the spirit, Luke.

01:24:55.472 --> 01:24:57.515
Hit me with it! Come on, hit me!

01:24:57.599 --> 01:25:02.144
You don't think I can take it?
I can take everything you got, fucking sea!

01:25:15.743 --> 01:25:17.077
I want a

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:22.624
- vagina.
- You said it, Luke.

01:25:23.584 --> 01:25:27.254
I should have known
when she told me she didn't like dogs.

01:25:29.090 --> 01:25:32.884
There's certain people
you just can't trust, you know, Luke?

01:25:33.594 --> 01:25:35.679
Listen to me. Never trust

01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:39.474
anyone who doesn't smoke pot
or listen to Bob Dylan. You hear me?

01:25:39.559 --> 01:25:42.353
Never trust anyone
who doesn't like the beach.

01:25:42.438 --> 01:25:46.399
Never, ever, ever,

01:25:47.776 --> 01:25:51.029
trust anyone who says they don't like dogs.

01:25:51.113 --> 01:25:53.322
If you meet someone who doesn't like dogs,

01:25:53.407 --> 01:25:57.952
you alert the authorities immediately,
and sure as shit don't marry them!

01:25:58.203 --> 01:26:00.621
Okay. Okay.

01:26:01.582 --> 01:26:03.166
Nothing's okay.

01:26:04.752 --> 01:26:08.713
None of it's gonna be okay,
everything is going to be terrible.

01:26:10.299 --> 01:26:12.801
I tried to kill myself twice today.

01:26:13.636 --> 01:26:17.765
Once with pills, turns out I have
a very high tolerance for those.

01:26:18.475 --> 01:26:23.270
Next by hanging. The hanging is very hard.
The weight.

01:26:23.605 --> 01:26:28.025
You lose too much weight,
or you put on too much weight...

01:26:29.944 --> 01:26:31.195
Oh, well.

01:26:31.279 --> 01:26:34.865
- Dr. Squires, what are you talking about?
- I don't know.

01:26:35.617 --> 01:26:38.702
I just... I'm done.

01:26:40.789 --> 01:26:45.543
This is it. Last call, Luke.
I'm glad you're here to see me off.

01:26:51.342 --> 01:26:54.344
- Where you going, Dr. Squires?
- In there.

01:26:55.054 --> 01:26:57.013
I'm ready to die, Luke.

01:26:58.349 --> 01:27:00.225
Stop fucking around, Jeff.

01:27:00.309 --> 01:27:04.354
I'm the weird old guy, remember?
You said so yourself.

01:27:06.023 --> 01:27:09.734
Look, I didn't mean it, all right?
You're my friend.

01:27:11.195 --> 01:27:13.113
You're my best friend.

01:27:13.197 --> 01:27:16.282
So just, please,
would you come back for me?

01:27:16.367 --> 01:27:19.245
You're not worth it, Shapiro!

01:27:20.455 --> 01:27:22.790
So that was all bullshit, right?

01:27:23.542 --> 01:27:27.670
All that stuff about embracing your pain,
making it a part of you?

01:27:31.091 --> 01:27:32.842
You can't do this!

01:27:33.802 --> 01:27:35.719
You can't just give up.

01:27:36.471 --> 01:27:39.557
Life is hard and it's full of pain
and what not,

01:27:40.142 --> 01:27:43.310
but we take it 'cause there's great stuff, too!

01:27:44.563 --> 01:27:46.981
And we can do it because we have friends!

01:27:47.065 --> 01:27:49.151
Because we help each other!

01:27:49.902 --> 01:27:52.737
Stop! Stop!

01:28:59.224 --> 01:29:00.349
Luke!

01:29:31.215 --> 01:29:34.842
That was really fucking cheesy,
what you said just then.

01:29:38.389 --> 01:29:41.683
There's enough assholes in the world,
Dr. Squires.

01:29:43.602 --> 01:29:45.603
Don't be another one.

01:29:47.106 --> 01:29:49.107
Now you sound like me.

01:29:59.452 --> 01:30:02.913
You wanna go to the city
to fill out my prescriptions?

01:30:06.626 --> 01:30:08.043
Sounds good.

01:30:21.683 --> 01:30:24.560
- Thank you, Luke.
- How you feeling?

01:30:30.151 --> 01:30:32.277
Please, don't do that again.

01:30:33.738 --> 01:30:36.740
- All right? You scared me.
- I'm sorry.

01:30:38.576 --> 01:30:40.827
Dr. Squires, I gotta get back.

01:30:42.163 --> 01:30:43.580
To my folks.

01:30:44.290 --> 01:30:48.918
- Where you living these days, Luke?
- We're moving in with my grandparents.

01:30:50.921 --> 01:30:53.882
- In New Jersey.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

01:30:54.592 --> 01:30:56.426
I'm sorry to live it.

01:30:58.763 --> 01:31:01.097
I'm sorry about Stephanie, too.

01:31:06.396 --> 01:31:08.814
She would have been a lucky girl.

01:31:11.526 --> 01:31:13.361
Good luck in school.

01:31:16.031 --> 01:31:20.284
Try and fuck a black girl.
I never got the chance at college.

01:31:26.958 --> 01:31:28.334
Baby steps.

01:31:30.629 --> 01:31:32.129
It'll be okay.

01:31:32.881 --> 01:31:36.635
- I can't answer that.
- It wasn't a question.

01:31:38.137 --> 01:31:41.264
- Peace, Doc.
- Peace out, Luke.

01:31:55.822 --> 01:31:59.199
- Luke. Hey.
- Hey.

01:31:59.283 --> 01:32:02.911
- Look, man, I just wanted to say...
- Do me a favor, Steph.

01:32:03.996 --> 01:32:06.039
Don't say nothing, okay?

01:32:07.167 --> 01:32:09.460
Just stand there till I leave.

01:32:10.170 --> 01:32:12.171
I wanna remember this.

01:32:13.674 --> 01:32:17.176
- I've never done it before.
- Never done what?

01:32:20.264 --> 01:32:22.265
Had my heart broken.

01:33:06.394 --> 01:33:08.687
To Luke Shapiro.

01:33:10.356 --> 01:33:11.608
Luke.

01:33:13.319 --> 01:33:14.444
Luke?

01:33:15.279 --> 01:33:16.613
Have you had any more thoughts

01:33:16.697 --> 01:33:20.158
about what you're gonna be
as far as a profession goes?

01:33:20.242 --> 01:33:22.911
- Mom, he's got time.
- I'm just asking.

01:33:23.579 --> 01:33:25.538
Actually, I'm thinking about
becoming a shrink.

01:33:25.623 --> 01:33:27.499
Psychology!

01:33:27.583 --> 01:33:31.002
It's not quite the shoe business,
but it's a very interesting field.

01:33:31.086 --> 01:33:35.924
I figure I'm an expert 'cause everyone
around me is so fucking crazy, you know?

01:34:11.628 --> 01:34:14.755
- Hello?
- Somebody paged me from this number?

01:34:14.839 --> 01:34:18.677
Hi, Jeffrey? It's Elanor.

01:34:19.136 --> 01:34:23.265
Luke gave me your number. He said
I should page you. I hope that's okay.

01:34:23.349 --> 01:34:26.476
- Yeah, it's okay.
- So...

01:34:27.311 --> 01:34:29.396
What are you doing tonight?

01:34:31.357 --> 01:34:32.691
No plans.
