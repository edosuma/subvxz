10:40.582 --> 10:42.281
[grunting]

10:42.283 --> 10:43.850
I just got word

10:43.852 --> 10:46.586
that a shrouded body was
seen being loaded into an SUV

10:46.588 --> 10:49.755
behind Rousseau's while
Freya Mikaelson stood watch.

10:49.757 --> 10:50.990
So?

10:50.992 --> 10:52.158
[groaning]: So,

10:52.160 --> 10:54.927
they're headed to Algiers.

10:54.929 --> 10:57.330
I'll intercept them and get Marcel back.

10:57.332 --> 10:59.165
It is clear to me that
your feelings for him

10:59.167 --> 11:01.055
have gotten in the way
of our greater mission,

11:01.058 --> 11:03.136
so I will take care of Marcel.

11:03.138 --> 11:05.538
[panting]

11:05.540 --> 11:08.341
Our deal was for the Mikaelsons.

11:09.377 --> 11:11.110
Marcel is with me.

11:11.112 --> 11:12.745
Then it would appear

11:12.747 --> 11:14.814
that I've broken that deal.

11:17.585 --> 11:18.951
[yelling]

11:18.953 --> 11:20.319
[groaning]

11:21.956 --> 11:23.222
[gasping]

11:23.224 --> 11:25.324
Keep that safe for me, will you?

11:32.393 --> 11:35.928
[huffing]

11:39.800 --> 11:42.968
[footfalls approaching]

11:45.112 --> 11:46.779
[gate creaking]

11:49.977 --> 11:51.274
Hi.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.712
I think this is yours.

11:56.951 --> 11:58.651
Hope.

12:03.691 --> 12:06.091
I haven't seen this in a century.

12:06.093 --> 12:10.763
So, you're the little boy
who used to live in my house.

12:10.765 --> 12:13.265
Once upon a time, I
lived here with your dad.

12:13.267 --> 12:15.200
He keeps you down here

12:15.202 --> 12:17.302
because he thinks you want to kill him.

12:17.304 --> 12:18.999
Do you?

12:19.002 --> 12:20.302
Listen,

12:20.305 --> 12:22.174
I will tell you anything
you want to know.

12:22.176 --> 12:23.676
Okay?

12:23.678 --> 12:25.944
If you get me some blood
from your dad's stash.

12:25.946 --> 12:28.213
I'm seven, not stupid.

12:28.215 --> 12:29.548
[chuckles]

12:29.550 --> 12:31.550
Right.

12:32.753 --> 12:34.820
You know, you're also pretty courageous.

12:34.822 --> 12:37.056
Come down here and talk to a stranger.

12:37.058 --> 12:38.524
I'm not scared.

12:38.526 --> 12:40.426
I'm a Mikaelson witch.

12:41.295 --> 12:43.162
I'll tell you what,

12:43.164 --> 12:45.531
let's start fresh, all right?

12:46.500 --> 12:49.902
It is very good to see
you again, Hope Mikaelson.

12:49.904 --> 12:52.337
My name's Marcel.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.244
FREYA: <i>Mutare seu rosto.</i>

12:59.246 --> 13:00.846
<i>Mutare seu rosto.</i>

13:00.848 --> 13:03.048
- [groaning]
- <i>Mutare seu rosto.</i>

13:03.050 --> 13:05.884
<i>Mutare seu rosto. Mutare seu rosto.</i>

13:05.886 --> 13:09.555
[screaming]

13:09.557 --> 13:12.091
<i>Mutare seu rosto.</i>

13:12.093 --> 13:13.726
[gasping]

13:13.728 --> 13:15.260
Josh...

13:15.262 --> 13:17.596
Josh?

13:17.598 --> 13:19.431
Are you all right?

13:22.203 --> 13:23.702
Say something.

13:24.538 --> 13:25.871
I'm just...

13:25.873 --> 13:28.741
super overwhelmed by
the sheer number of jokes

13:28.743 --> 13:30.809
I could make about being in this body.

13:30.811 --> 13:33.507
It is an embarrassment of
really inappropriate riches.

13:33.510 --> 13:35.557
Okay, well, when you're
done entertaining yourself,

13:35.560 --> 13:37.349
I'd love to get back to
the life or death situation

13:37.351 --> 13:38.383
we're dealing with.

13:38.385 --> 13:40.221
- Right.
- Thank you.

13:40.224 --> 13:41.820
Lay down in the circle.

13:43.691 --> 13:45.624
Now, the second Dominic
sets foot in the circle,

13:45.626 --> 13:46.859
you get the hell out.

13:46.861 --> 13:48.861
Use every bit of vamp
speed you got, okay?

13:48.863 --> 13:49.895
He can't do

13:49.897 --> 13:51.130
magic in the circle, but

13:51.132 --> 13:52.297
he does have a weapon strong enough

13:52.299 --> 13:53.298
to kill an Original.

13:53.300 --> 13:55.400
Oh, awesome.

13:55.402 --> 13:58.837
Hey, Freya, I was just thinking

13:58.839 --> 14:00.405
let's never hang out again.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.941
Like, ever.

14:04.612 --> 14:07.312
[indistinct chatter]

14:09.917 --> 14:11.650
[footfalls approaching]

14:11.652 --> 14:15.454
HAYLEY: Elijah isn't
answering his phone.

14:15.456 --> 14:17.070
I'll try Freya.

14:17.073 --> 14:19.291
You might want to hold onto these.

14:19.293 --> 14:21.026
[line ringing]

14:21.028 --> 14:23.427
We should take more family pictures.

14:23.430 --> 14:26.187
There is a reason
vampires avoid photographs.

14:26.190 --> 14:27.800
Well, not everyone in this family

14:27.802 --> 14:29.835
is immortal anymore.

14:29.837 --> 14:32.171
Freya being one of them.

14:32.173 --> 14:33.505
She's not picking up, either.

14:33.507 --> 14:36.074
I'm sure they're fine.
They're just busy.

14:36.076 --> 14:38.377
You know, this is a fool's errand.

14:38.379 --> 14:40.345
We're not gonna accomplish
anything in this mess.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.413
I should be out there...

14:41.415 --> 14:43.015
Dodging an evil ghost
who wants you dead?

14:43.017 --> 14:44.349
No. You're safe here.

14:44.351 --> 14:45.651
Safe and entirely ineffective.

14:45.653 --> 14:46.919
Your daughter needs you.

14:46.921 --> 14:48.320
My daughter needs the Hollow

14:48.322 --> 14:49.888
to be purged from this earth.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.766
Why are you yelling at
me? I'm on your side.

14:51.769 --> 14:53.725
'Cause I can't be trapped here!

14:56.664 --> 14:59.164
You're not in a dungeon anymore.

14:59.166 --> 15:00.566
It's okay.

15:01.468 --> 15:02.901
[sighs]

15:04.304 --> 15:08.472
The water in the pipes was
like nails on a chalkboard.

15:08.475 --> 15:11.243
I was starving.

15:11.245 --> 15:12.778
I could smell the blood

15:12.780 --> 15:14.179
from the people on the street above me,

15:14.181 --> 15:15.614
I could hear their heartbeats.

15:15.616 --> 15:18.517
My own mind turned against me.

15:18.519 --> 15:20.485
It was taunting me.

15:21.322 --> 15:23.088
It was relentless.

15:25.526 --> 15:28.360
The first few weeks were the worst.

15:28.362 --> 15:30.596
You're worried about Marcel.

15:33.901 --> 15:35.701
No.

15:35.703 --> 15:38.270
Let him suffer.

15:42.476 --> 15:45.410
[footfalls approaching]

16:01.562 --> 16:03.695
<i>Libérer a verite a.</i>

16:07.201 --> 16:09.468
[gasping]

16:11.171 --> 16:12.838
Will someone deal with her?!

16:12.840 --> 16:14.640
[grunting]

16:15.242 --> 16:17.376
[yelling]

16:17.378 --> 16:18.744
- [gasping]
- [Dominic growling]

16:18.746 --> 16:20.045
[Freya grunts]

16:26.811 --> 16:28.787
What is this?

16:28.789 --> 16:29.855
JOSH: That's a shame.

16:29.857 --> 16:32.124
Things do not look good for you.

16:32.126 --> 16:34.493
You imbecile.

16:34.495 --> 16:36.461
You have no idea what
you're dealing with.

16:36.463 --> 16:41.066
A bit of bluster wrapped
up in a protection spell.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.868
I'm unimpressed.

16:42.870 --> 16:44.002
[screaming]

16:46.273 --> 16:49.041
[footfalls approaching]

16:49.044 --> 16:52.946
I do not like being summoned, Elijah.

16:53.781 --> 16:55.013
[shuddering breath]

16:55.883 --> 16:57.916
Oh, no.

16:58.919 --> 17:01.086
No...

17:03.213 --> 17:05.824
Elijah, what did you do?

17:05.826 --> 17:07.392
Four French Quarter witches,

17:07.394 --> 17:08.794
killed on consecrated ground,

17:08.796 --> 17:09.928
with a ceremonial blade.

17:09.930 --> 17:12.263
This is not how you do it, man!

17:12.266 --> 17:13.632
There's a ceremony!

17:13.634 --> 17:14.700
Then there's a ritual!

17:14.703 --> 17:17.035
- The girls got to be selected!
- You find a way.

17:17.037 --> 17:19.570
And then the girls will be resurrected.

17:19.573 --> 17:21.772
Any delay only helps our enemy.

17:29.611 --> 17:31.544
You know, I'm surprised

17:31.547 --> 17:34.146
your parents haven't stormed
down here looking for you.

17:34.148 --> 17:35.481
My mom trusts me.

17:35.483 --> 17:37.183
Yeah.

17:37.185 --> 17:40.309
But your dad's never
trusted anyone in his life.

17:40.312 --> 17:42.255
If he took care of you
when you were little,

17:42.257 --> 17:43.689
why do you hate him?

17:44.893 --> 17:46.359
What did he do to you?

17:52.667 --> 17:54.901
Your dad, he raised me.

17:54.903 --> 17:57.169
He made me who I am.

17:57.171 --> 17:59.505
Now, you ask if I hate him.

17:59.507 --> 18:01.507
Well,

18:01.509 --> 18:02.742
it's hard to hate the person

18:02.744 --> 18:04.076
who made you what you are.

18:04.078 --> 18:07.046
You just end up hating yourself.

18:07.916 --> 18:09.682
The truth is

18:09.684 --> 18:11.350
I would like to hate your dad,

18:11.352 --> 18:12.818
I really would.

18:12.820 --> 18:15.354
It would make things a lot easier.

18:16.224 --> 18:18.257
But, um...

18:20.428 --> 18:24.564
you can't hate someone
who you loved for so long.

18:27.936 --> 18:30.136
[fires crackling]

18:36.411 --> 18:38.578
Okay...

18:45.787 --> 18:47.620
In order to be reborn,

18:48.556 --> 18:50.856
we must have a sacrifice.

18:50.858 --> 18:53.192
In order to be reborn,

18:53.194 --> 18:55.795
we must have faith.

18:55.797 --> 18:57.697
[sighs]

18:57.699 --> 18:59.198
This isn't right.

18:59.200 --> 19:00.967
This ritual is supposed to be performed

19:00.969 --> 19:03.369
by an elder of the French Quarter.

19:03.371 --> 19:05.404
I'm not an elder of the French Quarter.

19:05.406 --> 19:06.472
This is not my magic.

19:06.474 --> 19:08.817
You were the regent of all nine covens!

19:08.820 --> 19:11.512
My own mother, my wretched mother,

19:11.515 --> 19:12.786
recognized your mastery.

19:12.789 --> 19:15.081
And let us not forget,

19:15.083 --> 19:17.917
you were the one that was
selected by the Hollow itself.

19:17.919 --> 19:19.552
So whatever your doubts,

19:19.554 --> 19:21.587
whatever our differences,

19:21.589 --> 19:23.656
your gift is irrefutable.

19:23.658 --> 19:26.392
Now, you will make this

19:26.394 --> 19:28.961
your kind of magic.

19:30.898 --> 19:34.300
<i>Ut non zna samo bol.</i>

19:34.302 --> 19:37.436
[grunting]

19:37.438 --> 19:39.805
FREYA: It's done.

19:39.807 --> 19:43.109
I've broken through the last
of his protection spells.

19:43.111 --> 19:44.610
You should leave.

19:44.612 --> 19:45.645
Uh,

19:45.647 --> 19:46.712
I live here.

19:46.714 --> 19:47.913
Why don't you

19:47.916 --> 19:49.827
just kill the guy and
then help me clean up

19:49.830 --> 19:51.763
the two bodies that are
stashed in my bathroom.

19:51.766 --> 19:53.619
Look, Freya,

19:53.621 --> 19:55.354
I'm not gonna leave you alone in here

19:55.356 --> 19:57.060
with the Hollow's High Priest of Doom.

19:57.063 --> 19:58.424
Why?

19:58.426 --> 20:00.084
We're not friends.

20:00.087 --> 20:02.685
I'm the evil witch who hurt Davina

20:02.688 --> 20:04.697
and still has Marcel captive, remember?

20:06.566 --> 20:08.533
[exhales sharply]

20:08.536 --> 20:10.536
[footfalls receding]

20:10.538 --> 20:11.637
[sighs]

20:11.639 --> 20:13.539
DOMINIC: Let me guess.

20:14.976 --> 20:16.475
You got questions.

20:16.477 --> 20:18.145
As I understand it,

20:18.148 --> 20:21.547
your overlord needs to collect
four of her bones to be reborn.

20:21.549 --> 20:23.516
One of which, the Tunde Blade,

20:23.518 --> 20:24.817
you stole from my home.

20:24.819 --> 20:27.286
Where are the others?

20:27.288 --> 20:30.656
As long as I'm the only
one with the answers,

20:30.658 --> 20:32.458
you can't kill me.

20:32.460 --> 20:33.826
[gasping]

20:33.828 --> 20:34.860
[yelling]

20:34.862 --> 20:36.729
Magically induced cardiac arrest.

20:36.731 --> 20:37.863
[gasping]

20:37.865 --> 20:39.965
Just short of lethal.

20:39.967 --> 20:41.467
Where are the bones?

20:41.469 --> 20:43.436
[straining]: I don't know.

20:43.438 --> 20:45.676
If you won't give me what I want,

20:45.679 --> 20:47.713
then I'll have to take it.

20:48.176 --> 20:50.843
<i>Dic mihi, hva du vet.</i>

20:50.845 --> 20:52.411
[whispering voice]: <i>Apisi.</i>

20:52.413 --> 20:54.313
<i>Apisi.</i>

20:54.315 --> 20:57.349
[gasping]

20:57.351 --> 20:59.085
Apisi.

21:00.521 --> 21:02.188
What does it mean?

21:02.190 --> 21:04.428
Tell me or I'll just kill
you and ask someone else.

21:04.431 --> 21:05.930
[gasping]: The Apisi...

21:05.933 --> 21:07.700
they were the guardians who

21:07.703 --> 21:09.636
protected the bones in ancient times.

21:09.639 --> 21:11.038
It means nothing now.

21:11.041 --> 21:14.076
I don't have the information you want.

21:14.078 --> 21:16.111
- Well, then, we're done here.
- Wait!

21:17.715 --> 21:20.115
I do know one thing.

21:21.685 --> 21:24.786
I know where that Malraux wolf is

21:24.788 --> 21:27.189
right now.

21:27.191 --> 21:29.725
Keelin.

21:31.962 --> 21:34.062
Hey, I'm just leaving the Ninth now.

21:34.064 --> 21:36.465
I'll order you a hurricane.

21:42.673 --> 21:44.339
You're lying.

21:44.341 --> 21:45.774
You don't know anything about her.

21:45.776 --> 21:49.011
I know she's important to you.

21:50.414 --> 21:53.315
And I know the way you look at
her from across a crowded room.

21:53.317 --> 21:55.517
- [exclaims]
- [cries out]

21:59.023 --> 22:01.923
I was less than amused

22:01.925 --> 22:03.492
by your little boundary spell,

22:03.494 --> 22:05.494
so I sent my friends with instructions

22:05.496 --> 22:06.728
to kill your wolf friend.

22:06.730 --> 22:09.297
They're in the Ninth Ward now.

22:09.299 --> 22:11.733
In St. Theodora's Health Clinic.

22:16.073 --> 22:18.173
[loud grunt]

22:18.175 --> 22:20.442
[Keelin cries out]

22:22.012 --> 22:25.647
[indistinct chatter]

22:25.649 --> 22:28.316
[growling]

22:28.318 --> 22:30.685
[cries out]

22:30.687 --> 22:33.651
[laughing]

22:33.654 --> 22:36.388
Honestly, she might be dead already.

22:37.323 --> 22:39.724
But if you kill me,

22:39.727 --> 22:41.963
then you'll never find
out where her body is.

22:41.965 --> 22:44.599
- [exclaims]
- [cries out]

22:47.771 --> 22:50.105

[thunder rumbling]

23:33.011 --> 23:37.981
<i>Resisite Chonje vos élus.</i>

23:39.016 --> 23:41.350
I beseech you...

23:41.353 --> 23:44.387
accept this offering
as a sign of our faith.

23:44.389 --> 23:46.656
[thunder]

23:49.761 --> 23:51.661
[wind whooshing]

23:58.136 --> 23:59.869
What is this?

24:04.576 --> 24:06.342
What... what is this?

24:06.344 --> 24:07.510
They're angry!

24:07.512 --> 24:09.722
They won't accept the sacrifice.

24:09.725 --> 24:11.848
I told you this was not my magic...

24:11.850 --> 24:13.716
They hate you, and they hate me

24:13.718 --> 24:15.018
for helping you!

24:17.053 --> 24:18.452
[thunder]

24:20.091 --> 24:22.191
Okay.

24:23.762 --> 24:25.528
Maybe...

24:34.072 --> 24:36.205
Davina, baby, I'm so sorry.

24:36.207 --> 24:37.540
I really need your help.

Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

25:24.823 --> 25:27.356
[indistinct chatter]

25:33.098 --> 25:34.564
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey...

25:34.566 --> 25:36.065
are you okay?

25:36.067 --> 25:38.787
Yeah, fine. I'm meeting someone.

25:38.790 --> 25:40.669
Yeah, like a doctor?

25:40.672 --> 25:43.172
A friend. Uh, tall, blond, you know,

25:43.174 --> 25:45.942
mysterious old-school kind of vibe

25:45.944 --> 25:47.477
Did you see her come in?

25:48.480 --> 25:51.114
I'm gonna say good night to Hope.

25:53.855 --> 25:55.053
Hayley, wait.

25:59.824 --> 26:03.025
[laughter]

26:03.027 --> 26:05.561
Impressive boundary spell.

26:06.764 --> 26:08.097
Unfortunately, it only lasts

26:08.099 --> 26:09.899
as long as the witch who cast it.

26:10.935 --> 26:12.869
[crash above]

26:12.871 --> 26:14.971
Something's wrong. I have to go.

26:14.973 --> 26:16.839
No, wait, Hope.

26:16.841 --> 26:19.142
It's not safe.

26:20.345 --> 26:22.178
[gasps] No.

26:28.586 --> 26:30.486
Come on.

26:39.164 --> 26:41.330
Aah...

26:51.476 --> 26:52.909
[cries out]

26:55.313 --> 26:57.547
Marcel is in the tunnels. Find him!

26:57.549 --> 26:59.549
I need you to let me out of the circle.

26:59.551 --> 27:01.712
I can't. My dad will be mad.

27:01.715 --> 27:03.246
No, he won't. I'll keep you safe.

27:03.249 --> 27:05.588
I can protect myself,
and my mom and dad.

27:05.590 --> 27:07.352
I'm strong enough to stop the bad guys.

27:07.355 --> 27:09.892
I'm stronger than anybody thinks.

27:09.894 --> 27:11.394
Wait, Hope.

27:11.396 --> 27:12.828
I know you're strong, okay?

27:12.830 --> 27:15.865
That's how I know you
can let me out of here.

27:15.867 --> 27:17.490
I need you to trust me right now.

27:17.493 --> 27:19.168
Your dad rescued me.

27:19.170 --> 27:21.304
He raised me, and I knew
your mom when she was a baby.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.372
We're family.

27:23.374 --> 27:25.241
What does your mommy say about family?

27:25.243 --> 27:26.709
[thunder rolls]

27:26.711 --> 27:28.878
That we stick together,
always and forever.

27:28.880 --> 27:29.979
That's right.

27:29.981 --> 27:32.248
MAN: He's down here. Let's go.

27:32.250 --> 27:33.716
Okay, look at me.

27:37.055 --> 27:38.988
Do you trust me?

27:43.761 --> 27:45.795
Come on! [gasps]

27:46.731 --> 27:49.232
- Damn it, Freya!
- [coughing]

27:49.234 --> 27:50.366
- Hey.
- Hey.

27:50.368 --> 27:53.135
- You're okay.
- Yeah.

27:53.137 --> 27:56.005
Oh, you're okay.

27:56.007 --> 27:58.274
How long was I out for?

27:58.276 --> 28:00.743
Freya, your heart stopped beating.

28:00.745 --> 28:02.111
If my heart stopped,

28:02.114 --> 28:04.131
then the boundary
spell must have fallen.

28:04.134 --> 28:05.266
I have to go.

28:05.269 --> 28:07.410
No, you, you can't.

28:07.413 --> 28:09.183
I have to.

28:15.526 --> 28:18.461
The Hollow is gonna
have a feast tonight.

28:20.131 --> 28:23.099
We can sacrifice the whole family.

28:25.003 --> 28:27.036
Your daughter's around
here somewhere, isn't she?

28:28.973 --> 28:31.007
How convenient.

28:31.009 --> 28:32.642
[cries out]

28:38.816 --> 28:40.583
Hope!

28:40.585 --> 28:43.552
Hope?

28:44.656 --> 28:47.056
[thunder crashes]

29:09.140 --> 29:12.260
Davina, I haven't called
out to you in a lot of years.

29:12.263 --> 29:13.762
Because you couldn't hear me.

29:13.764 --> 29:15.164
But I think you can hear me now.

29:15.166 --> 29:17.833
I need your help with the Ancestors.

29:17.835 --> 29:19.368
What are you doing?

29:22.506 --> 29:25.908
If there's anything left of her,

29:25.910 --> 29:29.101
she can accept the sacrifice
and restore the link.

29:29.104 --> 29:30.270
Davina, I need you to help me

29:30.273 --> 29:32.481
bring those girls back over here.

29:32.483 --> 29:34.550
And then you and me, we
can, we can work together.

29:34.552 --> 29:36.785
I shouldn't be doing this ritual,

29:36.788 --> 29:38.331
because I lost faith in the Ancestors

29:38.334 --> 29:39.220
a long time ago,

29:39.223 --> 29:41.356
but I never once lost faith in you.

29:43.527 --> 29:45.627
Help.

29:49.233 --> 29:51.133
[thunder rolls]

29:52.970 --> 29:57.506
I know there's one
good heart over there.

29:57.508 --> 29:58.707
[earth rumbling]

29:58.709 --> 29:59.975
[thunder crashing]

30:02.813 --> 30:05.347
[wind whooshing]

30:16.460 --> 30:18.727
[screaming]

30:18.729 --> 30:21.797
[all gasping, panting]

30:27.671 --> 30:29.238
Klaus?

30:29.240 --> 30:31.006
Freya, it's Hayley.

30:35.145 --> 30:37.512
Her neck is broken. She'll heal.

30:37.514 --> 30:38.914
You should leave.

30:38.916 --> 30:41.383
I need to find my brother and my niece.

30:41.385 --> 30:43.695
- Well, let me help you.
- You're just getting in the way!

30:43.698 --> 30:45.187
- Freya...
- Leave!

30:45.189 --> 30:47.222
Please!

30:58.302 --> 31:00.469
[indistinct crowd chatter]

31:04.375 --> 31:06.375
Marcel!

31:09.950 --> 31:11.750
HOPE: Dad.

31:14.026 --> 31:15.225
What happened?

31:20.524 --> 31:21.963
It's, uh...

31:21.966 --> 31:24.199
it's, it's paint.

31:24.202 --> 31:26.094
I made quite a mess, didn't I?

31:28.399 --> 31:30.132
Where's Mom?

31:30.134 --> 31:31.933
She's at home,

31:31.935 --> 31:33.435
waiting for you.

31:33.437 --> 31:36.638
Are you okay?

31:36.640 --> 31:38.840
You took your bracelet off.

31:38.842 --> 31:40.409
Dad, don't be mad.

31:40.411 --> 31:41.977
I-I let Marcel out

31:41.979 --> 31:44.012
and he kept me safe.

31:44.848 --> 31:48.050
I'm not angry, sweetheart, come here.

31:48.052 --> 31:50.786
Don't be angry with Marcel, either.

31:51.622 --> 31:53.497
He's my friend.

32:03.380 --> 32:05.033
You are so lucky.

32:05.035 --> 32:07.402
Yes.

32:08.272 --> 32:09.671
We were.

32:09.673 --> 32:11.540
Elijah, let me ask you a question.

32:13.344 --> 32:15.877
Do you remember at all what
it's like to be a human being?

32:18.304 --> 32:20.071
Not really.

32:20.074 --> 32:22.851
'Cause you just put four
little girls' lives at risk.

32:22.853 --> 32:25.120
I'm trying, Vincent.

32:27.151 --> 32:28.789
Now, whatever happened tonight,

32:28.792 --> 32:30.025
we prevented the city

32:30.027 --> 32:31.241
from being destroyed.

32:31.244 --> 32:33.276
What happens if what we
did didn't work tonight?

32:34.498 --> 32:35.897
It did.

32:35.899 --> 32:38.800
But now we have an
ally against the Hollow.

32:38.802 --> 32:41.436
Yeah, Elijah. [sniffles]

32:41.438 --> 32:44.373
You are an infection on my city.

32:44.375 --> 32:46.908
You have absolutely no virtue

32:46.910 --> 32:49.144
and you have no value,
here or wherever it is

32:49.146 --> 32:50.712
that you decide to drag yourself next.

32:50.714 --> 32:52.547
I feel so sorry for that little girl,

32:52.549 --> 32:53.815
that she's got to be raised

32:53.817 --> 32:55.417
in a household with a punk like you.

32:55.419 --> 32:57.586
And I'm gonna be praying for her soul.

32:57.588 --> 33:00.288
Because I know you ain't got one.

33:04.795 --> 33:06.795
Elijah.

33:15.782 --> 33:18.316
KLAUS: Is she asleep?

33:18.318 --> 33:21.185
She was quiet when we walked home.

33:21.187 --> 33:25.156
She didn't exactly buy
your story about paint

33:25.158 --> 33:26.157
on your hand.

33:26.159 --> 33:28.159
When I think about the horror

33:28.161 --> 33:29.494
she must have witnessed

33:29.496 --> 33:31.229
when Marcel killed those men, it just...

33:31.231 --> 33:32.764
Um, no.

33:32.766 --> 33:35.433
She didn't see anything, actually.

33:35.435 --> 33:37.402
Marcel swept her away

33:37.404 --> 33:39.938
before she could even
understand what was going on.

33:39.940 --> 33:42.874
He told her to close her eyes and sing.

33:48.566 --> 33:50.615
She called him her friend.

33:50.617 --> 33:53.251
[laughs]

33:56.222 --> 33:57.855
[Hayley chuckles]

33:57.857 --> 33:59.791
[footfalls approaching]

34:02.195 --> 34:03.709
Rough day at the office?

34:03.712 --> 34:05.482
Vincent restored the link

34:05.485 --> 34:06.852
to the Ancestors.

34:06.854 --> 34:09.353
We now have the means to put the Hollow

34:09.356 --> 34:11.956
back in its cage.

34:11.958 --> 34:13.992
So, how was your day?

34:13.994 --> 34:18.096
Dominic had the name
of a werewolf bloodline:

34:18.098 --> 34:19.373
Apisi.

34:19.376 --> 34:21.466
They were entrusted to be
the guardians of a bone,

34:21.467 --> 34:22.766
like Hayley's family.

34:22.768 --> 34:24.502
I've been tracking the lineage

34:24.504 --> 34:26.471
and the last of the modern family

34:26.473 --> 34:27.672
died a couple years ago,

34:27.674 --> 34:30.675
under dubious circumstances.

34:33.981 --> 34:36.715
Tyler Lockwood.

34:38.202 --> 34:40.402
So the bones are in Mystic Falls.

34:48.562 --> 34:50.061
JOSH: What the hell happened?

34:51.197 --> 34:53.331
Josh, you ain't
supposed to be here, man.

34:53.333 --> 34:55.600
Yeah, vamp in witch territory, I know.

34:55.601 --> 34:57.736
I come to see her anyway, all the time.

34:57.738 --> 34:59.704
Now what happened to her grave?

35:00.540 --> 35:02.741
I needed help, so I...

35:02.743 --> 35:04.876
I made a sacrifice to the Ancestors.

35:04.878 --> 35:06.978
What? I...

35:06.981 --> 35:09.080
I thought the Ancestors
were the bad guys.

35:09.082 --> 35:10.448
Yeah, Josh, we need power

35:10.450 --> 35:12.050
if we're gonna contain the Hollow,

35:12.052 --> 35:14.653
so I called in some help
from one of our old friends

35:14.655 --> 35:16.788
and she came through for us, once again.

35:17.658 --> 35:19.190
You felt her?

35:19.192 --> 35:20.659
[sighing]: Yeah, Josh, I felt her.

35:20.661 --> 35:23.061
And it's gonna be different this time.

35:23.063 --> 35:24.539
I made her the gatekeeper

35:24.542 --> 35:26.031
for all the Ancestral magic

35:26.033 --> 35:27.899
that we got here in this city.

35:28.541 --> 35:30.207
So right now,

35:30.210 --> 35:33.144
Davina Claire is the most
important ally that we got.

35:45.659 --> 35:47.960
If you came to fight,

35:47.963 --> 35:49.888
it ain't gonna end well for you.

35:52.326 --> 35:54.459
I didn't come to fight.

35:55.696 --> 35:57.295
You told her

35:57.297 --> 35:59.664
to close her eyes and to sing.

36:01.201 --> 36:02.801
I used to say that

36:02.803 --> 36:04.002
when you were young.

36:04.004 --> 36:05.236
Yeah, well,

36:05.238 --> 36:08.106
she's a better listener than I was.

36:08.108 --> 36:09.375
You didn't tell her.

36:09.378 --> 36:10.742
About our history.

36:10.744 --> 36:11.753
Right, yeah.

36:11.756 --> 36:13.338
How dare I deny my daughter

36:13.341 --> 36:15.780
the heartwarming tale of
the boy I loved as a son...

36:15.782 --> 36:17.782
That is now the man you hate enough

36:17.784 --> 36:19.115
to keep locked in your basement.

36:19.118 --> 36:20.874
Yeah, but the thing is, we're not men,

36:20.877 --> 36:22.177
are we, Marcellus?

36:23.289 --> 36:24.922
We're monsters.
