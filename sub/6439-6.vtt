WEBVTT

00:48.799 --> 00:51.217
It is a heavy thing,

00:51.385 --> 00:54.971
to see a father
so strong in life unable to rise.

00:55.139 --> 00:57.557
The weight of it keenly felt.

00:57.725 --> 01:00.518
Titus was much loved by this city.

01:00.686 --> 01:02.895
Hold comfort in the knowledge.

01:11.113 --> 01:14.198
The magistrate himself pays respects?

01:14.366 --> 01:16.325
It's a great honor.

01:16.493 --> 01:18.745
For my father.

01:18.912 --> 01:21.706
Years I wished
for blistering tongue to cool,

01:21.874 --> 01:24.959
only to long for it
to scorch ear once more.

01:26.211 --> 01:29.130
I know you did not
wish him gone in such a manner.

01:29.298 --> 01:32.592
Nor did I,
despite our many differences.

01:32.760 --> 01:36.220
And yet the gods have willed it.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.973
The gods had no fucking hand in this.

01:39.141 --> 01:42.643
Tullius alone inflicts injury.

01:43.854 --> 01:46.814
And how shall it be answered?

01:46.982 --> 01:50.276
Apologies. Unwelcome guest
makes appearance.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.365
Vettius.

01:57.910 --> 02:00.161
Temper emotion and greet him
with measured voice.

02:00.329 --> 02:02.455
It would serve no purpose
to have confrontation

02:02.623 --> 02:04.582
here in front of the magistrate.

02:04.750 --> 02:07.210
Good Batiatus.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.213
My sympathies
for the passing of your father.

02:10.380 --> 02:14.091
A titan, standing far above
all who follow.

02:14.259 --> 02:15.301
You come absent Tullius?

02:15.469 --> 02:17.887
I thought nothing could keep the man
from observance of such a tragedy.

02:18.055 --> 02:21.307
Well, he confers with dignitaries
from Antioch.

02:21.475 --> 02:24.018
- Antioch?
- He's engaged in business there,

02:24.186 --> 02:26.437
to the further glory of the Republic.

02:26.605 --> 02:28.981
He sends his regrets
that he could not be present,

02:29.149 --> 02:31.651
and a reminder

02:31.819 --> 02:34.987
that a bargain was struck
with your father before he passed

02:35.155 --> 02:37.824
concerning the sale of Gannicus.

02:37.991 --> 02:41.494
You dare broach subject
on such a fucking day?

02:41.662 --> 02:45.623
We have respectfully waited
for eight of them to pass.

02:46.667 --> 02:49.627
Your period of mourning
comes to conclusion.

02:49.795 --> 02:52.004
Tomorrow the sun greets a ninth day

02:52.172 --> 02:54.632
and with it we expect
delivery of Gannicus.

02:54.800 --> 02:58.052
Turn desire to piss and shit

02:58.220 --> 03:00.555
and see yourself well satisfied.

03:00.722 --> 03:03.558
Then Tullius will be forced to withdraw
offer to include your men

03:03.725 --> 03:06.269
in the opening games
of the new arena.

03:06.436 --> 03:08.688
And all that follow.

03:20.742 --> 03:23.619
Titus condemns
our brothers to the mines.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.872
Now we fucking honor him?

03:26.039 --> 03:28.708
He was the dominus of this house

03:28.876 --> 03:30.835
and deserves no less.

03:31.003 --> 03:33.629
Spoken as a true champion.

04:00.824 --> 04:02.742
Apologies.

04:02.910 --> 04:04.869
Batiatus summons the men.

04:16.005 --> 04:18.591
You will see her ashes
beneath the ground?

04:19.718 --> 04:22.386
As is her people's custom.

04:23.555 --> 04:25.556
I did not know of them.

04:25.724 --> 04:29.101
There are many things
that I did not pause to ask of her.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.396
Now I'm but filled with questions.

04:32.564 --> 04:35.483
Speak of her in quiet moments

04:35.651 --> 04:37.777
and see them answered.

04:39.988 --> 04:42.448
Oenomaus...

04:45.494 --> 04:47.995
she was the rarest of women,

04:48.163 --> 04:53.626
a flower of beauty and compassion
in a world full of shit.

04:53.794 --> 04:59.090
I would assume her place, so that her
laugh may once again fill solemn air.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.801
She would not wish it.

05:04.346 --> 05:06.847
She loved you.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.851
As a brother.

05:11.019 --> 05:14.230
As I loved her.

05:19.111 --> 05:23.239
We stand upon sacred ground,
watered with tears of blood.

05:23.407 --> 05:27.451
Words I have often heard in my youth...
by my father,

05:27.619 --> 05:30.538
by his father before him.

05:30.706 --> 05:33.958
Yet only now
do I truly understand them.

05:35.377 --> 05:38.212
We've all felt
the bitter sting of loss.

05:39.256 --> 05:41.132
Yet here we stand.

05:42.843 --> 05:47.513
We have known the agony of heart
ripped yet beating from sundered chest.

05:47.681 --> 05:51.809
And yet here we stand.

05:51.977 --> 05:55.479
The House of Batiatus
is no stranger to misfortune,

05:55.647 --> 05:57.982
to the cruel whims of the gods

05:58.150 --> 06:00.735
and base men who would position
themselves as such.

06:00.902 --> 06:04.030
And yet here we stand!

06:06.825 --> 06:10.244
This house is built
atop unshakable foundations

06:10.412 --> 06:13.330
of honor and respect.

06:13.498 --> 06:17.334
And in no man were
these qualities more evident

06:17.502 --> 06:21.047
than Titus Lentulus Batiatus.

06:21.214 --> 06:24.133
I will laud my father's memory

06:24.301 --> 06:26.135
by seeing the House of Batiatus

06:26.303 --> 06:29.722
elevated beyond the imaginings
of my ancestors.

06:29.890 --> 06:32.641
I will need all of you to see it done...

06:32.809 --> 06:36.228
men of hard purpose and desire.

06:36.396 --> 06:39.607
Let previous decisions fall aside.

06:39.775 --> 06:43.944
None of you will be sent to the mines,
regardless of standing!

06:50.660 --> 06:52.787
The sun has set on an era.

06:52.954 --> 06:57.333
Let us celebrate the name
Titus Lentulus Batiatus

06:57.501 --> 07:02.963
with drink and the clash of swords
to carry my father to the afterlife!

07:08.136 --> 07:10.387
Take position!

07:12.849 --> 07:15.768
Will you fight your man to conclusion
or drop your defense

07:15.936 --> 07:19.146
and allow for hollow victory,
as you did with me before Titus?

07:19.314 --> 07:23.400
You are champion now.
Do not broach fucking subject again.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.946
Spill blood upon the sands, but live

07:27.114 --> 07:31.784
to one day die with glory
and honor in the arena!

07:54.182 --> 07:55.307
Begin.

08:37.893 --> 08:40.059
This is all that remains...

08:40.227 --> 08:43.688
when the smoke clears
and the embers die...

08:46.026 --> 08:48.819
the sum total of a man's life.

08:54.201 --> 08:59.079
This was my father's last act
before his death:

08:59.247 --> 09:01.665
A bill of sale transferring
your ownership.

09:02.959 --> 09:05.211
The cause that moved you
to seek audience on the day

09:05.378 --> 09:07.963
- I watched my father burn?
- Apologies, Dominus.

09:08.131 --> 09:10.049
I could wait no longer.

09:12.510 --> 09:16.222
We again find ourselves
in unpleasant position.

09:17.933 --> 09:21.852
To honor my father's wishes sees you
fall to control of a man most hated,

09:22.020 --> 09:25.272
to defy them sees this house
forever excluded from the new arena.

09:25.440 --> 09:28.150
A cock in the ass,
from either direction.

09:29.736 --> 09:33.197
Speak, and give reason to see
this join my father's ashes.

09:33.365 --> 09:35.407
I have no words towards such an end.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.743
I come to see agreement honored.

09:40.372 --> 09:42.289
You wish to leave this house?

09:42.457 --> 09:44.667
I wish to see blood.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.794
See me delivered to Tullius's care

09:46.962 --> 09:49.421
and I will see his life
for your father's.

09:50.548 --> 09:52.383
Noble offer.

09:52.550 --> 09:55.886
Yet I fear your life would be
forfeit in such attempt.

09:56.054 --> 09:58.722
A small price to pay.

09:59.724 --> 10:03.519
My father never aimed
a favored word towards you,

10:03.687 --> 10:06.605
yet you entreat to be the instrument
of his vengeance?

10:08.191 --> 10:10.234
Or is it another you seek it for?

10:14.114 --> 10:17.283
You would sacrifice your life
in the memory of hers?

10:17.450 --> 10:20.202
I would sacrifice a thousand,
if I'd but had them.

10:21.955 --> 10:23.831
If you had such
stirrings for Melitta,

10:23.999 --> 10:27.209
why did you not fight harder
in the contest before my father?

10:27.377 --> 10:29.962
You could have taken Crixus
and remained here,

10:30.130 --> 10:31.672
close to your heart's desires.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.966
The match was lost
before sword was ever raised.

10:34.134 --> 10:36.214
The same could be said
of your plans against Tullius.

10:36.303 --> 10:38.470
He is forever surrounded
not only by his own men,

10:38.638 --> 10:42.016
but by good citizens who would quickly
come to the aid of such a "noble" Roman.

10:42.183 --> 10:45.102
- Then they too shall fall.
- You do not fucking think!

10:45.270 --> 10:49.648
This grants ownership
to Tullius' lapdog Vettius.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.318
You'll be sent to the boy's Ludus
in fucking Nola.

10:52.485 --> 10:55.321
A year could pass before you find
yourself close enough to Tullius.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.115
I would suffer a lifetime
but to have the chance to strike.

10:58.283 --> 11:00.784
This house would be
the one that suffers!

11:00.952 --> 11:03.829
A year of the greatest gladiator
in the Republic

11:03.997 --> 11:07.082
fighting for those shits!?
A year of you needing to win

11:07.250 --> 11:09.752
each fight against my fucking men

11:09.919 --> 11:14.214
in the hopes of gaining
an audience with Tullius.

11:14.382 --> 11:17.926
Will he not wish to see the man
he has fought so hard to gain

11:18.094 --> 11:21.055
- when so delivered?
- In chains, absent weapons.

11:21.222 --> 11:23.265
Then I will use my hands!

11:23.433 --> 11:25.768
Your desires are well noted.

11:27.354 --> 11:30.272
I will weigh argument and come
to an answer in the balance.

11:32.359 --> 11:34.443
Dominus.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.618
Fetch more wine.

11:44.329 --> 11:46.372
Vettius's appearance was ill-timed.

11:46.539 --> 11:49.208
He is a dog,
untrained where not to shit.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.419
The hand that grips his leash
is of greater concern.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.922
Has Quintus voiced thought
towards Tullius?

11:55.090 --> 11:56.715
He has not.

11:57.967 --> 12:02.262
Yet what would any of us do to see
the death of one so loved avenged?

12:02.430 --> 12:05.015
The very heart of my concern.

12:05.183 --> 12:08.143
To take action against Tullius is
to invite mortal consequence.

12:08.311 --> 12:11.231
He has made repeated attacks against
this house. You'd have us do nothing?

12:11.272 --> 12:12.898
I would have you live.

12:13.066 --> 12:16.777
If the situation with Tullius turns
to further disadvantage,

12:16.945 --> 12:20.114
know that you may always
seek refuge beneath my roof.

12:23.535 --> 12:26.829
- As friend.
- Where is the fucking wine?

12:26.996 --> 12:30.082
Naevia brings more.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.583
I should take my leave.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.919
No stay.
I would have your counsel.

12:34.087 --> 12:36.797
Gannicus presses to honor
terms towards his sale.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.466
- Then the matter is resolved.
- Fuck resolution.

12:39.634 --> 12:41.802
The man only desires
close proximity to Tullius

12:41.970 --> 12:43.650
and the villain's throat
beneath his hands.

12:43.763 --> 12:47.224
He would kill Tullius for us?
Do you believe it possible?

12:47.392 --> 12:49.017
You speak of madness!

12:49.185 --> 12:51.812
Tullius is far too cautious
to ever lower guard,

12:51.980 --> 12:55.274
especially in the presence of a man
loyal to the House of Batiatus.

12:55.442 --> 12:57.860
And what would brave Solonius
do in my fucking position?!

12:58.027 --> 13:00.237
Turn blind eye towards
the murder of his father?

13:00.405 --> 13:03.073
He would be certain
to strike appropriate target.

13:03.241 --> 13:05.909
What if Tullius had no hand in this?

13:06.077 --> 13:08.078
His gift of wine was tainted with death.

13:08.246 --> 13:12.332
But was it by Tullius's hand?
Or another moved by equal grievance?

13:12.500 --> 13:15.294
What if Vettius is
the true cause of this?

13:15.462 --> 13:17.463
The boy's hatred for you
is well known.

13:18.715 --> 13:19.882
You are right.

13:20.049 --> 13:22.929
Vengeance would stand a hollow vessel
were it not filled with retribution

13:23.094 --> 13:26.597
against all who have injured this house,
including young Vettius.

13:26.764 --> 13:29.266
- You twist my intention.
- He but straightens purpose.

13:29.434 --> 13:31.768
Is this not what set tragedy in motion?

13:31.936 --> 13:34.855
Arrogance and impatience?
You're forever reaching beyond grasp,

13:35.023 --> 13:37.065
and dragging those beside you
as you fall.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.151
And you have never had
the stomach to do what it takes

13:39.319 --> 13:40.944
to make a fucking
name in this world!

13:41.112 --> 13:44.406
Good Solonius, forever bowing
and scraping in the shit of his betters.

13:44.574 --> 13:47.159
Is it any wonder no woman
would have you?

13:47.327 --> 13:49.870
Emotion carries us beyond reason.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.414
Solonius has been as a brother to us.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.752
It has been a trying day
in a long succession of many.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.588
Apologies.

13:59.756 --> 14:02.508
I have asked much of our friendship,
with little reward.

14:02.675 --> 14:05.636
Yet I must seek more

14:05.803 --> 14:08.889
if we are to see injuries
against our house redressed.

14:12.852 --> 14:14.228
What are your thoughts?

14:14.395 --> 14:16.813
They yet stand clouded.

14:16.981 --> 14:19.983
Come. Let us put our minds together
and see them cleared.

14:41.839 --> 14:44.841
This mark carries great honor,

14:45.009 --> 14:48.428
and even greater responsibility.

14:49.472 --> 14:53.016
Melitta held many years
as my body slave...

14:54.811 --> 14:58.146
and shall be missed
beyond the measure of words.

15:01.859 --> 15:05.153
I expect equal loyalty from you now.

15:05.321 --> 15:09.533
You are always to stand by my side,
never to leave it.

15:09.701 --> 15:12.661
Or this house, as Diona chose.

15:14.330 --> 15:16.790
Oh, I understand why she fled.

15:18.376 --> 15:22.963
It was an unfortunate thing to be
so used by men for base entertainment.

15:23.131 --> 15:26.341
I understand it,
yet cannot forgive.

15:26.509 --> 15:29.136
Yes, Domina.

15:31.055 --> 15:35.934
What I can do is make promise

15:36.102 --> 15:39.563
that no one will ever
lay hands upon you for sport.

15:39.731 --> 15:43.442
Your maidenhood will be
preserved as a precious gift

15:43.610 --> 15:45.485
and given only to the most worthy,

15:45.653 --> 15:47.738
as Melitta was given to Oenomaus.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.292
There.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.628
We are forever
bound to each other.

16:02.795 --> 16:04.838
Bring oil and a sharpened blade.

16:05.006 --> 16:07.049
I would be rid
of this fucking beard.

16:07.216 --> 16:08.592
Solonius?

16:08.760 --> 16:10.844
Courage hardened
and hands set to task.

16:11.012 --> 16:12.721
Then you've come to decision.

16:12.889 --> 16:14.973
One that not even good Tullius
will see coming.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.059
Gather my father's ashes
and tell Oenomaus

16:17.226 --> 16:19.436
to prepare Gannicus
to leave these walls.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.667
Brother.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.252
You are too late.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.213
I have finished the wine.

16:46.381 --> 16:50.509
Would that I had enough
to sink to the fucking bottom.

16:55.098 --> 16:58.392
Dominus orders you
prepared for transport.

16:58.559 --> 17:00.602
I am to be sold then?

17:00.770 --> 17:02.854
What seizes Batiatus...

17:03.022 --> 17:05.440
to give you to Tullius
after what he has done?

17:05.608 --> 17:08.193
The man has lost fucking sense.

17:08.361 --> 17:10.069
Then question mine as well.

17:10.238 --> 17:12.614
You wish this?

17:12.781 --> 17:15.282
I wish to stand before Tullius

17:15.451 --> 17:17.618
and have his fucking life.

17:17.787 --> 17:20.914
You would have better chance
flinging yourself from the cliff

17:21.082 --> 17:22.874
and praying to land upon him.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.917
It was his fucking wine.

17:25.086 --> 17:26.795
If she had...

17:29.298 --> 17:31.758
all those who had hand
in her passing must pay,

17:31.926 --> 17:34.094
regardless of cost.

17:38.391 --> 17:43.979
It was a gift for
Titus... Tullius's wine.

17:44.147 --> 17:47.023
How did it come to pass her lips?
She was no thief.

17:47.191 --> 17:49.568
What answer would matter now?

17:49.736 --> 17:52.195
She is gone and the men
that took her soon to follow.

17:52.363 --> 17:55.949
I would rather you join her now than see
another so close to me fall to Tullius.

17:56.117 --> 17:57.743
The choice is removed from your hands.

17:57.910 --> 18:00.954
- I will break words with Batiatus.
- Oenomaus, this is how it must be.

18:01.122 --> 18:03.290
She would not have wanted this.

18:05.209 --> 18:07.794
When I meet her in the afterlife,

18:07.962 --> 18:13.049
I do not wish to explain why I allowed
a man we both loved to forfeit his life.

18:14.802 --> 18:17.846
I have lost my wife.

18:20.433 --> 18:23.226
I do not want to see
my brother follow.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.106
He deserves no less.

18:33.821 --> 18:37.032
Oenomaus... The time
for words has passed.

18:38.659 --> 18:40.202
- Dominus.
- Prepare the wagon.

18:40.369 --> 18:42.704
We leave at once.

18:52.048 --> 18:54.007
What words were you
about to fucking speak?

18:54.175 --> 18:56.343
- Ones weighted with truth.
- Towards what purpose?

18:56.511 --> 18:57.636
He deserves to know.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.971
This is not about him.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.974
It is about Gannicus
and his fucking conscience.

19:03.142 --> 19:06.978
Speak it, and see memory
of beloved wife forever tainted.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.481
I cannot keep buried
what I have done.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.150
Then see it remain in shallow grave
but a while longer.

19:12.318 --> 19:16.363
How am I to unearth it
once I have been sold to Tullius?

19:16.531 --> 19:21.326
I do not sell you to fucking Tullius.

19:26.541 --> 19:28.792
Batiatus again spits in my face?

19:28.960 --> 19:30.877
News absent surprise.

19:31.045 --> 19:34.339
A snake by nature favors
maneuvering upon its belly.

19:34.507 --> 19:37.133
I would stand upright
among honorable men.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.638
Where does he take Gannicus?

19:41.806 --> 19:43.932
Batiatus sent me to secure sale

19:44.100 --> 19:46.059
to the Syrian trader Galeagra.

19:46.227 --> 19:49.813
By morning Gannicus will be on a ship
sailing towards points unknown,

19:49.981 --> 19:52.232
forever beyond your reach.

19:52.400 --> 19:56.027
You aided Batiatus in this?

19:56.195 --> 19:58.029
I have known the man for many years.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.948
I was conflicted.

20:00.116 --> 20:01.491
As am I...

20:03.536 --> 20:06.496
on whether to strip flesh
from your fucking face.

20:06.664 --> 20:08.373
Wait! I came to you with this.

20:08.541 --> 20:09.541
After the fact.

20:09.709 --> 20:12.878
There is still time. He meets the Syrian
at the edge of the city.

20:16.883 --> 20:18.383
Gather the men.

20:20.011 --> 20:23.096
I cannot believe even Batiatus so thick

20:23.264 --> 20:25.682
as to imagine concealing such an act.

20:25.850 --> 20:28.602
He will spin the story
of Gannicus escaping...

20:28.769 --> 20:32.355
to perhaps follow his slave girl Diona,
who recently went to foot.

20:32.523 --> 20:35.609
He thinks me the fool,
to accept the tale?

20:35.776 --> 20:39.029
Batiatus knows you will summon him
to meeting to discuss the matter.

20:39.196 --> 20:42.198
He lays plans to see much coin
in your men's hands,

20:42.366 --> 20:46.286
payment in aid against your life
when he stands before you.

20:46.454 --> 20:49.331
The fucking cock on him.

20:53.586 --> 20:56.713
Batiatus has always thought himself
above those around him...

20:56.881 --> 20:59.507
even closest friend.

21:01.469 --> 21:04.054
I shall prove the notion false

21:04.221 --> 21:08.350
and see fucking son join his father.

21:25.159 --> 21:27.160
Where are they?

21:27.328 --> 21:28.828
I'll search ahead.

21:28.996 --> 21:32.123
Stay where you are. I will not
have you from my fucking side.

21:32.291 --> 21:35.543
If you had sold me to Tullius,
no one else's life would be at risk.

21:35.711 --> 21:37.963
With great risk comes great reward.

21:38.130 --> 21:39.798
And I would have mine.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.636
The Syrians arrive.

21:52.103 --> 21:55.981
I grow weary
of these games, Batiatus,

21:56.148 --> 21:59.526
and would see them to bitter end.

21:59.694 --> 22:01.653
As would l.

22:15.751 --> 22:20.630
Come. Let us embrace,
you fucking cunt.

22:25.094 --> 22:27.303
Come on!

22:57.209 --> 22:59.294
Ashur!

23:00.963 --> 23:02.922
Fucking kill him, Barca!

23:09.346 --> 23:11.222
You!

23:11.390 --> 23:14.684
Fuck you, you fucking shit.
You fuck!

23:28.949 --> 23:30.075
Wait, hold!

23:31.077 --> 23:33.244
I said hold.

23:37.416 --> 23:41.044
Such a death would be far too quick.

23:43.714 --> 23:45.882
Bind him.

23:53.390 --> 23:55.934
And you.

23:58.521 --> 24:01.731
You played your part
to fucking perfection!

24:04.485 --> 24:07.904
It was not difficult. When passion
for vengeance overtakes caution,

24:08.072 --> 24:10.657
even the keenest of minds
is easily deceived.

24:10.825 --> 24:12.492
Modest to the fucking last.

24:12.660 --> 24:15.411
See these bodies put to grass
and get yourself to the medicus.

24:15.579 --> 24:17.122
You're sure to your purpose?

24:17.289 --> 24:19.749
My path has never been clearer.

24:22.128 --> 24:24.170
Good Tullius.

24:26.507 --> 24:28.383
Let us have final words

24:28.551 --> 24:30.844
before you depart this life.

24:39.937 --> 24:42.605
Ah, the lamb finally wakes.

24:42.773 --> 24:45.692
Calm yourself.

24:45.860 --> 24:48.194
I merely wish to break words.

24:49.947 --> 24:52.240
Seek to raise alarm
and find throat slit

24:52.408 --> 24:54.993
well in advance of aid.
We are clear?

25:00.583 --> 25:02.625
You are fucking dead.

25:02.793 --> 25:06.171
Threats absent form
without Tullius to support them.

25:06.338 --> 25:09.007
What have you done to him?

25:09.175 --> 25:11.050
Not me. I have done nothing.

25:11.218 --> 25:15.096
In all of this, I have never known
quarrel with good Tullius.

25:15.264 --> 25:18.933
Yet Batiatus...
he is of a contrary nature.

25:19.101 --> 25:22.812
And moves even as we speak
to end his conflict with your man.

25:22.980 --> 25:24.522
Forever.

25:24.690 --> 25:26.733
The opening of the arena is upon us.

25:26.901 --> 25:31.029
Tullius' absence will be noted,
and your part in it quick upon heel.

25:31.197 --> 25:35.491
You are mistaken. No one will suspect
Tullius has left this world...

25:35.659 --> 25:39.120
not when trusted Vettius heralds news
that he has unexpectedly

25:39.288 --> 25:43.166
set sail abroad to tend
to pressing matters in Antioch.

25:43.334 --> 25:46.252
What would move tongue
to voice such fucking lie?

25:46.420 --> 25:50.048
It would more easily forms words
to see you and Batiatus

25:50.216 --> 25:51.883
executed for your crimes.

25:52.051 --> 25:54.177
Based upon what evidence?

25:54.345 --> 25:57.388
We were not found knife in hand,
kneeling beside body.

25:57.556 --> 26:01.851
A body which even now Batiatus
conceals beyond reach of human eyes.

26:02.019 --> 26:06.481
No, my concern rests
with your safety.

26:08.442 --> 26:10.944
Attempt to raise
unwarranted suspicion,

26:11.111 --> 26:14.697
and Batiatus would be sure
to take offense.

26:14.865 --> 26:17.575
And without Tullius
to protect you...

26:20.287 --> 26:24.040
Ah. Youth finally matures.

26:25.709 --> 26:27.293
Now we have settled issue,

26:27.461 --> 26:30.755
let us turn to other matters
of a more personal nature.

26:35.427 --> 26:37.345
All things change.

26:37.513 --> 26:41.099
What we hold close to our hearts
eventually pass from this world.

26:44.353 --> 26:47.272
And what we once
turned from in disgust...

26:48.983 --> 26:50.733
we embrace as necessity.

26:54.989 --> 26:56.489
Raise your eyes.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.744
What do you see?

27:01.912 --> 27:03.663
The domina of the house.

27:03.831 --> 27:05.707
Is that all?

27:05.874 --> 27:08.418
I see a woman

27:08.585 --> 27:10.545
unlike any I have seen before.

27:11.588 --> 27:13.381
Better.

27:13.549 --> 27:16.050
I did not think I had pleased you

27:16.218 --> 27:19.012
when last called to your chambers.

27:20.931 --> 27:23.725
I love my husband beyond all men

27:23.892 --> 27:27.478
and I would do anything for him

27:27.646 --> 27:30.356
and his legacy.

27:33.694 --> 27:37.155
I did not seek pleasure.
I need only your cock.

27:37.323 --> 27:40.992
But speak of this and see it
parted from your body.

27:48.375 --> 27:50.335
Yes, Domina.

27:51.837 --> 27:55.381
Your hair and your beard

27:55.549 --> 27:58.426
give the appearance
of a fucking animal.

27:58.594 --> 28:01.471
I would have you reformed
into the semblance of a man

28:01.638 --> 28:05.266
to make the lie I must tell myself
more convincing.

28:44.390 --> 28:46.307
A game well played, Batiatus.

28:46.475 --> 28:51.020
Now let us come to terms.

28:53.148 --> 28:56.359
Your man Gannicus obviously
means a great deal to you,

28:56.527 --> 28:59.320
to press to such extremes.

28:59.488 --> 29:02.949
I will cease my pursuit of him.

29:03.117 --> 29:04.367
Offer more.

29:04.535 --> 29:07.578
I will see your house take prominence
in all upcoming games.

29:07.746 --> 29:09.956
More.

29:10.124 --> 29:12.375
Speak desire and see it attended.

29:12.543 --> 29:14.836
I desire to see you suffer

29:15.003 --> 29:17.463
as I have suffered
at your fucking hands.

29:17.631 --> 29:20.466
Your suffering
has only begun, Lanista,

29:20.634 --> 29:23.678
when it is discovered
what you have done to me!

29:23.846 --> 29:26.806
You will not be discovered,
nor missed.

29:26.974 --> 29:29.100
Solonius moves young Vettius

29:29.268 --> 29:32.770
towards offering proper explanation
for your disappearance.

29:32.938 --> 29:34.063
Vettius?

29:34.231 --> 29:36.441
Oh, the city will mourn.

29:36.608 --> 29:39.610
Soon your name will be
spoken of less and less,

29:39.778 --> 29:42.530
until it is lost to history.

29:42.698 --> 29:47.285
I should have had your life
at the beginning of this.

29:47.453 --> 29:51.581
The mistake is mine,
having stayed hand

29:51.748 --> 29:53.958
in respect of your father.

29:54.126 --> 29:55.668
Respect?

30:03.719 --> 30:06.888
Pay it to the remains
of the man himself.

30:07.890 --> 30:10.183
Tell him! Tell him

30:10.350 --> 30:13.644
how high you hold him
even as your poisoned wine

30:13.812 --> 30:17.690
robbed him of fucking life!
Tell him. Tell him, you fucking shit!

30:19.026 --> 30:22.695
Why should I strike against your father?

30:22.863 --> 30:25.448
He was an honorable Roman...

30:26.742 --> 30:29.535
a man who knew his place.

30:29.703 --> 30:32.246
As I know yours.

30:32.414 --> 30:36.042
There will be an accounting, Batiatus...

30:38.128 --> 30:41.506
for this and everything that follows.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.593
The gods will see to it someday.

30:45.761 --> 30:48.429
Yes, but not this one.

31:43.652 --> 31:46.821
This arena was your life...

31:46.989 --> 31:48.489
add to its foundations.

32:14.391 --> 32:16.726
Capua!

32:22.608 --> 32:25.109
Have eyes ever beheld such a sight?

32:25.277 --> 32:27.528
The laurel crown of the Republic.

32:27.696 --> 32:30.656
Its majesty even more evident
when viewed from the pulvinus.

32:30.824 --> 32:33.326
Oh, a great honor
to be invited by Tullius.

32:33.493 --> 32:37.163
One I fear undeserved, yet he is
a difficult man to turn from, huh?

32:37.331 --> 32:40.541
A fact well known to all present.

32:40.709 --> 32:42.376
I am surprised by his delay.

32:42.544 --> 32:44.670
The opening of the arena has been
the only subject on his tongue.

32:44.838 --> 32:47.173
Now he stands late
to his own celebration.

32:55.057 --> 32:56.891
Apologies.

32:57.059 --> 33:01.062
Tullius regrets
he will be absent altogether.

33:01.229 --> 33:04.065
What could wrest him
from so high a perch?

33:04.232 --> 33:06.525
Pressing concerns
abroad in Antioch.

33:06.693 --> 33:09.779
His departure was unexpected.

33:09.946 --> 33:12.865
The arena
would not exist without Tullius.

33:13.033 --> 33:15.951
We would not be standing here
if it weren't for his actions.

33:16.119 --> 33:18.537
We should halt the celebrations
until his return.

33:18.705 --> 33:20.498
Agreed.
I shall address the crowd.

33:20.666 --> 33:23.834
No, Tullius sends hard instruction
for ceremony to carry without him.

33:25.379 --> 33:27.922
This arena was a gift
to his beloved city.

33:28.090 --> 33:32.301
He would not see misfortune
stand in the way of the giving of it.

33:32.469 --> 33:36.889
A most gracious offer,
well received. Come.

33:37.057 --> 33:40.393
Haunt Tullius' place by my side,
possessing his spirit for the occasion.

33:40.560 --> 33:42.603
Again I must offer apology.

33:42.771 --> 33:45.690
I make preparations
to follow Tullius to Antioch.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.317
And what of your ventures here?
Your Ludus?

33:48.485 --> 33:51.654
I am retiring from the lowly
call of the Lanista

33:51.822 --> 33:56.367
in favor of station more
befitting a man of breeding.

33:56.535 --> 33:59.245
What will become of your men?
They fight this very day.

33:59.413 --> 34:02.039
I would not see
your brief labors turn to naught.

34:02.207 --> 34:05.459
Solonius and I can make
fair offer to divide them.

34:05.627 --> 34:07.878
Deeply appreciated,
yet unnecessary.

34:08.045 --> 34:10.965
Solonius and I have already
come to terms.

34:11.132 --> 34:12.591
Terms?

34:12.759 --> 34:16.637
I've transferred deed
to all my gladiators to Solonius,

34:16.804 --> 34:19.931
under whose noble banner
they will fight this day.

34:20.100 --> 34:22.518
You are indeed blessed, Solonius.

34:22.686 --> 34:26.313
Well, your Ludus now stands
above all others in sheer numbers.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.357
May the gods continue to show favor.

34:28.525 --> 34:31.152
- Huh.
- I must take my leave.

34:31.319 --> 34:34.989
Give good Solonius all consideration
towards future games.

34:35.157 --> 34:38.826
Tullius and I will have it so.

34:41.036 --> 34:43.706
You are overly generous.
Come. I would see you away.

34:48.043 --> 34:50.004
The boy all but runs from us.

34:53.967 --> 34:57.178
Vettius has always been
little more than Tullius' pet.

34:57.345 --> 35:00.347
Is it any wonder he runs to heel
when leash is jerked?

35:00.515 --> 35:02.475
Batiatus speaks truth.

35:02.642 --> 35:04.810
Let us put absent friends from mind

35:04.978 --> 35:07.438
and turn towards
the glories of the day.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.071
You have done well.

35:16.239 --> 35:18.199
I but dance to the yank of strings.

35:18.366 --> 35:20.159
Avoid them forming a noose,

35:20.327 --> 35:23.245
and never return to Capua
while I draw breath.

35:23.413 --> 35:25.831
I pray for the day it ceases.

35:28.251 --> 35:30.503
We were supposed to divide
Vettius' men among us.

35:30.670 --> 35:32.213
What the fuck are you doing?

35:32.380 --> 35:34.840
What it takes to make
a name in this world...

35:35.008 --> 35:37.885
after years of
"bowing and scraping in shit."

35:38.053 --> 35:41.388
Is that what this is about? A few words
spoken in anger absent thought?

35:41.556 --> 35:42.932
A few words?

35:43.099 --> 35:45.184
You name me friend and brother,

35:45.352 --> 35:48.312
yet at every turn remind
that I lack this trait or that.

35:48.480 --> 35:51.732
You take information given in aid
and move against Tullius,

35:51.900 --> 35:55.027
absent regard of the difficult
position it places me.

35:55.195 --> 35:56.695
You talk of nothing!

35:56.863 --> 35:59.532
Every tongue that is not your own
is accused of the same.

35:59.699 --> 36:02.159
It has taken years

36:02.327 --> 36:05.579
and the price of blood, but at last
I see you for what you are...

36:05.747 --> 36:09.458
a man who holds no one
in esteem beyond himself.

36:11.127 --> 36:12.920
I owe you gratitude.

36:13.088 --> 36:15.214
Without you to show the way,

36:15.382 --> 36:18.384
I would never have raised the nerve
to betray those closest to me.

36:31.815 --> 36:33.566
What excuse does Solonius give?

36:33.733 --> 36:36.151
None that merit consideration.

36:40.115 --> 36:41.907
What has the crowd in such a state?

36:42.075 --> 36:45.327
Sextus announces executions
before the games begin.

37:05.765 --> 37:08.183
Is that not one of yours, Batiatus?

37:08.351 --> 37:12.146
The girl on the end.
What was her name?

37:17.068 --> 37:19.403
Diona.

37:23.241 --> 37:26.243
Diona, yes.

37:26.411 --> 37:28.245
Apologies, Batiatus.

37:28.413 --> 37:30.539
The girl was only
rounded up this morning.

37:30.707 --> 37:33.459
If you wish her removed
to be dealt with personally...

37:35.295 --> 37:38.672
No, let her death stand
as a warning

37:38.840 --> 37:41.258
to all others who would
seek to betray me.

37:52.354 --> 37:55.731
Caburus is your man now,
Solonius.

37:55.899 --> 37:58.275
Rise and see him to purpose.

37:58.443 --> 38:00.110
As you wish.

39:30.410 --> 39:35.998
Pity, to lose one so...
fetching.

39:36.166 --> 39:38.417
Soon you join cunt.

39:41.046 --> 39:43.672
Doctore!

39:45.175 --> 39:48.093
I can fight.
Have word with Dominus.

39:50.472 --> 39:52.306
I already have.

39:52.474 --> 39:54.683
Now aid your brothers
in preparing for the day.

39:54.851 --> 39:57.811
You will fight again
when you are able.

39:57.979 --> 40:00.147
Yes, Doctore.

40:06.946 --> 40:10.949
You will face Tasgetius and Synetos
in the match before the primus.

40:13.244 --> 40:15.120
Our days have been filled.

40:15.288 --> 40:18.957
Show all of Capua why you are
considered such a prize.

40:19.125 --> 40:22.127
Fight, and honor
the House of Batiatus.

40:22.295 --> 40:24.505
There are many things
I would die for...

40:24.672 --> 40:27.883
many things
I deserve to die for...

40:28.051 --> 40:31.595
yet this house
is no longer among them.

40:31.763 --> 40:34.098
Then fight for her.

40:35.683 --> 40:38.727
Every life you take,
the blood you shed,

40:38.895 --> 40:41.522
she will see it
from the afterlife.

40:46.194 --> 40:48.403
Then I shall fill her eyes.

40:52.367 --> 40:53.951
Crixus!

40:54.119 --> 40:55.619
You are first.

40:55.787 --> 40:57.412
Ready.

41:12.262 --> 41:14.429
The sands have been moistened

41:14.597 --> 41:17.224
with our first offerings of blood.

41:17.392 --> 41:20.894
But more is demanded
on such a day.

41:21.062 --> 41:23.939
And you shall have it!

41:26.359 --> 41:28.986
The Houses of Solonius and Batiatus

41:29.154 --> 41:32.447
will battle each other
in deadly contest.

41:32.615 --> 41:34.825
No mercy shown.

41:34.993 --> 41:37.035
No quarter given.

41:37.203 --> 41:41.999
The victors all to face each
in the primus!

41:48.339 --> 41:51.967
You will school that little shit
in the ways of a true Lanista.

41:52.135 --> 41:54.219
A lesson to be remembered.

41:54.387 --> 41:56.680
It shall be a spectacle

41:56.848 --> 42:00.767
the likes of which the gods themselves
have never witnessed!

42:00.935 --> 42:02.769
Glory to Capua!

42:02.937 --> 42:04.855
Glory to Rome!

42:29.172 --> 42:30.172
Yes!

42:40.683 --> 42:41.934
Nice.

43:27.981 --> 43:29.481
Yes.

44:17.780 --> 44:19.406
Yes!

44:19.574 --> 44:23.327
Once more Gannicus proves himself
a god of the arena!

44:23.494 --> 44:27.289
Ah, were that Tullius here
to witness such a triumph!

44:28.666 --> 44:31.501
Yet I fear the numbers stand
against you in the primus.

44:31.669 --> 44:34.004
Solonius still holds
twice your men.

44:34.172 --> 44:36.381
Eh. Numbers are meaningless.

44:36.549 --> 44:39.301
A lesson good Solonius
is about to discover.

44:39.469 --> 44:40.552
Ha!

44:45.850 --> 44:49.144
We want more, we want more!

44:52.148 --> 44:55.067
Fast we see approaching night.

44:55.234 --> 44:57.694
You shall stand above all others,

44:57.862 --> 45:01.698
eclipsed only
by the gods themselves...

45:01.866 --> 45:04.785
So at last we meet upon the sand.

45:04.952 --> 45:07.245
Two among many.

45:07.413 --> 45:09.331
I give no shit about other men.

45:09.499 --> 45:11.833
I shall prove myself against you
in proper contest.

45:12.001 --> 45:14.503
We face Solonius's men,
not each other.

45:14.670 --> 45:16.713
Only until they have fallen.

45:16.881 --> 45:19.674
Then we shall stand alone,
absent thought of brotherhood.

45:19.842 --> 45:22.427
Attend.

45:22.595 --> 45:24.346
The dominus would have words.

45:29.519 --> 45:31.812
Everything we have dreamed of,

45:31.979 --> 45:34.481
suffered and died for,

45:34.649 --> 45:38.819
the worth of it all turns
upon this single moment.

45:38.986 --> 45:42.531
You face the House of Solonius
and his ill-gotten men.

45:42.698 --> 45:45.367
You stand outnumbered.

45:45.535 --> 45:50.080
But not outmatched.
Only one man will claim victory this day

45:50.248 --> 45:52.874
and earn the title
the Champion of Capua.

45:53.042 --> 45:57.838
And by the gods that man will be
from the fucking House of Batiatus!

46:36.294 --> 46:39.296
Gladiators, form!

47:56.165 --> 47:59.042
Many have fought this day.

47:59.210 --> 48:01.253
Many have died,

48:01.420 --> 48:03.547
their blood staining the sands.

48:03.714 --> 48:08.552
Yet this arena towers
above all others in the Republic.

48:08.719 --> 48:13.974
It is a vast beast,
and it yet hungers!

48:16.018 --> 48:18.520
Two great houses face each other.

48:18.688 --> 48:22.732
Yet every man must ultimately
stand for himself

48:22.900 --> 48:25.443
and himself alone.

48:37.623 --> 48:40.584
- What are they doing?
- It matters not.

48:44.797 --> 48:47.632
Fire burns within their breasts.

48:47.800 --> 48:51.803
And it is fire that shall bind them
in final contest!

49:06.652 --> 49:08.445
Fall to the sands beyond the flames

49:08.613 --> 49:11.448
and find yourself removed
from the primus.

49:11.616 --> 49:13.783
Fall within them

49:13.951 --> 49:16.786
and be removed from this world.

49:16.954 --> 49:19.372
Take position.

49:41.145 --> 49:44.564
Do not die before we meet.

49:47.735 --> 49:51.821
Split heaven
with the sound of your fury!

49:59.121 --> 50:00.288
Begin!

50:38.703 --> 50:40.578
- First blood to Solonius!
- Yes.

50:55.678 --> 50:56.886
Yes.

51:41.891 --> 51:43.975
Yes!

52:02.953 --> 52:04.120
Yes!

52:04.288 --> 52:07.415
It is a pity you did not land
more men in the primus, Solonius.

52:07.583 --> 52:10.126
I fear you may be
eliminated prematurely.

52:21.013 --> 52:23.097
Dagan, you crazy fuck!

52:27.061 --> 52:29.312
Batiatus's men
think so little of his house

52:29.480 --> 52:31.689
they seek to kill each other?

52:59.134 --> 53:01.970
Who stands cunt now?

53:47.641 --> 53:49.893
Capua!

53:51.353 --> 53:53.187
Fuck!

54:20.007 --> 54:21.883
Let us press advantage, brother!

54:22.051 --> 54:24.260
Kill Gannicus,

54:24.428 --> 54:27.221
and decide who is
champion between us, huh?

54:35.356 --> 54:38.441
Your men again set upon each other
before common foe is defeated.

54:38.609 --> 54:41.319
To be expected when animals
are not properly trained.

54:43.530 --> 54:45.740
Gannicus is mine.

55:19.858 --> 55:21.609
It appears odds have shifted.

55:44.091 --> 55:45.800
The odds return to balance.

56:48.489 --> 56:49.864
Yes yes.

57:55.514 --> 57:58.141
Yes!

58:17.369 --> 58:22.123
Yes! The House of Batiatus
stands fucking triumphant!

58:23.208 --> 58:25.168
Whoa! Apologies.

58:25.335 --> 58:28.546
None required.
A most impressive showing.

58:28.714 --> 58:30.423
I do but honor this city

58:30.591 --> 58:32.925
and my champion
continues to do the same.

58:33.093 --> 58:36.095
I have mind towards your man
for my own games.

58:36.263 --> 58:39.640
As do l. Listen to how
he ignites the crowd.

58:43.061 --> 58:46.022
Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!

58:49.985 --> 58:52.028
Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!

58:52.196 --> 58:56.157
Would they not forever remember
this day and the men responsible for it

58:56.325 --> 58:58.451
if Gannicus were granted freedom?

58:59.661 --> 59:01.412
Freedom?

59:01.580 --> 59:03.998
I would have granted the same
in deference to the crowd

59:04.166 --> 59:06.751
- had my man survived.
- An excellent suggestion.

59:06.919 --> 59:09.629
You can always train another gladiator.

59:09.796 --> 59:14.091
Yet to conclude the opening
ceremonies with such a blessing...

59:14.259 --> 59:17.470
As I said, I but honor this city.

59:30.984 --> 59:34.237
Gannicus has proven himself
to the city of Capua.

59:35.489 --> 59:39.784
Let him be rewarded...
with freedom.

59:47.125 --> 59:50.503
Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!

59:50.671 --> 59:53.631
Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!

59:53.799 --> 59:56.884
Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!

59:57.052 --> 01:00:00.304
Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!

01:00:00.472 --> 01:00:02.848
Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!

01:00:03.016 --> 01:00:06.185
Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!

01:00:06.353 --> 01:00:09.397
Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!

01:00:09.564 --> 01:00:12.400
Gannicus! Gannicus! Gannicus!

01:00:12.567 --> 01:00:15.861
Gannicus! Gannicus!

01:00:18.156 --> 01:00:21.158
After all we have suffered,
Gannicus is still lost to us.

01:00:21.326 --> 01:00:23.411
I offered the man coin,

01:00:23.578 --> 01:00:26.956
freedom to come and go as he pleases,
if he would yet fight for our house.

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:31.669
Memories haunt the man

01:00:31.837 --> 01:00:33.921
and drive him from our walls.

01:00:35.757 --> 01:00:38.676
Crixus afforded himself
well in the games.

01:00:38.844 --> 01:00:41.721
Let us turn our hope towards him,

01:00:41.888 --> 01:00:44.974
that he may bring us honor

01:00:45.142 --> 01:00:47.393
and good fortune.

01:00:51.273 --> 01:00:52.815
Yes.

01:00:52.983 --> 01:00:55.526
Let us place our stock in the Gaul

01:00:55.694 --> 01:00:58.362
and see what ends he may service.

01:00:58.530 --> 01:01:00.614
I'm real proud of you, brother.

01:01:03.493 --> 01:01:08.581
I shall join you one
day, you mad fuck.

01:01:08.749 --> 01:01:10.291
Of that there is no doubt.

01:01:24.014 --> 01:01:26.432
We have not yet had proper contest.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.144
Win your own freedom
and seek me out.

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:38.986
Crixus.

01:01:40.655 --> 01:01:43.741
I was given this when I became
champion of this house.

01:01:51.166 --> 01:01:53.542
Wear it with more honor than I have.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:26.742
You have earned the rudis...

01:02:26.910 --> 01:02:30.121
proof you no longer stand a slave.

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:41.382
A lifetime of blood.

01:02:41.550 --> 01:02:43.217
And victory.

01:02:43.385 --> 01:02:46.804
It lifts troubled heart to see
my brother gain his freedom.

01:02:46.972 --> 01:02:49.432
Melitta would have been proud.

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.689
Oenomaus...

01:03:04.281 --> 01:03:08.868
she loved you above all others.

01:03:12.581 --> 01:03:14.457
The thought shall keep me warm

01:03:14.624 --> 01:03:16.625
till I join her in the afterlife.

01:03:16.793 --> 01:03:19.503
And I shall meet you both there.

01:04:27.239 --> 01:04:29.406
Doctore.

01:04:30.575 --> 01:04:32.159
Begin the day's training.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.755
First position!

01:04:53.348 --> 01:04:56.183
I would not hear the name Gannicus
spoken within these walls.

01:04:56.351 --> 01:04:59.228
Or that of Tullius
or his cock-eating apprentice.

01:04:59.396 --> 01:05:02.648
Such things are of the past.

01:05:04.776 --> 01:05:07.736
Let us look towards a brighter future.

01:05:07.904 --> 01:05:11.031
My eyes are firmly fixed.

01:05:16.746 --> 01:05:19.873
We will see this house elevated...

01:05:20.041 --> 01:05:25.170
beyond my father, beyond Solonius,
beyond the fucking gods themselves.

01:05:25.338 --> 01:05:28.716
We will leave our mark
upon this city.

01:05:28.883 --> 01:05:31.302
And one day

01:05:31.469 --> 01:05:34.930
we will see proper reward
for all we have done.

01:05:38.226 --> 01:05:41.061
I have done this thing
because it is just.

01:05:42.272 --> 01:05:44.857
Blood demands blood.

01:05:45.025 --> 01:05:47.818
We have lived and lost

01:05:47.986 --> 01:05:51.322
at the whims of our masters
for too long.

01:05:51.489 --> 01:05:54.408
I would not have it so.

01:05:56.494 --> 01:06:00.205
Your lives are your own.
Forge your own path...

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:02.791
or join with us

01:06:02.959 --> 01:06:06.712
and together we shall see
Rome tremble!
