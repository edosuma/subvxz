WEBVTT

00:01.566 --> 00:03.046
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...
<i>Want to get</i>

00:03.090 --> 00:04.526
<i>into her good graces?</i> <i>
Call her Mama Pina.</i>

00:04.569 --> 00:06.180
I open my home

00:06.223 --> 00:09.444
<i>to undocumented women</i> <i>
escaping bad situations.</i>

00:09.487 --> 00:11.185
My, uh, cell phone
number's on the back.

00:11.228 --> 00:12.925
If you need any help
in the future,

00:12.969 --> 00:14.492
- I'm your first call.
- Okay.

00:14.536 --> 00:17.539
Three years ago, I started
thinking about adoption.

00:17.582 --> 00:19.628
I told the agency yes.

00:19.671 --> 00:22.065
I need to know
where we stand.

00:22.109 --> 00:23.719
We'll figure it out
together then.

00:30.943 --> 00:32.206
Got an inmate here
who needs help.

00:32.249 --> 00:33.381
- What happened to him?
- Seizures started

00:33.424 --> 00:35.122
a half hour ago.
We were taking him

00:35.165 --> 00:36.732
to University Hospital,
but didn't think he'd make it.

00:36.775 --> 00:38.081
You guys were
the nearest ER.

00:38.125 --> 00:39.343
Dipping in and out
of consciousness?

00:39.387 --> 00:40.910
Mostly out.

00:40.953 --> 00:42.216
Facial drooping.

00:43.739 --> 00:45.088
Dilated pupils.

00:45.132 --> 00:46.655
Can we lose his restraints?

00:46.698 --> 00:48.526
Uh, not a chance. No.

00:48.570 --> 00:49.875
Code Blue.

00:49.919 --> 00:51.399
Page Dr. Gregory.
Escalating seizures,

00:51.442 --> 00:53.444
possible intracerebral
hemorrhage. Let's get him

00:53.488 --> 00:55.838
prepped for imaging.
Neurosurgeon's on his way.

01:01.365 --> 01:03.280
And before you hang up,

01:03.324 --> 01:05.152
remind the caller
we'll be sending

01:05.195 --> 01:06.892
a two-person team
to help de-escalate.

01:06.936 --> 01:09.112
911 dispatch will only forward

01:09.156 --> 01:10.896
non-violent calls
to the hotline,

01:10.940 --> 01:12.115
but police
and paramedics

01:12.159 --> 01:14.335
are standing by
if it goes sideways.

01:14.378 --> 01:15.684
You have a question, Debra?

01:15.727 --> 01:17.120
Yeah, I thought the whole point

01:17.164 --> 01:19.253
was to stop the LAPD
from aggravating people.

01:19.296 --> 01:21.559
Why involve
cops at all?

01:21.603 --> 01:23.431
Our program,
which we're calling "C.O.P.E.,"

01:23.474 --> 01:26.303
works in tandem with the police,
not in opposition to them.

01:26.347 --> 01:28.610
This pilot program
was actually founded

01:28.653 --> 01:30.481
by a police officer, who's

01:30.525 --> 01:33.005
- right over there.
- How y'all doing?

01:33.049 --> 01:34.181
My name's Hondo.

01:34.224 --> 01:35.704
I'm a SWAT officer,

01:35.747 --> 01:37.445
just like my friend
Dominique Luca over here.

01:37.488 --> 01:39.490
Hey. Hey, everyone.
- Nice to meet you.
- Listen.

01:39.534 --> 01:41.057
It's really important

01:41.101 --> 01:42.537
that civilians like
yourselves and Nichelle

01:42.580 --> 01:44.321
are at the forefront
of this program.

01:44.365 --> 01:46.541
When someone has a mental health
episode, sometimes the last

01:46.584 --> 01:48.717
person they want to talk to
is a uniformed officer.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.414
Got anything to add, Luca?

01:50.458 --> 01:53.591
Yeah, piece of advice. When you
first respond to a call,

01:53.635 --> 01:55.158
just take a step back
and listen

01:55.202 --> 01:57.160
to what the person has to say.
I mean, maybe

01:57.204 --> 01:59.510
she was fired, maybe
his wife walked out on him.

01:59.554 --> 02:02.165
You're gonna meet people
on the worst day of their lives,

02:02.209 --> 02:03.688
so try to imagine
that you're talking

02:03.732 --> 02:05.821
to someone like your own mother,
your own sibling.

02:05.864 --> 02:07.475
Me and my sister
don't get along.

02:07.518 --> 02:09.564
Well, then maybe you
should stick to the mama plan.

02:11.087 --> 02:12.480
We just want
to say thank you

02:12.523 --> 02:13.785
for giving up your time
to help people.

02:13.829 --> 02:15.135
It really can
make a difference.

02:15.178 --> 02:16.658
I know it did for me.

02:18.268 --> 02:20.183
Okay, well, that about
covers it, everyone.

02:20.227 --> 02:22.054
Stay around to chat,
just be sure

02:22.098 --> 02:23.708
to get your credentials
before you leave.

02:23.752 --> 02:25.797
Thank you.

02:25.841 --> 02:29.366
Nichelle might be a legit saint,
man, spearheading this project,

02:29.410 --> 02:30.802
adopting a baby, putting up

02:30.846 --> 02:32.761
with your ass.
It's hard to believe

02:32.804 --> 02:34.980
she'll be a mom
three weeks from now.

02:35.024 --> 02:37.679
You know, it's actually
two weeks and two days, Luca.

02:37.722 --> 02:40.421
Or at least that's
the birth mother's due date.

02:40.464 --> 02:41.944
I just spent the weekend

02:41.987 --> 02:43.772
at Nichelle's place
painting the nursery,

02:43.815 --> 02:45.730
and if you think for a second
there's only one shade of lilac,

02:45.774 --> 02:47.384
let me tell you,
you're wrong.

02:47.428 --> 02:48.951
You feel ready?

02:48.994 --> 02:51.214
I mean, seems like
this all happened so fast.

02:51.258 --> 02:52.955
Am I ready to date
a woman with a baby?

02:52.998 --> 02:56.176
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Of course.

02:56.219 --> 02:57.829
As ready as I can be.

02:57.873 --> 02:59.440
Hey, I think something's
going on with Nichelle.

03:04.967 --> 03:08.144
Okay. Thank you.
I'm on my way.

03:08.188 --> 03:09.624
What's going on?

03:09.667 --> 03:11.582
Crystal's in labor.

03:11.626 --> 03:13.932
Is everything okay?
Is this too early?
No.

03:13.976 --> 03:15.543
Everything is fine.
It's not too early.

03:15.586 --> 03:17.849
She's 37 weeks.

03:17.893 --> 03:19.721
Um, I have to get
to Riverside.

03:19.764 --> 03:21.853
My rep is meeting me
- at the adoption agency.
- Okay, baby, go.

03:21.897 --> 03:23.899
We'll wrap things up here.
Call as soon

03:23.942 --> 03:25.814
- as you know anything.
- Okay.

03:30.558 --> 03:31.950
Mmm.

03:31.994 --> 03:33.561
- It's really happening.
- Not if you don't get

03:33.604 --> 03:36.216
your cute butt over there.
Now go. Go.

03:40.959 --> 03:42.570
Dr. Miller to surgical con B.

03:42.613 --> 03:45.921
We need this patient prepped
and ready for surgery.

03:45.964 --> 03:47.662
Let's get him sedated.

03:47.705 --> 03:50.491
I don't want a hematoma leaving
us with a hemorrhagic stroke.

03:50.534 --> 03:53.581
Yes, sir.

03:54.930 --> 03:56.453
How are his vitals?

03:56.497 --> 03:57.933
Vitals are stable.

04:07.116 --> 04:08.465
Don't say a word.

04:08.509 --> 04:10.380
There are officers
right outside.

04:10.424 --> 04:13.296
You walk out, they'll shoot... Shut the hell up!

04:13.340 --> 04:15.559
I kill the next person
that speaks.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.345
All of you,
get in there.

04:22.479 --> 04:24.612
Get in there.

04:30.139 --> 04:31.445
Put this on.

04:31.488 --> 04:32.750
Quick.
Where's the rest
of the stuff?

04:32.794 --> 04:35.666
Here. Everything
you asked for.

04:35.710 --> 04:37.277
We got to move.

04:40.976 --> 04:43.892
Hold on a second.
Something I want to do.

04:46.460 --> 04:48.026
- What's that?
- Defibrillator.

04:48.070 --> 04:49.767
360 joules.

04:49.811 --> 04:52.553
We're gonna get out of here,
we're gonna need some cover.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.732
Thanks for helping.

04:57.775 --> 05:00.038
These girls can use
all the security they can get.

05:00.082 --> 05:01.431
Yeah, of course.

05:01.475 --> 05:03.215
It's a nice change of pace.

05:03.259 --> 05:05.305
You know there's
no paycheck, right?

05:05.348 --> 05:07.481
Uh, that's what you think.
Wait till you see the tab

05:07.524 --> 05:09.526
I run up at dinner.
I mean, come on.

05:09.570 --> 05:11.746
You said you'd take me out
for a meal if I helped you out.

05:11.789 --> 05:13.225
B.S. I said
I'd buy you a burger.

05:13.269 --> 05:14.705
Well, I want my burger

05:14.749 --> 05:16.794
at Paul's Chophouse,
and I want it tonight.

05:16.838 --> 05:18.709
A promise
is a promise.

05:24.715 --> 05:26.630
Marta Valdez, the girl
from El Salvador?

05:26.674 --> 05:28.371
Yes.

05:29.981 --> 05:31.635
This is a
notice to appear

05:31.679 --> 05:33.376
at immigration court
this afternoon.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.117
Marta's case
was fast-tracked.

05:35.160 --> 05:38.903
A few months ago, she was
charged with felony possession.

05:38.947 --> 05:41.036
A girl at her restaurant
gave her a ride,

05:41.079 --> 05:43.691
and the cops found pills
in the glove box.

05:43.734 --> 05:45.475
It wasn't her fault.

05:45.519 --> 05:47.564
Doesn't matter. Immigration
court can use the police records

05:47.608 --> 05:49.653
to deport Marta,
no questions asked.

05:49.697 --> 05:51.873
The only way they'll let her
stay is if she's granted asylum.

05:51.916 --> 05:54.310
We told her that,
but she said she won't go.

05:54.354 --> 05:56.399
- Why not?
- The things that happened

05:56.443 --> 05:58.009
to Marta
in El Salvador.

05:58.053 --> 05:59.924
There were men
that, uh,

05:59.968 --> 06:02.536
that did terrible things to her.

06:02.579 --> 06:04.538
It's something Marta
just doesn't talk about.

06:04.581 --> 06:05.756
Well, she has to.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.280
- Where is she now?
- At her job.

06:08.324 --> 06:10.108
- Will you go see her?
- Of course.

06:10.152 --> 06:11.458
Thank you.

06:11.501 --> 06:13.111
I told her that
we could trust you,

06:13.155 --> 06:15.200
that you
would listen.

06:21.337 --> 06:22.904
We're gonna make it.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.427
Not if you
don't ease up.

06:30.302 --> 06:33.654
- She recognized you.
- Keep walking.

06:33.697 --> 06:34.785
It's him! He's getting away!

06:34.829 --> 06:36.352
Stop!
Down on the ground!

06:39.660 --> 06:41.488
Shots fired.
Newburn Memorial Hospital.

06:41.531 --> 06:42.880
Surgical unit.

06:42.924 --> 06:44.621
Two suspects armed,
wearing scrubs.

06:44.665 --> 06:45.927
You won't
make it out!

06:45.970 --> 06:47.407
Put your guns down!

06:48.930 --> 06:50.235
Oh, no.

07:35.542 --> 07:38.153
I heard your girlfriend's
expecting a special delivery.

07:38.196 --> 07:39.981
- When will you know?
- Soon, I hope.

07:40.024 --> 07:42.549
Birth mother's already
been at it for three hours.

07:42.592 --> 07:43.854
Three hours is nothing.

07:43.898 --> 07:47.510
Took Barb 20 with Molly,
16 with JP.

07:47.554 --> 07:49.730
You're bragging like you
actually did something.

07:49.773 --> 07:52.472
I did. I waited.
It was stressful.

07:52.515 --> 07:54.778
Yeah,
that's what I hear.

07:54.822 --> 07:55.997
All right, how does a prisoner

07:56.040 --> 07:58.390
trick deputies
to bring him off-site?

07:58.434 --> 08:00.175
I mean, it can't be their
first fake medical crisis.

08:00.218 --> 08:01.959
Must've been a hell
of a performance.

08:02.003 --> 08:04.135
Deacon's on with the warden now.
Maybe he'll know something.

08:04.179 --> 08:06.573
Joey Baratta.
A decade into

08:06.616 --> 08:08.575
a life sentence.
Nine murders that we know of.

08:08.618 --> 08:11.316
Weapon of choice
is the vehicle-borne IED.

08:11.360 --> 08:14.015
And he was exclusively
a car bomber?

08:14.058 --> 08:16.408
Maximum damage,
minimum risk.

08:16.452 --> 08:18.019
Boston native.

08:18.062 --> 08:20.064
Defended Moreti family's
interests on the East Coast

08:20.108 --> 08:23.894
until blessing L.A. with his
criminal presence in 2005.

08:23.938 --> 08:26.941
ATF tracked him down a few years
later and put him away.

08:26.984 --> 08:28.682
Until today.

08:28.725 --> 08:30.335
You seem to be well-acquainted
with this guy already.

08:30.379 --> 08:33.513
The ATF agent who caught him
used to be a friend of mine.

08:35.079 --> 08:37.517
Guards found a bootleg drink
in Baratta's cell,

08:37.560 --> 08:39.823
triggers an allergic reaction
that mimics a stroke.

08:39.867 --> 08:41.521
Doctors wouldn't have been able
to know that he faked it

08:41.564 --> 08:43.000
until they got him
into surgery.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.524
That's pretty risky.
Guy must be desperate.

08:44.567 --> 08:46.482
Well, desperate doesn't
begin to cover it.

08:46.526 --> 08:47.744
Earlier this year,
he was diagnosed

08:47.788 --> 08:49.267
with grade four brain cancer.

08:49.311 --> 08:50.573
Just last week,
they said he's got

08:50.617 --> 08:52.053
two months to live,
three tops.

08:52.096 --> 08:53.358
Warden got any idea
where he might want

08:53.402 --> 08:55.143
to spend his final days?

08:55.186 --> 08:56.840
From what it sounds like,
he thinks he's gonna lay low.

08:56.884 --> 08:58.842
Said he'd bet the farm
we never hear from him again.

09:02.280 --> 09:03.717
Well, I hope you took
that bet, Deac.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.545
Look at this.

09:07.503 --> 09:08.983
What are the odds
that's not Baratta?

09:09.026 --> 09:10.419
There's no way
that's a coincidence.

09:10.462 --> 09:11.768
Rocker's squad's out that way.

09:11.812 --> 09:13.378
I'll have them
secure the blast site.

09:13.422 --> 09:15.076
I wonder how many people
are out there that Baratta

09:15.119 --> 09:16.381
would like to get even with.

09:16.425 --> 09:17.731
We better figure out
who those people are

09:17.774 --> 09:19.210
and get them under
protective custody.

09:19.254 --> 09:20.995
Maybe I'll swing by
the blast site.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.431
See if there's
- anything there.
- All right. Bring Luca.

09:22.474 --> 09:24.389
I got a hunch this guy's
just getting started.

09:26.870 --> 09:28.785
Eyewitness saw the victim

09:28.829 --> 09:30.744
turn the ignition, then his van
went up in a fireball.

09:30.787 --> 09:32.136
One dead,
six wounded.

09:32.180 --> 09:33.529
We have no clue
why he was targeted?

09:33.573 --> 09:34.835
No clear-cut link to Baratta?

09:34.878 --> 09:36.358
No. From what
I could find,

09:36.401 --> 09:38.795
he was a normal guy.
Works as a forest ranger,

09:38.839 --> 09:40.101
volunteered
at his church.

09:40.144 --> 09:41.972
What if Baratta picked
his van at random?

09:42.016 --> 09:43.365
He might be going
scorched earth.

09:43.408 --> 09:44.671
One last rampage
to remember him by.

09:46.411 --> 09:48.283
Been a long time, Bob.

09:48.326 --> 09:50.720
Maybe not
long enough, huh?

09:50.764 --> 09:52.156
How you doing?
Ray Kaminski.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.289
Explosive specialist, ATF.

09:54.332 --> 09:55.420
What's your name, kiddo?

09:55.464 --> 09:56.726
Victor Tan. Good to meet you.

09:56.770 --> 09:57.858
Likewise.

09:57.901 --> 09:59.294
The hell are you
doing here, Ray?

09:59.337 --> 10:01.122
LAPD has formed an emergency

10:01.165 --> 10:03.559
joint task force.
ATF sent me as point.

10:03.603 --> 10:06.083
Higher-ups know I have
a history with Baratta.

10:06.127 --> 10:07.476
Figured, you know, since
I helped catch him before,

10:07.519 --> 10:08.477
I can do it again.

10:08.520 --> 10:10.479
Tell them the truth.

10:10.522 --> 10:12.742
You're just a munitions grunt
who got lucky.

10:12.786 --> 10:16.006
I'd ask you if he's always
this ornery, but...

10:16.050 --> 10:18.008
we were roomies
back at the Academy,

10:18.052 --> 10:19.793
think I know
the answer.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.708
- You expected me to change?
- Well...

10:21.751 --> 10:23.884
it's been a while
since you lost Barb.

10:23.927 --> 10:26.147
Thought maybe by now
you'd thawed out.

10:27.409 --> 10:28.932
Deac sent crime scene photos.

10:32.588 --> 10:34.155
Magnets.

10:34.198 --> 10:36.244
That's Baratta's
signature.

10:36.287 --> 10:38.768
He gets a block of C-4,
secures it to the undercarriage

10:38.812 --> 10:41.553
with these magnetic disks,
ties it into

10:41.597 --> 10:43.599
the fuel line, turns the car
itself into a bomb,

10:43.643 --> 10:44.948
like a mechanic from hell.

10:44.992 --> 10:47.124
In order to get that
under the van in public,

10:47.168 --> 10:49.736
he had to have had a lookout.
He's got outside help.

10:49.779 --> 10:51.476
We know he has
an accomplice.

10:51.520 --> 10:53.130
It's how he escaped
in the first place.

10:53.174 --> 10:54.654
You got a lead
on the guy's I.D.?

10:56.046 --> 10:57.395
Yeah, I didn't
think so.

10:57.439 --> 10:59.093
Lucky for you...

11:00.529 --> 11:02.444
Guy from the hospital.

11:02.487 --> 11:04.098
- How'd you get this?
- Got a contact,

11:04.141 --> 11:05.577
works for a
demolition company,

11:05.621 --> 11:07.754
recognized him from the news.
Said he came in

11:07.797 --> 11:10.670
nosing around looking to buy
plastic explosives last week.

11:10.713 --> 11:12.019
Thought it was suspicious, so...

11:12.062 --> 11:14.021
- he pulled an image.
- Tattoo on his arm,

11:14.064 --> 11:16.632
barbed wire making an "S."
That's a prison tat.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.895
Run it through the Department
of Corrections archive,

11:18.939 --> 11:20.244
see if it hits.

11:20.288 --> 11:22.943
I'll have Kaminski
text it to you.

11:22.986 --> 11:26.076
Kind of a funny way
to have a reunion, huh?

11:26.120 --> 11:28.339
A Scout leader blew up
in his church van.

11:28.383 --> 11:30.646
Nothing about today's funny.

11:30.690 --> 11:32.343
Haven't spoken in years,
two minutes in,

11:32.387 --> 11:34.432
you're already correcting me.

11:34.476 --> 11:35.825
Where's your armory?
I'll set up shop there.

11:35.869 --> 11:37.261
You'll find it.

11:45.356 --> 11:46.314
Hey.

11:46.357 --> 11:47.881
How'd it go
with Marta?

11:47.924 --> 11:49.709
You think she'll make it
to immigration court?

11:49.752 --> 11:51.145
She ghosted me.
I went to her restaurant,

11:51.188 --> 11:52.581
but she ducked out
the back.

11:52.624 --> 11:53.843
Man, she must really be scared

11:53.887 --> 11:55.497
of whatever she thinks
is coming.

11:55.540 --> 11:57.064
I told Mama Pina I'd give
Marta another chance,

11:57.107 --> 11:58.369
but she has to
come to me.

11:58.413 --> 11:59.936
You can't want something
for someone

11:59.980 --> 12:02.069
more than she
- wants it for herself.
- Yeah.

12:02.112 --> 12:05.637
So... we on for dinner
after work?

12:05.681 --> 12:06.856
Come on. You've
been wanting to try

12:06.900 --> 12:08.205
Paul's Chophouse
since it opened.

12:09.380 --> 12:11.513
Medium rare.

12:11.556 --> 12:13.210
Side of broccolini.

12:13.254 --> 12:15.735
What the hell, a girl's
- got to eat.
- Great,

12:15.778 --> 12:18.563
'cause I already made
reservations. After work, 8:00.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.569
Say hi to Grandma.

12:24.613 --> 12:25.832
Bye.

12:25.875 --> 12:28.008
Love you.

12:28.051 --> 12:31.098
Twins are safe
at my mom's.

12:31.141 --> 12:33.491
- Said the cops are outside now.
- Do the boys know

12:33.535 --> 12:35.537
that their dad
just blew up someone's vehicle?

12:36.799 --> 12:38.018
Do they even know
he escaped?

12:38.061 --> 12:40.803
Not sure they'd care
if they did.

12:40.847 --> 12:43.197
Joey hasn't seen them
since they were in diapers.

12:43.240 --> 12:45.329
They're 11.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.810
Can you confirm that you see
your ex in this video?

12:50.857 --> 12:52.206
Yeah. That's him.

12:52.249 --> 12:53.773
Joey Baratta.

12:53.816 --> 12:55.339
You recognize the man he's with?

12:55.383 --> 12:57.646
No. Joey always had

12:57.689 --> 13:01.041
some sidekick around,
doing whatever he said.

13:01.084 --> 13:03.739
He's a manipulative man.

13:03.783 --> 13:05.741
It's why I stayed with him
for so long.

13:05.785 --> 13:07.221
That and the boys.

13:07.264 --> 13:09.571
Plus, Joey was paying
the bills, so...

13:09.614 --> 13:11.094
I thought I was done
with this crap.

13:11.138 --> 13:13.140
Now, I need you
to tell me the truth.

13:13.183 --> 13:15.055
Do you have any idea
- where he's hiding out?
- What?

13:15.098 --> 13:17.361
- Hell no.
- You sure about that?

13:17.405 --> 13:19.581
'Cause I think he gave you a
heads-up about his escape plans.

13:19.624 --> 13:21.322
- What are you talking about?
- Guards found a burner phone

13:21.365 --> 13:23.933
in his cell. Looks like
he placed a ten-minute call

13:23.977 --> 13:25.587
to your office line last week.
Do you remember that?

13:25.630 --> 13:27.458
You got to be
kidding me.

13:27.502 --> 13:29.330
He called to tell me his cancer
spread, and he didn't have long.

13:29.373 --> 13:30.984
He wanted to talk to our boys.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.029
I said no.
Is that a crime?

13:33.073 --> 13:34.814
Depends on what else
you discussed.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.033
You have kids, Sergeant?

13:37.077 --> 13:38.992
Well...

13:39.035 --> 13:41.081
I'll take that as a no.

13:42.952 --> 13:46.477
Maybe one day,
you'll know what it feels like.

13:46.521 --> 13:48.566
Being a single parent.

13:48.610 --> 13:51.352
There's not many
things harder.

13:55.443 --> 13:56.836
Excuse me.

14:01.449 --> 14:04.365
Baratta's accomplice is
an ex-con named Nick Russo.

14:04.408 --> 14:06.106
Two of them met in prison
a few years ago.

14:06.149 --> 14:08.021
Only address we found for Russo
is out in Barstow.

14:08.064 --> 14:09.631
Cops are
hitting it now.

14:09.674 --> 14:11.459
Russo got any ties to L.A.?Just an ex-girlfriend

14:11.502 --> 14:13.548
who moved here last year after
filing a restraining order.

14:13.591 --> 14:15.898
- Think she's in danger?
- Have Deacon and Luca stop by her place.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.030
See if she's willing to come in.

14:21.164 --> 14:22.949
Katie Erdman.

14:22.992 --> 14:24.689
14B.

14:24.733 --> 14:26.822
Tan say why she ordered the
restraining order against Russo?

14:26.866 --> 14:29.042
No, but given
his choice of friends,

14:29.085 --> 14:31.479
I can only imagine.

14:34.134 --> 14:35.875
Katie Erdman?

14:35.918 --> 14:38.355
LAPD. It's a welfare check.

14:46.015 --> 14:47.495
LAPD.

14:49.018 --> 14:51.064
Katie?

14:51.107 --> 14:52.848
This is LAPD. Anyone home?

14:52.892 --> 14:54.241
Katie?

14:56.373 --> 14:58.245
Hey.

14:58.288 --> 15:00.029
Bedroom's clear.
Taped to her mirror.

15:00.073 --> 15:01.378
Russo.

15:01.422 --> 15:03.076
Boyfriend of the year.

15:03.119 --> 15:04.512
Yeah, check out the date on
the bottom. Taken ten days ago.

15:04.555 --> 15:06.731
Katie's not much
of an ex.

15:06.775 --> 15:08.037
She's not much
of a cook either.

15:08.081 --> 15:10.997
Look at that.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.782
Obviously trying
to destroy evidence.

15:13.825 --> 15:16.741
Ah, man, long-lens surveillance.

15:16.785 --> 15:19.048
Photos of license plates,

15:19.092 --> 15:22.399
- shots of parking lots.
- Speeding ticket.

15:22.443 --> 15:24.184
Russo was clocked doing 110

15:24.227 --> 15:27.839
on his red Ducati 1098
couple weeks back.

15:27.883 --> 15:30.320
Talk to me, Tan.

15:30.364 --> 15:32.018
Russo used the apartment
as a war room

15:32.061 --> 15:34.107
to plan Baratta's escape,
the bombing,

15:34.150 --> 15:35.630
maybe a whole lot more.

15:35.673 --> 15:37.806
We put a BOLO out
- on the Ducati?
- Yeah.

15:39.416 --> 15:42.680
This is what we salvaged
from all the burnt evidence.

15:42.724 --> 15:45.205
He surveilled dozens of targets,
but destroyed his notes.

15:45.248 --> 15:47.555
Still, we matched a few photos
to the locations

15:47.598 --> 15:49.992
they were taken.
Any of these cars owned by people linked to Baratta?

15:50.036 --> 15:51.994
Someone he'd want
to kill? Bookies,

15:52.038 --> 15:53.387
loan sharks,
informants?

15:53.430 --> 15:55.041
No. No one in Baratta's orbit.

15:55.084 --> 15:57.086
A red Ducati was just seen
speeding in the Valley.

15:57.130 --> 15:58.479
Raced out of the
Phelps Law Firm's parking lot.

15:58.522 --> 15:59.741
Defense attorneys.

15:59.784 --> 16:01.525
Maybe one of them
represented Baratta.

16:01.569 --> 16:03.484
You think he's after
his old lawyer?

16:03.527 --> 16:06.313
Any of Russo's surveillance take
place anywhere near that firm?

16:11.100 --> 16:12.362
This photo looks like
it was taken

16:12.406 --> 16:13.581
right in their
parking lot.

16:13.624 --> 16:15.365
1200 block of East Mason.

16:15.409 --> 16:17.715
Well, they just planted
an IED in this guy's car.

16:17.759 --> 16:20.718
I'll call the firm to start
evacuating. Roll out!

16:32.861 --> 16:34.080
All right,
Deac and Luca,

16:34.123 --> 16:36.038
cover the one side.
Keep people moving.

16:36.082 --> 16:38.040
Be firm, but calm.
We don't want panic.

16:38.084 --> 16:39.999
We're looking for a silver car,
plate starts with "4."

16:40.042 --> 16:41.304
Go.

16:44.568 --> 16:45.917
I need you to walk this way.

16:45.961 --> 16:47.049
Head to that
sidewalk, please.

16:47.093 --> 16:48.485
Stay away from
the cars, everyone.

16:48.529 --> 16:49.704
- Away from the cars.
- Over here, over here.

16:49.747 --> 16:51.314
This side of me.
Folks, keep moving.

16:51.358 --> 16:54.013
20-David. Row two is clear.
Moving to row three.

16:54.056 --> 16:55.710
Hold on. Tan.

16:55.753 --> 16:58.191
- Think I found the car.
- Hey. Step away

16:58.234 --> 16:59.583
from the vehicle.
Sir, we need you

16:59.627 --> 17:00.932
to get out on the street
for your own safety.

17:00.976 --> 17:02.064
Move.
Dealer plates.

17:02.108 --> 17:03.979
Wrong car.
Repeat, wrong car.

17:04.023 --> 17:05.067
Go out that way.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.112
Head out towards
the street.

17:07.852 --> 17:10.768
Bomb! There's a bomb
inside the building!

17:10.812 --> 17:12.596
- Come on.
- Go, go, go, go.

17:12.640 --> 17:13.771
I found the target!

17:13.815 --> 17:15.034
Silver sedan.

17:15.077 --> 17:17.210
It's the right plate.
Sir! Stop! Wait!

17:17.253 --> 17:19.168
Do not start that car!

17:26.088 --> 17:27.872
Sir, sir.

17:27.916 --> 17:30.092
- Open your eyes. Look at me.
- What?

17:30.136 --> 17:31.963
I... I can't hear you.

17:32.007 --> 17:33.835
There was an explosion.

17:33.878 --> 17:36.055
One of your former clients
escaped from prison.

17:36.098 --> 17:37.621
Joey Baratta.

17:37.665 --> 17:39.797
- We think he's out for revenge.
- Who?

17:39.841 --> 17:42.104
I never had
a client named Baratta.

17:42.148 --> 17:43.932
Why would he
do this to me?

17:50.895 --> 17:52.636
The victim finish giving <i>
his statement?</i>

17:52.680 --> 17:54.551
He's represented
some hardcore criminals,

17:54.595 --> 17:55.770
just not Baratta.

17:55.813 --> 17:57.467
So why'd Baratta
blow up his car?

17:57.511 --> 17:59.121
- It doesn't make sense.
- It will.

17:59.165 --> 18:00.992
Just keep digging.

18:01.036 --> 18:02.603
Kaminski still chatting it up
out there with the bomb techs?

18:02.646 --> 18:04.648
Of course he is.

18:04.692 --> 18:06.650
Just thrilled
to have a day off

18:06.694 --> 18:08.783
from writing
fireworks citations.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.658
What's his issue with Kaminski?

18:14.702 --> 18:16.573
Just between you and me?

18:16.617 --> 18:19.533
Kaminski dated Hicks's wife
Barb during the Academy days.

18:19.576 --> 18:21.622
It's actually
how Hicks met Barb.

18:21.665 --> 18:25.191
So, Hicks was the O.G.
Mr. "Steal Your Girl"?

18:25.234 --> 18:26.931
Never would'vethought.

18:26.975 --> 18:28.890
How'd it become
lifelong beef?

18:28.933 --> 18:30.935
A few years
before Barb got sick,

18:30.979 --> 18:32.937
she and Hicks went through
a rough patch.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.809
I'd guess Kaminski
cozied back up to her,

18:34.852 --> 18:36.419
nearly wrecked Hicks's marriage,

18:36.463 --> 18:38.856
and it all blew up the night
before Barb's funeral.

18:38.900 --> 18:40.815
- What happened?
- Kaminski showed up

18:40.858 --> 18:44.471
to her wake,
and Hicks just went off.

18:44.514 --> 18:46.777
The way I remember it,
it almost ended in blows.

18:50.520 --> 18:53.784
Hey. Gonna hitch
a ride back to HQ.

18:53.828 --> 18:56.178
Chris took the SUV.

18:56.222 --> 18:58.049
Deacon,
how's she doing?

18:58.093 --> 19:01.009
Uh, good, I think.
You know, she's... she's Chris.

19:01.052 --> 19:03.142
- Hmm.
- I know she's been spending a lot of time

19:03.185 --> 19:05.318
at that safe house
helping out the girls there.

19:05.361 --> 19:07.885
She might be juggling
one ball too many.

19:07.929 --> 19:09.365
Help me keep an eye
on her, all right??

19:09.409 --> 19:12.890
Yeah. Course.
Any word from Nichelle yet?

19:12.934 --> 19:14.979
I'm sorry. I don't know why
I asked that.

19:15.023 --> 19:16.981
You would've
said something.

19:17.025 --> 19:18.157
You'd think
I'd know that,

19:18.200 --> 19:19.201
having been through it
four times.

19:19.245 --> 19:20.637
- Don't even sweat it,
- Deac.

19:20.681 --> 19:22.378
Adoption reps are probably
walking Nichelle

19:22.422 --> 19:24.467
through 100 things right now.
She'll call me when she can.

19:24.511 --> 19:27.078
You feeling a little left out
of the process, huh?

19:27.122 --> 19:30.386
You know, I didn't think
I would, but yeah.

19:30.430 --> 19:33.868
I know it won't be my signature
on the adoption papers, but...

19:33.911 --> 19:36.218
Nichelle's important to me,
which means

19:36.262 --> 19:38.307
this kid will be, too.

19:40.309 --> 19:42.703
What if Baratta's
not out for revenge?

19:42.746 --> 19:44.313
Why else do you think
he'd do this?

19:44.357 --> 19:47.055
I'm not sure yet.

19:47.098 --> 19:49.275
Maybe the answer's
back in that prison.

19:54.845 --> 19:57.283
Marta, I'm glad you came.

19:57.326 --> 20:00.242
I only have a minute,
so please listen to me.

20:00.286 --> 20:01.896
You have to show up
to your asylum hearing today.

20:01.939 --> 20:03.680
You got to tell them
the truth about

20:03.724 --> 20:06.074
what you suffered in El Salvador
and why you fear going back.

20:06.117 --> 20:07.510
It's the only way
they're gonna let you

20:07.554 --> 20:08.816
stay in this country.
Do you understand?

20:08.859 --> 20:11.340
Mama Pina said
to give you this.

20:13.255 --> 20:14.648
I, uh...

20:14.691 --> 20:16.998
I wrote what happened
to me in the city,

20:17.041 --> 20:19.348
with the men.

20:19.392 --> 20:21.481
How they used me, how...

20:21.524 --> 20:23.874
they said they
will find me

20:23.918 --> 20:25.833
and cut me to pieces
and feed me to the dogs.

20:25.876 --> 20:28.792
I-I wrote it allin here.

20:28.836 --> 20:31.665
I'm so sorry, Marta. It's awful.

20:33.362 --> 20:35.146
I'm glad you're
writing in a journal.

20:35.190 --> 20:37.627
Sometimes it's part
of healing.

20:37.671 --> 20:39.150
I know it was for me, too.

20:41.022 --> 20:43.198
Is it okay I wrote it
in Spanish?

20:43.242 --> 20:46.332
The journal?
What do you mean?

20:46.375 --> 20:48.508
You can give the court my story.

20:48.551 --> 20:50.423
It can't be a written statement.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.860
You have to talk
about what happened... No! I won't. It-it-it...

20:52.903 --> 20:55.515
It makes me too...

20:55.558 --> 20:56.646
It's the only way
they're gonna give you

20:56.690 --> 20:57.995
a shot at being granted asylum.

20:58.039 --> 21:00.694
I do not think
I can do it, Chris.

21:00.737 --> 21:03.131
What if I go with you later?

21:03.174 --> 21:05.176
When you're
in front of them,

21:05.220 --> 21:06.656
and you feel like
you can't speak,

21:06.700 --> 21:10.225
you can just look at me,
and we'll get through it.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.708
Deac, look what was scraped off
the bottom of that oven.

21:14.751 --> 21:16.623
It's the last six digits
of a bank account.

21:16.666 --> 21:19.321
Russo must've opened it
for Baratta with a stolen I.D.

21:19.365 --> 21:20.714
And check it out.
A $50,000 deposit

21:20.757 --> 21:22.324
hit the account
earlier today.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.370
It was wired from someone
in the Caymans.

21:25.719 --> 21:26.937
Oh, look at that.

21:26.981 --> 21:29.113
Somebody just deposited
another 50 Gs.

21:29.157 --> 21:30.854
These car bombs...

21:30.898 --> 21:32.813
Baratta's getting paid
to execute people.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.336
Yeah, but who's paying him?

21:34.380 --> 21:35.990
And what's a dying man
need all this money for?

21:36.033 --> 21:39.036
This is Sergeant David Kay
calling for the warden.

21:46.435 --> 21:48.655
Bob.

21:48.698 --> 21:51.048
Got a questionfor you.

21:51.092 --> 21:52.702
On both explosivesso far,

21:52.746 --> 21:54.748
Baratta used a modified
adapter hose

21:54.791 --> 21:57.664
to connect the device
to the fuel line,

21:57.707 --> 22:00.144
so what I need to know is... Be honest with me.

22:02.190 --> 22:04.061
What was your endgame
all those years ago?

22:04.105 --> 22:06.760
Did you really think Barb
was gonna run off with you?

22:15.986 --> 22:18.249
Be honest?

22:18.293 --> 22:19.990
Crossed my mind, yes.

22:20.034 --> 22:22.906
I've burned a few bridges
in my lifetime, Bob,

22:22.950 --> 22:24.691
but Barb and I,
we just...

22:24.734 --> 22:26.170
knew how to listen
to one another.

22:27.824 --> 22:30.087
What a crock.

22:30.131 --> 22:32.438
I remember you two
as a couple way back,

22:32.481 --> 22:33.656
always fighting.

22:33.700 --> 22:36.877
One fight. One.
And you...

22:36.920 --> 22:38.792
- dove in.
- You broke up.

22:38.835 --> 22:40.533
She came to you
as a friend.

22:40.576 --> 22:42.622
Next thing I knew,
I'm third wheel

22:42.665 --> 22:44.754
between my roommate
and my girlfriend.

22:44.798 --> 22:47.844
She was the mother
of my children, Ray,

22:47.888 --> 22:49.542
and you made a move.

22:49.585 --> 22:52.414
I've apologized
100 times over.

22:52.458 --> 22:54.677
We never once
crossed a line.

22:54.721 --> 22:55.983
Never once.

22:56.026 --> 22:57.158
And then you show up
at the wake.

22:57.201 --> 22:58.638
Five years later.

22:58.681 --> 23:00.596
My kids were wrecks.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.990
It was all I could do
to get dressed,

23:03.033 --> 23:05.471
and I get to the funeral home
to see you.

23:05.514 --> 23:06.950
She was my friend.

23:06.994 --> 23:08.474
She was my wife!

23:14.305 --> 23:17.221
She only sought my company
because you were too damn busy.

23:17.265 --> 23:20.224
- Oh, please.
- That-that-that. See? That's it.

23:20.268 --> 23:21.965
She told you that,
but you don't listen.

23:22.009 --> 23:23.619
You don't listen
to anybody, Bob.

23:23.663 --> 23:25.447
Yeah.

23:25.491 --> 23:28.145
You didn't take care of Barb
the way you should have.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.932
You weren't there
when she got sick.

23:31.975 --> 23:34.325
You have no idea
what it was like.

23:34.369 --> 23:37.590
I know she deserved
better than you.

23:37.633 --> 23:39.853
Who, Ray?

23:39.896 --> 23:41.942
A twice-divorced
alcoholic

23:41.985 --> 23:44.553
who hasn't seen their
only kid since the '90s?

23:44.597 --> 23:45.859
Screw you.

23:45.902 --> 23:47.469
You're right,

23:47.513 --> 23:49.166
but screw you.

23:55.390 --> 23:56.826
What is that?

23:58.785 --> 24:00.003
It's a tilt fuse.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.226
You fill it with mercury.

24:07.794 --> 24:11.319
Ignition turns,
gas starts to flow.

24:11.362 --> 24:14.191
It tilts. Boom.

24:14.235 --> 24:16.280
Is that what you wanted
to talk about?

24:17.978 --> 24:20.502
See these two fittings
on the connector pieces?

24:20.546 --> 24:22.678
Well, those have been
machine-crimped.

24:22.722 --> 24:25.507
Back in the day, mechanics used
this huge pneumatic machine

24:25.551 --> 24:27.944
to clamp these
onto the fuel line.

24:27.988 --> 24:30.207
What the hell am I
supposed to know about that?

24:31.731 --> 24:34.255
There's only one garage
in all of L.A. that

24:34.298 --> 24:37.345
has an operational
1949 Press-O-Matic.

24:41.218 --> 24:43.264
Thought you might want
to take a ride.

24:43.307 --> 24:45.135
All right.

24:45.179 --> 24:47.094
I'll go.

24:47.137 --> 24:49.183
But we drive separate.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.536
I just briefed the warden
on our two targets.

24:54.580 --> 24:55.581
The forest ranger
that Baratta killed

24:55.624 --> 24:57.452
in his van
and the attorney

24:57.496 --> 24:59.062
- he tried to kill.
- What'd the warden say?

24:59.106 --> 25:00.455
Either one of these guys
do any time?

25:00.499 --> 25:03.110
No, but they both
know someone who did.

25:03.153 --> 25:05.329
Do you remember
Henry Lee Allen?

25:05.373 --> 25:07.201
Yeah. The multi-millionaire
serial killer.

25:07.244 --> 25:09.551
Do you remember
- how he got caught?
- A witness saw Allen

25:09.595 --> 25:11.814
burying a body in the woods,
and he called it in.

25:11.858 --> 25:13.294
That's right.

25:13.337 --> 25:16.079
The witness--
a forest ranger.

25:16.123 --> 25:17.951
The same man that Baratta
blew up in his van.

25:17.994 --> 25:19.779
Deacon, in the defense
attorney's statement,

25:19.822 --> 25:21.389
he mentioned that
Allen was one of his

25:21.432 --> 25:22.999
- high-profile clients.
- He's two for two.

25:23.043 --> 25:25.001
Baratta's taking out
Allen's enemies one by one.

25:25.045 --> 25:26.568
- For 50
- K a pop.

25:26.612 --> 25:27.917
It's the only security
he can leave his family

25:27.961 --> 25:29.223
with the little time
he's got left.

25:29.266 --> 25:30.964
[phone rings]
All right.

25:31.007 --> 25:32.879
We got to do a deep dive
on Allen,

25:32.922 --> 25:34.750
- create an enemies list.
- Well, Street and Tan

25:34.794 --> 25:36.796
are already working the phones.
We'll keep at it.

25:36.839 --> 25:39.059
All right.

25:39.102 --> 25:40.495
Hey. Tell me you got

25:40.539 --> 25:42.236
some baby news, Nichelle.

25:42.279 --> 25:44.325
The baby was born,

25:44.368 --> 25:48.024
but Crystal changed her mind.

25:48.068 --> 25:49.939
What do you mean?

25:49.983 --> 25:52.376
When they put the baby
in her arms,

25:52.420 --> 25:54.727
- she backed out of the adoption.
- What?

25:54.770 --> 25:56.729
Can she do that?

25:56.772 --> 25:58.252
It's her child.

25:58.295 --> 26:01.037
I don't understand.
She signed the agreement.

26:01.081 --> 26:04.084
There's a ten-day grace period
in case this happens.

26:04.127 --> 26:07.000
I just can't believe
it happened to me.

26:07.043 --> 26:08.392
My place is...

26:08.436 --> 26:11.874
full of baby clothes,

26:11.918 --> 26:15.008
her nursery.

26:15.051 --> 26:17.010
I...

26:17.053 --> 26:18.620
I can't go back there.

26:18.664 --> 26:20.448
Okay, listen to me.

26:20.491 --> 26:22.363
We're gonna figure
this out together.

26:23.712 --> 26:25.453
Why don't you just
go to my house.

26:25.496 --> 26:27.586
I'll come home
right after my shift, okay?

26:34.114 --> 26:36.638
You're not gonna believe this.
Henry Lee Allen is facing

26:36.682 --> 26:38.553
a string of murder charges
in Texas.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.729
There's an extradition
hearing tomorrow.

26:40.773 --> 26:41.904
So, if California's
about to turn him over,

26:41.948 --> 26:43.253
Allen must be desperate

26:43.297 --> 26:44.603
to get even with
his enemies while he can.

26:44.646 --> 26:46.343
Or what if Allen has
Baratta and Russo

26:46.387 --> 26:48.389
aiming to stop the extradition
hearing from happening?

26:48.432 --> 26:49.738
By targeting
the judge.

26:49.782 --> 26:50.870
Do we have Allen's
extradition order?

26:56.702 --> 26:57.790
"Judge Mary Grant."

26:57.833 --> 26:59.443
She hasn't even signed off yet.

26:59.487 --> 27:00.836
Get her into police custody,
just to be safe.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.925
I'll call the courthouse.

27:19.028 --> 27:21.552
It's not the end of the world

27:21.596 --> 27:23.337
if you don't make
singles, honey.

27:23.380 --> 27:25.426
You and Sam will be
great doubles partners.

27:29.735 --> 27:31.780
Nice to see you, Judge.

27:48.318 --> 27:51.539
Hey. Deac told us Nichelle's
adoption fell through.

27:51.582 --> 27:54.411
- I'm so sorry, boss.
- Me, too.

27:54.455 --> 27:56.718
Of all the things
I prayed for--

27:56.762 --> 27:59.329
smooth delivery,
healthy child--

27:59.373 --> 28:01.592
birth mother keeping her word
was never on my list.

28:01.636 --> 28:03.333
And Nichelle
doesn't deserve this.

28:03.377 --> 28:05.335
She wanted this so bad,
Luca, and to be honest,

28:05.379 --> 28:07.729
seeing her joy lately, I started
to feel the same way.

28:07.773 --> 28:09.731
Hey, Chris just spoke
to Judge Grant's housekeeper.

28:09.775 --> 28:11.167
She said the judge took her kid

28:11.211 --> 28:13.300
- to tennis practice.
- Do we know where?

28:13.343 --> 28:15.171
- Astor Park, west side courts.
- Let's move out.

28:18.609 --> 28:21.438
You really think they assembled
these explosives way out here?

28:21.482 --> 28:23.440
Well, this is the only garage
with a machine

28:23.484 --> 28:25.094
that'd mark those fittings
like that.

28:25.138 --> 28:26.661
You're the specialist.

28:31.492 --> 28:35.017
Robert Hicks, LAPD.
This is Agent Kaminski

28:35.061 --> 28:38.325
with the ATF. We got a couple
of questions if that's okay.

28:38.368 --> 28:40.327
This guy ever come in?

28:40.370 --> 28:42.372
Maybe pay to use an old piece
of machinery?

28:42.416 --> 28:44.418
Nope.

28:44.461 --> 28:46.899
You, uh, ever lay
eyes on that man?

28:46.942 --> 28:49.336
Yeah. Car bomb psycho.

28:49.379 --> 28:50.903
Saw him on TV.
Why you asking?

28:50.946 --> 28:52.339
Mind if we look

28:52.382 --> 28:54.080
at your recent security footage?

28:54.123 --> 28:55.603
Got a warrant?

28:55.646 --> 28:57.692
Got a pink slip
for every car on your lot?

29:01.043 --> 29:03.437
You rattled his cage.

29:03.480 --> 29:06.440
I'm gonna step out. Calling
for backup just to be safe.

29:08.616 --> 29:10.531
You got to turn your hips
at the baseline.

29:10.574 --> 29:12.620
Get your racquet back
and follow through.

29:37.863 --> 29:39.299
Don't start the engine!

29:40.387 --> 29:41.562
We're LAPD.

29:41.605 --> 29:42.737
Step out of the car, Judge.

29:42.781 --> 29:44.739
- Come with me.
- It's rigged!

29:44.783 --> 29:46.610
Get out now!
Over here! Over here! Come on! Come on!

29:46.654 --> 29:47.655
Everyone, go, go!

29:47.698 --> 29:48.830
- Go this way.
- Move back!

29:49.918 --> 29:51.790
Is that Baratta?

29:51.833 --> 29:53.574
Hondo, it's Baratta!

29:53.617 --> 29:55.315
Go! Go! Go!

29:55.358 --> 29:57.143
Baratta! LAPD!

29:57.186 --> 29:59.101
Deacon, hold.

29:59.145 --> 30:00.711
Come out of there
with your hands up now!

30:00.755 --> 30:02.365
We know
about your cancer diagnosis,

30:02.409 --> 30:04.237
that you don't have long.

30:04.280 --> 30:05.716
But you still got time
to set things straight

30:05.760 --> 30:07.327
if you step out
with your hands up!

30:07.370 --> 30:10.156
Sure you want me to do that?

30:12.854 --> 30:16.597
Hondo. If the mercury
in that vial tilts...

30:16.640 --> 30:19.078
20-David. I need a 50-yard
perimeter around that building.

30:19.121 --> 30:20.775
No one comes near.

30:20.819 --> 30:23.082
Hey, it doesn't have
- to end this way!
- Yeah.

30:23.125 --> 30:25.475
It does!
Okay, wait, wait!

30:25.519 --> 30:27.042
The twins, man.

30:27.086 --> 30:28.696
Look at me.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.698
I can get your boys
on the phone.

30:30.741 --> 30:32.656
That's who you're
doing this for, right?

30:32.700 --> 30:33.788
The money's for them.

30:33.832 --> 30:34.833
To leave something behind

30:34.876 --> 30:35.921
before you die.

30:36.922 --> 30:38.662
Do it then!

30:38.706 --> 30:41.840
Okay. I'm calling 'em right now.

30:41.883 --> 30:43.972
I just need you to keep
that hand steady for me.

30:44.016 --> 30:45.191
Luca, you got eyes?

30:45.234 --> 30:46.757
In position, Deac. Stand by.

30:47.802 --> 30:49.804
If I can separate

30:49.848 --> 30:52.763
the fuse from the explosive,
the bomb deactivates.

30:52.807 --> 30:54.156
Wait.

30:54.200 --> 30:55.505
You're gonna shoot the line?

30:55.549 --> 30:56.985
Might be the only way.

30:57.029 --> 30:59.205
They're not picking up!
They will.

30:59.248 --> 31:00.728
Just give it a second.
He's not gonna

31:00.771 --> 31:01.990
wait much longer.

31:02.034 --> 31:03.862
If I could
just get a clean shot.

31:03.905 --> 31:07.300
Tell my boys I did everything
I could to take care of 'em!

31:07.343 --> 31:08.431
He's gonna do it, Luca.
Take the shot.

31:08.475 --> 31:09.606
Come on.

31:13.784 --> 31:14.742
Suspect down.

31:14.785 --> 31:16.135
Send in the bomb squad.

31:16.178 --> 31:17.266
Move in! Now!

31:18.615 --> 31:21.705
- Stay down! Stay down!
- Stay down!

31:21.749 --> 31:23.011
It's just a graze wound.

31:23.055 --> 31:24.360
Nobody's dying today.

31:24.404 --> 31:25.405
Get your hands
behind your back.

31:25.448 --> 31:26.580
Go! Let's go!

31:30.192 --> 31:32.281
This is 20-David.

31:32.325 --> 31:34.370
Baratta's in custody.
We got him.

31:34.414 --> 31:35.415
We're Code 4.

31:35.458 --> 31:36.895
Who did you even call?

31:36.938 --> 31:39.114
Nobody, but he didn't know that.

31:42.988 --> 31:44.641
It's over, Baratta.

31:44.685 --> 31:47.688
No. It's not.

31:51.344 --> 31:53.824
- Hey.
- Hey. I got to bail on dinner tonight.

31:53.868 --> 31:56.044
If I don't show up
to Marta's hearing,

31:56.088 --> 31:58.046
I'm not sure
she'll have the guts to testify.

31:58.090 --> 32:00.440
You know these things
can last hours.

32:00.483 --> 32:01.876
Buy me a burger
some other time.

32:01.920 --> 32:04.357
- Rain check, okay?
- Okay.

32:07.795 --> 32:10.450
Cover units requested.
Just checking on their status.

32:10.493 --> 32:13.366
We're out in the middle
of nowhere past Route 139.

32:17.587 --> 32:18.980
Where's your friend?

32:19.024 --> 32:20.808
I thought you said
he'd be right back.

32:20.851 --> 32:23.202
Oh, he will be.
He just needed some air.

32:30.252 --> 32:32.515
Wait a minute. That's Russo.

32:33.429 --> 32:35.127
Whoa, whoa.

32:35.170 --> 32:37.259
Come here.
You're under arrest.

32:37.303 --> 32:39.348
I didn't know
he was making bombs

32:39.392 --> 32:41.829
when he first
came in here, I swear.

32:41.872 --> 32:43.613
But I heard him talking
to the other one on the phone.

32:43.657 --> 32:45.311
The psycho.

32:45.354 --> 32:48.140
He sent him pictures
of you guys coming up here

32:48.183 --> 32:49.576
before you even came in.

32:49.619 --> 32:51.230
You should check on your friend.

32:51.273 --> 32:52.883
What the hell
are you talking about?

32:52.927 --> 32:54.537
Said his name
- was Kaminski, right?
- That's right.

32:54.581 --> 32:56.931
I heard the psycho tell him
to take care of that guy.

32:58.019 --> 33:00.369
Officers are on the way.

33:00.413 --> 33:02.154
Kaminski!

33:02.197 --> 33:04.156
Look under your car!

33:04.199 --> 33:06.027
Relax.
What are you worried about?

33:06.071 --> 33:08.203
Russo was here when we showed
up. He had Baratta on the phone.

33:08.247 --> 33:10.031
He might be
targeting you.

33:10.075 --> 33:11.250
Check it.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.170
All clear.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.784
What was that?

33:25.525 --> 33:27.831
I need you to check
under my seat.

33:35.187 --> 33:37.493
There's an explosive.

33:39.495 --> 33:41.932
Do you see a silver coil?

33:44.109 --> 33:46.154
There's four of 'em.

33:46.198 --> 33:48.287
What are those?

33:48.330 --> 33:51.551
They're pressure sensors.
Son of a bitch.

33:51.594 --> 33:53.118
Baratta has changed up
his game again.

33:53.161 --> 33:54.554
I activated it

33:54.597 --> 33:56.077
when I sat down.

33:56.121 --> 33:57.600
If I get up, my car explodes.

33:57.644 --> 33:59.733
Hell, if I even shift my weight,
it may go up.

33:59.776 --> 34:01.213
What can I do?

34:01.256 --> 34:02.649
Just step away from the car.

34:02.692 --> 34:04.390
Backup's already on the way.

34:04.433 --> 34:07.132
Wait a minute.

34:07.175 --> 34:09.090
There's an egg timer on here.

34:09.134 --> 34:10.526
How much time is left on it?

34:10.570 --> 34:11.875
Six minutes.

34:11.919 --> 34:13.616
Oh.

34:13.660 --> 34:15.705
He's forcing me to sit here
because he wants me

34:15.749 --> 34:18.099
to live in the fear.
How deranged is that?

34:18.143 --> 34:20.623
Bob, please.
I'm not gonna ask you again.

34:20.667 --> 34:21.929
Get away from the car.

34:21.972 --> 34:24.323
- Is this your bomb kit?
- Hey.

34:24.366 --> 34:26.238
I'm gonna take that as a "yes."Don't even think about it.

34:26.281 --> 34:28.675
Bob? Bob, I didn't
think you were smart,

34:28.718 --> 34:30.372
but I didn't know
you were stupid.

34:30.416 --> 34:31.591
Now, you can't do this.

34:31.634 --> 34:33.593
I know I can't do this.

34:33.636 --> 34:35.421
That's why you're gonna
walk me through it.

34:41.949 --> 34:43.385
Damn, it Bob, just get away.

34:43.429 --> 34:44.821
The sooner you help me disarm
this thing,

34:44.865 --> 34:46.127
the sooner we get out of here.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.302
We're both in this
together now.

34:47.346 --> 34:48.477
All right,
listen to me.

34:48.521 --> 34:49.739
You've got to calm down.

34:49.783 --> 34:51.001
It you're gonna try to help,

34:51.045 --> 34:52.742
- calm down.
- I am calm.

34:52.786 --> 34:54.222
You're the one sitting

34:54.266 --> 34:55.832
on a bomb, Kaminski.

34:55.876 --> 34:58.226
No! No!

34:58.270 --> 34:59.619
Live explosives!

34:59.662 --> 35:01.142
Stay back, understand?

35:01.186 --> 35:04.145
Nobody come closer.

35:07.366 --> 35:10.456
Ooh. We got
under three minutes left.

35:10.499 --> 35:12.197
What do I do first?

35:12.240 --> 35:15.156
Somewhere you should find,
like, a small circuit board,

35:15.200 --> 35:17.898
uh, size of a half dollar.
See if you can find it.

35:17.941 --> 35:19.465
It's more like a checkbook.

35:19.508 --> 35:21.989
Wow. This guy's a lunatic.

35:22.032 --> 35:24.948
This is like some,
just, game to him.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.341
What's on the board?

35:26.385 --> 35:27.995
A red flashing light.

35:28.038 --> 35:30.432
A whole mess of wires--
orange, yellow, green.

35:30.476 --> 35:32.565
Colors don't matter.
What I need you to do is tell me

35:32.608 --> 35:34.567
which one is hot to the touch.

35:34.610 --> 35:36.177
Well, it's 90 degrees out.

35:36.221 --> 35:37.831
How am I gonna know
which one's hot?

35:37.874 --> 35:39.093
You'll know.

35:44.011 --> 35:46.492
Orange,

35:46.535 --> 35:50.104
I think. I don't know.
Maybe yellow.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.801
They're both hot.

35:51.845 --> 35:53.499
Trust your gut. Which one?

35:58.504 --> 36:00.984
Orange.

36:01.028 --> 36:05.424
All right. Take the small box
out of the kit

36:05.467 --> 36:07.382
and turn it on.

36:07.426 --> 36:09.428
All right, it's on.

36:09.471 --> 36:10.864
Attach the clamps

36:10.907 --> 36:12.257
to the orange wire

36:12.300 --> 36:13.649
two inches apart.

36:13.693 --> 36:15.782
- Okay, two inches.
- Do not allow

36:15.825 --> 36:17.523
those clamps
to touch any other wire.

36:17.566 --> 36:19.612
- Understand?
- I got this. I got it. My hand...

36:19.655 --> 36:21.831
- My-my hands are shaking.
- You'll be fine.

36:21.875 --> 36:23.877
Just take a deep breath.

36:23.920 --> 36:26.096
Close your eyes.
- Think happy memories.
- All right, I got it.

36:26.140 --> 36:27.446
Bob, think of happy thoughts.

36:27.489 --> 36:29.665
- I got it. I got it.
- All right.

36:31.014 --> 36:32.625
Uh...

36:36.106 --> 36:38.196
I've got one.

36:44.506 --> 36:45.464
Okay.

36:45.507 --> 36:47.248
The clamps are attached.

36:47.292 --> 36:49.555
All right, so now, just

36:49.598 --> 36:51.296
cut it in the middle--
the orange wire--

36:51.339 --> 36:53.254
- between the two clamps.
- Okay.

36:53.298 --> 36:54.429
I got it.

37:11.881 --> 37:13.274
I did it.

37:13.318 --> 37:16.103
Is that it? I think I did it.

37:17.322 --> 37:18.279
Did I do it?

37:18.323 --> 37:20.281
You did it.

37:22.022 --> 37:23.893
See? You did it.

37:27.157 --> 37:28.246
How's it feel?

37:28.289 --> 37:30.160
That was a bit of a rush.

37:31.161 --> 37:32.424
Oh, yeah.

37:34.730 --> 37:36.297
Hey.

37:36.341 --> 37:38.299
How'd it go at the courthouse?

37:38.343 --> 37:40.519
Tan filled me in on the girl
you've been trying to help.

37:40.562 --> 37:42.085
I got there just
in time for Marta

37:42.129 --> 37:44.087
to speak
to the immigration panel.

37:44.131 --> 37:46.046
She did about as well
as I could've hoped.

37:46.089 --> 37:48.527
She, uh, told them the truth.

37:48.570 --> 37:50.746
When will you know whether or
not she's been granted asylum?

37:50.790 --> 37:52.487
You know how the court works.

37:52.531 --> 37:54.097
It could be a week,
could be months.

37:54.141 --> 37:56.317
Doesn't seem fair.
The thought of her getting

37:56.361 --> 37:58.406
sent back to El Salvador, to
what's waiting for her there.

37:58.450 --> 38:00.321
Well, you've done everything
you can to help this girl.

38:00.365 --> 38:03.281
So why do I feel like
- I should be doing more?
- Because

38:03.324 --> 38:04.673
you know that
there'll never be a shortage

38:04.717 --> 38:06.458
of people that need help.

38:06.501 --> 38:08.982
You've got a very deep sense
of service.

38:09.025 --> 38:11.027
Deeper than anyone I know.

38:11.071 --> 38:13.987
You're a good cop, Chris.
A great cop.

38:14.030 --> 38:16.337
Just hope you can admit that
to yourself sometimes.

38:30.046 --> 38:32.005
Hey. I'm taking off.

38:32.048 --> 38:34.007
Just wanted to say
thank you for everything.

38:34.050 --> 38:35.574
Ah, don't mention it.

38:35.617 --> 38:37.793
You know, they picked Russo
and his girlfriend up

38:37.837 --> 38:40.274
- at an airport in Ventura.
- Yeah, I heard.

38:40.318 --> 38:42.537
Baratta's saying
he did all this for his kids.

38:42.581 --> 38:44.887
Said he wanted to have something
to leave 'em.

38:44.931 --> 38:46.454
A demented,
blood-money nest egg.

38:46.498 --> 38:47.890
I haven't had

38:47.934 --> 38:50.850
a day like that
in a long, long time.

38:50.893 --> 38:53.418
Hope I never have
a day like that again.

38:53.461 --> 38:55.507
Hey, um...

38:57.291 --> 38:59.075
...I'm sorry for what I said.

38:59.119 --> 39:02.470
Yeah. So am I.

39:02.514 --> 39:04.472
I'll see you around.

39:04.516 --> 39:06.518
Yeah.

39:06.561 --> 39:08.911
It's been a real blast, huh?

39:08.955 --> 39:11.740
Hey, Ray?

39:15.440 --> 39:17.398
I was a good husband to her.

39:17.442 --> 39:19.487
I know.

39:33.283 --> 39:35.285
Baby.

39:37.418 --> 39:39.377
Oh.

39:41.422 --> 39:44.207
I can't even begin
to tell you how sorry I am.

39:45.208 --> 39:48.429
This was out of your control.

39:48.473 --> 39:50.649
You did nothing
to deserve this.

39:50.692 --> 39:52.781
I know I didn't lose a child,

39:52.825 --> 39:55.828
because I never
had a child to lose.

39:55.871 --> 39:58.308
So why does it feel like I did?

39:59.309 --> 40:02.008
- This pain.
- No.

40:02.051 --> 40:06.882
I love children, but maybe I'm
just not cut out to be a mother.

40:06.926 --> 40:08.449
No, no, don't say that.

40:08.493 --> 40:12.018
- Why not? It's true.
- Look at me.

40:12.061 --> 40:14.020
It is not true.

40:14.063 --> 40:16.022
No woman on this planet
is more prepared

40:16.065 --> 40:17.806
to be a mother than you are.

40:17.850 --> 40:21.506
Nichelle, you are
so thoughtful,

40:21.549 --> 40:24.334
you're an amazing teacher,

40:24.378 --> 40:27.903
and you make a mean PB&J.

40:27.947 --> 40:30.166
I withdrew my name
from consideration

40:30.210 --> 40:31.777
with the adoption agency.

40:31.820 --> 40:34.649
I can't ever go through
something like this again.

40:37.217 --> 40:39.393
Hey.

40:43.528 --> 40:46.052
Let's have a kid together.

40:48.054 --> 40:50.404
Don't say that just
to make me feel better.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.450
I'm not saying it
to make you feel better.

40:52.493 --> 40:55.583
And I'm sorry it took today
to make me realize it.

40:57.367 --> 41:00.283
I've been thinking a lot
about us,

41:00.327 --> 41:03.330
our life together.

41:03.373 --> 41:05.114
There's nothing I want more.

41:05.158 --> 41:07.116
I'm not as young

41:07.160 --> 41:09.336
as most women are when
they have their first child.

41:09.379 --> 41:11.251
Okay, well, look at me.

41:11.294 --> 41:14.515
I'm not as young
as most men, but so what?

41:15.560 --> 41:18.911
So it might be a process.

41:18.954 --> 41:22.131
You want someone to go
through that process with?

41:25.526 --> 41:27.833
I want to have a family
with you.

41:28.921 --> 41:30.966
What do you want?

41:31.967 --> 41:34.753
I want the same thing.

41:43.413 --> 41:44.893
Me and you.

41:44.937 --> 41:47.113
We're gonna be okay.

41:47.156 --> 41:48.680
Yeah.
