03:11.608 --> 03:12.860
Who are all these people?

03:14.152 --> 03:15.153
No clue.

03:35.299 --> 03:37.259
- Good morning, everybody.
- Morning.

03:37.259 --> 03:38.218
- Morning.
- Morning.

03:39.178 --> 03:41.930
So, like I said before,
this is just a formality. Okay?

03:42.556 --> 03:45.267
You guys go in there
and apologize for how you handled it.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.395
That's it.
This will all be behind us. Okay?

03:50.564 --> 03:51.648
We all on the same page?

03:54.526 --> 03:55.819
You all right?

03:57.321 --> 03:59.031
All right. Let's go do it.

04:08.624 --> 04:09.958
Hello, everyone.

04:09.958 --> 04:13.253
On behalf of the Maryland Unified
Athletic Council, good morning.

04:13.962 --> 04:18.675
We all know the reason we're here.
And my understanding is,

04:18.675 --> 04:23.055
the young men-- the players--
have something they would like to say.

04:42.574 --> 04:43.575
Hello.

04:48.288 --> 04:51.917
As you all know, I'm Jace Carson.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.381
Getting back on the court...

05:01.051 --> 05:02.094
means a lot to me.

05:05.138 --> 05:07.891
Not just because of college...

05:11.520 --> 05:12.521
or my future...

05:17.317 --> 05:18.485
or even my teammates.

05:25.951 --> 05:32.833
But because being on the court is where
I feel most like myself.

05:34.668 --> 05:35.669
It's what I love.

05:37.296 --> 05:43.385
And I understand that if I apologize

05:45.262 --> 05:46.930
for something I did...

05:50.559 --> 05:52.060
when I was 14 years old,

05:53.729 --> 05:55.147
I can get what I love back.

06:00.110 --> 06:03.405
What we did wasn't right.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.038
But...

06:13.999 --> 06:15.375
I don't know if it was wrong.

06:29.014 --> 06:33.018
I'm sorry
that there weren't systems in place

06:33.018 --> 06:35.395
to better protect Crystal Jarrett.

06:42.402 --> 06:43.403
But for what I did...

06:52.913 --> 06:54.748
I can't apologize.

06:59.211 --> 07:00.212
Good job.

07:00.796 --> 07:03.215
Okay, everyone. Just a minute, please.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.968
Just a minute, please.

07:07.427 --> 07:09.847
I'm so proud of you. You did it.

07:13.725 --> 07:15.060
Is this how you all feel?

07:15.686 --> 07:16.854
It's okay.

07:33.370 --> 07:34.746
Yes, sir.

07:50.512 --> 07:51.513
Yes, sir.

08:01.481 --> 08:02.482
Yes, sir.

08:11.325 --> 08:12.326
You okay?

08:13.994 --> 08:14.995
Proud as hell.

08:27.633 --> 08:28.800
Twenty-four-hour people.

08:30.719 --> 08:31.720
Yeah.

08:34.097 --> 08:37.851
Yes. Yeah. I understand.
Okay. I will call you back. Thank you.

08:39.977 --> 08:42.813
So let me guess. You had no idea
they were gonna do that in there.

08:42.813 --> 08:43.857
Of course I didn't.

08:43.857 --> 08:46.276
The board was ready to reinstate them

08:46.276 --> 08:48.362
and they just tossed up
eight middle fingers, Meg.

08:50.197 --> 08:52.282
Okay. So, what now?

08:56.161 --> 08:58.288
The final decision
is pending further review.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.874
Look, I'll get back with the committee,

09:00.874 --> 09:03.669
but I really don't know
how much more I can do.

09:06.296 --> 09:07.714
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much.

09:09.716 --> 09:11.009
A lot of surprised faces.

09:13.971 --> 09:14.805
Yeah.

09:14.805 --> 09:17.391
I'm not a believer
in "the sky is falling," Ike,

09:17.391 --> 09:19.601
but it does feel like the sky is falling.

09:19.601 --> 09:23.814
Everyone who was recruiting Jace
has gone silent, and now this.

09:23.814 --> 09:24.898
From where I was sitting,

09:26.483 --> 09:29.444
that was a young man in there
that I deeply respect.

09:30.112 --> 09:31.113
Okay?

09:31.613 --> 09:35.284
And I think those who matter
will still believe in Jace.

09:36.243 --> 09:40.455
- Those who don't, don't matter. All right?
- Don't matter.

09:41.498 --> 09:45.169
It's nice to see you in person,
instead of on a Zoom screen.

09:46.378 --> 09:48.005
Yeah. Three dimensions is...

09:49.756 --> 09:51.258
definitely better than two.

09:52.634 --> 09:57.389
I've been tracking the events. The video.

09:58.473 --> 09:59.725
How are you handling it all?

10:01.310 --> 10:02.311
I don't know.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.231
I guess,

10:07.399 --> 10:11.403
I just don't take the time
to think about that.

10:15.324 --> 10:20.162
But as I sit here now,
I think I'm handling it okay.

10:24.374 --> 10:29.254
Not gonna lie, there was a moment when I...

10:34.510 --> 10:35.511
Just...

10:38.055 --> 10:39.473
seeing his face...

10:42.017 --> 10:43.644
seeing his name,

10:45.312 --> 10:49.358
hearing it over and over...

10:49.358 --> 10:51.026
It brought you right back.

10:55.364 --> 10:56.448
It was scary.

11:00.452 --> 11:02.454
Just when I thought I had gotten past it,

11:03.205 --> 11:05.457
it seemed like
there was nothing I could do.

11:07.876 --> 11:14.258
Like I was destined to only be remembered
as the girl who survived abuse.

11:16.760 --> 11:21.890
I think how you handled it
will inspire a lot of people.

11:22.891 --> 11:25.644
You took something terrifying
and traumatic

11:25.644 --> 11:28.313
and you turned it
into something empowering.

11:28.313 --> 11:31.024
Not just for yourself, but for others.

11:34.570 --> 11:35.821
How is the young man?

11:37.447 --> 11:38.615
Who? Rod?

11:42.035 --> 11:42.870
Jace?

11:48.041 --> 11:52.129
I'm not here to talk about him. Right?

11:52.754 --> 11:54.798
We can talk about whatever you like.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.596
All I know is,

12:02.264 --> 12:05.893
right now, it's strange because...

12:07.686 --> 12:11.815
after everything that happened...

12:14.318 --> 12:17.446
I actually feel more like myself
than ever before.

12:20.782 --> 12:23.076
True life awakens when we awaken.

12:25.037 --> 12:27.706
That's what it feels like right now.

12:39.426 --> 12:40.511
Jace.

12:48.185 --> 12:49.311
What are you doing?

12:54.775 --> 12:55.776
Mom, it's okay.

13:01.615 --> 13:02.616
You can talk to me.

13:17.840 --> 13:24.096
If it's cool with you,
I don't wanna go to school today.

13:28.350 --> 13:31.895
I'll call your dean
and say you're taking a mental health day.

13:32.855 --> 13:33.856
Thank you.

13:37.192 --> 13:38.193
I was thinking.

13:38.902 --> 13:42.573
My big Holly Ann Conference
this weekend is in New Jersey...

13:42.573 --> 13:43.782
That's a big deal.

13:44.867 --> 13:46.702
It's huge just to get invited.

13:47.536 --> 13:50.080
They're honoring the top consultants
in the nation--

13:50.080 --> 13:52.916
- They better honor you then.
- I don't know. We'll see.

13:58.672 --> 14:00.007
Maybe you should come with me.

14:01.592 --> 14:06.013
Might be nice to get away.
A little room to breathe.

14:10.851 --> 14:12.102
Can I let you know later on?

14:14.855 --> 14:15.856
Sure.

14:16.982 --> 14:17.816
Thanks, Mom.

14:25.866 --> 14:26.867
Yeah.

14:27.367 --> 14:29.661
Nothing has changed, Coach.

14:29.661 --> 14:30.787
<i>I like the kid,</i>

14:30.787 --> 14:34.708
<i>but it's my job to be worried about some
of this, you know, off-the-court stuff.</i>

14:34.708 --> 14:40.255
Look, all right, he's a great kid
and a great player. I assure you of that.

14:40.797 --> 14:43.509
<i>Who shoots barely 20% from three.</i>

14:43.509 --> 14:44.927
He'll work on that.

14:45.427 --> 14:49.640
<i>Then I have to ask, why is your own
athletic director telling me</i>

14:49.640 --> 14:52.059
<i>I would be smart
to steer clear of the kid?</i>

14:53.852 --> 14:55.437
What exactly did he say?

14:55.437 --> 14:57.481
<i>"Not worth the headache."</i>

14:58.732 --> 15:01.109
<i>Hey, Ike. Look, I gotta run. We'll talk.</i>

15:02.110 --> 15:03.111
All right.

15:10.953 --> 15:11.954
I'ma curse Emory out.

15:11.954 --> 15:13.121
No, you're not.

15:13.121 --> 15:15.290
Okay, baby, let's go. Time for school.

15:15.290 --> 15:16.500
Okay, Mommy.

15:16.500 --> 15:20.963
How is an athletic director gonna
go around bad-mouthing a student athlete

15:20.963 --> 15:22.297
who's already against the ropes?

15:23.215 --> 15:25.384
Some people punch down. I punch up.

15:25.384 --> 15:27.886
No punching will be necessary.

15:27.886 --> 15:31.515
I have a meeting scheduled with Emory
later today to discuss Jace and the boys.

15:32.099 --> 15:33.392
You got a meeting about my team?

15:33.392 --> 15:34.560
I see it as a diversity issue.

15:34.560 --> 15:36.854
He's gonna see it
as me hiding behind my wife.

15:36.854 --> 15:40.607
Even if I wasn't married to you,
I would still take the meeting. Okay?

15:41.441 --> 15:42.609
Male Black ego.

15:44.236 --> 15:45.612
Okay.

15:45.612 --> 15:48.657
Can we go now?
I have to go curse somebody out.

16:08.051 --> 16:09.344
Hello.

16:09.344 --> 16:12.389
- <i>Hi. Is this Crystal Jarrett?</i>
- Yes.

16:12.389 --> 16:14.933
<i>Hi. This is Vicky Sirota.</i>

16:14.933 --> 16:17.811
<i>I'm a rep from
the McDonald's All-American game.</i>

16:17.811 --> 16:19.771
<i>Normally we would reach out to your coach,</i>

16:19.771 --> 16:24.193
<i>but in your particular case,
I really wanted to call you personally.</i>

16:24.902 --> 16:29.281
<i>So, the selection committee had
a lot of hard choices to make this year,</i>

16:29.281 --> 16:34.077
<i>but we believe you are one of
the top basketball players in the nation.</i>

16:34.077 --> 16:36.496
<i>So, luckily,
this is one of the good calls.</i>

16:36.496 --> 16:40.334
<i>Congratulations. You've been named
a McDonald's All-American.</i>

16:40.334 --> 16:42.961
Let's go!

16:54.932 --> 16:55.766
Yo.

16:56.266 --> 16:57.643
<i>What are you doing, scrub?</i>

16:57.643 --> 17:02.022
Staying home today. Too stressed.
Why do you sound so energetic?

17:02.022 --> 17:03.565
Get dressed.

17:04.066 --> 17:05.317
<i>What?</i>

17:05.943 --> 17:09.695
Yo. Let's figure out a way
to handle your stress.

17:09.695 --> 17:10.781
I'm coming to pick you up.

17:19.998 --> 17:21.750
I just couldn't apologize.

17:21.750 --> 17:24.127
Dude, you are not trying to make it easy
for yourself, are you?

17:24.127 --> 17:29.007
You're my best friend.
I'm not gonna apologize for that.

17:34.555 --> 17:35.722
Where are we going?

17:35.722 --> 17:37.391
It's a surprise.

17:37.391 --> 17:39.852
Better not be some nasty vegan spot.

17:41.436 --> 17:42.896
Vegan hate is played out.

17:48.819 --> 17:49.820
Hey. So--

17:49.820 --> 17:53.031
I still haven't heard about
this McDonald's All-American game.

17:53.031 --> 17:53.949
What?

17:54.825 --> 17:57.661
Heard they reach out to people
personally before the public announcement.

18:01.248 --> 18:03.876
I think the controversy
could have something to do with it.

18:06.295 --> 18:08.297
How about we not think
about any of that today?

18:11.133 --> 18:12.134
Are you serious?

18:16.388 --> 18:18.182
Have you ever even been inside this place,

18:18.182 --> 18:20.184
or you just hit people
with balloons out front?

18:20.184 --> 18:23.353
Consider this a do-over for me
being late to your ninth birthday party.

18:34.489 --> 18:37.534
Welcome to Old School Week. This is
your captain and chief in command,

18:37.534 --> 18:40.662
DJ Cliff, bringing you back
to when music was pure.

18:45.250 --> 18:48.837
The style was happening
and love was a rallying cry, baby.

18:53.509 --> 18:58.931
How are people in here so early?
I mean, don't they got school or jobs?

18:59.640 --> 19:01.141
Not during Old School Week.

19:04.394 --> 19:08.565
Should we learn some choreography?
Like, look at that.

19:08.565 --> 19:11.276
Nah. I like to keep my shit organic.

19:18.075 --> 19:19.535
Peace and love. Size?

19:20.035 --> 19:21.411
Nine, please.

19:21.411 --> 19:22.829
- Thirteen.
- Right on.

19:24.873 --> 19:26.291
I might be a little rusty.

19:26.792 --> 19:29.211
Don't worry.
You were not good to begin with.

19:29.878 --> 19:30.879
Better than you.

19:33.048 --> 19:34.341
You're gonna learn today.

19:34.341 --> 19:36.343
Look, roller skating is just like life.

19:36.343 --> 19:39.680
The more chances you take,
the more at risk you are to fall.

19:41.014 --> 19:42.474
Or you can hold onto the wall.

19:43.475 --> 19:44.393
That's deep.

19:44.893 --> 19:45.978
And it rhymes.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.021
Thank you.

20:03.287 --> 20:05.539
I could actually rock this hat
in real life.

20:06.456 --> 20:08.458
- It does look really good on you.
- That's what I'm saying.

20:10.544 --> 20:11.545
Come on. Let's go.

20:14.089 --> 20:15.382
Nice moves, my man.

20:15.382 --> 20:18.385
Okay, now, beautiful soul flower.
I see you, baby girl.

20:19.261 --> 20:21.680
Foxy lovers. Let's boogie down.

20:22.931 --> 20:25.392
I see you soul brother
and soul sister number one.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.060
Wait. Is he talking about us?

20:27.060 --> 20:29.062
Y'all look like
you got the world on your shoulders.

20:29.062 --> 20:31.607
Go ahead and leave that outside.
Be free and let's dance.

20:38.530 --> 20:39.364
All right.

20:45.329 --> 20:46.496
You don't know where I'm at.

20:46.997 --> 20:50.000
- Where I'm at, huh?
- Hey, you better be careful.

20:51.293 --> 20:52.961
My legs are dead right now.

20:53.462 --> 20:54.755
Excuses.

20:55.339 --> 20:56.507
Excuses?

20:58.091 --> 20:59.593
I ran the hill yesterday.

20:59.593 --> 21:03.388
I ran yesterday and today.
You don't see me complaining about it.

21:03.388 --> 21:06.642
- Whatever, Miss Jarrett.
- Peace and love, Jace Carson.

21:11.313 --> 21:13.232
I don't know why you're trying
to race me right now.

21:18.153 --> 21:19.154
Miss Jarrett.

21:20.739 --> 21:21.823
Where you going, Miss Jarrett?

21:21.823 --> 21:22.866
Wait.

21:26.036 --> 21:27.913
- Don't drag me down with you. Come on.
- I got you.

21:31.375 --> 21:32.376
Come here.

21:33.085 --> 21:34.086
Hey.

21:34.586 --> 21:36.713
Smooth. How you like this?

21:38.048 --> 21:39.049
Better.

21:54.022 --> 21:57.317
Yeah. Great. Hey.

21:59.987 --> 22:01.071
Yeah.

22:01.071 --> 22:03.115
Yes. You nailed it.

22:11.164 --> 22:12.541
That's what I was saying.

22:12.541 --> 22:14.751
You know what I'm saying? It was just a--

22:15.335 --> 22:17.045
- My bad.
- Oops, sorry. Are you okay?

22:17.629 --> 22:19.882
- Yeah, sorry. I should've been looking.
- Nah, nah. It's all good.

22:19.882 --> 22:22.718
It's my fault. I'm Musa.

22:23.969 --> 22:24.970
V.

22:24.970 --> 22:26.221
Nice to meet you.

22:26.221 --> 22:27.598
You too.

22:29.308 --> 22:30.601
- All right, y'all.
- Yeah. Later.

22:30.601 --> 22:34.188
If you're not talking about
the basketball team or your next vacation

22:34.188 --> 22:37.524
or the expensive new cars your parents
are buying you, you don't fit in.

22:38.567 --> 22:42.696
And if you don't fit in at a place like
Cedar Cove, it's worse than being bullied.

22:44.198 --> 22:45.449
You feel invisible.

22:48.076 --> 22:49.244
I am invisible.

22:54.124 --> 22:55.751
To the Black students as well?

22:55.751 --> 22:57.085
To Black boys, I am.

22:58.712 --> 23:02.883
I literally just bumped into Musa Rahaim,
and he was a perfect gentleman.

23:02.883 --> 23:04.551
And with all the stress
he must be feeling,

23:04.551 --> 23:07.179
he was kind enough
to introduce himself to me.

23:07.179 --> 23:09.223
Well, that must've helped you feel seen.

23:09.223 --> 23:11.892
I've had about six classes with him
since sophomore year,

23:11.892 --> 23:14.144
and this is the first time
we've ever spoke.

23:15.229 --> 23:16.230
You--

23:17.022 --> 23:18.565
Dr. Lawson, can you give us a minute?

23:18.565 --> 23:21.151
It's okay, Mrs. Edwards.
I have class next period.

23:23.820 --> 23:30.285
V. Know that I see you.
And I'll check in with you soon.

23:30.953 --> 23:32.663
- Thank you, Mrs. Edwards.
- Of course.

23:33.413 --> 23:34.581
Hi, Dr. Lawson.

23:34.581 --> 23:35.874
Hi, V.

23:36.625 --> 23:37.793
Please, have a seat.

23:39.920 --> 23:41.004
Everything okay with V?

23:42.714 --> 23:45.717
I think it will be. Have you ever had her
in one of your classes?

23:46.385 --> 23:49.638
Last semester. I taught a class called
"The History of War."

23:50.305 --> 23:52.975
She got a B-plus, if I'm not mistaken.

23:54.017 --> 23:56.603
Would've got an A but she rarely
participated in class discussion.

23:56.603 --> 23:57.688
History of War?

23:58.856 --> 24:02.526
AP class. The similarities
between constructing an army

24:02.526 --> 24:06.780
and constructing an athletic program are
not as far apart as one might assume.

24:10.284 --> 24:12.119
There are not many
athletic directors like you.

24:13.871 --> 24:15.163
You're impressive.

24:15.163 --> 24:16.623
When I heard you dropped by my office,

24:16.623 --> 24:18.917
I certainly didn't assume
I missed out on a compliment.

24:20.711 --> 24:23.505
It's because I came to talk
about Jace, Phil, Drew, and Musa.

24:25.591 --> 24:28.260
Four great young men
with very promising futures

24:28.260 --> 24:33.223
who may be able to reach your heights
if ever given the chance.

24:33.974 --> 24:35.934
It depends on where
they focus their energies.

24:37.102 --> 24:38.395
They've been treated like celebrities

24:38.395 --> 24:40.063
since they won a championship
in junior year.

24:40.063 --> 24:41.607
You resent them for that?

24:41.607 --> 24:44.067
There are responsibilities that come
with success.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.068
Right.

24:45.068 --> 24:47.487
And there are several people
who put themselves on the line

24:47.487 --> 24:50.908
to ensure they would have the opportunity
to succeed. I'm one of them.

24:51.742 --> 24:54.703
And as noble as Jace Carson
is presenting himself to be,

24:55.287 --> 24:58.081
he did not confess because he thought
it was the right thing to do.

24:58.832 --> 25:03.212
He confessed
because he thought his "athletic gifts"

25:03.212 --> 25:05.672
would camouflage his lack
of high moral fiber.

25:06.173 --> 25:09.927
You told a college
that he wasn't worth recruiting.

25:10.928 --> 25:14.765
That was because of
your nobility and high moral fiber.

25:14.765 --> 25:18.060
Or because your victory parade collided
with his decision-making.

25:20.229 --> 25:25.067
You know, speaking of impressive,
you are as well, Miss Edwards.

25:25.067 --> 25:26.151
Thank you.

25:26.652 --> 25:29.321
You were a social worker
before Ike got you the job?

25:31.949 --> 25:33.784
I landed this position on my own accord.

25:33.784 --> 25:36.328
Of course. I mean no disrespect.

25:36.328 --> 25:37.454
Of course not.

25:37.454 --> 25:40.290
To answer your question,
I don't revel in fanfare.

25:41.375 --> 25:46.004
I revel in the consistent advancement of
our students, particularly our athletes.

25:46.630 --> 25:51.134
You seem to be consistently impeding
on Jace Carson's advancement.

25:51.134 --> 25:54.471
Says the woman married to the
grand marshal of the Jace Carson parade.

25:59.601 --> 26:03.355
- It's been a pleasure getting to know you.
- Likewise. I appreciate that.

26:04.439 --> 26:05.649
It may be even more of a pleasure

26:05.649 --> 26:08.151
if you ever take the time
to get to know yourself.

26:26.336 --> 26:27.754
I should've cursed his ass out.

26:37.389 --> 26:40.767
Yo, that guy is my entire mood board.

26:42.144 --> 26:45.898
His bag is so big he gotta
pay extra just to check it.

26:45.898 --> 26:48.108
Yo, you are so dumb.

26:49.193 --> 26:52.196
No. Don't do that.
Don't touch my fries with that.

26:56.408 --> 26:57.409
Happy?

27:02.080 --> 27:05.375
You ever wish you knew
what was coming next

27:05.375 --> 27:07.127
so you wouldn't have to worry about it?

27:08.378 --> 27:12.758
Like, you'd just know
what was gonna happen?

27:14.468 --> 27:17.971
Yeah. But then I'm like, "Nah."

27:18.555 --> 27:20.307
It would take all the fun out of it.

27:22.976 --> 27:25.270
I don't know if I'm gonna be able
to play again.

27:25.771 --> 27:29.191
Or if these college coaches
are ever gonna come back.

27:31.735 --> 27:34.154
All of a sudden,
they're picking my game apart.

27:34.154 --> 27:39.535
Sometimes I wish I didn't care so much.

27:40.536 --> 27:44.581
Like, if I didn't care so much,

27:45.457 --> 27:49.211
I probably wouldn't lay awake
in bed at night,

27:49.211 --> 27:50.712
you know? Just--

27:51.296 --> 27:53.882
If I was just some dude, and not...

27:53.882 --> 27:55.342
Jace Carson?

27:56.927 --> 27:58.720
You would not be able to survive.

27:59.304 --> 28:00.514
What do you mean?

28:02.224 --> 28:03.725
Without the attention.

28:06.144 --> 28:09.106
Wow. So you trying to call me arrogant?

28:09.106 --> 28:10.357
You are arrogant.

28:10.357 --> 28:12.359
No. I'm ego-forward.

28:14.945 --> 28:16.113
Okay, scrub.

28:16.613 --> 28:17.739
I hate you.

28:22.661 --> 28:24.121
Can I get a picture?

28:26.665 --> 28:30.252
I am such a big fan of you
and everything you stand for.

28:30.252 --> 28:32.296
You mean more to me than you know.

28:33.005 --> 28:36.508
That means everything to me. Thank you.

28:38.510 --> 28:39.845
Make sure you take a couple.

28:42.514 --> 28:43.515
All right.

28:44.474 --> 28:48.437
Boom, bop, biggity, wow.

28:48.937 --> 28:50.606
- There you go.
- Thanks, Crystal.

28:50.606 --> 28:52.232
Thank you.

28:54.401 --> 28:56.570
Did that hurt your feelings?

28:56.570 --> 28:59.656
A little. 'Cause I wanna be
in the pictures with you.

29:00.282 --> 29:02.242
I think I can arrange that.

29:12.294 --> 29:13.295
You know,

29:13.295 --> 29:19.510
I never really told you this, but...

29:21.887 --> 29:24.306
After you transferred to Cedar Cove

29:24.890 --> 29:26.725
and we went our separate ways...

29:30.145 --> 29:31.605
I was really sad.

29:35.776 --> 29:37.069
I didn't know that.

29:39.446 --> 29:43.408
I always thought we said
we wanted to focus on ball.

29:44.493 --> 29:46.119
Maybe that was a mistake.

29:48.664 --> 29:49.998
I know I missed you.

29:54.586 --> 29:57.840
Yeah.
Well, I just needed someone to talk to.

29:58.340 --> 30:02.594
And Rod was someone who listened.

30:03.136 --> 30:07.808
He was nice, easy.

30:08.851 --> 30:13.730
Easy is good sometimes.
You wouldn't know about that.

30:14.982 --> 30:19.403
What's going on with-- How--

30:19.403 --> 30:23.073
How is that break y'all was taking?

30:24.950 --> 30:29.872
The break is officially broken.

30:32.583 --> 30:33.584
How come?

30:39.256 --> 30:40.257
He's not you.

30:46.763 --> 30:48.724
So, you know how we--

30:53.687 --> 30:55.063
Sorry, it's my mom.

30:55.814 --> 30:56.940
Better take it.

30:58.066 --> 30:59.234
Yeah, I'll be right back.

31:02.905 --> 31:05.657
- Hi, Mom.
- <i>It's loud. Where are you?</i>

31:05.657 --> 31:07.701
Sorry, I'm in the roller rink.

31:07.701 --> 31:08.994
<i>The roller rink?</i>

31:09.703 --> 31:13.582
<i>What happened to your mental health day?
Who are you with?</i>

31:18.712 --> 31:21.340
Okay, I can hear you now. What's going on?

31:22.341 --> 31:25.928
<i>I'm trying to lock down my hotel room
for the Holly Ann Convention</i>

31:25.928 --> 31:29.431
<i>and was wondering if I should get
the king-size bed or two fulls.</i>

31:32.518 --> 31:35.062
I really would love to support you,

31:35.062 --> 31:39.858
but I think I would just rather
stick around here for the weekend.

31:40.776 --> 31:42.027
<i>Are you sure?</i>

31:42.611 --> 31:44.029
I can handle myself for a night.

31:45.531 --> 31:47.032
<i>No wild parties.</i>

31:47.741 --> 31:48.742
You too.

31:51.328 --> 31:54.915
<i>It's good to hear you laughing.
Okay. I love you.</i>

31:56.625 --> 31:57.835
Good luck, Mom.

32:10.931 --> 32:12.015
What?

32:13.225 --> 32:14.351
Nothing.

32:16.562 --> 32:19.523
My mom is going out of town
for the weekend.

32:20.148 --> 32:21.233
Really?

32:23.151 --> 32:27.573
Yeah, you could
come over when she breaks out.

32:28.657 --> 32:30.033
If you want.

32:32.953 --> 32:37.124
No offense,
but I'm not trying to be in your rotation.

32:39.543 --> 32:41.211
It's not even like that.

32:50.971 --> 32:51.972
Interesting.

32:55.142 --> 32:56.476
Thought so too.

33:23.504 --> 33:25.255
You were about to say something.

33:26.590 --> 33:27.591
What?

33:28.175 --> 33:30.427
Earlier. About us.

33:33.096 --> 33:36.850
Oh, yeah. That.

33:45.442 --> 33:46.443
Come here.

34:39.705 --> 34:42.081
Yo! Congratulations.

34:46.170 --> 34:50.257
You see that girl over there?
She's a McDonald's All-American.

34:50.257 --> 34:54.553
Wow. Right on.
One vegan sundae, one regular?

34:54.553 --> 34:55.637
Appreciate it, man.

35:06.398 --> 35:07.816
Why aren't you freaking out?

35:08.734 --> 35:11.778
I don't know. I just--
I know you really wanted this too.

35:13.155 --> 35:14.156
I mean,

35:15.574 --> 35:22.122
I kind of figured when I didn't
get the call that I wasn't gonna make it.

35:26.752 --> 35:30.297
Wait. Did you get a call?

35:37.429 --> 35:42.059
I wasn't trying to...
Look, I was gonna tell you.

35:42.059 --> 35:44.561
Right, yeah. So, why didn't you?

35:45.229 --> 35:47.564
I just wanted us to have a good time.

35:50.317 --> 35:51.527
Jace.

35:51.527 --> 35:55.447
Same old Crystal.
Keeping it close to the vest.

36:02.120 --> 36:06.208
Same old Jace.
Always trying to control things.

36:07.459 --> 36:10.879
You don't see it, but sometimes,
it's not about you,

36:10.879 --> 36:14.383
or what you want,
or what you think is right or wrong.

36:14.383 --> 36:16.385
Controlling things? My bad.

36:16.385 --> 36:18.804
My dumb ass thought
we had each other's back.

36:22.432 --> 36:23.433
You should take that.

36:30.399 --> 36:31.525
'Sup, Coach.

36:39.449 --> 36:42.160
Bet. Let me hit you right back.

36:51.336 --> 36:52.588
Gotta get ready for my game.

36:53.172 --> 36:55.132
Wait, does that mean you're reinstated?

36:55.757 --> 36:58.510
- Yeah.
- That's great.

36:58.510 --> 37:00.721
- I gotta go.
- I can give you a ride.

37:01.305 --> 37:02.848
I'll take a Lyft.

37:13.275 --> 37:16.236
Looks like the M.U.A.C. didn't wanna be
on the wrong side of things.

37:16.236 --> 37:19.781
All the love our kids have been getting
on social media made them crumble.

37:19.781 --> 37:22.659
Well, it's nice to have the court
of public opinion in our favor for once.

37:22.659 --> 37:24.119
It was a gamble,

37:24.119 --> 37:26.121
but I was hoping it would go this way.

37:29.416 --> 37:30.459
Wait, did...

37:32.461 --> 37:34.588
Did you know they weren't gonna apologize?

37:40.594 --> 37:41.595
Well...

37:44.723 --> 37:46.683
Jace confided in me.

37:48.644 --> 37:50.979
I need him to know that he can trust me,

37:50.979 --> 37:52.648
so I kept his secret.

37:54.900 --> 37:56.109
Trust.

37:56.109 --> 37:57.653
I mean it's everything.

37:59.404 --> 38:02.741
But Musa's my son. How could you
keep me in the dark like this?

38:05.994 --> 38:06.995
I'm sorry.

38:31.019 --> 38:32.938
How y'all feel
about the sisters on campus?

38:41.780 --> 38:43.532
This your new motivational speech?

38:46.451 --> 38:49.997
Not a speech. Just a question.

38:50.664 --> 38:52.666
I feel really good about the sisters.

38:56.587 --> 38:58.088
So do I, Coach.

39:01.425 --> 39:05.554
"Sistas." Not "sisters."

39:10.100 --> 39:12.352
I'ma shut up now.

39:12.352 --> 39:13.770
All right, cool.

39:15.063 --> 39:19.276
Well, my wife says that some of them

39:19.276 --> 39:22.529
aren't quite feeling the love.

39:23.405 --> 39:27.534
Now, I'm not gonna tell y'all who to date
and who not to.

39:28.368 --> 39:32.831
But a lot of those sisters stood
with y'all when things jumped off.

39:34.625 --> 39:36.210
Now, this right here is gospel.

39:36.210 --> 39:38.921
If you see a sister-- and I mean,

39:39.588 --> 39:42.299
really see her...

39:44.510 --> 39:48.222
Man, she'll have your back forever.

39:53.560 --> 39:56.313
I co-sign what Coach says.

39:57.105 --> 39:59.691
And I'm taking that
from my players handbook.

39:59.691 --> 40:02.653
Not "players." "Playas."

40:06.698 --> 40:09.576
So that's where you got
that corny-ass line from.

40:09.576 --> 40:12.913
Hey. I don't know. It must be genetic.

40:14.873 --> 40:17.584
Look, now, I know that has nothing to do

40:17.584 --> 40:19.211
with what you're fixing
to do on the court.

40:19.211 --> 40:20.462
But that's okay.

40:20.462 --> 40:24.091
Being judged on and off the court
is something that we're used to.

40:24.091 --> 40:26.677
Now they're saying that we might
not even make playoffs,

40:26.677 --> 40:28.595
let alone win a national championship.

40:28.595 --> 40:31.473
Now, if we could just come together--

40:31.473 --> 40:34.810
not just as a team, but as a family,

40:35.310 --> 40:37.521
we'll be unbeatable.

40:39.356 --> 40:41.733
We'll be unbreakable.

40:42.734 --> 40:43.777
Musa.

40:44.361 --> 40:46.113
Now that was my motivational speech.

40:47.823 --> 40:48.740
Now, y'all, you know,

40:48.740 --> 40:51.785
I really miss the chant y'all used to do.

40:51.785 --> 40:53.787
I-- I don't-- I forget how it goes.

40:53.787 --> 40:57.749
But if y'all could just give me
that chant one more time.

40:57.749 --> 40:59.209
I could really use it, please.

40:59.209 --> 41:00.878
- I got you, Coach.
- Start it up, Nick.

41:03.130 --> 41:06.216
Yeah. Yeah!

41:07.384 --> 41:11.680
<i>We brothers, we brothers</i>

41:12.181 --> 41:17.477
- <i>We brothers, so strong</i>
- So what?

41:17.477 --> 41:21.481
- <i>We brothers, we brothers</i>
- And who are we?

41:21.481 --> 41:22.733
And who are we gonna be?

41:22.733 --> 41:26.028
- <i>We brothers, so strong</i>
- And who are we?

41:26.028 --> 41:29.615
<i>Ay, ay, ay
We brothers, ay, ay</i>

41:29.615 --> 41:33.202
<i>We brothers
Ay, ay, we brothers</i>

41:54.223 --> 41:55.057
Hey.

41:57.809 --> 41:58.810
Crys.

42:03.148 --> 42:04.149
I'm sorry.

42:06.944 --> 42:10.822
I'm sorry too. I should've told you.

42:10.822 --> 42:15.327
I just didn't want you to have
something else to feel bad about.

42:17.663 --> 42:21.625
I know. But I made it about me
when it should've been about you.

42:24.253 --> 42:28.841
No matter what happens to me,
I'll always be happy for you.

42:39.560 --> 42:41.645
And now,

42:41.645 --> 42:43.981
the moment we've all been waiting for.

42:44.481 --> 42:51.154
Proudly representing the D.C.,
Maryland, and Virginia area after years

42:51.154 --> 42:56.159
of providing stellar cosmetic
and skin care consultation.

42:56.869 --> 42:59.705
Taking the stage for the first time,

42:59.705 --> 43:05.586
this year's recipient of
the Holly Ann Lavender Lexus,

43:06.170 --> 43:09.214
Miss Jenna Carson!

43:12.259 --> 43:14.678
Oh, my God! Go!

43:50.339 --> 43:55.302
<i>All right, Mustang fans. Make some noise!</i>

43:57.387 --> 44:02.017
<i>And your Cedar Cove
starting five.</i>

44:02.017 --> 44:09.107
<i>At forward, senior, Nick Mendez!</i>

44:20.118 --> 44:27.125
<i>At point guard, senior, Musa Rahaim!</i>

44:34.007 --> 44:37.261
- Yeah.
- Go get 'em, Son.

44:37.261 --> 44:38.178
Yeah.

44:40.264 --> 44:41.473
Let's get it.

44:45.561 --> 44:52.568
<i>At shooting guard,
senior, Drew Murphy!</i>

44:53.068 --> 44:55.279
Let's go! All right, bud.

45:04.329 --> 45:11.336
<i>At center, senior, big Phil Marksby!</i>

45:11.336 --> 45:14.464
My bad!

45:23.015 --> 45:28.312
<i>At guard, your Cedar Cove team captain...</i>

45:28.812 --> 45:35.611
<i>senior, Jace Carson!</i>

45:58.258 --> 46:02.971
Jace Carson. Jace Carson.

46:04.556 --> 46:06.183
Jace Carson.

46:07.351 --> 46:09.102
Jace Carson.

46:10.562 --> 46:15.734
Jace Carson. Jace Carson.

46:35.796 --> 46:39.383
"Swagger" on three.
"Swagger" on me. One, two, three.

46:39.383 --> 46:40.467
Swagger!

47:10.455 --> 47:12.124
Come on, baby. Come on.

47:13.917 --> 47:15.711
Let's go, Jace. Let's go.

47:17.421 --> 47:19.548
- Play back!
- Play back! Wake up!

47:24.178 --> 47:25.679
- Come on, y'all. Come on.
- Hey, Drew!

47:26.263 --> 47:27.556
Channel it, Musa. Channel it.

47:34.188 --> 47:35.189
Phil!

47:47.451 --> 47:49.703
<i>Jace Carson!</i>

47:49.703 --> 47:50.996
Let's go!

47:57.628 --> 47:59.129
Come on! Yeah.

48:00.339 --> 48:01.173
I'm back!

48:01.757 --> 48:02.758
Yo!

48:04.259 --> 48:05.260
I'm back!

48:07.638 --> 48:09.014
- That's what I'm talking about!
- I'm back!

48:09.014 --> 48:10.182
That's what I'm talking about!

48:11.975 --> 48:13.435
- Hey!
- Get off the floor.

48:24.446 --> 48:25.864
Hey, scrub.

48:37.334 --> 48:39.419
Hi.

48:41.046 --> 48:42.256
Heard you had a good game.

48:45.008 --> 48:49.721
Yeah. I had 35 and a win.

48:52.224 --> 48:53.976
Do you wanna come inside?

48:55.060 --> 48:56.061
Yeah.

49:05.320 --> 49:06.530
This is a nice place.

49:08.907 --> 49:09.908
Yeah.

49:11.827 --> 49:13.745
It's kinda crazy
you've never been here before.

49:21.211 --> 49:22.212
Do you want some water?

49:24.256 --> 49:25.257
Sure.

49:56.496 --> 49:57.581
Thank you.

50:04.254 --> 50:05.380
It's good.

50:06.757 --> 50:08.675
Yeah. Good water.

50:21.647 --> 50:24.066
Do you wanna see my room?

51:00.185 --> 51:01.186
I won this one.

51:03.856 --> 51:05.357
And I won this one twice.

51:09.152 --> 51:13.907
Wow. That's some sappy shit.

51:17.035 --> 51:18.161
You think that's sappy?

51:21.331 --> 51:22.332
How's this?

51:23.750 --> 51:27.754
I love you. I love you, Crystal.

51:31.842 --> 51:34.636
Always have. Always will.

53:18.699 --> 53:19.825
I love you too.

53:39.887 --> 53:40.888
I've never...

53:44.099 --> 53:45.100
Gone all the way?

53:49.646 --> 53:50.981
Me neither.

53:53.233 --> 53:56.820
Wow. Jace Carson.

53:57.905 --> 53:58.906
Crystal Jarrett.
