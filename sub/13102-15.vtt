[intense music]

00:37.083 --> 00:39.333
(Franklin)
Michael?

00:39.417 --> 00:42.792
We needed you.
We couldn't stop him.

00:42.875 --> 00:45.208
We needed you.

00:45.292 --> 00:46.542
Aah!

00:49.292 --> 00:51.083
[man laughing]

00:52.125 --> 00:53.375
Who's out there?

00:54.625 --> 00:56.375
Who did this? Who are you?
Who are you?

00:56.458 --> 00:57.542
Who's out there?

00:57.625 --> 00:58.833
[man laughing]

01:00.167 --> 01:03.000
Nobody. Yes, yes, yes.

01:04.083 --> 01:06.292
'We did it all by ourselves.'

01:06.375 --> 01:08.833
It's not true.
It's, it's not true.

01:14.375 --> 01:15.625
Oh, don't fight it.

01:15.708 --> 01:17.333
No, you're not gonna win.

01:18.833 --> 01:21.750
The more you fight it,
the stronger it gets.

01:29.750 --> 01:30.792
Aah!

01:33.250 --> 01:35.125
[panting]

01:35.208 --> 01:36.708
L-Lyta?

01:38.833 --> 01:40.750
What are you doing here?

01:42.792 --> 01:46.125
I've decided to stop hiding
what the Vorlons did to me.

01:47.417 --> 01:49.667
I'm testing to see
what I can do.

01:49.750 --> 01:51.833
How far I can go.

01:52.875 --> 01:55.000
I had no idea.

01:55.083 --> 01:58.125
You shouldn't have woken up.

01:58.208 --> 02:00.875
This is just a dream.

02:00.958 --> 02:03.333
This never happened.

02:03.417 --> 02:04.375
Huh!

02:04.458 --> 02:06.542
[panting]

02:15.833 --> 02:17.042
[door opens]

02:21.000 --> 02:22.375
Don't move.

02:24.458 --> 02:27.500
Is that any way to welcome
the love of your life, Michael?

02:32.292 --> 02:33.875
(Kosh)
And so it begins.

02:33.958 --> 02:36.000
There is a hole in your mind.
What do you want?

02:36.083 --> 02:38.792
(G'Kar)
No one here
is exactly what he appears.

02:38.875 --> 02:40.708
(Sinclair)
Nothing's the same anymore.

02:40.792 --> 02:42.875
(Hague)
Commander Sinclair
is being reassigned.

02:42.958 --> 02:44.792
(Lorien)
Why don't you eliminate
the entire Narn Homeworld?

02:44.875 --> 02:47.792
(Elric)
I see a great hand
reaching out of a star.

02:47.875 --> 02:49.292
(Sebastian)
Who are you?

02:49.375 --> 02:50.458
(female #1)
President Clark has signed

02:50.542 --> 02:51.917
a decree today, declaring--

02:52.000 --> 02:53.208
(Sheridan)
These orders have forced us

02:53.292 --> 02:54.542
to declare independence.

02:54.625 --> 02:55.917
Unless your people
get off their

02:56.000 --> 02:57.333
encounter-suited butts
and do something..

02:57.417 --> 02:59.250
(male #1)
You're the one who was.

02:59.333 --> 03:01.333
(Kosh)
If you go to Z'ha'dum
you will die.

03:01.417 --> 03:02.833
(Lorien)
Why are you here?

03:02.917 --> 03:04.708
Do you have anything
worth living for?

03:04.792 --> 03:06.292
(Delenn)
I think of my beautiful city
in flames.

03:06.375 --> 03:07.917
(Sheridan)
Giants in the play ground.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.667
Now, get the hell
out of our galaxy .

03:09.750 --> 03:12.625
We are here to place
President Clark under arrest.

03:12.708 --> 03:15.750
[theme music]

03:43.875 --> 03:45.958
[music continues]

04:00.875 --> 04:02.333
Lise?

04:04.208 --> 04:05.583
How did you get in here?

04:05.667 --> 04:10.208
You gave me a copy of your
passcode back on Mars, remember?

04:10.292 --> 04:12.167
Right after you said,
"Listen, hon

04:12.250 --> 04:15.125
"I'm just going to Babylon 5
for a few weeks.

04:15.208 --> 04:17.542
"Gonna help them
get the place in shape.

04:17.625 --> 04:19.792
"Then I'm coming right back.

04:19.875 --> 04:22.417
"Meanwhile, you ever
want to come and see me

04:22.500 --> 04:24.250
here's a key to my place."

04:25.292 --> 04:27.458
I figured I'd surprise you.

04:27.542 --> 04:30.000
Didn't think I'd scare you
out of a year's growth.

04:30.083 --> 04:33.167
Oh. I'm alright.

04:33.250 --> 04:35.125
You didn't, uh..

04:35.208 --> 04:37.125
...see anyone just leave here,
did you?

04:37.208 --> 04:38.875
No, why?

04:38.958 --> 04:40.667
Was there another woman in here
with you?

04:40.750 --> 04:41.833
[chuckles]

04:41.917 --> 04:44.292
I sure as hell hope not.

04:44.375 --> 04:46.667
So, uh,
what are you doing here?

04:46.750 --> 04:48.833
Would you stop being
a detective long enough

04:48.917 --> 04:53.042
to stop asking questions
and say hello properly?

04:53.875 --> 04:55.167
[laughing]

04:59.792 --> 05:01.167
Hello.

05:01.250 --> 05:02.167
Hello.

05:02.250 --> 05:04.542
So, what are you doing here?

05:04.625 --> 05:06.375
Why do I need a reason?

05:06.458 --> 05:08.708
It's been a long time,
and I missed you.

05:08.792 --> 05:10.833
I wanted to see you.

05:10.917 --> 05:14.500
- You look like hell, Michael.
- I was asleep.

05:14.583 --> 05:16.583
You're usually up a hell
of a lot earlier than this

05:16.667 --> 05:19.792
or I wouldn't have
just walked in.

05:19.875 --> 05:21.167
Are you feeling okay?

05:21.250 --> 05:22.917
Yeah, I'm fine.
I was..

05:23.000 --> 05:25.458
I was going to get up
in a little while..

05:25.542 --> 05:27.708
...about an hour.

05:27.792 --> 05:29.667
An hour?

05:29.750 --> 05:32.125
About.

05:32.208 --> 05:33.625
Plenty of time.

05:33.708 --> 05:35.333
[chuckling]

05:41.958 --> 05:44.333
(man on radio)
'This is C and C.
Is Ambassador Delenn present?'

05:44.417 --> 05:45.625
Yes.

05:45.708 --> 05:47.083
'Message from Lennier
on a secure channel.'

05:47.167 --> 05:49.083
'Do you wish to accept?'

05:49.167 --> 05:51.500
Alright, send it to me here.

05:51.583 --> 05:52.917
'Stand by.'

05:53.000 --> 05:53.958
[beeps]

05:54.042 --> 05:55.292
Lennier?

05:55.375 --> 05:56.625
Delenn.

05:56.708 --> 05:58.125
I wanted you to know.

05:58.208 --> 06:00.458
There have been three more
attacks on Alliance ships

06:00.542 --> 06:03.583
in this area
in the last six days.

06:03.667 --> 06:04.792
Any survivors?

06:04.875 --> 06:08.250
'No. No survivors,
witnesses, or evidence.'

06:08.333 --> 06:10.042
The attacks
continue to be random.

06:10.125 --> 06:13.792
They're impossible to predict,
but..

06:13.875 --> 06:15.625
...I may have something.

06:15.708 --> 06:17.833
Twenty hours
prior to each attack

06:17.917 --> 06:20.292
we've intercepted
coded Centauri signals.

06:20.375 --> 06:23.125
Now I've yet to determine
their location.

06:23.208 --> 06:24.833
Or their destination.

06:24.917 --> 06:27.458
But I believe they may be
instructions for the attacks.

06:27.542 --> 06:29.792
They can be many things.

06:29.875 --> 06:31.125
We need proof, Lennier.

06:31.208 --> 06:33.417
Do you think
you can decode the signal?

06:33.500 --> 06:37.292
Yes, I-I, in time,
I think I can, but..

06:37.375 --> 06:39.792
...I only worry about how many
other lives will be lost

06:39.875 --> 06:41.917
the longer it takes me.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.250
Has Sheridan found out
about my mission yet?

06:44.333 --> 06:46.292
No. Fortunately,
he has been too busy

06:46.375 --> 06:48.542
keeping the Alliance
from falling apart.

06:48.625 --> 06:50.167
As soon as we have proof
that the Centauri

06:50.250 --> 06:51.750
are responsible
for these attacks.

06:51.833 --> 06:53.417
We will bring him into it.

06:53.500 --> 06:54.833
I understand.

06:55.708 --> 06:57.000
I should go now, Delenn.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.958
Captain Montoya
is expecting me on the bridge

06:59.042 --> 07:01.167
for the next training exercise.

07:01.250 --> 07:02.667
Be careful, Lennier.

07:02.750 --> 07:05.583
You're far too close to the
Centauri border for my comfort.

07:05.667 --> 07:07.042
I will.

07:07.125 --> 07:08.333
Be well.

07:08.417 --> 07:09.667
[beep]

07:20.500 --> 07:22.625
Now, I'm sorry,
Ms. Alexander, but

07:22.708 --> 07:23.917
there's nothing
we can do about it.

07:24.000 --> 07:26.167
I'm just
asking you to consider it.

07:26.250 --> 07:28.083
Imagine the possibilities.

07:28.167 --> 07:29.833
And all your company
has to do is provide us

07:29.917 --> 07:31.708
with a long-range explorer ship

07:31.792 --> 07:34.042
capable of holding
one or 200 telepaths.

07:34.125 --> 07:35.167
Rogue telepaths.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.250
Who will have an advantage

07:36.333 --> 07:38.125
no one else
has ever had before.

07:38.208 --> 07:40.000
Instant communication
with each other

07:40.083 --> 07:42.750
and whatever life forms
they happen to encounter.

07:42.833 --> 07:44.292
We have had teeps on board

07:44.375 --> 07:46.167
other deep-range
missions before.

07:46.250 --> 07:48.167
It is not a new idea.

07:48.250 --> 07:50.542
But the Psi Corps
will only let you have

07:50.625 --> 07:52.125
one telepath per ship

07:52.208 --> 07:54.917
and only to help out
during first contact.

07:55.000 --> 07:57.500
Look, your ships
keep to a tight schedule

07:57.583 --> 08:00.833
with only a few days at each new
planet to determine its value.

08:00.917 --> 08:03.917
With 200 telepaths
spreading out around a planet

08:04.000 --> 08:06.417
learning its resources
and culture

08:06.500 --> 08:08.833
you'd learn ten times
what any other crew could learn

08:08.917 --> 08:10.083
in the same amount of time.

08:10.167 --> 08:11.458
In exchange for?

08:11.542 --> 08:12.958
If they find a livable planet

08:13.042 --> 08:15.125
with no other
sentient life forms

08:15.208 --> 08:17.583
we get to form a colony
of our own.

08:17.667 --> 08:19.083
No.

08:19.167 --> 08:20.792
It's an interesting idea, but

08:20.875 --> 08:22.417
we're a big company,
Ms. Alexander

08:22.500 --> 08:25.833
and we employ a lot of telepaths
who belong to the Psi Corps.

08:25.917 --> 08:27.667
Well, they have to be
members of the corps

08:27.750 --> 08:29.833
or our insurance policy
wouldn't cover their activities.

08:29.917 --> 08:31.750
If I did what you asked

08:31.833 --> 08:34.250
well, I'd violate our contract
with the Psi Corps

08:34.333 --> 08:36.083
and, and they could
yank our people

08:36.167 --> 08:38.750
and, you know, it would put us
at a substantial disadvantage.

08:38.833 --> 08:40.583
We could get you
all the telepaths you need.

08:40.667 --> 08:42.875
But not the ones I want.

08:42.958 --> 08:44.750
Look, I understand your desire

08:44.833 --> 08:47.083
to create a homeworld
for telepaths.

08:47.167 --> 08:49.125
I'm not unsympathetic.

08:49.208 --> 08:50.292
But what you're asking is

08:50.375 --> 08:52.875
beyond the capabilities
of my company..

08:52.958 --> 08:54.833
...or any others.

08:54.917 --> 08:57.125
You need someone
with a lot more resources

08:57.208 --> 09:00.708
and no contractual obligations
to the Psi Corps.

09:00.792 --> 09:02.708
Good luck trying to find him.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.417
[beep]

09:14.500 --> 09:16.500

09:16.583 --> 09:19.500
Access public
scheduling databank.

09:19.583 --> 09:20.792
I wanna schedule an appointment

09:20.875 --> 09:22.083
for later this afternoon

09:22.167 --> 09:23.458
with one of the ambassadors.

09:23.542 --> 09:25.792
[automated voice]
'Identification required.'

09:25.875 --> 09:27.750
Ambassador G'Kar.

09:27.833 --> 09:29.708
[automated voice]
'Stand by.'

09:29.792 --> 09:32.250
And we've had another request
from the Royal Court

09:32.333 --> 09:34.375
for information
on the trade deals

09:34.458 --> 09:35.917
with the Alliance worlds.

09:36.000 --> 09:37.500
They would like the report

09:37.583 --> 09:39.500
of the timetables
and the shipments

09:39.583 --> 09:40.958
by today, if possible.

09:41.042 --> 09:42.375
Oh, I'm sure they would.

09:42.458 --> 09:43.792
They can wait.

09:43.875 --> 09:46.333
Besides, what difference
does it make to the Royal Court?

09:46.417 --> 09:48.750
They've never shown
any interest in this before.

09:48.833 --> 09:50.958
I only carry the message.

09:51.042 --> 09:54.125
I've given up trying to make
sense of anything long ago.

09:54.208 --> 09:56.125
Wise choice. What else?

09:56.208 --> 09:59.500
Uh, well, let's see, uh..

09:59.583 --> 10:01.667
Actually, nothing.

10:01.750 --> 10:03.208
What do you mean nothing?

10:03.292 --> 10:04.375
I thought
I had an appointment with

10:04.458 --> 10:06.500
the Drazi minister of finance?

10:06.583 --> 10:08.208
Well, it was canceled.

10:08.292 --> 10:10.750
Very well, what about the, uh,
the photo opportunity

10:10.833 --> 10:12.125
for the Gaim ambassador?

10:12.208 --> 10:13.750
They've kept after us
for months.

10:13.833 --> 10:15.167
It was either today or tomorrow.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.667
Canceled.
Everything's canceled.

10:17.750 --> 10:20.583
And you don't find this
in the least peculiar?

10:20.667 --> 10:22.958
Well, since the other members
of the Alliance said that

10:23.042 --> 10:24.708
they would take no more meetings

10:24.792 --> 10:27.167
until the problem
of the attacks are solved

10:27.250 --> 10:29.875
I, I just assumed that
everything was postponed.

10:29.958 --> 10:33.708
No. these are day-to-day
practical needs

10:33.792 --> 10:35.125
that have to be cared for

10:35.208 --> 10:38.333
regardless of one's position
with the Alliance.

10:38.417 --> 10:40.625
Then why would they cancel then?

10:40.708 --> 10:42.208
I don't know.

10:42.292 --> 10:44.750
You'd think they don't trust us.

10:44.833 --> 10:48.333
I don't think anyone trusts
anyone right now, Londo.

10:49.917 --> 10:52.042
You say that
as if it were a bad thing.

10:52.125 --> 10:54.333
No one really trusts anyone,
Vir.

10:54.417 --> 10:56.583
It is the natural order
of things.

10:56.667 --> 11:00.167
But until now, it has never
interfered with business.

11:00.250 --> 11:02.833
I find this very strange.

11:02.917 --> 11:05.542
Well, on the other hand, you
have the rest of the day free.

11:05.625 --> 11:07.292
I mean,
you can do whatever you want.

11:07.375 --> 11:09.083
It has been so long
since I heard those words.

11:09.167 --> 11:10.792
I don't know
what they mean anymore.

11:10.875 --> 11:12.750
Well,
you could go to the casino.

11:12.833 --> 11:15.625
Gambling no longer
has any appeal for me.

11:15.708 --> 11:17.292
When every day is a risk

11:17.375 --> 11:21.083
cards and dice are not quite as
interesting as they used to be.

11:21.167 --> 11:24.417
Well, I'm sure you'll find
something to occupy your time

11:24.500 --> 11:25.792
for the rest of the day.

11:25.875 --> 11:27.833
So, go-good day, Londo.

11:29.375 --> 11:31.458
[indistinct chatter]

11:33.167 --> 11:35.042
[laughter]

11:36.667 --> 11:39.792
(Garibaldi)
'Oh, great, thank you.
You used up all the hot water.'

11:39.875 --> 11:41.208
I did not.

11:41.292 --> 11:43.417
'Oh, then why are there icicles
hanging from my nose?'

11:43.500 --> 11:45.958
It must be the altitude.

11:46.042 --> 11:47.625
Or the attitude.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.167
I'm going to make some tea.
You want some?

11:50.250 --> 11:52.042
(Garibaldi)
'Sure.'

11:52.125 --> 11:56.167
I was thinking, and I've decided
what you need most right now

11:56.250 --> 11:58.667
is a dose of normality.

11:58.750 --> 12:01.250
So tonight, you have the honor

12:01.333 --> 12:03.458
of taking me out on a date.

12:03.542 --> 12:05.125
How does that sound?

12:05.208 --> 12:06.875
'Sounds fine.
Hey, I know a great place.'

12:06.958 --> 12:09.458
'They've only thrown me
out twice so far.'

12:09.542 --> 12:12.458
[instrumental music]

12:18.417 --> 12:19.875
(Garibaldi)
'That will wake you up.'

12:19.958 --> 12:22.125
'Hoo-hoo.'

12:22.208 --> 12:25.792
'Hello? You're kind of
quiet out there.'

12:25.875 --> 12:30.333
You must've found something
to watch on TV or..

12:30.417 --> 12:31.708
What..

12:33.625 --> 12:35.833
I think we should
talk about this, Michael.

12:35.917 --> 12:37.292
I don't.

12:37.375 --> 12:39.125
Michael.

12:39.208 --> 12:40.667
What, you come
all the way from Mars

12:40.750 --> 12:42.958
just to bust my chops
about that?

12:43.042 --> 12:44.333
Come on, it's nothing.

12:44.417 --> 12:45.833
Nothing?

12:45.917 --> 12:48.208
This stuff ruined your life
twice before.

12:48.292 --> 12:51.458
It took years to put it all back
together after the last time.

12:51.542 --> 12:53.958
I was a different person
back then, Lise, I..

12:57.083 --> 12:58.833
Listen to me..

12:58.917 --> 13:02.125
...back then,
I had nothing, I was a mess.

13:02.208 --> 13:04.458
I didn't know what I was doing.
I didn't know where I was going.

13:04.542 --> 13:06.000
My life was
completely screwed up.

13:06.083 --> 13:09.167
So, yeah,
yeah, I was out of control.

13:09.250 --> 13:10.458
But the thing about drinking
is one of us

13:10.542 --> 13:12.167
has got to be in control.

13:12.250 --> 13:14.667
And if it's not gonna be me,
it's going to be the booze.

13:16.042 --> 13:19.292
I am not the same person
that I was.

13:19.375 --> 13:21.708
I've got a good job now.

13:21.792 --> 13:24.875
I'm a war hero,
if you can believe that.

13:24.958 --> 13:26.542
I've got you.

13:27.417 --> 13:29.375
Then why is it here?

13:29.458 --> 13:31.875
When did you start
drinking again?

13:31.958 --> 13:33.542
A lot has happened
in the last six months.

13:33.625 --> 13:35.208
You wouldn't know
the half of it.

13:35.292 --> 13:38.208
I tried,
but you never returned my calls.

13:38.292 --> 13:40.375
It wasn't an accusation.

13:43.875 --> 13:47.875
No, no,
I didn't return your calls.

13:47.958 --> 13:49.542
I'm sorry.

13:51.542 --> 13:54.500
Lise, just,
tr-try to understand that I..

13:54.583 --> 13:58.500
...I have had my mind
messed with by Bester.

13:58.583 --> 14:00.167
I was captured
by the Mars resistance

14:00.250 --> 14:01.917
and I was within an inch
of being executed

14:02.000 --> 14:04.833
and there was nothing
that I could do about it.

14:04.917 --> 14:07.583
- I'm sorry.
- I don't want you to be sorry.

14:09.250 --> 14:11.917
I don't want anybody's pity.
I don't need anybody's pity.

14:12.000 --> 14:14.292
All I know is that
I am tired of being controlled.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.292
Controlled by others,
by fear, by my past

14:16.375 --> 14:20.083
by what everybody else
expects of me, and it's enough!

14:20.167 --> 14:21.625
It is enough!

14:23.625 --> 14:25.458
Now this

14:25.542 --> 14:30.125
this is my own private
little act of rebellion, yeah.

14:32.083 --> 14:34.042
I may not be able to control
what other people do to me.

14:34.125 --> 14:37.542
But I can at least be in control
of what I do to myself.

14:37.625 --> 14:39.292
So you don't mind
going off the road

14:39.375 --> 14:41.667
as long as you're behind
the wheel when it happens

14:41.750 --> 14:43.167
is that it?

14:44.667 --> 14:47.625
I'm not going
off the road this time.

14:47.708 --> 14:50.333
I told you,
I'm not the same person I was.

14:50.417 --> 14:52.292
This time, I'm in charge.

14:52.375 --> 14:53.708
Then show me.

14:53.792 --> 14:56.333
While I'm here, no booze.

14:57.792 --> 14:59.500
That'll make you happy?

14:59.583 --> 15:01.083
Not entirely.

15:01.167 --> 15:02.625
But it's a start.

15:07.208 --> 15:08.458
Okay.

15:11.375 --> 15:13.083
It's not a problem.

15:20.417 --> 15:23.250
[dramatic music]

15:29.083 --> 15:30.333
[beeping]

15:38.792 --> 15:40.125
There you are.

15:40.208 --> 15:42.083
I thought
you'd be getting some rest.

15:42.167 --> 15:44.167
I will rest later.

15:44.250 --> 15:46.583
What have you got there?

15:46.667 --> 15:48.833
A possibility.

15:48.917 --> 15:51.875
Captain, I've been thinking
about the coded signals

15:51.958 --> 15:54.375
we've been
intercepting from the Centauri.

15:54.458 --> 15:58.083
So far, I've only
been able to decode three words

15:58.167 --> 15:59.542
"Do Not Reply."

15:59.625 --> 16:02.000
It probably means they
have a ship out there somewhere

16:02.083 --> 16:03.750
and they don't want
anyone tracking the frequency

16:03.833 --> 16:05.333
to figure out
where they're going.

16:05.417 --> 16:07.375
That's what
I was thinking, at first.

16:07.458 --> 16:11.083
What if the signal
was going from a Centauri ship

16:11.167 --> 16:13.375
to a base of some kind?

16:14.542 --> 16:16.542
Good point.

16:16.625 --> 16:19.583
A stationary base
would be vulnerable.

16:19.667 --> 16:22.458
So you wouldn't want it to reply
and give away its location.

16:24.458 --> 16:26.792
Even if you were right,
what good does it do you?

16:26.875 --> 16:29.625
If they don't reply,
you can't track the signal.

16:29.708 --> 16:31.125
You can't find the base.

16:31.208 --> 16:33.208
That's what I was working on
when you came in.

16:33.292 --> 16:35.833
Communication in hyperspace
is very difficult.

16:35.917 --> 16:37.917
It requires
a great amount of power.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.000
To aid transmission,
a large base

16:40.083 --> 16:42.208
would keep a tachyon sub channel
or carrier wave

16:42.292 --> 16:44.792
going through the jump beacons
at all times.

16:44.875 --> 16:46.917
It's too faint
to pick up normally

16:47.000 --> 16:49.167
but if you catch it
at the exact moment

16:49.250 --> 16:50.625
that the larger signal
comes through

16:50.708 --> 16:53.125
then theoretically,
you could lock onto the signal

16:53.208 --> 16:55.292
and track it back to its source.

16:58.125 --> 17:00.292
It looks as if your theory's
going to stay just that.

17:00.375 --> 17:03.250
This is from Babylon 5.

17:03.333 --> 17:05.208
We've been recalled immediately.

17:05.292 --> 17:08.125
- Who gave the order?
- President Sheridan.

17:09.792 --> 17:12.000
(Delenn)
Why did you recall
White Star 27?

17:12.083 --> 17:13.750
Because I found out
it was operating

17:13.833 --> 17:16.833
on the border of Centauri space
without my knowledge.

17:16.917 --> 17:17.917
As head of the rangers

17:18.000 --> 17:19.083
I have discretionary power

17:19.167 --> 17:20.667
over their assignments.

17:20.750 --> 17:23.375
I placed them there as part
of their training maneuvers.

17:23.458 --> 17:25.458
And you assigned
Lennier to the crew

17:25.542 --> 17:28.125
on a covert mission
to spy on them.

17:28.208 --> 17:30.167
Delenn,
it's absolutely inappropriate

17:30.250 --> 17:33.292
of you to pull a stunt
like that without telling me.

17:33.375 --> 17:35.750
- I cannot have you making--
- You are right.

17:39.583 --> 17:40.667
Uh..

17:42.542 --> 17:44.292
Oh, damn it, Delenn.

17:44.375 --> 17:46.458
I have been working up
a good mad all day

17:46.542 --> 17:49.542
and I'm not about to let you
undercut it by agreeing with me.

17:49.625 --> 17:52.083
It was inappropriate
for me to assign Lennier

17:52.167 --> 17:54.292
to that part of space
without informing you

17:54.375 --> 17:58.417
just as it was inappropriate
for you not to assign him there.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.833
I admitted mine
with perfect honesty.

18:00.917 --> 18:02.833
Now you can admit yours.

18:02.917 --> 18:05.042
Absolutely not.

18:05.125 --> 18:07.125
For starters, it's unnecessary.

18:07.208 --> 18:09.167
We have plenty of patrols
there already.

18:09.250 --> 18:12.458
'Lennier knows more about the
Centauri than any other ranger.'

18:12.542 --> 18:15.708
He will catch things
that the others would miss.

18:15.792 --> 18:17.250
Further, he will not stop.

18:17.333 --> 18:19.167
Will not slow down,
will not give up

18:19.250 --> 18:20.542
until he has proved

18:20.625 --> 18:22.500
that the Centauri
are behind these attacks.

18:22.583 --> 18:23.917
He's the perfect candidate.

18:24.000 --> 18:26.667
Oh, you're just saying that
because he is your friend.

18:26.750 --> 18:28.000
You're right.

18:28.083 --> 18:30.167
He's my friend.
It's also true.

18:30.250 --> 18:33.667
And that is why you did not
assign him to that area.

18:33.750 --> 18:35.167
Isn't it?

18:39.333 --> 18:42.208
I called you in here
to confront you

18:42.292 --> 18:45.708
about using the rangers
to gather covert information

18:45.792 --> 18:47.667
without telling me.

18:47.750 --> 18:50.875
So why am I, all of a sudden,
having to defend myself?

18:50.958 --> 18:54.000
I did not tell you,
so you would have deniability

18:54.083 --> 18:57.000
in case things went badly.

18:57.083 --> 18:59.500
You're being defensive
because I'm right.

18:59.583 --> 19:02.375
You did not send him
because he's my friend.

19:07.750 --> 19:09.375
Delenn, listen, uh..

19:11.500 --> 19:13.708
...in the last year or so,
we have both

19:13.792 --> 19:16.583
lost people that we cared about.

19:16.667 --> 19:18.208
You in particular.

19:18.292 --> 19:22.000
I mean, Marcus, Neroon, others.

19:24.125 --> 19:26.583
I just wanted to protect you,
that's all.

19:26.667 --> 19:29.792
(man on radio)
'Mr. President, call for you
from White Star 27.'

19:32.458 --> 19:33.625
Uh, put it through.

19:33.708 --> 19:35.375
(man on radio)
'Stand by.'

19:35.458 --> 19:36.750
Yes, captain, what is it?

19:36.833 --> 19:39.208
Ranger trainee Lennier
is missing.

19:39.292 --> 19:40.917
'He apparently
took out a fighter'

19:41.000 --> 19:43.125
'shortly after
we jumped to hyperspace'

19:43.208 --> 19:47.583
turning off launch base
scanners to avoid detection.

19:47.667 --> 19:50.583
We doubled back to look for him
and found nothing.

19:50.667 --> 19:55.167
Frankly, Mr. President,
he could be anywhere.

19:55.250 --> 19:58.292
[dramatic music]

20:13.833 --> 20:17.083
(Lennier)
'Ship, continue recording
of personal journal.'

20:17.167 --> 20:20.125
I continue to track
the path of the tachyon signal

20:20.208 --> 20:23.375
that will, I hope,
lead to a hidden Centauri base.

20:24.875 --> 20:27.292
I've discovered that
the distance from that location

20:27.375 --> 20:29.333
to any rendezvous point

20:29.417 --> 20:31.167
is longer than
my supply of oxygen

20:31.250 --> 20:33.958
unless extreme measures
are taken.

20:34.042 --> 20:35.708
I am thus entering
a meditative state

20:35.792 --> 20:39.250
which will allow me
to conserve air and energy.

20:39.333 --> 20:41.708
I've programmed the ship
to continue on autopilot

20:41.792 --> 20:43.708
and monitor our situation.

20:43.792 --> 20:46.542
It will alert me if anything
attempts to intercept us.

20:48.875 --> 20:51.458
This will be
my last recording

20:51.542 --> 20:53.625
for a while.

20:53.708 --> 20:55.125
Recording off.

20:55.208 --> 20:56.708
[automated voice]
'Confirmed.'

20:57.875 --> 20:59.750
I only hope I'm right.

21:02.667 --> 21:05.542
[dramatic music]

21:10.875 --> 21:12.333
[doorbell beeping]

21:18.250 --> 21:19.333
Enter.

21:24.500 --> 21:25.500
Hello, G'Kar.

21:25.583 --> 21:27.833
Ah, Ms. Alexander.

21:27.917 --> 21:29.875
A pleasure to see you again.

21:29.958 --> 21:32.583
I've noticed you here and there
since you got back

21:32.667 --> 21:33.708
but in all this time

21:33.792 --> 21:35.167
I don't think
we've ever had a chance

21:35.250 --> 21:36.292
to sit and talk.

21:36.375 --> 21:39.792
Oh, it's been crazy.
And call me Lyta.

21:39.875 --> 21:41.542
Of course. Please, sit.

21:41.625 --> 21:43.917
Thank you.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.792
How long is it since
you and I sat like this?

21:46.875 --> 21:48.292
Five years?

21:48.375 --> 21:50.083
Summer, 2257.

21:50.167 --> 21:52.958
Right around the time
Ambassador Kosh came aboard.

21:53.042 --> 21:56.375
Six years, by G'Quan,
where does the time go?

21:57.833 --> 22:01.583
Uh, as I recall,
you made me a proposition.

22:01.667 --> 22:04.042
If I gave you access to my DNA

22:04.125 --> 22:06.583
to help your people
develop telepaths

22:06.667 --> 22:09.500
you would see to it
that I was..

22:09.583 --> 22:11.500
Oh, how did you put it?
Um..

22:11.583 --> 22:15.375
That I would be compensated,
quite handsomely.

22:15.458 --> 22:16.917
Yes, it was to be either

22:17.000 --> 22:20.125
a cloning of your
genetic material or a..

22:23.708 --> 22:25.167
A direct mating.

22:27.250 --> 22:28.708
Pity.

22:28.792 --> 22:32.250
We never did find out
what your pleasure threshold is.

22:35.375 --> 22:36.875
But that was long ago.

22:38.167 --> 22:41.083
What can I do for you now, Lyta?

22:41.167 --> 22:42.542
Um..

22:42.625 --> 22:45.250
Oh, well, I don't know
how long that offer was good for

22:45.333 --> 22:49.750
but...I just wanted
to tell you that I..

22:49.833 --> 22:52.458
...accept your proposition.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.292
Which part?

22:57.375 --> 22:59.458
The part where I give you access

22:59.542 --> 23:02.375
to my genetic material.

23:02.458 --> 23:03.792
Oh.

23:03.875 --> 23:06.250
(Lyta)
'Assuming
you're still interested.'

23:08.875 --> 23:12.375
We have been trying
to reacquire the telepathic gene

23:12.458 --> 23:15.250
ever since our own telepaths
were wiped out by the Shadows

23:15.333 --> 23:18.625
as a protection
against their return.

23:18.708 --> 23:20.708
The Shadows are gone now, but

23:20.792 --> 23:24.333
we remain one of the few races
without telepaths.

23:24.417 --> 23:27.667
Look, G'Kar,
I'll give it to you straight.

23:27.750 --> 23:30.917
In return
for certain considerations

23:31.000 --> 23:33.792
you'll get not only
my DNA sequence

23:33.875 --> 23:37.500
you'll get the DNA from
as many telepaths as you want

23:37.583 --> 23:38.833
until you find the sequence

23:38.917 --> 23:40.750
that combines well enough
with your DNA

23:40.833 --> 23:43.167
to let your people
start breeding telepaths.

23:43.250 --> 23:46.208
And what are these
considerations?

23:46.292 --> 23:48.458
Number one, money.

23:48.542 --> 23:50.167
A lot of it

23:50.250 --> 23:53.750
deposited into
a private account on Mars.

23:53.833 --> 23:57.958
Number two, at least
five deep-range starships.

23:58.042 --> 23:59.375
They don't have to be
top-of-the-line

23:59.458 --> 24:03.083
just enough to carry
a couple hundred people.

24:03.167 --> 24:04.708
Three

24:04.792 --> 24:07.958
we do this in absolute secrecy.

24:08.042 --> 24:09.917
There I may have a problem.

24:10.000 --> 24:12.000
As members
of Sheridan's new Alliance

24:12.083 --> 24:14.667
we have certain obligations.

24:14.750 --> 24:17.250
I've been told that each world's
internal affairs

24:17.333 --> 24:20.125
are considered private.

24:20.208 --> 24:23.417
This is about as internal
an affair as I can think of.

24:26.708 --> 24:29.208
Think it over, G'Kar.

24:29.292 --> 24:32.000
When you're ready to talk
you know where to find me.

24:33.625 --> 24:35.375
[door opens]

24:35.458 --> 24:38.292
Oh, and you mentioned wondering

24:38.375 --> 24:41.042
what my pleasure threshold is.

24:41.125 --> 24:44.042
I just recently found out..

24:44.125 --> 24:45.875
...I don't have one.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.625
Have a very, very nice day,
G'Kar.

24:52.083 --> 24:53.083
[door closes]

24:53.167 --> 24:54.958
[exhales]

24:56.125 --> 24:58.167
[indistinct chatter]

25:01.583 --> 25:04.125
(Garibaldi)
So, did I lie about the view?

25:04.208 --> 25:06.667
(Lise)
No, it's beautiful.

25:06.750 --> 25:08.708
(Garibaldi)
Just like you.

25:10.625 --> 25:12.208
Do you come here often?

25:12.292 --> 25:14.375
- Sir?
- Thank you.

25:14.458 --> 25:18.000
Uh, no, not in, uh,
three, four years.

25:18.083 --> 25:21.250
Last time when I was here it was
me, Ivanova, and Sinclair.

25:21.333 --> 25:22.667
We were celebrating
his engagement

25:22.750 --> 25:25.542
to a surveyor
named Catherine Sakai.

25:25.625 --> 25:27.292
That same night, though,
President Santiago

25:27.375 --> 25:28.500
was assassinated

25:28.583 --> 25:31.333
and I got shot in the back
and nearly killed.

25:31.417 --> 25:33.667
Next thing I know,
Sinclair was gone.

25:33.750 --> 25:36.708
Sakai, she disappeared
over a year ago.

25:36.792 --> 25:39.792
Now Ivanova's gone, and
Franklin's heading back to Earth

25:39.875 --> 25:41.083
at the end of the year.

25:41.167 --> 25:42.417
You know,
sometimes I feel like

25:42.500 --> 25:43.875
the last soldier
on the battlefield.

25:44.000 --> 25:45.042
I'm looking around,
and I'm wondering

25:45.125 --> 25:47.250
where the hell did everybody go?

25:47.333 --> 25:49.500
Well, for a little while,
at least.

25:50.833 --> 25:54.125
It'll be good
to have you back on Mars.

25:54.208 --> 25:56.042
Ever since I inherited
William's Corporation

25:56.125 --> 25:58.042
I've been trying
to get up to speed.

25:58.125 --> 26:01.292
But there are some things there
I just don't understand.

26:01.375 --> 26:03.292
And some of it worries me.

26:04.833 --> 26:06.958
How did Sheridan react
when you told him?

26:07.042 --> 26:09.042
You know, the last time
I was here they had this, uh

26:09.125 --> 26:10.708
Sirloin that was
made from soybeans fake.

26:10.792 --> 26:12.167
It's usually not very good.

26:12.250 --> 26:14.417
But if you get them
to cook it just right, it--

26:14.500 --> 26:16.000
- Michael?
- Yeah.

26:17.500 --> 26:19.292
Did you tell them yet?

26:19.375 --> 26:20.417
[sighs]

26:22.458 --> 26:26.333
No. Look, I was just waiting
for the right time.

26:26.417 --> 26:27.833
Just in time.

26:27.917 --> 26:31.333
Sir, and madam, would you care
for anything to drink?

26:31.417 --> 26:32.750
The house wine,
whatever you've got

26:32.833 --> 26:34.167
as long as it's red.

26:34.250 --> 26:37.000
Of course. Sir?

26:37.083 --> 26:39.167
Uh, I'll just have some coffee.

26:39.250 --> 26:40.875
I see. Coffee for after dinner.

26:40.958 --> 26:42.958
And would you like
anything to drink?

26:43.042 --> 26:44.708
Coffee.

26:44.792 --> 26:46.292
'No, I think
sir misunderstands me.'

26:46.375 --> 26:48.625
'Would you like anything
to drink?'

26:48.708 --> 26:51.333
Why don't you just get me
a damn cup of coffee?

26:54.083 --> 26:55.167
Michael.

26:55.250 --> 26:56.875
[sighs]

26:56.958 --> 26:58.500
Is it me?
Did I miss something?

26:58.583 --> 26:59.833
Did I misunderstand something?

26:59.917 --> 27:01.208
I mean, I could have sworn
you said that

27:01.292 --> 27:02.708
you were coming here
to help me relax

27:02.792 --> 27:05.667
to unwind, get rid of
some of the tension.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.708
Why do I feel like
blowing my brains out?

27:07.792 --> 27:09.417
You tell me.

27:09.500 --> 27:12.708
I...don't want to have

27:12.792 --> 27:16.125
this conversation anymore.

27:16.208 --> 27:19.167
Now why don't you and I just..

27:19.250 --> 27:21.875
...have a romantic,
quiet evening

27:21.958 --> 27:23.708
just the two of us?

27:23.792 --> 27:25.125
And then
we'll go back to my quarters

27:25.208 --> 27:27.208
and we'll make up
for all that time

27:27.292 --> 27:28.917
that we've been missing.

27:30.958 --> 27:32.875
What do you say?

27:33.958 --> 27:35.458
Okay.

27:35.542 --> 27:37.583
Okay.

27:37.667 --> 27:38.917
Good.

27:44.542 --> 27:46.083
What's wrong?

27:46.167 --> 27:49.250
That is the worst cup..

27:51.583 --> 27:53.167
I'll be right back.

27:53.250 --> 27:55.292
- Where are you going?
- This will just take a minute.

28:09.083 --> 28:12.042
I see we were talking about
the same thing after all.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.917
And from now on,
I will bring the, um

28:14.000 --> 28:16.833
special coffee,
if that is what sir wants.

28:20.333 --> 28:21.625
[beep]

28:21.708 --> 28:22.667
Yes?

28:22.750 --> 28:23.750
(man on radio)
'White Star 27'

28:23.833 --> 28:24.833
'on the line for you, sir.'

28:24.917 --> 28:25.875
Put him through.

28:25.958 --> 28:27.250
(man on radio)
'Stand by.'

28:29.250 --> 28:31.250
Montoya, what's the situation?

28:31.333 --> 28:33.875
White Stars 7, 12, and 14
have been assisting us

28:33.958 --> 28:35.958
in a full-scale search
for Lennier's fighter.

28:36.042 --> 28:37.542
We found nothing.

28:40.542 --> 28:41.625
Keep looking.

28:41.708 --> 28:43.000
There's something else.

28:43.083 --> 28:45.625
Minbari fighters are intended
for short-range combat

28:45.708 --> 28:48.625
strike and return.

28:48.708 --> 28:50.208
'They carry
an emergency air supply'

28:50.292 --> 28:52.458
'just in case they're
left behind during a battle.'

28:52.542 --> 28:53.583
Under normal conditions

28:53.667 --> 28:56.125
that can sustain a pilot
for 36 hours.

28:56.208 --> 28:57.333
It has now been

28:57.417 --> 29:00.208
almost 48 hours
since Lennier took off.

29:02.583 --> 29:05.917
'Now, it's possible
to extend that period'

29:06.000 --> 29:07.583
'by entering
a state of meditation'

29:07.667 --> 29:09.083
'to lower heartbeat
and respiration.'

29:09.167 --> 29:11.000
'That's part of their training.'

29:11.083 --> 29:13.833
'And Lennier
is very good at it.'

29:13.917 --> 29:14.917
'Even so'

29:15.000 --> 29:16.333
I wanted you to know

29:16.417 --> 29:18.833
because even
under optimum conditions

29:18.917 --> 29:21.667
if he has not
already run out of air

29:21.750 --> 29:23.625
he should be out anytime now.

'the tachyon stream.'

29:36.333 --> 29:37.792

29:43.375 --> 29:46.917

'Stealth mode confirmed.'

...ten degrees..

29:54.375 --> 29:56.125
...off beacon.

29:57.292 --> 29:58.542
Slow..

29:59.833 --> 30:01.708
...and allow the ship to pass.

30:01.792 --> 30:03.208

30:52.458 --> 30:55.333
[dramatic music]

31:12.125 --> 31:14.583
It was wrong of me
to be upset with you

31:14.667 --> 31:16.375
when all of this came out.

31:18.000 --> 31:21.083
You did what you thought was
right under the circumstances.

31:22.542 --> 31:24.917
An-and it was the right thing
to do, Delenn.

31:27.250 --> 31:28.625
I mean..

31:30.083 --> 31:33.125
...of all the other rangers

31:33.208 --> 31:35.208
he was the right choice.

31:35.292 --> 31:36.917
The logical choice.

31:39.375 --> 31:43.208
I mean,
you had no way of knowing.

31:45.875 --> 31:47.583
'It is not your fault.'

31:47.667 --> 31:49.583
He's not dead.

'...it's been over
three days now.'

31:57.375 --> 31:58.583
'His air would have run out--'

31:58.667 --> 32:01.708
He's not dead
until I see a body.

from the Homeworld.'

32:37.417 --> 32:39.333

Alright. In a minute.

[sighs]

32:46.958 --> 32:48.833
[coughing]

32:53.750 --> 32:55.167
Alright.

32:55.250 --> 32:56.250
What? What is it?

32:56.333 --> 32:58.542
Mollari,
our sources on the Drazi

32:58.625 --> 33:01.458
Homeworld and elsewhere
have led us to conclude

33:01.542 --> 33:03.875
that Sheridan's people
are attempting to blame us

33:03.958 --> 33:06.167
for the recent attacks
on alliance shipping lanes.

33:06.250 --> 33:07.208
What?

33:07.292 --> 33:08.208
'We believe'

33:08.292 --> 33:09.458
'they are even willing to'

33:09.542 --> 33:11.042
'fabricate evidence
to that effect.'

33:11.125 --> 33:13.333
No, I don't believe it.
I know Sheridan.

33:13.417 --> 33:14.750
He would never do that.

33:14.833 --> 33:17.542
But that cannot be
said for others.

33:17.625 --> 33:21.083
Remember, the Narns are also
members of the alliance

33:21.167 --> 33:22.667
and they have access
to many of the ships

33:22.750 --> 33:26.042
and weapons we left behind
on their Homeworld.

33:26.125 --> 33:29.417
More than enough to fool others
into believing we were involved.

33:29.500 --> 33:31.375
You're saying G'Kar?

33:31.458 --> 33:33.000
No.

33:33.083 --> 33:36.458
But many of his people
consider him too close to us

33:36.542 --> 33:39.667
and have not informed him
of their intentions.

33:39.750 --> 33:42.125
'You must do everything
you can to stop them'

33:42.208 --> 33:45.875
from blaming our people
for these attacks.

33:45.958 --> 33:48.875
If they attempt
to move against us..

33:50.000 --> 33:52.625
...we will fight back.

33:52.708 --> 33:55.667
'This could be
the first step towards war.'

34:01.125 --> 34:02.083
[doorbell beeping]

34:02.167 --> 34:03.417
(G'Kar)
Yes?

34:03.500 --> 34:04.875
[door opens]

34:07.708 --> 34:10.167
You wanted to see me, G'Kar?

34:10.250 --> 34:11.792
Yes.

34:11.875 --> 34:14.292
I have spoken
with my government.

34:14.375 --> 34:16.542
They will agree to your terms.

34:16.625 --> 34:18.375
We will give you
support and money

34:18.458 --> 34:20.208
even a couple of ships

34:20.292 --> 34:23.208
in exchange
for access to telepath DNA

34:23.292 --> 34:25.292
with one stipulation.

34:25.375 --> 34:27.500
They have asked me to ask you

34:27.583 --> 34:29.458
if you would be willing
to have your people

34:29.542 --> 34:32.125
listen in on the thoughts
of the other ambassadors

34:32.208 --> 34:34.292
from time to time

34:34.375 --> 34:36.833
and report in on what you find.

34:38.250 --> 34:40.333
That's the condition?

34:40.417 --> 34:42.167
That's the condition.

34:50.417 --> 34:52.833
Then I'm gonna have to decline.

34:55.583 --> 34:57.333
I've decided
there's a lot of things

34:57.417 --> 35:00.542
I can do that I didn't think
I could before.

35:00.625 --> 35:03.375
But this?

35:03.458 --> 35:06.542
There's still a little bit
of decency left in me, G'Kar.

35:08.250 --> 35:10.083
Even if it means
blowing the deal

35:10.167 --> 35:12.417
I can't do this.

35:12.500 --> 35:15.375
I'm sorry I wasted your time.

35:15.458 --> 35:17.500
(G'Kar)
'Lyta, wait.'

35:18.708 --> 35:21.750
There is no such condition.

35:21.833 --> 35:24.667
I wanted to see
how far you would go.

35:24.750 --> 35:27.167
'If you had said yes,
then there would be no deal'

35:27.250 --> 35:29.917
because I could not trust you.

35:30.000 --> 35:32.292
No was the right answer.

35:35.792 --> 35:38.208
Then we have a deal?

35:38.292 --> 35:40.375
We have a deal.

35:40.458 --> 35:42.917

but please'

36:34.417 --> 36:35.667
'Don't you understand?'

We've..'

36:46.500 --> 36:49.125
Ship, stand by to disengage.

36:49.208 --> 36:51.417
As soon as they're ready to jump

36:51.500 --> 36:54.292
move us
into the field of debris.

36:54.375 --> 36:55.583
With luck, they won't notice us

36:55.667 --> 36:58.208
with so much else
floating around.

37:07.542 --> 37:09.125

37:09.208 --> 37:11.042
Did we get all of that?

[automated voice]
'Confirmed. Full video
and audio records online.'

37:27.292 --> 37:29.167
Negative.

37:29.250 --> 37:30.708
I think..

37:32.042 --> 37:34.250
I think I will watch.

37:34.333 --> 37:36.292
And pray for a while.

37:42.125 --> 37:44.000
And we're en route
to Babylon 5 at top speed.

37:44.083 --> 37:47.458
We estimate our arrival at 0900
tomorrow morning, your time.

37:47.542 --> 37:50.750
'Should I notify
Ambassador Delenn?'

37:50.833 --> 37:52.750
No. I'll tell her myself.

37:52.833 --> 37:54.000
Thank you, captain.

37:54.083 --> 37:55.125
[beep]

38:03.667 --> 38:05.208
Tell me what?

38:06.417 --> 38:08.542
They found Lennier's fighter.

38:09.542 --> 38:11.333
He's alive, Delenn.

38:11.417 --> 38:13.708
He could barely stand up
by the time they got him out

38:13.792 --> 38:15.542
but he's alive.

38:16.958 --> 38:19.958
He found the proof
we were looking for.

38:20.042 --> 38:22.000
Of course.

38:22.083 --> 38:23.667
As I said, I..

38:25.125 --> 38:26.500
...I knew he would.

38:27.792 --> 38:29.167
Excuse me.

38:30.292 --> 38:33.333
[instrumental music]

38:41.708 --> 38:43.542
[laughs]

38:48.292 --> 38:50.042
Delenn?

38:50.125 --> 38:52.083
[laughs]

38:52.167 --> 38:53.625
Are you alright?

39:01.708 --> 39:04.792
[music continues]

39:13.708 --> 39:15.292
What?

39:15.375 --> 39:17.042
What is this for?

39:17.125 --> 39:18.917
I have never done that

39:19.000 --> 39:21.417
in all the time
you and I have been here.

39:23.292 --> 39:26.333
And, uh, I think very soon

39:26.417 --> 39:28.500
we will never have
another chance.

39:32.208 --> 39:35.292
[music continues]

39:44.458 --> 39:46.542
[indistinct chatter]

39:48.875 --> 39:50.500
Greetings, Entil'Zha Delenn.

39:50.583 --> 39:52.750
Oh, Lennier.

39:52.833 --> 39:54.333
[scoffs]

39:54.417 --> 39:56.167
I should, um..

39:56.250 --> 39:57.750
I should be very upset with you

39:57.833 --> 39:59.958
for disobeying a direct order.

40:00.042 --> 40:03.750
But, uh, I have decided
to overlook it for now.

40:06.042 --> 40:07.083
Mr. President.

40:07.167 --> 40:08.958
You did well, Lennier.

40:09.042 --> 40:10.250
Thank you.

40:10.333 --> 40:13.083
We live for the one.
We die for the one.

40:14.708 --> 40:16.667
Do you have the recordings?

40:24.292 --> 40:25.667
Thank you.

40:27.500 --> 40:30.833
Well, you should get some sleep.
You've had a hard few days.

40:30.917 --> 40:32.750
I will. Thank you.

40:34.458 --> 40:36.708
- Entil'Zha Delenn.
- Lennier.

40:41.417 --> 40:42.875
[indistinct chatter]

40:44.625 --> 40:47.500
You know, we have worked months
to get this information.

40:49.458 --> 40:51.208
[scoffs]

40:51.292 --> 40:52.250
And now that I have it

40:52.333 --> 40:53.292
a part of me wants to

40:53.375 --> 40:55.208
throw it through an airlock.

40:56.958 --> 40:59.042
I was hoping we were wrong,
Delenn.

41:00.625 --> 41:02.958
Damn it.
But I was hoping we were wrong.

41:04.375 --> 41:06.708
So was I.

41:06.792 --> 41:08.167
But now that we know the truth

41:08.250 --> 41:11.542
we have an obligation
to follow where it leads.

41:11.625 --> 41:14.542
I'll pass the word
to the rest of the ambassadors.

41:14.625 --> 41:16.792
Call for a closed session
first thing tomorrow

41:16.875 --> 41:18.500
to consider the evidence.

41:20.292 --> 41:22.542
Mr. President. Delenn.

41:22.625 --> 41:25.792
I, uh,
heard you were looking for me.

41:25.875 --> 41:30.000
Yes, I was. I want you to get
ahold of Stephen and G'Kar.

41:30.083 --> 41:32.542
Meet me in my quarters
in one hour.

41:32.625 --> 41:34.500
I have something
I wanna show you.

41:34.583 --> 41:37.042
And after that..

41:37.125 --> 41:38.500
...we're going to need you

41:38.583 --> 41:40.750
'like we've never
needed you before.'

41:42.625 --> 41:44.917
Now, this catalog
of various biologies

41:45.000 --> 41:47.917
will not be used for warfare,
I assume?

41:48.000 --> 41:49.917
Now, why does everyone ask that?
No, it will not..

41:50.000 --> 41:51.542
Londo, I need to speak
with you for a moment.

41:51.625 --> 41:53.750
In a minute, Vir.
I am speaking to the doctor.

41:53.833 --> 41:56.708
But this is very, um, important.

41:58.208 --> 41:59.958
I'm sorry, doctor.

42:02.417 --> 42:03.833
Well, Vir, what is it?

42:03.917 --> 42:06.417
Delenn and Sheridan have
called for a council meeting

42:06.500 --> 42:07.917
first thing tomorrow morning.

42:08.000 --> 42:09.667
And since they said there
would be no more meetings

42:09.750 --> 42:12.042
until they found out
who was behind these attacks

42:12.125 --> 42:13.333
they must have found something.

42:13.417 --> 42:15.583
Yes, well,
it does not necessarily mean

42:15.667 --> 42:17.167
they will implicate us.

42:17.250 --> 42:19.917
The minister's information
could be wrong.

42:20.000 --> 42:22.292
But I suppose
we'll find out tomorrow, hm?

42:22.375 --> 42:23.917
That's the point, Londo.

42:24.000 --> 42:27.208
Everyone's been invited
except you.

42:28.542 --> 42:30.583
[indistinct chatter]

42:36.250 --> 42:38.250
Oh, I don't like this.

42:38.333 --> 42:40.042
I don't like this at all.

42:40.958 --> 42:42.875
This is going to be bad.

42:44.750 --> 42:46.042
[indistinct chatter]

42:49.375 --> 42:51.750
[door opens]

42:51.833 --> 42:55.417
Michael, good. I was wondering
what was taking you so long.

42:55.500 --> 42:57.208
I was thinking I could make--

42:57.292 --> 42:59.792
- Leave.
- What?

42:59.875 --> 43:01.500
I want you to leave
just as quick as you can.

43:01.583 --> 43:04.333
Next transport out.
The sooner the better.

43:04.417 --> 43:06.250
No, I knew I shouldn't have
eaten at that restaurant.

43:06.333 --> 43:08.542
Every time I do,
something awful happens.

43:08.625 --> 43:11.292
What?
You're not making any sense.

43:11.375 --> 43:12.833
I want you to get out
of this part of space

43:12.917 --> 43:15.542
and back home
just as fast as you can.

43:15.625 --> 43:16.917
Because, barring an act of God

43:17.000 --> 43:18.458
and since
I don't believe in God

43:18.542 --> 43:20.708
that kind of narrows
the odds a bit

43:20.792 --> 43:22.750
by this time tomorrow

43:22.833 --> 43:25.083
we're going to be at war
with the Centauri.

43:32.208 --> 43:34.583
