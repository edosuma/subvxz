WEBVTT

00:02.440 --> 00:03.600
Argh!

00:04.520 --> 00:06.400
It's all about
feeling part of something.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.800
And I'm here to find out
what that's all about.

00:09.840 --> 00:10.800
Welcome.

00:10.920 --> 00:13.480
So, this room where I slept last
night, what exactly is local?

00:13.600 --> 00:15.520
You've got the blankets,
the art on the wall,

00:15.640 --> 00:17.480
and the bed that you slept on
last night.

00:17.560 --> 00:19.360
That's why you slept so well.

00:19.960 --> 00:21.120
Whoo!

00:22.040 --> 00:23.000
Whoo!

00:23.120 --> 00:25.640
Absolutely no idea
that we had wine in Wales.

00:26.400 --> 00:28.480
This is Welsh surf and turf,
this is, crab and sausages.

00:30.080 --> 00:31.000
- Morning, chaps.
- Morning.

00:31.120 --> 00:32.839
Pork belly from Brecon,
25 miles away.

00:32.919 --> 00:34.999
You've got a Michelin star...

00:35.079 --> 00:36.439
and you can't even afford plates?

00:37.439 --> 00:38.759
I never felt
so Welsh.

00:39.999 --> 00:40.719
Baa!

Let me go, you bastards!
Let me go!

03:41.398 --> 03:43.038
Let me go!

03:43.758 --> 03:44.798
OK, what have we got?

03:45.038 --> 03:46.518
She's not going
to tell Banfield.

03:46.598 --> 03:47.958
Anybody could have missed it.

03:48.078 --> 03:49.957
You wouldn't have.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.517
No, you shut up!

03:55.677 --> 03:58.157
I wasn't the one out
with that bitch all night!

04:02.717 --> 04:05.597
I have no idea how long I'm
going to be stuck in this place.

04:05.597 --> 04:08.117
You're going to have to
reschedule my entire day.

04:11.077 --> 04:13.477
Please?
Just a sec!

04:15.757 --> 04:16.837
I'll be with you
in a second!

04:16.997 --> 04:18.036
Please!
What?

04:18.156 --> 04:19.036
I found a baby.
I think it's dying.

04:19.156 --> 04:20.036
Banfield:
You found it?

04:20.237 --> 04:21.637
In front of
my apartment.
Outside?

04:21.757 --> 04:22.917
In the vestibule
by the mailboxes.

04:23.077 --> 04:24.117
It's inside,
but it's still cold.

04:24.277 --> 04:27.357
I need an infant warmer,
IV access and a rectal temp.

04:27.357 --> 04:28.277
Haleh:
I'll try an antecubital vein.

04:28.277 --> 04:29.477
CBC, chem panel and accucheck.

04:29.597 --> 04:31.917
And a blood culture, too.
How old do you think?

04:32.117 --> 04:33.477
Can't be more
than a couple of weeks.
Looks kind of dry.

04:33.637 --> 04:35.637
Umbilical stump is still on,
but it's clean.

04:35.797 --> 04:37.317
Somebody tied it
off with a string.

04:39.077 --> 04:40.757
Tenting. Dehydrated.

04:40.877 --> 04:42.517
He. You got a boy.

04:42.677 --> 04:43.637
Fontanelle's sunken.
How's that IV Coming?

04:43.757 --> 04:45.117
Got it.

04:45.237 --> 04:46.157
I'm drawing the bloods.

04:46.317 --> 04:47.637
Banfield:
Send the lytes critical.

04:47.797 --> 04:48.957
What fluids you want?

04:49.077 --> 04:49.997
Probably about six pounds.

04:50.117 --> 04:51.957
50cc saline bolus.

04:52.117 --> 04:54.957
Haleh:
Temp is 35.7.

04:54.957 --> 04:57.397
All right.
Was there a note, anything?

04:57.517 --> 04:58.917
Ma'am, was there...

04:58.917 --> 04:59.997
Where did she go?

05:00.117 --> 05:01.037
Who?

05:01.117 --> 05:02.117
The girl who brought him in.

05:02.237 --> 05:03.677
She was here a minute ago.

05:03.797 --> 05:05.717
(Alarms blaring)
He's seizing.

05:05.917 --> 05:08.437
All right.
0.25 milligrams Ativan.

05:23.077 --> 05:24.757
(Clanking, rattling)

05:35.356 --> 05:36.676
(Loud clank)

05:44.116 --> 05:46.396
(Coughing)

05:47.156 --> 05:48.676
Sleep OK?

05:48.676 --> 05:49.676
Um...

05:49.796 --> 05:52.356
K's down to 4.8.

05:53.996 --> 05:55.756
Take a deep breath.

05:56.636 --> 05:57.676
Another.

05:58.556 --> 05:59.636
Good.

05:59.636 --> 06:00.636
Lungs are clearing.

06:00.796 --> 06:02.036
Yeah, I'm actually
starting to feel...

06:02.156 --> 06:03.196
You were lucky.

06:03.356 --> 06:05.076
Skip dialysis
this week?
No.

06:05.276 --> 06:06.476
Staying away from the salt,
weighing yourself?

06:06.556 --> 06:08.076
Yes, of course.

06:08.196 --> 06:09.196
Your morning labs
come back OK,

06:09.356 --> 06:10.316
we can discharge you
this afternoon.

06:10.396 --> 06:11.316
Maggie will go over

06:11.516 --> 06:12.436
the dietary
restrictions with you.

06:12.596 --> 06:13.676
Make sure you stick
to the programme.

06:13.756 --> 06:15.276
I really don't...

06:15.436 --> 06:16.956
Pay attention to your fluid
intake, all right, Doctor?

06:20.236 --> 06:21.436
That was brisk.

06:21.876 --> 06:23.476
I really don't need

06:23.596 --> 06:25.876
to go over the dietary
restrictions again.

06:29.756 --> 06:31.756
No! Put that down!

06:33.356 --> 06:35.116
Who are you?

06:35.236 --> 06:36.676
You eat anything?
No.

06:36.836 --> 06:38.196
Liquids?
Not since last night.

06:38.196 --> 06:39.316
Who paged me back
down here again?

06:39.516 --> 06:40.836
That was me.
How are his lungs?
Claypool: Drying out.

06:40.996 --> 06:41.796
I was gonna order
a follow-up chest X-ray.

06:41.796 --> 06:42.916
Do it now. Sats?

06:43.076 --> 06:44.636
Ninety-two.
Somebody want
to tell me what's going on?

06:44.796 --> 06:46.676
Co-ags, clot in the
blood bank, electrolytes.
What's going on?

06:46.836 --> 06:48.196
I'm Dr Kurtag from
the transplant team.

06:48.316 --> 06:49.436
UNOS called.

06:49.636 --> 06:51.716
There's a chance they may
have found you a kidney.

07:00.156 --> 07:01.676
Hi.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.036
I'm Carol Hathaway.
Who's who?

07:04.196 --> 07:05.276
Chris Zafares,
OSHU Portland. Lungs.

07:05.396 --> 07:06.396
Jon Pares,

07:06.516 --> 07:08.115
St Luke's Boise.
Liver.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.315
Mila Ratkovich,

07:09.475 --> 07:11.635
Salt Lake City medical.
Pancreas.

07:11.795 --> 07:13.555
Neela Rasgotra, Chicago.
Heart.

07:13.675 --> 07:15.235
What's the hold-up?

07:15.395 --> 07:17.035
16-year-old kid riding his
bike home from the movies,

07:17.155 --> 07:18.115
drunk driver hit him.

07:18.235 --> 07:19.275
Grandma said yes
to organ donation

07:19.395 --> 07:20.435
and then changed her mind.

07:20.515 --> 07:21.755
Why?

07:21.875 --> 07:23.715
We took her in to say goodbye,
she squeezed his hand.

07:23.835 --> 07:25.115
She got a spinal cord reflex.

07:25.315 --> 07:27.035
Zafares:
The kid squeeze back?
Yeah.

07:27.115 --> 07:27.915
(All groan)

07:28.035 --> 07:29.115
So, what now?

07:29.235 --> 07:30.955
Well, I've ordered
a CBF study.

07:31.195 --> 07:31.955
Doug Ross,
attending physician.

07:32.075 --> 07:32.915
Hi.

07:33.035 --> 07:34.395
How long's that
gonna take?

07:34.515 --> 07:35.755
An hour, maybe two.

07:35.955 --> 07:37.075
Rasgotra: And the grandmother's
got consent?
Yeah.

07:37.195 --> 07:38.675
No mom or dad to ask?

07:38.835 --> 07:40.155
Dad's gone, the grandma's
trying to find the mother.

07:40.315 --> 07:41.555
I've been talking
to the grandmother.

07:41.675 --> 07:43.195
You give her some time, she's
gonna do the right thing.

07:43.395 --> 07:44.555
Hathaway:
So sit tight, have some coffee,

07:44.715 --> 07:45.995
watch some TV.
We'll get back to you

07:46.155 --> 07:47.955
as soon as we can.
(All groaning, murmuring)

07:50.075 --> 07:51.275
(sputtering)

07:51.275 --> 07:52.355
Still no mom?

07:52.475 --> 07:54.315
The number the grandmother
gave me is disconnected.

07:54.395 --> 07:55.755
Busy downstairs?

07:55.835 --> 07:57.315
Yeah, I gotta get back.

07:57.435 --> 07:58.915
Grandmother's alone,
she's frightened.

07:59.075 --> 08:00.195
She could use
some support.

08:00.355 --> 08:02.195
I asked her if I could
call anyone else for her,

08:02.355 --> 08:04.155
and she said, "No, just
please find my daughter."

08:04.355 --> 08:06.555
Well, let's hope we didn't
bring all these people
out here for nothing.

08:06.675 --> 08:07.595
Yeah.

08:07.715 --> 08:08.675
Mm.

08:16.315 --> 08:18.155
Hi.
I've got to go.

08:22.195 --> 08:23.155
Did you run the test?

08:23.275 --> 08:25.635
We'll get the results back soon,

08:25.635 --> 08:27.115
but I don't want you
to get your hopes up.

08:27.275 --> 08:29.275
I've heard of people
that have been in a coma

08:29.475 --> 08:31.635
for a very long time and
then they suddenly wake up.

08:31.795 --> 08:34.914
We don't think Billy
is in a coma.

08:35.034 --> 08:37.034
He squeezed my hand.
I know.

08:37.195 --> 08:39.315
But it was probably just
a spinal cord reflex.

08:39.475 --> 08:42.075
The test that
we ran earlier indicates

08:42.195 --> 08:44.835
there is no brainstem activity.

08:47.954 --> 08:49.234
He squeezed my hand.

08:51.834 --> 08:54.434
I'll come and find you when the
new test results come in, OK?

08:55.794 --> 08:58.194
There were five kids
riding their bikes home

08:58.354 --> 09:00.074
and the car only hit Billy.

09:05.154 --> 09:06.474
Can I get you something?
Some coffee?

09:06.554 --> 09:09.674
No. Thank you.

09:18.634 --> 09:20.274
Why is he seizing?
What do you think?

09:20.434 --> 09:22.074
Sepsis?
Maybe.

09:22.194 --> 09:23.954
Oh, um, electrolytes?
Glucose was 88.

09:24.154 --> 09:26.314
Add an ammonia level, serum
ketones, and lactate level.

09:26.434 --> 09:27.594
What are you thinking?

09:27.794 --> 09:29.514
Banfield:
Inborn errors of metabolism.
Pretty rare.

09:29.714 --> 09:30.594
Yeah, well, we don't know
if we don't look.

09:30.594 --> 09:31.554
Ativan's on board.

09:31.554 --> 09:33.354
OK, good.
We still need an etiology.

09:33.554 --> 09:36.714
Infection?
Is that a statement
or a question?

09:38.314 --> 09:39.674
Ceftriaxone, 150 milligrams.

09:39.794 --> 09:41.234
Set up
for a cath DUA and an LP.

09:41.354 --> 09:43.674
Labs are back.

09:43.834 --> 09:45.834
Bingo.
Sodium is 115.

09:45.954 --> 09:47.554
Daria, why so low?

09:47.674 --> 09:49.274
Uh, dehydration?

09:49.434 --> 09:51.194
Or maybe the mom was
watering down the formula.

09:51.394 --> 09:52.914
Watering it down?
Trying to make it
stretch further.

09:53.034 --> 09:55.554
I've seen it before.
Formula's expensive.

09:55.554 --> 09:56.874
Hypertonic saline.

09:57.034 --> 09:58.474
What about the risk of central
pontine myelinolysis?

09:58.594 --> 10:00.354
He seized.
We have to correct his sodium.

10:00.514 --> 10:01.554
Morris: Yeah, but if you fix
it too quickly,

10:01.714 --> 10:03.034
He could sustain
permanent brain damage.

10:03.034 --> 10:04.234
That's why we're not going
to do it too quickly.

10:04.394 --> 10:06.634
10cc bolus
of three percent saline.

10:29.113 --> 10:30.233
Hey.

10:30.313 --> 10:32.673
She's hanging in there.

10:35.073 --> 10:36.353
It's amazing, isn't it?

10:36.473 --> 10:38.713
No heart, but she's still alive.

10:41.313 --> 10:44.433
So they told you?

10:44.593 --> 10:46.233
That another heart
might be coming?

10:52.913 --> 10:55.513
They're not going
to screw it up again.

10:55.673 --> 10:58.153
Now that was a one
in a million thing.

11:04.393 --> 11:07.473
You know, having someone
that you really care about,

11:07.633 --> 11:09.993
who you really
love, who's sick...

11:10.153 --> 11:13.633
that's a lot like
running a marathon.

11:13.793 --> 11:18.153
You just got to take one step
at a time, one day at a time.

11:18.313 --> 11:20.313
But if you keep running
and having faith

11:20.513 --> 11:22.633
that it'll happen,
then one day, eventually,

11:22.753 --> 11:24.353
you'll finish the race.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.553
Marquez:
Repeat sodium is 122.

11:28.713 --> 11:31.633
Hemogram and the rest
of the lytes are normal.

11:31.633 --> 11:33.833
We're definitely headed
in the right direction.

11:33.993 --> 11:35.953
Keep normal saline going
at 10cc's per hour.

11:35.953 --> 11:37.393
Do you really think it was
just that, just the fluids?

11:37.513 --> 11:38.753
Looks likely.

11:38.753 --> 11:40.793
(Baby cries)

11:40.793 --> 11:42.873
Maybe he's hungry.

11:43.433 --> 11:44.313
No.

11:44.433 --> 11:45.673
No, no, no, no.
I-I-I-

11:45.833 --> 11:47.153
I try to keep the relationship

11:47.313 --> 11:49.033
with the babies
strictly professional.

11:49.193 --> 11:50.273
Daria?
Hmm?

11:50.353 --> 11:51.473
Me?!

11:51.593 --> 11:52.473
Hm.

11:52.593 --> 11:54.113
Oh, for God's sake...

11:54.113 --> 11:55.913
Get family services down here
and call the PICU.

11:56.073 --> 11:57.873
They're going to have to
watch him overnight,

11:58.033 --> 11:59.993
follow his electrolytes.

12:06.832 --> 12:08.392
Did the girl
ever show up again?

12:08.472 --> 12:09.552
What girl?

12:09.712 --> 12:10.872
The one who
brought him in.

12:11.032 --> 12:12.192
No, I haven't
seen her.

12:12.352 --> 12:13.272
The police
are gonna want

12:13.392 --> 12:15.512
to talk to her -
family services, too.

12:15.672 --> 12:16.672
I'll look
around outside.

12:16.792 --> 12:17.512
OK.

12:21.072 --> 12:22.592
Hey, I think
he likes you.

12:22.712 --> 12:24.392
It's just the grasp reflex.

12:24.392 --> 12:25.192
Sure it is.

12:29.992 --> 12:33.152
Cappuccino machine's broken,
so no lattes.

12:33.312 --> 12:34.672
No lattes
in Seattle?

12:34.912 --> 12:36.032
That some sort
of cruel joke?

12:36.152 --> 12:38.632
(Chuckles softly)

12:38.712 --> 12:40.552
(Sighs wearily)

12:42.632 --> 12:44.912
So, you're almost done with
your surgical residency, huh?

12:45.032 --> 12:45.952
Yep.

12:46.032 --> 12:47.632
You gonna stay at County?

12:47.792 --> 12:48.872
You guys are from
Chicago, right?

12:48.992 --> 12:49.832
Yeah.

12:49.992 --> 12:51.272
We have one kidney
heading to Tacoma,

12:51.432 --> 12:52.752
Another was supposed
to go to Spokane,

12:52.872 --> 12:54.112
but the guy got the flu.

12:54.112 --> 12:56.272
UNOS kicked out
a match in Chicago.

12:56.392 --> 12:57.312
Northwestern.

12:57.472 --> 12:58.352
Thought maybe
you wouldn't mind

12:58.472 --> 12:59.912
hauling an extra cooler
back on the plane

13:00.032 --> 13:00.872
with your heart.

13:00.992 --> 13:01.872
Did the grandmother
sign off?

13:01.992 --> 13:03.192
Not yet.
The CBF just came back.

13:03.312 --> 13:05.192
We're gonna go talk to her now.

13:05.192 --> 13:06.632
Now, the CBF allows us

13:06.792 --> 13:09.512
to measure the blood flow
in the brain by

13:09.592 --> 13:11.152
injecting radioactive isotopes

13:11.232 --> 13:13.432
into the bloodstream.

13:13.592 --> 13:14.992
Now, this is
a normal brain.

13:15.072 --> 13:16.272
That's the radioactivity.

13:16.352 --> 13:17.552
(Switch clicks)

13:17.672 --> 13:19.552
Now, this is a dead brain...

13:19.672 --> 13:22.112
which is,
essentially, silent.

13:22.312 --> 13:24.752
That's your
grandson's brain.

13:26.912 --> 13:29.232
There's no blood flow,

13:29.312 --> 13:30.792
no corneal or jaw reflex,

13:30.912 --> 13:33.792
no gag reflex.

13:33.952 --> 13:36.912
He failed the apnea test
and now, the CBF.

13:40.592 --> 13:43.032
Nora, Billy's gone.

13:48.111 --> 13:49.671
She needs to see him.

13:49.791 --> 13:51.071
I'm sorry?

13:51.191 --> 13:52.471
His mother needs
to see him.

13:52.591 --> 13:53.671
Uh...
Did-did you reach her?

13:53.831 --> 13:55.351
I tried the numbers
you gave me.

13:55.551 --> 13:58.031
Maybe there's another
number I could try.
I don't know.

13:58.191 --> 13:59.151
Does she live
in Seattle?

13:59.311 --> 14:00.991
I don't know what
she would want me to do.

14:01.111 --> 14:02.631
If there's an address, I could
send someone out

14:02.751 --> 14:03.671
to try and find her.

14:03.791 --> 14:05.911
His mother needs to be here.

15:29.750 --> 15:31.190
Flu viruses can spread

15:31.190 --> 15:34.350
if you don't catch your coughs
or sneezes hygienically,

15:34.350 --> 15:37.390
passing flu from person to person.

15:37.390 --> 15:40.590
Flu viruses can live on hard surfaces
for several hours,

15:40.590 --> 15:42.830
making flu easy to spread.

15:42.830 --> 15:45.110
To prevent the spread of flu
when you cough or sneeze

15:45.110 --> 15:46.750
catch it in a clean tissue,

15:46.750 --> 15:50.470
bin it, and kill it by washing
your hands as soon as you can.

15:50.470 --> 15:51.790
Call for
the latest.

16:19.630 --> 16:23.110
(tannoy) "From Platform 4
to Becky's boyfriend's flat."

16:29.670 --> 16:31.310
(ABC) # Whoah-oh-oh

16:31.310 --> 16:35.070
# When your world is full
of strange arrangements

16:35.070 --> 16:38.790
(mobile beeps)
# And gravity won't pull you through

16:40.110 --> 16:43.150
# You know you're missing out
on something

16:43.150 --> 16:45.950
# Well, that something depends on you

16:47.710 --> 16:49.830
# All I'm sayin'

16:49.830 --> 16:51.750
# It takes a lot to love you

16:51.750 --> 16:55.710
(crowd sings along with ABC)
# All I'm doin', you know it's true

16:55.710 --> 16:58.390
# All I need now... is one thing...

17:01.550 --> 17:03.950
# ..turns... grey sky to blue

17:03.950 --> 17:06.429
# That's the look, that's the look

17:06.429 --> 17:08.189
# The look of love

17:08.189 --> 17:10.189
# That's the look, that's the look

17:10.189 --> 17:13.749
# The look of love

17:13.749 --> 17:15.269
# Look of love!

17:19.709 --> 17:21.069
Don't you hate being misled?

17:21.148 --> 17:22.108
"Gigantaburger"?

17:22.229 --> 17:24.229
I was expecting something
at least the size of my head.

17:24.348 --> 17:26.628
"Get the body
you've always dreamed of." Really?

17:26.749 --> 17:28.309
How do you know
what kind of bodies I dream of?

17:28.388 --> 17:30.109
"The funniest film of the decade!"

17:30.229 --> 17:32.549
I doubt it's even the funniest film
about a goat this decade.

17:32.669 --> 17:34.349
- (mouths)
- "It's not you, it's me."

17:34.469 --> 17:36.469
And the guy
you're sleeping with at work.

17:36.589 --> 17:37.549
Just give it
to me straight,

17:37.669 --> 17:39.109
like
a pear cider

17:39.189 --> 17:41.069
that's made from 100% pears.

17:41.149 --> 17:42.109
The only fruit

17:42.229 --> 17:44.109
that goes into
a Magners Pear cider

17:44.189 --> 17:45.189
is pear.

17:48.629 --> 17:50.789
"Strong,
athletic build"?

18:38.349 --> 18:39.869
How you doing?

18:39.949 --> 18:42.069
Uh...hungry.

18:42.069 --> 18:43.029
Yeah, well, don't eat.

18:43.109 --> 18:44.429
Thirsty, too.

18:44.549 --> 18:46.988
We'll get you some ice chips
to suck on. Half a cup.

18:49.188 --> 18:50.228
Where are we?

18:50.428 --> 18:52.748
There's been
a delay.

18:52.908 --> 18:53.748
What kind of delay?

18:53.868 --> 18:54.708
No idea.

18:54.828 --> 18:55.908
Kidney's coming
from the west coast.

18:56.068 --> 18:57.068
But they say
it's gonna happen?

18:57.228 --> 18:58.308
They say
there's been a delay.

18:58.508 --> 18:59.868
Soon as your
kidney's in the air,

18:59.868 --> 19:00.908
we'll haul you
up to pre-op.

19:00.988 --> 19:02.788
So...may not happen?

19:02.988 --> 19:03.868
What, you were
doing something

19:03.948 --> 19:05.028
more important today?

19:05.028 --> 19:05.908
(Chuckles):
No, it's just...

19:06.108 --> 19:07.428
If it takes a little
longer, all the better

19:07.588 --> 19:08.388
to finish drying
out your lungs.

19:08.588 --> 19:09.588
We've got two
days on a kidney

19:09.708 --> 19:10.788
once it's out of the donor.

19:10.908 --> 19:12.708
After I see your next set
of labs, I may want

19:12.908 --> 19:14.668
to hold off
a day anyway.
OK.

19:16.388 --> 19:18.268
Hathaway:
We can't browbeat her
into donating.

19:18.388 --> 19:20.108
She didn't give you
any more info on Mom?

19:20.228 --> 19:21.148
No.

19:21.268 --> 19:22.348
Who's in there with her?

19:22.468 --> 19:24.348
Neighbour.

19:26.348 --> 19:27.588
You OK?

19:27.788 --> 19:28.828
(Laughs gently)
I'm just tired.

19:28.908 --> 19:29.908
Why don't you go home?

19:30.068 --> 19:31.228
You've been on
since last night.

19:31.348 --> 19:32.228
I can finish this.

19:32.388 --> 19:33.548
No, I'm gonna
stick around.

19:33.668 --> 19:35.508
How were the girls
this morning?

19:35.628 --> 19:37.228
Complaining.

19:37.388 --> 19:38.548
Thursday.
Spelling test.

19:38.668 --> 19:40.988
You know, I'm a
very good speller.

19:42.748 --> 19:43.708
Yeah.
(Laughs)

19:43.868 --> 19:45.188
Why don't you grab
yourself some coffee?

19:45.308 --> 19:46.228
Stay awake.

19:46.308 --> 19:47.508
OK.

19:47.668 --> 19:49.068
I'm gonna try and
intercept the neighbour.
Oh.

19:49.268 --> 19:51.788
Find out more about
the family situation.
OK.

19:56.268 --> 19:57.908
So you guys are from
Chicago, huh?

19:57.908 --> 19:59.228
Yep.

19:59.388 --> 20:00.468
Where?
I used to work there.

20:00.548 --> 20:01.628
County.

20:01.708 --> 20:03.588
No kidding.

20:04.748 --> 20:06.468
I did my residency there.

20:06.588 --> 20:07.828
Really?
What?

20:07.948 --> 20:08.828
You a surgeon?

20:08.948 --> 20:10.348
No, paediatrics.

20:10.468 --> 20:11.948
Emergency paediatrics.

20:12.148 --> 20:13.908
Is Kerry Weaver
still kicking around?

20:14.068 --> 20:16.588
No, she, uh, left
a couple of years ago.

20:16.588 --> 20:18.308
Mm-hmm.
Peter Benton?

20:18.468 --> 20:20.548
Susan Lewis?

20:20.668 --> 20:22.788
Was, um, Abby Lockhart around
when you were there?

20:22.868 --> 20:24.228
No.

20:24.348 --> 20:25.027
How about Gregg Pratt?

20:25.147 --> 20:26.387
No.

20:26.387 --> 20:27.827
(gentle laugh)

20:29.947 --> 20:31.027
You're in surgery, right?

20:31.107 --> 20:32.627
Yeah.

20:32.747 --> 20:33.507
How about Anspaugh?

20:33.587 --> 20:35.347
Yep, he's still there.

20:35.547 --> 20:37.187
Yeah?
Rasgotra:
Yeah.

20:37.307 --> 20:39.107
(all laugh quietly)

20:39.987 --> 20:42.107
Well...

20:42.267 --> 20:44.587
you say hello to him for me.
Tell him Doug Ross said hi.

20:44.587 --> 20:45.827
Ragotra:
Sure. Bye.

20:45.827 --> 20:46.827
I didn't even hear the murmur.

20:46.987 --> 20:48.947
Well, they can be transient,
tough to pick up.

20:48.947 --> 20:50.787
An IV drug user
with a fever?

20:50.907 --> 20:52.107
I should've been
thinking endocarditis

20:52.267 --> 20:53.547
as soon as I
saw the chart.

20:53.667 --> 20:55.067
We've all missed
one of those.

20:55.267 --> 20:56.107
That's what
Laverne said.

20:56.267 --> 20:57.187
Laverne is a wise woman.

20:57.267 --> 20:59.307
You should listen to her.

20:59.507 --> 21:01.427
Look, just don't say
anything to Banfield, OK?

21:01.587 --> 21:04.027
I already questioned her
clinical judgment once today.

21:04.147 --> 21:05.707
Evaluations are
coming out this week.

21:05.827 --> 21:07.867
84-year-old woman, bedridden
with multiple sclerosis,

21:08.027 --> 21:09.547
Presents with fever
and vomiting for two days.

21:09.627 --> 21:11.587
BP 102/64, heart rate's 120.

21:11.867 --> 21:13.547
I tried to get a line in,
but I couldn't.

21:13.707 --> 21:16.427
Uh, she really can't hold
her head up very much anymore.

21:16.547 --> 21:17.467
OK.

21:18.787 --> 21:19.867
Hey, Frank, what
do you got open?

21:19.987 --> 21:20.827
Uh, curtain two.

21:20.907 --> 21:21.827
OK.

21:21.947 --> 21:23.467
Can she hear me,
understand me?

21:23.587 --> 21:24.587
Oh, yes, she understands.

21:24.667 --> 21:26.507
But she doesn't speak very much.

21:26.627 --> 21:28.347
But, uh, she's sharp
as a tack, doc.

21:28.507 --> 21:30.267
OK.
I'm Dr Gates.

21:30.427 --> 21:32.307
Uh, you've
been vomiting?

21:32.387 --> 21:33.507
Her name's Marjorie.

21:33.667 --> 21:34.787
OK, ready?
On three, guys.

21:34.867 --> 21:36.987
One, two, three.

21:37.147 --> 21:39.667
So, Marjorie, you've been
vomiting for a few days?

21:39.867 --> 21:40.627
(weakly):
Uh-huh.

21:40.747 --> 21:42.227
What medications is she taking?

21:42.307 --> 21:44.707
Oh, I got a list here.

21:44.707 --> 21:46.187
Oh, here. Baclofen

21:46.307 --> 21:48.787
for muscle spasm,
Clonazepam for tremors,

21:48.907 --> 21:52.467
Ditropan for bladder and
Zoloft for depression.

21:52.587 --> 21:53.747
OK.

21:53.827 --> 21:54.827
Here, sweetheart.

21:55.027 --> 21:56.907
Can you open
your mouth?

21:56.987 --> 21:57.867
Good.

21:58.027 --> 21:59.347
All right, now
take a deep breath,

21:59.467 --> 22:00.347
will you please?

22:00.467 --> 22:01.747
(weak, raspy breathing)

22:01.747 --> 22:02.787
Good, Marjorie.

22:02.787 --> 22:03.827
Very good.

22:03.907 --> 22:04.986
OK.

22:05.106 --> 22:06.666
Let's do ten
of IV Reglan,

22:06.906 --> 22:10.026
a gram of rectal Tylenol,
CBC, chem panel, UA...

22:10.186 --> 22:11.386
And what am I
leaving out, Daria?

22:11.546 --> 22:14.106
Oh, um...chest X-ray.

22:14.106 --> 22:15.026
Portable chest, right.

22:20.306 --> 22:22.826
Yeah. I thought you were NPO.

22:24.146 --> 22:25.426
(coughs)

22:25.426 --> 22:26.746
What the hell are you doing?

22:26.746 --> 22:27.666
(laughs)

22:27.786 --> 22:28.706
I'm working.

22:28.866 --> 22:29.706
What are you doing?

22:29.826 --> 22:32.546
I'm waiting.

22:32.666 --> 22:34.666
Nice socks.

22:34.786 --> 22:37.906
My feet got cold.

22:38.026 --> 22:39.426
You look ridiculous, Carter.

22:39.546 --> 22:40.746
(both laugh)

22:42.266 --> 22:44.466
I didn't know you
were on staff here.

22:44.586 --> 22:46.586
Yeah.

22:46.666 --> 22:47.946
Renal failure?

22:48.066 --> 22:49.866
It's a long story.
Are you on my transplant team?

22:50.026 --> 22:51.866
No, I'm, uh,
I'm general surgery.

22:51.986 --> 22:53.826
I just, I saw
a "J Carter" on the board,

22:53.946 --> 22:54.786
figured I'd check it out.

22:54.906 --> 22:55.786
Uh-huh.

22:55.866 --> 22:56.986
Kurtag, right?

22:57.106 --> 22:59.906
Yeah, I just met him today.

23:00.026 --> 23:00.866
Is he any good?

23:00.946 --> 23:02.786
Oh, he's terrific.

23:02.906 --> 23:04.586
He trained with Tullius
at the Brigham.

23:04.746 --> 23:06.066
Uh, bit of a prick though.

23:06.186 --> 23:07.946
Yeah, I kind of
picked up on that already.

23:08.106 --> 23:09.626
So I thought you were
still in Africa.

23:09.786 --> 23:12.666
I thought you were still
in private practice

23:12.786 --> 23:13.906
out in suburbia-ville.

23:14.066 --> 23:15.746
(chuckles)

23:15.906 --> 23:17.386
Yeah, well,
Reese is 13 now.

23:17.506 --> 23:18.466
He's 13?

23:18.626 --> 23:19.826
Oh, my God.

23:19.986 --> 23:22.506
How does
that happen?

23:22.626 --> 23:24.266
What about you?
You got kids?

23:24.426 --> 23:25.826
No.

23:25.946 --> 23:26.986
You're married though, right?

23:27.106 --> 23:28.586
In theory.

23:29.346 --> 23:30.626
Sorry.

23:30.626 --> 23:31.666
Don't be.

23:31.786 --> 23:33.426
It's just another long story.

23:36.546 --> 23:37.586
(chuckles softly)

23:37.706 --> 23:39.706
I, uh, I guess
I should get back.

23:39.866 --> 23:41.026
Yeah? OK.
Yeah.

23:43.465 --> 23:44.665
It's really good to see you.

23:44.745 --> 23:46.585
Yeah.

23:48.585 --> 23:50.585
Hey, did they tell you
what time you're going up?
No.

23:50.745 --> 23:52.305
No, we're in a bit
of a holding pattern,

23:52.465 --> 23:53.665
waiting for the
kidney to arrive.

23:53.665 --> 23:54.705
All right.

23:54.705 --> 23:56.385
I've got a hernia.

23:56.585 --> 23:57.905
I'll check back in
on you though.

23:58.025 --> 23:58.985
That would be great.

24:05.025 --> 24:06.545
(laughs gently)

24:08.305 --> 24:09.665
What's up?

24:09.865 --> 24:11.905
Transpo team from Salt Lake
is losing their patient.

24:12.065 --> 24:13.585
I spoke to the neighbour.

24:13.745 --> 24:15.785
Billy's mom split
six, seven years ago.

24:15.905 --> 24:17.345
Meth.

24:17.585 --> 24:20.105
Neighbour does not think
grandma's seen her since.

24:20.225 --> 24:21.625
Talk to Nora about it?

24:21.745 --> 24:23.745
No. She wants
to talk to you.

24:23.865 --> 24:25.305
(sighs heavily)

24:25.425 --> 24:26.865
OK.

24:30.905 --> 24:32.785
Hi.
I'm Doug Ross.

24:32.865 --> 24:34.625
I'm Susan Knefsey.

24:34.785 --> 24:36.585
I'm gonna go find
a cup of coffee.

24:36.665 --> 24:37.665
You want anything?

24:37.785 --> 24:39.065
OK.
Nice to meet you.

24:39.225 --> 24:40.505
It was nice
to meet you.

24:43.665 --> 24:45.105
(sighs)

24:50.265 --> 24:52.625
Uh, your daughter...
what's her name?

24:52.745 --> 24:54.185
Billy's mother.

24:54.265 --> 24:55.145
(sighs)

24:55.265 --> 24:56.425
Melissa.

24:56.585 --> 24:57.945
(Quietly)
Yeah.

25:00.545 --> 25:02.105
You have
other children?

25:05.105 --> 25:06.785
When was the last time
you saw her?

25:18.705 --> 25:20.705
What was Billy like?

25:25.264 --> 25:26.784
He's wonderful.

25:26.864 --> 25:28.984
Smart...

25:29.104 --> 25:32.144
funny, handsome...

25:34.704 --> 25:36.344
He loves music.

25:36.344 --> 25:38.904
Especially the kind
that I can't stand,

25:38.984 --> 25:40.304
and he plays it really loud.

25:40.424 --> 25:42.064
Yeah.

25:42.184 --> 25:44.464
Uh...

25:44.584 --> 25:47.144
Lots of friends.

25:47.144 --> 25:49.944
There's always kids
coming in and out of the house.

25:54.944 --> 25:56.664
Big heart.

25:58.384 --> 26:00.304
He really cares
about people.

26:00.304 --> 26:01.424
Even the little kids.

26:01.584 --> 26:03.184
I mean, it's really unusual,
you know?

26:05.544 --> 26:06.824
Sounds like
a great kid.

26:06.944 --> 26:09.584
Yeah.

26:10.744 --> 26:12.144
Generous?

26:23.304 --> 26:24.704
Yeah.

26:27.984 --> 26:29.184
Yes.

26:39.304 --> 26:42.664
What parts do they...use?

26:42.784 --> 26:46.144
Well, uh, Carol, you...?

26:52.584 --> 26:55.104
Pancreas, kidneys, liver,

26:55.184 --> 26:57.024
lungs...

26:57.144 --> 26:59.144
corneas to help
the blind see again.

26:59.264 --> 27:01.503
Bones, tendons, cartilage,

27:01.503 --> 27:03.943
ligaments to help
people walk.

27:06.543 --> 27:09.223
He can change lives
for the better.

27:10.023 --> 27:12.583
Five lives, maybe ten.

27:12.703 --> 27:14.383
Maybe dozens.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.823
Billy's heart could possibly

27:15.983 --> 27:18.623
save someone else's life
before dark.

27:18.823 --> 27:21.623
It's not gonna make up
for what you lost, but...

27:21.743 --> 27:24.463
it is something.

27:24.463 --> 27:25.663
(sighs)

27:29.063 --> 27:32.023
(sobs, sniffles)

27:56.943 --> 28:00.263
Guys, you want to hold up
here, just for a second?

28:03.703 --> 28:05.183
Can I...?

28:05.263 --> 28:06.583
Yes.

28:38.663 --> 28:40.942
Mr Manning?

28:41.062 --> 28:42.782
Oh. Call me Paul, please.

28:42.942 --> 28:44.902
OK, Paul, the
results are back,

28:45.062 --> 28:48.142
and, um, your wife has a
urinary tract infection

28:48.302 --> 28:49.942
that's spread
to her kidneys.

28:50.102 --> 28:53.582
We need to admit her to the
hospital for IV Antibiotics.

28:53.742 --> 28:56.022
Oh, well, can't it
be done at home?

28:56.182 --> 28:57.382
Home treatment is not
as effective.

28:57.382 --> 28:58.742
But she'd prefer it at home.

28:58.902 --> 29:00.862
I understand, but, you know,
a kidney infection can be

29:01.022 --> 29:02.142
life-threatening in a woman
of your wife's age.

29:02.342 --> 29:04.662
Um, I think she's trying
to get our attention.

29:04.782 --> 29:05.782
Oh, uh...

29:05.942 --> 29:07.222
She's thirsty.
All right.

29:07.342 --> 29:09.022
Daria, can you get
some water, please?

29:09.182 --> 29:10.742
No, no, no water.
Water'll choke her.

29:10.902 --> 29:14.902
Here, I got something here
that I know will work better.

29:14.982 --> 29:16.702
A little peach juice.

29:16.862 --> 29:19.782
Here, we're gonna have some
peach juice, darling, OK?

29:19.782 --> 29:21.262
Here we go.

29:21.262 --> 29:23.182
Here we go, darling.

29:23.302 --> 29:24.342
There you go.

29:24.582 --> 29:26.702
Easy, easy, easy.

29:26.702 --> 29:30.502
She just doesn't want to be
in another hospital.

29:30.502 --> 29:32.622
OK. We'll see
what we can do.

29:32.782 --> 29:33.982
We'll be back.

29:35.382 --> 29:38.102
Easy, girl, easy.

29:38.102 --> 29:40.542
You're really gonna
let him take her home?
That's what she wants.

29:40.662 --> 29:41.782
She has a treatable
infection.

29:41.942 --> 29:43.502
She's 84, she's frail,
she's disabled...

29:43.662 --> 29:44.942
Maybe this infection
is a blessing.

29:45.142 --> 29:47.222
You're gonna send
her home to die from
a treatable infection?

29:47.342 --> 29:48.822
500 Levaquin
for Mrs Manning in curtain two.

29:49.022 --> 29:50.702
You got it.
Look, they know
what they're asking.

29:50.822 --> 29:52.422
If she wants
to die at home,

29:52.582 --> 29:54.462
who are we to say
she shouldn't?

30:00.662 --> 30:02.622
Hey, hold the elevator, please.

30:08.222 --> 30:10.422
How's the child doing?
Stabilised, but we're
gonna have to keep him

30:10.582 --> 30:12.982
for a couple of days,
make sure he's OK.

30:13.142 --> 30:15.462
Woman who dropped him off give
you an address, anything?

30:15.622 --> 30:17.662
No, mm-mm. She told
one of the desk clerks

30:17.822 --> 30:19.742
she was late for work
and then left.

30:19.902 --> 30:22.021
We'll begin a search for
the parents or family.

30:22.181 --> 30:24.021
I contacted the police,
and they don't have

30:24.101 --> 30:25.381
any reports of missing babies.

30:25.541 --> 30:28.541
If no-one shows up before,
uh, you discharge him,

30:28.661 --> 30:31.221
then they'll take him
to the ERC and...

30:31.341 --> 30:33.861
get foster proceedings started.

30:33.981 --> 30:34.901
He's a cutie.

30:34.901 --> 30:36.421
Mm, yeah.

30:36.421 --> 30:39.101
I'm gonna need to appoint
someone from the hospital staff

30:39.261 --> 30:42.341
to be his protective
custodian while he's in here.

30:42.501 --> 30:44.501
You up for it?

30:44.621 --> 30:46.181
Uh...

30:46.301 --> 30:47.821
Sure.

30:47.821 --> 30:50.421
Good. I'll get
the paperwork.

31:04.781 --> 31:06.181
Where's our plane?

31:06.301 --> 31:07.621
What happened
to our plane,

31:07.781 --> 31:09.541
the plane that came
in from Chicago?

31:09.661 --> 31:11.541
The G-5?
They had to leave.

31:11.621 --> 31:12.861
They...what?!

31:13.021 --> 31:14.741
How much time do we have?
Eight hours.

31:14.861 --> 31:18.301
Eight hours until this heart
needs to be beating in a chest,

31:18.301 --> 31:22.381
or we might as well chop it up
and use it in shepherd's pie.

31:22.501 --> 31:24.341
Hi. Uh, we need a plane.

31:24.461 --> 31:25.501
Excuse me?

31:25.661 --> 31:27.421
I-I need a plane,
now, to Chicago.

31:27.541 --> 31:29.461
Do you have an aircraft
reserved with us?

31:29.581 --> 31:31.461
No. Our plane left,
and we need another.

31:31.621 --> 31:32.861
Something about
their service hours.

31:32.981 --> 31:34.941
Oh. Well, I don't have
anything available right now.

31:35.061 --> 31:36.141
I could make
a few calls,

31:36.301 --> 31:38.341
see if I can get a
flight crew to come in.

31:38.541 --> 31:40.101
How long will that take?
I could get
a crew here

31:40.101 --> 31:42.661
In three hours,
maybe four.
No, we don't have four hours.

31:42.661 --> 31:44.981
You see this?
There's a heart in
here, a human heart.

31:45.141 --> 31:46.261
In there?
Yeah, and there's

31:46.261 --> 31:48.461
a woman in Chicago dying
who needs this heart.

31:52.301 --> 31:54.581
I don't know if they'll do it.

31:54.741 --> 31:56.901
They're supposed
to be going to Cleveland.

31:56.901 --> 31:58.501
You like reggae music?

31:58.581 --> 32:00.420
What?

32:15.540 --> 32:17.020
Carter.

32:18.220 --> 32:19.700
Carter!

32:22.540 --> 32:23.700
Hey.

32:23.700 --> 32:25.340
You OK?
Yeah.

32:25.340 --> 32:29.620
Well, they gave me Kyexelate
to lower my potassium.

32:29.620 --> 32:30.660
Oh.

32:30.780 --> 32:32.660
Oh, that is just cruel.

32:32.780 --> 32:33.900
What?

32:34.020 --> 32:35.940
I'm dying of thirst.
I'm starving, too.

32:36.100 --> 32:39.060
What else you got, a burger
hidden in your scrubs there?

32:39.180 --> 32:41.820
No, just...
an energy bar.

32:41.980 --> 32:43.980
Mmm.
That's just wrong.

32:44.100 --> 32:45.460
Mmm.

32:45.540 --> 32:47.060
Peanut butter.

32:47.220 --> 32:49.980
(chuckles)
Oh, God.

32:50.100 --> 32:51.820
Mm, mm, mm.

32:51.820 --> 32:53.660
So, where is everybody?

32:53.660 --> 32:54.740
Who?

32:54.900 --> 32:56.860
Your people,
your family.

32:57.020 --> 32:59.780
My folks, uh, are
in the Bahamas for winter.

32:59.980 --> 33:01.740
They know what's
going on?

33:03.300 --> 33:06.140
They couldn't make it back,
even if they wanted to.

33:06.300 --> 33:07.420
Come on, man,
fire up the jet,

33:07.620 --> 33:09.580
They could be back here
before you leave post-op.

33:09.700 --> 33:10.900
No more jet.

33:11.060 --> 33:12.780
Really?
The recession, man.

33:12.900 --> 33:13.860
Haven't you heard?

33:14.020 --> 33:15.580
(scoffs)
Tell me about it.

33:15.700 --> 33:17.700
My mortgage was
just reset.

33:17.780 --> 33:19.260
(sighs)

33:19.260 --> 33:20.420
So, uh...

33:20.420 --> 33:22.460
How long were
you in Africa?

33:22.460 --> 33:23.500
Four years.

33:23.620 --> 33:25.460
Yeah? Is that where
you met your ex?

33:25.580 --> 33:27.420
Mm-hmm. Kem.

33:27.540 --> 33:29.420
She's not my ex yet.

33:29.540 --> 33:33.220
Would you like to see
a picture of her?

33:33.220 --> 33:34.460
Sure.

33:39.339 --> 33:41.099
(chuckles)

33:45.019 --> 33:46.099
OK?

33:46.219 --> 33:48.139
(laughs)

33:50.499 --> 33:52.379
You married a sister?

33:52.539 --> 33:55.059
(both laugh)

33:55.059 --> 33:56.259
She's half Congolese.

33:56.339 --> 33:57.979
She was raised in France.

33:58.099 --> 33:59.699
Wow.

33:59.779 --> 34:01.259
Hey, she's gorgeous, man.

34:01.339 --> 34:02.899
You gonna let this get away?

34:05.459 --> 34:07.499
Not my choice, really.

34:07.619 --> 34:08.819
She know what's going on?

34:09.018 --> 34:11.219
That you're here waiting
for a transplant?
Mm-mm.

34:11.379 --> 34:13.739
(sighs)
She's in Paris.

34:13.739 --> 34:15.179
(clears throat)

34:15.339 --> 34:16.899
Her mom's sick.
It's a whole...

34:16.899 --> 34:18.059
< Dr Carter!

34:18.059 --> 34:20.418
Excuse me.
Is everything OK?

34:20.418 --> 34:23.418
We are moving you.

34:23.539 --> 34:25.819
Where's Kurtag?

34:25.899 --> 34:28.458
Could you grab that bag?

34:28.579 --> 34:29.899
Heads up.

34:30.498 --> 34:32.018
Let's go.

34:32.938 --> 34:34.259
Wish me
luck, huh?

34:34.418 --> 34:35.699
Yeah.

34:35.819 --> 34:37.379
(sighs)

34:48.779 --> 34:50.139
Mom?

34:54.299 --> 34:56.259
They found a heart?

34:56.379 --> 34:58.019
(exhales)

34:58.019 --> 34:59.299
< You should call her.

34:59.419 --> 35:00.379
Who?

35:00.499 --> 35:01.459
Your wife.

35:01.579 --> 35:04.179
She'd want to know.
Maybe come.

35:04.339 --> 35:06.059
(clears throat)
Now, uh...

35:06.179 --> 35:07.539
I don't know.

35:07.539 --> 35:09.859
Being on your deathbed, and all,

35:10.019 --> 35:12.259
she could swoop in,
be by your side.

35:12.419 --> 35:13.939
Very romantic.
Deathbed.

35:14.059 --> 35:15.499
I know your surgeon.

35:19.778 --> 35:21.498
You know what, uh,

35:21.658 --> 35:24.138
Reese is going to a bulls game
with a friend's family.

35:24.138 --> 35:25.538
I'll stick around
for a little bit,

35:25.538 --> 35:27.138
make sure Kurtag gets
all the sponges out.

35:28.578 --> 35:32.098
You don't have to do that.
Eh, I'll just
be at home

35:32.098 --> 35:34.658
on the sofa watching
Sportscenter anyway.

35:44.778 --> 35:46.938
They take her in
already?

35:47.058 --> 35:48.538
Yeah.

35:50.298 --> 35:53.498
You mind if I stick around?

35:53.618 --> 35:55.578
That would be nice.

36:00.738 --> 36:02.578
Was that it?

36:02.578 --> 36:04.538
Mm-hmm.

36:06.818 --> 36:08.578
(both laugh softly)

36:11.738 --> 36:13.658
Somebody order a kidney?

36:13.818 --> 36:16.658
Hey, we'd just about
given up on you. Get lost?

36:16.818 --> 36:18.938
Stopped, got my nails
done in Boise.

36:19.098 --> 36:20.818
Figured, "What's the hurry?"

36:20.938 --> 36:22.338
Flight was good?

36:22.338 --> 36:24.138
You like reggae?
What?

36:24.298 --> 36:26.058
Take care, huh?

37:53.417 --> 37:56.177
Does anybody know
when he's coming?

37:57.577 --> 37:59.297
How about a rough estimate?

37:59.457 --> 38:01.737
More than a minute,
less than a hockey season.

38:01.817 --> 38:02.937
More than an hour,

38:03.137 --> 38:05.017
less than the life-span
of a giant redwood tree?

38:05.017 --> 38:06.177
Carter.

38:06.177 --> 38:08.897
Sorry. I'm hungry,
thirsty, I'm tired,

38:08.897 --> 38:11.457
I'm cold, my arm
just fell asleep.

38:11.457 --> 38:12.977
Stop being a baby.
Plus, I feel like

38:13.137 --> 38:14.817
I'm hanging out of this thing.
Could someone cover up

38:14.977 --> 38:16.577
my crotch, please?
He's here.

38:19.617 --> 38:21.297
We have a visitor.

38:21.497 --> 38:24.977
I don't remember being asked
if Dr Benton could scrub in
for this.

38:24.977 --> 38:26.217
I'm a friend
of the patient.

38:26.217 --> 38:26.977
He asked if I would observe.

38:26.977 --> 38:28.617
Uh-huh. Put him under.
Let's do this.

38:28.617 --> 38:30.657
Whoa, whoa.
What about the checklist?

38:30.657 --> 38:31.937
Excuse me?

38:31.937 --> 38:34.137
Safe surgery checklist?

38:34.257 --> 38:36.376
I've had ten cases
today, Doctor.

38:36.376 --> 38:38.216
All the more reason to take
the necessary precautions.

38:38.216 --> 38:39.456
It'll only take a minute.

38:39.456 --> 38:41.616
One minute.

38:41.616 --> 38:43.816
John Carter here for a right
cadaveric renal allograft?

38:43.816 --> 38:45.296
Correct.

38:47.336 --> 38:50.216
Does the patient have
a known allergy?

38:50.216 --> 38:51.376
No.

38:51.376 --> 38:52.936
Does anaesthesia anticipate
a difficult airway?

38:52.936 --> 38:54.456
No.
Is the risk of bleeding

38:54.456 --> 38:55.656
greater than 500cc's?

38:55.656 --> 38:58.336
I sure as hell hope not.
Let's go, put him under.

38:58.336 --> 38:59.496
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
everybody slow down.

38:59.496 --> 39:02.616
Now let's just take our time,
and introduce the room.

39:02.616 --> 39:04.256
What's next, we all hold hands

39:04.256 --> 39:05.896
and sing "Kum Ba Yah?"

39:05.896 --> 39:07.656
Sheila Lane, scrub nurse.

39:07.656 --> 39:09.016
Paula Cheney,
circulating nurse.

39:09.016 --> 39:10.976
Kay Schumaker, anaesthesiologist.

39:11.096 --> 39:12.096
Randall Okerman,

39:12.176 --> 39:13.096
chief surgical resident.

39:13.256 --> 39:15.376
Ethan Dean,
surgical intern.

39:15.536 --> 39:17.856
Peter Benton,
observing general surgeon.

39:18.016 --> 39:19.496
Any concerns
from the surgical team?

39:19.656 --> 39:20.856
Only that
you're wasting my time.

39:20.976 --> 39:22.096
Any nursing concerns?

39:22.256 --> 39:23.576
We don't have
any reperfusion solution.

39:23.736 --> 39:24.936
We won't be needing it.
I'll have some sent up.

39:24.936 --> 39:26.416
Were any antibiotics given
within the last 60 minutes?

39:26.496 --> 39:28.896
Just starting them now.

39:28.896 --> 39:29.896
Ten blade.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

39:30.016 --> 39:32.936
If you run the antibiotics prior
to incision, you cut the risk

39:33.056 --> 39:34.776
of infection by half.

39:34.776 --> 39:38.976
Dr Benton, you're a guest here,
and I don't like guests.

39:39.136 --> 39:40.256
As a friend
of the patient,

39:40.416 --> 39:43.816
you're welcome to sit,
observe and shut up.

39:45.376 --> 39:47.736
Ten blade.

39:49.816 --> 39:51.456
STOFSKY:
That sucks.
RASGOTRA:
What?

39:51.456 --> 39:54.456
Not much atrial puff.
The pulmonary artery's
a little short as well.

39:54.536 --> 39:55.496
We can still use it, right?

39:55.656 --> 39:56.856
It's been
seven-and-a-half hours.

39:56.976 --> 39:58.176
We're already
at the limits

39:58.336 --> 39:59.696
of ischaemic time.
Pulse ox is 97.

39:59.856 --> 40:01.616
Fixing this is only going
to prolong the delay.

40:01.776 --> 40:03.456
We don't have a choice.
Sure we do. Leave her on ecmo,

40:03.576 --> 40:04.416
wait for another heart.

40:04.576 --> 40:07.176
What about using the pericardium
as the buttress?

40:07.336 --> 40:09.296
You can use it to graft
to the native atrium.

40:09.456 --> 40:12.136
We're really on the edge here.
Even with prolonged ischaemia,

40:12.256 --> 40:14.536
she's still got a better chance
of surviving with this heart.

40:14.695 --> 40:18.375
We leave her on the ecmo,
she's gonna die.

40:18.495 --> 40:20.295
4-0 proline on an SH needle.

40:20.455 --> 40:22.655
Dr Rasgotra, take us
through the steps.

40:22.815 --> 40:26.295
Donor left atrium
to the native atrial cuff.

40:26.495 --> 40:28.495
KURTAG:
Arterial and venous anastomoses
are complete.

40:28.655 --> 40:30.015
Releasing the clamps.
OKERMAN: Suture lines look good,
no leaks.

40:30.015 --> 40:31.615
KURTAG:
5-0 PDS for the ureter.

40:31.775 --> 40:33.855
Shouldn't we be
pinking up by now?

40:34.055 --> 40:36.015
What happened to sitting quietly
in the corner, Dr Benton?

40:36.175 --> 40:37.495
No, seriously.
Shouldn't it be?

40:40.215 --> 40:43.495
MONITOR BEEPS
Sometimes it takes a minute.

40:43.655 --> 40:46.935
I don't have
a parenchymal pulse.

40:48.015 --> 40:49.735
KURTAG:
Crap.

40:49.855 --> 40:52.135
We've got an arterial thrombosis.
Re-clamp and take down the sutures.

40:52.135 --> 40:53.975
OKERMAN:
Satinsky, please.
Where's the clot?

40:54.135 --> 40:55.615
Renal artery's
obstructing the blood flow.

40:55.735 --> 40:57.735
Gonna have to take it out
and start all over again.

41:02.895 --> 41:04.095
Problem solved.

41:04.215 --> 41:06.215
Flush with heparin, saline
and reperfusion solution.

41:06.335 --> 41:07.335
Reperfusion solution?

41:07.495 --> 41:08.855
We've got it.
We're all set.

41:09.015 --> 41:10.415
Oh, well, it's a good thing we just
had some laying around, huh?

41:10.415 --> 41:12.455
How long did it take
to get the reperfusion

41:12.535 --> 41:13.495
solution up from the pharmacy?

41:13.575 --> 41:14.535
15 minutes.

41:14.695 --> 41:15.815
What happens
if you don't have

41:15.935 --> 41:16.815
the reperfusion solution?

41:16.935 --> 41:17.855
You've made your point, doctor.

41:17.975 --> 41:18.855
I disagree, doctor.

41:18.975 --> 41:21.615
I think that this is an excellent
teaching opportunity, though.

41:21.615 --> 41:23.895
You would have had
15 minutes of warm ischaemia.

41:24.055 --> 41:25.375
The organ would have taken
a major blow,

41:25.455 --> 41:26.615
and there's a good chance

41:26.775 --> 41:28.215
we would have ended up with
a non-functioning kidney.

41:28.295 --> 41:29.775
Wouldn't you agree, doctor?

41:29.895 --> 41:31.255
If we're all done teaching here,

41:31.375 --> 41:32.615
perhaps some of you would like

41:32.735 --> 41:34.655
to assist me in getting this
kidney back

41:34.735 --> 41:36.935
into the patient's body.

41:37.095 --> 41:38.255
Where do you get a copy
of that checklist?

41:38.375 --> 41:41.415
Now, people!

41:41.535 --> 41:42.495
STOFSKY:
How long?

41:42.695 --> 41:44.335
RASGOTRA:
Nine hours and 14 minutes.
I've got the airway.

41:44.335 --> 41:48.055
Get the trans-oesophageal
echo ready... Cut.

41:48.215 --> 41:50.135
Anastamoses are irrigated.

41:50.255 --> 41:52.215
Temp's up to 34.

41:52.335 --> 41:55.054
OK, moment of truth.
Remove the cross clamp.

41:57.374 --> 41:59.454
No oozing at the graft sites.

41:59.574 --> 42:01.174
We've got fibrillation, people.

42:01.334 --> 42:04.054
Paddles to Dr Rasgotra.
Go.

42:04.934 --> 42:05.854
Charged to ten.

42:05.974 --> 42:08.574
Clear!

42:08.734 --> 42:09.414
Still fib.

42:09.534 --> 42:11.174
Going again. Clear!

42:11.334 --> 42:13.614
Fib.
Go again.

42:13.774 --> 42:16.414
Come on, Joanie, sweetheart,
you can do it.

42:16.534 --> 42:17.734
Clear!

42:23.574 --> 42:25.254
Hey.

42:25.454 --> 42:28.374
Where'd you go
this morning?

42:28.534 --> 42:31.214
We were looking
all over for you.

42:31.294 --> 42:32.974
Is he OK?

42:33.134 --> 42:35.454
Yeah, we're gonna keep him
in the hospital

42:35.614 --> 42:39.014
for a few days, but, uh,
he's fine. Um, what's your name?

42:40.694 --> 42:42.054
What?
Your name.

42:42.054 --> 42:44.134
Family services needs
to get a report to the police.

42:44.254 --> 42:46.734
They need to get the address
of the apartment building

42:46.814 --> 42:48.414
where you found him,

42:48.574 --> 42:51.894
see if we can find somebody
who knows anything about him.

42:54.694 --> 42:58.054
I tried, you know,
to take care of him.

42:58.174 --> 42:59.334
I tried really hard.

42:59.454 --> 43:00.534
You did a good job.

43:00.654 --> 43:05.294
Bringing him here
was the right thing to do.

43:05.454 --> 43:09.734
I thought I was gonna
be able to handle it,

43:09.894 --> 43:13.334
but after he was born,
it was just so hard,

43:13.454 --> 43:14.934
and I couldn't deal with it.

43:16.334 --> 43:19.094
You're the mother?

43:19.094 --> 43:22.214
Derrick said he was gonna stay
with me and take care of us,

43:22.374 --> 43:26.014
but he split
a few months ago.

43:26.174 --> 43:30.094
My parents don't want me around.
They hate me.

43:32.374 --> 43:34.973
I just thought
that if I...

43:38.093 --> 43:40.293
So he's really OK?

43:40.293 --> 43:41.373
Yeah.

43:41.493 --> 43:43.173
Look, do you want to hold him?

43:43.333 --> 43:45.213
No.

43:46.613 --> 43:48.893
I just wanted to make sure
he's gonna be all right.

43:49.013 --> 43:50.693
No, please, stay.

43:50.813 --> 43:54.013
Look, you don't have
to decide anything right now.

43:54.173 --> 43:56.373
The weeks after childbirth
are stressful, traumatic.

43:56.493 --> 43:58.293
You may be experiencing
postpartum depression.

43:58.373 --> 44:00.213
We can help you with that.

44:00.373 --> 44:01.613
There are
support groups.

44:01.773 --> 44:05.573
Look, you're just overwhelmed
but that'll pass.

44:05.573 --> 44:07.773
You just have
to give it time!

44:07.893 --> 44:09.813
Please, wait!

44:12.253 --> 44:13.893
He'll have
a good home, OK?

44:14.053 --> 44:17.613
Make sure he has
a good home.

44:32.933 --> 44:35.813
It's been too long,
hasn't it?

44:40.773 --> 44:43.013
These things take time.

44:51.093 --> 44:54.013
Would you like to see her?

45:03.173 --> 45:05.253
(GROANS QUIETLY)

45:10.773 --> 45:12.573
Here, press for Fentanyl.

45:21.012 --> 45:22.092
You're still here?

45:22.252 --> 45:25.012
I don't want
to miss all the fun.

45:27.652 --> 45:28.812
What about Reese?

45:28.892 --> 45:30.652
He's at home with cleo.

45:30.732 --> 45:33.892
Oh...

45:34.012 --> 45:35.292
You and Cleo still...

45:35.412 --> 45:37.772
Yeah.

45:41.812 --> 45:44.972
So, how did it go?

45:46.532 --> 45:48.492
Well...

45:49.812 --> 45:54.612
Oh, that is a beautiful sight.

45:54.612 --> 45:56.972
800cc of liquid gold.

46:03.532 --> 46:05.652
Hey, um...

46:05.772 --> 46:08.372
Is my personal belonging bag

46:08.452 --> 46:09.572
around here someplace?

46:09.692 --> 46:10.852
Yeah, it's right here.

46:10.972 --> 46:12.132
There's a cell phone
in there.

46:12.292 --> 46:14.012
Would you dial
a number for me?

46:14.132 --> 46:15.132
Sure.

46:16.172 --> 46:17.252
Here.

46:17.372 --> 46:20.732
There's a speed dial
toggle to the left there.

46:20.932 --> 46:23.052
John, I know how
to use a cell phone.

46:23.132 --> 46:24.492
It's under K.

46:24.572 --> 46:26.572
Kem.

46:43.732 --> 46:45.092
Hey.

46:47.252 --> 46:49.132
Did I wake you?

46:51.892 --> 46:53.972
I have some really good news.

47:00.931 --> 47:02.811
She's just there.

47:10.091 --> 47:12.051
Oh, go on.

47:12.171 --> 47:13.851
It's OK.

47:13.971 --> 47:15.331
OK.

47:24.731 --> 47:26.771
Hi, Mom.

Carol Hathaway.

47:45.971 --> 47:47.411
Really?

47:47.531 --> 47:49.611
Oh, that's fantastic.

47:49.731 --> 47:51.731
No, no, I appreciate it.

47:51.891 --> 47:53.491
Yeah.
See you in the morning.

47:53.651 --> 47:55.571
Thanks.

47:55.731 --> 47:57.331
Hey...
Hm.

47:58.851 --> 47:59.971
Hey.

48:00.091 --> 48:02.211
That was Cindy.

48:02.211 --> 48:03.891
Chicago called them.

48:03.891 --> 48:05.251
The heart worked.

48:05.451 --> 48:07.371
Went to a 36-year-old woman
with a daughter.

48:07.491 --> 48:08.411
Hm.

48:08.531 --> 48:09.691
And the kidney, too.

48:09.811 --> 48:11.611
Went to some doctor.

48:12.971 --> 48:14.011
Hm.

48:14.171 --> 48:16.091
Not bad
for a day's work, huh?

48:16.211 --> 48:17.811
Not bad.

48:23.971 --> 48:26.091
I love you.

48:26.211 --> 48:27.811
I love you.

48:29.331 --> 48:31.131
(LAUGHS GENTLY)

48:32.305 --> 48:38.720
