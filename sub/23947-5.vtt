[music playing]

00:18.477 --> 00:21.146
[camera clicking]

00:27.694 --> 00:30.239
[Mario] Damn it!
One of our own gets attacked,

00:30.322 --> 00:32.491
and they expect us
to sit on our asses?!

00:32.573 --> 00:34.493
This is bullshit!

00:35.661 --> 00:37.788
-[Boris] Hey...
-Orders are orders.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.666
I don't agree with them,
but what can we do?

00:40.749 --> 00:43.418
-Hey, What's the matter?
-We're told to stand by.

00:43.502 --> 00:45.295
From Eric?

00:45.379 --> 00:47.130
Apparently the security footage

00:47.214 --> 00:48.966
of the entire attack
has been erased.

00:49.049 --> 00:52.427
Hmm. Sounds like we're
dealing with a mole.

00:52.511 --> 00:56.014
We've been instructed to act
discreetly for the time being.

00:56.098 --> 00:58.225
-I assume--
-You've gotta be kidding me!

00:58.308 --> 01:01.061
-Do they not trust us?!
-Calm down.

01:01.144 --> 01:02.354
It's actually the opposite.

01:02.437 --> 01:03.897
You should
really listen to Boris.

01:03.981 --> 01:06.858
The most important thing we need
to do now is keep quiet.

01:06.942 --> 01:08.402
-He needs to see this.
-Boris!

01:08.485 --> 01:10.070
Hmm?

01:11.363 --> 01:14.157
These were outside
the station house.

01:20.372 --> 01:23.292
[footsteps]

01:27.879 --> 01:28.880
[click]

01:33.719 --> 01:36.471
-How did it go?
-We still have to be cautious,

01:36.555 --> 01:39.683
but he seems to be out
of the woods for the time being.

01:39.766 --> 01:41.518
There shouldn't be
any permanent damage.

01:41.601 --> 01:43.437
-[sighs]
-Any defensive wounds?

01:43.520 --> 01:45.605
None I could see superficially.

01:45.689 --> 01:46.898
Based on his injuries,

01:46.982 --> 01:48.900
I would assume
he was attacked without warning

01:48.984 --> 01:50.444
by someone standing next to him.

01:50.527 --> 01:52.779
-Hmm.
-Of course, I'm no expert,

01:52.863 --> 01:54.698
so I can't say for sure.

02:00.203 --> 02:02.164
You're with R.I.S., right?

02:02.247 --> 02:04.041
I hate to trouble you
with formalities,

02:04.124 --> 02:06.001
but I need a signature.

02:06.084 --> 02:08.419
Oh. Sure.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.674
[gasps]

02:12.758 --> 02:14.926
Excuse me. Mr. Flick?

02:15.010 --> 02:16.595
Hmm?

02:19.222 --> 02:21.224
Before he lost consciousness,

02:21.308 --> 02:23.810
he begged me
to do something for him.

02:23.894 --> 02:25.437
He insisted this watch

02:25.520 --> 02:27.314
be delivered
directly to Keith Flick.

02:28.357 --> 02:29.816
[sighs]

02:37.908 --> 02:40.744
[woman vocalizing]

02:53.215 --> 02:55.050
[Eric] Any risk
of permanent damage?

02:55.133 --> 02:57.344
[Lily] <i>They said almost zero.</i>

02:57.427 --> 03:00.430
<i>At most, his wound
<i>might ache on cold days.</i></i>

03:00.514 --> 03:02.599
<i>The doctor
<i>said it was a miracle.</i></i>

03:03.600 --> 03:06.228
[sighs] Understood.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.480
I'll send some people over
to stand guard.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.732
Once they arrive,
I need you and the others

03:10.816 --> 03:12.984
back here immediately
to help us with the case.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.528
<i>But, Eric, we don't wa--</i>

03:14.611 --> 03:16.488
I'll be sending over
Brody and Takeda.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.740
Surely they're better suited
than you and Keith.

03:19.991 --> 03:21.993
<i>I suppose you're right.</i>

03:22.077 --> 03:23.495
Lily...

03:23.578 --> 03:25.747
<i>-Yes?
-keep Bran's condition secret.</i>

03:25.831 --> 03:27.999
There's a chance
he'll be attacked again.

03:28.083 --> 03:31.878
<i>For now, we can't trust
<i>anyone outside the R.I.S.</i></i>

03:31.962 --> 03:33.171
Right.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.563
[strings vibrate]

03:52.065 --> 03:54.067
[playing tune]

03:58.447 --> 03:59.698
[both gasp]

03:59.781 --> 04:00.949
How's that?

04:01.032 --> 04:02.242
It's even better than before.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.494
There's no buzz,
and it's sustaining again.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.496
What was the exact cause
of the problem?

04:06.580 --> 04:08.749
Actually, there were
a few things wrong with it.

04:08.832 --> 04:11.460
Ah, take a look.
I can point them out for you.

04:11.543 --> 04:14.296
[Mr. Hoshina] It's not something
a youngster would understand.

04:14.379 --> 04:16.047
[client] You're
a master craftsman, all right.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.550
-Sure am. [chuckles]
-[child] <i>He's here! He's here!</i>

04:18.632 --> 04:20.719
-[Izanami] <i>Touch Canopus.
-[child] <i>That's him!</i></i>

04:28.435 --> 04:32.105
[woman vocalizes]

04:33.482 --> 04:34.691
[Koku, thinking]
<i>Canopus.</i>

04:43.617 --> 04:44.868
Hey, Keith.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.539
You've been acting weird
ever since the hospital.

04:52.125 --> 04:53.794
What is up with you?

04:53.877 --> 04:56.129
I need to stop at that market.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.506
What?

04:58.590 --> 05:00.342
Hang on. You're shopping?

05:00.425 --> 05:02.093
No, bathroom.

05:02.177 --> 05:03.220
Peeing again?!

05:03.303 --> 05:04.471
Pooping.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.932
Now I know
you're lying for sure.

05:07.015 --> 05:09.309
By all means, come along.

05:09.392 --> 05:10.519
What the heck are--

05:10.602 --> 05:12.103
Hey! Don't just walk away!

05:12.187 --> 05:14.147
Stupid Genie! [groans]

05:16.691 --> 05:18.693
-[typing]
-[computer whirring]

05:27.077 --> 05:28.995
Well, well. This is tough.

05:29.996 --> 05:31.665
[cell phone rings]

05:31.748 --> 05:34.167
-Kaela.
-[Eric] <i>Did you find anything?</i>

05:34.251 --> 05:36.419
Uh, as much
as I'd like to say yes,

05:36.503 --> 05:38.672
all I've found
is a mess inside and out.

05:38.755 --> 05:41.466
And given what's on it,
I can't ask for any help.

05:41.550 --> 05:44.094
-It's gonna take some time.
<i>-I see.</i>

05:44.177 --> 05:46.596
<i>In that case,
<i>call me if anything changes.</i></i>

05:46.680 --> 05:48.598
Eric, just one more thing.

05:48.682 --> 05:52.060
<i>Don't worry.
<i>He's going to be just fine.</i></i>

05:52.143 --> 05:53.687
[sighs]

05:53.770 --> 05:55.272
Thank goodness.

05:55.355 --> 05:56.982
<i>-Kaela.
-Yeah, I know.</i>

05:57.065 --> 05:58.191
Keep it to myself.

05:58.275 --> 06:00.110
<i>-Please do.
-Roger that.</i>

06:02.612 --> 06:06.825
Okay, Brandy, what did you find?

<i>-or I'm--
-When you're free,</i>

06:29.723 --> 06:32.434
please send the following
list of names to my cell phone.

06:33.643 --> 06:35.937
'Kay, just sent it.

06:36.021 --> 06:37.856
<i>Got it. Thanks.</i>

06:37.939 --> 06:39.858
What's it for, anyway?

06:39.941 --> 06:41.234
<i>Don't know yet.</i>

06:41.318 --> 06:42.902
That'll be a trillion yen.

06:42.986 --> 06:45.113
<i>-For what?
-What do you think, man?</i>

06:45.196 --> 06:47.616
I helped you out this time,
but let's be clear.

06:47.699 --> 06:50.201
I ain't running no charity, bro.
Now beat it.

06:51.286 --> 06:53.622
I'm way too busy for this crap.

06:54.873 --> 06:55.707
Hmm?

06:57.709 --> 06:58.710
Hmm.

07:02.797 --> 07:04.716
[gasps] What?

07:04.799 --> 07:05.967
Huh?

07:08.386 --> 07:09.971
[Lily groans]

07:10.055 --> 07:12.933
I know you didn't go in there
just to use the bathroom.

07:13.016 --> 07:16.770
For the umpteenth time, you're
reading way too much into it.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.104
[Lily groans]

07:18.188 --> 07:21.066
Fine! Be that way!
But something here stinks!

07:21.149 --> 07:22.776
Stinks, stinks, stinks!

07:22.859 --> 07:25.695
And for the record, I'm not
just talking about your poop!

07:27.864 --> 07:29.240
[scanner beeps]

07:30.241 --> 07:31.826
[scanner beeps]

07:36.414 --> 07:37.540
Hmm?

07:40.627 --> 07:42.545
That incorrigible old fart

07:42.629 --> 07:45.924
is always trying to leave me
out of the loop. Jerk.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.342
Yaah!

07:47.425 --> 07:48.885
W-What's going on?

07:48.969 --> 07:51.346
Don't move,
and put your hands up.

07:51.429 --> 07:54.057
-What do you think you're doing?
-Hands up in the air!

07:55.433 --> 07:56.893
Now give me your cell phone,

07:56.977 --> 07:59.312
-and make it snappy.
-Huh?

08:01.272 --> 08:03.525
[Minatsuki]
Yes, sir. Understood.

08:03.608 --> 08:05.902
I'll deal with it at once.

08:06.903 --> 08:07.988
[Kamui] What is it?

08:08.071 --> 08:10.448
Seems he's still alive.

08:10.532 --> 08:13.159
Mm, that's easily remedied.

08:13.243 --> 08:16.621
If you want,
I'll see to it personally.

08:16.705 --> 08:18.206
We can't afford to leave behind

08:18.289 --> 08:20.208
any tracks
that might lead back to us.

08:20.291 --> 08:22.085
Have our inside man do it.

08:22.168 --> 08:24.462
But he's already
botched the job once.

08:24.546 --> 08:26.172
Is that a smart idea?

08:26.256 --> 08:28.466
I mean, he is only human.

08:28.550 --> 08:30.719
Just observe, but that's all.

08:30.802 --> 08:32.511
If it looks
like he'll fail again,

08:32.595 --> 08:34.556
feel free to eliminate him.

08:34.639 --> 08:36.099
He can always be replaced.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.267
Understood.

08:40.061 --> 08:43.106
Hey, Minatsuki,
I'm not sure if you've noticed,

08:43.188 --> 08:45.900
but I've already run out
of gold ampules.

08:46.901 --> 08:48.111
More, please!

08:48.194 --> 08:50.613
I hope you're not wasting them.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.039
Hey, who do you think
you're talking to,

08:59.122 --> 09:01.875
you disposable little bitch?

09:03.209 --> 09:05.420
-[Minatsuke] Kamui.
-Mm?

09:06.546 --> 09:07.881
Oh.

09:10.300 --> 09:11.885
Use them more sparingly.

09:13.178 --> 09:14.262
[scoffs]

09:21.436 --> 09:22.812
That's odd.

09:22.896 --> 09:26.066
The time between Kamui's
ampule doses is getting shorter.

09:27.442 --> 09:28.276
Yuna.

09:28.359 --> 09:30.653
I have
not done anything in error.

09:30.737 --> 09:31.738
I know.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.698
I want you
to delete that program

09:33.782 --> 09:35.700
in case things don't work out.

09:35.784 --> 09:38.411
Really? You sure?
It'll make things harder.

09:38.495 --> 09:41.081
Then I'll think
of something else.

09:41.164 --> 09:44.125
That's an order.
Yuna, do it right away.

09:44.209 --> 09:45.293
Yes.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.213
Laica.

09:51.216 --> 09:53.176
Keep an eye on Kamui.

09:55.011 --> 09:56.679
[Kaela] I've got
a pretty good idea

09:56.763 --> 09:58.389
of why someone wanted Bran dead.

09:58.473 --> 09:59.516
Huh?

10:02.769 --> 10:05.563
-Isn't that--
-Yeah, Bran's.

10:05.647 --> 10:06.898
They found it dumped outside.

10:09.234 --> 10:12.362
I was asked to see if I could
reconstruct the data on it.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.614
I did what I could
under the circumstances,

10:14.697 --> 10:16.491
but it's badly fragmented,

10:16.574 --> 10:19.077
and this is the result
of my hard work.

10:24.290 --> 10:26.876
<i>-What do you want for lunch?
-[Lily] Who's that?</i>

10:26.960 --> 10:29.170
<i>-How about sushi?
<i>-Sounds good to me.</i></i>

10:29.254 --> 10:31.297
<i>-Come on, man...
-Are they from our precinct?</i>

10:31.381 --> 10:34.592
Yep. The two guys talking are
both in the Security Division.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.011
-Oh, my goodness, yeah!
-Now look.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.138
<i>...time for that.</i>

10:40.265 --> 10:41.307
[gasps]

10:46.855 --> 10:50.358
[Kaela] I have to admit,
the way it's hidden is clever.

10:50.441 --> 10:54.737
How Bran managed to discover
these files is a total mystery.

10:54.821 --> 10:57.574
The only thing I can say
with absolute certainty

10:57.657 --> 11:00.243
is without help from someone
inside the precinct,

11:00.326 --> 11:02.745
operating this program
would be difficult.

11:12.839 --> 11:15.633
Wait. These video feeds
have all been tapped?

11:15.717 --> 11:18.261
Bingo.
It can jack into the terminals

11:18.344 --> 11:20.680
issued to station personnel
at will,

11:20.763 --> 11:24.142
as well as every camera
and audio source in the station,

11:24.225 --> 11:26.019
even if they're turned off.

11:26.102 --> 11:28.396
Supposedly it has
a pretty limited range, though.

11:28.479 --> 11:29.564
No way.

11:29.647 --> 11:32.025
[Kaela] Creepy, isn't it?

11:32.108 --> 11:33.943
Every now and then,
I'll hear rumors

11:34.027 --> 11:36.154
about the existence
of programs like these.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.697
In my crowd, it's joked about

11:37.780 --> 11:40.074
as nothing more
than an urban legend,

11:40.158 --> 11:42.785
but based on this, it seems
like it's the real deal.

11:42.869 --> 11:44.537
Can you tell who put it there?

11:44.621 --> 11:48.499
Our odds of figuring that out
from this are slim.

11:50.168 --> 11:53.046
Kaela, why don't we
go to Keith with this info?

11:53.129 --> 11:54.297
Keith, huh?

11:54.380 --> 11:56.382
That reminds me.
He called a while ago,

11:56.466 --> 11:58.801
asking for a list
of everyone who's been involved

11:58.885 --> 12:00.803
with the R.I.S.
over the past five years.

12:00.887 --> 12:03.514
-[gasps] A personnel list?
-Mm.

12:03.598 --> 12:05.600
-[computer beeps]
-What the hell?!

12:11.564 --> 12:12.607
Damn, it's gone.

12:12.690 --> 12:14.859
Yeah, they outsmarted us.
Let's go.

12:14.943 --> 12:15.944
Go where?

12:16.027 --> 12:17.820
To find Keith.

12:17.904 --> 12:19.822
<i>I'm sure he's onto something.</i>

12:27.872 --> 12:29.832
[footsteps]

12:35.546 --> 12:39.217
You've just gotten back, Genie,
and look how bad things are.

12:42.053 --> 12:44.847
Do you think your colleague's
going to pull through?

12:44.931 --> 12:48.059
This coffee is much worse
than the cup I had last time.

12:48.142 --> 12:48.977
[chuckles]

12:50.186 --> 12:52.355
I often pondered something
in college,

12:52.438 --> 12:54.857
if I would ever be able
to develop a medicine

12:54.941 --> 12:57.652
that would cure
your twisted frame of mind.

12:57.735 --> 13:00.405
I doubt it.
Because humans weren't designed

13:00.488 --> 13:03.282
by other humans, it's hard
to develop that kind of thing,

13:03.366 --> 13:04.909
especially this.

13:04.993 --> 13:07.870
The mind wasn't designed
to be tampered with by people.

13:07.954 --> 13:10.123
Then I guess
I'll have to file a complaint

13:10.206 --> 13:11.374
with the lead designer.

13:11.457 --> 13:13.209
Who do I talk to about that?

13:13.292 --> 13:16.045
[sighs] I suppose that'd be God.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.006
[sighs]

13:18.089 --> 13:19.882
Whenever the two of us
get together,

13:19.966 --> 13:22.301
I get the worst craving
for a cigarette.

13:24.512 --> 13:28.307
Gil, tell me, have you read
the novel, <i>Moby Dick?</i>

13:28.391 --> 13:30.143
Hmm? That book by Melville?

13:30.226 --> 13:32.854
You lent me a copy ages ago,
remember?

13:32.937 --> 13:34.522
Yeah, I read it.

13:35.606 --> 13:37.233
In his last moments,

13:37.316 --> 13:39.318
I wonder what went
through Ahab's mind

13:39.402 --> 13:41.779
as he was going down
with Moby Dick.

13:43.406 --> 13:44.449
Genie?

13:45.742 --> 13:47.118
It's nothing.

13:47.201 --> 13:48.911
Sorry. Forget about it.

13:48.995 --> 13:52.373
If you'll excuse me,
I'm off to catch our criminal.

14:11.809 --> 14:13.811
[Kamui gasping]

14:23.071 --> 14:24.989
[boys laughing, chatting]

14:28.284 --> 14:29.410
Damn.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.377
[boys chuckle]

14:37.460 --> 14:40.421
This ain't someplace
a big-band wannabe like yourself

14:40.505 --> 14:42.215
should be wanderin' around.
You get me?

14:42.298 --> 14:43.758
If you don't wanna get hurt,

14:43.841 --> 14:46.010
hand over your wallet,
and get lost.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.929
Shut up. [groans]

14:48.012 --> 14:49.430
[boys murmuring]

14:50.473 --> 14:52.016
Where are you off to?

14:52.100 --> 14:54.185
Get out of my way.

14:54.268 --> 14:57.188
You got a death wish
or something, pal?

14:57.271 --> 14:58.106
Huh?!

15:00.650 --> 15:02.568
[boys gasping]

15:08.616 --> 15:10.660
[boys yelling]

15:10.743 --> 15:13.496
[slicing]

15:19.043 --> 15:21.045
[gasping]

15:25.883 --> 15:28.511
[Kamui grunting]

15:28.594 --> 15:30.763
[shrieks]

15:34.725 --> 15:35.935
[sighs]

15:39.522 --> 15:41.149
What's going on in here?!

15:42.525 --> 15:44.944
Put both hands in the air!

15:45.027 --> 15:46.404
Hey! Didn't you hear him?!

15:48.573 --> 15:49.574
[gasps]

15:53.244 --> 15:55.455
You can clean up the mess.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.966
-Mm?
-Where'd they go?

16:07.049 --> 16:10.428
Oh, stepped out for a bit.

16:16.893 --> 16:18.811
Hey, have you seen Keith around?

16:18.895 --> 16:20.938
Huh? Not again.

16:21.022 --> 16:22.315
What are you talking about?

16:22.398 --> 16:24.484
Nothing. He came by a while ago,

16:24.567 --> 16:27.653
but then he turned around
and left.

16:27.737 --> 16:28.988
Thanks.

16:30.615 --> 16:32.408
-Lily.
-Mm.

16:32.492 --> 16:33.951
Since you're on your way out,

16:34.035 --> 16:36.454
would you mind making a delivery
to Takeda and Brody?

16:36.537 --> 16:38.247
It completely slipped my mind.

16:38.331 --> 16:39.165
[sighs]

16:40.166 --> 16:43.044
-[water dripping]
-[humming a tune]

16:44.462 --> 16:46.756
[footsteps echoing]

17:07.944 --> 17:09.779
[resumes humming]

17:29.590 --> 17:32.802
[Keith] Say, now,
isn't that my knife?

17:32.885 --> 17:35.596
You stole it when you
came over for drinks, right?

17:37.807 --> 17:39.767
J.H.R.

17:39.850 --> 17:42.270
I got this beauty from Brandon.

17:42.353 --> 17:44.021
He wanted me to keep it safe.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.191
A vintage French model
that's been hacked,

17:47.275 --> 17:48.526
its knob pulled out.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.861
The hands read 10:08.

17:50.945 --> 17:53.447
The G.M.T. bezel shows 18.

17:53.531 --> 17:55.866
G.M.T. Greenwich Mean Time,

17:55.950 --> 17:57.493
English Standard Time.

17:57.577 --> 18:01.789
Ten, eight, 18.

18:01.872 --> 18:04.125
Converting the hands
into letters,

18:04.208 --> 18:07.878
starting from the top,
we get J, H, R...

18:07.962 --> 18:09.547
and French.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.717
A very simple code,

18:12.800 --> 18:14.802
but a question still remains.

18:14.885 --> 18:16.971
Why would Brandon
do something so intricate

18:17.054 --> 18:18.514
with his life on the line?

18:18.598 --> 18:21.601
He couldn't leave a message
in the elevator,

18:21.684 --> 18:24.562
because his attacker was someone
who could return to the scene

18:24.645 --> 18:26.230
and remove any evidence,

18:26.314 --> 18:28.024
so he started thinking.

18:28.107 --> 18:29.567
Even as his consciousness faded

18:29.650 --> 18:31.569
and he feared
he was going to die,

18:31.652 --> 18:34.530
he frantically thought of a way
to get a message to me.

18:35.656 --> 18:38.492
Five people have those initials,

18:38.576 --> 18:41.704
but there's only one person who
uses the French pronunciation

18:41.787 --> 18:45.666
as a sign of trust and respect
from his fellow detectives.

18:45.750 --> 18:47.960
I didn't want to believe it,

18:48.044 --> 18:50.129
Jean Henri Richard.

18:54.592 --> 18:55.593
[Keith] It's you.

18:58.763 --> 18:59.972
Jean.

19:02.642 --> 19:05.061
Yes, Keith.

19:06.062 --> 19:07.938
So how long have you known?

19:08.022 --> 19:10.066
I first suspected you
eight years ago

19:10.149 --> 19:12.360
when I discovered
the multi-camera program.

19:12.443 --> 19:15.237
It was immediately
after we had solved that case.

19:15.321 --> 19:18.324
Incredible. So you've been
pretending to be my friend

19:18.407 --> 19:20.034
all this time, have you?

19:20.117 --> 19:21.952
As if you're the one to talk.

19:23.037 --> 19:25.498
Listen well, Keith Flick.

19:25.581 --> 19:28.918
For as long as I live,
I'll never forgive you.

19:30.252 --> 19:33.339
I'll do it over
and over and over.

19:34.340 --> 19:35.216
Jean?

19:35.299 --> 19:37.218
Those you care about will die.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.679
They'll all be slaughtered
one by one.

19:40.846 --> 19:43.015
It'll be
just like it was back then.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.767
I'm going
to take away the people

19:44.850 --> 19:49.647
you hold dearest once more
utterly and completely.

19:49.730 --> 19:52.983
Will you be able
to keep them safe this time?

19:53.067 --> 19:54.860
Can you do it?

19:54.944 --> 19:56.821
Can you do it?!

20:03.869 --> 20:06.038
And you will be the last to go.

20:06.122 --> 20:08.874
You'll watch
with those hateful eyes

20:08.958 --> 20:13.129
as everything around you
is reduced to nothing but ruin.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.590
But first, Keith Flick...

20:18.467 --> 20:20.761
Stop it!
Jean, just put the knife down!

20:20.845 --> 20:22.555
[Jean and killer]
You'll bear witness

20:22.638 --> 20:24.557
as those you love
most in the world

20:24.640 --> 20:26.475
are completely covered
in crimson.

20:26.559 --> 20:27.476
Eh?

20:27.560 --> 20:29.895
[together] Like the cycle
of death and rebirth,

20:29.979 --> 20:33.232
it will repeat itself,
continuing forever,

20:33.315 --> 20:36.235
and an indelible code
will be etched into you.

20:39.697 --> 20:44.160
I'll never forget
that I was murdered by you.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.911
See you in hell.

20:45.995 --> 20:47.663
Jean!

21:04.930 --> 21:07.808
[groans]

21:09.018 --> 21:10.019
Jean.

21:14.482 --> 21:15.691
Huh?

21:22.490 --> 21:23.824
[shudders]

21:40.382 --> 21:41.550
[gasps]

21:46.764 --> 21:48.015
Jean!

21:48.098 --> 21:49.099
Help! Somebody!

21:49.183 --> 21:51.101
I need some help in here
right now!

21:52.228 --> 21:53.562
I have a Code One!

21:53.646 --> 21:57.733
An officer has been stabbed and
badly injured at Royal Hospital!

21:57.817 --> 21:59.568
-The attacker is at large!
-Keith...

21:59.652 --> 22:01.487
They're likely
still in the area!

22:01.570 --> 22:03.239
-Requesting immediate dispatch!
-...run.

22:04.240 --> 22:06.242
-Jean! Come on, Jean.
-Keith...

22:06.325 --> 22:09.119
Don't you die on me!
Hang in there.

22:12.623 --> 22:13.958
Jean.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.336
[rain pattering]

22:21.674 --> 22:23.217
[groans]

22:24.844 --> 22:26.845
[groaning]

22:33.644 --> 22:35.563
[Koku] Are you Canopus?

22:40.442 --> 22:42.027
[Keith] Well...

22:43.612 --> 22:45.739
so we meet at last, huh...

22:47.491 --> 22:49.994
Killer B.
