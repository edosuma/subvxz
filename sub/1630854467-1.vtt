WEBVTT

01:07.776 --> 01:10.070
Ten tiny typists
tripped through the tunnel.

01:10.153 --> 01:12.072
Ten tiny typists
tripped through the tunnel.

01:12.155 --> 01:13.323
Ten tiny typists...

01:13.407 --> 01:15.868
-You can't be in here.
-Compliments of the house. Enjoy it.

01:15.951 --> 01:17.369
-Sir.
-It's delicious.

01:17.452 --> 01:21.081
Tell him callbacks are next week
and he'll know when he knows.

01:21.164 --> 01:21.999
Okay.

01:25.460 --> 01:27.671
<i>Okay,</i> Show Us What You Got.

01:27.754 --> 01:31.258
<i>Contestant 318, you are up next.</i>

01:31.341 --> 01:32.259
He wasn't next.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.720
-Where's your number?
-I have no time to waste.

01:34.803 --> 01:36.054
Magical magic.

01:36.805 --> 01:37.931
Wait a minute, man.

01:38.557 --> 01:40.601
No, no, no.

01:40.684 --> 01:43.312
Hector, we told you after last time,
no more.

01:43.395 --> 01:48.108
That was just my song-and-dance routine.
My new act will blow your minds.

01:48.192 --> 01:52.237
Prepare yourself
for the Dance of a Thousand Pigeons.

01:53.655 --> 01:54.948
Yes.

01:56.491 --> 01:57.492
That's enough.

01:58.243 --> 01:59.161
Thank you.

02:00.412 --> 02:01.246
Maybe...

02:01.872 --> 02:03.540
Maybe go back to singing.

02:04.958 --> 02:05.792
Security.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.466
Seriously, dude?

02:12.549 --> 02:14.134
Ditch the birds.

02:14.218 --> 02:16.553
Show them something
they've never seen before.

02:17.137 --> 02:19.681
Because whatever that was, ain't working.

03:05.143 --> 03:07.855
Hi, I'm looking for something...

03:07.938 --> 03:09.064
Something...

03:09.898 --> 03:11.400
Something unusual.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.693
But cute.

03:12.776 --> 03:14.862
Really, really cute.

03:14.945 --> 03:16.196
Also affordable.

03:17.072 --> 03:20.075
That I can fit under my hat,

03:20.784 --> 03:22.077
while I am dancing.

03:22.744 --> 03:25.539
We got a special on bird-eating spiders.

03:27.165 --> 03:28.834
Okay, let's try this again.

03:28.917 --> 03:30.169
Boa constrictor.

03:30.794 --> 03:32.129
Vampire bat.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.131
Might have a lemur in the back.

03:38.969 --> 03:40.345
A lemur.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.105
<i>I like it like that</i>

03:55.694 --> 03:57.029
<i>I like it like that</i>

03:57.112 --> 03:59.323
<i>Like that, baby</i>

04:02.826 --> 04:05.245
<i>Oh, I said
I like it like that</i>

04:06.330 --> 04:07.956
<i>I like it like that</i>

04:08.957 --> 04:10.834
<i>Yeah, I like it like</i>

04:10.918 --> 04:14.338
<i>Stomp your feet
If you think I'm neat</i>

04:14.421 --> 04:17.925
<i>Clap your hands
If you want some more</i>

04:18.466 --> 04:20.719
<i>Yeah, baby</i>

04:21.637 --> 04:23.138
<i>Like it
Like it</i>

04:23.222 --> 04:24.139
<i>Like it like</i>

04:24.223 --> 04:25.724
<i>I like it like that</i>

04:25.807 --> 04:29.686
<i>Yeah, I really like it like that...</i>

04:29.770 --> 04:32.940
A singing crocodile.

04:33.774 --> 04:36.568
<i>Baby, I like it like that</i>

04:40.030 --> 04:42.866
LYLE

04:42.950 --> 04:44.409
"Lyle." Lyle.

04:52.125 --> 04:57.130
Hector P. Valenti,
star of stage and screen, at your service.

05:20.279 --> 05:23.615
My reptilian friend, welcome home.

05:23.699 --> 05:25.200
We're family now.

05:26.368 --> 05:27.202
Come.

05:36.295 --> 05:37.588
Okay, let's go.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.065
Come on, Lyle.

05:57.149 --> 05:59.693
I know you don't talk, but you can sing.

06:33.352 --> 06:37.189
<i>You can pack your bags
And start skipping town</i>

06:37.856 --> 06:40.734
<i>Hang up that hat
When the show shuts down</i>

06:40.817 --> 06:45.948
<i>But when the world says
You ain't quite world-renowned</i>

06:46.031 --> 06:48.617
<i>Don't count yourself out yet</i>

06:49.451 --> 06:52.496
<i>When you hit that lonely and lowest low</i>

06:52.579 --> 06:55.541
<i>Well, up's the only way left to go</i>

06:55.624 --> 06:58.544
<i>You're meant to reinvent the show</i>

06:58.627 --> 07:01.338
<i>So ain't you glad we met?</i>

07:01.421 --> 07:04.550
<i>Turn that dull and dusty solo</i>

07:04.633 --> 07:07.469
<i>To a dazzling duet</i>

07:12.391 --> 07:14.810
<i>Maybe we started pretty small</i>

07:14.893 --> 07:16.478
<i>But take a look at us now</i>

07:16.562 --> 07:18.397
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

07:18.480 --> 07:21.191
<i>Suddenly standing 10 feet tall</i>

07:21.275 --> 07:22.651
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

07:22.734 --> 07:24.820
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

07:24.903 --> 07:27.906
<i>Though we had no way
To stay afloat</i>

07:27.990 --> 07:31.326
<i>We were scared they'd say
It was all she wrote</i>

07:31.410 --> 07:36.665
<i>We're ending on a sky-high note
Somehow</i>

07:37.249 --> 07:39.668
<i>Buddy, you were all it took</i>

07:39.751 --> 07:41.753
<i>So take a look at us now</i>

07:42.880 --> 07:44.506
You already owe me for the last show.

07:44.590 --> 07:45.799
Yes, but this one's special.

07:45.883 --> 07:48.010
Then you pay me up-front. In cash.

07:48.093 --> 07:50.262
Cash might be a problem.

07:50.345 --> 07:54.057
But I have something far more valuable.

08:05.444 --> 08:08.822
<i>When that perfect plan's
Going off the rails</i>

08:08.906 --> 08:11.700
<i>A heap of trouble is on our tails</i>

08:11.783 --> 08:14.870
<i>It's time to polish up those scales</i>

08:14.953 --> 08:16.955
<i>And give it all you got</i>

08:17.623 --> 08:18.874
<i>If you're out of step</i>

08:18.957 --> 08:20.334
<i>If you're out of sync</i>

08:20.417 --> 08:23.420
<i>And you care too much
What those critics think</i>

08:23.504 --> 08:26.340
<i>Well, when you find your missing link</i>

08:26.423 --> 08:28.759
<i>They don't get a second thought</i>

08:28.842 --> 08:31.929
<i>'Cause in the center of the spotlight</i>

08:32.011 --> 08:34.765
<i>We just might have found our spot</i>

08:34.847 --> 08:37.392
<i>Trying our luck with every leap</i>

08:37.476 --> 08:38.936
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

08:39.019 --> 08:40.895
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

08:40.979 --> 08:43.398
<i>The road could be steady
Could be steep</i>

08:43.482 --> 08:44.858
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

08:44.942 --> 08:46.860
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

08:46.944 --> 08:49.738
<i>Thought we might be sunk
Upon first glance</i>

08:49.821 --> 08:53.450
<i>Well, who'd have thunk
That we had a chance?</i>

08:53.534 --> 08:58.997
<i>And life could be
A song and dance somehow</i>

08:59.081 --> 09:00.791
<i>Buddy, you were all it took</i>

09:00.874 --> 09:03.418
<i>So take a look at us now</i>

09:10.217 --> 09:11.844
Thirty seconds to curtain.

09:11.927 --> 09:14.304
Got a full house out there. Break a leg.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.766
<i>So even when you're terrified</i>

09:17.850 --> 09:21.353
<i>Just smile a smile a mile wide</i>

09:21.436 --> 09:24.273
<i>'Cause, bud, when you and I collide</i>

09:24.356 --> 09:26.233
<i>Standing side by side</i>

09:26.316 --> 09:32.322
<i>We're gonna take a great big bow</i>

09:32.406 --> 09:37.953
<i>Won't you take a look at us now</i>

09:41.248 --> 09:43.959
<i>Give us a spotlight and a crowd</i>

09:44.042 --> 09:46.003
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

09:47.087 --> 09:49.631
<i>Ready to sing our song out loud</i>

09:49.715 --> 09:51.550
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

09:52.092 --> 09:53.677
Lyle.

10:00.559 --> 10:01.852
Lyle.

10:01.935 --> 10:02.769
Lyle, sing.

10:03.353 --> 10:04.563
Sing, Lyle.

10:04.646 --> 10:05.480
Please.

10:07.482 --> 10:11.445
<i>Won't you take a look at us</i>

10:11.528 --> 10:14.823
<i>Take a look at us</i>

10:14.907 --> 10:17.826
<i>Take a look at us</i>

10:43.769 --> 10:44.770
Drop the curtain.

10:45.604 --> 10:46.438
Come on.

11:14.424 --> 11:16.176
What's that look for?

11:17.219 --> 11:19.805
We've had a minor setback, nothing more.

11:20.430 --> 11:21.265
Yes.

11:22.015 --> 11:25.352
I'll go on the road for a bit,
and make some cash.

11:26.979 --> 11:28.730
Here, take this.

11:29.481 --> 11:32.109
It's got every song you'll ever need.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.902
The best companion there is.

11:36.238 --> 11:37.114
Okay.

11:59.636 --> 12:02.556
Okay, I'll be back
in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

12:03.307 --> 12:07.936
And remember, if anyone asks,
tell them you are stuffed.

12:10.939 --> 12:11.773
Okay.

12:41.345 --> 12:43.639
-You got it?
-Yeah, I'm good.

12:44.473 --> 12:47.518
-Couple more.
-Straight to the living room, brother.

12:49.186 --> 12:51.230
Are we actually gonna be living here?

12:52.606 --> 12:53.982
I think we are.

12:54.066 --> 12:55.901
This is a really bad idea.

12:55.984 --> 12:59.947
Do you realize Manhattan crime statistics
have seen a year-on-year increase

13:00.030 --> 13:01.490
of over 18 percent?

13:01.573 --> 13:04.868
Most people move out of the city
when they have kids, not into it.

13:05.827 --> 13:06.662
Ready?

13:09.373 --> 13:11.792
And you must be the Primms.

13:11.875 --> 13:15.546
I am so pleased to meet you.
I'm Carol from Liberty Day School.

13:15.629 --> 13:17.297
We're so excited to be here.

13:17.381 --> 13:19.216
Your new Math Department chair.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.926
We are very pleased to have you.

13:21.009 --> 13:24.137
If you can just sign these
when you get the chance.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.557
Oh, and this is our son Josh.

13:27.683 --> 13:30.519
Plus we haven't even talked about
the widespread use of lead paint.

13:30.602 --> 13:32.938
-New city. Little nervous.
-Sure.

13:33.021 --> 13:36.567
Oh, can I tell you
how much of a fan I am of your cookbooks?

13:36.650 --> 13:39.152
-Right?
-I can't wait to see what you do next.

13:39.236 --> 13:42.573
You know, I'm actually
scaling it back a bit work-wise,

13:42.656 --> 13:44.867
so I could spend more time with Josh.

13:44.950 --> 13:48.829
And this is Mr. Grumps,
your downstairs neighbor.

13:48.912 --> 13:49.913
Hey, how's it going?

13:49.997 --> 13:54.293
The local housing administration has
established strict noise abatement rules.

13:54.376 --> 13:57.671
-Make sure you read them.
-Yeah, of course.

13:58.255 --> 14:00.966
-We certainly will, won't we, darling?
-Of course.

14:01.049 --> 14:03.719
That is the most beautiful cat
I've ever seen.

14:03.802 --> 14:06.513
Loretta is not a cat.

14:06.597 --> 14:09.808
She's a Silver Shaded Persian
with an extremely delicate constitution.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.269
Do not feed her
or let her out of the building.

14:12.352 --> 14:14.730
Why don't we go upstairs? Yeah, come on.

14:14.813 --> 14:18.192
I'll be watching them.
My lawyers will be watching them too.

14:18.275 --> 14:21.820
One foot out of place, and they'll be out,
and you'll be forced to sell.

14:21.904 --> 14:22.738
Okay?

14:22.821 --> 14:24.489
I'd say his bark's worse than his bite,

14:24.573 --> 14:27.117
but to be honest,
his bite's pretty unpleasant too.

14:27.201 --> 14:29.828
Amazing cat, though. Can we have a pet?

14:29.912 --> 14:31.872
Josh, allergies.

14:31.955 --> 14:32.956
I know.

14:35.083 --> 14:39.171
FYI, there's a few leftovers
from a previous owner in the attic.

14:39.254 --> 14:40.839
Hopefully they won't get in your way.

14:41.423 --> 14:42.508
Welcome home.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.263
Babe, can I put this here?

14:48.347 --> 14:49.181
You hate it.

14:49.264 --> 14:50.098
No.

14:51.475 --> 14:53.435
New York City.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.064
-Did we just move here?
-I think we did.

14:59.983 --> 15:01.902
You think Josh is gonna be okay?

15:01.985 --> 15:04.738
Are you kidding me?
He's got his own floor up there.

15:04.821 --> 15:06.949
He's probably having the time of his life.

15:11.870 --> 15:12.704
What was that?

15:12.788 --> 15:14.206
<i>That is an ambulance.</i>

15:17.251 --> 15:18.168
What was that?

15:18.252 --> 15:19.711
<i>That was a car tire.</i>

15:22.881 --> 15:23.715
What was that?

15:26.343 --> 15:28.262
<i>I have no idea what that was.</i>

16:34.411 --> 16:38.040
"This is my crocodile.
Please, take good care of him.

16:38.123 --> 16:41.126
Cordially yours, Hector P. Valenti."

16:43.754 --> 16:44.755
"Lyle."

17:06.777 --> 17:08.779
Tofu kale breakfast bowl.

17:08.862 --> 17:11.406
Swiss chard chickpea scramble.

17:11.490 --> 17:14.535
-Vegan turmeric latte.
-I thought it was in...

17:14.617 --> 17:17.162
Three different recipes
from three different books.

17:17.246 --> 17:18.372
It's perfect.

17:18.454 --> 17:21.750
Oh, honey,
this looks amazing, and healthy.

17:22.291 --> 17:24.627
But I gotta go. I can't be late.
Where's Josh?

17:24.711 --> 17:26.255
I'm taking Josh, remember?

17:27.130 --> 17:27.964
Right.

17:28.048 --> 17:28.966
Grab something.

17:30.259 --> 17:31.885
Have you seen my glasses?

17:34.054 --> 17:34.888
-Thank you.
-Hey.

17:34.972 --> 17:36.014
Yeah?

17:36.098 --> 17:38.767
You got this, okay?
They're lucky to have you.

17:39.309 --> 17:40.936
I'm lucky to have you.

17:41.812 --> 17:44.481
-Don't forget to sign up for wrestling.
-Okay.

17:45.190 --> 17:47.985
-We gotta go.
-Josh, there's time for breakfast.

17:48.068 --> 17:51.655
No, it's an 11-minute ride on the subway
from East 86th to West Farms Square,

17:51.738 --> 17:54.783
plus a four-minute walk at this end
and a seven-minute walk at the other.

17:54.867 --> 17:56.326
Assuming everything goes right.

17:58.078 --> 18:02.291
Keep up, Mom. All the way down to the end.
Then we just cross this little avenue.

18:18.724 --> 18:21.226
<i>This is 86th Street Station.</i>

18:24.897 --> 18:25.731
Excuse me.

18:26.815 --> 18:28.567
-Watch it.
-Wrong side, kid.

18:28.650 --> 18:29.484
Excuse me.

18:30.152 --> 18:31.153
Move, move.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.754
<i>Stand clear of the closing doors, please.</i>

18:53.300 --> 18:55.219
Don't worry, you got this.

18:55.302 --> 18:56.845
"You got this."

19:07.481 --> 19:08.315
Seriously?

19:08.398 --> 19:09.983
What are you doing?

19:10.067 --> 19:12.903
-Do you not see us filming here?
-Come on, man.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.113
-Do you mind?
-Dude, are you serious?

19:15.197 --> 19:16.573
He's literally filming.

19:17.324 --> 19:18.575
Let's go, guys.

19:18.659 --> 19:21.286
Watch it on Sweep
like everyone else, pumpkin.

19:21.370 --> 19:22.788
-Whatever.
-Weirdo.

19:38.345 --> 19:39.888
Featherweights, you're up.

19:40.848 --> 19:42.683
And wrestle.

19:42.766 --> 19:44.184
Look for the single leg.

19:46.270 --> 19:47.437
Come on.

20:36.111 --> 20:39.406
<i>I'm Trudy, and I'm auditioning
for </i>Show Us What You Got<i>.</i>

21:03.388 --> 21:04.681
Loretta.

21:05.641 --> 21:07.434
Go ahead. That milk's for you.

21:09.978 --> 21:11.188
Hey.

21:17.694 --> 21:20.030
<i>Hey, remember me</i>

21:22.574 --> 21:25.410
<i>Hey, remember me</i>

21:28.288 --> 21:31.792
<i>You'll always remember me</i>

21:45.973 --> 21:48.016
Okay. Stay close.

22:26.138 --> 22:27.097
No!

22:33.520 --> 22:34.730
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

22:55.000 --> 22:57.169
Wait. No, you have to give her back.

23:28.242 --> 23:29.785
Did you see that?

23:29.868 --> 23:31.119
Dude, that was crazy.

23:32.663 --> 23:33.497
Wait.

23:37.501 --> 23:38.961
Hey, watch where you're going!

23:40.170 --> 23:41.004
Hey!

23:58.230 --> 23:59.231
Hey, kid.

24:00.315 --> 24:04.361
You gonna give me that phone,
or am I gonna have to take it from you?

24:32.764 --> 24:35.684
That was totally awesome.

24:49.489 --> 24:51.366
Wait, you gotta show me how to get back.

25:02.169 --> 25:04.546
Okay, last box.

25:06.256 --> 25:08.467
Why did we even bring all this stuff?

25:10.886 --> 25:12.888
Don't eat those. They're horrible.

25:12.971 --> 25:15.641
What? You love these things.

25:15.724 --> 25:19.269
You used to bake with cherries.
You made us put them on our wedding cake.

25:19.353 --> 25:22.898
I know I did, but that was
before I found out what's in them.

25:22.981 --> 25:27.027
They're full of hydrogenated palm oil,
and sugar, and corn syrup.

25:27.110 --> 25:29.988
We wanna set a good example for Josh.
We should throw them out.

25:37.829 --> 25:39.665
Outside in the garbage.

25:58.517 --> 25:59.351
Hey.

26:00.018 --> 26:02.062
Those are my trash cans,
not your trash cans.

26:02.145 --> 26:03.105
Yours are in the back.

26:03.188 --> 26:04.648
Oh, right. I'm so sorry.

26:04.731 --> 26:05.649
Sorry is right.

26:05.732 --> 26:09.778
Don't come around scattering
suburban mediocrity all over my trash.

26:09.862 --> 26:11.822
-I didn't know.
-Someone's been feeding my cat.

26:11.905 --> 26:12.906
I wanna know who.

26:12.990 --> 26:15.993
Do you have any idea how dangerous
irritable bowel syndrome can be

26:16.076 --> 26:17.703
in a cat as valuable as Loretta?

26:17.786 --> 26:20.205
If I catch you,
or your wife, or your horrible son

26:20.289 --> 26:23.750
so much as looking at Loretta,
my lawyers will be all over you.

26:23.834 --> 26:25.335
Do I make myself clear?

26:25.419 --> 26:26.837
Now, hold on a minute.

26:26.920 --> 26:28.255
-Yes or no?
-Yes.

26:28.338 --> 26:30.132
-Yes, yes, yes.
-Great.

26:30.215 --> 26:34.011
Oh, please, use more of the hot water.
Help yourself.

26:34.094 --> 26:37.389
-There's plenty to go around.
-What? Hot water?

26:45.230 --> 26:46.690
Hey, hi.

26:46.773 --> 26:47.858
You awake yet?

26:49.318 --> 26:50.152
Here.

26:51.445 --> 26:54.615
This is my Plus Four Strength card.

26:55.616 --> 26:59.453
It's the most valuable card in my deck,
and I want you to have it.

27:03.957 --> 27:05.250
Josh, where are you?

27:05.334 --> 27:06.710
Okay, I gotta go.

27:06.793 --> 27:08.754
And I'll be back after 3, okay?

27:10.797 --> 27:12.216
An actual pet.

27:19.473 --> 27:20.766
Hey, Josh, let's go.

27:20.849 --> 27:22.267
Taking a shortcut.

27:23.393 --> 27:24.228
What?

27:26.146 --> 27:27.147
Josh.

27:30.275 --> 27:31.109
Wait.

27:41.119 --> 27:41.954
Josh?

27:42.037 --> 27:42.871
This way.

27:52.339 --> 27:53.173
Josh.

27:54.174 --> 27:55.008
Hey.

28:03.016 --> 28:03.851
Josh.

28:04.393 --> 28:05.227
What's up?

28:11.817 --> 28:13.819
Don't worry. I got this.

29:04.995 --> 29:06.538
<i>I wanna stop</i>

29:07.080 --> 29:08.957
<i>And thank you, baby</i>

29:09.041 --> 29:10.959
<i>I just wanna stop</i>

29:11.710 --> 29:13.837
<i>And thank you, baby</i>

29:13.921 --> 29:15.005
<i>Oh, yes</i>

29:15.088 --> 29:19.676
<i>How sweet it is to be loved by you</i>

29:20.594 --> 29:23.597
<i>It's just like sugar sometimes</i>

29:24.181 --> 29:26.308
<i>How sweet it is</i>

29:26.391 --> 29:27.643
<i>Oh, your book.</i>

29:27.726 --> 29:29.478
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

29:29.561 --> 29:31.813
<i>That cake's gonna make you famous.</i>

29:37.986 --> 29:40.822
<i>-That was a modest bite.
-Wait, wait. No, no, no.</i>

29:44.326 --> 29:45.786
<i>How about another taste?</i>

29:45.869 --> 29:47.663
<i>And thank you, baby</i>

29:47.746 --> 29:49.498
<i>I just wanna stop</i>

29:50.249 --> 29:52.292
<i>And thank you, baby</i>

30:30.789 --> 30:31.915
Hey, Animal Planet.

30:32.624 --> 30:34.168
What's with all the books?

30:37.129 --> 30:38.380
You won't believe me.

30:42.092 --> 30:44.386
I kind of have a...

30:45.596 --> 30:46.972
pet crocodile.

30:48.432 --> 30:50.058
Nobody has a pet crocodile.

30:50.142 --> 30:51.143
Told you.

30:51.226 --> 30:53.979
And absolutely nobody
has a pet crocodile in the city.

30:54.062 --> 30:56.064
My dad had to do free dental work
for the mayor

30:56.148 --> 30:58.901
just to get my pet rattlesnake
allowed in our building.

30:58.984 --> 31:01.737
I saw you on Sweep.

31:02.529 --> 31:03.947
I mean, like, not...

31:04.031 --> 31:05.282
I didn't... It was...

31:12.247 --> 31:14.374
You're kind of a weirdo, aren't you?

31:16.001 --> 31:16.835
Yeah.

31:34.061 --> 31:36.897
I've always approached our life
like one of my recipes.

31:36.980 --> 31:40.609
When things get hard,
we stick with the ingredients that work.

31:41.151 --> 31:44.112
But now it's all different,
and I still feel bad.

31:44.738 --> 31:45.781
About what?

31:47.366 --> 31:48.909
Josh growing up.

31:48.992 --> 31:50.118
Oh, honey.

31:50.202 --> 31:52.704
I know that I should feel happy, but...

31:54.915 --> 31:57.543
I wish I just didn't feel so left out.

31:57.626 --> 31:58.460
Hey.

31:59.461 --> 32:03.006
You're a huge part of Josh's life,
and an amazing mother.

32:04.007 --> 32:04.842
All right?

32:05.717 --> 32:06.552
Hey.

32:07.219 --> 32:09.429
We were lost until you found us.

32:42.754 --> 32:43.839
What...?

33:00.314 --> 33:01.690
You want me to...?

33:02.232 --> 33:06.361
Okay, okay. See, the thing is
I've never dumpster dived before, so...

33:07.196 --> 33:08.030
Okay.

33:08.572 --> 33:09.406
Okay.

33:12.701 --> 33:13.535
What...?

33:15.954 --> 33:17.331
So gross.

33:27.341 --> 33:28.175
Let's see.

33:29.134 --> 33:30.427
You like noodles?

33:54.826 --> 33:56.203
Oh, my God.

34:33.114 --> 34:34.783
No, that's okay.

34:34.867 --> 34:37.536
I have sort of quite a specific diet,

34:37.619 --> 34:40.455
which is mostly Bagel Bites, so I'm...

34:42.623 --> 34:44.793
I'm not sure if that's gonna taste--

34:50.174 --> 34:53.092
Wow, that's actually amazing.

34:54.761 --> 34:57.181
I've never had anything like that before.

34:59.183 --> 35:00.309
Where are you from?

35:00.851 --> 35:02.728
My mom's family is from Taiwan.

35:02.811 --> 35:05.230
Well, she's actually my stepmom.

35:05.898 --> 35:07.608
My mom died when I was 2.

35:09.776 --> 35:11.403
My dad says I got her nose.

35:12.946 --> 35:15.866
I can do this really,
like, crazy thing with my knuckles

35:15.949 --> 35:20.037
where if I, like, go like that,
I can, like, crack them all.

35:21.788 --> 35:23.081
Do you have knuckles?

35:24.541 --> 35:25.584
What is that?

35:35.385 --> 35:37.721
You don't talk, do you?

35:55.364 --> 35:58.283
<i>In the shadow of the city</i>

35:58.367 --> 36:01.870
<i>When the days have disappeared</i>

36:03.121 --> 36:05.916
<i>Some might say it's sort of gritty</i>

36:05.999 --> 36:10.254
<i>Full of faces to be feared</i>

36:10.337 --> 36:14.633
<i>But there are wonders that are waiting</i>

36:14.716 --> 36:17.553
<i>Underneath the midnight sky</i>

36:17.636 --> 36:22.140
<i>We got the stars illuminating</i>

36:22.224 --> 36:25.602
<i>It's a place for you and I</i>

36:25.686 --> 36:30.232
<i>A little space for you and I</i>

36:30.774 --> 36:33.986
<i>At the top of the world tonight</i>

36:34.069 --> 36:37.656
<i>Where no one ever has to hide</i>

36:37.739 --> 36:40.742
<i>At the top of the world tonight</i>

36:41.410 --> 36:45.122
<i>You're sitting safe and starry-eyed</i>

36:45.205 --> 36:47.666
<i>There is treasure you can find</i>

36:48.208 --> 36:50.627
<i>In something someone left behind</i>

36:52.004 --> 36:55.215
<i>At the top of the world tonight</i>

36:55.299 --> 36:57.259
<i>It can stay this way</i>

36:57.342 --> 37:00.137
<i>At least until the morning light</i>

37:13.942 --> 37:16.778
<i>Through the dark
There's someone singing</i>

37:16.862 --> 37:20.449
<i>Like an old familiar song</i>

37:20.532 --> 37:23.660
<i>Like you fell
Into a melody that's bringing</i>

37:23.744 --> 37:28.040
<i>You right here
Where you can belong</i>

37:28.123 --> 37:32.461
<i>And there are wonders that are waiting</i>

37:32.544 --> 37:35.589
<i>Underneath the midnight sky</i>

37:35.672 --> 37:39.927
<i>And by the stars we're navigating</i>

37:40.010 --> 37:44.598
<i>To a place for you and I</i>

37:44.681 --> 37:47.935
<i>At the top of the world tonight</i>

37:48.519 --> 37:51.813
<i>Where no one ever has to hide</i>

37:51.897 --> 37:54.983
<i>At the top of the world tonight</i>

37:55.567 --> 37:58.987
<i>You're sitting safe and starry-eyed</i>

37:59.071 --> 38:02.032
<i>There is treasure you can find</i>

38:02.115 --> 38:05.536
<i>In something someone left behind</i>

38:06.328 --> 38:09.498
<i>At the top of the world tonight</i>

38:09.581 --> 38:11.500
<i>It can stay this way</i>

38:11.583 --> 38:14.169
<i>At least until the morning light</i>

38:20.551 --> 38:22.511
<i>At the top of the world</i>

38:22.594 --> 38:26.056
<i>The top of the world</i>

38:26.139 --> 38:28.976
<i>The top of the world tonight</i>

38:34.857 --> 38:36.149
Yeah!

38:51.373 --> 38:52.916
Yes, it's an emergency.

38:53.000 --> 38:56.795
The city must do something
about these double-wide strollers.

38:56.879 --> 39:02.593
You know, just because somebody
made the mistake of having a second child

39:02.676 --> 39:06.597
doesn't mean that
I should be forced off the sidewalk,

39:06.680 --> 39:07.514
into the...

39:08.807 --> 39:09.808
streets.

39:13.937 --> 39:15.063
Mumsykins?

39:21.570 --> 39:22.738
Have a great day.

39:22.821 --> 39:24.031
You too, honey.

39:24.114 --> 39:25.699
Josh, time to wake up.

39:25.782 --> 39:26.617
Come on.

39:27.659 --> 39:28.493
Josh?

39:35.250 --> 39:36.543
All right, Josh, come on.

39:36.627 --> 39:37.461
Let's go.

39:43.342 --> 39:44.551
Mom, no, hold on.

39:44.635 --> 39:45.636
Oh, my God.

39:45.719 --> 39:46.553
He's safe.

39:54.394 --> 39:55.646
No, Mom, it's okay.

39:59.274 --> 40:00.817
<i>I wanna stop</i>

40:01.777 --> 40:03.779
<i>And thank you, baby</i>

40:04.488 --> 40:06.406
<i>I just wanna stop</i>

40:07.616 --> 40:09.618
<i>And thank you, baby</i>

40:10.160 --> 40:11.578
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

40:11.662 --> 40:16.041
<i>How sweet it is to be loved by you</i>

40:16.625 --> 40:18.126
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

40:18.210 --> 40:23.257
<i>How sweet it is to be loved by you</i>

40:26.927 --> 40:28.887
Mom, I swear, he's not dangerous.

40:28.971 --> 40:32.224
-He's a crocodile.
-Okay, yes, crocodiles are dangerous.

40:32.307 --> 40:34.643
They bite through bone
and have a taste for human flesh.

40:34.726 --> 40:36.728
But he's not like that. He wears a scarf.

40:36.812 --> 40:38.438
I have to tell your father.

40:38.522 --> 40:41.441
-No, he'll have him taken away.
-I'll agree with him.

40:41.525 --> 40:44.069
-No.
-<i>Thanks for calling. Leave a message.</i>

40:44.152 --> 40:47.364
Lyle is a good crocodile.
He's just lonely, like I was.

40:48.115 --> 40:49.533
And he cares about me.

40:49.616 --> 40:52.369
Do you realize how different
things have been since I met him?

40:52.911 --> 40:54.246
I made a friend.

40:54.329 --> 40:57.124
Mom, I feel like I belong here,
because of Lyle.

40:57.207 --> 41:00.085
-Josh.
-You won't even see him. He's nocturnal.

41:00.169 --> 41:01.378
And he can sing.

41:01.461 --> 41:03.463
It's, like, how he talks.

41:04.339 --> 41:06.842
Don't do anything
until I get home tonight.

41:07.551 --> 41:09.803
That's all I'm asking. Please.

41:11.054 --> 41:13.182
-<i>Hey.
</i>-Hey, honey, sorry.

41:13.265 --> 41:14.266
Did you call?

41:16.602 --> 41:17.436
I just...

41:20.147 --> 41:22.149
wanted to wish you a great day.

41:23.609 --> 41:24.443
<i>Thanks.</i>

41:24.526 --> 41:27.487
I could use that.
These city kids have a lot of energy.

41:28.030 --> 41:29.990
I'll see you at home. I love you.

41:32.242 --> 41:33.619
I can't believe I just did that.

41:39.124 --> 41:42.920
Everyone. Yeah, that's nice.
Can we sit down, though, please?

41:43.003 --> 41:45.005
Hey, guys, let's not throw stuff.

41:45.088 --> 41:48.300
Can we just settle down?
Just a little bit, okay?

42:25.671 --> 42:29.591
<i>Just because a record has a groove
Don't make it in the groove</i>

42:29.675 --> 42:30.676
<i>Come on</i>

42:32.511 --> 42:34.221
<i>When the people start to move</i>

42:35.722 --> 42:39.726
<i>They can feel it all over</i>

42:40.310 --> 42:42.896
<i>They can feel it all over</i>

42:42.980 --> 42:45.274
<i>People, yeah</i>

42:46.650 --> 42:48.277
<i>Over</i>

42:51.029 --> 42:51.864
<i>Over</i>

42:51.947 --> 42:52.948
<i>People--</i>

43:11.466 --> 43:14.720
This isn't happening.
Crocodiles don't belong in houses.

43:28.358 --> 43:30.485
<i>When you're cooking something up</i>

43:30.569 --> 43:32.571
<i>And only trying the tried-and-true</i>

43:33.155 --> 43:36.408
<i>You stick to the predictable you've known</i>

43:37.284 --> 43:39.453
<i>Measure out the same amounts</i>

43:39.536 --> 43:41.663
<i>Every teaspoon
Every ounce</i>

43:41.747 --> 43:45.459
<i>No surprises
When the rules are set in stone</i>

43:45.542 --> 43:48.295
<i>But when the sugar hits the fan</i>

43:48.378 --> 43:50.506
<i>You make a mess of your perfect plan</i>

43:50.589 --> 43:54.134
<i>And you're facing the face
Of something strange and new</i>

43:54.218 --> 43:57.221
<i>If it's not what you had prepared</i>

43:57.304 --> 43:59.681
<i>In the scramble
You can't get scared</i>

43:59.765 --> 44:04.144
<i>Let something wild
And wonderful break through</i>

44:04.228 --> 44:07.231
<i>Start ripping up the recipe</i>

44:08.857 --> 44:11.693
<i>Let go of how it has to be</i>

44:13.237 --> 44:17.449
<i>You forget about right and wrong
When you lose yourself in this song</i>

44:17.533 --> 44:20.327
<i>It's perfect unexpectedly</i>

44:20.410 --> 44:21.286
No--

44:21.370 --> 44:22.996
<i>When you rip up the recipe</i>

44:39.471 --> 44:41.765
<i>Living life inside the lines</i>

44:41.849 --> 44:44.351
<i>Safe and simple
By the book</i>

44:44.434 --> 44:47.771
<i>You keep sweeping the uncertainty aside</i>

44:48.480 --> 44:50.399
<i>But an unfamiliar spice</i>

44:50.482 --> 44:52.818
<i>Might bring something extra nice</i>

44:52.901 --> 44:54.570
<i>Something twice as good</i>

44:54.653 --> 44:56.822
<i>As what you would've tried</i>

44:56.905 --> 44:59.366
<i>'Cause when the sugar hits the fan</i>

44:59.449 --> 45:02.077
<i>You make a mess of your perfect plan</i>

45:02.160 --> 45:05.080
<i>And you're facing the face
Of something strange and new</i>

45:05.664 --> 45:08.417
<i>Something's ready to wreck your day</i>

45:08.500 --> 45:10.544
<i>You can pray that it goes away</i>

45:10.627 --> 45:15.382
<i>Or let something wild
And wonderful break through</i>

45:15.465 --> 45:18.468
<i>Start ripping up the recipe</i>

45:19.845 --> 45:22.848
<i>Let go of how it has to be</i>

45:24.016 --> 45:26.268
<i>No, you can't plan it in advance</i>

45:26.351 --> 45:28.729
<i>Gotta lose yourself in the dance</i>

45:28.812 --> 45:31.732
<i>It's perfect unexpectedly</i>

45:32.691 --> 45:33.525
Mom?

45:34.276 --> 45:36.361
<i>When you rip up the recipe</i>

46:02.137 --> 46:05.307
<i>Start ripping up the recipe</i>

46:06.892 --> 46:09.728
<i>And make a little mess with me</i>

46:10.646 --> 46:13.440
<i>You forget about right and wrong</i>

46:13.524 --> 46:15.567
<i>When you lose yourself in this song</i>

46:15.651 --> 46:18.612
<i>It's perfect unexpectedly</i>

46:18.695 --> 46:20.572
<i>When you rip up the recipe</i>

46:27.621 --> 46:29.748
<i>When you rip up the recipe</i>

46:29.831 --> 46:31.792
-Lyle?
-Lyle, all right.

46:35.629 --> 46:38.882
Three cameras,
all mounted on the roof's perimeter.

46:38.966 --> 46:41.802
No one's getting in or out
without you knowing about it.

46:41.885 --> 46:43.887
Perfect. I know they're up to something.

46:44.763 --> 46:48.851
No one's ever putting anything nasty
in Mummy's tummy ever again.

46:48.934 --> 46:50.561
Are they, Mumsykins?

46:50.644 --> 46:52.563
No. No.

46:52.646 --> 46:53.939
N-O.

46:54.690 --> 46:57.484
That's how we spell "no, no, no."

46:57.568 --> 46:58.402
I'm just gonna...

46:59.278 --> 47:00.112
Yeah.

47:14.585 --> 47:15.419
Try that.

47:15.502 --> 47:16.336
Really?

47:17.796 --> 47:19.256
We should save some for Lyle.

47:19.339 --> 47:20.465
Hey, guys.

47:21.258 --> 47:23.468
Good morning, sweetheart.

47:23.552 --> 47:24.386
Hey, Dad.

47:24.469 --> 47:26.471
Pizza. For breakfast.

47:26.555 --> 47:29.266
And where'd you get caviar?

47:30.309 --> 47:31.560
Can I have a--?

47:31.643 --> 47:32.561
-No.
-Sorry.

47:32.644 --> 47:34.813
-Sorry. Excuse me.
-It's more like...

47:42.196 --> 47:44.573
-See you.
-Let's not get any food...

47:49.244 --> 47:50.078
Honey?

47:51.455 --> 47:52.289
Yeah?

47:52.372 --> 47:55.083
I've noticed that you've been...

47:57.461 --> 47:59.338
happy recently.

48:00.047 --> 48:01.882
Which is great.

48:01.965 --> 48:04.384
And I wondered if that,

48:04.468 --> 48:08.055
you know, hasn't been because of me.

48:08.889 --> 48:10.224
I mean, is...?

48:11.600 --> 48:14.019
Is there something I need to know?

48:14.102 --> 48:15.437
Oh, sweet pea.

48:15.521 --> 48:16.688
I mean, is there...

48:18.106 --> 48:19.441
someone else?

48:21.777 --> 48:23.779
Not exactly.

48:28.659 --> 48:30.619
It's time to tell your father.

48:30.702 --> 48:31.870
Tell me what?

48:39.753 --> 48:42.172
-Go, go, go...
-Hey, Dad, wait, it's fine.

48:42.256 --> 48:43.507
It's not what you think.

48:43.590 --> 48:45.217
All right, this way.

48:45.300 --> 48:46.301
Hide in here.

48:46.385 --> 48:47.553
Dad, it's okay.

48:47.636 --> 48:48.637
It is not okay.

48:48.720 --> 48:50.973
There's a crocodile in the house.

48:51.056 --> 48:54.101
That's what I thought too,
but he's not a normal crocodile.

48:54.184 --> 48:55.811
What are you talking about?

48:56.353 --> 48:57.980
Everybody, get out of here!

49:19.293 --> 49:21.461
Follow me! Let's go!

49:26.884 --> 49:28.510
There's a crocodile...

49:28.594 --> 49:29.970
May I wish you good day, sir.

49:31.221 --> 49:33.724
-Hector P. Valenti, at your service.
-What?

49:33.807 --> 49:35.559
Where should I put my bags?

49:36.143 --> 49:37.394
I'm not sure I--

49:37.477 --> 49:39.479
Oh, dear. You didn't know I was coming?

49:40.063 --> 49:40.898
No worries.

49:40.981 --> 49:44.693
While you call the school authorities,
I'll make myself at home.

49:46.695 --> 49:48.989
But you're... I'm...

49:49.072 --> 49:50.782
Please, please, be my guest.

49:50.866 --> 49:53.327
It's been a very long and difficult trip.

49:53.410 --> 49:55.287
I'd hate to put my back out
in a moment of--

49:55.370 --> 49:56.455
Oh, my.

49:57.247 --> 49:59.124
Oh, Lyle.

49:59.208 --> 50:01.835
Look at the size of you.

50:07.799 --> 50:08.634
Lyle.

50:26.985 --> 50:27.819
Yes.

50:58.517 --> 51:00.352
I missed you too.

51:02.312 --> 51:03.146
Lyle.

51:04.940 --> 51:08.360
Oh, no, no, no.
We had no idea. Nobody told us anything.

51:11.405 --> 51:12.239
Yeah.

51:14.032 --> 51:15.367
Okay, yeah.

51:15.450 --> 51:18.328
Well, thank you. Thank you very much. Bye.

51:18.412 --> 51:19.788
What did they say?

51:19.872 --> 51:22.207
Well, this was his family's brownstone,

51:22.291 --> 51:25.502
but he somehow lost it
in some kind of a business deal.

51:26.086 --> 51:28.797
He's figuring out some kind of new show,

51:28.881 --> 51:34.219
and there's a clause that says somehow
he can stay here 15 days out of the year.

51:34.303 --> 51:35.137
What?

51:37.306 --> 51:38.682
This cannot be happening.

51:39.683 --> 51:43.478
We have a crocodile, and now
David Copperfield, living in our attic.

51:44.646 --> 51:46.607
This is definitely not okay.

51:47.566 --> 51:50.194
And can you please stop drawing him?

51:52.070 --> 51:53.697
It's weird.

52:01.163 --> 52:02.164
Yes.

52:02.831 --> 52:03.832
Yes.

52:31.360 --> 52:32.361
I hate you.

52:35.155 --> 52:36.782
I hate them so much.

52:50.087 --> 52:51.964
<i>Express yourself</i>

52:55.425 --> 52:56.969
<i>Express yourself</i>

52:59.304 --> 53:01.223
Good morning, sir. Good morning.

53:01.306 --> 53:03.559
If there's any breakfast, I'll take eggs.

53:04.101 --> 53:07.145
Any way you wanna make them.
But not scrambled. Or fried.

53:07.229 --> 53:08.063
Thank you.

53:10.983 --> 53:12.776
<i>Whatever you do</i>

53:16.405 --> 53:18.031
<i>Do it good</i>

53:21.451 --> 53:22.911
<i>Whatever you do</i>

53:22.995 --> 53:25.372
<i>Do, do, do, do, yeah</i>

53:26.748 --> 53:28.500
<i>Express yourself</i>

53:29.376 --> 53:30.794
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

53:31.962 --> 53:33.463
<i>Oh, do it</i>

53:34.548 --> 53:36.008
<i>Oh, do it</i>

53:37.176 --> 53:39.469
<i>Do it to it, yeah</i>

53:41.346 --> 53:44.266
<i>Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah</i>

53:47.269 --> 53:50.272
Okay, family day.
What do you think, history museum?

53:50.856 --> 53:52.274
-Go there?
-Sure.

53:52.357 --> 53:54.234
There he is.

53:54.818 --> 53:55.819
I'm just gonna...

53:58.530 --> 54:01.158
So, Dad's not coming.

54:01.241 --> 54:03.368
Dad needs to let off a little steam.

54:04.620 --> 54:06.330
He doesn't like Hector, does he?

54:06.872 --> 54:12.336
Oh, well,
Hector is a very colorful character.

54:12.419 --> 54:16.006
I don't know about you, but I could
eat a horse if you spread butter on it.

54:16.089 --> 54:18.592
-You're a Gators fan?
-Don't be ridiculous.

54:18.675 --> 54:21.970
Smoke and mirrors, my friend.
Smoke and mirrors.

54:22.054 --> 54:24.848
How else do you think Lyle can join us?

54:30.812 --> 54:32.022
Shall we?

54:33.565 --> 54:36.568
-Are you sure this is safe?
-Who wants to be safe?

54:36.652 --> 54:40.447
No, "safe" is a repellent little word.
Expunge it from your mind.

54:40.531 --> 54:42.324
We are here to live, yes?

54:42.407 --> 54:44.493
And living is a dangerous business.

54:44.576 --> 54:48.872
You're not worried that some people
might think he's a real crocodile?

54:48.956 --> 54:52.584
Nothing could be of less importance
than what other people think.

54:52.668 --> 54:54.002
Let people stare.

54:54.086 --> 54:57.881
For once in their dreary lives,
they have something wonderful to look at.

54:57.965 --> 54:59.675
Look, look.

55:03.220 --> 55:04.221
Here it is.

55:08.684 --> 55:10.352
-Brain freeze.
-Another one.

55:19.361 --> 55:21.029
Oh, no, you're going down!

55:21.113 --> 55:23.323
-You're going down!
-Yeah!

55:25.075 --> 55:26.660
-Let's go, Dawgs!
-What the...?

56:04.781 --> 56:07.826
Oh, perfect timing.
You could be on my team.

56:07.910 --> 56:09.870
-Hey.
-Oh, I'm okay.

56:09.953 --> 56:13.040
I'm exhausted.
I'll go upstairs and take a shower.

56:13.123 --> 56:15.751
Hector thinks the hot water might be out.

56:15.834 --> 56:17.085
My bad.

56:18.754 --> 56:20.881
Okay, right hand, red.

56:48.492 --> 56:49.326
Lyle.

56:51.245 --> 56:54.331
I was just checking the boiler.

56:54.414 --> 56:57.543
Because it's cold, right?

57:03.507 --> 57:04.925
Where'd you get that at?

57:05.634 --> 57:08.470
Lyle, why would you do that?

57:42.629 --> 57:43.964
Oh, no.

57:44.047 --> 57:45.090
Not today.

58:03.400 --> 58:06.361
One, two, three.

58:06.445 --> 58:07.863
Yeah!

58:11.575 --> 58:13.285
All-league champion!

58:13.368 --> 58:15.746
I'm back, I'm back!

58:15.829 --> 58:17.247
I still got it.

58:17.331 --> 58:20.000
Twenty years. State champs, '99.

58:25.589 --> 58:27.549
Come on, one more round.

58:35.474 --> 58:36.308
Stay down.

58:48.529 --> 58:49.446
Good morning.

58:56.161 --> 58:57.913
Let's try that again.

58:57.996 --> 59:00.832
Good morning, Mr. Primm.

59:05.629 --> 59:07.297
Dad, you have to come see this.

59:07.381 --> 59:09.883
-Is that a white rabbit?
-We can start the show of magic.

59:09.967 --> 59:11.718
Can you please pass me those?

59:12.261 --> 59:14.388
-This?
-Thank you. Yes, I need those.

59:14.471 --> 59:15.681
Thank you very much.

59:16.306 --> 59:20.060
Now, now that we have the bunny,
we can start our magic show.

59:21.019 --> 59:22.855
Front row for you, sir.

59:24.189 --> 59:27.401
Behold, the power of illusion.

59:27.484 --> 59:29.862
Okay? Nothing here, nothing over there.

59:29.945 --> 59:32.239
Follow the card carefully.

59:36.743 --> 59:38.203
Magical magic.

59:47.754 --> 59:49.298
Where are they? Here they are.

59:51.175 --> 59:53.427
You have a nine, and you have a two.

1:00:02.019 --> 1:00:04.271
Thank you. Thank you very much.

1:00:05.772 --> 1:00:07.900
Hey, play us one of your songs.

1:00:07.983 --> 1:00:11.153
-Yeah, play something.
-That would be amazing. Please?

1:00:26.460 --> 1:00:30.005
<i>Maybe we started pretty small</i>

1:00:31.882 --> 1:00:33.884
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1:00:37.930 --> 1:00:41.350
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1:00:42.184 --> 1:00:45.270
<i>Suddenly standing 10 feet tall</i>

1:00:45.354 --> 1:00:46.772
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1:00:46.855 --> 1:00:49.107
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1:00:49.191 --> 1:00:51.818
<i>Though we had no way to stay afloat</i>

1:00:51.902 --> 1:00:55.489
<i>We were scared
They'd say it was all she wrote</i>

1:00:55.572 --> 1:00:58.742
<i>We're ending on a sky-high note</i>

1:00:58.825 --> 1:01:01.161
<i>Somehow</i>

1:01:01.245 --> 1:01:03.830
<i>Buddy, you were all it took</i>

1:01:04.790 --> 1:01:08.919
<i>So take a look at us now</i>

1:01:17.928 --> 1:01:20.389
Don't you see what that means, Lyle?

1:01:20.472 --> 1:01:23.058
That was an audience,

1:01:23.141 --> 1:01:25.018
and you performed.

1:01:26.562 --> 1:01:28.814
You performed, Lyle.

1:01:28.897 --> 1:01:30.524
Yes.

1:01:32.484 --> 1:01:33.819
Lyle. Lyle?

1:01:34.736 --> 1:01:35.821
We can do it.

1:01:37.030 --> 1:01:39.950
We can do it.
We can take our show on the road.

1:01:40.033 --> 1:01:42.160
You and me, like we always planned.

1:01:48.375 --> 1:01:50.335
<i>So I made a couple mistakes</i>

1:01:50.419 --> 1:01:52.462
<i>Got a few things wrong</i>

1:01:52.546 --> 1:01:54.256
<i>We can claw right back</i>

1:01:54.339 --> 1:01:56.592
<i>To where we belong</i>

1:01:56.675 --> 1:01:58.552
<i>It's just us two</i>

1:01:58.635 --> 1:02:01.638
<i>And a soaring song</i>

1:02:01.722 --> 1:02:04.683
<i>Redoing our debut</i>

1:02:05.642 --> 1:02:09.062
<i>We get to finish what we started</i>

1:02:09.146 --> 1:02:11.607
<i>It's a brand-new me and you</i>

1:02:12.149 --> 1:02:14.943
<i>A brand-new me and you</i>

1:02:15.027 --> 1:02:16.612
<i>Thought we might be sunk</i>

1:02:16.695 --> 1:02:18.322
<i>Upon first glance</i>

1:02:18.405 --> 1:02:21.158
<i>Well, who'd have thunk?
Here's a second chance</i>

1:02:21.241 --> 1:02:26.205
<i>And life could be
A song and dance somehow</i>

1:02:26.288 --> 1:02:29.166
<i>So take a look at us now</i>

1:02:30.667 --> 1:02:32.127
Let's go. Let's go.

1:02:36.965 --> 1:02:39.426
Where are you going?
Why is he all dressed up?

1:02:39.510 --> 1:02:43.138
When the world sees
Lyle sing and dance, we're gonna be rich.

1:02:43.222 --> 1:02:44.306
-Rich.
-What?

1:02:44.389 --> 1:02:48.352
But he doesn't need money.
He needs a family and a home.

1:02:48.435 --> 1:02:50.854
This is the business of show, Josh.

1:02:50.938 --> 1:02:53.398
Because Lyle is not just a crocodile.

1:02:53.482 --> 1:02:54.483
He's a showman.

1:02:55.317 --> 1:02:56.276
Bye.

1:02:56.944 --> 1:02:58.529
Does he even want that?

1:02:58.612 --> 1:03:00.447
Josh, tonight is our big night.

1:03:00.531 --> 1:03:01.698
The night for what?

1:03:02.282 --> 1:03:05.494
The preview
for potential investors in our new show.

1:03:06.078 --> 1:03:08.914
Evangelyne will get us there just in time.

1:03:08.997 --> 1:03:10.499
Who's Evangelyne?

1:03:13.377 --> 1:03:14.461
Hector?

1:03:21.260 --> 1:03:22.094
Wish us luck.

1:03:24.763 --> 1:03:27.391
Take a look at us now.

1:03:51.874 --> 1:03:54.376
Hey, how'd it go?

1:03:55.419 --> 1:03:57.504
The stage can be a cruel mistress.

1:03:58.297 --> 1:04:01.175
I thought Lyle had changed, but he hasn't.

1:04:01.717 --> 1:04:02.551
He froze.

1:04:03.760 --> 1:04:04.720
Stage fright.

1:04:06.180 --> 1:04:08.599
He still won't sing for an audience.

1:04:33.999 --> 1:04:35.083
Just so you know,

1:04:35.709 --> 1:04:38.629
I don't care if you sing or not.

1:04:39.254 --> 1:04:41.340
Either way, I think you're awesome.

1:04:56.772 --> 1:04:59.024
Just give him a little time, okay?

1:04:59.816 --> 1:05:00.943
He's gonna be okay.

1:05:11.411 --> 1:05:15.499
<i>Thought we would make a perfect pair</i>

1:05:15.582 --> 1:05:17.876
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1:05:19.169 --> 1:05:23.632
<i>Thought there was a spotlight
We could share</i>

1:05:23.715 --> 1:05:26.844
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1:05:26.927 --> 1:05:31.640
I won't pretend this
isn't something of a blow, my old friend.

1:05:32.808 --> 1:05:36.186
One or two loans will now require

1:05:37.020 --> 1:05:39.940
a radical renegotiation, you know?

1:05:40.023 --> 1:05:44.820
But nothing I can't smooth over
with a little Valenti charm.

1:05:55.747 --> 1:05:59.209
<i>Take a look at us</i>

1:06:00.294 --> 1:06:02.921
<i>Now</i>

1:06:11.221 --> 1:06:13.682
It's the school's brownstone, not yours.

1:06:13.765 --> 1:06:16.476
I'm done. I did not sign up for this.

1:06:18.395 --> 1:06:20.022
Mr. Primm, for you.

1:06:20.981 --> 1:06:23.192
Oh, good, it's the man of the hour.

1:06:23.275 --> 1:06:26.528
You're a member of the neighborhood?
Time to earn your spot.

1:06:26.612 --> 1:06:28.447
Okay, great.

1:06:34.036 --> 1:06:35.537
Get the money.

1:06:43.629 --> 1:06:44.630
Show business.

1:06:53.472 --> 1:06:54.932
Oh, please, sit.

1:06:55.891 --> 1:06:56.892
Come in.

1:06:58.977 --> 1:07:01.855
I don't wanna be unneighborly.

1:07:01.939 --> 1:07:02.898
Really, I don't.

1:07:02.981 --> 1:07:08.487
And no one loves music and singing
and dancing more than me, you know.

1:07:09.238 --> 1:07:10.948
Just not at 3:00 in the morning.

1:07:11.031 --> 1:07:13.742
So if you could find it in your hearts

1:07:13.825 --> 1:07:15.494
to sign the petition,

1:07:15.577 --> 1:07:19.289
and override the school's power
to allow awful families like this...

1:07:19.373 --> 1:07:21.625
-Okay, now hold on just a second--
-No.

1:07:22.417 --> 1:07:24.211
-Well...
-That's just Josh.

1:07:24.294 --> 1:07:25.838
-Practicing wrestling.
-Trampoline.

1:07:25.921 --> 1:07:27.089
On a trampoline.

1:07:27.172 --> 1:07:29.258
He wrestles on a trampoline
that we'll get rid of.

1:07:29.341 --> 1:07:32.344
Sure, but if it's not that,
and it's something else,

1:07:32.427 --> 1:07:34.721
something that you're hiding from us,

1:07:34.805 --> 1:07:37.558
something that
you think you'll get in trouble for,

1:07:37.641 --> 1:07:40.227
well, I believe
now is the time to share it.

1:07:42.437 --> 1:07:43.856
Do you mind if I join you?

1:07:44.439 --> 1:07:46.233
-Valenti.
-Alistair Grumps.

1:07:46.316 --> 1:07:47.818
Alistair Grumps.

1:07:48.360 --> 1:07:49.862
How in the world are you?

1:07:54.449 --> 1:07:55.909
Is that the same sofa?

1:07:55.993 --> 1:07:58.328
You literally have not changed a thing.

1:07:59.496 --> 1:08:02.791
You see, Alistair and I grew up together.

1:08:02.875 --> 1:08:05.502
-Have you been drinking?
-Yes, I have.

1:08:05.586 --> 1:08:08.755
I always feel like the world
looks better with a glass of champagne.

1:08:08.839 --> 1:08:10.465
A glass of champagne.

1:08:10.549 --> 1:08:12.217
Get out. This is none of your business.

1:08:12.301 --> 1:08:15.304
It is, it is,
because if the Primms are the problem,

1:08:15.387 --> 1:08:19.683
then I, as their houseguest,
I'm part of the problem too, am I not?

1:08:19.765 --> 1:08:20.600
A large part.

1:08:20.684 --> 1:08:24.188
With your permission, I'd like
to be part of the solution as well.

1:08:24.270 --> 1:08:25.647
Would you mind, please?

1:08:25.731 --> 1:08:26.773
Thank you.

1:08:28.108 --> 1:08:30.986
-Delicious.
-Per usual, Hector, you're overstepping.

1:08:31.069 --> 1:08:33.863
We are not the only ones
who overstepped the mark.

1:08:33.947 --> 1:08:37.033
We, for instance,
haven't mounted security cameras

1:08:37.117 --> 1:08:38.911
throughout the neighborhood,

1:08:38.993 --> 1:08:41.662
filming other residents
without their consent.

1:08:49.421 --> 1:08:50.546
No permission asked?

1:08:50.631 --> 1:08:51.631
None.

1:08:51.715 --> 1:08:53.759
-No.
-No. Were releases signed?

1:08:53.841 --> 1:08:55.051
-No.
-No.

1:08:55.135 --> 1:08:58.889
Well, if it was me,
I'd go straight to the police.

1:09:03.060 --> 1:09:04.019
Out, all of you.

1:09:04.102 --> 1:09:05.645
Everyone, get out of here.

1:09:06.939 --> 1:09:07.773
Come on.

1:09:08.314 --> 1:09:10.317
This meeting
will be reconvened at a later date.

1:09:10.399 --> 1:09:12.109
Thank you so much for coming.

1:09:12.819 --> 1:09:13.654
Excuse me.

1:09:15.154 --> 1:09:16.073
Not you.

1:09:17.658 --> 1:09:21.745
I can assure you, Alistair,
we have absolutely nothing to talk about.

1:09:24.331 --> 1:09:25.666
Why don't we see about that?

1:09:29.002 --> 1:09:31.921
-Hector had this whole performance.
-Even Marjory was miffed.

1:09:32.005 --> 1:09:34.131
-Mr. Grumps's jaw was...
-She was so upset.

1:09:34.216 --> 1:09:35.384
-Hector.
-Hector.

1:09:35.466 --> 1:09:37.219
Oh, thank you.

1:09:38.011 --> 1:09:40.389
-Thank you so much.
-That was incredible.

1:09:40.471 --> 1:09:43.015
No, no, no.
You have all been extraordinary.

1:09:43.100 --> 1:09:44.977
It was the least I could do.

1:09:45.060 --> 1:09:46.185
Thank you, really.

1:09:46.270 --> 1:09:49.189
So I have to make myself presentable.

1:09:49.814 --> 1:09:52.734
I'll be back
in two shakes of a lamb's tail, okay?

1:10:09.835 --> 1:10:10.669
Hide him.

1:10:11.920 --> 1:10:12.754
Now.

1:10:13.297 --> 1:10:14.131
Go.

1:10:20.095 --> 1:10:21.096
Stay here.

1:10:24.308 --> 1:10:25.934
Hector, Hector.

1:10:28.979 --> 1:10:30.230
Where is he?

1:10:30.814 --> 1:10:34.359
I'm gonna look around back.
Just in case. Could be a big one.

1:10:35.652 --> 1:10:37.321
Stay back, stay back.

1:10:38.906 --> 1:10:40.908
-No, no.
-Josh.

1:10:40.991 --> 1:10:42.409
He won't hurt you.

1:10:45.245 --> 1:10:46.413
Lyle.

1:10:49.625 --> 1:10:51.001
You have to sing.

1:10:54.087 --> 1:10:55.130
Now.

1:10:56.673 --> 1:10:57.799
No.

1:10:57.883 --> 1:10:58.717
No.

1:11:10.270 --> 1:11:12.856
-Watch your step there.
-Easy.

1:11:13.732 --> 1:11:14.566
No.

1:11:20.072 --> 1:11:21.114
You're clear.

1:11:33.210 --> 1:11:35.337
-Josh.
-I'll talk to him.

1:11:35.420 --> 1:11:36.380
I knew it.

1:11:36.463 --> 1:11:38.799
I knew you were up to no good.

1:11:38.882 --> 1:11:41.802
Hiding a crocodile.
You've broken so many rules.

1:11:41.885 --> 1:11:44.930
Wait till I tell your school.
They'll throw you out of the city.

1:11:45.013 --> 1:11:48.183
You'll be gone,
all of you, by Thanksgiving.

1:12:37.024 --> 1:12:38.192
Lyle.

1:12:38.275 --> 1:12:40.194
Hey, hey, buddy.

1:12:40.277 --> 1:12:41.570
Hey, are you okay?

1:12:42.821 --> 1:12:44.698
I came as soon as it opened.

1:12:44.781 --> 1:12:46.575
-Lyle.
-Hey, buddy.

1:12:54.082 --> 1:12:55.918
Hey, no hands through the bars.

1:12:56.001 --> 1:12:57.169
Thank you.

1:12:57.252 --> 1:12:58.545
You, get back.

1:13:08.931 --> 1:13:11.266
We have to do something.
He must hate it here.

1:13:11.350 --> 1:13:15.354
Look, Josh, they understand crocodiles.
They're gonna look after him.

1:13:15.437 --> 1:13:18.065
Then why aren't they giving him
pork-and-rosemary vol-au-vents,

1:13:18.148 --> 1:13:20.859
or chicken Milanese
with a dash of salsa verde?

1:13:20.943 --> 1:13:22.653
He's a crocodile, sweetheart.

1:13:22.736 --> 1:13:25.864
He's a very special crocodile,
but he is still a crocodile.

1:13:25.948 --> 1:13:28.867
He has to learn
to live with the other crocodiles.

1:13:28.951 --> 1:13:31.078
-No, no. We can break him out.
-Josh.

1:13:31.161 --> 1:13:33.455
It's not a bank.
It's a zoo. How hard can it be?

1:13:33.539 --> 1:13:34.748
Josh, stop.

1:13:34.831 --> 1:13:38.085
Okay? We'll come visit Lyle
every day, I promise.

1:13:38.168 --> 1:13:42.005
We'll speak to the zoo, and ask them
to let us bring Lyle his favorite treats.

1:13:42.089 --> 1:13:43.924
There's only so much we can do.

1:13:45.008 --> 1:13:47.469
Not all problems have a solution, Josh.

1:13:49.638 --> 1:13:51.974
No, you don't get to decide that.

1:13:52.057 --> 1:13:53.767
Not for me. Not anymore.

1:13:54.685 --> 1:13:57.020
My whole life, I've been scared,

1:13:57.104 --> 1:13:58.730
because you've been scared.

1:13:59.273 --> 1:14:01.525
But I'm not scared anymore.

1:14:01.608 --> 1:14:03.068
Because of Lyle.

1:14:04.111 --> 1:14:06.280
He changed everything for me.

1:14:06.363 --> 1:14:07.698
And not just for me.

1:14:07.781 --> 1:14:09.116
For you too. So...

1:14:10.242 --> 1:14:11.785
I'm not gonna leave here.

1:14:12.327 --> 1:14:14.913
I'm not just gonna leave here without...

1:14:14.997 --> 1:14:16.707
-Leave here without...
-Josh?

1:14:17.624 --> 1:14:20.460
-Wait, Josh, Josh, Josh.
-Oh, my God.

1:14:20.544 --> 1:14:22.504
Josh, are you okay?

1:14:22.588 --> 1:14:25.132
-Josh. Get his inhaler.
-It's in his jacket.

1:14:25.215 --> 1:14:26.258
Call 911.

1:14:31.930 --> 1:14:34.224
He had a panic attack
that triggered his asthma.

1:14:34.308 --> 1:14:36.059
It's good he had his inhaler.

1:14:36.143 --> 1:14:39.104
He's gonna be fine.
You got nothing to worry about.

1:14:39.188 --> 1:14:40.105
Thank you, sir.

1:14:43.942 --> 1:14:45.319
-You okay, bud?
-Yeah.

1:14:45.402 --> 1:14:46.820
-You sure?
-Yeah.

1:15:01.960 --> 1:15:05.506
<i>We had nights of endless music</i>

1:15:07.382 --> 1:15:11.887
<i>We were dizzy dancing till the dawn</i>

1:15:13.472 --> 1:15:18.060
<i>We were free
Singing sweet harmonies with the city</i>

1:15:20.062 --> 1:15:23.774
<i>But maybe that was someone else's song</i>

1:15:26.443 --> 1:15:28.487
<i>Back to earth again</i>

1:15:28.570 --> 1:15:32.533
<i>You knew where this was headed
And honestly you're better off</i>

1:15:32.616 --> 1:15:36.203
<i>Better here where you belong</i>

1:15:36.995 --> 1:15:40.374
<i>You got caught up in the colors</i>

1:15:40.457 --> 1:15:43.085
<i>You got wrapped up in the ride</i>

1:15:43.168 --> 1:15:46.463
<i>You thought the feeling was forever</i>

1:15:46.547 --> 1:15:49.424
<i>And the stars were on your side</i>

1:15:49.508 --> 1:15:52.761
<i>It was lovely while it lasted</i>

1:15:52.845 --> 1:15:55.556
<i>But it wasn't meant to stay</i>

1:15:55.639 --> 1:16:00.477
<i>Still you let yourself get carried away</i>

1:16:01.812 --> 1:16:07.025
<i>I guess I let myself get carried away</i>

1:16:07.818 --> 1:16:11.321
<i>We got carried away</i>

1:16:11.405 --> 1:16:14.074
<i>Carried away</i>

1:16:14.157 --> 1:16:17.494
<i>Got carried away</i>

1:16:17.578 --> 1:16:19.288
<i>Carried away</i>

1:16:21.999 --> 1:16:26.003
<i>So we got mixed up in the madness</i>

1:16:28.130 --> 1:16:31.633
<i>But wasn't it a perfect mess we made?</i>

1:16:32.926 --> 1:16:34.720
<i>Well, you live and you learn</i>

1:16:34.803 --> 1:16:38.182
<i>You return
To the safe and the simple</i>

1:16:39.016 --> 1:16:44.062
<i>And behind our walls
We fall back into place</i>

1:16:46.857 --> 1:16:48.400
<i>Back to earth again</i>

1:16:48.483 --> 1:16:52.696
<i>You're through with pretending
'Cause this is how the ending goes</i>

1:16:52.779 --> 1:16:56.617
<i>Now you're here where you belong</i>

1:16:57.576 --> 1:17:00.871
<i>We got caught up in the colors</i>

1:17:00.954 --> 1:17:03.665
<i>We got wrapped up in the ride</i>

1:17:03.749 --> 1:17:07.085
<i>We thought the feeling was forever</i>

1:17:07.169 --> 1:17:10.255
<i>And the stars were on our side</i>

1:17:10.339 --> 1:17:13.342
<i>It was lovely while it lasted</i>

1:17:13.425 --> 1:17:16.053
<i>But it wasn't meant to stay</i>

1:17:16.136 --> 1:17:20.933
<i>We just let ourselves get carried away</i>

1:17:21.725 --> 1:17:24.937
<i>We got carried away</i>

1:17:25.020 --> 1:17:28.023
<i>Carried away</i>

1:17:28.106 --> 1:17:31.443
<i>Got carried away</i>

1:17:31.527 --> 1:17:34.279
<i>Carried away</i>

1:17:34.363 --> 1:17:36.073
<i>Carried away</i>

1:17:36.156 --> 1:17:38.242
<i>Lost in a fantasy</i>

1:17:38.951 --> 1:17:40.786
<i>Of all we were gonna be</i>

1:17:40.869 --> 1:17:43.747
<i>Carried away</i>

1:17:43.830 --> 1:17:46.083
<i>Carried away</i>

1:17:50.587 --> 1:17:53.674
<i>It was lovely while it lasted</i>

1:17:53.757 --> 1:17:56.301
<i>It was never meant to stay</i>

1:17:58.387 --> 1:18:03.684
<i>But we let ourselves get carried away</i>

1:18:05.269 --> 1:18:11.358
<i>I guess I let myself get carried away</i>

1:18:35.299 --> 1:18:36.300
Hey.

1:18:38.844 --> 1:18:39.845
Can you believe it?

1:18:40.387 --> 1:18:43.473
I still can't believe it.
We're gonna be on <i>Show Us What You Got</i>.

1:18:44.558 --> 1:18:45.392
That's great.

1:18:46.268 --> 1:18:47.519
You deserve it.

1:18:49.730 --> 1:18:50.564
Listen.

1:18:51.523 --> 1:18:52.357
Don't give up.

1:18:53.317 --> 1:18:56.528
When Malfoy escaped, I thought
I'd never see him again either.

1:18:58.322 --> 1:19:01.658
Malfoy? The pet rattlesnake
my crazy Uncle Ernie gave me?

1:19:01.742 --> 1:19:05.287
He was gone for six weeks.
We all thought he was dead.

1:19:05.370 --> 1:19:08.665
Until the neighbors found him
in the back of their toaster oven.

1:19:11.960 --> 1:19:13.754
Miracles do happen, Josh.

1:19:29.353 --> 1:19:30.354
There he goes.

1:19:41.406 --> 1:19:42.824
Mom, I'm fine.

1:19:42.908 --> 1:19:45.619
I know you're fine.
I'm gonna make sure you stay that way.

1:19:45.702 --> 1:19:46.703
Come on.

1:20:03.345 --> 1:20:04.555
Where you going?

1:20:05.347 --> 1:20:07.015
-Taking the trash out.
-Okay.

1:20:07.099 --> 1:20:08.684
-Be careful.
-Be careful.

1:20:31.540 --> 1:20:32.875
How could you do it?

1:20:32.958 --> 1:20:36.211
I've asked myself
the same question over and over, Josh.

1:20:37.838 --> 1:20:40.174
But, you see, I've got nothing.

1:20:41.300 --> 1:20:43.010
No family, no friends.

1:20:43.093 --> 1:20:44.595
Then why do you keep leaving him?

1:20:44.678 --> 1:20:45.929
When Lyle choked,

1:20:46.013 --> 1:20:49.224
I had to go back and make it on my own.

1:20:50.058 --> 1:20:51.977
Again. Yes.

1:20:52.060 --> 1:20:55.230
But I couldn't,
because no one's interested in...

1:20:56.899 --> 1:20:57.733
me.

1:20:58.483 --> 1:21:00.777
And I owe a lot of people a lot of money.

1:21:00.861 --> 1:21:01.987
A lot of money.

1:21:02.070 --> 1:21:05.741
So when Alistair Grumps offered me
that cash, I had to take it.

1:21:05.824 --> 1:21:08.785
Out of need, out of fear, out of weakness.

1:21:10.829 --> 1:21:13.081
And I've hated myself for doing it.

1:21:13.165 --> 1:21:15.417
Good, because I hate you too.

1:21:15.501 --> 1:21:19.129
But this is not about me, or about you.
It's about Lyle.

1:21:20.339 --> 1:21:23.383
You know as well as I do,
we can't leave him in that zoo.

1:21:23.467 --> 1:21:25.677
So if you have the stomach for it,

1:21:25.761 --> 1:21:29.431
if you have the fire in your belly
I know you have,

1:21:29.515 --> 1:21:30.891
you have,

1:21:30.974 --> 1:21:34.436
you, young man, are going to help me
break that crocodile out of the zoo.

1:21:34.520 --> 1:21:39.191
Yes, because we have magic on our side.

1:21:39.274 --> 1:21:40.651
The power of illusion.

1:21:41.735 --> 1:21:43.195
Magical magic.

1:21:44.780 --> 1:21:46.949
There is no magic, Hector.

1:21:52.621 --> 1:21:54.998
I'll be at the East Gate at 4 a.m.

1:21:55.082 --> 1:21:56.708
Four a.m. Be there.

1:22:50.053 --> 1:22:53.390
<i>Join us live tomorrow,
right here in New York City.</i>

1:22:53.473 --> 1:22:58.395
<i>We're crowning the world's next superstar
on the finale of </i>Show Us What You Got<i>.</i>

1:23:00.606 --> 1:23:02.482
<i>Oh, no...</i>

1:23:10.657 --> 1:23:12.659
-What do we got here?
-My dear fellow.

1:23:12.743 --> 1:23:14.828
May I have some assistance, please?

1:23:15.746 --> 1:23:20.542
I thought I had this trick down,
but I've got myself in a bit of a pickle.

1:23:20.626 --> 1:23:21.460
Please.

1:23:23.337 --> 1:23:26.465
-Okay. Some sort of handcuff trick?
-Thank you.

1:23:26.548 --> 1:23:29.259
This looks crazy.
Maybe if you move that way...

1:23:29.801 --> 1:23:30.636
Hey.

1:23:31.428 --> 1:23:32.262
Hey, hey.

1:23:33.180 --> 1:23:34.223
Magical magic.

1:23:34.932 --> 1:23:36.141
Let me out of here.

1:23:36.225 --> 1:23:37.809
This won't take long. I promise.

1:23:37.893 --> 1:23:40.729
No, you can't go in there.
You can't go in there.

1:23:40.812 --> 1:23:42.481
Come back here. Come back here.

1:23:52.950 --> 1:23:53.867
Lyle.

1:23:58.413 --> 1:23:59.498
Lyle.

1:24:03.252 --> 1:24:04.086
Not Lyle.

1:24:04.169 --> 1:24:06.004
Not Lyle.

1:24:10.384 --> 1:24:11.635
Not good.

1:24:12.177 --> 1:24:13.929
This was seriously your plan?

1:24:14.513 --> 1:24:16.348
I knew you'd come.

1:24:17.057 --> 1:24:19.768
Yes. Climb up there,
and catch my rope, please.

1:24:19.852 --> 1:24:21.687
You have to get me out of here.

1:24:21.770 --> 1:24:22.604
Josh?

1:24:23.981 --> 1:24:25.399
-Come on. Josh.
-Lyle.

1:24:27.943 --> 1:24:28.777
Lyle.

1:24:29.361 --> 1:24:30.362
Lyle.

1:24:31.697 --> 1:24:33.782
Help me. Help me.

1:24:37.327 --> 1:24:38.161
Lyle.

1:24:40.247 --> 1:24:41.248
No, no, no.

1:24:41.331 --> 1:24:42.249
Josh?

1:24:42.833 --> 1:24:45.711
You have to talk to him.
Tell him to help me.

1:24:45.794 --> 1:24:48.255
It's not me
that has to talk to him, Hector.

1:24:49.006 --> 1:24:50.048
It's you.

1:24:50.632 --> 1:24:51.466
But...

1:24:54.845 --> 1:24:59.850
I realize I may not have always acted
in the best way possible, Lyle.

1:24:59.933 --> 1:25:02.978
But I showed you the world.

1:25:03.061 --> 1:25:05.355
I introduced you to white truffle oil.

1:25:05.439 --> 1:25:06.982
I taught you the moonwalk.

1:25:08.066 --> 1:25:09.067
Okay, fine, fine.

1:25:09.151 --> 1:25:12.237
I apologize. My behavior was unforgivable.

1:25:12.321 --> 1:25:14.781
I used you, and I abandoned you.

1:25:16.408 --> 1:25:18.202
And it's my fault you're here.

1:25:18.285 --> 1:25:20.162
But, please, come back with me.

1:25:20.245 --> 1:25:22.039
Come back to where you belong.

1:25:23.290 --> 1:25:24.124
Back to...

1:25:32.883 --> 1:25:33.800
Back to Josh.

1:25:38.805 --> 1:25:39.806
And the Primms.

1:25:42.518 --> 1:25:43.519
To your family.

1:25:58.784 --> 1:26:00.702
We gotta get you out of here.

1:26:05.916 --> 1:26:08.126
Tell me the second part
of your plan is better.

1:26:08.210 --> 1:26:09.711
Not better. It's perfect.

1:26:09.795 --> 1:26:12.589
I've got Evangelyne
parked up by the gates.

1:26:12.673 --> 1:26:14.508
We can outrun anyone on her.

1:26:14.591 --> 1:26:16.552
But Lyle can't just keep running.

1:26:16.635 --> 1:26:19.763
Of course he can.
You'd be amazed what you can outrun.

1:26:19.847 --> 1:26:21.348
-Ex-wives.
-Hands up.

1:26:21.431 --> 1:26:22.766
Creditors.

1:26:24.643 --> 1:26:25.936
Park rangers.

1:26:26.019 --> 1:26:28.105
No, no, this is not a life.

1:26:28.188 --> 1:26:30.691
We have to show people what Lyle can do.

1:26:31.483 --> 1:26:33.402
That they don't have to be scared of him.

1:26:33.485 --> 1:26:35.070
We gotta show them...

1:26:50.169 --> 1:26:52.129
Go, take Lyle. I've got this.

1:26:54.673 --> 1:26:55.883
Sorry, not this one.

1:26:59.178 --> 1:27:01.263
Give me a minute. Give me a minute.

1:27:02.181 --> 1:27:06.727
Prepare to have your flabber truly gasted.

1:27:18.363 --> 1:27:20.365
No, we have no one to drive it.

1:27:46.725 --> 1:27:48.477
Go, go, go.

1:27:48.560 --> 1:27:50.270
Go. Come on, Josh.

1:27:50.354 --> 1:27:51.688
Come on.

1:27:51.772 --> 1:27:53.565
<i>They're leaving the park. Call the police.</i>

1:27:53.649 --> 1:27:54.483
Copy.

1:27:57.861 --> 1:27:59.112
Sorry.

1:28:05.619 --> 1:28:07.037
How much further?

1:28:14.753 --> 1:28:15.671
Lyle.

1:28:18.632 --> 1:28:20.634
All units, we got a crocodile
on a motorcycle,

1:28:20.717 --> 1:28:22.261
entering the Theater District.

1:28:22.344 --> 1:28:23.929
<i>You got a what?</i>

1:29:13.395 --> 1:29:16.148
Where's Josh?
He's not in his room. I looked everywhere.

1:29:22.487 --> 1:29:24.489
What's he doing in Times Square?

1:29:25.616 --> 1:29:27.075
Hey, hey.

1:29:27.159 --> 1:29:28.410
I'm on the steps.

1:29:28.493 --> 1:29:30.621
Yeah, I need your help. Where is it?

1:29:32.539 --> 1:29:34.082
I'm at the backstage door.

1:29:43.008 --> 1:29:44.426
What are you doing here?

1:29:47.554 --> 1:29:48.555
Is...?

1:29:48.639 --> 1:29:49.640
Is...?

1:29:49.723 --> 1:29:52.976
Yes, and we need
to show people what he can do.

1:29:53.060 --> 1:29:54.603
We need your help.

1:29:55.771 --> 1:29:56.647
Trudy.

1:29:58.148 --> 1:29:59.149
Follow me.

1:30:02.819 --> 1:30:03.820
Whoa, hey.

1:30:04.363 --> 1:30:08.158
Kaysha from Kingsport, check.
Where's Kaysha from...?

1:30:12.287 --> 1:30:13.163
Security?

1:30:13.247 --> 1:30:15.541
Yet another unbelievable performance.

1:30:15.624 --> 1:30:19.336
Text your vote to the long number
on the bottom of your screens.

1:30:19.419 --> 1:30:22.673
Once again, Tamia and Talullah.

1:30:22.756 --> 1:30:25.384
And if you thought
the talent stopped there,

1:30:25.467 --> 1:30:26.718
oh, boy, are...

1:30:40.107 --> 1:30:42.025
-What is happening?
-What is going on?

1:30:42.109 --> 1:30:44.236
Wait, is that a real crocodile?

1:30:50.450 --> 1:30:51.410
<i>Do you have him?</i>

1:30:51.493 --> 1:30:52.619
Got him, sir. Copy.

1:31:01.503 --> 1:31:03.714
You're just gonna have to trust me now.

1:31:04.298 --> 1:31:05.132
This is it.

1:31:05.674 --> 1:31:07.384
Lyle, you have to sing.

1:31:10.137 --> 1:31:11.430
It's okay.

1:31:14.266 --> 1:31:15.976
We'll do it together.

1:31:38.332 --> 1:31:42.002
<i>Maybe we started pretty small</i>

1:31:42.085 --> 1:31:45.047
<i>But take a look at us now</i>

1:31:45.130 --> 1:31:48.800
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1:31:51.053 --> 1:31:55.057
<i>Suddenly standing 10 feet tall</i>

1:31:55.140 --> 1:31:57.684
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1:31:57.768 --> 1:32:02.731
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1:32:04.274 --> 1:32:07.736
<i>Buddy, you were all it took</i>

1:32:12.658 --> 1:32:16.161
<i>So take a look at us</i>

1:32:17.496 --> 1:32:18.830
You have to show them.

1:32:20.832 --> 1:32:25.420
<i>Take a look at us</i>

1:32:27.756 --> 1:32:29.675
<i>Now</i>

1:32:29.758 --> 1:32:32.719
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1:32:32.803 --> 1:32:39.643
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1:32:42.980 --> 1:32:44.940
<i>Oh, yeah</i>

1:32:45.524 --> 1:32:49.945
<i>When that perfect plan's
Going off the rails</i>

1:32:50.028 --> 1:32:53.156
<i>A heap of trouble is on our tails</i>

1:32:53.240 --> 1:32:57.286
<i>It's time to polish up those scales</i>

1:32:57.369 --> 1:32:59.872
<i>And give it all we've got</i>

1:32:59.955 --> 1:33:03.834
<i>'Cause in the center of the spotlight</i>

1:33:03.917 --> 1:33:07.337
<i>We just might have found our spot</i>

1:33:09.256 --> 1:33:11.258
-Come on.
-Come on, let's go.

1:33:17.431 --> 1:33:20.225
<i>Give us a spotlight and a crowd</i>

1:33:20.309 --> 1:33:21.643
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1:33:21.727 --> 1:33:23.562
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1:33:23.645 --> 1:33:26.064
<i>Ready to sing our song out loud</i>

1:33:26.148 --> 1:33:28.150
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1:33:29.985 --> 1:33:31.486
<i>The big shebang</i>

1:33:31.570 --> 1:33:32.905
<i>Our grand debut</i>

1:33:32.988 --> 1:33:35.908
<i>Now we got the hang
Of the me plus you</i>

1:33:35.991 --> 1:33:41.705
<i>Seems our dreams
Just might come through somehow</i>

1:33:41.788 --> 1:33:44.750
<i>Buddy, you were all it took</i>

1:33:44.833 --> 1:33:47.753
<i>Buddy, you were all it took</i>

1:33:47.836 --> 1:33:50.088
<i>Buddy, you were all it took</i>

1:33:50.172 --> 1:33:53.008
<i>-Take a look at us now
-Take a look at us now</i>

1:33:53.091 --> 1:33:55.802
<i>-Take a look at us now
-Take a look at us now</i>

1:33:55.886 --> 1:33:59.139
<i>-Take a look at us now
-Take a look at us now</i>

1:33:59.223 --> 1:34:02.100
<i>-Take a look at us now
-Take a look at us now</i>

1:34:02.184 --> 1:34:04.811
<i>-Take a look at us now
-Take a look at us now</i>

1:34:04.895 --> 1:34:07.814
<i>-Take a look at us now
-Take a look at us now</i>

1:34:08.398 --> 1:34:11.360
<i>Yeah, yeah</i>

1:34:11.443 --> 1:34:13.362
<i>Yeah</i>

1:34:14.196 --> 1:34:21.203
<i>Take a look at us now</i>

1:34:32.047 --> 1:34:33.423
All right.

1:34:50.524 --> 1:34:54.152
The point I'm making,
Your Honor, is that nothing has changed.

1:34:54.236 --> 1:34:55.904
So the crocodile sang.

1:34:55.988 --> 1:34:56.947
So what?

1:34:57.030 --> 1:34:58.782
It wasn't even that good.

1:34:59.366 --> 1:35:02.703
Oh, you're just impressed
because it was a crocodile.

1:35:03.412 --> 1:35:05.998
It was still broken out of the zoo.

1:35:06.081 --> 1:35:10.669
And according to every single one
of the city's very own regulations,

1:35:10.752 --> 1:35:14.715
it cannot be kept in a domestic residence.

1:35:15.966 --> 1:35:18.468
-Order, order.
-It's okay.

1:35:20.470 --> 1:35:22.389
I'm afraid the plaintiff is right.

1:35:24.308 --> 1:35:26.226
But who wants to be merely right

1:35:26.310 --> 1:35:28.979
when you can be
fabulously triumphant instead?

1:35:29.062 --> 1:35:30.606
Good morning, Your Honor. Excuse me.

1:35:30.689 --> 1:35:33.650
I have some documents here
that were stolen from me

1:35:33.734 --> 1:35:36.236
which are
of vital importance to this case.

1:35:36.320 --> 1:35:37.237
What documents?

1:35:37.321 --> 1:35:40.282
The original deeds
to the house on East 88th Street.

1:35:40.365 --> 1:35:42.784
How'd you get those?
Those were under my bed.

1:35:42.868 --> 1:35:44.953
I was led to them by a new friend.

1:35:47.915 --> 1:35:49.041
Why?

1:35:49.124 --> 1:35:50.792
-Let me see that.
-Of course.

1:35:52.252 --> 1:35:54.880
Those papers date from the time
of my maternal grandmother,

1:35:54.963 --> 1:35:56.757
Evelyn T. Valenti.

1:35:57.341 --> 1:36:00.135
Not just the woman
who built the house on East 88th Street,

1:36:00.219 --> 1:36:03.889
but the woman
who was the founder of the New York Zoo.

1:36:03.972 --> 1:36:05.432
-This is nonsense.
-What?

1:36:05.516 --> 1:36:08.477
This is a special deed
granted by the City of New York.

1:36:08.560 --> 1:36:12.272
In acknowledgment to my grandmother's
contributions to the city,

1:36:12.356 --> 1:36:15.526
and to accommodate
her fascination for the animals.

1:36:15.609 --> 1:36:18.445
"The house on East 88th Street
is hereby granted

1:36:18.529 --> 1:36:23.700
a special waiver
to house any exotic creature as a pet."

1:36:24.326 --> 1:36:28.497
Certainly Your Honor cannot be
stupid enough to consider this.

1:36:32.751 --> 1:36:33.752
Approved.

1:36:34.294 --> 1:36:35.295
Yes.

1:36:37.172 --> 1:36:40.008
Your Honor, this is ridiculous.

1:36:40.092 --> 1:36:41.760
I demand a mistrial.

1:36:41.844 --> 1:36:43.136
This is absurd.

1:36:44.221 --> 1:36:45.597
Wait a second. Loretta?

1:36:45.681 --> 1:36:47.516
-Hey.
-Loretta?

1:36:55.482 --> 1:36:57.860
Keep your filthy hands off of my Loretta!

1:37:03.156 --> 1:37:04.700
All right, everybody, let's go.

1:37:04.783 --> 1:37:05.909
Relax, we got time.

1:37:06.577 --> 1:37:08.245
I'm gonna get the sunscreen.

1:37:08.328 --> 1:37:11.373
Wait, wait. What's all of this? Where...?

1:37:11.456 --> 1:37:12.708
Hector, good morning.

1:37:12.791 --> 1:37:14.751
-Where are you going?
-Get in the car, guys.

1:37:14.835 --> 1:37:18.255
Hold on. I've already got Lyle
over 200 bookings.

1:37:18.338 --> 1:37:20.299
Two hundred bookings in New York alone.

1:37:20.382 --> 1:37:23.760
Once we roll out a national tour,
we're gonna be swimming in cash.

1:37:23.844 --> 1:37:27.472
We're not going on a national tour.
We're going on vacation.

1:37:27.556 --> 1:37:28.599
On a what?

1:37:28.682 --> 1:37:31.685
Have you ever
even been on vacation before, Lyle?

1:37:35.939 --> 1:37:37.274
I got you a floatie.

1:37:40.444 --> 1:37:41.278
That's cute.

1:37:49.828 --> 1:37:51.955
Okay, okay. Fine, fine.

1:37:52.039 --> 1:37:54.750
We'll do a stadium tour instead.

1:37:54.833 --> 1:37:56.043
Fewer dates,

1:37:56.126 --> 1:37:58.504
but we'll pack in just as many people.

1:38:03.050 --> 1:38:04.051
Bye.

1:38:06.428 --> 1:38:07.262
Bye.

1:38:10.224 --> 1:38:11.183
Bye.

1:38:12.392 --> 1:38:13.393
Hector?

1:38:13.477 --> 1:38:14.311
Yes?

1:38:17.940 --> 1:38:19.775
I'm sorry, kid, but...

1:38:21.026 --> 1:38:22.069
Do it, Malfoy.

1:38:40.838 --> 1:38:42.172
Does he have an agent?

1:38:45.801 --> 1:38:46.969
He does now.

1:38:50.472 --> 1:38:52.140
He's got an attitude.

1:38:55.727 --> 1:38:56.562
Let's go.

1:38:58.021 --> 1:38:59.273
And we're off.

1:39:07.155 --> 1:39:08.365
How about...?

1:39:11.159 --> 1:39:12.494
Play Lyle's music.

1:39:25.966 --> 1:39:29.511
<i>But the biggest kick I ever got</i>

1:39:29.595 --> 1:39:32.764
<i>Was doing a thing
Called the Crocodile Rock</i>

1:39:32.848 --> 1:39:35.642
<i>While the other kids
Were rocking 'round the clock</i>

1:39:35.726 --> 1:39:37.060
Hey, Loretta.

1:39:37.144 --> 1:39:40.147
<i>We were hopping and bopping
To the Crocodile Rock, yeah</i>

1:39:40.230 --> 1:39:42.566
<i>Croc Rocking is something shocking</i>

1:39:42.649 --> 1:39:45.694
<i>When your feet just can't keep still</i>

1:39:46.236 --> 1:39:51.950
<i>I never knew me a better time
And I guess I never will</i>

1:39:52.492 --> 1:39:55.495
<i>Oh, Lordy, mama
Those Friday nights</i>

1:39:55.579 --> 1:39:58.957
<i>When Susie wore her dresses tight</i>

1:39:59.499 --> 1:40:04.379
<i>Crocodile Rocking was out of sight</i>
