WEBVTT

00:07.800 --> 00:10.000
So no one touched the body?
I don't know

00:10.300 --> 00:11.700
No. We're going to need
an ID ASAP.

00:11.900 --> 00:14.700
Could be dealing with a group that's
acquired nuclear material.

00:14.800 --> 00:16.600
It's actually glowing?
Oh, yes.

00:16.600 --> 00:18.500
I'll need a video link with my lab.
Excuse me, Major.

00:18.600 --> 00:20.399
The reactor
at Kensington is secure.

00:20.400 --> 00:22.700
All transports carrying
radioactive material
have been halted.

00:23.600 --> 00:26.000
Dr. Brennan's going to need a video linkup
to the Jeffersonian.

00:26.000 --> 00:27.380
As soon as possible.

00:27.550 --> 00:29.650
The rain's really
slowed things up.
All right, thanks.

00:29.750 --> 00:32.150
See, uh, bodies, they
don't usually glow.

00:32.250 --> 00:34.300
Yeah, well, that's
why we're taking all
these precautions.

00:35.950 --> 00:37.550
All right, this is
potassium iodide.

00:37.650 --> 00:39.350
These are your suits.

00:40.450 --> 00:42.350
Pills?
Yeah.

00:42.350 --> 00:44.250
It helps...

00:44.250 --> 00:46.150
the thyroid block the
absorption of radiation.

00:50.900 --> 00:52.100
You know...

00:52.380 --> 00:54.380
Angela turned down
Hodgins again.

00:54.380 --> 00:55.580
What?

00:55.640 --> 00:58.800
Hodgins proposed and Angela
turned him down.

00:59.120 --> 01:00.620
You really want to talk
about that now?

01:00.620 --> 01:02.920
Why not? There's been no
confirmation of danger.

01:03.020 --> 01:04.519
It's just, you know, weird.

01:04.620 --> 01:06.820
You know, talking about,
uh, marriage

01:06.820 --> 01:09.220
when we're trying
to avoid radiation poisoning.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.020
What's weird is Angela thinking
about marriage at all.

01:12.311 --> 01:14.811
People fall in love and they get
married, that's what people do.

01:14.811 --> 01:16.211
You didn't want
to talk about it.

01:16.311 --> 01:18.611
I'm just saying...
you believe in love, don't you?

01:18.611 --> 01:19.911
I believe that dopamine

01:20.011 --> 01:21.711
and norepinephrine
stimulate euphoria

01:21.811 --> 01:23.511
because of certain
biological triggers

01:23.611 --> 01:25.711
like scent,
symmetrical features...

01:25.811 --> 01:27.211
Symmetrical features?

01:27.311 --> 01:29.711
Yes, it's an indication
of a good breeder.

01:29.711 --> 01:32.011
You appear to be
a very good breeder.

01:33.211 --> 01:34.911
How long have you two
been going out?

01:35.011 --> 01:37.011
We're...
We're...

01:37.111 --> 01:38.411
We're partners.
Partners.

01:38.511 --> 01:41.811
Me and my partner talk baseball.

01:42.850 --> 01:43.990
You might not want
to admit it, Bones,

01:44.000 --> 01:45.090
but there's some things,
like love,

01:45.450 --> 01:47.750
that just can't be measured
in your lab.

01:52.900 --> 01:54.500
Oh, what's that mean?

01:54.500 --> 01:56.400
300 millirems.

01:56.500 --> 01:58.300
Well, that's
perfectly normal.

01:58.400 --> 02:02.200
If we get a reading of 3,000
or more, then we worry.

02:02.300 --> 02:04.700
It could be a weapon.
Nuclear?

02:04.800 --> 02:06.400
The suits would be
useless against that.

02:06.600 --> 02:08.199
Oh, great, thanks.

02:08.699 --> 02:10.600
The body's in there.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:20.100 --> 02:21.300
Anybody getting an increase?

02:21.400 --> 02:22.700
All clear here.

02:22.800 --> 02:23.800
No, nothing here.

02:25.200 --> 02:26.600
Me, too. I don't
understand.

02:33.400 --> 02:37.200
Female, mid-20s,

02:37.300 --> 02:40.600
early 30s, Caucasian.

02:40.800 --> 02:42.300
Looks like she's been
there awhile.

02:42.760 --> 02:44.260
Probably not that long;
rats and weasels

02:44.360 --> 02:46.060
work pretty quickly.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.520
There's no
radiation in here.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.410
Then why the hell
is it glowing?

02:50.410 --> 02:52.410
I don't know.

02:52.510 --> 02:54.000
But it's your problem now.

02:54.140 --> 02:55.359
???

02:55.360 --> 02:57.310
Multiple stab wounds.

02:59.010 --> 03:01.310
Why is she glowing?

03:02.480 --> 03:04.010
I have no idea.

03:06.500 --> 03:08.700
No idea at all.

03:11.800 --> 03:18.826

03:41.900 --> 03:44.499
Nicks on the ribs
and hemorrhaging

03:44.500 --> 03:46.000
in the adjacent
intercostal muscles

03:46.100 --> 03:48.200
are consistent
with stabbing.

03:49.220 --> 03:50.899
Repeated stabbing.

03:50.900 --> 03:52.100
Someone was angry.

03:52.730 --> 03:54.230
Incised cuts on the left radius

03:54.230 --> 03:56.730
and ulna are congruent
with defensive injuries.

03:56.730 --> 03:58.730
Still no answer
for the luminescent bones?

03:58.730 --> 04:01.530
It's not like we get a human
lightbulb in here every day.

04:02.320 --> 04:03.300
I've got mature

04:03.400 --> 04:06.700
first instar Phaenicia sericata
about to moult.

04:06.700 --> 04:08.900
Indicates she's been dead
approximately 48 hours.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.400
I've got to take more
scrapings from the bones

04:11.400 --> 04:13.100
to analyze for luminescence.

04:13.200 --> 04:14.700
You can scrape this area.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.700
Okay, squint squad,

04:19.700 --> 04:21.899
why does she look
like a glow stick?

04:21.899 --> 04:23.900
Why does everyone think
my job is so easy?

04:24.200 --> 04:26.100
Wow, you weren't kidding.

04:26.850 --> 04:29.450
If we twirl her around,
we can pretend we're at a rave.

04:29.600 --> 04:31.100
What's the good word, Hodgins?

04:31.200 --> 04:33.500
Hey, I am not a party trick.

04:33.500 --> 04:35.100
Are you okay?

04:35.200 --> 04:37.300
The bones probably
remind him

04:37.300 --> 04:38.519
of Waitomo Cave.

04:38.520 --> 04:39.920
Not... true.

04:40.020 --> 04:41.320
I've been there
in New Zealand,

04:41.420 --> 04:43.220
it's filled with
tiny glowing worms

04:43.220 --> 04:45.220
and in the darkness
it looks like

04:45.320 --> 04:47.919
thousands of stars...
very romantic.

04:48.280 --> 04:50.780
Yes, that's where he was
going to take Angela
for their honeymoon.

04:51.650 --> 04:53.999
If she'd said yes....
which she didn't.

04:56.950 --> 04:58.950
Okay, look, people,
Angela and I are cool.

04:59.250 --> 05:00.650
Okay?

05:00.750 --> 05:02.750
But she's complicated.

05:03.100 --> 05:04.400
I will figure her out though,

05:04.400 --> 05:06.200
just like these
electric bones.

05:08.430 --> 05:10.860
So let's all just go back to work, okay?

05:11.160 --> 05:11.649
All right.

05:11.650 --> 05:12.950
Okay.
Sure.

05:13.220 --> 05:15.820
Nice bracelet.

05:15.820 --> 05:16.920
Do you need the left hand?

05:17.220 --> 05:20.420
No, too fleshy
and no stab wounds.

05:20.520 --> 05:22.400
Just how I like 'em.

05:26.720 --> 05:28.740
Oh... what are you doing?

05:28.840 --> 05:31.340
Plugging a dyke or something?

05:31.440 --> 05:33.740
The left hand was
lodged under the body.

05:34.140 --> 05:36.590
A lack of exposure preserved
some of the dermis.

05:36.690 --> 05:38.990
We might be able to get a print.
From that?

05:39.140 --> 05:41.690
It's all shriveled.

05:41.980 --> 05:43.880
Can you pour fabric softener.

05:43.980 --> 05:45.380
Yeah, sure.

05:45.380 --> 05:46.780
My mom used to use this stuff.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.980
I didn't know it was
so, uh, scientific.

05:48.980 --> 05:50.080
Say when.

05:50.180 --> 05:51.280
That's good.

05:51.380 --> 05:52.780
You think Hodgins is okay?

05:52.880 --> 05:54.480
No, not at all.

05:55.230 --> 05:57.330
Well, they seem to be jumping
each other like rabbits.

05:57.700 --> 05:59.600
Well, he wants more.

05:59.600 --> 06:00.800
How sweet.

06:00.800 --> 06:03.100
Oh, you think all
a man wants is sex?

06:03.200 --> 06:04.400
No, of course not.

06:04.400 --> 06:05.400
Beer, too.

06:06.400 --> 06:07.900
Chips, salsa...

06:08.000 --> 06:10.500
Oh, come on, Cam,
I mean, when we were together,

06:10.600 --> 06:12.300
you think that we could,
you know...

06:12.400 --> 06:13.400
Get married?

06:13.800 --> 06:14.500
No.

06:14.750 --> 06:16.250
Nah, me neither.

06:16.350 --> 06:18.450
But wasn't there a moment,
just a moment,

06:18.550 --> 06:20.450
where you felt... wow.

06:20.450 --> 06:22.450
It's a finger again.

06:22.450 --> 06:24.450
Huh.

06:25.550 --> 06:27.750
You know what I felt, Seeley?

06:27.850 --> 06:29.050
I felt...

06:30.750 --> 06:32.750
satisfied.

06:33.100 --> 06:35.250
Very satisfied.

06:36.700 --> 06:39.800
And grateful that
I had my own place,

06:39.900 --> 06:41.000
my own single life,

06:41.200 --> 06:43.000
and you were, too.

06:43.100 --> 06:46.700
Why are we even
talking about this?

06:53.820 --> 06:55.820
Check this out.

06:57.620 --> 07:01.020
Whoa.
One perfect fingerprint.

07:01.020 --> 07:04.420
Unbelievable,
all from fabric softener?

07:04.520 --> 07:07.620
Rehydrates dried tissue
and fights static cling.

07:07.620 --> 07:09.999
Eh, geez. Puffy soft, huh?

07:10.400 --> 07:12.320
21 loads, look at that.

07:14.130 --> 07:15.930
Okay, Carly Victor, 29...

07:17.300 --> 07:18.300
Carly Victor?!

07:19.500 --> 07:20.300
Do you know her?

07:20.580 --> 07:23.280
Yeah, she's that celebrity chef.

07:23.530 --> 07:25.530
Carly's Table over on Calvert.

07:25.530 --> 07:27.830
Chef would explain the cuts
to her left hand

07:27.830 --> 07:29.030
and the burns.

07:29.030 --> 07:31.130
All right, this is
her MySpace page.

07:31.130 --> 07:33.100
Is that the place
with the famous mac and cheese?

07:33.300 --> 07:34.899
Yeah, it's, like,
impossible to get into.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.430
Totally impossible.

07:37.560 --> 07:37.989
You, too?

07:38.810 --> 07:40.600
Mac and cheese,
that's God's best handiwork.

07:40.700 --> 07:42.100
She puts leeks in it

07:42.200 --> 07:44.300
and little bits of pancetta;
it was delicious.

07:44.740 --> 07:46.450
How did you get in?

07:46.450 --> 07:49.050
I'm a best-selling author,
Booth; I get in anywhere.

07:49.150 --> 07:50.450
I took Sully.

07:50.960 --> 07:51.560
Did he have...?

07:51.700 --> 07:53.300
Said it was
"the best he ever ate."

07:53.730 --> 07:55.630
Why are all those
pictures on her page?

07:55.780 --> 07:56.880
That's friends...

07:57.000 --> 07:58.800
different communities
she's joined.

07:59.000 --> 08:01.980
blogs, her husband,
cooking videos.

08:02.230 --> 08:04.200
A lot of knives
in the kitchen.

08:04.230 --> 08:06.130
Easy grab for one of these
"friends" to stab her.

08:06.230 --> 08:07.530
Why don't you check the pages

08:07.630 --> 08:09.030
and see if anyone had a problem
with her.

08:09.180 --> 08:11.230
I can't imagine anyone
wanting to kill Carly.

08:15.380 --> 08:17.680
She came out to see
if we were enjoying our meal.

08:17.930 --> 08:20.530
We talked for a while, I was...

08:22.530 --> 08:23.930
...supposed to go back

08:24.030 --> 08:25.930
and see her next week.

08:26.500 --> 08:27.800
Are you okay, honey?

08:28.700 --> 08:29.800
Yeah.

08:30.450 --> 08:32.600
I'm just used to victims
being strangers.

08:41.150 --> 08:43.250
We should tell
her husband, Booth.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.200
Sure.

08:52.910 --> 08:55.060
Welcome to Carly's Table.
Do you have a reservation?

08:55.380 --> 08:57.080
Like that's possible.

08:57.200 --> 08:58.800
Oh, Dr. Brennan.

08:58.800 --> 09:00.600
I'm sorry I didn't
see you there.

09:02.150 --> 09:03.230
We're very crowded tonight,

09:03.390 --> 09:05.390
so you might have to
wait for a few minutes.

09:05.390 --> 09:06.860
You can walk in here
without a reservation?

09:06.900 --> 09:08.600
We need to talk to Dan.
Carly's husband.

09:08.700 --> 09:09.900
Oh, just a moment.

09:10.410 --> 09:12.400
She knows he's
Carly's husband.

09:12.910 --> 09:15.010
Bones, Bones, Bones,
mac and cheese,

09:15.010 --> 09:16.510
mac and cheese.

09:17.250 --> 09:18.650
Booth.

09:18.650 --> 09:21.950
Wow... that's amazing.

09:21.950 --> 09:22.930
...awesome, we'd love
to tell Carly.

09:23.180 --> 09:24.910
She's a little slammed
right now, but I'll be sure

09:24.920 --> 09:26.520
to pass on the compliments,
all right?

09:26.620 --> 09:27.920
All right, take care.

09:29.500 --> 09:30.900
Oh, Carly's in the kitchen?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.500
Yeah, she's back there 24/7.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.400
You have to drag her out.

09:34.500 --> 09:35.800
Dr. Brennan, right?

09:35.900 --> 09:37.600
Yes. This is my partner,

09:37.700 --> 09:39.900
Special Agent Seeley Booth.

09:40.000 --> 09:40.700
Hi.

09:41.100 --> 09:42.600
We know she's not
back there, Dan.

09:47.980 --> 09:49.800
I just can't imagine she's...
she's gone.

09:51.180 --> 09:52.680
I'm so sorry, Dan.

09:54.700 --> 09:56.411
When was the last time
you saw her?

09:56.600 --> 09:57.900
Friday night.

09:58.230 --> 10:01.030
A lot of the restaurants
around here have been
getting robbed, so...

10:01.130 --> 10:02.930
Carly didn't want
to leave the cash here.

10:03.030 --> 10:05.030
She and Abby
took the cash

10:05.130 --> 10:06.630
and drove it to the ATM.

10:06.630 --> 10:08.830
Who's Abby?
Abby Singer.

10:08.930 --> 10:12.730
She and her boyfriend, Ben,
are our business partners.

10:12.830 --> 10:14.000
They're friends first.

10:14.300 --> 10:17.100
Abby organizes Carly's
endorsements...

10:17.260 --> 10:18.860
I mean, it's...

10:18.960 --> 10:20.660
It's not Abby as well, is it?

10:20.760 --> 10:23.760
No, we only...
we only found Carly.

10:23.860 --> 10:26.160
Has Ben heard from Abby?

10:26.160 --> 10:29.060
Ben's-- he's in the Guard.

10:29.160 --> 10:31.120
And, um, he's been gone
for the weekend.

10:31.130 --> 10:33.230
He should be back
in a couple hours.

10:33.230 --> 10:34.530
Help me understand
something here, Dan.

10:34.530 --> 10:36.479
Your wife disappears and you
don't report her missing?

10:36.480 --> 10:38.280
She would take these
spur-of-the-moment trips

10:38.380 --> 10:42.280
to Atlantic City with Abby
to kind of blow off steam.

10:42.460 --> 10:43.960
She wouldn't tell you first?

10:44.060 --> 10:45.260
No, she wouldn't tell me

10:45.360 --> 10:46.660
'cause she didn't
want me to say "no."

10:46.760 --> 10:48.360
Listen, what kind of car
did they leave in?

10:48.950 --> 10:51.750
She, um... she had an old Volvo.

10:52.630 --> 10:54.130
Abby did.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.650
The picture was taken

10:55.650 --> 10:58.250
just before we opened.

10:58.730 --> 11:00.730
I'll get a search team on it.

11:05.900 --> 11:07.479
You find anything?

11:07.480 --> 11:09.980
Yeah, jealous chefs,

11:11.130 --> 11:12.030
vicious critics,

11:12.620 --> 11:14.520
fans that were a little
too in love with her.

11:15.720 --> 11:16.720
Fame is creepy.

11:16.950 --> 11:18.750
They say chefs
are the new rock stars.

11:18.850 --> 11:22.250
They do deal with knives
and fire and food.

11:22.250 --> 11:23.550
It's pretty sexy.

11:23.550 --> 11:25.150
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

11:25.250 --> 11:26.950
Well, then tonight...

11:27.050 --> 11:29.150
I'll take a knife and fire,

11:29.150 --> 11:31.850
and make you an orgasmic
grilled cheese sandwich.

11:31.950 --> 11:34.650
Oh, suddenly I'm starving.

11:37.050 --> 11:38.250
Oh, good Lord.

11:38.250 --> 11:40.250
You have to stop mounting
each other in the office.

11:40.350 --> 11:41.950
Doesn't marriage destroy sex?

11:41.950 --> 11:43.450
Please, Angela, say yes.

11:43.450 --> 11:44.550
We were working.

11:44.650 --> 11:45.950
You were working it.

11:46.400 --> 11:49.100
A little professionalism
would be nice, people.

11:49.200 --> 11:52.600
I found some organic material
in a cut on her left hand.

11:52.700 --> 11:54.000
I need to know
what it is.

11:54.020 --> 11:55.220
I'm on it.

11:55.690 --> 11:57.090
And you? Anything?

11:57.490 --> 11:59.790
Yeah, I found out how
to make braised beef.

11:59.990 --> 12:02.890
I found out
that Carly loved sushi.

12:02.990 --> 12:04.700
I found out...
My God...sushi.

12:04.920 --> 12:06.120
Yes, that is it.

12:06.220 --> 12:07.820
You are brilliant.

12:08.020 --> 12:09.420
You're my muse.

12:09.520 --> 12:11.020
Check out all
the sushi restaurants

12:11.120 --> 12:12.520
on her site.

12:16.890 --> 12:18.190
At least
he didn't jump you.

12:18.360 --> 12:19.500
True.

12:20.160 --> 12:22.460
So you were
with the Reserves

12:22.560 --> 12:24.649
At Fort Eustis.
Survival training.

12:24.650 --> 12:25.850
You're sure Carly
was murdered?

12:26.050 --> 12:27.250
Yes.

12:27.250 --> 12:28.450
I mean, isn't
there anything

12:28.450 --> 12:30.650
I could be doing?
Helping you look for Abby.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.450
I mean, I can't just sit here.

12:32.450 --> 12:34.550
We're doing everything
we can to find her.
And you're looking

12:34.650 --> 12:35.889
for whoever's been robbing
the other restaurants?

12:35.890 --> 12:38.890
Mm-hmm. We just don't have
a description yet, that's all.

12:39.900 --> 12:41.400
Why didn't Dan report them
missing?

12:41.800 --> 12:44.100
He said that
they would take off sometimes.

12:44.550 --> 12:45.650
Go to Atlantic City.

12:46.050 --> 12:47.150
Yeah, but still.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.100
The restaurant was booming.

12:49.400 --> 12:52.000
I mean, he should have known
that she wouldn't just leave.

12:52.100 --> 12:53.500
Listen, do you, uh...

12:53.600 --> 12:55.100
You and Dan--
are you having problems?

12:55.200 --> 12:57.000
What? No.

12:57.240 --> 12:59.240
No. He just
doesn't think sometimes.

13:00.620 --> 13:02.400
I mean, we're not
in school anymore.

13:03.350 --> 13:05.750
I just would have
done something, that's all.

13:08.250 --> 13:09.400
Look,

13:10.480 --> 13:12.650
here's Abby's picture
if you need it.

13:15.480 --> 13:16.980
Just find Abby.

13:19.330 --> 13:20.880
Please.

13:21.630 --> 13:22.990
The sushi got me thinking.

13:23.320 --> 13:25.000
P. phosphoreum.

13:25.450 --> 13:28.050
It's a bacteria
that grows in seafood.

13:28.150 --> 13:29.249
A luminescent
bacterium?

13:29.250 --> 13:31.550
Exactly.
Vibrio bacteria,

13:31.700 --> 13:33.900
which, when catalyzed
by luciferase,

13:33.900 --> 13:35.800
causes the bones to glow.

13:36.250 --> 13:38.150
So if the knife
that was used to stab Carly

13:38.250 --> 13:39.550
contained P. phosphoreum,

13:39.550 --> 13:40.260
it would've entered
her bloodstream.

13:40.680 --> 13:42.679
And it would be left on the
bones as the tissue decomposed

13:42.680 --> 13:45.400
and was stripped by the rats.

13:45.410 --> 13:46.080
Seafood.

13:46.310 --> 13:50.000
So that narrows it down...
to every restaurant in the area.

13:50.050 --> 13:50.509
No.

13:50.510 --> 13:55.240
The tissue Cam found--
it's Uni, sea urchin,

13:56.240 --> 13:57.840
a specialty
in one

13:57.940 --> 13:59.940
of Carly's favorite
sushi restaurants.

14:00.700 --> 14:03.600
Carly's blog mentions
an old friend

14:03.700 --> 14:05.600
who's the chef
at a sushi restaurant.

14:05.970 --> 14:08.470
SushiGuy23.

14:08.470 --> 14:09.770
How imaginative.

14:09.870 --> 14:11.670
Executive chef
at Sushi Beat Restaurant.

14:11.710 --> 14:13.233
And when we link to his page...

14:13.710 --> 14:15.210
That's Carly.

14:15.740 --> 14:17.640
With SushiGuy.

14:19.300 --> 14:21.420
???

14:37.030 --> 14:38.000
Can you believe
this place?

14:38.030 --> 14:39.100
Yeah. Fresh toro today.

14:39.230 --> 14:40.530
Cherry-picked the most
marketable elements

14:40.530 --> 14:43.310
of a very complex
and vibrant culture,

14:43.320 --> 14:45.419
and then repackaged
them ÷o turn a profit.

14:45.420 --> 14:46.420
It's awful.

14:46.590 --> 14:48.090
Yeah, well,
so is murder, okay?

14:48.190 --> 14:49.390
So just stay focused.

14:51.290 --> 14:54.090
Hey, Ernie,
have a minute?

14:55.100 --> 14:56.100
I guess.

14:56.590 --> 14:57.590
Can I get you anything?

14:57.600 --> 14:58.850
No. We're just
here to ask...

14:58.860 --> 14:59.870
Oh, sure. I mean,
if you have some 

15:00.100 --> 15:02.300
of that fresh toro left,
that would be great.

15:03.610 --> 15:05.510
What? Might as well eat lunch
while we're here.

15:06.200 --> 15:08.930
You and Carly Victor were
high school sweethearts, right?

15:09.400 --> 15:10.700
Why? What's going on?

15:11.450 --> 15:12.950
Uh, when was the last time
you saw her?

15:13.630 --> 15:15.630
Uh, Thursday of last week.

15:15.850 --> 15:17.350
Why? Did something
happen to her?

15:17.450 --> 15:18.650
Do you serve sea urchin?

15:18.750 --> 15:20.350
Uni, yeah. It's one
of my specialties.

15:20.450 --> 15:21.550
You want some?

15:21.550 --> 15:23.150
Sure.
No.

15:25.400 --> 15:27.300
Is this about Dan?

15:27.400 --> 15:29.100
Did Dan find out
she was with me?

15:29.200 --> 15:31.000
Why? What's going on
between you and Carly?

15:31.100 --> 15:32.300
Nothing.

15:32.400 --> 15:34.000
We reconnected on MySpace.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.200
She wanted to learn
about Japanese cuisine, so

15:36.300 --> 15:37.600
I was teaching her
how to make sushi.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.900
Secretly?

15:39.700 --> 15:41.600
Why, because
Dan hated Japanese food?

15:41.700 --> 15:43.300
Because he's so jealous.

15:43.400 --> 15:45.000
Everybody loved Carly.

15:45.600 --> 15:46.750
It drove him crazy.

15:46.830 --> 15:48.230
Carly even
left him once.

15:48.430 --> 15:49.730
Why'd she go back?

15:50.930 --> 15:52.489
Delicious.

15:52.490 --> 15:54.000
Thank you.

15:55.000 --> 15:56.800
What's going on? Is Carly okay?

15:58.830 --> 15:59.850
Carly's dead.

16:03.980 --> 16:05.400
Dan?

16:06.220 --> 16:06.939
That son of a bitch.

16:06.940 --> 16:09.740
We don't know who it was,
but she was stabbed, Ernie,

16:09.840 --> 16:14.138
and we found bacteria associated
with sea urchin in her system.

16:14.350 --> 16:17.050
It can only enter the body
through the bloodstream.

16:17.200 --> 16:18.977
What, you think I killed her?
Why would I kill Carly?

16:19.430 --> 16:21.130
Well, that's more his area.

16:21.130 --> 16:23.430
You love her, she says
that she'll leave Dan,

16:23.430 --> 16:24.730
she doesn't, you get mad.

16:24.830 --> 16:26.030
She's got the fishy virus.

16:26.030 --> 16:27.830
You got all
these fishy knives.
Wait.

16:27.930 --> 16:30.130
Wait, wait. Last time Carly
was here, she cut herself,

16:30.130 --> 16:32.380
and I wanted her to get
stitches, but she wouldn't.

16:32.390 --> 16:33.990
I'd like
to borrow your knives, Ernie,

16:34.090 --> 16:36.590
and compare them to the injuries
we found on Carly.

16:38.700 --> 16:41.000
You know, a lot of people
have knives like mine.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.200
Are you saying no?

16:42.210 --> 16:44.710
Because that really
wouldn't look too good.

16:45.900 --> 16:47.800
Can I get a spicy
tuna roll?

16:55.000 --> 16:56.500
I fed the
measurements

16:56.600 --> 16:58.600
of the knives
into the computer--

16:58.700 --> 17:00.100
angles of the blades,
thickness--

17:00.350 --> 17:02.150
and compared it to the injuries
we found on the bones.

17:02.720 --> 17:05.720
None of them match the damage
evident on the cortical surface

17:05.819 --> 17:07.490
of the ribs
or the defensive wounds.

17:07.790 --> 17:10.520
No, but we do have one match.

17:11.290 --> 17:15.079
This knife and the cut
on her left hand.

17:15.520 --> 17:17.550
They knife they used when preparing the Uni.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.839
That must be how
it entered her bloodstream.

17:20.940 --> 17:22.460
SushiGuy23
was telling the truth.

17:22.670 --> 17:23.770
So he's not a murderer.

17:24.530 --> 17:26.030
We can still eat
at the restaurant.

17:26.900 --> 17:27.500
What?

17:27.653 --> 17:29.953
Booth said
the toro was fantastic.

17:30.053 --> 17:31.853
Are you still
torturing Hodgins?

17:32.890 --> 17:33.890
He loves it.

17:33.970 --> 17:36.000
Just tell him no,
put him out of his misery.

17:36.670 --> 17:38.000
What if I want
to say yes?

17:38.870 --> 17:40.000
You? Get married?

17:40.870 --> 17:43.070
Sometimes your brain
just shuts off

17:43.170 --> 17:44.570
because you're...

17:44.570 --> 17:46.870
in love.

17:46.970 --> 17:48.170
One can't logically

17:49.160 --> 17:51.570
base a decision on
momentary happiness.

17:52.050 --> 17:54.150
Haven't you ever
just looked at a guy

17:54.250 --> 17:55.250
and said, screw it?

17:55.580 --> 17:59.000
Maybe not the best choice
of words, okay, but...

18:00.280 --> 18:02.480
Like when you were with Sully.

18:03.480 --> 18:05.727
Don't you regret letting him go?

18:06.510 --> 18:07.410
I made a decision.

18:08.240 --> 18:10.000
Regrets serve no real purpose.

18:10.470 --> 18:11.620
If you want to
be impulsive,

18:11.640 --> 18:13.540
why don't you
just say yes?

18:13.860 --> 18:16.560
Because I've also got you
in my head telling me

18:16.660 --> 18:19.660
that marriage will hobble
my personal and legal freedoms.

18:20.720 --> 18:23.320
You're a very difficult best friend to have.

18:24.120 --> 18:25.000
Brennan.

18:29.320 --> 18:31.000
I'll grab my things.

18:31.520 --> 18:33.400
Ernie's story checked out.

18:33.720 --> 18:36.420
Carly took out
a restraining order on Dan,

18:36.520 --> 18:39.720
and Dan took out a $2 million
life insurance policy on her.

18:40.360 --> 18:41.860
See, marriage-- it... 
Oh, just go.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.030
I'm going.

18:44.620 --> 18:46.120
You guys had to shut down, huh?

18:46.120 --> 18:48.920
Yeah. Carly's without Carly
doesn't make much sense.

18:49.020 --> 18:50.720
Yeah, that's got to be rough.

18:51.360 --> 18:55.250
I mean, you know, absorbing
that kind of hit, financially.

18:55.660 --> 18:57.260
Look, man,
his wife was murdered,

18:57.360 --> 18:58.560
and my girlfriend's missing.

18:59.070 --> 19:00.970
Money is the last thing
on our minds.

19:00.970 --> 19:02.870
Yeah, right,
right, I-I... Yeah.

19:02.870 --> 19:04.570
I understand.
It's just, I mean...

19:04.570 --> 19:06.670
Here you guys are just,
you know, poring over the books.

19:06.670 --> 19:10.270
Most of our staff live
paycheck to paycheck.

19:10.270 --> 19:11.750
You know?
We have to pay them.

19:11.760 --> 19:13.160
Where is the other knife?

19:13.260 --> 19:14.960
I don't know. It's been
missing for years.

19:15.060 --> 19:16.560
Carly actually
got it as a gift

19:16.660 --> 19:18.360
from the first chef
that she worked for.

19:18.460 --> 19:21.060
Hmm. Maybe it's just been
missing since you found out

19:21.160 --> 19:23.060
about, uh, Carly
and Ernie Summers.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.660
Ernie Summers?
The sushi guy?

19:24.760 --> 19:26.360
I'd like to take this set
of knives.

19:26.460 --> 19:27.160
Sure.

19:27.260 --> 19:28.860
No!
Hey, relax, man.

19:28.960 --> 19:30.360
If you just let them
take the knives...

19:30.460 --> 19:31.700
These bastards cannot come in
here and start accusing me...

19:31.710 --> 19:34.109
Carly was meeting up with Ernie
secretly. You assumed the worst?

19:34.110 --> 19:37.700
That's not true.
You confronted her,
one thing led to another.

19:37.710 --> 19:38.700
Carly was involved with him?

19:38.710 --> 19:40.110
Maybe Abby heard you fighting,
she tried

19:40.110 --> 19:41.230
to get in the
middle of it.

19:41.600 --> 19:42.700
You son of a bitch!

19:43.800 --> 19:45.800
She got caught up
in the middle.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.000
Get off of me!

19:47.370 --> 19:48.970
You know, I'd back down
if I were you.

19:49.070 --> 19:50.070
He shot a clown once.

19:50.470 --> 19:51.470
You're good?

19:51.570 --> 19:53.170
Good?
Yes, I'm good.

19:53.270 --> 19:55.570
Good.

19:55.670 --> 19:58.670
We know about the
restraining order
and your drinking.

19:59.740 --> 20:00.700
What did you do, Dan?

20:00.720 --> 20:02.020
Nothing, okay?

20:02.250 --> 20:03.650
We had some problems.

20:04.470 --> 20:05.370
I went into rehab...

20:05.400 --> 20:07.200
You were drinking
last week, Dan, before I left.

20:07.300 --> 20:08.300
A couple glasses of wine, okay?

20:08.300 --> 20:10.100
The stress
of everything.
And Carly?

20:10.200 --> 20:12.900
Yes, and Carly.
Why didn't you tell us
about that insurance policy?

20:13.980 --> 20:14.680
It was Ben's idea.

20:14.710 --> 20:16.440
This restaurant would be worth nothing
without Carly.

20:16.450 --> 20:18.350
We have investors.
We had to protect them.

20:18.450 --> 20:20.750
But if you had a problem
with Carly, I mean,

20:21.205 --> 20:22.405
you wouldn't need
the restaurant,

20:22.405 --> 20:23.300
still get your payday.

20:26.100 --> 20:27.200
Take the knives.

20:27.320 --> 20:28.500
Take anything you want.

20:28.820 --> 20:29.720
You son of a bitch.
You think that...

20:29.820 --> 20:30.820
Where's Abby?

20:30.920 --> 20:31.720
For God's sakes,
are you people crazy?

20:31.820 --> 20:33.120
I-I...
Booth.

20:33.120 --> 20:34.520
I loved Abby.

20:34.620 --> 20:35.420
I loved Carly. It was the four
of us.

20:35.430 --> 20:35.729
Thanks.

20:35.730 --> 20:37.330
Helicopter spotted Abby's car.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.000
Bones, stay back.

20:46.080 --> 20:47.980
You-you should wait here
until we can determine

20:48.080 --> 20:50.180
if she's in the car
and... if she's alive.

20:50.400 --> 20:51.229
Did you find her?

20:51.230 --> 20:52.300
No one's in the
vehicle, sir.

20:52.420 --> 20:53.820
What about
the trunk?
I haven't checked yet.

20:54.410 --> 20:55.510
Give me a crowbar.

20:55.510 --> 20:57.610
Come on!

21:03.960 --> 21:05.160
She's alive!

21:05.260 --> 21:06.460
Get an AEREVAC here right away!

21:07.120 --> 21:08.170
???

21:11.880 --> 21:13.870
Hang on, baby, please.

21:24.870 --> 21:25.770
I don't understand.

21:26.020 --> 21:27.420
Why wasn't Abby killed, too?

21:27.520 --> 21:29.920
Funny, but I haven't found
a written confession yet.

21:30.020 --> 21:31.320
But she's a witness.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.820
Blood traces on the dashboard
where the vinyl split.

21:35.730 --> 21:37.990
Lots of blood on the seat,
the floor mats.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.960
Looks like Carly was definitely
killed inside the car.

21:41.270 --> 21:42.870
Maybe whoever did this
saw what he'd done

21:42.970 --> 21:44.170
and lost the stomach for it

21:44.170 --> 21:45.270
when it came
to Abby.

21:45.560 --> 21:46.760
Hello.

21:46.860 --> 21:49.120
Possible semen
and vaginal contributions.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.230
'Cause this wasn't nasty enough.

22:00.790 --> 22:02.760
Ooh! Smells like a urinal.

22:03.700 --> 22:06.300
She was locked up for 36 hours.

22:06.300 --> 22:09.000
I can tell you, all she was
worried about was surviving.

22:10.120 --> 22:10.820
Sorry.

22:11.100 --> 22:12.700
I forgot you were buried.

22:15.230 --> 22:16.730
Look, if this is
too difficult, Hodgins...

22:16.830 --> 22:18.700
If I can help lock up
this bastard that did this,

22:19.430 --> 22:21.230
at least someone
gets justice, right?

22:24.420 --> 22:24.889
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

22:24.890 --> 22:25.890
Wait a minute.

22:26.340 --> 22:27.990
What is it?
Ah!

22:28.790 --> 22:31.090
Unidentified particulates.

22:31.190 --> 22:33.120
The two sweetest words I know.

22:33.910 --> 22:36.000
I don't even want to think about
your pillow talk with Angela.

22:39.080 --> 22:42.820
???utility knife,

22:44.010 --> 22:45.010
but sharp or dull,

22:45.450 --> 22:47.100
it couldn't have made
those injuries you found.

22:47.240 --> 22:48.980
So, the edge was
even sharper?

22:48.990 --> 22:49.869
Yeah.

22:49.870 --> 22:53.480
How much can you magnify
the cut to that rib?

22:54.550 --> 22:57.980
I can go about
600 times before degrading the image.

22:58.750 --> 23:01.750
Most blades are irregular and
pitted so they show on the bone.

23:01.990 --> 23:03.590
This is a knife

23:03.690 --> 23:05.399
without imperfections
on its edge.

23:05.400 --> 23:07.900
Do you really think
her husband killed her?

23:08.970 --> 23:12.390
I mean, it would make sense
he would spare Abby.

23:13.770 --> 23:15.730
I don't think
I'm the person to ask

23:15.760 --> 23:18.750
about psychology
of relationships.

23:20.690 --> 23:23.490
You know, when I said before that

23:24.500 --> 23:26.640
 you were
the difficult friend inside my head,

23:27.670 --> 23:29.740
that's not necessarily
a bad thing.

23:30.620 --> 23:35.360
Yeah, I know that sharing
a strong emotional attachment

23:35.370 --> 23:39.160
with another human being can be
a good thing,

23:40.560 --> 23:44.670
but there seems
to be a disconnect

23:44.960 --> 23:46.760
between my mind and...

23:46.860 --> 23:49.900
You know, I... I shouldn't
have brought up Sully before.

23:51.460 --> 23:52.460
I'm sorry.

23:53.250 --> 23:54.200
It's just...

23:56.250 --> 23:58.350
if a relationship seems

23:58.880 --> 24:00.700
more than casual,
I feel that I need

24:00.710 --> 24:03.120
to posit the potential problems,

24:03.910 --> 24:07.310
probabilities of success
and failure or...

24:07.410 --> 24:08.610
You get scared.

24:12.110 --> 24:14.770
But I miss so much,

24:15.310 --> 24:16.910
don't I?

24:18.760 --> 24:22.010
I want to say no, but yeah...

24:24.000 --> 24:25.000
...you do...

24:25.980 --> 24:28.580
and so does whoever
you're keeping yourself from.

24:30.200 --> 24:32.500
I compared the hairline fracture
on Carly's skull

24:32.600 --> 24:34.300
to the damaged dashboard.

24:34.400 --> 24:37.500
The fracture was the result
of her head smashing into it.

24:37.600 --> 24:40.450
Hemorrhaging indicates
it was ante-mortem.

24:40.800 --> 24:43.100
These white shards were found in
the trunk and some were caught

24:43.200 --> 24:44.300
on her socks.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.500
FBI techs also found similar
shards in the old house.

24:47.440 --> 24:49.440
So I'm running
a chemical analysis,

24:49.440 --> 24:51.230
but I'd say this is
some kind of ceramic.

24:51.250 --> 24:52.550
What? Like pottery?

24:53.640 --> 24:55.130
Actually, ceramics are used
in everything

24:55.140 --> 24:57.440
from semiconductors
to medical implants.

24:58.260 --> 24:59.810
This is a very hard ceramic.

24:59.990 --> 25:01.490
It's probably eight mohs.

25:01.890 --> 25:03.790
Yeah?
Yeah.

25:03.890 --> 25:05.000
What's that mean?

25:05.490 --> 25:08.400
That it was most likely used
for industrial applications.

25:09.930 --> 25:11.130
D--

25:11.230 --> 25:12.430
Mm.
What?

25:12.530 --> 25:14.630
No, I'm not going
to ask again.

25:15.380 --> 25:16.280
About the ceramic stuff?

25:16.280 --> 25:17.200
No.

25:17.980 --> 25:19.180
Angela.

25:19.800 --> 25:20.400
No more.

25:20.600 --> 25:21.600
I'm done.

25:21.600 --> 25:22.700
Oh.

25:22.800 --> 25:23.700
You're done
with Angela?

25:24.050 --> 25:25.150
No, but...

25:26.200 --> 25:28.300
...hey, I fell in love
with a free spirit

25:28.300 --> 25:32.300
and if getting married makes her
feel trapped or something,

25:32.400 --> 25:33.400
then I-I'm just going

25:33.400 --> 25:34.190
to have to deal
with it.

25:34.700 --> 25:37.200
Right, so you don't want
to get married anymore?

25:37.300 --> 25:38.500
Sure I do.
You know what?

25:38.600 --> 25:40.900
This whole ceramic stuff
was making more sense to me.

25:41.000 --> 25:42.600
But Angela doesn't, and I don't
want to drive her away

25:42.700 --> 25:44.250
like you did with Rebecca.

25:44.260 --> 25:45.000
Oh.

25:45.240 --> 25:48.240
I did not drive Rebecca away.

25:48.750 --> 25:50.440
We both agreed
that it wasn't right.

25:50.650 --> 25:52.099
After you asked and she said no.

25:52.100 --> 25:54.400
Well, when you say it
like that, it's...

25:54.400 --> 25:57.100
If it had been right,
it wouldn't matter

25:57.100 --> 25:59.200
if you were married
or not, would it?

25:59.200 --> 26:01.300
Because you'd have
a life together.

26:01.950 --> 26:04.150
Great, then why
not get married?

26:04.250 --> 26:07.150
Because then we wouldn't be
able to be together.

26:07.250 --> 26:09.350
See, this is all coming
so clear now.

26:09.450 --> 26:09.919
Ha, not really.

26:09.920 --> 26:12.550
You put on that macho front,
but inside you understand.

26:12.720 --> 26:13.720
I don't understand.
That which

26:13.820 --> 26:15.720
the mind can't grasp.
All right, you know,

26:15.720 --> 26:17.020
I'm just trying
to catch a murderer,

26:17.120 --> 26:18.733
but you seem
to have gone way past that.

26:19.020 --> 26:20.820
It means a lot,
knowing that you get it, man.

26:21.740 --> 26:23.820
Most guys are not secure
enough to admit that.
Hmm.

26:24.800 --> 26:25.800
I have a headache.

26:26.730 --> 26:27.550
Booth.

26:28.980 --> 26:30.080
Yeah, I'm on my way.

26:30.180 --> 26:32.080
Abby just...
woke up.

26:32.620 --> 26:34.340
I need you to figure out
what that stuff is.

26:34.350 --> 26:35.120
Okay.

26:35.750 --> 26:38.420
Um, it's so much easier just
to fight and shoot guns.

26:39.050 --> 26:40.250
Bones, she's awake!

26:40.350 --> 26:42.150
We're going!

26:46.650 --> 26:50.950
Uh... we had a lot of cash.

26:51.050 --> 26:52.150
There had been robberies.

26:52.450 --> 26:55.550
Carly wanted to take the money
to the ATM.

26:55.850 --> 26:59.050
Her and Dan fought about it,

26:59.150 --> 27:02.740
but Carly always did
what she wanted.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.640
He ran outside yelling.

27:07.600 --> 27:09.700
I didn't want to get
in the middle of it.

27:09.800 --> 27:10.700
Y-You're sure?

27:11.770 --> 27:13.270
She was stabbed?

27:13.370 --> 27:14.470
Yes.

27:14.470 --> 27:16.370
What happened when
you got in the car?

27:17.560 --> 27:20.270
We didn't suspect anything.

27:20.790 --> 27:23.000
He must have been hiding
in the back seat.

27:24.070 --> 27:25.570
Did you get
a look at him?

27:26.350 --> 27:27.350
No.

27:28.080 --> 27:28.980
He was wearing a mask.

27:29.730 --> 27:30.949
I panicked.

27:30.950 --> 27:31.730
I, uh...

27:32.870 --> 27:34.950
I tried to get out of the car,

27:36.080 --> 27:39.070
a-and he must have hit me, uh...

27:40.480 --> 27:43.280
'cause the next thing
I remember...

27:44.380 --> 27:49.280
is waking up in the trunk,
and, uh, you know, I...

27:50.570 --> 27:52.470
...I thought
I'd been buried alive.

27:54.270 --> 27:56.880
Do you have any idea
what that feels like?
Actually,

27:57.620 --> 28:01.600
I was buried alive in a car
just a few months ago with a colleague.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.299
with a colleague.
We were

28:03.300 --> 28:04.800
able to use the airbag cannis...

28:04.900 --> 28:05.800
Bones.

28:06.490 --> 28:08.700
It's a rhetorical question.

28:12.470 --> 28:13.700
I tried to fight.

28:14.220 --> 28:16.570
It's not your fault.

28:16.940 --> 28:18.320
Was it...

28:22.140 --> 28:23.540
Did she suffer?

28:26.290 --> 28:28.740
It was very quick.

28:32.220 --> 28:34.190
The, uh...

28:36.740 --> 28:39.520
the four of us were planning
on taking a vacation together

28:41.340 --> 28:43.640
after the cookbook came out.

28:45.140 --> 28:46.740
I'm sorry.

28:53.940 --> 28:56.540
I took a second look at Carly's
cervical vertebrae.

28:56.640 --> 28:58.540
The damage matches
an acceleration

28:58.540 --> 29:00.239
flexion-extension neck injury.

29:00.640 --> 29:01.439
Whiplash.

29:01.440 --> 29:02.740
Abby's car stops suddenly,

29:03.740 --> 29:05.240
Carly doesn't have
her seat belt on,

29:05.340 --> 29:07.040
she's propelled forward,

29:07.140 --> 29:08.370
slamming her head
into the dashboard

29:08.380 --> 29:10.280
and injuring her neck.
Exactly.

29:10.900 --> 29:12.580
What about what you found
in the back seat?

29:12.880 --> 29:15.480
The vaginal secretions are
consistent with Carly's DNA.

29:15.990 --> 29:18.180
So she was raped
before she was killed?

29:18.790 --> 29:20.290
Any match on the semen?

29:20.390 --> 29:22.890
I ran the seminal DNA
through CODIS

29:22.990 --> 29:24.790
and the military
database.

29:24.890 --> 29:25.890
I found a match.

29:28.400 --> 29:30.290
Ben Michaelson.

29:30.900 --> 29:32.800
Abby's boyfriend?

29:32.900 --> 29:35.000
It would explain
why he spared Abby.

29:35.010 --> 29:36.880
Carly's husband said Ben
was with the reserves

29:36.990 --> 29:38.390
when Carly was killed.

29:39.210 --> 29:41.390
Wonder how hard is it
to sneak off base?

29:41.850 --> 29:43.450
He wasn't on base.

29:43.450 --> 29:46.450
He was alone in the woods
doing survival training.

29:46.550 --> 29:51.030
He could go, rape and kill Carly,???

29:56.460 --> 29:57.750
You spoke to Captain Gerard?

29:58.820 --> 29:59.819
Why didn't you just talk to me?

29:59.820 --> 30:01.119
Your reserve unit
spent last weekend

30:01.120 --> 30:03.120
reviewing survival skills?
Yeah.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.020
We were each dropped off
at isolated locations,

30:05.350 --> 30:07.730
and given rudimentary
supply and navigation kits.

30:07.740 --> 30:10.000
So basically, you were alone
for two days.

30:10.260 --> 30:12.260
No one to corroborate
your whereabouts.

30:13.850 --> 30:14.450
What are you saying?

30:14.460 --> 30:15.760
You spent two tours in Iraq,

30:15.760 --> 30:17.660
the captain says you were
one of his best men.

30:17.760 --> 30:19.160
Someone as well-trained as you

30:19.160 --> 30:21.260
would have easily been able
to leave your assigned location

30:21.360 --> 30:24.260
and return to your rendezvous
point, with no one the wiser.

30:24.650 --> 30:26.550
But I didn't.
See, at first,

30:26.550 --> 30:27.950
I was wondering,

30:28.050 --> 30:30.740
"Why would a carjacker
kill one of his victims

30:31.890 --> 30:33.990
and let the other
victim stay alive?

30:34.440 --> 30:35.520
That doesn't make sense.
Hey, unless...

30:36.200 --> 30:37.799
maybe there's no carjacker.

30:37.800 --> 30:39.300
What, do you actually
think that I had...

30:39.400 --> 30:41.300
The insurance money
would've given you

30:41.400 --> 30:42.800
over a half million dollars.

30:42.900 --> 30:44.800
You've killed before.
I've been in the service.

30:44.900 --> 30:46.600
Some guys, they
just numb to it.

30:46.700 --> 30:47.300
What? This is insane.

30:47.680 --> 30:49.680
Then again, killing your meal
ticket is one thing,

30:49.780 --> 30:51.080
and then killing
your girlfriend,

30:51.230 --> 30:52.230
that's another.

30:52.330 --> 30:54.030
So, you locked Abby
in the trunk

30:54.480 --> 30:55.980
No!
See, the one thing

30:55.980 --> 30:56.700
I don't understand...

30:57.090 --> 30:58.780
the rape.
Yeah.

30:58.790 --> 30:59.790
What?

30:59.790 --> 31:00.890
We have your DNA,

31:00.990 --> 31:02.390
from the back seat
of the car.

31:03.050 --> 31:04.390
Yours and Carly's.

31:05.250 --> 31:06.750
So what was it, then?

31:07.470 --> 31:09.150
Did you get turned on
thinking about killing her?

31:14.050 --> 31:15.650
I want a lawyer.

31:15.800 --> 31:17.700
I'll bet you do.

31:19.620 --> 31:21.340
You know we'll get him, Bones,
 all right, don't worry.

31:21.720 --> 31:23.120
We do this all the time.

31:23.220 --> 31:24.820
You know, I should
be used to it.

31:25.070 --> 31:26.470
It shouldn't bother me.
No.

31:26.570 --> 31:28.270
It should.

31:30.370 --> 31:33.270
Was she really going to
teach you how to cook?

31:33.370 --> 31:35.170
Yeah.

31:35.170 --> 31:37.270
I've always understood
the basics of cooking,

31:37.370 --> 31:38.370
the physics of it,

31:38.470 --> 31:41.270
but Carly said she
was going to show me

31:41.370 --> 31:43.070
what it was really about.

31:43.170 --> 31:46.570
To her, she said that
it was a way of...

31:46.570 --> 31:48.370
well, she said "loving,"

31:48.370 --> 31:51.270
but then she was
prone to hyperbole.

31:51.270 --> 31:53.870
Well, hey, I mean,
that's what family dinner
is all about, right?

31:55.470 --> 31:58.570
Those are some of my,
uh, my best memories.

31:58.670 --> 32:01.170
I'm not as cold as
everyone thinks, Booth.

32:01.270 --> 32:02.729
Okay, that was a leap.

32:02.730 --> 32:05.230
Just because I think marriage
is an antiquated ritual

32:05.330 --> 32:08.830
doesn't mean that I don't want
Angela and Hodgins to be happy.

32:10.950 --> 32:13.250
I have an appreciation
and a need

32:13.250 --> 32:16.250
for emotional and physical
intercourse just like you.

32:17.800 --> 32:18.279
Yeah.

32:18.280 --> 32:19.379
Sure.
I mean, okay.

32:19.380 --> 32:21.030
Good for you with that.

32:21.580 --> 32:23.580
Did I make you uncomfortable?
No.

32:24.880 --> 32:26.580
Not at all.
I just want to focus...

32:26.680 --> 32:28.880
Let's just focus on the case.

32:29.500 --> 32:32.080
I did make you uncomfortable.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.700
Listen, Abby, I know it's
hard for you to go through

32:36.700 --> 32:39.800
this again, but do you remember
hearing the carjacker's voice?

32:39.980 --> 32:42.000
I must have.

32:42.180 --> 32:43.880
Close your eyes
for me, okay?

32:50.000 --> 32:52.100
I want you to try and
hear that voice again.

32:52.200 --> 32:53.600
Can you do that for me?

32:56.400 --> 32:58.900
Does it sound familiar?

32:59.000 --> 33:00.900
Someone you might know?

33:02.050 --> 33:03.550
What are you saying?

33:03.650 --> 33:04.850
We're just asking,

33:04.950 --> 33:06.550
Abby.
Why?

33:06.650 --> 33:08.850
Ben's story that night...

33:08.950 --> 33:10.450
it might not check out.

33:10.550 --> 33:12.250
What are you talking about?

33:12.350 --> 33:13.750
Ben would n...

33:13.850 --> 33:16.350
We're like a family.
It's not Ben.

33:16.450 --> 33:18.750
Abby, it's just a question
we have to ask.

33:18.850 --> 33:22.450
Do you remember the car
making a sudden stop?

33:23.500 --> 33:24.450
No...

33:24.710 --> 33:27.700
but I-I was unconscious
in the trunk.

33:28.170 --> 33:30.569
Could that be how
she broke her wrist?
Possibly.

33:30.570 --> 33:32.370
Or when she was
dragged or thrown

33:32.470 --> 33:33.970
into the trunk.

33:34.470 --> 33:38.270
Abby, may I have permission to
review your medical records?

33:38.370 --> 33:41.070
They could help us
identify Carly's killer.

33:42.570 --> 33:44.970
But...

33:45.070 --> 33:47.070
do you think it might
really be Ben?

33:48.030 --> 33:50.870
It's just a possibility
we have to pursue, that's all.

33:53.150 --> 33:54.080
Okay.

33:54.140 --> 33:55.340
Thanks.

34:01.740 --> 34:02.840
I did it.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.140
I found the murder weapon.

34:04.240 --> 34:05.940
Or what's left
of it, anyway.

34:06.040 --> 34:08.739
I used the GC Mass Spectrometer
to analyze

34:08.840 --> 34:10.340
the ceramic shards from the car.

34:10.440 --> 34:12.469
The murder weapon
was a ceramic bowl?

34:12.480 --> 34:15.239
It's not just the bowl that's
ceramic, the knife is, too.

34:15.730 --> 34:16.780
Booth mentioned that companies

34:16.929 --> 34:18.429
were sending her
their products to endorse.

34:18.530 --> 34:20.530
A ceramic knife?

34:24.620 --> 34:25.530
Brennan.

34:25.610 --> 34:27.710
The murder weapon was
a ceramic knife.

34:27.810 --> 34:29.010
Hodgins found
the murder weapon.

34:29.250 --> 34:32.550
Zirconium oxide - super sharp,
but easy to shatter.

34:32.650 --> 34:34.750
In this case, you shatter it
into a million pieces,

34:34.850 --> 34:36.350
no one knows it's a knife.

34:36.350 --> 34:37.989
Except me, of course.

34:38.150 --> 34:39.850
Using Angela's program,
I matched

34:39.949 --> 34:42.030
the wounds to the blade.

34:42.080 --> 34:44.179
Either that trunk was packed
with invisible pillows,

34:44.179 --> 34:45.480
or Abby's lying to us.

34:46.320 --> 34:47.418
Why?

34:47.420 --> 34:48.320
Booth?

34:48.420 --> 34:49.420
Yeah, Booth.

34:49.420 --> 34:50.620
Talk to me, squints.

34:50.719 --> 34:52.920
As close to English
as possible.

34:53.020 --> 34:54.820
According
to the medical report,

34:54.920 --> 34:56.020
Abby's got bumps
and bruises,

34:56.120 --> 34:57.920
yes, but, they aren't
at all consistent

34:58.020 --> 35:00.920
with the way she would have been
thrown around in that trunk.

35:01.020 --> 35:03.020
She should have had
more broken bones.

35:03.120 --> 35:05.520
Is there any evidence
of Carly being raped?

35:05.620 --> 35:06.820
None that I found.

35:06.920 --> 35:08.020
Me either.

35:08.650 --> 35:09.520
But...

35:09.740 --> 35:11.870
the wounds on the ribs,

35:11.880 --> 35:15.379
the, the directionality
of impact was left to right.

35:16.080 --> 35:16.880
Of course.

35:16.980 --> 35:17.980
It fits

35:18.080 --> 35:19.070
the scenario I was working out.

35:19.310 --> 35:20.509
So obvious.

35:20.660 --> 35:22.360
English, remember? Okay?

35:22.460 --> 35:24.060
How does Ben figure in all this?

35:24.230 --> 35:25.130
He doesn't.

35:25.470 --> 35:26.470
The injuries fit,

35:26.470 --> 35:28.270
if Abby was driving

35:28.270 --> 35:29.570
when the sudden stop occurred.
Abby?

35:29.670 --> 35:30.570
Yes, Abby.

35:30.570 --> 35:32.270
Why Abby?
Look, I'm Abby.

35:32.370 --> 35:33.170
You're Carly.

35:33.270 --> 35:35.370
Why am I always
the murder victim?
Sit.

35:35.470 --> 35:37.870
Now, I'm sitting to the left.
Zack's always
the murder victim.

35:37.870 --> 35:39.170
Just driving along.

35:39.170 --> 35:41.170
I undo Carly's seat belt,
slam on the brakes.

35:41.270 --> 35:42.670
She goes flying
into the dash.

35:42.950 --> 35:44.050
Go.

35:44.150 --> 35:45.450
Go, fly into the dash.

35:45.550 --> 35:46.950
The concussion

35:46.950 --> 35:47.950
disorients me.

35:48.050 --> 35:49.350
Okay, don't overdo it, sport.

35:49.450 --> 35:51.150
Okay, what are we
missing here?

35:51.150 --> 35:52.350
The Stooges.

35:52.450 --> 35:53.450
Abby's scaphoid

35:53.550 --> 35:55.050
fracture was right
to left,

35:55.050 --> 35:57.150
which means she could have
received that break

35:57.250 --> 35:58.930
while stabbing Carly.

35:58.950 --> 35:59.649
Yes.

36:00.430 --> 36:03.680
I was wearing
a punk bracelet, lots of metal.

36:04.530 --> 36:06.230
That could easily
fracture the scaphoid.

36:06.330 --> 36:08.530
Okay, what,
look, we know
Ahh.

36:08.630 --> 36:10.930
that Ben had sex
with Carly

36:10.930 --> 36:13.430
in the back seat
of that car.

36:13.530 --> 36:15.030
But you didn't find
evidence of rape.

36:15.130 --> 36:17.430
So the sex they had
was consensual.

36:17.530 --> 36:20.030
This part will be left
up to the imagination.

36:20.030 --> 36:21.230
And, since there's no way

36:21.330 --> 36:22.530
to pinpoint the time

36:22.630 --> 36:24.430
the sexual activity
took place...

36:24.430 --> 36:27.330
Ben and Carly were
having an affair.

36:27.330 --> 36:29.030
And they did it
in Abby's car?

36:29.620 --> 36:31.000
No wonder she was pissed.

36:31.050 --> 36:32.450
Abby is in charge of, uh,

36:33.140 --> 36:35.740
of all the equipment Carly
is sent for endorsement,

36:35.840 --> 36:37.740
so she knows about
the knife...

36:38.530 --> 36:41.500
So, Abby kills Carly.

36:41.510 --> 36:41.979
Yes.

36:41.980 --> 36:44.480
Abby kills Carly,
pulls her out of the car.

36:44.730 --> 36:45.729
Oh, boy.
Drags her

36:46.130 --> 36:46.930
into the old stone house.

36:47.490 --> 36:49.090
I don't think this is necessary.

36:49.190 --> 36:50.590
Destroys the murder weapon,

36:50.690 --> 36:52.690
leaving us little tiny shards
to find.

36:52.690 --> 36:54.290
Drives the car
into the ravine,

36:54.390 --> 36:56.290
where she expects
it'll be found quickly...

36:56.290 --> 36:57.690
And locks herself

36:57.790 --> 36:58.890
in the trunk.

36:58.990 --> 37:00.190
Wow.

37:00.290 --> 37:03.690
But there was no hikers
in the area to find her

37:03.790 --> 37:05.990
because she didn't
count on the rain.

37:06.090 --> 37:07.390
Let's go back, Booth.

37:36.050 --> 37:38.340
Carly was my best friend.

37:40.150 --> 37:42.050
She was my
best friend.

38:08.480 --> 38:09.400
Hey, what are you
doing in here?

38:10.170 --> 38:12.300
I thought we were
going for sushi?

38:13.090 --> 38:14.390
It smells like
sushi in here.

38:14.500 --> 38:15.300
Yeah.

38:16.580 --> 38:19.680
Look, Angela,
I've been thinking.

38:20.880 --> 38:23.160
You're not like anyone
I've ever known.

38:23.360 --> 38:25.860
And I don't want that
to change.

38:26.460 --> 38:27.860
So I'm taking you
the way you are.

38:28.420 --> 38:29.560
No strings.

38:30.980 --> 38:32.470
And the smell?

38:32.950 --> 38:34.180
P. phosphoreum.

38:34.660 --> 38:36.860
Ugh, the fish bacteria?

38:36.960 --> 38:37.860
Close your eyes.

38:42.960 --> 38:44.260
Be careful.

38:44.360 --> 38:46.060
Yeah.

38:49.970 --> 38:51.260
Keep 'em closed.

39:01.470 --> 39:03.470
Okay.

39:14.800 --> 39:17.710
Yes.  Yes.

39:19.100 --> 39:20.250
Let's get married.

39:20.500 --> 39:21.500
No.

39:22.000 --> 39:24.000
No, no, no,
this is not a proposal.

39:24.100 --> 39:26.000
I know.

39:26.100 --> 39:28.300
That's why I'm
asking you.

39:29.420 --> 39:30.200
Huh?

39:33.230 --> 39:34.230
What you said here,

39:35.430 --> 39:36.730
that we're enough,

39:38.050 --> 39:39.630
just this,

39:40.750 --> 39:42.500
no pressure for more...

39:44.600 --> 39:46.950
that's all that
I ever wanted.

39:50.580 --> 39:51.600
Hodgins.

39:52.780 --> 39:53.780
Say something.

39:55.220 --> 39:57.000
You're insane.

39:57.460 --> 39:58.990
Is that a yes?

39:59.490 --> 40:00.860
Absolutely.

40:04.740 --> 40:07.440
Okay, okay, um...

40:07.440 --> 40:09.240
All right, how,
how about, uh...
Yeah.

40:09.340 --> 40:11.140
Italy, Italy in,
in the spring.

40:11.140 --> 40:12.000
Um... Umbria.
No.

40:12.270 --> 40:13.469
Right away.

40:13.470 --> 40:14.570
Next week.

40:14.670 --> 40:16.570
We cannot get a wedding
together in a week.

40:16.670 --> 40:17.870
We have to.

40:18.020 --> 40:19.070
One week.

40:19.780 --> 40:21.880
I could change
my mind.

40:21.980 --> 40:22.780
It's up to you.

40:22.850 --> 40:25.250
Okay, yeah, just a small
little thing, then.

40:25.500 --> 40:27.400
No big.

40:28.550 --> 40:30.500
I want a big one.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.600
Totally insane.

40:48.730 --> 40:50.730
You know, you should
let me help.

40:51.730 --> 40:52.730
No.

40:53.650 --> 40:54.730
Cleaning up.

40:55.650 --> 40:56.950
You can do that.
Great.

40:57.050 --> 40:58.950
Wow!

41:00.500 --> 41:02.400
Mac and cheese.

41:02.500 --> 41:04.400
Wow!

41:04.500 --> 41:07.400
Bones, this...
this looks fantastic.

41:07.800 --> 41:09.249
Yeah?

41:09.250 --> 41:10.650
Really?

41:10.750 --> 41:12.750
Wow, I mean...

41:14.810 --> 41:15.279
...you shouldn't have.

41:15.280 --> 41:17.050
I mean, all this work just for me.

41:17.250 --> 41:18.749
What?

41:18.750 --> 41:20.499
No, I mean...

41:20.500 --> 41:22.650
It's wasn't that much.

41:26.290 --> 41:28.400
Mmm.

41:34.050 --> 41:36.290
This is unbelievable.

41:37.150 --> 41:38.200
You like it?

41:38.920 --> 41:40.420
I'd like to be alone with it.

41:43.480 --> 41:46.220
She said I could go
with my instincts,

41:46.240 --> 41:49.279
so I put in a little
fresh ground nutmeg.

41:49.580 --> 41:51.580
Well, she taught you well.

41:54.510 --> 41:56.010
Thanks, Bones.

41:57.010 --> 41:58.500
Yeah, well, you know,

41:58.500 --> 42:00.100
we have to eat, right?

42:00.950 --> 42:05.640
Yeah.???
