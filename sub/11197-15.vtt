Previously on ''Stargate SG-1'';

00:08.360 --> 00:09.960
Colonel Maybourne, sir, NlD.

00:10.080 --> 00:13.360
General Hammond, request permission
to beat the crap out of him.

00:13.480 --> 00:16.640
l'm not gonna hit you, Maybourne.
l'm gonna shoot you.

00:16.760 --> 00:19.320
Why didn't you try to escape
when you were with me?

00:19.400 --> 00:20.640
Come on, Jack.

00:20.760 --> 00:22.640
You trusted me.

00:22.720 --> 00:24.720
You rat bastard

00:24.800 --> 00:28.560
- Hey, take it easy.
- l'm so gonna kick your ass

00:28.640 --> 00:29.760
Gonna turn me in?

00:29.840 --> 00:33.600
Actually, that overwhelming desire
to shoot you has come back.

00:35.000 --> 00:41.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:56.800 --> 00:59.680
l helped myself.
l hope you don't mind.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.560
You're eating my dog.

01:02.680 --> 01:04.360
You want it back?

01:04.480 --> 01:06.840
Would you like a beer to wash it down?

01:06.960 --> 01:08.880
Already got one.

01:09.920 --> 01:11.760
What are you doing here?

01:11.840 --> 01:14.240
l can't drop by a friend's house
for a barbecue?

01:14.360 --> 01:17.320
Well, there's that little treason thing.

01:17.840 --> 01:20.400
Have me arrested.
That's why l'm here.

01:23.240 --> 01:25.280
This is gonna be good, isn't it?

01:26.000 --> 01:29.360
The administration is coming
to the end of its second term.

01:29.480 --> 01:33.280
l was hoping the president might consider
one of those special pardons

01:33.400 --> 01:36.560
they do when one doesn't care
about re-election any more.

01:36.680 --> 01:39.040
Really good.

01:39.160 --> 01:42.840
- l heard what happened with Prometheus.
- What are you talking about?

01:42.960 --> 01:45.840
- Nice delivery.
- Yeah, l gotta work on that a little.

01:45.920 --> 01:51.040
Simmons used the Goa'uld
in Adrian Conrad to hijack the X-303.

01:51.160 --> 01:54.680
He intended to fly to a planet
with a cache of alien weaponry.

01:54.800 --> 01:57.440
l was really broken up
when l heard Simmons died.

01:57.560 --> 01:59.920
Yeah, we all shed a tear.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.240
What you don't know...

02:02.360 --> 02:07.120
is the planet Simmons was intending
to fly to has a Stargate.

02:08.120 --> 02:10.479
- Simmons knew?
- Sure.

02:10.560 --> 02:16.640
lt proved easier to grab the X-303 than
take and hold the SGC just to use the gate.

02:16.760 --> 02:19.520
Oh, the NlD's known about
this planet for a while.

02:19.600 --> 02:22.240
l don't have to explain
why they didn't tell you.

02:22.320 --> 02:25.600
lnstead, they're hoarding a secret
that could save the planet.

02:25.680 --> 02:29.760
Oh, l'm sure they would have come clean
if push came to shove.

02:29.840 --> 02:36.000
But... the address can be yours right now,
for what's behind door number one.

02:36.120 --> 02:38.960
A presidential pardon.

02:39.040 --> 02:42.240
This is the full-price package, Jack.

02:43.080 --> 02:45.120
l wanna go with you on this one.

02:45.240 --> 02:47.360
You must have had a few.

02:47.440 --> 02:50.560
Look, l know you've questioned
my methods in the past,

02:50.680 --> 02:52.880
but we were fighting for the same thing.

02:52.960 --> 02:56.160
l just wanna help make the world safe
from the Goa'uld.

02:56.240 --> 03:01.040
- Nice delivery.
- Well... thanks for the beer.

03:04.480 --> 03:09.200
- Nothing l like more than a good wiener.
- Yes, you are what you eat.

03:11.240 --> 03:14.560
Guess l won't be needing this any more.

03:15.400 --> 03:17.440
What is it?

03:17.560 --> 03:20.880
The address to the planet
with the Ancient weapons.

03:20.960 --> 03:22.800
For God's sake

03:25.880 --> 03:29.600
- Won't do you much good without me.
- Why not?

03:29.720 --> 03:33.120
Simmons also didn't know that
there's an impenetrable doorway

03:33.200 --> 03:36.080
protecting the weapons storage facility.

03:36.160 --> 03:38.160
And l have the key.

04:48.120 --> 04:51.120
(Jonas) Did he say how
he came across this key?

04:51.200 --> 04:52.240
Nope.

04:52.360 --> 04:57.680
lt's doubtful the Pentagon would authorise
Maybourne's presence on a mission.

04:57.760 --> 05:01.200
Should we not explore the planet
to which he provided the address?

05:01.280 --> 05:04.160
He did risk his butt
just to make the proposition.

05:04.280 --> 05:06.440
Maybe we can get through without him.

05:06.520 --> 05:11.200
lf Maybourne thinks it's worth a pardon,
what's on the other side must be good.

05:11.280 --> 05:12.560
Do it.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.600
There's nobody home.

05:45.560 --> 05:47.600
Are you able to translate any of this?

05:47.680 --> 05:51.920
lt's not Ancient, but it's a language
of one of the races of the Ancient Alliance.

05:52.000 --> 05:54.960
- Nox? Asgard?
- Furlings.

05:55.080 --> 05:57.760
Oh, no Not those guys.

05:57.880 --> 05:59.680
- Why?
- Oh, l don't know.

05:59.760 --> 06:05.680
l just can't imagine cute little furry things
making big powerful weapons, that's all.

06:06.160 --> 06:08.320
l don't even know what they look like.

06:08.400 --> 06:11.600
''Furling'' - sounds cute and fuzzy to me.

06:14.520 --> 06:20.240
This section says something like
''Only the righteous may pass.''

06:20.360 --> 06:23.960
(Carter) This looks like where
Maybourne's key would go.

06:24.080 --> 06:29.520
l'm getting energy readings.
There's a power source in this arch.

06:33.000 --> 06:34.640
Here.

06:44.240 --> 06:47.600
Sir. This is definitely something.

06:47.720 --> 06:51.520
- What?
- l don't recognise the technology.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.400
But can you make it work?

07:01.560 --> 07:05.120
General Maybourne's story
checks out so far.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.880
There's a doorway there that
Carter thinks might be a transporter.

07:09.000 --> 07:12.400
But she can't get it to work
without Maybourne's key.

07:12.520 --> 07:14.320
What do you recommend?

07:15.720 --> 07:18.400
- Jack.
- Harry.

07:18.480 --> 07:20.480
l'm trusting you.

07:20.560 --> 07:25.360
You turned yourself in. What happens
from here on out is up to you.

07:30.320 --> 07:33.200
You can remove the cuffs, Airman.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.600
General. Nice to see you again.

07:35.680 --> 07:41.200
Despite your prior transgressions, you've
been willing to help us out recently.

07:41.280 --> 07:44.640
That is why the president is willing
to proceed in this matter.

07:44.760 --> 07:46.640
You're welcome.

07:46.720 --> 07:49.280
Let's see what you've brought.

08:09.200 --> 08:12.000
- When do we leave?
- l leave right now.

08:12.120 --> 08:15.440
- We'll let you know how it turns out.
- Jack

08:16.240 --> 08:19.520
l thought l was pretty clear.
l go with you, or no deal.

08:19.600 --> 08:24.080
Harry, you're under arrest. l've got
the stone and l'm walkin' out that door.

08:24.200 --> 08:26.960
You're not in a strong bargaining position.

08:27.080 --> 08:29.600
The mission will only
be successful if l'm on it.

08:29.680 --> 08:33.360
That stone is useless
without the combination.

08:33.440 --> 08:34.919
How's that?

08:35.000 --> 08:38.880
lt was originally found over 80 years ago
in a pharaoh's tomb in Egypt.

08:38.960 --> 08:43.080
lt was wrapped in a scroll with writing
on it that no linguist could decipher.

08:43.200 --> 08:47.280
l was recently able
to get it translated, though.

08:48.440 --> 08:49.480
By whom?

08:49.560 --> 08:54.640
lt contained instructions for how to use
the stone to access the power of the gods.

08:54.720 --> 08:58.640
That information exists in one place.
Right here.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.760
A deal's a deal.

09:01.840 --> 09:05.600
You wanna go through the door,
l'm gonna be the one who opens it.

09:11.200 --> 09:14.160
There's gotta be more going on here
than he admits to.

09:14.240 --> 09:19.520
Of that l have no doubt, sir. But if he's not
willing to tell us, we can't force him.

09:19.600 --> 09:22.240
As much as l'd like to try.

09:22.360 --> 09:24.480
Now this is more like it.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.520
Shall we?

09:38.120 --> 09:39.240
Yes?

09:39.360 --> 09:42.320
You know the real reason l wanna do this?

09:42.400 --> 09:45.920
l've never actually been through
this thing before.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.200
Really?

09:47.280 --> 09:52.120
l ran the offworld operation from Earth,
using a Goa'uld communicator.

09:52.240 --> 09:54.960
- Nervous?
- Me? No.

09:55.720 --> 09:57.680
l'm just taking a moment.

10:00.480 --> 10:01.600
- Done?
- Yeah.

10:01.720 --> 10:03.680
Good.

10:16.440 --> 10:18.160
- Carter.
- Colonels.

10:18.240 --> 10:20.000
- Major.
- Jonas?

10:20.080 --> 10:24.160
He finished cataloguing the writing
and went to do a sweep with Teal'c.

10:24.280 --> 10:28.160
- He translated everything?
- He needs some reference from the SGC.

10:28.280 --> 10:31.520
- He says it'll take a while.
- Harry.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.600
Right.

10:55.840 --> 10:58.120
- What?
- l'm sure l got it right.

10:59.120 --> 11:00.880
Harry

11:00.960 --> 11:03.120
lt should have worked.

11:04.040 --> 11:06.400
Let me take a look.

11:12.760 --> 11:14.720
God

11:19.920 --> 11:21.840
Harry

11:31.400 --> 11:34.720
- You rotten no-good-for-nothin'...
- Jack

11:34.840 --> 11:37.120
- You son of...
- Jack

12:09.800 --> 12:11.760
Major Carter

12:15.360 --> 12:17.360
What happened?

12:22.560 --> 12:27.360
- Where the hell are we?
- Dammit, why'd you have to do that?

12:30.520 --> 12:34.160
- Where's the zat?
- l don't know. l don't have it.

12:34.280 --> 12:36.560
- Where is it?
- lt's not here

12:36.640 --> 12:39.520
- l guess it didn't come through with us.
- Why not?

12:39.640 --> 12:42.960
How should l know?
Maybe the doorway filters out weapons.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.200
- Goa'uld weapons.
- You listen to me.

12:47.320 --> 12:50.640
l want a straight answer from you.

12:50.760 --> 12:54.640
Since you're here...
l might as well just show ya.

12:57.280 --> 12:59.560
- Hey.
- Come on

13:03.320 --> 13:05.440
l'm getting nowhere here.

13:05.560 --> 13:07.920
Jonas, head back to the SGC.

13:08.000 --> 13:10.240
Ask General Hammond to send up a UAV.

13:10.320 --> 13:17.360
lf O'Neill has activated his tracking device,
we should be able to pinpoint his location.

13:17.440 --> 13:20.880
- You couldn't just let me go.
- You shot me.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.040
Zatted.

13:23.120 --> 13:25.280
- l'm not goin' back, you know.
- Where?

13:25.400 --> 13:28.400
Anywhere. To the Stargate or Earth.

13:29.920 --> 13:33.600
- What are you talkin' about?
- Maybe they got a way to send you back.

13:33.720 --> 13:36.480
No one's supposed to leave.
That's part of the deal.

13:36.560 --> 13:40.480
- Who are you talkin' about?
- The people at the place we're going.

13:40.600 --> 13:45.720
Have you lost your mind? lf you're
suffering, l'll put you out of your misery.

13:45.800 --> 13:50.560
lt's an alien Utopia. According to
the scroll, it's supposed to be paradise.

13:50.640 --> 13:51.600
What?

13:51.720 --> 13:55.680
A long time ago some people
from an advanced alien society...

13:55.760 --> 13:59.760
they chucked it all and they formed
this isolated Utopian community.

13:59.880 --> 14:00.840
(birdsong)

14:00.960 --> 14:04.160
They met and evaluated
people from all over the galaxy

14:04.240 --> 14:06.240
and offered them a chance to join 'em.

14:06.320 --> 14:09.280
The scroll and the stone
were the invitation.

14:09.400 --> 14:13.840
And this is nothing to do with
the weapon Simmons was after?

14:13.960 --> 14:17.040
l figured it was my only way
of getting through the gate.

14:17.120 --> 14:21.520
You know, Harry, it's not that
l can't believe you lied to me again,

14:21.640 --> 14:23.920
it's that you lied to me again

14:24.040 --> 14:27.440
Come on. No one would have
let me through the gate for this.

14:27.520 --> 14:31.280
- Would you have even believed me?
- You're sure this is all worth it?

14:31.360 --> 14:34.720
Couldn't be much worse than
where l've been hiding lately.

14:34.840 --> 14:37.440
They're closing in on me.

14:37.560 --> 14:40.480
Besides, l got nothin' left
on Earth any more.

14:40.680 --> 14:44.560
The money l was to get from selling
the Russian symbiote to Adrian Conrad

14:44.640 --> 14:46.800
was my last shot at making a life on Earth.

14:46.920 --> 14:47.960
(birdsong)

14:48.080 --> 14:51.840
Do something good.
lt turned into a disaster.

14:51.920 --> 14:53.920
Of massive proportion.

14:54.000 --> 14:59.600
l'm tired of runnin'. Why should l when l
can have a chance of retiring in paradise?

14:59.680 --> 15:03.360
l see trees, Harry.
You get that in Colorado.

15:08.480 --> 15:10.480
Ready for launch, sir.

15:10.600 --> 15:12.560
Thank you, Sergeant.

15:14.040 --> 15:17.720
Still nothing from Colonel O'Neill
and Colonel Maybourne, sir.

15:17.840 --> 15:20.240
They've been gone over two hours now.

15:20.360 --> 15:22.320
We're ready to go.

15:22.440 --> 15:24.880
- Sir, l'd like to apologise.
- What for?

15:24.960 --> 15:28.000
l allowed Colonel Maybourne
to take my weapon.

15:28.080 --> 15:31.120
Major, let's just focus
on finding them right now.

15:31.880 --> 15:34.080
Yes, sir.

15:39.080 --> 15:43.360
- You are so lost.
- No. l'm sure this is the right way.

15:43.480 --> 15:46.560
- How's that?
- lt's in this valley.

15:46.640 --> 15:49.280
What's strange is
there's no greeting party.

15:49.400 --> 15:52.240
That's all that's strange about this()

15:52.320 --> 15:57.200
They're supposed to know when someone
uses the gate. l was expecting a welcome.

15:57.320 --> 15:59.360
- Mai tais, leis.
- Well, something.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.440
Cabana boys.

16:01.520 --> 16:06.000
l tell ya, Maybourne,
l don't hear any steel dru...ms.

16:08.960 --> 16:11.320
How old was that invitation?

16:30.480 --> 16:33.360
- There's no one here
- (birdsong)

16:33.440 --> 16:35.440
l noticed that.

17:03.600 --> 17:05.560
Harry?

17:20.119 --> 17:22.079
This in the brochure?

17:38.080 --> 17:41.200
This technology's unlike
anything we've come across.

17:41.280 --> 17:44.160
- l know.
- We've no reference, no way to interface.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.880
l'm working on it, Doctor.

17:46.960 --> 17:48.920
As you should be.

17:49.960 --> 17:51.520
Right.

18:12.560 --> 18:16.240
l guess l can see why
you'd wanna retire here.

18:17.680 --> 18:19.680
Given your choices.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.560
Find anything that
might be a doorway back?

18:25.680 --> 18:27.680
No.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.120
Are you gonna kill me?

18:35.160 --> 18:37.120
l'll sleep on it.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.560
l don't think we're walkin' outta here.

19:22.680 --> 19:25.200
No way of knowin' how far
we were transported.

19:25.280 --> 19:27.720
We could be on
the other side of the planet.

19:27.840 --> 19:30.720
Which is why we survive here
until we're rescued.

19:30.840 --> 19:34.480
Until we're rescued Jack
This place is supposed to be a secret.

19:34.600 --> 19:37.120
The doorway was designed
to keep it that way.

19:37.200 --> 19:40.800
Of course, we have
the only key known to man.

19:42.640 --> 19:47.600
The least you could have done
is eat that before you got here.

19:49.240 --> 19:51.440
(snaps twig)

19:56.800 --> 19:59.680
We're gonna need food
and drinkable water.

19:59.800 --> 20:03.040
- l've been drinkin' the lake straight up.
- That's smart.

20:03.120 --> 20:05.600
- l'm not dead yet.
- lt's early.

20:08.080 --> 20:11.560
Jack... they're never gonna find us.

20:22.480 --> 20:25.360
l covered as much territory
as the UAV's range allows.

20:25.440 --> 20:27.520
Have you received word from the Tok'ra?

20:27.600 --> 20:31.760
Yeah. They didn't know when one of
their operatives would be able to help us.

20:31.880 --> 20:36.320
- What are they doing?
- They have completed their analyses.

20:37.360 --> 20:40.480
Excuse me Where's Colonel O'Neill?

20:40.560 --> 20:44.320
l don't see him, do you?
Did you guys find him while l was gone?

20:44.440 --> 20:49.800
We've been here for a week. We could all
spend the rest of our natural lives

20:49.920 --> 20:52.200
trying to figure out how this thing works.

20:52.280 --> 20:56.080
But you know what? Even if l could
snap my fingers and turn it on,

20:56.200 --> 21:00.400
l doubt whether it would determine
where it sent Colonel O'Neill.

21:00.480 --> 21:02.800
l'd bet anything that the targeting data

21:02.920 --> 21:07.560
is in the artefact that Colonel Maybourne
used to open that doorway.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.400
l say when we're done here

21:14.320 --> 21:16.560
With all due respect, Major,

21:17.080 --> 21:19.520
l will submit my report
to General Hammond.

21:19.640 --> 21:25.520
lf he's prepared to commit to a long-term
analysis project, l'm happy to come back.

21:25.640 --> 21:28.800
But until then, if you'll excuse me...

21:43.840 --> 21:45.600
Anything?

21:45.720 --> 21:48.160
A couple of nibbles.

21:48.240 --> 21:51.120
They're down there, though.

21:51.200 --> 21:55.120
- Sleep OK?
- No. You?

21:55.200 --> 21:57.760
When we first came here
l thought it was quiet.

21:57.880 --> 22:03.000
Now it's like l can't keep the noise out.
lnsects, animals... l keep hearing things.

22:04.160 --> 22:07.520
- They're called birds.
- No, no, no, these are weird sounds.

22:07.600 --> 22:09.600
We're on an alien planet.

22:10.160 --> 22:12.000
Yeah...

22:13.720 --> 22:18.480
Jack, l can't live on this stuff.
Tastes like arugula.

22:18.840 --> 22:22.160
- l hate arugula
- Don't eat it.

22:23.680 --> 22:25.680
We have to eat.

22:25.760 --> 22:30.000
lf you keep standing there, yakkin' away,
l'm not gonna catch anything.

22:32.440 --> 22:34.480
What was that?

22:43.840 --> 22:46.480
That is just wrong on so many levels.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.200
Don't ever do that again.

23:02.280 --> 23:05.440
You're sayin' you don't hear things?

23:05.520 --> 23:06.720
No.

23:06.800 --> 23:11.280
Last night l swear l heard
someone runnin' around out here.

23:11.400 --> 23:14.320
l spent an hour wanderin' around,
tryin' to spot 'em.

23:14.400 --> 23:17.360
- Animals.
- No tracks.

23:17.440 --> 23:20.080
You're losin' your mind.

23:20.200 --> 23:22.480
You don't find things spooky around here?

23:22.600 --> 23:24.560
Made so only by your presence.

23:24.680 --> 23:26.640
Yeah, well...

23:26.720 --> 23:31.200
l'm beginning to wonder if some of
the Utopians might still be alive.

23:31.320 --> 23:35.440
- There's no evidence of that.
- Maybe they're here in another way.

23:35.520 --> 23:37.600
All right, now you are gettin' spooky.

23:37.720 --> 23:40.640
Come on, Jack,
you've seen stranger things.

23:40.760 --> 23:43.040
Other dimensions, planes of existence.

23:43.160 --> 23:46.080
You said it yourself, this is an alien planet.

23:46.200 --> 23:49.360
- So what do you want me to do?
- Give me your nine mil.

23:51.840 --> 23:54.120
- No.
- Come on

23:54.240 --> 23:57.120
You got the P-90.
You sleep with it beside you

23:57.240 --> 24:00.560
- l just wanna be able to protect myself.
- Forget it.

24:00.680 --> 24:04.400
Jack... l want that gun.

24:04.520 --> 24:08.960
Forget it You don't like it here,
deal with it lt's your own damn fault.

24:09.880 --> 24:12.560
- You wouldn't care if l died, would ya?
- What?

24:12.680 --> 24:16.080
Some alien creature comes in
and attacks me in the night,

24:16.160 --> 24:18.240
hauls me out while you're sleeping...

24:18.360 --> 24:20.320
You and l are the only ones here.

24:20.440 --> 24:24.640
Trust me, the only thing you have to be
afraid of around here is me.

24:24.720 --> 24:26.000
Yeah...

24:46.280 --> 24:48.240
(high-pitched birdsong)

25:23.160 --> 25:28.240
A satellite capable of pinpointing O'Neill's
tracking device can cover a greater range.

25:28.320 --> 25:32.960
The Tok'ra could retrieve it later,
so the actual cost would be minimal.

25:33.040 --> 25:37.280
- Compared to what?
- To not getting the satellite back.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.360
What about the delivery system,

25:39.440 --> 25:44.280
and the manpower required to get it
through the gate and then reassemble it?

25:44.400 --> 25:47.840
Sir, l don't think you can place a value
on Colonel O'Neill's life.

25:47.960 --> 25:51.120
- No, but...
- (PA) Unscheduled offworld activation.

25:51.200 --> 25:53.280
We'll continue this later.

25:55.280 --> 25:57.280
(Stargate alarm)

26:00.760 --> 26:03.440
We're receiving a transmission.
Audio only.

26:03.560 --> 26:07.080
This is Jalrow of the Tok'ra.
To whom am l speaking?

26:07.200 --> 26:11.760
General Hammond. Major Carter, Teal'c
and Jonas Quinn are also here.

26:11.840 --> 26:15.840
Major, l received your message
regarding Colonel O'Neill.

26:15.920 --> 26:18.160
Do you have a ship
that can scan a planet?

26:18.240 --> 26:22.960
Yes. l've already taken the opportunity
to fly over the planet in question.

26:23.040 --> 26:25.400
There were no detectable
human life signs.

26:26.000 --> 26:29.440
- Are you sure?
- Quite sure. l'm very sorry.

26:30.560 --> 26:32.640
Thank you. Hammond out.

26:32.720 --> 26:34.800
Jalrow out.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.240
(high-pitched birdsong)

30:00.760 --> 30:02.720
(twig snaps)

30:09.560 --> 30:11.120
Maybourne

30:11.200 --> 30:12.880
(leaves rustling)

31:53.840 --> 31:55.680
Major Carter.

31:55.800 --> 31:58.240
(tearful) This is the women's locker room.

31:58.360 --> 32:02.960
lt appears there is no one else here
but you, and you are fully clothed.

32:03.040 --> 32:05.040
True.

32:13.760 --> 32:15.760
Are you all right, Major Carter?

32:15.840 --> 32:17.840
l'm fine, yeah.

32:20.160 --> 32:22.520
Have you given up hope of finding O'Neill?

32:22.640 --> 32:24.640
Hope? No.

32:26.120 --> 32:29.760
But l'm starting to think Dr Lee is right.

32:29.880 --> 32:33.120
l don't think the doorway is the answer.

32:33.240 --> 32:38.240
lt's been almost a month, Teal'c.
lf there were a way back...

32:40.360 --> 32:42.080
lt just... (sniffles)

32:42.160 --> 32:45.040
lt feels like we just lost Daniel,

32:45.160 --> 32:47.920
and l don't know if l can... (sobs)

33:21.280 --> 33:23.280
Argh Argh

33:24.080 --> 33:26.880
- God
- (animal grunting)

33:32.040 --> 33:34.320
Argh

33:42.280 --> 33:44.240
(gasps of pain)

34:05.760 --> 34:07.840
You shot me

34:07.920 --> 34:10.400
l didn't know you were there.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.600
Stay back

34:15.639 --> 34:17.920
Put that down.

34:20.840 --> 34:24.360
- You wanted to kill me from the start.
- Screw you, Maybourne

34:24.480 --> 34:26.360
l was joking.

34:26.440 --> 34:30.159
- Look what you did to my leg
- l set the trap for the pig.

34:30.280 --> 34:32.880
With a grenade?

34:36.239 --> 34:38.560
Where are you goin'?

34:38.679 --> 34:40.360
Harry

34:40.840 --> 34:43.199
l found somethin'.

34:44.639 --> 34:47.360
Stop eatin' that plant.

34:47.440 --> 34:50.400
lt's messin' with your head, Harry.

34:53.480 --> 34:55.600
Screw you.

35:05.120 --> 35:07.120
Argh

35:28.000 --> 35:32.800
General Hammond says he's considering
new SG-1 leaders. You included, Major.

35:32.920 --> 35:35.520
We know. Do you have anything?

35:35.600 --> 35:39.040
Yeah. Yeah, l was finally able
to come up with some photos

35:39.120 --> 35:42.000
of that artefact
that Maybourne got his hands on.

35:42.080 --> 35:45.640
lt's quite old, making the scroll
a bit difficult to read.

35:45.760 --> 35:51.040
l'm pretty sure that the markings
on the stone are just decoration, but...

35:52.240 --> 35:54.600
Teal'c, wind back that tape.

35:57.040 --> 36:01.600
- Stop. There.
- That was the first day we were there.

36:01.680 --> 36:05.360
lt was invisible after that.
l forgot it was even there.

36:05.480 --> 36:07.840
- What?
- The moon.

36:07.960 --> 36:10.880
The doorway device doesn't use
wormhole technology.

36:10.960 --> 36:13.680
lt wasn't designed
to send you across the galaxy.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.800
We thought they'd been sent
somewhere on the planet,

36:16.920 --> 36:19.640
but they've been sent to that moon.

36:21.360 --> 36:23.520
How do you know that?

36:23.640 --> 36:27.320
The big circle is the planet.
The little circle is the moon.

36:27.440 --> 36:31.360
The line between them
is the path of transportation.

36:42.520 --> 36:44.480
(twig snaps)

36:59.680 --> 37:01.640
Hey

37:03.320 --> 37:05.840
Hey lt was a Goa'uld

37:06.440 --> 37:10.880
He couldn't bring a weapon through
that door, so he brought a plant.

37:12.280 --> 37:14.880
lt's some kind of drug or something.

37:14.960 --> 37:17.200
Maybe it was an experiment.

37:18.240 --> 37:24.720
Maybe it was supposed to get the people
to serve him. l don't know, but it backfired.

37:24.840 --> 37:30.120
These people... they all killed each other
because of that plant.

37:30.880 --> 37:32.880
You're paranoid.

37:34.840 --> 37:39.440
lt's messin' with your head.
l'm not tryin' to kill you.

38:03.760 --> 38:05.760
(gun clicks)

38:12.120 --> 38:14.160
Drop it.

38:18.880 --> 38:20.880
Drop it now...

38:21.000 --> 38:22.960
or l will shoot you.

38:42.280 --> 38:44.960
l'm not tryin' to kill ya, Harry.

38:45.920 --> 38:48.560
You're losing a lot of blood.

38:48.640 --> 38:52.880
lf l don't do something right now,
you're gonna die.

39:14.920 --> 39:16.400
(groans)

39:18.480 --> 39:21.120
Some retirement this turned out to be.

39:21.600 --> 39:23.600
How're ya doin'?

39:24.120 --> 39:26.360
My head's a little clearer.

39:27.840 --> 39:30.000
How long have l been out?

39:30.120 --> 39:32.120
l don't know. A day or so.

39:35.800 --> 39:38.240
l really screwed up, didn't l?

39:38.360 --> 39:40.640
lt's not your fault.

39:40.760 --> 39:43.680
None of the people here
could stop themselves.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.560
Right from the beginning.

39:46.640 --> 39:50.560
Sorry, Jack. l never should
have dragged you into this.

39:51.080 --> 39:54.400
Yes, Harry, you've been a very bad boy.

39:58.880 --> 40:02.480
Hey, don't you die on me now.

40:07.560 --> 40:10.480
- (distant rumbling)
- What difference will it make?

40:15.320 --> 40:18.160
Because we're about to be rescued.

40:22.640 --> 40:26.160
- Oh, that's nice.
- lsn't it?

40:26.640 --> 40:29.360
l can't go back.

40:29.440 --> 40:33.200
l'd rather die here than spend
the rest of my life in jail.

40:33.280 --> 40:37.120
Yeah, um...
l've been givin' that some thought.

40:39.920 --> 40:42.360
l think you suffered enough.

40:42.440 --> 40:45.360
- Hell, l even got to shoot ya.
- Twice.

40:47.640 --> 40:51.880
l think the Tok'ra should be able
to find a nice planet for you.

40:54.000 --> 40:56.120
Thanks, Jack.

40:57.800 --> 41:00.120
Sure, Harry.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.240
Sure.
