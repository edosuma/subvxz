25:21.978 --> 25:24.731
No. Lucky for me,
there's damaged men everywhere.

25:24.731 --> 25:28.193

- You can't-- you can't go.

25:45.752 --> 25:46.836

Okay, that's it. We're gonna go

It's time. It's time now
to finally face her.

25:59.057 --> 26:00.642
Look, I will. I will.

26:00.642 --> 26:03.561
Just not today, yeah, please?

What about Iris?

26:37.178 --> 26:39.097
She can-- I'll-- I'll adopt her.

26:40.724 --> 26:42.851
I'll adopt her. She'll go
to a great fucking school.

26:42.851 --> 26:44.477
And I'll adopt her!

26:44.477 --> 26:46.271

If that's what Iris would like,

26:52.986 --> 26:55.238
I would love that, obviously.
Ask her. Ask her!
