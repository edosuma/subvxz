00:01.805 --> 00:03.763
"Siblings"

00:06.182 --> 00:08.265
Come on, move!
Move!

00:08.300 --> 00:09.474
- (honks horn)
FRANKIE: <i>My worst fears</i>

00:09.509 --> 00:11.020
<i>were about</i>
<i>to be realized.</i>

00:11.032 --> 00:13.818
<i>There was one event I could</i>
<i>not afford to be late for,</i>

00:13.853 --> 00:14.928
<i>and this was it.</i>

00:16.035 --> 00:17.851
Congratulations.

00:17.891 --> 00:20.748
We just elected you chairwoman
of the winter wreath sale.

00:21.661 --> 00:22.785
(applause)

00:22.820 --> 00:25.352
<i>Yep, when you showed up late</i>
<i>for Booster Club,</i>

00:25.433 --> 00:27.302
<i>you paid the price.</i>

00:27.666 --> 00:30.435
The best part is you get to keep
all the wreaths at your place,

00:30.475 --> 00:32.659
so your whole house
will smell amazing.

00:32.881 --> 00:34.006
And it'll last for months,

00:34.066 --> 00:35.923
because you never find
all the needles.

00:38.230 --> 00:39.075
That's the sap.

00:39.420 --> 00:41.725
You'll want to have a lot of
turpentine around the house.

00:41.856 --> 00:44.827
If you cut it with water,
it won't make your palms so raw.

00:45.192 --> 00:48.224
Hey, my girls.
Did you finish your wreaths?

00:48.329 --> 00:50.359
Shelly showed me
how to use a glue gun.

00:50.394 --> 00:52.286
SHELLY: (singsongy) Look what
a great a job she did.

00:52.321 --> 00:53.300
Ooh.

00:53.301 --> 00:53.968
(gasps)

00:54.003 --> 00:55.117
Show your brother.

00:55.603 --> 00:57.102
- Sean!
- Sean!

00:57.204 --> 01:00.497
- Hey, hey, you two!
- Can I have a ride?

01:00.775 --> 01:03.768
No problem.
You too, milkshake.

01:04.045 --> 01:05.731
(girls squeal and laugh)

01:06.715 --> 01:09.106
<i>After all the crap that had</i>
<i>been thrown at me that night,</i>

01:09.141 --> 01:10.641
<i>the sight of</i>
<i>those three kids</i>

01:10.721 --> 01:12.752
<i>lovingly frolicking</i>
<i>around the room</i>

01:13.574 --> 01:15.082
<i>really bugged the hell</i>
<i>out of me.</i>

01:15.547 --> 01:18.123
<i>I didn't really put my finger</i>
<i>on why till I got home.</i>

01:20.085 --> 01:21.321
<i>And then it hit me--</i>

01:21.611 --> 01:24.170
<i>I've never seen my kids</i>
<i>frolic together.</i>

01:24.230 --> 01:26.708
<i>It's like they were three</i>
<i>strangers in a bus station</i>

01:26.747 --> 01:28.179
<i>just waiting</i>
<i>to get out of here.</i>

01:29.029 --> 01:30.737
<i>(chicken clucking)</i>

01:31.159 --> 01:31.713
(sighs)

01:31.792 --> 01:33.084
FRANKIE: <i>Maybe they didn't</i>
<i>hang out together</i>

01:33.119 --> 01:35.076
<i>'cause Sue and Axl</i>
<i>had nothing in common.</i>

01:35.210 --> 01:36.594
So I'm trying out
for wrestlettes,

01:36.646 --> 01:39.883
which is wrestling cheerleaders,
which is actually easier

01:39.932 --> 01:41.431
to get into
than regular cheerleaders

01:41.466 --> 01:43.883
because it's all hot in the gym
where wrestling is,

01:43.963 --> 01:45.950
and there's not really
a crowd to cheer to.

01:46.021 --> 01:47.947
<i>Or maybe it's 'cause</i>
<i>Brick's so much younger.</i>

01:48.490 --> 01:51.232
<i>Or maybe 'cause Brick's</i>
<i>so much... Brick.</i>

01:51.267 --> 01:53.080
Brick,
what are you doing?

01:53.094 --> 01:54.870
It usually copies me,

01:55.282 --> 01:58.922
but sometimes if I look
<i>very</i> carefully...

02:01.123 --> 02:02.234
it doesn't.

02:02.804 --> 02:04.101
Mom!

02:04.572 --> 02:06.553
<i>And when the three of them are</i>
<i>forced to do anything together,</i>

02:06.908 --> 02:08.681
<i>that's when the fun</i>
<i>really starts.</i>

02:08.681 --> 02:10.426
Feels like we've been
driving forever.

02:10.461 --> 02:12.492
Feels like we've been
driving forever.

02:12.527 --> 02:14.226
- Cut it out, Axl.
- Cut it out, Axl.

02:14.261 --> 02:15.370
- That's not funny.
- That's not funny.

02:15.371 --> 02:17.172
- You know, I hate it when you do that!
- You know, I hate it when you do that!

02:17.207 --> 02:19.208
- Why are you so mean?
- Why are you so mean?

02:19.377 --> 02:20.549
Why are you so mean?

02:20.584 --> 02:22.319
- I'm just ignoring you.
- I'm just ignoring you.

02:22.650 --> 02:23.440
I'm just ignoring you.

02:23.491 --> 02:24.873
- Wait, what are you doing?
- Wait, what are you doing?

02:24.908 --> 02:26.518
- Brick, knock it off. That's lame.
- Brick, knock it off. That's lame.

02:26.578 --> 02:28.250
- It doesn't work that way. Quit it!
- It doesn't work that way. Quit it!

02:28.295 --> 02:30.198
- Ugh!
- Ugh!

02:30.233 --> 02:31.294
(sighs)

02:31.694 --> 02:34.024
What is wrong
with you people?

02:34.059 --> 02:37.561
Why are you watching the same
show on three different TVs?

02:38.374 --> 02:40.133
We can't agree
on the volume.

02:42.457 --> 02:45.134
<i>The next morning, Mike met</i>
<i>Aunt Edie down at the quarry.</i>

02:45.169 --> 02:46.851
It's really brutal
this year, Edie.

02:47.148 --> 02:49.841
Most of the guys will get
almost no bonus at all.

02:50.118 --> 02:52.914
<i>Ever since she retired</i>
<i>as a bookkeeper 14 years ago,</i>

02:52.949 --> 02:55.126
<i>Aunt Edie came to</i>
<i>Mike's office every December</i>

02:55.161 --> 02:56.343
<i>to help</i>
<i>close out the books.</i>

02:56.958 --> 02:58.671
I'm hoping we can
massage the numbers

02:58.706 --> 03:00.318
to avoid triggering layoffs,

03:00.319 --> 03:01.884
but it's gonna be tight.

03:08.150 --> 03:09.265
What are you doing
with that?

03:09.604 --> 03:11.346
I gotta plug in Ginny.

03:12.340 --> 03:14.036
(electricity
buzzes and crackles)

03:15.232 --> 03:17.109
You brought Ginny
to the quarry?

03:21.316 --> 03:23.575
Well, the wheelchair
won't fit into the trailer,

03:23.646 --> 03:25.162
and I'm afraid
to leave her home alone

03:25.224 --> 03:28.394
because I think
Ginny is starting to lose it.

03:28.395 --> 03:29.950
Oh, no kidding.
Sorry to hear that.

03:30.356 --> 03:32.062
And then
there's something else.

03:32.260 --> 03:34.601
I think Ginny
is starting to lose it.

03:41.149 --> 03:42.005
(doorbell rings)

03:42.236 --> 03:43.647
Yeah, come in.

03:44.272 --> 03:45.650
Hey, madame chairwoman!

03:45.907 --> 03:48.272
Hey, Nancy.
What's up?

03:48.443 --> 03:50.535
I just came by because
people were complaining

03:50.570 --> 03:51.951
they hadn't
gotten their wreaths yet.

03:51.986 --> 03:53.808
I only brought 'em home
last night!

03:54.082 --> 03:56.419
- You're doing awesome.
- (sighs)

03:56.420 --> 03:58.035
I just set the bar
really high.

03:58.437 --> 03:59.309
(car horn honks)

03:59.344 --> 04:02.373
Oh, those girls.
(chuckles)

04:02.828 --> 04:05.501
I'm taking Dotty to the mall
to get her ears pierced.

04:05.660 --> 04:08.007
She wants to be
just like her sister.

04:08.872 --> 04:09.599
Wow.

04:10.602 --> 04:12.650
They're really close,
aren't they?

04:13.201 --> 04:14.776
Why do you suppose
that is?

04:15.003 --> 04:16.464
Early on,
Joe and I decided

04:16.499 --> 04:18.261
our kids getting along
was a priority,

04:19.005 --> 04:20.392
but it takes
a lot of work.

04:20.906 --> 04:22.747
Damn. I was hoping it
was something

04:22.782 --> 04:24.341
you just crushed
into their cereal.

04:24.461 --> 04:25.313
From the beginning,

04:25.348 --> 04:26.756
when the kids
would get into an argument,

04:26.837 --> 04:29.036
I would get in there
and give them the proper tools

04:29.096 --> 04:31.777
- to resolve things.
- Yeah. Yeah. Sure.

04:31.778 --> 04:33.333
I mean, I do that.

04:33.988 --> 04:35.846
SUE: Give it to me! Stop it!
AXL: Aw. Unh-unh.

04:36.207 --> 04:37.209
Hey, knock it off!

04:37.244 --> 04:38.635
- We're trying to watch TV.
- (arguing continues indistinctly)

04:40.695 --> 04:43.696
- And Mike supports you?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

04:44.032 --> 04:46.092
Hey, you heard your mom.
Knock it off!

04:46.834 --> 04:47.908
(object shatters)

04:48.139 --> 04:49.361
The important thing is

04:49.472 --> 04:51.728
we made sure that
they spent time together--

04:52.159 --> 04:55.662
Family dinners, game nights,
car trips, the obvious things.

04:55.810 --> 04:57.875
Oh, yeah. Um,
those things are obvious.

04:58.408 --> 05:02.103
<i>Dinners, game night, trips.</i>
<i>Dinners, game night...</i>

05:02.755 --> 05:04.322
<i>Damn it!</i>
<i>What was the last one?</i>

05:07.583 --> 05:08.944
Hi. How's it going?

05:10.119 --> 05:11.875
I had lunch
with Stan today.

05:11.963 --> 05:14.867
Corporate want another $10,000
out of the budget. (sighs)

05:15.345 --> 05:17.401
Oh, and I think your Aunt Edie
is losing her mind.

05:17.503 --> 05:18.242
What?

05:18.324 --> 05:21.623
Throughout the day, she called me
"Mickey," "Milton," "Myrtle."

05:22.276 --> 05:24.479
Seriously, I think
she's going, you know, senile.

05:24.555 --> 05:26.155
No, she's not.

05:26.276 --> 05:28.935
All the women in our family get
a little loopy toward the end.

05:29.860 --> 05:32.728
Uh, what are you doing?
We having company or something?

05:32.729 --> 05:35.364
No. I don't know.
I just thought we'd eat in here.

05:35.833 --> 05:37.521
Did the kids
break the big TV?

05:37.751 --> 05:39.134
Hey, kids, get in here!

05:39.135 --> 05:41.868
No, no. Nobody broke the TV.
No, I just thought,

05:41.903 --> 05:44.498
you know, we don't have to eat
with the TV every night.

05:44.569 --> 05:46.364
We could just
sit and talk to each other.

05:46.531 --> 05:48.307
Whoa. Why are there plates
on the table?

05:48.405 --> 05:49.778
Because that's where
we're eating dinner.

05:49.962 --> 05:51.961
What? I don't
want to watch the little TV.

05:52.282 --> 05:53.890
Did someone break
the big TV?

05:53.925 --> 05:55.354
The TVs are fine.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.341
We're just not watching them
until after supper.

05:57.503 --> 06:00.293
Tonight, we're having a family
dinner in here for a change.

06:03.693 --> 06:04.866
(whispers) Dad?

06:06.096 --> 06:09.140
You heard your mother.
Everybody... sit down.

06:10.866 --> 06:11.802
What is the big deal?

06:11.862 --> 06:13.337
We've eaten
at the table before.

06:16.608 --> 06:17.692
I don't have a chair.

06:17.807 --> 06:21.145
<i>Huh. I guess we hadn't</i>
<i>really eaten at the table</i>

06:21.180 --> 06:22.123
<i>since we had Brick.</i>

06:23.046 --> 06:25.110
Not a problem.
We have more chairs outside.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.441
Dad,
why are we doing this?

06:28.595 --> 06:31.313
Uh, maybe your mom and I
need to, uh, talk to you.

06:31.348 --> 06:33.378
- I don't know.
- Are you getting a divorce?

06:33.990 --> 06:35.580
- Let's see how this goes.
- (lawn chair snaps open)

06:38.962 --> 06:39.965
This'll be fun.

06:40.316 --> 06:41.531
You know,
this is actually

06:41.566 --> 06:43.730
how a lot of people
eat dinner every night.

06:43.765 --> 06:45.866
They sit
and they face each other

06:46.157 --> 06:47.122
and they ask
each other questions

06:47.192 --> 06:49.123
about how their day went.
Let's do that.

06:49.474 --> 06:52.541
So what was your high and
what was your low of the day?

06:52.752 --> 06:55.437
- My low is right now.
- Fine. I'll do it.

06:56.152 --> 06:59.107
My high is having dinner
here with my family.

06:59.142 --> 07:01.836
My low is the comment
that Axl just made.

07:02.300 --> 07:03.026
Sue.

07:04.220 --> 07:07.019
My high was that the guy who
sits next to me in science

07:07.054 --> 07:08.645
saw me
in the hallway today

07:08.680 --> 07:10.499
and seemed to sort of
recognize me.

07:10.890 --> 07:11.093
<i>Mm.</i>

07:11.655 --> 07:13.533
My low was that
I was wrong.

07:14.195 --> 07:14.882
He didn't.

07:15.031 --> 07:16.096
(faux sneezes)
<i>Loser!</i>

07:17.100 --> 07:19.427
What did I say about
sneezing words at your sister?

07:19.697 --> 07:20.778
My low is realizing

07:20.813 --> 07:22.465
that my family never bought
a chair for me.

07:22.965 --> 07:25.221
My high is I can eat food
right off the table.

07:27.711 --> 07:30.039
Oh, wait.
I want to change my low.

07:30.074 --> 07:30.926
Okay.
All right, all right.

07:30.961 --> 07:32.586
Let's just forget
highs and lows,

07:32.621 --> 07:34.874
and we'll do
something different. Mm...

07:35.652 --> 07:38.237
Everybody, look at
the person on your left

07:38.589 --> 07:39.773
and say something nice.

07:42.193 --> 07:43.078
You mean well.

07:44.470 --> 07:45.361
Thank you.

07:46.957 --> 07:49.095
Axl? You do Sue.

07:49.322 --> 07:51.107
(groaning)

07:54.408 --> 07:56.448
Your head is basically
the right size for your body.

07:57.207 --> 08:00.052
(squeals) Really?
You're not just saying that?

08:00.346 --> 08:03.855
No, it's everything, like, below
the head that's got the problem.

08:04.278 --> 08:05.192
Shut up!

08:05.227 --> 08:06.712
You know what
shuts people up? TV.

08:06.713 --> 08:09.651
Listen, you kids
are not even trying!

08:10.002 --> 08:12.253
You're brother and sister,
and this is the only relationship

08:12.314 --> 08:14.397
that is going
to last your whole life.

08:14.678 --> 08:15.870
You know, someday,
your dad and I

08:15.928 --> 08:17.849
are not gonna be
around anymore,

08:18.060 --> 08:19.700
and you're only
gonna have each other.

08:19.735 --> 08:20.762
Are you dying?

08:21.958 --> 08:25.229
Oh, my--that's why we're eating
at the table. She's dying!

08:25.264 --> 08:27.430
No! I'm not dying.

08:27.431 --> 08:29.760
Oh, my God!
Dad's dying!

08:29.795 --> 08:31.573
Nobody is dying!

08:31.652 --> 08:33.568
Why can't we all just die now
and get it over with?!

08:33.604 --> 08:34.398
- Mike!
- Axl.

08:34.399 --> 08:34.932
What did I say?

08:35.001 --> 08:36.698
(all shouting at once)

08:37.890 --> 08:39.044
All right, that's it!

08:39.749 --> 08:40.568
That's it.

08:41.342 --> 08:44.208
You three are gonna start
loving each other right now

08:44.390 --> 08:46.522
because that's
what your mother wants!

08:50.360 --> 08:51.404
Right?
Is that what you want?

08:57.236 --> 08:59.575
<i>So despite</i>
<i>my best efforts,</i>

08:59.610 --> 09:01.650
<i>family dinner had wheezed</i>
<i>and choked itself</i>

09:01.685 --> 09:03.503
<i>to a final,</i>
<i>undignified death.</i>

09:04.144 --> 09:05.460
Can we go watch TV now?

09:07.745 --> 09:09.254
Yeah,
throw out your plates.

09:13.700 --> 09:14.931
Nice to have a change.

09:16.000 --> 09:22.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:25.744 --> 09:26.875
So what's up with you?

09:27.412 --> 09:28.762
You going loopy
a little ahead of schedule?

09:29.081 --> 09:31.693
No, I just thought
if we ate dinner together,

09:31.728 --> 09:33.618
it might help the kids
to become friends.

09:34.019 --> 09:36.268
You know, I was talking
to Nancy Donahue today--

09:36.303 --> 09:37.757
Oh, man, here we go.

09:37.938 --> 09:38.377
(sighs)

09:38.412 --> 09:40.545
Every time you talk to that woman,
there's always something.

09:40.546 --> 09:42.062
You run into her,
and the next thing I know,

09:42.153 --> 09:43.786
I can't eat white bread
anymore.

09:43.927 --> 09:45.833
Her kids are nuts
about each other.

09:45.868 --> 09:49.769
You see how they are together.
They're helpful, caring and...

09:50.034 --> 09:52.035
I've seen it.
It's unnatural--all that,

09:52.086 --> 09:53.544
"Can I help you?
You're so pretty."

09:54.039 --> 09:55.089
One of these days,
I swear to God,

09:55.124 --> 09:56.634
there's gonna be
a bloodbath in that house.

09:56.669 --> 09:58.580
I don't know.
I wonder if we've been lazy.

09:58.581 --> 10:00.009
How the hell
have we been lazy?

10:00.094 --> 10:02.307
In the last 15 years,
I think we've sat down twice.

10:02.308 --> 10:04.726
Face it, we have cut
corners as parents.

10:04.761 --> 10:06.552
We're tired.
We've been busy.

10:06.587 --> 10:08.657
We've slacked off
on a lot of the family stuff,

10:08.658 --> 10:10.376
and that's why
our kids aren't close.

10:10.560 --> 10:12.964
All right.
You're this worried about it?

10:12.999 --> 10:14.791
I can help you, but you know
what I'm gonna say.

10:14.826 --> 10:15.764
Oh, God.

10:15.896 --> 10:17.025
Sports!

10:17.467 --> 10:18.729
(sighs) Okay.

10:19.703 --> 10:23.001
Okay, everybody.
This family is heading outside

10:23.262 --> 10:24.461
to play touch football.

10:24.732 --> 10:26.875
Wh--football? Why?

10:26.982 --> 10:28.667
I don't want
to play with her.

10:28.702 --> 10:30.170
But this is
my favorite commercial.

10:30.698 --> 10:31.259
(click)

10:31.294 --> 10:33.178
What did Mom
do to you?

10:33.213 --> 10:34.908
What your mother did to me
is none of your business.

10:34.977 --> 10:36.410
The point is,
brothers and sisters

10:36.471 --> 10:37.881
are supposed
to appreciate each other.

10:37.882 --> 10:41.356
Your Aunt Edie wheels Aunt Ginny
into the quarry every day,

10:41.693 --> 10:42.793
and she doesn't
even know where she is.

10:43.376 --> 10:44.812
That's the kind
of love and support

10:44.871 --> 10:47.179
that I want to start seeing
around here. Let's move now.

10:47.214 --> 10:47.762
(slaps football)

10:53.293 --> 10:55.177
Yo, here's the pitch.
Here's the pitch.

10:55.776 --> 10:58.006
Here's the--no pitch. Okay.
It's a break. Never mind.

10:58.544 --> 10:59.818
Here you go.
Here you go. Here you go.

11:00.243 --> 11:00.903
Here you go.
Throw it!

11:03.418 --> 11:04.688
Okay,
a little indecisive there.

11:06.353 --> 11:06.824
MIKE: Hike!

11:09.625 --> 11:10.185
(exhales deeply)

11:10.397 --> 11:13.064
<i>At first it was a little shaky.</i>
<i>But then...</i>

11:13.224 --> 11:14.664
I have an idea.

11:14.691 --> 11:16.108
Kids versus adults.

11:17.822 --> 11:20.087
All right, so Dad's peripheral
vision is starting to go,

11:20.088 --> 11:22.256
and Mom can't run too fast,
or she'll pee.

11:22.365 --> 11:24.805
So go deep and
to the left. Ready?

11:25.061 --> 11:25.681
ALL: Break!

11:31.117 --> 11:32.432
<i>After a few plays,</i>

11:32.522 --> 11:34.914
- <i>something weird happened.</i>
- Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! I did it!

11:34.949 --> 11:37.378
<i>Those kids were throwing</i>
<i>and chasing and laughing</i>

11:37.413 --> 11:38.780
<i>like a bunch of Donahues.</i>

11:38.781 --> 11:39.984
All right, Sue,
do 10 yards and out.

11:40.035 --> 11:41.215
Brick, 5-yard buttonhook.

11:41.285 --> 11:43.150
I'm gonna roll out right
and find you in the end zone.

11:43.865 --> 11:45.292
I've got a better idea.

11:45.655 --> 11:47.860
- Whoa, whoa!
- Car!

11:48.369 --> 11:49.194
Car, car, car?

11:50.600 --> 11:51.322
Oh, no, no, no, no!

11:51.357 --> 11:53.052
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
- Hey, whoa!

11:53.087 --> 11:54.997
- Oh, wait a minute!
- Oh, no!

11:54.998 --> 11:56.082
Look at you, you, you.

11:56.153 --> 11:57.946
- All right.
- Come on, come on!

11:58.176 --> 11:59.522
- They slick-dogged us.
- Come on!

11:59.569 --> 12:01.137
- Again!
- Yeah, no, no, no.

12:01.138 --> 12:01.663
(Sue laughs)

12:02.433 --> 12:04.233
Oh, boy. All right.

12:05.608 --> 12:07.824
<i>Later, the kids came inside</i>
<i>and had dessert together.</i>

12:07.911 --> 12:09.382
- Then jumped up...
- <i>And to my utter amazement,</i>

12:09.417 --> 12:11.842
<i>Axl didn't pretend</i>
<i>to commit suicide once.</i>

12:12.087 --> 12:14.864
<i>There were no two ways about it.</i>
<i>Mike was on to something.</i>

12:15.213 --> 12:17.446
<i>Suffice it to say,</i>
<i>the kids weren't the only ones</i>

12:17.526 --> 12:19.269
<i>who got along especially well</i>
<i>that night...</i>

12:19.728 --> 12:21.557
<i>which is good,</i>
<i>'cause the next day?</i>

12:21.830 --> 12:23.429
<i>Not so relaxing for Mike.</i>

12:28.466 --> 12:29.200
Hey, guys.

12:32.164 --> 12:32.737
Mike?

12:33.201 --> 12:36.428
We just got our bonus checks,
and we need to talk to you.

12:37.440 --> 12:40.002
Jim has prepared a statement
from all of us.

12:40.037 --> 12:42.222
Oh, man. Look, I know
it's not what you expected,

12:42.301 --> 12:43.841
but you've to understand
what we're going through.

12:43.876 --> 12:45.483
"In these difficult times,

12:45.935 --> 12:49.405
"it is rare to have a boss
who is not only generous

12:49.495 --> 12:51.882
but also is who a boss..."

12:52.825 --> 12:54.110
No, that can't be right.

12:54.511 --> 12:55.601
I told you to proofread it.

12:56.570 --> 12:59.760
Hold on. I was generous?
How generous was I?

12:59.929 --> 13:02.130
Oh, my God!

13:04.945 --> 13:06.616
Mike, we want you
to know

13:06.651 --> 13:08.496
you didn't just give us
money this year.

13:08.969 --> 13:10.828
You gave hope
back to our families.

13:13.210 --> 13:14.443
So what are you gonna do?

13:14.444 --> 13:17.292
I don't know. I guess I gotta
find a way to take back hope

13:17.361 --> 13:19.651
from a bunch of guys
who use dynamite for a living.

13:19.849 --> 13:20.403
AXL: Hey!

13:21.050 --> 13:23.664
- You guys ready for football?
- What's that now?

13:23.665 --> 13:25.875
Come on. Kids versus
the elderly. Let's go!

13:26.046 --> 13:29.432
Oh. Guys, we have both
had really hard days.

13:29.467 --> 13:30.807
Why don't you play
without us?

13:30.917 --> 13:32.940
But it won't be any fun
without you.

13:33.021 --> 13:35.283
<i>Yep,</i>
<i>the kids had such a good time</i>

13:35.365 --> 13:37.088
<i>they wanted to do it</i>
<i>the next night...</i>

13:39.074 --> 13:40.749
<i>and the next night...</i>

13:45.356 --> 13:46.761
<i>and the next night.</i>

13:47.241 --> 13:49.159
<i>Turns out there is</i>
<i>a way to bond your kids</i>

13:49.194 --> 13:50.684
<i>and have tons</i>
<i>of family fun together.</i>

13:50.978 --> 13:53.273
<i>The only trouble is,</i>
<i>it requires spending</i>

13:53.308 --> 13:54.355
<i>a whole lot of time</i>
<i>with them.</i>

13:54.463 --> 13:56.290
All right, let's let them
win quick

13:56.325 --> 13:58.334
and get back in here while
the couch is still warm.

13:58.369 --> 13:59.037
(makes clicking sound)

14:08.004 --> 14:09.992
<i>Mike knew he was gonna</i>
<i>have to bite the bullet</i>

14:10.100 --> 14:11.516
<i>and fire Aunt Edie.</i>

14:15.964 --> 14:16.875
<i>Or was he?</i>

14:26.393 --> 14:31.069
I was just about ready to start
another round of checks.

14:31.199 --> 14:32.488
Listen, Aunt Edie...

14:34.136 --> 14:35.563
There's something
we gotta talk about.

14:36.003 --> 14:38.462
It's not easy. You've been
doing this annual closeout

14:38.497 --> 14:39.757
with me for a long time.

14:39.848 --> 14:41.747
I think the work
keeps me alive.

14:42.309 --> 14:43.229
That's nice.

14:43.372 --> 14:46.611
But you've earned
the right to retire.

14:46.936 --> 14:51.019
Thanks, doll! Should we get
started on those new checks?

14:51.118 --> 14:54.091
No, no checks!
Um, I'm trying to tell you

14:54.126 --> 14:55.676
that we won't be
needing you here anymore.

14:55.711 --> 14:56.747
Oh, I see.

14:57.224 --> 14:59.650
So you want to do the checks
this afternoon then?

15:01.206 --> 15:01.949
No.

15:02.362 --> 15:04.752
No, I don't need you
to write the checks ever.

15:05.199 --> 15:08.452
So from now on, I'll just
be balancing the books?

15:08.669 --> 15:11.534
No. No, no more balancing.
No more checks.

15:11.672 --> 15:14.711
Well, if I'm not writing checks
and not balancing the books,

15:14.751 --> 15:16.599
I won't be working
for you at all.

15:16.600 --> 15:18.799
That's right!
Exactly.

15:18.834 --> 15:21.404
It's time for you
to take Ginny and go home.

15:21.584 --> 15:23.887
Oh, I don't think
you mean that.

15:24.251 --> 15:24.903
Why don't I?

15:24.938 --> 15:27.889
Because if I go home now,
the work will pile up,

15:27.980 --> 15:29.646
and <i>we'll</i> get behind.

15:34.294 --> 15:37.094
Edie,
you're a great old gal.

15:37.095 --> 15:38.824
I think you're cute, too.

15:39.566 --> 15:43.664
Thanks.
But the job here is over.

15:44.620 --> 15:45.479
No more job.

15:46.570 --> 15:47.604
Job done.

15:48.375 --> 15:49.929
I'm letting you go.

15:51.255 --> 15:51.951
Do you get it?

15:52.067 --> 15:56.173
Oh, I get it. I know
what it means to be let go.

15:56.174 --> 15:56.807
You do?

15:57.428 --> 15:59.310
Now if we continue
on this,

15:59.345 --> 16:01.787
we are just never gonna
get these checks done.

16:02.156 --> 16:02.855
(sighs)

16:04.291 --> 16:07.340
- Aunt Edie, you're fired.
- Fired?

16:07.375 --> 16:07.952
Yes.

16:08.176 --> 16:11.159
Oh!
This is very disappointing.

16:11.772 --> 16:14.234
What is? Tell me--tell me what
you think is disappointing.

16:14.269 --> 16:16.244
- That I'm fired!
- Oh!

16:17.118 --> 16:17.824
Thank God.

16:19.139 --> 16:22.110
Well,
should we get started now?

16:25.612 --> 16:28.836
You know, I think
I've actually got those checks

16:28.871 --> 16:30.008
pretty much
under control.

16:30.384 --> 16:34.338
But what I really do
need your help with...

16:35.573 --> 16:38.709
Management
is all over me

16:38.820 --> 16:41.396
about getting
this puzzle put together.

16:42.746 --> 16:44.011
Oh, my.

16:44.798 --> 16:46.145
This is a big one.

16:47.334 --> 16:48.115
Oh.

16:48.835 --> 16:51.676
Look at this.
I found a corner.

16:52.406 --> 16:53.029
Good girl.

17:00.314 --> 17:01.809
They're waiting for us.

17:08.821 --> 17:11.132
(grunts)
Ow. Damn.

17:11.133 --> 17:11.585
What?

17:11.619 --> 17:13.527
(groans) My knee went out
for a second.

17:14.027 --> 17:15.310
I'm gonna have to
sit this one out.

17:16.758 --> 17:20.147
Ohh. Well, Mom,
you're still coming, right?

17:20.461 --> 17:21.778
Yeah.
I'll be right there.

17:22.368 --> 17:23.054
Whew!

17:26.772 --> 17:27.592
Mike.

17:27.840 --> 17:29.055
Think I might have
pulled a ligament.

17:29.810 --> 17:30.709
Better walk this off.

17:33.747 --> 17:34.258
(scoffs)

17:34.293 --> 17:36.573
I can't believe
you're bailing on me.

17:36.608 --> 17:38.178
Football was your idea.

17:38.179 --> 17:39.949
Yep, and the knee
was my idea, too.

17:40.160 --> 17:40.957
I'm on a roll.

17:42.756 --> 17:46.609
Mike, they're not gonna play
if we don't go out there.

17:48.462 --> 17:50.223
Frankie, we can't do this
every day.

17:50.464 --> 17:52.141
It's not our job
to entertain them.

17:52.212 --> 17:54.127
Either they're gonna
get along or they won't.

17:54.128 --> 17:55.201
It's not up to us.

17:55.443 --> 17:57.048
You know what that
sounds like to me?

17:57.771 --> 18:01.032
The excuse of
a lazy, lazy parent.

18:01.442 --> 18:02.304
Well, you know what?

18:03.244 --> 18:05.649
I'm not gonna be lazy.

18:09.932 --> 18:11.699
Mom, you're not
even running.

18:12.010 --> 18:13.605
Well, you've gotta
throw the ball closer.

18:14.750 --> 18:16.474
<i>I wasn't sure</i>
<i>which was making me madder--</i>

18:16.695 --> 18:18.396
<i>that Mike was bailing</i>
<i>on the family</i>

18:18.431 --> 18:21.178
<i>by faking an injury</i>
<i>or that he thought of it first.</i>

18:25.545 --> 18:26.640
Mom, you've gotta run.

18:26.682 --> 18:29.018
<i>Did I?</i>
<i>Did I have to run?</i>

18:29.338 --> 18:31.017
<i>I was sick of</i>
<i>touch football.</i>

18:31.059 --> 18:33.639
<i>How the hell did the Kennedys</i>
<i>do it for so many years?</i>

18:33.640 --> 18:36.706
You know what? Boy, I really
should be making some calls

18:36.741 --> 18:38.544
about those wreaths,
but you kids keep playing.

18:39.079 --> 18:41.166
Forget it.
We're just gonna go watch TV.

18:41.201 --> 18:42.490
Ooh, I call the big TV!

18:42.883 --> 18:46.031
- You always get the big TV!
- No, no, stop!

18:46.144 --> 18:48.493
You can't go inside
just 'cause I'm going inside.

18:48.528 --> 18:49.262
Why not?

18:49.403 --> 18:51.636
Because you gotta stay out here
and bond, damn it.

18:52.330 --> 18:53.061
What? No way!

18:53.096 --> 18:55.690
I'm not gonna play with just
my stupid sister and dork brother.

18:56.478 --> 18:57.831
Hey, I'm not a dork!

18:57.970 --> 18:58.890
(whispers)
<i>Dork.</i>

18:59.126 --> 19:02.377
I was dragging my sorry butt
out here every night

19:02.412 --> 19:04.396
'cause I thought it would help
you kids love each other,

19:04.674 --> 19:07.976
but <i>no,</i> we're right back
to where we started!

19:08.011 --> 19:09.219
Well, you know
what I say?

19:09.558 --> 19:11.903
Love each other,
don't love each other.

19:11.938 --> 19:12.910
I'm done!

19:13.980 --> 19:14.461
Ooh!

19:15.149 --> 19:17.384
Aah! Ohh!

19:20.032 --> 19:21.119
Mom, are you okay?

19:21.120 --> 19:23.090
(nasal voice)
No, it hurts like hell!

19:24.125 --> 19:25.345
(laughing)

19:25.425 --> 19:27.524
<i>So looks like my plan</i>
<i>to bring the kids closer</i>

19:27.605 --> 19:28.836
<i>hadn't worked the way</i>
<i>I wanted.</i>

19:29.057 --> 19:30.562
Come on, guys.
Stop laughing.

19:31.198 --> 19:32.739
- That was awesome, Mom.
- (laughing)

19:32.774 --> 19:36.068
Okay, I'm sorry, Mom,
but that was hilarious.

19:36.136 --> 19:38.444
And when you fell down,
you rolled through dog poo.

19:38.534 --> 19:39.386
(laughing)

19:39.421 --> 19:41.571
<i>But I had given them a story</i>
<i>they were gonna share</i>

19:41.606 --> 19:43.540
<i>and enjoy</i>
<i>long after I was gone.</i>

19:44.178 --> 19:45.702
So then
she spiked the ball,

19:45.737 --> 19:47.790
and it bounced back
right off her face.

19:48.015 --> 19:49.179
(laughs) Off her face?

19:49.762 --> 19:52.546
Yeah, and Axl does
this great impression.

19:52.798 --> 19:55.055
Do it, Axl.
It's really, really funny.

19:55.489 --> 19:57.305
Okay, okay. Well, okay.
So I'm Mom.

19:57.496 --> 19:58.608
So she's out there
and she's got the ball,

19:58.669 --> 20:00.137
"Ohh! Mom..."

20:00.172 --> 20:02.213
<i>Isn't that what bonds kids</i>
<i>after all--</i>

20:02.435 --> 20:04.289
<i>the eye rolling,</i>
<i>the laughing together</i>

20:04.360 --> 20:05.935
<i>over the stupid things</i>
<i>we do?</i>

20:06.367 --> 20:07.303
<i>I think so.</i>

20:08.006 --> 20:11.243
<i>Or maybe that's just the excuse</i>
<i>of a lazy, lazy parent.</i>

20:11.917 --> 20:14.830
<i>Either way,</i>
<i>I'm doing the best I can.</i>

20:15.876 --> 20:17.233
And I know you're
rolling your eyes,

20:17.305 --> 20:19.423
and yes, I'm a horrible mother,
but we have 30 wreaths

20:19.473 --> 20:21.290
to deliver by dinner,
so let's move it.

20:23.669 --> 20:25.307
Oh, wow!

20:25.719 --> 20:27.921
Look how helpful
your kids are.

20:27.956 --> 20:29.957
I've been watching you guys
play touch football.

20:30.379 --> 20:32.246
Wish my kids
got along like that.

20:32.637 --> 20:34.760
How do you do it,
Frankie?

20:35.051 --> 20:37.300
<i>I could have told her the truth</i>
<i>and spared her the pain</i>

20:37.420 --> 20:38.370
<i>I've gone through...</i>

20:38.480 --> 20:39.305
It's a lot of work,

20:39.944 --> 20:42.604
but Mike and I have just always
made family a priority.

20:44.204 --> 20:45.427
Oh, thanks.

20:46.606 --> 20:47.991
(lowers voice)
Just keep walkin'.

20:48.026 --> 20:50.098
Nobody fight till we get
to the next house.
