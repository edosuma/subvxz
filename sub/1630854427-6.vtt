when we first came out here,

16:09.200 --> 16:11.200
But then none of us does but...

16:13.120 --> 16:15.040
as far as we can be bothered,

16:17.200 --> 16:19.000

There's a third stage, it goes latent.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.320
And if Melmont had...

33:32.400 --> 33:34.680
then, then...

33:34.760 --> 33:37.400
it's very possible
he would not have infected you.

33:37.480 --> 33:39.320
I don't think you've got it.

33:39.400 --> 33:40.960
Or your boy.

33:41.040 --> 33:43.680
-How you know?
-Because I have.

33:43.760 --> 33:45.400
He gave it to me.

33:47.120 --> 33:48.480
Before.

33:48.560 --> 33:49.400
[Thin Kelly groans]

33:49.840 --> 33:51.600
You gotta get out of here...

33:51.680 --> 33:54.240
Now. Before he gets here.

33:54.320 --> 33:56.440
-Who?
-Him. '58.

33:57.000 --> 33:59.560
Like he just did to me. [groans]

33:59.640 --> 34:02.600
[suspenseful music playing]

34:09.120 --> 34:10.600
Like he'll do to us.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.160
Now.

34:26.160 --> 34:27.440
The walls are pretty thick.

34:27.520 --> 34:29.640
[horse galloping]

34:29.760 --> 34:32.400
[rumbling]

34:34.520 --> 34:36.480
Couldn't say for the roof.

34:38.160 --> 34:39.400
My boy.

34:40.200 --> 34:42.280
Trouble's here. He's not.

34:43.000 --> 34:47.080
Sir, I'll have that belt from the wall
if you'd be so kind.

34:47.160 --> 34:50.160
[heavy footsteps on the roof]

35:00.320 --> 35:02.400
[gun cocks]

35:04.280 --> 35:06.400
[heavy footsteps, clattering]

35:06.480 --> 35:08.400
[horse whinnying]

35:14.120 --> 35:18.000
[suspenseful music playing]

35:48.640 --> 35:51.840
[guns firing]

36:12.080 --> 36:13.520
[Sheriff screams]

36:13.600 --> 36:16.520
[guns continue firing]

36:21.560 --> 36:23.080
[horse whinnying]

36:23.160 --> 36:25.480
[suspenseful music playing]

36:29.120 --> 36:31.160
-[gun cocks]
-[gunshot]

36:32.400 --> 36:35.440
[suspenseful music playing]

36:39.560 --> 36:42.440
[horse whinnying]

36:56.080 --> 36:56.960
[gunshot]

36:57.320 --> 37:00.120
[suspenseful music playing]

37:13.080 --> 37:14.400
He's gone.

37:14.480 --> 37:16.160
-My boy.
-Where?

37:16.280 --> 37:17.640
[Red] Where Melmont is!

37:17.960 --> 37:19.480
[Martha] Up near Busted!

37:19.560 --> 37:22.080
[suspenseful music playing]

37:35.960 --> 37:37.560
[Martha] So?

37:37.640 --> 37:40.400
Your boy went that way, McClintock this.

37:40.480 --> 37:42.280
You follow your boy,
we'll follow McClintock.

37:42.360 --> 37:43.600
[Cornelia] Look!

37:44.360 --> 37:47.320
[dramatic music playing]

38:02.400 --> 38:03.560
Trafford's manager.

38:08.640 --> 38:09.640
Clay.

38:12.640 --> 38:13.680
Sheriff.

38:13.960 --> 38:16.800
You look like you've had yourself
one hell of a party.

38:16.880 --> 38:18.960
But if it's Alberta you're looking for--

38:19.040 --> 38:20.200
He gone killed them all.

38:21.400 --> 38:22.480
Hmm?

38:22.560 --> 38:23.520
Trafford.

38:24.400 --> 38:25.320
The herd.

38:25.400 --> 38:26.360
Thomas Trafford?

38:27.400 --> 38:30.120
Up country, cloud burst.

38:30.160 --> 38:31.400
Middle of the night.

38:32.080 --> 38:36.040
Flash flood, I mean,
I never seen the like.

38:36.960 --> 38:39.120
Got hisself up a stampede, see.

38:39.560 --> 38:42.280
Crazy Englishman. We tried to save him.

38:42.360 --> 38:47.320
Even got a rope round him one time
but, well, he cut hisself loose.

38:47.960 --> 38:50.320
-I don't underst--
-He drowned, ma'am.

38:51.440 --> 38:52.520
He drowned hisself.

38:56.360 --> 38:57.560
Where is he?

38:57.640 --> 39:00.280
Atlantic, Pacific.

39:00.360 --> 39:02.000
'Pends the way the water went.

39:02.640 --> 39:04.400
We have to look for him.

39:04.480 --> 39:06.360
He ain't exactly looking
to be found, ma'am.

39:06.440 --> 39:08.200
Well, find him, I will.

39:08.320 --> 39:10.040
[Clay] You don't follow.

39:10.120 --> 39:11.920
This is what he wanted.

39:12.000 --> 39:15.600
Thomas Trafford,
he opened up this whole place.

39:15.640 --> 39:18.440
Least it can do
is let him a part of it now.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.040
Few strays left if you're so minded.

39:25.120 --> 39:28.120
[dramatic music playing]

39:35.200 --> 39:36.960
You go whichever way you want.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.200
I go for my boy.

39:38.320 --> 39:41.360
[intense music playing]

39:51.800 --> 39:54.640
[suspenseful music playing]

40:24.320 --> 40:26.800
[horse whinnies]

40:53.320 --> 40:54.440
He's dead.

41:00.360 --> 41:02.160
We gonna part soon.

41:02.200 --> 41:03.520
Why?

41:04.400 --> 41:05.400
No!

41:07.040 --> 41:08.120
Are you angry?

41:10.600 --> 41:12.160
You proved it.

41:12.200 --> 41:13.640
But it ain't your nature.

41:15.800 --> 41:21.280
Sometimes just to see a thing
is enough to let it go.

41:21.360 --> 41:23.360
But I haven't seen him yet.

41:29.480 --> 41:30.480
You're about to.

41:50.120 --> 41:51.840
Here's we all are!

41:52.360 --> 41:53.320
Yes, sir!

41:53.400 --> 41:54.640
-He here?
-[Simon] Oh, yes, sir!

41:55.080 --> 41:56.520
Up yonder.

41:56.600 --> 41:58.080
Been waitin'!

41:58.160 --> 41:59.400
Tooks you some time.

42:00.400 --> 42:02.520
Guessing you got yourselves held up some.

42:06.760 --> 42:08.160
Mojave?

42:09.080 --> 42:10.560
Yes, sir.

42:10.640 --> 42:11.800
You looking to get killed?

42:13.000 --> 42:13.920
Oh, yes, sir.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.520
But now I's ready.

42:15.920 --> 42:17.600
Ticket to heaven.

42:18.440 --> 42:19.400
Huh.

42:29.080 --> 42:30.160
Take us in.

42:30.280 --> 42:33.920
[suspenseful music playing]

43:41.120 --> 43:43.560
Here, nice hat.

43:44.520 --> 43:45.440
There you go.

43:49.280 --> 43:51.240
Good afternoon, Cornelia.

44:00.480 --> 44:01.720
Lovely as ever.

44:03.080 --> 44:05.760
Though a little frayed round the edges,
don't mind me saying.

44:07.040 --> 44:10.600
I mean, if I knew you had this much spunk,

44:12.760 --> 44:14.600
I might've taken you with me.

44:16.120 --> 44:18.360
Save me having to deal
with this little fucker.

44:19.120 --> 44:22.520
He's fucking--
he's come at me with a broken sword!

44:26.200 --> 44:28.000
Thomas is dead.

44:31.800 --> 44:32.880
How?

44:32.960 --> 44:34.280
Flood.

44:34.360 --> 44:35.720
He drowned.

44:41.000 --> 44:42.160
Oh.

44:44.400 --> 44:46.120
And when you gonna tell me bad news?

44:46.200 --> 44:48.920
We might have shared a life together
if it wasn't for you.

44:49.720 --> 44:52.960
Well, then you'd be face down with him,
wouldn't ya? Ey?

44:53.440 --> 44:54.520
[scoffs]

44:56.360 --> 44:58.160
Oh, no. I died years ago.

45:08.440 --> 45:09.680
You killed me.

45:13.080 --> 45:13.960
Why not you?

45:18.040 --> 45:22.680
Well, it came, then it went away.

45:24.120 --> 45:25.840
It's never come back.

45:29.560 --> 45:30.520
Until now.

45:34.120 --> 45:36.960
[stammers] Is that the sprog?

45:43.040 --> 45:44.440
He look like me?

45:49.000 --> 45:51.240
Oh, lucky boy.

45:51.320 --> 45:52.480
Not his spirit.

45:52.800 --> 45:53.680
Can't have it all.

45:56.480 --> 45:58.400
What did-- what d'you do with him?

45:58.480 --> 45:59.520
Did you, uh...

46:03.360 --> 46:05.000
stuff him down the khazi?

46:06.560 --> 46:08.120
I cherished him.

46:10.600 --> 46:11.680
Why?

46:13.560 --> 46:15.240
Because he drew breath.

46:19.040 --> 46:21.000
Because he never gave up.

46:23.440 --> 46:28.960
Because he knew pain
and pleasure and boredom.

46:32.240 --> 46:33.560
And because he suffered.

46:35.760 --> 46:37.760
He taught me to do the same.

46:38.000 --> 46:41.160
Because you were the part
that he was fighting

46:41.240 --> 46:43.800
and I was the half that kept him alive.

46:46.000 --> 46:47.640
Because of all this...

46:53.760 --> 46:56.040
mostly because I was his mother.

47:00.720 --> 47:01.720
Am.

47:12.160 --> 47:15.000
I do remember that the music
was quite pretty.

47:16.480 --> 47:20.120
Hmm, beautiful.

47:25.160 --> 47:26.240
Hmm...

47:33.760 --> 47:34.960
You.

47:37.480 --> 47:38.680
I know you?

47:40.600 --> 47:44.240
Oh, no, that is-- oh, hang on a minute,
that is-- that's spooky.

47:44.360 --> 47:47.680
You were a mulatto thingy:
half savage, half soldier.

47:47.760 --> 47:49.120
You still are.

47:49.200 --> 47:50.760
Weren't me covered in blood.

47:53.120 --> 47:56.080
But it was you watching though,
weren't it?

47:56.160 --> 47:57.280
Ay?

48:03.280 --> 48:04.680
Do that a lot, do ya?

48:06.320 --> 48:07.520
Save your own skin.

48:10.440 --> 48:12.040
You gonna watch her and all?

48:12.960 --> 48:14.440
Looking forward to it.

48:17.920 --> 48:19.160
What about him?

48:22.120 --> 48:24.400
-All set.
-[David] Oooh!

48:25.400 --> 48:27.400
All set. Woah!

48:27.480 --> 48:29.760
Nellie!

48:30.000 --> 48:31.640
Got us a couple of seconds.

48:31.720 --> 48:33.240
Though I should warn you.

48:33.320 --> 48:36.560
I got a man looks out for me
and I wouldn't pick a fight with him.

48:36.640 --> 48:39.520
[suspenseful music playing]

48:45.640 --> 48:47.080
-[David] Oh.
-[gun cocks]

49:00.440 --> 49:03.160
Alright? Eh?

49:06.400 --> 49:07.360
Ey.

49:09.080 --> 49:10.600
You're not gonna kill me, darling?

49:10.680 --> 49:13.640
[suspenseful music playing]

49:22.400 --> 49:24.040
Do you wanna know for why?

49:33.560 --> 49:38.080
'Cause there is a little bit of your boy
walking on this earth.

49:40.680 --> 49:42.040
And you can't kill that.

49:48.120 --> 49:49.120
[gun clicks]

49:49.840 --> 49:51.600
[gunshot]

49:51.680 --> 49:54.720
[dramatic music playing]

49:54.800 --> 49:56.280
[gun cocks]

49:56.600 --> 49:57.960
[gunshot]

50:13.080 --> 50:15.600
You just shot a man in cold blood.

50:17.320 --> 50:18.880
-Where is it?
-She's fine.

50:19.560 --> 50:20.440
I checked.

50:20.520 --> 50:21.920
[Jed Myers] He's alive!

50:28.120 --> 50:30.560
[David wheezing]

50:30.640 --> 50:33.360
Who dunnit?

50:37.520 --> 50:38.760
-[Eli] I did!
-[grunts]

50:38.840 --> 50:42.040
[dramatic music playing]

50:57.120 --> 50:59.600
[Sheriff Robert] Now I'm gonna have
to arrest you both.

51:02.440 --> 51:03.440
[Eli] No.

51:04.680 --> 51:05.800
Just me.

51:07.480 --> 51:09.120
[Martha] Goddamn!

51:09.200 --> 51:10.960
[groaning]

51:16.120 --> 51:17.280
[Cornelia] I couldn't do it.

51:20.400 --> 51:22.000
You didn't need to.

51:22.080 --> 51:24.240
[Sheriff Robert] All right,
you, I'm gonna take you in.

51:24.320 --> 51:25.240
[Cornelia] Why?

51:25.320 --> 51:27.960
His workers come up here,
find him, there'll be a lynching.

51:28.040 --> 51:29.560
No question. Out of my hands.

51:29.640 --> 51:31.240
Clear out as soon as she can.

51:31.320 --> 51:32.520
But not with us.

51:32.600 --> 51:33.880
No, no!

51:33.960 --> 51:35.360
[Sheriff Robert] We're safer separate.

51:35.440 --> 51:36.520
You understand?

51:37.640 --> 51:38.920
[sighs]

51:39.000 --> 51:41.320
I want these two with us.

51:41.400 --> 51:42.520
You want to live?

51:43.280 --> 51:44.400
Do what I say!

51:46.160 --> 51:48.080
All of ya! Now!

52:09.280 --> 52:11.000
How do you think this is gonna go?

52:12.200 --> 52:14.360
Can never say, 'til it has.

52:15.120 --> 52:16.280
I can.

52:17.600 --> 52:19.440
They're gonna hang you anyway.

52:19.520 --> 52:21.720
Right in front of his store.

52:21.800 --> 52:23.160
Is that illegal, Sheriff?

52:23.240 --> 52:25.520
You know what's beneath that street?

52:26.000 --> 52:27.160
Got a fair idea.

52:27.240 --> 52:28.200
[Sheriff Robert] History.

52:28.280 --> 52:30.600
And that's where they're going to keep it.

52:30.680 --> 52:34.680
Yep, that's how this story's gonna end.

52:36.240 --> 52:38.240
But not for you.

52:51.640 --> 52:53.680
This is how it'll be for you:

52:53.760 --> 52:56.080
I was up here looking for that boy

52:56.160 --> 52:58.200
and I came across Melmont

52:58.280 --> 53:01.280
in some big argument with this fella.

53:02.560 --> 53:04.440
I shot him.

53:04.520 --> 53:08.320
But not before he got to stick
a cavalry sabre

53:08.400 --> 53:12.000
straight into our hero's heart.

53:12.080 --> 53:14.240
That's the way it'll be.

53:15.360 --> 53:19.600
And the only one way to make that work
is for you to disappear.

53:20.640 --> 53:25.560
Now. Forever. And never look back.

53:27.560 --> 53:29.680
The woman I came in with...

53:29.760 --> 53:32.280
She's got her own journey to face...

53:33.560 --> 53:35.080
wouldn't you say?

53:37.240 --> 53:39.040
Now this one's done.

53:39.120 --> 53:42.320
[dramatic music playing]

53:54.440 --> 53:57.000
There's only one way out
and that's not it.

53:57.080 --> 53:59.120
[dramatic music playing]

54:02.040 --> 54:03.840
[horse neighing]

54:20.760 --> 54:22.240
[Cornelia] Eli!

54:26.320 --> 54:28.000
Eli!

54:38.040 --> 54:39.360
Oh...

54:41.080 --> 54:42.640
[Cornelia] Eli!

54:53.200 --> 54:54.480
What's happening?

54:54.720 --> 54:57.520
[Sheriff Robert] This can't be!
You shouldn't be here!

54:58.880 --> 55:01.440
What? What, can't?

55:01.800 --> 55:02.920
[Eli] "Soon..."

55:05.200 --> 55:06.240

55:06.320 --> 55:07.440
No!

55:08.480 --> 55:11.720
No, no, because look! Look.

Time to go home.

Back to the Loup.

56:32.880 --> 56:34.320
Why?

56:36.120 --> 56:40.440
Sometimes you gotta see a thing,
just to let it go.

56:41.000 --> 56:44.680
I can't let you go.

56:44.760 --> 56:46.600
I can't.

56:51.240 --> 56:52.640

But that star of yours...

57:14.120 --> 57:15.040

57:21.960 --> 57:22.880

You've got to go!

58:48.480 --> 58:50.120
[Cornelia] Eli!

59:07.960 --> 59:09.360
It's wheat seed.

59:12.640 --> 59:14.040
The best.

59:16.240 --> 59:17.600
For that day.

59:37.680 --> 59:38.960

In England.

1:03:38.240 --> 1:03:39.800
So strange.

1:03:40.680 --> 1:03:42.080
Do you remember me?

1:03:42.160 --> 1:03:43.240
Yes.

1:03:43.320 --> 1:03:44.920
[Cornelia] I thought maybe, not.

1:03:45.000 --> 1:03:45.840
I do.

1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:50.480
[Cornelia] It sounds like a dream.

1:03:50.560 --> 1:03:52.040
I've seen the world!

1:03:52.120 --> 1:03:53.880
