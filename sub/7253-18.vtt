00:01.877 --> 00:03.671
- Luke, will you marry me?

00:01.877 --> 00:03.671
- Yes.

00:03.712 --> 00:05.673
- My father owns the place.

00:03.712 --> 00:05.673
- Your father?

00:05.714 --> 00:06.966
My biological father.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.759
- When did you find out?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.759
- Two months ago.

00:08.801 --> 00:10.803
That's a hell of a long time

00:08.801 --> 00:10.803
to go without telling me.

00:10.845 --> 00:13.305
- I'm sorry.

00:10.845 --> 00:13.305
- It's all happening too fast.

00:13.347 --> 00:14.431
You know, we could

00:13.347 --> 00:14.431
just postpone.

00:14.473 --> 00:16.057
Postpone the wedding?

00:16.099 --> 00:18.059
My parents are looking

00:16.099 --> 00:18.059
for a place in Stars Hollow?

00:18.101 --> 00:20.061
All I know is they're looking,

00:18.101 --> 00:20.061
they're pricing.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.355
But why?

00:21.396 --> 00:22.690
Because Luke and I

00:21.396 --> 00:22.690
are getting married

00:22.731 --> 00:24.358
and I guess they figure

00:22.731 --> 00:24.358
we'll be having kids

00:24.399 --> 00:26.735
and they want to be near me

00:24.399 --> 00:26.735
when that happens, really near.

00:26.777 --> 00:27.945
You in the market

00:26.777 --> 00:27.945

00:27.987 --> 00:29.321
That's for Luke.

00:29.363 --> 00:30.656
He is going to chaperone

00:30.698 --> 00:32.199
April's field trip

00:30.698 --> 00:32.199
to Philadelphia.

00:32.240 --> 00:34.743
So, how long have

00:32.240 --> 00:34.743
you two known each other?

00:34.785 --> 00:36.119
- A while.

00:34.785 --> 00:36.119
- You date?

00:36.161 --> 00:37.579
Yes, we used to date.

Were you two

You didn't just cheat on me,

00:46.087 --> 00:48.924
you<i> really</i> cheated on me.

00:48.966 --> 00:49.967
I didn't cheat on you.

00:50.009 --> 00:51.552
Oh, so you didn't

No, I did.

00:51.593 --> 00:52.970
But we were broken up.

00:53.012 --> 00:54.638
I understand

00:53.012 --> 00:54.638
that you're upset

00:54.680 --> 00:56.473
and I really wish you

hadn't found out like that

00:56.515 --> 00:57.683
but, Rory, I love you.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.518
'You know that I love you.'

01:01.478 --> 01:03.522
put it behind you

Weird, weird dream.

you step into a boxing ring

01:14.825 --> 01:16.493
- 'Weirder, scarier.'

01:14.825 --> 01:16.493
- Let's hear it.

01:16.535 --> 01:18.161
Well, I was home

01:16.535 --> 01:18.161
and I was finishing up

01:18.203 --> 01:20.831
my usual morning routine,

01:18.203 --> 01:20.831
you know, coffee, shower.

01:20.873 --> 01:22.457
and then, picture this,

01:20.873 --> 01:22.457
very weird

01:22.499 --> 01:24.710
I take Paul Anka

01:22.499 --> 01:24.710

01:30.591 --> 01:32.551
-<i> Very pleasant, natty dresser.</i>

01:32.593 --> 01:34.678
Then suddenly, he sees

01:32.593 --> 01:34.678
something, a cat or something

01:34.720 --> 01:36.137
and darts right

01:34.720 --> 01:36.137
into the middle of the street.

01:36.179 --> 01:38.515
- The real Paul Anka?

01:36.179 --> 01:38.515
- The dog Paul Anka.

<i>(Lorelai)</i>

01:38.557 --> 01:40.768

<i>but he completely ignores me</i>

01:40.809 --> 01:42.227
<i>and runs right</i>

01:42.269 --> 01:43.729
You know, you didn't

01:42.269 --> 01:43.729
train him well enough.

01:43.771 --> 01:45.439
Too much affection,

01:43.771 --> 01:45.439
not enough discipline.

01:45.480 --> 01:46.774
So, I go

01:45.480 --> 01:46.774
after him into Doose's

01:46.815 --> 01:48.316
and apparently

01:46.815 --> 01:48.316
he's got a job there.

01:48.358 --> 01:51.319
- The dog Paul Anka?

01:48.358 --> 01:51.319
-<i> The real Paul Anka.</i>

01:54.698 --> 01:56.408
You have the cucumber eye.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.493

01:56.450 --> 01:58.493
approaching Luke's apartment

01:58.535 --> 02:00.079

04:52.084 --> 04:53.418
It's a field trip

04:52.084 --> 04:53.418
with a bunch of 12-year-olds.

04:53.460 --> 04:54.461
I'm not gonna

04:53.460 --> 04:54.461
need nicer stuff.

04:54.502 --> 04:55.837
Just in case.

04:55.879 --> 04:57.631
It's ten days of diners

04:55.879 --> 04:57.631
and fast food.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.466
Nothing requiring

04:57.672 --> 04:59.466
slacks or jackets.

04:59.507 --> 05:01.676
See, that's what the phrase

04:59.507 --> 05:01.676
"just in case" covers

05:01.718 --> 05:04.138
the times you think you've

05:01.718 --> 05:04.138
anticipated every possible need.

05:04.179 --> 05:05.806
Alright. I'll bring it.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.891
You know, there was a flash

05:05.847 --> 05:07.891
flood in El Salvador last night.

05:07.933 --> 05:09.935
No, my Salvadoran paper

05:07.933 --> 05:09.935
didn't come today.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.311
They didn't see it coming.

05:11.352 --> 05:12.771
That's the flash part

05:11.352 --> 05:12.771
of flash flood.

05:12.813 --> 05:14.231
So, what do I do if I see

05:14.273 --> 05:15.941
a flash flood coming

05:14.273 --> 05:15.941
straight at the diner?

05:15.983 --> 05:18.277
Make sure all the customers

05:15.983 --> 05:18.277
have settled up.

05:18.318 --> 05:21.280
It's all a big joke

05:18.318 --> 05:21.280
to you.

05:21.321 --> 05:22.363
So, you're

05:21.321 --> 05:22.363
taking this, huh?

05:22.405 --> 05:23.657
You know, the old one's a mess.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.075
- Hmm.

05:23.698 --> 05:25.075
- You don't think I should?

05:25.117 --> 05:27.327
No, it's just you think

05:25.117 --> 05:27.327
it's sturdy enough?

05:27.368 --> 05:28.745
Yeah, I think

05:27.368 --> 05:28.745
it should be.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.455
Well, it's always best

05:28.787 --> 05:30.455
to take something

05:30.497 --> 05:33.333
that a gorilla could jump up

05:30.497 --> 05:33.333
and down on and not wreck.

05:33.374 --> 05:35.252
I don't think

05:33.374 --> 05:35.252
a gorilla has tested it

05:35.294 --> 05:37.545
but if it busts, I'll just

05:35.294 --> 05:37.545
pick up something on the road.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.547
- That'll work.

05:37.587 --> 05:39.547
- Alright, I should get going.

05:39.589 --> 05:41.340
Anna's stuck at the house

05:39.589 --> 05:41.340
until I pick up April.

05:41.382 --> 05:42.843
Well, let's get you

05:41.382 --> 05:42.843
on the road.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.511
It's good timing, too.

05:42.884 --> 05:44.511
Caesar's in the back.

05:44.552 --> 05:46.305
Sure you don't want

05:44.552 --> 05:46.305
to reconsider my offer?

05:46.345 --> 05:48.223
I've got a hairnet on me,

05:46.345 --> 05:48.223
so I can start immediately.

05:48.265 --> 05:49.516
Offer declined.

05:49.557 --> 05:52.311
- You take that. I'll take this.

05:49.557 --> 05:52.311
- Perfect.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.148
Oh. Oops.

06:02.237 --> 06:04.614
What was that?

06:02.237 --> 06:04.614
Wait! Wait!

06:04.656 --> 06:06.533
- He's unstoppable.

06:04.656 --> 06:06.533
- It's cute.

06:06.574 --> 06:08.202
We need to confirm

06:06.574 --> 06:08.202
the itinerary.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.871
As we've done a 1,000 times

06:08.243 --> 06:10.871
before, sure. Let's confirm it.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.706
Today's the kids'

06:10.912 --> 06:12.706
math contest in Newark.

06:12.747 --> 06:14.875
In my day, you learned two plus

06:12.747 --> 06:14.875
two and you stayed home.

06:14.916 --> 06:16.375
Today they got contests

06:14.916 --> 06:16.375
and go on the road

06:16.417 --> 06:17.836
like they're

06:16.417 --> 06:17.836
Metallica or something.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.378
And then tomorrow night's

06:17.878 --> 06:19.378
Philadelphia.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.048
Did I tell you

06:19.420 --> 06:21.048
we were dropping in on Jess?

06:21.089 --> 06:23.050
- Jess? No.

06:21.089 --> 06:23.050
- Yeah, this place he works.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.510
You know, they put out this zine

06:23.091 --> 06:25.510
and books and whatever else.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.137
They're having an open house.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.137
I'm taking April.

06:27.179 --> 06:28.972
It'll give jess a chance

06:27.179 --> 06:28.972
to meet his little cousin.

06:29.014 --> 06:30.557
Oh, sounds great.

06:30.598 --> 06:32.226
- So, anywhere in the back?

06:30.598 --> 06:32.226
- Anywhere is fine.

06:32.267 --> 06:34.144
'Hey, day six,

06:32.267 --> 06:34.144
if your cell dies'

06:34.186 --> 06:36.063
is there a phone in Gettysburg

06:34.186 --> 06:36.063
I could reach you at?

06:36.104 --> 06:37.898
Yeah, the one Grant used

06:36.104 --> 06:37.898
to call Lincoln.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.358
- Number's in the book.

06:37.939 --> 06:39.358
- Oh, good.

06:39.398 --> 06:41.484
He's a funnyman today.

06:39.398 --> 06:41.484
He's Jerry Lewis.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.278
Caesar, calm down.

06:41.526 --> 06:43.278
You're gonna do great.

06:43.320 --> 06:44.571
You're the best cook

06:43.320 --> 06:44.571
Luke's ever had.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.405
You so make better pancakes

06:44.612 --> 06:46.405
than he does.

06:46.447 --> 06:47.532
- True.

06:46.447 --> 06:47.532
- No, he doesn't.

06:47.574 --> 06:48.950
You just have

06:47.574 --> 06:48.950
to be confident.

06:48.992 --> 06:50.827
It's just that

06:48.992 --> 06:50.827
when I'm working the grill

06:50.869 --> 06:52.704
sometimes I get a locked elbow,

06:50.869 --> 06:52.704
and Luke's the only one

06:52.746 --> 06:54.331
who knows how to rub it

06:52.746 --> 06:54.331
to get it workin' again.

06:54.373 --> 06:56.083
- He rubs your elbow?

06:54.373 --> 06:56.083
- It's like a sports injury.

06:56.124 --> 06:57.458
It's okay, if it's sports..

06:57.500 --> 06:58.919
You wanna step back

06:57.500 --> 06:58.919
about three feet

06:58.960 --> 06:59.961
so I can say goodbye

06:58.960 --> 06:59.961
to my girl?

07:00.003 --> 07:02.089
Fine.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.007
- You gonna miss me?

07:02.130 --> 07:04.007
- Especially, if my elbow hurts.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.717
- I'm gonna call you a lot.

07:04.049 --> 07:05.717
- Same here.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.928
You know, I was happy

07:05.759 --> 07:07.928
when she asked me

07:07.969 --> 07:10.222
but now it just struck me,

07:07.969 --> 07:10.222
I'm gonna spend ten days

07:10.264 --> 07:11.431
with a bus full of teenagers.

07:11.472 --> 07:13.558
I think you're ready.

07:13.600 --> 07:14.768
Thanks for seeing me off.

07:14.809 --> 07:15.977
Your pancakes are

07:14.809 --> 07:15.977
better, by the way.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.687
- Thanks.

07:16.019 --> 07:17.687
- Don't worry, Luke.

07:17.729 --> 07:19.106
Just a momentary panic.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.691
- I'm gonna be fine, I promise.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.691
- Good.

07:21.733 --> 07:24.278
Now go back in there

07:21.733 --> 07:24.278
and reclaim your turf.

07:24.319 --> 07:25.946
Reclaim my turf?

07:28.073 --> 07:29.241
Kirk!

07:33.870 --> 07:35.496
What you doing, Kirk?

07:33.870 --> 07:35.496
You don't work here.

07:39.418 --> 07:40.710
That's my favorite hairnet.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.845
I'm bad with names,

07:48.635 --> 07:50.845
so, help me with the names.

07:50.887 --> 07:51.888
You ever use

07:50.887 --> 07:51.888
mnemonic devices?

07:51.930 --> 07:53.807
Uh, maybe.

07:53.848 --> 07:55.434
They help you

07:53.848 --> 07:55.434
remember things.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.602
Uh, like Curtis Shuran.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.602
he's from Kurdistan.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.271
- Really?

07:57.644 --> 07:59.271
- No. He's from Detroit.

07:59.313 --> 08:02.316
- That's a mnemonic device.

07:59.313 --> 08:02.316
- Curtis Shuran from Kurdistan.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.443
Jamie Alvarado

08:02.357 --> 08:04.443
likes to try avocados.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.027
and Meg Shatsworth,

08:04.484 --> 08:06.027
Haywood's Fatsworth.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.989
Okay, Shatsworth, Fatworth.

08:06.069 --> 08:08.989
Alvarado, avocado..

08:09.030 --> 08:10.407
And those are

08:09.030 --> 08:10.407
your fellow grups.

08:10.449 --> 08:11.825
- The what?

08:10.449 --> 08:11.825
- Grown-ups.

08:11.866 --> 08:12.951
You never saw

08:11.866 --> 08:12.951
the original "Star Trek?"

08:12.993 --> 08:14.786
Oh, yes! Grups. Yes, I did.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.205
The one in the cords is

08:14.828 --> 08:17.205
our math teacher, Mr. Munster.

08:17.247 --> 08:18.957
Uh, good guy,

08:17.247 --> 08:18.957
he's a little nerdy

08:18.999 --> 08:20.500
likes to wow us with his

08:18.999 --> 08:20.500
Chris Rock impersonation.

08:20.541 --> 08:22.210
It's borderline racist.

08:22.252 --> 08:24.212
Well, let's leave the bags here,

08:22.252 --> 08:24.212
get the lay of the land first.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.630
Well, this is

08:24.254 --> 08:25.630
pretty much the land.

08:25.672 --> 08:27.299
Well, there must be

08:25.672 --> 08:27.299
some kind of check-in point

08:27.341 --> 08:29.426
and protocol to follow,

08:27.341 --> 08:29.426
so just stick with me, okay?

08:29.468 --> 08:31.261
Or you could just run

08:29.468 --> 08:31.261
on the bus. That's really good..

08:31.303 --> 08:32.637
Hello, there.

08:31.303 --> 08:32.637
You our pilot?

08:32.679 --> 08:34.139
- Uh, your what?

08:32.679 --> 08:34.139
- Are you the driver?

08:34.181 --> 08:36.599
[laughs]

08:34.181 --> 08:36.599
Me? No. I'm Luke Danes.

08:36.641 --> 08:39.060
Oh, you're Luke Danes. Sorry.

08:36.641 --> 08:39.060
We thought you were our driver.

08:39.102 --> 08:40.895
No, no, sorry, I, uh

08:40.937 --> 08:42.272
you know, I have

08:40.937 --> 08:42.272
nicer clothes than this.

08:42.314 --> 08:44.024
I won't always

08:42.314 --> 08:44.024
be wearing these.

08:44.065 --> 08:47.027
That's okay. I'm Earl Stepton.

08:44.065 --> 08:47.027
This is Kelly Turlington.

08:47.068 --> 08:48.611
And you probably know

08:47.068 --> 08:48.611
Roy Munster.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.571
- Your daughter's teacher.

08:48.653 --> 08:50.571
- Actually, no.

08:50.613 --> 08:54.701
I'm April's new father, I mean,

08:50.613 --> 08:54.701
not new, but new to her so, hey.

08:54.742 --> 08:55.869
She's a bright one,

08:54.742 --> 08:55.869
your daughter.

08:55.910 --> 08:57.120
Go figure.

08:57.162 --> 08:58.497
- Hey, Luke!

08:57.162 --> 08:58.497
- Yeah?

08:58.538 --> 09:00.207
Some people in here

08:58.538 --> 09:00.207
are wondering who you are.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.126
- Go ahead and tell them.

09:00.248 --> 09:03.126
- That's Luke.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.837
- Here's the detailed itinerary.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.837
- Lunch stops, snack stops.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.630
- Wander time, exploring time.

09:05.879 --> 09:07.630
- TV time.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.299
Porn will be pre-blocked

09:07.672 --> 09:09.299
at all our lodgings.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.717
Okay. So, no porn.

09:10.758 --> 09:12.219
Study breaks,

09:10.758 --> 09:12.219
check-in with parents.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.928
- Bedtime hours.

09:12.260 --> 09:13.928
- So, we go to bed at 9:00?

09:13.970 --> 09:15.180
The kids do.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.180
You don't have to.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.432
- Right, but I can?

09:15.222 --> 09:17.432
- Sure.

09:17.474 --> 09:19.017
Shall we get on board

09:17.474 --> 09:19.017
so they don't leave without us?

09:19.059 --> 09:20.394
Well, I still

09:19.059 --> 09:20.394
have my bags.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.562
- Okay. See you on the bus.

09:20.435 --> 09:22.562
- See you.

09:22.603 --> 09:24.898
Kelly Turlington

09:22.603 --> 09:24.898
from Burlington.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.484
Uh, Roy Munster's a punster.

09:28.943 --> 09:30.278
Hey, you.

09:30.320 --> 09:32.072
- 'Hey.'

09:30.320 --> 09:32.072
- You get in late last night?

09:32.113 --> 09:34.074
- I was studying.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.074
- Hmm.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.701
- Missed my class this morning.

09:34.115 --> 09:36.701
- Bummer.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.328
Clock didn't go off.

09:36.743 --> 09:38.328
I thought I set it right.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.414
Oh, I reset it.

09:38.370 --> 09:40.414
I had to catch up on some sleep.

09:40.455 --> 09:41.581
I didn't know

09:40.455 --> 09:41.581
you set it for early.

09:41.622 --> 09:42.790
Honest mistake.

09:42.832 --> 09:44.334
Maybe we should

This is a wedding dress.

I would like Lane

12:26.246 --> 12:28.623
to wear it at her wedding.

12:28.665 --> 12:30.625

12:28.665 --> 12:30.625
Lane is smaller than me.

12:30.667 --> 12:32.586
It might need a hem, and the

in the newsroom?

14:49.514 --> 14:51.224
- It's not hurting anybody.

14:49.514 --> 14:51.224
- It's disgusting.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.393
- I just need five more minutes.

14:51.265 --> 14:53.393
- Don't rush, Paris.

14:53.434 --> 14:55.186
The fruit flies

14:53.434 --> 14:55.186
are not hurting anybody

14:55.228 --> 14:57.522
and Paris is working on

14:55.228 --> 14:57.522
something that I'm waiting on.

14:57.564 --> 15:00.024
I would prefer it

14:57.564 --> 15:00.024
if she weren't interrupted.

15:00.066 --> 15:01.234
Sorry, Paris.

15:04.111 --> 15:06.030
[phone ringing]

15:09.367 --> 15:11.411
Alright, guys, just remind me,

15:09.367 --> 15:11.411
who's allergic to dairy?

15:11.452 --> 15:12.995
There you go. No mayo.

15:13.037 --> 15:14.955
Who's allergic to wheat?

15:14.997 --> 15:16.708
There you go, Tori,

15:14.997 --> 15:16.708
bound for glory.

15:16.750 --> 15:18.334
- And who's low sodium?

15:16.750 --> 15:18.334
- Right here.

15:18.376 --> 15:22.129
There you go, apple-brown

15:18.376 --> 15:22.129
Betty Freddie, no salt.

15:22.171 --> 15:23.964
[sighs]

15:24.006 --> 15:25.091
- Uh, hey.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.091
- Hey.

15:25.132 --> 15:26.384
You know, I'm still mad

15:26.426 --> 15:28.928
about that math competition.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.971
Those buzzers in the countdown

15:28.969 --> 15:30.971
round were rigged.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.891
I know they were.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.891
The judges were on the take.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.559
He's called

15:32.932 --> 15:34.559
a moderator, actually.

15:34.601 --> 15:38.688
Yeah, well, whatever they are.

15:34.601 --> 15:38.688
I'm lodging a protest.

15:38.730 --> 15:40.565
Luke, could we talk for a sec?

15:40.607 --> 15:41.566
Sure.

15:44.861 --> 15:47.321
What's up?

15:47.363 --> 15:50.032
- You know Freddie, right?

15:47.363 --> 15:50.032
- Yeah, good kid.

15:50.074 --> 15:51.576
Well, I-I like him.

15:51.618 --> 15:53.703
Oh, well,

15:51.618 --> 15:53.703
I like him too.

15:53.745 --> 15:55.496
He seems less insane

15:53.745 --> 15:55.496
than the others.

15:55.538 --> 15:57.998
I don't mean like him

15:55.538 --> 15:57.998
the way you like him, I hope.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.250
You've known him longer.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.710
- And I'm a girl.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.710
- I know that.

16:00.752 --> 16:04.297
- And he's a boy.

16:00.752 --> 16:04.297
- I know that, too.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.716
- Oh! You<i> like</i> him. Sorry.

16:04.338 --> 16:06.716
- Shh!

16:06.758 --> 16:08.760
I'm not quite ready to proclaim

16:06.758 --> 16:08.760
it to the world just yet.

16:08.802 --> 16:10.804
Are you old enough

16:08.802 --> 16:10.804
to like a boy?

16:10.845 --> 16:11.930
I'm not sure.

16:11.971 --> 16:13.598
I'll have to

16:11.971 --> 16:13.598
look it up in a book

16:13.640 --> 16:15.266
see whether or not you're

16:13.640 --> 16:15.266
supposed to like boys yet.

16:15.308 --> 16:16.476
Well, it's a fact

16:15.308 --> 16:16.476
either which way.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.185
Okay, so what do you

16:16.517 --> 16:18.185
want me to do?

16:18.227 --> 16:21.272
For starters, it would help if

16:18.227 --> 16:21.272
you stopped calling him Betty.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.441
And you sitting

16:21.314 --> 16:23.441
next to me all the time

16:23.483 --> 16:24.609
is kind of

16:23.483 --> 16:24.609
getting in the way.

16:24.651 --> 16:26.235
Oh, jeez,

16:24.651 --> 16:26.235
I didn't realize.

16:26.277 --> 16:27.570
I know.

16:26.277 --> 16:27.570
You're pretty oblivious.

16:27.612 --> 16:28.988
But, it seems

16:27.612 --> 16:28.988
like Freddie is--

16:29.029 --> 16:30.448
- Don't look at him!

16:29.029 --> 16:30.448
- Sorry.

16:30.490 --> 16:31.825
It just seems

16:30.490 --> 16:31.825
like you pay less attention

16:31.866 --> 16:33.075
to Freddie

16:31.866 --> 16:33.075
than any of the other boys.

16:33.117 --> 16:34.410
It's because I like him.

16:34.452 --> 16:35.954
You like him,

16:34.452 --> 16:35.954
so you ignore him?

16:35.995 --> 16:37.330
But you're always

16:35.995 --> 16:37.330
palling around with Kevin.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.873
- Kevin makes me sick.

16:37.371 --> 16:38.873
- I'm confused.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.625
- You're over thinking this.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.625
- I must be.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.460
- Don't look at him!

16:40.667 --> 16:42.460
- I'm sorry.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.755
[sighs]

16:45.797 --> 16:48.424
Well, I shouldn't be sitting

16:45.797 --> 16:48.424
next to you, then, huh?

16:48.466 --> 16:50.384
Maybe not.

16:50.426 --> 16:52.052
Guess I'll go sit

16:50.426 --> 16:52.052
with the parents.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.263
- I think that's a good idea.

16:52.094 --> 16:54.263
- Okay.

16:54.305 --> 16:56.641
Well, you wanna

16:54.305 --> 16:56.641
go back together

16:56.683 --> 16:58.601
or should we

16:56.683 --> 16:58.601
stagger it a little?

16:58.643 --> 17:00.311
Give me a four-second

16:58.643 --> 17:00.311
head start.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.521
You got it.

17:03.940 --> 17:05.065
[sighs]

17:05.107 --> 17:06.693
(Robert)

17:05.107 --> 17:06.693
'The bottle is dry.'

17:06.734 --> 17:08.486
(Colin)

17:06.734 --> 17:08.486
'You cannot be

17:06.734 --> 17:08.486
out of Wild Turkey.'

17:08.528 --> 17:09.612
(Logan)

17:08.528 --> 17:09.612
'I've got everything else

17:08.528 --> 17:09.612
under the sun.'

17:09.654 --> 17:10.864
'Pick one

17:09.654 --> 17:10.864
and stop your nagging.'

17:10.905 --> 17:12.991
You cannot

17:10.905 --> 17:12.991
be out of Wild Turkey.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.408
(Logan)

17:13.032 --> 17:14.408
'No matter how many times

17:13.032 --> 17:14.408
you tell me I'm not out'

17:14.450 --> 17:15.785
'doesn't change

17:14.450 --> 17:15.785
the fact that I'm out.'

17:15.827 --> 17:17.077
(Colin)

17:15.827 --> 17:17.077
'Hands.'

17:17.119 --> 17:18.120
Jerk.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.706
- Hi, everyone.

17:18.162 --> 17:19.706
- Hey, Rory.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.541
Get yourself a drink.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.541
Anything but Wild Turkey.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.959
- I'm okay.

17:21.582 --> 17:22.959
- Yeah, forget it.

17:23.001 --> 17:24.084
She doesn't drink

17:23.001 --> 17:24.084
on school nights.

17:24.126 --> 17:25.586
I sometimes do.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.087
I'm getting a sense

17:25.628 --> 17:27.087
that the woman of the house

17:27.129 --> 17:28.798
had no idea we were

17:27.129 --> 17:28.798
going to be here.

17:28.840 --> 17:30.299
- Okay that we're here, love?

17:28.840 --> 17:30.299
- Of course, it's okay.

17:30.341 --> 17:31.592
Logan, I haven't

17:30.341 --> 17:31.592
called you love

17:31.634 --> 17:33.177
since that

17:31.634 --> 17:33.177
sultry night in Bimini.

17:33.219 --> 17:35.095
It's fine that you're here,

17:33.219 --> 17:35.095
guys, you're always welcome.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.724
- What's with the maps?

17:35.137 --> 17:37.724
- Graduation is imminent, Rory.

17:37.765 --> 17:41.019
So, we are planning the ultimate

17:37.765 --> 17:41.019
Life and Death Brigade event.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.896
Not only the ultimate,

17:41.060 --> 17:42.896
but the penultimate.

17:42.937 --> 17:44.731
Penultimate means

17:42.937 --> 17:44.731
next to last, Finn.

17:44.772 --> 17:46.024
This is the last one.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.775
I thought it meant

17:46.065 --> 17:47.775
super-ultimate.

17:47.817 --> 17:49.569
- How did you get into Yale?

17:47.817 --> 17:49.569
- Slept with the recruiter.

17:49.610 --> 17:50.904
So, what's the stunt?

17:50.945 --> 17:52.363
We're flown

17:50.945 --> 17:52.363
on a twin-engine plane

17:52.405 --> 17:54.323
to a remote spot

17:52.405 --> 17:54.323
in Costa Rica.

17:54.365 --> 17:57.493
We don parachutes, base-jump

17:54.365 --> 17:57.493
off a cliff whose height is..

17:57.535 --> 18:01.330
Exactly 3,624 feet,

17:57.535 --> 18:01.330
unless that's a two.

18:01.372 --> 18:03.041
We land on the banks

18:01.372 --> 18:03.041
of the San Juan river.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.458
Hopefully not

18:03.082 --> 18:04.458
<i>in</i> the river.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.585
Or on the Nicaraguan side

18:04.500 --> 18:05.585
of the river.

18:05.626 --> 18:06.627
Or in Panama.

18:06.669 --> 18:08.128
We inflate a raft,

18:06.669 --> 18:08.128
white-water

18:08.170 --> 18:09.589
three miles down

18:08.170 --> 18:09.589
to a meeting point

18:09.630 --> 18:11.298
where a blowout party

18:09.630 --> 18:11.298
will take place.

18:11.340 --> 18:14.010
It's a two, gents, I'm pretty

18:11.340 --> 18:14.010
sure it's a two...or an eight.

18:14.052 --> 18:15.428
Where do you get

18:14.052 --> 18:15.428
the inflatable raft?

18:15.469 --> 18:17.430
One of us will parachute

18:15.469 --> 18:17.430
with it in our packs.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.765
Not me.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.765
I've got the DVD player.

18:18.806 --> 18:20.391
Not me, I've got

18:18.806 --> 18:20.391
the champagne and the bong.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.893
If I take it,

18:20.433 --> 18:21.893
it'll crush the cigars.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.311
Stand down, boys.

18:21.935 --> 18:24.311
I'll jump with the raft.

18:24.353 --> 18:26.064
You're planning this

18:24.353 --> 18:26.064
all very carefully, right?

18:26.105 --> 18:29.025
Luckily, we have a topographical

18:26.105 --> 18:29.025
map expert in our midst.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.944
It's a three.

18:29.067 --> 18:30.944
I'm 90 percent sure.

18:30.985 --> 18:33.571
Why don't you make extra sure

18:30.985 --> 18:33.571
you have the right number there?

18:33.613 --> 18:35.239
Hey, let the man

18:33.613 --> 18:35.239
do his thing.

18:35.281 --> 18:37.533
Well, I would, if the man

18:35.281 --> 18:37.533
doing his thing weren't drunk

18:37.575 --> 18:39.953
and hadn't forgotten

18:37.575 --> 18:39.953
to put on his reading glasses.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.412
Oh, my God.

18:39.994 --> 18:41.412
I'm not wearing my glasses.

18:41.454 --> 18:42.789
They flew off

18:41.454 --> 18:42.789
when you did that impression

18:42.830 --> 18:44.498
of the old guy

18:42.830 --> 18:44.498
getting shot by Dick Cheney.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.709
Who's flying

18:44.540 --> 18:46.709
this twin-engine airplane

18:46.751 --> 18:48.795
and who's supplying

18:46.751 --> 18:48.795
the parachutes?

18:48.836 --> 18:52.048
I mean, there must be a weight

18:48.836 --> 18:52.048
limit to make that jump, right?

18:52.090 --> 18:53.299
Do you guys know

18:52.090 --> 18:53.299
what the weight limit is?

18:53.340 --> 18:54.759
So you came home

18:53.340 --> 18:54.759
just to piss on the fun?

18:54.801 --> 18:57.095
No, I came home

18:54.801 --> 18:57.095
because I live here.

18:58.679 --> 18:59.931
You know, guys,

18:58.679 --> 18:59.931
maybe we should resume

18:59.973 --> 19:01.390
our planning another time.

19:01.432 --> 19:02.683
Yeah, I guess,

19:01.432 --> 19:02.683
maybe we should.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.018
I'll never be able

19:02.725 --> 19:04.018
to refold these.

19:04.060 --> 19:06.395
Just grab them

19:04.060 --> 19:06.395
and let's go, Robert.

19:06.437 --> 19:07.939
Okay if I return this

19:06.437 --> 19:07.939
another time?

19:07.981 --> 19:08.940
Sure.

19:10.650 --> 19:11.734
Go with them

19:10.650 --> 19:11.734
if you want.

19:11.776 --> 19:13.069
Is it your life mission

19:13.111 --> 19:15.780
to embarrass me at every

19:13.111 --> 19:15.780
opportunity you get?

19:15.822 --> 19:17.698
It's Robert, Colin

19:15.822 --> 19:17.698
and Finn, Logan.

19:17.740 --> 19:19.951
I've seen them all dance naked

19:17.740 --> 19:19.951
with underwear on their heads.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.368
There's no embarrassing you

19:19.993 --> 19:21.368
in front of them.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.704
- You embarrassed me tonight.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.704
- How?

19:23.746 --> 19:25.123
By pointing out that

19:23.746 --> 19:25.123
the stunt you're planning

19:25.164 --> 19:26.624
doesn't exactly

19:25.164 --> 19:26.624
sound safe?

19:26.666 --> 19:28.709
It's called the Life

19:26.666 --> 19:28.709
and Death Brigade, Rory.

19:28.751 --> 19:31.087
Yeah, and you're supposed

19:28.751 --> 19:31.087
to try to avoid the death part.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.380
This is not your business,

19:31.129 --> 19:33.380
and why aren't you at the paper?

19:33.422 --> 19:34.632
You're always at the paper

19:33.422 --> 19:34.632
at this time of night.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.258
- Finished early.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.258
- How?

19:36.300 --> 19:38.803
You delegate a little, let

19:36.300 --> 19:38.803
people write their own articles?

19:38.845 --> 19:40.763
- That's old news.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.763
- It's not old news.

19:40.805 --> 19:43.057
You knew that would embarrass

19:40.805 --> 19:43.057
me, and you didn't care.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.600
Even when we're together,

19:43.099 --> 19:44.600
you're someplace else.

19:44.642 --> 19:46.393
You leave, and you don't

19:44.642 --> 19:46.393
kiss me goodbye.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.187
We're at dinner, you're on your

19:46.435 --> 19:48.187
cell phone the whole time.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.981
You never leave notes anymore

19:48.228 --> 19:49.981
about where you're gonna be

19:50.023 --> 19:52.025
so I have no idea where you are,

19:50.023 --> 19:52.025
you haven't forgiven me.

19:52.066 --> 19:53.442
What are you talkin' about?

19:53.484 --> 19:54.819
For the girls I was with

19:53.484 --> 19:54.819
when we were separated.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.236
I said I forgive you.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.989
Yeah, you said it,

19:56.278 --> 19:57.989
but you haven't, though.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.240
You haven't.

20:00.282 --> 20:02.076
I'll be at the pub.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.544
Lorelai!

20:11.585 --> 20:13.171
- Hi, Lane.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.171
- You're in possession.

20:13.212 --> 20:14.630
- Of what?

20:13.212 --> 20:14.630
- Of the wedding dress.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.716
Oh, um, yeah.

20:14.672 --> 20:16.716
It's safe and sound.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.217
I was just starting

20:16.757 --> 20:18.217
to dig into it.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.845
Don't dig.

20:18.258 --> 20:20.845
Slice, kill, maim, destroy.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.388
Sic a mad pack of wolves on it.

20:22.429 --> 20:24.098
Douse it with lighter fluid

20:22.429 --> 20:24.098
and turn into ash.

20:24.140 --> 20:25.349
I cannot wear that dress.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.767
Yeah, I know.

20:25.391 --> 20:26.767
It's a little old-world.

20:26.809 --> 20:28.268
- Have you looked at it?

20:26.809 --> 20:28.268
- Parts of it.

20:28.310 --> 20:30.104
Exactly, you can't

20:28.310 --> 20:30.104
take it in all at once.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.647
The human eyeball

20:30.146 --> 20:31.647
is not capable.

20:31.689 --> 20:32.815
Oh, it's not that bad.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.734
- It's got pants.

20:32.857 --> 20:34.734
- No!

20:34.775 --> 20:36.443
You didn't look at it

20:34.775 --> 20:36.443
very carefully.

20:36.485 --> 20:37.904
Well, I will

20:36.485 --> 20:37.904
remove the pants.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.488
Oh, it's every girl's dream

20:39.530 --> 20:41.032
to hear the woman altering

20:39.530 --> 20:41.032
her wedding dress say

20:41.074 --> 20:42.366
"I'll remove the pants."

20:42.408 --> 20:43.993
I'm sure once I

20:42.408 --> 20:43.993
alter it a little--

20:44.035 --> 20:45.703
No, don't alter it.

20:44.035 --> 20:45.703
Have an accident.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.039
Leave a warm iron on it.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.039
Spill a vat of acid on it.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.498
- Run your car over it.

20:48.081 --> 20:49.498
- Lane, Lane.

20:49.540 --> 20:50.708
I haven't even

20:49.540 --> 20:50.708
put it on the mannequin yet.

20:50.750 --> 20:51.918
Now, let me start work on it

20:51.959 --> 20:53.627
and I will keep you fully posted

20:53.669 --> 20:55.504
every step of the way and..

20:55.546 --> 20:58.091
- 'Oh, my God.'

20:55.546 --> 20:58.091
- What? My mom?

20:58.132 --> 21:01.010
No, my mom and dad.

20:58.132 --> 21:01.010
I thought I saw something.

21:01.052 --> 21:02.720
Well, focus, focus.

21:02.762 --> 21:04.180
Important topic

21:02.762 --> 21:04.180
we're discussing here.

21:04.222 --> 21:05.598
Alright, I gotta run.

21:04.222 --> 21:05.598
I'll call you later.

21:05.639 --> 21:06.599
Lorelai!

21:12.396 --> 21:13.898
- I'm not above bribing.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.898
- Oh, my God, Lane.

21:13.940 --> 21:15.024
Don't sneak up on me

21:13.940 --> 21:15.024
like that.

21:15.066 --> 21:16.483
It's all about

21:15.066 --> 21:16.483
the Hamiltons, baby.

21:16.525 --> 21:18.402
You can't pay me

21:16.525 --> 21:18.402
to ruin your dress.

21:18.444 --> 21:19.570
Look, forget

21:18.444 --> 21:19.570
about your parents

21:19.612 --> 21:21.114
for a minute

21:19.612 --> 21:21.114
and concentrate on this.

21:21.155 --> 21:22.949
Wait, so you saw them, too?

21:21.155 --> 21:22.949
I'm not insane?

21:22.990 --> 21:24.075
They've been walking

21:22.990 --> 21:24.075
around town all morning.

21:24.117 --> 21:26.244
All morning?

21:24.117 --> 21:26.244
Any guess as to why?

21:26.285 --> 21:27.494
Shred the dress,

21:26.285 --> 21:27.494
and I'll tell you.

21:27.536 --> 21:28.913
- Do you really know why?

21:27.536 --> 21:28.913
- No.

21:28.955 --> 21:31.165
Well, then I'm not

21:28.955 --> 21:31.165
gonna ruin the dress.

21:31.207 --> 21:32.750
Well, I did see them

21:31.207 --> 21:32.750
talking to Kirk earlier.

21:32.792 --> 21:33.918
- Kirk?

21:32.792 --> 21:33.918
- Yeah.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.502
And he was wearing

21:33.960 --> 21:35.502
his maroon jacket.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.379
That's the real-estate jacket.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.379
This is not good.

21:37.421 --> 21:40.216
- This is not good!

21:37.421 --> 21:40.216
- My life is in your hands.

21:40.258 --> 21:42.301
I don't think you're fully

21:40.258 --> 21:42.301
comprehending that fact.

21:49.683 --> 21:51.560
I guess, I'm going.

21:51.602 --> 21:53.187
Okay.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.689
I'll be out of cell phone range

21:53.229 --> 21:55.689
for a couple days.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.942
I know.

21:57.984 --> 21:59.235
[sighs]

21:59.277 --> 22:00.945
I'll see you.

22:06.700 --> 22:07.660
Kirk!

22:11.330 --> 22:13.332
- Kirk.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.332
- Mask!

22:13.373 --> 22:15.293
- What?

22:13.373 --> 22:15.293
- Mask.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.503
- What is this?

22:15.334 --> 22:17.503
- I've done it, Lorelai.

22:17.544 --> 22:19.839
I finally landed

22:17.544 --> 22:19.839
my first listing.

22:19.880 --> 22:21.299
What...where are my parents?

22:21.340 --> 22:22.925
This is

22:21.340 --> 22:22.925
the beginning of my rise

22:22.967 --> 22:24.593
to the top of the

22:22.967 --> 22:24.593
real-estate industry.

22:24.635 --> 22:25.970
Where are my parents?

22:26.012 --> 22:27.263
Do you happen to be in

22:26.012 --> 22:27.263
the market for a house?

22:27.305 --> 22:28.597
'Cause this baby's a honey.

22:28.639 --> 22:30.016
Something in the corner

22:28.639 --> 22:30.016
just moved.

22:30.057 --> 22:31.642
Just a rat,

22:30.057 --> 22:31.642
I'd have told you about them

22:31.684 --> 22:33.060
before you bought the place.

22:33.102 --> 22:34.854
'The law also requires me

22:33.102 --> 22:34.854
to inform you'

22:34.895 --> 22:39.066
that the house has toxic mold,

22:34.895 --> 22:39.066
asbestos, methane gas

22:39.108 --> 22:43.070
buckling floors, a crumbling

22:39.108 --> 22:43.070
foundation, visible fungus

22:43.112 --> 22:46.699
a collapsed fireplace,

22:43.112 --> 22:46.699
ceiling damage, water damage

22:46.740 --> 22:49.160
and it was the recent site

22:46.740 --> 22:49.160
of a Wicca convention

22:49.202 --> 22:51.620
and a particularly grisly

22:49.202 --> 22:51.620
murder/suicide.

22:51.662 --> 22:53.039
Nothing we can't

22:51.662 --> 22:53.039
work with.

22:53.080 --> 22:54.748
I'm not in the market,

22:53.080 --> 22:54.748
Kirk. Now, listen.

22:54.790 --> 22:56.583
I know my parents

22:54.790 --> 22:56.583
are shopping for houses.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.002
Lane saw you with them

22:56.625 --> 22:58.002
and I need to know

22:58.044 --> 22:59.377
where they are right now.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.130
I'm sorry.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.130
That's confidential information.

23:01.172 --> 23:03.299
In fact, the fact that I was

23:01.172 --> 23:03.299
with them was confidential.

23:03.341 --> 23:04.591
so I'm gonna have

23:03.341 --> 23:04.591
to ask you to pretend

23:04.633 --> 23:05.968
that I haven't already confirmed

23:06.010 --> 23:08.012
that I was with them,

23:06.010 --> 23:08.012
which I wasn't.

23:08.054 --> 23:10.597
- Oh, God, what was that?

23:08.054 --> 23:10.597
- Bat. Don't worry.

23:10.639 --> 23:13.893
When you spray for cockroaches,

23:10.639 --> 23:13.893
the bats die, too, usually.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.561
At the very least,

23:13.934 --> 23:15.561
it knocks the wind out of them

23:15.602 --> 23:16.979
so they wind up

23:15.602 --> 23:16.979
wobbling on the floor

23:17.021 --> 23:18.731
so you can just whack 'em

23:17.021 --> 23:18.731
with a hammer.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.649
- Nothing we can't work with.

23:18.772 --> 23:20.649
- Kirk, I am your friend.

23:20.691 --> 23:23.443
But they are my parents, and I

23:20.691 --> 23:23.443
need to find them right now.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.905
- It's important.

23:23.485 --> 23:25.905
- I shouldn't tell you this.

23:25.946 --> 23:29.283
But I know they were looking at

23:25.946 --> 23:29.283
two properties on Maple Drive.

23:29.325 --> 23:30.951
They're probably

23:29.325 --> 23:30.951
around there right now.

23:30.993 --> 23:33.495
Too bad I couldn't get them

23:30.993 --> 23:33.495
interested in this property.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.748
It has great bones.

23:33.537 --> 23:35.748
Literally.

23:35.789 --> 23:37.708
There's an Indian

23:35.789 --> 23:37.708
burial ground underneath it.

23:37.750 --> 23:39.417
Thanks. See ya.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.922
Don't run.

23:40.794 --> 23:42.922
It scares the bat.

23:45.507 --> 23:47.927
[instrumental music]

24:14.661 --> 24:16.496
[gasps]

24:14.661 --> 24:16.496
Mom, dad!

24:16.538 --> 24:18.540
- Wow! What are you doing here?

24:16.538 --> 24:18.540
- Lorelai.

24:18.582 --> 24:20.084
Hey, did we have

24:18.582 --> 24:20.084
something set up?

24:20.126 --> 24:21.294
- Uh, no.

24:20.126 --> 24:21.294
- No.

24:21.335 --> 24:23.212
- No.

24:21.335 --> 24:23.212
- No? Then what's up?

24:23.254 --> 24:26.257
- Well, we're here to, um..

24:23.254 --> 24:26.257
- Do a little antiquing.

24:26.299 --> 24:28.008
- Antiquing?

24:26.299 --> 24:28.008
- Right, antiquing.

24:28.050 --> 24:30.636
We're hitting Litchfield,

24:28.050 --> 24:30.636
Woodbridge, Washington Depot.

24:30.677 --> 24:32.470
Well, we have

24:30.677 --> 24:32.470
some great antique stores

24:32.512 --> 24:34.056
right here

24:32.512 --> 24:34.056
in little old Stars Hollow.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.183
- That's what brings us.

24:34.098 --> 24:36.183
- You've been to Madison House?

24:36.225 --> 24:37.684
- Where?

24:36.225 --> 24:37.684
- 'Madison House.

24:37.726 --> 24:39.645
Oh, amazing stuff,

24:37.726 --> 24:39.645
lots of colonial.

24:39.686 --> 24:42.940
It's not in my price range,

24:39.686 --> 24:42.940
but I love to browse around.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.358
- I'll take you there right now.

24:42.982 --> 24:44.358
- Oh.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.610
Uh, I don't know

24:44.400 --> 24:46.610
if now is a good time.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.570
- We got an appointment to keep.

24:46.652 --> 24:48.570
- An appointment?

24:48.612 --> 24:50.530
Huh, I thought you were

24:48.612 --> 24:50.530
just walking around shopping.

24:50.572 --> 24:52.408
We are,

24:50.572 --> 24:52.408
we made an appointment

24:52.450 --> 24:55.077
at an appointments-only

24:52.450 --> 24:55.077
antique shop.

24:55.119 --> 24:57.121
- We have those here?

24:55.119 --> 24:57.121
- Well, obviously, you do.

24:57.163 --> 24:58.914
Because we have

24:57.163 --> 24:58.914
an appointment at one.

24:58.956 --> 24:59.999
Well, I'll go with you.

25:00.040 --> 25:01.750
They're only

25:00.040 --> 25:01.750
expecting two of us.

25:01.792 --> 25:04.670
They can squeeze in one more. I

25:01.792 --> 25:04.670
Promise I won't break anything.

25:04.711 --> 25:06.922
- Come on, take me there.

25:04.711 --> 25:06.922
- It's actually not for a while.

25:06.964 --> 25:08.341
So, we can't

25:06.964 --> 25:08.341
take you there right now.

25:08.382 --> 25:10.134
Perfect, then we'll hit

25:08.382 --> 25:10.134
Madison House first.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.509
It's just a ten minute walk.

25:10.176 --> 25:11.509
Come on.

25:11.551 --> 25:14.013
- Alright. Lead the way.

25:11.551 --> 25:14.013
- Cool.

25:14.054 --> 25:15.555
You know, I'd say let's drive

25:15.597 --> 25:17.308
but our streets,

25:15.597 --> 25:17.308
forget about it.

25:17.350 --> 25:19.935
- What about the streets?

25:17.350 --> 25:19.935
- They're clogged night and day.

25:19.977 --> 25:22.062
Yup, total gridlock,

25:19.977 --> 25:22.062
it's not gonna help

25:22.104 --> 25:24.106
when they build

25:22.104 --> 25:24.106
that big box store.

25:24.148 --> 25:25.358
- They're building a box store?

25:24.148 --> 25:25.358
- Oh, yeah.

25:25.399 --> 25:26.692
Right in the center of town.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.068
- Those things are hideous.

25:26.733 --> 25:28.068
- Yeah.

25:28.110 --> 25:30.029
It's gonna wipe out

25:28.110 --> 25:30.029
all our local businesses.

25:30.070 --> 25:33.491
This place will be a ghost town.

25:30.070 --> 25:33.491
Ooh, hold your breath.

25:33.531 --> 25:35.617
Oh, God, sorry.

25:33.531 --> 25:35.617
Sewer problems.

25:35.659 --> 25:37.535
Your public-works department

25:35.659 --> 25:37.535
needs to be notified.

25:37.577 --> 25:39.497
No, they're on strike.

25:37.577 --> 25:39.497
Well, they're always on strike.

25:39.537 --> 25:41.332
[coughs]

25:39.537 --> 25:41.332
Excuse me.

25:41.374 --> 25:42.458
Allergies?

25:42.500 --> 25:44.210
Meth lab.

25:44.251 --> 25:46.670
[instrumental music]

26:01.185 --> 26:03.521
- We need our own bar.

26:01.185 --> 26:03.521
- You say it like I'm fighting.

26:03.561 --> 26:05.147
- I'm not fighting you.

26:03.561 --> 26:05.147
- Same here.

26:05.189 --> 26:07.483
We need a public place

26:05.189 --> 26:07.483
where the next de Kooning

26:07.525 --> 26:09.109
can run into the

26:07.525 --> 26:09.109
next Franz Kline

26:09.151 --> 26:10.652
and dis the next

26:09.151 --> 26:10.652
Jackson Pollock

26:10.694 --> 26:13.489
while the next Charlie Parker

26:10.694 --> 26:13.489
shoots up in the corner.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.282
- So a nice family place.

26:13.531 --> 26:15.282
- I'm not kidding.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.868
We'll call it,

26:15.324 --> 26:17.868
"Cedar Bar Redux."

26:17.910 --> 26:19.953
I would kick my own ass

26:17.910 --> 26:19.953
if we called it that.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.289
Why don't we call it "Devoid

26:19.995 --> 26:22.289
Of Original Ideas Poseur Bar?"

26:22.331 --> 26:23.332
[laughs]

26:23.374 --> 26:25.000
Go to hell, both of you.

26:25.042 --> 26:27.169
Hey, come back

26:25.042 --> 26:27.169
for a hug, man.

26:27.211 --> 26:29.422
Hey, there's Alicia Matheson

26:27.211 --> 26:29.422
from "The Weekly."

26:29.463 --> 26:31.798
Whoa. Grab Matthew.

26:29.463 --> 26:31.798
Get him off the bar thing.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.759
Have him show her around.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.759
That's what he does best.

26:33.800 --> 26:35.302
"Cedar Bar Redux."

26:40.933 --> 26:42.351
So my eyes

26:40.933 --> 26:42.351
don't deceive me.

26:42.393 --> 26:44.186
First thing's first.

26:42.393 --> 26:44.186
What the hell is that?

26:44.228 --> 26:45.479
It's an abstract painting.

26:45.521 --> 26:47.231
But what is it

26:45.521 --> 26:47.231
supposed to be?

26:47.273 --> 26:49.024
- Check the title.

26:47.273 --> 26:49.024
- I did. It's called "Untitled."

26:49.066 --> 26:50.692
- There you go.

26:49.066 --> 26:50.692
- I give up.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.986
- So, you got the invite.

26:50.734 --> 26:52.986
- I got the invite.

26:53.028 --> 26:54.321
I guess,

26:53.028 --> 26:54.321
I didn't think you'd come.

26:54.363 --> 26:55.364
You guessed wrong, nephew.

26:55.406 --> 26:56.532
Cool. So you want the tour?

26:56.574 --> 26:57.908
- Give me a tour.

26:56.574 --> 26:57.908
- Alright.

26:57.950 --> 27:00.244
Well, this is where

26:57.950 --> 27:00.244
we work, Truncheon Books.

27:00.286 --> 27:02.746
There's usually desks

27:00.286 --> 27:02.746
and crap piled up everywhere

27:02.788 --> 27:04.373
but we cleaned up

27:02.788 --> 27:04.373
for today.

27:04.415 --> 27:06.208
Those are the books

27:04.415 --> 27:06.208
that we put out.

27:06.250 --> 27:09.420
We publish our zine once

27:06.250 --> 27:09.420
a month, except last August

27:09.462 --> 27:11.505
when my partner forgot

27:09.462 --> 27:11.505
to pay the printer.

27:11.547 --> 27:13.715
We let local artists

27:11.547 --> 27:13.715
hang their stuff up

27:13.757 --> 27:16.176
without ripping them off

27:13.757 --> 27:16.176
on commissions.

27:16.218 --> 27:19.679
We do performances over there,

27:16.218 --> 27:19.679
and a few of us live upstairs.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.266
That you don't want to see.

27:19.721 --> 27:22.266
It's a disaster zone.

27:22.308 --> 27:23.850
- This is yours, right?

27:22.308 --> 27:23.850
- Yeah.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.269
I wanted to get it,

27:23.892 --> 27:25.269
but I couldn't find it.

27:25.311 --> 27:26.770
Yeah, it's not exactly

27:25.311 --> 27:26.770
"The Da Vinci Code."

27:26.812 --> 27:29.982
Well, I will definitely

27:26.812 --> 27:29.982
get it today.

27:30.023 --> 27:32.234
By the way,

27:30.023 --> 27:32.234
that is your cousin.

27:32.276 --> 27:35.112
(Jess)

27:32.276 --> 27:35.112
'Right, Liz filled me in

27:32.276 --> 27:35.112
on all that, daddy.'

27:35.154 --> 27:38.073
She just calls me Luke.

27:35.154 --> 27:38.073
Total brain.

27:38.115 --> 27:40.367
- You confirm paternity?

27:38.115 --> 27:40.367
- Don't be a wiseass.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.286
Hey, April,

27:40.409 --> 27:42.286
I want you to meet somebody.

27:44.079 --> 27:46.915
Meet your cousin Jess.

27:44.079 --> 27:46.915
He's my sister's kid.

27:46.957 --> 27:49.042
- Hi.

27:46.957 --> 27:49.042
- Hey.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.461
Men in this family

27:49.084 --> 27:50.461
aren't chatty.

27:50.503 --> 27:51.878
Sorry.

27:51.920 --> 27:53.339
I'm gonna go, explore

27:51.920 --> 27:53.339
a little more.

27:53.380 --> 27:55.508
Cool.

27:55.549 --> 27:57.009
How are you

27:55.549 --> 27:57.009
adjusting to all that?

27:57.050 --> 27:58.344
Okay, I guess,

27:57.050 --> 27:58.344
I like her

27:58.385 --> 28:00.012
and she just sort

27:58.385 --> 28:00.012
of tolerates me.

28:00.053 --> 28:02.097
- Seems like it.

28:00.053 --> 28:02.097
- Thanks for the perspective.

28:02.139 --> 28:03.681
That's why I'm here.

28:02.139 --> 28:03.681
Hey, come on.

28:03.723 --> 28:05.934
I got some sculpture over here

28:03.723 --> 28:05.934
you're really gonna hate.

28:07.727 --> 28:09.438
Ooh, that garbage smell.

28:09.480 --> 28:11.440
- What garbage smell?

28:09.480 --> 28:11.440
- I don't smell garbage.

28:11.482 --> 28:13.526
Yeah, the wind shifted

28:11.482 --> 28:13.526
right after I said it.

28:13.567 --> 28:16.069
Allowing a landfill within

28:13.567 --> 28:16.069
a mile of city limits, crazy.

28:16.111 --> 28:17.488
- It's within a mile?

28:16.111 --> 28:17.488
- Yeah.

28:17.530 --> 28:19.239
Destroying

28:17.530 --> 28:19.239
everyone's land values.

28:19.281 --> 28:21.450
- Oh, well, where'd you park?

28:19.281 --> 28:21.450
- Over on Peach Street.

28:21.492 --> 28:23.661
- Oh, you mean Carjack Lane?

28:21.492 --> 28:23.661
- "Carjack Lane?"

28:23.701 --> 28:24.911
Yeah. Better

28:23.701 --> 28:24.911
than Chop Shop Alley.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.664
- Here, follow me.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.664
- Oh, God.

28:26.704 --> 28:29.625
Watch out for the pothole.

28:26.704 --> 28:29.625
Ooh, I tell you.

28:29.667 --> 28:31.418
The roads are just the things

28:31.460 --> 28:33.671
in between potholes

28:31.460 --> 28:33.671
in this town, huh?

28:33.711 --> 28:36.048
You should talk to your mayor

28:33.711 --> 28:36.048
about all these issues, Lorelai.

28:36.089 --> 28:37.508
You mean gropey McGee?

28:36.089 --> 28:37.508
I cannot.

28:37.550 --> 28:39.968
Will not ever put

28:37.550 --> 28:39.968
myself in that position again.

28:40.010 --> 28:41.720
Mind if we

28:40.010 --> 28:41.720
stop by the store?

28:43.222 --> 28:44.806
Well, I'm running low

28:43.222 --> 28:44.806
on a lot of basics

28:44.848 --> 28:46.225
and I just want to see

28:44.848 --> 28:46.225
if they got them in.

28:46.266 --> 28:47.934
This is a cute

28:46.266 --> 28:47.934
little store.

28:47.976 --> 28:50.646
If you can be cute

28:47.976 --> 28:50.646
and unclean at the same time.

28:50.688 --> 28:52.606
Alright, let's see. No.

28:52.648 --> 28:54.983
No. No.

28:55.025 --> 28:56.652
Nope, and this is

28:55.025 --> 28:56.652
the only store in town.

28:56.694 --> 28:58.237
- What are you looking for?

28:56.694 --> 28:58.237
- What am I looking for?

28:58.278 --> 28:59.655
Everything.

28:58.278 --> 28:59.655
They have nothing.

28:59.697 --> 29:01.281
The little they have

28:59.697 --> 29:01.281
is off-brands

29:01.323 --> 29:03.200
which wouldn't

29:01.323 --> 29:03.200
be so galling except

29:03.242 --> 29:05.494
everything's so far past

29:03.242 --> 29:05.494
its expiration date.

29:05.536 --> 29:07.829
Hey, help yourself

29:05.536 --> 29:07.829
to some Little George's chips.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.332
Yum, Yum.

29:07.871 --> 29:10.332
Little George, pass.

29:10.374 --> 29:13.001
Oh, and look, here we have

29:10.374 --> 29:13.001
some Aunt Molly's Ice Cream.

29:13.043 --> 29:15.462
You'll notice there's no picture

29:13.043 --> 29:15.462
of Aunt Molly on the carton.

29:15.504 --> 29:18.173
I googled her and got a mug

29:15.504 --> 29:18.173
shot, and all I could think was

29:18.215 --> 29:19.841
"I hope she hasn't been

29:18.215 --> 29:19.841
selling that stuff to kids."

29:19.883 --> 29:21.801
Excuse me.

29:19.883 --> 29:21.801
Lorelai, what are you doing?

29:21.843 --> 29:23.262
Shopping, Taylor. Why?

29:23.303 --> 29:25.013
You're walking around

29:23.303 --> 29:25.013
disparaging my store

29:25.055 --> 29:27.391
and not only is that insulting,

29:25.055 --> 29:27.391
it's against the law.

29:27.433 --> 29:28.434
Against the law?

29:28.475 --> 29:31.228
Code 14/B/14

29:31.270 --> 29:33.480
triple backslash X-8

29:33.522 --> 29:35.649
'states that a citizen

29:33.522 --> 29:35.649
of Stars Hollow'

29:35.691 --> 29:37.359
cannot denigrate Stars Hollow

29:37.401 --> 29:40.279
while standing

29:37.401 --> 29:40.279
on Stars Hollow soil.

29:40.320 --> 29:42.448
It was established in 1792.

29:42.489 --> 29:45.075
The original penalty

29:42.489 --> 29:45.075
was death by 40 muskets.

29:45.117 --> 29:46.577
Really, Taylor,

29:45.117 --> 29:46.577
you misheard me.

29:46.619 --> 29:48.995
You made a crude joke

29:46.619 --> 29:48.995
about Aunt Molly.

29:49.037 --> 29:50.914
Well, you got to admit,

29:49.037 --> 29:50.914
Aunt Molly had it coming.

29:50.956 --> 29:53.833
- I don't joke about Aunt Molly.

29:50.956 --> 29:53.833
- Can you say BTK?

29:53.875 --> 29:56.336
As town mayor, I could

29:53.875 --> 29:56.336
cite you on the spot.

29:56.378 --> 29:58.422
- This is gropey McGee?

29:56.378 --> 29:58.422
- Shh, shh.

29:58.464 --> 29:59.839
I beg your pardon.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.508
Oh, look at the time.

29:59.881 --> 30:01.508
Excuse me, all, will you?

30:01.550 --> 30:02.926
M-mom, where you goin'?

30:02.968 --> 30:04.470
I'm just going to get

30:02.968 --> 30:04.470
something out of the car.

30:04.511 --> 30:06.012
No, mom. Mom, you don't

30:04.511 --> 30:06.012
know the safe streets.

30:06.054 --> 30:09.057
You walk down

30:06.054 --> 30:09.057
the wrong one, you die.

30:09.099 --> 30:11.351
Commence writing

30:09.099 --> 30:11.351
me up, Taylor.

30:11.393 --> 30:14.313
Benzedrine and a muscled fist

30:14.354 --> 30:15.981
turn to hand,

30:14.354 --> 30:15.981
turn to handout

30:16.022 --> 30:19.610
turned fish and loaves

30:16.022 --> 30:19.610
and a lazy day in Galilee.

30:19.652 --> 30:23.405
Herman Melville, poet,

30:19.652 --> 30:23.405
customs officer, rubber stamps

30:23.447 --> 30:25.282
'and Hawthorne daydreams'

30:25.324 --> 30:27.826
'craving Tahiti and simple sun'

30:27.867 --> 30:29.745
'and the light

30:27.867 --> 30:29.745
of the Berkshires.'

30:29.787 --> 30:31.204
- Is this any good?

30:29.787 --> 30:31.204
- Hmm.

30:31.246 --> 30:33.165
(Logan)

30:31.246 --> 30:33.165
'I don't know

30:31.246 --> 30:33.165
what she's gonna write.'

30:33.206 --> 30:34.792
(Jess)

30:33.206 --> 30:34.792
'We're not supposed to know

30:33.206 --> 30:34.792
what she's gonna write.'

30:34.833 --> 30:36.502
She's a member

30:34.833 --> 30:36.502
of the independent press.

30:36.543 --> 30:37.961
She played it

30:36.543 --> 30:37.961
so close to the vest

30:38.003 --> 30:39.463
you know, I hate that.

30:39.505 --> 30:42.341
Go get a beer.

30:39.505 --> 30:42.341
Stop obsessing.

30:42.382 --> 30:45.218
(male #1)

30:42.382 --> 30:45.218
'Too soon, the buzz saw

30:42.382 --> 30:45.218
cried a warning'

30:45.260 --> 30:47.346
'Too soon..'

30:47.387 --> 30:49.473
Well, isn't this

30:47.387 --> 30:49.473
a day of surprises?

30:50.932 --> 30:52.559
Too loud, the gun in the..

30:54.353 --> 30:55.479
I didn't RSVP.

30:54.353 --> 30:55.479
Sorry.

30:55.521 --> 30:58.231
Ah, this isn't

30:55.521 --> 30:58.231
an RSVP-type thing.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.192
- Showing up's cool.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.192
- Good thing.

31:00.233 --> 31:01.735
So this is Truncheon Books?

31:01.777 --> 31:05.071
- Yeah. This is Truncheon.

31:01.777 --> 31:05.071
- I like it.

31:05.113 --> 31:06.490
It makes me feel

31:05.113 --> 31:06.490
like I instantly

31:06.532 --> 31:07.741
want to create something.

31:07.783 --> 31:09.284
Give me a pen.

31:07.783 --> 31:09.284
Give me a brush.

31:09.326 --> 31:10.410
That's Luke.

31:10.452 --> 31:11.870
Yeah, there's a,

31:10.452 --> 31:11.870
there's a definite

31:11.911 --> 31:15.123
Jess Mariano, this is

31:11.911 --> 31:15.123
your life vibe here today.

31:15.165 --> 31:16.542
Hey, Luke.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.043
- Bicycle?

31:16.583 --> 31:18.043
- No.

31:18.084 --> 31:19.085
Rory, hi.

31:18.084 --> 31:19.085
What are you doing here?

31:19.127 --> 31:20.420
Same thing you're doing here.

31:20.462 --> 31:21.921
Your books are

31:20.462 --> 31:21.921
really easy to skim.

31:21.963 --> 31:23.382
Thanks. That'll make

31:21.963 --> 31:23.382
a nice blurb.

31:23.423 --> 31:25.050
I was gonna take off, actually.

31:25.091 --> 31:27.093
Uh, I got to get something.

31:25.091 --> 31:27.093
Don't leave till I get back.

31:27.135 --> 31:30.305
- I'll just be a minute

31:27.135 --> 31:30.305
- Okay.

31:30.347 --> 31:31.640
You have a great face.

31:31.682 --> 31:32.683
Thanks. So do you.

31:32.725 --> 31:35.519
Yeah, uh, Rory,

31:32.725 --> 31:35.519
this is April.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.271
Oh, April.

31:35.561 --> 31:38.271
Hello there, April.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.357
- Hi.

31:38.313 --> 31:40.357
- The famous April.

31:40.399 --> 31:41.608
- I'm famous?

31:40.399 --> 31:41.608
- Kind of.

31:41.650 --> 31:44.027
Uh, April,

31:41.650 --> 31:44.027
Rory's an old friend.

31:44.069 --> 31:45.404
She doesn't look old.

31:45.445 --> 31:47.781
I mean, I've known

31:45.445 --> 31:47.781
her well since..

31:47.823 --> 31:50.075
...she was your age.

31:47.823 --> 31:50.075
Uh, she's from Stars Hollow.

31:50.116 --> 31:52.160
(Luke)

31:50.116 --> 31:52.160
'She's actually the daughter

31:50.116 --> 31:52.160
of the woman I'm with'

31:52.202 --> 31:55.414
my<i> fiancee,</i> Lorelai.

31:52.202 --> 31:55.414
You met her that one time.

31:55.455 --> 31:58.500
- It's kind of complicated.

31:55.455 --> 31:58.500
- I'll say.

31:58.542 --> 31:59.543
You probably want

31:58.542 --> 31:59.543
to get back to that

31:59.585 --> 32:00.753
boyfriend of yours, right?

32:00.794 --> 32:03.505
He's not my boyfriend. Jeez.

32:03.547 --> 32:06.258
Hey, Luke, come here.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.801
Here.

32:07.843 --> 32:09.302
Oh, let me,

32:07.843 --> 32:09.302
let me buy this.

32:09.344 --> 32:10.470
So that way,

32:09.344 --> 32:10.470
you would get the money.

32:10.512 --> 32:11.764
Ah, it's okay.

32:11.805 --> 32:13.807
- What's this?

32:11.805 --> 32:13.807
- It's what's owed.

32:13.849 --> 32:15.141
You owe me nothing.

32:15.183 --> 32:16.976
I owe you. Take it.

32:17.018 --> 32:19.104
If you rip it up,

32:17.018 --> 32:19.104
I'm just gonna send another.

32:19.145 --> 32:20.980
[sighs]

32:21.022 --> 32:22.524
I'm very proud

32:21.022 --> 32:22.524
of you, of this

32:22.566 --> 32:24.192
of what you're going for here.

32:24.234 --> 32:26.904
I don't get all

32:24.234 --> 32:26.904
of it, but I'm me.

32:26.945 --> 32:28.071
Thanks.

32:29.989 --> 32:31.825
(April)

32:29.989 --> 32:31.825
'...all I said

32:29.989 --> 32:31.825
was that I liked him.'

32:31.867 --> 32:33.911
I realized it was a mistake

32:31.867 --> 32:33.911
as soon as I said it.

32:33.952 --> 32:35.495
We should get goin'.

32:35.537 --> 32:37.122
- Nice meeting you.

32:35.537 --> 32:37.122
- Nice meeting you, too.

32:37.163 --> 32:38.415
- Good luck with everything.

32:37.163 --> 32:38.415
- Good luck with this.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.083
- Congratulations.

32:38.457 --> 32:40.083
- Okay, thanks.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.126
- See ya.

32:40.125 --> 32:41.126
- Bye.

32:42.711 --> 32:44.546
[chuckles]

32:44.588 --> 32:46.298
So you here alone?

32:46.339 --> 32:47.466
I guess.

32:47.507 --> 32:49.217
Cool.

32:49.259 --> 32:50.218
Come on.

32:52.512 --> 32:54.973
Oh, well, we'll be lucky

32:52.512 --> 32:54.973
to get a table, huh.

32:55.014 --> 32:56.308
There's absolutely

32:55.014 --> 32:56.308
nowhere else to eat

32:56.349 --> 32:57.851
in town and even

32:56.349 --> 32:57.851
being Luke's<i> fiancee</i>

32:57.893 --> 32:59.937
doesn't guarantee me

32:57.893 --> 32:59.937
a meal when I want one.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.521
- Oh, great. More customers.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.521
- Hmm.

33:01.563 --> 33:03.106
Well, there seem to be

33:01.563 --> 33:03.106
a few tables available.

33:03.148 --> 33:04.817
None of the good ones,

33:03.148 --> 33:04.817
unfortunately.

33:04.858 --> 33:06.526
Alright, you phoned mom,

33:04.858 --> 33:06.526
you told her to meet us here.

33:06.568 --> 33:09.195
- What, is she late?

33:06.568 --> 33:09.195
- No, she's right there.

33:09.237 --> 33:11.490
Oh, alright. What is wrong

33:09.237 --> 33:11.490
with this picture?

33:11.531 --> 33:12.741
- They're playing cards.

33:11.531 --> 33:12.741
- Yes, I can see that.

33:12.783 --> 33:13.909
But, who is that

33:12.783 --> 33:13.909
she's playing with?

33:13.951 --> 33:15.076
(Richard)

33:13.951 --> 33:15.076
'I have no idea.'

33:15.118 --> 33:16.995
- Do they have ham here?

33:15.118 --> 33:16.995
- Ham? Sure.

33:17.036 --> 33:19.623
Get me a ham and Swiss on rye,

33:17.036 --> 33:19.623
dry, nothing on it.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.959
- But, where are you going?

33:19.665 --> 33:21.959
- I-I, I'll be back in a bit.

33:22.000 --> 33:24.294
Dad, wait, dad. What..

33:25.754 --> 33:28.632
- Do you have any 8s?

33:25.754 --> 33:28.632
- Go fish.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.176
Oh, you.

33:28.674 --> 33:31.176
I was sure you had 8s.

33:31.217 --> 33:33.011
- Hi, Lorelai.

33:31.217 --> 33:33.011
- Hi, mom. What you doin'?

33:33.052 --> 33:34.596
Oh, Cissy and I

33:33.052 --> 33:34.596
are playing go fish.

33:34.638 --> 33:35.889
She's good, too.

33:34.638 --> 33:35.889
It's your turn.

33:35.931 --> 33:38.725
- Do you have any jacks?

33:35.931 --> 33:38.725
- Unbelievable.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.811
She's won three games in a row.

33:38.767 --> 33:40.811
She's a little champ.

33:40.853 --> 33:42.813
- I keep getting lucky.

33:40.853 --> 33:42.813
- It's not luck.

33:42.855 --> 33:45.231
You said she was smart,

33:42.855 --> 33:45.231
but this is something else.

33:45.273 --> 33:46.942
- 'You get to go again.'

33:45.273 --> 33:46.942
- Oh, my God. Mom.

33:46.984 --> 33:50.195
- Do you have any 3s?

33:46.984 --> 33:50.195
- Nope. Go fish.

33:50.236 --> 33:51.780
Mom, who do you

33:50.236 --> 33:51.780
think this is?

33:51.822 --> 33:52.823
Luke's daughter.

33:52.865 --> 33:54.741
[sighs]

33:54.783 --> 33:56.201
- Isn't it?

33:54.783 --> 33:56.201
- No.

33:56.242 --> 33:58.203
- You're not Luke's daughter?

33:56.242 --> 33:58.203
- Uh-uh.

33:58.244 --> 34:00.121
I don't believe this.

33:58.244 --> 34:00.121
This isn't Luke's daughter?

34:00.163 --> 34:01.707
It's definitely

34:00.163 --> 34:01.707
not Luke's daughter.

34:01.748 --> 34:03.667
And here I was

34:01.748 --> 34:03.667
bonding with it.

34:03.709 --> 34:04.918
Who is this?

34:03.709 --> 34:04.918
Who are you?

34:04.960 --> 34:06.378
- Um.

34:04.960 --> 34:06.378
- Never mind, honey.

34:06.419 --> 34:08.087
- Do you live close by?

34:06.419 --> 34:08.087
- Two blocks.

34:08.129 --> 34:10.382
Okay. W-why don't you

34:08.129 --> 34:10.382
go home where it's safe?

34:10.423 --> 34:12.634
Okay.

34:12.676 --> 34:14.928
You're telling me,

34:12.676 --> 34:14.928
I played this insipid game

34:14.970 --> 34:16.722
for a half an hour and it's not

34:14.970 --> 34:16.722
even Luke's daughter?

34:16.763 --> 34:18.139
What made you think

34:16.763 --> 34:18.139
it was Luke's daughter?

34:18.181 --> 34:19.933
Well, it told me it was

34:18.181 --> 34:19.933
someone's daughter here.

34:19.975 --> 34:21.768
Well, she must have

34:19.975 --> 34:21.768
meant someone in town.

34:21.810 --> 34:23.186
Well, then she's a moron.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.354
Why would I play

34:23.228 --> 34:24.354
cards with her

34:24.396 --> 34:25.689
if there wasn't

34:24.396 --> 34:25.689
a family connection?

34:25.731 --> 34:27.649
I guess she just thought

34:25.731 --> 34:27.649
you were being nice.

34:27.691 --> 34:29.943
The little idiot kept tipping

34:27.691 --> 34:29.943
her cards so I could see them.

34:29.985 --> 34:31.862
So I pretended I didn't

34:29.985 --> 34:31.862
and specifically asked

34:31.904 --> 34:33.446
for what I knew

34:31.904 --> 34:33.446
she didn't have.

34:33.488 --> 34:35.323
- The kid's a moron.

34:33.488 --> 34:35.323
- Okay, mom. She's gone now.

34:35.365 --> 34:36.825
Is it so stupid

34:35.365 --> 34:36.825
to think that

34:36.867 --> 34:38.952
she's Luke's daughter?

34:36.867 --> 34:38.952
She looks like Luke.

34:38.994 --> 34:41.413
Mom, you can trust me

34:38.994 --> 34:41.413
that there will be no contact

34:41.454 --> 34:43.122
between you and Luke's daughter

34:41.454 --> 34:43.122
anytime soon.

34:43.164 --> 34:44.374
What does that mean?

34:44.416 --> 34:45.792
It means, that

34:44.416 --> 34:45.792
I don't even see her.

34:45.834 --> 34:47.126
Luke and I

34:45.834 --> 34:47.126
have an arrangement.

34:47.168 --> 34:48.294
What kind of arrangement?

34:48.336 --> 34:49.880
Well, he..

34:49.922 --> 34:52.507
I mean, you know,

34:49.922 --> 34:52.507
we mutually decided

34:52.549 --> 34:54.843
that I probably shouldn't

34:52.549 --> 34:54.843
have any contact with her.

34:54.885 --> 34:56.636
What? That's ridiculous.

34:56.678 --> 34:58.638
No, it is...what it is.

34:56.678 --> 34:58.638
It's what we want.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.974
Lorelai, you and Luke

34:58.680 --> 35:00.974
are in a relationship.

35:01.016 --> 35:03.351
You're going to be husband and

35:01.016 --> 35:03.351
wife, and Cissy's his daughter.

35:03.393 --> 35:05.437
No, no. That was Cissy.

35:03.393 --> 35:05.437
April is his daughter.

35:05.478 --> 35:06.479
You know what I mean.

35:06.521 --> 35:07.773
You have to have

35:06.521 --> 35:07.773
a relationship

35:07.814 --> 35:09.315
with this girl.

35:07.814 --> 35:09.315
It's imperative.

35:09.357 --> 35:10.734
Mom, you don't know

35:09.357 --> 35:10.734
the whole story.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.277
But I know your

35:10.776 --> 35:12.277
handiwork when I see it.

35:12.318 --> 35:14.446
Playing cautious

35:12.318 --> 35:14.446
when you should be diving in.

35:14.487 --> 35:16.239
'That girl

35:14.487 --> 35:16.239
is his blood relation'

35:16.281 --> 35:17.824
and you need

35:16.281 --> 35:17.824
to get to know her.

35:17.866 --> 35:19.826
You'll be in her life

35:17.866 --> 35:19.826
for the rest of your life.

35:19.868 --> 35:21.411
Mom, it isn't just me.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.496
I can't believe Luke is letting

35:21.453 --> 35:23.496
you get away with this.

35:23.538 --> 35:25.707
The sooner you embrace

35:23.538 --> 35:25.707
your role in this girl's life

35:25.749 --> 35:27.876
the better off you'll be,

35:25.749 --> 35:27.876
mark my words.

35:27.918 --> 35:30.253
- Where's your father?

35:27.918 --> 35:30.253
- He ran off to something.

35:30.295 --> 35:32.422
That's right. We had another

35:30.295 --> 35:32.422
appointment. I'll find him.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.967
Then, we have to leave.

35:32.464 --> 35:34.967
He needs to get back to work.

35:35.008 --> 35:37.343
- Alright, goodbye, mom.

35:35.008 --> 35:37.343
- Goodbye.

35:37.385 --> 35:41.014
You. You could have told me

35:37.385 --> 35:41.014
that wasn't Luke's daughter.

35:41.056 --> 35:42.975
I hate customers.

35:43.016 --> 35:46.436
♪ Aaa aaa ♪♪

35:46.478 --> 35:48.605
All I'm saying is,

35:46.478 --> 35:48.605
control your poet.

35:48.647 --> 35:51.357
- So suddenly he's my poet.

35:48.647 --> 35:51.357
- He changed up on us.

35:51.399 --> 35:53.735
He wasn't supposed to premiere

35:51.399 --> 35:53.735
new material tonight.

35:53.777 --> 35:55.153
- It wasn't bad.

35:53.777 --> 35:55.153
- It was rambling.

35:55.194 --> 35:56.195
It was a little rambling.

35:56.237 --> 35:57.280
And what was that whole part

35:57.322 --> 35:58.824
about desiring Golda Meir?

35:58.865 --> 36:01.493
Please tell me

35:58.865 --> 36:01.493
that was symbolic.

36:01.534 --> 36:04.245
I'll talk to my poet.

36:04.287 --> 36:05.747
Hey, we're

36:04.287 --> 36:05.747
hitting that bar

36:05.789 --> 36:08.249
that we're not going

36:05.789 --> 36:08.249
to call "Cedar Bar Redux."

36:08.291 --> 36:10.710
- You coming?

36:08.291 --> 36:10.710
- Yeah, maybe.

36:10.752 --> 36:13.672
You know, go on ahead.

36:10.752 --> 36:13.672
I'll catch up.

36:22.263 --> 36:24.265
You know, you don't

36:22.263 --> 36:24.265
have to read it again.

36:24.307 --> 36:25.767
I know I don't.

36:25.809 --> 36:27.393
God, there are so many things

36:25.809 --> 36:27.393
I would change in it.

36:27.435 --> 36:28.436
Like what?

36:28.478 --> 36:30.605
I'd keep the back cover.

36:30.647 --> 36:32.357
Everything else goes.

36:32.398 --> 36:33.984
- You know why I love your book?

36:32.398 --> 36:33.984
- Why?

36:34.026 --> 36:35.861
It doesn't remind

36:34.026 --> 36:35.861
me of anything.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.362
It's not a rip-off.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.362
It's just you.

36:37.403 --> 36:39.656
High praise,

36:37.403 --> 36:39.656
Miss Yale editor.

36:39.698 --> 36:42.159
Yeah, well, I don't get to

36:39.698 --> 36:42.159
write as much as I would like.

36:42.200 --> 36:44.369
I am mostly assigning

36:44.410 --> 36:46.746
and motivating,

36:44.410 --> 36:46.746
hand-holding and rewriting.

36:46.788 --> 36:48.373
Yeah, and you love it.

36:46.788 --> 36:48.373
Every minute of it.

36:48.414 --> 36:49.749
Come on,

36:48.414 --> 36:49.749
tell me you don't.

36:49.791 --> 36:53.128
I do. I do love it.

36:49.791 --> 36:53.128
It's exciting.

36:53.170 --> 36:55.380
Yeah, you look happier

36:53.170 --> 36:55.380
than when I saw you last.

36:55.421 --> 36:56.965
I am.

36:57.007 --> 37:00.093
So...you fixed everything?

37:00.135 --> 37:02.512
Yeah, everything's fixed.

37:02.554 --> 37:03.805
Good.

37:03.847 --> 37:05.682
I'm glad you're here.

37:05.724 --> 37:07.017
Yeah, me too.

37:16.818 --> 37:18.236
Uh...what?

37:18.277 --> 37:20.446
- Um, sorry.

37:18.277 --> 37:20.446
- A-about what?

37:20.488 --> 37:24.492
Uh, a-about coming

37:20.488 --> 37:24.492
here like this.

37:24.534 --> 37:26.161
I just got the flier

37:24.534 --> 37:26.161
and I don't know.

37:26.203 --> 37:29.330
I-I just wanted to see

37:26.203 --> 37:29.330
your place, but then this..

37:29.372 --> 37:31.041
It's not fair to you.

37:29.372 --> 37:31.041
I'm such a jerk.

37:31.083 --> 37:33.085
I-I don't, I don't know

37:31.083 --> 37:33.085
what you're talking about.

37:33.126 --> 37:35.253
And I couldn't even cheat

37:33.126 --> 37:35.253
on him the way he cheated on me.

37:35.294 --> 37:37.338
Who? Who cheated on y..

37:37.380 --> 37:38.548
That guy?

37:40.633 --> 37:42.552
[sighs]

37:44.262 --> 37:47.140
- You're still with him.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.140
- Yeah.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.934
I thought

37:47.182 --> 37:48.934
everything was fixed.

37:48.975 --> 37:50.268
Everything but him.

37:50.309 --> 37:52.604
- I hate this.

37:50.309 --> 37:52.604
- You should. I'm sorry.

37:52.645 --> 37:56.191
You came here alone

37:52.645 --> 37:56.191
to Philadelphia.

37:56.233 --> 37:57.316
He was out of town.

37:57.358 --> 37:58.651
I don't deserve this, Rory.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.779
No, you don't.

37:58.693 --> 38:00.779
You don't deserve it.

38:00.820 --> 38:02.906
I just..

38:02.948 --> 38:05.575
...I'm in love with him.

38:05.617 --> 38:07.577
Despite all the bad he's done,

38:05.617 --> 38:07.577
I-I can't help it.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.371
I'm in love with him.

38:10.413 --> 38:12.249
Love, huh?

38:12.290 --> 38:13.458
Yeah.

38:17.545 --> 38:19.005
I guess I'll call

38:17.545 --> 38:19.005
Matthew's poet

38:19.047 --> 38:20.673
and have him

38:19.047 --> 38:20.673
explain love to me.

38:20.715 --> 38:22.717
Poets know

38:20.715 --> 38:22.717
all about it, right?

38:22.759 --> 38:24.094
They're supposed to.

38:26.471 --> 38:28.723
Well, I guess,

38:26.471 --> 38:28.723
I guess I better go.

38:28.765 --> 38:30.183
Okay.

38:30.225 --> 38:32.144
I'm so sorry

38:30.225 --> 38:32.144
I came here.

38:32.185 --> 38:34.020
I'm not.

38:34.062 --> 38:36.397
It's what it is, you, me..

38:38.275 --> 38:39.276
Where did you park?

38:39.317 --> 38:41.027
I'm, I'm right outside.

38:44.114 --> 38:48.034
Hey, if, uh, if it

38:44.114 --> 38:48.034
makes you feel better

38:48.076 --> 38:51.746
you can always tell him

38:48.076 --> 38:51.746
that we did something.

38:51.788 --> 38:52.956
Thanks, Jess.

38:57.418 --> 38:58.586
You know

38:57.418 --> 38:58.586
what I thought, I thought

38:58.628 --> 38:59.754
an apple stop

38:58.628 --> 38:59.754
would be fun today.

38:59.796 --> 39:01.006
Ooh, great idea.

39:01.047 --> 39:02.632
The banana stop

39:01.047 --> 39:02.632
was a big hit yesterday.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.217
I don't see how an

39:02.674 --> 39:04.217
apple stop could fail.

39:04.259 --> 39:05.885
Yeah, they loved

39:04.259 --> 39:05.885
the banana stop.

39:05.927 --> 39:07.304
So I have these pamphlets

39:05.927 --> 39:07.304
for the kids to read

39:07.345 --> 39:09.181
about Amish country.

39:07.345 --> 39:09.181
Should we hand them out now?

39:09.222 --> 39:10.974
- I think that's a good idea.

39:09.222 --> 39:10.974
- Oh, I'll do it.

39:11.016 --> 39:12.517
I've got something

39:11.016 --> 39:12.517
for April here

39:12.558 --> 39:14.227
so I was about

39:12.558 --> 39:14.227
to sneak back there anyway.

39:14.269 --> 39:15.603
Thank you, Luke.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.274
Hey, everybody.

39:17.689 --> 39:19.274
Sorry to interrupt.

39:19.316 --> 39:21.860
I got some pamphlets here,

39:19.316 --> 39:21.860
a little info on Amish country.

39:21.901 --> 39:23.486
It's got some pictures,

39:21.901 --> 39:23.486
but we're gonna see it

39:23.528 --> 39:24.821
so you don't have

39:23.528 --> 39:24.821
to look at the pictures.

39:24.863 --> 39:26.281
It's got stuff to read, too.

39:26.323 --> 39:28.616
So go ahead and pass

39:26.323 --> 39:28.616
the rest around there.

39:28.658 --> 39:31.410
I thought you might

39:28.658 --> 39:31.410
need your sweater.

39:31.452 --> 39:34.122
Okay, then. See ya.

39:34.164 --> 39:36.415
My dad's ridiculously

39:34.164 --> 39:36.415
overprotective.

39:36.457 --> 39:38.126
Ridiculously.
