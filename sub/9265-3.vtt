05:11.311 --> 05:12.312
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

05:12.312 --> 05:15.148

08:25.839 --> 08:26.965
TO COME GIVE SOME
OF THEIR MONEY AWAY.

08:27.006 --> 08:29.801
NEAT.
YEAH, THAT'S ME.

08:29.843 --> 08:30.844
HUH.

08:30.844 --> 08:33.138
NOW, WHAT'S A LITTLE
THING LIKE YOU

08:33.179 --> 08:34.764
DOING WITH 20 RACKS OF RIBS?

08:34.806 --> 08:36.182
OH, IT'S A LONG STORY.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.518
MY‐‐YOU KNOW.
MY HUSBAND...

08:38.518 --> 08:39.519
[clears throat]

08:39.519 --> 08:42.188
DON'T MAKE IT OBVIOUS.

08:42.188 --> 08:46.109
7:00...CREEP.

08:47.861 --> 08:50.321
DON'T MAKE IT
OBVIOUS.

08:50.363 --> 08:51.948
TIM, STOP.

08:51.990 --> 08:54.200
SERIOUSLY,
I CAN'T FOCUS.

08:54.200 --> 08:55.535
IT'S A LIBRARY.

08:55.535 --> 08:56.786
I KNOW IT'S A LIBRARY.

08:56.828 --> 08:58.788
I‐‐NO.

08:58.830 --> 09:00.248
NO, YOU WIN, BUDDY.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.249
HE WINS.
NO, WAIT.

09:01.249 --> 09:02.250
TIM, STOP.

09:02.250 --> 09:03.960
PLEASE?

09:04.002 --> 09:05.879
YOU'RE GONNA
WORK ON THIS THING,

09:05.879 --> 09:08.048
AND YOU'RE GONNA
ACE THESE TESTS.

09:08.048 --> 09:11.134
AND YOU'RE GONNA
IMPROVE YOUR GRADES,

09:11.176 --> 09:13.887
AND YOU'RE GONNA
GET A SCHOLARSHIP...

09:13.887 --> 09:16.347
AND WE'RE GONNA
GO TO COLLEGES

09:16.389 --> 09:18.475
THAT ARE REALLY,
REALLY CLOSE TO‐‐

09:18.516 --> 09:21.811
YOU ARE COMING OVER
TOMORROW NIGHT, CORRECT?

09:21.853 --> 09:23.146
MINDY AND ANGELA
ARE‐‐

09:23.188 --> 09:25.398
OKAY, NO MINDY.
WHAT? NO.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.567
SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
KNOW THIS OR NOT,

09:27.567 --> 09:30.236
BUT MINDY AND ANGELA
HATE ME.

09:30.236 --> 09:31.321
WHAT?

09:31.362 --> 09:33.990
NO, THEY DON'T HATE YOU.

09:34.032 --> 09:35.241
OKAY.
THEY DON'T EVEN
KNOW YOU.

09:35.241 --> 09:36.242
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:36.242 --> 09:38.244
IF THEY DID,
THEY'D LOVE YOU.

09:38.244 --> 09:40.246
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:40.288 --> 09:43.124
SOMEBODY...

09:43.124 --> 09:44.918
WANTS HIS GIRLFRIEND
TO BE THERE.

09:44.918 --> 09:46.086
OKAY?
OKAY.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.170
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

09:47.212 --> 09:48.880
IF THEY EVEN
LOOK AT YOU WRONG,

09:48.922 --> 09:50.507
AND YOU DON'T SEE IT,
AND I DO,

09:50.548 --> 09:53.510
I'M GONNA BLINDSIDE THEM
WITH THE WORST...

09:53.551 --> 09:54.928
BLOCK THEY HAVE
EVER SEEN.

09:54.928 --> 09:56.888
OKAY.
MM‐HMM.

09:56.930 --> 09:58.598
SO WHAT I WANT...

09:58.598 --> 09:59.933
FROM YOU RIGHT NOW

09:59.933 --> 10:02.435
IS FOR YOU TO SAY,
"YES, TIM,

10:02.435 --> 10:04.104
"I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU

10:04.104 --> 10:05.605
AND HANG OUT WITH YOU
TOMORROW NIGHT."

10:05.605 --> 10:07.440
I JUST‐‐THAT'S WHAT
I WANT FROM YOU.

10:07.440 --> 10:10.193
SO...JUST GIVE ME
THAT...MUCH.

10:10.235 --> 10:12.112
[giggling]
YES.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.196
MMM, THAT'S PERFECT.

10:13.238 --> 10:14.614
[both giggling]

10:14.614 --> 10:15.448
OKAY.

10:15.490 --> 10:17.534
OKAY, REALLY, STILL?
YOU'RE STILL THERE‐‐

10:17.575 --> 10:18.576
SHH, SHH.

10:18.618 --> 10:21.121
[door opens]

10:21.121 --> 10:22.163
HONEY?

10:22.163 --> 10:23.623
HEY, BABE.

10:23.665 --> 10:25.416
HEY, HONEY.
GUESS WHAT.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.627
I JUST MET KATIE MCCOY...

10:27.627 --> 10:29.295
AT THE GROCERY STORE.

10:29.295 --> 10:30.463
YOU KNOW, JOE MCCOY'S WIFE.

10:30.463 --> 10:31.464
MM‐HMM.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.883
AND SHE IS SO NICE.

10:33.925 --> 10:35.969
I THINK SHE'S GONNA BE
REALLY A GREAT ASSET TO DILLON.

10:35.969 --> 10:37.053
HI.
MM‐HMM. HI.

10:37.095 --> 10:38.638
AND THE BEST PART IS

10:38.638 --> 10:40.640
SHE HAS AGREED TO DO THE WHOLE
BARBECUE AT THEIR HOUSE.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.100
DONE AND DONE.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.269
DON'T EAT THOSE SAD BEANS.
I BROUGHT MARCELLO'S.

10:44.310 --> 10:45.603
I DON'T WANT MARCELLO'S.

10:45.645 --> 10:47.647
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY
ABOUT THE BARBECUE?

10:47.647 --> 10:49.983
I WAS TELLING HER HOW, UM,
YOU KNOW, DIFFICULT IT'S BEEN

10:49.983 --> 10:50.733
AND HOW MUCH WORK IT'S BEEN

10:50.775 --> 10:51.943
AND HOW I DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR IT.

10:51.985 --> 10:54.112
YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
AND SHE SAID
JUST LIKE THAT, SHE SAID,

10:54.154 --> 10:56.614
"WHY DON'T I TAKE IT
OFF YOUR HANDS FOR YOU?"

10:56.656 --> 10:57.657
EXPLAIN SOMETHING TO ME:

10:57.699 --> 11:02.328
HOW CAN WE BE A HOST
OF OUR BARBECUE AT THEIR HOUSE?

11:02.328 --> 11:03.663
ISN'T THE DEFINITION
OF HOSTING

11:03.663 --> 11:06.291
WHEN YOU HAVE SOMETHING
AT YOUR OWN HOUSE?

11:06.332 --> 11:09.419
WELL...I THINK
IT'S LIKE CO‐HOSTING.

11:09.460 --> 11:11.004
WHAT THE HELL?
CO‐HOSTING?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.297
THIS IS MY BARBECUE.

11:12.338 --> 11:14.007
WELL, IT'S FUNNY
THAT YOU SAY THAT,

11:14.007 --> 11:16.342
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN THE ONE
DOING ALL THE WORK,

11:16.342 --> 11:18.678
BUT...YOU KNOW.

11:18.678 --> 11:20.096
THIS TIME OF YEAR,
THERE'S A LOT OF SCRUTINY

11:20.138 --> 11:21.598
GOING ON WITH THE TEAM
AND MYSELF,

11:21.639 --> 11:23.516
AND I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW
THAT I DON'T PLAN TO BE

11:23.516 --> 11:24.976
IN SOMEONE ELSE'S HOUSE
TO BE SCRUTINIZED.

11:25.018 --> 11:26.644
I'M GONNA BE RIGHT HERE
IN MY OWN HOUSE THIS YEAR.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.645
RIGHT HERE.

11:27.687 --> 11:29.480
WELL, HONEY, YOU KNOW,
YOU ARE NOT THE ONLY ONE

11:29.522 --> 11:31.357
AROUND HERE
WHO'S BEING SCRUTINIZED.

11:31.357 --> 11:33.026
AND I, FRANKLY,
WOULD RATHER NOT

11:33.026 --> 11:34.360
BE SCRUTINIZED
IN MY OWN HOUSE.

11:34.360 --> 11:35.528
AND I'M SURPRISED YOU'RE
HAVING THIS REACTION.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.155
JUST THIS MORNING,

11:37.197 --> 11:38.198
YOU SAID THAT WE COULD
DO THE BARBECUE SOMEWHERE ELSE.

11:38.239 --> 11:40.366
YEAH, NEXT YEAR I SAID
WE COULD DO IT SOMEWHERE ELSE.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.367
AND I WAS PRETTY MUCH
JUST TELLING YOU

11:41.367 --> 11:42.702
WHAT YOU WANTED
TO HEAR ANYWAY.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.537
AND ANOTHER THING IS,
AS FAR AS THIS BARBECUE,

11:44.537 --> 11:46.039
IT'S NOT JUST
IMPORTANT TO ME.

11:46.080 --> 11:48.249
IT'S A SYMBOL OF TRUST
TO HAVE THE KIDS OVER HERE

11:48.249 --> 11:49.167
AT THE HOUSE

11:49.209 --> 11:51.211
SO THEY CAN BE IN OUR HOME
AND FEEL WELCOME.

11:51.211 --> 11:52.503
AND WHAT THE FACT
OF THE MATTER IS,

11:52.545 --> 11:53.546
YOU'RE BEING PLAYED
RIGHT NOW,

11:53.546 --> 11:54.547
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
REALIZE IT.

11:54.547 --> 11:55.340
OH, COME ON,
THAT IS SILLY.

11:55.381 --> 11:56.966
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT THAT MEANS.

11:57.008 --> 11:57.967
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT IT MEANS.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.469
IT MEANS SCOTCH,
IT MEANS CIGARS,

11:59.510 --> 12:00.553
IT MEANS NOW THEY GOT
THE PARTIES.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.638
AND THE NEXT THING
YOU KNOW,

12:01.679 --> 12:03.056
WE ARE GONNA BE
INDEBTED TO THEM.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.224
AND I DON'T WANT TO BE
INDEBTED TO THEM.

12:04.224 --> 12:05.683
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.393
[baby crying]

12:07.393 --> 12:10.647
I'M NOT BEING PLAYED.

12:10.688 --> 12:12.315
SHE'S NICE.

12:15.735 --> 12:16.736
SET!

12:16.736 --> 12:18.071
HEAD UP INSIDE.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.072
[shouting]

12:19.072 --> 12:20.573
LET'S GO!

12:20.573 --> 12:21.616
HUT!

12:23.743 --> 12:25.620
OH, COME ON, MATT.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.625
MATT.
SPRINT RELEASE.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.252
COME ON, NOW,
SPRINT RELEASE.
YES, SIR.

12:32.252 --> 12:33.586
HUT!

12:33.586 --> 12:34.712
SQUARE DOWN, BABY!

12:34.754 --> 12:35.588
THERE IT IS!
THERE IT IS!

12:35.630 --> 12:38.049
(Eric)
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:38.091 --> 12:39.509
MATT...

12:39.550 --> 12:40.927
YOU'RE SHORT‐ARMING IT.

12:40.927 --> 12:41.844
LOOSEN UP.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.097
HEY, LET'S LOOSEN UP
OUT HERE, HAVE SOME FUN.

12:44.097 --> 12:45.265
LET'S GO!

12:45.265 --> 12:46.849
COME ON, NOW, LET'S
HAVE SOME FUN OUT HERE.

12:46.891 --> 12:47.934
LET'S PLAY SOME FOOTBALL!

12:47.934 --> 12:49.769
LET'S GO, BABY,
LOOK ALIVE!

12:49.769 --> 12:52.772
MAYBE WE OUGHT TO GIVE
OL' J. D. A FEW REPS HERE,

12:52.772 --> 12:54.065
JUST IN CASE.

12:54.107 --> 12:55.942
MATT'LL TAKE THE REPS.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.111
I'M JUST SAYING‐‐
MATT'LL TAKE THE REPS.

12:58.111 --> 12:59.779
HEY, LOOK, COACH,

12:59.779 --> 13:01.781
IT'S MY JOB ON THE LINE
HERE TOO.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.616
NOW, I'M NOT
LOOKING FORWARD TO U‐HAUL

13:03.616 --> 13:05.952
AND "FOR SALE" SIGNS
IN MY YARD IF WE LOSE TOO.

13:05.952 --> 13:07.120
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.913
[cheers and applause]

13:08.997 --> 13:11.749
WELL, I'LL BEAR THAT
IN MIND, MAC.

13:12.959 --> 13:14.043
FINE.

13:17.964 --> 13:22.135
(Saracen)
I'M TRYING TO FIGHT
THIS MEDIA MACHINE, J. D. MCCOY.

13:22.135 --> 13:24.637
HE'S GOT, LIKE,
A THREE‐PAGE SPREAD IN HERE.

13:24.637 --> 13:27.098
(Landry)
WELL, IT'S THE FRESHMAN
PREVIEW, SO THAT MAKES SENSE.

13:27.140 --> 13:28.808
PEOPLE LIKE THIS.

13:28.808 --> 13:30.059
PEOPLE WANT
TO ATTACH TO THIS.

13:30.101 --> 13:31.060
I DON'T WANNA
HEAR ABOUT‐‐

13:31.102 --> 13:32.061
AND YOU DON'T
HAVE AN ANGLE.

13:32.103 --> 13:33.146
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING.

13:33.146 --> 13:35.732
CAN YOU PLEASE‐‐
JUST GO AWAY.
YOU'RE MATT SARACEN.

13:35.773 --> 13:36.899
PEOPLE KNOW
WHO YOU ARE.

13:36.941 --> 13:37.859
THEY KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA BRING.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.986
AND, MATT, I'M JUST
TRYING TO HELP YOU HERE.

13:39.986 --> 13:42.739
HIS ANGLE IS THAT
HE'S YOUNG, HE'S NEW.

13:42.780 --> 13:43.823
I DON'T NEED AN ANGLE.
HE'S HIP.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.116
WHO CARES?
NO ONE CARES.

13:45.158 --> 13:46.617
HE'S NOT HIP.
HE'S NOT HIP.

13:46.659 --> 13:48.077
HAVE YOU HEARD HIM TALK?
HE'S NOT HIP.

13:48.119 --> 13:49.078
HELLO.
HOW ARE YOU?

13:49.120 --> 13:50.121
I'M OKAY.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.706
YOU DON'T CARE.
I DON'T.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.207
I'LL LEAVE THIS HERE.

13:53.207 --> 13:54.709
IF YOU WANT TO.
I'LL GO GET A COKE.

13:54.709 --> 13:56.252
I DON'T EVEN‐‐
JULIE, HOW YOU DOING?

13:56.294 --> 13:57.962
I'M GOOD.

13:58.004 --> 13:59.005
THAT'S GOOD.

13:59.005 --> 14:00.089
WELL, SEE YOU LATER.

14:00.131 --> 14:01.758
BYE.

14:01.799 --> 14:03.009
WHAT'S UP WITH HIM?

14:03.009 --> 14:04.969
HE'S AN IDIOT.
HE'S STUPID.

14:08.139 --> 14:09.682
OOH, HALF‐EATEN TACOS.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.350
OH, YEAH, THOSE
ARE ALL YOU RIGHT THERE.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.603
HE WON'T MIND.
HE DOESN'T WANT THEM.

14:13.644 --> 14:15.313
I'M...I'M GOOD.

14:19.692 --> 14:23.112
UH...SO, UM...

14:23.154 --> 14:25.031
BIG GAME FRIDAY.

14:25.031 --> 14:26.783
OH, IT'S HUGE.

14:29.702 --> 14:30.536
ENORMOUS.

14:30.536 --> 14:33.998
YEAH, IT MIGHT
ALTER MY LIFE, IN FACT.

14:36.042 --> 14:37.710
BAD SUBJECT MATTER?

14:37.710 --> 14:41.047
WELL, THERE'S NO‐‐
IT'S JUST...

14:41.047 --> 14:43.800
I'M JUST STARTING TO WORRY ABOUT
BEATING ARNETT MEAD ON FRIDAY.

14:43.841 --> 14:45.176
THAT'S ALL I WANNA BE
THINKING ABOUT, OKAY?

14:45.218 --> 14:46.803
AND THAT'S HARD.

14:46.844 --> 14:49.722
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'RE AWARE,
BUT WE NEVER BEAT ARNETT MEAD.

14:49.722 --> 14:53.059
I MEAN, NOT EVEN JASON STREET
EVER BEAT ARNETT MEAD, EVER.

14:53.059 --> 14:54.727
OKAY? SO I'M TRYING
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

14:54.727 --> 14:57.355
MEANTIME, I GOT SOME
FRESHMAN NAMED JOE DOYLE

14:57.396 --> 14:59.148
BREATHING DOWN MY NECK,
AND HE'S...

14:59.190 --> 15:01.317
LOOK, IF I HEAR ANYONE
TALK ABOUT THIS 70‐YARD PASS

15:01.359 --> 15:02.985
HE THREW,
LIKE, EVER AGAIN,

15:03.027 --> 15:05.029
I'M GONNA LOSE IT,
BECAUSE I DON'T EVEN CARE.

15:05.071 --> 15:05.822
IT WAS IN PRACTICE.

15:05.863 --> 15:06.948
IT WASN'T DEFENDERS
OR WASN'T NOTH‐‐

15:06.989 --> 15:09.158
I COULD THROW A BALL 70 YARDS
IF NO ONE'S RUNNING AT ME.

15:09.200 --> 15:12.245
IT'S HARDER TO DO...

15:12.245 --> 15:14.122
SORRY, YOU DON'T CARE
ABOUT THIS.

15:14.122 --> 15:15.790
NO, I DO CARE.
I ASKED.

15:15.790 --> 15:16.958
YOU DON'T
AND YOU SHOULDN'T.

15:16.958 --> 15:18.042
I'M JUST‐‐
I'M JUST RANTING.

15:18.084 --> 15:20.086
I APOLOGIZE.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.047
YOU'RE REALLY ADORABLE
WHEN YOU RANT.

15:23.089 --> 15:24.757
THANKS.

15:27.260 --> 15:30.012
YOU GONNA EAT
YOUR TACOS?

15:30.054 --> 15:32.390
I DIDN'T COME OVER HERE
TO EAT TACOS.

15:47.905 --> 15:49.782
MR. POLLARD.

15:49.782 --> 15:50.950
WHAT'S UP?

15:50.950 --> 15:51.951
WELL, I CAME HERE
TO SEE YOU.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.370
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU
THOUGHT ABOUT A FUTURE

15:54.412 --> 15:55.997
WITH ALAMO FREEZE.

15:55.997 --> 15:59.167
[chuckles]

15:59.167 --> 16:01.961
