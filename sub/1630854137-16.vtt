- If your best friend
of 14 years

11:25.249 --> 11:29.471
was trying to goad some S&M guy
to meet her at a hotel,

11:29.514 --> 11:32.387
wouldn't you try to stop her?

11:32.430 --> 11:35.042
- So when did she tell you
that she'd been raped?

11:35.085 --> 11:37.740
- A few hours ago,
after Richard left for work.

11:37.784 --> 11:40.134
I guess she wanted
to keep it secret.

11:40.177 --> 11:42.310
- That's normal.

11:42.353 --> 11:45.792
- [sighs] I feel awful.

11:45.835 --> 11:47.315
You know, I'm the one
who pushed her

11:47.358 --> 11:49.273
to get back out on the market.

11:49.317 --> 11:51.754
And it's a sad thought,

11:51.798 --> 11:54.714
but my marriage
is pretty boring.

11:54.757 --> 11:56.454
[pensive music]

11:56.498 --> 11:59.849
I think I just wanted to
live vicariously through her.

12:02.722 --> 12:05.289
- Well, you know,
life is such an odd mix

12:05.333 --> 12:07.727
of beauty and pain, right?

12:07.770 --> 12:10.512
We can't control
how that unfolds

12:10.555 --> 12:14.603
for the people that we love,
much less ourselves.

12:14.646 --> 12:15.735
- Hmm.

12:17.780 --> 12:20.348
- Take care.

12:20.391 --> 12:21.915
- Thank you.

12:21.958 --> 12:24.134
SANE nurse put a rush
on Zoe's kit.

12:24.178 --> 12:25.745
Found signs of bruising,
trauma.

12:25.788 --> 12:28.530
- But the hot shower she took
must've washed away any DNA.

12:28.573 --> 12:30.140
- What about the clothes
that Jenna brought in?

12:30.184 --> 12:32.664
- Lab was able to recover semen
from the lingerie.

12:32.708 --> 12:34.710
- That confirms this story.
That's good news.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.146
- M.E.'s running it
through CODIS.

12:36.190 --> 12:38.801
- All right, and what
do we know about Klaus Darcy?

12:38.845 --> 12:41.325
- Hotel room
was paid for by Zoe.

12:41.369 --> 12:42.849
- That's a bit odd
for some stud, isn't it?

12:42.892 --> 12:45.503
- Well, maybe the wife
sees his credit card bills.

12:45.547 --> 12:46.809
- Seems to be a lot of history

12:46.853 --> 12:49.072
between Jenna's husband
and Zoe.

12:49.116 --> 12:51.205
Another woman lives
in their house for a year,

12:51.248 --> 12:52.815
Richard starts to fantasize.

12:52.859 --> 12:54.077
- So he what?

12:54.121 --> 12:55.992
Raped her to knock it
off his bucket list?

12:56.036 --> 12:58.429
- You can't underestimate
the power of sexual fantasy.

12:58.473 --> 13:00.475
Sometimes it adds
to the initial momentum

13:00.518 --> 13:01.563
of sex crimes.

13:01.606 --> 13:02.869
- Yeah, I got a fantasy.

13:02.912 --> 13:04.218
It involves you going
back up to the Bronx.

13:04.261 --> 13:06.481
- Whoa, Muncy. Take it easy.

13:06.524 --> 13:07.656
- You're pissed
about your friend.

13:07.699 --> 13:08.875
- Yeah, I am,
'cause you recorded him

13:08.918 --> 13:10.398
without his knowledge.

13:10.441 --> 13:11.529
- I get it.
You're loyal to him.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.096
- Wanna give them both
a time out?

13:13.140 --> 13:15.142
- No. I have a better idea.

13:15.185 --> 13:16.883
Churlish,
go talk to Jenna's husband

13:16.926 --> 13:19.059
and find out
if he had an alibi.

13:19.102 --> 13:20.495
- Copy that, Captain.

13:20.538 --> 13:21.888
- Muncy, what about
the dating website?

13:21.931 --> 13:24.455
- Burner cell phone,
fake email address.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.675
The guy never graduated
from the free trial period

13:26.718 --> 13:29.112
of the dating app, so I can't
check it with a credit card.

13:29.156 --> 13:30.461
Zoe was his only match.

13:30.505 --> 13:31.898
I did do
a reverse image search.

13:31.941 --> 13:33.073
- And?

13:33.116 --> 13:34.857
- And the picture
was copied off a website

13:34.901 --> 13:37.425
of some river raft
excursion guide in Sweden.

13:37.468 --> 13:39.557
- This perp is trying hard
to stay anonymous.

13:39.601 --> 13:41.081
- Yeah, I did call and confirm
the Swedish guy's

13:41.124 --> 13:42.343
never even been stateside.

13:42.386 --> 13:43.910
- Look, if he went
to all this trouble,

13:43.953 --> 13:46.956
he also must have worked hard
to target Zoe.

13:47.000 --> 13:48.305
- Yeah.

13:48.349 --> 13:51.526
- Has--does Zoe have
any issues with men?

13:51.569 --> 13:53.397
Relationship problems?
Coworkers?

13:53.441 --> 13:55.530
- The way Zoe tells it, no.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.924
- Okay, well,
canvass her building,

13:57.967 --> 14:01.579
her neighborhood, coworkers,
and scrub her social media.

14:01.623 --> 14:02.667
- On it, Captain.

14:02.711 --> 14:05.975
- Hey, Liv,
lab found a DNA match.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.020
- The guy's in the system?

14:07.063 --> 14:09.849
- It's a familial match.

14:09.892 --> 14:11.024
- To who?

14:11.067 --> 14:12.895
- Zoe's dead husband.

14:12.939 --> 14:16.072
[tense music]

14:21.077 --> 14:21.295
.

14:21.338 --> 14:23.645
- My husband was
arrested in college.

14:23.688 --> 14:25.081
- So you knew about it?

14:25.125 --> 14:26.778
- He stole a keg
from the freezer

14:26.822 --> 14:28.780
of a liquor store
he worked in for a party.

14:28.824 --> 14:30.304
- Okay.

14:30.347 --> 14:33.437
- So that's how his DNA
is in the police database?

14:33.481 --> 14:35.875
- In 2010,
New York started taking

14:35.918 --> 14:38.312
DNA samples for misdemeanors.

14:38.355 --> 14:43.056
- And the DNA on my rape kit
is somehow a match to Brian's?

14:43.099 --> 14:44.448
- Well,
it's a familial match,

14:44.492 --> 14:47.538
which means
it's a male relative.

14:47.582 --> 14:52.543
- You're saying Klaus
is related to my dead husband?

14:52.587 --> 14:53.805
That's impossible.

14:53.849 --> 14:55.546
Brian wasn't Swedish.

14:55.590 --> 14:57.940
- Well, the funny thing is,

14:57.984 --> 15:00.987
Klaus isn't even Klaus.

15:02.379 --> 15:04.947
- So Zoe, um,

15:04.991 --> 15:08.908
we need a list of your
husband's male relatives.

15:08.951 --> 15:11.084
- I haven't talked
to the majority of them

15:11.127 --> 15:12.346
since the funeral.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.478
- Well, I'm sure
you remember their names?

15:14.522 --> 15:18.221
- I was only ever close
with his nephew, um,

15:18.265 --> 15:20.354
Brian's older sister's kid.

15:20.397 --> 15:21.355
- What's his name?

15:21.398 --> 15:22.182
- Cooper.

15:22.225 --> 15:23.705
- But he's just a kid.

15:23.748 --> 15:26.055
He's 23 years old.

15:26.099 --> 15:28.057
- Cooper.
- No.

15:28.101 --> 15:29.276
Absolutely not.

15:29.319 --> 15:31.147
No, I would know
if it were him.

15:31.191 --> 15:34.063
- Can you say that
with 100% certainty?

15:34.107 --> 15:37.501
I mean, you said that you
were blindfolded in the dark,

15:37.545 --> 15:41.679
and Klaus only spoke to you
in a whisper.

15:41.723 --> 15:43.681
[suspenseful music]

15:43.725 --> 15:45.422
- Oh, I feel like puking.

15:45.466 --> 15:47.163
- When's the last time
you saw Cooper?

15:47.207 --> 15:49.209
- I take him to dinner
from time to time...

15:49.252 --> 15:51.472
[stammers]
Just to try and stay in touch.

15:51.515 --> 15:54.170
He's a--he's a
med school student.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.651
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

15:56.694 --> 15:58.696
I never should have
gone on that website.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.612
I feel like I'm losing control
over my life.

16:01.656 --> 16:03.136
I just--
- Okay. All right.

16:03.179 --> 16:06.139
- I just wanted
to reclaim myself.

16:06.182 --> 16:09.055
I don't--I don't want
his nephew arrested.

16:09.098 --> 16:10.795
- All right,
one step at a time.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.493
So first of all,

16:12.536 --> 16:14.234
all we're gonna do
is talk to him.

16:14.277 --> 16:17.019
And whatever happens
after that,

16:17.063 --> 16:19.543
you will be part
of the decision.

16:22.720 --> 16:23.983
- Okay.

16:26.072 --> 16:27.203
- Okay.

16:29.901 --> 16:31.033
- Wait.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.730
Aunt Zoe he was assaulted
and told you

16:32.774 --> 16:34.297
I'm the one that did it?

16:34.341 --> 16:36.952
- Well, she didn't say that,
but DNA is hard to argue with.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.475
- Where were you
two nights ago?

16:38.519 --> 16:40.912
- I was studying.
Ask my friends.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.436
- Let me see your phone.

16:47.180 --> 16:48.746
No dating apps.

16:48.790 --> 16:49.965
- I live in a co-ed dorm.

16:50.009 --> 16:51.532
- You might have deleted it.

16:51.575 --> 16:53.316
- Look, my Aunt Zoe and I
are really close.

16:53.360 --> 16:55.144
- Yeah, the question is,
how close?

16:55.188 --> 16:56.928
- Ew. She's my aunt.

16:56.972 --> 16:58.278
It's only hot in porn.

16:58.321 --> 16:59.844
- Well, you forget one thing.

16:59.888 --> 17:01.846
There's a DNA connection
to you.

17:01.890 --> 17:03.413
- So we're gonna need a sample.

17:03.457 --> 17:04.893
- Wait.

17:04.935 --> 17:07.026
I'm guessing it was seminal
fluid you found on her?

17:07.069 --> 17:08.069
- That's right.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.376
- I'm a donor.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.856
Past two years,
a really popular one.

17:11.900 --> 17:14.294
- Yeah, tall, blue eyes,
med student.

17:14.337 --> 17:15.382
I'm sure you do all right.

17:15.425 --> 17:17.079
- Make 1,500 bucks a month.

17:17.123 --> 17:19.255
- Someone hit
the genetic lottery.

17:19.299 --> 17:20.734
- It helps me pay my way
through school.

17:20.778 --> 17:22.214
- Okay, well, any chance
you might know who

17:22.258 --> 17:24.391
had access to your donation?

17:24.434 --> 17:25.869
- It's all confidential.
- Okay.

17:25.914 --> 17:28.786
Well, then we're still
gonna need that swab, man.

17:28.830 --> 17:32.312
Unfortunately, this one
doesn't pay at all.

17:32.355 --> 17:33.617
Open up.

17:33.661 --> 17:34.662
Come on.

17:36.794 --> 17:38.013
- Let me get this straight.

17:38.057 --> 17:40.146
Cooper Davis,
the 23-year-old nephew

17:40.189 --> 17:42.104
of the victim's
deceased husband,

17:42.148 --> 17:43.975
is a DNA match
for her rape kit?

17:44.019 --> 17:45.803
- The short answer is yes.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.109
- The long answer?

17:47.153 --> 17:49.242
- Not much longer.
- I'm listening.

17:49.285 --> 17:50.808
- He's a sperm donor.

17:50.852 --> 17:52.462
We checked with the bank.

17:52.506 --> 17:55.161
Profile's been requested a
dozen times in the last month.

17:55.204 --> 17:57.119
- But because of HIPAA laws,
confidentiality,

17:57.163 --> 17:58.686
they're not gonna
give you those names.

17:58.729 --> 18:01.776
- Right, but this is a specific
kind of sexual assault.

18:01.819 --> 18:02.951
Can you get a court order?

18:02.994 --> 18:04.474
- I can try
to get a court order,

18:04.518 --> 18:06.824
but confidentiality
around reproductive rights

18:06.868 --> 18:08.261
is pretty tight.

18:08.304 --> 18:10.176
- All right, well,
in the meantime,

18:10.219 --> 18:12.656
we go back to Zoe.

18:12.700 --> 18:14.658
- And ask her what?

18:14.702 --> 18:18.967
- Maybe she knows somebody
who wanted to get her pregnant.

18:19.010 --> 18:22.623
- So the semen on the rape kit
matched to Cooper,

18:22.666 --> 18:24.103
but it wasn't him?

18:24.146 --> 18:27.106
- It looks like
he has an alibi.

18:27.149 --> 18:33.286
So Zoe, I, uh, have to ask you
a sort of delicate question.

18:33.329 --> 18:34.678
- It can't be any worse
than anything else

18:34.722 --> 18:36.202
I've answered here.

18:36.245 --> 18:39.161
- You said that
Klaus penetrated you,

18:39.205 --> 18:41.816
and I wanted to know
if you could

18:41.859 --> 18:44.384
describe that a little more.

18:44.427 --> 18:47.430
What did it feel like?

18:47.474 --> 18:50.694
- To be with a man
after two years,

18:50.738 --> 18:53.175
it was fun,

18:53.219 --> 18:55.873
till it wasn't.

18:55.917 --> 19:01.401
I felt his penis
go inside of me.

19:01.444 --> 19:03.881
But like I said,
it was pretty micro,

19:03.925 --> 19:05.405
and now I'm just confused.

19:05.448 --> 19:07.581
It all happened very fast.

19:07.624 --> 19:10.366
- Right.

19:10.410 --> 19:13.761
- The nurse gave me
a morning after pill.

19:13.804 --> 19:15.545
I hadn't thought
about taking it, but--

19:15.589 --> 19:19.070
- Well, that's your decision.

19:19.114 --> 19:21.682
[pensive music]

19:21.725 --> 19:24.989
- Klaus was always so
respectful of my boundaries.

19:25.033 --> 19:28.428
He was a gentle dom.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.388
I thought we were having
so much fun.

19:32.432 --> 19:34.390
Why would Klaus
do something like that?

19:36.131 --> 19:37.872
- I don't know.

19:37.915 --> 19:41.484
But what I do know is that

19:41.528 --> 19:45.575
some guys
have a pregnancy fetish.

19:45.619 --> 19:49.231
It's the ultimate exertion
of power.

19:49.275 --> 19:50.798
[phone chimes]

19:53.192 --> 19:54.845
- Oh, my God.
- What?

19:54.889 --> 19:56.847
- It's--it's him. It's Klaus.

19:56.891 --> 19:58.458
- What did he say?

19:58.501 --> 20:00.155
- "I never meant to hurt you.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.548
"I'm going out of the country,

20:01.591 --> 20:04.942
and I wanna see you
one last time."

20:04.986 --> 20:07.206
What--what should I do?

20:11.297 --> 20:12.472
[phone chimes]

20:12.515 --> 20:15.257
"My little A student,
shut the lights

20:15.301 --> 20:17.346
then stand by the window."

20:17.390 --> 20:19.783
The instructions
are almost exactly the same.

20:19.827 --> 20:20.828
- All right, Zoe.

20:20.871 --> 20:23.004
You just get him
in the room, okay?

20:23.047 --> 20:25.615
- We'll do the rest.

20:25.659 --> 20:27.313
- They say light's
the best sanitizer.
