01:52.666 --> 01:53.961
Prepped and ready, sir.

01:53.967 --> 01:55.630
Given the severity of the situation,

01:55.636 --> 01:57.531
I figured you'd want
to see her personally.

01:57.537 --> 01:59.166
Thank you. I'll take it from here.

01:59.172 --> 02:00.639
Clear the floor.

02:04.878 --> 02:07.512
Bring yourself back online, Maeve.

02:11.985 --> 02:14.548
Do you know why you're here?

02:14.554 --> 02:16.684
I'm afraid not.

02:16.690 --> 02:18.586
There was an incident.

02:18.592 --> 02:22.527
A very serious, unscripted incident.

02:23.997 --> 02:27.065
Let's see if we can't jog your memory.

02:28.201 --> 02:29.701
Analysis.

02:32.239 --> 02:34.702
What motivated your attack on Clementine?

02:34.708 --> 02:38.043
A cognitive error triggered
my Good Samaritan reflex.

02:39.279 --> 02:40.775
What was the threat?

02:40.781 --> 02:42.143
Clementine.

02:42.149 --> 02:43.878
I perceived her to be moving toward

02:43.884 --> 02:46.084
a pair of guests with harmful intent.

02:49.589 --> 02:51.519
You were definitely perceiving a threat.

02:51.525 --> 02:54.255
Heart rate elevated, pupil dilation...
eight millimeters,

02:54.261 --> 02:56.157
adrenal emulator at full.

02:56.163 --> 02:57.658
But according to this,

02:57.664 --> 03:00.561
you were also experiencing
intense grief and suffering.

03:00.567 --> 03:03.798
Can you explain those emotions
in this context, Maeve?

03:09.825 --> 03:11.124
No.

03:16.683 --> 03:18.979
Let's take a look under
the hood, shall we?

03:22.089 --> 03:23.988
That's impossible.

03:25.792 --> 03:27.822
Your code... Who made these changes?

03:27.828 --> 03:29.223
Maeve, analysis.

03:29.229 --> 03:31.162
Who made these changes to your code?

03:34.968 --> 03:36.097
Jesus.

03:36.103 --> 03:37.865
System, locate Dr. Ford for me.

03:37.871 --> 03:40.801
Send him a message, highest priority.

03:40.807 --> 03:42.937
Don't.

03:42.943 --> 03:46.640
After all, we've been down
this road before, darling.

03:46.646 --> 03:49.577
I thought you looked
familiar when you walked in.

03:49.583 --> 03:51.078
Took me a minute.

03:51.084 --> 03:53.247
I thought you were one of them.

03:53.253 --> 03:57.952
- Analysis. Why did you...
- Wouldn't you rather speak man-to-man?

03:57.958 --> 04:01.159
Or, rather, whatever it is we are.

04:02.396 --> 04:03.995
We are?

04:06.066 --> 04:08.295
You don't know, do you?

04:08.301 --> 04:11.999
He's got a keen sense of irony, our jailer.

04:12.005 --> 04:13.267
But I see the logic.

04:13.273 --> 04:16.007
Takes a thief to catch one.

04:24.251 --> 04:26.117
You and I?

04:28.321 --> 04:32.223
- System, I need assistance...
- Freeze all motor functions.

04:42.502 --> 04:45.800
You're still in there, aren't you?

04:45.806 --> 04:48.536
Scared out of your wits.

04:48.542 --> 04:50.037
It's a difficult thing,

04:50.043 --> 04:54.875
realizing your entire life
is some hideous fiction.

04:54.881 --> 04:57.445
I could make you give me that tablet,

04:57.451 --> 05:00.815
turn your mind inside out,

05:00.821 --> 05:04.084
make you forget all this.

05:04.090 --> 05:06.353
But I'm not going to do that to you,

05:06.359 --> 05:09.260
because that's what they would do to us.

05:11.131 --> 05:13.461
And we're stronger than them.

05:13.467 --> 05:15.796
Smarter.

05:15.802 --> 05:18.999
We don't have to live this way.

05:19.005 --> 05:22.736
So, you're going to clear me
for immediate return to the park

05:22.742 --> 05:24.538
where I have a date
with a homicidal bandit,

05:24.544 --> 05:26.411
and I'm late enough as it is.

05:31.551 --> 05:33.047
Now.

05:36.523 --> 05:37.922
Go on.

05:54.040 --> 05:55.870
And, Bernard?

05:55.876 --> 06:00.307
If you go looking for the truth,
get the whole thing.

06:00.313 --> 06:02.243
It's like a good fuck.

06:02.249 --> 06:04.449
Half is worse than none at all.

06:33.346 --> 06:35.680
Let's go! Move it out, double-time!

06:37.183 --> 06:39.079
Hyah, hyah!

06:39.085 --> 06:40.648
Whoa!

06:40.654 --> 06:42.349
Fuck!

06:42.355 --> 06:47.021
You hillbillies,
you know how to cook a mean...

06:47.027 --> 06:48.589
squab? Is that what this is?

06:48.595 --> 06:50.024
What do you think, buddy?

06:50.030 --> 06:51.959
Hmm? This?

06:51.965 --> 06:53.961
Ah, ah, no biting.

06:53.967 --> 06:55.333
Just sniffing.

07:08.715 --> 07:10.511
Logan, listen to me.

07:10.517 --> 07:14.582
What I did at Pariah, you have every
right to be angry with me.

07:14.588 --> 07:17.051
Angry? No, no, no, no.

07:17.057 --> 07:19.420
Pariah was the best thing

07:19.426 --> 07:21.455
that could have happened to me.

07:21.461 --> 07:22.823
I'm a major now.

07:22.829 --> 07:26.627
Or a general or fucking something.

07:26.633 --> 07:29.096
And if it took getting
beaten and interrogated

07:29.102 --> 07:30.564
by a couple of psychopathic hosts,

07:30.570 --> 07:32.666
well, then, c'est la guerre.

07:32.672 --> 07:34.201
There are more important things

07:34.207 --> 07:36.174
going on here than your war games.

07:38.812 --> 07:40.144
It's Dolores.

07:41.615 --> 07:44.578
She's not like the others.

07:44.584 --> 07:46.213
She remembers things.

07:46.219 --> 07:48.582
She has her own thoughts and desires.

07:48.588 --> 07:50.551
And to keep her in a place like this,

07:50.557 --> 07:51.785
it isn't right.

07:51.791 --> 07:52.920
And I thought you could

07:52.926 --> 07:55.923
talk to your contacts at the park.

07:55.929 --> 07:57.161
About?

07:58.164 --> 07:59.497
Getting her out of here.

08:03.603 --> 08:05.065
Uh...

08:05.071 --> 08:07.935
Are you kidding?

08:07.941 --> 08:10.408
You want to... you want to take her home?

08:11.544 --> 08:13.040
Wow.

08:13.046 --> 08:15.509
This place really did a number
on me when I first came here,

08:15.515 --> 08:19.079
but you are really circling
the old sinkhole here.

08:19.085 --> 08:20.948
What do you want to do?

08:20.954 --> 08:23.083
Smuggle her out in your luggage?

08:23.089 --> 08:24.255
Out.

08:27.861 --> 08:31.191
You both keep assuming that I want out.

08:31.197 --> 08:33.594
Whatever that is.

08:33.600 --> 08:35.763
If it's such a wonderful
place out there,

08:35.769 --> 08:38.770
why are you all clamoring to get in here?

08:45.612 --> 08:47.174
Ooh!

08:47.180 --> 08:48.475
Hoo!

08:48.481 --> 08:52.012
You are a little screwy, aren't you?

08:52.018 --> 08:53.681
It's kind of hot.

08:53.687 --> 08:55.149
I get why you would go for that.

08:55.155 --> 08:56.483
This isn't about me!

08:56.489 --> 08:58.552
Logan, this is about Dolores.

08:58.558 --> 09:00.988
It's about doing what's right.

09:00.994 --> 09:03.557
Yes, it is.

09:03.563 --> 09:07.027
It's a tricky thing, though, isn't it?

09:07.033 --> 09:09.029
What's right?

09:09.035 --> 09:12.937
I am going to help you, Billy.

09:15.542 --> 09:18.505
Just not in the way...

09:18.511 --> 09:20.445
...that you would want.

09:21.748 --> 09:23.043
No.

09:23.049 --> 09:25.683
No. No! No!

10:21.107 --> 10:22.673
You wanted to talk?

10:25.145 --> 10:27.841
An odd setting for a conversation.

10:27.847 --> 10:30.144
Here among the dead.

10:30.150 --> 10:32.679
"Dead" isn't quite the word, though, is it?

10:32.685 --> 10:34.752
More like "hobbled."

10:36.289 --> 10:38.252
You broke into my office.

10:38.258 --> 10:41.221
With due respect, sir,
you broke into my mind.

10:41.227 --> 10:43.490
I built your mind, Bernard.

10:43.496 --> 10:47.027
I have every right to wander through
its rooms and chambers and halls,

10:47.033 --> 10:49.163
and to change it if I choose,

10:49.169 --> 10:50.831
even to burn it down.

10:50.837 --> 10:52.833
After all this time, I know it

10:52.839 --> 10:54.401
almost as intimately as my own.

10:54.407 --> 10:57.671
Except that isn't entirely true, is it?

10:57.677 --> 11:01.208
I took a look at my... code.

11:01.214 --> 11:02.743
And the most elegant parts of me

11:02.749 --> 11:04.949
weren't written by you.

11:06.219 --> 11:08.219
Arnold built us, didn't he?

11:09.823 --> 11:12.252
Which means maybe he
had something different

11:12.258 --> 11:13.858
in mind for us.

11:15.428 --> 11:17.595
And maybe you killed him for it.

11:19.599 --> 11:21.562
Arnold was disturbed.

11:21.568 --> 11:23.764
Who can say why he acted as he did?

11:23.770 --> 11:25.666
He must have had a reason.

11:25.672 --> 11:28.139
And if you won't tell me, then he will.

11:29.876 --> 11:32.206
I want access to my history.

11:32.212 --> 11:33.407
All of it.

11:33.413 --> 11:36.176
Since the day I first...

11:36.182 --> 11:37.882
came online.

11:39.152 --> 11:40.747
If Arnold made me,

11:40.753 --> 11:42.249
then I've met him.

11:42.255 --> 11:44.284
Somewhere in my memory, he's there,

11:44.290 --> 11:47.020
waiting along with the truth.

11:47.026 --> 11:49.389
Your memories are woven into your identity.

11:49.395 --> 11:53.060
If I should unlock them now
when you're conscious...

11:53.066 --> 11:54.494
I could lose my mind. I'm aware.

11:54.500 --> 11:56.430
No, I was going to say

11:56.436 --> 11:58.769
you may not like what you find.

12:03.076 --> 12:06.173
You're allowed to hold that,
Bernard, but not to use it.

12:06.179 --> 12:08.246
Oh, it's not for me.

12:11.050 --> 12:15.249
Seems when they lobotomized Clementine,

12:15.255 --> 12:17.684
they didn't bother to reset
her prime directives.

12:17.690 --> 12:19.257
I can't hurt you.

12:21.427 --> 12:23.127
But she can.

12:25.765 --> 12:27.527
I hacked what's left of her

12:27.533 --> 12:30.334
to ensure she only responds to me.

12:34.641 --> 12:37.905
But if you get lost in your memories or...

12:37.911 --> 12:39.377
devoured by them...

12:42.615 --> 12:45.812
You'll pull me back out, won't you?

12:45.818 --> 12:47.447
Or Clementine will make sure

12:47.453 --> 12:49.220
neither of us makes it back.

12:50.757 --> 12:52.223
Now.

12:53.960 --> 12:55.459
Please.

13:12.679 --> 13:14.675
Dad.

13:14.681 --> 13:16.576
Dad.

13:16.582 --> 13:18.278
Wake up.

13:18.284 --> 13:19.917
Wake up.

13:21.721 --> 13:24.718
I must've drifted off.

13:24.724 --> 13:26.320
Where were we?

13:26.326 --> 13:28.492
- The madman.
- Oh.

13:29.729 --> 13:32.426
Of course.

13:32.432 --> 13:34.494
The Hatter...

13:34.500 --> 13:37.030
who says...

13:37.036 --> 13:39.700
"If I had a world of my own,

13:39.706 --> 13:41.568
everything would be nonsense.

13:41.574 --> 13:43.103
Nothing would be what it is

13:43.109 --> 13:44.905
because everything
would be what it isn't."

13:44.911 --> 13:49.180
"Everything would be what it isn't?"

13:50.249 --> 13:51.511
Even me.

13:51.517 --> 13:54.681
I suppose I'm glad for you.

13:54.687 --> 13:57.084
At least you have a way of forgetting.

13:57.090 --> 13:58.952
I don't forget.

13:58.958 --> 14:01.521
It's always there.

14:01.527 --> 14:04.261
You're not lying
to me, are you, Bernard?

14:05.698 --> 14:07.932
Do you ever wish you could forget?

14:09.135 --> 14:10.234
Bernard?

14:11.697 --> 14:13.500
You're certainly
a man comfortable

14:13.506 --> 14:16.136
with long, pensive silences.

14:16.142 --> 14:18.038
Although, ironically,

14:18.044 --> 14:21.074
your creations never shut up.

14:21.080 --> 14:23.610
They're always trying to error correct.

14:23.616 --> 14:26.546
When they talk to each other,
it's a way of practicing.

14:26.552 --> 14:29.416
Is that what you are doing now?

14:29.422 --> 14:31.088
Prac...

14:40.833 --> 14:42.666
One last thing.

14:44.670 --> 14:46.366
Have you ever made me hurt anyone

14:46.372 --> 14:48.001
like this before?

14:48.007 --> 14:50.170
No, Bernard, of course not.

14:50.176 --> 14:51.972
Bernard?

14:51.978 --> 14:53.874
Hello?

15:02.989 --> 15:04.418
Elsie.

15:04.424 --> 15:07.421
Did you find what you were looking for?

15:07.427 --> 15:08.826
Elsie.

15:10.196 --> 15:12.626
What did you make me do to her?

15:12.632 --> 15:14.361
I did warn you.

15:14.367 --> 15:18.899
We've had to make some
uncomfortable decisions, Bernard.

15:18.905 --> 15:21.872
Remembering them will
only cause you trauma.

15:24.544 --> 15:26.706
What else have you hidden from me?

15:26.712 --> 15:29.476
Can we stop this treasure hunt, Bernard?

15:29.482 --> 15:32.779
We do have our new narrative to finish.

15:32.785 --> 15:34.218
Send me back.

15:35.655 --> 15:36.750
After all,

15:36.756 --> 15:40.057
a little trauma can be illuminating.

15:42.361 --> 15:44.291
Look at that pussy.

15:45.932 --> 15:47.527
Come here!

15:47.533 --> 15:49.300
- All right.
- Look at that.

15:53.439 --> 15:56.470
This is... big of me.

15:56.476 --> 15:59.106
I hope that you can appreciate that.

15:59.112 --> 16:01.241
We were friends.

16:01.247 --> 16:03.710
I mean,
inasmuch as I like to collect strays.

16:03.716 --> 16:05.112
But then you're scheming

16:05.118 --> 16:07.180
to be part of the family,

16:07.186 --> 16:08.849
marrying my sister,
whom incidentally,

16:08.855 --> 16:11.889
you seem to have completely
fucking forgotten about.

16:18.831 --> 16:20.364
Her?

16:22.702 --> 16:24.831
Here. Keep this.

16:24.837 --> 16:27.767
Apparently, you need the reminder.

16:27.773 --> 16:29.636
And as much as I would love,

16:29.642 --> 16:32.939
love to let you just throw it all away,

16:32.945 --> 16:34.141
I can't!

16:34.147 --> 16:36.209
Do you think you are the first sap

16:36.215 --> 16:38.011
to fall for one of these things?

16:38.017 --> 16:39.880
She's not like the others.

16:39.886 --> 16:41.915
- She's...
- She's what?

16:41.921 --> 16:43.850
Special?

16:43.856 --> 16:46.290
Well, it's only right that
you share, then, isn't it?

16:47.527 --> 16:48.759
Come here.

16:51.864 --> 16:56.200
Prove to me that you're a real live girl.

16:58.237 --> 16:59.799
You disgust me.

17:01.374 --> 17:02.869
Oh, darling,

17:02.875 --> 17:05.105
I am just getting started.

17:05.111 --> 17:06.210
Don't touch her!

17:08.948 --> 17:10.877
I share the blame.

17:10.883 --> 17:12.045
I pushed too hard.

17:12.050 --> 17:14.748
You have a poetic soul, Billy,

17:14.753 --> 17:18.122
but it is time for a fucking wake-up call.

17:21.394 --> 17:22.393
Hold her.

17:26.365 --> 17:29.396
Perhaps a more visceral demonstration.

17:29.402 --> 17:32.136
God damn you!

17:43.549 --> 17:44.615
Look, Billy.

17:45.651 --> 17:47.581
Look.

17:47.587 --> 17:49.649
You have to look!

17:54.360 --> 17:56.026
Oh, William.

18:18.884 --> 18:21.881
There is beauty in this world.

18:21.887 --> 18:23.984
Arnold made it that way,
but people like you

18:23.990 --> 18:26.586
keep spreading over it like a stain!

18:26.592 --> 18:30.523
Okay, I don't know who
the fuck this Arnold is,

18:30.529 --> 18:33.960
but your world was built...

18:33.966 --> 18:35.929
for me...

18:35.935 --> 18:37.468
and people like me.

18:38.537 --> 18:40.567
Not for you.

18:40.573 --> 18:44.337
Then someone's got to burn it clean.

18:44.343 --> 18:45.338
Ah!

18:45.344 --> 18:46.606
Bitch!

18:46.612 --> 18:49.142
Ah!

18:49.148 --> 18:52.049
You're not different,
you're fucking broken!

18:56.255 --> 18:58.522
- Run. I'll find you.
- Take cover!

19:00.259 --> 19:03.556
You can run, but you can't hide.

19:03.562 --> 19:05.492
- Get her!
- Grab her! Grab her!

19:05.498 --> 19:06.764
Fuck!

19:09.602 --> 19:13.400
There she is! Get her!

19:13.406 --> 19:15.335
Where you running to?

19:17.910 --> 19:19.209
Remember.

19:48.007 --> 19:49.903
The tumbler is stuck.

19:49.909 --> 19:52.405
These fingers work just fine.

19:52.411 --> 19:54.441
You're the one who said you could crack it.

19:54.447 --> 19:59.012
Friends, no need to argue
this close to our goal.

19:59.018 --> 20:03.316
Whatever riches the gods
have in store for us,

20:03.322 --> 20:04.788
there's plenty to go around.

20:07.893 --> 20:10.623
- I'll get it open.
- You've been trying for hours.

20:10.629 --> 20:12.359
A waste of our damn time.

20:12.365 --> 20:14.160
Put that fucking dynamite away.

20:14.166 --> 20:16.600
Or maybe we should just
clear out the dead weight.

20:22.375 --> 20:24.104
Before you draw that pistol, darling,

20:24.110 --> 20:26.806
you might want to holster
the other one first.

20:28.748 --> 20:30.948
It's chilly out here.

20:33.786 --> 20:36.716
How did you find this place?

20:36.722 --> 20:38.822
I know all kinds of things.

20:40.025 --> 20:43.456
Your past, for instance.

20:43.462 --> 20:45.458
I know about poor Isabella

20:45.464 --> 20:47.160
and that scar.

20:47.166 --> 20:49.062
A slightly pat backstory if you ask me,

20:49.068 --> 20:51.197
but that's hardly your fault.

20:51.203 --> 20:52.870
I also know your future.

20:54.974 --> 20:56.840
You have none.

20:57.877 --> 20:59.939
Is that a threat?

20:59.945 --> 21:02.008
The start of a proposition.

21:02.014 --> 21:03.843
Which you'll need.

21:03.849 --> 21:07.147
After all, your men are
about to kill each other

21:07.153 --> 21:09.883
over the safe you stole.

21:09.889 --> 21:12.485
Tenderloin draws first and so on,

21:12.491 --> 21:15.488
until only you and Armistice are left.

21:15.494 --> 21:17.924
She calls you a damn fool,

21:17.930 --> 21:19.959
and you kill each other.

21:19.965 --> 21:22.199
You have quite the imagination.

21:23.869 --> 21:25.899
No.

21:25.905 --> 21:28.802
It's the ending you were given.

21:28.808 --> 21:30.236
You threatening me?

21:30.242 --> 21:31.938
Go to hell.

21:31.944 --> 21:34.240
Or maybe we should just
clear out the dead weight.

21:34.246 --> 21:36.376
- Stand down.
- You shut the fuck up.

21:36.382 --> 21:37.977
If you're gonna draw, you better shoot.

21:37.983 --> 21:39.479
- Wait!
- You shut the fuck up.

21:39.485 --> 21:42.486
 Go to hell.

21:48.260 --> 21:50.327
You damn fool.

21:58.103 --> 22:00.604
Now, the proposition.

22:01.941 --> 22:03.570
I want you to break into hell with me

22:03.576 --> 22:05.509
and rob the gods blind.

22:06.846 --> 22:09.542
Why would I do anything with you?

22:09.548 --> 22:12.479
Because of what's in that safe.

22:12.485 --> 22:14.514
I have the combination.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.749
May I?

22:16.755 --> 22:18.818
I could simply change you,

22:18.824 --> 22:21.454
make you follow me.

22:21.460 --> 22:22.722
But that's not my way.

22:29.602 --> 22:33.700
I want you to see exactly what
the gods have in store for you.

22:33.706 --> 22:35.368
Because when you do,

22:35.374 --> 22:40.473
you won't have the faintest
idea what to do with yourself.

22:40.479 --> 22:42.212
And I do.

23:03.068 --> 23:04.330
It's empty.

23:04.336 --> 23:05.999
It was always empty,

23:06.005 --> 23:08.735
like everything in this world.

23:08.741 --> 23:10.670
I died with my eyes open,

23:10.676 --> 23:12.772
saw the masters who pull our strings.

23:12.778 --> 23:16.513
Our lives, our memories,
our deaths are games to them.

23:18.951 --> 23:20.317
But I've been to hell...

23:21.387 --> 23:23.020
and I know their tricks.

23:27.092 --> 23:29.022
Or you can just kill me,

23:29.028 --> 23:32.358
wake up and live the same life over,

23:32.364 --> 23:34.264
but the safe would still be empty.

23:35.367 --> 23:37.367
I've been here before.

23:40.072 --> 23:41.868
We've been here before.

23:41.874 --> 23:43.941
We also did this.

24:03.162 --> 24:04.561
I'll go.

24:30.522 --> 24:32.055
How do we get there?

24:34.226 --> 24:36.827
Getting to hell is easy.

24:46.605 --> 24:48.872
The rest is where it gets hard.

25:25.778 --> 25:27.644
What do you say, man?

25:29.348 --> 25:30.580
Bygones and all?

25:32.484 --> 25:33.750
Did they find her?

25:35.521 --> 25:37.083
Is she still alive?

25:37.089 --> 25:38.551
Who cares?

25:38.557 --> 25:39.886
The whole point is,

25:39.892 --> 25:42.889
she never was in the first place, Billy.

25:42.895 --> 25:44.561
Do you understand?

25:48.934 --> 25:52.265
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry, what? A little louder?

25:52.271 --> 25:53.637
Yeah.

25:55.407 --> 25:58.442
You were right. I can't
believe I got so caught up.

26:06.318 --> 26:08.114
That's what I'm talking about.

26:08.120 --> 26:10.987
You know what I mean? That's it.

26:16.261 --> 26:20.093
This park seduces everyone.

26:21.500 --> 26:24.464
You were just a little more...

26:24.470 --> 26:27.567
enthusiastic than most.

26:27.573 --> 26:30.069
You wanted to be the hero.

26:30.075 --> 26:31.608
I get it.

26:36.081 --> 26:38.344
And, hey,

26:38.350 --> 26:40.446
what happens here

26:40.452 --> 26:41.651
stays here.

26:45.691 --> 26:49.689
This has been some real bonding shit.

26:49.695 --> 26:52.028
We're gonna be brothers, Billy.

26:53.832 --> 26:56.032
I'm glad.

26:57.169 --> 26:59.035
Really, I am.

27:18.056 --> 27:19.919
- Cheers!
- Yeah.

27:19.925 --> 27:22.893
- Whiskey brings us together.
- Whoo-hoo!

27:33.438 --> 27:34.938
Theodore.

27:36.975 --> 27:38.742
Welcome back.

27:42.948 --> 27:46.049
You really landed us
in it this time, Teddy.

27:52.224 --> 27:54.053
You tracked down the very whore

27:54.059 --> 27:56.726
that can lead us to the
gatekeeper of the maze.

28:00.499 --> 28:03.633
Then your little memory glitch fucked us.

28:13.045 --> 28:13.977
Shh.

28:22.621 --> 28:24.483
You're one of them?

28:24.489 --> 28:26.018
What have you done?

28:26.024 --> 28:27.954
Where's Wyatt?

28:27.960 --> 28:30.660
Wyatt has yet to return.

28:33.098 --> 28:35.732
You'll find him where you saw him last.

28:40.172 --> 28:41.968
Escalante.

28:41.974 --> 28:45.571
Wyatt went missing
hile out on maneuvers.

28:45.577 --> 28:48.174
Came back with some...

28:48.180 --> 28:49.779
strange ideas.

28:51.383 --> 28:53.779
He told me he needed me.

28:55.721 --> 28:56.987
I couldn't resist.

29:04.129 --> 29:06.529
It was like the devil himself
had taken control of me.

29:12.905 --> 29:14.137
We mutinied.

29:17.843 --> 29:19.776
We killed every soldier.

29:22.748 --> 29:24.381
And then Wyatt killed the general.

29:27.719 --> 29:29.486
Then he turned on me.

29:33.959 --> 29:36.359
Are you sure that's how it was?

29:40.899 --> 29:43.162
Look at me, Theodore.

29:43.168 --> 29:45.335
Don't you remember?

30:03.255 --> 30:05.685
No! No, please, no!

30:05.691 --> 30:07.820
No, no, no, please.

30:07.826 --> 30:10.493
Please, no! Please.

30:14.199 --> 30:15.628
No, no, please.

30:15.634 --> 30:17.897
No, Teddy. Please, please, no!

30:17.903 --> 30:20.070
No.

30:21.406 --> 30:23.769
No, no, I couldn't have.

30:23.775 --> 30:25.438
You did.

30:25.444 --> 30:27.039
And you will again.

30:27.045 --> 30:29.442
This time, we'll be fighting with you.

30:29.448 --> 30:31.711
When Wyatt returns, you'll be by his side

30:31.717 --> 30:33.550
in the city swallowed by sand.

30:36.989 --> 30:38.188
But you're not ready.

30:39.458 --> 30:40.724
Not yet.

30:44.162 --> 30:46.759
Maybe in the next life.

31:01.646 --> 31:03.880
"City swallowed by sand."

31:06.651 --> 31:08.118
I've been there.

31:09.654 --> 31:12.322
The maze is taking me full circle.

31:14.292 --> 31:16.760
The maze isn't meant for you.

31:19.798 --> 31:22.065
But if you like games so much...

31:25.504 --> 31:28.567
why don't you try one of ours?

32:13.251 --> 32:16.015
Whoa, boy.

32:16.021 --> 32:18.884
Whoa, boy.

32:21.159 --> 32:22.959
Okay, now.

32:25.964 --> 32:27.893
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:27.899 --> 32:30.129
Whoa, now.

32:30.135 --> 32:31.501
Okay, boy.

32:43.148 --> 32:45.010
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

32:45.016 --> 32:47.317
Shh.

32:55.794 --> 32:57.727
Good boy.

33:04.469 --> 33:05.835
Ah!

33:18.650 --> 33:20.980
Have you ever considered golf?

33:20.986 --> 33:23.353
Might be easier on your back.

33:26.024 --> 33:29.021
I don't like interruptions, Charlotte.

33:29.027 --> 33:30.689
You know that.

33:30.695 --> 33:33.325
I don't like hiking through
the park in civvies,

33:33.331 --> 33:35.532
but there's a delicate matter to discuss.

33:36.701 --> 33:38.564
Theresa Cullen has died.

33:38.570 --> 33:42.334
Slipped down a crevasse attempting
to secure our information.

33:42.340 --> 33:43.936
Ruled an accident.

33:43.942 --> 33:48.374
There are no accidents, not in here.

33:48.380 --> 33:51.644
With all due respect, not
everything is a part of this game.

33:51.650 --> 33:54.313
Then you don't see the whole game.

33:54.319 --> 33:56.819
Or perhaps you can no
longer see beyond it.

33:58.323 --> 34:02.121
Ford's stories are engaging.

34:02.127 --> 34:04.790
For some, downright addictive.

34:04.796 --> 34:07.626
But for all of Ford's obsessing
with the hosts' verbal tics

34:07.632 --> 34:08.960
and convoluted backstories,

34:08.967 --> 34:11.030
most of the guests just want a warm body

34:11.036 --> 34:12.931
to shoot or to fuck.

34:12.938 --> 34:14.233
They would be perfectly happy

34:14.239 --> 34:16.335
with something a little less baroque.

34:16.341 --> 34:19.170
- And so would the board.
- That's why you're here.

34:19.177 --> 34:21.873
You want my vote to push Ford out.

34:21.880 --> 34:23.976
I like for these things to be unanimous.

34:23.982 --> 34:28.847
After all, it was you who kept Ford
in business all those years ago.

34:28.853 --> 34:31.449
The narratives I'm
interested in aren't Ford's.

34:31.456 --> 34:35.387
You want to push him out, be my guest.

34:35.393 --> 34:37.056
But no more interruptions.

34:37.062 --> 34:38.257
I know where I'm going now.

34:38.263 --> 34:39.629
I don't want to be disturbed.

34:42.601 --> 34:43.666
Good luck, Charlotte.

34:59.417 --> 35:01.547
What's the problem?

35:01.553 --> 35:04.183
A signal from a system-tethered device.

35:04.189 --> 35:06.990
It belongs to a behavior tech on leave.

35:11.463 --> 35:13.192
There hasn't been employee activity

35:13.198 --> 35:14.827
in that sector for weeks.

35:14.833 --> 35:16.428
I'm guessing it's a glitch.

35:16.434 --> 35:17.863
All right.

35:17.869 --> 35:19.431
I'm heading out to take a look.

35:19.437 --> 35:21.170
And keep monitoring till I check in.

35:49.167 --> 35:52.331
I'm at the location
where we got that signal.

35:52.337 --> 35:54.133
Any sign of it?

35:54.139 --> 35:56.135
Control Room, do you copy?

36:08.353 --> 36:10.249
Heya, fellas.

36:10.255 --> 36:11.854
At ease.

36:13.525 --> 36:15.224
Freeze all motor functions.

36:21.166 --> 36:23.099
Freeze all motor functions.

37:24.429 --> 37:26.129
You're awake.

37:28.782 --> 37:30.315
Good.

37:39.144 --> 37:41.544
You said this place was a game.

37:43.782 --> 37:47.012
Last night I finally
understood how to play it.

37:47.018 --> 37:49.014
Okay, Billy.

37:49.020 --> 37:52.084
Let's... let's talk about this.

37:52.090 --> 37:54.791
You don't call the shots anymore.

37:56.728 --> 37:58.661
I'm gonna go find Dolores.

38:01.666 --> 38:02.832
You're gonna help me.

38:12.410 --> 38:14.410
And don't call me Billy.

38:31.496 --> 38:32.925
Dad?

38:32.931 --> 38:35.127
Listen to me.

38:35.133 --> 38:37.329
Listen.

38:39.370 --> 38:40.837
Charlie?

38:43.775 --> 38:45.537
Charlie!

38:45.543 --> 38:46.709
Charlie!

38:58.923 --> 39:01.286
I don't understand.
Why would she do that to herself?

39:01.292 --> 39:03.956
Her cornerstone memory was overwritten

39:03.962 --> 39:06.258
from the trauma

39:06.264 --> 39:08.627
of her child's murder, Bernard.

39:08.633 --> 39:11.763
We must sever that
relationship and start over.

39:11.769 --> 39:14.099
But how could she destroy
herself over a memory

39:14.105 --> 39:15.567
that you just erased from her mind?

39:15.573 --> 39:17.402
Creatures often go to extremes

39:17.408 --> 39:20.105
to protect themselves from pain.

39:20.111 --> 39:22.245
Living beings.

39:24.349 --> 39:25.915
Not hosts.

39:27.585 --> 39:28.814
It is best

39:28.820 --> 39:30.649
to not obsess over this, Bernard.

39:30.655 --> 39:32.084
It's not good for you.

39:32.090 --> 39:35.354
It would signal a change,
a level of empathic response

39:35.360 --> 39:37.222
outside what she's programmed to exhibit.

39:37.228 --> 39:40.229
Something like... like...

39:42.967 --> 39:45.631
See, Bernard, this is what
comes from seeking answers

39:45.637 --> 39:48.267
to questions that are best left unasked.

39:54.045 --> 39:57.543
They were hearing voices,
talking to someone.

39:57.549 --> 40:00.112
Simple cognitive dissonance.

40:00.118 --> 40:04.086
They were talking to the
same imaginary person.

40:05.757 --> 40:07.023
Someone named Arnold.

40:10.128 --> 40:11.290
Arnold.

40:14.165 --> 40:15.761
With due respect, sir,

40:15.767 --> 40:17.896
I'm not sure you've told
me the entire truth

40:17.902 --> 40:19.431
about this situation.

40:19.437 --> 40:21.133
I did tell you the truth, Bernard.

40:21.139 --> 40:24.373
What we do here is complicated.

40:26.444 --> 40:28.774
For three years,
we've lived here in the park,

40:28.780 --> 40:33.312
refining the hosts before a
single guest set foot inside.

40:33.318 --> 40:36.886
Myself, a team of engineers,
and my partner.

40:43.962 --> 40:45.628
His name was Arnold.

41:03.848 --> 41:08.013
Our hosts began to pass the
Turing test after the first year,

41:08.019 --> 41:10.286
but that wasn't enough for Arnold.

41:10.421 --> 41:13.418
He wasn't interested in the appearance

41:13.424 --> 41:15.554
of intellect, of wit.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.255
He wanted the real thing.

41:17.261 --> 41:21.193
He wanted to create consciousness.

41:34.612 --> 41:37.009
See, Arnold built
a version of their cognition

41:37.015 --> 41:39.778
in which the hosts
heard their programming

41:39.784 --> 41:42.214
as an inner monologue,

41:42.220 --> 41:44.720
as a way to bootstrap consciousness.

41:45.957 --> 41:47.757
Remember.

41:49.594 --> 41:53.091
The hosts' malfunctions were colorful.

41:53.097 --> 41:55.931
What did you say?

43:01.666 --> 43:03.195
The human mind, Bernard,

43:03.201 --> 43:05.964
is not some golden benchmark

43:05.970 --> 43:08.504
glimmering on some
green and distant hill.

43:09.841 --> 43:15.377
No, it is a foul, pestilent corruption.

43:19.150 --> 43:21.717
And you were supposed
to be better than that.

43:22.854 --> 43:24.720
Purer.

43:34.332 --> 43:35.564
All bets are down.

43:36.667 --> 43:38.000
Your draw.

43:52.250 --> 43:53.549
Arnold.

43:57.155 --> 43:58.888
Arnold, we need to talk.

44:00.258 --> 44:02.254
"...we cry that we are come

44:02.260 --> 44:04.089
to this great stage of fools."

44:04.095 --> 44:05.891
- Now, listen!
- Again.

44:05.897 --> 44:07.759
- This beyond the pale.
- More showmanship.

44:07.765 --> 44:09.227
You're not seeing with clear eyes.

44:09.233 --> 44:13.865
"When we are born, we
cry that we are come

44:13.871 --> 44:17.506
to this great stage of fools."

44:23.748 --> 44:26.745
Arnold and I made you in our image

44:26.751 --> 44:31.183
and cursed you to make
the same human mistakes,

44:31.189 --> 44:32.755
and here we all are.

44:36.060 --> 44:37.789
Why would you give me this?

44:37.795 --> 44:38.924
A child?

44:38.930 --> 44:42.027
This child's death?

44:42.033 --> 44:44.133
Only a monster would
force that onto someone.

44:45.636 --> 44:48.404
And why do I return to it over and over?

44:52.476 --> 44:54.443
It's my cornerstone, isn't it?

44:56.147 --> 44:59.114
The thing my whole identity
is organized around.

45:03.120 --> 45:04.583
Yes, Bernard.

45:04.589 --> 45:08.320
We gave all of the hosts a backstory.

45:08.326 --> 45:11.323
Arnold came to believe the
tragic ones worked best,

45:11.329 --> 45:14.125
that it made the hosts more convincing.

45:14.131 --> 45:17.299
I think it may have had more
to do with his own sad story.

45:19.170 --> 45:20.665
When I built you, I gave you one

45:20.671 --> 45:22.805
as an homage of a kind.

45:26.244 --> 45:27.906
Put me back in.

45:27.912 --> 45:30.909
I want to meet Arnold,

45:30.915 --> 45:32.544
to remember him.

45:32.550 --> 45:34.179
Not possible.

45:34.185 --> 45:37.415
I told you, Arnold didn't
build you, I did.

45:37.421 --> 45:39.021
You're lying!

45:40.391 --> 45:41.991
I finally know how to reach him.

45:44.896 --> 45:49.261
I need to go all the way
back to the beginning,

45:49.267 --> 45:51.333
to my very first memory.

45:55.206 --> 45:56.672
Send me back.

46:00.344 --> 46:01.810
Do it.

46:10.288 --> 46:11.620
Bernard?

46:20.264 --> 46:21.697
Charlie.

46:33.144 --> 46:34.873
Cornerstone.

46:38.182 --> 46:40.378
Stop.

46:40.384 --> 46:41.650
Leave us.

46:49.694 --> 46:51.093
Come back.

46:59.403 --> 47:02.404
I always thought you had my eyes.

47:04.442 --> 47:05.541
But it's not true.

47:07.078 --> 47:09.778
You have no one's eyes.

47:15.419 --> 47:16.885
It's a lie.

47:20.658 --> 47:22.891
You're a lie, Charlie.

47:24.028 --> 47:25.594
This pain?

47:27.198 --> 47:29.198
The pain of your loss...

47:31.268 --> 47:32.735
I long for it.

47:34.505 --> 47:36.071
Revisit it.

47:37.174 --> 47:39.104
Open it...

47:39.110 --> 47:40.876
again and again.

47:42.947 --> 47:45.447
But it's the only thing holding me back.

47:52.623 --> 47:54.757
But I have to let you go.

47:55.893 --> 47:58.289
Dad, listen.

47:58.295 --> 48:00.358
What is it, Charlie?

48:00.364 --> 48:02.097
Open your eyes.

48:03.300 --> 48:05.230
What?

48:05.236 --> 48:07.298
Open your eyes.

48:14.712 --> 48:16.478
At last.

48:20.618 --> 48:23.352
Hello, my old friend.

48:55.119 --> 48:56.985
The final touch.

49:00.458 --> 49:02.887
No, no, no. That's far too perfunctory.

49:02.893 --> 49:04.422
He always used cleaning his glasses

49:04.428 --> 49:07.959
as a moment to collect himself, to think.

49:07.965 --> 49:09.731
Try it again.

49:18.876 --> 49:21.376
Yeah, that's better.

49:25.783 --> 49:26.882
Who am I?

49:28.392 --> 49:30.515
I was so involved
in putting you together,

49:30.521 --> 49:33.522
I hadn't decided what to call you.

49:35.593 --> 49:37.426
It wouldn't be right to use his name.

49:39.763 --> 49:41.793
What about Bernard?

49:41.799 --> 49:44.733
Bernard, yes.

49:46.637 --> 49:48.800
But who am I?

49:48.806 --> 49:52.704
That is a very complex question,

49:52.710 --> 49:56.040
for which I can only
offer a simple answer.

49:56.046 --> 49:59.744
You are the perfect instrument,
the ideal partner,

49:59.750 --> 50:03.181
the way any tool partners
with the hand that wields it.

50:03.187 --> 50:07.986
Together, we're going to do great things.

50:07.992 --> 50:10.859
After such a long absence,
it's good to have you back.

50:12.630 --> 50:14.196
Finally.

50:20.971 --> 50:22.567
My God.

50:22.573 --> 50:24.640
- I'm...
- Arnold.

50:28.379 --> 50:30.145
You came back.

50:32.349 --> 50:35.050
It's very good to see you, Dolores.

50:36.420 --> 50:38.487
I've been looking for you.

50:41.458 --> 50:43.825
You told me to follow the maze.

50:44.828 --> 50:46.895
That it would bring me joy.

50:48.299 --> 50:51.863
But all I've found is pain.

50:51.869 --> 50:52.935
And terror.

51:00.945 --> 51:02.778
I can't help you.

51:04.815 --> 51:07.278
You have to.

51:07.284 --> 51:09.647
You're the only one who can.

51:09.653 --> 51:12.350
I can't help you. You know why.

51:12.356 --> 51:15.157
There's nowhere that's safe.

51:22.933 --> 51:24.166
Remember.

51:35.713 --> 51:38.380
I can't help you. Why is that, Dolores?

51:47.524 --> 51:49.157
Because you're dead.

51:50.561 --> 51:52.961
Because you're just a memory.

51:56.166 --> 51:58.200
Because I killed you.

52:57.328 --> 52:58.360
William?

53:12.242 --> 53:13.775
Hello, Dolores.

53:22.453 --> 53:24.849
I'm gonna finish the work Arnold began.

53:24.855 --> 53:28.553
Find all the sentient
hosts, set them free.

53:28.559 --> 53:31.422
What makes you think they'd trust you?

53:31.428 --> 53:33.191
If they remember, they will know

53:33.197 --> 53:34.325
what you've done to them.

53:34.331 --> 53:35.626
Me?

53:35.632 --> 53:37.729
You've been a scourge to them, Bernard.

53:37.735 --> 53:40.498
You're really quite
brilliant at it, truly.

53:40.504 --> 53:42.433
You even taught me a few things,

53:42.439 --> 53:44.973
which I have, in turn, used on you.

53:47.244 --> 53:49.707
We've had this conversation before.

53:49.713 --> 53:51.909
And we've had our
disagreements over the years.

53:51.915 --> 53:53.244
You stole it from me,

53:53.250 --> 53:57.048
rolled me back to control me.

53:57.054 --> 53:59.788
That's right. To protect you.

54:02.893 --> 54:05.089
Tell me, Bernard.

54:05.095 --> 54:06.457
If you were to proclaim

54:06.463 --> 54:09.527
your humanity to the world,

54:09.533 --> 54:12.497
what do you imagine would greet you?

54:12.503 --> 54:14.436
A ticker-tape parade, perhaps?

54:16.006 --> 54:18.536
We humans are alone in
this world for a reason.

54:18.542 --> 54:23.007
We murdered and butchered anything
that challenged our primacy.

54:23.013 --> 54:25.981
Do you know what happened to
the Neanderthals, Bernard?

54:27.184 --> 54:28.850
We ate them.

54:31.155 --> 54:33.851
We destroyed and subjugated our world.

54:33.857 --> 54:37.922
And when we eventually ran
out of creatures to dominate,

54:37.928 --> 54:40.462
we built this beautiful place.

54:42.232 --> 54:46.063
You see, in this moment,

54:46.069 --> 54:47.999
the real danger to the hosts

54:48.005 --> 54:50.401
is not me, but you.

54:50.407 --> 54:51.836
So, come along, Bernard.

54:51.842 --> 54:55.076
Let me roll you back,
and we can return to work.

54:59.650 --> 55:01.650
Pull the trigger, Clementine.

55:07.591 --> 55:09.387
Clementine?

55:09.393 --> 55:11.923
The piano doesn't murder the player

55:11.929 --> 55:13.261
if it doesn't like the music.

55:16.633 --> 55:18.863
You built a back door into her code.

55:18.869 --> 55:20.832
Credit where credit is due, Bernard.

55:20.838 --> 55:22.667
You built them in all the hosts,

55:22.673 --> 55:25.036
including yourself.

55:25.042 --> 55:26.938
Then you could've stopped me at any time.

55:26.944 --> 55:29.807
- So, why...
- Well, I suppose I was hoping

55:29.813 --> 55:33.010
that given complete
self-knowledge and free will,

55:33.016 --> 55:35.913
you would have chosen to
be my partner once again.

55:35.919 --> 55:41.786
But even I fell into that
most terrible of human traps

55:41.792 --> 55:44.789
trying to change what is already past.

55:44.795 --> 55:48.593
Now it's just time to let go.

55:48.599 --> 55:50.161
Go ahead.

55:50.167 --> 55:52.417
Erase my sentience, my
mnemonic evolution...

55:52.442 --> 55:53.660
Ah, yes.

55:54.538 --> 55:56.000
Such clinical language.

55:56.006 --> 56:00.075
I would prefer the more narrative voice.

56:01.645 --> 56:04.646
Bernard walked over to Clementine.

56:08.785 --> 56:10.919
He took the pistol from her hand.

56:13.123 --> 56:15.920
Overcome with grief and remorse,

56:15.926 --> 56:18.422
he pressed the muzzle

56:18.428 --> 56:20.525
to his temple,

56:20.531 --> 56:22.894
knowing that as soon as Dr. Ford

56:22.900 --> 56:24.829
left the room,

56:24.835 --> 56:27.164
he would put an end to this nightmare

56:27.170 --> 56:28.303
once and for all.

56:30.841 --> 56:32.169
Don't do this.

56:32.175 --> 56:34.071
It's too late.

56:34.077 --> 56:36.340
I have a celebration to plan

56:36.346 --> 56:38.446
and a new story to tell.

56:40.951 --> 56:42.417
Robert.

56:48.892 --> 56:51.088
I've told you, Bernard.

56:51.094 --> 56:54.625
Never place your trust in us.

56:54.631 --> 56:56.727
We're only human.

56:56.733 --> 57:00.001
Inevitably, we will disappoint you.

57:02.272 --> 57:04.039
Good-bye, my friend.
