WEBVTT

00:06.274 --> 00:07.275
That's me. Jane Quimby.

00:07.308 --> 00:10.044
My life is a little
complicated right now.

00:10.078 --> 00:11.579
I landed
my fashion dream job
working for her,

00:11.612 --> 00:12.580
Gray Chandler Murray.

00:12.613 --> 00:14.348
The only problem,
they think I'm an adult.

00:14.382 --> 00:17.118
Now I am juggling
two secret lives,

00:17.151 --> 00:20.088
one in high school
and one in high fashion.

00:20.121 --> 00:21.021
Previously on
Jane by Design...

00:23.091 --> 00:24.525
Yes! It's perfect.

00:25.826 --> 00:27.061
It's...

00:27.095 --> 00:29.063
I lovYou do?ndia.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.398
That sketch is mine.
And I...

00:30.431 --> 00:31.599
No, it's mine.

00:31.632 --> 00:32.433
It's mine!

00:32.466 --> 00:34.602
Both of you,
stop it this instant!

00:34.635 --> 00:37.205
It feels kinda weird to go
to a party without her.

00:37.238 --> 00:40.074
You'd rather not go
to a party with me,

00:40.108 --> 00:41.309
than go to one
without Jane?

00:41.342 --> 00:43.444
You can dress up
all you want, but
you're still trash, too.

00:43.477 --> 00:45.613
Just get out.

00:45.646 --> 00:48.516
Lu.

00:48.549 --> 00:49.583
Right.

00:55.156 --> 00:57.091
(BANGING ON DOOR)

00:57.125 --> 00:58.826
You're coming with me. Now.

00:58.859 --> 01:00.428
This is my design.

01:00.461 --> 01:01.495
I'm so sorry
I doubted you, Jane.

01:01.529 --> 01:04.432
Still can't believe
India did this.

01:04.465 --> 01:05.333
India, you and I,

01:05.366 --> 01:07.268
it's over.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.378
JANE: We all have baggage,

01:17.411 --> 01:19.280
the stuff we always
carry with us.

01:22.450 --> 01:24.152
But what are
the essentials,

01:24.185 --> 01:28.189
the things we simply
can't live without?

01:28.222 --> 01:29.590
And what are
the things that we'd be
better off leaving behind?

01:32.493 --> 01:34.328
It's hard to know
what's in your own baggage

01:34.362 --> 01:36.297
until you take
a closer look.

01:41.302 --> 01:45.273
* I've my heart where
my head should be

01:45.306 --> 01:48.409
* Light up the rest of me

01:48.442 --> 01:51.312
* 'Cause your dreams,
they won't fall apart

01:51.345 --> 01:53.681
* Through the stops,
the starts

01:53.714 --> 01:56.517
* And life is a work of art

02:04.292 --> 02:05.626
(SCOFFS) Janey,

02:05.659 --> 02:08.196
I thought this whole
weekend camping trip
was only for one night.

02:11.199 --> 02:12.433
It is.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.534
But, you know,
I just want
to be prepared.

02:13.567 --> 02:15.303
This is Nick's and my
first camping trip together

02:15.336 --> 02:18.572
and I want everything
to go perfectly.

02:18.606 --> 02:19.740
I don't want to leave
anything to chance.

02:21.542 --> 02:22.310
Nervous, huh?

02:22.343 --> 02:22.576
No. I...

02:25.346 --> 02:26.480
On a scale of one to 10?

02:29.350 --> 02:31.252
(CHUCKLES)

02:31.285 --> 02:32.453
What if I mess things up?

02:32.486 --> 02:33.921
Aw, you won't.

02:33.954 --> 02:36.190
And, you know,
if you do,

02:36.224 --> 02:38.192
at least you'll
be well-dressed.

02:38.226 --> 02:39.593
I'm just glad
you're gonna be there.

02:39.627 --> 02:42.330
Right. About that.

02:42.496 --> 02:44.632
I might not go.

02:44.665 --> 02:46.467
What? Why?

02:46.500 --> 02:48.602
Because Lulu's going.

02:48.636 --> 02:50.304
And I haven't
talked to her
since Nick's party.

02:50.338 --> 02:52.573
Has she tried to call?

02:52.606 --> 02:54.608
Yeah, she left me like
a bunch of messages.

02:54.642 --> 02:56.344
What did she say?

02:56.377 --> 02:58.212
That she's sorry
about what happened
the other night.

02:58.246 --> 03:01.649
Whatever.
You know, it doesn't
make any difference.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.618
Look, Billy.
I know you're mad at Lulu.

03:04.652 --> 03:07.255
And I agree
she should've left
with you at the party.

03:07.288 --> 03:09.590
But eventually
you're gonna have
to talk to her.

03:09.623 --> 03:12.360
Are you seriously
trying to patch things up
with me and Lulu right now?

03:12.393 --> 03:15.263
(CHUCKLES) No. No.

03:15.296 --> 03:17.231
But I will give the girl
credit for one thing.

03:18.699 --> 03:18.799
She's not giving up.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.375
Can I help you?

03:27.408 --> 03:28.776
Hi, Tommy.
Is Billy home?

03:28.809 --> 03:29.810
No. Who are you?

03:31.779 --> 03:32.413
I'm Lulu.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.582
Okay.

03:34.615 --> 03:35.783
I'm Billy's girlfriend.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.253
Nice.

03:39.287 --> 03:41.021
Did you guys just meet?

03:41.054 --> 03:43.724
No. We've been
dating for a while.

03:43.757 --> 03:45.693
Really? I didn't know
Billy had a girlfriend.

03:47.828 --> 03:48.262
Can you just
tell him I stopped by?

03:49.830 --> 03:50.564
Yeah, sure thing.

03:50.598 --> 03:51.832
Thanks.

03:53.501 --> 03:55.569
Hey.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.706
What was your name again?

04:00.308 --> 04:01.442
Lulu.

04:08.749 --> 04:12.620
What's a funny
opening line
for sex-ed class?

04:12.653 --> 04:15.389
A funny opening line?

04:15.423 --> 04:18.292
Sex-ed classes
are usually so
stuffy and awkward.

04:18.326 --> 04:21.028
I wanna lead
off with a joke.
Make it fun.

04:21.061 --> 04:22.830
Sex-ed classes are
not supposed to be fun.

04:22.863 --> 04:26.567
I suggest you make it
as awkward as possible.
Trust me.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.670
Okay. Okay.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.805
So. Are you excited
about the camping
trip this weekend?

04:31.839 --> 04:34.608
I've decided to opt out
of my chaperoning duties.

04:34.642 --> 04:36.310
You're not going?

04:36.344 --> 04:37.811
Yeah. Camping's
not really my thing.

04:37.845 --> 04:39.580
That's too bad.

04:39.613 --> 04:42.450
Well, I'm just not really
the outdoors type.

04:42.483 --> 04:45.586
Really?
I love camping.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.721
I feel like it's
a chance to just
become one with nature.

04:47.755 --> 04:52.059
Yeah. That doesn't sound
appealing to me at all.

04:52.092 --> 04:53.727
But I hope you have fun.

04:53.761 --> 04:56.630
Hey, Rita!
Think fast.

04:56.664 --> 04:58.599
Are those the right size?

04:58.632 --> 04:59.800
Yep. They're perfect.

04:59.833 --> 05:00.167
Great. Hey, Ben.

05:01.902 --> 05:03.471
Mr. Hunter.

05:03.504 --> 05:05.473
Come on.
You can call me Todd.

05:05.506 --> 05:08.742
Okay. Todd.
What's with the perfectly
sized marshmallows?

05:08.776 --> 05:11.679
Oh, they're for the
s'mores this weekend.
Rita loves s'mores, so...

05:11.712 --> 05:13.381
She does?

05:13.414 --> 05:14.615
I mean, I knew that.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.084
You did?

05:17.117 --> 05:20.488
Yeah. You must've told me
when we were having
drinks the other night.

05:20.854 --> 05:23.391
Okay. Um, listen, Rita,

05:23.424 --> 05:25.125
you save me a seat
at the campfire
next to you, okay?

05:25.158 --> 05:26.794
You bring
the marshmallows.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.397
I'll bring the graham
crackers and chocolate.

05:29.430 --> 05:31.465
And I will bring
the strawberries,

05:31.499 --> 05:33.901
so save a seat for me
next to you, as well.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.770
At the fire.
On the other side.
It's fine.

05:36.804 --> 05:38.539
I'm confused.
I thought you just said

05:38.572 --> 05:40.841
you weren't going
on the camping trip.

05:40.874 --> 05:43.844
I was kidding.
I love camping.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.913
I can't wait.
It's...

05:45.946 --> 05:49.450
It's really, for me,
a chance to become
one with nature.

05:49.483 --> 05:54.121
So, I'm gonna go read up
right now on which plants
I can eat

05:54.154 --> 05:56.924
and which ones
will kill me.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.859
It's going to be
a really good time.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.794
We're gonna have...
We're gonna have
a lot of fun.

06:02.696 --> 06:04.398
(BELL RINGING)

06:07.501 --> 06:09.903
I just don't see
what the big deal is.

06:09.937 --> 06:12.172
The big deal is he didn't
even tell his brother
he has a girlfriend.

06:12.205 --> 06:15.142
So? You didn't
tell your dad that
you have a boyfriend.

06:15.175 --> 06:16.744
That's totally different.

06:16.777 --> 06:18.812
How iIt just is.erent?

06:18.846 --> 06:19.980
If you say so.

06:21.849 --> 06:23.451
He's coming over here,
by the way.

06:23.484 --> 06:25.486
DonWho? Billy?und.

06:25.519 --> 06:26.820
Yeah.
He's getting closer.

06:26.854 --> 06:28.822
Hey! I said
don't turn around.

06:30.658 --> 06:33.527
I'm gonna go
somewhere else. Bye.

06:35.829 --> 06:36.964
Hey.

06:36.997 --> 06:38.632
Hey.

06:38.666 --> 06:41.902
I like the new old look.

06:41.935 --> 06:43.971
Thanks. You know,
I feel like myself again.

06:44.004 --> 06:46.006
I'm glad.
Did you get my messages?

06:47.641 --> 06:50.444
(SIGHS) Yeah.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.613
I'm really sorry
about the party, Billy.

06:52.646 --> 06:55.583
I guess I just panicked.

06:55.616 --> 06:57.451
I didn't know what
I was supposed to do.

06:57.485 --> 06:58.652
You were supposed
to stand by me.

06:59.553 --> 07:00.621
I know.

07:00.654 --> 07:02.723
I thought you were
on my side, Lulu.

07:02.756 --> 07:04.725
I am on your side, Billy.

07:06.660 --> 07:08.796
Just give me
another chance
and I'll prove it.

07:11.031 --> 07:13.000
Look.

07:13.033 --> 07:15.869
How about we put
all this behind us for now

07:15.903 --> 07:18.606
and try and have
some fun this weekend?

07:18.639 --> 07:19.840
Can we do that?

07:19.873 --> 07:20.508
(BELL RINGING)

07:23.911 --> 07:26.514
Will you be my buddy?

07:26.547 --> 07:27.948
Your buddy?

07:27.981 --> 07:30.651
Yes. I would like
for us to be buddies.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.820
Are you sure
we're ready for that?

07:32.853 --> 07:34.622
I know it's a big step.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.557
The rules of
the camping trip

07:36.590 --> 07:37.558
require each student
to have a buddy this weekend.

07:37.591 --> 07:39.493
AndYes, I do.me?

07:42.062 --> 07:44.932
I think it'll be good
for us to finally have
some time together.

07:44.965 --> 07:46.700
And what
about your brother?

07:46.734 --> 07:47.935
What about him?

07:47.968 --> 07:49.837
Ben's chaperoning,
isn't he?

07:49.870 --> 07:51.639
Trust me,
there is no way
Ben is going.

07:51.672 --> 07:54.274
He hates camping.

07:54.307 --> 07:56.677
Ever since he was a kid,
he's been terrified
of small animals.

07:56.710 --> 07:58.879
He's scared of
nature in general.

07:58.912 --> 08:01.281
He thinks
it's too unpredictable.

08:01.314 --> 08:03.651
Good news,
my fellow campers.

08:03.684 --> 08:04.918
That's right.

08:04.952 --> 08:08.021
You're looking at the
coolest chaperone ever.

08:08.055 --> 08:10.791
Oh, no, no, no. Ben.
You hate camping.

08:10.824 --> 08:12.259
I'm gonna
learn to love it.

08:12.292 --> 08:13.994
You are not qualified
to chaperone.

08:14.027 --> 08:15.529
Actually, I am,
because I'm faculty.

08:15.563 --> 08:18.799
Okay. Fine. But I think
you should know what you're
getting yourself into.

08:18.832 --> 08:19.867
You're not gonna
scare me, Jane.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.002
There will be numerous
small creatures out there.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.605
Creeping in the dark.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.707
And most of them bite.
I'm just saying.

08:26.740 --> 08:27.741
How small?

08:27.775 --> 08:27.908
Tiny.

08:32.880 --> 08:34.815
No. I can do this.

08:34.848 --> 08:36.083
No, you don't
have to do this.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.718
Yes, I do.
I just need
to find a buddy.

08:37.751 --> 08:38.118
No.

08:41.955 --> 08:42.556
So much for
that time alone.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.769
Fashion week is upon us

08:55.803 --> 08:59.707
and Donovan is
expecting perfection.

08:59.740 --> 09:02.009
And this is
nowhere near perfection.

09:02.042 --> 09:04.978
It is a competitive
job market out there, people.

09:05.012 --> 09:07.715
A cold, hard world,

09:07.748 --> 09:10.017
and I would hate for
you to have to enter it.

09:12.720 --> 09:13.687
Get back to work.

09:15.823 --> 09:18.759
Well, that was inspiring.

09:18.792 --> 09:19.827
It must be so
frustrating for her.

09:19.860 --> 09:21.762
What?

09:22.996 --> 09:23.764
Well, every time
we preview a new line,

09:23.797 --> 09:25.833
Beau Bronn
beats us to the punch.

09:25.866 --> 09:28.869
Yeah. It's frustrating
for all of us, India.

09:28.902 --> 09:29.136
That's what I meant.

09:31.739 --> 09:32.773
Right.

09:34.407 --> 09:35.643
Look, Jeremy,

09:37.845 --> 09:40.380
I know things have been
a little tense between us

09:40.413 --> 09:43.751
since that
whole wedding dress
debacle last week.

09:43.784 --> 09:45.018
Let me make it up to you.

09:45.052 --> 09:46.386
I booked
that place upstate
for the weekend.

09:46.419 --> 09:47.587
You knoIndia. one...

09:48.756 --> 09:50.924
What?

09:50.958 --> 09:53.093
I told you. It's over.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.997
I know.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.399
And I'm totally
fine with that.
I just thought

09:59.432 --> 10:00.901
if you didn't have
plans this weekend...

10:00.934 --> 10:03.070
I have plans this weekend.

10:12.746 --> 10:13.981
We haven't had
a chance to spend
a lot of time together.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.683
You know? Just us.

10:15.716 --> 10:19.419
So this is like your
first romantic getaway?

10:19.452 --> 10:21.789
It's not exactly
a romantic getaway.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.891
Well, it can be
if you want it to be.

10:23.924 --> 10:26.059
Maybe.

10:26.093 --> 10:29.797
I'm just glad
I finally get some
actual time with him.

10:29.830 --> 10:32.733
Jane Quimby.
You really like this guy.

10:33.233 --> 10:35.703
Yeah, I really do.

10:35.736 --> 10:37.004
Tell me more.

10:37.037 --> 10:39.940
Honestly?
I'm kind of nervous talking
about him right now.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.142
Is that a bad thing?

10:42.175 --> 10:43.844
No, no, no.
That is a very
good thing.

10:43.877 --> 10:46.814
I just want this
weekend to go well.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.817
Until recently,
our timing hasn't
been great.

10:49.850 --> 10:51.885
So, is he cute?

10:51.919 --> 10:55.689
Uh, he's really
incredibly cute.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.190
And smart.
And sweet.

10:57.224 --> 11:01.061
And the best
part about him is
he likes me.

11:01.094 --> 11:02.763
What's not to like?

11:02.796 --> 11:04.732
Thanks, Carter.

11:04.765 --> 11:07.000
Look, trust me,
you are going to have
a fabulous weekend.

11:07.034 --> 11:08.268
I can't wait.

11:14.141 --> 11:15.475
INDIA: Gray, can I
have a word with you?

11:15.508 --> 11:18.045
What do you want, India?

11:18.078 --> 11:19.913
I was just wondering.

11:19.947 --> 11:21.815
Who are you sending
to Beverly Hills
this weekend

11:21.849 --> 11:23.751
to take a look at
the new store location?

11:23.784 --> 11:27.454
Someone from
business affairs. Why?

11:27.487 --> 11:30.924
If it's okay,
I'd like to go instead.

11:30.958 --> 11:35.095
I think it's important
for us to be familiar
with the store locations.

11:35.128 --> 11:37.765
Okay. Go ahead.

11:43.771 --> 11:44.037
You're still here.

11:44.071 --> 11:45.939
I am.

11:47.040 --> 11:47.941
If it's okay with you,

11:47.975 --> 11:51.144
I'd like to bring
an assistant with me.

11:51.178 --> 11:54.281
Just in case anything
unexpected comes up.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.016
Whom did you have in mind?

11:58.251 --> 11:59.887
Me?

11:59.920 --> 12:00.988
Yes, you.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.757
Why me?

12:03.791 --> 12:05.926
India requested
you personally.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.260
I don't understand.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.897
Why would India
want me to go
anywhere with her?

12:09.930 --> 12:10.563
Exactly.

12:10.597 --> 12:13.000
So, do you
want me to go?

12:13.033 --> 12:15.769
I do.

12:15.803 --> 12:17.237
But I have this
really important...

12:17.270 --> 12:18.772
Tell me something, Jane.

12:18.806 --> 12:19.940
Do you trust India?

12:19.973 --> 12:21.909
I'm not sure if...

12:21.942 --> 12:23.010
Just answer the question.

12:23.944 --> 12:24.812
She's

12:26.213 --> 12:27.280
a little shady.

12:27.314 --> 12:31.318
I agree.
How long have you
had these suspicions?

12:31.351 --> 12:34.321
Oh, no, no, no. No, no.
I'm not suspicious.

12:34.354 --> 12:36.323
I just think she's

12:36.356 --> 12:37.457
a little shady.

12:37.490 --> 12:39.960
Which is why
I want you to go
with her this weekend.

12:39.993 --> 12:40.794
I need you to keep
an eye on her.

12:40.828 --> 12:43.063
I want you with her
every minute.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.865
I can't take
a chance right now.

12:44.898 --> 12:46.266
If India is up to
something shady,

12:46.299 --> 12:49.870
I want to know about it.

12:49.903 --> 12:50.971
Oh. But I think
that you could...

12:51.004 --> 12:52.072
That'll be all.

13:00.848 --> 13:03.250
Hi, it's me.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.052
Hey. Where are you?
The bus is about to leave.

13:06.186 --> 13:07.320
Change of plans.

13:07.354 --> 13:10.090
Let me guess.
The internship?

13:10.123 --> 13:13.326
I'm sorry.
Something really
important came up

13:13.360 --> 13:15.829
and it looks
like I have to
work all weekend.

13:15.863 --> 13:16.830
I know.

13:16.864 --> 13:18.031
I'm so sorry.

13:18.065 --> 13:20.300
No, don't
worry about it.

13:20.333 --> 13:22.569
I mean, I should expect
this sort of thing
by now, right?

13:22.602 --> 13:24.371
Trust me.
I would much rather be
with you this weekend.

13:24.404 --> 13:27.240
It's work.

13:27.274 --> 13:29.242
I really wish I could go
camping. I just...

13:29.276 --> 13:31.979
Can't. Again.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.181
Don't worry.
Have a great weekend, Jane.

13:50.030 --> 13:51.364
Jane's not coming?

13:51.398 --> 13:52.866
Stay out of it, Lulu.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.335
Sorry.

13:55.368 --> 13:59.106
No, no, wait.
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
take it out on you.

13:59.139 --> 14:01.909
It's okay.
Trust me, I get it.

14:03.076 --> 14:04.211
Where's Billy?

14:05.312 --> 14:07.147
If I had to guess,

14:07.180 --> 14:09.149
I'd say Jane needed
his help with something

14:09.182 --> 14:10.183
and he went
running to her.

14:11.318 --> 14:12.452
What else is new?

14:16.189 --> 14:18.158
Hey, let me
help you with that.

14:18.191 --> 14:18.825
Thank you, Ben.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.228
You are welcome,
Rita Shaw.

14:21.261 --> 14:25.132
I'm really glad
you changed your mind
about coming this weekend.

14:25.165 --> 14:27.968
So am I.
It should be interesting.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.436
As long as there are
no unforeseen incidents.

14:29.469 --> 14:32.205
(GASPS) Like squirrels
attacking the campsite?

14:32.239 --> 14:35.175
I don't even... I don't know
why you would even joke
about something like that.

14:35.208 --> 14:37.144
So where's Jane?
I haven't seen her.

14:37.177 --> 14:41.048
Yeah, her internship
decided to kidnap her
for the weekend.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.382
That's been
happening a lot.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.317
Yeah, it has.

14:44.351 --> 14:47.220
I mean,
I know she loves
it and everything.

14:47.254 --> 14:49.656
But it's kind of
taken over her life.

14:49.689 --> 14:52.125
I'm here to help
if you need it.

14:52.159 --> 14:52.960
Thanks.

14:52.993 --> 14:56.096
So do you, um,

14:56.129 --> 14:58.365
wanna sit together
on the bus?

15:00.067 --> 15:01.001
Todd already asked me
to sit with him.

15:01.034 --> 15:03.470
Of course he did.

15:03.503 --> 15:05.005
Then who am I
gonna sit with?

15:06.706 --> 15:08.308
You ready for
some fun, Quimby?

15:08.341 --> 15:09.442
Why are you wearing that?

15:09.476 --> 15:11.078
Do you know how to
tie a bowline knot?

15:11.111 --> 15:12.980
No, I do not.

15:13.013 --> 15:16.216
Todd taught me
the five essential
camping knots.

15:16.249 --> 15:17.117
Did you know
he volunteered in
the Peace Corps?

15:17.150 --> 15:19.152
Of course he did.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.255
Why are we not moving?

15:27.260 --> 15:28.161
Nice of you
to join us, Billy.

15:28.195 --> 15:29.496
Better late than never.
Right, Mr. Quimby?

15:29.529 --> 15:32.399
I don't know.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.967
What... Why? Why?

15:34.001 --> 15:35.102
Double Oh.ch knot.

15:36.769 --> 15:39.239
(SIGHS) Hi, Lulu.
Sorry I'm late.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.374
That was cutting it
kind of close.

15:41.408 --> 15:44.077
Yeah, I know,
I didn't think
I was gonna make it.

15:44.111 --> 15:45.445
Neither did I.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.482
So, why did you want
to take me this weekend?

15:49.516 --> 15:50.984
To assist.

15:51.018 --> 15:52.252
You could've
taken anybody.

15:52.285 --> 15:54.421
Yes. But I wanted
to take a nobody.

15:57.357 --> 15:58.725
We're not gonna
make the flight anyway.

15:58.758 --> 16:00.994
We're fine.

16:01.028 --> 16:02.529
We're never gonna make it.
The plane leaves in,
like, eight minutes.

16:02.562 --> 16:06.366
The plane leaves
when we tell it to leave.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.401
What?
Why would they...

16:19.546 --> 16:21.781
Wow.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.516
* Get up
We're on a mission

16:23.550 --> 16:26.353
* We're gonna, gonna
do it right

16:26.386 --> 16:28.455
* Just, just
forget it all

16:28.488 --> 16:31.391
* Let's go
Oh, oh, oh

16:33.193 --> 16:36.263
* We're done with
all this stressing out

16:36.296 --> 16:38.298
* Let's live it up
Turn it up

16:38.331 --> 16:40.433
* Time is feeling right

16:40.467 --> 16:43.470
* No more waiting
Oh, tonight's the night *

16:45.238 --> 16:50.177
Okay. You've seen
our three most
exclusive listings.

16:50.210 --> 16:51.378
Now comes
the tough part.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.446
Choosing.

16:53.480 --> 16:54.047
Well, I think
they're all fabulous.

16:54.081 --> 16:56.249
Of course
they were.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.450
Jane, which one
do you like?

16:57.484 --> 16:58.818
You're asking me?

16:58.851 --> 17:02.021
Well, you seem
to have an opinion
on everything.

17:03.590 --> 17:05.325
Well, if I had
to choose,

17:05.358 --> 17:07.494
I'd say my two
favorite locations are

17:07.527 --> 17:10.330
the one on Wilshire
and the one on Beverly.

17:10.363 --> 17:12.365
Let's send Gray
the one on Robertson.

17:12.399 --> 17:13.600
But you just
asked me for...

17:13.633 --> 17:15.202
That one was
my favorite, too.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.337
You will not
be disappointed.

17:17.370 --> 17:19.506
I'll just get
those papers sent to
New York right away.

17:19.539 --> 17:20.640
Thank you.

17:22.209 --> 17:23.510
Thanks for your help.

17:24.511 --> 17:25.378
(SIGHS)

17:29.416 --> 17:32.485
It says to
unfurl the tent.

17:32.519 --> 17:32.985
I already unfurled it.

17:33.019 --> 17:35.588
How can you tell?

17:35.622 --> 17:36.389
Are there pictures
in the manual?

17:36.423 --> 17:39.259
Yes, but they all
look like math,

17:39.292 --> 17:39.326
so I'm just
ignoring them.

17:42.129 --> 17:43.230
You guys need some help?

17:43.263 --> 17:43.363
I give up.

17:45.332 --> 17:46.633
I think that was a yes.

17:46.666 --> 17:47.267
Thanks, Billy.

17:51.138 --> 17:53.206
Wow, I wouldn't
have pegged you for
the camping type.

17:53.240 --> 17:55.308
Oh, there's a lot
you don't know
about me.

17:55.342 --> 17:57.244
Such as?

17:57.277 --> 17:58.378
Former Eagle Scout.

17:59.146 --> 18:00.580
Really?

18:00.613 --> 18:03.116
(BOTH LAUGHING)

18:03.150 --> 18:04.884
So, why were you
late for the bus?

18:04.917 --> 18:07.654
Oh, I had to drop Jane off
at the train station.

18:07.687 --> 18:09.622
You know,
traffic kind of sucked.

18:09.656 --> 18:11.291
I figured
you were with Jane.

18:12.292 --> 18:12.892
Is that a problem?

18:12.925 --> 18:13.293
No. I just...

18:16.563 --> 18:18.198
Let's just
finish the tent.

18:23.370 --> 18:25.405
All right.
That should
just about do it.

18:25.438 --> 18:27.674
Wow. It's perfect.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.509
Ha.

18:29.542 --> 18:32.245
Listen. Consider this
your home away from home.

18:32.279 --> 18:35.148
I will.
You're welcome..

18:35.182 --> 18:37.550
So, is this like
a hobby of yours?
Tent building?

18:37.584 --> 18:40.420
(LAUGHS) No. God, no.

18:40.453 --> 18:44.291
No, I'd say
carpentry is sort of
my part-time hobby.

18:44.324 --> 18:46.193
I spent a year in Haiti
rebuilding homes

18:46.226 --> 18:49.296
for families who
lost everything in
that earthquake, so...

18:49.329 --> 18:50.897
Amazing.
I didn't know you did that.

18:50.930 --> 18:53.933
Yeah. Yeah.
I don't like to
talk about it too much.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.202
Yeah, right.

18:56.469 --> 18:57.570
Sorry.
What's that, Ben?

18:57.604 --> 18:58.471
Nothing.

18:59.406 --> 19:00.473
Ooh.

19:00.507 --> 19:02.442
Having some
tent issues there?

19:02.475 --> 19:04.744
No, no, no.
I'm just...

19:06.213 --> 19:08.181
I'm just taking
a break is all.

19:08.215 --> 19:10.250
Okay. Well, listen.

19:10.283 --> 19:12.319
I got Rita's tent
up pretty quick.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.621
You need a hand,
I'm happy to tackle yours.

19:14.654 --> 19:17.624
No, I think I can
tackle mine just fine.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.626
All right,
fair enough.

19:19.659 --> 19:22.362
Hey, listen.
Make sure you dispose
of those properly.

19:22.395 --> 19:23.630
Don't wanna
attract any bears.

19:24.231 --> 19:26.533
Yeah.

19:26.566 --> 19:30.270
Rita, let me
show you the upstairs.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.638
No, I'm serious.

19:37.777 --> 19:39.712
Hey, Jane. It's Ben.

19:39.746 --> 19:45.218
Uh, are there bears
wherever I am?

19:45.252 --> 19:48.255
Um, I wish
you were here.

19:48.288 --> 19:49.689
I hope you're not
working too hard.

19:53.660 --> 19:55.562
Hey, Jenkins.
You want some potato chips?

19:56.463 --> 19:57.964
(DOOR CLOSES)

19:57.997 --> 20:00.567
Oh.
You look amazing.

20:00.600 --> 20:02.001
What are
you doing?

20:02.034 --> 20:03.503
None of
your business.

20:03.536 --> 20:05.004
Do you have
another meeting?

20:05.037 --> 20:07.674
Again, none
of your business.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.813
I'm meeting
with friends, okay?

20:13.846 --> 20:17.550
So, are they like
friend friends or are
they like business friends?

20:17.584 --> 20:19.286
What does it matter?

20:19.319 --> 20:22.221
It doesn't matter.
I was just wondering.

20:22.789 --> 20:24.657
Business friends.

20:24.691 --> 20:25.758
So, it is another meeting.

20:27.560 --> 20:29.028
Okay. I'm gonna stop
asking questions now.

20:29.061 --> 20:29.429
Good.

20:32.299 --> 20:33.566
What are you going to do?

20:33.600 --> 20:36.369
I'm probably just
gonna hang out in here
and watch some TV.

20:36.403 --> 20:38.671
Do you know they have
movies on here that are
still in theaters?

20:38.705 --> 20:39.572
So crazy.

20:40.373 --> 20:42.442
Don't wait up.

20:49.416 --> 20:52.819
* See that pretty little girl
always dressed in black

20:52.852 --> 20:57.457
* She's been
living on the edge
and she like it like that

21:00.460 --> 21:04.431
* Think I hear her coming
when I call her name

21:04.464 --> 21:07.834
* Yeah that pretty little girl
wanna play my game *

21:09.602 --> 21:11.571
Hey.
Can I buy you a drink?

21:13.340 --> 21:15.542
Oh. Um, yeah.

21:15.575 --> 21:16.576
I'll take a Shirley Temple.

21:17.744 --> 21:18.745
Okay.

21:26.886 --> 21:27.887
(GASPS)

21:37.664 --> 21:39.599
Hi, India.

21:39.632 --> 21:41.634
What are you doing?

21:41.668 --> 21:44.771
I just came down
for a drink.

21:44.804 --> 21:45.905
Go back to the room.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.677
You're Beau Bronn.

21:52.745 --> 21:53.880
Yes, I am.

21:57.149 --> 21:58.451
Come join us.

22:03.490 --> 22:06.893
I didn't realize
that you and India
knew each other.

22:06.926 --> 22:08.828
Oh, we've known each
other for a long time.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.329
Really?

22:11.831 --> 22:13.500
And what do
you do, Christopher?

22:13.533 --> 22:15.134
I'm a junior designer
at Threads.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.504
One of our best.

22:17.537 --> 22:20.407
What about you, Jane?
Are you a designer?

22:20.440 --> 22:20.973
Well, I've always
had a passion for...

22:21.007 --> 22:22.809
She's Gray's assistant.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.377
Yes. I am.

22:24.411 --> 22:27.146
So, Jane, how is Gray
doing these days?

22:27.179 --> 22:30.116
She's busy, obviously.

22:30.149 --> 22:30.817
She always
worked too much.

22:33.453 --> 22:34.687
Can I ask you a question?

22:34.721 --> 22:36.456
Of course she can.

22:36.489 --> 22:36.823
Why does Gray...

22:38.791 --> 22:39.559
Hate me?

22:39.592 --> 22:41.394
I wasn't gonna
put it like that.

22:41.428 --> 22:43.896
Jane. That's
extremely personal.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.798
It's fine.

22:45.832 --> 22:48.468
My relationship with Gray
has always been complicated.

22:48.501 --> 22:48.968
I guess she never
really trusted me.

22:51.170 --> 22:52.405
Looking back,

22:52.439 --> 22:54.607
I'm not even sure
if she trusted me
on our wedding day.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.444
Wait! What?

22:58.177 --> 23:01.414
Mmm. Rita.
One for you.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.451
Jenkins. One for you.

23:05.985 --> 23:09.489
How did you get it
so golden brown?

23:09.522 --> 23:11.624
A little thing
called timing.

23:11.658 --> 23:13.560
Ben, I've got
one for you, too.

23:13.593 --> 23:16.696
No thanks.
I prefer my s'mores
a little well done.

23:19.799 --> 23:21.100
(SIGHS)

23:21.133 --> 23:24.937
Wow, I am so glad
that we get to share
this weekend together.

23:24.971 --> 23:25.772
Me, too.

23:29.842 --> 23:31.444
TODD: This is what
it's all about.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.746
This is what
it's all about.

23:33.780 --> 23:35.748
Who wants to
sing some songs?

23:35.782 --> 23:36.849
I don't.

23:36.883 --> 23:41.988
* Kumbaya my Lord, kumbaya

23:42.021 --> 23:45.458
I'm gonna go check
on the kids' campfire.
Get a little fresh air.

23:45.492 --> 23:46.726
We're outside, Ben.

23:46.759 --> 23:48.461
Are we?
And yet I'm suffocating.

23:48.495 --> 23:52.765
* Kumbaya, my Lord, kumbaya

23:55.902 --> 24:00.640
* Oh, Lord, kumbaya

24:00.907 --> 24:04.911
So, let me
get this straight.

24:04.944 --> 24:08.848
You and Gray
were married once?

24:08.881 --> 24:09.882
Technically, we still are.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.818
Wait. Right now?

24:11.851 --> 24:14.621
Gray is currently married?

24:14.654 --> 24:14.754
To you?

24:17.690 --> 24:19.592
Does (CHUCKLES)his?

24:19.626 --> 24:20.026
Do you
know this?

24:20.059 --> 24:22.895
Of course I do.

24:22.929 --> 24:24.764
Frankly, I'm surprised
she didn't tell you.

24:24.797 --> 24:27.534
Did you know this?

24:27.567 --> 24:29.068
Yes, I did. Sorry.

24:30.703 --> 24:32.238
It's like I don't
know Gray at all.

24:32.271 --> 24:33.740
If it makes you feel better,

24:33.773 --> 24:35.675
that's pretty much
what our marriage was like.

24:35.708 --> 24:39.512
Listen, this was lovely,
but I have another meeting.

24:39.546 --> 24:41.681
India, please think
about what I said.

24:41.714 --> 24:43.550
Mmm-hmm.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.855
Good night.

24:51.991 --> 24:52.925
What did he want
you to think about?

24:52.959 --> 24:54.727
ItMy business..

24:57.096 --> 24:59.599
I told you to
stay in the room.

24:59.632 --> 25:01.568
YoIt was implied.at.

25:01.601 --> 25:03.302
India, I am not
staying in the room.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.605
You completely
ruined my weekend
by bringing me here.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.807
Why?
Did you have plans?

25:07.840 --> 25:09.709
With a guy?

25:09.742 --> 25:10.943
With a really good guy.

25:10.977 --> 25:12.812
He's not a good guy.

25:12.845 --> 25:13.946
HowTrust me.now?

25:13.980 --> 25:15.915
I know from experience.

25:15.948 --> 25:17.049
Uh, you don't know Nick.

25:18.818 --> 25:21.788
Nick?

25:21.821 --> 25:23.890
You were going
to spend the weekend
with a guy named Nick?

25:24.624 --> 25:25.592
Yes.

25:26.859 --> 25:28.861
Oh.

25:28.895 --> 25:31.831
Who did you think
I was gonna spend
the weekend with?

25:31.864 --> 25:35.868
Nobody.
Nobody. Forget it.

25:35.902 --> 25:38.805
(SIGHS) India,
what were you doing
with Beau Bronn, anyway?

25:38.838 --> 25:39.639
You wouldn't understand.

25:39.672 --> 25:39.906
Try me.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.979
He asked me to
come work for him.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.716
And whI said no. say?

25:49.749 --> 25:51.317
Then why did
you meet with him?

25:51.350 --> 25:53.085
It's complicated, Jane.
Not everything fits into

25:53.119 --> 25:54.386
your neat, little,
happy assistant box.

25:54.420 --> 25:57.089
And frankly, there's
nothing more to talk about.
I said no.

25:57.890 --> 26:00.860
Oh, Chris. You're back.

26:00.893 --> 26:03.129
Yeah. Beau gave me
the rest of the night off.

26:03.162 --> 26:04.664
Do you mind
if I hang out with
you two for a bit?

26:04.697 --> 26:06.666
Actually,
we were just...

26:06.699 --> 26:08.768
Not at all.
Let's get another round.

26:13.172 --> 26:18.144
But that summer,
the kid's creepy mom
wanted revenge

26:18.177 --> 26:19.946
for what had
happened to her son,

26:19.979 --> 26:23.750
so all the camp counselors
got notes that said,

26:23.783 --> 26:24.751
"I know what you did."

26:24.784 --> 26:29.789
They were scared.
And they had to stay awake

26:29.822 --> 26:32.925
or the mom would
go into their dreams

26:32.959 --> 26:35.995
and kill them
with her knife fingers.

26:36.028 --> 26:39.031
But they couldn't
stay awake forever.

26:39.065 --> 26:41.901
Eventually,
they fell asleep.

26:41.934 --> 26:45.838
And they died.
One at a time.

26:45.872 --> 26:47.740
Out in these very woods.

26:49.141 --> 26:50.142
Right over there.

26:51.410 --> 26:53.412
That happened
in these woods?

26:53.445 --> 26:56.415
Yup. Pretty scary, huh?

26:56.448 --> 26:57.984
I've never been
less scared.

26:58.017 --> 26:59.752
(ALL CHUCKLING)

26:59.786 --> 27:01.888
You just combined
a bunch of scary movies.

27:01.921 --> 27:02.922
That didn't even make sense.

27:02.955 --> 27:05.424
Not true at all.

27:05.457 --> 27:07.927
My neighbor's sister
was one of the camp
counselors who died.

27:07.960 --> 27:09.662
Nice try, Coach.

27:09.696 --> 27:11.430
Somebody else
Mind if I join you?

27:11.463 --> 27:12.665
Not at all.
Have a seat.

27:12.699 --> 27:15.668
I know a game
we can play.

27:15.702 --> 27:17.970
It's called
who would you save
in a sinking canoe?

27:18.004 --> 27:19.071
Sounds scary.

27:19.105 --> 27:22.108
No.
I've heard of this.
It's a trust exercise.

27:22.141 --> 27:25.411
Right.
If everyone here
were in a really big

27:25.444 --> 27:28.447
sinking canoe,
and you could only
save one person,

27:28.480 --> 27:30.016
who would you save?

27:33.119 --> 27:34.086
I'd save everyone.
Obviously.

27:34.120 --> 27:35.855
You can't
save everyone.

27:35.888 --> 27:38.257
Yeah. That's the dilemma.
You got to choose somebody.

27:40.860 --> 27:43.763
I have a question
for Billy.

27:43.796 --> 27:46.232
If you were
in a sinking canoe
with Jane and me,

27:46.265 --> 27:47.967
who would you save?

27:51.037 --> 27:52.138
Wait. What?

27:52.171 --> 27:54.106
Okay, this
was a bad idea.

27:54.140 --> 27:55.842
You don't have to
answer that, Billy.

27:55.875 --> 27:58.244
He doesn't have to.
I already know the answer.

28:01.013 --> 28:02.214
Lulu, wait.

28:06.252 --> 28:08.921
Okay.
Who's ready for
another scary story?

28:09.889 --> 28:10.356
Hey. What's going on?

28:10.389 --> 28:12.792
Nothing. I just...

28:12.825 --> 28:14.126
What's your
problem with Jane?

28:14.160 --> 28:16.729
I don't have
a problem with Jane.

28:16.763 --> 28:19.732
I have a problem
with the fact that
my boyfriend...

28:19.766 --> 28:22.134
If you're even
still my boyfriend,

28:22.168 --> 28:25.004
his life revolves
around another girl.

28:25.037 --> 28:28.841
And that girl just
happens to be Jane.
I mean, come on.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.142
Don't you think
that's a problem?

28:30.176 --> 28:32.812
That's the problem.

28:32.845 --> 28:33.813
What do you
want me to say?

28:34.914 --> 28:36.849
I want you to say that

28:38.150 --> 28:40.753
you choose me
over Jane.

28:42.855 --> 28:43.923
I can't do that.

28:45.825 --> 28:47.860
I'm sorry. I just can't.

28:56.268 --> 28:58.070
Ooh! Shirley Temple!

29:01.573 --> 29:03.342
Best Shirley
Temple ever.

29:04.911 --> 29:06.345
Shirley Temple?
You're hilarious.

29:08.347 --> 29:10.016
And so cute.
Isn't she cute?

29:10.883 --> 29:12.051
Thanks.

29:12.084 --> 29:14.020
She's taken.

29:14.053 --> 29:15.087
You have
a boyfriend, Jane?

29:15.587 --> 29:17.556
Yes.

29:17.589 --> 29:20.192
Well, maybe,
I think.

29:20.226 --> 29:22.028
You know,
I'm not really sure.

29:22.061 --> 29:23.562
How's the sex?

29:23.595 --> 29:26.165
(LAUGHS) What?

29:26.198 --> 29:28.200
We haven't
exactly...

29:28.234 --> 29:30.369
There it is.
They always like you
before you sleep with them.

29:32.104 --> 29:34.340
Sex ruins relationships.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.943
You know what
ruins relationships?

29:36.976 --> 29:39.178
Talking about relationships.

29:39.211 --> 29:41.881
I prefer to keep
it simple. Right, Jane?

29:41.914 --> 29:43.282
Yeah,
I like it simple.

29:43.315 --> 29:46.185
That's right.
No strings.

29:46.218 --> 29:47.319
Totally.
(SINGS) String-free.

29:50.322 --> 29:51.824
Because, you know,

29:51.858 --> 29:54.226
that's when they
stop talking to you,

29:54.260 --> 29:57.396
when the sex happens.

29:58.030 --> 30:00.232
I'm with Jane.

30:00.266 --> 30:02.234
Why tie yourself
down in a relationship

30:02.268 --> 30:05.337
when you can
just have fun.

30:05.371 --> 30:06.939
I could use another
Shirley Temple.

30:08.007 --> 30:08.340
I'll be right
back with that.

30:13.612 --> 30:15.915
How come you've never
slept with this Nick guy?

30:15.948 --> 30:18.985
I don't know.
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

30:19.018 --> 30:22.621
I guess it's
because I'm not sure
if he's the right guy.

30:22.654 --> 30:27.226
Well, you're in luck,
'cause there are at least
eight right guys here tonight.

30:27.259 --> 30:28.260
But, just so you know,

30:28.294 --> 30:30.829
no strings over there?

30:31.630 --> 30:33.299
That is wrong guy.

30:37.303 --> 30:41.107
You're good with them.
The students, they like you.

30:41.140 --> 30:42.308
I like them.

30:44.443 --> 30:47.246
So, how was Todd
and his guitar?

30:47.279 --> 30:49.015
Very moving.

30:49.048 --> 30:49.448
Of course it was.

30:51.350 --> 30:54.253
This isn't so bad,
is it?

30:55.454 --> 30:56.956
It's nice.

30:57.356 --> 31:00.126
I wish Jane were here.

31:00.159 --> 31:01.460
She would've had fun.
She was so excited
about this trip.

31:05.231 --> 31:07.333
Am I doing this right?
This whole taking
care of Jane thing.

31:11.703 --> 31:12.939
No.

31:14.040 --> 31:16.675
Wow. Thanks.

31:16.708 --> 31:20.646
No. All I mean is
there is no right way.

31:20.679 --> 31:23.315
And there's no wrong way.

31:23.349 --> 31:25.251
You just do the best
you can do, Ben.

31:28.087 --> 31:29.355
I don't think
this internship is
the right thing for her.

31:33.993 --> 31:36.062
Why don't you just
go down there?

31:37.696 --> 31:39.131
To her work?

31:39.165 --> 31:42.401
Yeah. Talk to them.
See what she's doing.

31:42.434 --> 31:42.501
Might make
you feel better.

31:45.137 --> 31:45.371
Yeah.

31:47.406 --> 31:49.175
I think I might do that.

31:50.142 --> 31:51.243
Thanks.

31:52.178 --> 31:52.478
Welcome.

get my drink.

32:25.411 --> 32:28.047
What?
I can't hear you!

32:28.080 --> 32:29.215
No! No!
No, no, no, no!

32:29.248 --> 32:33.019
Jane, you are not having sex
with wrong guy tonight!

32:36.388 --> 32:37.489
Hello? Hello?

32:43.295 --> 32:48.200
Those two are never going
to give us a real chance.

32:48.234 --> 32:49.335
You know that, right?

32:52.371 --> 32:57.476
I don't know about you,
but I'm tired of
being second best.

32:57.509 --> 33:00.546
And it sucks because
I really like Billy

33:00.579 --> 33:02.514
but I can't
compete with Jane.

33:04.183 --> 33:07.353
Lulu,

33:07.386 --> 33:09.421
come on,
you don't have to
compete with anyone.

33:12.058 --> 33:15.794
* Put on navy suits
and march and keep in line

33:15.827 --> 33:18.364
* Laugh at all
the silly people out of time

33:18.397 --> 33:23.402
* We count the minutes
till we heal it with our wine

33:23.435 --> 33:28.374
* We climb in bed with pretty
strangers and we cry, oh, oh

33:28.407 --> 33:31.310
* I'm not like that
I'm not like that

33:31.343 --> 33:35.481
* I don't wanna
hurt like they do

33:35.514 --> 33:39.418
* They find it hard
to be alone... *

33:44.623 --> 33:46.825
Thanks for picking
me up, Tommy.

33:46.858 --> 33:49.461
Hey. Anything for
my little brother.

33:49.495 --> 33:51.330
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

33:51.363 --> 33:53.132
Some hot chick
came by the other day
looking for you.

33:53.165 --> 33:55.334
Said she was
your girlfriend.

33:55.367 --> 33:57.203
Since when do
you have a girlfriend?

33:57.236 --> 33:59.371
I don't.
Not anymore.

34:00.472 --> 34:02.074
That is too bad.

34:02.108 --> 34:04.076
So, what you got
going on tonight?

34:04.110 --> 34:05.477
Oh, naw,
just some business.

34:05.511 --> 34:08.514
Nothing you'd
be interested in.

34:08.547 --> 34:11.550
Maybe I would
be interested.

34:18.290 --> 34:19.491
(FLY BUZZING)

34:19.525 --> 34:21.260
Man.

34:21.293 --> 34:22.494
So, you made it
through the night okay?

34:22.528 --> 34:23.629
No squirrel attacks?

34:23.662 --> 34:27.366
Yep. It was a good
night in nature.

34:27.399 --> 34:28.400
Really?

34:30.169 --> 34:32.504
No. I have a huge
confession to make.

34:33.305 --> 34:34.340
Okay.

34:35.541 --> 34:37.343
I haI know.ing.

34:37.376 --> 34:38.610
No, I mean,
I hate camping.

34:38.644 --> 34:41.613
I really hate
everything about it.

34:41.647 --> 34:44.283
I hate canteens.
I hate tents.

34:44.316 --> 34:46.185
I hate sleeping
on the ground.

34:46.218 --> 34:50.256
I hate when people gather
around a fire and sing.

34:50.289 --> 34:51.257
I hate that
when you're camping,

34:51.290 --> 34:53.325
for no reason, a stick
is a suitable utensil.

34:54.893 --> 34:56.395
And I'm very sorry,

34:56.428 --> 34:58.364
but I (GASPS)mores.

34:58.397 --> 35:01.633
The marshmallow
completely overwhelms
the entire snack.

35:03.535 --> 35:05.137
So why did you
come this weekend?

35:07.339 --> 35:08.307
Because I like

35:10.576 --> 35:11.443
you.

35:13.279 --> 35:16.282
And that easily outweighs

35:16.315 --> 35:19.318
all the things
I hate about camping.

35:19.351 --> 35:21.453
But I'm never gonna
be the perfect guy.

35:22.588 --> 35:23.722
Like Todd.

35:25.224 --> 35:26.592
Todd?

35:26.625 --> 35:28.527
Yeah.

35:28.560 --> 35:31.463
And you really,
really deserve

35:33.232 --> 35:34.433
the perfect guy,
Rita Shaw.

35:37.736 --> 35:39.605
* Is this just beginning?

35:41.340 --> 35:44.210
* Or is it just a heartbeat?

35:45.311 --> 35:48.314
You are perfect.

35:48.347 --> 35:50.449
* Or is it just
a second chance? *

35:59.225 --> 36:00.626
I love camping.

36:02.528 --> 36:04.162
INDIA: Wake up, Jane.

36:07.366 --> 36:08.500
JOw.!

36:11.237 --> 36:13.739
My head is killing me.

36:13.772 --> 36:15.707
What was in those
Shirley Temples?

36:15.741 --> 36:19.345
Mostly sugar.
Come on, get dressed.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.747
What are we doing?

36:21.780 --> 36:22.514
We're in
California, Jane.

36:22.548 --> 36:25.251
What do you think
we're doing?

36:31.723 --> 36:35.761
* They want to kiss
like the movies

36:35.794 --> 36:39.698
* Like we're under the sky
on the Fourth of July

36:39.731 --> 36:42.401
* An honest kiss
just won't suffice

36:42.434 --> 36:46.972
* They want one to remember
for the rest of their lives

36:47.005 --> 36:50.709
* American girls
know how to pretend

36:50.742 --> 36:54.446
* You can be Barbie
and I can be Ken

36:54.480 --> 36:58.317
* They'll take you to LA
and Never Land

36:58.350 --> 37:01.520
* And imprint your soul
with their Hollywood hands

37:01.553 --> 37:03.689
* American girls

37:05.457 --> 37:09.361
* American girls

Can I help you?

38:03.349 --> 38:06.051
Yeah.
I'm looking for Jane.

38:06.084 --> 38:07.085
She's out of town
on business, I'm afraid.

38:07.118 --> 38:09.455
No, I'm sorry.

38:09.488 --> 38:10.556
Um, Jane Quimby,
your intern.

38:12.658 --> 38:13.625
Intern?
(CHUCKLES)

38:13.659 --> 38:17.596
Jane's not an intern.
She's Gray's assistant.

38:17.629 --> 38:20.832
Assistant.

38:20.866 --> 38:23.735
She's in Beverly Hills
this weekend helping scout
locations for a new store.

38:23.769 --> 38:25.504
Is there something
I could help you with?

38:29.875 --> 38:32.811
No. I, uh...

38:34.112 --> 38:36.748
That, um...

38:36.782 --> 38:38.384
That about does it.

Thank you.

38:41.587 --> 38:42.621
Welcome.

38:50.396 --> 38:51.897
All right, fellas.
Here's how it's going down.

38:51.930 --> 38:53.765
Billy, you're coming
in the warehouse with me.

38:53.799 --> 38:54.900
JD, you're driving.

38:54.933 --> 38:56.468
I thought I was driving.

38:56.502 --> 38:57.536
I never said
you were driving.

38:58.169 --> 39:00.406
I'll drive.

39:00.439 --> 39:02.474
Look at JD.
He's built for driving.

39:02.508 --> 39:03.875
I need you on
the inside with me.

39:03.909 --> 39:04.910
The inside of what?

39:11.450 --> 39:12.818
Why do you
have a blueprint?

39:12.851 --> 39:14.686
We got to know the layout.

39:14.720 --> 39:16.388
I thought we were
just selling IDs.

39:16.422 --> 39:17.489
Yeah, well, not anymore.
We're branching out.

39:17.523 --> 39:20.426
What? Are you...

39:20.459 --> 39:21.793
Are you robbing
this place, Tommy?

39:21.827 --> 39:24.663
No. I got the blueprints
because I'm thinking of
adding a sunroom.

39:24.696 --> 39:25.764
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

39:25.797 --> 39:27.499
You did not say anything
about breaking and entering.

39:27.533 --> 39:30.536
You didn't ask.

39:30.569 --> 39:32.971
All right? Look,
let's just go over
the plan. Okay?

39:34.840 --> 39:36.408
I'm sorry.
I can't do this.

39:36.442 --> 39:38.677
What are you
talking about?

39:38.710 --> 39:40.912
You came to me.
You asked for this.

39:40.946 --> 39:42.948
I'm sorry, Tommy.
I'm out.

39:52.724 --> 39:56.862

never having another
Shirley Temple again.

still killing me.

something for you.

40:03.669 --> 40:07.172
You have something
for me?

40:07.205 --> 40:09.908
It's not a Birkin.
But it's all yours.

40:09.941 --> 40:11.943
And no one can
take it away from you.

40:11.977 --> 40:13.445

40:20.652 --> 40:23.021

40:25.691 --> 40:28.694

the wedding dress.

40:33.765 --> 40:35.634
It's okay.

40:37.569 --> 40:38.870
Besides, maybe now
that we're friends...
