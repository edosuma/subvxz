00:02.335 --> 00:05.422
{\an8}(Kirk)
Welcome to Panama City Beach!

00:05.505 --> 00:08.173
{\an7}We're moving into
a house on the beach.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.968
{\an8}Hey!

00:08.258 --> 00:09.968
{\an7}Jeremiah.

00:08.258 --> 00:09.968
{\an9}Codi.

00:10.051 --> 00:11.094
{\an8}What's up?!

00:11.177 --> 00:12.262
{\an8}(Nilsa)
And we're gonna find
a summer job.

00:12.345 --> 00:14.264
{\an7}We are gonna be
working beach service.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.391
{\an8}How you doing?
I'm Jeremiah.

00:14.347 --> 00:16.391
{\an5}Kayla Jo.

00:16.474 --> 00:18.601
{\an8}I see Kayla Jo in them
Daisy Dukes, man,

00:18.685 --> 00:19.936
{\an8}and my heart starts to beat
a little bit.

00:20.019 --> 00:22.605
{\an8}(laughing)

00:22.689 --> 00:26.609
{\an8}Jeremiah, everyone knows
I'm coming for you.

00:26.693 --> 00:28.486
{\an8}I'm jealous
of the damn plunger.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.155
{\an8}Ow! I'm gonna hurt
my lip injections.

00:30.238 --> 00:32.365
{\an7}(Gus)
Are you, like,
being for real?

00:32.448 --> 00:34.284
{\an8}I got fake boobs,
fake eyebrows, fake lips.

00:34.367 --> 00:36.745
{\an7}But I'm real as hell when
it comes to my personality.

00:36.828 --> 00:38.496
{\an7}I heard that,
give me some on that.

00:38.580 --> 00:39.205
{\an7}(Kayla Jo)
You gotta get my man.

00:39.289 --> 00:41.124
{\an8}You're a great bartender.

00:41.207 --> 00:44.294
{\an8}I have never seen a girl
as thirsty as Kayla Jo.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.754
{\an8}She's clingy, she's needy.

00:45.837 --> 00:47.464
{\an8}Nilsa is just
straight-up jealous.

00:47.547 --> 00:50.008
{\an8}You're being thot-ish
and you're being mean.

00:50.091 --> 00:51.426
{\an8}(Nilsa)
Whatever, what is it to you?

00:51.509 --> 00:57.223
{\an7}He's not gonna (bleep) you
and he'll never (bleep) you.

00:57.307 --> 00:59.601
{\an8}♪♪

00:59.684 --> 01:02.145
{\an8}(Jeremiah)
Panama City Beach!

01:02.228 --> 01:04.230
{\an8}♪♪

01:07.400 --> 01:08.568
{\an7}(Codi)
Don't be jealous.

01:08.651 --> 01:11.154
{\an8}If I was salty, why am
I calling my ex-husband?

01:11.237 --> 01:13.239
{\an8}Maybe you want him to buy
you some more ass implants

01:13.323 --> 01:15.658
{\an8}or fake eyebrows, or...

01:15.742 --> 01:18.328
{\an5}(Aimee)
She has literally said
nothing to you, Codi!

01:18.411 --> 01:20.079
You up here
talking (bleep)!

01:20.163 --> 01:22.665
{\an1}Thank you, because this
doesn't even involve him.

01:22.749 --> 01:26.294
{\an1}Stop talking (bleep) about
my friend's plastic surgery.

01:26.377 --> 01:28.171
{\an5}(Codi)
Nilsa is just
straight-up jealous.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.423
She wants
to hunch Jeremiah.

01:30.507 --> 01:32.634
{\an8}But he's about hunching
that girl he brought home.

01:32.717 --> 01:33.927
{\an8}She's throwing (bleep)...

01:34.010 --> 01:36.513
...say anything to me
'cause she's a child.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.556
I'm laying all of it
out here right now.

01:38.640 --> 01:40.934
He's not gonna (bleep) you,
and he'll never (bleep) you.

01:41.017 --> 01:42.602
{\an1}(Aimee)
Get the (bleep) downstairs.

01:42.685 --> 01:43.728
{\an1}Stop talking
to her like that.

01:43.812 --> 01:45.855
Get the (bleep)
back downstairs.

01:45.939 --> 01:48.817
(distant shouting
from house)

01:52.320 --> 01:54.197
(bleep bleep)

01:54.280 --> 01:56.658
Shut the (bleep) up!
Go back downstairs!

01:56.741 --> 01:57.408
No, 'cause she's
throwing salt...

01:57.492 --> 01:58.368
{\an1}No, she didn't
do (bleep)!

02:03.540 --> 02:04.958
{\an5}(Gus)
Really? Are you serious
right now?

02:05.041 --> 02:06.543
I'm trying to get to know
Ellen a little better,

02:06.626 --> 02:08.544
{\an8}but this place
is full of animals.

02:08.627 --> 02:09.963
{\an4}(Nilsa)
All I said was
she didn't apologize.

02:10.045 --> 02:11.464
{\an8}(Codi)
I'm not, I'm not
dealing (bleep).

02:11.548 --> 02:12.590
{\an8}I'm not dealing
with you, Aimee.

02:12.674 --> 02:13.925
Hey, what's
going on, brother?

02:14.008 --> 02:15.552
(bleep) Aimee.
(bleep) her.

02:15.635 --> 02:18.680
{\an8}Aimee? Aimee's
part of this now?

02:18.763 --> 02:21.015
{\an8}No (bleep) her.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.350
{\an8}You don't have to be sorry.
It's not your fault.

02:22.433 --> 02:24.310
You're just trying to
have a good time,

02:24.394 --> 02:26.980
and she's up there (bleep)
ruining that (bleep) for you.

02:27.063 --> 02:29.065
And that's what's kind of
pissing me off the most.

02:29.149 --> 02:31.734
(Jeremiah)
The tension is so thick

02:31.818 --> 02:33.444
between the girls
and the guys in the house.

02:33.528 --> 02:35.155
{\an8}I feel like I'm in the middle
of a war zone

02:35.238 --> 02:36.364
{\an8}right now to be honest.

02:36.447 --> 02:37.824
{\an8}And I have no idea
which side's gonna win,

02:37.907 --> 02:39.701
{\an8}let alone which side
will give up first.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.494
{\an1}(Nilsa)
She still ain't said sorry.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.622
Because you misunderstood her,
she has to apologize to you?

02:44.706 --> 02:45.748
She doesn't owe you (bleep).

02:45.832 --> 02:48.084
{\an4}(Kortni)
'Cause there was
a misunderstanding.

02:48.167 --> 02:49.878
{\an1}I feel, like, they should
both, you know, just...

02:49.961 --> 02:50.753
She doesn't
owe her anything.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.547
Why are you lying?

02:52.630 --> 02:55.717
{\an5}I'm-- I'm not lying at all.

02:52.630 --> 02:55.717
It's a misunderstanding.

02:55.800 --> 02:57.051
Last night,
I apologized.

02:57.135 --> 02:58.636
I said you're
a beautiful woman.

02:58.720 --> 03:00.096
And I said I thought
that this meant,

03:00.179 --> 03:02.473
"Hey, you're beautiful."
I smiled when I did it.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.058
I thought it was
squashed yesterday.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.102
So tonight,
I said hello.

03:06.185 --> 03:08.563
{\an5}You didn't really
acknowledge me,
and so I--

03:08.646 --> 03:10.064
I didn't see you tonight
until I tried to tap you

03:10.148 --> 03:11.107
on the shoulder and say,
"Hey, sorry about last night."

03:11.190 --> 03:12.442
{\an1}And so what does
she owe you?

03:12.525 --> 03:13.735
I'm not trying
to be rude at all.

03:13.818 --> 03:14.694
You are being rude.

03:14.777 --> 03:17.030
We're gonna go
to the pool.

03:17.113 --> 03:18.781
{\an8}It really hurts my feelings
that Jeremiah

03:18.865 --> 03:21.618
{\an8}wants to pick
this random girl over me.

03:21.701 --> 03:23.953
{\an8}I don't think
she's a genuine person.

03:24.037 --> 03:26.372
{\an1}(laughing)

03:26.456 --> 03:28.124
(Codi burps)

03:28.207 --> 03:30.418
{\an1}Hey, Codi, enjoy
your snoring, bitch.

03:41.554 --> 03:42.639
{\an1}No one cares about me,
I feel like.

03:42.722 --> 03:46.559
If I was 30 with no ass,
would they care about me?

03:46.643 --> 03:50.063
{\an8}Usually Nilsa, she could
probably get whatever she wants,

03:50.146 --> 03:52.398
{\an8}but Jeremiah really isn't
feeling it that much.

03:52.482 --> 03:54.901
{\an8}So, I feel, like, she's just
acting a fool straight-up.

03:54.984 --> 03:56.277
{\an8}(chuckles)

03:56.361 --> 03:58.112
This thing's made of steel.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.490
{\an4}You could (bleep)
beat this (bleep)
to the ground.

04:00.573 --> 04:02.784
{\an1}You could put this (bleep)
in its grave,

04:02.867 --> 04:04.827
and it would still
be left standing.

04:04.911 --> 04:07.080
Man, that girl is nuts.
(chuckling)

04:07.163 --> 04:10.291
{\an1}The autopsy guy would,
like, stop and be, like,

04:10.375 --> 04:12.502
"That thing's still alive."

04:12.585 --> 04:15.129
I just do not
appreciate (bleep) people

04:15.213 --> 04:17.548
treating other people the way
that Nilsa's treating her.

04:17.632 --> 04:19.007
You're not giving her any
attention that she wants,

04:19.091 --> 04:21.219
so she's freaking out.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.595
And she tried to
do that (bleep)

04:22.679 --> 04:24.097
{\an1}the second we walked
through the (bleep) door.

04:24.180 --> 04:25.348
{\an5}(Gus)
It's like the girls
in the house are programmed

04:25.431 --> 04:28.142
to make as much drama
as possible.

04:28.226 --> 04:29.227
{\an4}(Jeremiah)
Ellen's still here, right?

04:28.226 --> 04:29.227
Yeah, she's still here.

04:29.310 --> 04:31.312
{\an1}Well, then you
go do your thing.

04:31.396 --> 04:32.981
{\an1}I'm not gonna take
up your time.

04:33.064 --> 04:34.357
Bro, no, look, we're
in this together.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.776
And for everybody
else... Mwah!

04:36.859 --> 04:41.030
{\an1}Wave cute.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.699
It's not even about
hooking up at this point.

04:42.782 --> 04:45.368
I really just wanna spend
some time with girls

04:45.451 --> 04:48.413
{\an1}that aren't disrespectful,
little bitches at this point.

04:48.496 --> 04:49.706
{\an5}You know what I mean?

04:48.496 --> 04:49.706
{\an1}Yeah.

04:49.789 --> 04:52.333
Like, let's just
enjoy their company...

04:52.417 --> 04:53.584
And just see
where it goes,

04:53.668 --> 04:53.960
have a good time,
you know?

04:54.043 --> 04:55.878
{\an1}Yeah.

04:55.962 --> 04:57.755
All right, let's go,
they-- they miss us.

04:57.839 --> 05:01.384
We'll be a'ight.
We'll be all right.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.302
{\an1}(Jeremiah)
Kayla Jo!

05:03.386 --> 05:05.054
{\an1}You done talking
over there or what?

05:05.138 --> 05:08.141
{\an5}Sorry, I'm not trying
to-- I'm not trying
to steal your lady.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.226
{\an8}I really don't have a problem
with Kayla Jo.

05:10.310 --> 05:12.395
At the end of the day,
Jeremiah likes her.

05:12.478 --> 05:15.773
{\an8}So... it's all good
in the hood.

05:15.857 --> 05:18.109
{\an1}What are all your tattoos?
Tell me.

05:18.192 --> 05:20.361
{\an5}Which one?

05:18.192 --> 05:20.361
All of them.
I love tattoos.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.405
{\an5}Last name.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.405
{\an1}Last name.

05:22.488 --> 05:23.448
{\an5}You got your last name too?

05:22.488 --> 05:23.448
{\an1}Yeah.

05:23.531 --> 05:26.784
{\an5}That's awesome.

05:23.531 --> 05:26.784
And then I got a mandala.

05:26.868 --> 05:28.703
I'm Wiccan which means

05:28.786 --> 05:29.704
{\an5}that I practice
the White Light,
so, I believe--

05:29.787 --> 05:32.415
{\an1}I thought Wiccan was,
like, witchcraft.

05:32.498 --> 05:33.583
It means
that you believe

05:33.666 --> 05:35.293
in a higher spirit
besides God.

05:35.376 --> 05:36.919
{\an7}Okay, cool,
hell, yeah, girl.

05:37.003 --> 05:38.671
{\an8}Okay.

05:38.755 --> 05:42.842
Kayla Jo is a modern-day
version of a... witch.

05:42.925 --> 05:45.219
{\an1}(laughing)

05:45.303 --> 05:47.221
Maybe she can work her little
magic, flirt with Jeremiah,

05:47.305 --> 05:50.266
and make him fall in love.

05:52.685 --> 05:54.937
{\an8}Whoo, finally, yes.

05:55.021 --> 05:58.149
Things are looking good for
old Gussie boy at this point.

05:58.232 --> 06:00.318
(Codi burps, sighs)

06:00.401 --> 06:02.653
{\an5}What are you doing?

06:00.401 --> 06:02.653
(loud burp)
Excuse me.

06:02.737 --> 06:03.613
(laughing)

06:03.696 --> 06:06.240
Are you kidding me
right now?

06:06.324 --> 06:07.575
Codi's over here making
all kinds of noises.

06:07.658 --> 06:10.787
Grunting noises, pig noises.
(snorting)

06:10.870 --> 06:13.164
(loud burp, sighs)

06:16.209 --> 06:17.960
{\an7}I'll come up
there for a bit.

06:18.044 --> 06:21.047
I'm ready to have a little bit
of fun in my twin size bed.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.007
If you know what I mean?
Oh, man.

06:23.091 --> 06:26.886
♪♪

06:33.559 --> 06:34.644
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
I'm trying to be a little
romantic, put in some work.

06:36.062 --> 06:38.314
{\an8}Yeah?

06:38.397 --> 06:40.108
{\an8}Basically at this point,
I'm having a good time

06:40.191 --> 06:42.318
{\an8}with Kayla Jo
while Gus is over here

06:42.401 --> 06:44.112
{\an8}getting kissy face
with Ellen.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.280
{\an8}Despite all the drama
going on in the house,

06:46.364 --> 06:48.116
{\an8}we actually
pulled it tonight.

06:52.203 --> 06:54.872
(Codi snoring)

06:57.125 --> 07:00.753
(laughter)

07:00.837 --> 07:02.255
{\an1}(Gus)
Shut up, Codi!

07:02.338 --> 07:04.048
{\an3}(laughing)

07:04.132 --> 07:05.007
(snoring continues)

07:05.091 --> 07:09.345
(laughing)

07:09.428 --> 07:12.473
{\an3}Codi!

07:12.557 --> 07:15.351
(laughing)
No, this isn't happening.

07:18.062 --> 07:20.189
{\an1}Holy (bleep),
he stopped snoring.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.108
Come back here,
get back here.

07:28.531 --> 07:32.034
(Codi grunts,
liquid splashes)

07:32.118 --> 07:36.038
{\an3}(laughing)

07:36.122 --> 07:38.332
(splashes)

07:38.416 --> 07:40.877
Jesus Christ.

07:40.960 --> 07:44.547
(groans, burps)

07:44.630 --> 07:47.300
{\an3}(laughing)

07:47.383 --> 07:50.136
{\an8}(Codi)
Coming up...

07:50.219 --> 07:53.222
{\an8}Oh, we have a new roommate?

07:50.219 --> 07:53.222
{\an8}(laughing)

07:53.306 --> 07:56.392
{\an8}I see Kayla Jo going
through the fridge.

07:56.475 --> 07:58.352
{\an8}She opening it
like she live here.

07:58.436 --> 07:59.437
{\an7}Whoever's
lettuce this is,

07:59.520 --> 08:03.399
{\an7}I'm sorry
I'm fingering it all.

08:03.482 --> 08:06.027
{\an8}(Codi)
Girl... You ain't
gonna touch her!

08:06.110 --> 08:09.071
{\an8}This crazy lady comes out
of nowhere freaking out.

08:09.155 --> 08:11.282
{\an8}(shouting)

is baby moving in?

09:51.924 --> 09:55.678
I didn't know Jeremiah
had that effect on women.

09:55.761 --> 09:57.972
(Kayla Jo)
Are y'all hungry?

09:58.055 --> 09:58.639
This has
spinach and cheese.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.142
Do you like the spinach?

10:01.225 --> 10:03.227
I specifically
picked that out.

10:03.311 --> 10:05.354
She's gotta go back
to Nashville today.

10:05.438 --> 10:08.065
Gatlinburg!

10:05.438 --> 10:08.065
{\an3}Yes.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.734
{\an5}It's so beautiful.

10:08.149 --> 10:09.734
{\an3}It is.

10:09.817 --> 10:11.819
It's so pretty,
East Tennessee.

10:11.902 --> 10:13.529
{\an8}So, Ellen has to
hit the road.

10:13.612 --> 10:14.530
{\an8}She's headed back
to Nashville.

10:14.613 --> 10:16.532
{\an8}She's a sweet girl,
she's Southern.

10:16.615 --> 10:17.742
{\an8}She's got those qualities
that I look for,

10:17.825 --> 10:19.535
{\an8}so there might be
some potential there.

10:19.618 --> 10:21.871
{\an7}I'm glad I got to
cross paths with you,

10:21.954 --> 10:25.791
{\an7}even though it was
for two nights or whatever.

10:25.875 --> 10:29.795
{\an8}Gus is over here bummed out
about Ellen leaving.

10:29.879 --> 10:31.213
{\an7}I wish you didn't
have to leave.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.507
{\an7}I'll make my way
up there soon, I promise.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.676
{\an7}Here, kiss on it.
There.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.888
{\an8}Oh, my God, Gus is getting
feelings over a girl

10:38.971 --> 10:40.056
{\an8}that doesn't even live here.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.682
{\an8}She lives in Nashville,
for God sake.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.060
{\an6}Bye, babe.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.060
Bye.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.227
That ship is sailed.

10:45.311 --> 10:47.855
{\an1}Well, she's headed back
to Nashville, so...

10:47.938 --> 10:49.190
You sound like your
puppy just died.

10:49.273 --> 10:51.275
{\an1}(laughing)

10:51.359 --> 10:52.735
It's the <i> S.S. Never.</i>

10:52.818 --> 10:53.819
It's gonna be never.
(chuckles)

10:53.903 --> 10:57.073
{\an1}All right, guys,
y'all have a good day, bye.

10:58.824 --> 11:03.037
Take you to your,
uh... carriage.

11:03.120 --> 11:05.581
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
As far as Kayla Jo and I and
where we're going this summer,

11:05.664 --> 11:07.083
I'm open to anything
that happens.

11:07.166 --> 11:09.251
{\an8}Mwah!

11:09.335 --> 11:11.462
{\an8}Deuce.

11:11.545 --> 11:13.089
I'm definitely looking for
somebody to enjoy

11:13.172 --> 11:14.173
each other's company with,
have fun

11:14.256 --> 11:16.467
and don't let
this summer get wasted

11:16.550 --> 11:17.843
by petty bull(bleep).

11:22.848 --> 11:27.353
{\an8}Yeah, definitely.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.979
{\an8}Did you go on the beach?

11:29.063 --> 11:30.106
{\an7}Yeah, I was just
laying down.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.983
{\an8}I did let Kayla Jo
get the best of me.

11:33.067 --> 11:34.276
{\an8}But as of right now,
I'm just gonna put her

11:34.360 --> 11:37.613
{\an8}on the back burner and clear
the air with Jeremiah.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.824
{\an8}I'm here to enjoy my summer,
not focus on a girl.

11:42.910 --> 11:45.329
I really don't wanna
hate you, you know what?

11:45.413 --> 11:46.997
And I don't hate you.

11:47.081 --> 11:48.082
{\an5}But I don't want you
to think that I'm,
like, trying to,

11:48.165 --> 11:50.918
like, (bleep) block
you or anything.

11:51.001 --> 11:52.253
{\an1}I'm just trying
to figure out

11:52.336 --> 11:54.130
{\an1}whether this is a trend
with you or whether it's not.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.340
Oh, yeah, I understand.

11:56.424 --> 11:58.467
{\an5}And last, we shook
each other's hands
and squashed it.

11:58.551 --> 11:59.969
I'm good with her.

12:00.052 --> 12:03.347
{\an1}The trust thing there is
a little bit different now.

12:03.431 --> 12:06.475
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
I understand that Nilsa
is trying to clear the air.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.602
But honestly,
I feel like after last night,

12:08.686 --> 12:10.855
I'm gonna see how she acts
in other situations

12:10.938 --> 12:13.023
to actually feel whether
she's sincere or not.

12:13.107 --> 12:14.817
Well, thanks for
saying something.

12:14.900 --> 12:17.111
I guess that I'm still
just trying to feel...

12:17.194 --> 12:18.988
the people out
at the house.

12:19.071 --> 12:19.989
Yeah, and I just met you,
so, I mean, I don't...

12:20.072 --> 12:22.616
{\an5}Yeah, exactly.

12:20.072 --> 12:22.616
I don't even know you.

12:22.700 --> 12:24.743
I understand,
I understand.

12:24.827 --> 12:26.787
My name's Jeremiah.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.540
{\an5}I'm Nilsa, nice to meet you.

12:26.871 --> 12:29.540
Nilsa, nice to meet you.

12:29.623 --> 12:32.543
(line ringing)

12:32.626 --> 12:35.963
{\an3}Ellen.

12:32.626 --> 12:35.963
<i>Hey.</i>

12:36.046 --> 12:38.841
{\an5}I just wanna
check up on you.
You made it home yet?

12:38.924 --> 12:42.219
<i>Um, no, we're</i>
<i>still a few hours away.</i>

12:42.303 --> 12:44.013
Oh, I got you.

12:44.096 --> 12:45.097
{\an5}Well, I just wanted to call
and tell you that, you know,
I'm glad I got to meet you

12:45.181 --> 12:47.683
and hopefully I can
see you again some time.

12:47.766 --> 12:49.643
{\an5}(Kirk)
It's been less
than ten minutes.

12:49.727 --> 12:51.270
What the hell?
Like, what are you doing?

12:51.353 --> 12:53.481
I'll definitely make
a road trip to Nashville.

12:53.564 --> 12:55.274
I mean, I've been wanting
to come up there anyway,

12:55.357 --> 12:57.109
so now I've even
got a better reason.

12:57.193 --> 12:58.068
<i>(Ellen chuckles)</i>

12:58.152 --> 12:59.904
{\an8}You know,
I wanna catch feelings.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.489
{\an8}I wanna do this.
I wanna get to know you.

13:01.572 --> 13:02.865
{\an8}Shut up.

13:02.948 --> 13:05.326
{\an5}All right, so let's
plan on it, babe,
all right?

13:05.409 --> 13:07.369
You're in Panama City
for summer.

13:07.453 --> 13:08.871
You gonna meet
a bunch of Ellens, like,

13:08.954 --> 13:10.748
every time
we go out, like...

13:10.831 --> 13:13.626
It's okay, bro, like,
it's straight, you'll live.

13:13.709 --> 13:14.793
You take care, okay?

13:14.877 --> 13:16.462
<i>All right, thanks,</i>
<i>you too.</i>

13:16.545 --> 13:20.424
{\an3}Bye.

13:20.508 --> 13:23.010
Excuse me, sweetheart.

13:23.093 --> 13:24.261
{\an8}Wanna talk right now?

13:23.093 --> 13:24.261
{\an9}Yeah.

13:24.345 --> 13:27.515
{\an7}Okay.

13:27.598 --> 13:29.517
{\an8}Last night with the comments
that I made to Nilsa,

13:29.600 --> 13:31.936
{\an8}I was wrong, and I feel like

13:32.019 --> 13:33.562
{\an8}we definitely need
to clear the air.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.147
It was a low blow
when you was like,

13:35.231 --> 13:36.732
{\an1}"Why are you calling
your ex-husband?

13:36.815 --> 13:38.526
{\an1}So he can buy you more
of this, this and this?"

13:38.609 --> 13:39.652
{\an1}So, that really
hurt my feelings.

13:39.735 --> 13:41.695
So now, I'm, like, still
trying to get over that.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.572
Okay, well, I'm sorry.

13:43.656 --> 13:44.907
I didn't want it
to be like that.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.659
And, of course, now
a lot of this is al--

13:46.742 --> 13:48.035
That was alcohol
talking, too.

13:48.118 --> 13:49.411
Yeah, but you--

13:49.495 --> 13:50.371
{\an1}But I don't want it just
to blame it on that at all.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.915
{\an6}I don't.

13:50.454 --> 13:52.915
That's not the Codi I know.

13:52.998 --> 13:56.585
I don't think Codi understands,
like, how low he went.

13:56.669 --> 13:58.045
I'm still recovering
from my divorce.

13:58.128 --> 14:00.589
So, when I'm, like,
putting myself

14:00.673 --> 14:03.717
in the most vulnerable state,
I want my roommates to, like,

14:03.801 --> 14:05.219
comfort me and be, like,
you know what?

14:05.302 --> 14:06.804
You don't need him.
You're okay, put the phone down.

14:06.887 --> 14:09.098
Not scream at me
and then attack my appearance.

14:09.181 --> 14:12.059
'Cause then I just wanna lay
in my bed all day

14:12.142 --> 14:13.435
and go back
to the dark place

14:13.519 --> 14:16.188
I was in when
I first left my ex.

14:16.272 --> 14:19.108
If you really felt like
I was making fun of you

14:19.191 --> 14:21.318
with the Botox and the lips
and the-- the fake boobies,

14:21.402 --> 14:24.321
I really was not mean it.
Like, you joke about it.

14:24.405 --> 14:26.448
So, I thought,
like, you know,

14:26.532 --> 14:30.244
it was okay to...
discuss that.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.745
{\an5}I mean, I'm sure
you're proud of it
putting it in there,

14:31.829 --> 14:33.289
like, because it
looks (bleep) awesome.

14:33.372 --> 14:34.665
If my face could
look like that,

14:34.748 --> 14:36.417
I would put it in
my face every day.

14:36.500 --> 14:39.253
Last night, I was trying
to get through to Nilsa,

14:39.336 --> 14:42.965
but with my anger,
I feel like it turned around

14:43.048 --> 14:46.051
and it made it
be something else.

14:48.178 --> 14:49.972
We are besties,
I think.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.557
Yeah, sometimes.

14:51.640 --> 14:54.810
I accept his apology, but...
I'm gonna keep my eye on him.

14:54.893 --> 14:56.562
Well, give me a hug.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.982
{\an8}Don't burn me, though.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.982
{\an9}(laughing)

15:00.065 --> 15:02.359
{\an8}Codi is one of the chicks
in the house

15:02.443 --> 15:03.652
{\an8}when he's around us girls,
but when he's with the guys,

15:03.736 --> 15:05.696
he wants to try to act like
he's one of the guys.

15:05.779 --> 15:08.991
{\an4}Love you.

15:05.779 --> 15:08.991
Love you too.

15:09.074 --> 15:09.783
Now get the hell
away from me.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.870
(laughing)
You got it.

15:12.953 --> 15:15.039
You can't play the fence.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.665
You're either with us
or you're with them.

15:16.749 --> 15:20.169
Because right now, that's kind
of how the house is divided.

15:22.087 --> 15:23.922
{\an8}(Codi)
Coming up...

15:27.551 --> 15:28.552
{\an8}(Charlotte)
Aimee's taco soup

15:28.636 --> 15:30.429
{\an8}has given
some of the people the runs.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.306
{\an8}Ooh, ooh!

15:32.389 --> 15:33.474
{\an8}Damn, it's getting ugly
in here.

15:33.557 --> 15:36.435
{\an8}Whew!

15:36.518 --> 15:37.853
{\an7}I'm mad as (bleep)
right now 'cause
I'm being nicest one here.

15:37.936 --> 15:40.064
{\an8}Why are you mad?
Why are you mad?

15:40.147 --> 15:41.649
{\an8}All right, Kirk, don't let
these girls run all over you.

15:41.732 --> 15:42.524
{\an8}It's (bleep) chicken.

15:42.608 --> 15:47.071
{\an8}(sighs)

15:48.530 --> 15:50.240
{\an8}♪♪

15:50.324 --> 15:52.326
{\an4}You ready?

15:50.324 --> 15:52.326
It's time to go now?

15:52.409 --> 15:54.620
{\an1}I would so we can
get out there.

15:54.703 --> 15:55.954
I'm not driving.

15:56.038 --> 15:57.956
{\an1}Ohh.

15:58.040 --> 15:59.750
Somebody hold this.

15:59.833 --> 16:00.876
I have too much
stuff going on.

16:00.959 --> 16:02.920
Here, give me something.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.713
{\an8}Aimee is
a princess goddess mermaid.

16:04.797 --> 16:06.590
{\an8}She's very high maintenance.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.884
{\an8}You're already making
my stomach hurt this morning

16:08.967 --> 16:11.512
{\an8}'cause you aren't
doing what I asked.

16:17.810 --> 16:21.897
Aimee, you're almost there!
Come on!

16:21.980 --> 16:23.982
All right, guys,
if y'all wanna head out,

16:24.066 --> 16:26.151
go ahead and pop the umbrellas
and pick up al the trash.

16:26.235 --> 16:28.821
We got a lot of trash
between the dune line

16:28.904 --> 16:30.239
and down to the shoreline.

16:30.322 --> 16:31.865
{\an1}You could've said that
while I was way back there.

16:31.949 --> 16:35.744
Well, I had to
get you closer.

16:35.828 --> 16:37.246
{\an8}I dread work every day.

16:37.329 --> 16:39.957
{\an8}I'm biding my time until
I can become a trophy wife,

16:40.040 --> 16:43.544
{\an8}'cause that is my dream job.

16:43.627 --> 16:46.130
Come here!
(laughing)

16:46.213 --> 16:48.549
(bleep)!

16:48.632 --> 16:49.800
I'm tired of this (bleep).

16:49.883 --> 16:51.385
{\an5}(Kirk)
When I work with Aimee,
I already know

16:51.468 --> 16:53.011
that she ain't gonna do
a damn thing.

16:53.095 --> 16:54.680
She gonna be first one to get
fired for sure, I know that.

16:54.763 --> 16:57.099
I need my back rubbed.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.976
{\an4}Rubbed?

16:57.182 --> 16:58.976
Like massage?

16:59.059 --> 17:01.478
Aimee is the neediest woman

17:01.562 --> 17:03.814
I have ever met
in my entire life.

17:03.897 --> 17:05.357
Gus-Gus, will you
do me a favor?

17:05.441 --> 17:07.901
Somebody make me a drink
and let's go smoke.

17:07.984 --> 17:10.112
(Codi)
Oh, damn.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.530
Can you pick it up?
Just throw it away.

17:11.613 --> 17:12.656
Why I gotta pick it up?

17:12.740 --> 17:14.657
I can't behind over
in these underwear.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.160
I feel like my cooch
is hanging out.

17:16.242 --> 17:18.954
She has this pedestal
that she thinks she's on

17:19.038 --> 17:20.289
'cause she's a princess.

17:20.372 --> 17:22.415
Can you lay me back?
I'm trying to take a nap?

17:22.499 --> 17:24.752
Yeah, right.
(chuckling)

17:24.835 --> 17:26.627
Like, you're legs are working.
Your hands are working.

17:26.712 --> 17:27.921
My feet hurt!

17:28.005 --> 17:28.797
What else do you want?
You want a piggyback ride?

17:28.881 --> 17:30.048
Like, come on, woman!

17:30.132 --> 17:32.760
{\an5}(man)
Well, it's that
time of the day.

17:32.843 --> 17:33.510
Y'all can go home.

17:33.594 --> 17:36.013
{\an8}Let's go, bro.
Bye!

17:36.096 --> 17:37.931
{\an8}Whoo, my legs hurt.

17:38.015 --> 17:39.266
{\an9}Oh, my God.

17:42.060 --> 17:43.896
{\an8}(Kirk)
Yeah, right.

17:47.900 --> 17:50.486
(Nilsa)
Hey!

17:50.569 --> 17:53.447
That doesn't seem like
a half bad idea right now.

17:53.530 --> 17:54.531
It's kind of hot.

17:54.615 --> 17:56.158
{\an1}Hey, Codi, surprise me
with any kind of liquor.

17:56.241 --> 17:59.661
Hey, can you grab
me a couple plates?

17:59.745 --> 18:00.788
The chicken's ready.

18:00.871 --> 18:02.623
Hey, Codi, you want
a piece of chicken?

18:02.706 --> 18:04.208
Uh, yes.

18:04.291 --> 18:06.835
{\an5}Is this, uh, ready?

18:04.291 --> 18:06.835
Yeah, buddy.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.545
{\an1}Well, I want two
and she wants two.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.215
So, that's four.
Fours for whores.

18:11.298 --> 18:12.966
(Jeremiah)
I feel like the girls,

18:13.050 --> 18:14.760
every time we cook,
they act entitled.

18:14.843 --> 18:17.387
{\an8}They're more than welcome
to pitch in and help us out.

18:17.471 --> 18:18.931
Well, here's
some chicken.

18:19.014 --> 18:20.474
{\an1}You better get it
before it's all gone.

18:20.557 --> 18:22.309
Meal tonight!

18:22.392 --> 18:26.188
Chicken's ready.
If you want it, come get it.

18:26.271 --> 18:28.857
Or Foghorn's.
Ooh, Foghorn!

18:28.941 --> 18:31.068
{\an1}All I know is that chicken's
about to get cold,

18:31.151 --> 18:32.528
{\an1}so if they're not coming
after it, go for it, Kirk.

18:32.611 --> 18:34.905
{\an5}(Nilsa)
Wait, so that chicken
ain't for us?

18:34.988 --> 18:37.658
{\an8}(Jeremiah)
Hell, you seasoned it,
man, go nuts.

18:39.660 --> 18:41.662
{\an8}Yeah, I don't think that's
gonna be enough chicken.

18:41.745 --> 18:43.038
Yeah, I thought
it was a lot more.

18:43.121 --> 18:44.331
We can make more.

18:44.414 --> 18:46.125
(Codi)
Yeah, eat that.

18:46.208 --> 18:48.043
Looks nice and crispy.

18:48.126 --> 18:50.712
It's nice
and smoked, too.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.965
Mmm!

18:50.796 --> 18:52.965
{\an1}Good, eh?

18:53.048 --> 18:54.883
Let me go get my chicken
before it's gone.

18:54.967 --> 18:56.051
{\an5}Well, bring me a--

18:54.967 --> 18:56.051
I'm just gonna eat
my chicken...

18:56.134 --> 18:58.637
{\an1}Hey, will you bring
me a paper plate?

19:01.849 --> 19:05.227
One chicken?

19:05.310 --> 19:06.937
{\an1}Well, I guess we just
get one for now.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.605
Whatever.

19:08.689 --> 19:09.898
(Aimee)
What the (bleep)!

19:09.982 --> 19:11.775
They just told us
the chicken was ready

19:11.859 --> 19:13.735
and now it's gone.

19:13.819 --> 19:15.904
I am not happy about that.

19:18.282 --> 19:20.659
I don't know because
they limited to me

19:20.742 --> 19:22.035
and Nilly to how
many pieces we got.

19:22.119 --> 19:24.413
So, I don't know if there's
any more or not, because--

19:24.496 --> 19:26.582
{\an5}Are you serious?

19:24.496 --> 19:26.582
Me and Nilly got one a piece.

19:26.665 --> 19:28.792
For real, thought?
That's messed up.

19:28.876 --> 19:29.835
I don't like that.

19:29.918 --> 19:32.212
{\an1}Let me go get clarity
on what's going on.

19:32.296 --> 19:33.505
Yeah, come on.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.173
(loud burp)

19:35.257 --> 19:37.342
(Candace)
I just woke up.

19:37.426 --> 19:37.801
Oh, there's some chicken
right there for you.

19:37.885 --> 19:40.095
Yes, we do.

19:40.178 --> 19:42.556
Okay, so, my understanding
was that

19:42.639 --> 19:43.599
girls are only allowed
to get one piece?

19:43.682 --> 19:45.350
{\an5}Who said that?

19:43.682 --> 19:45.350
That's what Aimee said.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.436
Aimee said
that she get one piece

19:47.519 --> 19:49.104
and she said, uh,
Nilsa get one a piece.

19:49.187 --> 19:50.898
{\an1}So now they wanna
(bleep) lie?

19:50.981 --> 19:52.024
{\an1}I oughta (bleep)
with this bitch, dog.

19:52.107 --> 19:53.609
I'm coming-- that's why
I came down here to ask.

19:53.692 --> 19:55.819
I'm sorry if we seasoned it
and cooked it

19:55.903 --> 19:57.946
while they were sitting
in the pool, like--

19:58.030 --> 19:59.114
And it was getting cold.

19:59.197 --> 20:00.324
I was, like, you know what,
screw it, Kirk.

20:00.407 --> 20:01.700
Eat as much as you want.

20:01.783 --> 20:03.327
If they're not gonna get out
of the pool and get it.

20:03.410 --> 20:04.620
{\an6}Hold on.

20:03.410 --> 20:04.620
{\an1}Yeah.

20:04.703 --> 20:07.831
{\an1}We tell you food's done.
Come get the (bleep) food.

20:07.915 --> 20:09.458
{\an1}You don't get
the (bleep) food.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.169
The food gets (bleep) ate.
That's how it (bleep) work.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.462
{\an8}All right, Kirk,
I see you stand your ground.

20:13.545 --> 20:16.006
{\an8}Don't let these girls
run all over you.

20:16.089 --> 20:18.091
I'm about to go light
these Jesus candles,

20:18.175 --> 20:19.301
and I hope
somebody says something.

20:19.384 --> 20:21.136
{\an1}We called it out,
straight up.

20:21.219 --> 20:22.471
That's the case.

20:22.554 --> 20:24.139
And then when they tell you
that there's only one piece

20:24.222 --> 20:25.933
{\an1}a female, that (bleep)
pisses me off.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.100
{\an5}Okay, that's why I asked.

20:26.016 --> 20:27.100
{\an1}It does.

20:27.184 --> 20:28.644
Kirk, that's why I asked.

20:28.727 --> 20:31.146
{\an4}Who said there's only one
piece for the females?

20:28.727 --> 20:31.146
Aimee said that.

20:31.230 --> 20:32.481
{\an3}Aimee said that there
was only one piece.

20:32.564 --> 20:33.774
(Aimee)
I said that.

20:33.857 --> 20:36.652
{\an5}Why did you say that?

20:33.857 --> 20:36.652
It was a misunderstanding.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.279
{\an4}But how much was there
when we said the (bleep)
was ready?

20:39.363 --> 20:40.781
Why are you talking...

20:40.864 --> 20:42.157
{\an4}'Cause I'm mad
as (bleep) right now
'cause I'm nice enough...

20:42.240 --> 20:43.951
Why are you mad?
Why are you mad?

20:44.034 --> 20:45.577
It's (bleep) chicken.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.788
{\an1}For y'all, and we asked you--
We tell you all it's ready,

20:47.871 --> 20:49.498
{\an4}y'all wait till we eat it.
then it's, like,
"Oh, like, what the (bleep)?"

20:49.581 --> 20:52.459
You know what?
How you just talked to me.

20:52.542 --> 20:54.670
{\an5}I thought-- uh, no,
I thought you were
better than that.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.880
{\an4}I am better than that,
but right now
I'm (bleep) bitter.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.840
(Aimee)
Jesus take the wheel.

20:58.924 --> 21:01.176
He is upset about chicken.

21:01.259 --> 21:04.054
I feel like every
single one of the boys

21:04.137 --> 21:05.222
is on their (bleep) period.

21:05.305 --> 21:11.019
{\an1}We tell you food's done.
Come get the (bleep) food.

21:11.103 --> 21:13.105
{\an8}(Codi)
Coming up...

21:13.188 --> 21:14.523
{\an8}(overlapping shouting
and beeping)

21:14.606 --> 21:18.110
{\an8}All right, bitch!
Let's (bleep) get it!

21:18.193 --> 21:20.654
{\an8}(shouting and beeping)

21:20.737 --> 21:23.824
Kortni decide who we hitting
and just swing.

21:29.496 --> 21:32.082
♪♪

21:32.165 --> 21:35.377
{\an4}(Kirk)
I get mad, but I'ma get
over it, obviously, like.

21:35.460 --> 21:38.630
{\an1}I get over (bleep)
quickly, like... Whoo-hoo!

21:38.714 --> 21:40.465
{\an1}God!

21:40.549 --> 21:43.010
Golly.
Meatheads.

21:43.093 --> 21:44.886
They want so much from us.

21:44.970 --> 21:47.931
{\an4}If food's on the grill,
we gotta expect to
give them some.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.058
{\an5}I thought I was gonna
be moving to a house
with a bunch of, like,

21:50.142 --> 21:52.602
{\an5}cool ass dudes
and we were all
gonna get along.

21:52.686 --> 21:53.937
They're bitches.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.856
{\an8}(Nilsa)
I feel, like, we're kids
on a playground,

21:55.939 --> 21:57.691
{\an8}and it's literally
girls against boys.

21:57.774 --> 21:59.693
I don't wanna
live in a house

21:59.776 --> 22:00.861
where it's a bunch
of hostility,

22:00.944 --> 22:04.573
because that's literally
what I ran away from.

22:04.656 --> 22:06.491
Yeah, me too.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.909
{\an1}I just don't wanna go
all summer hating everyone.

22:07.993 --> 22:09.369
You know what I mean?

22:09.453 --> 22:10.287
{\an1}Or them hating me 'cause
I literally have done

22:10.370 --> 22:11.997
nothing personally to them.

22:12.080 --> 22:13.957
Well, then stop
apologizing for it.

22:14.041 --> 22:15.250
'Cause I don't (bleep)
apologize for it.

22:15.333 --> 22:17.627
{\an1}I know, I just feel like--
I don't know.

22:17.711 --> 22:20.255
I seen you've get heated,

22:20.338 --> 22:21.715
{\an1}but, like, as far
as that heated,

22:21.798 --> 22:23.467
{\an1}I've never seen that side,
I mean, like...

22:23.550 --> 22:24.760
That's not a side
that comes out.

22:24.843 --> 22:27.637
{\an5}I try to avoid that,
but that just got
under my skin.

22:27.721 --> 22:32.601
Like, I get mad if, like,
we're really doing (bleep)

22:32.684 --> 22:34.770
for y'all and you
don't appreciate it.

22:34.853 --> 22:37.564
{\an4}This summer's supposed
to be about me, like,
getting over it

22:37.647 --> 22:39.357
{\an4}and meeting new people
and...

22:37.647 --> 22:39.357
{\an3}Me too.

22:39.441 --> 22:40.650
{\an1}That's it.

22:40.734 --> 22:42.110
And when they talk
to me like that,

22:42.194 --> 22:43.278
you know what it
makes me want to do?

22:43.361 --> 22:46.156
{\an3}Call my ex.

22:43.361 --> 22:46.156
Yeah, exactly.

22:46.239 --> 22:47.449
(Nilsa)
Sometimes I feel so vulnerable,

22:47.532 --> 22:50.285
I want to pick up the phone
and call my ex-husband,

22:50.368 --> 22:52.788
because he knows,
like, every single part of me.

22:52.871 --> 22:54.581
And at one time, he loved
every single part of me.

22:54.664 --> 22:57.626
It's kind of weird,
but it makes me feel

22:57.709 --> 22:59.252
like somebody wants me.

22:59.336 --> 23:01.213
The thing is when you're
with a man for so long,

23:01.296 --> 23:03.090
it like, literally (bleep)
you up in the head.

23:03.173 --> 23:05.467
{\an1}I know, and they don't
understand that.

23:05.550 --> 23:07.094
Aimee and I have
a lot in common

23:07.177 --> 23:09.096
when it comes to, like,
selfish exes and broken hearts.

23:09.179 --> 23:10.347
So, she understands

23:10.430 --> 23:12.599
because we're kind of going
through the same thing.

23:12.682 --> 23:14.601
{\an1}Ahh!

23:14.684 --> 23:16.770
{\an5}(Jeremiah)
And the thing
of it is--

23:16.853 --> 23:18.313
{\an1}I just hate not being
appreciated

23:18.396 --> 23:21.691
{\an1}when you're doing stuff
to be-- appreciative of stuff.

23:21.775 --> 23:24.778
{\an1}And that does go back to how,
like, I was brought up.

23:24.861 --> 23:26.905
{\an5}That's my point,
the same.

23:24.861 --> 23:26.905
{\an1}Exactly

23:26.988 --> 23:28.949
{\an1}And if you're not respecting
the fact that I'm cleaning

23:29.032 --> 23:30.075
and cooking for your asses,

23:30.158 --> 23:32.577
then you don't have
any respect for me.

23:32.661 --> 23:34.746
{\an1}None.
You're my dog.

23:34.830 --> 23:35.372
Roof.
(laughing)

23:35.455 --> 23:37.833
You're my dog... Whoo!

23:37.916 --> 23:39.459
(both grunting in rhythm)

23:39.543 --> 23:41.586
But, no, I'm glad
you came out here

23:41.670 --> 23:42.587
{\an1}to talk to me
about that.

23:42.671 --> 23:43.630
{\an1}But that's some
real (bleep), bro.

23:43.713 --> 23:44.965
{\an5}It really is.

23:43.713 --> 23:44.965
{\an3}Yeah.

23:45.048 --> 23:46.341
I just wanted to make
sure with you, man.

23:46.424 --> 23:48.093
{\an8}I calmed down,
and I kind of regret

23:48.176 --> 23:49.177
{\an8}the way I talked
to the girls.

23:49.261 --> 23:50.470
{\an8}It was kind of mean,
you know, kind of

23:50.554 --> 23:52.013
{\an8}raised my voice
a little bit.

23:52.097 --> 23:53.056
{\an1}Sometimes you just can't
help your tone, bro.

23:53.140 --> 23:55.267
You just turn up.

23:55.350 --> 23:56.768
I don't regret
why I did it,

23:56.852 --> 23:59.146
but I do
regret how I did it.

23:59.229 --> 24:01.690
{\an1}Aimee, I apologize
for my tone, I really do.

24:01.773 --> 24:02.774
{\an1}And I love you to death,
I swear.

24:02.858 --> 24:04.651
{\an1}You can ask anyone.
I do, I love you to death.

24:04.734 --> 24:08.280
{\an1}I apologize for my tone.
I just-- I don't know.

24:08.363 --> 24:10.782
{\an5}I just thought
this summer was gonna
be a lot different.

24:10.866 --> 24:11.867
I thought it was
gonna be like...

24:11.950 --> 24:14.870
everybody was friends,
and it's not.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.581
{\an5}There's more drama here
than there is
in Perdido, Alabama.

24:17.664 --> 24:18.582
I'd rather deal
with my boyfriend

24:18.665 --> 24:20.876
having a baby
with someone else

24:20.959 --> 24:23.044
than deal with all
this crazy (bleep).

24:23.128 --> 24:24.379
{\an1}I'm-- it's--
I'm-- I'm in the wrong

24:24.462 --> 24:27.382
in the way I was
raising my voice.

24:27.465 --> 24:29.634
But I was upset for
a legitimate reason.

24:29.718 --> 24:32.345
{\an4}'Cause honestly,
we did offer, like,
the chicken and, like,

24:32.429 --> 24:34.389
we started eating it,
but it wasn't like...

24:34.472 --> 24:36.141
{\an1}we're just trying to
eat it in front of y'all.

24:36.224 --> 24:37.559
No, I knew-- I know that.

24:37.642 --> 24:39.186
That's what I'm saying,
I apologize, I'm sorry.

24:39.269 --> 24:40.854
{\an1}I shouldn't have raised
my voice at you like I did.

24:40.937 --> 24:41.980
{\an1}I'm in the (bleep) wrong
on that, I really am.

24:42.063 --> 24:43.607
{\an1}You just been krunk all day.
I love you, though.

24:43.690 --> 24:47.736
{\an5}You're, like, my favorite.

24:43.690 --> 24:47.736
You're my favorite, too.

24:47.819 --> 24:48.236
{\an3}Hey!

24:48.320 --> 24:50.614
(both laughing)

24:50.697 --> 24:52.616
{\an8}I'm glad Kirk's apologizing.

24:52.699 --> 24:55.410
{\an8}But, Kirk, don't ever
let that happen again.

24:55.493 --> 24:57.120
{\an8}That's it.
It's squashed.

24:57.204 --> 24:58.413
And from here on,
we're gonna be fine.

24:58.496 --> 25:01.333
{\an8}(Codi)
Coming up...

25:04.836 --> 25:05.837
{\an8}Tell your wife or I'll
knock you the (bleep) out!

25:05.921 --> 25:08.256
{\an7}What?!

25:08.340 --> 25:11.301
{\an8}These men are begging
to get slapped by me.

25:11.384 --> 25:13.470
(screaming and shouting)

25:16.181 --> 25:19.267
♪♪

25:20.769 --> 25:21.603
{\an5}(Aimee)
Are y'all proud
of me for cooking?

25:21.686 --> 25:23.480
{\an1}Well, let's see
what it looks like.

25:23.563 --> 25:26.608
(Aimee)
The men in the house

25:26.691 --> 25:29.277
{\an8}always complain
and say Aimee don't cook,

25:29.361 --> 25:30.570
{\an8}Aimee don't do this.

25:30.654 --> 25:32.948
And now they're hollering at me
over chicken wings.

25:33.031 --> 25:35.283
You need help with anything
or you got this whole thing?

25:35.367 --> 25:37.994
I got this whole thing.
I am a cook.

25:38.078 --> 25:41.790
All the drama in the house
is kind of, like, divided.

25:41.873 --> 25:43.500
The girls against the guys.

25:45.210 --> 25:47.128
Taco soup.

25:47.212 --> 25:48.797
I'm cooking taco soup
'cause I'm trying to bring

25:48.880 --> 25:53.051
all my dysfunctional
roommates together.

25:53.134 --> 25:53.927
So, Aimee,
are we good--

25:54.010 --> 25:55.971
Aimee is cooking
all by herself.

25:56.054 --> 25:56.846
Okay.

25:56.930 --> 25:59.307
(Aimee)
I grew up super poor.

25:59.391 --> 26:00.267
This is, like, kind of
embarrassing,

26:00.350 --> 26:02.394
but I don't know
how to cook fancy.

26:02.477 --> 26:04.229
What's in taco soup?

26:04.312 --> 26:05.647
{\an1}Yeah, I gotta
know what's in it.

26:05.730 --> 26:07.148
We had no money.

26:07.232 --> 26:09.234
I don't go
to fancy restaurant.

26:09.317 --> 26:12.153
I know how to cook taco soup
or ramen noodles.

26:12.237 --> 26:13.655
That's all I can do.

26:13.738 --> 26:18.868
It's... there's corn, chili
beans, tomatoes, taco seasoning.

26:18.952 --> 26:20.120
I don't have a recipe.

26:20.203 --> 26:22.080
I just add all kinds
of (bleep) together.

26:22.163 --> 26:25.333
My roommates are gonna be
so surprised.

26:25.417 --> 26:28.503
This is really good
old country-ass food.

26:28.586 --> 26:29.421
How do I turn this damn
thing off?

26:29.504 --> 26:31.881
Oh, I did it, okay.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.174
Are you serious
right now?

26:33.258 --> 26:34.718
I burned the bottom
of the pan a little bit.

26:34.801 --> 26:37.137
I see the worry
in your eyes.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.347
{\an4}I'm worried
'cause I'm hungry.

26:37.220 --> 26:39.347
Yeah, I can tell.

26:39.431 --> 26:41.683
This looks like slop.

26:41.766 --> 26:43.435
{\an1}'Cause, see, I don't know
how to pour grease out.

26:43.518 --> 26:45.186
{\an8}The boys are the one
that does all the cooking.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.314
Hey, supper's ready.

26:47.397 --> 26:50.525
So, honestly, I don't
really know how I feel

26:50.608 --> 26:52.027
about eating this food
that Aimee made.

26:52.110 --> 26:54.988
Bless the beautiful Aimee for
preparing this wonderful meal.

26:55.071 --> 26:58.325
Good food, good looking.
Good meat, let's eat, amen.

26:58.408 --> 26:59.868
(all)
Amen.

26:59.951 --> 27:00.577
{\an1}(sighs)

27:00.660 --> 27:02.704
(woman clears throat)

27:02.787 --> 27:04.289
{\an4}All right.

27:02.787 --> 27:04.289
(man)
Yes, sir.

27:04.372 --> 27:05.749
(woman clears throat)

27:07.167 --> 27:09.961
Everybody's looking around,
like, "You take the first bite.

27:10.045 --> 27:11.629
"No, no, no,
you take the first bite.

27:11.713 --> 27:13.381
No, no, really, I insist,
you take the first bite."

27:13.465 --> 27:16.676
(woman clearing throat)

27:17.635 --> 27:19.512
(clears throat)

27:19.596 --> 27:21.973
(Aimee)
I am super "self-conscience."

27:22.057 --> 27:23.433
I'm sweating like a whore
in church.

27:23.516 --> 27:25.226
I hope they like it.

27:25.310 --> 27:26.144
I'm gonna try it.

27:32.901 --> 27:36.196
I'm starting to sweat
a little bit, yeah?

27:36.279 --> 27:37.739
Bro, it's hot.

27:38.907 --> 27:40.617
(Nilsa)
Yeah, it is really hot.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.160
{\an5}Aimee, this is good.

27:40.700 --> 27:42.160
{\an1}Is it?

27:42.243 --> 27:43.745
{\an5}(Kirk)
It's the first time
I've seen Aimee cooking.

27:43.828 --> 27:45.372
So, you know,
I appreciate that.

27:45.455 --> 27:47.040
I am so proud of you.

27:47.123 --> 27:48.375
{\an1}Mm-hmm.

27:48.458 --> 27:50.794
Damn, Ma.

27:50.877 --> 27:52.420
You might be
wife material.

27:52.504 --> 27:54.756
(chuckling)

27:54.839 --> 28:00.428
I feel like a princess-goddess-
mermaid that can cook.

28:00.512 --> 28:03.348
{\an5}(Gus)
It's really good to sit down
and talk to everybody.

28:03.431 --> 28:04.808
I know we've had a lot
of fights and a lot of drama.

28:04.891 --> 28:07.769
But we've also had a lot of good
conversations.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.854
And I've really enjoyed
getting to know all of you.

28:09.938 --> 28:11.439
I don't know what Aimee
put in this soup,

28:11.523 --> 28:13.149
{\an8}but maybe she put a little
sedative or something in there

28:13.233 --> 28:14.943
{\an8}to make us all happy and get
along with each other.

28:15.026 --> 28:17.028
I feel like I've been with y'all
for, like, a year.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.363
{\an1}I know, it does feel
like it's been a year.

28:18.446 --> 28:19.614
{\an5}(laughing)

28:18.446 --> 28:19.614
{\an1}Yeah.

28:19.697 --> 28:21.491
{\an5}(Kirk)
Me, personally,
I've gone through a lot.

28:21.574 --> 28:22.492
I've lost a lot of friends.

28:22.575 --> 28:23.660
I've been homeless,
I've been broke.

28:23.743 --> 28:24.911
I've been living out
of my truck.

28:24.994 --> 28:27.038
I've been through
a bunch of (bleep).

28:27.122 --> 28:28.915
So, like, petty (bleep),
like, life's too short.

28:28.998 --> 28:30.458
I saw a bunch of (bleep)
growing up, like, it was rough.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.002
My brother got shot.

28:33.086 --> 28:35.547
And we moved to Atlanta
to get away from all that.

28:35.630 --> 28:37.632
And now just the fact
that I'm living here,

28:37.715 --> 28:39.217
it's surreal, honestly.

28:39.300 --> 28:40.593
{\an1}And I'm sorry
for my anger issues.

28:40.677 --> 28:42.429
It's all good.
We all got problems.

28:42.512 --> 28:44.514
A lot of problems.

28:44.597 --> 28:45.807
Uh, where
do I begin?

28:45.890 --> 28:48.643
We got 99 problems
but a thot ain't one.

28:48.726 --> 28:50.478
(laughter)

28:50.562 --> 28:53.648
{\an8}I love to see us come together
during dinnertime

28:53.731 --> 28:55.650
{\an8}and just embrace each other

28:55.733 --> 28:57.318
{\an8}and not have any arguments
or any fights.

28:57.402 --> 29:00.363
{\an1}Does anybody here actually
still live with their family?

29:00.447 --> 29:00.989
Live with
their parents or...

29:01.072 --> 29:01.656
{\an6}I do.

29:01.072 --> 29:01.656
{\an1}I do.

29:01.739 --> 29:02.949
{\an5}You do?

29:01.739 --> 29:02.949
Yeah.

29:03.032 --> 29:06.161
My grandmother is
in hospice right now.

29:06.244 --> 29:07.745
And she's been in hospice
for, like, a year.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.080
{\an4}Oh, no.

29:07.829 --> 29:09.080
I'm sorry to hear that.

29:09.164 --> 29:10.915
So, I'm there
to help out, you know,

29:10.999 --> 29:13.877
{\an5}to get her up
to the bathroom, to get
her back, to get her food,

29:13.960 --> 29:15.795
{\an5}to do this and...

29:13.960 --> 29:15.795
{\an1}Aww...

29:15.879 --> 29:17.672
{\an5}Yeah, I don't--

29:15.879 --> 29:17.672
Codi, you are a sweetheart.

29:17.755 --> 29:21.718
{\an5}(choking up)
I am, but I know sometimes
when I drink that it seems

29:21.801 --> 29:24.596
{\an1}like I'm (bleep) just because
I just, I just bury stuff down,

29:24.679 --> 29:26.431
and I just wanna
just be somebody else.

29:26.514 --> 29:28.099
I wanna be different,
you know?

29:28.183 --> 29:30.393
{\an4}It's just gonna suck
if we go through this summer
hating each other,

29:30.477 --> 29:32.520
{\an1}'cause then we're gonna
waste our summer together.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.022
{\an4}(Kirk)
Yeah, I gotta remember, like,
how blessed we really are.

29:34.105 --> 29:36.399
So, let's enjoy
each other's company.

29:36.483 --> 29:37.692
(Codi)
Thank you for cooking, Aimee.

29:37.775 --> 29:38.693
{\an5}(Aimee)
But I did good
with that, didn't I?

29:38.776 --> 29:40.153
Oh, yeah, you did great.

29:40.236 --> 29:41.696
{\an5}(Gus)
When we come together
and have these dinners,

29:41.779 --> 29:42.864
it does make me reminisce
on the good days

29:42.947 --> 29:44.616
back when I was young
with my family.

29:44.699 --> 29:46.034
Damn, it feels good today.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.203
That's what I'm saying, bro,
I'm about to chill for a second.

29:48.286 --> 29:49.245
(Gus)
It's not the same anymore,

29:49.329 --> 29:50.288
but everybody
coming together tonight

29:50.371 --> 29:52.707
does remind me
of those good days.

29:53.917 --> 29:55.543
{\an1}Hearing you talk at the dinner
table and everything,

29:55.627 --> 29:57.378
{\an1}I can tell we kind of
have the same upbringing.

29:57.462 --> 29:58.963
{\an1}And we kind of been
through the same stuff.

29:59.047 --> 30:00.381
{\an5}I've always
been saying that.

29:59.047 --> 30:00.381
That's why we click.

30:00.465 --> 30:01.090
{\an5}That's why we click.

30:00.465 --> 30:01.090
Yeah, exactly.

30:01.174 --> 30:02.884
We understand each other.

30:02.967 --> 30:04.052
There's a lot of stuff that,
you know, went on in my house

30:04.135 --> 30:06.971
{\an1}in childhood that I haven't
told the whole house.

30:07.055 --> 30:09.224
{\an1}When I was 17, I caught
my mom in an affair.

30:09.307 --> 30:10.725
{\an6}Mm-hmm.

30:09.307 --> 30:10.725
And so, um...

30:10.808 --> 30:13.394
{\an1}obviously, I brought it up
to my dad, and, um...

30:13.478 --> 30:14.229
{\an1}He went and ran off with,
you know,

30:14.312 --> 30:16.147
{\an1}other woman,
you know, instantly.

30:16.231 --> 30:18.733
{\an1}Then I went about two years
without talking to him.

30:18.816 --> 30:20.527
And part of the reason
I'm like the way I am

30:20.610 --> 30:22.320
{\an1}with the girls or whatever,
relationship-wise,

30:22.403 --> 30:23.780
{\an1}is because I saw all
that crap growing up and...

30:23.863 --> 30:26.032
No, it makes sense.
It makes perfect sense.

30:26.115 --> 30:27.700

goes off, you better step back

39:21.692 --> 39:23.611
'cause it's about to be
a volcano erupting.

39:23.694 --> 39:24.612
(Kirk)
Go home!

39:27.031 --> 39:28.074
{\an8}Okay, well,
take her then.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.950
{\an5}Take her then.

39:28.157 --> 39:29.950
Just get her out of here.

39:30.034 --> 39:31.744
{\an1}Take your wife or I'll
knock you the (bleep) out!

39:32.495 --> 39:35.373
Oh, (bleep).
Oh boy.

39:35.456 --> 39:36.707
You don't know me, bruh,
I'm from Atlanta.

39:36.791 --> 39:38.834
{\an5}(bleep)!

39:36.791 --> 39:38.834
Oh, hell no.

39:38.918 --> 39:41.420
No, no! Who the (bleep)
started (bleep)?

39:41.504 --> 39:42.755
Who the (bleep)
is starting (bleep)?

39:42.838 --> 39:43.798
Hold on!
Who the (bleep)--

39:43.881 --> 39:45.633
(overlapping shouting
and bleeps)

39:45.716 --> 39:49.345
{\an8}All right, bitch,
let's (bleep) get it!

39:49.428 --> 39:50.513
(overlapping shouting
and bleeps)

39:53.265 --> 39:55.476
{\an5}(Candace)
Kortni just started
swinging like a wild woman.

39:55.559 --> 39:57.603
I don't even think Kortni
knew who she was fighting.

39:57.686 --> 40:00.481
{\an8}But Kortni just all, "Who we
hitting," and just swinging.

40:00.564 --> 40:01.565
Go, get in the car.
Get in the car.

40:01.649 --> 40:04.235
{\an8}Back the (bleep) off,
(bleep) bitch!

40:04.318 --> 40:07.655
{\an8}I want to (bleep) you up!

40:07.738 --> 40:09.281
{\an8}(bleep) bitch!

40:09.365 --> 40:11.492
Yeah, run this way, ho!
I wanna knock you over!

40:11.575 --> 40:12.827
(overlapping shouting
and bleeps)

40:12.910 --> 40:15.287
{\an5}(Aimee)
Hey, we might get
in our little fights,

40:15.371 --> 40:16.705
but at the end
of the day,

40:16.789 --> 40:21.001
ain't nobody else gonna
touch anybody in this house.

40:21.085 --> 40:22.503
(overlapping shouting)

40:22.586 --> 40:26.549
{\an4}(Kirk)
See? Look, look!
Come on! Come on!

40:28.092 --> 40:29.802
No! (bleep)!

40:29.885 --> 40:32.138
{\an1}Whoo!

40:32.221 --> 40:34.306
{\an5}(Nilsa)
It is crazy--
everyone's fighting,

40:34.390 --> 40:35.850
everyone's pulling each other
off of each other.

40:35.933 --> 40:39.687
Aimee's over here swinging.
Kirk's back there yelling.

40:39.770 --> 40:40.229
{\an8}Gus is pulling
everyone off.

40:40.312 --> 40:42.231
{\an8}Jeremiah...

40:43.607 --> 40:45.442
{\an8}Where's Jeremiah?

40:45.526 --> 40:47.194
{\an7}(overlapping shouting
and bleeps)

40:47.278 --> 40:49.029
{\an8}Get off of my (bleep)!

40:49.113 --> 40:50.406
{\an8}Jeremiah, he's home school.

40:50.489 --> 40:51.574
{\an8}You know, he don't
see hood (bleep) like this.

40:51.657 --> 40:54.243
{\an8}(overlapping shouting
and bleeps)

40:54.952 --> 40:56.662
{\an8}(bleep) the damn security!

40:56.745 --> 40:59.081
{\an8}Aimee, Aimee, Aimee!

40:59.165 --> 41:00.833
{\an8}(man)
Get to the car!

41:00.916 --> 41:04.420
{\an8}Don't (bleep) with
my (bleep) damn security!

41:04.503 --> 41:06.088
{\an8}My purse is over there, Gus.

41:04.503 --> 41:06.088
{\an8}Get in the car.

41:06.172 --> 41:08.591
{\an8}(Gus)
Things just kind of
escalated out of control.

41:08.674 --> 41:10.426
{\an8}We gotta get out of here
before someone gets hurt.

41:10.509 --> 41:11.552
{\an9}Calm down!

41:11.635 --> 41:12.636
{\an8}(overlapping chatter)

41:12.720 --> 41:14.013
{\an8}(siren whooping)

41:14.096 --> 41:15.848
{\an8}(overlapping shouting)

41:21.604 --> 41:22.855
{\an8}(man)
Next time on
"Floribama Shore."

41:22.938 --> 41:25.816
{\an7}I grew up in a house seeing
women get disrespected.

41:25.900 --> 41:29.069
{\an8}So, when you sit here and accuse
me of that, it breaks my heart.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.071
{\an8}Kayla Jo, apparently
she's a witch.

41:31.155 --> 41:34.241
{\an7}Ohh! No!
Where's that Jesus candle?

41:34.325 --> 41:36.744
{\an8}I am going to rebuke this demon
in the name of the Lord.

41:36.827 --> 41:38.078
{\an8}(laughing)
