<i>Izzy was the first
girl I met in,</i>

00:17.218 --> 00:19.084
<i>I mean, years</i>

00:19.086 --> 00:22.321
who was, uh,

00:22.323 --> 00:25.024
insecure enough

00:25.026 --> 00:26.946
to think that I was
right for her.

00:28.362 --> 00:29.561
Who could I possibly
be right for?

00:29.563 --> 00:31.597
I'm a fucking mental patient.

00:33.200 --> 00:36.301
She was insistent that
I-I told her how I felt.

00:36.303 --> 00:39.138
Can you believe that?
Who does that?

00:39.140 --> 00:40.639
<i>I started tallying
up all this stuff</i>

00:40.641 --> 00:42.708
<i>I loved about her.</i>

00:42.710 --> 00:45.778
I mean, shit, dude, she's
my fabric softener.

00:45.780 --> 00:48.614
I don't know, man, she's,
she's kind of sexy in,

00:48.616 --> 00:52.818
like, a really goofy,
Special Olympics way.

00:52.820 --> 00:54.420
<i>I think for the
first time, I was,</i>

00:54.422 --> 00:56.355
I actually met someone
who was more depressed

00:56.357 --> 00:58.690
and neurotic than me.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.360
<i>And that felt really good.</i>

01:03.330 --> 01:04.763
I think I loved that girl.

01:08.269 --> 01:11.804
Look at you, big sister. Now,
get off that herpes bench.

01:11.806 --> 01:14.106
I mean, quickly, I'll
walk you to class

01:14.108 --> 01:15.474
before I go to work, okay?

01:15.476 --> 01:18.544
Come on, take my hand, let's go.

01:18.546 --> 01:20.446
Okay.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.781
Just finish college, okay?

01:22.783 --> 01:25.284
And then why don't you take
the year for yourself?

01:25.286 --> 01:27.152
You're a millennial, you
could try the whole, like,

01:27.154 --> 01:31.223
having-fun-in-your-20s thing.
They're all doing it.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.492
- Except for me.
- Wait. Work?

01:33.494 --> 01:35.227
I thought you were just
here for a fashion thing.

01:35.229 --> 01:36.829
Just a fashion thing?

01:36.831 --> 01:38.597
Oh. Oh, my God, Sabrina,
can I get a pic?

01:38.599 --> 01:41.400
- Yeah.
- Thank you.

01:41.402 --> 01:42.701
It's a three-week
long <i>Vogue</i> shoot

01:42.703 --> 01:43.769
that involves a giraffe,

01:43.771 --> 01:45.671
an insanely famous actor,

01:45.673 --> 01:48.774
and a car bomb, any of
which could kill me.

01:48.776 --> 01:50.576
Just be safe.

01:50.578 --> 01:52.311
Dude, I am, I'm doing my best

01:52.313 --> 01:55.314
to not die in a car
accident like dad, okay?

01:55.316 --> 01:57.249
Yeah. Yeah, right.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.386
Why are you always so
involved in that thing?

02:01.388 --> 02:03.655
You're clutching it like
it's, like, an infant.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.391
Oh, I don't know, just
writing and reading,

02:06.393 --> 02:07.659
reading, writing, writing.

02:07.661 --> 02:10.262
- Sorry, it's a habit.
- You're weird.

02:12.266 --> 02:14.766
Iz. Iz.

02:17.638 --> 02:20.572
I know that we've had a rough
go these past few years, okay?

02:21.909 --> 02:24.710
But I go to therapy
and shit, you know?

02:24.712 --> 02:26.578
You never even cried about dad.

02:26.580 --> 02:28.747
I don't want to get upset,
I just want to move on

02:28.749 --> 02:30.549
and find the thing.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.551
What thing?

02:32.553 --> 02:35.654
The thing that makes
me feel better.

02:36.624 --> 02:38.223
I know you're trying.

02:40.427 --> 02:41.827
What is that?

02:42.796 --> 02:44.263
It's a salad.

02:44.265 --> 02:46.832
There's a whole
cucumber in that.

02:46.834 --> 02:50.669
But it's also a juice.
It's a salad juice.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.271
Those are separate things.

02:52.273 --> 02:55.874
We live in a modern world, Izzy.
Jesus.

02:55.876 --> 02:58.744
- Do you wanna try it?
- No, I don't want...

02:58.746 --> 02:59.778
No.

02:59.780 --> 03:03.215
Ugh, you're impossible. Ow.

03:03.217 --> 03:04.683
I'd like to remind you
all that my production

03:04.685 --> 03:06.752
of <i> The Mouse And The Minotaur,</i>

03:06.754 --> 03:09.955
which I directed and co-wrote,
is opening this Saturday

03:09.957 --> 03:12.691
right here in the theater.
Please support the arts.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.693
If you don't,
you're getting a D.

03:14.695 --> 03:16.261
Have a great weekend.

03:16.263 --> 03:18.564
Izzy, may I speak
to you, please?

03:20.601 --> 03:22.668
Uh, just leave that, I'll...

03:24.939 --> 03:28.340
- I'm sorry, that... Hi.
- Hi.

03:28.342 --> 03:31.476
I need to talk to you a little
bit about some class stuff.

03:31.478 --> 03:32.911
Right, okay.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.347
You've gotta do,
like, one thing,

03:35.349 --> 03:38.483
but if you don't pass my
class, you don't graduate.

03:38.485 --> 03:40.786
- You're right.
- Then here we go.

03:40.788 --> 03:42.955
<i>Midsummer Night's Dream.</i>

03:42.957 --> 03:44.990
- Um, you know what?
- Yes. No, right here.

03:44.992 --> 03:46.792
Is there a world in which...

03:46.794 --> 03:49.461
No, there is, like, not a world.
Take it.

03:49.463 --> 03:51.330
Shakespeare?

03:51.332 --> 03:53.532
Ross, please.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.803
Now, Ross Wyatt, Izzy Klein.

03:57.805 --> 04:01.406
Uh, Ross is minoring in theater
and you're majoring in?

04:01.408 --> 04:03.709
Molecular biophysics
and biochemistry.

04:03.711 --> 04:07.579
I thought it would be great
if you guys do the scene

04:07.581 --> 04:11.350
where Titania has fallen
in love with Bottom.

04:11.352 --> 04:12.751
- Oh.
- The donkey.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.454
Actually, the girl
kisses him at the end.

04:15.456 --> 04:16.788
If you guys could
have it on its feet

04:16.790 --> 04:18.290
in the next couple of weeks...

04:18.291 --> 04:20.291
Excuse me. Belinda?

04:23.397 --> 04:25.564
What... Oh, number?

04:25.566 --> 04:27.633
- Izzy, right?
- Yeah.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.936
It's gonna be a real challenge,

04:30.938 --> 04:31.970
but I'm looking
forward to exploring

04:31.972 --> 04:33.739
this opportunity with you.

less cheesy zone in here.

06:08.369 --> 06:09.768
Fingers crossed.

06:09.770 --> 06:12.838
Hey, I'm thinking
about going to LA.

06:12.840 --> 06:15.073
Wait, you're not, like, you're
not, like, trying to go

06:15.075 --> 06:17.476
for the whole summer or
something weird, right?

06:17.478 --> 06:21.813
I was actually thinkin',
um, maybe to, like, live.

06:21.815 --> 06:23.148
You live in New York.

06:23.150 --> 06:26.551
You live here, you live
in my apartment with me.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.855
Y-yeah.

06:29.857 --> 06:34.426
- Um, I kind of have to go back.
- Pack up your shit.

06:34.428 --> 06:37.896
- Whoa. Wait, what?
- You said you want to move back.

06:37.898 --> 06:40.732
That's the beginning of a
conversation about this.

06:40.734 --> 06:43.802
- I mean, you could come with me.
- Oh, Jesus-fucking-Christ.

06:43.804 --> 06:47.973
Okay, or, no, then, then
we can do long distance

06:47.975 --> 06:49.975
and FaceTime, I mean,
I can, I can send you

06:49.977 --> 06:52.010
those fruit-bouquet things with
the pineapple on a stick...

06:52.012 --> 06:54.045
Pineapple? What are you...
This is not...

06:54.047 --> 06:56.047
We're ta... We're not
talking about pineapple.

06:56.049 --> 06:58.617
- Have you been planning this?
- You know I just can't plan.

06:58.619 --> 07:02.087
- I ran out of cash.
- Get a job.

07:02.089 --> 07:05.424
That is what a normal
person would do,

07:05.426 --> 07:07.759
but you're talking to
me about pineapples!

07:07.761 --> 07:10.595
How did I even fucking
do this for three years?

07:10.597 --> 07:13.698
You and your phases,
Brazilian drumming

07:13.700 --> 07:16.668
or this, I-I made a salad once.

07:16.670 --> 07:20.539
Your fucking ceramics
which are tragic.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.541
- That's rude.
- So what's this phase?

07:22.543 --> 07:24.509
This is the, uh, this is...

07:24.511 --> 07:25.844
Okay, you're taking
acting classes,

07:25.846 --> 07:27.612

07:31.485 --> 07:33.718
- I made salad twice.
- Whatever, I, I...

07:33.720 --> 07:36.188
- Twice I made salad, Aaron!
- I knew this was gonna happen.

07:36.190 --> 07:38.790
I knew you were gonna leave,
it's just like the band.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.759
It's no... It's the same shit.

07:40.761 --> 07:45.597
It's not the same shit. I'm
not leaving you on purpose.

07:45.599 --> 07:48.200
I still think we
can work this out.

07:51.839 --> 07:54.239
You need therapy!

07:55.876 --> 07:58.510
You mean, couple's therapy?

09:13.720 --> 09:16.588
How do you feel about getting
your third wheel back?

09:16.590 --> 09:19.224
- Just like old times.
- Oh, I'm honored, I can't wait.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.126
Hey, Sebastian, they're
ready for you.

09:21.128 --> 09:23.595
Yeah, yeah, okay,
okay, five minutes.

09:23.597 --> 09:25.564
Sorry, I gotta go, this AD is
bugging the shit out of me.

09:27.634 --> 09:31.303
Oh... Thank God you're
still in New York.

crash at your hotel.

happened last night.

09:35.576 --> 09:39.811
Um... I think it's over.

09:39.813 --> 09:42.147
You can never trust a guy who
has 20 of the same shirt

09:42.149 --> 09:45.350
in the same color.
It's not natural.

09:45.352 --> 09:48.086
- That's not okay.
- It's not.

09:48.088 --> 09:50.121
I want you to know,
Sebastian and I

09:50.123 --> 09:52.691
are absolutely stoked you're
coming to stay with us in LA.

09:52.693 --> 09:55.260
As long as you do your dishes,

09:55.262 --> 09:57.896
and you remember to flush the
toilet when you take a poo.

09:57.898 --> 09:59.631
- What? I flush.
- Like...

09:59.633 --> 10:01.366
California's not in
that much of a drought.

10:01.368 --> 10:03.301
Once again, to clarify,
I definitely do flush

10:03.303 --> 10:05.370
when I poo, Sabrina.

10:05.372 --> 10:07.038
I love you so much.

I'm sorry.

10:11.645 --> 10:13.111
Have a good one.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.749
This is disgusting by the
way, what you've done here.

10:17.751 --> 10:20.885

stick with anything.

10:45.879 --> 10:49.247
I-I-I'm amazed that we were
together that long, you know?

10:49.249 --> 10:52.183
Yeah, I know, I hope she
fucking moves on or whatever.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.952
But look, my career
is blowing up.

10:53.954 --> 10:55.787
I don't have time for this shit.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.922
Yeah, yeah, no, no, I
can't make the gig.

10:57.924 --> 11:01.092
I got, like, a stomach thing.
No, it's fucked me up.

11:08.869 --> 11:10.268
Hey, how was the <i> Vogue</i> shoot?

11:10.270 --> 11:12.704
Oh, my God, please
tell me you got me

11:12.706 --> 11:16.708
what I wanted and not some
tree-bark peel-off dirt shit?

11:18.311 --> 11:21.012
Holler! Thank you.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.848
Oh, how was the, the giraffe?

11:23.850 --> 11:27.452
He was being really
difficult today, actually.

11:27.454 --> 11:30.155
Hm. Are you gonna leave
all that on or...

11:30.157 --> 11:33.024
I wanted to eat my
greens in character.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.259
Oh.

11:36.997 --> 11:39.097
I walked by Aaron's
on my way here.

11:39.099 --> 11:40.832
How many times did you
call me and you were like,

11:40.834 --> 11:43.835
"He's a lunatic?"
He is a lunatic.

11:43.837 --> 11:46.404
I'm doing, um, a scene with a
really hot new guy from class.

11:46.406 --> 11:48.173
When I said there were
other fishies in the sea,

11:48.175 --> 11:49.774
I meant, like, look through
the sea, not immediately

11:49.776 --> 11:52.310
at the first person
that shows up.

11:52.312 --> 11:54.913
All I said was that he's
good looking, that's it.

11:54.915 --> 11:57.315
Don't do it, Izzy.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.451
- All I...
- Don't.

11:59.453 --> 12:01.352
- That's...
- Do...

12:01.354 --> 12:03.054
- Sab...
- It...

12:05.726 --> 12:07.792
It's like, don't do it at all.

12:12.165 --> 12:15.333
Hey, scene partner. Come on in.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.735
Okay.

12:17.971 --> 12:21.172
Wow, the view is incredible.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.974
Thank you.

12:23.877 --> 12:25.276
Oh, you mean that.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.782
Um, so, you know, I thought
that we could start

12:30.784 --> 12:32.784
by, by just, like,
reading it through.

12:32.786 --> 12:34.452
- A few times.
- Yeah, good.

12:34.454 --> 12:36.287
Or we can just jump right
in and start rehearsing.

12:36.289 --> 12:38.056
- Great.
- Yeah.

12:38.058 --> 12:40.158
- Where are we?
- Um...

12:40.160 --> 12:43.828
God, I want to say
it's, like, act four.

12:43.830 --> 12:47.799
Wow, that's a bold, bold move.

12:50.871 --> 12:54.005
Acting without
relaxation is chaos

12:54.007 --> 12:56.875
and this is an exceptionally
chill strain of indica.

12:57.778 --> 12:59.511
It'll help us go deeper.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.090
- Mm-hmm.
- Oh.

13:13.326 --> 13:15.794
- Hi. Hey, good morning.
- Hi.

13:15.796 --> 13:18.396
Good morning.

13:18.398 --> 13:22.801
You know, lots of girls tell
me I'm an exceptional cuddler.

13:25.839 --> 13:27.372
For sure.

13:27.374 --> 13:31.442
Um, okay. That's, um...

13:43.089 --> 13:45.390
Izzy, what's the rush?

13:45.392 --> 13:48.226
Stay for a cappuccino
and a biscotta.

13:48.228 --> 13:52.463
I have class, so...

13:52.465 --> 13:55.099
- Hey.
- Ah. Whoo.

13:55.101 --> 13:59.470
Really, really great work last night.
Seriously.

14:01.942 --> 14:03.408
Oh, it's...

14:10.584 --> 14:13.852
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

14:17.224 --> 14:19.958
- So?
- Whoa!

14:19.960 --> 14:23.161
- Car-bomb photo shoot.
- Oh.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.629
- Aaron-related offense?
- No.

14:24.631 --> 14:26.331
But I got rubbed up on
by a Ken-doll boner

14:26.333 --> 14:29.934
and then offered an
Italian coffee drink.

14:29.936 --> 14:31.269
Are you okay?

14:31.271 --> 14:33.571
You're asking me that right now?

14:33.573 --> 14:36.140
It's avant-garde, but I like it.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.945
Ma with the exclamation points.

14:40.947 --> 14:44.983
- What's she saying? Can I see?
- Sabrina, stop.

14:44.985 --> 14:47.051
- Dude.
- Sabrina!

14:49.189 --> 14:51.489
Oh, that's just lush.

14:51.491 --> 14:53.925
What, that mom's dating a woman?

14:53.927 --> 14:56.361
No, it's that she's dating
Britney's stand-in.

14:56.363 --> 14:57.528
From the Mickey Mouse Club.

14:57.530 --> 15:01.032
- No, no, no, no, no!
- What?

15:01.034 --> 15:02.901
Aaron's gonna throw
away my ceramics. Ugh.

15:02.903 --> 15:05.336
Where are you going? How can
you be so casual about this?

15:05.338 --> 15:08.139
- What, about mom?
- This is, like, so weird to me.

15:08.141 --> 15:11.209
You're really weird about
everybody mom dates.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.243
Not ev-everyone.

15:12.245 --> 15:13.978
Honestly, if dad was alive,

15:13.980 --> 15:16.114
he probably would've
thought it was hot.

15:16.116 --> 15:18.616
- I said it. I gotta go.
- Izzy, no, don't go.

15:25.425 --> 15:27.992
- Hi.
- Those.

15:27.994 --> 15:30.194
Oh, okay, cool.

15:30.196 --> 15:34.666
Hey, um, we're not
together anymore, right?

15:34.668 --> 15:36.367
It's just that you never
actually said, like,

15:36.369 --> 15:38.703
"We're breaking up,"
or "This is over."

15:38.705 --> 15:40.138
So I just want to make sure

15:40.140 --> 15:43.408
that you're not
still my boyfriend.

15:46.279 --> 15:51.049
You know, you know what's
always, uh, pissed me off?

15:51.051 --> 15:53.151
It's that.

15:53.153 --> 15:57.255
No one should love that
show as much as you do.

15:57.257 --> 16:00.525
And I just realized that
I feel the same way

16:00.527 --> 16:04.329
about you as I do this poster,

16:04.331 --> 16:07.365
which is that I'm sick
of looking at it.

16:07.367 --> 16:11.069
I am not your boyfriend.

16:11.071 --> 16:13.104
Yeah, despite what
you might think,

16:13.106 --> 16:15.006
that was rude, by the way.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.642
I'm not hurt that you want
to get rid of my poster,

16:17.644 --> 16:20.078
but those, I left
here for a reason.

16:20.080 --> 16:22.046
Why would I keep anything
here that reminds me of you?

16:22.048 --> 16:23.514
Because I thought that
eventually you could

16:23.516 --> 16:25.383
look at them and think
about us in a good way.

16:25.385 --> 16:27.452
I just want you to get
rid of this stuff.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.187
I don't wanna stare
at it anymore.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.655
Well, you could've
just sent them to me.

16:30.657 --> 16:32.724
Oh, wow. Wow.

16:32.726 --> 16:34.125
- Wow, what? What?
- You...

16:34.127 --> 16:37.195
You have some nerve to leave me

16:37.197 --> 16:39.263
and then waltz back in here

16:39.265 --> 16:42.333
and insinuate that
this is about sex.

16:42.335 --> 16:44.035
- No, I...
- I don't need you, Izzy.

16:44.037 --> 16:46.070
I don't, I-I've been
with plenty of girls

16:46.072 --> 16:47.605
in the last couple of
weeks, it's not a big deal.

16:47.607 --> 16:49.240
And you know what?
It's even better.

16:49.242 --> 16:50.708
Because they don't stay over.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.778
What does that mean,
like, you never slept

16:53.780 --> 16:55.780
when I was here? I lived here.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.448
You don't actually
ever leave the house,

16:57.450 --> 17:00.284
so you must have been
really tired, you psycho!

17:00.286 --> 17:01.786
You're the fucking psycho, okay?

17:01.788 --> 17:03.187
- Why am I the psycho?
- Who, who...

17:03.189 --> 17:04.622
Because who has a
top-sheet phobia?

17:04.624 --> 17:06.124
- I have a top-sheet phobia.
- Who?

17:06.126 --> 17:07.458
Besides you, name one
person who has...

17:07.460 --> 17:09.493
I do! I feel like
they're strangling me!

17:09.496 --> 17:11.229
- That's insane!
- That's not insane!

17:11.231 --> 17:12.797
- It is insane.
- Insane?

17:12.799 --> 17:16.300
That's insane! You're the
Rain Man of T-shirts!

17:16.301 --> 17:19.337
There's like 900 million
T-shirts right there.

17:19.339 --> 17:21.039
You're insane!

17:25.377 --> 17:27.545
You know what? No, no,
no, we shouldn't.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.615
- Yeah, we should.
- No, no. Stop it!

17:34.320 --> 17:35.686
Stop it!

17:37.157 --> 17:38.623
We really shouldn't,
we're not together.

17:38.625 --> 17:40.124
You just said you're not my
boyfriend, we shouldn't...

17:40.126 --> 17:41.492
- Shut up. Shut up!
- What?

17:41.494 --> 17:43.261
Don't you wanna see
it one more time?

17:43.263 --> 17:44.495
- What?
- You wanna see it one more time?

17:44.497 --> 17:47.098
- Who says that?
- I do.

17:47.100 --> 17:48.199
Yes!

18:05.552 --> 18:07.418
Fuck.

18:11.591 --> 18:13.157

18:14.427 --> 18:16.194

18:16.196 --> 18:18.763
I hate you. Ah!

18:18.765 --> 18:21.165
I hate you so much.
I hate you so...

18:32.545 --> 18:34.245
That's it, right?

18:35.582 --> 18:36.848

22:35.488 --> 22:36.887
Hey, wait, who was Ross?

22:36.889 --> 22:39.056
He's the, the theater guy.

22:39.058 --> 22:40.858
Huh, but you didn't
sleep with him?

22:40.860 --> 22:42.560
- No, no, no, no.
- Yes or no?

22:42.562 --> 22:43.961
You sleep with him or you
didn't sleep with him?

22:43.963 --> 22:46.030
- No, I slept with Aaron.
- So it was Aaron.

22:46.032 --> 22:47.732
- Yeast infection.
- You got a yeasty?

22:47.734 --> 22:49.734
From having sex with him
for, like, six mins?

22:49.736 --> 22:51.869
- Such a bad one, too.
- Sorry, sir.

22:51.871 --> 22:54.705
That is God striking you down.

22:54.707 --> 22:56.907
I don't know, false promise
is also a contender.

22:56.909 --> 22:58.576
You know, it's a
really good thing

22:58.578 --> 23:00.778
that you're not actually
crushing on this Ross character

23:00.780 --> 23:04.081
because if I Irish goodbye
just to blow chunks

23:04.083 --> 23:05.583
outside of his apartment door,

23:05.585 --> 23:07.718
I'd be hiding under
a rock right now.

23:09.455 --> 23:11.689
- Yeah.
- No.

23:11.691 --> 23:14.792
Izzy, don't tell me, you are actually?
Izzy, come on.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.827
What, he leads you in a
totally heartless way

23:16.829 --> 23:19.029
and is shallower
than a kiddie pool.

23:19.031 --> 23:21.866
You're post-break up,
you're pre-real world.

23:21.868 --> 23:24.969
Save a little face while
you still have some.

23:24.971 --> 23:29.507
That's, uh... harsh, Sabrina.

23:29.509 --> 23:31.075
I'll tell you what's
even harsher.

23:31.077 --> 23:33.544
One, you're not staying here
for my college graduation

23:33.546 --> 23:37.782
because you are...
mean-spirited.

23:37.784 --> 23:39.417
No, it's 'cause I
don't wanna see mom

23:39.419 --> 23:40.651
and her adorable child bride...

23:40.653 --> 23:42.086
- That's not even, like, a thing.
- Two.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.854
I don't think you remember
that I have a boyfriend

23:43.856 --> 23:45.189
at home whose show
just went on hiatus

23:45.191 --> 23:46.824
and if I leave him
alone for too long,

23:46.826 --> 23:48.125
he starts heating up his takeout

23:48.127 --> 23:50.127
by leaning it
against a radiator.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.163
- No.
- Yeah.

23:53.199 --> 23:55.599
Oh, oh, and this stuff,

23:55.601 --> 23:56.901
this stuff right here...

23:57.970 --> 24:00.104
is literally made of crackers.

24:00.106 --> 24:03.040
I'm gonna itch my
vagina off of my body.

24:05.211 --> 24:07.011
- Give me your hands.
- Uh-uh, not again.

24:07.013 --> 24:08.679
- We've talked about this.
- I really don't wanna do this.

24:08.681 --> 24:10.181
There's nothing on the box.

24:10.183 --> 24:12.183
If you can imagine, people
come to this specific spot

24:12.185 --> 24:14.885
they put their, their stranger
vagina hands all over these...

24:14.887 --> 24:17.154
Stop, there's no
vagina on my box!

24:17.156 --> 24:19.790
Vagina in your thumb,
vagina in your fingernail.

24:19.792 --> 24:23.928
We received a glowing
review from you, professor.

24:23.930 --> 24:28.199
Uh, it says here I'm
miscast as donkey. No...

24:30.636 --> 24:32.136
No chemistry with scene partner.

24:33.906 --> 24:35.906
I'm assuming the scene
went badly, then?

24:35.908 --> 24:37.641
It was...

24:37.643 --> 24:40.611
I blacked out, that's what happened.
I blacked out.

24:44.750 --> 24:46.617
Do you think the teacher's
gonna pass you?

24:46.619 --> 24:48.219
I mean, I walked in
on him making out

24:48.221 --> 24:51.522
with one of his students,
aptly named Belinda Hooker,

24:51.524 --> 24:53.524
in the utility closet last week.

24:53.526 --> 24:56.694
So, yeah, I mean, I
think he will pass me.

24:56.696 --> 24:58.095
If you're gonna go
to LA and do this,

24:58.097 --> 24:59.730
you've to start taking the
work seriously, like,

24:59.732 --> 25:01.932
you're not always gonna
have Belinda Hooker

25:01.934 --> 25:03.200
to fall back on.

25:03.202 --> 25:05.669
I don't know what I wanna do,

25:05.671 --> 25:08.539
I don't know why I'm going home,

25:08.541 --> 25:10.774
I don't know anything, so...

25:10.776 --> 25:11.976
Well, maybe you need
to take a moment

25:11.978 --> 25:13.898
to think about
that type of shit.

25:16.849 --> 25:18.549
Did you learn that in your
sensitivity training course,

25:18.551 --> 25:21.051
Sabrina, or...

25:23.222 --> 25:25.923
My car's here.

25:25.925 --> 25:28.692
I suggest that you shove
a t-pon up there quick.

25:28.694 --> 25:31.695
All right? Have a
good graduation.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.297
- Bye.
- I love you.

25:33.299 --> 25:34.932
- Say hi to mom.
- Have a safe flight.

25:34.934 --> 25:36.800
- Say bye!
- Bye.

25:36.802 --> 25:38.102
Thank you.

25:43.743 --> 25:46.210
Oh, my God, look at
this piece of shit.

25:48.648 --> 25:50.948
It's so amazing, I'm-I'm just...

25:53.019 --> 25:55.719
- Hi.
- Oh, Isabel Klein.

25:55.721 --> 25:58.856
- Mmm.
- Oh, my moon and my stars.

25:58.858 --> 26:01.825
- You're a college graduate.
- Daw, it's so true, though.

26:01.827 --> 26:05.062
- Check it out.
- Oh, look at this.

26:05.064 --> 26:08.332
- Ah. A Bachelor of Arts.
- Yeah.

26:08.334 --> 26:11.135
- Wow, this costs...
- Yeah.

26:11.137 --> 26:12.870
- Wow.
- Yeah.

26:12.872 --> 26:15.005
You know, honey, I could
feel your father's spirit

26:15.007 --> 26:16.774
with us during the
whole ceremony

26:16.776 --> 26:19.209
and I could tell
that he is so proud.

26:19.211 --> 26:21.679
So proud.

26:21.681 --> 26:23.747
Of course, he would have rather
you graduated from Yale,

26:23.749 --> 26:25.082
but this is okay.

26:25.084 --> 26:26.917
Thanks, mom. Uh,
where's Amythyst?

26:26.919 --> 26:30.020
Oh, she had to run uptown to
the International Yoga Center

26:30.022 --> 26:32.756
to get some Bodhi-yaya
wind chimes in F sharp.

26:32.758 --> 26:34.291
They're very, very special.

26:34.293 --> 26:35.893
But she's gonna
join us for vegan.

26:35.895 --> 26:38.596
What? No, mom, vegan,
please, just no.

26:38.598 --> 26:40.631
Honey, honey, honey,
honey, Sabrina told me

26:40.633 --> 26:41.832
you had waffles for
dinner the other night.

26:41.834 --> 26:43.300
Why are you, you and Sabrina

26:43.302 --> 26:44.835
have conversations
about my diet?

26:44.837 --> 26:46.270
It's a concern of the family's.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.872
You know, maybe you should
just let the vegan go.

26:48.874 --> 26:51.842
Please, don't do this
to me, that's not...

26:51.844 --> 26:53.644
- Hey, honey.
- Oh, hi.

26:53.646 --> 26:55.245
- You got the chimes?
- Hey.

26:55.247 --> 26:56.947
- Hi, how are you?
- Hi.

26:56.949 --> 26:59.216
- So nice to finally meet you.
- Oh, my God, yeah.

26:59.218 --> 27:00.784
Ah, let's go in, let's go in.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.286
Your graduation
was so beautiful.

27:02.288 --> 27:04.054
Thank you so much.

27:04.056 --> 27:06.056
- Oh.
- I love this place.

27:06.058 --> 27:07.358
I know. It's my favorite.

27:07.360 --> 27:08.926
Oh, you know what,

27:08.928 --> 27:10.995
they have the most amazing

27:10.997 --> 27:12.930
beet-zucchini quinoa salad.

27:12.932 --> 27:14.665
- Do you wanna split that?
- Ooh, yeah, let's do it.

27:14.667 --> 27:16.867
- Okay.
- What is quinoa?

27:16.869 --> 27:18.235
You ladies ready to order?

27:18.237 --> 27:20.671
Hi, can I have, like, a coffee?

27:20.673 --> 27:23.240
- With six sugars?
- Okay.

27:23.242 --> 27:25.209
We'll have a pot of
matcha warrior, no stems.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.777
- All right.
- Thank you very much.

27:26.779 --> 27:27.811
You're welcome. Be right back.

27:27.813 --> 27:29.246
I hear that, uh,

27:29.248 --> 27:32.082
you broke up with Aaron.

27:32.084 --> 27:33.384
I'm really sorry to
hear about that.

27:33.386 --> 27:34.818
I wish you would
have told me sooner.

27:34.820 --> 27:38.856
I did. I left you,
like, 74 voicemails.

27:38.858 --> 27:40.124
- No.
- Oh, Deb.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.659
You do kind of go off the grid.

27:41.661 --> 27:43.794
- When you're on retreats.
- I know.

27:43.796 --> 27:45.295
Mom, how can that
be more important

27:45.297 --> 27:49.166
than the quarter-life crisis
I'm in the middle of?

27:49.168 --> 27:50.334
Seriously, I mean,
you're her girlfriend

27:50.336 --> 27:52.302
for, uh, what, a year, right?

27:52.304 --> 27:55.005
Can you do me a solid here
and alert her to shit, like,

27:55.007 --> 27:57.341
her child is clearly suffering?

27:57.343 --> 28:01.011
- We're not girlfriends, honey.
- We're soul walkers.

28:01.013 --> 28:03.113
We're not defined by
societal conventions,

28:03.115 --> 28:05.182
we're not in anything.

28:05.184 --> 28:07.017
We're on a journey.

28:07.019 --> 28:09.286
We are, I love it.

28:10.956 --> 28:12.456
I don't think I'll understand
anything you just said

28:12.458 --> 28:14.692
until I'm, like,
past enlightenment.

28:14.694 --> 28:17.961
Oh, so I hear you're moving back
to LA to live with your sister.

28:17.963 --> 28:19.329
Yup, just go in right
for the jugular.

28:19.331 --> 28:21.165
Look, mom, moving back
home after college

28:21.167 --> 28:24.968
is a totally legitimate
rite of passage.

28:24.970 --> 28:26.970
Like, wearing a choker
made from old tights.

28:26.972 --> 28:29.973
- I totally did that.
- Or owning a Furby backpack.

28:29.975 --> 28:31.275
Did you have the old black one

28:31.277 --> 28:33.043
or the spotted one
with the pink beak?

28:33.045 --> 28:34.244
I had the old black one.

28:34.246 --> 28:36.747
Too nostalgic.

28:36.749 --> 28:40.050
Yeah, I know, they were radical.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.785
Honey, I know you just graduated

28:41.787 --> 28:45.956
and life might seem a bit,
you know, overwhelming.

28:45.958 --> 28:48.092
And you've always been
a little bit confused

28:48.094 --> 28:51.795
about your purpose. The
ceramics were a low point.

28:51.797 --> 28:54.398
But no one's path
is a straight line.

28:54.400 --> 28:56.433
It's more like a squiggle.

29:01.107 --> 29:03.474
Yes. Okay.

29:05.511 --> 29:08.312
- Hi, uh, JFK?
- Hey, hi.

29:08.314 --> 29:10.034
Yeah. Good.

29:14.186 --> 29:17.221
<i>♪ Here's the thing

29:27.066 --> 29:29.199
No, no, no, no, I'm not
giving you anything today.

29:29.201 --> 29:31.168
Hi, Izzy. Go away, guys.

29:31.170 --> 29:33.170
Oh, come on, Sabrina,
we're your buds.

29:33.172 --> 29:35.272
We know you have somebody in there.
Who is it?

29:35.274 --> 29:37.241
Yeah, yeah, is it
Zac or Sebastian?

29:37.243 --> 29:39.176
It's Sunday.

29:39.178 --> 29:42.146
We agreed we wouldn't
do this on Sundays.

29:42.148 --> 29:43.881
Right, right, guys, she's right.

29:43.883 --> 29:46.150
- Sorry.
- Sorry, sorry, come on.

29:46.152 --> 29:49.419
Just sayin', we're just sayin'.
That's the sister.

29:49.421 --> 29:51.221
- Are you the sister?
- Hey!

29:51.223 --> 29:52.422
- Are you someone?
- Hey, guys.

29:52.424 --> 29:54.324
- Hello?
- We made an agreement.

29:54.326 --> 29:55.392
- Smile.
- Pack it up.

29:55.394 --> 29:56.560
Did you, did you not help her

29:56.562 --> 29:58.028
with her bags?

29:58.030 --> 30:00.497
- I got it.
- Hi. Oh.

30:00.499 --> 30:03.233
- Jeez, how you doing?
- How are you?

30:03.235 --> 30:05.102
So sorry I didn't pick
you up at the airport.

30:05.104 --> 30:06.503
- That's okay.
- Work is crazy.

30:06.505 --> 30:08.005
- That's fine.
- I'm glad you're here, though.

30:08.007 --> 30:09.173
You're just glad I'm
here 'cause you know

30:09.175 --> 30:10.474
I'll buy you alcohol.

30:10.476 --> 30:13.277
Oh, my God, I'm no rogue, okay?

30:13.279 --> 30:15.546
I'm genuinely happy
that you're here,

30:15.548 --> 30:17.047
but if you got me
a six-pack of IPA

30:17.049 --> 30:19.049
at the end of the
day, even better.

30:19.051 --> 30:20.117
I see you.

30:20.119 --> 30:21.218
- Did you see...
- Hi, Izzy!

30:21.220 --> 30:22.853
- Hi.
- Hi.

30:22.855 --> 30:24.555
Whoa, this bitch has
gone full Martha Stew.

30:24.557 --> 30:26.190
She's churning her
own butter now.

30:26.192 --> 30:28.258
- Really?
- Yeah.

30:32.198 --> 30:34.965
Um, hey, when can I move into
the downstairs, by the way?

30:34.967 --> 30:37.100
Oh, no, I forgot to tell you.

30:37.102 --> 30:39.503
Um, we've been on
location so much

30:39.505 --> 30:42.039
that we started renting it out.
Sorry.

30:42.041 --> 30:43.440
And just so you know,
we're keeping you up here

30:43.442 --> 30:45.509
for your own safety,
those rapscallion PFFs

30:45.511 --> 30:47.010
are relentless.

30:47.012 --> 30:50.047
Tell me you mean paparazzi
friends forever?

30:50.049 --> 30:51.615
Guys, come on, sit
down, the food's hot.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.550
And for the record,
that is not my fault,

30:53.552 --> 30:55.419
that situation, okay?

30:55.421 --> 30:57.487
TMZ came up with this story

30:57.489 --> 30:59.489
that I was cheating on
Sebastian with Zac Efron

30:59.491 --> 31:01.024
when we were shooting
<i>Crazy Youth.</i>

31:01.026 --> 31:02.359
And because the movie's
about to come out,

31:02.361 --> 31:06.964
they want me to vaguely
perpetuate it.

31:06.966 --> 31:08.632
I guess it could be worse,
he's a really nice guy.

31:08.634 --> 31:12.369
But what else am I supposed to do?
Sorry.

31:12.371 --> 31:15.138
- They're more like super fans.
- See what I have to put up with?

31:15.140 --> 31:16.540
Mwah.

31:18.344 --> 31:20.110
Butter?

31:20.112 --> 31:21.411
Um, yeah.

31:25.451 --> 31:29.052
The depression has set
in hard, I see. One.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.088
I'm confused about my purpose.

31:31.090 --> 31:33.257
Three. Iz?

31:33.259 --> 31:35.058
You have to do something in life

31:35.060 --> 31:36.393
more useful with your time.

31:36.395 --> 31:39.463
- My path is a squiggle.
- Oh, God.

31:42.635 --> 31:46.637
This isn't a suicide suggestion,

31:46.639 --> 31:48.639
just open up a fucking box.

32:06.058 --> 32:08.558
She ruined everything, um,
she ruined everything.

32:11.063 --> 32:13.497
I can't even sleep with a
fucking top sheet anymore.

32:16.402 --> 32:18.135
<i>You know, sometimes,
I don't know,</i>

32:18.137 --> 32:20.470
<i>we'd sit there, and watch TV</i>

32:20.472 --> 32:22.272
<i>and, you know, eat popcorn,</i>

32:22.274 --> 32:25.642
and just, like, be a couple.

32:25.644 --> 32:28.478
And I, in, in those
moments, I-I loved her.

32:32.017 --> 32:33.684
I think I did.

32:38.157 --> 32:40.524
She was, uh, almost animal.

32:40.526 --> 32:42.192
And every time she
would come around,

32:42.194 --> 32:44.461
<i>I just, I just wanted
to, like, help her out</i>

32:44.463 --> 32:48.365
and say, "What are you doing right now?
Who are you?"

32:48.367 --> 32:49.599
Too much.

32:51.503 --> 32:53.337
What was her name?

32:53.339 --> 32:55.372
I... Izzy, yeah.

32:56.342 --> 32:58.442
Izzy, yeah.

32:58.444 --> 33:00.110
She was, uh...

33:01.313 --> 33:03.193
She was always
eating those M&Ms.

33:07.519 --> 33:09.319
- Season six, episode three.
- No.

33:09.321 --> 33:11.088
Yes, at the end of episode three

33:11.090 --> 33:12.589
on season six of the <i> X-files,</i>

33:12.591 --> 33:16.026
Mulder finally tells Scully

33:16.028 --> 33:18.996
that he loves her.

33:18.998 --> 33:20.364
But she doesn't hear him.

33:20.366 --> 33:21.631
Well, maybe she does hear him,

33:21.633 --> 33:23.066
but, you know, she
doesn't absorb it

33:23.068 --> 33:25.602
or take it seriously
or something.

33:25.604 --> 33:28.071
I-it just, it's-it's got
me thinking how many times

33:28.073 --> 33:29.272
does that happen in
a person's life,

33:29.274 --> 33:31.008
that you don't see
what's directly

33:31.010 --> 33:34.144
in front of you, that
you don't hear people.

33:34.146 --> 33:35.412
I don't know.

33:37.249 --> 33:41.585
I guess I'm just wondering how
you ever meet the right person.

33:41.587 --> 33:44.654
Maybe it's just luck.

33:46.558 --> 33:48.692
That's a shitty answer.

33:48.694 --> 33:50.761
Maybe you have to be ready.

33:50.763 --> 33:53.563
They can't just walk
right into your life

33:53.565 --> 33:55.165
and command you
to pay attention?

33:55.167 --> 33:56.466
Maybe they already have,
maybe they already did,

33:56.468 --> 33:59.269
like, a thousand times,
but like Scully,

33:59.271 --> 34:01.371
see, I was listening,

34:01.373 --> 34:03.340
you weren't ready
to see them yet.

34:05.611 --> 34:07.177
Oh, this is actually
really weird.

34:07.179 --> 34:11.380
Izzy, do you wanna
come with me to this?

34:16.822 --> 34:18.388
- You're not serious.
- Izzy.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.090
You have to leave the
house at some point.

34:20.092 --> 34:21.658
If you spend one more second

34:21.659 --> 34:24.527
moping over those pussy-ass
bitches, Ross and Aaron,

34:24.530 --> 34:27.664
I'm gonna hit you over the
head with a cast-iron skillet.

34:27.666 --> 34:31.635
I'm going to Fox Mulder's
poetry party book launch?

34:31.637 --> 34:34.071
This is incredible timing,
this is such good news.

34:34.072 --> 34:36.672
So many important
questions, namely,

34:36.675 --> 34:38.542
I've been wanting to ask
him about that kid,

34:38.543 --> 34:40.744
Gibson Frayes, who
just disappears

34:40.746 --> 34:43.813
at the end of season five,
with no explanation.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.449
And it's like, what
happens to him?

34:50.589 --> 34:52.489
So is that a yes?

34:52.491 --> 34:54.757
- Yes!
- That was a yes.

34:54.760 --> 34:56.493
Hm.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.562
She's looking for
David Duchovny.

34:58.564 --> 35:00.297
Oh, thanks.

35:00.299 --> 35:03.200
Oh, so my agent, uh, Joey,
he's gonna be here today.

35:03.202 --> 35:04.701
And I know we talked
about this in New York,

35:04.703 --> 35:06.436
but he said that he'd send
you on a few auditions.

35:06.438 --> 35:09.406
Just go talk to her,
okay, you'll be fine.

35:09.408 --> 35:10.440
- See how you do.
- Oh, okay.

35:10.442 --> 35:11.541
- Yeah.
- Cool, cool.

35:11.543 --> 35:13.543
- So when he gets here...
- Yeah?

35:13.545 --> 35:14.845
- Chat him up.
- Right.

35:14.847 --> 35:16.847
- Right?
- Okay.

35:16.849 --> 35:20.150
Um, yeah, chat 'em, whoa,
totally chatting that up.

35:20.152 --> 35:21.718
- On two...
- Izzy, don't.

35:21.720 --> 35:23.487
- It'll get grease on my dress.
- That's not even like a...

35:23.489 --> 35:25.555
- Oh, my God, oh...
- Whoa, are you okay?

35:25.557 --> 35:26.756
- Whoa!
- I'm sorry.

35:26.758 --> 35:28.525
- Wait, that was kinda...
- That was hard.

35:28.527 --> 35:30.293
You, you're the drum...

35:30.295 --> 35:31.862
- I'm the... No.
- Oh, my God!

35:31.864 --> 35:34.464
- You're Aaron Ezra's girlfriend!
- You're Aaron's drummer!

35:34.466 --> 35:35.799
- No.
- No. Oh, no, no.

35:35.801 --> 35:37.167
We don't date anymore, we...

35:37.169 --> 35:38.401
- I'm solo.
- We broke up, yeah.

35:38.403 --> 35:39.769
- This is my band now, this.
- Okay.

35:39.771 --> 35:41.471
- You wanna...
- I'll go... You wanna go first?

35:41.473 --> 35:43.140
- I'll go first. Okay.
- You go first.

35:43.142 --> 35:45.809
- I'm Izzy Klein, I'm sorry.
- I'm Logan Holts.

35:45.811 --> 35:48.245
- Nice-nice to meet you.
- Nice to officially meet you.

35:48.247 --> 35:49.279
- Officially meet you.
- Yeah.

35:49.281 --> 35:50.380
It looks like you

35:50.382 --> 35:51.615
folded on that one.

35:51.617 --> 35:54.551
- Folded?
- The slang, folded?

35:54.553 --> 35:56.620
Yeah, I mean, I can, I
can, um, make it up to you

35:56.622 --> 35:58.488
later on, if you're down
for, like, the In-N-Out?

35:58.490 --> 36:00.390
- I love In-N-Out.
- One, two, three, burger?

36:00.392 --> 36:02.225
- One, two, three, burger!
- Burger!

36:02.227 --> 36:03.460
- Yeah.
- So I'mma see you in a minute.

36:03.462 --> 36:05.629
- Okay.
- All right.

36:05.631 --> 36:07.764
Was I supposed to pound?

36:08.734 --> 36:10.901
But I clapped...

36:10.903 --> 36:13.737
I mean, she used to
date my friend, Aaron.

36:13.739 --> 36:15.272
She was dating my
friend, Aaron, I mean,

36:15.274 --> 36:16.573
we played in a band
together, you know,

36:16.575 --> 36:18.341
of course, now I
got my own band.

36:18.343 --> 36:19.910
Gravy, you know?

36:19.912 --> 36:21.811
She was beautiful, I
mean, I never looked...

36:21.813 --> 36:24.314
I looked at her, you know,
she was my friend's,

36:24.316 --> 36:25.749
friend's, uh, girl, so...

36:25.751 --> 36:26.750
So you guys are the producers

36:26.752 --> 36:28.218
of all nine seasons

36:28.220 --> 36:29.286
of <i> The X-Files?</i>

36:29.288 --> 36:31.288
So my sister is gonna freak out.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.389
- Yeah.
- She's obsessed.

36:32.391 --> 36:34.224
Excuse me, I'm so sorry.

36:34.226 --> 36:35.859
I'm leaving with the drummer.

36:35.861 --> 36:38.261
- Oh, that a girl. Yeah.
- Yeah.

36:38.263 --> 36:40.263
You don't wanna meet Fox Mulder?

36:40.265 --> 36:42.566
No, no, I do wanna
meet Fox Mulder,

36:42.568 --> 36:44.634
but, uh, you know, he's
at the point right now

36:44.636 --> 36:46.436
of being unfashionably late.

36:46.438 --> 36:49.206
Listen, Izzy, don't
get into a car

36:49.208 --> 36:51.308
with a stranger, that's
rule number-one of life.

36:51.310 --> 36:52.509
No, no, no, no, no, I know him.

36:52.511 --> 36:53.977
He wants to buy me
a cheeseburger.

36:53.979 --> 36:55.545
- Oh, then it's fine.
- Mm...

36:55.547 --> 36:57.614
CTFO.

36:57.616 --> 36:59.683
The chill, the chill... Does
that mean "Chill The Fuck Out?"

36:59.685 --> 37:01.751
Yeah, which makes me wonder,
is she on mushrooms?

37:01.753 --> 37:03.253
- Oh, TBH, honey...
- Oh, my God.

37:03.255 --> 37:04.554
We're doing way too
much acronym-ing.

37:04.556 --> 37:06.556
- Not enough mushrooms.
- Mm...

37:08.460 --> 37:11.328
So, um, what's the deal
with you and Aaron lately?

37:11.330 --> 37:12.629
Uh, I don't know, we left things

37:12.631 --> 37:16.700
on a very janky note.

37:19.605 --> 37:21.304
You're beautiful.

37:21.306 --> 37:22.939
No, uh-uh.

37:22.941 --> 37:26.276
Yeah, you are. You
don't believe me?

37:26.278 --> 37:28.011
I mean, I don't
know you, really.

37:28.013 --> 37:29.646
I know you.

37:30.716 --> 37:33.550
- How?
- Band's rehearsals.

37:33.552 --> 37:35.485
Uh, how could, how could
you have noticed me?

37:35.487 --> 37:37.420
I just, like, sat in the corner

37:37.422 --> 37:39.389
and did dumb school stuff.

37:39.391 --> 37:41.725
Yeah, I noticed you,

37:41.727 --> 37:44.928
but you didn't
notice me noticing.

37:58.777 --> 38:00.343
Wow.

38:02.281 --> 38:05.515
Yeah, that confirms it.

38:05.517 --> 38:07.484
Fine.

38:08.520 --> 38:09.919
Game!

38:11.423 --> 38:12.656
- There's a game?
- No.

38:12.658 --> 38:13.890
We should go. Oh.

38:13.892 --> 38:15.932
That was my way of inviting you.

38:17.663 --> 38:20.330
Mm, we should have sex, we
should definitely have sex.

38:20.332 --> 38:21.431
- Let's have sex.
- Yeah, let's have sex.

38:21.433 --> 38:22.966
Yeah, sex, okay.
Do you have a...

38:22.968 --> 38:24.734
Um, do you have a...

38:24.736 --> 38:27.003
- A condom. Yeah, of course.
- Yeah.

38:27.005 --> 38:29.673
Oh, Izzy, there we go.

38:29.675 --> 38:32.842
- Which color should we...
- Don't care, any color, any.

38:32.844 --> 38:34.477
- Okay, I'm gonna go blue...
- Put it on.

38:34.479 --> 38:36.313
I'mma go blue. Just
fuck it, just...

38:36.315 --> 38:37.847
Here, you put it on.
You wanna put it on?

38:37.849 --> 38:40.617
- Okay.
- It's hot as shit, okay.

38:40.619 --> 38:42.652
Uh, yeah, right there, oh.

38:42.654 --> 38:43.920
Okay, okay.

38:43.922 --> 38:47.424
- Oh, oh. Oh, my.
- Oh. Okay.

38:47.426 --> 38:48.825
Okay.

38:50.896 --> 38:52.562
Mm, do you have any, like, lube?

38:52.564 --> 38:53.863
It's just, like, so
rubbery down there.

38:53.865 --> 38:54.931
- Wait, wait, wait.
- Do you have lube?

38:54.933 --> 38:56.399
- You need lube?
- Yeah, lube.

38:56.401 --> 38:57.734
- There's a thing...
- Yeah.

38:57.736 --> 38:59.035
- Is it too big, is it?
- No.

38:59.037 --> 39:01.705
It's great, it's
great, it's good.

39:01.707 --> 39:02.939
Okay. Ah.

39:02.941 --> 39:05.475
- Ah. Okay. Okay.
- Ah.

39:05.477 --> 39:06.543
Yeah, yeah, yeah, there you are.

39:06.545 --> 39:07.577
All right, all right, all right.

39:07.579 --> 39:08.978
Yeah.

39:11.516 --> 39:14.584
Okay, okay, do you think,
can I, can I get on top?

39:14.586 --> 39:15.652
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- On top?

39:15.654 --> 39:16.953
- Yeah? Okay?
- Just...

39:16.955 --> 39:18.455
Okay, we should probably
get on the floor.

39:18.457 --> 39:20.390
- Okay, the floor?
- On the floor.

39:20.392 --> 39:22.759
Stay in, stay in,
stay in, stay in.

39:22.761 --> 39:26.062
Oh, that's, yeah. Whoa, that...
Oh, my God.

39:26.064 --> 39:28.565
- There's some sweat everywhere.
- What, sweat?

39:28.567 --> 39:30.367
Oh, no, sweat is what's so good.

39:30.369 --> 39:32.869
Okay. Ah, oh, my God, but
okay, can I get on top?

39:32.871 --> 39:35.004
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
get on top, please.

39:35.006 --> 39:37.674
- Did you need me to take it?
- Yeah, no, no, I got it.

39:37.676 --> 39:39.008
- You might be...
- Yeah, yeah, all right.

39:39.010 --> 39:41.745
Wait, okay, is it...
Is it too big?

39:41.747 --> 39:43.780
No, no, it's big, I mean, it's big.
Yeah.

39:43.782 --> 39:45.115
- How big is it?
- It's super big.

39:45.117 --> 39:46.750
- It's too big?
- Yeah, yeah, really big.

39:46.752 --> 39:49.152
What, what the, what's on me?

39:49.154 --> 39:51.988
Wait, is it, what... I
should, we should come.

39:51.990 --> 39:53.390
Yeah, no, no, you go, you go.

39:53.392 --> 39:55.525
- Oh!
- Oh!

39:55.527 --> 39:56.793
Yeah.

39:56.795 --> 39:58.895
Gravy, whoo!

40:00.665 --> 40:02.899
Whoo. Ooh.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.100
It's hot.

40:04.102 --> 40:06.936
That's the best sex I ever had.

40:09.908 --> 40:11.841
- Okay.
- Oh, kiss me.

40:11.843 --> 40:13.843
- Kiss me, kiss me. Mwah.
- Yeah. Yeah.

40:16.782 --> 40:17.981
Are you guys up?

40:17.983 --> 40:19.549
I need some advice.

40:19.551 --> 40:21.518
My day honestly cannot continue.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.553
- Until it's talked through.
- It's 6:30 a.m., Izzy.

40:23.555 --> 40:25.188
Traffic, it's dead, then alive

40:25.190 --> 40:27.023
between the hours of 5:00
and 10:00, but, you know,

40:27.025 --> 40:29.492
it's just how the
cookie crumbled, so.

40:29.494 --> 40:31.060
- How many cups?
- Four.

40:31.062 --> 40:34.697
And if my math's correct,
that'd make it 24 sugars.

40:34.699 --> 40:37.600
I had sex with the drummer.
His name's Logan.

40:37.602 --> 40:39.202
- We know.
- What do you mean, you know?

40:39.204 --> 40:40.970
I smell like sex, don't I?

40:40.972 --> 40:42.672
No, it's the same dress
from last night.

40:42.674 --> 40:44.574
Oh, okay.

40:44.576 --> 40:46.709
So, uh, I have some
technical issues

40:46.711 --> 40:48.178
that I need to discuss.
Can I go?

40:48.180 --> 40:49.579
- You can go.
- You can go.

40:49.581 --> 40:50.880
We were using lube,

40:50.882 --> 40:52.916
and, uh, it exploded.

40:52.918 --> 40:55.485
And then we got on the floor
and then I got on top

40:55.487 --> 40:57.687
and then he kept
asking me to tell him,

40:57.689 --> 41:01.991
uh, how big his peen is.
And that was awkward.

41:01.993 --> 41:04.961
Oh, that's everything to a guy.
You just gotta lie.

41:04.963 --> 41:06.729
- Yeah, I agree.
- Yeah, okay.

41:06.731 --> 41:08.698
Uh, a-and also, he sweats a lot,

41:08.700 --> 41:10.467
like, it was dripping
off his nose

41:10.469 --> 41:12.068
onto my forehead,
like, right there.

41:12.070 --> 41:14.070
- I think you have to go.
- No, be quiet.

41:14.072 --> 41:15.104
I need you to, Izzy...

41:15.106 --> 41:16.606
So this guy, are you gonna

41:16.608 --> 41:17.640
see him again or no?

41:17.642 --> 41:18.908
Okay, well, that's the thing.

41:18.910 --> 41:20.243
I mean, I decided
I should try out

41:20.245 --> 41:21.978
this having-fun-
in-your-20s thing.

41:21.980 --> 41:25.048
And... you know, I really
wanna give it a go

41:25.050 --> 41:26.516
and he's awesome.

41:26.518 --> 41:27.750
Well, if you can deal
with the sweating,

41:27.752 --> 41:30.153
I say, you know, give
it another shot.

41:30.155 --> 41:32.589
You never have mind-blowing sex
in your first time, anyway.

41:32.591 --> 41:33.823
Well, not according
to him, he said

41:33.825 --> 41:35.892
it was the best sex
he'd ever had.

41:37.028 --> 41:38.795
- Poor bastard.
- Yeah.

41:38.797 --> 41:40.797
- Wait, okay, I'm mad at you.
- What did I do?

41:40.799 --> 41:42.532
You completely dropped
the ball last night.

41:42.534 --> 41:44.567
I mean, Joey was doing
you a huge favor,

41:44.569 --> 41:48.638
and you literally left
before he even got there.

41:49.574 --> 41:52.008
Do I, like, call him or?

41:52.010 --> 41:54.143
Mm, I'm thinking more
like a carrier pigeon,

41:54.145 --> 41:56.045
like, a message in a
bottle, telegraph.

41:56.047 --> 41:58.281
Yeah, Izzy, you should call him.

41:59.251 --> 42:01.518
Not at 6:30 in the morning.

42:02.521 --> 42:04.654
Right.

42:04.656 --> 42:07.056
Izzy Klein.

42:07.058 --> 42:09.726
Mm, no, the producers
thought she was lovely.

42:09.728 --> 42:12.195
She just wasn't black enough.
Okay.

42:13.665 --> 42:16.900
- Uh, Izzy Klein.
- Hi, how are you?

42:16.902 --> 42:19.068
- You okay with nudity?
- Uh...

42:19.070 --> 42:20.870
Side boob, half
nip, you're fine.

42:20.872 --> 42:23.673
- Yeah, yeah.
- Did ya prepare all four scenes?

42:23.675 --> 42:25.808
- Yeah.
- We're gonna do the first one.

42:25.810 --> 42:28.945
The-the one where she's being
killed by the King Zombieber?

42:28.947 --> 42:31.714
- That's what I said.
- Oh, yeah.

42:31.716 --> 42:32.949
And...

42:35.654 --> 42:38.688
No, no, no, no, no, no,
don't come any closer!

42:38.690 --> 42:42.292
You stop right there,
Bieber, back it up, back!

42:42.294 --> 42:44.961
I, I got a knife, Bieber.

42:44.963 --> 42:48.665
Oh, my leg! Oh, God, no!

42:48.667 --> 42:51.100
<i>I mean, she was
beautiful, awkward.</i>

42:51.102 --> 42:53.670
I mean, we both were
artists kind of, like,

42:53.672 --> 42:58.141
you know, it's like I'm
a musician, she acts.

42:58.143 --> 43:01.277
I don't know, it was just,
we kind of had a connection,

43:01.279 --> 43:03.046
you know?

43:03.048 --> 43:04.681
She loved my sweat.

43:08.820 --> 43:11.854
August, gross. When
did that happen?

43:13.258 --> 43:15.692
M&Ms?

43:15.694 --> 43:17.894
You must really like me.

43:17.896 --> 43:20.763
You know it, and I
just got a tour.

43:23.034 --> 43:25.068
- What? Whoa.
- Yes.

43:25.070 --> 43:27.303
Oh, my God! Are you
so, um, excited?

43:27.305 --> 43:28.972
Yeah, definitely,
really excited.

43:28.974 --> 43:31.708
Yeah, that's, um,
how long is it?

43:31.710 --> 43:33.309
Three-and-a-half months.

43:34.746 --> 43:37.246
I mean, I leave August,
what, August 30th.

43:38.383 --> 43:40.249
Wow, that's, um...

43:51.229 --> 43:53.262
- Good morning, Iz!
- She's not back yet.

43:53.264 --> 43:56.099
- She is still on a press tour!
- Right here. Right here.

43:56.101 --> 43:59.035
Oh, shit! I could have got
Charlize and that baby today.

43:59.037 --> 44:00.970
That little Jackson's
very present

44:00.972 --> 44:02.905
in front of the camera.
Thanks for letting us know.

44:02.907 --> 44:04.374
I wasn't telling you
that to be nice.

44:04.376 --> 44:07.377
I just want you all to get
off the fucking lawn!

44:07.379 --> 44:09.412
- Bad day, eh?
- Yeah, yes.

44:09.414 --> 44:11.681
- Do you wanna talk about it?
- Yeah.

44:13.118 --> 44:14.651
I don't know you people.

44:14.653 --> 44:17.020
- Uh, I'm Sven.
- Marg.

44:17.022 --> 44:20.256
- Sketch.
- What's wrong, honey?

44:20.258 --> 44:21.858
I don't know, I just...

44:23.294 --> 44:26.963
I feel like I've been making
all the wrong choices.

44:26.965 --> 44:29.666
I've been circling
all the shit answers

44:29.668 --> 44:31.200
and I also just
really like this guy.

44:31.202 --> 44:33.069
And he's leaving
for three months.

44:33.071 --> 44:36.806
And I'm feeling so hangry.

44:36.808 --> 44:37.974
Oh, wait, wait, wait, you know,

44:37.976 --> 44:39.442
we got an extra
Coffee Bean here.

44:39.444 --> 44:40.943
Hon, would that make
you feel better?

44:40.945 --> 44:42.712
That's not extra, that's mine.

44:42.714 --> 44:44.080
Well, it's fine, give her the...

44:44.082 --> 44:45.948
It's, it's, it's hazelnut.

44:45.950 --> 44:47.950
No, no, it's a pure
chocolate blended.

44:47.952 --> 44:50.086
- Oh.
- It's yours.

44:50.088 --> 44:52.155
Really? That's my favorite.

44:59.764 --> 45:01.064
Wow.

45:01.066 --> 45:02.098
I don't know, I-I just...

45:02.100 --> 45:04.100
I'm just thinking, like, maybe,

45:04.102 --> 45:06.402
when I get back, I'm
gonna take you on a trip

45:06.404 --> 45:09.238
to Cabo, Ohi.

45:09.240 --> 45:11.307
Van Nuys. That's right
within my budget.

45:11.309 --> 45:13.176
- That's.
- Logan.

45:13.178 --> 45:14.444
- Logan!
- What?

45:14.446 --> 45:15.945
When are you gonna
play some music?

45:15.947 --> 45:17.280
Oh, just in a minute,
in a minute.

45:17.282 --> 45:19.315
- Got it.
- All right.

45:19.317 --> 45:21.851
Hey, um, really quick.

45:21.853 --> 45:24.487
I know that we haven't talked

45:24.489 --> 45:28.925
about being, like,
exclusive or anything.

45:28.927 --> 45:31.294
I just want you to know
that, like, if you...

45:31.296 --> 45:33.863
sleep with someone, if you
spend the night with someone

45:33.865 --> 45:37.133
while you're on the
road, totally cool.

45:37.135 --> 45:39.135
- I'm not going to.
- No, no, no.

45:39.137 --> 45:42.171
I-I want you to know that I'm,
no, like, stage-five clinger.

45:42.173 --> 45:46.142
I wouldn't freak
out or anything.

45:46.144 --> 45:48.811
And you want me to be
faithful or do you want me...

45:48.813 --> 45:50.213
- Huh, wait, what?
- Go, go, go.

45:50.215 --> 45:54.083
- All right. All right.
- It's fine, it's fine.

45:54.085 --> 45:55.805
Come on, everybody, let's
hear it for Logan.

46:23.214 --> 46:25.481
"I mean, I know she's
still in love with you,

46:25.483 --> 46:28.117
"even if you're not
still in love with her.

46:28.119 --> 46:30.186
I mean, she's my best friend."

46:30.188 --> 46:34.524
Honey, I love that you're
so obviously method.

46:34.526 --> 46:36.192
- Sorry?
- You know the greasy hair.

46:36.194 --> 46:38.227
The bags under your eyes,
the next-day clothes.

46:38.229 --> 46:39.996
- Oh, thank, thank you.
- You're welcome.

46:39.998 --> 46:42.498
The thing is, the scene
needs more punch!

46:42.500 --> 46:43.933
Punch?

46:43.935 --> 46:46.002
You're supposed to
be dry humping him.

46:46.004 --> 46:48.504
Do me a favor, next
time you do the scene,

46:48.506 --> 46:51.040
uh, pretend Chad is the chair.

46:51.042 --> 46:53.476
I need to see more physicality

46:53.478 --> 46:55.077
on the tape.

46:55.079 --> 46:56.445
- You ready?
- Okay.

46:56.447 --> 46:58.915
- And go.
- Um...

46:58.917 --> 47:00.416
Okay.

47:00.418 --> 47:01.984
- This, right.
- All right, okay.

47:01.986 --> 47:03.019
- Right, right.
- This good?

47:03.021 --> 47:04.053
- Uh-huh, go.
- Okay.

47:04.055 --> 47:05.288
Um, "Chad

47:05.290 --> 47:06.889
"I don't think this
is a good idea.

47:06.891 --> 47:08.891
You're still dating Sarah..."

47:08.893 --> 47:10.426
Yeah, more, more, I
don't believe you.

47:10.428 --> 47:11.928
- Well...
- Give me a scream!

47:11.930 --> 47:14.430
Ah, but she's still
my best friend!

47:17.435 --> 47:19.335
You know, I think we got
it, I think we got it.

47:19.337 --> 47:21.337
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

47:21.339 --> 47:24.140
Thanks so much for coming in.

47:24.142 --> 47:28.211
- Okay.
- All right, I'll see you.

47:28.213 --> 47:30.046
Say hi to your sister for me.

47:30.048 --> 47:32.949
Oh, hey, Joey, how's
things in agent land?

47:32.951 --> 47:34.417
<i>Not great. Listen,
we need to talk.</i>

47:34.419 --> 47:36.052
- Oh, really?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

47:36.054 --> 47:39.021
<i>I just can't get jobs
for you anymore.</i>

47:39.023 --> 47:40.957
Okay, uh, did I do
something wrong?

47:40.959 --> 47:44.627
<i>No, no, the casting
director is not responding.</i>

47:44.629 --> 47:46.395
You didn't ever hear
anything about <i> Dumb Beavers?</i>

47:46.397 --> 47:48.264
- I mean, that one seemed to go...
<i>- No, not really.</i>

47:48.266 --> 47:50.867
- Okay. No.
<i>- Listen. No more auditions.</i>

47:50.869 --> 47:52.935
All right, um, uh,
there's nothing I can...

47:52.937 --> 47:54.637
<i>No. Happy Friday, though, huh?</i>

47:54.639 --> 47:55.872
- Yeah.
<i>- Chin up.</i>

47:55.874 --> 47:57.240
Thanks.

48:04.115 --> 48:06.616
Ah, it's Izzy. Hey, hey!

48:06.618 --> 48:08.351
- Hey, Izzy.
- Iz.

48:08.353 --> 48:10.419
What's the excitement
today, weirdos?

48:10.421 --> 48:12.188
Well, I guess you haven't heard.

48:12.190 --> 48:13.522
No. Heard what?

48:13.524 --> 48:15.958
Come on, come on,
Sabrina just broke

48:15.960 --> 48:18.928
the huge best-seller Warner
Brothers is adapting.

48:18.930 --> 48:20.663
She's already a big deal, but
this'll be her transition

48:20.665 --> 48:22.465
into adulthood as a film star.

48:22.467 --> 48:24.500
Industry's gonna take her
very seriously in a big way.

48:24.502 --> 48:26.002
I know we don't wanna
speak too soon,

48:26.004 --> 48:27.336
but the three of us
think she's gonna get

48:27.338 --> 48:29.105
nominated, huh?

48:30.008 --> 48:31.140
<i>And another thing...</i>

48:31.142 --> 48:34.010
Mooch your hand out of here.

48:34.012 --> 48:36.279
What about the, what about the,
it's like a succulent garden.

48:36.281 --> 48:38.614
No, I know that
that's, that's, like,

48:38.616 --> 48:41.550
the responsible,
drought-resistant thing to do,

48:41.552 --> 48:45.421
but I want tulips. I
want those big, fat...

48:45.423 --> 48:47.123
Well, like these guys,
like those ones?

48:47.125 --> 48:50.026
- Juicy, fatty...
- The domestic grind commences.

48:50.028 --> 48:52.428
Hi, I'd hug you,

48:52.430 --> 48:54.697
but I'm very busy

48:54.699 --> 48:56.198
with this situation.

48:56.200 --> 48:59.001
- All of this.
- How was the tour?

48:59.003 --> 49:00.536
It was horrible,
it was just, like,

49:00.538 --> 49:02.471
one giant mall after another

49:02.473 --> 49:03.973
filled with screaming,
miniature people,

49:03.975 --> 49:05.641
and all they wanted to do

49:05.643 --> 49:07.443
was touch Zac's abs

49:07.445 --> 49:09.178
and tell me I'm a cunt.

49:09.180 --> 49:10.646
Do tweens use the word cunt?

49:10.648 --> 49:12.448
Actually, he kind of made it,

49:12.450 --> 49:16.419
Zac made it... tolerable,
and even fun sometimes,

49:16.421 --> 49:21.057
'cause he's, like, such
a sweet guy, you know?

49:21.059 --> 49:22.291
Hm?

49:22.293 --> 49:24.226
You just got a new
one, right, Sab?

49:24.228 --> 49:26.629
- Ow, ow, I'm literally dying.
- Got it.

49:26.631 --> 49:29.598
- Oh, yeah, that's big.
- Juicy.

49:29.600 --> 49:31.367
Well, congrats.

49:31.369 --> 49:35.071
I'll, uh, give you
guys some privacy.

49:35.073 --> 49:39.008
Oh, um, I'm not gonna go
on auditions anymore.

49:39.010 --> 49:41.711
- Why?
- Just not cut out for it.

49:41.713 --> 49:43.746
You never try, you never know.

49:47.719 --> 49:49.385
Ten points in the
back end, he's done,

49:49.387 --> 49:50.453
like, two-and-a-half movies.

49:50.455 --> 49:52.655
Iz? Shh.

49:52.657 --> 49:54.223
- Izzy, are you gonna come?
- No.

49:54.225 --> 49:56.125
I'm re-watching season
five, episode 15.

49:56.127 --> 49:57.560
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

49:57.562 --> 49:59.095
It's the one where Mulder's
father is involved

49:59.097 --> 50:00.596
in the conspiracy.

50:00.598 --> 50:04.000
It's my sister. I'm
worried about her.

50:04.002 --> 50:06.502
- Hm...
- Oh, Scully!

50:06.504 --> 50:08.471
How could you reach under there?

50:08.473 --> 50:11.040
Hm. Up.

50:13.077 --> 50:16.045
Sabrina, I really need you
to reset the Internet.

50:16.047 --> 50:19.382
- Izzy!
- Like, now.

50:19.384 --> 50:22.084
Scully, Mulder, don't
you guys realize

50:22.086 --> 50:23.419
you're soulmates by this point?

50:23.421 --> 50:25.254
I mean, a 100% pure-squeezed,

50:25.256 --> 50:27.089
not from concentrate soulmates.
It's just ridiculous.

50:27.091 --> 50:29.258
Hey, it's December, fuckhead,

50:29.260 --> 50:32.028
and I am absolutely dreading
this holiday season!

50:32.030 --> 50:34.330
And because you're forcing
me to go visit mom

50:34.332 --> 50:36.432
and that creature, not
even excited to hang up

50:36.434 --> 50:37.733
my goose-with-real-
goose-feathers ornament.

50:37.735 --> 50:38.768
You have better ones.

50:38.770 --> 50:39.802
That boyfriend of yours

50:39.804 --> 50:41.337
is about to come back into town?

50:41.339 --> 50:43.205
- He's not my boyfriend.
- So what?

50:43.207 --> 50:45.474
You said, "We don't
have to be exclusive."

50:45.476 --> 50:46.709
- I was scared.
- Pussy!

50:46.711 --> 50:48.277
You can't blame this all on him!

50:48.279 --> 50:49.779
You've also been too
scared, apparently,

50:49.781 --> 50:51.714
to get a job or a personality

50:51.716 --> 50:55.084
or a packet of floss for
the last three months?

50:55.086 --> 50:56.652
Well, you promised mom
that you'd go to Tahoe.

50:56.654 --> 50:58.254
I'll make you a deal.

51:00.058 --> 51:02.425
I will go to Tahoe
semi-willingly

51:02.427 --> 51:05.094
if you get the actual
fuck out of this room

51:05.096 --> 51:06.796
and do something with yourself!

51:06.798 --> 51:09.331
But if I hear Sculder
talking to Skinny,

51:09.333 --> 51:10.666
talking to Mulder,
talking to Scully,

51:10.668 --> 51:13.302
talking to Skinny one more time,

51:13.304 --> 51:14.637
deal's off.

52:22.507 --> 52:24.240
Navy blue shirt.

52:26.477 --> 52:28.244
- Totally.
- Hm.

52:28.246 --> 52:30.546
- Wow!
- Yeah.

52:30.548 --> 52:34.450
Um, I'm sorry, what are
you doing in-in LA?

52:34.452 --> 52:36.685
Oh, I'm just, you know,
here for the main show.

52:36.687 --> 52:37.887
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Yeah.

52:37.889 --> 52:39.421
Gonna go to the
Fender custom shop,

52:39.423 --> 52:42.725

black pick guard, preferably,
preferably a black guard.

52:48.499 --> 52:50.166
That's, like,
hieroglyphics to me,

52:50.168 --> 52:52.201
but very hip and
cool of you, yeah.

52:52.203 --> 52:53.936
How do you know Logan?

52:53.938 --> 52:57.206
Um, we've been, uh, going out,

52:57.208 --> 52:58.574
yeah, since the beginning
of summer, actually.

52:58.576 --> 53:00.776
- You and Logan?
- Yeah, me and Logan.

53:02.446 --> 53:05.247
Funny.

53:05.249 --> 53:07.283
- Wow.
- Yeah, not really.

53:07.285 --> 53:10.286
Um, how is your acting going?

53:10.288 --> 53:11.687
- It's good, it's going so great.
- Good? Really good?

53:11.689 --> 53:12.721
- Izzy, Izzy.
- Yeah, it's...

53:12.723 --> 53:13.889
- Hey.
- Hi.

53:13.891 --> 53:15.558
- Hi.
- How are you?

53:15.560 --> 53:18.827
- Hi. How are you?
- I'm good. Yo, um, crazy, um...

53:18.829 --> 53:20.329
- Hey, buddy.
- Blue shirt?

53:20.331 --> 53:21.697
I know.

53:21.699 --> 53:24.633
The only constant
is change, man.

53:24.635 --> 53:26.602
- It is what it is.
- Dope party, though, right?

53:26.604 --> 53:28.804
- Thank you for having me. Yeah.
- Of course, of course.

53:28.806 --> 53:30.773
You know, you know what, can
I talk to you for a second?

53:30.775 --> 53:33.676
Yes, please, yeah, yeah,
yeah, let's, um...

53:33.678 --> 53:34.944
All right.

How creep-tastic is
it that Aaron's here?

53:45.556 --> 53:48.624
How did he even know you
were having a party?

53:48.626 --> 53:51.727
Uh, I invited him.

53:51.729 --> 53:55.598
Um, that's a little weird.

53:55.600 --> 53:59.602
Yeah, I wasn't, like,
thinking about, you know,

53:59.604 --> 54:02.705
I was, about...

54:02.707 --> 54:05.708
- Um, are you okay?
- I saw my ex.

54:05.710 --> 54:08.444
Um, did something happen?

54:10.281 --> 54:12.815
Did you... You guys
slept together.

54:12.817 --> 54:14.583
Fuck, how do I say this?

54:14.585 --> 54:17.686
Um, we're, we're back together.

54:18.556 --> 54:20.289
Together together?

54:20.291 --> 54:22.891
Yeah, I mean, what, I...

54:22.893 --> 54:24.827
You said I can do whatever
I want on the road.

54:24.829 --> 54:29.665
Despite whatever Jedi
mind garbage I told you

54:29.667 --> 54:33.035
before you left, I actually
waited for you for three months

54:33.037 --> 54:36.672
because I like you... a lot.

54:39.510 --> 54:41.644
This just sucks.

54:42.546 --> 54:44.680
What? Are you... Izzy!

54:50.454 --> 54:53.055
Oh, Jesus!

54:53.057 --> 54:56.458
- Leaving already?
- Yeah, I'm super tired.

54:56.460 --> 54:58.527
I just think it's
really fucked up,

54:58.529 --> 55:01.530
and you know what you did,

55:01.532 --> 55:03.699
and you're a piece
of shit for it.

55:05.069 --> 55:07.770
What did I do? You wanna
tell me what I did, huh?

55:07.772 --> 55:11.573
You were a slut and a whore.

55:11.575 --> 55:12.908
And don't even try to lie to me

55:12.910 --> 55:14.710
about the fact that
you just walked away

55:14.712 --> 55:18.814
from a conversation with me
to go suck Logan's dick.

55:18.816 --> 55:22.017
And also, when you talk
about your acting,

55:22.019 --> 55:24.887
it's nauseating,
and you're a brat.

55:24.889 --> 55:28.057
And you're pretentious,
and nobody gives a fuck.

55:28.059 --> 55:31.794
Oh, wait, I'm remembering
something right now.

55:31.796 --> 55:35.631
Oh, my God, it's a crazy thing!
You're not my boyfriend!

55:35.633 --> 55:37.733
You don't get to say shit
like that to me anymore.

55:37.735 --> 55:41.403
You left me in New York.

55:41.405 --> 55:43.872
You kissed him in front of me.

55:43.874 --> 55:46.642
What is this, the
<i>Cabbage Patch Kids?</i>

55:46.644 --> 55:48.010
Yes, I kissed him
in front of you.

55:48.012 --> 55:49.578
No, I didn't suck
his dick for, like,

55:49.580 --> 55:50.612
one-and-a-half minutes.

55:50.614 --> 55:51.647
I'm pretty sure you know

55:51.649 --> 55:52.948
that's not how that works.

55:52.950 --> 55:54.683
Also, as far as New
York's concerned,

55:54.685 --> 55:55.918
I don't know, Aaron,
I don't know.

55:55.920 --> 55:57.453
Karma must be a real bitch

55:57.455 --> 55:58.787
because Logan just
dumped me for his ex

55:58.789 --> 56:00.589
and Sabrina's agent
stopped sending me

56:00.591 --> 56:02.091
on auditions months ago

56:02.093 --> 56:03.759
because I was making
him look bad.

56:03.761 --> 56:06.428
So I'd definitely say
that I'm not pretentious,

56:06.430 --> 56:09.832
and you're right, no
one gives a fuck!

56:11.135 --> 56:14.103
You gotta stop feeling
bad for yourself.

56:14.105 --> 56:17.473
What? No, I get to
feel sorry for myself.

56:17.475 --> 56:19.541
That's something I can do
because I have an ex-boyfriend

56:19.543 --> 56:21.810
who thinks it's acceptable
to call me a whore!

56:21.812 --> 56:23.679
What's wrong with you?

56:25.716 --> 56:28.484
We were always a disaster

56:28.486 --> 56:31.687
and we should not
get back together.

56:34.925 --> 56:37.559
This is an attempt to
try and get me back?

56:41.465 --> 56:43.799
I thought maybe that
we could have sex,

56:43.801 --> 56:47.870
but, but, no, uh, it's not.

56:47.872 --> 56:49.705
We should not talk anymore.

56:49.707 --> 56:51.740
We don't ever talk, but okay.

56:51.742 --> 56:54.843
Well, I don't wanna
see you again.

56:54.845 --> 56:57.446
I don't wanna see you, either.

56:59.583 --> 57:02.651
And I'm sorry about...

57:02.653 --> 57:04.019
that just now.

57:04.021 --> 57:06.455
That's not really a
good-enough apology.

57:06.457 --> 57:07.990
- Well, I'm sorry!
- You know what?

57:07.992 --> 57:09.525
I'm not the crazy one!

57:09.527 --> 57:12.027
You're the fucking
crazy one, Aaron.

57:15.566 --> 57:17.533
Sabrina, this is part
of the deal you made

57:17.535 --> 57:19.735
with your sister. You can handle it.
Hold these, please.

57:22.039 --> 57:25.574
Do you ever consider...

57:25.576 --> 57:28.977
that you might actually
like your mother's partner?

57:28.979 --> 57:31.480
No.

57:31.482 --> 57:34.016
Okay, please buckle
your seatbelt, okay?

57:35.186 --> 57:37.486
Buckle your seatbelt, okay?

57:37.488 --> 57:40.088
Buckle your seatbelt.
Stop it, please stop it.

57:40.090 --> 57:43.692
Buckle your seatbelt, buck...
Goddammit, just...

57:45.529 --> 57:46.795
- Ow!
- Oh, oh, ow.

57:46.797 --> 57:48.230
- I'm sorry, did I get you?
- Ow.

57:48.232 --> 57:51.567
Ow. No, inside, inside, inside.

57:51.569 --> 57:56.205
Jeez, no, no more, un-un...
No. Keep your hands in.

57:56.207 --> 57:58.106
Merry Christmas.

58:00.911 --> 58:03.245
No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no.

58:03.247 --> 58:07.082
Let's stay, I don't wanna go,
I don't wanna go, no, no, no!

58:07.084 --> 58:09.117
You know, we got
this, uh, tofurkey

58:09.119 --> 58:11.587
at the farmer's market in town.

58:11.589 --> 58:15.157
- Cool.
- So you were born Amythyst?

58:15.159 --> 58:16.625
- Or...
- No.

58:16.627 --> 58:19.628
- Actually, my given name is Amy.
- No? Oh.

58:19.630 --> 58:21.630
Yeah, that's why I spell it

58:21.632 --> 58:26.168
A-M-Y-T-H-Y-S-T,

58:26.170 --> 58:27.169
instead of

58:27.171 --> 58:32.207
A-M-E-T-H-Y-S-T.

58:32.209 --> 58:35.244
So your last name is Stone?

58:35.246 --> 58:36.612
- Don't.
- Yeah.

58:36.614 --> 58:37.679
And you thought
that that would be

58:37.681 --> 58:39.147
a good idea to make...

58:39.149 --> 58:41.116
Cabernet, honey?

58:41.118 --> 58:43.785
I got an amethyst bolo tie,

58:43.787 --> 58:46.021
um, uh, from a
healer in Santa Fe.

58:46.023 --> 58:48.090
That's too wild.

58:48.092 --> 58:50.192
Yeah.

58:50.194 --> 58:54.129
That's it, that's all.

58:54.131 --> 58:56.832
Honey, you want some quinoa?
It's good.

58:56.834 --> 58:58.934
Mom, I actually still
don't know what that is.

58:58.936 --> 59:01.136
It's gluten free and
really high in protein.

59:01.138 --> 59:02.170
It is.

59:02.172 --> 59:03.205
Is that something that you bake

59:03.207 --> 59:05.274
or fry? I mean, you fry it.

59:05.276 --> 59:07.676
If you fry it, then maybe.

59:07.678 --> 59:09.645
I wanted to ask, how
did you guys meet?

59:09.647 --> 59:12.014
I don't think I've... She never
told me the story, so I...

59:12.016 --> 59:14.049
What the fuck?

59:14.051 --> 59:16.919
Well, uh, after college,
I bounced around

59:16.921 --> 59:20.556
for a few years and started
doing yoga on my own.

59:20.558 --> 59:21.890
- She does yoga.
- Oh, cool.

59:21.892 --> 59:22.991
Loves it.

59:22.993 --> 59:24.226
And from there,

59:24.228 --> 59:26.762
I got into Deb's podcasts.

59:26.764 --> 59:30.132
And then I found out
she was living here,

59:30.134 --> 59:32.634
just, like, a block away.

59:32.636 --> 59:34.670
Too cosmic.

59:34.672 --> 59:36.972
I did a retreat
about a year later.

59:36.974 --> 59:40.108
- Yeah, yeah.
- And, yeah.

59:40.110 --> 59:41.877
That's great. I love that story.

59:41.879 --> 59:44.580
- That's great. Isn't that great?
- Yeah, that's really nice.

59:44.582 --> 59:46.348
I wanna make a toast to Amythyst

59:46.350 --> 59:48.083
and all our loved
ones, near and far.

59:48.085 --> 59:49.318
- Cheers.
- Cheers, to love.

59:49.320 --> 59:50.652
- Right?
- Sure.

59:50.654 --> 59:53.055
To love.

59:53.057 --> 59:55.691
Super wishing you were
here right now, dad.

59:56.961 --> 59:58.360
Mm.

01:00:00.764 --> 01:00:05.167
Oh, Sabrina, I read your script.
It's quite wonderful.

01:00:05.169 --> 01:00:07.169
But I was wondering,
i-it's set in Las Vegas,

01:00:07.171 --> 01:00:09.071
why are you shooting
it in San Francisco?

01:00:09.073 --> 01:00:10.706
I love how you're switching
the subject, mom,

01:00:10.708 --> 01:00:11.907
that's great.

01:00:11.909 --> 01:00:13.675
I have to pee, for real.

01:00:13.677 --> 01:00:15.077
Sabrina, Sab...

01:00:17.081 --> 01:00:18.614
- Ah...
- Do you know what?

01:00:18.616 --> 01:00:20.115
We've been watching
<i>Bad To The Bone.</i>

01:00:20.117 --> 01:00:21.683
- Really?
- It's bad.

01:00:21.685 --> 01:00:23.719
- That's very sweet.
- And-and there's...

01:00:23.721 --> 01:00:26.088
Um, there's not,
there's no bones.

01:00:26.090 --> 01:00:28.857
It's been, um...

01:00:28.859 --> 01:00:30.959
Would you excuse
me for one second?

01:00:35.299 --> 01:00:37.866
Do you eat each little
individual quinoa

01:00:37.868 --> 01:00:38.900
or do you do, like,

01:00:38.902 --> 01:00:43.005
a whole... big bite

01:00:43.007 --> 01:00:46.141
of all the quin-wee together?

01:00:51.115 --> 01:00:52.414
Sabrina?

01:00:52.416 --> 01:00:54.716
Not in the mood.

01:01:07.064 --> 01:01:09.665
- Goodnight, baby.
- Bye. Thanks, sweetie.

01:01:09.667 --> 01:01:12.701
Ew, mom!

01:01:12.703 --> 01:01:15.237
- You, too?
- Mom, I'm kidding.

01:01:15.239 --> 01:01:16.838
Well, your sister isn't.

01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:18.774
Dude, why is she being
such a honey badger?

01:01:18.776 --> 01:01:21.143
I don't know.

01:01:21.145 --> 01:01:23.111
Maybe because she
treasured her father,

01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:26.448
and he loved her
the most, and...

01:01:26.450 --> 01:01:28.884
You know, it's kind of like when
you're the teacher's favorite

01:01:28.886 --> 01:01:30.452
in third grade, and
then in fourth grade,

01:01:30.454 --> 01:01:34.122
shit gets real, like,
you just lost an ally?

01:01:35.192 --> 01:01:36.725
I don't know.

01:01:40.097 --> 01:01:41.897
I'm not gonna tell Sabrina.

01:01:41.899 --> 01:01:44.199
About dad?

01:01:44.201 --> 01:01:45.701
Are you?

01:01:47.237 --> 01:01:48.336
No.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:54.843
So we're hitting the
slopes tomorrow.

01:01:54.845 --> 01:01:56.244
You coming?

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:58.146
Totes hilar, Debra.

01:01:58.148 --> 01:02:01.216
VV funny, XOXO, your
super-athletic child.

01:02:01.218 --> 01:02:02.851
Bring it in.

01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:06.755
I'm so tired. Will you
do the dishes, please?

01:02:06.757 --> 01:02:07.923
- Mm-hmm. Yeah, of course.
- Will you finish?

01:02:07.925 --> 01:02:09.958
- I can't take it.
- Okay, I got it.

01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:11.727
- Here.
- Thanks.

01:02:13.864 --> 01:02:15.263
Hey, mom?

01:02:16.366 --> 01:02:18.767
- Hm?
- You seem happy.

01:02:24.441 --> 01:02:26.742
That makes me really happy.

01:02:29.913 --> 01:02:31.413
- Whoo!
- You know, Amythyst?

01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:33.215
This is steeper than I remember.

01:02:33.217 --> 01:02:35.050
Yo, peeps.

01:02:35.052 --> 01:02:37.986
Mom, I didn't actually think
that we were going skiing.

01:02:37.988 --> 01:02:40.288
Honey, you went skiing all the
time when you were a kid.

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:42.491
It's like riding a
bike, right, you guys?

01:02:42.493 --> 01:02:44.092
- Totally.
- Yeah, but...

01:02:44.094 --> 01:02:46.294
All right, try to
keep up, suckers.

01:02:46.296 --> 01:02:48.897
- Whoo!
- See you down there.

01:02:48.899 --> 01:02:51.166
Will you stay with me?

01:02:51.168 --> 01:02:53.401
Absolutely.

01:02:53.403 --> 01:02:55.237
Let Sebastian be responsible

01:02:55.239 --> 01:02:58.406
for Amythyst's deadly
pine-tree collusion.

01:02:58.408 --> 01:02:59.975
You kids go on ahead!

01:02:59.977 --> 01:03:02.444
- You guys good to ski?
- Hundred percent.

01:03:02.446 --> 01:03:04.246
- No, I don't ski.
- Whoo! All right, let's do it!

01:03:04.248 --> 01:03:06.515
- I do not ski.
- Bye, guys.

01:03:06.517 --> 01:03:08.517
All right, you ready? Go!

01:03:08.519 --> 01:03:10.786
I am not ready at all, actually.

01:03:10.788 --> 01:03:11.853
That's not... All right.

01:03:11.855 --> 01:03:14.089
Oh, my God.

01:03:14.091 --> 01:03:15.824
Grab my, grab my pole.

01:03:15.826 --> 01:03:18.827
Ah, no.

01:03:18.829 --> 01:03:20.228
That's not the way, you know?

01:03:20.230 --> 01:03:22.964
I feel like that's,
that's not the way up.

01:03:22.966 --> 01:03:24.866
- Uh, maybe this is. Oh, okay.
- Come here.

01:03:24.868 --> 01:03:27.903
Hey, look at my skis. You
want to do a French fry.

01:03:27.905 --> 01:03:30.005
And you want to go pizza.

01:03:30.007 --> 01:03:32.541
French fry. Izzy?

01:03:32.543 --> 01:03:35.443
- Yeah. No.
- Izzy, Izzy, French fry.

01:03:35.445 --> 01:03:37.245
- No, no, no, no.
- Pizza.

01:03:37.247 --> 01:03:39.447
So what happened there is,
is that you didn't do pizza.

01:03:39.449 --> 01:03:41.016
You just had French frying.

01:03:41.018 --> 01:03:42.584
You don't know how
to do this, do you?

01:03:42.586 --> 01:03:45.053
I'm a world-champion
skier, Sabrina.

01:03:45.055 --> 01:03:47.189
Obviously, I know, I
just told everyone,

01:03:47.191 --> 01:03:49.257
like, 97 times, I
don't know how!

01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:50.892
Where's the best place
to learn how to ski?

01:03:50.894 --> 01:03:52.427
On the top of a
devil-back diamond.

01:03:52.429 --> 01:03:54.329
- We can do this.
- I can't get down this hill.

01:03:54.331 --> 01:03:56.865
- Ma'am, are you okay?
- Huh?

01:03:56.867 --> 01:03:58.366
We're fine, sir. Thank you.

01:03:58.368 --> 01:04:02.370
Oh, no, nope. No, not okay.

01:04:02.372 --> 01:04:04.840
I've been a participant in the
Downhill for Down Syndrome

01:04:04.842 --> 01:04:06.575
celebrity charity event
the last few years.

01:04:06.577 --> 01:04:08.443
- We'll be fine.
- Are you sure you're okay?

01:04:08.445 --> 01:04:10.078
I'm required to take anyone
down that's in pain.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:13.949
Yeah, huge pain.
It's all-over pain.

01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:16.918
All...

01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:17.986
- You guys sisters?
- Yeah.

01:04:17.988 --> 01:04:19.287
We were sisters.

01:04:19.289 --> 01:04:22.157
Good luck to both of you.

01:04:22.159 --> 01:04:23.358
Stop!

01:04:24.962 --> 01:04:27.329

01:04:33.036 --> 01:04:36.204
No. Mikey McAllen. How'd
you get so close?

01:04:36.206 --> 01:04:38.039
You know, it's a funny
thing, I actually barter

01:04:38.041 --> 01:04:39.274
psychic information

01:04:39.276 --> 01:04:41.009
for a 100 percent

01:04:41.011 --> 01:04:44.079
guaranteed mountain removal.

01:04:44.081 --> 01:04:47.015
Yeah! Ow! Whoo-hoo!

01:04:47.017 --> 01:04:50.886
Classy.

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:53.989
Smooth move.

01:04:53.991 --> 01:04:56.358
I bet you get a lot of girls
on their backs every day.

01:04:57.594 --> 01:04:59.594
I'll work on that one somewhere.

01:04:59.596 --> 01:05:01.196
Yeah, can I get a gurney down here?
I've got...

01:05:01.198 --> 01:05:03.031
Whoa, gurney! Geez,
no, I'm fine.

01:05:03.033 --> 01:05:05.200
- What's that, Mikey?
- Seriously, I'm good.

01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:07.302
- It's protocol.
- No, no, no, sarge.

01:05:07.304 --> 01:05:08.904
I've got a deep-seated
fear of gurneys, a phobia,

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:11.039
really, that and sheets.

01:05:11.041 --> 01:05:14.342
Sheets?

01:05:14.344 --> 01:05:16.177
Yeah, yeah, sheets. Hm...

01:05:16.179 --> 01:05:17.579
I'll call you back.

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:19.514
Maybe a beer at some
point would persuade you

01:05:19.516 --> 01:05:21.383
to take me outta this thing,
I feel like the Michelin man

01:05:21.385 --> 01:05:23.385
dressed as the world's largest

01:05:23.387 --> 01:05:25.587
banana split.

01:05:25.589 --> 01:05:27.122
Thank you. Whoo.

01:05:27.124 --> 01:05:29.257
- Bridge Tender Tavern.
- When?

01:05:29.259 --> 01:05:31.960
- Tonight.
- Okay. Where?

01:05:35.098 --> 01:05:37.999
- It's off the old service road.
- Okay.

01:05:38.001 --> 01:05:40.368
What's your name?

01:05:40.370 --> 01:05:41.970
You have to guess.

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:45.140
Now you're just being
irrational, this is

01:05:45.142 --> 01:05:46.708
a completely
irrational behavior.

01:05:46.710 --> 01:05:48.510
Why are you being
so nice to her?

01:05:48.512 --> 01:05:50.378
I'm not being... She hasn't
done anything wrong.

01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:52.013
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:05:52.015 --> 01:05:53.348
She literally ruined everything

01:05:53.350 --> 01:05:55.116
that my mother ever
had with my father.

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:57.052
Your father's accident
was four years ago,

01:05:57.054 --> 01:05:58.286
and your mother
wants to be happy,

01:05:58.288 --> 01:06:00.055
and Amythyst makes her happy.

01:06:00.057 --> 01:06:02.490
Okay, no, I get it.
You think she's cute.

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:04.960
You think I didn't see that you
liked her Instagram picture?

01:06:04.962 --> 01:06:07.128
I-I liked her Instagram picture
because it was a picture...

01:06:07.130 --> 01:06:09.230
- 10:36 p.m.
- And, and your mother...

01:06:09.232 --> 01:06:11.132
Quite a late time to be looking
at Amythyst's Instagram.

01:06:11.134 --> 01:06:14.002
They're in a relationship,
if anyone is guilty

01:06:14.004 --> 01:06:15.971
of outside interests
in this relationship,

01:06:15.973 --> 01:06:17.472
it's you with your never-ending,

01:06:17.474 --> 01:06:19.474
tacky, fucking publicity
stunts that you're doing.

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:22.377
Um, hi.

01:06:22.379 --> 01:06:24.980
Hi, Izzy, can you just...
Not now, please.

01:06:24.982 --> 01:06:27.615
So the guy that took
me down the mountain,

01:06:27.617 --> 01:06:29.985
I, I promised him that
I'd buy him a beer

01:06:29.987 --> 01:06:32.287
at Ye Old Shenanigans,
something or other.

01:06:32.289 --> 01:06:36.224
Anyway, um, you guys wanna come?

01:06:36.226 --> 01:06:38.293
- No.
- No.

01:06:38.295 --> 01:06:39.527
Okay, let me try that again.

01:06:39.529 --> 01:06:41.196
Um, I actually need
you to go with me

01:06:41.198 --> 01:06:42.998
on the off chance that this
is one of those, like,

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:46.501
Nightline, Craigslisty
type of situations.

01:06:48.505 --> 01:06:50.705
- So what do you need, like, 40...
- It's a winter boot.

01:06:50.707 --> 01:06:52.474
It's a winter boot, honey.
It takes a lot.

01:06:52.476 --> 01:06:54.242
Forty nine, forty nine minutes...
All right.

01:06:54.244 --> 01:06:56.644
Why don't we give him a fucking
hour to get his shoes on?

01:06:56.646 --> 01:07:00.048
Hooks. It's got a lot of hooks.

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:02.050
I'm just asking,
are you guys okay?

01:07:02.052 --> 01:07:05.320
Yes, we're okay. Four
years, we're always okay.

01:07:05.322 --> 01:07:07.055
Hey, where'd mom and that
precious gem run off to?

01:07:07.057 --> 01:07:10.158
I don't know. Some
exclusive holiday party.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.593
- Yeah, I knew that was gonna...
- Hey!

01:07:11.595 --> 01:07:14.496
I skipped the loop.
Okay? Let's go.

01:07:14.498 --> 01:07:16.598
In, in. Thank you.

01:07:16.600 --> 01:07:18.033
Oh, there's people here.

01:07:18.035 --> 01:07:20.068
Potentially, I might
live tonight.

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:21.703
Oh, this is it, this is the
party, I just remembered.

01:07:21.705 --> 01:07:24.205
- Oh!
- Whoo!

01:07:24.207 --> 01:07:28.443
No, no, no, no, no.
This is unacceptable.

01:07:28.445 --> 01:07:30.612
Mom, mom, what are you doing?

01:07:30.614 --> 01:07:33.415
Oh. Whoo!

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:37.619
No shots. no, no, no, no shots.
No, no shots.

01:07:37.621 --> 01:07:39.821
No. One more... She
doesn't want to.

01:07:39.823 --> 01:07:42.323
I don't like it, and
I don't want it.

01:07:42.325 --> 01:07:44.092
<i>♪ ...I need to succeed ♪</i>

01:07:44.094 --> 01:07:46.828
Hey, guys, it's nice to see you.
Didn't know you'd be here.

01:07:46.830 --> 01:07:48.630
I didn't know you
were gonna be here.

01:07:48.632 --> 01:07:50.331
I'm so sorry you
got here so late.

01:07:50.333 --> 01:07:52.400
I have to go, I
have a 7:30 class.

01:07:52.402 --> 01:07:54.569
But hot toddies are
two-for-one in five minutes.

01:07:54.571 --> 01:07:57.672
Oh, I'll be fine.

01:07:57.674 --> 01:07:59.474
- Hey, guys.
- Oh, my God.

01:07:59.476 --> 01:08:01.476
- You guys, this is Mikey.
- Mikey, the rescue man.

01:08:01.478 --> 01:08:03.578
She told us she could
ski, but apparently...

01:08:03.580 --> 01:08:05.180
No, I literally never said that.

01:08:05.182 --> 01:08:08.683
Yes, you did, you
said you could ski.

01:08:08.685 --> 01:08:10.218
Oh, Mikey, thanks for
getting her down the hill.

01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.553
Thank you.

01:08:11.555 --> 01:08:13.555
Okay, I'm gonna
come with you, mom.

01:08:13.557 --> 01:08:15.790
Hey, honey, look, just look.

01:08:15.792 --> 01:08:19.127

We were both so drunk, and

- Oh, my God! No!

Look at this shit.

Look at it, how am I supposed...

01:12:41.424 --> 01:12:43.624
You fucked Zac, right? You
must have fucked him.

01:12:43.626 --> 01:12:45.693
Or you fucked someone else,
or you just got lonely

01:12:45.695 --> 01:12:47.362
on the road because ever
since you got back,

01:12:47.364 --> 01:12:48.996
you've been pushing me
away, little by little,

01:12:48.998 --> 01:12:50.698
and you don't push away
someone that you love

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:54.502
unless you want out, unless
you fucked up first.

01:12:54.504 --> 01:12:56.671
Uh, to be fair,
Sabrina, you know,

01:12:56.673 --> 01:12:58.139
I think that maybe
you drove him...

01:12:59.843 --> 01:13:03.144
I can't believe you would
say something like that!

01:13:03.146 --> 01:13:06.647
- Stay out of it!
- Let me get this straight.

01:13:06.649 --> 01:13:08.783
So you did this to get
back at me for something

01:13:08.785 --> 01:13:10.885
that I never did,
is that correct?

01:13:10.887 --> 01:13:12.920
This is as much my
fault as it is his.

01:13:12.922 --> 01:13:16.057
Dude, fucking right
it is, dude, really.

01:13:16.059 --> 01:13:19.761
You're a real homewrecker,
you know that, Amythyst?

01:13:21.798 --> 01:13:26.934
That's right, I said it,
because your real dumb name

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:28.436
is Amy.

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:31.539
You turned my mother into a dyke

01:13:31.541 --> 01:13:32.807
and then you decided,
"Oh, you know what,

01:13:32.809 --> 01:13:34.075
I wanna go have
some non-dykey fun

01:13:34.077 --> 01:13:35.643

for the holidays."

01:13:35.645 --> 01:13:38.579
No, Sabrina, I actually
do think that I am gay.

01:13:38.581 --> 01:13:41.449
This whole thing has been
very clarifying for me.

01:13:41.451 --> 01:13:45.153
And no offense, Sebastian, now
that I'm not blackout drunk,

01:13:45.155 --> 01:13:48.055

I'm... Okay, I'm
sorry, I got it.

No!

01:17:52.435 --> 01:17:53.934
Trail mix.

01:17:53.936 --> 01:17:56.337
Why, why don't you just
get a bag of M&Ms?

01:17:58.875 --> 01:18:01.242

01:18:01.244 --> 01:18:02.810

01:18:02.812 --> 01:18:05.413

stuff that's in there?

01:18:05.415 --> 01:18:07.281
Um, I mean, you could
have it if you want.

01:18:07.283 --> 01:18:09.316
No, no, no, I just like M&Ms.

01:18:11.788 --> 01:18:14.889
I'm, um, I'm Sabrina's
sister, by the way.

01:18:14.891 --> 01:18:18.893
- Oh. Why are you here?
- Yeah. Um...

01:18:18.895 --> 01:18:22.229
Assistants must be a bunch of
hoo-has running this operation,

01:18:22.231 --> 01:18:25.766
'cause apparently, I'm getting
paid a legit amount of money

01:18:25.768 --> 01:18:29.170
to just sit here and
eat free stuff.

01:18:30.907 --> 01:18:33.441
That's, uh, that's funny.

01:18:33.443 --> 01:18:35.342
So, um, I didn't
catch your name.

01:18:35.344 --> 01:18:39.046
- Well, I'm Izzy.
- Izzy, Charlie.

01:18:39.048 --> 01:18:41.716
- Hi, nice to meet you.
- Reed.

01:18:43.853 --> 01:18:47.054
I'm the director of, uh,
of this hoo-ha operation.

01:18:49.125 --> 01:18:50.825
You're the director?

01:18:52.428 --> 01:18:55.963
Yeah. And you're in my chair.

01:19:01.137 --> 01:19:02.470
That's my name.

01:19:04.340 --> 01:19:05.806
M&Ms?

01:19:09.212 --> 01:19:10.945
Yeah, no, it was a
great, great first week.

01:19:10.947 --> 01:19:13.380
Thank you, guys, for, uh,
for all the hard work.

01:19:15.084 --> 01:19:16.183
Hey, have you guys seen Sabrina?

01:19:16.185 --> 01:19:18.986
- No.
- No, nobody?

01:19:25.228 --> 01:19:27.394
- Just a second!
- Dude, oh, it's you. Let me in.

01:19:27.396 --> 01:19:31.198
I have to pee so bad.
Sabrina, Sabrina!

01:19:31.200 --> 01:19:32.767
Oh, my God.

01:19:36.072 --> 01:19:39.206
Oh. Thank God. Oh.

01:19:40.209 --> 01:19:42.409
Oh, my God.

01:19:42.411 --> 01:19:44.779
I forgot to tell you

01:19:44.781 --> 01:19:48.549
that I got caught sitting
in your director's chair.

01:19:48.551 --> 01:19:50.050
Are you okay?

01:19:52.088 --> 01:19:54.088
You feel bad about a guy.

01:19:54.090 --> 01:19:57.091
Ugh, well, welcome to my world.

01:19:57.093 --> 01:19:59.393
What is wrong with you?

01:19:59.395 --> 01:20:01.428
Can you not make this
about you, for once?

01:20:01.430 --> 01:20:03.130
Can you try to be my big sister

01:20:03.132 --> 01:20:06.467
for one second of
your life, please?

01:20:06.469 --> 01:20:10.104
This whole thing. I feel
terrible about mom.

01:20:10.106 --> 01:20:13.307
She's gonna die alone now
because I'm a nightmare

01:20:13.309 --> 01:20:17.011
and this fucking boy can't keep
it in his drop-crotch pants.

01:20:17.013 --> 01:20:20.080
You know what I mean?
It's just not fair.

01:20:20.082 --> 01:20:22.516
Because she wanted to be happy.

01:20:22.518 --> 01:20:26.120
We should do a song, Sabrina.

01:20:26.122 --> 01:20:28.956
- Song and dance?
- A song and dance.

I don't care. I don't
fucking care, okay?

01:27:43.726 --> 01:27:45.692
Okay?

01:27:45.694 --> 01:27:47.394
Oh, fuck.

01:27:48.831 --> 01:27:52.599
Uh, I, I have to take a shower.

01:27:52.601 --> 01:27:55.435
- Okay.
- I can just feel it everywhere.

01:27:56.805 --> 01:27:59.940
- You can shower.
- I just gotta clean it up.

01:27:59.942 --> 01:28:01.875
- But then we'll hang.
- Whatever you want.

01:28:01.877 --> 01:28:04.544
I, like, filled up. I mean,
it's a lot, so that's good.

01:28:04.546 --> 01:28:06.380
It's, like, a compliment,
but it's just...

01:28:06.382 --> 01:28:07.714
That is a compliment.

01:28:07.716 --> 01:28:10.450
- Thank you. Don't...
- A ton of... semen.

01:28:10.452 --> 01:28:12.452
I don't know why I'm
fucking weird, though.

01:28:12.454 --> 01:28:15.522
I'm weird about this stuff.

01:28:18.327 --> 01:28:20.394
Ah, fucker.

01:28:22.031 --> 01:28:24.965
Don't get annoyed at yourself
for your real thoughts,

01:28:24.967 --> 01:28:28.368
y-your thoughts are your thoughts.
End memo.

01:28:30.005 --> 01:28:32.306
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:28:32.308 --> 01:28:33.840
I, uh, I got you something.

01:28:33.842 --> 01:28:35.776
Yeah. Okay.

01:28:35.778 --> 01:28:38.812
Yeah, just the M&Ms.

01:28:38.814 --> 01:28:40.647
- That's hilarious.
- What's up? How are you?

01:28:40.649 --> 01:28:42.849
I'm good, we're good,
Um, yeah, I'm good.

01:28:42.851 --> 01:28:45.385
Just, uh, like, going
through just...

01:28:45.387 --> 01:28:46.720
I'm actually in the
middle of a meeting

01:28:46.722 --> 01:28:50.490
with these guys right now, so...

01:28:54.997 --> 01:28:57.364
Yeah, we're just trying
to figure it out.

01:28:59.635 --> 01:29:01.635
Right, okay.

01:29:01.637 --> 01:29:03.370
- Great, okay.
- Yeah, I'll talk to you later.

01:29:03.372 --> 01:29:05.092
- Yeah.
- All right.

01:29:05.941 --> 01:29:07.374
Um...

01:29:13.682 --> 01:29:15.649
I was wondering if
you could talk.

01:29:15.651 --> 01:29:18.118
Do you wanna come outside or...

01:29:18.120 --> 01:29:20.687
I-I'm here now, so...

01:29:20.689 --> 01:29:22.723
Hey.

01:29:22.725 --> 01:29:24.691
Hi, come down.

01:29:27.930 --> 01:29:30.764
I'm just in my socks.

01:29:30.766 --> 01:29:33.633
- Um... Hey.
- Hi.

01:29:33.635 --> 01:29:34.901
This is different now,

01:29:34.903 --> 01:29:38.372
which is dumb, and
it shouldn't be.

01:29:38.374 --> 01:29:39.639
No, I-I'm just, uh...

01:29:39.641 --> 01:29:41.007
I've been so exhausted,
I'm just trying

01:29:41.009 --> 01:29:42.876
to get through these
last few days, you know?

01:29:42.878 --> 01:29:45.011
You were right about the jizz
thing, that was a compliment...

01:29:45.013 --> 01:29:47.781
It wasn't about that.
I like being alone.

01:29:48.884 --> 01:29:50.784
No one likes being alone.

01:29:50.786 --> 01:29:52.586
I do, and I'm, I'm
gonna go to sleep,

01:29:52.588 --> 01:29:53.987
but that's what I need
to do right now...

01:29:53.989 --> 01:29:55.856
Charlie.

01:29:57.593 --> 01:29:59.626
I felt like you saw me...

01:30:01.463 --> 01:30:03.096
and I saw you.

01:30:04.733 --> 01:30:08.568
You saw who I was, that
we could be ourselves.

01:30:09.872 --> 01:30:12.105
And then that was really great.

01:30:16.178 --> 01:30:18.178
Tell me I didn't
make this all up.

01:30:23.118 --> 01:30:24.951
No. You know what?

01:30:26.588 --> 01:30:28.855
It's okay.

01:30:28.857 --> 01:30:30.424
I don't need that.

01:30:34.496 --> 01:30:36.062
I don't need it.

You wanna know what the card says?
It says...

01:32:26.275 --> 01:32:27.841
"Sabrina, I wanna give
my whole life to you.

01:32:27.843 --> 01:32:30.911
Love, Sebastian." Like, ew.

01:32:30.913 --> 01:32:33.780
- Kind of great.
- That is super sweet.

01:32:35.617 --> 01:32:39.152
Can I, um... Can I
read you something?

01:32:39.154 --> 01:32:42.956
Uh, yeah, I mean, yeah.

01:32:46.061 --> 01:32:50.063
There's nothing accidental
about anything for us.

01:32:51.199 --> 01:32:54.768
Me to men is no accident.

01:32:54.770 --> 01:32:58.071
Mom to moving on,
it's no accident.

01:32:58.073 --> 01:33:01.107
"Your disquiet, your distrust

01:33:01.109 --> 01:33:04.978
"to Sebastian, to us all.

"or the sureness

not the curve of the planet or
the days in a year, and..."

01:33:33.041 --> 01:33:34.808
I'm selfish.

01:33:36.078 --> 01:33:38.078
And I had to tell you.

01:33:38.080 --> 01:33:41.881
I had to read it because...

01:33:43.619 --> 01:33:45.652
I'm not a good big sister.

01:34:01.737 --> 01:34:04.738
Come on, sister,<i> Full House</i>
street never lost its creep,

01:34:04.740 --> 01:34:07.374
and I am RDY to Space Jam.

01:34:07.376 --> 01:34:10.744
- Let's go.
- Come here.

01:34:10.746 --> 01:34:12.379
Okay, so, Iz,

01:34:12.381 --> 01:34:15.048
if you thought that
vagina hands were bad,

01:34:15.050 --> 01:34:19.185
this is AIDS feet and dog
wormies and SARS, so...

01:34:19.187 --> 01:34:21.721
Come on, come on, Sabrina.

01:34:21.723 --> 01:34:23.356
You want me to sit
on the ground?

01:34:23.358 --> 01:34:25.258
Yes, on the ground.

01:34:27.262 --> 01:34:31.798
I'll use this only
because I love you.

01:34:31.800 --> 01:34:34.868
- No more wormies.
- Ugh!

01:34:34.870 --> 01:34:38.405
This is gross. Uh-huh.

01:34:38.407 --> 01:34:41.141
I feel like this stuff will
feel better if we yell it.

01:34:41.143 --> 01:34:42.776
What stuff?

01:34:43.745 --> 01:34:46.046
I miss you, dad!

01:34:48.316 --> 01:34:51.351
Oh, okay, so that's
what we're doing.

01:34:51.353 --> 01:34:53.219
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:34:57.859 --> 01:35:00.260
I miss you, Sebastian!

01:35:02.197 --> 01:35:04.798
I'm sorry, Sabrina!

01:35:08.970 --> 01:35:10.403
About what?

01:35:18.380 --> 01:35:20.447
Dad killed himself?

01:35:26.488 --> 01:35:27.954
Yeah.

01:35:29.157 --> 01:35:31.024
He didn't say goodbye.

01:35:42.337 --> 01:35:45.205
I hate it when people
don't say goodbye!

01:35:45.207 --> 01:35:46.806
I hate it!

01:35:52.347 --> 01:35:55.348
You've been big-sister-ing
this whole time.

01:36:00.188 --> 01:36:03.056
Can I small-sister real quick?

01:36:03.058 --> 01:36:05.892
Okay, whoa.

01:36:09.798 --> 01:36:11.297
I ready your notebook.

01:36:13.769 --> 01:36:16.269
I read all your stories.

01:36:18.240 --> 01:36:20.373
It's your year of
spectacular men.

01:36:22.377 --> 01:36:23.810
I never thought
about it that way.

01:36:23.812 --> 01:36:24.944
- What do you mean?
- I mean...

01:36:24.946 --> 01:36:26.246
Don't stories have endings?

01:36:26.248 --> 01:36:29.048
I mean, you'd think
I'd have an ending

01:36:29.050 --> 01:36:32.318
because that's what I
wanted, I wanted endings,

01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:35.421
I wanted answers to
questions, but...

01:36:38.126 --> 01:36:40.226
Ugh! Look!

01:36:41.496 --> 01:36:43.463
Here we are.

01:36:43.465 --> 01:36:47.066
Look at those flowers,
there's a million answers.

01:36:52.440 --> 01:36:56.109
That's Aaron and Mikey
and Logan and mom.

01:36:58.313 --> 01:37:00.847
- And dad.
- And dad.

01:37:03.084 --> 01:37:06.219
And Charlie and Ross.

01:37:06.221 --> 01:37:07.554
Amythyst.

01:37:08.523 --> 01:37:10.256
And Sebastian.

01:37:12.060 --> 01:37:15.161
And they're all attached
to the roots...

01:37:15.163 --> 01:37:18.097
to mine and yours, they,
they're the answers,

01:37:18.099 --> 01:37:20.166
and I don't want endings.

01:37:25.006 --> 01:37:26.105
More.

01:37:30.212 --> 01:37:33.146
Aren't we privileged that
we get to have more?

01:37:39.621 --> 01:37:42.422
You're fucking good,
Isabel Klein!

01:37:46.595 --> 01:37:49.529
And you're my big sister.

01:37:49.531 --> 01:37:51.297
And you're right.

01:37:51.299 --> 01:37:53.867
Things do feel better
when you yell them.

01:38:02.244 --> 01:38:04.878
<i>I kept thinking that this year</i>

01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:06.913
<i>would tell me a story,</i>

01:38:06.915 --> 01:38:09.582
<i>but it turns out,</i>

01:38:09.584 --> 01:38:13.052
<i>I wrote one, instead.</i>

01:38:13.054 --> 01:38:16.923
<i>One with sum totals

01:38:16.925 --> 01:38:20.326
<i>and selfishness and squiggles</i>

01:38:20.328 --> 01:38:23.196
<i>and sistering.</i>

01:38:23.198 --> 01:38:24.998
Do your thing.

01:38:26.268 --> 01:38:29.002
<i>One where certain people</i>

01:38:29.004 --> 01:38:31.371
<i>really should get their ending.</i>

01:38:35.243 --> 01:38:37.911
<i>Everything falling
into the perfect spot,</i>

01:38:37.913 --> 01:38:40.680
<i>the sun shining just
right on their faces,</i>

01:38:40.682 --> 01:38:44.617
<i>a moment of togetherness</i>

01:38:44.619 --> 01:38:47.020
<i>where you have the
extraordinary privilege</i>

01:38:47.022 --> 01:38:48.588
<i>of saying hello...</i>

01:38:50.392 --> 01:38:51.691
<i>and not goodbye.</i>

01:38:54.562 --> 01:38:57.297
<i>I've never been good at seeing
where I should go next,</i>

01:38:57.299 --> 01:39:00.266

01:39:00.268 --> 01:39:03.336

01:39:07.976 --> 01:39:11.344
