was Agent Dana Scully,</i>

00:10.907 --> 00:12.628
<i>a medical doctor and scientist.</i>

00:12.706 --> 00:14.387
<i>In 2001, we had a child

You want the Founder to tell you

01:42.771 --> 01:45.939

is face-to-face?

01:45.974 --> 01:47.407

04:56.620 --> 04:57.952
Noted.

04:57.988 --> 05:01.589
All the witnesses I spoke to
have consistent accounts.

05:01.625 --> 05:02.991
I mean the room.

05:03.026 --> 05:04.492
He chose the most
secured place

05:04.528 --> 05:05.760
in the building
to kill himself.

05:05.796 --> 05:07.262
He was trying

05:07.297 --> 05:08.496
These are isolated servers,

05:25.148 --> 05:26.581
The reason why
we're investigating,

05:26.616 --> 05:27.949
rather than the local police

05:27.984 --> 05:29.184
is because we have
security clearance.

05:29.219 --> 05:30.585
To be in the room.

to pry them open.

10:15.677 --> 10:18.211
on the palm of his hand

10:18.246 --> 10:20.146
"Founder's Mutation."

10:22.450 --> 10:24.117
Dr. Goldman at Nugenics.

10:24.152 --> 10:25.652
Is that why
you wanted to talk to him?

10:25.687 --> 10:26.920
I don't think
that's the mutation

10:26.955 --> 10:28.588
Sanjay was referring to.

10:28.623 --> 10:30.723
Did you find anything else
on the autopsy?

10:30.759 --> 10:32.926
Well, there were
no abnormalities

10:32.961 --> 10:34.327
in Dr. Sanjay's brain.

10:34.362 --> 10:36.563
The opener destroyed
the acoustic nerve

10:36.598 --> 10:38.598
and then went into
the cerebral cortex.

10:38.633 --> 10:39.933
It's weird, because the opener

10:39.968 --> 10:41.167
goes in at 90 degrees

10:41.203 --> 10:42.402
and then it veers off
at 60 degrees

10:42.437 --> 10:44.103
up into his brain,
like he was

10:44.139 --> 10:45.505
hunting for something.

10:45.540 --> 10:48.575
Yeah. It ended up in
the auditory cortex.

10:48.610 --> 10:52.412
You know... he blurted
something out

10:52.447 --> 10:54.514
at the meeting,
before his suicide.

10:54.549 --> 10:57.283
He said,
"Can't anyone hear that?"

10:57.319 --> 10:59.652
- Hmm.
- But nobody else could hear a thing.

10:59.688 --> 11:01.788
Well, ultimately, hearing
is just nerve impulses

11:01.823 --> 11:03.423
interpreted by the brain.

11:03.458 --> 11:05.258
What if those same impulses
could be generated

11:05.293 --> 11:08.027
without actual vibrations
striking the ear drum?

11:08.063 --> 11:10.129
- Hmm.
- Well, anyway.

11:10.165 --> 11:12.098
If he left a note on his hand,

11:12.133 --> 11:13.499
maybe he left other clues.

11:13.535 --> 11:15.201
But where?

11:15.237 --> 11:17.103
We've checked out every
square inch of his apartment.

11:17.138 --> 11:20.306
Well, he leased a place
that only Gupta knew about.

11:20.342 --> 11:23.109
I think we should go to where
he actually lived.

11:23.635 --> 11:26.086
_

11:31.286 --> 11:33.419
(indistinct conversations)

11:33.455 --> 11:34.888
It's hard to imagine,
in 2016,

11:34.923 --> 11:37.657
that Sanjay had to keep his
lifestyle preferences a secret.

11:37.692 --> 11:39.893
Being gay wasn't
his only secret.

11:41.363 --> 11:42.662
(tires screech, man grunts)

12:08.223 --> 12:08.988
Mulder?

12:09.024 --> 12:11.190
(distant):
I found something.

12:20.268 --> 12:21.768
His kids.

12:21.803 --> 12:23.202
Yeah.

12:23.238 --> 12:25.038
Sanjay was afraid
they were dying.

12:25.073 --> 12:27.840
These kids,
they look so young.

12:27.876 --> 12:30.443
None of them look
older than ten.

12:30.478 --> 12:32.111
Look at the backgrounds.

12:32.147 --> 12:33.713
SCULLY:
It's a clinical setting.

12:33.748 --> 12:35.114
It looks like it might
be a hospital.

12:35.150 --> 12:37.150
(car doors shut in distance)

12:40.822 --> 12:42.221
The police are coming up.

12:42.257 --> 12:44.057
We must have triggered
a silent alarm.

12:44.092 --> 12:45.625
All right, look around--
he's bound to have kept

12:45.660 --> 12:47.260
some information
on them somewhere.

12:51.900 --> 12:52.966
<i>(tone ringing)</i>

12:53.001 --> 12:54.167
(groans)

12:55.770 --> 12:57.637
Mulder?

12:57.672 --> 12:59.472
Mulder, are you okay?

12:59.507 --> 13:01.207
(footsteps approach)

13:01.242 --> 13:02.508
They're coming.

13:02.544 --> 13:03.977
Mulder.

13:04.012 --> 13:05.244
MAN (distant):
Police officer!

13:06.848 --> 13:08.648
OFFICER (distorted): Lady, put
your hands where I can see 'em!

13:08.683 --> 13:10.083
SCULLY (distorted):
FBI.

13:10.118 --> 13:11.784
<i>(tone continues ringing)</i>

13:11.820 --> 13:13.252
(nails scraping)

13:13.288 --> 13:14.454
(tone ringing,
nails scraping, no voice)

13:17.759 --> 13:19.759
(tone stops)

13:24.766 --> 13:27.300
(distorted, indistinct, then:)
...find her.

13:28.937 --> 13:30.737
(distorted):
Help me.

13:30.772 --> 13:32.238
(distorted):
Find her.

13:32.273 --> 13:33.706
(echoing): Find her...
Find her... Find her...

13:33.742 --> 13:35.742
(tone ringing,
increasing in intensity)

13:41.174 --> 13:43.141
Do you have anything to add
to this, Agent Scully?

13:43.176 --> 13:45.143
If you look at the files
that we found

13:45.178 --> 13:47.078
in Dr. Sanjay's apartment...

13:47.114 --> 13:48.313
No, I can't look at those.

13:48.348 --> 13:50.181
They're right over there.

13:53.220 --> 13:56.021
MURPHY:
These files are classified.

13:56.056 --> 13:58.423
They're the property
of the Department of Defense.

13:58.458 --> 14:00.091
Well, I've had a look at them.

14:00.127 --> 14:01.860
Those files are
the medical records

14:01.895 --> 14:04.129
of children with grave
genetic abnormalities.

14:04.164 --> 14:06.431
How those children relate
to Dr. Sanjay's suicide

14:06.466 --> 14:07.999
is the object
of our investigation.

14:08.035 --> 14:09.768
SKINNER: Well, considering
the fact that you just lost

14:09.803 --> 14:12.670
access to those files,
your investigation is closed.

14:12.706 --> 14:14.672
I'll submit the report
on the suicide

14:14.708 --> 14:16.674
to the proper authorities.
We're done here.

14:16.710 --> 14:18.543
MURPHY: (clears throat)
Let me remind you,

14:18.578 --> 14:19.978
Agents Mulder and Scully,

14:20.013 --> 14:21.813
dissemination
of any classified material,

14:21.848 --> 14:23.815
either internally
or publically,

14:23.850 --> 14:25.850
will be dealt with harshly.

14:25.886 --> 14:28.420
I'm familiar
with Edward Snowden.

14:35.362 --> 14:37.228
I assume you made copies.

14:37.264 --> 14:39.831
I managed some top sheets
before the DoD took over.

14:39.866 --> 14:42.867
I think those children
are failed experiments.

14:42.903 --> 14:45.870
So you suspect the Department
of Defense is experimenting

14:45.906 --> 14:47.539
with genetic
modification on humans?

14:49.276 --> 14:50.275
What do you think?

14:51.878 --> 14:54.846
I think there were many
troubling details to this case,

14:54.881 --> 14:57.248
and, um...

14:57.284 --> 14:59.250
if Agent Mulder has
nothing more to add...

14:59.286 --> 15:01.152
I don't.

15:01.188 --> 15:03.988
...then I think we need time
to prove his theory.

15:04.024 --> 15:06.191
SKINNER: The bureaucracy
in the FBI has become

15:06.226 --> 15:07.592
increasingly complex
and inefficient.

15:07.627 --> 15:09.360
It might take days

15:09.396 --> 15:11.429
for your incident report and
order to close the investigation

15:11.465 --> 15:12.730
to make it through
the proper channels.

15:12.766 --> 15:14.766
Welcome back,
you two.

15:22.542 --> 15:23.908
Surveillance footage?

15:23.944 --> 15:25.210
Yeah, from Nugenics.

15:25.245 --> 15:28.046
I've been working
on syncing all the cameras

15:28.081 --> 15:31.916
to the exact time code
of Dr. Sanjay's suicide.

15:31.952 --> 15:33.151
(sighing):
There.

15:34.988 --> 15:38.723
What happened to you
at Sanjay's apartment, Mulder?

15:40.627 --> 15:43.361
I can understand why you
wouldn't want to tell Skinner,

15:43.396 --> 15:47.432
but I was there, I saw you
on your knees in pain.

15:48.468 --> 15:50.869
I heard sounds.

15:50.904 --> 15:53.271
It was a high-pitched
frequency,

15:53.306 --> 15:56.975
like-like a steel spike being
driven through my head.

15:57.010 --> 16:00.211
And then it focused
into two words...

16:00.247 --> 16:01.880
"Find her."

16:01.915 --> 16:03.882
There were no sounds.

16:03.917 --> 16:06.151
I didn't hear anything.

16:11.024 --> 16:12.991
Look at those birds.

16:13.026 --> 16:15.560
Maybe they seeded the lawn
that morning.

16:15.595 --> 16:17.395
Infrasounds, Scully.

16:17.430 --> 16:19.397
Vibrations inaudible
to the human ear

16:19.432 --> 16:21.399
but known to drive the worms
up through the soil

16:21.434 --> 16:23.401
to the surface,
in response to them.

16:23.436 --> 16:25.003
Mulder, how are these connected?

16:25.038 --> 16:28.840
The birds, the suicide,
the kids, the genetic anomalies.

16:28.875 --> 16:30.408
What are you hiding?

16:30.443 --> 16:31.809
Augustus Goldman
is the only one

16:31.845 --> 16:33.645
who might know
how it all fits together.

16:33.680 --> 16:35.013
We gotta talk to him.

16:36.816 --> 16:38.016
What are <i> you</i> hiding?

16:39.986 --> 16:42.320
(keyboard clacks)

16:42.355 --> 16:44.422
Sanjay heard sounds...

16:44.457 --> 16:46.524
right before
he committed suicide.

16:47.994 --> 16:50.395
That could be
you, Mulder.

16:52.532 --> 16:54.365
This is dangerous.

16:54.401 --> 16:55.800
(scoffs)

16:55.835 --> 16:58.203
When has that ever
stopped us before?

17:00.840 --> 17:03.608
I might know
how to get to Goldman.

17:04.545 --> 17:07.500
_

17:09.449 --> 17:10.415
WOMAN:
<i>Augustus.</i>

17:10.450 --> 17:12.817
Yes, I know him well,

17:12.852 --> 17:14.819
but he's a very
private person.

17:14.854 --> 17:16.820
Some would say
reclusive.

17:16.856 --> 17:19.324
Without him, we wouldn't
have the resources

17:19.358 --> 17:20.758
to help these women in need.

17:20.794 --> 17:23.294
He's a true champion
of the unborn.

17:23.329 --> 17:25.195
Dr. Goldman is a blessing.

17:25.232 --> 17:27.632
That's why we're
here today.

17:27.666 --> 17:31.336
I've become aware of a situation
that I wanted to share with you.

17:32.606 --> 17:35.073
Dr. Goldman is
under investigation.

17:35.108 --> 17:37.075
Obamacare.

17:37.110 --> 17:39.077
We wanted to spare
him the indignity

17:39.112 --> 17:43.081
of having the government
knock at his door unannounced.

17:43.116 --> 17:46.517
I was wondering if we could
meet with him in private.

17:46.553 --> 17:49.887
Dana, I'm afraid Our Lady
of Sorrows cannot be

17:49.923 --> 17:53.258
a conduit for the FBI
to one of our biggest donors.

17:53.293 --> 17:56.060
Sister Mary, I've worked here
for seven years.

17:56.096 --> 17:57.695
You know me.

17:57.731 --> 18:01.266
Yes, and I know your heart's
in the right place.

18:01.301 --> 18:03.368
I wouldn't ask
if it weren't important.

18:04.771 --> 18:06.337
I have a number I can call.

18:06.373 --> 18:08.239
I'll agree to relay a message.

18:08.275 --> 18:09.073
Thank you.

18:10.944 --> 18:12.810
Ask Dr. Goldman if
he'll talk to us about

18:12.846 --> 18:14.212
the Founder's Mutation.

18:16.249 --> 18:18.249
Stay here.

18:20.453 --> 18:21.452
(tapping on glass)

18:26.559 --> 18:27.959
I got to get
out of here.

18:27.994 --> 18:28.960
What's your name?

18:28.995 --> 18:29.961
Agnes.

18:29.996 --> 18:31.195
You got a car?

18:31.231 --> 18:33.031
Do you want
to call someone?

18:33.066 --> 18:35.233
You think if I could call
someone I would be asking you?

18:35.268 --> 18:37.135
Just forget it. I knew you
weren't gonna help me.

18:37.170 --> 18:38.202
Agnes.

18:38.238 --> 18:39.871
Wait.

18:39.906 --> 18:40.872
I'm a doctor.

18:40.907 --> 18:42.573
You can tell me anything.

18:42.609 --> 18:44.409
I don't belong here.

18:44.444 --> 18:45.810
Not with these sheep.

18:45.845 --> 18:47.312
I don't care what I signed.

18:47.347 --> 18:48.913
The hospital is only
concerned with the health

18:48.948 --> 18:49.914
of the mother and the baby.

18:49.949 --> 18:51.816
<i>My</i> baby.

18:51.851 --> 18:53.251
Of course, your baby.

18:53.286 --> 18:56.087
I changed my mind.

18:56.122 --> 18:57.488
I'm not giving it up.

18:57.524 --> 18:58.556
I don't care if he's sick.

18:58.591 --> 19:00.291
Sick?

19:01.761 --> 19:03.728
My baby's not right.

19:03.763 --> 19:07.999
They saw it on the...
ultrasound thing,

19:08.034 --> 19:12.070
and I had a feeling, you know,
ever since I got pregnant.

19:12.105 --> 19:15.039
But everybody here
has the same story.

19:17.010 --> 19:18.242
Just don't
say anything.

19:18.278 --> 19:19.477
I was just kidding
around, okay?

19:19.512 --> 19:21.612
If you ever want to talk.

19:25.585 --> 19:27.285
I've spoken to Augustus.

19:27.320 --> 19:29.087
He said he'd be
happy to meet you.

19:29.122 --> 19:30.722
Thank you.

19:30.757 --> 19:33.424
Sister Mary, how are
the patients chosen to be here?

19:33.460 --> 19:36.260
They're homeless,
damaged in one way or another.

19:36.296 --> 19:39.263
Alcohol, drugs,
no fathers in the picture.

19:39.299 --> 19:40.765
Men and their lies.

19:40.800 --> 19:42.967
No offense.

19:43.002 --> 19:45.536
Desire is the devil's pitchfork.

19:45.572 --> 19:49.207
But as long as there's a need
and an innocent child,

19:49.242 --> 19:51.242
we'll provide for each
and every one.

19:53.079 --> 19:55.046
MULDER:
It's insidious, Scully.

19:55.081 --> 19:57.882
A ward for pregnant women
paid for by Augustus Goldman,

19:57.917 --> 19:59.884
the founder of a company
with deep ties

19:59.919 --> 20:01.319
to the Department of Defense.

20:01.354 --> 20:03.721
This could be another phase
of the project--

20:03.757 --> 20:05.156
their experiments
in eugenics.

20:05.191 --> 20:08.126
Those women in there...
could be incubators.

20:08.161 --> 20:10.495
Mulder...

20:10.530 --> 20:12.330
I'm not a fragile
little girl.

20:12.365 --> 20:13.631
Scully...

20:13.666 --> 20:15.066
This is what you
suspected all along,

20:15.101 --> 20:16.434
but were afraid
to articulate.

20:17.904 --> 20:20.872
Is this what you believe
happened to me 15 years ago?

20:20.907 --> 20:24.041
When I got pregnant,
when I had my baby?

20:26.045 --> 20:29.247
Was I just an incubator?

20:29.282 --> 20:33.418
You're never "just" anything
to me, Scully.

20:33.453 --> 20:36.320
Do you ever think about William?

20:36.356 --> 20:39.157
Yes, of course I do,

20:39.192 --> 20:42.059
but I've... I feel like
I've had to put that behind me.

20:42.095 --> 20:45.029
He'd be 15 years old now.

20:47.066 --> 20:50.034
And I've missed every single
year of his life.

20:50.069 --> 20:54.038
And sometimes... I hate myself
that I didn't have

20:54.073 --> 20:55.440
the courage to stand by him.

20:55.475 --> 20:58.376
You did what you did
to keep him safe.

20:58.411 --> 21:00.778
His adoption is secret,
his location is unknown

21:00.814 --> 21:02.246
because you had to protect him.

21:05.118 --> 21:07.518
Do you believe
he was an experiment?

21:07.554 --> 21:10.087
I don't know.

21:10.123 --> 21:14.091
What if he's
out there somewhere,

21:14.127 --> 21:17.094
like one of those kids
on Sanjay's wall,

21:17.130 --> 21:18.896
fighting for his life?

21:18.932 --> 21:22.200
All we can do, Scully,
is pull the thread,

21:22.235 --> 21:24.068
see what it unravels.

21:27.307 --> 21:28.873
(class bell ringing,
student chatting)

21:31.444 --> 21:33.411
SCULLY: It's the first
day of school.

21:33.446 --> 21:35.413
Are you nervous?

21:35.448 --> 21:38.416
Your hands are sweaty.

21:38.451 --> 21:39.817
Ew! That's you.

21:39.853 --> 21:41.819
(laughs)

21:41.855 --> 21:44.121
What's the most important
thing to remember?

21:44.157 --> 21:48.125
Sit still, listen,
say "excuse me" if you fart.

21:48.161 --> 21:49.560
(laughs)

21:49.596 --> 21:51.963
The most important
thing to remember

21:51.998 --> 21:53.798
is that I love you.

21:53.833 --> 21:55.366
That's all you
have to remember.

21:57.704 --> 22:00.137
Come on, let's go say
hi to your teacher.

22:05.845 --> 22:06.844
Thank you.

22:10.216 --> 22:12.216
(bell ringing,
kids chattering)

22:16.990 --> 22:17.955
Hi, Mom.

22:17.991 --> 22:19.357
Bye, Mom.

22:19.392 --> 22:22.159
Be home in time for dinner!

22:41.014 --> 22:42.380
(quietly): Will...

22:42.415 --> 22:44.382
I'm scared.

22:44.417 --> 22:46.017
You're gonna be fine.
You've just broken your arm.

22:47.320 --> 22:48.653
Does it hurt anywhere else?

22:49.889 --> 22:51.155
Okay, we're gonna get you

22:51.190 --> 22:52.456
to the hospital,
and take some X-rays

22:52.492 --> 22:53.624
to make sure you don't have

22:53.660 --> 22:54.692
a concussion, okay, honey?

Yes, before his unfortunate

23:51.652 --> 23:54.753
Very dramatic,
but meaningless.

23:54.789 --> 23:56.622
I've read everything
you published, Dr. Goldman.

23:56.657 --> 24:00.426
It seems your research
deals primarily with

24:00.461 --> 24:02.895
genetic manipulation.

24:02.930 --> 24:05.097
Let me try to explain
to you what we do here.

24:05.132 --> 24:06.398
It's no secret.

Proteus syndrome...

Crouzon syndrome...

unfortunate patients.

There's absolutely no cost

Hi, Adam.

25:00.354 --> 25:02.655
My name is Dr. Scully.

25:02.690 --> 25:04.456
How long have
you been here, Adam?

25:05.626 --> 25:08.193
Forever.

25:08.229 --> 25:09.828
And where are your parents?

25:09.864 --> 25:12.531
I don't have any.

25:12.566 --> 25:13.632
He was sent to us as a baby.

25:13.668 --> 25:17.870
Adam has a form
of Crouzon syndrome.

25:17.905 --> 25:20.472
And why is he
in a sealed room?

25:20.508 --> 25:22.174
All of the children.

25:22.209 --> 25:23.542
He has a genetic disorder.

25:23.577 --> 25:24.910
He's not contagious.

25:26.847 --> 25:28.013
Thank you, Adam.

25:29.417 --> 25:31.183
We are working

25:32.887 --> 25:34.453
We need to eliminate
the environmental factors

25:34.488 --> 25:36.722
that could affect the outcome.

25:36.757 --> 25:39.024
I am searching for the key
that was the seed

25:39.060 --> 25:42.194
to all of these terrible
genetic abnormalities.

25:42.229 --> 25:44.029
Alien DNA?

25:44.065 --> 25:46.565
Is that why the
Department of Defense

25:46.600 --> 25:48.000
is funding your research?

25:48.035 --> 25:49.868
Dr. Scully,

25:49.904 --> 25:51.937
I was told that you
were the rational one.

Sarah will show you out.

screaming and yelling)

26:12.960 --> 26:14.059
Did you see that, Mulder?

26:14.095 --> 26:15.794
Interesting.

26:15.830 --> 26:16.829
(beeping)

26:20.368 --> 26:24.103
Something's
happened to Agnes.

26:24.138 --> 26:27.272
We found the victim with
your card in her pocket.

26:27.308 --> 26:29.675
Hit and run--
car was moving pretty fast.

26:29.710 --> 26:31.243
Skid marks from back there

26:31.278 --> 26:33.212
- up to the point of impact.
- (siren approaching)

26:33.247 --> 26:35.447
We're checking
cameras in the area.

26:35.483 --> 26:37.049
No witnesses.

26:37.084 --> 26:38.550
What about the baby?

26:38.586 --> 26:40.018
What are you talking about?

26:40.054 --> 26:42.688
She was pregnant.

26:42.723 --> 26:44.556
The baby's gone.

26:44.592 --> 26:47.159
(siren wailing)

26:55.136 --> 26:56.702
Mulder...

26:56.737 --> 26:59.838
- Hmm?
- Agnes died from blunt force trauma.

26:59.874 --> 27:02.574
Most likely from
the impact of the car.

27:02.610 --> 27:04.576
Her right ulna was
broken in two places,

27:04.612 --> 27:07.446
her lungs were
lacerated by broken ribs,

27:07.481 --> 27:09.314
and her skull was crushed.

27:09.350 --> 27:10.816
What about the baby?

27:10.851 --> 27:12.718
Surgically removed.

27:12.753 --> 27:14.720
I couldn't tell
if the fetus was still alive

27:14.755 --> 27:18.257
when it was taken from her womb,
but... they took it, Mulder.

27:18.292 --> 27:19.758
To get rid of evidence.

27:19.794 --> 27:22.161
Agnes wanted to talk.

27:22.196 --> 27:23.729
She left the hospital.

27:23.764 --> 27:25.497
That baby was the only proof

27:25.533 --> 27:26.932
that she was part
of Goldman's experiment.

27:26.967 --> 27:29.334
What if the baby
was still alive?

27:29.370 --> 27:32.404
Mulder, that car hit her
so hard that a, an adult woman

27:32.440 --> 27:34.606
with the benefit
of a mature skeletal structure

27:34.642 --> 27:36.408
wasn't able
to survive the impact.

27:36.444 --> 27:39.344
It's highly unlikely that
the baby would remain viable.

27:39.380 --> 27:41.814
Unlikely for <i> human</i> fetuses.

27:41.849 --> 27:44.983
In 1973, the Syndicate
was convened to assist

27:45.019 --> 27:46.652
in a project
to colonize the world

27:46.687 --> 27:48.020
by creating
alien/human hybrids.

27:48.055 --> 27:50.522
The project was
ultimately unsuccessful.

27:50.558 --> 27:52.524
I doubt they ever
stopped trying.

27:52.560 --> 27:54.693
But what you're
talking about is changing

27:54.728 --> 27:56.829
the genetic makeup
of a population.

27:56.864 --> 27:58.964
That's the next step
in evolution.

27:58.999 --> 28:01.433
Every new species begins
with a Founder's Mutation.

28:01.469 --> 28:03.535
One child with the correct
combination of DNA

28:03.571 --> 28:05.003
could be a start.

28:05.039 --> 28:06.805
There was a study
published last year

28:06.841 --> 28:09.808
in <i> Nature Communications,</i>
by Batini and Hallast,

28:09.844 --> 28:12.778
that found that Y chromosomes
in the majority of European men

28:12.813 --> 28:14.780
could be traced back
to just three individuals

28:14.815 --> 28:16.548
from the Bronze Age.

28:16.584 --> 28:18.784
I did some digging around
the police archives,

28:18.819 --> 28:20.385
looking for anything
related to Goldman.

28:20.421 --> 28:22.688
17 years ago,
Jackie Goldman was remanded

28:22.723 --> 28:24.890
to St. Elizabeth's hospital
as a forensics patient.

28:24.925 --> 28:27.493
She was adjudicated
criminally insane.

28:27.528 --> 28:29.061
Dr. Goldman's wife?

28:29.096 --> 28:31.630
She was convicted
of murdering her baby.

28:31.665 --> 28:34.666
That body also was never found.

28:40.350 --> 28:43.347
_

28:45.888 --> 28:47.287
Mrs. Goldman,
we'd like to ask you

28:47.323 --> 28:49.256
a few questions
about your husband.

28:51.894 --> 28:53.160
About his work?

28:55.231 --> 28:57.998
Mulder, she hasn't said
anything in ten minutes.

29:01.704 --> 29:03.103
(yowling)

29:06.208 --> 29:07.508
You don't like cats?

29:14.417 --> 29:15.683
What do you want?

29:15.718 --> 29:18.085
Can we ask you a few
questions, Jackie?

29:18.120 --> 29:19.486
Not about my husband.

29:21.791 --> 29:24.525
He is the one
still keeping me here.

29:29.598 --> 29:31.765
Do you miss your daughter?

29:35.304 --> 29:36.837
Molly.

29:36.872 --> 29:38.172
You should see, uh,
that one, that one.

29:38.207 --> 29:40.007
<i>I love my daughter.</i>

29:40.042 --> 29:43.210
<i>But... there was... something</i>

29:43.245 --> 29:46.914
<i>odd... about her.</i>

29:46.949 --> 29:49.750
<i>I felt it from the day
she was born.</i>

29:49.785 --> 29:52.019
<i>I-I didn't know for sure...</i>

29:52.054 --> 29:53.353
<i>until she was two.</i>

29:53.389 --> 29:54.588
Where's Molly?

29:57.760 --> 30:00.027
<i>She fell in the pool</i>

30:00.062 --> 30:02.930
<i>and nobody noticed.</i>

30:02.965 --> 30:05.699
<i>Molly was underwater
for at least ten minutes.</i>

30:05.735 --> 30:07.668
<i>She should've been dead.</i>

30:08.571 --> 30:11.105
<i>I never told anyone else this.</i>

30:11.140 --> 30:12.406
<i>Not only was she alive...</i>

30:15.344 --> 30:17.377
<i>...she was breathing
in the water.</i>

30:19.782 --> 30:21.448
(muffled exclamation)

30:22.618 --> 30:24.218
The other moms
thought it was a miracle.

30:24.253 --> 30:25.819
But I knew what it was.

30:25.855 --> 30:28.388
My husband...

30:28.424 --> 30:31.925
did... something to the embryo.

30:31.961 --> 30:34.061
He used our own daughter
for his research.

30:34.096 --> 30:35.462
I was nine months
pregnant at the time.

30:35.498 --> 30:37.564
I was not about
to let him have my son.

30:37.600 --> 30:39.700
I had to get away
from that monster.

30:39.735 --> 30:41.401
(gasping)

30:41.437 --> 30:42.569
Please...

30:42.605 --> 30:44.805
don't go.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.073
I love you.

30:46.108 --> 30:48.308
I want my daughter, Augustus.

30:48.344 --> 30:51.111
She is safe, so are you,
right here with me.

30:51.147 --> 30:52.846
- What did you do to her?!
- Jackie! Jackie!

30:52.882 --> 30:55.048
No!
(panting)

30:57.052 --> 30:58.786
He took Molly away.

30:58.821 --> 31:01.555
He hid her from me.

31:01.590 --> 31:03.423
So I got in the car
and I drove.

31:03.459 --> 31:05.292
I just drove,
no idea where to go.

31:05.327 --> 31:07.127
I knew there was no chance
they would leave me alone.

31:07.163 --> 31:08.362
I had another baby in my belly.

31:08.397 --> 31:09.696
"They"?

31:09.732 --> 31:11.532
The government.

31:11.567 --> 31:13.667
Augustus worked for them.

31:13.702 --> 31:15.102
I couldn't trust anyone.

31:15.137 --> 31:16.670
Especially the police.

31:16.705 --> 31:18.939
I was so scared.

31:20.342 --> 31:21.708
I was going too fast.

31:21.744 --> 31:25.279
<i>And there was an animal
in the middle of the road.</i>

31:25.314 --> 31:27.714
<i>I-I panicked and I crashed.</i>

31:31.320 --> 31:33.720
(moaning)

31:36.458 --> 31:38.058
(gasping)

31:43.599 --> 31:44.798
(grunting)

31:44.834 --> 31:46.266
(sobs)

31:48.337 --> 31:49.503
(grunting)

31:49.538 --> 31:51.538
<i>I thought I was gonna die.</i>

31:51.574 --> 31:54.107
(rapid gasping)

31:54.143 --> 31:55.776
<i>But that's
when I heard the sound.</i>

31:55.811 --> 31:56.777
<i>(tone ringing)</i>

31:56.812 --> 31:58.412
(screams)

31:58.447 --> 32:00.147
It was so loud

32:00.182 --> 32:03.717
and piercing; it hurt.

32:03.752 --> 32:06.320
It was in my head.

32:06.355 --> 32:07.421
<i>- (tone ringing)</i>
- (screaming)

32:07.456 --> 32:08.822
<i>He was talking to me</i>

32:08.858 --> 32:12.059
<i>in the only way
that he knew how.</i>

32:12.094 --> 32:14.228
<i>And I knew what I had to do.</i>

32:22.137 --> 32:25.839
They said I killed my baby.

32:25.875 --> 32:28.442
I didn't.

32:31.914 --> 32:34.448
<i>I let him out.</i>

32:36.285 --> 32:38.252
Do you know
what happened to your son?

32:38.287 --> 32:40.187
Passed out
from loss of blood.

32:40.222 --> 32:41.622
Woke up in a hospital.

32:41.657 --> 32:45.158
I never saw my boy again.

32:48.330 --> 32:50.764
I think about him every day.

32:52.434 --> 32:56.270
A mother never forgets.

32:56.305 --> 32:57.905
All my training,

32:57.940 --> 32:59.907
everything that I know
about psychology

32:59.942 --> 33:01.742
tells me that
she's delusional,

33:01.777 --> 33:04.745
but, Mulder, there's something
about her that I trust.

33:04.780 --> 33:06.680
She heard a tone in
her head, a screech--

33:06.715 --> 33:08.348
that's what happened to me.

33:08.384 --> 33:09.883
Are you saying
that you think the baby

33:09.919 --> 33:11.818
that communicated with her
communicated with you?

33:11.854 --> 33:14.288
Wouldn't be a baby anymore.

33:14.323 --> 33:16.456
Excuse me.

33:16.492 --> 33:18.325
Uh, you don't work
for the hospital, do you?

33:18.360 --> 33:19.660
You're a subcontractor?

33:19.695 --> 33:21.395
Yeah. A-1 Janitorial.

33:21.430 --> 33:23.297
We're all over the city.

33:23.332 --> 33:25.699
Thank you. Thanks.

33:27.870 --> 33:31.271
MULDER: A-1 Janitorial
also services Nugenics.

33:31.307 --> 33:33.273
You'll recognize
the uniform.

33:33.309 --> 33:34.808
He's cleaning
the office

33:34.843 --> 33:37.744
directly above
the Secured Servers vault.

33:37.780 --> 33:39.746
He's no more than 15 feet
away from Dr. Sanjay

33:39.782 --> 33:41.315
at the time
of his death.

33:41.350 --> 33:42.616
(tapping keys)

33:47.856 --> 33:49.623
Action, reaction.

33:49.658 --> 33:50.590
(beeping)

33:50.626 --> 33:52.259
I made a request for the name

33:52.294 --> 33:53.961
of the janitor on duty.

33:53.996 --> 33:57.164
Turns out he also worked at
St. Elizabeth's last month.

33:57.199 --> 33:59.933
High school dropout
Kyle Gilligan.

33:59.969 --> 34:01.368
We got him.

34:33.866 --> 34:35.232
I'm Special Agent Scully.

34:35.266 --> 34:37.000
This is Special
Agent Mulder.

34:37.036 --> 34:38.668
We'd like to speak
with Kyle Gilligan.

34:38.704 --> 34:39.835
I'm his mother.

34:39.871 --> 34:41.237
Is he around?

34:41.273 --> 34:43.172
We'd like to ask him
a few questions

34:43.208 --> 34:44.675
- about an incident at work.
- The suicide?

34:44.710 --> 34:46.009
You heard about that.

34:46.045 --> 34:47.411
There's not a thing
that goes on

34:47.446 --> 34:48.844
in my son's life
that I don't know.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.414
Well, we'd still like
to speak with him.

34:50.449 --> 34:51.715
He's got nothing to say.

34:51.750 --> 34:54.150
Why don't you let
us decide that?

34:54.186 --> 34:56.987
I don't like to expose my son
to stressful situations.

34:57.022 --> 34:57.988
It's not good for him.

34:58.023 --> 34:59.156
He doesn't understand it.

34:59.191 --> 35:00.357
He's simple.

35:00.392 --> 35:01.558
And he's a minor.

35:01.594 --> 35:04.261
And I won't allow it.

35:04.296 --> 35:06.063
You didn't give
birth to Kyle.

35:06.098 --> 35:08.065
(quietly):
Mulder...

35:08.100 --> 35:09.833
What did you say?

35:09.868 --> 35:12.803
After the accident,
where'd you find him?

35:13.806 --> 35:15.339
Get the hell
off my porch.

35:15.374 --> 35:17.441
Your son is unique; have
you ever wondered why?

35:17.476 --> 35:20.544
- Get out!
- Mulder, she's making it pretty clear.

35:20.579 --> 35:23.046
(birds cawing,
wings fluttering)

35:23.082 --> 35:24.081
(birds screeching, squawking)

35:26.885 --> 35:29.720
(quietly): Bad things happen
when the birds gather.

35:30.623 --> 35:32.656
<i>- (tone ringing)</i>
- Aah!

35:32.691 --> 35:33.824
<i>- (ringing intensifies)</i>
- Aah...

35:33.859 --> 35:35.459
- (groaning)
- Mulder...?

35:36.762 --> 35:39.096
Mulder! Mulder!

35:39.131 --> 35:40.197
(gasps)

35:40.232 --> 35:42.599
Where is he?!

35:42.635 --> 35:43.900
<i>- (tone ringing intensely)</i>
- (yelling in pain)

35:43.936 --> 35:46.003
Where is he?!

35:48.774 --> 35:51.441
- (birds squawking)
- (mother shouting)

35:51.477 --> 35:54.344
<i>(tone continues ringing)</i>

35:57.650 --> 36:00.417
<i>(tone ringing)</i>

36:11.563 --> 36:13.563
Whatever you're doing,
stop right there.

36:13.599 --> 36:14.831
(inhales)

36:16.635 --> 36:18.402
MOTHER:
Don't take him!

36:20.005 --> 36:22.406
(crying):
Don't!

36:22.441 --> 36:25.375
Please don't
take him!

36:25.411 --> 36:26.810
He didn't know
what he was doing!

36:26.845 --> 36:28.845
He was just trying
to protect me!

36:32.685 --> 36:34.484
Is that true, Kyle?

36:34.520 --> 36:35.952
That you don't know
what you're doing?

36:40.025 --> 36:41.425
Why did you kill Dr. Sanjay?

36:41.460 --> 36:44.428
I didn't want him to die.

36:44.463 --> 36:45.495
You made him kill himself.

36:45.531 --> 36:47.497
No!

36:47.533 --> 36:48.932
I would never.

36:48.967 --> 36:50.934
He was... was helping me.

36:50.969 --> 36:51.935
You got inside his head.

36:51.970 --> 36:53.336
You got inside <i> my</i> head.

36:53.372 --> 36:54.571
You can make people hear things.

36:54.606 --> 36:56.606
Like you just did;
like you did to me

36:56.642 --> 36:57.908
in Sanjay's apartment.

36:58.911 --> 37:00.744
But you can't control it.

37:00.779 --> 37:02.979
I just want to find my sister.

37:03.916 --> 37:04.915
Molly?

37:06.318 --> 37:09.119
At the hospital,
where you worked.

37:09.154 --> 37:11.121
You heard Jackie's story.

37:11.156 --> 37:14.124
She told me that he has her.

37:14.159 --> 37:16.126
And Jackie is
my real mother, okay?

37:16.161 --> 37:17.627
I have to find my sister.

37:17.663 --> 37:20.030
Kyle, nobody knows
where she is.

37:20.065 --> 37:22.065
I know who knows.

37:24.536 --> 37:25.836
(switch clicks)

37:30.809 --> 37:31.775
(switch clicks)

37:33.946 --> 37:35.746
Hmm.

37:35.781 --> 37:39.416
Would you mind
if I took some blood?

37:48.360 --> 37:49.760
Where's Molly?

37:51.196 --> 37:53.196
How do you know that name?

37:55.434 --> 37:58.168
My...
(gasps, groans)

37:58.203 --> 37:59.836
...mother told me
to find her.

37:59.872 --> 38:02.839
And what would you do...

38:02.875 --> 38:04.908
once you found her?

38:04.943 --> 38:07.577
I don't... know.

38:21.927 --> 38:23.927
I'm gonna let you meet Molly.

38:34.973 --> 38:36.973
Molly?

38:42.815 --> 38:44.080
(quiet laugh)

38:44.116 --> 38:45.715
What's your name?

38:45.751 --> 38:47.517
Kyle.
(quiet laugh)

38:54.626 --> 38:56.626
No.

38:58.597 --> 39:00.630
Y-You're not my sister.

39:00.666 --> 39:01.598
No!

39:01.633 --> 39:03.433
- (clattering, thudding)
SCULLY: - Kyle...?

39:05.037 --> 39:06.369
Molly?

39:16.215 --> 39:17.380
You're Molly.

39:20.652 --> 39:23.019
MOLLY:
<i>I didn't know I had a brother.</i>

39:23.055 --> 39:25.055
I can hear you.

39:30.295 --> 39:31.995
Are you ready?

39:33.332 --> 39:36.499
(rumbling)

39:36.535 --> 39:37.734
MULDER:
Kyle!

39:45.143 --> 39:46.576
(electrical buzzing
and crackling)

39:46.612 --> 39:47.677
GOLDMAN: Molly!

39:47.713 --> 39:50.247
- No! No!
- Daddy, just let me go!

39:50.282 --> 39:51.581
Get the hell away from her!

39:51.617 --> 39:53.650
(tone ringing,
electrical buzzing)

39:53.685 --> 39:56.519
- (screaming)
SCULLY: - Kyle!

39:59.691 --> 40:01.658
MULDER: - Scully!
- (Goldman screaming)

40:01.693 --> 40:02.859
(electrical buzzing)

40:03.629 --> 40:05.328
Aah!

40:08.967 --> 40:11.001
(Goldman screams in agony)

40:11.036 --> 40:13.837
(tone ringing intensely)

40:13.872 --> 40:16.473
(Goldman screaming)

40:21.780 --> 40:23.647
Skinner, keep your people
behind the red tape.

40:23.682 --> 40:25.015
(helicopter flying over)

40:29.554 --> 40:31.421
Department of Defense has
control of the facility.

40:31.456 --> 40:33.423
It's now classified
as top secret.

40:33.458 --> 40:34.991
We no longer have
jurisdiction here.

40:35.027 --> 40:36.559
Have they found
Molly or Kyle?

40:36.595 --> 40:38.561
You were the last one
to see them, Agent Mulder.

40:38.597 --> 40:40.397
I blacked out
after Goldman's eyes

40:40.432 --> 40:42.465
popped out of their sockets.

40:42.501 --> 40:44.734
Believe me,
you can't unsee that.

40:44.770 --> 40:47.470
Well, they're gone; there's
no trace of them anywhere.

40:48.507 --> 40:51.007
(helicopter flying over)

40:53.245 --> 40:54.878
Kyle's blood.

40:54.913 --> 40:56.646
A trace.

40:59.117 --> 41:01.084
(growls, screeches)

41:03.055 --> 41:04.421
Monkeys.

41:04.456 --> 41:05.855
Yeah, that's...

41:05.891 --> 41:07.791
well, that's
early man, William.

41:10.062 --> 41:12.162
(screeching, hooting)

41:12.197 --> 41:13.930
And that's the monolith.

41:13.966 --> 41:16.366
What's a "momomyth"?

41:16.401 --> 41:20.370
Some people think it represents
our first contact with aliens.

41:20.405 --> 41:22.372
Other people think
it represents

41:22.407 --> 41:23.773
the beginning of
human knowledge.

41:23.809 --> 41:26.209
I... I think one day
you'll probably have

41:26.244 --> 41:28.244
your own ideas about it.

41:35.620 --> 41:37.187
(hooting, grunting, screeching)

41:42.494 --> 41:43.460
Dad...

41:43.495 --> 41:44.461
Hmm?

41:44.496 --> 41:45.996
My fin broke.

41:46.031 --> 41:47.163
Oh.

41:50.936 --> 41:52.936
Space is hard.

41:54.139 --> 41:56.506
"All great
and honorable actions

41:56.541 --> 41:58.942
are undertaken
with great difficulty."

41:58.977 --> 42:01.144
(imitating President Kennedy):
"We choose to go to the Moon

42:01.179 --> 42:03.613
in this decade
and do other things,

42:03.648 --> 42:05.615
not because they're easy...

42:05.650 --> 42:08.451
BOTH:
"But because they are hard."

42:08.487 --> 42:10.687
- (chuckles)
- That's right.

42:10.722 --> 42:12.522
Come on, let's
light this candle.

42:12.557 --> 42:13.523
We'll do yours first.

42:13.558 --> 42:14.557
Okay.

42:16.395 --> 42:17.460
There you go.

42:20.399 --> 42:21.364
You ready?

42:21.400 --> 42:22.365
Yep.

42:22.401 --> 42:26.936
Five, four, three, two, one.

42:26.972 --> 42:28.304
Ignition.

42:34.246 --> 42:35.712
I'm gonna go up
there someday.

42:42.421 --> 42:45.221
WILLIAM:
<i>Dad!</i>

42:45.257 --> 42:46.790
William!

42:46.825 --> 42:48.825
(rumbling)

42:50.996 --> 42:51.961
Dad!

42:51.997 --> 42:53.163
No!
