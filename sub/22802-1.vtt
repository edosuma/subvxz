<i>May I have your attention, please?</i>

00:37.680 --> 00:41.230
<i>The curbside is for immediate loading
and unloading only.</i>

00:41.320 --> 00:44.119
<i>No parking, waiting, or stopping, until...</i>

00:51.560 --> 00:52.960
<i>Attention, passengers...</i>

01:07.440 --> 01:10.080
They should have more personnel.
I'm going to miss my flight.

01:10.160 --> 01:12.038
I'm standing here for over an hour.

01:20.000 --> 01:21.639
Excuse me.

01:21.720 --> 01:24.110
- Excuse me. I'm not in first class.
- Okay.

01:24.200 --> 01:26.237
I'm on the Denver flight
that leaves in 40 minutes.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.630
Could you check me in here?
I only have carry-on.

01:28.720 --> 01:31.110
You're not gonna miss it.
That flight's been canceled.

01:31.200 --> 01:34.352
If you go right over to customer service,
they can help you. I'm sorry.

01:38.480 --> 01:39.357
I told you already.

01:39.440 --> 01:41.830
Tomorrow morning is
the earliest flight I can put you on.

01:41.920 --> 01:43.798
That's not good enough, okay? I'm a surgeon.

01:43.880 --> 01:47.351
I have an emergency surgery to perform
in Baltimore tomorrow, okay?

01:47.440 --> 01:49.955
Look, he's 10 years old.
He's a 10-year-old boy.

01:50.040 --> 01:52.794
Mark, I can come straight
from the airport if I have to.

01:52.880 --> 01:56.152
Emma can meet me there with the dress,
and I can just change in the back of a cab.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.834
Is my mother there? Oh, Lord.

02:03.200 --> 02:04.429
I'll be there.

02:05.200 --> 02:07.396
Oh, honey. I'll be there, okay?

02:09.080 --> 02:13.040
Look, let me go,
so I can figure this out. Okay. Bye.

02:13.120 --> 02:16.511
I'll fly wherever I have to tonight
to get there for tomorrow morning.

02:16.600 --> 02:18.273
- Can you help me?
- I'm afraid there won't be

02:18.360 --> 02:20.511
any more flights tonight because
of the storm coming through here.

02:20.600 --> 02:22.273
- No, you said that.
- So, I would suggest...

02:22.360 --> 02:23.874
I need to get to Denver for the red-eye.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.952
...that you get a voucher
before the hotels fill up.

02:26.080 --> 02:28.640
- Right. Okay.
- Yes, hold on.

02:28.720 --> 02:31.599
Yep. No, it's just me.

02:31.680 --> 02:33.990
Could I get a pen? Uh-huh.

02:35.240 --> 02:36.230
Yes.

02:38.040 --> 02:39.952
Hold on, one second, sweetheart.

02:41.800 --> 02:44.395
Sir? Sir, I'm sorry.

02:44.480 --> 02:47.598
Sorry, I couldn't help hearing.
I think we may have the same problem.

02:47.680 --> 02:50.673
I'm trying to get to Denver before dark,
so I can catch a red-eye to New York.

02:50.760 --> 02:52.672
There's no rental cars.
I checked for rental cars.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.399
He's told me that the flights
are canceled, so...

02:54.480 --> 02:56.437
No, I know. I have an idea.

02:58.600 --> 03:00.080
What's your name?

03:01.400 --> 03:02.720
Alex Martin.

03:04.160 --> 03:05.355
Yours?

03:05.440 --> 03:07.193
- Ben.
- Ah.

03:11.640 --> 03:12.869
Hello?

03:23.800 --> 03:26.395
- Hello? Walter.
- That's me.

03:26.480 --> 03:27.960
Alex. We spoke.

03:28.040 --> 03:29.633
Yeah. Hey.

03:29.720 --> 03:32.189
- Yeah.
- So, what's the rush?

03:32.280 --> 03:35.990
Oh. Actually, I'm getting
married tomorrow, so...

03:36.080 --> 03:38.390
Can't miss that, can you?

03:38.480 --> 03:40.233
Congratulations.

03:40.320 --> 03:42.551
- Oh, no, no. No, we're not together.
- No, we're not getting married.

03:42.640 --> 03:43.790
- We just met.
- No.

03:45.880 --> 03:48.315
I got a twin on the tarmac. Can take two.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.993
$800.

03:51.960 --> 03:52.950
Done.

03:53.040 --> 03:54.520
Oh!

03:54.600 --> 03:56.353
- Hey!
- Don't worry about him. He loves people.

03:56.440 --> 03:57.669
Oh, yeah? Hey!

03:57.760 --> 03:59.353
Whoa.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.720
I won't be long. You stick with the dog.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.400
He'll let you know when I'm ready.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.632
Hey.

04:13.720 --> 04:16.189
We should check the time
of the Denver red-eye.

04:16.279 --> 04:20.320
Midnight. Gets into JFK about quarter to six.

04:20.399 --> 04:23.313
I booked us a couple of tickets.
There weren't that many left.

04:23.400 --> 04:24.629
- Oh, you did?
- Yeah.

04:24.720 --> 04:26.313
Thank you.

04:26.400 --> 04:27.629
Filed your flight plan?

04:27.720 --> 04:31.157
No need to. Still light out. I can go VFR.

04:31.240 --> 04:32.435
What about the storm?

04:33.600 --> 04:35.671
- We'll beat it out.
- You sure?

04:35.760 --> 04:37.956
Flew F-5s into Vietnam.

04:38.040 --> 04:40.839
As long as nobody is shooting at me,
I'll get you there.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.479
So, what took you to Idaho?

05:03.480 --> 05:04.994
Medical conference.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.400
You live in New York?

05:09.600 --> 05:10.829
Baltimore.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.433
But you're from England, right?

05:15.360 --> 05:16.555
London.

05:18.480 --> 05:21.359
- I married an American woman.
- Ah.

05:21.440 --> 05:23.875
That there is the High Uintas Wilderness.

05:23.960 --> 05:27.112
Gets over 700 inches of snow a year.

05:27.200 --> 05:30.034
Million acres of pure-ass nature.

05:30.120 --> 05:33.670
Easy, boy. By the way,
I was stationed near London.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.798
48th Fighter Wing at Mildenhall.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.280
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

05:38.400 --> 05:40.357
Met the love of my life there.

05:40.440 --> 05:43.160
You did? That's so romantic.

05:45.480 --> 05:47.756
Where is she now?

05:47.840 --> 05:50.912
Who knows? That was... that was... fi-fi...

05:51.000 --> 05:52.719
50 years ago.

05:52.800 --> 05:54.996
Oh. What, you didn't marry her?

05:55.080 --> 05:57.595
No, she was already married to someone else.

05:57.680 --> 05:59.751
- Oh!
- Anyway, I'm not the marrying kind.

05:59.880 --> 06:01.712
I didn't wanna miss out on anything.

06:01.840 --> 06:02.956
Oh!

06:03.040 --> 06:04.679
You might wanna strap in.

06:17.840 --> 06:19.160
What's that?

06:21.000 --> 06:22.753
It's Candy Crush.

06:22.840 --> 06:24.115
Ah.

06:24.200 --> 06:26.351
I need to occupy my amygdala.

06:28.080 --> 06:30.914
That's the reptile brain that looks after...

06:31.000 --> 06:33.117
Yeah, I know what an amygdala is.

06:37.440 --> 06:39.591
What brought you to ldaho?

06:40.800 --> 06:42.632
Shooting skinheads.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.316
Neo-Nazis for <i>The Guardian.</i>

06:47.640 --> 06:50.030
- A journalist?
- Uh-huh.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.192
That would explain the questions.

06:57.040 --> 06:58.759
Hey, buddy.

06:58.840 --> 07:00.957
Hey, stay out of the food, boy.

07:04.000 --> 07:06.037
Walter, you see that?

07:07.280 --> 07:09.078
Storm must have moved.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.399
Salt Lake Center.

07:13.960 --> 07:18.796
Salt Lake Center, this is twin zero-niner.

07:18.880 --> 07:21.998
Uh, whiskey-niner.

07:24.640 --> 07:25.676
Affirmative.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.198
Squawking zero one.

07:32.000 --> 07:33.514
- One.
- Walter?

07:33.640 --> 07:34.835
O-one.

07:34.920 --> 07:36.752
Walter?

07:36.840 --> 07:37.990
Shit.

07:38.080 --> 07:39.230
Walter.

07:39.320 --> 07:43.599
Squawking zero. Zero-two-zero.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.399
- I-I don't... I-I don't...
- Walter.

07:45.480 --> 07:47.039
- What's going on?
- What's wrong with your hands?

07:47.120 --> 07:48.110
I think he's having a stroke.

07:48.200 --> 07:49.475
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

07:49.560 --> 07:51.392
I just need you to look at me, Walter.
Just look at me.

07:53.960 --> 07:55.792
Shit! Oh, my God!

07:57.160 --> 07:58.355
Shit!

07:59.360 --> 08:00.794
Jesus Christ. What do we do?

08:00.880 --> 08:01.996
Walter? Walter?

08:02.080 --> 08:03.992
Just get on the radio. Get on the radio.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.958
This is twin zero...

08:07.520 --> 08:09.796
Oh, my God! Jesus Christ!

08:09.880 --> 08:11.758
- Okay, Walter.
- Shit!

08:11.840 --> 08:14.036
- Okay. Just grab that!
- Oh, my God!

08:14.120 --> 08:15.190
Shit!

08:19.920 --> 08:21.991
The dog! The dog!

08:22.080 --> 08:24.231
Shit! Oh, God!

08:28.920 --> 08:31.389
Put your seatbelt on.

08:33.520 --> 08:37.230
- Put your hands behind your head!
- Okay!

08:37.320 --> 08:39.789
Put your hands...

08:39.880 --> 08:42.315
Sit back! Sit back!

08:55.800 --> 08:58.634
Alex. Alex.

09:01.400 --> 09:04.040
Hey! Alex.

09:12.440 --> 09:13.715
Ah.

09:24.280 --> 09:25.270
Hey.

09:27.240 --> 09:28.594
Yeah, you're there.

09:58.720 --> 09:59.915
Shit.

10:14.040 --> 10:16.032
Oh, great. You're alive.

10:17.160 --> 10:18.514
Ah!

11:58.120 --> 12:00.032
Hey!

12:03.360 --> 12:04.794
Hello!

12:05.840 --> 12:07.274
Anybody!

12:10.440 --> 12:11.715
Anybody.

14:43.480 --> 14:44.675
God bless you.

15:35.360 --> 15:37.750
- Hey. Hi.
- Ah!

15:37.840 --> 15:40.719
Hey, Alex. Hi. Alex?

15:40.800 --> 15:44.680
Hi. Hey. Okay. Alex.

15:45.720 --> 15:47.598
- Mark?
- Can you look at me?

15:47.680 --> 15:49.797
- Left home.
- There you go.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.837
- Oh, thank God.
- Mark. Where's Mark?

15:51.920 --> 15:53.832
Thank God.

15:53.920 --> 15:55.240
I need my phone!

15:55.320 --> 15:57.755
You want your phone. Alex?

15:57.840 --> 16:01.390
Alex, your phone's smashed.

16:01.520 --> 16:04.240
My phone has no signal,
and we're pretty high up.

16:04.320 --> 16:07.518
- But we're alive.
- Oh, my leg!

16:07.600 --> 16:09.080
Try and sit up, and I'll give you some water.

16:09.160 --> 16:10.389
What's your name?

16:10.480 --> 16:11.550
- My name?
- What's your name?

16:13.000 --> 16:14.753
There you go. I'm Ben.

16:16.640 --> 16:17.710
Well done.

16:20.240 --> 16:21.356
What?

16:24.560 --> 16:26.870
- I have some Advil in my backpack.
- Oh. Yeah.

16:26.960 --> 16:28.155
Yeah, you do.

16:28.240 --> 16:30.391
I found them when
I was changing your trousers.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.030
Are you okay?

16:34.120 --> 16:36.635
Couple of bruises, few scratches,

16:36.720 --> 16:37.915
couple of cracked ribs.

16:38.000 --> 16:39.320
I'm okay. I got lucky.

16:40.960 --> 16:42.076
The pilot?

16:43.480 --> 16:45.039
I buried him yesterday.

16:51.280 --> 16:54.432
He... He didn't file a flight plan.

16:54.520 --> 16:58.036
No. No, but there was radio contact.

17:00.440 --> 17:02.079
How long has it been?

17:02.160 --> 17:03.560
36 hours.

17:05.520 --> 17:09.309
There was a thing in the manual
about a beacon.

17:09.400 --> 17:11.436
Yeah, it would've been in the tail.

17:11.520 --> 17:13.352
God knows where that ended up.

17:13.440 --> 17:17.798
Oh, Jesus. Mark has no idea where I am.
He'll be going out of his mind.

17:19.200 --> 17:20.714
Okay. Okay.

17:21.920 --> 17:24.230
Someone is definitely coming to get us.

17:24.319 --> 17:27.757
We've got plenty of water,
as long as we can melt the snow.

17:29.760 --> 17:31.080
We've got four packets of almonds...

17:32.880 --> 17:35.111
couple of candy bars...

17:35.240 --> 17:38.950
a half-eaten sandwich, and some cookies.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.316
That should hold us until we're rescued.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.360
What kind of cookies?

17:46.200 --> 17:47.236
What?

17:49.880 --> 17:50.916
Joke.

18:18.400 --> 18:20.312
Oh, God.

18:35.000 --> 18:36.195
Plane.

18:36.280 --> 18:40.035
Plane! I need the flare! Flare! Quick!

18:40.120 --> 18:42.112
- Alex, give me the flare gun.
- In here! Here!

18:42.200 --> 18:43.190
Take it!

18:43.280 --> 18:45.397
No, wait, wait. It's empty!

18:46.440 --> 18:47.396
- Ben!
- I need a flare.

18:47.520 --> 18:49.318
Here!

18:49.440 --> 18:51.397
Quick! Hurry!

18:55.960 --> 18:57.394
Hey!

18:58.480 --> 19:00.949
Down here! Down here!

19:01.040 --> 19:02.997
- They can't hear you.
- I know!

19:03.120 --> 19:04.998
It's... it's...

19:06.080 --> 19:08.515
It's just what you do.

19:10.920 --> 19:11.910
Okay.

19:12.920 --> 19:14.354
We're down to the rule of three.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.757
We can go three weeks without food,

19:17.840 --> 19:19.354
three days without water...

19:19.440 --> 19:21.557
- What?
- ...three minutes without air.

19:21.680 --> 19:24.354
Let me help. Let me help.

19:24.440 --> 19:26.671
You wanna help? This is how you help.

19:26.760 --> 19:28.035
You stay off the leg.

19:28.120 --> 19:30.874
That would help you,
and it would definitely help me.

19:33.120 --> 19:34.156
Please?

19:43.840 --> 19:45.433
Anything that will burn.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.436
Here.

19:54.680 --> 19:55.750
You took these?

19:57.240 --> 19:58.913
- Uh-huh.
- They're good.

20:10.400 --> 20:12.631
I'm sorry you missed your wedding.

20:14.800 --> 20:17.634
I can't stop thinking about him
not knowing I'm alive.

20:20.160 --> 20:22.470
You told him
you were chartering a flight, right?

20:22.560 --> 20:23.880
No.

20:23.960 --> 20:25.917
I was gonna call him when we got to Denver,

20:26.000 --> 20:29.471
and have him be all proud of me
for figuring it out.

20:29.560 --> 20:31.313
I would have got there.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.640
Even if it meant rushing
down the aisle like...

20:34.720 --> 20:36.757
like Dustin Hoffman in <i>The Graduate.</i>

20:38.760 --> 20:40.319
Someone's gonna find us.

20:42.760 --> 20:43.750
You called someone.

20:44.920 --> 20:46.115
You called your wife, right?

20:48.080 --> 20:49.196
No.

20:53.320 --> 20:54.436
Nobody?

21:03.040 --> 21:06.511
I think Dustin Hoffman was
trying to stop the wedding

21:06.600 --> 21:07.920
in <i>The Graduate.</i>

21:09.920 --> 21:11.434
What?

21:11.520 --> 21:13.000
He was banging on the window.

21:14.160 --> 21:15.389
"Elaine!"

21:16.800 --> 21:19.110
Yeah, yeah. I remember now.

21:37.800 --> 21:39.234
Yeah. Yeah?

21:39.360 --> 21:40.476
I have to pee.

21:40.560 --> 21:42.199
- You have to what?
- I have to pee.

21:43.840 --> 21:46.036
Need help with your trousers?

21:46.120 --> 21:47.110
No.

21:51.120 --> 21:52.156
Yeah.

21:58.640 --> 22:00.393
Scoop your bum.

22:00.480 --> 22:02.312
Thanks. Thanks. I got it. I got it.

22:02.400 --> 22:03.436
Thank you.

22:14.600 --> 22:15.590
Okay.

22:16.800 --> 22:17.790
Ben.

22:26.920 --> 22:28.274
It looks pretty healthy.

22:28.360 --> 22:29.350
Cool.

22:36.440 --> 22:37.476
What are you doing?

22:37.560 --> 22:39.358
It's been three days.

22:42.000 --> 22:43.753
We're down to individual almonds.

22:45.960 --> 22:47.713
- We should get moving.
- No.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.679
- It's just best we stay here. Yeah?
- Oh, God.

22:50.760 --> 22:52.114
You're not gonna get far with that leg.

22:52.200 --> 22:54.192
No way, Ben. I'm not staying here. Come on.

22:54.280 --> 22:56.272
I see. There's no...

22:56.360 --> 22:58.033
Alex, stop!

22:58.120 --> 22:59.110
Then you go.

22:59.200 --> 23:00.714
- Huh?
- I can't go!

23:00.800 --> 23:02.519
You wouldn't... you wouldn't...

23:02.600 --> 23:04.831
You wouldn't make it without me.

23:04.920 --> 23:06.877
And I'm still telling you to go.

23:09.400 --> 23:11.915
How hard is it for you just to sit still?

23:18.440 --> 23:21.000
Alex. Okay, okay, okay.

23:23.720 --> 23:26.713
There's a ridge up there.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.833
I'll hike it, climb it, and see
if I can see a road or anything, okay?

23:31.120 --> 23:33.077
- Okay.
- Okay.

23:34.440 --> 23:36.397
Wait, wait, wait. Take this.

23:39.960 --> 23:41.872
You can use the telephoto.

23:41.960 --> 23:43.633
You'll be able to see farther.

23:43.720 --> 23:44.949
Hey.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.074
It's okay if you don't come back.

23:48.160 --> 23:49.992
What?

23:50.080 --> 23:52.754
I got you into this, so...

23:56.120 --> 23:57.759
I'll understand.

23:59.400 --> 24:01.073
Alex, if I wanted to leave...

24:02.920 --> 24:04.559
I would have left three days ago.

24:31.240 --> 24:32.833
Oh, yeah.

24:34.080 --> 24:35.594
Oh!

24:44.640 --> 24:45.915
How do I look?

25:13.400 --> 25:14.834
Stop.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.354
If I can't have it...

25:17.640 --> 25:20.155
you can't have it.

25:37.800 --> 25:39.314
Shit.

25:42.240 --> 25:43.196
Okay.

25:44.200 --> 25:45.475
Let's see.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.195
She's pretty.

25:53.360 --> 25:54.874
Don't look at me like that.

26:58.800 --> 27:02.077
<i>Date. July 7. Endoscopic-assisted management.</i>

27:02.160 --> 27:04.595
<i>Hey, Ben. Surprise!</i>

27:04.680 --> 27:07.195
<i>I can't believe you left
your little recorder unattended.</i>

27:08.320 --> 27:09.993
<i>It's very unlike you.</i>

27:11.320 --> 27:14.392
<i>I know you like to keep control of things.</i>

27:14.480 --> 27:16.551
<i>Mmm, maybe that's unfair.</i>

27:17.920 --> 27:20.196
<i>I've already said this...</i>

27:20.280 --> 27:23.193
<i>but I wanted you to have it for good.</i>

27:23.280 --> 27:25.954
<i>I'm happy that we've had
this time together...</i>

27:27.360 --> 27:29.033
<i>no matter how bad things have gotten.</i>

28:09.160 --> 28:10.071
Ben?

28:11.280 --> 28:12.270
Ben?

28:13.400 --> 28:14.390
Ben?

28:15.560 --> 28:16.550
Ben!

28:28.920 --> 28:30.400
Okay, stop. Stop, stop, stop.

28:33.080 --> 28:35.197
Oh, my God!

28:36.400 --> 28:37.914
Jesus Christ! What the hell is that?

28:38.000 --> 28:38.990
What is that?

28:39.080 --> 28:40.355
What is that?

28:47.560 --> 28:48.550
Oh, my God.

28:52.840 --> 28:53.796
Shit!

28:53.880 --> 28:55.553
No! Quiet! Quiet!

28:55.640 --> 28:57.871
Stop! Stop!

28:59.680 --> 29:01.876
Hey! Hey!

29:01.960 --> 29:03.314
Hey, come back. Come back.

29:03.400 --> 29:05.960
Come back!

29:06.640 --> 29:08.950
God, no!

29:11.280 --> 29:12.430
Oh, God!

29:18.240 --> 29:19.720
Oh, God.

29:32.200 --> 29:33.190
Oh, God.

29:53.640 --> 29:54.596
Alex?

30:02.600 --> 30:03.431
Hey!

30:06.000 --> 30:07.992
- What happened?
- It was a cougar.

30:08.080 --> 30:09.196
Can you help him?

30:09.280 --> 30:11.272
- God. Jesus.
- Oh, wow.

30:11.360 --> 30:14.717
Okay. All right. Okay.

30:16.200 --> 30:19.591
Easy, easy, easy.
It's okay. It's okay. It's okay.

30:20.880 --> 30:22.678
- You okay?
- I'm okay.

30:22.760 --> 30:24.513
- How did he get in here?
- No, I...

30:24.600 --> 30:26.080
Well, he did... he didn't get in.

30:26.160 --> 30:28.436
I-I... yeah, I got the...

30:28.520 --> 30:30.398
- I grabbed the flare.
- Flare?

30:30.480 --> 30:31.880
- Yeah.
- Okay.

30:31.960 --> 30:33.394
- This boy almost got it.
- Wait.

30:33.480 --> 30:35.756
- You really shot that cougar with a flare?
- Uh-huh.

30:49.320 --> 30:50.720
Did you check your phone?

30:54.400 --> 30:55.629
There's nothing.

31:08.320 --> 31:09.754
What's your wife's name?

31:21.160 --> 31:22.230
Sarah.

31:26.120 --> 31:27.520
I hope I get to meet her.

31:28.920 --> 31:30.593
She must be so worried about you.

31:34.600 --> 31:35.829
Oh, God.

31:38.640 --> 31:40.233
Do you have kids?

31:45.720 --> 31:46.710
No.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.512
Don't eat too quickly.

32:12.600 --> 32:14.398
Your stomach could cramp up.

32:20.520 --> 32:23.558
You know, that was a close one.

32:23.640 --> 32:25.552
That should last us for about 10 days...

32:25.640 --> 32:27.996
which is great, because we're stuck here.

32:29.880 --> 32:31.200
I was thinking...

32:34.280 --> 32:39.193
If we could get down low enough maybe
we could get enough signal on your phone.

32:39.280 --> 32:43.115
No. No, forget the phone. There's no signal.

32:43.200 --> 32:44.793
I think the search and rescue probably...

32:44.880 --> 32:46.109
Well, they haven't found us yet, so...

32:46.200 --> 32:49.034
I know, but they're less likely
to find us if we leave here.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.713
They'll be focusing their search
on the beacon.

32:51.800 --> 32:53.029
Jesus Christ, Ben.

32:53.120 --> 32:54.440
No, there's a system here, Alex.

32:54.520 --> 32:57.035
Yeah, systems fail all the time.

32:58.360 --> 32:59.555
They haven't found us.

32:59.640 --> 33:01.313
We have to get going.

33:04.160 --> 33:06.038
You know, you wanted to wait. I waited.

33:06.120 --> 33:08.715
Alex, honestly, it's too dangerous, okay?

33:08.840 --> 33:10.559
I nearly fell off a cliff. Okay?

33:10.640 --> 33:12.472
I honestly nearly died.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.472
If we stay here, we're safe. If we leave...

33:14.560 --> 33:15.994
Look, I don't wanna die up here

33:16.080 --> 33:17.878
because you're too scared to take a risk.

33:17.960 --> 33:19.599
Hey, I'm not gonna fall off a mountain

33:19.680 --> 33:22.275
because you're reckless and selfish.

33:22.360 --> 33:23.476
What?

33:24.280 --> 33:26.715
You know what? You're absolutely right.

33:26.800 --> 33:28.519
You did get me into this.

33:34.520 --> 33:36.000
I was trying to be nice.

33:36.080 --> 33:38.356
- Wait a second. No.
- I was trying to help!

33:38.440 --> 33:40.909
- I was trying to help you.
- No. Hold on a second.

33:41.000 --> 33:42.559
You weren't trying to help me.

33:42.640 --> 33:44.632
You know, I could be married by now.

33:44.720 --> 33:45.870
Do you ever think about that?

33:46.000 --> 33:47.593
Is that what we're talking about?
Your ceremony?

33:47.680 --> 33:48.591
My God, poor Mark!

33:48.680 --> 33:51.195
What about my patient? You think about that?

33:51.280 --> 33:52.873
Yeah? Do you think about my patient?

33:52.960 --> 33:54.917
Don't blame me for your fucking problems,

33:55.000 --> 33:56.912
'cause if it wasn't for me, you'd be dead.

33:57.720 --> 34:00.076
You're the lucky one.

34:00.160 --> 34:02.834
Unlike me. I'm stuck with you.

34:04.640 --> 34:06.074
I would've had a much better chance

34:06.160 --> 34:08.469
if I didn't have you around, honestly.

34:30.960 --> 34:32.713
Okay.

34:32.840 --> 34:34.194
Let's go.

34:37.120 --> 34:38.873
He's probably gonna eat you, anyway.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.869
We'll find something. Just keep walking.

35:08.040 --> 35:09.394
Alex!

35:34.520 --> 35:35.510
No.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.036
Okay.

36:05.480 --> 36:06.880
Hey.

36:06.960 --> 36:08.314
Smile.

38:08.240 --> 38:09.230
Don't give up.

38:10.280 --> 38:11.396
Don't give up.

38:31.840 --> 38:32.830
Alex!

38:36.200 --> 38:37.190
Alex!

38:40.720 --> 38:42.359
You could have said goodbye.

38:42.440 --> 38:43.510
I had to try.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.600
I had to try my way.

38:46.720 --> 38:51.158
I'm just so glad I found you.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.469
Me too.

38:56.720 --> 38:57.676
So...

38:58.680 --> 39:00.080
do we go back?

39:00.960 --> 39:02.519
No, we wouldn't make it back.

39:03.240 --> 39:04.754
We have to get down to the tree line.

39:06.320 --> 39:07.993
- Keep moving.
- Okay.

39:08.080 --> 39:09.230
Okay.

39:10.360 --> 39:12.397
Tell me something. Tell me something.

39:12.480 --> 39:13.596
What?

39:15.360 --> 39:16.555
Tell me about your wedding.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.514
My wedding?

39:19.600 --> 39:20.716
Yeah.

39:20.800 --> 39:21.916
Didn't you hear?

39:23.200 --> 39:24.316
I missed it.

39:26.120 --> 39:27.076
Yeah.

39:27.160 --> 39:30.756
No... can't talk. You tell me something.

39:30.840 --> 39:33.036
Tell me, what...

39:33.120 --> 39:35.157
what kind of a doctor are you?

39:36.120 --> 39:37.713
- Oh.
- Um...

39:39.560 --> 39:40.914
I'm a neurosurgeon.

39:41.000 --> 39:43.276
Oh, yeah? Yes.

39:44.360 --> 39:46.875
Yeah. Brains. Why brains?

39:46.960 --> 39:49.429
It's an intense responsibility,
you know, to...

39:50.600 --> 39:52.637
cut into someone's brain.

39:54.880 --> 39:58.191
It's where their perceptions are...

39:59.880 --> 40:01.155
their intelligence...

40:02.000 --> 40:03.150
their emotion.

40:04.360 --> 40:05.714
What about the heart?

40:06.560 --> 40:08.438
Huh?

40:08.520 --> 40:10.716
The heart's nothing but a muscle.

40:24.280 --> 40:25.555
That's it, boy.

40:25.640 --> 40:28.109
We made it to the tree line.

40:28.200 --> 40:30.032
Let's find shelter.

41:02.960 --> 41:04.633
I think something's here.

41:04.720 --> 41:05.949
This cave will work.

41:07.440 --> 41:08.510
Come on.

41:14.360 --> 41:16.079
Yeah. Yeah.

41:17.000 --> 41:18.354
- Here.
- Ah.

41:18.440 --> 41:19.317
I know.

41:20.800 --> 41:22.154
Oh, jeez. It's freezing.

41:22.240 --> 41:24.516
Quite a bit of swelling there.

41:24.600 --> 41:27.195
- Any better?
- Yeah. That does look better.

41:27.280 --> 41:29.920
- Look at that bandage.
- Yeah.

41:33.360 --> 41:34.953
It's holding up actually.

41:38.880 --> 41:40.314
Hey, you know what would be funny?

41:41.680 --> 41:43.000
If you weren't really a doctor.

41:43.080 --> 41:44.799
Why would that be funny?

41:44.880 --> 41:49.477
Well, you'd just be doing all this
so you could see my fancy underwear.

41:51.960 --> 41:53.553
They're not that fancy.

41:55.480 --> 41:57.790
All right.

42:03.320 --> 42:04.390
Thank you.

42:04.480 --> 42:05.596
It's okay.

42:14.760 --> 42:16.080
Where's your gloves?

42:16.160 --> 42:17.879
God, Jesus.

42:17.960 --> 42:19.280
Shit, you're freezing.

42:19.360 --> 42:20.350
Here, come on.

42:23.200 --> 42:24.350
There.

42:26.520 --> 42:27.476
Better?

42:41.240 --> 42:42.799
I owe you an apology.

42:45.440 --> 42:47.193
I did find that beacon.

42:49.160 --> 42:50.594
I saw it.

42:51.560 --> 42:52.755
It was smashed to pieces.

43:01.520 --> 43:04.160
No, you didn't know that
when you came looking for me, did you?

43:09.000 --> 43:10.400
I think we should stay together.

43:11.120 --> 43:12.236
I mean...

43:13.280 --> 43:14.680
stick together.

43:14.760 --> 43:16.319
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah.

43:18.680 --> 43:20.433
It's the best chance we have at survival.

43:20.520 --> 43:22.000
I know, I'm sorry.

43:23.280 --> 43:25.920
Jeez, I'm sorry... for all of it.

43:28.560 --> 43:31.758
I'm only telling you 'cause I don't
wanna be left on this mountain by myself.

43:39.760 --> 43:41.194
Me neither.

43:53.240 --> 43:54.640
You wouldn't eat me, would you, boy?

44:00.240 --> 44:01.640
Alex.

44:06.480 --> 44:07.960
You were talking in your sleep.

44:08.080 --> 44:11.391
Yeah, I forgot to say, "I love you."

44:11.480 --> 44:14.712
- Who?
- I didn't say, "I love you," to Mark...

44:14.800 --> 44:18.396
- Oh.
- ...when I talked to him from the airport.

44:18.480 --> 44:22.076
You know, at the end of the call,
you know, always say, "I love you."

44:22.160 --> 44:23.992
He knows.

44:24.080 --> 44:25.480
Of course he does.

44:36.160 --> 44:37.230
Thank you.

45:25.840 --> 45:27.797
I'm gonna take a look around.

45:30.280 --> 45:31.953
You want coffee?

46:05.240 --> 46:06.799
Well, I can't see anything now.

46:08.720 --> 46:10.632
A little lower than that, I think. It's...

46:16.400 --> 46:19.120
You know, it could have been anything...

46:19.200 --> 46:22.796
just sunlight reflecting off some ice, maybe.

46:23.560 --> 46:24.676
Or man-made.

46:25.640 --> 46:27.074
Huh?

46:27.160 --> 46:28.389
We should check it out, though.

46:29.560 --> 46:33.759
I mean, we only got three days left of food.

46:34.880 --> 46:35.916
Let me help you with that.

46:43.240 --> 46:44.674
Can I ask you something?

46:48.960 --> 46:50.792
How long have you been married?

46:53.440 --> 46:54.590
Why would you ask me that?

46:56.720 --> 46:59.076
- I'm only asking because...
- Because what?

47:02.600 --> 47:04.193
Well, you wear a wedding ring, but...

47:05.360 --> 47:07.591
but you don't talk about your wife.

47:12.960 --> 47:14.952
Let's try to find out what that was.

47:19.000 --> 47:20.798
Come on, buddy.

47:23.480 --> 47:25.472
Let's try to get there before it gets dark.

47:36.080 --> 47:37.480
All right?

47:37.560 --> 47:38.676
Yeah.

47:40.440 --> 47:42.591
That's it. Up, up, up.

47:43.800 --> 47:45.678
Good, good, good. Okay.

47:54.120 --> 47:55.600
Come on, boy. Let's go.

48:00.240 --> 48:01.720
I reckon we're...

48:02.760 --> 48:04.717
another thousand feet down.

48:04.800 --> 48:08.111
He hates his leash. I'm gonna let him go.

48:08.200 --> 48:10.954
Almost looks like he knows where he's going.

48:13.200 --> 48:14.793
I think he was safer on the leash.

48:16.160 --> 48:17.150
Come on.

48:17.240 --> 48:18.833
- Another hour...
- Okay, okay.

48:18.920 --> 48:20.195
...then we'll stop.

48:27.280 --> 48:29.033
Oh, shit.

48:31.520 --> 48:33.034
No, no, no!

48:34.480 --> 48:36.711
No! Damn it!

48:36.800 --> 48:38.553
This is impossible!

48:39.720 --> 48:41.313
We have to try and go back up, Alex.

48:42.480 --> 48:43.709
Find another way around this.

48:43.800 --> 48:47.191
Look, I can't go up, can I?

48:47.320 --> 48:49.516
There has to be a way down.

48:49.600 --> 48:51.910
No. We just gotta go back
and find another way.

48:52.000 --> 48:53.878
I think if we follow this path...

48:53.960 --> 48:57.237
Alex, we're not doing that.
We follow that path, and we... and we die.

48:57.320 --> 48:59.277
The last time you thought
you knew something, we ended up...

48:59.360 --> 49:00.840
What do you mean, the last time I thought?

49:00.920 --> 49:03.594
The last time I thought,
I was trusting my instincts, you know.

49:03.680 --> 49:05.478
- Alex. Calm down.
- I was trusting my gut, my heart.

49:05.560 --> 49:08.075
Just calm down, all right?
Let's just think about this logically.

49:08.160 --> 49:10.038
- There's no actual way...
- Stop!

49:13.080 --> 49:14.230
I'm scared.

49:15.440 --> 49:17.193
Okay? I'm scared.

49:20.240 --> 49:22.152
Admit that you're scared, too.

49:24.600 --> 49:25.829
Ben...

49:25.920 --> 49:28.594
do you actually know
what it means to be reckless?

49:28.680 --> 49:30.592
It means to abandon safety.

49:30.680 --> 49:32.433
- I know exactly what it means, Alex.
- And sometimes...

49:32.520 --> 49:36.591
- But right now...
- Right now, we don't have a choice, okay?

49:36.680 --> 49:41.835
Nobody knows where we are.

49:41.920 --> 49:44.151
You know, all we have is me and you.
That is it, Ben.

49:44.240 --> 49:46.232
I don't want to die! Okay?

49:46.320 --> 49:48.755
Tell me, Doctor, from your heart.

49:51.360 --> 49:54.478
Do you a... Do you actually think
we're gonna make it?

50:04.080 --> 50:05.070
No.

50:08.800 --> 50:10.917
My instinct tells me
that we're gonna die up here.

50:17.280 --> 50:18.760
But we do have a choice.

50:22.680 --> 50:24.239
And we're still alive.

51:10.480 --> 51:12.676
Here we go. There we go.

51:19.520 --> 51:20.920
We're both tired.

51:24.320 --> 51:25.310
Sorry.

51:27.880 --> 51:30.952
Just get on with it now, yeah?

51:31.040 --> 51:32.156
We just have to get on with it.

51:32.240 --> 51:33.230
Yeah.

51:37.880 --> 51:38.870
Okay.

51:44.600 --> 51:45.556
We must be...

51:47.240 --> 51:49.960
a couple of thousand feet downhill by now.

51:50.040 --> 51:53.556
Your phone.
We should check... We should check it.

51:54.520 --> 51:56.000
My phone.

52:02.440 --> 52:04.830
We should just see
how much juice you have left.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.719
There is no reception.

52:09.240 --> 52:11.311
Haven't got much battery left.

52:22.280 --> 52:24.272
You were listening to something.

52:25.800 --> 52:27.280
At the airport.

52:29.760 --> 52:30.637
Probably shouldn't...

52:30.720 --> 52:33.030
Could you just, for one minute,
please just...

52:34.080 --> 52:35.514
just give us one percent?

52:36.840 --> 52:38.638
Just one percent of something.

53:35.000 --> 53:36.992
Are we still headed
towards the flash you saw?

53:37.080 --> 53:39.800
Yeah. It's way down this way.

53:45.760 --> 53:47.831
I'm good. I'm good. I'm good.

53:50.240 --> 53:51.674
Just look how beautiful that is.

53:56.720 --> 53:58.359
I want you to take a picture of me.

53:59.640 --> 54:00.630
What?

54:01.960 --> 54:04.873
I want you to take a picture of me.

54:04.960 --> 54:06.314
If I'm gonna die...

54:07.640 --> 54:10.030
I want this to be my very last picture.

54:10.120 --> 54:12.396
- I can't.
- I want you to take it.

54:24.880 --> 54:26.075
How do I look?

54:31.240 --> 54:33.516
I was halfway through an assignment.

54:34.520 --> 54:36.079
Um...

54:38.320 --> 54:41.279
I got close to... to a group of girls.

54:42.280 --> 54:43.634
Guerrilla fighters.

54:43.720 --> 54:46.554
You know, they... they let me follow them.

54:46.640 --> 54:49.712
There was this one girl, she...

54:49.800 --> 54:52.599
she told me all about this boy she liked,

54:52.680 --> 54:54.956
and, you know...

54:56.760 --> 54:58.194
and I gave her my lipstick.

55:00.880 --> 55:01.916
Then...

55:06.440 --> 55:08.113
there was an explosion...

55:09.240 --> 55:10.640
and she...

55:12.200 --> 55:13.793
was badly injured.

55:16.360 --> 55:17.794
I was there.

55:21.080 --> 55:22.560
I went to help her.

55:23.640 --> 55:25.518
She was still breathing then, but...

55:26.360 --> 55:28.238
she was beyond hope.

55:31.360 --> 55:32.794
I...

55:34.000 --> 55:35.434
I went into my bag...

55:36.640 --> 55:40.554
to get out my... camera.

55:43.120 --> 55:44.839
She looked at me.

55:47.280 --> 55:49.158
I looked at her.

55:52.040 --> 55:54.271
I took her picture.

55:58.400 --> 56:00.471
And then she died.

56:09.720 --> 56:12.030
I can't take your picture. I'm sorry.

56:14.600 --> 56:16.239
We're not gonna die.

56:18.240 --> 56:19.833
Not today.

56:44.160 --> 56:45.276
Shit.

56:55.440 --> 56:57.159
Where are we going?

56:57.240 --> 56:58.310
We're alive.

56:59.720 --> 57:01.234
That's where we're going.

57:01.320 --> 57:03.198
We've been walking for three days.

57:03.280 --> 57:05.840
We haven't found anything.

57:05.920 --> 57:07.513
Let's hope this valley leads us there.

57:08.680 --> 57:10.353
Can we stop? For a minute?

57:10.440 --> 57:11.794
Yeah.

57:11.880 --> 57:12.870
That's it.

57:16.760 --> 57:17.876
- Jeez.
- You okay?

57:17.960 --> 57:18.996
Okay. Yeah.

57:20.160 --> 57:21.913
Just... Just put your leg up.

57:26.520 --> 57:28.239
- Okay?
- Yeah.

57:29.240 --> 57:31.880
How about an ice-cold drink?

57:32.920 --> 57:33.910
Sure.

57:35.120 --> 57:36.190
Thank you.

57:36.280 --> 57:37.873
How about some ice with that?

57:40.400 --> 57:41.595
You're funny.

57:41.680 --> 57:43.911
I am getting used to the cold, though.

57:44.000 --> 57:46.231
- Yeah.
- Which is weird.

57:46.320 --> 57:49.597
Yeah, well, your body...
your body's acclimatizing.

57:51.680 --> 57:53.990
It's quite ingenious, what God did.

57:56.320 --> 57:59.040
Your body sort of figures it out.

58:04.280 --> 58:05.509
Where's the dog?

58:05.600 --> 58:08.399
We can't call him 'cause
we don't know his name.

58:13.840 --> 58:16.150
You're going to ask me to go
look for the dog, aren't you?

58:20.640 --> 58:21.596
Yeah.

58:21.680 --> 58:24.070
Come on, man.

58:27.320 --> 58:28.800
Hey!

58:44.680 --> 58:46.672
Here, boy. What are you doing?

58:48.920 --> 58:50.195
What are you eating?

58:51.120 --> 58:52.679
Been holding out on us?

59:14.560 --> 59:15.550
Ben?

59:26.080 --> 59:27.719
Hello?

59:29.400 --> 59:30.800
Nobody here?

59:35.040 --> 59:36.440
Hey, Ben!

59:45.720 --> 59:46.756
Ben!

59:49.680 --> 59:50.511
Ben?

59:58.800 --> 01:00:01.110
Alex! Alex!

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:28.038
Ah! Come on!

01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:35.595
Come on!

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:39.870
Shit!

01:00:41.720 --> 01:00:42.631
Come on.

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:44.630
Alex!

01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:22.640
Okay.

01:02:11.440 --> 01:02:12.510
I'm scared.

01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.079
And if you don't wake up soon...

01:02:18.680 --> 01:02:20.751
I think I warmed you up too fast.

01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.393
You're severely dehydrated.

01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.675
<i>I found a syringe
of medicine for snake bites.</i>

01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:37.154
<i>Emptied it out
and jerry-rigged an IV of saline fluid.</i>

01:02:38.840 --> 01:02:41.150
<i>Now, it could go wrong, Alex.</i>

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.630
<i>Infection or something, but...</i>

01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:45.552
I think you'd want me to do this.

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:49.593
I know you would.

01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.600
You'd tell me trust my instincts
or something.

01:03:59.080 --> 01:04:00.434
- Ben.
- Alex.

01:04:06.200 --> 01:04:07.634
Did we get rescued?

01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:09.989
No.

01:04:10.080 --> 01:04:11.753
No, we didn't.

01:04:13.440 --> 01:04:14.794
Thank God you're back.

01:04:16.480 --> 01:04:18.472
This is that cabin you saw.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.351
Can you help me pee?

01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:24.398
I thought you'd never ask.

01:04:27.440 --> 01:04:29.511
You're gonna feel a bit dizzy.

01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.920
Okay.

01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:33.750
Okay.

01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:53.800
You should have some.

01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:58.433
I have.

01:05:12.520 --> 01:05:13.749
Thank you.

01:05:19.320 --> 01:05:20.515
Here.

01:05:37.720 --> 01:05:38.710
So...

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:41.672
So, tell me something.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:46.800
What else happened when I was away?

01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.554
Well, you didn't miss much.

01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.395
Snowdrifts are 10-feet deep.

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:57.040
I know, 'cause
I was nearly buried in it twice.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.917
But I did find two cans of soup.

01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:03.839
What happens now?

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.957
We just have to wait
for a break in the weather.

01:06:09.240 --> 01:06:11.391
Then at least we can see where we're going.

01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.997
Mmm.

01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.354
It's January.

01:06:22.200 --> 01:06:23.600
How long...

01:06:23.680 --> 01:06:26.115
How long can we survive on two cans of soup?

01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:28.796
Ben.

01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:31.560
We've been lost almost three weeks.

01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:33.994
Don't you wanna get home?

01:06:44.840 --> 01:06:46.354
I'll find a way.

01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:54.356
Hey!

01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:57.556
<i>Hey, Ben.</i>

01:07:58.560 --> 01:07:59.437
<i>Surprise.</i>

01:08:00.120 --> 01:08:01.520
Get it, boy!

01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:03.193
Grab that rabbit. Go on!

01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.953
Go on, boy!

01:08:06.560 --> 01:08:07.914
Where'd he go?

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.320
Get him!

01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:10.436
No.

01:08:11.440 --> 01:08:13.272
You got it. Come on.

01:08:13.400 --> 01:08:16.120
Did you get him? Huh? Dig!

01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:20.080
<i>I can't believe you left
your little recorder unattended.</i>

01:08:20.200 --> 01:08:22.999
<i>I know you like to keep control of things.</i>

01:08:24.640 --> 01:08:26.073
Okay.

01:08:26.160 --> 01:08:27.149
Come on.

01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:31.072
Ah! Bullshit!

01:08:34.439 --> 01:08:36.796
Okay, you tried.

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:39.031
<i>But I wanted you to have it for good.</i>

01:08:39.120 --> 01:08:40.634
<i>No matter how bad things have...</i>

01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.913
- I'm... I'm sorry. Um...
- What are you doing?

01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.116
What are you doing?

01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:52.475
- I... I shouldn't have done that, Ben.
- Jesus, Alex.

01:08:52.560 --> 01:08:54.392
- I'm really sorry.
- I turn my back for two minutes,

01:08:54.479 --> 01:08:56.073
and you go through all my stuff. Is that it?

01:08:57.600 --> 01:08:59.956
No, that's not it. That's not it.

01:09:01.760 --> 01:09:02.988
I just...

01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.518
We might die together.

01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.314
And I don't even know you.

01:09:11.399 --> 01:09:13.960
You wanna get to know me? Play it.

01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:18.990
Play it.

01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:32.559
<i>I'm happy that we've had
this time together...</i>

01:09:33.800 --> 01:09:35.712
<i>no matter how bad things have gotten.</i>

01:09:37.200 --> 01:09:39.874
<i>And I'm sorry that I'm leaving.</i>

01:09:40.800 --> 01:09:42.439
<i>I'll always love you.</i>

01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:44.477
<i>You just...</i>

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:47.314
<i>This is not something that you can control.</i>

01:09:47.399 --> 01:09:48.880
<i>Love you, bye.</i>

01:09:58.520 --> 01:10:01.194
I want you to know...

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:04.432
this was a really unfair way
of me trying to understand who you are.

01:10:05.560 --> 01:10:06.789
And I'm sorry.

01:10:10.480 --> 01:10:12.199
I haven't heard that message in...

01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:16.160
two years.

01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.834
I'm gonna go cut more wood.

01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:31.271
I'm not like you, Alex.
I still can't talk about it.

01:11:45.440 --> 01:11:47.397
Mmm.

01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:58.398
Morning.

01:15:00.320 --> 01:15:01.310
Morning.

01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:06.590
Ben...

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.909
I've been thinking.

01:15:11.720 --> 01:15:13.439
There has to be a road.

01:15:15.400 --> 01:15:17.073
We must be close to something.

01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:18.350
I'm trying...

01:15:19.600 --> 01:15:20.829
to find us a way.

01:15:25.800 --> 01:15:28.076
You'll make it faster if I stay here.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:32.438
I don't wanna leave you here.

01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.034
I might not even make it.

01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:35.793
But you have to.

01:15:36.800 --> 01:15:38.519
We can't just stay here.

01:15:46.440 --> 01:15:49.194
Alex, my wife didn't leave me
the way you think she did.

01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:56.754
We were married happily...

01:15:59.120 --> 01:16:00.759
for eight years.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.439
She got sick.

01:16:12.720 --> 01:16:14.120
A brain tumor.

01:16:17.280 --> 01:16:19.636
My wife became my patient.

01:16:25.880 --> 01:16:27.633
And I couldn't save her.

01:16:32.120 --> 01:16:33.156
She died.

01:16:40.920 --> 01:16:42.718
I'm so sorry.

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:52.317
Alex.

01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:55.951
You're coming with me.

01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:57.474
I'm gonna get you home.

01:18:58.480 --> 01:19:01.040
I'll slow you down.

01:19:01.120 --> 01:19:04.158
- I can't leave. Not without you.
- What?

01:19:35.360 --> 01:19:37.352
Oh!

01:19:40.080 --> 01:19:41.958
I can't. I'm sorry.

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:47.120
We're gonna get there.

01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:20.316
Alex!

01:22:24.720 --> 01:22:25.631
Alex.

01:22:26.640 --> 01:22:27.551
Alex.

01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:31.996
Come on. Come on. Please, please. Come on.

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:34.595
Come on. We're here. We're here. We're here.

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:35.915
Come on, come on.

01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.036
Alex.

01:22:50.280 --> 01:22:51.430
Alex, do you see that?

01:22:51.520 --> 01:22:52.840
- Yeah, I see.
- Alex.

01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:55.640
I see it. I see.

01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:03.554
Oh, God.

01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:27.870
Ben?

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:33.916
I know.

01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:36.389
Won't say anything.

01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:40.280
I won't say anything.

01:23:59.040 --> 01:24:00.474
Where's the dog?

01:24:04.080 --> 01:24:06.197
- He'll find us. Come on.
- Yeah.

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:13.075
Come here, boy!

01:24:20.720 --> 01:24:22.791
Walter's dog, come here!

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:25.349
Hey, buddy. Come here. What are you doing?

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:27.352
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa! No! Come here.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:28.760
Now! Now! Here!

01:24:29.760 --> 01:24:31.035
See what that is?

01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.396
We gotta go. Let's go. There you go.

01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:35.392
We need to get out of here.

01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:36.709
We're almost home.

01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:40.831
Ben?

01:24:40.920 --> 01:24:41.956
Alex!

01:24:44.200 --> 01:24:45.156
Ben!

01:24:47.840 --> 01:24:48.671
Ben?

01:24:51.520 --> 01:24:53.955
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:24:55.240 --> 01:24:56.754
- Jesus! Jesus.
- Alex.

01:24:56.840 --> 01:24:59.309
Jesus Christ. What... what are we gonna do?

01:25:04.920 --> 01:25:06.877
No! No! Alex. Alex!

01:25:06.960 --> 01:25:09.156
Please! No. No. Just...

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:11.157
Alex.

01:25:13.520 --> 01:25:15.159
Ah! Alex!

01:25:18.880 --> 01:25:21.440
Go get... Go get... Go get help.

01:25:21.520 --> 01:25:22.510
Okay.

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:26.310
Christ.

01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:47.475
Stop!

01:26:49.920 --> 01:26:51.240
Stop!

01:27:12.440 --> 01:27:13.430
Alex?

01:27:38.280 --> 01:27:39.634
Alex?

01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:43.717
We need a doctor in 111 immediately.

01:27:45.440 --> 01:27:46.476
Dr. Bass?

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:48.950
Yeah.

01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:12.510
Oh, Ben.

01:28:19.200 --> 01:28:20.156
Oh, my God.

01:28:20.240 --> 01:28:21.435
Oh, God.

01:28:25.160 --> 01:28:26.435
We made it.

01:28:27.520 --> 01:28:29.318
You... Can you believe it?

01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:37.114
Yeah.

01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:39.635
Your hands, let me see.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:41.677
- Look at your hands.
- I know. I won't be...

01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:43.513
I won't be knitting for a while.

01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:46.835
I feel alive.

01:28:48.320 --> 01:28:49.913
I feel alive because of you.

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:53.436
Yeah.

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:04.037
Oh. I want you to meet Mark.

01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:06.030
You're Mark.

01:29:06.120 --> 01:29:07.520
Yeah. Ben, right?

01:29:07.600 --> 01:29:08.556
Yeah.

01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:12.549
Oh, man.

01:29:12.640 --> 01:29:14.632
Yeah. I can't begin to...

01:29:15.760 --> 01:29:16.750
Thank you.

01:29:18.600 --> 01:29:19.556
Yeah.

01:29:22.280 --> 01:29:23.316
Yeah.

01:29:23.400 --> 01:29:25.471
- Yeah? Okay, babe?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:29:25.560 --> 01:29:26.880
So, this is Ben.

01:29:27.840 --> 01:29:29.513
Yeah, I know. I know.

01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:32.479
Wow, it's Mark. Good. It's good to, uh...

01:29:32.560 --> 01:29:34.233
it's good to meet you.

01:29:34.320 --> 01:29:35.959
Alex told me how you saved her life.

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:38.555
Yes. No.

01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:42.069
No, you saved my life, Alex.

01:29:42.160 --> 01:29:43.992
- Ben. Ben.
- Um...

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.320
It's true.

01:29:47.560 --> 01:29:48.550
Yeah.

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:03.230
Um...

01:30:04.280 --> 01:30:06.556
They're chasing me. I need to go back, okay?

01:30:08.200 --> 01:30:09.554
All right.

01:30:12.960 --> 01:30:15.156
Careful. Here you go.

01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:11.036
Come here. Come here.

01:31:11.120 --> 01:31:12.952
Come here.

01:31:13.040 --> 01:31:14.679
Go on.

01:31:22.440 --> 01:31:25.319
Mrs. Qabbani, how are you?

01:31:25.400 --> 01:31:27.869
Are you feeling better?
How is your arm? Let me see.

01:31:30.760 --> 01:31:33.480
<i>We're really serious
about this type of criminality.</i>

01:31:33.560 --> 01:31:36.280
<i>Yes, but in the end, that won't matter,</i>

01:31:36.360 --> 01:31:40.240
<i>for the public and businesses
when shopping online.</i>

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:43.950
<i>Retailers are highly impacted
by retail crime.</i>

01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:48.080
<i>And we estimated cost to be
somewhere around 1.3 billion pounds,</i>

01:31:48.160 --> 01:31:50.595
<i>which will impact everyone, including...</i>

01:32:13.560 --> 01:32:15.711
- Don't leave me.
- I'm not.

01:32:15.840 --> 01:32:18.071
It's our party, you know?

01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:19.389
I know, but, you know.

01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:20.994
- Honey...
- I don't wanna be...

01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:23.356
I just don't wanna be by myself.

01:32:23.440 --> 01:32:25.272
These are our friends to welcome you.

01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.311
Everybody okay?
You all have drinks? Need anything?

01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:31.119
Could use a little ice,
actually, if you don't mind.

01:32:31.200 --> 01:32:32.316
Oh, that's really funny.

01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.514
Oh, Pam! Hi! How are you?

01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:37.478
- I'm fine, dear.
- Great to see you.

01:32:37.560 --> 01:32:39.995
Look at you. You look wonderful.

01:32:40.080 --> 01:32:42.197
- Oh, thank you.
- You know,

01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:45.273
I don't want to pry, I don't want
to be inappropriate,

01:32:45.360 --> 01:32:48.558
but I'm sure that you took some pictures
during your ordeal.

01:32:48.640 --> 01:32:50.518
Oh. Um...

01:32:50.600 --> 01:32:52.671
This is an amazing story,

01:32:52.760 --> 01:32:55.514
and I expect those photos are amazing, too.

01:32:55.600 --> 01:32:58.479
I really think people would like to see them.

01:32:58.560 --> 01:33:00.040
Well, I...

01:33:00.120 --> 01:33:01.713
You know, Pam, I'm not really...

01:33:01.800 --> 01:33:03.632
I'm not really ready for that.

01:33:03.720 --> 01:33:06.110
- Will you think about it?
- Yeah, sure. Yeah.

01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:07.680
Yeah. I'll think about it.

01:33:56.120 --> 01:33:57.156
Hi, Ben.

01:33:58.160 --> 01:33:59.230
It's Alex again.

01:34:01.880 --> 01:34:03.633
Just calling to say hi.

01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:07.916
Try me back.

01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:15.554
Tell you what. We'll skip out early,
you know, once the thing's over.

01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:17.393
We can leave before the reception.

01:34:20.600 --> 01:34:21.477
Hey.

01:34:21.560 --> 01:34:22.550
What?

01:34:26.160 --> 01:34:27.150
It's all right.

01:34:28.840 --> 01:34:30.069
- Was... did you...
- Yeah, no.

01:34:30.160 --> 01:34:32.834
I was just talking about the fund-raisers.

01:34:34.320 --> 01:34:35.720
Oh, I'm sorry.

01:34:37.400 --> 01:34:38.516
Sorry.

01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:45.037
Alex, I...

01:34:45.120 --> 01:34:47.840
I get that you haven't wanted
to talk about this...

01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:53.997
but... I... I know what I'm in with you.

01:34:55.160 --> 01:34:57.800
I always told myself I'd...

01:34:57.920 --> 01:35:00.913
I'd get some call from somewhere.

01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:05.832
So, I made a deal with myself.

01:35:11.720 --> 01:35:14.110
That I would always love you,

01:35:14.200 --> 01:35:16.715
even if you came home missing
a piece of yourself.

01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:40.320
Hello?

01:38:56.320 --> 01:38:59.711
Hi. I'm sorry I'm later than I...

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.359
You look brand-new.

01:39:01.440 --> 01:39:03.079
- Oh, so... so do you.
- How are you?

01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:04.196
Yeah. Good.

01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:06.830
Sit down.

01:39:10.640 --> 01:39:12.233
Can I get you something to drink?

01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:14.471
Oh, no. Just water's fine, thanks.

01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:18.989
So, how are you?

01:39:22.120 --> 01:39:23.031
How's your leg?

01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:25.470
How's yours?

01:39:25.560 --> 01:39:27.199
Yeah.

01:39:27.280 --> 01:39:29.840
I can't run, but I get by.

01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:32.956
I kept the dog.

01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.440
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

01:39:34.520 --> 01:39:35.715
So what'd you call him?

01:39:35.800 --> 01:39:37.757
Um... dog.

01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:39.513
- He still...
- No.

01:39:39.600 --> 01:39:40.875
He still doesn't have a name.

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:45.920
You look... You look...

01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:47.872
You look beautiful, Alex.

01:39:49.320 --> 01:39:50.390
Thank you.

01:39:52.240 --> 01:39:53.356
How is everything?

01:39:53.440 --> 01:39:54.590
Um, good.

01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:57.832
I'm working with people more.

01:39:59.680 --> 01:40:02.479
Post-trauma patients,
you know, the extreme cases.

01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:04.831
I sort of float between a NHS clinic

01:40:04.920 --> 01:40:08.834
and a rehabilitation center
in South London, where I live now.

01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:11.276
- It's good to be home.
- No more surgery?

01:40:11.400 --> 01:40:14.199
No. No, I can't do that anymore.

01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:21.400
And you? How are you?

01:40:21.480 --> 01:40:22.960
I'm okay, too. Yeah.

01:40:23.040 --> 01:40:25.600
I... I came home and...

01:40:27.360 --> 01:40:29.556
everything had shifted, but...

01:40:29.640 --> 01:40:31.677
I kind of had to wait it out, but it's okay.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.593
No more conflict zones.

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:39.358
And the last thing
I feel like doing is getting on a plane.

01:40:41.080 --> 01:40:44.118
So I'm teaching now, part-time,

01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:46.078
staying closer to home.

01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:47.674
Yeah.

01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.519
How was it? How was the wedding?

01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:52.756
Oh. We didn't have one.

01:40:54.400 --> 01:40:55.390
What?

01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:58.675
What? You didn't...

01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:01.310
No.

01:41:06.160 --> 01:41:07.389
I couldn't.

01:41:09.160 --> 01:41:11.629
Mark is a really wonderful man, but...

01:41:14.880 --> 01:41:16.109
but I...

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:18.909
I couldn't.

01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:23.517
I'm really sorry, Alex. That's...

01:41:26.520 --> 01:41:28.273
Why didn't you tell me?

01:41:29.960 --> 01:41:32.520
You're not that great
at picking up the phone.

01:41:32.600 --> 01:41:33.954
Are you guys hungry?

01:41:34.040 --> 01:41:35.076
- No.
- No.

01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:53.710
I didn't pick up my phone
'cause I thought you were married, Alex.

01:41:53.800 --> 01:41:55.359
I thought you were married.

01:41:55.440 --> 01:41:57.159
You could have called back.

01:42:02.400 --> 01:42:05.199
It was hard enough for me to lose Sarah.

01:42:08.240 --> 01:42:11.392
I struggled with the idea of losing you, too.

01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.560
And then when you sent those photographs...

01:42:15.640 --> 01:42:18.917
I, uh... I felt alive.

01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:20.434
I really did. I...

01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.755
We made it, you and I.

01:42:27.680 --> 01:42:28.875
And I had to see you.

01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:33.071
I loved you on that mountain.

01:42:37.400 --> 01:42:39.392
I tried to pretend that I didn't, but I did.

01:42:41.280 --> 01:42:43.795
I came home and nothing was the same.

01:42:45.840 --> 01:42:48.036
And then I tried to reach you, and it...

01:42:49.160 --> 01:42:50.560
it was so...

01:42:53.240 --> 01:42:54.959
It was just too painful.

01:42:56.320 --> 01:42:57.674
So I had to...

01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:00.518
make myself accept

01:43:00.600 --> 01:43:04.310
that maybe it wasn't real,
and it would never work,

01:43:04.400 --> 01:43:05.914
not in real life.

01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:10.399
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:18.312
There's a moment for these things,
and then it... it passes.

01:43:33.560 --> 01:43:34.710
Hey, so...

01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:39.475
Could you... Could you give the dog a name?

01:43:40.600 --> 01:43:42.034
He kind of deserves it.

01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:46.520
I think you're wrong, Alex.

01:43:48.400 --> 01:43:50.357
I think we survived because we fell in love.

01:43:53.360 --> 01:43:56.194
Up there it was just...
it was just me and you.

01:43:58.400 --> 01:43:59.800
The world is bigger than that.

01:44:02.600 --> 01:44:04.398
And the heart is just a muscle.

01:44:05.680 --> 01:44:06.591
Right?

01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:10.474
What idiot said that?

01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:28.511
