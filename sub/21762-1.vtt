Previously on  All Hail King Julien.

00:44.043 --> 00:48.674
Our plucky hero is missing, presumed dead,
after driving the Mega-Gecko Aspire

00:48.757 --> 00:50.175
out to sea where it exploded.

00:50.300 --> 00:51.510
-[Julien] Guys!
-[all] No!

00:51.635 --> 00:57.432
Poor Maurice, Clover and Mort
have just got to find their beloved king.

00:57.516 --> 00:58.433
And Ted...

00:58.517 --> 01:01.102
Well, Ted's lost his favorite sock.

01:01.186 --> 01:03.271
Where the heck is that sock?

01:11.613 --> 01:12.447
[Clover] Hmm?

01:12.573 --> 01:14.449
[all yelling in panic]

01:18.495 --> 01:19.955
It's mine!

01:20.039 --> 01:21.373
Got my spit on it!

01:21.456 --> 01:23.250
[Mort grunting]

01:23.834 --> 01:25.002
[Maurice sputtering]

01:25.126 --> 01:26.670
Mort, what are you doing?

01:26.754 --> 01:29.882
I'm hoarding! Everybody's doing it.

01:30.007 --> 01:31.675
-What?
-[all yelling]

01:31.800 --> 01:32.718
Why?

01:32.801 --> 01:34.720
Since the mango harvest is canceled,

01:34.803 --> 01:37.222
there won't be enough mangoes
for everyone.

01:37.305 --> 01:40.099
Who said anything about
canceling the mango harvest?

01:40.183 --> 01:42.644
We can't have the harvest
without King Julien!

01:42.728 --> 01:46.065
If he doesn't pick the first mango
and give it a royal blessing,

01:46.147 --> 01:50.569
Gladys, the goddess of fruits and grains,
will smite our land

01:50.652 --> 01:54.823
and we'll endure 100 years of hunger
and sadness!

01:54.907 --> 01:59.494
[sobbing]
Just like my life without King Julien.

02:00.537 --> 02:01.538
[thuds]

02:01.622 --> 02:04.458
Mmm, Gladys does have a tendency to smite.

02:04.541 --> 02:05.834
Maybe we don't need the harvest.

02:05.918 --> 02:08.336
Yeah, I'm sure we have
plenty of mangoes left.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.380
Nope. Crate's empty.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.716
-No more mangoes.
-Mango!

02:12.841 --> 02:13.884
Um...

02:13.968 --> 02:16.720
Wait a minute,
what about all those mangoes?

02:17.471 --> 02:18.847
I'm shipping those out.

02:18.931 --> 02:20.348
Shipping them where?

02:20.432 --> 02:23.184
The same faraway island
I send them every month.

02:23.268 --> 02:26.063
Uncle King Julien set it up
when he was king.

02:26.187 --> 02:27.731
[stuttering]
What? You do what now?

02:27.815 --> 02:29.984
Maurice, I found it! Come on!

02:30.067 --> 02:32.987
-[gasps]
-What do you want me to do with these?

02:33.070 --> 02:34.321
[Maurice]
Shipment's canceled!

02:34.404 --> 02:38.366
Shipment, schmipment, we still have
a mango shortage on our hands.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.868
[all yelling]

02:39.994 --> 02:43.580
[Timo] This is the flight recorder
I installed in the Mega Gecko's cockpit.

02:43.789 --> 02:47.501
It should tell us what happened
in King Julien's final moments.

02:47.626 --> 02:50.420
-[Julien singing]
-[Clover gasps]

02:50.545 --> 02:52.255
Oh! King Julien?

02:52.756 --> 02:54.257
King Julien!

02:54.382 --> 02:55.676
[Julien continues singing]

02:56.384 --> 02:59.638
[gasps]
King Julien's in this tiny box!

02:59.721 --> 03:01.180
[Julien sings louder]

03:01.264 --> 03:04.309
Hold on, King Julien! I'll get you out!

03:04.392 --> 03:05.811
No, Mort, stop!

03:05.894 --> 03:06.812
Let me go!

03:06.895 --> 03:08.814
King Julien's not in there.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.440
[woman's voice]
Fifteen seconds.

03:10.524 --> 03:11.984
[Julien]
Fifteen seconds?

03:12.442 --> 03:13.443
[Julien sobs]

03:13.568 --> 03:16.446
[Julien]
This is it. Goodbye, me.

03:16.530 --> 03:21.200
Wow, my brain is having all sorts
of near-death wisdom thoughts.

03:21.284 --> 03:24.038
If only I were being recorded right now,

03:24.121 --> 03:27.791
I would tell everyone the really
important thing I just realized.

03:28.375 --> 03:31.336
All you need is... Ooh.

03:31.461 --> 03:34.006
Is that an ejection button?
Let me just...

03:34.089 --> 03:35.382
[Julien screams]

03:35.465 --> 03:36.591
[splashes]

03:36.675 --> 03:38.635
-He got out!
-King Julien's alive!

03:38.719 --> 03:39.678
-[Mort] Oh!
-[Clover] Huh?

03:39.803 --> 03:42.639
[Mort] I knew it! I knew he couldn't die!

03:42.723 --> 03:46.267
My King Julien's alive! Alive!

03:47.144 --> 03:51.773
[laughs] Not only is he alive,
but I know how to find him!

03:52.774 --> 03:54.568
Data's uploading now.

03:54.651 --> 03:58.906
Four and three, carry the... Bingo!

03:58.989 --> 04:01.075
According to my calculations,

04:01.158 --> 04:04.036
you will find King Julien right here!

04:04.912 --> 04:08.165
That settles it. I'll set sail on the
S.S. Peepee Pants immediately.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.709
It's the only way to cover that much area.

04:11.877 --> 04:13.253
[Julien groaning]

04:14.254 --> 04:15.380
Ah!

04:18.008 --> 04:22.429
Okay, I'm on a pirate ship
in the middle of nowhere!

04:22.512 --> 04:23.471
Ah!

04:23.555 --> 04:26.474
This is so not how
I wanted to spend my day.

04:26.600 --> 04:27.726
[men grunting and exclaiming]

04:34.816 --> 04:37.402
Nice work with the teeth there,
One-Leg Davy!

04:37.485 --> 04:39.238
[grunting and exclaiming continues]

04:42.157 --> 04:44.910
These pirates are a bunch
of dangerous freaks!

04:45.827 --> 04:47.246
[Captain]
Gather round! Trophy time!

04:47.328 --> 04:50.415
Trophies. Maybe I'm
all wrong about these guys.

04:50.498 --> 04:55.336
...the second month in a row,
our Most Valuable Plunderer award goes to

04:55.420 --> 04:56.838
One-Eyed Simon!

04:56.922 --> 04:59.091
Aw, shucks! Thanks, Captain.

04:59.174 --> 05:00.926
Well, you deserve it, Si.

05:01.009 --> 05:03.178
Showed some real hustle out there.

05:03.262 --> 05:07.515
As you know, on my ship,
everyone gets a trophy.

05:07.599 --> 05:10.811
I can't believe I was worried.
I'm sure they'll help me get home.

05:10.894 --> 05:15.649
The Most Likely to Need Improvement award
goes to Jimmy.

05:15.774 --> 05:18.485
Uh, it looks like an anchor.

05:18.610 --> 05:20.279
[laughing]

05:20.403 --> 05:22.614
It is an anchor, Jim. Hold on tight.

05:22.864 --> 05:23.949
[Jim] Wah-haa!

05:24.074 --> 05:25.033
Ah!

05:25.742 --> 05:26.910
[snaps fingers]

05:28.411 --> 05:29.830
[Julien gulps] Oh.

05:29.955 --> 05:32.624
[laughs] Ahoy there!

05:32.749 --> 05:34.042
[Julien] Ah!

05:34.709 --> 05:37.587
Welcome! This is my ship,
The Bonny Bonnie.

05:37.671 --> 05:39.422
I'm Captain Ethan the Gassy.

05:39.506 --> 05:40.924
Oh, this here's my crew.

05:41.008 --> 05:43.260
Lil Arms Magee, One-Eyed Simon,

05:43.342 --> 05:44.886
And No-Name Jack.

05:44.970 --> 05:49.224
Thanks, Captain, for rescuing me and all.
Totally appreciate it.

05:49.308 --> 05:51.350
Now, if you could direct me
to the nearest lifeboat,

05:51.434 --> 05:52.519
I'll just be on my way.

05:52.644 --> 05:53.979
[all laughing]

05:54.104 --> 05:55.814
[laughing uncertainly]

05:59.276 --> 06:03.280
No, we didn't rescue you, we captured you.

06:03.362 --> 06:08.076
Uh, unfortunately, I don't think I can fit
"being a hostage" into my schedule today.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.661
I'm pretty slammed.

06:09.744 --> 06:11.038
No problem, buddy!

06:11.121 --> 06:15.250
We just had an opening in our cabin boy
department and guess what, you're hired!

06:15.334 --> 06:16.877
That's great.

06:16.960 --> 06:18.377
-Well done!
-Wow.

06:18.461 --> 06:19.921
[Magee]
We knew you could do it!

06:20.005 --> 06:21.715
Thanks. [chuckles]

06:21.798 --> 06:24.218
Aw, gee, I don't know what to-- See you!

06:24.301 --> 06:25.426
[Julien yelling]

06:27.346 --> 06:29.056
We've got a swimmer!

06:29.181 --> 06:30.307
[Julien sputtering]

06:30.389 --> 06:31.892
Come on, guys! After him!

06:31.975 --> 06:34.895
Whoever catches him gets
an extra dollop of gruel with dinner.

06:34.978 --> 06:36.688
[Julien crying]

06:36.771 --> 06:38.773
[Julien yelling]

06:38.899 --> 06:41.318
[sighs] And a trophy.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.284
Thanks, but what are you gonna do
about the mango shortage?

06:49.368 --> 06:51.161
I'm sure Gladys will understand

06:51.245 --> 06:53.663
if we don't have
a royal blessing just this once.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.001
Snap out of it, Maurice!
You know better than to anger Gladys!

06:58.085 --> 07:00.587
The kingdom can't take that kind of wrath.
[shudders]

07:00.670 --> 07:02.381
[indistinct chatter]

07:02.505 --> 07:04.007
[lemur 1] It just couldn't be.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.051
-[lemur 2] Oh, my gosh!
-King Julien?

07:06.134 --> 07:08.053
[lemur 3]
Now that's what I call exciting.

07:08.136 --> 07:11.014
-[Willie] Got my spit on it!
-[Horst] Unhand that mango!

07:11.098 --> 07:12.849
No, it's mine!

07:14.851 --> 07:17.062
-Who are they?
-I can't believe it.

07:17.145 --> 07:19.606
[Maurice]
It's Princess Julienne and Prince Barty.

07:19.689 --> 07:21.400
King Julien's parents!

07:21.482 --> 07:24.361
Ugh, I forgot how ugly they all are.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.406
Barty, please tell me you brought
your travel scepter?

07:27.488 --> 07:30.450
I can't risk one of their filthy hands
touching me.

07:30.533 --> 07:33.370
Oh, I left the travel scepter back
at the condo.

07:33.453 --> 07:35.997
Blazes! Why did I pack so lightly?

07:36.081 --> 07:37.416
Close your eyes, dear.

07:37.498 --> 07:40.419
Remember, what we can't see doesn't exist.

07:41.711 --> 07:43.546
Mine! I saw it first!

07:43.630 --> 07:45.924
-[all yelling]
-But I thought they were dead.

07:46.007 --> 07:47.050
I wish.

07:47.717 --> 07:50.762
You'll have to excuse our surprise,
Your Majesties.

07:50.845 --> 07:52.722
We thought you were dead.

07:52.806 --> 07:55.058
Barty, why is it talking to us?

07:55.142 --> 07:56.893
Perhaps it wants something.

07:57.185 --> 07:59.771
[loudly]
Do you require food?

08:00.521 --> 08:01.648
Ah.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.443
Okay, so...

08:04.525 --> 08:06.861
As you clearly don't remember,

08:06.945 --> 08:10.324
I'm Maurice, King Julien's royal advisor,

08:10.407 --> 08:12.533
and may I introduce Clover?

08:12.617 --> 08:15.245
[sniffing] Good heavens.
What is that appalling smell?

08:16.246 --> 08:17.289
[sniffing]

08:17.414 --> 08:20.208
Yuck! It smells like foosa droppings.

08:21.042 --> 08:23.586
[loudly]
Did I step in foosa droppings?

08:23.670 --> 08:27.882
I need to know,
and you're the only one down there.

08:27.966 --> 08:30.593
Anyway, it's, uh, nice to see you again.

08:30.677 --> 08:33.763
Though, I wish it wasn't under
these sad circumstances.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.141
Yes, it is rather unfortunate.

08:36.224 --> 08:38.726
And entirely inconvenient, I might add.

08:38.810 --> 08:40.145
Without our monthly allowance--

08:40.228 --> 08:41.313
[both] Monthly what?

08:41.396 --> 08:43.690
You're referring to our mangoes?

08:45.608 --> 08:48.236
[loudly]
Mangoes! It's a fruit!

08:49.070 --> 08:53.116
Wait. The monthly shipment of mangoes.
It goes to you?

08:53.200 --> 08:54.117
Of course.

08:54.201 --> 08:58.038
What other sad circumstances
could you possibly be referring to?

08:58.121 --> 08:59.664
Um, your son!

08:59.747 --> 09:02.083
Ah, yes, where is--

09:02.167 --> 09:05.837
Oh, my goodness, I've forgotten his name.
It begins with an "R"?

09:05.920 --> 09:08.965
No, no, no,
I think it starts with an "L," dear.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.425
Of course it does.

09:10.509 --> 09:12.386
L... Um... L...

09:12.469 --> 09:13.970
No, that's not right.

09:14.054 --> 09:15.680
Perhaps a silent "P."

09:15.805 --> 09:17.432
Pa-pa-pa, p-p-pa.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.642
Potatoes!

09:19.726 --> 09:22.645
King Julien has gone missing.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.899
Missing? Well, that is serious.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.609
But I don't see what it has to do
with our mangoes.

09:28.693 --> 09:29.694
[both] He's your son!

09:29.777 --> 09:32.864
Barty, what if our mangoes are with him?

09:32.947 --> 09:36.535
How could you talk about
a bunch of mangoes at a time like--

09:37.827 --> 09:39.371
How can they be so--

09:39.454 --> 09:41.039
-I just-- I wanna-- Grr!
-Shh.

09:41.122 --> 09:42.749
Da! Ha! Hyah!

09:42.874 --> 09:46.545
I know. But remember, they're not
like you and me. They're royalty.

09:46.627 --> 09:48.588
-[echoing]
-Huh?

09:48.671 --> 09:52.342
Just tell them we don't have any mangoes
so they'll go away!

09:52.426 --> 09:56.179
Hold on. What's she going on
about no mangoes?

09:56.263 --> 09:58.265
It's true. We're running low.

09:58.348 --> 10:01.601
But luckily, it's harvest time,
which is why we need your help.

10:02.102 --> 10:04.104
-Hmm?
-Help?

10:04.187 --> 10:05.855
[both laughing]

10:08.983 --> 10:11.945
Do we look like a pair of farmers to you?

10:12.028 --> 10:14.281
[continue laughing]

10:14.406 --> 10:15.240
Farmers!

10:15.365 --> 10:17.451
-[Barty] Good fun! Good fun!
-[Julienne laughing]

10:17.534 --> 10:19.327
You're a pair of something, all right.

10:20.954 --> 10:24.416
Royals. A pair of royals.
Which is just what we need.

10:24.958 --> 10:25.959
Give it to me!

10:26.042 --> 10:27.085
It's mine.

10:27.168 --> 10:30.880
Don't worry, Maurice.
We'll find King Julien and bring him home.

10:31.839 --> 10:32.882
[lemur] It's my mango!

10:32.966 --> 10:34.551
Please hurry.

10:37.596 --> 10:38.805
Listen up, everyone!

10:38.888 --> 10:41.141
Hey! Stop fighting and listen!

10:41.224 --> 10:42.225
[whistles]

10:44.852 --> 10:45.728
[grunts]

10:45.812 --> 10:47.481
I've got good news.

10:47.564 --> 10:50.484
This is Princess Julienne
and Prince Barty,

10:50.567 --> 10:51.859
King Julien's parents.

10:51.943 --> 10:54.737
They will be filling in
until King Julien returns.

10:54.821 --> 10:58.699
They will also be picking the first mango
and blessing our annual harvest,

10:58.783 --> 11:02.370
which means there will be
plenty of mangoes for everyone!

11:02.454 --> 11:04.581
[all cheering]

11:04.664 --> 11:08.293
And I have your word that
upon King Julien's return,

11:08.376 --> 11:12.130
our monthly allowance will be restored,
and we can be on our way?

11:12.839 --> 11:14.508
You have my word.

11:16.009 --> 11:19.429
How long do we have to keep moving
our arms like this?

11:19.513 --> 11:22.974
I don't want any of them to get the idea
we care about them.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.892
[cheering continues]

11:29.730 --> 11:30.982
[Julien muttering]

11:31.232 --> 11:32.984
[whimpering]

11:33.109 --> 11:34.653
Uh, hello?

11:34.735 --> 11:37.322
Is someone back there lurking
in the shadows?

11:37.405 --> 11:40.283
Because, not gonna lie,
you're freaking me out!

11:41.618 --> 11:43.161
Ah! [whimpering]

11:44.579 --> 11:46.122
Sage! Sage!

11:46.247 --> 11:49.125
[laughing] Boy, am I glad to see you!

11:49.209 --> 11:52.337
You see only the face that I present
to the world.

11:52.420 --> 11:53.630
Don't be fooled.

11:53.712 --> 11:56.675
It is but a mirage,
and you a thirsty nomad.

11:57.258 --> 11:59.052
-I am parched.
-[door unlocking]

11:59.636 --> 12:01.680
You two! Up on deck!

12:04.765 --> 12:05.600
[groans]

12:08.603 --> 12:10.480
Excuse me, Captain?

12:11.356 --> 12:14.317
Unfortunately, I have very delicate paws.

12:14.401 --> 12:15.734
See?

12:16.653 --> 12:19.406
Soft like a baby's bottom.

12:19.489 --> 12:23.993
So you can imagine, this whole swabbing
the deck thing isn't going to work.

12:24.077 --> 12:27.205
No problem,
you can empty the toilet buckets instead!

12:27.288 --> 12:30.250
Ah, I knew that you'd--
Empty the who's the what now?

12:31.084 --> 12:32.793
[coughing]

12:33.461 --> 12:35.004
[gagging]

12:35.880 --> 12:38.049
I've got to get off this ship.

12:38.132 --> 12:41.844
My peoples are lost without me!
Plus, it's harvest time.

12:41.928 --> 12:44.389
Who is going to bless all the mangoes?

12:44.472 --> 12:47.642
And more importantly,
this is really gross!

12:47.726 --> 12:49.143
I mean-- [gagging]

12:50.520 --> 12:51.979
Sage, are you listening?

12:52.063 --> 12:54.357
You'll have to ask my soul.

12:54.441 --> 12:56.817
It controls my body's answering machine.

12:56.901 --> 12:58.777
[heart beating]

12:58.903 --> 13:00.821
Leave a message at the heart beep.

13:01.448 --> 13:03.241
Control! [laughs]

13:03.324 --> 13:05.660
Sage, you brawny genius!

13:05.744 --> 13:06.661
You're right!

13:06.745 --> 13:10.373
The only way to get home
is to take control of this ship!

13:10.457 --> 13:14.461
With my brains and your muscly physique,
what could go wrong?

13:15.086 --> 13:16.337
[Julien] Oh! Ah!

13:16.463 --> 13:19.132
I hope this dish of wood chips, sea foam,
and my own spittle

13:19.215 --> 13:21.301
will nourish your bodies.

13:21.426 --> 13:23.637
[slurps] Ahh. Oh!

13:23.762 --> 13:26.889
I know who's getting the trophy
for best gruel!

13:26.973 --> 13:27.974
Hmm...

13:28.057 --> 13:32.479
Aw, man,
I really thought I had it this time.

13:33.271 --> 13:34.397
[Julien yells]

13:34.481 --> 13:38.735
Anyone else having an issue
with all this, ah, rocking?

13:38.817 --> 13:41.946
Ah! No? Okay, just me then. Ah!

13:42.739 --> 13:44.240
-[gurgling]
-[farts]

13:45.366 --> 13:49.203
No, false alarm. [chuckles]
Everybody can relax.

13:49.287 --> 13:51.164
I'm totally oka--

13:51.247 --> 13:53.082
[vomiting]

13:53.708 --> 13:56.252
Don't worry. It all went into my bucket.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.046
[Julien vomiting]

14:00.214 --> 14:03.426
Nope. Didn't catch it that time.
It went all over the-- Oh!

14:08.765 --> 14:12.893
Okay, I'm sure you both want to settle in
and you should probably rest up

14:12.977 --> 14:14.604
for the blessing of the mangoes,

14:14.688 --> 14:17.649
so I'm gonna go. Let me know
if you need anything. Bye!

14:17.732 --> 14:18.941
Huh?

14:19.066 --> 14:21.569
[loudly]
Get yourself something pretty.

14:22.153 --> 14:23.530
Thank you.

14:24.698 --> 14:25.657
[bell rings]

14:25.782 --> 14:27.701
-[Julienne] Mark!
-What the--

14:29.118 --> 14:30.495
[ringing]

14:30.620 --> 14:33.122
Little slow. Work on that.

14:37.627 --> 14:38.670
Right on course.

14:38.753 --> 14:41.715
We should be entering the blast radius
by morning.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.886
[whispering]
'Kay, just follow my lead.

14:47.011 --> 14:52.684
So, Sage, you hear the Captain talking
about that new super special trophy?

14:52.767 --> 14:54.519
What? A trophy?

14:54.644 --> 14:55.895
Oh, yeah.

14:55.978 --> 14:58.939
Word on the boat is,
it's like a million times better

14:59.023 --> 15:01.776
than all the other trophies combined.

15:01.860 --> 15:04.028
Really? How do we get it then?

15:04.111 --> 15:05.530
Pff, easy.

15:05.613 --> 15:10.034
The super special trophy will go to
whoever gives the Captain the best hug!

15:10.869 --> 15:11.911
Cor.

15:12.036 --> 15:13.913
Aw, what's wrong, buddy?

15:13.996 --> 15:16.875
[sobbing]
I'll never win with these arms.

15:16.999 --> 15:19.043
They're so tiny and useless.

15:19.168 --> 15:21.087
[crying loudly]

15:21.212 --> 15:22.255
Look!

15:22.338 --> 15:24.465
I can't even wipe me own tears!

15:25.759 --> 15:29.011
Come on now, don't talk
about yourself like that. Don't worry.

15:29.095 --> 15:32.098
It just so happens that where I come from,

15:32.181 --> 15:34.225
I'm a world champion hugger.

15:34.308 --> 15:38.229
Yep. Won 12 years in a row.
I could maybe coach you.

15:38.312 --> 15:39.439
You'd do that?

15:39.522 --> 15:41.107
Of course I would.

15:41.190 --> 15:44.402
After all, you've been
so good about capturing me,

15:44.485 --> 15:45.695
keeping me here against my will

15:45.779 --> 15:48.656
and making sure I'm locked up
in a cold, dank cell every night

15:48.740 --> 15:52.952
without food, water, or even a blanket.
It's the least I can do, buddy.

15:53.035 --> 15:54.788
Hmm? Hmm? Hmm? Come on!

15:55.705 --> 15:57.123
Bring it in.

15:57.206 --> 16:02.879
[clears throat] You see, the "key"
to a good hug is the back-patting.

16:02.962 --> 16:04.547
-Like so.
-[Magee] Oh, yeah.

16:04.631 --> 16:05.673
-[Julien] Sage!
-I like that. It's nice.

16:05.757 --> 16:08.760
Mm-hmm. Yeah.
[whispering] Sage! Sage!

16:08.885 --> 16:10.094
Here. What was that?

16:10.177 --> 16:11.846
Nothing. Now pay attention.

16:11.930 --> 16:15.558
The second "key" to a good hug
is body contact.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.393
Bring it in a little closer.

16:17.477 --> 16:20.187
You really want that
torso on torso action.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.481
[quietly] Oh!

16:23.149 --> 16:26.653
No, no, no, Sage is doing it all wrong.

16:26.736 --> 16:29.071
Do you see how he's ignoring the keys,

16:29.155 --> 16:31.115
which I just outlined?

16:34.661 --> 16:37.079
Well, I think you've got the basics down!

16:37.747 --> 16:39.039
Namaste.

16:39.123 --> 16:41.334
Now go! Practice what I taught you

16:41.417 --> 16:43.753
and that trophy will be yours!

16:43.837 --> 16:45.338
Boom shakalaka!

16:47.214 --> 16:49.175
-[bell rings]
-[Maurice groans]

16:49.717 --> 16:50.802
What?

16:58.058 --> 16:58.893
Yech!

17:02.772 --> 17:06.442
Is everything okay, Maurice?
Bells have been ringing all night!

17:06.526 --> 17:08.862
No time to stop. Cake o'clock. Again.

17:14.074 --> 17:15.159
Got it!

17:15.242 --> 17:16.410
Let's go.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.122
Any ideas?

17:20.206 --> 17:21.290
So many.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.918
They wash over me
like a never-ending wave--

17:24.043 --> 17:26.379
Shh. Don't speak. I'll handle this.

17:27.505 --> 17:28.715
[box creaking loudly]

17:30.008 --> 17:31.175
[snoring]

17:31.258 --> 17:32.385
Huh?

17:32.468 --> 17:33.427
Hmm?

17:35.304 --> 17:37.557
Hey, I can't see!

17:38.182 --> 17:40.100
Ow! Careful.

17:40.184 --> 17:42.478
I hope I don't fall! [shouts]

17:42.562 --> 17:44.022
[splashes]

17:45.023 --> 17:47.942
Wow! Look at all this booty!

17:49.694 --> 17:51.905
Ah! Oh.

17:52.030 --> 17:53.322
Okay. [chuckles]

17:53.447 --> 17:55.575
You caught us. [chuckles]

17:55.700 --> 17:59.954
Can't blame a lemur for trying, though,
am I right? Am I right? [sobs]

18:00.079 --> 18:01.455
[snoring]

18:03.833 --> 18:05.125
[giggles]

18:05.251 --> 18:07.837
He's asleep! [laughs]

18:07.962 --> 18:09.213
It's a little creepy.

18:09.881 --> 18:11.131
-[squeaking]
-Hmm?

18:11.215 --> 18:13.009
-[Mort humming]
-Mort, what're you doing?

18:13.092 --> 18:15.803
I'm finding my King Julien!

18:15.887 --> 18:17.263
No, no, no! You're, ugh...

18:17.346 --> 18:20.433
You're going the wrong way!
We're supposed to be going this way!

18:22.727 --> 18:25.438
No! King Julien is this way!

18:26.230 --> 18:28.232
[both grunting]

18:30.818 --> 18:32.111
Let go, Mort.

18:34.321 --> 18:36.824
Um, we have another one of those, right?

18:36.908 --> 18:39.452
No, Mort, we do not have another one--

18:43.790 --> 18:45.458
[both yelling]

18:50.212 --> 18:53.049
Huh? Mort, do something!

18:54.968 --> 18:57.011
Too many holes!

19:00.473 --> 19:01.766
[Clover] Oh, come on!

19:01.849 --> 19:04.268
Back-pat, torso action.

19:04.351 --> 19:06.479
Back-pat, torso action.

19:07.855 --> 19:08.689
Blimey.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.026
[Magee] Where's the Captain?

19:12.110 --> 19:14.821
Everybody! Where's the Captain!

19:15.738 --> 19:17.197
Ha! That's right!

19:17.281 --> 19:18.741
We've got the Captain

19:18.825 --> 19:20.409
and we're taking this ship!

19:20.493 --> 19:21.702
Argh!

19:22.829 --> 19:24.038
Sage!

19:24.122 --> 19:25.247
Do you mean him?

19:26.499 --> 19:28.292
Sage! What happened?

19:28.375 --> 19:32.005
How could that crocodile with
the tiny baby arms tie you up?

19:32.088 --> 19:33.923
Oi! I can hear you!

19:34.007 --> 19:36.717
He didn't. I tied myself up in protest.

19:36.801 --> 19:40.220
I hope my symbolic act will help
end violence everywhere.

19:40.304 --> 19:44.517
Oh, you have got to be--
You are like so unhelpful, man!

19:44.600 --> 19:45.601
[Captain grunting]

19:46.519 --> 19:50.439
Now then, if you want to take this ship,
you've got to become captain.

19:50.523 --> 19:53.067
And the only way to become captain...

19:54.234 --> 19:56.487
is to fight me!

19:56.570 --> 19:59.824
How about we make this a fair fight.
Give my challenger a weapon!

19:59.907 --> 20:02.785
Uh, are trophies still available?

20:02.869 --> 20:08.041
For the love of... Yes! Whoever gives
him a weapon will get a trophy.

20:08.124 --> 20:11.502
Unbelievable! I'm sorry
I ever started that whole trophy thing!

20:14.672 --> 20:16.423
A broom. Nice.

20:17.550 --> 20:18.676
[grunting]

20:18.801 --> 20:20.219
Hey!  En garde!

20:20.302 --> 20:22.138
[both grunting]

20:23.556 --> 20:24.724
[Julien groaning]

20:27.351 --> 20:28.811
[Julien laughing]

20:33.273 --> 20:34.608
Ha-ha!

20:37.904 --> 20:38.779
Ohh!

20:39.363 --> 20:40.656
[Captain chuckles]

20:43.701 --> 20:45.161
[mumbles incoherently]

20:48.039 --> 20:49.373
[Captain] Thank you so much!

20:51.792 --> 20:53.002
Oi, look over there!

20:55.755 --> 20:57.882
Oh! Ahoy there! [laughs]

20:58.007 --> 21:00.259
Hey, watch it! Careful with that thing.

21:00.342 --> 21:03.596
Well, looks like I've got you right
where I want you, doesn't it, hotshot?

21:07.934 --> 21:09.685
Time to walk the plank.

21:09.769 --> 21:11.353
[Julien shudders]

21:11.437 --> 21:12.438
[Mort crying]

21:12.521 --> 21:15.066
I can't believe it's going to end
this way.

21:15.149 --> 21:18.569
Just me and Mort in a toilet.

21:20.446 --> 21:24.784
I've never had to work this hard
for anything in my whole life!

21:24.867 --> 21:27.494
It's absolutely unfair.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.955
This was part of the deal.

21:29.080 --> 21:31.082
Do you want your mangoes or not?

21:31.165 --> 21:33.542
Hmm. Fine.

21:33.626 --> 21:35.753
All right, everybody, let's do this!

21:35.836 --> 21:38.464
Princess Julienne will now
pick the first--

21:38.547 --> 21:40.049
There! Are we done now?

21:40.133 --> 21:42.342
No, you have to take the first bite,

21:42.426 --> 21:46.222
bless the mangoes, and declare
that it will be a good harvest.

21:47.223 --> 21:50.559
Ugh! Oh, it's... [distorted] disgusting!

21:59.359 --> 22:01.361
[Julienne] You call that a mango?
It's not even ripe.

22:01.445 --> 22:04.073
I require a palate cleanser!

22:04.198 --> 22:05.532
The harvest is bad!

22:05.616 --> 22:07.493
[lemur] Bad harvest killed my cousin, man.

22:07.576 --> 22:09.536
We're all gonna die!

22:09.662 --> 22:12.123
-[all yelling]
-Oh, my gosh, I'm freaking out.

[Piney]
So, as you can see,

22:14.875 --> 22:17.253
everybody's in a whole heap of trouble.

22:17.336 --> 22:21.548
The kingdom's in a panic, Mort and Clover
are going down with the ship,

22:21.632 --> 22:24.885
and King Julien is walking the plank
to a watery grave.

22:24.969 --> 22:25.886
Lot of teeth.

22:25.970 --> 22:28.806
And Ted? Well, Ted found his sock.

22:28.889 --> 22:30.599
Well, hooray!

22:30.683 --> 22:33.351
Too bad about everybody else, though.

22:33.435 --> 22:35.271
A real shame.

22:35.353 --> 22:36.189
Poo!

22:36.605 --> 22:38.065
