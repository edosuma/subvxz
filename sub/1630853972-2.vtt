WEBVTT

00:20.454 --> 00:22.222
Plantain?

00:24.758 --> 00:26.527
I don't care what it takes,

00:26.560 --> 00:28.595
you are gonna get
this plane in the air!

00:28.629 --> 00:34.134
Eh, it's not getting it in
the air that I'm worried about.

00:34.168 --> 00:36.637
Listen to me,
you backwater B. A. Baracus.

00:36.670 --> 00:39.006
My tour group
is on a deadline.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.276
- And we're getting cranky!
-  And thirsty!

00:42.309 --> 00:43.744
And probably dengue fever.

00:43.777 --> 00:46.113
You want some help, boss?

00:46.146 --> 00:48.081
No, and not your boss,

00:48.115 --> 00:51.652
your guide on a scenic
aerial jungle tour.

00:51.685 --> 00:54.221
Yeah, we get lots of tours
that come through here

00:54.254 --> 00:56.089
with giant bags of guns.

00:56.123 --> 00:58.525
- You being smart with me?
- No, señor.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.627
I don't think
you'd understand me if I did.

01:00.661 --> 01:02.462
Now, you listen good.

01:02.496 --> 01:05.265
I don't know what tragic series
of screw-ups

01:05.299 --> 01:08.268
in the bird shit on a dog shit
you call a life

01:08.302 --> 01:11.004
led you to working
in this tropical hellhole,

01:11.038 --> 01:12.506
but trust me when I say

01:12.539 --> 01:14.408
that if you don't find me
a working plane,

01:14.441 --> 01:16.510
I'll shove a propeller
down your throat,

01:16.543 --> 01:18.111
an engine up your ass,

01:18.145 --> 01:20.180
and use you
to fly my tour group!

01:20.214 --> 01:22.216
Okay, you take off in five.

01:22.249 --> 01:23.483
And that is called leadership.

01:23.517 --> 01:24.651
Is it?

01:24.685 --> 01:26.220
Felt more like
a threat of sodomy.

01:26.253 --> 01:28.288
That's the title of my novel!

01:28.322 --> 01:31.158
Oh, relax. These old birds
maintain themselves.

01:31.191 --> 01:32.726
They're indestructible.

01:37.064 --> 01:39.533
I'm calling my travel
agent--this is a bad tour.

01:39.566 --> 01:41.034
Not actually a tour.

01:41.068 --> 01:44.204
Just a bad mission
organized by a bad leader.

01:44.238 --> 01:46.440
You guys, Fabian chose Ray
to lead us.

01:46.473 --> 01:48.709
I say we respect that, and--

01:48.742 --> 01:52.412
I couldn't finish,
even as a joke.

01:52.446 --> 01:54.114
You suck, dude.

01:54.147 --> 01:56.717
I'll--I'll admit that we're
off to a rough start,

01:56.750 --> 01:58.252
but if we stick together--

01:58.285 --> 01:59.453
We'll die together?

01:59.486 --> 02:00.687
Archer, help me out.

02:00.721 --> 02:03.423
You've been in worse spots
than this, right?

02:03.457 --> 02:06.059
Archer? Archer?

02:06.093 --> 02:07.427
Oh, sorry.

02:07.461 --> 02:09.062
I was deep in thought
about what would happen

02:09.096 --> 02:11.031
if I took one of the thousands
of piranhas

02:11.064 --> 02:12.466
from the waters
that now surround us

02:12.499 --> 02:14.434
and shoved it down
your esophagus.

02:14.468 --> 02:16.603
And what would happen if I did
the same thing 20 times

02:16.637 --> 02:18.672
and then set you on fire?

02:21.341 --> 02:24.545
I mean, he'd probably die.

03:06.753 --> 03:08.655
Cheese and rice!

03:08.689 --> 03:10.424
That was the cheese and rice.

03:10.457 --> 03:12.559
Salvage with your back.

03:12.593 --> 03:14.795
Ooh, if you see a very
unstable bomb, that's mine.

03:14.828 --> 03:16.797
And feel free
to help, Archer.

03:16.830 --> 03:18.632
I would, Ray,
but not helping pays the same

03:18.665 --> 03:19.800
and doesn't require trying.

03:19.833 --> 03:21.268
What is your problem lately?

03:21.301 --> 03:22.503
In Mother's absence,

03:22.536 --> 03:23.770
I realized I can do
what I want,

03:23.804 --> 03:25.138
e.g., nothing,

03:25.172 --> 03:27.074
when I want, e. g., now,

03:27.107 --> 03:29.076
because no one is the boss
of me anymore,

03:29.109 --> 03:30.310
e.g., I'm done talking.

03:30.344 --> 03:33.280
I am literally
the boss of you.

03:33.313 --> 03:36.016
Bomb! No, wait, rock.

03:36.049 --> 03:38.318
Well, we're definitely
on an island.

03:38.352 --> 03:40.020
And surrounded by piranhas.

03:40.053 --> 03:41.321
And possibly those hippos
that escaped

03:41.355 --> 03:42.756
from Pablo Escobar's zoo.

03:42.789 --> 03:44.224
Good crash, Ray.

03:44.258 --> 03:45.526
I didn't choose this.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.194
I was trying
to stay on schedule

03:47.227 --> 03:49.162
to impress Fabian
with my leadership.

03:49.196 --> 03:51.031
You don't know
the pressure I'm under

03:51.064 --> 03:52.299
to make mission quotas.

03:52.332 --> 03:53.767
I--God damn it, woman!

03:53.800 --> 03:56.036
Quit licking the toads!

03:56.069 --> 03:58.272
Ugh! Can we go
to a different island?

03:58.305 --> 04:00.007
The frogs here are non-druggie.

04:00.040 --> 04:02.276
No.
We dig in, wait for rescue.

04:02.309 --> 04:04.444
Yeah, we need to keep up
our strength for the mission.

04:04.478 --> 04:07.381
So, obviously,
piranha barbecue.

04:07.414 --> 04:09.683
No!
We need better frogs!

04:09.716 --> 04:12.219
No!
We need to get back up river!

04:12.252 --> 04:13.220
No.
No.

04:13.253 --> 04:14.388
Yep.
Yeah, sure.

04:14.421 --> 04:16.390
No.
- Everybody stop taking charge!

04:16.423 --> 04:18.592
I'm already in charge,
and I'm making a plan.

04:18.625 --> 04:21.361
For how to fill the power
vacuum left by you sucking?

04:21.395 --> 04:22.763
For the mission--

04:22.796 --> 04:25.299
liberating a stash
of stolen medical supplies

04:25.332 --> 04:28.001
from the warlord known
only as Serpiente.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.636
Ring a bell?
- Oh, yeah.

04:29.670 --> 04:31.405
We're still doing that?
- Yes!

04:31.438 --> 04:34.208
It's my only chance to maintain
my leadership position.

04:34.241 --> 04:37.110
- Slash parking space.
- Ooh, stakes.

04:37.144 --> 04:39.546
Look, we may have crashed
and lost all our supplies.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.014
And guns.

04:41.048 --> 04:43.350
And a bomb that had
sentimental value.

04:43.383 --> 04:46.486
This was her detonator.

04:46.520 --> 04:49.590
But we can get resupplied
once we contact Fabian.

04:49.623 --> 04:52.159
Cheryl, where are we
with the hand-crank sat phone.

04:52.192 --> 04:55.629
- Uh, on an island?
- I mean, did you crank it?

04:55.662 --> 04:57.798
A lady never tells.

04:57.831 --> 05:00.100
Why are you even here?

05:00.133 --> 05:02.436
It was the best
of my bad options.

05:02.469 --> 05:05.239
Lord of Cinders,

05:05.272 --> 05:08.242
command me!

05:08.275 --> 05:11.144
Forgot my keys
when I left two minutes ago.

05:11.178 --> 05:13.046
Oh, they're on the printer.

05:13.080 --> 05:17.451
FYI, the Lord of Cinders is
always looking for new candles.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.152
Uh, good to know.

05:19.186 --> 05:20.787
Margo?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.723
Explode if you're close!

05:22.756 --> 05:25.125
Krieger, stop trying
to detonate a missing bomb

05:25.158 --> 05:26.460
before you kill us.

05:26.493 --> 05:28.795
Uh-oh, someone's mad
they're not in charge.

05:28.829 --> 05:31.131
No.
I accept Fabian's decision.

05:31.164 --> 05:32.599
I'm choosing to be good
at my job

05:32.633 --> 05:34.201
and let positive things come.

05:34.234 --> 05:35.636
Like Ray getting more chances

05:35.669 --> 05:37.738
to kill us with his arrogance
and incompetence?

05:37.771 --> 05:39.206
"Incobegence"!

05:39.239 --> 05:40.440
Okay, it's charged.

05:40.474 --> 05:41.441
Everybody shut up.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.343
And this is your desk.

05:43.377 --> 05:46.079
If you need anything,
I'm right in there.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.582
Oh, and if a rival agency attacks,

05:48.615 --> 05:50.684
your chair is bulletproof.

05:50.717 --> 05:52.452
Agent Gillette, status report.

05:52.486 --> 05:54.488
Tiny hiccup.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.456
We, uh, need an extraction.

05:56.490 --> 05:58.292
Agent error, I presume.

05:58.325 --> 05:59.326
Hi, Fabian.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.761
Specifically lead agent error.

06:00.794 --> 06:02.296
Quit it!

06:02.329 --> 06:05.199
Look, Fabian, I-I-I know
it's a poor carpenter

06:05.232 --> 06:06.300
who blames his tools,

06:06.333 --> 06:07.568
but I have got a team

06:07.601 --> 06:10.003
of some real, real shit hammers
down here.

06:10.037 --> 06:12.206
And a helicopter extraction

06:12.239 --> 06:14.374
would alert Serpiente
to your presence,

06:14.408 --> 06:16.343
compromising
the entire mission.

06:16.376 --> 06:18.445
The best I can do
is a supply drop

06:18.478 --> 06:21.014
with local pilots
at your expense.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.050
You can pick it up
five miles downriver,

06:23.083 --> 06:24.551
and it's another five
to the compound.

06:24.585 --> 06:26.386
So tally-ho.

06:26.420 --> 06:28.288
Tally how?
We're stranded on an island

06:28.322 --> 06:30.057
in the middle of the Amazon,
you doof!

06:30.090 --> 06:32.693
Perhaps you've heard
of a new invention.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.761
It holds people
and floats on water.

06:34.795 --> 06:37.030
-  Ice!
- He means boats.

06:37.064 --> 06:38.765
Ice can be boats.
Ask Jeffrey Pike.

06:38.799 --> 06:40.634
Call again when you're
outside the compound

06:40.667 --> 06:42.002
for further instructions.

06:42.035 --> 06:43.337
Now, where were we?

06:43.370 --> 06:45.539
God, you're like if syphilis
was a person.

06:45.572 --> 06:47.307
Hello? Damn it!

06:47.341 --> 06:48.675
I don't think he heard that.
Ray, call him back.

06:48.709 --> 06:50.410
This mission doesn't make
any damn sense.

06:50.444 --> 06:51.645
How are we gonna extract

06:51.678 --> 06:54.248
these supposed
medical supplies anyway?

06:54.281 --> 06:56.083
Well, we can start
by building a raft

06:56.116 --> 06:57.518
Huck Finn style,

06:57.551 --> 06:59.186
but without all the, you know--

06:59.219 --> 07:01.788
Analysis of the hypocrisy
of civilized society?

07:01.822 --> 07:04.525
- Archer, what are you doing?
- My own thing, Lana.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.393
Call me
when we're leaving the island.

07:16.170 --> 07:17.738
You know, I'm unarmed

07:17.771 --> 07:21.208
and thus more likely
to instantly kill...

07:21.241 --> 07:24.178
anyone who tries to hurt
my new best friend!

07:24.211 --> 07:26.213
- I shall call you--

07:26.246 --> 07:28.448
- Finished!
- Are we?

07:28.482 --> 07:29.683
You made a death trap

07:29.716 --> 07:31.585
out of pieces
of a previous death trap?

07:31.618 --> 07:33.153
- Oh, sorry.

07:33.187 --> 07:35.189
Everyone, this is Ryan.

07:35.222 --> 07:37.057
- Charmed, I'm sure.

07:37.090 --> 07:39.459
You're really gonna go this
entire mission without helping?

07:39.493 --> 07:41.361
I'm just embracing
my new philosophy

07:41.395 --> 07:43.163
of doing what I want
when I want.

07:43.197 --> 07:45.432
Ugh, isn't that
what you always do?

07:45.465 --> 07:47.401
Yes, but now I'm, you know,
really leaning in.

07:48.635 --> 07:50.771
Sorry, we're really
leaning in.

07:50.804 --> 07:53.173
But not on that raft.
It's a death trap.

07:53.207 --> 07:56.343
Enough! It's a great raft!
And you want to know why?

07:56.376 --> 07:58.011
Because only half of it
is sinking?

07:58.045 --> 08:00.480
Because we made it as a team.

08:00.514 --> 08:02.516
Teamwork is getting us
off this island.

08:02.549 --> 08:04.184
There's a famous saying--

08:04.218 --> 08:06.186
"If you want to go fast,
go alone.

08:06.220 --> 08:08.388
But if you want to go far--"

08:08.422 --> 08:10.257
- Ryan! No!

08:14.394 --> 08:16.430
Good news--
I checked, and we have room

08:16.463 --> 08:19.099
in the budget for an extract
with the whisper copter.

08:19.132 --> 08:20.634
Susan, if we help them now,

08:20.667 --> 08:23.003
they'll never learn
to walk on their own.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.371
But I love your initiative.

08:24.404 --> 08:27.107
You're now
my executive assistant.

08:27.140 --> 08:29.409
The position comes
with a shotgun.

08:29.443 --> 08:31.078
What are you saying?

08:33.447 --> 08:37.751
Oh, he said, "Sacrifice
through flame brings purity."

08:37.784 --> 08:40.454
If you keep struggling,
I'm done sucking out the venom.

08:40.487 --> 08:43.123
Okeydoke,
we need a new mission leader.

08:43.156 --> 08:45.592
Pass.
I'm still thinking about Ryan.

08:45.626 --> 08:46.793
I meant me.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.362
Or I could take
a whack at it.

08:48.395 --> 08:50.130
And why would you lead?

08:50.163 --> 08:52.266
Why not? I'm the same rank
as you and Archer,

08:52.299 --> 08:54.735
and I'm literally saving
Ray's life as we speak.

08:54.768 --> 08:56.470
Aah!

08:56.503 --> 08:58.138
Oh, okay.

08:58.172 --> 08:59.706
Ray says, "Not fast enough,"

08:59.740 --> 09:01.608
and that as
Miss Archer's assistant,

09:01.642 --> 09:03.343
I'm already de facto leader,

09:03.377 --> 09:05.212
depending
on what "de facto" means.

09:07.281 --> 09:11.185
It shall be I who leads.

09:11.218 --> 09:12.686
Where did you get
a flare gun?

09:12.719 --> 09:14.121
I found it in the wreckage.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.422
And you wasted it

09:15.455 --> 09:17.224
on a gesture
highlighting your impotence.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.193
Highlighting my lack
of impotence!

09:19.226 --> 09:20.561
He quavered.

09:20.594 --> 09:23.463
- Also, flares attract hippos!
- No, they don't.

09:23.497 --> 09:25.566
Oh, then she's
just a coincidence.

09:25.599 --> 09:28.335
Oh! Jesus Christ!

09:28.368 --> 09:30.270
Goddamn!
Escobar breeds a good hippo.

09:30.304 --> 09:31.438
It's sinking the raft!

09:31.471 --> 09:33.740
What's that beeping?

09:33.774 --> 09:35.509
Margo, you came back to me!

09:35.542 --> 09:38.445
This reunion's going out
with a bang! Ugh!

09:38.478 --> 09:41.081
No! Margo!

09:43.383 --> 09:46.653
- Look!
- Yes! The supply drop!

09:46.687 --> 09:48.222
What? No.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.657
That cloud--it looks like
a centaur choking me.

09:56.563 --> 09:58.398
Solid leadership, Ray.

09:58.432 --> 10:00.167
Ray?

10:00.200 --> 10:01.668
Yeah. Ray's dead.

10:01.702 --> 10:03.537
What? No.

10:08.175 --> 10:09.743
Okay, people,
let's move out,

10:09.776 --> 10:11.578
starting with moving me.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.046
We've got to hurry.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.715
Someone else could have seen
the supply drop.

10:14.748 --> 10:16.750
- I could lead a team ahead.
- And straight into quicksand?

10:16.783 --> 10:18.719
At least I am trying to lead.

10:18.752 --> 10:21.121
Hey, I'm still leading
this mission!

10:21.154 --> 10:24.258
Now, make me a stretcher
and a fan out of palm fronds.

10:24.291 --> 10:25.592
My skin is on fire.

10:25.626 --> 10:28.028
We are not carrying you
like a king.

10:28.061 --> 10:29.730
Or burying you like one.

10:29.763 --> 10:32.099
If you die, let's be honest,
it's a shallow river grave.

10:32.132 --> 10:33.667
I'd love that for you.

10:33.700 --> 10:36.103
I'll be fine!
Right, Krieger?

10:36.136 --> 10:37.538
Eh...

10:37.571 --> 10:39.306
So I sucked poison
out of his face for nothing?

10:39.339 --> 10:40.507
It's still a fun story.

10:40.541 --> 10:42.075
But if Ray doesn't get
antivenom soon,

10:42.109 --> 10:43.610
there could be
permanent consequences.

10:43.644 --> 10:46.079
What, like,
my face will stay like this?

10:46.113 --> 10:48.515
Yes, because you'll be dead.
Ugh.

10:48.549 --> 10:50.284
Okay, I'm taking command.

10:50.317 --> 10:51.451
Cheryl.
- Present!

10:51.485 --> 10:53.020
You stay
with Ray and Krieger.

10:53.053 --> 10:54.521
The rest of us will head
for the drop,

10:54.555 --> 10:56.190
then push on
to find the medical supplies

10:56.223 --> 10:57.157
and ideally antivenom.

10:57.191 --> 10:58.625
Here, crank this

10:58.659 --> 11:00.527
to take your mind off
how you screwed the mission.

11:00.561 --> 11:03.197
I got bit tripping
over your stupid tapir!

11:03.230 --> 11:05.365
A tapir, not my tapir!

11:05.399 --> 11:08.268
You can't own something
that majestic!

11:12.539 --> 11:15.075
Ah! Ow.

11:15.108 --> 11:17.211
FYI, Cyril,
this jungle has trees.

11:17.244 --> 11:19.079
You released the branch
in my face.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.781
As a teaching moment.
You're welcome.

11:20.814 --> 11:23.150
Jungle physics 101!

11:23.183 --> 11:26.353
Can we not shout so much
on this covert jungle mission?

11:26.386 --> 11:28.622
Guys, guys, guys!
I found a footpath!

11:28.655 --> 11:31.158
No, I don't like it.
It's too exposed.

11:31.191 --> 11:32.759
Counterpoint--it's easier.

11:32.793 --> 11:36.163
So you literally want to take
the path of least resistance?

11:36.196 --> 11:37.464
It's famous for a reason.

11:37.497 --> 11:39.066
Oh, we should put it
to a vote,

11:39.099 --> 11:41.401
since, you know,
we are all equals here.

11:41.435 --> 11:43.303
Counterpoint.

11:43.337 --> 11:45.205
And the nays have it.

11:45.239 --> 11:47.207
Damn.

11:47.241 --> 11:49.109
Why is the person in charge,

11:49.142 --> 11:51.578
who also happens
to be snake-bit,

11:51.612 --> 11:53.180
turning the damn crank?

11:53.213 --> 11:55.148
Come on!
It'll get your blood flowing.

11:55.182 --> 11:56.617
Ooh, actually,
that's really bad.

11:56.650 --> 11:58.652
Good news--
- The others are back?

11:58.685 --> 12:01.088
No, I'm done
with your shallow grave.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.523
I made it extra shallow.

12:02.556 --> 12:05.192
You know, I didn't ask
to lead this agency.

12:05.225 --> 12:08.161
I just worked hard,
stabbed a couple backs,

12:08.195 --> 12:10.364
and when the position
was offered to me, I said,

12:10.397 --> 12:13.100
"Ray, take a risk.
Try something new."

12:13.133 --> 12:15.335
I say that in my lab
all the time.

12:15.369 --> 12:17.337
I have a jungle question.

12:17.371 --> 12:19.573
What do you do
if rocks are getting closer?

12:19.606 --> 12:21.074
Uh, wait for them to leave.

12:21.108 --> 12:23.277
That's your plan?
Ray is dying!

12:23.310 --> 12:25.312
Well, they have guns,
and we have Cyril,

12:25.345 --> 12:27.247
who is, like,
the opposite of a gun.

12:27.281 --> 12:28.482
If we'd stuck to the jungle,

12:28.515 --> 12:30.284
we would have missed them completely.

12:30.317 --> 12:31.752
Don't blame the path
of least resistance for this.

12:31.785 --> 12:33.420
I'm blaming you!

12:33.453 --> 12:35.455
- Ooh, I've got an idea.
- Guys, look.

12:35.489 --> 12:37.124
Guys with guns are leaving?

12:37.157 --> 12:39.259
Thank you,
path of least resistance.

12:39.293 --> 12:41.595
They're going
for our supply drop, dummy,

12:41.628 --> 12:43.330
which means
they'll have more guns!

12:43.363 --> 12:45.566
Hello?
Lady with an idea here.

12:45.599 --> 12:48.135
Well, yeah, there'll be
some resistance later.

12:48.168 --> 12:50.470
- Okay, I'm just doing it.
- Ah.

12:50.504 --> 12:51.772
If I could just get
to that jeep...

12:51.805 --> 12:53.740
Then you can get shot
hot-wiring it?

12:59.346 --> 13:02.082
Oh, man, you didn't say
that was part of it.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.789
Damn, you think
you know a guy.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.757
And then all of your
suspicions are confirmed.

13:10.791 --> 13:12.359
Now's our chance.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.295
Gracias...

13:15.329 --> 13:19.299
You're not the man we hired
to catch the goat kisser.

13:19.333 --> 13:22.169
There really is a goat kisser?

13:27.341 --> 13:29.443
Punch it!
What are you waiting for?

13:29.476 --> 13:30.744
A gun!

13:33.647 --> 13:36.550
Oh, my God, a baby Browning?

13:36.583 --> 13:39.152
Um, this will be great
if we need to bruise a sparrow.

13:39.186 --> 13:40.687
Ray! You guys still there?

13:40.721 --> 13:43.423
Help me! Help me!
Get him off!

13:43.457 --> 13:45.592
My douchey combat boots!

13:45.626 --> 13:47.427
And also my leg!

13:47.461 --> 13:50.564
Oh, my God, this hippo game
is so much more fun in person!

13:50.597 --> 13:53.667
Ah, we'll call you back!

13:53.700 --> 13:55.669
Not that I care,
but do you have a plan?

13:55.702 --> 13:57.271
Why are you asking her?

13:57.304 --> 14:00.340
I created the diversion
that saved our asses!

14:00.374 --> 14:02.376
Ugh!
And double-knotted this rope!

14:02.409 --> 14:04.178
Fine!
What's your great plan?

14:04.211 --> 14:06.747
Turn!

14:09.550 --> 14:11.351
Now's our chance,
while they're blind.

14:13.253 --> 14:15.522
Oh, are those bananas?

14:15.556 --> 14:18.091
No, plantains again.
Ugh!

14:18.125 --> 14:19.393
Hey, you think
you could maybe use

14:19.426 --> 14:21.028
our only gun on a bad guy?

14:21.061 --> 14:23.363
I could try, but I'm not sure
it would break the skin.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.601
Close range doesn't count.

14:34.441 --> 14:36.777
Ray, crate secure.
We're en route to the compound.

14:36.810 --> 14:41.248
Okay. Obviously, far be it
for me to tell you

14:41.281 --> 14:44.585
what your lived experience is
as a spider.

14:44.618 --> 14:47.120
But what I would ask is--

14:47.154 --> 14:48.488
Aah!

14:48.522 --> 14:50.457
Oh, my, I heard Ray scream.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.426
Is the jungle
still turning on him?

14:52.459 --> 14:54.695
Wait. You're alone up there?
Where's Pam?

14:56.663 --> 14:58.365
¿Qué pasa, homeys?

15:04.204 --> 15:06.673
Great. These

15:06.707 --> 15:08.308
Thank you, Percy Fawcett.

15:08.342 --> 15:11.545
And thank you for ruining
this entire mission.

15:11.578 --> 15:13.013
How did I ruin the mission?

15:13.046 --> 15:15.015
Ray's the leader,
and Cyril almost got us eaten.

15:15.048 --> 15:18.185
Killed, not eaten.
Hippos are herbivores.

15:18.218 --> 15:21.054
Ray may be in charge,
but you drove off without Pam

15:21.088 --> 15:23.223
and led us to a guerrilla camp
and got Ray bitten.

15:23.257 --> 15:24.591
And I wouldn't be shocked

15:24.625 --> 15:26.326
if you're the reason
our plane crashed.

15:26.360 --> 15:28.228
Why? Because I saw a piece
of the engine fall off

15:28.262 --> 15:29.596
and didn't say anything?

15:29.630 --> 15:32.432
- Oh, my God!
- That is next-level lazy.

15:32.466 --> 15:34.268
AKA,
path of least resistance.

15:34.301 --> 15:37.538
AKA, careless because you
don't care about us, Archer.

15:37.571 --> 15:39.706
And maybe you never did.
I don't know.

15:39.740 --> 15:43.210
I think you just became a spy
to please your mother!

15:43.243 --> 15:45.712
Too far?

15:47.381 --> 15:49.016
What are you doing now?

15:49.049 --> 15:50.584
Proving a point
by getting in this truck

15:50.617 --> 15:52.186
the hardest way possible, Lana,

15:52.219 --> 15:56.089
then taking charge and getting
Pam back because I care!

15:56.123 --> 15:57.558
Are we happy about this?

15:57.591 --> 15:59.459
I honestly do not know anymore.

15:59.493 --> 16:02.596
And by the way,
nothing pleased my mother!

16:02.629 --> 16:04.565
Ray, any soldiers at the camp?

16:04.598 --> 16:06.233
No, they're gone.

16:06.266 --> 16:08.268
But this place is magical.

16:08.302 --> 16:11.071
They have plants, waterfalls,

16:11.104 --> 16:14.007
a strangely powerful
sense of euphoria.

16:14.041 --> 16:15.309
He sounds better.

16:15.342 --> 16:17.211
Uh, that's just
the endorphins triggered

16:17.244 --> 16:20.180
by the snake and spider venom
competing to ravage his system.

16:20.214 --> 16:23.050
If his kidneys had mouths,
they'd be screaming.

16:23.083 --> 16:25.319
I thought maybe the venoms
would cancel each other out,

16:25.352 --> 16:27.020
like how two negatives
make a positive.

16:27.054 --> 16:28.455
Shut up and listen!

16:28.488 --> 16:30.357
Lana blocked the road
with thoughtless carnage.

16:30.390 --> 16:31.625
Hello?
I was saving us!

16:31.658 --> 16:33.193
So find another way

16:33.227 --> 16:35.062
to meet us
at the compound to rescue Pam.

16:35.095 --> 16:37.297
Roger.
We'll take that helicopter.

16:37.331 --> 16:39.333
Uh, that's just rubble.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.168
Wait, why are we
rescuing Pam?

16:42.736 --> 16:44.705
Sorry I punched you
in the balls.

16:44.738 --> 16:47.441
In my defense, one of you
kicked me in the cooter.

16:47.474 --> 16:50.010
So, you know,
a nut tap for a nut tap.

16:51.445 --> 16:54.414
So how long
till we get to the, uh--

16:54.448 --> 16:57.284
Perfect 2/3 replica
of the Taj Mahal?

16:57.317 --> 17:00.053
I'd say "why," but the answer
is clearly "because."

17:00.087 --> 17:02.556
Stop admiring the warlord!

17:02.589 --> 17:04.057
I bet the supplies
are in there.

17:04.091 --> 17:06.760
And there's Pam!

17:06.793 --> 17:09.162
Now, this next part
is a little tricky.

17:09.196 --> 17:12.466
We hit "select"
so that it prints collated.

17:12.499 --> 17:14.568
Agent Gillette?

17:14.601 --> 17:16.136
Uh, not speaking.

17:16.170 --> 17:18.305
Archer, where is
Agent Gillette?

17:18.338 --> 17:21.575
- Well, he's either dead or--
- Nailing it!

17:21.608 --> 17:23.310
God, I wish I could see this.

17:23.343 --> 17:25.345
- You sure you're good to fly?
- Hell, yes.

17:25.379 --> 17:26.713
I've got a hard-on

17:26.747 --> 17:29.283
like the thing
you fly the helicopter with.

17:29.316 --> 17:31.218
Oh, yeah, that's actually
venom-induced priapism.

17:31.251 --> 17:32.586
It's a sign of--
- Fun!

17:32.619 --> 17:33.754
Is that dynamite?

17:33.787 --> 17:35.455
I saw it first.

17:35.489 --> 17:37.057
Also, we lost Pam.

17:37.090 --> 17:39.359
Pam?
Oh, yes, Pam.

17:39.393 --> 17:42.229
Oh, I'll miss her Pamness.

17:42.262 --> 17:45.465
But if you're at the compound,
we can begin phase two.

17:45.499 --> 17:47.034
Of how many phases?

17:47.067 --> 17:49.269
Because at this rate,
phase three will just be me

17:49.303 --> 17:51.171
and the panther
that eats Cyril.

17:51.205 --> 17:53.540
Final phase--
retrieve the red suitcase

17:53.574 --> 17:57.177
on medical pilot YKLJ-56.

17:57.211 --> 17:59.446
Wait, one suitcase?

17:59.479 --> 18:01.715
I thought we were recovering
medical supplies.

18:01.748 --> 18:04.351
And I thought the mission
would be over hours ago.

18:04.384 --> 18:06.320
Find the suitcase,
and you will be extracted.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.588
Ta-ta.

18:07.621 --> 18:09.556
- Well, that was--
- Suspicious as hell?

18:09.590 --> 18:11.058
Yeah! Are we really gonna--

18:11.091 --> 18:13.060
Do the thing
that gets us extracted?

18:13.093 --> 18:14.461
Yes, here's the plan.

18:14.494 --> 18:16.330
You two head
for the warehouse.

18:16.363 --> 18:19.099
Lana will retrieve
the suitcase.

18:19.132 --> 18:22.569
Cyril will find the antivenom,
and then Lana will save Cyril.

18:22.603 --> 18:24.338
Dang it.

18:24.371 --> 18:27.174
Meanwhile, I'll murder
Serpiente and save Pam.

18:27.207 --> 18:29.042
I've always wanted to storm
the Taj Mahal,

18:29.076 --> 18:32.045
and this is
at least 2/3 as good.

18:32.079 --> 18:33.180
Serpiente!

18:33.213 --> 18:34.748
And sorry.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.584
That seems like a pre-existing
craftsmanship issue.

18:37.618 --> 18:39.186
You're late.

18:39.219 --> 18:41.188
I'm rescuing you to prove
that I care about you

18:41.221 --> 18:43.023
and didn't just become a spy
to impress my mother.

18:43.056 --> 18:45.025
I mean you're late
to kill Serpiente.

18:45.058 --> 18:47.694
His soldiers killed him months
ago for being a general dick.

18:47.728 --> 18:49.029
That was our nickname
for him!

18:49.062 --> 18:50.364
And now they use his base

18:50.397 --> 18:52.366
to distribute medicine
to the local population.

18:52.399 --> 18:54.134
Also, they grow coffee!

18:54.168 --> 18:57.037
Coffee?
So no warlord or drugs?

18:57.070 --> 18:58.272
Wait, why'd they kidnap you?

18:58.305 --> 19:00.707
I was too busy
punching peens to listen.

19:00.741 --> 19:02.676
But apparently they were--
What was it?

19:02.709 --> 19:05.045
Defending ourselves.
Ay, caray.

19:05.078 --> 19:06.580
Yeah, amigos,

19:06.613 --> 19:09.149
yeah, that should
make things easier, right?

19:10.751 --> 19:12.219
Dinamita!

19:12.252 --> 19:14.755
So I can't feel my body!

19:14.788 --> 19:17.724
Oh, that's a good sign
for the venom.

19:17.758 --> 19:20.994
The Lord of Cinder
demands sacrifice!

19:22.362 --> 19:25.566
- Ahh!
- I can hold it! I can hold it!

19:25.599 --> 19:27.334
Oh, no, that's my penis.

19:31.205 --> 19:33.173
Nice landing, boss.

19:33.207 --> 19:37.211
Then demote me!
Just give me antivenom!

19:37.244 --> 19:38.345
I'm looking!
I'm looking!

19:38.378 --> 19:40.214
Oh, there are just
so many labels!

19:40.247 --> 19:41.748
Stab me with everything!

19:41.782 --> 19:44.585
- Oh, shit, we need a new plan.
- We have one.

19:49.356 --> 19:51.058
Friendly fire, amigos.

19:51.091 --> 19:52.292
Hello?

19:52.326 --> 19:53.760
Tell your soldiers
to cease fire.

19:53.794 --> 19:56.730
Oh, I would, but someone
blew up our radio tower.

19:56.763 --> 20:00.067
Oh, sarcasm--
that's very helpful right now.

20:00.100 --> 20:02.202
Shit, I just did it, too.
Point taken.

20:02.236 --> 20:04.571
Uh, Archer, what about that?

20:04.605 --> 20:07.174
God, could the resistance
on this path get any worse?

20:07.207 --> 20:08.675
Good news--
my erection is back.

20:08.709 --> 20:11.445
- You had an erection?
- Oh, several.

20:11.478 --> 20:13.447
Bad news--
we're out of dynamite.

20:18.785 --> 20:22.055
Ha ha!
Taj my balls, bitches!

20:22.089 --> 20:24.057
Lana, look,
a fully alive Pam,

20:24.091 --> 20:28.095
and I saved you and befriended
a tapir all in one mission,

20:28.128 --> 20:30.330
because, Lana, I care.

20:30.364 --> 20:33.333
Great. You're just in time
to get shot by the bad guys.

20:33.367 --> 20:34.701
Well, technically,
they're the good guys

20:34.735 --> 20:36.470
and this was
a huge miscommunication.

20:36.503 --> 20:39.039
Look, it's the extract!

20:42.376 --> 20:43.710
I'll lead the way.

20:47.347 --> 20:48.482
Thanks.

20:48.515 --> 20:51.051
Got it.
I'll take it from here.

20:51.084 --> 20:53.120
- Aah!

20:56.490 --> 20:59.326
Stating the obvious, but, ow!
- What the shit?

20:59.359 --> 21:02.629
Uh, maybe that wasn't
our IIA helicopter.

21:02.663 --> 21:04.464
- Fabian?

21:04.498 --> 21:07.334
The helicopter
took the briefcase and not us.

21:07.367 --> 21:09.269
If it's a weight issue,
we can leave Cyril.

21:09.303 --> 21:11.171
Thank you
for the briefcase, Archer.

21:11.205 --> 21:14.441
I have continuing business
with Serpiente's successor.

21:14.474 --> 21:16.176
Apologies for leaving
you there.

21:16.210 --> 21:18.078
But you can't know
where it's going.

21:18.111 --> 21:20.013
Damn it, Fabian!

21:20.047 --> 21:22.316
When I see you, I'm gonna shove
your ass so far up your ass,

21:22.349 --> 21:24.184
you'll be upside down
and inside out!

21:24.218 --> 21:25.319
Enjoy the jungle.

21:25.352 --> 21:28.055
<i>I hear it's extra poisonous
in the fall.</i>

21:28.088 --> 21:29.456
Where were we?

21:29.489 --> 21:31.091
Oh, yes.

21:38.098 --> 21:40.434
man: Which one of you
is the leader?

21:40.467 --> 21:42.336
Oh, buddy, don't open
that can of worms.

21:48.475 --> 21:51.411
- So can we get a ride?

21:51.445 --> 21:54.147
Ryan!
You came to find me!

21:54.181 --> 21:56.483
Love truly is
the strongest compass.

21:57.784 --> 22:00.320
We know that tapir.

22:20.574 --> 22:23.443
Made in Georgia.
