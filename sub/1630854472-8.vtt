WE SAW EACH OTHER BRIEFLY
AT PATIENCE'S SHOW

06:13.460 --> 06:14.962
AND THEN COUPLE TIMES
AT BRINGSTON.

06:15.063 --> 06:16.243
- OH.
- MM-HMM.

06:24.589 --> 06:26.010
I MEAN, SOMEONE SHOULD
USE IT BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW

06:26.109 --> 06:27.171

IN THE WILD.

06:27.270 --> 06:29.292
- HA HA! WE--

THE HEAVY BOXES FOR ME.

06:37.638 --> 06:39.378

KEEPING IN TOUCH WITH HIM.

07:41.799 --> 07:43.782
KENNY SHOULD BE GETTING
THE HEAD COACH OFFER

07:43.881 --> 07:45.022
ANY DAY NOW.

07:45.121 --> 07:46.784
YOU SOUND CONFIDENT.

07:46.883 --> 07:49.065
IT'S EASY TO BE CONFIDENT
WHEN NOBODY ELSE WANTS THE JOB.

07:49.164 --> 07:50.705
HA HA!

07:50.806 --> 07:52.347
LOOK AT YOU--

07:52.447 --> 07:54.149
ALL OF THAT
AND A DATE TONIGHT.

07:54.248 --> 07:55.188
NOW YOU'RE JUST
BEING MEAN.

07:55.289 --> 07:56.789
HA HA HA!

07:56.890 --> 07:59.272
WHERE YOUR HUSBAND AT?

07:59.371 --> 08:03.835
ASHER: AND THAT IS WHAT I CALL
THE BAKER'S DOZEN.

08:03.935 --> 08:05.796
- NOTHING?
- UH-UH.

08:05.895 --> 08:07.717
MAYBE MY TIMING WAS OFF.
SHOULD A START OVER?

08:07.818 --> 08:09.037
PLEASE NO.

08:09.138 --> 08:10.438
I COULD LEAD
WITH A JOKE.

08:10.539 --> 08:11.560
YEAH.

08:11.659 --> 08:13.320
WHY DID COACH BAKER
STAND IN THE CORNER?

08:13.421 --> 08:14.361
WHY?

08:14.462 --> 08:15.962
BECAUSE HE NEEDED
A TIMEOUT.

08:16.063 --> 08:17.563
- MM-HMM.
- OHH...

08:17.664 --> 08:20.525
NOBODY SHOULD GIVE ME
THE MIC TONIGHT.

08:20.626 --> 08:23.048
I THINK IF YOU LEAN
LESS INTO THE DAD JOKES

08:23.147 --> 08:25.368
AND MORE INTO
WHO COACH BAKER IS,

08:25.469 --> 08:27.130
YOU'LL FIND
YOUR FUNNY.

08:27.229 --> 08:28.972
BEING FUNNY
ISN'T MY THING.

08:29.072 --> 08:32.213
IT'S J.J.'s.

08:32.314 --> 08:34.334
YOU STILL HAVEN'T
HEARD FROM HIM?

08:34.435 --> 08:35.696
NO.

08:35.795 --> 08:37.898
APPARENTLY, JORDAN
AND SPENCER HAVE,

08:37.997 --> 08:39.259
WHICH MEANS HE DIDN'T
MOVE OUT OF THIS HOUSE

08:39.359 --> 08:41.420
TO GET AWAY FROM US.

08:41.520 --> 08:44.062
HE MOVED OUT TO GET
AWAY FROM ME.

08:44.161 --> 08:46.183
MAYBE HE JUST NEEDS
A LITTLE SPACE.

08:46.283 --> 08:47.784
FROM JUST ME?

08:47.884 --> 08:49.345
WELL, SOMETIMES THE PEOPLE
WE TAKE OUR CRAP OUT ON

08:49.444 --> 08:51.667
ARE THE ONES
WE FEEL SAFEST WITH.

08:51.766 --> 08:54.709
DON'T MISTAKE J.J.
GHOSTING YOU FOR ANGER.

08:54.809 --> 08:58.591
JUST KEEP LETTING HIM
KNOW YOU'RE THERE.

08:58.690 --> 09:00.513
- OOH.
- HEY, YOU OK?

09:00.612 --> 09:02.713
YEAH. I THINK I JUST
PULLED A MUSCLE

09:02.814 --> 09:07.156
IN YOGA THE OTHER DAY,
BUT I'M FINE.

09:07.257 --> 09:09.117
NOW HIT ME WITH
ANOTHER DAD JOKE.

09:09.218 --> 09:10.559
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
- LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

09:10.659 --> 09:12.721
ALL RIGHT.
COMING UP. COMING UP.

09:12.821 --> 09:14.442
UH...OOH.

09:14.542 --> 09:17.363
WHY DID COACH BAKER
ASK FOR HIS CHANGE?

09:17.463 --> 09:19.966
- WHY?
- TO GET HIS QUARTERBACK.

09:20.066 --> 09:22.286
- HA HA HA!
- EH.

09:22.387 --> 09:24.168
HEY, DAD,
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

09:24.268 --> 09:25.728
HEY, YOU
MADE IT BACK.

09:25.829 --> 09:27.250
- BIRTHDAY BOY.
- ALL RIGHT.

09:27.350 --> 09:29.692
- WHAT'S HAPPENING, CAPTAIN?
- YOU KNOW.

09:29.792 --> 09:32.014
SO...HOW WAS IT?

09:32.113 --> 09:34.175
WILLMONT
WAS AMAZING, OK?

09:34.275 --> 09:36.055
I MEAN, THEIR
ATHLETIC FACILITY,

09:36.156 --> 09:37.177
IT RIVALS GAU's.

09:37.276 --> 09:38.978
PLUS, I GOT
TO SPEND TIME

09:39.078 --> 09:40.939
WITH THE OFFENSIVE
COORDINATOR AND HIS FAMILY.

09:41.040 --> 09:43.420
YEAH. HE REMINDS ME
A LOT OF YOU, YOU KNOW,

09:43.521 --> 09:45.343
AND HE HAD A TON
OF THINGS TO SAY

09:45.443 --> 09:47.223
ABOUT MY FUTURE
AS A QB.

09:47.324 --> 09:50.425
ALL RIGHT. WELL,
I DON'T DOUBT THAT.

09:50.526 --> 09:52.187
YOU KNOW, IT'S GONNA
BE PRETTY TOUGH

09:52.286 --> 09:54.669
TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
WILLMONT AND COASTAL.

09:54.769 --> 09:56.110
I MEAN, THERE'S
A TON OF REASONS

09:56.209 --> 09:57.310
FOR ME
TO STAY HERE.

09:57.410 --> 09:59.151
OH, SO YOU'RE SERIOUS
ABOUT TRANSFERRING.

09:59.252 --> 10:00.393
I THOUGHT THIS
WAS JUST, LIKE,

10:00.492 --> 10:02.154
A TESTING-OUT-THE-WATERS
TYPE OF A THING.

10:02.254 --> 10:05.156
NO. I WANT TO PLAY FOOTBALL
NEXT SEASON, YOU KNOW?

10:05.256 --> 10:06.837
GAU's PROGRAM
IS A MESS RIGHT NOW.

10:06.937 --> 10:08.038
WELL, MAYBE YOU
SHOULD GIVE THEM TIME

10:08.138 --> 10:09.559
TO TRY
TO FIGURE THINGS OUT.

10:09.659 --> 10:11.120
DAD, I'M OUT
OF TIME, OK?

10:11.220 --> 10:12.881
I HAVE TO THINK
ABOUT MY FUTURE,

10:12.981 --> 10:14.922
AND THAT MEANS FINDING A
COACH WHO BELIEVES IN ME.

10:15.021 --> 10:16.403
I BELIEVE IN YOU.

10:16.502 --> 10:18.244
I KNOW YOU DO, BUT YOU'RE
NOT MY COACH ANYMORE.

10:18.343 --> 10:19.805
YOU'RE MY DAD.

10:19.905 --> 10:22.207
I JUST HAVE TO FIND
MY VERSION OF YOU

10:22.307 --> 10:25.108
ON THE FOOTBALL
FIELD.

10:31.872 --> 10:33.935
YOU DO KNOW THERE'S PEOPLE
THAT DO THAT, RIGHT?

10:34.035 --> 10:35.096
BUT THAT
COSTS MONEY, OK?

10:35.196 --> 10:38.058
BESIDES, IT'S WHAT'S
INSIDE THAT COUNTS.

10:38.158 --> 10:39.859
OK, SO WHAT'S INSIDE?

10:39.959 --> 10:42.260
I FRAMED MY SPEECH
FOR BILLY TONIGHT.

10:42.360 --> 10:44.462
YOU DON'T WANT TO SPEND
A CENT, DO YOU?

10:44.562 --> 10:45.823
ARE YOU HERE
TO HELP ME

10:45.923 --> 10:47.144
OR JUST BE A PAIN
IN MY ASS?

10:47.244 --> 10:48.584
I JUST CAME TO GIVE YOU
THE HEADS-UP

10:48.685 --> 10:50.466
THAT LIV OVERHEARD
ME TELLING SKYE

10:50.565 --> 10:52.187
THAT YOU WERE BRINGING
ALICIA TONIGHT.

10:52.286 --> 10:53.507
WHAT IS WITH YOU
AND THAT DAMN MOUTH?

10:53.608 --> 10:55.228
I WAS HAVING
A PRIVATE CONVERSATION

10:55.329 --> 10:56.350
WITH MY GIRLFRIEND.

10:56.449 --> 10:58.151
BESIDES, SHE WAS
GONNA FIND OUT ANYWAY

10:58.251 --> 10:59.312
WHEN Y'ALL TWO
WALKED IN TOGETHER.

10:59.411 --> 11:00.752
HOW'D SHE TAKE IT?

11:00.853 --> 11:02.194
MORE PISSED AT ME
THAN CONCERNED ABOUT YOU

11:02.294 --> 11:03.154
IF THAT HELPS.

11:03.254 --> 11:04.475
YOU THINK
IT'S A BAD IDEA,

11:04.574 --> 11:06.036
ME BRINGING
ALICIA TONIGHT?

11:06.136 --> 11:08.278
I THINK IT'S A WORSE IDEA
TO UNINVITE HER NOW.

11:08.377 --> 11:10.119
BESIDES, YOU AND LIV
GONNA HAVE TO RIP OFF

11:10.218 --> 11:13.081
THAT BREAKUP BAND-AID
EVENTUALLY.

11:13.180 --> 11:14.682
[EXHALES]

11:14.781 --> 11:16.163
[INHALES]

11:16.263 --> 11:17.164
[PLAYS DRUMROLL]

11:17.264 --> 11:18.845
MM...

11:18.944 --> 11:21.206
OK. EITHER YOU'VE HAD
WAY TOO MUCH CAFFEINE

11:21.305 --> 11:22.967
OR SOMETHING'S
BUGGING.

11:23.067 --> 11:24.247
OR SOMETHING.

11:24.348 --> 11:26.370
ALL RIGHT.
HIT ME WITH IT.

11:26.470 --> 11:27.811
WHAT'S GOT YOU
SO RILED UP?

11:27.911 --> 11:29.252
I'M SUPPOSED TO BE
FINISHING UP

11:29.352 --> 11:30.531
MY SPEECH FOR
MY DAD'S BIRTHDAY,

11:30.632 --> 11:32.574
BUT ALL I CAN
THINK ABOUT

11:32.674 --> 11:34.255
IS THAT SPENCER'S
BRINGING A DATE.

11:34.355 --> 11:35.616
TO YOUR DAD'S
BIRTHDAY?

11:35.716 --> 11:36.977
I KNOW.

11:37.077 --> 11:39.497
I MEAN, HE CAN DO WHAT
HE WANTS TO DO, RIGHT?

11:39.598 --> 11:41.100
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

11:41.199 --> 11:42.661
IT'S JUST--
I DON'T KNOW.

11:42.761 --> 11:44.542
IT'S WEIRD SEEING HIM
MOVE ON BEFORE ME.

11:44.641 --> 11:46.703
AND WHO SAYS HE'S
MOVED ON BEFORE YOU?

11:46.803 --> 11:49.185
I THINK ME SHOWING UP
DATELESS SAYS IT ALL.

11:49.285 --> 11:51.226
THEN DON'T SHOW UP
DATELESS.

11:51.326 --> 11:53.588
WHAT IF I WENT
WITH YOU...

11:53.688 --> 11:57.310
AS YOUR FAUX DATE,
OF COURSE?

11:57.410 --> 12:00.232
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO DO THAT,

12:00.332 --> 12:02.033
AND DON'T SAY
"FAUX."

12:02.132 --> 12:04.115
IT'S WEIRD.

12:04.215 --> 12:05.636
I WANT TO GO.

12:05.736 --> 12:07.557
BESIDES, YOU NEED
SOMEONE BY YOUR SIDE

12:07.656 --> 12:10.199
WHO CAN MAKE YOU LAUGH
WHEN HE'S LOOKING

12:10.299 --> 12:13.241
AND MAYBE
EVEN WHEN HE'S NOT.

12:13.341 --> 12:15.943
JUST THINK
ABOUT IT.

12:17.504 --> 12:21.807
LAYLA: SO YOU BACK
FOR MORE RISK?

12:21.906 --> 12:23.208
UH...

12:23.308 --> 12:24.247
HEE HEE!

12:24.348 --> 12:26.949
ACTUALLY, UM...

12:28.391 --> 12:29.732
I'M BACK TO HEAR

12:29.832 --> 12:31.612
WHAT REALLY
WENT DOWN IN ATLANTA.

12:31.713 --> 12:34.334
UH, I MEAN, IT'S
LIKE I TOLD LIV--

12:34.435 --> 12:35.415
IT WAS FINE.

12:35.516 --> 12:36.656
WELL, YOU SEE,
I KNOW

12:36.756 --> 12:38.298
ALL OF YOUR
FACIAL EXPRESSIONS,

12:38.398 --> 12:39.538
AND THE ONE THAT
YOU HAD WHEN LIV ASKED

12:39.638 --> 12:41.699
HOW ATLANTA WAS WAS
YOUR "SO NOT FINE" LOOK.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.461
I DON'T HAVE
A "SO NOT FINE" LOOK.

12:43.561 --> 12:46.143
WAIT. HOW MANY FACIAL
EXPRESSIONS DO I HAVE?

12:46.242 --> 12:47.984
8. DON'T DODGE
THE QUESTION.

12:48.084 --> 12:50.386
OK. FINE. YEAH.

12:50.486 --> 12:52.747
SIMONE AND I HAD
A CONVERSATION

12:52.847 --> 12:54.068
OR TWO OR 3.

12:54.168 --> 12:55.309
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

12:55.409 --> 12:56.709
BECAUSE IT HAD NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOU

12:56.810 --> 12:58.790
AND EVERYTHING TO DO
WITH ME AND SIMONE.

12:58.891 --> 13:00.151
OK. FINE.

13:00.252 --> 13:01.752
TECHNICALLY, IT KIND OF
HAD TO DO WITH YOU,

13:01.853 --> 13:04.155
BUT REALLY, IT WAS MORE
ABOUT ME AND HER

13:04.255 --> 13:06.276
AND ALL THE STUFF THAT WAS
LEFT UNSAID AT CHRISTMAS, OK?

13:06.376 --> 13:07.757
I JUST WANTED
TO CLEAR THE AIR.

13:07.857 --> 13:09.438
YOU TOLD HER
ABOUT US, DIDN'T YOU,

13:09.538 --> 13:11.800
WITHOUT ANY HEADS-UP
OR INPUT FROM ME.

13:11.900 --> 13:13.321
WELL, IT DIDN'T
EXACTLY GO AS I HOPED,

13:13.420 --> 13:14.521
IF THAT MAKES YOU
FEEL BETTER.

13:14.622 --> 13:16.083
THIS IS A JOKE
TO YOU, OK?

13:16.183 --> 13:18.084
I SHOULD'VE BEEN THE ONE
TO TELL HER, LAYLA.

13:18.184 --> 13:19.485
IT'S NOT A JOKE,
JORDAN.

13:19.584 --> 13:21.366
SIMONE WAS MY FRIEND,
AND WOMAN TO WOMAN,

13:21.466 --> 13:22.607
I OWED HER
A CONVERSATION.

13:22.707 --> 13:24.208
OK. WELL, SIMONE WASN'T
JUST MY FRIEND, OK?

13:24.308 --> 13:25.329
SHE WAS MY WIFE.

13:25.429 --> 13:27.370
WOW. OK.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.452
LOOK. MY POINT IS,
IS THAT I SHOULD'VE HAD

13:29.552 --> 13:31.573
A SAY IN WHO
TELLS HER AND WHEN.

13:31.673 --> 13:34.215
WE SHOULD'VE MADE THAT
DECISION TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

13:34.314 --> 13:35.736
SIMONE AND I,
WE'RE IN A GOOD PLACE,

13:35.836 --> 13:37.297
AND NOW SHE'S
GOING TO THINK

13:37.396 --> 13:38.497
THAT I LIED TO HER
OR, WORSE,

13:38.598 --> 13:41.860
DIDN'T CARE ENOUGH
TO TELL HER PERSONALLY.

13:41.959 --> 13:43.741
WELL, CONGRATULATIONS,
YOU KNOW?

13:43.841 --> 13:45.943
I'M SO GLAD THAT YOU GOT
TO CLEAR YOUR CONSCIENCE.

13:46.043 --> 13:48.924
- JORDAN, I--
- NO. FORGET IT.

13:56.569 --> 13:57.630
YOUNG CHAPA:
♪♪ RUN IT BACK, HEY ♪♪

13:57.730 --> 13:58.751
♪♪ RUN IT BACK, HEY, HEY ♪♪

13:58.851 --> 14:00.192
♪♪ RUN IT BACK, HEY ♪♪

14:00.292 --> 14:01.713
♪♪ RUN IT BACK, RUN IT BACK,
RUN IT BACK... ♪♪

14:01.813 --> 14:05.355
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
- HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

14:05.454 --> 14:07.317
WHAT IS THIS?

14:07.417 --> 14:09.558
IT'S YOUR
BIRTHDAY ROAST.

14:09.658 --> 14:11.480
ROAST?
ON A RANDOM BIRTH--

14:11.579 --> 14:12.880
SHOULD I
BE WORRIED?

14:12.980 --> 14:14.321
- NO BIRTHDAY IS RANDOM.
- RIGHT.

14:14.420 --> 14:16.163
JUST SIT BACK
AND RELAX

14:16.263 --> 14:19.405
AND KNOW THAT, WHATEVER'S
SAID ABOUT YOU TONIGHT,

14:19.505 --> 14:20.446
THAT WE LOVE YOU.

14:20.545 --> 14:21.886
- OK.
- OK.

14:21.986 --> 14:23.286
I GOT TO GO CHECK
ON THE CATERERS.

14:23.387 --> 14:24.608
ALL RIGHT.
YOU LOOK GOOD.

14:24.708 --> 14:26.850
- LIKE MY BILLY BAKER?
- I DO.

14:26.949 --> 14:29.492
AH, THEY GOT YOU IN
ON THIS THING, TOO, HUH?

14:29.592 --> 14:31.173
THEY COULDN'T
PAY ME TO MISS IT.

14:31.273 --> 14:32.413
ALL RIGHT. NICE.

14:32.513 --> 14:33.434
PLUS, THIS TRACK SUIT
BEATS A DRESS

14:33.514 --> 14:34.855
AND HEELS ANY DAY.

14:34.954 --> 14:36.136
I WISH THEY TOLD ME
TO PUT A TRACK SUIT ON

14:36.236 --> 14:37.137
RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

14:37.237 --> 14:38.417
HA HA! HEY, LISTEN.

14:38.516 --> 14:39.898
BILLY, I WANT
TO THANK YOU

14:39.997 --> 14:42.260
FOR ALWAYS LOOKING OUT
FOR SPENCER.

14:42.360 --> 14:43.420
PLEASE.

14:43.521 --> 14:45.021
WHAT YOU DID TO HELP
KENNY GET CONSIDERED

14:45.122 --> 14:47.544
FOR THE COACHING JOB
AT GAU MEANS A LOT...

14:47.644 --> 14:49.064
OK. MM-HMM.

14:49.165 --> 14:50.626
AND, ACCORDING
TO SPENCER,

14:50.726 --> 14:51.906
IT LOOKS LIKE KENNY'LL
GET AN OFFER SOON.

14:52.006 --> 14:53.427
HE'S DEFINITELY
ON THE SHORT LIST,

14:53.526 --> 14:55.309
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW
THAT A.D. BARNES,

14:55.409 --> 14:57.550
HE'S CONSIDERING
OTHER CANDIDATES.

14:57.650 --> 14:59.430
- SERIOUSLY?
- YEAH.

14:59.531 --> 15:00.752
SPENCER
SEEMED TO THINK

15:00.852 --> 15:01.992
NO ONE ELSE
WANTED THE JOB.

15:02.093 --> 15:03.394
YOU KNOW HOW
THESE THINGS ARE.

15:03.494 --> 15:04.715
THERE'S ALWAYS
SOMEBODY ELSE IN THE MIX,

15:04.814 --> 15:06.156
SOMEBODY WHO'S
GONNA WANT TO COVER--

15:06.256 --> 15:07.557
COVER THEIR BASES.

22:39.317 --> 22:40.778
SO DOES YOUR DAD
REALLY LIKE BELLINIS,

22:40.878 --> 22:42.299
OR IS THAT
HER THING, TOO?

22:42.399 --> 22:44.221
OH, NO. THAT MAN LOVES
A GOOD, SUGARY COCKTAIL,

22:44.321 --> 22:46.102
WELL, WHEN NO ONE'S
LOOKING, OF COURSE.

22:46.202 --> 22:49.544
OUTING A MAN'S
PRIVATE DRINK, SAVAGE.

22:49.644 --> 22:51.786
[LAUGHTER]

22:51.886 --> 22:52.946
HA HA!

22:53.046 --> 22:55.148
HA HA HA!

22:55.248 --> 22:57.389
HA! HA! HA HA!

22:57.489 --> 23:00.151
WHOA. OK.
SLOW IT DOWN.

23:00.251 --> 23:01.552
IF I KNOW THAT'S
YOUR FAKE LAUGH,

23:01.652 --> 23:04.594
YOU BETTER BELIEVE
SPENCER WILL, TOO.

23:04.694 --> 23:07.676
COOP: YOU KNOW, NOT ALL OF US
GET TO LIVE OUT OUR DREAMS.

23:07.776 --> 23:09.758
I MEAN, TAKE ASHER,
FOR INSTANCE.

23:09.858 --> 23:11.679
HE WANTED TO PLAY FOOTBALL
SO BAD,

23:11.779 --> 23:14.921
BUT HE JUST DIDN'T
HAVE THE HEART FOR IT.

23:15.021 --> 23:16.682
[LAUGHTER]

23:16.782 --> 23:19.044
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
WELCOME ASHER ADAMS.

23:19.144 --> 23:22.666
[APPLAUSE]

23:23.547 --> 23:25.808
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S REAL GOOD.

23:25.908 --> 23:27.770
SHOTS FIRED, COOP,

23:27.870 --> 23:30.171
BUT I GUESS YOU GOT
YOUR VOICE BACK,

23:30.271 --> 23:33.053
NOT SO SURE
THAT'S A GOOD THING.

23:33.153 --> 23:34.414
Y'ALL ARE CUTTHROAT.

23:34.514 --> 23:38.337
AHH, A COACH
HONES YOUR STRENGTHS

23:38.437 --> 23:41.018
AND DRAWS OUT
YOUR WEAKNESSES.

23:41.118 --> 23:42.940
THEY MOLD YOU INTO
THE TYPE OF PLAYER

23:43.040 --> 23:45.662
YOU'RE GONNA BE,
OR IF YOU'RE COACH BAKER,

23:45.762 --> 23:48.704
YOU JUST RECRUIT THEM ILLEGALLY
AND MOVE THEM INTO YOUR HOUSE.

23:48.804 --> 23:50.585
[LAUGHTER]

23:50.685 --> 23:52.266
YOU STILL MAD I TOOK
YOUR SPOT, ASH?

23:52.366 --> 23:55.588
OOH, OW. HA HA!
WHO RAISED Y'ALL?

23:55.688 --> 23:57.629
[LAUGHTER]

23:57.729 --> 23:59.911
ASHER: NOW, A BAKER
IS SOMEONE WHO FINDS

24:00.011 --> 24:02.393
ALL THE RIGHT INGREDIENTS
TO MAKE THE PERFECT DESSERT.

24:02.493 --> 24:04.114
I THINK I'VE FORGOTTEN
HOW TO LAUGH.

24:04.214 --> 24:05.555
- LIFE AIN'T THAT DEEP.
- I DON'T KNOW.

24:05.655 --> 24:06.996
IT'S FELT PRETTY
DEEP LATELY.

24:07.096 --> 24:10.238
MAYBE IF YOU STOP
OVERTHINKING EVERYTHING

24:10.338 --> 24:12.439
AND JUST START DOING
WHATEVER FEELS GOOD,

24:12.539 --> 24:13.760
THINGS WILL
LIGHTEN UP.

24:13.860 --> 24:15.161
YEAH. IMPULSE
HASN'T REALLY

24:15.261 --> 24:16.722
WORKED FOR ME
IN THE PAST, SO--

24:16.822 --> 24:19.684
SO TRY HAPPINESS.

24:19.784 --> 24:21.125
RIGHT NOW,
THAT'S SIPPING

24:21.225 --> 24:22.566
ON VIRGIN BELLINIS
WHILE YOU WATCH YOUR DAD

24:22.666 --> 24:25.328
SQUIRM LIKE A TODDLER
THAT'S GOT TO TAKE A DUMP.

24:25.428 --> 24:27.649
THAT'S A VERY
SPECIFIC IMAGE.

24:27.749 --> 24:29.811
ASHER: IT'S A TRUE STORY,
RIGHT, MRS. BAKER?

24:29.911 --> 24:31.692
UM...

24:31.792 --> 24:33.774
AND YOU'RE RIGHT.

24:33.874 --> 24:35.975
[BOTH LAUGH]

24:36.075 --> 24:40.518
HEY, THERE SHE IS.

24:42.039 --> 24:43.580
OLIVIA:
HA HA!

24:43.680 --> 24:46.302
COOP: I KNOW Y'ALL WISH I WOULD
STAND UP HERE ALL NIGHT

24:46.402 --> 24:47.663
AND MAKE Y'ALL LAUGH,

24:47.763 --> 24:50.264
BUT THEY'RE NOT
PAYING ME ENOUGH,

24:50.364 --> 24:52.786
SO I'D LIKE TO WELCOME

24:52.886 --> 24:55.348
BILLY'S BETTER HALF,
THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE--

24:55.448 --> 24:56.789
SPENCER JAMES.

24:56.889 --> 24:58.890
[APPLAUSE]

25:02.012 --> 25:03.633
SHE IS JUST KIDDING,
MRS. BAKER.

25:03.733 --> 25:05.274
NO, SHE'S NOT,
BUT IT'S OK

25:05.374 --> 25:06.715
BECAUSE MOST OF THE TIME,
I LIKE YOU BETTER

25:06.815 --> 25:08.036
THAN I LIKE
BILLY, ANYWAY.

25:08.136 --> 25:09.477
HEY.

25:09.577 --> 25:11.719
SPENCER: WELL,
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

25:11.819 --> 25:13.760
AS COOP SAID,
I'M SPENCER JAMES.

25:13.860 --> 25:15.721
THE PART SHE LEFT OUT
IS THAT I AM THE SON

25:15.821 --> 25:17.202
COACH BAKER NEVER HAD.

25:17.302 --> 25:19.364
[LAUGHTER]

25:19.464 --> 25:20.645
IF YOU LOOK
AROUND THIS ROOM,

25:20.745 --> 25:22.766
IT'S CLEAR TO SEE
THAT BILLY HAS LIVED

25:22.866 --> 25:25.248
MANY LIVES AND BEEN
CALLED MANY THINGS--

25:25.348 --> 25:26.489
NOW, CAREFUL.

25:26.589 --> 25:28.730
NFL PLAYER,
PRINCIPAL,

25:28.830 --> 25:30.611
SON, FATHER,

25:30.711 --> 25:34.854
TROPHY HUSBAND,
UGLY CRYER,

25:34.954 --> 25:37.656
BAD GOLFER, AND
EVEN WORSE DANCER...

25:37.756 --> 25:39.737
[LAUGHTER]

25:39.837 --> 25:41.419
BUT NO MATTER WHAT,

25:41.519 --> 25:45.221
COACH WILL
ALWAYS BE MY FAVORITE.

25:45.321 --> 25:47.222
COACH BAKER
CHANGED MY LIFE

25:47.322 --> 25:49.064
THE DAY HE STEPPED
ON THAT FIELD AT CRENSHAW

25:49.164 --> 25:50.465
AND ASKED ME TO
COME PLAY FOR HIM.

25:50.565 --> 25:51.946
HE TOOK A CHANCE
ON SOME KID

25:52.046 --> 25:53.707
WHO LIKED TO DO
THINGS HIS OWN WAY,

25:53.807 --> 25:55.108
GET INTO FIGHTS,

25:55.208 --> 25:57.629
AND LIVE AND DIE
ON THAT FOOTBALL FIELD.

25:57.729 --> 26:00.751
THAT KID IS YOU, BY THE WAY,
BECAUSE I'M PERFECT.

26:00.851 --> 26:02.232
NO, BUT FOR REAL,

26:02.332 --> 26:03.553
THE FRIENDS
I MADE AT BEVERLY,

26:03.653 --> 26:05.274
THE KIND OF
FOOTBALL PLAYER I AM,

26:05.374 --> 26:08.316
EVEN THE MOST IMPORTANT
RELATIONSHIP IN MY LIFE

26:08.416 --> 26:11.779
CAN ALL BE TRACED
BACK TO COACH BAKER...

26:15.621 --> 26:17.082
WHICH FROM NOW ON,
IS THIS TRACK SUIT

26:17.182 --> 26:18.443
BECAUSE THIS IS FIRE.

26:18.543 --> 26:19.684
HOW YOU GONNA HOLD OUT
ON US LIKE THAT?

26:19.784 --> 26:21.205
SOME SECRETS ARE MEANT
TO BE KEPT.

26:21.305 --> 26:22.486
I GUESS SO.

26:22.586 --> 26:25.008
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, COACH.
I LOVE YOU.

26:25.108 --> 26:28.150
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

26:29.550 --> 26:31.552
LOVE YOU, TOO, MAN.

26:35.194 --> 26:36.575
ALL JOKES ASIDE,
COACH BAKER,

26:36.675 --> 26:39.257
YOU MADE ME THE PERSON
I AM TODAY.

26:39.357 --> 26:41.659
I JUST
LOVE YOU, MAN.

26:41.759 --> 26:43.700
ALL RIGHT.

26:43.800 --> 26:45.181
I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO THAT WAS.

26:45.281 --> 26:46.902
NO IDEA.

26:47.002 --> 26:49.144
COOP: AND NOW I NEED YOU GUYS
TO GIVE A BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE

26:49.244 --> 26:51.905
FOR THE BIGGEST, BADDEST
BOSS LADY I KNOW

26:52.005 --> 26:55.708
AND BILLY'S TRUE BETTER HALF--
MS. LAURA BAKER.

26:55.808 --> 26:56.949
ALL RIGHT.

26:57.049 --> 26:59.631
SMART MOVE
NOT ROASTING ME.

26:59.731 --> 27:01.312
I KNOW WHEN TO KEEP
MY MOUTH SHUT.

27:01.412 --> 27:03.193
LAURA: I THINK
WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT BILLY'S

27:03.293 --> 27:04.674
BEING A GOOD SPORT
BY LETTING US

27:04.774 --> 27:08.356
ROAST HIM TONIGHT, BUT
YOU'RE NOT DONE YET, BABE.

27:08.456 --> 27:09.477
I KNOW IT.

27:09.577 --> 27:10.918
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE MOVIE

27:11.018 --> 27:12.279
"10 THINGS
I HATE ABOUT YOU"?

27:12.379 --> 27:14.641
UGH, HOW
COULD I FORGET?

27:14.741 --> 27:16.242
LAURA: WHEN BILLY AND I
STARTED DATING,

27:16.342 --> 27:17.723
WE MUST HAVE
WATCHED IT 50 TIMES.

27:17.823 --> 27:20.204
HOURS OF MY LIFE
I WILL NEVER GET BACK.

27:20.304 --> 27:21.685
OH, PLEASE.

27:21.785 --> 27:23.807
YOU TRIED TO GROW YOUR
HAIR OUT LIKE HEATH.

27:23.907 --> 27:25.288
[LAUGHTER]

27:25.388 --> 27:27.529
YOU CAN SEE HOW WELL
THAT WORKED OUT FOR HIM.

27:27.629 --> 27:30.131
WHEN BILLY
PROPOSED TO ME,

27:30.231 --> 27:33.613
HE LISTED THE 10 THINGS
HE LOVED ABOUT ME,

27:33.713 --> 27:35.054
BUT TONIGHT'S
NOT A LOVE FEST.

27:35.154 --> 27:38.737
IT'S A ROAST, BABE,
SO THIS IS FOR YOU.

27:38.837 --> 27:40.818
I HATE THE WAY
YOU COMB YOUR HAIR

27:40.918 --> 27:43.220
WHEN YOU DON'T HAVE
ANY AT ALL.

27:43.320 --> 27:47.983
I HATE THE WAY
YOU SAY, "OK,"

27:48.083 --> 27:50.504
JUST SO YOU CAN STALL.

27:50.604 --> 27:52.706
I HATE THE WAY
YOU PACE AROUND

27:52.806 --> 27:54.347
WHEN THINGS
DON'T MAKE SENSE,

27:54.447 --> 27:56.508
AND I HATE THE WAY
YOU MANSPLAIN TO ME

27:56.608 --> 27:57.989
JUST SO
YOU CAN VENT...

27:58.089 --> 27:59.831
I HATE THAT.

27:59.931 --> 28:01.632
BUT MOST OF ALL,

28:01.732 --> 28:03.673
I DON'T HATE
ANYTHING ABOUT YOU,

28:03.773 --> 28:05.755
NOT EVEN
A LITTLE BIT AT ALL.

28:05.855 --> 28:08.476
BILLY BAKER, I'D
RATHER FIGHT WITH YOU

28:08.576 --> 28:10.838
THAN LOVE ANYONE ELSE.

28:10.938 --> 28:13.800
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, BABE.

[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

28:21.825 --> 28:23.847
COOP: NOW, GUYS,
THIS WOULD NOT BE A TRUE ROAST

28:23.947 --> 28:25.888
IF WE DID NOT
GET TO HEAR

28:25.988 --> 28:28.770
FROM THE MAN OF HONOR,
THE LEGEND HIMSELF--

28:28.870 --> 28:31.372
MR. BILLY BAKER.

28:31.472 --> 28:34.774
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]

28:34.874 --> 28:37.656
THANK YOU, COOP.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

28:37.756 --> 28:42.739
ONE OF THESE DAYS,
I HOPE TO BE AS HOOD AS YOU

28:42.839 --> 28:44.941
AS YOU SLEEP PEACEFULLY
EVERY NIGHT

28:45.041 --> 28:48.783
IN MY VERY EXPENSIVE
BEVERLY HILLS MANSION.

28:48.883 --> 28:52.265
UNTIL THAT DAY,
ENJOY THE THREAD COUNT.

28:52.365 --> 28:53.746
- YOU KNOW I WILL.
- ALL RIGHT.

28:53.846 --> 28:56.708
BILLY: WHERE IS SPENCER?
THERE YOU ARE.

28:56.808 --> 28:58.790
I KNOW HE'S FEELING PROUD OF
THAT LITTLE SPEECH YOU GAVE ME.

28:58.890 --> 29:00.551
THANK YOU.
Y'ALL DON'T KNOW THIS.

29:00.651 --> 29:04.514
SPENCER HAS A SANDWICH
NAMED AFTER HIM RIGHT HERE,

29:04.614 --> 29:07.676
YES, RIGHT HERE
AT THE SLAUSON CAFE.

29:07.776 --> 29:10.157
IT'S CUTE,
NOT AS CUTE AS HAVING

29:10.257 --> 29:12.799
AN ACTUAL FOOTBALL FIELD
NAMED AFTER YOU,

29:12.899 --> 29:14.840
BUT YOU'RE ON YOUR WAY,
BUDDY.

THERE THEY ARE--
JORDAN AND OLIVIA,

29:20.504 --> 29:22.005

29:22.105 --> 29:24.687
THESE DAYS, THEY'RE MORE
OF A PAIN IN MY NECK,

29:24.787 --> 29:27.489
MY SHOULDER,
MY LOWER BACK, RIGHT,

29:27.589 --> 29:30.371
OH, AND, OF COURSE,
MY BANK ACCOUNT.

29:30.471 --> 29:32.812
NOBODY LAUGHED AT THAT.
EXACTLY.

29:32.912 --> 29:34.934
ALL THE ADULTS KNOW
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

29:35.034 --> 29:37.936
Y'ALL DON'T KNOW THIS,
BUT FOR THE LONGEST TIME,

29:38.036 --> 29:42.699
FOR YEARS, I CALLED THEM BOTH
THING 1 AND THING 2

29:42.799 --> 29:45.341
BECAUSE RIGHT AFTER
THEY WERE BORN,

29:45.441 --> 29:48.183
TRYING TO TELL THEM APART
WAS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE

29:48.283 --> 29:51.265
UNLESS I TOOK OFF
THEIR DIAPERS.

29:51.365 --> 29:53.827
EVEN THEN,
IT WAS A LITTLE IFFY, RIGHT?

29:53.927 --> 29:57.900
HE'S FINE NOW,
BUT IT WAS IFFY.

29:58.000 --> 30:00.002
AND, OF COURSE,
MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE,

30:00.101 --> 30:01.003
WHO PUT TOGETHER
THIS WHOLE THING,

30:01.102 --> 30:02.684
I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU
THAT I LOVE YOU.

30:02.783 --> 30:04.524
- THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT. MM-HMM.
- YES. EXACTLY.

30:04.625 --> 30:08.247
AND TO THE REST OF Y'ALL--
ASH, LAYLA,

30:08.348 --> 30:10.649
AND MY MAN HERE, OK,
AND, OF COURSE,

30:10.748 --> 30:13.051
HOW COULD I FORGET YOU?--
I'M COMING FOR YOU ALL...

30:13.150 --> 30:14.691
[LAUGHTER]

30:14.792 --> 30:16.253
BECAUSE I DON'T FORGET.

30:16.352 --> 30:17.613
ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE...

30:17.714 --> 30:19.854
[CLEARS THROAT]

30:19.955 --> 30:23.298
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I DID RIGHT
TO DESERVE YOU ALL.

30:23.398 --> 30:25.859
LIKE SPENCER SAID,
I HAVE LIVED MANY LIVES,

30:25.958 --> 30:30.181
AND TO MOST OF Y'ALL,
I'M COACH BAKER,

30:30.282 --> 30:32.744
AND YOU WILL NEVER KNOW
HOW MUCH THAT MEANS TO ME.

30:32.843 --> 30:34.584
YOU ALL KNOW I GREW UP
ON THE FOOTBALL FIELD,

30:34.685 --> 30:37.306
AND IT WAS WHERE I LEARNED
HOW TO BE THE MAN,

30:37.407 --> 30:41.270
THE HUSBAND, AND THE FATHER
THAT I'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO BE,

30:41.370 --> 30:44.631
AND THOUGH I AM NOT PERFECT,

30:44.732 --> 30:48.754
I KNOW I CAN ALWAYS
COME BACK HOME TO THE FIELD

30:48.854 --> 30:50.676
WHENEVER I NEED
TO BE CENTERED,

30:50.775 --> 30:53.638
SO I THANK YOU ALL
FOR REMINDING ME OF THAT.

30:53.737 --> 30:55.238
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
THIS IS GREAT.

WHAT'S UP, LIV?

31:09.187 --> 31:11.188
YOU LOOK GREAT.

31:13.150 --> 31:15.212
YEAH. WHO KNEW
POLYESTER WAS MY THING?

31:15.312 --> 31:17.954
THAT'S WHAT
I'M SAYING, RIGHT?

31:21.315 --> 31:25.178
SO...
YOU AND NOAH.

31:25.279 --> 31:28.400
YOU AND ALICIA.

31:31.283 --> 31:34.225
UH, THIS IS STRANGE.

31:34.324 --> 31:35.825
IF YOU'D HAD TOLD ME
6 MONTHS AGO

31:35.926 --> 31:37.306
WE'D BE HAVING A
CONVERSATION LIKE THIS,

31:37.407 --> 31:39.148
I'D SAY
YOU WAS CRAZY.

31:39.247 --> 31:41.389
LIFE WAS SO MUCH
EASIER BACK THEN.

31:41.489 --> 31:44.272
AIN'T THAT
THE TRUTH?

31:44.371 --> 31:46.072
WELL, LET'S HOPE
IN 6 MONTHS,

31:46.172 --> 31:47.714
THINGS WILL BE
A LITTLE MORE NORMAL.

31:47.813 --> 31:49.475
THEN WE'LL BE
FRIENDS AGAIN

31:49.574 --> 31:51.996
LIKE IT WAS
BEFORE WE DATED?

31:52.097 --> 31:56.939
NO. THINGS WILL
NEVER BE THE SAME...

31:59.140 --> 32:00.282

32:00.381 --> 32:01.523

TO ERASE THE TIME

32:01.622 --> 32:03.043
