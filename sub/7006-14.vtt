WEBVTT

00:04.137 --> 00:06.503
Nippy out here for a barbecue,
isn't it, Wilson?

00:06.573 --> 00:09.736
[Wilson] Well, my cousins and
their friends are in town on business.

00:09.809 --> 00:14.644
l'm making veggie burgers since they
didn't care for my Armadillo Cacciatore.

00:15.215 --> 00:19.174
Your cousins are here? l'd sure like to
meet them. Are they anything like you?

00:19.285 --> 00:21.845
No, no, no, no, no, no.
They're oddballs.

00:24.657 --> 00:26.989
Hey, Wilson,
how are those veggie burgers coming?

00:27.060 --> 00:28.925
Yeah, l'm starving, cuz.

00:28.995 --> 00:30.462
Tim Taylor.

00:31.031 --> 00:34.194
Uh, Tim, these are my cousins.
This is Mike Love...

00:34.267 --> 00:36.428
...and Carl Wilson.

00:40.974 --> 00:43.875
Th... these are The Beach Boys.

00:43.943 --> 00:45.911
He never said he
was related to you guys.

00:46.012 --> 00:48.242
l never tell anybody.
Otherwise, l'd be hounded

00:48.314 --> 00:51.750
- for concert tickets and autographs.
- l know the feeling!

00:51.818 --> 00:54.946
<i>l'm a celebrity too! Tool Time. Host.</i>

00:55.021 --> 00:58.354
[hums theme song] Ha!

00:59.426 --> 01:01.189
Hey, any sign of a burger?

01:01.261 --> 01:03.695
- These are the rest of The Beach Boys.
- Yeah!

01:03.763 --> 01:07.324
This is Bruce Johnston,
and Al and Matt Jardine.

01:07.400 --> 01:11.097
Nice to see you guys.
This is just unbelievable.

01:12.806 --> 01:15.570
Wow! l mean, The Beach Boys right...

01:15.675 --> 01:17.506
Could l ask you a little favor?

01:17.577 --> 01:20.944
Hey, say no more.
Two, three, four...

01:21.014 --> 01:24.040
<i># Little surfer</i>

01:24.117 --> 01:26.813
<i># Little one</i>

01:26.886 --> 01:29.650

01:29.756 --> 01:33.214

01:33.293 --> 01:36.751

01:36.830 --> 01:40.527
<i>- # Do you, surfer... #
- That's a good song, you know.</i>

01:40.600 --> 01:43.160
But l was kinda hoping...

01:45.171 --> 01:47.264
You know, l...

01:47.340 --> 01:51.709
l really like that. But l was hoping you
could do one of your great car songs.

01:51.778 --> 01:53.541
<i>Uh, like Little G. T.O. ?</i>

01:53.646 --> 01:56.376
That wasn't our song.

01:56.449 --> 02:01.216
<i>No. [laughs] l mean
Little Old Lady from Pasadena.</i>

02:01.287 --> 02:03.312
That was Jan and Dean.

02:03.389 --> 02:05.482
<i>Um... Hey Little Cobra!</i>

02:05.558 --> 02:08.390
Sorry. Rip Chords.

02:08.461 --> 02:11.487
<i>The only one l know is Little
Deuce Coupe. You didn't do that.</i>

02:11.564 --> 02:13.191
Actually, we did.

02:14.434 --> 02:15.992
Well... and it was great.

02:16.069 --> 02:18.594
[Wilson] lt would've been
if they'd used my lyrics.

02:18.671 --> 02:20.764
- Let's not start that argument again.
- Whew!

02:20.840 --> 02:21.932
Come on. Give it up.

02:22.008 --> 02:25.466
<i>Hey. l'll show you my hot rod if you'll
sing a little of Little Deuce Coupe.</i>

02:25.545 --> 02:28.309
- What kind of car do you have?
- '46 Ford convertible.

02:28.381 --> 02:30.144
- [all] Yeah.
- All-metal body.

02:30.250 --> 02:32.480
- [all] Whoa...
- Tricked-out flathead.

02:32.552 --> 02:34.486
- [all] Cool!
- Three carburetors.

02:34.554 --> 02:35.987
[all] Three?!

02:36.055 --> 02:38.080
One, two, three...

02:38.158 --> 02:41.685

Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

04:02.909 --> 04:05.673
Ah, Dad.
l'm getting together with Lauren.

04:05.778 --> 04:08.747
What do you think? Vest?

04:09.949 --> 04:13.510
Or... no vest?

04:15.688 --> 04:21.250
Well... no vest says casual and cool.

04:21.361 --> 04:25.855
Vest says you might be trying to
impress her. You're a little desperate.

04:25.932 --> 04:28.594
Got it. Go with the vest.

04:30.236 --> 04:33.137
- Where are you and Lauren going?
- To the mall. l need new shoes,

04:33.206 --> 04:35.174
and Lauren said she wanted
to go shopping.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.574
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

04:38.645 --> 04:41.773
What does
''Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa'' mean?

04:41.848 --> 04:44.544
When a girl wants
to help you buy shoes,

04:44.617 --> 04:46.881
it means she wants
to be more than just friends.

04:46.953 --> 04:48.614
Really?

04:48.688 --> 04:51.987
Yeah. Here's how it goes.

04:52.058 --> 04:54.583
Candy store, friends.

04:54.661 --> 04:57.596
Shoe store, more than friends.

04:59.032 --> 05:02.399
Jewelry store, run for your life.

05:05.004 --> 05:06.096
[doorbell rings]

05:06.172 --> 05:08.504
Don't worry.
We're nowhere near jewelry store.

05:08.574 --> 05:12.032
Trust me,
one day you'll say the magic words:

05:12.111 --> 05:14.978
''lt looks kind of like gold,
doesn't it, honey?''

05:18.384 --> 05:19.408
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:19.485 --> 05:21.953
Hi, Randy.
l just spoke to Mrs. Blanchard

05:22.021 --> 05:25.047
and she's gonna run our article
on page one of Thursday's paper.

05:25.124 --> 05:27.991
- All right! Our first front-page story.
- lsn't this great?

05:28.061 --> 05:29.619
Yeah.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.558
- Oh! Hey, Mr. Taylor.
- Hello, Lauren. How are you?

05:34.667 --> 05:37.431
Good. So how's the hot rod coming along?

05:37.503 --> 05:40.666
Really good. Starting the hydraulics
on the convertible top.

05:40.740 --> 05:43.300
Great. Did you remember
to bleed the system?

05:43.376 --> 05:45.537
Never have to remind my dad to bleed.

05:49.849 --> 05:51.942
- Hi, sweetie.
- [Tim] Hi.

05:52.018 --> 05:55.044
Mmm. You should've seen Mark
at his lesson today. He was awesome.

05:55.121 --> 05:57.817
- Sure was.
- Well, that's my boy.

05:57.890 --> 06:00.859
l told you, you worked hard,
big things are gonna happen.

06:00.927 --> 06:03.828
You know, and it'll help you
with future things down the line.

06:03.896 --> 06:07.855
You don't have any idea
what we're talking about, do you?

06:07.934 --> 06:09.959
Not a clue.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.527
- l was at karate, Dad.
- Yeah!

06:12.605 --> 06:16.097
Yeah. Well, you work hard
at that and end up...

06:16.175 --> 06:19.338
You get a high-paying job
in the karate industry.

06:20.580 --> 06:22.639
See you. We're going
to the mall to get shoes.

06:22.715 --> 06:26.446
Oh, good. Listen,
l need to get a pair for Mark.

06:26.519 --> 06:28.453
- l'd do it, but l'm swamped.
- Come on.

06:28.521 --> 06:30.819
Lauren and l don't
want Mark hanging out with us.

06:30.890 --> 06:33.415
Hey, come on, Randy.
lt's OK. lt's no big deal.

06:33.493 --> 06:36.587
On the other hand, Mark can be fun.
Come on, buddy. Let's go, Mark.

06:36.662 --> 06:38.630
- [Lauren] Bye, Mrs. Taylor.
- [Jill] Bye.

06:38.731 --> 06:42.292
OK. So l gotta practice
for my thing tonight.

06:42.368 --> 06:45.860
Well, get upstairs and work hard
on that thing. lt'll pay off.

06:47.740 --> 06:49.002
Not a clue.

06:49.075 --> 06:50.838
<i>[high-pitched voice] Hiyah!</i>

06:54.714 --> 06:58.343
- l like the tan. What do you think?
- l like the tan.

06:59.752 --> 07:03.244
Why don't you go pick out something
in the Buster Brown section.

07:04.690 --> 07:06.851
l don't know.
l kind of like them in black.

07:06.959 --> 07:09.985
- Black it is. l'll get them.
- Wait a second. l haven't decided.

07:10.062 --> 07:12.997
[laughs] Like the guy's
opinion matters.

07:15.535 --> 07:20.063
Well, l better go. l promised
my parents l'd be home by five.

07:20.139 --> 07:23.006
- lt was kind of fun hanging out.
- Yeah, it was.

07:23.075 --> 07:26.533
Maybe next time you can help me pick out
some earrings at the jewelry store.

07:29.582 --> 07:33.643
The jewelry store. Yeah. l thought
we'd pick out a lot more shoes first.

07:34.954 --> 07:38.651
- Right. Bye.
- See ya. OK.

07:38.724 --> 07:42.091
Hey! You just stepped on my new shoes!

07:42.195 --> 07:43.355
Oh, sorry.

07:43.463 --> 07:47.524
No, see, l don't like it
when people step on my shoes.

07:47.600 --> 07:49.932
Well, me either.

07:50.002 --> 07:52.334
Which is why l feel your pain.

07:54.874 --> 07:57.707
- Pain...
- What is that, a joke?

07:57.777 --> 08:00.143
Well, not if you don't want it to be.

08:01.180 --> 08:04.411
Well, how would you like it
if someone stepped on your shoes?

08:04.484 --> 08:06.850
- Ow!
- Hey, leave him alone!

08:06.919 --> 08:09.945
- Who's this, your bodyguard?
- Back off. l can handle this guy.

08:10.022 --> 08:12.684
Oh, yeah? Well, handle this.

08:13.359 --> 08:14.485
Ow!

08:24.737 --> 08:26.568
l got him.

08:26.639 --> 08:28.903
[Randy] Uh-oh, he's coming back.
What do we do?

08:28.975 --> 08:32.308
l don't know. That's as far
as we got in karate class.

08:37.950 --> 08:42.216
The bad news? Wilson's actually mad at
his cousins because they never let him

08:42.288 --> 08:43.846
write lyrics for the band.

08:43.923 --> 08:46.653
Good news? l got the autographed picture
of The Beach Boys.

08:46.726 --> 08:49.422
Oh, right.

08:49.495 --> 08:52.020
''Dear Jill,
you're married to a great man,

08:52.098 --> 08:54.658
and you don't need any more jewelry?''

08:58.104 --> 09:00.470
l didn't say a word.

09:01.707 --> 09:05.438
That was so cool in the shoe store.
lt was like l was somebody else.

09:05.511 --> 09:10.881
And yet all those other times when we
wanted you to be someone else, nothing.

09:10.950 --> 09:14.909
- Mark, did you get some shoes?
- No. But l did save Randy's life.

09:15.021 --> 09:17.148
What are you talking about?
What happened?

09:17.223 --> 09:20.590
Don't worry. Nobody got hurt.
Some jerk in the shoe store pushed me.

09:20.693 --> 09:23.127
And then l used my karate
to knock him down.

09:23.195 --> 09:24.958
- Great!
- No, it isn't.

09:25.031 --> 09:26.589
No, it isn't.

09:27.767 --> 09:31.897
Mark, we don't let you
take karate so you can use it.

09:31.971 --> 09:33.905
Then why am l taking it?

09:33.973 --> 09:36.942
You'll have the confidence
of knowing you can defend yourself.

09:37.009 --> 09:40.672
But you shouldn't because you shouldn't
get into a situation where you have to.

09:42.048 --> 09:43.982
lt's not like he came up
behind somebody.

09:44.050 --> 09:46.211
- He was defending Randy.
- He should've done

09:46.319 --> 09:48.287
what l've told him
to do in this situation.

09:48.354 --> 09:50.481
- And what's that?
- Find an adult.

09:50.556 --> 09:54.720
- And what if there isn't one around?
- Run away.

09:55.528 --> 09:59.294
Run away? Forget karate.
Next year you're taking track.

10:03.536 --> 10:05.504
Hey, Taylor.
We need some new loafers.

10:05.605 --> 10:07.368
We're kind of afraid
to go to the mall.

10:07.473 --> 10:11.534
- Think your little brother can come?
- Yeah.

10:14.113 --> 10:17.776
Hey, Brad. Chad and Kevin found out
about what happened at the mall.

10:17.850 --> 10:21.308
l mean, how did they know?
lt's not like it's in the school paper.

10:24.690 --> 10:26.851
Alan Bishop's column.

10:29.328 --> 10:32.388
''The other day at the mall,
l spied freshman Randy Taylor

10:32.465 --> 10:35.992
shaking in his boots. Senior
Eric Zumbrum was threatening Taylor

10:36.068 --> 10:39.037
when he was saved by his little brother,
name unknown.''

10:40.806 --> 10:42.831
[laughing]

10:42.908 --> 10:46.400
Oh, man, Lauren's reading the article.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.344
So, what are you gonna do?

10:48.414 --> 10:50.245
[sighs] l don't know.

10:50.316 --> 10:53.012
l need a quiet place
to reflect on the matter.

11:00.793 --> 11:03.557
''And then like a simpering coward,

11:03.629 --> 11:07.588
Randy Taylor ran off
with his tail between his legs.''

11:08.901 --> 11:12.462
This is awful. l mean, half
the school must be making fun of him.

11:12.571 --> 11:14.937
Half would be a conservative estimate.

11:17.143 --> 11:20.806
- Hi.
- Well, honey, we saw the paper.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.849
There is nothing for you to be
ashamed of. You did nothing wrong.

11:23.916 --> 11:25.679
Even if you are, you shouldn't be

11:25.785 --> 11:28.879
because there's no shame
in being ashamed.

11:29.321 --> 11:31.016
[both] Huh?

11:32.324 --> 11:35.487
Look, guys, don't worry about it.
You know, it's no big deal.

11:35.561 --> 11:38.052
l was upset at first,
but l realized stuff happens.

11:38.130 --> 11:39.654
You just gotta move on.

11:39.732 --> 11:43.259
l can't believe you don't care
that everybody thinks you're a wimp.

11:43.335 --> 11:47.066
He's not a wimp. You know, he just
feels good enough about himself,

11:47.139 --> 11:49.107
he doesn't worry
about what others think.

11:49.175 --> 11:54.044
That's right. l wish l were as mature
as he was at that age. Or at this age.

11:56.215 --> 11:59.912
l'm really proud of you, Randy.
Guys, can you go wash up for dinner?

12:02.054 --> 12:05.217
So you really aren't mad
about Alan Bishop's column?

12:05.291 --> 12:08.522
Well, not anymore.
You know, l met him after school

12:08.594 --> 12:11.324
and l told him l didn't care
for his journalistic style.

12:11.397 --> 12:13.763
Then his nose started to bleed.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.201
Why?

12:16.302 --> 12:19.066
Because that's where
my fist happened to land.

12:20.406 --> 12:22.033
All right!

12:23.209 --> 12:26.042
Oh, Al. l almost forgot.

12:26.112 --> 12:29.047
Got that autographed picture
of The Beach Boys for your mom.

12:29.115 --> 12:32.881
Oh, wow! Thank you.
She will be so appreciative.

12:32.952 --> 12:34.920
Uh... ''To Al's mom.

12:34.987 --> 12:39.014
Our biggest fan... by a wide margin.''

12:41.427 --> 12:44.863
Did you tell them that my mother
was weight-challenged?

12:46.999 --> 12:48.864
No. l just told them what to write.

12:48.934 --> 12:52.199
Well, l can't put this on her wall now!

12:52.271 --> 12:54.705
Well, put it on the floor.
She'll never see it.

12:55.908 --> 12:58.035
Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor!
Woo-hoo!

12:58.110 --> 13:00.670
- She's losing weight.
- l know she's losing weight.

13:00.780 --> 13:02.475
l'm just joking about this...

13:02.548 --> 13:04.448
[both arguing]

13:11.323 --> 13:13.951
Hi, everybody. Hello, studio audience.

13:14.026 --> 13:16.551
<i>Welcome to Tool Time.
l am Tim ''The Tool Man'' Taylor.</i>

13:16.629 --> 13:19.598
Of course, you all know
my assistant, Al Borland.

13:19.665 --> 13:21.929
[crowd cheers]

13:22.001 --> 13:24.492
- We have a great show for you today.
- That's right.

13:24.570 --> 13:27.869
We're gonna be showing you some tools
being created down at Binford's

13:27.940 --> 13:30.067
research and development lab.

13:30.142 --> 13:36.103
By scientists who work around the clock,
ignoring both time and personal hygiene.

13:36.182 --> 13:41.643
<i>Let's give a warm Tool Time welcome
to Binford's own A.J. Sanderson!</i>

13:41.720 --> 13:43.483
[crowd cheers]

13:44.156 --> 13:45.817
A.J.

13:45.891 --> 13:48.655
You haven't been down here in a while.
You're looking good.

13:48.727 --> 13:51.195
- That hygiene joke was a joke.
- l know that, Tim.

13:51.263 --> 13:55.632
You know, the thing about us is we
both have a great sense of humor.

13:58.537 --> 14:02.166
Now, you laugh, but l'm not kidding.

14:02.241 --> 14:05.608
A.J. has the best sense of humor of
anyone down at R&D. l'll tell you that.

14:05.678 --> 14:08.044
What can l say? lt's a gift.

14:10.683 --> 14:14.710
All right. Why don't you show us a
bit about these tools you're developing?

14:14.787 --> 14:19.486
There is nothing more cutting-edge than
the new Binford air-powered scissors.

14:19.558 --> 14:20.525
[whirs]

14:20.626 --> 14:22.594
They operate on 80 PSl
of compressed air

14:22.661 --> 14:25.892
which allows the blades to close
with 70 pounds of force.

14:25.965 --> 14:29.332
Seventy pounds? That means you
could cut through fiberglass.

14:29.401 --> 14:31.767
You can cut through carpeting.
Even sheet metal.

14:31.837 --> 14:34.704
These'd be good. Next time
you lose the keys to your lunch box,

14:34.773 --> 14:36.536
you won't have to bite through it.

14:38.210 --> 14:40.974
Also brand new is our laser tape
measure, our laser levels

14:41.080 --> 14:47.041
and our combination laser shrimp
de-veiner and nose-hair clipper.

14:50.556 --> 14:52.251
Nyah!

14:52.892 --> 14:56.259
You know, my mother's birthday
is coming up soon.

15:01.500 --> 15:04.560
You guys are doing a lot with lasers.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.606
Any truth to the rumor
about a laser toilet?

15:07.706 --> 15:10.470
We're keeping a tight lid on that one.

15:13.412 --> 15:16.939
But l can show you something that
is still in the experimental stages.

15:17.016 --> 15:19.644
A high-powered laser tree pruner.

15:19.718 --> 15:22.243
Are you saying you can cut a tree limb
with a laser beam?

15:22.321 --> 15:23.583
That's right.

15:23.656 --> 15:27.285
Adjustable. That's nice.
l see you got a laser fixed up here.

15:27.359 --> 15:30.817
Now, how does it operate? l just point
it to the tree limb and say ''timber?''

15:30.896 --> 15:34.764
Press that button. You won't see
the beam. Be careful where you aim it.

15:34.833 --> 15:37.996
- All right. So...
- [fizzling]

15:48.047 --> 15:51.505
Hey, Lauren.
l've been looking all over for you.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.710
So did you hear
what l did to Alan Bishop?

15:53.786 --> 15:55.913
- Yeah, l heard.
- Pretty cool, huh?

15:55.988 --> 15:59.219
Well, that depends
on your definition of ''cool.''

15:59.291 --> 16:02.226
Well, l guess l should
have asked you this before,

16:02.294 --> 16:05.923
but what is your definition of ''cool?''

16:05.998 --> 16:08.967
Well, it's not somebody
who goes out and punches some guy

16:09.034 --> 16:10.661
just to prove how tough he is.

16:10.736 --> 16:12.829
Well, it wasn't really a punch.

16:12.905 --> 16:17.467
You know, l mean, it was more of a tap.
A nudge, really.

16:17.576 --> 16:19.669
Randy, why would you
do something like that?

16:19.745 --> 16:23.112
Well, l saw you and your friends
reading the paper and laughing at me.

16:23.215 --> 16:25.683
l just didn't want you
to think l was a wimp.

16:25.751 --> 16:28.515
Randy, we weren't laughing
at Alan Bishop's stupid column.

16:28.587 --> 16:31.351
We were laughing at a funny line
you wrote in our article.

16:31.457 --> 16:34.017
So then you never thought l was a wimp?

16:34.093 --> 16:37.529
No, but now l think you're a jerk.

16:47.773 --> 16:50.537
Wilson. Wilson!

16:50.642 --> 16:52.200
Hidy-ho, neighbor.

16:52.311 --> 16:55.940
Wilson, man, what a cool flute!
You mind if l play it?

16:56.015 --> 17:00.111
No. l would appreciate it if you would
keep your hands off my shakuhachi.

17:02.588 --> 17:06.422
Man, am l glad we only get together
with you once a year!

17:10.262 --> 17:12.423
Got kind of mad at that Beach Boy,
didn't you?

17:12.531 --> 17:14.157
[Wilson grumbles]

17:14.233 --> 17:16.758
Wilson, you gotta
let this lyric thing go.

17:16.835 --> 17:20.066
Well, l just don't understand.
Would it have been so horrible for them

17:20.138 --> 17:22.436
to have recorded one of my verses?

17:24.108 --> 17:25.770
Why is this so important to you?

17:25.844 --> 17:28.472
l just always thought
l had a flair for writing.

17:28.547 --> 17:30.515
- You do. You wrote a book.
- Yes, l did.

17:30.616 --> 17:33.517
<i>The Psycho-Physiological Indices
of Amorous Connections</i>

17:33.652 --> 17:35.916
<i>Among Termites of the Southwest.</i>

17:36.889 --> 17:40.154
And it's a great book.
l'm halfway through the title already.

17:41.193 --> 17:44.856
Well, Tim, my book sold four copies.

17:44.930 --> 17:48.366
<i>Fun, Fun, Fun sold four million.</i>

17:48.434 --> 17:52.461
Well, l think it's a fact of life people
would rather have fun than termites.

17:53.405 --> 17:55.236
The two are not mutually exclusive.

17:55.307 --> 17:58.435
Hold on a second.
Let me ask you a question here.

17:58.510 --> 18:01.411
What if one of your cousins
had come to you with suggestions

18:01.480 --> 18:04.381
- about things to put in your book?
- Well, don't be ridiculous.

18:04.450 --> 18:07.817
Why would l go to The Beach Boys
for their views on entomology?

18:09.822 --> 18:13.883
Ahhh. Mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

18:13.959 --> 18:17.986
And why would they come to me
about writing surfer songs?

18:18.063 --> 18:21.726
[Tim] Uh, mm-hm. Mm-hm. Mm-hm.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.165
lf l'm gonna write songs,

18:23.268 --> 18:26.237
l should just write about things
l know... like termites.

18:26.338 --> 18:29.899
<i>- There you go!
- Mm-hm. Wood Vibrations.</i>

18:31.343 --> 18:34.005
<i>- Wood-n't It Be Nice.
- [Wilson laughs]</i>

18:34.079 --> 18:36.309
<i>- Help Me, Rodent.
- Ah.</i>

18:45.991 --> 18:48.892
Hey, great news!
l gave Wilson some advice.

18:48.961 --> 18:51.521
l think he may patch things up
with The Beach Boys.

18:51.597 --> 18:54.122
Great. Maybe your advice
could help me with Lauren.

18:55.634 --> 18:57.659
All right. Here it is.

18:57.736 --> 19:01.900
lf all you know is termites,
don't go surfing in Kokomo.

19:06.044 --> 19:08.512
Perhaps that doesn't apply here.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.847
Well, what happened?

19:12.985 --> 19:16.944
Lauren's mad at me
'cause l punched out Alan Bishop.

19:17.055 --> 19:19.615
- You hit somebody?
- Well, it didn't start out that way.

19:19.725 --> 19:22.694
- How did it start out?
- l asked him to print a retraction.

19:22.794 --> 19:25.319
He started laughing and pushing me.
l shoved him back.

19:25.397 --> 19:28.366
And the next thing l know,
the kid's bleeding from his nose.

19:28.467 --> 19:31.334
You gave him a bloody nose?
Well, l gotta call his parents now.

19:31.403 --> 19:34.372
No, Dad, come on! l already apologized.

19:34.473 --> 19:37.237
This isn't like you.
You're smarter than this. Fights?

19:37.309 --> 19:39.174
- What's this all about?
- Dad, l know.

19:39.244 --> 19:42.145
There were a bunch of kids around
and l didn't want it to get back

19:42.214 --> 19:43.545
to Lauren that l was a wimp.

19:43.615 --> 19:46.641
Well, roughing up somebody
is no way to impress a girl.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.811
lt didn't impress Lauren.

19:48.887 --> 19:51.321
Let's face it, Dad.
l know nothing about women.

19:51.390 --> 19:53.756
Well, join the club.

19:55.427 --> 19:58.396
All l know about women
is l've been ticking them off for years.

20:03.235 --> 20:06.136
Well, l didn't even get started
with Lauren and now it's over.

20:06.205 --> 20:08.036
No, no, no, no, no, no.

20:08.106 --> 20:11.473
Another thing l know about women
is that they'll give you another chance.

20:11.577 --> 20:13.943
Come on, your mom's
given me 1 0,000.

20:15.147 --> 20:17.775
l know what l should do.
l should go to Lauren and just beg.

20:17.849 --> 20:20.818
No! You're only 1 4 years old.

20:20.886 --> 20:23.912
lf you start begging now,
you'll have nothing to look forward to.

20:28.126 --> 20:31.653
''Real Men Don't Hit. By Randy Taylor.

20:31.730 --> 20:34.290
Real men don't hit.
They roll with the punches.''

20:34.366 --> 20:38.132
''ln a moment of humiliation,
l lashed out and struck my fellow man.

20:38.203 --> 20:41.832
But now l realize that violence
is not the answer.''

20:41.907 --> 20:45.070
This is great, Randy.
She's gonna think you really mean this.

20:47.746 --> 20:50.681
- Dad, l do.
- Even better.

20:52.084 --> 20:57.215
''l learned the error of my ways
from the wisdom of my father...''

20:57.289 --> 20:59.154
Much better.

21:00.892 --> 21:05.261
''...a man who's humiliated himself more
than any human being on the planet.''

21:09.768 --> 21:13.135
- Say cheese.
- [all] Cheese.

21:13.639 --> 21:16.870
- [Wilson] All right.
- Hi, Wilson. Hi, Beach Boys.

21:17.376 --> 21:19.105
[all] Hidy-ho.

21:19.177 --> 21:22.613
Um, guys, l hope you don't mind,
but l was kinda thinking that...

21:22.681 --> 21:24.444
- Want us to sing a song?
- Not just that.

21:24.549 --> 21:26.881
- l'd like to sing with you.
- OK. So, you want to...?

21:26.952 --> 21:29.978
<i>l'd like to pick the song. Barbara Ann?</i>

21:30.055 --> 21:31.420
- Anything else?
- Key of G.

21:31.523 --> 21:32.854
Oh.

21:32.924 --> 21:37.361
- [blows tuner]
- OK. Ahem.

21:37.429 --> 21:40.296
<i># Ba ba ba ba Barbara Ann</i>

21:40.365 --> 21:43.095
<i># Ba ba ba ba Barbara Ann</i>

21:43.168 --> 21:46.103
