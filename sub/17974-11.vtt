from Satan's butt crack,

01:45.906 --> 01:48.140
Aw, Malcolm's dad going all
gangster. I loves this show.

01:48.142 --> 01:50.709
It's not about
being gangster.

01:50.711 --> 01:54.079
It's about a desperate man
facing his own mortality

01:54.081 --> 01:56.715
who's forced to do
what he must to maintain

01:56.717 --> 01:59.885

01:59.887 --> 02:00.919

09:11.318 --> 09:13.218
Yeah, in the back
of your (beep) head.

09:14.153 --> 09:15.820
<i>Mamma mia.</i>

09:15.822 --> 09:18.857
Rallo, I think I've been
too hard on you,

09:18.859 --> 09:20.559
so as a treat,

09:20.561 --> 09:22.360
I brought over the current
season of  <i>Breaking Bad.</i>

09:22.362 --> 09:24.396
(chuckles):
DeVon!

09:24.398 --> 09:26.064
Now, I've edited it
down to the scenes

09:26.066 --> 09:28.033
that are appropriate
for a five-year-old,

09:28.035 --> 09:30.835
so it's 40 seconds long and
is mostly desert exterior
shots.

09:30.837 --> 09:31.535
Oh, yeah?

09:31.537 --> 09:32.103
Edit this.

09:32.105 --> 09:34.406
Whoa, you're good.

09:34.408 --> 09:35.540
Well, this is
better than nothing.

09:35.542 --> 09:37.342
Let's watch.

09:37.344 --> 09:39.744
No, this DVD is a reward for
when you finish your homework.

09:39.746 --> 09:43.214
I don't want to do my
homework.

09:43.216 --> 09:45.650
I want to drink a damn beer
and watch TV!

09:48.921 --> 09:50.689
(muttering)

09:53.025 --> 09:55.927
DONNA:
Is that you, baby?

09:55.929 --> 09:56.695
How'd it go?

09:56.697 --> 09:59.197
I don't think this country

09:59.199 --> 10:02.400
is looking for
a hard-working man anymore.

10:02.402 --> 10:03.935
Aw, my poor Cleveland.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.105
Junior, bring your
father his slippers!

10:07.107 --> 10:10.208
(panting)

10:10.210 --> 10:12.277
Rallo, go get him
a sandwich.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.779
Tell the unemployed bum
to get it himself.

10:14.781 --> 10:17.482
Because of him, I'm eating
generic sandwich cookies

10:17.484 --> 10:19.417
and drinking water
out the tap.

10:19.419 --> 10:20.919
You hush your mouth!

10:20.921 --> 10:24.055
Cleveland's been
rejected every single day.

10:24.057 --> 10:26.625
He will not be
rejected in his own house.

10:26.627 --> 10:28.226
That's a man there!

10:28.228 --> 10:31.796
Made of sweat and tears
and dreams and hopes,

10:31.798 --> 10:35.400
cooking in the gumbo of
a thousand disappointments.

10:35.402 --> 10:36.935
Never letting on
when the pain gets too great.

10:36.937 --> 10:39.337
'Cause even when
the giant gorilla of life

10:39.339 --> 10:43.742
keeps throwing barrels
down at him, and his old,
tired,

10:43.744 --> 10:46.578
stubby legs haven't got
the strength to jump,

10:46.580 --> 10:50.482
and there's no sledgehammer in
sight, he's still a man to us.

10:50.484 --> 10:53.752
Not a bird, not a puma,
but a man.

10:53.754 --> 10:58.990
With three M's,
because he's a m-m-man!

10:58.992 --> 11:00.125
What is he?!

11:00.127 --> 11:01.159
ALL:
A m-m-man.

11:01.161 --> 11:03.595
What isn't he?

11:03.597 --> 11:04.963
A puma?
A bird?

11:04.965 --> 11:05.463
Did anyone say puma?

11:05.465 --> 11:06.965
Damn right!

11:06.967 --> 11:10.502
And the least we can do
is give him a smile

11:10.504 --> 11:12.303
and a bowl of soup
and tell him,

11:12.305 --> 11:13.538
"You're doing fine, baby,"

11:13.540 --> 11:15.006
(sobs) even though
to this cruel world,

11:15.008 --> 11:18.443
he ain't worth
more than a meatball

11:18.445 --> 11:19.277
that rolled behind the fridge!

11:19.279 --> 11:22.280
(sobbing)

11:22.282 --> 11:24.983
So if one were to look
behind the fridge right now,

11:24.985 --> 11:25.950
there would be a meatball?

11:25.952 --> 11:27.986
When are you gonna
tell Cleveland

11:27.988 --> 11:29.954
about the second job you took?

11:29.956 --> 11:31.956
Never! He has enough burdens
without having to worry
about me

11:31.958 --> 11:35.326
working graveyard
at the airport.

11:35.328 --> 11:38.563
Wheels up in ten minutes!
Tea time's over, ladies!

11:38.565 --> 11:40.131
Hitch up your skirts

11:40.133 --> 11:42.634
and let's get these bags
on that bird!

11:42.636 --> 11:43.134
(grunting)

11:43.136 --> 11:45.904
(ticking)

11:50.509 --> 11:53.344
Junior, I need your help.

11:53.346 --> 11:55.480
Roberta's new boyfriend
is a pain in my...

11:55.482 --> 11:58.316
(sighs) rear end.

11:58.318 --> 12:00.485
He won't let me say the
A-word.

12:00.487 --> 12:02.320
Even worse, when the guy
shakes hands,

12:02.322 --> 12:04.656
he actually
regular shakes hands.

12:04.658 --> 12:06.424
He doesn't do the
dip-dap-hug-pull-in-elbow-

12:06.426 --> 12:08.059
bump-ear-kiss?

12:08.061 --> 12:10.161
No, man. He's even making me
tuck in my T-shirts.

12:10.163 --> 12:14.065
Like, all the way in.
Into my under-ma-pants.

12:14.067 --> 12:16.234
I never thought
I'd say this,

12:16.236 --> 12:18.002
but things were better
when Federline was around.

12:18.004 --> 12:19.771
Where is he?

12:19.773 --> 12:21.740
He's right there, running
the gardening club.

12:23.275 --> 12:24.876
This lemon sage
is coming in nicely.

12:24.878 --> 12:27.278
Must be all that southern
light.

12:27.280 --> 12:28.713
Federline?

12:28.715 --> 12:29.414
It's Gabriel Friedman
now, yo.

12:29.416 --> 12:31.549
I mean, Rallo.

12:31.551 --> 12:33.518
What happened to you?

12:33.520 --> 12:36.755
DeVon happened to me.
I can't compete with that guy.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.690
Roberta was right about me.
I was a joke.

12:38.692 --> 12:41.793
You were and you are.

12:41.795 --> 12:43.962
But I need you two
to get back together,

12:43.964 --> 12:45.530
and she's never gonna
take you back looking

12:45.532 --> 12:48.767
like a nerdy... J-O-O.

12:48.769 --> 12:50.735
Sorry, Rallo.
That's all behind me.

12:50.737 --> 12:52.370
Now if you'll excuse me,

12:52.372 --> 12:53.238
I have to go complain
about my back.

12:53.240 --> 12:55.106
(groans)

13:00.312 --> 13:02.113
Here you are, sir.
Duck confit.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.448
I only have nine dollars.

13:03.450 --> 13:05.316
I knew that coming here.

13:05.318 --> 13:09.420
Dude, you already MC Hammered
all your severance cash?

13:09.422 --> 13:11.956
Turns out, six months' salary
doesn't go as far

13:11.958 --> 13:14.292
as you'd think when
you only eat duck confit.

13:14.294 --> 13:18.329
So, now that you're broke,
I'm fixing to reckon to figure

13:18.331 --> 13:19.931
you're gonna need
to find a job.

13:19.933 --> 13:21.332
Maybe I can find
a job here.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.903
I mean, Donna got a job here.
How hard can it be?

13:24.905 --> 13:28.006
Donna got a job here!
And is here!

13:28.008 --> 13:30.108
Pam, can you refill
the waters on my four-top?

13:30.110 --> 13:33.111
I'm in the weeds
and I'm loaded up on oxy

13:33.113 --> 13:34.679
for my herniated disk.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.614
I admire you
so much, Donna.

13:36.616 --> 13:39.784
Working three jobs just
to support your family.

13:39.786 --> 13:41.820
Don't talk to me.
We're not friends.

13:41.822 --> 13:44.189
I guess since I told her
I lost my income,

13:44.191 --> 13:47.091
she jumped to the conclusion
that she had to earn
more money!

13:47.093 --> 13:50.028
If she sees me, it's gonna be
boom-boom-bye-bye-punch-face!

13:55.367 --> 13:59.437
This place is a glass circle.
There's nowhere to hide!

14:03.843 --> 14:05.443
Cleveland?!

14:05.445 --> 14:07.345
What are you doing
out there?!

14:07.347 --> 14:09.180
I thought you were
looking for a job!

14:09.182 --> 14:10.381
What the hell
is going on?!

14:10.383 --> 14:14.185
I-I'm out here
on this ledge because...

14:14.187 --> 14:16.688
because there are no jobs,
and it's hopeless,

14:16.690 --> 14:18.223
and I'm going to jump!

14:18.225 --> 14:19.657
(gasps)

14:19.659 --> 14:21.392
That's right!

14:21.394 --> 14:23.862
You're looking at a
desperate, handsome man

14:23.864 --> 14:26.164
who can't think of
any other options

14:26.166 --> 14:27.799
at this
particular point!

14:32.071 --> 14:35.640
That's right,
the economy did this to me!

14:35.642 --> 14:39.377
And if someone doesn't give me
a job soon, I'm gonna jump!

14:39.379 --> 14:42.380
Excuse me, pi...
I mean, Officer.

14:42.382 --> 14:43.581
That's my husband
Cleveland.

14:43.583 --> 14:45.650
You've got to let me
back up there.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.851
Ma'am, I'm gonna
need you to step back

14:46.853 --> 14:48.486
and take this
breath strip.

14:48.488 --> 14:50.889
He's not suicidal.

14:50.891 --> 14:53.258
He's just a victim
of the economy, man.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.726
Like me.
No one will hire me

14:54.728 --> 14:58.696
just because I have long hair
and I'm a sexual predator.

14:58.698 --> 15:00.498
I can't get a job either!

15:00.500 --> 15:02.867
He stands for all of us!
He's our hero!

15:02.869 --> 15:04.535
Yeah, it doesn't
take much!

15:04.537 --> 15:06.771
CROWD (chanting):
Cleveland! Cleveland!

15:06.773 --> 15:09.274
Wow, they're chanting for me.

15:09.276 --> 15:10.041
I'm their hero.

15:10.043 --> 15:12.277
I knew this day would come.

15:12.279 --> 15:14.579
I always thought I'd be
on stage playing sax

15:14.581 --> 15:16.681
with the E Street Band,

15:16.683 --> 15:18.883
especially after the big man
went down.

15:18.885 --> 15:20.184
But I'm okay being a hero

15:20.186 --> 15:23.621
to a bunch of filthy,
lazy hippies.

15:23.623 --> 15:26.457
You are my people!

15:26.459 --> 15:28.760
Cleveland! Cleveland!
Cleveland!

15:28.762 --> 15:33.031
Me-e! Me-e! Me-e!

15:33.232 --> 15:36.401
Hmm.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.504
The flyer said this was
the discount yarmulke
warehouse.

15:40.906 --> 15:41.739
What is this place?

15:41.741 --> 15:44.042
A tribute to your people.

15:47.546 --> 15:48.746
You've lost your way,
Federline.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.716
And we're here to help you
get back in touch

15:51.718 --> 15:53.284
with who you pretended to be.

15:53.286 --> 15:55.286
Just like these
innovators.

15:55.288 --> 15:57.055
MC Serch from 3rd Bass,

15:57.057 --> 15:58.289
The Beastie Boys,

15:58.291 --> 15:59.891
and Robert Van Winkle.

15:59.893 --> 16:02.794
But you might hate him
as Vanilla Ice.

16:02.796 --> 16:05.930
It's these brave pioneers
who repaved the way

16:05.932 --> 16:09.467
for suburban white boys like
you to adopt our culture.

16:09.469 --> 16:12.670
And not just music.
The world of film...

16:12.672 --> 16:14.605
politics...

16:14.607 --> 16:16.407
and outer space.

16:16.409 --> 16:20.345
But Neil Armstrong was the
first man to walk on the moon.

16:20.347 --> 16:23.314
Uh-uh!
Commander Dickie Darnell was.

16:23.316 --> 16:26.484
Black people been on the moon
since the early '30s.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.919
Who's that hep cat?

16:29.288 --> 16:31.456
Your father, Gabriel.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.325
(gasps) Dad?

16:34.327 --> 16:37.695
Yes, otherwise known
as Jimmy JJ Poitier,

16:37.697 --> 16:40.498
which was the name I
went by until 1980,

16:40.500 --> 16:43.301
when I was shot coming
out of a Waffle House.

16:43.303 --> 16:45.303
I'm second-generation wannabe?

16:45.305 --> 16:47.171
That's right!

16:47.173 --> 16:49.941
Don't be ashamed of
being someone you're not.

16:49.943 --> 16:52.143
Enjoy it, because
soon enough,

16:52.145 --> 16:53.811
some woman with
pretty freckles

16:53.813 --> 16:55.947
that later turn into
Morgan Freeman freckles

16:55.949 --> 16:58.516
is going to come along
and turn you into

16:58.518 --> 17:01.686
who you really are,
which is me.

17:01.688 --> 17:02.854
You're right!

17:02.856 --> 17:05.156
I gotta re-Fedify!

17:05.158 --> 17:06.791
One step ahead of you.

17:14.166 --> 17:15.967
Big ups, Rallo and
Jiggy Jiggy Junior!

17:15.969 --> 17:19.804
I'm blap in action!
(whoops)

17:19.806 --> 17:22.073
Ugh! I'm already done
with this.

17:23.976 --> 17:25.209
(siren wailing)

17:25.211 --> 17:28.212
The real tragedy is
there are kids here

17:28.214 --> 17:30.415
who should be in school,
staying away from drugs,

17:30.417 --> 17:32.550
eating their vegetables
and going to bed early.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.485
Your boyfriend is
hot and boring.

17:34.487 --> 17:37.722
I wonder if all these
food vendors have licenses.

17:37.724 --> 17:39.357
Oh, God.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.592
(beatboxing)

17:41.594 --> 17:42.994
Federline? What are
you doing here?

17:42.996 --> 17:46.230
I'm here
to get you back, Ro.

17:46.232 --> 17:49.033
You said I'm a joke, but
who doesn't like a good joke?

17:49.035 --> 17:52.170
I don't like a good joke.
They tend to be hurtful.

17:52.172 --> 17:54.572
Roberta, you got years
before you have

17:54.574 --> 17:56.274
to settle for some
doo-doo butt chump

17:56.276 --> 17:57.775
you got nothing
in common with.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.777
(sighs)
It's true.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.179
Officer? Officer?

18:01.181 --> 18:03.247
There's litter.
Right there.

18:10.522 --> 18:11.556
Rah!
(screams)

18:11.558 --> 18:12.790
Ha, just messing with you.

18:12.792 --> 18:13.591
Here are those guys
you asked to see.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.960
Demanded.

18:15.962 --> 18:18.062
Guys, thank God
you're here.

18:18.064 --> 18:20.064
Listen carefully.

18:20.066 --> 18:24.635
I need you to see how cool
this is from up here!

18:24.637 --> 18:26.404
Cleveland, you have
to come down.

18:26.406 --> 18:28.439
This whole thing
is built on a lie.

18:28.441 --> 18:31.876
Yes, but I represent
a larger truth.

18:31.878 --> 18:34.245
We are the forgotten!

18:34.247 --> 18:37.648
And I'm not coming down until
every one of us has a job!

18:37.650 --> 18:40.618
(cheering)

18:40.620 --> 18:43.621
Making a million dollars
a year!

18:43.623 --> 18:45.423
(cheering)

18:45.425 --> 18:48.292
See, fellas? This is
what I was born to do.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.495
Nothing can
stop me now.

18:50.497 --> 18:54.065
Call me the  <i>Titanic,</i>
<i>'cause I'm unsinka...</i>

18:54.067 --> 18:55.600
WATERMAN (over bullhorn):
Cleveland!

18:55.602 --> 18:58.469
Don't do this!
I'll give you your job back.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.505
All you have to do
is give back

19:00.507 --> 19:01.973
the six-month severance
I gave you.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.942
What?!
Severance?!

19:04.944 --> 19:06.344
Yes. In cash.

19:06.346 --> 19:07.979
He volunteered
for it.

19:07.981 --> 19:09.847
I assumed everything
was fine based on

19:09.849 --> 19:11.449
his constant
Twitter updates

19:11.451 --> 19:14.819
on how he was spending the
money and not looking
for a job.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.754
Hashtag "oops."

19:16.756 --> 19:18.422
Cleveland, is this bitch
for real?!

19:18.424 --> 19:19.757
Yes.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.293
(crowd booing)

19:22.295 --> 19:25.863
Hold on, hold on,
I can explain!

19:25.865 --> 19:28.766
Yes, I lied.
And I'm sorry, Donna.

19:28.768 --> 19:33.671
And I wasn't looking for
a job, I was acting like
a slob,

19:33.673 --> 19:37.308
and now I look like a knob
in front of this mob.

19:37.310 --> 19:41.179
Sorry, I was doing
a Jesse Jackson,

19:41.181 --> 19:43.781
trying to rhyme
my way out of this.

19:43.783 --> 19:45.316
Look, I know I've done wrong.

19:45.318 --> 19:49.320
But come on, who among you
would take six-months salary

19:49.322 --> 19:51.289
and look for work
the next day?

19:51.291 --> 19:53.491
I took a little time
for myself.

19:53.493 --> 19:56.360
You know how when you get back
from vacation,

19:56.362 --> 19:57.895
you say you need
another vacation?

19:57.897 --> 19:59.897
(crowd murmuring)

19:59.899 --> 20:01.032
RALLO:
Wrap it up.

20:01.034 --> 20:04.702
I say we, the 99 percents,

20:04.704 --> 20:06.904
should all go on vacations,

20:06.906 --> 20:09.707
and we should do it
by taxing the one percents!

20:09.709 --> 20:12.143
(cheering)

20:12.145 --> 20:15.179
You hear those cheers, Donna?

20:15.181 --> 20:16.347
Donna?

20:16.349 --> 20:17.348
Right here.
Yah!

20:17.350 --> 20:19.750
All right, I guess
you're really gonna

20:19.752 --> 20:21.819
let me have it once
I'm safely on the...

20:21.821 --> 20:22.987
Boom-boom-bye-bye-
punch-face!

20:22.989 --> 20:26.757
I'll sue you...!

20:31.163 --> 20:33.030
Nice aim with the crash pad.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.566
There was a crash pad?

20:35.568 --> 20:37.168
CLEVELAND:
<i>I did sue Donna.</i>

20:37.170 --> 20:37.935
<i>She had to keep</i>
<i>those extra jobs</i>

20:37.937 --> 20:41.172
<i>for a while to pay me off.</i>

20:41.174 --> 20:42.740
<i>I was then able</i>
<i>to use that money</i>

20:42.742 --> 20:45.843
<i>to pay back</i>
<i>my ill-gotten severance</i>

20:45.845 --> 20:47.278
<i>to Mr. Waterman,</i>
<i>who was gracious enough</i>

20:47.280 --> 20:50.581
<i>to give me my old job back...</i>

20:50.583 --> 20:53.317
