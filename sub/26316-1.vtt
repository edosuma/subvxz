WEBVTT

00:04.547 --> 00:07.759
I still believe that they
would've become good people

00:08.009 --> 00:12.097
if they'd just gotten a push
in the right direction.

00:13.890 --> 00:14.974
Oh, no!

00:15.100 --> 00:18.561
It's only four people,
and it's clearly the best way to see

00:18.853 --> 00:21.439
if bad people can become good
without knowing anything

00:21.481 --> 00:23.358
about what's waiting for them
in the afterlife.

00:25.944 --> 00:27.487
- OK, let's do it.
- Yes!

00:27.570 --> 00:31.241
But there have to be strict rules.
Otherwise, the results will be tainted.

00:31.366 --> 00:35.286
And I reserve the right to change my mind
at any point.

00:35.411 --> 00:37.997
Would someone who's not an eternal being
please explain to me

00:38.123 --> 00:38.998
what the f--

01:08.444 --> 01:09.821
Hi. I'm Michael.

01:11.030 --> 01:12.448
You must be the Doorman?

01:14.826 --> 01:15.702
Ah!

01:16.286 --> 01:17.412
This is wild.

01:17.829 --> 01:19.706
Had no idea this was even here.

01:20.290 --> 01:23.543
So, I have this ruling from the Judge...

01:23.751 --> 01:27.338
heading on down to Earth
to reverse the deaths of these four people.

01:27.547 --> 01:30.216
It's kinda tricky, you know,
it starts up a new timeline

01:30.300 --> 01:31.843
so there might be some ripple effects

01:32.260 --> 01:35.471
but it's necessary, for the...
the experiment that we're doing there.

01:37.307 --> 01:38.975
So how long does this trip take?

01:39.058 --> 01:40.727
Hope I don't get a middle seat.

01:40.852 --> 01:42.562
Wow.

01:43.271 --> 01:45.565
I haven't heard a joke in 8,000 years.

01:46.774 --> 01:48.151
And I still haven't.

01:49.652 --> 01:50.862
That's the door to Earth.

01:51.321 --> 01:53.406
Go through there,
you'll be wherever you need to be.

01:53.489 --> 01:54.908
You won't have any other powers, though.

01:54.949 --> 01:57.285
You wanna get around, you're just gonna
have to take a bus or something.

01:57.744 --> 01:58.786
A bus?

01:59.454 --> 02:00.705
Oh, boy!

02:00.914 --> 02:03.374
Oh, man, I'm gonna sit
in a front-facing seat!

02:03.416 --> 02:06.085
Or no, no, m-maybe a sideways-facing seat!

02:06.169 --> 02:08.213
I'm... I'm gonna get so motion-sick!

02:08.671 --> 02:09.797
Oh, man!

02:10.173 --> 02:11.674
What do I do, just grab the key here...?

02:11.716 --> 02:12.717
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:12.842 --> 02:17.931
This key is made of the very first atoms
that came into existence in the universe.

02:18.056 --> 02:21.893
It is one of a kind,
and cannot be duplicated. See?

02:23.102 --> 02:25.313
"Do not duplicate."

02:26.147 --> 02:27.482
Only I touch this key.

02:27.565 --> 02:29.943
And... and what's the significance
of the keychain?

02:30.318 --> 02:32.070
Nothing. I just like frogs.

02:32.195 --> 02:33.238
I'm a frog guy.

02:34.030 --> 02:38.326
When you need to get back here,
make sure you're alone, press this button.

02:39.035 --> 02:41.037
Any questions? No? Great.

02:42.622 --> 02:43.790
Knock yourself out.

02:49.003 --> 02:49.879
Uh-oh.

03:00.890 --> 03:03.059
I-I'm sorry, but this is an
important moment in our friendship--

03:03.101 --> 03:04.269
On your right, mate!

03:04.352 --> 03:05.520
Geez! Watch it, man!

03:09.274 --> 03:11.526
Come down to the ground where you belong!

03:14.737 --> 03:15.989
<i>Buongiorno!</i>

03:16.864 --> 03:18.157
<i>Buongiorno!</i>

03:22.787 --> 03:24.455
Oh, wow!

03:24.789 --> 03:26.791
I was just on Earth!

03:27.208 --> 03:28.418
It was incredible!

03:28.793 --> 03:31.879
The-the traffic... the pigeons!

03:32.005 --> 03:35.550
And I saw this place that was at once
a Pizza Hut

03:35.633 --> 03:37.218
<i>and</i> a Taco Bell!

03:37.635 --> 03:41.306
I mean, oh... the mind reels!

03:42.015 --> 03:46.436
A Pizza Hut <i>and</i> a Taco Bell! Ah!

03:53.192 --> 03:55.903
Oh, Janet,
it was everything I ever imagined.

03:55.987 --> 03:57.280
I got to ride a bike.

03:57.447 --> 04:00.241
I put a coin in a thing and got a gumball.

04:00.575 --> 04:03.411
And then someone came up to me and said,
"Hot enough for ya?"

04:03.536 --> 04:04.495
And you know what I said?

04:04.537 --> 04:06.289
I said, "Tell me about it."

04:06.414 --> 04:08.791
While I am glad
that you got to chew a gumball...

04:08.833 --> 04:10.251
Oh, damn.

04:10.793 --> 04:12.503
I didn't even think to chew it.

04:13.504 --> 04:15.006
Missed opportunity. Shoot.

04:15.214 --> 04:17.050
...did you also save their lives?

04:17.133 --> 04:19.469
Yes, of course. Everyone is safe.

04:20.303 --> 04:21.262
Including Jason.

04:22.221 --> 04:26.225
Now, just sit back
and watch as they become better people.

04:27.435 --> 04:29.020
Being good is for suckers!

04:29.103 --> 04:31.064
What do you even get out of it? I quit.

04:31.230 --> 04:33.232
Eat my farts, Benedict Cumberbatch.

04:35.735 --> 04:37.403
Morning, Chidi!
Blueberry muffin for ya?

04:37.487 --> 04:38.654
Uh... I-I don't know.

04:38.738 --> 04:39.697
Maybe. I can't decide.

04:39.906 --> 04:41.532
- You alright there, mate?
- OK.

04:41.908 --> 04:42.909
I've made my decision.

04:43.576 --> 04:44.952
I want to...

04:45.370 --> 04:47.246
start crying!

04:54.420 --> 04:58.216
Hey, Tahani Al-Jamil.
I'm from International Sophisticate Magazine.

04:58.257 --> 05:00.468
Mind if we ask you 582 questions?

05:00.593 --> 05:01.636
Sounds delightful!

05:02.011 --> 05:03.388
Where are we, exactly?

05:03.471 --> 05:06.474
My pied-à-terre,
just off the coast of Barcelona.

05:06.641 --> 05:08.935
What's one thing
people don't know about you?

05:09.018 --> 05:11.562
That I was such a tomboy in high school.

05:11.771 --> 05:12.647
See?

05:12.855 --> 05:15.400
Wow! Looking good! OK, next question.

05:15.733 --> 05:18.569
Who would you say is the most famous person
in your phone?

05:18.653 --> 05:22.448
It's not about "who you know."
Enlightenment comes from within.

05:24.325 --> 05:25.993
The Dalai Lama texted me that.

05:29.622 --> 05:32.750
Kay, will you make me the happiest man
in the world

05:32.792 --> 05:34.502
and agree to be my wife?

05:35.461 --> 05:36.462
No.

05:37.088 --> 05:39.507
Do you think my name is the letter "K"?

05:39.632 --> 05:42.468
Just say yes! If we're married,
legally you can't arrest me.

05:42.677 --> 05:44.971
Plus, bonus,
you get half the stuff I stole!

05:45.721 --> 05:47.682
Yeah, he just confessed to the robbery.

05:48.057 --> 05:49.016
Dammit!

05:53.646 --> 05:56.190
You realise what the problem is, right?

05:56.315 --> 05:57.942
Yes, but there's no way to help.

06:02.738 --> 06:03.656
Maybe there is.

06:03.781 --> 06:07.493
In the afterlife, they all got better
because they helped each other.

06:08.286 --> 06:10.955
And the key to that
was Chidi and Eleanor's connection.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.583
If I get the two of them together,
everything else will follow.

06:13.624 --> 06:15.960
- Michael, no--
- I'm gonna meet Eleanor someplace

06:16.002 --> 06:19.714
and plant the idea in her mind
that she needs to find Chidi.

06:19.922 --> 06:21.757
Oh, and then maybe I'll visit Chidi

06:21.799 --> 06:24.093
and make sure that he helps her
when she shows up.

06:24.343 --> 06:25.845
I'm just gonna nudge
the two of them together.

06:25.887 --> 06:27.013
Just nudgey-nudge-nudge.

06:27.096 --> 06:29.474
The Judge was pretty clear
in her instructions

06:29.557 --> 06:32.393
and the Judge is, you know, the Judge

06:32.560 --> 06:35.646
of, you know, The Universe.

06:36.022 --> 06:37.106
She'll never find out.

06:37.190 --> 06:40.568
She spends all her time in her chambers
bingeing TV shows.

06:40.651 --> 06:43.029
She's watching all of "N.C.I.S." right now!

06:45.490 --> 06:46.365
Hey, there.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.202
Need to head on back to Earth.

06:49.785 --> 06:51.037
Hm. Travel papers?

06:51.120 --> 06:54.540
Yeah. You know, the, uh... Judge said
to use the same ones.

06:55.416 --> 06:57.835
Cos I'm, um, you know,
visiting the same people.

06:58.002 --> 07:01.339
Yeah, oh yeah... I almost forgot.
Brought you a nice hot cup of anti-matter.

07:02.298 --> 07:04.467
I usually only drink decaf anti-matter.

07:04.800 --> 07:06.219
- Ah.
- Eh, I'll take it.

07:06.594 --> 07:07.553
It's only 4:30.

07:07.637 --> 07:09.889
- My shift doesn't end till nine billion.
- Oof!

07:12.016 --> 07:12.975
What do I owe ya?

07:13.059 --> 07:14.352
The real question, Eleanor...

07:15.561 --> 07:17.021
is "what do we owe to each other?"

07:17.730 --> 07:20.024
<i>What do we owe to each other?</i>

07:20.608 --> 07:23.277
<i>That is the question Tim Scanlon
asked decades ago</i>

07:24.028 --> 07:28.282
<i>and it is the question I will try to answer
over the next three hours.</i>

07:28.449 --> 07:29.992
Are you Chidi Anna...

07:30.243 --> 07:31.160
Kendrick?

07:31.285 --> 07:32.954
Anagonye. And yes.

07:33.037 --> 07:35.456
Great. Hi. My name is Eleanor Shellstrop.

07:37.041 --> 07:38.000
Can we talk?

07:38.918 --> 07:39.794
Sure.

07:39.919 --> 07:41.837
OK. Uh, where do I start?

07:42.255 --> 07:45.758
I'm not, like,
the best person in the world.

07:45.925 --> 07:47.760
I'm a trash bag from Arizona

07:48.177 --> 07:49.303
which is saying something.

07:49.387 --> 07:52.014
Our biggest exports are racist sheriffs
and HPV.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.600
But about a year ago,
something crazy happened

07:54.684 --> 07:56.018
and I...

07:56.143 --> 07:58.104
<i>- T'es prêt,</i> Chidi?
<i>- Allez-y sans moi.</i>

07:58.229 --> 07:59.605
<i>- Je serai là.
- D'accord.</i>

07:59.689 --> 08:00.606
<i>A tout à l'heure.</i>

08:02.233 --> 08:04.402
Sorry, I've been flying for like 40 hours.

08:04.485 --> 08:06.320
This is Australia, right?

08:06.487 --> 08:09.824
Yes, I grew up in Senegal,
so my native language is French

08:09.991 --> 08:12.827
but I went to American schools,
so I also speak English.

08:12.910 --> 08:14.704
- Oh--
- And German, and Greek

08:14.787 --> 08:17.039
and Latin, just in case it ever comes back.

08:17.832 --> 08:21.335
Cool. I once got 12 out of 12
on a BuzzFeed quiz called

08:21.419 --> 08:23.879
"Do You Know All the Slang Words
the Kardashians Invented?"

08:24.088 --> 08:25.840
- Congratulations?
- Thank you.

08:26.340 --> 08:27.883
I'm gonna be honest, I did cheat.

08:27.925 --> 08:29.594
But you were saying something crazy
happened to you?

08:29.677 --> 08:32.805
Yes! Uh, I almost died.

08:32.930 --> 08:35.266
And it made me want to become
a better person

08:35.308 --> 08:36.976
Which I did, for a while

08:37.059 --> 08:39.895
but then I fell back into my old
trash bag ways...

08:40.187 --> 08:43.524
but yesterday I saw your lecture,
and something just clicked.

08:43.691 --> 08:47.945
Wait, you flew all the way here
from Arizona, just to see me?

08:48.070 --> 08:50.072
You know what, don't flatter yourself, pal!

08:50.406 --> 08:53.576
Sorry, that's a knee jerk reaction.
Yes, that's exactly what I did.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.912
And I know that seems "zonkatronic"

08:56.996 --> 08:58.289
that's Khloe's word for "crazy"

08:58.581 --> 09:03.544
but I need someone to help guide me,
morally speaking

09:03.586 --> 09:07.006
and... I think I need it to be you.

09:07.256 --> 09:08.341
What do you say?

09:08.507 --> 09:11.218
Will you help me become a good person?

09:14.972 --> 09:15.848
Yes.

09:23.689 --> 09:27.068
I'll start you off with some introductory
philosophy books

09:27.151 --> 09:29.528
- and then we'll meet here once a week?
- Great!

09:30.529 --> 09:32.323
- Can I ask you something?
- Mm-hm.

09:33.240 --> 09:34.617
Why are you helping me?

09:35.951 --> 09:37.662
I'm a teacher. That's my job.

09:37.870 --> 09:39.205
Yeah, but I'm not your student.

09:39.288 --> 09:42.166
I'm just some hot rando
who walked in off the street.

09:42.667 --> 09:44.043
There's gotta be another reason.

09:45.461 --> 09:47.421
Yes, there is. Um...

09:48.297 --> 09:50.257
I also had a near-death experience.

09:50.383 --> 09:51.926
- Whoa.
- But, I mean, I don't know for sure

09:51.967 --> 09:54.428
that I would've died,
but it was pretty nuts...

09:54.845 --> 09:57.181
I-I'm sorry, but this is an
important moment in our friendship--

09:57.223 --> 09:58.432
On your right, mate!

09:58.516 --> 09:59.600
Geez, watch it, man!

10:02.019 --> 10:03.896
Oh, my God! Are you OK?

10:04.480 --> 10:06.524
That... that is right where I was standing!

10:06.816 --> 10:09.443
I was frozen here,
unable to make a simple decision

10:10.069 --> 10:12.363
and I almost got crushed
by an air conditioner.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.739
This is a sign.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.325
I shouldn't be using air conditioners!

10:16.367 --> 10:18.160
The Freon is awful for the environment!

10:18.619 --> 10:20.788
That's the lesson you take from this?

10:21.872 --> 10:22.790
Chidi...

10:22.957 --> 10:25.710
Your brain is broken.
You need to fix your brain.

10:28.546 --> 10:32.925
So, in a nutshell, I have a 3,600 page
thesis that I am nowhere near finishing.

10:32.967 --> 10:37.805
I am absolutely paralysed by decision-making,
and it is destroying my life.

10:38.264 --> 10:41.475
Yeah, I sorta got that
when you couldn't choose a chair to sit on.

10:41.600 --> 10:44.478
Well, I-I didn't want to offend you
in case you had a favourite.

10:44.937 --> 10:47.273
Look, I know I just kind of...

10:47.314 --> 10:48.482
Nope... walked in here

10:48.524 --> 10:51.318
and you don't know me at all,
but is there any way to tell

10:51.360 --> 10:54.947
if my indecision is due to, uh...
a... brain... thing?

10:55.114 --> 10:56.365
Oh, yeah. Sure.

10:56.907 --> 10:59.368
Well, what we do is,
we make a lengthy incision

10:59.410 --> 11:01.620
from your eyebrows to the nape of your neck

11:01.662 --> 11:03.664
and we peel your face back, right?

11:03.706 --> 11:05.207
Then slice your skull open.

11:05.416 --> 11:09.128
And then I just randomly stab at your brain
with an electrified needle.

11:09.336 --> 11:12.089
The fun part is,
you're awake the whole time.

11:13.591 --> 11:15.050
Uh...

11:15.092 --> 11:16.510
I'm kidding! No.

11:16.969 --> 11:19.054
I'll just give you an MRI
and look at the part of your brain

11:19.096 --> 11:20.139
that controls decision-making.

11:20.639 --> 11:22.183
Oh, I... I want that!

11:22.475 --> 11:24.477
I need to learn about my brain. Please.

11:25.144 --> 11:28.439
Well, so, you just march into my office
unannounced

11:28.606 --> 11:31.358
tell me your brain is broken,
then demand I drop everything

11:31.400 --> 11:34.904
and just put you in the university's
$3 million MRI machine?

11:35.404 --> 11:36.822
Oh, I'm sorry, I...

11:36.864 --> 11:39.033
I freakin' love it!

11:39.158 --> 11:41.076
You're so weird! Let's go!

11:41.827 --> 11:43.329
- Right now?
- Oh, yeah! Come on.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.246
O-OK.

11:46.415 --> 11:47.917
This is your hippocampus.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.211
It regulates memory. Yours looks great!

11:50.294 --> 11:52.379
Very strong, gorgeous hippocampus here.

11:53.964 --> 11:58.302
This is your ventromedial prefrontal cortex,
the centre of decision-making.

11:58.511 --> 12:01.889
This is where the magic happens!
Do you see how it's all lit up?

12:02.306 --> 12:05.142
That's a flurry of activity that occurred
when I asked you to choose between

12:05.184 --> 12:06.769
red and blue, and you almost passed out.

12:07.061 --> 12:08.813
Is it too late to pick blue instead?

12:09.230 --> 12:10.773
It is. Yeah.

12:11.232 --> 12:14.235
Point is, at first glance,
your brain is very healthy.

12:14.777 --> 12:17.029
Huh, there are... actual answers here.

12:17.279 --> 12:19.448
Data you can observe, and learn from.

12:19.532 --> 12:22.326
Yeah, man!
Science is all about getting answers.

12:22.535 --> 12:26.413
You philosophers can spend your entire life
mulling over a single question.

12:26.997 --> 12:29.124
That's why everyone hates
moral philosophy professors.

12:29.250 --> 12:30.459
No offence.

12:30.543 --> 12:32.127
- Nope. None taken. We suck!
- Yeah.

12:39.510 --> 12:40.386
Chidi!

12:40.845 --> 12:42.263
One blueberry muffin, please.

12:42.763 --> 12:46.267
<i>So, why do it then?
Why choose to be good, every day?</i>

12:46.767 --> 12:50.521
<i>I argue that we choose to be good
because of our bonds with other people.</i>

12:50.729 --> 12:54.191
<i>Simply put... we are not in this alone.</i>

12:55.067 --> 12:56.944
<i>Thank you.</i>

12:57.570 --> 12:59.071
Wow, Chidi!

12:59.655 --> 13:01.907
You chose that muffin
in less than a minute.

13:02.283 --> 13:03.868
That beats your old record by...

13:04.243 --> 13:05.286
59 minutes.

13:05.369 --> 13:07.746
Henry, I feel amazing.

13:07.830 --> 13:11.125
I am 100 pages into my new thesis
and it is some of the best writing

13:11.208 --> 13:14.044
that I have ever done.
I haven't been this happy since...

13:15.546 --> 13:16.463
Oh, wow.

13:16.922 --> 13:18.841
I've never been happy. Huh!

13:19.717 --> 13:20.676
Bad!

13:20.843 --> 13:23.470
I'm proud of you, mate.
Must be really nice to live that way.

13:23.554 --> 13:26.056
Well, that's the beauty of it -
anyone can live this way.

13:26.140 --> 13:28.684
Just decide to be more decisive.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.686
Like, what's something that you've always
wanted to do?

13:30.769 --> 13:33.272
I mean, I have been putting off
getting in shape.

13:33.355 --> 13:37.151
Then make the decision to wake up
tomorrow morning, and get in shape.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.569
It is that easy.

13:38.652 --> 13:41.822
- OK! Maybe I will!
- I mean, what have you got to lose?

13:41.906 --> 13:43.032
Nothing!

13:45.034 --> 13:46.327
Henry! What happened to you?

13:46.410 --> 13:48.746
Well, I was using the leg press at the gym

13:48.996 --> 13:51.790
and you know how your legs
bend a certain way?

13:52.291 --> 13:54.001
My legs bend the other way now.

13:54.084 --> 13:54.960
Oh, no.

13:55.210 --> 13:57.838
All the tendons in my legs
snapped like violin strings.

13:58.339 --> 14:01.216
And then my foot flew forwards
and I kicked myself in the face

14:01.258 --> 14:02.384
which gave me a concussion.

14:02.468 --> 14:04.053
This is all my fault.

14:04.345 --> 14:05.888
I did this to you. I...

14:06.305 --> 14:08.933
Muffins! I brought blueberry muffins!

14:09.183 --> 14:11.226
Oh, no, you shouldn't eat blueberries
anymore.

14:11.352 --> 14:14.939
Read an article, the migrant workers
who pick them are horribly mistreated.

14:16.106 --> 14:18.817
Gaaaaaah!

14:21.320 --> 14:23.113
Morning, Chidi! Blueberry muffin for ya?

14:23.197 --> 14:24.615
Uh... I... I don't know. Maybe?

14:24.657 --> 14:26.533
- I can't decide.
- You alright there, mate?

14:26.784 --> 14:28.202
OK, I've made my decision.

14:28.827 --> 14:30.245
I want to...

14:30.621 --> 14:32.623
start crying!

14:36.919 --> 14:37.878
Excuse me?

14:38.379 --> 14:41.256
What is the maximum number of books
that I can check out? Is it 12,000?

14:41.423 --> 14:42.967
Got a wild weekend planned?

14:43.050 --> 14:45.052
Well, I need to find a new topic
for my thesis

14:45.135 --> 14:47.721
and I had this thing happen
that made me more decisive

14:47.763 --> 14:49.515
and a few months ago,
my friend broke both of his legs

14:49.556 --> 14:51.350
and it's my fault, and blueberries,
and I need help!

14:51.558 --> 14:52.434
Whoo!

14:52.518 --> 14:55.896
Maybe that help will come from
Tay Zonday's autobiography

14:55.980 --> 14:58.273
"Chocolate Book"! I mean, who's to say?

14:58.357 --> 15:01.402
Mate, I've worked in
this library a long time

15:01.443 --> 15:06.824
and I've seen a lot of academic types
with that same helpless look on their faces.

15:07.199 --> 15:09.201
They all made it through OK

15:10.035 --> 15:11.662
once they learned the secret.

15:12.162 --> 15:14.123
What's the secret? There's a secret?
Is the secret more books?

15:14.164 --> 15:16.417
- How many more books do I need?
- It's not about books, mate.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.335
It's about perspective.

15:18.836 --> 15:22.631
Sometimes, when you're feeling helpless,
the secret is to help someone else.

15:22.798 --> 15:24.508
Get out of your own head. Trust me.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.885
The next time someone asks for help

15:27.720 --> 15:28.846
say "yes."

15:31.598 --> 15:34.685
A few hours later,
you walked in and asked for help.

15:35.060 --> 15:37.938
Now, I don't know if this is going to solve
all of my problems

15:37.980 --> 15:40.607
but it's worth a try, right?

15:40.816 --> 15:43.444
Well, thank you, sexy librarian guy!

15:43.569 --> 15:45.529
I didn't say he was sexy.

15:45.821 --> 15:48.449
Oh, I know, but whenever anyone
tells me a story about their life

15:48.490 --> 15:50.784
I always imagine all the people
as being super hot

15:50.826 --> 15:52.161
otherwise I quickly lose interest.

15:52.828 --> 15:53.954
Do you not do that?

15:54.038 --> 15:55.414
You can do it for free.

15:58.375 --> 16:02.212
I gotta say, I enjoyed playing the role
of "mysterious librarian".

16:02.337 --> 16:03.213
And I really...

16:03.255 --> 16:05.591
...nailed the Australian accent.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.301
Uh-huh. Flawless.

16:07.384 --> 16:08.260
Thank you.

16:08.343 --> 16:12.514
But the point is, Eleanor and Chidi
are together and now we can relax.

16:12.598 --> 16:14.808
Everything is finally on track.

16:20.939 --> 16:22.107
Status report.

16:22.191 --> 16:25.069
They're plugging away, but we still can't
hack into the Judge's system.

16:25.235 --> 16:26.195
Damn it!

16:26.361 --> 16:29.073
Those four humans have been on Earth
for over a year.

16:29.239 --> 16:31.533
I need to know if they're getting better.

16:31.658 --> 16:32.785
Can I just ask...

16:33.202 --> 16:35.329
we torture like 30 billion humans.

16:35.412 --> 16:37.372
Why do you care so much about these four?

16:40.542 --> 16:41.418
Never mind.

16:41.835 --> 16:42.711
Forget I asked.

16:44.421 --> 16:46.465
Serves him right for questioning you, boss!

16:46.548 --> 16:48.967
- I think you're doing a great job.
- Thank you, Todd.

16:49.593 --> 16:50.552
No-no-no--!

16:50.636 --> 16:51.678
Why did you do that?

16:51.887 --> 16:53.972
I'm a demon. It's fun.

16:54.556 --> 16:57.768
No one leaves this room until
we've accessed the Judge's system.

16:57.935 --> 17:00.562
Would music help? Should I play some music?

17:01.188 --> 17:02.064
Good idea.

17:02.189 --> 17:04.817
Choose something deeply terrible,
to inspire us.

17:09.571 --> 17:11.615
<i>- ♪ Wherever you go ♪</i>
- Oh, yeah.

17:11.698 --> 17:13.534
<i>- ♪ Whatever you do ♪</i>
- That's the stuff.

17:14.201 --> 17:17.830
So, for Aristotle, virtue is practical.

17:17.996 --> 17:20.457
"Goodness" isn't something that a person
just inherently has

17:20.541 --> 17:23.752
it's something that she achieves
through her actions.

17:24.086 --> 17:26.296
- Questions?
- Uh, yeah, a few.

17:26.672 --> 17:29.133
I wrote down, "What?", "Huh?"

17:29.258 --> 17:33.053
and then this doodle of a burrito,
because when I first read "Aristotle"

17:33.095 --> 17:35.139
I thought it was
pronounced like "Chipotle."

17:35.597 --> 17:37.724
Wait a minute, is it "Chippa-tottle?"

17:38.308 --> 17:43.605
These are all great questions, but I have to
meet my thesis advisor across campus.

17:43.689 --> 17:46.066
Oh. Uh, well, I'm headed that way too.
I'll walk with you.

17:46.400 --> 17:47.442
Hey, so...

17:48.318 --> 17:51.572
I've been trying to figure out
how to pay you back for helping me.

17:51.780 --> 17:53.824
I told you, you don't owe me anything.

17:53.949 --> 17:56.827
At home, when I want to get something nice
for one of my friends

17:56.910 --> 17:59.705
it usually comes in the
form of something...

18:00.247 --> 18:01.123
edible.

18:01.290 --> 18:03.333
You get what I'm saying? An edible thing?

18:03.458 --> 18:05.544
- Please don't buy me drugs.
- OK. Copy that.

18:06.211 --> 18:09.173
I had no choice. I was in his driveway
taking pictures when he walked out.

18:09.256 --> 18:12.009
So I said, "Hey, Mister Crowe,
I'm from the gas company.

18:12.092 --> 18:13.302
I loved you in <i>Gladiator.</i>

18:13.427 --> 18:14.344
Chidi!

18:14.386 --> 18:15.262
- Hey!
- Hey.

18:15.304 --> 18:17.472
- I got a question...
- Is it "What's my thesis topic?"

18:17.514 --> 18:20.225
- Because I still don't know!
- No, it's not that.

18:21.810 --> 18:23.478
Oh, I'm sorry, you guys haven't met yet.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.022
Um, Simone, this is Eleanor.

18:25.189 --> 18:27.065
The famous Simone! Nice to meet you.

18:27.232 --> 18:28.192
You too.

18:28.483 --> 18:31.445
So, I've gotta do some MRI scans
as a control for an experiment

18:31.528 --> 18:34.656
and since you loved it so much last time,
I was wondering if you could just

18:34.740 --> 18:36.575
- pop back in there, help me out?
- Oh, absolutely.

18:36.783 --> 18:39.036
Cool. OK, well, just come by my lab at six

18:39.119 --> 18:40.913
and then afterwards I can buy you dinner
as a thank you.

18:41.038 --> 18:42.956
Oh, no, no, you don't have to do that.

18:43.248 --> 18:44.374
Oh. OK!

18:44.875 --> 18:47.002
Well, uh... I'll see ya later.
Nice to meet you.

18:47.085 --> 18:47.961
You too.

18:51.423 --> 18:52.591
- What?
- Uh...

18:52.716 --> 18:55.969
you and Simone had some real professor dork
vibes flowing.

18:56.345 --> 18:58.889
You're both teachers...
who are hot for a teacher!

18:59.056 --> 19:01.767
How have you not asked her out yet?

19:01.892 --> 19:02.809
Are you scared?

19:02.851 --> 19:05.520
No, it's not impressive to guess
that I'm scared, Eleanor.

19:05.562 --> 19:09.650
I'm scared of everything.
And I can't just... do things like that.

19:09.983 --> 19:11.151
- Just drop it, OK?
- Well--

19:11.193 --> 19:13.195
OK, just promise me you'll drop it?

19:14.738 --> 19:15.614
OK.

19:15.948 --> 19:16.907
I promise.

19:17.658 --> 19:19.576
So, you're into Chidi, right?

19:19.952 --> 19:23.080
I mean, forgive my bluntness,
but I'm usually right about these things.

19:23.538 --> 19:26.375
Well, yeah, but I've made it pretty clear
a bunch of times

19:26.416 --> 19:29.461
and he's never responded,
so I just assumed he wasn't interested.

19:29.586 --> 19:30.879
<i>OK, I'm all set.</i>

19:31.129 --> 19:33.799
I'm just gonna ask you some
basic questions, Chidi, uh...

19:33.882 --> 19:35.467
<i>what is one plus one?</i>

19:35.592 --> 19:37.219
- Two.
<i>- What colour is the sky?</i>

19:37.719 --> 19:40.138
- Blue.
<i>- What colour are Simone's eyes?</i>

19:40.305 --> 19:42.391
Brown. Wh... I... uh, what?

19:43.850 --> 19:46.228
If you could take Simone anywhere,
on a date

19:46.395 --> 19:47.646
where would you take her?

19:47.896 --> 19:49.690
Sorry, is this part of the experiment?

19:49.773 --> 19:50.899
<i>It is now. Yes.</i>

19:50.983 --> 19:51.984
<i>Please answer the question.</i>

19:52.025 --> 19:54.236
<i>And keep in mind we can see your brain.</i>

19:54.569 --> 19:56.780
Next question, you are into Simone.

19:56.905 --> 19:57.906
That's not a question.

19:58.073 --> 19:59.825
So you agree, it's a fact.

19:59.950 --> 20:01.243
Next question's for Simone.

20:01.326 --> 20:04.705
Simone, are you annoyed at Chidi
for waiting so long to ask you out?

20:04.788 --> 20:05.664
Yes, I am.

20:05.747 --> 20:08.625
Chidi, same question for you,
are you annoyed at yourself

20:08.709 --> 20:10.460
for waiting so long to ask out Simone?

20:10.544 --> 20:13.338
I mean, I'm annoyed with you
and I've only known you three weeks.

20:13.505 --> 20:16.591
Yes, I am obviously very
annoyed with myself.

20:16.675 --> 20:19.136
- Can I get out now?
- No, you can't, it'll ruin the science.

20:19.261 --> 20:22.931
<i>There's only one question left,
and you gotta ask it, bud.</i>

20:25.851 --> 20:28.603
Simone, would you like to have dinner
with me?

20:29.313 --> 20:31.148
Wow. That is highly inappropriate.

20:31.231 --> 20:32.441
Uh...

20:32.482 --> 20:35.068
I'm just kidding. Yes, I would.
Thank you for asking.

20:36.111 --> 20:37.571
Oh, cute!

20:37.654 --> 20:38.780
This is a disaster!

20:38.864 --> 20:40.073
Michael, relax.

20:40.240 --> 20:41.825
How the two of them gonna bond?

20:41.908 --> 20:44.828
There were plenty of reboots where
Eleanor and Chidi weren't even soulmates

20:44.911 --> 20:46.621
and he still always helped her.

20:46.955 --> 20:49.082
Simone and Chidi are good together!

20:49.458 --> 20:52.085
I've been running simulations
on what their kids will be like.

20:52.210 --> 20:54.755
One of them is hot enough
to be on <i>The Bachelor</i>

20:54.963 --> 20:57.591
and smart enough to never go
on <i>The Bachelor!</i>

20:58.008 --> 20:59.551
This is not just about Chidi.

20:59.885 --> 21:01.511
I've left too much to chance.

21:02.095 --> 21:05.807
Until our group is back together again,
this whole thing is hanging by a thread.

21:06.224 --> 21:07.267
I'm going back down.

21:07.893 --> 21:09.061
You're pressing your luck.

21:09.144 --> 21:11.938
If you keep disobeying Mummy,
something bad is going to happen!

21:12.230 --> 21:13.774
- What?
- Oh, I don't have a mum

21:13.815 --> 21:17.569
so I've been experimenting with thinking of
the Judge as my mum.

21:17.986 --> 21:18.862
It's weird.

21:18.904 --> 21:19.780
- Forget it.
- OK.

21:19.821 --> 21:22.240
How are you even gonna get Jason and Tahani
to Australia?

21:22.574 --> 21:24.659
I have no idea. But I have to try.

21:24.993 --> 21:25.869
Well...

21:25.952 --> 21:26.828
Good luck, Dad.

21:26.870 --> 21:28.455
Nope! Also weird. Just go.
