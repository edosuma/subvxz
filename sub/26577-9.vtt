WEBVTT

00:04.540 --> 00:06.420
Hey, D.J. What are you doing here?

00:06.689 --> 00:08.630
Geena sent me over 'cause
she doesn't want her

00:08.640 --> 00:09.840
or Mary to get sick.

00:09.860 --> 00:12.600
I guess she figured whatever
germs are living in this couch

00:12.620 --> 00:14.920
would kill the intruders.

00:15.020 --> 00:16.420
You're in luck, Deej.

00:16.440 --> 00:19.140
The unlabeled can that was in
the pantry since we were kids?

00:19.180 --> 00:20.260
Chicken soup.

00:22.360 --> 00:23.540
Tastes okay.

00:23.620 --> 00:26.260
Yeah, I figured. The can
was barely swollen.

00:27.680 --> 00:29.200
- Hey.
- Hey.

00:29.220 --> 00:30.480
Oh, don't go near D.J.

00:30.500 --> 00:32.619
He's sick, and I've used up
all my nurturing on him,

00:32.650 --> 00:35.060
so if you guys get sick, I'm
just gonna yell at you.

00:35.120 --> 00:38.050
Sorry, Uncle D.J. I
can't get sick, anyway.

00:38.080 --> 00:39.520
I have a test tomorrow.

00:39.530 --> 00:40.780
I do, too,

00:40.800 --> 00:43.390
so if you want to cough
on my scarf, please do.

00:44.700 --> 00:45.900
Thank you.

00:46.900 --> 00:50.060
So... where's Dan?

00:50.070 --> 00:51.640
Mom wants some shelves put in

00:51.650 --> 00:53.600
above her bed for her bowling trophies.

00:53.610 --> 00:54.800
Why can't you do it?

00:54.860 --> 00:57.900
'Cause if it falls, I'm the
one with the obvious motive.

00:59.700 --> 01:02.119
Dad's covering my
vending-machine route today.

01:02.120 --> 01:04.230
I hope he can handle it.
It's a very complicated job.

01:05.319 --> 01:07.720
Isn't it just like you
open a glass door,

01:07.740 --> 01:09.570
and you replace the chips and the candy?

01:10.720 --> 01:13.890
Yeah, and space travel is
just lighting a rocket

01:13.900 --> 01:14.930
and landing on the moon.

01:16.260 --> 01:18.170
Did you just equate space travel

01:18.180 --> 01:19.860
with servicing a vending machine?

01:23.720 --> 01:25.730
Oh, Dan. My God.

01:25.740 --> 01:26.780
What happened?

01:26.800 --> 01:28.800
A vending machine fell over on me.

01:30.060 --> 01:31.780
I knew it. Are you okay?

01:32.360 --> 01:35.500
Again, a vending machine fell on me.

01:35.570 --> 01:37.280
How? They're bolted to the wall.

01:37.340 --> 01:39.140
This one wasn't.

01:39.180 --> 01:40.750
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I'm sure!

01:40.780 --> 01:42.220
I had plenty of time
to stare at the wall

01:42.240 --> 01:43.580
while it was crushing me.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.580
Well, how bad is it?

01:46.600 --> 01:49.560
I had to spend four
hours in the emergency.

01:49.700 --> 01:51.320
Nobody has insurance now,

01:51.340 --> 01:53.660
so they use it like a doctor's office.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.240
It's a no-win situation

01:55.260 --> 01:57.020
because the emergency has to take you,

01:57.030 --> 01:58.240
but it costs a fortune.

01:58.280 --> 02:02.000
Oh, I don't know. It was only $6,000.

02:02.040 --> 02:05.310
If I'd have had my other pants
on, I'd have paid it right then.

02:05.480 --> 02:07.540
$6,000?

02:07.580 --> 02:09.940
I thought Medicare covered like 80%.

02:10.000 --> 02:12.390
They did, but they made me take an MRI,

02:12.400 --> 02:14.780
a blood test, an I.V.,

02:14.800 --> 02:17.770
a bone guy, a brain guy.

02:17.780 --> 02:19.780
That's the co-pay.

02:19.880 --> 02:23.000
We can't afford this, and
it's the company's fault.

02:23.020 --> 02:25.560
You know what? They better pay
or we're gonna have to sue.

02:25.570 --> 02:27.680
Wait. Uh, you can't sue
the company I work for.

02:27.700 --> 02:30.420
Eat your old soup and be quiet.

02:30.490 --> 02:33.000
Relax, Deej. I'm not suing anybody.

02:33.060 --> 02:35.350
I'm sure the company
will cover my expenses.

02:35.360 --> 02:37.520
Oh, don't be naive, Dan.

02:37.540 --> 02:39.160
Those vending-machine companies...

02:39.180 --> 02:41.020
they'll nickle and dime ya.

02:41.050 --> 02:42.660
Hey, hey!

02:45.300 --> 02:47.530
I didn't even mean to do that.

"The Conners" is recorded

03:27.060 --> 03:28.959
in front of a live studio audience.

03:28.960 --> 03:30.740
Hey, check out my updated website.

03:30.760 --> 03:33.960
I'm using icons to subliminally suggest

03:33.980 --> 03:35.440
that people use my services.

03:35.520 --> 03:37.680
So, you see, the drum
majorette and the sun?

03:37.820 --> 03:39.980
That implies I can lead you to a life

03:39.990 --> 03:43.060
where nobody rains on your parade!

03:44.400 --> 03:46.420
Yeah, yeah. That's a huge stretch.

03:47.780 --> 03:49.220
You want to hear about my day?

03:49.250 --> 03:51.200
I don't care. I do.

03:52.160 --> 03:53.720
The owner told me I have to stop

03:53.750 --> 03:55.390
flirting with the other employees.

03:55.400 --> 03:57.820
Well, to be fair, you did
have sex with two of them.

03:59.600 --> 04:01.420
Yeah, he lead with that.

04:02.220 --> 04:03.660
Did he single you out?

04:03.720 --> 04:06.800
No. He told everyone there's
gonna be zero tolerance

04:06.820 --> 04:09.000
for fraternizing amongst the employees,

04:09.020 --> 04:11.779
and he's making us all take
boundary-awareness training.

04:11.780 --> 04:14.770
Well, that's not the
worst thing for you.

04:14.840 --> 04:16.680
It's stupid.

04:16.720 --> 04:18.779
Work is where most people meet.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.500
And meeting people at work is perfect

04:20.519 --> 04:22.150
because you know they have jobs.

04:23.240 --> 04:26.720
Um, let me talk to you
not as your Aunt Jackie,

04:26.740 --> 04:29.520
but as Lanford's leading
certified life coach.

04:29.940 --> 04:33.600
Um, maybe you're flirting
too much in general.

04:33.620 --> 04:35.690
For instance, the guy at the Rite Aid.

04:35.700 --> 04:36.930
Paul?

04:36.940 --> 04:39.270
It's just a little game we play.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.040
He asked you to marry him,

04:41.060 --> 04:43.580
and you haven't said no yet.

04:44.220 --> 04:46.500
That's the game.

04:46.540 --> 04:48.520
Okay, well, at least let me help you

04:48.540 --> 04:50.300
get your boundary-awareness certificate.

04:50.330 --> 04:52.850
I'm fully accredited. See?

04:52.860 --> 04:55.240
A wise, old owl is saying it.

04:58.580 --> 05:00.310
I'm sorry to hear you hurt
yourself, Mr. Conner.

05:00.320 --> 05:01.940
- Please call me Dan.
- Okay, Dan.

05:01.960 --> 05:04.860
Um, before we start, how about a snack?

05:04.880 --> 05:06.770
Huh? "Snack time's all the time."

05:06.780 --> 05:07.900
That's our slogan.

05:09.220 --> 05:11.320
Oh. I thought it'd be
something more like,

05:11.340 --> 05:13.000
"We crush you with our
vending machines."

05:14.800 --> 05:17.740
Anyway, we have cheese
puffs, mini pretzels,

05:17.760 --> 05:19.480
and we have cheese and crackers.

05:19.500 --> 05:20.970
You know that little,
red, plastic paddle

05:20.980 --> 05:22.980
in the cheese-and-cracker packet?

05:22.990 --> 05:24.700
That was us.

05:24.740 --> 05:27.460
I don't want to take
up a lot of your time.

05:27.580 --> 05:29.940
I'm just asking to get
my medical bills covered

05:29.980 --> 05:33.180
because your machine should
have been bolted to that wall,

05:33.220 --> 05:36.580
and I'll take some
cheese puffs for later.

05:36.640 --> 05:37.720
Well, it's not that simple.

05:37.740 --> 05:40.190
See, first of all, you're not
an authorized technician.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.620
This, uh, never would have happened

05:41.640 --> 05:42.980
had you been trained for the job.

05:43.080 --> 05:44.200
It fell on him.

05:44.220 --> 05:45.800
Are you saying if my dad was trained

05:45.820 --> 05:49.020
that gravity would have
behaved differently?

05:49.050 --> 05:50.600
My company has a heart,

05:50.620 --> 05:52.680
and I have been authorized to...

05:52.700 --> 05:54.230
offer to pay half your medical bills.

05:54.240 --> 05:56.100
Half? Are you kidding me?

05:56.140 --> 05:58.340
Relax, Darlene. We've just
started talking about this.

05:58.360 --> 06:01.040
No, they're trying to screw us.
I knew they would do this.

06:01.060 --> 06:03.730
I guess we're just gonna have
to get ourselves a lawyer.

06:03.740 --> 06:05.180
How do you like our new business, Dad?

06:05.200 --> 06:07.481
Of course, we're gonna have to
get rid of Old Man Grayson.

06:08.490 --> 06:10.200
Okay, we're done.

06:10.490 --> 06:13.080
Once you say "lawyer," I'm no
longer allowed to talk to you.

06:13.150 --> 06:15.040
Oh, I'd like to take this opportunity

06:15.060 --> 06:16.440
to dismiss my counsel.

06:16.470 --> 06:18.500
I'll be representing myself.

06:19.120 --> 06:20.600
You're selling out your daughter?

06:20.640 --> 06:21.990
And how.

06:24.260 --> 06:26.140
Oh, I like that.

06:26.150 --> 06:28.240
But, no, we can't keep talking.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.160
They'll validate your
parking at the front desk.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.320
Fine, but just so you know,

06:32.340 --> 06:34.020
your red, plastic paddle is dumb.

06:34.030 --> 06:36.300
You've got to make the cheese
softer or the paddle harder.

06:36.320 --> 06:37.350
Jerk.

06:43.440 --> 06:46.720
I can't believe those phones are
more interesting than I am.

06:48.680 --> 06:51.320
Sorry about that. We were being rude.

06:51.340 --> 06:53.480
Don't take this the wrong
way, but you're way too hot

06:53.500 --> 06:55.800
to be working in a place like this.

06:56.200 --> 06:59.420
You're gonna let him leave
you in the dust like that?

06:59.740 --> 07:01.079
I figured you knew you were hot,

07:01.080 --> 07:02.620
so I didn't have to say anything.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.760
Good job.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.740
I'll get your waitress for
you. This isn't my section.

07:11.660 --> 07:14.180
Hey, hey. Can I talk
to you for a second?

07:14.200 --> 07:15.959
- Sure.
- Have you seen this?

07:15.960 --> 07:18.880
That's your picture on
my rival's website,

07:18.900 --> 07:20.120
Rita Silver.

07:20.140 --> 07:22.560
How could you go to her
for your certificate?

07:22.580 --> 07:24.680
Look what she wrote...
"I am now coaching

07:24.700 --> 07:26.930
the niece of Jackie Harris,

07:26.940 --> 07:29.640
Lanford's number-two life coach."

07:31.780 --> 07:33.700
Look, I'm gonna be honest with you.

07:33.900 --> 07:36.340
I didn't know whether you
were a life coach or not.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.120
I've never seen you with a client.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.220
Of course I have clients!

07:40.240 --> 07:43.850
You don't see them because
I fix their lives so quick!

07:43.940 --> 07:46.350
We...

07:46.360 --> 07:48.920
And Rita Silver is a certificate mill,

07:48.940 --> 07:51.440
and if you'd come to me,
you'd have your certificate

07:51.470 --> 07:54.740
and a little bit of knowledge
about what's going on in there!

07:55.820 --> 07:58.300
Sorry, but I think this
whole thing is bogus,

07:58.330 --> 08:01.100
so why not just go to somebody
who's gonna rubber-stamp it?

08:01.110 --> 08:02.860
I have enough to deal with right now.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.320
All right. I'll let it go.

08:04.340 --> 08:07.540
But after what Rita said,

08:07.570 --> 08:10.150
I might have to put a little
something on my website

08:10.160 --> 08:11.940
that destroys your reputation.

08:16.950 --> 08:19.440
Okay. We just did 10 minutes
of physical activity.

08:19.470 --> 08:20.956
Can we have our game controllers back?

08:20.980 --> 08:22.860
Uh, I said 30 minutes.

08:22.960 --> 08:26.940
It's 10 below zero. The
ball almost shattered.

08:27.480 --> 08:30.140
Back in my day, we
called that shatterball,

08:30.150 --> 08:31.700
and we loved it.

08:33.760 --> 08:35.360
That was the ambulance company.

08:35.940 --> 08:39.220
I just went two blocks for $800.

08:39.280 --> 08:42.039
You want to meet with them and
get it up to an even thousand?

08:42.480 --> 08:44.760
I-I told you I'd handle the bills.

08:44.820 --> 08:47.220
Like you handled the guy at
the vending-machine company?

08:47.240 --> 08:48.580
We were negotiating.

08:48.600 --> 08:50.020
We need somebody to fight for us,

08:50.030 --> 08:51.340
which is why I called a lawyer,

08:51.370 --> 08:53.930
and he should be here any
minute, and you're welcome.

08:53.940 --> 08:56.360
I don't want a lawyer!

08:57.660 --> 08:59.640
I'll go back and talk to the guy alone.

08:59.650 --> 09:01.540
Oh, and do what?

09:01.580 --> 09:04.739
Get five bucks more and a
packet of mini pretzels?

09:04.740 --> 09:06.219
Just hear this guy out.

09:06.220 --> 09:08.219
He's obviously very successful.

09:08.220 --> 09:11.220
I saw his commercial on a
screen at the gas pump.

09:11.320 --> 09:14.960
Oh, well, if the gas
station recommends him...

09:16.280 --> 09:18.580
Why are you pushing this so hard?

09:18.780 --> 09:21.700
Because we were already up against it,

09:21.720 --> 09:23.810
and if you can't work for a
long time, it'll break us.

09:23.820 --> 09:25.460
We don't have any savings.

09:25.470 --> 09:28.100
If you're worried about me,
I can take care of myself.

09:28.120 --> 09:29.480
Well, what if you can't?

09:29.500 --> 09:32.120
I mean, there's barely any
good-paying jobs out there.

09:32.140 --> 09:34.980
My kids might be living
with us until their 20s,

09:34.990 --> 09:36.350
and if you're not working,

09:36.380 --> 09:38.300
I don't know how I'm gonna
take care of everybody.

09:38.320 --> 09:40.100
I will not be a burden.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.240
I'll sell my organs to science...

09:43.400 --> 09:45.060
... slowly.

09:46.200 --> 09:47.319
Just play nice.

09:47.320 --> 09:49.380
- Don't attack him.
- I'll try,

09:49.440 --> 09:51.920
but there's a reason there's never
been a lawyer in this house.

09:51.960 --> 09:53.980
Or a teacher or a senator

09:53.990 --> 09:55.260
or anyone with a master's degree.

09:55.280 --> 09:56.500
Let's see what happens.

09:57.420 --> 09:59.310
Darlene? Brian Foster.

09:59.320 --> 10:01.350
Oh, thank you so much for coming.

10:01.360 --> 10:02.880
This is my dad, Dan Conner.

10:02.940 --> 10:04.239
Nice to meet you, Mr. Conner.

10:04.240 --> 10:06.160
Hey. Sorry. I got a bad wing.

10:06.240 --> 10:09.190
Also I think all lawyers
should be thrown into the sea.

10:10.280 --> 10:12.340
He was very pleasant before the injury.

10:12.360 --> 10:13.780
We should be compensated for that.

10:14.760 --> 10:16.760
Look, I'm sure you must be worrying

10:16.780 --> 10:17.920
not just about the injury,

10:17.950 --> 10:19.820
but how you're gonna pay those bills.

10:19.900 --> 10:21.520
That's what I'm here for.

10:21.530 --> 10:24.840
I am really gonna fight for
you to get a fair shake.

10:24.920 --> 10:27.800
Uh, I was just telling him we
need someone to fight for us.

10:27.820 --> 10:29.190
Remember I was just telling you that?

10:29.200 --> 10:30.559
Yeah, I do.

10:30.560 --> 10:32.230
I have the uncanny ability

10:32.240 --> 10:33.890
to remember things from seconds ago.

10:35.680 --> 10:38.270
Look, I'm not looking
to win the lottery.

10:38.280 --> 10:40.230
All I want is my hospital bills paid.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.520
Dan, you've already done the hard work.

10:42.530 --> 10:43.700
You got hurt.

10:44.880 --> 10:46.279
Now let me do my job.

10:46.280 --> 10:48.280
Darlene faxed me all the info.

10:48.650 --> 10:50.060
I see six figures.

10:50.120 --> 10:53.100
Whoa! Six figures?!
I'm not hurt that bad!

10:53.120 --> 10:54.580
Never say that again.

10:56.060 --> 10:58.180
You have no idea what kind of problems

10:58.200 --> 10:59.320
you're gonna have in the future,

10:59.340 --> 11:01.780
and this is pennies to these people.

11:01.940 --> 11:04.660
And the fact is, they were negligent.

11:04.940 --> 11:06.640
You were helping out your sick kid,

11:06.660 --> 11:09.350
which I know will make
every woman on that jury

11:09.380 --> 11:11.730
want to have sex with you.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.180
I'd rather not.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.500
If they can just bring me a
beer in front of the TV,

11:16.520 --> 11:18.310
that'd be fine.

11:18.320 --> 11:21.020
They'll settle this long
before they go to trial.

11:21.030 --> 11:23.060
You deserve this money.

11:23.070 --> 11:25.420
Wouldn't it be nice to put
a few bucks in the bank

11:25.440 --> 11:26.600
for your family?

11:26.640 --> 11:28.840
Oh, he'll do it. Right? You'll do it?

11:29.490 --> 11:31.100
He'll do it.

11:31.760 --> 11:33.060
I'll do it.

11:33.100 --> 11:35.230
Now all you got to do is
get my daughter on board.

11:39.900 --> 11:42.380
Here's to Dad retiring before he dies.

11:44.400 --> 11:46.390
So, Grandpa, how much
money are you gonna get?

11:46.400 --> 11:47.850
We're not getting rich,

11:47.860 --> 11:50.560
but we ought to see a
few bucks out of this,

11:50.570 --> 11:52.600
and if we do, it'll be
good for all of us.

11:52.610 --> 11:53.810
Can you imagine?

11:53.820 --> 11:55.770
We could get the house
down to one mortgage

11:55.780 --> 11:57.310
and get a new water heater

11:57.320 --> 12:00.260
so we can shower like it's not
a pit stop at a NASCAR race.

12:01.540 --> 12:04.310
Do I dare dream about a
college with a campus

12:04.320 --> 12:06.880
instead of an office building
next to the freeway?

12:06.900 --> 12:09.270
You can certainly start
thinking about it.

12:09.280 --> 12:10.810
Thanks, Grandpa!

12:10.820 --> 12:12.080
I love you more than Mom.

12:13.120 --> 12:16.230
The Art Institute is offering
five kids from our school

12:16.240 --> 12:18.600
a chance to take classes
with Tony Fitzpatrick.

12:18.610 --> 12:19.780
He's amazing.

12:19.820 --> 12:22.270
I sent in some of my art from
class, and they picked me.

12:22.280 --> 12:24.120
Wow. I didn't know you did that.

12:24.320 --> 12:26.756
It costs a lot of money, and I
didn't think we could afford it.

12:26.780 --> 12:28.320
It's $500.

12:28.380 --> 12:30.800
- Is it important to you?
- Yeah.

12:30.820 --> 12:32.220
Let them know you're coming.

12:32.260 --> 12:33.690
I love you more than Mom, too!

12:35.620 --> 12:37.300
Darlene, what do you want?

12:37.400 --> 12:39.500
Well, the love of my
children would be nice.

12:40.840 --> 12:43.820
So, another toast to Dan
for making it all possible

12:43.840 --> 12:45.140
by doing something as stupid

12:45.150 --> 12:46.940
as pulling a vending
machine over on himself.

12:50.150 --> 12:51.890
All right. You guys can go ahead.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.350
I'm gonna make Becky bring
me dessert, eat half of it,

12:54.360 --> 12:56.020
and then send it back.

12:56.060 --> 12:57.930
Can I get a daiquiri, please?

12:57.940 --> 12:59.560
- Sure.
- Thanks, Becky.

13:00.300 --> 13:01.920
I'm sorry. Do we know each other?

13:01.940 --> 13:04.350
No, but you know my boyfriend, Gil.

13:04.360 --> 13:05.900
You've been texting him.

13:06.860 --> 13:08.020
Huh.

13:08.080 --> 13:10.310
I didn't know that Gil had a girlfriend.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.380
Also I don't know who Gil is.

13:13.240 --> 13:14.340
Really?

13:15.720 --> 13:17.600
Oh, yeah.

13:17.610 --> 13:19.730
I know that guy.

13:19.740 --> 13:21.280
He never told me he had a girlfriend.

13:21.360 --> 13:23.140
Would you have cared if he did?

13:23.150 --> 13:25.520
Hey, if he's in a relationship,

13:25.530 --> 13:27.430
that's on him.

13:27.440 --> 13:29.390
One daiquiri.

13:29.400 --> 13:30.970
But you're the one who's sending him

13:30.980 --> 13:33.930
pictures of you in a short
skirt and cowboy boots.

13:33.940 --> 13:36.190
Stop it. Look, I know
what you're doing, okay?

13:36.220 --> 13:38.060
I've met trash before.

13:40.490 --> 13:43.120
- You need to leave.
- Oh, I intend to.

13:43.990 --> 13:45.310
Oops.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.520
I guess you'll probably try
to drink that up, right?

13:47.540 --> 13:49.840
Because you seem to like
stuff I've already had.

13:51.780 --> 13:53.480
Watch your men, ladies!

13:53.500 --> 13:55.640
'Cause this little slut
will come after them!

13:57.650 --> 13:58.890
Why did you stop me?

13:58.900 --> 14:01.320
Because she wasn't totally wrong.

14:04.880 --> 14:06.319
She called me a slut!

14:06.320 --> 14:07.760
Okay, she was wrong about that,

14:07.800 --> 14:09.120
but what do you think that you would do

14:09.140 --> 14:11.640
if somebody was texting your
boyfriend like you're doing?

14:11.780 --> 14:13.760
I don't know, but I wouldn't knock over

14:13.780 --> 14:15.120
a perfectly good daiquiri.

14:16.460 --> 14:20.930
Becky, you're looking for all
of your validation in men.

14:21.000 --> 14:22.160
I know what it's like.

14:22.190 --> 14:25.600
I used to look for a lot of
my self-worth in bars...

14:25.610 --> 14:28.060
biker bars, trucker bars, cop bars,

14:28.070 --> 14:31.030
and one gay bar, which may or
may not have been an accident.

14:32.860 --> 14:35.310
But that's you, not me.

14:35.320 --> 14:36.919
I admit that I flirt too much,

14:36.920 --> 14:40.020
but you're making it into a
bigger problem than it is.

14:42.480 --> 14:44.759
- Is that a guy?
- Yeah, it's a guy.

14:44.760 --> 14:47.190
Which one is this?

14:47.200 --> 14:50.480
I don't know. He didn't
include his face.

14:50.490 --> 14:53.020
Is that the direction you
want to keep going in?

14:53.200 --> 14:55.720
- No, not really.
- Okay, well, then step one

14:55.740 --> 14:57.310
is you have to erase
everything on that phone

14:57.320 --> 14:59.560
that has anything to do
with flirting with guys.

14:59.620 --> 15:00.990
Okay.

15:07.610 --> 15:09.840
Might as well just do a factory reset.

15:14.040 --> 15:17.030
You know, this whole lawsuit
thing is really bad for D.J.

15:18.620 --> 15:21.160
Oh, well, I'm sure
he'll get another job.

15:21.180 --> 15:23.520
He's got experience handling change.

15:23.530 --> 15:25.860
The coin-operated industry's his oyster.

15:27.240 --> 15:29.860
I know you guys use humor
to deal with things,

15:30.070 --> 15:32.140
but D.J. was really
happy about this job,

15:32.150 --> 15:34.930
and now he's depressed about the
possibility of getting fired.

15:35.020 --> 15:36.430
Oh, he's getting fired.

15:36.440 --> 15:38.700
I'm... I'm sorry. Humor.

15:38.720 --> 15:40.660
Yeah, you're right. It's wrong.

15:40.820 --> 15:43.270
Did you know he's been
seeing a therapist at the VA

15:43.280 --> 15:44.839
for the last two years?

15:44.840 --> 15:46.780
No.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.190
Look, please don't tell him I told you.

15:49.200 --> 15:51.060
He's so proud, he wouldn't even tell you

15:51.070 --> 15:52.560
what that chicken soup did to him.

15:57.160 --> 16:00.020
You can't take off the tray
table and answer the door?

16:00.030 --> 16:02.860
I can, but evidently I don't have to.

16:04.820 --> 16:05.979
Hey, Brian.

16:05.980 --> 16:07.180
Are you guys eating dinner or anything?

16:07.200 --> 16:09.160
- I don't want to interrupt.
- No, no. Come on in.

16:09.200 --> 16:11.240
I was gonna call you, but I...

16:11.300 --> 16:13.400
I really needed to
talk to you in person.

16:15.260 --> 16:17.390
Oh, I know what you're doing here.

16:17.400 --> 16:19.350
You're coming in all sad-looking

16:19.360 --> 16:21.660
and then you're gonna
give us a big, old check.

16:22.580 --> 16:25.440
Not exactly. I talked to the
company's lawyers today.

16:25.460 --> 16:26.460
And?

16:26.560 --> 16:29.720
They decided they're gonna
fight this out in court.

16:29.760 --> 16:32.440
Wait. But w-we'll still win, right?

16:32.940 --> 16:34.780
Here's how their lawyer put it to me.

16:34.800 --> 16:36.640
You know how you put a
coin in a vending machine

16:36.660 --> 16:39.260
and that cinnamon bun
you're craving gets stuck?

16:39.280 --> 16:40.490
Yeah.

16:41.780 --> 16:43.600
And then you're at the point
where you have to decide,

16:43.610 --> 16:44.980
are you gonna put more money in,

16:44.990 --> 16:47.320
hoping it will be pushed
further and drop,

16:47.400 --> 16:49.219
or do you just go for the Life Savers

16:49.220 --> 16:50.980
'cause you know they'll roll out easy?

16:52.020 --> 16:54.200
Could you simplify this?
I'm about to throw up.

16:55.570 --> 16:56.850
They're offering a settlement.

16:56.860 --> 16:58.230
It's not as much as we'd hoped for.

16:58.240 --> 16:59.310
How much is it?

16:59.320 --> 17:00.810
No pain and suffering.

17:00.820 --> 17:03.730
Just money for medical bills,
and after my fees come out,

17:03.740 --> 17:06.000
you'll be just a little short.

17:06.099 --> 17:09.230
We're gonna be short? You
promised us six figures.

17:09.240 --> 17:10.760
Oh, I was hoping for six figures,

17:10.780 --> 17:12.420
but these guys are threatening
to drag this out.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.140
It could take years.

17:14.150 --> 17:15.839
I recommend you take the settlement.

17:16.030 --> 17:17.760
God, this sucks. You know what?

17:17.780 --> 17:20.030
You're the last person I
ever hire off a gas pump.

17:21.060 --> 17:23.020
We'll take the offer.

17:24.109 --> 17:25.270
No.

17:25.280 --> 17:26.660
You know what? If we're taking this,

17:26.680 --> 17:28.140
then D.J. has to keep his job.

17:28.150 --> 17:29.730
That's the deal.

17:29.740 --> 17:32.020
- I can do that.
- Thanks.

17:32.030 --> 17:33.660
Let me walk you out.

17:35.480 --> 17:37.810
You know, I just want you to
know, I had every intention

17:37.820 --> 17:39.310
of sticking it to those guys for you.

17:39.320 --> 17:40.660
No, you didn't.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.520
You were looking for a fat
settlement and a quick payout.

17:43.700 --> 17:45.560
They offered you half,
and I got you more.

17:45.580 --> 17:46.800
In my book, that's a win.

17:46.820 --> 17:49.440
That's no win. You set us up.

17:49.540 --> 17:51.099
You made my family think that

17:51.100 --> 17:52.699
things were gonna work out for once,

17:52.700 --> 17:54.380
and then you bailed on us.

17:54.860 --> 17:56.320
I should have known better.

17:56.380 --> 17:59.180
No other lawyer would have
done anything different.

17:59.260 --> 18:01.440
That's the first honest
thing you've said to me.

18:01.470 --> 18:04.040
Hey. You took a shot.

18:04.440 --> 18:06.020
If you'd lost the arm,

18:06.030 --> 18:08.240
I think you'd be in much better shape.

18:10.740 --> 18:12.300
I have to go inside now

18:12.330 --> 18:14.900
and tell my grandkids why
I have to let them down.

18:14.920 --> 18:18.000
If I ever see you again,
I will kick your ass,

18:18.020 --> 18:20.480
and then I will throw you into the sea.

18:20.620 --> 18:22.560
And there's no point in suing me.

18:22.620 --> 18:24.360
As you know, we ain't got no money.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.140
Hey, buddy.

18:29.260 --> 18:31.820
Hey, Grandpa. You don't have to tell me.

18:31.840 --> 18:33.100
I heard.

18:33.360 --> 18:35.800
People don't always come through, pal.

18:35.860 --> 18:38.800
I didn't really want to go
to that art class anyway.

18:38.980 --> 18:40.390
It's gonna be in the summer,

18:40.400 --> 18:42.280
and there's other stuff I'd rather do.

18:42.360 --> 18:43.960
Oh, that's too bad, 'cause you're going.

18:44.000 --> 18:47.020
Really? But we can't afford it.

18:47.080 --> 18:48.500
You have to pay your doctor bills.

18:48.560 --> 18:50.890
That's my business, not yours.

18:50.980 --> 18:52.070
Thanks, Grandpa.

18:53.220 --> 18:54.500
What about me?

18:54.620 --> 18:57.180
You said I could think about
going to a real college.

18:57.240 --> 18:59.940
Yeah, fair is fair. You can
keep thinking about it.

19:02.620 --> 19:05.000
So, one of the reasons you
may have been looking

19:05.020 --> 19:07.540
for external validation from men

19:07.620 --> 19:10.380
is because you don't feel good

19:10.400 --> 19:12.960
about what you've
accomplished in your life.

19:13.060 --> 19:14.779
How can you say that?

19:14.780 --> 19:16.780
Look around you.

19:17.820 --> 19:20.480
So, we're gonna come up with a plan

19:20.500 --> 19:21.959
that helps you get a career

19:21.960 --> 19:23.850
so you can feel good about something

19:23.860 --> 19:25.360
more than just your pretty face.

19:25.380 --> 19:26.520
You think I'm pretty?

19:27.020 --> 19:29.380
Kidding. I know I'm pretty.

19:29.420 --> 19:32.340
So, what is your dream job?

19:32.440 --> 19:35.270
Okay, but don't laugh.

19:35.280 --> 19:37.860
I've always wanted to
work at the Field Museum.

19:38.840 --> 19:40.820
You know, in that room
where they clean off

19:40.850 --> 19:42.980
the fossils and the artifacts?

19:43.000 --> 19:44.550
I saw that on a field trip once,

19:44.580 --> 19:45.976
and I've never stopped
thinking about it.

19:46.000 --> 19:49.920
Wow, archaeologist. Uncovering history.

19:49.940 --> 19:51.520
Bringing the past to life.

19:51.550 --> 19:54.930
I brought materials on paralegal
and dental technician,

19:54.940 --> 19:57.240
but let's roll with this.

19:59.030 --> 20:00.326
I don't even know where to start.

20:00.350 --> 20:02.400
Well, Jackie's jewel number one...

20:02.430 --> 20:04.880
Find somebody who's doing
it and talk to them.

20:05.320 --> 20:07.939
Here's the Field Museum website.

20:07.940 --> 20:10.760
Maybe we make a few calls.
Maybe you could intern.

20:10.860 --> 20:13.990
Here's the manager of
the docent volunteers.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.040
He's cute.

20:16.100 --> 20:17.860
Oh, great.

20:18.030 --> 20:19.640
We can work on two things.

20:24.120 --> 20:26.440
Oh, Dad. I called the hospital.

20:26.500 --> 20:28.880
We qualify for an assistance program.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.390
Technically, we're indigent.

20:30.400 --> 20:31.480
Ow!

20:31.490 --> 20:33.640
Yeah!

20:33.660 --> 20:36.060
After paying off all
of the medical bills

20:36.070 --> 20:37.460
and Mark's art class,

20:37.500 --> 20:39.770
we have $645 left.

20:39.780 --> 20:42.360
Which part of Europe are
we gonna see first?

20:43.100 --> 20:44.940
We can go to Santa's Village!

20:45.000 --> 20:47.660
Oh, you remember how much fun that was?

20:47.680 --> 20:49.880
We would go in the petting zoo,
and then all those animals

20:49.890 --> 20:52.310
would jump up on us with
crap all over their feet,

20:52.320 --> 20:54.340
and then we'd go get gingerbread cookies

20:54.350 --> 20:56.140
without washing our
hands, and Dad would say,

20:56.160 --> 20:58.310
"You guys are gonna all get
sick," and then we did?

21:00.220 --> 21:02.270
I want to go!

21:02.280 --> 21:03.340
All right, all right.

21:03.360 --> 21:06.520
I say, though, it's Grandpa's
money, and he gets to decide.

21:06.540 --> 21:09.839
I've always been a fan of
the mail-order steaks.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.740
How about we order 30 of them?

21:12.760 --> 21:15.140
I will eat one filet a night

21:15.150 --> 21:17.100
for 30 consecutive nights.

21:17.160 --> 21:19.760
It will be known as the
"month of mignon."

21:21.980 --> 21:25.100
Oh. Wow. You're a good dad.
You're not gonna linger.
