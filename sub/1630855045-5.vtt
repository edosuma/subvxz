WEBVTT

00:08.883 --> 00:12.345
<i>We knew who we were
and what we were becoming.</i>

00:16.558 --> 00:20.645
<i>Resplendent,
as in magnificent, as in luminous,</i>

00:20.770 --> 00:22.272
<i>as in gleaming, glittering...</i>

00:22.272 --> 00:25.108
<i>- ...glorious stars about to blaze.</i>

00:34.617 --> 00:36.244
<i>The thing
about a fire, though...</i>

00:37.495 --> 00:38.747
Whoo!

00:39.330 --> 00:41.458
<i>...is that it can burn too fast.</i>

00:55.847 --> 00:58.099
<i>The greatest legacy
we can share</i>

00:58.266 --> 01:00.560
<i>is the one etched
into the pages of our heart.</i>

01:09.402 --> 01:10.904
<i>When the story of our life is written,</i>

01:11.362 --> 01:13.698
<i>no one will remember
whether we won or lost,</i>

01:14.199 --> 01:16.534
<i>only that we made our mark
playing the game.</i>

01:17.577 --> 01:21.164
<i>In the end, the only things
that will matter are how we loved,</i>

01:21.414 --> 01:23.083
<i>what we left behind,</i>

01:23.333 --> 01:25.376
<i>and who is going to carry that weight.</i>

01:34.260 --> 01:35.970
How long are y’all
gonna continue like this?

01:36.763 --> 01:37.931
We just took quarters.

01:37.931 --> 01:40.892
The only thing y'all should be focusing on
is the semifinals.

01:41.101 --> 01:43.728
I can’t focus on anything
until someone tells me why I’m grounded,

01:43.728 --> 01:46.940
have no phone, and can’t leave the house
for something I didn’t do.

01:47.941 --> 01:49.234
Don’t act like Mr. Perfect.

01:49.234 --> 01:52.529
You were gonna have Alexis over while Mom
and Dad were at their anniversary dinner.

01:52.529 --> 01:55.115
But that didn’t happen, did it?
Instead, she’s ghosting me

01:55.240 --> 01:57.075
because you wanted to cause a scene
in front of my girl.

01:57.075 --> 02:00.078
- Your girl?  Or Aniq’s girl?
Hey, Filth.

02:01.788 --> 02:04.707
Now, I know this beef is about
what happened down at the Roll Call.

02:04.833 --> 02:07.252
But both of y’all got played
by your emotions.

02:07.377 --> 02:10.130
Now, look. Things is about to get real
for the both of y’all.

02:10.672 --> 02:13.424
High school is about building
a whole new legacy.

02:13.424 --> 02:16.636
And y'all need to figure out who you are
before somebody else does it for you.

02:16.761 --> 02:20.223
And right now, Aniq and your emotions
is running point.

02:35.864 --> 02:38.992
- Yo, Mom, we’re home.
- And kept me waiting, too.

02:39.117 --> 02:40.743
- Ooh, Granny!
- Grandma!

02:40.743 --> 02:42.871
Mm. My babies!

02:42.996 --> 02:46.291
- Oh, look how big you are.

02:46.291 --> 02:49.502
Oh! Filthy,
you getting a mustache?

02:49.502 --> 02:53.256
Oh, JB,
I should have worn a swimsuit.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.259
- Those waves making me miss the ocean.

02:56.384 --> 02:58.845
Did I hear my nephews?

02:58.845 --> 03:01.014
Yo! Let's go!
Yo!

03:01.014 --> 03:03.057
What's up? What's up? Hey, lil' Chuck!

03:03.057 --> 03:04.934
Let me see that...
Let me see that twin shake.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.019
All right.

03:08.104 --> 03:09.898
Boy, you better stop
looking like Travis Scott.

03:09.898 --> 03:10.982
- Come here!

03:10.982 --> 03:12.233
Hey, there he is!

03:12.358 --> 03:14.027
- There goes my brother!
- What up? What up? What up?

03:14.027 --> 03:15.528
- Good to see you.
- What’s wrong with y’all?

03:15.737 --> 03:17.822
Looking like two hound dogs
who lost the scent.

03:17.947 --> 03:19.073
Mm-hmm.

03:19.199 --> 03:21.659
They got wrapped up
in some pre-high school drama.

03:22.076 --> 03:24.996
Nothing that a little punishment
and good food won’t fix.

03:24.996 --> 03:26.080
You’re ordering out?

03:27.582 --> 03:29.375
Actually, I’m cooking.

03:29.375 --> 03:33.880
Oh, God. Those frowns
aren’t going anywhere anytime soon.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.425
- Come on, girl, everybody know.

03:37.425 --> 03:38.551
You got a lead hand

03:38.676 --> 03:40.386
- when it comes to seasoning.

03:40.386 --> 03:42.347
- Oh, Mama, I missed you.
- Stop laughing.

03:42.347 --> 03:44.849
Missed you too.
And a little birdie told me

03:45.016 --> 03:47.644
you just might need to see your mama
right about now.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.354
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.147
- A little birdie, huh?
Mm-hmm.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.232
Was this a brown bird?

03:52.357 --> 03:54.067
Mm-hmm.
Okay.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.485
<i>Babe, you called my mama?</i>

03:55.610 --> 03:57.820
Chuck, we need family
more than ever right now,

03:57.946 --> 04:00.949
no matter how sarcastic
they are about my cooking.

04:01.449 --> 04:04.118
Don’t get me wrong, okay?
I mean, I'm... I’m excited.

04:04.244 --> 04:06.663
Don’t I look excited? I love surprises.

04:06.663 --> 04:08.539
I didn’t think
she would come the next day.

04:08.539 --> 04:11.918
- Baby, don’t you know my mama?
- I thought at least 48 hours.

04:12.627 --> 04:16.422
All right, now. Just so you know,
when it comes down to cooking,

04:16.422 --> 04:19.217
- my mom and Skinny, they don’t play.
- Mm, yeah, I've heard.

04:19.217 --> 04:21.719
So, I hope you have enough
of those smoked turkey wings.

04:22.637 --> 04:23.888
Actually, I do not.

04:24.472 --> 04:28.309
And that is why I need you to go
to the store. Take the boys with you.

04:28.518 --> 04:31.688
As for Skinny, I don’t know what to say
about that. Take him with you.

04:31.688 --> 04:34.023
He may not be blood,
but he might as well be.

04:34.774 --> 04:36.734
Just make sure you put your purse
in the closet.

04:37.568 --> 04:39.612
- I’m just kidding, babe.
No, you not.

04:39.612 --> 04:41.906
You just make sure
you have a talk with her.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.409
Talk with me? About what?

04:44.993 --> 04:49.330
About how excited I am to see you.
- Aw.

04:49.664 --> 04:51.833
I’m excited too.
You know what I’m excited about?

04:52.917 --> 04:56.296
Groceries on the kitchen counter
in 30 minutes.

04:56.296 --> 04:58.047
Mm. Okay.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.590
Filthy!

04:59.716 --> 05:01.217
JB, let’s go!

05:02.427 --> 05:04.345
- We leaving again.
Where we going?

05:04.345 --> 05:07.765
And I’m excited to hear
what it is you wanna talk to me about.

05:09.642 --> 05:13.521
Just how do I not be heavy-handed
with the seasoning?

05:14.022 --> 05:15.815
Oh, girl, that’s a long conversation.

05:16.524 --> 05:18.234
- But you know what it starts with?
- What?

05:18.776 --> 05:20.361
Using a measuring spoon.

05:21.154 --> 05:24.615
- Got it. Measuring spoon.
- Mm-mm. Measuring spoons. Uh-huh.

05:24.615 --> 05:28.286
Because the problem is,
you keep trying to improvise.

05:28.578 --> 05:31.748
Well, 'cause I thought you feel it
from your soul, you know? You seas...

05:31.748 --> 05:34.417
I know. But your soul got to be right,
baby. You see?

05:34.876 --> 05:38.880
It’s got to be in tune, you know?
That takes a little time.

05:39.547 --> 05:41.132
All right. Let's go.

05:42.717 --> 05:46.971
Whoo! All right, huddle up.
All right, look. We got 30 minutes.

05:46.971 --> 05:48.264
- We're gonna spread out.
- All right.

05:48.264 --> 05:50.391
Filthy, you take the left,
focus on the produce.

05:50.391 --> 05:51.976
JB, you have the dairy.

05:52.101 --> 05:54.103
- Got it.
- Bypass the snack section.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.563
- No distractions.
- Mm-hmm.

05:55.563 --> 05:58.024
You hear him, you hear him.
So, where you want me, Chuck?

05:58.858 --> 06:00.735
Oh, come on.
How you gonna do me like that?

06:00.735 --> 06:02.528
I drove with your mama’s
uncontrollable gas

06:02.528 --> 06:04.697
and you ain’t even gonna
put me in the game, coach?

06:04.697 --> 06:06.783
Absolutely not. You’re with me.

06:08.117 --> 06:11.913
Can I at least push the cart?
-  Diva! Y'all, come on.

06:21.756 --> 06:23.633
What's up, man?
- How’d you get a hold of us?

06:23.633 --> 06:24.842
Thought you didn’t have a phone.

06:24.842 --> 06:28.679
Well, me and Filthy found this antique
in the attic. It’s crazy, man.

06:28.679 --> 06:31.474
It looks like a radio,
but when you spin the numbers, it dials.

06:31.599 --> 06:34.227
Can’t decide if I’m more impressed
that you figured out

06:34.227 --> 06:35.395
how to work that thing,

06:35.770 --> 06:37.355
or that you memorized my phone number.

06:37.855 --> 06:39.148
You heard from Alexis?

06:39.816 --> 06:41.901
How? I’m grounded, man.

06:42.276 --> 06:44.320
Parentals haven’t let us out the house
since Friday.

06:44.320 --> 06:47.073
Well, consider your punishment halted
for the next 30 minutes.

06:47.448 --> 06:48.449
Thank you.

06:49.659 --> 06:50.660
All right.

06:51.619 --> 06:53.830
Looks like she went to Burger Palace
with Treasure and Addyson.

06:53.830 --> 06:54.914
Hold up.

06:55.790 --> 06:58.084
That burger looks smack. Can’t even lie.

06:58.918 --> 07:00.670
Can you focus on anything other than food?

07:00.795 --> 07:02.171
I think you know the answer to that.

07:04.465 --> 07:05.466
All right.

07:06.676 --> 07:09.262
They also went to see
that new Marvel movie, then bowling.

07:10.138 --> 07:13.850
If all three of them are in that picture,
who’s taking the photo?

07:15.143 --> 07:16.144
What are you ?

07:17.186 --> 07:20.857
I hate to say this
but Beacon prom in less than a month,

07:21.357 --> 07:23.568
Aniq might have his eyes
on a potential date.

07:27.447 --> 07:29.365
<i>Any available cashier needed up front.</i>

07:29.365 --> 07:31.701
Dad's gonna freak
when he sees these prices.

07:31.701 --> 07:33.286
Heads up!

07:34.370 --> 07:37.999
- A simple "Hello" would have been nice.
- Still World War III in the Bells house?

07:38.166 --> 07:40.209
- JB blames me for everything.

07:40.209 --> 07:44.297
- Aniq. Alexis. Him getting grounded.
- Hang in there, he’ll come around.

07:44.589 --> 07:47.592
But it might be a minute
after Aniq’s last Instagram post.

07:48.134 --> 07:49.177
What post?

07:49.385 --> 07:53.139
Well, rumor has it,
he wants to invite Alexis to Beacon prom.

07:53.389 --> 07:55.558
Look what he put on his story
a few hours ago.

07:59.187 --> 08:01.981
JB is never gonna talk to me
when he finds out.

08:02.607 --> 08:05.193
Oh, Aniq is desperate
for Alexis’s attention.

08:05.735 --> 08:08.321
I’ve gotta do something.
Something that’s gonna make this right.

08:10.907 --> 08:12.783
Oh, boyfriend calling?

08:13.868 --> 08:16.829
Seems like it’s not just Aniq
who's looking for some attention.

08:16.829 --> 08:20.082
How many times do I have to tell you?
He’s not my boyfriend.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.460
- Oh, really? Let me answer it.
- No!

08:22.460 --> 08:25.087
- Yes, give me the... Gimme... the phone!
- No.

08:26.380 --> 08:30.134
Hey. Oh, okay. Yeah.
I’ll call you back in a few minutes.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.971
-  Okay, bye.
-  "Bye."

08:34.555 --> 08:35.932
- You and Zuma seem

08:35.932 --> 08:38.518
to be kicking it pretty hard
for you guys to be "just friends."

08:38.684 --> 08:42.563
Okay, look. Zuma and I don’t kick it
any differently than you and I do.

08:43.231 --> 08:45.191
And nothing’s ever happened
between us, right?

08:45.775 --> 08:49.445
Look, all I’m saying
is you can’t control everything.

08:49.820 --> 08:52.823
- Not JB, not Alexis and not Zuma.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.701
You just gotta be okay
with the way things play out.

08:59.080 --> 09:00.706
Hmm.

09:01.624 --> 09:04.293
That big promotion
is doing wonders for you.

09:04.460 --> 09:05.461
Oh.

09:05.461 --> 09:08.464
And that hair,
oh it's making a statement now.

09:08.631 --> 09:13.678
Thank you. Yeah, I love it.
It’s sophisticated, you know.

09:13.803 --> 09:14.804
Mm-hmm.

09:14.804 --> 09:17.014
I’d wear it too
if I had a little peanut head.

09:26.524 --> 09:28.568
- Okay, I think it’s ready for the celery.
Yeah?

09:28.693 --> 09:30.403
Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

09:54.885 --> 09:59.307
Uh! Now, you know it’s bad luck
to mess up somebody else’s recipe.

09:59.307 --> 10:03.060
Well, if somebody else could really cook.
How about we play a game of dominoes

10:03.060 --> 10:05.062
while we wait for that groceries to come?

10:05.688 --> 10:07.898
And some of this salt to boil off?

10:08.024 --> 10:10.443
Hmm. Can’t wait.

10:10.443 --> 10:12.320
You want me to put the onions in too?

10:12.653 --> 10:15.281
- Might as well.
- Okay.

10:24.415 --> 10:26.751
- Now, what’s this supposed to be, now?
- Goulash.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.169
- Goulash.
- Mm-hmm.

10:28.169 --> 10:31.422
- You ever had it?
- No. How’s it 'posed to taste?

10:32.131 --> 10:34.300
Flavorful. You know, savory.

10:34.884 --> 10:36.385
Oh, savory?
Mm-hmm.

10:36.385 --> 10:40.723
Well, we just gotta keep working on it,
and we might get there.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.435
I am not messing with you today, ma'am.

10:49.148 --> 10:50.316
Come on, Crystal.

10:50.316 --> 10:53.110
How long is it gonna take you
before you make your next move?

10:53.110 --> 10:56.989
Patience, Barbara. Patience.

10:58.240 --> 11:00.743
You better up your game
'cause I’m 'bout to break this table.

11:05.873 --> 11:10.002
I see you, running around,
asking everybody how they doing.

11:11.712 --> 11:14.423
- When's the last time somebody asked you?
Hmm.

11:14.965 --> 11:18.427
Well, if you're asking, right now...

11:21.722 --> 11:23.140
Well, to be honest...

11:24.684 --> 11:25.935
I’m mad at myself.

11:27.603 --> 11:30.439
I know that son of yours
hates the doctors.

11:31.774 --> 11:35.194
I still can’t help
but feel like I’m failing my family.

11:36.028 --> 11:37.238
You sound like me.

11:37.488 --> 11:40.866
For the longest time, I blamed myself
after Chuck’s father passed.

11:42.576 --> 11:44.328
But these men are grown,

11:44.912 --> 11:47.206
and you can’t catch it all the time.
This isn’t on you.

11:47.748 --> 11:50.084
See?

11:50.209 --> 11:52.545
That’s the problem with a strong,
Black woman right there.

11:53.212 --> 11:54.630
She’s a fixer.

11:55.506 --> 11:57.717
My mother did it, I did it,
and now you doing it.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.636
Well, what am I supposed to do
if he doesn’t...

12:06.976 --> 12:09.478
How am I gonna raise these boys on my own?

12:10.020 --> 12:12.732
You won’t. And we don’t talk like that.

12:13.774 --> 12:16.569
Because I will be here for Filthy and JB.

12:18.237 --> 12:19.488
All of you.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.578
Dominoes, sucker!

12:25.578 --> 12:26.954
Wow.

12:27.121 --> 12:28.914
- You tried to make me cry

12:28.914 --> 12:30.374
so you could win.
That’s what you doing.

12:30.374 --> 12:31.375
- I see you.

12:31.375 --> 12:32.626
Yeah.

12:32.626 --> 12:34.170
Uh-oh,

12:34.170 --> 12:36.464
- Mom's gonna flip.
- What was that?

12:37.047 --> 12:40.760
I don’t know. But whoever it is,
better not have broken those eggs!

12:40.760 --> 12:41.886
You heard her!

12:42.762 --> 12:43.929
Would you relax?

12:43.929 --> 12:46.432
Technically,
Aniq hasn’t even asked Alexis to the prom.

12:46.557 --> 12:49.226
It’s just speculation.
You could be overreacting for no reason.

12:49.852 --> 12:52.646
Look, look at this as a blessing
in disguise.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.523
Clearly Alexis likes the clout.

12:54.523 --> 12:57.026
Which gives us the opportunity to focus

12:57.026 --> 13:00.863
on getting into Beacon,
then you can show Aniq up, then boom!

13:00.988 --> 13:02.281
You’re back on her radar.

13:02.531 --> 13:04.366
How have you managed
to singlehandedly ruin

13:04.366 --> 13:07.119
my last year at Hughes?
I swear I don’t get you, man.

13:14.543 --> 13:15.669
Love you, too.

13:23.803 --> 13:25.429
(IN THE DISTANCE) Oh!

13:25.429 --> 13:27.765
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

13:27.765 --> 13:30.100
<i>Mm, got you, brother.</i>
<i>Wrong catch.</i>

13:30.100 --> 13:33.187
<i>Yo, you gotta come here.
Come over here, come over here.</i>

13:33.187 --> 13:36.565
- No, but... real talk, Chuck.

13:38.567 --> 13:40.569
- What’s the good word from your doc?
- Ah.

13:41.111 --> 13:42.112
Man.

13:42.905 --> 13:46.659
They said eventually I might...
need a kidney.

13:46.992 --> 13:49.453
You know,
being that I’m this blood type O,

13:50.079 --> 13:51.914
that makes that complicated.

13:52.122 --> 13:54.124
- It’s really like that, huh?
Yeah, man.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.418
So, how long you have to wait?

13:57.378 --> 13:58.671
I mean, it depends.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.757
- It might be a minute.
- I’m gonna pick up another snack cake.

14:01.757 --> 14:04.093
This is a little too much blood talk
for your boy.

14:04.093 --> 14:06.178
Yeah, they want me to look
for a living donor.

14:06.178 --> 14:09.515
So, are you gonna get everyone
in the family tested?

14:09.515 --> 14:12.810
Man, I can’t ask the boys to do that.
I mean, they’re kids.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.937
Plus, they gotta be over 18.

14:17.940 --> 14:20.109
See, this is what you do.
You playing stupid with me, man.

14:20.234 --> 14:23.988
You know I’m not...
Chuck, I’m not talking about the boys.

14:24.905 --> 14:25.990
What about asking Kelli?

14:25.990 --> 14:27.157
- Bro.
- Ask Kelli what?

14:28.284 --> 14:31.412
Boy, you just popping up outta nowhere.
You like my ex-girlfriend. What you...

14:32.872 --> 14:36.542
Anyway, okay. So, Pops has told me
that you and your brother

14:36.542 --> 14:37.877
got into a little entanglement.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.336
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

14:39.503 --> 14:41.964
Yeah? So, you know Uncle Skinny
gonna keep it real.

14:42.423 --> 14:46.635
Okay, I don’t care if it’s Alexis
or Mercedes Benz.

14:47.469 --> 14:51.765
You gotta stay tight
and keep it right with the fam.

14:52.182 --> 14:53.893
Anyway. Chuck, you know

14:53.893 --> 14:55.978
- what these boys need right now?

14:56.145 --> 14:58.105
- Jungle, jungle, jungle, jungle!
- Jungle, jungle, jungle!

14:58.230 --> 15:00.065
- Jungle Ball! Jungle Ball!
- Jungle Ball! Jungle Ball...

15:00.065 --> 15:01.150
Jungle Ball!

15:01.150 --> 15:03.903
- What the heck is Jungle Ball?
Out here, boy! Come on.

15:04.612 --> 15:06.780
<i>Jungle Ball,
a rite of passage.</i>

15:06.780 --> 15:08.407
Hey, yo.
This how it's like?

15:08.407 --> 15:09.950
You know,
this is a grown folks game, right?

15:09.950 --> 15:11.410
<i>No rules. No refs.</i>

15:11.410 --> 15:12.870
<i>Just pure adrenaline,</i>

15:12.870 --> 15:14.371
<i>- and heart and revenge.</i>

15:14.371 --> 15:17.291
Like I said, whatever your issues are,
work it out on the court.

15:17.291 --> 15:18.626
Let’s play two-on-two.

15:18.751 --> 15:20.502
<i>If the little lions got beef,</i>

15:20.794 --> 15:22.630
<i>we take it to the court
until it’s settled.</i>

15:22.630 --> 15:24.048
Knock 'em down. Knock 'em down.

15:24.048 --> 15:25.257
- Good!

15:25.257 --> 15:27.259
<i>Find out
who the real king is.</i>

15:27.551 --> 15:28.427
You’re an embarrassment.

15:28.427 --> 15:30.387
I should have never brought you there
in the first place.

15:30.387 --> 15:32.473
The only thing that's embarrassing
is you trying so hard

15:32.473 --> 15:33.807
to fit in with Aniq and his crew

15:33.933 --> 15:36.143
- that you ruined my relationship.
- What relationship?

15:36.143 --> 15:37.603
Come on, man.
- Man, get off me, man.

15:38.479 --> 15:40.648
Yeah, yeah. Come on, come on.
Beat him down.

15:40.648 --> 15:43.943
- Okay! Okay. Oh, crossover!
- Get 'em up! Get 'em up

15:44.068 --> 15:45.694
- Oh! Straight to the hole!

15:46.236 --> 15:48.113
All right, ball. Thank you. Thank you.

15:48.572 --> 15:51.742
Nice, nice. Get open, get open.
Come on, come on.

15:52.326 --> 15:53.327
Oh, you want the screen?

15:53.327 --> 15:55.162
I don’t need it.
Filthy and his ankles ain’t ready.

15:55.162 --> 15:56.872
Oh, you shook? Huh, you scared?

15:56.872 --> 15:59.083
Everybody knows
you have a hard time focusing, JB.

16:02.586 --> 16:04.588
Oh!
- What were you saying?

16:05.047 --> 16:07.007
Yeah. I mean,
that boy looked pretty focused to me!

16:07.007 --> 16:08.425
That’s game point, fellas.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.011
Okay, y'all gonna eat
all that trash-talking.

16:11.011 --> 16:13.263
Don't let nobody live in your head
but you. You hear me now?

16:13.263 --> 16:15.933
Maybe I could if Filthy stopped trying
to be the center of attention.

16:15.933 --> 16:17.893
- So what, you jealous now?
Ain't nobody jealous, man.

16:17.893 --> 16:19.895
I'm just sick of you trying
to fight my battles.

16:19.895 --> 16:21.522
Trying to help you, us, get into Beacon.

16:21.522 --> 16:24.024
Don’t nobody need your help, Filthy,
'cause you’re not very good at it.

16:24.024 --> 16:25.359
You’re not just hijacking my plans,

16:25.359 --> 16:27.778
- you’re hijacking my life.
- What’s that supposed to mean?

16:28.570 --> 16:31.031
Have you ever considered
that maybe I don’t want to go to Beacon?

16:37.246 --> 16:39.039
Why’s everybody standing around here
like statues?

16:39.039 --> 16:41.417
You better come on in this house
and wash up for dinner.

16:41.417 --> 16:43.752
You ain't said nothin' but a word.
Coming through!

16:52.219 --> 16:53.429
<i>Uh-huh. Mm!</i>

16:53.429 --> 16:55.848
This is good.
Was this a collaborative effort with you?

16:55.973 --> 16:57.766
Mm.
- It was.

16:57.891 --> 16:59.893
- Thank you.
- She was under supervision.

17:00.978 --> 17:03.897
Okay. What? Hey! Hey, no, no.
Back to the conversation, okay?

17:04.023 --> 17:07.651
Here. Look, I don’t care
if it’s the best kidney clinic in Arizona.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.737
I don’t think that you should go, brother.

17:09.737 --> 17:12.364
Do I need to remind you
of the Tuskegee experiment?

17:12.364 --> 17:14.616
Look, I hear you. I do.

17:15.034 --> 17:16.201
But the mistrust of medicine

17:16.201 --> 17:19.204
is what got us in this predicament
in the first place. Is it not?

17:19.204 --> 17:21.248
Hey, come on.
Let’s not have this conversation.

17:21.248 --> 17:25.586
Crystal and I think that this clinic
would be very good for you.

17:25.753 --> 17:29.214
And we know you don’t wanna go,
but six weeks isn’t that long.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.383
Look. The boys,
they... they need me.

17:31.383 --> 17:35.387
We got the semifinals coming up.
This could be their last game at Hughes.

17:35.512 --> 17:37.431
- All right?

17:37.556 --> 17:40.893
- Are you excited about the game?
- Uh. I can’t wait.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.102
Now, I know all those coaches

17:42.227 --> 17:44.063
- will be there watching...

17:44.063 --> 17:45.314
...ready to scoop my babies up.

17:45.439 --> 17:47.524
I’ve got the plan on lock.

17:47.524 --> 17:49.359
Tell 'em, neph.
- Beacon's gonna get us

17:49.359 --> 17:52.196
into a college of choice, Duke, a given.

17:52.196 --> 17:54.907
Duke is going to send us straight
to the NBA,

17:54.907 --> 17:57.493
but not before signing
our endorsement deal

17:57.618 --> 18:00.120
- with, guess who? Nike!
Nike!

18:00.120 --> 18:01.830
No shade to Adidas
or nothing like that,

18:01.830 --> 18:04.041
- but I'm just saying like...
- May I please be excused?

18:09.546 --> 18:12.174
Uh. (CLEARS THROAT) Yes, you may.

18:13.842 --> 18:17.429
He hot like me.
This food is spicy.  Mm.

18:20.432 --> 18:24.686
No. No. What was I wearing?

18:25.938 --> 18:30.734
Man, I don’t know how you...
you dealt with it.

18:30.901 --> 18:31.944
With what?

18:32.486 --> 18:35.197
Being a teenager.

18:35.405 --> 18:39.034
You being a teenager? That was not easy.
Now, that is for damn sure.

18:39.159 --> 18:40.577
- That was not easy.

18:40.577 --> 18:43.247
But then there is nothing easy
about parenting.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.083
Yeah.

18:47.376 --> 18:49.378
- Thank you.
- For?

18:52.756 --> 18:57.261
For not telling Crystal
about my diagnosis, you know,

18:57.261 --> 18:59.054
until I was ready to tell her.

18:59.179 --> 19:02.683
Yeah. Three months is a long time
for me to hold the water.

19:04.393 --> 19:05.644
How’s she taking it?

19:06.186 --> 19:09.398
How Crystal takes everything.
Brave, facing it.

19:11.108 --> 19:16.113
- Just reassuring everybody around that...
Mm-hmm.

19:16.321 --> 19:19.908
...everything’s gonna be okay.
I mean, she’s ready to fight.

19:20.033 --> 19:22.077
- So am I.

19:22.077 --> 19:24.037
Well, that’s why
you should’ve told her then

19:24.246 --> 19:25.789
before you got to this point.

19:27.791 --> 19:28.834
Ma...

19:31.420 --> 19:36.425
...how come you and Dad
never told me that he was sick?

19:36.633 --> 19:39.428
That... that blindsided me.

19:44.766 --> 19:45.851
It was terminal.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.607
We didn't want you to be afraid.

19:52.816 --> 19:56.111
But to this day, not telling you
is one of my biggest regrets.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.655
Well, we wanna...

20:02.701 --> 20:05.454
Well, we're choosing to keep it real
with the boys.

20:05.579 --> 20:09.374
I want them to be prepared.
I want them to know everything.

20:09.666 --> 20:12.294
There’s a possibility that these meds,
that they...

20:13.045 --> 20:17.132
Hey. We gotta believe
in something greater than ourselves.

20:17.132 --> 20:19.134
What do I always tell you? Huh?

20:20.719 --> 20:24.932
Put it... put it in God’s hands.

20:27.935 --> 20:31.271
Yes. That's right.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.067
Oh, man.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.656
It’s gonna be all right.

20:43.659 --> 20:44.785
That's right.

20:46.870 --> 20:48.497
- Here we go.

20:50.040 --> 20:51.041
All right.

20:51.041 --> 20:54.920
All right, but let me get this straight,
okay? So, you...

20:55.087 --> 20:59.091
You decked a dude for insulting Chuck
and now JB doesn’t have a girlfriend?

20:59.299 --> 21:02.010
Ah, yeah, that sounds about right.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.888
Mm, you...
that math does not add up to me.

21:06.181 --> 21:07.891
Here. Come here and get this "H."

21:11.979 --> 21:14.523
Oh! Ooh!

21:16.400 --> 21:18.777
- Look. You don’t get it.
- Hmm.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.197
Dad needs us to get into Beacon. Okay?

21:22.197 --> 21:24.449
And JB's acting like
he wants to screw all that up.

21:24.658 --> 21:28.954
Okay, so, you think that you guys
getting into Beacon is gonna cure Chuck?

21:28.954 --> 21:30.872
- That's what you think? Hmm?

21:30.998 --> 21:34.668
Look. What he needs right now is family. Period.

21:35.002 --> 21:37.838
JB and I have been planning this
since we were five.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.423
He can’t just up
and change his mind. Like...

21:39.548 --> 21:42.676
Oh, okay. "He can’t just up and..."
No, no, no, you've been planning this.

21:42.801 --> 21:44.720
And you and JB are two completely
different people,

21:44.720 --> 21:47.806
and up until now, everything has gone
the way that you've wanted it to.

21:48.265 --> 21:50.434
And you know I love you,
but you’re selfish, man.

21:50.934 --> 21:55.022
You know you selfish.
Look, look. All right.

21:55.939 --> 21:57.357
There’s gonna be a lot of things

21:57.357 --> 21:59.943
outside of basketball
that mean a lot to JB,

22:01.486 --> 22:03.113
and you have to understand
that that’s okay.

22:03.113 --> 22:05.198
Because life ain’t all about ball.

22:06.408 --> 22:07.576
So, what is it about?

22:10.078 --> 22:15.959
Finding your shot and hitting it
before the buzzer sounds. You feel me?

22:16.668 --> 22:18.295
Look, take me and your pops,
for example, right?

22:18.295 --> 22:22.466
He went to the NBA, and I went back to...

22:22.883 --> 22:27.220
Whatever, it’s not important, all right?
The point is, is that the older we got,

22:27.721 --> 22:30.515
the more we realized that time
is precious...

22:31.600 --> 22:33.935
and tomorrow ain’t owed to nobody.

22:38.357 --> 22:42.402
Let that sink in. But while you do,
you can fix your jumper too.

22:42.402 --> 22:45.530
- All right, let's go.
- Oh, really? It's on!

22:49.951 --> 22:53.205
All right, boys. I’m heading out.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.332
Already?
- Mm-hmm.

22:56.500 --> 23:00.087
And it sure would be nice to see you
talking to your brother before I go.

23:01.922 --> 23:03.006
Sorry, Grandma.

23:06.968 --> 23:12.015
When I was younger,
my sister used to irk me to no end.

23:12.599 --> 23:15.352
Oh!
We’d get into the worst of it.

23:15.769 --> 23:18.772
And it took a long time
before we stopped butting heads.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.024
But as we got older,

23:21.024 --> 23:24.820
we realized that our time together
was precious.

23:26.196 --> 23:29.032
- Time with everyone is precious.
- Like Dad?

23:30.742 --> 23:33.286
Your father isn’t dying any time soon.

23:33.995 --> 23:35.747
But there will come a day
when your father,

23:35.747 --> 23:37.874
your mother and I won't be here.

23:39.084 --> 23:40.752
And you know what you’ll be left with?

23:42.504 --> 23:43.505
Each other.

23:44.714 --> 23:47.509
- That sounds depressing.

23:47.843 --> 23:51.138
Okay. Well, you just give it some thought.

23:51.972 --> 23:53.265
Come on.

23:58.395 --> 24:00.981
Filthy... behave yourself.

24:01.273 --> 24:02.315
Of course, Grandma.

24:04.234 --> 24:05.986
Give it some thought.

24:08.864 --> 24:09.948
- Yeah?
Yeah.

24:12.742 --> 24:14.202
And y'all need to clean this room up.

24:14.202 --> 24:17.414
Anything could be hiding up
underneath here. Oh, my goodness.

24:18.707 --> 24:21.793
Wait, wait. Grandma?
Uh. About what you said.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.712
That was fast thinking.

24:23.712 --> 24:27.507
Yeah, um, I was wondering, could I borrow
your phone for a quick second?

24:27.716 --> 24:30.844
Please? For your favorite grandbaby?

24:31.052 --> 24:32.304
All right.

24:32.929 --> 24:34.848
- Thank you.
- You have one minute.

24:34.973 --> 24:35.974
Thank you.

24:36.099 --> 24:39.019
- And don't you dare tell your mother.
'Course not.

24:45.692 --> 24:48.945
Mama. Thanks for coming
all the way down here.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.323
You know it was exactly what I needed.

24:53.408 --> 24:54.576
I don’t want you to go.

24:54.576 --> 24:57.287
You know I got to sleep
in my own bed.

24:57.454 --> 25:00.040
Skinny, come on.
You gotta get outta here before traffic.

25:00.040 --> 25:03.335
Okay. A brother just took...
All right, missy. All right.

25:03.460 --> 25:05.670
Take care of those boys and this family.

25:05.795 --> 25:09.424
- And especially yourself.
- I will. I’ll do my best.

25:09.424 --> 25:11.218
All right.
- Thank you.

25:11.218 --> 25:13.178
Come on, Skinny.
It's getting dark out here.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.971
Hey, you know you gonna miss me,
all right?

25:15.096 --> 25:17.349
- Mm. A little. Maybe.
Uh-huh. Good to see you.

25:18.517 --> 25:20.769
My man. Hey!
I'm here whenever, man.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.312
- Mm-hmm.
So, hit me, okay?

25:22.312 --> 25:25.232
- Man, don't wait so long next time.
I love you, boy.

25:27.400 --> 25:29.152
Do I hear a open invitation?

25:29.152 --> 25:31.196
Absolutely not. Safe travels, Skinny.

25:31.196 --> 25:32.489
S... Uh. Okay,

25:32.614 --> 25:33.907
- you know you gonna miss me.
- Mm-hmm.

25:34.032 --> 25:36.243
A brother just took a hot shower.
We love you.

25:36.243 --> 25:38.870
Your water temperature's...
Love you.

25:38.995 --> 25:41.706
Well, that went better
than expected.

25:42.207 --> 25:45.669
Sure did. It was a nice surprise.
Thank you.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.254
You're welcome.

25:49.506 --> 25:50.549
Whatcha thinking?

25:51.007 --> 25:52.008
Hmm.

25:52.509 --> 25:57.889
Master Skinny,
he suggested that I reach out to Kelli

25:58.473 --> 26:00.392
to see if she'd be a possible match.

26:01.268 --> 26:03.270
Being that the whole family
is getting tested.

26:03.270 --> 26:05.146
I've been meaning to for some time now.

26:05.272 --> 26:07.482
Hmm, we finally agree on something.

26:07.482 --> 26:10.860
Hmm.
- Well, you know I think it's a great idea.

26:10.860 --> 26:15.699
Hmm. Yeah. So, that means
we have to sit the boys down,

26:15.699 --> 26:17.701
have this whole conversation.

26:18.451 --> 26:21.246
- We were gonna have to sooner or later.
- Mm-hmm.

26:30.422 --> 26:33.800
Hi, uh, Mr. and Mrs. Bell. Is JB here?

26:33.925 --> 26:36.886
Uh, he is, but both of the boys
are on punishment.

26:36.886 --> 26:40.098
Actually, I invited her over.

26:41.182 --> 26:42.183
Did you?

26:42.767 --> 26:46.813
Look, I'm sorry,
but before you turn Alexis away,

26:46.980 --> 26:50.066
you can tack on another week
to my punishment.

26:50.191 --> 26:54.487
Just please give JB and Alexis
five minutes to talk. It’ll help.

27:02.245 --> 27:04.539
- Not now, Filthy.

27:07.083 --> 27:08.460
Yo, just come in.

27:18.428 --> 27:19.471
Alexis?

27:20.847 --> 27:23.391
- What are you doing here?
- Uh. You can thank Filthy.

27:26.061 --> 27:29.814
Figured you two need to talk.
Mom says you have five minutes, though.

27:47.165 --> 27:49.542
For real?

28:17.195 --> 28:20.907
Sorry, girl. Long day.
I’ve been meaning to get back to you.

28:21.032 --> 28:23.993
Please tell me this is not about
the pipes bursting again.

28:23.993 --> 28:25.995
The school's budget is already stretched.

28:25.995 --> 28:28.206
<i>That’s not why I’m calling.
Check your phone.</i>

28:28.998 --> 28:29.999
What is it?

28:32.127 --> 28:34.170
<i>Guys, stop!</i>

28:34.587 --> 28:37.340
<i>Security!</i>
<i>Stop!</i>

28:39.384 --> 28:40.468
Where’d you get this?

28:40.468 --> 28:42.887
<i>One of the students posted it
on their Instagram.</i>

28:43.138 --> 28:45.890
<i>The superintendent wants to meet with you
first thing tomorrow morning.</i>

29:26.890 --> 29:27.974
Hello.

29:29.809 --> 29:30.852
This is Chuck.

29:34.230 --> 29:35.273
It’s your dad.

29:40.779 --> 29:42.822
What's up, y’all? Let's get it!

29:42.822 --> 29:46.034
<i>Y'all are live
with LA’s two newly drafted Lakers!</i>

29:47.202 --> 29:50.205
<i>So, when you find
your north star, you go full tilt.</i>

29:50.205 --> 29:53.166
<i>Follow it like the gift that it is
before it fades away.</i>

29:53.166 --> 29:55.084
Don’t act like that. Come on, man...

29:55.084 --> 29:56.795
<i>To sample the Good Book,</i>

29:56.795 --> 29:58.880
<i>- no one knows the number of our days.</i>
- Hey, what's up?

29:58.880 --> 30:01.049
<i>-We just know there are dark days ahead.</i>
- Turn that off, man!

30:01.049 --> 30:02.926
Yo, the phone!
I'm driving. Can you...

30:05.136 --> 30:10.391
<i>And you find yourself
lost, off course, adrift. As in...</i>
