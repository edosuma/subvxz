WEBVTT

00:01.734 --> 00:04.938
And at exactly 19:00 hours

00:05.005 --> 00:06.072
Khadijah will arrive

00:06.139 --> 00:08.408
at the designated
Chinese restaurant

00:08.474 --> 00:11.311
with Synclaire's parents,
whom I'm referring to as

00:11.377 --> 00:13.446
Eagles one and two.

00:13.514 --> 00:15.549
Regine, it's an engagement party

00:15.616 --> 00:17.217
not "Mission Impossible."

00:18.619 --> 00:19.553
Says you.

00:19.620 --> 00:21.021
I gotta coordinate this thing

00:21.087 --> 00:22.989
for 12 bucks a person

00:23.056 --> 00:26.292
including the
Buddha beer fountain.

00:26.359 --> 00:29.395
All I care about is that
our parents get along, Overton.

00:29.462 --> 00:30.964
Oh, don't worry
about it, sweet pea.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.866
Uh, I know they didn't
hit it off too well

00:32.933 --> 00:34.167
when they spoke on the phone

00:34.234 --> 00:35.769
but as soon as
they meet each other

00:35.836 --> 00:38.672
they'll be closer than
pork and a pot sticker.

00:40.841 --> 00:42.576
Than fortune in a cookie.

00:42.643 --> 00:44.444
'Than chop and suey.'

00:44.511 --> 00:46.947
Oh, oh. Than raw fish
on white rice.

00:47.013 --> 00:48.615
Oh, oh, oh, wait now.
That's Japanese.

00:48.682 --> 00:49.716
Mm‐hmm.

00:49.783 --> 00:50.784
‐ Would you listen?
‐ That's alright.

00:50.851 --> 00:54.120
‐ Let's do Italian.
‐ Okay, uh, cal on zone.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.489
Uh, uh, um, Al and Pacino.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.258

Regine, how can you
still be working on that

01:31.798 --> 01:33.233
engagement party?

01:33.299 --> 01:36.202
You already have four
emergency evacuation plans.

01:36.269 --> 01:38.705
Including that stupid
helicopter thing.

01:38.772 --> 01:41.041
Oh, dear, the party is planned.

01:41.107 --> 01:43.176
I am now cocking the spring

01:43.243 --> 01:46.547
on a foolproof
Max and Kyle trap.

01:46.613 --> 01:48.414
Why you still
trying to find out

01:48.481 --> 01:50.517
if those two are
getting any swerve on?

01:52.218 --> 01:55.088
Because I feed
on drama, Khadijah.

01:55.155 --> 01:57.824
And this is an
all you can eat buffet.

01:59.860 --> 02:00.934
Hello, hello.

02:01.001 --> 02:03.403
Okay, Regine,
you said it was important.

02:03.469 --> 02:05.071
And I see that Max is involved.

02:05.138 --> 02:06.740
So I assume
we're taking rabies shots.

02:09.309 --> 02:10.342
If we're going
to the clinic

02:10.410 --> 02:12.846
let's get him fixed.

02:12.913 --> 02:14.515
It shouldn't take too long.

02:15.949 --> 02:19.819
If we're done with the
oh‐so‐clever fake bickering..

02:23.023 --> 02:25.091
...I'm doing the place cards
for the party.

02:25.158 --> 02:26.226
Who are you bringing?

02:26.292 --> 02:29.162
‐ I‐I don't know.
‐ Ah‐ha!

02:29.229 --> 02:31.264
You don't know.

02:31.331 --> 02:33.734
Because you don't have a date.

02:33.800 --> 02:35.301
Because you two have been

02:35.368 --> 02:37.904
seeing each other
behind my back.

02:39.405 --> 02:42.108
Regine, I'm currently
juggling three women.

02:42.175 --> 02:43.176
And I have not figured out

02:43.243 --> 02:45.411
which two to let
fall into the abyss

02:45.478 --> 02:48.248
of Kylelisness.

02:48.314 --> 02:49.315
Buh‐bye.

02:51.952 --> 02:53.854
Mm‐hmm.

02:53.920 --> 02:58.091
And, uh, what's
your story, Maxine?

02:59.425 --> 03:01.902
None of your damn business,
Inch High Private Eye.

03:05.338 --> 03:07.273
I'm telling you, if we don't
have dates for this party

03:07.340 --> 03:08.441
Regine is gonna to send out
the blood hounds.

03:08.509 --> 03:09.810
So, who are you
going to take?

03:09.876 --> 03:12.779
Maxine, if I bring a date,
it is not a question of who

03:12.846 --> 03:14.615
it is a question of which.

03:14.681 --> 03:16.650
With you,
it's a question of what.

03:18.018 --> 03:20.386
You know, you make
my skin crawl.

03:20.453 --> 03:22.022
Now, come here and kiss papa.

03:24.858 --> 03:26.326
Get off me!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

03:26.392 --> 03:28.962
‐ Get off me. Stop!
‐ Ha, ha, ha.

03:34.067 --> 03:35.669
Is the runt gone?

03:35.736 --> 03:39.205
Yeah, she ran upstairs yelling,
"Curses! Foiled again."

03:39.272 --> 03:41.274
Good, 'cause I need
a bogus date for this party.

03:41.341 --> 03:42.609
And I'm not sure
I can get one of my reserves

03:42.676 --> 03:44.110
on such short notice.

03:45.779 --> 03:47.681
Why don't you just take Kyle?

03:47.748 --> 03:51.217
Nobody cares whether you guys
are in a relationship.

03:51.284 --> 03:54.020
I mean, they may mock you,
but they won't care.

03:55.656 --> 03:58.458
We, we're not in a relationship.
We're just having sex.

04:00.967 --> 04:03.269
Really good sex, though.
Ha, ha, ha!

04:03.336 --> 04:04.905
‐ You're getting all freaky‐‐
‐ I know. Ha, ha. Look.

04:04.971 --> 04:07.207
Hey, you don't have to.. Just,
just get me somebody decent.

04:07.273 --> 04:09.275
He doesn't have to be,
"Thank you, Jesus," fine.

04:11.277 --> 04:12.713
Take Teddy.

04:12.779 --> 04:14.581
Come on, you know
he's sitting at home.

04:14.648 --> 04:17.750
That pathetic stiff
that spends an hour and a half

04:17.817 --> 04:20.220
tellin' you the history
of a paper clip?

04:20.286 --> 04:21.221
That's him.

04:21.286 --> 04:22.355
What's his number?

04:25.491 --> 04:26.627
Where is Khadijah?

04:26.693 --> 04:28.529
She was supposed
to be here with the Eagles

04:28.595 --> 04:30.096
three and a half minutes ago.

04:30.163 --> 04:32.432
I know what happened.
I'll tell you what happened.

04:32.498 --> 04:33.833
Our parents met outside

04:33.900 --> 04:35.969
and right now a James is
wrestling a Jones to the ground.

04:36.035 --> 04:38.004
That's what happened!
I can feel it.

04:38.071 --> 04:39.639
Oh, or maybe
they were just late.

04:39.706 --> 04:43.009
‐ Mom, dad.
‐ Aw, you look nice.

04:43.076 --> 04:45.245
‐ Oh, ho‐ho, hey.
‐ Ah!

04:45.311 --> 04:47.213
Oh, everybody?
These are my parents.

04:47.280 --> 04:49.716
She's mom, he's dad.

04:49.783 --> 04:52.619
Overton, you're even more
handsome than your pictures.

04:52.686 --> 04:54.688
Specially without
that three armed sweater

04:54.755 --> 04:56.156
Synclaire knit you.

04:56.222 --> 04:58.625
Got a little carried away.

04:58.692 --> 05:01.434
Well, it's a pleasure to finally
meet you, Mr. and Mrs. James.

05:01.502 --> 05:04.170
Oh, please, Overton,
call me dad.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.239
Or Mr. Dad, if you don't feel
comfortable yet.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.875
[guffaws]

05:08.942 --> 05:10.911
Now, with the collapse
of the Ming dynasty

05:10.977 --> 05:13.880
chopsticks were suddenly
popular again.

05:13.947 --> 05:17.551
Except for one critical
change in their design.

05:17.618 --> 05:19.986
Are you ready?

05:20.053 --> 05:21.722
Ah, what, who?

05:21.788 --> 05:24.357
The tips went
from round to square.

05:26.059 --> 05:28.962
Oh, the old
round to square story.

05:29.029 --> 05:29.963
[chuckles]

05:30.030 --> 05:32.498
Max, you're a lucky girl.

05:32.566 --> 05:34.735
Yeah, thanks for the hook‐up.

05:36.102 --> 05:37.671
Oh, hello, everyone.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.710
I would like you to meet,
Lisa DeLongpre.

05:43.777 --> 05:44.711
Hi, hi.

05:44.778 --> 05:46.980
You look familiar.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.982
[gasps]
The Secaucus Trekkie Convention.

05:52.152 --> 05:53.286
[chuckles]

05:53.353 --> 05:55.556
No, more likely
you've seen her enchanting

05:55.622 --> 06:00.260
visage on the covers of
Elle or Cosmopolitan, you know.

06:00.326 --> 06:03.436
And, don't miss
next month's British Vogue.

06:03.504 --> 06:05.438
I'll be sure
to wrap my fish in it.

06:08.274 --> 06:10.376
Kyle, a word.

06:10.443 --> 06:12.345
[laughs]

06:12.412 --> 06:13.847
You stay lovely, okay?

06:18.785 --> 06:21.287
I thought you're gonna bring
a bogus date like mine.

06:21.354 --> 06:23.289
Not some wannabe
Jet centerfold.

06:24.490 --> 06:25.892
Lisa is an old friend
who just

06:25.959 --> 06:26.993
happened to be
free this evening.

06:27.060 --> 06:29.062
So, um, I flew her
in from Los Angeles.

06:29.129 --> 06:30.396
You know,
I paid for everything.

06:31.798 --> 06:33.734
You won't even
give me cab fare.

06:35.068 --> 06:39.372
Maxine, we are not together.
Remember?

06:39.439 --> 06:41.708
[guffaws]

06:42.876 --> 06:43.810
[hoots]

06:45.111 --> 06:47.247
To be perfectly honest,
I was kind of nervous

06:47.313 --> 06:48.448
when I popped the question

06:48.515 --> 06:51.552
until Synclaire said,
"Oh, oh, oh. Wait, now. Yes."

06:52.819 --> 06:55.255
Now, I'm looking forward
to a lifetime of happiness.

06:55.321 --> 06:56.356
Well, son,
I'll tell you.

06:56.422 --> 06:57.891
Marriage is a lot like prison.

06:57.958 --> 06:58.892
Except, the food isn't as good

06:58.959 --> 07:01.768
and your cellmate
never changes.

07:01.835 --> 07:03.937
Clinton, you're just
a joke machine.

07:04.004 --> 07:06.406
And that won't work
for nobody but you.

07:06.472 --> 07:07.708
[laughs]

07:07.774 --> 07:11.477
‐ Pumpkin!
‐ Hey! Hey!

07:11.545 --> 07:14.314
Alright, now.
The Jones' in the house.

07:14.380 --> 07:15.782
‐ That's right!
‐ That's right!

07:17.250 --> 07:20.186
‐ Lumpy! Is that you?
‐ Yes..

07:20.253 --> 07:22.055
Oh, honey.

07:22.122 --> 07:24.591
My little lump.

07:24.658 --> 07:27.127
A‐and don't eat too many
of them Chinese dumplings.

07:27.193 --> 07:31.364
Or you'll blow up like the
Michelin man again, Lumpy.

07:31.431 --> 07:34.434
Yeah, well, it's good
to see you, too, Mr. Jones.

07:34.501 --> 07:37.771
‐ Mother Jones, Mother Jones.
‐ Oh, pretty lady.

07:37.838 --> 07:39.506
‐ Oh, that's so sweet.
‐ Thank you.

07:39.573 --> 07:42.609
Oh, Father Jones,
give me some love. Oh, ha, ha.

07:42.676 --> 07:46.412
Ooh, have you lost weight,
gained some hair?

07:46.479 --> 07:48.615
‐ Both.
‐ Oh, my.

07:48.682 --> 07:50.784
And I like it.

07:53.353 --> 07:55.889
Well, here we are.

07:55.956 --> 07:58.859
Mom, dad, I'd like you
to meet two people

07:58.925 --> 08:00.594
I know you're gonna love.

08:00.661 --> 08:04.204
He is an electrical contractor
who hails from Cleveland.

08:04.270 --> 08:05.839
She's a homemaker
whose hobbies

08:05.906 --> 08:09.610
include shopping and Tai Chi.

08:09.676 --> 08:12.746
Won't you please say hello
to Otis and Odelle Jones.

08:12.813 --> 08:14.147
Give 'em some love.

08:17.818 --> 08:19.720
They call this a rib?

08:19.786 --> 08:22.989
Now, what kind of midget pig
did this come from?

08:23.056 --> 08:26.459
Probably grazed on the same farm
they grew this baby corn.

08:26.527 --> 08:27.794
‐ So, you're right.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

08:27.861 --> 08:30.263
But if you wanna see
some serious meat..

08:30.330 --> 08:32.097
...you gotta come to the
next Jones family barbeque.

08:32.164 --> 08:33.198
Alright.

08:33.265 --> 08:34.900
Ribs bigger than my son's head.

08:36.602 --> 08:38.238
Alright, I'm gonna
take that as a compliment.

08:38.304 --> 08:39.405
‐ Mm‐hmm.
‐ That's right.

08:39.472 --> 08:42.142
I can bring
my famous yamaloaf.

08:42.207 --> 08:43.577
‐ Yamaloaf!
‐ Yoo!

08:43.644 --> 08:44.945
Sounds like
a family affair to me.

08:45.011 --> 08:45.946
(all)
Mm.

08:46.012 --> 08:47.413
Oh, isn't this so sweet?

08:47.480 --> 08:48.715
Feels like it's
a phone commercial.

08:48.782 --> 08:49.783
Mm‐hmm.

08:53.620 --> 08:54.955
Look at them.

08:55.021 --> 08:57.891
Trying to make us think
they're dating other people

08:57.958 --> 09:00.100
by dating other people.

09:01.568 --> 09:02.969
Yeah, poor Kyle.

09:03.036 --> 09:06.239
Wasting his whole night
on a Miss USA look alike

09:06.306 --> 09:09.109
just so he could throw
salt in your game.

09:09.175 --> 09:10.544
Alright. But what about Max?

09:10.611 --> 09:12.445
(Regine)
'I mean, why did she rummage
to the bottom'

09:12.513 --> 09:16.683
'of your reject pile
to find Wooden Boy?'

09:16.750 --> 09:18.484
[chuckles]

09:18.552 --> 09:20.654
You know, Regine,
if you got paid for the time

09:20.721 --> 09:22.756
you spend in
other people's business

09:22.823 --> 09:24.424
you would afford
your own apartment.

09:25.726 --> 09:27.928
Let's work on that.

09:27.994 --> 09:30.030
Lilah, try some
of this egg foo yung.

09:30.096 --> 09:33.133
Oh, Clinton, take that
off my plate, please.

09:33.199 --> 09:34.868
You never try anything new.

09:34.935 --> 09:36.202
By the time
you got off enough guts

09:36.269 --> 09:38.104
to try a new course,
it was gone.

09:38.171 --> 09:40.240
Why don't you eat it for me?

09:40.306 --> 09:41.542
With your mouth full
it might muffle

09:41.608 --> 09:43.209
some of that nonsense
I'm hearing.

09:46.212 --> 09:48.849
Yeah, you, you all talk
about some good television.

09:48.915 --> 09:51.952
Who saw "When animals attack"?

09:52.018 --> 09:53.353
Ri‐right.

09:53.419 --> 09:55.556
Whe‐whe‐when that deer
was beating on that man.

09:55.622 --> 09:57.991
And it was just clubbing
him down with hooves.

09:58.058 --> 10:00.493
‐ Yeah, literally.
‐ Congratulations, Lilah.

10:00.561 --> 10:03.704
You brought a joyous gathering
to a screeching halt.

10:03.770 --> 10:07.307
Look like somebody ordered up
some ugly in here.

10:07.373 --> 10:08.775
I'm not the one
who's been forcing

10:08.842 --> 10:10.476
those stupid jokes on everyone.

10:10.544 --> 10:13.346
Lord knows,
I don't miss that.

10:13.413 --> 10:14.748
Oh, and I don't miss
your lectures on that

10:14.815 --> 10:17.584
ab‐roller gathering dust
in the corner.

10:17.651 --> 10:20.821
Hey, w‐what's going on?

10:20.887 --> 10:23.189
Go ahead. Tell her, Clinton.
She has a right to know.

10:23.256 --> 10:24.925
Your father and I are separated.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.528
What?

10:32.398 --> 10:34.000
Separated?

10:34.067 --> 10:36.570
Bu‐but you all..
You two look so together.

10:36.637 --> 10:38.238
I'm sorry, baby.

10:38.304 --> 10:40.440
We were going to tell
you after your wedding.

10:40.507 --> 10:41.441
Well, how sweet.

10:41.508 --> 10:42.576
Why, why give crystal

10:42.643 --> 10:44.444
when a divorce
is so much more permanent?

10:45.579 --> 10:46.947
Otis, honey, why don't we go

10:47.013 --> 10:48.782
look at the beer Buddha
over there?

10:48.849 --> 10:50.884
Uh, if we can see the
beer Buddha from here

10:50.951 --> 10:53.319
why we gotta go over there?

10:53.386 --> 10:57.824
Otis, I put up with
600 miles of your driving.

10:57.891 --> 11:00.867
You could at least
walk 12 feet with me.

11:03.504 --> 11:04.571
'Come on.'

11:04.638 --> 11:08.542
Son, I gotta go look
at the beer Buddha.

11:08.609 --> 11:09.810
And so do you.

11:10.944 --> 11:12.312
Just delight us, come on.

11:14.114 --> 11:15.616
What's going on
with you two?

11:16.917 --> 11:18.284
Yeah, you guys always used to

11:18.351 --> 11:19.986
seem like the perfect couple.

11:20.053 --> 11:22.188
All kissy, kissy and stuff.

11:22.255 --> 11:24.490
Slow dancin' when
there wasn't any music.

11:25.225 --> 11:26.426
And that was in church.

11:27.493 --> 11:28.795
That was 20 years ago.

11:28.862 --> 11:30.063
People change.

11:30.130 --> 11:31.898
But they can change together.

11:31.965 --> 11:34.868
Uh, look at Demi and Bruce.
They both went bald. I mean..

11:38.304 --> 11:41.041
Your mother
just tunes me out.

11:41.107 --> 11:43.710
[sighing]
That's right, Clinton.

11:43.777 --> 11:45.378
It's all my fault.

11:45.445 --> 11:47.948
I'm the one who never listens.
Excuse me!

11:48.014 --> 11:49.249
‐ See?
‐ Mom, don't go.

11:49.315 --> 11:52.452
I opened my mouth, poof!
She's the Invisible Woman.

11:52.519 --> 11:54.921
Well, two can play that game.

11:54.988 --> 11:57.490
‐ Well, daddy, don't go.
‐ Uncle Clinton, Uncle Clinton.

12:00.393 --> 12:02.168
[gasps]
I, uh..

12:02.235 --> 12:04.037
The only argument
they ever had was

12:04.104 --> 12:05.171
over who loved who more.

12:05.238 --> 12:07.007
What is this?

12:07.073 --> 12:09.342
Oh, they're still in love.

12:09.409 --> 12:11.778
I'm sure they'll
figure this all out.

12:11.845 --> 12:14.515
Yeah, well,
your parents didn't.

12:14.581 --> 12:16.282
Well, that's because
my parents tended to fight

12:16.349 --> 12:18.318
over my father
forgetting to come home.

12:21.054 --> 12:22.823
Wish there was
something I could do.

12:22.889 --> 12:24.958
Son, this is one of them times

12:25.025 --> 12:28.962
when you gotta let
the beaver build its own dam.

12:29.029 --> 12:31.732
I mean, why would they
pick a time like this

12:31.798 --> 12:34.167
to drop a big old bomb
like that?

12:34.234 --> 12:37.237
‐ What's up with that?
‐ Yeah!

12:37.303 --> 12:39.439
You don't hear me
talking about my bunions.

12:40.674 --> 12:42.509
And they deserve
some conversation.

12:44.144 --> 12:46.980
My memories go back
way before second grade.

12:47.047 --> 12:50.551
My very first memory
was of lying in my crib.

12:50.617 --> 12:53.019
Just, just,
just lying there

12:53.086 --> 12:55.822
not, not really awake

12:55.889 --> 12:58.191
not really sleeping.

12:59.893 --> 13:02.002
I can relate.

13:02.068 --> 13:05.305
Mm... Half of my shampoo models,
they don't have hair

13:05.371 --> 13:06.907
as lush as yours.

13:06.973 --> 13:08.675
Uh, you know, a little genetics

13:08.742 --> 13:10.911
a little Fro‐So Soft. Yeah.

13:10.977 --> 13:12.713
[laughs]

13:12.779 --> 13:13.947
Give me your hair.

13:16.482 --> 13:18.184
Ooh, baby, that's hair.

13:20.220 --> 13:21.855
Oh, now, careful.

13:21.922 --> 13:22.889
You know my hair

13:22.956 --> 13:25.826
is one of my many
erogenous zones.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.027
Ow!

13:28.328 --> 13:30.363
You can take it, big baby.

13:30.430 --> 13:32.365
‐ Oh, yeah.
‐ Duh, enough!

13:32.432 --> 13:34.367
Kyle, if you can
tear yourself away

13:34.434 --> 13:36.169
from lady fingers there

13:36.236 --> 13:37.738
I'd like to talk to you.

13:37.804 --> 13:40.440
Well, you keep those
ten digits warm, okay?

13:45.111 --> 13:46.547
Ey, where are they going?

13:46.613 --> 13:48.148
Who, who,
who is this leggy chick?

13:48.214 --> 13:49.149
Is Max paying you?

13:49.215 --> 13:51.317
Come on, man!
I want answers!

13:52.653 --> 13:53.687
My head hurts.

13:56.823 --> 13:58.424
Alright, so what's
the deal, Barker?

13:58.491 --> 14:01.467
What you're trying to prove,
flying in that floozy?

14:01.535 --> 14:03.504
Maxine, bringing dates
was your idea.

14:03.570 --> 14:06.039
And as your escort proves,
New York's dating pool is

14:06.106 --> 14:09.342
at the moment,
frighteningly shallow.

14:09.409 --> 14:11.878
Admit it, you imported
that chocolate cake

14:11.945 --> 14:13.279
to make me jealous.

14:14.881 --> 14:17.483
I will neither confirm
nor deny that.

14:17.551 --> 14:19.586
But the fact that you are
green with jealousy

14:19.653 --> 14:20.754
does make me kind of giddy.

14:20.821 --> 14:21.922
[sniggers]

14:21.988 --> 14:23.757
I am not jealous.

14:25.258 --> 14:26.593
It just burns me
the freak up

14:26.660 --> 14:28.061
to see you with that woman.

14:29.530 --> 14:31.064
Now, Maxine,
you say that again

14:31.131 --> 14:32.933
and listen to yourself.

14:32.999 --> 14:35.969
Admit it. You like me.

14:37.938 --> 14:39.840
Not as much as
you like yourself.

14:40.707 --> 14:41.875
Well, that's a start.

14:41.942 --> 14:43.276
[chuckles]

14:43.343 --> 14:45.846
Mm, Kyle, I mean

14:45.912 --> 14:49.415
what good it would do
to admit such a thing?

14:49.482 --> 14:50.884
Because, then I wouldn't see you

14:50.951 --> 14:54.287
as the troll
under the bridge of truth.

14:54.354 --> 14:57.157
More like the brave Billy Goat
walking across it.

14:58.424 --> 15:02.468
Come on, Maxine.
Unburden your soul.

15:02.536 --> 15:05.238
‐ Rrrrr.
‐ Alright, shut up.

15:05.305 --> 15:08.742
All these years
of on again, off again

15:08.809 --> 15:10.176
and sticking around,
you've grown on me.

15:10.243 --> 15:12.546
And in some ways,
a lot of ways, you're my equal.

15:12.613 --> 15:14.815
And although I'm not entirely
comfortable with that

15:14.881 --> 15:15.849
that's just who I am.

15:15.916 --> 15:17.483
There!

15:17.551 --> 15:19.285
I said it.

15:19.352 --> 15:20.921
And that was quite an admission.

15:20.987 --> 15:22.556
I just wish
I knew what it meant.

15:24.190 --> 15:25.158
Oh, hell, man.

15:26.426 --> 15:27.861
I like you.

15:30.797 --> 15:34.100
Yes, yes, yes, yes.

15:34.167 --> 15:37.403
Uh, Maxine.
Now, was that so hard?

15:37.470 --> 15:40.874
Darling, come here.
Yeah.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.543
‐ It's true.
‐ Mm‐hmm.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.711
‐ I like you.
‐ Mm.

15:46.513 --> 15:48.815
And sometimes I think I‐‐

15:48.882 --> 15:49.883
[screams]

15:49.950 --> 15:51.985
And get the hell
away from me!

15:58.559 --> 15:59.660
I hate that woman.

16:10.176 --> 16:12.112
Hey, baby. How you doin'?

16:14.080 --> 16:15.015
Obie..

16:15.081 --> 16:17.618
Oh.

16:17.684 --> 16:20.153
If my parent's marriage
can break up, anybody's can.

16:20.220 --> 16:21.588
Even ours.

16:21.655 --> 16:22.789
What's the point of
jumping the broom

16:22.856 --> 16:26.359
if it's just gonna
end up like this?

16:26.426 --> 16:27.694
That's it.

16:29.596 --> 16:32.866
All James' report
to the foyer, immediately!

16:32.933 --> 16:35.301
I'm mopping up this mess
right here and right now.

16:35.368 --> 16:36.302
‐ You hear me?
‐ What are you gonna do?

16:36.369 --> 16:38.171
No, you'll see. You‐‐

16:38.238 --> 16:40.206
Did you say "Jones'" pumpkin?

16:40.273 --> 16:42.576
‐ No, mama, I said James'.
‐ Oh.

16:42.643 --> 16:43.910
We're going
to have a little meeting.

16:43.977 --> 16:45.111
And if it's about
the two bucks

16:45.178 --> 16:47.581
for the cool check,
it's about time.

16:50.517 --> 16:52.653
Overton, if this is about
Mrs. James and me

16:52.719 --> 16:54.621
this is between
Mrs. James and me.

16:54.688 --> 16:56.089
No, this is not about you.

16:56.156 --> 16:58.224
My girl is having
doubts about us now.

16:58.291 --> 17:00.360
Honey, it's perfectly natural
to have second thoughts.

17:00.426 --> 17:02.402
Lord knows I should have.

17:02.468 --> 17:05.571
Oh, look who found
her funny bone.

17:05.638 --> 17:07.107
Wait a minute, Synclaire.
You're not having doubts

17:07.173 --> 17:09.843
because of what's going
on between them, are you?

17:09.910 --> 17:12.613
Don't put words
in my mouth, but yes.

17:12.679 --> 17:14.681
Oh, fool, if you
follow that logic

17:14.748 --> 17:16.717
you'll never get married.

17:16.782 --> 17:19.319
I mean, most marriages
end in divorce.

17:21.755 --> 17:23.056
I'm not helping, am I?

17:24.724 --> 17:26.560
I'm just gonna go over here.

17:26.627 --> 17:29.129
Honey, Overton is a sweet

17:29.195 --> 17:30.697
considerate man
who respects you.

17:30.764 --> 17:31.932
He is not a wind bag

17:31.998 --> 17:34.134
who turns everything
you say into a joke.

17:34.200 --> 17:36.603
Well, and you're not
marrying some killjoy

17:36.670 --> 17:39.973
who talks about you
like you're not in the room.

17:40.040 --> 17:42.442
I don't ever remember you two
going at each other like this.

17:42.509 --> 17:44.511
Wha‐what happened?

17:44.578 --> 17:46.913
Well, you moved to New York.

17:46.980 --> 17:48.882
Few years later,
I stopped teaching.

17:48.949 --> 17:50.150
And very shortly after that

17:50.216 --> 17:53.219
I realized how annoying
your father is.

17:53.286 --> 17:56.122
Your mother just doesn't
appreciate my sense of humor.

17:56.189 --> 17:58.825
No, what I don't appreciate
is having to keep what I want

17:58.892 --> 18:00.026
out of life to myself because

18:00.093 --> 18:02.168
you'll turn
it into a great big joke.

18:02.235 --> 18:03.169
Come here, baby.

18:03.236 --> 18:05.138
See, see, we're not like them.

18:05.205 --> 18:06.907
I'd never make
fun of your dreams.

18:06.973 --> 18:09.042
Did I scoff when you did
that naked play?

18:09.109 --> 18:10.043
‐ What?
‐ What?

18:10.110 --> 18:13.446
No! Now, zippity,
yoo‐hay, now.

18:13.514 --> 18:14.447
Zip.

18:14.515 --> 18:16.049
Stay on the subject here.

18:17.150 --> 18:19.319
Ma, you tell daddy

18:19.385 --> 18:20.921
what it is you wanna do.

18:20.987 --> 18:22.388
He'll laugh.

18:22.455 --> 18:24.691
Hmm. Hey, at least one of us
will feel better.

18:25.391 --> 18:27.360
Dad!

18:27.427 --> 18:29.095
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

18:30.096 --> 18:31.097
Okay, Lilah.

18:32.666 --> 18:34.034
I am listening.

18:37.270 --> 18:41.742
I want to be a lounge singer.

18:41.808 --> 18:43.644
[laughs]

18:43.710 --> 18:45.211
'Did you hear that?'

18:45.278 --> 18:47.247
[coughs]

18:47.313 --> 18:49.683
[indistinct]

18:49.750 --> 18:52.452
A lounge singer. You mean, like
John Davidson at the Ramada.

18:52.519 --> 18:53.587
Eventually.

18:53.654 --> 18:55.589
I mean, you know,
I have to start small.

18:55.656 --> 18:58.759
Uh, mini malls and‐and open mike
nights and church basements.

18:58.825 --> 19:01.768
I remember when you sang
at grandpa Jerry's funeral.

19:01.835 --> 19:03.537
Oh, there wasn't a
dry eye in the house.

19:03.604 --> 19:06.272
Baby, that's probably 'cause,
uh, Jerry was dead.

19:08.341 --> 19:10.677
If singing is your dream,
I'll support you.

19:10.744 --> 19:13.313
Even if it is
a little bit loony.

19:13.379 --> 19:14.515
Maybe, I'll put
a few jokes together

19:14.581 --> 19:15.716
and be your opening act.

19:15.782 --> 19:17.684
That's not part of the dream.

19:17.751 --> 19:21.387
So, can we consider
this crisis solved?

19:21.454 --> 19:22.556
Well, I don't think so.

19:22.623 --> 19:24.558
We have a lot
more talking to do.

19:24.625 --> 19:25.892
I'm willing.

19:25.959 --> 19:28.294
And I promise
I won't say anything funny.

19:28.361 --> 19:29.830
Don't I know it.

19:31.064 --> 19:33.634
Oh, that's a step
in the right direction.

19:33.700 --> 19:37.170
Look at that, look at that.
Mummy, daddy. Mummy, daddy.

19:37.237 --> 19:38.872
Aww.

19:38.939 --> 19:41.441
Mother, would you like
to sing at our wedding?

19:43.009 --> 19:45.646
Oh, I get to wear
my Paddy Lavelle wig.

19:45.712 --> 19:47.447
Oh, my God.

19:47.514 --> 19:49.650
