00:02.335 --> 00:04.921
This season, 16 tattoo artists

00:05.004 --> 00:07.924
descended on New York City
for a cutthroat tattoo showdown.

00:08.007 --> 00:11.886
They designed and applied
161 tattoos,

00:11.970 --> 00:14.222
and we are down
to three finalists.

00:14.305 --> 00:17.100
Only one will walk away
with $100,000,

00:17.183 --> 00:18.893
a feature in <i> Inked</i> magazine,

00:18.977 --> 00:22.313
and most importantly,
the coveted title of Ink Master.

00:22.397 --> 00:24.983
Each week,
you voted, America,

00:25.066 --> 00:27.944
and tonight, your vote will help
determine the winner.

00:28.027 --> 00:29.612
It's all happening right now

00:29.696 --> 00:32.448
on the first ever
<i>Ink Master Live.</i>

<i>This season on</i> Ink Master,

00:40.457 --> 00:44.627
16 of the best tattoo artists
have been battling it out

00:44.711 --> 00:46.755
to determine
who's number one.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.465
Oh, man.

00:48.548 --> 00:49.632
She's got some problems.

00:49.716 --> 00:50.717
Seriously,
I'm gonna crap my pants.

00:50.800 --> 00:53.678
Did she misspell
"Corinthians?"

00:53.762 --> 00:56.222
Oh, my god.
Sound it out phonetically.

00:56.306 --> 00:58.016
Cor--

00:58.099 --> 00:58.975
[narrator] <i> Their skills</i>

<i>Ingenuity.</i>

01:04.647 --> 01:06.024
My wife is gonna be
pi-i-issed!

01:06.107 --> 01:09.486
A strong artist
is gonna go home all the time.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.488
I'm prettier than you, baby.
I'm flier than you.

01:11.571 --> 01:12.781
You're lucky
girl can't spell,

01:12.864 --> 01:13.782
'cause they would have
shipped your ass out already.

01:13.865 --> 01:14.991
[narrator] <i> Lines.</i>

01:15.074 --> 01:15.700
It's not
"create your own [bleep]" day.

01:15.784 --> 01:19.037
You can't do
a simple tattoo,

01:19.120 --> 01:21.790
how can you ever
do a complex tattoo?

01:21.873 --> 01:23.541
{\an5}-[narrator] <i> Color.</i>

01:21.873 --> 01:23.541
-You're going down.

01:23.625 --> 01:24.918
You better be able
to back that [bleep] up.

01:25.001 --> 01:27.003
What's coming
out of the heart?

01:27.086 --> 01:28.046
{\an5}-Smoke.

01:27.086 --> 01:28.046
-Smoke?

01:28.129 --> 01:30.298
We really think
it looks like a used tissue.

01:30.381 --> 01:31.174
{\an5}-[laughs]

01:30.381 --> 01:31.174
-[narrator] <i> Texture.</i>

01:31.257 --> 01:35.011
You must tattoo
the inside of the mouth.

01:35.094 --> 01:37.889
[Moaning and grunting from pain]

01:37.972 --> 01:39.516
This is the last time
I'm gonna say this [bleep].

01:39.599 --> 01:41.518
I play mind games
like a mother[bleep].

01:41.601 --> 01:42.393
{\an5}-You're weak.

01:41.601 --> 01:42.393
-Okay.

01:42.477 --> 01:43.353
You're definitely weak.
Look at you.

{\an5}-[narrator] <i> Gradation.</i>

01:43.436 --> 01:45.980

01:46.064 --> 01:49.526
{\an5}-[laughing] Ooh, yeah!

01:46.064 --> 01:49.526
-Mark, you are not

01:49.609 --> 01:51.236
to the level
of a lot of people here.

01:51.319 --> 01:52.570
So you shouldn't be speaking
about anything.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.614
[narrator] <i> Dimension.</i>

01:54.697 --> 01:56.699
Does anybody wanna
[bleep] win this thing?

01:56.783 --> 01:59.369
How far outside of the box
do you expect us to go?

01:59.452 --> 02:00.829
It's gotta get better.

02:00.912 --> 02:02.413
I don't think my drawing
was that bad.

02:02.497 --> 02:04.207
If you sucked,
why can't I point it out?

02:04.290 --> 02:05.500
I don't give a [bleep] rat's ass
about your feelings

[narrator]
<i>Attention to detail.</i>

02:09.211 --> 02:10.128
Look at this hand!

02:10.213 --> 02:12.507
I can't say that
that hand is [bleep] up.

02:12.590 --> 02:15.051
If you look at that hand, and
don't think it looks [bleep],

02:15.134 --> 02:16.678
there is
our major problem.

02:16.761 --> 02:17.512
[narrator]
<i>And precision.</i>

02:17.595 --> 02:18.805
I didn't change
the [bleep] face.

02:18.888 --> 02:20.723
That [bleep] is horrible.

02:20.807 --> 02:22.934
My portrait obviously sucks,

02:23.017 --> 02:24.894
but this is
Sebastian's strong suit.

02:24.978 --> 02:27.105
Get the [bleep] out of here.

02:27.188 --> 02:31.442

the <i> Ink Master</i> finale,

03:06.227 --> 03:07.353
live, in New York City.

03:07.437 --> 03:11.232
As always, I'm joined
by two legends in the business:

03:11.316 --> 03:14.944
My fellow judges,
Oliver Peck and Chris Nunez.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.780
In a bit, we'll bring out
our three finalists.

03:17.864 --> 03:20.116
We will critique
their 24-hour tattoos

03:20.199 --> 03:22.869
and determine the winner,
but first,

03:22.952 --> 03:26.039
there are 13 other
amazingly skilled tattoo artists

03:26.122 --> 03:27.665
who competed this season.

03:27.749 --> 03:29.834
They learned when-- when it
comes to being an <i> Ink Master</i> ,

03:29.918 --> 03:32.003
there is no room for error.

03:32.086 --> 03:34.297
One by one,
they were eliminated,

03:34.380 --> 03:37.842
but they're all here tonight,
so let's bring 'em out.

How you all doing?

04:24.180 --> 04:25.181
{\an5}-[affirmative responses]

04:24.180 --> 04:25.181
{\an3}-Good.

04:25.264 --> 04:27.183
Let's get started
with a few questions.

04:27.266 --> 04:30.478
Tatu Baby,
you just got eliminated.

04:30.561 --> 04:33.856
{\an8}How does it feel to have come
so close to the final three?

04:33.940 --> 04:37.193
Um, it feels like...

04:37.902 --> 04:40.321
{\an5}-Oh, sorry.

04:37.902 --> 04:40.321
-[laughs]

04:40.405 --> 04:41.197
It feels like
I'm feeling

04:41.281 --> 04:43.282
the whole painful moment
all over again,

04:43.366 --> 04:47.120
{\an8}like I just relived it,
and I feel like

04:47.203 --> 04:49.372
{\an8}I just ran a 13 mile race

04:49.455 --> 04:52.667
{\an8}and I beat
all my other contestants

04:52.750 --> 04:54.877
{\an8}and right when I had my
hands on the finish line,

04:54.961 --> 04:58.131
I trip and I fall, and it's
nobody else's fault but mine.

04:58.214 --> 05:03.469
I feel like
my tattoo had its, um... Sorry.

05:03.553 --> 05:08.057
My tattoo had its, um...
[Indistinct]

05:09.183 --> 05:11.894
Had its--
had stuff wrong with it, but--

05:11.978 --> 05:13.896
[laughter]

05:13.980 --> 05:15.523
But I don't think
that it was the worst.

05:15.606 --> 05:17.442
Okay. Well, it's good
to see you again.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.276
{\an5}-Likewise.

05:17.525 --> 05:18.276
-You look beautiful tonight.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.361
{\an5}-Thank you.

05:18.359 --> 05:20.361
-Jamie, let's, uh,

05:20.445 --> 05:22.947
let's go to you. One of
the most controversial issues

05:23.031 --> 05:25.158
this season
was your lack of tattoos.

05:25.241 --> 05:27.827
Do you have anything
to say to that?

05:27.910 --> 05:29.412
{\an8}Um, just, you know,
I obviously don't care

05:29.495 --> 05:32.457
{\an8}what other people think
about the personal decisions

05:32.540 --> 05:33.791
{\an8}that I make with my body.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.878
Um, you know, it's really nobody
else's business but my own,

05:36.961 --> 05:40.089
and, you know, it's--
it's really up to me.

05:40.173 --> 05:42.091
I think that if, you know,
if you guys are happy

05:42.175 --> 05:45.136
with having bad tattoos,
then that's-- I'm glad for you.

05:45.219 --> 05:46.387
{\an5}-[laughter]

05:45.219 --> 05:46.387
-You know?

05:46.471 --> 05:48.014
You're stuck with them,
but I wouldn't be, so--

05:48.097 --> 05:51.809
[laughter, cheers, and applause]

05:51.893 --> 05:56.606
{\an8}I got-- you know, I've actually
got an offer for Oliver.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.608
{\an8}You let me shave off
your hair and moustache,

05:58.691 --> 06:00.026
{\an8}I'll let you put a tattoo
on me somewhere I can't hide it.

06:00.109 --> 06:02.445
{\an8}-[audience jeers]

06:00.109 --> 06:02.445
{\an8}-Hello!

06:02.528 --> 06:05.198
{\an8}-[laughs]

06:02.528 --> 06:05.198
{\an8}-Whoa!

06:05.281 --> 06:07.408
Those are fighting words,
my friend.

06:07.492 --> 06:09.077
{\an5}-Wow!

06:07.492 --> 06:09.077
-Oliver,

06:09.160 --> 06:11.954
{\an5}-anything for Jamie?

06:09.160 --> 06:11.954
-Well, first of all,

06:12.038 --> 06:13.331
{\an5}-I'd just like--

06:12.038 --> 06:13.331
-[outburst from the audience]

06:13.414 --> 06:14.582
Yeah, live.

06:14.665 --> 06:17.543
I'd just like to say that
the fact that you got eliminated

06:17.627 --> 06:21.047
did not have anything to do with
the fact you don't have tattoos.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.591
The fact that that came up
on the same episode,

06:23.674 --> 06:25.218
that's the way it is,
you know.

06:25.301 --> 06:27.887
We obviously
have strong opinions

06:27.970 --> 06:29.806
about the tattoo industry,
and what we feel is right

06:29.889 --> 06:31.849
and what is wrong. Um...

06:33.184 --> 06:35.311
And we made our decisions
on what we judged,

06:35.394 --> 06:38.606
and that was it. I stand by
my decision 100 percent,

06:38.689 --> 06:39.440
and, uh...

06:41.442 --> 06:42.485
{\an5}-I'm not mad at you.

06:41.442 --> 06:42.485
-I don't know if you--

06:42.568 --> 06:44.529
I don't even know
if you deserve a tattoo.

06:44.612 --> 06:46.572
{\an5}-Ohh!

06:44.612 --> 06:46.572
-[audience oohs]

06:47.657 --> 06:49.408
Well, you still deserve
a haircut!

06:49.492 --> 06:51.452
{\an5}-Wow!

06:49.492 --> 06:51.452
-Hey, man, let me step in.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.454
{\an5}-Chris, chime in, yeah.

06:51.536 --> 06:53.454
-I'm gonna tell ya

06:53.538 --> 06:57.125
that I was on your team,
I was on your side,

06:57.208 --> 06:59.502
and I was a big fan
of the tattoos you had done

06:59.585 --> 07:02.213
up until that point,
and honestly,

07:02.296 --> 07:04.048
I said it then
and I'll say it now,

07:04.132 --> 07:06.050
that I feel like,
if you would have come

07:06.134 --> 07:08.136
and you would have brought
your gamesmanship

07:08.219 --> 07:11.222
to that particular episode,
you may have found yourself

07:11.305 --> 07:13.850
in this finale,
and the whole controversy

07:13.933 --> 07:16.978
surrounding your tattoos,
or tattoo-less body,

07:17.061 --> 07:18.437
has nothing to do
with the fact that

07:18.521 --> 07:19.313
if you would have
made it to this finale,

07:19.397 --> 07:21.899
we wouldn't be talking
about this.

07:21.983 --> 07:24.068
We'd be talking about
you being in the finale,

07:24.152 --> 07:26.320
and you wouldn't be standing
up here with these guys.

07:26.404 --> 07:27.989
That particular day, you used

07:28.072 --> 07:29.949
your shader instead
of your liner,

07:30.032 --> 07:31.868
and you should have used
your liner.

07:31.951 --> 07:32.785
{\an5}-Oh, no, I agree.

07:31.951 --> 07:32.785
-Outright.

07:32.869 --> 07:33.703
I should have been
in the bottom.

07:33.786 --> 07:34.871
I earned
my trip to the bottom,

07:34.954 --> 07:36.330
I just thought that,
you know,

07:36.414 --> 07:37.498
when you're in a critique,
that really wasn't the time

07:37.582 --> 07:39.917
{\an5}-to bring it up.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.917
-Well, I mean, it's--

07:40.001 --> 07:41.210
you guys--if you guys
hadn't have brought it up,

07:41.294 --> 07:42.253
I wouldn't have done
the sleeves.

07:42.336 --> 07:43.462
It's the elephant
in the room, though.

07:43.546 --> 07:44.547
If I wouldn't have done
the sleeves,

07:44.630 --> 07:45.840
Forrest
wouldn't have got pissed,

07:45.923 --> 07:46.757
and that would have--
it could have been a difference.

07:46.841 --> 07:48.050
Listen, it's the elephant
in the room

07:48.134 --> 07:50.219
{\an5}-and I think we all know.

07:48.134 --> 07:50.219
-We gotta move it along, Chris.

07:50.303 --> 07:52.221
Hey, Jamie, thanks
for having it out with us.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.931
{\an5}-Clint.

07:52.305 --> 07:53.931
-What's up, buddy?

07:54.015 --> 07:56.058
You seemed pretty confident
all season.

07:56.142 --> 07:57.643
Do you think that you're better
than the final three?

07:59.520 --> 08:00.563
No, I don't think
I'm better,

08:00.646 --> 08:02.899
{\an8}but I know
I'm just as good as they are.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.484
{\an8}As a matter of fact,
I'm from Dallas,

08:05.568 --> 08:07.195
same place you are,

08:07.278 --> 08:09.572
and I've tattooed in your
shadow for almost 20 years.

08:09.655 --> 08:12.074
{\an5}-I'd be willing to test--

a second chance at this,

I'd be up here
in the finale right now.

I'm that confident.

you should say that,

for you guys.

Each week, millions of viewers

{\an8}Up next,
the human canvases.

09:06.045 --> 09:09.257
{\an8}Each week, our human canvases
put their skin on the line,

09:09.340 --> 09:10.967
hoping for great art.

09:11.050 --> 09:14.428
Most left thrilled,
but some left pissed.

09:14.512 --> 09:15.930
Now, for the first time,

09:16.013 --> 09:18.557
they will confront their artist
face-to-face.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.184

permanently Mark their bodies.

not going to work,

11:53.087 --> 11:54.588
So Nick was your artist,

11:54.672 --> 11:57.466
and you weren't all too pleased
with his new school tattoo.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.094
How do you feel
about it now?

12:00.177 --> 12:02.096
{\an8}The only thing I like
about the tattoo

12:02.179 --> 12:03.556
{\an8}is the fact
that it's on my back

12:03.639 --> 12:05.182

every day.

12:08.227 --> 12:12.148
Nick was so immature,
and when the episode aired,

12:12.231 --> 12:14.358
and I saw the episode
and the fact

12:14.442 --> 12:16.444
that he was insulting
all my other ink--

12:16.527 --> 12:17.445
first of all,
he said that his piece

12:17.528 --> 12:19.447
was the best
on my body.

It <i> was</i> the best
on your body.

you said that in your interview.

{\an8}Dave even agreed with that.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.703

{\an8}What does that mean,

12:39.300 --> 12:40.593
You gotta think about it
this way,

12:40.676 --> 12:42.845
like, I'm 22 years old and
I made it on this competition.

12:42.928 --> 12:44.805
I would have went way further
if I didn't hit you.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.307
{\an5}-Yeah--

12:44.889 --> 12:46.307

12:46.390 --> 12:49.101

your bad artistic vision,

I got sent home!

If you had stayed,

12:54.273 --> 12:56.317
you would have done another
jacked tattoo on another canvas.

my favorite day, the pinup day.

13:20.799 --> 13:23.344
{\an5}-Yeah, mine too.

13:20.799 --> 13:23.344
-How do you feel

13:23.427 --> 13:24.553
about the pinup
that Mark gave you?

13:24.637 --> 13:26.722
I gotta tell you, when he
first came out with the drawing,

13:26.805 --> 13:27.973
I was a little skeptical,
and then he--

13:28.057 --> 13:30.059
he put it on my body
and I went into the bathroom

13:30.142 --> 13:32.895
after he-- I looked at it,
I was like, "I don't know,"

13:32.978 --> 13:34.855
{\an8}you know, "let me give him
the benefit of the doubt,"

13:34.939 --> 13:36.941
{\an8}and then I started--
I got out to smoke a cigarette,

13:37.024 --> 13:38.150
and I looked at it again,
and I was like,

13:38.234 --> 13:39.693
"man, it's really, really dark,"

13:39.777 --> 13:41.987
you know what I mean,
and I get home,

13:42.071 --> 13:43.822
and I'm looking at it
in the mirror,

13:43.906 --> 13:46.242
and my old lady's like,
"bro, what's up with--

13:46.325 --> 13:48.244
"that's not an '80s chick
rolling out of a club.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.119
It looks like--
forget about it,"

13:49.203 --> 13:50.579
and I'm like,
"I know, it's really--"

13:50.663 --> 13:51.830
{\an8}well, it looks like
she <i> is</i> 80.

13:51.914 --> 13:53.249
{\an8}I mean, if that's
any consolation.

13:53.332 --> 13:54.708
{\an8}She-- she looks like
she's rolling out of a different

13:54.792 --> 13:56.961
{\an8}part of New York City at
that particular moment in time,

13:57.044 --> 13:59.088
{\an8}let me tell you,
and it's so dark.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.215
{\an8}Mark, so you say--
you say to Bradley, Mark?

14:01.298 --> 14:02.299
{\an8}Yeah, I mean, first of
all, off the top, man,

14:02.383 --> 14:05.010

and get in an ego battle.

14:05.094 --> 14:06.262
You're right.
Not only was that

14:06.345 --> 14:08.222
{\an8}the worst tattoo
I did on the competition,

14:08.305 --> 14:11.100
that's probably the worst tattoo
I've done in a year or two.

14:11.183 --> 14:13.269

I came into this tattoo

14:13.352 --> 14:14.603
with a broken thumb
on my tattoo hand,

because I'm also
an M.M.A. Fighter.

I broke my hand a few weeks
before coming onto the show.

14:19.191 --> 14:21.902
I tattooed with it.
Your tattoo was the first tattoo

14:21.986 --> 14:23.779

was aggravated for.

14:28.367 --> 14:29.910

14:28.367 --> 14:29.910
-It's no fault of your own,

anything that I could do--

Tommy, what's your plan?

15:10.367 --> 15:11.452
Well, I kinda did.

15:11.535 --> 15:12.995
Let's see it first.
I don't know if, uh...

15:13.078 --> 15:14.788
[laughter]
I don't know how bad it is,

15:14.872 --> 15:16.624
but no, I'm excited
to work with you, Bradley.

15:16.707 --> 15:17.708
I'm excited
to work with you too, bro.

15:17.791 --> 15:19.251
I'm not here to bash
any artist.

15:19.335 --> 15:20.586

15:19.335 --> 15:20.586
-No, not at all, man.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.338
Well, besides that,
I'm not here to bash artists,

15:22.421 --> 15:26.008
I'm not here to bash
the collector at all, ever,

15:26.091 --> 15:27.760
but, you know, the guys
from <i> Tattoo Nightmares,</i>

15:27.843 --> 15:28.677
we decided that, you know,
maybe we could do something

15:28.761 --> 15:30.929
for Bradley
and help him out.

15:31.013 --> 15:32.640
I love you for that, bro,
I really mean that.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.099
What was that?
Yeah, you don't know me yet,

15:34.183 --> 15:35.351
{\an5}-so we'll see how that goes.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.351
-Hopefully, we got enough

15:35.434 --> 15:36.602
{\an5}-colored ink.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.602
-I'm excited, bro, I'm excited.

15:36.685 --> 15:38.187
Hopefully, we have
enough colored ink for it.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.355
[laughter]

15:39.438 --> 15:40.689
{\an5}-I'm excited.

15:39.438 --> 15:40.689
-And Jasmine will be happy

15:40.773 --> 15:41.482
to cover the one that
Tommy does, so you're covered.

15:41.565 --> 15:43.692

-All right, thank you, man.

Time is running out to pick
the artist you think

{\an8}Now, the reason
we're all here tonight.

17:00.352 --> 17:01.895
{\an8}They fought hard
all season long,

17:01.979 --> 17:04.940
{\an8}and some produced
some mind-blowing tattoos.

17:05.022 --> 17:06.942
One of them will be named
<i>Ink Master</i> .

17:07.025 --> 17:09.611
Let's see how the finalists
got here.

17:11.905 --> 17:13.781
I really like color realism.

17:13.866 --> 17:16.492
It's taking a painting and
putting it on someone's skin.

17:16.577 --> 17:18.119
Dude, this little
Jack-in-the-box down here

17:18.203 --> 17:20.289
with a spring coming up.
[Bleep], yeah!

17:20.372 --> 17:21.957
Once I pick up
that tattoo machine,

17:22.040 --> 17:23.584
{\an8}the competition's
getting a shut down.

17:23.666 --> 17:25.210
Sarah, you don't do well
under pressure.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.421
You get frustrated,
you throw tantrums.

17:27.503 --> 17:29.298
You're a [bleep] dick!

17:30.174 --> 17:30.799
Pressure! Pressure!

17:30.883 --> 17:32.968
I'm a really good artist.

17:33.051 --> 17:35.262
I'm not done.
Don't count me out.

17:35.345 --> 17:39.933
Last night, I cried,
I moped around a little bit,

17:40.017 --> 17:41.685
I went to sleep,
and I woke up the next day,

17:41.769 --> 17:42.936
ready to fight again.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.980
Most people would have been
lucky to pull off the face,

17:45.063 --> 17:46.023
but not very many people

17:46.106 --> 17:47.191
could have pulled off
that shirt.

17:47.274 --> 17:48.150
It's a very good job.

17:48.233 --> 17:50.486
You did exactly
what we're looking for:

17:50.569 --> 17:52.738
Clean, solid, bold,
bright color.

17:52.821 --> 17:55.199
That use of contrast
in a very insignificant part

17:55.282 --> 17:56.658
of the tattoo
is very impressive.

17:56.742 --> 17:58.535
I have a fighting spirit.

17:58.619 --> 18:01.163
You [bleep] on me,
and I come back strong.

18:02.289 --> 18:03.832
An Ink Master, to me,
is somebody

18:03.916 --> 18:05.667
that can do every style.

18:05.751 --> 18:07.795
My specialty
is having no specialty.

18:07.878 --> 18:09.838
{\an5}-Bottom three? Me? Nah!

18:07.878 --> 18:09.838
-[laughs]

18:09.922 --> 18:12.007
{\an8}I'm not the one
to be underestimated.

18:12.090 --> 18:13.884
I am amused right now.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.428
Tiny detailing,
that's what the [bleep] I do.

18:16.512 --> 18:19.264
Let's play.
I rarely drop the ball.

18:19.348 --> 18:21.308
I'm just getting edged out
by who's on the top.

18:21.391 --> 18:23.393
This is day one,
fundamentals.

18:23.477 --> 18:24.561
We have it all.

18:24.645 --> 18:25.771
Let's talk about dimension
in this tattoo.

18:25.854 --> 18:29.525
I believe that it is coming
out of a hollow tree. Wow.

18:29.608 --> 18:32.069
Man, this tattoo
is super smooth.

18:32.152 --> 18:35.781
The structure of this tattoo
really comes to life.

18:35.864 --> 18:38.534
My style is black and gray
macabre horror.

18:38.617 --> 18:40.786
If it's eating something,
I wanna do it.

18:40.869 --> 18:42.079
Everything you do
is a horror flick.

18:42.162 --> 18:42.996
I'm one of
the top guys here.

18:43.080 --> 18:44.915
{\an8}I'm gonna have a target
on my back.

18:44.998 --> 18:46.333
Steve, being
the man at the top,

18:46.416 --> 18:46.875
{\an8}there's a price to pay
for that.

18:46.959 --> 18:48.043
Put on your vest.

18:48.126 --> 18:50.879
Put on your helmets.
I'm shooting at you!

18:50.963 --> 18:52.923
I'm telling you straight up,
this can't be covered.

18:53.006 --> 18:55.843
This tattoo
could cost me $100,000.

18:55.926 --> 18:58.971
This thing is super tech.

18:59.054 --> 19:00.973
You really are
the shining example

19:01.056 --> 19:02.391
for how to do a pinup
in this field.

19:02.474 --> 19:05.519
This tattoo is solid, it has
all the right skin breaks,

19:05.602 --> 19:06.728
this is what
I wanna see.

19:06.812 --> 19:08.230
We're here 'cause
I'm supposed to be good, right?

19:08.313 --> 19:09.231
{\an5}-So...

19:08.313 --> 19:09.231
-Yeah, exactly.

19:09.314 --> 19:10.524
We're gonna have to
prove it today.

Steve, that shirt
is beautiful, man.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.482
[laughter]

19:52.566 --> 19:53.692
All right,
before we get started,

19:53.775 --> 19:56.904
I wanna ask the eliminated
artists a question,

19:56.987 --> 19:59.406
show of hands here,
who expected this

19:59.489 --> 20:00.741
to be our final three?

20:01.533 --> 20:03.535
Wow.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.246
Nobody.

20:07.289 --> 20:08.206
Steve?

20:08.290 --> 20:10.292
This wasn't
my final three.

20:10.375 --> 20:12.044
{\an5}-No?

20:10.375 --> 20:12.044
-Me, probably Sarah,

20:12.127 --> 20:14.129
{\an5}-not Sebastian.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.129
-Why not Sebastian?

20:14.212 --> 20:17.090
23 challenges,
you gotta win one of 'em.

20:17.174 --> 20:20.802
Kutta, four years,
he's won two.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.888
If you-- if you're gonna be
an <i> Ink Master--</i>

20:23.931 --> 20:25.474
{\an5}-wow.

20:23.931 --> 20:25.474
-[cheers and applause]

20:25.557 --> 20:26.975
Let me ask--
Sebastian, let me ask you,

20:27.059 --> 20:28.977
he does have a point.
You didn't win any challenges.

20:29.061 --> 20:31.313
Well, hey, everybody came in
with their game plan,

20:31.396 --> 20:33.607
{\an5}-and this was mine.

20:31.396 --> 20:33.607
-You know what I'm saying?

20:33.690 --> 20:35.192
{\an8}I might not have
won a tattoo challenge,

20:35.275 --> 20:39.196
{\an8}but I stayed one of
the most consistent artists

20:39.279 --> 20:41.281
{\an8}across the board.
You know what I'm saying?

20:41.365 --> 20:44.242
{\an8}I didn't end up in
the bottom until top four,

20:44.326 --> 20:46.495
and that was only
because of what?

20:46.578 --> 20:50.832
A dark-skinned, uh, canvas
and a messed up picture.

20:50.916 --> 20:51.583
Other than that,
I might not have

20:51.667 --> 20:53.502
ended up in the bottom
at all.

20:53.585 --> 20:55.253
Well, I guess the bottom line
is, you're here now.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.881
{\an5}-Mm-hmm, that's right.

20:55.337 --> 20:57.881
-Sarah, let me pass it to you.

20:57.965 --> 20:59.967
I don't know if you're aware
of this, but you lit up--

21:00.050 --> 21:02.886
you lit up the Twitter-sphere
all season long.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.054
{\an5}-Yeah, yeah, I know.

21:02.970 --> 21:04.054
-Yeah, yeah, you did.

21:04.137 --> 21:07.265
{\an5}-[laughs]

21:04.137 --> 21:07.265
-In fact, I have one here.

21:07.349 --> 21:08.266
Okay.

21:08.350 --> 21:09.267
@bmorecdawg says,

21:10.852 --> 21:13.605
{\an8}"Sarah is a psycho.

21:13.689 --> 21:15.357
{\an8}[laughter]

21:15.440 --> 21:17.943
{\an8}I can't believe
she made it this far."

21:18.026 --> 21:19.194
{\an8}How do you respond to that?

21:19.278 --> 21:22.322
Well, I gotta say, there's
a difference between being crazy

21:22.406 --> 21:24.282
and being psychotic.

21:24.366 --> 21:27.661
I know I can come across
as being very intense.

21:27.744 --> 21:29.746
Uh...[laughs]
Yeah, you know, I mean,

21:29.830 --> 21:31.623
you've all seen it
throughout the entire season,

21:31.707 --> 21:34.584
but I really don't think that
intensity is a negative.

21:34.668 --> 21:36.044
If, at the end of the day,
caring about what you do,

21:36.128 --> 21:38.380
putting everything
into your art,

21:38.463 --> 21:40.382
and having passion
about something that you love

21:40.465 --> 21:42.968
{\an5}-is crazy, maybe I'm crazy.

21:40.465 --> 21:42.968
-Hey.

21:43.051 --> 21:46.388
{\an5}-[cheers and applause]

21:43.051 --> 21:46.388
-Let me--

21:46.471 --> 21:49.224
let me--Sarah,
let me just--

21:49.307 --> 21:51.059
let me just chime in.
In your defense,

21:51.143 --> 21:52.853
some of my favorite artists
of all time

21:52.936 --> 21:56.440
have been complete psychopaths,
so you're in good company.

21:56.523 --> 21:57.399
[laughs]

21:57.482 --> 21:59.276
{\an5}-All right.

21:57.482 --> 21:59.276
-All right.

21:59.359 --> 22:01.403
I appreciate
your passion for your art.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.238
{\an5}-Thanks.

22:01.486 --> 22:03.238
-Yeah, we all do.

22:03.321 --> 22:04.740
Just don't go
cutting an ear off.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.742
[laughs]

22:06.825 --> 22:08.285
I'm not really good
at haircutting challenges,

22:08.368 --> 22:10.245
{\an5}-so I think you're safe.

22:08.368 --> 22:10.245
-[laughs]

22:10.328 --> 22:11.496
Well, for the final tattoo,

22:11.580 --> 22:14.249
each of you were sent home
with a master canvas

22:14.332 --> 22:16.877
and 24 hours to tattoo.

22:16.960 --> 22:18.086
These master canvases
agreed to let you apply

22:18.170 --> 22:21.423
whatever design you wanted.

22:21.506 --> 22:24.968
For one of you, it's the most
important tattoo of your life.

22:25.052 --> 22:26.553
Let's take a look.

22:34.519 --> 22:35.312
{\an8}This is the ultimate battle.

22:35.395 --> 22:37.814
I really wanna win
this competition.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.278
{\an8}I'm doing a $100,000
[bleep] tattoo.

22:43.361 --> 22:45.530
I can't see how
I could not win this.

22:49.493 --> 22:50.994
This is not by [bleep]
accident that I'm in the finals.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.789
{\an8}I came here to win it.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.041
{\an5}-Come on back.

22:53.872 --> 22:56.041
-All right, I'm excited.

22:56.124 --> 22:57.375
The judges are my client,

22:57.459 --> 23:00.587
and I'm putting this together
for the judges.

23:00.670 --> 23:05.092
I'm going to have a face
and hands coming through skin.

23:06.885 --> 23:08.178
{\an8}I am in complete shock.

23:08.261 --> 23:09.262
{\an8}Hmm.

23:09.346 --> 23:11.139
It is a lot more masculine

23:11.223 --> 23:13.558
than I had ever imagined
that it would be.

23:16.561 --> 23:18.271
Definitely go big or go home.

23:18.355 --> 23:20.190
I wanna show that I can do
a beautiful portrait

23:20.273 --> 23:22.317
down to as creepy and as dark
as you wanna go,

23:22.400 --> 23:24.444
and make 'em blend, and
the transition be beautiful.

23:24.528 --> 23:26.321
Ready to rock.
Let's do this.

23:31.701 --> 23:34.079
I really want to focus
on Norse mythology.

23:34.162 --> 23:37.499
The Valkyrie on one side
and I want Odin on the other.

23:37.582 --> 23:39.042
When the judges
look at this piece,

23:39.126 --> 23:41.461
I want them to feel
the soul of the tattoo.

23:48.760 --> 23:52.722
{\an5}-[groaning]

23:48.760 --> 23:52.722
-Oh, boy! Oh, my god!

23:52.806 --> 23:53.890
[grunts]

23:58.603 --> 23:59.980
{\an8}Stand up,
and I'll clean you off.

24:00.063 --> 24:01.314
Wow. That's so detailed.

24:01.398 --> 24:04.943
I wouldn't mind
a little bit more time,

24:05.026 --> 24:07.821
but the execution,
I believe, is really clean.

24:07.904 --> 24:08.363
Thank you, thank you.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.115
I think the judges

24:10.198 --> 24:12.033
finally will have a field day
with this one.

24:12.117 --> 24:15.787
I guarantee the judges are
gonna be like, "holy [bleep]!

24:15.871 --> 24:17.706
These mother[bleep]
came for real."

24:17.789 --> 24:20.292
It came out really well,
better than I anticipated.

24:20.375 --> 24:21.459
I stuck to my style,

24:21.543 --> 24:23.211
now, everybody gets to see
what I'm great at.

24:23.295 --> 24:25.714
Those other
two better bring it,

24:25.797 --> 24:27.174
because they're [bleep]
if they don't.

24:28.008 --> 24:34.764
[cheers and applause]

24:37.017 --> 24:40.562
Steve, it looks like
Sebastian did a horror piece,

24:40.645 --> 24:43.481
and that's your specialty.
How do you feel about that?

24:43.565 --> 24:45.233
{\an8}I don't think
it was smart. I mean,

24:45.317 --> 24:48.278
{\an8}he hasn't beat me
23 other times.

24:48.361 --> 24:50.488
{\an8}Why does he think he's
gonna beat me now at what I do?

24:50.572 --> 24:51.406
{\an5}-Wow!

24:50.572 --> 24:51.406
-Ho ho!

24:51.489 --> 24:54.951
All right, Sebastian,
Sarah did color.

24:55.035 --> 24:56.244
Do you think
that's an advantage?

24:56.328 --> 25:00.165
{\an8}You know, color has a tendency
to beat black and gray out,

25:00.248 --> 25:01.750
{\an8}but a slightly
choppy color, man,

25:01.833 --> 25:03.627
a smooth black and Grey
will take out any time.

25:03.710 --> 25:07.047
Mm. Okay. Sarah,
let me ask you a question.

25:07.130 --> 25:10.050
Both of your competitors
did back-pieces.

25:10.133 --> 25:11.760
Is that a concern for you now,
having seen that?

25:11.843 --> 25:16.765
{\an8}No, not really. I think that
I executed some amazing tattoos.

25:16.848 --> 25:19.517
{\an8}They're actually--
it's one concept, two thighs,

25:19.601 --> 25:21.269
I covered a very large
amount of skin,

25:21.353 --> 25:22.604
and I did color,
so hopefully,

25:22.687 --> 25:25.440
I think that's going to push it
to the next level

25:25.523 --> 25:26.441
to impress you guys.

25:26.524 --> 25:28.151
All right.
Well, thank you, guys.

25:28.235 --> 25:29.194
When we come back,

25:29.277 --> 25:33.114
we will reveal
the finalists' 24-hour tattoos.

25:33.198 --> 25:36.326
One of these artists
is about to earn $100,000

25:36.409 --> 25:39.120
{\an8}and the title of <i> Ink Master.</i>

25:39.204 --> 25:42.290
{\an8}Don't forget,
go to vote.Spike.Com

25:42.374 --> 25:44.542
{\an8}to get your favorite
eliminated artist

25:44.626 --> 25:46.586
{\an8}a spot on season three.

25:46.670 --> 25:48.505
{\an8}Time is running out,
so vote now.

25:48.964 --> 25:50.173
Don't go away.

25:50.257 --> 25:57.430
[cheers and applause]

26:03.228 --> 26:09.651
[cheers and applause]

26:09.734 --> 26:12.112
Welcome back
to <i> Ink Master Live.</i>

26:12.195 --> 26:13.321
We are inching our way

26:13.405 --> 26:16.866
awarding one of these artists
$100,000

26:16.950 --> 26:18.660
and the coveted title
of <i> Ink Master.</i>

26:18.743 --> 26:22.872
You were each given 24 hours
and a master canvas

26:22.956 --> 26:25.542
to create your best work ever.

26:25.625 --> 26:28.336
The master canvases
are in the audience tonight.

26:28.420 --> 26:29.546
Welcome, guys.

26:29.629 --> 26:34.259
[applause]

26:35.385 --> 26:36.636
Well, here we go.
This is it.

26:36.720 --> 26:37.846
Let's see
what the judges think.

26:37.929 --> 26:38.763
Let's do it.

26:38.847 --> 26:40.682
Steve, you're up first.

26:41.099 --> 26:43.059
Mr. Peck.

26:45.103 --> 26:47.355
Steve, this is
a big impressive tattoo.

26:47.439 --> 26:49.190
Lots of smooth grays,

26:49.274 --> 26:52.819
and as always, the black
is super dark and saturated.

26:52.902 --> 26:57.407
Very, very technically sound,
very impressive.

26:57.490 --> 27:00.368
Although, there are
a few design elements

27:00.452 --> 27:02.787
that I was not really
in love with.

27:02.871 --> 27:05.540
Um... The shape
of the top of the skull

27:05.623 --> 27:06.916
where it goes
into the girl's shoulders--

27:07.000 --> 27:10.587
you lose what would have been
the natural shape of the skull.

27:10.670 --> 27:13.381
Instead of letting the girl
be higher and--

27:13.465 --> 27:15.050
and finish off the shape
of what that skull would be,

27:15.133 --> 27:18.887
the skull kinda just goes
thinner into the shape of her,

27:18.970 --> 27:20.597
and it kinda--
I think it loses

27:20.680 --> 27:22.724
what the skull should be
a little bit.

27:22.807 --> 27:28.355
But, uh, it's so heavily
dark black at the bottom.

27:28.438 --> 27:31.149
You got all the light gray
at the top.

27:31.232 --> 27:33.568
It gives it a little bit
of a unfinished feel for me

27:33.651 --> 27:35.820
just in the glow around the top.

27:35.904 --> 27:38.865
That being said, like do you
think you used your time wisely?

27:38.948 --> 27:41.993
You had 24 hours.
Could you have used more time?

27:42.077 --> 27:43.244
Would you have wanted more?

27:43.328 --> 27:44.245
Do you feel like this thing
is completely finished?

27:44.329 --> 27:46.414
I feel like it's finished.

27:46.498 --> 27:48.416
I nailed it exactly
the way I wanted it to look.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.584
I wanted to show contrast,

27:49.667 --> 27:51.795
'cause I got yelled it
for my contrast tattoo.

27:51.878 --> 27:53.922
I wanted to show
everything that I do well.

27:54.005 --> 27:56.966
I think the shoulders show
this part of the skull

27:57.050 --> 27:58.551
instead of the full part.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.929
Um, I didn't wanna go too high
up on his neck.

28:01.012 --> 28:02.013
I think-- I love it.

28:02.097 --> 28:04.599
It's me, it's his personality,
mine together.

28:04.682 --> 28:05.642
So I think I love it.

28:05.725 --> 28:08.019
Well, that being said,
the contrast is aces

28:08.103 --> 28:09.771
on this thing, man.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.481
{\an5}-Really good.

28:09.854 --> 28:11.481
-Thanks, Oliver.

28:11.564 --> 28:12.607
Mr. Nunez.

28:12.690 --> 28:14.359
Steve, the layering
on this thing's incredible.

28:14.442 --> 28:15.193
Thank you.

28:15.276 --> 28:16.653
You know,
you were able to go in

28:16.736 --> 28:18.446
and create different layers
of black to gray

28:18.530 --> 28:20.824
and show a great transition.

28:20.907 --> 28:22.117
This is your style.

28:22.200 --> 28:23.368
When you worked
with Sebastian,

28:23.451 --> 28:24.786
when you guys actually
did the board together,

28:24.869 --> 28:27.080
you guys morphed things
one to the other,

28:27.163 --> 28:28.456
one to the other.

28:28.540 --> 28:29.582
And we know that this is
where you come from,

28:29.666 --> 28:31.960
and we're gonna give you
free rein.

28:32.043 --> 28:33.420
This is where
you're gonna go.

28:33.503 --> 28:35.630
I think it's an impressive
tattoo for 24 hours.

28:35.713 --> 28:36.673
Thank you.

28:36.756 --> 28:38.258
I would like to see
a little more detail

28:38.341 --> 28:41.302
on the top of the aura
just to balance out.

28:41.386 --> 28:44.389
But overall, man,
24-hour tattoo-- great job.

28:44.472 --> 28:45.265
Thanks.

28:45.348 --> 28:46.641
Right on, Steve.
Thank you very much.

28:46.724 --> 28:47.642
Thank you.

28:47.725 --> 28:51.646
[cheers and applause]

28:51.729 --> 28:54.607
Sebastian,
you're up next, sir.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.111
{\an5}-Mr. Peck.

28:56.443 --> 28:58.111
-What it do?

28:58.194 --> 29:00.655
Well, Sebastian,
nice shading.

29:00.738 --> 29:04.409
A lot of really nice
light grays.

29:04.492 --> 29:06.953
Really good use of texture.

29:07.036 --> 29:09.205
The wrinkles in the brow,
the teeth,

29:09.289 --> 29:11.708
the stubble on the chin.

29:11.791 --> 29:12.959
A lot of these things, man.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.711
You took a lot
of the challenges

29:14.794 --> 29:17.630
throughout this competition
and put it in this final tattoo.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.090
{\an5}-Yes, sir.

29:17.714 --> 29:19.090
-You did-- all of things

29:19.174 --> 29:21.968
that you do the best
you did in this tattoo.

29:23.052 --> 29:24.012
Surprisingly to me,

29:24.095 --> 29:27.849
there's a lot of weak line work
in this tattoo.

29:27.932 --> 29:28.892
Throughout the competition

29:28.975 --> 29:31.227
that was one
of your main strong points,

29:31.311 --> 29:32.896
so it kinda--

29:32.979 --> 29:35.857
it's confusing to me
that that was your strong point,

29:35.940 --> 29:39.027
and now it's become
the weakest part of this tattoo.

29:39.110 --> 29:43.364
Well, I-- I wanted to do, uh,
more of a portrait style to it.

29:43.448 --> 29:44.699
But, you know, and then
still has to get healed.

29:44.782 --> 29:47.118
So I don't have
any control over that

29:47.202 --> 29:51.122
'cause my lines were not,
you know, my lines are clean.

29:51.206 --> 29:53.917
And the one-- the one comment
I have about the design

29:54.000 --> 29:57.545
is that the hands
look a little misshapen,

29:57.629 --> 29:59.047
like they might be broken
out of place.

29:59.130 --> 30:00.465
Nope. They are exact.

30:00.548 --> 30:03.468
Let's hear
from Mr. Nunez.

30:03.551 --> 30:05.345
Well, I feel like a lot
of the tattoo is a--

30:05.428 --> 30:08.431
is a gray consistency,

30:08.515 --> 30:09.766
and I think with such heavy
subject matter

30:09.849 --> 30:12.560
that you chose to do
on this lady's back,

30:12.644 --> 30:14.229
a little more black.

30:14.312 --> 30:15.480
I'm always by the black.

30:15.563 --> 30:18.733
And I feel like something
this dark needs to be darker,

30:18.816 --> 30:19.609
{\an5}-Mm-hmm.

30:18.816 --> 30:19.609
-Because,

30:19.692 --> 30:20.652
as you even see
in Steve's tattoo,

30:20.735 --> 30:23.738
that black
makes the light pop.

30:23.821 --> 30:25.698
And without that heavy anchor
in these things,

30:25.782 --> 30:28.243
there's areas
where it goes flat.

30:28.326 --> 30:31.037
I would have liked to have seen
you really dive in there,

30:31.120 --> 30:32.580
use a little more black to it,

30:32.664 --> 30:34.290
and really concentrate
on your outlines.

30:34.374 --> 30:38.211
But overall, listen,
it's a great outing for you.

30:38.294 --> 30:39.921
It's not a bad tat.

30:40.004 --> 30:41.339
Sebastian,
thank you very much, man.

30:41.422 --> 30:41.923
All right, man.

30:42.006 --> 30:46.636
[cheers and applause]

30:46.719 --> 30:49.055
Sarah Miller,
please come on up.

30:51.099 --> 30:52.058
Oliver.

30:52.141 --> 30:55.937
Sarah, these are two big
beautiful color tattoos.

30:56.020 --> 31:00.567
Um, the designs
are very well thought out.

31:00.650 --> 31:01.943
They fit the client's leg
perfectly.

31:02.026 --> 31:05.572
I think the client
is super happy with these.

31:05.655 --> 31:09.117
Um, you really put your heart
in these designs.

31:09.200 --> 31:12.745
Um, but technically there--

31:12.829 --> 31:15.039
there's a lot of weak lines,

31:15.123 --> 31:18.459
a lot of the black area
is not really solid.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.920
And, uh, for a lot
of the color field

31:21.004 --> 31:22.630
it's not totally saturated.

31:22.714 --> 31:23.464
It's a little bit of--

31:23.548 --> 31:25.550
little bit of weak
on the color.

31:25.633 --> 31:27.302
And that's been
some of your--

31:27.385 --> 31:28.177
has that rush feel
that we saw

31:28.261 --> 31:29.804
through some
of your other tattoos

31:29.887 --> 31:31.764
throughout the competition.

31:31.848 --> 31:33.349
Um, big question
for me is, uh,

31:33.433 --> 31:35.977
on the girl...

31:36.060 --> 31:39.814
Why did you put the dark,
shading wrinkles under one eye,

31:39.897 --> 31:41.733
making it look like
she has a black eye,

31:41.816 --> 31:43.818
and then not
under the other eye?

31:43.901 --> 31:47.655
It-- it-- that just right there
shows it.

31:47.739 --> 31:48.781
Yup. Well, she's a warrior.

31:48.865 --> 31:50.533
She is in the middle
of a battle right now.

31:50.617 --> 31:53.244
Valkyries aren't angels.

31:53.328 --> 31:56.205
They aren't pristine,
they aren't completely innocent.

31:56.289 --> 31:58.166
She has been
through this battle.

31:58.249 --> 32:00.335
She's been down.
She's fighting.

32:00.418 --> 32:03.254
She represents the fight
in and of herself,

32:03.338 --> 32:06.299
and what I really wanted to show
was she's still there.

32:06.382 --> 32:07.258
She's still standing.

32:07.342 --> 32:10.261
{\an8}She has gone down,
she's taken her lumps.

32:10.345 --> 32:12.555
{\an8}She is back,
and she's in the game.

32:13.806 --> 32:15.350
{\an8}Let's hear from Mr. Nunez.

32:15.433 --> 32:19.896
{\an8}[cheers and applause]

32:19.979 --> 32:22.023
We got to see
these tattoos healed.

32:22.106 --> 32:24.651
And, you know, one thing
about these tattoos

32:24.734 --> 32:28.071
is that, again,
the lack of black

32:28.154 --> 32:30.323
that you put
into your tattoos

32:30.406 --> 32:33.242
makes a dull color field
look duller.

32:33.326 --> 32:35.244
If you put black
into these tattoos

32:35.328 --> 32:36.704
in areas
where they're necessary,

32:36.788 --> 32:38.456
and you don't have fear
to commit--

32:38.539 --> 32:40.458
because you're doing
the big tough tattoos.

32:40.541 --> 32:42.835
Just put a little bit
of tough black in them,

32:42.919 --> 32:45.338
and it'll make the color pop
a little bit more.

32:45.421 --> 32:46.839
I saw the tattoo healed,

32:46.923 --> 32:49.175
and one of the tattoos looked
like it wasn't fresh.

32:49.258 --> 32:50.385
It looked like
it had years on it.

32:50.468 --> 32:54.472
That's because there's a lack
of saturation in the tattoo.

32:54.555 --> 32:56.307
This is something
that you're gonna learn

32:56.391 --> 32:58.059
and you're gonna ease into
as time goes on.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.978
Your background--
it really has a hard ending.

33:01.062 --> 33:03.398
And the only place
that you decide to put black

33:03.481 --> 33:05.024
is on the very end
of your background.

33:05.108 --> 33:08.820
This is something
where we see a design flaw

33:08.903 --> 33:10.238
and where you could
smooth it in

33:10.321 --> 33:11.072
and blow it in
a little bit easier.

33:11.155 --> 33:13.116
I've said all along
background--

33:13.199 --> 33:15.743
backgrounds will be the killer
for tattooers

33:15.827 --> 33:18.287
through
this whole competition.

33:18.371 --> 33:19.997
Thanks, Chris.
Thank you, Sarah.

33:20.081 --> 33:22.750
[applause]

33:22.834 --> 33:24.877
This is going to be
a tough decision.

33:24.961 --> 33:28.214
You've heard what the judges
have to say,

33:28.297 --> 33:30.842
but it's not entirely
in our hands tonight.

33:30.925 --> 33:33.219
Each week over the course
of the season,

33:33.302 --> 33:36.889
taco bell and spike.Com
asked America to vote

33:36.973 --> 33:39.809
for their favorite
elimination tattoo.

33:39.892 --> 33:43.771
We told you the votes would help
determine the next Ink Master.

33:43.855 --> 33:48.025
Those votes are a huge part
of deciding tonight's winner.

33:48.109 --> 33:50.737
You're gonna find out how
right now.

33:52.947 --> 33:53.990
[sigh]

33:54.073 --> 33:57.827
The artist who received
the least amount of votes

33:57.910 --> 33:59.954
from our viewers over the course
of the season

34:00.037 --> 34:02.623
will now be eliminated.

34:05.543 --> 34:10.172
America has studied your work,
scrutinized every detail,

34:10.255 --> 34:13.301
your lines, shading,
precision--

34:13.384 --> 34:15.636
every skill required
to be Ink Master

34:15.719 --> 34:18.306
and America has decided...

34:27.565 --> 34:28.608
Sebastian,

34:28.690 --> 34:31.360
you do not have what it takes
to be Ink Master.

34:32.360 --> 34:33.279
Ollie.

34:35.572 --> 34:37.533
Sebastian, you did a lot
of great tattoos

34:37.617 --> 34:39.494
throughout this entire
competition.

34:39.577 --> 34:41.871
Um, we've already
brought the topic

34:41.954 --> 34:45.081
that you did not win
any of the challenges,

34:45.166 --> 34:47.793
but you were
the most consistent throughout,

34:47.877 --> 34:50.004
even, middle-of-the-road
tattooer.

34:50.087 --> 34:53.341
And you did
a lot of different styles,

34:53.424 --> 34:54.175
but that only gets you so far.

34:54.257 --> 34:56.344
It's gonna get you
to the finale,

34:56.427 --> 34:57.261
but it's not gonna get you
to the top.

34:58.638 --> 34:59.847
Thanks, Oliver.

34:59.931 --> 35:01.432
Sebastian, thank you,

35:01.516 --> 35:03.392
and we do wish you
the best of luck.

35:04.185 --> 35:06.103
All right,
there's still more--

35:06.187 --> 35:09.524
there's still one more vote left
and it's about to close.

35:09.607 --> 35:11.859
When we come back,
we will have the results

35:11.943 --> 35:14.153
and find out which artist
you selected

35:14.237 --> 35:16.989
to get a second chance
on season three

35:17.073 --> 35:20.451
and see who will earn the
coveted title of "Ink Master."

35:21.285 --> 35:21.786
Do not go away.

35:21.869 --> 35:29.126
[cheers and applause]

35:44.767 --> 35:47.728
Welcome back to the live
<i>Ink Master</i> finale.

35:47.812 --> 35:50.523
We are just moments away
from revealing which of you

35:50.606 --> 35:53.067
is walking away
with $100,000

35:53.150 --> 35:56.279
and most importantly
the title of <i> Ink Master</i> .

35:56.362 --> 35:57.864
But before we do that,

35:57.947 --> 35:59.448
the viewers have been voting
all night

35:59.532 --> 36:02.910
{\an8}for their favorite
of our 13 eliminated artists.

36:05.121 --> 36:08.875
{\an8}The artist who gets the most
votes will get a second chance

36:08.958 --> 36:11.460
{\an8}on next season's <i> Ink Master.</i>

36:11.544 --> 36:15.214
Sebastian, this was only open
to the non-finalists,

36:15.298 --> 36:16.757
so you weren't eligible.

36:18.426 --> 36:20.595
America has spoken,

36:20.678 --> 36:23.723
and with over 75 percent
of the vote...

36:23.806 --> 36:25.266
[man in audience] Baby! Whoo!

36:29.061 --> 36:30.229
Tatu Baby...

36:30.313 --> 36:33.441
[cheers and applause]

36:33.524 --> 36:37.361
We will be seeing you
next season on <i> Ink Master.</i>

36:42.992 --> 36:45.119
Ha ha ha!

36:46.996 --> 36:48.831
Tatu Baby, are you ready
for this again?

36:48.915 --> 36:51.626
And I get to get tortured
by you guys all over again?

36:51.709 --> 36:52.877
{\an8}I love it.

36:52.960 --> 36:54.045
{\an8}-You better study!

36:52.960 --> 36:54.045
{\an8}-Let's do it.

36:54.128 --> 36:56.255
{\an8}You better go study.

36:56.339 --> 36:56.964
All right, well,
you've been through this once,

36:57.048 --> 37:00.509
so that's a huge advantage.

37:00.593 --> 37:04.931
Now it's time to decide
who was this season's best.

37:05.014 --> 37:06.349
We've seen some impressive work
from both of you.

37:08.059 --> 37:10.478
Oliver, Chris,

37:10.561 --> 37:14.607
what are your final thoughts
on these 24-hour tattoos?

37:14.690 --> 37:18.194
Steve, this is
a big, bad-ass tattoo, man.

37:18.277 --> 37:21.989
{\an5}-Thank you.

37:18.277 --> 37:21.989
-Um, you really went for it.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.824
You knew exactly what direction
you wanted to take this in.

37:23.908 --> 37:25.242
You stuck to your own style.

37:25.326 --> 37:27.662
You did what you knew
you did best.

37:27.745 --> 37:30.873
And, um...

37:30.957 --> 37:33.334
You know, I gave you a little
bit of harsh criticism--

37:33.417 --> 37:34.418
criticism on it earlier.

37:34.502 --> 37:35.753
But really, man,
this is a great tattoo.

37:35.836 --> 37:37.630
Thank you.

37:37.713 --> 37:39.632
And seeing how good
this tattoo is

37:39.715 --> 37:41.467
proves the fact that you're here
in this final two.

37:41.550 --> 37:42.510
Thank you.

37:43.094 --> 37:46.180
{\an5}-Nuni.

37:43.094 --> 37:46.180
-Sarah...

37:46.263 --> 37:49.850
You have beat out
and made it to this point

37:49.934 --> 37:53.479
through judging--all the people
sitting to your right.

37:54.271 --> 37:55.439
You've come a long way.

37:55.523 --> 37:58.359
You know, you've done
some bad-ass tattoos.

37:58.442 --> 38:02.029
Um, you have six years
in this business.

38:02.113 --> 38:05.783
There's not many artists that
can stand on a worldwide stage

38:05.866 --> 38:09.620
{\an8}where there's-- this is
gonna go and be where you are.

38:09.704 --> 38:11.497
{\an8}At six years
of doing tattoos,

38:11.580 --> 38:15.001
{\an8}here you are with your
tattoos on the main stage.

38:15.084 --> 38:17.169
{\an8}I don't think there's many
of us that are sitting there

38:17.253 --> 38:19.046
{\an8}or sitting here
that could say

38:19.130 --> 38:21.132
that we were there
at that position.

38:21.215 --> 38:24.385
So congratulations
for where you are.

38:24.468 --> 38:26.721
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

38:26.804 --> 38:27.805
You got it.

38:27.888 --> 38:29.390
All right,
you all ready for this?

38:29.473 --> 38:30.266
Ready.

38:30.349 --> 38:31.475
Steve, let me ask you
a question.

38:31.559 --> 38:32.893
What did you think
of Sarah's tattoo?

38:32.977 --> 38:34.895
I think it's great.

38:34.979 --> 38:37.148
Um, ahem,
I truly do believe,

38:37.231 --> 38:39.775
um, that she doesn't
use enough black, uh,

38:39.859 --> 38:40.860
make her color
even more dynamic.

38:40.943 --> 38:43.279
It's definitely her style.

38:43.362 --> 38:44.739
She's done this style
throughout.

38:44.822 --> 38:45.990
She's definitely
one of the best.

38:46.073 --> 38:49.243
I wanted to go against the best.
That's why I'm here.

38:49.326 --> 38:49.910
I like it.
It just needs more black.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.204
It needs more contrast.

38:53.122 --> 38:55.082
Sarah,
your thoughts on Steve's.

38:55.166 --> 38:56.584
I think Steve's skull
is amazing.

38:56.667 --> 39:00.129
He's shown that he has a lot
of technical application.

39:00.212 --> 39:03.674
He can throw solid black and
he can do really creepy images

39:03.758 --> 39:05.426
throughout the entire
competition.

39:05.509 --> 39:08.137
For that, I really,
really applaud this man.

39:08.220 --> 39:09.764
I think that his weakness,
though--

39:09.847 --> 39:12.266
it was the face in the angel

39:12.349 --> 39:14.268
as well as the top part
of the tattoo.

39:14.351 --> 39:16.270
I think
that he could have got

39:16.353 --> 39:17.396
a little bit more life
into the face

39:17.480 --> 39:20.983
and maybe just tightened it up
a little bit more,

39:21.067 --> 39:23.027
because the skull
is so strong.

39:23.110 --> 39:24.195
I think that the top
could have been

39:24.278 --> 39:25.821
just a little bit stronger too.

39:25.905 --> 39:30.201
Maybe just a little bit more
color behind her hair--her hair,

39:30.284 --> 39:34.205
but, um, all in all, I think
you did a really kickass job.

39:34.288 --> 39:35.956
Are you gonna use more black
in your tattoos?

39:36.040 --> 39:37.208
Of course.

39:37.875 --> 39:38.793
Just checking.

39:38.876 --> 39:40.377
[laughing]

39:40.461 --> 39:42.338
I will say that you've always
taken these guys' criticisms

39:42.421 --> 39:45.049
and critiques and applied them
the following day.

39:45.132 --> 39:47.176
{\an5}-Yes.

39:45.132 --> 39:47.176
-All right.

39:47.259 --> 39:49.512
Well, this is it.
It all comes down to this.

39:49.595 --> 39:54.642
For one of you, all that
hard work is about to pay off.

39:54.725 --> 39:57.812
On the line, $100,000,

39:57.895 --> 39:59.563
a feature
in <i> inked</i> magazine,

39:59.647 --> 40:03.692
and the tile of <i> Ink Master.</i>

40:03.776 --> 40:08.239
Sarah, Steve, every drop of ink
you have ever applied

40:08.322 --> 40:11.534
was all building
towards this moment.

40:14.245 --> 40:17.248
The judges have decided...

40:18.833 --> 40:20.876
Steve...

40:24.046 --> 40:25.840
You do have what it takes
to be Ink Master.

40:25.923 --> 40:28.008
[crowd roars]

40:28.092 --> 40:30.553
[cheers and applause]

40:36.392 --> 40:40.020
It's all over
but the crying's on.

40:48.737 --> 40:49.864
That's it.

40:52.241 --> 40:53.367
{\an8}-Great season.

40:52.241 --> 40:53.367
{\an8}-Good show.

40:53.451 --> 40:55.411
{\an8}-Hey, buddy!

40:53.451 --> 40:55.411
{\an8}-Great season, buddy.

40:55.494 --> 40:56.203
{\an8}[Indistinct talking]

40:56.287 --> 41:00.499
{\an8}Hey, easy cheesy
Japanese-y, bro!
