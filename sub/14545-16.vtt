WEBVTT

00:01.102 --> 00:03.771
(Tessa)
WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER, FALL--

00:03.804 --> 00:05.739
I WAS FAMILIAR
WITH ALL FOUR SEASONS,

00:05.773 --> 00:07.608
SO YOU CAN IMAGINE
HOW SURPRISED

00:07.641 --> 00:11.179
I WAS TO LEARN THAT CHATSWIN
HAD ONE MORE SEASON...

00:11.212 --> 00:12.246
CROQUET.

00:12.280 --> 00:13.447
(clatters)

00:15.483 --> 00:16.650
(man) * LET'S GO

00:20.621 --> 00:21.789
* LET'S GO, LET'S GO

00:26.194 --> 00:27.561
TECHNIQUE WAS IMPORTANT,

00:27.595 --> 00:30.498
BUT SO WAS CHEMISTRY
BETWEEN PARTNERS.

00:30.531 --> 00:33.601
HEY, Y'ALL.
THIS IS SVEN FROM ICELAND.

00:33.634 --> 00:35.803
HE'S UNCIRCUMCISED.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.171
(thud)
OW.

00:41.709 --> 00:43.444
HAVING THE WRONG PARTNER COULD
REALLY THROW OFF THE GAME.

00:48.682 --> 00:50.651
(Dallas laughs)

00:50.684 --> 00:51.819
(sighs)

00:55.189 --> 00:56.457
(gasps)

00:56.490 --> 00:58.859
DO THEY HAVE CROQUET IN MEXICO?

00:58.892 --> 01:01.729
OH, I'M FROM GUATEMALA.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.332
CROQUET SEASON COINCIDED
WITH MATING SEASON,

01:04.365 --> 01:07.201
AND DALLAS SEEMED TO BE
ENJOYING HER NEWLY SINGLE LIFE,

01:07.235 --> 01:08.902
EVEN IF IT WAS RAISING
A FEW EYEBROWS.

01:08.936 --> 01:10.104
(Dallas chuckles)

01:10.138 --> 01:11.172
(whispers)
THAT'S A WOMAN.

01:11.205 --> 01:12.573
I CAN SEE THAT, FRED.

01:12.606 --> 01:13.574
(Dallas giggles)

01:16.310 --> 01:20.314
MEANWHILE, A NEW WOMAN HAD JUST
ENTERED MY LIFE AS WELL.

01:20.348 --> 01:22.116
(Anya Marina)
* SEMESTER IS OUT

01:22.150 --> 01:23.684
* UH-HUH, UH-HUH

01:23.717 --> 01:25.419
* THE TEACHER IS IN

01:25.453 --> 01:27.221
* UH-HUH, UH-HUH

01:27.255 --> 01:27.788
* THERE AIN'T NO EXAMS

01:27.821 --> 01:29.457
(Tessa) COOL.

01:29.490 --> 01:32.293
* YOU BETTER BET
YOU'RE GONNA LEARN SOMETHING *

01:32.326 --> 01:35.129
* UH-HUH, UH-HUH

01:35.163 --> 01:38.399
* OH, UH-HUH, UH-HUH

01:38.432 --> 01:40.501
* OH, UH-HUH, UH-HUH

01:40.534 --> 01:43.837
OKAY. WHAT DO YOU THINK
ABOUT THIS ONE?

01:43.871 --> 01:45.739
I THINK IT'S WEIRD THAT
YOU'VE TRIED ON THREE OUTFITS

01:45.773 --> 01:46.807
FOR A POETRY CLASS.

01:46.840 --> 01:48.309
THAT'S BECAUSE YOU DON'T
GET IT, GEORGE.

01:48.342 --> 01:50.478
MS. EVANS IS SUPER COOL.
I HAVE TO LOOK COOL,

01:50.511 --> 01:52.180
OR SHE WON'T REALIZE
HOW COOL I AM.

01:52.213 --> 01:53.914
YOU KNOW, IN MY DAY--
THE EARLY '90s--

01:53.947 --> 01:56.417
COOLNESS WAS ABOUT
NOT TRYING TO LOOK COOL.

01:56.450 --> 01:57.551
NIRVANA TAUGHT US THAT.

01:57.585 --> 02:00.921
DON'T BE STUPID, GEORGE.
MS. EVANS IS FROM SAN FRANCISCO.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.423
SHE HAS A SHOULDER TATTOO,

02:02.456 --> 02:04.492
AND SHE ONCE MADE OUT
WITH CASEY AFFLECK.

02:04.525 --> 02:06.927
I'M GONNA GO
TRY ON SOME CHUNKY GLASSES.

02:06.960 --> 02:10.164
(doorbell rings)

02:10.198 --> 02:12.433
SORRY TO BOTHER YOU, GEORGE,
BUT IT'S AN EMERGENCY.

02:12.466 --> 02:13.534
IT'S ABOUT DALLAS.

02:13.567 --> 02:14.502
THERE'S BEEN AN ACCIDENT.

02:14.535 --> 02:15.503
OH, MY GOD. IS SHE OKAY?

02:15.536 --> 02:16.837
NO, SHE'S NOT.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.906
QUITE FRANKLY,
SHE'S A HOT MESS.

02:18.939 --> 02:20.508
SHE'S BEEN PARADING
A BUNCH OF TRAVELING MEN

02:20.541 --> 02:22.410
AROUND THE CROQUET FIELD.

02:22.443 --> 02:23.911
OKAY, THAT DOESN'T SOUND
LIKE AN ACCIDENT.

02:23.944 --> 02:25.279
IT'S A SOCIAL ACCIDENT.

02:25.313 --> 02:26.647
PEOPLE ARE TALKING.

02:26.680 --> 02:28.249
TO BE FAIR, IT'S MOSTLY US.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.550
AND THAT'S USUALLY
HOW IT STARTS.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.519
SHE'S BEEN ACTING LIKE
A REAL TRAMP.

02:31.552 --> 02:33.221
AND THAT'S GONNA DRIVE DOWN
PROPERTY VALUES.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.922
I DON'T SEE HOW IT COULD.
"TRAMP TOWN"?

02:34.955 --> 02:36.690
I DON'T WANT TO LIVE THERE.
I MIGHT PLAN A DAY TRIP...

02:36.724 --> 02:38.459
GEORGE, DALLAS NEEDS HELP

02:38.492 --> 02:40.294
AND STABILITY
AND A CROQUET PARTNER

02:40.328 --> 02:41.429
WHO DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
HE HAS--

02:41.462 --> 02:43.264
CRABS.

02:43.297 --> 02:44.164
OKAY, LOOK, I DON'T KNOW

02:44.198 --> 02:45.999
IF DALLAS WOULD WANT ME
TO BE HER PARTNER.

02:46.033 --> 02:47.601
THE LAST TIME I TRIED
TO GIVE HER PERSONAL ADVICE,

02:47.635 --> 02:49.370
WE GOT INTO A FIGHT.

02:49.403 --> 02:51.004
SHE'S A LITTLE SENSITIVE
POST-DIVORCE.

02:51.038 --> 02:53.407
WELL, NO BETTER WAY
TO MEND HURT FEELINGS

02:53.441 --> 02:54.808
THAN WITH A MALLET
AND SOME BALLS.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.176
AMEN.

03:08.656 --> 03:10.558

03:10.591 --> 03:13.927
WE CLOSED EARLY FOR INVENTORY.

03:13.961 --> 03:16.497
YOU HOME?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.599
(singsongy) HELLO?

03:18.632 --> 03:21.535
ANYBODY HOME?

03:21.569 --> 03:22.870
(chuckles)

03:27.675 --> 03:28.642
ALL RIGHT.

03:28.676 --> 03:33.681
HANK MOODY, WHOSE BOOTY
SHALL WE PLUNDER TODAY?

03:33.714 --> 03:35.449
DAMN IT!

03:35.483 --> 03:36.617
OHH!

03:43.524 --> 03:44.525
OHH.

03:44.558 --> 03:48.596
WHERE IS THAT STUPID PASSWORD?

03:48.629 --> 03:49.763

(book thuds)

04:27.067 --> 04:28.268
(sighs)

04:32.640 --> 04:35.476
MADE ME REALIZE WHAT I'D REALLY
BEEN MISSING IN CHATSWIN--

04:35.509 --> 04:38.546
A ROLE MODEL, SOMEONE COOL
WHOSE STYLE AND TASTE

04:38.579 --> 04:40.348
I COULD ACTUALLY LOOK UP TO.

04:40.381 --> 04:43.617
YOU ALL DID A GREAT JOB ON
YOUR FIRST IN-CLASS ASSIGNMENT,

04:43.651 --> 04:46.854
BUT I WANT TO SINGLE OUT
A SPECIAL STUDENT IN OUR MIDST.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.689
IN FACT, I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF WE CAN REALLY CALL

04:48.722 --> 04:50.358
THIS PERSON A "STUDENT,"

04:50.391 --> 04:53.126
FOR I BELIEVE SHE'S HERE
TO TEACH US.

04:53.160 --> 04:54.728
IT WASN'T LIKE ME TO SHOWBOAT,

04:54.762 --> 04:57.531
BUT IT ALSO WASN'T LIKE ME
TO QUESTION THE JUDGMENT

04:57.565 --> 04:59.567
OF SOMEONE
AS COOL AS MS. EVANS.

04:59.600 --> 05:02.770
DALIA ROYCE,
WILL YOU DO US THE HONOR

05:02.803 --> 05:05.539
OF READING YOUR POEM,
"AIDS FROWNY FACE,"

05:05.573 --> 05:06.807
FOR THE CLASS?

05:06.840 --> 05:08.542
DALIA ROYCE?

05:08.576 --> 05:09.977
IS THAT BITCH HIGH?

05:10.010 --> 05:11.345
(school bell rings)

05:15.148 --> 05:17.851
MS. EVANS...

05:17.885 --> 05:19.720
ARE YOU HIGH?

05:19.753 --> 05:21.455
NEVER MIND.

05:21.489 --> 05:24.592
I'M SUPER EXCITED
FOR THIS CLASS,

05:24.625 --> 05:27.761
AND I... REALLY
LOVE POETRY.

05:27.795 --> 05:31.699
THANKS, TESSA.
THAT'S A GREAT ATTITUDE.

05:31.732 --> 05:33.501
(lowered voice)
POETRY LOVES YOU, TOO.

05:33.534 --> 05:35.869
(gasps) GOOD.

05:35.903 --> 05:37.538
(chuckles)
I WAS HOPING IT DID.

05:37.571 --> 05:39.106
LOOK, I JUST WANTED
TO LET YOU KNOW,

05:39.139 --> 05:42.676
UNLIKE EVERYONE ELSE
IN THIS TOWN, I GET IT.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.478
(singsongy)
CHATSWIN IS SUPER WEIRD...

05:44.512 --> 05:45.713
(normal voice)
AND KINDA SHALLOW,

05:45.746 --> 05:48.449
AND IF YOU EVER NEED
SOMEONE TO STAND APART

05:48.482 --> 05:50.718
AND OBSERVE
THE SHALLOW WEIRDNESS

05:50.751 --> 05:53.521
WITH AN ACERBIC WIT,

05:53.554 --> 05:55.389
I'M YOUR GIRL.

05:55.423 --> 05:58.792
I'LL KEEP THAT IN MIND.

05:58.826 --> 06:00.861
A 72?

06:00.894 --> 06:03.664
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK
YOU CAN'T ASSIGN A NUMBER GRADE

06:03.697 --> 06:06.534
TO SOMETHING AS SUBJECTIVE
AS A POEM,

06:06.567 --> 06:08.135
BUT YOU CAN.

06:08.168 --> 06:09.437
HUH.

06:09.470 --> 06:10.671
DON'T BE SO HARD
ON YOURSELF.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.407
WE CAN'T ALL BE DALIA ROYCE
RIGHT OUT OF THE GATE.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.042
YOU KNOW, I HAVE BEEN
TEACHING POETRY

06:15.075 --> 06:17.611
FOR 2 1/4 YEARS NOW,

06:17.645 --> 06:21.014
AND I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYONE
QUITE LIKE HER BEFORE.

06:21.048 --> 06:22.049
YEAH, SHE'S UNIQUE.

06:22.082 --> 06:25.052
SHE'S ABLE TO MAKE
SMALL REVELATIONS SEEM COMPLEX.

06:25.085 --> 06:29.156
HER VOICE HAS
A SORT OF DETACHED OPACITY.

06:29.189 --> 06:31.224
OH, IS THAT WHAT IT HAS?

06:31.258 --> 06:33.093
SOME OF THAT ACERBIC WIT
YOU WERE REFERRING TO?

06:33.126 --> 06:35.062
NOT BAD, TESSA. NOT BAD.

06:35.095 --> 06:37.531
I'D GIVE IT A 74.

06:37.565 --> 06:38.699
I KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE THINKING,

06:38.732 --> 06:42.970
AND, YES,
YOU CAN ALSO GRADE WIT.

06:43.003 --> 06:43.571
THANKS.

06:43.604 --> 06:44.772
MM-HMM.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.009
(indistinct conversations)

06:49.042 --> 06:51.044
I HEARD THIS GROUP WAS LOOKING
FOR A FOURTH.

06:51.078 --> 06:52.179
REALLY, SHEILA?

06:52.212 --> 06:54.682
GEORGE ALTMAN? THAT'S WHO YOU
WANTED TO SET ME UP WITH?

06:54.715 --> 06:57.985
YES, FOR CROQUET.
LOOKIN' GOOD, GEORGE.

06:58.018 --> 07:01.755
REALLY? I'D SAY HE'S LOOKING
A LITTLE FAT IN THE FACE.

07:01.789 --> 07:03.123
FRED, NICE TO SEE YOU.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.958
SO, GEORGE, ARE YOU HERE
TO TELL ME HOW TO LIVE

07:04.992 --> 07:07.995
MY NEWLY SINGLE LIFE,
OPPRESS ME, FINESSE ME,

07:08.028 --> 07:10.831
REDRESS ME, WRAP ME
HEAD TO TOE IN A SHERPA?

07:10.864 --> 07:12.099
I-I THINK YOU MEAN A BURKA.

07:12.132 --> 07:14.902
I REFUSE TO BE CORRECTED
BY THE LIKES OF YOU.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.204
I MAY HAVE USED THE WRONG WORD,
BUT THAT'S MY RIGHT.

07:17.237 --> 07:20.674
I'M A FULL-GROWN WOMAN,
GEORGE ALTMAN. FULL-GROWN.

07:20.708 --> 07:23.477
(chuckles) DALLAS, RELAX.
NO ONE THINKS YOU'RE...

07:23.511 --> 07:24.144
STILL GROWING.

07:24.177 --> 07:26.246
GOOD.
LOOK, I COME IN PEACE.

07:26.279 --> 07:27.047
I JUST THOUGHT
IT MIGHT BE NICE

07:27.080 --> 07:28.782
TO BE ON THE SAME TEAM
FOR A CHANGE.

07:28.816 --> 07:30.751
WELL, WE'LL JUST SEE
ABOUT THAT, GEORGE.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.019
I'D LIKE TO RESERVE JUDGMENT

07:32.052 --> 07:33.787
UNTIL I SEE
HOW YOU HANDLE YOUR MALLET.

07:33.821 --> 07:35.222
OH, THIS?

07:35.255 --> 07:36.590
I GOT THIS.

07:38.258 --> 07:39.827
BOOM!

07:39.860 --> 07:40.694
(chuckles) WHAT WAS THAT?

07:40.728 --> 07:42.262
(chuckles)
WAS THAT YOUR SWING? (laughs)

07:42.295 --> 07:43.964
THAT'S NOT HOW
IT'S DONE, GEORGE.
OHH.

07:43.997 --> 07:44.665
IT'S THROUGH THE LEGS.

07:44.698 --> 07:45.933
LET ME SHOW YOU.
I'LL SHOW HIM.

07:45.966 --> 07:48.201
STAND DOWN, FRED.

07:48.235 --> 07:52.540
FIRST OF ALL, YOU GOTTA GET
A GOOD GRIP ON THAT SHAFT, OKAY?

07:52.573 --> 07:54.608
OKAY.
TIGHT, BUT DON'T CHOKE IT,
ALL RIGHT?

07:54.642 --> 07:55.876
NICE. GOOD.

07:55.909 --> 07:57.044
SLOW THRUST HERE. THRUST...

07:57.077 --> 07:58.311
MM-HMM.

07:58.345 --> 08:00.013
WITH A LOT
OF FOLLOW-THROUGH.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.014
MM-HMM.
ALL RIGHT.

08:01.048 --> 08:03.717
GONNA USE YOUR BODY
TO DRIVE IT.

08:03.751 --> 08:06.153
DRIVE IT. DRIVE IT.

08:06.186 --> 08:07.320
DRIVE IT, GEORGE.

08:07.354 --> 08:09.189
DRIVE IT. GOOD. DRIVE IT.

08:09.222 --> 08:10.524
DRIVE IT
IN A STRAIGHT LINE.

08:10.558 --> 08:13.326
DRIVE IT! ALL RIGHT.
DRIVE IT, GEORGE!

08:13.360 --> 08:15.062
WHOO!
BEAUTIFUL!

08:15.095 --> 08:16.630
THAT WAS BEAUTIFUL!

08:16.664 --> 08:19.099
IT REALLY WAS. GO, GEORGE!

TIMBER! HA HA HA HA!

08:38.719 --> 08:41.789
* SAY GOOD-BYE
TO CONVENTIONAL WAYS *

08:41.822 --> 08:43.323
* YOU CAN'T ESCAPE THE HOURS

08:43.356 --> 08:45.626

08:51.865 --> 08:52.933
(grunts)

08:52.966 --> 08:56.103
* EVERYBODY WANTS YOU

08:56.136 --> 08:58.305
(George) HA HA HA!

08:58.338 --> 09:00.741
* WHOO

09:00.774 --> 09:01.775
(lowered voice) ENOUGH.

09:01.809 --> 09:03.811
WHAT?
YOU'VE MADE YOUR POINT.

09:03.844 --> 09:05.979
YOU'RE A CROQUET GOD.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.949
NOW STICK IT BACK IN YOUR PANTS
AND SHOW A LITTLE DIGNITY.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.317
WHOA. FRED,
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

09:10.350 --> 09:14.121
YOU ARE FROTHING MY WIFE UP
INTO A FROTHY FRENZY,

09:14.154 --> 09:16.356
AND I WOULD APPRECIATE
A LITTLE DECORUM.

09:16.389 --> 09:19.192
UH, OKAY. I DIDN'T MEAN
TO FROTH ANYONE.

09:19.226 --> 09:21.328
WELL, YOU JUST REMEMBER THIS,
GEORGE ALTMAN.

09:21.361 --> 09:23.797
SHEILA'S LAST NAME IS
THE SAME AS MINE,

09:23.831 --> 09:25.999
SO NO MATTER HOW MUCH
SHE MAY FANTASIZE ABOUT

09:26.033 --> 09:29.870
YOUR TUMESCENT ADDENDUM,
I'M THE MAN SHE MARRIED.

09:29.903 --> 09:30.604
GOT IT?

09:30.638 --> 09:32.706
I-I DON'T KNOW WHAT
THAT MEANS.

09:32.740 --> 09:34.842
WHAT IS THAT ON YOUR FACE?
IS THAT DIRT?

09:34.875 --> 09:38.178
(scoffs) I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

09:43.250 --> 09:47.320
(indistinct conversations)

09:47.354 --> 09:48.956
WHAT DO YOU THINK
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT?

09:48.989 --> 09:51.024
WHO?

09:51.058 --> 09:52.660
MS. EVANS IS PROBABLY
TELLING DALIA

09:52.693 --> 09:55.963
ABOUT SOME COOL, NEW BAND
WHOSE BASS PLAYER

09:55.996 --> 09:57.731
SHE USED TO DATE,

09:57.765 --> 10:00.801
A BAND DALIA WOULD NEVER
IN A MILLION YEARS BE INTO,

10:00.834 --> 10:03.136
BUT I WOULD HAVE LOVED.

10:03.170 --> 10:04.738
WELL, I'M NOT
A PROFESSIONAL LIP-READER,

10:04.772 --> 10:08.642
BUT I THINK DALIA JUST SAID
SOMETHING ABOUT BROWNIES?

10:08.676 --> 10:11.144
OR BRAN EYES?
BROWN THIGHS.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.881
I HOPE DALIA ENJOYS
THE ATTENTION WHILE IT LASTS,

10:13.914 --> 10:17.217
BECAUSE THAT'S
GONNA BE ME SOON.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.153
ONCE MS. EVANS READS
THE POEM I JUST FINISHED...

10:20.187 --> 10:22.222
(exhales deeply)
THINGS ARE GONNA GO

10:22.255 --> 10:24.391
A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY
AROUND HERE.

10:24.424 --> 10:25.726
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
A TOUGH TIME COMPETING

10:25.759 --> 10:27.227
WITH THE ONE I WROTE
ABOUT RYAN.

10:27.260 --> 10:29.429
WELL, I'M NOT MESSING
AROUND ANYMORE.

10:29.462 --> 10:30.998
(paper rustles loudly)

10:31.031 --> 10:34.001
I DECIDED TO GO THERE.

10:34.034 --> 10:34.968
ARE YOU--

10:35.002 --> 10:36.269
PLAYING THE "MOM LEFT
WHEN I WAS YOUNG" CARD?

10:36.303 --> 10:39.807
YEAH. YES, I AM.

10:39.840 --> 10:42.342
DESPERATE TIMES CALL
FOR DESPERATE MEASURES.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.077
SEEMS PRETTY DESPERATE.

10:47.981 --> 10:50.483
THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE BEATEN THE SHAYS EVER.

10:50.517 --> 10:53.220
FELT GOOD. FELT REAL GOOD.

10:53.253 --> 10:54.287
THANK YOU.

10:54.321 --> 10:58.191
DID YOU NOTICE ANYTHING
STRANGE ABOUT SHEILA TODAY?

10:58.225 --> 10:59.092
YOU MEAN THE SHOES?

10:59.126 --> 11:00.894
I WASN'T GONNA GO THERE,
BUT IT LOOKED LIKE

11:00.928 --> 11:02.963
SHE STOLE 'EM OFF
A COURT JESTER.

11:02.996 --> 11:04.998
THERE! SOMEBODY SAID IT.

11:05.032 --> 11:06.967
(lowered voice) I WASN'T
TALKING ABOUT HER SHOES.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.136
DID YOU NOTICE HER
THROWING ME ANY VIBES?

11:09.169 --> 11:11.338
VIBES? WHAT KIND OF VIBES?

11:11.371 --> 11:13.340
(sighs) SEXUAL VIBES.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.375
I THINK
YOU'RE STONE-COLD TRIPPIN'.

11:15.408 --> 11:16.810
IF I RECALL, JUST RECENTLY,

11:16.844 --> 11:19.212
YOU ACCUSED ME OF BEING
INTO YOU AS WELL.

11:19.246 --> 11:21.048
AFTER YOU KISSED ME,
NOT TO HARP,

11:21.081 --> 11:23.050
BUT THIS--
THIS IS DIFFERENT.

11:23.083 --> 11:25.152
(chuckles) SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEONE'S DECIDED

11:25.185 --> 11:27.487
THEY'RE THE WHITE WESLEY SNIPES
OF CHATSWIN.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.389
THE WHOLE FEMALE POPULATION'S
IN SOME SORT

11:29.422 --> 11:30.523
OF HORMONAL TIZZY...
(cell phone alert chimes)

11:30.557 --> 11:33.827
SINCE YOU ROLLED INTO TOWN.
IS THAT IT, GEORGE? (sighs)

11:33.861 --> 11:36.864
(whispers) I'M NOT WEARING
ANY UNDERWEAR. (gasps)

11:41.234 --> 11:45.138
"BUGATTI VEYRON.
LAMBORGHINI MURCEILAGO.

11:45.172 --> 11:49.009
"PAGANI ZONDA. FERRARI ENZO.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.143
"THINK ABOUT IT.

11:50.177 --> 11:52.545
"YOU GUYS.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.914
CARS."

12:01.554 --> 12:03.290
BOOM.

12:03.323 --> 12:04.825
(whispers) WOW.

12:04.858 --> 12:06.026
(normal voice) POWERFUL.

12:07.327 --> 12:11.098
WOW. I JUST GOT IT.

12:11.131 --> 12:15.002
WELCOME, LISA...
TO GETTING IT.

12:15.035 --> 12:17.971
OKAY. (chuckles) WHEW.

12:18.005 --> 12:19.439
(chuckles)
WHO'D LIKE TO GO NEXT?

12:19.472 --> 12:22.242
ALTHOUGH I CAN'T IMAGINE TRYING
TO FOLLOW THAT ACT.

12:28.816 --> 12:30.884
(sighs)

12:30.918 --> 12:32.820
"MOTHER.

12:32.853 --> 12:36.023
"GIRL TURNS 3
ON A STORE-BOUGHT CAKE.

12:36.056 --> 12:39.159
"EXTINGUISHED THE CANDLES

12:41.895 --> 12:45.032

12:50.904 --> 12:54.007

12:54.041 --> 12:55.442
OKEYDOKEY.

12:55.475 --> 12:58.045
(school bell rings)

12:58.078 --> 12:59.813
TESSA, CAN I SEE YOU
FOR A MOMENT?

12:59.847 --> 13:02.315
(singsong voice, under breath)
FINALLY. SOME RECOGNITION.

13:02.349 --> 13:05.052
(whispers) OKAY.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.253
CAN I ASK YOU
SOMETHING PERSONAL?

13:06.286 --> 13:09.189
OH, GO YES!
ASK ME ANYTHING.

13:09.222 --> 13:10.457
LET'S CONNECT.

13:10.490 --> 13:13.526
WAS THERE ANY TRUTH
BEHIND YOUR POEM TODAY?

13:13.560 --> 13:15.462
A LOT OF TRUTH.

13:15.495 --> 13:16.964
SO MUCH TRUTH, TRULY.

13:16.997 --> 13:19.032
HUH. STRANGE.

13:19.066 --> 13:21.134
I FOUND MYSELF NOT CARING.

13:21.168 --> 13:21.835
NOT--

13:21.869 --> 13:24.137
CARING AT ALL,
AND IT PAINED ME

13:24.171 --> 13:27.074
TO SEE YOU GRASPING
AT STRAWS CREATIVELY.

13:27.107 --> 13:30.077
DALIA, WOULD YOU CONSIDER
WORKING WITH TESSA

13:30.110 --> 13:31.278
ON HER POETRY?

13:31.311 --> 13:32.880
UGH. DO I HAVE TO?

13:32.913 --> 13:34.581
NO, CERTAINLY NOT.
TOTALLY UP TO YOU.

13:34.614 --> 13:36.283
I REALLY DON'T LIKE TESSA.

13:36.316 --> 13:40.120
WOW. YOU DON'T PULL
ANY PUNCHES, DO YOU?

13:40.153 --> 13:40.954
(whispers) THAT'S BRAVE.

13:40.988 --> 13:43.190
IT'S JUST
I REALLY CAN'T STAND TESSA.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.358
SO HONEST.

13:45.392 --> 13:48.996
LOOK, I CAN THROW IN
A LITTLE EXTRA CREDIT FOR YOU.

13:50.130 --> 13:51.664
OKAY. FINE.

13:51.698 --> 13:54.534
I GUESS I'LL DO IT,
SINCE IT'S FOR EXTRA CREDIT.

13:54.567 --> 13:57.905
YOU ARE BOTH SHREWD AND WISE,
DALIA ROYCE.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.440
I KNOW.

14:00.473 --> 14:02.242
GOOD NEWS.
SHE'S WILLING TO--

14:02.275 --> 14:04.544
YEAH. I HEARD.

14:10.717 --> 14:13.620
I DON'T HAVE
AN ORIGINAL IDEA IN MY HEAD.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.188
POETRY CLASS NOT GOING WELL?

14:15.222 --> 14:17.457
TEACHER DIDN'T GIVE YOU AN "A"
FOR THOSE CHUNKY GLASSES?

14:17.490 --> 14:19.426
SHE'S NOT INTO ME.
OH, COME ON.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.361
BELIEVE ME, NO ONE'S
MORE SURPRISED THAN I AM.

14:21.394 --> 14:25.032
MS. EVANS IS INEXPLICABLY
ENAMORED WITH... DALIA.

14:25.065 --> 14:26.699
DALIA ROYCE.

14:26.733 --> 14:27.600
I DON'T GET IT.

14:27.634 --> 14:28.335
YIKES.

14:28.368 --> 14:30.503
YEAH. IT STINGS.
IT STINGS A LOT.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.539
DALIA IS THE MOST VAPID,
SHALLOW, BLACK HOLE

14:32.572 --> 14:33.406
OF A HUMAN BEING
I'VE EVER MET.

14:33.440 --> 14:36.409
OH, O-OKAY.
DON'T TAKE IT OUT ON DALIA.

14:36.443 --> 14:38.545
H-HAVE YOU EVER CONSIDERED THAT
MAYBE IT'S NOT SO EASY BEING

14:38.578 --> 14:39.947
THE OBJECT OF AFFECTION?

14:39.980 --> 14:40.880
NO.
I'M JUST SAYING,

14:40.914 --> 14:44.184
SOMETIMES IT HARD TO BE
AGGRESSIVELY ADORED

14:44.217 --> 14:46.453
BY SOMEONE WHOSE ATTENTION
YOU DON'T REALLY WANT.

14:46.486 --> 14:49.923
MAYBE, JUST MAYBE,
DALIA IS THE REAL VICTIM HERE.

14:49.957 --> 14:50.890
REALLY? THIS IS WHERE
YOU WANT TO TAKE

14:50.924 --> 14:53.260
THE CONVERSATION, GEORGE?
SYMPATHY FOR DALIA?

14:53.293 --> 14:55.628
YOU ARE A HORRIBLE DAD.

14:55.662 --> 14:57.397
NOW THAT'S THE KIND
OF NEGATIVE ATTENTION

14:57.430 --> 14:58.565
I'M USED TO.

15:10.577 --> 15:12.379
(sighs)

15:12.412 --> 15:15.949
(lowered voice) WHAT ARE YOU
DREAMING ABOUT, SHEILA?

15:15.983 --> 15:19.486
ARE YOU DREAMING ABOUT
GORGEOUS GEORGE ALTMAN?

15:19.519 --> 15:21.721
IS HE THE HOT DELIVERY BOY
TONIGHT,

15:21.754 --> 15:25.025
COMING TO YOUR DOOR
WITH A PILE OF FRESH MEAT?

15:25.058 --> 15:28.528
NO. NO, NO, NO.
STOP DREAMING ABOUT HIM.

15:28.561 --> 15:31.031
DREAM ABOUT FRED,

15:31.064 --> 15:33.366
COMFORTABLE, STEADFAST FRED,

15:33.400 --> 15:36.103
ALWAYS-THERE-FOR-YOU FRED,

15:36.136 --> 15:39.239
FRED
OF THE KILLER FOOT MASSAGE.

15:39.272 --> 15:41.441
(sighs) OHH.
I CAN'T TAKE IT.

15:41.474 --> 15:43.143
I CAN'T TAKE IT.
(switch clicks)

15:43.176 --> 15:45.012
WHAT? WHAT IS IT?
IS IT A NIGHT PROWLER?

15:45.045 --> 15:47.114
(sighs) NO.

15:47.147 --> 15:48.381
(sighs)
SHEILA, WE NEED TO TALK.

15:48.415 --> 15:50.117
I-I READ YOUR DIARY.

15:50.150 --> 15:53.753
WHAT? FRED, THAT'S
A VIOLATION OF MY PRIVACY.

15:53.786 --> 15:56.089
I KNOW. I'M SORRY.

15:56.123 --> 15:57.724
BELIEVE ME,
I WISH I HADN'T SEEN IT,

15:57.757 --> 16:01.161
BECAUSE NOW I KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT GEORGE,

16:01.194 --> 16:02.629
AND I CAN'T GET IT OUT
OF MY HEAD.

16:02.662 --> 16:05.098
(sighs)

16:05.132 --> 16:07.767
WELL...
MAYBE IT'S FOR THE BEST.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.036
WHAT?

16:09.069 --> 16:11.238
HAVING IT OUT IN THE OPEN,
I MEAN.

16:11.271 --> 16:12.772
IT'S A SCHOOLGIRL FANTASY.

16:12.805 --> 16:14.707
BUT YOU'RE NOT A SCHOOLGIRL.

16:14.741 --> 16:16.743
(sighs)

16:16.776 --> 16:19.046
I'M GLAD YOU KNOW.

16:19.079 --> 16:20.513
I LOVE YOU, FRED,

16:20.547 --> 16:21.781
AND THAT IS UNCHANGED
BY THE FACT

16:21.814 --> 16:24.251
THAT I LUST ENDLESSLY
OVER GEORGE.

16:29.789 --> 16:31.391
(sighs) OHH.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.559
(panting)

16:34.194 --> 16:37.197
(lowered voice)
GROW, YOU BASTARD. GROW.

16:37.230 --> 16:38.698
(inhales deeply and sighs)

16:38.731 --> 16:40.500
WHETHER OR NOT
DALIA WAS ACTUALLY GOOD

16:40.533 --> 16:42.202
AT POETRY DIDN'T MATTER.

16:42.235 --> 16:45.438
MS. EVANS THOUGHT SHE WAS,
AND I HAD TO FIND OUT WHY.

16:45.472 --> 16:46.706
HOW?

16:46.739 --> 16:48.341
IT'S EASY.

16:48.375 --> 16:52.179
I JUST EMPTY MY HEAD,
AND WORDS POP IN IT.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.614
COULD YOU WALK ME THROUGH
THAT PROCESS STEP-BY-STEP?

16:54.647 --> 16:57.350
YOU KNOW, YOU SUCK
RIGHT NOW, EVEN FOR YOU.

16:57.384 --> 16:58.785
JUST TELL ME HOW TO WRITE
GOOD POETRY

16:58.818 --> 16:59.852
THAT MS. EVANS WILL LIKE!

16:59.886 --> 17:02.589
JUST STOP TRYING SO HARD!

17:02.622 --> 17:03.390
(brush clatters)

17:03.423 --> 17:04.291
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE TOTALLY FANNING OUT

17:04.324 --> 17:06.859
OVER SOME GROSS TEACHER
WITH GREASY HAIR.

17:06.893 --> 17:08.295
MS. EVANS IS AWESOME.

17:08.328 --> 17:09.196
HOW WOULD YOU KNOW?

17:09.229 --> 17:12.165
ALL YOU KNOW IS
THAT SHE DOESN'T LIKE YOU.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.566
SHE'S YOUR SCOTT STRAUSS.

17:13.600 --> 17:15.068
WHAT?
REMEMBER WHEN HE WAS DATING

17:15.102 --> 17:16.803
THAT REALLY UGLY GIRL...
THAT WAS ME.

17:16.836 --> 17:19.839
AND THE MORE HE DIDN'T JOCK ME,
THE MORE I JOCKED HIM?

17:19.872 --> 17:21.108
THAT'S YOU,

17:21.141 --> 17:26.679
EXCEPT WITH A SAD, MIDDLE-AGED,
WEIRDO POETRY TEACHER WITH B.O.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.649
DID I JUST RECEIVE A LESSON
IN HUMAN NATURE

17:29.682 --> 17:32.585
FROM THE LEAST HUMAN PERSON
I KNOW?

17:32.619 --> 17:35.255
YEAH, YOU THINK
ABOUT THAT, BEEYOTCH,

17:35.288 --> 17:36.789
BECAUSE I SEE IT
SINKING IN.

17:36.823 --> 17:38.625
(doorbell rings)

17:38.658 --> 17:40.427
I WANT YOU TO MAKE LOVE
TO MY WIFE.

17:40.460 --> 17:42.895
FRED, DIGGIN' THE GOATEE.

17:42.929 --> 17:44.631
(sighs)
COME ON IN.

17:45.898 --> 17:46.799
I CAN'T.

17:46.833 --> 17:50.570
I-I CARE ABOUT YOU
AS A FRIEND, BUT I CAN'T.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.538
I WON'T.

17:51.571 --> 17:53.740
OKAY, LOOK, GEORGE, NOAH,

17:53.773 --> 17:56.709
I'VE PUT A LOT OF THOUGHT
INTO THIS. A LOT.

17:56.743 --> 17:58.345
I LOVE MY WIFE.

17:58.378 --> 18:00.547
SHE MEANS THE WORLD TO ME,

18:00.580 --> 18:03.283
BUT SHE HAS NEEDS
THAT I'M NOT FULFILLING,

18:03.316 --> 18:05.152
AND I WANT THEM TO BE FULFILLED.

18:05.185 --> 18:06.286
FRED, PLEASE--

18:06.319 --> 18:08.821
HEAR THE MAN OUT.
(chuckles)

18:08.855 --> 18:10.623
(sighs)
I-I HAVE PRIDE, SURE,

18:10.657 --> 18:12.692
BUT I CAN CRUMPLE
THAT PRIDE UP

18:12.725 --> 18:14.494
INTO A LITTLE BALL
AND EAT IT.

18:14.527 --> 18:16.463
FOR SHEILA, I CAN EAT IT,
AND I WILL.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.598
FRED, SHEILA LOVES YOU.

18:18.631 --> 18:20.633
IF THERE IS
SOME FLEETING INFATUATION

18:20.667 --> 18:23.736
THAT SHE HAS GOING ON WITH ME,
IT'S JUST THAT--FLEETING.

18:23.770 --> 18:27.674
ARE YOU SAYING NO? I MEAN,
YOU WON'T SATISFY MY WIFE?

18:27.707 --> 18:30.477
WHAT, IS SHE NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR YOU, MR. ALTMAN?

18:30.510 --> 18:31.744
'CAUSE LET ME TELL YOU
SOMETHING.

18:31.778 --> 18:33.513
SHE WILL DO THINGS TO YOU--

18:33.546 --> 18:35.748
THINGS YOU CAN'T
EVEN IMAGINE,

18:35.782 --> 18:36.883
THINGS THAT AREN'T
EVEN LEGAL.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.385
I BELIEVE IT.

18:38.418 --> 18:39.886
OKAY, FRED,
GO HOME TO YOUR WIFE.

18:39.919 --> 18:44.324
GO WORK THIS THING OUT,
THE TWO OF YOU.

18:44.357 --> 18:47.160
WELL, THIS ISN'T VERY NEIGHBORLY
OF YOU, GEORGE.

18:47.194 --> 18:49.929
IT'S NOT VERY NEIGHBORLY AT ALL,

18:49.962 --> 18:52.265
SO LET'S JUST SEE WHAT HAPPENS
THE NEXT TIME

18:52.299 --> 18:55.702
YOU WANT TO BORROW MY RAKE,
SHALL WE?

18:58.671 --> 18:59.806
I HAVE A RAKE.

19:04.411 --> 19:05.678
I'M GONNA TRY
TO TRANSFER OUT.

19:05.712 --> 19:07.514
AFTER FAILING GYM,
I CAN'T REALLY AFFORD

19:07.547 --> 19:09.349
A "C" IN POETRY.
(spritzing)

19:09.382 --> 19:11.518
WOW. SO YOU'RE OFF
MS. EVANS, HUH?

19:11.551 --> 19:12.352
IT'S WEIRD.

19:12.385 --> 19:13.820
I DON'T KNOW WHAT MADE ME
SO DESPERATE

19:13.853 --> 19:16.456
FOR THE APPROVAL
OF A WITHHOLDING OLDER WOMAN

19:16.489 --> 19:19.759
WHO CLEAR WANTED NOTHING
TO DO WITH ME.

19:19.792 --> 19:22.362
YEAH.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.364
YEAH. NO. ME EITHER.

19:24.397 --> 19:26.766
YEAH.

19:26.799 --> 19:28.501
IT'S A PUZZLER.

19:28.535 --> 19:31.504
YEAH. NO, IT IS.
IT'S CURIOUS.

19:31.538 --> 19:33.406
MM-HMM.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.907
(door creaks open)

19:34.941 --> 19:37.344
FRED, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?
I HAVE BEEN WORRIED SICK.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.712
SHEILA, I NEED TO SPEAK
TO YOU PRIVATELY.

19:39.746 --> 19:42.682
I FAILED YOU. GEORGE WOULDN'T
AGREE TO MAKE LOVE TO YOU.

19:42.715 --> 19:46.853
I ASKED HIM, BUT HE DENIED ME.
HEY, TESSA. HELLO, LISA.

19:46.886 --> 19:48.755
WHAT IN GOD'S NAME
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

19:48.788 --> 19:51.424
GEORGE ALTMAN--
YOUR FANTASY.

19:51.458 --> 19:53.660
I'M ONLY SORRY I COULDN'T
MAKE HIM YOUR REALITY.

19:53.693 --> 19:54.861
HE WON'T HAVE INTERCOURSE
WITH YOU,

19:54.894 --> 19:56.229
WON'T EVEN CONSIDER IT.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.765
FRED, I AM NOT ATTRACTED
TO GEORGE ALTMAN.

19:58.798 --> 20:00.800
I COULDN'T BE LESS ATTRACTED
TO GEORGE ALTMAN.

20:00.833 --> 20:03.636
HE'S... UNKEMPT!

20:03.670 --> 20:06.406
THE GEORGE FROM MY DIARY
IS GEORGE STEPHANOPOULOS.

20:06.439 --> 20:08.775
THE LITTLE GREEK MAN
FROM "GOOD MORNING AMERICA"?

20:08.808 --> 20:12.912
I LIKE A TIDY, PETITE MAN.
YOU KNOW THAT.

20:12.945 --> 20:14.747
(sighs) YOU COULDN'T
HAVE USED A LAST NAME?

20:14.781 --> 20:16.048
I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO SPELL HIS NAME.

20:16.082 --> 20:19.051
IT'S NOT MY FAULT.
IT'S A RIDICULOUS LAST NAME!

20:19.085 --> 20:21.288
OH, SHEILA SHAY-SHAY.

20:21.321 --> 20:22.755
(both laugh)

20:22.789 --> 20:24.056
(door closes)

20:24.090 --> 20:25.925
(TV playing indistinctly)

20:25.958 --> 20:28.928
WHERE'S GEORGE? I'VE GOT NEWS.
HE'S ABOUT TO DO
SOMETHING DRASTIC.

20:28.961 --> 20:33.633
I TRIED TO TALK HIM OUT OF IT,
BUT HE WOULDN'T LISTEN TO ME.

20:33.666 --> 20:36.002
(buzzing)

20:36.035 --> 20:38.771
JUST DO IT.

20:38.805 --> 20:40.072
WAIT!

20:40.106 --> 20:40.940
STOP.
(buzzing stops)

20:40.973 --> 20:43.410
TESSA, I LOVE IT, TOO,
BUT IT'S GOTTA GO,

20:43.443 --> 20:45.645
FOR EVERYONE'S GOOD.

20:45.678 --> 20:46.913
(sighs) I THINK
IT'S JUST TOO SEXY.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.681
DAD, SHEILA'S NOT OBSESSED
WITH YOU.

20:48.715 --> 20:51.651
SHE'S OBSESSED WITH THE GEORGE
FROM "GOOD MORNING AMERICA,"

20:51.684 --> 20:55.688
SO YOU MAY NOT BE THE CASANOVA
OF CHATSWIN AFTER ALL.

20:55.722 --> 20:56.856
OH.

20:59.058 --> 21:00.627
HI. WHAT'S--WHAT'S THIS?

21:00.660 --> 21:03.996
IT'S A BALL CARRIER
FOR YOU TO CARRY YOUR BALLS.

21:05.465 --> 21:06.299
"GEORGE-ASS"?

21:06.333 --> 21:08.335
OH, IT'S PRONOUNCED
"GEORGE-UHS."

21:08.368 --> 21:10.370
IT'S A COMBINATION
OF BOTH OUR NAMES,

21:10.403 --> 21:12.539
LIKE BENNIFER, BRANGELINA,
OR CeeLo.

21:12.572 --> 21:14.341
I-I THINK
HE'S JUST ONE GUY.

21:14.374 --> 21:16.075
HE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE.

21:16.108 --> 21:19.011
WELL... (sighs) IT'S TIME
TO MAKE IT OFFICIAL, GEORGE,

21:19.045 --> 21:21.581
SINCE WE'RE GONNA BE
PARTNERS AND ALL.

21:21.614 --> 21:22.749
SO ARE WE?

21:26.619 --> 21:27.754
(chuckles)
