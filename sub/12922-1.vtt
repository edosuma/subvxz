WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:04.074
Black Gold 2011

03:45.642 --> 03:47.059
Here are my conditions.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.812
Keep your friendship.

03:51.356 --> 03:52.481
And my son!

03:54.610 --> 03:57.153
This is a guarantee for both of us.

03:58.238 --> 03:59.447
As long as I keep...

03:59.615 --> 04:01.574
I do thee no war.

04:05.245 --> 04:07.663
But any two-edged sword.

04:08.040 --> 04:11.083
We can not make war with thee
.

04:12.461 --> 04:15.046
Your son will join us in peace.

04:15.923 --> 04:17.673
I will exalt him as a father,

04:17.841 --> 04:19.634
with my son Tarik

04:19.801 --> 04:21.844
and daughter Leyla.

04:23.513 --> 04:24.722
Corridor And Yellow?

04:28.226 --> 04:32.104
We should laugh at ourselves for we
be held this...

04:33.899 --> 04:35.650
This piece of sand.

04:37.569 --> 04:40.613
Whether a no man's land between us.

04:41.573 --> 04:42.949
No one will claim.

04:44.618 --> 04:46.619
God is my witness,

04:48.705 --> 04:49.455
I agree.

04:49.623 --> 04:51.874
God is our witness.

05:00.884 --> 05:01.592
Saleh

05:02.094 --> 05:05.054
never forget that you are my eldest son.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.890
You  inherit my throne.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.477
Defend the honor of our house.

05:18.276 --> 05:19.110
Auda!

05:21.446 --> 05:23.531
Crying is wasting water.

05:31.915 --> 05:35.209
Do not worry, sidi,
the time pass quickly.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.974
You could swear that he won.

05:50.600 --> 05:53.519
May all our enemies like him, Colonel.

06:34.311 --> 06:36.687
It is my sad duty to announce

06:37.981 --> 06:38.814
your mother

06:39.274 --> 06:40.858
Princess  Zamira,

06:43.153 --> 06:44.111
died.

07:17.270 --> 07:18.646
What hand?

07:27.280 --> 07:28.572
Leyla!

07:29.366 --> 07:30.658
Auda!

07:33.787 --> 07:34.912
You are there!

07:35.789 --> 07:37.456
What are you doing?

07:37.624 --> 07:39.875
Leyla said that our mothers are in heaven

07:40.043 --> 07:41.919
and they watch over us.

07:47.467 --> 07:48.175
Leyla!

07:50.053 --> 07:50.719
Princess

07:50.887 --> 07:53.430
you're too big to play with boys.

07:54.224 --> 07:55.683
Go back.

08:05.944 --> 08:07.278
Leyla, darling...

08:08.029 --> 08:08.904
Come.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.293
They need water.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.129
But they have  a well!

08:25.297 --> 08:27.631
Cholera has taken up residence there.

08:35.432 --> 08:37.265
This happens there in Paris?

08:38.309 --> 08:40.977
My wife would she died in Paris?

08:41.563 --> 08:42.897
No, Your Majesty.

08:43.063 --> 08:44.857
This happens to it in London?

08:45.442 --> 08:47.651
The last epidemic of cholera in London

08:47.819 --> 08:50.279
must date back one hundred years.

08:51.448 --> 08:52.990
Here we are?

08:53.241 --> 08:55.534
Hundred years behind the West?

08:56.411 --> 08:58.037
Rather miles,

08:58.455 --> 08:59.955
Your Majesty.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.250
Tarik, my son,

09:03.585 --> 09:06.837
there
worst curse of being a poor king?

09:08.506 --> 09:10.674
I can not grow anything.

09:11.843 --> 09:14.094
I can not ship.

09:14.763 --> 09:18.766
Not even to trade.
Who would come to Hobeika?

09:22.979 --> 09:24.063
The truth

09:24.231 --> 09:28.025
be Arab means being a servant
at the banquet of the world.

09:40.121 --> 09:42.414
This is called
House of Allah.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.917
The emptiness of sight.

09:48.672 --> 09:49.755
And this road?

09:50.382 --> 09:52.091
This is the North Road.

09:52.259 --> 09:54.218
To the south, there Hobeika.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.804
And due north Salmaah.

10:07.649 --> 10:08.857
My beautiful!

10:17.575 --> 10:19.451
Pleated eyes Why you?

10:20.328 --> 10:23.580
Hoping that one day
on a clear day, I perceive Salmaah.

10:24.082 --> 10:24.999
It's too far.

10:26.209 --> 10:27.918
It's strange, Saleh.

10:28.878 --> 10:29.586
What?

10:30.297 --> 10:32.881
I'm starting to forget what father looks like.

10:37.762 --> 10:38.929
At that.

10:39.347 --> 10:40.639
It looks like this.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.718
Stay away!

11:19.471 --> 11:21.221
Back! Not so close.

11:21.723 --> 11:23.682
Stand back, please.

11:25.477 --> 11:27.394
- And hospitality?
- At the infidels?

11:27.562 --> 11:29.772
That's for me to decide.

11:29.939 --> 11:30.981
Take him.

11:32.192 --> 11:33.776
I'm sorry, gentlemen.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.487
I Nesib,

11:36.654 --> 11:37.821
Sultan  Hobeika.

11:39.532 --> 11:41.450
Thurkettle Sat, Your Majesty.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.212
You are an artist, Mr. Thurkettle?

11:54.672 --> 11:55.714
No, sir.

11:55.882 --> 11:59.468
I work for a small company named
Texan Oil.

12:02.305 --> 12:04.973
There is no oil here, Mr.
Thurkettle.

12:05.141 --> 12:06.517
Nothing but sand,

12:07.727 --> 12:08.477
sun

12:09.020 --> 12:10.187
and wind.

12:11.439 --> 12:13.941
Half of the year,
it blows from the east.

12:14.109 --> 12:15.275
It's winter.

12:15.443 --> 12:17.569
The other half, it blows from the south.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.113
It's summer.

12:20.824 --> 12:22.408
I must contradict you.

12:23.785 --> 12:25.202
It...

12:25.370 --> 12:26.537
This is the black shale.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.748
There is no lack, here.

12:30.583 --> 12:33.669
It usually indicates the presence of oil.

12:34.045 --> 12:36.213
Feel it, Your Majesty.

12:36.548 --> 12:37.506
Go!

12:38.425 --> 12:39.925
It smells like what?

12:42.053 --> 12:42.761
Oil.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.848
The shale behaves like a sponge.

12:46.015 --> 12:47.975
And this is not any oil.

12:48.143 --> 12:50.310
Come back to it, Your Majesty.

12:50.478 --> 12:52.396
Is it a pungent or sweet?

12:55.567 --> 12:56.233
Douce.

12:56.776 --> 12:57.818
Exactly!

12:58.027 --> 13:00.654
From sweet light crude,
the best in the world.

13:01.614 --> 13:03.532
I would bet my last dollar

13:03.700 --> 13:05.576
you have one package.

13:08.037 --> 13:09.329
You'll be rich.

13:12.208 --> 13:12.958
Rich?

13:13.126 --> 13:14.793
Pretty damn rich.

13:19.591 --> 13:24.678
When you say "damn rich",
how rich it is?

13:26.181 --> 13:27.264
Your Majesty,

13:27.974 --> 13:29.308
a good well

13:29.476 --> 13:33.562
product  one hundred thousand barrels per day,
a dollar a barrel.

13:33.730 --> 13:36.565
365 days a year.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.489
More Money Than the King of England?

13:44.449 --> 13:45.991
The King of England, it has what?

13:46.159 --> 13:49.077
Green lawns and a wet hat.

13:54.083 --> 13:54.958
Tarik,

13:55.293 --> 13:57.419
who is it, Lindbergh?

13:58.129 --> 13:59.922
A guy from Texas.

14:00.089 --> 14:01.548
He said he found oil.

14:01.716 --> 14:02.591
True?

14:04.469 --> 14:07.137
Where exactly did you get that?

14:07.597 --> 14:10.182
Gianni, what's it called again?

14:10.892 --> 14:12.768
Corridor Yellow, Your Majesty.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.437
The Yellow Corridor.

14:23.029 --> 14:25.197
A blind man on his knees before God

14:25.406 --> 14:28.283
is happier seeing a lot of greed.

14:29.244 --> 14:30.744
The latter, like the Franks

14:31.246 --> 14:33.789
wants to quench his thirst with sand.

14:33.957 --> 14:35.666
- "... With sand."
- What does he say?

14:35.833 --> 14:38.710
What they say when the mail is monitored.

14:39.504 --> 14:42.339
But you recommended, my lazy friend
,

14:42.507 --> 14:44.424
to do some exercise.

14:44.592 --> 14:45.217
Stop!

14:46.386 --> 14:47.678
It's expensive, a book!

14:47.845 --> 14:48.971
Shake your booty!

14:49.138 --> 14:50.430
Give it to me.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.057
Go, little brother!

14:52.600 --> 14:53.725
But moving!

14:54.435 --> 14:56.728
You are a slow agonizing.

15:05.071 --> 15:07.823
- What is beautiful!
- Superb!

15:07.991 --> 15:08.907
Ibn Idris...

15:09.075 --> 15:11.660
Princess, we thought you intended.

15:12.078 --> 15:14.037
- Who said that?
- Everyone.

15:15.582 --> 15:17.374
This is what we'll see.

16:07.717 --> 16:10.469
In my arms, my friend!
I adore you!

16:12.764 --> 16:14.640
God be with you, Colonel.

16:15.224 --> 16:18.143
When you negotiate with Amar,
made him the offer.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.687
- But only as a last resort.
- Of course.

16:20.855 --> 16:22.022
Please

16:22.398 --> 16:23.899
let me go.

16:24.067 --> 16:26.360
On my honor, I will return.

16:26.527 --> 16:28.570
My father would force me.

16:29.072 --> 16:30.530
But I need you here.

16:31.032 --> 16:32.032
Why?

16:32.200 --> 16:33.325
For falconry?

16:33.493 --> 16:34.910
Have patience.

16:35.078 --> 16:37.412
You will see again soon Salmaah.

16:38.873 --> 16:41.416
Do not come back once the agreement.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.422
Colonel... wait!

16:51.344 --> 16:54.429
Tell my father that I'm exercising...

16:57.517 --> 16:58.809
I will not fail.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.656
The name of Allah, the Merciful...

17:45.398 --> 17:46.523
Next!

17:49.235 --> 17:50.235
Mr. Minister.

17:53.489 --> 17:55.198
- And the scissors?
- Lost, Emir.

18:11.716 --> 18:12.883
Thank you, father.

18:37.074 --> 18:37.616
Auda!

18:38.576 --> 18:39.951
To you the honor.

18:41.954 --> 18:42.996
Go.

18:45.374 --> 18:46.875
Here...

18:47.126 --> 18:48.794
Auda, I know

18:48.961 --> 18:51.213
much you love the books.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.881
Do not you?

18:53.299 --> 18:55.175
I officially appoint you

18:55.343 --> 18:57.886
Librarian of the Kingdom.

18:58.054 --> 18:58.720
Approach.

19:02.141 --> 19:03.934
He's happy? Yes!

19:04.602 --> 19:05.977
Well, well.

19:06.604 --> 19:08.647
And here is your office.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.274
Go!

19:16.030 --> 19:17.781
Sit there.

19:19.283 --> 19:21.201
Gentlemen, please...

19:28.584 --> 19:31.670
That's how we ended the day in the South,

19:31.838 --> 19:33.505
with a good old bourbon.

19:34.799 --> 19:37.300
- Cheers!
- The best liquid in the world.

19:39.011 --> 19:40.011
It is rich.

19:41.889 --> 19:44.266
For the lucky  biggest desert!

19:49.397 --> 19:51.815
Take up this stuff, fast!

20:07.248 --> 20:09.416
They have weighted the feet

20:09.584 --> 20:12.335
and threw them in the tank for
literally

20:12.712 --> 20:14.546
they are full of oil.

20:14.714 --> 20:17.340
Are suspected Al Talabyns
or Anizas.

20:35.610 --> 20:37.569
I do not reign over a country.

20:38.112 --> 20:40.030
I reign on a mosaic

20:40.197 --> 20:44.075
tribes, people...
Deeply conservative.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.535
They do not like oil?

20:47.330 --> 20:50.999
They are in ever using that for their camels
,

20:51.459 --> 20:54.127
in poultices, against scabies.

20:55.713 --> 20:56.254
But...

20:56.839 --> 20:58.965
I'll beat the drum

20:59.133 --> 21:02.469
and "see" while their sliding
gold in the pocket.

21:03.387 --> 21:06.806
I will act so that your people are protected.

21:06.974 --> 21:08.224
Maybe

21:08.392 --> 21:11.311
would it take to launch the operation

21:11.479 --> 21:12.979
Corridor  Yellow.

21:16.359 --> 21:17.776
I should wait

21:18.194 --> 21:19.945
next cholera epidemic?

21:20.196 --> 21:21.821
The next woman

21:21.989 --> 21:24.199
died in childbirth, like mine?

21:26.202 --> 21:29.037
Our people need the oil money

21:29.205 --> 21:30.372
now!

21:55.356 --> 21:58.233
The envoys are back.
We return to Hobeika.

22:01.779 --> 22:03.279
Auda, the delegation!

22:04.407 --> 22:06.408
She came back. We will return.

22:06.575 --> 22:07.909
Finally, I hope.

22:09.161 --> 22:10.245
Look.

22:11.330 --> 22:12.330
Quick!

22:18.087 --> 22:19.170
They look exhausted.

22:20.840 --> 22:22.215
Provided they have succeeded!

22:24.844 --> 22:25.677
What did he say?

22:25.845 --> 22:27.804
He repeated week after week:

22:27.972 --> 22:30.640
"I gave my word and my son
to this treaty

22:30.808 --> 22:32.726
" passed under the eyes of God.

22:32.893 --> 22:35.603
"Why withdraw?"

22:35.771 --> 22:37.022
You did say it

22:37.189 --> 22:40.108
That
oil wealth is a gift from Allah?

22:40.860 --> 22:43.570
It seemed the opposite view.

22:43.738 --> 22:45.655
The Sultan would like to point

22:45.823 --> 22:48.450
considers that the operation of the Corridor

22:48.617 --> 22:50.201
as a violation of the Treaty.

22:51.746 --> 22:54.205
If Amar wants war, he will!

22:59.253 --> 23:01.588
I'll join father.
Not a word.

23:01.756 --> 23:03.131
Declare war.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.258
These lands are ours!

23:12.099 --> 23:13.725
Let's go, gentlemen.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.101
Encore!

23:15.269 --> 23:16.269
We just got back.

23:16.645 --> 23:17.937
No laziness!

23:18.105 --> 23:19.856
This is the hunting season.

23:23.736 --> 23:26.780
It only negotiate.
Offer him more.

23:26.947 --> 23:29.407
I already tried, Mr. Thurkettle,

23:29.575 --> 23:32.285
but said that money has no value.

23:32.620 --> 23:34.037
Never heard of it.

23:34.205 --> 23:36.623
You offered to return her son?

23:36.791 --> 23:38.792
Of course, following your instructions.

23:42.505 --> 23:44.672
My dear boy, come over here.

23:44.840 --> 23:46.633
We live in difficult times,

23:46.801 --> 23:48.968
but we will find a solution.

23:49.845 --> 23:50.887
Where is your brother?

23:51.764 --> 23:54.474
I think it was a little disappointed.

23:55.059 --> 23:57.352
So he went out to...

23:57.520 --> 23:58.353
Get some air.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.065
My beautiful...

24:02.233 --> 24:03.316
Fly away!

24:07.655 --> 24:09.322
How beautiful!

24:18.040 --> 24:19.207
Please, no!

24:38.310 --> 24:41.020
Auda was necessarily aware.

24:41.188 --> 24:43.356
It is an accomplice to this heinous crime.

25:23.647 --> 25:26.733
You've always been a brother to me,
anyway.

25:33.240 --> 25:37.535
It is said that every man
has three tasks to accomplish in this world.

25:37.870 --> 25:40.246
Plant a palm tree, dig a well

25:40.414 --> 25:42.165
and beget a son.

25:42.875 --> 25:45.543
Have you ever done one of them?

25:46.712 --> 25:47.921
I'll allow,

25:48.088 --> 25:49.631
with the blessing of Allah,

25:50.174 --> 25:52.884
Start with the easiest of the three.

26:06.857 --> 26:08.942
Instead of judging

26:09.109 --> 26:11.486
the remaining hostage, Auda,

26:11.654 --> 26:14.822
brother of the infamous murderer Saleh

26:15.366 --> 26:16.282
Nesib,

26:16.450 --> 26:17.909
king of Hobeika

26:18.077 --> 26:20.411
supreme commander of the southern tribes ,

26:20.579 --> 26:23.831
a gesture of extraordinary clemency

26:23.999 --> 26:27.085
saw fit to adopt Auda

26:27.253 --> 26:28.920
within his own family

26:29.088 --> 26:32.340
and offer him by the sacred bonds of marriage

26:32.508 --> 26:35.134
his daughter, Princess Leyla.

26:35.970 --> 26:37.303
Sign here.

26:47.147 --> 26:48.147
Sign!

26:57.908 --> 27:02.495
I declare the
previous treaty between the house of Amar

27:02.663 --> 27:04.497
and the house of Nesib

27:04.665 --> 27:06.040
null and void.

27:07.501 --> 27:08.751
Let us recite Al Fatiha.

27:24.727 --> 27:25.393
Go!

27:27.688 --> 27:28.771
It is here!

27:54.173 --> 27:56.591
Here is a token of my gratitude.

27:57.092 --> 27:58.926
They come from a place called...

27:59.094 --> 28:00.928
Switzerland!

28:02.222 --> 28:03.890
- Dear Friend!
- King Nesib...

28:04.058 --> 28:06.976
All Beni Sirris are proud to be at your side.

28:08.062 --> 28:10.313
They are welcome in my house.

28:12.524 --> 28:13.483
For you.

28:13.650 --> 28:15.568
I have exactly the same.

28:15.736 --> 28:17.737
Now we are brothers.

28:17.905 --> 28:18.905
Do not forget.

28:19.281 --> 28:20.365
Brothers!

28:51.855 --> 28:53.064
It's been how long?

28:54.149 --> 28:55.108
11 years.

28:55.442 --> 28:57.068
Do you remember!

28:59.738 --> 29:01.447
You were so surprising,

29:02.741 --> 29:04.784
as a boy out of a book.

29:09.790 --> 29:12.750
Do you see what I look like today?

29:16.046 --> 29:18.131
You have the right to take off my veil.

29:31.937 --> 29:33.855
I made do

29:34.440 --> 29:37.108
a Bedouin costume for you.

29:43.615 --> 29:45.032
Do not you like it?

29:45.909 --> 29:47.994
I never thought you...

29:49.121 --> 29:50.371
Would become so beautiful.

30:06.096 --> 30:09.140
Princess,
do not you see that it's a trap?

30:09.725 --> 30:10.725
A trap?

30:10.893 --> 30:12.018
How so?

30:12.686 --> 30:15.146
If your father wants  get married,

30:15.314 --> 30:17.690
is to destroy my hostage status

30:17.858 --> 30:19.901
and make war with mine.

30:20.777 --> 30:22.195
It was not a marriage,

30:22.362 --> 30:24.405
but a declaration of war.

30:26.450 --> 30:28.409
I could have gone to Salmaah.

30:29.328 --> 30:30.661
I should have gone

30:30.996 --> 30:32.788
Nesib as envoy.

30:34.416 --> 30:37.293
Who better than I could talk to my dad?

30:37.586 --> 30:39.170
Why no one thought?

30:39.630 --> 30:41.297
Because nobody sees me.

30:41.924 --> 30:43.424
And if we marry,

30:43.926 --> 30:45.676
we can no longer negotiate.

30:46.178 --> 30:48.346
Do we not already married?

30:50.891 --> 30:53.184
Strictly speaking, not yet.

31:01.318 --> 31:03.819
All this is only vulgar politics.

31:06.698 --> 31:08.491
So, all these years

31:08.700 --> 31:11.035
to spy on you through the moucharabiehs

31:11.203 --> 31:14.497
when you came home from the library, with books,

31:15.207 --> 31:18.084
Look so wise and so serious...

31:19.545 --> 31:21.212
It was the policy?

31:22.422 --> 31:24.882
You were promised to Ibn Idris.

31:27.386 --> 31:30.096
I was promised to no man.

31:30.264 --> 31:32.098
I went to see my father

31:32.266 --> 31:34.642
and I chose you, you.

31:36.144 --> 31:37.395
I?

31:39.106 --> 31:40.356
Saleh Why not?

31:42.317 --> 31:44.235
For you, it's a good brother.

31:45.571 --> 31:50.199
For me, it's just a prince
with a hawk and love of the past.

31:52.160 --> 31:53.202
Come see.

31:53.412 --> 31:56.372
My mother looked out the window

31:56.832 --> 31:58.291
and did she see?

32:00.836 --> 32:03.170
An unchanging world.

32:06.800 --> 32:08.050
But you,

32:08.969 --> 32:11.470
you are intelligent and sensitive.

32:13.056 --> 32:15.016
Do not worry, Prince Auda.

32:15.475 --> 32:16.559
Look

32:16.852 --> 32:18.185
you're in the harem.

32:19.688 --> 32:21.731
This is the only place on earth

32:22.482 --> 32:24.483
where we have the right

32:24.651 --> 32:26.402
to unveil.

32:52.638 --> 32:54.680
Alikoum Salam Ibn Idris.

32:56.183 --> 32:57.183
Alikoum salam.

32:57.893 --> 33:00.519
So you have exhausted all your balls
?

33:00.854 --> 33:02.563
Nesib living wills.

33:03.065 --> 33:05.775
He promised to pay blood money.

33:05.984 --> 33:07.360
Let simple.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.738
The guards you killed my cousins ​​were
.

33:11.031 --> 33:14.617
You can not shoot me, Ibn Idris.
I am a prince.

33:16.119 --> 33:17.286
You were a prince.

33:59.746 --> 34:01.122
Saleh died.

34:02.624 --> 34:03.290
What?

34:04.084 --> 34:06.419
It would never have left.

34:06.586 --> 34:07.586
Never.

35:05.020 --> 35:06.228
Hello, Father.

35:06.396 --> 35:07.938
The apple of my eye!

35:09.816 --> 35:11.150
Are you?

35:11.902 --> 35:13.152
If I'm fine?

35:16.656 --> 35:18.908
Why did you not with your husband?

35:21.077 --> 35:22.995
Te has he dishonored?

35:24.206 --> 35:26.165
Would it not...

35:26.333 --> 35:28.083
The purpose of a wedding night?

35:29.044 --> 35:31.295
None. It is the gentlest of men.

35:33.548 --> 35:35.591
Can I ask you a question?

35:39.221 --> 35:40.471
Saleh is dead?

35:57.447 --> 35:59.365
Father, hold.

36:01.368 --> 36:03.494
You
I never asked a favor?

36:04.621 --> 36:06.121
All the time.

36:06.832 --> 36:11.168
Sometimes I tell myself that God put me on
earth just for that.

36:17.384 --> 36:18.175
What do you want?

36:21.054 --> 36:22.888
I thought.

36:23.932 --> 36:26.475
We thought.

36:28.061 --> 36:29.937
What a blessing for us

36:30.689 --> 36:32.690
to have under our roof

36:32.858 --> 36:35.401
the son of two fathers.

36:38.947 --> 36:40.531
Should I not myself

36:40.699 --> 36:43.784
peace-loving father,

36:44.369 --> 36:46.453
send this son

36:46.621 --> 36:48.539
father who seems to

36:48.790 --> 36:50.541
blinded by the war?

36:51.126 --> 36:54.128
To remind the pious man

36:54.421 --> 36:56.297
in the Holy Quran

36:56.464 --> 36:57.798
the word "peace"

36:57.966 --> 37:00.050
returns twice

37:00.218 --> 37:01.677
that the word "war"?

37:12.939 --> 37:15.399
You are the emissary of Hobeika

37:15.692 --> 37:17.234
but above all...

37:17.819 --> 37:18.944
You are my son

37:20.405 --> 37:22.197
and married to Leyla.

37:27.078 --> 37:29.246
I have not finished yet!

37:33.752 --> 37:35.210
Tell Amar

37:35.378 --> 37:37.338
I do not seek conflict,

37:37.505 --> 37:39.465
but I did not shirk.

37:39.633 --> 37:41.091
And this time...

37:43.094 --> 37:44.303
They are with me.

37:45.931 --> 37:47.348
Go, now.

37:55.815 --> 38:00.444
My daughter
request permission to accompany her husband to the door.

38:01.154 --> 38:03.906
It is never
mounted in an automobile.

40:38.686 --> 40:40.979
Do you remember these places?

40:43.066 --> 40:43.982
Not really.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.537
Monsignor...

40:56.704 --> 40:58.539
Your son is here.

41:23.565 --> 41:24.439
Saleh?

41:25.400 --> 41:27.901
In fact, it was Auda... father.

41:29.946 --> 41:31.446
Peace be with you.

41:31.614 --> 41:33.907
Auda, of course.

41:38.538 --> 41:41.081
Forgive me, too many years have passed.

41:43.751 --> 41:44.835
Fifteen.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.336
That much?

41:49.299 --> 41:51.008
You became a man.

41:52.135 --> 41:53.594
Thank God.

41:57.015 --> 41:57.890
Where is Saleh?

42:02.061 --> 42:03.395
It is no longer with us.

42:04.689 --> 42:06.064
Why? Where is he?

42:08.651 --> 42:10.319
He entered the grace of Allah.

42:14.407 --> 42:17.576
He killed his guard and was shot.

42:19.704 --> 42:21.371
He killed his guard?

42:21.581 --> 42:24.625
He ​​fled to the return of the delegation.

42:27.921 --> 42:30.005
And not you, obviously.

42:33.718 --> 42:35.886
I come here as an emissary.

42:37.889 --> 42:38.931
The emissary who?

42:39.891 --> 42:42.643
Envoy of peace, I hope.

42:43.561 --> 42:45.896
Nesib With soldiers?

42:47.065 --> 42:48.440
In a car infidels?

42:48.816 --> 42:51.860
Amir, it was faster.

42:54.113 --> 42:56.865
And his advisers speak in your place.

42:57.033 --> 42:59.284
Your houses are now united.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.328
Auda?

43:02.789 --> 43:05.082
I married Leyla.

43:09.045 --> 43:13.257
You married the daughter of
Nesib for being murdered your brother?

43:15.176 --> 43:16.843
Let me explain.

43:17.011 --> 43:18.262
You explain to.

43:18.888 --> 43:20.097
Do not doubt it.

43:22.392 --> 43:25.102
But these people return to Hobeika.

43:26.729 --> 43:31.149
My sense of hospitality does not extend
murderers of my son.

43:40.535 --> 43:42.077
Forgive me, Princess.

43:43.496 --> 43:44.871
It's nothing.

43:48.334 --> 43:49.209
Latifa

43:51.004 --> 43:53.505
something that speaks of love.

44:17.405 --> 44:20.866
Do you think we would have killed you
if you had refused the marriage?

44:22.118 --> 44:25.203
Some might suggest to Nesib

44:25.580 --> 44:28.707
that I would leave remove a freer hand.

44:29.751 --> 44:32.336
Then, according to the principle of Al Takeyya,

44:32.503 --> 44:36.757
which permits a Muslim to hide
if he thinks his life is threatened,

44:36.924 --> 44:38.342
you are absolved.

44:39.802 --> 44:41.303
You must free a slave,

44:41.471 --> 44:44.014
or, if you can not do,

44:44.182 --> 44:46.892
fast three days and say three times:

44:47.060 --> 44:49.978
"I divorce you, Leyla
, daughter of Nesib"

44:50.146 --> 44:51.438
and you will be issued.

44:52.023 --> 44:53.398
Thanks for the advice.

44:57.987 --> 45:00.447
You say come as an emissary of peace.

45:02.867 --> 45:04.409
The term is a misnomer.

45:04.577 --> 45:05.744
Indeed.

45:06.621 --> 45:09.414
For it is we who are abused,

45:10.291 --> 45:12.626
while we remained peaceful.

45:13.252 --> 45:14.628
army was ready.

45:14.796 --> 45:17.339
Tribes Vengeance shouting,
but I waited.

45:18.007 --> 45:19.007
Why?

45:19.842 --> 45:21.218
To keep his word.

45:21.803 --> 45:24.346
Corridor belongs to no one.

45:24.514 --> 45:27.224
But now you are free to act.

45:27.392 --> 45:29.309
This war is the cause of God!

45:34.023 --> 45:35.524
Can I speak?

45:36.275 --> 45:38.777
Listen my son!

45:40.822 --> 45:43.865
My father always recommended to read the Koran
.

45:44.992 --> 45:48.203
I am surprised that people of faith gathered here

45:48.371 --> 45:50.205
any call to war

45:50.373 --> 45:52.666
while the holy book condemns the
.

45:53.042 --> 45:54.459
Sura 2, Emir

45:54.627 --> 45:58.088
enjoins us to defend ourselves against the infidels.

45:59.757 --> 46:02.217
It allows you to defend yourself

46:02.385 --> 46:05.095
against the unbelievers who want your loss.

46:05.263 --> 46:07.347
Precisely, these foreigners

46:07.515 --> 46:08.932
want our loss.

46:09.100 --> 46:11.184
How? Were you threatened?

46:12.061 --> 46:15.939
Unbelievers may be a threat to Muslims.

46:16.107 --> 46:17.232
For Muslims!

46:17.400 --> 46:18.942
"Be not a friend

46:19.110 --> 46:22.362
" to anyone who is not
your people. "

46:23.197 --> 46:26.241
Oil is unholy because it links us to the infidels.

46:26.409 --> 46:28.118
You totally reject?

46:28.494 --> 46:31.413
It operates
vehicles unbelievers.

46:33.082 --> 46:35.000
What are our vehicles?

46:35.418 --> 46:37.586
- Camels.
- of course!

46:38.004 --> 46:39.421
We have camels!

46:39.589 --> 46:41.047
I have a question.

46:42.425 --> 46:46.803
If oil is not for us,
why Allah did it take us?

46:47.054 --> 46:49.598
If wanted us to serve,

46:49.765 --> 46:51.141
Quran would say.

46:51.309 --> 46:52.809
The Qur'an would say!

46:52.977 --> 46:55.187
He has not forbidden in the Koran.

46:55.438 --> 46:57.814
I think he put in the ground

46:57.982 --> 46:59.691
to improve our lives.

46:59.859 --> 47:02.319
What counts, that's life eternal.

47:02.487 --> 47:04.863
We do not have to improve life on earth.

47:05.239 --> 47:07.115
This is a temporary enjoyment.

47:07.283 --> 47:08.783
A temporary enjoyment!

47:08.951 --> 47:10.744
And your glasses, it is a sin?

47:11.871 --> 47:13.079
They improve your life.

47:13.456 --> 47:14.372
No, Emir.

47:14.540 --> 47:17.125
They allow me to see the words

47:17.293 --> 47:19.419
the Holy Qur'an more clearly.

47:21.797 --> 47:22.964
Listen to me!

47:23.174 --> 47:25.884
The enemy are apostates.

47:26.052 --> 47:26.968
Do you hear?

47:41.484 --> 47:43.443
Hello. You are alone.

47:43.611 --> 47:46.029
Unfortunately, yes.

47:46.364 --> 47:49.115
I'm sorry.
The king kept his son Amar.

47:49.283 --> 47:53.453
Auda remained for further discussion.

47:54.121 --> 47:57.749
Ibn Idris ,
can I count on your support?

48:06.634 --> 48:09.553
Do you remember how you taught me to pray?

48:11.514 --> 48:14.015
I was not higher than your sword.

48:15.851 --> 48:17.060
Tell me.

48:17.353 --> 48:19.062
Was I wrong to come here?

48:19.814 --> 48:23.233
The fate made my profession of war, Sidi.

48:23.401 --> 48:27.237
But in truth,
I have never seen anyone win.

48:30.575 --> 48:31.741
Enter.

48:36.122 --> 48:37.497
Good evening, Doctor.

48:39.292 --> 48:40.750
I'm very badly.

48:42.461 --> 48:46.423
Tell me about your symptoms
it a little less vague.

48:47.550 --> 48:49.384
I have a high fever,

48:49.885 --> 48:51.761
my heart beats a hundred miles an hour

48:52.013 --> 48:54.889
and it looks like my head will explode.

48:56.350 --> 48:57.809
Replace your sleeve.

49:11.365 --> 49:13.283
I know what you have.

49:13.659 --> 49:14.909
A cigarette?

49:15.453 --> 49:17.996
You make an attack of hypochondria.

49:18.581 --> 49:19.247
Not at all.

49:19.415 --> 49:23.835
, if it is in the head,
but do a little exercise.

49:24.337 --> 49:26.087
I really really bad.

49:26.714 --> 49:28.131
Somatization.

49:28.382 --> 49:29.841
Your mind is agitated.

49:30.009 --> 49:32.802
If you are calm, you are better.

49:32.970 --> 49:34.220
And this is so,

49:39.143 --> 49:41.603
Modern medicine is prohibited here.

49:43.230 --> 49:45.273
The drugs are banned?

49:45.566 --> 49:46.775
Why?

49:48.235 --> 49:50.904
Why?
It's coming from abroad.

49:51.072 --> 49:52.614
This is the work of the devil.

49:53.032 --> 49:56.701
This is the venerable theologians say
Sultan.

49:56.952 --> 49:58.912
You've seen them, I think.

49:59.789 --> 50:03.500
They just forgot that the Prophet himself said:

50:03.668 --> 50:05.669
"Use medicine.

50:06.045 --> 50:09.464
" Allah has created no disease without
provide the remedy. "

50:09.965 --> 50:11.299
Unless old age .

50:11.467 --> 50:13.718
The Sultan has swallowed the Koran at once.

50:14.053 --> 50:15.845
At his age, is digested poorly.

50:16.555 --> 50:17.806
Good luck to you.

50:18.516 --> 50:19.933
Wait, doctor.

50:21.185 --> 50:22.894
What is your name?

50:24.939 --> 50:26.189
Ali.

50:28.067 --> 50:29.275
Ibn Ali Amar.

50:31.112 --> 50:32.779
The unloved son of the Sultan.

50:34.365 --> 50:36.074
And his favorite scapegoat.

50:38.953 --> 50:40.453
We are brothers?

50:40.621 --> 50:42.789
The disease has not affected your judgment.

50:42.957 --> 50:44.374
Yes, different mothers.

50:44.709 --> 50:46.251
Mine was more beautiful.

50:46.794 --> 50:48.169
Our father would say

50:48.337 --> 50:50.505
he did more than you, Saleh died
,

50:51.215 --> 50:53.925
ascended into heaven, among the virgins.

50:54.093 --> 50:56.678
I do not count.
All you will return.

50:57.138 --> 50:58.388
Do not slam it.

50:58.556 --> 51:00.181
Why you do not count?

51:04.061 --> 51:06.438
Because I have opinions.

51:07.273 --> 51:09.065
This is frowned upon in Salmaah.

51:09.233 --> 51:10.900
We must obey blindly.

51:11.694 --> 51:14.487
Beware of our father, the only leader

51:14.655 --> 51:16.656
who prefers to be poor.

51:17.199 --> 51:19.200
It has a strange seduction.

51:32.590 --> 51:34.257
You have spoken well, yesterday.

51:35.926 --> 51:39.471
I have lost the habit
to hear the voice of youth.

51:40.389 --> 51:44.184
I've dropped too soon, you and Saleh
. Come.

52:01.118 --> 52:02.786
Father, I must know.

52:07.374 --> 52:10.210
Nesib offered you send us.

52:11.378 --> 52:12.921
Why did you refuse?

52:14.673 --> 52:16.007
I'll tell you.

52:17.134 --> 52:21.429
Accountants Nesib offered me 5%
revenue Corridor.

52:21.597 --> 52:22.931
I refused.

52:24.141 --> 52:26.893
On reaching 32%, they suggested...

52:27.895 --> 52:30.897
Already how...
Include you in the lot.

52:32.149 --> 52:33.191
Only...

52:34.276 --> 52:39.072
When I got defeated,
15 years ago by telling your mother

52:39.615 --> 52:42.450
I'd have let you hostage,

52:45.538 --> 52:48.289
it was like a bird

52:49.416 --> 52:51.209
who no longer wants to sing.

52:52.753 --> 52:56.548
She retired to her room,
turned to the wall...

52:57.675 --> 52:59.592
She died six weeks.

53:00.594 --> 53:03.847
Your life was priceless for her.
Not for me.

53:04.473 --> 53:06.432
He assigned a value

53:07.059 --> 53:09.769
would dishonor his memory.

53:12.606 --> 53:14.232
Know, my son,

53:15.150 --> 53:18.486
that everything you see in this room

53:18.988 --> 53:22.490
was conquered by blood or by love.

53:23.242 --> 53:24.492
Not by money.

53:25.160 --> 53:27.161
What can be purchased

53:27.746 --> 53:29.330
has no real value.

53:34.253 --> 53:36.254
I came to warn you.

53:36.964 --> 53:38.423
Nesib has a powerful army,

53:38.757 --> 53:41.718
on the North Road,
with modern weapons.

53:42.094 --> 53:45.388
His fortune swells visibly
and he rallied the southern tribes.

53:46.599 --> 53:50.101
Poor , he had money for guns
.

53:51.812 --> 53:55.148
The one who believes only weapons
is a poor soldier.

53:56.317 --> 53:57.859
As for the southern tribes,

53:58.027 --> 54:00.695
they are quicker to celebrate a wedding

54:00.863 --> 54:03.406
to choose sides in the war.

54:04.366 --> 54:06.618
By the way, I was...

54:07.036 --> 54:09.287
This when you were young.

54:09.455 --> 54:10.747
Do you remember?

54:11.498 --> 54:13.041
I told you

54:13.208 --> 54:15.835
I saw the inside of your soul.

54:16.629 --> 54:18.588
Tell me the truth.

54:20.633 --> 54:22.550
Want to repudiate the marriage?

54:29.558 --> 54:30.433
None.

54:33.354 --> 54:34.687
I like it.

54:36.023 --> 54:37.190
Really.

54:37.399 --> 54:38.942
You know, my son,

54:40.903 --> 54:44.572
the greatest gift in the life of a man, is love.

54:49.119 --> 54:49.827
Hassan!

54:53.582 --> 54:54.248
Yes, Emir.

54:54.750 --> 54:56.209
Go to  Hobeika.

54:56.543 --> 54:59.837
Nesib Tell my son has softened my heart.

55:00.965 --> 55:02.882
To celebrate the union of our houses,

55:03.217 --> 55:06.552
I propose to meet in peace
at new moon.

55:17.022 --> 55:19.023
Father, yesterday, the doctor said...

55:20.359 --> 55:21.901
This is a bitter man,

55:22.444 --> 55:23.569
a buffoon.

55:24.780 --> 55:26.531
He said my brother.

55:27.866 --> 55:30.118
All rivers have their tributaries.

55:44.717 --> 55:48.720
Given the recent union between your two houses
,

55:48.887 --> 55:52.765
King Amar
forgive you of your right to be unduly

55:52.933 --> 55:54.308
Yellow Corridor.

56:04.486 --> 56:05.653
That's it?

56:05.821 --> 56:08.865
He wants to return to the original agreement

56:09.408 --> 56:11.325
passed before God,

56:11.493 --> 56:15.580
Corridor stating that belongs neither to him nor you.

56:17.332 --> 56:18.416
You finished?

56:18.584 --> 56:20.460
No, His Majesty added

56:20.836 --> 56:24.297
when the infidels have packed up,

56:25.132 --> 56:28.468
she will be happy to attend
wedding festivities

56:28.802 --> 56:30.762
Which  inadvertently

56:31.305 --> 56:33.139
you neglected to invite him.

56:33.432 --> 56:34.432
Okay.

56:38.437 --> 56:39.896
I've beaten,

56:40.522 --> 56:42.190
Hassan Dakhil,

56:43.901 --> 56:46.527
you and your master.

56:47.446 --> 56:48.863
I should have ended.

56:50.282 --> 56:52.408
Thank you, Your Majesty.

56:58.499 --> 56:59.832
Hassan Dakhil...

57:01.126 --> 57:03.336
Sit down a moment.

57:12.805 --> 57:14.055
You are a professional.

57:15.224 --> 57:16.974
You know that this war

57:17.226 --> 57:20.269
to summarize in three words
to the house of Amar.

57:22.356 --> 57:23.606
Absurd.

57:26.151 --> 57:27.360
Cruel.

57:29.071 --> 57:30.238
And vain.

57:33.909 --> 57:35.076
So...

58:40.225 --> 58:43.227
You will build a wall
midst of your land.

58:43.395 --> 58:46.147
In return, I give
a sheep each.

58:47.733 --> 58:50.943
They came to see me too, these Texans.

58:51.486 --> 58:55.323
With their boots, their hats and their voices thundering
.

58:55.490 --> 58:57.533
They spoke only of money.

59:04.791 --> 59:06.542
But I told them:

59:06.710 --> 59:09.170
"What can I make money?

59:12.841 --> 59:14.508
" I have been blessed a thousand times. "

59:17.638 --> 59:19.055
" My beloved wife,

59:19.223 --> 59:21.349
"As you have understood,

59:21.516 --> 59:24.268
"father is fully committed to peace.

59:24.645 --> 59:26.938
"This is the truest of men.

59:27.105 --> 59:29.190
" I look forward to introduce you.

59:29.358 --> 59:31.692
"
We should live half the year Salmaah

59:31.860 --> 59:33.945
" and the other Hobeika. "

59:52.965 --> 59:53.673
Where is Hassan?

59:54.007 --> 59:57.677
It remains to Hobeika.
For an indefinite period.

59:58.720 --> 01:00:00.346
"for health reasons."

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:03.516
He bought it.

01:00:04.977 --> 01:00:06.727
Nesib bought Hassan

01:00:07.604 --> 01:00:09.272
and killed Saleh.

01:00:13.527 --> 01:00:17.446
The
truth and courage were the stars that guided us.

01:00:17.906 --> 01:00:20.408
Today
oil and money is king.

01:00:47.144 --> 01:00:49.020
Who are these men, father?

01:00:49.438 --> 01:00:50.855
I aerate my prisons.

01:00:51.189 --> 01:00:52.690
It is their year.

01:01:10.375 --> 01:01:12.710
They, they'll get some exercise?

01:01:12.878 --> 01:01:15.921
Yes, this is my army of straw.

01:01:16.089 --> 01:01:19.842
Nesib It will distract while I will hit the heart.

01:01:21.762 --> 01:01:23.262
You know him well.

01:01:23.805 --> 01:01:24.972
What does he think of me?

01:01:26.558 --> 01:01:29.852
Whether you are honorable, but incorrigibly nostalgic
.

01:01:31.021 --> 01:01:32.271
antiquity!

01:01:36.234 --> 01:01:39.403
If he reported that I conduct my army in the desert

01:01:39.571 --> 01:01:41.697
to get through the House of God

01:01:42.074 --> 01:01:43.366
would believe it?

01:01:45.077 --> 01:01:47.328
Send these men in the House of God?

01:01:48.163 --> 01:01:49.205
They would die.

01:01:49.373 --> 01:01:52.083
Better to die for a noble cause

01:01:56.338 --> 01:01:57.338
The believe-it?

01:01:58.215 --> 01:01:59.507
Yes.

01:01:59.674 --> 01:02:02.301
He would think an attack
Yellow Corridor.

01:02:03.053 --> 01:02:05.304
An idea worthy of antiquity!

01:02:06.306 --> 01:02:09.058
withdraw its men from the North Road

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:11.185
to strengthen the Corridor?

01:02:12.854 --> 01:02:14.772
Yes...  probably.

01:02:15.065 --> 01:02:16.273
Exactly.

01:02:16.650 --> 01:02:20.027
And then I began the Northern Sea Route
to take Hobeika.

01:02:20.195 --> 01:02:23.155
But you can not
if you are in the desert

01:02:23.407 --> 01:02:24.782
in the House of God.

01:02:24.950 --> 01:02:25.574
None.

01:02:27.577 --> 01:02:28.536
But you, though.

01:02:29.496 --> 01:02:30.913
I what?

01:02:31.164 --> 01:02:33.124
You'll pass through the House of God.

01:02:33.959 --> 01:02:35.167
Not the cross,

01:02:35.627 --> 01:02:38.796
show you but to bring the army of Nesib.

01:02:39.423 --> 01:02:42.466
I was going to send Hassan,
you will take his place.

01:02:42.634 --> 01:02:43.717
This is absurd.

01:02:43.927 --> 01:02:47.555
I came to plead for peace, not replace your
General.

01:02:47.722 --> 01:02:50.641
You have it in my blood,
you are born to command.

01:02:52.602 --> 01:02:55.563
You are the future of Sultan
Citadel Salmaah,

01:02:56.690 --> 01:02:58.649
twelfth of the line.

01:02:59.943 --> 01:03:02.695
reign over these lands for centuries.

01:03:03.989 --> 01:03:06.615
Our ancestors were escorting the Prophet.

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:10.494
Once,
I used a firearm.

01:03:10.662 --> 01:03:12.663
I almost lost my shoulder.

01:03:13.874 --> 01:03:15.166
I read books.

01:03:15.333 --> 01:03:19.253
They tell me that my blood
is water, protein and iron.

01:03:19.421 --> 01:03:22.256
And if it contains something else, is the certainty

01:03:22.424 --> 01:03:24.884
you will lose this war as the previous
.

01:03:28.680 --> 01:03:30.264
I had you mistaken for another.

01:03:31.349 --> 01:03:32.933
Thank you for coming to Salmaah.

01:03:33.101 --> 01:03:36.145
You have found a better king and a better father

01:03:36.813 --> 01:03:38.147
in Nesib.

01:03:38.398 --> 01:03:40.816
We are at war, being found

01:03:40.984 --> 01:03:42.651
opulence of Hobeika

01:03:42.944 --> 01:03:44.945
and the arms of your wife.

01:03:48.450 --> 01:03:50.451
May God guide your steps.

01:04:45.715 --> 01:04:47.967
Do you fill the belly!

01:04:48.134 --> 01:04:49.593
This is the last well.

01:04:50.595 --> 01:04:54.890
The
last water point for two weeks to come.

01:04:55.225 --> 01:04:56.725
Do you fill the belly.

01:04:56.893 --> 01:04:58.644
Fill the bottles.

01:05:12.993 --> 01:05:15.452
Peace be with you, brother.

01:05:15.662 --> 01:05:18.831
And leprosy with you.
You were supposed to rest.

01:05:18.999 --> 01:05:19.873
What are you doing?

01:05:20.250 --> 01:05:21.542
You compresses?

01:05:22.877 --> 01:05:24.295
Not enough.

01:05:24.462 --> 01:05:27.381
But I've found a replacement in case of relapse
.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:29.925
No one will see the difference.

01:05:31.052 --> 01:05:33.846
So, what's the plan, General?

01:05:34.806 --> 01:05:37.766
I can not tell you if you do
're not.

01:05:39.185 --> 01:05:42.438
How could I be if
I do not know him?

01:05:43.481 --> 01:05:44.898
Dr. Ali!

01:05:46.735 --> 01:05:48.652
Sultan awaits you after the prayer.

01:05:58.913 --> 01:06:01.540
What a pleasure to see your highness!

01:06:01.875 --> 01:06:03.250
Or should I say "father"?

01:06:06.796 --> 01:06:08.422
You turn everything into ridicule.

01:06:09.799 --> 01:06:10.758
It's easier.

01:06:11.509 --> 01:06:14.261
- Easier?
- What to say what you feel.

01:06:16.514 --> 01:06:18.724
And what do you feel?

01:06:20.935 --> 01:06:23.562
I regret not being able

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:25.522
as you want.

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:33.614
Sit.

01:06:43.375 --> 01:06:44.917
I thought.

01:06:45.085 --> 01:06:49.004
If God disapproved of medicine,
He ​​would not put people like you

01:06:49.923 --> 01:06:51.215
on earth.

01:06:54.094 --> 01:06:56.595
So, perhaps, to your return,

01:06:56.763 --> 01:06:58.055
we will see your project.

01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:05.688
Thank you, father.

01:07:13.113 --> 01:07:14.822
I can count on you?

01:07:14.989 --> 01:07:15.698
Course.

01:07:16.783 --> 01:07:17.908
Watch over Auda.

01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:23.330
I expected to hate him.

01:07:24.416 --> 01:07:27.543
But no.
It reminds me of a young owl.

01:07:28.294 --> 01:07:30.671
He ​​just sees despite his myopic eyes.

01:08:23.933 --> 01:08:27.728
This fabric door
sweat and blood of our house.

01:08:29.397 --> 01:08:31.982
The head of our family wears

01:08:33.693 --> 01:08:35.652
since the time of the Prophet.

01:08:41.910 --> 01:08:42.993
In Be-worthy.

01:08:44.871 --> 01:08:46.371
I will do my best.

01:08:46.622 --> 01:08:47.915
Remember,

01:08:48.082 --> 01:08:51.627
'm just identify yourself by
Force Nesib. Useless...

01:08:51.795 --> 01:08:53.045
FOR contact.

01:08:53.837 --> 01:08:55.005
I know.

01:08:55.631 --> 01:08:57.758
No need to worry about that.

01:09:01.386 --> 01:09:02.470
Come.

01:09:34.629 --> 01:09:36.671
May God protect us all.

01:10:42.739 --> 01:10:44.531
Can we go that far?

01:10:44.991 --> 01:10:48.368
Our trucks allow us to strike anywhere.

01:10:49.329 --> 01:10:53.916
Anyway, it does not really cross the
House of Allah.

01:10:54.083 --> 01:10:56.043
Not with a conventional army.

01:10:56.377 --> 01:10:58.128
The thing is impossible.

01:10:58.630 --> 01:11:00.130
I know this region.

01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.175
It would break the bravest.

01:11:03.635 --> 01:11:07.971
Walk to the House of Allah
does not mean the cross.

01:11:16.856 --> 01:11:20.859
It has not rained here since the sky
mourned the death of the Prophet.

01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:23.528
This is the Door of demons, Emir

01:11:23.696 --> 01:11:25.447
the entrance to the house of Allah.

01:11:59.107 --> 01:12:02.109
"Father,
is a plane flew over us.

01:12:02.777 --> 01:12:05.278
" It did not necessarily seen.
We continue. "

01:12:19.335 --> 01:12:20.419
Hey you...

01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.587
Move!

01:13:02.170 --> 01:13:03.336
Loans to fire!

01:13:03.546 --> 01:13:04.838
- Ready!
- Amir, stay there.

01:13:05.006 --> 01:13:06.381
We want water !

01:13:08.426 --> 01:13:10.469
Back! Stay away!

01:13:10.636 --> 01:13:11.887
Do not shoot!

01:13:12.055 --> 01:13:12.888
Move back!

01:13:15.391 --> 01:13:16.725
We want water!

01:13:16.976 --> 01:13:19.811
This is not an extravagant claim
.

01:13:20.813 --> 01:13:22.105
Qu ' Is what it is?

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:23.273
Silence!

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:36.078
I know what it is. Armored.

01:13:36.496 --> 01:13:37.788
I'll talk to them.

01:13:40.333 --> 01:13:43.043
Do not do it, Emir. Come back!

01:13:48.299 --> 01:13:50.300
I am Prince Auda.

01:13:51.969 --> 01:13:53.678
It's me, Auda.

01:14:04.774 --> 01:14:06.691
On the dunes, fast!

01:14:07.610 --> 01:14:09.236
It will be safe, follow me.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.129
Jump on the slope!

01:14:43.896 --> 01:14:45.772
sand in deadly!

01:14:47.275 --> 01:14:48.733
It jammed.

01:15:22.810 --> 01:15:23.852
Aim  tires!

01:15:49.378 --> 01:15:51.254
Block the wheels with your clothes.

01:15:51.756 --> 01:15:52.923
With anything!

01:15:53.758 --> 01:15:55.008
What you can.

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:40.637
Victory!

01:16:42.014 --> 01:16:43.098
We got them.

01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:45.016
They were repulsed, Emir.

01:16:46.227 --> 01:16:47.644
I do not believe.

01:16:48.938 --> 01:16:50.772
They did not let go.

01:16:51.816 --> 01:16:53.483
They return to Hobeika.

01:16:53.859 --> 01:16:57.195
They will kill our Sultan
on the North Road.

01:16:59.490 --> 01:17:00.824
Do you want water?

01:17:09.208 --> 01:17:12.043
My commander, look there.

01:17:15.256 --> 01:17:16.464
Was your prince.

01:17:16.841 --> 01:17:18.383
We want to sell it.

01:17:18.968 --> 01:17:20.844
We do not ask much.

01:17:21.012 --> 01:17:22.137
A little water.

01:17:22.513 --> 01:17:23.888
You have not abused?

01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:27.809
Your little prince?
Why would it be?

01:17:27.977 --> 01:17:28.935
Come!

01:17:29.395 --> 01:17:30.645
That's enough.

01:17:36.610 --> 01:17:37.861
The gas can!

01:17:39.530 --> 01:17:40.655
Quick, the can!

01:17:46.245 --> 01:17:47.287
Hurry.

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:49.748
We crossed the Rubicon.

01:17:52.043 --> 01:17:53.209
Another !

01:17:55.755 --> 01:17:57.505
There's always something wrong.

01:17:57.715 --> 01:17:59.049
Give!

01:17:59.633 --> 01:18:00.800
They are close!

01:18:05.181 --> 01:18:06.598
It's coming.

01:18:06.766 --> 01:18:07.390
Here we go!

01:18:08.392 --> 01:18:09.559
My Beagle!

01:18:13.064 --> 01:18:14.189
Auda, home to yourself.

01:18:14.899 --> 01:18:16.358
Amir, fast!

01:18:18.027 --> 01:18:19.194
Get down.

01:19:03.989 --> 01:19:05.240
No message?

01:19:08.285 --> 01:19:10.578
God bless our dead heroes.

01:19:15.251 --> 01:19:17.210
Everyone in the saddle!

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:41.651
Help Us!

01:19:42.445 --> 01:19:43.778
Help!

01:20:16.312 --> 01:20:17.604
Now!

01:21:16.705 --> 01:21:17.413
The sea ..

01:21:18.624 --> 01:21:20.959
Go to the sea

01:21:21.710 --> 01:21:23.169
Do not exhaust.

01:21:23.337 --> 01:21:25.213
You'll find water...

01:21:25.381 --> 01:21:29.092
In the sea! It is in the sea

01:21:29.426 --> 01:21:30.593
Yes, of course...

01:21:30.761 --> 01:21:31.844
It's okay.

01:22:04.211 --> 01:22:05.753
I grew up with him.

01:22:08.215 --> 01:22:10.049
I am married to her sister.

01:22:12.553 --> 01:22:14.220
I'm sorry, Ameer.

01:22:14.555 --> 01:22:16.222
It was God's will.

01:22:16.640 --> 01:22:20.727
God hates  what is
to each other in His name.

01:22:30.779 --> 01:22:32.655
It is from here.

01:22:32.948 --> 01:22:35.408
Nesib will embark on our heels.

01:22:35.576 --> 01:22:38.244
He's right.
It will send its planes.

01:22:46.170 --> 01:22:47.670
That's the war?

01:22:50.924 --> 01:22:52.634
What inspired epics?

01:22:53.969 --> 01:22:54.969
Yes.

01:22:57.348 --> 01:23:01.768
What is really scary,
it is how you're good at it.

01:23:13.405 --> 01:23:16.824
Send the army in the Corridor.
Finally, what is left.

01:23:16.992 --> 01:23:19.452
Is this really wise?

01:23:20.079 --> 01:23:21.996
I sent my armor,

01:23:22.164 --> 01:23:24.832
my best plane with my son on board.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.086
No one has returned.
What do you want more?

01:23:28.253 --> 01:23:30.880
Prefer pick Amar yourself?

01:23:31.048 --> 01:23:31.923
Come!

01:23:32.091 --> 01:23:32.965
How do you know?

01:23:33.133 --> 01:23:36.219
My spies saw him leave Salmaah

01:23:38.806 --> 01:23:42.058
He chose his camp,
that of the murderer of your brother.

01:23:43.227 --> 01:23:44.268
You killed Saleh.

01:23:44.561 --> 01:23:46.312
I have not killed Saleh.

01:23:46.855 --> 01:23:48.439
He died, that's all.

01:23:49.983 --> 01:23:53.569
This junk of Auda has betrayed you as
he betrayed me.

01:23:53.737 --> 01:23:56.531
A Amar Amar remains one.

01:23:58.033 --> 01:24:00.159
Explain to him what the Koran says.

01:24:01.286 --> 01:24:05.581
The Qur'an says many things
on many subjects.

01:24:05.749 --> 01:24:06.791
On divorce, idiot!

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:10.128
Allah does not favor.

01:24:10.587 --> 01:24:13.464
Except when the husband is beneath all,

01:24:13.716 --> 01:24:15.341
if he fled

01:24:15.676 --> 01:24:18.428
and joined a foreign army to march against
his family.

01:24:19.012 --> 01:24:19.637
So...

01:24:19.847 --> 01:24:22.265
So... the wife...

01:24:22.808 --> 01:24:24.934
Can break marriage

01:24:25.102 --> 01:24:28.062
if
repeats three times "I divorce..."

01:24:28.397 --> 01:24:30.732
"On Auda, son of Amar!"

01:24:31.066 --> 01:24:32.275
Approach.

01:24:36.363 --> 01:24:37.488
Now

01:24:38.073 --> 01:24:40.074
say three times:

01:24:41.076 --> 01:24:42.744
"Me, Leyla,

01:24:43.036 --> 01:24:44.704
" Nesib daughter,

01:24:45.080 --> 01:24:48.207
"I divorce Auda, son of Amar."

01:24:48.417 --> 01:24:49.667
Say it.

01:24:54.173 --> 01:24:55.131
I refuse.

01:24:55.549 --> 01:24:56.549
You refuse?

01:24:58.510 --> 01:25:01.304
If Auda followed his father,

01:25:01.472 --> 01:25:03.598
is that he had no choice.

01:25:03.891 --> 01:25:07.685
This is the man most peaceful
imaginable.

01:25:07.853 --> 01:25:08.811
Pacific?

01:25:09.104 --> 01:25:09.854
Yes.

01:25:10.439 --> 01:25:12.857
It is just like his father.

01:25:13.025 --> 01:25:14.609
It is worse, actually.

01:25:14.777 --> 01:25:17.320
Amar's just stark raving mad!

01:25:18.530 --> 01:25:19.614
Okay.

01:25:22.242 --> 01:25:23.409
Disobey me.

01:25:24.036 --> 01:25:26.078
What's the divorce of a corpse?

01:25:27.873 --> 01:25:28.998
A corpse?

01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.127
"Hardened criminals",
my father said.

01:25:33.378 --> 01:25:35.630
"Dangerous men."

01:25:36.507 --> 01:25:38.007
He was right.

01:25:38.258 --> 01:25:39.967
You are dangerous.

01:25:40.761 --> 01:25:43.012
But this battle is not yours.

01:25:43.388 --> 01:25:44.639
You can leave.

01:25:46.016 --> 01:25:47.391
And the water?

01:25:47.810 --> 01:25:49.352
We share what is left.

01:25:50.270 --> 01:25:51.395
You go where?

01:25:51.772 --> 01:25:52.897
Eastward.

01:25:53.565 --> 01:25:56.484
The sea Nobody will get us there.

01:25:56.652 --> 01:25:57.985
I come with you.

01:26:00.364 --> 01:26:01.781
We also .

01:26:52.165 --> 01:26:55.334
If this is the house of God, it must be
exit.

01:26:56.128 --> 01:26:59.213
I am sure that the camel was right.

01:26:59.590 --> 01:27:02.174
Can be found in the water near the sea

01:27:04.386 --> 01:27:05.678
Who will give us?

01:27:05.971 --> 01:27:07.388
Fishermen.

01:27:08.223 --> 01:27:11.976
Merchants.
There are always people near the sea

01:27:22.404 --> 01:27:23.195
A drop.

01:27:58.148 --> 01:27:59.023
The sea!

01:27:59.900 --> 01:28:01.734
Look! The sea!

01:28:12.245 --> 01:28:14.497
Do not drink this water.

01:28:18.126 --> 01:28:19.460
Do not drink.

01:28:21.964 --> 01:28:24.215
Do not drink the sea

01:28:29.096 --> 01:28:31.305
Do not drink seawater

01:28:32.015 --> 01:28:34.934
The salt enters the bloodstream,
it would kill you.

01:28:35.352 --> 01:28:37.770
Do not drink it.

01:28:38.605 --> 01:28:40.439
Stop! The salt will kill you.

01:28:41.191 --> 01:28:43.067
Wet your mouth.

01:28:52.285 --> 01:28:53.661
Al Gloui, Talib!

01:28:54.079 --> 01:28:55.579
Reassemble the coast.

01:28:56.039 --> 01:28:57.456
See what you find.

01:29:02.838 --> 01:29:04.213
Donne.

01:29:06.049 --> 01:29:06.924
From sea water!

01:29:21.231 --> 01:29:22.148
Nothing emir.

01:29:32.743 --> 01:29:34.994
Standing, everyone!
We're going.

01:29:56.975 --> 01:29:59.852
You know, go to the sea,

01:30:00.020 --> 01:30:04.607
it was a choice between certain death and probable death
.

01:30:06.193 --> 01:30:10.071
And the probable death became certain.

01:30:10.864 --> 01:30:12.948
Well, Your Majesty,

01:30:13.408 --> 01:30:16.994
very soon, our tongues will swell,

01:30:17.704 --> 01:30:22.041
our behavior will become very strange and...

01:30:23.752 --> 01:30:25.711
And then we fall asleep.

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:35.638
I wish I could die without
this strange noise.

01:30:49.611 --> 01:30:50.903
He said...

01:30:51.738 --> 01:30:55.366
The camel said:
"Water is in the sea...".

01:30:55.534 --> 01:30:58.119
No
near the sea In the sea!

01:30:58.578 --> 01:31:00.121
This is a source.

01:31:01.164 --> 01:31:02.414
A submarine spring!

01:31:06.002 --> 01:31:07.044
She like?

01:31:09.172 --> 01:31:11.423
Salee. It is not fresh water.

01:31:11.591 --> 01:31:12.800
Do we get to the bottom!

01:31:24.062 --> 01:31:25.354
She's sweet .

01:31:26.523 --> 01:31:27.982
This is fresh water!

01:31:36.908 --> 01:31:37.950
Okay?

01:31:42.164 --> 01:31:43.414
The skins!

01:31:43.790 --> 01:31:45.541
Bring the bottles.

01:31:45.917 --> 01:31:47.918
- What?
- They found a source.

01:31:54.259 --> 01:31:55.718
Underwater!

01:31:59.389 --> 01:32:00.723
We have water!

01:32:07.981 --> 01:32:09.190
Glory to Allah!

01:32:17.365 --> 01:32:20.743
Start by getting wet mouth.
Softly!

01:32:34.299 --> 01:32:36.467
Beasts just revenge.

01:32:36.927 --> 01:32:39.220
Now it is we who wear them.

01:32:52.984 --> 01:32:54.610
These are the Beni Sirris,

01:32:54.778 --> 01:32:56.904
camel herders known.

01:32:57.656 --> 01:32:58.280
Looters,

01:32:59.407 --> 01:33:01.700
famous slave traders.

01:33:10.794 --> 01:33:13.295
He wears the green turban. This is Amar.

01:33:20.345 --> 01:33:21.679
This is Amar.

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:23.681
This is Auda.

01:33:24.224 --> 01:33:26.809
Go Nesibiens prevent. Hurry!

01:33:42.409 --> 01:33:43.325
Welcome!

01:33:44.536 --> 01:33:45.619
Thank you, Sheikh.

01:33:45.787 --> 01:33:48.580
Welcome, Prince Amar ibn Auda,

01:33:48.832 --> 01:33:51.417
son of the Bey al Kursi Salmaah.

01:33:51.584 --> 01:33:54.837
My modest
Bedouin tent is not worthy of you.

01:33:55.088 --> 01:33:59.091
I can not refuse to
son of two such illustrious fathers.

01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:02.511
Take all you want camels.

01:34:02.679 --> 01:34:04.430
On one condition.

01:34:04.639 --> 01:34:06.765
Whether you drink coffee with us.

01:34:08.268 --> 01:34:09.310
God exists!

01:34:17.402 --> 01:34:20.654
See, when you start to grind coffee
,

01:34:20.822 --> 01:34:22.573
everyone has the right to enter.

01:34:32.542 --> 01:34:33.625
Hi.

01:34:38.798 --> 01:34:40.758
You were, if I remember correctly,

01:34:41.426 --> 01:34:43.135
at our wedding.

01:34:44.679 --> 01:34:46.889
A memory of this great day!

01:34:50.185 --> 01:34:51.477
Come here.

01:34:51.853 --> 01:34:53.312
Closer.

01:34:54.397 --> 01:34:55.356
Idiot!

01:34:56.816 --> 01:34:58.442
But what a fool!

01:34:59.402 --> 01:35:01.779
The Beni Sirris know how to use the stick.

01:35:02.155 --> 01:35:05.783
It is not ours.
This is a Zamiri.

01:35:05.992 --> 01:35:07.409
A prize of war?

01:35:07.577 --> 01:35:08.577
Yes.

01:35:09.371 --> 01:35:12.456
The Zamiris are unable to keep their wives.

01:35:12.624 --> 01:35:15.584
They ride horses
as men, bare face.

01:35:15.752 --> 01:35:17.252
I would buy it.

01:35:18.004 --> 01:35:19.254
It is not for sale.

01:35:19.422 --> 01:35:20.881
Of course not.

01:35:21.800 --> 01:35:23.092
My father, your king...

01:35:23.343 --> 01:35:25.844
Said that nothing of value can not be bought.

01:35:26.346 --> 01:35:27.471
He's right.

01:35:27.847 --> 01:35:28.889
I swapped the.

01:35:30.183 --> 01:35:32.017
This is the ring of my mother, Zamira.

01:35:33.103 --> 01:35:35.145
Zamiri It was a princess.

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:36.939
She rode bare face.

01:35:37.440 --> 01:35:39.066
It is not for sale,

01:35:39.234 --> 01:35:43.445
Auda, son of Zamira
who was the slave of Amar.

01:35:46.866 --> 01:35:48.242
You make a mistake.

01:35:48.535 --> 01:35:52.746
It is you who have committed a
leaving your library

01:35:52.914 --> 01:35:54.790
Auda with soft hands.

01:35:54.958 --> 01:35:56.583
You do not make the weight.

01:35:56.751 --> 01:35:59.795
Nesib traveled from one horizon to another.

01:36:00.505 --> 01:36:03.507
He sprinkled gold all the tribes.

01:36:03.675 --> 01:36:06.635
We are all in competition

01:36:06.803 --> 01:36:08.929
To be the first to cut off your head

01:36:09.305 --> 01:36:12.433
and bring it to Ibn Idris
which, they say,

01:36:12.642 --> 01:36:14.476
promise to your wife.

01:36:18.690 --> 01:36:19.731
Come near me.

01:36:29.033 --> 01:36:30.284
You know, Sheik,

01:36:30.452 --> 01:36:33.412
what is valuable is gained by
love or blood.

01:36:33.788 --> 01:36:37.583
What will you gain by
love or blood,

01:36:37.750 --> 01:36:39.543
Auda with soft hands?

01:36:39.794 --> 01:36:41.086
You are surrounded.

01:36:50.930 --> 01:36:52.139
No, it's you.

01:37:11.075 --> 01:37:12.117
Hi!

01:37:13.953 --> 01:37:15.412
Cut my head!

01:37:16.331 --> 01:37:17.664
Take up arms.

01:37:20.627 --> 01:37:22.336
While you're at it, the watch!

01:37:23.755 --> 01:37:25.088
Thank you.

01:37:25.298 --> 01:37:26.924
Will revert to coffee.

01:37:27.091 --> 01:37:28.467
On your knees!

01:37:39.062 --> 01:37:41.688
- From what tribe are you?
- Bani Khalid.

01:37:42.357 --> 01:37:44.775
Ahmed, bring her home.

01:37:46.986 --> 01:37:48.237
I Djanahid.

01:37:48.404 --> 01:37:50.322
- Yafidi.
- Rahmidi.

01:37:50.490 --> 01:37:51.949
I am a hostage Djunfiz.

01:37:52.116 --> 01:37:53.825
I too have been held hostage.

01:37:53.993 --> 01:37:57.746
Time
slaves and hostage-taking is over.

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:04.628
I know how it feels.

01:38:07.423 --> 01:38:09.132
He's right, this old dog.

01:38:09.759 --> 01:38:13.178
Only Zamiris refused gold Nesib.

01:38:14.472 --> 01:38:17.975
All I know gold,
is that its course is unstable.

01:38:20.144 --> 01:38:23.272
Follow me at mine.
You will need help.

01:38:27.277 --> 01:38:28.735
They took everything.

01:38:28.903 --> 01:38:31.280
I swear to God Almighty

01:38:39.664 --> 01:38:41.331
Tell me about my mother.

01:38:42.375 --> 01:38:43.959
It was like you?

01:38:45.003 --> 01:38:48.297
She was of noble birth.
She could read and write.

01:38:49.007 --> 01:38:50.799
Auda can teach you.

01:38:52.260 --> 01:38:54.094
This is a great modernizer.

01:38:54.262 --> 01:38:56.513
I will be his Minister of Health.

01:38:56.723 --> 01:38:58.473
And of Education.

01:38:58.641 --> 01:38:59.641
Among other.

01:39:02.645 --> 01:39:05.314
Your father had promised to be always with us

01:39:05.481 --> 01:39:07.149
Zamira when he married,

01:39:07.817 --> 01:39:09.443
but we never saw him again.

01:39:10.069 --> 01:39:11.069
Our Beloved Dad!

01:39:12.322 --> 01:39:14.281
They ride like men...

01:39:21.706 --> 01:39:22.998
Stand back!

01:39:26.669 --> 01:39:28.462
You killed the emir!

01:39:29.047 --> 01:39:31.006
Why?
We are friends.

01:39:31.716 --> 01:39:33.050
We freed yours.

01:39:34.010 --> 01:39:34.843
Are you crazy?

01:39:35.428 --> 01:39:38.013
It is not breathing.
Aside!

01:39:39.682 --> 01:39:42.059
Fools, you killed him!

01:39:42.727 --> 01:39:44.728
I shot Amar, perjurer.

01:39:46.731 --> 01:39:49.066
You have killed the son of Amar Auda...

01:39:50.276 --> 01:39:51.777
And Zamira!

01:39:53.071 --> 01:39:54.112
Zamira's son?

01:39:55.281 --> 01:39:57.074
Why is he dressed like Amar?

01:40:03.122 --> 01:40:04.373
Not my brother!

01:40:07.794 --> 01:40:12.005
Our Emir is dead!

01:40:12.215 --> 01:40:13.715
Prince Auda died.

01:40:18.346 --> 01:40:19.388
Captain!

01:40:23.393 --> 01:40:26.478
Prince Auda is the Beni Sirris thereby.

01:40:51.337 --> 01:40:52.337
Auda!

01:40:54.090 --> 01:40:55.716
Do you hear me?

01:40:56.300 --> 01:40:59.094
Auda? You hear me?

01:41:00.471 --> 01:41:02.180
Okay. I was...

01:41:05.143 --> 01:41:06.476
A case of jaw putativa.

01:41:06.769 --> 01:41:09.396
It gives  all the symptoms of death.

01:41:10.565 --> 01:41:13.608
In the West, they wait 36 ​​hours
for burial.

01:41:13.776 --> 01:41:15.402
Lucky, your grave waiting for you.

01:41:15.570 --> 01:41:16.945
Water for my brother!

01:41:17.655 --> 01:41:19.948
It is said that a prince zamiri

01:41:20.116 --> 01:41:23.535
return from the dead
under the banner of the Prophet.

01:41:23.703 --> 01:41:29.583
Auda is the Mahdi!

01:41:30.585 --> 01:41:32.002
Stand back.

01:41:35.131 --> 01:41:37.007
You are thirsty? Drink some.

01:41:39.260 --> 01:41:40.469
Let him pass.

01:41:40.636 --> 01:41:41.970
What do they say?

01:41:47.018 --> 01:41:48.810
Ali, I am not the Mahdi.

01:41:48.978 --> 01:41:50.228
Explain to them.

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:52.230
This is our secret.

01:41:52.398 --> 01:41:54.024
I am not the Mahdi.

01:41:54.192 --> 01:41:55.484
I am not the Mahdi!

01:42:01.073 --> 01:42:03.033
Put ​​you under cover!

01:42:06.370 --> 01:42:08.622
Shoot it! Pull the plane.

01:43:00.591 --> 01:43:03.343
No one is injured,
it is a miracle!

01:43:03.511 --> 01:43:05.136
No one is injured.

01:43:25.449 --> 01:43:27.033
It's not that bad!

01:43:27.869 --> 01:43:30.871
Let me make the diagnosis.
Thank you.

01:43:31.414 --> 01:43:33.707
The bullet went through my body.

01:43:33.875 --> 01:43:37.752
She blew the left scapula.

01:43:37.920 --> 01:43:39.212
But I think...

01:43:39.714 --> 01:43:41.923
The problem,
is the rupture of the aorta.

01:43:42.091 --> 01:43:45.218
I'm trying to drown myself in my own blood
.

01:43:45.386 --> 01:43:46.553
Do not talk.

01:43:46.888 --> 01:43:48.638
That's harder.

01:43:53.686 --> 01:43:55.061
Ali, I beg you...

01:43:56.439 --> 01:43:58.023
Submit yourself to God.

01:43:59.358 --> 01:44:02.360
Kiss the foot that crushes me?

01:44:05.406 --> 01:44:07.616
I'm cold.
Hold me in your arms.

01:44:08.326 --> 01:44:09.618
I'm afraid of the dark.

01:44:11.454 --> 01:44:12.704
All these...

01:44:23.174 --> 01:44:25.091
When you get beyond the grave

01:44:26.636 --> 01:44:29.387
and the angel will ask thy God which is
,

01:44:29.847 --> 01:44:31.348
what will you say?

01:44:38.648 --> 01:44:39.814
Allah.

01:44:42.610 --> 01:44:44.402
And when you ask

01:44:45.655 --> 01:44:47.447
which is His Messenger?

01:44:50.493 --> 01:44:51.952
Please, Ali!

01:44:57.208 --> 01:44:58.375
Mohamed.

01:45:03.798 --> 01:45:06.257
And when the angel asks you

01:45:06.550 --> 01:45:08.301
"What is your religion?"

01:45:10.763 --> 01:45:12.305
What do you say?

01:45:13.724 --> 01:45:14.933
Islam.

01:45:24.110 --> 01:45:25.652
My brother...

01:45:31.534 --> 01:45:35.453
Promise me you renverseras the chessboard.

01:46:53.365 --> 01:46:54.491
Look!

01:47:00.915 --> 01:47:02.874
We bring horses.

01:47:03.042 --> 01:47:05.043
A gift to the Emir of Anizas.

01:47:06.587 --> 01:47:07.378
Welcome!

01:47:11.759 --> 01:47:14.928
You give additional food to the beasts.

01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:20.016
So we will fight?

01:47:30.903 --> 01:47:33.113
The Anizas are there, Emir.

01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:34.989
They want to come with us.

01:47:36.075 --> 01:47:38.576
They have horses and guns.

01:47:38.994 --> 01:47:40.662
- Where are they?
- Over there.

01:47:53.551 --> 01:47:55.677
Amar Men are everywhere.

01:47:56.053 --> 01:47:57.387
We're trapped.

01:47:57.638 --> 01:47:59.639
They surround us.

01:48:00.724 --> 01:48:01.683
We're trapped!

01:48:14.196 --> 01:48:17.157
- We're surrounded.
- I know, I saw them.

01:48:17.324 --> 01:48:19.117
Do we have a solution?

01:48:20.286 --> 01:48:21.411
Yes.

01:48:43.934 --> 01:48:45.226
Take what you want.

01:48:45.936 --> 01:48:46.978
But...

01:48:47.980 --> 01:48:49.105
Savings Hobeika.

01:48:52.026 --> 01:48:53.401
My son died.

01:48:53.777 --> 01:48:54.986
Tarik too.

01:48:57.781 --> 01:48:59.407
I'm sorry.

01:49:01.994 --> 01:49:05.955
I ask you only to honor the agreement of 15 years ago.

01:49:08.417 --> 01:49:09.083
That's it?

01:49:10.628 --> 01:49:11.502
That's all.

01:49:16.467 --> 01:49:19.844
I was told that you were not
in the House of God

01:49:23.015 --> 01:49:24.015
And then...

01:49:24.516 --> 01:49:27.268
Pass through the Northern Route because you knew

01:49:27.436 --> 01:49:30.230
I was going to build the Corridor...

01:49:31.523 --> 01:49:33.191
It was a masterstroke.

01:49:34.944 --> 01:49:36.486
I was not in the desert.

01:49:38.447 --> 01:49:40.823
There has someone out there.

01:49:43.285 --> 01:49:44.535
But who?

01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:47.872
Men approaching.

01:49:57.758 --> 01:50:00.802
- Who are you?
- The Bani Sadr, Amir.

01:50:01.011 --> 01:50:03.554
You've made my beloved daughter.

01:50:03.722 --> 01:50:05.890
Our rifles are your guns.

01:50:06.350 --> 01:50:07.475
You know where you go?

01:50:07.851 --> 01:50:09.852
It would follow you to hell.

01:50:33.627 --> 01:50:34.961
You! Get off there.

01:50:35.129 --> 01:50:36.629
Let your arms.

01:50:51.603 --> 01:50:53.104
Close me everything.

01:50:55.983 --> 01:50:57.025
Immediately.

01:51:16.712 --> 01:51:17.837
Stop it!

01:51:26.930 --> 01:51:28.097
Go away!

01:51:30.225 --> 01:51:31.726
You, down there.

01:51:32.978 --> 01:51:33.936
Get off!

01:51:38.525 --> 01:51:39.442
Auda?

01:51:47.659 --> 01:51:48.826
Praise God!

01:51:49.870 --> 01:51:51.621
I thought you were dead.

01:51:58.629 --> 01:52:00.505
No son would have done better than you.

01:52:01.673 --> 01:52:03.800
The rumor was that you had joined

01:52:03.967 --> 01:52:05.593
certain southern tribes.

01:52:06.762 --> 01:52:08.846
No some of them.

01:52:09.598 --> 01:52:11.599
But all.

01:52:23.904 --> 01:52:25.530
Madhi!

01:52:34.957 --> 01:52:36.040
Little brat!

01:52:37.292 --> 01:52:38.459
The Mahdi?

01:52:41.380 --> 01:52:45.049
The Mahdi?
This is a librarian, dammit!

01:52:59.982 --> 01:53:00.898
What do you want?

01:53:01.650 --> 01:53:02.817
The Yellow Corridor.

01:53:03.193 --> 01:53:04.360
Can.

01:53:05.863 --> 01:53:07.572
I gave my word.

01:53:09.074 --> 01:53:12.160
You should not have.
The Corridor is not yours.

01:53:12.619 --> 01:53:14.579
Who owns it? To you?

01:53:15.539 --> 01:53:16.747
Together.

01:53:19.501 --> 01:53:23.171
It is with them that you will...
What is LinkedIn?

01:53:23.714 --> 01:53:24.964
Building a new country?

01:53:26.925 --> 01:53:29.260
They are there  today, but tomorrow?

01:53:30.512 --> 01:53:32.430
They are willing to die for me.

01:53:32.598 --> 01:53:35.725
And when death is over, what will you do
?

01:53:37.978 --> 01:53:39.687
You shall bend the Americans?

01:53:39.855 --> 01:53:41.063
Yes!

01:53:41.231 --> 01:53:42.607
I will build hospitals, schools.

01:53:42.774 --> 01:53:44.901
Nesib built schools.

01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:46.777
And hospitals.

01:53:46.945 --> 01:53:50.740
Trifles offered by foreign
as courtesans.

01:53:50.908 --> 01:53:52.575
They never go away.

01:53:52.743 --> 01:53:54.202
The others will come.

01:53:54.369 --> 01:53:56.954
They build thousand sites like this.

01:53:58.081 --> 01:53:59.248
Because...

01:53:59.875 --> 01:54:03.419
They suffer from terrible thirst

01:54:03.629 --> 01:54:05.546
nothing to quench.

01:54:06.882 --> 01:54:08.799
And even if they go one day,

01:54:09.468 --> 01:54:10.676
finally,

01:54:12.846 --> 01:54:15.348
we do we will recognize more.

01:54:17.100 --> 01:54:18.226
Now

01:54:18.602 --> 01:54:20.436
give me the command.

01:54:25.067 --> 01:54:28.528
I've always wondered one thing,
you and Saleh.

01:54:29.154 --> 01:54:30.279
From reading the Koran.

01:54:30.531 --> 01:54:33.950
Then you know that there is a case where a
son can disobey

01:54:37.079 --> 01:54:38.204
Which?

01:54:38.956 --> 01:54:40.998
If you asked me to deny God.

01:54:43.835 --> 01:54:45.086
Is this the case?

01:54:58.517 --> 01:55:00.810
Auda, I have sworn to kill you.

01:55:05.524 --> 01:55:06.482
Vengeance!

01:55:08.527 --> 01:55:10.027
Who did this?

01:55:10.195 --> 01:55:12.196
This old fool Beni Sirri!

01:55:21.915 --> 01:55:23.457
You're a good boy.

01:55:27.129 --> 01:55:28.212
A boy well.

01:55:39.349 --> 01:55:40.766
They will attack.

01:55:41.810 --> 01:55:43.644
Take your positions!

01:55:43.895 --> 01:55:44.854
Fire!

01:56:13.925 --> 01:56:15.176
This way!

01:56:34.029 --> 01:56:35.821
Back to the derricks!

01:56:37.282 --> 01:56:38.532
Towards the derricks!

01:58:10.500 --> 01:58:11.208
Auda!

01:58:12.335 --> 01:58:13.836
Zamiri Son of a bitch!

01:58:22.220 --> 01:58:24.138
Where did you learn to wield the sword?

01:58:24.306 --> 01:58:25.222
At the library?

01:59:14.397 --> 01:59:16.899
Take your mind to see your princess.

01:59:17.067 --> 01:59:18.275
You're right.

01:59:25.575 --> 01:59:27.993
See you maybe.
In the desert.

01:59:28.995 --> 01:59:30.704
Where Zamiris live.

01:59:30.872 --> 01:59:33.499
Where men and women complement each other.

01:59:34.334 --> 01:59:35.709
Since water and thirst.

01:59:37.712 --> 01:59:39.046
Together

01:59:41.007 --> 01:59:42.424
if any.

01:59:45.178 --> 01:59:46.887
Alone we are nothing.

01:59:55.146 --> 01:59:56.272
Magrouf!

01:59:57.148 --> 01:59:58.399
Catch up with it.

02:00:01.570 --> 02:00:02.695
Are you sure, Emir?

02:00:34.561 --> 02:00:35.603
U-turn!

02:00:35.979 --> 02:00:38.689
Do you return all!

02:00:38.857 --> 02:00:41.692
Turn! Back to women!

02:00:41.860 --> 02:00:44.028
All eyes to the mountains.

02:01:15.852 --> 02:01:17.728
My boy out of a book!

02:01:18.063 --> 02:01:19.688
With a beard...

02:01:19.856 --> 02:01:21.106
Not for long.

02:01:22.692 --> 02:01:23.776
Keep it.

02:01:24.611 --> 02:01:26.737
You are beautiful like that.

02:01:31.826 --> 02:01:34.411
No words can translate

02:01:34.871 --> 02:01:36.664
sadness I feel

02:01:36.831 --> 02:01:39.708
the death of your... our father.

02:01:46.508 --> 02:01:49.510
I've got news for you.

02:01:50.971 --> 02:01:54.056
We lost a life...

02:01:57.477 --> 02:02:00.187
But I think we'll win another
.

02:02:06.236 --> 02:02:07.861
Father awaits you.

02:02:08.321 --> 02:02:10.114
Qu'Hobeika He fears...

02:02:10.490 --> 02:02:12.032
I smite myself

02:02:12.200 --> 02:02:14.827
anyone to take in the city or its inhabitants
.

02:02:18.707 --> 02:02:19.748
Et ..

02:02:20.959 --> 02:02:22.292
My father?

02:02:43.106 --> 02:02:46.900
Look who we found in the dungeons of
Hobeika.

02:02:48.570 --> 02:02:51.905
I have never betrayed your father, Sidi.
Never.

02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:55.576
I know, Hassan.

02:03:03.501 --> 02:03:04.710
Untie it.

02:03:17.807 --> 02:03:19.308
Death to Nesib!

02:03:19.934 --> 02:03:21.101
Nesib Kill!

02:03:21.269 --> 02:03:22.895
Nesib, the traitor!

02:03:23.438 --> 02:03:25.147
Kill him or he will kill us.

02:03:53.718 --> 02:03:55.969
I should come here more often.

02:04:00.058 --> 02:04:01.642
You have finely played.

02:04:02.435 --> 02:04:04.603
We will have all underestimated.

02:04:05.563 --> 02:04:07.314
Until the last moment.

02:04:09.067 --> 02:04:10.901
I was raised by my men.

02:04:13.321 --> 02:04:14.947
Who makes the modest...

02:04:15.115 --> 02:04:17.616
Comes for rent twice.

02:04:21.746 --> 02:04:23.664
I was going to offer you

02:04:26.292 --> 02:04:29.419
And then I saw the inscription:

02:04:30.672 --> 02:04:32.172
"On behalf of your friends

02:04:32.674 --> 02:04:34.383
" the Texan Oil. "

02:04:36.219 --> 02:04:39.054
Yes, it can remove
be a bit of panache.

02:04:39.973 --> 02:04:41.056
Sit.

02:04:41.224 --> 02:04:42.391
Thank you.

02:04:43.935 --> 02:04:46.270
I abdicated in favor of Leyla.

02:04:46.688 --> 02:04:51.233
As the heir of your father, you will assemble
the two kingdoms.

02:04:52.443 --> 02:04:54.778
What do you do for the Corridor
Yellow?

02:04:55.238 --> 02:04:57.823
Honoring the will of your father?

02:04:58.700 --> 02:05:02.286
What my father rest in peace and he walks with
and Ali Saleh.

02:05:03.079 --> 02:05:04.913
I ' have nothing against foreigners.

02:05:05.373 --> 02:05:09.251
They have something to bring us
and vice versa.

02:05:15.341 --> 02:05:16.550
What about me?

02:05:17.218 --> 02:05:19.887
What will you do to me?

02:05:22.807 --> 02:05:24.057
What would you do?

02:05:30.356 --> 02:05:31.857
I kill.

02:05:34.611 --> 02:05:35.569
And fast.

02:05:38.281 --> 02:05:39.656
I have a better idea.

02:05:40.074 --> 02:05:41.366
No jail!

02:05:43.036 --> 02:05:44.745
I could not bear it.

02:05:44.996 --> 02:05:48.415
If I learned one thing in the desert,
it's horrible mess.

02:05:50.168 --> 02:05:52.211
I'll send in Houston

02:05:52.754 --> 02:05:56.131
to represent us on the board of Texas Oil.

02:05:56.299 --> 02:05:59.801
I do not see anyone more devious
to defend our interests.

02:06:01.429 --> 02:06:02.638
They deserve you.

02:06:06.142 --> 02:06:07.809
Now let me.

02:06:43.012 --> 02:06:44.680
It's a smart guy.

02:06:45.765 --> 02:06:47.516
Millions of dollars!

02:06:47.684 --> 02:06:49.142
- Dollars or pounds?
- Dollars!

02:06:49.310 --> 02:06:51.645
This is a good deal for us.

02:06:52.939 --> 02:06:54.898
Thank you very much, Amir.

02:07:24.721 --> 02:07:26.763
Let them come back tomorrow.

02:07:32.145 --> 02:07:34.271
It gives these kicks!

02:07:35.690 --> 02:07:39.276
I think he's anxious to get out
to help his father.

02:07:44.282 --> 02:07:46.241
Do not be so hurry.

02:07:47.493 --> 02:07:48.869
Stay where you are.
