WEBVTT

00:02.503 --> 00:05.406
(Ben and Chip screaming)

00:06.840 --> 00:08.709
What is happening?
Is everything okay?

00:08.742 --> 00:10.178
No, it's not okay!

00:10.211 --> 00:12.646
A frickin' tarantula
almost bit my frickin' arm off!

00:12.680 --> 00:14.582
Aunt Mickey,
do something! I'm scared!

00:14.615 --> 00:15.583
Where?!

00:15.616 --> 00:17.185
Right there!
Right frickin' there!

00:17.218 --> 00:18.352
Are you blind?!

00:18.386 --> 00:20.754
Are you talking
about that?

00:20.788 --> 00:22.022
The itsy bitsy spider?

00:22.756 --> 00:23.557
(whispering): Yeah.

00:23.591 --> 00:24.925
Wow, ladies.

00:24.958 --> 00:26.660
All right, fine, I'll squish it.

00:26.694 --> 00:27.861
No! Don't hurt it!

00:27.895 --> 00:29.897
Oh, my God.

00:32.200 --> 00:35.503
(Ben and Chip screaming)

00:35.536 --> 00:37.505
Are you serious?

00:37.538 --> 00:39.173
You're frickin' suicidal, man.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.942
Guys, that was tough for me
to watch as a parent.

00:41.975 --> 00:43.211
You're not a parent.

00:43.244 --> 00:44.945
Good. 'Cause if I was,
I'd be incredibly ashamed.

00:44.978 --> 00:46.280
You are so soft.

00:46.314 --> 00:47.881
(groans)
Coffee.

00:47.915 --> 00:49.583
Get your own coffee.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.860
Mug.
There are no mugs.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.429
They piled up in the sink.
I found it irritating.

01:01.462 --> 01:02.463
Tossed 'em.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.249
(gulps) Morning.

01:21.282 --> 01:22.150
Morning.

01:22.183 --> 01:23.151
Hi.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.785
Hi. What are you
doing today, Jimmy?

01:24.818 --> 01:27.721
Oh, boy. I was gonna
go down to the airport

01:27.755 --> 01:29.957
and watch the planes land.

01:29.990 --> 01:32.793
Mm. Sounds pressing.
Uh, instead of that though,

01:32.826 --> 01:34.762
why don't you take these
two out for a guys' day?

01:34.795 --> 01:36.664
What? Why?

01:36.697 --> 01:38.399
'Cause, clearly, I'm
failing you as a father.

01:38.432 --> 01:40.334
You two need to learn
to act like men.

01:40.368 --> 01:42.603
This is your idea of a man?
The guy's an animal.

01:42.636 --> 01:44.472
Well, he's the closest
thing we've got.

01:44.505 --> 01:45.773
Maybe you'll all neutralize
each other

01:45.806 --> 01:47.575
and come back
decent human beings.

01:47.608 --> 01:50.010
Eh, no problem.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.912
I'll make men out of 'em.
Well, you don't need

01:51.945 --> 01:53.914
to make men out of 'em.
Just take 'em to a ball game

01:53.947 --> 01:54.948
or something--
you know, guy stuff.

01:54.982 --> 01:57.351
Okay.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.387
I'll do it.

02:02.190 --> 02:03.924
I'm bored.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.426
Let's do something.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.828
Well, I've never tried
mushrooms.

02:07.861 --> 02:11.265
Seems kind of extreme
for-for mid-morning.

02:11.299 --> 02:12.666
Well, what else?

02:12.700 --> 02:14.268
I don't know. Let's do, like,
a girls' day or something.

02:14.302 --> 02:16.170
You know, the guys are
out doing their thing.

02:16.204 --> 02:17.371
I am listening.

02:17.405 --> 02:19.139
Why don't we just be
predictable for once?

02:19.173 --> 02:21.141
Let's head into the city,
grab some brunch,

02:21.175 --> 02:23.311
like ladies do,
get some mani-pedis.

02:23.344 --> 02:25.513
Oh! We should go
to the Armenian part of town

02:25.546 --> 02:27.047
and hit up the hookah bars.

02:27.080 --> 02:29.049
Oh. Uh...

02:29.082 --> 02:31.285
seems a little off theme,
but, sure,

02:31.319 --> 02:32.820
yeah, why not?
Yeah. Okay.

02:32.853 --> 02:34.655
Oh, hey, girl! What do you
got going on today?

02:34.688 --> 02:36.290
Don't answer that.
Listen to this.

02:36.324 --> 02:39.527
City, brunch, manis,
pedis, hookah. In or out?

02:39.560 --> 02:41.462
Out.
What? Was it the hookah?

02:41.495 --> 02:43.464
It was everything. But I have
a doctor's appointment.

02:43.497 --> 02:44.465
You're not feeling well?

02:44.498 --> 02:45.733
It's more
of a consultation.

02:45.766 --> 02:46.967
I'm getting breast implants.

02:47.000 --> 02:48.736
What?! Why?!

02:48.769 --> 02:52.005
I mean, I know
why. But why?

02:52.039 --> 02:52.873
Because I want to.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.141
I thought you were a feminist.

02:54.174 --> 02:56.577
You can be a feminist
and also be sexy.

02:56.610 --> 02:58.412
Oh, my God. Okay.

02:58.446 --> 03:01.048
I can appreciate that you're
young and stupid. I really can.

03:01.081 --> 03:02.516
But let me take you
to school for a second.

03:02.550 --> 03:04.485
Sexy is finding the thing
that you hate most

03:04.518 --> 03:05.986
about yourself
and then shoving it

03:06.019 --> 03:07.421
into somebody else's
face until they think

03:07.455 --> 03:08.856
that you're okay with it.
Yeah.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.758
Like Adrien Brody's nose.
Yeah.

03:10.791 --> 03:12.493
I don't want Adrien Brody's nose
for boobs.

03:12.526 --> 03:14.562
Yeah, okay. Well, I don't want
my knees, but that's life.

03:14.595 --> 03:16.830
What's wrong with your knees?
My knees are disgusting.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.098
That's a weird insecurity.

03:18.131 --> 03:19.233
Stop talking about my knees!

03:19.267 --> 03:20.868
Okay? It's not about
my knees, okay?

03:20.901 --> 03:22.370
You're not getting a boob job.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.572
Your mom's not here,
and I'm not signing off on it.

03:24.605 --> 03:26.240
My mom bought them for me.

03:26.274 --> 03:28.075
They're my
18th birthday present.

03:28.108 --> 03:29.443
Well, you're 17.

03:29.477 --> 03:30.878
I'm gonna
hit the ground running.

03:30.911 --> 03:32.346
Fine. Then I'm coming
with you. There's gonna be

03:32.380 --> 03:33.847
at least one voice
of reason in that room.

03:33.881 --> 03:35.849
Wait, what about brunch?
I'm sorry, Alba,

03:35.883 --> 03:38.252
brunch is canceled on account
of Sabrina's stupidity.

03:38.286 --> 03:40.754
Aw, come...
(clicks tongue)

03:41.789 --> 03:43.056
(crowd cheering)

03:43.090 --> 03:44.792
Whoa, is he okay?

03:44.825 --> 03:47.094
Yeah, he's on top of
the world. Can't you tell?

03:47.127 --> 03:48.696
I don't get
this whole fandom thing.

03:48.729 --> 03:50.264
A bunch
of middle-aged slobs

03:50.298 --> 03:52.032
dressed up like some
kid half their age,

03:52.065 --> 03:54.134
like they're a part of
something. It's pathetic.

03:54.167 --> 03:56.136
Yeah, boys.

03:56.169 --> 03:58.772
I'm gonna get sick today.
I know it.

04:00.007 --> 04:02.042
All right, I was
able to scalp

04:02.075 --> 04:03.877
two tickets together
near the end zone.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.813
Ben and I will be there
with the diehards.

04:05.846 --> 04:10.050
And you are in
section 339, row double-Q.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.084
Might want to wear
some sunblock.

04:11.118 --> 04:12.920
You're gonna get scorched.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.622
Why am I sitting alone?

04:14.655 --> 04:17.090
'Cause I bought the tickets.
I gave you the money.

04:17.124 --> 04:19.493
Okay, let's not get bogged down
in the details right now.

04:19.527 --> 04:20.494
I don't even want to be here.

04:20.528 --> 04:21.895
I like my sports
in high definition.

04:21.929 --> 04:24.832
Buck up, Mary. Part of being
a man's going it alone.

04:24.865 --> 04:27.501
Let's meet at this light post
20 minutes after the game.

04:27.535 --> 04:29.803
There's a million light posts.

04:29.837 --> 04:31.705
Oh, really, are there
a million light posts?

04:32.806 --> 04:34.775
All right, fine.

04:34.808 --> 04:37.311
Then the light post next
to the red car, smart guy.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.580
Let's get in there. I like
to berate the opposing team

04:39.613 --> 04:40.581
during warm-ups.

04:40.614 --> 04:42.516
Turtle town, baby!

04:42.550 --> 04:44.952
Screw this.

04:44.985 --> 04:47.054
Where can I get a ticket?

04:49.390 --> 04:51.158
Thanks.

04:51.191 --> 04:53.994
"Dr. J. Goodby."

04:54.027 --> 04:56.296
Stupid name.
What?

04:56.330 --> 04:59.600
Sabrina, nice
to see you again.

04:59.633 --> 05:02.135
Hi, I'm Dr. Goodby.
Mm-hmm.

05:02.169 --> 05:04.872
Yeah. Yeah, you would be.

05:04.905 --> 05:06.640
Please.

05:06.674 --> 05:11.044
Well, clearly very good
at what you do.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.813
Ignore her.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.548
So what brings you in today?

05:14.582 --> 05:16.350
Cut the crap, Goodby.
We all know why we're here.

05:16.384 --> 05:17.485
GOODBY:
Right.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.786
Breast implants.

05:18.819 --> 05:20.988
I see your mom already paid
for everything.

05:21.021 --> 05:23.824
Yeah, she's gunning
for mother of the year.

05:23.857 --> 05:26.527
Well, all you have to do
is choose a size.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.629
What would you recommend?
I don't want to go freakish

05:28.662 --> 05:30.464
with it, I just want
to look more mature.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.633
You already look 25.
Then again, the
last thing I want

05:32.666 --> 05:34.802
is to feel like I
didn't go big enough.
Oh, God.

05:34.835 --> 05:36.537
How do you think a "D"
would look?

05:36.570 --> 05:40.408
Like a broom.
With cantaloupes taped onto it.

05:40.441 --> 05:41.842
Well, we do have
some model implants,

05:41.875 --> 05:43.210
if you'd like to see
for yourself.

05:43.243 --> 05:44.077
Thank you.

05:45.278 --> 05:48.181
There are a couple
of options:

05:48.215 --> 05:50.818
saline, a sterile
saltwater solution;

05:50.851 --> 05:53.654
or silicone,
a sturdier gel substance.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.656
Saline, definitely.
It's more natural.

05:55.689 --> 05:58.559
Mm. Yeah, always going
green, this one.

05:58.592 --> 06:00.861
Go ahead.
You're welcome to touch.

06:02.430 --> 06:04.031
Want to feel?

06:04.064 --> 06:07.200
Well, yeah, I mean,
obviously, I want to feel.

06:07.234 --> 06:08.235
(chuckles)

06:10.237 --> 06:12.272
Yeah. Okay.

06:12.305 --> 06:14.608
Got a real
weight to 'em.
Mm.

06:14.642 --> 06:16.610
Squishy. Nice.

06:16.644 --> 06:18.746
Um...

06:18.779 --> 06:20.781
what do you think about us
taking 'em for a spin?

06:20.814 --> 06:24.017
It's not a used car lot.
Oh, it's no problem.
Let me get a gown.

06:24.051 --> 06:25.218
Oh, no, sorry, I was
thinking more along

06:25.252 --> 06:26.353
the lines of a field test.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.888
Think it'd be pretty good
for this one

06:27.921 --> 06:29.089
to see what people think
about her new friends.

06:29.122 --> 06:30.558
I don't care what people think.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.460
Yeah, but you care enough to get
'em in the first place, so...

06:32.493 --> 06:33.894
It's fine, right?

06:33.927 --> 06:35.395
What do you say? We'll just
take 'em around the block,

06:35.429 --> 06:36.797
have 'em back by supper.

06:38.499 --> 06:40.367
(sighs)

06:40.400 --> 06:42.536
Okay. Just be careful.

06:42.570 --> 06:44.271
You got it.
What do you say,

06:44.304 --> 06:46.339
want to walk a mile
in these boobs?

06:49.910 --> 06:52.913
Good morning. Excuse me.
Hi. Hi there.
Oh, hi.

06:52.946 --> 06:55.916
Excuse me. Hi.
Beautiful day, isn't it?

06:55.949 --> 06:57.417
Excuse me.

06:57.451 --> 06:59.252
What's up? Hey.

06:59.286 --> 07:00.287
How you doing?

07:00.320 --> 07:02.490
Wow.
I mean, my goodness.

07:02.523 --> 07:04.324
Do you feel this energy shift?

07:04.357 --> 07:05.959
I feel like
everyone's staring right at me.

07:05.993 --> 07:07.561
Yeah, maybe it's
because you're working the room

07:07.595 --> 07:08.996
like you're the mayor
of Tit Town.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.498
Yeah. You want to pop 'em on?

07:10.531 --> 07:12.165
This is gonna be you
from now on.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.834
No, it won't.
Mine'll be attached to my body,

07:13.867 --> 07:16.169
not Frankensteined into my bra.

07:16.203 --> 07:17.605
I'll get us a table.

07:17.638 --> 07:19.339
Cool. I'm just
gonna hang back here

07:19.372 --> 07:21.374
and have humongous boobs.

07:24.344 --> 07:26.279
What's shakin', pal?

07:29.216 --> 07:30.183
He said it's gonna be,
like, an hour wait.

07:30.217 --> 07:31.251
Let's get out of here.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.486
Hmm. No, it's okay,

07:32.520 --> 07:33.687
we got plenty of time.

07:33.721 --> 07:35.088
Uh, one thing I'm noticing--

07:35.122 --> 07:36.490
all the women hate me.
You picking up on that?

07:36.524 --> 07:38.425
Yeah. I am.
It's because you're

07:38.458 --> 07:39.793
eye-banging
their husbands.

07:39.827 --> 07:42.129
No, I'm not.
That's what's bugging me.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.597
I'm trying to eye-bang
their husbands,

07:43.631 --> 07:45.465
but I can't seem to make
eye contact with any of them.

07:45.499 --> 07:48.335
Too busy staring at my
tig ol' bitties, you know?

07:48.368 --> 07:51.171
Back's kind of starting to cramp
up, too. I got to be honest,

07:51.204 --> 07:53.040
I'm not seeing a whole lot
of upside to this arrangement.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.708
Just give me the boobs.

07:54.742 --> 07:57.344
Yeah?
Yeah.

07:57.377 --> 07:59.880
That's the spirit.

08:09.690 --> 08:10.991
There we go.
You're good.

08:12.593 --> 08:14.061
Hi. I'm so sorry,

08:14.094 --> 08:16.063
I know you said
it's a really long wait,

08:16.096 --> 08:18.365
but are you sure
there isn't a table?

08:18.398 --> 08:19.733
I'm sorry, you'll...

08:19.767 --> 08:21.434
(clears throat)
You know what?

08:22.369 --> 08:23.403
Follow me.

08:23.436 --> 08:24.972
Great.

08:25.005 --> 08:27.240
How's that for an upside, huh?

08:27.274 --> 08:29.176
(cackles)

08:29.209 --> 08:31.244
Sor-Sorry about that.

08:31.278 --> 08:33.647
Yeah. Yup.

08:33.681 --> 08:35.482
Once they're in the cocoon,

08:35.515 --> 08:37.918
it's like a primordial soup,
you know?

08:37.951 --> 08:39.219
Because their mouth
becomes the butt,

08:39.252 --> 08:40.487
the butt becomes the mouth,

08:40.520 --> 08:43.090
it's a mess.
It's very un...

08:45.759 --> 08:47.761
You've got to be kidding me.

08:47.795 --> 08:49.597
What? What's wrong?

08:49.630 --> 08:52.165
Some guys got no respect,
you know?

08:52.199 --> 08:55.235
They come in here dressed
like that, it really bugs me.

08:55.268 --> 08:56.937
But you don't even know them.

08:56.970 --> 08:58.438
I don't have to know 'em, Ben.

08:58.471 --> 08:59.673
I hate 'em on principle.

08:59.707 --> 09:01.008
Why?

09:01.041 --> 09:03.243
Because they're
different than us.

09:03.276 --> 09:04.444
What if they're nice?

09:04.477 --> 09:05.913
Well, if they were nice,

09:05.946 --> 09:07.347
they wouldn't have
come into your house

09:07.380 --> 09:08.749
and crapped in your cereal.

09:08.782 --> 09:10.183
You know,
this is a good opportunity

09:10.217 --> 09:11.451
to teach you a lesson.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.120
You hungry? You like nachos?

09:13.153 --> 09:14.922
Yeah.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.289
Yeah, good. Me, too.

09:16.323 --> 09:18.191
Here's what I want you to do.

09:18.225 --> 09:20.628
I want you to pour your soda
on this clown's head.

09:20.661 --> 09:22.930
But he didn't do anything.

09:22.963 --> 09:26.033
Oh, Ben. Don't be so naive.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.668
Go ahead, it's fine.

09:30.070 --> 09:32.205
Hey, buddy,
look at me, look at me.

09:32.239 --> 09:34.374
I'm not gonna let
anything bad happen to you.

09:34.407 --> 09:36.309
Okay? I promise.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.410
Now make it rain.

09:41.749 --> 09:42.883
Hey!

09:42.916 --> 09:44.818
What's your
problem, kid?

09:44.852 --> 09:46.987
What's your problem, pal?
You want to pick on somebody

09:47.020 --> 09:48.488
your own size?
FAN: Oh!

09:48.521 --> 09:49.890
(hooting, jeering)

09:49.923 --> 09:51.491
Hey. What's going on here?

09:51.524 --> 09:52.559
Aw, these guys are upset 'cause

09:52.592 --> 09:53.727
their team's getting spanked

09:53.761 --> 09:55.395
and now he's a little sticky.

09:55.428 --> 09:56.964
This guy's full of crap.
Hey,

09:56.997 --> 09:58.899
all right.
It's time to go, gentlemen.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.133
Oh!
What?!

10:00.167 --> 10:01.301
See you later.

10:01.334 --> 10:02.803
Let's go.
Yeah, enjoy your train

10:02.836 --> 10:03.837
back to nowhere.
Come on, man.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.172
Let's go.
Choo, choo!

10:05.205 --> 10:06.473
Let's go.
Choo, choo!

10:06.506 --> 10:07.841
In the back, boys.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.910
Enjoy your cheese
with your whine.

10:09.943 --> 10:11.144
(whooping)
(yells indistinctly)

10:11.178 --> 10:12.813
Yeah!

10:12.846 --> 10:14.347
That is
what I am talking about.

10:14.381 --> 10:15.749
And that, my friend...

10:15.783 --> 10:18.752
is the nacho special.

10:18.786 --> 10:21.521
There you go.
Don't eat the peanut shells.

10:21.554 --> 10:22.990
Hey, why'd they
get kicked out?

10:23.023 --> 10:24.992
The opposing fan
always gets kicked out.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.860
That's the rule.
Otherwise people would just be

10:26.894 --> 10:28.428
hammering 'em the whole game.

10:28.461 --> 10:31.464
Now that the cancer is gone,
we can enjoy ourselves.

10:32.700 --> 10:34.634
They had cancer?

10:36.203 --> 10:37.771
No.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.873
No, no, I hope not.

10:39.907 --> 10:41.541
Geez.

10:41.574 --> 10:44.044
If that were the case,
I'd feel really terrible.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.645
Peanuts.

10:49.549 --> 10:51.518
This is more like it.

10:51.551 --> 10:54.221
Hello, I'm Brian. I'll be
your in-suite concierge today.

10:54.254 --> 10:55.622
Will anyone else
be joining us?

10:55.655 --> 10:57.557
Not today, Brian.
Just me.

10:57.590 --> 10:59.459
Wonderful.
Well, make yourself at home.

10:59.492 --> 11:01.128
We've got food
right over here,

11:01.161 --> 11:02.629
everything from hot dogs
to sushi.

11:02.662 --> 11:04.464
Fridge is fully stocked.
TVs can be tuned

11:04.497 --> 11:06.366
to any channel you'd like.
And, of course,

11:06.399 --> 11:07.868
view's not too bad.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.636
Can I start you
with something to drink?

11:09.669 --> 11:11.304
I could do a water.

11:11.338 --> 11:12.639
Still or sparkling?

11:12.672 --> 11:14.374
Let's go with bubbles.

11:14.407 --> 11:15.475
Coming right up.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.577
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

11:17.610 --> 11:19.079
Ah.

11:19.112 --> 11:20.413
Row QQ.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.215
(snorts)

11:22.249 --> 11:25.218
Ladies, here's the check,
whenever you're ready.

11:25.252 --> 11:27.721
Mmm.
And this is from
the gentleman at the bar.

11:27.755 --> 11:31.324
Oh, how nice.

11:31.358 --> 11:33.927
That means nothing.
It happens to me all the time.

11:33.961 --> 11:35.328
Oh, really? When was the last
time it happened to you?

11:35.362 --> 11:37.497
Literally
every single day of my life.

11:37.530 --> 11:39.332
Now let's roll.
I want to be down at the docks

11:39.366 --> 11:41.168
when the fishing boats come in.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.670
See what those guys think
of your new look.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.273
Uh, ugh. Okay, here we go.

11:46.306 --> 11:49.076
What's this?
That's the check.
That's for you.

11:49.109 --> 11:50.778
What do you mean it's for me?
I left my credit card

11:50.811 --> 11:52.012
for the boob deposit.

11:52.045 --> 11:53.013
Well, I don't have any money.

11:53.046 --> 11:54.514
How do you not have any money?

11:54.547 --> 11:55.515
I don't know, Sabrina,

11:55.548 --> 11:57.184
I guess the Dow had a bad day.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.452
You literally said, "Let
me take you to brunch."

11:59.486 --> 12:01.188
And I did. I brought you here.
I didn't realize

12:01.221 --> 12:02.689
I was gonna have
to pay for it also.

12:02.722 --> 12:04.024
I'm not the one
who had 11 Bellinis.

12:04.057 --> 12:05.025
I didn't realize they were gonna

12:05.058 --> 12:06.459
be so teeny-tiny and delicious.

12:06.493 --> 12:08.361
Well, what the hell
are we gonna do?

12:08.395 --> 12:10.197
Just relax, okay?
We'll just sneak out of here

12:10.230 --> 12:11.631
without paying.
I do it all the time.

12:11.664 --> 12:13.433
You do it all the time?

12:13.466 --> 12:15.135
Here's how it's gonna go down.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.469
You're gonna go to the bathroom.

12:16.503 --> 12:18.105
I'm gonna count
to ten Mississippi.

12:18.138 --> 12:20.540
And then I'm just gonna
slip out of here, unnoticed,

12:20.573 --> 12:23.043
like a fart in a Jacuzzi.
You got me?

12:23.076 --> 12:25.378
Good luck with that.
Okay. Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

12:25.412 --> 12:26.713
Give me the boobs.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.515
What? Why?

12:30.083 --> 12:32.519
Because I feel more confident
with them, all right?

12:33.921 --> 12:35.155
Shut up and give 'em to me.
Told you.

12:35.188 --> 12:38.058
Shut up.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.759
You love 'em.

12:41.094 --> 12:43.296
(whispering):
God, I hate you so much...

12:43.330 --> 12:46.166
Let's go, ladies, you and me.

12:51.872 --> 12:52.840
Um, excuse me, miss.

12:52.873 --> 12:55.675
Oh, yeah.
Um, here's the thing.

12:56.443 --> 12:58.111
(people groaning)

13:00.113 --> 13:02.082
Did you see that?
'Cause

13:02.115 --> 13:03.616
you must be wondering...

13:06.719 --> 13:09.022
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
(screams)

13:09.056 --> 13:10.757
(groans)
You all right?

13:10.790 --> 13:13.293
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

13:18.798 --> 13:19.933
Mickey?

13:19.967 --> 13:22.936
Huh? Oh.
(panting)

13:22.970 --> 13:24.371
What the hell
happened to you?

13:24.404 --> 13:25.705
Nothing. It was perfect.

13:26.806 --> 13:27.841
Where's the boob?

13:27.875 --> 13:29.109
What?
The boob.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.110
You're missing a boob.
Oh.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.279
Oh...

13:32.312 --> 13:34.047
That's not good.

13:37.885 --> 13:40.453
...crazy. She must have been on,
like, PCP or, like, bath salts

13:40.487 --> 13:42.389
or, you know, one of those,
like, superhuman drugs.

13:42.422 --> 13:44.791
And she had these
huge, crazy, fake boobs.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.027
What the hell
did you do in there?

13:47.060 --> 13:48.361
Tough to say.

13:48.395 --> 13:50.130
It all happened pretty fast.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.865
I can tell you it was loud.

13:51.899 --> 13:53.366
All right, well, go in there

13:53.400 --> 13:55.235
and turn yourself in
and get our boob back.

13:55.268 --> 13:57.304
(chuckles)
No.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.306
Are you serious?

13:59.339 --> 14:00.807
You will spend
one night in jail.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.375
That boob costs five grand.

14:02.409 --> 14:03.410
Do the math.

14:03.443 --> 14:04.811
Yeah. That plan sucks.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.813
I'm calling Alba.
What? Why?

14:06.846 --> 14:08.415
Because she's reliable and
she's down for anything.

14:08.448 --> 14:09.749
Watch this.

14:09.782 --> 14:10.984
(line rings)
ALBA: What do you need?

14:11.018 --> 14:12.819
Yo, Alba. Hey,
I need your help

14:12.852 --> 14:14.421
getting a breast implant
from a crime scene.

14:14.454 --> 14:16.089
Drop a pin.
I'm on my way.

14:16.123 --> 14:17.490
Boom.

14:17.524 --> 14:20.260
I got to tell you, Brian.

14:20.293 --> 14:22.095
I was pretty
skeptical coming in,

14:22.129 --> 14:24.664
but now I am
totally sold

14:24.697 --> 14:26.666
on the whole live
sports experience.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.601
Well, thanks for spending it
with us, Chip.

14:28.635 --> 14:30.003
It was a pleasure
serving you.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.271
You're welcome.

14:31.304 --> 14:32.339
Can I help you
with a ride home?

14:32.372 --> 14:33.440
You guys do that?

14:33.473 --> 14:35.342
I'll call a car service.

14:35.375 --> 14:38.178
I frickin' love sports.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.213
All right, huh?

14:40.247 --> 14:41.848
Thank you for your service.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.883
Never check you
on the way out.

14:45.318 --> 14:47.520
(whoops)
(phone buzzes)

14:47.554 --> 14:49.089
Whoa.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.091
Ah. Chip got a ride home.

14:51.124 --> 14:53.060
There's hope for him yet.

14:54.962 --> 14:57.097
What's up, guy?
Remember us?

14:57.130 --> 14:58.431
Oh, right. Hey, fellas.

14:58.465 --> 14:59.866
You missed a good one.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.701
In case you couldn't
tell by the cheers,

15:01.734 --> 15:04.637
Tom Brady jammed his size 12
Australian slipper boot

15:04.671 --> 15:06.940
right up your cheesy cornholes.

15:06.974 --> 15:09.142
You got a big mouth, buddy.
You're lucky you're with

15:09.176 --> 15:10.877
your son or we'd roll
on your ass right here.

15:10.910 --> 15:12.279
Yeah. Hey, Ben.

15:12.312 --> 15:15.115
Don't worry about this,
all right? I got it.

15:15.148 --> 15:17.350
Pay attention.

15:19.486 --> 15:21.188
He's not my son.

15:22.422 --> 15:25.158
(grunting)

15:25.192 --> 15:27.460
Ben, this is all part of it.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.063
It's all right, Ben.
I'm in control. (grunts)

15:30.097 --> 15:32.232
(grunting and groaning)

15:32.265 --> 15:34.634
Why aren't we moving?

15:34.667 --> 15:37.737
Sorry, sir. There's people
fighting in the road.

15:37.770 --> 15:41.308
Animals.

15:41.341 --> 15:42.742
(horn honking)

15:42.775 --> 15:44.344
(grunting)

15:48.115 --> 15:50.517
(Mickey sighs)

15:50.550 --> 15:52.185
(laughing)

15:52.219 --> 15:55.088
You're a good man, Johnny.

15:55.122 --> 15:57.857
You go back to school
for you.

15:57.890 --> 16:00.093
(whoops)

16:00.127 --> 16:01.494
Hey!

16:01.528 --> 16:04.031
Alba. Are you drunk?

16:04.064 --> 16:05.932
No.

16:05.965 --> 16:08.201
I'm doing mushrooms.

16:08.235 --> 16:10.803
(laughing)

16:13.140 --> 16:15.642
(laughing and wheezing)

16:19.812 --> 16:21.281
Uh, all right. Alba.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.150
(laughing)

16:24.751 --> 16:27.054
(snorts)
Hey, Alba.

16:27.087 --> 16:28.188
And you're drunk.

16:28.221 --> 16:29.889
What? N-- Oh...

16:29.922 --> 16:30.890
That's right.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.892
I forgot. Girls' day!

16:32.925 --> 16:35.028
This is reliable?
I wasn't planning on this.

16:35.062 --> 16:36.629
Alba, where did you
get mushrooms?

16:36.663 --> 16:39.299
Shh. Let's not get off track.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.967
Catch me up to speed.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.635
Okay. We were having brunch
over in that restaurant.

16:42.669 --> 16:43.636
And we were doing
a boob thing.

16:43.670 --> 16:45.372
Did I hear you say brunch?

16:45.405 --> 16:47.140
You're having brunch without me?

16:47.174 --> 16:49.542
No, but it-it wasn't like that.
No? What's it like, then?

16:49.576 --> 16:50.410
We were doing a social
experiment,

16:50.443 --> 16:51.311
and one of the boob...
You guys,

16:51.344 --> 16:52.479
pull it together, okay?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.081
Alba, are you gonna
help us or not?

16:55.082 --> 16:56.983
Fine.

16:57.016 --> 16:59.886
But we are gonna double back
to this brunch business later.

16:59.919 --> 17:02.555
Understood.
Where is it?

17:02.589 --> 17:04.857
Unclear. It kind of pinballed
all over the place in there.

17:04.891 --> 17:05.892
Why don't you just head on in

17:05.925 --> 17:07.060
and I'll walk you through it,
okay?

17:07.094 --> 17:10.997
One boobie coming up, okay?

17:11.030 --> 17:14.434
Awe... some.

17:14.467 --> 17:16.002
Oh yeah!

17:16.035 --> 17:17.770
It's okay, it's finished.

17:17.804 --> 17:19.806
(laughs)

17:21.941 --> 17:23.843
Alba's really going
for it lately, huh?

17:23.876 --> 17:25.278
Oh, yeah. She's nuts.

17:25.312 --> 17:26.613
I was encouraging it
for a while,

17:26.646 --> 17:28.047
but she's steering
the ship now.

17:35.222 --> 17:37.224
(phone rings)

17:39.058 --> 17:40.360
Hello.

17:40.393 --> 17:41.694
MICKEY:
Okay, let's do this.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.196
Yeah. Who is this?

17:43.230 --> 17:45.365
It's Mickey.

17:45.398 --> 17:46.933
(laughing):
Mickey.

17:46.966 --> 17:49.136
Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Where am I going?

17:49.169 --> 17:51.037
Okay. First you're gonna
have to get past that host.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.605
Hi. Can I help you?

17:52.639 --> 17:53.706
I doubt it.

17:53.740 --> 17:54.874
Okay, I'm in.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.042
Wow. That was awesome.

17:56.075 --> 17:58.044
Okay, turn right. Kind of start
heading towards the bar.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.546
We were at a little table
in the middle.

17:59.579 --> 18:03.316
Oh. That must have been
so nice for you.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.318
Have some drinks,
a little of...

18:05.352 --> 18:06.886
Alba. Focus, okay?

18:06.919 --> 18:08.321
Do you see the black guy
with the red hat?

18:08.355 --> 18:11.458
Black guy with red hair?

18:11.491 --> 18:15.662
(laughing):
Oh, no. I never seen anything
like that ever.

18:15.695 --> 18:18.064
Not black guy with red hair,
black guy with red hat.

18:18.097 --> 18:22.001
Oh. Black guy, red hat.

18:22.034 --> 18:23.570
(Alba laughs)

18:23.603 --> 18:25.905
(laughing and wheezing)

18:25.938 --> 18:27.474
Yeah. I see him.

18:27.507 --> 18:29.008
I see him.
Okay, but keep your voice down.

18:29.041 --> 18:30.009
Can he hear you?

18:30.042 --> 18:31.844
Yeah.

18:31.878 --> 18:33.413
He's looking right at me.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.847
What do you want me
to say to him?

18:34.881 --> 18:37.016
I don't want you to say
anything to him.

18:37.049 --> 18:39.519
Just shut up and listen
to the instructions, okay?

18:39.552 --> 18:40.620
I-I'm gonna kill her.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.424
Oh, oh.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.592
I got eyes on it.

18:45.625 --> 18:48.328
Where? You do?

18:48.361 --> 18:49.929
Uh-oh, uh-oh.

18:49.962 --> 18:52.332
Boobie on the move.
Coming right your way.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.866
Wh-Where? I don't see it.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.535
Uh, white baby, blonde hair.

18:55.568 --> 18:56.703
You don't have to say
"white baby," just say "baby."

18:56.736 --> 18:58.605
I see him. I got it. Okay.

18:58.638 --> 19:00.139
God.

19:02.209 --> 19:03.776
Excuse me, excuse me.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.378
Ma'am. Hi there.
Uh, I think your baby

19:05.412 --> 19:07.680
stole something of mine
off the restaurant floor.

19:07.714 --> 19:08.948
SABRINA:
Yeah.

19:08.981 --> 19:10.783
Oh, gosh. I'm so sorry.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.452
He's such a little thief.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.953
(laughing):
That's okay.
He's so adorable.

19:13.986 --> 19:15.522
Isn't he, though?
Yeah. He's so cute.

19:15.555 --> 19:17.624
Oh, I hope you don't
mind a little drool.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.625
Not at all.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.126
What is this, anyway?

19:20.159 --> 19:21.961
Oh, nice. You found
your breast implant.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.296
Good for you.

19:23.330 --> 19:24.731
Oh, gross!

19:24.764 --> 19:26.065
No. No, no!
Wait!

19:27.066 --> 19:28.568
No!
No! Oh, come on.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.307
BEN:
Why are you crying?

19:34.341 --> 19:36.476
(sighs)

19:36.509 --> 19:40.146
'Cause men cry, too, Ben.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.316
Men cry, too.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.318
Thanks for driving, by the way.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.720
You're welcome.

19:47.754 --> 19:49.989
You're a real natural, huh?

19:50.022 --> 19:53.660
Don't be afraid
to use that horn.

19:53.693 --> 19:55.728
(horn honks)

19:55.762 --> 19:58.598
(laughs)
Yeah. Let 'em know
you're coming.

19:58.631 --> 19:59.832
Oh, come on.

19:59.866 --> 20:01.401
Make the light,
make the light.

20:01.434 --> 20:02.769
(engine revs, car horns honk)

20:05.204 --> 20:07.173
What happened to it?

20:07.206 --> 20:08.841
Well, I don't know.

20:08.875 --> 20:10.343
You tell me, Doc.

20:10.377 --> 20:12.111
The damn thing
just exploded.

20:12.144 --> 20:13.613
Yeah. We're lucky
that grenade wasn't inside me.

20:13.646 --> 20:14.947
I mean...
Yeah.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.416
It could have been
really bad.
Oh.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.518
Obviously, we'll have
to charge you for this.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.253
Look, I'm gonna pass
on the surgery.

20:20.287 --> 20:21.521
Just take it out of that.

20:21.554 --> 20:22.855
You are?

20:22.889 --> 20:24.257
Yeah. I don't want
the memory of today

20:24.291 --> 20:25.692
physically attached
to my body.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.694
I'll hold off for now.

20:27.727 --> 20:28.861
Okay.

20:28.895 --> 20:30.297
So my plan worked.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.299
No. It did not.

20:32.332 --> 20:33.866
Well, obviously it did.
You heard her, Goodby.

20:33.900 --> 20:35.368
She's not getting the surgery.

20:35.402 --> 20:36.636
You can give us the
rest of the cash.

20:36.669 --> 20:38.204
This is a doctor's office.

20:38.237 --> 20:39.906
We don't do refunds.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.214
Mmm.

20:48.247 --> 20:50.550
I don't know.
Did you get a haircut?

20:50.583 --> 20:52.319
No, no. Look harder.

20:52.352 --> 20:53.720
Color contacts?

20:53.753 --> 20:54.987
No, come on. Guys.

20:55.021 --> 20:56.623
I got my knees done.

20:56.656 --> 20:58.325
That's a thing?

20:58.358 --> 21:00.893
Yeah. I guess it's a
super common procedure.

21:00.927 --> 21:02.995
Ay. What was wrong
with your old knees?

21:03.029 --> 21:04.997
Those knees were trash,
these ones are awesome.

21:05.031 --> 21:06.833
I honestly can't even
tell the difference.
Mm.

21:06.866 --> 21:09.068
Well, that's a testament
to Dr. Goodby, isn't it?

21:09.101 --> 21:10.570
Woman is amazing.

21:10.603 --> 21:13.172
Hey. Whoa.

21:13.205 --> 21:14.240
How was the game?

21:14.273 --> 21:15.742
I fell down the stairs.
Fun.

21:15.775 --> 21:17.410
Mm-hmm. Yeah, I can see that.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.412
Yeah. I botched the first one
and then just kind of...

21:19.446 --> 21:20.847
Oh, yeah.
...rode it out.

21:20.880 --> 21:22.248
Sure. You have to at that point.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.083
Wow.

21:24.116 --> 21:25.918
You look great.

21:25.952 --> 21:28.287
Did you do something
to your knees?

21:34.561 --> 21:36.028
ALBA:
I'm doing mushrooms.
