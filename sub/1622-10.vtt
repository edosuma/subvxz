and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

03:40.570 --> 03:42.420
What are you doing?

03:42.490 --> 03:44.080
I have a list.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.040
A list of people you mean to kill?

03:46.120 --> 03:48.590
For laughing at me?
Do I look like Joffrey to you?

03:49.540 --> 03:51.460
No, death seems a bit extreme.

03:51.540 --> 03:53.470
Fear of death, on the other hand...

03:53.540 --> 03:55.170
You should learn to ignore them.

03:55.250 --> 03:57.130
My lady, people have been laughing at me

03:57.260 --> 03:59.130
far longer than they've
been laughing at you.

03:59.800 --> 04:03.300
I'm the half man, the
Demon Monkey, the Imp.

04:03.390 --> 04:04.810
You're a Lannister.

04:04.890 --> 04:08.230
I am the disgraced daughter
of the traitor Ned Stark.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.990
The disgraced daughter
and the Demon Monkey.

04:11.060 --> 04:12.220
We're perfect for each other.

04:12.230 --> 04:13.230
(CHUCKLES)

04:16.649 --> 04:18.740
So how should we punish them?

04:18.820 --> 04:20.240
Who? Whom?

04:20.490 --> 04:23.240
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield
and Lord Desmond Crakehall.

04:23.320 --> 04:24.920
Ah!

04:24.990 --> 04:28.420
I could speak to Lord Varys
and learn their perversions.

04:28.500 --> 04:31.920
Anyone named
Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert.

04:32.170 --> 04:34.290
I hear that you're a pervert.

04:34.420 --> 04:35.670
I am the Imp.

04:35.750 --> 04:37.050
I have certain standards to maintain.

04:37.170 --> 04:38.470
(CHUCKLES)

04:40.340 --> 04:43.340
We could sheep shift Lord Desmond's bed.

04:43.550 --> 04:45.430
You cut a little hole in his mattress

04:45.600 --> 04:47.520
and you stuff sheep dung inside.

04:47.600 --> 04:50.650
Then you sew up the hole
and make his bed again.

04:50.730 --> 04:53.450
His room will stink,
but he won't know where it's coming from.

04:53.520 --> 04:55.070
Lady Sansa!

04:55.150 --> 04:57.530
My sister used to do that
when she was angry with me.

04:57.610 --> 05:00.030
And she was always angry with me.

05:00.110 --> 05:02.080
Why "sheep shift"?

05:02.150 --> 05:05.580
That's the vulgar word for "dung."

05:06.450 --> 05:07.580
My lady...

05:07.660 --> 05:09.000
Well, you asked me.

05:09.450 --> 05:10.500
(BOTH EXCLAIMING)

05:10.580 --> 05:11.710
That's him!

05:13.120 --> 05:15.050
My lord, my lady.

05:15.130 --> 05:18.100
Your father has called
a meeting of the Small Council.

05:25.510 --> 05:27.760
Killed a few puppies today?

05:28.600 --> 05:29.770
Show him.

05:29.850 --> 05:31.570
Come on, show him.

05:35.900 --> 05:37.270
PYCELLE: Oh!

05:37.480 --> 05:40.830
Apologies, my lord. Old fingers.

05:48.830 --> 05:51.620
"Roslin caught a fine fat trout.

05:52.500 --> 05:56.250
"Her brothers gave her
a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding."

05:56.330 --> 05:59.010
Signed, "Walder Frey."

06:00.920 --> 06:04.850
Is that bad poetry
or is it supposed to mean something?

06:04.930 --> 06:06.890
Robb Stark is dead. (LAUGHING)

06:07.550 --> 06:09.810
And his bitch mother.

06:11.270 --> 06:12.730
Write back to Lord Frey.

06:12.810 --> 06:18.570
Thank him for his service and command
him to send Robb Stark's head.

06:18.650 --> 06:21.740
I'm going to
serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast.

06:21.820 --> 06:25.240
Your Grace, Lady Sansa
is your aunt by marriage.

06:25.320 --> 06:27.740
A joke. Joffrey did not mean it.

06:27.820 --> 06:29.420
Yes, I did.

06:29.490 --> 06:32.420
I'm going to have it
served to Sansa at my wedding feast.

06:32.490 --> 06:33.870
TYRION: No.

06:33.950 --> 06:36.210
She is no longer yours to torment.

06:37.080 --> 06:39.710
Everyone is mine to torment.

06:41.710 --> 06:44.510
You'd do well
to remember that, you little monster.

06:44.590 --> 06:46.470
Oh, I'm a monster.

06:46.550 --> 06:49.980
Perhaps you should speak
to me more softly, then.

06:50.050 --> 06:56.810
Monsters are dangerous,
and just now kings are dying like flies.

07:03.650 --> 07:07.410
I could have your tongue
out for saying that.

07:08.070 --> 07:10.450
Let him make his threats.

07:10.530 --> 07:11.530
Hmm?

07:11.620 --> 07:13.490
He's a bitter little man.

07:13.580 --> 07:16.630
Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately.

07:16.710 --> 07:21.710
Unacceptable, disrespectful,
and in very bad taste.

07:21.790 --> 07:24.390
I am the King!

07:24.710 --> 07:26.180
I will punish you.

07:26.260 --> 07:30.480
Any man who must say,
"I am the King," is no true king.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.220
I'll make sure you understand that

07:33.350 --> 07:34.970
when I've won your war for you.

07:35.100 --> 07:39.350
My father won the real war.
He killed Prince Rhaegar.

07:39.440 --> 07:43.410
He took the crown
while you hid under Casterly Rock!

07:56.160 --> 08:00.420
The King is tired. See him to his chambers.

08:00.500 --> 08:02.380
- Come along.
- I'm not tired.

08:02.460 --> 08:04.430
We have so much to celebrate.

08:05.460 --> 08:08.140
A wedding to plan. You must rest.

08:10.180 --> 08:13.270
Grand Maester,
perhaps some essence of nightshade

08:13.350 --> 08:15.720
to help him sleep.

08:15.810 --> 08:19.150
I'm not tired!

08:20.480 --> 08:21.480
CERSEI: Come.

08:34.530 --> 08:36.080
(DOOR OPENING)

08:42.830 --> 08:44.300
Not you.

08:52.010 --> 08:54.100
You just sent the most powerful man

08:54.220 --> 08:56.310
in Westeros to bed without his supper.

08:57.060 --> 09:00.430
You're a fool if you believe he's the
most powerful man in Westeros.

09:00.520 --> 09:03.570
A treasonous statement. Joffrey is King.

09:03.650 --> 09:06.270
You really think a crown gives you power?

09:08.280 --> 09:09.400
No.

09:10.280 --> 09:12.250
I think armies give you power.

09:12.320 --> 09:13.910
Mmm-hmm.

09:13.990 --> 09:17.240
Robb Stark had one, never lost a battle,

09:17.700 --> 09:20.120
and you defeated him all the same.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.300
Mmm-hmm.

09:21.370 --> 09:23.290
Oh, I know.

09:23.370 --> 09:26.220
Walder Frey gets all the credit.

09:26.290 --> 09:29.970
Or the blame, I suppose,
depending on your allegiance.

09:31.550 --> 09:34.550
Walder Frey is many
things, but a brave man?

09:35.390 --> 09:36.640
No.

09:37.930 --> 09:40.230
He never would have risked such an action

09:40.390 --> 09:42.690
if he didn't have certain assurances.

09:42.770 --> 09:44.900
Which he got from me.

09:45.560 --> 09:47.530
Do you disapprove?

09:47.610 --> 09:49.480
I'm all for cheating. This is war.

09:49.570 --> 09:51.690
But to slaughter them at a wedding...

09:51.780 --> 09:54.530
Explain to me why it is more noble

09:54.610 --> 09:57.830
to kill 10,000 men in battle
than a dozen at dinner.

09:57.910 --> 10:01.580
So that's why you did it? To save lives?

10:01.700 --> 10:04.830
To end the war. To protect the family.

10:04.920 --> 10:07.590
Do you want to write a song
for the dead Starks?

10:08.170 --> 10:10.340
Go ahead, write one.

10:10.670 --> 10:14.020
I'm in this world a little while longer

10:14.090 --> 10:17.810
to defend the Lannisters,
to defend my blood.

10:17.890 --> 10:20.360
The Northerners will never forget.

10:20.430 --> 10:21.900
Good.

10:21.970 --> 10:25.770
Let them remember
what happens when they march on the South.

10:28.060 --> 10:29.660
All the Stark men are dead.

10:30.770 --> 10:32.700
Winterfell is a ruin.

10:33.650 --> 10:37.450
Roose Bolton will be named
Warden of the North

10:38.320 --> 10:42.290
until your son by Sansa comes of age.

10:45.580 --> 10:49.050
I believe you
still have some work to do on that score.

10:50.420 --> 10:53.510
Do you think she'll open her legs for me

10:53.590 --> 10:57.060
after I tell her
how we murdered her mother and brother?

10:57.130 --> 11:00.260
One way or another,
you will get that girl pregnant.

11:00.350 --> 11:02.640
I will not rape her.

11:04.310 --> 11:07.400
Shall I explain to you
in one easy lesson how the world works?

11:07.480 --> 11:10.360
Use small words. I'm not as bright as you.

11:10.440 --> 11:13.530
The house that
puts family first will always defeat

11:13.610 --> 11:15.740
the house that puts the whims and wishes

11:15.860 --> 11:17.990
of its sons and daughters first.

11:19.360 --> 11:21.540
A good man does everything in his power

11:21.660 --> 11:23.880
to better his family's position,

11:24.830 --> 11:28.210
regardless of his own selfish desires.

11:32.250 --> 11:33.930
Does that amuse you?

11:34.000 --> 11:36.380
No, it's a very good lesson.

11:36.460 --> 11:39.590
Only it's easy for you
to preach utter devotion to family

11:39.680 --> 11:42.350
when you're making all the decisions.

11:42.430 --> 11:44.270
Easy for me, is it?

11:44.350 --> 11:47.730
When have you ever done something
that wasn't in your interest,

11:47.810 --> 11:49.980
but solely for the benefit of the family?

11:50.060 --> 11:52.660
The day that you were born.

11:57.320 --> 11:59.240
I wanted to carry you into the sea

11:59.360 --> 12:01.330
and let the waves wash you away.

12:03.870 --> 12:06.040
Instead, I let you live.

12:07.410 --> 12:09.710
And I brought you up as my son.

12:14.040 --> 12:15.470
Because you're a Lannister.

12:21.890 --> 12:23.390
(DOOR CLOSES)

12:31.690 --> 12:32.860
Sansa.

13:02.430 --> 13:03.770
It's empty-

13:03.890 --> 13:05.180
Let's find a place to sleep.

Hodor.

13:16.900 --> 13:17.900
(ECHOING)

13:18.360 --> 13:19.910
Hodor.

13:19.980 --> 13:21.990
Don't, Hodor.

13:27.370 --> 13:28.910
BRANDON: Maybe we shouldn't stay here.

13:28.990 --> 13:31.000
You'd rather be out there?

13:31.910 --> 13:34.790
There are a lot of stories
about this place.

13:35.750 --> 13:37.300
Horrible stories.

13:37.380 --> 13:39.430
I always quite liked the horrible stories.

13:39.710 --> 13:42.180
So did I. Once.

13:45.930 --> 13:47.730
You ever heard about the Rat Cook?

13:47.800 --> 13:50.060
No. Who's he?

13:50.140 --> 13:52.610
Just a cook in the Night's Watch.

13:53.180 --> 13:57.440
He was angry at
the King for something, I don't remember.

13:57.810 --> 14:00.570
When the King was visiting the Nightfort,

14:00.650 --> 14:02.900
the cook killed the King's son,

14:02.990 --> 14:07.660
cooked him into a big pie
with onions, carrots, mushrooms, and bacon.

14:08.780 --> 14:11.830
That night he sewed the pie to the King.

14:12.660 --> 14:17.510
He liked the taste of his son so
much, he asked for a second slice.

14:19.750 --> 14:22.970
The Gods turned the cook
into a giant white rat

14:23.420 --> 14:25.430
who could only eat his own young.

14:25.760 --> 14:30.860
He's been roaming the Nightfort ever
since, devouring his own babies.

14:32.100 --> 14:37.070
But no matter what he does,
he's always hungry.

14:38.150 --> 14:41.280
If the Gods turned every killer
into a giant white rat...

14:41.360 --> 14:43.780
it wasn't for murder
the Gods cursed the Rat Cook

14:43.860 --> 14:46.580
or for sewing the King's son in a pie.

14:46.700 --> 14:48.950
He killed a guest beneath his roof.

14:51.030 --> 14:53.880
That's something the Gods can't forgive.

15:00.750 --> 15:04.600
"The late Walder Frey," old Tully called me

15:04.670 --> 15:08.300
because I didn't get
my men to the Trident in time for battle.

15:08.380 --> 15:10.510
He thought he was witty.

15:10.890 --> 15:13.140
Look at us now, Tully.

15:13.220 --> 15:17.070
You're dead,
your daughter's dead, your grandson's dead,

15:17.690 --> 15:20.560
your son spent
his wedding night in a dungeon,

15:20.650 --> 15:23.620
and I'm Lord of Riverrun.

15:23.860 --> 15:25.110
(LAUGHING)

15:25.190 --> 15:27.070
The Blackfish escaped.

15:29.200 --> 15:32.370
An old man on the run with no allies.

15:33.580 --> 15:35.450
I have Tywin Lannister backing me.

15:35.540 --> 15:36.750
Who does he have?

15:36.910 --> 15:38.170
As you say.

15:38.710 --> 15:42.210
They all laughed at me,
all those high lords.

15:42.290 --> 15:45.300
They all thought they were better than me.

15:45.380 --> 15:48.010
Ned Stark, Hoster Tully.

15:48.760 --> 15:51.350
People snigger when I marry a young girl,

15:51.430 --> 15:55.020
but who said a word when Jon Arryn
married the little Tully bitch?

15:55.100 --> 15:57.020
You'll be needing a new young girl.

15:57.100 --> 15:58.440
Yeah.

15:59.440 --> 16:01.730
Got that to look forward to.

16:02.020 --> 16:03.190
Hmm.

16:03.270 --> 16:06.990
And you, the Warden of the North.

16:07.280 --> 16:10.250
No more Starks to bow and scrape to.

16:10.610 --> 16:14.120
Must have been torture following that
stupid boy all over the country.

16:14.410 --> 16:16.790
He ignored my advice at every turn.

16:16.950 --> 16:19.330
If he'd been a trifle less arrogant...

16:19.410 --> 16:23.640
Calling himself
the "Young Wolf." How's that for pomposity?

16:23.960 --> 16:25.210
(WALDER CHUCKLES)

16:25.300 --> 16:28.170
Well, here's to the Young Wolf!

16:28.510 --> 16:29.510
(HOWLS)

16:30.010 --> 16:31.350
Forever young.

Will you move to Winterfell
now that the war's over?

16:39.890 --> 16:41.690
At some point perhaps.

16:42.520 --> 16:44.400
But Winterfell's in ruins.

16:44.480 --> 16:45.950
Yeah.

16:47.650 --> 16:52.250
What happened up there?
I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place.

16:52.320 --> 16:57.200
I heard he killed all the ravens.
And after that, nothing.

16:57.540 --> 17:00.330
I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out.

17:01.210 --> 17:05.710
Robb Stark offered amnesty for the
ironborn if they gave us Theon.

17:05.920 --> 17:07.470
Oh. And?

17:07.550 --> 17:09.260
Ramsay delivered the terms.

17:09.339 --> 17:13.560
The ironborn turned on Theon,
as we knew they would.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.599
They handed him over trussed and hooded.

17:16.800 --> 17:19.270
But Ramsay, well...

17:20.930 --> 17:23.400
Ramsay has his own way of doing things.

17:24.440 --> 17:28.069
Well, the girls weren't
lying. You had a good-sized cock.

17:36.740 --> 17:38.210
What?

17:38.490 --> 17:39.750
No.

17:42.330 --> 17:44.050
Pork sausage. (LAUGHS)

17:44.790 --> 17:46.790
You think I'm some sort of savage?

17:58.720 --> 18:01.570
People talk about phantom limbs.

18:02.060 --> 18:05.650
An amputee might
have an itch where his foot used to be.

18:05.730 --> 18:07.570
So I've always wondered,

18:11.150 --> 18:14.450
do eunuchs have a phantom cock?

18:16.030 --> 18:18.200
Next time you think about naked girls,

18:19.160 --> 18:21.080
will you feel an itch?

18:22.580 --> 18:24.920
(WEEPING)

18:29.090 --> 18:30.430
Sorry.

18:31.920 --> 18:33.890
I shouldn't make jokes.

18:35.470 --> 18:38.090
My mother taught me
not to throw stones at cripples.

18:38.260 --> 18:40.360
(WHIMPERING)

18:42.020 --> 18:45.490
But my father taught me
to aim for their head.

18:45.850 --> 18:47.270
(SOFTLY) Kill me.

18:47.770 --> 18:49.270
Sorry, what?

18:50.770 --> 18:52.450
Kill me.

18:54.440 --> 18:55.790
A little louder.

18:56.570 --> 18:58.160
Kill me!

19:00.870 --> 19:04.370
You're no good to me dead. We need you.

19:21.640 --> 19:23.010
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

19:25.180 --> 19:28.690
You don't look like a
Theon Greyjoy anymore.

19:30.190 --> 19:32.240
That's a name for a lord.

19:33.610 --> 19:36.990
But you're not a lord, are you?

19:37.900 --> 19:40.450
You're just meat.

19:40.780 --> 19:42.200
(GRUNTS)

19:42.620 --> 19:45.340
Stinking meat.

19:49.330 --> 19:50.800
You reek.

19:51.920 --> 19:52.970
(GASPS)

19:53.040 --> 19:54.590
Reek!

19:54.670 --> 19:56.760
That's a good name for you.

19:57.510 --> 19:58.720
What's your name?

20:01.180 --> 20:02.680
Theon Greyjoy.

20:03.510 --> 20:04.810
(GROANS)

20:08.270 --> 20:09.860
What's your name?

20:13.940 --> 20:15.990
Theon Greyjoy.

20:23.530 --> 20:24.630
Please.

20:24.700 --> 20:28.750
What is your name?

20:31.330 --> 20:32.460
Reek.

20:36.130 --> 20:37.680
My name is...

20:39.380 --> 20:40.880
Reek.

Gilly. Don't hurt us.

21:49.200 --> 21:50.950
Where are you going?

21:51.040 --> 21:54.510
To Castle Black.
I'm a brother of the Night's Watch.

21:54.580 --> 21:55.670
My brother, he's in the Night's...

21:55.750 --> 21:56.750
(SHUSHES)

21:56.830 --> 21:58.640

21:58.920 --> 22:00.470
(SUMMER GROWLING)

22:07.510 --> 22:08.890
You're Jon's brother.

22:10.180 --> 22:11.500
The one who fell from the window.

22:11.640 --> 22:12.940
No, I'm not.

22:14.310 --> 22:18.490
I've been around Ghost
enough to know a direwolf when I see one.

22:18.900 --> 22:20.900
And I've heard all about Hodor.

22:20.980 --> 22:22.490
Hodor.

22:24.650 --> 22:26.830
I'd be dead if it wasn't for Jon.

22:27.950 --> 22:30.040
If you're his brother,
you're my brother, too.

22:30.160 --> 22:32.290
And anything I can do to help you, I will.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.500
Take us north of the Wall.

22:40.170 --> 22:43.470
What? Why in the world
would you want to go...

22:43.550 --> 22:45.720
I don't want to. I have to.

22:45.800 --> 22:47.120
How did you get through the Wall?

22:47.180 --> 22:50.350
Does the well lead to an underground
river? Is that how you came here?

22:51.060 --> 22:53.020
Come with us.

22:53.100 --> 22:56.270
There are steps carved
into the south side of the Wall.

22:56.350 --> 22:58.200
Hodor can carry you to the top.

22:58.270 --> 23:00.520
We'll walk straight to Castle Black.

23:00.610 --> 23:03.580
Come with us.
There's nothing north but death.

23:04.030 --> 23:08.080
If Jon is alive,
then Castle Black's where he'll be.

23:08.160 --> 23:10.080
It's the safest place for you.

23:10.160 --> 23:12.660
There's nowhere
safe any longer. You know that.

23:12.740 --> 23:14.840
SAMWELL: What I know is what I saw.

23:16.210 --> 23:18.170
And if you saw it, too,
you'd run the other way.

23:18.250 --> 23:21.590
You saw the White Walkers
and the army of the dead.

23:22.590 --> 23:24.180
How do you know all that?

23:24.260 --> 23:26.850
The Night's Watch can't stop them.

23:26.920 --> 23:30.270
The Kings of Westeros
and all their armies can't stop them.

23:37.180 --> 23:38.610
(BABY CRYING)

23:39.480 --> 23:41.480
But you're going to stop them?

23:41.560 --> 23:43.070
Please, Sam.

23:44.360 --> 23:46.240
I have to go north.

23:48.030 --> 23:49.750
I have to.

24:17.980 --> 24:23.360
"Balon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron
Islands and invader of the North.

Get that out of my sight.

25:45.310 --> 25:48.490
Theon disobeyed my orders.

25:52.400 --> 25:54.450
The boy is a fool.

25:57.200 --> 26:00.170
He cannot further the Greyjoy line.

26:01.830 --> 26:05.170
I will not give up the lands I have seized,

26:05.250 --> 26:08.880
the strongholds I have taken.
Get this away from me.

26:10.050 --> 26:11.470
He's your son.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.140
Son?

26:14.550 --> 26:17.270
He's not a man anymore.

26:17.340 --> 26:20.390
He's your son. He's my brother.

26:22.220 --> 26:23.480
He's a Greyjoy.

26:23.560 --> 26:25.230
Watch yourself.

26:26.020 --> 26:27.860
I've made my decision.

26:33.280 --> 26:35.280
And I've made mine.

26:38.450 --> 26:41.250
I'm going to pick the
fastest ship in our fleet.

26:44.080 --> 26:47.000
I'm going to choose
the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands.

26:47.290 --> 26:49.090
MAN: Get those ropes!

26:49.670 --> 26:51.800
YARA: I'm going to sail up the Narrow Sea,

26:51.920 --> 26:54.090
all the way to the Weeping Water.

26:55.420 --> 26:58.520
I'm going to march on the Dreadfort.

26:58.590 --> 27:01.270
I'm going to find my little brother,

27:01.430 --> 27:04.100
and I'm going to bring him home.

27:09.730 --> 27:11.110
What is it?

27:11.520 --> 27:12.820
Dragonglass.

27:12.900 --> 27:14.620
We found them at the Fist.

27:14.900 --> 27:17.620
Someone buried them a long time ago.

27:18.490 --> 27:20.410
Someone wanted us to find them.

27:21.240 --> 27:24.120
Why? What are they for?

27:28.960 --> 27:30.590
Killing White Walkers.

27:30.710 --> 27:32.380
How do you know that?

27:32.460 --> 27:34.430
GILLY: The Walker came for my baby.

27:35.760 --> 27:37.050
And Sam...

27:37.130 --> 27:40.230
But no one's killed
a White Walker in thousands of years.

27:40.300 --> 27:43.980
Well, I suppose someone
had to be the first.

27:44.560 --> 27:46.360
Take it, Hodor.

27:53.320 --> 27:54.910
And the archer.

28:00.740 --> 28:04.990
I got lucky with one of them.

28:05.540 --> 28:06.830
There are more.

28:07.540 --> 28:08.790
Many more.

28:10.710 --> 28:12.760
And for every one of them,

28:13.210 --> 28:14.840
the dead men,

28:16.170 --> 28:17.510
more than you could count.

28:21.550 --> 28:23.300
I wish you'd come with us.

28:24.430 --> 28:26.100
I wish I could.

28:27.640 --> 28:29.440
I really do.

29:17.020 --> 29:18.570
How are you keeping?

29:20.030 --> 29:23.120
Great. Never better.

29:23.360 --> 29:25.490
It was just a bit of blood.

29:26.580 --> 29:28.420
I should have known.

29:28.490 --> 29:31.750
Every time
a highborn asks my name, it's trouble.

29:32.290 --> 29:34.010
We're not really people to you.

29:34.120 --> 29:35.840
Just ways to get what you want.

29:35.920 --> 29:37.090
I'm not a highborn.

29:37.250 --> 29:38.420
She called you "Ser."

29:38.500 --> 29:39.880
I heard it.

29:42.260 --> 29:44.810
A recent state of affairs.

29:48.470 --> 29:51.070
I was born in Flea Bottom, just like you.

29:52.180 --> 29:55.910
Sure, you were.
You're my friend. You're here to help.

29:55.980 --> 29:57.900
I lived below the Street of Flour.

29:57.980 --> 30:01.450
How far below?
How close to the Red Keep were you?

30:03.030 --> 30:05.530
The shit that poured from their privy pipes

30:05.610 --> 30:09.340
flowed down the side of Aegon's Hill,

30:09.410 --> 30:13.260
along Tanner's Row
and right in front of my front door

30:13.330 --> 30:15.330
- on Gin Alley.
- Gin Alley.

30:18.130 --> 30:22.180
The Street of Steel,
with your armor and your knights?

30:22.260 --> 30:23.470
(SCOFFS)

30:23.550 --> 30:25.890
You lived in the fancy part of town.

30:29.930 --> 30:31.560
And here we are now.

30:32.810 --> 30:36.400
Two boys from Flea Bottom
in the castle of a king.

30:36.810 --> 30:38.910
Yeah, we've come a long way.

30:39.900 --> 30:42.070
We're all the same, really.

30:42.150 --> 30:45.160
She went to great pains
to point that out to me.

30:45.240 --> 30:47.830
If you mistrust fancy people so much,

30:47.950 --> 30:50.540
why were you in such a hurry to trust her?

30:52.040 --> 30:53.460
You're me.

30:54.500 --> 30:55.920
Never been with a woman.

30:56.000 --> 30:58.720
Never talked to a woman, really.

30:58.790 --> 31:00.260
And then she comes at you,

31:01.170 --> 31:03.420
big words, no clothes.

31:03.510 --> 31:05.600
What would you have done?

31:07.010 --> 31:11.140
She does know her way
around a man's head, I'll give her that.

31:11.220 --> 31:12.810
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

31:16.440 --> 31:18.560
So how'd you become a lord?

31:18.850 --> 31:20.650
Oh. That's a long story.

31:20.730 --> 31:23.580
Better not, then. I'm a bit busy.

31:27.110 --> 31:30.370
Many years ago I helped King
Stannis out of a difficult situation.

31:31.660 --> 31:33.210
He rewarded me with a lordship.

31:34.870 --> 31:36.370
And this.

31:38.870 --> 31:40.380
You see?

31:41.250 --> 31:42.840
Highborns.

31:46.840 --> 31:51.270
I didn't want to be a lord.
I nearly didn't accept.

31:51.350 --> 31:52.770
Why did you?

31:52.850 --> 31:54.640
I did it for my son.

31:55.890 --> 31:58.360
I didn't want him to step
over a river of shit

31:58.480 --> 32:00.900
every time he stepped
through his front door.

32:02.400 --> 32:04.990
I wanted him to have a better life.

32:06.820 --> 32:07.910
Does he?

32:09.450 --> 32:10.790
He's dead.

32:16.750 --> 32:17.870
How'd he die?

32:19.750 --> 32:21.420
Following me.

32:32.300 --> 32:35.180
When did you come to this strange country?

32:37.520 --> 32:38.940
When I was 13.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.770
You were only a child.

32:42.020 --> 32:44.490
I stopped being a child when I was nine.

32:45.150 --> 32:47.240
My mother made sure of that.

32:48.990 --> 32:52.960
You've been a good
influence on our mutual friend, you know.

32:53.120 --> 32:56.790
He used to drink from sundown to
sunup, visit three brothels a night,

32:56.870 --> 32:59.370
gamble away his father's money.

32:59.450 --> 33:01.300
Now it's just the drinking.

33:02.580 --> 33:04.710
And now I'm his wife's servant.

33:04.790 --> 33:08.220
I brush her hair and clip her
nails and empty her chamber pot.

33:08.300 --> 33:11.220
She is a sweet young thing.
None of this is her fault.

33:11.300 --> 33:13.640
I love that girl. I would kill for her.

33:13.800 --> 33:16.180
Do you think that makes it easier for me?

33:16.260 --> 33:18.520
No, I expect not.

33:21.100 --> 33:25.110
She's young
and she's beautiful and highborn.

33:25.190 --> 33:29.490
We break bread with them,
but that doesn't make us family.

33:29.570 --> 33:33.660
We've learned their language, but
we'll never be their countrymen.

33:35.320 --> 33:38.250
If you let yourself believe

33:38.330 --> 33:40.500
that a foreign girl with no name

33:40.580 --> 33:42.920
could spend her life with
the son of Tywin Lannister...

33:43.000 --> 33:44.340
I have a name.

33:44.460 --> 33:45.760
You have one name.

33:45.830 --> 33:50.260
As do I. Here, only the
family name matters.

33:50.340 --> 33:52.430
What do you want from me, Lord Varys?

33:56.220 --> 33:57.940
Diamonds.

33:58.010 --> 34:00.890
I'd tell you to beware
carrying so much wealth,

34:00.970 --> 34:03.520
but you know how to protect yourself.

34:04.310 --> 34:08.860
Get on one of those
ships. Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr.

34:09.440 --> 34:14.040
You can buy a house
with these diamonds, a very large house.

34:14.110 --> 34:15.909
Hire servants.

34:15.989 --> 34:19.870
Start a new life, a good
life, far from here.

34:20.409 --> 34:25.010
The mysterious foreign
beauty. You'll have suitors lining up.

34:25.460 --> 34:27.260
Why do you want me to leave?

34:27.330 --> 34:29.630
Tyrion Lannister is one
of the few people alive

34:29.750 --> 34:32.050
who could make this country a better place.

34:32.130 --> 34:35.230
He has the mind, the will,
and the right last name.

34:35.300 --> 34:36.600
And you.

34:37.429 --> 34:40.480
You are a complication.

34:41.929 --> 34:44.060
I know you love him.

34:44.429 --> 34:47.980
And I know it's
true love, not bought by gold and silver.

34:48.060 --> 34:50.440
I'm not asking you to leave him for money.

34:50.520 --> 34:53.150
I'm asking you to leave

34:53.239 --> 34:58.330
because your presence
in the capital endangers him.

34:59.410 --> 35:02.040
This will never be your home, my lady.

35:02.240 --> 35:06.040
Find a true home somewhere far from here,

35:07.420 --> 35:09.510
while there's still time.

35:10.670 --> 35:11.840
Lord Varys.

35:16.800 --> 35:20.270
If he wants me to leave,
he can tell me himself.

35:28.980 --> 35:30.530
Keep up.

35:31.270 --> 35:33.450
I don't think I can, my lord.

She doesn't deserve this.

36:09.270 --> 36:10.740
Deserve?

36:10.810 --> 36:12.690
Be careful with that.

36:13.820 --> 36:16.790
Start trying to work out who deserves what,

36:16.860 --> 36:19.740
and before long you'll spend your days

36:19.860 --> 36:22.740

Will you be facing your
marriage to Ser Loras

36:30.210 --> 36:32.930
with the same philosophical spirit?

36:33.000 --> 36:34.500
I won't be marrying Ser Loras.

36:34.590 --> 36:39.430
I seem to remember saying something
similar about my own marriage.

36:39.510 --> 36:41.060
You're not me.

36:42.890 --> 36:46.690
You want to make
things better for Sansa? Give her a child.

36:46.770 --> 36:51.020
So you can tell Father it was you
who finally talked me into it?

36:51.100 --> 36:53.980
So she can have some happiness in her life.

36:54.060 --> 36:55.740
You have children.

36:56.190 --> 36:58.820
How happy would you say you are?

37:01.950 --> 37:03.290
Not very.

37:06.370 --> 37:08.540
But if it weren't for my children,

37:08.620 --> 37:11.170
I'd have thrown myself
from the highest window in the Red Keep.

37:24.390 --> 37:29.310
He was all I had once.
Before Myrcella was born.

37:33.190 --> 37:36.410
I used to spend hours looking at him.

37:38.190 --> 37:40.160
His wisps of hair.

37:41.440 --> 37:43.950
His tiny little hands and feet.

37:45.120 --> 37:47.580
He was such a jolly little fellow.

37:50.660 --> 37:53.840

37:53.920 --> 37:56.630
"We should have known.
Even then we should have known."

37:56.710 --> 37:58.180
It's nonsense.

38:00.460 --> 38:03.090
Whenever he was with me, he was happy.

38:07.260 --> 38:10.690
And no one can take
that away from me, not even Joffrey,

38:10.770 --> 38:13.190
how it feels to have someone.

38:14.310 --> 38:16.110
Someone of your own.

Every time we
deal with an enemy, we create two more.

it will go on for quite a long time.

On the back of his dragon,
Balerion the Dread.

48:30.720 --> 48:33.890
He had a smaller fleet
than the kings he faced

48:34.010 --> 48:37.190
and a smaller army, but
he had three dragons.

48:37.270 --> 48:39.310
Dragons are magic, Ser Davos.

48:39.390 --> 48:42.740
My enemies have made my kingdom bleed.

48:44.520 --> 48:46.490
I will not forget that.

48:47.570 --> 48:49.700
I will not forgive that.

48:51.070 --> 48:54.950
I will punish them
with any arms at my disposal.

48:55.200 --> 48:57.880
You do not need to burn the boy.

48:58.750 --> 49:01.250
If what you say is true,

49:01.330 --> 49:04.210
a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark...

49:04.290 --> 49:07.010
And our King is
still no closer to the Iron Throne.

49:09.970 --> 49:13.220
A great gift requires a great sacrifice.

49:30.110 --> 49:34.210
His name is Gendry. He's a good lad.

49:35.120 --> 49:39.790
A poor lad from Flea Bottom, who
happens to be your nephew.

49:45.130 --> 49:48.550
What is the life
of one bastard boy against a kingdom?

49:50.630 --> 49:51.970
Everything.

49:53.340 --> 49:55.140
The boy must die.

50:02.810 --> 50:04.610
- What are you doing?
- You're leaving.

50:06.060 --> 50:07.820
Is this some kind of trick?

50:07.980 --> 50:09.780
Yes, but not on you.

50:14.320 --> 50:16.950
Aim for that star. Don't stop.

50:17.030 --> 50:19.500
There's bread and water. Go slow with it.

50:19.580 --> 50:23.920
If you finish it off,
no matter how thirsty you get,

50:24.670 --> 50:26.590
don't drink seawater.

50:26.670 --> 50:28.420
I know not to drink seawater.

50:28.500 --> 50:32.130
Row for a full day and night
and you'll reach Rook's Rest.

50:32.340 --> 50:34.890
You'll want to stop there.
Don't. She'll find you.

50:35.130 --> 50:36.480
Where should I go?

50:36.550 --> 50:37.900
You must keep the coast on your left side

50:38.010 --> 50:39.390
until you reach King's Landing.

50:39.470 --> 50:41.150
The gold cloaks are looking for me.

50:41.270 --> 50:42.940
They were looking for me for 20 years.

50:43.020 --> 50:44.770
- Do they know your face?
- No.

50:44.850 --> 50:47.360
I'd worry more about the Red Woman.

50:53.860 --> 50:55.360
The other way.

50:59.830 --> 51:01.620
You ever been in a boat before?

51:02.040 --> 51:03.160
No.

51:03.250 --> 51:04.540
You know how to swim?

51:04.620 --> 51:05.790
No.

51:05.870 --> 51:08.340
Don't fall out. Go on.

51:12.050 --> 51:13.470
Why are you doing this?

51:13.550 --> 51:14.970
Because it's right.

51:15.760 --> 51:17.510
And because I'm a slow learner.

51:20.600 --> 51:23.650
When you get to Flea Bottom,
have a bowl of brown for me.

51:28.900 --> 51:30.520

51:30.610 --> 51:33.030

51:54.920 --> 51:57.020
I don't think he can see us.

52:00.890 --> 52:01.930
Pyp?

52:05.600 --> 52:06.770
Sam?

52:06.850 --> 52:09.320
Hush, now. You're home.

52:11.440 --> 52:13.690
Carry him inside. Gently.

53:51.500 --> 53:53.170
You don't deny it?

53:54.290 --> 53:57.720
No. I let him go.

53:59.050 --> 54:01.670
Your mercy saved the boy's life.

54:02.170 --> 54:03.640
You feel good about that?

54:03.760 --> 54:05.230
Aye, I do.

54:05.800 --> 54:07.730
MELISANDRE: You saved one innocent.

54:07.970 --> 54:11.230
How many tens of thousands
have you doomed?

54:14.900 --> 54:16.990
There has got to be another way.

54:17.190 --> 54:20.280
(SHOUTING) What other way?
Tell us about this other way.

54:20.360 --> 54:22.030
DAVOS: I don't know, Your Grace.

54:22.570 --> 54:24.040
I can't see the future in the fire.

54:29.240 --> 54:31.040
Very well, Ser Davos Seaworth.

54:32.620 --> 54:34.840
I, Stannis of the House Baratheon,

54:34.920 --> 54:37.290
First of My Name, Rightful King
of the Andals and the First Men,

54:37.380 --> 54:38.420
sentence you to die.

54:38.590 --> 54:39.630
DAVOS: I understand.

54:39.710 --> 54:41.840
But since you haven't
yet unnamed me Hand of the King,

54:41.920 --> 54:44.430
it is my duty to advise you against it.

54:44.510 --> 54:45.600
You're gonna need me.

54:45.760 --> 54:46.850
Take him away.

54:48.600 --> 54:49.970
Why am I gonna need you?

54:54.480 --> 54:55.770
My King.

55:00.070 --> 55:04.160
DAVOS: It's from Maester Aemon of the Night's Watch.
Their Lord Commander is dead.

55:04.240 --> 55:06.580
Took a ranging party north
and never made it back.

55:06.780 --> 55:09.000
One lad did, though.

55:09.070 --> 55:13.800
What he saw beyond the Wall,
it's coming for all of us.

55:27.890 --> 55:29.230
When did you learn to read?

55:30.260 --> 55:32.390
Matthos taught me before he died,

55:32.510 --> 55:34.690
so I could be of better service to you.

55:41.270 --> 55:44.450
This War of Five Kings means nothing.

55:45.530 --> 55:48.500
The true war lies to the north, my King.

55:50.160 --> 55:52.410
Death marches on the Wall.

55:53.120 --> 55:55.000
Only you can stop him.

55:55.410 --> 55:57.410
You can't stop him alone.

55:57.500 --> 56:00.090
You need someone to
rebuild your army for you,

56:00.170 --> 56:02.470
someone to convince
this lord and that lord to fight for you,

56:02.540 --> 56:04.670
to bring sellswords and
pirates to your side.

56:04.960 --> 56:06.840
I've made my decision.

56:08.630 --> 56:14.610
He's right. You need him.
He has a part to play in the war to come.

56:32.870 --> 56:34.870
You're in His army now.

56:58.180 --> 57:02.310
They will come, Your Grace.
When they're ready.

57:02.400 --> 57:04.110
Perhaps they didn't want to be conquered.

57:04.650 --> 57:09.030
You didn't conquer them.
You liberated them.
