00:00.200 --> 00:01.900
Previously in brothers and sisters

00:01.900 --> 00:03.500
A billion people eat this food every day.

00:03.500 --> 00:04.500
Don't you think it would taste
a lot better

00:04.500 --> 00:05.700
Coming from your orchards?

00:05.700 --> 00:08.400
Of course,
but you're not gonna charm me into a deal.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.900
I'm having a big family dinner.

00:09.900 --> 00:11.100
Why don't you join us?

00:11.100 --> 00:12.100
That sounds great.

00:12.100 --> 00:13.800
Mom's really into
this guy isaac.

00:13.800 --> 00:15.600
But if she wants us to go over
to the house and have dinner,

00:15.600 --> 00:16.900
That's what we have to do.

00:16.900 --> 00:18.700
Tommy had an affair
with lena.

00:18.700 --> 00:19.700
I never liked that girl.

00:19.700 --> 00:21.000
If you're gonna blame anyone,
blame tommy.

00:21.000 --> 00:23.100
Your opinion doesn't count
because you slept with lena, too.

00:23.100 --> 00:24.300
I'm still sleeping with her.

00:24.300 --> 00:25.900
It's not just that you slept
with lena.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.100
Tommy?

00:27.100 --> 00:28.700
Did it, too.
I slept with someone.

00:28.700 --> 00:30.500
- You what?
- We went out in high school.

00:30.500 --> 00:31.600
It was a mistake

00:31.600 --> 00:33.500
Was she? Was lena a mistake?

00:33.500 --> 00:34.500
Yeah, she was.

00:34.500 --> 00:38.500
Scotty, jason is coming back.
He--He--He contacted me.

00:42.700 --> 00:43.600
Hey, mom.

00:44.500 --> 00:47.000
Good sweet god in heaven,
was that you?

00:47.000 --> 00:48.500
No, that would be
typhoid travis,

00:48.500 --> 00:51.300
Attempting to spread his plague
to the good people of iowa.

00:51.300 --> 00:52.700
Those good people
gave me this plague.

00:52.700 --> 00:53.700
So...

00:54.500 --> 00:55.700
is isaac sick, too?

00:55.700 --> 00:58.900
No, travis would be the only one
suffering at the moment, thank god.

00:58.900 --> 01:00.700
Don't drink so much!

01:00.700 --> 01:03.900
I don't.
I hardly drink at all.

01:04.500 --> 01:06.700
I thought maybe if he was sick,
that's why he hadn't called.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.400
And then who could blame him,
you know,

01:08.400 --> 01:09.900
After the dinner party
from hell.

01:09.900 --> 01:13.100
No, mom, he's just busy with
the california primary, that's all.

01:13.100 --> 01:15.700
You don't have to make excuses.
I can take rejection.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.200
Mom, i'm not making excuses.

01:18.200 --> 01:20.600
I-It turns out that
presidential campaigns

01:20.600 --> 01:23.100
Are kind of
time-Consuming, okay?

01:23.100 --> 01:24.000
You know what you should do?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.800
Go down to the office, and you
should ask him out for lunch.

01:26.800 --> 01:30.000
God, no. That is just
way too forward.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.600
Mom, you know what?

01:30.600 --> 01:33.200
The man watched our family
disintegrate over paella.

01:33.200 --> 01:35.400
I think you're past
the too-Forward stage.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.600
And whatever happened
with julia and tommy anyway?

01:37.600 --> 01:38.700
I don't know.

01:39.000 --> 01:41.400
I never talk to them anymore.
I don't even talk to justin,

01:41.400 --> 01:45.100
<i>Who i guess is
still sleeping with lena.</i>

01:45.100 --> 01:46.600
- What could she be thinking?
- I don't know.

01:46.600 --> 01:48.200
Maybe she's wishing
that kevin were straight

01:48.200 --> 01:51.600
So she could go for
the whole walker trifecta.

01:51.600 --> 01:54.100
- Kitty, that's disgusting.
- Oh, look at that, mom.

01:54.100 --> 01:55.400
We're here. Gotta go.

01:55.400 --> 01:56.500
No, we're not.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.600
Mom, do me a favor.
Call isaac.

02:00.600 --> 02:01.200
No.

02:01.200 --> 02:03.400
- Call isaac!
- No!

02:03.400 --> 02:04.500
Bye.

02:04.800 --> 02:07.600
I have so many questions
about that conversation.

02:15.700 --> 02:17.700
I have to get up early tomorro

02:18.300 --> 02:19.400
So?

02:19.400 --> 02:22.900
I thought that we said that we
were gonna take the night off.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.600
Look, i know. I just really don't
feel like being at home tonight.

02:28.600 --> 02:31.200
I mean, i can't handle
another closed-Door phone call

02:31.200 --> 02:35.000
Between kitty and my mom
or sarah or god knows--

02:35.000 --> 02:39.000
Oh, great. Your being here
is only gonna make it worse.

02:39.100 --> 02:40.800
I don't care, okay?

02:40.800 --> 02:43.500
I still have to go
to work, justin.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.000
Wait. Where are...

02:47.800 --> 02:50.700
work, that's right.
Well, uh, how's work?

02:51.100 --> 02:52.400
What's that supposed to mean?

02:52.400 --> 02:54.300
Nothing.
Isn't it a little awkward?

02:55.100 --> 02:57.300
Of course. It sucks.

02:57.700 --> 02:59.200
Then why don't you quit?

02:59.900 --> 03:01.100
Because unlike you,

03:01.100 --> 03:03.400
I don't live at
my parents' house rent-Free,

03:03.400 --> 03:05.900
And i don't have a bunch of money
in the bank either. All right?

03:05.900 --> 03:07.300
I need this paycheck.

03:07.300 --> 03:09.600
Do you actually think that
i like working for your brother?

03:09.600 --> 03:11.300
Okay, i'm sorry i brought
this up, all right?

03:11.300 --> 03:12.400
It's just--

03:13.100 --> 03:14.500
What are we doing?

03:14.800 --> 03:16.300
Everybody is pissed at us.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.800
Rebecca hasn't talked to me
since the wedding.

03:19.900 --> 03:22.500
You and tommy are
practically estranged.

03:22.500 --> 03:24.600
When you and i started
seeing each other, we said,

03:24.600 --> 03:26.900
You know,
we wanted to have fun.

03:26.900 --> 03:28.700
But now i don't know.
You're just--

03:28.700 --> 03:30.300
You're being really intense.

03:30.300 --> 03:32.500
- Intense?
- Yeah, and i'm worried.

03:32.500 --> 03:33.900
So what, you think
i'm using again?

03:33.900 --> 03:34.600
No.

03:34.600 --> 03:35.800
Look, 'cause i'm not,
all right?

03:35.800 --> 03:37.100
I'm going to my meetings,
and you know what?

03:37.100 --> 03:40.000
I-I even just found one
for vets, so...

03:40.000 --> 03:41.100
that's--That's great.

03:41.100 --> 03:43.600
What--What--
What's the problem here?

03:44.100 --> 03:45.900
You seem really angry lately.

03:45.900 --> 03:47.300
Not at you.

03:47.600 --> 03:49.600
Tommy's the one who screwed up,
okay? Not us.

03:49.600 --> 03:51.100
And i'm just sick
and tired of everyone

03:51.100 --> 03:53.200
Making us pay
for his mistakes.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.100
It think it's
more complicated than that.

03:56.100 --> 03:58.300
Like what--What, do you still
have feelings for him?

03:58.300 --> 04:00.500
No. No, of course not.

04:00.500 --> 04:02.600
Okay, so then what are
we worrying about?

04:02.600 --> 04:03.700
You know, tommy and julia,
they're gonna--

04:03.700 --> 04:04.900
They're gonna make it or not.

04:04.900 --> 04:06.600
But you know what?
That's their issue.

04:07.800 --> 04:10.500
No, you're... you're--You're
really--You're right.

04:12.300 --> 04:14.400
All right. Come here.

04:17.899 --> 04:19.600
Can i stay?

04:21.000 --> 04:22.400
Yeah.

04:24.000 --> 04:30.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

04:32.700 --> 04:34.800
- Is that new?
- Ish.

04:36.900 --> 04:38.800
Did you get it in phoenix?

04:40.100 --> 04:42.400
Actually, i got it
a couple weeks ago...

04:42.700 --> 04:43.900
for you.

04:48.100 --> 04:49.400
It's nice.

04:54.400 --> 04:57.000
You know, i was thinking
maybe tomorrow, um,

04:57.000 --> 04:59.200
I could drive up,
we could have lunch.

04:59.200 --> 05:00.400
If--If that's okay.

05:00.400 --> 05:02.900
Yeah, if you want to.

05:03.200 --> 05:04.900
I think it'll be good
for us to do things

05:04.900 --> 05:07.200
That we used to do before...

05:07.200 --> 05:08.600
you know, normal things.

05:10.300 --> 05:13.600
Yeah, there's this
new seafood restaurant. We...

05:13.600 --> 05:15.500
we could meet there
if you want to.

05:15.500 --> 05:17.900
Okay, yeah, good.
That sounds good.

05:26.600 --> 05:27.800
Sorry, sir, we're closed.

05:27.800 --> 05:29.000
I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.100
What took you so long?

05:30.100 --> 05:31.800
I don't just cook, kevin.

05:31.800 --> 05:32.900
I also clean.

05:32.900 --> 05:36.100
God, i would make such
a good husband, wouldn't i?

05:36.100 --> 05:38.700
Don't worry, i'm not fishing.
Oh, speaking of which,

05:38.700 --> 05:40.800
I was left alone on the line
to finish a grilled turbot

05:40.800 --> 05:43.200
When we ran out
of cider vinegar sauce.

05:43.200 --> 05:48.500
So i finished it with
cubed red peppers and cumin.

05:48.500 --> 05:49.400
And is that bad?

05:49.400 --> 05:50.500
Well, it wasn't
what they ordered.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.200
I me, i was sort of flying
by the seat of my pants.

05:52.200 --> 05:54.700
But the server came in
with compliments to the chef.

05:54.700 --> 05:56.700
<i>Wow. Bra, poissonier.</i>

05:56.700 --> 05:57.700
Merci.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.100
So...

06:00.500 --> 06:01.600
what's new with you?

06:01.900 --> 06:04.400
Just depositions
too boring to describe...

06:05.600 --> 06:07.300
and jason called.

06:08.900 --> 06:10.300
And jason called.

06:10.300 --> 06:12.100
Yeah, he's back in l.A.,

06:12.500 --> 06:14.900
And he wants to meet
for coffee...

06:16.100 --> 06:17.400
tomorrow.

06:18.500 --> 06:21.000
Look, if you're at all uncomfortable
with this, i can cancel.

06:21.000 --> 06:23.500
- It's absolutely no problem.
- No, no. It's fine.

06:23.500 --> 06:25.000
I mean, i knew he was gonna
call eventually.

06:25.000 --> 06:26.400
Yeah and, you know
he's robert's brother.

06:26.400 --> 06:27.800
It's not like i'm not
gonna run into him.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.800
Yeah, and you guys had??

06:29.800 --> 06:32.400
So yeah, i mean, go see him.

06:32.400 --> 06:33.600
Resolve whatever
you need to resolve.

06:33.600 --> 06:37.400
Look, i'm absolutely resolved.
Absolutely.

06:39.600 --> 06:41.900
So i-I-I told him
he could drop by.

06:41.900 --> 06:44.100
I hope
that's not a... problem.

06:44.100 --> 06:46.400
Scotty, if you have any issues
about this, please say,

06:46.400 --> 06:49.100
- 'Cause i can cancel.
- I said it was fine, kevin.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.900
- Okay.
- Thank you for asking,

06:53.000 --> 06:55.100
- But it's all good.
- Okay.

06:56.100 --> 06:57.600
Anyway, i am beat.

06:57.600 --> 07:00.200
Uh, let's go home.

Brothers & sisters s02 ep11

07:08.800 --> 07:11.200
I just don't understand
what's bothering you, sarah.

07:11.200 --> 07:13.400
This is a chance for us
to make a huge splh.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.800
Theoretically, but what graham's??

07:16.800 --> 07:19.300
But graham has had
a huge success in china before.

07:19.300 --> 07:21.200
He knows thearkets.
He has the contacts.

07:21.200 --> 07:23.600
He has no vested interest
in this company, saul.

07:23.600 --> 07:24.800
He's a gambler.

07:25.000 --> 07:26.400
Are you really willing to risk
everything that

07:26.400 --> 07:29.300
You, my father, tommy and
everybody else spent years building

07:29.300 --> 07:31.500
For something that has
no guarantees whatsoever?

07:31.500 --> 07:33.700
You and i both know that there
are no guarantees in life.

07:33.700 --> 07:35.400
True, but there's
degrees of risk.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.400
There's calculated,
sensible risk,

07:37.400 --> 07:39.700
And then there's graham finch.

07:41.400 --> 07:44.000
Why are you so invested
in doing it his way?

07:44.000 --> 07:47.600
I am invested in whatever
is good for ojai.

07:48.600 --> 07:51.700
Okay, what about if we
just split it in half?

07:51.700 --> 07:53.500
We open with a hundred stores.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.000
And what if we can't
meet the increase?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.100
What if there's a frost
or, god forbid, a labor dispute?

07:57.100 --> 07:59.000
What if we
overextend ourselves

07:59.000 --> 08:01.600
And end up losing
our existing contracts?

08:02.600 --> 08:05.100
Ten stores, saul,
in two or three key cities.

08:05.100 --> 08:06.400
We can handle that.

08:06.400 --> 08:10.200
We can control quality,
build reputation, create demand.

08:10.400 --> 08:11.700
That'sow dad did it.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.500
This is your stubborn streak
speaking, sarah.

08:14.500 --> 08:17.000
You're welcome to try
and whittle away mresistance.

08:17.000 --> 08:19.200
I'm sure graham finch will be.

08:19.200 --> 08:21.300
- Sarah walker.
- Oh, speak of the devil.

08:21.300 --> 08:22.900
How soon can you get packed?

08:22.900 --> 08:24.400
We've just got ourselves
a meeting with the chairman

08:24.400 --> 08:27.000
Of golden plum imports
this evening in san francisco.

08:27.000 --> 08:29.200
Whoa, wait. What, today,??

08:29.200 --> 08:32.000
The chairman needs to be on
a plane to beijing in the morning,

08:32.000 --> 08:34.600
And he agreed to meet with us
at the hotel before he leaves.

08:34.600 --> 08:36.299
We're nowhere near ready
to present.

08:36.299 --> 08:39.200
Sarah, simon lao is the man,

08:39.299 --> 08:41.299
And if we really want this,
we need to be there.

08:41.299 --> 08:42.299
I already booked the flights.

08:42.299 --> 08:44.300
Well, i'm st not
comfortable winging it.

08:44.300 --> 08:46.500
Graham's right. I think you
should take this meeting.

08:46.500 --> 08:49.300
Well, i'm sorry, i'm not
a wing-It type of girl.

08:49.300 --> 08:50.900
You know,??

08:50.900 --> 08:52.300
But he would only take
the meeting

08:52.300 --> 08:54.800
If i assured him that the president
of ojai would be there herself.

08:54.800 --> 08:56.100
Well, tell him you lied.

08:56.100 --> 09:00.400
Sarah, what is wro with
a wildly successful meeting

09:00.400 --> 09:02.500
Followed by a-A fun night out
in san francisco?

09:02.500 --> 09:03.400
Fun night out?

09:03.400 --> 09:05.100
Why wouldn't
we be on the last plane home?

09:05.100 --> 09:07.700
Because there's no telling how
long the meeting's gonna last.

09:08.300 --> 09:10.700
Come on, i already reserved
two rooms at the hotel.

09:11.400 --> 09:14.500
Tell you what--Fun night out
is completely optional.

09:14.500 --> 09:17.800
No, the fun night out,
that's off the table.

09:23.500 --> 09:25.700
Okay, we'll go on my terms.

09:25.900 --> 09:28.800
L.A.X., 2:30. Be prepared
to argue the entire flight.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.100
And be prepared
to lose that argument.

09:32.200 --> 09:34.900
That's--That's pretty much
all i do these days.

09:34.900 --> 09:38.400
So i guess video games
are my new drug.

09:38.600 --> 09:41.100
I mean, it's healthier
than smack, right?

09:42.500 --> 09:46.400
My girlfriend thinks it's weird
to try and blot out iraq

09:46.400 --> 09:48.700
By running around
shootin' things,

09:48.700 --> 09:50.200
But it seems to work.

09:57.100 --> 09:58.700
I'm sam, and i'm an addict.

09:58.700 --> 09:59.900
Hi, sam.

09:59.900 --> 10:02.900
Well, uh, it's not as exciting
asombie killing,

10:03.800 --> 10:06.700
But the thing that gets me
through is my wife pamela.

10:06.700 --> 10:07.900
She's great.

10:09.000 --> 10:12.000
But lately, she's been
doing that thing, you know?

10:13.100 --> 10:15.400
She wants to know
what it was like over there.

10:16.500 --> 10:18.300
I mean,
i want to tell her...

10:19.300 --> 10:20.300
someday.

10:20.300 --> 10:22.400
But at night, when i'm
laying there not sleeping,

10:22.900 --> 10:24.600
And she's trying
to help me out,

10:24.600 --> 10:27.500
The last thing i want to do
is talk about that stuff.

10:27.700 --> 10:30.400
<i>It's like, can we please
just have sex?</i>

10:30.900 --> 10:33.300
It was definitely easier
when i was high.

10:34.700 --> 10:36.600
I could just nod out.

10:36.800 --> 10:38.300
But i guess if i'd wanted
to take the easy route,

10:38.300 --> 10:39.900
I wouldn't have
become a marine.

10:41.200 --> 10:42.500
I wouldn't be coming here.

10:45.100 --> 10:46.000
That's all.

10:50.300 --> 10:53.000
Okay. Anybody else
feel like talking today?

10:56.000 --> 10:58.400
No? All right.

10:58.400 --> 11:00.900
See you guys, uh,
back here next time, okay?

11:06.300 --> 11:11.800
God grant me the serenity to
accept the things i cannot chae,

11:11.900 --> 11:14.500
The courage to change
the things i can,

11:14.800 --> 11:16.900
And the wisdom
to know the difference.

11:16.900 --> 11:18.300
Amen.

11:19.400 --> 11:21.700
See you next time.
See you.

11:22.000 --> 11:23.600
Hey, uh, justin?

11:24.900 --> 11:25.600
Hey.

11:25.600 --> 11:27.300
- So how you doing?
- Good.

11:27.300 --> 11:28.200
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.000
Uh, what'd you think
of our little group?

11:30.000 --> 11:31.900
I like it, yeah.

11:31.900 --> 11:33.800
Yeah, i was kind of hoping that,
uh, maybe one of these days

11:33.800 --> 11:35.400
You'd get up and talk.

11:37.600 --> 11:40.100
Yeah, uh, it--It's not
that i don't want to.

11:40.100 --> 11:42.000
No, no. Well,
whenever you're ready.

11:42.200 --> 11:44.300
Thank you.??

11:50.200 --> 11:51.700
I'm gonna head up to
santa barbara

11:51.700 --> 11:53.700
- And check out those presses.
- Great.

11:54.900 --> 11:56.400
You gonna be
all right here?

11:57.600 --> 11:59.700
Yeah. Why wouldn't i be?

12:04.400 --> 12:08.400
Look, it's over between me
and lena, okay? It's done.

12:08.400 --> 12:09.800
Okay, the affair is over,

12:09.800 --> 12:12.800
But the possibility
of a lawsuit is not.

12:12.800 --> 12:15.200
- It's not gonna come to that.
- I hope not.

12:15.400 --> 12:19.400
But while i am gone, just--
Just please go by the book.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.700
You'll leave the door open.

12:20.700 --> 12:23.200
You won't make any comments
about what she's wearing.

12:23.200 --> 12:25.200
Nothing suggestive.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.300
- I'll be careful.
- Good.

12:28.200 --> 12:29.800
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:29.800 --> 12:33.300
- Hope i'm not interrupting.
- No, not at all. I'm rushing out.

12:33.300 --> 12:34.500
- Okay.
- Enjoy your lunch.

12:34.500 --> 12:35.400
Okay.

12:35.800 --> 12:37.300
- Hey.
- Hey.

12:39.300 --> 12:42.200
I thought, uh, we were gonna
meet at the restaurant.

12:42.200 --> 12:44.200
I know. For the first time ever,
the freeway was empty,

12:44.200 --> 12:45.700
So i figured i'd pick you up...

12:47.800 --> 12:50.800
which apparently was
a really stupid thing to do.

12:51.000 --> 12:53.700
No, it's, uh...
it's good.

12:53.900 --> 12:55.000
Well, i can try to reach her,

12:55.000 --> 12:56.900
But she just left
for another meeting.

12:57.300 --> 13:00.000
No, okay, okay. Yeah, i'll--
I'll, uh, give her a call,

13:00.000 --> 13:01.400
And then i'll get
right back to you.

13:02.100 --> 13:03.200
Is there a problem?

13:03.200 --> 13:05.300
Well, holly had a meeting
with western trucking tomorrow,

13:05.300 --> 13:07.700
And now they want to do it
this afternoon and...

13:09.500 --> 13:10.800
you know what? Don't sweat it.

13:10.800 --> 13:12.700
- I'll figure something out.
- No, it's an important account.

13:12.700 --> 13:13.600
If holly can't do it,
i should--

13:13.600 --> 13:15.400
Tommy, why don't??

13:15.900 --> 13:17.000
Look,
if you're rushed for time,

13:17.000 --> 13:19.500
We can still have lunch together,
and you can cover the meeting.

13:19.500 --> 13:20.900
Are you--
You sure it's okay?

13:20.900 --> 13:22.300
Yeah, it's fine.

13:22.300 --> 13:24.100
Do you have
any delivery menus?

13:26.100 --> 13:27.300
Thanks.

13:28.100 --> 13:30.200
So what are you
in the mood for?

13:35.200 --> 13:36.200
Come in.

13:36.900 --> 13:37.900
Hi.

13:39.500 --> 13:40.400
Nora.

13:40.400 --> 13:42.000
I-I was just
in the neighrhood,

13:42.000 --> 13:44.800
Thought maybe you'd like
to grab some lunch.

13:44.800 --> 13:47.400
Oh, i'd--I'd love,
but, um,

13:47.400 --> 13:49.600
I have a strategy
session in three minutes

13:49.600 --> 13:51.000
- That i--
- Ah. Yeah, it's--

13:51.000 --> 13:52.400
No, wait, wait.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.000
I'm canceling my entire schedule
for this evening.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.600
Would you have dinner with me?

13:59.900 --> 14:02.900
This evening? Let me think.

14:03.700 --> 14:05.100
I guess i could...

14:05.600 --> 14:07.400
cancel a few things.

14:07.400 --> 14:08.500
Good.

14:08.900 --> 14:10.300
- 8:00?
- 8:00.

14:10.300 --> 14:12.900
- Well, you know where i live.
- Yes, i do.

14:15.000 --> 14:16.300
Let's see.

14:20.400 --> 14:21.500
How's that mandarin
coming along?

14:21.500 --> 14:23.100
- Oh, very good.
- Yeah?

14:23.100 --> 14:26.500
I can say hello. After that,
it's up to the translator.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.200
Did you know it was
the year of the golden pig?

14:29.200 --> 14:30.400
I--Actually, i did.

14:30.400 --> 14:33.000
It's a very auspicious time
for new things,

14:33.000 --> 14:35.100
New ventures,
new relationships.

14:36.000 --> 14:39.400
Actually, it's a very
auspicious time to have a baby.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.700
Well, there's different
kinds of babies, you know.

14:41.700 --> 14:43.900
There's big, strong
100-Store babies,

14:43.900 --> 14:46.300
Tiny, little, feeble
10-Store babies--

14:46.300 --> 14:47.700
- Give it a rest, graham.
- Sarah, seriously--

14:47.700 --> 14:50.200
Sarah. No, sarah,
you're making a big mistake.

14:50.400 --> 14:52.900
Simon lao can partner
with any company he likes.

14:52.900 --> 14:53.700
He respects strength.

14:53.700 --> 14:54.700
If he thinks that
we're playing it too safe,

14:54.700 --> 14:55.800
He's just gonna move on
to somebody else.

14:55.800 --> 14:56.900
And if we do it your way,

14:56.900 --> 14:58.600
We run the long-Term risk
of delivering them

14:58.600 --> 15:01.300
An inferior product,
which is fine for you,

15:01.300 --> 15:02.600
Because if they pull out,

15:02.600 --> 15:04.000
You'd just find another company
to gamble with.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.600
You know, there actually is some
skill involved with what i do.

15:06.600 --> 15:07.700
When are you gonna
start trusting me?

15:07.700 --> 15:11.300
Just drop the flirting,
??

15:11.300 --> 15:12.700
And then i'll think about it.

15:13.800 --> 15:14.900
Consider it closed.

15:14.900 --> 15:15.900
- 50 stores?
- No.

15:15.900 --> 15:17.200
- 12 kiosks?
- No.

15:18.700 --> 15:19.900
So, uh,

15:20.100 --> 15:21.100
How's the taco?

15:21.800 --> 15:23.300
It's okay. You know,

15:23.300 --> 15:25.800
This new mexican place just opened
right by my parents' house.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.600
They have thbestish tacos.

15:27.600 --> 15:29.000
Is that where he took you?

15:30.200 --> 15:31.300
What?

15:33.100 --> 15:35.900
No, he did not take me
for mexican food,

15:35.900 --> 15:37.800
And how can you even
bring him up

15:37.800 --> 15:39.400
When she's sitting
right outside the door?

15:39.400 --> 15:41.200
You're the one
who suggested eating here.

15:41.200 --> 15:42.900
I thought we were going
for normal,

15:42.900 --> 15:44.400
Which obviously isn't working,

15:44.400 --> 15:46.100
Probably because all i can
think about is,

15:46.100 --> 15:48.300
Did you do it on your desk,
on hers?

15:48.300 --> 15:50.600
Like i don't have questions??

15:50.600 --> 15:52.200
Was it really just once?
Was he good?

15:52.200 --> 15:54.000
At least you know what
you're going up against.

15:54.000 --> 15:56.200
- "Up against"?
- I didn't mean it like that.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.400
Western trucking's here.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.700
- Yeah, i'll be right there.
- I'll get out of your hair.

16:00.700 --> 16:03.100
- Julia, i'm sorry.
- See you at home.

16:24.500 --> 16:25.500
Hi.

16:27.000 --> 16:28.300
Hi, kev.

16:32.000 --> 16:32.800
The loft looks great.

16:32.800 --> 16:34.900
Yeah, yeah, i--
Yeah, i like...

16:34.900 --> 16:36.900
um, living here.

16:36.900 --> 16:38.200
You still have this, huh?

16:38.800 --> 16:39.900
Yeah.

16:44.800 --> 16:46.900
Oh, oh, the wedding. I forgot
to tell you about the wedding.

16:46.900 --> 16:49.200
It was a total freak show.
Kitty ran away from the altar.

16:49.200 --> 16:50.900
Yeah, i can't believe??

16:50.900 --> 16:52.800
Robert told me all about it.

16:53.500 --> 16:54.900
He must be excited youe back.

16:54.900 --> 16:58.400
Yeah. Yeah, he's already made me
promise to campaign for him.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.200
You're gonna campaign?

17:00.800 --> 17:02.100
Kev, don't.
He's--He's my brother.

17:02.100 --> 17:03.500
Well, yeah.
Kitty's my ster.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.900
You don't see me
drinkin' the kool-Aid.

17:04.900 --> 17:08.200
Didn't--Didn't we once agree??

17:09.700 --> 17:12.000
Yeah. Yeah, we did.
You're right.

17:13.099 --> 17:14.900
So, uh, how's work?

17:14.900 --> 17:16.000
Oh, it's, uh--

17:16.900 --> 17:17.900
Hi.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.800
- Hi. What--
- I got off work early.

17:20.800 --> 17:23.000
- Hi, i'm scotty.
- Of course. Good to meet you.

17:23.000 --> 17:24.500
Good to meet you, too.

17:24.800 --> 17:27.099
Uh, uh, you know what?
We're--We're, uh,

17:27.099 --> 17:28.500
Just in the middle
of coffee, so maybe--

17:28.500 --> 17:30.500
Oh, no, of course. Enjoy.

17:30.600 --> 17:32.400
I did bring home
some soft-Shell crabs, though.

17:32.400 --> 17:34.200
They're not lobsters, but...

17:34.900 --> 17:37.200
jason, why don't you
join us for dinner

17:37.200 --> 17:39.700
Or late lunch
or whatever it is?

17:39.900 --> 17:40.700
No, no, no. I insist.

17:40.700 --> 17:42.000
Kevin, tell him how well
i do soft-Shell crabs.

17:42.000 --> 17:43.300
You know what?
I don't think tonight's--

17:43.300 --> 17:44.400
I'd love to.

17:45.500 --> 17:46.800
Great.

17:46.800 --> 17:48.000
Well, i'll get started
in the kitchen

17:48.000 --> 17:49.600
And leave you two alone.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.700
Graham,
this is not appropriate.

18:00.700 --> 18:02.300
Oh, really? I-I thought
they were kind of nice.

18:02.300 --> 18:05.800
They are nice, but this is
a business relationship,

18:05.800 --> 18:07.600
And they're just
not appropriate.

18:07.600 --> 18:08.700
- Yeah, i know.
- And this card--

18:08.700 --> 18:10.600
"Good luck
with your presentation"?

18:10.600 --> 18:11.900
This is our presentation.

18:11.900 --> 18:14.500
If i don't feel that
we're together on this 100%,

18:14.500 --> 18:16.500
We should just get on a plane
and go back to los angeles.

18:16.500 --> 18:19.000
Sarah, we are together in this.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.300
Good.
Where do you want these?

18:22.200 --> 18:24.000
Guess i'll just put 'em
next to ne.

18:24.800 --> 18:27.800
I'll tell the hotel you don't
approve of their gift.

18:28.400 --> 18:29.200
The hotel?

18:29.200 --> 18:31.200
Yes, they really appreciate
your business--

18:31.200 --> 18:32.400
<i>Well, our business.</i>

18:32.400 --> 18:34.200
And you know that chocolate
on your pillow?

18:34.400 --> 18:35.800
It's not from me either.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.100
- This is... awkward.
- Not for me.

18:42.400 --> 18:45.300
Uh, i'm gonna go get changed
for the meeting.

18:46.200 --> 18:49.400
Don't think you're gonna get more
stes just because i'm embarrassed.

18:51.600 --> 18:53.700
What about
something like this one?

18:53.700 --> 18:57.700
Oh, good god in heaven,
these can't possibly be mine.

18:58.200 --> 19:00.800
How much weight can you lose
in an hour and a half?

19:01.700 --> 19:04.400
Becca, i have to tell you,

19:04.400 --> 19:07.800
I found out about tommy
and your friend lena.

19:07.800 --> 19:10.900
- Oh, i'm so sorry, nora.
- Here, help me.

19:11.800 --> 19:15.500
It came out at the last family
dinner. Of course. Where else?

19:15.900 --> 19:19.300
Obviously, julia and tommy
have a whole lot to work on,

19:19.300 --> 19:24.400
But it really bothers me
that she's still dating justin.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.300
What kind of girl is she?

19:26.300 --> 19:28.400
Wait.
Uh, they're still dating?

19:30.100 --> 19:31.400
I thought you knew.

19:31.400 --> 19:33.600
No. No, i-I had no idea.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.400
I-I haven't spoken to either
of them since kitty's wedding.

19:36.700 --> 19:38.200
You haven't spoken to him
since the wedding?

19:38.200 --> 19:40.000
No. No, he hasn't called.

19:40.300 --> 19:41.900
Well, that's what
i'm talking about.

19:41.900 --> 19:44.800
He's just spending
every waking hour with her.

19:44.800 --> 19:47.200
You know, i-I just wish
i never got her that job.

19:47.500 --> 19:51.500
Sweetheart, don't blame yourself.
It's not your fault.

19:52.600 --> 19:54.000
Oh, that's nice.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.400
I want something...

19:58.300 --> 20:01.600
quiet and elegant
and sophisticated,

20:01.600 --> 20:03.100
Like he is.

20:03.300 --> 20:05.700
Wow.
You really like this guy.

20:12.300 --> 20:13.300
Hey.

20:13.400 --> 20:15.200
Hey. What are you doing here?

20:15.400 --> 20:17.600
I was just, um,
upstairs helping your mom

20:17.600 --> 20:19.700
Get ready for her date with isaac.

20:20.000 --> 20:21.000
Cool.

20:21.000 --> 20:22.400
Yeah.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.500
And?

20:24.600 --> 20:25.800
Juin, why didn't you
just tell me

20:25.800 --> 20:27.200
That you're still dating lena?

20:27.200 --> 20:28.900
Sorry i forgot
to send out the memo.

20:29.000 --> 20:30.600
No, i just don't understand,
because, like,

20:30.800 --> 20:33.000
Don't you care that
she slept with tommy? I mean--

20:33.000 --> 20:34.200
It was a mistake, okay?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.700
Really? Because usually when people
do something over and over again,

20:36.700 --> 20:37.500
That's not really a mistake.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.100
That's--That's more
of a hobby or--

20:39.100 --> 20:40.900
Or--Or what?
An addiction, right?

20:41.100 --> 20:43.100
I didn't say that but, you know,
now that you mention it,

20:43.100 --> 20:44.400
There are some glaring
similarities.

20:44.400 --> 20:45.700
- Look, this is ridiculous.
- Is it?

20:45.700 --> 20:47.400
Because it seems
pretty self-Destructive,

20:47.400 --> 20:48.400
What you're doing.
I me, you're ...

20:48.500 --> 20:50.800
you're tearing your family apart.
Like, why is it a secret?

20:50.800 --> 20:51.600
Why won't you just
tell everyone?

20:51.600 --> 20:53.500
I don't need this. If you have
a problem with me dating lena,

20:53.500 --> 20:55.400
That's exactly what it is.
It's your problem, okay?

20:55.400 --> 20:56.600
I don't have a problem.

20:56.700 --> 20:58.300
The bottom line is
you're hurting people, justin,

20:58.300 --> 20:59.900
And you're gonna get hurt.

21:06.900 --> 21:09.300
Uh, i'm feeling
a little entourage-Deficient.

21:09.500 --> 21:12.000
I'll try not to take
that comment personally.

21:17.700 --> 21:21.700
??? Mr. Liao, nice to meet you

21:24.900 --> 21:27.000
???

21:27.100 --> 21:29.700
??? Your fellow

21:29.800 --> 21:32.500
???

21:35.800 --> 21:37.800
Which one's
the translator?

21:39.900 --> 21:47.900
???

21:52.200 --> 21:53.800
You're the translator?

21:54.200 --> 21:55.400
You're at my mercy,
aren't you?

21:55.400 --> 21:57.900
Ten stores. Ten stores.

22:00.300 --> 22:03.300
Hey, i just wanted to check in.
Today was pretty awkward.

22:03.400 --> 22:05.400
I just want to make sure
everything's okay.

22:05.800 --> 22:08.300
Everything's fine. Thanks.

22:10.200 --> 22:11.800
Look, uh,

22:11.800 --> 22:15.400
I know that it isn't easy
with me being here.

22:15.600 --> 22:18.200
And julia didn't seem happy.

22:18.600 --> 22:21.200
No. No, she's not.

22:22.300 --> 22:23.500
Well, i'm sorry.

22:23.600 --> 22:26.100
Don't be.
It's not your problem.

22:26.600 --> 22:29.500
But... justin is.

22:30.700 --> 22:32.500
Is that your way
of asking me about him?

22:32.500 --> 22:33.800
Yeah.

22:34.400 --> 22:37.600
I just--I don't...
i don't know where it's going.

22:37.900 --> 22:39.400
Join the club.

22:39.400 --> 22:43.500
I mean, i have no idea where
julia and i are going either.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.100
You know,
it's actually easier

22:49.100 --> 22:51.600
To talk to you
than her right now.

22:53.600 --> 22:56.200
Yeah, well, it's always
been easy with us.

22:57.300 --> 22:58.500
Yeah.

22:59.600 --> 23:01.900
Whoa. Whoa. Uh,
what--What are you doing?

23:02.800 --> 23:05.000
No, wait. I-I just--
I thought you said--

23:05.000 --> 23:06.600
I don't know what i said,

23:06.700 --> 23:09.300
But i-I-I love julia.

23:09.700 --> 23:11.100
I'm sorry.

23:11.500 --> 23:13.200
No, it's, uh...

23:18.400 --> 23:20.400
so ???

23:20.500 --> 23:22.300
Is robert gonna
take california?

23:22.300 --> 23:24.100
Well, he has
the home state advantage.

23:24.100 --> 23:27.500
And now with this gulf scandal
behind him, his numbers are up.

23:27.600 --> 23:28.900
You really think
he's gonna win.

23:29.000 --> 23:31.600
Well, i never call a race
before it's over.

23:33.600 --> 23:36.100
Mmm. Good, thank you.

23:36.700 --> 23:38.600
You tell me what
you think about this.

23:39.300 --> 23:43.000
It's south african
and surprising.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.900
I don't ch like surprises.

23:44.900 --> 23:47.300
Well, i think you'll like this one.

23:52.100 --> 23:53.200
Wow.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.400
That's wonderful.

23:57.300 --> 23:59.100
Have you ever been
to south africa?

23:59.600 --> 24:00.800
No, have you?

24:00.800 --> 24:05.000
Oh, about five years ago,
before my wife claire got sick,

24:05.100 --> 24:06.600
I took the whole family.

24:06.700 --> 24:09.600
Well, i went to west africa
to explore my ancestry.

24:09.800 --> 24:13.100
We went to mali
and to car senegal

24:13.100 --> 24:14.600
And the gambia.

24:14.700 --> 24:16.300
It was quite a trip.

24:16.500 --> 24:18.100
Really?

24:18.300 --> 24:21.900
If i were to explore my ancestry,
i don't know where i'd go.

24:22.600 --> 24:24.100
I don't know
where i come from.

24:24.200 --> 24:26.000
I'm a little of this
and a little of that.

24:26.000 --> 24:27.100
I'm...

24:27.600 --> 24:29.200
i'm a mutt.

24:30.300 --> 24:34.800
Well, i'd say you're a very
well-Put-Together mutt.

24:39.000 --> 24:40.900
So what, you just wanted
company on the plane?

24:41.000 --> 24:44.200
Trust me, your being here is
crucial to us getting this deal.

24:44.200 --> 24:45.300
How? All i did was nod.

24:45.300 --> 24:46.600
I would ve liked
the chance to present.

24:46.600 --> 24:49.200
Well, you didn't see mr. Lao
talking, did you? Huh?

24:49.200 --> 24:50.300
It makes you seem
more powerful if you

24:50.300 --> 24:51.700
Let your minions speak for you.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.300
I didn't even know
what you said.

24:53.300 --> 24:55.900
- Ah.
- If i hear anything about
a hundred stores, i swear--

24:55.900 --> 24:57.600
Sarah, trust me.

25:01.500 --> 25:02.700
- Miss walker.
- Mm.

25:02.700 --> 25:05.100
We are very impressed
with your proposal.

25:05.200 --> 25:06.000
Thank you.

25:06.000 --> 25:09.700
We would like ojai, california,
produce on the shelves

25:09.800 --> 25:11.900
???

25:13.700 --> 25:15.700
In how many stores?

25:16.500 --> 25:19.600
Well, mr. Finch makes
a very strong case.

25:19.700 --> 25:23.400
We would like to start
with our ten flagship stores.

25:24.100 --> 25:25.700
Thank you, mr. Lao.

25:25.700 --> 25:27.200
That is very good news.

25:27.300 --> 25:28.700
Ah, please forgive me,

25:28.800 --> 25:30.600
- But i have an early
flight tomorrow.
- Of course.

25:30.700 --> 25:32.600
I look forward
to doing business,

25:32.600 --> 25:34.500
And i wish you
and your family

25:34.600 --> 25:36.300
Every success
in the coming year.

25:36.400 --> 25:37.800
Bye

25:37.900 --> 25:39.400
Thank you very much.

25:40.400 --> 25:41.700
My family?

25:41.700 --> 25:43.300
Well, i may have
accidentally let slip

25:43.400 --> 25:45.400
That your brother-In-Law is
about to become president.

25:45.500 --> 25:46.300
You didn't!

25:46.300 --> 25:48.600
Tell me off later
over a drink, okay?

25:49.400 --> 25:52.700
So, jason, wre exactly
were you in malaysia?

25:52.700 --> 25:54.800
Were you--Were you
in the middle of the jungle?

25:55.000 --> 25:57.100
Well, i was just outside
of kota kinabalu.

25:57.100 --> 25:59.300
- Kota... kin...
- Kinabalu.

26:00.300 --> 26:02.000
Yeah, it was--
It was very jungly.

26:02.100 --> 26:04.000
Wow.

26:04.100 --> 26:06.400
Must have been hard being
so far away from your home.

26:06.400 --> 26:07.600
It was isolating, yeah.

26:07.600 --> 26:08.700
I thought you were
so engrossed in your work,

26:08.700 --> 26:10.300
You wouldn't have time
for thoughts like that.

26:10.400 --> 26:11.700
I was hoping
it would be that way,

26:11.700 --> 26:15.500
But, uh, you know, the truth is,
i just wanted to come home.

26:15.700 --> 26:17.900
I felt like that every single
time i went to summer camp.

26:17.900 --> 26:19.800
I think i called home
twice a day.

26:19.800 --> 26:21.400
Calling home wasn't
really aoption for me.

26:21.400 --> 26:23.000
Why not?
No cell phone coverage?

26:23.300 --> 26:25.000
I was having a crisis
of faith, actually.

26:25.100 --> 26:28.000
Really? I didn't know that. Oh,
but then, you didn't tell me.

26:28.000 --> 26:30.300
I'm--I'm sorry. I was spending
my time talking to god.

26:30.300 --> 26:31.500
At least you were
talkin' to someone.

26:31.600 --> 26:34.300
And you don't need a cell phone
to talk to god, right?

26:37.000 --> 26:39.800
I'm gonna go to the kitchen.
Can i get anybody anything?

26:39.800 --> 26:42.200
Why don't you just drop
the hostess act?

26:42.600 --> 26:43.900
Okay.

26:45.000 --> 26:46.900
You guys had things
to resolve. It's obvious.

26:46.900 --> 26:48.300
So why bring home
crustaceans?

26:48.300 --> 26:50.300
I-I'd love to know what
you think we have to resolve.

26:50.300 --> 26:51.400
I have nothing to resolve.

26:51.400 --> 26:52.200
He keeps saying that.

26:52.200 --> 26:53.800
No, no, it's quite sple, honestly--

26:53.900 --> 26:55.000
We were together,
he went to malaysia,

26:55.000 --> 26:57.100
I never heard from him
again, end of story.

26:57.200 --> 26:59.000
Oh, really? Okay, what about
the part where you promised

26:59.000 --> 27:01.200
To wait for me and then
broke up with me on the phone?

27:01.300 --> 27:02.700
I'm surprised
you picked up the phone.

27:02.700 --> 27:04.200
- You want to know
why i didn't call?
- Why?

27:04.200 --> 27:05.800
I thought it would
make it worse.

27:05.900 --> 27:08.300
- Worse?
- I missed you too much, okay?

27:08.300 --> 27:10.100
I-I thought if i could
just focus on where i was

27:10.100 --> 27:11.400
- And what i was trying to do--
- You know-- You know what that is?

27:11.500 --> 27:13.900
That's the worst excuse
i've ever heard.

27:14.300 --> 27:16.200
You made me feel like
we were through, over,

27:16.200 --> 27:18.900
Like ias some materialistic
guy you had no time for.

27:19.000 --> 27:20.600
And you guys have nothing
to resolve. Right.

27:20.600 --> 27:21.700
Stay out of this
for one minute.

27:21.700 --> 27:24.000
No. Why don't you just
ask him why he came home?

27:24.000 --> 27:24.800
I'm sure you want to know.

27:24.800 --> 27:26.200
Well, it wasn't for him,
if that's what you're thinking.

27:26.300 --> 27:29.100
He dumped me. That's when
i found my spiritual strength--

27:29.300 --> 27:31.400
- Finally.
- So god won after all.

27:31.400 --> 27:34.900
Yes, kevin. In a contest
between you and god, god won.

27:34.900 --> 27:36.500
Great. So everything
worked out for the best.

27:36.500 --> 27:38.800
Yeah, perfect.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.200
Well, i'm really gla
we had that talk.

27:46.500 --> 27:47.800
Hey.

27:48.000 --> 27:49.300
Hi.

27:52.300 --> 27:53.900
What is this stuff?

27:55.100 --> 27:56.800
You said you had
some questions about him,

27:56.800 --> 27:58.400
So i thought i'd answer them.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.300
That's his yearbook picture...

28:00.600 --> 28:03.200
pictures from prom, letters
from high school, everything.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.700
And what about you and lena?
When did you sleep with her?

28:05.700 --> 28:07.100
I told you.

28:07.400 --> 28:09.500
It was a couple weeks
after you left, and, uh,

28:09.800 --> 28:13.000
You accused me of being
responsible for william's death.

28:13.200 --> 28:14.600
You remember that?

28:14.900 --> 28:17.200
So while you were off
dealing with your emotions,

28:17.200 --> 28:19.500
How did--How did you just
hook up with your ex-Boyfriend?

28:19.500 --> 28:21.900
I was dealing
with my emotions.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.300
I was also bored and lonely,
and i ran into someone i knew,

28:25.400 --> 28:28.300
And we had a couple drinks,
and--And i got hammered!

28:28.300 --> 28:29.700
What about you and lena?
Were you drunk?

28:29.700 --> 28:30.900
Yeah, the first time.

28:30.900 --> 28:33.700
The first time? So were
you sober the second, third--

28:33.700 --> 28:35.700
You went away, all right?
Gone! Nothing!

28:35.700 --> 28:37.200
You think that gives you
a right to cheat?

28:37.200 --> 28:39.100
Well, what's your excuse?

28:42.200 --> 28:43.000
I'll get her.

28:43.000 --> 28:44.900
No, tommy.

28:45.700 --> 28:47.600
We've got to
figure this out...

28:47.600 --> 28:48.900
for her.

28:49.100 --> 28:50.500
I know.

28:58.500 --> 28:59.800
Lena?

29:00.200 --> 29:02.000
I know i owe you
two weeks notice

29:02.000 --> 29:04.400
And that i'm not being
professional or whatever,

29:04.400 --> 29:07.200
But i just--
I can't be here anymore.

29:08.500 --> 29:10.400
Did something happen?

29:10.600 --> 29:12.300
Listen, i'm not gonna sue
or anything,

29:12.300 --> 29:14.700
If that's what
you're worried about.

29:16.100 --> 29:19.300
What made you decide
to do this now?

29:22.100 --> 29:24.700
I thought i was
in love with tommy...

29:26.400 --> 29:28.200
but clearly...

29:31.600 --> 29:33.200
i'm screwed up.

29:35.000 --> 29:37.800
When i was with william,

29:38.000 --> 29:39.400
I thought, this isn't perfect,

29:39.400 --> 29:41.900
It's a compromise,
but it's my choice.

29:42.100 --> 29:44.400
I even thought
that i was in control.

29:44.700 --> 29:46.300
And for 20 years,

29:46.300 --> 29:50.200
I let that idea and that man
dictate who i was.

29:51.100 --> 29:54.500
When i finally realized that
i was just filling in the gap

29:54.500 --> 29:57.800
For somebody else's
relationship, it was too late,

29:58.000 --> 29:59.800
And i couldn't leave.

30:00.900 --> 30:04.200
It is better if you
figure this out now.

30:10.000 --> 30:11.600
I hope so.

30:14.500 --> 30:16.000
Lena.

30:17.200 --> 30:21.600
Use this opportunity to find
something that's yours.

30:28.900 --> 30:32.900
Okay, make it for 10:00,
and then change the 2:00.

30:33.600 --> 30:35.500
All right. Okay.

30:35.700 --> 30:36.500
I'm--I'm sorry.

30:36.500 --> 30:37.900
That's okay.

30:39.100 --> 30:40.700
How are you, nora?

30:41.400 --> 30:44.800
Um... well, i've hardly seen
justin all week,

30:44.800 --> 30:46.400
But you'll be very happy
to hear that

30:46.400 --> 30:48.300
Tommy and julia have said
that they really, truly have--

30:48.300 --> 30:49.700
Nora?

30:50.700 --> 30:53.400
I asked, how are you?

30:53.400 --> 30:55.100
Not your kids.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.200
Oh.

30:59.300 --> 31:02.200
How i am i

31:04.400 --> 31:06.100
I have no idea.

31:12.500 --> 31:14.200
Uh, travis?

31:15.200 --> 31:17.500
I'm not gonna deal
with that right now,

31:17.800 --> 31:19.800
Don't call back.

31:20.000 --> 31:23.300
I'm dealing with something
extremely important.

31:23.600 --> 31:25.400
You understand?

31:30.300 --> 31:31.900
I'm sorry.

31:32.400 --> 31:34.200
That's okay.

31:37.700 --> 31:42.100
You're right.
This wine is surprising...

31:43.300 --> 31:46.500
a very nice surprise.

31:49.100 --> 31:50.800
???For my brother-In-Law--

31:50.800 --> 31:53.500
He's ertainly t best-Lookg
candidate we've ever had.

31:53.500 --> 31:55.500
Yeah, not to mention he'd make
a damn fine president.

31:55.500 --> 31:58.500
To senator mccallister and his
unwitting assist in today's victory.

31:58.600 --> 32:00.900
I suppose if my sister
has to marry a republican,

32:00.900 --> 32:02.400
I should benefit
in some fashion.

32:02.400 --> 32:05.200
Well, you know, you're just
gonna end up being so rich that,

32:05.200 --> 32:07.200
Uh, you're probably gonna have
to become a republican yourself.

32:07.200 --> 32:08.800
That's a depressing thought.

32:08.900 --> 32:10.300
Okay, so what happens

32:10.300 --> 32:12.500
If robert doesn't make it
to the white house?

32:12.500 --> 32:14.600
Well, that connectn
just got us in the door.

32:14.800 --> 32:17.900
By election day, they're
gonna be so impressed

32:17.900 --> 32:21.800
By ojai foods and by you,
it's... it's not gonna matter.

32:22.000 --> 32:24.100
- Well, i hope you're right.
- Oh, yeah.

32:24.200 --> 32:28.400
- To golden plum.
- And its ten flagship stores.

32:29.600 --> 32:32.300
So now you don't want
mccallister to win? Why is that?

32:32.600 --> 32:34.200
Wrong party,

32:34.300 --> 32:36.600
Though i suppose it'd
be fun you need a date?

32:36.600 --> 32:40.600
???I've got a tux and everything.

32:40.900 --> 32:42.400
I'm weighing my options.

32:42.400 --> 32:43.800
Huh.

32:46.200 --> 32:47.700
Oh, damnoh, ow,

32:47.700 --> 32:50.400
I'm afraid you're gonna have to
go on option-Weighing because,

32:50.600 --> 32:51.500
Uh, i got a late dinner.

32:51.500 --> 32:54.700
What happened to our fun night
out in san francisco?

32:55.300 --> 32:56.500
Uh...

32:56.700 --> 32:59.700
i'm--I'm sorry,
but i-I really thought

32:59.700 --> 33:02.500
Our night out
was off the table.

33:03.000 --> 33:05.600
It--It was.
I'm just kidding.

33:07.500 --> 33:08.800
Graham?

33:09.900 --> 33:11.500
- Hi.
- Hey.

33:11.600 --> 33:14.500
Sorry. I was, um,
waiting in the lobby.

33:14.600 --> 33:18.100
Oh, not at all. Uh, yvonne calo,
this is sarah walker.

33:18.100 --> 33:20.100
- Hi.
- ???M actually doing, uh, work
for her company at the moment.

33:20.200 --> 33:22.200
Be careful of this one.
He'll make you a ton of money,

33:22.200 --> 33:23.700
And then you'll never
want to wat tm go.

33:23.700 --> 33:24.900
That's right.

33:25.200 --> 33:27.200
I'll try to remember that.

33:28.600 --> 33:29.300
Come on.

33:29.300 --> 33:31.500
Oh, and, uh, just to remind you
that tomorrow morning

33:31.500 --> 33:33.100
The car's coming
really early--7:30.

33:33.100 --> 33:35.500
Okay. Nice to meet you,
yvonne.

33:35.500 --> 33:36.900
You too

33:39.100 --> 33:40.600
Yvonne.

33:42.000 --> 33:43.300
Figures.

33:48.600 --> 33:50.100
Okay, if you're not gonna talk
about what happened tonight,

33:50.100 --> 33:51.000
I'm gonna go out.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.600
Nothing to talk about.
You ambushed my tea party.

33:53.600 --> 33:54.600
I got out of work early.

33:54.600 --> 33:56.300
No, no, no. You made sure
you got out of work early.

33:56.300 --> 33:58.500
Okay, fine. Well, actually,
now i know what's going on.

33:58.500 --> 34:00.000
Well, i'm glad you d
because i don't.

34:00.000 --> 34:02.000
Exactly. You don't know.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.100
You don't know how you feel
about br, about him, about anything.

34:05.100 --> 34:07.200
If you did, you might have
to choose, really choose,

34:07.200 --> 34:09.800
Instead of...
instead of pretending.

34:09.900 --> 34:11.100
Is that what we're doing,
pretending?

34:11.100 --> 34:12.500
You tell me.

34:13.100 --> 34:15.199
Because i don't feel
like i live here.

34:15.199 --> 34:17.900
- I stay here
because you let me.
- Ohh.

34:18.000 --> 34:20.600
Do you realize there's
nothing in this apartment

34:20.600 --> 34:21.800
That's mine except clothes?

34:21.800 --> 34:23.000
What do you want me
to do, scotty?

34:23.000 --> 34:24.300
Be honest with me.

34:25.699 --> 34:27.199
If you're still in love
with jason mccallister--

34:27.199 --> 34:30.199
No, i am not in love
with jason mccallister.

34:30.300 --> 34:31.600
Why do you have
to be so jealous?

34:31.600 --> 34:33.100
Because if you could see
the two of you together--

34:33.100 --> 34:35.100
If you don't trust me, leave.

34:35.300 --> 34:36.100
Fine.

34:36.100 --> 34:37.300
Oh, god. Where are you?

34:37.300 --> 34:39.699
I'm leaving.
Isn't that what you want?

34:39.699 --> 34:41.600
Yeah, it is.
Have a great night.

34:48.699 --> 34:49.699
Hey.

34:50.500 --> 34:51.500
Hey.

34:52.600 --> 34:54.400
Where's, uh, where's mom?

34:54.600 --> 34:56.900
Uh, i don't know.
Think she's out with isaac.

34:58.200 --> 34:59.700
Mind if i join you?

35:00.600 --> 35:02.300
Yeah, whatever.

35:08.300 --> 35:12.300
Listen, i... i know
it hasn't been easy between us,

35:12.300 --> 35:14.700
And we haven't exactly been
honest with each other,

35:14.700 --> 35:16.800
And you're probably
gonna want to kill me.

35:17.400 --> 35:18.900
But, um...

35:19.900 --> 35:22.400
lena tried to kiss me.

35:24.100 --> 35:25.700
I know.

35:26.200 --> 35:27.300
You do?

35:27.300 --> 35:28.600
Yeah, she told me
the wholthy.

35:28.800 --> 35:30.100
Look, i didn't do anything. I--

35:30.100 --> 35:33.600
I know. She said
it was her fault, you know.

35:35.400 --> 35:37.500
It's fine.
We broke up anyway.

35:38.400 --> 35:40.500
??? Are you ok?

35:41.300 --> 35:42.600
Not really, but ...

35:42.700 --> 35:44.700
i guess it's probably
what's best for me.

35:46.000 --> 35:47.400
Turns out if you want
to escape reality,

35:47.400 --> 35:49.500
Sex is almost
as good as pills.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.200
Tell me about it.

35:53.000 --> 35:54.600
I'm sorry, man.

35:55.400 --> 35:56.700
Me, too.

36:00.000 --> 36:01.700
You know,
sometimes it really sucks

36:01.800 --> 36:03.900
We can't have
a beer together.

36:04.500 --> 36:06.900
Well, we can.
You just have to drink it.

36:29.500 --> 36:32.400
Go away. I'm busy.

36:32.500 --> 36:33.900
Would you please
open the door?

36:33.900 --> 36:34.700
No.

36:34.700 --> 36:36.800
Scotty, open the door.

36:50.200 --> 36:52.100
Wow, i love what you've
done with the place.

36:52.200 --> 36:55.100
Yeah, well,
at least it's mine.

36:56.600 --> 36:57.200
I'm sorry.

36:57.200 --> 37:01.500
No, i... shouldn't have
barged in on your tea party.

37:01.600 --> 37:03.700
Yeah, enough with
the shellfish now.

37:05.700 --> 37:08.700
But you know what? When you
walked in, i was secretly so proud.

37:09.300 --> 37:10.600
Of what?

37:10.700 --> 37:12.000
Of you,

37:12.400 --> 37:16.400
Of how genuine you are
and how crazy and honest and--

37:16.600 --> 37:18.100
Jealous.

37:18.300 --> 37:19.600
Mm...

37:22.400 --> 37:24.200
so how do i make this better?

37:25.000 --> 37:27.000
I don't want you
to see him anymore.

37:30.500 --> 37:33.100
???

37:33.100 --> 37:35.300
I know you're gonna
run into him at family stuff.

37:35.300 --> 37:36.500
Yeah.

37:37.200 --> 37:39.800
I just don't want you
making plans with him.

37:40.000 --> 37:41.400
Okay.

37:41.700 --> 37:43.300
Promise.

37:44.400 --> 37:45.500
Really?

37:45.600 --> 37:49.200
I don't think you get how much
i want us to be together.

37:50.900 --> 37:53.400
God, now i feel like
an idiot for asking.

37:53.400 --> 37:54.600
Why?

37:54.700 --> 37:57.000
It only makes memakes oumakere.

38:05.500 --> 38:07.700
You know what? I-I actually
do have to go to work,

38:07.700 --> 38:10.800
And i don't want to get caught
getting busy in a 1970s ranchero...

38:10.900 --> 38:12.500
- okay.
- Beautiful as it is.

38:14.700 --> 38:15.800
I'll see you
when y get home?

38:15.800 --> 38:17.300
Okay.

38:27.600 --> 38:30.300
So, uh, lena quit last night.

38:31.900 --> 38:32.800
Did you ask her to?

38:32.800 --> 38:34.400
No. Holly said
it was her decision.

38:34.400 --> 38:36.700
I don't--
I don't know the details.

38:38.100 --> 38:40.600
Hey, come on,
this is a good thing.

38:40.900 --> 38:43.700
She's not the problem.
We are.

38:43.900 --> 38:45.500
I think we need
to see someone.

38:45.500 --> 38:47.300
And i know you don't like
to ask for help,

38:47.300 --> 38:48.500
And i know the last thing
you want to do

38:48.500 --> 38:51.900
Is talk to some stranger
about our personal lives, but...

38:52.200 --> 38:54.100
yes.

38:55.300 --> 38:58.600
Whatever it takes,
we'll do it.

38:59.300 --> 39:00.900
Thank you.

39:04.500 --> 39:05.400
Hey there.

39:05.500 --> 39:08.100
Mr. Finch. Missed you
on the plane this morning.

39:08.100 --> 39:09.700
I hope yvette made you
a nice breakfast.

39:09.700 --> 39:11.200
- Actually, it's yvonne.
- Oh.

39:11.300 --> 39:12.900
And, uh, would you
believe me if i told you

39:12.900 --> 39:14.400
She just wanted
investment advice,

39:14.400 --> 39:16.400
And i left her at
a perfectly reasonable hour?

39:16.500 --> 39:17.600
Not so much.

39:17.700 --> 39:19.400
Okay. Uh,

39:19.500 --> 39:23.000
I did advise her to invest in
a working alarm clock, though.

39:25.700 --> 39:27.800
Listen, uh, you were
right yesterday.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.600
I'd have scared them off.

39:29.900 --> 39:32.500
Well, you're the reason
we were there, so thank you.

39:34.300 --> 39:35.300
My pleasure.

39:35.300 --> 39:37.600
And i still owe you
a fun night out.

39:37.800 --> 39:39.300
Don't hold your breath.

39:39.400 --> 39:40.800
Okay.

39:48.700 --> 39:49.400
Hello?

39:49.400 --> 39:52.400
Oh, hey, i heard that dinner
went really well.

39:53.000 --> 39:54.500
- You did?
- Mm-Hmm

39:54.500 --> 39:56.500
You talked to him?
All right, what did he say?

39:56.600 --> 39:58.700
Oh, well, that's privilege
campaign information, mother.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.000
- Sorry.
- Kitty!

40:00.000 --> 40:04.200
Okay, he--He seemed
very happy, smitten, even.

40:04.300 --> 40:06.500
Smitten, even?

40:06.500 --> 40:09.700
He did. He just--He--He said
that he had a great time.

40:09.700 --> 40:11.000
- He did?
- Mm-Hmm.

40:11.100 --> 40:13.000
- You know what?
- What?

40:16.300 --> 40:18.500
We had a really great time.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.800
Okay. Okay.
Just remember, mom.

40:20.800 --> 40:22.800
Remember what you
always used to say to me.

40:22.800 --> 40:25.200
- Yeah?
- You just take it slow.

40:25.700 --> 40:27.300
You make him wait.

40:29.700 --> 40:30.900
Remember the last time
we were here?

40:30.900 --> 40:32.600
I'd just found out
you existed.

40:33.100 --> 40:34.700
Yeah, you were, ke,
the only one in your family

40:34.700 --> 40:36.700
That was actually
talking to me.
