MATT: Hey.

17:43.166 --> 17:44.208
Sorry to be late.

17:44.208 --> 17:46.000
I went to the Russian bakery
to get those little

17:46.000 --> 17:47.417
black-and-white cookies
that you love.

17:47.417 --> 17:48.750
The lady in front of me
bought the last ones.

17:48.750 --> 17:51.083
-Oh no!
-It worked out,

17:51.083 --> 17:52.917
'cause, apparently,
she was buying 'em for you.

That woman is here

18:09.000 --> 18:12.291

sink her claws back into Matt.

Matt hates her.
I'm not worried.

18:14.250 --> 18:16.250
You are way more confident
than I would be.

18:16.250 --> 18:18.208
I mean, they weren't
married for that long,

18:18.208 --> 18:21.041

off-again for, like, six years.

18:21.041 --> 18:23.458

that he can't quit.

18:23.458 --> 18:25.208
It's like me and Coffee Nips.

next to him on the wagon

18:27.125 --> 18:28.667

he falls off again.
