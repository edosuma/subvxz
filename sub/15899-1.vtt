could slurp a trout.

with a soup. You know that.

18:30.843 --> 18:32.843
- It's unbelievable.
- I trained at Juilliard...

18:32.927 --> 18:33.927
I am so very sorry.

18:34.010 --> 18:36.177
- Why?
- You're not her type.

18:37.593 --> 18:41.802
Now, I must warn you, I work very hard.

18:41.885 --> 18:45.093
I study an hour every day.

18:45.177 --> 18:46.968
Sometimes two.

18:47.052 --> 18:50.885
And my father didn't leave me
as much money as everybody thinks,

18:50.968 --> 18:55.177
so I couldn't pay you
more than a hundred and fifty.

18:55.260 --> 18:58.302
- A month?
- A week.

18:59.135 --> 19:01.010
I'm not destitute.

19:05.635 --> 19:09.135
A few pointers
as to how Madam Florence does things.

19:09.218 --> 19:12.302
You will note that she carries a leather
briefcase with her at all times.

19:12.385 --> 19:15.177
You are not to touch that briefcase
or to enquire as to its contents.

19:15.260 --> 19:16.260
Right.

19:16.343 --> 19:18.718
In the hall, Madam Florence
keeps a collection of chairs

19:18.802 --> 19:20.677
in which people of note have expired.

19:20.760 --> 19:23.010
- They're not for practical use.
- I understand.

19:23.093 --> 19:24.593
She abhors all pointed objects,

19:24.677 --> 19:28.552
so don't smoke in her presence or
hand her a knife or anything like that.

19:28.635 --> 19:31.552
- Are you fond of sandwiches?
- Yes.

19:31.635 --> 19:34.677
Good, good. Madam Florence
is inordinately fond of sandwiches.

19:34.760 --> 19:36.135
And potato salad as well.

19:36.218 --> 19:38.802
When we throw parties,
we make mountains of the stuff.

19:38.885 --> 19:41.427
It would serve you
to consume both with enthusiasm.

19:41.510 --> 19:43.510
- I shall.
- Good morning, Patrick.

19:50.218 --> 19:53.968
So, here is a week in advance

19:54.052 --> 19:57.260
and a teeny bit extra for a new shirt.

19:57.343 --> 19:58.802
Thank you.

19:58.885 --> 20:01.718
If you can forgive Madam Florence
her little eccentricities,

20:01.802 --> 20:05.177
you will find her to be
a most generous and delightful person.

20:05.260 --> 20:07.927
Ours is a very happy world.

20:09.135 --> 20:11.135
Welcome, Mr McMoon.

20:12.010 --> 20:14.052
Tomorrow morning at nine. Don't be late.

20:14.135 --> 20:16.468
- I won't, sir.
- Good.

20:21.135 --> 20:22.718
MAN: Taxi! Taxi!

20:25.385 --> 20:28.177
- DOORMAN: Good morning.
- WOMAN: Good morning.

20:51.052 --> 20:55.302
- Mr McMoon is here.
- Oh, do come in, Mr McMoon.

20:55.385 --> 20:58.468
This is the talented young man
I was telling you about.

20:58.552 --> 21:01.093
- How do you do, Mr McMoon?
- My vocal coach.

21:01.177 --> 21:04.927
Maestro Carlo Edwards, assistant
conductor at the Metropolitan Opera.

21:05.010 --> 21:09.468
How do you do, sir? I saw you conduct
La Bohème last season.

21:09.552 --> 21:11.593
Oh, no, please don't remind me.

21:11.677 --> 21:14.427
(LAUGHS) Carlo!

21:15.302 --> 21:17.468
- He's kidding. He's kidding.
- (LAUGHS)

- (FLORENCE CLEARS THROAT)

21:19.968 --> 21:23.552
- I'm virtually off score.
- Good. Then let's get started.

Oh. Isn't it a little early
in the morning for Lakmé, Carlo?

21:33.593 --> 21:35.968
Not for a singer of your ability.

21:39.177 --> 21:41.468

if you don't mind, Mr McMoon.

Maestro, it is true that a lot of
singers my age are on the decline,

but I seem to just get better and better.

I'm ready... for a concert?

You'll never be more ready.

for far too long, Bunny.

27:54.885 --> 27:56.052
Sure.

27:56.135 --> 27:59.343
And perhaps I shall perform a monologue.

28:01.510 --> 28:03.927
Or not. Or not.

28:04.010 --> 28:06.760
I shall start to make arrangements.

28:06.843 --> 28:10.552

to attend the concert,

28:10.635 --> 28:13.093

28:13.177 --> 28:15.843
Oh, right. When?

28:15.927 --> 28:18.593
Let me know when you've fixed a date.

28:18.677 --> 28:20.427
One other thing.

28:20.510 --> 28:23.468
Since I've been working so intensively
with Florence,

28:23.552 --> 28:25.802
I've rather neglected my other students.

28:25.885 --> 28:29.302
It might be best
if we were discreet about these classes.

28:29.385 --> 28:34.385

become the focus of any envy.

Doesn't she?

- Enjoy Florida.
- I will.

29:00.552 --> 29:01.718
Mr McMoon.

- Could we speak, Mr Bayfield?
- Yes, of course. What is it?

29:04.510 --> 29:09.968
Well, uh, I thought I was being hired
to accompany Madam Florence's lessons.

29:10.052 --> 29:11.677
Hm-hm.

29:11.760 --> 29:14.802
I'll be honest with you, Mr Bayfield,
I think Madam Florence

29:14.885 --> 29:20.052
might need a little more preparation
before she sings in public.

29:20.135 --> 29:22.468
- We've been rehearsing for a month.
- Well, I know.

29:22.552 --> 29:27.635
But from time to time,
she can be a little...

29:27.718 --> 29:30.302
- Hmm?
- ...flat.

29:31.010 --> 29:35.135
- Flat?
- A tad. Well, just a tad.

29:35.218 --> 29:37.260
Carlo Edwards didn't mention any flatness,

29:37.343 --> 29:39.260
and he is the leading vocal coach
in the city.

29:39.343 --> 29:42.218
Jeez, Mr Bayfield, we can't be talking
about the same singer.

29:42.302 --> 29:44.510
I mean, her vocal cords,
they don't phonate freely.

29:44.593 --> 29:45.927
Her phrasing is haphazard.

29:46.010 --> 29:50.802
As for her subglottal pressure...
it defies medical science.

29:50.885 --> 29:53.093
Is her instrument quite what it was?
Perhaps not.

29:53.177 --> 29:55.927
But as Beethoven said,
a few wrong notes may be forgiven,

29:56.010 --> 29:58.218
but singing without feeling cannot.

29:58.302 --> 30:03.093
Mr Bayfield, is there any way I could do
the lessons but not the concerts?

30:03.177 --> 30:06.135
- No, I'm afraid not.
- But I have my reputation to think of.

30:06.218 --> 30:08.510
Oh, really? And what reputation is that?

30:08.593 --> 30:12.468
If you want to go back to playing
for tips in a steakhouse, be my guest.

30:13.635 --> 30:16.552
Oh, Cosmé, Florence is very fond of you,

30:16.635 --> 30:19.510
she's paying you well and she knows,
well, she knows everyone.

30:19.593 --> 30:20.927
But, Mr Bayfield...

30:21.010 --> 30:24.260
And she has sung
in dozens of sell-out concerts.

30:24.343 --> 30:26.843
She has a magnetism
that her followers adore.

30:26.927 --> 30:32.343
I understand that, but what if less
educated members of the public show up?

30:32.427 --> 30:34.802
No, you're right, we must exclude
the hoodlum element

30:34.885 --> 30:37.510
and ensure that only
true music lovers gain entry.

30:37.593 --> 30:41.218
These events take
all kinds of careful preparation.

30:57.843 --> 31:01.385
So, five down and two to go.

31:01.468 --> 31:04.260
And have you attended
one of Madam Florence's concerts before?

31:04.343 --> 31:06.302
No, but I heard all about her. (CHUCKLES)

31:06.385 --> 31:09.593
Well, I'm afraid we're giving priority
to Verdi Club members at the moment.

31:09.677 --> 31:11.468
But I came all the way from Brooklyn.

31:11.552 --> 31:13.385

31:18.802 --> 31:21.093
Mr Stark, how very nice.

31:21.177 --> 31:22.552
That's Mr Bayfield.

Yes, thank you for calling back.

are Mozart, Verdi and Beethoven.

through your fat head.

31:36.135 --> 31:41.385

in your bullshit music club, OK?

31:41.468 --> 31:43.427
Agnes, please.

31:43.510 --> 31:44.552
My God.

31:44.635 --> 31:50.010
June 4th, Saturday night at 8pm.
Oh, I do so hope you can be there.

31:50.093 --> 31:53.635
Well, unfortunately we are rehearsing.

31:53.718 --> 31:57.718
- Oh, on Saturday night?
- Well, we rehearse all the time.

31:59.093 --> 32:02.218
Oh, my God. It's Toscanini, the conductor.

32:02.302 --> 32:07.093
Hmm, I thought it was Toscanini,
the anchovy paste salesman. Huh?

32:07.177 --> 32:09.427
Finally, the line below that should read:

32:09.510 --> 32:14.010
"Directed by St Clair Bayfield,
eminent actor and monologist."

32:15.677 --> 32:16.677
"Eminent", yes.

32:22.302 --> 32:25.343
Thank you, Mr Lipshitz.
Thank you very much.

32:25.427 --> 32:28.468
St Clair, who is that vulgar woman?

32:28.552 --> 32:31.927
- The new Mrs Stark, I imagine.
- What happened to the last one?

32:32.010 --> 32:34.343
- Who is that man, anyway?
- Phineas?

32:34.427 --> 32:36.302
- Hmm.
- He sells meat in cans.

32:36.385 --> 32:39.635
- Very wealthy. Very generous.
- Oh.

32:39.718 --> 32:41.677
I understand Agnes isn't a member.

32:41.760 --> 32:44.135
She's new to the world of classical music.

32:44.218 --> 32:47.468
But she's very keen to learn.

32:47.552 --> 32:50.718
Well, in that case,
I think we can make an exception.

32:50.802 --> 32:53.635
- Four dollars, please.
- Thank you so much.

32:53.718 --> 32:58.927
A whole world of pleasure
awaits you, Mrs Stark.

32:59.010 --> 33:01.718
Well, you can never have
too much pleasure.

33:02.927 --> 33:04.135
Right?

33:06.010 --> 33:08.010
Oh, right.

33:08.093 --> 33:12.260
So, that is two tickets for the Levis
and a dollar change.

33:12.343 --> 33:13.635
- Thank you.
- Now, then.

33:13.718 --> 33:17.677
Oh, Mr Bayfield. I am so excited.

33:17.760 --> 33:20.385
Well, we all are.
I have put you in row E, Mrs Vanderbilt.

33:20.468 --> 33:23.802
E for elegance. Four dollars if I may.

33:24.760 --> 33:26.468
- Excuse me.
- Thank you.

33:29.927 --> 33:34.302
They're getting through the potato salad
like gannets. Is there any more?

33:34.385 --> 33:35.677
Let me check.

33:37.718 --> 33:40.010
How's it going, Kitty? Are we running low?

33:40.093 --> 33:42.677
I think we should be fine, Mr Bayfield.

33:42.760 --> 33:45.927
- Very good. I'll take that.
- Thank you, Mr Bayfield.

33:51.718 --> 33:54.427
There's an Earl Wilson here.

33:57.385 --> 33:59.760
Send him in. Thank you, Kitty.

34:01.510 --> 34:03.093
KITTY: Through there.

34:03.885 --> 34:06.927
- Earl Wilson of the New York Post.
- How do you do, Mr Bayfield?

34:07.010 --> 34:09.552
How do you do?
I read your column. It's great fun.

34:09.635 --> 34:11.592
- Thank you.
- What brings you here?

34:11.677 --> 34:14.217
I was hoping
I could get a ticket for the concert.

34:14.302 --> 34:16.052
Oh, well, I'm afraid we're all sold out.

34:16.135 --> 34:19.052
Oh? Carlton Smith
from the Musical Courier has got one.

34:19.135 --> 34:21.135
So has Stubbs from World Bugle.

34:21.217 --> 34:22.302
I'm not sure it's an event

34:22.385 --> 34:24.760
that would interest the readers
of the New York Post.

34:24.842 --> 34:28.010
My editor would disagree. There's
quite a buzz around town about it.

34:28.092 --> 34:30.052
He sent me down here himself.

34:30.135 --> 34:32.177
So, can I get that ticket?

34:33.635 --> 34:35.510
Why not?

34:35.592 --> 34:37.010
Thank you.

34:48.342 --> 34:50.177
Voilà.

34:50.260 --> 34:51.842
I just need the ticket.

34:51.927 --> 34:54.052
It's both or neither, Mr Wilson.

34:54.135 --> 34:55.842
Then I'll trouble you no more.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.968
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

35:07.177 --> 35:09.052
(WOMAN LAUGHS) Yes.

35:09.135 --> 35:11.510
WOMAN: Darling. Augustus is here.

35:11.593 --> 35:13.635
Ah, what a surprise.

35:13.718 --> 35:16.343
- How are you, Augustus?
- AUGUSTUS: Couldn't be better.

35:16.427 --> 35:18.510
I hear your play was a triumph.

35:18.593 --> 35:21.968
I am a second-rate playwright
and we all know that.

35:22.052 --> 35:25.885
But I'm a first-rate friend, the latter
outweighing the former, I feel.

35:25.968 --> 35:27.885
With knobs on.

35:27.968 --> 35:31.343
- So, is it really true?
- What's that?

35:31.427 --> 35:34.343
Madam Florence
is taking to the stage once more?

35:34.427 --> 35:37.343
- Yes.
- Ah, it's been too long.

35:37.427 --> 35:40.718
- How much are tickets?
- I'm afraid we've already sold out.

35:40.802 --> 35:42.843
- You can't be sold out.
- I'm so sorry.

35:42.927 --> 35:47.843
- St Clair, don't be a silly arse.
- Yes, don't be a silly arse, St Clair.

35:47.927 --> 35:49.885
The concert is for true music lovers,

35:49.968 --> 35:52.593
not mockers and scoffers
like you and your artistic friends.

35:52.677 --> 35:55.468
When have I ever mocked or scoffed?

35:56.843 --> 36:00.052
The lady is an eloquent lesson
in fidelity and courage,

36:00.135 --> 36:02.718
and that's why we love her.

36:02.802 --> 36:06.177
Please, St Clair.
Do you want to see a grown man cry?

36:06.260 --> 36:08.677
Be a sport, darling,
and I'll make it up to you.

36:08.760 --> 36:10.677
- No, I'm sorry.
- Please.

36:10.760 --> 36:12.802
No. Non. Nyet.

36:15.843 --> 36:16.885
MAN: Tickets, please.

36:16.968 --> 36:18.677
Thank you. Tickets, please.

36:18.760 --> 36:20.260
You're very lucky to be here.

36:20.343 --> 36:22.427
You've made promises
and I'm holding you to them.

36:22.510 --> 36:24.302
I've brought some friends. Music lovers.

36:24.385 --> 36:27.927
We'll see. I'm watching them carefully.

36:28.010 --> 36:30.177
Carlton Smith. And Mr Stubbs.

36:30.260 --> 36:33.010
We're greatly honoured.
I hope you enjoy the evening.

36:33.093 --> 36:35.260
- We will, St Clair.
- Fingers crossed.

36:36.427 --> 36:40.427
Tell the ushers that absolutely no one
gets in without a ticket. No exceptions.

36:40.510 --> 36:44.885
And if Earl Wilson turns up from the
Post, they politely show him the door.

36:46.093 --> 36:47.593
Mr and Mrs Stark. How very nice.

36:47.677 --> 36:51.302
Will you forgive me?
I have an important nose to powder.

36:51.385 --> 36:52.677
This is beautiful, isn't it?

36:54.635 --> 36:55.843
Oh, God.

36:58.552 --> 37:00.718
- All set?
- I guess.

37:00.802 --> 37:04.052
They are going to adore you.
You have my word.

37:04.135 --> 37:06.135
(WHIMPERS)

37:07.177 --> 37:09.010
(GROANS)

37:16.885 --> 37:19.177
Too many? Too many feathers you think?

37:19.260 --> 37:21.718
The perfect number of feathers.
Restrained and elegant.

37:21.802 --> 37:24.677
- I'm so nervous, Whitey.
- Oh, don't be.

37:24.760 --> 37:27.593
- Are you nervous, Mr McMoon?
- Somewhat.

37:27.677 --> 37:29.260
You have a full and very warm house

37:29.343 --> 37:33.260
and you are both going to be sensational.

37:33.343 --> 37:34.760
Ready?

37:34.843 --> 37:36.385
Hm-hm. Yes.

37:36.468 --> 37:37.677
Break a leg.

37:40.718 --> 37:42.177
House lights, please.

37:44.677 --> 37:49.135
This is what we live for, isn't it?

37:53.343 --> 37:55.885
This moment.

- Oh, Mr Bayfield.

I don't hear very well, but I just think
Madam Florence is magical.

Well, I know how very grateful she is
for your friendship and your support.

- Absolutely thrilling.
- Is everything alright?

42:20.885 --> 42:23.218
Let's get you home.

Dr Hertz is in Washington,
but he sent his colleague Dr Hermann.

42:38.593 --> 42:40.302
If I may, please.

42:50.635 --> 42:52.843
I didn't have time
to look at your medical notes.

42:52.927 --> 42:55.843
The scarring is from syphilis.

42:55.927 --> 42:58.552
When did you contract the disease?

42:59.635 --> 43:01.677
On my wedding night.

43:02.427 --> 43:07.218
My first husband,
Dr Frank Thornton Jenkins.

43:09.593 --> 43:11.302
Something of an alley cat.

43:12.593 --> 43:15.593
- How old were you?
- 18.

43:15.677 --> 43:19.260
- Where did the chancre first appear?
- It was on my left hand, right here.

43:19.343 --> 43:25.135
- Are you taking any medication?
- Just mercury and arsenic, of course.

43:25.218 --> 43:27.385
- Any other symptoms?
- No.

43:27.468 --> 43:31.635
She has seizures from time to time,
when she has overexerted herself.

43:31.718 --> 43:33.135
DR HERMANN: I see.

43:33.218 --> 43:35.927
Well, there is a murmur
and some palpitations

43:36.010 --> 43:39.968
but no indication the disease
is entering the tertiary phase.

43:40.052 --> 43:43.593
The two and a half hours of coloratura
you performed this evening

43:43.677 --> 43:46.468
- might account for the tiredness.

43:46.552 --> 43:50.552

43:51.093 --> 43:53.593
I'll speak to Dr Hertz and let him know.

43:53.677 --> 43:55.010
Thank you, Doctor.

43:56.677 --> 43:57.802
Thank you.

43:59.593 --> 44:04.093
I've known patients survive 20 years
with syphilis but never nearly 50.

44:04.177 --> 44:06.677
I'm amazed. What is her secret?

44:06.760 --> 44:09.343
Music. She lives for music.

44:09.427 --> 44:12.385
And no doubt your love
has proved to be a panacea too.

44:12.468 --> 44:14.302
We were fortunate
to have found each other.

44:14.385 --> 44:18.593
Clearly. I don't mean to pry,
Mr Bayfield, but how is your own health?

44:19.927 --> 44:22.052
Florence and I have always abstained.

44:22.135 --> 44:23.593
Very wise.

44:23.677 --> 44:26.552
I have several patients
who observe the five-year rule,

44:26.635 --> 44:28.927
but it's no sure prophylactic.

44:29.010 --> 44:32.385
Well, from the start, Florence felt
that my health was paramount.

44:32.468 --> 44:37.635
Excitement stimulates the disease.
She needs rest, Mr Bayfield.

44:38.593 --> 44:40.135
Rest.

45:01.010 --> 45:02.593
Rest, my love.

45:06.760 --> 45:11.343
I can't help wondering
what my life would have been like

45:11.427 --> 45:13.843
if I'd never met Frank Jenkins.

45:13.927 --> 45:17.302
Well, he's in his grave now. Forget him.

45:20.093 --> 45:24.760
But I could've...
could've given you a child.

45:29.385 --> 45:31.343
We could've been a family.

45:31.427 --> 45:33.260
We are a family.

45:34.718 --> 45:39.968
A great and devoted family.
United by our love of music.

45:43.677 --> 45:45.510
Are we not happy?

45:48.718 --> 45:50.802
Hmm?

45:50.885 --> 45:53.010
Shut your eyes. I'll recite for you.

hung aloft the night,

01:00:44.343 --> 01:00:48.718
with the most beautiful smile
I'd ever seen.

01:00:51.468 --> 01:00:56.093
He had an aristocratic bearing
and that was that.

01:00:56.177 --> 01:00:58.760
Of course, his grandfather
was an earl, you know.

01:00:58.843 --> 01:01:02.427
Doesn't that make him an earl too?

01:01:02.510 --> 01:01:05.093
Well, he wasn't on the legitimate line.

01:01:05.177 --> 01:01:07.052
Nothing for him in England.

01:01:07.135 --> 01:01:10.885
So he came here and became an actor.

01:01:12.802 --> 01:01:18.052
He wasn't always successful.
Had to hide the reviews occasionally.

01:01:19.177 --> 01:01:22.052
- You play so beautifully, Mr McMoon.
- Ah!

01:01:23.260 --> 01:01:27.177
You know, I played for the president,
when I was eight years old.

01:01:28.427 --> 01:01:30.760
- Really?
- Yes, I played at the White House.

01:01:30.843 --> 01:01:33.885
- Really?
- Little Miss Foster, they called me.

01:01:33.968 --> 01:01:38.468
And I had very high hopes
of becoming a concert pianist mys...

01:01:38.552 --> 01:01:43.718
But then when the nerves were damaged
in my left hand, that was not to be.

01:01:43.802 --> 01:01:47.468
That's too bad.
What happened to your hand?

01:01:47.552 --> 01:01:50.677
Oh, it was just a...

- No.

When Mr Bayfield is away playing golf,
the days can seem awfully long.

01:02:31.843 --> 01:02:36.635
I understand that he needs his... sport.

01:02:36.718 --> 01:02:40.052

- Hmm.

01:02:57.343 --> 01:02:59.552

triumph here more than I, obviously.

it's so big, you know.

Yes, but she's a young woman
with a young woman's strength and...

- No, it is, it is, it is, but I...

this might be too much for you.

had adopted that attitude,

01:09:04.218 --> 01:09:08.093
why, Herr Hitler would be standing
on the balcony of Buckingham Palace

- Yes, you certainly are.

01:13:16.093 --> 01:13:19.052
Oh, you think that I didn't
have ambition? I was a good actor.

to admit that to myself.

from the tyranny of ambition.

without loyalty, there's nothing.

the mockers and scoffers at bay.

you to part with your newspaper?
