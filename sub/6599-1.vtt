04:10.564 --> 04:12.722
You there, which way
to Pepperinge Eye?

04:12.816 --> 04:16.731
Couldn't say, sir. It said on the
wireless to paint out the signposts

04:16.820 --> 04:19.490
in case the Nazis drop in.

04:19.572 --> 04:21.945
I'm not a Nazi!
I'm a British officer!

04:22.034 --> 04:26.032
That's what you'd say
if you was a Nazi, isn't it, sir?

04:26.121 --> 04:28.280
Drive on, corporal.

04:49.019 --> 04:51.854
Sorry to give you so many
but you do have six bedrooms.

04:51.939 --> 04:54.809
No trouble.
Anything to get the poor things away

04:54.900 --> 04:57.901
from those terrible
bombings in London.

05:00.948 --> 05:03.617
What about us?

05:03.701 --> 05:06.618
- Oh, yes. What is your name?
- Rawlins, ma'am.

05:08.789 --> 05:11.410
Oh, yes. Here we are. Carrie.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.160
Charles.

05:13.252 --> 05:15.209
Paul.

05:15.295 --> 05:17.965
You're for Miss Price.
I'm expecting her in.

05:18.048 --> 05:21.168
- Call out the navy
- I won't be a moment.

05:21.260 --> 05:23.051
Please don't touch anything.

05:23.137 --> 05:25.544
Call out the tanks

05:25.639 --> 05:29.803
From the Cliffs of Dover,
call up the gulls

05:29.893 --> 05:34.354
And don't forget
the loyal territorials

05:34.440 --> 05:38.568
But who's digging in here?
Who will defend

05:38.652 --> 05:42.864
Every inch of England,
no matter what they send?

05:42.948 --> 05:47.112
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?

05:47.202 --> 05:51.496
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,
that's who

05:51.582 --> 05:55.745
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard

05:55.836 --> 06:00.332
We wrote the story
of the old brigades

06:00.424 --> 06:04.671
We know the glory
of yesterday's parades

06:04.762 --> 06:08.842
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?

06:08.932 --> 06:13.013
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,
that's who

06:13.103 --> 06:18.061
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard

06:19.651 --> 06:22.818
- Halt!
- Carry on, sergeant.

06:22.905 --> 06:25.941
Captain Greer, sir,
from headquarters at Tidbury,

06:26.033 --> 06:28.156
here to check military preparations.

06:28.243 --> 06:31.114
Tell them Pepperinge Eye
has matters well in hand.

06:31.205 --> 06:34.656
Nevertheless, I...
What on earth is that?

06:43.384 --> 06:46.634
Good morning, General.
I received your message, Mrs Hobday.

06:46.720 --> 06:49.591
- I assume my parcel has arrived.
- It's in the office.

06:49.682 --> 06:50.761
How lovely.

06:53.268 --> 06:56.186
- Who is that?
- Miss Price. Splendid woman.

06:56.271 --> 06:58.560
Her late father served with me.

06:58.649 --> 07:01.318
What does she burn in this?
It smells like sulphur.

07:01.402 --> 07:04.687
Ridiculous! One can't make
motor fuel out of sulphur!

07:04.780 --> 07:09.608
Here we are. Another object from
Professor Emelius Browne in London.

07:09.702 --> 07:12.786
- Thank you.
- Is it what you expected?

07:12.871 --> 07:18.114
- I imagine so.
- He sent you a cat last time.

07:20.421 --> 07:23.624
- Professor Browne is well?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

07:23.716 --> 07:26.716
Are we to have
the pleasure of meeting him?

07:26.802 --> 07:29.838
I doubt it. I don't know
Professor Browne personally.

07:29.930 --> 07:33.097
- Was there something else?
- Yes. Would you come this way?

07:33.183 --> 07:35.853
- I'm very anxious to get home.
- Come along, please.

07:37.980 --> 07:42.309
- Get down, Charlie. I want a ride!
- Bash him one!

07:42.401 --> 07:44.477
Stop it this instant!

07:45.904 --> 07:48.395
Children, this is Miss Price.

07:48.490 --> 07:52.025
Carrie, Charles and Paul Rawlins,
all the way from London.

07:52.119 --> 07:54.325
- How do you do?
- How are you, miss?

07:54.413 --> 07:58.790
The government are trying to evacuate
children into the country.

07:58.876 --> 08:02.161
- Very sensible.
- Today they sent us 45.

08:02.254 --> 08:06.252
And I've had to find homes
for all of them at very short notice.

08:06.342 --> 08:13.803
These are the last three. All right,
children. Pick up your things.

08:13.891 --> 08:16.975
You're not suggesting I take
these children into my house?

08:17.061 --> 08:21.272
- Exactly.
- That's quite out of the question.

08:21.357 --> 08:23.433
Children and I don't get on.

08:24.068 --> 08:27.437
I'll believe you, miss.
Come on. Back to London.

08:27.529 --> 08:28.988
Be quiet.

08:29.573 --> 08:31.815
Besides, I have important work to do.

08:31.909 --> 08:34.993
Miss Price, you do have
that entire house to yourself.

08:35.078 --> 08:39.621
According to the Ministry of
Civil Defence, you have no choice.

08:39.707 --> 08:40.989
I see.

08:41.085 --> 08:43.658
If that is the case
I shall take them into my house,

08:43.754 --> 08:47.704
with the understanding that you find
another home as soon as possible.

08:47.800 --> 08:49.591
Fine. Come along.

08:55.099 --> 08:58.218
Good morning, Miss Price.
There they are!

08:58.310 --> 09:01.228
Oh, Miss Price, what a charitable
thing you are doing,

09:01.313 --> 09:03.851
taking in these
poor unfortunates from the city.

09:03.941 --> 09:07.689
- Hold this very carefully.
- I wonder if I may drop by later.

09:07.778 --> 09:11.396
- Why?
- Consider their spiritual needs.

09:11.490 --> 09:14.574
That won't be necessary.
They won't be with me for long.

09:36.223 --> 09:38.381
My parcel, please.

09:38.475 --> 09:40.551
Bring your things inside.

09:43.772 --> 09:46.477
- Bit murky, ain't it?
- Yeah.

09:46.567 --> 09:49.733
Not another house
round here for miles.

09:52.906 --> 09:55.777
- Wipe your feet.
- Big place, this.

09:55.868 --> 09:58.785
- Who else lives here?
- I live alone.

09:58.871 --> 10:00.863
It suits my purpose.

10:02.624 --> 10:05.294
All right. Come along, everybody.

10:16.597 --> 10:19.052
Sorry, miss. The cat startled us.

10:19.141 --> 10:22.177
No need for alarm.
You just frightened him.

10:23.103 --> 10:26.188
Yeah, he's scared to death.
You can see that!

10:28.108 --> 10:31.892
- What do you call your cat?
- I don't give animals silly names.

10:31.987 --> 10:36.234
I call him Cosmic Creepers
because that's the name he came with.

10:36.325 --> 10:39.528
You will sleep in here.
This was my father's bedroom.

10:39.620 --> 10:41.862
Be very careful of everything in it.

10:41.955 --> 10:44.791
- You boys take the bed there.
- All right, miss.

10:44.875 --> 10:46.915
- What was your name?
- Carrie, miss.

10:47.002 --> 10:50.252
- You sleep in the sofa in there.
- Thank you, miss.

10:50.339 --> 10:53.838
- Is that all you brought?
- We ain't exactly burdened down.

10:53.926 --> 10:56.215
Travel light, that's us.

10:57.179 --> 10:59.219
I don't think this is going to work

10:59.306 --> 11:01.465
but it seems
that I have no alternative.

11:01.558 --> 11:03.717
We'll do our best, miss.
Really, we will.

11:03.811 --> 11:07.014
Thank you, Carrie.
The bathroom is along the landing.

11:07.106 --> 11:10.439
- Supper is at 6:00. You will wash...
- Wash?

11:10.526 --> 11:13.776
You will wash yourselves
otherwise there will be no supper.

11:13.862 --> 11:16.188
Is that clear?

11:17.658 --> 11:21.109
A house of horror.
That's what we've come to.

11:27.960 --> 11:32.088
Please don't bother to whisper.
I'm exceptionally keen of hearing.

11:32.172 --> 11:34.331
You are planning
to run back to London.

11:34.425 --> 11:36.713
Please do your plotting elsewhere

11:36.802 --> 11:38.629
where I shan't have to listen to it.

11:38.762 --> 11:41.432
I don't know much
about what children eat.

11:41.515 --> 11:43.508
You'll have to make do as I do.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.091
Is there anything in particular
that you fancy?

11:46.186 --> 11:48.891
Sausage and mash,
bubble and squeak,

11:48.981 --> 11:50.973
toad in the hole, fried fish...

11:51.066 --> 11:52.644
Anything at all.

11:52.735 --> 11:55.819
You won't find any fried foods
in this house.

11:55.904 --> 11:57.612
- No fried food?
- No.

11:57.698 --> 11:59.904
How do you keep your health?

11:59.992 --> 12:01.700
Cabbage buds, rosehips,

12:01.785 --> 12:07.076
hyssop seed, elm bark,
wattle yeast and stewed nettles.

13:02.554 --> 13:04.346
"Dear Madam. With this shipment,

13:04.431 --> 13:07.136
the Emelius Browne
College of Witchcraft

13:07.226 --> 13:09.099
sends you its congratulations

13:09.186 --> 13:12.637
on qualifying for the first degree
of your chosen calling."

13:12.731 --> 13:16.563
"You may now call yourself
'apprentice witch'."

13:17.569 --> 13:20.357
"Yours faithfully, Emelius Browne."

13:27.371 --> 13:29.529
My first broom.

13:33.919 --> 13:35.959
Time to go. Everybody up.

13:38.090 --> 13:40.415
Wake up, Paul.
We're going back to London.

13:40.968 --> 13:43.210
Let's see how we fly this thing.

13:43.971 --> 13:46.047
Here we are.

13:47.558 --> 13:50.512
"Clasp the broom with both hands."

13:51.270 --> 13:53.393
Yes, of course.

14:00.946 --> 14:03.402
"Never astride the broom."
Oh, yes, of course.

14:03.490 --> 14:07.073
"A witch is always a lady unless
circumstances dictate otherwise."

14:07.161 --> 14:10.695
"Take an easy, graceful
sideways position."

14:10.789 --> 14:15.451
Of course, that's much better.
An easy, graceful sideways position.

14:15.544 --> 14:18.664
There we are. How's that?

14:20.215 --> 14:23.169
"To start up the broom,
your basic formula:

14:23.260 --> 14:27.128
La kipo necriff scrumpet leech!"

14:29.516 --> 14:31.675
I wasn't ready!

14:52.206 --> 14:54.163
Now watch this.

14:58.295 --> 14:59.837
Here we go.

15:21.527 --> 15:24.018
It's going to be
a little different this time.

15:29.702 --> 15:32.275
All right. I know it's not ladylike.

16:26.216 --> 16:28.209
What's the matter?

16:30.679 --> 16:32.921
- How does she do that?
- She's a witch.

16:33.015 --> 16:35.684
That's the sort of thing witches do.

16:53.786 --> 16:56.407
She don't fly good, do she?

17:02.252 --> 17:05.502
- She's crashed!
- Now's our chance to hop it!

17:05.589 --> 17:09.290
- Suppose she's hurt.
- Go on! You can't hurt a witch.

17:10.260 --> 17:11.719
Look out!

17:19.019 --> 17:21.806
She's proper cross now.
Let's get away from here.

17:21.896 --> 17:25.313
Hang on. I'm having a bit of a think.

17:25.401 --> 17:27.358
A witch she is, says you.

17:27.444 --> 17:30.066
Then let's use the old loaf, says I.

17:30.155 --> 17:33.738
- Let's get back to London.
- What we have here is an opportunity.

17:33.826 --> 17:37.277
She don't want anyone
to know she's a witch, does she?

17:37.371 --> 17:40.491
- Not ruddy likely.
- That's the opportunity.

17:40.582 --> 17:43.667
And I intend to make
the most of it. Come on.

17:44.503 --> 17:47.076
- Bran porridge.
- Thank you, miss.

17:47.172 --> 17:49.248
Very healthful, I'm sure!

17:50.926 --> 17:54.509
- Hurt your foot, Miss Price?
- Just twisted my ankle.

17:54.596 --> 17:57.716
- Sorry to hear that.
- Thank you. It's nothing serious.

17:58.726 --> 18:01.513
Lovely weather for flying last night.

18:06.358 --> 18:08.814
Why did you say that, Charles?

18:08.902 --> 18:11.987
Game's up, Miss Price.
We know what you are.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.031
I see.

18:17.703 --> 18:21.036
Don't worry, Miss Price.
No one's gonna peach on you.

18:22.249 --> 18:26.461
Thank you. I should be most grateful
if you didn't tell anyone.

18:26.545 --> 18:30.673
Course there would have to be one
or two little changes made round here.

18:30.758 --> 18:34.506
I mean, I'd like to see an occasional
sausage on the table here.

18:34.595 --> 18:37.264
- A bit of strawberry jam.
- Charlie!

18:37.348 --> 18:40.681
Let me handle this.
And another thing, Miss Price.

18:40.768 --> 18:44.717
There will be no more of this wash,
wash, wash, morning and night.

18:44.813 --> 18:46.972
Anything else?

18:47.066 --> 18:50.565
Now you mention it,
I could do with a bit of lolly.

18:51.278 --> 18:53.105
Lolly?

18:53.197 --> 18:55.735
Cash. Cold, hard cash.

18:55.824 --> 18:58.196
You must have buckets of it.

18:58.285 --> 19:02.698
The most accomplished of witches
can't make money out of thin air.

19:02.790 --> 19:05.494
Have you ever heard of a rich witch?

19:05.584 --> 19:10.045
Be that as it may,
you don't want us to blab, do you?

19:10.130 --> 19:13.215
Have you considered
what danger you might be in?

19:13.300 --> 19:16.135
I am a witch, you know.

19:16.220 --> 19:19.505
What will you do?
Turn me into a toad?

19:19.598 --> 19:22.089
Lovely. A toad with pink eyes.

19:23.143 --> 19:27.058
- I might just do that.
- Go on, then. I dare you.

19:27.147 --> 19:28.642
Very well, Charles.

19:31.443 --> 19:34.943
- You shouldn't have said that to her.
- She don't frighten me.

19:35.030 --> 19:36.939
She can't even ride a proper broom.

19:37.032 --> 19:39.191
Excuse me, Charles.

19:39.284 --> 19:42.155
Filigree, apogee,

19:42.246 --> 19:45.579
pedigree, perigee.

19:47.167 --> 19:49.326
Oh, Charlie!

19:50.379 --> 19:52.786
That's better than a toad!
That's a rabbit!

19:52.881 --> 19:55.551
Bother! I never seem
to be able to manage toads.

20:00.556 --> 20:02.798
Stop! Leave him alone!

20:04.935 --> 20:08.470
- Don't let Charlie get hurt.
- My spells don't last very long.

20:08.564 --> 20:10.391
I'm just an apprentice witch.

20:21.827 --> 20:23.867
Look out, Charlie!

20:32.588 --> 20:35.873
You flaming brute!

20:36.925 --> 20:40.259
I'll teach you to do that to me!

20:40.346 --> 20:43.430
Let Cosmic Creepers alone.
Weren't his fault.

20:44.016 --> 20:45.427
I'm afraid it's my fault.

20:45.517 --> 20:47.843
Bad enough not being able
to manage a broom.

20:47.936 --> 20:51.140
I can't perform
a simple, basic spell.

20:51.231 --> 20:55.229
You dared her to do it.
I don't see why we can't all be friends.

20:55.319 --> 20:57.810
Maybe she's not a wicked witch.

20:57.905 --> 20:59.897
Of course I'm not!

20:59.990 --> 21:03.240
- See?
- If only I could trust you.

21:03.327 --> 21:07.194
You see, the work I'm doing
is so important to the war effort.

21:07.289 --> 21:10.954
- How do you mean?
- I mean exceptionally important.

21:11.043 --> 21:12.834
Most secret.

21:13.504 --> 21:16.125
What do you say, Charlie?
We can keep a secret.

21:16.215 --> 21:19.749
Yeah. If someone
made it worth our while.

21:20.844 --> 21:21.959
I don't follow.

21:22.054 --> 21:25.968
Simple. You give us something
valuable to seal the pact.

21:26.058 --> 21:28.763
Oh, Charlie,
don't try to be clever again.

21:28.852 --> 21:30.892
It's for our own protection,
ain't it?

21:30.979 --> 21:35.143
If we broke the pact, we'd have
to give back the valuable object.

21:35.234 --> 21:38.400
I think it's an excellent idea.

21:38.487 --> 21:43.528
I wonder what I could give you.
Would you settle for one of my spells?

21:43.617 --> 21:45.823
Bet that's not worth much.

21:46.620 --> 21:48.660
Come with me.

21:52.543 --> 21:56.243
- I like you better as a rabbit.
- Shut up, you.

21:56.338 --> 21:58.082
Well, I never had a rabbit.

22:00.134 --> 22:02.589
Careful what you touch in here.

22:04.763 --> 22:06.970
Rum sort of place, ain't it?

22:08.267 --> 22:11.600
When I signed for my witchcraft
course there was a free bonus,

22:11.687 --> 22:15.601
a marvellous travelling spell
if you paid in advance.

22:15.691 --> 22:17.897
I think I'll give you that one.

22:17.985 --> 22:20.476
- Is it valuable?
- Certainly.

22:24.116 --> 22:26.524
Poisoned dragon's liver?

22:28.495 --> 22:32.279
You mean you poison the dragon
or just the liver?

22:32.374 --> 22:35.743
It comes prepared.
It's part of the school equipment.

22:35.836 --> 22:38.505
Here we are. The travelling spell.

22:38.589 --> 22:40.665
Everybody gather round.

22:42.843 --> 22:44.717
All right now. Let's see.

22:44.803 --> 22:47.473
Does any one of you have
a bracelet or a ring?

22:47.556 --> 22:50.510
- Something that you can twist.
- No, Miss Price.

22:50.601 --> 22:54.266
- What about you, Paul?
- Always carry a few things around.

22:54.355 --> 22:58.933
Never know when they might come
in useful. Piece of blue glass.

22:59.026 --> 23:00.900
Lovely bit of string.

23:02.071 --> 23:04.028
Horseshoe nail.

23:05.741 --> 23:07.116
What's that?

23:07.201 --> 23:09.739
Knob from the bed upstairs.

23:09.828 --> 23:13.992
- It twists, don't it?
- Yeah. Twisted right off.

23:14.083 --> 23:16.455
Yes, I think that will be all right.

23:16.543 --> 23:19.912
Carrie, turn the light down
a little bit, will you?

23:31.600 --> 23:34.387
Hellebore, henbane, aconite...

23:37.606 --> 23:41.307
glow-worm fire, firefly light!

23:44.321 --> 23:46.693
There. Isn't that pretty?

23:46.782 --> 23:48.940
Is that all we get?

23:49.034 --> 23:52.284
This knob will now work
the famous travelling spell.

23:52.371 --> 23:55.040
And what's
the famous travelling spell?

23:55.124 --> 23:57.697
- How does it work?
- You take this knob

23:57.793 --> 23:59.786
and put it back on the bed upstairs.

23:59.878 --> 24:02.416
Then turn it smartly
a quarter turn to the left

24:02.506 --> 24:05.756
then in a firm, clear voice,
tell it where you want to go

24:05.843 --> 24:07.966
and the bed will take you there.

24:08.053 --> 24:09.084
Go on!

24:09.179 --> 24:12.928
- Will it really?
- I see no reason to think otherwise.

24:13.976 --> 24:16.681
Thank you for the lovely gift.

24:16.770 --> 24:20.768
Sorry, but it belongs to Paul. He's the
only one who can work the spell.

24:20.858 --> 24:23.230
- Me?
- Yes.

24:23.318 --> 24:26.485
That's right. My knob, weren't it?

24:26.572 --> 24:28.280
That's the way the spell works.

24:28.365 --> 24:31.117
Nice mess he'll make of things.

24:33.412 --> 24:36.199
Oh, bother.
You children run upstairs.

24:36.290 --> 24:39.125
Don't try anything with the bedknob
till I get back.

24:40.794 --> 24:42.870
"Dear Madam,
it grieves me to inform you

24:42.963 --> 24:47.091
that we have been forced to close
down our College of Witchcraft."

24:47.176 --> 24:50.342
"This means that we shall not
be sending you the final lesson

24:50.429 --> 24:52.837
in which you expressed
so much interest."

24:56.101 --> 24:59.719
- What's keeping you?
- I've had some very bad news.

24:59.813 --> 25:01.972
Is there anything we can do?

25:02.066 --> 25:04.189
No. No, thank you.

25:05.361 --> 25:06.819
Yes.

25:06.904 --> 25:09.573
Yes, there is something
that Paul can do.

25:09.656 --> 25:11.945
- Me?
- I need the bedknob back.

25:12.034 --> 25:16.779
- I must get to London.
- No. I want to go to the jungle.

25:16.872 --> 25:19.161
Come with me, Paul.

25:23.712 --> 25:26.168
Now, Paul.
Ridiculous as it may seem

25:26.256 --> 25:28.664
to have to explain this
to a six-year-old,

25:28.759 --> 25:32.210
- I do need your help.
- Go ahead.

25:32.304 --> 25:34.926
I was expecting
a very important spell in the mail

25:35.015 --> 25:38.550
from my teacher, Professor Emelius
Browne, and it hasn't come.

25:38.644 --> 25:40.933
What's that got to do with my knob?

25:41.021 --> 25:44.188
I must go to London immediately
and see Professor Browne.

25:44.274 --> 25:49.649
With his help, we may be able
to bring this war to a successful end.

25:49.738 --> 25:51.778
That is why I need the knob.

25:51.865 --> 25:53.941
What is your decision?

26:00.541 --> 26:02.747
Thank you, Paul.

26:05.170 --> 26:07.708
I brought this for your hair.
It may be windy.

26:07.798 --> 26:09.791
Thank you. It's ever so nice.

26:09.883 --> 26:12.671
Paul, have you been
to the bathroom?

26:12.761 --> 26:14.670
- Twice.
- Good.

26:14.763 --> 26:17.089
Charles, put on something warmer.

26:17.182 --> 26:19.305
The bed may travel quite fast.

26:19.393 --> 26:22.477
I'm not going.
I'm staying right here.

26:22.563 --> 26:24.520
But why?

26:24.606 --> 26:29.601
All that rubbish about a travelling bed.
It won't work. That's why.

26:29.695 --> 26:32.482
Carrie, help me to pull the bed out.

26:32.573 --> 26:35.858
We don't want to scratch the wall
when we take off.

26:36.493 --> 26:39.411
How's a ruddy big bed like that
gonna get out of this room

26:39.496 --> 26:42.865
with those little windows?

26:42.958 --> 26:46.623
I don't know. There's a great many
things about magic that I don't know.

26:46.712 --> 26:49.333
- We'll just have to find out.
- Lovely!

26:49.423 --> 26:51.297
Just leave me out of it.

26:51.383 --> 26:53.506
I don't fancy
making a fool of myself.

26:54.428 --> 26:58.011
What's come over you lately, Charlie?
You're no fun any more.

26:58.098 --> 27:02.226
Help me tidy up. We don't want
to go to London with an unmade bed.

27:02.311 --> 27:05.016
- How old is Charles?
- Eleven, going on twelve.

27:05.105 --> 27:10.444
I see. That's what my father used
to call the age of not believing.

27:10.527 --> 27:12.485
What's that supposed to be?

27:13.614 --> 27:17.279
When you rush around
in hopeless circles

27:17.368 --> 27:21.828
Searching everywhere
for something true

27:21.914 --> 27:26.243
You're at the age of not believing

27:26.335 --> 27:29.538
When all the make-believe
is through

27:29.630 --> 27:32.002
That's Charlie to a tee.

27:32.091 --> 27:35.709
When you set aside
your childhood heroes

27:35.803 --> 27:40.180
And your dreams are lost
upon a shelf

27:40.265 --> 27:44.927
You're at the age of not believing

27:45.020 --> 27:49.481
And worst of all you doubt yourself

27:49.566 --> 27:51.144
Throw that away.

27:51.235 --> 27:55.695
You're a castaway
where no one hears you

27:55.781 --> 27:59.731
On a barren isle in a lonely sea

27:59.827 --> 28:01.404
What's that? Poetry?

28:01.495 --> 28:04.698
Where did all the happy endings go?

28:04.790 --> 28:09.084
Where can all the good times be?

28:09.169 --> 28:11.292
Everyone on the bed who's going.

28:11.380 --> 28:15.212
You must face the age
of not believing

28:15.300 --> 28:19.298
Doubting everything you ever knew

28:19.388 --> 28:20.419
The knob.

28:20.514 --> 28:25.093
Until at last you start believing

28:25.185 --> 28:30.606
There's something wonderful in you

28:31.567 --> 28:33.476
Lovely sentiment, I'm sure.

28:33.569 --> 28:35.941
- Are you ready, Paul?
- Yes, Miss Price.

28:36.030 --> 28:37.440
Repeat after me.

28:38.407 --> 28:42.903
Take us to
Professor Emelius Browne...

28:49.209 --> 28:50.241
Very good.

28:50.336 --> 28:55.163
Headmaster, Correspondence
College of Witchcraft.

29:00.846 --> 29:03.419
Of Witchcraft, London.

29:06.101 --> 29:09.933
When I say go,
tap the knob three times

29:10.022 --> 29:12.892
and turn it a quarter turn
to the left.

29:14.318 --> 29:17.070
- Left...
- That's it.

29:17.154 --> 29:20.357
We'd better hold on tight.

29:20.449 --> 29:23.236
The behaviour of the bed
is something I'm not sure of.

29:23.327 --> 29:25.996
Let me breathe a little.

29:26.080 --> 29:29.994
All right, Paul. Ready? Go.

29:30.876 --> 29:34.327
One... two... three...

30:31.770 --> 30:33.644
- Is this London?
- Course it is!

30:33.731 --> 30:37.313
- Smell that lovely sooty air.
- Marvellous, ain't it?

30:37.401 --> 30:40.271
- Charles, are you convinced?
- Not yet I ain't.

30:40.362 --> 30:42.734
I don't see no Professor Browne.

30:42.823 --> 30:45.444
Neither do I.
You children look after the bed

30:45.534 --> 30:47.740
while I make enquiries for Mr Browne.

30:50.122 --> 30:54.416
- I told you this bed wouldn't work.
- Don't start that again.

30:54.501 --> 30:59.543
It didn't work. It was supposed
to take us to Professor Browne.

31:00.466 --> 31:04.510
- "Professor Browne."
- Come on!

31:14.480 --> 31:18.477
Ladies and gentlemen,
gather round, please.

31:20.277 --> 31:23.812
Please note the name:
Professor Emelius Browne.

31:23.906 --> 31:27.322
I am here to divert, to amuse,

31:27.409 --> 31:29.616
and, yes, even to help you.

31:29.703 --> 31:33.072
- There he is!
- It is not what things are...

31:35.584 --> 31:37.577
It is what they seem to be.

31:37.670 --> 31:38.701
Is that not so?

31:39.254 --> 31:41.543
That ain't the kind
of professor I expected.

31:41.632 --> 31:45.250
I'm not sure it's the kind
Miss Price expected, either.

31:45.928 --> 31:49.261
What effect a little smoke is...

31:49.765 --> 31:51.674
with a dash of hocus-pocus

31:51.767 --> 31:53.806
and the scent of burning...

31:55.396 --> 31:58.065
and the scent
of burning sulphur in the air.

31:59.400 --> 32:02.400
And now, for my next trick,
may I draw your attention

32:02.486 --> 32:05.238
to this solid piece
of ordinary window glass,

32:05.322 --> 32:08.525
framed in an ordinary
unprepared frame.

32:08.617 --> 32:12.829
May I also draw your attention
to this perfectly ordinary steel nail.

32:12.913 --> 32:15.036
Now I shall place the framed glass

32:15.124 --> 32:17.163
in this brown, unprepared...

32:17.251 --> 32:19.374
Unprepared, mark you...

32:19.461 --> 32:21.952
Unprepared brown paper bag.

32:22.047 --> 32:26.543
I shall now attempt to drive
the steel nail through the glass

32:26.635 --> 32:29.173
without breaking the glass.

32:29.263 --> 32:31.302
"Impossible!" I hear you say.

32:31.390 --> 32:33.014
We shall see.

32:37.354 --> 32:40.225
He ain't very good,
even if he is a professor.

32:40.315 --> 32:43.020
I tell you what I'm going to do.
No, please don't go.

32:43.110 --> 32:47.238
Don't leave now
and regret lost opportunities later.

32:55.414 --> 33:00.123
You, young sir. Would you care
to warble like the storied nightingale?

33:00.210 --> 33:02.618
With this inexpensive device,

33:02.713 --> 33:06.296
you can charm the very birds
down from the trees, like so.

33:10.804 --> 33:13.378
- How much?
- For you, sir, one penny.

33:14.391 --> 33:16.598
One copper coin of the realm.

33:24.401 --> 33:27.735
Carrie, I'm very surprised
at you wandering off like this.

33:27.821 --> 33:31.321
We found him for you, miss.
We found Professor Browne.

33:31.408 --> 33:34.078
Don't work. I've been cheated!

33:34.161 --> 33:37.411
Is that Professor Browne?

33:37.498 --> 33:39.870
It is indeed, my dear.
How may I serve you?

33:39.958 --> 33:46.293
Would you be interested in the mating
call of the Brazilian bird of love?

33:47.424 --> 33:48.622
Very useful, eh?

33:48.717 --> 33:52.762
You are the headmaster of the
Emelius Browne College of Witchcraft?

33:52.846 --> 33:56.346
The late headmaster.
The college, alas, is now defunct.

33:56.433 --> 33:58.889
Professor Browne,
I am one of your pupils.

33:58.977 --> 34:03.604
My dear lady, you are indeed
an ornament to the college.

34:03.691 --> 34:05.482
- Splendid.
- Not at all.

34:05.567 --> 34:08.319
I was shocked when you
closed down the college

34:08.404 --> 34:11.274
without that most important
last lesson.

34:11.364 --> 34:14.485
I'm sorry, my dear. No refunds.
Look at your contract.

34:14.576 --> 34:17.909
But I must have the spell
that comes with the last lesson!

34:17.996 --> 34:20.203
The matter is closed.
I bid you good day.

34:20.290 --> 34:22.616
I have an appointment at my club.

34:22.710 --> 34:24.619
The matter is not closed!

34:24.712 --> 34:27.629
- Don't let him get away.
- Righto!

34:35.639 --> 34:37.964
Here we are.

34:38.058 --> 34:40.382
Will you get this child off my leg?

34:40.476 --> 34:43.051
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.

34:50.529 --> 34:53.101
Now I trust you'll behave
more like a gentleman.

34:53.866 --> 34:55.739
Look out!

34:56.784 --> 34:58.861
There goes another rabbit.

34:58.954 --> 35:00.532
What was all that about?

35:00.622 --> 35:03.576
I changed you into a rabbit
with one of your own spells.

35:04.376 --> 35:07.543
My spell? From my school?

35:07.629 --> 35:09.752
Not one of your best spells.

35:09.840 --> 35:13.043
It doesn't last.
Some of your others are much better.

35:13.135 --> 35:16.171
But I don't understand. My spell?

35:16.263 --> 35:18.671
They were just nonsense words
from an old book.

35:18.766 --> 35:20.758
They worked perfectly well for me.

35:22.728 --> 35:25.397
They work for you?

35:28.192 --> 35:31.857
Good woman! Some kind of destiny
has brought us together.

35:31.945 --> 35:34.650
You got these spells
out of some old book, you say?

35:34.740 --> 35:37.065
I changed them round a bit.

35:37.159 --> 35:40.575
I gave them a bit
of my own style, as it were.

35:40.662 --> 35:43.996
The old sorcerers did have
a bit of a tendency to waffle on.

35:44.083 --> 35:48.294
But dear lady, I never thought
I'd meet somebody like you.

35:49.463 --> 35:51.254
What a treasure.

35:51.340 --> 35:54.625
Mr Browne, will you please
stick to the point.

35:54.718 --> 35:57.340
I would like to see this book
immediately.

35:57.429 --> 35:59.920
Certainly. It's at my new town house.

36:00.015 --> 36:02.506
Would you care
to join me for luncheon?

36:02.601 --> 36:05.602
We can discuss my ideas
at the same time.

36:06.271 --> 36:09.854
Thank you. We'd be delighted.
We shall all go together.

36:09.942 --> 36:14.105
- On the bed?
- On the bed, Paul. Come along.

36:16.782 --> 36:19.736
You go round the other side.
I always travel on the left.

36:21.787 --> 36:24.278
Will you give the address
to Paul, please?

36:24.373 --> 36:27.742
May I ask how we are going
to get there on this bed? Fly?

36:27.835 --> 36:30.539
My dear Professor,
with your own travelling spell.

36:30.629 --> 36:33.298
The one you gave with the course
as a bonus.

36:33.382 --> 36:36.667
My travelling spell?
That works as well?

36:36.760 --> 36:38.967
Just give the address, please.

36:39.888 --> 36:42.095
8 Winchfield Road.

36:42.182 --> 36:45.847
Bed, take us to 8 Winchfield Road.

36:54.695 --> 36:57.150
Madam, is this vehicle safe?

36:57.239 --> 37:02.993
Perfectly. A bit theatrical, perhaps,
but then most good spells are.

37:39.031 --> 37:41.604
We're here.
I would never have believed it.

37:42.826 --> 37:46.030
You must have given us
the wrong address. Do you live here?

37:46.121 --> 37:48.826
In fact, I do.
Temporarily, at any rate.

37:48.916 --> 37:51.870
I found the front door open.
The house was deserted.

37:51.960 --> 37:54.498
Everyone has left the neighbourhood.

37:54.588 --> 37:56.913
Why should they do that?

37:57.758 --> 38:00.794
This probably has
something to do with it.

38:02.513 --> 38:04.422
Merciful heavens!

38:04.515 --> 38:07.432
You should be terrified
at the very idea of living here.

38:07.518 --> 38:10.887
You would have thought so.
I am by nature a little bit of a coward.

38:10.979 --> 38:12.687
But then I pondered.

38:12.773 --> 38:16.474
In the perverse nature of things,
this diabolical object

38:16.568 --> 38:18.775
is probably the best friend
I've ever had.

38:18.862 --> 38:22.148
It enables me, for the first time
in my life, to live like a king.

38:22.241 --> 38:24.317
Shall we go in?

38:26.620 --> 38:30.071
Rothschild '26. Noble, worldly-wise,

38:30.165 --> 38:32.739
but with a charming
touch of innocence.

38:32.835 --> 38:35.041
Mr Browne, the book. Where is it?

38:35.129 --> 38:37.086
Dear lady, you are relentless.

38:37.172 --> 38:41.466
The book is in the library. We shall
proceed there after our cheese and wine.

38:42.344 --> 38:44.752
Why do you keep the curtains closed?

38:44.847 --> 38:48.050
So that we may enjoy
the gentle glow of candle light.

38:48.142 --> 38:51.974
More likely so's a copper don't peek in
and catch you hiding out here.

38:52.062 --> 38:54.732
Why don't you
have a look round the house?

38:54.815 --> 38:57.104
- I want to chat with Miss Price.
- May we?

38:57.192 --> 38:59.814
Yes, run along.
But don't touch anything.

38:59.903 --> 39:02.940
Remember, this house
does not belong to Mr Browne.

39:03.365 --> 39:05.607
Mr Browne, where is that book?

39:05.701 --> 39:08.536
I must have that spell
on substitutiary locomotion.

39:20.341 --> 39:23.674
- What is it? A toy shop?
- No, it's a nursery.

39:23.761 --> 39:27.889
- Ain't you ever seen a nursery?
- No. And neither have you.

40:05.386 --> 40:07.129
Would you hold this, please?

40:22.027 --> 40:24.483
What do you think of that?

40:30.327 --> 40:32.996
- Well, I... don't know what to think.
- Miss Price.

40:33.080 --> 40:37.908
Think how successful I could be with
an assistant who can really do magic.

40:38.919 --> 40:43.961
Dear lady, have you ever considered
entering show business?

40:44.049 --> 40:46.125
- The what business?
- The theatre!

40:46.218 --> 40:48.507
Pantomimes, village fairs,
the seaside.

40:48.595 --> 40:51.466
Brighton, Blackpool,
follies on the prom.

40:51.557 --> 40:53.430
I have very important work to do.

40:53.517 --> 40:56.304
Listen to me. We could make a packet.

40:56.395 --> 40:58.553
Let us strike a bargain

40:58.647 --> 41:00.141
You possess a gift

41:00.232 --> 41:02.272
But I can speak the jargon

41:02.359 --> 41:04.981
That will give your gift
the needed lift

41:05.070 --> 41:07.193
You possess the know-how

41:07.281 --> 41:09.439
And I command the show-how

41:09.533 --> 41:13.531
Oh, how successful you could be

41:13.620 --> 41:15.494
With me

41:15.581 --> 41:17.953
I'm afraid we're wasting
valuable time.

41:18.042 --> 41:19.785
- What's your name?
- Miss Price.

41:19.877 --> 41:21.786
- Your first name.
- Eglantine.

41:23.547 --> 41:28.707
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh, how you'll shine

41:28.802 --> 41:33.049
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine

41:33.140 --> 41:36.889
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars

41:36.977 --> 41:40.476
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours

41:40.564 --> 41:44.431
As the shine sells the boot
and the blossoms the fruit

41:44.526 --> 41:48.441
All you need to succeed
in your plan

41:48.530 --> 41:52.777
Is the proper ally
upon whom to rely

41:52.868 --> 41:56.071
And I'm your man

41:56.580 --> 42:01.041
For I have an acumen
that's nigh-superhuman

42:01.126 --> 42:03.748
I sell things that nobody can

42:04.630 --> 42:08.841
So I humbly suggest
you accept my behest

42:08.926 --> 42:12.010
I'm your man

42:13.055 --> 42:16.554
Eglantine, Eglantine,
oh how you'll shine

42:16.642 --> 42:18.053
Will you stop?

42:18.143 --> 42:20.634
Your lot and my lot
have got to combine

42:20.729 --> 42:24.229
Eglantine, Eglantine,
hark to the stars

42:24.316 --> 42:27.519
Destiny calls us,
the future is ours

42:32.324 --> 42:34.400
What are you reading?

42:36.412 --> 42:38.120
"Isle of Naboombu."

42:38.205 --> 42:42.072
- Can't be no such place.
- There is too such a place.

42:42.167 --> 42:45.085
These pictures prove it, don't it?

42:46.213 --> 42:50.080
Bit weird, ain't it?
Animals wearing hats and things.

42:51.343 --> 42:53.170
I like it.

42:55.681 --> 42:58.717
Now where is the book?

42:58.809 --> 43:00.885
Well? Where is it?

43:18.162 --> 43:21.198
At last, Mr Browne!

43:25.127 --> 43:28.461
"The Spells of Astoroth."

43:28.547 --> 43:30.540
Of course.

43:30.632 --> 43:33.420
Here's the travelling spell.
This is where you got it.

43:35.429 --> 43:37.635
Does one's nose
have to twitch like this?

43:38.265 --> 43:40.305
Oh, you're back, Mr Browne.

43:40.392 --> 43:42.468
Miss Price,
a word about your tactics.

43:42.561 --> 43:44.969
I don't mind being changed
into a hawk or a tiger

43:45.064 --> 43:46.522
or something with dash.

43:46.607 --> 43:50.190
But always a fluffy white rabbit?
It's intolerable!

43:51.653 --> 43:55.402
Here we are!
Substitutiary locomotion.

43:56.116 --> 43:59.616
"The ancient art of..."

43:59.703 --> 44:05.409
"The spell which creates
this force is five mystic words."

44:05.501 --> 44:08.170
"These words are..."

44:13.550 --> 44:15.377
But the rest of the book is missing!

44:15.469 --> 44:17.877
Now you see why
I closed down the college.

44:19.682 --> 44:22.932
- But where are the other pages?
- Haven't the foggiest.

44:23.018 --> 44:25.936
- Listen to me!
- I'm all ears.

44:26.021 --> 44:29.604
You will be if you don't pay attention.
Where did you get this book?

44:29.692 --> 44:33.772
I bought it from a street market.
There was a bit of unpleasantness.

44:33.862 --> 44:36.650
He claimed that I'd given him
a dud coin. I ask you!

44:36.740 --> 44:39.196
There was a sort of scuffle.
The book tore.

44:39.284 --> 44:41.526
He got one half and I got the other.

44:41.620 --> 44:45.155
- But where's the other half now?
- It's probably been thrown away.

44:45.249 --> 44:48.166
But if it still exists,
there's only one place to find it.

44:48.836 --> 44:52.370
- Where is that?
- Portobello Road

44:52.464 --> 44:54.671
Portobello Road

44:54.758 --> 44:58.293
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed

44:58.387 --> 45:01.756
Anything and everything
a chap can unload

45:01.849 --> 45:05.099
Is sold off the barrow
in Portobello Road

45:05.185 --> 45:10.346
You'll find what you want
in the Portobello Road

45:12.651 --> 45:16.020
- Rare alabaster
- Genuine plaster

45:16.113 --> 45:19.446
A filigreed samovar
owned by the tsars

45:19.533 --> 45:22.949
- A pen used by Shelley
- A new Botticelli!

45:23.037 --> 45:26.821
The snippers that clipped
old King Edward's cigars

45:26.915 --> 45:30.498
Made in Hong Kong?
Two bob a dozen, would you say?

45:30.586 --> 45:33.752
- Waterford crystal
- Napoleon's pistols

45:33.839 --> 45:37.422
Society heirlooms with genuine gems

45:37.509 --> 45:41.174
Rembrandts, El Grecos,
Toulouse-Lautrecos

45:41.263 --> 45:44.762
Painted last week
on the banks of the Thames

45:45.726 --> 45:48.596
Very interesting,
but where do they sell books?

45:48.687 --> 45:50.894
There's a little place
around the corner.

45:51.690 --> 45:55.142
Portobello Road, Portobello Road

45:55.235 --> 45:58.651
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed

45:58.739 --> 46:01.942
Anything and everything
a chap can unload

46:02.034 --> 46:05.284
Is sold off the barrow
in Portobello Road

46:05.371 --> 46:10.198
You meet all your chums
in the Portobello Road

46:10.292 --> 46:12.332
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.

46:15.798 --> 46:18.467
What I want
is the other half of this book.

46:18.550 --> 46:20.590
All in good time, my dear.

46:20.678 --> 46:24.011
Burke's Peerage, The Bride Book,
The Fishmonger's Guidebook

46:24.098 --> 46:26.137
I'm looking for
the other part of this.

46:26.225 --> 46:29.142
A Victorian novel, "The Unwanted Son"

46:29.228 --> 46:32.098
- You don't understand!
- The History of Potting

46:32.189 --> 46:33.600
The Yearbook of Yachting

46:33.691 --> 46:37.439
The leather-bound
"Life of Attila the Hun"

46:37.528 --> 46:40.731
Portobello Road, Portobello Road

46:40.823 --> 46:44.405
Street where
the riches of ages are stowed

46:44.493 --> 46:47.827
Artefacts to glorify a regal abode

46:47.913 --> 46:51.329
Are hidden in the flotsam
in Portobello Road

46:51.417 --> 46:52.827
Who do you think you are?

46:52.918 --> 46:55.836
Tokens and treasures,
yesterday's pleasures

46:55.921 --> 46:59.255
Cheap imitations
and heirlooms of old

46:59.341 --> 47:02.959
Dented and tarnished,
scarred and unvarnished

47:03.053 --> 47:04.429
In old Portobello...

47:04.513 --> 47:07.218
This lady is looking
for the other half of this book.

47:07.307 --> 47:09.300
It's called "The Spells of Astoroth".

47:13.731 --> 47:16.222
I don't keep no torn
or damaged books here.

47:16.316 --> 47:19.732
What do you think I am?
A ruddy wastepaper merchant?

47:21.947 --> 47:26.027
You can eat like a king
in the Portobello Road

47:28.037 --> 47:30.824
There's another bookstore
along here somewhere.

47:30.914 --> 47:33.785
You don't expect
to sell a piano like that, do you?

47:33.876 --> 47:36.283
Let me have a go, my dear fellow.

47:37.713 --> 47:41.960
Portobello Road, Portobello Road

47:42.051 --> 47:45.217
Happy things are happening
in Portobello Road

47:45.304 --> 47:49.467
You feel like a ballerina
when you're hopping like a toad

47:49.558 --> 47:53.141
When you kick your heels up
down in Portobello Road

50:26.715 --> 50:28.174
Come on, ducks!

50:29.718 --> 50:31.378
Come on, girls!

50:42.481 --> 50:44.474
Lovely.

50:51.740 --> 50:54.065
Oh, yeah, play the drums.

52:43.686 --> 52:45.346
Closing time!

52:51.944 --> 52:53.853
Bye!

53:07.001 --> 53:10.583
Portobello Road

53:11.505 --> 53:14.459
Portobello Road

53:14.550 --> 53:21.431
Street where the riches
of ages are stowed

53:21.515 --> 53:26.640
Anything and everything
a chap can unload...

53:26.729 --> 53:30.311
Hey, governor. Something
for the lady friend? Nylons?

53:30.399 --> 53:32.308
- No, thank you.
- Petrol coupons?

53:32.401 --> 53:34.358
- Chocs for the little 'uns?
- No.

53:34.445 --> 53:37.399
How about one of these, mate?
Fell off the back of a lorry.

53:37.489 --> 53:40.989
- Be a good chap and run away.
- Would you fancy this, then?

53:42.703 --> 53:45.490
Now you have my undivided attention.

53:45.581 --> 53:48.784
- What can I do for you?
- Get over to the Bookman right away.

53:48.876 --> 53:51.545
He wants to see you. You too.

53:52.379 --> 53:55.713
Who is the Bookman? And what right
has he got to order me about?

53:55.799 --> 53:58.421
I think we'd better
ask questions later.

53:58.510 --> 54:00.218
Excuse me.

54:04.516 --> 54:07.850
Sorry, guv.
No one told me about the stairs.

54:07.936 --> 54:10.427
Why didn't you
bring Scotland Yard, Swinburne,

54:10.522 --> 54:12.598
and half the Household Cavalry
as well?

54:12.691 --> 54:14.684
What's the bed for?

54:14.777 --> 54:17.943
It's a present for you.
That's what he said.

54:18.030 --> 54:20.521
Nothing of the sort.
The bed belongs to me.

54:20.616 --> 54:22.739
Except for this knob, which is mine.

54:22.826 --> 54:26.824
Bookman, there's been bad blood
between us long enough.

54:26.914 --> 54:30.164
Let this gift begin friendship anew.

54:30.250 --> 54:33.702
- Draw the curtains. Lock the door.
- You'll be snug as a bug.

54:33.796 --> 54:37.212
Isn't that the section of the manuscript
we've been looking for?

54:37.299 --> 54:40.502
- Who is this person?
- Miss Eglantine Price.

54:40.594 --> 54:42.836
A charming young woman
of my acquaintance.

54:42.930 --> 54:46.180
Miss Price, I've been looking
for this other bit a long time.

54:46.266 --> 54:49.635
Mr Swinburne told me you were
in the market making enquiries.

54:49.728 --> 54:54.604
And here we are. I don't mind saying,
to see it all together at last...

54:54.692 --> 54:58.606
- There isn't much I wouldn't do.
- Or haven't done, for that matter.

54:58.696 --> 55:02.776
- Right, guv?
- You'll close your mouth, Swinburne.

55:02.866 --> 55:05.274
Is that clear?

55:05.369 --> 55:10.327
It's all like a jolly detective story
or jigsaw puzzle, isn't it?

55:10.416 --> 55:13.701
We're both after the same spell.

55:13.794 --> 55:16.748
You have one clue, I have the other.

55:17.297 --> 55:23.134
Yes, in that case, the sensible thing
seems to be for us to cooperate.

55:23.971 --> 55:27.340
I assume you're looking
for the same thing I am.

55:27.433 --> 55:28.761
May I?

55:30.561 --> 55:33.645
This is quite a moment
for both of us.

55:35.899 --> 55:38.355
"Substitutiary locomotion,

55:38.444 --> 55:42.691
the lost miracle of the ancients."
And so on and so forth.

55:42.781 --> 55:44.192
Here we are.

55:44.283 --> 55:48.696
"The spell which creates this force
is five mystic words."

55:48.787 --> 55:50.579
"These words are...

55:50.664 --> 55:56.667
engraved on the star that was always
worn by the sorcerer Astoroth."

55:56.754 --> 55:59.126
But where are the words of the spell?

55:59.214 --> 56:02.334
I assumed they'd be
in your half of the manuscript.

56:02.426 --> 56:05.178
I thought they'd be in yours!

56:05.262 --> 56:08.761
Once again, a dead end.

56:10.017 --> 56:12.259
I shall never know the secret.

56:14.229 --> 56:18.393
Isn't that old Astoroth?
And there's his star.

56:18.484 --> 56:20.891
Pity it's so small
you can't read the writing.

56:20.986 --> 56:23.987
- But why the animals?
- Towards the end of his life,

56:24.073 --> 56:26.149
Astoroth kept animals in cages

56:26.241 --> 56:29.527
in search for the spells that
would make them more like humans.

56:29.620 --> 56:34.080
The legend is that finally the
animals rebelled at the experiment,

56:34.166 --> 56:38.294
killed Astoroth
and stole many of his powers.

56:38.379 --> 56:41.048
Including the star
with the spell on it.

56:41.131 --> 56:44.631
Possibly.
They found a ship, sailed away

56:44.718 --> 56:46.794
and were never heard of again.

56:46.887 --> 56:50.754
However, there is a final notation
in my half of the book

56:50.849 --> 56:53.257
saying that in the 17th century

56:53.352 --> 56:56.388
a shipwrecked lascar
was taken from the sea

56:56.480 --> 57:00.264
half mad with thirst
and exposure to the sun.

57:00.359 --> 57:05.946
Before he died, he swore he had seen
an island ruled by animals.

57:06.031 --> 57:07.312
Where?

57:07.408 --> 57:12.485
There is,
I regret to say, no such island.

57:12.579 --> 57:14.952
I looked for it in every chart.

57:15.040 --> 57:18.658
The Isle of Naboombu does not exist.

57:18.752 --> 57:21.457
It does too! Got my own...

57:22.548 --> 57:24.955
- What is he trying to say?
- Nothing!

57:25.050 --> 57:28.004
When he don't say nothing,
he mumbles.

57:28.095 --> 57:30.716
I wish the child to speak!

57:31.807 --> 57:35.721
- Now you've done it.
- There is too such a place.

57:36.854 --> 57:41.017
Got my own book. There.
Real pretty letters, ain't it?

57:42.776 --> 57:45.611
- Let me see it.
- You're not interested, Bookman.

57:45.696 --> 57:48.650
- It's just a children's book.
- I'll be the judge of that.

57:48.741 --> 57:50.235
- Give it to me.
- No.

57:50.325 --> 57:53.576
Please don't annoy me.

57:53.662 --> 57:56.996
- Give me the book, boy.
- Not likely.

57:58.083 --> 58:00.870
Bit of a stalemate, isn't it?

58:05.132 --> 58:07.705
If it's all the same to you,
I'd rather use my own.

58:07.801 --> 58:10.553
Sentiment, you know.

58:10.637 --> 58:12.714
Come along, Paul. It's time to go.

58:12.806 --> 58:16.851
Go? How, my dear? The door is locked.

58:16.935 --> 58:20.221
Observe the fundamental weakness
of the criminal mind.

58:20.314 --> 58:23.481
- You will believe no one or anything.
- I understand.

58:23.567 --> 58:26.402
- The knob, Paul.
- Course you do, my dear.

58:26.487 --> 58:29.938
We can tell them the complete truth.
They will believe nothing.

58:30.741 --> 58:32.947
He's up to something, you know.

58:33.035 --> 58:37.578
Before your very eyes, I shall cause
this bed and the occupants on it

58:37.664 --> 58:39.741
to disappear.

58:39.833 --> 58:43.582
I should like to see a cheap-jack
tenth-rate entertainer

58:43.671 --> 58:45.544
do a trick like that.

58:45.631 --> 58:47.291
"Cheap-jack entertainer."

58:47.383 --> 58:49.874
- That was naughty.
- All right, Paul.

58:50.719 --> 58:52.628
- Where to?
- To the Island of Naboombu.

58:52.721 --> 58:56.055
- I'm very curious about that place.
- Good.

58:56.141 --> 58:58.811
Bed, take us
to the Island of Naboombu.

59:04.525 --> 59:07.098
Enough of this nonsense!
Get the book!

59:44.148 --> 59:46.721
Beastly climate.
I never did fancy the sea.

59:47.151 --> 59:50.354
- Where are we?
- Naboombu, of course.

59:50.446 --> 59:53.281
I've never seen
no island like this before.

59:53.365 --> 59:56.615
I'm afraid we may have
fallen into the lagoon.

59:56.702 --> 01:00:00.153
That's right.
Here we are on page three.

01:00:06.712 --> 01:00:09.713
Oi, Mr Codfish!

01:00:09.798 --> 01:00:14.341
Hello, young fellow!
Welcome to Naboombu Lagoon.

01:00:15.095 --> 01:00:18.429
Now I'm hearing things.
Fish don't talk.

01:00:19.058 --> 01:00:21.097
Not too bright, is he?

01:00:21.185 --> 01:00:24.933
- He's my brother.
- Oh? Sorry.

01:00:25.647 --> 01:00:28.317
Mr Codfish,
where is the Island of Naboombu?

01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:31.603
You mean the land part? Oh, that.

01:00:31.695 --> 01:00:34.566
Straight up. You can't miss it.

01:00:34.656 --> 01:00:36.982
None of my business, of course,

01:00:37.076 --> 01:00:40.527
but I shouldn't go there
if I were you.

01:00:40.621 --> 01:00:44.535
- Having troubles, they are.
- Troubles?

01:00:44.625 --> 01:00:47.791
He's right, you know.
A lot of trouble.

01:00:47.878 --> 01:00:50.451
Trouble or not,
we should be getting along.

01:00:50.547 --> 01:00:53.335
- I wish to see who is in charge.
- What's the rush?

01:00:53.425 --> 01:00:56.628
It's really rather splendid
down here. For you, my dear.

01:00:57.846 --> 01:00:59.305
Thank you.

01:01:06.105 --> 01:01:08.097
How pleasant...

01:01:08.190 --> 01:01:09.684
Bobbing along

01:01:09.775 --> 01:01:16.109
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea

01:01:16.824 --> 01:01:20.738
What a chance to get a better peep

01:01:20.828 --> 01:01:24.777
At the plants and creatures
of the deep

01:01:24.873 --> 01:01:28.123
We glide

01:01:28.210 --> 01:01:32.504
Far below the rolling tide

01:01:33.298 --> 01:01:36.632
Serene

01:01:36.719 --> 01:01:41.297
Through the bubbly blue and green

01:01:41.390 --> 01:01:43.928
It's lovely bobbing along

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:50.515
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea

01:01:51.567 --> 01:01:55.861
What if the octopus,
the flounder and the cod

01:01:55.946 --> 01:01:57.440
Think we're rather odd?

01:01:57.531 --> 01:02:00.069
It's fun to promenade

01:02:00.159 --> 01:02:02.614
Bobbing along, singing a song

01:02:02.703 --> 01:02:08.409
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea

01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:09.698
Look!

01:03:44.930 --> 01:03:47.765
It's lovely bobbing along

01:03:47.850 --> 01:03:54.932
Bobbing along on the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea

01:03:55.024 --> 01:03:59.187
What a chance to get a better peep

01:03:59.278 --> 01:04:03.358
At the plants
and creatures of the deep

01:04:03.449 --> 01:04:06.153
It's grand

01:04:06.243 --> 01:04:10.455
When you're dancing on the sand

01:04:11.915 --> 01:04:14.916
Each glance

01:04:15.002 --> 01:04:19.213
Bubbles over with romance

01:04:19.298 --> 01:04:22.334
It's lovely bobbing along

01:04:22.426 --> 01:04:24.964
Bobbing along through the water

01:04:25.054 --> 01:04:28.802
Where we get along swimmingly

01:04:29.767 --> 01:04:34.227
Far from the frenzy
of the frantic world above

01:04:34.313 --> 01:04:38.311
- Two beneath the blue
- Could even fall in love

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.642
Bobbing along, singing a song

01:04:40.736 --> 01:04:46.027
On the bottom
of the beautiful briny sea

01:04:47.201 --> 01:04:49.692
Bobbing along, singing a song

01:04:49.787 --> 01:04:55.659
On the bottom of the beautiful briny,
shimmery shiny

01:04:55.751 --> 01:04:59.499
Beautiful briny sea

01:05:01.507 --> 01:05:03.962
Bravo!

01:05:04.051 --> 01:05:07.467
Most exciting, most exciting.

01:05:08.847 --> 01:05:11.089
You've won the ruddy cup.

01:05:33.914 --> 01:05:36.405
Help!

01:05:48.846 --> 01:05:52.131
This time I really caught a whopper!

01:06:00.816 --> 01:06:05.145
People! Oh, no!

01:06:05.237 --> 01:06:07.111
What scurvy luck.

01:06:07.197 --> 01:06:09.985
- My goodness!
- I'll deal with this, my dear.

01:06:10.075 --> 01:06:12.993
- Don't you know that...
- Good day, captain.

01:06:13.078 --> 01:06:15.534
I used to be a bit
of a seafaring man myself.

01:06:15.622 --> 01:06:18.113
Many's the time
I've shipped out of Portsmouth.

01:06:18.208 --> 01:06:20.746
Delighted to meet a fellow mariner.

01:06:22.379 --> 01:06:24.253
Now stow it, mate.

01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:28.289
- Oh, really!
- Can't you read reading?

01:06:29.678 --> 01:06:34.470
It says... "No peopling allowed."

01:06:36.393 --> 01:06:39.430
- Ridiculous!
- Don't antagonise him, Mr Browne.

01:06:39.521 --> 01:06:44.563
That means I've got to throw you
all back. That's what to do.

01:06:44.651 --> 01:06:49.064
Wait it minute! It says here
that anybody can see the king.

01:06:49.156 --> 01:06:52.607
- And that's the law.
- Where do it say that?

01:06:52.701 --> 01:06:54.658
Here in my book.

01:06:55.996 --> 01:06:58.072
So it do.

01:07:00.376 --> 01:07:02.867
But if you people knew
what was good for you,

01:07:02.961 --> 01:07:06.544
you'd get yourselves
all throwed back.

01:07:06.632 --> 01:07:09.502
The king don't like people!

01:07:09.843 --> 01:07:14.173
Nonetheless, we must see the king
on an urgent personal matter.

01:07:14.264 --> 01:07:16.056
Please lead the way.

01:07:17.434 --> 01:07:21.302
But just don't say
I didn't warn you. See?

01:07:22.606 --> 01:07:24.765
Follow me.

01:07:48.465 --> 01:07:50.956
Get out of here!

01:07:58.559 --> 01:08:02.936
Yes. What can I do for you?

01:08:03.022 --> 01:08:06.437
I caught some people
down at the sea lagoon.

01:08:06.525 --> 01:08:09.016
They want to see the king.

01:08:09.111 --> 01:08:14.615
Really? Well, we can't be bothered
with that sort of thing now, can we?

01:08:17.286 --> 01:08:19.077
I don't know that I fancy this.

01:08:19.912 --> 01:08:22.997
His Majesty is in a frightful rage.

01:08:23.959 --> 01:08:26.627
Excuse me, sir.
As an all-round entertainer,

01:08:26.712 --> 01:08:30.330
I am considered not without talent.
Perhaps I can cheer him up.

01:08:30.424 --> 01:08:34.671
No, no. You don't understand.

01:08:34.761 --> 01:08:36.754
As everyone knows,

01:08:36.846 --> 01:08:41.723
His Majesty is
the world's greatest soccer player.

01:08:46.648 --> 01:08:49.185
But due to a technical problem,

01:08:49.276 --> 01:08:52.692
the Royal Cup match
cannot take place today.

01:08:52.779 --> 01:08:56.612
And His Majesty
had so set his heart on it!

01:08:56.700 --> 01:09:02.157
Throw these... creatures
back into the sea.

01:09:02.790 --> 01:09:04.828
Aye, aye, sir.

01:09:04.917 --> 01:09:07.372
Just a moment! I can help!

01:09:07.461 --> 01:09:11.126
Do you really think so?
I'd be most grateful.

01:09:11.215 --> 01:09:13.920
Do you know soccer?

01:09:14.009 --> 01:09:16.216
Do I know anything about soccer?

01:09:16.303 --> 01:09:19.386
Why, I was captain of Tottenham
Hotspurs for two years.

01:09:19.473 --> 01:09:21.715
Three seasons
with Manchester United...

01:09:21.809 --> 01:09:23.682
Yes, yes. You'll do.

01:09:23.769 --> 01:09:26.341
Come this way, please.

01:09:26.772 --> 01:09:29.975
Mr Browne,
are you certain you'll be all right?

01:09:35.279 --> 01:09:37.439
Now what?

01:09:37.533 --> 01:09:39.774
Not an ideal person
in many respects,

01:09:39.868 --> 01:09:42.953
but Mr Browne is a very brave man.

01:09:47.835 --> 01:09:49.377
Do you think he's done for?

01:09:55.092 --> 01:09:57.381
Do you think so?

01:10:01.724 --> 01:10:06.386
I can't tell you how
I appreciate this.

01:10:06.478 --> 01:10:10.227
For some reason
we have great difficulty

01:10:10.315 --> 01:10:14.444
finding referees round here.

01:10:14.528 --> 01:10:17.814
If there be one thing we like,

01:10:17.906 --> 01:10:22.403
it's volunteers, eh, Birdy?

01:10:25.581 --> 01:10:27.869
He's a proper king!
Look at his crown!

01:10:27.958 --> 01:10:30.710
What's he got round his neck?

01:10:31.545 --> 01:10:35.044
What a magnificent... ornament, sire.

01:10:35.132 --> 01:10:38.133
Ah, yes.

01:10:38.218 --> 01:10:42.216
Wouldn't be without it.
Been in the family for years.

01:10:42.306 --> 01:10:45.011
The Star of Astoroth!

01:10:47.394 --> 01:10:51.012
You're to sit
in His Majesty's royal box.

01:10:51.106 --> 01:10:54.807
No littering, no chewing, no fruit
or wrappers or sweets. Please.

01:11:05.204 --> 01:11:07.742
Rise, please.

01:11:09.666 --> 01:11:11.908
Loyal fans,

01:11:12.002 --> 01:11:15.252
this is official.

01:11:15.339 --> 01:11:20.760
We have a volunteer referee.

01:11:33.691 --> 01:11:37.356
Let the match begin!

01:11:39.738 --> 01:11:42.027
He's still wearing it!

01:11:42.116 --> 01:11:44.737
Right, Dirty Yellows,
let's have a clean game.

01:11:47.913 --> 01:11:50.202
Right, True Blues, best foot forward.

01:12:27.119 --> 01:12:29.325
Weird sort of game they play here.

01:13:09.828 --> 01:13:12.284
Hurry up! Get rid of it!

01:13:34.436 --> 01:13:35.895
Gracious!

01:13:36.939 --> 01:13:40.639
You're doing fine, matey.

01:13:44.947 --> 01:13:48.398
Move it around.

01:13:50.160 --> 01:13:52.034
Get on with the match!

01:14:09.430 --> 01:14:11.221
- Foul!
- They're only animals.

01:14:11.306 --> 01:14:13.976
That's no excuse for dirty football.

01:14:42.838 --> 01:14:44.961
Ref, are you blind?

01:14:45.049 --> 01:14:48.334
Be quiet, Charles!
Don't forget who the referee is!

01:15:08.864 --> 01:15:11.699
- Don't they have no rules?
- Course they do.

01:15:11.784 --> 01:15:13.776
The king makes them up
as he goes along.

01:15:58.080 --> 01:16:01.081
Poor Mr Browne.
Do you think he's all right?

01:16:02.251 --> 01:16:04.124
Well, he's moving.

01:16:04.712 --> 01:16:07.748
Steady, matey. Move it around.

01:16:15.556 --> 01:16:17.881
He almost had it then.

01:16:36.535 --> 01:16:39.240
Looks like he's done for this time.

01:16:58.140 --> 01:17:02.351
Don't just stand there! Head it in!

01:17:39.973 --> 01:17:45.348
Stop... that... ball!

01:18:20.639 --> 01:18:22.596
Goal!

01:18:23.976 --> 01:18:26.977
Game's over. I win.

01:18:32.943 --> 01:18:35.564
Let me give you a hand, matey.

01:18:35.654 --> 01:18:38.691
That's quite all right, Your Majesty.
Thank you so much.

01:18:38.782 --> 01:18:41.700
Please, let me help you
on with your robe.

01:18:41.785 --> 01:18:44.241
Why, yes. Thank you.

01:18:44.329 --> 01:18:46.951
Can't have you
catching cold, sire, can we?

01:18:47.041 --> 01:18:48.701
Why, no.

01:18:48.792 --> 01:18:51.829
Have you ever heard of something
called the gypsy switch?

01:18:51.920 --> 01:18:54.127
No, can't say that I have.

01:18:54.214 --> 01:18:56.290
Remind me to
tell you about it some time.

01:18:56.383 --> 01:18:58.839
I can't tell you when
we've had such a good time.

01:18:58.927 --> 01:19:02.593
We'll carry your memory
in our hearts for a long while.

01:19:02.681 --> 01:19:04.970
I think it's time to leave.

01:19:06.226 --> 01:19:07.970
Must you go?

01:19:08.062 --> 01:19:10.303
Must be dashing. Marvellous game.

01:19:10.397 --> 01:19:12.306
Lovely to see you. Goodbye.

01:19:16.111 --> 01:19:18.781
Friendly lot.

01:19:18.864 --> 01:19:24.203
Don't mind them visiting.
Wouldn't want them living here.

01:19:26.830 --> 01:19:29.701
- Come along, children.
- Hurry up.

01:19:35.631 --> 01:19:39.581
Stop gibbering!
What's the matter with you?

01:19:40.010 --> 01:19:42.382
Your Royal Star!

01:19:42.471 --> 01:19:45.507
They've stolen your Royal Star!

01:19:47.810 --> 01:19:50.051
Don't be ridiculous.

01:19:50.145 --> 01:19:52.352
What do you think this is?

01:19:59.738 --> 01:20:06.275
Why didn't you say so?

01:20:07.037 --> 01:20:09.789
Paul, put the knob on the bed.

01:20:12.001 --> 01:20:17.920
At last the magic words.
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.

01:20:18.007 --> 01:20:20.414
I'll keep it.
Women always lose things.

01:20:25.514 --> 01:20:27.839
- Hurry, Paul! The knob!
- It's stuck!

01:20:30.436 --> 01:20:33.769
- I suppose I'd better do something.
- Please do. Quick.

01:20:35.691 --> 01:20:37.767
Got it.

01:20:40.529 --> 01:20:42.605
Filigree, apogee, pedigree...

01:20:46.827 --> 01:20:50.362
Oh, bother. I do hate shoddy work.

01:21:16.690 --> 01:21:19.228
I shall never get used to this thing.

01:21:19.318 --> 01:21:22.105
Will you push the bed
back into place, please?

01:21:22.196 --> 01:21:24.865
I think we could all
do with a nice cup of tea.

01:21:24.948 --> 01:21:27.819
No time. I've gone to a lot
of trouble to find this spell.

01:21:27.910 --> 01:21:30.365
I'm going to try it immediately.

01:21:31.288 --> 01:21:34.787
Mr Browne, kindly let me
have your shoes, please.

01:21:36.043 --> 01:21:38.664
- Fine.
- What's the shoes for?

01:21:38.754 --> 01:21:41.921
If you'd been paying attention
I should think you'd be aware

01:21:42.007 --> 01:21:46.254
that substitutiary locomotion is the art
of causing inanimate objects

01:21:46.345 --> 01:21:49.548
to take on a life force of their own.

01:21:49.640 --> 01:21:52.594
I must have inanimate objects
to experiment with.

01:21:52.685 --> 01:21:54.476
Makes sense, don't it?

01:21:55.396 --> 01:21:58.729
Stand back, everyone.
I need plenty of room.

01:22:03.529 --> 01:22:06.565
I want you all
to be absolutely quiet.

01:22:07.449 --> 01:22:10.450
Mr Browne, you have
the Star of Astoroth, I believe.

01:22:10.536 --> 01:22:12.943
Oh, yes. It's in my nice clean hanky.

01:22:20.087 --> 01:22:21.830
It's all right, Mr Browne.

01:22:21.922 --> 01:22:24.591
I should have realised
that it would be impossible

01:22:24.675 --> 01:22:27.082
to take an object
from one world into another.

01:22:31.807 --> 01:22:35.757
If only I would have had the sense
to remember the words on that star.

01:22:35.853 --> 01:22:40.230
- I know the words.
- Don't bother her. She's thinking.

01:22:40.315 --> 01:22:43.186
Why don't you and I nip out
and get something for supper?

01:22:43.277 --> 01:22:46.610
And I might conceivably
call into the pub for a pint

01:22:46.697 --> 01:22:48.820
to steady my nerves.

01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:53.118
I do know the words, Miss Price.

01:22:53.203 --> 01:22:56.288
How can you know the words
when Miss Price doesn't?

01:22:58.667 --> 01:23:02.795
Troop movements and massing
of barges in French and Dutch ports.

01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:05.122
The prime minister
has told the nation

01:23:05.215 --> 01:23:08.086
to be on the alert for signs
of a possible invasion.

01:23:08.177 --> 01:23:10.004
That was the news.

01:23:10.095 --> 01:23:12.717
I might have been able
to do something about this.

01:23:12.806 --> 01:23:14.680
It's out of your hands now, my dear.

01:23:14.767 --> 01:23:17.684
If only I could have remembered
those words. It's maddening.

01:23:18.187 --> 01:23:20.393
Why don't someone ask me?

01:23:20.481 --> 01:23:25.190
Come off it, Paul. You can't remember
those kind of words.

01:23:25.277 --> 01:23:31.232
You mean like "Treguna mekoides
trecorum satis dee"?

01:23:35.204 --> 01:23:37.410
- How do you know that?
- Easy.

01:23:37.498 --> 01:23:40.036
Says so right here in my book.

01:23:43.671 --> 01:23:47.170
You mean it was there
in your book all the time?

01:23:47.257 --> 01:23:49.583
Yeah. But nobody ever listens to me.

01:23:51.095 --> 01:23:54.096
Treguna mekoides

01:23:54.807 --> 01:23:57.677
trecorum satis dee.

01:23:59.436 --> 01:24:01.429
Nothing happened!

01:24:03.565 --> 01:24:05.273
Am I doing something wrong?

01:24:05.359 --> 01:24:07.766
Well, it does seem
a bit old-fashioned.

01:24:07.861 --> 01:24:10.483
After all, we are
in the 20th century.

01:24:11.615 --> 01:24:14.236
- What do you suggest?
- It needs rhythm. Tempo.

01:24:14.326 --> 01:24:17.327
Music.
As I always say, do it with a flair.

01:24:17.413 --> 01:24:19.904
- Do you mind if I have a go?
- Of course not.

01:24:19.998 --> 01:24:23.948
Come along, you lot!
We need all the help we can get.

01:24:24.044 --> 01:24:28.457
Treguna mekoides trecorum satis dee.

01:24:32.678 --> 01:24:36.426
Substitutiary locomotion

01:24:36.515 --> 01:24:41.058
Mystic power that's far
beyond the wildest notion

01:24:41.145 --> 01:24:45.937
It's so weird, so feared,
yet wonderful to see

01:24:46.025 --> 01:24:49.809
Substitutiary locomotion come to me

01:24:51.655 --> 01:24:53.030
Now!

01:24:55.409 --> 01:24:59.703
Treguna mekoides

01:24:59.788 --> 01:25:03.157
trecorum satis dee.

01:25:13.427 --> 01:25:18.089
I don't want locomotiary substitution

01:25:18.182 --> 01:25:22.226
Or remote intransecory convolution

01:25:22.311 --> 01:25:26.640
Only one precise solution is the key

01:25:26.732 --> 01:25:30.730
Substitutiary locomotion it must be

01:25:57.221 --> 01:26:01.265
Substitutiary locomotion

01:26:01.350 --> 01:26:05.644
Lovely substitutiary locomotion

01:26:05.729 --> 01:26:09.941
You've made substitutiary history

01:26:10.025 --> 01:26:14.355
With treguna mekoides
and a little help from me

01:26:14.446 --> 01:26:18.942
- With treguna mekoides and...
- Trecorum satis dee

01:26:33.924 --> 01:26:36.593
Mr Browne, what is going on here?

01:26:36.677 --> 01:26:38.966
I haven't the foggiest.

01:26:39.054 --> 01:26:41.426
How do you do?

01:26:41.515 --> 01:26:42.795
Shall we?

01:26:42.891 --> 01:26:45.679
- That's my nightgown!
- Is it really, my dear?

01:26:45.769 --> 01:26:47.976
I'm not responsible
for its behaviour.

01:26:48.063 --> 01:26:50.388
Obviously not, my dear.

01:26:52.359 --> 01:26:54.850
Paul, what on earth are you doing?

01:26:54.945 --> 01:26:57.436
Having a jolly good time,
that's what.

01:26:58.115 --> 01:27:01.116
- How can we stop all this?
- Must we? It's most agreeable.

01:27:01.201 --> 01:27:02.530
But we must do something.

01:27:02.619 --> 01:27:05.110
Didn't I give you
my all-purpose cut-off spell?

01:27:05.205 --> 01:27:06.997
- Lesson number eight.
- Eight.

01:27:07.082 --> 01:27:10.368
- Yes, number eight I think it was.
- Oi! My Sunday trousers!

01:27:15.299 --> 01:27:18.169
Buzz off, old chap.
Find your own dancing partner.

01:27:31.774 --> 01:27:33.897
Be careful, Carrie! Slow down!

01:27:41.033 --> 01:27:43.820
Mr Browne, will you please
control your shoes?

01:27:43.911 --> 01:27:47.446
Dear lady, I very much fear
that we have nothing under control.

01:28:07.893 --> 01:28:09.933
Do you mind?

01:28:27.371 --> 01:28:30.822
Now, who would like some more
of my lovely sausages and mash?

01:28:30.916 --> 01:28:33.372
- No more for me, thank you.
- Carrie?

01:28:33.460 --> 01:28:35.916
I've already had two helpings.

01:28:36.005 --> 01:28:38.211
- I'm full.
- Me, too.

01:28:39.842 --> 01:28:42.214
At least somebody wants some.

01:28:46.724 --> 01:28:50.971
Cheer up, my dear. This should
be something of a celebration.

01:28:51.061 --> 01:28:54.810
I'm sorry, but there doesn't
seem to be much to celebrate.

01:28:54.898 --> 01:28:58.943
- I still haven't mastered that spell.
- Of course you have.

01:28:59.028 --> 01:29:02.278
You just need a little more practice.

01:29:02.364 --> 01:29:04.689
- Do you really think so?
- No doubt about it.

01:29:04.783 --> 01:29:07.321
Meantime, there's nothing
to liven the spirits

01:29:07.411 --> 01:29:09.949
like a little master juggling.
Right, Charlie?

01:29:10.039 --> 01:29:12.576
Go on then, guv!
Give us some juggling!

01:29:19.798 --> 01:29:24.128
Very few better than me at this.
All you need is 20 years' practice

01:29:24.219 --> 01:29:26.841
and a touch of genius.

01:29:36.732 --> 01:29:38.974
Never happened to me before.

01:29:39.068 --> 01:29:42.602
I don't usually juggle
with cats under my feet.

01:29:45.157 --> 01:29:47.031
Look! She's laughing!

01:30:05.260 --> 01:30:08.012
- Mrs Hobday. Do come in.
- I can't stop, my dear.

01:30:08.097 --> 01:30:11.051
I've just come by
to bring you the good news.

01:30:11.141 --> 01:30:14.261
Mr Bistlethwaite,
who brings the milk, you know?

01:30:14.353 --> 01:30:16.476
He's promised
to take the children in!

01:30:16.563 --> 01:30:20.478
He and his wife have got that farm.
Just the place for growing children.

01:30:20.567 --> 01:30:23.272
Put a bit of colour
back in their cheeks.

01:30:23.362 --> 01:30:26.695
Why, what's the matter?
I thought you'd be pleased.

01:30:26.782 --> 01:30:30.696
You told me yourself that you had
no time to take care of children.

01:30:32.037 --> 01:30:35.620
Circumstances have changed somewhat.

01:30:35.708 --> 01:30:38.911
We got a dad now. Mr Browne.

01:30:39.003 --> 01:30:42.952
- Paul!
- Miss Price, is this true?

01:30:43.048 --> 01:30:47.591
Of course. You do want him to stay
with us, don't you, Miss Price?

01:30:49.388 --> 01:30:52.009
I suppose
I hadn't really thought about it.

01:30:52.099 --> 01:30:55.800
What about him?
What do you say about it, Mr Browne?

01:30:57.646 --> 01:31:01.858
It's all rather sudden!
I don't quite know what to say.

01:31:02.818 --> 01:31:04.894
Then I'll leave you two
to talk it over.

01:31:04.987 --> 01:31:08.190
I'll come back in the morning!
Good night!

01:31:14.413 --> 01:31:19.039
It is true, Mr Browne. You are going
to be our father now, aren't you?

01:31:22.546 --> 01:31:26.129
We are rather rushing things,
aren't we?

01:31:27.634 --> 01:31:31.715
Perhaps Mr Browne has other things
besides you children to think about.

01:31:34.892 --> 01:31:37.893
Yes. As a matter of fact
I should have left ages ago.

01:31:37.978 --> 01:31:40.979
I must get a train
back to London tonight.

01:31:41.065 --> 01:31:43.734
It's rather an important matter.

01:31:43.817 --> 01:31:47.685
I'd like to tell you about it,
but it's a little bit hush-hush.

01:31:47.780 --> 01:31:49.404
Sort of a secret.

01:31:51.450 --> 01:31:54.700
Well... if...

01:31:54.787 --> 01:31:59.413
If I've been any sort of help to you,
I'm pleased.

01:31:59.750 --> 01:32:02.371
You've been immensely kind.
Thank you.

01:32:03.128 --> 01:32:05.798
I've enjoyed being with you.

01:32:05.881 --> 01:32:08.123
Perhaps it's been good for all of us.

01:32:08.217 --> 01:32:10.209
Will you be coming back?

01:32:10.302 --> 01:32:13.837
Some day, my dear. I certainly hope
that we shall meet again.

01:32:13.931 --> 01:32:17.514
Some day.
When all this war business is over.

01:32:18.727 --> 01:32:22.310
- I see.
- Perhaps I shall realise my dream.

01:32:22.398 --> 01:32:26.146
Eglantine and Emelius:
Illusionists extraordinary!

01:32:26.235 --> 01:32:28.642
Just think how that
will look on the poster.

01:32:29.905 --> 01:32:32.147
The children are going to miss you.

01:32:34.243 --> 01:32:36.816
- You really think they will?
- Yes.

01:32:37.454 --> 01:32:40.657
Well, I shall miss you. All of you.

01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:46.958
If I don't go now
you might never get rid of me.

01:32:49.842 --> 01:32:51.751
Goodbye, Carrie.

01:32:52.428 --> 01:32:56.377
- Must you really go?
- I think it's best for everybody.

01:32:56.473 --> 01:33:00.008
- Goodbye, Paul.
- I think you should be our father.

01:33:00.769 --> 01:33:02.263
Goodbye, Charlie.

01:33:02.354 --> 01:33:04.976
Do you want me to come down
to the station with you?

01:33:05.065 --> 01:33:10.142
No, no. You stay here
and look after everybody.

01:33:12.948 --> 01:33:16.566
- Goodbye, Miss Price.
- Goodbye, Mr Browne.

01:34:07.670 --> 01:34:11.453
- When is the next train to London?
- Lord bless ye, ain't no train.

01:34:11.548 --> 01:34:14.086
Not until milk job,
4 a.m. Tomorrow morning.

01:34:14.176 --> 01:34:17.379
- Mind if I await it here?
- Suit yourself. Good night, sir.

01:34:17.471 --> 01:34:19.677
Good night.

01:34:41.161 --> 01:34:43.450
Out you go, Cosmic.

01:34:50.921 --> 01:34:52.546
Hello?

01:35:08.731 --> 01:35:12.016
Emelius Browne, do you know
you could be warm and cosy

01:35:12.109 --> 01:35:14.481
in that house at this very moment?

01:35:14.570 --> 01:35:18.982
For once in your useless life,
you really seem to have been needed.

01:35:19.074 --> 01:35:22.028
You're a failure, Emelius Browne,

01:35:22.119 --> 01:35:24.076
and a coward.

01:35:25.456 --> 01:35:29.240
No, Fräulein, this is not
the invasion, just a little exercise.

01:35:29.335 --> 01:35:33.628
A minor raid to induce panic
and to spread a little mischief.

01:35:33.714 --> 01:35:35.920
When you English get it
through your head

01:35:36.008 --> 01:35:39.459
that the German forces can land
whenever and wherever we please,

01:35:39.553 --> 01:35:42.009
perhaps you will consider
reasonable peace.

01:35:42.097 --> 01:35:44.719
Not bloody likely!

01:35:44.808 --> 01:35:47.264
Go on, Miss Price. Do it to him.

01:35:47.353 --> 01:35:50.307
I must say, it's very tempting.

01:35:50.397 --> 01:35:54.810
Colonel, how would you feel
about being turned into a white rabbit?

01:35:57.071 --> 01:36:00.903
I said, how would you feel
about being turned into a white rabbit?

01:36:02.534 --> 01:36:04.112
Be quiet, please.

01:36:07.331 --> 01:36:09.573
Filigree, apogee, epogee...

01:36:11.418 --> 01:36:15.036
- Not again!
- Your memory, Miss Price.

01:36:17.383 --> 01:36:20.218
Would you kindly fetch my notebook
from the workroom?

01:36:20.302 --> 01:36:21.465
Righto.

01:36:26.183 --> 01:36:28.674
Silence!

01:36:29.645 --> 01:36:31.222
We have work to do.

01:36:31.313 --> 01:36:33.982
I am sorry, but I must send
all of you some place

01:36:34.066 --> 01:36:36.391
where you will no longer
be a nuisance.

01:36:47.496 --> 01:36:50.367
As the words sell the tune

01:36:50.457 --> 01:36:53.031
And the moonbeams the moon

01:36:53.127 --> 01:36:57.705
All I need to succeed in my plan

01:36:58.841 --> 01:37:04.511
Is a champion rare
with a flourish and a flair

01:37:40.966 --> 01:37:42.674
Eglantine!

01:39:11.974 --> 01:39:15.473
Where's the spell for rabbits?
The easiest of all, she said.

01:39:17.271 --> 01:39:21.185
Confound it, can't women ever learn
to file things properly?

01:39:27.239 --> 01:39:28.270
Here it is.

01:39:28.365 --> 01:39:32.149
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.
That's it.

01:39:37.458 --> 01:39:39.534
Filigree...

01:39:39.626 --> 01:39:42.960
apogee, pedigree, perigee.

01:39:50.137 --> 01:39:55.214
Come along. For once in your life,
you've got to believe in something.

01:39:55.309 --> 01:39:56.933
That's it. Good lad.

01:39:58.145 --> 01:40:02.771
Filigree, apogee, pedigree, perigee.

01:40:32.262 --> 01:40:36.260
What's the use of putting us
in that draughty castle?

01:40:36.350 --> 01:40:38.010
It's quite chilly.

01:40:38.102 --> 01:40:42.313
The colonel believes when a British
female decides to become a nuisance,

01:40:42.398 --> 01:40:45.019
she can become
the greatest nuisance in the world,

01:40:45.109 --> 01:40:47.730
and I'm inclined to agree with him.

01:40:48.404 --> 01:40:50.028
You need a lesson in manners.

01:40:50.114 --> 01:40:53.696
If I had my notebook,
I'd make certain you'd learn a few.

01:41:08.465 --> 01:41:10.422
Jumping Jehosophat! More Jerries!

01:41:22.146 --> 01:41:24.684
Take it easy, can't you?

01:41:24.773 --> 01:41:27.264
- Try holding your breath.
- I am holding it.

01:41:27.359 --> 01:41:31.060
We could strip him down
and grease him with soap.

01:41:31.155 --> 01:41:35.733
No, it's no good. We can't do it.

01:41:35.826 --> 01:41:38.743
I could have told you that
in the first place.

01:41:41.290 --> 01:41:45.453
If we can't get Paul out we'll just
have to think of something else.

01:41:45.544 --> 01:41:48.249
What about that spell
that makes things move about?

01:41:48.339 --> 01:41:51.921
- But I'd need weapons.
- How about all these things?

01:41:53.510 --> 01:41:56.180
I'm afraid they're a bit ancient.

01:41:57.514 --> 01:42:01.049
- Where did this come from?
- It's Mr Browne!

01:42:01.143 --> 01:42:04.726
He's on his way to London.

01:42:05.314 --> 01:42:06.345
Mr Browne?

01:42:08.609 --> 01:42:12.060
If you are Mr Browne,
would you get off my lap?

01:42:13.322 --> 01:42:16.276
It is Mr Browne!

01:42:17.368 --> 01:42:20.155
It is you!

01:42:20.245 --> 01:42:23.033
You didn't think
that I could do that spell, did you?

01:42:23.123 --> 01:42:26.907
I am glad to see you!
But what about all these Germans?

01:42:27.002 --> 01:42:30.336
What's wrong with
the substitutiary locomotion spell?

01:42:30.422 --> 01:42:33.257
- That ought to be useful.
- It isn't ready yet.

01:42:33.342 --> 01:42:35.963
- You saw what happened.
- We have to chance it.

01:42:36.053 --> 01:42:39.801
We can't let these so-and-sos
get away with their beastly little raid.

01:42:39.890 --> 01:42:43.010
Won't you get up off the floor?
We'll go to work.

01:43:02.079 --> 01:43:04.118
- Jolly good luck, my dear.
- Thank you.

01:43:04.206 --> 01:43:06.531
Let's hope you haven't
forgotten the spell.

01:43:06.625 --> 01:43:08.914
- Not this time.
- Found this in the castle.

01:43:09.003 --> 01:43:12.169
Probably not magic,
but it might make you feel more at home.

01:43:12.256 --> 01:43:14.877
Thank you.
That was very thoughtful of you.

01:43:14.967 --> 01:43:17.374
Let's get out of Miss Price's way.

01:43:24.435 --> 01:43:27.270
Treguna...

01:43:27.354 --> 01:43:30.557
mekoides...

01:43:30.649 --> 01:43:32.441
trecorum...

01:43:33.652 --> 01:43:37.270
satis dee.

01:43:58.469 --> 01:44:00.342
Look!

01:46:56.146 --> 01:46:58.056
Sound the advance!

01:47:02.569 --> 01:47:04.396
Just in time for the kick-off.

01:47:38.355 --> 01:47:39.897
Steady on the left.

01:47:41.483 --> 01:47:45.563
Victory for England and St George!

01:47:47.197 --> 01:47:48.989
Like a Lord Mayor's show!

01:47:49.074 --> 01:47:51.031
Pikemen, hold your distance.

01:47:51.118 --> 01:47:54.653
Treguna mekoides

01:47:54.747 --> 01:47:58.198
and trecorum satis dee

01:48:30.616 --> 01:48:32.324
Blimey!

01:49:05.484 --> 01:49:08.734
- Where's it coming from?
- Sounds like the sea road, sir.

01:49:08.821 --> 01:49:11.359
Come on, lads! After me.

01:50:46.085 --> 01:50:48.326
Good shooting, bowmen!

01:50:55.511 --> 01:50:58.714
Well caught, sir. Very good.

01:51:06.980 --> 01:51:09.187
Knock his block off! That's it!

01:51:09.274 --> 01:51:12.560
Mr Browne,
make those children take cover!

01:52:20.721 --> 01:52:24.932
Are you still there, Colonel?
I thought you'd be on your way by now.

01:52:28.312 --> 01:52:32.773
You see? Things may not
be so easy for you after all.

01:52:44.953 --> 01:52:46.745
Goodbye, Colonel!

01:53:35.462 --> 01:53:36.873
Eglantine.

01:53:38.173 --> 01:53:39.668
Dear Mr Browne.

01:53:39.758 --> 01:53:43.970
- We thought they'd damaged you.
- See? No one can hurt Miss Price.

01:53:46.015 --> 01:53:49.929
There they are, lads!
I said something was afoot!

01:53:50.019 --> 01:53:52.592
All right. Drive them into the sea.

01:53:52.688 --> 01:53:55.095
Firing positions. Both sides.

01:54:01.071 --> 01:54:03.989
All right, men. Hold your fire.

01:54:07.369 --> 01:54:09.943
I think we've taught
the Hun a lesson.

01:54:10.039 --> 01:54:13.289
He'll think twice
before coming back here again.

01:54:14.710 --> 01:54:19.586
It's tragic. All your spells,
your equipment. All gone.

01:54:19.673 --> 01:54:23.457
Still, I was able to perform
some small service first.

01:54:24.261 --> 01:54:27.796
That mean you ain't gonna
be a witch no more? Never?

01:54:27.890 --> 01:54:32.101
No, Paul. I realised some time ago
that I could never be a proper witch.

01:54:32.186 --> 01:54:36.053
Was it that first magic moment
when you laid eyes on me?

01:54:36.148 --> 01:54:40.609
No. It was the day
my poisoned dragon's liver arrived.

01:54:40.694 --> 01:54:45.273
I knew that anyone who felt the way
I did about poisoned dragon's liver

01:54:45.366 --> 01:54:48.366
had no business being a witch.

01:54:56.210 --> 01:54:59.294
- Certain you're doing the right thing?
- Well, I think so.

01:54:59.380 --> 01:55:01.835
It's much too dangerous
being a civilian.

01:55:01.924 --> 01:55:03.833
Take care of yourself, guv.

01:55:03.926 --> 01:55:07.758
I'll do that. And I'll be back
before you've grown an inch taller.

01:55:07.846 --> 01:55:11.298
- We'll be together again.
- Sounds like you have an escort.

01:55:17.398 --> 01:55:19.639
Well, here we go.

01:55:38.961 --> 01:55:41.962
- Permission to move off, sir.
- Carry on, sergeant.

01:55:44.049 --> 01:55:46.587
Parade, by the right,

01:55:46.677 --> 01:55:48.966
quick march!

01:55:59.773 --> 01:56:05.147
Suppose that's it.
We ain't gonna have no fun no more.

01:56:05.237 --> 01:56:07.479
Still got this, ain't I?

01:56:15.289 --> 01:56:19.417
Call out the navy,
call out the ranks

01:56:19.501 --> 01:56:23.879
Call out the air force,
call out the tanks

01:56:23.964 --> 01:56:27.629
From the cliffs of Dover
call up the gulls

01:56:27.718 --> 01:56:31.763
And don't forget
the loyal territorials

01:56:31.847 --> 01:56:36.805
But who's digging in here?
Who will defend

01:56:36.894 --> 01:56:41.105
Every inch of England,
no matter what they send?

01:56:41.190 --> 01:56:45.104
Who's standing firm
in our own front yard?

01:56:45.194 --> 01:56:49.143
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard,
that's who

01:56:49.239 --> 01:56:54.993
The soldiers of the Old Home Guard

01:56:55.305 --> 01:57:01.383
