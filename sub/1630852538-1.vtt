00:36.659 --> 00:38.395
Let's tell her what happened
last week.

00:38.429 --> 00:39.429
- Yeah.
- All right, listen to this.

00:39.463 --> 00:40.597
- Listen, listen, listen.
- Oh, God.

00:40.631 --> 00:42.899
So last week we had a great
idea.

00:42.932 --> 00:44.569
- Okay.
- To do a prank.

00:44.601 --> 00:45.503
- Okay.
- All right, so people

00:45.536 --> 00:47.572
were walking by, I would come
out, jump,

00:47.604 --> 00:49.806
and be like and
they would get scared, right?

00:49.840 --> 00:50.675
Oh yeah,

00:50.707 --> 00:51.908
that's real original.

00:51.942 --> 00:53.543
It's a good prank.

00:53.576 --> 00:55.679
Hey, Anna.

00:55.713 --> 00:57.548
If you have one.

00:57.581 --> 00:58.983
Seriously, Matt?

00:59.015 --> 01:00.317
- What?
- She's a kid.

01:02.518 --> 01:03.420
What?

01:03.454 --> 01:05.355
You just offer alcohol to all
children?

01:05.388 --> 01:06.623
All right, anyways.

01:06.656 --> 01:08.658
So I'm jumping out every chance
I can get

01:08.691 --> 01:09.792
to scare people, right?

01:09.826 --> 01:12.730
'Cause we're trying to get
some footage for YouTube.

01:12.763 --> 01:13.764
That's how you get paid
nowadays.

01:13.796 --> 01:15.665
What was that exhale for?

01:15.698 --> 01:16.733
What do you mean?

01:16.766 --> 01:17.567
She doesn't understand,
she doesn't understand.

01:17.600 --> 01:18.903
We're gonna be big time, all
right?

01:18.936 --> 01:19.837
- Listen.
- Listen.

01:19.870 --> 01:21.471
Have you been on YouTube
for the last like-

01:21.504 --> 01:22.539
- No because I don't
care.

01:22.572 --> 01:23.740
Well in that
case you wouldn't know

01:23.774 --> 01:26.310
because pranks are big.

01:26.343 --> 01:27.378
Moneymaker!

01:27.411 --> 01:28.379
Most people
do it in a stupid way

01:28.412 --> 01:31.015
we wanted to do it in a
way that would actually

01:31.048 --> 01:33.817
add some kind of
professionalism.

01:33.850 --> 01:36.486
Exactly.

01:36.519 --> 01:39.423
Stupid makes
money, lots of views,

01:39.456 --> 01:40.725
and that's how money is made.

01:40.757 --> 01:42.025
- The point is-
- She doesn't understand

01:42.058 --> 01:43.493
- the magic of-
- No, I don't understand.

01:43.527 --> 01:44.695
Do you guys hear that sound?

01:44.727 --> 01:45.695
Because it's like
dumb and dumber coming at you

01:45.728 --> 01:48.432
with a camera to put on
their YouTube channel.

01:48.465 --> 01:49.466
Someone moaning.

01:49.500 --> 01:50.935
- She does not understand-
- Guys!

01:50.968 --> 01:51.936
I do understand how YouTube
works!

01:51.968 --> 01:52.836
Please explain to her,
please explain to her-

01:52.870 --> 01:54.272
- Guys!

01:54.305 --> 01:55.940
There's somebody on top of the
roof.

01:57.941 --> 01:58.775
Whoa.

02:08.550 --> 02:10.655
- What the hell?
- Is he drunk?

02:10.687 --> 02:11.688
What is he saying?

02:13.389 --> 02:14.357
Hey!

02:14.390 --> 02:15.025
Why?

02:15.058 --> 02:16.093
Why would you yell?

02:16.127 --> 02:17.795
I don't know,
he's just walking around.

02:17.828 --> 02:19.864
Well now he's
looking at us.

02:19.896 --> 02:21.665
Why does that matter?

02:21.699 --> 02:22.834
It's creepy.

02:24.100 --> 02:25.836
What do you think he's doing
up there?

02:27.538 --> 02:28.539
He's high as hell.

02:29.939 --> 02:30.875
Oh!

02:30.907 --> 02:31.708
Fuck.

02:31.741 --> 02:33.443
Come on!

02:33.477 --> 02:34.778
Come on.

02:38.882 --> 02:40.284
Fuck, fuck!

02:43.920 --> 02:45.322
Oh, God.

02:46.723 --> 02:47.557
Shit, he's alive.

02:47.591 --> 02:48.459
Fuck me.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.362
Oh shit.

02:52.395 --> 02:53.063
Kill me.

02:55.498 --> 02:56.567
Just kill me.

02:57.935 --> 03:00.305
Oh,
we should not be here.

03:01.604 --> 03:02.539
I'm calling 911.

03:03.741 --> 03:04.575
It's gonna be okay.

03:04.608 --> 03:05.543
It's gonna be...

03:08.378 --> 03:10.715
Hi, um, we need an ambulance.

03:13.616 --> 03:14.718
Yeah, at the community center.

03:14.752 --> 03:15.586
She's calling the cops, all
right?

03:15.620 --> 03:16.920
They'll come, they'll take care
of it.

03:16.954 --> 03:17.822
Let's just get outta here.

03:17.854 --> 03:19.723
No we wait for the fucking
ambulance.

03:19.757 --> 03:21.359
They're gonna know
we were drinking, man.

03:21.391 --> 03:22.560
We shouldn't be here.

03:22.592 --> 03:23.426
The kid is dying.

03:23.461 --> 03:25.529
Do you think they're gonna give
a shit?

03:25.562 --> 03:26.463
Fuck, Matt.

03:30.467 --> 03:31.736
He's trying to say something.

03:33.503 --> 03:37.641
Queen of Spades, show
yourself.

03:39.042 --> 03:40.478
Hey, you guys hear that?

03:42.145 --> 03:42.946
The police are coming.

03:42.979 --> 03:44.781
We should get outta here, let's
go.

03:46.417 --> 03:47.617
Let's get outta here!

03:48.651 --> 03:49.519
Hey!

04:24.153 --> 04:27.992
What are you doing with
Katy and her friends tonight?

04:28.024 --> 04:29.659
Probably just hang out.

04:30.593 --> 04:32.062
You can stay home alone,
you know.

04:32.095 --> 04:33.765
You're old enough.

04:34.865 --> 04:37.735
Yeah, I know.

04:44.975 --> 04:45.876
You wanna talk a little more

04:45.908 --> 04:47.512
about what happened yesterday?

04:49.079 --> 04:51.449
I really wish you
wouldn't of seen that boy.

04:52.783 --> 04:53.651
I'm fine.

04:54.584 --> 04:55.752
I know you're fine.

04:56.786 --> 04:58.156
I'm trying to be your mother.

05:01.124 --> 05:02.760
Let's hang out tomorrow.

05:02.793 --> 05:03.661
I don't work.

05:07.163 --> 05:09.433
Did you hear what I said?

05:11.067 --> 05:11.935
Anna.

05:15.805 --> 05:16.673
Yeah, sure.

05:18.242 --> 05:19.143
Goodnight.

05:20.110 --> 05:20.978
Night.

05:31.021 --> 05:33.223
Be careful.

05:39.329 --> 05:42.665
Last time I waited this long
for a joint

05:42.699 --> 05:43.800
I was in the womb.

05:50.307 --> 05:51.508
Seriously?

05:51.541 --> 05:53.009
How many times do I have to
tell you not to do that to her.

05:53.043 --> 05:54.245
Sharing is caring, Katy.

05:54.278 --> 05:55.278
- Oh, my God.
- I don't want her

05:55.312 --> 05:56.146
to feel left out.

05:56.178 --> 05:57.313
She's 13.

05:57.346 --> 06:00.183
Don't take things from him
and don't tell your mother.

06:01.718 --> 06:02.720
I wouldn't anyway.

06:03.653 --> 06:04.521
Good.

06:04.555 --> 06:09.059
Katy's wearing lipstick
tonight, eh?

06:09.091 --> 06:09.759
Looks nice.

06:09.793 --> 06:11.095
You wanna borrow it?

06:11.894 --> 06:14.899
So I looked up the Queen of
Spades.

06:16.233 --> 06:20.571
It's Russian folklore,
it's like Bloody Mary.

06:20.603 --> 06:22.238
So the thing is you need a
mirror and then

06:22.271 --> 06:24.574
the Queen of Spades from a deck
of cards

06:25.809 --> 06:28.279
and you turn off all
the lights and you take

06:28.312 --> 06:30.948
the card and you place
it against the mirror

06:30.980 --> 06:33.016
and then you light a candle.

06:33.050 --> 06:37.588
You get red lipstick, and then
you draw a door on the mirror

06:37.620 --> 06:41.157
with a staircase that leads
up to it and then you say,

06:41.190 --> 06:45.028
"Queen of Spades, show
yourself" three times.

06:47.831 --> 06:49.766
And then what?

06:49.800 --> 06:51.701
And then you get a wish.

06:51.735 --> 06:55.072
That's so stupid.

06:55.105 --> 06:57.575
Okay, so you mean to tell me,
right,

06:57.608 --> 07:01.778
the kid that jumped off the
roof, that was the reason?

07:02.646 --> 07:03.681
Yeah.

07:03.713 --> 07:05.081
Who was the Queen of Spades?

07:06.182 --> 07:10.219
Well, she was this rich
Russian lady who went broke

07:10.252 --> 07:14.959
in the 1800s, and to get money
she started

07:14.992 --> 07:18.362
an orphanage and she'd take
all these kids into her mansion

07:18.394 --> 07:21.097
and she'd collect money
from the government for it.

07:21.130 --> 07:23.733
But instead of, you know, caring
for them

07:23.766 --> 07:25.937
she would kill them.

07:27.903 --> 07:30.641
That's fucked.

07:30.673 --> 07:32.976
Yeah, and then when the town
found out

07:33.009 --> 07:35.612
they all stormed her
house and they grabbed her

07:35.646 --> 07:37.146
and they pulled her out onto the
street

07:37.180 --> 07:39.983
and they brutally tortured her.

07:40.016 --> 07:44.721
They burned her with spikes
and they slit her wrists open

07:44.754 --> 07:48.158
and then they threw her into
a lake so she would drown.

07:49.892 --> 07:51.861
Hey man, that's cruel.

07:51.894 --> 07:53.663
That's actually pretty cruel.

07:53.697 --> 07:57.834
What happens if you call
her or make this wish?

07:58.701 --> 07:59.937
That's a good question.

07:59.970 --> 08:03.173
Well, the legend says
that if you call her

08:03.206 --> 08:06.310
she'll appear and she will grant
the wish if she's at peace,

08:06.343 --> 08:10.980
but if she's not then she's
gonna cut you when you sleep

08:11.014 --> 08:14.151
or she'll drown you when you're
awake.

08:14.184 --> 08:19.156
And she can haunt you
until you lose your mind.

08:21.057 --> 08:21.925
Sounds fun.

08:21.958 --> 08:23.727
I say we do it.

08:23.759 --> 08:24.427
Do what?

08:24.461 --> 08:25.362
Let's call her.

08:26.096 --> 08:26.996
- No.
- Please, can we call her

08:27.031 --> 08:30.768
just to see what happens?

08:30.800 --> 08:33.336
What, you think you're
gonna jump off the roof?

08:34.904 --> 08:36.105
Shut up.

08:36.139 --> 08:37.807
How long as she been dead?
1800s?

08:37.841 --> 08:40.043
She's long been at peace.

08:40.076 --> 08:41.378
She's snoozing.

08:41.409 --> 08:43.913
And it's almost midnight, right?

08:43.947 --> 08:44.881
What do you think?

08:46.216 --> 08:47.884
I don't know.

08:47.918 --> 08:50.354
I mean, it's up to Katy.

08:50.386 --> 08:51.854
- Come on.
- I said no,

08:51.888 --> 08:53.389
I don't wanna do this.

08:53.423 --> 08:54.892
- It's not up to you.
- Why not?

08:54.924 --> 08:57.394
Because the website says if
anybody's

08:57.427 --> 09:00.264
going to do it it has to be
the youngest one in the group.

09:00.297 --> 09:00.965
That's Anna.

09:00.998 --> 09:02.299
Says who? This website?

09:02.331 --> 09:04.000
Yes, the website.

09:04.033 --> 09:05.903
Well, that's bullshit if you
ask me.

09:05.936 --> 09:07.104
I'm not asking
you.

09:07.136 --> 09:09.105
You guys wanna summon
a fucking demon for what?

09:09.139 --> 09:10.908
For followers on YouTube?

09:10.941 --> 09:12.042
Ghosts.

09:12.076 --> 09:13.009
What's gonna happen when
she comes and haunts you?

09:13.043 --> 09:15.479
And then when you guys
end up fucking dead?

09:15.511 --> 09:16.879
I'm not gonna save you.

09:16.913 --> 09:18.783
Come on, she might be
friendly.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.951
I'm just saying it's a bad
idea.

09:21.985 --> 09:23.454
You actually believe this.

09:24.354 --> 09:25.322
Yes, you do.

09:25.355 --> 09:26.355
All right.

09:26.389 --> 09:28.792
Yeah, Anna,
you can make a wish.

09:28.825 --> 09:30.027
Come on, Anna.

09:30.059 --> 09:31.928
Don't be like Katy.

09:31.961 --> 09:34.932
Any wish you
want and it could come true.

09:34.965 --> 09:38.101
Anna, Anna, Anna.

09:38.134 --> 09:39.470
Anna, Anna, Anna.

09:55.018 --> 09:59.090
You don't have to do
this if you don't want to.

10:00.023 --> 10:01.024
I want to.

10:51.474 --> 10:54.076
Queen of Spades, show yourself.

10:54.110 --> 10:55.913
Louder.

10:57.880 --> 11:00.451
Queen of Spades, show
yourself.

11:01.884 --> 11:04.355
Queen of Spades, show yourself.

11:15.398 --> 11:17.000
Did you see her?

11:19.134 --> 11:21.004
- No.
- Just give it a second.

11:26.142 --> 11:27.011
What was that?

11:28.177 --> 11:29.346
Go see what it is.

11:29.379 --> 11:30.413
No.

11:37.653 --> 11:39.188
Fuck.

11:44.260 --> 11:45.929
Are you kidding me?

11:47.529 --> 11:48.832
Are you happy now?

11:50.332 --> 11:52.302
God, you guys are fucking
assholes.

12:38.480 --> 12:41.418
Hey.

12:47.957 --> 12:48.625
What's wrong?

12:50.293 --> 12:51.628
Bad dream.

12:51.660 --> 12:52.528
Oh.

12:53.596 --> 12:56.533
I'm sorry I wasn't here for you.

12:56.566 --> 12:57.567
It's okay.

12:58.434 --> 13:01.570
Why don't you get some
laps in the pool, hm?

13:01.604 --> 13:03.040
You have a meet coming up.

13:05.008 --> 13:06.643
Do you wanna come?

13:06.676 --> 13:08.679
I gotta get a couple of hours
of sleep

13:09.546 --> 13:11.114
and a little bit of work from my
class.

13:11.147 --> 13:12.449
We'll hang out later, yeah?

13:16.186 --> 13:17.454
Hey.

13:17.486 --> 13:19.655
You said we can hang out
today.

13:19.688 --> 13:20.557
Anna.

13:22.524 --> 13:23.593
Where are you going?

13:25.128 --> 13:26.263
To do some laps.

13:27.062 --> 13:29.231
You're obviously too busy for
me.

13:29.264 --> 13:31.268
Well, I can study while you
swim then.

13:34.504 --> 13:35.672
Don't bother.

13:35.705 --> 13:38.408
I am only doing all of this
to make our lives better.

14:20.049 --> 14:20.717
You want some?

14:26.456 --> 14:28.225
The cops called my house.

14:29.558 --> 14:30.427
About the kid?

14:33.830 --> 14:36.466
Yeah.

14:39.068 --> 14:42.238
Wanted to know what he was
doing before he jumped.

14:42.272 --> 14:44.441
If he said anything to us.

14:49.245 --> 14:50.147
What'd you say?

14:53.615 --> 14:54.451
Nothing.

15:01.791 --> 15:03.160
Hey.

15:03.192 --> 15:04.593
Katy, are you ready to go?

15:04.626 --> 15:05.495
Yeah.

15:06.361 --> 15:07.430
Matt, are you coming?

15:10.332 --> 15:11.201
Matt.

15:13.602 --> 15:15.171
I gotta do something first.

15:16.339 --> 15:17.207
What?

15:26.749 --> 15:28.085
Jesus Christ.

15:29.318 --> 15:31.087
Is your mom home
tonight?

15:31.120 --> 15:33.222
No, she's working.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.543
We gotta talk about what
happened the other night.

15:54.744 --> 15:55.778
I'm going swimming.

16:04.553 --> 16:07.289
Why aren't you talking to Seb or
Katy?

16:07.322 --> 16:10.259
'Cause Seb's not answering
his phone and Katy's out.

16:10.293 --> 16:11.427
Can we please talk?

16:15.532 --> 16:17.301
We can chat in the
elevator.

16:22.272 --> 16:24.307
I don't think that kid was a
suicide.

16:24.340 --> 16:25.341
He jumped off a building.

16:25.375 --> 16:26.576
No.

16:26.610 --> 16:30.212
I think he was trying to get
away from the Queen of Spades.

16:30.245 --> 16:31.313
Right.

16:31.346 --> 16:33.350
Listen, I was looking
into more last night, okay?

16:33.383 --> 16:34.251
And I think she might be-

16:34.283 --> 16:35.152
- Be what?

16:36.318 --> 16:37.453
She might be real.

16:38.922 --> 16:39.790
Okay.

16:41.791 --> 16:43.560
Listen, I heard noises last
night.

16:43.592 --> 16:44.894
Really?

16:44.927 --> 16:46.562
We live in an apartment
building.

16:46.596 --> 16:47.630
I hear noises every night, okay?

16:47.663 --> 16:48.497
You're not special.

16:48.530 --> 16:49.431
No, no, listen.

16:49.466 --> 16:52.369
I have a mirror across from my
bed, okay?

16:52.402 --> 16:53.704
I think I saw her.

16:58.240 --> 16:59.342
You think I'm stupid?

17:01.311 --> 17:02.345
No.

17:02.378 --> 17:03.213
No, okay?

17:03.245 --> 17:04.314
I apologize, all right?

17:04.346 --> 17:06.714
I'm sorry about what
happened last Saturday, okay,

17:06.749 --> 17:08.250
but I'm being serious now.

17:08.284 --> 17:09.819
- You're lying.
- No.

17:09.852 --> 17:10.854
No, I'm not.

17:13.756 --> 17:15.224
Then what changed?

17:18.694 --> 17:21.262
Look!

17:21.297 --> 17:22.165
Look.

17:23.432 --> 17:24.733
I've been marked, Anna.

17:32.575 --> 17:33.777
Have a good swim, Anna.

17:38.013 --> 17:40.583
Did you cut yourself to scare
me?

17:40.616 --> 17:41.917
Is Seb waiting in the change
room

17:41.951 --> 17:43.787
to like jump out at me or
something?

17:44.520 --> 17:47.857
Jokes on you, I'm already
changed.

17:49.392 --> 17:50.259
Anna.

17:52.961 --> 17:54.330
Idiot.

17:54.364 --> 17:55.231
Anna!

19:13.576 --> 19:15.345
Hey, idiot.

19:15.377 --> 19:16.479
You can stop that now.

19:18.480 --> 19:19.782
Stop!

19:36.798 --> 19:37.933
Somebody help!

19:39.102 --> 19:40.504
Please! Please!

19:42.838 --> 19:44.073
Get the defibrillator.

19:44.106 --> 19:45.741
There, get me that thing!

19:50.946 --> 19:52.748
All right, in my pant's
pocket in the change room.

19:52.781 --> 19:54.317
My cell phone, call 911.

19:55.817 --> 19:57.052
Now, Anna!

20:10.932 --> 20:13.536
Charging, stand
clear.

20:17.573 --> 20:18.875
Press flashing.

20:18.907 --> 20:20.776
Shock delivered.

20:20.809 --> 20:21.677
Charging.

20:25.047 --> 20:26.482
Press flashing.

20:26.516 --> 20:27.817
Shock delivered.

20:53.709 --> 20:54.845
Hi, sweetie.

20:59.882 --> 21:00.717
Hi.

21:00.750 --> 21:02.184
Hi.

21:02.218 --> 21:03.019
Sorry that I had to call you.

21:03.051 --> 21:05.087
That's okay, I'm glad that you
did.

21:05.121 --> 21:07.857
I was in the lobby
when the ambulance came.

21:07.890 --> 21:10.460
I told the police I was
watching Anna for you

21:10.492 --> 21:12.995
but they want you to call them
anyway.

21:13.028 --> 21:15.030
Did they leave a name or a
card?

21:15.064 --> 21:16.432
Oh, uh, yeah.

21:18.500 --> 21:19.335
I didn't want you to get in
trouble

21:19.368 --> 21:20.971
for leaving Anna alone all the
time.

21:26.174 --> 21:27.443
What happened?

21:28.911 --> 21:31.047
Matthew collapsed by the pool.

21:33.015 --> 21:34.484
He had a heart attack.

21:35.183 --> 21:36.552
A heart attack?

21:36.586 --> 21:37.453
Yeah.

21:38.855 --> 21:40.490
He's 17.

21:40.522 --> 21:41.190
I know.

21:42.057 --> 21:44.794
Anna was the one that had
to call the ambulance.

21:44.826 --> 21:46.163
I told her to get some rest.

21:50.932 --> 21:51.801
Come here.

22:07.148 --> 22:08.551
What are you doing awake?

22:15.691 --> 22:16.960
Hi.

22:16.992 --> 22:17.961
Why are you home?

22:19.127 --> 22:20.696
I came home to be with you.

22:26.935 --> 22:28.904
You know you can always call me,
right?

22:33.174 --> 22:35.110
I just don't want you to lose
your job.

22:39.949 --> 22:41.985
I'm so sorry to hear about
Matthew.

22:53.828 --> 22:54.797
We don't have to talk about it
now

22:54.829 --> 22:57.199
but when you're ready
I'm here for you, okay?

23:00.169 --> 23:01.604
I love you very very much.

23:01.636 --> 23:02.672
You know that, right?

23:08.210 --> 23:12.749
I really wanna be around more
it's just tough right now.

23:16.251 --> 23:17.119
Hey, hey.

24:39.035 --> 24:40.303
Your friend is dead.

24:40.336 --> 24:41.170
Yes.

24:41.202 --> 24:42.739
What do I do now?

24:42.771 --> 24:45.107
Did you really read my book?

24:45.141 --> 24:46.209
Yes.

24:46.241 --> 24:49.144
Did you read the part
where I said to call on her?

24:49.178 --> 24:51.881
I read that after that
we had already called her.

24:51.913 --> 24:55.684
Well now you wait till you and
the rest

24:55.718 --> 24:57.153
of your friends die.

24:58.287 --> 25:02.959
No, there's gotta be
something that we can do, right?

25:03.893 --> 25:05.662
Something we can try.

25:05.694 --> 25:08.230
I told you everything in the
book.

25:08.998 --> 25:12.235
Ultimately, the Queen
of Spades will possess

25:12.268 --> 25:14.903
the one who drew the opening

25:14.936 --> 25:17.839
and summoned her into our world.

25:17.873 --> 25:18.673
There's a way, right?

25:18.707 --> 25:19.675
There's a way that we could stop
her.

25:19.708 --> 25:21.944
You said this in your
book, you said there was

25:21.977 --> 25:23.112
a way we could stop her.

25:23.144 --> 25:24.146
It is a theory.

25:25.080 --> 25:26.115
It was too dangerous.

25:28.217 --> 25:33.223
All I can tell you is to cover
the mirrors in your house.

25:33.756 --> 25:35.758
She gains strength from them.

25:35.790 --> 25:37.025
Wait.

25:37.058 --> 25:37.926
There's...

25:40.496 --> 25:41.531
Listen, there's gotta be
something.

25:41.564 --> 25:44.200
Just give me, I don't
care how dangerous it is,

25:44.232 --> 25:45.835
we're gonna...

25:45.867 --> 25:46.935
There's something, right?

25:46.969 --> 25:49.005
Just give me something to try.

25:49.038 --> 25:54.044
I wish I could help
you but it's too late.

25:57.145 --> 25:58.013
Goodbye.

26:16.865 --> 26:17.733
Hey.

26:18.500 --> 26:19.969
Can I come in?

26:20.001 --> 26:21.503
I just wanted to thank you for
calling me

26:21.537 --> 26:23.173
and taking care of Anna.

26:24.105 --> 26:25.442
You already did last night.

26:28.544 --> 26:30.346
Is your mom home?

26:30.378 --> 26:31.814
No, she's away for work.

26:46.929 --> 26:49.399
Anna said you and the
others played a joke on her.

26:51.032 --> 26:53.535
It was the guys, I was just
there.

26:53.568 --> 26:54.436
Okay.

26:55.436 --> 26:56.305
What happened?

26:58.007 --> 27:01.009
Um, they read a story about a
woman,

27:01.042 --> 27:02.844
one of these ghosts that you
call to

27:02.877 --> 27:04.379
through the mirror or whatever.

27:07.383 --> 27:09.486
And they made Anna recite a
spell

27:10.220 --> 27:13.189
and then Matthew jumped
out at us and scared us

27:13.221 --> 27:14.124
and that was it.

27:15.191 --> 27:16.358
It was stupid.

27:16.392 --> 27:19.095
Is that why you've all been
covering up your mirrors?

27:22.964 --> 27:23.832
One sec.

27:28.269 --> 27:30.138
He answered me, that guy
that I texted you about,

27:30.172 --> 27:32.141
he's got an idea about this.

27:32.173 --> 27:34.810
Come on in.

27:36.945 --> 27:37.813
Hi.

27:38.847 --> 27:40.883
What are you talking about?

27:40.915 --> 27:42.217
Anna told her.

27:42.250 --> 27:44.554
Oh, okay.

27:44.586 --> 27:47.923
Well, he said that we have
to make her an offering.

27:47.957 --> 27:50.092
I want you to stop teasing
her.

27:50.125 --> 27:50.960
No, not Anna.

27:50.992 --> 27:53.461
The woman in the mirror.

27:53.494 --> 27:55.096
What woman?

27:55.130 --> 27:56.566
What exactly is going on here?

27:58.634 --> 28:00.804
He thinks the Queen of Spades
is real

28:02.471 --> 28:04.007
and that she killed Matthew.

28:07.509 --> 28:12.280
Matthew died, Anna is
terrified and you're continuing

28:12.314 --> 28:13.583
on with this joke?

28:13.615 --> 28:15.384
It's not a joke.

28:15.416 --> 28:16.351
It's not a joke, okay?

28:16.384 --> 28:17.953
It was a joke, but it isn't.

28:17.987 --> 28:18.955
It's not...

28:21.423 --> 28:22.525
Who is this man?

28:23.424 --> 28:24.961
His name is Smirnov.

28:24.993 --> 28:26.862
Okay, I found him online,
his son was killed

28:26.895 --> 28:29.030
by this Queen of Spades.

28:29.064 --> 28:30.466
He wrote a book about it.

28:30.499 --> 28:31.467
And?

28:31.500 --> 28:34.336
And he has theories on
how we can talk with her

28:34.369 --> 28:36.371
and how to get rid of her.

28:37.573 --> 28:38.507
Okay.

28:38.539 --> 28:39.908
This is ridiculous.

28:41.943 --> 28:43.311
You know what, I have it on
video, okay?

28:43.345 --> 28:45.914
I have the whole thing,
I have us calling this...

28:48.049 --> 28:49.518
Forget it.

28:49.550 --> 28:50.485
- I have to go to work.
- Yep.

28:50.519 --> 28:52.387
If I catch you scaring
Anna like this again

28:52.421 --> 28:54.423
I'm gonna talk with your
parents.

28:54.455 --> 28:56.358
No more ghosts.

28:56.392 --> 28:58.294
No more blankets over mirrors.

28:58.326 --> 28:59.429
This stops now.

29:03.065 --> 29:03.932
Well?

29:06.367 --> 29:07.436
- Okay.
- Sure, sure.

29:10.239 --> 29:12.475
Can you watch Anna
while I'm at work tonight?

29:14.175 --> 29:15.043
Please.

29:19.580 --> 29:20.449
Sure.

29:21.349 --> 29:22.217
Thank you.

29:46.342 --> 29:49.245
You need help with that?

29:49.278 --> 29:50.279
I don't need help.

29:51.212 --> 29:52.315
Why are you even here?

29:52.347 --> 29:53.648
Your mom asked me to stay.

29:53.682 --> 29:55.151
Well you don't have to.

29:56.218 --> 29:57.153
I'm not a child.

29:58.619 --> 29:59.621
Okay.

30:16.672 --> 30:18.207
Do you want something to eat?

30:21.276 --> 30:22.644
You're not my mother.

30:22.678 --> 30:24.614
Yeah, I know, I know.

30:25.513 --> 30:28.183
So you don't have to start
coming over all the time now.

30:28.217 --> 30:29.719
I was just worried, that's
all.

30:32.755 --> 30:34.390
That's all.

30:34.423 --> 30:36.025
Why?

30:36.057 --> 30:37.192
Because of Matthew.

30:43.798 --> 30:45.401
It was just a coincidence
that he died after-

30:45.433 --> 30:46.301
- I know.

30:47.036 --> 30:50.105
Because that woman in the
mirror crap

30:50.138 --> 30:53.108
is just a game that the boys
wanted to scare us with.

30:58.713 --> 31:03.085
Okay, well, if it was just a
joke

31:03.117 --> 31:07.189
then explain what happened to
Matthew.

31:12.094 --> 31:14.029
Who's this Russian guy?

31:14.797 --> 31:16.399
Maybe they just made him up.

31:20.501 --> 31:21.370
Really.

31:23.704 --> 31:28.711
Even if they did make him
up, it's okay to be scared.

31:32.146 --> 31:33.182
I just can't believe we're
going

31:33.214 --> 31:35.117
to Matthew's memorial tomorrow.

32:08.549 --> 32:09.418
Anna?

32:21.762 --> 32:24.199
Anna, come out, please.

33:43.878 --> 33:45.548
She's here.

34:03.397 --> 34:04.399
Please, Mom.

34:05.634 --> 34:06.468
Help.

34:06.500 --> 34:08.237
Don't go in there.

34:15.710 --> 34:17.712
Don't listen to her.

34:17.746 --> 34:18.713
It's not me.

34:18.746 --> 34:20.614
Please help me, Mom.

34:22.617 --> 34:23.485
Please.

34:24.418 --> 34:26.621
Don't listen to her, Mom.

34:27.655 --> 34:28.590
I love you.

34:42.704 --> 34:44.507
You were screaming.

34:52.614 --> 34:54.349
I had a bad dream.

35:18.940 --> 35:23.378
If you don't wanna be here it's
all right.

35:23.411 --> 35:24.779
No.

35:24.813 --> 35:26.816
It's okay, I wanna stay.

35:44.800 --> 35:45.768
Why don't you sit down?

35:45.800 --> 35:48.971
I'm just gonna take a
minute in the bathroom.

35:49.003 --> 35:49.871
Okay.

35:57.411 --> 35:58.280
Hey.

36:43.557 --> 36:44.960
You frightened me.

36:44.992 --> 36:45.860
I'm sorry.

36:51.932 --> 36:53.568
Are you okay?

37:02.476 --> 37:03.346
Miss?

37:06.581 --> 37:07.849
Are you okay?

37:15.923 --> 37:17.492
I need to show you both
something.

37:24.565 --> 37:25.567
Holy shit, Seb.

37:25.599 --> 37:26.802
Quiet, please.

37:28.103 --> 37:29.771
That's the same one Matthew
had.

37:32.440 --> 37:33.509
I'm marked.

37:41.048 --> 37:42.485
Hey, are you all okay?

37:43.418 --> 37:46.721
Yeah, just never been
to a memorial before.

37:46.755 --> 37:48.990
This wasn't a heart attack!

37:49.023 --> 37:50.958
This boy was killed.

37:50.992 --> 37:54.463
She did it to him!

37:54.496 --> 37:57.500
- She killed my son, too.
- Please, you need to go.

37:58.699 --> 38:00.501
You wait.

38:00.534 --> 38:03.739
You wait until your children are
all dead.

38:03.771 --> 38:05.141
Please, let's go now.

38:28.063 --> 38:28.931
Sebastian.

38:30.632 --> 38:32.099
The other day you said you had a
video.

38:33.902 --> 38:36.237
Queen of Spades, show
yourself.

38:36.271 --> 38:37.473
Louder.

38:38.739 --> 38:40.975
Queen of Spades, show
yourself.

38:42.710 --> 38:44.879
Queen of Spades, show yourself.

38:51.552 --> 38:52.721
What was that?

38:52.753 --> 38:54.456
Go see what it is.

38:59.927 --> 39:01.529
Are you kidding me?

39:03.797 --> 39:05.166
Are you happy now?

39:05.199 --> 39:07.668
God, you guys are fucking
assholes.

39:07.702 --> 39:09.137
What were you thinking?

39:09.170 --> 39:09.971
You should know better.

39:10.003 --> 39:12.507
I know, but look at this,
okay?

39:12.541 --> 39:15.878
I didn't see it at
first but then I watched

39:15.911 --> 39:17.613
it back in slow motion.

39:21.282 --> 39:23.150
Look at that. You see that?

39:36.998 --> 39:39.166
You didn't Photoshop this?

39:39.199 --> 39:41.169
No, I didn't Photoshop that.

39:42.603 --> 39:43.505
Honest.

39:50.644 --> 39:52.146
What is that?

39:52.179 --> 39:54.115
Why do you have that?

39:54.148 --> 39:56.585
Remember I told you
that there was this man?

40:13.168 --> 40:17.873
Okay, so we can talk
with her but we can only

40:17.905 --> 40:20.174
ask her yes or no questions.

40:20.208 --> 40:22.043
There's no way this is gonna
work.

40:27.014 --> 40:28.750
Let's just try it.

40:32.219 --> 40:37.158
So, to begin, each of us
needs to offer something

40:37.192 --> 40:38.659
that belongs to them.

40:38.693 --> 40:39.562
Why?

40:40.262 --> 40:42.965
I don't know, I'm just
doing what I was told to do.

40:56.244 --> 40:58.347
Where did you get that?

40:58.380 --> 40:59.582
Dad gave it to me.

41:07.956 --> 41:09.358
Now we call her.

41:11.126 --> 41:12.794
Queen of Sp...

41:12.827 --> 41:14.896
Sorry, we gotta say it together.

41:14.929 --> 41:17.298
Oh, you want us to hold
hands while we do it, too?

41:21.302 --> 41:25.039
Ready?

41:25.072 --> 41:26.741
Katy, ready?

41:26.775 --> 41:27.643
Sure.

41:29.744 --> 41:31.780
Queen of Spades, show
yourself.

41:33.280 --> 41:36.684
Queen of Spades, show yourself.

41:36.717 --> 41:39.687
Queen of Spades, show yourself.

41:52.067 --> 41:53.001
What now?

41:54.902 --> 41:56.904
We ask her a question.

42:01.342 --> 42:03.412
What do you want from us?

42:07.282 --> 42:10.019
You said yes or no, you idiot.

42:10.952 --> 42:13.355
Is our offering enough to
satisfy you?

42:16.291 --> 42:18.794
Can we satisfy you?

42:25.233 --> 42:28.970
Did you kill Matthew?

42:37.177 --> 42:38.913
Will you kill again?

42:51.425 --> 42:52.259
Katy?

42:52.293 --> 42:53.428
Fuck you.

42:57.431 --> 42:58.399
Me?

43:11.411 --> 43:12.313
Anna?

43:16.184 --> 43:17.185
Hey.

43:17.217 --> 43:18.920
Where's the other walkie talkie?

43:20.320 --> 43:22.324
There isn't one.

43:22.356 --> 43:24.192
What do you want with my
daughter?

43:27.228 --> 43:28.430
Hey, it's okay.

43:29.831 --> 43:31.467
Anna, it's okay, we're done.

43:33.501 --> 43:35.037
Turn it off, turn it off.

43:37.105 --> 43:38.139
It's not turning...

43:39.039 --> 43:41.342
I wanna talk with
this man you mentioned.

43:48.248 --> 43:50.151
We just mainly a few messages,

43:50.184 --> 43:51.920
he doesn't usually answer the
phone.

43:51.952 --> 43:53.221
Okay, write down his name for
me

43:53.253 --> 43:55.190
I wanna talk to him myself.

43:55.222 --> 43:56.791
And can you give me his book?

44:12.539 --> 44:13.407
Thank you.

44:16.311 --> 44:17.946
I need to go.

44:17.978 --> 44:18.646
Why?

44:18.679 --> 44:19.580
You shouldn't be alone.

44:19.614 --> 44:22.416
My mom is
expecting me home.

44:22.449 --> 44:24.051
Wait, Seb, hold on a second.

44:27.355 --> 44:28.791
Talk to you later, Katy.

44:39.266 --> 44:40.534
Hi, Marie.

44:40.568 --> 44:42.470
Something's come up at home I
don't think

44:42.503 --> 44:43.905
I can make it in tonight.

44:45.440 --> 44:47.474
No, I know I left early the
other day.

44:47.507 --> 44:48.876
My daughter's friend passed away

44:48.909 --> 44:50.378
and I needed to be here for her.

44:54.148 --> 44:55.317
Yeah, no, I understand.

44:55.349 --> 44:56.985
I'll find someone who'll be in.

44:59.954 --> 45:00.823
Bye.

45:09.998 --> 45:10.932
Hi, Jan.

45:12.000 --> 45:13.467
Could you take my shift tonight?

45:16.271 --> 45:17.139
No, I understand.

45:19.007 --> 45:20.275
Thanks anyways.

45:25.146 --> 45:26.348
Mom?

45:27.981 --> 45:29.317
Mom.

45:29.349 --> 45:30.219
Are you home?

45:53.007 --> 45:54.242
Are you working tonight?

45:55.510 --> 45:56.378
Yeah.

45:59.146 --> 46:01.548
Katy, can you stay with Anna
tonight?

46:01.581 --> 46:02.516
Or can she go to your place?

46:02.550 --> 46:03.619
Is your mom home yet?

46:06.954 --> 46:07.623
I'll just stay.

46:10.458 --> 46:12.628
I'm sorry, baby, I
didn't work last night.

46:15.730 --> 46:17.032
I can't lose my job.

46:25.306 --> 46:26.974
It's okay.

46:59.773 --> 47:04.578
Shit.

47:11.219 --> 47:12.086
Fuck.

48:58.826 --> 48:59.661
Anna?

48:59.693 --> 49:00.795
Mom.

49:00.827 --> 49:01.695
What's wrong?

49:03.164 --> 49:04.566
Sebastian's dead.

49:04.599 --> 49:05.467
What?

49:07.702 --> 49:08.670
He drowned.

49:10.438 --> 49:12.641
His mom came in and
found him in the bathtub.

49:13.773 --> 49:15.309
Anna, baby, are you okay?

49:21.581 --> 49:22.717
No, I'm not.

49:23.483 --> 49:25.586
You stay right there, I'm on
my way.

49:27.588 --> 49:29.191
I'm so scared, mommy.

49:30.525 --> 49:33.427
I love you.

49:50.510 --> 49:51.378
Anna?

49:53.481 --> 49:54.782
Oh!

49:54.815 --> 49:56.384
I should not have left you.

49:56.416 --> 49:57.918
It's okay, Mom.

49:57.952 --> 49:58.820
It's okay.

50:03.925 --> 50:05.727
Katy, are you okay?

50:05.760 --> 50:06.628
I'm fine.

50:07.628 --> 50:09.230
Thank you for being here.

50:09.262 --> 50:11.331
Yeah, well, someone had to be.

50:11.364 --> 50:12.233
Pardon me?

50:13.201 --> 50:14.434
Nothing.

50:14.467 --> 50:15.569
Stay the night.

50:15.603 --> 50:16.704
You're not my mother.

50:16.737 --> 50:18.705
You're barely home enough
to be her fucking mother.

50:18.739 --> 50:19.539
Excuse me?

50:19.572 --> 50:20.807
Do you know I've been here
with her

50:20.840 --> 50:22.676
more this month than you have?

50:22.710 --> 50:26.681
I was here after Matthew and
here I am again after Seb dies.

51:27.842 --> 51:29.443
Anna.

51:37.018 --> 51:37.885
Anna!

51:39.353 --> 51:40.021
Hey.

51:40.054 --> 51:41.489
Wake up.

51:41.521 --> 51:42.657
Anna, wake up.

52:06.813 --> 52:09.016
What are you doing?

52:09.050 --> 52:11.286
I contacted the Russian man.

52:11.318 --> 52:12.686
The one Seb was talking to.

52:23.097 --> 52:24.499
Show me your arm.

52:37.411 --> 52:38.813
Why don't we just video him?

52:40.481 --> 52:41.349
Okay.

52:49.422 --> 52:51.992
So? Any markings?

52:52.025 --> 52:52.993
No.

52:53.027 --> 52:54.628
No, she's clean.

52:54.661 --> 52:56.763
How do we get rid of her?

52:56.797 --> 52:59.567
I already told
Sebastian there is nothing

52:59.599 --> 53:01.034
you can do but wait.

53:01.068 --> 53:02.737
No, in your book you mention
that

53:02.769 --> 53:04.639
there's ways to get rid of her.

53:04.672 --> 53:06.007
It hasn't worked.

53:06.039 --> 53:07.108
We must try.

53:07.141 --> 53:10.510
Come to us or we'll come to you.

53:10.543 --> 53:11.878
I have done everything I can.

53:11.911 --> 53:14.047
Well, that's bullshit.

53:14.081 --> 53:15.383
We have to try.

53:16.550 --> 53:17.419
Please.

53:18.652 --> 53:19.521
I'm sorry.

53:20.554 --> 53:22.356
I wish I could help you.

53:24.592 --> 53:25.460
No.

53:33.032 --> 53:33.902
Come on.

53:53.420 --> 53:56.090
I shouldn't of left you with
Katy.

53:57.757 --> 53:59.559
It wasn't her fault.

53:59.592 --> 54:00.728
It was mostly the boys.

54:02.630 --> 54:06.099
I know, but if I was around
more

54:06.132 --> 54:07.701
this never would've happened.

54:13.039 --> 54:15.543
Sebastian told me you made a
wish.

54:19.179 --> 54:21.715
Yeah, was the whole point.

54:22.882 --> 54:24.518
Wanna tell me what you wished
for?

54:25.985 --> 54:26.987
No.

54:27.021 --> 54:27.989
why not?

54:28.655 --> 54:30.592
'Cause then it won't come
true.

54:34.795 --> 54:35.730
You can tell me.

54:41.668 --> 54:42.636
I wished for you.

54:44.538 --> 54:45.407
For me?

54:47.875 --> 54:48.809
To have you back.

54:50.911 --> 54:54.481
You've just been so busy
since dad left, so...

54:57.016 --> 54:58.018
I'm really trying.

55:01.789 --> 55:03.458
Why did he leave?

55:11.130 --> 55:15.769
I don't know, I think he
just stopped fighting for us.

55:31.284 --> 55:33.019
Well, I'm gonna guess someone in
this town

55:33.052 --> 55:34.087
knows where he lives.

55:38.958 --> 55:39.926
Hi.

55:39.960 --> 55:40.927
How can I help you?

55:40.960 --> 55:41.628
Yeah, I was just
wondering if by any chance

55:41.661 --> 55:44.197
you know where this man lives.

55:44.231 --> 55:45.633
Smirnov?

55:46.432 --> 55:49.202
Yeah, yeah, you go
down here a couple miles.

55:49.235 --> 55:50.971
Take the road off to your left.

55:51.005 --> 55:53.474
Watch out for that guy,
he's a bit of a wacko.

56:12.960 --> 56:16.097
Wait in the car until I know
it's safe.

56:16.130 --> 56:17.097
What if it isn't?

56:22.835 --> 56:26.139
Take this just in case.

57:37.744 --> 57:38.612
Hello?

57:43.282 --> 57:44.152
Smirnov?

57:51.891 --> 57:52.759
Hello?

58:04.905 --> 58:06.975
Anna.

58:33.434 --> 58:34.302
Smirnov?

58:43.043 --> 58:44.111
I thought you were someone
else.

58:48.181 --> 58:49.282
Are you okay?

58:49.315 --> 58:51.018
What did you do?

58:51.050 --> 58:52.686
I thought he was hurting you.

58:55.255 --> 58:56.056
Is that her?

58:56.088 --> 58:57.858
I'm so sorry she tased
you.

59:00.893 --> 59:02.229
I've had worse.

59:06.766 --> 59:07.801
You want tea?

59:17.945 --> 59:18.880
That's Lola.

59:24.518 --> 59:25.186
What's this?

59:25.219 --> 59:26.987
You want to know who she is.

59:28.789 --> 59:31.259
The lady in the black
dress was first mentioned

59:32.760 --> 59:35.196
at the beginning of the 20th
century.

59:37.197 --> 59:40.134
Due to her black dress the
children

59:40.166 --> 59:43.036
called her the Queen of Spades.

59:43.070 --> 59:44.872
This happened later.

59:44.905 --> 59:49.977
1964 three teenagers
died in this summer camp.

59:50.010 --> 59:52.113
The surviving children
tell the authorities

59:52.146 --> 59:55.783
that they encountered
a ghost in the mirror

59:55.815 --> 59:58.852
when they recited an
incantation.

59:58.885 --> 01:00:01.956
Then the months, one by one,
they reported

01:00:01.989 --> 01:00:05.358
a cut in their arms by a ghost.

01:00:07.059 --> 01:00:08.295
And then they all died.

01:00:11.431 --> 01:00:16.302
1984, two 15-year-old
girls commit suicide.

01:00:16.335 --> 01:00:20.440
A letter explains that
it's to save her family

01:00:20.474 --> 01:00:23.144
and themselves from
the lady in the mirror.

01:00:24.110 --> 01:00:29.382
Uh, 1988, a boy jumps
from a building crane

01:00:29.416 --> 01:00:33.454
after telling his parents
that a woman in his mirror

01:00:33.487 --> 01:00:34.889
was trying to kill him.

01:00:36.322 --> 01:00:38.858
These stories, they go on and
on.

01:00:38.891 --> 01:00:40.960
But that's what they are.

01:00:40.994 --> 01:00:41.929
Stories.

01:00:45.498 --> 01:00:47.300
Even crazy stories can be
true.

01:00:49.570 --> 01:00:51.172
Coincidence.

01:00:51.204 --> 01:00:52.873
There has to be an explanation.

01:00:52.905 --> 01:00:54.208
It's right in front of you.

01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:55.175
This is crazy.

01:00:55.208 --> 01:00:57.377
She's not the only
one, there are stories

01:00:57.411 --> 01:00:59.046
like this all around the world.

01:00:59.746 --> 01:01:01.382
Why are you collecting these?

01:01:02.583 --> 01:01:04.050
Why do you know so much?

01:01:09.489 --> 01:01:12.894
These kids, they're not
just another headline.

01:01:14.494 --> 01:01:16.063
Why are you here?

01:01:16.096 --> 01:01:18.065
Because I'm trying to save my
daughter.

01:01:18.097 --> 01:01:19.500
You have to help us.

01:01:21.001 --> 01:01:23.137
There's nothing I
can do to save you now.

01:01:24.070 --> 01:01:24.904
I'm sorry!

01:01:28.641 --> 01:01:29.910
Anna, Anna!

01:01:33.547 --> 01:01:34.815
Are you okay?

01:01:38.619 --> 01:01:40.588
I cannot escape this.

01:01:40.621 --> 01:01:41.489
We must go.

01:02:37.677 --> 01:02:38.645
Anna?

01:02:38.679 --> 01:02:39.614
What's the matter?

01:02:40.614 --> 01:02:41.447
What's happening?

01:02:41.481 --> 01:02:42.350
Anna.

01:02:44.050 --> 01:02:44.951
- Hold her.
- What's happening?

01:02:44.985 --> 01:02:45.920
Hold her.

01:02:48.454 --> 01:02:50.056
Calm down.

01:02:54.094 --> 01:02:55.229
She needs to rest.

01:02:57.030 --> 01:02:58.032
Come here.

01:04:36.228 --> 01:04:37.497
This ring is cursed.

01:04:38.231 --> 01:04:41.134
The demon is using it to cling
to Anna.

01:04:42.702 --> 01:04:46.273
Now, canaries can sense
the smallest vibrations.

01:04:52.478 --> 01:04:54.114
She only understands Russian.

01:04:55.782 --> 01:04:59.586
Any reflective surfaces
makes her stronger.

01:05:02.822 --> 01:05:06.393
Photos, light quantum
reflected in the mirror

01:05:06.425 --> 01:05:08.494
makes her more powerful.

01:05:08.527 --> 01:05:11.598
Especially new ones like
this one made of aluminum

01:05:12.565 --> 01:05:13.833
instead of silver.

01:05:16.635 --> 01:05:18.105
What are you doing?

01:05:21.775 --> 01:05:26.180
Silver highlights on on film,
this film,

01:05:26.213 --> 01:05:29.483
capture more of the
electromagnetic spectrum.

01:05:29.516 --> 01:05:31.751
Digital cameras can't see them
as well.

01:05:35.222 --> 01:05:36.457
What does all this mean?

01:05:39.525 --> 01:05:42.462
There are more things in
this world than we can see.

01:05:54.141 --> 01:05:55.242
Don't!

01:05:55.275 --> 01:05:56.443
Don't cover it.

01:05:56.476 --> 01:05:57.811
Let her come out.

01:06:00.179 --> 01:06:00.847
Yes, good.

01:06:03.315 --> 01:06:04.184
Anna.

01:06:07.253 --> 01:06:08.588
She's here.

01:06:08.621 --> 01:06:12.092
Where?

01:06:15.295 --> 01:06:16.163
Help her!

01:06:17.197 --> 01:06:18.432
Look at me.

01:06:18.465 --> 01:06:19.700
Cover the mirror now!

01:06:29.242 --> 01:06:32.880
Oh!

01:06:42.255 --> 01:06:44.258
Who the fuck are you?

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:45.592
Excuse me.

01:06:45.625 --> 01:06:47.161
Anna?

01:06:47.193 --> 01:06:48.528
Anna?

01:06:58.938 --> 01:07:03.376
How do you know so
much about all of this?

01:07:03.409 --> 01:07:06.913
My son told me about
the Queen of Spades.

01:07:06.947 --> 01:07:09.884
He said she came out of the
mirror.

01:07:11.518 --> 01:07:12.619
I didn't believe him.

01:07:14.286 --> 01:07:16.789
I thought he's just making
this up to get attentiOn.

01:07:17.791 --> 01:07:20.594
I was busy at work, I was a GP

01:07:20.626 --> 01:07:22.829
at the local hospital back then.

01:07:27.333 --> 01:07:29.936
He started behaving erratically.

01:07:31.271 --> 01:07:34.508
He would throw fits and cut
himself.

01:07:35.942 --> 01:07:38.711
I took him to a behavior
specialist,

01:07:38.744 --> 01:07:41.347
they diagnosed him with
schizophrenia.

01:07:44.416 --> 01:07:47.353
And by the time I knew they were
wrong

01:07:50.389 --> 01:07:51.658
it was too late.

01:07:52.692 --> 01:07:53.894
I'm so sorry.

01:07:55.862 --> 01:07:57.197
I can't imagine.

01:07:59.431 --> 01:08:03.570
No, I guess I'm beginning to
understand.

01:08:13.445 --> 01:08:15.281
There she is.

01:08:22.389 --> 01:08:23.390
That can't be.

01:08:29.895 --> 01:08:31.398
I need to make it stop.

01:08:35.502 --> 01:08:36.604
I want it to stop.

01:08:43.443 --> 01:08:46.912
Now do it exactly like
I did it the last time

01:08:48.346 --> 01:08:51.252
and let her come out to you.

01:08:52.452 --> 01:08:55.322
You need to return the ring.

01:08:57.890 --> 01:08:58.759
How?

01:08:59.792 --> 01:09:02.295
There is not a specific way.

01:09:02.328 --> 01:09:04.529
You'll know when it feels right.

01:09:04.564 --> 01:09:05.698
The ring is a symbol.

01:09:06.432 --> 01:09:09.837
You should set your minds
free from the Queen of Spades.

01:09:10.569 --> 01:09:13.372
Send back the fear she imposes
on you.

01:09:16.876 --> 01:09:19.046
Do it exactly like the last
time.

01:09:32.625 --> 01:09:33.493
Ready?

01:10:23.143 --> 01:10:24.011
Say it.

01:10:27.546 --> 01:10:29.716
Queen of Spades, show
yourself.

01:10:33.520 --> 01:10:34.388
Go on.

01:10:38.123 --> 01:10:39.992
Queen of Spades, show
yourself.

01:10:41.860 --> 01:10:45.965
Queen of Spades, show yourself.

01:11:06.019 --> 01:11:07.554
Now what?

01:11:07.587 --> 01:11:08.455
Wait.

01:11:15.028 --> 01:11:16.063
Did we do it wrong?

01:11:18.163 --> 01:11:19.032
I see her.

01:11:20.199 --> 01:11:21.934
The bird would have sensed
her.

01:11:26.840 --> 01:11:27.775
She's coming.

01:11:27.807 --> 01:11:30.210
The bird would go
crazy if she were here.

01:11:32.712 --> 01:11:34.014
Shit.

01:11:38.717 --> 01:11:39.586
Anna.

01:11:40.653 --> 01:11:41.521
Anna.

01:11:41.554 --> 01:11:42.756
No, not yet!

01:11:42.788 --> 01:11:43.456
Anna.

01:11:43.489 --> 01:11:46.193
They have to do it themselves.

01:11:50.829 --> 01:11:53.434
Help them for Christ's sake.

01:11:55.134 --> 01:11:57.002
No.

01:11:57.036 --> 01:11:57.904
Anna!

01:12:08.981 --> 01:12:11.251
Anna, can you hear me?

01:12:11.283 --> 01:12:12.719
Give her back the ring.

01:12:14.654 --> 01:12:15.856
Anna, the ring!

01:12:18.725 --> 01:12:19.993
Come on, baby.

01:12:29.135 --> 01:12:30.070
Anna, baby.

01:13:08.740 --> 01:13:09.743
Thank you.

01:13:16.315 --> 01:13:18.050
You really think she'll be
okay?

01:13:23.323 --> 01:13:24.891
She should be fine.

01:13:24.923 --> 01:13:25.926
The ring is gone.

01:13:29.028 --> 01:13:30.664
All this from saying words?

01:13:31.797 --> 01:13:32.666
Words.

01:13:34.199 --> 01:13:35.234
Words have power.

01:13:37.636 --> 01:13:40.739
Not individually, but some words
shouldn't

01:13:40.773 --> 01:13:42.309
be said in front of a mirror.

01:13:45.979 --> 01:13:47.847
Something just doesn't feel
right.

01:13:53.286 --> 01:13:55.087
Take a deep breath.

01:14:08.266 --> 01:14:09.735
How do you feel?

01:14:17.042 --> 01:14:17.911
She's gone.

01:14:22.782 --> 01:14:23.984
Are you sure?

01:14:44.237 --> 01:14:45.471
I'll be right back.

01:14:45.505 --> 01:14:48.141
I'm going to help Mr. Smirnov
load this stuff into the car.

01:14:52.211 --> 01:14:53.079
Thank you.

01:15:01.953 --> 01:15:02.822
Bye.

01:15:05.824 --> 01:15:06.693
Come on.

01:15:23.275 --> 01:15:24.109
What?

01:15:24.144 --> 01:15:26.012
How can you stare into that
thing?

01:15:28.948 --> 01:15:30.784
It's fine now, see?

01:15:34.020 --> 01:15:35.722
How's your arm?

01:15:35.755 --> 01:15:37.923
Uh, it's getting better I
think.

01:15:40.726 --> 01:15:42.327
I hope your mom comes home
and cooks us something

01:15:42.360 --> 01:15:44.764
because this breakfast
I made tastes like shit.

01:15:44.796 --> 01:15:46.832
It's not that bad.

01:15:46.865 --> 01:15:47.801
It's pretty bad.

01:15:54.407 --> 01:15:55.775
Anna?

01:15:55.807 --> 01:15:57.077
Anna, are you okay?

01:15:58.744 --> 01:15:59.412
Look at me.

01:16:01.213 --> 01:16:02.082
You're right.

01:16:03.048 --> 01:16:04.951
It does taste like shit.

01:16:04.984 --> 01:16:06.286
I'm gonna use the bathroom.

01:16:06.319 --> 01:16:07.187
Fine.

01:16:56.301 --> 01:16:59.072
You really think it's over?

01:16:59.104 --> 01:16:59.972
Yes.

01:17:01.841 --> 01:17:02.509
For you.

01:17:03.408 --> 01:17:04.277
You're lucky.

01:17:15.054 --> 01:17:15.989
You okay?

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.296
Anna, it's not funny anymore.

01:17:29.467 --> 01:17:30.336
Stop it.

01:17:44.317 --> 01:17:45.819
No!

01:17:45.851 --> 01:17:46.886
Please, Anna!

01:17:50.389 --> 01:17:51.324
No, please!

01:17:55.493 --> 01:17:56.362
Please.

01:18:05.872 --> 01:18:07.539
I can't thank you enough.

01:18:12.578 --> 01:18:13.546
Katy?

01:18:13.578 --> 01:18:15.081
Mary.

01:18:15.113 --> 01:18:16.115
Please help.

01:18:22.488 --> 01:18:23.957
Help.

01:18:38.938 --> 01:18:39.572
Anna, please.

01:18:39.605 --> 01:18:42.242
Anna, please don't do this.

01:19:09.435 --> 01:19:10.403
Anna!

01:19:10.435 --> 01:19:11.304
Anna!

01:19:14.273 --> 01:19:15.108
Anna?

01:19:16.007 --> 01:19:16.876
Anna.

01:19:19.511 --> 01:19:20.980
Hold her down!

01:19:22.347 --> 01:19:23.582
Anna!

01:19:23.615 --> 01:19:25.184
Don't let him hurt me!

01:19:25.216 --> 01:19:26.351
We need to call an ambulance!

01:19:26.385 --> 01:19:27.220
No!

01:19:27.252 --> 01:19:28.320
No hospital!

01:19:28.354 --> 01:19:29.289
We have no time!

01:19:29.322 --> 01:19:30.257
No, Mama!

01:19:31.623 --> 01:19:32.457
Mama!

01:19:32.490 --> 01:19:33.926
Mama!

01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:34.627
Mama.

01:19:35.295 --> 01:19:36.930
Please, mommy, please, mommy.

01:19:36.962 --> 01:19:40.699
Don't let him hurt me!

01:19:44.636 --> 01:19:45.971
We need to do something!

01:19:46.005 --> 01:19:48.341
Put the needle in her!

01:19:48.373 --> 01:19:50.009
What is it?

01:19:50.042 --> 01:19:52.045
It's a sedative!

01:19:52.078 --> 01:19:53.012
Put it in her arm!

01:19:53.045 --> 01:19:53.680
I can't.

01:19:53.712 --> 01:19:54.546
Hold her!

01:19:54.579 --> 01:19:56.015
Give it to me!

01:19:56.047 --> 01:19:56.916
Mama!

01:19:57.984 --> 01:19:58.652
No!

01:20:00.152 --> 01:20:01.020
No.

01:20:04.055 --> 01:20:05.424
- I'm calling an ambulance.
- No!

01:20:05.457 --> 01:20:06.592
We need to get her to a
hospital.

01:20:06.626 --> 01:20:09.429
Don't mistake her symptoms
for an epileptic seizure.

01:20:09.462 --> 01:20:10.330
You don't know that.

01:20:10.363 --> 01:20:12.265
You have to trust me.

01:20:12.297 --> 01:20:13.398
But...

01:20:13.431 --> 01:20:14.532
- Listen!
- What?

01:20:14.567 --> 01:20:18.471
There's no medical procedure
for demonic possession.

01:20:18.503 --> 01:20:19.572
She'll go there and they'll prod
her

01:20:19.604 --> 01:20:22.574
and they give her drugs
and commit her to an asylum

01:20:22.608 --> 01:20:23.676
and she will die.

01:20:23.708 --> 01:20:25.577
- But-
- Do you trust me?

01:20:25.610 --> 01:20:27.145
Do you trust me?

01:20:27.179 --> 01:20:30.016
Do you trust me!

01:20:30.048 --> 01:20:30.716
Okay.

01:20:31.684 --> 01:20:32.686
I trust you.

01:20:33.618 --> 01:20:35.320
But just save my daughter.

01:20:35.354 --> 01:20:36.622
Yes.

01:20:36.654 --> 01:20:37.489
Just save my daughter.

01:20:37.523 --> 01:20:38.458
I will try.

01:20:40.025 --> 01:20:41.094
We will try.

01:20:54.606 --> 01:20:59.612
Put the cat in the cage
beside her, all right?

01:21:01.046 --> 01:21:03.048
I need your help.

01:21:22.100 --> 01:21:24.136
You think that man will help
you?

01:21:24.170 --> 01:21:25.505
Anna?

01:21:25.537 --> 01:21:27.239
Couldn't take care of daddy,

01:21:27.273 --> 01:21:29.342
you couldn't even take care of
me.

01:21:29.375 --> 01:21:32.744
The only reason she's inside
of me is because of you

01:21:32.778 --> 01:21:34.680
left me all alone.

01:21:34.712 --> 01:21:37.349
Anna, please stop.

01:21:46.125 --> 01:21:49.229
Untie me and tell that asshole
to leave.

01:21:50.829 --> 01:21:52.265
He's trying to help us.

01:21:53.164 --> 01:21:54.567
He's trying to hurt me.

01:21:54.600 --> 01:21:57.203
He's an asshole who let his own
son die.

01:21:57.235 --> 01:21:58.837
What can he do for you?

01:21:58.871 --> 01:22:01.673
Anna, you have to fight her.

01:22:01.707 --> 01:22:03.409
I know you're in there.

01:22:03.442 --> 01:22:05.578
We'll have to put
her under.

01:22:05.610 --> 01:22:06.813
Come and try!

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:10.215
He's lying to you!

01:22:10.248 --> 01:22:13.086
There's no such thing as
the lady in the mirror.

01:22:13.118 --> 01:22:14.487
I made it all up.

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.521
Stop!

01:22:15.554 --> 01:22:17.157
We don't have time for this.

01:22:18.556 --> 01:22:20.460
What are you gonna do?

01:22:20.493 --> 01:22:21.561
He wants to kill me.

01:22:21.594 --> 01:22:22.862
We can't debate this any
longer.

01:22:22.895 --> 01:22:25.432
If you want to save your
daughter it must be now.

01:22:26.431 --> 01:22:28.867
Anna?

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:30.435
Anna, baby.

01:22:32.570 --> 01:22:34.239
- Anna, it's okay.
- Don't talk to her!

01:22:34.273 --> 01:22:35.641
It's not her.

01:22:35.673 --> 01:22:37.210
Mama, save me, please. Mom.

01:22:39.612 --> 01:22:40.746
He's hurting me.

01:22:40.779 --> 01:22:42.849
I'll inject her with a lethal
dosage

01:22:42.881 --> 01:22:44.649
of sodium pentathol.

01:22:44.682 --> 01:22:48.320
It will result in cardiac
arrest and clinical death.

01:22:48.354 --> 01:22:49.422
What?

01:22:49.454 --> 01:22:51.157
Kill her? Are you fucking crazy?

01:22:51.189 --> 01:22:53.458
He's lying to you, Mom!

01:22:53.492 --> 01:22:54.860
He's lying!

01:22:54.894 --> 01:22:55.862
No, you can't do this.

01:22:55.895 --> 01:22:58.565
If I don't do it you
will lose your daughter.

01:22:59.698 --> 01:23:02.201
While she's dead the Queen of
Spades

01:23:02.234 --> 01:23:03.903
has to come out of Anna.

01:23:03.935 --> 01:23:05.604
Then I will revive her.

01:23:05.637 --> 01:23:07.172
He wants to kill me,
Mom.

01:23:07.206 --> 01:23:07.840
No.

01:23:07.872 --> 01:23:08.807
It's our only chance!

01:23:08.841 --> 01:23:10.576
It's crazy, there has to be
another way.

01:23:10.609 --> 01:23:12.245
My son had the same thing.

01:23:12.278 --> 01:23:15.213
- And he's dead!
- She killed him

01:23:15.247 --> 01:23:16.649
because I was too late!

01:23:16.681 --> 01:23:18.650
Because I waited too long!

01:23:18.684 --> 01:23:21.387
But I will not let that happen
this time!

01:23:21.420 --> 01:23:22.822
We must do this! Now!

01:23:24.222 --> 01:23:25.690
Don't trust him.

01:23:25.724 --> 01:23:26.592
No.

01:23:28.226 --> 01:23:31.430
You know in your heart that
I'm right.

01:23:31.462 --> 01:23:32.931
You said you trusted me.

01:23:32.965 --> 01:23:35.635
I'm only here to save your
daughter!

01:23:35.667 --> 01:23:36.802
Mom, please.

01:23:37.670 --> 01:23:38.503
No.

01:23:38.537 --> 01:23:40.206
It's me, Mom, it's me.

01:23:40.238 --> 01:23:41.673
Please, Mom.

01:23:41.707 --> 01:23:44.310
You have to make the choice.

01:23:47.378 --> 01:23:48.213
Do it.

01:23:48.247 --> 01:23:48.914
No, Mom!

01:23:50.416 --> 01:23:51.284
No!

01:23:52.650 --> 01:23:53.519
Mom!

01:23:54.485 --> 01:23:55.787
Mom, it's me!

01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:57.323
You can't!

01:23:57.355 --> 01:23:59.192
- Mom!
- We have to do this now.

01:23:59.225 --> 01:24:00.860
The Queen of Spades, she will
latch on

01:24:00.893 --> 01:24:03.229
to the first soul that she can
find.

01:24:03.261 --> 01:24:04.462
This cat.

01:24:04.496 --> 01:24:05.530
We need to move back.

01:24:05.564 --> 01:24:08.267
How do you know she
won't get into one of us?

01:24:08.300 --> 01:24:09.202
I don't know!

01:24:09.234 --> 01:24:09.902
No, Mom!

01:24:11.502 --> 01:24:14.907
After 60 seconds I will
perform CPR.

01:24:14.939 --> 01:24:17.777
The cat will look like it's
disturbed,

01:24:17.810 --> 01:24:20.680
but under no circumstances
will you let it out.

01:24:20.712 --> 01:24:23.949
After three minutes I
can no longer revive her.

01:24:23.983 --> 01:24:25.818
And then what?

01:24:25.850 --> 01:24:27.386
She'll be dead.

01:24:29.954 --> 01:24:31.756
Anna, Anna.

01:24:31.789 --> 01:24:34.827
I love you so much, it's gonna
be okay.

01:24:34.859 --> 01:24:38.931
Three, two, one!

01:24:40.032 --> 01:24:41.766
You'll regret this!

01:24:41.800 --> 01:24:42.635
Move back!

01:24:42.667 --> 01:24:43.536
Why!

01:24:45.470 --> 01:24:46.938
You did this!

01:24:46.971 --> 01:24:48.773
You let him kill me, Mom!

01:24:52.411 --> 01:24:54.213
- No.
- I trusted you!

01:25:10.929 --> 01:25:12.597
That's it.

01:25:12.631 --> 01:25:13.566
Cardiac arrest.

01:25:26.645 --> 01:25:29.682
Is it supposed to work this
way?

01:25:31.716 --> 01:25:32.918
I don't know.

01:25:35.087 --> 01:25:36.522
No, it's not working.

01:25:36.555 --> 01:25:37.657
Revive her!

01:25:37.689 --> 01:25:39.024
It's too early.

01:25:39.692 --> 01:25:41.661
How do you know she's
gonna get into this cat?

01:25:41.694 --> 01:25:42.862
She has to.

01:25:42.895 --> 01:25:45.431
If she doesn't she will lose
her connection to our world.

01:25:45.463 --> 01:25:48.000
30 seconds!

01:25:48.033 --> 01:25:49.569
Come on, come on, come on!

01:25:51.869 --> 01:25:54.006
Do something, we have to do
something, it's not working.

01:25:54.038 --> 01:25:55.340
Keep fighting her!

01:25:55.373 --> 01:25:56.775
Keep fighting her!

01:25:57.743 --> 01:25:59.011
Come on, bitch, take me.

01:25:59.043 --> 01:25:59.878
I'm here.

01:25:59.912 --> 01:26:01.847
No!

01:26:01.880 --> 01:26:03.815
Take me, take me!

01:26:10.655 --> 01:26:13.024
You have to save her
now, she's in my head.

01:26:13.057 --> 01:26:15.962
I can't trust myself not to kill
her.

01:26:17.429 --> 01:26:19.398
Get her away from me.

01:26:23.068 --> 01:26:24.871
Get her away from me!

01:26:41.686 --> 01:26:42.721
Come on.

01:27:12.417 --> 01:27:13.118
Come on.

01:27:13.152 --> 01:27:14.619
Anna.

01:27:33.037 --> 01:27:34.840
Charging.

01:27:35.908 --> 01:27:37.910
Come on, baby, please.

01:27:39.144 --> 01:27:40.512
Press flashing.

01:27:40.546 --> 01:27:42.648

Anna, come on.

01:27:47.019 --> 01:27:48.154
Come on, baby.

01:27:52.090 --> 01:27:54.059
Come on, come on.

01:27:57.529 --> 01:27:59.799
Press
flashing, shock delivered.

Is everything okay, honey?

01:29:14.539 --> 01:29:15.173
Yeah.

01:29:16.942 --> 01:29:18.077
Blow out your candles.

01:29:25.250 --> 01:29:29.255
Yay.

01:29:30.188 --> 01:29:31.257
Who wants cake?

01:29:31.289 --> 01:29:34.025
- Me!
- Thank you.

01:29:34.059 --> 01:29:36.829
- Can we open presents?
- Is everyone excited?

01:29:36.862 --> 01:29:37.930
Me!

01:29:39.030 --> 01:29:40.800
So, what did you wish for?

01:29:41.699 --> 01:29:43.702
Just the general stuff.

01:29:45.237 --> 01:29:47.038
Can we play some games?

01:30:02.251 --> 01:30:07.251
