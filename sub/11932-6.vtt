WEBVTT

00:02.719 --> 00:05.720
Certainly. Turn left at Lighting
and it's just past Ladies Wear.

00:05.760 --> 00:07.760
Nice one, ta.

00:07.800 --> 00:11.320
We should leave. People are giving
us some pretty dirty looks.

00:11.360 --> 00:13.360
No, we fit right in, man!

00:13.400 --> 00:16.640
Sure, we might not be cash rich, but
it's obvious we're classy guys.

00:16.680 --> 00:18.680
Here we go, the taster counter.

00:18.720 --> 00:21.240
Get stuck in, it's free.
Yep, really classy.

00:21.280 --> 00:23.720
If you load up, you can
taste a full meal.

00:23.760 --> 00:26.640
Can I help you, gentlemen?
We're just browsing, thanks.

00:26.680 --> 00:27.920
And eating.

00:27.960 --> 00:29.480
I'm browsing with my mouth.

00:29.520 --> 00:31.440
Just having a little taste
- try before you buy.

00:31.480 --> 00:34.000
And are you planning to
buy that chicken leg?

00:34.920 --> 00:37.920
Probably not now, to be honest.
We're sorry about this.

00:37.960 --> 00:40.040
No, we're not! This
is totally legit.

00:40.080 --> 00:43.640
For all this guy knows, we could
be mega-minted poshos in disguise.

00:43.680 --> 00:45.800
It would be a superb
disguise. Cheers.

00:45.840 --> 00:49.440
Take us to the bed section, my good
man. I want to try one of them.

00:49.480 --> 00:51.280
Security!

00:53.000 --> 00:59.074

01:08.960 --> 01:11.280
Agh. This chair is
like a torture device.

01:11.320 --> 01:14.360
I've asked Flavia for one with
back support so many times.

01:14.400 --> 01:16.480
At least you get a chair. I
have to stand still all day.

01:16.520 --> 01:19.560
Think you could stand a bit stiller?
Hard to score if you're jiggling.

01:19.600 --> 01:21.040
I don't want you to score!

01:21.080 --> 01:23.800
Come on! Getting balls in your jug
is the only fun part of my day.

01:23.840 --> 01:25.640
Stop it! Calm down.

01:25.680 --> 01:28.200
I don't want them in my
jug. Open your mouth, then.

01:28.240 --> 01:31.480
Give him something to aim at. I
don't want your balls in my mouth!

01:31.520 --> 01:33.720
It might shut you up
for once, water boy.

01:33.760 --> 01:36.960
Sorry. He's been trying to get balls
in my jug all day. I don't care.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.200
Paper balls. Stop
talking. Water man.

01:39.240 --> 01:42.720
Boys, I'd like to introduce you to
Ramases, he's on work experience.

01:42.760 --> 01:44.160
Hey, guys. Cool office.

01:44.200 --> 01:46.240
I'm giving him a
tour of the company,

01:46.280 --> 01:49.040
starting with the talking turds
in the copy room and working up.

01:49.080 --> 01:51.160
We should press on
before we catch worms.

01:51.200 --> 01:53.320
Could I stay and play the
jug game for a bit, please?

01:53.360 --> 01:55.640
No, we're going to the
grain store. Chop, chop!

01:55.680 --> 01:59.000
Have you thought about my request
for a chair with back support?

01:59.040 --> 02:01.440
I have, and if the problem
persists, I will take steps...

02:01.480 --> 02:04.360
It will - ..to hire a copier
with a stronger back.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.920
Right. I'm sure I'll
manage, then. Good.

02:10.639 --> 02:12.240
It's so bloody demeaning.

02:12.280 --> 02:15.080
Even that gimpy work-experience
kid is treated better than us.

02:15.120 --> 02:18.480
You can say that again. He's
got a sedan chair, look! Hup!

02:18.520 --> 02:22.560
Oi, Ramases! It's Stylax and
Marcus, the talking turds.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.320
Hey, guys. Is this
sedan chair yours?

02:25.360 --> 02:27.080
It's my dad's, actually.

02:27.120 --> 02:29.200
I sort of crashed my one
taking it off-road.

02:29.240 --> 02:32.640
Holy shit! I know, it was really
stupid and I've learned my lesson.

02:32.680 --> 02:35.680
My dad's one's way bigger,
though, if you guys need a lift.

02:50.360 --> 02:52.120
All right. Who's the flat-top?

02:52.160 --> 02:54.560
This is Ramases. He's Egyptian.

02:54.600 --> 02:57.360
Right, yeah. Them the ones
with the pointy houses?

02:57.400 --> 03:00.280
Pyramids, yeah. Please, guys,
you can call me Rambo.

03:00.320 --> 03:03.400
I said Rambo could join us
for dinner tonight, Grumio?

03:03.440 --> 03:05.800
Fine, yeah. There is no dinner.

03:05.840 --> 03:07.760
Right. First-class slaving.

03:07.800 --> 03:10.600
It's cool. I've got my dad's
charge card for the Emporium

03:10.640 --> 03:12.520
if you wanna run and
grab some stuff.

03:12.560 --> 03:16.960
Wicked. I mean, I'd rather not run
but... So take the sedan, if you like.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.360
Yeah.

03:18.400 --> 03:20.040
I do like.

03:25.640 --> 03:26.960
Excuse me.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.040
No, no, no, not you again. Shoo!

03:30.080 --> 03:33.560
Hop it. I will not allow you
to ravage our luxury foods.

03:33.600 --> 03:35.600
How about I buy 'em, then?

03:38.920 --> 03:40.920
Ptolemy Hachmenenet?

03:40.960 --> 03:42.920
Is the name of my master, yes.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.400
He sent me to fetch his scran.

03:45.840 --> 03:49.520
And I am absolutely delighted
you chose us, sir.

03:49.560 --> 03:53.360
Pray tell what your master is craving
and I will do my utmost to help.

03:53.400 --> 03:56.040
I thought you might. Well,
he mainly likes meat.

03:56.080 --> 03:58.080
Lovely. Shall I fetch a basket?

03:58.120 --> 03:59.640
Get a trolley, I would.

04:07.440 --> 04:09.880
I thought I'd cover all
the major food groups.

04:09.920 --> 04:12.920
So sorry about this, Rambo. It's
cool, man, it's Dad's money.

04:12.960 --> 04:14.360
He won't even notice.

04:15.480 --> 04:17.480
You ever had mice?

04:17.519 --> 04:20.200
We have, but more as an
infestation than a delicacy.

04:20.240 --> 04:22.079
So is Daddy properly loaded?

04:22.120 --> 04:24.120
Er...yeah, I guess so.

04:24.760 --> 04:28.320
He owns, like, a shipping
company and a sawmill thing

04:28.360 --> 04:31.480
and a marble... whatever
it's called - hole?

04:31.520 --> 04:33.240
Quarry? Yeah!

04:33.280 --> 04:34.720
And the grain company.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.840
The grain company that we
work for? He owns that?

04:38.880 --> 04:40.320
Yeah.

04:40.360 --> 04:43.120
Well, I actually own it now.
He kind of gave it to me.

04:43.160 --> 04:46.080
Boom! Well done,
Rambo. Well, sort of.

04:46.120 --> 04:48.920
I'd much rather be working at the
shipping place, to be honest.

04:48.960 --> 04:52.160
But I sort of burnt my boats
there after the er...fire.

04:52.200 --> 04:55.360
So Dad moved me to grain, which
is obviously super lame!

04:55.400 --> 04:57.600
But at least I met you guys.

05:00.520 --> 05:02.120
Nice mice.

05:03.280 --> 05:05.560
The spoilt brat has
the whole company.

05:05.600 --> 05:08.000
When I was his age, I
didn't even have pubes.

05:08.040 --> 05:10.240
Really? You said he was 16?

05:10.280 --> 05:11.840
Yeah, I was a late starter.

05:11.880 --> 05:15.160
The point is, this kid can force
Flavia to get me a new chair.

05:15.200 --> 05:18.080
And fix the bogs, and oil
that very squeaky door.

05:18.120 --> 05:20.320
And lower the price of grain.

05:20.360 --> 05:22.520
Er...yeah, maybe. I mean -

05:22.560 --> 05:26.040
People are starving, Marcus. I
haven't eaten bread for weeks.

05:26.080 --> 05:27.715
I thought you were on
a wheat-free diet?

05:27.915 --> 05:29.760
Not by choice, dickhead.
I can't afford it.

05:29.800 --> 05:34.200
The grain companies are fucking us in the
arse, and expecting us to swallow it.

05:34.240 --> 05:36.120
Yeah, that does sound bad.

05:36.160 --> 05:39.560
It's a disgrace, and a little
more urgent than a squeaky door.

05:39.600 --> 05:45.640
You haven't heard it. It's like...
Eee-whaaargh...

05:45.680 --> 05:49.000
But, yeah, ending starvation.
I'll add that to the list.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.920
Salve, Grumio. All
right, landlord.

05:56.960 --> 05:59.440
Obvious question - why
are you licking a bag?

05:59.480 --> 06:02.080
Yeah, I got in a load of
posh nosh last night.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.320
The bag's still got
salami juice on it.

06:04.360 --> 06:06.800
Lovely, lovely. Do
you fancy a dab?

06:06.840 --> 06:08.840
No, I'll leave it
for now, thanks.

06:17.160 --> 06:19.840
No, I've still got Rambo's card.

06:21.240 --> 06:24.720
Yes! I've still got
Rambo's chuffing card!

06:31.360 --> 06:33.240
Yep, my master will like that.

06:33.280 --> 06:35.320
Your master must be
quite the foodie, sir.

06:35.360 --> 06:37.880
He's one of the foodiest
fellas you'll ever meet.

06:37.920 --> 06:39.920
What else is good here, then?

06:39.960 --> 06:41.960
Now, we are famed
for our seafood.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.960
You what? See food?
What's 'see food'?

06:45.000 --> 06:48.120
Fruits de mer, sir - cockles,
whelks, crabs, mussels...

06:48.160 --> 06:50.440
Them shiny pebbles?
That's food, is it?

06:50.480 --> 06:54.280
They are something of a delicacy,
sir. Well, bung 'em in the bag.

06:55.800 --> 06:57.920
And give me one of
them pies with legs.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.040
No, no!

07:03.880 --> 07:06.600
Keep still! No, you're not
even supposed to be in here.

07:06.640 --> 07:08.720
Two points for
straight in? Wicked.

07:08.760 --> 07:11.320
And one point if it goes in
off the backboard. Backboard?

07:11.360 --> 07:13.520
Do you mean me? What are
we calling this game?

07:13.560 --> 07:15.680
How about... 'Get the
ball in the jug'?

07:15.720 --> 07:19.120
Or 'Super juggy throw throw'?
Or... Jugball?

07:19.160 --> 07:21.040
Yes, jugball!

07:21.080 --> 07:24.760
You're a genius! We should play
every day. Make it company policy.

07:24.800 --> 07:26.800
Right, yeah!

07:26.840 --> 07:30.440
Brilliant. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
That would be brilliant.

07:30.480 --> 07:33.480
In fact, there are loads of
cool changes you could make

07:33.520 --> 07:35.200
now you're in charge, Rambo.

07:35.240 --> 07:39.960
We could have - I dunno, comfy chairs,
working toilets, non-squeak doors...

07:40.000 --> 07:41.520
What do you mean, 'in charge'?

07:41.560 --> 07:43.800
If you lower the price of
grain, people will buy more.

07:43.840 --> 07:47.120
Steady on, Professor. I don't get
any of that business-y shit.

07:47.160 --> 07:48.880
I said I'd leave all
that to Flavia.

07:48.920 --> 07:52.080
He's just a dickless intern!
Flavia is out of touch.

07:52.120 --> 07:54.560
She just sits in her office
getting her nails done,

07:54.600 --> 07:57.480
while the staff get bad
backs and blocked-up bogs.

07:57.520 --> 08:00.640
Sorry, Prof. I promised my dad
I wouldn't rock the boat.

08:00.680 --> 08:03.360
I did that at the shipping company
and three people drowned.

08:03.400 --> 08:05.320
I should just keep my head down.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.880
Sorry... Do you own the
company? Big time.

08:08.920 --> 08:11.360
Right, well, in that case,
I will keep my jug still.

08:11.400 --> 08:13.080
Sorry for calling you dickless.

08:14.560 --> 08:17.320
Yes, congratulations,
boss! Great throw!

08:39.559 --> 08:43.480
From downtown for five points...
Interception! Turnover.

08:43.520 --> 08:46.120
Interception? Since when?
Just now. He shoots...

08:47.160 --> 08:48.840
He scores! That's eight-all.

08:48.880 --> 08:51.360
New ball, please,
Prof. - coming up.

08:51.400 --> 08:53.320
We should make it doubles!

08:53.360 --> 08:56.200
Then we'd have someone to pass
to and high-five! Yes, love it!

08:56.240 --> 08:58.600
Let's choose team-mates.
Who's sporty here?

08:58.640 --> 09:00.840
Everyone, who's good at sport?

09:00.880 --> 09:03.920
No! Whatever it is that's
happening out here, no!

09:03.960 --> 09:05.920
And why is water boy
strapped to a column?

09:05.960 --> 09:09.080
Water man. But, yes, I completely
agree. We're playing jugball.

09:09.120 --> 09:13.120
As I say, no. You're going to the
Legal Department, where I put you.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.880
Come on, it's eight-all.

09:14.920 --> 09:17.080
I'm sorry that this
massive grain company

09:17.120 --> 09:19.760
is getting in the way of your
cretinous game, shredder.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.440
It's not cretinous,
it's brilliant!

09:21.480 --> 09:24.000
And if you actually cared
about this company,

09:24.040 --> 09:28.080
you'd give people squeakier chairs and
lower the price of toilets or whatever.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.680
Right, guys? Yeah... Well,
something like that.

09:31.720 --> 09:34.960
OK. Well, clearly, someone's
a little bit tired.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.880
So let's go and get a
nice glass of milk.

09:36.920 --> 09:38.240
I'm not tired! You're tired.

09:38.280 --> 09:40.280
You're tired and you're fired.

09:41.840 --> 09:44.600
Excuse me? You're firing me?

09:44.640 --> 09:46.640
That's right, Flave.

09:46.680 --> 09:50.120
It's time to make way for a guy who
knows what's really needed here.

09:50.160 --> 09:53.240
You don't even know how
to wipe your own bottom.

09:53.280 --> 09:55.280
Not me, the Professor.

09:56.040 --> 09:59.360
He's got ideas - big ones.
Isn't that right, Prof?

10:00.080 --> 10:02.080
Damn right, Rambo. I see.

10:02.120 --> 10:05.240
In two days, you'll be
begging me to come back.

10:05.280 --> 10:06.320
Yeah?

10:06.360 --> 10:09.040
In two days, you'll be
begging us for change!

10:09.080 --> 10:10.520
On the streets!

10:10.560 --> 10:12.760
Yes, Prof! Rinser!

10:15.600 --> 10:18.080
Right, let's go jugball.
Everyone has to watch.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.000
Now, that's a good chair.

10:32.280 --> 10:35.640
Me tooth's all hurty. It's
one of my best ones and all.

10:35.680 --> 10:38.800
Maybe it's a wisdom tooth. Unlikely
Grumio'd have any of them.

10:39.680 --> 10:41.640
Why are you dressed
like an adult?

10:41.680 --> 10:44.240
Because I'm a big cheese, now,
baby, and don't you forget it.

10:44.280 --> 10:46.640
Don't you forget to lower
the price of grain, then.

10:46.680 --> 10:50.560
Yes, yes, on my list. Below fixing
the loos but above the squeaky door.

10:50.600 --> 10:52.360
You - we've gots to go.  Hoots!

10:55.040 --> 10:57.600
Good morning, everyone.
My name is Marcus Gallo.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.200
I'm the new Head of HR.

10:59.240 --> 11:03.240
Under my watch, this company is
going to look after everyone -

11:03.280 --> 11:05.360
from the brainy
boffins in Accounts,

11:06.040 --> 11:09.400
all the way down to Lena the
cleaner, starting today.

11:09.440 --> 11:10.798
Also starting today, guys,

11:10.998 --> 11:14.080
there's a big jugball tournament
here on the jugball court.

11:14.120 --> 11:18.480
Please come and watch Stylax and
his team-mate take on me and Urbo.

11:18.520 --> 11:20.080
Where'd you get him from?

11:20.120 --> 11:23.640
He works in Finance, I think.
Jove's sake, he's like a tree!

11:23.680 --> 11:25.680
Hence why he moved
me up here. What?

11:25.720 --> 11:28.400
You can't change the rules
just cos you found a tree man.

11:28.440 --> 11:31.640
You have to check with me first.
No, it's my sport. I invented it.

11:31.680 --> 11:34.000
I've been playing it for
ages! It's my sport.

11:34.040 --> 11:36.520
Is this still the
meeting? No, ignore that.

11:36.560 --> 11:38.560
Basically, my point was...

11:39.280 --> 11:41.280
Hello, I'm Marcus.

11:41.320 --> 11:44.720
I'm gonna do some really good
stuff around here for you. So...

11:44.760 --> 11:47.560
Like what? Like, well...

11:48.280 --> 11:53.200
give you comfier chairs and unblock the
toilets... and oil that squeaky door.

11:55.280 --> 11:57.280
Thank you.

11:57.720 --> 11:59.440
Yes, exactly.

11:59.480 --> 12:02.840
For too long, this company has
put profits above people.

12:02.880 --> 12:04.040
Yeah.

12:04.080 --> 12:08.520
If there's anything you need at any
point, just ask and I will deliver.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.560
Thank you very much.

12:11.640 --> 12:14.320
Could I go and find a big man
for my jugball side, please?

12:14.360 --> 12:17.920
Yeah. Not exactly what I had in
mind, but OK, fine. Wicked, thanks.

12:24.640 --> 12:27.200
It's terrible! I
can't eat anything.

12:27.240 --> 12:29.400
You don't know any
dentists, do you?

12:29.440 --> 12:33.640
Davus here could extract the bad
tooth, if you want. What, really?

12:33.680 --> 12:37.400
Is he a dentist, then? Well, he's
a dentish. He's got a hammer.

12:37.440 --> 12:39.200
Davus? Yeah?

12:39.240 --> 12:43.520
Smash out Grumio's bad tooth. Of
course, boss. Just give it a wipe.

12:43.560 --> 12:45.120
Very good. Very medical.

12:45.160 --> 12:47.760
All right, fella. Just
lean back for me there.

12:48.680 --> 12:51.280
Do you not want to know
which tooth it is first?

12:52.120 --> 12:53.680
Yeah, go on, then, mate.

12:53.720 --> 12:55.760
It's that wonky one there.

12:55.800 --> 12:57.440
I'll sort of aim
in that ballpark.

12:57.480 --> 12:59.320
Stay still for me.

12:59.960 --> 13:01.880
I-I might leave it, actually.

13:01.920 --> 13:03.560
Yeah, probably for the best.

13:07.520 --> 13:08.920
No, I don't like it!

13:12.640 --> 13:15.280
Everyone's loving it
under the new boss, man.

13:15.320 --> 13:17.200
I've heard several
people call you 'nice'

13:17.240 --> 13:19.600
and one woman even
say 'fairly hot'.

13:19.640 --> 13:23.440
Well, if you listen to what people
need, they will thank you for it.

13:23.480 --> 13:26.840
Thanks for letting me get my new
partner, by the way, Big Paulus.

13:26.880 --> 13:29.160
Good, isn't he? Well,
he's tall, yeah.

13:29.200 --> 13:31.440
Which is what it's all about
now we've raised the jug

13:31.480 --> 13:33.560
and swapped the
papyrus for apples.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.600
Bitey-bitey, eyes shut tighty!

13:37.760 --> 13:40.800
My Jove! Where did
you get him from?

13:40.840 --> 13:42.840
I just saw him guarding
the grain store.

13:42.880 --> 13:45.520
I was, like, 'Big boy,
you're coming with me!'

13:45.560 --> 13:47.400
And I'm killing Rambo
thanks to you.

13:47.440 --> 13:48.800
You are welcome.

13:49.760 --> 13:52.560
Hang on...so who's guarding
the grain store now?

13:52.600 --> 13:55.320
Yeah, no... no one.

14:02.600 --> 14:03.960
Shit!

14:04.000 --> 14:05.120
Stop!

14:06.520 --> 14:08.440
Stop! Stop it!

14:11.720 --> 14:13.560
Oi! Oi!

14:16.000 --> 14:17.840
Well, well, well.

14:17.880 --> 14:19.120
The Professor.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.240
What brings you out here, then?

14:21.280 --> 14:24.400
Just concluding... you
know, a big sale.

14:25.000 --> 14:27.960
Pleasure doing
business with you!

14:28.000 --> 14:30.400
How much did they
steal? Not much.

14:31.320 --> 14:33.320
A bit, yeah. Quite
a lot, actually.

14:33.360 --> 14:35.320
It's fine, though.
I can handle it.

14:35.360 --> 14:36.920
Of course you can.

14:36.960 --> 14:39.600
If you'll excuse me, I've just
bought darling little Rex.

14:39.640 --> 14:41.920
I've got a busy day of
stroking ahead of me.

14:41.960 --> 14:45.280
Out of interest, what would
you do if you were me?

14:45.320 --> 14:47.560
Some kind of nose
job, I imagine.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.560
About the burglary.

14:49.600 --> 14:53.000
That's easy - make a few cutbacks,
fire some of the fat ones.

14:53.040 --> 14:57.240
And if you're very low on grain,
you're gonna have to raise the price.

14:57.280 --> 14:59.160
Right, yeah. That's
not an option.

14:59.200 --> 15:01.720
So maybe get fired and
buy a puppy, then.

15:01.760 --> 15:03.680
Really working for me.

15:08.200 --> 15:11.520
Which style of cuisine would your
master most favour today, sir?

15:11.560 --> 15:15.240
He's still keen on the seafood
but he's after something...soft.

15:15.280 --> 15:16.600
Soft, sir?

15:16.640 --> 15:19.160
He's a busy man, he don't
want to waste time chewing.

15:19.200 --> 15:21.200
I understand completely.

15:21.240 --> 15:23.280
I would suggest caviar.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.560
Caviar, what?
They're fish eggs.

15:25.600 --> 15:27.680
Soft as silk but
terrifically tasty.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.400
Fish eggs?

15:30.880 --> 15:32.880
Fish eggs?

15:33.960 --> 15:35.320
Fish eggs?

15:41.320 --> 15:43.320
Now that, my friend, is scrummy.

15:46.200 --> 15:47.800
Hello again.

15:47.840 --> 15:50.360
Just to say, despite
what I said earlier,

15:50.400 --> 15:54.520
we sadly had a burglary this afternoon,
so now have to make a few cutbacks.

15:54.560 --> 15:56.280
Fixing the toilets
will have to wait.

15:56.320 --> 15:58.160
Typical! It is typical.

15:58.200 --> 16:02.280
It's typical of one or two antisocial
grain thieves who ruin it for everyone.

16:02.320 --> 16:06.360
It's your fault for moving Big Paulus
up here to play their stupid jug game.

16:06.400 --> 16:07.880
Shut up. It's a great game.

16:07.920 --> 16:10.440
Either way, we also can't
afford new chairs.

16:10.480 --> 16:12.120
Classic!

16:12.160 --> 16:14.760
You say you're one of us but
you're just another lying exec

16:14.800 --> 16:17.440
looking after your mates. I,
for one, won't stand for it.

16:17.480 --> 16:19.400
Right, OK.

16:19.440 --> 16:22.440
Anyone else won't stand for it? Raise
your hand if you won't stand for it.

16:23.760 --> 16:25.553
That is good to know
because we do need to

16:25.753 --> 16:27.720
make some redundancies,
so you're all fired.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.240
What? I was stretching!
I will stand for it.

16:30.280 --> 16:32.760
We need to reduce
spending pretty urgently.

16:32.800 --> 16:35.360
I'm afraid it's a case
of 'no pain, no grain'.

16:35.400 --> 16:38.800
Yeah, Prof, the company bought this
gold jug for the tournament later.

16:38.840 --> 16:41.560
So we'll need a bit
more pain, then.

16:41.600 --> 16:42.880
Sorry.

16:42.920 --> 16:47.160
Let's lose... the guy with the
monobrow and Lena the cleaner.

16:47.200 --> 16:48.760
What? You can't fire Lena!

16:48.800 --> 16:52.200
Why are you still here? End of
meeting, everyone back to work.

16:52.240 --> 16:54.640
Apart from those who've been
sacked. You have to go.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.680
Now.

17:00.960 --> 17:02.960
Not even fixed the squeaky door!

17:11.560 --> 17:14.119
Fish eggs. Cor.

17:20.160 --> 17:24.000
Workers united will
never be defeated!

17:24.040 --> 17:28.000
The workers united will
never be defeated!

17:28.920 --> 17:30.760
No, please!

17:32.880 --> 17:34.400
I'm a worker too!

17:34.440 --> 17:36.120
I'm working very hard here!

17:36.160 --> 17:38.480
Lena's worked here for 45 years.

17:38.520 --> 17:40.440
So she probably
needs a rest, then!

17:40.480 --> 17:42.800
Give us back our
jobs, you arsehole.

17:42.840 --> 17:44.600
Not now you all hate me.

17:44.640 --> 17:48.160
The workers united will
never be defeated!

17:48.200 --> 17:50.520
..cheaper grain. When
do we want it? Now!

17:50.560 --> 17:54.360
What do we want? Cheaper grain!
When do we want it? Now!

17:54.400 --> 17:56.600
Delphine? What are
you doing here?

17:56.640 --> 17:58.640
What are you doing here, Marcus?

17:58.680 --> 18:01.400
You said you'd cut grain prices
and then you raised them!

18:01.440 --> 18:04.760
I had to! Can you not
protest against me, please?

18:04.800 --> 18:06.014
Why would you do that?

18:06.214 --> 18:09.360
Because he's looking after
himself and his cronies, love.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.840
Mate, I'm trying to have a
conversation with my girlfriend.

18:11.880 --> 18:13.880
You go out with this arsehole?

18:13.920 --> 18:16.160
I do, yes. And stop
calling me that!

18:16.200 --> 18:19.080
You could do a lot better!
Thank you. Shut up, please.

18:19.120 --> 18:22.080
I'd dump him. Dump
him! Dump him!

18:22.120 --> 18:24.440
Dump him! Dump him!

18:24.480 --> 18:26.120
Dump him!

18:29.520 --> 18:32.160
I mean, this is not how I
thought today would go. Yeah.

18:32.200 --> 18:33.600
Welcome to my world.

18:33.640 --> 18:35.640
OK, let's go, Team Rambo.

18:36.240 --> 18:37.440
Hit it, girls.

18:37.480 --> 18:41.360
# Rambo, Rambo, he's our man #
If he can't do it, no one can!

18:41.400 --> 18:43.080
What? Why don't I have girls?

18:43.120 --> 18:45.880
I invented the game, I get the
cheerleaders. That's the rules.

18:45.920 --> 18:49.440
Prof, I meant to say, I gave them all
jobs in marketing. Hope that's cool.

18:50.880 --> 18:52.520
You three are fired,
in that case.

18:52.560 --> 18:54.560
We can't afford you any more.

18:56.960 --> 18:59.000
Er...has it started yet?

18:59.040 --> 19:01.040
Not yet, G-Man,
you're just in time.

19:01.080 --> 19:02.280
Yo, Rambo.

19:02.320 --> 19:05.000
Looks like I got a
cheerleader of my own.

19:05.040 --> 19:07.800
Please don't employ him.
Give us a chant, G-Man.

19:08.480 --> 19:14.000
# Come on, Stylax, you can do it # Stick
that ball in the bastard jug Not bad.

19:22.240 --> 19:24.000
# Rambo!

19:30.680 --> 19:32.200
Paulus!

19:41.040 --> 19:43.000
Rambo! Agh!

19:45.080 --> 19:46.840
OK. 53-all.

19:46.880 --> 19:48.360
Next point wins.

19:48.400 --> 19:49.760
Urbo!

19:53.200 --> 19:54.480
Yes, Paulus!

19:54.520 --> 19:56.560
Bitey-bitey, eyes shut tighty!

20:06.560 --> 20:08.200
Hi, Dad.

20:08.240 --> 20:10.400
Don't you 'hi, Dad'
me, you little prick.

20:10.440 --> 20:13.560
What did I say? What's the
one thing I told you to do?

20:13.600 --> 20:16.840
Floss? Keep your
nut down! I did!

20:16.880 --> 20:18.520
So why, for Sphinx's sakes,

20:18.560 --> 20:21.920
is there not one, but two protests
going on outside that door?

20:21.960 --> 20:24.640
The Professor did that,
not me. Well, hang on...

20:24.680 --> 20:28.320
And why are you chucking apples at
some geezer strapped to a column?

20:28.360 --> 20:30.920
Aurelius. Great to meet
you, sir. Love the beard.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.960
It's jugball. It's... He
invented it, it was all him.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.720
Finally, he admits it!

20:35.760 --> 20:37.440
I couldn't give a
pharaoh's fat one.

20:37.480 --> 20:40.840
I've only come here cos I've been
contacted by the bloody Emporium.

20:40.880 --> 20:45.720
You've spent 15,420 dinaris,
and mostly on caviar.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.640
That wasn't me, I
promise. Right.

20:47.680 --> 20:50.280
Tutankhamen, give me the
bleeding card back.

20:50.320 --> 20:53.720
I don't know where it is. I haven't
seen it since I gave it to...

20:55.680 --> 20:57.360
Brilliant.

21:01.720 --> 21:03.360
Have you got my card, boy?

21:03.400 --> 21:05.400
Yeah.

21:06.000 --> 21:07.960
Give it back, then, fuck face.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.760
I'd rather not, to be honest.

21:09.800 --> 21:11.480
Give it to me.

21:11.520 --> 21:13.600
Let it go. Let it go.

21:15.080 --> 21:16.800
Thank you.

21:17.680 --> 21:21.120
Now, you, my palm, your
arse, now. Move it!

21:22.720 --> 21:24.720
I'll eat you alive,
I'm telling you.

21:25.840 --> 21:27.240
Bull's-eye.

21:27.280 --> 21:30.080
Me tooth! He's knocked
out me hurty tooth!

21:36.160 --> 21:38.160
Well, I couldn't say no.

21:39.120 --> 21:41.840
Ptolemy made me an
absurdly generous offer.

21:41.880 --> 21:43.920
What about that puppy you
were carrying around?

21:43.960 --> 21:45.840
I put him down - in every sense.

21:45.880 --> 21:49.960
That little dirt dispenser
shat all over my mosaic.

21:50.000 --> 21:51.960
And Rambo, was he put down?

21:52.000 --> 21:53.360
Sadly not.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.520
He's now managing the
family vineyard,

21:55.560 --> 21:59.360
which sounds like a monumentally
stupid idea to me, but there you go.

21:59.400 --> 22:02.000
...and how about us?

22:02.040 --> 22:04.040
Are there still
jobs for us here?

22:04.080 --> 22:07.800
Yes. I've got some
'big jobs' for you.

22:12.560 --> 22:14.080
Quick game of spongebucket?

22:15.080 --> 22:16.400
Yeah, go on, then.
