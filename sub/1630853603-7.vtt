I'm Lin Brehmer,

00:11.165 --> 00:12.034
It's great to be alive.

00:12.067 --> 00:14.673
So let's start today
with a songwriter,

00:14.706 --> 00:17.679

on the stage of the Metro

00:17.712 --> 00:20.284
as the Christmas Unicorn,

00:20.317 --> 00:24.259
a rare and beautiful creature
costumed in stunning colors.

00:24.292 --> 00:27.499
And while you've heard
all roads lead to Rome,

00:27.532 --> 00:30.538
some roads lead from Chicago.

00:30.571 --> 00:32.676
This is Sufjan Stevens.

00:32.709 --> 00:34.613
This is "Chicago."

00:34.646 --> 00:36.783
("Chicago" by
Sufjan Stevens playing)

"This writer, as all
my readers know,

"is devoted to Chicago

02:30.010 --> 02:32.649
"the neighborhoods are changing.

02:32.682 --> 02:34.553
"I'm fascinated
by the intersection

"of the stalwart

"and chronicling my findings.

The menu is slightly updated--"

03:24.586 --> 03:25.955
CARMY:
Twenty minutes to open, Chefs.

03:25.988 --> 03:27.526
-SYDNEY: Chef.
-CARMY: Syd, you set up?

03:27.559 --> 03:28.661
-Uh, yes, Chef, ready to go.
-CARMY: Thank you.

03:28.695 --> 03:31.032
EBRAHEIM:
"...and it's clear more
changes are coming."

03:31.065 --> 03:32.536
Chef, stop reading that shit.

03:32.569 --> 03:33.771
We got a lot to do today, okay?

03:33.804 --> 03:35.575
We open in 20,
to-go's live in 20.

03:35.608 --> 03:36.643
Let's fucking go.

03:36.677 --> 03:38.046
EBRAHEIM:
Oh, you'll like
this part, Carmy.

03:38.079 --> 03:39.015
You'll like this part, Carmen.

03:39.048 --> 03:40.919
"Even if the walls are stained,

03:40.952 --> 03:42.889
the staff moves are next level."

03:42.922 --> 03:44.560
Where is Tina?
She's still not here?

03:44.593 --> 03:46.497
Uh, no, Chef,
I'm covering her prep.

03:46.530 --> 03:48.601
Um, can we maybe--
Should we, like--

03:48.634 --> 03:52.274
EBRAHEIM:
"The sandwiches are
so delicious as ever,

03:52.307 --> 03:55.013
"but the standout dish that--

03:55.046 --> 03:57.017
"that, that encapsulates all,

03:57.050 --> 03:59.957
"this was the risotto
with braised beef.

03:59.990 --> 04:04.766
"The rice was luscious
with a surprising ribbon
of brine

04:04.799 --> 04:06.537
"running through the sauce.

04:06.570 --> 04:08.774
The chef obviously knew
what she was doing."

04:08.807 --> 04:10.945
Ebra, enough, please.
Back to work.

04:10.978 --> 04:11.981
-Thank you.
-Um...

04:12.014 --> 04:14.051
-So--
-Ribbon of brine, huh?

04:14.084 --> 04:17.626
Well, I gave a dish
to a customer

04:17.659 --> 04:18.761
because I didn't want
it to go to waste.

04:18.794 --> 04:20.498
I obviously didn't
know who he was.

04:20.531 --> 04:22.034
Chef, it's all good.
It's all good.

04:22.067 --> 04:24.840
Um, okay.
So, you know,
it was an accident

04:24.873 --> 04:25.742
and, and it's fine, right?

04:25.775 --> 04:27.779
Like, it's not weird
or anything like--

04:27.812 --> 04:29.516
-Good for business.
-Right, yes, exactly.

04:29.549 --> 04:30.685
-CHEF: Hey, Syd, congrats.
-Um, and, yeah,

04:30.718 --> 04:32.522
-I just wanna--
-CHEF: Yeah, you better
tell your pops.

04:32.555 --> 04:33.891
For sure.
And I just wanna
make sure, you know,

04:33.924 --> 04:34.927
like, everything's okay.

04:34.960 --> 04:36.797
It's not weird
or dumb, whatever.

04:36.830 --> 04:37.966
It's okay, Syd.

04:37.999 --> 04:39.536
It's not weird. It's good.

04:39.569 --> 04:40.805
-Yeah. Okay. Thanks.
-Alright?

04:40.838 --> 04:42.542
Sandwiches are totally
different, though.

04:42.575 --> 04:44.111
That guy's
a fuckin' hack anyway.

04:44.144 --> 04:45.615
Totally.

04:45.648 --> 04:47.586
-To-go boxes ready?
-Uh, yes, almost.

04:47.619 --> 04:48.721
-Thank you, Chef.
-TINA: Sorry.

04:48.755 --> 04:50.892
I'm sorry, sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

04:50.925 --> 04:52.996
-CARMY: Yo.
-Louie got suspended.

04:53.029 --> 04:55.000
Louie, apologize to Jeff.

04:55.033 --> 04:57.505
-Sorry, Jeff.
-That's alright, Louie.

04:57.538 --> 04:59.810
TINA:
Say hello to Jeff's friend.

04:59.843 --> 05:02.081
-Hi, Jeff's friend.
-SYDNEY: Hi, um, Louie.

05:02.114 --> 05:04.051
CARMY:
Hey, T, we got a lot to do
today, please hustle, okay?

05:04.084 --> 05:05.688
I need you to catch up.
Thank you, Chef.

05:05.721 --> 05:07.792
Yes, Jeff, but Louie--

05:07.825 --> 05:10.030
-CARMY: What about Louie?
-Um, he needs to know--

05:10.063 --> 05:11.967
You need to teach him how
to work in the kitchen.

05:12.000 --> 05:13.971
-BOTH: Today?
-TINA: Mm-hmm.

05:14.004 --> 05:16.677
Sure, Tina. Today, the day
we're running the new program.

05:16.710 --> 05:19.683
Um, Chef Sydney,
you got that, right?

05:19.716 --> 05:21.854
-Yeah. Sure.
-CARMY: Thank you, Chef.

05:21.887 --> 05:24.091
EBRAHEIM:
"But it was the coriander--"

05:24.124 --> 05:26.963
SYDNEY:
Okay, Ebra, let's
get to work, please.

05:28.066 --> 05:29.135
TINA:
What are you reading?

05:29.168 --> 05:31.740
EBRAHEIM:
Oh, a review, five stars.

05:31.773 --> 05:33.811
-TINA: Oh, shit!
-SYDNEY: It's nothing.

05:33.844 --> 05:35.013
-It's not--
-Is five stars good?

05:35.046 --> 05:36.149
EBRAHEIM:
Very good.

05:36.182 --> 05:37.719
-(clears throat)
-SYDNEY: What's up?

05:37.752 --> 05:39.623
I need help with him.

05:39.656 --> 05:41.660
Yo. Go wait in Jeff's office

05:41.693 --> 05:44.131
and think about
what the fuck you did.

05:44.164 --> 05:47.739
Uh, yeah, um, he is, um,

05:47.772 --> 05:50.712
you know,
getting into trouble,
doing dumb shit.

05:50.745 --> 05:52.081
Is not interested
in anything--

05:52.114 --> 05:53.718
So you brought him here?

05:53.751 --> 05:55.621
Hmm. Claro que sí.

05:56.155 --> 05:57.124
¿Por qué?

05:57.157 --> 05:58.961
Porque you taught me.

05:58.994 --> 06:00.163
You could teach him.

06:00.196 --> 06:02.034
Teach him what exactly?

06:02.067 --> 06:04.840
Uh, your skills, man.
You got skills.

06:04.873 --> 06:06.777
-SYDNEY: Skills?
-TINA: Yes.

06:06.810 --> 06:10.117
Shabby? This guy's
a hacky fuck, right?

06:10.150 --> 06:11.720
CARMY:
That's exactly what I said.

06:11.753 --> 06:14.025
Yo. Why's he talking
about risotto, Cousin?

06:14.058 --> 06:15.728
We don't have
risotto on the menu.

06:15.761 --> 06:18.601
That's a, uh, dish that
Sydney's been working on.

06:18.634 --> 06:21.005
And how did this
fuckin' mamaluke try it?

06:21.038 --> 06:23.443
Sydney accidentally
left it at his table.

06:23.476 --> 06:25.046
-Accidentally?
-Accidentally.

06:26.817 --> 06:29.055
Let me ask you,
what's the pickup on risotto?

06:29.088 --> 06:30.658
Feel like that's
kinda crazy, right?

06:30.691 --> 06:31.593
We're not gonna do that.

06:31.626 --> 06:32.293
No, we're not gonna do that.

06:32.327 --> 06:34.131
Fifteen minutes to open, Chefs!

06:34.164 --> 06:35.635
-ALL: Yes, Chef.
-CARMY: Thank you.

06:35.668 --> 06:36.804
RICHIE:
Oh, shit.

06:36.837 --> 06:38.708
Sydney, you blowing somebody

06:38.741 --> 06:39.943
down at The Telegraph?

06:39.977 --> 06:41.981
SYDNEY:
Yeah, Richie, that's exactly
what's happening.

06:42.014 --> 06:44.452
I'm blowing somebody
down at The Telegraph.

06:44.485 --> 06:46.857
Oh, Louiecito, get over here.

06:46.890 --> 06:48.059
Oh, my man.

06:48.092 --> 06:50.163
Whoa. You bulking up?

06:50.196 --> 06:52.736
-I'm trying, yeah.
-Yeah, man, looking good.

06:52.769 --> 06:55.808
Okay, um, can we please go
over the new system today?

06:55.841 --> 06:57.712
You got it, boss.

06:57.745 --> 07:01.620
Fascinating how you accidentally

07:01.653 --> 07:03.223
gave a dish that's
not on the menu...

07:03.256 --> 07:04.493
-CARMY: Cousin. Hey!
-...to a guy who happened to be

07:04.526 --> 07:06.195
-a food critic.
-CARMY: Do me a favor.
Shut the fuck up.

07:06.228 --> 07:08.033
No, it's just,
it's hard to digest.

07:08.066 --> 07:09.670
-Sydney, boxes.
-Yes, Chef.

07:09.703 --> 07:11.039
-Thank you so much.
-Gary, come on.

07:11.072 --> 07:12.074
PERSON:
What's a ribbon of brine?

07:12.107 --> 07:13.978
Okay, Chefs, listen up.

07:14.011 --> 07:17.686
Uh, I'm gonna turn
on the to-go's in 10 minutes.

07:17.719 --> 07:19.923
So we're gonna
count off, alright?

07:19.956 --> 07:21.159
Pars all day.

07:21.192 --> 07:23.063
Syd, salads. Count.

07:23.096 --> 07:24.165
SYDNEY:
Twenty-five all day, Chef.

07:24.198 --> 07:25.868
Twenty-five. Thank you.

07:25.901 --> 07:27.672
Grilled pars. Tina, chicken?

07:27.705 --> 07:28.941
TINA:
Uh, 32 all day, Chef.

07:28.974 --> 07:30.712
Thirty-two. Thank you.

07:30.745 --> 07:32.682
-Ebra, beef all day?
-EBRAHEIM: One hundred, Chef.

07:32.715 --> 07:33.984
One hundred. Thank you.

07:34.017 --> 07:35.822
Richie, go fuck yourself.

07:35.855 --> 07:37.024
RICHIE:
Sixty-nine all day, Chef.

07:37.057 --> 07:39.128
And, Marcus, cakes all day?

07:39.161 --> 07:40.898
Uh... Uh, give me a sec.

07:40.931 --> 07:41.900
CARMY:
Nope. Faster. How many?

07:41.933 --> 07:43.804
I just got a little behind.
I'mma catch up.

07:43.837 --> 07:45.675
Marcus, if you're still fucking
with those donuts right now

07:45.708 --> 07:47.077
I'm gonna fuck your day up.
You hear me?

07:47.110 --> 07:48.246
-MARCUS: Yes, Chef.
-Thank you, Chef.

07:48.279 --> 07:50.117
RICHIE:
No, no, no. Uh-uh.

07:50.150 --> 07:51.887
Nope. Sorry, guys.

07:51.920 --> 07:53.089
This is
the thunderdome
right here.

07:53.122 --> 07:54.860
Take the kindergarten
somewhere else.

07:54.893 --> 07:56.095
Not that I don't
appreciate the giddyup,

07:56.128 --> 07:57.197
but you're not
quite there yet.

07:57.230 --> 07:58.734
-Um, okay.
-Okay.

07:58.767 --> 08:00.938
Can we please talk about
the new to-go system?

08:00.971 --> 08:01.974
Yeah, you got it, boss.

08:02.007 --> 08:02.976
Fellas, I gotta talk to Sydney.

08:03.009 --> 08:04.145
Excuse me, lizards.

08:04.178 --> 08:05.982
Just, um, take this

08:06.015 --> 08:07.986
and do this over
by the deli counter.

08:08.019 --> 08:09.121
Yes. Thank you.

08:09.154 --> 08:10.223
CHEF:
Ten minutes to open, Chefs.

08:11.860 --> 08:13.597
Bravo.

08:13.630 --> 08:16.837
Alright, boss lady, you did it.

08:16.870 --> 08:18.641
Got your little
dish in the paper.

08:18.674 --> 08:19.843
A little to-go tablet.

08:19.876 --> 08:21.747
Everything's going
according to plan, huh?

08:21.780 --> 08:22.982
I have a plan?

08:23.016 --> 08:24.753
Yeah, this is what you wanted
to do from the beginning, right?

08:24.786 --> 08:26.022
You know, you push
my people out.

08:26.055 --> 08:28.794
-Your people?
-Yeah, you know, push
out the working man,

08:28.827 --> 08:31.065
-make room
for whatever fuckin'--
-The working man?

08:31.098 --> 08:33.036
jabronistas this stupid
article's gonna bring in.

08:33.069 --> 08:36.677
Sorry, um, are you the new
face of the working man?

08:36.710 --> 08:37.879
-Right.
-Richie, congrats.

08:37.912 --> 08:39.148
That is huge.

08:39.181 --> 08:41.018
-Bullshit aside--
-Huh?

08:41.051 --> 08:43.189
What's your angle?
Level with me.

08:43.222 --> 08:45.628
-My angle?
-Yeah.

08:45.661 --> 08:48.233
Uh, my angle's that
I was hired to work here.

08:48.266 --> 08:51.205
So now I'm working here
and I'm trying to bring
business in.

08:51.238 --> 08:53.644
-That's my angle.
-Yeah, but it's the wrong
kind of business.

08:53.677 --> 08:55.013
You know, you're bringing
in all these fucking strokes.

08:55.046 --> 08:57.786
-They're gonna
box out the OGs.
-Okay. The OGs?

08:57.819 --> 09:00.223
Yeah, bus drivers,
secretaries, teachers.

09:00.256 --> 09:01.927
-Sorry, are we just
naming professions?
-You know, it's just confusing.

09:01.960 --> 09:03.664
-I can do that too.
-People are gonna know...

09:03.697 --> 09:05.167
-Bricklayers, clock workers--
-...not know what's on the menu.

09:05.200 --> 09:07.237
What's not on the menu
is the risotto.

09:07.270 --> 09:09.041
Okay, well,
if there's confusion,

09:09.074 --> 09:10.845
let me help clarify some things.

09:10.878 --> 09:11.947
-RICHIE: Okay.
-Okay? Um.

09:11.980 --> 09:14.185
We all work
in a restaurant, right?

09:14.218 --> 09:17.224
And, um, we, uh, make
food in the restaurant.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.161
We all try to do a good job.
I don't know about you.

09:19.194 --> 09:20.665
But, anyway, people come

09:20.698 --> 09:22.201
and they buy their
food with money

09:22.234 --> 09:23.771
and they spend their money

09:23.804 --> 09:25.040
and then, uh, we
take our earnings

09:25.073 --> 09:28.046
and, um, just, you know,
live our lives.

09:28.079 --> 09:29.649
That's it.

09:29.682 --> 09:30.852
It's business.

09:30.885 --> 09:33.824
The point of this is
that it is a business,

09:33.857 --> 09:36.128
not, uh, some sort
of a hollow shell

09:36.161 --> 09:39.068
you can project your
dying fantasies or whatever.

09:39.101 --> 09:40.738
You don't need to get
nasty, young lady.

09:40.771 --> 09:43.844
And you just don't need
to speak to me at all, I guess.

09:43.877 --> 09:46.950
By the way, those OGs
you love waxing on and on about

09:46.983 --> 09:50.056
all come here,
split one sandwich
and a free cup of water

09:50.089 --> 09:51.760
and then treat
the rest of us like shit.

09:51.793 --> 09:52.929
RICHIE:
So this is a war on poor people?

09:52.962 --> 09:55.868
No, this is a war on you
shutting the fuck up, Richie,

09:55.901 --> 09:58.072
and learning how
to use the tablet.

09:58.105 --> 10:00.678
-The end, dude.
-CARMY: What is the end?

10:00.711 --> 10:03.116
(sighs) The end is that
I was telling Richie

10:03.149 --> 10:06.957
that we are learning how to use
the tablet, and it's good.

10:06.990 --> 10:09.228
And it's good for business,
and you and I agree.

10:09.261 --> 10:10.498
Yes. Your idea, but, yes.

10:10.531 --> 10:13.069
Yeah. But you agree w-with me
about the other thing, right?

10:13.102 --> 10:14.004
-SYDNEY: Uh, what other thing?
-What's the other thing?

10:14.037 --> 10:15.908
That, That people are
gonna come in here

10:15.941 --> 10:17.077
thinking they're
gonna get her food.

10:17.110 --> 10:18.981
That's some fuckin'
(speaks Italian)

10:19.014 --> 10:21.118
-millennial shit.
-You are not even Italian.

10:21.151 --> 10:22.855
Stop, it's a little
bit messy, okay?

10:22.888 --> 10:24.091
We will figure it out.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.227
I just turned on
the to-go tablet.

10:25.260 --> 10:26.964
-Are we ready?
-SYDNEY: No.

10:26.997 --> 10:27.966
CHEF:
Nine minutes to open, Chef.

10:27.999 --> 10:28.901
This is gonna be bad.

10:28.934 --> 10:29.803
-Um, Chef?
-Yes.

10:29.836 --> 10:32.307
Uh, sorry, I just
don't, uh, feel like

10:32.340 --> 10:34.111
we're on the same
page right now.

10:34.144 --> 10:35.715
-I feel like we're not good.
-We're good, Chef.

10:35.748 --> 10:36.884
Let's get through
the day, please.

10:36.917 --> 10:38.219
-TINA: Chef!
-CARMY: What?

10:38.252 --> 10:39.221
TINA:

10:39.254 --> 10:40.725

10:40.758 --> 10:41.826
CARMY:
What?

10:44.899 --> 10:46.001
Fuck. What the fuck?

10:47.170 --> 10:48.908
-Syd?
-SYDNEY: Uh, okay.

10:48.941 --> 10:52.949
Um, I, uh, uh, uh.
Cool. I don't know, um.

10:52.982 --> 10:54.786
You left the preorder
option open.

10:54.819 --> 10:56.857
SYDNEY:
O-Okay, uh... No. I'm sorry.

10:56.890 --> 10:58.928
-Yes.
-RICHIE: What's that mean?

10:58.961 --> 11:01.132
That means we have
78 slices of chocolate cake,

11:01.165 --> 11:04.773
99 French fries,
54 chickens, 38 salads

11:04.806 --> 11:08.948

due up in eight minutes.

11:08.981 --> 11:11.285
-So, yeah, Syd, fuck.
-I fuckin' told you.

11:11.318 --> 11:12.822
You didn't fuckin' tell me shit.

11:12.855 --> 11:14.058
Shut the fuck up!
Shut the fuck up!

11:14.091 --> 11:15.794
Let me think
for a fuckin' second.

11:16.963 --> 11:18.032
Fucking twice. I told you.

11:18.065 --> 11:19.000
I told you to be
more fucking ready.

11:19.034 --> 11:20.905
I told you that dish
wasn't fuckin' ready.

11:20.938 --> 11:22.040
What does this
have to do with this?

11:22.073 --> 11:23.242
Chef, stop! Stop!

11:26.950 --> 11:29.321

11:52.334 --> 11:54.939
They're gonna be

I'm gonna take green tape.
Make those sections. Louie?

11:56.976 --> 11:57.911
I want you to get

12:04.826 --> 12:07.799
Tina, fire every single chicken

12:09.969 --> 12:11.974
RICHIE:
Yes. I know we need 'em now.

12:12.007 --> 12:14.078
Okay, um, Marcus,

12:14.111 --> 12:15.080
MARCUS:
Uh, getting there.

12:15.113 --> 12:17.852
Getting there?
What the fuck do you-- Marcus?

12:17.885 --> 12:20.891
What the fuck are you doing
still working on this shit?

12:20.924 --> 12:22.194
MARCUS:
Yo, come on, what, what

12:22.227 --> 12:24.164
Come on?
What the fuck am I tripping for?

12:24.197 --> 12:25.968
-Are you here right now?
-It doesn't make a difference.

12:26.001 --> 12:27.137
There's four cakes and still--

12:27.170 --> 12:29.843
-Yeah, I was gonna cut them.
-They're not even cut yet?

12:29.876 --> 12:31.112
-Yeah, it's not
that big of a deal.
-CARMY: Yo, what is this?

12:31.145 --> 12:32.882

-Step out. Step out.

Corner. Oh!

13:04.645 --> 13:06.048
TINA:
Five minutes to open.

13:06.081 --> 13:07.217
SYDNEY:
Shit.

13:07.250 --> 13:09.455
You didn't say corner.

13:09.488 --> 13:10.857
You didn't say corner.

13:11.659 --> 13:12.861
Fuck you, Richie.

13:12.895 --> 13:15.601
-You don't need to curse
at me like a maniac.
-Fuck... you...

13:15.634 --> 13:17.939
-You didn't say corner.
-You're a fucking maniac, man.

13:17.972 --> 13:20.544
It's your bullshit that
fucked us today, not mine.

13:20.577 --> 13:21.947
It's your bullshit.

13:21.980 --> 13:23.249
Fuck you, Richie.

13:23.282 --> 13:24.986
-CARMY: Sydney?
-Fuck you.

13:25.019 --> 13:26.222
CHEF:
I like that pace, Louie.

13:26.255 --> 13:27.525
Yeah, baby.

13:27.558 --> 13:28.527
Chef, are you okay?

13:28.560 --> 13:30.498
Yeah, I'm fucking okay, Tina.

13:30.531 --> 13:32.067
Thank you.

13:32.100 --> 13:34.271
Hey, you don't need to be
screaming and shit.

13:34.304 --> 13:37.010
-That's not you.
-You know, maybe it is.

13:37.043 --> 13:38.479
Maybe it really is.

13:38.513 --> 13:40.584
I don't know what
you are going to learn

13:40.617 --> 13:44.191
o-or what Louie
is supposed to learn
in this shit hole of a place,

13:44.224 --> 13:46.897
but, please, just make sure
he keeps up on pace

13:46.930 --> 13:48.534
and, and, and that
you finish your shit.

13:48.567 --> 13:50.571
Okay, yes, Chef.
I just wanted to check and see--

13:50.604 --> 13:53.576
It's fine.
Please finish your prep.

13:54.679 --> 13:55.714
Yes, Chef.

13:55.748 --> 13:59.254
Still waiting on 55 beef,
24 chicken and pepper,

13:59.287 --> 14:01.025
41 dogs, six Greek salads.

14:01.058 --> 14:04.532
Somebody get me

14:04.565 --> 14:07.003

Get me a fucking Sharpie.

14:18.527 --> 14:20.531
Chef, hey, prep giardiniera.

14:20.564 --> 14:23.937
Fuck, we, uh, fired
two more cakes to go.

14:23.970 --> 14:25.541
-Fire two more cakes to go.
-No. No more orders.

14:25.574 --> 14:28.012
No more fucking--
Are you fucking deaf?

14:28.045 --> 14:30.618
Oh, I'm s-- You're extra
fucking confusing today, man.

14:30.651 --> 14:32.086
-Sharpie!
-(pounds table)

14:33.055 --> 14:34.158
-Fuck!
-Oh, my God.

14:34.191 --> 14:35.961
FAK:
Carmy is very mad.

14:36.663 --> 14:38.166
CARMY:
Christ.

14:38.199 --> 14:40.170
Hey, uh, what the fuck
are you doing?

14:40.203 --> 14:41.973
What does it look like?
I'm helping you.

14:42.006 --> 14:45.079
Uh, don't.
Uh, that's my vegetables, so--

14:45.112 --> 14:47.317
What are you talking about?
They're all going
in the same place here.

14:47.350 --> 14:49.722
It was the prep that
was assigned to me,

14:49.755 --> 14:51.626
so they are mine.

14:51.659 --> 14:53.463
Let go and go away.

14:53.497 --> 14:54.566
You know, there's
something broken in you.

14:54.599 --> 14:56.936
Alright?
You're being mean and it's ugly.

14:59.040 --> 15:02.214
You wanna talk about
fuckin' ugly, Richie?

15:02.247 --> 15:03.951
You are a loser.

15:03.984 --> 15:05.487
-You're a loser.
-No, Richie.

15:05.521 --> 15:06.957
-Yeah.
-You're the fuckin' loser

15:06.990 --> 15:08.159
-who can't do shit--
-You're a conceited

15:08.192 --> 15:09.261
and condescending
ribbon of brine--

15:09.294 --> 15:10.531
You can't peel
fucking vegetables.

15:10.564 --> 15:12.133
You can't fucking do shit.

15:12.166 --> 15:15.039
You waste space here.
You are a fucking loser.

15:15.072 --> 15:17.477
And that is why you hate
that I'm here, right?

15:17.511 --> 15:19.081
Because I see you

15:19.114 --> 15:21.620
for the loser
that you fucking are.

15:21.653 --> 15:23.222
And everybody knows it.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.993
I know it.
Harvey knows it.

15:25.026 --> 15:26.195
And your daughter
probably knows it.

15:26.228 --> 15:27.464
Poor fucking girl.

15:27.498 --> 15:29.201
So how about you
go to the register

15:29.234 --> 15:31.640
and do the one fucking thing
you know how to do?

15:31.673 --> 15:33.744
Yo, why are being such
a fucking bitch right now?

15:33.777 --> 15:36.148
I don't know, Richie, why am I?

15:36.181 --> 15:38.486
-Oh, you gonna fuckin' stab me?
-Yeah, maybe I fucking will.

15:38.520 --> 15:39.622
-Yeah?
-Giardiniera!

15:39.655 --> 15:41.025
Shut the fuck up!

15:41.058 --> 15:42.093
TINA:
Three minutes to open.

15:42.126 --> 15:43.497
Yo, Carmy, I did it.

15:43.530 --> 15:44.999
I figured out what
I was doing wrong.

15:45.032 --> 15:46.268
You know, I was trying
to make a cake donut

15:46.301 --> 15:48.005
when they should've been
yeast all along and--

15:48.038 --> 15:50.511
CARMY:
Marcus, why are you
fuckin' with me?

15:50.544 --> 15:51.713
Why are you fucking with me?

15:51.746 --> 15:54.586
Why are you fucking with me?
Why are you fucking with me?

15:54.619 --> 15:56.723
Huh? Get the fuck back to work!

15:56.756 --> 15:58.459
-Move.
-Holy shit.

15:58.493 --> 16:00.564
-SYDNEY: What the fuck?
-CARMY: Everybody,
fuckin' idiots!

16:00.597 --> 16:03.002
Yo, Cousin, just fuckin'--

16:03.035 --> 16:04.137
CARMY:
Shut the fuck up!

16:04.170 --> 16:05.507
-(screams)
-(gasps)

16:05.540 --> 16:07.545
-CARMY: Holy fucking shit!
-Fuck. Mother fuck.

16:07.578 --> 16:08.747
PERSON:
Yo. We have a customer out here.

16:08.780 --> 16:10.483
I got stabbed. Not right now.

16:10.517 --> 16:12.521
I got stabbed.
Son of a fuckin'--

16:12.554 --> 16:13.690
-Ebra.
-CARMY: Open in one minute!

16:13.723 --> 16:15.260
Ebra, I got stabbed.

16:15.293 --> 16:16.763
CARMY:
Probably fuckin' deserved it.

16:16.796 --> 16:18.633
If... M-Maybe.

16:18.733 --> 16:20.136
Yo, Louie, how we looking?

16:20.169 --> 16:21.606
-LOUIE: Good, uh.
-CARMY: Good. Sweet?

16:21.639 --> 16:22.742
LOUIE:
Thirty-seven, Chef.

16:22.775 --> 16:23.744
CARMY:
Keep going, please. Keep going.

16:23.777 --> 16:25.113
Thank you, Chef.

16:25.146 --> 16:26.650
Ebra, make that fuckin' fast!

16:26.683 --> 16:27.685
EBRAHEIM:
I'm trying.

16:27.718 --> 16:28.720
Ehh... fuck.

16:28.753 --> 16:29.755
Don't move.

16:32.226 --> 16:33.161
Uh... Is it bad?

16:33.195 --> 16:35.768
Tell me about the fuckin'
factions again.

16:35.801 --> 16:37.772
EBRAHEIM:
Stop moving.

16:37.805 --> 16:40.242
Siad Barre caused
violence, oppression.

16:41.078 --> 16:42.682
Civil War.

16:42.715 --> 16:44.351
Many factions, many groups,

16:44.384 --> 16:45.821
all fighting for power.

16:45.854 --> 16:47.725
The central government
collapsed.

16:47.758 --> 16:50.229
Somalia became a failed state.

16:50.262 --> 16:52.233
Many civilians were killed.

16:52.266 --> 16:55.273
Mohamed Farrah Aidid would not
cooperate with United Nations.

16:55.306 --> 16:58.312
United States sent troops
to take members of his team,

16:58.345 --> 16:59.649
tried to create peace.

16:59.682 --> 17:01.653
Yeah, but it didn't
create peace, did it?

17:01.686 --> 17:04.191
EBRAHEIM:
No, Battle of Mogadishu started

17:04.224 --> 17:05.761
when two helicopters came up--

17:05.794 --> 17:09.769
Wait, is this shit fuckin'
Black Hawk Down?

17:09.802 --> 17:11.071
EBRAHEIM:
Black Hawk Down.

17:11.104 --> 17:12.508
(scoffs)

17:12.541 --> 17:13.710
Fuckin' Piven.

17:13.743 --> 17:14.745
EBRAHEIM:
Piven.

17:24.297 --> 17:26.535
CARMY:
Where the fuck is Marcus?

17:28.339 --> 17:29.842
Yo, Jeff, we gotta open.

17:29.875 --> 17:32.314
CARMY:
One minute.
20 more chickens, fire.

17:32.347 --> 17:33.817
TINA:
We don't have anymore.

17:33.850 --> 17:36.589
Fuckin' find them,
God fuckin' damn it, Tina.

17:42.367 --> 17:44.672
-(Tina sighs)
-CUSTOMER:
You guys have risotto?

17:44.705 --> 17:45.674
TINA:

17:47.343 --> 17:48.847
Yo, we good?

17:48.880 --> 17:50.884
RICHIE:

thumb up your ass.

17:50.917 --> 17:52.153
CARMY:

17:52.186 --> 17:53.221
(man yells indistinctly)

17:54.658 --> 17:56.227
-We--
-CARMY: Chef, I can't hear you!

17:57.230 --> 17:59.134
We are not good.

17:59.167 --> 18:00.637
CARMY:
What?

18:00.670 --> 18:02.608
We are not good, Chef.

18:02.641 --> 18:04.177
CARMY:
No?

18:04.210 --> 18:05.613
What the fuck
you talkin' about?

18:06.949 --> 18:08.251
CARMY:
What's going on?

18:10.891 --> 18:12.695
Um...

18:12.728 --> 18:15.133
I quit is what's going on.

18:15.166 --> 18:16.636
-CARMY: You quit?
-Yeah, Chef.

18:16.669 --> 18:18.205
-CARMY: Right now?
-I fuckin' quit.

18:18.238 --> 18:19.541
CARMY:
You quit right now?

18:26.923 --> 18:28.158
What are you doing?

18:29.762 --> 18:31.833
You are an excellent chef.

18:31.866 --> 18:33.202
CARMY:
What are you doing?

18:33.235 --> 18:35.239
You are also a piece of shit.

18:35.272 --> 18:37.177
CARMY:
What are you doing?

18:37.210 --> 18:38.847
-This isn't on me.
-What are you doing?

18:38.880 --> 18:39.882
SYDNEY:
Good luck.

18:39.915 --> 18:42.554
(metal music playing)

19:10.844 --> 19:12.247
RICHIE:
Yo, Cousin, there's
a fuckin' line.

19:12.280 --> 19:13.382
Are we open or not?

19:13.415 --> 19:15.721
(music continues)

19:15.754 --> 19:16.689
(clears throat)

19:33.288 --> 19:34.391
(audience cheering)

19:34.424 --> 19:35.727
(machine whirring)

19:39.033 --> 19:40.571
(whirring continues)

19:40.604 --> 19:42.941
(cheering continues)

20:01.278 --> 20:03.950
(whirring continues)
