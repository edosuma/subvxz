WEBVTT

00:02.794 --> 00:05.130
We grew like brothers,

00:05.547 --> 00:09.926
having every experience togetheruntil we moved away for
college.

00:11.511 --> 00:13.388
And some say our bond was toxic,

00:13.388 --> 00:17.684
but I think of it as loyalty.

00:39.122 --> 00:42.083
We got to always have each other's back,

00:42.083 --> 00:43.585
no matter what.

00:46.838 --> 00:48.465
Let's make a pact right now.

00:49.924 --> 00:52.343
Imma always at your back Gordon.

00:59.642 --> 01:01.978
- We can't be here right now. - Let me go. Stop, please.

01:01.978 --> 01:04.230
- Let me go. No, no. - Dude we got to go.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.441
--we got to go right now.

01:14.199 --> 01:16.159
What the hell did you do?

01:17.660 --> 01:18.995
What did you do?

01:53.780 --> 01:59.452
I just wantedto say that I am guilty,

02:00.829 --> 02:03.081
I want to apologize
to the family

02:03.081 --> 02:04.874
for the young lady,

02:07.836 --> 02:10.338
to my own family for my irresponsible acts.

02:15.051 --> 02:17.428
I am ready to accept whatever punishment

02:17.428 --> 02:19.430
the courts may have reserved for me.

02:24.602 --> 02:27.230
Hm...look here boy.

02:28.982 --> 02:30.358
You,

02:32.068 --> 02:34.487
you're old enough to know exactly what you were doing.

02:35.780 --> 02:38.032
And if you were just one year older,

02:38.825 --> 02:39.701
hm,

02:40.368 --> 02:41.077
I'd throw everything,

02:41.077 --> 02:42.745
including the kitchen
sink at you,

02:42.745 --> 02:44.330
and your lawyer knows it.

02:46.040 --> 02:47.125
Look at me!

02:49.460 --> 02:51.254
There is no waythat there will ever be

02:51.254 --> 02:54.132
any fitting justice for this young lady! Ever!

02:55.466 --> 02:56.426
Ever!

02:59.637 --> 03:02.181
So Mr. Charlie Westbrook...

03:04.684 --> 03:07.312
As it pertains to the first count of aggravated assault

03:07.312 --> 03:08.980
with intention to cause bodily harm,

03:08.980 --> 03:10.982
I hereby sentence you

03:10.982 --> 03:14.485
to 45 days juvenile detention
and 2 year probation.

03:15.737 --> 03:17.530
Look at me!

03:20.199 --> 03:25.330
As it pertains to the second
count of sexual assault,

03:26.789 --> 03:30.627
I hereby sentence you to 60 days juvenile detention

03:30.627 --> 03:33.588
with an additional3 year probation period.

03:34.797 --> 03:38.176
Both sentences are to be served consecutively.

03:39.093 --> 03:40.511
Ask your lawyerwhat that means.

03:40.511 --> 03:41.471
Court is adjourned.

04:22.929 --> 04:24.764
I think you put too much on.

04:25.890 --> 04:27.392
Mom, please relax,

04:27.392 --> 04:29.143
I'm not going to cake makeup on you.

04:30.103 --> 04:31.980
Why are in such a mood today?

04:31.980 --> 04:34.774
Just have a lot of my mind.

04:34.983 --> 04:36.901
You are definitely in a mood.

04:37.652 --> 04:40.029
I just don't understand what the rush is.

04:40.655 --> 04:41.864
That's a valid perspective,

04:41.864 --> 04:43.783
but different strokes for different folks.

04:44.325 --> 04:46.077
No disrespect mom, but um,

04:46.077 --> 04:47.996
it's not intended for you to understand.

04:48.413 --> 04:50.790
Can you be happy for Morgan, please?

04:50.957 --> 04:53.001
She has to marry him, not you.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.462
You're the closest family member her.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.673
She's just not useto being this far away.

04:59.048 --> 05:00.466
She needs your support.

05:01.759 --> 05:04.595
If you ask me, it should be you and Chris being married.

05:05.638 --> 05:07.348
It's been almost 3 years now.

05:07.348 --> 05:08.683
What are y'all waiting for?

05:11.269 --> 05:12.270
We're dressed!

05:15.565 --> 05:16.774
Look at my baby!

05:18.151 --> 05:22.155
Ooh, absolutely gorgeous!

05:22.322 --> 05:24.198
Auntie..Krys.

05:26.159 --> 05:26.743
I love ya'll.

05:26.743 --> 05:27.910
Mama, you ready to do this veil?

05:27.910 --> 05:29.620
Yes, I'm ready.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.169
- And mama's veil.- Y'all make some noise

05:36.169 --> 05:38.504
as we present to y'all for the first time

05:38.504 --> 05:40.298
as husband and wife.

05:40.298 --> 05:43.926
Morgan and Charlie Westbrook.

06:44.028 --> 06:45.571
Nice ceremony.

06:46.322 --> 06:47.782
Thank you for coming.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.416
No, it's not done.

06:57.416 --> 06:59.377
I'll show you tomorrow
when I get o--.

06:59.794 --> 07:00.920
It's open.

07:03.297 --> 07:05.424
It's about time to go on and get dressed.

07:05.424 --> 07:07.969
People gone start arriving in about an hour.

07:08.177 --> 07:08.970
Ok.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.059
Does your mother know

07:15.059 --> 07:17.061
that you talk to boys on facetime?

07:19.856 --> 07:21.566
It's aight to have secrets.

07:22.650 --> 07:24.318
I won't say anything.

07:35.037 --> 07:36.497
Alright, alright.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.792
Got some more franks
coming right up.

07:40.543 --> 07:43.337
Um yeah, but what's up with this chicken.

07:43.504 --> 07:44.255
What do you mean what's up?

07:44.255 --> 07:46.215
I mean it's a lil extra crispy, right?

07:46.215 --> 07:47.133
That's how it's suppose to be.

07:47.133 --> 07:48.718
Naw, this that new Cajun style.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.596
- He talking junk? - Baby, baby, baby

07:51.596 --> 07:53.222
He's talking junk
about you honey.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.182
- He don't know.- He don't know.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.266
- He don't know.- Let's see th--

07:55.266 --> 07:56.976
You right I don't know.

07:56.976 --> 07:57.894
Cause she got my back!

07:57.894 --> 07:58.686
-That's right.
- OK.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.229
And I'm gone have hers later.

08:00.229 --> 08:01.981
Bro, that's too much information.

08:17.413 --> 08:19.540
Um, I need a crispy hotdog

08:19.540 --> 08:22.126
and then we canchange the conversation.

08:23.169 --> 08:25.922
- Well done. - She likes hers well done.

08:27.590 --> 08:30.051
Hi! I brought a gift for the occasion.

08:31.260 --> 08:33.971
Is this Casey's baby shower?

08:33.971 --> 08:36.265
No ma'am, I'm sorry it's not.

08:36.265 --> 08:37.683
- I'm so sorry. I must --.
- It's ok.

08:37.934 --> 08:39.185
Well look, look we got plenty of food,

08:39.185 --> 08:40.311
if you'd like to grab a bite.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.981
I thank you, but I have
to get to Casey.

08:43.981 --> 08:45.066
Thank you so much.

08:46.817 --> 08:47.777
Ok.

08:50.613 --> 08:53.241
And she just walked in the house.

08:53.658 --> 08:54.909
- I don't know. - Who left the do--?

08:54.909 --> 08:56.202
I didn't leave the door open.

08:56.202 --> 08:57.328
Did you leave the door open?

08:57.328 --> 08:59.038
Cause I didn't leave it open.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.540
Alright now Auntie Sherry,
here you go.

09:01.540 --> 09:02.792
Oh yes. Yes, here you go Auntie,

09:02.792 --> 09:03.793
I'm sorry.

09:04.835 --> 09:06.087
Get that extra crispy hotdog.

09:06.087 --> 09:08.923
Hey, hey, that's what I like.

09:11.676 --> 09:14.053
- Thank ya, Thank ya, thank ya.
- Yes ma'am, yes ma'am.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.889
- Enjoy! Bon appÃ©tit. - Figure out who Kasey is.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.558
Should've left that gift!

09:19.558 --> 09:20.768
Alright, let's eat.

09:20.768 --> 09:22.186
Let's eat, let's eat, let's eat.

09:22.186 --> 09:23.020
Let's pray.

09:23.020 --> 09:23.854
Hello?

09:25.231 --> 09:26.941
So you're stalking me now?

09:28.609 --> 09:29.694
Don't forget.

09:30.444 --> 09:31.821
We had an agreement.

09:33.114 --> 09:34.573
But why are you here?

09:34.865 --> 09:36.367
You don't even live here?!

09:38.953 --> 09:40.371
I just want what's mine.

09:41.497 --> 09:42.748
You're crazy!

09:54.385 --> 09:56.470
Send me a picture of those lips.

09:59.181 --> 10:04.312
Or how about I send you what I want from Uber eats

10:04.312 --> 10:05.771
and you can get it for me.

10:07.565 --> 10:09.984
After I get the picture
of my lips.

10:12.737 --> 10:13.904
Hold on a second baby.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.365
Aunt Sherry keeps calling me
back to back. Hold on.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.326
Hey Aunt Sherry everything ok?

10:18.326 --> 10:21.287
There is a bad accident.I'm in bumper to bumper traffic.

10:21.829 --> 10:22.997
- Can you call Lauren's co--.
- Ok, you know what.

10:22.997 --> 10:24.165
Don't even worry about Aunt Sherry;

10:24.165 --> 10:25.166
I can get her.

10:25.166 --> 10:28.836
No. You just started your joband have that probation period.

10:29.170 --> 10:31.714
It's fine Aunt Sherry.I, I didn't take a lunch today,

10:31.714 --> 10:34.425
I work it in. I'll get her,
it's fine. Thank you.

10:35.843 --> 10:36.927
Keep me posted.

10:36.927 --> 10:38.763
I will, and thank you.
I love you.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.056
Thank you Aunt Sherry.

10:40.056 --> 10:41.140
Bye.

10:42.683 --> 10:45.102
I'm literally 10 minutes away.
I can get Lauren.

10:45.603 --> 10:47.438
It's ok baby, I can work it in.

10:47.563 --> 10:49.148
You wouldn't make it in time.

10:49.148 --> 10:51.734
And Sherry is in traffic. It just makes more sense.

10:52.109 --> 10:56.030
Looook babe, Lauren's like a daughter to me.

10:56.030 --> 10:58.908
I hate that you feel uncomfortable asking me that.

10:58.908 --> 11:00.117
You know that, right?

11:01.994 --> 11:04.705
It's just everything's
still so new.

11:05.247 --> 11:07.249
Relax. I got her.

11:11.379 --> 11:12.463
Ok.

11:14.632 --> 11:15.383
Bye.

11:27.853 --> 11:30.064
Hey, I didn't know you were
coming to pick me up!

11:30.064 --> 11:31.982
Me neither.But, I'm glad to though.

11:33.609 --> 11:35.069
Can we go get something to eat?

11:35.069 --> 11:37.029
So, I was thinking we could
order some take out.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.114
Make it a movie night.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.115
What you think about that?

11:39.115 --> 11:40.408
- Ok. - That's cool?

11:40.699 --> 11:42.618
Ahhh, let's go.

12:01.053 --> 12:04.056
Hey, go take a shower and get ready for bed kiddo.

12:05.641 --> 12:06.684
Okay.

13:19.006 --> 13:20.466
Are you looking for Lauren?

13:20.966 --> 13:21.967
Yeah.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.178
I'll send someone to go get her.

13:27.097 --> 13:29.183
She didn't quite seem like herself today.

13:39.068 --> 13:40.110
You don't like it?

13:44.782 --> 13:46.367
You want lemonade or water?

13:51.121 --> 13:52.206
Lauren!

13:52.957 --> 13:53.832
Yes ma'am?

13:54.416 --> 13:56.460
Water or Lemonade?

13:56.961 --> 13:58.379
Lemonade please.

14:15.312 --> 14:16.397
It's open.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.029
Auntie, ooooh.

14:24.029 --> 14:26.282
Looks so good! Smells good.

14:26.282 --> 14:27.408
Let me fix you a plate to go.

14:27.408 --> 14:30.578
No, no. Charlie cooked dinner for us tonight.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.622
I don't know what her problem is today.

14:34.832 --> 14:36.208
What's? Lauren!

14:36.625 --> 14:38.627
Can I stay here tonight please?

14:40.921 --> 14:42.256
What happened?

14:47.136 --> 14:49.179
Did Charlie touch you?!!

14:51.140 --> 14:54.810
- Aunt Sherry -- - Did he touch you?!

15:10.993 --> 15:13.621
Lauren!

15:16.290 --> 15:17.416
Did Charlie touch you?

15:20.669 --> 15:22.796
I'm sorry sweetie.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.965
Sorry sweetheart.

15:25.966 --> 15:27.885
I'm so sorry.

15:34.183 --> 15:35.392
Did Charlie touch your --

15:37.603 --> 15:38.771
Let's just go home.

15:39.271 --> 15:39.980
Alright, let's go home.

15:39.980 --> 15:43.025
We don't ever have to stay here,
stay over there anymore.

15:43.025 --> 15:45.486
We can just go get our stuff,

15:45.486 --> 15:46.695
and then we'll come back to Aunt Sherry's

15:46.695 --> 15:48.072
and talk about it later.

15:48.739 --> 15:49.823
You need me to come with you?

15:49.823 --> 15:51.075
No, no, no.

15:51.075 --> 15:53.744
No. I don't want to cause a scene.

15:53.952 --> 15:55.954
Come on, let's go, let's go.

16:34.243 --> 16:35.661
Long day huh?

16:37.329 --> 16:38.455
I made dinner.

16:38.455 --> 16:40.499
Its plenty left for you and Lauren.

16:42.292 --> 16:44.503
I placed a few bids
on jobs today.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.549
Have to fly out next week to meet with an architect

16:48.549 --> 16:49.800
whose interested in partnering

16:49.800 --> 16:52.344
with contractors on a new subdivision.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.680
It's a 3 year contract.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.728
Yep. It's been a very long day.

17:02.396 --> 17:04.064
I'm going to head to bed.

17:19.496 --> 17:21.874
You psycho piece of shit!"

20:16.715 --> 20:19.259
Wipe that smug look off your face!

20:19.468 --> 20:21.720
There's nothing funny about this situation.

20:21.929 --> 20:24.097
Hey!!! I don't mind domestic disputes, but not in here!

20:25.349 --> 20:28.644
- Where's my money Charlie.
- Hey, I said, outside!

20:32.105 --> 20:34.775
Look man, I make minimum wage.

20:34.775 --> 20:36.735
I'm not looking for no trouble at all.

20:37.486 --> 20:41.114
Y'all take your time, just... don't yell. Please.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.033
Thank you sir.

20:43.533 --> 20:45.535
I don't owe you anything Paula.

20:45.535 --> 20:48.580
I not the one who...
who touched you.

20:49.539 --> 20:50.666
You were there.

20:51.500 --> 20:54.169
You held me down while he raped me. Just as guilty

20:54.544 --> 20:55.671
And I served my time.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.172
You served two months!

20:57.172 --> 20:59.299
Which could have beena 10 year if I had been honest.

21:00.509 --> 21:02.260
So you really sleep at night

21:02.260 --> 21:03.553
knowing that you promised to pay me

21:03.553 --> 21:05.430
if I kept quiet, decades ago?

21:07.015 --> 21:09.184
Knowing that I have
been traumatized

21:09.184 --> 21:12.062
and unable to sexually perform in two of my failed
marriages?

21:12.062 --> 21:13.438
You really sleep at night?

21:13.772 --> 21:17.693
Look Paula, we were teenagers. Babies.

21:18.235 --> 21:19.569
I never touched you.

21:20.070 --> 21:21.738
I only took the fall for him

21:21.738 --> 21:23.323
because he would have been tried as an adult

21:23.323 --> 21:24.700
because of his age.

21:25.367 --> 21:27.786
I still qualified for juvenile court.

21:29.162 --> 21:31.832
It's just the way it played out.

21:32.332 --> 21:33.291
I'm sorry.

21:34.334 --> 21:37.587
- You ruined my life. - No, you ruined your life!

21:39.464 --> 21:43.176
Look Paula, find something better to do with your time.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.344
Move on!

21:46.179 --> 21:47.431
I'm gonna ruin you!

21:50.517 --> 21:51.727
Screw you!

22:21.089 --> 22:22.966
You wanna come havea coffee with me Morgan?

22:24.009 --> 22:26.178
Don't be surprised. I know who you are.

22:27.387 --> 22:29.097
You drove here at your own will, yes?

22:30.974 --> 22:32.267
Do you know Charlie?

22:35.228 --> 22:37.355
Yea, I know Charlie. He's... my husband?

22:38.774 --> 22:40.442
That's not my question, is it?

22:41.985 --> 22:43.487
Do you know him?

22:49.326 --> 22:50.160
It''s ok.

22:51.578 --> 22:53.038
You don''t haveto answer the question,

22:54.081 --> 22:55.832
but I can see you're suspicious,

22:57.876 --> 22:59.711
so here''s what you should reckon with.

23:01.546 --> 23:03.048

43:13.632 --> 43:15.050
Yeah. It never is. Is it?

43:18.721 --> 43:20.389
Man, you got to be more careful!

43:20.389 --> 43:21.974
You scared me for a second.

43:23.976 --> 43:25.728
The plane leaves in two hours.

43:26.312 --> 43:27.271

You coward.

43:33.569 --> 43:35.988
You better stop this shit.

44:29.166 --> 44:31.293
You put a lady in the trunk!

44:59.029 --> 45:00.739
Help get this body out.

46:15.147 --> 46:17.024
Come on, let's finish this.

47:26.635 --> 47:29.429
Hey, I need you to check out
a phone call for me.

47:29.429 --> 47:30.347
Now?

47:30.514 --> 47:32.057
That would be best.

47:32.266 --> 47:34.268
A young lady just called into the stations,

47:34.268 --> 47:36.311
worried about her mother,
may be missing.

47:36.311 --> 47:37.771
Wants us to go check it out.

47:38.272 --> 47:39.648
Her cousin's missing too.

47:39.648 --> 47:41.233
Has it been 24 hours?

47:41.733 --> 47:44.611
No, but we have a tip from an independence source

47:44.611 --> 47:48.115
that there's physical evidence, so we need to investigate.

47:48.574 --> 47:52.369
Ok, if we followed every tip, we would't be efficient here.

47:53.912 --> 47:55.872
Come on, you know these things.

47:55.872 --> 47:57.708
Yes, I do.

47:58.584 --> 48:01.837
But we need to doour due diligence here.

48:39.041 --> 48:41.418
Yes, I need you to do me a favor.

48:41.752 --> 48:44.171
Can you do a house check on a Sherry Brooks.

48:45.505 --> 48:47.341
Mhm. She is 5'9.

48:48.842 --> 48:50.260
No, I'm sorry, Brooks,

48:50.260 --> 48:53.930
Bravo Romeo, Oscar, Oscar, Kilo, Sierra.

49:04.816 --> 49:05.859

Well find it!

49:31.134 --> 49:33.553

49:33.553 --> 49:35.514
We-- You're a cop, aren't you?

49:35.514 --> 49:37.057
What the hell we paying you fo-?

49:41.728 --> 49:43.146
Bad day in paradise huh?

49:44.064 --> 49:45.399
I'll come back.

49:45.649 --> 49:46.775
York!

49:47.901 --> 49:48.985
What'd you need?

49:49.361 --> 49:51.738
Well, I've been reviewing these missing persons case,

49:51.738 --> 49:54.366
and it's awkward.

49:54.825 --> 49:57.494
Awk, awkward, that means nothing.

49:57.494 --> 49:58.495
Ok,

49:58.829 --> 50:02.207
why wouldn't the daughter go back and check for herself?

50:02.749 --> 50:05.085
If I remember,she's in another state.

50:07.629 --> 50:10.215
Ah that. That's not an important detail at all!

50:12.134 --> 50:15.470
Be a competent cop, unlike that idiot.

50:16.805 --> 50:19.599
How does someone getshot in broad day light

50:19.599 --> 50:21.560
and my one and only witness

50:21.560 --> 50:25.063
can not recall a single significant fact?

50:25.230 --> 50:27.149
I mean, it's smack dab in the middle of the street,

50:27.149 --> 50:29.151
in the middle of the goddamn day!

50:30.152 --> 50:34.740
Damn, um I'm gonna get back to the missing persons.

50:34.740 --> 50:35.949
Is there anything else you want me t--?

50:35.949 --> 50:36.950
Go!

50:39.161 --> 50:42.164
Chief, take a chill pill!

50:42.164 --> 50:45.333
- That heart attack of yours --?
- Get Out!

50:52.549 --> 50:54.134

54:23.176 --> 54:25.804

Go, go, go, go!Go, go, go, go!

56:54.244 --> 56:55.161
Officer.

56:55.161 --> 56:56.663
Officer, sir.

56:56.663 --> 56:57.747
Officer.

56:57.747 --> 56:59.415
My husband is following in a black Sudan.

56:59.415 --> 57:00.333
He's a sexual predator.

57:00.333 --> 57:02.168
He's trying to hurt me and my daughter.

57:02.168 --> 57:03.878
- Ok. I, ma'am. - My daughter is bleeding.

57:03.878 --> 57:04.462
- He did this.- I, under----.

57:04.462 --> 57:06.172
Ma'am, I understand, ok.

57:06.172 --> 57:07.173
I need you to calm down.

57:07.173 --> 57:09.217
I need your license and registration.

57:09.217 --> 57:10.093
- Please.
- Ok.

57:10.093 --> 57:11.719
Ok, you're going to be fine.

57:11.719 --> 57:13.054
I just need to reach behind
me to grab my purse.

57:13.054 --> 57:14.013
Sure thing.

57:14.931 --> 57:18.810
Yea, I need to request backup
on Elm and Highway 65.

57:18.810 --> 57:20.186
Suspect pursuit.

57:38.955 --> 57:40.915
Good afternoon, Officer.

57:41.958 --> 57:43.459
Ah, Afternoon.

57:44.836 --> 57:45.753
Do you know these two ladies?

57:45.753 --> 57:48.548
No officer! The question is,
do we know him?!

57:51.301 --> 57:53.469
Yes. That is my wife
and my daughter.

57:54.512 --> 57:57.307
Ok, Imma need you to step back here

57:57.307 --> 57:59.058
for me so I can ask you a few questions.

57:59.058 --> 58:00.393
Ok, sure thing.

58:02.520 --> 58:03.938
What is exactly going on right now?

58:03.938 --> 58:04.856
I don't know officer.

58:04.856 --> 58:08.151
But, there, there's a lot of marks on their bodies.

58:08.151 --> 58:10.653
- Bruises and such. - I, I, I'm not even aware.

58:10.653 --> 58:11.905
It's, it's weird and stupid.

58:11.905 --> 58:14.282
Ok, well as it sits right now,

58:14.282 --> 58:15.783
I'm gonna have to take you
into custody, alright.

58:15.783 --> 58:16.910
I'm gonna need you to put your hands up.

58:16.910 --> 58:18.119
- Oh, wow.
- Yep.

58:18.119 --> 58:20.705
Um, is every- I mean is this necessary?

58:20.705 --> 58:22.207
Unfortunately it is.

58:25.543 --> 58:27.003
Safety precaution and all.

58:28.004 --> 58:28.713
Ok.

58:32.592 --> 58:33.801
Watch your head.

58:45.230 --> 58:48.566
Um, what happened to your arm ma'am?

58:48.566 --> 58:50.026
That's what I was trying to tell you

58:50.026 --> 58:52.695
- when you first came up. - Ma'am, I'm asking her. Ok?

58:52.987 --> 58:54.364
But you don't need to ask her,

58:54.364 --> 58:55.990
- because that's what I'm sa--.
- I'm asking her.

58:55.990 --> 58:58.534
- Officer. You don't understand. - Did your mom do this to
you?

58:59.285 --> 59:01.079
Officer, excuse me, you don't under...

59:01.079 --> 59:01.996
No.

59:03.164 --> 59:05.124
Officer, you havethe wrong, wrong, idea.

59:05.124 --> 59:06.376
I'mma need y'allboth to step out

59:06.376 --> 59:08.044
-because I got to take y'all d--
-No, no, no.

59:08.169 --> 59:09.921
Ma'am. Now!!

59:10.713 --> 59:11.756
Officer!

59:16.052 --> 59:17.011
You have the wrong idea.

59:17.011 --> 59:17.595
- I understand. - It's no--

59:17.595 --> 59:18.680
Do you have anything
in your pockets

59:18.680 --> 59:20.473
that you need, that I need to beware of?

59:21.266 --> 59:21.933
- No. - Alright.

59:21.933 --> 59:24.018
Can you turn around andput your hands behind your back.

59:27.438 --> 59:28.481
I told you it's not me.

59:28.481 --> 59:29.524
You have the wrong id--.

59:29.524 --> 59:30.566
- I'm telling you it's him.
- I understand. I...

59:30.566 --> 59:31.901
Do you haveanything in your pockets

59:31.901 --> 59:32.777
that I need to know about?

59:32.777 --> 59:34.737
- No. No, no, no. - Anything at all?

59:34.737 --> 59:35.863
Alright, I need for youto turn around and place

59:35.863 --> 59:36.739
- your hands behind your back.
- Are you kidding me?

59:36.739 --> 59:38.032
No ma'am, I'm serious.

59:38.283 --> 59:39.242
Please turn around.

59:39.242 --> 59:40.576
Anything in your pockets?

59:40.576 --> 59:42.036
- No. - Please turn around.

59:42.036 --> 59:43.413
Put your hands on the vehicle.

59:44.622 --> 59:45.665
- Ok. - Jens, need back up?

59:45.665 --> 59:46.708
No, no, no.

59:46.708 --> 59:49.127
Nah, it's just a domestic
dispute of some sort.

59:49.127 --> 59:50.545
- It's ok baby. - It's not a big deal.

59:50.545 --> 59:52.171
Should process them
pretty quick.

59:52.422 --> 59:54.507
What was the original reason for the stop?

59:55.049 --> 59:57.844
So, I was headed east bound on 78.

59:57.844 --> 1:00:00.138
She blew past me straight through a stop sign.

1:00:00.138 --> 1:00:01.431
Looks voluntarily to me.

1:00:02.015 --> 1:00:03.182
Voluntarily.

1:00:05.018 --> 1:00:06.311
Interesting.

1:00:06.894 --> 1:00:08.187
This is crazy.

1:00:10.523 --> 1:00:14.193
Hey Jens, what do you say,I take this loser off your hands

1:00:14.193 --> 1:00:16.070
and then you handle
the ladies huh?

1:00:18.448 --> 1:00:20.158
Hmmmm, I mean I'll take care of it.

1:00:20.158 --> 1:00:21.451
It's not that big of a deal.

1:00:21.451 --> 1:00:22.618
No worries.

1:00:25.872 --> 1:00:26.998
It's a shame!

1:00:37.091 --> 1:00:39.052
Oh my God, oh my God. Oh my God.

1:00:39.052 --> 1:00:40.219
- Please. - Ma'am turn around.

1:00:40.219 --> 1:00:40.928
Please, please, please, please.

1:00:40.928 --> 1:00:42.680
- Turn around!! - Ok, ok, ok.

1:00:45.892 --> 1:00:47.060
Have a seat.

1:00:48.019 --> 1:00:49.187
Head.

1:01:04.535 --> 1:01:06.329
Ha ha. What a surprise.

1:01:07.372 --> 1:01:09.290
- Come out. - Alright.

1:03:02.862 --> 1:03:04.864
I'm so sorry Aunt Sherry.

1:03:19.754 --> 1:03:21.881
- It's getting messy.
- I know.

1:03:33.434 --> 1:03:35.645
- Lauren! Lauren! Lauren- Hey! Where you going?

1:03:35.645 --> 1:03:36.771
Come mere.

1:03:37.563 --> 1:03:38.397
Come mere.

1:03:38.397 --> 1:03:39.315
Come mere.

1:03:39.315 --> 1:03:40.608
Get back here! Get back.

1:03:40.608 --> 1:03:41.567
Help!

1:03:42.568 --> 1:03:44.153
Calm down. Stop!

1:03:44.403 --> 1:03:45.530
Calm down!

1:03:45.613 --> 1:03:48.574
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1:03:49.075 --> 1:03:49.867
Stop!

1:04:07.969 --> 1:04:08.928
What the f ---?

1:04:09.262 --> 1:04:10.221
Good morning!

1:04:10.471 --> 1:04:11.264
Morgan.

1:04:11.430 --> 1:04:13.849
Get me out of this damn chair, right now!

1:04:16.936 --> 1:04:18.437
Well, I'm all done!

1:04:20.022 --> 1:04:21.148
Do you hear that?

1:04:21.607 --> 1:04:23.276
The water's already ready.

1:04:24.443 --> 1:04:25.778
Thank you for your help.

1:04:29.073 --> 1:04:30.950
- On to the next one?
- Um huh.

1:04:34.036 --> 1:04:35.997
- Get me out of this chair!- I'll call you when it's done.

1:04:35.997 --> 1:04:37.373
- Ok. - Ok.

1:04:37.748 --> 1:04:38.791
Bye.

1:04:46.465 --> 1:04:48.509
I swear to God Morgan.

1:04:48.801 --> 1:04:50.094
Untie me!

1:04:50.845 --> 1:04:52.096
Untie me.

1:04:53.055 --> 1:04:54.098
Where's Lauren?

1:04:54.098 --> 1:04:55.391
She's safe.

1:04:57.268 --> 1:04:59.478
- Morgan, burning me isn't go--.
- Shhhhhhhh!

1:05:00.771 --> 1:05:01.689
Git ---.

1:05:03.107 --> 1:05:05.151
Charlie have you heard of a Tom?

1:05:05.860 --> 1:05:06.944
Thomas Corbett?

1:05:07.570 --> 1:05:09.030
I know, I didn't think so.

1:05:09.989 --> 1:05:11.490
No worries, I'll tell you!

1:05:12.158 --> 1:05:16.579
So, Thomas Corbett he was a Union Army soldier

1:05:16.579 --> 1:05:18.331
who shot and killed John Booth.

1:05:19.290 --> 1:05:24.378
Now, initially he was arrested
but then he was released

1:05:24.378 --> 1:05:28.257
because the Secretary of War thought he was hero.

1:05:29.842 --> 1:05:36.098
I mean, after all, John Boothwas Abraham Lincoln's assassin.

1:05:37.350 --> 1:05:44.899
So murder for Corbett was ok because Booth was despicable.

1:05:48.527 --> 1:05:51.614
Do you agree with that double standard in the law, Charlie?

1:05:53.532 --> 1:05:55.868
I mean, it's true, if you avenge the weak

1:05:55.868 --> 1:05:58.537
by eliminating the oppressor,

1:05:58.537 --> 1:06:02.875
in some cases, it's called
Imperfect Self-Defense?

1:06:02.875 --> 1:06:05.044
It's actually a legal thing.

1:06:05.878 --> 1:06:07.463
It's a legal thing.

1:06:09.382 --> 1:06:11.592
See, the law's too complicated for me.

1:06:15.096 --> 1:06:16.138
I know. Sorry. I'm sorry

1:06:16.138 --> 1:06:17.139
We got a schedule here.

1:06:17.139 --> 1:06:18.265
- What schedule you--
- Shhhh,

1:06:18.265 --> 1:06:20.601
I'm not finished telling my story!

1:06:21.769 --> 1:06:25.189
So, the interesting
thing about Tom

1:06:25.189 --> 1:06:27.900
was that he became very righteous, right.

1:06:29.568 --> 1:06:32.780
But he also loved prostitutes.

1:06:34.615 --> 1:06:35.574
Go figure.

1:06:36.158 --> 1:06:40.579
So, in order for him to remain clean and, and untainted.

1:06:40.579 --> 1:06:42.748
Holy as he said,

1:06:43.249 --> 1:06:44.667
undistracted,

1:06:47.628 --> 1:06:49.505
he castrated himself.

1:06:49.714 --> 1:06:52.091
I swear to God Morgan!

1:06:52.091 --> 1:06:53.426
Untie me.

1:06:54.427 --> 1:06:57.680
So as a man, he stepped up to the plate,

1:06:59.390 --> 1:07:01.183
realized that he had a problem,

1:07:01.183 --> 1:07:02.810
and did something about it!

1:07:06.439 --> 1:07:08.607
Now, I don't expect the same level of--.

1:07:10.443 --> 1:07:11.902
Oh Charlie.

1:07:13.446 --> 1:07:15.322
You're not paying attention.

1:07:16.073 --> 1:07:17.491
The water getting cold.

1:07:19.326 --> 1:07:20.327
Are you ready?

1:07:20.453 --> 1:07:21.412
It's going to be good.

1:07:21.412 --> 1:07:22.455
It's gonna be good for you.

1:07:22.455 --> 1:07:24.248
It's gonna be good for everyone involved.

1:07:24.248 --> 1:07:26.167
I'll be right back. Trust me. Trust me.

1:07:28.335 --> 1:07:29.712
Morgan!

1:07:29.712 --> 1:07:30.588
What--

1:07:32.465 --> 1:07:34.550
Just get me out of here!

1:07:35.676 --> 1:07:38.345
Shhhhhhh.

1:07:38.345 --> 1:07:40.639
Oh Charlie bear.

1:07:55.321 --> 1:07:56.781
Untie me now!

1:07:58.783 --> 1:08:00.242
Don't yell at me.

1:08:02.077 --> 1:08:03.704
Don't ever yell at me like that.

1:08:07.249 --> 1:08:08.918
Don't yell at me Charlie.

1:08:12.296 --> 1:08:13.506
Just breath.

1:08:14.089 --> 1:08:15.174
Understand?

1:08:15.508 --> 1:08:19.178
Just breath.

1:08:20.763 --> 1:08:21.806
No, no, no.

1:08:22.723 --> 1:08:23.933
Breath.

1:08:28.395 --> 1:08:29.438
Alright.

1:08:31.148 --> 1:08:32.399
Here we go.

1:09:00.052 --> 1:09:01.679
Oh yes.

1:09:39.049 --> 1:09:43.345
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

1:09:43.345 --> 1:09:48.058
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

1:09:50.728 --> 1:09:52.646
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!

1:10:12.750 --> 1:10:14.293
Don't worry, baby.

1:10:14.293 --> 1:10:16.503
it's not as painful
as giving birth!

1:10:26.013 --> 1:10:27.932
911, what's your emergency?
