00:03.378 --> 00:04.629
(* whimsical music *)

00:16.016 --> 00:18.018
(thumping and
laughing)

00:18.059 --> 00:19.310
Gracie? Mia?

00:19.352 --> 00:20.562
What are you kids
doing up there?

00:21.021 --> 00:22.564
(* whimsical music *)

00:28.945 --> 00:30.530
Gracie?

00:30.572 --> 00:31.740
Mia?

00:31.781 --> 00:33.700
(* whimsical music *)

00:46.087 --> 00:48.006
My turkey?!

00:48.048 --> 00:49.632
(phone ringing)

00:49.674 --> 00:50.759
Merry Christmas!

00:50.800 --> 00:52.552
Thanks for calling
the Holiday Hotline.

00:52.594 --> 00:53.720
Holiday Hotline.

00:53.762 --> 00:55.096
Let's talk Turkey!

00:55.138 --> 00:56.097
You did what to your turkey?!

00:56.139 --> 00:57.599
And bless you too.

00:59.184 --> 01:02.145
Okay, it's a long story, but I
can't get it out of the dryer!

01:02.187 --> 01:03.563
(thump)

01:03.605 --> 01:06.524
Oh, so you're saying I was
supposed to remove the bag

01:06.566 --> 01:08.276
before cooking it?

01:08.318 --> 01:09.444
(* cheerful music *)

01:10.779 --> 01:12.364
Well, you see it's, um,

01:12.405 --> 01:15.367
it's...it's stuck on the
end of my hockey stick.

01:16.368 --> 01:18.078
Abby: The Holiday Hotline.

01:18.119 --> 01:20.288
Every year, between
Thanksgiving and Christmas,

01:20.330 --> 01:23.249
these poultry professionals
calm the nerves of over

01:23.291 --> 01:25.919
100,000 turkey first-timers.

01:25.960 --> 01:29.005
Sure, they could google it, but
there's nothing like talking

01:29.047 --> 01:31.132
to a real live person.

01:31.174 --> 01:33.009
Okay, alright.

01:33.051 --> 01:34.302
Just take a deep breath.

01:34.344 --> 01:36.262
We're going to get
through this together.

01:36.304 --> 01:40.058
Abby: And speaking of real
people, that's me, Abby Mitchel,

01:40.100 --> 01:41.976
after a month in America.

01:42.018 --> 01:43.061
Yes, ma'am.

01:43.103 --> 01:44.145
My name is Peggy.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.772
Let's talk turkey!

01:45.814 --> 01:47.482
Abby: Well, "sort of" me.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.192
You might be wondering
how Abby could be

01:49.234 --> 01:51.152
the same person as Peggy.

01:51.194 --> 01:53.530
Well, it all started
back in England,

01:53.571 --> 01:56.533
with some delicious
Yorkshire puddings.

01:56.574 --> 01:58.618
My delicious
Yorkshire puddings!

01:58.660 --> 01:59.786
No, Jason.

01:59.828 --> 02:01.037
That's where
you're wrong.

02:01.079 --> 02:02.455
They're MY
Yorkshire puddings.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.498
Unbelievable.

02:03.540 --> 02:05.083
Abby, darling,
what are you doing?

02:05.125 --> 02:06.418
I read the
article, Jason.

02:06.459 --> 02:08.461
They gave the restaurant
a wonderful review.

02:08.503 --> 02:11.464
Maybe you've forgotten, but I
created that Yorkshire pudding.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.299
It put this place
on the map.

02:13.341 --> 02:15.468
And you didn't even
bother to mention my name.

02:15.510 --> 02:17.679
Abby, darling, that
was an oversight, luv.

02:17.721 --> 02:18.680
I don't think so.

02:19.639 --> 02:20.598
You used me.

02:20.640 --> 02:21.641
You took credit
for the pudding

02:21.683 --> 02:23.393
and every other dish
I created here.

02:23.435 --> 02:24.728
Abby.

02:24.769 --> 02:28.148
When I first started here
six, no, seven years ago,

02:28.189 --> 02:30.108
you promised you'd
make me a head chef.

02:30.150 --> 02:31.484
And you still
could be.

02:31.526 --> 02:32.861
No.

02:32.902 --> 02:34.654
It's not just the article,
Jason, it's how you operate.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.406
You're not
trustworthy.

02:36.448 --> 02:39.826
If you really loved me, you
wouldn't take advantage of me.

02:39.868 --> 02:41.536
Please, darling,
please.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.705
Stop.

02:43.747 --> 02:45.331
Look, you're right.

02:45.373 --> 02:47.500
I should have given you more
credit, but it's complicated.

02:47.542 --> 02:50.128
I mean the public wants
to believe that...

02:50.170 --> 02:55.091
(phone ringing)

02:55.133 --> 02:56.134
(exhale)

02:56.176 --> 02:57.427
(phone ringing)

02:57.469 --> 02:59.804
But Abby, that, that's
not what it looks like.

02:59.846 --> 03:01.514
Really?

03:01.556 --> 03:03.975
I thought you were done
with that kind of thing.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.268
I can explain.

03:05.310 --> 03:06.853
I don't think so.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.606
Betrayed me in work and
you betrayed me in love.

03:09.647 --> 03:11.441
I'm done.

03:11.483 --> 03:12.609
I quit.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.528
I quit you and everything
that goes with it.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.365
Abby: And just like that, seven
years as a sous chef in one of

03:18.406 --> 03:21.201
London's finest restaurants,
most of which were in a rocky

03:21.242 --> 03:23.203
relationship, were
tossed in the rubbish,

03:23.244 --> 03:25.205
like a tray of
Yorkshire pudding.

03:25.246 --> 03:27.540
Of course, I was devastated.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.585
Fortunately for me, my Mum
and Dad had just the remedy.

03:30.627 --> 03:32.545
Almost there, keep
your eyes closed.

03:32.587 --> 03:33.880
Oh, no, no.

03:33.922 --> 03:37.258
Okay, ready and, okay, okay,
stay there, stand there.

03:39.344 --> 03:41.554
Open your eyes.

03:41.596 --> 03:43.390
Happy Christmas!
Happy Christmas!

03:43.431 --> 03:45.475
But, it's November.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.185
We know how much
you love Christmas,

03:47.227 --> 03:49.229
so we decided to
celebrate early.

03:49.270 --> 03:51.272
We thought it might
help cheer you up.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.149
And since you won't be
home for the holidays...

03:53.191 --> 03:54.442
I won't?

03:54.484 --> 03:56.403
Archie, you're gonna
ruin the surprise!
Not me.

03:58.279 --> 03:59.989
Merry Christmas,
sweetie.

04:00.031 --> 04:01.783
What's this?

04:01.825 --> 04:04.077
You're going
to Chicago!

04:04.119 --> 04:07.539
Aunt Dorene just moved to a
retirement village in Florida.

04:07.580 --> 04:10.375
And her Chicago place is
just sitting empty until

04:10.417 --> 04:12.377
it goes on the
market in January.

04:12.419 --> 04:14.546
We thought a change
would do you good.

04:14.587 --> 04:16.923
And get your mind off
the restaurant business.

04:16.965 --> 04:19.843
And off that ridiculously
handsome chef.
Diane.

04:19.884 --> 04:21.428
What?
He is handsome.

04:21.469 --> 04:24.055
Well, even if
he's a bit dodgy.

04:24.097 --> 04:25.473
I guess you're right.

04:25.515 --> 04:27.434
I could use
some time away.

04:27.475 --> 04:30.353
That's right!
Regroup.

04:30.395 --> 04:32.522
Get a fresh
perspective.

04:32.564 --> 04:35.358
Out with the old,
in with the new.

04:35.400 --> 04:38.695
The sun will come
up tomorrow.

04:38.737 --> 04:40.655
Seat of honour.

04:40.697 --> 04:43.450
(sigh)

04:43.491 --> 04:44.576
Don't worry,
darling.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.453
You will still be a
head chef someday.

04:46.494 --> 04:48.288
I highly doubt that.

04:48.329 --> 04:51.750
Truly, the last thing I want
to do right now is cook.

04:51.791 --> 04:55.086
It only reminds me of him
and all the time I wasted,

04:55.128 --> 04:57.339
and heartache.

04:58.590 --> 05:02.052
If I even make toast in the
next year, it'll be too soon.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.553
Don't be daft.

05:03.595 --> 05:06.222
All you need is
a fresh start.

05:06.264 --> 05:08.308
Happy Christmas!

05:08.350 --> 05:10.143
Happy Christmas!

05:10.185 --> 05:13.480
Alright, to a
new adventure!

05:13.521 --> 05:15.607
Anything
without cooking!

05:17.275 --> 05:18.485
(clink)
Bon Appetit!

05:18.526 --> 05:19.944
(* mellow music *)

05:25.408 --> 05:27.452
That bad, huh?

05:27.494 --> 05:29.329
You should have
used the Slow Cooker.

05:29.371 --> 05:30.580
Yeah, well, the
thing's busted.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.499
But the oven
should've worked fine.

05:32.540 --> 05:34.167
I mean its chicken.

05:34.209 --> 05:35.502
How hard can it be?

05:35.543 --> 05:37.379
(bang, bang, bang)

05:37.420 --> 05:39.089
That hard, huh?

05:39.130 --> 05:42.133
Okay, we're
ordering in.

05:42.175 --> 05:44.511
Uhhh.

05:44.552 --> 05:50.016
Alright, pick a
menu, any menu.

05:50.058 --> 05:51.685
Italian!

05:51.726 --> 05:53.103
Wise choice.

05:56.439 --> 05:59.234
Hey, Gina, it's...yep.

05:59.275 --> 06:00.610
Yeah.

06:00.652 --> 06:03.154
Yeah, and a side of...yup.

06:03.196 --> 06:05.365
With extra, yeah.

06:05.407 --> 06:07.117
Okay, great.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.538
Okay, what do you say we get
started on your homework

06:11.579 --> 06:13.206
while we wait, hmm?

06:13.248 --> 06:14.874
How about we
do it later?

06:14.916 --> 06:17.961
It's hard to think
on an empty stomach.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.587
Nice try.

06:22.257 --> 06:23.717
Holiday worksheet.

06:23.758 --> 06:25.051
What's this?

06:25.093 --> 06:26.720
Some dumb essay
I have to write.

06:26.761 --> 06:28.096
Not so dumb.

06:28.138 --> 06:29.472
What's your
favorite holiday?

06:29.514 --> 06:32.350
Duh, Christmas,
of course.
Duh.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.060
And what's your
favorite tradition?

06:34.102 --> 06:35.437
I don't know.
It doesn't matter.

06:36.438 --> 06:38.106
What do you mean,
'it doesn't matter'?

06:38.148 --> 06:39.441
C'mon, spill.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.526
Well, I like to write
about Christmas dinner.

06:41.568 --> 06:43.403
But we don't do
that anymore.

06:43.445 --> 06:44.904
Sure, we do.
We go to Gramma's.

06:44.946 --> 06:47.282
It's not the same as
doing it at our house.

06:47.323 --> 06:50.076
I remember how it
used to feel here.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.078
It was way better
at home, Dad.

06:52.120 --> 06:54.622
I know it was.

06:54.664 --> 06:58.001
But your mom was a
really great cook,

06:58.043 --> 07:01.421
and she was great at planning,
and great at decorating

07:01.463 --> 07:04.257
the table, and well,
pretty much everything.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.343
You could do all that.

07:06.384 --> 07:09.429
I can't even make a
chicken leg, sweetie.

07:09.471 --> 07:13.141
And I'm pretty sure you can't
make a turkey in a Slow Cooker.

07:14.976 --> 07:18.021
What do you say we hold off
on this essay for now, huh?

07:18.063 --> 07:20.440
It's okay, I can write
about opening presents.

07:20.482 --> 07:23.401
No, no, I'm gonna
figure it out.

07:23.443 --> 07:26.404
I am sure I can
do a turkey.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.449
I mean, I'm
pretty sure.

07:29.491 --> 07:31.117
Pretty sure?
Yeah.

07:31.159 --> 07:32.619
You okay to wait?

07:33.161 --> 07:34.454
Okay.

07:34.496 --> 07:35.622
(* uplifting music *)

07:55.600 --> 07:56.643
(* melodic music *)

08:01.147 --> 08:03.108
Oh, thank you so much.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.025
(* melodic music *)

08:05.402 --> 08:06.695
Hey, Jack, let's go.

08:06.736 --> 08:09.030
We need to be in Wicker
Park in twenty minutes.

08:09.072 --> 08:10.031
(* melodic music *)

08:10.323 --> 08:12.117
Jack?

08:12.158 --> 08:13.535
You okay?

08:15.120 --> 08:17.414
I've decided to have Christmas
dinner at our house this year.

08:17.455 --> 08:18.665
Okay.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.500
First off, it's not
even Thanksgiving yet,

08:20.542 --> 08:23.003
and secondly and much
more importantly,

08:23.044 --> 08:24.295
you can't boil water.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.006
Uh, well, I can learn.

08:26.047 --> 08:27.674
We're gonna have a big
Christmas dinner at the house

08:27.716 --> 08:29.551
just like we used to
before Nikki died.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.011
Jessica deserves it.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.178
We both do.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.930
Okay, well, good
luck with that.

08:33.972 --> 08:36.391
Oh, do you want me to
order Chinese now

08:36.433 --> 08:38.184
or wait until
Christmas?

08:38.226 --> 08:39.394
You're fired.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.187
You can't fire me,
I'm your brother.

08:41.229 --> 08:42.689
My name is
on the wall.

08:42.731 --> 08:45.692
Look, all I'm saying is that
cooking a turkey dinner

08:45.734 --> 08:48.028
is a big hill to
climb for anybody.

08:48.069 --> 08:50.363
Why don't you give yourself
a break and take Jessica

08:50.405 --> 08:52.032
to moms for
Christmas dinner?

08:52.073 --> 08:54.576
Because it's not her
home, that's why.

08:54.617 --> 08:55.785
(tap, tap)

08:58.455 --> 09:06.171
(gasping)

09:06.212 --> 09:07.881
Oh, excuse me, hello.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.257
I'm sorry to
bother you.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.217
But where might I
find the lift?

09:11.259 --> 09:14.387
Oooh, a British accent!

09:14.429 --> 09:16.264
Are you Abigail?

09:16.306 --> 09:17.182
The chef?

09:17.223 --> 09:18.099
I am.

09:18.141 --> 09:19.726
But please
call me Abby.

09:19.768 --> 09:23.855
Well, Abby, if you're
for an elevator...

09:23.897 --> 09:25.398
Nothing but
stairs here.

09:25.440 --> 09:27.233
Oh, dear.

09:27.275 --> 09:28.902
I'm Margaret.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.571
Your great-aunt Dorene told
me "The British Were Coming!"

09:31.613 --> 09:32.947
You're in 16.

09:32.989 --> 09:34.574
I'm just down
from you in 17.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.659
Anything you need,
you just come on over.

09:36.701 --> 09:38.078
But don't ring
the doorbell.

09:38.119 --> 09:40.038
It's like nails on a
chalkboard for my hearing aid.

09:40.080 --> 09:42.290
I won't.
Let me help you
with your bags.

09:42.332 --> 09:46.086
Oh, no.
I've lived here for
fifty years, young lady.

09:46.127 --> 09:50.590
And I may not look it but I am,
as my grandkids say, "ripped".

09:50.632 --> 09:54.052
But still, I can't...
Too late!

09:54.094 --> 09:55.387
Uh.

09:56.304 --> 09:58.098
Hang on!

09:58.139 --> 10:00.517
(gasping)

10:00.558 --> 10:01.976
Right behind you!

10:03.061 --> 10:04.479
I just hope this doesn't
take too long, hon,

10:04.521 --> 10:05.980
my shift starts at
eleven tonight

10:06.022 --> 10:07.273
and I still
haven't slept.

10:07.315 --> 10:08.316
Don't worry.

10:08.358 --> 10:09.859
It'll be quick.

10:09.901 --> 10:13.113
But once the restorations start,
it's gonna be a mess in there.

10:13.154 --> 10:15.156
Well, I guess that means
I'll just have to spend

10:15.198 --> 10:16.324
more time at
your place.

10:16.366 --> 10:18.660
See, there's a silver
lining to everything.

10:18.702 --> 10:21.079
And when Jack and I are
done with this place,

10:21.121 --> 10:24.165
it is going to be so beautiful
you're not gonna want to leave.

10:24.207 --> 10:25.709
Oh, well maybe I'll
call off the engagement

10:25.750 --> 10:27.335
just so I can
stay here.

10:27.377 --> 10:29.629
You know, I'm starting to
wonder if you said 'yes'

10:29.671 --> 10:31.589
just for my
architectural skills.

10:31.631 --> 10:33.341
Oh, but you
know I did.

10:34.676 --> 10:36.136
(mwah)

10:37.512 --> 10:39.139
Kissing the client?

10:39.180 --> 10:40.807
Very unprofessional.

10:40.849 --> 10:43.184
How about you
measure the suite?

10:43.226 --> 10:45.353
And Erica will show
me the boiler room.

10:45.395 --> 10:48.565
Don't worry, I promise to be
the ultimate professional.

10:48.606 --> 10:51.026
(laughs)

10:51.067 --> 10:52.485
Right.

10:52.527 --> 10:53.445
(* melodic music *)

10:56.740 --> 10:59.159
Dorene said something
about you working for a posh

10:59.200 --> 11:00.535
restaurant in London.

11:00.577 --> 11:01.536
(gasping)

11:01.578 --> 11:02.996
Oh, hi.

11:03.038 --> 11:05.874
Yes, four years at the Royal
Academy of Culinary Arts,

11:05.915 --> 11:08.084
and seven in
fine dining.

11:08.126 --> 11:10.587
All sorts of complex
dishes, I would imagine.

11:10.628 --> 11:14.632
Cornish Hen, Jellied
Eels, Beef Wellington?

11:14.674 --> 11:15.967
The gamut, yes.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.510
And now you're
making me hungry!

11:17.552 --> 11:19.471
I can break a
twenty if needed.

11:19.512 --> 11:22.349
Oh, uh, let me
see what I have.

11:22.390 --> 11:24.100
I'm just
kidding, dear.

11:24.142 --> 11:25.518
It's on the house.

11:25.560 --> 11:27.771
And welcome
to Chicago.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.026
Right.

11:33.068 --> 11:39.491
(pounding)

11:39.532 --> 11:40.784
Do you need some help?

11:40.825 --> 11:43.578
Um, no, I, I think I've
got it sorted, thank you.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.413
(clank)

11:45.455 --> 11:46.664
Oh!

11:46.706 --> 11:47.916
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa!

11:47.957 --> 11:49.542
What have you done?

11:49.584 --> 11:52.545
Um, it's just a
door handle.

11:52.587 --> 11:53.713
It can be fixed.

11:53.755 --> 11:55.423
No, it can't.

11:55.465 --> 11:56.925
It's original to
the building.

11:56.966 --> 11:59.010
It's irreplaceable.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.429
I'm sorry, I'm a little
confused as to why you have

12:01.471 --> 12:03.390
any concern
about my door.

12:03.431 --> 12:05.058
Do you own
the building?

12:05.100 --> 12:07.143
No, no, I'm the architect
who's gonna be restoring

12:07.185 --> 12:09.104
the apartments over
the next few years.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.231
I don't think you
understand...

12:11.272 --> 12:13.566
you just broke a
piece of history.

12:13.608 --> 12:15.485
I'll find a
replacement.

12:15.527 --> 12:18.947
And for the record, I understand
the value of old things.

12:18.988 --> 12:21.741
Where I'm from, this building
is practically brand new.

12:21.783 --> 12:23.410
Huh, if I had a nickel
for every time someone

12:23.451 --> 12:24.619
from Europe
said that...

12:24.661 --> 12:26.287
Hey, hey, hey there.

12:26.329 --> 12:30.208
Hi, I'm Mike, and this
is Erica, my finance.

12:30.250 --> 12:31.626
Hi, I live just
down the hall.

12:31.668 --> 12:32.669
I'm Abby.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.004
Nice to meet you.

12:34.045 --> 12:35.505
I'll be your new
neighbor for a while.

12:35.547 --> 12:37.132
Oh great.

12:37.173 --> 12:38.341
If I can get in.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.676
Oh, don't worry, we'll
help you get inside.

12:39.718 --> 12:41.428
So, what happened?

12:41.469 --> 12:43.179
Disaster happened.

12:43.221 --> 12:44.389
Seriously?

12:45.140 --> 12:47.434
Ah, this is my
brother Jack.

12:47.475 --> 12:48.476
Oh, we've met.

12:50.020 --> 12:52.605
Don't worry, we'll find another
one somewhere in the city.

12:52.647 --> 12:55.025
It's just gonna
take a little time.

12:55.066 --> 12:57.569
What a measured,
appropriate response.

12:57.610 --> 12:59.112
Thank you.
(clunk)

12:59.154 --> 13:00.447
Oh!

13:02.032 --> 13:04.159
Know any good
locksmiths?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.328
You didn't have to be so prickly
with Erica's new neighbor.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.955
I wasn't prickly.

13:08.997 --> 13:10.331
Everything in that
building is priceless.

13:10.373 --> 13:12.125
She shouldn't have been
yanking on the door handle.

13:12.167 --> 13:14.502
C'mon, we know this has nothing
to do with the door handle.

13:14.544 --> 13:16.129
What's up?

13:16.171 --> 13:17.630
I don't know.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.299
I guess I'm just
worried about Jessica

13:19.341 --> 13:21.343
and making Christmas
normal for her again.

13:22.677 --> 13:24.137
I have to get our
lives back on track.

13:24.179 --> 13:26.598
I'm not sure I can pull it
off the same way Nikki did.

13:26.639 --> 13:28.975
Maybe you're being a little
too hard on yourself.

13:29.017 --> 13:31.186
Are you sure you can
go through with this?

13:31.227 --> 13:32.395
Well, I have to,

13:32.437 --> 13:33.521
now that I realize how
important it is for her.

13:33.563 --> 13:34.689
You know, I've
been thinking, too,

13:34.731 --> 13:36.399
Thanksgiving is
only two days away.

13:36.441 --> 13:38.943
I can start by making a "trial
turkey", and bring it over

13:38.985 --> 13:40.362
to mom and dads for
Thanksgiving, huh.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.614
Oh, boy. That sounds
like a recipe for disaster.

13:42.655 --> 13:44.199
Pun definitely intended.

13:44.240 --> 13:46.242
C'mon, have a little
faith in your brother.

13:46.284 --> 13:48.495
It's a turkey, how
hard could it be, huh?

13:48.536 --> 13:49.579
And this coming
from the brother

13:49.621 --> 13:50.997
who couldn't even
toast a pop tart.

13:51.039 --> 13:54.125
I'm telling you, Mikey, I am
gonna step up to the plate

13:54.167 --> 13:57.170
and make Christmas dinner,
at home, for Jessica.

13:57.212 --> 14:00.548
I've got to swing for the
fences this year, man.
Okay, okay.

14:00.590 --> 14:03.510
Move over Gordon Ramsey,
there's a new cook in town.

14:03.551 --> 14:04.928
(laughs)

14:04.969 --> 14:06.388
(* melodic music *)

14:15.563 --> 14:17.232
Abby!
Oh, Margaret!

14:17.273 --> 14:18.191
Good morning.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.110
I'm so glad I
ran into you.

14:20.151 --> 14:22.112
I'm in a bit
of a pickle.
A pickle?

14:22.153 --> 14:23.863
Yeah, you see
I'm new at this.

14:23.905 --> 14:29.035
I got a thirteen-pound turkey,
and Thanksgiving is tomorrow.
Oh.

14:29.077 --> 14:30.328
I'm so glad
you're here.

14:30.370 --> 14:32.247
So, what should
I cook it at?

14:32.288 --> 14:35.208
In a regular oven,
162 Celsius.

14:35.250 --> 14:38.336
I mean 325 Fahrenheit for
three and a half hours.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.506
Basting?
Basting is fine, for an
elementary approach,

14:41.548 --> 14:44.509
but you risk losing conduction
heat with each oven intrusion,

14:44.551 --> 14:47.429
never mind that a herb-butter
browns just the same.

14:47.470 --> 14:51.057
To brine or
not to brine?
Easy question.

14:51.099 --> 14:53.268
It's a "no briner".

14:53.309 --> 14:55.270
Sorry, bad joke.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.564
Definitely brine.
You're so helpful.

14:57.605 --> 14:59.190
And good.

14:59.232 --> 15:01.443
Even better than
I expected.

15:03.028 --> 15:04.112
(* melodic music *)

15:09.325 --> 15:10.952
What's that?

15:10.994 --> 15:14.998
That is the turkey I'm
making for Thanksgiving.

15:15.040 --> 15:16.958
You're making
a turkey?

15:17.000 --> 15:18.501
What about gramma?

15:18.543 --> 15:21.338
She's getting
the day off.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.255
(thump)

15:22.297 --> 15:24.299
It's as hard as
a rock, Dad.

15:24.341 --> 15:25.925
Doesn't it need
time to thaw?

15:25.967 --> 15:28.428
Right, yeah.

15:28.470 --> 15:30.930
I'm sure you're right,
and I'm gonna get to that,

15:30.972 --> 15:32.640
right after breakfast.

15:34.809 --> 15:38.605
Uh, cottage
cheese and fruit.

15:41.024 --> 15:42.359
Save some for me.

15:44.444 --> 15:47.364
You're new in town, so you're
probably looking for a job?

15:47.405 --> 15:49.115
Oh, not really.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.159
Well, you're in luck because
who doesn't need a little

15:51.201 --> 15:53.203
extra cash around
the holidays?

15:53.244 --> 15:55.455
That's lovely, Margaret,
but I'm not sure.

15:55.497 --> 15:56.706
It's the perfect job!

15:56.748 --> 16:00.043
Seasonal, part-time, and
you need to know someone

16:00.085 --> 16:01.086
to get your foot
in the door.

16:01.127 --> 16:02.170
But I'm not
looking for...

16:02.212 --> 16:04.255
It's the
Holiday Hotline.

16:06.508 --> 16:09.302
Let's talk Turkey!

16:09.344 --> 16:11.638
I don't suppose you
have that in England.

16:11.680 --> 16:15.100
Here, it's where folks from all
over the country call for help

16:15.141 --> 16:17.060
with their
holiday turkeys.

16:17.102 --> 16:19.479
And people talk
them through it?

16:19.521 --> 16:20.939
Oh, not just "people".

16:20.980 --> 16:22.982
Experts like
you and me.

16:23.024 --> 16:25.193
But I thought you were
cooking your first turkey.

16:25.235 --> 16:26.986
Sorry, but that
was a test.

16:27.028 --> 16:28.947
I had to make sure
you were up to it.

16:28.988 --> 16:31.533
Okay, I don't
quite understand.

16:31.574 --> 16:35.370
I promised my family I'd show
up for Thanksgiving this year

16:35.412 --> 16:38.248
and the grandkids
are counting on it.

16:38.289 --> 16:40.583
So, please, keep it
on the hush-hush.

16:40.625 --> 16:42.127
Hush-hush?

16:42.168 --> 16:44.838
Some of the other ladies in the
building have been begging for

16:44.879 --> 16:48.466
a spot on the hotline for years,
bribing me with baked goods.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.218
Don't want the
gravy train to stop.

16:50.260 --> 16:51.886
Got me?
But, Margaret...

16:51.928 --> 16:52.971
That's right.

16:53.013 --> 16:54.639
I need a sub
starting today.

16:54.681 --> 16:56.683
I need you!

16:56.725 --> 16:57.642
(* melodic music *)

17:03.356 --> 17:05.442
Holiday Hotline,
let's talk turkey.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.652
Yeah, Margaret told me you
were very enthusiastic

17:07.694 --> 17:09.446
about taking
the job.

17:09.487 --> 17:11.614
Well, actually I only
agreed because she seemed

17:11.656 --> 17:13.533
so terribly
desperate.

17:13.575 --> 17:15.368
(laughs)

17:15.410 --> 17:16.369
That's rich.

17:16.411 --> 17:17.746
Oh, Margaret said
you were a ringer.

17:17.787 --> 17:19.706
And for a Brit, it seems
like you really know your way

17:19.748 --> 17:21.416
around a
Thanksgiving turkey.

17:21.458 --> 17:22.709
Thanks, Roger.

17:22.751 --> 17:24.169
My mother's
American, actually.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.129
So, Thanksgiving's always
been a special time for us.

17:26.171 --> 17:28.381
And we are
thankful for that!

17:28.423 --> 17:30.425
Here you go.

17:32.093 --> 17:35.180
Okay, it's
showtime!

17:35.221 --> 17:39.225
You're live in
five, four, three...

17:43.104 --> 17:44.481
Isn't that a TV thing?

17:45.231 --> 17:47.317
Could you just let
me have my fun?

17:47.359 --> 17:48.693
(laughs)

17:48.735 --> 17:50.278
Okay.

17:51.988 --> 17:54.366
Holiday Hotline,
let's talk turkey.

17:55.033 --> 17:56.409
I don't know.

17:56.451 --> 17:58.036
My mother-in-law told me to
keep the plastic wrapping

17:58.078 --> 18:00.330
on the turkey, to
seal in the juices.

18:00.372 --> 18:02.582
Does your mother-in-law,
by chance,

18:02.624 --> 18:04.584
have her knickers in a knot
because you're hosting

18:04.626 --> 18:07.087
Thanksgiving this
year instead of her?

18:07.128 --> 18:09.047
Her what in
a what-now?

18:09.089 --> 18:10.548
Oh, sorry.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.343
Do you think that could be why
she's giving you bad advice?

18:13.385 --> 18:15.053
Maybe.

18:15.095 --> 18:17.097
I hadn't thought
of that.

18:17.138 --> 18:20.350
Thank you.

18:23.728 --> 18:24.729
(* whimsical music *)

18:30.652 --> 18:31.945
(ding-ding)

18:31.986 --> 18:34.739
How long does a twenty-pound
turkey take to thaw?

18:34.781 --> 18:36.491
(ding-ding)

18:36.533 --> 18:38.159
What?!

18:39.327 --> 18:42.288
Holiday Hotline,
let's talk turkey.

18:42.330 --> 18:45.083
Can I defrost my turkey on
the roof rack of my car?

18:45.125 --> 18:47.377
I'm driving from
Kenosha to Kalamazoo.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.380
Hello, are you
still there?

18:50.422 --> 18:51.631
(* whimsical music *)

18:53.049 --> 18:56.636
Can the electric blanket be
on 'high' all night long?

18:58.555 --> 18:59.681
Pardon?

19:01.516 --> 19:04.477
I'm not sure if my turkey's
going to be ready in time.

19:04.519 --> 19:07.188
What state is
your turkey in?

19:07.981 --> 19:09.107
Florida.

19:09.149 --> 19:10.692
(water splashing)

19:11.484 --> 19:12.944
(* melodic music *)

19:17.282 --> 19:18.700
(* lighthearted music *)

19:23.204 --> 19:25.498
Oh no!

19:25.540 --> 19:26.666
(grunting)

19:26.708 --> 19:27.917
(thump)

19:35.216 --> 19:37.052
Is this a bad time?

19:37.093 --> 19:38.678
Hmm.

19:43.725 --> 19:44.893
Ahhh.

19:46.353 --> 19:48.521
Yes, I am
from England.

19:48.563 --> 19:50.857
Defrost in the refrigerator.

19:50.899 --> 19:53.068
No, we don't do Thanksgiving
there, but I can-

19:53.109 --> 19:54.569
(dial tone)

19:54.611 --> 19:56.613
Happy Thanksgiving
to you, too.

19:56.654 --> 19:58.615
(phone ringing)

19:58.656 --> 20:00.367
Turkey trouble?

20:00.408 --> 20:03.078
They don't think the British
know how to cook turkey.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.330
Maybe I should just
use an American accent.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.207
Would make this
a lot easier.

20:07.248 --> 20:08.541
You can do that?

20:08.583 --> 20:09.626
Of course!

20:09.668 --> 20:10.585
My mom's American.

20:10.627 --> 20:11.920
Watch this.

20:13.505 --> 20:15.256
Thanks for calling
the Holiday Hotline.

20:15.298 --> 20:17.467
My name is...

20:18.259 --> 20:19.552
(dial tone)

20:19.594 --> 20:21.262
What should my
American name be?

20:21.304 --> 20:23.098
What's wrong
with Abby?

20:23.139 --> 20:24.557
I'm getting
into character.

20:24.599 --> 20:25.600
Oh, okay.

20:25.642 --> 20:27.185
Well, you're filling
for Margaret,

20:27.227 --> 20:29.604
so Madge, Maggy, Peggy.

20:29.646 --> 20:31.398
Peggy, perfect!

20:32.399 --> 20:33.942
(* whimsical music *)

20:33.983 --> 20:35.276
...Peggy.

20:35.318 --> 20:36.736
Let's talk turkey.

20:36.778 --> 20:39.989
Hi, um,
this is John.

20:40.031 --> 20:41.616
(ding-ding)

20:41.658 --> 20:42.742
John?

20:42.784 --> 20:44.035
What?

20:44.077 --> 20:45.495
That is my
given name.

20:45.537 --> 20:47.247
I'm talking to
a stranger.

20:47.288 --> 20:48.707
Do you let strangers
call you Mikey?

20:48.748 --> 20:51.126
I never understood how
anybody gets Jack from John

20:51.167 --> 20:52.419
in the first place.

20:53.795 --> 20:55.171
(ding-ding)

20:55.213 --> 20:57.090
How can I help
you today, John?

20:57.132 --> 20:58.925
Well, how much
time do you have?

20:58.967 --> 21:01.344
Well, as long
as it takes.

21:01.386 --> 21:03.596
So, why don't we start
at the beginning?

21:03.638 --> 21:05.640
I assume you're having
turkey troubles.

21:05.682 --> 21:08.309
Well, the trouble started
long before the turkey,

21:08.351 --> 21:10.437
but that's a good
place to start.

21:10.478 --> 21:11.980
What's the
problem?

21:12.022 --> 21:14.941
Well, I have a twenty-pound
turkey and it's frozen solid.

21:14.983 --> 21:17.318
Okay, sounds like
you're feeding an army.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.195
When do you need it?

21:19.237 --> 21:22.449
Technically for Thanksgiving,
tomorrow night.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.451
But I thought
I'd start early.

21:24.492 --> 21:27.037
And I don't want to
"fowl" this one up.

21:27.078 --> 21:29.164
(laughs)

21:29.205 --> 21:33.168
Um, sorry, that joke didn't
deserve the reaction it got.

21:33.209 --> 21:34.502
Apologies.

21:34.544 --> 21:36.129
Um, that was
a dad joke.

21:36.171 --> 21:37.339
My daughter would
be mortified.

21:37.380 --> 21:39.215
I'll allow it.

21:39.257 --> 21:41.134
I bet your daughter is
proud of her father

21:41.176 --> 21:42.719
for taking on the
turkey duties.

21:45.513 --> 21:50.018
Yeah, well, that's the thing,
actually I'm struggling here

21:50.060 --> 21:54.314
because I, I just...I want
to show her I can do this,

21:54.356 --> 21:55.940
you know.

21:55.982 --> 21:59.235
This is a test to see if we can
host Christmas dinner here,

21:59.277 --> 22:01.404
like before.

22:01.446 --> 22:04.324
Does mom usually
do the cooking?

22:04.366 --> 22:07.243
She used to.

22:07.285 --> 22:09.954
Oh, I'm sorry.

22:11.164 --> 22:13.583
No, that's okay.

22:13.625 --> 22:19.130
She, um, she's not
with us anymore.

22:19.172 --> 22:21.341
I'm so sorry.

22:21.383 --> 22:22.550
(* heartfelt music *)

22:28.139 --> 22:30.266
John?

22:30.308 --> 22:32.560
John, are you
still there?

22:32.602 --> 22:38.566
Yeah, um, I think I
need to go actually.

22:38.608 --> 22:40.527
Sorry to waste
your time.

22:43.655 --> 22:44.364
But I-

22:44.406 --> 22:45.949
(dial tone)

22:45.990 --> 22:47.075
(* heartfelt music *)

22:51.246 --> 22:52.706
You alright?

22:52.747 --> 22:54.124
Hmm?

22:54.165 --> 22:56.126
Oh, yes, fine.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.669
Thank you.

22:57.711 --> 23:00.463
Maybe that's enough for
your first go-round.

23:00.505 --> 23:02.382
Tomorrow's the big day.

23:02.424 --> 23:04.134
You need your rest for
the Thanksgiving rush.

23:04.175 --> 23:05.760
Thanks Roger.

23:12.142 --> 23:13.184
(phones ringing)

23:13.226 --> 23:17.063
(call center chatter)

23:20.567 --> 23:21.860
(* heartfelt music *)

23:29.242 --> 23:30.452
(bell chiming)

23:30.493 --> 23:31.911
(* piano music *)

23:39.919 --> 23:41.463
You don't have to
do that, you know.

23:41.504 --> 23:45.383
Oh, hi.

23:45.425 --> 23:47.802
What are you
doing here?

23:47.844 --> 23:49.929
Well, I am the one
who broke the handle.

23:49.971 --> 23:51.931
I thought maybe I
could find a new one.

23:51.973 --> 23:54.142
What are you
doing here?

23:54.184 --> 23:55.894
Well, as my brother
pointed out,

23:55.935 --> 23:58.897
I was the one who was being
prickly the other day.

23:58.938 --> 24:01.358
I thought maybe replacing
your handle would be

24:01.399 --> 24:02.734
a way to apologize.

24:02.776 --> 24:04.444
It's okay.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.363
You're passionate
about your work.

24:06.404 --> 24:08.239
I get it.

24:11.618 --> 24:14.454
That's crackling -
antique kitchen bits.

24:15.830 --> 24:18.249
Ou, Chicago
is pricey.

24:18.291 --> 24:19.668
I'll have to take out
a loan just to buy

24:19.709 --> 24:21.419
a pack of
crisps here.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.921
That's chips, right?

24:22.962 --> 24:24.339
No.

24:24.381 --> 24:25.924
Chips are fried
potatoes.
You mean
French fries.

24:25.965 --> 24:28.927
No. The French stole the
idea from the British.

24:28.968 --> 24:31.262
Uh, yeah, well of
course they did, hmm.

24:32.806 --> 24:34.683
This thing's probably
got a hundred years of

24:34.724 --> 24:36.142
memories baked onto it.

24:36.184 --> 24:37.936
Oh, I hope not.
That's disgusting.

24:39.813 --> 24:41.773
It's called seasoning.

24:41.815 --> 24:43.525
That's what makes cast iron
skillets so wonderful

24:43.566 --> 24:44.984
to cook with.

24:45.026 --> 24:46.444
Oh.

24:46.486 --> 24:48.446
Do, do you cook?

24:48.488 --> 24:50.699
I choose not to.

24:50.740 --> 24:52.117
Same.

24:52.158 --> 24:53.702
Yeah, well, actually
people ask me not to

24:53.743 --> 24:55.995
because I'm beyond
terrible at it.

24:57.080 --> 24:59.290
Speaking of which,
um, I better run

24:59.332 --> 25:01.626
because I have to
pick up dinner.

25:01.668 --> 25:03.336
Oh, me, too.

25:04.254 --> 25:05.922
I'll let you know if I
find that door handle.

25:05.964 --> 25:08.717
I promise not to
break it if you do!

25:08.758 --> 25:10.468
(laughs)

25:10.510 --> 25:11.469
Yeah.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.643
Okay, sweetie,
there you go.

25:18.685 --> 25:23.148
Dad, why is there a
turkey in the bathtub?

25:23.189 --> 25:27.485
Oh, um...because
he was cold.

25:27.527 --> 25:29.988
(laughs)

25:30.030 --> 25:34.659
Hey, um, can I ask
you a question?

25:34.701 --> 25:36.619
That's already
a question.

25:36.661 --> 25:38.663
Right.

25:38.705 --> 25:40.999
You know that
holiday essay.

25:41.041 --> 25:45.003
I saw that you started writing
about 'Opening Presents'.

25:45.045 --> 25:46.796
I thought you were gonna
wait to see if I could

25:46.838 --> 25:48.631
step up with
the turkey.

25:48.673 --> 25:50.300
It's okay, Dad.

25:50.342 --> 25:53.636
A turkey's a lot harder than
fruit and cottage cheese.

25:53.678 --> 25:55.680
I thought I'd
go easy on you.

25:55.722 --> 25:58.516
Hmm, okay.

25:58.558 --> 26:00.352
Good night,
princess.

26:00.393 --> 26:01.853
(mwah)

26:01.895 --> 26:02.771
I love you.

26:02.812 --> 26:04.773
Good night, Dad.
Love you more.

26:04.814 --> 26:07.859
No way, kiddo.
I love you more.

26:07.901 --> 26:09.027
(* heartwarming music *)

26:18.995 --> 26:20.538
(* whimsical music *)

26:20.580 --> 26:23.291
Well, I hope you had a lovely
evening at the spa last night.

26:30.507 --> 26:32.300
Round two.

26:33.968 --> 26:35.303
(phone ringing)

26:35.345 --> 26:36.388
Holiday Hotline.

26:36.429 --> 26:37.639
Let's talk turkey.

26:37.681 --> 26:39.391
Happy Thanksgiving!

26:39.432 --> 26:41.393
And thank you for
coming in early.

26:41.434 --> 26:43.395
Today is basically
our Super Bowl.

26:43.436 --> 26:46.231
I'm ready, willing
and almost awake.

26:46.856 --> 26:49.651
Well, this afternoon, we will
be having our own Thanksgiving,

26:49.693 --> 26:51.236
even while we make
others better.

26:51.277 --> 26:53.405
We're basically one
big family here.

26:53.446 --> 26:54.739
It's lovely.

26:54.781 --> 26:56.449
I bet everyone misses
Margaret though.

26:56.491 --> 26:59.744
Oh, well, I hear she's having
a ball with her grandkids.

26:59.786 --> 27:01.621
Check this out.

27:04.708 --> 27:07.585
Oh, she hasn't gotten the
hang of a selfie yet.

27:07.627 --> 27:08.253
(phone ringing)

27:08.294 --> 27:09.587
Oh!

27:09.629 --> 27:12.007
Oh, buckle up,
it's go time!

27:14.801 --> 27:15.760
Holiday Hotline.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.595
Let's talk turkey.

27:17.637 --> 27:19.305
Is this Peggy?

27:19.347 --> 27:21.516
I was hoping to
talk to Peggy.

27:21.558 --> 27:23.977
Yes, this is Peggy.

27:24.019 --> 27:29.441
Hi, um, this is John
from, from yesterday.

27:29.482 --> 27:31.901
John.

27:31.943 --> 27:34.279
Yeah, I wanted
to apologize.

27:34.320 --> 27:37.574
I was, I was going through
a thing, but I'm good now.

27:37.615 --> 27:39.784
Hey, don't you worry.

27:39.826 --> 27:42.787
I'm really glad
you called back.

27:42.829 --> 27:44.914
Yeah, this turkey deal, it's
proving to be more challenging

27:44.956 --> 27:46.958
than I thought.

27:47.000 --> 27:50.962
You know, more often than
not, the biggest obstacle

27:51.004 --> 27:53.757
when cooking a turkey
is the emotional part.

27:53.798 --> 27:56.885
The emotional part?

27:56.926 --> 27:59.095
Well, it can be
intimidating.

27:59.137 --> 28:01.931
There are high expectations
around the holiday turkey.

28:01.973 --> 28:03.808
And that
makes sense.

28:03.850 --> 28:05.935
I've been avoiding
it all morning.

28:05.977 --> 28:09.606
And it is scary,
but as I mentioned,

28:09.647 --> 28:12.317
it brings up a lot.

28:12.359 --> 28:18.490
I, I know it's not really my
place, but if you need to talk,

28:18.531 --> 28:20.367
I'm happy to listen.

28:20.408 --> 28:22.285
It might help.

28:23.912 --> 28:26.706
Thank you, um, that's,
that's very kind.

28:26.748 --> 28:30.543
The truth is I, I probably
don't talk about it enough.

28:30.585 --> 28:36.174
But it's, um, the loss
is there all the time.

28:36.216 --> 28:39.469
How long ago, if you
don't mind me asking?

28:39.511 --> 28:41.388
Three years.

28:41.429 --> 28:43.181
I see.

28:43.223 --> 28:48.186
Yeah, I'm working my way through
it, but it's my daughter.

28:48.228 --> 28:53.400
I just recently realize that
having Christmas dinner at home

28:53.441 --> 28:56.528
is the thing that
she misses the most.

28:56.569 --> 28:59.781
Food is a powerful
connector to memories.

28:59.823 --> 29:02.367
Indeed, it is.

29:02.409 --> 29:06.621
I guess I, I just, I worry that
no matter how I do with this,

29:06.663 --> 29:09.541
it'll never be
what it was.

29:09.582 --> 29:11.918
Healing takes time.

29:11.960 --> 29:16.506
I'm...I'm just
learning that myself.

29:16.548 --> 29:18.550
It's hard to let go of
what we thought our life

29:18.591 --> 29:20.552
was going to be.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.555
Yeah.

29:23.596 --> 29:25.390
Hey, you're right.

29:25.432 --> 29:27.225
It's the hardest
thing there is.

29:27.267 --> 29:29.561
Don't give up, John.

29:29.602 --> 29:32.230
Thanksgiving is a
perfect practice run.

29:32.272 --> 29:33.606
You can get all
the kinks out,

29:33.648 --> 29:35.608
and be ready for the
main event on Christmas.

29:35.650 --> 29:38.319
And don't worry, the hotline
will be open all the way

29:38.361 --> 29:39.863
through Christmas
Eve Day.

29:39.904 --> 29:41.531
And you'll be there?

29:41.573 --> 29:43.074
Absolutely.

29:43.116 --> 29:45.035
I can help you every
step of the way.

29:45.076 --> 29:46.911
So, let's not
"fowl" it up.

29:46.953 --> 29:48.538
(laughing)

29:48.580 --> 29:50.331
Good one.

29:50.373 --> 29:54.461
Um, thank you for
listening, means a lot.

29:54.502 --> 29:56.421
Well, then, let's
keep going.

29:56.463 --> 29:58.465
I'll talk you through
the prep process.

29:58.506 --> 30:00.467
I'm all ears.

30:04.971 --> 30:08.308
Of course, it's
my pleasure.

30:08.350 --> 30:10.268
Happy Thanksgiving, John.

30:12.979 --> 30:14.272
(* lighthearted music *)

30:23.698 --> 30:25.116
(* melodic music *)

30:43.176 --> 30:45.762
(phone buzzing)

30:46.304 --> 30:47.847
Hi, Mum.

30:47.889 --> 30:48.723
Hi, Dad.

30:48.765 --> 30:49.974
Hello, sweetheart!

30:50.016 --> 30:51.434
Cheers, pet!

30:51.476 --> 30:54.729
Are you eating a
microwave burrito?

30:54.771 --> 30:56.231
What's wrong
with that?

30:56.272 --> 30:58.775
Well, I don't think I've ever
seen you use the microwave

30:58.817 --> 31:01.194
in your entire
adult life.

31:01.236 --> 31:05.031
The act of actually cooking
just doesn't appeal right now.

31:05.073 --> 31:06.449
It's no big deal.

31:06.491 --> 31:09.119
So, how is
Thanksgiving in London?

31:09.160 --> 31:10.912
Aces, brilliant.

31:10.954 --> 31:13.957
But we missed your turkey and
your cranberry brie bites.

31:13.998 --> 31:17.669
And I missed your glorious
Yorkshire pudding, of course.

31:17.711 --> 31:20.130
Anyone miss me?

31:20.171 --> 31:21.464
Or just my cooking?

31:21.506 --> 31:22.882
Of course,
we missed you.

31:22.924 --> 31:25.885
Hogwash, we're missing
you as we speak.

31:25.927 --> 31:28.179
How are you
spending your time?

31:28.221 --> 31:33.309
I'm, um, doing some
culinary consulting work,

31:33.351 --> 31:35.812
while avoiding anyone
and anything to do with

31:35.854 --> 31:37.105
the restaurant scene.

31:37.147 --> 31:38.940
Oh, Abigail.

31:38.982 --> 31:41.192
And I don't even want
to think about my future

31:41.234 --> 31:42.819
until I get back.

31:42.861 --> 31:45.321
I am on vacation from
thinking, cooking, dating,

31:45.363 --> 31:48.324
and anything else ending in
"ing" that I can't think of

31:48.366 --> 31:52.662
right now, because, as I said,
I am on vacation from thinking.

31:52.704 --> 31:54.664
Are you
sleep-"ing"?

31:54.706 --> 31:55.999
Of course.

31:56.041 --> 31:57.667
Quite well,
as it happens.

31:57.709 --> 31:59.502
(laughing)

31:59.544 --> 32:01.212
Oh, can I
call you back?

32:02.130 --> 32:03.465
(beeping)

32:03.882 --> 32:05.008
Bye.

32:05.050 --> 32:06.051
Bye-bye.

32:12.349 --> 32:13.308
Wow.

32:13.350 --> 32:15.226
You don't waste
any time, do you?

32:15.268 --> 32:17.812
Oh, we take Christmas very
seriously around here.

32:17.854 --> 32:19.773
And not just the
turkey dinner part.

32:19.814 --> 32:21.816
Which I hear was
going very well.

32:21.858 --> 32:24.110
And here's
your wreath.

32:24.152 --> 32:26.196
Oh, so this is an
official thing?

32:26.237 --> 32:28.073
Yep. Everyone
decorates their own.

32:28.114 --> 32:31.368
There's a "best
door décor" prize.

32:31.409 --> 32:33.870
Which I
intend to win.

32:33.912 --> 32:35.789
What's the prize?

32:35.830 --> 32:38.333
The prize is lording
it over Carla in 32.

32:38.375 --> 32:40.085
(laughs)

32:40.126 --> 32:42.295
Well, I can't wait
to get started.

32:42.337 --> 32:44.047
Is there somewhere
close by with Christmas

32:44.089 --> 32:45.882
bits and bobs
I can use?

32:45.924 --> 32:48.301
Okay, you are just
adorable with that accent.

32:48.343 --> 32:50.387
There's a wonderful
little Christmas shop

32:50.428 --> 32:51.888
a couple of blocks down.

32:51.930 --> 32:54.057
It's a really good
gift shop, too.

32:54.099 --> 32:56.226
You know, in case you wanted to
bring something back to London

32:56.267 --> 32:58.103
for your boyfriend?

32:58.144 --> 32:59.562
Or girlfriend?

32:59.604 --> 33:02.524
Or miscellaneous
significant other?

33:02.565 --> 33:03.983
None of the above.

33:04.025 --> 33:06.152
But the shop
sounds lovely.

33:06.194 --> 33:08.863
You know, Mike and I are headed
out to get a Christmas tree

33:08.905 --> 33:10.323
if you want
to tag along.

33:10.365 --> 33:12.242
And we won't be long 'cause
I've got to work tonight.

33:12.283 --> 33:14.244
I don't think I'll be
getting a tree this year.

33:14.285 --> 33:17.288
Decorating the wreath
is enough for me.

33:17.330 --> 33:18.873
It's for the
main lobby.

33:18.915 --> 33:21.126
We have a little tree
trimming party and everyone

33:21.167 --> 33:23.753
puts one personal
ornament on it.

33:23.795 --> 33:25.672
Something that
represents who they are.

33:25.714 --> 33:26.965
You should come.

33:27.007 --> 33:29.592
(* melodic music *)

33:29.634 --> 33:31.803
** We Wish You a
Merry Christmas *

33:31.845 --> 33:33.930
* We Wish You a Merry
Christmas *

33:33.972 --> 33:36.766
* We Wish You a Merry
Christmas and a... *

33:36.808 --> 33:37.976
I'll be right back.

33:38.018 --> 33:39.394
* ...Happy New Year *

33:39.436 --> 33:41.938
* Good tidings we bring
to you and your king **

33:41.980 --> 33:43.481
Don't you look lovely.

33:43.523 --> 33:44.858
Merry Christmas.

33:44.899 --> 33:46.317
What do you think?

33:46.359 --> 33:48.403
Well, it's a bit
wobbly for the middle.

33:48.445 --> 33:49.446
Hi Jack!

33:49.487 --> 33:50.864
Hey, Jessica.

33:50.905 --> 33:52.782
Fancy meeting
you two here.

33:52.824 --> 33:54.659
But you two asked
us to meet you.

33:54.701 --> 33:56.119
We did?

33:56.161 --> 33:58.288
What's going
on with her?

33:58.329 --> 34:00.081
Going?

34:00.123 --> 34:01.291
On?

34:01.332 --> 34:02.417
You, too?

34:03.710 --> 34:05.170
(* melodic music *)

34:08.340 --> 34:09.549
Oh.

34:09.591 --> 34:11.301
What?

34:11.343 --> 34:12.927
It's not
about you.

34:12.969 --> 34:15.096
She wants to experience a
full-fledged American Christmas,

34:15.138 --> 34:17.015
and that always
involves buying a tree!

34:17.057 --> 34:18.183
Yeah.

34:19.184 --> 34:20.185
Hi, Jack.

34:20.226 --> 34:23.772
Happy
Day-After-Thanksgiving.

34:23.813 --> 34:25.148
I think you mean
Black Friday.

34:25.190 --> 34:28.068
But I'm, I'm guessing you
don't have that in England

34:28.109 --> 34:29.819
because you don't
have Thanksgiving.

34:29.861 --> 34:32.072
Actually, we do
have Black Friday.

34:32.113 --> 34:33.323
Oh, I didn't
know that.

34:33.365 --> 34:35.158
Commerce prevails!

34:35.200 --> 34:37.911
And we also have
Taupe Tuesday.

34:37.952 --> 34:40.038
But it's
kind of boring.

34:40.080 --> 34:43.083
Because taupe is
a boring color.

34:43.124 --> 34:44.668
It's not a
real thing.

34:44.709 --> 34:47.128
(laughing)

34:47.170 --> 34:50.215
I realize that's a mercy
laugh, but I'll take it.

34:50.256 --> 34:51.841
(laughs)

34:51.883 --> 34:53.843
It's not a mercy laugh,
but all Taupe Tuesday.

34:53.885 --> 34:55.970
Yeah, that's a Jack
joke all day long.

34:56.012 --> 34:58.056
It's like a dad
joke, just way worse.

34:58.098 --> 34:59.849
He's probably jealous he
didn't come up with it.

34:59.891 --> 35:02.102
Oh, thank you, Mike.

35:02.143 --> 35:04.771
Oh, this is my
daughter, Jessica.

35:04.813 --> 35:06.815
Jessica, this is Abby.

35:06.856 --> 35:07.941
She's from
London, England.

35:07.982 --> 35:09.192
Like Harry Potter?

35:09.234 --> 35:12.237
Oh, Harry and
I go way back.

35:12.278 --> 35:15.323
He's a fictional
character from a book.

35:15.365 --> 35:17.242
Smart kid.

35:17.283 --> 35:20.912
Yeah, sometimes too smart
for her own good, huh?

35:20.954 --> 35:24.207
Well, it's very nice
to meet you, Jessica.

35:24.249 --> 35:27.293
I was going to get some hot
cocoa if you'd like some?

35:27.335 --> 35:29.879
Can I?

35:29.921 --> 35:31.214
Sure, yeah.

35:31.256 --> 35:33.049
All right,
come with me.

35:37.429 --> 35:39.931
(gurgling)

35:39.973 --> 35:40.849
What's the matter?

35:40.890 --> 35:41.975
Something
wrong with it?

35:42.017 --> 35:44.561
Whipped cream always
melts too fast.

35:44.602 --> 35:46.271
I have a special
trick for that.

35:46.312 --> 35:47.439
Hang on.

35:49.774 --> 35:51.735
Excuse me,
strange request.

35:51.776 --> 35:53.653
What is she doing?

35:53.695 --> 35:54.946
Thank you very much.

35:58.116 --> 36:01.995
Alright, take a sip.

36:03.997 --> 36:06.291
And another one.

36:08.001 --> 36:10.378
And one more.

36:10.420 --> 36:14.424
(giggling)

36:16.259 --> 36:19.054
Come on, guys, let's
go find a good tree.

36:21.931 --> 36:23.266
(phone ringing)

36:23.308 --> 36:25.977
No, you have to use
a meat thermometer.

36:26.019 --> 36:27.896
There are lots of ways
to prepare a turkey.

36:27.937 --> 36:29.939
You're so welcome.

36:29.981 --> 36:32.275
Make sure you let the turkey
rest for twenty minutes.

36:32.317 --> 36:33.443
You can do it.

36:33.485 --> 36:35.153
Deglaze the pan?

36:35.195 --> 36:37.322
So, am I supposed to take
it to, like, a body shop?

36:37.364 --> 36:38.865
(laughs)

36:38.907 --> 36:40.116
Holiday Hotline.

36:40.158 --> 36:41.493
Let's talk turkey.

36:42.911 --> 36:44.871
Yeah, all I want to
know is how do I wake up

36:44.913 --> 36:46.998
a turkey after it rests, huh?

36:47.040 --> 36:48.375
What do I,
give it a slap?

36:48.416 --> 36:50.418
I mean it's already
dead, am I right?

36:50.460 --> 36:53.338
Just tell it to wake
up and you'll be fine.

36:53.380 --> 36:54.923
Merry Christmas.

36:54.964 --> 36:58.385
Hey, not so fast.

36:58.426 --> 37:02.180
Something tells me
that you know too much.

37:02.222 --> 37:05.183
About how to make a delicious
cheese cake for dessert.

37:05.225 --> 37:06.518
Huh?

37:06.559 --> 37:10.814
Oh, oh, yes, I do.

37:10.855 --> 37:14.109
The secret is
cottage cheese.

37:14.150 --> 37:15.360
(* whimsical music *)

37:21.866 --> 37:23.493
Your secret's safe with me.

37:23.993 --> 37:25.203
(* melodic music *)

37:27.497 --> 37:28.623
Yes.

37:30.000 --> 37:31.042
Holiday Hotline.

37:31.084 --> 37:32.752
Let's talk turkey.

37:32.794 --> 37:35.255
He-he-he-hum.

37:35.296 --> 37:38.008
We have a caller
looking for Peggy.

37:38.049 --> 37:40.176
It's John.

37:40.218 --> 37:42.512
Does he always sound this
eager to talk to you?

37:42.554 --> 37:45.098
I hadn't noticed.

37:45.140 --> 37:48.852
You know when you lie, Santa
takes you off the nice list.

37:48.893 --> 37:50.520
It's Father
Christmas.

37:50.562 --> 37:52.188
I'm British,
remember?

37:52.230 --> 37:56.359
Maybe I should tell John I'm
not really Peggy, or American.

37:56.401 --> 37:58.278
No, you can't do that.
Why not?

37:58.319 --> 38:00.238
Well, because he
opened up to you.

38:00.280 --> 38:02.198
He, he was vulnerable with you,
and if he thinks you're just

38:02.240 --> 38:03.992
playing games with him, well
he'll feel like a fool,

38:04.034 --> 38:06.119
and he may never call
the hotline again.

38:06.161 --> 38:07.704
He'll be too
embarrassed.

38:07.746 --> 38:09.289
You're right.

38:09.330 --> 38:12.250
I don't want him to think I
didn't take his call seriously.

38:12.292 --> 38:15.211
As a turkey
expert, I mean.

38:15.253 --> 38:16.963
Oh, yes, of course.

38:17.005 --> 38:19.090
And the other callers
have been responding

38:19.132 --> 38:20.925
to me better as Peggy.

38:20.967 --> 38:23.553
There you go.

38:23.595 --> 38:25.472
Peggy lives! Ha-ha.

38:25.513 --> 38:27.724
Line two.

38:32.228 --> 38:33.688
(* Uplifting music *)

38:35.398 --> 38:36.649
Hi, John.

38:36.691 --> 38:38.234
Hi, Peggy.

38:43.365 --> 38:45.283
It's good to
hear from you.

38:45.325 --> 38:46.826
How did
Thanksgiving go?

38:46.868 --> 38:49.454
Well, I followed
your advice to a T,

38:49.496 --> 38:52.540
except for the part about taking
it out of the oven on time.

38:52.582 --> 38:54.250
Oh, no.
Yeah.

38:54.292 --> 38:56.586
Anyway, my family had a
back-up turkey ready to go.

38:56.628 --> 39:00.465
And I wasn't sure whether I
should be grateful or insulted.

39:00.507 --> 39:02.801
Well, then there's
nowhere to go but up.

39:02.842 --> 39:05.470
You still have time to
do another test turkey.

39:05.512 --> 39:07.472
Well, that's actually
why I'm calling.

39:07.514 --> 39:09.599
But now I'm
second-guessing myself.

39:09.641 --> 39:11.559
Nope. You called.

39:11.601 --> 39:13.144
We're doing this.

39:13.186 --> 39:15.438
So, how many people would
you be serving on Christmas?

39:15.480 --> 39:17.273
Five to seven.

39:17.315 --> 39:19.734
My parents haven't decided if
they're going to Florida yet.

39:19.776 --> 39:21.695
So maybe more
left overs.

39:21.736 --> 39:24.823
I'd recommend a
twelve pounder.
Oh, okay.

39:24.864 --> 39:30.161
To brine or not to brine,
that is the question!

39:30.203 --> 39:31.579
(laughs)

39:31.621 --> 39:32.914
Definitely brine.

39:32.956 --> 39:35.291
It locks in so
much of the flavor.

39:35.333 --> 39:38.670
Once it's thawed, call me
back, and we'll go from there.

39:38.712 --> 39:41.756
Okay, but what if you're
not there when I call?

39:41.798 --> 39:45.260
Well, everyone
here is an expert.

39:45.301 --> 39:49.848
Yeah, I know, but I mean,
you know my whole...deal.

39:49.889 --> 39:52.434
You know I'm still a little bit
embarrassed that I spilled

39:52.475 --> 39:54.310
my guts like
that the other day.

39:54.352 --> 39:55.687
Don't be.

39:55.729 --> 39:57.856
Sometimes it takes talking
to someone you don't know

39:57.897 --> 40:00.608
to really talk turkey.

40:00.650 --> 40:02.610
(laughing)

40:02.652 --> 40:04.696
Sorry, bad joke.

40:04.738 --> 40:06.322
I am full of
those lately.

40:06.364 --> 40:07.907
No, no, no.

40:07.949 --> 40:10.535
You're right, because I know,
like, once I get through this,

40:10.577 --> 40:13.038
everything
else is gravy.

40:13.079 --> 40:14.914
(laughing)

40:14.956 --> 40:17.208
Okay, that is
so much worse.

40:17.250 --> 40:21.254
Seriously though, if you do
want to make sure to get me

40:21.296 --> 40:24.966
on the line, this week I'm here
from noon to eight central time.

40:25.008 --> 40:26.843
Perfect.

40:26.885 --> 40:28.636
I'm on the central
time zone, too.

40:28.678 --> 40:30.388
Chicago.

40:30.430 --> 40:32.640
That's where I am.

40:32.682 --> 40:35.560
For some reason you
sound really far away.

40:35.602 --> 40:38.980
Oh, yeah, that's, that's because
my daughter spilt a little bit

40:39.022 --> 40:40.857
of orange juice
on my cell phone.

40:40.899 --> 40:42.776
You know, like
a gallon or so.

40:42.817 --> 40:44.694
Well, that
would do it.

40:44.736 --> 40:45.987
Yeah.

40:46.029 --> 40:47.489
Okay, so just
to be clear,

40:47.530 --> 40:51.034
call back sometime this
week noon 'til eight?
Yeah.

40:51.076 --> 40:55.372
All right, it's a
date...for talking turkey,

40:55.413 --> 40:59.751
about actual turkey, not that
turkeys can talk that's...
Right.

40:59.793 --> 41:03.463
Right, okay,
we'll talk then.
Bye.

41:03.505 --> 41:04.881
Bye.

41:16.518 --> 41:18.144
He lives in Chicago!

41:18.186 --> 41:20.522
Blimey, were you
eavesdropping?

41:20.563 --> 41:21.856
Uh, yeah.

41:21.898 --> 41:23.274
This is my new
favorite show.

41:23.316 --> 41:26.319
It's The Love Birds
with Peggy and John!

41:26.361 --> 41:29.698
It's The Love
Birds with Peggy and John.

41:29.739 --> 41:33.284
The Love Birds with
Peggy and John.
(laughs)

41:33.326 --> 41:34.577
I just made that up.

41:34.619 --> 41:35.870
(laughs)

41:42.585 --> 41:43.753
Hey, want
to grab lunch?

41:43.795 --> 41:45.422
I need a
twelve-pound turkey.

41:45.463 --> 41:46.715
For lunch?

41:46.756 --> 41:47.966
Seems excessive.

41:48.008 --> 41:49.843
To try and make
at home, again.

41:49.884 --> 41:51.678
What changed
your mind?

41:51.720 --> 41:54.264
Seeing Jess have so much
fun at the tree lot.

41:54.305 --> 41:56.474
She still loves
Christmas so much.

41:56.516 --> 41:58.852
I owe it to her.

41:58.893 --> 42:01.354
Plus, Peggy from the
Hotline is gonna help me.

42:01.396 --> 42:02.731
Who-who really?

42:02.772 --> 42:04.065
Okay, new topic.

42:04.107 --> 42:05.483
Okay.

42:05.525 --> 42:07.277
Seemed like you and Abby
hit it off at the tree lot.

42:07.318 --> 42:09.654
Why are you so determined
to pair me up with someone?

42:09.696 --> 42:13.324
Because at some point, you
have to stop living in the past

42:13.366 --> 42:15.076
and start thinking
about the future.

42:15.118 --> 42:18.329
It's kind of hard to do when
my entire career is literally

42:18.371 --> 42:19.789
all about the past.

42:19.831 --> 42:23.877
Uh, our job is about honoring
it, not clinging to it.

42:23.918 --> 42:26.254
And you know I wasn't
talking about work.

42:29.132 --> 42:30.342
(ding)

42:34.554 --> 42:35.972
(* uplifting music *)

42:52.113 --> 42:53.406
(* melodic music *)

42:59.287 --> 43:00.914
If you were planning on
breaking and entering,

43:00.955 --> 43:02.582
you're doing it wrong.

43:02.624 --> 43:03.750
I should've knocked.

43:03.792 --> 43:05.919
This probably
looks creepy, huh?

43:05.960 --> 43:08.546
If we hadn't already
met, definitely.

43:08.588 --> 43:11.675
But since we've already
met...still creepy.

43:11.716 --> 43:13.510
Yeah.

43:13.551 --> 43:14.552
So, you found
the match.

43:14.594 --> 43:16.096
All that angst
for nothing.

43:16.137 --> 43:17.555
Yeah, I thought so.

43:17.597 --> 43:19.557
But the holes
don't line up.

43:19.599 --> 43:21.685
So, make new holes.

43:21.726 --> 43:24.396
Whoa, are you insane?

43:24.437 --> 43:27.565
I can't just drill
into this door.

43:27.607 --> 43:29.901
It's more, it's more
precious than the handle!

43:29.943 --> 43:33.697
And...I'm doing it
again, aren't I?

43:33.738 --> 43:35.699
A little bit.

43:35.740 --> 43:36.950
Yeah.

43:36.991 --> 43:40.412
So, I shouldn't hammer a
large nail into the door

43:40.453 --> 43:42.372
to hang my wreath?

43:42.414 --> 43:43.873
You're killing me.

43:43.915 --> 43:45.792
You don't have
a door hanger?

43:45.834 --> 43:47.210
Wouldn't
you know it?

43:47.252 --> 43:48.920
The one thing I
forgot to pack.

43:48.962 --> 43:50.255
Right.

43:50.296 --> 43:52.007
Okay, give me
ten minutes.

43:52.048 --> 43:54.259
Don't touch
the door, okay.

43:54.300 --> 43:57.429
I think the Christmas
shop around the corner

43:57.470 --> 43:58.930
probably has something.

43:58.972 --> 44:00.515
Oh, I was going to
go there myself.

44:00.557 --> 44:03.059
I need an ornament for the
building's tree-trimming party.

44:04.686 --> 44:06.021
What's wrong?

44:06.062 --> 44:07.772
You, you just reminded
me I haven't done the tree

44:07.814 --> 44:10.608
with my kid.

44:10.650 --> 44:14.654
My wife was much more
organized about these things.

44:14.696 --> 44:15.864
Was?

44:15.905 --> 44:18.742
Yeah, she was, yeah.

44:18.783 --> 44:21.703
Oh, I'm sorry.

44:21.745 --> 44:22.829
Oh, thank you.

44:22.871 --> 44:24.706
But it's been a while.

44:24.748 --> 44:27.625
Let's just get you
that hanger, huh?

44:27.667 --> 44:29.461
I'll get my coat.

44:29.502 --> 44:30.754
Okay.

44:39.804 --> 44:41.514
It's that guy.

44:43.391 --> 44:44.809
Thank you.

44:44.851 --> 44:46.436
You didn't have
to buy it for me.

44:46.478 --> 44:47.645
Oh, I'm not.

44:47.687 --> 44:49.689
I'm buying it for your
poor, beleaguered door.

44:49.731 --> 44:52.650
Plus, I thought I'd look
for an ornament for Jess.

44:52.692 --> 44:54.903
We've been getting her one every
year since she was a baby,

44:54.944 --> 44:56.988
so that way when
she grows up,

44:57.030 --> 44:58.656
she'll have a
collection of her own.

44:58.698 --> 45:00.533
There, just at
the back here.

45:01.826 --> 45:04.496
Oh, this is perfect.

45:04.537 --> 45:07.499
Jessica started playing guitar
this year, and by playing,

45:07.540 --> 45:10.293
I mean not playing
any actual chords,

45:10.335 --> 45:12.587
but fully committing to
the rock star aesthetic.

45:12.629 --> 45:14.673
Pa-little-little-la.

45:14.714 --> 45:16.508
I think you missed
your calling.

45:16.549 --> 45:17.634
(laughs)

45:17.676 --> 45:19.302
Alright, your turn.

45:19.344 --> 45:20.679
Okay.

45:20.720 --> 45:22.305
Well, the ornament for the
lobby tree is supposed to be

45:22.347 --> 45:24.641
something that
represents each of us.

45:24.683 --> 45:26.101
Mm-hmm.

45:32.732 --> 45:35.944
I think this is me more than
anything else right now.

45:35.985 --> 45:39.030
You're sparkly
and overpriced?

45:39.072 --> 45:41.866
I was going for multifaceted
and unpredictable.

45:41.908 --> 45:43.201
Wow.

45:43.243 --> 45:44.619
You're incredibly
self-aware.

45:44.661 --> 45:46.579
Ha!

45:48.081 --> 45:50.750
"For the multifaceted and
unpredictable person

45:50.792 --> 45:54.713
in your life, who lights
up every room they're in."

45:54.754 --> 45:57.507
Huh, you skipped
that last part.

45:57.549 --> 45:58.883
I'm British.

45:58.925 --> 46:00.552
We walk into a room and
deliberately avoid

46:00.593 --> 46:02.220
attracting attention.

46:02.262 --> 46:06.558
Hmm, so I shouldn't do
something like this?

46:06.599 --> 46:08.560
Hey! Holiday Shoppers!

46:08.601 --> 46:09.936
This here is Abby,

46:09.978 --> 46:12.731
and she is visiting Chicago
all the way from London!

46:12.772 --> 46:14.733
Can we get a
Merry Christmas?

46:14.774 --> 46:17.485
Shoppers: Merry Christmas!

46:17.527 --> 46:19.571
That's just cruel.

46:19.612 --> 46:21.906
(laughs)

46:21.948 --> 46:23.450
(* uplifting music *)

46:26.119 --> 46:29.581
Well, thank you for
the unwanted attention.

46:29.622 --> 46:30.999
And the wreath hanger.

46:31.041 --> 46:33.877
Thank you for not destroying
any more of your apartment.

46:33.918 --> 46:36.254
So, you're back
to that, huh?

46:36.296 --> 46:38.340
Oh, I never left.

46:38.381 --> 46:39.758
(laughs)

46:42.886 --> 46:45.889
Think I have everything I
need for Operation Turkey.

46:45.930 --> 46:47.307
Hope I'm up to it.

46:47.349 --> 46:49.392
Don't worry, I've made an
extra-large pot of tea today,

46:49.434 --> 46:51.353
so I'm here as long
as you need me.

46:51.394 --> 46:52.937
I'm serious.
I can't mess this up.

46:52.979 --> 46:54.522
There's only two
weeks 'til Christmas.

46:54.564 --> 46:56.733
Hey, don't put so much
pressure on yourself.

46:56.775 --> 46:57.776
Have some fun.

46:57.817 --> 46:59.277
People have
fun doing this?

46:59.319 --> 47:00.945
Of course,
you'll see.

47:00.987 --> 47:03.239
Once you get the hang of it,
you start making it your own.

47:03.281 --> 47:04.824
That's the
joy of cooking.

47:04.866 --> 47:07.285
Or at least it
was for me once.

47:07.327 --> 47:09.120
Oh, but not anymore?

47:09.162 --> 47:11.956
I...I love it.

47:11.998 --> 47:14.501
But, right now
talking about it,

47:14.542 --> 47:16.920
it's less painful
than actually doing it.

47:16.961 --> 47:18.546
It's complicated.

47:18.588 --> 47:20.465
Try me.

47:20.507 --> 47:22.550
Okay.

47:22.592 --> 47:25.387
My entire identity was wrapped
up in my cooking career...

47:25.428 --> 47:28.306
and in a former
relationship.

47:28.348 --> 47:31.309
Those two worlds were more mixed
than they should have been.

47:31.351 --> 47:35.563
Anyway, he was never
honest with me.

47:35.605 --> 47:40.652
In fact, he...he was
lying to me all along.

47:40.694 --> 47:42.654
I'm sorry that you had
to go through that.

47:42.696 --> 47:45.198
I've dealt with my fair
share of lies, too.

47:45.240 --> 47:47.826
But, um,
please, go on.

47:47.867 --> 47:50.870
No, you go ahead.

47:50.912 --> 47:54.666
Well, um, it was
my late wife.

47:54.708 --> 47:57.919
She kept her illness
a secret for a while.

47:57.961 --> 47:59.838
Even from me.

47:59.879 --> 48:01.548
I know she did
it to protect me.

48:01.589 --> 48:04.259
But, look, we don't
have to get into that.

48:04.300 --> 48:06.803
I'd like to hear more about
you, if you feel open to it.

48:06.845 --> 48:10.932
Well, the long and short
of it is I broke it off

48:10.974 --> 48:15.645
and haven't wanted to go
back to anything like that.

48:15.687 --> 48:17.355
I just wanted to see what
it was like to do something

48:17.397 --> 48:18.898
else for a while.

48:18.940 --> 48:20.442
Hmm.

48:20.483 --> 48:24.237
So, you took a job that's
literally all about cooking?

48:24.279 --> 48:25.780
This is different.

48:25.822 --> 48:29.284
This is me helping people
find the joy I once had.

48:29.325 --> 48:31.870
Right now, it's enough.

48:31.911 --> 48:35.832
Ha, I'm not convinced I'll ever
put the word joy in cooking

48:35.874 --> 48:37.542
in the same sentence.

48:37.584 --> 48:40.795
Well, then let's start with
not miserable and cooking.

48:40.837 --> 48:42.464
I can help.

48:42.505 --> 48:43.882
You just have
to trust me.

48:43.923 --> 48:45.550
I do trust you.

48:45.592 --> 48:47.677
Even though
we've never met.

48:47.719 --> 48:49.763
Which is...weird.

48:49.804 --> 48:51.598
But a good weird.

48:51.639 --> 48:52.599
A great weird.

48:54.225 --> 48:56.311
Okay, you have
to meet this guy.

48:56.353 --> 48:58.480
And live a lie
in real life?

48:58.521 --> 49:00.231
That's the last
thing John needs.

49:00.273 --> 49:01.649
Believe me.

49:01.691 --> 49:04.235
Well, I am still rooting
for Peggy and John.

49:04.277 --> 49:07.197
I said The Love
Birds, Peggy and John.

49:07.238 --> 49:10.450
Love Birds,
Peggy and John.

49:10.492 --> 49:12.952
The Love Birds,
Peggy and John.

49:17.457 --> 49:18.667
(* upbeat music *)

49:21.336 --> 49:23.588
I'm excited to see what
you made for the potluck!

49:23.630 --> 49:25.006
Which dish is yours?

49:25.048 --> 49:28.051
I made a trip to the market
and bought a baked brie.

49:28.093 --> 49:31.054
You're really committed to
this no cooking thing, huh?

49:31.096 --> 49:33.431
I am, and
it's liberating.

49:33.473 --> 49:35.975
Did you hang your
ornament on the tree?

49:36.017 --> 49:38.603
Oh, I almost forgot.

49:38.645 --> 49:40.563
Pretty.
Thanks.

49:40.605 --> 49:42.399
Boring.
Hey!

49:42.440 --> 49:44.275
I wanted to get the
roast turkey ornament,

49:44.317 --> 49:46.569
but I didn't want anyone
getting suspicious.

49:46.611 --> 49:49.030
Good thinking!

49:49.072 --> 49:51.616
So, which
ornament is yours?

49:51.658 --> 49:53.451
It's an
old-fashioned!

49:53.493 --> 49:54.536
Get it?

49:54.577 --> 49:55.870
'Cause I'm old.

49:55.912 --> 49:57.163
And you like fashion?

49:57.205 --> 49:59.332
No, because I like
to drink them.

49:59.374 --> 50:02.002
(laughing)

50:02.043 --> 50:03.503
There you are!

50:05.672 --> 50:07.007
(mwah)

50:07.048 --> 50:08.633
I hope you don't mind,
I dragged jack here with me.

50:08.675 --> 50:10.635
I wouldn't
say "dragged".

50:10.677 --> 50:13.054
Did you two
bring ornaments?

50:16.016 --> 50:17.142
Compasses.

50:17.183 --> 50:19.019
Because we're
architects.

50:19.060 --> 50:20.562
Yeah, and the T-squares
were too big.

50:20.603 --> 50:22.522
(laughing)

50:22.564 --> 50:24.482
Mine's a turkey foot!

50:24.524 --> 50:26.276
A what?!

50:26.317 --> 50:28.945
It's the little thingy that
holds IV tubes together.

50:28.987 --> 50:32.657
Winner-winner,
turkey dinner!

50:32.699 --> 50:34.617
(laughing)

50:34.659 --> 50:35.702
Hang it up.

50:36.536 --> 50:38.204
Lights up every room.

50:38.246 --> 50:39.998
I'm British, remember.

50:40.040 --> 50:41.291
Yeah.

50:43.668 --> 50:46.046
Say Christmas crackers

50:46.087 --> 50:47.964
All: Christmas crackers.

50:48.006 --> 50:50.800
Alright, who moved
the mistletoe?

50:50.842 --> 50:52.302
I may need that!

50:52.344 --> 50:54.888
I really want to be
her when I grow old.

50:54.929 --> 50:56.431
Oh, we all do.

50:56.473 --> 50:59.768
So, Abby, have you gone to the
Christmaskindle market yet?

50:59.809 --> 51:00.977
We're all going
tomorrow night.

51:01.019 --> 51:03.480
Oh, I'm dying to go,
but I have to work.

51:03.521 --> 51:05.398
Oh, I didn't realize you were
working while you were here.

51:05.440 --> 51:07.692
I just thought you were
out sightseeing every day.

51:07.734 --> 51:09.027
What do you do?

51:09.069 --> 51:12.030
Oh, just some free
lance...consulting.

51:12.072 --> 51:14.199
But aren't you working
at the hospital tomorrow?

51:14.240 --> 51:16.034
My shift doesn't
start 'til 11.

51:16.076 --> 51:18.078
You must be
knackered.

51:18.119 --> 51:19.454
When do you sleep?

51:19.496 --> 51:20.497
Sleep?

51:20.538 --> 51:22.207
What's that?

51:22.248 --> 51:23.416
Abby, come with me.

51:23.458 --> 51:25.043
I want to
introduce to someone.

51:25.085 --> 51:27.879
Okay. Bye.

51:27.921 --> 51:29.047
Nice save.

51:29.089 --> 51:30.507
Need to keep the
gravy train chugging.

51:30.548 --> 51:31.716
Choo-choo!

51:31.758 --> 51:33.009
(laughs)

51:33.051 --> 51:34.427
(* Jingle Bells music *)

51:45.188 --> 51:47.399
Oh, there's a lot you
can do with leftovers.

51:47.440 --> 51:50.276
Oh, turkey meatballs,
turkey enchiladas.

51:50.318 --> 51:53.071
My father used to make the best
turkey samosas around town.

51:53.113 --> 51:54.447
Turkey pozole,
turkey croquettes.

51:54.489 --> 51:57.117
Turkey tetrazzini, turkey
enchilada, turkey ramen,

51:57.158 --> 51:58.660
turkey Caesar salad, turkey
Reuben, turkey chili,

51:58.702 --> 52:01.329
turkey burgers, smoky turkey
corn chowder, turkey hash.

52:01.371 --> 52:03.248
You should hang
up and call 911.

52:04.332 --> 52:06.876
This is Peggy, now
let's talk turkey.

52:06.918 --> 52:08.253
Hi!

52:08.294 --> 52:12.090
So, I'm lookin' at
a turkey from 1999,

52:12.132 --> 52:14.259
sitting here in my
granny's freezer.

52:14.300 --> 52:16.428
Margaret, is that you?

52:16.469 --> 52:17.429
Who's this?

52:17.470 --> 52:18.888
It's Abby.

52:18.930 --> 52:20.765
But you said Peggy.

52:20.807 --> 52:22.267
Where's your accent?

52:22.308 --> 52:23.643
Are you even British?

52:23.685 --> 52:25.186
I am, Margaret.

52:25.228 --> 52:27.439
I just decided to use an
American accent for the hotline.

52:27.480 --> 52:30.567
You don't really have a
24-year-old turkey, do you?

52:30.608 --> 52:32.402
No.

52:32.444 --> 52:35.113
I was just trying to keep
you all on your toes.

52:35.155 --> 52:38.033
I've enjoyed spending so
much time with my grandkids,

52:38.074 --> 52:40.118
but I miss my
hotline family.

52:40.160 --> 52:42.037
They miss you, too.

52:42.078 --> 52:45.290
Maybe I could fill in
for you here and there?

52:45.331 --> 52:48.626
You know, in case there's
something you want to do

52:48.668 --> 52:50.045
while you're in Chicago?

52:50.086 --> 52:52.547
Say, go the
Christmas Market?

52:54.215 --> 52:57.802
It's a Chicago tradition,
which I'm sure you'll enjoy.

52:58.762 --> 53:01.097
** Deck the hall with
boughs of holly *

53:01.139 --> 53:02.515
* Fa la la la la, la la la **

53:02.557 --> 53:04.434
So, what do you think of
Christmas in Chicago, Abby?

53:04.476 --> 53:07.395
I imagine you prefer
more of a Dicken's vibe.

53:07.437 --> 53:09.731
Did you just
say vibe?

53:09.773 --> 53:12.525
Yeah, so what,
I'm hip.

53:12.567 --> 53:14.110
Even worse.

53:14.152 --> 53:15.945
It's a lot different
from London,

53:15.987 --> 53:18.114
but I really like it.

53:18.156 --> 53:20.533
And the architecture
in Chicago is stunning.

53:20.575 --> 53:23.161
I truly had no idea how
beautiful it is here.

53:23.203 --> 53:25.163
Have on done the
Burnham walk yet?

53:25.205 --> 53:26.998
The Burnham walk?

53:27.040 --> 53:29.292
Oh, it's Jack's
favorite area.

53:29.334 --> 53:30.502
It's not really
an official thing,

53:30.543 --> 53:32.587
but an area with
gorgeous architecture.

53:32.629 --> 53:36.216
We can take her to
Mike's for the night.

53:36.257 --> 53:38.927
Yeah, why you
deserve a night out.

53:38.968 --> 53:40.095
Can I dad?

53:40.136 --> 53:41.513
Please.

53:41.554 --> 53:43.181
You sure?

53:43.223 --> 53:45.975
Come on, Jack, I made an excuse
to watch my episodes of Bloomy.

53:46.017 --> 53:47.227
It is a great show.

53:47.268 --> 53:49.938
Okay, thanks, guys.

53:49.979 --> 53:52.357
I'll pick you up first
thing in the morning, okay?
Okay.

53:52.399 --> 53:54.693
I love you so much.
I love you more.

53:54.734 --> 53:55.819
(mwah)

53:55.860 --> 53:59.364
(* Fa-la-la, la-la-la,
la-la-la *)

53:59.406 --> 54:02.283
I think they're leaving
us alone on purpose.

54:02.325 --> 54:03.743
A hundred percent.

54:04.786 --> 54:08.164
That historic route's
only a five-minute walk.

54:08.206 --> 54:10.208
Shall we?

54:10.250 --> 54:11.626
We shall.

54:15.547 --> 54:18.133
So, that architecture was
greatly influenced by

54:18.174 --> 54:19.426
Daniel
Burnham's work.

54:19.467 --> 54:21.344
Sort of a
hero of mine.

54:21.386 --> 54:23.888
His designs are
timeless, classic.

54:23.930 --> 54:26.558
My apartment building is
a similar style, right?

54:26.599 --> 54:28.309
Yes!

54:28.351 --> 54:30.895
Dates back to
Burnham's time.
Okay.

54:30.937 --> 54:34.024
Now your whole door reaction
makes a lot more sense.

54:34.065 --> 54:35.400
Thanks.

54:35.442 --> 54:37.527
We're just trying to
preserve a part of the past,

54:37.569 --> 54:39.821
and stop developers
from tearing it all down

54:39.863 --> 54:41.197
and starting
from scratch.

54:41.239 --> 54:43.158
I can understand
the temptation.

54:43.199 --> 54:44.951
It's probably easier.

54:44.993 --> 54:48.038
To be honest, I think
I've been trying to do that

54:48.079 --> 54:49.581
with my life lately.

54:49.622 --> 54:52.459
Start over
from scratch.

54:52.500 --> 54:55.086
Is that why you
left London?

54:55.128 --> 54:57.589
Yes.

54:57.630 --> 55:01.551
Too much history
and heartache.

55:01.593 --> 55:05.055
Now thinking instead of tearing
everything down and throwing

55:05.096 --> 55:09.684
it away, maybe I should restore
the parts that were beautiful.

55:12.270 --> 55:14.147
Did I tell you
I was a chef?

55:14.189 --> 55:17.233
You told me you
choose not to cook.

55:17.275 --> 55:19.194
So, you can
see my dilemma.

55:19.235 --> 55:21.112
(laughs)

55:21.154 --> 55:23.281
I wish I'd known you
were a chef earlier.

55:23.323 --> 55:24.616
You probably could
have helped me.

55:24.657 --> 55:26.076
With what?

55:26.117 --> 55:29.996
Oh, um, been trying to make a
turkey for Christmas dinner,

55:30.038 --> 55:31.998
for Jessica.

55:32.040 --> 55:36.961
Her mother used to do it, but
we haven't since she passed.

55:39.172 --> 55:41.549
I can't believe I'm
gonna tell you this.

55:41.591 --> 55:43.510
You don't have to tell me
anything you don't want to.

55:43.551 --> 55:45.970
Just promise
not to judge me.

55:46.012 --> 55:49.265
But I actually called that
Holiday Hotline for help.

55:49.307 --> 55:51.267
Well, let's
talk turkey!

55:51.309 --> 55:52.310
(nervous laugh)

55:52.352 --> 55:54.145
I know, it's
crazy, right?

55:54.187 --> 55:56.481
The thing is the woman
on the phone...

55:56.523 --> 56:00.485
she, she actually
really helped me.

56:00.527 --> 56:02.570
Yeah, in more
ways than one.

56:05.365 --> 56:07.200
You alright?

56:07.242 --> 56:08.618
Sorry.

56:08.660 --> 56:12.330
I...I think I had too
much of that spiced wine.

56:12.372 --> 56:14.249
I should probably
just go home.

56:14.290 --> 56:15.375
Yeah, that stuff
gets me, too.

56:15.417 --> 56:16.543
I can, I
can take you.

56:16.584 --> 56:18.253
No, thanks,
I'm fine.

56:18.294 --> 56:19.963
Taxi!

56:21.214 --> 56:23.008
Are you sure
you're okay?

56:23.049 --> 56:28.263
Oh, thanks for the tour,
and everything you shared.

56:28.304 --> 56:30.515
Means a lot to me.

56:30.557 --> 56:32.976
More than you know.

56:33.018 --> 56:34.936
Good night.

56:34.978 --> 56:36.271
Good night.

56:36.312 --> 56:37.647
(* mellow music *)

56:49.492 --> 56:51.036
Good gravy,
John is Jack?

56:51.077 --> 56:51.995
Are you, are
you kidding?

56:52.037 --> 56:53.163
I wish I were
kidding.

56:53.204 --> 56:54.372
I don't know
what to do.

56:54.414 --> 56:56.249
I should have told him
right then and there.

56:56.291 --> 56:57.876
Why didn't
I tell him?

56:57.917 --> 56:59.085
Okay, let me
ask you this.

56:59.127 --> 57:00.337
Which one of them do
you have feelings for?

57:00.378 --> 57:01.755
Both.
And who does Jack
have feelings for?

57:01.796 --> 57:03.131
I think both, too!

57:03.173 --> 57:04.758
Oh, that's the problem!

57:04.799 --> 57:05.717
He's gonna call
the hotline!

57:05.759 --> 57:06.926
I don't know
what to do.

57:06.968 --> 57:08.970
He trusts Peggy.
You're Peggy.

57:09.012 --> 57:11.097
No, I'm Abby.

57:11.139 --> 57:13.600
He can't handle a lie like
this, I know that now.

57:13.641 --> 57:15.727
Not after everything
he's been through.

57:18.772 --> 57:19.898
When he finds
out I'm Peggy,

57:19.939 --> 57:22.025
he's not going to trust
either of us again.

57:22.067 --> 57:24.152
We'll both lose him.

57:24.194 --> 57:26.196
Again, you're,
you're both you.

57:26.237 --> 57:28.990
Maybe when he calls, I
just shouldn't answer.

57:29.032 --> 57:33.161
Oh, well, I thought this hotline
was about turkeys, not chickens.

57:35.163 --> 57:37.957
Alright then, I'm going
to answer his call,

57:37.999 --> 57:39.959
help him make
that turkey,

57:40.001 --> 57:42.837
and then put
everything on the table.

57:42.879 --> 57:44.547
(* lighthearted music *)

57:45.882 --> 57:49.761
So, you're telling me you're
torn between a random voice

57:49.803 --> 57:55.975
on a phone, and an actual,
real-life, amazing woman?

57:56.017 --> 57:57.394
Yes.

57:57.435 --> 57:59.145
Peggy helped me
open up again.

57:59.187 --> 58:01.314
She helped me realize
that I could move on.

58:01.356 --> 58:02.982
Yeah, but isn't Abby
doing that, too?

58:03.024 --> 58:04.317
Yeah, but it's
different.

58:04.359 --> 58:06.194
I'm not even sure that Abby
wants whatever this is.

58:06.236 --> 58:07.487
Come on, I've seen the
two of you together.

58:07.529 --> 58:09.155
You have a real
connection.

58:09.197 --> 58:11.991
I have one with
Peggy, too.
Yeah.

58:12.033 --> 58:13.827
That's just over a
phone line though.

58:13.868 --> 58:15.704
Is that enough
for you?

58:16.955 --> 58:18.164
You're right.

58:18.206 --> 58:20.583
I need to know if what I
have with Peggy is real.

58:20.625 --> 58:22.502
I'll call her tomorrow,
make the turkey,

58:22.544 --> 58:26.006
then I'll lay it
all on the line.

58:26.047 --> 58:27.382
(* lighthearted music *)

58:41.104 --> 58:42.605
(* melodic music *)

58:49.029 --> 58:53.658
(phone ringing)

58:53.700 --> 58:55.994
Thank you for calling
the Holiday Hotline.

58:56.036 --> 58:57.245
Let's talk turkey!

58:57.287 --> 59:00.040
Hi, Peggy.
John, hi.

59:00.081 --> 59:01.916
Ready to make
some turkey?

59:01.958 --> 59:04.085
More than ready.

59:04.127 --> 59:05.837
Me, too.

59:08.214 --> 59:10.050
** La-la-la, la-la-la *

59:10.091 --> 59:11.885
* music *

59:11.926 --> 59:14.888
* Hey, yeah *

59:14.929 --> 59:20.226
* I never knew the
meaning of Christmas *

59:20.268 --> 59:26.107
* ‘till you came into my life *

59:26.149 --> 59:28.610
* I was lost in the dark *

59:28.651 --> 59:31.571
* ‘till you opened my heart *

59:31.613 --> 59:37.452
* Like an angel shining bright *

59:37.494 --> 59:40.372
* I wished on a star *

59:40.413 --> 59:41.748
* And girl here you are *

59:41.790 --> 59:43.917
Let's not let this
moment go to baste.

59:43.958 --> 59:45.752
* Suddenly I realize **

59:45.794 --> 59:48.254
What?
Let's not let this
moment go to baste.

59:48.296 --> 59:49.589
Get it?

59:49.631 --> 59:50.465
Get it?

59:50.507 --> 59:52.384
(screech gobble-gobble)

59:52.425 --> 59:54.636
Sorry, um,
dad joke again.

59:54.678 --> 59:58.098
Because baste
rhymes with...
Waste...I get it.

59:58.139 --> 59:59.265
I didn't realize,

59:59.307 --> 01:00:01.935
but I guess that one was
a real thinker, huh?

01:00:01.976 --> 01:00:03.770
I'm certainly
in thought.

01:00:03.812 --> 01:00:05.313
Listen, I need-
John, I need
to tell you.

01:00:05.355 --> 01:00:07.315
Cocoa emergency!

01:00:10.276 --> 01:00:11.778
Like Abby does it!

01:00:11.820 --> 01:00:13.446
Pleeease?

01:00:16.825 --> 01:00:19.828
Peggy, could I call
you back in five?

01:00:23.164 --> 01:00:24.916
So, how did it go?

01:00:24.958 --> 01:00:26.876
The bird is
in the oven.

01:00:26.918 --> 01:00:28.420
Is that code?

01:00:28.461 --> 01:00:31.548
No, it's actually
in the oven.
Oh.

01:00:31.589 --> 01:00:33.466
We never got to
talk about anything.

01:00:33.508 --> 01:00:36.136
He's going to call me
back in five minutes.

01:00:36.177 --> 01:00:37.303
(phone buzzing)

01:00:37.345 --> 01:00:38.847
It's Jack.

01:00:38.888 --> 01:00:39.973
How did he
get my number?

01:00:40.015 --> 01:00:41.266
Who cares.
Answer it.

01:00:41.307 --> 01:00:42.851
(phone buzzing)

01:00:43.768 --> 01:00:45.145
Hello?

01:00:45.186 --> 01:00:47.981
Abby, hi, it's Jack.

01:00:48.023 --> 01:00:50.066
Erica gave me
your number.

01:00:50.108 --> 01:00:51.026
I hope that's okay.

01:00:51.067 --> 01:00:52.902
Sure, of course.

01:00:52.944 --> 01:00:55.822
I wanted to check on
you after last night.

01:00:55.864 --> 01:00:58.408
Oh, I'm fine.

01:01:01.953 --> 01:01:03.621
Thank you.

01:01:03.663 --> 01:01:05.665
Sorry I left
so quickly.

01:01:05.707 --> 01:01:06.708
That's okay.

01:01:06.750 --> 01:01:08.418
So, you're
feeling better?

01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:09.961
Uh-huh.

01:01:10.003 --> 01:01:11.588
Good.

01:01:11.629 --> 01:01:14.007
Um, listen I have a turkey in
the oven and I'd really love it

01:01:14.049 --> 01:01:17.677
if you could come over
and try it when it's done.

01:01:17.719 --> 01:01:20.722
You want me
to taste it?

01:01:20.764 --> 01:01:23.850
Well, yeah, um,
you're a chef, right?

01:01:23.892 --> 01:01:25.894
Yes, but so is-

01:01:25.935 --> 01:01:27.937
Yes.

01:01:27.979 --> 01:01:29.856
I just, I just want to see
if you think it's good.

01:01:29.898 --> 01:01:32.859
There's not a doubt in
my mind that it will be.

01:01:32.901 --> 01:01:34.444
So, you'll come?

01:01:36.905 --> 01:01:38.198
I'd love to.

01:01:38.239 --> 01:01:41.284
I have a lot
to tell you.

01:01:41.326 --> 01:01:42.744
Me, too.

01:01:42.786 --> 01:01:44.371
I'll text you
the address.

01:01:44.412 --> 01:01:45.747
(* melodic music *)

01:01:49.918 --> 01:01:51.795
(phone ringing)

01:01:51.836 --> 01:01:54.714
Gobble, gobble, it's
the Holiday Hotline.

01:01:54.756 --> 01:01:59.761
Yes, between noon
and eight p.m.

01:01:59.803 --> 01:02:02.222
Well, I will, I
will let her know.

01:02:02.263 --> 01:02:03.932
Okay, bye.

01:02:06.267 --> 01:02:12.107
(clinking)

01:02:12.148 --> 01:02:13.608
It's been
fifteen minutes.

01:02:13.650 --> 01:02:15.193
Why hasn't John
called Peggy back?
Abby.

01:02:15.235 --> 01:02:17.112
Is he ghosting her?

01:02:17.153 --> 01:02:19.072
You're asking if the guy that
just asked you to his house

01:02:19.114 --> 01:02:21.032
is ghosting you?

01:02:21.074 --> 01:02:23.952
I just really wanted
closure with John first.

01:02:23.993 --> 01:02:26.329
Well, that's, that's
not gonna happen today.

01:02:26.371 --> 01:02:28.748
That was John.

01:02:28.790 --> 01:02:31.209
He wanted to leave Peggy, you, a
message that he would call her,

01:02:31.251 --> 01:02:37.048
you, on the Hotline tomorrow,
and tell her, you, how it went.

01:02:37.090 --> 01:02:39.259
How it went
with the turkey?

01:02:39.300 --> 01:02:42.178
Or you.

01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:45.098
So, Peggy's
his backup?

01:02:45.140 --> 01:02:49.310
You're jealous
of yourself?

01:02:49.352 --> 01:02:52.063
I know,
it's insane.

01:02:57.902 --> 01:02:59.112
(door bell chimes)

01:03:03.658 --> 01:03:05.452
Hey, come on in.

01:03:05.493 --> 01:03:06.286
Thanks.

01:03:06.327 --> 01:03:08.455
Um, I brought
this for you.

01:03:08.496 --> 01:03:10.123
Oh, thank you.

01:03:10.165 --> 01:03:12.667
It smells really
good in here, Jack.

01:03:12.709 --> 01:03:14.461
I think you did it!

01:03:14.502 --> 01:03:15.545
Well, we'll see.

01:03:15.587 --> 01:03:16.755
Hey, Abby!

01:03:16.796 --> 01:03:18.214
Happy Christmas, Abby!

01:03:18.256 --> 01:03:19.758
Jessica!

01:03:19.799 --> 01:03:23.428
Oh, in case we have
hot cocoa later.

01:03:23.470 --> 01:03:25.305
Thank you.

01:03:25.347 --> 01:03:26.473
Can we, dad?

01:03:26.514 --> 01:03:27.307
Absolutely.

01:03:27.349 --> 01:03:28.224
(ringing)

01:03:28.266 --> 01:03:29.601
Oh, there's
the timer.

01:03:29.642 --> 01:03:30.643
The turkey!

01:03:30.685 --> 01:03:32.395
Moment of truth.

01:03:32.437 --> 01:03:34.647
Oh, don't forget to let
it rest for 20 minutes.

01:03:34.689 --> 01:03:36.441
To let the
juices settle.

01:03:36.483 --> 01:03:38.151
Wow, look at you and
your turkey know-how.

01:03:38.193 --> 01:03:39.361
You probably could have worked
at that Holiday Hotline

01:03:39.402 --> 01:03:40.612
I called, huh?

01:03:40.653 --> 01:03:41.738
Ha! Right?

01:03:41.780 --> 01:03:43.239
No, that's...

01:03:43.281 --> 01:03:44.491
Sorry, what
was that?

01:03:44.532 --> 01:03:46.201
Nothing.

01:03:46.242 --> 01:03:47.535
(* melodic music *)

01:03:50.413 --> 01:03:51.664
You did it, Dad!

01:03:51.706 --> 01:03:53.750
Well, we don't
know that yet.

01:03:53.792 --> 01:03:55.669
I'm nervous.

01:03:55.710 --> 01:03:57.837
What if it's dry?

01:03:57.879 --> 01:03:59.422
Only one way
to find out.

01:04:03.593 --> 01:04:05.804
Okay, on three.

01:04:05.845 --> 01:04:09.724
One, two, three.

01:04:11.768 --> 01:04:13.395
Mmm.

01:04:13.436 --> 01:04:15.355
It's so good!

01:04:15.397 --> 01:04:16.606
Brilliant!

01:04:16.648 --> 01:04:18.650
Now we can have Christmas
dinner here, right?

01:04:18.692 --> 01:04:21.361
Absolutely.

01:04:21.403 --> 01:04:24.531
Um, would you
want to join us?

01:04:24.572 --> 01:04:27.534
I mean I, I know you don't have
any family here and my parents,

01:04:27.575 --> 01:04:29.536
they decided to go to
Florida early this year.

01:04:29.577 --> 01:04:32.038
So, it's just gonna
be Erica and Mike.

01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:33.540
And me!

01:04:33.581 --> 01:04:35.500
Oh, right, obviously.

01:04:35.542 --> 01:04:38.545
We're having Christmas
dinner at home, yes!

01:04:38.586 --> 01:04:39.838
(laughs)

01:04:41.589 --> 01:04:44.759
It, it wouldn't
be like a date.

01:04:44.801 --> 01:04:47.178
Unless you
wanted it to be.

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:48.888
But it, it
doesn't have to be.

01:04:48.930 --> 01:04:52.726
Look, um, I
should stop talking.

01:04:52.767 --> 01:04:53.810
I'd love to come.

01:04:55.937 --> 01:04:57.564
(* melodic music *)

01:04:59.691 --> 01:05:01.276
Is this okay?

01:05:01.317 --> 01:05:05.530
Very, but...
it's just...

01:05:05.572 --> 01:05:07.073
Too soon?

01:05:07.115 --> 01:05:09.743
It's complicated.
Right.

01:05:09.784 --> 01:05:10.702
It is for me, too.

01:05:13.288 --> 01:05:16.249
I just need a little more
time to figure things out.

01:05:16.291 --> 01:05:19.627
Is this the, um, the
thing back in London?

01:05:20.795 --> 01:05:24.174
Not really, no, um.

01:05:24.215 --> 01:05:27.510
Okay, but whatever
it is, I can wait.

01:05:31.306 --> 01:05:33.767
Did you tell that I,
I browned the turkey?

01:05:33.808 --> 01:05:35.268
Absolutely.

01:05:39.064 --> 01:05:40.648
(* lively music *)

01:05:49.741 --> 01:05:51.159
Hey, Jack.

01:05:51.201 --> 01:05:52.494
Party's in here.

01:05:52.535 --> 01:05:53.620
Are you coming?

01:05:53.661 --> 01:05:54.621
I'll be right there.

01:05:54.662 --> 01:05:55.538
I just have to
make a call first.

01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:57.332
Okay, well, don't
take too long.

01:05:57.374 --> 01:05:59.292
Rum balls are
almost gone.

01:05:59.334 --> 01:06:12.389
(background chatter)

01:06:15.225 --> 01:06:16.810
John on line four.

01:06:16.851 --> 01:06:18.853
(exhale)

01:06:18.895 --> 01:06:20.480
All right then.

01:06:20.522 --> 01:06:21.523
This is it.

01:06:23.900 --> 01:06:25.694
Hi, John.

01:06:25.735 --> 01:06:27.654
How was
the turkey?

01:06:27.696 --> 01:06:31.324
Perfect,
thanks to you.

01:06:31.366 --> 01:06:34.786
But, um, that's not
really why I'm calling.

01:06:38.415 --> 01:06:40.291
Ah, I don't know
where to start.

01:06:40.333 --> 01:06:41.751
Then I'll start.

01:06:41.793 --> 01:06:43.336
No.

01:06:43.378 --> 01:06:44.796
I have to
get this out.

01:06:47.507 --> 01:06:52.470
I wanted to call you one
last time and say thank you.

01:06:52.512 --> 01:06:55.515
You have no idea what a
difference you've made

01:06:55.557 --> 01:06:58.184
in my life.

01:06:58.226 --> 01:06:59.686
You made me realize
that I was ready.

01:07:01.146 --> 01:07:02.689
To make a turkey?

01:07:04.482 --> 01:07:09.237
That...and to open
my heart again.

01:07:13.450 --> 01:07:16.161
I've met
someone, Peggy.

01:07:16.202 --> 01:07:20.206
Um, someone I,
I really like.

01:07:20.248 --> 01:07:21.750
For the first time
in a long time.

01:07:23.293 --> 01:07:24.627
That's wonderful.

01:07:26.671 --> 01:07:29.966
I know that you and I had
a connection, too, but...

01:07:30.008 --> 01:07:33.470
You don't have
to explain, John.

01:07:33.511 --> 01:07:37.599
I really enjoyed
our talks.

01:07:37.640 --> 01:07:42.395
But...I have to tell
you the truth.

01:07:44.481 --> 01:07:45.940
(* melodic music *)

01:07:48.485 --> 01:07:50.153
I'm not who
you think I am.

01:07:50.195 --> 01:07:51.571
Oh, hey.

01:07:51.613 --> 01:07:55.283
I don't care what you look
like, or where you come from,

01:07:55.325 --> 01:07:58.203
or, or any of that.

01:07:58.244 --> 01:08:01.581
You know, to me,
you'll always be Peggy,

01:08:01.623 --> 01:08:04.834
the beautiful voice on
the phone who helped me

01:08:04.876 --> 01:08:06.753
open my heart again.

01:08:06.795 --> 01:08:09.422
That's all that matters.

01:08:13.468 --> 01:08:16.388
Merry Christmas, Peggy.

01:08:16.429 --> 01:08:21.351
And, um...thank you
again, for everything.

01:08:24.354 --> 01:08:26.356
Merry Christmas, John.

01:08:40.495 --> 01:08:44.082
So, what happened?

01:08:44.124 --> 01:08:45.834
He let Peggy go.

01:08:47.794 --> 01:08:51.214
Well, maybe it's time
you let her go, too.

01:08:51.256 --> 01:08:53.508
It's up to Abby
to come clean.

01:08:53.550 --> 01:08:55.010
(* melodic music *)

01:09:04.686 --> 01:09:05.895
Alright, Hotline,
one hour to go,

01:09:05.937 --> 01:09:08.148
then we hang up our
headsets for another season!

01:09:08.189 --> 01:09:10.150
(chatting in background)

01:09:10.191 --> 01:09:11.234
Holiday Hotline.

01:09:11.276 --> 01:09:12.777
Let's talk turkey.

01:09:14.362 --> 01:09:15.613
Hold on.

01:09:15.655 --> 01:09:18.366
Explain to me one more
time how this happened.

01:09:18.408 --> 01:09:20.785
Your kids put
what, where?

01:09:20.827 --> 01:09:23.079
I roasted it with
the cars inside!

01:09:24.456 --> 01:09:28.376
Oh, a turkey isn't
a garage, Henry!

01:09:30.128 --> 01:09:33.340
Whatever you do, do not put the
frozen turkey into boiling oil.

01:09:33.381 --> 01:09:35.675
Oh, well, then definitely if
you're having the family over,

01:09:35.717 --> 01:09:38.094
a turkey matzo
ball soup, my gosh.

01:09:38.136 --> 01:09:40.013
So, I don't have
any butcher's twine.

01:09:40.055 --> 01:09:42.349
Would it be okay if I used
Christmas ribbon instead?

01:09:42.390 --> 01:09:44.851
(laughs)

01:09:46.394 --> 01:09:47.979
You can do it.

01:09:48.021 --> 01:09:51.107
Well, use a shallow
roasting pan with a rack...

01:09:51.149 --> 01:09:53.276
Coat the turkey with
oil or cooking spray...

01:09:53.318 --> 01:09:56.112
White meat cooked to
165, dark meat to 180.

01:09:58.198 --> 01:10:01.326
No, I would definitely not
recommend using a chainsaw!

01:10:02.410 --> 01:10:04.329
What a plonker.

01:10:04.371 --> 01:10:05.997
Okay, this is it.

01:10:06.039 --> 01:10:09.876
Fifty-eight,
fifty-nine...two o'clock!

01:10:09.918 --> 01:10:11.378
Phone lines are
officially off.

01:10:11.419 --> 01:10:13.213
Hey, we did
it, everyone!

01:10:13.254 --> 01:10:14.714
Yeah!!!

01:10:14.756 --> 01:10:16.299
(cheering)

01:10:16.341 --> 01:10:17.467
(* uplifting music *)

01:10:21.763 --> 01:10:22.847
Thank you!

01:10:22.889 --> 01:10:25.600
Okay, everybody,
here we go.

01:10:25.642 --> 01:10:31.231
The award for greatest tragedy
averted...for talking a lady out

01:10:31.272 --> 01:10:35.193
of dropping an entire frozen
turkey into a deep fryer...

01:10:35.235 --> 01:10:36.403
(laughing)

01:10:36.444 --> 01:10:38.113
...Thelma!

01:10:38.154 --> 01:10:42.409
(cheering)

01:10:42.450 --> 01:10:43.827
Thank you!

01:10:43.868 --> 01:10:45.453
Let's get a
picture right here.

01:10:45.495 --> 01:10:50.417
And now for the
Best Newcomer.

01:10:50.458 --> 01:10:53.420
Well, who
else, Peggy!

01:10:53.461 --> 01:10:57.799
(cheering and clapping)

01:10:57.841 --> 01:11:02.012
Thank you, but Peggy
has left the building.

01:11:02.053 --> 01:11:03.179
(laughs)

01:11:06.141 --> 01:11:07.434
Jack...

01:11:07.475 --> 01:11:08.893
(* somber music *)

01:11:12.689 --> 01:11:13.982
Oh, um.

01:11:15.817 --> 01:11:18.778
Jack, wait, please!

01:11:18.820 --> 01:11:21.364
You knew I was John and
you didn't tell me?

01:11:21.406 --> 01:11:22.824
I wanted to, but-

01:11:22.866 --> 01:11:24.284
But you didn't.

01:11:24.325 --> 01:11:26.661
I trusted Peggy.

01:11:26.703 --> 01:11:28.413
I trusted you.

01:11:28.455 --> 01:11:30.457
Why would you
do that to me?

01:11:30.498 --> 01:11:31.958
After everything
we talked about?

01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.835
It's because of what
we talked about!

01:11:33.877 --> 01:11:36.129
I was afraid if I told
you, you'd give up,

01:11:36.171 --> 01:11:41.426
on Christmas dinner, on
opening up again and...on us.

01:11:43.345 --> 01:11:45.138
That I was
in too deep.

01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:46.806
I...

01:11:46.848 --> 01:11:48.683
That's why I
needed more time.

01:11:48.725 --> 01:11:51.269
Time for what?

01:11:51.311 --> 01:11:52.979
Hmm?

01:11:54.356 --> 01:11:58.818
For what it's worth, everything
I shared as Peggy was true.

01:11:58.860 --> 01:12:01.905
Those talks meant
the world to me.

01:12:01.946 --> 01:12:04.449
And I'll always be
grateful for that.

01:12:09.371 --> 01:12:10.872
I have to go.

01:12:10.914 --> 01:12:13.833
I have to get ready for
dinner tomorrow night.

01:12:13.875 --> 01:12:16.378
I'm assuming I'm
no longer invited.

01:12:18.338 --> 01:12:19.881
Huh.

01:12:23.051 --> 01:12:25.220
Merry Christmas, Peggy.

01:12:25.261 --> 01:12:26.680
Or Abby.

01:12:26.721 --> 01:12:28.056
Or whoever you are.

01:12:30.058 --> 01:12:31.976
Hey.

01:12:32.018 --> 01:12:34.062
You used
the name John.

01:12:34.104 --> 01:12:36.439
That didn't
help either!

01:12:36.481 --> 01:12:39.025
John is my name.

01:12:39.067 --> 01:12:40.860
Huh.

01:12:40.902 --> 01:12:43.029
When we started talking,
we weren't just strangers.

01:12:47.367 --> 01:12:49.786
I guess that much
hasn't changed, huh.

01:12:49.828 --> 01:12:51.246
(* somber music *)

01:13:06.344 --> 01:13:10.932
(phone buzzing)

01:13:12.434 --> 01:13:14.060
Hi, mum.

01:13:14.102 --> 01:13:15.687
Abigail, how are you?

01:13:15.729 --> 01:13:18.857
I'm fine but
you're up early.

01:13:18.898 --> 01:13:20.400
We've got some
exciting news.

01:13:20.442 --> 01:13:22.861
That chef friend of yours has
been trying to reach you.

01:13:22.902 --> 01:13:24.237
The handsome one.

01:13:24.279 --> 01:13:26.239
Yes, Diane,
she knows that.

01:13:26.281 --> 01:13:30.076
Something about a new venue is
opening up in Covent Garden.

01:13:30.118 --> 01:13:32.412
He's looking
for a head chef.

01:13:32.454 --> 01:13:33.747
He's looking
for you.

01:13:33.788 --> 01:13:35.248
Really?

01:13:35.290 --> 01:13:39.419
Well, I'll
think about it.

01:13:39.461 --> 01:13:41.921
I do miss home.

01:13:41.963 --> 01:13:45.425
And maybe
I'm ready now.

01:13:45.467 --> 01:13:47.177
To come back.

01:13:47.218 --> 01:13:51.306
Start something
fresh, where I belong.

01:13:51.348 --> 01:13:53.266
Mum: We do miss
you, darling.

01:13:53.308 --> 01:13:55.226
Dad: Yes, Christmas isn't
the same without you.

01:13:57.062 --> 01:13:59.189
You might not be
without me after all.

01:14:03.485 --> 01:14:05.195
I'm coming home.

01:14:11.284 --> 01:14:12.702
(* melodic music *)

01:14:32.931 --> 01:14:35.684
He wanted to
surprise you.

01:14:35.725 --> 01:14:37.310
Abby, are you okay?

01:14:37.352 --> 01:14:40.313
I didn't mean
to hurt him.

01:14:40.355 --> 01:14:44.984
I wanted to help
him and Jessica.

01:14:45.026 --> 01:14:48.822
I'm sorry...
Merry Christmas.

01:14:48.863 --> 01:14:50.782
Abby.
No, no.

01:14:52.951 --> 01:14:54.786
Just let her be.

01:14:54.828 --> 01:14:56.037
Come on.

01:14:57.956 --> 01:14:59.541
(* somber music *)

01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:14.889
Peggy, just a little
something to thank you for

01:15:14.931 --> 01:15:18.184
helping me find my
Merry Christmas again.

01:15:18.226 --> 01:15:22.313
All my best, John.

01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:43.835
p.s. My closest
friends call me "Jack".

01:15:43.877 --> 01:15:45.754
So, please do.

01:15:55.263 --> 01:15:56.639
(* melodic music *)

01:15:58.600 --> 01:16:00.435
What, you were just
gonna leave without

01:16:00.477 --> 01:16:01.978
saying goodbye?

01:16:02.020 --> 01:16:04.147
And you carried
your own luggage?

01:16:04.189 --> 01:16:05.482
That's my job!

01:16:05.523 --> 01:16:06.608
I'm so sorry.

01:16:06.649 --> 01:16:08.401
I, I thought you were
with your grandkids.

01:16:08.443 --> 01:16:10.403
I left you a note.

01:16:10.445 --> 01:16:12.072
I'll see my
family later.

01:16:12.113 --> 01:16:15.658
Right now I just wanted
to say how sorry I am.

01:16:15.700 --> 01:16:17.660
If I hadn't brought
you onto the hotline,

01:16:17.702 --> 01:16:19.037
and you told you
not to say anything,

01:16:19.079 --> 01:16:20.538
none of this mess
would've happened.

01:16:20.580 --> 01:16:22.665
It's not your
fault, Margaret.

01:16:22.707 --> 01:16:26.586
Jack and I just
weren't meant to be.

01:16:26.628 --> 01:16:29.214
Are you sure
about that?

01:16:32.509 --> 01:16:34.678
Well, this is me.

01:16:34.719 --> 01:16:38.056
Thank you for being so
kind to me, Margaret.

01:16:38.098 --> 01:16:41.351
And tell everyone in the
building I'll miss them.

01:16:41.393 --> 01:16:43.645
Merry Christmas.

01:16:43.687 --> 01:16:45.605
We're all sorry
to see you go.

01:16:50.735 --> 01:16:52.362
Merry
Christmas, Abby.

01:16:52.404 --> 01:16:53.822
(* heartfelt music *)

01:16:59.911 --> 01:17:01.287
Thank you.

01:17:06.251 --> 01:17:09.921
(phone buzzing)

01:17:11.381 --> 01:17:12.549
Hello?

01:17:12.590 --> 01:17:14.801
Abby?

01:17:14.843 --> 01:17:16.720
Jason?

01:17:16.761 --> 01:17:19.431
What number are
you calling from?

01:17:19.472 --> 01:17:20.724
A number you
haven't blocked yet.

01:17:20.765 --> 01:17:22.809
I can't believe
it worked!

01:17:22.851 --> 01:17:27.397
I...I heard about the
Covent Garden location.

01:17:27.439 --> 01:17:30.191
Oh, it's gonna be
absolutely brilliant.

01:17:30.233 --> 01:17:33.820
But you know I will need
someone who I can trust.

01:17:33.862 --> 01:17:35.822
Someone who knows
how I do things.

01:17:35.864 --> 01:17:39.117
Now, I realize that you'll
have some reservations,

01:17:39.159 --> 01:17:41.745
but this would be
strictly professional.

01:17:41.786 --> 01:17:45.331
I respect you for your
talent as a chef, Abby.

01:17:45.373 --> 01:17:49.586
Now we'd be business partners,
but you'd run the entire show.

01:17:49.627 --> 01:17:51.296
What do you think?

01:17:53.798 --> 01:17:57.344
You know, Abby, you're a
brilliant chef, I mean,

01:17:57.385 --> 01:18:00.722
you had me at the first taste
of your Yorkshire pudding.

01:18:00.764 --> 01:18:02.891
Don't you want to
cook for me again?

01:18:04.559 --> 01:18:06.603
No, Jason.

01:18:06.644 --> 01:18:08.646
Not for you.

01:18:08.688 --> 01:18:10.982
Happy Christmas.

01:18:19.407 --> 01:18:21.993
Help with your bags?

01:18:22.035 --> 01:18:24.204
How did you know
I wouldn't leave?

01:18:24.245 --> 01:18:25.455
I didn't!

01:18:25.497 --> 01:18:27.874
What am I, some kind of
magical Christmas fairy?

01:18:27.916 --> 01:18:29.626
(laughs)

01:18:29.668 --> 01:18:31.169
So, what are
you gonna do now?

01:18:32.504 --> 01:18:34.339
I'm going to cook.

01:18:36.424 --> 01:18:39.177
** See the snowflakes falling *

01:18:39.219 --> 01:18:41.971
* On your windowpane *

01:18:42.013 --> 01:18:45.266
* Then you hear the calling *

01:18:45.308 --> 01:18:47.811
* Folks to entertain *

01:18:47.852 --> 01:18:50.772
* Is it him who's calling *

01:18:50.814 --> 01:18:52.982
* Up into your chimney? *

01:18:53.024 --> 01:18:56.236
* Say, can you hear that choir *

01:18:56.277 --> 01:18:58.822
* And what they sing? *

01:18:58.863 --> 01:19:00.073
* Winter's coming *

01:19:00.115 --> 01:19:03.993
and here's hoping that
it'd going to stay *

01:19:04.035 --> 01:19:06.705
* ‘But if it's not,
then what the heck,

01:19:06.746 --> 01:19:09.207
it's still going to be OK' *

01:19:09.249 --> 01:19:12.669
This is it.
* cause I've always got you *

01:19:12.711 --> 01:19:15.964
* for a Christmas to
keep getting you **

01:19:16.589 --> 01:19:18.216
(* melodic music *)

01:19:24.764 --> 01:19:29.019
Mmm, mmm.

01:19:29.060 --> 01:19:32.522
This is
incredible, Abby.

01:19:32.564 --> 01:19:35.400
Peggy would
be proud!

01:19:35.442 --> 01:19:37.527
You're ready,
sweetheart.

01:19:37.569 --> 01:19:40.196
So, what, I just
show up at his door

01:19:40.238 --> 01:19:42.323
and hope he doesn't
slam it in my face?

01:19:42.365 --> 01:19:46.703
Don't worry, no man in his
right mind is gonna walk away

01:19:46.745 --> 01:19:50.457
from that Yorkshire
pudding...or you.

01:19:52.959 --> 01:19:56.421
That is the cutest shirt
I've ever seen you wear.

01:19:57.672 --> 01:19:59.591
Hey, you did it, Dad!

01:19:59.632 --> 01:20:01.301
Christmas
dinner at home!

01:20:01.343 --> 01:20:02.761
(* heartwarming music *)

01:20:03.845 --> 01:20:05.221
Isn't it great?

01:20:05.263 --> 01:20:06.639
It's amazing.

01:20:06.681 --> 01:20:07.724
Bravo.

01:20:07.766 --> 01:20:09.309
I didn't think
you had it in you.

01:20:09.351 --> 01:20:12.395
Well, you actually pulled it
off...with a little help from

01:20:12.437 --> 01:20:14.397
your friend
at the hotline.

01:20:14.439 --> 01:20:15.273
Where's Abby?

01:20:15.315 --> 01:20:16.441
When she
gonna be here?

01:20:16.483 --> 01:20:18.109
She's not
coming, sweetie.

01:20:18.151 --> 01:20:19.652
Why not?

01:20:19.694 --> 01:20:21.404
You invited her.

01:20:21.446 --> 01:20:22.572
And I set her a place.

01:20:22.614 --> 01:20:24.240
Nah.

01:20:24.282 --> 01:20:25.784
She should be here, Dad.

01:20:30.830 --> 01:20:32.415
She's right, you know.

01:20:35.293 --> 01:20:36.419
I got nothing.

01:20:36.461 --> 01:20:37.921
(* melodic music *)

01:20:43.635 --> 01:20:45.303
I need to see a
woman about a turkey.

01:20:47.138 --> 01:20:48.556
You know, before
she flies the-

01:20:48.598 --> 01:20:49.974
All: Just go!!!

01:20:50.016 --> 01:20:51.142
Right.

01:20:56.731 --> 01:20:59.776
Jack!

01:20:59.818 --> 01:21:02.112
I just wanted you to have
this for your dinner.

01:21:02.153 --> 01:21:03.488
It's Yorkshire
pudding.

01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:05.865
It's kind of
my specialty.

01:21:05.907 --> 01:21:08.702
When I came to Chicago, I
never wanted to make this,

01:21:08.743 --> 01:21:11.496
or anything, ever again.

01:21:11.538 --> 01:21:13.707
I lost my
love of cooking.

01:21:13.748 --> 01:21:16.376
But you changed that.

01:21:16.418 --> 01:21:19.796
You inspired me to want to help
people find the joy in it.

01:21:19.838 --> 01:21:21.798
And because of that,

01:21:21.840 --> 01:21:24.509
I rediscovered my
own joy of cooking.

01:21:24.551 --> 01:21:30.765
I found myself again and now I
know what I want in my life.

01:21:30.807 --> 01:21:33.184
It's all
because of you.

01:21:35.311 --> 01:21:37.605
Anyway, I, I was just
going to leave this here

01:21:37.647 --> 01:21:40.108
to say thank you.

01:21:40.150 --> 01:21:42.694
I wish I'd done
everything differently.

01:21:42.736 --> 01:21:46.573
I hope you can
forgive me, Jack.

01:21:46.614 --> 01:21:48.366
I was on my way
to find you.

01:21:49.576 --> 01:21:51.494
You were?

01:21:51.536 --> 01:21:55.707
I have to admit, that part was
a lot easier than I expected.

01:21:55.749 --> 01:21:57.000
(laughs)

01:21:58.168 --> 01:22:00.211
You were really
looking for me?

01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:05.175
I've been looking for
you for a long time.

01:22:05.216 --> 01:22:08.553
I know you weren't
entirely upfront with me.

01:22:08.595 --> 01:22:10.638
But I also know why.

01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:12.390
It wasn't intentional.

01:22:12.432 --> 01:22:17.187
And once I knew, I, I
didn't want to hurt you.

01:22:17.228 --> 01:22:20.482
The thing is you
didn't hurt me.

01:22:20.523 --> 01:22:22.400
You healed me.

01:22:24.235 --> 01:22:26.571
I don't want
this to be over.

01:22:26.613 --> 01:22:32.535
I don't care if you're Peggy
or Abby or Mrs. Claus herself.

01:22:32.577 --> 01:22:34.954
I'm falling in
love with you.

01:22:41.670 --> 01:22:46.716
(smooching)

01:22:46.758 --> 01:22:49.260
(knocking)

01:22:51.805 --> 01:22:54.808
(laughs)

01:22:54.849 --> 01:22:58.395
Merry
Christmas, Jack.

01:22:58.436 --> 01:23:00.146
Happy
Christmas, Abby.

01:23:05.777 --> 01:23:07.112
Merry Christmas!

01:23:07.153 --> 01:23:08.863
Merry Christmas,
Jessica!

01:23:08.905 --> 01:23:10.657
Where do we
get started?

01:23:10.699 --> 01:23:12.617
Merry Christmas!
How did you know Christmas
crackers were my favorite?

01:23:12.659 --> 01:23:14.119
Oh, my goodness.

01:23:14.160 --> 01:23:15.745
Wow, this
looks incredible!

01:23:15.787 --> 01:23:17.455
Did you see
what Jack made?

01:23:17.497 --> 01:23:19.374
Cheers.
Cheers.

01:23:19.416 --> 01:23:23.753
(chatting)

01:23:23.795 --> 01:23:25.338
To Abby.
To Abby.

01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:26.715
To Abby.
Abby.

01:23:26.756 --> 01:23:28.842
(glasses clinking)

01:23:28.883 --> 01:23:30.301
Merry Christmas
everybody!

01:23:36.933 --> 01:23:38.685

music *)
