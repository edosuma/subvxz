WEBVTT

00:13.883 --> 00:16.016
- I need you to back off.
This is a crime scene.

00:16.059 --> 00:18.018
Back off, give me space.

00:21.195 --> 00:24.198
5021, on scene.
Call is bona fide.

00:24.241 --> 00:26.417
I got one down--
- Over here, somebody!

00:26.461 --> 00:28.419
- Copy that, 5021--
- Hurry, please, please!

00:28.463 --> 00:29.681
- Over here.
Over here--hurry!

00:29.725 --> 00:31.335
- Okay, sir.
Hey, I'm the police here.

00:31.379 --> 00:33.424
Let me take a look.
Give me a little room.

00:33.468 --> 00:34.643
Hey...

00:34.686 --> 00:36.601
Hey, I'm gonna
open your coat, okay?

00:36.645 --> 00:39.082
Okay, I'm gonna
try to help you.

00:39.126 --> 00:41.084
Let's just take a look.
- Daddy.

00:41.128 --> 00:43.434
- Okay, sir, I need you
to focus on me.

00:43.478 --> 00:44.914
- Listen.

00:44.957 --> 00:47.264
We gotta stop air from getting
inside that wound,

00:47.308 --> 00:48.831
or the pressure's gonna
collapse her lungs.

00:48.874 --> 00:51.703
Do you understand?
Sir, I need you to focus!

00:51.747 --> 00:56.186
Find me a piece of plastic.
Help this man, go!

00:56.230 --> 00:58.058
I got you.

00:58.101 --> 01:00.973
5021, I got a tender-age GSW.

01:01.017 --> 01:04.238
West side of the field house.
Sucking chest wound.

01:04.281 --> 01:06.283
I need an ambulance
and some cars here now.

01:06.327 --> 01:08.372
- Copy that, 5021...
- Stay with me.

01:08.416 --> 01:12.376
That's it, just look at me.
I'm right here.

01:12.420 --> 01:13.508
- That's it.

01:13.551 --> 01:16.250
Try to breathe.
Relax.

01:21.864 --> 01:23.561
Any witnesses?
- A few.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.607
Including those members
of the Rollin' Avers gang.

01:25.650 --> 01:28.436
Surprise, surprise,
they didn't see a damn thing.

01:28.479 --> 01:30.394
- Everybody in this park
gets documented.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.788
Either a gang card
or a contact card, understand?

01:32.831 --> 01:34.398
- Copy that.
- Hey, the hell you going?

01:34.442 --> 01:36.096
You think that red tape's up
so we can play limbo?

01:38.359 --> 01:41.449
- Hank Voight, Intelligence.
- Paul Staples, Homicide.

01:41.492 --> 01:44.147
- Yeah, I was first on scene.
I found the girl.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.280
- Thanks for that.
It's appreciated.

01:46.323 --> 01:48.760
We got it from here.

01:48.804 --> 01:51.415
- Listen, I'm taking the case.
Just wanna let you know--

01:51.459 --> 01:53.287
save you some time
and paperwork.

01:53.330 --> 01:56.159
- See this guy here,
he's--he's dead.

01:56.203 --> 01:58.074
That means murder police
take on the investigation.

01:58.118 --> 02:00.468
- "Murder police"?

02:00.511 --> 02:01.817
Let me tell you something.

02:01.860 --> 02:03.340
I was holding that
little girl in my arms.

02:05.429 --> 02:08.650
I had my hand inside her chest,
you understand?

02:08.693 --> 02:12.393
There's no way
I'm walking away from this, so.

02:12.436 --> 02:15.135
So why don't you save
the speech, get off my scene.

02:15.178 --> 02:16.440
- Hey, who the hell
do you think you are?

02:16.484 --> 02:18.138
- Are you out of your mind?

02:18.181 --> 02:20.488
- Hey, Sarge, what's up?
We good?

02:23.317 --> 02:26.320
Yeah, we're good.

02:29.932 --> 02:32.239
- Hell was that about?

02:32.282 --> 02:35.198
- All right, we got one down.

02:35.242 --> 02:39.071
And one tender-age female
en route to Med.

02:39.115 --> 02:42.292
- Gang shooting gone bad?

02:42.336 --> 02:45.991
- It sure looks that way.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.607
Got an update on the girl?
- Yeah.

02:52.650 --> 02:54.609
Willa Marie James,
Ten years old.

02:54.652 --> 02:56.567
Was walking out
of a field house,

02:56.611 --> 02:59.483
from orchestra rehearsal, when
she caught the stray bullet.

02:59.527 --> 03:02.007
One in a million, Sarge.
She's out of surgery,

03:02.051 --> 03:04.227
stable but critical.
Family's with her.

03:04.271 --> 03:07.230
- Deceased male
is Brooks Campbell, 33.

03:07.274 --> 03:08.492
Identified and documented as

03:08.536 --> 03:11.016
the head of
the Rollin' Avers gang.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.670
- So we convinced exactly
one witness to talk.

03:12.714 --> 03:15.891
Said the shooter walked
straight up, fired, and ran.

03:15.934 --> 03:18.285
But the guy was totally covered
up--gloves, hoodie, jacket.

03:18.328 --> 03:20.156
Couldn't tell what race he was.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.549
Couldn't even tell
if he was a he.

03:21.592 --> 03:24.029
- Hell of a witness.
- Well, he did give us

03:24.073 --> 03:27.250
one thing, though.
Said the shooter fled the scene

03:27.294 --> 03:29.992
in an old-school Pontiac,
an Aztec.

03:30.035 --> 03:31.559
No plates, though.
- There's not many of those

03:31.602 --> 03:32.821
on the road.
I just put out a BOLO.

03:32.864 --> 03:34.779
- Any casings
recovered at the scene?

03:34.823 --> 03:36.390
We hear back from Ballistics?
- There's nothing yet,

03:36.433 --> 03:37.956
I'm gonna stay on.
- Okay, good.

03:38.000 --> 03:39.915
Meantime, let's dig
into this rival gang theory.

03:39.958 --> 03:41.525
- I talked to the gang unit.

03:41.569 --> 03:42.874
They said that the Rollin'
Avers' biggest rival

03:42.918 --> 03:44.224
is the West Side Jokers.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.226
They deal dope on
the other side of Emerald Ave.

03:46.269 --> 03:48.358
They used to beef, but they've
been quiet for a while.

03:48.402 --> 03:49.577
- Well, it ain't quiet now.

03:49.620 --> 03:50.578
Someone just walked
in their front yard,

03:50.621 --> 03:51.927
took out their top guy.

03:51.970 --> 03:53.320
Listen, we don't move fast,

03:53.363 --> 03:55.017
we got a gang war on our hands,
you understand?

03:55.060 --> 03:57.367
All those people out there
who wouldn't talk to us?

03:57.411 --> 03:59.326
They all know more than we do.

03:59.369 --> 04:01.371
You can bet
they all want revenge, too.

04:01.415 --> 04:03.330
- Sarge, POD footage
from the park.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.723
Caught some of the action.

04:07.203 --> 04:09.553
- So you can't see
the shooter--he's off screen--

04:09.597 --> 04:11.381
but there's Brooks Campbell,

04:11.425 --> 04:12.861
leaning against
the fence there.

04:12.904 --> 04:15.124
See, he gets hit
with the first shot.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.430
And then the guy
unloads five more,

04:16.473 --> 04:18.258
gets Willa in the back there.

04:18.301 --> 04:20.956
But check this guy out,
on the side here.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.740
So he's just standing there.

04:22.784 --> 04:24.699
He's got a clear view
of the whole thing.

04:24.742 --> 04:26.309
- Hold on, I talked
to him at the park.

04:26.353 --> 04:27.484
- Mm-hmm.
- Remember the guy?

04:27.528 --> 04:28.616
- Yeah.
- "Didn't see a damn thing."

04:28.659 --> 04:30.661
- Okay, we got a name
for this guy?

04:30.705 --> 04:32.924
- Yeah, it's Lamar Garrison--
Brooks Campbell's number two.

04:55.686 --> 04:57.297
- Take it easy.
I'm the police.

04:57.340 --> 04:59.908
- Oh, word?
You don't say.

05:02.258 --> 05:05.043
- It's nice to meet you, Lamar.

05:05.087 --> 05:06.393
Sergeant Hank Voight.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.743
I wanna talk about
that shooting last night.

05:09.657 --> 05:11.223
- Yeah, we took a hit.

05:11.267 --> 05:13.965
You know, Brooks Campbell was
the man around here, so...

05:14.009 --> 05:15.880
We hurting.

05:15.924 --> 05:18.970
- Well, I wanna know
what you saw.

05:19.014 --> 05:20.972
- Nothing.
I already told y'all that.

05:21.016 --> 05:23.497
- Yeah, I know you did.

05:23.540 --> 05:25.499
Thing is, I also know
you were lying.

05:27.501 --> 05:29.851
Talk in private?

05:29.894 --> 05:32.810
- I got nothing to hide.
- Okay.

05:36.423 --> 05:38.947
Lamar.

05:41.863 --> 05:44.213
We got you on video,
watching the shooting,

05:44.256 --> 05:48.609
so unless you're blind,
you saw who murdered your boss,

05:48.652 --> 05:51.525
your friend, Brooks Campbell.

05:51.568 --> 05:54.005
- Look, we all was there,
all right?

05:54.049 --> 05:56.356
I must have been looking
other way, 'cause like I said,

05:56.399 --> 05:59.489
I didn't see nothing.
- Mm-hmm.

05:59.533 --> 06:02.013
Listen.
Brooks--

06:02.057 --> 06:05.843
I mean, he's lying
on a slab at the morgue.

06:05.887 --> 06:08.019
I got a little girl
hanging on by a thread,

06:08.063 --> 06:10.848
ten years old, civilian.

06:10.892 --> 06:12.502
So we're gonna be
all over this neighborhood

06:12.546 --> 06:15.679
till we have
that shooter in custody.

06:15.723 --> 06:18.334
It's gonna be real hard
selling drugs

06:18.378 --> 06:21.293
with all that blue around.

06:21.337 --> 06:24.384
- You know,
I'd really like to help,

06:24.427 --> 06:26.908
but I didn't see nothing.
Mm-mm.

06:28.475 --> 06:31.303
- You know, I got a feeling...

06:31.347 --> 06:36.439
I got a feeling we're gonna
be seeing each other around.

06:36.483 --> 06:38.528
Mm-hmm.

06:44.752 --> 06:46.275
- Hurry up and get in the van.

06:46.318 --> 06:48.712
- Yeah.
- Come on.

06:49.670 --> 06:51.454
- Come on, man.

06:53.325 --> 06:56.894
- Everybody in?
Good?

07:03.466 --> 07:05.076
- Don't take my word for it.

07:05.120 --> 07:07.731
You know who agreed with me?
Albert Einstein.

07:07.775 --> 07:09.254
I mean, they put him aside
and they said,

07:09.298 --> 07:11.431
"Al, what is the most powerful
force in the universe?"

07:11.474 --> 07:12.649
Now, he could've said anything.

07:12.693 --> 07:14.477
He could've said,
gravity, nuclear energy...

07:14.521 --> 07:17.437
Hell, he could have
said love.

07:17.480 --> 07:20.440
What did he say?
"Compound interest."

07:20.483 --> 07:21.745
Now, simple interest--

07:21.789 --> 07:23.443
that's like putting
your money in a shoebox.

07:23.486 --> 07:25.401
Let it sit for a year,
you come back,

07:25.445 --> 07:28.665
you got the same money,
only it smells like your shoes.

07:28.709 --> 07:30.014
Compound interest--

07:30.058 --> 07:31.929
that's interest
on your interest.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.931
That's like a stone
rolling downhill.

07:33.975 --> 07:37.500
Your money grows
faster and faster, yeah?

07:37.544 --> 07:39.720
Hank Voight,

07:39.763 --> 07:41.504
come on in here, man.
- How you doing, Frank?

07:41.548 --> 07:42.766
- Hey--
Hey, yo.

07:42.810 --> 07:46.466
Yo, this man right here?
This man right here--

07:46.509 --> 07:48.119
Whoo!
- Hey, my friend.

07:48.163 --> 07:49.947
- Hey.

07:49.991 --> 07:52.559
- How are you?
- Yo, hey.

07:52.602 --> 07:55.300
He saved my life.
You know how he did it?

07:55.344 --> 07:58.173
He put me in prison.
And trust me when I tell you,

07:58.216 --> 07:59.653
there are better ways
to be saved.

07:59.696 --> 08:01.568
- Now that's the truth.
- Right.

08:01.611 --> 08:02.873
Okay, look here.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.962
Y'all, you guys give us
five minutes, okay?

08:05.006 --> 08:07.138
Hey, let's move it along
a little bit.

08:07.182 --> 08:10.098
I never give y'all a five.
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

08:10.141 --> 08:12.492
- Ah, still doing
your thing.

08:12.535 --> 08:13.928
- Yeah, I'm just trying
to save lives.

08:13.971 --> 08:15.799
I got a steady stream
of clients, you can see.

08:15.843 --> 08:18.541
- Yeah.
You keeping your hands clean?

08:18.585 --> 08:20.238
- Oh, I was innocent
back then, too.

08:20.282 --> 08:22.632
- Yeah, of course you were.

08:22.676 --> 08:26.157
So, okay.
You here for a prayer?

08:26.201 --> 08:28.333
- You know what, in a way.
- Mm-hmm.

08:28.377 --> 08:30.510
- I assume you heard about
that shooting last night?

08:30.553 --> 08:33.469
- Ooh, damn shame.
- You're right.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.992
Look, I came in
'cause I know

08:35.036 --> 08:38.343
you got the ear of the kids
in this neighborhood.

08:38.387 --> 08:40.650
I'm wondering if you know a guy
named Lamar Garrison.

08:41.956 --> 08:43.435
- Lamar Garrison?
- Mm-hmm.

08:43.479 --> 08:45.002
- Yeah, I know him well.
- Really?

08:45.046 --> 08:46.569
- Yeah, he had a hard road.
- Huh.

08:46.613 --> 08:49.833
- His mother overdosed
a few years back.

08:49.877 --> 08:53.184
Early on, he would sleep
a-a couple times a week

08:53.228 --> 08:54.969
right here in the church
when things got rougher.

08:55.012 --> 08:56.579
- Really?
- But Lamar--

08:56.623 --> 08:59.756
He's made some choices
in his life, but this?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.106
Hmm, I don't think
he's mixed up in this.

09:02.150 --> 09:04.282
- Well, yes and no.

09:04.326 --> 09:07.198
I mean, he didn't
pull the trigger, but...

09:07.242 --> 09:09.331
we got video confirms
he was in the park

09:09.374 --> 09:10.724
and saw the guy who did.

09:10.767 --> 09:13.944
And he's lying to us about it.
He won't cooperate.

09:13.988 --> 09:15.337
- Well, that's not
the first time that's happened.

09:17.861 --> 09:21.038
- But this case
is different, man.

09:21.082 --> 09:23.388
I got a ten-year-old girl
in critical condition.

09:23.432 --> 09:24.738
- I heard.

09:24.781 --> 09:26.696
It hurts, because I
love this neighborhood.

09:26.740 --> 09:29.046
- I know you do.
Hell.

09:29.090 --> 09:32.223
You ran this neighborhood
for, what, ten years?

09:32.267 --> 09:34.530
- Yeah, I had a good run,
till you came along.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.445
- Uh-huh.

09:36.488 --> 09:38.795
Frank, shooting like this--
you know what happens next.

09:38.839 --> 09:42.886
I mean, Brooks Campbell--
he's big game out there.

09:42.930 --> 09:44.496
Bro, there's a good chance

09:44.540 --> 09:46.063
the West Side Jokers
are behind this.

09:46.107 --> 09:47.891
- Oh.

09:47.935 --> 09:50.241
- We are staring down
a full-on gang war right now.

09:50.285 --> 09:53.984
Neither one of us want that.

09:54.028 --> 09:56.334
- Okay, how can I help?

09:56.378 --> 09:57.901
- Talk to Garrison.

09:57.945 --> 09:59.860
Get him to cooperate
with our investigation.

09:59.903 --> 10:02.166
Tell him put his pride
on the shelf.

10:02.210 --> 10:04.734
Let us do our jobs.

10:04.778 --> 10:07.432
Frank, he's lying to us
because he wants payback.

10:07.476 --> 10:10.261
Now let me tell you something.

10:10.305 --> 10:12.742
He goes out there, starts
shooting up rival bangers,

10:12.786 --> 10:14.875
he's gonna end up
one of two ways:

10:14.918 --> 10:17.268
dead or in prison for life.

10:17.312 --> 10:20.054
- Hank, these young bangers
don't listen.

10:20.097 --> 10:21.446
They don't respect
the older generation.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.840
They think they know it all.
- Listen to me.

10:23.884 --> 10:26.103
I know you can do this.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.062
Look, I'm not
asking you to snitch.

10:28.105 --> 10:31.718
I just need a name.
I don't care about Garrison.

10:31.761 --> 10:35.460
I'm trying to save lives,
prevent a war, that's all.

10:35.504 --> 10:38.115
Listen to me--off the record--
you deliver Garrison,

10:38.159 --> 10:42.119
you get him to cooperate
with our investigation,

10:42.163 --> 10:45.993
I'd gladly make a $1,000
donation to this church.

10:47.472 --> 10:50.432
- You double that,
and you got a deal.

10:50.475 --> 10:52.739
- Still a thief.

10:52.782 --> 10:54.436
- I'm glad you haven't changed.

10:56.525 --> 10:58.266
Yeah.

10:58.309 --> 11:02.096
Save some lives, yeah?
- Yeah.

11:02.139 --> 11:04.707
Oh, my God.

11:04.751 --> 11:07.188
- What?

11:07.231 --> 11:10.104
- The little girl,
Willa James...

11:11.714 --> 11:14.369
She just died.

11:32.300 --> 11:35.172
- Stay warm, kittens.

11:39.220 --> 11:41.875
- She just call us kittens?
- Think so.

11:48.533 --> 11:51.362
- They're in position, right on
top of them with a great eye.

12:04.375 --> 12:06.726
- Garrison's here.

12:22.045 --> 12:23.612
- Lamar, good to see you.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.440
- All right.
- Come on in.

12:26.484 --> 12:28.182
- Going inside.

12:28.225 --> 12:30.706
- Copy.
You have visuals?

12:30.750 --> 12:33.491
- Look, the cops have been
snooping around.

12:33.535 --> 12:34.797
- Wait, so I'm confused.

12:34.841 --> 12:36.494
So now you're talking
to the police?

12:36.538 --> 12:37.713
- Who said that?
- You.

12:37.757 --> 12:38.975
- We're up.

12:39.019 --> 12:40.107
- You got bad ears.

12:40.150 --> 12:41.804
I ain't working
with the police.

12:41.848 --> 12:42.936
I ain't never worked
with the police

12:42.979 --> 12:44.589
and never will neither.

12:44.633 --> 12:45.808
- You just said that
you was talking to them--

12:45.852 --> 12:47.157
- What I said was
that the cops came

12:47.201 --> 12:48.855
to ask me questions
about you and your crew.

12:48.898 --> 12:51.074
They seem to think
you saw the shooter.

12:51.118 --> 12:53.337
- If I did, I sure ain't
telling them.

12:53.381 --> 12:54.904
- I know that.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.297
Sit down.

12:58.516 --> 13:01.911
Look here.
I know you're a man of pride.

13:01.955 --> 13:04.435
You want vengeance.

13:04.479 --> 13:05.828
- There ain't
nothing wrong with that.

13:05.872 --> 13:08.439
- Son, there's everything
wrong with that.

13:08.483 --> 13:10.659
Brooks is gone; you're gonna
need a fresh start,

13:10.702 --> 13:12.704
a strong start,
not a war on the streets,

13:12.748 --> 13:14.924
not a million questions
about some little dead girl.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.839
You don't want that heat.

13:16.883 --> 13:18.536
And if you don't handle
your business

13:18.580 --> 13:21.713
right now, right here,

13:21.757 --> 13:23.498
your little reign as
leader of the Rollin' Avers

13:23.541 --> 13:25.717
will be over before
it ever gets started.

13:25.761 --> 13:30.331
So I'm offering you
another path, a rebirth.

13:30.374 --> 13:32.899
Don't do it for the police,
you do it for you.

13:36.250 --> 13:41.298
Hey, I need a name.

13:42.647 --> 13:44.432
I need to know who killed
Brooks Campbell

13:44.475 --> 13:46.347
and Willa James.

13:50.394 --> 13:52.396
Can't get back to me.

13:52.440 --> 13:53.833
- It won't.

13:53.876 --> 13:56.792
The whole point of this
is that it don't fall on you.

13:56.836 --> 13:59.926
I give it to the police
so that you can live your life.

14:06.976 --> 14:08.804
JoJo McGinnis.

14:11.546 --> 14:13.461
- JoJo McGinnis?

14:13.504 --> 14:15.506
- Thought he was gonna
shoot me too.

14:15.550 --> 14:18.683
- There it is.
- All right, you heard the man.

14:18.727 --> 14:20.598
- I think I've heard of JoJo.

14:20.642 --> 14:22.644
He calls shots for
the West Side Jokers.

14:22.687 --> 14:25.125
- Huh.
So it's like we thought--

14:25.168 --> 14:27.649
Jokers are behind this.

14:27.692 --> 14:29.433
All right, nail down
where this JoJo is,

14:29.477 --> 14:33.002
and let's pay him a visit.

14:42.490 --> 14:44.274
- Guy's reaching.
He's reaching.

14:44.318 --> 14:46.146
Gun, gun, gun!
- It's the police!

14:46.189 --> 14:48.235
- I'll go around--

14:48.278 --> 14:49.801
Hey!

14:51.194 --> 14:52.630
Against the wall!

14:53.805 --> 14:55.633
- Hey!
- Stop! Stop!

14:55.677 --> 14:57.157
- Chicago police!
- Drop the gun!

14:57.200 --> 14:58.723
- Drop--what are you doing?
Don't do that!

14:58.767 --> 14:59.942
- Hands up! Hands up!
- Get on the ground!

14:59.986 --> 15:01.030
- Drop the gun!
- Hands up, hands up!

15:01.074 --> 15:02.379
- JoJo McGinnis!
Where are you going?

15:02.423 --> 15:03.728
- Stay down.

15:16.785 --> 15:18.918
Police!

15:28.057 --> 15:30.407
We done, JoJo?
Or you wanna keep going?

15:30.451 --> 15:32.366
Roll over, put your hands
behind your back.

15:32.409 --> 15:35.369
Roll over!
- All right, man.

15:35.412 --> 15:36.631
- You got anything on you?

15:36.674 --> 15:39.677
- No, man.
Ow, man!

15:39.721 --> 15:41.114
- Offender in custody.

15:41.157 --> 15:42.158
- Yeah, copy that.

15:42.202 --> 15:45.422
- Get up, get up.
Go.

15:46.597 --> 15:49.035
- Found that at your place.

15:49.078 --> 15:51.559
Ran some tests,
it's a very serious narcotic.

15:51.602 --> 15:52.908
2C-B, party drug.

15:52.952 --> 15:56.651
- Yeah, and it weighed in
north of 15 grams.

15:56.694 --> 16:00.350
That's a minimum six years,
with weapons.

16:00.394 --> 16:03.788
Gives us plenty of time to hit
you with the murders too.

16:03.832 --> 16:07.053
- Murders?
- The shooting last night.

16:07.096 --> 16:09.577
You know, the one that killed
Brooks Campbell

16:09.620 --> 16:11.579
and Willa James.

16:11.622 --> 16:13.494
Ten-year-old Willa James.

16:13.537 --> 16:15.409
- Whoa, man.

16:15.452 --> 16:16.801
I wasn't involved
in any of that.

16:16.845 --> 16:18.716
- We're a little cynical, JoJo.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.457
So you might wanna give us
more than that.

16:20.501 --> 16:23.417
- Look,
I liked Brooks Campbell.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.462
We were making bank
in that park,

16:25.506 --> 16:27.421
talking about going
into business together.

16:27.464 --> 16:30.859
I had no reason to harm him.
None.

16:30.902 --> 16:34.341
- Okay, so where were you
last night?

16:34.384 --> 16:37.213
- Out with some friends.
- Tell us where.

16:39.259 --> 16:42.044
- I can't.
- I figured.

16:42.088 --> 16:45.874
So we hit him with the drugs,
the weapons,

16:45.917 --> 16:48.094
and we'll just keep
investigating the murder.

16:48.137 --> 16:50.139
- Okay, man, okay.

16:50.183 --> 16:52.837
But you can't tell nobody.

16:52.881 --> 16:55.797
The people in my line of work
aren't so understanding.

16:55.840 --> 16:57.886
- Just tell us
where you were, JoJo.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.761
- Thanks.

17:03.805 --> 17:05.285
Hey, Sarge.
- Yeah.

17:05.328 --> 17:06.851
- I just got off the phone with
the manager of The Flame.

17:06.895 --> 17:08.679
- Huh.
- And JoJo's telling the truth.

17:08.723 --> 17:10.290
He was there from
7:00 to 10:00.

17:10.333 --> 17:11.856
There's video.
It's a bust.

17:11.900 --> 17:13.815
- It keeps coming back
to Lamar Garrison.

17:13.858 --> 17:15.077
- I mean, the only thing we
know for sure

17:15.121 --> 17:17.775
is that Garrison didn't do it,
from the video.

17:17.819 --> 17:20.865
- Yeah, but he keeps
lying about it, you know?

17:20.909 --> 17:22.911
He lied to us at the scene,
and he lied to Frank

17:22.954 --> 17:24.434
when he ID'd the wrong shooter.

17:24.478 --> 17:25.827
- Do you wanna bring
Garrison in?

17:25.870 --> 17:28.699
- No, we do that,
it burns Frank as our CI.

17:28.743 --> 17:30.614
It's a death sentence.

17:30.658 --> 17:32.138
- Then we don't have a case.

17:32.181 --> 17:34.357
And there's nothing on
the getaway car, either.

17:34.401 --> 17:36.881
We're back to square one.
- All right, grab Hailey,

17:36.925 --> 17:39.101
hit the streets,
just start knocking on doors.

17:39.145 --> 17:40.668
See if we can figure out
what was going on in

17:40.711 --> 17:42.191
that neighborhood
before the shootings.

17:42.235 --> 17:44.193
- All right.

17:50.895 --> 17:52.854
- So the Jokers run
the west side of the park.

17:52.897 --> 17:55.117
The Avers, the east side.
We got a bunch of teenagers

17:55.161 --> 17:56.814
pumped up on
testosterone and pride,

17:56.858 --> 17:58.120
slinging dope right next
to each other.

17:58.164 --> 17:59.817
- Yeah, what could
possibly go wrong?

17:59.861 --> 18:03.299
- And these poor people live
right on the seams of it.

18:03.343 --> 18:04.170
- How you guys doing today?

18:06.085 --> 18:07.477
Get inside!

18:09.175 --> 18:11.307
Police!
Stop!

18:17.096 --> 18:18.358
Police!
Get your hands out of the car!

18:18.401 --> 18:19.576
- Hands up, now!

18:19.620 --> 18:20.969
- Get your hands
out of the car, now!

18:21.012 --> 18:23.058
- Okay, okay.
- You even blink,

18:23.102 --> 18:24.320
we will shoot you.
- Don't move!

18:24.364 --> 18:26.714
- Get out of the car.
On the ground, now.

18:26.757 --> 18:28.150
On the ground, face down.
You got me?

18:28.194 --> 18:29.978
- Yeah.
- Get on the ground, face down.

18:30.021 --> 18:31.893
Do not move!
- 5021 Henry,

18:31.936 --> 18:33.373
we got shots fired,
two offenders in custody--

18:36.071 --> 18:38.247
- You got this?
- Yeah, I'm good, go.

18:38.291 --> 18:40.858
5021 George, shots fired.
600 block of Wells,

18:40.902 --> 18:45.167
Dolton Park.
- He's dead!

18:45.211 --> 18:48.431
He's dead!

18:48.475 --> 18:51.956
They shot my little boy!

18:52.000 --> 18:56.222
No!
No!

18:56.265 --> 18:59.225
He's dead!

19:04.708 --> 19:06.188
- Sarge.
- Go.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.711
- DOA is Tyler Hamilton,
17 years old.

19:07.755 --> 19:10.192
Well-known member
with the West Side Jokers.

19:10.236 --> 19:11.541
- Shooters?
- Two up-and-comers

19:11.585 --> 19:12.934
with the Rollin' Avers.
- They're downstairs

19:12.977 --> 19:14.544
being processed.
Both juveniles.

19:14.588 --> 19:18.331
- War's officially on, Sarge.
- Hmm.

19:18.374 --> 19:19.941
All right, put this
in my desk.

19:19.984 --> 19:22.596
Call holding, have them send
JoJo up to Interview One.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.212
Hey, JoJo.

19:30.256 --> 19:33.737
You can unhook him.

19:33.781 --> 19:36.784
I have bad news, bro.

19:36.827 --> 19:40.831
Rollin' Avers just shot
your boy Tyler Hamilton.

19:40.875 --> 19:43.791
He's dead.
Sit down.

19:48.491 --> 19:51.451
- That ain't right, man.
- Yeah, it is.

19:51.494 --> 19:54.280
It's payback for what your
people did to Brooks Campbell.

19:54.323 --> 19:56.151
- I told you, man.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.805
We weren't involved
in any of that.

19:57.848 --> 20:00.329
- That may or may not be true,
but either way,

20:00.373 --> 20:03.419
you are gonna tell your people
to stand down.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.116
- They just killed
my boy Tyler.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.944
- And yet,
you're gonna move on.

20:06.988 --> 20:08.859
- I can't move on.
- Mm-hmm.

20:08.903 --> 20:11.601
- And I damn sure can't
control my crew.

20:11.645 --> 20:14.648
One of them wanna do work,
that's on them, not me.

20:16.867 --> 20:20.784
- Would you give us
a little privacy, Lawrence?

20:20.828 --> 20:24.571
All right, let me put it
to you this way.

20:24.614 --> 20:28.444
I gotta tell you,
personally, I don't give a damn

20:28.488 --> 20:30.490
what you do with
your free time, really.

20:30.533 --> 20:34.189
Long as you don't hurt anybody,
it's none of my business.

20:34.233 --> 20:36.278
But I promise you this.

20:36.322 --> 20:38.541
Your crew so much
as lights a firecracker

20:38.585 --> 20:41.370
on the east side
of Dolton Park,

20:41.414 --> 20:44.286
I will make sure your less
enlightened associates

20:44.330 --> 20:47.463
get a copy of that videotape.
You understand?

20:47.507 --> 20:50.161
Know what I'm talking about?

20:50.205 --> 20:54.992
The one of you partying in that
bar in Boystown last night.

20:55.036 --> 20:56.994
Oh, yeah,
your alibi checked out.

21:04.350 --> 21:07.266
I guess you got
a decision to make.

21:09.224 --> 21:12.793
Hey, back to holding.
- Yeah.

21:12.836 --> 21:15.317
- Voight.
Sir.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.103
Sir, I don't think
that's a good idea.

21:19.147 --> 21:21.889
It's just gonna slow us down.

21:23.717 --> 21:25.936
Okay, then.

21:27.024 --> 21:30.332
Understood.

21:30.376 --> 21:33.117
All right, we got any news?

21:33.161 --> 21:35.119
- Yeah, patrol found
the getaway car,

21:35.163 --> 21:37.948
the Pontiac Aztec that was
used in the park shooting.

21:37.992 --> 21:40.603
It was burned to a crisp,
but they were able to

21:40.647 --> 21:43.302
lift prints off the flare cap
that was used to torch it.

21:43.345 --> 21:45.304
- Yeah, the prints
belong to this guy.

21:45.347 --> 21:48.002
Sean Alter, 26.
And it's his car.

21:48.045 --> 21:49.873
We confirmed it with the VIN
from the engine block.

21:49.917 --> 21:52.876
I mean, bottom line--
dude torched his own car.

21:52.920 --> 21:54.356
Here's his rap sheet.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.446
He's a small-time dirtbag
from Cicero.

21:57.490 --> 21:59.318
- It's clear on the other side
of town from the park.

21:59.361 --> 22:01.842
- Yeah, so now we just have to
figure out if Alter not only

22:01.885 --> 22:04.540
torched his own car, but also
shot Willa and Brooks Campbell.

22:04.584 --> 22:06.325
- All right, so let's pay
him a visit.

22:06.368 --> 22:08.283
If he's home, talk to him.
If he's not,

22:08.327 --> 22:09.850
we do a sneak-and-peek
off the books.

22:09.893 --> 22:12.983
We were never there.
Unless we find something.

22:13.027 --> 22:15.290
Then we'll do
some creative writing.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.640
Oh, yeah, I got one more thing.

22:17.684 --> 22:20.426
Just got off the phone
with the Chief of Detectives.

22:20.469 --> 22:22.906
He wants us to play nice
with Homicide on this one.

22:22.950 --> 22:24.560
Means that little sweetheart
from the park--

22:24.604 --> 22:27.476
What's his name?
Staples.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.260
He's gonna be joining us.

22:29.304 --> 22:31.741
- You're kidding.
- It's what it is.

22:31.785 --> 22:33.395
- So, what, we gotta
get him up to speed

22:33.439 --> 22:34.570
before we can track down Alter?

22:34.614 --> 22:36.833
- Hell no, no,
you guys do your thing.

22:36.877 --> 22:39.009
I'm gonna send him over to
Dolton Park, have him canvass.

22:42.448 --> 22:45.407
- No one's around.
Go for it.

22:54.068 --> 22:56.766
- We're gonna discuss how easy
that was for you later.

23:07.734 --> 23:09.866
- Clear.

23:19.049 --> 23:21.138
- Jeez...

23:21.182 --> 23:22.705
- Gun!

23:22.749 --> 23:24.925
A knife, Kev?
- Mm-hmm.

23:33.107 --> 23:35.544
- An 11-millimeter.
Don't see many of those.

23:35.588 --> 23:38.025
- Same caliber weapon that
killed Willa and Brooks.

23:38.068 --> 23:39.853
Hopefully, Ballistics can
make a match.

23:39.896 --> 23:42.029
- How the hell does a tweaker
from the white suburbs

23:42.072 --> 23:43.465
get involved
with a black gang war

23:43.509 --> 23:45.424
on the other side of town?

23:45.467 --> 23:48.644
- Something to think about.
- Yeah.

23:49.950 --> 23:52.909
- Just talked to IDOC.
Turns out our boy Sean Alter

23:52.953 --> 23:55.390
was roommates with
Lamar Garrison.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.696
- Started off
in different worlds,

23:56.739 --> 23:58.741
ended up in
the same 9x12 prison cell.

23:58.785 --> 24:00.526
- When they were locked up,
they were business partners--

24:00.569 --> 24:02.005
ran this underground
tattoo thing.

24:02.049 --> 24:04.007
But the guy we talked to
said they were like brothers.

24:04.051 --> 24:05.748
- And check this out.

24:05.792 --> 24:07.663
Three hours after the shooting,
Lamar Garrison wired

24:07.707 --> 24:10.361
three grand to Sean Alter.
- Well, it's an inside job.

24:10.405 --> 24:12.451
- Mm-hmm.
- Garrison hired Alter

24:12.494 --> 24:14.888
to kill his boss.
- And I can tell you why.

24:14.931 --> 24:18.065
- I think some of you have met
Paul Staples from Homicide.

24:18.108 --> 24:21.416
He elected to come on up.
- He's part of the team.

24:21.460 --> 24:22.852
All right,
show us what you got, Paul.

24:22.896 --> 24:24.680
- I went and shook
the bushes like you asked.

24:24.724 --> 24:28.684
No one's talking.
So I went to wholesale.

24:28.728 --> 24:31.861
Got a, uh, CI in distro.

24:31.905 --> 24:34.690
Lamar Garrison's been making
some really big moves.

24:34.734 --> 24:37.258
He had the feelers out,
he was trying to expand into

24:37.301 --> 24:39.826
fentanyl, carfentanil--
- I'm gonna cut you off.

24:39.869 --> 24:41.697
Break down how that
connects to Brooks.

24:41.741 --> 24:44.178
- Garrison was doing
it all on the sly.

24:44.221 --> 24:46.049
Brooks didn't know about it.

24:46.093 --> 24:48.356
Garrison told my guys
Brooks couldn't know about it.

24:48.399 --> 24:49.879
- Huh.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.838
- Garrison was moving
the corporation in a way that

24:51.881 --> 24:53.404
Brooks did not want to go.

24:53.448 --> 24:55.058
That's only gonna end one way.

24:55.102 --> 24:56.320
One winner, one loser.

24:56.364 --> 24:57.539
- Explains why Garrison went

24:57.583 --> 24:58.888
through so many hoops
to get it done.

24:58.932 --> 25:01.108
It was a power play.
And at the end of it,

25:01.151 --> 25:03.153
he needed the loyalty
of his troops.

25:03.197 --> 25:04.241
He had to use an outsider.

25:04.285 --> 25:05.982
- Well, our best move

25:06.026 --> 25:08.768
is to find Alter and get
him to flip on Garrison.

25:08.811 --> 25:10.378
- Sarge, we think we got him.
- Hmm.

25:10.421 --> 25:12.249
- Pings put him in Lawndale.
His family owned a bar there,

25:12.293 --> 25:14.251
closed down three years ago.
- Alter and Garrison had been

25:14.295 --> 25:16.427
in constant contact since
before the shooting.

25:16.471 --> 25:18.560
Alter's been staying at
this bar the last couple days,

25:18.604 --> 25:20.170
and the most recent ping
is two hours ago.

25:20.214 --> 25:22.564
- All right, so let's
hit this place.

25:41.931 --> 25:44.412
- Let's go.

25:44.455 --> 25:46.066
Clear.

25:53.073 --> 25:56.250
- Hey, hey!
Drop the knife.

25:56.293 --> 25:57.817
Drop it!

26:00.559 --> 26:03.605
- Hey, hey, no, hey!
I--

26:03.649 --> 26:04.824
- Bro, next one I won't miss.

26:04.867 --> 26:06.129
I'll hit you square
in the chest.

26:06.173 --> 26:08.044
Now put it down.

26:08.088 --> 26:09.655
- C-Cop--
Cops.

26:09.698 --> 26:11.918
- Sarge, I'm going in.
- I didn't know you guys--

26:11.961 --> 26:13.659
- Don't move!
- I didn't know you were cops.

26:13.702 --> 26:14.747
I swear.
- Against the bar.

26:14.790 --> 26:16.966
Damn right we're cops.

26:17.010 --> 26:19.621
Jay, we all good back here.
- Body.

26:19.665 --> 26:22.842
Sarge, it's Alter.

26:38.205 --> 26:39.989
- I'm surprised
you didn't put a bullet

26:40.033 --> 26:42.296
in that tweaker's head.

26:42.339 --> 26:45.560
- Eh, there's no need to.
- Need to?

26:47.562 --> 26:51.610
- Sarge, uh, tweaker's name
is Tony Krebs.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.437
Says he's Alter's cousin.
- Uh-huh.

26:53.481 --> 26:54.743
- Found the body
and was worried

26:54.787 --> 26:56.266
whoever killed Alter
was coming for him too.

26:56.310 --> 26:57.659
- So what was the kid
doing here?

26:57.703 --> 26:59.356
- Alter called him earlier
this morning,

26:59.400 --> 27:00.531
said he came into some cash.

27:00.575 --> 27:01.924
- Yeah, let me guess.
Three grand.

27:01.968 --> 27:03.578
- Yeah, you got it.
Alter called, said they were

27:03.622 --> 27:05.536
going to party,
score a bunch of crystal.

27:05.580 --> 27:07.321
- Huh.
- You believe this guy?

27:07.364 --> 27:08.496
- We do.

27:08.539 --> 27:10.150
Ran his hands,
no gunshot residue.

27:10.193 --> 27:11.499
I think he's telling the truth.

27:11.542 --> 27:13.066
- All right,
so hold him for 48.

27:13.109 --> 27:15.677
I mean, if he's got nothing
outstanding, send him home.

27:15.721 --> 27:17.113
- What the hell are
you talking about?

27:17.157 --> 27:18.854
This guy pulled a knife
on you, Voight.

27:18.898 --> 27:21.596
- Send him home.

27:21.640 --> 27:23.076
- Sarge?
- Uh-huh.

27:23.119 --> 27:24.599
- He's got muzzle burn
on his eyebrows,

27:24.643 --> 27:25.731
no GSR on his hands,

27:25.774 --> 27:27.515
no signs of defensive
wounds anywhere.

27:27.558 --> 27:29.996
He lies right where he was hit.

27:30.039 --> 27:31.562
So it looks like
he knew his killer.

27:31.606 --> 27:33.434
- Yeah, he did.
It was his old cellmate.

27:33.477 --> 27:35.349
We know the whole damn story.

27:35.392 --> 27:37.830
Problem is, we still got
nothing on Lamar Garrison.

27:37.873 --> 27:40.746
- He's sitting on the Rollin'
Avers throne as we speak.

27:40.789 --> 27:45.185
- All right, so we go talk to
Frank Rochester one more time.

27:46.708 --> 27:48.275
- I don't know
about this place, Sarge.

27:48.318 --> 27:50.146
You sure Rochester
is our guy?

27:50.190 --> 27:52.105
I don't think he's still got
the game that you think he has.

27:52.148 --> 27:53.846
- Yeah, how's that?

27:53.889 --> 27:56.065
- He's an old hand
that talks at the young guns

27:56.109 --> 27:57.327
and I'm not sure
if they listen.

27:57.371 --> 28:00.330
- Frank Rochester was
a big man 20 years ago.

28:00.374 --> 28:02.463
Everybody on the street
knew his name--

28:02.506 --> 28:04.247
some 'cause they loved him,
some 'cause they feared him.

28:04.291 --> 28:07.294
But they damn sure
knew his name.

28:07.337 --> 28:09.165
I'm pretty sure old Frank
can find the strength

28:09.209 --> 28:10.732
to front us for one drug buy.

28:10.776 --> 28:13.387
- And all I'm saying is,
that legend fades

28:13.430 --> 28:14.475
and there's nothing left
but ego,

28:14.518 --> 28:16.999
things can get dangerous.

28:17.043 --> 28:18.000
- You got a better plan?

28:20.960 --> 28:22.744
We go with Rochester.

28:25.007 --> 28:27.270
- Copy that.

28:27.314 --> 28:28.707
- So y'all come to make
that donation

28:28.750 --> 28:30.709
to the church, huh?
- We're not there yet, Frank.

28:30.752 --> 28:33.450
- What?
We had a deal, Hank.

28:33.494 --> 28:35.496
I help you out,
provide you with a service,

28:35.539 --> 28:37.933
and you make a contribution
to this house of worship.

28:37.977 --> 28:41.110
Now, I handed you JoJo McGinnis
on a silver platter.

28:41.154 --> 28:43.634
- That's the problem.
JoJo didn't do it.

28:43.678 --> 28:45.071
- So who did?

28:45.114 --> 28:48.335
- Lamar Garrison.
- What?

28:48.378 --> 28:50.119
- Lamar Garrison paid
his prison buddy

28:50.163 --> 28:52.382
to assassinate
Brooks Campbell.

28:52.426 --> 28:53.688
Then he thanked his buddy

28:53.732 --> 28:56.822
by putting a bullet
in his face.

28:56.865 --> 28:58.693
- Treated that boy like my son.

28:58.737 --> 28:59.781
That little bitch.

28:59.825 --> 29:02.523
- And he disrespected you,
Frank--

29:02.566 --> 29:04.786
your reputation,
your accomplishments.

29:04.830 --> 29:07.049
He's got no honor.
You understand?

29:07.093 --> 29:09.530
This kid has no code.

29:11.140 --> 29:13.708
- So help us put him away.

29:13.752 --> 29:15.362
- What?

29:15.405 --> 29:17.756
Look, I-I wasn't even there.
I ain't got no information.

29:17.799 --> 29:20.062
- We need you to set up
a deal for some work.

29:20.106 --> 29:22.021
- Drug deal?

29:22.064 --> 29:23.283
Yeah, but he killed two people.

29:23.326 --> 29:24.458
- We know that much,

29:24.501 --> 29:25.633
but we also can't
prove that in court yet.

29:25.676 --> 29:27.156
- Frank...

29:27.200 --> 29:28.767
we put him away
on drug charges,

29:28.810 --> 29:31.117
not only does that
get him off the street,

29:31.160 --> 29:32.858
but it gives us probable cause.

29:32.901 --> 29:35.686
We can search his house;
we run his phones.

29:35.730 --> 29:37.079
And let me tell you something,
it'll make it

29:37.123 --> 29:39.168
a hell of a lot easier
to build that murder case.

29:41.605 --> 29:43.477
- So you want me to front
like I'm back in the game.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.871
- Frank, after everything
you did for him,

29:45.914 --> 29:48.830
for this neighborhood,
and he turned around

29:48.874 --> 29:50.876
and treated you like a punk.

29:53.443 --> 29:55.402
I know you're not
gonna stand for that.

30:10.896 --> 30:12.636
- Word on the street
is it's official.

30:12.680 --> 30:14.421
You're the new Brooks Campbell.

30:14.464 --> 30:16.423
No, man, I'm just another dude
on the crew, all right?

30:16.466 --> 30:18.947
There will never be
another Brooks Campbell.

30:18.991 --> 30:20.862
- Well, that false humility,
that's cute,

30:20.906 --> 30:23.517
but I ain't buying it,
not for a second.

30:23.560 --> 30:25.127
- So why'd you call me,
Frank, huh?

30:25.171 --> 30:28.043
Why am I here?
- Well, let's talk business.

30:28.087 --> 30:30.132
- Here we go.

30:30.176 --> 30:31.568
- Business?
- Yeah.

30:31.612 --> 30:33.788
I got a friend who needs
product--big product.

30:33.832 --> 30:36.225
- What you know
about product, Reverend?

30:36.269 --> 30:38.445
- Mexican Tan.
Bricks.

30:38.488 --> 30:40.621
Now, he's a solid dude;
he got a lot of cash.

30:40.664 --> 30:42.144
Lot of clients, you know.

30:42.188 --> 30:44.538
He lost his supplier,
so he need a new connect.

30:44.581 --> 30:46.366
- Didn't know you was
back in the game, man.

30:46.409 --> 30:47.846
- Game ain't got
no in and out, man.

30:47.889 --> 30:49.195
The game is survival.

30:49.238 --> 30:52.198
All right?
Now, uh--

30:52.241 --> 30:54.156
I do a couple of these a year,

30:54.200 --> 30:56.028
and I keep
my church doors open.

30:56.071 --> 30:58.334
So you do it for God.

30:58.378 --> 31:00.032
Right?
- Look here, man.

31:00.075 --> 31:02.948
I'm lucky if I have ten people
at my Sunday services.

31:02.991 --> 31:04.993
I got a roof that leaks,
I got windows busted...

31:05.037 --> 31:06.473
I'm just hanging on.

31:06.516 --> 31:08.605
All right, so my friend here,
he's gonna bust me off

31:08.649 --> 31:10.694
some of this
if it all goes well.

31:10.738 --> 31:11.913
Now, one transaction
like this,

31:11.957 --> 31:14.263
and I'm good till
the end of the year.

31:14.307 --> 31:15.917
- How many bricks
does your friend need?

31:15.961 --> 31:17.310
- Two for now.

31:17.353 --> 31:19.573
But he said he'd be back
for more if this is easy.

31:19.616 --> 31:23.577
Now, I told him you the man,
so it's gonna be easy.

31:23.620 --> 31:26.275
- Okay, I'll think about it.

31:26.319 --> 31:29.626
- Hey, one more thing now.

31:29.670 --> 31:32.412
Are you sure you saw
JoJo shoot them people?

31:32.455 --> 31:34.240
- Why's he bringing up
JoJo McGinnis?

31:34.283 --> 31:35.719
Just plant the seed
in the mud water

31:35.763 --> 31:38.592
and get the hell out of there.

31:38.635 --> 31:40.681
- What you saying, man?

31:40.724 --> 31:42.596
- Word is, JoJo got an alibi.

31:42.639 --> 31:44.467
Now, the cops
are coming around.

31:44.511 --> 31:46.643
They asking me
more questions.

31:48.819 --> 31:50.952
- Oh, Frank tripping.
You think he made Rojas?

31:50.996 --> 31:53.172
- I don't know.
You wanna pull the plug?

31:53.215 --> 31:55.304
- I don't know.
We're close.

31:56.827 --> 31:59.918
- What you looking at?
- Girl is thick, that's all.

32:01.006 --> 32:03.530
Look, I'm a preacher,
not a priest.

32:03.573 --> 32:05.662
- You know, you seem to be
paying a lot of attention

32:05.706 --> 32:07.795
to my boy over there.

32:07.838 --> 32:10.624
- I'm looking at the sky, bro.
Ain't no rule against that.

32:10.667 --> 32:12.887
Where you from?

32:12.931 --> 32:15.803
- Look now, man.
I ain't playing like that.

32:15.846 --> 32:18.153
Not in the mood--worked
a double shift last night.

32:20.025 --> 32:22.462
- Yeah, all right.

32:22.505 --> 32:24.899
- Mm-hmm.
Think we're good for now.

32:24.943 --> 32:26.640
Good job, Rojas.

32:26.683 --> 32:29.512
- All right, Frank,
I gotta bounce.

32:56.017 --> 32:58.759
- Hear anything?
- No, but he'll make.

32:58.802 --> 33:02.023
That which will be
has already been.

33:02.067 --> 33:05.722
- I'm not sure what that means,
but I appreciate your optimism.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.812
- Oh, Garrison bit.
4:00 p.m.

33:08.856 --> 33:10.249
He wants to do it in my church.

33:10.292 --> 33:13.121
See, I told you I still got it.
I told you.

33:13.165 --> 33:14.296
- Well, that's good to hear.

33:14.340 --> 33:15.994
- Now, I'm assuming
that donation

33:16.037 --> 33:17.604
will be much larger
when I pull this off?

33:17.647 --> 33:20.476
- And you assume correctly.
- All right.

33:20.520 --> 33:24.002
'Cause I need that money
for my church, for my boys.

33:24.045 --> 33:26.004
- I'll see you at 4:00.
- All right.

33:44.109 --> 33:46.676
- Rochester's here.
Here we go.

33:46.720 --> 33:49.505
- Copy.
I'm in position.

33:55.598 --> 33:58.558
- Garrison just pulled up.
- Copy.

34:09.177 --> 34:11.571
- He's making a move
for the trunk.

34:14.226 --> 34:16.228
He's grabbing a black bag.
It looks good.

34:16.271 --> 34:18.273
It's weighed and squared off.

34:18.317 --> 34:21.450
- Brought the whole family
to the picnic, huh?

34:21.494 --> 34:23.148
What's up, fellas?

34:23.191 --> 34:25.193
Hey.
- Hey.

34:26.847 --> 34:28.631
- Stay out here.
Keep an eye.

34:34.159 --> 34:36.944
- Your man is about
ten minutes late.

34:36.987 --> 34:38.685
- You know a drug dealer
that's punctual?

34:38.728 --> 34:41.209
Hell, if the dude was on time,
I'd be scared he'd be police.

34:41.253 --> 34:43.168
Fair point.

34:43.211 --> 34:45.257
- Well, you always been
good with words, man,

34:45.300 --> 34:46.562
even before
you saw your light.

34:46.606 --> 34:50.610
Guess you picked yourself
the best career.

34:52.394 --> 34:54.222
Let your speech be with grace,

34:54.266 --> 34:56.746
as though seasoned with salt.

34:56.790 --> 34:58.879
I see you ain't been following
the scriptures.

34:58.922 --> 35:00.750
- Not since I stopped
letting you thump

35:00.794 --> 35:02.012
that damn book over my head.

35:02.056 --> 35:03.579
- I'm ready for this
to be done.

35:03.623 --> 35:05.364
- It'll be done when we make
an arrest, and not before.

35:05.407 --> 35:07.105
- You guys think
I beefed on Voight

35:07.148 --> 35:08.671
because he big-footed me
on a case.

35:08.715 --> 35:10.151
If I was some dog cop,

35:10.195 --> 35:11.935
I would've disappeared.
I would've walked away.

35:11.979 --> 35:13.415
I'm fighting to work this.

35:13.459 --> 35:17.115
I lost a CI in that exact same
park couple years back.

35:17.158 --> 35:19.465
He was damn good too.

35:21.206 --> 35:24.513
Whoever killed him
is from this world right here.

35:24.557 --> 35:26.167
- Oh.

35:26.211 --> 35:27.603
- Whenever I get a chance to
work to work this neighborhood,

35:27.647 --> 35:30.171
I take it.
No one's taking that from me.

35:31.955 --> 35:33.653
- All right, here's Kev.

35:45.926 --> 35:47.754
- All right, he's going in.

36:02.899 --> 36:05.032
- Going in.

36:14.041 --> 36:17.218
- Hey.
- Preacher man, hey.

36:17.262 --> 36:18.480
You good?
- Good.

36:18.524 --> 36:19.786
- All right.

36:19.829 --> 36:22.571
- All right, that's the man.

36:22.615 --> 36:24.399
- Okay, now, I don't know
how you wanna do this.

36:24.443 --> 36:27.228
My man swears by you more
than black Jesus himself.

36:28.795 --> 36:30.362
- So if you wanna cut to the
chase, let's get it done.

36:30.405 --> 36:32.668
All right?
- I'm cool with that.

36:32.712 --> 36:34.235
- Okay, man,
shall we show and tell?

36:39.197 --> 36:42.112
Mm, sounds like
$100,000 to me.

36:42.156 --> 36:43.679
- Mm-hmm.
- What you got for me?

36:43.723 --> 36:46.421
- You wanna taste it?
- Do I need to taste it, Frank?

36:46.465 --> 36:49.076
- No.
- I trust Frank.

36:49.119 --> 36:51.252
That means I trust you.
- Okay.

36:51.296 --> 36:53.385
- Let me see what you got.
- All right, bro.

36:53.428 --> 36:55.691
I think we got this.
We good now, you can go.

36:57.389 --> 37:01.436
- You dismissing me?
- Yes, I am.

37:02.872 --> 37:04.483
- Yo, man, this is my church.

37:04.526 --> 37:07.312
You can't dismiss me
in my church.

37:08.965 --> 37:10.445
- I think we all good, Frank.

37:10.489 --> 37:11.620
You know I got you
on the back end.

37:11.664 --> 37:12.839
If he says that
you should leave,

37:12.882 --> 37:14.275
it might be best you do that.

37:14.319 --> 37:16.886
- Mm-hmm, you heard
what the man said, all right?

37:16.930 --> 37:19.759
So get your ass up out of here.

37:22.109 --> 37:24.285
Are you deaf, old man?

37:24.329 --> 37:26.331
- Hey, man,
you better watch your mouth.

37:26.374 --> 37:28.637
- Go save your little souls.
- What's going on, man?

37:28.681 --> 37:31.249
Sad ass preacher--

37:32.337 --> 37:33.947
- Hey.

37:33.990 --> 37:35.383
- What are we doing?

37:35.427 --> 37:36.515
- Hey!

37:38.299 --> 37:39.648
What's going on, man?

37:39.692 --> 37:42.042
- Deal's done, I'm going in.
- No, do not engage.

37:43.391 --> 37:45.088
- I got a CI in there
and a cop who's unarmed.

37:45.132 --> 37:46.786
Stand down.
- Come on, Staples.

37:46.829 --> 37:48.004
That's our guy in there.

37:48.048 --> 37:50.572
- Damn, why'd you make
me do that, man?

37:52.008 --> 37:54.924
- Bro, stand down!
Bro!

37:54.968 --> 37:57.318
- Do it!
Do it!

37:57.362 --> 37:58.537
You reach, you die!

37:58.580 --> 38:00.713
- Damn it, move in, go, go!

38:00.756 --> 38:03.585
- Let's go.

38:03.629 --> 38:05.326
- Get against the wall!
Get against the wall!

38:05.370 --> 38:07.415
Get on the wall!

38:07.459 --> 38:10.070
- Yo, let's get out of here.
- The hell is--

38:10.113 --> 38:12.420
- Cops?
You done called the cops?

38:12.464 --> 38:14.292
- You gonna do that to me?

38:14.335 --> 38:15.771
You turn on me like that,
old man?

38:15.815 --> 38:18.426
- You turned on me, brother.
You turned on all of us.

38:20.167 --> 38:21.995
- Hey!
It's a'ight, man.

38:22.038 --> 38:23.605
It's not that serious, okay?

38:32.745 --> 38:36.052
- Hey!
Chicago PD, hands up!

38:36.096 --> 38:37.619
On your knees!
On your knees!

38:37.663 --> 38:39.491
- Get on the ground!
- Get on your knees!

38:39.534 --> 38:41.319
- Hands!
- Let him go!

38:41.362 --> 38:42.537
- Keep those hands up
right there!

38:42.581 --> 38:43.756
- Hands!

38:43.799 --> 38:45.366
- Stay right there, don't move.
- Get up!

38:45.410 --> 38:46.715
- Get on your knees.
Hands where I can see you.

38:46.759 --> 38:48.456
- Get up!
- Get up, turn around!

38:48.500 --> 38:49.805
- Okay!
- Turn around!

38:49.849 --> 38:51.024
- Roll an ambo.

38:51.067 --> 38:53.069
It's okay; take it easy.
Somebody's coming.

38:53.113 --> 38:55.681
Somebody's coming.
We got somebody coming now.

38:55.724 --> 38:57.770
- Hands behind your back.
- Okay!

39:05.430 --> 39:07.823
- He's conscious,
but he's in bad shape.

39:07.867 --> 39:09.564
- Okay.
Hey.

39:09.608 --> 39:11.914
- Cause of death: male ego.

39:13.394 --> 39:15.614
- Did what you had to do.

39:15.657 --> 39:18.791
- Pride before the fall, yeah?

39:18.834 --> 39:20.009
- Just rest.

39:34.807 --> 39:37.462
- All right, thanks.

39:37.505 --> 39:38.767
Ballistics just confirmed.

39:38.811 --> 39:40.682
The gun we found in
Lamar Garrison's car

39:40.726 --> 39:42.380
is the gun
that killed Sean Alter.

39:42.423 --> 39:43.859
- That's the last piece.
- Yeah.

39:43.903 --> 39:45.687
- Hey, let's finish that
charging sheet and complaints.

39:45.731 --> 39:48.037
I'll get it over
to the State's Attorney.

39:48.081 --> 39:50.953
- I'll call Willa's parents,
tell them we got the guy.

39:50.997 --> 39:52.390
- We'll start at the park,
work through the case

39:52.433 --> 39:54.261
in chronological order.

39:54.304 --> 39:55.697
Start with Lamar Garrison.

39:55.741 --> 39:58.526
Got a solicitation
of first-degree murder--

39:58.570 --> 40:02.051
- Frank Rochester probably
won't see tomorrow, you know.

40:03.009 --> 40:05.577
Yeah, his skull's cracked open,
bleeding on the brain.

40:07.056 --> 40:09.842
All his ribs are broken.

40:14.063 --> 40:15.848
- Did it right, Voight.
Did it by the book.

40:17.415 --> 40:20.287
- Not my book.

40:20.330 --> 40:22.463
I told you I had
an unarmed officer and a CI

40:22.507 --> 40:23.508
inside that church.

40:23.551 --> 40:25.161
- We made the arrest.

40:25.205 --> 40:26.641
That's the only thing
that matters--

40:26.685 --> 40:28.295
- I gave you a direct order--
- I don't work for you--

40:57.498 --> 40:59.935
- Nice working
with you, Paul.
