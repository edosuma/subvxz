00:13.791 --> 00:15.925
- Ahem.
- You OK?

00:15.926 --> 00:18.261
- Yeah, fine.
- Are you sure? You don't

00:18.262 --> 00:20.430
- look OK.
- Supermarket sushi.

00:20.431 --> 00:23.867
For breakfast?
Your savage bender continues.

00:23.868 --> 00:26.436
Yeah, something like that.

00:26.437 --> 00:29.739
OK. What's up?

00:32.943 --> 00:34.944
I'm pregnant.

00:34.945 --> 00:37.647
My Go...

00:37.648 --> 00:40.717
You OK?

00:40.718 --> 00:42.952
I don't know.

00:42.953 --> 00:45.221
What are you gonna do?

00:45.222 --> 00:47.424
I'm gonna do...

00:47.425 --> 00:49.726
what needs to be done.

00:51.762 --> 00:53.763
Six weeks.

00:53.764 --> 00:56.866
Apparently, it's the size
of a pomegranate seed.

01:02.673 --> 01:04.808
You really don't look great.
Why don't you

01:04.809 --> 01:07.644
- take the rest of the day off?
- What about Medusa?

01:07.645 --> 01:10.313
- My shift's about to start.
- Don't worry about her.

01:10.314 --> 01:12.315
She can get someone to cover. Just...

01:12.316 --> 01:14.317
go home.

01:14.318 --> 01:16.319
Get some rest.

01:16.320 --> 01:19.489
Hey, Stevie...

01:19.490 --> 01:21.724
What would you do?

01:21.725 --> 01:23.760
If you were me.

01:29.767 --> 01:32.268
I would really like to help
you out with this, but...

01:35.773 --> 01:38.341
you gotta make this
decision yourself.

01:38.342 --> 01:42.045
Yeah.

01:55.326 --> 01:57.260
Hey. Morning, Noah.

01:57.261 --> 01:59.362
Lunch orders?

01:59.363 --> 02:02.198
- Those go to Sullivan.
- Funny. No. Can you pull

02:02.199 --> 02:05.001
these case files for me?
Occurrence numbers are there.

02:05.002 --> 02:08.371
456 - 03. 1003!

02:08.372 --> 02:10.607
Ha! Ha! Ha!
Throwback Thursday's usually

02:10.608 --> 02:13.042
on a Thursday.

02:13.043 --> 02:15.879
It's a thing young people say.

02:15.880 --> 02:18.248
Fraser, Nancy, Brown.

02:18.249 --> 02:20.350
Those are the red-haired girls
that were found murdered.

02:20.351 --> 02:22.385
- Yeah.
- Funny. Popular files.

02:22.386 --> 02:25.355
Detective Price took a look at
them at the overnight last week.

02:25.356 --> 02:27.891
- Kyle?
- Yeah. Hang tight.

02:27.892 --> 02:30.059
I'll be right back.

02:42.573 --> 02:46.509
Hall? What the hell?

02:50.080 --> 02:52.081
Hey. You guys seen Price?

02:52.082 --> 02:54.083
- He was punchin' out.
- It's 9AM.

02:54.084 --> 02:56.219
Yeah, he just finished the Myer case.

02:56.220 --> 02:58.922
72 hours straight. Amazing.

02:58.923 --> 03:01.925
Caught his guy at a DQ in
the middle of his hot eat.

03:01.926 --> 03:06.362
- Your man crush is showing.
- So is yours!

03:06.363 --> 03:08.731
What're you lookin' at?!
It's not a man crush.

03:08.732 --> 03:10.667
It's a bromance. All right?

03:14.238 --> 03:16.239
OK. Right.

03:16.240 --> 03:18.575
Yes, I'll be there.

03:18.576 --> 03:21.110
Cooper? You free

03:21.111 --> 03:23.379
- to assist on a case?
- I was actually just...

03:23.380 --> 03:25.782
- What?
- Yeah.

03:25.783 --> 03:27.717
- I'm good. Yeah.
- Good, because we have

03:27.718 --> 03:30.820
- got a doozy.
- You... and... me?

03:30.821 --> 03:32.922
- Is there an issue?
- No, ma'am.

03:32.923 --> 03:35.425
You get to
spend it alone with the boss.

03:35.426 --> 03:38.728
Come on!

03:46.637 --> 03:48.638
What do you remember about this case?

03:48.639 --> 03:51.608
Um... Captain Martin Reid,
convicted of killing

03:51.609 --> 03:54.777
- 3 homeless men 8 years ago?
- He took them

03:54.778 --> 03:56.779
to an isolated spot,
positioned them in front

03:56.780 --> 03:58.948
of the water, strangle them

03:58.949 --> 04:00.950
and leave the body behind.

04:02.653 --> 04:04.587
This one was found by a hiker,

04:04.588 --> 04:07.757
a woman on a jog,
and a child's birthday party.

04:07.758 --> 04:10.293
- Can you imagine?
- This was your case, wasn't it?

04:10.294 --> 04:12.195
Yeah. I was the lead investigator

04:12.196 --> 04:14.130
of Major Crimes Taskforce at the time.

04:14.131 --> 04:16.666
I know. You were kind of a
legend when I was coming up.

04:16.666 --> 04:19.668
That was a lifetime ago. Anyway...

04:19.670 --> 04:22.005
Last week, a homeless man's body

04:22.005 --> 04:24.007
was found at Cherry Beach.

04:24.008 --> 04:26.876
Craig Larson, 62 years old,

04:26.877 --> 04:29.612
hands and feet were bound, strangled.

04:29.613 --> 04:31.881
- Same MO as Reid.
- Who is currently serving

04:31.882 --> 04:34.651
three consecutive life
terms at Montclair.

04:34.652 --> 04:36.619
So you think it's a copycat?

04:36.620 --> 04:39.188
Well, the Reid murders
attracted a lot of media

04:39.189 --> 04:41.190
and that kind of notoriety
always draws out

04:41.191 --> 04:43.192
the attention seekers.
But what concerns me most

04:43.193 --> 04:45.028
is that when Reid gets
word of a copycat killing,

04:45.029 --> 04:46.863
he's gonna try to use this
to prove his innocence

04:46.864 --> 04:49.632
- in the original murders.
- And you wanna get ahead

04:49.633 --> 04:52.468
- of that.
- Diane Taylor, who took over

04:52.469 --> 04:54.637
from me at Major Crimes, wants
me to oversee an interview

04:54.638 --> 04:56.673
with Reid today. And who better
to help us catch a copycat...

04:56.674 --> 04:58.675
- Than the cat himself.
- Yeah.

04:58.676 --> 05:02.045
This is gonna be a big interview, Jac.

05:02.046 --> 05:04.047
You want me to do it?

05:04.048 --> 05:05.982
Is there some reason
why you shouldn't?

05:05.983 --> 05:07.984
Because I need you on your game.

05:07.985 --> 05:11.220
No. Of course.
Yeah, whatever I can do.

05:11.221 --> 05:13.156
Great.

05:13.157 --> 05:15.324
Um...

05:15.325 --> 05:17.393
"Ass Clown"?

05:17.394 --> 05:19.362
My ex-husband.

05:19.363 --> 05:21.664
Andrew. Yeah. I just need to know

05:21.665 --> 05:23.666
how many tickets Sam
should put you down for.

05:23.667 --> 05:27.336
What do you mean?

05:27.337 --> 05:30.339
Yeah, I see. Your new
girlfriend is more important

05:30.340 --> 05:32.675
than your daughter's
university stage debut.

05:32.676 --> 05:34.944
No! No way!

05:34.945 --> 05:37.046
You tell her this yourself! I'm...

05:39.049 --> 05:41.584
So, any questions so far?

05:41.585 --> 05:44.420
- One.
- Mhm?

05:44.421 --> 05:48.524
- Why me?
- The truth?

05:48.525 --> 05:50.693
Couldn't hurt.

05:50.694 --> 05:53.229
Because Reid likes
pretty, young things.

05:53.230 --> 05:55.298
Is that a problem?

05:55.299 --> 05:57.200
No.

06:14.918 --> 06:16.919
It's locked.

06:16.920 --> 06:19.021
Get in.

06:21.325 --> 06:23.626
What the hell are you doing here?

06:23.627 --> 06:26.295
I pinged your phone.
Your turn. Why'd you take out

06:26.296 --> 06:28.297
- my dad's files last week?
- When you say

06:28.298 --> 06:30.466
"your dad's files", you're
referring to the 3 redheads?

06:30.467 --> 06:32.935
- Why are you looking into them?
- The same reason

06:32.936 --> 06:34.937
- you are, I guess.
- Brooke Dodson?

06:34.938 --> 06:36.806
I saw a connection, so...

06:36.807 --> 06:40.576
I took a trip down memory lane.

06:40.577 --> 06:42.845
There he is.

06:46.450 --> 06:48.551
Alvin Flowers.

06:51.288 --> 06:53.289
My God.

06:53.290 --> 06:55.591
I thought he was in Calgary.

06:55.592 --> 06:58.528
He was. I had a guy keeping
tabs on him there.

06:58.529 --> 07:01.464
- How long has he been back?
- A few weeks.

07:01.465 --> 07:04.100
Long enough to grab Brooke Dodson.

07:04.101 --> 07:07.170
Has anyone looked into him yet?

07:07.171 --> 07:09.539
Major Crimes paid him a visit but
they haven't found anything.

07:09.540 --> 07:11.340
That doesn't mean that
there's nothing to find.

07:11.341 --> 07:14.811
I know. That's why I'm here.

07:14.812 --> 07:17.513
Yeah, don't let the face fool you.

07:17.514 --> 07:20.716
Reid's a control freak. He's a
psychopath and a narcissist.

07:20.717 --> 07:23.085
I'm surprised I never dated him.

07:23.086 --> 07:26.289
Well, he's charming as
hell and a genius IQ.

07:26.290 --> 07:28.291
Are you talking about me again?

07:28.292 --> 07:30.860
- Diane!
- Hey!

07:30.861 --> 07:33.796
Come on! You gotta give me a hug!

07:33.797 --> 07:35.798
Still not a hugger!

07:35.799 --> 07:38.301
Same old Fiona. You know,
this is place is a maze.

07:38.302 --> 07:41.370
I was on another floor for like,
20 minutes before I realized it.

07:41.371 --> 07:43.372
A lot of hot guys in the
Fraud Squad, mind you.

07:43.373 --> 07:45.474
Well, great shoes,
no sense of direction,

07:45.475 --> 07:48.144
- same old Diane.
- And you are the same old...

07:48.145 --> 07:50.513
- Cooper. Jacqueline Cooper.
- Wow.

07:50.514 --> 07:53.482
- She is perfect. Just like you.
- Well, 150 years ago.

07:53.483 --> 07:56.219
Come on. You still
look good... ish.

07:56.220 --> 07:58.354
All right. Let's look at
some pictures of our body.

07:58.355 --> 08:01.490
His name's Craig Larson.
Diagnosed schizophrenic.

08:01.491 --> 08:04.493
Took to the streets a year ago. He has
three grown kids. They're devastated.

08:04.494 --> 08:07.997
They'd lost track of him. Found him
last Thursday at Cherry Beach,

08:07.998 --> 08:10.399
- bound and strangled.
- What're his hands tied with?

08:10.400 --> 08:12.401
- Cable wire.
- So he would've had

08:12.402 --> 08:15.838
to tie a knot for the binding.
Reid only ever used zip ties.

08:15.839 --> 08:18.007
But that little tidbit was
never released to the public.

08:18.008 --> 08:20.009
So our copycat wouldn't know that.

08:20.010 --> 08:23.012
Everything else checks out.
Homeless victim, strangled

08:23.013 --> 08:25.248
to death, hands were bound,
body was posed perfectly

08:25.249 --> 08:27.250
at a gorgeous waterfront scene.

08:27.251 --> 08:29.752
Whoever did this
definitely studied Reid.

08:29.753 --> 08:32.755
No DNA? Fibres? Anything to go on?

08:32.756 --> 08:35.224
We should be so lucky.

08:37.227 --> 08:39.761
- Shuttle's here.
- I need a coffee first.

08:39.763 --> 08:41.764
I have to make a quick call.
Why don't you show her

08:41.765 --> 08:44.133
where the coffee is and take her
down to the shuttle? Otherwise,

08:44.134 --> 08:46.569
- she'll end up in Cleveland.
- Ha! That's hilarious.

08:46.570 --> 08:48.905
Follow me.

08:48.906 --> 08:50.907
So, Fiona's new protégé.

08:50.908 --> 08:54.543
Has she given you the pep talk
yet? How does it go again?

08:54.544 --> 08:57.446
"Be better than everybody
else and don't embarrass me."

08:57.447 --> 09:00.683
I wouldn't say I'm her protégé.

09:00.684 --> 09:03.052
Come on now.
You're just being modest.

09:03.053 --> 09:06.222
Fiona doesn't pick just anybody
to work with her, especially

09:06.223 --> 09:09.058
on a case as important as this.
I would know. She was my mentor.

09:09.059 --> 09:11.627
Look, when you interview Reid,

09:11.628 --> 09:13.596
I'm gonna need you

09:13.597 --> 09:15.932
to explore every avenue.

09:15.933 --> 09:18.434
- Sure.
- I mean, we're almost

09:18.435 --> 09:20.303
definitely looking at a
copycat scenario here,

09:20.304 --> 09:22.538
but I'm gonna also need you

09:22.539 --> 09:24.807
to remain open

09:24.808 --> 09:26.842
to every possibility.

09:26.843 --> 09:28.778
Meaning what, exactly?

09:28.779 --> 09:30.680
Look.

09:30.681 --> 09:32.782
The Reid case was Fiona's

09:32.783 --> 09:36.085
swan song at Major Crimes.
It was her legacy, and a damn

09:36.086 --> 09:38.654
impressive one at that,
that she's gonna wanna protect.

09:38.655 --> 09:41.324
Copycat won't affect that.
Reid's behind bars.

09:41.325 --> 09:44.093
- That won't change.
- Unless we put the wrong man

09:44.094 --> 09:46.662
- away eight years ago.
- You're implying there's

09:46.663 --> 09:48.564
- a chance Reid's innocent?
- He's always maintained

09:48.565 --> 09:50.566
that he was framed.
This new murder gives weight

09:50.567 --> 09:53.536
to that theory. I've already been fielding
calls from the Innocence Project.

09:53.537 --> 09:55.571
- It could get messy.
- Fiona was worried about that.

09:55.572 --> 09:58.074
But... you know as well as I do,

09:58.075 --> 10:01.510
I mean, reopening another
cop's case violates a code.

10:01.511 --> 10:03.512
Yeah, I know what it means,
believe me. I'm just...

10:03.513 --> 10:06.349
I'm just saying
whichever way that goes

10:06.350 --> 10:08.351
that it's good that
you're gonna be here

10:08.352 --> 10:10.586
to help cushion the possible
blow that could be to Fiona.

10:10.587 --> 10:13.289
That's all.
'Cause you're close, right?

10:13.290 --> 10:15.291
No!

10:15.292 --> 10:17.360
I'm still on trial here.

10:17.361 --> 10:19.362
I've already got a couple
strikes against me.

10:19.363 --> 10:21.330
Reid's been transferred
from solitary.

10:21.331 --> 10:23.866
You should head over. You ready?

10:35.151 --> 10:37.252
- They're bringing him down.
- Yeah, OK.

10:37.253 --> 10:40.255
Um, do you mind if I...
I just need the bathroom.

10:40.256 --> 10:42.791
Yeah.

10:48.331 --> 10:50.432
- Cooper?
- Yeah, one sec.

10:54.337 --> 10:56.271
You OK?

10:56.272 --> 10:58.573
Yeah.

10:58.574 --> 11:02.110
- Never better.
- Great.

11:34.610 --> 11:36.912
Is she nervous? She looks nervous.

11:36.913 --> 11:39.714
Why would she be nervous? When
I was fresh, I loved the box.

11:39.715 --> 11:41.616
Didn't stop you from hurling

11:41.617 --> 11:45.053
before every interview either.

11:47.623 --> 11:49.791
Mr. Reid, I'm Detective Jac Cooper.

11:49.792 --> 11:52.694
It's a pleasure.

11:54.931 --> 11:56.932
Before we begin, I need

11:56.933 --> 11:58.934
to tell you this meeting
is being recorded.

11:58.935 --> 12:00.735
I know the drill, Detective.

12:00.736 --> 12:03.471
The only difference is
that the cameras are now

12:03.472 --> 12:06.341
moulded into the walls. I guess
a lot changes in eight years.

12:06.342 --> 12:09.844
They still add 15 pounds?
I should've hit the gym.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.651
You have great hair.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.653
I'm not here to talk about my hair.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.655
I'm here about Craig Larson.

12:20.656 --> 12:23.158
I'm sorry, it's just, um,
your hair. It...

12:23.159 --> 12:25.160
reminds me of someone.

12:25.161 --> 12:27.929
My wife, actually. She...

12:30.600 --> 12:33.268
has a similar...

12:33.269 --> 12:35.704
I'm not trying to waste your time

12:35.705 --> 12:38.106
but that is why they
sent you, isn't it?

12:38.107 --> 12:39.580
- I'm sorry?
- What better way to make

12:39.581 --> 12:42.611
a connection with somebody than
to bring in someone who looks

12:42.612 --> 12:45.814
just like the woman I lost.

12:45.815 --> 12:49.184
And it's the hair.

12:49.185 --> 12:51.786
I'm sorry. Forget it.

12:51.787 --> 12:55.223
Forget I said anything.

12:58.527 --> 13:00.896
Let's keep the focus on Craig Larson.

13:00.897 --> 13:03.131
Mhm. I don't know who that is.

13:03.132 --> 13:05.500
So, you're gonna have to
tell me what this is about

13:05.501 --> 13:07.502
and why I should care.

13:07.503 --> 13:09.504
Craig Larson was a homeless man

13:09.505 --> 13:11.339
who was killed the same way as the men

13:11.340 --> 13:13.441
you were convicted of murdering.

13:17.813 --> 13:20.415
His hands and feet were bound.

13:20.416 --> 13:23.818
He was on his knees,
facing the waterfront view.

13:26.756 --> 13:28.857
So that's what this is?

13:28.858 --> 13:30.859
You want me to help you

13:30.860 --> 13:32.894
find a killer because you think that

13:32.895 --> 13:35.530
they're killing in the
same style as me?

13:35.531 --> 13:38.033
Well...

13:38.034 --> 13:39.901
we're gonna have a problem there.

13:39.902 --> 13:42.570
- And what's that?
- I don't have his style.

13:42.571 --> 13:45.273
I... I'm innocent.

13:45.274 --> 13:47.442
This picture actually could probably

13:47.443 --> 13:49.444
help me a lot.

13:49.445 --> 13:51.513
Could I keep this for my lawyer?

13:51.514 --> 13:53.448
We think we're looking at a copycat.

13:53.449 --> 13:55.483
No, there is no copycat.

13:55.484 --> 13:57.585
It's the same person who framed me

13:57.586 --> 13:59.754
eight years ago, Alistair Wright.

13:59.755 --> 14:02.557
He is still out there somewhere.

14:02.558 --> 14:05.894
How many more men have to
die before you guys can

14:05.895 --> 14:08.463
finally admit you convicted
an innocent man?

14:08.464 --> 14:10.765
We didn't convict anyone. A jury did,

14:10.766 --> 14:12.767
based on evidence.

14:12.768 --> 14:15.770
Could you, um...

14:15.771 --> 14:19.207
The mess is a bit...

14:26.482 --> 14:28.716
And the pen.

14:31.053 --> 14:34.255
Much obliged.

14:34.256 --> 14:37.592
Your cooperation could go a long way

14:37.593 --> 14:39.627
with an appellate judge. I'm serving

14:39.628 --> 14:42.497
3 life sentences concurrently.
I'm not winning

14:42.498 --> 14:44.299
an appeal and we both know that.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.301
I need to be exonerated

14:46.302 --> 14:49.304
and you could help me if you
start going after the right guy.

14:49.305 --> 14:51.773
OK. You're innocent.

14:51.774 --> 14:54.809
I'll bite. Prove it.

14:54.810 --> 14:56.811
What's your story?

14:56.812 --> 14:58.646
The same story I've been telling

15:01.150 --> 15:03.084
that I was framed by a man.

15:03.085 --> 15:05.320
Alistair Wright.

15:05.321 --> 15:08.089
He was my commanding officer

15:08.090 --> 15:11.626
and he was my mentor and
he took advantage of that.

15:11.627 --> 15:13.639
I said it on the day
they picked me up and

15:13.640 --> 15:15.530
it'll be the truth
until the day I die.

15:15.531 --> 15:18.633
- I did not kill anyone.
- So why was your DNA

15:18.634 --> 15:22.103
- found at all three crime scenes?
- When you enlist,

15:22.104 --> 15:24.139
they take samples of your DNA

15:24.140 --> 15:26.541
if they need to identify
you and Alistair Wright

15:26.542 --> 15:28.777
had access to those samples.

15:28.778 --> 15:31.012
So you're saying you think he placed

15:31.013 --> 15:34.015
DNA of yours at all
of the murder scenes?

15:34.016 --> 15:35.950
No, I'm not saying I think it;
I know it,

15:35.951 --> 15:37.852
and he got away with it.

15:37.853 --> 15:39.821
Well, that's a theory,

15:39.822 --> 15:41.856
- not proof.
- He was a violent man.

15:41.857 --> 15:45.193
He killed before he even entered
the service. He told me this.

15:45.194 --> 15:47.662
- Again, hearsay.
- Two assault charges,

15:47.663 --> 15:50.665
both on record.

15:50.666 --> 15:53.201
You didn't know about that?

15:53.202 --> 15:55.303
Of course you didn't because
they didn't give you time

15:55.304 --> 15:57.272
to prepare for this but you know what?

15:57.273 --> 16:00.575
I've had nothing but time.

16:00.576 --> 16:03.144
If Alistair Wright was

16:03.145 --> 16:05.513
the original killer, he would
have killed Craig Larson

16:05.514 --> 16:07.515
the same way he did his other victims.

16:07.516 --> 16:09.384
Well, this looks pretty similar to me.

16:09.385 --> 16:11.486
Not exactly.

16:11.487 --> 16:14.089
See, whoever killed Craig Larson

16:14.090 --> 16:16.524
tied his hands with cable wire.

16:16.525 --> 16:18.526
The other victims, the ones you

16:18.527 --> 16:20.528
were convicted of murdering eight
years ago, had their hands

16:20.529 --> 16:22.330
bound with zip ties.

16:22.331 --> 16:24.165
The kind that just click into place.

16:24.166 --> 16:28.036
That is why we think it's a copycat.

16:28.037 --> 16:30.071
Well, wouldn't he
want to change it up?

16:30.072 --> 16:32.073
- What?
- I'm just saying,

16:32.074 --> 16:34.209
he put me away for his other murders.

16:34.210 --> 16:37.245
The MO is very close

16:37.246 --> 16:39.214
but the zip ties were not
released to the public.

16:39.215 --> 16:41.082
It's a detail a copycat

16:41.083 --> 16:42.917
could not have known.

16:42.918 --> 16:46.020
Thus, they did it wrong.

16:46.021 --> 16:48.456
What do you have to say about that?

16:52.027 --> 16:55.263
Do you have any idea what
kind of place this is?

16:55.264 --> 16:58.933
I was having a meal in
the lunchroom yesterday

16:58.934 --> 17:01.436
when I heard this loud...

17:01.437 --> 17:04.038
And I looked around

17:04.039 --> 17:06.040
to see what it was and I thought

17:06.040 --> 17:08.041
somebody had dropped their tray,

17:08.042 --> 17:10.645
but then I saw the blood.

17:10.646 --> 17:12.946
And I saw that the guy was
pickin' something up.

17:12.948 --> 17:15.517
And he was picking up his teeth.

17:15.518 --> 17:19.220
He was picking up his
teeth off the floor.

17:19.221 --> 17:21.455
And the guy who was
sitting next to him,

17:21.457 --> 17:23.391
he's still just sitting there

17:23.392 --> 17:25.260
and he's finishing his Jell-O.

17:25.261 --> 17:27.561
Mr. Reid, this is not
relevant to what...

17:27.563 --> 17:30.098
And when the guard asked him,
"Why did you

17:30.099 --> 17:33.535
slam that man's mouth into the table?"

17:33.536 --> 17:35.670
He said,

17:35.671 --> 17:39.274
"I didn't like the way he chewed."

17:39.275 --> 17:43.444
When I heard a detective was
coming here to talk to me,

17:43.445 --> 17:45.513
I actually had some hope.

17:47.249 --> 17:49.150
I was actually hoping that
someone was coming here

17:49.151 --> 17:51.819
to help me try to get back something

17:51.820 --> 17:54.622
that's kind of like
a... civilized life.

17:56.559 --> 17:59.193
But obviously,
that's not why you came.

18:03.666 --> 18:05.633
So, I think we're done here.

18:05.634 --> 18:08.102
No, wait.

18:08.103 --> 18:10.505
I'm not finished.
I have plenty more questions.

18:10.506 --> 18:13.174
My lawyer's gonna want
copies of that picture

18:13.175 --> 18:15.276
and he'll be in touch.

18:23.400 --> 18:24.620
What happened in there?

18:24.644 --> 18:25.967
You lost control.

18:25.968 --> 18:28.737
Yeah, I know. I was trying
to establish trust,

18:28.738 --> 18:30.772
thought if I could make
him comfortable...

18:30.773 --> 18:32.641
Yeah, you weren't supposed to
make him comfortable. You were

18:32.642 --> 18:35.444
supposed to get him to talk about
a copycat, not his innocence.

18:35.445 --> 18:37.612
Actually, that's not entirely true.

18:37.613 --> 18:41.116
I asked her to explore
every possibility,

18:41.117 --> 18:42.827
including the possibility
that we might not

18:42.828 --> 18:45.454
be dealing with a copycat.

18:45.455 --> 18:48.924
I see. And... when were you two

18:48.925 --> 18:50.926
going to inform me of that objective?

18:50.927 --> 18:53.128
We just need to keep an
open mind. That's all.

18:53.129 --> 18:55.163
I spent three years on that case.

18:55.164 --> 18:56.998
You've been here what, eight minutes?

18:56.999 --> 18:59.935
No one is questioning your
dedication or your police work.

18:59.936 --> 19:02.637
You got the person who fit
the crime at the time

19:02.638 --> 19:04.973
but now there's a complication.

19:04.974 --> 19:07.008
This new murder creates doubt.

19:07.009 --> 19:10.645
- Jac, feel free to jump in.
- Yeah, Jac. Jump in. I would

19:10.646 --> 19:13.348
- love to hear what you think.
- Well, I went in there

19:13.349 --> 19:16.485
expecting to have a
conversation with a psychopath.

19:16.486 --> 19:18.787
Psychopaths don't have
emotions. And talking to him,

19:18.788 --> 19:22.090
- looking him in the eye, I just...
- My God! You believed him!

19:22.091 --> 19:24.693
No, I didn't... not believe him.

19:24.694 --> 19:27.329
Jesus, Jac! He manipulates.
That's what he does!

19:27.330 --> 19:30.532
Maybe, but it doesn't matter
what I think right now anyway.

19:30.533 --> 19:32.601
What matters is what the public
will think if they get wind

19:32.602 --> 19:34.603
that Reid could be innocent.
Doesn't that mean we have

19:34.604 --> 19:36.605
to go through everything
with a fine-tooth comb?

19:36.606 --> 19:38.440
Yeah. I went over everything
with a fine-tooth comb

19:38.441 --> 19:40.275
eight years ago. Thanks for your help.

19:46.883 --> 19:49.518
So, are we going in or not?

19:49.519 --> 19:52.287
Because if we're not,

19:52.288 --> 19:54.289
then you need to tell me.
I need to go and pick up

19:54.290 --> 19:56.191
some air fresheners.
It's pretty rank in here.

19:56.192 --> 19:58.894
Kyle, come on.

20:01.798 --> 20:03.632
OK, fine. I'll go.

20:03.633 --> 20:05.467
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing?

20:05.468 --> 20:07.469
I'm doing what we're supposed
to be doing. I'm gonna go

20:07.470 --> 20:09.866
and get a reaction. If he's got
Brooke, I'll be able to tell.

20:09.867 --> 20:11.206
- Stevie...
- I just need to see his face.

20:11.207 --> 20:13.842
Stevie!

20:13.843 --> 20:17.179
St... Stevie!

20:17.180 --> 20:20.348
Damn it.

20:32.228 --> 20:34.863
Excuse me. Have you seen this girl?

20:34.864 --> 20:37.399
- No.
- You sure? Why don't you

20:37.400 --> 20:39.668
take another look? Maybe she
came into your shop sometime.

20:39.669 --> 20:41.670
You get a lot of high
school kids in here, right?

20:41.671 --> 20:44.139
- You're a cop, right?
- Does that matter?

20:44.140 --> 20:46.942
I should say that it does, because
if you are, I'm gonna have

20:46.943 --> 20:49.357
to get my lawyer to file
another restraining order.

20:49.358 --> 20:50.836
What are you talking about?

20:52.748 --> 20:54.916
Come on!

20:54.917 --> 20:57.252
You gotta be kidding me.
Is that Price out there too?

20:57.253 --> 21:00.222
You know, I'm trying to run a
business here and I don't appreciate

21:00.223 --> 21:03.325
- all the police harassment.
- I am not harassing you,

21:03.326 --> 21:07.262
Mr. Flowers. I'm asking
if you've seen this girl.

21:07.263 --> 21:09.431
She looks a lot like the ones
that went missing last time you

21:09.432 --> 21:11.266
- were in town, wouldn't you say?
- Now look, you need to go

21:11.267 --> 21:13.268
or I'm gonna have to
call in a complaint.

21:13.269 --> 21:15.570
And next time you show up,
bring a warrant.

21:15.571 --> 21:18.240
Hey, girls! Those are nice!

21:18.241 --> 21:19.841
Do you wanna try those on?

21:19.842 --> 21:21.843
Dressing rooms are just over here.

21:31.320 --> 21:33.188
- You all right?
- You were harassing him?

21:33.189 --> 21:35.156
No, no, no, no. That's
not what it sounds like.

21:35.157 --> 21:36.958
What? His lawyer filed
a restraining order!

21:36.959 --> 21:38.737
What does that mean? How
long were you on him for?

21:38.738 --> 21:39.961
A couple weeks.

21:39.962 --> 21:42.330
He recognized me from back in
the day and... it's nothin'.

21:42.331 --> 21:44.633
It's noth... you know
if he calls that in,

21:44.634 --> 21:46.635
then you've dragged me
into the mud with you?

21:46.636 --> 21:48.470
Please stop being
so dramatic, Stevie!

21:48.471 --> 21:50.972
You know what? You are
just full of the same crap

21:50.973 --> 21:52.974
- you always were!
- Hey, hey, hey!

21:52.975 --> 21:54.814
This case means something to me!

21:54.815 --> 21:56.829
It means something to me too!
I was on this case the first

21:56.830 --> 21:58.165
time around with your father.
Don't forget that!

21:58.166 --> 22:00.742
Yes! My father. I came here
because I wanted to finish

22:00.743 --> 22:02.309
- what he started.
- We started, Stevie,

22:02.310 --> 22:05.454
- what we started!
- What is this "we"?

22:05.455 --> 22:07.005
The night Nancy Brown went
missing, the same night

22:07.006 --> 22:09.558
you and I drove out to the
Bluffs. You remember that?

22:09.559 --> 22:11.560
Yeah, we...

22:11.561 --> 22:13.562
stayed until sunrise. So what?

22:13.563 --> 22:15.664
Your father asked me
to keep tabs on Alvin.

22:15.665 --> 22:18.767
I took a break, I went off with
you, Nancy Brown ended up dead.

22:18.768 --> 22:21.169
Jesus...

22:21.170 --> 22:23.171
We hadn't have done that,

22:23.172 --> 22:25.240
Alvin Flowers would be
in a cell right now,

22:25.241 --> 22:27.576
Nancy Brown would be a
30-year-old woman with a family.

22:27.577 --> 22:30.812
It's my fault that girl died.

22:48.647 --> 22:50.614
Hey! Yo!

22:50.615 --> 22:52.450
Pretty rough on Jac this morning.

22:52.451 --> 22:54.819
No rougher than I ever was
on you and look at you now.

22:54.820 --> 22:57.321
Currie! No one is questioning

22:57.322 --> 22:59.357
- the work you did!
- No?

22:59.358 --> 23:02.126
That's exactly what you
are doing. You requested

23:02.127 --> 23:03.961
my assistance to find a copycat

23:03.962 --> 23:06.597
but I will not help you
dismantle Reid's conviction.

23:06.598 --> 23:08.766
No! We're just being thorough.
We wanna make sure

23:08.767 --> 23:11.335
- we've got the right man.
- A DNA test says we do.

23:11.336 --> 23:14.004
And his name is Martin Reid.

23:16.208 --> 23:18.342
Go for Diane.

23:29.287 --> 23:31.455
Hello?

23:31.456 --> 23:33.357
Hey. It's me.

23:33.358 --> 23:35.393
I'm just, just checkin' in.

23:35.394 --> 23:37.695
You OK?

23:37.696 --> 23:39.797
Yeah, I'm... I'm fine.

23:39.798 --> 23:42.533
Look... I'm sorry about this morning.

23:42.534 --> 23:45.369
- I should've been more help. I was in...
- Shock.

23:45.370 --> 23:47.838
Yeah, that makes two of us.

23:47.839 --> 23:50.141
So... have you decided
what you're gonna do?

23:50.142 --> 23:52.343
No. Um...

23:52.344 --> 23:54.645
I haven't really thought about it.

23:54.646 --> 23:57.248
But when I do, I'll let you know.

23:57.249 --> 23:59.717
OK?

23:59.718 --> 24:01.652
OK.

24:19.838 --> 24:21.839
I thought you went home.

24:21.840 --> 24:24.341
I didn't.

24:24.342 --> 24:26.343
- Listen, I just...
- You know what?

24:26.344 --> 24:28.212
I don't really wanna talk right now.

24:28.213 --> 24:30.948
I just wanna watch the store.

24:39.758 --> 24:42.059
I want you to walk me
through every angle

24:42.060 --> 24:44.662
that you worked. Every detail.

24:47.399 --> 24:50.234
- Found another beach body.
- When?

24:50.235 --> 24:53.103
Civilian called it in 10
minutes ago. Victim's name's

24:53.104 --> 24:55.272
Reggie Kahn, homeless man
around Queen Street.

24:55.273 --> 24:57.575
OK, Cooper. Let's go!

25:17.896 --> 25:20.264
Ligature marks on the
neck where the victim

25:20.265 --> 25:22.666
was strangled from behind.
Hands are bound.

25:22.667 --> 25:25.302
- They used the ties this time.
- Died facing the water.

25:25.303 --> 25:27.605
Posed. He's fresh.

25:27.606 --> 25:30.508
Rigor mortis hasn't set in yet.

25:30.509 --> 25:33.143
- Cooper?
- Yeah.

25:33.144 --> 25:35.746
Let's see if the civilian

25:35.747 --> 25:38.015
who found him has been detained.
OK? And if not, get me the uni

25:38.016 --> 25:39.984
who took the statement. I want
all the information ASAP.

25:39.985 --> 25:43.120
- Yeah, right away.
- Don't say it.

25:43.121 --> 25:46.090
Just because they used zip
ties doesn't mean anything

25:46.091 --> 25:47.992
except the copycat got
it right this time.

25:47.993 --> 25:49.894
Got something right that's
never been released

25:49.895 --> 25:51.929
to the press? If that's luck,
then he should play the slots.

25:51.930 --> 25:54.565
- It proves nothing.
- It proves this is Reid's

25:54.566 --> 25:56.534
exact MO, down to a T.

25:56.535 --> 25:59.336
Craig Larson might've been a
fluke but this tips the scales.

25:59.337 --> 26:01.171
We need to broaden the investigation.

26:01.172 --> 26:03.007
Reid is guilty of those murders!

26:03.008 --> 26:05.609
- Why? Because you say so?
- Let's get one thing

26:05.610 --> 26:08.812
straight, Missy. This is about
a man with control fantasies

26:08.813 --> 26:12.249
who brutally murdered three homeless
men and is trying to get away with it.

26:12.250 --> 26:14.385
And what's worse,
he's going to get away

26:14.386 --> 26:16.620
with it using the help of
a detective I trained!

26:16.621 --> 26:20.224
You trained me to look at the
details and that's what I'm doing.

26:20.225 --> 26:22.059
The uniform who took the
witness statement's

26:22.060 --> 26:24.828
headed over. Press is
starting to arrive, so...

26:24.829 --> 26:26.830
I'll go talk to 'em.

26:26.831 --> 26:29.133
As of now,

26:29.134 --> 26:31.368
we're officially opening
up the investigation

26:31.369 --> 26:33.370
to include the possibility
that the Reid killings

26:33.371 --> 26:36.306
were mishandled by Major Crimes.

26:43.715 --> 26:46.050
Garbage.

26:46.051 --> 26:48.185
What is?

26:54.025 --> 26:56.327
I can still see the garbage from here.

26:56.328 --> 26:58.929
Yeah, so can I.

26:58.930 --> 27:00.998
OK, the ligature marks
are criss-crossed,

27:00.999 --> 27:02.866
meaning the killer had total
control over the body.

27:02.867 --> 27:05.035
He could use the ligature
like a steering wheel

27:05.036 --> 27:08.072
and angle the victim's head to
where he wanted him to look.

27:08.073 --> 27:10.407
- So what are you thinking?
- The person who murdered

27:10.408 --> 27:13.410
this man is not the person who
murdered those men eight years ago.

27:13.411 --> 27:15.245
You got that from a pile of garbage?

27:15.246 --> 27:17.081
The person who killed
those men eight years ago

27:17.082 --> 27:19.249
was a textbook organizational killer.

27:19.250 --> 27:21.385
Right? Methodical, meticulous,

27:21.386 --> 27:24.254
nothing out of place, ever.
Well, just like Reid.

27:24.255 --> 27:26.056
You saw what he was like
when you interviewed him.

27:26.057 --> 27:28.559
He's OCD, so the bindings
and the murder scenes...

27:28.560 --> 27:31.195
I mean, he values control

27:31.196 --> 27:34.398
over everything else,
so all of his crime scenes,

27:34.399 --> 27:37.201
every single one,
wasn't just about the isolation.

27:39.037 --> 27:41.038
It was about the beauty.

27:41.039 --> 27:43.107
So you're saying the
murder matches the MO

27:43.108 --> 27:45.075
but the site doesn't.

27:45.076 --> 27:47.211
Would a copycat make that mistake?

27:47.212 --> 27:49.546
He would try to mimic Reid's MO

27:49.547 --> 27:51.382
but how would you get
every detail right?

27:51.383 --> 27:54.418
You couldn't expect someone to get
all the nuances, not when they're

27:54.419 --> 27:57.054
so specific to the original
killer's psychology.

27:57.055 --> 27:59.657
The body sites,
those were all over the news.

27:59.658 --> 28:01.792
Yeah, so if they were gonna
screw up, it'd be over a detail

28:01.793 --> 28:04.261
like the zip ties, which is what
happened with Craig Larson.

28:04.262 --> 28:06.463
How'd they get it right this time?

28:06.464 --> 28:09.266
Well, who knew about the cable
tie mess-up other than us?

28:09.267 --> 28:11.568
Reid.

28:13.505 --> 28:15.806
The MO is very close,

28:15.807 --> 28:18.142
but the zip ties were not
released to the public.

28:18.143 --> 28:19.977
It's a detail a copycat

28:19.978 --> 28:22.413
could not have known.

28:22.414 --> 28:25.449
- Thus, they did it wrong.
- There! Look at Reid's face!

28:25.450 --> 28:28.452
- Just for a flash, but he's furious.
- Yeah, I could feel that.

28:28.453 --> 28:30.454
I just assumed it was because if
we could prove it was a copycat,

28:30.455 --> 28:32.289
it'd shoot holes in his
claim of innocence.

28:32.290 --> 28:34.291
No, I think it's because he took
the cable wire mistake personally.

28:34.292 --> 28:37.695
- What do you mean?
- He was in control

28:37.696 --> 28:39.763
of the interview until
that moment. Why?

28:39.764 --> 28:41.799
Maybe he thought I
was a weak opponent.

28:41.800 --> 28:45.169
- I thought that too, initially.
- Thanks.

28:45.170 --> 28:47.604
No, that cable wire mistake
caught him by surprise.

28:47.605 --> 28:49.840
That look of fury,

28:49.841 --> 28:52.609
that's the only moment of truth
in that entire interrogation.

28:52.610 --> 28:55.612
And then he covers it up fast
with that whole sob story

28:55.613 --> 28:57.448
- about the lunch room.
- You're right about that.

28:57.449 --> 28:59.516
That was a distraction.
The prison had no record

28:59.517 --> 29:02.152
of the incident at all.
But to come up with a story

29:02.153 --> 29:04.354
- like that on the spot?
- And sell it that convincingly?

29:04.355 --> 29:06.356
That's what he does.

29:06.357 --> 29:08.358
- He gets in your head.
- Mhm.

29:08.359 --> 29:10.360
So Reid was in on it.

29:10.361 --> 29:12.196
He knew what you were gonna
say about Craig Larson

29:12.197 --> 29:14.031
before you even walked in the room!

29:14.032 --> 29:16.333
So our copycat is actually

29:16.334 --> 29:18.802
a conspirator, and one who
screwed up on the zip ties.

29:18.803 --> 29:21.972
OK, but Fiona...
I double-checked the prisoner logs.

29:21.973 --> 29:23.814
He's had zero visitors
or calls in the past

29:23.815 --> 29:25.476
four months so if it
was a conspirator,

29:25.477 --> 29:27.344
how could he have ever told
him about the screw up?

29:27.345 --> 29:29.279
Jac...

29:31.015 --> 29:34.151
what if he was in
the room with you?

29:41.066 --> 29:43.338
Kenneth Hingston. CO
discharged from the

29:43.339 --> 29:45.099
service for beating a
civilian half to death.

29:45.100 --> 29:47.190
That didn't come up in his
pre-screening for the prison?

29:47.191 --> 29:48.860
Yeah, it would have but
his appeal overturned

29:48.861 --> 29:50.540
it and he walked away
a free and clean.

29:50.541 --> 29:52.683
Well let's hope he and Reid
don't have that in common.

29:52.684 --> 29:53.784
No kidding.

30:04.302 --> 30:06.731
- Kenneth Hingston?
- Yeah?

30:06.732 --> 30:08.699
Do you remember us?
I'm Detective Jac Cooper,

30:08.700 --> 30:10.668
Staff Inspector Currie.
We met at the prison.

30:10.669 --> 30:12.503
How you feeling, Kenneth?

30:12.504 --> 30:15.172
We heard you left work early
today. Were you sick?

30:15.173 --> 30:17.374
Don't worry. We won't tell
anyone you were playing hooky.

30:17.375 --> 30:20.845
But we would like to know what you
were up to between 11 and 2 today.

30:20.846 --> 30:23.647
- I was here, watching TV.
- No, you weren't.

30:23.648 --> 30:25.516
We spoke to your landlord.

30:25.517 --> 30:27.651
He said you didn't get in
'til around three today.

30:27.652 --> 30:28.646
What's this all about, anyway?

30:28.647 --> 30:30.488
We should probably discuss
it down at the division.

30:30.489 --> 30:31.640
You want me to go down to the station

30:31.641 --> 30:34.392
- 'cause I left work early?
- Let's talk about it there.

30:35.060 --> 30:38.662
- You kidding me?
- Humour us.

30:43.034 --> 30:45.035
So this is your conspirator?

30:45.036 --> 30:47.037
- Mhm.
- Why him?

30:47.038 --> 30:49.173
Well, he knew about the ties;

30:49.174 --> 30:51.175
He's got a military past.
He was Reid's CO

30:51.176 --> 30:53.177
since he arrived at Montclair.

30:53.178 --> 30:55.179
So, plenty of opportunity
to form a relationship.

30:55.180 --> 30:57.181
Sure, but can you prove
he killed for him?

30:57.182 --> 31:00.448
Well, if we can't, Reid's one
step closer to being exonerated,

31:00.449 --> 31:01.807
so I don't know what choice we've got.

31:01.808 --> 31:03.521
So you put the kid back in there?

31:03.522 --> 31:06.056
Everybody swings and misses sometimes.

31:06.057 --> 31:08.893
So, Kenneth, it says here
you were in the military.

31:08.894 --> 31:11.195
- For how long?
- Nine years.

31:13.465 --> 31:17.134
Look, I... really don't want
to do this. I don't feel good.

31:17.135 --> 31:19.103
Nine years.

31:19.104 --> 31:21.105
That's a long time.

31:21.106 --> 31:23.741
Thank you for your service.
I mean that.

31:23.742 --> 31:26.944
Is it true that after
all the hardship,

31:26.945 --> 31:28.946
you can never really go
back to normal life?

31:28.947 --> 31:30.948
What's that like?

31:30.949 --> 31:34.618
What do you think? It's hard.

31:40.959 --> 31:42.993
How long is this gonna take?

31:42.994 --> 31:46.630
Did you have any trouble
adjusting after you came back?

31:46.631 --> 31:48.699
What kind of question is that?

31:48.700 --> 31:50.424
One that you should
answer unless you want

31:50.425 --> 31:52.184
this to take a lot
longer than it has to.

31:54.206 --> 31:57.474
Fine. Yes, it was an adjustment.

31:57.475 --> 31:59.476
How so?

31:59.477 --> 32:01.478
I didn't sleep.

32:01.479 --> 32:04.148
I couldn't eat.
I found it hard to breathe.

32:04.149 --> 32:06.984
It was not a happy time, but...

32:06.985 --> 32:08.819
it happens to a lot of guys.

32:08.820 --> 32:11.589
So what changed?
I mean, how did things

32:11.590 --> 32:14.425
get better?
Assuming they are... better.

32:14.426 --> 32:16.427
The job.

32:16.428 --> 32:18.696
Being a CO is a lot like
being in the military.

32:18.697 --> 32:20.998
You follow rules.

32:20.999 --> 32:23.334
There's order.

32:23.335 --> 32:25.703
- Rank.
- Your employment file

32:25.704 --> 32:27.705
says you had some disciplinary issues:

32:27.706 --> 32:29.707
Attendance, punctuality,

32:29.708 --> 32:32.176
calling in sick.
It must have took a while

32:32.177 --> 32:34.612
before it made things better.
The job, I mean.

32:34.613 --> 32:37.314
Like you said, it was an adjustment.

32:37.315 --> 32:39.316
In fact, it wasn't until

32:39.317 --> 32:41.585
after you requested a
transfer to D Ward

32:41.586 --> 32:43.520
that things really turned
around for you, right?

32:43.521 --> 32:46.724
- Yeah, I guess.
- Tell me,

32:46.725 --> 32:49.360
why would someone want
to transfer to D Ward?

32:49.361 --> 32:51.328
'Cause I asked around and
that is a tough ward.

32:51.329 --> 32:53.964
Most requests are to leave it.

32:53.965 --> 32:56.500
- I like a challenge.
- Or...

32:56.501 --> 32:58.736
you liked Reid.

32:58.737 --> 33:01.672
Yeah, right. That guy's a freak.

33:01.673 --> 33:04.341
You spend a lot of time together.

33:04.342 --> 33:06.810
I'm a CO in his ward. There's
a lot of criminals in there.

33:06.811 --> 33:09.380
Right.

33:09.381 --> 33:12.349
But it must have been a bit
different for the two of you.

33:12.350 --> 33:14.285
You both served,

33:14.286 --> 33:16.220
you've seen the same things.

33:16.221 --> 33:18.088
Did you ever talk about the military?

33:19.925 --> 33:21.892
Once or twice.

33:21.893 --> 33:24.695
It must have been valuable,

33:24.696 --> 33:26.864
having someone to talk to.

33:26.865 --> 33:29.500
Did he talk with you a lot, Kenneth?

33:29.501 --> 33:32.336
A little, but we chose
different paths.

33:32.337 --> 33:34.538
He ended up behind bars,
I ended up in front of them.

33:34.539 --> 33:37.041
So, you're just two guys
who share an experience,

33:37.042 --> 33:39.043
maybe even an ethos.

33:39.044 --> 33:40.878
You end up in Montclair;
You in front of the bars,

33:40.879 --> 33:43.881
him behind them. But Reid...

33:43.882 --> 33:46.784
he doesn't make you feel like there's
any divide between you at all.

33:46.785 --> 33:49.853
- Are you asking me if he was friendly?
- Is that how you saw him?

33:49.854 --> 33:52.389
- As a friend?
- I didn't say that!

33:52.390 --> 33:54.558
No. No, but he does have
that effect on people.

33:54.559 --> 33:57.561
Believe me, I just talked
to the guy and I was ready

33:57.562 --> 33:59.763
to sign his release papers myself.

33:59.764 --> 34:01.999
But I'm a bit of a sucker too.

34:04.135 --> 34:07.671
He makes you feel like you
grew up right next door to him

34:07.672 --> 34:09.505
or something.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.375
The two of you, military guys,

34:11.376 --> 34:14.110
back in a rat's nest like Montclair,

34:14.112 --> 34:16.045
you're around a lot of bad people.

34:16.047 --> 34:18.114
Yeah, well, that's the job.

34:18.116 --> 34:20.717
How did Reid feel

34:20.719 --> 34:22.753
about his fellow prisoners?

34:25.090 --> 34:27.257
He thought they wasted their lives.

34:27.257 --> 34:29.726
Did that make him angry?

34:29.728 --> 34:31.728
He talks a lot about potential.

34:31.730 --> 34:33.897
Like they threw theirs away.

34:33.898 --> 34:36.132
But not you. You served.

34:36.134 --> 34:38.268
You did your public duty.

34:38.268 --> 34:40.304
Damn right.

34:40.304 --> 34:43.639
Did he ever talk about the murders?

34:43.641 --> 34:45.775
Just to say that
he didn't do 'em.

34:45.777 --> 34:49.480
These photos...

34:49.481 --> 34:53.217
from eight years ago, take a look.

34:54.985 --> 34:56.954
These are the men

34:56.955 --> 34:58.956
Reid claims he didn't kill.

34:58.957 --> 35:01.959
Now, look at Craig Larson.

35:01.960 --> 35:04.461
Notice a difference?

35:04.462 --> 35:06.830
- No.
- No?

35:06.831 --> 35:09.066
The hands?

35:09.067 --> 35:12.169
See, this victim's
hands are tied wrong.

35:12.170 --> 35:14.872
There are two types of killers,

35:14.873 --> 35:16.874
organized and disorganized.

35:16.875 --> 35:19.343
The person who killed these
men was organized, precise.

35:19.344 --> 35:22.212
They took their time. They knew
exactly what they were doing,

35:22.213 --> 35:24.148
but this killer?

35:24.149 --> 35:26.517
Messy. Amateur at best.

35:26.518 --> 35:29.153
They look the same to me.

35:29.154 --> 35:31.188
Well, that's because
you are an amateur,

35:31.189 --> 35:34.491
looking at crime scene
photos takes a trained eye.

35:34.492 --> 35:37.061
Now, look at this one.

35:37.062 --> 35:40.330
See, this time,
the killer got it right.

35:40.331 --> 35:42.799
The hands were tied with zip ties.

35:44.803 --> 35:47.304
But... you still got it wrong.

35:49.374 --> 35:52.209
I don't see what you mean.
It looks exactly like

35:52.210 --> 35:54.078
- the other ones.
- Nope.

35:54.079 --> 35:57.314
See the garbage?
Another sloppy mistake.

35:57.315 --> 36:00.384
Reid was a captain.
He needed a soldier.

36:00.385 --> 36:03.987
Thing is, he picked the
wrong one. He picked a dud.

36:03.988 --> 36:06.990
A disorganized, messy dud.

36:06.991 --> 36:09.726
Same reason you were removed
from service, right?

36:09.727 --> 36:10.658
No. No, that was overturned.

36:10.659 --> 36:12.729
Doesn't change the fact that
you badly injured a civilian.

36:12.730 --> 36:15.365
You prey on the weak,
like Reggie Kahn:

36:15.366 --> 36:18.402
A walking embodiment
of wasted potential.

36:18.403 --> 36:20.337
I told you, I went home!

36:20.338 --> 36:23.407
At three. You went home at
three. Where were you before?

36:23.408 --> 36:26.278
'Cause CCTV footage puts you
on Queen Street. Same place

36:26.279 --> 36:28.078
Reggie Kahn disappeared from.

36:28.079 --> 36:30.047
It'd be pretty easy for a
trained man to take him down.

36:30.048 --> 36:31.982
Now, how do you think Reid

36:31.983 --> 36:34.218
is gonna react to this mistake?

36:34.219 --> 36:36.353
'Cause we saw how you
reacted to the first one.

36:36.354 --> 36:38.555
- No. I didn't do anything.
- You wanna be there

36:38.556 --> 36:40.591
when we tell him? Maybe you
should tell him yourself.

36:40.592 --> 36:43.227
You were his soldier,

36:43.228 --> 36:46.096
his lieutenant, and you
failed your mission.

36:46.097 --> 36:48.065
Just like you fail at everything!

36:48.066 --> 36:51.535
I did what had to be done!

36:51.536 --> 36:54.972
They tell you to silence a civilian,
you silence that civilian!

36:54.973 --> 36:57.174
I followed my order!

36:57.175 --> 37:00.043
I did what I was told!

37:00.044 --> 37:02.045
Just like you followed your orders

37:02.046 --> 37:04.548
to kill Craig and Reggie.

37:06.484 --> 37:09.119
Isn't that right, soldier?

37:09.120 --> 37:11.788
- SOLDIER! Answer me!
- Yes, sir!

37:11.789 --> 37:15.025
Yes, sir! YES, SIR!

37:25.559 --> 37:28.294
Incredible connection you made.

37:28.295 --> 37:31.063
- She's a keeper.
- Yeah, so they keep telling me.

37:31.064 --> 37:32.965
Hingston's been transferred
to a cell. You should've seen

37:32.966 --> 37:34.800
the look on Reid's
face when we told him.

37:34.801 --> 37:37.270
Yeah? Wish you'd taken a
picture. I could've used

37:37.271 --> 37:39.472
- a new dart board.
- It was nice,

37:39.473 --> 37:41.741
working with you again.
We make a good team.

37:41.742 --> 37:44.710
- We always did.
- Keep in touch, OK?

37:46.446 --> 37:49.081
- It was great meeting you.
- You too, Cooper. Hey,

37:49.082 --> 37:51.250
if you ever want to join Major
Crimes, give me a call.

37:51.251 --> 37:54.120
Jesus! Could you at least
have the courtesy of poaching

37:54.121 --> 37:56.656
- my staff behind my back?
- You know me, I like to let it

37:56.657 --> 38:00.092
all hang out. You can
learn a lot from Fiona.

38:00.093 --> 38:02.995
I learned more working with her
than I ever did at the academy.

38:02.996 --> 38:05.598
Yeah. Well, you know, all they
teach you at that place is

38:05.599 --> 38:07.633
- how to put your gear on right.
- If you hadn't left

38:07.634 --> 38:10.136
the task force,
you'd still be running it.

38:10.137 --> 38:12.939
Yeah. You'd still be a pain in my ass.

38:12.940 --> 38:16.208
Am I the only one terrified
that woman is in charge

38:16.209 --> 38:18.044
- of public safety?
- Don't let her fool you.

38:18.045 --> 38:20.813
She's brilliant.
Colourful, but brilliant.

38:20.814 --> 38:23.482
Was it strange,
working with your old protégé?

38:23.483 --> 38:25.985
- Why would it be strange?
- Well, I don't know.

38:25.986 --> 38:27.853
It must have been pretty cool.

38:27.854 --> 38:29.789
Jet-setting across the country,

38:29.790 --> 38:32.158
cracking unsolvable cases.

38:32.159 --> 38:34.694
Yeah, it was.

38:34.695 --> 38:37.797
It must have been hard,
working with the woman

38:37.798 --> 38:40.099
who took your job.

38:40.100 --> 38:42.034
- Do you miss it?
- Every day.

38:42.035 --> 38:44.236
Get back to work.

38:56.984 --> 38:59.885
I always felt kind of
responsible for your father.

38:59.886 --> 39:03.489
- No. No, don't do that.
- What?

39:03.490 --> 39:05.391
- Do what?
- Make this about you.

39:05.392 --> 39:07.827
- It was my father that died.
- What are you gonna do, Stevie?

39:07.828 --> 39:10.329
Argue about who feels the guiltiest?

39:10.330 --> 39:12.531
I found my dad hanging in the
garage. I've had to live

39:12.532 --> 39:14.900
- with that for 15 years.
- I've had to live with the fact

39:14.901 --> 39:17.903
that I didn't do what he wanted me to do
and someone died because of it, which...

39:17.904 --> 39:21.374
"Which"?

39:21.375 --> 39:24.477
Nothing. You win.
Daughter's prerogative.

39:28.615 --> 39:31.183
You know, we should probably
go and see the cop shrink.

39:31.184 --> 39:34.186
Yeah.

39:34.187 --> 39:36.188
- But we won't.
- No.

39:36.189 --> 39:38.457
No.

39:43.196 --> 39:45.197
My dad had been coming
apart for a while.

39:47.134 --> 39:50.603
Me and my mom and Harry,
we all saw that.

39:50.604 --> 39:53.539
You only knew him for a short time.

39:53.540 --> 39:56.442
You saw him at his worst.

39:56.443 --> 39:58.477
But he'd always been this...

39:58.478 --> 40:01.280
this... giant presence.

40:03.150 --> 40:05.985
He wasn't just another
person in the room.

40:05.986 --> 40:08.954
He was the room.

40:08.955 --> 40:10.956
I'd like to have

40:10.957 --> 40:13.159
seen more of that.

40:13.160 --> 40:15.127
Yeah.

40:15.128 --> 40:17.096
Me too.

40:17.097 --> 40:19.131
Price! PRICE! Hey, buddy.

40:19.132 --> 40:22.201
I see that she found you after all.

40:22.202 --> 40:24.070
Sullivan, can't you see
these two wanna be alone?

40:24.071 --> 40:25.905
Why? Are you on a date or something?

40:25.906 --> 40:27.398
- Shut up.
- Ha ha ha!

40:27.399 --> 40:28.908
Sit down.

40:28.909 --> 40:32.111
Can I get a pint of stout, please?

40:32.112 --> 40:34.080
Sorry, what?

40:34.081 --> 40:36.649
Yeah. Excuse me, sweetheart,
can you make that another round

40:36.650 --> 40:39.351
for the table and put it
on Detective Finch's tab?

40:39.352 --> 40:42.154
Hey, when's it gonna be
on your tab, Sullivan?

40:42.155 --> 40:44.790
When my daddy
starts paying for it.

40:44.791 --> 40:46.125
Ooh...

40:46.126 --> 40:48.227
That hurt.

40:55.836 --> 40:58.137
- Two shots of whiskey.
- No. I'm OK.

40:58.138 --> 41:00.139
Who says one's for you?

41:00.140 --> 41:02.942
When were you planning on telling me?

41:02.943 --> 41:05.978
- What?
- How far along are you?

41:05.979 --> 41:08.781
Come on, Cooper. I'm a detective.

41:08.782 --> 41:10.950
So?

41:10.951 --> 41:13.319
Six weeks.

41:15.322 --> 41:17.389
Congratulations.

41:17.390 --> 41:19.992
Thanks. I'm not sure

41:19.993 --> 41:22.027
what my plans are.

41:22.028 --> 41:24.463
Well, you don't need to know
yet. But when you do...

41:24.464 --> 41:27.633
we'll be here for you.

41:27.634 --> 41:31.470
To a good day.
We kept a scumbag behind bars.

41:31.471 --> 41:33.706
Yeah, only because
you were relentless.

41:33.707 --> 41:36.308
Well, you'll have your own Reid
one day. Two more, please.

41:36.309 --> 41:38.377
Don't you have a play to get to?

41:38.378 --> 41:41.046
I do. This'll help. Trust me.

41:41.047 --> 41:44.183
Are you glad you had kids?

41:44.184 --> 41:47.686
Of course I am. It's wonderful.

41:47.687 --> 41:49.855
However, being connected
to their father

41:49.856 --> 41:51.891
for the rest of my life...

41:51.892 --> 41:54.660
- Can't divorce a co-parent.
- Can't kill him either.

41:54.661 --> 41:56.562
Still more work for me in the end.

41:56.563 --> 41:59.732
Hey, honey.
Thanks for getting back to me.

41:59.733 --> 42:02.334
Yeah, I just wanted to talk
to you about the play.

42:02.335 --> 42:05.037
You know, your father really tried

42:05.038 --> 42:07.406
but, um... he's not gonna

42:07.407 --> 42:09.241
be able to make it.

42:09.242 --> 42:12.211
I know.

42:12.212 --> 42:14.413
What do you mean?

42:14.414 --> 42:16.448
Of course I'm at work.

42:16.449 --> 42:17.549
Yes, I am.

42:20.905 --> 42:22.093
Hey.

42:22.512 --> 42:24.836
You want to talk about it?

42:25.310 --> 42:26.623
No.

42:27.971 --> 42:29.071
I'll get us a seat then.
