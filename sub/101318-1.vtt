00:38.121 --> 00:39.289
Hi, I'm Ivan.

00:40.081 --> 00:41.082
I'm a gorilla.

00:42.208 --> 00:43.668
It's not as easy as it looks.

00:44.544 --> 00:45.545
You'll see.

00:46.296 --> 00:50.133
Out this window
is the billboard for my show.

00:50.216 --> 00:53.511
I'm the headliner.
Which means I'm the star.

00:55.096 --> 00:57.057
I look pretty ferocious, don't I?

00:57.557 --> 01:00.727
I'm never really angry, but I can pretend.

01:00.810 --> 01:01.811
That's my job.

01:02.604 --> 01:07.192
For 20 years humans have come
from miles around to visit me

01:07.275 --> 01:10.904
at the Big Top Mall
and Video Arcade at exit eight.

01:10.987 --> 01:14.991
And this is our tent,
where we perform inside the mall.

01:15.075 --> 01:16.493
It's pretty unique?

01:16.576 --> 01:18.453
Welcome, one and all!

01:18.536 --> 01:19.746
Step right up!

01:19.829 --> 01:23.416
- Our show will commence in five minutes!
- Five.

01:23.500 --> 01:26.878
This is Mack. I've known him
for as long as I can remember.

01:26.961 --> 01:28.421
He's a little bit of a ham.

01:28.505 --> 01:30.757
I thank you all for coming! Hello there!

01:30.840 --> 01:33.301
I'm not sure the accent's foolin' anyone.

01:33.385 --> 01:37.263
Welcome to the littlest big top on Earth!

01:37.347 --> 01:41.476
Prepare yourselves for the most
marvelously majestic animal show,

01:41.559 --> 01:44.104
the likes of which you have never seen!

01:45.855 --> 01:48.733
Introducing Henrietta!

01:48.817 --> 01:52.612
The best baseball-playing chicken
you've ever seen.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.407
The batter is now approaching the plate.

01:55.490 --> 01:58.118
She's got incredible
beak-eye coordination.

01:59.911 --> 02:01.371
That's my girl!

02:01.454 --> 02:03.081
Home run!

02:03.164 --> 02:04.958
Frankie, the seal!

02:06.418 --> 02:09.254
I will not drop the ball.
I'm gonna drop the ball.

02:09.337 --> 02:11.339
He's a little, neurotic.

02:11.423 --> 02:12.882
I'm gonna drop the ball.

02:12.966 --> 02:15.719
But his act is always perfect.

02:15.802 --> 02:17.345
Well done!

02:17.429 --> 02:19.556
I didn't drop the ball!

02:19.639 --> 02:21.683
- Here he comes.
- Murphy!

02:21.766 --> 02:24.060
Rabbit in a fire truck!

02:25.353 --> 02:26.438
Whee!

02:26.521 --> 02:28.982
Murphy's always a big hit with the kids.

02:29.065 --> 02:34.237
Now, the queen of the Big Top, Stella!

02:35.613 --> 02:38.825
Stella is my oldest and wisest friend.

02:39.409 --> 02:42.287
She's been performing
since before I was born.

02:42.370 --> 02:44.831
She knows more than I'll ever know.

02:44.914 --> 02:47.459
Now, where's my favorite poodle gone?

02:48.126 --> 02:49.336
There's my cue.

02:50.253 --> 02:52.339
Snickers brings a lot of class
to the show.

02:52.422 --> 02:56.176
I love an audience.
Best part of the day.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.260
Up you go, girl!

02:57.344 --> 02:59.971
They nail their routine every time.

03:00.055 --> 03:03.725
- Come on, Snickers. Let's do this.
- Okay, Stella. Ready when you are.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.935
- Trunk up!
- There you go.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.812
Magic.

03:08.438 --> 03:10.482
- And this guy...
- Hey, pal.

03:10.565 --> 03:11.733
Is my best buddy.

03:11.816 --> 03:13.735
He's not supposed to be here, but he...

03:14.235 --> 03:16.071
He sure makes himself at home.

03:16.154 --> 03:19.783
Now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

03:19.866 --> 03:24.329
I don't do any tricks.
Mack says it's enough for me to be me.

03:24.412 --> 03:27.040
But I'm the headliner, so I come on last.

03:27.123 --> 03:28.625
You've heard of the legend...

03:28.708 --> 03:31.920
Sounds like a lot of pressure,
I know, but I love my job.

03:32.003 --> 03:33.755
See him for yourselves!

03:33.838 --> 03:35.298
Wait for it, wait for it...

03:35.382 --> 03:38.301
The one and only Ivan!

03:41.012 --> 03:42.555
Watch this.

03:42.639 --> 03:45.350
I always get the kids.

03:47.769 --> 03:49.604
And then a little chest thump.

03:51.272 --> 03:53.191
That's pretty impressive?

03:53.274 --> 03:59.906
The one and only Ivan!

04:01.241 --> 04:03.660
And this is Julia.

04:03.743 --> 04:07.914
She comes by my domain every night
because her father, George, works here.

04:07.997 --> 04:13.003
She could sit anywhere,
but she always chooses to sit by me.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.587
I think she likes me.

04:15.672 --> 04:18.591
- What do you think, Ivan?
- How about that?

04:18.675 --> 04:20.677
That's the real me right there.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.264
Hey, Jules, that's a good one.

04:24.347 --> 04:25.932
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

04:26.474 --> 04:28.727
George, your girl's got
some serious talent.

04:29.352 --> 04:31.813
She gets it from her mother.

04:32.564 --> 04:34.274
Yeah, how's Sarah doing?

04:35.191 --> 04:37.527
She has her good days and bad days.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.612
And these things, they take time.

04:40.447 --> 04:41.448
Yeah.

04:43.450 --> 04:44.451
Jules,

04:45.118 --> 04:48.830
why don't you go buy yourself
some new crayons?

04:49.998 --> 04:51.875
You don't need to do that, Mack.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.002
No, I... I'd like to.

04:56.046 --> 04:58.089
What do you say, Julia?

04:58.173 --> 05:00.133
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

05:02.552 --> 05:04.721
Go quick, all right? We gotta get going.

05:07.390 --> 05:10.560
School's out soon.
Things always pick up then.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.854
Yeah. It'll pick up.

05:12.937 --> 05:13.938
Yeah.

05:17.275 --> 05:18.693
This ain't good, kid.

05:20.153 --> 05:23.323
This won't even begin to cover
food and rent.

05:23.907 --> 05:27.786
We gotta pack 'em in again.
Get the excitement back, you know?

05:28.953 --> 05:31.831
If we don't, it's over.

05:33.958 --> 05:35.543
Then what are we gonna do?

05:41.383 --> 05:42.384
Great.

05:43.343 --> 05:45.053
Asking a gorilla for advice.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.606
"Get the excitement back"?

06:06.908 --> 06:11.538
Don't you just love the moon,
with its untroubled smile?

06:11.621 --> 06:13.456
I prefer the sun.

06:13.540 --> 06:15.667
I love the feel of sun on my belly.

06:15.750 --> 06:19.295
It is an impressive belly, my friend.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.007
- Thank you.
- Somebody loves sleeping on it.

06:22.090 --> 06:26.511
You know, the first night
he snuck in here he was half this size.

06:26.594 --> 06:29.848
He was adorable.
I dreamt I ate a furry doughnut.

06:33.101 --> 06:36.896
Stella, you remember when this place
was packed with people?

06:36.980 --> 06:40.025
Three shows a day. Standing room only.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.651
I remember.

06:41.735 --> 06:44.654
You think it's not like that anymore
because of me?

06:45.196 --> 06:47.240
Do you think I've lost my edge?

06:47.323 --> 06:50.452
I mean, if they want an angry gorilla,
I can still be that.

06:53.038 --> 06:55.457
Why do they want an angry gorilla anyway?

06:55.540 --> 06:57.834
I think humans like us one way.

06:57.917 --> 07:00.670
And gorillas they see as angry.

07:01.755 --> 07:05.050
My father used to say, "Anger is precious.

07:05.633 --> 07:08.762
Use it to keep order
and warn others of danger."

07:09.721 --> 07:12.349
But here, there's no one to protect.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.393
Sometimes it's hard to roar for no reason.

07:15.477 --> 07:16.478
I know.

07:16.561 --> 07:18.980
I didn't touch the kibble. It wasn't me.

07:19.064 --> 07:20.357
Hi.

07:20.440 --> 07:23.068
- Hi.
. Hi.

07:24.152 --> 07:26.112
Are you guys talking about me?

07:26.196 --> 07:27.989
'Cause whatever it is, I didn't do it.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.157
No.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.868
Back to my dream.

07:31.951 --> 07:33.620
Tasty.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.040
Well, don't worry, you'll see.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.542
I'm the headliner. I got this.

07:40.960 --> 07:42.337
I'm gonna fix the show.

07:42.420 --> 07:43.505
Yes.

07:45.715 --> 07:46.883
You will, my friend.

07:48.385 --> 07:49.719
You are the headliner.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.059
Let's give 'em a great show, okay?

07:56.851 --> 08:00.355
We're in this together, kid.
I know we can turn this around.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.235
That's my boy.

08:05.318 --> 08:07.612
All right, curtain up in ten minutes.

08:07.696 --> 08:10.448
- All right, Murph. Showtime.
- It's all under control.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.534
It's all under control.

08:12.617 --> 08:16.204
Do the words "Bird for sale"
mean anything to you? Do they?

08:16.287 --> 08:18.581
- "Bird for sale"?
- Yeah, well, just remember that.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.969
- That is our show.
- Nailed it.

08:31.052 --> 08:32.971
I hope you enjoyed yourselves.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.682
- Still, not a lot of people out there.
- Thank you. Ta-ta!

08:49.362 --> 08:50.363
Ivan!

08:51.489 --> 08:53.283
I have something for you.

08:54.909 --> 08:58.663
Sometimes when I'm drawing,
I see you watching me.

08:59.247 --> 09:00.832
I just got some new crayons.

09:00.915 --> 09:03.626
So, I thought maybe
you'd like my old ones?

09:04.753 --> 09:05.754
Here.

09:06.338 --> 09:07.964
They're a little broken.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.887
- You good?
- Yeah.

09:13.970 --> 09:16.222
All right. Let's go, honey.

09:16.306 --> 09:17.640
Good night, Ivan.

09:18.391 --> 09:19.559
Good night, Uncle Mack!

09:19.642 --> 09:20.894
Night.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.361
What are you gonna do with that?

09:30.278 --> 09:31.529
I'm not sure.

09:31.613 --> 09:33.782
I'd probably eat it.

09:35.116 --> 09:37.535
- It's a crayon.
- I know it's a crayon.

09:37.619 --> 09:40.330
Listen.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.667
- It's raining kibble up there.
- I'm starvin'.

09:43.750 --> 09:46.753
- Don't you wish you could have some?
- It's like a dream come true.

09:46.836 --> 09:48.963
Let's hope he's not
hangin' around tonight.

09:49.422 --> 09:52.175
All right.
See you in the morning, Snickers.

09:52.258 --> 09:53.510
Bingo.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.429
- You better hide.
- He's never gonna catch me.

09:56.513 --> 09:58.932
He's comin'.
You're skating on thin ice, buddy.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.266
That dog!

10:01.434 --> 10:02.727
- Castello!
- I told ya.

10:02.811 --> 10:04.020
Castello!

10:04.104 --> 10:05.689
Yeah, Mack, what's up?

10:05.772 --> 10:06.773
What's up?

10:07.482 --> 10:08.817
My blood pressure.

10:08.900 --> 10:10.276
Are you kidding me?

10:10.360 --> 10:14.447
How many times have I gotta tell you
to get that mutt outta here?

10:14.531 --> 10:18.118
Look, your job
is to keep our animals in their cages

10:18.201 --> 10:20.537
and all other animals out!

10:21.913 --> 10:24.916
The last thing we need around here
is another mouth to feed.

10:25.000 --> 10:26.835
You got it, Mack. It's under control.

10:26.918 --> 10:29.129
- It's all under control.
- Sure it is.

10:29.212 --> 10:31.923
Under control. It's all under control.

10:50.066 --> 10:51.109
Ha.

10:51.192 --> 10:52.193
Loser.

10:59.617 --> 11:00.618
Crayons.

11:01.661 --> 11:03.204
What would I draw anyway?

11:07.292 --> 11:09.294
Hello, Mr. Beetle.

11:23.641 --> 11:24.642
Wha...

11:25.518 --> 11:29.230
- What is it? A flying cow?
- No.

11:29.314 --> 11:30.482
- Is it a hand?
- Nah.

11:30.565 --> 11:33.109
- Hands are so tough to get right.
- Really?

11:33.193 --> 11:34.402
- Is it Tennessee?
- No.

11:34.486 --> 11:35.612
- Kansas.
- Boy.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.113
- Is that me?
- Wh-What?

11:37.197 --> 11:39.366
- Did you draw a picture of me?
- No.

11:39.449 --> 11:42.619
- I know! It's a burrito.
- No, it's not a burrito. It's a...

11:42.702 --> 11:45.288
No, no, no. Don't tell me.
Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

11:45.372 --> 11:50.126
It's a lonely haystack
on a late summer day.

11:52.796 --> 11:54.130
It's a beetle.

11:55.048 --> 11:58.885
A beetle?
I never would've guessed.

12:00.136 --> 12:03.014
A beetle.
Right, there are the legs. I see the legs.

12:03.098 --> 12:04.974
- Thanks for the raisins.
- You're welcome.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.894
- Here, you want one?
- You know I can't eat raisins.

12:18.780 --> 12:20.240
- Morning, Mike.
- Mack.

12:22.534 --> 12:25.954
- What's going on?
- I might have better luck at the galleria.

12:26.037 --> 12:29.207
No, Mike. That's a mistake.
That's a... That's a big mistake.

12:29.874 --> 12:32.127
Things will be picking up
around here in no time.

12:32.627 --> 12:34.337
You know, it's ebb and flow.

12:34.421 --> 12:37.716
I know all about the ebb.
I haven't seen the flow in a while.

12:38.383 --> 12:39.384
Yeah.

12:40.343 --> 12:41.970
Well, good luck.

12:43.054 --> 12:44.055
You too.

12:54.733 --> 12:57.444
And that is our show.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

12:57.527 --> 13:00.822
Please, do remember to tell your friends.

13:00.905 --> 13:03.867
If you please?
And thank you again for coming.

13:03.950 --> 13:04.951
Ta-ta.

13:08.246 --> 13:11.583
Ho! This is the game changer
we've been waiting for.

13:13.043 --> 13:15.170
"Made my day"? You've made my year!

13:15.670 --> 13:17.510
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
We'll see you in the morning.

13:17.589 --> 13:18.631
And thank you.

13:20.342 --> 13:23.428
Hey, Ivan.
My heart's still racing from your show.

13:24.637 --> 13:28.099
- Really?
- Yeah, I mean, that was real rage, right?

13:28.183 --> 13:29.976
Whatcha do, stick pins in your feet?

13:30.060 --> 13:32.020
No. I was acting.

13:32.103 --> 13:34.939
What? You should be teaching a class.

13:35.023 --> 13:36.649
Thanks, man.

13:36.733 --> 13:37.859
Look what I drew.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.946
- What's this?
- Aw, look at that.

13:42.030 --> 13:44.074
I know you're not really meant to be here,

13:44.157 --> 13:46.368
but now you're not just any dog.

13:47.035 --> 13:48.078
You have a name.

13:48.703 --> 13:50.705
- Bob.
- That's nice.

13:50.789 --> 13:52.707
A little presumptuous, don't you think?

13:52.791 --> 13:54.292
What's "presumptuous" mean?

13:57.170 --> 13:58.171
Whoa.

14:00.715 --> 14:03.176
- Dad, come look at this!
- Here comes the old man.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.260
Get outta here.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.054
Look what Ivan drew.

14:06.638 --> 14:08.723
Look at that.
He made a little scribble?

14:08.807 --> 14:10.183
It's not a scribble.

14:10.850 --> 14:11.851
It's a beetle.

14:13.812 --> 14:14.938
He drew a beetle.

14:16.439 --> 14:20.485
Well, I guess you need
an artist's eye to see it?

14:20.568 --> 14:21.569
Like yours?

14:23.488 --> 14:25.240
- You ready to go home to Mom?
- Yeah.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.950
All right, say your good nights.

14:27.992 --> 14:28.993
Night, Ivan.

14:33.665 --> 14:34.666
Night, Bob.

14:38.378 --> 14:41.214
Did you call the little dog "Bob"?

14:41.881 --> 14:43.717
Yeah, that's his name.

14:43.800 --> 14:45.051
"Bob"?

14:46.344 --> 14:49.305
Why do they think
they can go around naming everything?

14:50.056 --> 14:53.226
If she weren't so cute,
I'd nip her on the nose.

15:02.235 --> 15:04.738
This is gonna be exciting.
Today is the day!

15:04.821 --> 15:07.240
You wanna come with me, Snickers?

15:07.323 --> 15:09.367
- Where're they going?
- All right.

15:09.451 --> 15:12.912
Curiosity killed the cat, but fed the dog.

15:13.455 --> 15:16.332
Operation Kibble, go!

15:16.833 --> 15:18.251
We're in.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.795
There it is.

15:21.963 --> 15:25.717
Kibble. Alone at last.

15:26.051 --> 15:28.553
Whoa. That feels good.

15:29.262 --> 15:32.057
Soft.

15:34.184 --> 15:36.728
So this is how it feels.

15:36.811 --> 15:39.606
So relaxing.

15:39.689 --> 15:40.690
Ooh!

15:40.774 --> 15:41.858
Was that me?

15:45.403 --> 15:48.615
She won't mind. Okay, where was I?

15:49.157 --> 15:51.993
Now we're talking.

15:53.536 --> 15:55.330
Yeah.

15:55.413 --> 15:56.873
Enjoying yourself?

15:56.956 --> 15:59.042
Hey, Snickers, you're back.

16:00.418 --> 16:01.753
Time for a shampoo?

16:01.836 --> 16:03.505
That you're never gonna see.

16:03.588 --> 16:05.173
Come on.

16:05.256 --> 16:07.926
Why don't you just give in to domesticity?

16:08.009 --> 16:11.388
'Cause I... I like my freedom,
thank you very much.

16:11.805 --> 16:13.765
May I?

16:13.848 --> 16:18.311
Well, then, you'll just have to keep on
eating leftovers and sleeping on cement.

16:18.812 --> 16:20.689
I never sleep on cement.

16:20.772 --> 16:22.107
I sleep on Ivan.

16:22.774 --> 16:26.653
Speaking of which, I gotta go get him
pumped up for the show.

16:26.736 --> 16:29.030
- No, there is no show.
- What?

16:29.114 --> 16:31.032
- The show's been canceled.
- Why?

16:31.116 --> 16:34.160
Well, there's a new animal
being delivered.

16:36.246 --> 16:38.623
Don't tell anyone. They might get upset.

16:38.707 --> 16:41.668
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
This is just between you and me.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.714
Ivan! The show's canceled!

16:45.797 --> 16:47.757
- Canceled?
- New animal being delivered.

16:47.841 --> 16:51.219
New animal on the way!
New animal is coming!

16:51.302 --> 16:53.054
Hey, a new animal, Stella.

16:53.138 --> 16:54.889
- A new animal?
- Yeah!

16:54.973 --> 16:57.475
You've gotta love him.

16:57.559 --> 17:00.311
Henrietta, Murphy,
we got a new friend coming.

17:00.395 --> 17:01.771
- Ooh!
- Hey, party time.

17:01.855 --> 17:04.774
- Where're we gonna put him?
- Keep that ball in the air, Frankie.

17:04.858 --> 17:06.276
We got a new animal comin'.

17:06.359 --> 17:08.445
Like I'm not under enough pressure.

17:08.528 --> 17:10.655
Hey, Ivan, could be another gorilla.

17:10.739 --> 17:13.491
- You think?
- Maybe it's a new species.

17:13.575 --> 17:16.661
Flying squirrels or singing mice.

17:16.745 --> 17:17.746
In that thing?

17:19.080 --> 17:20.999
Here it is. It's a big day!

17:21.082 --> 17:22.834
A big day. Come on, let's open it up.

17:23.960 --> 17:25.253
Am I being replaced?

17:25.337 --> 17:29.174
Frankie, you can't be replaced.
You've got a unique talent.

17:29.632 --> 17:30.633
Thank you.

17:35.513 --> 17:36.514
Ooh.

17:39.601 --> 17:40.602
Wow.

17:40.685 --> 17:44.314
I hate surprises. I can't look.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.398
Hi there.

17:46.775 --> 17:49.361
Aren't you the cutest little thing?

17:49.444 --> 17:51.071
Hi. Yes.

17:53.365 --> 17:55.367
I'm starting to like this animal.

17:55.450 --> 17:57.369
George?

17:58.244 --> 17:59.746
I think I'm gonna need some help.

18:01.915 --> 18:05.752
Yeah, look at that, George.
She knows what to do.

18:11.758 --> 18:13.134
That's right, Stella.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.006
A baby.

18:54.968 --> 18:55.969
Aw.

19:03.643 --> 19:04.811
You see that?

19:10.025 --> 19:12.444
Hey there. How you doin'?

19:15.947 --> 19:18.658
Look at Stella. I knew she'd do it.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.326
Great job, honey.

19:20.410 --> 19:22.328
I was hoping for a lady bunny.

19:22.954 --> 19:24.247
Hey.

19:24.330 --> 19:26.332
- That's amazing.
- It's a great idea, Mack.

19:26.416 --> 19:29.836
Yeah, and I got her cheap too.
From a bankrupt circus in New Jersey.

19:34.257 --> 19:37.177
- Everybody loves baby animals.
- Yeah.

19:37.260 --> 19:39.763
Welcome to your new home.

19:40.180 --> 19:41.389
Her name is Ruby.

19:42.390 --> 19:43.850
She's never performed,

19:43.933 --> 19:47.604
but she's gonna
turn this show around in no time.

19:47.687 --> 19:48.688
Look at her.

19:49.773 --> 19:51.816
She's just what we needed.

19:51.900 --> 19:54.277
Bless you.

19:55.403 --> 19:58.490
Ruby, Ruby. So sweet, so sweet.

19:58.573 --> 19:59.824
Cutie patootie.

19:59.908 --> 20:02.202
She is the cutest.

20:02.285 --> 20:03.495
Does she have any talent,

20:03.578 --> 20:06.206
or are they just gonna
put her in a fire truck like you?

20:06.289 --> 20:08.958
Hey! Watch it, chicken.

20:15.965 --> 20:18.176
She's gonna turn this show around?

20:37.529 --> 20:40.281
- Are you a monkey?
- Am I a what?

20:40.365 --> 20:42.075
Are you a monkey?

20:42.158 --> 20:44.869
What are you... No, I'm a gorilla.

20:46.287 --> 20:47.956
Where are the other gorillas?

20:48.707 --> 20:50.333
There are no other gorillas.

20:50.417 --> 20:53.461
Well... who's that?

20:53.545 --> 20:57.173
That's Not-Tag.
Don't touch her. She's not real.

20:57.757 --> 20:59.843
Why is she named Not-Tag?

20:59.926 --> 21:00.969
It's a long story.

21:01.052 --> 21:05.223
- Ooh, I love stories!
- I'm sure you do, but I'm-I'm busy.

21:05.306 --> 21:06.808
You don't look busy.

21:06.891 --> 21:08.435
Looks are deceiving.

21:10.395 --> 21:12.188
I'm sorry there are no other gorillas.

21:12.272 --> 21:14.858
Well, I'm not.
'Cause it's always just been me.

21:14.941 --> 21:18.445
"The One and Only Ivan."
That's what it says on the billboard.

21:18.528 --> 21:20.697
Ivan's always been the headliner here.

21:20.780 --> 21:22.407
You hear that? The headliner.

21:22.490 --> 21:24.784
Wow! Why?

21:24.868 --> 21:28.288
Because he's a silverback.
He terrifies humans.

21:28.371 --> 21:30.707
You're not terrifying.

21:30.790 --> 21:33.793
Yeah, I am. I'm very scary.

21:33.877 --> 21:35.628
So, you know, run along,

21:35.712 --> 21:38.340
before I start thumping
and roaring with rage.

21:46.097 --> 21:49.684
And now,
the moment you've all been waiting for.

21:49.768 --> 21:52.062
Hey, hey, hey. I'm not finished.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.397
Our new headliner.

21:54.481 --> 21:55.482
What?

21:55.565 --> 22:00.528
Introducing
the new addition to the family, Ruby!

22:02.405 --> 22:04.157
Aw!

22:09.537 --> 22:11.456
- Hello, Ruby.
- She's coming towards us.

22:27.138 --> 22:28.640
Go, Ruby!

22:28.723 --> 22:30.725
I've never heard applause
like that before.

22:30.809 --> 22:32.644
They even clapped extra for me.

22:32.727 --> 22:35.689
That little angel is the best thing
that could ever happen to us.

22:35.772 --> 22:37.649
- Ivan?
- Shh. Sleeping.

22:37.732 --> 22:39.859
Why does the rabbit drive a fire truck?

22:39.943 --> 22:40.944
Sleeping.

22:41.027 --> 22:44.280
- Why does the seal worry so much?
- Go back to bed, Ruby.

22:44.364 --> 22:47.200
- Ever seen a lion? I have...
- Is this kid for real?

22:47.283 --> 22:48.743
- Know any jokes?
- I...

22:48.827 --> 22:49.953
I do.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.664
How do you know
an elephant has been in the refrigerator?

22:52.747 --> 22:55.333
Footprints in the butter!

22:55.417 --> 22:58.086
Isn't that funny?

22:58.169 --> 23:00.922
I'm hungry. I love carrots.

23:01.006 --> 23:02.382
What's your favorite food?

23:02.465 --> 23:05.051
Tell her. It might shut her up.

23:06.928 --> 23:08.054
Yogurt raisins.

23:09.723 --> 23:11.474
All right. I'm gonna let go.

23:13.184 --> 23:14.185
Whoa.

23:15.854 --> 23:19.607
We gotta look our best today.
Just like old times.

23:25.822 --> 23:27.824
Who's next? What would you like?

23:28.575 --> 23:30.326
Here to see Baby Ruby?

23:30.410 --> 23:32.370
- There you are, young lady.
- New star.

23:32.454 --> 23:34.873
- Nice to see you. Thank you.
- Enjoy the show.

23:34.956 --> 23:37.250
Perfect! Enjoy the show.

23:45.759 --> 23:47.510
She's a flash in the pan.

23:48.553 --> 23:50.722
Babies don't stay babies forever.

23:50.805 --> 23:52.474
Your appeal is timeless.

23:52.557 --> 23:55.018
It's not the baby's job to save the troop.

23:55.685 --> 23:57.520
It's the job of a silverback.

23:57.604 --> 23:58.938
It's my job.

23:59.022 --> 24:01.858
I don't think she got the memo.

24:13.453 --> 24:14.579
Hi, baby.

24:15.205 --> 24:18.291
You're doing so well in the show.
Everybody's coming to see you.

24:19.959 --> 24:23.213
Hey, Stella.
Isn't it amazing how big the crowds are?

24:30.887 --> 24:31.888
Dad.

24:32.514 --> 24:33.515
Dad!

24:33.598 --> 24:34.599
Yeah?

24:34.683 --> 24:37.560
Stella's doing something funny
with her foot again.

24:41.314 --> 24:42.357
Mack!

24:44.818 --> 24:46.236
What is it?

24:47.362 --> 24:48.947
It is a bit swollen.

24:50.949 --> 24:52.283
Is it tender?

24:53.702 --> 24:55.453
All right, lift.

24:55.537 --> 24:57.747
Let's take a look here.

24:58.915 --> 25:01.668
Well... Something's not right.

25:02.502 --> 25:05.880
It's okay, Stella. It's okay, girl.

25:08.091 --> 25:09.092
Well,

25:10.010 --> 25:11.678
I don't see anything, but...

25:12.679 --> 25:17.183
she could have something lodged in there
or could be an infection.

25:18.143 --> 25:20.061
And she does seem to be hurting.

25:20.770 --> 25:23.148
Make sure there's aspirin
in her food tonight.

25:24.274 --> 25:26.401
The vet will be here
first thing in the morning.

25:27.652 --> 25:30.488
You hang tough, sister. We need you.

25:36.369 --> 25:39.748
She'll be all right.
She's a strong old girl, okay?

25:40.957 --> 25:43.126
Okay, Stella, let's rest now.

25:49.299 --> 25:51.176
All right! Come on!

25:51.968 --> 25:53.136
Come on!

25:55.847 --> 25:59.392
You're doing so great in the show, Ruby.

25:59.476 --> 26:02.520
Thanks, Aunt Stella.
I'm sorry about your foot.

26:02.604 --> 26:06.649
It's just tired of carrying me around
all these years.

26:06.733 --> 26:09.194
Now, would you like to hear another story?

26:09.277 --> 26:12.030
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

26:14.407 --> 26:16.034
Hey, why'd you do that?

26:16.117 --> 26:19.662
This is a good one
from when I was a baby in the wild.

26:21.081 --> 26:22.165
One day...

26:23.083 --> 26:24.834
I was out looking for water...

26:26.044 --> 26:28.755
when I slipped and fell into a hole

26:28.838 --> 26:31.174
and got stuck in some very deep mud.

26:32.342 --> 26:34.636
- Just then, a little girl...
- Like Julia!

26:34.719 --> 26:37.180
Just like Julia... heard my cries.

26:37.263 --> 26:39.766
She told her whole village,

26:39.849 --> 26:43.395
and together they all came and freed me.

26:43.478 --> 26:45.146
Wow!

26:45.230 --> 26:46.815
Humans did that?

26:46.898 --> 26:47.899
I don't believe it.

26:47.982 --> 26:49.984
Not all humans are bad.

26:50.568 --> 26:52.028
They can surprise you.

26:54.447 --> 26:58.118
Are all animals free in the wild?

26:58.201 --> 26:59.202
Yes.

26:59.786 --> 27:03.081
Well... will we ever be free?

27:04.666 --> 27:08.044
There are places, not very far from here.

27:08.712 --> 27:09.879
Safe places.

27:10.588 --> 27:13.925
With trees, and grass, and lakes.

27:14.968 --> 27:17.178
Where animals can roam free.

27:17.262 --> 27:20.098
- The wild.
- Like the wild.

27:20.890 --> 27:22.934
Where humans make amends.

27:25.895 --> 27:29.149
Now, let's try to get some sleep.

27:29.232 --> 27:30.567
Okay.

27:30.650 --> 27:32.485
- Good night.
- Good night.

27:35.447 --> 27:36.448
Good night, Ivan.

27:36.531 --> 27:37.532
Wh...

27:39.325 --> 27:40.410
Good night.

27:47.375 --> 27:49.711
- Ivan! Showtime.
- Ivan. Showtime.

27:50.211 --> 27:51.379
Hey, Mack.

27:52.672 --> 27:54.632
I'm not sure Stella should go on.

27:55.508 --> 27:56.509
Really?

27:57.469 --> 27:59.304
She's not putting any weight on it.

28:00.805 --> 28:03.975
That's not good.
All right, let's let her rest.

28:04.059 --> 28:05.977
I'll call the vet again after the show.

28:06.936 --> 28:07.937
Ruby.

28:09.397 --> 28:10.523
Attagirl.

28:10.899 --> 28:12.984
You're gonna be flying solo today.

28:14.069 --> 28:16.654
You can do it. Right, sweetheart?

28:16.738 --> 28:17.822
She'll be fine.

28:21.618 --> 28:24.871
I'm not sure this is a good idea,
Aunt Stella.

28:24.954 --> 28:27.123
And now, ladies and gentlemen...

28:27.207 --> 28:30.794
the tiny tyke
you've all been waiting for.

28:30.877 --> 28:33.254
I can't do it without you. I'm scared.

28:33.338 --> 28:35.924
Ivan, she's gonna miss her cue.

28:36.007 --> 28:37.008
What?

28:37.926 --> 28:39.886
Ruby!

28:41.721 --> 28:44.307
- I-I won't know what to do.
- I'll be watching.

28:44.391 --> 28:46.726
Listen, kid. You gotta go out there.

28:46.810 --> 28:48.103
I-I can't do it.

28:48.186 --> 28:50.605
Hey, they're here to see you.
You can't let everyone down.

28:51.648 --> 28:52.899
But I'm scared.

28:56.569 --> 28:57.946
Ruby!

29:01.241 --> 29:03.952
Listen to me. They're gonna love you.

29:04.369 --> 29:06.705
Really? Are you sure?

29:06.788 --> 29:10.125
Sure, I'm sure.
You don't even have to do anything.

29:10.208 --> 29:12.919
Just stand out there and be you.

29:13.003 --> 29:18.008
Shall we try it again?
Ladies and gentlemen, Ruby!

29:19.467 --> 29:20.468
Come on.

29:22.595 --> 29:23.805
You can do it.

29:33.565 --> 29:34.941
Peekaboo.

29:37.485 --> 29:39.904
Aw!

29:39.988 --> 29:41.239
Look at you.

29:41.322 --> 29:42.741
Hello.

29:43.575 --> 29:45.660
Come on out and say hello to everyone.

29:47.412 --> 29:51.041
All these lovely boys and girls
have come to say hello to you.

29:53.084 --> 29:55.295
Yes, they have. Hello there.

29:57.088 --> 29:58.340
Hello, little lady.

30:01.926 --> 30:03.553
Ruby!

30:05.930 --> 30:07.932
Well, she did it.

30:09.642 --> 30:10.643
She did.

30:26.701 --> 30:29.037
Hey, Ruby. You can't sleep?

30:29.579 --> 30:30.914
I'm hungry.

30:32.082 --> 30:33.083
Well...

30:34.125 --> 30:35.585
how about I...

30:36.086 --> 30:38.380
I'll draw you a carrot.

30:38.463 --> 30:40.840
To tide you over until you get a real one.

30:40.924 --> 30:43.718
You know how to draw?

30:43.802 --> 30:47.055
Yeah. But don't tell anybody.

30:47.138 --> 30:49.057
- Why?
- Because I'm a silverback.

30:49.140 --> 30:50.141
So?

30:50.225 --> 30:53.937
So just don't say anything, because...
Well, then everybody will want one.

30:54.020 --> 30:56.815
Then what am I gonna do?
Then I got no time to be ferocious.

30:57.899 --> 30:58.983
Wow!

30:59.067 --> 31:01.319
That's a great carrot.

31:01.403 --> 31:03.071
It'll just be our secret, okay?

31:03.154 --> 31:04.781
Okay. I love secrets.

31:04.864 --> 31:06.241
- Promise?
- I promise.

31:07.283 --> 31:09.411
- Aunt Stella!
- No, no, no, no!

31:09.494 --> 31:11.996
Shh, shh, shh, shh. D-Don't wake her.

31:12.747 --> 31:14.833
- Do you wanna hear a story?
- Yes, please.

31:14.916 --> 31:17.544
Like one of Stella's stories,
from when you were little.

31:17.627 --> 31:19.713
Well...

31:20.880 --> 31:23.216
I don't remember things
from when I was little, I...

31:23.299 --> 31:24.300
Yeah.

31:24.384 --> 31:28.179
He's the total opposite of an elephant.
He can't remember a thing.

31:28.888 --> 31:31.433
- You wanna hear about my life?
- Yes.

31:32.100 --> 31:33.393
Okay.

31:33.476 --> 31:35.228
Well, I was living a pretty good life

31:35.311 --> 31:38.481
until I was abandoned in the streets
by a mean human being.

31:39.649 --> 31:42.902
Then I fell off a bridge into a river
and almost drowned.

31:42.986 --> 31:45.113
That's it. End of story. Now go to sleep.

31:45.196 --> 31:48.491
Okay. That's... Thanks.
That's not a bedtime story.

31:48.575 --> 31:51.244
Guess not.
It's got a happy ending though.

31:51.327 --> 31:54.122
I ended up here with you,
my best buddy ole pal.

31:56.708 --> 31:59.210
Okay, Ruby,
I think I might have a story for ya.

31:59.294 --> 32:01.755
- Really?
- Yeah.

32:02.881 --> 32:05.592
Okay. All right.

32:05.675 --> 32:06.676
Um...

32:09.179 --> 32:12.891
So, once there was
a little baby gorilla named...

32:12.974 --> 32:13.975
Ivan!

32:15.477 --> 32:18.688
Yeah. Okay. Ivan.

32:18.772 --> 32:22.359
- There you go.
- And little Ivan, he wore diapers.

32:22.442 --> 32:23.943
And he drank from a bottle.

32:24.027 --> 32:25.362
We're rolling.

32:25.445 --> 32:28.239
And he had two nice human friends
that adopted him.

32:28.323 --> 32:29.407
Come here.

32:29.491 --> 32:31.785
They spent every waking minute together.

32:32.994 --> 32:34.996
What're you lookin' at? Your papa?

32:35.080 --> 32:36.998
He lived in a nice house.

32:37.791 --> 32:39.793
And he slept in human beds.

32:41.169 --> 32:42.462
And he was loved.

32:43.588 --> 32:48.635
And he was so lucky 'cause he got
to go to restaurants, and baseball games,

32:49.219 --> 32:52.138
and movie theaters, and playgrounds.

32:52.222 --> 32:55.058
- Higher!
- Playgrounds were his favorite.

32:55.141 --> 32:58.103
People stared, but he never even noticed.

32:58.186 --> 33:00.897
Felt like the whole world
was his playground.

33:00.980 --> 33:02.232
Ready? Smile.

33:02.315 --> 33:04.984
- Back before Mack thought of the show...
- Perfect.

33:05.068 --> 33:07.737
It was just a young gorilla
in a photo booth.

33:07.821 --> 33:11.866
But still, people came from far and wide
to see the young gorilla.

33:11.950 --> 33:14.703
- And who's next?
- It was a nice life.

33:15.453 --> 33:18.123
But the little gorilla did
what gorillas do.

33:18.873 --> 33:23.545
- He made mess. A lot of messes.
- What have you done? My gosh.

33:23.628 --> 33:25.797
Hey. He found the cake, honey.

33:25.880 --> 33:26.965
I can see that.

33:27.048 --> 33:29.426
He turned the world into his playground.

33:29.509 --> 33:30.885
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

33:30.969 --> 33:32.929
No.

33:33.013 --> 33:36.224
Little Ivan had a lot of freedom,
and he enjoyed it.

33:37.684 --> 33:40.562
Sometimes his human friends
would get very upset.

33:42.105 --> 33:44.232
And the little gorilla didn't know why.

33:46.317 --> 33:47.318
Helen?

33:47.402 --> 33:50.113
One of 'em got so upset, she left.

33:51.448 --> 33:53.199
And she never came back.

34:01.291 --> 34:04.044
- And then one day, he came here.
- Go ahead.

34:05.503 --> 34:08.089
He had a new home built just for him.

34:09.257 --> 34:11.968
And he's been here ever since.

34:14.346 --> 34:15.347
Good night, Ruby.

34:18.933 --> 34:19.934
Ivan?

34:24.606 --> 34:26.816
I need you to promise me something.

34:27.609 --> 34:28.610
Anything.

34:31.071 --> 34:33.406
I need you to take care of Ruby.

34:35.950 --> 34:37.702
I can't be here for her.

34:40.246 --> 34:43.625
I want her to have a life
different from mine.

34:45.710 --> 34:47.754
I want her to be free.

34:49.130 --> 34:51.883
In a safe place. Not...

34:51.966 --> 34:53.426
Not here.

34:53.510 --> 34:54.928
Not a cage.

34:56.012 --> 34:57.138
Promise me.

35:00.767 --> 35:02.477
I promise, Stella.

35:02.560 --> 35:06.773
On my word as a silverback, I promise.

35:09.901 --> 35:11.111
Thank you, Ivan.

35:21.955 --> 35:23.123
Goodbye.

37:13.608 --> 37:15.902
Come on. Get it together.

37:35.714 --> 37:37.507
You're on your own now, Ruby.

37:40.176 --> 37:41.177
So,

37:41.970 --> 37:44.806
we gotta work on your act?

37:48.226 --> 37:49.477
We'll start tomorrow.

37:54.065 --> 37:55.150
Good night, girl.

38:28.516 --> 38:30.810
How is she? How's-How's Ruby?

38:30.894 --> 38:32.228
Better now.

38:32.312 --> 38:35.106
I told her not to worry
'cause you were gonna save her.

38:35.607 --> 38:37.650
What? What are you talking about?

38:37.734 --> 38:39.986
You promised Stella
you were gonna get Ruby outta here.

38:40.070 --> 38:41.237
Are you outta your mind?

38:41.321 --> 38:44.741
So she could be free.
Have a great life. Remember?

38:44.824 --> 38:48.119
Anyway, that cheered her up.
She fell right to sleep.

38:48.203 --> 38:49.913
Shouldn't have even made that promise.

38:49.996 --> 38:53.333
How am I supposed to get her outta here?
And where would we go?

38:53.875 --> 38:57.504
And what about Mack?
Yeah, he's taken care of me my whole life.

38:58.588 --> 38:59.881
You'll figure it out.

39:01.466 --> 39:04.094
You're the one and only Ivan. Remember?

39:04.177 --> 39:05.178
Nah.

39:11.017 --> 39:12.018
Say it.

39:13.311 --> 39:15.271
Go on. Say it.

39:18.233 --> 39:20.235
I'm the one and only Ivan.

39:22.237 --> 39:25.073
And don't you ever forget it.

39:41.673 --> 39:42.674
Scoot over.

39:49.973 --> 39:51.266
She's up there.

39:52.267 --> 39:53.893
Can you see her smiling?

40:01.026 --> 40:03.528
It's 'cause she knows
you're gonna figure this out.

40:26.801 --> 40:30.221
Come on. Quit it, will ya?

40:31.765 --> 40:33.725
It's disgusting.

40:34.559 --> 40:36.895
Ivan. You're gonna wanna see this.

40:37.437 --> 40:38.438
What is it?

40:41.941 --> 40:43.401
- Come on!
- Okay.

40:48.073 --> 40:51.201
You're gonna need to learn a few tricks,
Ruby. Just like Stella.

40:51.284 --> 40:52.869
It'll be fun.

40:54.079 --> 40:56.122
No, come on back. Right here.

40:56.206 --> 40:58.792
There we go. Nice, big, even circle.

40:59.542 --> 41:00.543
All right?

41:02.796 --> 41:05.590
Yes. There you go. Nicely done.

41:05.674 --> 41:08.343
Good, good, good, good. There you go.

41:08.426 --> 41:11.763
Keep going. Attagirl. You can do it.

41:11.846 --> 41:15.141
There you go. Okay, come on.
You can get this. Trunk up.

41:17.602 --> 41:20.355
Come on, you gotta do this on your own,
Ruby. Trunk up.

41:20.438 --> 41:22.399
Here we go. No, no, no. Here, trunk up.

41:23.149 --> 41:26.361
And keep it up.
Come on, Ruby, it's not that hard.

41:26.444 --> 41:29.364
Let's do this again
like you did this morning. Lift.

41:30.031 --> 41:32.826
Lift. No, right here. Lift.

41:32.909 --> 41:37.580
Lift. That's it! We're finally
making progress. Okay, right leg. Lift.

41:38.164 --> 41:42.168
Up. You're gonna have to learn to balance
on this. Here we go. Lift. Come on.

41:42.252 --> 41:45.380
That's it. No, no, no, no, no, no.
That one stays up.

41:45.463 --> 41:47.674
Left. No, no, no. Where're you going?

41:47.757 --> 41:49.009
Where're you going? Ruby.

41:53.847 --> 41:56.558
Come on. Here we go.
Right here. Let's try again.

41:56.641 --> 41:58.309
Lift. Lift.

41:58.393 --> 41:59.936
Lift! That's it.

42:00.020 --> 42:02.188
Dad, she looks tired.

42:02.272 --> 42:05.150
Yeah, well, hey. We're all tired, right?

42:05.984 --> 42:09.779
I mean, am I the only one who understands
that we got to make a living here?

42:11.489 --> 42:14.826
Okay, let's go. Other foot. Here we go.
Lift. Lift, lift.

42:15.910 --> 42:19.247
Hey, Mack? Hey, let's call it a day.
I'll take Ruby back.

42:19.330 --> 42:20.999
- You can take a break.
- No.

42:21.082 --> 42:24.544
We're finally making progress here.
No, I am not giving up now.

42:24.627 --> 42:26.838
And we are not canceling
any more shows either.

42:26.921 --> 42:28.923
No, Ruby. Ruby, no, no, no, come on.

42:29.007 --> 42:30.508
Don't sit. No, no, no.

42:30.592 --> 42:33.011
- Okay. Put our things away.
- Come on. Come on.

42:33.094 --> 42:36.056
No. Come here. We got to get up.

42:36.139 --> 42:38.933
Come on. Let's go. Ruby. Come on. Up.

42:39.017 --> 42:41.102
Let's get up. Come on. You gotta get up.

42:41.186 --> 42:44.147
Come on. No, come on.
You gotta get up. You gotta learn this.

42:44.230 --> 42:46.274
- Mack.
- Ruby. No, come on. We can do this.

42:46.358 --> 42:47.692
Come on. Get up.

42:51.988 --> 42:54.783
What?

42:54.866 --> 42:55.867
Wow.

43:04.918 --> 43:07.295
Holy moly.

43:28.942 --> 43:31.319
Wow. Look at all those drawings.

43:32.028 --> 43:34.823
I always kinda figured you were an artist.

43:34.906 --> 43:37.033
I think we're all a little artsy.

43:37.575 --> 43:41.621
Sometimes I arrange my popcorn
on the floor in cute little patterns.

43:41.705 --> 43:43.373
Hey! Why'd you do that?

43:43.456 --> 43:44.916
Yeow!

43:45.000 --> 43:46.251
So gentle.

43:46.334 --> 43:47.335
Shh!

43:48.211 --> 43:49.671
Can you tell what this is?

43:50.922 --> 43:53.341
A Cheeto?

43:53.425 --> 43:54.634
No.

43:54.718 --> 43:56.052
A wig? Mack's wig?

43:56.136 --> 43:57.887
Mack's w... What?

43:57.971 --> 43:59.514
A mountain range?

43:59.597 --> 44:00.849
It's a key.

44:04.060 --> 44:06.438
I need to get Julia to give me the key.

44:06.521 --> 44:10.025
If I had that,
I could free Ruby from her cage.

44:10.442 --> 44:11.693
Cool!

44:11.776 --> 44:14.279
- And then what?
- I don't know. We'd go.

44:14.362 --> 44:16.197
- Go where?
- We'd just go.

44:16.281 --> 44:17.699
Where you gonna go?

44:22.787 --> 44:24.039
The forest.

44:26.082 --> 44:29.794
You know, the forest.
On the other side of the highway.

44:29.878 --> 44:31.546
- The forest.
- Yeah.

44:31.629 --> 44:33.298
- Perfect.
- That's all we need.

44:33.381 --> 44:35.258
- Yeah!
- Trees, grass.

44:35.342 --> 44:38.136
Right. We're wild animals.
That's where we belong.

44:38.219 --> 44:39.220
That's right.

44:39.304 --> 44:40.680
Ivan?

44:40.764 --> 44:42.432
Hey. Ruby.

44:42.932 --> 44:44.434
Sorry, did we wake you up?

44:45.018 --> 44:46.519
Do you wanna hear a story?

44:46.603 --> 44:48.855
Aw. Yes, please.

44:49.606 --> 44:50.982
Okay.

44:51.066 --> 44:53.526
So, once there was a...

44:54.444 --> 44:55.820
a baby elephant.

44:56.446 --> 44:58.907
Who was smart and brave.

44:59.491 --> 45:02.202
But she lived in a small domain.

45:02.285 --> 45:05.955
And she needed to live in the wild,
where she could be free.

45:07.665 --> 45:10.251
Does the baby elephant get to be free?

45:17.467 --> 45:20.261
Yes, because she had a friend.

45:20.345 --> 45:22.138
A friend who made a promise.

45:30.480 --> 45:31.481
Hi, Henrietta.

45:31.940 --> 45:33.566
Hi, Frankie.

45:34.609 --> 45:35.610
Hi, Ivan.

45:37.404 --> 45:38.405
Whoa.

45:42.283 --> 45:43.993
Did you draw all these?

45:44.077 --> 45:47.038
Ivan, these are amazing.

45:47.497 --> 45:49.874
That looks like a...

45:49.958 --> 45:51.876
- Hey, you.
- Hey, Mack.

45:52.669 --> 45:54.587
- New drawings?
- Yeah.

45:55.088 --> 45:56.464
- May I?
- Sure.

46:01.386 --> 46:04.097
- Did you draw these?
- No.

46:04.180 --> 46:06.558
Ivan drew 'em.

46:08.309 --> 46:09.352
Did he?

46:10.603 --> 46:13.314
You know, actually, these aren't too bad.

46:13.398 --> 46:14.899
How about that?

46:15.900 --> 46:17.277
A gorilla who draws.

46:21.990 --> 46:23.491
Gorilla that can draw.

46:25.368 --> 46:28.747
A gorilla who draws!

46:28.830 --> 46:30.123
Ha!

46:30.206 --> 46:32.542
- Now that's somethin'! Boy!
- Dad.

46:32.625 --> 46:34.544
Dad, I told you Ivan can draw. Look.

46:34.627 --> 46:37.797
The press is gonna eat this up!

46:37.881 --> 46:40.967
A gorilla who can actually draw?
Now, that's like... Mwah!

46:41.051 --> 46:42.719
- Aw.
- That's a game changer!

46:42.802 --> 46:43.803
Game changer.

46:45.347 --> 46:47.307
"Ivan the Artistic Ape"?

46:50.060 --> 46:53.313
The owner of the animal show here
at the Big Top Mall and Video Arcade

46:53.396 --> 46:57.108
earlier this week gave some crayons
to the show's silverback gorilla.

46:57.192 --> 47:00.403
People have been coming from far and wide
to see the result.

47:00.487 --> 47:01.988
Is that you, Ivan?

47:02.072 --> 47:03.156
Wha...

47:03.239 --> 47:06.493
Hey, Ivan. Take a look at this.

47:06.576 --> 47:08.912
Crowd's even bigger than the old days.

47:08.995 --> 47:10.622
That is you!

47:14.459 --> 47:16.586
Twice as many as yesterday.

47:19.798 --> 47:22.175
Ivan. Ivan!

47:22.258 --> 47:24.302
Can you hear that crowd?

47:24.386 --> 47:25.512
We're a hit!

47:26.346 --> 47:28.515
We can keep this show going forever!

47:28.598 --> 47:31.851
Ha-ha! You're a headliner again.

47:31.935 --> 47:33.645
All right, come on, let's do this.

47:35.772 --> 47:36.773
No forehead?

47:37.691 --> 47:41.903
All right, we can do it later.
Because right now, it's showtime.

47:41.986 --> 47:42.987
Ha-ha.

47:50.662 --> 47:54.374
And now,
the moment you've all been waiting for!

47:54.833 --> 47:56.209
Our final act.

47:56.292 --> 47:59.087
The Artistic Ape from Exit Eight.

47:59.170 --> 48:01.923
The one and only Ivan!

48:07.846 --> 48:10.265
What will he draw today?

48:11.307 --> 48:16.521
Your silence is appreciated,
because here is the magic!

48:27.657 --> 48:28.658
Any moment...

48:30.160 --> 48:33.997
the magic will be here.

48:47.719 --> 48:50.680
My. Let's try again, shall we?

48:50.764 --> 48:54.934
Ladies and gentlemen, the magic is here!

48:58.521 --> 49:01.483
In the gift shop!

49:01.566 --> 49:04.819
One of Ivan's original paintings
can be yours.

49:04.903 --> 49:09.032
Each one signed
with his trademark thumbprint.

49:09.908 --> 49:12.452
What the heck was that?

49:12.535 --> 49:15.747
A baby elephant
isn't gonna turn things around for us.

49:16.331 --> 49:20.502
This is our chance. You are our chance!

49:21.002 --> 49:23.421
So, come on! Start the...

49:25.256 --> 49:27.801
What the heck? No.

49:28.927 --> 49:30.387
- Castello!
- Yeah?

49:30.470 --> 49:31.513
Get over here!

49:34.057 --> 49:35.767
Come here.

49:35.850 --> 49:37.686
What's that?

49:37.769 --> 49:39.813
If I ever see that dog again,

49:39.896 --> 49:42.357
I'm never gonna see you again,
because you will be fired!

49:42.440 --> 49:43.441
You understand?

49:43.525 --> 49:47.028
Copy that, Mack. No idea
how he got past me. I'm sorry, boss.

49:47.112 --> 49:49.781
Just... get him outta here.

50:01.292 --> 50:04.129
It's too bad you can't have it all.

50:04.212 --> 50:08.174
You can have your freedom, but you gotta
live by your wits with no security.

50:08.258 --> 50:10.051
Or you can have security,

50:10.135 --> 50:12.971
but you're stuck in a cage all day,
doing tricks for humans.

50:13.054 --> 50:14.305
It's a tough call.

50:15.265 --> 50:16.933
Bob, I have a plan.

50:17.017 --> 50:19.310
You just... You just called me Bob.

50:19.394 --> 50:20.687
Yeah. Kinda fits ya.

50:20.770 --> 50:22.981
- You think? "Bob"?
- Yeah.

50:23.064 --> 50:26.443
Bob. Bob-o. Bobby-dog.

50:26.526 --> 50:29.529
- Hey, Bab-ay. Bobby, Bobby.
- Hey! Focus.

50:29.612 --> 50:32.949
For this plan to work,
I'm gonna need your help.

50:41.666 --> 50:43.543
The things I do...

51:36.680 --> 51:39.057
- Nice.
- Let's go!

51:43.895 --> 51:47.232
- Ivan, what's happening?
- I'm gettin' you outta here.

51:47.315 --> 51:48.566
- Really?
- Yeah.

51:48.650 --> 51:51.778
- Neat. Where are you taking me?
- To live in the wild.

51:52.987 --> 51:54.572
What about the others?

51:58.952 --> 52:00.954
Okay, guys, stick together.

52:01.037 --> 52:02.163
Here we go!

52:02.247 --> 52:05.583
Snickers! Snickers! This is it!
The moment of truth!

52:05.667 --> 52:07.794
We're all taking off. Come with us.

52:07.877 --> 52:10.880
- What? And go where?
- The wild.

52:10.964 --> 52:14.467
The what? But I wouldn't last two minutes
in the wild.

52:14.551 --> 52:16.094
- Why?
- Well...

52:16.720 --> 52:18.805
there are no blow-dryers.

52:19.806 --> 52:22.142
Okay.

52:25.437 --> 52:26.813
Locked.

52:28.982 --> 52:30.191
Definitely locked.

52:30.275 --> 52:33.236
Thelma? Are you okay?

52:33.319 --> 52:35.488
It's all under control.

52:35.572 --> 52:36.948
Hey, guys.

52:38.033 --> 52:40.368
- What're you doing?
- The doors are locked.

52:41.578 --> 52:43.621
Of course the doors are locked!

52:43.705 --> 52:45.957
I thought you were 400 pounds
of pure power.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.626
Right.

52:53.048 --> 52:55.216
Now that's what I call an exit.

52:55.300 --> 52:57.677
Wow. It's so big out here.

52:57.761 --> 53:01.431
Follow me, fellas.
I know this lot like the back of my paw.

53:04.642 --> 53:08.813
Guys, this is really chafing my belly.

53:08.897 --> 53:12.484
Come on, Frankie. You hear that alarm?
The po-po will be here any minute.

53:12.567 --> 53:15.987
Let me at 'em.
I'll blast 'em back with my hose.

53:16.863 --> 53:18.907
That rabbit's crazier than I thought.

53:21.743 --> 53:23.661
- Hello?
- Hey, Mack. It's me.

53:23.745 --> 53:27.123
So, I'm locked inside Ivan's cage.

53:27.207 --> 53:28.208
Wait, what?

53:28.291 --> 53:31.544
It's okay. I'm absolutely fine,
'cause Ivan's not here.

53:32.796 --> 53:35.840
- What?
- In fact, none of the animals are here.

53:40.303 --> 53:44.974
Okay. All we have to do
is make it across, and we're finally free.

53:47.936 --> 53:50.772
Well, I'll just cross the road then.

53:51.231 --> 53:53.441
Why would you cross the road, Henrietta?

53:53.983 --> 53:55.527
To get to the other side.

54:00.615 --> 54:01.783
She said it!

54:02.575 --> 54:03.702
Boy.

54:04.661 --> 54:06.955
- That's a good one!
- Classic.

54:11.876 --> 54:15.088
- Are we done?
- Yeah. I'm done.

54:15.171 --> 54:16.965
Okay. Let's go!

54:17.340 --> 54:19.592
Here we go! Whoo!

54:24.139 --> 54:25.890
Whoo!

54:26.516 --> 54:28.435
My truck is stuck.

54:30.020 --> 54:32.272
- Ivan.
- Wha...

54:32.355 --> 54:33.773
M-My truck is stuck.

54:35.191 --> 54:36.776
Ivan...

54:36.860 --> 54:39.988
- Murphy! Get out!
- Reverse!

54:40.071 --> 54:42.490
- What?
- My truck is stuck!

54:42.574 --> 54:45.869
- Ivan!
- Hop out of the truck!

54:49.330 --> 54:52.208
Ivan. I... My truck.

54:52.292 --> 54:54.586
I'm sorry, Murphy.
I know you loved that thing.

54:55.211 --> 54:57.213
- Murphy, baby, you okay?
- I almost died.

54:57.297 --> 54:58.673
You just made it by a hair.

54:58.757 --> 55:01.259
I saw my whole life flash before my eyes.

55:01.343 --> 55:02.635
And?

55:03.887 --> 55:05.680
I think I could do better.

55:05.764 --> 55:07.557
- Come on, let's go.
- Home free.

55:07.640 --> 55:10.226
Look at me. Out in nature.

55:10.310 --> 55:12.187
Just trees and grass and...

55:13.021 --> 55:14.356
empty soda cans.

55:17.067 --> 55:18.068
What?

55:26.910 --> 55:28.078
No, no, no, no.

55:28.161 --> 55:31.164
Hey, Mack!

55:31.247 --> 55:32.374
Unbelievable.

55:36.252 --> 55:38.421
Come on. Come on.

55:50.141 --> 55:53.103
You feel that?
The wind on our faces.

55:53.186 --> 55:55.480
Real dirt beneath our feet...

55:55.563 --> 55:57.148
This is nice.

55:57.232 --> 55:59.359
- Is this it? The wild?
- Yeah!

55:59.442 --> 56:02.070
You did it, Ivan. You saved us.

56:02.153 --> 56:04.572
Hey, Frankie, do you miss your ball?

56:04.656 --> 56:08.451
Not at all. I've wasted so much of my life
with that stupid ball.

56:08.535 --> 56:12.539
You wasted your life? I played baseball.
And I'm a chicken.

56:12.622 --> 56:14.416
I gotta level with you, Henrietta.

56:15.000 --> 56:17.002
It could have been a lot worse for you.

56:17.085 --> 56:21.256
Look at me! I'm hopping! On my own feet!

56:21.339 --> 56:22.340
Whee!

56:22.424 --> 56:24.968
We're free! This is our new home.

56:25.051 --> 56:27.429
We can go where we want, do what we wa...

56:28.680 --> 56:29.681
Wha...

56:42.569 --> 56:44.195
What happens now, Ivan?

57:05.050 --> 57:06.051
What?

57:09.763 --> 57:13.058
Guys, go! Everybody hide. Everybody!

57:13.141 --> 57:14.809
I wanna stay with you, Ivan.

57:14.893 --> 57:17.604
I knew this was too good to be true.

57:17.687 --> 57:20.440
Whoa, whoa. Ivan, it's me! It's me.

57:21.066 --> 57:22.192
It's only me.

57:26.237 --> 57:27.989
What're you doin' out here, kid?

57:32.118 --> 57:35.080
Look. Ivan, you can't be out here. It's...

57:35.163 --> 57:37.874
All right, all right. All right.

57:46.257 --> 57:48.301
It's all under control.

57:52.847 --> 57:54.015
Come on, kid.

57:54.933 --> 57:57.143
We gotta get you back. All of you.

57:58.061 --> 57:59.813
You're not safe out here.

58:00.730 --> 58:02.273
Ruby is at risk.

58:03.692 --> 58:05.235
Is that what you want?

58:07.612 --> 58:09.572
We're in this together, Ivan.

58:11.449 --> 58:13.076
We're family.

58:15.120 --> 58:17.706
Come on. Let's go home.

58:36.474 --> 58:37.976
- Hey, Mack.
- Hey.

58:38.059 --> 58:39.686
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

58:39.769 --> 58:41.521
Hey, thanks for coming in early.

58:41.604 --> 58:42.939
Yeah, of course.

58:44.065 --> 58:46.609
- Where's Castello?
- Gone. I fired him.

58:47.235 --> 58:48.236
Listen...

58:49.279 --> 58:51.948
no one can know about tonight.

58:52.032 --> 58:55.160
I mean, if the city ever finds out,

58:55.243 --> 58:58.455
they would shut us down in a heartbeat.

58:58.538 --> 59:01.458
No worries. Understood.

59:01.541 --> 59:02.542
All right.

59:03.293 --> 59:06.421
Hey, it's okay. Go ahead.

59:07.339 --> 59:09.841
- Good job getting them all back.
- Thanks, George.

59:23.980 --> 59:24.981
Ivan?

59:27.067 --> 59:29.778
Will you tell me about a real forest?

59:30.320 --> 59:31.946
Ruby, listen to me.

59:32.030 --> 59:34.449
I'm sorry I couldn't keep my promise.

59:34.532 --> 59:37.702
But what is the wild like, Ivan?
Will you tell me?

59:38.453 --> 59:40.455
You know I can't remember
that kind of stuff.

59:40.538 --> 59:43.917
- But I've never even seen it.
- Ruby, I told you I can't remember.

59:44.000 --> 59:46.836
I don't... I can't remember the wild.

59:47.337 --> 59:48.713
Stella used to say...

59:49.881 --> 59:54.302
"There's a difference between
'can't remember' and 'won't remember.'"

59:59.557 --> 1:00:00.809
Please?

1:00:03.186 --> 1:00:04.396
Okay, I'll tell...

1:00:06.064 --> 1:00:08.650
I'll try to remember. I'll try.

1:00:11.861 --> 1:00:14.489
I remember my... my parents.

1:00:14.572 --> 1:00:18.159
They called me... they called me Mud.

1:00:18.576 --> 1:00:20.495
- "Mud"?
- Yeah.

1:00:20.578 --> 1:00:22.914
It's better than Bob.

1:00:23.415 --> 1:00:27.085
'Cause I was always wandering away
from the troop in search of it.

1:00:34.050 --> 1:00:38.763
I would use mud
to draw on anything I could find.

1:00:40.765 --> 1:00:43.393
I would get lost in a world of my own.

1:00:45.437 --> 1:00:49.482
While other gorillas were learning
to swing from vines and gather fruit,

1:00:49.566 --> 1:00:51.401
I was always down on the ground,

1:00:51.484 --> 1:00:54.070
in the mud... drawing.

1:00:55.196 --> 1:00:56.614
I could draw all day.

1:00:59.034 --> 1:01:01.244
My father thought
that was a little strange,

1:01:01.327 --> 1:01:04.748
so he tried to teach me
how to be strong and fearsome.

1:01:06.875 --> 1:01:09.544
This did not come naturally to me.

1:01:10.462 --> 1:01:12.047
I was a work in progress.

1:01:14.799 --> 1:01:16.676
But my dad still loved me.

1:01:18.595 --> 1:01:23.433
The only thing I loved as much as drawing
was playing with my sister, Tag.

1:01:24.934 --> 1:01:26.644
My parents called her Tag.

1:01:26.728 --> 1:01:29.064
That was the game she loved to play.

1:01:29.147 --> 1:01:30.523
She was good at tag.

1:01:31.066 --> 1:01:32.692
She'd always win.

1:01:36.404 --> 1:01:38.156
Tag sounds like fun.

1:01:38.823 --> 1:01:40.241
Where's your sister now?

1:01:45.663 --> 1:01:48.750
I don't think you want
to know all this, Ruby.

1:01:49.250 --> 1:01:50.752
Yes, I do.

1:01:53.129 --> 1:01:54.255
Well...

1:01:55.799 --> 1:01:58.677
it's a little foggy, but, um...

1:02:01.471 --> 1:02:04.724
One day, I was drawing in the mud.

1:02:05.600 --> 1:02:07.310
My dad watching over me.

1:02:08.478 --> 1:02:10.855
All of a sudden, it became very quiet.

1:02:14.275 --> 1:02:16.277
We heard strange noises.

1:02:20.657 --> 1:02:22.200
That's when they came.

1:02:23.785 --> 1:02:27.205
My dad threw me on his back, and we ran.

1:02:28.373 --> 1:02:30.291
Faster than he'd ever run before.

1:02:32.544 --> 1:02:35.547
My father and I,
we got separated from the others.

1:02:37.716 --> 1:02:40.719
He did everything he could to protect me.

1:02:40.802 --> 1:02:44.848
He placed me out of harm's reach,
high up in a tree.

1:02:47.809 --> 1:02:48.852
And then...

1:03:06.077 --> 1:03:08.496
I never saw anyone in my troop again.

1:03:11.041 --> 1:03:12.500
Julia gave me this.

1:03:13.126 --> 1:03:17.922
I named it "Not-Tag"
because it'll never be Tag.

1:03:22.010 --> 1:03:26.514
I used to think, i-if I'd learned
how to fight like my father...

1:03:27.432 --> 1:03:29.768
and I hadn't always been drawing
in the mud...

1:03:31.353 --> 1:03:33.355
I coulda...

1:03:35.982 --> 1:03:39.110
Humans are the worst.

1:03:39.194 --> 1:03:41.738
Cockroaches have bigger hearts.

1:03:41.821 --> 1:03:43.740
"Not all humans are bad."

1:03:43.823 --> 1:03:48.161
Remember what Stella said,
"Humans can surprise you."

1:03:49.079 --> 1:03:52.332
I bet your father loved you
for who you are, Ivan.

1:03:53.041 --> 1:03:56.586
I bet he loved your drawings, like I do.

1:03:59.297 --> 1:04:02.342
Thanks for the story, Ivan. Good night.

1:04:02.425 --> 1:04:04.010
Good night, Ruby.

1:04:04.094 --> 1:04:05.220
Good night, Bob.

1:04:07.889 --> 1:04:10.100
Now they're all calling me Bob.

1:04:23.154 --> 1:04:25.824
Hey, it was fun while it lasted.

1:04:25.907 --> 1:04:28.410
And look, you got a new truck.

1:04:28.493 --> 1:04:31.871
Yeah, but who drives a yellow fire truck?

1:04:31.955 --> 1:04:35.083
Sorry I left you, ball.
Don't be mad at me.

1:04:36.167 --> 1:04:37.168
Here we go.

1:04:38.211 --> 1:04:40.588
Take your time. Take your time.

1:04:40.672 --> 1:04:42.424
All four. That's it.

1:04:43.091 --> 1:04:45.010
Beautiful.

1:04:45.093 --> 1:04:46.845
That's my girl.

1:04:46.928 --> 1:04:50.557
Let's just go for a little stroll?
Here we go, sweetheart.

1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:51.725
Hey, Ivan.

1:04:53.685 --> 1:04:55.061
These are for you.

1:04:55.770 --> 1:04:59.733
They were a present from my aunt,
but I'm kinda too old for finger paints.

1:05:00.233 --> 1:05:02.694
All you gotta do is put your finger in...

1:05:04.029 --> 1:05:05.905
Well, you'll figure it out.

1:05:11.870 --> 1:05:13.872
I heard about last night.

1:05:15.165 --> 1:05:17.542
You don't wanna be here anymore, do you?

1:05:21.880 --> 1:05:24.007
I wish I could help you, Ivan.

1:05:24.090 --> 1:05:26.301
Just like I wish I could help my mom.

1:05:27.135 --> 1:05:29.012
Why are things stuck in cages?

1:05:30.764 --> 1:05:32.682
Why do people have to be sick?

1:05:34.976 --> 1:05:36.394
That's why I like drawing.

1:05:37.312 --> 1:05:40.774
I can draw things the way I want it to be,
and it's almost like...

1:05:40.857 --> 1:05:43.818
if I draw it well enough, it'll come true.

1:05:52.994 --> 1:05:54.204
This is my mom.

1:05:56.998 --> 1:05:59.417
This isn't what she looks like right now.

1:05:59.918 --> 1:06:01.711
One day she'll look like this again.

1:06:06.257 --> 1:06:07.842
You're a real artist, Ivan.

1:06:09.552 --> 1:06:10.887
I know you understand.

1:06:59.686 --> 1:07:01.271
Ivan, what are you doing?

1:07:01.354 --> 1:07:03.648
Can't talk. Can't talk. Too much to do.

1:07:47.650 --> 1:07:50.278
- Where is Ivan?
- He's up there.

1:07:59.204 --> 1:08:03.291
Today is gonna be a good one, Snickers.

1:08:23.186 --> 1:08:26.106
Well, hello there. Just in time.
Standing room, right over here.

1:08:26.189 --> 1:08:28.650
- That must be him. Mack?
- Yes?

1:08:28.733 --> 1:08:29.943
Hi.

1:08:30.026 --> 1:08:32.362
- Candace Taylor, WNMZ.
- Hello.

1:08:32.445 --> 1:08:34.781
I would love to ask you a few questions,
if you don't mind.

1:08:34.864 --> 1:08:37.283
Is it about our Picasso Primate, no doubt?

1:08:37.367 --> 1:08:40.954
Can you confirm reports
there was an escape here the other night?

1:08:41.371 --> 1:08:42.372
An escape?

1:08:42.455 --> 1:08:45.000
We have people claiming they saw animals
on the highway.

1:08:45.083 --> 1:08:46.376
- My.
- A gorilla.

1:08:46.459 --> 1:08:50.046
Well, that would be quite a sight to see
a gorilla on the highway, wouldn't it?

1:08:50.130 --> 1:08:54.259
No, I can assure you that all the animals
are right here, safe and sound.

1:08:54.342 --> 1:08:57.887
And actually, we're about to start
another fabulous show right now.

1:08:57.971 --> 1:09:02.517
So, listen, why don't you stick around?
And feel free to film our show.

1:09:02.600 --> 1:09:04.185
Ta-ta.

1:09:04.936 --> 1:09:07.105
Always use both hands with the light,
okay?

1:09:07.188 --> 1:09:09.108
- And remember to wait for me...
- I've got this.

1:09:09.190 --> 1:09:10.984
I've watched the show more than anyone.

1:09:11.067 --> 1:09:12.068
George, George.

1:09:12.152 --> 1:09:14.070
Listen, there is a reporter out there,

1:09:14.154 --> 1:09:17.073
and she's asking a lot of questions
about the animals escaping.

1:09:17.157 --> 1:09:20.035
- If she finds out, I'm done.
- I understand. You got it, Mack.

1:09:20.618 --> 1:09:23.830
Hey, Jules, thanks a lot for helping us
out with the show. Good luck!

1:09:23.913 --> 1:09:25.206
Break a leg, Mack.

1:09:26.833 --> 1:09:28.752
Frankie the seal!

1:09:34.007 --> 1:09:35.717
Let's play catch, Frankie.

1:09:35.800 --> 1:09:37.385
Up!

1:09:39.929 --> 1:09:43.266
Is Ivan okay?
It's almost time for him to go on.

1:09:43.350 --> 1:09:44.476
I'll go check.

1:09:46.269 --> 1:09:48.313
Frankie, what do you say...

1:09:48.396 --> 1:09:50.440
Shouldn't you be warming up?

1:09:54.694 --> 1:09:58.323
Ladies and gentlemen, Ruby!

1:09:59.908 --> 1:10:02.202
And up you go, girl!

1:10:09.793 --> 1:10:10.877
And now...

1:10:11.795 --> 1:10:14.506
the moment you've all been waiting for.

1:10:14.589 --> 1:10:17.634
The Primate Picasso himself!

1:10:18.259 --> 1:10:20.512
The one and only Ivan!

1:10:57.841 --> 1:11:01.302
Well, he's quite the artist,
isn't he, folks?

1:11:04.806 --> 1:11:06.808
Yes. Yes!

1:11:46.931 --> 1:11:47.932
Excuse me.

1:11:51.102 --> 1:11:53.104
- Dad, do you see it?
- Yeah.

1:11:53.188 --> 1:11:56.358
His painting's amazing.
And he did it with your finger paints?

1:11:56.441 --> 1:11:57.484
No, not that.

1:11:58.026 --> 1:11:59.903
It's how he wants things to be.

1:12:00.695 --> 1:12:02.322
Ivan wants to be in the wild.

1:12:03.865 --> 1:12:05.992
- What?
- Ivan doesn't wanna be here anymore.

1:12:06.076 --> 1:12:08.828
I know it. We have to do something.

1:12:08.912 --> 1:12:13.333
Julia, even if that's true, I don't know
what we can do about that, sweetheart.

1:12:13.416 --> 1:12:14.417
I know.

1:12:15.001 --> 1:12:16.336
She can help him.

1:12:24.010 --> 1:12:26.721
Julia, this is my job. Okay?

1:12:26.805 --> 1:12:29.224
- We can't just...
- Dad, please!

1:12:29.307 --> 1:12:31.101
Ivan needs to be free.

1:12:32.227 --> 1:12:35.146
Don't you always say
we should try to do the right thing?

1:12:37.023 --> 1:12:39.067
Who's next? What would you like?

1:12:41.444 --> 1:12:45.907
There you are. What would you like?
One and two...

1:12:56.376 --> 1:12:57.377
Go.

1:13:02.215 --> 1:13:05.593
Excuse me. Hi. I'm Julia.

1:13:06.219 --> 1:13:07.637
Hi, Julia.

1:13:07.721 --> 1:13:09.097
What can I do for you?

1:13:16.938 --> 1:13:19.774
Ivan, what's that noise?

1:13:21.026 --> 1:13:24.863
Free Ivan! Ruby!
Free Ivan! Ruby! Free Ivan!

1:13:24.946 --> 1:13:26.364
What's happening?

1:13:27.824 --> 1:13:29.200
Free Ivan! Ruby!

1:13:29.284 --> 1:13:33.204
As you can see, I'm now standing
in front of the Big Top Mall.

1:13:33.288 --> 1:13:35.707
Remember Ivan?
The gorilla that likes to draw?

1:13:35.790 --> 1:13:39.502
Well, his painting is clearly a sign
he wants to be free.

1:13:39.586 --> 1:13:44.549
Free Ivan! Ruby! Free Ivan! Ruby!
Free Ivan! Ruby!

1:14:05.070 --> 1:14:06.529
You did it, buddy.

1:14:07.072 --> 1:14:09.824
Ivan, why are they yelling our names?

1:14:09.908 --> 1:14:11.618
Are they mad at us?

1:14:12.118 --> 1:14:15.455
No, Ruby. They're not mad at us.

1:14:15.538 --> 1:14:17.082
They wanna help us.

1:14:17.832 --> 1:14:20.168
They want us to be free.

1:14:26.174 --> 1:14:30.720
Remember, Stella knew there was
something better out there for us.

1:14:31.471 --> 1:14:33.348
She couldn't get there herself,

1:14:34.099 --> 1:14:36.351
but she wanted to make sure
that you would.

1:14:37.143 --> 1:14:39.813
I don't wanna go anywhere without you.

1:14:39.896 --> 1:14:43.233
Well, you know,
change is scary for all of us.

1:14:43.316 --> 1:14:46.945
Sometimes you just have to
take a leap of faith, Ruby.

1:14:48.196 --> 1:14:51.616
Trust that kindness will always be there
when you need it.

1:14:53.076 --> 1:14:54.786
"Not all humans are bad.

1:14:56.955 --> 1:14:58.540
They can surprise you."

1:14:59.624 --> 1:15:01.209
Remember?

1:15:01.292 --> 1:15:03.003
I remember.

1:15:06.756 --> 1:15:08.466
Mind your backs!

1:15:08.550 --> 1:15:09.551
All right.

1:15:11.011 --> 1:15:14.139
So long, Frankie.
Let me see that gorgeous smile.

1:15:14.222 --> 1:15:16.266
Keep in touch.

1:15:16.349 --> 1:15:18.351
Ain't nobody loves you better.

1:15:20.937 --> 1:15:25.150
- Do you think there'll be other elephants?
- Yeah. I'm sure there will be.

1:15:25.233 --> 1:15:26.901
Will they like me?

1:15:26.985 --> 1:15:29.738
Yeah, of course they'll like you. You bet.

1:15:29.821 --> 1:15:32.574
You can tell 'em the refrigerator joke.
They'll love that.

1:15:32.657 --> 1:15:34.617
Footprints in the butter!

1:15:34.701 --> 1:15:36.995
Exactly. Works every time.

1:15:37.078 --> 1:15:38.705
I'll tell them about you, Ivan.

1:15:38.788 --> 1:15:41.082
And Bob and Julia

1:15:41.166 --> 1:15:43.501
and Henrietta and Murphy

1:15:43.585 --> 1:15:45.754
and Frankie and Thelma...

1:15:48.923 --> 1:15:50.300
and Stella.

1:15:51.551 --> 1:15:52.844
Yeah.

1:15:52.927 --> 1:15:55.221
You be sure to tell 'em about Stella.

1:15:56.181 --> 1:15:57.182
I will.

1:16:01.978 --> 1:16:03.438
Hey, Ruby.

1:16:03.521 --> 1:16:05.231
I'm Dr. Maya.

1:16:05.940 --> 1:16:07.317
Now, you come with me.

1:16:21.790 --> 1:16:22.999
There you go.

1:16:29.214 --> 1:16:30.840
Goodbye, Ivan.

1:16:31.925 --> 1:16:33.593
Goodbye, Ruby.

1:16:44.062 --> 1:16:47.107
It's gonna be just you and me now,
Snickers.

1:16:53.613 --> 1:16:54.698
Hey, pal.

1:16:55.448 --> 1:16:57.158
Don't get too comfortable.

1:16:58.159 --> 1:17:00.704
I guess all good things come to an end.

1:17:00.787 --> 1:17:01.788
Yeah.

1:17:02.956 --> 1:17:06.501
How am I gonna fall asleep
without that warm tummy of yours?

1:17:06.584 --> 1:17:09.004
You can sneak in there, with me.

1:17:09.796 --> 1:17:12.257
Humans are dumb, but they ain't that dumb.

1:17:13.925 --> 1:17:17.095
You'll be all right.
You're a wild beast, remember?

1:17:18.221 --> 1:17:21.141
Well, technically,
I'm a domesticated species.

1:17:21.224 --> 1:17:24.019
But I'll figure something out.
I always do.

1:17:26.104 --> 1:17:27.105
Here.

1:17:28.398 --> 1:17:29.441
What's this for?

1:17:30.066 --> 1:17:31.526
That's to help you sleep.

1:17:34.571 --> 1:17:35.572
Aw.

1:17:37.699 --> 1:17:38.783
Thanks.

1:17:41.661 --> 1:17:45.123
Well, I'd better get outta here
before they cart me off to the pound.

1:17:53.423 --> 1:17:55.633
You're the one and only Ivan, pal.

1:17:56.760 --> 1:17:57.761
Remember that.

1:17:58.386 --> 1:17:59.387
Yeah.

1:18:02.223 --> 1:18:03.850
And you're the one and only...

1:18:05.435 --> 1:18:08.021
Bob.

1:18:08.104 --> 1:18:09.814
Everyone needs a name.

1:18:10.648 --> 1:18:12.484
I guess mine's Bob.

1:18:15.236 --> 1:18:17.655
No, no, no. Don't worry, dog.

1:18:20.033 --> 1:18:21.034
You're okay.

1:18:50.480 --> 1:18:52.315
We had some laughs, kid?

1:19:07.789 --> 1:19:08.790
Remember that?

1:19:11.334 --> 1:19:13.044
The day I brought you home.

1:19:17.924 --> 1:19:19.467
Best times of my life.

1:19:56.921 --> 1:19:57.922
Well...

1:20:00.592 --> 1:20:01.885
good luck, kid.

1:20:25.200 --> 1:20:27.494
I'm gonna miss you, Ivan.

1:20:49.724 --> 1:20:50.850
Go on, Ivan.

1:20:52.018 --> 1:20:53.311
It's time.

1:21:05.281 --> 1:21:06.491
Go on.

1:22:07.844 --> 1:22:08.928
Ivan!

1:22:09.512 --> 1:22:13.683
You're okay. This isn't your home.

1:22:13.767 --> 1:22:16.686
This is.

1:24:41.706 --> 1:24:43.458
She's here, Stella.

1:24:45.043 --> 1:24:47.170
She's free.

1:27:49.853 --> 1:27:52.355
Nice digs you got here.

1:27:52.439 --> 1:27:53.732
Bob?

1:27:54.190 --> 1:27:56.651
Hi, pal! Long time no see.

1:27:57.360 --> 1:27:59.571
How'd you get in here?

1:27:59.654 --> 1:28:01.573
Are you kidding? I can sneak in anywhere.

1:28:01.656 --> 1:28:02.657
Ivan!

1:28:02.991 --> 1:28:04.242
Here she is.

1:28:04.325 --> 1:28:05.326
Ivan!

1:28:05.785 --> 1:28:07.037
- Julia?
- Yeah.

1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:10.290
Turns out her mom likes having me around.
Who could blame her?

1:28:10.373 --> 1:28:14.085
So, I live with them as, well,
as kind of a favor, you know?

1:28:14.169 --> 1:28:15.712
Just to keep everyone happy.

1:28:16.379 --> 1:28:18.340
- Really?
- Ivan.

1:28:19.466 --> 1:28:22.052
We've missed you. You look great!

1:28:25.055 --> 1:28:27.265
Dad, doesn't he look so happy?

1:28:27.349 --> 1:28:28.475
He sure does.

1:28:29.267 --> 1:28:32.187
Uncle Mack, he looks great, doesn't he?

1:28:33.980 --> 1:28:35.106
He really does.

1:28:36.483 --> 1:28:38.068
See?

1:28:38.151 --> 1:28:41.112
You drew it so well,
you made it come true.

1:28:41.571 --> 1:28:42.947
I'm so proud of you.

1:28:45.241 --> 1:28:46.826
Never forget, pal,

1:28:47.535 --> 1:28:49.621
you're the one and only Ivan.

1:28:54.876 --> 1:28:58.254
That's me. Mighty silverback.
