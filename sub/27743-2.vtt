Do your parents know where you are?

03:32.712 --> 03:34.672
I don't even know where I am.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.049
What is this place?

03:36.633 --> 03:41.179
An archaeological dig site,
where we search for links to our past.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.598
You mean, like, dinosaur bones?

03:43.890 --> 03:45.475
Anything historic.

03:45.808 --> 03:47.435
If you've been following the news,

you'll know that
we just discovered a relic here

03:49.687 --> 03:51.814

My crew identified it just days ago

03:57.695 --> 04:00.865

at this very moment.

04:01.324 --> 04:03.368
And you're not worried
about them stealing it?

04:03.910 --> 04:06.037
Now, why ever would they do that?

04:06.579 --> 04:10.333
My crew is well aware that a treasure
such as this belongs in a museum.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.753
Treasure? As in, worth a fortune?

04:14.295 --> 04:18.675
Some things possess value
other than monetary, young lady.

04:18.758 --> 04:22.470
Any historic find such as this gem
belongs to everyone.

04:23.221 --> 04:26.266
Its theft would rob the world
of knowledge,

04:26.557 --> 04:29.227
and that would be a true crime.

04:31.479 --> 04:34.065

Uh, well, yes and no. It's complicated.

06:48.282 --> 06:51.410

like the big brother I never had, Gray.

06:54.080 --> 06:55.039
[train horn honks]

06:55.456 --> 06:56.958
Until that moment.

06:58.167 --> 07:01.963
What can I say?
Graduation was a game-changer.

07:04.674 --> 07:05.842
[Dr. Bellum] Graduates...

07:06.801 --> 07:10.638
you did not make it this far
on your grades alone.

07:11.305 --> 07:15.435
We have been profiling you all along
to test your allegiance

07:15.518 --> 07:20.606
as well as your willingness
to go to any necessary extremes.

07:21.065 --> 07:27.155
No one or thing must stand
in the way of achieving our goals.

07:27.572 --> 07:30.950
You've earned your place
at our elite table.

07:31.617 --> 07:34.704
Now hear the true name of VILE:

07:35.121 --> 07:40.168

League of Evil. [echoes]

Evil.

07:47.300 --> 07:50.011
[scoffs] My entire upbringing was a lie.

07:50.470 --> 07:53.764
Stealing isn't a game.
It does harm people.

07:54.265 --> 07:56.476
Especially when you're willing
to steal lives.

08:04.525 --> 08:06.486

What is it now, Ms. Argent? I am driving!

08:16.496 --> 08:18.956
Inspector Devineaux,
the purported crime scene

08:19.040 --> 08:21.792

with stolen goods of all kinds.

08:21.876 --> 08:23.586
Cash, bonds, art.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.046
What?

08:25.129 --> 08:27.632
Was the apartment owner
not the robbery victim?

08:27.715 --> 08:30.676
<i>That's what I said.</i>
<i>So I did some fact-checking.</i>

08:30.843 --> 08:35.723
The owner on record isn't an individual,
but an import-export company.

08:35.806 --> 08:37.725
But even more intriguing,

08:37.808 --> 08:40.436
the places Carmen Sandiego
recently robbed,

08:40.520 --> 08:44.690
the Swiss Bank, the art gallery in Cairo,
the Shanghai amusement park,

08:44.774 --> 08:47.068
all have ties to the same company.

08:47.318 --> 08:50.279
Ms. Argent,
what is it you are trying to say?

08:50.571 --> 08:53.491
Well, what if, for whatever reason,

08:53.574 --> 08:59.622
Carmen Sandiego were a thief
who only steals from other thieves?

08:59.705 --> 09:01.040

09:25.356 --> 09:28.025
[Gray] Our journey's winding to a close.

09:28.693 --> 09:32.405
And I'm not any closer to knowing
the story behind your chic new look

09:32.822 --> 09:34.407
or your name.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.200
[weapon charging]

It confounds me that a device registered
to our mainland bookkeeping department

11:23.599 --> 11:26.685
ever wound up in Black Sheep's
possession to begin with.

11:27.228 --> 11:29.105
It confounds me that Black Sheep

15:24.715 --> 15:26.967
Yes, I have.

15:27.301 --> 15:31.513
Um, and with age comes maturity,

15:32.264 --> 15:34.433
which is why I was so anxious
to catch you, Ms. Booker,

15:34.516 --> 15:37.227
so we could talk somewhere private.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.856
I-- I just wanted you to know
how super ashamed I am

15:41.148 --> 15:44.318
of all the really dumb pranks
I've pulled on you over the years.

15:44.944 --> 15:45.778
I apologize.

15:46.487 --> 15:49.573
I wondered about the absence
of a water balloon attack tonight.

15:49.990 --> 15:52.409
First time in quite a few years.

15:56.121 --> 15:58.123
I'll blame your unusual upbringing.

15:58.582 --> 16:03.629
One can't be expected to behave honorably
when raised among thieves, after all.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.673
Shake on it, Ms. Booker?

16:06.715 --> 16:08.008
Call me "Cookie."

16:09.593 --> 16:10.636
[elevator dings]

16:13.472 --> 16:16.016
Young lady, you seem like a smart cookie.

16:16.809 --> 16:19.269
If you wish to walk in my shoes someday,

16:19.353 --> 16:23.399
set your sights higher
than pulling pranks or picking pockets.

16:23.607 --> 16:27.027
White-collar crime
is where the real money is.

16:27.361 --> 16:30.489
Thank you for the career advice.
I will take it to heart.

16:32.032 --> 16:34.284

16:45.254 --> 16:46.088
Huh?

16:46.505 --> 16:48.173
Whatever can the problem...?

16:50.300 --> 16:51.385
Bait and switch!

16:51.760 --> 16:52.594
[alarm blaring]

16:55.764 --> 16:57.141
Code red. They're onto me.

16:57.474 --> 16:59.226
Player? Hello?

16:59.810 --> 17:01.478
[groans] Signals are jammed.

17:02.688 --> 17:05.649
Dr. Bellum, care to pinpoint
the origin of the code red?

17:06.150 --> 17:07.609
The server room.

17:08.318 --> 17:11.321
[Carmen panting]

17:12.531 --> 17:13.782
My ride should still be waiting.

17:19.580 --> 17:22.875
[grunts, groans]

17:28.964 --> 17:30.049
No!

17:30.424 --> 17:31.550
No!

17:33.135 --> 17:34.178
[sighs]

17:38.432 --> 17:41.143
It's past curfew.
All students are in their bunks.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.020
Except for...

17:45.105 --> 17:46.356
Black Sheep.

17:46.982 --> 17:48.901
The girl must be punished.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.087
Ugh. Hall monitors.

18:11.590 --> 18:16.804
Gunnar, the child is certainly a menace,
but placing the entire island on lockdown?

18:17.012 --> 18:19.640
The "child" may have compromised
VILE's income

18:19.723 --> 18:22.434
for the entire coming year, thanks to you.

18:22.851 --> 18:25.145
We must retrieve that drive!

18:25.562 --> 18:27.147
Well, it's out of my hands now,

18:27.231 --> 18:30.692
so please provide me
with clearance to leave.

18:31.276 --> 18:33.070
Fine. Good riddance.

18:33.153 --> 18:36.323
Thank you very much.
I'll just collect my coat and be off.

18:42.746 --> 18:43.747
Whoa.

[Captain groans]

20:27.434 --> 20:29.645
She will never outrace us by boat.

20:30.229 --> 20:31.396
Pity.

20:32.147 --> 20:34.316
[engine stalling]

20:37.861 --> 20:39.613
[Boris] She does not miss a trick.

Hmm.

I need to know where on Earth I am.

21:47.222 --> 21:49.016

21:50.475 --> 21:51.476
The Canary Islands.

21:51.977 --> 21:54.938
A Spanish settlement
just off the coast of Western Africa.

21:55.689 --> 21:57.399
It was an interesting place to grow up,

21:57.607 --> 21:59.609
but it's time to see
the rest of the world.

22:00.068 --> 22:02.821
No more bookkeepers, and no more VILE.

It's... Carmen.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.127
Carmen Sandiego.

22:18.045 --> 22:20.047
Now, about this whole "white hat" thing.

22:21.131 --> 22:22.299
Does it have to be white?

22:27.763 --> 22:28.805
[Gray] End of the line.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.016
We miss you, Black Sheep.

22:31.933 --> 22:33.602
VILE wants a truce.

22:33.685 --> 22:36.521
They want me stealing for them
instead of from them.

22:37.022 --> 22:38.315
You've proven yourself.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.358
It's all you ever wanted, isn't it?

22:47.574 --> 22:48.533
Aha!

22:48.950 --> 22:51.286
The league's offering you a full pardon.

22:51.369 --> 22:53.080
Even Shadowsan's on board.

22:53.163 --> 22:56.875
They'll make things right
if you just come home, where you belong.

22:58.668 --> 23:01.379
I was hoping we'd end up
on the same side again tonight, Gray.

23:04.299 --> 23:05.383
My side.

23:06.259 --> 23:07.344

Still in a league of your own.

23:13.975 --> 23:15.769
Bye-bye, Black Sheep.

You weren't listening. I go by Carmen now.

Nothing you don't already know.

[cell phone ringing]

24:15.537 --> 24:17.247
Yes? What is it?

24:17.330 --> 24:21.084
Inspector Devineaux,
we turned up something rather astonishing.

24:21.168 --> 24:24.880
I believe it's the Eye of Vishnu
from the unsolved Morocco heist.

24:25.380 --> 24:27.299
We found it between the couch cushions.

24:27.382 --> 24:29.176
-Almost as if--
-<i>Let me guess!</i>

24:29.259 --> 24:33.722
Almost as if Carmen Sandiego
wanted us to find it. [scoffs]

24:34.097 --> 24:36.975
If our thief indeed
left such a treasure behind,

24:37.058 --> 24:40.562
she must have gotten away
with something truly priceless!

24:42.355 --> 24:45.358
[Player] <i>Wait, seriously?</i>
<i>You didn't take the gemstone?</i>

24:45.567 --> 24:46.526
Total win-win.

24:46.610 --> 24:48.820
I knew Interpol would get it back
where it belonged,

24:49.404 --> 24:52.741
which left my hands free
to take the real treasure:

24:53.325 --> 24:55.452
my oldest traveling companions.

24:56.036 --> 25:00.248
Like an archeology find,
the only link I have to my past.

25:01.499 --> 25:03.877
I have Gray to thank
for using them to bait me.

25:07.631 --> 25:09.883
Now, did you wire the proceeds
from the Shanghai job

25:09.966 --> 25:11.468
to the next non-profits on my list?

25:11.551 --> 25:13.762
<i>Food bank, homeless shelter, orphanage.</i>

25:13.845 --> 25:14.763
Check.

25:14.846 --> 25:16.848
I even had time to decrypt the next entry.

25:17.515 --> 25:19.351
Another secret VILE hideout,

25:19.851 --> 25:22.938
located in Southeast Asia
on the island of Java.
