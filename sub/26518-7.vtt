WEBVTT

00:05.962 --> 00:08.834
What the hell are you thinking,
calling this number?

00:08.878 --> 00:10.662
Some guy was snooping
around the warehouse.
Who?

00:10.706 --> 00:12.925
I don't know, but he had Fed
written all over him.

00:12.969 --> 00:15.450
I'LL send you coordinates.
Wait for me there.

00:20.890 --> 00:22.805
I just went to the warehouse.

00:25.199 --> 00:28.071
Your friend Violet,
she just tried to kill me.

00:28.115 --> 00:31.422
What

00:31.466 --> 00:34.077
No, I'm not.

00:34.121 --> 00:36.079
What the hell
is going on, Jane?

00:36.123 --> 00:39.082
I'm so sorry
I put you in danger.

00:39.126 --> 00:42.216
I didn't want that, but you
shouldn't have followed me.

00:42.259 --> 00:44.087
You're saying
this is my fault?

00:44.131 --> 00:47.264
You said that that woman
was helping you find a cure.

00:47.308 --> 00:50.224
It's not true, is it?
No.

00:50.267 --> 00:52.139
That woman, Violet Park,

00:52.182 --> 00:56.099
she's the Sandstorm operative
Dolan was talking to.

00:56.143 --> 00:57.361
So you ran an investigation
on your own?

00:57.405 --> 00:58.754
I didn't want to spook her.

00:58.797 --> 01:00.147
So is that
why you lied to me?

01:00.190 --> 01:01.365
Any backup would have
given me away.

01:01.409 --> 01:05.108
Wow. I don't know
what's worse--

01:05.152 --> 01:07.023
the fact that
you're still lying to me

01:07.067 --> 01:09.286
or that you still think
that I'll ever believe you.

01:09.330 --> 01:11.288
You've never trusted me.

01:11.332 --> 01:13.116
That's why you
followed me around

01:13.160 --> 01:14.335
instead of having
a conversation.

01:14.378 --> 01:16.163
That is all I've been
trying to do, Jane.

01:16.206 --> 01:17.816
You know,
I feel sorry for you.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.383
Finding out
your dad was a killer

01:19.427 --> 01:23.170
made it impossible
for you to trust anyone,

01:23.213 --> 01:25.172
even your own wife.

01:25.215 --> 01:27.130
Hello? I need some help!

01:27.174 --> 01:29.132
This is an emergency! Who's that?

01:29.176 --> 01:31.134
I don't know. Please, I hear you
in there.

01:31.178 --> 01:33.441
I really need some help. Get the door.

01:41.231 --> 01:45.844
Hi, I'm Wendy Stone's sister,
Lori. Do you guys know her?

01:45.888 --> 01:49.718
Yeah, she's from 203.I'm such an idiot.

01:49.761 --> 01:52.373
I was just taking out
the trash and I completely
locked myself out.

01:52.416 --> 01:55.376
Is it okay if I borrow
your phone to call her
and get the keys?

01:55.419 --> 01:57.595
Now's not the best time.

01:57.639 --> 02:00.381
I was just babysitting
my nephew and now he's
home all alone.

02:00.424 --> 02:02.165
He can't let you in?He's one.

02:03.471 --> 02:05.168
Okay, yeah, come in.

02:05.212 --> 02:06.865
Thank you. Thank you.

02:06.909 --> 02:09.085
I hope I'm not
interrupting anything.

02:09.129 --> 02:11.261
The phone's over there.Thank you.

02:18.442 --> 02:20.792
This is next gen stuff.
Where'd you get these?

02:20.836 --> 02:23.404
What kind of plane
is this for?

02:23.447 --> 02:24.840
Don't worry about that, Leo.

02:24.883 --> 02:28.191
Can you hack the
aeronautics system or not?

02:28.235 --> 02:31.412
Please.
I can own this thing.

02:31.455 --> 02:32.804
How are you so sure?

02:32.848 --> 02:36.678
Waldoballz.
It's an algorithm.

02:36.721 --> 02:39.202
I know. I didn't name it.
The guy who coded it did.

02:39.246 --> 02:40.638
I would have named it
something way cooler.

02:40.682 --> 02:41.987
And that guy would be?

02:42.031 --> 02:43.424
Goes by Del Toro.

02:43.467 --> 02:46.296
He used it to breach the
DOD firewall, a Russian sub.

02:46.340 --> 02:48.037
It can get in anywhere.

02:48.080 --> 02:50.648
And you have access
to Waldoballz?

02:50.692 --> 02:52.781
A beta version.
But I can re-code it

02:52.824 --> 02:54.652
to fit these specs
in my sleep.

02:54.696 --> 02:55.871
You're hired.

02:57.394 --> 03:00.267
Troy will set up
everything you need.

03:00.310 --> 03:02.269
Give Leo
the full treatment.

03:06.273 --> 03:08.231
Now that we have our hacker,
we need to work out

03:08.275 --> 03:10.102
the specifics
of this plane crash.

03:10.146 --> 03:11.930
We still don't know what
the aircraft is being used for

03:11.974 --> 03:14.150
or when the first
test flight is.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.239
We don't have our hacker.

03:16.283 --> 03:19.851
You just hired him.

03:19.895 --> 03:23.420
Yes, and now Troy
will dispose of him.

03:23.464 --> 03:25.292
Why?
Leo seemed confident.

03:25.335 --> 03:28.599
Why settle for a copycat
when we can get the real thing?

03:28.643 --> 03:31.298
His name was Del Toro,
wasn't it?
Yeah.

03:31.341 --> 03:33.517
He's a major player
on the dark web and he
can't be easy to get to.

03:33.561 --> 03:37.434
Maybe Leo could
track him down.
No. No.

03:37.478 --> 03:39.958
That's what I have you for.

03:44.572 --> 03:46.530
What do you like?
You like Indian?
You like Thai?

03:46.574 --> 03:48.619
Ooh, you know what?
I got a great empanada guy.

03:48.663 --> 03:50.447
You have an empanada guy?Mm-hmm.

03:50.491 --> 03:51.535
A guy who gets me
empanadas.

03:51.579 --> 03:54.451
I'm-- I'm good.
Not hungry?

03:54.495 --> 03:55.539
Not since you suspended me.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.280
Are we still talking
about that?

03:57.324 --> 03:59.151
You know the suspension
is temporary.

03:59.195 --> 04:01.850
Is it? Conducting an
off-the-books search for Zapata

04:01.893 --> 04:04.200
could ruin
both of our careers.As opposed to what?

04:04.244 --> 04:06.289
Do nothing?
Let the CIA find her first?

04:06.333 --> 04:08.639
If they get to Zapata,
they will bring her
back in a body bag.

04:08.683 --> 04:11.163
I know. I...

04:11.207 --> 04:13.340
I just want to make sure
we do this right.

04:13.383 --> 04:15.994
You don't trust me.How am I supposed to know

04:16.038 --> 04:17.692
you won't use this against me
later on down the road?

04:17.735 --> 04:21.522
Okay, look, relax.
I'm on your side, Ed.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.480
Can I call you Ed?
I'm gonna call you Ed.

04:23.524 --> 04:26.527
Listen, in order to
get to Zapata first,

04:26.570 --> 04:27.876
it's gonna take
a big, bold move,

04:27.919 --> 04:29.312
and I'm not
gonna sugarcoat it,

04:29.356 --> 04:32.010
you might get burned
for it, but the fact

04:32.054 --> 04:34.404
that I'm on your couch
right now insures that
if you go down,

04:34.448 --> 04:37.407
I go down with you.
We are in this together.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.237
So, pizza and wings?

04:42.847 --> 04:45.763
You know what? I may have
a way to get ahead of the CIA.

04:47.417 --> 04:49.245
All right. Yeah,
I like the sound of that.

04:49.289 --> 04:52.814
What do you got?A big, bold move.

04:57.471 --> 05:00.561
The following motion picture
is rated "R"

05:00.604 --> 05:03.259
for mild violence,
tasteful nudity,

05:03.303 --> 05:05.696
and, of course,
very mature themes.

05:05.740 --> 05:09.961
Please set your cellular
devices to vibrate.What is this?

05:10.005 --> 05:12.964
It's time to get serious
about The Book of Secrets.
Oh.

05:13.008 --> 05:15.576
Okay, so you made
a film about it.

05:15.619 --> 05:18.579
Well, if we're going
to try to find the cure
for what's ailing Jane,

05:18.622 --> 05:20.537
it's probably for
the best that we know
its entire history.

05:20.581 --> 05:22.452
Here you go.

05:25.629 --> 05:27.283
Wait, wait, hey,
hang on, hang on.

05:27.327 --> 05:29.024
Don't put them on until
it tells you to put them on.

05:29.067 --> 05:30.460
Okay.
Okay, put them on.

05:34.029 --> 05:37.554
From the dawn of civilization,

05:37.598 --> 05:40.514
mankind has asked,
"Why are we here?!"

05:40.557 --> 05:42.820
And, "Why does this hurt?"

05:42.864 --> 05:45.780
Also,
"Should this be leaking?"

05:45.823 --> 05:49.044
Scientists have worked
tirelessly to cure pain,

05:49.087 --> 05:51.742
disease and suffering
for millennia.

05:51.786 --> 05:56.312
But what if the key
to unlocking medicine's
most complex challenges

05:56.356 --> 05:59.228
lies in an ancient lost text?

05:59.271 --> 06:03.101
The Book of Secrets.

06:05.147 --> 06:07.802
Oh, my God, how could you not
want to find this thing?!

06:07.845 --> 06:12.023
But before we delve into this
tome of nature-based remedies,

06:12.067 --> 06:15.418
it is important to explore
where life began.

06:15.462 --> 06:18.682
Was it on land
or in the ocean?

06:18.726 --> 06:20.467
Oh, my God.

06:20.510 --> 06:21.990
Yeah, it's pretty cool,
right?

06:22.033 --> 06:24.209
Turtles.
What, no good?

06:24.253 --> 06:26.473
I was gonna go with
manatees. I should have
gone with manatees.

06:26.516 --> 06:30.433
No, no, no, no. I
think I know how to find
Roman's next data cache!

06:30.477 --> 06:32.783
Well, hang on.
The turtles are...
Hey, you can't...

06:32.827 --> 06:34.481
Don't stop it
in the middle.
Are you kidding me?

06:34.524 --> 06:36.091
I'm building up
to something.

06:36.134 --> 06:39.311
Jeez, you've never
seen "Westworld"? Rude.

06:39.355 --> 06:41.488
Okay, Wendy. Okay,
I'll see you soon.

06:42.619 --> 06:44.447
Thank you for letting me
use the phone.

06:44.491 --> 06:45.579
How can I return
the favor?

06:45.622 --> 06:46.928
It's not necessary.

06:46.971 --> 06:49.147
Ginger snaps.
I'll make ginger snaps.

06:49.191 --> 06:50.453
Aah!

07:11.779 --> 07:13.128
Stop!

07:13.171 --> 07:15.391
I lied.

07:15.435 --> 07:16.697
No ginger snaps.

07:24.705 --> 07:28.273
I gotta say, guys,
I am so excited

07:28.317 --> 07:31.538
to finally meet the two folks
who have ruined my life.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.148
Who the hell are you?

07:33.191 --> 07:35.846
You can call me Eve,
and I'm here to retrieve

07:35.890 --> 07:40.198
the money that you took
when the FBI raided my bank.

07:40.242 --> 07:42.113
You mean the underground bank

07:42.157 --> 07:43.854
used by criminals
and terrorists?

07:43.898 --> 07:46.727
You won't see a cent.
We've seized everything.

07:46.770 --> 07:49.120
I know, and I'm sure
the government's spent it

07:49.164 --> 07:51.340
a hundred different ways
by now, so, I mean,

07:51.383 --> 07:52.733
that 200 mil's
as good as gone,

07:52.776 --> 07:54.604
but that's actually
not why I'm here.

07:56.737 --> 07:59.783
I'm here for the 500,000
that you took.

08:04.614 --> 08:07.530
♪♪

08:18.585 --> 08:21.022
You can tell me where
my money is any time now,

08:21.065 --> 08:23.154
'cause you know this
is only gonna get worse for you.

08:23.198 --> 08:25.722
A lot of hands at the FBI
touched your money.

08:25.766 --> 08:27.637
Why in the hell do you
think I stole it?

08:27.681 --> 08:29.639
Oh, I've got
a pretty reliable source.

08:29.683 --> 08:31.162
Who's that?

08:31.206 --> 08:34.601
Meet my good friend,
hidden surveillance camera.

08:38.692 --> 08:43.261
Ooh, how awkward.
Hubby didn't know?

08:45.829 --> 08:48.049
Now that we're all
on the same page,

08:48.092 --> 08:49.311
where's my money?

08:51.661 --> 08:53.881
Fine.
Rip the place apart.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.494
It all makes
so much sense now,

08:58.538 --> 09:01.366
why you've been
acting so strange,

09:01.410 --> 09:02.585
why you've been
lying to me.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.805
Can we not do this
right now, Kurt?

09:04.848 --> 09:07.764
I've been researching the
ZIP drug and memory loss.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.723
You know, in some cases,
people revert back

09:09.766 --> 09:11.942
to an earlier version
of themselves,

09:11.986 --> 09:15.206
like a record needle
skipping back a few tracks.

09:15.250 --> 09:17.600
That usually happens
after a major trauma.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.605
No! Jane!

09:22.649 --> 09:24.781
Jane.

09:24.825 --> 09:26.827
Violet Park isn't
the Sandstorm operative

09:26.870 --> 09:28.219
we've been searching for,
is she?

09:29.481 --> 09:30.831
It's you.

09:30.874 --> 09:33.268
You're not Jane anymore.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.097
You're Remi.

09:43.365 --> 09:45.846
Where are we
with Del Toro?

09:45.889 --> 09:47.630
No one's ever been
able to link his hacks

09:47.674 --> 09:49.023
to an identity.

09:49.066 --> 09:50.851
Finding him
could take some time.

09:50.894 --> 09:52.635
We don't have it.

09:52.679 --> 09:54.637
Well, then maybe we
shouldn't crash this plane.

09:56.117 --> 09:58.249
HCI Global can win
a defense contract

09:58.293 --> 10:00.338
through other avenues,

10:00.382 --> 10:02.645
ones that don't hinge
on finding a ghost

10:02.689 --> 10:03.907
or leaving
a path of destruction

10:03.951 --> 10:05.648
that could trace
right back to us.

10:07.041 --> 10:09.086
When I first took
control of this company,

10:09.130 --> 10:10.697
I realized how big,

10:10.740 --> 10:13.830
how sprawling
a machine it is.

10:13.874 --> 10:16.354
Hank Crawford had it set
at auto-pilot.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.835
It was safe, it was slow.

10:18.879 --> 10:23.100
HCI Global was
withering on the vine.

10:23.144 --> 10:27.322
Now, from the ashes
of one plane crash,

10:27.365 --> 10:29.237
I can bring it back to life.

10:29.280 --> 10:30.891
Is it a risk? Yes.

10:30.934 --> 10:33.937
But, hell, taking risks
is what got me into that chair.

10:33.981 --> 10:36.679
Now, I want that hacker now.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.725
I have waited
30 years for this.

10:38.768 --> 10:41.162
I am done with waiting.For what?

10:41.205 --> 10:43.294
Power? You have it.

10:44.774 --> 10:46.558
Revenge.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.345
Yeah?

10:51.738 --> 10:53.348
Really?

10:53.391 --> 10:54.523
Well, send him in.

10:57.613 --> 10:59.876
We have
an unexpected visitor.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.399
You gotta leave.

11:09.190 --> 11:11.975
Miss Burke, so good
to see you again.

11:12.019 --> 11:14.369
The feeling is mutual,
Director Weitz.

11:14.412 --> 11:16.414
What brings you here
at this hour?

11:16.458 --> 11:19.069
Oh, well, I didn't want to
waltz into your office midday,

11:19.113 --> 11:20.810
cause a scene.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.899
So instead, you chose what?
To catch me off

11:22.943 --> 11:26.163
Oh, no. Uh, far from it.
I'll just... um...

11:26.207 --> 11:28.775
You've been so helpful
with our investigation

11:28.818 --> 11:31.647
into the illicit businesses
that Hank was running

11:31.691 --> 11:33.170
through HCI Global
that I just...

11:33.214 --> 11:35.216
I thought I'd just
pop in real quick

11:35.259 --> 11:37.522
without all the...
all the fanfare.

11:38.785 --> 11:40.177
That is to say,
without lawyers.

11:40.221 --> 11:42.440
Well, I am a lawyer.

11:42.484 --> 11:44.921
What is it you want,
Director Weitz?

11:44.965 --> 11:47.924
You want a swift end to the
black eye on your corporation.

11:47.968 --> 11:50.405
I need a couple more files
for my case.

11:50.448 --> 11:54.365
And you're opting to make this
request not through the courts.

11:55.802 --> 11:58.587
I mean, I could.
Mm.

11:58.630 --> 12:02.765
But that would be a lot
of attention from us
and the press.

12:02.809 --> 12:05.681
I just thought that this was
the quickest and easiest way

12:05.725 --> 12:07.639
for me to get
out of your hair.

12:09.946 --> 12:11.948
What records do you need?

12:11.992 --> 12:14.472
Great.

12:14.516 --> 12:18.650
Sorry I cut your
film short, Rich, but...

12:18.694 --> 12:22.567
your Book of Secrets history
film helped me crack a puzzle.

12:22.611 --> 12:24.134
Put the phone down
and come look.

12:24.178 --> 12:26.658
Okay.
So, that sea turtle

12:26.702 --> 12:28.791
made me think
of another turtle.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.793
Michelangelo,
Raphael.
No.

12:30.837 --> 12:31.968
Donatello.
Rich...

12:32.012 --> 12:33.578
Different angle.
Franklin.

12:33.622 --> 12:35.798
Yertle. Arthur.
No, he was an
anteater.
No.

12:35.842 --> 12:40.368
The cursor from Logo.
It's the shape of a turtle.

12:40.411 --> 12:43.284
Logo was an old program that
you could input simple commands

12:43.327 --> 12:45.373
to draw lines
and make pictures.

12:45.416 --> 12:47.375
Are you done
man-splaining the program

12:47.418 --> 12:49.029
on which I learned to code?
What'd you think,

12:49.072 --> 12:50.813
I was some Kid Pix hack?
Come on.

12:50.857 --> 12:52.380
What does this have to do
with Roman's data cache?

12:52.423 --> 12:54.295
Okay.

12:54.338 --> 12:57.037
These images, or logos,
were on the cache

12:57.080 --> 12:58.255
Roman left us in Tokyo.

12:58.299 --> 13:00.518
I think they solve
to logo commands.

13:00.562 --> 13:03.826
A fox, a bear,
a leopard, and a rhino.

13:03.870 --> 13:06.611
These mascots all begin
with the letters

13:06.655 --> 13:10.050
F, B, L, and R.Forward, backwards,
left, and right.

13:10.093 --> 13:13.488
Bingo.Okay. But that's still only
half the coding language.

13:13.531 --> 13:15.664
We still have to tell
the computer how long
the lines are.

13:15.707 --> 13:19.233
I think the colors
are the key to distance.

13:19.276 --> 13:20.974
So there's a reason
the fox is blue?

13:21.017 --> 13:23.541
Yes. The hue
of the blue fox

13:23.585 --> 13:25.674
has a value of 198
on the color wheel,

13:25.717 --> 13:30.287
so fox solves to
forward 198,

13:30.331 --> 13:33.247
green leopard
solves to left 90.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.205
I am a big fan of your brain.
Did you know that?

13:35.249 --> 13:37.207
There's, like,
30 commands here.

13:37.251 --> 13:39.253
Let's fire up this
turtle and giddy-up!
Okay.

13:45.085 --> 13:46.651
It's a giant asterisk.

13:46.695 --> 13:48.784
I think it's
the star of life.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.917
What if Roman is telling us
that the next cache

13:50.960 --> 13:53.963
contains medical info
on ZIP disease?

13:54.007 --> 13:55.704
Maybe even a cure for Jane.

13:55.747 --> 13:58.446
Okay, but what's the context?
We have no idea where to start.

13:58.489 --> 14:00.317
I think that's where
the seal comes in.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.667
What seal? Oh, the
random seal on the cache.

14:02.711 --> 14:04.887
It doesn't begin
with a command letter.

14:04.931 --> 14:06.019
What if it's S for start?

14:06.062 --> 14:08.543
Wait a minute.
Look at these colors.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.806
They're the same as the
official seal of the FBI.

14:10.850 --> 14:14.027
It is a seal-colored seal.
That is an adorable clue.

14:14.070 --> 14:16.072
What if Roman is
telling us to start here?

14:16.116 --> 14:19.510
Maybe even the giant FBI
seal on the lobby floor?

14:19.554 --> 14:21.686
Works for me.I'll tell the team.

14:21.730 --> 14:23.253
Hey, hey, hang on,
hang on, wait.

14:23.297 --> 14:25.081
Why don't you wait until
we actually have something,

14:25.125 --> 14:27.518
you know, until we've
struck gold, right?

14:27.562 --> 14:29.129
I mean, Reade's
already suspended

14:29.172 --> 14:30.347
and it's after 10:00.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.088
I figure Weller and Jane
are probably busy

14:32.132 --> 14:33.350
going at it,
pretty hot and heavy,

14:33.394 --> 14:34.917
you know what I mean?
You don't want to

14:34.961 --> 14:37.180
interrupt that sort
of congress.

14:40.575 --> 14:42.620
You really thought you
could get away with this?

14:42.664 --> 14:46.276
I did get away with it,
for months.

14:46.320 --> 14:47.930
What'd you do with
the money that you stole?

14:47.974 --> 14:50.106
Like I'd tell you.

14:50.150 --> 14:51.325
It doesn't matter.

14:51.368 --> 14:53.153
Whatever you're up to,

14:53.196 --> 14:54.894
it's over now.

14:56.591 --> 14:58.549
Well, I found
a decent Winston Pear library

14:58.593 --> 15:01.161
and a pretty atrocious
magazine collection.

15:01.204 --> 15:03.293
What I didn't find
was my money.

15:03.337 --> 15:04.599
You can let yourself out.

15:04.642 --> 15:06.122
Now the Dabbur Zann's
after me,

15:06.166 --> 15:07.167
and as you can imagine,

15:07.210 --> 15:08.298
terrorists
don't really like it

15:08.342 --> 15:09.386
when you lose their money,

15:09.430 --> 15:11.475
so, uh, let's take a ride.

15:22.182 --> 15:24.575
I'm gone a few days
and I come back to this?

15:24.619 --> 15:27.187
If I was alive, we wouldn't
be in this mess.

15:27.230 --> 15:29.015
Tired of hallucinating me?

15:29.058 --> 15:30.973
Then why am I here?

15:31.017 --> 15:33.367
Who else is gonna
help you get out of this?

15:33.410 --> 15:36.544
You really think you two
can trust each other?

15:36.587 --> 15:40.243
I mean, it's not like
your life depends on it.

15:47.598 --> 15:49.644
Oh, good, we're stopping.

15:51.167 --> 15:52.690
All right, everybody out.

15:52.734 --> 15:54.475
Let's go over the mission.

16:02.918 --> 16:05.225
Okay, well, uh,
Slick here is the only one

16:05.268 --> 16:07.227
with a gun pointed at you,
so that's good.

16:07.270 --> 16:10.186
You can disarm him and then
take out both these guys.

16:10.230 --> 16:13.494
Weller will have to
go with it or he might
just catch a bullet.

16:13.537 --> 16:17.454
You ready? Three, two...

16:20.196 --> 16:22.068
Ah, well,
that's inconvenient.

16:22.111 --> 16:25.027
We're half a mile out
from our final destination,

16:25.071 --> 16:26.724
an FBI evidence facility

16:26.768 --> 16:29.379
that you conveniently have
unfettered access to.

16:29.423 --> 16:31.686
You're gonna smuggle us
past the security gate

16:31.729 --> 16:33.035
and then inside
the evidence vault,

16:33.079 --> 16:35.385
and that is where
I'll extract my ticket

16:35.429 --> 16:36.821
to peace
with the Dabbur Zann.

16:36.865 --> 16:39.215
And that is?Not your concern.

16:39.259 --> 16:41.696
Tell us what we're stealing
or we don't play ball.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.524
Oh, you're playing.
Or, you know,

16:43.567 --> 16:45.656
I could just turn you into dust
with the click of a button.

16:45.700 --> 16:48.094
See these vests
you're gonna be wearing?

16:48.137 --> 16:50.226
They're rigged with C4.

16:50.270 --> 16:51.880
One detonator each.

16:51.923 --> 16:53.403
So, you know, if you
like your body parts

16:53.447 --> 16:55.971
all attached and everything,
don't get cute.

16:56.015 --> 16:58.060
Now put 'em on and let's go.

16:58.104 --> 17:01.107
Well, that makes the math
very complicated.

17:06.808 --> 17:08.331
Why would Roman send us
all around the building

17:08.375 --> 17:09.854
to find a data cache?

17:09.898 --> 17:11.639
Why not just give us
an exact location?

17:11.682 --> 17:13.771
Well, I mean, the mints
in the fifth floor bathroom

17:13.815 --> 17:15.773
were enough to sell me.
I mean, jeez,

17:15.817 --> 17:18.515
how do they make 'em
spicy hot and minty fresh
at the same time?

17:18.559 --> 17:20.256
Hmm. I taste
flavor country.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.084
Bathroom candy
can't be the answer.

17:22.128 --> 17:25.870
Okay, next is...
Oh, it's the last command.

17:25.914 --> 17:30.092
Left 30, forward 42.

17:30.136 --> 17:32.094
That's 14 feet.
That's good.

17:33.487 --> 17:34.966
Excuse me.
Huh?

17:35.010 --> 17:36.577
What is with you
and your phone tonight?

17:36.620 --> 17:38.100
Oh, nothing, I just
thought I got a text.

17:38.144 --> 17:39.232
You ever get that,
where you get

17:39.275 --> 17:41.016
a phantom vibration
in your pants

17:41.060 --> 17:43.279
but it's just probably
a muscle spasm

17:43.323 --> 17:45.803
or earthquake or...
It's Boston, okay?

17:45.847 --> 17:48.154
I was waiting to see
if he called me back.

17:48.197 --> 17:50.025
We are looking for
a potential cure for Jane.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.592
Pine for your ex
on your own time.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.028
Hey, I'm not pining
for him, okay?

17:53.072 --> 17:54.812
I am trying
to destroy him.
Why?

17:54.856 --> 17:56.249
'Cause ever since he helped
us with that last case,

17:56.292 --> 17:57.772
he's been gunning
for my job,

17:57.815 --> 17:58.990
so I've been
calling him a bunch,

17:59.034 --> 18:01.167
trying to mess
with his head.

18:01.210 --> 18:03.778
But he's not calling me
back, so it's kind of
messing with my head.

18:03.821 --> 18:05.823
I mean, I know he's
at home. He's under
house arrest, right?

18:05.867 --> 18:07.956
So I called him,
like, 1,000 times
on his land line,

18:07.999 --> 18:10.263
called from different
numbers. Maybe he
unplugged his phone,

18:10.306 --> 18:11.612
but then why aren't I
getting a busy signal?

18:11.655 --> 18:12.743
Okay, take a breath.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.618
Fork it over
before you self-destruct.

18:17.661 --> 18:21.143
Okay.
Oh, ignore any texts

18:21.187 --> 18:23.189
you get from a group chat
called Cream Team.

18:23.232 --> 18:25.147
It's not what you think.
What do you think it is?

18:25.191 --> 18:26.148
It's not--
It's not that.

18:26.192 --> 18:28.411
I'm gonna turn it off.
Okay.

18:28.455 --> 18:30.196
14 feet.
14 feet.
Here we go.

18:30.239 --> 18:32.633
Pardon me, pardon me.
Oh, heads up, heads up.

18:32.676 --> 18:35.157
Over or under, over or under.
There you go.

18:35.201 --> 18:36.376
Eh, 14 feet.

18:37.986 --> 18:39.379
Jeez! Thank you.

18:43.383 --> 18:45.515
Star of life
marks the spot.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.648
It's kind of an odd place
to bury treasure.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.269
Evening, boys.

19:00.313 --> 19:02.315
If it isn't my
favorite FBI power couple.

19:02.358 --> 19:04.273
That's us.Late night, huh?

19:04.317 --> 19:07.972
I don't see either of you
on the overnight access list.

19:08.016 --> 19:12.194
Well, the new guy in
the office, he obviously
forgot to call you again.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.239
Oh, what's his name?
I'll give him a call.

19:13.282 --> 19:14.370
Oh, do you have to?

19:14.414 --> 19:16.067
We don't want to
get him in trouble.

19:16.111 --> 19:18.200
He's a good guy.And he's about
to be reviewed,

19:18.244 --> 19:21.377
so could we make an
exception this time, Mikey?

19:21.421 --> 19:22.335
Please?

19:22.378 --> 19:24.250
One condition.

19:24.293 --> 19:27.253
Next time, bring coffee,
will you?

19:27.296 --> 19:28.689
Done.

19:34.738 --> 19:36.262
Oh!

19:37.828 --> 19:39.482
Almost forgot.
We gotta check the back.

19:41.049 --> 19:42.616
Oh, yeah, we, uh,

19:42.659 --> 19:44.226
we got a lot
of boxes back there.

19:44.270 --> 19:46.141
I'll, uh, I'll help you
sort through 'em.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.100
Don't worry about it.

19:49.144 --> 19:51.146
That's why they pay me
the big bucks.

20:05.508 --> 20:06.292
No phone.

20:08.337 --> 20:10.470
Just leave them and come on.
Let's go.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.921
Rich!?
Hey, Patterson.

20:26.964 --> 20:28.270
I got some bad news.

20:28.314 --> 20:30.707
I couldn't find
the data cache down there.

20:30.751 --> 20:34.320
'Cause you probably axed
it to pieces. Where'd
you even get that?

20:34.363 --> 20:36.713
You've obviously never snooped
around Briana's locker.

20:36.757 --> 20:38.280
Listen, I was
gentle with it, okay?

20:38.324 --> 20:40.456
All I hit was concrete,
maybe a gas line.

20:40.500 --> 20:42.066
You don't smell
anything funny, do you?

20:42.110 --> 20:44.852
You really think Roman
dug open the floor,

20:44.895 --> 20:47.071
dropped the data cache in,
and then resealed it

20:47.115 --> 20:48.551
without anyone noticing?

20:48.595 --> 20:49.726
I mean, from all
the footage I've seen,

20:49.770 --> 20:52.207
he was remarkably cat-like.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.644
I thought maybe he put it
in the electrical socket

20:54.688 --> 20:56.298
that used to be in the floor.

20:56.342 --> 20:58.300
A simple screwdriver
would have done the trick.

20:58.344 --> 20:59.867
No, I checked there first.
There was nothing.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.912
Come on, what do you think,
I'm an idiot? Ow.
Okay.

21:01.956 --> 21:04.306
We have to start over.Oh, boy. This is turning
into a real all-nighter.

21:04.350 --> 21:06.482
Classic us.
I'll make some coffee.

21:06.526 --> 21:08.136
Here you go.

21:19.190 --> 21:20.496
All right. My team outside

21:20.540 --> 21:21.932
can jam any alarms we trigger,

21:21.976 --> 21:23.717
but we only have 25 minutes
until those guards

21:23.760 --> 21:26.023
miss their check-in.
Gotta move fast.

21:26.067 --> 21:28.939
The evidence vault is
just around the corner.

21:28.983 --> 21:30.201
So are you gonna tell us
what we're supposed to steal?

21:30.245 --> 21:32.116
Nope. I'll just
get it myself.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.728
Make sure you wave hello
to all the security cameras.

21:34.771 --> 21:36.556
I actually did my homework
and there's none
in the facility.

21:36.599 --> 21:39.123
Except for the ones that are
hidden inside the vault.

21:39.167 --> 21:41.691
I signed off on them when
I was the Assistant Director.

21:41.735 --> 21:43.737
Just open the door.

21:43.780 --> 21:45.434
Yes, ma'am.

21:55.966 --> 21:59.187
You want to go in there,
be my guest.

21:59.230 --> 22:01.407
You caught me
on a hidden camera.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.191
You want to give the FBI
the same shot?

22:05.236 --> 22:09.545
You have 60 seconds to
drag out a case marked IC-219.

22:09.589 --> 22:11.155
If you fail...

22:11.199 --> 22:14.463
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Boom. We got it.

22:22.471 --> 22:25.387
We should split up.
We'll find the case faster.

22:25.431 --> 22:26.475
We're not giving her
the case.

22:26.519 --> 22:29.391
The second she gets it,
we die.

22:29.435 --> 22:31.393
Stop. Stop!

22:32.481 --> 22:33.569
Put your arms up.

22:33.613 --> 22:34.657
There's no time.

22:34.701 --> 22:37.138
Put your arms up.

22:42.665 --> 22:46.277
Damn it. These vests have
an anti-tamper trigger.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.758
Well, there's not
enough time for me
to disable it.

22:48.802 --> 22:51.457
We need to find the antenna
that's linked to the detonator.

22:51.500 --> 22:52.545
Okay.

22:55.896 --> 22:58.464
Back left corner.
Did you find mine yet?

22:58.507 --> 22:59.421
I'm working on it.

22:59.465 --> 23:02.250
40 seconds,
but who's counting?

23:03.469 --> 23:04.557
Got it.

23:06.036 --> 23:07.777
Okay, now we need
to find something

23:07.821 --> 23:10.301
that blocks the signal
from the detonator.

23:10.345 --> 23:11.390
Start a search.

23:14.523 --> 23:15.742
30 seconds.

23:21.051 --> 23:23.053
Yes! This'll do.

23:24.490 --> 23:25.665
Enough of this
should block the signal.

23:25.708 --> 23:27.449
You're gonna trust your life

23:27.493 --> 23:28.624
to reflective duct tape?
Come on!

23:28.668 --> 23:30.278
20 seconds!

23:30.321 --> 23:31.497
How many layers of
tape do we need

23:31.540 --> 23:33.629
to block the antenna?Three, maybe four.

23:33.673 --> 23:34.804
What about five?

23:34.848 --> 23:36.066
Let's go with six.

23:36.110 --> 23:37.633
Yeah, six'll work.

23:38.721 --> 23:40.157
Just...

23:44.379 --> 23:47.121
That poison needle
I caught you with,

23:47.164 --> 23:48.557
it was for me, wasn't it?

23:48.601 --> 23:51.604
You were getting suspicious.
I had to act.

23:51.647 --> 23:53.867
But you didn't, did you?
Why not?

23:53.910 --> 23:55.303
Time's up!

23:55.346 --> 23:58.393
Open that door
and come out with it!

23:58.437 --> 24:01.048
Now what?We find another way inside.

24:01.091 --> 24:03.920
And the agents?Oh, they had their chance.

24:03.964 --> 24:07.271
Hope your little protest
was worth it!

24:07.315 --> 24:08.359
See ya.

24:17.891 --> 24:19.719
And we're not dead.

24:21.242 --> 24:24.158
Not yet.

24:31.774 --> 24:33.080
There you go.

24:33.123 --> 24:34.211
You can take the vest off.

24:34.255 --> 24:36.475
I disabled
the anti-tamper trigger.

24:39.913 --> 24:41.175
What are you doing?

24:41.218 --> 24:43.307
I'm looking for the case
that Eve wants.

24:43.351 --> 24:45.092
I thought you weren't
gonna give it to her.

24:45.135 --> 24:48.356
I'm not. I just want to
know what she's after.

24:51.794 --> 24:53.622
Okay.

24:59.715 --> 25:01.238
What is it?

25:01.282 --> 25:03.414
I don't know.

25:03.458 --> 25:05.939
But if the Dabbur Zann
want it, it's nothing good.

25:07.506 --> 25:08.985
Roman's other caches
gave us clues

25:09.029 --> 25:10.596
on how to find the others.

25:10.639 --> 25:12.467
There's no reason to believe
this is any different.

25:12.511 --> 25:14.121
We're missing something.I gotta be honest,

25:14.164 --> 25:16.036
this is the lamest sleepover
I've ever been a part of.

25:16.079 --> 25:18.255
No junk food,
no scrambled porn.

25:18.299 --> 25:19.561
Hey, we should make
some prank phone calls.

25:19.605 --> 25:21.563
Can I have my phone back?Oh, nice try,

25:21.607 --> 25:22.608
but I'm not giving you
your phone back

25:22.651 --> 25:24.392
so you can
call Boston again.

25:24.435 --> 25:27.830
Hey, have you ever
stopped to think about

25:27.874 --> 25:30.746
that maybe engaging in
this toxic relationship

25:30.790 --> 25:31.921
might not be good for you?

25:31.965 --> 25:33.793
I don't think our
relationship is toxic.

25:33.836 --> 25:36.360
Noxious, maybe,
like it smells bad,

25:36.404 --> 25:37.797
but it's not gonna kill you.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.842
I think Boston is doing
the healthy thing

25:39.886 --> 25:41.801
by keeping his distance.

25:41.844 --> 25:44.020
Okay, who died
and made you Dr. Phil, huh?

25:44.064 --> 25:47.633
Okay, look,
maybe I occasionally

25:47.676 --> 25:50.853
use Boston to fill
an emptiness.
That's it.

25:50.897 --> 25:52.507
I mean, why else do I make
such inappropriate jokes?

25:52.551 --> 25:55.031
What if Roman used
someone at the FBI?

25:55.075 --> 25:57.643
What if the map is
pointing us to a person

25:57.686 --> 26:00.515
in the building,
not a place?
Okay.

26:02.691 --> 26:05.041
Bingo. When Roman
was still alive,

26:05.085 --> 26:07.478
there was a desk right
where the X is located.

26:07.522 --> 26:09.698
Okay, but whose desk?

26:09.742 --> 26:13.223
A data analyst,
Derek Wimble.
Hmm.

26:13.267 --> 26:15.182
Gonna bring him in.

26:15.225 --> 26:17.967
Okay, so we're just done
talking about my thing, then?

26:20.796 --> 26:23.669
You already disarmed
those, remember?

26:23.712 --> 26:25.540
Are you trying to blow us
both up or just me?

26:25.584 --> 26:27.063
I'm gonna use the C4
from the vests

26:27.107 --> 26:28.848
to blow a hole in
that wall.

26:28.891 --> 26:30.676
By the time Eve
gets through there,

26:30.719 --> 26:31.677
I'll be out of here
with that case.

26:31.720 --> 26:33.461
Why not just hand it over?

26:33.504 --> 26:35.028
If she gets what she
wants, maybe she'll decide

26:35.071 --> 26:36.507
it's smarter to walk away

26:36.551 --> 26:38.509
rather than shoot
two FBI agents.

26:38.553 --> 26:39.902
'Cause you're not
an FBI agent.

26:39.946 --> 26:41.295
You're a terrorist.

26:41.338 --> 26:42.862
What's the difference?

26:44.690 --> 26:47.475
Well, that's one hell
of a can opener.

26:52.872 --> 26:56.702
Tell me something.
Why do you hate me so much?You ruined my life.

26:56.745 --> 26:59.574
Everything fell apart
because of you.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.925
No. I was supposed to
fall in love with Jane.

27:02.969 --> 27:04.840
That was your plan.

27:04.884 --> 27:08.670
Things fell apart 'cause
Jane fell in love with me.

27:08.714 --> 27:12.631
You hate me because I remind
you of what a failure you are.

27:22.553 --> 27:24.381
We're out of time.
Like it or not,

27:24.425 --> 27:26.688
you want to protect
that case, you need me.

27:26.732 --> 27:30.736
Yes, I do. So, you're
gonna go and find
somewhere on that wall

27:30.779 --> 27:33.695
we can attach this,
and I'll finish here.

27:38.961 --> 27:41.790
Here you go.

27:41.834 --> 27:43.357
All the records
you requested.

27:44.750 --> 27:45.925
Hard copies, huh?

27:45.968 --> 27:48.710
Sorry for
the inconvenience.

27:48.754 --> 27:50.799
Not a problem.
I can handle heavy.

27:52.453 --> 27:54.890
What is it you
really want, Mr. Weitz?

27:54.934 --> 27:58.807
I mean, clearly you're
a man who isn't afraid
to make bold moves.

27:58.851 --> 28:01.375
I'm not sure I follow.

28:01.418 --> 28:04.160
Well, you have
quite a resume. Please.

28:05.945 --> 28:07.294
Assistant U.S. Attorney,

28:07.337 --> 28:10.297
Congress,
now head of the FBI.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.952
Your rise in power
has been impressive.

28:12.995 --> 28:14.954
I sense a however.

28:14.997 --> 28:16.912
It's just, the FBI
is a dead-end street.

28:16.956 --> 28:19.872
The longer you stay,
the more likely you are
to crash and burn.

28:19.915 --> 28:22.744
Sometimes the mark
of a good leader

28:22.788 --> 28:25.007
is knowing
when to move on.

28:25.051 --> 28:28.707
I can't wait to
understand what
you're talking about.

28:30.883 --> 28:33.450
I just hate
to see smart people

28:33.494 --> 28:36.105
put a ceiling
on their aspirations.

28:36.149 --> 28:39.761
And with the wealth
and influence of this
company behind me,

28:39.805 --> 28:41.545
I am in a unique position

28:41.589 --> 28:45.593
to help those people
achieve new heights,

28:45.636 --> 28:48.988
so I'm gonna ask you again,
Mr. Weitz,

28:49.031 --> 28:52.339
what is it you really want?

28:52.382 --> 28:55.777
Well, if you wanted
my attention,

28:55.821 --> 28:57.779
you certainly have it.

28:57.823 --> 29:00.173
Mm.

29:00.216 --> 29:03.350
What's so great
about Jane, anyway?

29:03.393 --> 29:05.482
Why do you
love her so much?

29:05.526 --> 29:07.833
She's the strongest person
I've ever met,

29:07.876 --> 29:10.618
and considering everything
that she's been through,

29:10.661 --> 29:13.839
she's still compassionate
and kind.

29:13.882 --> 29:16.450
I think you liked
Jane because she was
a damsel in distress

29:16.493 --> 29:18.017
and you got to play hero.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.976
That shows just how little
you know about her and me.

29:21.020 --> 29:23.849
She was a blank slate when
she crawled out of that bag,

29:23.892 --> 29:26.852
and you shaped her into exactly
what you needed her to be.

29:26.895 --> 29:28.854
Jane has exactly
what you don't.

29:28.897 --> 29:31.160
That's the choice to be
whoever she wants to be.

29:31.204 --> 29:34.076
You're the one that's
been shaped into a weapon.

29:34.120 --> 29:37.297
You are exactly what
your mother made you to be.

29:37.340 --> 29:40.039
Jane and I
aren't so different.

29:40.082 --> 29:42.868
You're wrong about that.

29:42.911 --> 29:45.522
Then why did it
take you so long

29:45.566 --> 29:47.394
to realize I wasn't her?

29:47.437 --> 29:49.439
I've been sleeping
in your bed,

29:49.483 --> 29:51.833
smiling at you
from across the table.

29:51.877 --> 29:54.836
How do you know it's Jane
you love so much?

29:54.880 --> 29:59.014
If we're so different,
why couldn't you tell us apart?

29:59.058 --> 30:02.017
There's definitely some
parts of you inside of her,

30:02.061 --> 30:04.237
parts that I do recognize,

30:04.280 --> 30:06.065
parts that keep her
alive out there.

30:06.108 --> 30:11.070
But being with you,
and looking at you now,

30:11.113 --> 30:13.507
I see there's nothing
of her inside of you.

30:23.473 --> 30:24.866
They're making
their way through.

30:29.784 --> 30:30.829
Ready?

30:46.975 --> 30:48.498
Move, now!

31:03.165 --> 31:06.081
They're gone.
The case is gone too.

31:06.125 --> 31:08.605
They couldn't have
gotten far.

31:08.649 --> 31:10.956
Find them and kill them.

31:22.532 --> 31:24.186
Down that hall.

31:49.342 --> 31:50.996
I'll get the case.I'll cover.

32:00.048 --> 32:01.354
Okay, let's move.

32:11.712 --> 32:13.975
How's it going
with your stack?

32:14.019 --> 32:15.455
Not well.

32:15.498 --> 32:16.978
They deleted
all the passenger

32:17.022 --> 32:19.850
and cargo manifests
for every flight.

32:19.894 --> 32:21.417
Now, I didn't
expect Zapata's name

32:21.461 --> 32:24.551
to just magically pop up,
but this...

32:24.594 --> 32:26.770
this is nothing.
No, no.

32:26.814 --> 32:28.685
Don't say that. Look,
there's a lot of
documents in there.

32:28.729 --> 32:30.339
People always
make mistakes.

32:30.383 --> 32:32.037
Madeline hasn't made one yet.
She's in full control.

32:32.080 --> 32:35.214
No, no, I'm telling you,
we rattled her cage tonight.

32:35.257 --> 32:37.172
Why do you say that?

32:37.216 --> 32:38.304
Just a feeling.

32:40.219 --> 32:41.437
That's it?

32:41.481 --> 32:44.005
Yeah.
I'm very intuitive.

32:44.049 --> 32:46.007
Okay, well, I'm glad
you're feeling optimistic,

32:46.051 --> 32:49.663
because my feeling is,
we already got this
stuff from the FAA.

32:49.706 --> 32:52.492
Flight plans,
tail numbers...

32:54.711 --> 32:57.888
Oh, I like the look
of that face.

32:57.932 --> 32:59.064
What do you got?

32:59.107 --> 33:01.066
Well, this flight plan
was signed off

33:01.109 --> 33:04.069
by a James B. Kelley.
He's a pilot.

33:04.112 --> 33:08.116
Now, what if he's the JB
Zapata and the MI6 agent
were referring to?

33:08.160 --> 33:11.467
We have two hours,
or JB goes ahead without us,

33:11.511 --> 33:13.643
and you don't want that,
trust me.

33:13.687 --> 33:15.210
Yeah, yeah,
James B. Kelley.

33:15.254 --> 33:16.211
His signature is on
a lot of these things.

33:16.255 --> 33:17.734
The flights and dates
match up

33:17.778 --> 33:20.041
with the places we know
Zapata's already been.

33:20.085 --> 33:23.044
Zurich, Stockholm...

33:23.088 --> 33:26.743
the flight into New York.You think she's using
the same pilot every time?

33:26.787 --> 33:29.224
It would be a smart way
to keep the circle small.You know, it's a long shot.

33:29.268 --> 33:31.835
I bet there's a lot of JBs
who work at HCI Global.

33:31.879 --> 33:33.620
Well, this one
seems to be the only one

33:33.663 --> 33:35.230
with a direct connection
to Zapata,

33:35.274 --> 33:36.579
so I'll take it.

33:39.930 --> 33:43.064
I'm an FBI analyst,
not some criminal.

33:43.108 --> 33:44.761
Can we just talk in the
conference room or something?

33:44.805 --> 33:47.068
It's booked solid.It's midnight.

33:47.112 --> 33:49.679
Don't you dare.Okay, let's get started.

33:49.723 --> 33:51.899
Do you recognize this man?

33:51.942 --> 33:53.901
Sure, that's Roman Briggs.So, you admit
to helping him

33:53.944 --> 33:56.077
infiltrate the FBI?
Was it for fame?

33:56.121 --> 33:58.949
Money? The thrill
of betraying your country?

33:58.993 --> 34:01.474
What?! No!Oh, my God,
you were in love with him.

34:01.517 --> 34:05.304
He was a wanted terrorist.
Of course I recognize him.

34:05.347 --> 34:09.134
No, we have intel that points
directly to you

34:09.177 --> 34:10.265
being in league with Roman.

34:10.309 --> 34:12.006
Directly how?

34:12.050 --> 34:13.660
Long story short,
a treasure map,

34:13.703 --> 34:15.140
your old desk,
and a turtle.

34:15.183 --> 34:17.142
That may have been
too short a story.

34:17.185 --> 34:19.144
If you helped Roman
with anything,

34:19.187 --> 34:20.884
coming clean now will be

34:20.928 --> 34:22.277
better for you
in the long run.

34:22.321 --> 34:23.931
If you know where
his data cache is,

34:23.974 --> 34:25.324
you need to tell us.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.369
What would Roman
want with me, anyway?

34:27.413 --> 34:30.285
When I'm not with
the translation team
in sub-basement 2,

34:30.329 --> 34:33.723
I spend most of my time taking
notes for the white collar
division on the fifth floor.

34:36.335 --> 34:39.164
Oh, my God.
That's why Roman's puzzle

34:39.207 --> 34:41.209
was taking us
all over the building.

34:41.253 --> 34:44.734
He was showing us all of the
places that Derek has access to.

34:44.778 --> 34:47.215
That's creepy.
Why would he do that?

34:54.570 --> 34:56.616
He was pointing us
to your access card.

34:58.183 --> 34:59.836
More specifically,

34:59.880 --> 35:01.490
this microSD chip
he hid inside it.

35:01.534 --> 35:04.145
We just found
Roman's next data cache.

35:13.111 --> 35:15.374
Now, this next door.

35:15.417 --> 35:16.723
It'll take us down
to the parking lot.

35:16.766 --> 35:19.160
We're almost out of here.Oh, yeah

35:22.555 --> 35:24.383
No.

35:24.426 --> 35:26.080
They've got us
boxed in.

35:26.124 --> 35:28.387
All right, you two
have had your fun,

35:28.430 --> 35:30.258
but it's time to end this.

35:30.302 --> 35:33.566
You heard the lady.
Time to end this.

35:33.609 --> 35:35.394
We gotta find
another way out of here.

35:35.437 --> 35:38.092
Let's double back,
try to find an entry
they're not covering.

35:38.136 --> 35:40.355
I'll take the case,
you take point?
Copy that.

35:40.399 --> 35:41.791
Okay.

35:46.361 --> 35:48.146
Jane, what are you doing?

35:49.625 --> 35:52.193
Jane, don't.

35:52.237 --> 35:56.110
Jane's dead.
My name is Remi.

35:57.285 --> 35:58.199
Stop!

36:00.419 --> 36:01.289
Jane!

36:02.899 --> 36:04.901
Jane! No!

36:06.947 --> 36:08.601
No!

36:15.608 --> 36:17.262
Fingers off those triggers.

36:17.305 --> 36:19.220
This turns into
a shootout,

36:19.264 --> 36:21.614
I'll empty this clip
right into this case.

36:21.657 --> 36:24.225
That's a strange tactic
for an FBI agent.

36:24.269 --> 36:27.402
I'm not FBI. Just someone
who wants to survive.

36:27.446 --> 36:29.404
You get your case,
I walk away,

36:29.448 --> 36:31.363
everyone wins.
Everyone?

36:31.406 --> 36:34.235
It's that easy, huh?You're smart, Eve.

36:34.279 --> 36:35.410
The guards
missed their check-in.

36:35.454 --> 36:36.846
Neither one of us
wants to be here

36:36.890 --> 36:38.457
when backup arrives.

36:38.500 --> 36:39.588
There's no reason
the both of us

36:39.632 --> 36:41.373
can't get what we want
tonight.

36:47.727 --> 36:48.771
All right, get it!

36:50.947 --> 36:52.340
Open it.

36:54.516 --> 36:56.692
Load her up.
Let's get out of here.

37:40.388 --> 37:41.868
How'd it go with Weitz?

37:41.911 --> 37:45.306
Good, I think.
Time will tell.

37:45.350 --> 37:47.352
I told you
Matthew was malleable,

37:47.395 --> 37:48.570
and I was right.

37:48.614 --> 37:50.355
Did you find our hacker?

37:50.398 --> 37:52.182
I checked with
a dark web contact.

37:52.226 --> 37:53.967
Del Toro's been off
the grid for a reason.

37:54.010 --> 37:55.534
He's exclusively contracted

37:55.577 --> 37:57.536
to the
Sabinito drug cartel.

37:57.579 --> 37:58.537
What kind of work
is he doing?

37:58.580 --> 37:59.973
According to my source,

38:00.016 --> 38:01.540
he's hacked
the Mexican government,

38:01.583 --> 38:03.585
the DEA, ATF...

38:03.629 --> 38:07.154
His algorithm's even crashed
planes of rival cartels.

38:07.197 --> 38:08.503
Sounds like our man.

38:08.547 --> 38:09.678
But if he's
that valuable to them,

38:09.722 --> 38:11.506
they're not just
gonna loan him out.

38:11.550 --> 38:13.029
So, what are we gonna do?

38:13.073 --> 38:15.118
I go to Mexico
and convince 'em to share,

38:15.162 --> 38:18.731
show them that a powerful
company like HCI Global

38:18.774 --> 38:20.428
makes a better friend
than enemy.

38:20.472 --> 38:23.344
Looks like we're
going to Mexico.
We?

38:23.388 --> 38:25.694
If this thing is as difficult
as you think it might be,

38:25.738 --> 38:27.261
you're gonna need
all the help you can get,

38:27.305 --> 38:30.612
and I can be very persuasive
when I choose to be.

38:30.656 --> 38:34.964
Besides, it might be fun.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.317
All right, here we go.

38:40.405 --> 38:41.536
All right.

38:41.580 --> 38:43.582
Encryption is simple.

38:43.625 --> 38:45.584
Should only take a minute
for the system to crack it.

38:45.627 --> 38:47.412
Is that my phone?

38:47.455 --> 38:48.717
I thought you
had it turned off.

38:48.761 --> 38:51.764
I did. Somebody must have
turned it on remotely.

38:51.807 --> 38:53.243
People can do that?
Let me see here.

38:53.287 --> 38:55.594
Oh-ho, it's Boston.

38:55.637 --> 38:58.510
I knew he couldn't
keep that up, huh?
Okay, let's see.

38:58.553 --> 39:00.729
Oh, it must be killing
him that I'm not
picking up the phone yet,

39:00.773 --> 39:03.384
but I'm not doing it,
and that's not the
only reason either.

39:03.428 --> 39:05.081
It's because you were
right-- I'm engaged

39:05.125 --> 39:06.561
in a pattern of
destructive behavior

39:06.605 --> 39:08.302
and so I'm going to
raise above the fray

39:08.346 --> 39:10.043
and be the evolved man
that I am

39:10.086 --> 39:12.045
and not pick this up.

39:12.088 --> 39:14.874
I'm a new person.
Self love. Self care.

39:14.917 --> 39:19.487
Boston Bos
It's Richie boy. Hello?

39:20.706 --> 39:22.229
Oh, I missed it.

39:22.272 --> 39:24.231
Okay, okay, so he's
gonna leave a voicemail.

39:24.274 --> 39:26.755
That's fine. Why isn't he
leaving me a voicemail?

39:26.799 --> 39:29.628
I was right.

39:29.671 --> 39:31.107
The cache is filled
with medical info.

39:31.151 --> 39:33.240
Brain scans, drug trials,

39:33.283 --> 39:36.286
research on
experimental procedures.

39:36.330 --> 39:39.507
I think we just got closer
to finding a cure for Jane.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.555
I never took you
for a wing guy.

39:43.598 --> 39:45.687
I always thought of you
as someone who didn't
like to get messy.

39:45.731 --> 39:47.472
Guess we both have secrets,

39:47.515 --> 39:49.387
except I just don't
know any of yours.

39:50.736 --> 39:52.477
Something
on your mind, Ed?

39:52.520 --> 39:54.435
You said you just
had a feeling

39:54.479 --> 39:56.089
we rattled
Madeline's cage tonight.

39:56.132 --> 39:59.440
Now, are you gonna jeopardize
our careers on a hunch?

39:59.484 --> 40:01.355
What aren't you telling me?

40:03.052 --> 40:06.012
Madeline offered to help
make me president.

40:06.055 --> 40:08.449
Now, you think she'd
be that generous

40:08.493 --> 40:10.146
if we weren't close
to something?

40:10.190 --> 40:11.452
You turn her down?

40:11.496 --> 40:14.020
Ye...
Explicitly?

40:14.063 --> 40:15.456
So, no.

40:15.500 --> 40:17.284
Do you still think
I'm gonna burn you?

40:17.327 --> 40:19.329
Look, I'm just trying
to manage expectations.

40:19.373 --> 40:20.679
It's really
difficult to figure out

40:20.722 --> 40:22.115
what's going on
in that head of yours.

40:22.158 --> 40:25.248
Reade, buddy,
right now, you and me,

40:25.292 --> 40:26.641
we want the same thing.

40:26.685 --> 40:29.296
But who knows
what the future holds?

40:29.339 --> 40:31.516
That's part of the fun,
right, pal?

40:34.519 --> 40:37.522
Oh, JB Kelley just filed
a flight plan for Mexico.

40:37.565 --> 40:38.740
His plane
left 15 minutes ago.

40:38.784 --> 40:40.481
Look, Zapata might be
on that plane.

40:40.525 --> 40:42.614
This is it. This is how
we get ahead of the CIA.

40:42.657 --> 40:43.702
I gotta go get her.

40:43.745 --> 40:46.182
Uh, we gotta go get her.

40:46.226 --> 40:49.490
Whoa, whoa, Matthew,
this isn't a press conference.

40:49.534 --> 40:51.361
You have no idea what
you're about to walk into.

40:51.405 --> 40:52.928
Neither do you.

40:52.972 --> 40:55.496
You're gonna need all
the help you can get.

40:56.584 --> 40:57.672
I call aisle seat.

40:57.716 --> 40:59.500
Hey, Weitz!

41:15.647 --> 41:17.997
So you did make it
out of there.

41:18.040 --> 41:19.607
Remi.

41:19.651 --> 41:22.567
I was a few blocks away
when I heard the explosion.

41:22.610 --> 41:23.959
If I didn't
know any better,

41:24.003 --> 41:26.353
I'd say you were
worried about me.

41:27.876 --> 41:30.009
I'm only worried that
you'll get in my way.

41:30.052 --> 41:32.707
There's no reason to come
looking for me, Kurt.

41:32.751 --> 41:35.710
Jane is gone,
so let her go.

41:35.754 --> 41:37.146
I don't think so.

41:37.190 --> 41:38.974
I think you called

41:39.018 --> 41:41.455
because some part of you
still cares about me.

41:41.499 --> 41:42.717
That's why you locked me
in that hallway

41:42.761 --> 41:43.762
instead of killing me.

41:43.805 --> 41:45.590
Maybe there's
some part of Jane

41:45.633 --> 41:47.592
still inside of you,

41:47.635 --> 41:49.419
and I'm not
giving up on her.

41:49.463 --> 41:50.943
Well, that's good to hear.

41:50.986 --> 41:52.553
Because as long
as you believe that,

41:52.597 --> 41:54.207
you can't kill me either,

41:54.250 --> 41:56.122
but if I see you again,

41:56.165 --> 41:58.559
I won't have that problem.

41:58.603 --> 41:59.821
I will find you.

41:59.865 --> 42:04.565
I will not give up
on my wife.

42:04.609 --> 42:07.699
I will get her back.

42:07.742 --> 42:10.397
So then I guess it's game on.

42:20.712 --> 42:23.628
♪♪

42:49.828 --> 42:50.872
Greg, move your head.
