00:00.026 --> 00:01.064
Previously on
<i>Bones...</i>

00:01.065 --> 00:01.910
<i> We were right.</i>

00:01.911 --> 00:03.799
<i>There was a conspiracy</i>
<i>in the FBI.</i>

00:05.401 --> 00:06.402
<i>They're counting on you</i>

00:06.403 --> 00:07.902
<i>getting killed in here, Booth.</i>

00:07.937 --> 00:09.671
That way, they can keep
their hands clean.

00:09.706 --> 00:11.773
<i>Cooper's death could be</i>
<i>the point of origin</i>

00:11.808 --> 00:14.075
- for this entire conspiracy?
<i>- We solve this,</i>

00:14.110 --> 00:15.710
<i>we could find out who's behind</i>
<i>the whole thing.</i>

00:15.745 --> 00:18.279
Who are you?
Special Agent James Aubrey. FBI.

00:18.314 --> 00:20.148
The case that I was on
before I was

00:20.183 --> 00:21.482
thrown into jail
is still open.

00:21.518 --> 00:22.550
I intend to finish that.

00:22.585 --> 00:23.951
Mr. Hoover called me

00:23.987 --> 00:24.987
a great soldier.

00:24.988 --> 00:26.320
J. Edgar Hoover?

00:26.356 --> 00:28.556
You were with the Bureau?
Yes.

00:29.559 --> 00:30.925
There is a conspiracy here.

00:30.960 --> 00:32.726
Now, whatever is crucial to us,
we must consider

00:32.762 --> 00:34.128
crucial to them.

00:34.164 --> 00:35.163
Stark pulled me off the case.

00:35.198 --> 00:37.198
Sanderson must be
making more threats.

00:37.233 --> 00:38.593
I just... I didn't
have any choice.

00:38.601 --> 00:39.801
Right. 'Cause you
were blackmailed.

00:39.836 --> 00:42.070
Who is "they"?

00:42.105 --> 00:43.504
- Sweets!
- What happened?

00:43.540 --> 00:44.472
I don't know.

00:44.507 --> 00:45.473
Looks like massive

00:45.508 --> 00:47.875
internal trauma.

00:47.911 --> 00:50.411
He's gone, Booth.

00:50.447 --> 00:51.913
I don't know if I can

00:51.948 --> 00:53.514
- do this to him.
- This is not Sweets.

00:53.550 --> 00:56.484
This is a set of remains

00:56.519 --> 00:58.352
that will give us the man
who killed Sweets.

01:01.991 --> 01:03.825
All right, look, have you
checked all the hospitals,

01:03.860 --> 01:05.593
the urgent care?
...the autopsy, I need the tissue debrided,

01:05.628 --> 01:07.328
so I can get...
But Sweets said that he shot him,

01:07.363 --> 01:08.796
there was a blood trail.
...a profile of the killer.

01:08.832 --> 01:10.098
One more thing.
Just listen to me...

01:10.133 --> 01:11.566
Then it's up to Hodgins

01:11.601 --> 01:13.167
until I get the bones.
Thanks.

01:13.203 --> 01:14.769
All right, the killer
could also have been there.

01:14.804 --> 01:16.003
Right.

01:16.039 --> 01:17.238
Just check back
with me soon.

01:17.273 --> 01:19.373
Right.

01:20.910 --> 01:22.790
Is Cam finished with the autopsy?
She said soon.

01:22.812 --> 01:25.246
You know what?
I should've served the warrant.

01:25.281 --> 01:26.647
You know? Not Sweets.

01:26.683 --> 01:28.149
It's not your fault...
It is

01:28.184 --> 01:29.383
my fault, Bones, okay?

01:29.419 --> 01:30.685
Look, I am the senior agent.

01:30.720 --> 01:32.153
Do you understand?
It is my responsibility.

01:32.188 --> 01:33.554
That's why we're going

01:33.590 --> 01:35.356
to find out what happened,

01:35.391 --> 01:37.759
who's behind all of this.

01:37.794 --> 01:39.761
We're gonna do that for Sweets.

01:39.796 --> 01:42.330
We have to do that.

01:42.365 --> 01:46.033
All right?
He was... family.

01:46.069 --> 01:48.202
Yes, he was.

01:48.238 --> 01:50.571
I'm ready.

01:50.607 --> 01:53.007
Oh, for what, honey?

01:53.042 --> 01:55.376
Uncle Sweets and Daisy are
taking me to the park today.

01:55.411 --> 01:58.746
They said we can ride
the paddle boat.

02:02.752 --> 02:04.886
Come here, honey.

02:05.822 --> 02:07.221
Come here.

02:08.958 --> 02:10.291
Hey.

02:12.000 --> 02:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:28.044 --> 02:30.244
What should I do?

02:30.280 --> 02:31.712
Hey.

02:31.748 --> 02:33.581
You don't have to be
here for this, Daisy.

02:33.616 --> 02:34.816
I can take care of this.

02:34.851 --> 02:36.651
Am I supposed to sit at home,

02:36.686 --> 02:39.253
stare at pictures and weep
when I could be of use?

02:39.289 --> 02:43.191
No, I just meant that...
Lance would be here for me.

02:44.661 --> 02:46.027
Okay.

02:46.062 --> 02:48.396
You could bring these

02:48.431 --> 02:50.031
to the bone
room and begin

02:50.066 --> 02:52.200
rearticulating
the, uh...

02:52.235 --> 02:54.368
remains.

02:59.409 --> 03:02.476
He suffered a linear fracture
to his right femur.

03:02.512 --> 03:04.345
It would have
taken a substantial

03:04.380 --> 03:05.780
amount of force
to cause this wound.

03:05.815 --> 03:07.448
As well as
knowing exactly

03:07.483 --> 03:09.617
what point to strike.

03:09.652 --> 03:11.419
I also see fractures

03:11.454 --> 03:13.621
on the greater cornua of the hyoid.
Yes.

03:13.656 --> 03:16.324
And while I was cleaning
the bones, I noticed

03:16.359 --> 03:18.459
crushing injuries to
the thyroid cartilages

03:18.494 --> 03:21.362
which indicate the use
of a broad surface

03:21.397 --> 03:23.130
in the attempted strangulation.

03:23.166 --> 03:24.465
Which is a submission move

03:24.500 --> 03:25.967
typically used by people
in the military.

03:26.002 --> 03:27.201
Booth was right.

03:27.237 --> 03:28.836
This was a trained killer.

03:28.872 --> 03:30.972
I found cause of death.

03:32.442 --> 03:33.642
You can see from
Sweets' heart.

03:33.676 --> 03:35.543
The aorta
was torn.

03:35.578 --> 03:37.178
Which happened
when the killer

03:37.213 --> 03:39.413
struck his chest,
causing inward

03:39.449 --> 03:41.015
fracturing of ribs
three through eight

03:41.050 --> 03:42.383
on the left side.

03:42.418 --> 03:43.751
I just wish that we'd

03:43.786 --> 03:45.319
never uncovered
this whole conspiracy.

03:45.355 --> 03:46.754
But we did.

03:46.789 --> 03:48.589
And if we're going
to put an end to it,

03:48.625 --> 03:50.658
we need to destroy
its central nervous system.

03:50.693 --> 03:51.926
The conspiracy is not

03:51.961 --> 03:53.281
a sentient life form,
Dr. Hodgins.

03:53.296 --> 03:54.829
I disagree.

03:54.864 --> 03:57.398
It's grown the same way
any living organism grows.

03:57.433 --> 03:58.666
Then how
do you propose

03:58.701 --> 04:00.067
to break down
this... organism

04:00.103 --> 04:01.736
to give us
the leader?

04:01.771 --> 04:03.871
We map its DNA.

04:03.907 --> 04:05.806
That's brilliant.

04:05.842 --> 04:08.342
We use all the names
on the chip,

04:08.378 --> 04:10.044
we analyze their behavior,

04:10.079 --> 04:12.413
we see if it coincides
with the events

04:12.448 --> 04:13.648
of the past two decades.

04:13.683 --> 04:15.616
I might be able
to figure this out.

04:15.652 --> 04:17.250
I'll-I'll see you later.

04:19.088 --> 04:20.553
Look at this.

04:20.589 --> 04:22.423
It's a dyed velour fiber.

04:22.458 --> 04:23.724
It was deposited

04:23.760 --> 04:25.026
onto Sweets' shirt

04:25.061 --> 04:26.327
from the bottom of
the killer's shoe.

04:26.362 --> 04:27.695
How does
that help?

04:27.730 --> 04:29.630
It tells us the car
he was driving.

04:29.666 --> 04:31.899
This fiber is
from the floor mats

04:31.935 --> 04:33.534
of a Mercedes Designo Edition.

04:33.569 --> 04:36.270
There's not a lot
of those around.

04:39.208 --> 04:41.709
Look, you sure
this is the vehicle?

04:41.744 --> 04:43.277
Sanderson Chemical is
less than a block away

04:43.313 --> 04:44.545
and techs confirmed
that the floor mats

04:44.580 --> 04:46.981
match the fibers
Dr. Hodgins found,

04:47.016 --> 04:49.216
so I'm going with "yes."

04:49.252 --> 04:50.451
Who's the car registered to?

04:50.486 --> 04:52.053
A woman in
Silver Spring.

04:52.088 --> 04:53.854
She's out of town,
so the theft wasn't reported.

04:53.890 --> 04:55.756
These guys are good.

04:55.792 --> 04:58.159
Look, Aubrey,
Sweets is dead, okay?

04:58.194 --> 04:59.994
Don't sound so impressed
with the bad guys.

05:00.029 --> 05:01.762
We still have road
blocks set up, okay?

05:01.798 --> 05:03.764
A pro would hide inside
of the perimeter

05:03.800 --> 05:05.800
until the whole area
was cleared. Got it?

05:05.835 --> 05:08.402
Hey, I think
I have something.

05:09.439 --> 05:11.038
It's a blood trail.

05:11.074 --> 05:13.107
It's light,
but it passes

05:13.142 --> 05:14.342
by the car,

05:14.377 --> 05:16.777
disappears into the mud.

05:16.813 --> 05:18.413
That means Sweets's shot
didn't kill him.

05:18.414 --> 05:19.580
He's still in the area.

05:19.615 --> 05:22.249
Seriously?
The guy sticks around?

05:22.285 --> 05:24.518
So the killer,
he leaves... Sweets,

05:24.554 --> 05:26.387
he gets back here,

05:26.422 --> 05:29.190
can't drive his car, he's got
to get to a higher ground.

05:30.326 --> 05:33.327
He's got to be up on the roof.

05:33.363 --> 05:35.596
Tactical advantage
means the killer

05:35.631 --> 05:37.665
plans on fighting
his way out.

05:39.035 --> 05:40.267
Are you a good shot?

05:40.303 --> 05:41.736
I don't miss.

05:41.771 --> 05:44.238
Neither do I, so get
ready for a kill shot.

06:22.345 --> 06:24.545
Good work, Sweets.

06:24.580 --> 06:25.980
Oh, my God.

06:26.015 --> 06:27.314
That's Kenneth Emory.

06:27.350 --> 06:28.416
You know this guy?

06:28.451 --> 06:30.317
We were at Quantico together.

06:30.353 --> 06:32.720
Before he left
to join the SEALs.

Look, Sweets said

07:15.238 --> 07:17.558
the documents were taken, okay?
They weren't on the killer.

07:17.573 --> 07:19.273
We're having
the entire area searched,

07:19.308 --> 07:20.674
from Sweets' murder scene
to the roof.

07:20.710 --> 07:22.309
If he hid the docs,
we'll find them.

07:28.117 --> 07:30.037
All right, you know what?
He did I.D. the killer,

07:30.052 --> 07:32.119
so you know what, I'm gonna
give him one more day.

07:32.154 --> 07:33.287
Welcome back,
Agent Booth.

07:33.322 --> 07:34.822
Deputy Director Stark.

07:34.857 --> 07:35.923
You know what?
I'm here because of Sweets,

07:35.958 --> 07:37.224
okay, and he'd want that.

07:37.260 --> 07:39.893
Whatever the reason,
I'm grateful.

07:39.929 --> 07:42.663
I hear Sweets' killer was
connected to the Bureau.

07:42.698 --> 07:45.566
Yeah. I was at the academy
with Emory.

07:45.601 --> 07:47.201
A couple months into training,

07:47.236 --> 07:49.303
he was accused of assaulting
a female cadet.

07:49.338 --> 07:51.338
Looked like he was
going to be prosecuted,

07:51.374 --> 07:53.140
and then the whole
thing just went away.

07:53.175 --> 07:54.842
And so did Emory.

07:54.877 --> 07:56.844
- Someone covered it up.
- Right, and he became

07:56.879 --> 07:58.212
one of Sanderson's
foot soldiers.

07:58.247 --> 08:00.281
An accusation for which
you have no proof.

08:00.316 --> 08:01.949
Yet.
Look...

08:01.984 --> 08:04.451
you gonna throw me
off this case again?

08:05.655 --> 08:07.721
No.

08:07.757 --> 08:09.723
You do what you have to.

08:09.759 --> 08:12.092
You don't even need
to send me reports.

08:13.696 --> 08:16.030
And I'm sorry about Sweets.

08:16.065 --> 08:19.133
I wish to hell
I could turn back the clock.

08:19.168 --> 08:21.835
Wow, no reports.

08:21.871 --> 08:23.071
Never heard of that happening.

08:23.105 --> 08:25.172
It doesn't.

08:25.207 --> 08:27.474
Stark wants you to trust him.

08:29.979 --> 08:31.412
I'm noticing
avulsion fractures

08:31.447 --> 08:33.414
to Emory's second,
third and fourth

08:33.448 --> 08:35.082
right proximal phalanges.

08:35.116 --> 08:36.482
Sweets must've
broke them

08:36.519 --> 08:38.052
when the assailant
tried to strangle him.

08:38.087 --> 08:39.620
Now, the victim
was shot

08:39.655 --> 08:41.221
in the abdomen
and bled out

08:41.256 --> 08:43.222
as a result of the transection

08:43.259 --> 08:45.559
of the superior
mesenteric artery.

08:45.594 --> 08:47.695
A slow and
painful death.

08:47.730 --> 08:49.563
It's exactly what he deserved.

08:49.598 --> 08:51.465
I've been comparing
injuries on Lance

08:51.500 --> 08:53.834
to those on the X-rays
of the assailant.

08:53.869 --> 08:56.070
Fractures to Lance's
fourth and fifth metacarpals...

08:56.105 --> 08:58.105
- Boxer fractures.
- Yes.

08:58.140 --> 08:59.807
They correspond to
the microfractures

08:59.842 --> 09:01.122
on the assailant's
temporal bone.

09:01.143 --> 09:02.476
Wait, excuse me.

09:02.511 --> 09:04.044
The trajectory
of the bullet

09:04.080 --> 09:07.081
that you tracked,
Dr. Saroyan... it...

09:07.116 --> 09:09.650
it shouldn't have hit
that artery.

09:13.322 --> 09:15.022
It didn't.

09:15.057 --> 09:17.791
Would you like to describe
what you see, Ms. Wick?

09:17.827 --> 09:21.829
A tiny nick on the anterior
aspect of the L1.

09:21.864 --> 09:23.230
The wound track

09:23.265 --> 09:25.299
is indicative of a small blade,

09:25.334 --> 09:26.533
not a bullet.

09:26.569 --> 09:28.335
Excellent,
Ms. Wick.

09:28.371 --> 09:29.903
Maybe Emory tried to remove
the bullet himself

09:29.939 --> 09:31.171
and nicked the artery

09:31.207 --> 09:33.040
in the process.
But there was no blade

09:33.075 --> 09:34.675
found near his body.

09:34.710 --> 09:37.711
Someone wanted to make sure
Emory didn't survive,

09:37.747 --> 09:40.147
and used the bullet hole
to hide the murder.

09:42.885 --> 09:44.485
I'm not questioning
your judgment here,

09:44.520 --> 09:46.420
but what exactly are you
hoping to accomplish with this?

09:46.455 --> 09:47.721
I'm gonna look him in the eyes

09:47.757 --> 09:49.117
and tell him
his days are numbered.

09:49.125 --> 09:50.891
So you're going
to piss Sanderson off?

09:50.926 --> 09:52.860
Exactly. Pissed-off
people act irrationally.

09:52.895 --> 09:54.261
They make mistakes.

09:54.296 --> 09:55.662
Nice.
Go for it.

09:55.698 --> 09:57.097
Hey. You.

09:57.133 --> 09:58.999
Just kill someone
outside your office,

09:59.034 --> 10:00.667
you mop up the blood
and what do you do?

10:00.703 --> 10:02.136
You just go back
to work, right?

10:02.171 --> 10:03.704
I am sorry about your colleague,

10:03.739 --> 10:05.038
but I have a business to run.

10:05.074 --> 10:06.807
Right, and I have
a case to solve.

10:06.842 --> 10:09.109
We're done.
No, we're not done.

10:09.145 --> 10:11.178
I want to know what were in
those documents that Sweets had

10:11.213 --> 10:13.614
that were so important that
you had to take his life.

10:13.649 --> 10:15.315
Do I have to call
your boss again?

10:15.351 --> 10:16.950
Please, do.

10:16.986 --> 10:19.052
Because a few more calls and
I'll be able to arrest you

10:19.088 --> 10:21.688
for impeding a murder
investigation.

10:21.724 --> 10:23.624
He looks pissed,

10:23.659 --> 10:24.691
Agent Booth.

10:24.727 --> 10:26.326
Yeah, he does.

10:26.362 --> 10:28.529
I'll tell you what, I'll
let you get back to work.

10:28.564 --> 10:30.931
I'm sure you've got some
more polluting to do.

10:35.271 --> 10:36.770
Hey.

10:36.806 --> 10:38.572
So, I think
you're right.

10:38.607 --> 10:41.141
The-the links between
the people blackmailed

10:41.177 --> 10:42.910
and the positions
they occupied

10:42.945 --> 10:44.978
created more
compromised individuals

10:45.014 --> 10:46.280
who could then
be blackmailed,

10:46.315 --> 10:48.315
who then blackmailed
other people...

10:48.350 --> 10:50.217
This is like a...

10:50.252 --> 10:52.986
Like a eukaryotic,
phagotrophic bacterivore.

10:53.022 --> 10:54.755
I have no idea what that is,

10:54.790 --> 10:57.524
but you've been right
so far, so... yeah.

10:57.560 --> 10:59.726
I was going through Sweets'
effects. I found his notepad.

10:59.762 --> 11:01.094
He was thorough.

11:01.130 --> 11:03.063
It's probably the shrink training.
Exactly.

11:03.098 --> 11:05.432
So I'm hoping
that he made some notes

11:05.468 --> 11:06.767
about serving the warrant,
you know?

11:06.802 --> 11:08.669
Maybe even something
about Sanderson.

11:08.704 --> 11:11.472
Okay, but these are
all covered in blood.

11:11.507 --> 11:12.506
Yeah, that's why I'm using this.

11:12.541 --> 11:13.707
It's blood detergent.

11:13.742 --> 11:15.576
So, it'll solubilize the blood

11:15.611 --> 11:16.944
and remove it enzymatically.

11:16.979 --> 11:18.612
That's for clothes
and skin, though.

11:18.647 --> 11:20.447
Wouldn't it destroy
the ink that Sweets used

11:20.483 --> 11:21.882
to write the notes?
Absolutely.

11:21.917 --> 11:23.851
But as long as I don't
swell the paper,

11:23.886 --> 11:25.953
it should leave the impression
of the stylus.

11:25.988 --> 11:27.988
Which I could then read

11:28.023 --> 11:30.090
using electrostatic detection.

11:30.125 --> 11:32.326
That is the plan.

11:36.465 --> 11:39.233
I'm thinking Sanderson sends
someone to meet Emory

11:39.268 --> 11:40.968
to get the documents.

11:41.003 --> 11:42.803
And that person kills
Emory and uses

11:42.838 --> 11:44.438
the bullet's entry wound
to obscure the act.

11:44.473 --> 11:47.407
I couldn't get a judge
to reissue the warrant.

11:47.443 --> 11:48.443
What?!

11:48.477 --> 11:49.977
Why?!
Sanderson said

11:50.012 --> 11:51.512
because he already complied,

11:51.547 --> 11:52.946
he doesn't have the requested

11:52.982 --> 11:54.047
documents anymore.

11:54.083 --> 11:55.083
That's because

11:55.117 --> 11:56.316
he killed Sweets

11:56.352 --> 11:57.584
and he took them.

11:57.620 --> 11:59.119
Until you find
something concrete,

11:59.154 --> 12:00.654
we can't touch Sanderson.

12:00.689 --> 12:03.690
And his lawyers told my boss

12:03.726 --> 12:05.826
Sanderson is prepared to spend

12:05.861 --> 12:07.227
whatever it takes

12:07.263 --> 12:09.196
to keep the DOJ off his back.

12:09.231 --> 12:10.364
Oh, right, and you're telling me

12:10.399 --> 12:11.331
that doesn't raise a red flag?

12:11.367 --> 12:12.566
It makes me sick,<i> Cherie,</i>

12:12.601 --> 12:13.567
but that's how the world works.

12:13.602 --> 12:15.736
Not my world.

12:21.677 --> 12:24.678
I used an ESDA scan to pick up
the indentations

12:24.713 --> 12:27.014
left behind by the stylus
of the pen.

12:31.220 --> 12:32.519
"Oooder"?

12:32.555 --> 12:34.288
"Cooper."

12:34.323 --> 12:35.656
Lance smushed
his letters together

12:35.691 --> 12:36.990
'cause he wrote so fast.

12:37.026 --> 12:39.860
Because the ideas
just poured out of him.

12:39.895 --> 12:41.962
"Cooper, defiant,
frightened."

12:41.997 --> 12:43.397
It makes sense

12:43.432 --> 12:44.765
that Cooper would wait
until he was dying

12:44.800 --> 12:46.533
before he stood up
to the blackmailers.

12:46.569 --> 12:47.601
"Sanderson,

12:47.636 --> 12:49.336
"believer, powerful...

12:49.371 --> 12:50.737
acolyte."

12:50.773 --> 12:52.039
And then a bunch
of question marks.

12:52.074 --> 12:53.206
Acolyte.

12:53.242 --> 12:54.541
Acolyte is a follower.

12:54.577 --> 12:56.009
Did you see the cross?

12:56.045 --> 12:58.278
Maybe he's saying
he's religious.

12:58.314 --> 13:00.180
You think this whole thing
could be a cult?

13:03.152 --> 13:05.419
Daisy, what is it?

13:07.323 --> 13:09.289
"Seeley, Seeley, Seeley."

13:10.659 --> 13:13.293
It's what Lance wanted
to name the baby.

13:20.502 --> 13:22.502
Where did you go, Booth?

13:22.538 --> 13:24.171
You know, you...

13:24.206 --> 13:26.873
you can't just run away...

13:28.744 --> 13:31.011
Where did you get those?
Well, they took

13:31.046 --> 13:32.312
all my weapons when
they arrested me,

13:32.348 --> 13:34.848
so I just went and
I replaced them.

13:34.883 --> 13:36.550
Nothing wrong with that, right?

13:37.953 --> 13:39.386
You did this legally?

13:39.421 --> 13:41.221
You know what?
We need protection.

13:42.424 --> 13:44.992
What are you planning
to do, Booth?

13:45.027 --> 13:46.718
Don't ask about things you don't
need to know about, all right?

13:46.741 --> 13:47.527
What?

13:47.529 --> 13:49.396
You don't think I need to know
if you intend to kill a man?!

13:49.431 --> 13:51.064
We can't get to Sanderson,
all right?

13:51.100 --> 13:52.899
He's already killed Sweets!

13:52.935 --> 13:55.235
It's only a matter of time
before he comes for us again!

13:55.270 --> 13:56.703
So you're gonna kill him
on a hunch? Because that's

13:56.739 --> 13:58.205
all it is now, Booth.
Really?

13:58.240 --> 13:59.640
Look at the evidence!
Uh, I have!

13:59.675 --> 14:01.475
There's nothing, Booth.
Not yet!

14:01.510 --> 14:03.977
Stop! I don't want to talk
about this anymore. We're done!

14:04.013 --> 14:06.246
Then you are on your own
because I don't want to be

14:06.281 --> 14:08.849
connected to any part
of this... or you.

14:08.884 --> 14:11.351
Who you are now, it's...

14:11.387 --> 14:13.453
you're not someone
I want in my life!

14:13.489 --> 14:15.222
In my daughter's life.

14:15.257 --> 14:17.257
All right, do you have any
idea what you're saying?!

14:17.292 --> 14:19.292
Yes! I always know
what I'm saying.

14:19.328 --> 14:21.161
Enjoy your new house!
Oh, great!

14:21.196 --> 14:22.262
Okay, that's fine!
What are you gonna do, huh?

14:22.297 --> 14:23.430
You're just gonna
run away now?

14:23.465 --> 14:25.165
Just leave me here?!

14:25.200 --> 14:28.168
Booth, you are the one
who's running away!

14:28.203 --> 14:31.338
You're running away from
everything you believe in! Why?

14:31.373 --> 14:33.940
Because it's not going
the way you want it to?

14:33.976 --> 14:36.009
Because it's
too difficult for you?

14:36.045 --> 14:39.012
What kind of man
does that make you, huh?

14:39.048 --> 14:41.548
How will you face
your God if you...

14:41.583 --> 14:44.818
kill an innocent man?

14:44.853 --> 14:46.720
Is your faith in him so weak?

14:46.755 --> 14:48.855
Your faith in...

14:48.891 --> 14:51.625
in me?

14:55.264 --> 14:56.930
You're a good man, Booth.

14:56.965 --> 14:59.332
Don't let them take that away!

14:59.368 --> 15:01.835
Because that really
will be the death of you.

15:05.708 --> 15:08.909
I just want this to stop.

15:14.183 --> 15:17.350
I want this to stop.

15:17.386 --> 15:19.920
It will.

15:22.091 --> 15:23.724
Faith.

15:25.527 --> 15:28.061
Faith.

15:36.365 --> 15:39.032
Ms. Wick?

15:39.803 --> 15:41.904
Have you been here all night?

15:41.939 --> 15:43.837
I couldn't be alone
in that apartment.

15:43.837 --> 15:45.570
So I came here.

15:45.605 --> 15:49.173
I thought maybe Lance could
give us some more help.

15:49.209 --> 15:52.110
Dr. Edison and I have already
determined

15:52.145 --> 15:54.846
that there's no more
to be learned from his remains.

15:54.881 --> 15:57.081
I disagree.

15:57.117 --> 15:59.417
Did you notice
the remodeled talar dome

15:59.452 --> 16:01.452
fracture to his foot?

16:01.488 --> 16:03.488
Lance must've played
soccer as a kid.

16:03.523 --> 16:04.989
I didn't know that.

16:05.025 --> 16:08.026
Yes. Neither did I.

16:08.061 --> 16:10.395
Or these.

16:10.430 --> 16:14.299
Remodeled fractures to
his left radius and ulna.

16:14.334 --> 16:17.669
I should leave you alone.

16:17.704 --> 16:19.370
Please don't go.

16:22.242 --> 16:25.543
You're the only one
who can see him like I can.

16:25.578 --> 16:27.979
It's like we can have
one last conversation.

16:36.589 --> 16:38.756
A left radius and ulna

16:38.792 --> 16:41.626
indicate fractures
that happened

16:41.661 --> 16:45.196
about 20 years ago.

16:45.231 --> 16:47.265
He fell out
of a tree house.

16:47.300 --> 16:48.566
He said he was so excited,

16:48.601 --> 16:50.168
he lost his balance

16:50.203 --> 16:53.137
on the rope ladder,
and splat.

16:55.475 --> 16:59.610
Extended articular
facets on the joints

16:59.646 --> 17:02.680
of the metacarpals.

17:02.716 --> 17:06.050
I forgot how proficient
he was at the piano.

17:07.587 --> 17:11.055
He played for the baby
every night.

17:13.126 --> 17:16.527
Daisy, do you have family?

17:16.563 --> 17:18.563
Is...? Perhaps they could...?

17:18.598 --> 17:20.397
Here, Dr. Brennan.

17:20.433 --> 17:22.867
This is my family.

17:22.902 --> 17:25.837
I'll be fine here.

17:28.575 --> 17:31.109
Everyone seems to think

17:31.144 --> 17:33.945
that solving
Cooper's murder will lead

17:33.980 --> 17:36.481
to the person that ordered
Lance's murder.

17:36.516 --> 17:38.383
Yes.

17:38.418 --> 17:41.352
Then I'll get Cooper's bones
out of the freezer.

17:41.388 --> 17:44.922
They should be stable enough now
that you can take samples.

17:49.029 --> 17:50.762
What are you doing?

17:50.797 --> 17:52.397
Whoa.

17:52.432 --> 17:54.132
And hello to you, too, suit.

17:54.167 --> 17:55.333
Regulations will be happy.

17:55.368 --> 17:57.068
Yeah. Well,
I'm moving on.

17:57.103 --> 17:59.470
Right, well, there's a lot
to do, so what do you have here?

17:59.506 --> 18:01.739
Right, uh, all of this is from
Bethesda Presbyterian Hospital.

18:01.775 --> 18:03.408
Visitor logs, security tapes...

18:03.443 --> 18:05.243
Security guard said
that Hoover was involved.

18:05.278 --> 18:07.078
If Hoover was involved,
this went back

18:07.113 --> 18:09.047
a lot longer
than 16 years ago.

18:09.082 --> 18:10.948
We're gonna look
at every business

18:10.984 --> 18:12.383
that Sanderson
was involved with.

18:12.419 --> 18:14.218
I don't care
if he was 15 years old

18:14.254 --> 18:15.953
and he was working
at a donut shop.

18:15.989 --> 18:18.256
Find any excuse
to reissue a warrant.

18:18.291 --> 18:19.757
Nice.

18:21.694 --> 18:23.194
Yes, that will be perfect.

18:23.229 --> 18:24.629
How soon can I pick them up?

18:24.664 --> 18:26.464
Excuse me.

18:26.499 --> 18:28.132
Even better.

18:28.168 --> 18:30.835
Okay, well, I look
forward to your call.

18:30.870 --> 18:31.936
Thanks.

18:31.971 --> 18:33.337
Dr. Brennan?

18:33.373 --> 18:34.872
I need a laser microtome

18:34.908 --> 18:37.975
to complete my
immunohistological study

18:38.011 --> 18:40.178
of Cooper's bones.

18:40.213 --> 18:42.313
The request is being denied
without your signature.

18:42.348 --> 18:43.981
You're gonna slice up
the few remaining bones

18:44.017 --> 18:45.550
we have of Cooper's?

18:45.585 --> 18:46.951
It's the only
thing left to do.

18:46.986 --> 18:48.219
The one place we haven't

18:48.254 --> 18:50.288
thoroughly examined
is his marrow.

18:50.323 --> 18:52.957
Okay. Well, I will give you...

18:54.527 --> 18:56.894
Oh, excuse me.

18:56.930 --> 18:59.664
Dr. Saroyan.

18:59.699 --> 19:01.799
You can e-mail me
the different options.

19:01.835 --> 19:04.235
Thank you. Bye.

19:04.270 --> 19:06.137
I am sorry. Where were we?

19:06.172 --> 19:08.106
If you have something
more important to do

19:08.141 --> 19:09.507
than find Cooper's killer...

19:09.542 --> 19:12.043
No. But I...

19:18.084 --> 19:19.650
I'm...

19:19.686 --> 19:22.887
planning Sweets' funeral.

19:24.524 --> 19:26.624
Oh.

19:26.659 --> 19:28.559
He had no immediate family
other than us.

19:28.595 --> 19:31.496
And since I have
no more flesh to examine,

19:31.531 --> 19:35.133
I figured this would be
a good use of my time.

19:35.168 --> 19:36.834
Do you disagree?

19:36.870 --> 19:38.035
No.

19:38.071 --> 19:40.638
I'm sorry.

19:42.275 --> 19:43.875
Okay. I'm...

19:43.910 --> 19:45.076
gonna give you this.

19:45.111 --> 19:46.811
It's a blanket authorization,

19:46.846 --> 19:49.847
so you shouldn't have
any more... problems.

19:49.883 --> 19:51.883
Is there anything I can do?

19:51.918 --> 19:53.184
There is.

19:53.219 --> 19:56.154
Find out who's behind this.

20:05.932 --> 20:07.899
So, using your theory,

20:07.934 --> 20:11.235
which is actually
Dr. Gerald Karp's cell theory,

20:11.271 --> 20:13.838
the conspiracy
is taking the shape

20:13.873 --> 20:16.874
of a living,
growing organism.

20:16.910 --> 20:18.009
God, I love you.

20:18.044 --> 20:19.744
Well, you can love me later.

20:19.779 --> 20:22.046
Here... we have Cooper.

20:22.081 --> 20:23.714
The cell from which
all the rest grew.

20:23.750 --> 20:25.383
Exactly. We know that Durant

20:25.418 --> 20:27.351
was already linked to him
because he falsified

20:27.387 --> 20:28.819
his medical reports.

20:28.855 --> 20:30.821
That's right.
We also know that Sanderson

20:30.857 --> 20:33.291
is linked to Cooper because
a chemical that Sanderson

20:33.326 --> 20:35.593
manufactured killed Cooper.
Right.

20:35.628 --> 20:38.062
So I ran facial recognition

20:38.097 --> 20:40.965
and data searches
on all three of them.

20:45.738 --> 20:47.605
Durant and Cooper!

20:47.640 --> 20:50.908
I found 11 conferences
where Durant and Cooper

20:50.944 --> 20:52.843
were both listed as attendees.

20:52.879 --> 20:55.213
<i>Nothing pisses me off</i>
<i>more than being lied to,</i>

20:55.248 --> 20:56.747
<i>and you lied to me twice.</i>

20:56.783 --> 20:58.683
Howard and I
had a connection.

20:58.718 --> 20:59.784
We were both being blackmailed.

20:59.819 --> 21:00.885
We'd both been promoted because

21:00.920 --> 21:02.253
of the favors that we'd done.

21:02.288 --> 21:04.488
Did both of you talk
about Hugo Sanderson?

21:05.825 --> 21:07.625
Doc, listen to me--
I want a name.

21:07.660 --> 21:10.127
Or I'm gonna charge you
with obstruction of justice.

21:11.297 --> 21:13.164
Howard was the only one

21:13.199 --> 21:15.533
who had the courage
to stand up and say, "no more."

21:15.568 --> 21:17.535
Look what happened to him.

21:17.570 --> 21:19.870
Look, you know what?
We can protect you.

21:19.906 --> 21:21.138
No, you can't.

21:21.174 --> 21:22.340
Yes, we can.

21:22.375 --> 21:25.343
Or do you prefer
living a life like this?

21:27.180 --> 21:29.447
What else do you have in there?

21:31.317 --> 21:33.184
No, I don't know a Sanderson.

21:33.219 --> 21:35.019
I never heard
that name mentioned.

21:35.054 --> 21:36.787
This is who I dealt with.

21:36.823 --> 21:38.189
He-he's a lot older here,

21:38.224 --> 21:40.224
but this is the one
who came to me and to Cooper.

21:40.260 --> 21:41.492
Jerold Norsky?

21:41.527 --> 21:43.094
I hope you meant it

21:43.129 --> 21:44.929
when you said
you could protect me.

21:44.964 --> 21:47.698
Because I think I just signed
my death warrant.

21:51.226 --> 21:54.027
Compare each slice
for anomalies in the marrow.

21:54.061 --> 21:55.261
They could be subtle.

21:55.296 --> 21:56.729
Or not.

21:56.764 --> 21:59.164
This section
of Cooper's marrow...

21:59.200 --> 22:00.566
the cellular makeup...

22:00.601 --> 22:03.936
I've never seen
anything like it before.

22:03.971 --> 22:06.372
Neither have I.

22:06.407 --> 22:08.340
Is this from the anterior
aspect of the C-7?

22:08.376 --> 22:09.842
Yes, it was
in close proximity

22:09.877 --> 22:11.977
to where the needle
punctured the periosteum.

22:12.013 --> 22:14.513
Something appears
to have altered

22:14.548 --> 22:17.082
the stromal cells and
the extracellular matrix.

22:17.118 --> 22:18.784
Looks like the start
of a tumor.

22:18.819 --> 22:20.552
Could it be extra blast cells
from the cancer?

22:20.588 --> 22:22.521
It's not the
leukemia.

22:22.556 --> 22:24.556
And the cimetidine
used to kill him

22:24.592 --> 22:26.325
wouldn't cause
cellular growth.

22:26.360 --> 22:29.695
It's unlike
any cell growth I've seen.

22:29.730 --> 22:31.263
Look at the injection site.

22:31.299 --> 22:32.564
Whatever caused this

22:32.600 --> 22:33.966
happened when
he was injected

22:34.001 --> 22:35.034
with the cimetidine.

22:35.069 --> 22:36.335
And the cells
kept growing

22:36.370 --> 22:38.304
while he was in the
coma before he died.

22:38.339 --> 22:39.838
Have Cam perform
a DNA panel

22:39.874 --> 22:41.807
to determine how the
cells were altered.

22:41.842 --> 22:43.709
Perhaps we can get
a clearer picture

22:43.744 --> 22:45.778
from additional
sectioning.

22:48.015 --> 22:50.282
I'm sorry that I had to leave
last time that I was here.

22:50.318 --> 22:52.584
I don't know if you remember
who I am. I'm Special Agent...

22:52.620 --> 22:55.187
Booth.

22:55.222 --> 22:56.655
I know who you are.

22:56.691 --> 23:00.159
FBI, just like you were.

23:00.194 --> 23:02.461
I still have a few questions
about Mr. Sanderson.

23:02.496 --> 23:04.096
I can't help you.

23:04.131 --> 23:05.497
But last time, you told me

23:05.533 --> 23:07.333
that Hoover recruited you
to work with him.

23:09.270 --> 23:10.903
I don't recall that.

23:10.938 --> 23:13.472
Someone got to you, didn't they?

23:13.507 --> 23:17.376
Someone got to you since last
time I was here-- who was it?

23:19.213 --> 23:21.547
I'm tired. Want to take a nap.

23:21.582 --> 23:24.483
Can you take me
back to my room?

23:24.518 --> 23:26.251
Who was it?
Who got to you?

23:26.287 --> 23:28.053
Who was it?

23:28.089 --> 23:30.389
You telling me you can sleep
well, knowing what you've done?

23:30.424 --> 23:32.958
Yes. Very well.

23:32.994 --> 23:34.860
When you joined the Bureau,
you took an oath

23:34.895 --> 23:36.929
to protect and to defend
this country.

23:36.964 --> 23:41.500
And that, Agent Booth,
is what I have always done.

23:48.109 --> 23:50.876
Damn. Hoover.

23:50.911 --> 23:52.378
It's really true.

23:52.413 --> 23:54.847
But all his personal records
were destroyed when he died.

23:54.882 --> 23:56.115
No way anyone
gets their hands

23:56.150 --> 23:57.916
on that much information
and destroys it.

23:57.952 --> 23:59.918
Well, it's actually
the opposite.

23:59.954 --> 24:02.421
Whoever Hoover passed them to
added to them over the years.

24:02.456 --> 24:03.956
So, Sanderson couldn't
be the direct heir.

24:03.991 --> 24:06.025
I mean, there's not a
strong enough connection

24:06.060 --> 24:07.559
between him
and Hoover.

24:07.595 --> 24:11.130
The question mark is the person
who inherited the files.

24:11.165 --> 24:12.998
Th-That's the spoke
in the wheel.

24:13.034 --> 24:15.034
Yeah, Hoover had to trust
him above all others.

24:15.069 --> 24:17.069
That's what Sweets
meant in his notes

24:17.104 --> 24:18.537
about passion
and commitment.

24:18.572 --> 24:20.072
Oh!

24:20.107 --> 24:21.507
It was, uh...

24:21.542 --> 24:23.709
Damn, what's his name?
It was, um...

24:23.744 --> 24:26.178
Wait, you weren't even born
when Hoover died.

24:26.213 --> 24:28.280
No, n-n-no, I'm a history freak
when it comes to the Bureau.

24:28.315 --> 24:29.982
Figured I should know about
the place I work. Uh...

24:30.017 --> 24:31.884
What movies have
you seen lately?

24:31.919 --> 24:34.420
What? We're trying to destroy a
shadow government here, Aubrey.

24:34.455 --> 24:36.388
Yeah, yeah. But if I'm
distracted by something else,

24:36.424 --> 24:37.823
it'll come to me--
it's how the brain works.

24:37.858 --> 24:39.391
I don't know why, but, uh...

24:39.427 --> 24:41.427
<i>Ice Age.</i>
'Cause we have a kid.

24:41.462 --> 24:43.128
Don't need a kid.
I love all those films.

24:43.164 --> 24:44.797
<i>Rio's</i> pretty awesome, too.

24:44.832 --> 24:47.299
Oh, but the one that you should
really see... Wilson!

24:47.334 --> 24:48.734
Desmond Wilson!

24:48.769 --> 24:50.736
L-Look him up
in the Bureau database.

24:53.274 --> 24:55.240
Okay, yeah.
He was one of Hoover's aides.

24:55.276 --> 24:57.576
It says that he retired in...

24:57.611 --> 24:58.977
Yeah, a couple of months

24:59.013 --> 25:00.779
before the files were supposed
to be destroyed.

25:00.815 --> 25:02.881
You don't work for a man
your whole life

25:02.917 --> 25:05.617
and then disappear when his life
work's going to be ruined.

25:05.653 --> 25:07.586
Look what year Wilson died.

25:08.622 --> 25:10.189
16 years ago.

25:10.224 --> 25:11.890
That's the same year as Cooper.

25:11.926 --> 25:13.625
Hey, the timing fits.

25:13.661 --> 25:15.141
But if he was retired
from the Bureau,

25:15.162 --> 25:16.695
how would he have access
to the files?

25:16.730 --> 25:17.930
After 40 years there,

25:17.965 --> 25:20.165
I'm sure he kept
a couple of keys.

25:23.437 --> 25:25.170
<i> Desmond Wilson</i>
<i>lived in the same house</i>

25:25.206 --> 25:28.173
between the time he
retired and when he died.

25:28.209 --> 25:30.209
Makes sense. Might explain
why it's been empty ever since.

25:30.244 --> 25:31.844
He was renting,

25:31.879 --> 25:33.579
so I'm checking who has
the title to the place.

25:33.614 --> 25:36.548
Where did you get
this car, anyway?

25:36.584 --> 25:38.016
From a British toddler?

25:38.052 --> 25:39.151
Excuse me.

25:39.186 --> 25:40.385
This baby is a classic.

25:40.421 --> 25:42.087
People think calling
something classic

25:42.123 --> 25:43.722
makes you forget
that it's junk.

25:43.757 --> 25:45.491
But hey, enjoy.

25:45.526 --> 25:48.293
So a week after Hoover
died, Wilson filed a permit

25:48.329 --> 25:49.962
to build a fallout
shelter on the property.

25:49.997 --> 25:51.630
It could have been
used for storage.

25:51.665 --> 25:54.199
There won't be any files there.
Wilson was a pro.

25:54.235 --> 25:57.469
But that's why I'm riding
in your bumper car.

25:57.505 --> 25:59.538
They tell me
you're a genius.

25:59.573 --> 26:01.340
You got that right.

26:01.375 --> 26:04.209
Suspension needs
a little work.

26:08.382 --> 26:12.618
It's just weird that this house
stayed empty for 16 years.

26:12.653 --> 26:14.653
Yeah. Well, lucky for us,
cleanup crews back then

26:14.688 --> 26:16.455
didn't have what it takes
to fool me.

26:16.490 --> 26:17.756
Check this out.

26:17.791 --> 26:19.358
Great. Confetti.

26:19.393 --> 26:20.692
What, did they throw a party?

26:20.728 --> 26:22.394
No, ye of little faith.

26:22.429 --> 26:23.429
Look at this.

26:23.464 --> 26:25.330
Now, it's only a partial,

26:25.366 --> 26:28.534
but it looks like part
of a five and a zero.

26:28.569 --> 26:31.170
This paper is watermarked
from 1950.

26:32.339 --> 26:34.006
We're going to need
more than that.

26:34.041 --> 26:37.776
It could be any sheet of paper
from the '50s.

26:37.811 --> 26:39.678
That is not how you talk
to a genius.

26:39.713 --> 26:41.713
Hold up.

26:41.749 --> 26:44.783
There's something wrapped
around the foot of the bed.

26:50.257 --> 26:51.557
Oh.

26:51.592 --> 26:53.592
It's just a piece of wire.

26:53.627 --> 26:54.793
Let me see that.

26:58.332 --> 26:59.631
Oh, no.

26:59.667 --> 27:02.601
No, it is so much more.

27:02.636 --> 27:05.003
This is part
of an old wire recorder.

27:05.039 --> 27:07.673
This could prove that
Hoover's files were kept here.

27:07.708 --> 27:09.341
Why would someone
leave it behind?

27:09.376 --> 27:10.609
I don't know.

27:10.644 --> 27:12.177
They either missed it

27:12.213 --> 27:15.247
or thought no one would ever
be able to play it.

27:18.118 --> 27:22.020
So, in 1944, the U.S. Army used
wire recorders such as this

27:22.056 --> 27:25.224
to record fake information
to confuse German spies.

27:25.259 --> 27:27.059
Dr. Hodgins, please tell me
you put in

27:27.094 --> 27:28.760
a proper requisition
for this

27:28.796 --> 27:30.462
and didn't steal it
from the exhibit.

27:30.497 --> 27:32.064
Your signature gave me
blanket approval

27:32.099 --> 27:33.699
for all requisitions.

27:33.734 --> 27:34.933
Thank you
again.

27:34.969 --> 27:36.668
Okay, we're almost done.

27:36.704 --> 27:38.971
That old piece of wire
can actually be played?

27:39.006 --> 27:41.506
Hopefully. I froze it, turning
it into a superconductor,

27:41.542 --> 27:43.809
which restored
the last magnetic charge.

27:43.844 --> 27:44.943
Hopefully.

27:44.979 --> 27:45.979
Okay.

27:45.980 --> 27:48.113
Here we go.

27:48.148 --> 27:50.382
I will not just ignore
the introduction

27:50.417 --> 27:52.517
of offensive weapons into Cuba.
Make that very clear

27:52.553 --> 27:53.652
in the statement.

27:53.687 --> 27:54.953
Yes, Mr. President.

27:54.989 --> 27:56.321
That's all for now.

27:56.357 --> 27:57.623
Whoa, that is JFK talking

27:57.658 --> 27:58.957
about the Cuban missile crisis.

27:58.993 --> 28:00.959
- Shh!
- Alice.

28:00.995 --> 28:02.394
Stay back a moment, please.

28:02.429 --> 28:04.463
Of course, Mr. President.

28:04.498 --> 28:06.632
You're looking
very lovely this morning.

28:06.667 --> 28:08.433
Thank you, Mr. President.

28:08.469 --> 28:10.502
I've been waiting
for this moment all day.

28:10.537 --> 28:12.337
Why don't I take off my...

28:12.373 --> 28:14.006
Wilson did have Hoover's files.

28:14.041 --> 28:16.441
They were not destroyed
with Hoover's death.

28:20.944 --> 28:22.710
<i>This office always did</i>

28:22.746 --> 28:24.257
look better with
you in it,<i> Cher.</i>

28:24.258 --> 28:25.824
Warms my
little heart.

28:25.859 --> 28:28.193
So, what have you got
for your favorite girl?

28:28.228 --> 28:29.828
Okay, listen to me.
After Hoover's death,

28:29.830 --> 28:32.197
Desmond Wilson moved
the blackmail files

28:32.232 --> 28:34.066
to a fallout shelter
where he was living.

28:34.101 --> 28:36.768
So, Hoover's files were
stored in Wilson's place?

28:36.804 --> 28:38.904
It wasn't exactly his place.

28:38.939 --> 28:41.540
Right, the property belonged to
a Burdett Property Management.

28:41.575 --> 28:43.408
And now you're gonna tell me

28:43.444 --> 28:46.812
Burdett Property is a holding
company owned by Sanderson.

28:46.847 --> 28:47.811
She's good.

28:47.835 --> 28:49.615
You've just scratched
the surface, junior.

28:49.616 --> 28:51.083
We have
a connection now

28:51.118 --> 28:53.585
between Sanderson, Wilson
and the blackmail files.

28:53.620 --> 28:56.655
Right? Let me bring Sanderson
in, and I can squeeze this guy.

28:56.690 --> 28:59.224
Sorry,<i> Cher,</i> but all you've
established is a link

28:59.259 --> 29:01.159
between a landlord and his tenant.
Oh, come on.

29:01.195 --> 29:02.394
We've done more with less.

29:02.429 --> 29:03.929
Not against someone
like Sanderson.

29:03.964 --> 29:05.230
Sanderson is gonna be looking

29:05.265 --> 29:06.932
for any kind of opening now.

29:08.068 --> 29:10.268
So don't give him one.

29:15.976 --> 29:17.743
<i> Where did you get</i>
<i>all this stuff?</i>

29:17.778 --> 29:20.278
I had to go through the archived
files at the Bureau.

29:20.314 --> 29:23.348
Like, real paper files
in the record room.

29:23.383 --> 29:24.983
That's why
I'm so hungry.

29:26.186 --> 29:27.619
Right, s-so is there
a direct connection

29:27.654 --> 29:28.820
between Sanderson
and Wilson?

29:28.856 --> 29:30.722
Not that I saw.

29:30.758 --> 29:32.290
Wait, we had
flight records.

29:32.326 --> 29:36.161
And appointment books,
calendars, utility bills...

29:36.196 --> 29:37.896
I figured I should
just grab everything.

29:37.931 --> 29:39.297
No, that's good.
This is, this is good.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.700
Because we can
probably find somewhere

29:41.735 --> 29:43.435
where these two actually
crossed paths, right?

29:43.470 --> 29:47.939
Cam found foreign DNA
in Cooper's marrow.

29:47.975 --> 29:49.474
Wait, from a
transplant?

29:49.510 --> 29:50.742
He never had one.

29:50.778 --> 29:52.344
I think it's from the assailant.

29:52.379 --> 29:54.513
He scraped himself
during the struggle

29:54.548 --> 29:57.315
and then accidentally injected
his DNA into Cooper

29:57.351 --> 29:58.416
without knowing it.

29:58.452 --> 29:59.718
My God.

29:59.753 --> 30:01.419
The cells kept growing

30:01.455 --> 30:04.089
while Cooper was in a coma,
formed a small tumor.

30:04.124 --> 30:05.557
Can you match the DNA?

30:05.592 --> 30:08.193
No. It's not
in the system.

30:08.228 --> 30:10.095
Have you not
eaten today?

30:10.130 --> 30:12.364
A car's got to
have fuel, right?

30:13.267 --> 30:14.432
Whoa.

30:14.468 --> 30:16.434
Why is Glen Durant
in this photo?

30:16.470 --> 30:18.570
That's not Durant.
That's, uh, Desmond Wilson.

30:18.605 --> 30:21.039
That's the guy that Hoover
had passed the files down to.

30:21.074 --> 30:23.842
Not him, the child.

30:23.877 --> 30:25.076
Note the prominent glabella.

30:25.112 --> 30:26.311
The jutting supraorbital torus.

30:26.346 --> 30:28.180
This is Glen Durant,

30:28.215 --> 30:29.948
the physician
who treated Cooper.

30:29.983 --> 30:33.084
Wait a second, this is a picture
from his second marriage.

30:33.120 --> 30:34.753
He didn't have any kids.

30:34.788 --> 30:38.089
Which means that Glen Durant
is Wilson's stepson.

30:38.125 --> 30:40.125
What, are you sure?
She's always sure when she speaks.

30:40.160 --> 30:42.394
Listen, that's...
This fits. This all fits.

30:42.429 --> 30:45.697
So, Hoover passes on the files
to a believer, Wilson, right?

30:45.732 --> 30:48.099
And Wilson, he passes it on
to his stepson

30:48.135 --> 30:50.135
who he grooms for years.

30:50.170 --> 30:51.770
And Durant uses
his position as a doctor

30:51.805 --> 30:53.805
to look into
patients' medical records

30:53.841 --> 30:56.541
and collect even more evidence
to blackmail people with.

30:56.577 --> 30:57.742
It's like Cooper's hit-and-run.

30:57.778 --> 30:59.778
The operation continues
and grows.

30:59.813 --> 31:01.513
So, I should have known this.

31:01.548 --> 31:03.381
Everything was pointing
to Sanderson. It was too clean.

31:03.417 --> 31:05.317
Durant set Sanderson up
as the fall guy.

31:05.352 --> 31:07.686
The DNA that you found,
it-it's got to be Durant's.

31:07.721 --> 31:10.755
Even if it is,
he's not in the system.

31:14.228 --> 31:15.527
So, why didn't you

31:15.562 --> 31:17.696
tell us that your father
was Desmond Wilson?

31:17.731 --> 31:20.131
Stepfather.
Why is that important?

31:20.167 --> 31:22.334
Why? Because he passed down
all the files to you.

31:22.369 --> 31:23.735
Hoover's files and whatever else

31:23.770 --> 31:25.203
that he added.

31:25.239 --> 31:26.671
I don't know
what you're talking about.

31:26.707 --> 31:28.573
When you were at the E.R.,
you had access

31:28.609 --> 31:29.708
to information
you could use--

31:29.743 --> 31:31.076
Cooper's hit-and-run.

31:31.111 --> 31:32.744
There's
probably others.

31:32.779 --> 31:34.613
We're pulling
the records now.

31:34.648 --> 31:36.114
I'm sorry, what is it with you?

31:36.149 --> 31:37.382
Are you a patriot like Hoover?

31:37.417 --> 31:38.583
You don't believe in the system?

31:38.619 --> 31:39.885
You think you can do better?

31:39.920 --> 31:42.287
Are we talking politics now?

31:42.322 --> 31:44.623
Do you even know how this system
is supposed to work?

31:44.658 --> 31:46.324
Yeah, I've read
the Constitution.

31:46.360 --> 31:47.759
He's defended it.

31:47.794 --> 31:49.294
He's risked
his life for it.

31:49.329 --> 31:50.929
Okay. Then you know

31:50.964 --> 31:53.598
that the Founding Fathers
had a disdain for democracy.

31:53.634 --> 31:56.334
They thought it was
the equivalent of mob rule.

31:56.370 --> 31:58.470
They believed
in an educated elite,

31:58.505 --> 32:00.538
property owners
who would elect people

32:00.574 --> 32:02.407
like themselves
to run the country,

32:02.442 --> 32:05.810
to govern the masses
as they saw fit.

32:05.846 --> 32:09.314
This country has always been
in danger of losing its footing.

32:09.349 --> 32:11.216
Fortunately, there are still
some people who believe

32:11.251 --> 32:14.119
in the basic principles set
forth by the Founding Fathers.

32:14.154 --> 32:15.720
They believe we have to take

32:15.756 --> 32:17.489
this country back
from the rabble.

32:17.524 --> 32:20.292
Men like Hoover
and my stepfather,

32:20.327 --> 32:22.994
those are the real patriots.

32:23.030 --> 32:25.096
Sounds like a confession to me.

32:25.132 --> 32:26.631
No, not at all, Agent Booth.

32:26.667 --> 32:27.999
That was free speech.

32:28.035 --> 32:30.201
You tried to kill me.
And me.

32:30.237 --> 32:33.004
Well, that's simply absurd.

32:33.040 --> 32:36.241
To set your mind at ease, you're
welcome to investigate me.

32:36.276 --> 32:38.076
Look at my comings and goings.

32:38.111 --> 32:40.045
You don't even need a warrant.
You'll find nothing.

32:40.080 --> 32:42.380
And you killed my friend.

32:42.416 --> 32:44.349
Dr. Sweets.

32:44.384 --> 32:45.984
I read about that.

32:46.019 --> 32:48.520
Perhaps that's why you're being
so unreasonable.

32:48.555 --> 32:50.422
You've suffered
a lot of trauma recently,

32:50.457 --> 32:53.191
defending your idea
of the Constitution.

32:55.128 --> 32:56.361
Booth!

32:56.396 --> 32:58.396
Stop! God.

33:02.202 --> 33:04.469
That's okay,
Dr. Brennan.

33:04.504 --> 33:06.638
I understand his frustration.

33:06.673 --> 33:08.940
You're done.
We'll see.

33:08.976 --> 33:11.676
Again, my condolences
on the loss of your friend.

33:20.473 --> 33:22.906
How can you match Durant's DNA

33:22.907 --> 33:25.171
to the DNA you found
in Cooper's marrow?

33:25.172 --> 33:29.005
Booth's hand had a large sample
of Durant's blood.

33:29.005 --> 33:30.972
He hit him
for the blood sample?

33:31.007 --> 33:32.841
Because that was the
only way to get his DNA.

33:32.876 --> 33:35.243
Brilliant. Too bad we all
couldn't take a swing at him.

33:35.278 --> 33:37.178
Yes. I would've enjoyed that.

33:37.214 --> 33:38.279
So Durant's been running
the conspiracy,

33:38.315 --> 33:39.714
this meek pencil pusher.

33:39.749 --> 33:41.816
Real power has always
been concentrated

33:41.852 --> 33:43.284
in those who are

33:43.320 --> 33:44.986
hidden from the public.
People like

33:45.021 --> 33:47.422
Thomas Cromwell, Gustav Krupp...

33:47.457 --> 33:49.591
And he's been insulated
by computer networks, front men,

33:49.626 --> 33:51.459
layers of people
he probably never even met

33:51.495 --> 33:53.328
but used to keep himself hidden.

33:53.363 --> 33:55.663
And if we can match
his DNA to the tumor

33:55.699 --> 33:58.366
in Cooper's marrow,
we can prove he's the killer.

33:58.401 --> 34:01.736
<i>Even if the DNA is</i>
<i>a match for Durant,</i>

34:01.771 --> 34:04.839
as long as he has his blackmail
files, he can game the system

34:04.875 --> 34:06.207
and walk.

34:06.243 --> 34:08.810
Which is why we have
to find those files.

34:08.844 --> 34:11.411
The physical files.

34:11.447 --> 34:13.947
If we control those,
Durant is finished

34:13.984 --> 34:16.251
and this conspiracy is over.

34:16.286 --> 34:18.553
And how do you propose
to do that,<i> Cher?</i>

34:18.588 --> 34:20.889
With a little help from Sweets.

34:20.924 --> 34:23.591
<i>If Durant was so careful</i>

34:23.627 --> 34:26.694
to insulate himself, why would
he risk killing Cooper himself?

34:26.730 --> 34:28.362
His stepfather
had just died.

34:28.398 --> 34:31.132
He probably didn't know
who he could trust yet.

34:31.167 --> 34:33.601
Sweets always said the beginning
of a criminal career starts

34:33.637 --> 34:36.237
with too much caution
or too much arrogance.

34:36.273 --> 34:38.606
Either way, the killer leaves a clue.

34:38.641 --> 34:40.775
Oh. The results.

34:45.649 --> 34:48.949
Durant's DNA is a match
for the DNA found in the marrow.

34:48.985 --> 34:50.418
He did it.

34:50.453 --> 34:51.985
Durant killed Cooper.

34:52.022 --> 34:54.155
I'll tell Booth.

34:56.592 --> 34:59.394
We already petitioned the judge
for a release from custody.

34:59.429 --> 35:01.329
My client will not be
answering any questions.

35:01.364 --> 35:02.664
What does he have on you?

35:02.699 --> 35:04.032
I beg your pardon?

35:04.067 --> 35:05.067
What does he have on you?

35:05.101 --> 35:06.701
Who is it? What judge?

35:06.736 --> 35:08.469
Is it because he's got

35:08.505 --> 35:10.438
a whole bunch
in his back pocket there?

35:10.473 --> 35:12.473
If you have nothing else...

35:12.509 --> 35:13.989
We have proof he killed
Howard Cooper.

35:14.010 --> 35:15.810
During the struggle
in Cooper's

35:15.845 --> 35:18.112
hospital room,
you must've scratched yourself.

35:18.148 --> 35:20.548
When you were injecting
the toxin into him,

35:20.584 --> 35:22.550
you also injected
some of your own cells

35:22.586 --> 35:24.319
by mistake.

35:24.354 --> 35:26.888
We found your DNA inside Cooper.

35:26.923 --> 35:29.190
It was just like a confession
waiting for us.

35:29.225 --> 35:31.726
Your boss is not gonna get
an early release.

35:31.761 --> 35:33.761
Client.
Sure.

35:33.797 --> 35:35.663
You know, you tried to poison

35:35.699 --> 35:37.632
everything I love
about this country.

35:37.667 --> 35:39.968
But you're just
a pathetic little man

35:40.003 --> 35:42.403
who's gonna die in prison.

35:42.439 --> 35:46.274
And you can't control that,
and that's a promise.

35:52.816 --> 35:54.415
<i>I don't understand.</i>

35:54.451 --> 35:56.117
<i>We can tie Durant</i>

35:56.152 --> 35:57.452
to Cooper's murder. He's going to jail.
No...

35:57.487 --> 35:58.987
Well, he's gonna
blackmail his way

35:59.022 --> 36:00.555
out of jail if we
don't find his files.

36:00.590 --> 36:03.358
Well, his files could be
anywhere, Booth.

36:03.393 --> 36:05.026
Right there.

36:05.061 --> 36:07.695
How will Sweets' notes help?

36:07.731 --> 36:09.197
It's not just notes, okay?

36:09.232 --> 36:11.599
It's the way Sweets
would look at things.

36:11.635 --> 36:13.267
Uh, profile, psychology.

36:13.303 --> 36:14.802
Booth...
No!

36:14.838 --> 36:16.938
We need Sweets now.

36:16.973 --> 36:19.807
The answers are right here.

36:21.378 --> 36:24.245
Cause and effect?

36:24.280 --> 36:26.481
It rules physics, biology. I...

36:26.516 --> 36:30.485
I suppose if we apply it
to human behavior,

36:30.520 --> 36:33.554
we could posit
a rational resolution.

36:33.590 --> 36:35.089
Exactly!

36:35.125 --> 36:36.924
Okay, what-what do we know?
Okay, Durant was devoted

36:36.960 --> 36:38.159
to his stepfather, right?

36:38.194 --> 36:39.694
Yes! Who trusted him!

36:39.729 --> 36:41.295
And Durant must've felt

36:41.331 --> 36:43.097
the weight of that burden

36:43.133 --> 36:44.866
as all potential rulers do.

36:44.901 --> 36:47.735
There's evidence
in the Stuart monarchy,

36:47.771 --> 36:49.604
in the succession
of Popes

36:49.639 --> 36:51.839
in the early Church as well as...
Okay, listen.

36:51.875 --> 36:53.574
We don't have a lot of time.
Wilson...

36:53.610 --> 36:56.010
Wilson and Durant
were true followers.

36:56.046 --> 36:58.713
Yes. They emulated
J. Edgar Hoover.

36:58.748 --> 37:00.748
Sweets implied that, uh, their
devotion was like a religion.

37:00.784 --> 37:02.216
Yes!

37:02.252 --> 37:04.318
Yes! It might be...
There it is!

37:04.354 --> 37:07.422
"Thou shall have no
other God before me."

37:07.457 --> 37:08.723
Right there!
Here you go.

37:08.758 --> 37:10.224
You should really get, like,

37:10.260 --> 37:11.926
a good espresso machine in here.
Aubrey!

37:11.961 --> 37:13.561
Sorry. Okay.

37:13.596 --> 37:16.964
So, well, if Durant saw this
as a religious mission,

37:17.000 --> 37:19.000
then wouldn't the files
just be someplace

37:19.035 --> 37:20.668
that he considered holy?

37:20.704 --> 37:22.637
"Holy"! That's exactly
what Sweets would say!

37:22.672 --> 37:23.938
Okay, Mecca...

37:23.973 --> 37:26.874
Pir-e Sabz, Varanasi--
these are all places

37:26.910 --> 37:28.543
that are revered
by religious sects.

37:28.578 --> 37:31.579
Relics and scriptures
are placed there.

37:31.614 --> 37:34.056
So, to Durant, the files
are his scriptures.

37:34.080 --> 37:34.783
Yes.

37:34.784 --> 37:36.918
You're saying that the-the files
are still in the FBI?

37:36.953 --> 37:38.619
No, no, no. There's no way
they'd be secure here

37:38.655 --> 37:39.954
for 20 years.

37:39.989 --> 37:41.589
It's not the institution
that is holy.

37:41.624 --> 37:44.058
It is the man.
It's J. Edgar Hoover.

37:48.732 --> 37:50.198
Hoover's office.

37:50.233 --> 37:51.566
Wait, Hoover's office

37:51.601 --> 37:53.201
doesn't even exist anymore.

37:53.236 --> 37:55.136
Yes, it does.

38:00.310 --> 38:01.709
This is one of
the Jeffersonian's

38:01.745 --> 38:03.544
most popular exhibits.

38:03.580 --> 38:06.214
Everything in here is either
real or an exact replica.

38:06.249 --> 38:07.782
You were right.

38:07.817 --> 38:10.251
It's-it's right
in Hoover's office.

38:10.286 --> 38:12.086
I mean, this might be
the best day of my life.

38:12.088 --> 38:13.688
- Hide in plain sight.
- Yeah!

38:13.723 --> 38:16.824
He put his digital files
on old punch cards and tape.

38:16.860 --> 38:17.992
Wow.

38:18.027 --> 38:20.962
Everything was right
under our noses.

38:20.997 --> 38:23.498
This is so much more
than we could've imagined.

38:23.533 --> 38:26.033
Everyone just assumed this was
fake, just props in an exhibit.

38:26.069 --> 38:27.702
How did he get this all in here?

38:27.737 --> 38:29.537
He blackmailed
heads of state.

38:29.572 --> 38:32.340
Blackmailing a security guard
would've been a piece of cake.

38:32.375 --> 38:34.142
Lance helped, didn't he?

38:34.177 --> 38:36.410
We couldn't have done this
without him.

38:36.446 --> 38:38.146
Look, Durant can't use
these files now.

38:38.181 --> 38:40.214
And we'll reclassify them
so no one else can, either.

38:40.250 --> 38:43.484
No more extortion,
no more blackmail.

38:43.520 --> 38:44.952
Hey, no more shadow government.

38:44.988 --> 38:46.454
Durant is finished.

38:46.489 --> 38:49.290
It's really over?

38:49.325 --> 38:52.593
Yup. It is really over.

38:53.763 --> 38:57.231
So, I guess it's time
to say good-bye.

39:14.584 --> 39:16.517
It's really
beautiful here.

39:16.553 --> 39:19.687
This is where I told Lance
he was gonna be a father.

39:19.722 --> 39:23.624
We sat here for hours
and planned our future.

39:23.660 --> 39:25.893
Thank you for the pizza.

39:25.929 --> 39:28.396
It was Lance's
favorite food.

39:28.431 --> 39:29.497
No problem.

39:29.532 --> 39:31.766
He would've been so happy

39:31.801 --> 39:33.334
knowing you all were here.

39:33.369 --> 39:36.170
Oh, he knows.

39:36.206 --> 39:38.406
Yeah, I think we
all feel that way.

39:38.441 --> 39:39.807
I don't.

39:39.843 --> 39:41.175
Bones?

39:41.211 --> 39:42.977
But I do believe

39:43.012 --> 39:45.746
Sweets is still with us.

39:45.782 --> 39:47.582
Not in a religious sense,

39:47.617 --> 39:49.750
because the concept of God

39:49.786 --> 39:52.687
is merely a foolish attempt
to explain the unexplainable.

39:52.722 --> 39:54.422
Bones, I don't think
this is the place or the...

39:54.457 --> 39:55.623
It-it's okay.

39:55.658 --> 39:57.425
But in a real sense.

39:57.460 --> 39:58.993
He's here.

39:59.028 --> 40:01.929
Sweets is a part of us.

40:01.965 --> 40:03.898
Our lives...

40:03.933 --> 40:07.034
who we all are
at this moment,

40:07.070 --> 40:09.036
have been shaped
by our relationships

40:09.072 --> 40:11.706
with Sweets.

40:11.741 --> 40:13.808
Well, each of us is like

40:13.843 --> 40:16.878
a delicate equation.

40:16.913 --> 40:18.880
And Sweets was the variable

40:18.915 --> 40:21.182
without which
we wouldn't be who we are.

40:24.888 --> 40:26.821
I might not have married Booth.

40:26.856 --> 40:29.590
Or had Christine.

40:29.626 --> 40:31.125
Daisy certainly

40:31.160 --> 40:34.295
wouldn't be
carrying his child.

40:34.330 --> 40:38.099
We are all who we are
because we knew Sweets.

40:38.134 --> 40:40.334
So, I don't

40:40.370 --> 40:42.336
need a... a God

40:42.372 --> 40:45.139
to praise him or the universe
he sprang from,

40:45.174 --> 40:48.142
because I loved him.

40:49.545 --> 40:52.046
I used to try and
explain love, define it

40:52.081 --> 40:53.948
as the secretion of...

40:53.983 --> 40:57.652
chemicals and hormones.

40:59.822 --> 41:03.791
But I believe now,
remembering Sweets,

41:03.826 --> 41:06.827
seeing what he left us,

41:06.863 --> 41:10.765
that love cannot
be explained by...

41:10.800 --> 41:14.201
science or religion.

41:14.237 --> 41:16.604
It's beyond the mind,

41:16.639 --> 41:18.839
beyond reason.

41:19.909 --> 41:22.276
What I do know--

41:22.312 --> 41:26.013
loving Sweets...

41:30.453 --> 41:32.153
...loving each other,

41:32.188 --> 41:34.555
that's what makes
life worthwhile.

41:37.460 --> 41:39.126
Right now...

41:40.830 --> 41:42.997
...I don't need to know
more than that.

41:43.032 --> 41:45.700
Which is embarrassing coming
from an extremely intelligent,

41:45.735 --> 41:47.301
fact-based person.

42:02.285 --> 42:04.819
I guess it's time.

42:16.733 --> 42:18.632
Wait a second.

42:18.668 --> 42:20.634
One more thing.

42:22.271 --> 42:24.638
Music, right? S...

42:24.674 --> 42:26.273
Sweets had this song, remember?

42:26.309 --> 42:27.341
He had that jam?

42:27.377 --> 42:29.276
It was, uh...

42:29.312 --> 42:32.813

he bought it for a dime ♪

42:32.849 --> 42:36.984
