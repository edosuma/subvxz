WEBVTT

00:08.180 --> 00:10.458
-Whoa!

00:10.493 --> 00:11.390
Whoa!

00:11.425 --> 00:12.564
-Go Shannon!

00:16.602 --> 00:18.087
-Whew!

00:18.121 --> 00:20.365
Agh, ha, ha.

00:20.399 --> 00:21.262
-Uh, my turn.

00:21.297 --> 00:22.436
My turn, my turn.

00:32.618 --> 00:34.206
-Tom, are you all right?

00:34.241 --> 00:35.311
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: Aw, my knee.

00:35.345 --> 00:35.897
RHYDIAN [OFFSCREEN]:
Stay there.

00:35.932 --> 00:37.244
Don't move it.

00:37.278 --> 00:37.485
SHANNON [OFFSCREEN]:
Are you all right?

00:39.522 --> 00:42.318
-Someone's there.

00:42.352 --> 00:43.767
Someone is spying on us.

00:47.426 --> 00:49.118
[music playing]

00:55.262 --> 00:58.506
THEME SONG: A promise that I
keep, I'll never share, I'll

00:58.541 --> 00:59.438
never speak.

00:59.473 --> 01:03.649
To my grave the secret goes.

01:03.684 --> 01:05.134
The beating heart, the
beating heart.

01:05.168 --> 01:07.860
Where mystic creatures
wandered far.

01:07.895 --> 01:11.692
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

01:11.726 --> 01:14.591
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

01:17.905 --> 01:19.700
-This is where he
was standing.

01:19.734 --> 01:22.289
-So he was spying on us.

01:22.323 --> 01:25.326
-How am I supposed to tell
from a few broken twigs?

01:25.361 --> 01:27.501
Come on, lets' get
out of here.

01:30.814 --> 01:33.265
[sniffing]

01:33.300 --> 01:35.267
-It's the same scent.

01:35.302 --> 01:37.373
-Wild wolfblood in the woods.

01:40.410 --> 01:42.171
-Don't you have a big
game on Friday?

01:42.205 --> 01:43.137
-Yeah.

01:43.172 --> 01:44.690
Only the County Cup finals.

01:44.725 --> 01:47.831
And we're playing Barons Mill,
that team we always lose to.

01:47.866 --> 01:49.592
-So your leg won't make
a difference, then?

01:49.626 --> 01:50.731
-Thanks mate.

01:50.765 --> 01:52.215
-Who cares about football?

01:52.250 --> 01:54.562
I want to know who the creep
in the bushes was.

01:54.597 --> 01:56.219
-Probably just a dog walker.

01:56.254 --> 01:57.393
-I didn't see a dog.

01:57.427 --> 01:59.360
-Ah, you've seen her,
too, have you?

01:59.395 --> 02:00.637
-Her?

02:00.672 --> 02:02.191
-Seen who?

02:02.225 --> 02:03.985
-Yeah, the homeless woman that's
been sleeping rough.

02:04.020 --> 02:06.333
She's been seen around the
village these last few nights.

02:09.888 --> 02:10.923
-Oh!

02:10.958 --> 02:11.924
-Liam's the best goalie
we've got.

02:11.959 --> 02:12.822
-Which is saying something?

02:12.856 --> 02:13.823
-We've got a match to win.

02:13.857 --> 02:14.962
Now pull yourselves together.

02:14.996 --> 02:16.550
-What do you mean you're
not coming?

02:16.584 --> 02:19.380
-To watch you kick a piece of
leather around a field?

02:19.415 --> 02:20.657
It's dull.

02:20.692 --> 02:22.659
-Football is so lame, even
Shannon doesn't like it.

02:22.694 --> 02:23.764
-It's the Cup final.

02:23.798 --> 02:25.179
Are you not coming
to support us?

02:25.214 --> 02:27.595
-You lost to Barons Mill
High, last year.

02:27.630 --> 02:28.838
And the year before.

02:28.872 --> 02:30.357
-And there's nothing
lamer than a loser.

02:30.391 --> 02:31.220
-Yeah.

02:31.254 --> 02:32.669
That's why we need you.

02:32.704 --> 02:33.981
The crowd are like the 12th man
on the team, supporting

02:34.015 --> 02:35.189
us, cheering us on.

02:35.224 --> 02:36.017
-What?

02:36.052 --> 02:37.329
You mean like cheer leading?

02:37.364 --> 02:38.296
-No.

02:38.330 --> 02:39.400
No, that's not what I meant.

02:39.435 --> 02:40.505
-It's way more fun
than football.

02:40.539 --> 02:42.852
-Yeah, with costumes
and pom-poms.

02:42.886 --> 02:44.647
We'll be like the stars
of the show.

02:47.684 --> 02:48.823
-Tom.

02:53.794 --> 02:56.210
-If she can hide from us when
she wants, that means, when we

02:56.245 --> 02:57.038
see her--

02:57.073 --> 02:58.557
-It's because she wanted it.

02:58.592 --> 02:59.627
-Go on.

02:59.662 --> 03:00.352
TOM [OFFSCREEN]: Oh, no.

03:00.387 --> 03:01.422
Your window.

03:07.635 --> 03:08.464
-Sam.

03:08.498 --> 03:09.292
-Yeah?

03:09.327 --> 03:10.017
-Go and get Miss Graham.

03:13.469 --> 03:16.403
-All you have to do is stop the
ball going in the goal.

03:16.437 --> 03:17.335
-Football really
isn't my thing.

03:17.369 --> 03:18.474
-Well, just play along, man.

03:22.478 --> 03:23.893
-Didn't you hear what I said?

03:23.927 --> 03:24.756
Stop the ball.

03:24.790 --> 03:26.275
Or you too cool to dive?

03:26.309 --> 03:27.310
-Do it again.

03:27.345 --> 03:29.347
-I don't want to
embarrass you.

03:29.381 --> 03:30.382
-Do it again.

03:30.417 --> 03:31.797
-Jimi, take the penalty.

03:38.701 --> 03:39.460
-Oh!

03:39.495 --> 03:40.668
[clapping]

03:40.703 --> 03:41.635
-What do you think, Miss?

03:41.669 --> 03:43.740
-I think we have a new goalie.

03:43.775 --> 03:44.534
-Yes!

03:44.569 --> 03:45.535
Back in midfield.

03:45.570 --> 03:46.674
-Miss?

03:48.676 --> 03:49.608
-That was really nice.

03:49.643 --> 03:50.506
-Wow!

03:50.540 --> 03:51.438
-We can win the cup now.

03:51.472 --> 03:52.059
We can finally beat them.

04:04.727 --> 04:06.038
[branches cracking]

04:15.738 --> 04:17.084
[footsteps in the leaves]

04:23.366 --> 04:24.747
[footsteps in the leaves]

04:36.034 --> 04:36.828
-Who are you?

04:36.862 --> 04:38.933
What do you want?

04:38.968 --> 04:40.107
-Dwi'n dy fam.

04:43.766 --> 04:46.044
I'm your mother.

04:46.078 --> 04:47.356
-I don't have a--

04:50.531 --> 04:51.670
you can't--

04:53.948 --> 04:55.053
-I am, Rhydian.

04:57.538 --> 04:58.367
I'm your mother.

04:58.401 --> 04:59.540
-No!

05:29.708 --> 05:31.676
-We'll go back to the
rope swing at dusk.

05:31.710 --> 05:36.612
The ground will be damper, so it
will hold her scent better.

05:36.646 --> 05:38.027
Rhydian?

05:38.061 --> 05:41.824
Rhydian, are you
even listening?

05:41.858 --> 05:43.584
-Just forget we ever saw her.

05:43.619 --> 05:45.379
[school bell ringing]

05:45.414 --> 05:46.138
-Rhydian!

05:46.173 --> 05:47.588
-I'm, uh, practicing.

05:56.252 --> 05:57.702
-Ahem.

05:57.736 --> 05:59.635
Who wants to see our routine?

05:59.669 --> 06:00.739
Ready?

06:00.774 --> 06:01.671
OK.

06:01.706 --> 06:03.052
Go, go, Bradlington High.

06:03.086 --> 06:04.778
Kick that ball into the sky.

06:04.812 --> 06:06.020
Beat that awful Barons Mill.

06:06.055 --> 06:08.160
Show them they are
over-the-hill.

06:08.195 --> 06:10.818
Go Bradlington.

06:10.853 --> 06:14.097
[clapping]

06:14.132 --> 06:15.409
-What did you think, Rhydian?

06:17.687 --> 06:20.759
-No, I thought-- yeah,
it's brilliant.

06:20.794 --> 06:22.934
-No, you were great, honestly.

06:28.146 --> 06:29.078
-Right.

06:29.112 --> 06:30.044
Set please.

06:30.079 --> 06:31.183
Free kicks in corners.

06:36.050 --> 06:38.950
Rhydian, get in goal.

06:46.095 --> 06:47.234
Concentrate, Rhydian.

06:53.102 --> 06:54.724
-Wake up, Welshie.

06:54.759 --> 06:55.656
-Jimi.

06:55.691 --> 06:56.968
-Are you taking the mickey?

06:57.002 --> 06:57.934
We give you a place on the
team and you can't

06:57.969 --> 06:58.832
even bother to try.

06:58.866 --> 06:59.522
-All right.

06:59.557 --> 07:00.558
That's enough.

07:00.592 --> 07:02.111
Go and work with
the defenders.

07:02.145 --> 07:03.561
-Good idea, cause with him in
goal we're going to need them.

07:06.218 --> 07:09.498
-A team is only as strong
as it's weakest link.

07:09.532 --> 07:11.603
All we ask is that everyone
does their best.

07:11.638 --> 07:14.675
Is that too much to ask?

07:14.710 --> 07:16.574
Good.

07:16.608 --> 07:17.920
[whistle blows]

07:25.341 --> 07:28.482
-Look, mate, don't even
worry about it, yeah?

07:28.517 --> 07:29.725
Match days are always better.

07:29.759 --> 07:31.036
-You had better be.

07:31.071 --> 07:33.038
-Always the same, loners,
afraid of failure

07:33.073 --> 07:34.281
so they won't try.

07:34.315 --> 07:35.662
-You trying to say I'm
scared of losing?

07:35.696 --> 07:37.008
-I'm saying you're not
team material.

07:37.042 --> 07:38.250
-Fine.

07:38.285 --> 07:39.113
I wouldn't be on your
team if you paid me.

07:47.881 --> 07:49.296
-I'm not going to give
up, you know.

07:49.330 --> 07:50.573
-I know.

07:53.058 --> 07:54.197
We can't talk here.

07:58.650 --> 08:01.515
-You spoke to her?

08:01.550 --> 08:02.551
When?

08:02.585 --> 08:05.554
-Yesterday, when
I walked home.

08:05.588 --> 08:06.727
Maddy, she's my mum.

08:10.835 --> 08:12.768
-What's she doing here now?

08:12.802 --> 08:13.872
-I don't know.

08:13.907 --> 08:14.321
I runaway.

08:14.355 --> 08:15.149
I--

08:15.184 --> 08:16.703
I couldn't talk to her.

08:16.737 --> 08:19.084
She can't just turn
up like this.

08:19.119 --> 08:20.258
She left me in the middle
of nowhere.

08:20.292 --> 08:21.224
I could have died.

08:21.259 --> 08:22.329
What kind of mother does that?

08:22.363 --> 08:24.365
-You don't know what
really happened.

08:24.400 --> 08:26.816
No one does, except her.

08:26.851 --> 08:28.991
So if you want to find
out the truth, you

08:29.025 --> 08:30.613
have to talk to her.

08:30.648 --> 08:32.995
-I know, but I can't.

08:42.383 --> 08:43.626
-Please.

08:55.189 --> 08:56.708
-What are you doing here?

08:56.743 --> 08:58.020
You're in Maddy's territory.

08:58.054 --> 09:00.988
-And what will the tame
wolfbloods do about it?

09:01.023 --> 09:02.369
-All right.

09:02.403 --> 09:03.646
There you go.

09:06.235 --> 09:08.686
Right.

09:08.720 --> 09:10.619
[sniffing]

09:15.865 --> 09:19.904
[choking]

09:19.938 --> 09:20.352
-Come on, love.

09:20.387 --> 09:21.146
Let's go, eh?

09:24.287 --> 09:26.773
-You don't have to be afraid.

09:26.807 --> 09:27.808
-I'm not afraid.

09:27.843 --> 09:28.602
I'm embarrassed.

09:28.637 --> 09:29.154
They're different.

09:29.189 --> 09:31.329
-Different word.

09:31.363 --> 09:34.332
Same human emotion.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.783
-What do you want?

09:36.817 --> 09:37.956
-[foreign language].

09:41.063 --> 09:42.582
My beautiful boy.

09:44.963 --> 09:48.380
-Newsflash, Mum, you're
12 years late.

09:48.415 --> 09:50.141
-I couldn't find you.

09:50.175 --> 09:51.936
I left you safe while
we went hunting.

09:51.970 --> 09:53.282
When I came back, they
were taking you

09:53.316 --> 09:54.904
away in their machines.

09:54.939 --> 09:56.872
-You could have gone
to Social Services.

09:56.906 --> 09:58.080
You could have told them
you were my mum.

09:58.114 --> 09:59.219
-They'd have locked me up.

09:59.253 --> 10:01.048
-Not if you lived as
a human being.

10:01.083 --> 10:04.051
-That's worse than
being locked up.

10:04.086 --> 10:05.156
-Why now?

10:05.190 --> 10:08.090
-I sensed your first
transformation.

10:08.124 --> 10:11.024
Knew it was time for you
to lead the life

10:11.058 --> 10:13.336
you were born for.

10:13.371 --> 10:15.822
-How did you find me?

10:15.856 --> 10:16.995
-[foreign language].

10:21.482 --> 10:27.903
A true wolfblood can always
find their kin.

10:27.937 --> 10:29.111
[laughter]

10:29.145 --> 10:31.976
-Your friend, she's
corrupted you.

10:32.010 --> 10:34.772
Made you tame like them.

10:34.806 --> 10:36.843
-You know nothing
about my life.

10:36.877 --> 10:39.949
-I can see your life,
right here.

10:39.984 --> 10:42.158
-Her pack were here for me,
whilst you were too busy

10:42.193 --> 10:43.159
running wild.

10:43.194 --> 10:44.436
-Ha, ha.

10:44.471 --> 10:45.472
Hey, Bernie, is something
going off in here?

10:45.506 --> 10:47.301
There's a nasty smell about.

10:47.336 --> 10:49.165
I think it's coming
from that table.

10:49.200 --> 10:50.097
-Leave it out, Jimi.

10:50.132 --> 10:51.271
-Yeah, I better be careful.

10:51.305 --> 10:52.134
He might punch me.

10:52.168 --> 10:53.238
But he'd probably miss.

10:53.273 --> 10:54.792
Ha, ha.

10:54.826 --> 10:57.726
-You've brought this on
yourself, trying to live by

10:57.760 --> 10:59.141
their rules.

10:59.175 --> 11:01.971
You can't go over there and
teach them the lesson they

11:02.006 --> 11:04.767
deserve, without revealing
yourself.

11:04.802 --> 11:08.357
You can't be human.

11:08.391 --> 11:13.258
But as long as you're hiding,
pretending, you can't fully be

11:13.293 --> 11:14.432
wolfblood either.

11:14.466 --> 11:15.295
JIMI [OFFSCREEN]: Who
do reckon his

11:15.329 --> 11:16.779
new friend is, anyway?

11:16.814 --> 11:17.469
LIAM [OFFSCREEN]: Maybe it's
a self-help group.

11:17.504 --> 11:18.712
Weirdos anonymous.

11:18.747 --> 11:19.955
[laughter]

11:19.989 --> 11:22.198
-Can we go somewhere else?

11:22.233 --> 11:23.372
-Yes.

11:26.478 --> 11:29.309
JIMI [OFFSCREEN]:
Aw, it stinks.

11:29.343 --> 11:30.517
Argh!

11:30.551 --> 11:32.761
[growling]

11:32.795 --> 11:33.934
-Stop it!

11:35.867 --> 11:36.834
-She's an animal.

11:36.868 --> 11:38.801
She should be locked up.

11:38.836 --> 11:39.422
Ugh!

11:39.457 --> 11:40.320
She drooled on me.

11:47.223 --> 11:48.500
-They could have called
the police.

11:48.535 --> 11:50.019
People know you've been sleeping
rough out here.

11:50.054 --> 11:51.987
I mean, what if they
came to find you?

11:52.021 --> 11:53.954
-Why would I let them find me?

11:53.989 --> 11:55.438
-You're wolfblood,
not invisible.

11:55.473 --> 11:58.752
-Wolfbloods are invisible.

11:58.787 --> 12:01.410
We walk in the margins
of the world.

12:01.444 --> 12:05.034
There are senses you've never
even used, things you can do

12:05.069 --> 12:08.935
you've never even imagined,
things that your tame friends

12:08.969 --> 12:12.076
will never know how to do.

12:12.110 --> 12:15.493
We call it Eolas.

12:15.527 --> 12:16.943
And I can teach you
how to use it.

12:21.948 --> 12:23.087
Or you can go back.

12:40.207 --> 12:41.588
-So I should try and what?

12:41.622 --> 12:42.831
-Don't try.

12:42.865 --> 12:44.177
Humans try.

12:44.211 --> 12:46.179
We listen to our instincts.

12:46.213 --> 12:47.352
-Right.

12:47.387 --> 12:48.526
Listen to my instincts.

12:50.597 --> 12:51.874
Don't try it.

12:54.566 --> 12:55.982
I can't do this.

12:56.016 --> 12:57.086
I don't know how.

12:57.121 --> 13:00.331
-Look at me.

13:00.365 --> 13:02.195
Feel the earth under you.

13:04.680 --> 13:08.270
Feel the wind over you.

13:08.304 --> 13:14.379
Feel the grass, and the
clouds, and the sky.

13:14.414 --> 13:19.074
You are part of everything.

13:19.108 --> 13:21.490
You are nature.

13:47.930 --> 13:48.620
-Ha, ha!

13:48.655 --> 13:49.656
I could see, Maddy.

13:49.690 --> 13:50.484
Ha, ha.

13:50.519 --> 13:51.623
I--I get it.

13:58.665 --> 14:02.048
-He'll be all right, you know.

14:02.082 --> 14:04.326
-What if there's a whole
other pack out there?

14:04.360 --> 14:05.637
What if they turn on him?

14:05.672 --> 14:07.329
-Well, Ceri wouldn't allow
that to happen.

14:07.363 --> 14:09.469
-And what if they make
him like them, and he

14:09.503 --> 14:10.953
starts to hate us?

14:10.988 --> 14:13.956
-Look, as mixed up as Rhydian
is, he's smart.

14:13.991 --> 14:15.371
He'll make the right decision.

14:23.345 --> 14:25.726
-It is beautiful when you
are part of nature.

14:25.761 --> 14:28.281
-I can't believe it.

14:28.315 --> 14:30.524
-The pack runs with Eolas.

14:30.559 --> 14:32.492
That is how we exist.

14:32.526 --> 14:33.700
-Wow.

14:33.734 --> 14:36.910
-Rhydian, there is a mystery
inside yourself.

14:36.945 --> 14:40.396
It is not only that you
feel different,

14:40.431 --> 14:41.673
you don't feel whole.

14:41.708 --> 14:43.365
-How do you know?

14:43.399 --> 14:47.748
-Our kind can help solve that
mystery and make you compete.

14:47.783 --> 14:50.372
-You want me to go with you.

14:50.406 --> 14:51.545
-Yes.

14:51.580 --> 14:52.719
-Forever?

14:52.753 --> 14:54.031
-What have you just
got to go back to?

14:54.065 --> 14:55.446
-I've got friends.

14:55.480 --> 15:00.071
-If you come with me you'll
have a pack, a family.

15:00.106 --> 15:01.141
-I've already got a pack.

15:01.176 --> 15:03.419
-Traitors to our species.

15:03.454 --> 15:06.250
You belong with your own kind.

15:06.284 --> 15:07.044
-I can't decide.

15:07.078 --> 15:08.459
Just let me think.

15:08.493 --> 15:10.944
-Thinking is for humans.

15:10.979 --> 15:13.291
Trust your instincts.

15:13.326 --> 15:14.465
Come and be complete.

15:21.748 --> 15:25.269
-So why was he talking to her?

15:25.303 --> 15:28.030
-She's Rhydian's mom.

15:28.065 --> 15:29.204
-The homeless woman?

15:29.238 --> 15:31.206
-He hasn't gone off
with her, has he?

15:31.240 --> 15:32.345
-I don't know.

15:38.523 --> 15:41.561
-How's your smelly
friend, Rhydian?

15:41.595 --> 15:42.700
-You all right, mate?

15:42.734 --> 15:44.426
-We were worried about you.

15:44.460 --> 15:46.359
-Is your mum, OK?

15:46.393 --> 15:48.016
-You told them.

15:48.050 --> 15:49.189
-I--

15:49.224 --> 15:51.778
I told someone I was
worried about you.

15:51.812 --> 15:53.090
-So what happened?

15:53.124 --> 15:54.608
-Got home about 1:00 AM.

15:54.643 --> 15:57.646
Mr. Vaughan went ballistic,
and I'm grounded

15:57.680 --> 15:59.130
for about 100 years.

15:59.165 --> 16:02.306
But, everything's all right.

16:02.340 --> 16:03.583
-And your mom?

16:03.617 --> 16:04.756
-All righty!

16:04.791 --> 16:07.207
Let's have some quiet
in here, please.

16:07.242 --> 16:08.381
-I'll tell you later.

16:22.222 --> 16:23.361
-Rhydian, what are you doing?

16:25.363 --> 16:26.537
-I'm going with her.

16:26.571 --> 16:28.263
-What?

16:28.297 --> 16:29.160
-She's my mom.

16:29.195 --> 16:31.093
She can teach me things.

16:31.128 --> 16:32.336
-You can't just run away!

16:32.370 --> 16:34.717
-It wouldn't be the
first time.

16:34.752 --> 16:38.342
It's just the first time I'm
sad to leave people behind.

16:38.376 --> 16:39.584
-And what if it's not?

16:39.619 --> 16:42.415
What if you get there
and you hate her?

16:42.449 --> 16:43.554
-Well, maybe I will.

16:46.108 --> 16:47.385
But you got to let me try.

16:55.083 --> 16:57.637
-Tom, I owe you an apology.

16:57.671 --> 16:59.466
-Are you feeling all right?

16:59.501 --> 17:01.227
Should I get the nurse?

17:01.261 --> 17:03.229
-No, the football team,
all that stuff.

17:03.263 --> 17:04.263
I let you down.

17:04.299 --> 17:05.645
-Oh no.

17:05.679 --> 17:06.853
It was stupid, thinking you
were going to be brilliant

17:06.887 --> 17:08.613
when you don't even
like football.

17:08.647 --> 17:11.339
-So what can I do to
make up to you?

17:11.375 --> 17:12.548
-Is this a wind up?

17:12.583 --> 17:13.686
-Why do you say that?

17:13.722 --> 17:15.344
-Because you're acting
all cuddly.

17:15.378 --> 17:16.621
-No, I'm being serious.

17:16.656 --> 17:17.897
I just want to leave
with a clean slate.

17:17.933 --> 17:19.383
-Leave?

17:19.416 --> 17:21.694
-This issue, no bad feelings.

17:21.730 --> 17:25.527
-All right, well, you could
join the team again.

17:25.560 --> 17:26.424
-I can't.

17:26.459 --> 17:27.356
-And why not?

17:27.391 --> 17:28.771
-I don't belong.

17:28.806 --> 17:32.465
-Mate, you belong where
you want to be.

17:32.499 --> 17:35.088
And if you want to be on the
team, just for one game, to

17:35.123 --> 17:36.227
make it happen.

17:36.262 --> 17:37.090
-Can I do that?

17:37.125 --> 17:38.298
Just for one game?

17:38.333 --> 17:39.920
-This is the biggest
game of the season.

17:39.955 --> 17:41.543
-The one everyone's wants?

17:55.453 --> 17:56.523
-He can't play.

17:56.558 --> 17:58.146
-Miss Graham OKed it.

17:58.180 --> 17:59.319
-He doesn't even
have any boots.

18:01.563 --> 18:02.495
-You're on, Welshie.

18:02.529 --> 18:03.772
Let's get out there and win.

18:07.672 --> 18:13.920
[cheering]

18:17.268 --> 18:19.926
-Go on, Rhydian!

18:19.960 --> 18:20.823
[whistle blowing]

18:20.858 --> 18:21.859
-Let's knock it down!

18:21.893 --> 18:23.378
-Go, go, Bradlington High.

18:23.412 --> 18:25.690
Kick that ball into the sky.

18:25.725 --> 18:27.175
Beat that awful Barons Hill.

18:27.209 --> 18:28.521
Show them they are
over-the-hill.

18:28.555 --> 18:30.488
Go Bradlington!

18:30.523 --> 18:31.627
Whoa!

18:35.286 --> 18:36.218
-Get in there!

18:36.253 --> 18:37.219
KAY [OFFSCREEN]: Woo!

18:37.254 --> 18:38.358
Woo hoo!

19:06.386 --> 19:06.973
[whistle blows]

19:07.007 --> 19:08.526
-Ball in, ball in.

19:08.561 --> 19:10.356
KAY [OFFSCREEN]: Woo!

19:10.390 --> 19:11.598
-Go, go Bradlington High.

19:11.633 --> 19:14.394
Kick that ball into the sky.

19:14.429 --> 19:15.464
Beat that awful Barons Mills.

19:15.499 --> 19:17.363
Show them they are
over-the-hill.

19:17.397 --> 19:19.641
Go Rhydian!

19:19.675 --> 19:20.711
Woo!

19:20.745 --> 19:21.850
[whistle blows]

19:33.413 --> 19:35.312
[crowd cheering]

19:46.254 --> 19:48.911
-OK.

19:48.946 --> 19:50.223
Get in there.

19:53.744 --> 19:54.883
Foul ball!

19:58.990 --> 20:00.751
-The 90 minutes are up?

20:00.785 --> 20:02.822
-Then why are they
still playing?

20:02.856 --> 20:04.341
-Injury time.

20:04.375 --> 20:07.516
-Well are we winning?

20:07.551 --> 20:08.448
-It's nil-nil.

20:08.483 --> 20:09.622
Have you been even watching?

20:15.110 --> 20:16.387
-Too much space!

20:18.872 --> 20:20.322
[whistle blows]

20:20.357 --> 20:21.289
-Penalty kick.

20:21.323 --> 20:23.049
-Is that a good thing?

20:23.083 --> 20:25.741
-No, Barons Mill should
score, and then

20:25.776 --> 20:27.467
they'll win the match.

20:27.502 --> 20:30.470
-Right, penalty kick, bad.

20:58.049 --> 21:00.880
-Rhydian, ball!

21:00.914 --> 21:01.846
-Go, go!

21:01.881 --> 21:03.331
Go!

21:03.365 --> 21:06.092
-That's right, come on.

21:06.126 --> 21:08.957
[crowd cheering]

21:08.991 --> 21:09.923
-Yeah!

21:09.958 --> 21:11.062
Yeah!

21:16.689 --> 21:18.035
-Good job!

21:18.069 --> 21:18.967
-We made a goal!

21:19.001 --> 21:20.900
Good save, man!

21:20.934 --> 21:22.419
[crowd cheering]

21:29.598 --> 21:30.737
-Yeah!

21:33.809 --> 21:35.363
-That was a great kick off.

21:35.397 --> 21:35.811
-Yeah.

21:35.846 --> 21:37.019
-Great.

21:37.054 --> 21:37.710
-I'm hungry.

21:37.744 --> 21:38.504
That's right.

21:38.538 --> 21:39.677
-Yeah.

21:41.679 --> 21:43.440
-Burgers at Bernie's.

21:43.474 --> 21:44.441
You coming?

21:44.475 --> 21:45.787
-Maybe later.

21:45.821 --> 21:47.513
Great save.

21:47.547 --> 21:48.479
Great throw.

21:48.514 --> 21:49.618
-Thanks, Jimi.

21:51.724 --> 21:55.348
-I'll, um see you
in a bit, yeah?

21:55.383 --> 21:56.073
Cool.

21:56.107 --> 21:56.970
Aw, yeah, man.

21:57.005 --> 21:58.524
We own those bozos.

21:58.558 --> 21:59.697
Yeah!

22:07.567 --> 22:10.605
-Hey, the man of the match.

22:10.639 --> 22:11.640
-Tom scored the winning goal.

22:11.675 --> 22:12.917
I've never seen him so happy.

22:12.952 --> 22:14.747
-I've never seen you so happy.

22:14.781 --> 22:18.026
Well, not in human
form, anyway.

22:18.060 --> 22:22.651
-It was a buzz, winning,
being part of the team.

22:22.686 --> 22:25.930
-Belonging somewhere.

22:25.965 --> 22:27.760
-I guess.

22:27.794 --> 22:31.936
-You know, it's not too late
to change your mind.

22:39.530 --> 22:42.878
Or is this where
I say goodbye?

22:42.913 --> 22:45.156
-It's my choice, Maddy.

22:45.191 --> 22:46.779
-I hate goodbyes, anyway.

22:53.717 --> 22:54.890
-We should be gone by now.

22:54.925 --> 22:56.444
-I said I'd see you
once I'd finished.

22:56.478 --> 22:57.237
-Finished what?

22:57.272 --> 22:58.100
-Playing football.

22:58.135 --> 22:59.792
Did you watch?

22:59.826 --> 23:02.242
-I don't watch humans
playing their games.

23:02.277 --> 23:04.521
-Well, you should have.

23:04.555 --> 23:12.770
Then you might understand why
I can't come with you.

23:12.805 --> 23:13.944
-You want to stay here?

23:16.084 --> 23:18.742
-It might have been a game, but
I was part of something.

23:18.776 --> 23:19.743
Something that I was good at.

23:19.777 --> 23:20.882
Something I wanted.

23:20.916 --> 23:22.470
Not something I was born into.

23:22.504 --> 23:23.781
It was my choice.

23:23.816 --> 23:26.922
-I'm offering you freedom,
the wolfblood life.

23:26.957 --> 23:29.200
-There is no wolfblood life.

23:29.235 --> 23:31.030
Everyone gets to choose
how they want to live.

23:31.064 --> 23:33.481
And I can't live like you.

23:33.515 --> 23:36.000
If you stay around, then
we can see each other.

23:36.035 --> 23:39.625
-Did she make you do this,
your tame wolf friend?

23:39.659 --> 23:42.110
-Don't you ever call
Maddy tame!

23:42.144 --> 23:43.456
[snarling]

23:47.115 --> 23:49.048
-She's corrupted you.

23:49.082 --> 23:49.876
I'm your mother.

23:49.911 --> 23:51.050
-Who wasn't there.

23:56.780 --> 24:02.510
-Rhydian, who were you
just talking to?

24:02.544 --> 24:03.718
-No one.

24:03.752 --> 24:05.513
I though you had gone
to Bernie's?

24:05.547 --> 24:08.170
-I thought I'd come back for
