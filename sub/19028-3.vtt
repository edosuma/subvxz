00:04.304 --> 00:06.181
<i>It was a day of discovery.</i>

00:06.390 --> 00:10.144
<i>I discovered that I could sex
my pregnant girlfriend into a coma.</i>

00:10.436 --> 00:11.505
<i>Nice!</i>

00:12.229 --> 00:13.457
<i>Carla discovered that her baby</i>

00:13.647 --> 00:16.445
<i>wasn't the only one
who loved breast-feeding.</i>

00:17.151 --> 00:18.823
Are you hungry, sweetie?

00:19.028 --> 00:20.302
I could eat.

00:22.948 --> 00:25.746
<i>Dr Kelso discovered
change was not always welcome.</i>

00:26.493 --> 00:28.927
A coffee place in a hospital?

00:29.163 --> 00:32.280
What's next, Bob,
an ice cream parlour in the morgue?

00:32.540 --> 00:34.372
Admittedly, not a horrible idea,

00:34.585 --> 00:36.064
seeing that the freezers
are already down there.

00:36.253 --> 00:38.050
Plus, it'll be a perfect place for kids.

00:38.255 --> 00:41.053
One of our famous vanilla malteds
definitely takes the sting

00:41.300 --> 00:44.815
out of having to identify the
freshly-charred remains of your father.

00:45.095 --> 00:46.574
Nobody else seems to mind.

00:50.392 --> 00:52.462
I should have worn sun block.

00:55.272 --> 00:57.103
Did you get tickets yet?

01:00.069 --> 01:01.388
Another one!

01:03.000 --> 01:09.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:12.581 --> 01:14.856
Now I'm at the end of both lines.

01:16.794 --> 01:17.783
<i>Still, the best discovery</i>

01:17.961 --> 01:20.759
<i>was learning that someone I drummed
out of medicine had landed on his feet.</i>

01:21.006 --> 01:23.361
Frontsies! Cabbage!

01:23.592 --> 01:24.866
Hey, Dr D!

01:26.553 --> 01:28.464
That's what we call, "Cabbage-tastic. "

01:28.681 --> 01:29.750
Oh, I love this job.

01:29.932 --> 01:32.605
I screw up,
nobody gets hurt except Cindy.

01:33.435 --> 01:35.630
I scalded her pretty bad
with some steamed milk.

01:35.854 --> 01:37.890
You could see the bone.

01:38.107 --> 01:40.905
How about a second
of that dynamite ape impression?

01:46.365 --> 01:47.480
I'm sorry, Cindy.

01:47.658 --> 01:49.694
Once he's in monkey mode
you can't stop him.

01:49.910 --> 01:52.185
But who would want to, right? Cheers.

01:53.497 --> 01:54.691
Hey, Kim.

01:54.873 --> 01:56.784
Just checking to see
if your socks are back on

01:57.000 --> 01:58.752
since I knocked them off last night.

01:58.961 --> 02:00.314
Hello!

02:00.504 --> 02:02.813
What am I doing?
You're the mother of my child.

02:03.048 --> 02:04.003
That is so tacky.

02:04.174 --> 02:06.972
And so is this. Way to hit that, playah!

02:07.219 --> 02:09.687
- All right! Zoom. Zoom!
- Zoom.

02:10.639 --> 02:12.231
- So sorry.
- Relax, it's just sex.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.707
We should be able to talk about it.

02:13.892 --> 02:16.804
I'm not telling Isabella
she's got a vagina till she turns 18.

02:17.062 --> 02:18.700
That's gonna be
an awkward birthday party.

02:18.897 --> 02:22.207
Do not tell my daughter
she has a vagina! I'm serious.

02:22.651 --> 02:24.369
It may have already come up.

02:24.570 --> 02:27.289
Kim, J.D. tells us you're looking
around town for a new job.

02:27.531 --> 02:30.921
Yeah, I just don't think the department
head here is ever gonna promote me.

02:31.201 --> 02:32.429
Why?

02:33.328 --> 02:35.364
Dr Lemke, you're gonna love this.

02:35.581 --> 02:37.060
We're a husband
and wife piano-playing team,

02:37.249 --> 02:39.479
only I have no hands.

02:48.052 --> 02:51.044
- With my head.
- How great is that?

02:51.305 --> 02:53.421
This is my wife, Sally.

02:53.640 --> 02:54.629
She lost her thumbs last month

02:54.808 --> 02:57.800
when our pet Komodo dragon, Morty,
got out of his cage.

03:01.023 --> 03:03.742
On the bright side,
you have beautiful nubs.

03:05.736 --> 03:07.567
A tip jar? Really?

03:07.780 --> 03:10.578
So, what am I supposed to do,
just duke you my change

03:10.824 --> 03:12.462
because you poured hot water
through beans?

03:12.659 --> 03:15.332
Well, I tell you what, my friend, unless
you're also planning on giving me

03:15.579 --> 03:17.615
a complimentary reach-around
with my beverage,

03:17.831 --> 03:20.265
I'm afraid the answer is, yeah, no!

03:21.251 --> 03:22.479
Here's a novel idea.

03:22.669 --> 03:24.625
Why don't you go fetch me
a very large cup of coffee

03:24.838 --> 03:28.990
with so damn many fake sugars in it
that the coffee itself gets cancer?

03:30.260 --> 03:32.854
Guys, guys, I've got a good one.
Is it me or does someone...

03:33.097 --> 03:35.895
...someone need to switch to decaf?
... someone need to switch to decaf?

03:37.226 --> 03:40.423
Lay off of Elliot. She doesn't watch
as much old TV as we do.

03:41.355 --> 03:43.311
You actually stood up for me.

03:43.524 --> 03:44.673
But now I'm forced to ask,

03:44.858 --> 03:47.531
"Who are you
and what have you done with Turk?"

03:47.778 --> 03:50.611
- Stop finishing my awesome jokes!
- Oh, my God.

04:10.300 --> 04:12.416
She's so beautiful. Can I hold her?

04:12.636 --> 04:13.625
That's up to Turk.

04:13.804 --> 04:16.716
He's kind of paranoid
about people dropping her.

04:19.435 --> 04:22.347
Yeah, you've got decent hands.
Go ahead.

04:22.604 --> 04:24.959
I get her first
because we're best friends.

04:25.190 --> 04:26.908
Elliot. Ted, give it!

04:29.611 --> 04:30.805
I'm next.

04:32.322 --> 04:34.233
- What?
- You drop everything.

04:34.450 --> 04:35.803
When do...

04:36.869 --> 04:37.858
Besides now.

04:38.037 --> 04:42.553
Look, come on, it is a human life.
I'll focus. Give it to me. Right here.

04:45.711 --> 04:47.110
Wait, one moresie!

04:47.296 --> 04:50.527
So, Carla, how much time
do you think you'll take off?

04:52.217 --> 04:55.971
Look at this little angel.
I may never go back to work.

04:59.892 --> 05:01.450
I heard suckling.

05:05.397 --> 05:07.991
So, you're having chest pains,
Mr Turner.

05:08.233 --> 05:10.303
Actually, it's Dr Turner.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.518
You look like someone I used to date.

05:12.738 --> 05:14.091
I had a brief "older guy" jones,

05:14.281 --> 05:15.714
but now I'm with
someone more age-appropriate

05:15.908 --> 05:18.547
and I'm like, "What was I thinking?"

05:18.786 --> 05:19.935
We are disgusting.

05:20.120 --> 05:22.588
Yeah, but for some reason,
I was curious.

05:22.831 --> 05:26.062
- Anyhoo, we'll just run the usual tests.
- Sounds good.

05:28.128 --> 05:31.518
Dr Turner seems like a nice guy
and he's hot.

05:31.799 --> 05:35.394
You know, like if you left
Brad Pitt out in the sun forever.

05:35.678 --> 05:38.067
Stop it, Elliot, it took you months
to get over that old man fetish.

05:38.305 --> 05:40.899
Blondie, he is private practise.

05:41.141 --> 05:42.494
Those guys are cocky jackasses

05:42.685 --> 05:46.280
who don't give two shakes about
anybody else's opinion but their own.

05:46.563 --> 05:49.123
They're me, with one addendum,
they're whores.

05:49.358 --> 05:52.270
And I'm not talking about the good
kind of whores, like my ex-wife.

05:52.528 --> 05:54.200
They're whores for money.

05:54.405 --> 05:56.839
- Is that a tip jar?
- Look.

05:58.450 --> 06:01.362
I'm figuring if those lumps down at the
coffee shop can have one, I can, too.

06:01.620 --> 06:04.009
Listen to me,
you may like Turner right now,

06:04.248 --> 06:06.364
but he is a doctor
and doctors make terrible patients.

06:06.583 --> 06:09.256
Sooner or later,
they all try to treat themselves.

06:10.003 --> 06:12.597
- Perry, a quick word...
- Bobbo, no time!

06:12.840 --> 06:15.035
Gotta go tell Mr Clancy
that his tumour is benign.

06:15.259 --> 06:16.248
Is that not exciting?

06:16.427 --> 06:19.180
Should be worth a finsky.
What do you think?

06:21.807 --> 06:24.162
- Where the hell did you all come from?
- Sneak attack.

06:24.393 --> 06:26.304
You can put your shoes on again,
guys, nice work.

06:26.520 --> 06:28.636
Dr Kelso, as spokesman for
the support staff of this hospital,

06:28.856 --> 06:29.845
I have a request.

06:30.024 --> 06:33.858
I do not want to hear any more
about a college scholarship fund.

06:34.153 --> 06:36.713
Stop filling your children's heads
with nonsense.

06:36.947 --> 06:37.936
Pull them out of high school

06:38.115 --> 06:40.310
and teach them a trade
like plumbing or undertaking.

06:40.534 --> 06:43.685
None of us here even have kids,
except for Margo and she sold hers.

06:43.954 --> 06:46.593
- We want a dental plan.
- Dental is for old people.

06:46.832 --> 06:50.541
You young bucks have years before
you have to worry about your choppers.

06:50.836 --> 06:52.588
One, two...

06:56.258 --> 06:57.771
Lovely. No.

07:00.637 --> 07:03.993
Rudy, did you tear
an actual tooth out of your head?

07:05.225 --> 07:07.739
We're all faking it, man.
What are you...

07:07.978 --> 07:08.967
Okay, don't worry. You know what?

07:09.146 --> 07:12.058
I've got a jar of monkey teeth
in my workbench. What's that, molar?

07:12.316 --> 07:13.669
We're gonna be all right.

07:17.529 --> 07:18.962
Man, we got smoked.

07:19.156 --> 07:22.114
That's what we get for playing
a bunch of G's from the hood.

07:22.368 --> 07:24.199
Those guys are Indian.

07:25.287 --> 07:28.643
So, Rajesh isn't one of those cool,
black-only names like, "Anfernee"?

07:28.916 --> 07:31.476
No, Rajesh is like "Steve" in India.

07:31.710 --> 07:32.699
Yeah.

07:33.670 --> 07:34.705
Why are we stopping?

07:34.880 --> 07:37.075
You always buy me a cotton candy
after the game

07:37.299 --> 07:38.812
to celebrate my good sportsmanship.

07:39.009 --> 07:39.998
Yeah, well, you know what?

07:40.177 --> 07:41.371
I can't be buying you stuff all the time.

07:41.553 --> 07:43.669
Yeah, well, I'm very close to a tantrum.

07:43.889 --> 07:46.449
Could you guys look at my shoulder?
I tweaked it pretty good.

07:46.684 --> 07:47.639
Come on, Vijay.

07:47.810 --> 07:49.721
First you dunk on me and yell,
"Who's your bitch?"

07:49.937 --> 07:51.370
Now you want free medical advice?

07:51.563 --> 07:53.440
How did I not know
these guys were Indian?

07:53.649 --> 07:54.718
I'll give you 20 bucks.

07:54.900 --> 07:57.653
I'm sorry, my friend,
but that's just unethical.

07:57.903 --> 07:59.814
Done and done.

08:03.075 --> 08:04.554
Who's the new guy?

08:04.743 --> 08:06.859
This is Dr Kershnar from my practise.

08:07.079 --> 08:10.958
Elliot Reid, I was telling you about.
Give her a wave. Attaboy. So...

08:11.250 --> 08:12.239
Look, as a doctor,

08:12.418 --> 08:14.693
I know that you're gonna be tempted
to want to treat yourself,

08:14.920 --> 08:17.434
and I just want you to know
that's not gonna fly with me.

08:17.673 --> 08:19.550
- Understood.
- Great.

08:19.758 --> 08:20.747
Now, I believe that surgery

08:20.926 --> 08:22.882
on your abdominal aortic aneurism's
gonna be too aggressive.

08:23.095 --> 08:25.086
I'd like to start you
on 25 grams of Lopressor.

08:25.305 --> 08:28.377
- Don't you mean 25 milligrams?
- There, see?

08:28.642 --> 08:30.997
You're already trying to treat yourself.
That was a test.

08:31.228 --> 08:33.947
- But 25 grams would kill me.
- I know.

08:35.190 --> 08:37.703
- But it's still a test.
- Fine.

08:38.861 --> 08:41.375
From now on, you're the doctor.

08:45.325 --> 08:48.954
All right, relax. You're fine.
Just ice it when you get home.

08:50.581 --> 08:52.094
Zoom?

08:52.291 --> 08:54.168
Put that away, Turk!
That's back-alley money!

08:54.376 --> 08:56.287
- Relax.
- Hey!

08:56.503 --> 08:58.812
I'll give you 20 bucks
if you check out my rash.

08:59.048 --> 09:01.084
I'm sorry, Cotton Candy Man,

09:01.300 --> 09:04.895
but unlike my friend here,
I have no interest in being sued for...

09:05.179 --> 09:07.773
- Do I smell blue?
- Just added the dye.

09:09.058 --> 09:13.370
You crafty, crafty man!
That is fluffing up nicely.

09:13.687 --> 09:16.247
Hey, give me some money.
I'm jonesing for some C-squared.

09:16.482 --> 09:19.280
You don't want my "back-alley money,"
do you?

09:19.526 --> 09:21.517
You heartless bastard.

09:21.737 --> 09:24.410
All right, let's see your disgusting rash.

09:26.950 --> 09:29.384
It's probably just eczema.
One blue, please.

09:36.293 --> 09:38.807
I'd like to see the blueberry again.

09:42.841 --> 09:44.672
Blueberries taste fresh.

09:46.095 --> 09:48.768
Hint of lemon zest. I'm intrigued.

09:50.641 --> 09:54.236
And, unfortunately, processed flour.
No, thank you.

09:54.520 --> 09:56.317
Let me try your carrot.

10:00.526 --> 10:03.916
I have a non-fat latte
with room for schnapps for Janitor?

10:04.196 --> 10:06.107
Yep. Thank you.

10:07.825 --> 10:09.895
- Nice braces.
- Yeah.

10:10.119 --> 10:13.156
You're not worried
about the spider monkeys?

10:13.414 --> 10:14.403
Spider monkeys?

10:14.581 --> 10:18.415
Spider monkeys see intricate
metalwork as a display of dominance.

10:18.711 --> 10:21.305
It's a threat to them.
They tear your eyes out.

10:21.547 --> 10:23.822
Well, I'm just psyched
this place is paying for them.

10:24.049 --> 10:25.641
You get dental?

10:29.471 --> 10:33.180
So, Dr Turner said that
I am a very talented young physician.

10:33.475 --> 10:37.434
Jordan said I'm the only man
she ever wants to have sex with.

10:39.189 --> 10:40.622
Aren't we sharing fantastic lies

10:40.816 --> 10:42.772
we choose to believe
for personal reasons?

10:42.985 --> 10:44.703
He's actually a very deferential patient.

10:44.903 --> 10:47.212
Instead of surgery,
I'm treating his AAA with drugs.

10:47.448 --> 10:48.483
Dope!

10:48.657 --> 10:52.730
I think Dr Chatterbox there
scheduled him for surgery.

10:53.037 --> 10:54.709
What the hell, Kersh?

10:57.041 --> 10:59.316
I don't care
if we had extra coffee money left over,

10:59.543 --> 11:02.103
I don't feel right taking that guy's cash.

11:02.337 --> 11:05.056
Dude, stop stressing. See you later.

11:07.426 --> 11:09.860
Is anybody planning on emptying that?

11:12.056 --> 11:15.605
<i>Sometimes everything you need
to know is on the side of a coffee cup.</i>

11:16.435 --> 11:21.111
<i>"Never underestimate those
around you for they may betray you. "</i>

11:21.440 --> 11:24.000
Greetings, customer!
What can I get you?

11:27.404 --> 11:29.122
<i>"They may deceive you. "</i>

11:29.323 --> 11:30.915
And here we are.

11:31.116 --> 11:33.505
Even though Kershnar's signature is
on the chart,

11:33.744 --> 11:36.622
this is the gentleman
who ordered the surgery.

11:36.872 --> 11:39.227
No, he didn't. Tell him.

11:39.458 --> 11:41.369
What would you like me to say?

11:41.585 --> 11:45.214
I'm just gonna go ahead
and tip myself for calling this one.

11:46.090 --> 11:49.287
Thank you, me!

11:50.469 --> 11:54.508
<i>"In the end, those same people will
make you wish you'd never met them. "</i>

11:55.557 --> 11:58.947
<i>Maybe that wasn't just a rash
on Cotton Candy Man.</i>

12:04.733 --> 12:07.008
<i>I didn't tell Kim about
how I most likely ruined my career</i>

12:07.236 --> 12:09.591
<i>by misdiagnosing
the Cotton Candy Man.</i>

12:09.822 --> 12:12.939
<i>I don't like to be a burden
to the people I care about.</i>

12:13.200 --> 12:15.509
Turk, I need you and I need you now.

12:15.744 --> 12:19.657
Isabella, this is the man you'll be
competing with for your father's love.

12:19.957 --> 12:21.993
Goochy-goochy-goo. Turk, now!

12:23.210 --> 12:27.676
- Baby, he's using his emergency tone.
- Go ahead, I have to feed her anyway.

12:29.049 --> 12:33.167
My breasts are so sore.
I wish I could just give you formula.

12:33.470 --> 12:37.543
Formula's bad for the baby.
Boob milk's healthier.

12:40.019 --> 12:41.088
His rash was probably purpura

12:41.270 --> 12:43.022
from disseminated
intravascular coagulopathy,

12:43.230 --> 12:45.425
and I missed it, Turk. I'm screwed.

12:45.649 --> 12:48.846
Okay, you go in there
and take care of things. I'll...

12:49.111 --> 12:50.100
I'll just stand out here

12:50.279 --> 12:53.589
and think about all the things
I'll miss about being a doctor.

12:53.866 --> 12:57.381
The light cotton outfits, the free gauze.

13:02.249 --> 13:03.568
He's gone.

13:05.669 --> 13:06.988
Somebody shot him.

13:09.173 --> 13:12.529
I hope it wasn't the Corn Dog Guy.
They never got along.

13:14.720 --> 13:18.110
Look, Dr Turner, you're older,
you're not in the best health.

13:18.390 --> 13:20.904
I really think
that this surgery could kill you.

13:21.143 --> 13:23.498
Are they gonna come in
and shave me soon?

13:23.729 --> 13:27.404
- I'm still your primary physician.
- No, Kershnar's my lead now.

13:29.360 --> 13:31.794
I think surgery is the right choice.

13:32.029 --> 13:33.940
What? Did you give him cue cards?

13:34.156 --> 13:36.465
That way he gets it exactly right.

13:39.995 --> 13:41.314
You don't scare me.

13:41.497 --> 13:44.455
Eventually,
you will all come crawling back.

13:44.708 --> 13:45.743
Now, how about somebody gets me

13:45.918 --> 13:48.637
a banana nut muffin
and hold the spit, please.

13:48.879 --> 13:52.667
As manager, I reserve the right
to refuse service to anyone.

13:52.966 --> 13:54.194
Manager?

13:54.385 --> 13:57.934
- You have worked here one day.
- Corporate loved my ingenuity.

13:58.222 --> 14:00.782
I was saying, the two most
addictive substances on Earth

14:01.016 --> 14:03.735
are caffeine and nicotine.

14:05.270 --> 14:06.498
Behold.

14:09.316 --> 14:12.945
Smoke-accino for Kyle.

14:13.237 --> 14:16.752
Kyle? Smoke-accino for Kyle.
Enjoy that.

14:18.158 --> 14:20.467
That's as tall as he's gonna get.

14:21.912 --> 14:23.425
I feel like I dodged a bullet.

14:23.622 --> 14:25.897
Trust me, Brown Bear, you don't want
this hanging over your head.

14:26.125 --> 14:28.036
Find Vijay
and give him his 20 bucks back.

14:28.252 --> 14:30.971
Yeah, but then I'd have to give
the money back to all the others.

14:31.213 --> 14:33.204
I kind of did a few diagnoses
at the mall yesterday.

14:33.424 --> 14:35.984
Are you crazy? You could get sued.

14:36.218 --> 14:38.095
Secondly, I can't believe
you went to the mall without me.

14:38.303 --> 14:40.134
I specifically told you
I needed to buy loafers.

14:40.347 --> 14:42.144
And, thirdly, how could you
go to the mall without me?

14:42.349 --> 14:43.338
That's our thing!

14:43.517 --> 14:46.236
Well, I don't see you giving the money
back to Cotton Candy Man.

14:46.478 --> 14:48.514
As a matter of fact, I already did.

14:51.525 --> 14:53.595
A 20! Score!

14:56.155 --> 14:58.032
Cool shirt.

14:58.532 --> 14:59.885
All right, I earned that money,

15:00.075 --> 15:03.545
and I'm not giving it back and there's
nothing you can do to make me.

15:03.829 --> 15:05.945
Give those people their money back!

15:06.165 --> 15:08.520
- I can't believe you told.
- Turk, we're doctors.

15:08.751 --> 15:10.742
We live by a moral code.

15:10.961 --> 15:14.271
<i>Aloha! I came to see the little kahuna.</i>

15:17.176 --> 15:18.131
Giant coffee.

15:18.302 --> 15:20.862
Saw you coming.
Here's your venti drip.

15:21.096 --> 15:24.054
Say, how about
a Corinne Bailey Rae CD?

15:24.308 --> 15:26.185
With her stripped-down sound
and chilled-out vibe,

15:26.393 --> 15:30.306
this British soul superstar
is one of the year's hottest newcomers.

15:31.690 --> 15:34.204
You know what? I'll take one of those.

15:35.110 --> 15:36.338
It's a sale.

15:37.196 --> 15:39.710
You know the worst thing
about Turner's surgery?

15:39.948 --> 15:43.941
I'm gonna be right, but he's gonna die.
It'll be a hollow victory.

15:44.244 --> 15:45.393
If I got to be right

15:45.579 --> 15:49.333
and have a private practise doctor
die due to his own idiocy,

15:49.625 --> 15:52.219
I would call that a pretty full victory.

15:54.880 --> 15:58.668
- Banana nut muffin, please.
- Sir, I've been told not to serve you.

16:03.389 --> 16:05.778
Hey! Just take me.

16:06.016 --> 16:08.325
What are they gonna do,
put you in jail?

16:08.560 --> 16:11.711
You're Bob Kelso.
Just grab me and run.

16:12.856 --> 16:13.971
Do it!

16:23.701 --> 16:26.898
All right, I'm going on break.
Don't touch the muffin puppet.

16:31.458 --> 16:34.291
Let's see if you're qualified
to hold your own baby.

16:38.924 --> 16:40.915
I caught it! That counts.

16:43.220 --> 16:45.973
I'm gonna go hold
the crap out of that baby!

16:46.849 --> 16:49.682
J.D., what the hell? I'm a surgeon.
That could have hit my hand.

16:49.935 --> 16:51.084
Why are you being so weird lately?

16:51.270 --> 16:52.749
You won't loan me money
for cotton candy,

16:52.938 --> 16:54.929
you're charging strangers
for medical advice,

16:55.149 --> 16:56.662
and now you're worried
about your hand?

16:56.859 --> 16:57.848
Who are you?

16:58.027 --> 17:00.302
...and what did you do with Turk?
... and what did you do with Turk?

17:00.529 --> 17:02.884
Great work, everybody, thank you.

17:03.824 --> 17:05.462
I asked them to help me out
for emphasis.

17:05.659 --> 17:06.978
Seriously, what's going on?

17:07.161 --> 17:09.152
You saw how it happened yesterday.

17:10.414 --> 17:14.009
Look at this little angel.
I may never go back to work.

17:18.088 --> 17:22.080
How the hell am I supposed to
take care of a whole family by myself?

17:25.137 --> 17:27.287
I'm so sorry, Barbie.

17:27.513 --> 17:29.152
Why didn't he listen?

17:34.271 --> 17:35.704
I thought that you hated him.

17:35.898 --> 17:39.686
When it comes to torturing you,
everybody's on the same page.

17:39.985 --> 17:43.500
<i>You know, Reid,
you had the cojones to stand up to me,</i>

17:43.781 --> 17:46.773
unlike Kershnar,
whom I've so demoralised

17:47.034 --> 17:50.071
he's basically my trained chimp.

17:56.335 --> 17:57.893
He's almost human.

17:59.213 --> 18:04.367
Anyway, I've got enough yes-men,
you've got a spine, join my practise.

18:04.718 --> 18:06.197
You could still work out of this hospital.

18:06.387 --> 18:10.062
The only difference
is you'd make double the money.

18:10.349 --> 18:12.419
Easy, buddy.
That smell burning your nostrils

18:12.643 --> 18:15.077
isn't just the baby throw up
on her jacket.

18:15.312 --> 18:17.348
I got to hold Isabella.

18:17.564 --> 18:20.681
She squirted out of my arms,
but Carla caught her.

18:20.943 --> 18:23.935
That's the smell of a doctor
with integrity.

18:24.196 --> 18:27.313
Also, you'll never have to answer
to this guy again.

18:36.709 --> 18:39.985
- Wow, I got a family.
- I know.

18:40.254 --> 18:43.007
In seven months,
I'm gonna have a family, too.

18:44.758 --> 18:49.070
Did you ever think we'd be here back
when we were freshmen in college?

18:49.388 --> 18:52.141
Remember that first week when I found
you hooking up with my girlfriend

18:52.391 --> 18:54.382
and you said you guys were only naked
underneath the covers

18:54.601 --> 18:56.831
because you'd had a
water balloon fight and you were cold?

18:57.062 --> 18:59.622
J.D., for the last time,
nothing happened.

18:59.857 --> 19:02.007
Please, this isn't about that.

19:03.694 --> 19:07.289
It's just that I looked all over,
I never found any balloons.

19:07.614 --> 19:10.003
You think there'd be some balloons.

19:10.826 --> 19:13.181
I look at Isabella and I get really scared

19:13.412 --> 19:15.846
and I'm gonna need you to be there
to help me through this.

19:16.081 --> 19:18.231
Well, that sucks because I was
counting on you to make it look easy

19:18.459 --> 19:20.893
so I know I can handle it
when my turn comes.

19:21.337 --> 19:22.531
Awesome.

19:24.006 --> 19:26.645
Turk, you're at the beginning
of your career.

19:26.884 --> 19:29.000
You know
you're gonna make plenty of money.

19:29.219 --> 19:31.858
It's good to hear that from you,
thank you.

19:32.097 --> 19:35.134
- You're gonna be just fine.
- I suppose so.

19:37.811 --> 19:39.961
- Totally fine.
- Yeah.

19:40.731 --> 19:42.528
Would you mind telling me
that I'm gonna be fine, Turk?

19:42.733 --> 19:44.405
Am I gonna be fine?
I think I'm gonna be fine.

19:44.610 --> 19:47.602
Well, I would, but I don't know
how much you like Kim.

19:47.863 --> 19:51.014
- I really like her.
- Then, you're gonna be fine.

19:52.701 --> 19:53.850
Thanks.

19:56.872 --> 20:00.228
Is there anything else
you wanna tell me or admit to?

20:02.169 --> 20:06.082
I mean, I looked everywhere.
There was no signs of balloons.

20:07.383 --> 20:09.453
<i>Opportunities are everywhere.</i>

20:10.803 --> 20:13.237
<i>Whether it's accepting an old job...</i>

20:13.472 --> 20:14.621
Hey.

20:17.559 --> 20:19.436
You can have your dental.

20:21.397 --> 20:23.194
Now clean up this mess.

20:28.946 --> 20:30.743
<i>...or taking a new job.</i>

20:32.032 --> 20:34.262
I'd like to join your practise.

20:39.373 --> 20:41.682
<i>As for me, I was just excited
to have the opportunity</i>

20:41.917 --> 20:44.226
<i>to get to know
the mother of my child better.</i>

20:44.461 --> 20:47.771
- I got offered a new job.
- Cool! Is it over at County?

20:48.048 --> 20:50.721
Because that way
I can drop you off every morning.

20:50.968 --> 20:52.924
It's in Tacoma, Washington.

20:56.473 --> 20:59.271
That's gonna be a little rough
on my scooter.
