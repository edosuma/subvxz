WEBVTT

00:01.869 --> 00:03.804
ANGIE.

00:03.804 --> 00:04.772
HEY, DADDY.

00:04.772 --> 00:08.076
WE NEED YOUR OPINION.

00:10.144 --> 00:11.979
(as Ricardo Montalban's
Mr. Roarke) WELCOME

00:11.979 --> 00:14.115
TO FANTASY ISLAND.

00:17.118 --> 00:18.619
PLACES, EVERYONE.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.888
(as HervÃ© Villechaize's Tattoo)
BOSS, BOSS,

00:20.888 --> 00:22.756
THE PLANE, THE PLANE.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.893
(as Ricardo Montalban's
Mr. Roarke) SHUT UP, TATTOO.

00:25.893 --> 00:28.762
PLACES.

00:28.762 --> 00:32.300
ANGIE, HE WANTS TO WEAR THIS TUX
IN OUR WEDDING. HELP ME.

00:32.300 --> 00:34.302
THIS IS MY LUCKY TUX.

00:34.302 --> 00:36.804
IT'S THE ONLY SUIT
I BROUGHT WITH ME

00:36.804 --> 00:38.806
WHEN I ESCAPED FROM CUBA.

00:38.806 --> 00:40.608
SO WAIT A MINUTE,
VIC.

00:40.608 --> 00:44.312
YOUR RAFT
HAD A DISCO ON IT?

00:44.312 --> 00:46.680
WHERE'S MIAMI?
THAT WAY?

00:47.881 --> 00:49.383
SHARK!

00:50.951 --> 00:53.554
WE FLEW HERE. STOP IT.

00:53.554 --> 00:55.689
ANGIE,
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

00:55.689 --> 00:58.959
BUT SINCE YOU'RE NOT GETTING
MARRIED FOR A COUPLE MONTHS,

00:58.959 --> 01:00.961
THERE'S STILL TIME
TO GET A TUXEDO

01:00.961 --> 01:02.830
THAT ISN'T OLDER
THAN YOUR BRIDE.

01:02.830 --> 01:05.933
ACTUALLY,
WE'RE MOVING THE WEDDING UP.

01:05.933 --> 01:07.735
AND I'M IN OVER MY HEAD.

01:07.735 --> 01:10.804
WOULD YOU CONSIDER
PLANNING OUR WEDDING?

01:10.804 --> 01:12.606
WELL, I'M REALLY BOOKED UP,

01:12.606 --> 01:14.708
AND I DON'T KNOW YOU
THAT WELL.

01:14.708 --> 01:16.910
I WOULDN'T KNOW
WHAT YOU LIKE.

01:16.910 --> 01:18.112
OH, PRINCESS.

01:18.112 --> 01:19.747
YES, DADDY?
YES, DADDY?

01:23.317 --> 01:26.854
OH, YEAH, THAT'S GOING
IN THE WEDDING TOAST.

01:26.854 --> 01:30.191
EXCUSE ME, LINDSAY. I-I NEED TO
TALK TO ANGIE FOR A MOMENT.

01:30.191 --> 01:33.794
PLEASE?
NO PROBLEM. I'VE GOT
AN MP3 PLAYER IN MY PHONE.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.598
SO, UH, YOU WON'T
PLAN THE WEDDING

01:37.598 --> 01:40.501
BECAUSE YOU'RE STILL UPSET
ABOUT HOW YOUNG LINDSAY IS?

01:40.501 --> 01:43.637
* PIMPS DON'T PAY,
DON'T PLAY ME THAT WAY *

01:51.111 --> 01:54.282
LET'S TALK
IN THE OTHER ROOM.

01:58.852 --> 02:00.688
DAD, WHO'S THAT?

02:00.688 --> 02:04.858
MAX, THAT'S GONNA BE
YOUR GRANDMA.

02:09.163 --> 02:11.732
SO DO YOU WANT TO PLAN
THE WEDDING OR NOT?

02:11.732 --> 02:13.734
BECAUSE IF THE ANSWER
IS NO,

02:13.734 --> 02:15.603
I'LL JUST TAKE MY MONEY
ELSEWHERE.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.605
WELL, I'M SURPRISED
YOU HAVE ANY MONEY LEFT

02:17.605 --> 02:19.607
AFTER EVERYTHING ELSE
YOU BOUGHT HER--

02:19.607 --> 02:21.609
THE--THE NECKLACE,
THE--THE PURSES, THE CAR.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.478
DADDY, DON'T YOU THINK THERE'S
A CHANCE SHE COULD BE USING YOU?

02:24.478 --> 02:28.081
(clicks tongue)
WELL, ANGIE, WAIT A MINUTE.
HE'S NOT THE VICTIM HERE.

02:28.081 --> 02:30.083
THINK ABOUT
ALL THE HORRIBLE THINGS

02:30.083 --> 02:32.520
SHE HAS TO DO
TO GET THAT STUFF.

02:36.290 --> 02:37.691
I MEAN, LOOK,

02:37.691 --> 02:42.196
IMAGINE BEING KISSED ALL OVER
BY THAT MOUSTACHE.

02:43.764 --> 02:46.900
IT--IT'S LIKE BEING RUN OVER
BY A STREET SWEEPER, JUST...

02:56.944 --> 02:59.713
I'M SORRY,

02:59.713 --> 03:02.783
BUT I CAN'T PLAN A WEDDING
I DON'T APPROVE OF.

03:02.783 --> 03:06.320
COME ON.
SHE'S NOT USING ME.

03:06.320 --> 03:10.891
WHY IS IT SO CRAZY THAT A WOMAN
LIKE LINDSAY COULD LOVE ME?

03:10.891 --> 03:14.495
WELL, YOU KNOW, YOU GOT
THE TALL/SHORT THING...

03:16.530 --> 03:19.633
THE HOT/NOT HOT THING...

03:19.633 --> 03:22.770
THE ALIVE/HALF-DEAD THING...

03:24.538 --> 03:27.641
I MADE A LIST THE OTHER NIGHT.
WHAT DID I DO WITH IT?

03:27.641 --> 03:30.110
BUT IT FEELS LIKE
LINDSAY LOVES ME.

03:30.110 --> 03:33.113
WELL, THEN AGAIN, IT FELT LIKE
MY FIRST WIFE LOVED ME,

03:33.113 --> 03:36.884
BUT AFTER 40 YEARS OF MARRIAGE,
SHE CHEATED ON ME.

03:36.884 --> 03:38.652
COME, ON, VIC.
LOOK, I'M MESSING WITH YOU, MAN.

03:38.652 --> 03:41.322
LIKE, EH, I'M SURE
LINDSAY LOVES YOU.

03:41.322 --> 03:42.823
AY.

03:42.823 --> 03:47.828
MAN TO MAN, DO YOU THINK
SHE'S MARRYING ME FOR ME?

03:47.828 --> 03:50.531
OF COURSE SHE IS, VIC.
STOP DOUBTING YOURSELF, MAN.

03:50.531 --> 03:52.800
HEY,
TRUST YOUR INSTINCTS.

03:52.800 --> 03:57.405
HMM. YOU ARE RIGHT.
WHAT AM I WORRYING ABOUT?

03:57.405 --> 03:58.772
I'M GETTING MARRIED.

03:58.772 --> 04:04.144
WAIT, WHAT'S THAT
THAT YOU JUST RIPPED UP?

04:04.144 --> 04:08.549
GEORGE, I'M FLYING ON LOVE,
AND I DON'T NEED A PARACHUTE.

04:10.318 --> 04:11.952
VIC, WAIT!

04:11.952 --> 04:13.787
LINDSAY...

04:15.756 --> 04:19.927
THERE IS NO LOVE
WHERE THERE IS NO TRUST.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.729
I TORE UP MY PRENUP.

04:21.729 --> 04:26.400
PAPI, NOW I KNOW
YOU REALLY LOVE ME.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.135
WE SHOULD CELEBRATE.

04:28.135 --> 04:30.804
LET'S BUY THOSE DIAMOND EARRINGS
THAT I SAW AT THE MALL

04:30.804 --> 04:33.240
AND ONE OF THOSE
CINNAMON PRETZELS THAT YOU LOVE.

04:33.240 --> 04:34.775
(gasps)

04:37.878 --> 04:39.947
OH, ANGIE?

04:41.782 --> 04:44.084
ARE THEY GONE?
YEAH. YOU KNOW WHAT?

04:44.084 --> 04:45.986
I'M STARTING TO WORRY
ABOUT LINDSAY, TOO.

04:45.986 --> 04:48.422
WE SHOULD INVITE HER OVER
FOR DINNER

04:48.422 --> 04:51.559
AND SEE IF SHE'S REALLY
AFTER VIC'S MONEY.
WHAT MADE YOU
CHANGE YOUR MIND?

04:51.559 --> 04:55.496
I DON'T WANT TO SEE
YOUR DAD GET HURT?

04:55.496 --> 04:57.898
WELL, NEITHER DO I.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.901
THAT'S WHY I'M SO GLAD I TALKED
HIM INTO GETTING THAT PRENUP.

05:02.436 --> 05:05.839
PRENUP? WHAT KIND OF MAN STARTS
HIS MARRIAGE WITH A PRENUP?

05:05.839 --> 05:08.909
ANGIE,
I DIDN'T GET ONE WITH YOU.

05:08.909 --> 05:10.744
ALL YOU HAD WAS $12

05:10.744 --> 05:14.582
AND SOME STUPID DREAM
ABOUT BEING A ROCK STAR.

05:14.582 --> 05:15.816
I WISH I HAD
A PRENUP RIGHT NOW.

05:15.816 --> 05:19.453
I'D GIVE YOU $6
AND HALF MY PAIN.

05:21.622 --> 05:23.724
I'M NOT CRYING.
I'M FRUSTRATED.

05:24.658 --> 05:27.795
(War's "Low Rider" playing)

05:31.465 --> 05:33.333
* ALL MY FRIENDS

05:33.333 --> 05:36.904
* KNOW THE LOW RIDER

05:38.506 --> 05:40.073
* THE LOW RIDER

05:40.073 --> 05:45.245
* IS A LITTLE HIGHER

05:45.245 --> 05:48.816
**

05:53.787 --> 05:56.824
THAT WAS A GREAT MEAL.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR DESSERT.
MM.

05:56.824 --> 05:59.026
SO, LINDSAY, WHY DID YOU
FALL IN LOVE WITH VIC?

05:59.026 --> 06:01.028
WELL, IT WAS LOVE
AT FIRST SIGHT.

06:01.028 --> 06:03.063
WHEN I SAW VIC
SITTING IN THE COFFEE SHOP,

06:03.063 --> 06:05.265
HE WAS MORE HANDSOME
THAN I IMAGINED.

06:05.265 --> 06:08.168
OH,
THAT IS SO ROMANTIC.

06:08.168 --> 06:12.940
I HOPE THAT HAPPENS TO ME,
BUT RIGHT NOW I'M STILL LOOKIN'.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.076
I DON'T KNOW IF YOU
EVER THOUGHT ABOUT THIS,

06:16.076 --> 06:20.113
BUT I'M CLOSER TO BEING 26
THAN I AM TO ZERO.

06:22.215 --> 06:23.684
W-WAIT.

06:27.120 --> 06:28.989
YEAH, I AM.

06:28.989 --> 06:33.627
STOP HITTING ON FAMILY, MAN.
IT'S JUST LAZY.

06:36.697 --> 06:40.000
SO, LINDSAY, OTHER THAN
MY DAD'S GOOD LOOKS,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.002
WHAT ELSE
DO YOU LOVE ABOUT HIM?

06:42.002 --> 06:43.871
I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT.

06:43.871 --> 06:45.873
YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT
OUR AGE DIFFERENCE,

06:45.873 --> 06:47.875
BUT AGE IS JUST A NUMBER.

06:47.875 --> 06:50.410
VICTOR IS SO CONFIDENT,
THAT I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THAT.

06:50.410 --> 06:52.212
I LOVE YOUR DAD
FOR HIS HEART.

06:52.212 --> 06:54.915
THAT'S GOOD, BECAUSE
YOU MAY HAVE TO MASSAGE IT

06:54.915 --> 06:57.751
ON YOUR HONEYMOON
TO KEEP HIM ALIVE.

07:02.389 --> 07:05.959
ANGIE, WILL YOU RECONSIDER
AND PLAN OUR WEDDING? PLEASE?

07:05.959 --> 07:10.297
I SAW YOUR SAMPLE BOOK,
AND YOU HAVE AMAZING TASTE.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.766
WELL, IF I TAKE THIS ON,

07:12.766 --> 07:15.302
WE HAVE TO START PLANNING
RIGHT AWAY.

07:15.302 --> 07:16.804
WHEN ARE YOU FREE?

07:16.804 --> 07:19.339
I CAN DO IT ANY DAY
BUT TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS.

07:19.339 --> 07:21.141
LINDSAY'S A SAINT.
SHE VOLUNTEERS

07:21.141 --> 07:23.611
AT THE SAFE HARBOR SHELTER
FOR BATTERED WOMEN.

07:23.611 --> 07:26.780
HMM. UH, ANGIE,
CAN YOU HELP ME WITH DESSERT?

07:26.780 --> 07:29.817
SINCE WHEN DO YOU
HELP WITH DESSERT?

07:29.817 --> 07:32.620
(chuckles)
I'M INSPIRED BY THEIR LOVE.

07:35.523 --> 07:38.291
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU
INSPIRED BY LOVE?

07:38.291 --> 07:41.228
IN THE KITCHEN, WOMAN.
(groans)

07:43.997 --> 07:46.834
SO I THINK I GOT
A GOOD READ ON LINDSAY.

07:46.834 --> 07:49.970
ME, TOO. I THINK SHE'S REALLY
SWEET, AND SHE LOVES MY DAD.

07:49.970 --> 07:52.439
"SHE LOVES MY DAD."
ESTÃ¡ LOCA, "SHE LOVES MY DAD."

07:52.439 --> 07:54.341
SHE'S IN IT
FOR THE MONEY.

07:54.341 --> 07:55.909
ANGIE, SHE'S LYING
THROUGH HER TEETH.

07:55.909 --> 07:58.879
WHAT? YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

07:58.879 --> 08:01.381
ANGIE, I PLAYED ENOUGH POKER
TO SPOT SOMEONE'S TELL.

08:01.381 --> 08:04.084
EVERY TIME SHE SAID
SOMETHING THAT WASN'T TRUE,

08:04.084 --> 08:06.754
SHE PLAYED WITH HER EARRING.
SHE WAS LIKE THAT...

08:06.754 --> 08:10.223
"I LOVE YOUR DAD, VICTOR,
FOR HIS HEART."

08:12.092 --> 08:14.762
"YOU HAVE AMAZING TASTE, ANGIE.
I SAW YOUR SAMPLE BOOK."

08:14.762 --> 08:17.397
SHE WAS LIKE THAT.

08:17.397 --> 08:20.200
THAT'S WHEN I KNEW
SHE WAS LYING.

08:20.200 --> 08:23.236
I THINK YOU'RE WAY OFF BASE
ABOUT LINDSAY.

08:23.236 --> 08:25.739
AM I?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

08:25.739 --> 08:27.641
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
WHAT I'M DOING.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.309
WORRY ABOUT YOUR OWN SELF.
GEORGE!

08:29.309 --> 08:32.045
I'M GONNA PROVE TO YOU
SHE WASN'T TELLING THE TRUTH.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.047
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU FELL FOR THAT.

08:34.047 --> 08:37.818
I DIDN'T FALL FOR ANYTHING.
I THINK SHE'S BEING SINCERE.

08:37.818 --> 08:40.420
YOU KNOW WHAT, ANGIE?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

08:40.420 --> 08:43.223
WHY CAN'T I
BELIEVE PEOPLE?

08:44.892 --> 08:47.628
HOW WAS THAT?
WAS THAT SINCERE? FOOL.

08:49.963 --> 08:51.031
HELLO?

08:51.031 --> 08:53.133
YES, IS THIS
THE SAFE HARBOR SHELTER

08:53.133 --> 08:54.735
FOR BATTERED WOMEN?

08:54.735 --> 08:58.538
OH, I'M SORRY. I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT WAS AN AGGRESSIVE TONE.

09:04.945 --> 09:07.915
YES. I'M TRYING TO REACH
LINDSAY CAFFERTY.

09:07.915 --> 09:10.751
SHE VOLUNTEERS THERE
ON TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS.

09:10.751 --> 09:14.121
AHA! I KNEW IT.
SHE'S A LYING GOLD DIGGER!

09:14.121 --> 09:17.224
OH. OH, OH, NO, NOT YOU.
YOU DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

09:18.926 --> 09:21.929
LOOK, NO, NO, NO, YOU DON'T
HAVE ANYTHING COMING TO YOU.

09:21.929 --> 09:23.530
(Vic) WHAT'S GOING ON
IN HERE?

09:23.530 --> 09:27.067
VIC, I CALLED THE SHELTER WHERE
LINDSAY SAYS SHE VOLUNTEERS.

09:27.067 --> 09:30.638
THEY NEVER HEARD OF HER.
I JUST THOUGHT YOU SHOULD KNOW.

09:30.638 --> 09:33.907
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
WHY WOULD SHE LIE TO ME?

09:33.907 --> 09:36.343
LINDSAY?
MAY I SPEAK TO YOU?

09:36.343 --> 09:38.846
(Lindsay) COMING, PAPI.

09:38.846 --> 09:40.814
GEORGE JUST
CALLED THE SHELTER,

09:40.814 --> 09:43.583
AND THEY SAID
THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF YOU.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.252
DO YOU WORK THERE
OR NOT?

09:45.252 --> 09:47.755
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

09:47.755 --> 09:51.558
I NEED TO KNOW
WHERE YOU WERE.
OKAY. YOU HAVE TO KNOW, FINE.

09:51.558 --> 09:54.561
TUESDAYS AND THURSDAYS
I'VE BEEN TAKING SPANISH LESSONS

09:54.561 --> 09:58.131
SO I COULD SAY MY WEDDING VOWS
TO YOU IN YOUR LANGUAGE.

09:58.131 --> 10:02.002
PERO AHORA ARRUINASTE
MI SORPRESA.

10:02.002 --> 10:04.571
OH, SHE'S GOOD.
SHE WENT LIKE THAT...

10:04.571 --> 10:06.974
(rolls tongue)

10:09.276 --> 10:12.445
OH, LINDSAY,
I-I-I'M SO SORRY. I--

10:12.445 --> 10:17.617
MAYBE WE'RE NOT READY TO GET
MARRIED IF YOU DON'T TRUST ME.

10:17.617 --> 10:20.287
NOSY CHISMOSO.

10:22.055 --> 10:24.191
LINDSAY, LINDSAY, WAIT.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.126
PLEASE WAIT.

10:26.126 --> 10:28.028
WHAT THE HELL
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

10:28.028 --> 10:31.031
YESTERDAY YOU TOLD ME TO TRUST
MY INSTINCTS ABOUT LINDSAY,

10:31.031 --> 10:33.066
AND NOW YOU'RE
ACCUSING HER OF LYING?

10:33.066 --> 10:35.068
VIC, MAN,
SHE WAS TOUCHING HER EAR--

10:35.068 --> 10:37.838
OH! SHE'S AN EAR TOUCHER,

10:37.838 --> 10:41.574
SO I CAN'T MARRY HER NOW.
STAY OUT OF MY LIFE...

10:41.574 --> 10:44.377
YOU NOSY CHISMOSO.

10:47.147 --> 10:49.983
WELL, YOU TOTALLY MISREAD
THAT ONE.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.985
SOMETHING'S
NOT RIGHT WITH HER.

10:51.985 --> 10:53.921
ANGIE, TRUST ME.
I KNOW WOMEN.

10:53.921 --> 10:57.024
OH, YEAH? THEN WHAT AM I
THINKING RIGHT NOW?

10:57.024 --> 10:59.693
THAT I'D LIKE
TO BE MAD AT GEORGE,

10:59.693 --> 11:02.696
BUT I CAN'T
BECAUSE HE'S TOO DAMN HOT!

11:04.998 --> 11:08.035
YES,
I MUST TURN AWAY.

11:09.369 --> 11:13.073
I MUST FLEE THE ROOM
OR SURRENDER MYSELF TO HIM.

11:14.641 --> 11:17.377
AY, BUT ONE LAST STINK FACE.

11:24.785 --> 11:27.320
SO HOW DID YOU KNOW
THAT LINDSAY WAS LYING?

11:27.320 --> 11:29.122
SHE PULLED HER EAR, MAN.

11:29.122 --> 11:31.792
SHE'S GOT A TELL, DUDE.
EVERYBODY DOES.
I DON'T HAVE A TELL.

11:31.792 --> 11:34.327
DUDE, YOU GIGGLE EVERY TIME
YOU GET GOOD CARDS.

11:34.327 --> 11:35.262
NO, I DON'T.

11:37.765 --> 11:39.299
NOT MUCH HERE.

11:41.301 --> 11:43.703
(giggles)

11:43.703 --> 11:45.773
FOLD.

11:45.773 --> 11:50.110
DAMN IT.
I HAD A FULL HOUSE. GOLLY.

11:50.110 --> 11:52.145
HEY, WHAT WAS LINDSAY'S LIE,
ANYWAY?

11:52.145 --> 11:55.248
THAT SHE VOLUNTEERED
IN A BATTERED WOMEN'S SHELTER.

11:55.248 --> 11:58.919
OH, THAT WAS HER STORY?
(chuckles) SHE'S CHEATING.

11:58.919 --> 12:00.888
WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW?

12:00.888 --> 12:03.323
BECAUSE
THE LIE WAS TOO BIG.

12:03.323 --> 12:06.326
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW MANY TIMES
I HAVE TOLD MARRIED GUYS

12:06.326 --> 12:08.528
I'VE BEEN DATING--
"KEEP IT SIMPLE."

12:08.528 --> 12:11.598
SAY YOU HAD TO WORK LATE
OR YOU GOT STUCK IN TRAFFIC

12:11.598 --> 12:14.968
OR YOU HAVE TO PICK UP MILK
ON YOUR WAY HOME.

12:14.968 --> 12:17.704
OH, JEEZ. I DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW LATE IT IS.

12:17.704 --> 12:19.606
WELL, WHERE YOU GOING?

12:19.606 --> 12:23.076
TO PICK UP SOME MILK.

12:23.076 --> 12:26.013
YOU KNOW WHAT?
BENNY'S RIGHT.

12:26.013 --> 12:28.381
YEAH, YOU EVER SEEN
THE SHOW "CHEATERS"?

12:28.381 --> 12:30.984
THEY FOLLOW PEOPLE AROUND
WITH A HIDDEN CAMERA,

12:30.984 --> 12:34.721
CATCH 'EM IN BIG LIES.
THEY'RE ALWAYS CHEATING.

12:34.721 --> 12:37.057
THAT'S WHY I'M A BACHELOR.

12:37.057 --> 12:39.492
NO WOMAN'S EVER GONNA
TWO-TIME ME.

12:39.492 --> 12:43.096
DUDE, NO WOMAN'S EVER GONNA
ONE-TIME YOU.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.132
LOOK,
YOU SHOULD CALL THAT SHOW

12:45.132 --> 12:47.134
AND HAVE THEM
INVESTIGATE LINDSAY.

12:47.134 --> 12:49.069
WELL, YOU KNOW,
I GOTTA DO SOMETHING,

12:49.069 --> 12:51.104
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
EMBARRASS VIC ON TV.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.073
I'LL JUST HIRE
A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.

12:53.073 --> 12:55.943
YEAH, THAT'S GONNA COST YOU,
LIKE, $400 A DAY.

12:55.943 --> 12:57.277
"CHEATERS" PAYS YOU.

12:57.277 --> 12:59.913
YOU KNOW,
AS YOU WERE SAYING THAT,

12:59.913 --> 13:03.116
I WAS THINKING
ABOUT "CHEATERS."

13:03.116 --> 13:06.219
DID YOU GET THE WAIVERS?
THEN WE'RE CLEAR.

13:06.219 --> 13:07.855
OKAY.

13:09.756 --> 13:12.592
HI, I'M JOEY GRECO.
THANKS FOR COMING TO "CHEATERS."
HEY.

13:12.592 --> 13:16.796
LISTEN, I ONLY HAVE A FEW
MINUTES. WHAT'S YOUR STORY?
WELL,
WE THINK A FRIEND OF OURS

13:16.796 --> 13:18.465
IS GETTING CHEATED ON,
AND WE NEED PROOF.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.800
HOW LONG DO YOU THINK
SHE'S BEEN CHEATING ON YOU?

13:20.800 --> 13:23.236
OH, IT'S NOT ME, MAN.
WE REALLY ARE HERE FOR A FRIEND.

13:23.236 --> 13:26.273
GUYS, THE SHOW'S NOT CALLED
"FRIENDS OF CHEATERS."

13:26.273 --> 13:28.842
OH, OKAY.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.144
I'M THE ONE
WHO'S GETTING CHEATED ON.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.446
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY ANYTHING
BECAUSE I'M EMBARRASSED.

13:33.446 --> 13:36.683
IT'S NEVER HAPPENED TO ME.
(sniffles)

13:36.683 --> 13:39.786
JOEY,
I LOVE HER SO MUCH.

13:39.786 --> 13:43.023
HEY, TAKE IT EASY. WE'LL FOLLOW
YOUR GIRL AROUND WITH CAMERAS.

13:43.023 --> 13:45.025
WE'LL SHOW YOU
WHAT WE FIND.

13:45.025 --> 13:47.127
IF SHE IS HAVING AN AFFAIR,

13:47.127 --> 13:49.429
YOU'LL GET
TO CONFRONT HER ON TV.

13:49.429 --> 13:51.865
ALL RIGHT, BUT TELL
YOUR CENSOR TO BE READY

13:51.865 --> 13:53.266
BECAUSE I'M-A GO OFF.

13:53.266 --> 13:56.036
"I KNEW YOU WERE CHEATING.
Â¿SABES QUÃ©?

13:56.036 --> 13:58.571
BLEEP YOU
AND BLEEP, TU MADRE!"

14:00.373 --> 14:02.042
ALL RIGHT.

14:02.042 --> 14:03.676
I'M GONNA NEED SOME MORE
INFORMATION ABOUT HER.

14:03.676 --> 14:06.513
YEAH, UH, YEAH. HER NAME
IS, UH, LINDSAY CAFFERTY.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.248
SHE'S MY FIANCÃ©E.

14:11.684 --> 14:13.453
OH, YEAH,
SHE'S CHEATING.

14:13.453 --> 14:17.557
LIKE YOU'RE A CATCH, MAN.
IS YOUR GIRLFRIEND THAT HOT?

14:17.557 --> 14:19.459
YOU TELL ME. THAT'S HER.

14:21.061 --> 14:24.197
OH.
OH.

14:26.934 --> 14:29.236
WHATEVER.
I DON'T EVEN LIKE BLONDES.

14:29.236 --> 14:31.304
BUT YOUR FIANCÃ©E'S BLONDE.

14:31.304 --> 14:35.075
YEAH, AND WOULD I BE HERE
IF WE WEREN'T HAVING PROBLEMS?

14:39.879 --> 14:42.015
GEORGE, GEORGE, GEORGE,

14:42.015 --> 14:44.517
THE CREW FROM "CHEATERS"
JUST PULLED UP.

14:44.517 --> 14:47.854
I CAN'T WAIT
TO SEE WHAT THEY FOUND.

14:47.854 --> 14:50.457
WHY ARE YOU SQUINTING?

14:50.457 --> 14:53.160
DUDE,
ARE YOU WEARING MAKEUP?

14:54.962 --> 14:57.097
I WANNA LOOK GOOD ON TV,

14:57.097 --> 14:59.866
BUT I GOT SOME MASCARA
IN MY EYE.

14:59.866 --> 15:02.002
IT BURNS LIKE HELL,
GEORGE.

15:03.603 --> 15:05.738
Ã³RALE, "TRANNY 911."

15:05.738 --> 15:07.240
WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ON TV,
MAN.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.977
WE'RE GONNA GET
THE EVIDENCE FOR VIC,

15:09.977 --> 15:11.979
AND THEN WE'RE GONNA
BAIL OUT.

15:11.979 --> 15:13.313
(knock on door)

15:17.250 --> 15:19.219
HEY, GEORGE.
HEY, JOEY.

15:19.219 --> 15:21.354
ARE YOU READY TO DO THIS?

15:21.354 --> 15:22.189
YEAH.

15:22.189 --> 15:24.924
OKAY. ALL RIGHT, HERE.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.259
ROLL.

15:26.259 --> 15:29.362
I GUESS IT'S TIME
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

15:34.901 --> 15:39.906
WE STARTED FOLLOWING LINDSAY
A FEW DAYS AGO. NOW--
(door opens)

15:39.906 --> 15:42.209
OH, ANGIE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:42.209 --> 15:45.145
THE CATERER
HAD TO CANCEL.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.084
WHY IS THERE
A CAMERA CREW HERE?

15:51.084 --> 15:55.155
(gasps) IS IT
THE HOME MAKEOVER SHOW?

15:55.155 --> 15:57.057
WHO'S THIS?

15:57.057 --> 15:59.659
UH, UH,
THIS IS MY SISTER ANGIE.

15:59.659 --> 16:01.794
ANGIE,
IT'S--IT'S TIME YOU KNEW.

16:01.794 --> 16:04.264
I THOUGHT MY FIANCÃ©E LINDSAY
WAS CHEATING ON ME,

16:04.264 --> 16:07.334
SO I CALLED "CHEATERS"
TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF IT.

16:08.601 --> 16:11.471
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.
YOU ARE SUCH AN IDIOT.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.007
UH, NO, YOU ARE,
BOOGER-FACE MONSTER.

16:14.007 --> 16:15.542
SISTERS, HUH?

16:17.077 --> 16:20.313
OKAY, WE FOLLOWED LINDSAY
FOR A FEW DAYS.

16:20.313 --> 16:23.150
AT FIRST WE THOUGHT YOU HAD
NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT,

16:23.150 --> 16:25.418
AND THEN SHE MET THIS MAN...

16:30.157 --> 16:32.225
THAT'S DADDY.

16:36.863 --> 16:40.300
SO YOUR FIANCÃ©E'S
CHEATING ON YOU WITH YOUR DAD?

16:40.300 --> 16:42.269
HE'S FAMILY, MAN.
WE'RE COOL WITH THAT.

16:42.269 --> 16:44.904
WHAT ELSE YOU GOT?

16:44.904 --> 16:48.908
I THINK
WE'VE SEEN ENOUGH.

16:48.908 --> 16:50.777
WHY ARE YOU PUSHING THIS?

16:50.777 --> 16:53.680
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST ADMIT
YOU WERE WRONG ABOUT LINDSAY?

16:53.680 --> 16:56.449
LOOK, ANGIE, I WAS TRYING
TO MAKE YOUR DAD FEEL BETTER,

16:56.449 --> 16:58.418
AND HE TORE UP HIS PRENUP
BECAUSE OF ME,

16:58.418 --> 17:00.487
SO WE HAVE
TO KNOW FOR SURE.

17:00.487 --> 17:03.690
EXCUSE ME,
BUT SHE MET ANOTHER MAN.

17:11.064 --> 17:15.102
OH, NO.
YOU WERE RIGHT.

17:15.102 --> 17:18.771
OH, NO!
NOT THE "CHEATERS" GUYS AGAIN!

17:32.152 --> 17:35.088
JOEY, I TOLD YOU
FOR THE LAST TIME,

17:35.088 --> 17:37.157
LEAVE ME ALONE!

17:44.164 --> 17:46.166
HOW ARE WE GONNA
TELL MY DAD?

17:46.166 --> 17:48.868
FIRST MY MOM CHEATED ON HIM
AND NOW LINDSAY.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.903
THIS IS GONNA KILL HIM.

17:50.903 --> 17:53.606
YOU COULD JUST BLURT IT OUT,
BREAK HIS HEART

17:53.606 --> 17:55.742
AND TAKE A PICTURE
OF HIM.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.510
THAT'S THELOPEZ WAY.

17:59.346 --> 18:02.815
YOU ARE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
WHAT JUST HAPPENED.

18:02.815 --> 18:06.586
LET'S MAKE IT A GAME.
I BET I CAN TOP YOU.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.723
I JUST SPENT THREE HOURS
ON THE PHONE WITH YOUR MOTHER.

18:10.723 --> 18:13.826
REALLY? I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU TWO WERE TALKING.

18:13.826 --> 18:16.829
WELL, I DIDN'T WANT HER
TO HEAR FROM SOMEONE ELSE

18:16.829 --> 18:19.799
THAT I WAS GETTING MARRIED
AGAIN, BUT AFTER I TOLD HER,

18:19.799 --> 18:22.969
SHE BROKE DOWN AND SAID
SHE MADE A MISTAKE LEAVING ME.

18:22.969 --> 18:24.671
CAN YOU BELIEVE IT?

18:24.671 --> 18:26.306
SHE EVEN ASKED ME
TO TAKE HER BACK.

18:26.306 --> 18:28.308
THAT'S GREAT.
IS IT?

18:28.308 --> 18:31.811
I MEAN, I REALIZED I NEVER
STOPPED LOVING EMELINA,

18:31.811 --> 18:34.481
BUT I LOVE LINDSAY, TOO.
WHO DO I CHOOSE?

18:34.481 --> 18:36.483
EMELINA.
EMELINA.

18:39.719 --> 18:44.123
BUT IF I GO BACK TO EMELINA,
IT'S GOING TO DEVASTATE LINDSAY.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.459
YEAH,
YOU MIGHT BE SURPRISED, VIC.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.795
UH, SHE'S PRETTY FLEXIBLE.

18:50.730 --> 18:55.568
IT'S WONDERFUL, BUT IT'S
TERRIBLE AT THE SAME TIME...

18:55.568 --> 18:59.672
DADDY, I KNOW LINDSAY
IS YOUNG AND PRETTY,

18:59.672 --> 19:03.109
BUT WHAT YOU HAVE WITH MAMI
IS SO MUCH DEEPER.

19:03.109 --> 19:05.111
DON'T THROW THAT AWAY.

19:05.111 --> 19:07.079
WELL,
ONE THING IS FOR SURE--

19:07.079 --> 19:08.915
WE HAVE TO PUT
THE WEDDING ON HOLD.

19:08.915 --> 19:12.018
ANGIE, LOOK, WOULD YOU CALL
THE CATERER AND EVERYONE FOR ME?
DONE.

19:12.018 --> 19:14.921
HEY, GEORGE.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.690
THERE'S NO WAY

19:17.690 --> 19:20.993
I CAN GET AN IMPARTIAL ANSWER
FROM MY DAUGHTER.

19:20.993 --> 19:24.297
AM I A FOOL TO GO BACK
TO A WOMAN WHO CHEATED ON ME?

19:24.297 --> 19:27.800
WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET
OVER THAT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER.

19:31.838 --> 19:34.441
WHAT--WHAT--WHAT--
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

19:34.441 --> 19:36.376
NOTHING. EMELINA'S LUCKY
TO HAVE YOU, MAN.

19:36.376 --> 19:38.478
YOU'RE A GREAT GUY.

19:39.746 --> 19:43.516
GEORGE, YOU'RE LYING.
I KNOW YOUR TELL.

19:43.516 --> 19:45.852
VIC,
I DON'T HAVE A TELL.
OH, YES, YOU DO.

19:45.852 --> 19:49.689
YOU LOOK AWAY, COCK YOUR HEAD
AND SAY SOMETHING NICE TO ME.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.392
THAT IS
AN EXCELLENT OBSERVATION.

19:52.392 --> 19:54.594
YOU ARE A BRIGHT MAN.

19:58.265 --> 20:00.633
ALL RIGHT.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.335
OUT WITH IT.

20:03.736 --> 20:06.105
LOOK, I...
DIDN'T TRUST LINDSAY,

20:06.105 --> 20:09.242
SO I CALLED THIS TV SHOW
THAT FOLLOWS PEOPLE AROUND.

20:09.242 --> 20:11.944
THEY FOUND HER
CHEATING ON YOU, MAN.

20:11.944 --> 20:13.746
IT'S ALL ON TAPE.

20:13.746 --> 20:16.916
YOU FORGOT TO LOOK AWAY
AND COCK YOUR HEAD.

20:18.518 --> 20:20.520
I KNOW, MAN.
I'M SORRY, VIC.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.689
I DON'T BELIEVE IT.

20:22.689 --> 20:26.526
SHE WAS LYING TO ME
THE WHOLE TIME.

20:26.526 --> 20:28.995
OH, FORGET HER, VIC.
YOU'RE GETTING EMELINA BACK.

20:28.995 --> 20:31.831
MAN, THE LOVE OF YOUR LIFE,
MOTHER OF YOUR CHILDREN.

20:31.831 --> 20:35.502
EH,
OWNER OF HALF YOUR STUFF!

20:38.571 --> 20:42.642
YOU CAN GET
SOME GOOD CLOTHES BACK.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.780
WELL,
I DO REALLY MISS HER.

20:47.780 --> 20:51.918
HEY, THANK YOU FOR HAVING
MY BACK ON THIS ONE.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.786
YOU GOT IT, MAN.

20:53.786 --> 20:57.290
YOU KNOW,
IT'S HARD TO ADMIT,

20:57.290 --> 20:59.559
BUT I WAS ALWAYS WORRIED

20:59.559 --> 21:03.863
THAT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE
TO KEEP LINDSAY SATISFIED.

21:03.863 --> 21:06.098
WHAT?

21:06.098 --> 21:09.602
VIC, IF ANYBODY CAN, YOU CAN.
BROTHER, YOU'RE A STUD.
