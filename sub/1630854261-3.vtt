How was your weekend

00:55.229 --> 00:57.361
Rome? Oh, no. He got
a little hotep-y,

00:57.405 --> 00:59.146
so he's on
time-out right now.

00:59.189 --> 01:02.018
And you gonna tell me
where you were last night?

01:02.062 --> 01:03.280
In heaven.

01:03.324 --> 01:04.890
Professor: Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen.

01:04.934 --> 01:07.067
Welcome to the first week
of classes.

01:07.110 --> 01:09.895
As we are coming off
the Martin Luther King Holiday,

01:09.939 --> 01:12.072
it should come as no surprise
that we're starting

01:12.115 --> 01:14.683
this semester off on the subject
of the good reverend.

01:14.726 --> 01:18.861
Your first assignment
will focus not on King

01:18.904 --> 01:20.906
but on the men and women
who walked with him,

01:20.950 --> 01:23.344
people whose names aren't
as well-known to history

01:23.387 --> 01:26.738
but without whom the movement
wouldn't have succeeded.

01:26.782 --> 01:28.871
So, yes, we were Kings,

01:28.914 --> 01:31.613
but we were also
Cottons, Youngs...

01:31.656 --> 01:32.657
Abernathys.

01:32.701 --> 01:34.572
Professor: Exactly.

01:45.148 --> 01:46.367
Aqueelah.

01:46.410 --> 01:47.977
J.R., how are you?

01:48.020 --> 01:49.848
J.R.: Good. I actually
wanted to holla at you

01:49.892 --> 01:51.589
about a joint
KEK/PKZ thing.

01:51.633 --> 01:53.722
You can just email me.

01:56.986 --> 01:59.162
Look, that wasn't--
it was just really--

01:59.206 --> 02:01.425
OK, we used to date.

02:01.469 --> 02:02.948
Yeah, I could feel
the love.

02:02.992 --> 02:05.125
You're in my T.A. section
for this course,

02:05.168 --> 02:06.909
so here's
some extra reading.

02:06.952 --> 02:09.041
Wait. You're in engineering?
I thought you was a singer.

02:09.085 --> 02:10.913
You're in engineering?
I thought you were
an athlete.

02:10.956 --> 02:12.523
You see how that
works?

02:12.567 --> 02:15.135
OK. Heh.

02:15.178 --> 02:17.180
When people think
about the Birmingham
bus boycotts,

02:17.224 --> 02:19.922
they think about
Rosa Parks and Dr. King,

02:19.965 --> 02:21.619
but there was
a teenage girl named

02:21.663 --> 02:23.795
Claudette Colvin
who refused to
leave her seat

02:23.839 --> 02:25.449
9 months before Parks.

02:25.493 --> 02:27.712
And local activists
E.D. Nixon

02:27.756 --> 02:29.627
and Jo Ann Robinson

02:29.671 --> 02:31.281
led the charge to
challenge segregation

02:31.325 --> 02:32.804
on those buses
in 1956.

02:32.848 --> 02:34.458
So they should be
credited

02:34.502 --> 02:35.981
for the boycott's
success as well.

02:36.025 --> 02:37.896
I don't know if...
[Chuckles]

02:37.940 --> 02:40.029
I would actually say
it was a success.

02:40.072 --> 02:42.074
It eliminated
discrimination

02:42.118 --> 02:43.641
in mass transit

02:43.685 --> 02:45.687
and kicked off
the Civil Rights movement.

02:45.730 --> 02:47.602
But a lot of Black
small businesses

02:47.645 --> 02:49.647
couldn't compete once folks
would go to the bigger
White-owned stores.

02:49.691 --> 02:51.258
But that's not what
we're talking about.

02:51.301 --> 02:52.737
Well, maybe you should be.

02:52.781 --> 02:54.739
My family came
from Birmingham.

02:54.783 --> 02:56.263
And two years after
the boycott,

02:56.306 --> 02:58.003
my great-uncle's car service
business went bankrupt.

02:58.047 --> 03:00.005
So what, you're
pro-segregation?

03:00.049 --> 03:03.574
No. Look, I just think
there's a conversation

03:03.618 --> 03:05.315
about whether integration

03:05.359 --> 03:08.666
undercut the unity
and financial stability
of the community.

03:08.710 --> 03:10.886
An all-Black environment
has its rewards.

03:10.929 --> 03:13.193
Case in point: the HBCU
we're in right now.

03:13.236 --> 03:15.673
See, not everything
is so simplistic.

03:15.717 --> 03:18.198
[Soft laughter]

03:18.241 --> 03:20.243
No one said anything
about simplistic.

03:20.287 --> 03:21.853
Professor: OK, good points
all around,

03:21.897 --> 03:23.246
but we're out of time.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.595
More to come.

03:24.639 --> 03:28.338
Hey, so, uh,
that was fun.

03:28.382 --> 03:29.861
I'm, um--

03:29.905 --> 03:31.080
The dude who tried
to mansplain me

03:31.123 --> 03:32.516
in front of
the entire class?

03:32.560 --> 03:34.518
See, now, what you
call mansplaining

03:34.562 --> 03:36.041
I just call healthy debate.

03:36.085 --> 03:37.913
Well, I mean, I'm open
to a healthy debate,

03:37.956 --> 03:40.263
but next time, just leave
your simplistic arrogance

03:40.307 --> 03:42.047
and ego at home.

03:44.267 --> 03:46.791
Nathaniel: Well, damn.
You didn't have
to snatch his wig.

03:46.835 --> 03:48.184
You could've just
asked for it.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.186
I am done letting people
walk all over me.

03:50.230 --> 03:52.275
Not Tootie
and not anyone else.

03:52.319 --> 03:54.059
And this semester,
I am embracing

03:54.103 --> 03:57.541
my inner bad bitch
on and off the court.

04:05.549 --> 04:06.942

04:06.985 --> 04:08.465
Nothing to figure out.
He's the coach.

04:08.509 --> 04:11.251
Hey, you think

Now, you all ready to win?

04:31.445 --> 04:33.098
-Yes, sir!
-All right!

04:33.142 --> 04:35.797
OK, we got one more
team member to introduce.

04:35.840 --> 04:38.060
I want you all to give
a warm welcome

04:38.103 --> 04:41.411
to former Hawkins pitcher
and new Lions starter

04:41.455 --> 04:42.847
Lando Johnson.

04:42.891 --> 04:44.893
[Applause]

04:44.936 --> 04:46.634
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

04:46.677 --> 04:48.288
I'm so excited to be here
at Bringston.

04:48.331 --> 04:49.985
It's been a dream
since I was a kid.

04:50.028 --> 04:53.075
And I promise, I'mma give
everything to this team.

04:53.118 --> 04:56.948
OK. All right, fellas,
let's go. Out to the field.

04:56.992 --> 04:58.994
Let's go. Let's go.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.651
So for our first match,
we'll be hosting

05:03.694 --> 05:04.956
Willis-Cobb University.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.567
I'm sure you recall

05:06.610 --> 05:09.265
they were supposed to merge
with Bringston last semester,

05:09.309 --> 05:11.833
so there may be some
residual hard feelings.

05:11.876 --> 05:15.184
Rise above. Let's start
with backhand drills.

05:17.491 --> 05:19.884
Ooh. My bad.

05:23.192 --> 05:24.498
Hey.

05:24.541 --> 05:26.369
So I've been watching
a ton of Willis-Cobb matches

05:26.413 --> 05:28.719
just to kind of
get a sense of their
strengths and weaknesses.

05:28.763 --> 05:30.199
You want to meet up
later tonight?

05:30.242 --> 05:32.288
I'm happy to go over it
with you guys.

05:32.332 --> 05:35.117
When you say
"you guys," does that
also include them?

05:35.160 --> 05:38.816
Simone: Oh, please.
Tootie and her crew
made it very clear

05:38.860 --> 05:41.471
that they're not about
this team life, so no.

05:41.515 --> 05:43.908
They will not be getting
any extra help from me.

05:43.952 --> 05:46.128
What the hell do you
think you're doing?

05:46.171 --> 05:47.738
So when was you
gonna mention

05:47.782 --> 05:49.349
that you recruited
another pitcher?

05:49.392 --> 05:51.742
Look, I did what was
best for the team.

05:51.786 --> 05:53.918
It was your decision
to leave, Damon.

05:53.962 --> 05:55.616
Once he had you, Shaw
agreed to release Lando,

05:55.659 --> 05:57.095
so I scooped him up.

05:57.139 --> 05:58.401
I didn't know you'd come
back at the last minute.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.185
So how is this
supposed to work?

06:00.229 --> 06:01.883
Who's pitching this
week's opening game?

06:01.926 --> 06:04.189
I made a promise to Lando
when I recruited him

06:04.233 --> 06:05.800
that he'd be Bringston's
ace pitcher.

06:05.843 --> 06:07.671
I'm not going back on that.

06:07.715 --> 06:09.107
So he's gonna pitch
the opener,

06:09.151 --> 06:11.153
and you will be number 2.

06:11.196 --> 06:13.329
Number 2? What, you want
me to pitch behind Lando
because what?

06:13.373 --> 06:16.506
You suddenly decide
that you want to be
a person of character?

06:16.550 --> 06:20.336
Have you lost your mind?
I ain't nobody's number 2?

06:28.257 --> 06:29.693
I just can't tell
if I should be, like,

06:29.737 --> 06:31.826
excited or sick or,
I don't know, both.

06:31.869 --> 06:34.132
I have to prove myself
every single day in class,

06:34.176 --> 06:36.526
and I have to re-audition
at the end of the semester

06:36.570 --> 06:38.310
just to stay a dance major.

06:38.354 --> 06:42.010
Damn. But, again,
not worried.

06:42.053 --> 06:44.142
You convinced her once.
You'll convince her again.

06:44.186 --> 06:46.449
I'm just glad for now
that you have a schedule

06:46.493 --> 06:47.624
you're happy with

By the time I
cleared up that whole
registration mess,

06:51.628 --> 06:53.717
there was only one
music class still open.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.023

musical theater.

clown me?

to be supportive.

supportive?

07:17.872 --> 07:20.178
You won't answer
any calls or texts.

07:20.222 --> 07:22.311

this notification that

you're not enrolled

the conversation

we started at Christmas.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.928
Well, I have nothing
left to say.

07:30.972 --> 07:32.800
And I cleared up that
enrollment stuff,

07:32.843 --> 07:33.931
so I'm registered now.

07:33.975 --> 07:35.367
OK. For how long?

Cameron?

introduce myself.

like this,

to talk.

to go in there.

I should be part of
the conversation.

being around students.

Well, you got
family dinner.

09:14.815 --> 09:16.599
You say the word,
and I'll pack that joint
out with more of us.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.688
Aw. Not unless you all
learn how to do more

09:18.732 --> 09:20.211
than boil rice.

09:20.255 --> 09:21.343
You know
we beat your rice.

09:21.386 --> 09:22.605
-Mm.
-Dr. Patterson.

09:22.649 --> 09:24.215
I've been looking for you.

found me, Mister...?

09:27.479 --> 09:29.438

Government Association.

to set a meeting with you

09:31.135 --> 09:32.702
to discuss SGA business.

09:32.746 --> 09:34.617
Oh, it's been a busy time.

09:34.661 --> 09:36.401
Traditionally,
Student Government meets

09:36.445 --> 09:38.055
with the president
a week before classes start.

We're behind schedule.

was important to you.

Um, excuse me.

09:43.191 --> 09:44.671
My aunt said what she said.

She's busy, and she is
with a student--me.

09:48.370 --> 09:50.459
So why don't you make
your appointment

09:50.502 --> 09:52.461
and let us finish
our conversation?

09:59.468 --> 10:01.992
Someone's feeling
feisty today.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.820
No. I'm sensitive
to disrespect these days.

with Tootie and the girls?

I'm not gonna let them
distract me

10:10.305 --> 10:12.568
or drive me away
from what I love.

10:12.612 --> 10:15.092

carry ourselves

10:15.136 --> 10:17.486

the remaining total, and so

10:20.489 --> 10:22.883
I applied for a grant
that's covering
most of my tuition,

10:22.926 --> 10:25.755
and I got a work-study job
with President Patterson.

10:25.799 --> 10:28.628
That plus odd jobs are
covering everything else.

10:28.671 --> 10:30.891
Does this grant cover
you for all 4 years?

10:30.934 --> 10:31.892
No.

have been talking.

10:36.374 --> 10:40.465
And if football truly
is over for you,

10:40.509 --> 10:44.818
then we think it's best
that you move back to L.A.

10:44.861 --> 10:46.689
Bringston is where I belong.

10:46.733 --> 10:49.649
And I even found
something that I love

10:49.692 --> 10:50.824
as much as football.

10:50.867 --> 10:52.260

I don't return your calls.

I don't need your sarcasm
or your criticism.

this afternoon

with the ATLs after that.

in town for?

to be me and you,

playing backup?

We'll both just have
to adjust, OK?

11:49.012 --> 11:50.361
Maybe you should
reach out to Lando

and welcome him on the team.

11:51.798 --> 11:53.103
What?

Nate hiding,

to respond to my texts?

to play me in front

Actually,
I was talking to her.

we should be
completely honest.

made you starter

Nathaniel: You don't
know that it was him.

40:44.746 --> 40:46.444
Maybe you shouldn't
spread rumors
without receipts.

40:46.487 --> 40:48.576
Amara: OK, it doesn't matter.
The point--

40:48.620 --> 40:50.926
I'm sorry, Dr. P. Nate,
why are you defending him?

40:50.970 --> 40:53.102
He broke your heart.

40:53.146 --> 40:55.670
Damon: Yo, who is this Nico
guy? What's going on now?

40:55.714 --> 40:58.673
Nico was m--

40:58.717 --> 41:00.501
[Sighs]

41:00.545 --> 41:03.156
Nico is my boyfriend.

41:04.157 --> 41:05.854
We're back together.

41:05.898 --> 41:07.595
Wait. And you...

41:07.639 --> 41:09.118
you kept that from me?

41:09.162 --> 41:10.946
Nate, he's a narcissist.

41:10.990 --> 41:14.123
He made you cry for weeks.
What are you doing...

41:14.167 --> 41:15.429
Cam: Keisha, chill.
Keisha: Don't talk to me.

41:15.473 --> 41:16.735
Cam: What?
Simone: Keisha.

41:16.778 --> 41:18.824
You don't got to date him.

41:18.867 --> 41:20.042
You gonna answer
my question?

41:20.086 --> 41:22.784
Amara: OK, enough. Enough!

41:22.828 --> 41:24.873
Enough.

41:24.917 --> 41:27.180
Whether it was Nico or not,

41:27.223 --> 41:30.139
the person was right
about one thing:

41:30.183 --> 41:34.143
these dinners give you
unfair access to me

41:34.187 --> 41:35.536
as Bringston's president.

41:35.580 --> 41:38.365
Wait, wait. What are you
saying, Dr. P.?

41:39.932 --> 41:43.239
Tonight was
our last family dinner.

42:22.583 --> 42:24.542
Greg, move your head.
