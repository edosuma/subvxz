{\an8}(Kimbella)
Previously on
"Love &amp; Hip Hop"...

00:05.338 --> 00:07.140
{\an7}Me and Yandy
are no longer friends.

00:07.207 --> 00:10.477
{\an8}She texted me about
Juelz being in jail.

00:10.543 --> 00:12.912
{\an7}Like, "I'm here for you."
Like, no, you're not.

00:12.979 --> 00:15.982
{\an8}Until you own who the (bleep)
you are, we don't need to have

00:16.049 --> 00:18.885
{\an7}another (bleep) conversation.
Good night.

00:18.952 --> 00:22.255
{\an7}You keep giving these (bleep)
other (bleep) to talk about

00:22.322 --> 00:24.424
{\an8}outside of
your God-given talent.

00:24.491 --> 00:28.128
{\an8}You just move wrong.
Don't do this (bleep)
no more, man.

00:28.194 --> 00:30.997
{\an7}Jaquae was saying that
Safaree had gotten robbed.

00:31.064 --> 00:36.436
{\an7}He told me that he feels like
it's an insurance thing, like
it's fake.

00:36.503 --> 00:38.705
{\an8}You don't think
I really got robbed.

00:38.772 --> 00:44.144
{\an8}You think it's an
insurance scam
that I'm doing.

00:38.772 --> 00:44.144
{\an4}What?

00:44.210 --> 00:45.512
{\an8}Everything is my fault.

00:45.578 --> 00:47.247
{\an8}The whole time you say
I was on drugs,

00:47.313 --> 00:48.481
{\an8}you said we wasn't
together.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.784
{\an7}What kind of (bleep)
excuse is that for a man?

00:50.850 --> 00:55.655
{\an7}And if that's how you feel,
then let's end it now!

00:55.722 --> 00:58.558
{\an7}You doubted that I have class,
so where's your class?

00:58.625 --> 01:01.327
{\an8}This bitch about to...

00:58.625 --> 01:01.327
{\an8}Everybody shut up!

01:01.394 --> 01:06.199
{\an7}It was not only Anais' (bleep)
fault why your (bleep) funeral
didn't happen, bitch!

01:06.266 --> 01:08.535
{\an8}You really need to
reevaluate yourself.

01:06.266 --> 01:08.535
{\an5}You too, Kimba.

01:08.601 --> 01:11.037
{\an7}What? No. I don't need to do
nothing, 'cause what I'm doing

01:11.104 --> 01:13.072
{\an7}is keeping it real and I'm
cutting (bleep) out of my life

01:13.139 --> 01:15.875
{\an8}that don't belong there.
Let's leave it at that.

01:13.139 --> 01:15.875
{\an4}All right.

01:15.942 --> 01:18.878
{\an8}♪♪

01:46.005 --> 01:48.308
{\an8}♪♪

01:48.374 --> 01:50.977
{\an8}Say hi, baby.

01:48.374 --> 01:50.977
{\an7}Who do you want
to babysit?

01:51.044 --> 01:54.347
{\an8}He's a happy boy.
He's a happy boy.

01:54.414 --> 01:56.749
{\an8}This is Aunt Leslie.
This is Aunt Leslie.

01:56.816 --> 02:01.888
{\an8}Ever since I've gotten into
the social scene, it's been
drama after drama after drama.

02:01.955 --> 02:07.193
{\an5}Between Jonathan and that whole
mess and Jaquae talking about
Safaree's robbery was a fraud,

02:07.260 --> 02:11.297
{\an5}child, I don't know what to
believe. I need a break from all
that, so today, I'm gonna spend

02:11.364 --> 02:16.736
{\an5}some time with my baby sisters,
but first, let me put this
sleepy baby down for a nap.

02:16.803 --> 02:19.305
{\an8}♪♪

02:19.372 --> 02:24.677
{\an8}I thought whisking Cyn away
to a romantic vacation would
give me some special treatment

02:24.744 --> 02:29.015
{\an5}around the house,
but as usual, she's got me
cleaning up the mess.

02:29.082 --> 02:31.651
If I didn't know any better,
I would think that she's got,

02:31.718 --> 02:34.387
like, an allergic reaction
to any house work.

02:34.454 --> 02:38.157
{\an4}Let me see your nails.
They're so cute.

02:34.454 --> 02:38.157
{\an3}Thank you.

02:38.224 --> 02:40.026
{\an5}She got a little diamond.

02:38.224 --> 02:40.026
I see that.

02:40.093 --> 02:41.594
Which diamond
are you talking about?

02:41.661 --> 02:42.996
This little diamond.

02:41.661 --> 02:42.996
{\an3}(laughs)

02:43.062 --> 02:47.734
Why is girl stuff
so hard to grab?

02:50.069 --> 02:52.639
{\an5}That's a promise ring, bitch.

02:50.069 --> 02:52.639
Okay, well, what do you have?

02:52.705 --> 02:57.343
{\an1}First comes love,
then comes the baby,

02:57.410 --> 02:59.913
{\an1}then comes marriage
and the carriage.

02:59.979 --> 03:02.048
{\an5}Like, it's about time.

02:59.979 --> 03:02.048
Yeah.

03:02.115 --> 03:03.816
{\an5}Is it about time?

03:02.115 --> 03:03.816
It's definitely about time.

03:03.883 --> 03:06.119
It was about time maybe what,
like, maybe a year ago?

03:06.185 --> 03:07.854
{\an5}A baby ago.

03:06.185 --> 03:07.854
{\an3}A baby ago.

03:07.921 --> 03:09.389
(laughter)

03:09.455 --> 03:11.291
{\an1}Y'all can definitely sit down
with y'all brother-in-law

03:11.357 --> 03:13.092
and be like, so what's
going on with my sis?

03:13.159 --> 03:16.829
{\an8}(speaking Spanish)

03:16.896 --> 03:18.298
{\an1}Hello.

03:16.896 --> 03:18.298
{\an3}<i>Hola!</i>

03:18.364 --> 03:20.300
{\an3}Hi,<i> papi!</i>

03:20.366 --> 03:22.936
<i>Hola, negro!</i>

03:23.002 --> 03:24.704
{\an3}<i>Cómo está?</i>

03:24.771 --> 03:27.407
{\an5}Wait. Ew! Give me a kiss.

03:24.771 --> 03:27.407
{\an3}(laughs)

03:27.473 --> 03:29.442
{\an5}You look good.

03:27.473 --> 03:29.442
You got some <i> tostones?</i>

03:29.509 --> 03:32.278
{\an5}You want some <i> tostones?</i>

03:29.509 --> 03:32.278
No, not yet.
I'm dying of thirst.

03:32.345 --> 03:34.714
{\an8}(speaking Spanish)

03:34.781 --> 03:38.818
{\an5}You don't want <i> tostones.</i>
What do you want
from your wife?

03:38.885 --> 03:43.022
{\an5}Oh, I said the wrong word.
I mean your girlfriend.

03:38.885 --> 03:43.022
{\an1}(laughs)

03:43.089 --> 03:45.058
{\an3}No, wifey.

03:43.089 --> 03:45.058
But without a ring?

03:45.124 --> 03:46.593
{\an3}No, "fey."

03:45.124 --> 03:46.593
{\an1}Fey?

03:46.659 --> 03:48.695
{\an1}Fey. You put "fey" on the end
when there's no ring yet.

03:48.761 --> 03:50.229
{\an1}Oh, okay.

03:48.761 --> 03:50.229
See? Wi-fey.

03:50.296 --> 03:52.865
Oh, Wi-fey. All right,
so we'll take the "fey" out.

03:52.932 --> 03:54.467
And then we work
our way gradually.

03:54.534 --> 03:56.869
{\an5}Because, listen, Joe,
look at Leslie's cute
little promise ring.

03:56.936 --> 03:59.305
{\an1}You know,
she gonna get married.

03:59.372 --> 04:02.976
{\an5}My baby sister Leslie's
22 years old. She's got
four years with her man

04:03.042 --> 04:08.448
{\an5}and she already got
a little promise ring, and
here I am with a baby and...

04:08.514 --> 04:11.618
{\an8}(speaking Spanish)

04:11.684 --> 04:13.419
What is...? Damn!

04:13.486 --> 04:17.290
{\an5}I'm trying to be...

04:13.486 --> 04:17.290
It's about time. Like,
she had a baby for you.

04:17.357 --> 04:24.864
{\an5}I will propose when I am ready
and when I feel the time is
right, and hopefully that's

04:24.931 --> 04:30.236
{\an5}when Cyn decides to take some of
her wifely duties around the
house a bit more seriously.

04:30.303 --> 04:34.207
{\an4}Take your little dusty
ass to the car and drive
to Zales, chop-chop.

04:34.273 --> 04:38.778
{\an5}Zales. Nothing that
will measure my love
is in Zales.

04:38.845 --> 04:42.382
{\an8}(all speaking Spanish)

04:48.021 --> 04:50.390
I'm out of here.
(laughs)

04:50.456 --> 04:54.627
{\an5}Don't interrupt sissy talk.

04:50.456 --> 04:54.627
Trust me, never again.

04:54.694 --> 04:58.631
{\an8}♪♪

05:01.267 --> 05:05.505
{\an5}Joe! Street!

05:01.267 --> 05:05.505
Hey, you don't look street.

05:05.571 --> 05:10.209
{\an5}After our last talk, I kind of
thought that Safaree would get
his act together, but nope!

05:10.276 --> 05:16.115
{\an5}Here he is, yet again,
getting attention for
everything but music.

05:16.182 --> 05:19.218
{\an5}I hate that I gotta
sound like the old dad
every time I see you.

05:19.285 --> 05:23.690
{\an4}Last time I saw you, you
said you was done flipping
out on the Internet, right?

05:23.756 --> 05:25.491
{\an1}Yeah. I haven't flipped out
on the Internet, though.

05:25.558 --> 05:28.061
{\an5}You just flipped out
on the Internet.

05:25.558 --> 05:28.061
No, I didn't.

05:28.127 --> 05:30.296
{\an1}I expressed some things.
I didn't flip out.

05:30.363 --> 05:34.067
{\an8}You talking about the time
when he got me in trouble
with Nicki Minaj?

05:34.133 --> 05:37.937
{\an8}Look, here's how it really
went down. You know, Self,
he was on the radio.

05:38.004 --> 05:43.576
{\an8}He said Cardi had the best album
of the year. My ex felt her way,
went on a Twitter rampage,

05:43.643 --> 05:47.180
insulted him, his whole roster,
and then the next day,

05:47.246 --> 05:50.283
{\an5}she had an interview
and then said a whole
bunch of lies about me.

05:50.349 --> 05:55.088
{\an5}Had the nerve to say
I stole her credit card,
went and paid for my hair line,

05:55.154 --> 05:59.892
{\an8}paid for prostitutes and a whole
bunch of other nonsense, and it
spiraled into a back and forth,

05:59.959 --> 06:03.429
and of course,
the whole thing went viral.

06:03.496 --> 06:07.633
{\an1}With that level of accusation,
I had to defend myself.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.168
{\an5}There's a big difference.

06:07.700 --> 06:09.168
{\an1}Yeah.

06:09.235 --> 06:13.740
Beefing with one of the biggest
female rappers in the world

06:13.806 --> 06:17.877
just is not conducive to
anything positive.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.079
{\an5}Smoke came to us.

06:17.944 --> 06:20.079
Why would someone lie?

06:20.146 --> 06:22.615
{\an5}You gonna run around
and defend yourself
to every lie?

06:22.682 --> 06:25.118
When someone is as big
a star as her, yes.

06:25.184 --> 06:27.320
Mariahlynn jumped in this
whole... Y'all had a whole

06:27.386 --> 06:31.924
little, like, shenanigan
circus going on.

06:31.991 --> 06:36.362
{\an5}Well, Mariahlynn jumped in
because I think that she felt
like, how is this girl...

06:36.429 --> 06:39.098
{\an4}A shot was thrown
at the roster, though.

06:36.429 --> 06:39.098
Yeah. She did say that too.

06:39.165 --> 06:43.636
{\an5}So what? Y'all don't
have more experience
in that than me.

06:43.703 --> 06:47.573
{\an5}This is (bleep) that
has fired at everybody.

06:43.703 --> 06:47.573
Yes. I got you.

06:47.640 --> 06:51.410
{\an4}You fire back. You don't sit
there and keep your mouth shut.

06:47.640 --> 06:51.410
And it's worked for you.

06:51.477 --> 06:53.279
{\an5}No, it has not.

06:51.477 --> 06:53.279
Because look at the person
who you are today.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.615
{\an5}It's gotten me blackballed.

06:53.346 --> 06:55.615
No. Look at the person who
you are today.

06:55.681 --> 06:58.818
{\an5}It's made me lose
money. It's made me
lose sponsorships.

06:58.885 --> 07:01.320
What the hell
is Joe talking about?

07:01.387 --> 07:05.057
Joe has made his whole comeback
crapping back at people.

07:05.124 --> 07:09.695
Let's not forget,
Joe's hit podcast took off

07:09.762 --> 07:15.535
{\an5}after he went clapping
back at the Migos. Joe,
you got some damn nerve.

07:15.601 --> 07:18.805
{\an4}Anybody that sells records is
trying to sell more. There's
nothing that you can...

07:18.871 --> 07:21.674
{\an5}I agree!

07:18.871 --> 07:21.674
{\an5}I'm not here
to sugarcoat
y'all's (bleep).

07:21.741 --> 07:27.213
♪♪

07:27.280 --> 07:30.183
{\an8}1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

1, 1, 2, 2, 3,
3, 4, 4, 5...

07:33.052 --> 07:37.089
{\an8}Now that Juelz has taken
a plea deal, everything
is on borrowed time.

07:37.156 --> 07:39.592
{\an8}Honestly,
I'm at my breaking point.

07:39.659 --> 07:42.461
{\an9}Hi!

07:39.659 --> 07:42.461
{\an8}What's up, girl?

07:42.528 --> 07:47.166
{\an9}Girl!

07:42.528 --> 07:47.166
{\an8}Yo, 10, 10, 10, 10, 10.

07:47.233 --> 07:52.038
{\an8}Damn, sister, you
going crazy. You good?

07:47.233 --> 07:52.038
{\an4}Ooh, sis.

07:52.104 --> 07:54.974
{\an5}There's a lot going on.

07:52.104 --> 07:54.974
{\an3}Talk to me.

07:55.041 --> 07:59.879
{\an4}He, um, ended up
taking a plea.

07:55.041 --> 07:59.879
{\an3}Okay.

07:59.946 --> 08:05.885
{\an4}I was there, obviously,
to hold him down and it
turned to (bleep).

08:05.952 --> 08:08.020
What happened?

08:08.087 --> 08:13.593
{\an4}He's not even owning up
to the fact that drugs
had a lot to do with,

08:13.659 --> 08:16.963
{\an1}not alone just this situation
that we have at hand

08:17.029 --> 08:19.866
{\an1}but a lot of things that
have happened in the past.

08:19.932 --> 08:25.571
It's been years of drug abuse,
but then it's like, I'm afraid

08:25.638 --> 08:29.609
that he might even relapse
because he's not owning it.

08:29.675 --> 08:32.678
{\an1}You know how many times
I had to go through withdrawals,

08:32.745 --> 08:36.381
{\an4}me having to take him to
the hospital, him telling me
he's not gonna do it again.

08:36.448 --> 08:40.152
{\an1}Now we in this situation and I
keep saying, I told you so.

08:40.219 --> 08:44.524
{\an4}I understand where you're
coming from. I know you been
there, you held him down,

08:44.590 --> 08:47.260
{\an5}hospital, all that stuff,
but for that one time,
couldn't it have been

08:47.326 --> 08:50.496
{\an4}the only time for you
not to keep it real and
just be like, you know what?

08:50.563 --> 08:54.800
{\an5}He's overwhelmed. He's
gonna leave our family.
Let me just chill.

08:54.867 --> 08:58.070
{\an1}Yes, it wasn't the right time
to have that conversation,

08:58.137 --> 09:02.074
but I felt like I couldn't
hold back from the truth.

09:02.141 --> 09:06.379
Look, I hear you, but at this
moment, with this situation,

09:06.445 --> 09:10.616
you're gonna need everybody's
support, and that's everybody.

09:10.683 --> 09:15.254
I really think right now you
should make peace with Juelz

09:15.321 --> 09:17.823
{\an5}and there's one more
person I think you
should make peace with.

09:17.890 --> 09:22.295
{\an5}Don't even do it.

09:17.890 --> 09:22.295
I feel Yandy is actually going
through a situation right now

09:22.361 --> 09:26.465
{\an5}and if you called her
and you talked to her,
I feel she would be there.

09:26.532 --> 09:31.837
{\an5}To have that conversation
with somebody who can't be
even real with themselves

09:31.904 --> 09:36.509
{\an4}is like walking into some real
bull(bleep). What the (bleep)
are we talking about?

09:38.878 --> 09:42.381
{\an8}Joe always got an
opinion about everybody.

09:42.448 --> 09:45.318
{\an8}I was on the score
page. I see, you know,
the videos and stuff.

I don't do this to you.
I could do it to anybody.

10:13.946 --> 10:18.551
It's your girl Mariahlynn
and I'm back in full effect.

10:18.617 --> 10:23.556
{\an5}This last year, I've decided
to take my turn-up and take it
down a couple of notches

10:23.622 --> 10:29.729
{\an5}and focus on securing the bag.
Looking back, I realize
I was being really bad.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.897
Let me talk.
You let me talk too.

10:31.964 --> 10:33.666
{\an1}You don't get booked,
bitch, you've overlooked.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.568
{\an5}Well, your (bleep)'s
gonna flop from all
the (bleep) you take.

10:35.634 --> 10:38.771
{\an5}No, your mother.

10:35.634 --> 10:38.771
{\an1}All right, don't talk about
my mother the way you...

10:38.838 --> 10:44.844
{\an5}These days, I have no choice
but to take my career
way more seriously

10:44.910 --> 10:49.448
{\an5}because I have a household
full of people depending
on me-- my baby sister,

10:49.515 --> 10:54.053
{\an5}my 20-year-old sister,
my 3-year-old nephew,
and let's be honest,

10:54.120 --> 10:59.825
{\an5}my mom is always gonna
be one of my kids. It's
a lot of pressure to provide.

10:59.892 --> 11:02.495
{\an7}Hi!

10:59.892 --> 11:02.495
{\an9}Hello!

11:02.561 --> 11:05.831
So today, I'm trying
to get a little whoosah

11:05.898 --> 11:09.201
linking up with an old friend
and maybe even a new one.

11:09.268 --> 11:16.809
{\an5}Welcome. Join us.

11:09.268 --> 11:16.809
{\an4}Yes. Y'all look all relaxed
and cozy. I can't wait.
I've been working non-stop.

11:16.876 --> 11:21.714
{\an5}I like Nya. I feel like we
have a lot in common and I can
relate to her being a dancer

11:21.781 --> 11:25.684
{\an5}because everybody knows
I used to shake my little
ass once upon a time.

11:25.751 --> 11:33.025
{\an5}I don't know Cyn that well,
but I'm definitely familiar with
her loud-mouth-ass baby father.

11:33.092 --> 11:35.194
{\an8}What you been working on?

11:35.261 --> 11:39.999
{\an4}I'm dropping a new single
called "Done." I would love
for y'all to come to the party.

11:40.066 --> 11:42.968
{\an5}I'm down.

11:40.066 --> 11:42.968
{\an1}I'm comin'.
I will be there.

11:43.035 --> 11:46.338
{\an5}Are you getting
in the studio?

11:43.035 --> 11:46.338
Are you doing music now?

11:46.405 --> 11:53.045
{\an5}I'm doing music again,
but I have over a year asking
my man to write me a song,

11:53.112 --> 11:56.649
and every time I ask him, he
hits me with the "I'm retired."

11:56.715 --> 11:59.952
{\an5}You know, over the years,
I've dibbed and dabbed
into making music

12:00.019 --> 12:06.592
{\an5}and music really inspires me, so
after talking to Joe, I've been
taking some vocal lessons,

12:06.659 --> 12:10.963
{\an5}but being the girlfriend
of the most opinionated
person in hip-hop culture,

12:11.030 --> 12:13.699
has me a little nervous to show
my talent to the world

12:13.766 --> 12:16.035
because I just
know I'm gonna be judged.

12:16.102 --> 12:19.672
Joe always got an
opinion about everybody.

12:19.738 --> 12:21.540
He's a hard critic.
Yes, he is.

12:21.607 --> 12:25.044
{\an5}I was on the score
page. I see, you know,
the videos and stuff,

12:25.111 --> 12:27.613
{\an5}and I'm like, damn it,
they're not photos,
but I'm like...

12:27.680 --> 12:28.948
(overlapping chatter)

12:29.014 --> 12:30.950
Maybe he's a little
too opinionated.

12:31.016 --> 12:33.486
{\an5}Yeah, you know, I don't
be in people's business
or whatever, but...

12:33.552 --> 12:37.756
{\an5}I don't be in people's
business, but I got
a whole video for you.

12:37.823 --> 12:41.527
{\an5}No, you know...

12:37.823 --> 12:41.527
That's my house.
Oh, my God.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.562
These are my wigs.

12:43.629 --> 12:49.902
{\an5}<i>A couple wigs laying around.</i>
<i>Some baby (bleep)</i>
<i>and some shoes.</i>

12:49.969 --> 12:53.372
<i>I'ma just gonna put all Cyn's</i>
<i>(bleep) in, like, one spot.</i>

12:53.439 --> 12:57.376
{\an5}I don't post videos of
his boxes over here
and the toilet seat up.

12:57.443 --> 12:59.645
{\an5}People probably gonna
think I'm some (bleep)
dirty ass little bitch.

12:59.712 --> 13:03.816
{\an5}I'ma have a talk with him.
I'ma let him know the
kid ain't (bleep) with it.

13:03.883 --> 13:08.654
{\an5}But I see you being real
opinionated on the Gram when
Nicki took shots herself.

13:08.721 --> 13:11.490
{\an5}I mean, when you say,
"look at your roster,"
you're talking about me

13:11.557 --> 13:13.792
and you're belittling
my artistry.

13:13.859 --> 13:16.795
She came for my livelihood,
she came for my team,

13:16.862 --> 13:19.165
and that pissed me all the way
the (bleep) off.

13:19.231 --> 13:23.936
{\an5}Me and Self have had our ups
and downs over the years, but
I would never take away from him

13:24.003 --> 13:27.106
that my career would not be
where it is without him.

13:27.173 --> 13:28.674
Don't come for my
family, don't come...

13:28.741 --> 13:31.343
And Self is considered
to be my family too.

13:31.410 --> 13:33.512
Even though he has his
moments, sis, I will...

13:33.579 --> 13:35.414
{\an1}Ain't in my family.
No, he's not.

13:35.481 --> 13:38.484
I've known DJ Self forever
and every time he sees me,

13:38.551 --> 13:42.188
{\an5}he acts like we best
friends but he don't
show my music no love

13:42.254 --> 13:47.660
{\an5}and I think it's because people
like him and Rich Dollaz have
this misconception about me,

13:47.726 --> 13:51.664
{\an5}like I'm just this pop-off
chick, like I just go everywhere
and just want to fight,

13:51.730 --> 13:54.466
and it's like, that's not who
the (bleep) I am.

13:54.533 --> 13:57.503
{\an5}But what happened with
you and Self, though?
I'm so confused.

13:57.570 --> 14:01.240
{\an5}Every time he sees me,
he's in my face and
is, "Yo, yo, yo, yo."

14:01.307 --> 14:04.410
{\an4}You keep sissing me
and sissing me, but then
there's no support.

14:04.476 --> 14:07.379
I didn't even know there was
smoke between Nya and Self.

14:07.446 --> 14:09.915
I didn't even know they knew
each other like that.

14:09.982 --> 14:13.852
{\an5}Self and I are good now,
but I can definitely see
where Nya's coming from.

14:13.919 --> 14:19.425
{\an5}It killed me when last year,
Self prioritized another
artist over me.

14:19.491 --> 14:22.761
{\an5}I support Gwinin
1,000 million percent.

14:19.491 --> 14:22.761
And Gwinin supports you.

14:22.828 --> 14:25.431
{\an5}No! I don't feel like that.

14:22.828 --> 14:25.431
Yes, absolutely.

14:25.497 --> 14:28.567
{\an5}I feel like I get
the same thing and
with Self, honestly,

14:28.634 --> 14:32.771
{\an5}what I'm told is,
I'm always fighting,
I'm aggressive.

14:32.838 --> 14:38.277
{\an4}In the beginning of my
career, I was angry, but for
me to still not be invited

14:38.344 --> 14:41.614
{\an4}to certain things or
for my talent to continue
to get overlooked,

14:41.680 --> 14:46.652
{\an5}I feel like it's because
of this big misconception
of who Nya Lee really is.

14:46.719 --> 14:49.221
{\an4}I'm in a dog-eat-dog world.
Y'all think I'm gonna be
running around here

14:49.288 --> 14:53.158
{\an4}smiling and I'm busting
my ass to put into
my rap career?

14:53.225 --> 14:57.830
{\an4}I have 36 stitches
going across my neck
from the back of my neck

14:57.896 --> 15:00.132
all the way down to
the top of my chest.

15:00.199 --> 15:06.071
{\an4}I got jumped in a nightclub by
eight random girls I never met
before a day in my life.

15:06.138 --> 15:11.110
{\an1}I felt like... I felt
like, why did I get cut?

15:11.176 --> 15:16.415
{\an4}I got attacked for being me,
and I still feel like I'm
being attacked for being me.

15:16.482 --> 15:18.484
No, you can't let that
change you.

15:18.550 --> 15:21.086
{\an5}I have to tell
myself, I can't keep
beating myself up

15:21.153 --> 15:22.888
for my mother
being a drug addict.

15:22.955 --> 15:25.891
{\an5}I can't keep beating
myself up for my mother
not being a mother,

15:25.958 --> 15:28.193
you know what I'm saying?
My father doing ten years

15:28.260 --> 15:31.597
{\an5}and I have to tell myself
that it's not my fault
that I was in foster care,

15:31.664 --> 15:35.467
{\an5}that I was bounced from
house to house, and now
it gives me a goal to...

15:35.534 --> 15:39.004
{\an1}You gotta just start
sharing the true, honest...

15:39.071 --> 15:44.009
{\an4}You gotta say, yo, I'm hurting,
I'm frustrated, I'm tired of
showing who I really am

30:28.293 --> 30:30.929
Nobody's gonna bother you.
Like, that's not fair.

30:30.995 --> 30:33.097
{\an8}♪♪

30:33.164 --> 30:35.033
{\an8}Let's address the
elephant in the room.

30:35.099 --> 30:38.169
{\an7}The elephant can address
the room herself.

30:35.099 --> 30:38.169
{\an5}Okay, well, address it.

30:38.236 --> 30:39.370
{\an8}So, but I didn't
need permission.

30:39.437 --> 30:41.272
{\an8}♪♪

30:46.277 --> 30:49.814
{\an8}♪♪

30:59.257 --> 31:01.492
{\an9}Cheers!

31:01.559 --> 31:04.128
{\an8}(speaking Spanish)

31:01.559 --> 31:04.128
{\an9}Thank you.

31:04.195 --> 31:06.331
{\an1}You're like this beautiful
just, like, goddess.

31:06.397 --> 31:12.737
{\an8}After all the drama with
Jonathan, Anais, Kimbella, and
myself, I was very surprised

31:12.804 --> 31:17.909
{\an8}to get a message from Jonathan
saying, "Meet up today," and it
had no explanation,

31:17.976 --> 31:23.248
{\an5}and after Cyn got the same
text message, I was too
curious not to show up.

31:23.314 --> 31:27.218
{\an5}Jonathan and I have not
spoken since I walked out
on our last meeting,

31:27.285 --> 31:30.922
and I really hope that he's
in a better mind frame today.

31:30.989 --> 31:34.392
{\an8}Hi, beauties.

31:30.989 --> 31:34.392
{\an9}Hello!

31:34.459 --> 31:38.129
{\an4}Babe!

31:34.459 --> 31:38.129
How are you?
How you doing?

31:38.196 --> 31:41.132
{\an5}Hiya, Pooka.

31:38.196 --> 31:41.132
Hi! How are you?

31:41.199 --> 31:42.834
{\an5}Good. How are you?

31:41.199 --> 31:42.834
Good to see you.

31:42.900 --> 31:46.437
{\an5}Where is Jonathan?

31:42.900 --> 31:46.437
Here's the girl of the hour.

31:46.504 --> 31:48.239
Aah! Oh, my God,
that's not Joey.

31:48.306 --> 31:51.142
{\an4}Don't ever
touch my ass again.

31:48.306 --> 31:51.142
{\an3}Sugar!

31:51.209 --> 31:53.111
I just (bleep) got you!

31:53.177 --> 31:56.881
{\an8}After talking to my
sister Jas, I've decided to
come clean with my friends

31:56.948 --> 32:00.918
{\an8}or at least the friends that I
think are worth salvaging.

32:00.985 --> 32:03.855
Losing my dad took a huge toll
on me, so I definitely

32:03.921 --> 32:06.524
{\an5}don't want to lose
any more people in my life
that I care for.

32:06.591 --> 32:07.792
I thought this
was personal time.

32:07.859 --> 32:09.193
You texted me you
wanted to talk to me.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.395
I didn't know I was gonna
see these two heifers.

32:10.461 --> 32:11.896
(laughter)

32:11.963 --> 32:13.931
(overlapping chatter)

32:13.998 --> 32:15.967
I'm just so happy to
see the three of you.

32:16.034 --> 32:18.770
{\an1}There's more people coming, so,
you know, let's just wait,

32:18.836 --> 32:20.305
{\an1}'cause I feel like I want to
talk to you girls about,

32:20.371 --> 32:22.240
{\an1}like, a lot of stuff.
I kind of have a lot of stuff.

32:22.307 --> 32:24.042
{\an5}Who's coming?

32:22.307 --> 32:24.042
Who's the other girl?

32:24.108 --> 32:27.812
I invited Kimbella.

32:27.879 --> 32:30.081
I didn't invite Anais today
because I'm not sure

32:30.148 --> 32:32.817
she's 100% ready to hear
what I have to say.

32:32.884 --> 32:34.552
I don't want another
huge scene with everybody,

32:34.619 --> 32:37.955
so I felt it best at this time
to just keep Anais out of it.

32:38.022 --> 32:41.292
{\an1}I know that there's issues
amongst the group and everything

32:41.359 --> 32:44.529
{\an1}and while I think it takes two
to tango, I've come here

32:44.595 --> 32:47.198
{\an1}to at least acknowledge
what I've done wrong,

32:47.265 --> 32:52.537
{\an5}why I've reacted the way
that I've reacted, and what I
have to tell you guys is,

32:52.603 --> 32:59.277
{\an4}for maybe eight years
now, I've been taking
anxiety medication.

32:59.344 --> 33:04.115
{\an4}I'm not supposed to be mixing
them with alcohol, and that's
the bigger problem.

33:04.182 --> 33:07.885
{\an1}When things escalate,
I turn into this freak show

33:07.952 --> 33:10.955
that the next day I wake up
and I'm like, what happened?

33:11.022 --> 33:14.292
{\an1}Even sometimes talking
with you guys after the fact,

33:14.359 --> 33:17.362
{\an4}I'm like, I could not have
said that. I did that?

33:14.359 --> 33:17.362
{\an3}Mm-hmm.

33:17.428 --> 33:20.131
{\an4}That's why I knew
I had to stop.

33:17.428 --> 33:20.131
First of all, I'd
like to commend you

33:20.198 --> 33:24.635
{\an4}for even sharing with us
and admitting that you mixing
the pills with alcohol

33:24.702 --> 33:27.638
{\an4}is what caused this to be
bigger than what it should
have been from the beginning.

33:27.705 --> 33:31.642
{\an5}Since we're talking
about it, what is the
real issue with me?

33:31.709 --> 33:35.546
{\an1}I was hurt. When I was on
the pills and talking about it,

33:35.613 --> 33:37.982
{\an1}then it became a big thing,
you know what I'm saying?

33:38.049 --> 33:41.085
And for that, I apologize
because you're my friend.

33:41.152 --> 33:43.988
{\an5}Like I said, Jonathan,
I never wanted to
hurt you in any way.

33:44.055 --> 33:46.491
{\an5}After all this happened,
I said, you know what?
To hell with that podcast.

33:46.557 --> 33:48.059
{\an1}Let me keep on with the
things that I have going on.

33:48.126 --> 33:50.428
I don't even want to see a
podcast, okay? I'm over it.

33:50.495 --> 33:52.597
It's not just the podcast
situation, you know what I mean?

33:52.663 --> 33:54.999
{\an1}Bygones are bygones.
I miss my friend.

33:55.066 --> 33:58.636
{\an5}I love you to pieces.
I don't walk away from
friendships like that.

33:58.703 --> 34:00.505
{\an7}Hi!

33:58.703 --> 34:00.505
{\an9}Hi!

34:00.571 --> 34:02.473
Ooh!

34:00.571 --> 34:02.473
{\an1}Hey, baby!

34:02.540 --> 34:06.310
Even though Mendeecees wants me
and Kim to be cool,

34:06.377 --> 34:10.547
{\an5}which may happen in
our own time, I'm not
ready for that today.

34:10.614 --> 34:12.650
Thank you for coming,
"Kimbrellie."

34:12.717 --> 34:16.788
{\an4}You texted me. I'm here.
I didn't expect no
ladies to be here.

34:16.853 --> 34:19.190
{\an6}Well...

34:16.853 --> 34:19.190
{\an1}It's not about to be another
(bleep) show, right? 'Cause...

34:19.257 --> 34:23.161
{\an5}No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

34:19.257 --> 34:23.161
{\an1}I got so much (bleep) going on
right now, I can't even...

34:23.226 --> 34:24.529
{\an5}I've heard.

34:23.226 --> 34:24.529
{\an1}...deal.

34:24.594 --> 34:25.963
{\an5}I've heard this.

34:24.594 --> 34:25.963
You've heard.

34:26.030 --> 34:28.299
I know that the last time
that we all hung out,

34:28.366 --> 34:31.803
{\an4}it was a (bleep) show and I'm
gonna at least take ownership
for what I did wrong.

34:31.869 --> 34:34.237
{\an5}I am. I'm gonna take
ownership for what I
did wrong, Kimba,

34:34.304 --> 34:39.143
'cause I didn't handle you
with a clear mind.

34:39.210 --> 34:41.779
{\an5}I know you're probably
going through hell and I
don't want to add to that.

34:41.846 --> 34:45.683
{\an5}I swear to God,
that's genuinely how
I feel, Kim, for real.

34:45.750 --> 34:48.652
{\an5}Do you take my apology?

34:45.750 --> 34:48.652
{\an1}I mean, here's
the only thing with that.

34:48.719 --> 34:52.089
{\an1}It wasn't just everything
that was going on that night.

34:52.156 --> 34:56.327
{\an1}You made it seem like I was
doing something to my friend,

34:56.393 --> 34:59.831
{\an5}talking about my friend
that I would not...
I would never do that.

34:59.897 --> 35:02.400
All that extra (bleep)
don't need to go down.

35:02.467 --> 35:05.169
{\an1}You're a beautiful person.
You're very talented.

35:05.236 --> 35:06.804
{\an1}So, let's just--
let's stick to that.

35:06.871 --> 35:11.676
{\an4}Let's stick to just being
friends, being there
for one another and,

35:11.742 --> 35:14.912
{\an4}you know, (bleep) all the
other bull(bleep). There are
so many other things going on.

35:14.979 --> 35:19.283
{\an5}Well, since we're on the topic
of everybody being friends and
supporting each other,

35:19.350 --> 35:21.385
let's address
the elephant in the room.

35:21.452 --> 35:22.854
(overlapping chatter)

35:22.920 --> 35:24.622
Can I finish speaking?

35:24.689 --> 35:27.391
{\an5}No, because I don't
need you to address the
elephant in the room.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.394
{\an4}The elephant can address
the room herself.

35:27.458 --> 35:30.394
Okay, well, address it.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.763
So, but I didn't
need permission.

35:32.830 --> 35:35.299
{\an1}What is happening right now?
Why was I interrupted?

35:35.366 --> 35:37.602
(overlapping chatter)

35:37.668 --> 35:39.403
{\an5}Kim, can I talk to you
off to the side? I don't
want to do this...

35:39.470 --> 35:44.542
{\an5}Oh, you want to talk to me?

35:39.470 --> 35:44.542
I don't want to do
this whole big moment.

35:44.609 --> 35:47.678
♪♪

35:47.745 --> 35:48.980
{\an8}Go ahead and say
what you gotta say.

35:49.046 --> 35:50.147
{\an7}I'm gonna say what I
have to say

35:50.214 --> 35:51.349
{\an7}and you
gonna listen this time.

35:51.415 --> 35:53.150
{\an8}I've been listening,
so don't talk to me

35:53.217 --> 35:55.286
{\an8}like I'm a (bleep) child.
That's gonna be an issue.

35:55.353 --> 35:57.221
{\an8}♪♪

36:00.858 --> 36:03.761
{\an8}♪♪

36:03.828 --> 36:06.130
{\an8}Kim, can I talk to you
off to the side? I don't
want to do this...

36:06.197 --> 36:08.266
{\an1}Oh, you want to talk to me?
Oh, God!

36:08.332 --> 36:10.735
{\an8}Go speak to her.
That's great.

36:10.801 --> 36:16.007
{\an1}So, listen, there is a bunch
that we could talk about.

36:16.073 --> 36:18.175
{\an8}If you feel like you want to
get something off your chest,

36:18.242 --> 36:20.278
{\an7}if you feel like you
want to discuss something...

36:20.344 --> 36:22.580
I've done that.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.580
{\an1}Great.

36:22.647 --> 36:25.449
{\an5}My whole thing is,
I didn't even know you
were gonna be here today.

36:25.516 --> 36:29.353
{\an8}We've already spoken.
I said, until you own it,

36:29.420 --> 36:31.622
{\an8}we have nothing else to
talk about, so if you're
not ready for that,

36:31.689 --> 36:33.090
{\an8}we have nothing to
talk about right now.

36:33.157 --> 36:34.325
{\an7}But, Kim, listen, I'm not gonna
own something that's untrue.

36:34.392 --> 36:36.661
You listen, you listen.

36:36.727 --> 36:42.266
{\an5}I don't want to hear no more
about baby mamas, nothing.
That's not the issue.

36:42.333 --> 36:47.939
{\an5}Months later, Kim and Juelz
were in a horrible space.
They were actually broken up.

36:48.005 --> 36:52.376
{\an5}I was sick and tired of
always ending up in
the middle of their beefs.

36:52.443 --> 36:56.013
{\an5}That's my friend and
you're my friend. You guys
are more like family.

36:56.080 --> 37:01.319
{\an5}It got to a point where I needed
a break, so did I leave her when
she needed me? Probably.

37:01.385 --> 37:06.958
{\an5}Probably because I was one of
her only friends caught up in
the middle of their nonsense.

37:07.024 --> 37:10.728
Nothing else you're saying is
true, so please cut the (bleep).

37:10.795 --> 37:15.766
{\an4}We're gonna have two civilized
conversations from women that
have been through hell and back.

37:15.833 --> 37:17.802
{\an1}Okay, so, go ahead
and say what you gotta say.

37:17.868 --> 37:20.171
{\an4}I'm gonna say what
I have to say and you
gonna listen this time.

37:20.237 --> 37:21.973
I've been listening,
so don't talk to me

37:22.039 --> 37:24.041
like I'm a (bleep) child.
That's gonna be an issue.

37:24.108 --> 37:25.343
{\an5}Lower your voice.

37:24.108 --> 37:25.343
I'm not gonna
lower my voice.

37:25.409 --> 37:27.378
{\an1}Don't put your hands
in my face.

37:27.445 --> 37:31.449
{\an4}This is what happened
on my birthday. This is
what happened on my birthday.

37:31.515 --> 37:34.318
{\an1}I don't talk to you like this.
I don't do this to you.

37:34.385 --> 37:38.155
{\an4}I could do it to anybody.
I don't do that.

37:34.385 --> 37:38.155
So, do it, then!

37:38.222 --> 37:39.757
{\an4}This is not
what you want.

37:38.222 --> 37:39.757
All right, listen.

37:39.824 --> 37:41.158
And you don't, neither,
so what happened?

37:41.225 --> 37:42.994
{\an1}You want a hug,
that's what you want.

37:43.060 --> 37:45.663
{\an1}You want a (bleep) hug
more than me, more than me,

37:45.730 --> 37:48.399
{\an5}'cause you been dealing
with this (bleep) longer
than I have.

37:45.730 --> 37:48.399
{\an1}I have!

37:48.466 --> 37:51.636
Kim, I'm trying to be here
for you. That's it.

37:51.702 --> 37:57.341
{\an5}Your man is about leave,
leave you alone to raise
children by yourself.

37:57.408 --> 38:00.911
Just let it go.
Let go of the past.

38:00.978 --> 38:04.982
{\an4}This is not a situation
that I want you to deal
with by yourself,

38:05.049 --> 38:07.885
{\an4}because when I needed
that shoulder, when I
needed a floor to sleep on,

38:07.952 --> 38:11.088
{\an4}it was yours that was
provided for me, so for
that reason alone,

38:11.155 --> 38:14.325
{\an1}I'm gonna respect you enough
to do the same for you.

38:14.392 --> 38:15.660
It's too late,
it's too late.

38:15.726 --> 38:17.461
{\an6}No.

38:15.726 --> 38:17.461
It's not too late.

38:17.528 --> 38:21.032
{\an4}It's never too late for
a real friend to come to
defend and be there for you.

38:21.098 --> 38:26.437
{\an5}I'm never gonna allow
you to feel like, yo,
I'ma be there for my girl,

38:26.504 --> 38:29.006
{\an5}but then, at the end
of the day, I'm doing
something amazing.

38:29.073 --> 38:32.443
{\an5}I'ma post it on Instagram
and it's gonna be
a great look for me,

38:32.510 --> 38:33.944
'cause that's
how you ride out.

38:34.011 --> 38:38.082
Yandy loves to pretend like
she's this amazing friend

38:38.149 --> 38:40.985
that's gonna be there for you
when you need her,

38:41.052 --> 38:44.422
{\an5}when really all she does
is post on social media
to make it seem like,

38:44.488 --> 38:46.557
oh, Yandy,
oh, she's so wonderful.

38:46.624 --> 38:49.894
Well, I'm here to tell you
that Yandy ain't so wonderful.

38:49.960 --> 38:53.464
I'm not gonna let her use me
and Juelz in this situation

38:53.531 --> 38:55.232
so she can post
on social media

38:55.299 --> 38:59.170
{\an5}so she can make y'all
feel like, oh, look,
I'm there for them. No!

38:59.236 --> 39:02.540
{\an1}Okay. All right. I don't
see what is going on

39:02.606 --> 39:05.576
{\an1}with this petty (bleep).
You have the olive branch.

39:05.643 --> 39:09.313
{\an5}Yandy, there's nothing
petty. I don't want
a (bleep) olive branch.

39:09.380 --> 39:11.716
{\an5}If you want to be
my friend, I want
the whole (bleep) tree

39:11.782 --> 39:14.185
{\an5}and until you (bleep)
own the (bleep) that I've
(bleep) said to you

39:14.251 --> 39:17.855
{\an4}and until you
acknowledge the type of
friend I need, we are good.

39:17.922 --> 39:19.924
We don't need to be
nothin'. That's it.

39:19.990 --> 39:22.493
I only have an olive branch.

39:22.560 --> 39:26.163
{\an4}I'm going home. I'm tired.
I have to get back to
these babies.

39:26.230 --> 39:28.432
{\an1}Y'all need me, I'm here.
Love you.

39:28.499 --> 39:31.435

{\an8}(Joe)
Next time on "Love &amp; Hip Hop"...

39:41.579 --> 39:42.747
{\an7}It's getting closer
to the time

39:42.813 --> 39:45.116
{\an7}that I have to go in
and I know it's gonna be

39:45.182 --> 39:48.352
{\an7}even harder for the
both of us and our family
at the same time.

39:48.419 --> 39:49.787
{\an9}Oh, my God!

39:49.854 --> 39:51.789
{\an8}(kids squealing)

39:51.856 --> 39:56.460
{\an8}Can't you ask 'em to,
like, not take you away?

39:56.527 --> 39:59.130
{\an8}I've tried and I'm
gonna keep trying.

40:01.198 --> 40:05.803
{\an7}Do you think hip hop is ready
for a transgender artist?

40:05.870 --> 40:08.339
{\an7}You gotta find your core fan
base and the people

40:08.405 --> 40:11.041
{\an7}that you inspire and
that's who you doing it for.

40:11.108 --> 40:13.711
{\an8}You hit me up plenty
of times on the Gram,

40:13.778 --> 40:16.781
{\an7}over three years, you
come in, you give me this?

40:16.847 --> 40:20.151
{\an8}I want this so bad.

40:16.847 --> 40:20.151
{\an7}You don't want it!
Not that!

40:20.217 --> 40:24.155
{\an8}You are neglecting me
and you are neglecting
your relationship.

40:24.221 --> 40:27.424
{\an8}I want someone who's gonna
listen to me and make me
feel like I'm important.

40:27.491 --> 40:28.692
{\an8}You don't make me
feel like that.

40:28.759 --> 40:30.461
{\an8}I've been depressed
for a few months now

40:30.528 --> 40:33.697
{\an8}and you can't even see
that because all you
do is (bleep) work!

40:33.764 --> 40:39.904
{\an7}Unfortunately, my work
is 25/8. I'm fine if
we have to break up.

40:39.970 --> 40:43.574
{\an8}You have to expect certain
changes during pregnancy.

40:43.641 --> 40:47.077
{\an7}I don't think that that
gives somebody a right to
just treat somebody like that.

40:47.144 --> 40:50.080
{\an8}♪♪
