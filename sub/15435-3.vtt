Previously  on "Brothers & Sisters"...

00:02.140 --> 00:04.470
when that nerve block wears
off,it's gonna hurt like hell.

00:04.600 --> 00:06.010
Aren't you gonna prescribe something?

00:06.120 --> 00:08.740
Given justin's history of drug addition,

00:08.740 --> 00:11.120
he is completely against
taking any narcotics.

00:11.220 --> 00:12.530
my wife cheated on me.

00:12.640 --> 00:15.410
She accused me of cheating on her so she
could get a better divorce settlement,

00:15.410 --> 00:16.490
and she knows I won't fight it.

00:16.610 --> 00:21.510
William,our son,should be here with
his sister,with us,and he's not.

00:21.640 --> 00:23.480
- Look,I know he's gone.
- I know it hurts.I'm sorry.

00:24.670 --> 00:26.960
Now you know how hard it is to love
someone who doesn't love himself.

00:27.090 --> 00:28.880
You know,you ended
things with me,scotty.

00:28.990 --> 00:31.210
I think my mom needs
someone at the vineyard.

00:31.330 --> 00:32.619
That would be so awesome.

00:32.740 --> 00:34.990
Sweetheart,you have to take something.

00:35.090 --> 00:36.460
I can'T.

00:37.100 --> 00:39.470
Hold on.Just hold on.

00:42.660 --> 00:44.900
okay.okay,good.

00:45.010 --> 00:47.940
- I got you.
- I got you.

00:48.510 --> 00:51.020
- good,good,good.
- Okay.

00:51.140 --> 00:53.460
- What is this,a bubble bath?
- Yeah.Don't knock it till you've tried it.

00:53.580 --> 00:56.330
- Look,we'll get those bars installed.
- Yeah.

00:56.340 --> 00:58.260
All right?

01:00.830 --> 01:03.070
ooh.

01:06.270 --> 01:09.540
- are you okay?
- Yeah,I'm great.

01:10.070 --> 01:13.230
Oh,don't give me that gentle kevin
look.You know it creeps me out.

01:13.340 --> 01:15.860
Okay,well,stop... stop being so macho.

01:15.990 --> 01:17.590
What are you gonna do,light candles now?

01:17.710 --> 01:19.400
Yes,as a matter of fact.

01:19.520 --> 01:21.010
Look,I'm creating a
meditative atmosphere.

01:21.130 --> 01:24.170
It's a well-known fact
meditation can help minimize pain.

01:24.300 --> 01:27.240
The only thing you're minimizing
right now is my testosterone level.

01:27.360 --> 01:30.040
Check this out.

01:30.370 --> 01:31.950
oh,no.No,no,no,no.

01:32.070 --> 01:33.610
- It's peaceful.
- It's crap.

01:33.730 --> 01:36.380
Will you just get a cd
off my dresser,please?

01:36.480 --> 01:37.750
Okay,fine.

01:37.850 --> 01:40.340
But you're ruining my vibe.

01:44.780 --> 01:46.730
kevin,I said turn it off!

01:46.970 --> 01:49.930
- What?Okay,okay! -
Oh,no.I-I didn't see anything.

01:49.970 --> 01:53.020
- Ooh.Okay.
- Um...are those bubbles?

01:53.670 --> 01:55.080
No.

01:55.190 --> 01:56.490
Okay,you have a ch... oh,wow.

01:56.590 --> 01:58.970
- Hi.
- Um,may I please grab my toothbrush?

01:59.080 --> 02:01.050
Yeah,sure.Okay.

02:01.170 --> 02:03.870
We grew up with sisters.We gave
up on privacy a long time ago.

02:03.960 --> 02:06.160
You know what?Speak for yourself.

02:07.620 --> 02:09.729
- you want me to stay with you?
- Kevin,I'm not dying.

02:09.850 --> 02:12.670
- You don't need to keep a vigil for me.
- Okay,fine.

02:15.400 --> 02:17.890
Back in a bit.

02:25.010 --> 02:28.440
- how did it go?
- He'd be a model patient if he weren't so ornery.

02:28.880 --> 02:31.240
Is he really not taking any medication?

02:31.350 --> 02:33.660
- Aspirin,ibuprofen.
- That's not enough.

02:33.790 --> 02:34.820
No.

02:34.930 --> 02:38.070
The doctors told him yesterday
point-blank,by not taking the painkillers,

02:38.190 --> 02:39.630
he's interfering with his own recovery.

02:39.740 --> 02:42.490
He not sleeping.He's not
resting.He's just not getting better.

02:42.740 --> 02:44.480
Just because you're staying
with your daddy,paige,

02:44.600 --> 02:47.060
doesn't mean you can
use that tone with me.

02:47.180 --> 02:49.840
Well,I am sorry that you think that.

02:49.970 --> 02:53.040
I still love you.Okay?Bye-bye,chicken.

02:53.370 --> 02:56.790
Yeah,I got mother of
the year all sewn up.

02:57.390 --> 02:59.510
- Where's justin?
- Taking a bath.

02:59.630 --> 03:00.990
Is he still in pain?

03:01.110 --> 03:02.230
- Yes.
- Bad.

03:02.340 --> 03:04.540
He's still not taking his meds.

03:04.650 --> 03:06.140
He's afraid.

03:06.240 --> 03:07.660
He wants to stay sober.

03:07.780 --> 03:10.140
Yeah,but if by not taking
them he's stalling rehab,

03:10.250 --> 03:12.960
or worse,risking more injury...

03:13.100 --> 03:15.170
he could have trouble walking,running...

03:15.280 --> 03:17.080
mm,surfing.Did you try surfing?

03:17.200 --> 03:20.010
Yes,I offered to buy
him a new surfboard.

03:20.010 --> 03:23.260
What,am I crazy?I'm terrified
'll become an addict again.

03:23.380 --> 03:25.200
I know what he went
through,what we all went through.

03:25.310 --> 03:26.270
You're not crazy,mom.

03:26.390 --> 03:29.140
Every time I talk to him,it's
like talking to a stone wall.

03:29.260 --> 03:31.680
Well,I think we should keep trying.

03:32.740 --> 03:34.670
how do you manage to smell so good,

03:34.790 --> 03:36.950
even in the basement
of a chemical plant?

03:37.060 --> 03:39.750
God,is there some sort of
presidential aftershave you're wearing?

03:39.880 --> 03:42.500
You smell like a power devil.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.130
- A power devil?
- yeah.

03:44.230 --> 03:47.390
Is that like a tasmanian devil?'Cause
I think I shot one of those once.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.160
Okay,uh,listen.Hey.

03:50.260 --> 03:53.540
Six minutes ago I learned that your
ex-wife courtney is going on "larry king,"

03:53.670 --> 03:57.360
where she will be nastily telegenic
while also sympathetic and vulnerable.

03:57.460 --> 03:59.230
Look,people are sick of that stuff.

03:59.370 --> 04:01.970
They want to talk about
health care,jobs,the war,

04:02.090 --> 04:05.940
why it's 72 degrees in iowa
in the middle of october.Right?

04:06.300 --> 04:07.920
What?Why...why are you
giving me that face?

04:08.040 --> 04:10.010
Well,because travis has a point.

04:10.130 --> 04:14.320
They also want to make sure that you didn't throw
your wife under a bus in a mad dash to power.

04:14.460 --> 04:18.370
- You...you're definitely gonna have to talk to her.
- Thank you.Finally.

04:18.510 --> 04:21.130
So you think that I should
crawl into the gutter with her.

04:21.250 --> 04:24.080
No.No,I don't think
you're gonna have to crawl.

04:24.450 --> 04:26.290
I...I think she'll drag you there.

04:27.370 --> 04:29.490
Enough.I have voters to meet with.

04:29.720 --> 04:32.000
He so listens to you.I'm awed.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.750
- He has to make up his own mind.
- Yes,but you can help him with that.

04:34.870 --> 04:38.030
we have to muzzle
her,kitty.Would you talk to him?

04:38.150 --> 04:41.180
As his smiling fiancee or
his communications director?

04:41.300 --> 04:43.600
Either,but pick one.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.950
I'll go along with whichever you decide.

04:51.100 --> 04:54.100
so you're gonna love this accounting
program.And as the business grows,

04:54.250 --> 04:57.660
you can expand the functionality
to handle online orders.

04:57.770 --> 05:00.600
- We should be so lucky.
- We'll get there.

05:00.640 --> 05:02.500
- You'll see.
- Sorry to interrupt.

05:02.610 --> 05:05.210
Nonfat chai latte for holly.

05:05.330 --> 05:07.280
Tommy gets the tall americano.

05:07.400 --> 05:08.980
And,saul,I got you a double espresso.

05:09.100 --> 05:11.800
Oh,tommy,I put your schedule up
online so you can access it from home.

05:12.090 --> 05:14.770
- Thanks.
- one of these days we're gonna clone you.

05:14.880 --> 05:18.020
Cool.So with two of me,that
means my salary doubles,right?

05:18.130 --> 05:19.900
Uh,no.

05:20.020 --> 05:21.980
All right,move over.Let
me give this a shot.

05:22.110 --> 05:23.250
Okay.

05:23.390 --> 05:25.390
- Lina seems to be working out,huh?
- Yeah.

05:25.510 --> 05:27.240
Yeah,she's been great.

05:27.350 --> 05:29.550
Are these the latest pictures of lizzie?

05:29.760 --> 05:33.030
She's really starting to look like a
walker more and more every day,isn't she?

05:33.140 --> 05:34.590
Yeah.

05:35.410 --> 05:37.420
So tell me,tommy...

05:37.550 --> 05:39.730
how's julia?

05:41.590 --> 05:45.630
Honestly,I can't remember the last
time she seemed completely happy.

05:46.080 --> 05:48.170
Well,you ow,you have to give her time.

05:48.410 --> 05:50.300
The two of you have been through a lot.

05:50.970 --> 05:53.120
And just out of curiosity,

05:53.230 --> 05:56.520
what was a time that the two
of you were completely happy?

05:59.090 --> 06:01.280
Our honeymoon.

06:01.840 --> 06:04.550
But I can't justick up and go to hawaii.

06:05.990 --> 06:08.460
Well,then you bring hawaii to her.

06:10.280 --> 06:12.530
oh,come on.Come on,lizzie.

06:12.530 --> 06:13.870
- Can you smile?
- honey?

06:13.990 --> 06:16.300
Hey,babe?

06:16.840 --> 06:20.410
oh,hey,uh,ben,beth.What A...

06:20.790 --> 06:22.260
what a nice surprise.

06:22.290 --> 06:24.610
well,you keep working
on that poker face,son.

06:24.730 --> 06:27.580
No,it's just,uh,I didn't
know you were coming.

06:27.700 --> 06:31.050
Well,I just couldn't spend
another second away from my girls.

06:31.160 --> 06:33.960
I swear I could eat this child up.

06:34.070 --> 06:35.160
yeah.

06:35.170 --> 06:38.110
- What are you doin' home?
- I,uh,took the afternoon off.

06:38.230 --> 06:41.190
- I...
- oh,look,jules,he brought you an orchid.

06:41.310 --> 06:43.310
Yeah,I was thinking about
that week in maui and

06:43.320 --> 06:46.390
how you wore an orchid in your
hair every day,and I... oh.

06:46.390 --> 06:47.650
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

06:47.770 --> 06:50.980
What did you do?A man only
brings home flowers to apologize.

06:50.990 --> 06:52.210
stop it,ben.

06:52.340 --> 06:55.600
Don't mind him,tommy.He's
just cranky from the drive.

06:55.670 --> 06:57.180
it's beautif.

06:57.280 --> 06:59.970
I love it.Thank you.

07:03.620 --> 07:06.010
So your parents just showed up?

07:06.100 --> 07:08.260
We don't always know when
your family is stopping by.

07:08.370 --> 07:11.440
Yeah,but at the end of the
night,my family goes home.

07:11.580 --> 07:14.430
How long are your folks staying for?

07:14.720 --> 07:17.040
As long as they want.

07:20.080 --> 07:22.560
I brought you a ginger ale.

07:22.870 --> 07:25.450
Thanks.

07:25.660 --> 07:27.400
Mom,I'm okay.I'm fine.

07:27.520 --> 07:30.450
Oh,yeah,you're fine.You're
terrific.We should all be so lucky.

07:30.550 --> 07:33.000
All right,tell me,what's the
fastest way out of this conversation?

07:33.100 --> 07:36.330
- By having it.
- Okay,I'm not "fine."

07:36.460 --> 07:39.140
No,you're not fine.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.540
I think we...

07:42.810 --> 07:46.550
you should explore the possibility
of taking the pain medication.

07:46.670 --> 07:48.490
You realize you're
talking to your son justin?

07:48.610 --> 07:50.300
The youngest one,the one
with the drug problem?

07:50.410 --> 07:53.070
I've talked to all of your doctors
and your physical therapist.

07:53.180 --> 07:54.880
I even called dr.Benedict.

07:55.000 --> 07:58.670
My pediatrician?Mom,you know
what?I'm not 12 years old,okay?

07:58.800 --> 07:59.980
This isn't strep throat.

08:00.090 --> 08:02.640
He's one of the most
respected doctors in this town.

08:02.750 --> 08:04.960
They all agree that if
we keep the dosage low,

08:05.080 --> 08:07.620
- if we monitor...
- mom,I don't care what they think!

08:07.730 --> 08:10.370
Okay,did you call the rehab where I
sobered up?Did you call my sponsor?

08:10.490 --> 08:12.160
When you got sober,I
was there every day,.

08:12.280 --> 08:14.600
and I worried about you
every minute that I wasn'T

08:14.700 --> 08:17.540
Do you think I want to be
standing here advocating you

08:17.660 --> 08:20.390
- using drugs again for any reason?
- Then why are you doing it,mom?

08:20.510 --> 08:22.860
Because I'm old enough to know
that when life does something

08:22.980 --> 08:26.030
this horrible to you,there are
no rules as to how to get over it.

08:26.140 --> 08:29.500
You just have to do whatever you
can,anything you can,to make it better.

08:29.610 --> 08:34.270
Ma,I can't,okay?"Anything"
is not an option for me.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.460
Can we at least discuss this?

08:52.580 --> 08:54.160
Would you please stop walking so fast?

08:54.280 --> 08:56.060
- I got a plane to catch.
- Honey,it's your plane.

08:56.080 --> 08:57.460
They're not gonna be
leaving without you.

08:57.580 --> 09:01.580
I am not gonna beg my ex-wife not to
discuss an affair that I never had.

09:01.710 --> 09:03.560
Okay,fine,fine.Don't beg.

09:03.680 --> 09:05.770
Just...just draw that line in the sand.

09:05.880 --> 09:09.840
Do you have any idea how much the
electorate loathes politicians right now?

09:09.950 --> 09:13.630
It has been crooks,liars and
hypocrites since the salem witch trials.

09:13.750 --> 09:15.510
I'm not gettin' down in the
muck while insisting that faith

09:15.660 --> 09:17.610
and honor be restored
to american politics.

09:17.720 --> 09:20.360
You're not gonna survive a sex scandal.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.140
And the voters don't even know you yet.

09:22.280 --> 09:24.420
There's...there's not gonna
be any insisting on anything

09:24.550 --> 09:27.100
because you're gonna end
up a joke on late night.

09:28.650 --> 09:30.620
And is this the opinion
of a politico or a girl

09:30.750 --> 09:33.390
who's pissed 'cause her
guy's getting slandered?

09:33.510 --> 09:35.500
if you want to bring faith
back to politics,robert,

09:35.620 --> 09:37.600
you're gonna have to
fight for your name.

09:37.730 --> 09:41.160
If an uncomfortable conversation
with your ex is too much to ask,

09:41.310 --> 09:44.610
well,then,yeah,the politico in
me and the girl has to wonder

09:44.720 --> 09:47.670
how much faith you have in yourself.

09:48.670 --> 09:52.780
- I hate this.
- Yeah.Yeah,me,too.

09:54.520 --> 09:57.140
Talk to her.

10:01.880 --> 10:04.250
kevin,your 4:00 with
mr.Balanchine is here.

10:04.350 --> 10:06.870
Send him waltzing on in,lisa.

10:14.150 --> 10:16.440
Wow.Scotty

10:17.450 --> 10:19.980
- Uh,wh-why the
subterfuge? - I'm sorry.

10:20.090 --> 10:22.410
I didn't think you'd take
the meeting given how...

10:22.510 --> 10:24.620
weird things were last time we met.

10:25.700 --> 10:27.600
you know,I'm... look,I'm sorry.

10:27.710 --> 10:31.210
I sh... I should never have...

10:31.350 --> 10:34.730
slept with you that...that
night.It was... it was really wrong.

10:34.860 --> 10:37.540
Well,it's not like you drugged me.

10:38.330 --> 10:41.530
- You look good.
- Thank you.I'm...I'm okay.

10:41.650 --> 10:43.780
It's nice to see you.

10:43.880 --> 10:47.310
- So is everything okay?
- No,kevin.

10:48.000 --> 10:52.630
I need a lawyer,preferably one who
might be flexible about payment.

10:52.730 --> 10:55.530
Okay,what happened?Did you get nabbed
shoplifting mascara and a thong?

10:55.650 --> 10:58.910
I got a D.U.I.I had a glass of pinot
gris,but it's impossible I was drunk.

10:59.030 --> 11:01.250
Did they do a breathalyzer?What
was your blood alcohol?

11:01.260 --> 11:03.330
08,barely anything.

11:03.460 --> 11:05.930
Right over the legal
limit.Kevin,this cop was weird.

11:06.050 --> 11:08.080
He took one look at me,and
he was totally homophobic.

11:08.200 --> 11:11.610
I was wearing pink shorts
and an old queen t-shirt,

11:11.610 --> 11:14.380
and he smirked and put on
gloves when he took my license.

11:14.490 --> 11:17.240
And then...and then he made this
face like I had some disease.

11:17.350 --> 11:20.150
Did he?Do you have the notice to appear?

11:26.820 --> 11:29.780
- So he stopped you for a broken taillight?
- I wasn't even driving wonkY.

11:30.670 --> 11:32.180
If I lose my license,I'll get fired.

11:32.300 --> 11:35.050
I need to be able to drive the
catering van.This is such bad timing.

11:36.150 --> 11:37.980
I've been trying to be a grown-up.

11:38.100 --> 11:39.770
Yeah,it's hard work,isn't it?

11:39.870 --> 11:43.010
Look,scotty,I may be able to
get an iffy ticket thrown out,

11:43.010 --> 11:45.060
but next time,will
you please take a cab?

11:45.170 --> 11:47.010
You know,the thought of you
in jail is pretty terrible,

11:47.080 --> 11:49.250
but someone hurt,that's worse.

11:49.370 --> 11:52.750
- Does this mean you'll help?
- Of course.

11:54.610 --> 11:57.130
- that is not what he looked like,dad.
- Oh,come on.

11:57.230 --> 11:59.770
I've got eyes in my head,little
girl.That prom date...

11:59.880 --> 12:02.260
sasquatch in a powder blue t.

12:02.380 --> 12:06.160
It was the same color as that karmann
ghia that tony campbell used to drive.

12:06.280 --> 12:07.190
It was a beetle.

12:07.310 --> 12:10.110
- He runs his own architecture firm now.
- Really?

12:10.230 --> 12:11.280
It's a tough business.

12:11.380 --> 12:14.270
Yeah,it's tougher still when you don't
have daddy's money to get you started.

12:14.370 --> 12:17.700
I always wondered why you didn't
go into architecture,jules.

12:17.810 --> 12:19.100
Well,she still could.

12:19.210 --> 12:21.280
My little girl can do
anything she sets her mind to.

12:21.400 --> 12:24.050
- I always wanted to be a dancer.
- No problem.

12:24.160 --> 12:26.510
Just have to amputate those
two left feet of yours.

12:30.880 --> 12:32.640
what?

12:32.770 --> 12:34.550
Nothing,it's just...

12:34.660 --> 12:36.790
it's nice to hear you laugh.

12:36.920 --> 12:39.460
- Well,I'll drink to that.
- hear,hear.

12:39.580 --> 12:42.770
- Cheers,dear.
- Cheers,dad.

12:43.120 --> 12:45.790
- You know,this pinot is not half bad.
- You sound surprised.

12:45.910 --> 12:49.770
Well,it's not like you've got that much
experience in the winemaking business.

12:49.900 --> 12:52.390
What I lack in experience I
make up for with hard work.

12:52.590 --> 12:56.510
Well,I think both of you
have been working too hard.

12:56.630 --> 12:59.020
Jules,what do you say tomorrow

12:59.130 --> 13:01.390
you and lizzie and i have an adventure?

13:01.500 --> 13:03.640
I would love to see
the huntington gardens.

13:03.770 --> 13:05.930
- That sounds great.
- good.

13:06.060 --> 13:07.440
And,uh,if the girls aren't around,

13:07.560 --> 13:10.480
uh,what do you say you and I
get into some trouble on our own?

13:10.590 --> 13:12.910
Trouble?

13:13.020 --> 13:14.740
Sign me up.

13:15.610 --> 13:17.490
Mom,thank you very much for dinner.

13:17.600 --> 13:19.730
I think I'm gonna go watch a little T...

13:19.820 --> 13:21.280
gonna go watch a little tv.

13:21.410 --> 13:22.360
- no,no,I got it.
- No,no,you know...

13:22.480 --> 13:23.640
- I got it.
- I can do it.

13:23.770 --> 13:26.080
When you're off the crutches,then
you can do the dishes,

13:26.200 --> 13:29.960
not that you've ever done them
before.So just go and lie down.

13:29.980 --> 13:32.350
All right,mom.

13:39.080 --> 13:41.480
It shouldn't still be this bad.

13:41.590 --> 13:44.330
I think he's doing much better
than when he first came home.

13:44.440 --> 13:45.590
In what way?

13:45.710 --> 13:47.380
I don't know,but I think
it's incredibly brave of

13:47.500 --> 13:49.590
him to try to get through
this without the drugs.

13:49.710 --> 13:53.570
It's not bra,it's pigheaded.He's
always been that way.

13:53.700 --> 13:57.140
Justin sets his mind on something...
it doesn't matter how wrong it is...

13:57.340 --> 13:59.470
I can't budge him.

13:59.580 --> 14:01.960
But how he takes care of that
knee over the next few months

14:02.090 --> 14:03.370
will affect the rest of his life.

14:03.500 --> 14:06.200
If he can't rehab properly
because of the pain...

14:06.320 --> 14:09.190
nora,have you tried
telling him all of this?

14:09.870 --> 14:11.640
Of course you have.You're you.

14:11.750 --> 14:14.120
That's why he won't listen to me.

14:14.680 --> 14:16.980
He'llisten to you,rebecca.

14:17.110 --> 14:19.790
Nora...I don't know.

14:19.890 --> 14:21.250
Please,I need your help.

14:21.360 --> 14:24.690
I just...I-I don't think I feel comfortable
trying to convince him to take drugs.

14:24.800 --> 14:26.270
Do you think I do?

14:26.360 --> 14:28.090
But I have talked to every doctor.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.980
I have googled every
web site in existence

14:31.100 --> 14:34.040
looking for another
option,and there isn't any.

14:34.160 --> 14:36.710
The only option I have
left is you,rebecca.

14:36.830 --> 14:39.760
Please,please,please talk to him.

14:41.120 --> 14:43.260
I'll try.

14:43.370 --> 14:45.560
Thank you.

14:50.430 --> 14:51.860
I stopped mr.Wandell,

14:51.990 --> 14:55.960
who was in a rusted orange 1972
ranchero missing a taillight.

14:56.070 --> 14:57.240
And you stopped him for the taillight?

14:57.370 --> 14:59.480
And felt that,

14:59.600 --> 15:03.400
because of his demeanor and his
breath,alcohol had been imbibed recently.

15:03.520 --> 15:06.700
- What was his demeanor?
- A lot of catty back talk.

15:06.820 --> 15:08.770
And you gave him a breathalyzer test?

15:08.890 --> 15:10.880
His blood alcohol level was .08,

15:10.990 --> 15:12.690
which is just over the legal limit.

15:12.810 --> 15:15.030
It also appeared he was
living in his vehicle.

15:15.160 --> 15:17.260
It's like an extra closet,is all.

15:17.370 --> 15:19.350
I don't think that's relevant,officer.

15:19.480 --> 15:21.300
And the breathalyzer machine
is accurate enough to be

15:21.420 --> 15:23.580
used as evidence in a court of
law in the state of california?

15:23.680 --> 15:25.140
Yeah,standard.

15:25.260 --> 15:28.780
Standard except when said breathalyzer
hasn't been calibrated every month.

15:28.910 --> 15:31.580
Your honor,I wish to introduce into
evidence,with the court's permission,

15:31.690 --> 15:37.180
the maintenance records for the instrument
in question... serial number 4-5-6-4-7-0-2.

15:37.450 --> 15:39.500
Oh,officer,if you'd like
to have a look at it,

15:39.630 --> 15:41.220
we'll happily wait for
you to put your gloves on,

15:41.380 --> 15:44.110
seeing as how you needed them
to inspect my client's license.

15:44.230 --> 15:47.000
Your honor,we take this
charge very seriously.

15:47.140 --> 15:50.090
However,it is not my expectation
when I ask,as a formality,

15:50.210 --> 15:52.700
to inspect the maintenance records
of the instrument in question,

15:52.820 --> 15:55.680
that two regularly scheduled
inspections were missed.

15:55.810 --> 15:57.280
- Officer phipps.
- Yes,your honor?

15:57.400 --> 15:59.460
Your honor,this invalidates
the basis of the case.

15:59.590 --> 16:02.160
And seeing as how my client's blood
alcohol was barely above the legal limit...

16:02.220 --> 16:05.030
- enough.Case dismissed.
- Thank you

16:05.040 --> 16:06.590
You got bubkes,son.

16:06.700 --> 16:09.060
He also called me "little
miss officer," your honor.

16:09.210 --> 16:11.950
Sue him for defamation.Next case.

16:13.910 --> 16:16.200
- you're my hero.
- I gotta get back to the office.

16:16.320 --> 16:20.180
- The pro bono circus hour's over.
- Look,um,I know I can't pay you,but...

16:21.210 --> 16:23.020
at least let me take you to dinner?

16:23.130 --> 16:27.560
- I can get us into san estephe.
- San estephe?Are you kidding?

16:27.630 --> 16:30.060
It takes months to get a reservation
there,and I know you can't afford it.

16:30.240 --> 16:32.280
And you know what?I'm not gonna
dine and ditch with you,scotty.

16:32.290 --> 16:36.980
You know,trust me,please.Just,like,a
little bit of faith?

17:08.069 --> 17:10.609
Oh,hey.What are you up to?

17:10.740 --> 17:13.460
I am going on a field
trip,and you're comin' with me.

17:13.680 --> 17:16.420
Yeah.Good luck getting
that past general walker.

17:16.550 --> 17:19.490
Yeah,well,she's out running
errands.Now's our chance.

17:26.740 --> 17:27.960
courtney.

17:28.040 --> 17:29.590
Well,you're traveling
without your entourage,

17:29.710 --> 17:32.440
so that begs the
question,what do you want?

17:32.570 --> 17:35.200
I think you know.

17:35.920 --> 17:38.260
- You look tired.
- I'm running for president.

17:38.370 --> 17:41.370
- Of course I'm tired.
- I'm not entirely sure I want to discuss this with you,robert.

17:41.470 --> 17:43.510
You never hear me when I speak,

17:43.640 --> 17:46.570
and you're better at debate than
I am,so why not spare ourselves?

17:46.710 --> 17:49.180
Can we go inside?Because
I think mrs.Anderson

17:49.300 --> 17:52.880
is probably shooting photos
for the "inquirer" as we speak.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.520
You don't have anything to be afraid of.

17:54.660 --> 17:57.810
I'm giving an honest account of what
it means to be the wife of a politician.

17:57.940 --> 17:59.760
What,you expect me
simply to be invisible?

17:59.900 --> 18:02.500
You gave up honesty the day you
accused me of screwing the nanny.

18:02.610 --> 18:04.720
Well,I don't know what happened.You
refused to talk about it.

18:04.840 --> 18:07.050
You refused to talk about
anything except your career,

18:07.170 --> 18:08.750
when you were even
here,which was rarely.

18:08.850 --> 18:10.310
So you're gonna go on television and

18:10.390 --> 18:12.470
play the victim and
search for a book deal?

18:12.580 --> 18:15.320
It is so cynical.I am asking you...

18:15.450 --> 18:17.810
what if you don't win the nomination?

18:17.960 --> 18:22.890
You taught me that timing is
everything,and it's a good story,right?

18:23.010 --> 18:26.320
The dutiful political wife
giving luncheons and speeches,

18:26.430 --> 18:28.700
helping brand your
mythology.I listened to you.

18:28.820 --> 18:30.590
I advised you,and you dropped me.

18:30.720 --> 18:32.870
Is this the same
self-justification you're gonna use

18:33.020 --> 18:35.550
when our children are old
enough to know that you lied?

18:35.700 --> 18:38.790
Well,they'll have kitty mccallister
by then,so what does it matter?

18:40.830 --> 18:42.740
You know,you are not
just slinging mud at me.

18:42.860 --> 18:46.020
You are completely defiling yourself.

18:46.140 --> 18:48.820
D I know you.You won't
be able to live with it.

18:48.930 --> 18:51.750
Well,it can't be any worse than
what I've lived with till now.

19:00.400 --> 19:02.920
- Why couldn't we go to a nice museum?
- I know.

19:03.040 --> 19:05.000
- You hate golf.
- I don't hate golf.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.070
I loathe it.I despise it.

19:07.180 --> 19:09.310
I would rather spend all
eternity at a dinner party seated

19:09.440 --> 19:13.070
next to britney spears than waste an afternoon
lugging clubs around a bunch of overfed,

19:13.190 --> 19:17.480
overprivileged arnold palmer
wannabes,but for you,I'll swallow it.

19:17.610 --> 19:20.500
Oh,except I have to
spend time with this putz.

19:20.620 --> 19:24.740
If you weren't here as a buffer,I
would wrap my 9-iron around his neck.

19:24.860 --> 19:27.830
Do it now and I'll
spot you three strokes.

19:27.950 --> 19:30.800
yes!That's what I'm talkin' about.

19:31.840 --> 19:35.000
- you boys are goin' down.
- Yeah,make it four.

19:37.870 --> 19:40.720
Buck up,son.We'll find
something you're good at.

19:42.410 --> 19:44.520
you know what,ben?Your
folksy shtick,it's...

19:44.770 --> 19:46.890
it's getting a little bit old.

19:47.000 --> 19:49.420
So,uh,we're being honest now,are we?

19:49.520 --> 19:53.320
- Yeah.You bet.
- Then open your eyes.

19:53.440 --> 19:55.590
- Julia's in trouble.
- You've been here 24 hours,

19:55.700 --> 19:57.030
and you think you know what's going on?

19:57.140 --> 20:01.320
E calls us most every night,sobbing.

20:01.440 --> 20:02.940
- Did you know that?
- Of course I know that.

20:03.050 --> 20:04.930
- She's my wife.
- Then help her.

20:05.040 --> 20:08.220
- What's going on,tommy?
- We're leaving.Now.

20:10.130 --> 20:12.380
Look,I want you out of my house,tonight.

20:12.510 --> 20:14.490
Oh,you got that right,tom.

20:14.610 --> 20:16.760
And since you can't
take care of your family,

20:16.890 --> 20:19.790
I'm taking julia and lizzie with me.

20:22.060 --> 20:24.050
when did you start taking pictures?

20:24.160 --> 20:27.360
This summer,right after
my sculpture phase,

20:27.470 --> 20:29.710
but right before dabbling in french.

20:29.820 --> 20:32.110
It's quite impressive.

20:35.580 --> 20:38.100
you know,I tried to,um...

20:38.230 --> 20:40.960
I tried to imagine what it
was like out there for you.

20:41.080 --> 20:42.530
I just couldn't see it.

20:42.630 --> 20:46.510
Even when I saw news footage,it
just didn't seem real.

20:46.610 --> 20:48.480
Yeah.

20:49.220 --> 20:52.290
If you ever need to talk...

20:53.770 --> 20:55.860
- can we get the check?
- Yeah.

20:57.040 --> 21:01.040
I was talking to your
mom.She's worried about you.

21:01.690 --> 21:03.670
She's really worried
about your pain level.

21:03.800 --> 21:06.310
I know,but you know what?I had
surgery.I'm gonna feel pain.

21:06.420 --> 21:09.790
Yeah,but there wouldn't be if you took the
pain medication they prescribed for you.

21:11.380 --> 21:13.580
Thank you very much.

21:13.810 --> 21:14.830
- Oh.
- I'll get that.

21:14.950 --> 21:17.170
- ah!Ah!
- justin?

21:17.290 --> 21:20.350
Justin,what...what happened?

21:20.460 --> 21:22.640
What can I do?

21:29.880 --> 21:32.170
- Okay,ready?
- Yeah.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.040
- One,two,three.
- Careful.Careful.Careful.

21:33.150 --> 21:35.910
- I'm sorry.
- oh,god.

21:35.920 --> 21:37.980
Okay.

21:38.090 --> 21:41.850
Just try to get some rest,okay?

21:49.010 --> 21:52.140
nora?Nora,are you mad at me?

21:52.260 --> 21:54.430
I didn't say that.

21:54.650 --> 21:55.600
You are.You're mad at me.

21:55.700 --> 21:57.120
That's what my mom does
when she's mad at me.

21:57.240 --> 22:00.010
You took him out without his wheelchair.

22:00.120 --> 22:02.900
I was trying to talk to him about
the painkillers likeou asked me to.

22:03.020 --> 22:04.450
Remember "operation nora"?

22:04.580 --> 22:09.010
Operation nora was,"hey,justin,"why
don't we wheel into the living om "

22:09.130 --> 22:12.360
so I might discuss with you the
advantages of the pain medication?

22:12.470 --> 22:14.860
" Operation nora was
not a trip downtown.

22:14.960 --> 22:16.690
Oh,'cause you think that's what
I was trying to achieve today,

22:16.810 --> 22:19.650
- him having an attack like that?
- Well,what were you thinking?

22:19.740 --> 22:23.750
Oh,I don't know.Maybe get his
mind off of things a little bit?

22:23.880 --> 22:25.970
Remind him that his life can be fun?

22:26.080 --> 22:29.210
It won't be fun again
for a very,very long time.

22:29.330 --> 22:31.200
Okay,you know what?I
was trying to help you.

22:31.320 --> 22:33.410
I'm sorry if I didn't do it
exactly the way you wanted me to.

22:33.530 --> 22:35.090
Maybe you should write
me a script next time.

22:35.220 --> 22:36.860
- That's not fair.
- Well,I'm trying.

22:36.980 --> 22:39.870
- None of this is my fault.
- Yes,iis...

22:40.450 --> 22:43.890
some of it.A little of it.

22:45.300 --> 22:47.160
I'm sorry.

22:48.910 --> 22:51.390
Oh,I'm sorry.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.270
I'm not mad at you.

22:54.390 --> 22:56.340
God,I'm not mad at you.

22:56.460 --> 22:58.040
I...I'm mad at everyone else.

22:58.160 --> 23:00.040
I'm still mad at justin for signing up.

23:00.160 --> 23:02.810
I'm...I'm mad at his dead
father for letting him go

23:02.930 --> 23:05.860
even though begged him not to.

23:06.020 --> 23:07.910
Even last year,

23:08.050 --> 23:12.460
even with william's death,amidst it
all,tre was always this sense of...

23:12.570 --> 23:15.800
of reason to it.

23:15.930 --> 23:18.190
But not with this.

23:18.310 --> 23:21.110
This time...

23:21.220 --> 23:23.860
there's only pain.

23:23.970 --> 23:27.370
That's why I want him
to take his medication.

23:28.350 --> 23:31.880
The only good that will
come out of any of this...

23:33.100 --> 23:36.430
is when it finally stops.

23:45.450 --> 23:46.820
let me pull another one for you,okay?

23:47.590 --> 23:50.390
Come on in.It's all
right.Don't be afraid.

23:51.370 --> 23:54.390
Uh,are...are we allowed to be in here?

23:54.500 --> 23:57.510
'Cause usually 5-star restaurants don't like
the patrons entering through the alleyway.

23:57.620 --> 24:00.960
Actually,the restaurant
is closed for another hour.

24:01.070 --> 24:02.990
Please have a seat.

24:03.100 --> 24:07.160
And a nice white burgundy
for you while I work.

24:07.290 --> 24:09.530
- You work here?
- I am still a cater waiter.

24:09.630 --> 24:13.380
I am still dirt poor,but I have been
putting myself through chef school

24:13.500 --> 24:14.780
in pasadena.

24:14.910 --> 24:19.100
I came in top of my ass and won an
internship here as apprentice sous chef.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.200
The lobster ravioli in a meyer lemon

24:21.310 --> 24:25.130
and butter emulsion on a bed
of sauteed baby watercress...

24:25.560 --> 24:27.700
and fried capers.

24:27.810 --> 24:29.210
You made this?

24:29.330 --> 24:30.720
Kevin,in less than an hour,

24:30.860 --> 24:34.880
people will pour through those doors,and
this place will be a madhouse until midnight.

24:34.990 --> 24:39.300
And then the staff,totally wired
and really beat,we have some wine.

24:39.610 --> 24:41.730
See,I wasn't drunk.

24:41.840 --> 24:45.800
It was the end of my first month
here,and I was really happy because...

24:46.740 --> 24:49.080
I was changing my life.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.010
So...

24:51.120 --> 24:54.230
thank you.

24:55.010 --> 24:57.120
To changing our lives.

24:57.240 --> 24:59.530
Americans need a new
kind of leadership...

24:59.660 --> 25:02.220
- bold,modern and traditional...
- how bad was it?

25:02.350 --> 25:06.060
I had frostbite.I could've used a parka.

25:06.070 --> 25:07.030
What are you thinking?

25:07.130 --> 25:09.310
Well,I'm not gonna stand around
on the sidelines and watch.

25:09.430 --> 25:11.960
- You're gonna go see her.
- Ye,I am.Look around,robert.

25:12.090 --> 25:14.110
We're in an auditorium full
of high school teachers.

25:14.220 --> 25:16.560
They're not gonna elect
henry viii as president.

25:16.690 --> 25:20.340
No,I'm going to do my job.But I...

25:20.470 --> 25:22.960
I'm sorry,but I need to ask you.

25:23.080 --> 25:24.740
The nanny story...is it ever
gonna blow up in our face?

25:24.840 --> 25:26.560
I told you the first time it came up.

25:26.670 --> 25:27.780
- No.
- with that,ladies and gentlemen...

25:28.210 --> 25:30.620
- okay?
- I give you the next leader of the free world...

25:30.730 --> 25:36.100
- now let me go talk to these teachers.
- An america hero... senator robert mccallister!

25:39.160 --> 25:40.990
thank you.

25:41.670 --> 25:45.200
Oh,so get this.Your dad was
to take you and elizabeth home,

25:45.320 --> 25:48.290
and not just for the weekend.

25:48.700 --> 25:51.820
I think it's a good
idea.Just for a while.

25:51.900 --> 25:55.690
- I can clear my head.
- Clear it of what?

25:56.170 --> 25:59.160
Please try and understand.

26:00.050 --> 26:03.370
it'll be easier this way.I know
it doesn't seem fair or rational...

26:03.470 --> 26:06.770
- what do you mean?
- I can't,tommy.It's too hard.

26:06.890 --> 26:10.060
What's too hard,julia?What?What
are you talkin' about?

26:11.930 --> 26:14.060
William's death.

26:14.180 --> 26:17.040
You pressured me to go
to the vineyard that day.

26:17.180 --> 26:20.360
And at the hospital,I'd
just had the babies.

26:20.460 --> 26:24.020
I needed some time,and you
kept pressing me for a decision.

26:24.140 --> 26:25.830
And I didn't know what to do.

26:26.090 --> 26:28.550
- So you decided that...
- that is not true,julia.

26:28.660 --> 26:30.970
- We decided together.
- Okay,I know,I know,I know it's crazy.

26:31.080 --> 26:34.420
I do,okay?But I can't help it.

26:34.520 --> 26:39.020
I blame you,tommy.I
want to get past this.

26:39.110 --> 26:41.840
I think if I go away,I'll be
able to put it in perspective.

26:41.950 --> 26:44.240
You think?

26:44.720 --> 26:46.630
I need this.

26:46.730 --> 26:49.400
Otherwise we're not gonna make it.

26:52.500 --> 26:54.820
I am so impressed at how you've
pulled your life together.

26:54.950 --> 26:56.510
Does this mean I can't
tease you anymore?

26:56.640 --> 26:58.680
No,please,never stop teasing me.

26:58.810 --> 27:01.840
It is gonna take a lot of meals like
this for you to pay your legal bill,sir.

27:01.880 --> 27:03.870
That's fine by me.

27:07.710 --> 27:09.650
- You know what?I... I'm just...I mean...
- oh.Oh,god.No.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.740
- I'm sorry.
- No,no,no.

27:11.850 --> 27:15.170
- Scotty,scotty,I'm in a relationship.
- Oh!

27:15.750 --> 27:18.410
Oh,so I guess I'mot the
only one who's changed.

27:18.920 --> 27:21.020
Who?

27:21.150 --> 27:25.900
Uh,he's...he's the... the
brother of my sister's fiance,

27:26.030 --> 27:27.330
and it's,you know,it's...

27:27.440 --> 27:29.370
- the minister?
- Yeah.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.910
Oh,god.Wow.

27:32.900 --> 27:34.490
Where's his church?

27:34.630 --> 27:36.760
Uh,malaysia.

27:36.890 --> 27:38.940
Excuse me?Rtesia?

27:39.060 --> 27:41.860
Malaysia,on an island called,um,

27:41.980 --> 27:46.680
tioman,uh,which you might recognize
from the movie "south pacific."

27:46.780 --> 27:48.850
So he's really available.

27:48.940 --> 27:51.710
You know,tioman is famous for,uh,

27:51.840 --> 27:54.150
the red flying squirrels and,um,the...

27:54.290 --> 27:57.000
the slow loris and the walking catfish.

27:57.110 --> 27:59.260
Well,I'm really happy for you...

27:59.390 --> 28:02.470
all of you,including the catfish.

28:02.590 --> 28:05.780
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah,me,too.

28:07.150 --> 28:09.110
Um,I should probably get back to work.

28:09.170 --> 28:12.980
It's about to get busy,and I need some
time to poach my fool head in vermouth.

28:13.100 --> 28:15.470
You know,it's... it's just timing.

28:16.210 --> 28:17.910
Thank you.

28:28.810 --> 28:31.510
- how bad is it?
- It's pretty bad.

28:37.390 --> 28:39.270
Honey,I wish you'd reconsider.

28:39.370 --> 28:41.640
Don't you think I want
to take the pills,mom?

28:41.730 --> 28:43.820
Then why don't you?

28:43.930 --> 28:47.330
the doctors have said we could monitor
the dosage.We'd be very careful.

28:47.340 --> 28:49.470
Don't you get it?I'm lucky.

28:49.590 --> 28:52.710
My friends are dying over
there,mom.I got off easy.

28:52.740 --> 28:54.830
Are you punishing yourself?

28:55.130 --> 28:57.780
I don't know.I don't know what
I'm doing,mom.I don't know.

28:57.910 --> 29:01.210
Listen to me.No one,no one wants you
to hurt any more than you have to.

29:01.340 --> 29:05.440
You didn't create this war.The fact that
you're here alive and someone else isn't...

29:06.080 --> 29:08.860
it isn't fair,it's
awful,but it's a gift.

29:09.090 --> 29:11.660
- It hurts so much.
- I know.

29:12.540 --> 29:15.850
- I know.I know.I know.
- It hurts so bad.

29:17.060 --> 29:20.240
I'm here.I'll do whatever you want.

29:22.960 --> 29:25.920
I want you to fill the prescription.

29:26.010 --> 29:28.310
Okay.

29:28.420 --> 29:30.270
I already called it in.I
just have to pick it up.

29:30.380 --> 29:33.780
Of course you did.That's not surprising.

29:34.920 --> 29:37.810
- It'll be okay.
- Okay.

29:40.400 --> 29:43.340
- Scotty,I...wait...
- kevin,I am so working right now.I can't talk.

29:43.460 --> 29:46.240
- I'm sorry I made assumptions...
- stop,okay?Listen.

29:47.670 --> 29:49.780
We...we were never friends.

29:49.910 --> 29:52.670
We jt went straight to
being lovers,then fighters.

29:52.790 --> 29:56.040
And seeing as the only gay
friends I have are my sisters,

29:56.460 --> 29:58.640
maybe we could try that.

29:59.040 --> 30:00.430
Kevin...

30:00.540 --> 30:01.880
if I don't get this
perfectly cooked piece

30:02.000 --> 30:03.800
of copper river salmon to
david beckham at table three,

30:03.930 --> 30:05.810
you'll have to hire me
as your personal chef.

30:05.910 --> 30:07.700
- He's here?
- Yes.

30:07.830 --> 30:09.610
I'll call you later.

30:10.150 --> 30:12.250
- Now go.
- Okay.

30:18.310 --> 30:20.890
I have one mine for you,miss walker.

30:21.010 --> 30:25.400
I have to finish baking a rhubarb cherry
pie for the sidwell friends school auction.

30:26.500 --> 30:29.490
I just don't understand
why you're doing this.

30:32.580 --> 30:35.250
This is about identity.

30:35.370 --> 30:38.410
You see?Mine,not his.

30:38.530 --> 30:41.560
You actually have no idea
what it's like,do you,

30:41.660 --> 30:44.420
To have your whole life
with someone erased...

30:44.530 --> 30:48.620
to be by his side and,uh,

30:48.940 --> 30:51.820
and to have given up some
very real part of yourself,

30:51.930 --> 30:55.630
your own dreams,so that
your mate can save the world.

30:55.770 --> 30:58.680
I'm not here to get into the middle
of your relationship with robert.

30:58.800 --> 31:02.730
I just wanted to let you
know that I found bridget...

31:03.170 --> 31:08.790
the nanny... and for the
record,yes,she did love robert...

31:08.900 --> 31:12.220
just as she loved you and just
as she loved your children.

31:12.990 --> 31:16.070
And just so you and i are utterly clear,

31:16.190 --> 31:18.410
she's willing to tell the truth.

31:19.060 --> 31:23.240
And I just thought maybeou would wa
that information on the eve of your...

31:23.360 --> 31:26.080
presentation.

31:26.190 --> 31:29.410
Thank you for your time,and,uh...

31:29.510 --> 31:32.520
say hi to larry.

31:34.160 --> 31:37.950
You think you're his
partner?Nobody's his partner.

31:38.080 --> 31:41.070
He does it all alone.

31:42.720 --> 31:45.980
I'll let myself out.

31:52.250 --> 31:54.890
Tommy.What are you doing here?

31:55.010 --> 31:58.000
I had to,uh,grab some stuff to,

31:58.150 --> 32:00.580
uh,bring back to the vineyard,and,uh,

32:00.670 --> 32:02.630
- I had to get out of that house
- why?

32:02.720 --> 32:05.490
Did something else happen?

32:12.930 --> 32:15.230
Julia wants to take the baby and

32:15.370 --> 32:17.330
go home with her parents to arizona.

32:17.460 --> 32:21.020
Come on,tommy,that can't be julia.It's
got to be her son-of-a-bitch father.

32:21.050 --> 32:24.830
No.It's her.

32:24.950 --> 32:28.640
- Apparently,she blames me for william's death.
- What?

32:28.740 --> 32:30.930
She came right out
and...and...and said it.

32:31.050 --> 32:34.870
But we both made that
decision.We both did,and...

32:34.990 --> 32:39.990
and now,saul,she's furious at me for
some revised version of the truth.

32:40.120 --> 32:41.610
She's grieving,tommy.

32:41.730 --> 32:44.490
Fine,but do you know
how I deal with my grief?

32:44.610 --> 32:46.950
I focus on julia and elizabeth.

32:47.060 --> 32:49.540
All day I think about
coming home to them.

32:49.670 --> 32:52.400
Yeah,but that's how you're getting
through this,tomm she can't do it your way.

32:52.410 --> 32:55.820
Great,so what do you want me to
do,just...just sit back and...and watch her go?

32:56.850 --> 32:59.690
Well,maybe you have to find it
in you to let her grieve her way.

32:59.790 --> 33:01.990
I don't know if I can.

33:05.250 --> 33:06.920
I don't know.

33:07.030 --> 33:08.970
I know that we can get
equal time on larry,

33:09.090 --> 33:10.760
but we may have to do
one of the morning shows,

33:10.770 --> 33:14.700
depending on whatever

Okay.Thanks.

37:59.950 --> 38:01.660

38:01.760 --> 38:05.270
He had 160 milligrams
about a half an hour ago.

38:05.540 --> 38:10.400
A pain level of 7
would be at a 2 by now.

38:10.520 --> 38:13.180
God,I hate knowing so
much about this stuff.

38:13.290 --> 38:15.730
Well,thank god that you do.

38:16.480 --> 38:19.110

38:21.630 --> 38:23.010
Where are julia and lizzie?

38:23.120 --> 38:25.980
Uh,lia took the baby to
go see her...her folks.

38:26.090 --> 38:30.000
Brother never met her,so,uh,I
figured I'd come hang out with justin.

38:30.120 --> 38:33.040
I'm so glad you did.I'm
gonna give this to rebecca.

38:34.120 --> 38:36.920
So,uh,how is he?

38:39.900 --> 38:41.820
We're making hot fudge
sundaes down there.

38:41.940 --> 38:43.550
You want to raise your cholesterol?

38:43.670 --> 38:46.170
Oh,thank you.

38:51.840 --> 38:54.070
did you give justin the pills?

38:54.200 --> 38:56.540
Yes.

38:56.670 --> 39:00.890
Oh,god,I don't ever
remember being this tired.

39:03.550 --> 39:05.870
Thank you for your help.

39:05.970 --> 39:10.710
It's a little humbling to realize you're not the
one in the best position to help your own son.

39:10.860 --> 39:13.720
It's okay.

39:13.830 --> 39:17.020
kinda makes me feel like
I'm part of the family.

39:17.130 --> 39:20.580
You are part of the family,rebecca.

39:22.250 --> 39:25.780
Nora,I have a lot of
friends who are addicts...

39:25.890 --> 39:28.810
and when they head
back down this road...

39:28.940 --> 39:33.240
starting now,everything changes.You
have to lock things up,count his pills.

39:33.550 --> 39:37.160
He might not be justin for a while.

39:37.680 --> 39:40.750
I know.

39:42.320 --> 39:43.360
I know.

39:43.470 --> 39:45.120
Why don't you use a bowl
like any other human being?

39:45.230 --> 39:47.880
- It's better this way.
- You don't eat a sundae from a cup.

39:48.000 --> 39:51.200
- Jus!
- Well,if it isn't tiny tim.

39:51.760 --> 39:54.310
Please,sir,may I have a turkey?

39:54.310 --> 39:57.280
God,you're mixing your
dickens.It was a goose,dumb-ass.

39:57.390 --> 39:58.650
- No,it wasn'T.
- Yeah,it was.

39:58.750 --> 40:00.560
- What the hell are you guys talking about?
- "A christmas carol."

40:00.590 --> 40:03.960
No,it wasn'T.It was a turkey.I
played tiny tim,remember?

40:04.070 --> 40:06.000
So did I.So did you,tommy.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.640
No,I don't do plays,kevin.

40:07.740 --> 40:11.320

grade,mrs.Blake?Muumuus,orange lipstick?

40:11.430 --> 40:13.150
- Nope,nope,drawin' a blank.

40:13.180 --> 40:17.850
You...mom,you can settle this.We
all played tiny tim,right?

40:17.910 --> 40:21.420
- Oh.Well,you were all the smallest in your class.
-I was?

40:21.430 --> 40:22.500
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

40:22.520 --> 40:23.900
- No.
- yes.

40:24.020 --> 40:26.660
- What,grade school was a blur?
- I guess so.

40:27.150 --> 40:29.420
Justin,want me to make you a sundae?

40:29.990 --> 40:32.510
Yeah,sure.That'd be great.

40:35.170 --> 40:37.040
