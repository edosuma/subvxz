01:53.046 --> 01:55.349
Ida: Hey, let's
ban the redskins.

01:57.218 --> 01:58.595
Let's ban the redskins.

01:58.619 --> 02:00.288
Let's remove that hurtful word.

02:09.729 --> 02:13.310
But don't we kick their boompers
without her help anyhow?

02:13.334 --> 02:15.044
Yeah. I don't really
think it's that.

02:15.068 --> 02:17.505
I think she's just
disturbed by the name.

02:18.105 --> 02:19.307
Ban the redskins?

02:21.742 --> 02:23.052
What?

02:23.076 --> 02:25.213
Redskins is a badass name.

02:47.368 --> 02:50.747
See, you need to say you're sorry
and maybe I'll let you go in an...

02:50.771 --> 02:52.048
Ow!

02:52.072 --> 02:53.274
Hey, sugranis.

02:53.941 --> 02:55.609
Gavin.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.873
Bye. I'd tap that.

04:01.208 --> 04:03.019
Do your heist on the street kid.

04:03.043 --> 04:05.779
Her boyfriend has a buick, sugranis.
Have you seen him?

04:06.447 --> 04:07.724
Can't miss him, thorvald.

04:07.748 --> 04:09.850
For him, a buick's
a choking hazard.

04:14.555 --> 04:16.857
Candy? Do you have nut candy?

04:19.959 --> 04:20.961
Five bucks.

04:21.928 --> 04:23.263
That's morning prices.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.742
Last one.

04:25.766 --> 04:28.144
It's not a collector's
item, sugranis.

04:28.168 --> 04:30.113
Well, right now it's
a limited edition.

04:30.137 --> 04:32.015
Yeah, and I'm an angel investor.

04:32.039 --> 04:34.608
Well, then there'll be a
rebate in future, angel.

04:35.976 --> 04:37.987
Step up. Hi, sugranis.

04:38.011 --> 04:39.155
Oh, hi, Mrs. Thorvald.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.514
How was your day, thorvald?

04:40.981 --> 04:43.693
Mom, I feel offended

04:43.717 --> 04:46.830
as a Norwegian-American
by the vikings name,

04:46.854 --> 04:48.064
logo and mascot.

04:48.088 --> 04:49.357
That's your home team.

04:49.923 --> 04:50.800
I know.

04:50.824 --> 04:53.269
Well, they don't mean
anything by that.

04:53.293 --> 04:54.895
Like the redskins. Yeah.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.844
You should draw up
a petition, son.

05:11.812 --> 05:12.989
Will you sign it?

05:13.013 --> 05:14.624
Oh, no. I like the vikes.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.050
You know it's a
slang term, right?

05:17.685 --> 05:18.595
So?

05:18.619 --> 05:20.964
Well, your dad makes
a good point, son.

05:20.988 --> 05:24.267
Viking is a strong stoic figure
in the spirit of the game.

05:24.291 --> 05:25.959
It's kinda fun, don't you think?

05:26.627 --> 05:27.504
No.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.906
They're not ill
intended, thorvald.

05:29.930 --> 05:34.344
Yeah, your uncle bill, he played high
school ball for the pekin chinks.

05:34.368 --> 05:36.245
Oh, no! He did not!

05:36.269 --> 05:38.782
Yeah, I was a chink. See?

05:38.806 --> 05:40.450
Mrs. Thovson: Oh, I don't know.

05:40.474 --> 05:42.486
Oh, sure, a couple,
two-three seasons.

05:42.510 --> 05:44.554
Remember that guy... You
were just a little squirt.

05:44.578 --> 05:47.156
Yeah, then mom and dad
moved us to the city,

05:47.180 --> 05:48.825
and you went to Chicago.
Mmm-hmm.

05:48.849 --> 05:51.495
Oh, they didn't call it that,
though, the team, right.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.897
The chinks? They couldn't
have called it that.

05:53.921 --> 05:57.434
Well, word around town was if you
dug straight through the earth

05:57.458 --> 06:00.336
from pekin, you would end
up in Peking, China.

06:00.360 --> 06:03.473
So pekin, Peking, China, chinks.

06:03.497 --> 06:06.376
I mean, you know, that
was their math on that.

06:06.400 --> 06:08.011
Well. Right?

06:08.035 --> 06:10.414
Because what kind of idiot is
trying to dig all the way to China.

06:10.438 --> 06:11.915
I mean you gotta plan for that.

06:11.939 --> 06:13.006
Yeah, you do.

06:57.485 --> 06:59.563
It was a small little
diminutive man.

06:59.587 --> 07:01.330
Oh, my goodness.

07:01.354 --> 07:02.566
War head, it was made...

07:02.590 --> 07:04.333
Well, what about the
students who were

07:04.357 --> 07:05.502
you know who were
from over there?

07:05.526 --> 07:07.103
Were they upset? We
didn't have any.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.005
No, they weren't any of those.

07:09.029 --> 07:10.106
There was nobody?

07:10.130 --> 07:11.675
No. Not even a one.

07:11.699 --> 07:13.376
No, not that... unless we didn't see
them because they were so small.

07:13.400 --> 07:16.546
There might have been. Oh,
no, they were not hiding.

07:16.570 --> 07:18.014
They may... they
were crafty too.

07:18.038 --> 07:20.173
No... I don't know. Yeah. Yeah.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.814
Sign our petition to change
the name of the vikings?

07:50.838 --> 07:52.773
We find it disturbing,
don't you?

07:53.240 --> 07:54.684
Sign our petition.

07:54.708 --> 07:55.985
It's disturbing.

07:56.009 --> 07:59.923
No. Sugranis, the petition
isn't disturbing.

07:59.947 --> 08:03.593
Using a discriminatory
and defamatory term

08:03.617 --> 08:05.085
for the team name is.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.133
Take a flyer.

08:10.157 --> 08:11.592
Here, take a flyer.

08:12.960 --> 08:14.061
Flyer.

08:15.428 --> 08:17.874
I like your occupy the
mall idea, thorvald.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.143
It's a good one, right? Yeah.

08:20.167 --> 08:22.478
I could recruit some
more guys for next time.

08:22.502 --> 08:25.148
Yeah. This is a pretty
good dry run though.

08:25.172 --> 08:26.173
Yeah, it is.

08:28.408 --> 08:31.020
Sign our petition to
change the vikings.

08:31.044 --> 08:34.147
Oh, no. You guys okay?

10:53.954 --> 10:57.224
You know, I can write you a
warning citation for loitering.

10:57.991 --> 11:00.236
Did you get my orange Julius?

11:00.260 --> 11:03.406
Yeah, I got your orange Julius. It's
at the exit, let's go. Come on.

11:03.430 --> 11:05.208
Come on, up. Seriously?

11:05.232 --> 11:06.867
No. Get, kid.

11:33.493 --> 11:35.195
I'm a vikings fan, a die hard.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.974
Go vikes!

11:37.998 --> 11:41.110
And, I was the assistant team
manager in my senior year,

11:41.134 --> 11:43.303
and it would be a shame
for you to mess that up.

11:44.838 --> 11:47.951
On the other hand, nobody cares.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.652
So what're you really
gonna mess up?

11:49.676 --> 11:51.187
So I can sign your petition.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.957
Because I like you and
nobody's gonna see it, right?

11:53.981 --> 11:54.982
Right.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.696
What if somebody else who
likes you does see it?

12:00.720 --> 12:02.598
Signs it and sees my name?

12:02.622 --> 12:05.368
They're gonna think that I think there's
good sound thinking in that petition.

12:05.392 --> 12:07.895
I mean, it's our own school
for crying out loud.

12:09.997 --> 12:12.708
See? There's always
that to consider.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.977
It's a gambit.

12:14.001 --> 12:16.045
I can start doing deliveries.

12:16.069 --> 12:18.281
I get my license next week.

12:18.305 --> 12:19.406
We don't do deliveries.

12:20.808 --> 12:22.752
We could start.

12:22.776 --> 12:25.288
Hm... I like your thinking.

12:25.312 --> 12:27.223
Of course, then you'll be
walking through our mall and

12:27.247 --> 12:29.092
I'd have to get a
delivery vehicle,

12:29.116 --> 12:31.494
hey, don't forget to wear a hat.

12:31.518 --> 12:32.628
Even after hours.

12:32.652 --> 12:34.497
Corporate approval
and compliance,

12:34.521 --> 12:37.000
and paperwork, I mean all
that stuff has got to add up.

12:37.024 --> 12:38.601
I'm never gonna get
any of that done.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.003
Who's gonna insure
you, thorvald?

12:40.027 --> 12:41.394
Who's gonna insure you, buddy?

12:43.230 --> 12:44.264
Cool.

13:11.791 --> 13:13.160
I know who you are.

13:13.927 --> 13:15.228
Why f with the yikes?

13:16.263 --> 13:18.341
Because I...

13:18.365 --> 13:19.405
What do you want with ida?

13:21.201 --> 13:23.146
Oh, she just did such
a great job with

13:23.170 --> 13:26.249
the redskin buttons. I thought...
you know...

13:26.273 --> 13:31.111
Okay. You know she's angling to change
their name to the foreskins. Right?

13:45.592 --> 13:48.838
You should have refused to play them until
they changed their oppressive name.

13:48.862 --> 13:50.931
Yeah, forfeit? No way.

13:52.399 --> 13:53.476
Hi, thorvald.

13:53.500 --> 13:54.501
Hey.

13:55.035 --> 13:56.336
Be careful, thorvald.

14:01.041 --> 14:02.451
Don't mind Blaine.

14:02.475 --> 14:03.476
I don't.

14:05.078 --> 14:06.455
What can I do you for?

14:06.479 --> 14:07.881
You can do me for free.

14:24.998 --> 14:26.209
I can ask him for you.

14:26.233 --> 14:29.069
Uh, yeah, that would be great.
Thank you.

14:29.802 --> 14:31.038
Oh and then some.

14:32.572 --> 14:34.007
Cute. Yeah.

14:36.443 --> 14:37.720
Do you have a slogan?

14:37.744 --> 14:39.488
I mean, you need a slogan.

14:39.512 --> 14:41.314
Yeah, I was, uh...

14:55.963 --> 14:58.531
No, uh... it's good.

14:59.632 --> 15:00.977
Thanks.

15:01.001 --> 15:04.671
You know, people say "go vikes"

15:05.905 --> 15:07.783
you could say, "no vikes."

15:07.807 --> 15:10.243
To the point. I like it. Yeah.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.545
Thank you. It's creative.

15:13.346 --> 15:14.381
Thanks.

15:15.315 --> 15:17.684
I mean thank you.
Are you an Indian?

15:19.452 --> 15:20.620
No.

15:22.189 --> 15:23.933
Cool.

15:23.957 --> 15:25.692
And I'm not a Scandinavian
either but...

15:26.693 --> 15:28.061
I'm glad to help the cause.

15:28.996 --> 15:30.806
What about t-bone?

15:30.830 --> 15:32.575
Eh, Blaine. I mean...

15:32.599 --> 15:34.767
Oh, no, don't sweat it.

16:08.901 --> 16:10.346
Hey, Astrid.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.371
Hey, loser.

16:12.972 --> 16:14.241
What?

16:54.847 --> 16:56.049
You're a dick.

16:56.349 --> 16:58.227
Dick.

16:58.251 --> 17:01.421
You two are freshmen. You
can't talk to me like that.

17:22.242 --> 17:23.452
Mrs. Thovson: Thorvald.

17:23.476 --> 17:26.722
Thorvald: Yeah. No bombs
in the yard, son.

17:26.746 --> 17:28.047
Thorvald: Okay.

17:43.763 --> 17:44.831
Me neither.

17:46.099 --> 17:48.144
She's a citizen of discipline.

17:48.168 --> 17:49.369
And I want her.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.505
No, you don't. Do you?

17:56.276 --> 17:58.745
We could use some proper
wisdom from this guy. Look.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.358
Elusive community organizer.

18:02.382 --> 18:04.393
Looks busy, if you
could see him.

18:04.417 --> 18:07.330
That's because he knows
what he is doing, sugranis.

18:07.354 --> 18:09.489
Keep in mind I get
my wisdom from you.

18:27.840 --> 18:28.917
Mrs. Thovson: Thorvald!

18:28.941 --> 18:30.277
I'm sorry.

18:39.085 --> 18:40.563
What?

18:40.587 --> 18:44.191
Do you know manifestus devers?

18:45.057 --> 18:46.359
Man: Who wants to know?

18:47.126 --> 18:48.628
Uh, thorvald.

18:49.529 --> 18:52.175
Man: What do you want, cracker?

18:52.199 --> 18:55.902
I'm seeking his help regarding
standing up for the disenfranchised.

18:57.036 --> 18:58.238
Man: Get lost!

19:02.709 --> 19:03.843
Hey, cracker.

19:05.111 --> 19:06.313
Hey, hi.

19:07.947 --> 19:11.427
God damn you white, you
mind if I call you cracker?

19:11.451 --> 19:12.695
Uh, no.

19:12.719 --> 19:15.398
Okay, cracker. What're you
doing in this part of town?

19:15.422 --> 19:17.466
Do you know manifestus devers?

19:17.490 --> 19:20.536
Do I know mani... No,
I don't know him.

19:20.560 --> 19:22.771
He's around from time to time.

19:22.795 --> 19:24.940
Why? What do you want with him?

19:24.964 --> 19:28.167
I'm contacting him regarding speaking
out for the disenfranchised.

19:29.068 --> 19:30.246
Really?

19:30.270 --> 19:32.748
And who is disenfranchised?

19:32.772 --> 19:36.585
I'm offended by baker high
using the name vikings.

19:36.609 --> 19:39.054
But you're cool with me
calling you cracker?

19:39.078 --> 19:43.316
'Cause I'm trying to help
local scandinavians who feel.

19:55.828 --> 19:58.574
I thought if I could get
some tips from manifestus...

19:58.598 --> 20:01.444
You know, if he's available?

20:01.468 --> 20:03.111
Ah, look, I don't know kid.

20:03.135 --> 20:06.249
I suppose I could check with him
next time he's around, you know.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.083
Awesome. Yeah. Awesome.

20:08.107 --> 20:09.742
Yeah, and then some...

20:12.211 --> 20:14.923
Okay, cool. I'm just going to
write my cell phone number.

20:14.947 --> 20:18.527
If you could have manifestus
you know, give me a buzz,

20:18.551 --> 20:21.630
shoot me a text,
that will be great.

20:21.654 --> 20:24.223
And I'm actually gonna
give my home number too,

21:37.229 --> 21:38.431
Ow!

21:39.832 --> 21:40.676
Motherfuc...

21:40.700 --> 21:42.369
Why did you hit me? I
did what you said?

21:51.210 --> 21:53.121
Punched me in my back. I know.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.490
You're holding that thing wrong.

21:54.514 --> 21:55.891
Is this how you were holding it?

21:55.915 --> 21:57.092
Sideways, cracker.

21:57.116 --> 21:59.419
Damn it. I bet it
will still shoot.

22:00.887 --> 22:01.921
Crazy cracker.

22:03.690 --> 22:05.167
My face hurts.

22:05.191 --> 22:06.393
Mine too.

22:18.871 --> 22:19.915
Excuse me, young man.

22:19.939 --> 22:22.718
Give me that 'n' word's gun.
Okay, son?

22:22.742 --> 22:24.010
Afro-Americans?

23:01.581 --> 23:03.492
Jonsson. That's officer Johnson.

23:03.516 --> 23:06.862
Now, you could use
a stitch or two.

23:06.886 --> 23:09.331
Okay? Would you like me
to call you an ambulance?

23:09.355 --> 23:11.166
No. No? Okay.

23:11.190 --> 23:12.768
All right, time to
shove off, yeah?

23:12.792 --> 23:16.038
Aren't you guys gonna file a
police report or something?

23:16.062 --> 23:17.182
Are you gonna press charges?

23:18.230 --> 23:19.508
No.

23:19.532 --> 23:21.243
Then no. Okay.

23:21.267 --> 23:22.845
Will you guys sign my petition?

23:22.869 --> 23:24.813
Oh, no. We like the vikes.

23:24.837 --> 23:28.150
We like the vikes. Heck yeah, "go vikes".
You betcha.

23:28.174 --> 23:29.818
Get off my car. Okay. Bye.

23:29.842 --> 23:30.843
Yeah. Okay.

23:51.664 --> 23:54.534
Well, before you can be a nice
guy, you got to be a good bully.

23:55.301 --> 23:56.645
I don't wanna be a bully.

23:56.669 --> 23:58.413
Boo-hoo. Your mother didn't
want to take out the trash.

23:58.437 --> 24:00.916
But the kitchen would stink
to high heaven if she didn't.

24:00.940 --> 24:02.284
Ha! Good one, dad.

24:02.308 --> 24:03.852
Oh, jeez, oh, Pete... Guy.

24:03.876 --> 24:07.146
You yourself support the
anti-bullying movement.

26:36.562 --> 26:38.273
I want salt and nut rolls.

26:38.297 --> 26:39.298
It's you.

26:40.032 --> 26:41.143
I know.

26:41.167 --> 26:42.301
Mrs. Thovson: Thorvald?

26:42.902 --> 26:43.746
Yeah, mom?

26:43.770 --> 26:44.980
Mrs. Thovson: Ida's here.

26:45.004 --> 26:47.339
Yeah, yeah, I know. Thank you.

26:48.975 --> 26:50.042
Ouch.

26:50.843 --> 26:51.878
Yeah.

28:43.622 --> 28:48.170
No vikes! No vikes! No vikes!
No vikes!

28:48.194 --> 28:52.865
No vikes! No vikes! No vikes!
No vikes!

29:15.955 --> 29:17.299
Yeah, I have a hunch.

29:17.323 --> 29:18.566
Yeah?

29:18.590 --> 29:21.003
You know what he made in
his pants in first grade?

29:21.027 --> 29:23.105
Kind of gross. Yeah.

29:23.129 --> 29:25.607
And he just kept sitting in
his chair, wouldn't get up.

29:25.631 --> 29:26.809
And then finally, the teacher...

29:26.833 --> 29:27.910
Who, gaspar? Yeah.

29:27.934 --> 29:29.211
Oh, she's a strict one.

29:29.235 --> 29:30.946
Yes, so gaspar comes over
and makes him stand up,

29:30.970 --> 29:35.307
and when he does, a little pellet
drops out of his pant leg.

30:17.016 --> 30:19.251
Fell out of my leg,
rolled both of them.

30:22.588 --> 30:23.890
Ida: Bye.

30:25.791 --> 30:28.003
Come on, ida. We're going.

30:28.027 --> 30:30.329
No, I'll be home later.
I'll see you there.

31:00.059 --> 31:04.706
No vikes! No vikes! No vikes!
No vikes!

31:08.034 --> 31:09.945
That was a drill.

31:22.181 --> 31:23.916
We just got busted, huh.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.294
Yeah.

31:26.318 --> 31:27.429
Well, we are probably
in a good way.

31:27.453 --> 31:30.689
Yeah, yeah, we are
and that's the key.

31:40.632 --> 31:41.633
Bye.

31:42.801 --> 31:44.412
You made cards?

31:44.436 --> 31:46.481
Yeah. And a website.

31:46.505 --> 31:47.506
Check it.

32:06.925 --> 32:07.970
Equal pay for women.

32:07.994 --> 32:09.271
Ah, sure, yeah.

32:09.295 --> 32:11.339
You? Oh, no. I'm
good, thank you.

32:11.363 --> 32:13.708
You sure, you can always be
a better woman, you know.

32:13.732 --> 32:16.702
I hear ya, but I'm still working
on being a better person.

32:17.803 --> 32:19.105
Thank you. Bye.

32:20.206 --> 32:21.483
Should have had a card.

32:21.507 --> 32:23.109
Yeah, she should have.

32:24.376 --> 32:26.445
Why didn't you sign that one?

33:03.815 --> 33:05.060
Well how did you get here?

33:05.084 --> 33:06.285
To the mall, you know.

33:06.718 --> 33:09.221
I... I walked.

33:09.855 --> 33:11.223
Well?

33:13.325 --> 33:15.027
I'm sorry I made
you come get me.

34:16.722 --> 34:19.558
No. Thanks.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.006
I'm sorry.

35:32.030 --> 35:33.499
Ida: No, it's okay.

35:34.233 --> 35:35.434
Well, it's not.

36:39.531 --> 36:41.900
And la-li-dah-ing away
whenever they ask.

36:42.901 --> 36:44.236
You got to be militant.

36:44.736 --> 36:45.771
Stand your ground.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.775
It was some tasty lefse.

36:51.243 --> 36:52.578
What the hell that mean?

36:53.645 --> 36:58.025
Uh, lefse, it's this
Norwegian bread

36:58.049 --> 37:01.553
kind of like tortilla, I don't know.
Ida always makes it, little sweet.

37:19.405 --> 37:22.450
Joey's mom thinks it's
invisible Jimmy's fault.

37:22.474 --> 37:24.386
Invisible Jimmy's
invisible dad thinks

37:24.410 --> 37:25.587
it's Joey's fault.

37:25.611 --> 37:27.855
Either way, they're both out.
Here.

37:27.879 --> 37:29.815
"No vikes". Thank you.

37:31.182 --> 37:32.927
Swentek's folks blame you,

37:32.951 --> 37:37.122
but swentek says he's still in but
it will take two salt and nut rolls.

38:06.452 --> 38:08.696
I can't protest today, sugranis.

38:08.720 --> 38:09.721
I have to work.

38:10.055 --> 38:11.056
All right.

38:13.459 --> 38:16.938
No vikes! No vikes! No vikes!

38:16.962 --> 38:18.597
No... what? Oh!

38:22.801 --> 38:25.713
You can't break up with
me, you're not with me.

38:25.737 --> 38:28.182
Ida, I think you might be
reading into this more than

38:28.206 --> 38:29.775
than I've been
reading into this.

38:40.919 --> 38:42.196
Of the competition.

38:42.220 --> 38:45.467
There's proprietary information
back here, lad, criminy!

38:45.491 --> 38:47.402
They don't call it secret
sauce for nothing.

38:47.426 --> 38:50.271
And you, miss
corporate espionage.

38:50.295 --> 38:51.573
I know what you're up to.

38:51.597 --> 38:53.365
Chop, chop, let's go.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.778
Bye, thorvald.

38:56.802 --> 38:58.003
Come on, chop, chop.

38:59.471 --> 39:01.106
I leave you alone
for one second.

39:04.576 --> 39:05.944
Keith didn't even
know we changed.

39:26.398 --> 39:27.699
Oh, like you did?

39:28.534 --> 39:31.479
No, not saying that, but...

39:31.503 --> 39:33.038
I've had enough
that you can tell.

39:35.306 --> 39:36.642
I got this.

39:44.450 --> 39:45.493
Man: Hello.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.361
Hey, would you like
to sign our petition

39:47.385 --> 39:48.596
and change the name
for the vikings?

39:48.620 --> 39:50.422
Thanks, but no, thanks.

39:52.357 --> 39:53.692
We like vikes.

40:27.025 --> 40:28.503
You're not.

40:28.527 --> 40:31.463
No, I know, but I...
I feel like I am.

40:32.464 --> 40:34.900
I would know if you were
disrupting my life.

40:50.682 --> 40:51.717
Yeah.

40:52.718 --> 40:54.085
Isn't that why you're here?

40:56.788 --> 40:57.889
Well?

40:59.190 --> 41:00.502
Thanks.

41:00.526 --> 41:02.236
For what?

41:02.260 --> 41:05.997
Uh, for taking one for
the team for one.

41:44.202 --> 41:47.105
Okay? We got it from here on.

41:48.239 --> 41:49.507
No vikes, right?

41:51.042 --> 41:53.812
You can't just ditch
me, thorvald.

41:55.046 --> 41:56.090
Thorvald.

41:56.114 --> 41:57.115
Yeah.

41:58.183 --> 42:00.461
No more thankses.

42:00.485 --> 42:03.955
Uh, no, but that was a lot of
thankses right there, just now.

42:14.032 --> 42:15.200
He just ditched you.

42:24.109 --> 42:26.111
Hi, will you sign my
"no vikes" petition?

42:27.378 --> 42:28.647
Ida!

42:30.415 --> 42:31.750
Hi, Paula.

42:32.618 --> 42:35.096
Um, hey, babe.

42:35.120 --> 42:36.622
How's it going?

44:15.453 --> 44:16.998
Yeah, or sit him down.

44:17.022 --> 44:19.200
You have to let him
out to do that too.

44:19.224 --> 44:20.768
So? So?

44:20.792 --> 44:23.729
So it's a waste of time. Why don't
we save a step and drop him off now?

44:25.731 --> 44:27.065
Okay, get up.

44:44.783 --> 44:46.027
Hey, hey, hey.

44:46.051 --> 44:47.094
You said yes.

44:47.118 --> 44:49.687
Yes, I'm sure. No, I
don't need any help.

44:50.521 --> 44:51.790
Release the tricycle.

44:55.293 --> 44:57.395
Warren: Jeez, what do you
do for your grip, kid?

45:17.348 --> 45:18.525
Oh, hi.

45:18.549 --> 45:20.261
You wanted advice?

45:20.285 --> 45:21.820
You heard from manifestus?

45:23.154 --> 45:26.224
You know the little monkey inside
your head banging cymbals?

45:46.744 --> 45:47.955
All right. Now you remember

45:47.979 --> 45:50.557
we talked the other day
about the militant thing.

45:50.581 --> 45:52.059
Ah, stand my ground. Yeah.

45:52.083 --> 45:54.052
Well, maybe not so much of that.

45:54.685 --> 45:56.430
I mean forget about it.

45:56.454 --> 45:57.664
Are you stalking me?

45:57.688 --> 45:58.890
Yes.

45:59.891 --> 46:02.036
Cracker. Yeah?

46:02.060 --> 46:04.996
You don't care about the vikings
being called the vikings.

46:06.131 --> 46:07.408
Yeah, I do.

46:07.432 --> 46:08.976
Well no one else does.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.478
Are you saying Norwegians
aren't easily offended?

46:11.502 --> 46:14.882
No. I'm saying Norwegians
aren't a downtrodden people.

46:14.906 --> 46:17.051
But we can dog
pile the redskins?

46:17.075 --> 46:19.453
Are Indians a
downtrodden people?

46:19.477 --> 46:20.788
They have casinos.

46:20.812 --> 46:21.989
Casinos are good.

46:22.013 --> 46:24.491
Okay, first. It's
native Americans.

46:24.515 --> 46:28.854
And native Americans have been a
downtrodden people for generations.

46:29.754 --> 46:31.289
Isn't it called Indian gaming?

46:32.257 --> 46:33.334
Semantics.

46:33.358 --> 46:35.436
And what do you know
for Indians any how?

46:35.460 --> 46:38.029
Ah, kid got the tip of his
nose but not for one.

46:39.297 --> 46:40.341
One?

46:40.365 --> 46:41.542
Yeah, just one.

46:41.566 --> 46:42.567
One what?

46:43.434 --> 46:44.836
One little, two little?

46:45.536 --> 46:47.681
No. An Indian.

46:47.705 --> 46:50.517
One signifies the
object or thing.

46:50.541 --> 46:54.455
Yeah, it's just a word, right?
Not a thought or an idea.

46:54.479 --> 46:57.399
You know, we could just be giving a lot
of weight to a word if you ask me.

47:28.846 --> 47:30.057
Walking down the sidewalk,

47:30.081 --> 47:31.792
I'm faceplanted in the grass.

47:31.816 --> 47:33.260
You know black lives matter.

47:33.284 --> 47:35.229
I don't see all of you
messing with cracker.

47:35.253 --> 47:37.164
Well, he didn't run when
he was told to stop.

47:37.188 --> 47:38.765
Yeah, but I'm not
running now, am I?

47:38.789 --> 47:39.967
Officer jonsson:
Because you can't.

47:39.991 --> 47:41.792
Oh, because I can't. Duh.

47:57.508 --> 47:59.277
Ah... cousin.

48:00.511 --> 48:01.355
Huh?

48:01.379 --> 48:04.425
Yeah, my grandma is an "n" word.

48:04.449 --> 48:05.559
Tough.

48:05.583 --> 48:07.761
It's her word.

48:07.785 --> 48:09.897
That's right...
oh, oh, it's him.

48:09.921 --> 48:13.424
That young man, you know.
The guy... the kid.

48:14.492 --> 48:15.493
Yeah it is.

48:16.227 --> 48:17.738
You betcha.

48:17.762 --> 48:19.430
Him? What're you talking about?
Him who?

48:19.797 --> 48:21.342
I... cracker.

48:21.366 --> 48:22.309
Saltine-America.

48:22.333 --> 48:24.878
How the heck are you?
How's the cut?

48:24.902 --> 48:26.213
It's fine, yeah.

48:26.237 --> 48:27.305
Oh, okay.

48:27.939 --> 48:29.307
First world problem?

48:30.241 --> 48:31.442
It's a first world country.

48:35.413 --> 48:36.924
Jeez.

48:36.948 --> 48:38.383
You are a citizen.

48:38.683 --> 48:40.094
What?

48:40.118 --> 48:42.988
This here is manifestus devers.

49:57.595 --> 49:58.663
It's a cracker thing.

50:00.431 --> 50:01.775
Cracker?

50:01.799 --> 50:03.210
Of course, we got crackers.

50:03.234 --> 50:06.213
Hilda, can you fetch
some crackers

50:06.237 --> 50:07.581
for our guest here?

50:07.605 --> 50:08.673
Oh, yeah, yeah.

50:10.441 --> 50:11.742
Oh, thanks dad.

50:16.247 --> 50:17.582
Yeah, I recognize you.

50:19.184 --> 50:21.419
Here you go, some crackers.

50:22.387 --> 50:23.388
Thank you.

50:24.355 --> 50:26.567
Not like a good pot roast with Mrs.
Thovson.

50:26.591 --> 50:29.270
I got to tell you, yours is a
damn sight better than good.

50:29.294 --> 50:32.730
Oh, thank you very
much, manifestus.

51:38.629 --> 51:41.132
You know why stereotypes
exist, cracker?

51:42.900 --> 51:45.336
Uh... because of the man?

51:46.804 --> 51:48.105
Because of the who?

51:48.506 --> 51:49.607
The man.

51:50.408 --> 51:52.586
Look at you. The man.

51:52.610 --> 51:55.322
Stereotypes exist
because they are true.

51:55.346 --> 51:57.482
But there are exceptions
though, right?

51:58.983 --> 52:00.418
Be pretty boring
if there weren't.

52:01.686 --> 52:03.288
Is your job boring?

52:04.655 --> 52:06.457
Why do you ask me that?
Because I am black?

52:07.091 --> 52:08.526
You're black?

52:08.793 --> 52:09.827
Ah.

52:12.096 --> 52:15.476
I don't know. I guess it can be
pretty predictable from time to time.

52:15.500 --> 52:18.669
But I figure most jobs are little
boring sometimes though, right?

52:40.157 --> 52:42.102
Yeah, same name.

52:42.126 --> 52:45.272
Yeah, we also were
big readers, so...

52:45.296 --> 52:47.598
We have more than just
that in common, I guess.

52:48.766 --> 52:50.577
Expired in '82.

52:50.601 --> 52:53.738
Oh, no. He... He passed in '05.

52:54.639 --> 52:55.673
The card.

52:56.807 --> 52:58.343
Oh, yes, yeah. He...

53:00.845 --> 53:02.856
Hey, I'm really, I am glad
to have it back, thank you.

53:02.880 --> 53:05.783
Yeah, my cousin,
reciprocity, came across it.

53:06.917 --> 53:08.362
Reciprocity?

53:08.386 --> 53:11.389
Well, his aunt
spells it I-a-r-r-y.

53:12.657 --> 53:13.500
Oh.

53:13.524 --> 53:15.360
Pretty troubled kid
if you ask me.

53:16.126 --> 53:18.363
Well, he means well, right?

53:18.696 --> 53:19.764
No.

53:21.499 --> 53:22.700
Oh, cool.

53:25.202 --> 53:27.204
Hey, where is the...
Where is what?

53:31.108 --> 53:33.019
Nothing.

53:33.043 --> 53:36.823
Look. I've ripped people off,
and I've been ripped off.

53:36.847 --> 53:38.215
Neither one is a good feeling.

53:42.953 --> 53:44.789
Thanks.

54:06.143 --> 54:08.221
You're not afraid I
won't return it?

54:08.245 --> 54:09.514
Why wouldn't you?

54:12.350 --> 54:13.718
You're all right, cra...

54:14.419 --> 54:15.820
You're all right, kid.

54:17.822 --> 54:19.290
See you around. Yeah.

54:46.283 --> 54:47.594
Hey, tova.

54:47.618 --> 54:49.420
They fired you across
the way, yeah?

54:49.920 --> 54:52.457
Uh, yeah. Keith did.

54:53.824 --> 54:55.369
He's not so nice.

54:55.393 --> 54:56.437
Yeah, he's okay.

54:56.461 --> 54:58.429
I was kind of asking for it.

55:00.297 --> 55:02.500
Hey, thanks for
going back for us.

55:03.067 --> 55:04.402
Uh, yeah.

55:05.370 --> 55:06.604
Norwegians?

55:07.772 --> 55:09.640
Oh, yeah, sure.

55:10.641 --> 55:12.052
Who would have even thought that

55:12.076 --> 55:14.588
anyone would have thought
to stick up for Norwegians.

55:14.612 --> 55:16.357
Who even knows what
a Norwegian is.

55:16.381 --> 55:17.715
Aside from a Norwegian?

55:19.083 --> 55:22.052
Sounds like something you'd
find in your grocery's freezer.

55:40.237 --> 55:41.772
Uh, okay.

55:45.075 --> 55:46.544
Here you go.

55:48.779 --> 55:50.290
You know, I don't really care.

55:50.314 --> 55:51.749
You don't.

55:53.250 --> 55:55.486
No, but I like that you do.

55:57.287 --> 55:58.589
Oh.

56:00.691 --> 56:03.661
So, uh, going to turnabout?

56:05.029 --> 56:06.363
Uh, no.

56:07.832 --> 56:08.866
Do you want to?

56:09.700 --> 56:11.878
Okay. Cool.

56:11.902 --> 56:13.079
Cool.

56:13.103 --> 56:15.181
Cool.

56:15.205 --> 56:18.719
I'm going to go out on a limb
and say I'm a savage dancer.

56:21.546 --> 56:23.448
Savage. Savage.

56:25.816 --> 56:27.060
All right.

56:27.084 --> 56:28.695
So, I'll see you around.

56:28.719 --> 56:30.797
Uh, yeah, here. I'll see you.

56:30.821 --> 56:32.857
Yes. We work here. Yeah, yeah.

56:33.123 --> 56:34.459
Yes.

56:35.359 --> 56:36.861
Oh, so... yeah. All right.

56:37.928 --> 56:39.063
Bye.

56:49.239 --> 56:50.484
Homework?

56:50.508 --> 56:51.809
Yeah, jorgensen.

57:06.056 --> 57:07.768
And here you were not wanting
to get me in trouble.

57:07.792 --> 57:10.895
No, no. You didn't get me fired.

57:11.829 --> 57:13.774
But I can easily
believe I got fired.

57:13.798 --> 57:15.408
I mean even if kieth didn't,

57:15.432 --> 57:17.768
like want to can me,
he kinda had to.

58:02.346 --> 58:03.790
I suppose.

58:03.814 --> 58:06.016
Well, give me some stuff.

58:07.351 --> 58:08.394
Some stuff.

58:08.418 --> 58:09.796
Yeah, a thing.

58:09.820 --> 58:11.055
A thing.

58:16.594 --> 58:17.995
I dunno. I guess it's...

58:19.664 --> 58:21.407
Cool, when you can just...

58:21.431 --> 58:22.676
Hang out with someone

58:22.700 --> 58:24.778
you know, you could
be doing nothing.

58:24.802 --> 58:29.015
Even just sitting with a room...

58:29.039 --> 58:32.209
It's a cooler place because
you're both in it, you know.

58:34.411 --> 58:35.713
You ever get that feeling?

58:38.215 --> 58:40.585
I probably make no sense.

58:41.886 --> 58:42.953
Sorry, um...

58:44.054 --> 58:45.189
But yeah, that's...

58:45.990 --> 58:47.157
Some stuff.

58:47.858 --> 58:49.093
Yeah.

59:02.807 --> 59:04.985
Are you going to
turnabout, thorvald?

59:05.009 --> 59:08.088
Yeah. Are you?

59:08.112 --> 59:12.316
Oh no. Blaine's a senior. He's not
really into that turnabout stuff.

59:14.051 --> 59:16.153
Yeah. Yeah, I guess.

59:18.789 --> 59:21.267
I'm in Blaine's spot. Right.

59:21.291 --> 59:23.704
Um... I should, I should...

59:23.728 --> 59:25.730
Oh, no. It's no...

59:27.464 --> 59:29.209
It's everybody's spot.

59:29.233 --> 59:32.102
You're not going to lay in front of
the doors today, are you thorvald?

59:32.770 --> 59:33.771
No.

59:35.239 --> 59:36.340
Okay, then.

59:37.842 --> 59:40.353
He's not... Mad, is he?

59:40.377 --> 59:42.079
No, he would be counting.

59:53.023 --> 59:54.124
Well, bye.

59:59.664 --> 01:00:00.965
Bye, thorvald.

01:00:01.465 --> 01:00:03.443
What do you think?

01:00:03.467 --> 01:00:07.672
Uh, I think I shouldn't have
told you t-bone's wisecrack.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:01.852
Let's go.

01:02:11.796 --> 01:02:13.097
Can I help?

01:02:14.264 --> 01:02:15.399
Uh, yeah.

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:19.279
Say your name. Thorvald thovson.

01:02:19.303 --> 01:02:20.146
No, when they answer.

01:02:20.170 --> 01:02:22.406
Why? Because it's Norwegian.

01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:42.159
Less offensive.

01:02:44.361 --> 01:02:46.096
A lefse? Oh.

01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:48.165
Lefse.

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:52.803
Yeah. Oh... oh.

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:57.942
Mm.

01:02:58.876 --> 01:03:00.845
Delicious. Thank you.

01:03:01.879 --> 01:03:04.891
I actually have my potato mix

01:03:04.915 --> 01:03:08.328
in a stockpot in the
garage right now.

01:03:08.352 --> 01:03:09.429
Coincidence.

01:03:09.453 --> 01:03:13.800
Yeah. I put it in overnight to cool.
You know.

01:03:13.824 --> 01:03:16.336
Of course. And who has
room in the fridge?

01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.637
Yeah.

01:03:17.661 --> 01:03:20.264
Actually, I have some, uh,

01:03:21.431 --> 01:03:23.043
kringle in the icebox.

01:03:23.067 --> 01:03:24.845
Would you like to come in

01:03:24.869 --> 01:03:26.779
and help me whip that up?

01:03:26.803 --> 01:03:28.572
Yeah. Sure.

01:03:36.613 --> 01:03:39.149
Some folks call this kringla.

01:03:58.068 --> 01:03:59.603
My, you sure look it.

01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:03.183
Little round face.

01:04:03.207 --> 01:04:04.208
Friendly.

01:04:04.841 --> 01:04:06.452
Thanks.

01:04:06.476 --> 01:04:08.889
And you sure know your
way around the lefse.

01:04:08.913 --> 01:04:10.490
My mum taught me.

01:04:10.514 --> 01:04:12.883
Oh, is she Norwegian?

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:14.218
No.

01:06:02.926 --> 01:06:04.971
But strong...

01:06:04.995 --> 01:06:08.641
Catchy. Might have to answer
to peta on that though.

01:06:08.665 --> 01:06:11.277
Oh, no, no. We could name
them like the bullheads.

01:06:11.301 --> 01:06:15.381
Yeah. No, that's not a nice
thing to call a Norwegian.

01:06:15.405 --> 01:06:18.985
Uh, but we'd obviously
change the logo

01:06:19.009 --> 01:06:20.977
to a bullhead you know the fish,

01:06:39.129 --> 01:06:42.375
Uh, no. He actually
likes the vikings.

01:06:42.399 --> 01:06:43.743
Me too.

01:06:43.767 --> 01:06:45.511
Thanks for the snacks though.

01:06:45.535 --> 01:06:47.137
Oh, you're welcome.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:51.708
Oh, sit back down, ida.

01:06:53.943 --> 01:06:55.179
Here.

01:07:18.802 --> 01:07:20.070
I was born in Norway.

01:07:21.438 --> 01:07:23.049
Oh, really?

01:07:23.073 --> 01:07:24.717
You don't believe me?

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:26.819
Oh, no, no, no. I do, yes. I do.

01:07:26.843 --> 01:07:30.756
You don't really sound like
you're, you know, Norwegian, sir.

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:34.594
Well, my folks wouldn't let us speak
Norwegian around the house once we moved.

01:07:34.618 --> 01:07:35.561
Why not?

01:07:35.585 --> 01:07:38.622
Oh, we... figured we
were here now I suppose.

01:07:39.789 --> 01:07:41.801
Yeah, and what about your folks?

01:07:41.825 --> 01:07:43.969
No, no, no, not so much.
They, eh,

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:47.307
they, you know, they took to
learning the language too.

01:07:47.331 --> 01:07:49.109
After about a year or so,

01:07:49.133 --> 01:07:50.910
I recall my mom saying...

01:07:50.934 --> 01:07:52.145
She dreamt in english.

01:08:53.763 --> 01:08:54.798
Yeah.

01:08:59.935 --> 01:09:01.113
He was cute.

01:09:01.136 --> 01:09:03.506
Hm, yeah, I think he
felt the same of you.

01:09:06.075 --> 01:09:07.853
Are you going back?

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:08.912
Will you come protect me?

01:09:20.256 --> 01:09:21.867
Ida Esther.

01:09:21.890 --> 01:09:22.968
Warren turdslinger.

01:09:22.992 --> 01:09:24.203
Hey, fags. Thorvald: Hi.

01:09:24.228 --> 01:09:25.738
I'm not a fag.

01:09:25.761 --> 01:09:27.340
Well then, he is. He just
admitted it by saying, 'hi'.

01:09:27.363 --> 01:09:29.209
Is 'hi' a fag thing?

01:09:29.233 --> 01:09:30.267
Yeah, it is now.

01:10:06.636 --> 01:10:08.448
What did you guys just say?

01:10:08.472 --> 01:10:10.115
We said, "shut up, meatbag".

01:10:10.139 --> 01:10:11.751
Yeah, shut up, meatbag.

01:10:11.775 --> 01:10:13.486
Yeah, shut up, meatbag.

01:10:13.510 --> 01:10:15.812
Yeah I agree with those guys.
Shut up, meatbag.

01:10:17.281 --> 01:10:18.482
What's with you, kid?

01:10:19.349 --> 01:10:20.760
I don't know.

01:10:20.784 --> 01:10:22.784
Aren't you afraid you're
gonna get your ass kicked?

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:24.230
No.

01:10:24.254 --> 01:10:25.822
Oh, so you think you
can kick my ass?

01:10:26.055 --> 01:10:27.324
No.

01:10:28.057 --> 01:10:29.535
Can you believe this kid?

01:10:29.559 --> 01:10:31.337
You can give him a
thrashing, turdslinger,

01:10:31.361 --> 01:10:33.606
but you'd just be
beating up a sophmore.

01:10:33.630 --> 01:10:34.898
Big darn deal.

01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:13.045
I mean, how much fun are
you gonna have here?

01:11:13.069 --> 01:11:14.614
Yeah, come on. What're gonna do?

01:11:14.638 --> 01:11:16.081
Right, let's get out of here.

01:11:16.105 --> 01:11:17.883
Oh, wait. Sign our petition?

01:11:17.907 --> 01:11:19.184
No, sorry. No time.

01:11:19.208 --> 01:11:21.354
Well you know, you guys might have
little scandinavians one day.

01:11:21.378 --> 01:11:23.989
You don't want them to grow up in
a world of repression, do you?

01:11:24.013 --> 01:11:25.325
No. No.

01:11:25.349 --> 01:11:27.593
What're you moose doing?

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:29.018
We're from scandinavia.

01:11:30.587 --> 01:11:32.427
Warren: Blaine's gonna
hear about this, Esther.

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:06.656
You got those guys to sign.

01:12:07.290 --> 01:12:08.334
Yeah.

01:12:08.358 --> 01:12:09.469
How did you do that?

01:12:09.493 --> 01:12:10.570
I don't know.

01:12:10.594 --> 01:12:12.204
I think they just wanted to go.

01:12:12.228 --> 01:12:14.840
Yeah, I had turdslinger
on quite the run.

01:12:14.864 --> 01:12:15.932
Yeah, you did.

01:12:16.933 --> 01:12:18.344
I mean we were close

01:12:18.368 --> 01:12:20.646
to like a signature
once or twice.

01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:21.805
Yeah, we were.

01:12:22.772 --> 01:12:24.608
Folks really seem to
like the vikes though.

01:12:26.443 --> 01:12:27.977
Yeah, they do.

01:12:40.390 --> 01:12:41.634
Thanks.

01:12:41.658 --> 01:12:42.568
Yeah.

01:12:42.592 --> 01:12:44.561
Do you... Oh. Give me.

01:12:50.233 --> 01:12:51.276
Thorvald?

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.502
Yeah?

01:12:52.969 --> 01:12:54.003
Thor...

01:12:54.671 --> 01:12:55.915
Yeah.

01:12:58.408 --> 01:13:00.076
You kind of like the
vikes, don't you?

01:13:00.977 --> 01:13:02.579
People keep telling me that.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:19.796
Do you like the vikes, ida?

01:13:22.432 --> 01:13:23.900
I'm afraid so.

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:25.935
School.

01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:39.825
Tasty. Yum.

01:13:39.849 --> 01:13:42.662
I mean if you like, you know,
ever need any help with anything

01:13:42.686 --> 01:13:45.030
you want to get out, get heard,

01:13:45.054 --> 01:13:47.123
you know with the
redskins, just say it.

01:13:48.391 --> 01:13:49.869
Thank you.

01:13:49.893 --> 01:13:51.027
You bet.

01:13:53.930 --> 01:13:55.031
Hey, thorvald.

01:13:56.032 --> 01:13:57.133
Yeah?

01:13:58.868 --> 01:14:00.203
Why're you doing this stuff?

01:14:02.138 --> 01:14:03.172
What stuff?

01:14:28.197 --> 01:14:29.566
What?

01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.135
I took a break, thorvald.

01:14:33.402 --> 01:14:34.914
Really?

01:14:34.938 --> 01:14:37.774
Yeah. I just...

01:14:51.287 --> 01:14:52.756
Did you think I made this?

01:14:53.990 --> 01:14:56.993
I thought you contributed.
Or signed off.

01:14:57.426 --> 01:14:59.104
Really?

01:14:59.128 --> 01:15:02.241
Yeah, I mean the quality isn't
so consisting, you know.

01:15:02.265 --> 01:15:03.876
Like the design and finish.

01:15:03.900 --> 01:15:05.545
Mmm-hmm. It's not ida level.

01:15:05.569 --> 01:15:07.312
And what other tone?

01:15:07.336 --> 01:15:09.939
You know, it's not really
in your wheelhouse either.

01:15:26.289 --> 01:15:27.557
A polite lie.

01:15:31.661 --> 01:15:33.096
How was turnabout?

01:15:33.563 --> 01:15:34.998
Yeah, it was okay.

01:15:49.979 --> 01:15:52.281
Yeah. You would have had fun.

01:16:16.472 --> 01:16:18.107
How do you know I
would have had fun?

01:16:19.709 --> 01:16:21.911
Because you always
seem to have fun.

01:16:23.279 --> 01:16:24.580
Well, then I did.

01:16:26.783 --> 01:16:28.818
God damn, I just want
shit to go good for you.

01:16:32.155 --> 01:16:33.657
Sorry for swearing.

01:16:34.357 --> 01:16:35.701
Oh. No, why?

01:16:35.725 --> 01:16:37.336
Because I was taught not to.

01:16:37.360 --> 01:16:38.361
No...

01:16:40.664 --> 01:16:42.632
Why do you want stuff
to go good for me?

01:16:44.934 --> 01:16:46.269
I don't know. You just...

01:17:00.583 --> 01:17:04.087
Good damn, shit,
fuck, hell, ass...

01:17:07.657 --> 01:17:10.393
Dress for the position to
which you aspire, son.

01:17:49.766 --> 01:17:52.077
Ah, well, can I go
do my homework now?

01:17:52.101 --> 01:17:53.169
Yeah.

01:17:55.772 --> 01:17:58.350
Wait. Where's mom and my bro?

01:17:58.374 --> 01:18:01.144
They are at the church fair
visiting with the lord.

01:18:02.946 --> 01:18:04.256
Santa stayed home though.

01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.590
What can I do for you?

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:07.960
You know, I bet mom could kick
god's ass in a sack race.

01:18:07.984 --> 01:18:10.562
Oh, yeah. That's why she's
at the church fair.

01:18:10.586 --> 01:18:12.865
She never shies
from a challenge.

01:18:15.591 --> 01:18:19.095
Oh. I see you
brought a hot dish.

01:18:20.329 --> 01:18:21.707
No, it's lefse.

01:18:21.731 --> 01:18:24.200
Hey, great. You must be ida.

01:18:38.347 --> 01:18:41.660
Mmm. Good lefse.

01:18:41.684 --> 01:18:42.919
Oh, thanks.

01:18:45.354 --> 01:18:46.422
Oh, shucks.

01:19:12.115 --> 01:19:13.116
Thorvald?

01:19:15.151 --> 01:19:15.995
Yeah.

01:19:16.019 --> 01:19:17.930
This isn't your family.

01:19:17.954 --> 01:19:21.834
Yeah I know. They
came with the frame.

01:19:21.858 --> 01:19:23.738
They sure seem like nice
folks, don't you think?

01:19:31.134 --> 01:19:32.168
Thorvald.

01:19:54.323 --> 01:19:55.491
Where did you learn that?

01:19:56.392 --> 01:19:57.393
Still learning.

01:20:00.529 --> 01:20:01.865
So, what do you want to do now?

01:20:03.299 --> 01:20:04.810
I mean... nothing.

01:20:04.834 --> 01:20:06.335
It was pretty fun,
don't you think?

01:20:08.271 --> 01:20:09.581
Yeah.

01:20:09.605 --> 01:20:10.840
More nothing?

01:20:27.390 --> 01:20:28.733
No, they're not.

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:30.259
Well, they're not budging.

01:20:40.736 --> 01:20:44.040
These will come off a lot easier
if you lift your hips up a bit.

01:20:44.507 --> 01:20:45.574
I know.

01:20:46.242 --> 01:20:47.786
So?

01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:52.892
So... when I do, if I do...

01:20:52.916 --> 01:20:54.283
That will be the right time.

01:20:54.683 --> 01:20:55.727
What time?

01:20:55.751 --> 01:20:57.987
Hmm, some time. Maybe.

01:20:59.088 --> 01:21:01.991
Well, that will be
fun time too, I bet.

01:22:14.497 --> 01:22:15.664
That I like it a lot.

01:22:18.534 --> 01:22:21.337
Well... I had the urge.

01:22:32.982 --> 01:22:34.317
What are you doing?

01:22:35.251 --> 01:22:38.287
Suffering arthritis of the hand.

01:22:38.954 --> 01:22:40.099
A what?

01:22:40.123 --> 01:22:43.159
Homework. Aah... homework.

01:22:51.734 --> 01:22:54.113
Oh. Okay.

01:22:54.137 --> 01:22:56.715
Well, she can still have
snacks if she likes though.

01:22:56.739 --> 01:22:58.483
Uh, no, she can't.

01:22:58.507 --> 01:22:59.575
Well, sure she can.

01:23:00.843 --> 01:23:03.655
Uh, she's not really
feeling the urge.

01:23:03.679 --> 01:23:04.856
Yet.

01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:06.858
She's not feeling the urge yet.

01:23:06.882 --> 01:23:08.184
Oh.

01:23:10.019 --> 01:23:12.297
Thanks. Thanks though.

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:16.192
Okay. Well you know probably
best to save your appetite then.

01:23:17.060 --> 01:23:19.104
You know I'll just leave it here

01:23:19.128 --> 01:23:20.629
for when you're ready.
