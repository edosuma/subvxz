WEBVTT

03:48.640 --> 03:50.051
- Magnificent.
- Mmm-hmm.

03:50.920 --> 03:52.729
Looks fresh-forged.

03:52.800 --> 03:53.801
It is.

03:55.400 --> 03:59.041
No one's made a Valyrian steel sword
since the Doom of Valyria.

03:59.120 --> 04:02.761
There are three living smiths
who know how to rework Valyrian steel.

04:02.840 --> 04:05.366
The finest of them was in Volantis.

04:05.920 --> 04:08.321
Came here to King's
Landing at my invitation.

04:08.800 --> 04:10.529
Where did you get this much Valyrian steel?

04:10.760 --> 04:13.081
From someone who no longer had need of it.

04:16.360 --> 04:18.647
You've wanted one in the family
for a long time.

04:18.720 --> 04:20.642
- And now we have two.
- Two?

04:20.720 --> 04:25.044
The original weapon was absurdly large.
Plenty of steel for two swords.

04:25.560 --> 04:27.847
Well, thank you. It's glorious.

04:34.680 --> 04:36.364
You'll have to train your left hand.

04:36.600 --> 04:39.080
Any decent swordsman
knows how to use both hands.

04:39.160 --> 04:41.367
You'll never be as good.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.680
No.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.326
But as long as I'm better than
everyone else, it doesn't matter.

04:46.840 --> 04:49.446
You can't serve in the Kingsguard
with one hand.

04:49.520 --> 04:53.127
Where's that written? I can and I will.
The Kingsguard oath is for life.

04:53.200 --> 04:55.168
The war is over. The King is safe.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.004
The King is never safe.

04:57.080 --> 04:59.651
How many people in this city alone
would love to see his head on a pike?

04:59.880 --> 05:02.042
Other knights protected the King
while you were a prisoner.

05:02.120 --> 05:05.044
They will continue to do so
when you go home.

05:05.480 --> 05:06.481
Home?

05:06.640 --> 05:10.440
You'll return to Casterly Rock
and rule in my stead.

05:10.720 --> 05:12.722
You are the Lord of Casterly Rock.

05:14.880 --> 05:17.611
I am the King's Hand. My place is here.

05:17.960 --> 05:21.169
I don't expect to see the Rock again
before I die.

05:22.080 --> 05:24.321
You know what they call me?

05:24.400 --> 05:27.290
Kingslayer. Oathbreaker.
Man without honour.

05:28.000 --> 05:31.004
Now you want me to
break another sacred vow.

05:31.080 --> 05:32.889
You won't be breaking anything.

05:32.960 --> 05:36.089
There is a precedent
to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties.

05:36.160 --> 05:38.925
The King will exercise that prerogative.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.087
No.

05:40.720 --> 05:41.721
No?

05:42.440 --> 05:43.487
No.

05:45.440 --> 05:47.761
- I don't believe I asked you a question.
- There's my answer.

05:48.320 --> 05:49.810
If you think your bloody honour
comes before your...

05:49.880 --> 05:53.362
My bloody honour is beyond repair,
but my answer is still no.

05:53.440 --> 05:55.886
I don't want Casterly
Rock, a wife, children.

05:56.160 --> 05:57.161
What do you want?

05:59.600 --> 06:01.011
Supper would be nice.

06:02.880 --> 06:05.645
For 40 years I've tried to teach you.

06:05.760 --> 06:07.728
If you haven't learned
by now, you never will.

06:09.080 --> 06:10.127
Go.

06:10.200 --> 06:14.728
If serving as a glorified bodyguard
is the sum of your ambition, go serve.

06:15.960 --> 06:17.325
I suppose you want the sword back.

06:17.560 --> 06:18.641
Keep it.

06:19.640 --> 06:23.486
A one-handed man with no family
needs all the help he can get.

06:51.160 --> 06:53.288
How many Dornishmen
does it take to fuck a goat?

06:53.480 --> 06:54.481
Please don't.

06:56.640 --> 07:00.645
Seems to me the smart place to
meet travellers is in a tavern.

07:00.720 --> 07:04.930
That way, one party is late,
the other party can drink some ale inside.

07:05.000 --> 07:09.130
This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting
for, not one of your sellsword friends.

07:09.240 --> 07:13.211
If he's so damned important,
how come they sent you to meet him?

07:14.880 --> 07:18.726
There's bad blood between the Martells of
Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.245
Has been for years.

07:20.320 --> 07:24.370
And just in case the Martells of Dorne
are looking to spill some Lannister blood,

07:24.440 --> 07:26.363
- it may as well be yours, eh?
- No need for cynicism.

07:26.440 --> 07:28.283
I happen to be an accomplished diplomat.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.361
Oh.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.526
Ah, here we are.

07:35.800 --> 07:37.040
Can you read the sigils?

07:39.600 --> 07:40.647
Yellow balls?

07:40.720 --> 07:43.724
Wild lemons on a purple field,
House Dalt of Lemonwood.

07:45.400 --> 07:49.041
A vulture grasping a baby in its talons,
House of Blackmont.

07:49.520 --> 07:52.046
A crowned skull,
the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave.

07:52.120 --> 07:53.804
Boy knows his Dornish houses.

07:53.880 --> 07:55.041
I need a sigil.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.243
And House Martell,
a red sun pierced by a spear?

07:59.240 --> 08:00.287
I don't see it, my lord.

08:04.520 --> 08:07.888
Well met, my lords. His Grace King Joffrey
welcomes you in his name.

08:08.240 --> 08:11.289
My lord father, the King's Hand,
sends his greetings as well.

08:11.400 --> 08:14.882
I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock,
Master of Coin.

08:18.760 --> 08:20.410
Forgive me.

08:20.520 --> 08:22.522
I don't see Prince Doran in your company.

08:22.760 --> 08:26.446
The prince's health
forces him to remain at Sunspear.

08:27.240 --> 08:31.882
He sends his brother, Prince Oberyn,
to attend the royal wedding.

08:34.720 --> 08:38.327
The King will be delighted
to enjoy the company of a warrior

08:38.400 --> 08:41.609
as renowned as Prince Oberyn.

08:41.760 --> 08:42.885
Will he?

08:44.400 --> 08:45.765
Where is Prince Oberyn?

08:46.080 --> 08:47.286
Arrived before dawn.

08:48.080 --> 08:50.924
Not a man for welcome parties.

08:51.800 --> 08:55.771
Very well. My lords,
these fine men from the City Watch

08:55.840 --> 08:58.320
will escort you to your quarters
in the Red Keep.

08:58.600 --> 09:01.490
You must be weary after
such a long journey.

09:06.320 --> 09:09.130
Some accomplished diplomacy that was.

09:09.200 --> 09:10.201
Now where?

09:10.320 --> 09:14.370
We must find Prince Oberyn before
he kills somebody, or several somebodies.

09:14.440 --> 09:17.284
How do you plan on finding
a single Dornishman in a city this big?

09:17.360 --> 09:19.408
You're famous for fucking half of Westeros.

09:19.480 --> 09:22.404
You just arrived at the capital
after two weeks of bad road.

09:22.480 --> 09:23.720
Where would you go?

09:23.800 --> 09:26.929
I'd probably go to sleep,
but I'm getting old.

09:51.560 --> 09:53.164
Look at this one.

09:55.160 --> 09:56.889
How lovely is she?

09:56.960 --> 09:58.325
Beautiful.

09:59.080 --> 10:00.411
But pale.

10:00.720 --> 10:04.850
We like them pale in the capital.
Shows they don't work the fields.

10:07.520 --> 10:08.567
Do I frighten you?

10:11.600 --> 10:12.886
You like?

10:13.160 --> 10:15.811
Timid bores me.

10:16.600 --> 10:17.601
Hmm.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.561
You're a bit of mischief, aren't you?

10:27.240 --> 10:28.765
I think she likes you.

10:28.840 --> 10:29.841
She has good taste.

10:33.120 --> 10:35.168
You're not timid, are you?

10:38.880 --> 10:41.486
Not timid.

10:42.400 --> 10:43.970
Do you like women?

10:44.080 --> 10:45.320
When they look like her, my lord.

10:45.560 --> 10:47.688
This one will do nicely.

10:48.400 --> 10:49.890
Very good, my lady.

10:50.000 --> 10:52.002
Oh, I'm not a lady.

10:52.080 --> 10:54.287
A term of courtesy in this establishment.

10:54.360 --> 10:55.930
A lie anywhere.

10:56.800 --> 10:58.928
Why not use the right words?

10:59.000 --> 11:00.684
I'm a bastard.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.445
She is a whore. And you're what?

11:04.520 --> 11:05.931
A procurer.

11:06.640 --> 11:07.641
Any of the others?

11:09.800 --> 11:12.121
The two girls can leave.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.089
You stay.

11:15.400 --> 11:17.004
I'm afraid I'm not on offer, my lord.

11:17.080 --> 11:18.844
Everyone who works for Littlefinger
is on offer.

11:20.840 --> 11:23.207
Take off your clothes.
We'll be here a while.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.726
- My lord.
- I am a prince, boy.

11:27.720 --> 11:28.767
Have you ever been with a prince?

11:30.880 --> 11:32.041
Can't say I have.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.287
I'm wildly expensive.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.520
Take off your clothes.

11:49.200 --> 11:51.202
Which way do you like it?

11:52.360 --> 11:54.966
My way.

11:55.800 --> 12:00.010
And so he spoke, and so he spoke

12:00.080 --> 12:03.687
That Lord of Castamere

12:04.600 --> 12:05.601
But now the rains...

12:05.680 --> 12:06.727
Oberyn.

12:06.800 --> 12:07.847
Weep o'er his hall...

12:08.160 --> 12:09.366
Oberyn, don't.

12:09.600 --> 12:12.524
With no one there to hear

12:13.360 --> 12:17.968
Yes now the rains weep o'er his hall

12:18.400 --> 12:24.089
And not a soul to hear

12:32.320 --> 12:33.321
You lost, friend?

12:34.080 --> 12:36.003
Forgive me for staring.

12:37.160 --> 12:39.003
I don't see many Lannisters where I'm from.

12:40.320 --> 12:41.924
I don't see many Dornishmen in the capital.

12:42.000 --> 12:43.525
We don't like the smell.

12:45.480 --> 12:48.051
- Come with me, lover.
- Gods, look at this one.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.322
Sirs, if you follow me,
I'll arrange for a private room.

12:50.400 --> 12:52.687
Why are you wasting a woman like this
on a Dornishman?

12:52.840 --> 12:56.083
Bring him a shaved goat
and a bottle of olive oil.

12:57.880 --> 12:58.881
Hmm.

13:00.640 --> 13:03.769
Do you know why all the world
hates a Lannister?

13:08.880 --> 13:09.881
You think your gold

13:11.680 --> 13:15.685
and your lions and your gold lions
make you better than everyone.

13:18.400 --> 13:19.401
May I tell you a secret?

13:20.880 --> 13:22.882
You're not a golden lion.

13:24.280 --> 13:27.887
You're just a pink little man
who is far too slow on the draw.

13:37.480 --> 13:40.165
Longsword is a bad option
in close quarters.

13:40.840 --> 13:42.649
When I pull my blade,
your friend starts bleeding.

13:42.720 --> 13:45.166
Quite a lot, I'm afraid.
So many veins in the wrist.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.964
He'll live if you get
him help straightaway.

13:51.120 --> 13:53.771
So, decisions.

13:56.480 --> 13:58.721
Prince Oberyn, forgive the intrusion.
We heard there might be...

14:00.400 --> 14:01.765
...trouble.

14:03.480 --> 14:05.084
Apologies, my love.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.805
I'm here to welcome you to the capital.

14:18.120 --> 14:20.327
Ellaria Sand, my paramour.

14:21.880 --> 14:23.882
The King's own Uncle Imp.

14:23.960 --> 14:26.440
Tyrion, son of Tywin Lannister.

14:26.520 --> 14:28.727
If there's anything I can do
to make your stay at King's Landing...

14:28.800 --> 14:30.290
What are you? His hired killer?

14:30.800 --> 14:33.610
It started that way, aye. Now I'm a knight.

14:33.680 --> 14:35.011
How did that come to pass?

14:35.960 --> 14:37.121
Killed the right people.

14:41.720 --> 14:44.485
We'll need a few more girls. Girls, yes?

14:45.360 --> 14:46.566
You don't partake?

14:46.640 --> 14:48.290
Oh, I partook. Now I'm married.

14:49.520 --> 14:52.444
Prince Oberyn, a word in private?

14:57.360 --> 14:59.408
Seems I visited the Lannister brothel
by mistake.

14:59.480 --> 15:02.006
- Oh, they take all kinds.
- Even Dornishmen.

15:02.080 --> 15:05.482
The King is very grateful that you
travelled all this way for his wedding.

15:05.560 --> 15:08.564
Let us speak truth here.
Joffrey is insulted.

15:09.400 --> 15:11.721
I am only the second son.

15:11.800 --> 15:14.121
Well, speaking as a fellow second son,

15:14.200 --> 15:17.249
I have grown rather used
to being the family insult.

15:18.680 --> 15:20.762
Why did you come to King's Landing?

15:20.840 --> 15:22.171
I was invited to the royal wedding.

15:22.240 --> 15:24.561
I thought we were speaking truth.

15:26.080 --> 15:29.368
The last time I was in the capital
was many years ago.

15:29.440 --> 15:31.602
Another wedding.

15:31.680 --> 15:36.288
My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen,
the Last Dragon.

15:39.480 --> 15:42.609
My sister loved him. She bore his children.

15:43.480 --> 15:46.211
Swaddled them, rocked them,
fed them at her own breast.

15:46.280 --> 15:49.602
Elia wouldn't let the wet nurse touch them.

15:49.680 --> 15:53.651
And beautiful, noble Rhaegar Targaryen

15:53.720 --> 15:55.802
left her for another woman.

15:57.000 --> 16:00.083
That started a war,
and the war ended right here,

16:01.000 --> 16:02.843
when your father's army took the city.

16:03.360 --> 16:04.441
I wasn't actually present.

16:04.520 --> 16:06.727
They butchered those children.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.285
My nephew and niece.

16:10.760 --> 16:14.048
Carved them up
and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks.

16:16.720 --> 16:19.644
And my sister,
you know what they did to her?

16:23.160 --> 16:24.241
I'm asking you a question.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.124
- I've heard rumours.
- Hmm.

16:27.400 --> 16:28.731
So have I.

16:29.680 --> 16:33.002
The one I keep hearing
is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain

16:33.080 --> 16:37.324
raped Elia and split her in half
with his great sword.

16:37.520 --> 16:39.204
I wasn't there. I don't know what happened.

16:39.280 --> 16:43.080
If the Mountain killed my sister,
your father gave the order.

16:44.360 --> 16:46.442
Tell your father I'm here.

16:48.560 --> 16:52.770
And tell him the Lannisters
aren't the only ones who pay their debts.

18:14.560 --> 18:17.040
They're dragons, Khaleesi.

18:17.120 --> 18:19.851
They can never be tamed.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.922
Not even by their mother.

18:43.000 --> 18:44.047
Ser Barristan.

18:44.560 --> 18:45.925
Your Grace.

18:47.120 --> 18:48.406
Where's Daario Naharis?

18:49.000 --> 18:50.684
Where's Grey Worm?

18:52.280 --> 18:54.089
Gambling, Your Grace.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.246
Gambling?

19:19.760 --> 19:21.250
Mhysa. Mhysa.

19:31.600 --> 19:33.602
How long have they been at it?

19:33.680 --> 19:35.762
Since midnight, Your Grace.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.363
Ser Worm is stronger than he looks.

19:38.600 --> 19:40.090
But I can see his arms beginning to shake.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.727
What's the prize
to winning this stupid contest?

19:42.800 --> 19:44.882
The honour of riding by your side
on the road to Meereen.

19:45.120 --> 19:48.203
That honour goes to
Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan,

19:48.280 --> 19:50.726
as neither of them
kept me waiting this morning.

19:51.720 --> 19:55.202
You two will ride in the rear guard
and protect the livestock.

19:56.320 --> 20:00.325
The last man holding his sword
can find a new queen to fight for.

20:06.760 --> 20:07.807
You like this girl?

20:09.440 --> 20:10.601
Must be frustrating.

20:10.680 --> 20:13.365
You are not a smart man, Daario Naharis.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.763
I'd rather have no brains

20:16.480 --> 20:18.642
and two balls.

20:29.800 --> 20:31.802
You need to eat something.

20:35.160 --> 20:36.525
Pigeon pie.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.005
No, thank you.

20:43.040 --> 20:44.451
Lemon cakes?

20:45.560 --> 20:46.846
No, thank you.

20:46.920 --> 20:48.729
You love lemon cakes.

20:50.160 --> 20:51.605
Tell her she needs to eat.

20:51.680 --> 20:53.330
My lady, you do need to eat.

20:53.640 --> 20:55.051
I don't want to eat.

20:57.840 --> 21:00.002
If I could have a moment
alone with my wife.

21:09.840 --> 21:11.490
She needs to eat.

21:18.960 --> 21:20.246
I can't let you starve.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.850
I swore to protect you.

21:29.960 --> 21:31.200
My lady,

21:32.200 --> 21:34.043
I am your husband. Let me help you.

21:36.440 --> 21:38.283
How can you help me?

21:38.760 --> 21:40.888
I don't know, but I can try.

21:42.480 --> 21:46.485
I lie awake all night
staring at the canopy,

21:47.840 --> 21:49.683
thinking about how they died.

21:50.400 --> 21:53.085
I could get you essence of nightshade
to help you sleep.

21:53.440 --> 21:55.124
Do you know what they did to my brother?

21:57.240 --> 22:00.403
How they sewed his direwolf's head
onto his body?

22:02.320 --> 22:04.448
And my mother.

22:04.520 --> 22:08.969
They cut her throat to the bone
and threw her body in the river.

22:09.840 --> 22:13.049
What happened to your family
was a terrible crime.

22:14.080 --> 22:15.161
I didn't know your brother.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.288
He seemed like a good man,
but I didn't know him.

22:18.760 --> 22:21.969
Your mother, I admired her.

22:22.840 --> 22:26.049
She wanted to have me executed,
but I admired her.

22:28.360 --> 22:30.283
She was a strong woman.

22:31.520 --> 22:34.444
And she was fierce
when it came to protecting her children.

22:37.120 --> 22:38.485
Sansa.

22:41.680 --> 22:43.682
Your mother would want you to carry on.

22:43.760 --> 22:44.966
You know it's true.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.165
Will you pardon me, my lord?
I'd like to visit the godswood.

22:53.240 --> 22:56.562
Of course. Prayer can be helpful, I hear.

22:57.120 --> 22:58.281
I don't pray any more.

22:59.640 --> 23:03.281
It's the only place I can go
where people don't talk to me.

23:21.200 --> 23:22.281
My lion.

23:24.240 --> 23:26.004
What are you doing?

23:28.520 --> 23:30.409
What does it look like?

23:31.160 --> 23:32.207
Come here.

23:32.280 --> 23:34.760
How many times have I told you?
You can't visit me here.

23:34.840 --> 23:38.049
I know. We have come to a dangerous place.

23:39.160 --> 23:41.481
Have you forgotten me?
Do you know how long it's been?

23:41.560 --> 23:42.800
Of course I haven't forgotten.

23:43.240 --> 23:45.129
I want you.

23:45.440 --> 23:46.521
Don't you want me?

23:48.480 --> 23:50.642
Things are a bit tense right now.

23:50.720 --> 23:52.131
What things?

23:53.040 --> 23:55.247
My nephew the King wants to murder me.

23:55.320 --> 23:57.891
My wife hates me
because my father murdered her family.

23:57.960 --> 24:01.043
Oberyn Martell wants to murder
everyone whose last name is Lannister.

24:02.040 --> 24:05.362
You need to relax.

24:14.840 --> 24:16.251
Don't you want to relax?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.445
- What's wrong?
- I told you.

24:24.160 --> 24:25.969
- It's not a good time.
- It's never a good time.

24:27.120 --> 24:29.282
- You have your child bride now.
- Shae.

24:30.360 --> 24:31.327
Do you love her?

24:31.400 --> 24:35.883
Love her? I barely know her. She's a child.
She despises me.

24:35.960 --> 24:36.961
That's not an answer.

24:37.040 --> 24:38.451
I don't love her.

24:39.800 --> 24:41.802
You tried to ship me away.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.405
Ship you away?

24:45.120 --> 24:47.327
Give me diamonds and make me disappear.

24:47.400 --> 24:49.050
What are you talking about?

24:49.120 --> 24:50.929
If you want me to leave, just say it.

24:52.760 --> 24:53.921
- Say it!
- Shh.

24:55.080 --> 24:56.730
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:58.280 --> 24:59.406
You want me to stay?

25:27.920 --> 25:29.763
A work of art.

25:30.760 --> 25:32.524
The craftsmanship is excellent.

25:32.600 --> 25:35.251
You like it so much, you're welcome
to chop off your own hand and take it.

25:35.320 --> 25:36.321
You're such an ingrate.

25:36.400 --> 25:38.687
I spent days with the goldsmith
getting the details just right.

25:39.160 --> 25:40.161
Days?

25:41.240 --> 25:42.651
Better part of an afternoon.

25:43.240 --> 25:45.049
There, how does that feel?

25:45.480 --> 25:46.641
Uh...

25:48.200 --> 25:49.440
A hook would be more practical.

25:49.960 --> 25:51.007
Elegant, I think.

25:57.560 --> 25:59.005
Thank you for your help
with the other matter.

25:59.080 --> 26:00.809
- The symptoms have abated?
- Gone completely.

26:01.360 --> 26:02.805
I am in your debt, Maester Qyburn.

26:02.880 --> 26:06.646
Not a maester, Your Grace,
but happy to help whenever I can.

26:16.560 --> 26:18.483
- Odd little man.
- I've grown fond of him.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.489
He's quite talented.

26:21.600 --> 26:23.090
What symptoms?

26:24.000 --> 26:26.128
Symptoms that are not your concern.

26:26.200 --> 26:28.328
You let him touch you?

26:28.440 --> 26:30.408
You jealous?

26:30.480 --> 26:31.766
I'm surprised.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.251
You never let Pycelle near you.

26:33.520 --> 26:37.525
You think I'd let that old lecher
put his hands on me?

26:38.880 --> 26:40.484
He smells like a dead cat.

26:40.560 --> 26:42.961
I'm not sure I've ever smelled a dead cat.

26:43.080 --> 26:44.969
Well, they smell like Pycelle.

26:45.240 --> 26:46.241
You drink more than you used to.

26:48.240 --> 26:50.083
- Yes.
- Why?

26:50.160 --> 26:51.491
Hmm. Let's see.

26:51.680 --> 26:56.163
You started a brawl in the streets with
Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital.

26:56.240 --> 26:58.811
My husband died in a
tragic hunting accident.

26:58.880 --> 27:00.530
It must have been traumatic for you.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.045
My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne.

27:02.120 --> 27:03.451
We suffered through a siege.

27:03.520 --> 27:04.806
A rather short siege.

27:04.880 --> 27:07.645
That I didn't expect to survive.

27:07.720 --> 27:12.442
And now I'm marrying my eldest son
to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden,

27:12.520 --> 27:16.809
while I'm supposed to marry her brother,
a renowned pillow-biter. So...

27:16.880 --> 27:19.326
Father disowned me today.

27:19.400 --> 27:21.767
He can't disown you. You're all he's got.

27:21.840 --> 27:23.842
You're forgetting Tyrion.

27:24.560 --> 27:28.246
You don't really plan on staying
in the Kingsguard, do you?

27:32.080 --> 27:37.325
Staying in the Kingsguard means
I live right here in the Red Keep with you.

27:39.320 --> 27:41.004
- Not now.
- I want...

27:41.080 --> 27:44.084
Not now? When? I've been back for weeks.

27:48.440 --> 27:51.091
- Something's changed.
- Everything's changed.

27:51.760 --> 27:54.525
You come back after all this time
with no apologies and one hand

27:54.600 --> 27:56.568
and expect everything to be the same?

27:56.640 --> 27:57.766
What do you want me to apologise for?

27:57.840 --> 27:58.921
For leaving me.

27:59.080 --> 28:00.605
You think I wanted to be taken prisoner?

28:00.680 --> 28:02.569
Don't know what you wanted.
You weren't here.

28:02.920 --> 28:05.764
You left me alone.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.561
Every day I was a prisoner,
I plotted my escape.

28:08.640 --> 28:09.641
Every day.

28:09.920 --> 28:12.207
I murdered people
so I could be here with you.

28:12.280 --> 28:14.169
- You took too long.
- I...

28:16.280 --> 28:18.965
- What are you saying?
- You took too long.

28:20.120 --> 28:21.804
- Come in.
- Go away.

28:23.080 --> 28:24.969
Forgive me, Your Grace.

28:25.640 --> 28:28.405
You told me to come at once
if there was anything important.

28:48.200 --> 28:51.124
You plan on killing all the crows yourself?

28:52.800 --> 28:55.167
Do you plan on sitting here,
scratching your balls till winter?

28:56.000 --> 28:57.365
We wait for Mance's orders.

28:57.440 --> 28:59.408
You sent a man over the
Wall at the full moon.

28:59.720 --> 29:01.404
If he's not back yet, he's not coming back.

29:01.640 --> 29:02.846
And what is it you want?

29:03.360 --> 29:06.091
March on Castle Black with just this lot?

29:06.160 --> 29:08.481
Your pretty crow said
a thousand men are nesting there.

29:08.680 --> 29:10.125
He's a liar.

29:10.200 --> 29:11.361
He is?

29:12.360 --> 29:14.044
Shouldn't it be "he was"?

29:15.680 --> 29:17.011
You said you put three arrows in him.

29:17.080 --> 29:18.241
I did.

29:18.760 --> 29:22.367
I've seen you slip a shaft
through a rabbit's eye at 200 yards.

29:22.680 --> 29:25.365
If that boy's still walking,

29:25.440 --> 29:26.566
it's 'cause you let him go.

29:51.720 --> 29:52.926
Thenns.

29:54.360 --> 29:56.044
I fucking hate Thenns.

30:07.120 --> 30:08.360
Mance sent you?

30:08.720 --> 30:10.563
How did you find us?

30:15.560 --> 30:18.166
You came from the south, not the north.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.003
Took a detour.

30:21.080 --> 30:24.050
Got some supper
from a village down that way.

30:25.520 --> 30:29.127
Why does the meat down here
taste so much better

30:29.200 --> 30:31.168
than it does on our side of the Wall?

30:31.640 --> 30:33.005
Help yourself.

30:35.960 --> 30:39.169
Maybe everything's just
better fed down here.

30:39.240 --> 30:40.651
Fat and lazy.

30:42.760 --> 30:45.286
Easier for us.

30:47.160 --> 30:49.208
You didn't see us coming?

30:49.840 --> 30:51.410
Lost your warg?

30:53.600 --> 30:56.126
And that baby crow you had with you,

30:57.440 --> 30:58.885
lost him, too?

31:01.120 --> 31:02.963
I'll answer to Mance.

31:03.440 --> 31:05.090
I won't answer to you.

31:06.280 --> 31:07.611
She yours?

31:10.120 --> 31:11.804
I'm not anybody's.

31:21.440 --> 31:22.805
Too scrawny.

31:23.840 --> 31:26.491
Not like those crows at Castle Black.

31:27.400 --> 31:30.051
Think of them stuck in their larders,

31:30.720 --> 31:33.803
stuffing their faces
with ham and blood sausage

31:34.120 --> 31:38.842
and stew, getting nice and fat and marbled.

31:40.160 --> 31:43.004
I know we've had our differences, Tormund,

31:43.640 --> 31:47.167
but just one time before you die,

31:47.800 --> 31:51.009
you really ought to try crow.

31:54.120 --> 31:55.281
Draw.

31:56.160 --> 31:57.321
Loose.

32:04.800 --> 32:08.521
Last time I saw him,
he was in the courtyard at Winterfell.

32:10.880 --> 32:14.680
He said, "Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black."

32:18.360 --> 32:20.727
I was jealous of Robb my whole life.

32:22.560 --> 32:25.643
The way my father looked at him,
I wanted that.

32:27.000 --> 32:29.526
He was better than me at everything.

32:31.240 --> 32:33.720
Fighting and hunting

32:34.440 --> 32:35.805
and riding

32:37.040 --> 32:38.371
and girls.

32:38.880 --> 32:40.928
Gods, the girls loved him.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.211
I wanted to hate him, but I never could.

32:48.560 --> 32:50.767
Sometimes I want to hate you.

32:53.240 --> 32:56.244
You're better than me at everything.

32:58.880 --> 33:00.041
Except reading.

33:02.920 --> 33:04.285
They're, um...

33:05.240 --> 33:06.287
They're ready for you.

33:10.720 --> 33:13.326
He's wanted to hang me for a while.
Now's his chance.

33:13.400 --> 33:17.041
No one's going to hang you.
You've done nothing wrong.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.043
I've done plenty wrong.

33:20.240 --> 33:23.084
So you admit you murdered Qhorin Half hand?

33:24.240 --> 33:26.971
- I didn't murder him.
- No?

33:27.040 --> 33:30.044
You put your sword
through a brother of the Night's Watch.

33:30.120 --> 33:32.043
What do you call that?

33:32.520 --> 33:34.363
He wanted me to kill him.

33:34.440 --> 33:37.250
A bastard son of a traitor.
What would you expect?

33:37.640 --> 33:41.611
The Half hand believed our only chance to
stop Mance was to get a man inside his army.

33:41.880 --> 33:44.963
Don't talk about the Half hand
as if you knew him. He was my brother.

33:45.480 --> 33:47.801
Then you'd know he'd do anything
to defend the Wall.

33:48.040 --> 33:50.566
The free folk would have boiled him alive,
but letting me kill him...

33:50.640 --> 33:52.802
The free folk? Listen to him.

33:53.360 --> 33:55.169
He even talks like a wildling now.

33:55.240 --> 33:57.891
Aye, I talk like a wildling.
I ate with the wildlings.

33:57.960 --> 34:00.884
I climbed the Wall with the wildlings. I...

34:02.840 --> 34:04.001
I laid with a wildling girl.

34:06.960 --> 34:08.688
You admit to breaking your vows, then?

34:10.120 --> 34:11.121
I do.

34:12.080 --> 34:13.127
The law is the law.

34:13.880 --> 34:15.324
The boy must die.

34:15.400 --> 34:19.246
If we beheaded every ranger
who lay with a girl,

34:19.639 --> 34:22.849
the Wall would be manned by headless men.

34:23.120 --> 34:27.170
There's a difference between
sneaking off to the Mole's Town brothel

34:27.239 --> 34:29.368
and sleeping with the enemy.

34:30.199 --> 34:33.601
While we sit here
debating which rules I broke,

34:34.400 --> 34:37.404
Mance Rayder marches on the Wall
with an army of 100,000.

34:37.960 --> 34:39.405
Impossible.

34:39.480 --> 34:42.768
You can't get 50 wildlings together
before they start killing each other.

34:42.840 --> 34:44.045
100,000.

34:44.719 --> 34:47.882
He's united the Thenns, the Hornfoots,
the ice-river clans.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.291
He has giants fighting for him.

34:49.360 --> 34:50.600
Giants?

34:52.840 --> 34:54.808
Have you ever been beyond the Wall, ser?

34:54.880 --> 34:57.326
I commanded the City Watch
of King's Landing, boy.

34:57.400 --> 34:58.447
And now you're here.

34:58.520 --> 34:59.851
You must not have been
very good at your job.

35:00.240 --> 35:01.241
How dare you?

35:01.680 --> 35:06.129
There's a band of wildlings south of the
Wall already, led by Tormund Giantsbane.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.521
I killed their warg and three others.

35:08.600 --> 35:10.728
They shot me full of arrows.

35:11.680 --> 35:16.846
Their orders are to attack Castle Black from
the south when Mance hits it from the north.

35:16.920 --> 35:19.730
The signal for the attack
will be a bonfire.

35:19.800 --> 35:22.565
Mance said it would be the greatest fire
the North has ever seen.

35:23.440 --> 35:25.090
That's the truth.

35:25.600 --> 35:27.090
All the truth.

35:31.520 --> 35:34.967
Do you intend to execute me,
or am I free to go?

35:35.400 --> 35:37.402
None of us are free.

35:37.480 --> 35:39.164
We are men of the Night's Watch.

35:39.720 --> 35:43.441
But we won't be taking your head today,
Jon Snow.

35:43.840 --> 35:44.887
Go on.

35:56.200 --> 35:58.282
I am acting commander here, Maester Aemon.

35:58.680 --> 35:59.761
Yes, you are.

35:59.840 --> 36:02.081
And I don't trust the bastard.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.764
He told the truth.

36:05.120 --> 36:07.282
And you always know
when a man's telling a lie?

36:07.360 --> 36:10.091
How did you acquire this magical power?

36:11.880 --> 36:14.008
I grew up in King's Landing.

36:18.000 --> 36:19.843
No.

36:19.920 --> 36:21.968
You're a queen, not an ox.

36:23.320 --> 36:28.360
Your grandfather gave me a necklace
just like this one for my 51 st nameday.

36:31.200 --> 36:32.884
The wedding is in a fortnight, Grandmother.

36:33.000 --> 36:34.889
You can't say no to everything.

36:34.960 --> 36:37.201
Nonsense. My little dears,

36:37.720 --> 36:40.530
go and speak
to the jewellers of King's Landing.

36:40.920 --> 36:43.161
Tell them who you are, who sent you.

36:43.440 --> 36:47.968
The one who brings me the best necklace
will get to keep the next best.

36:52.400 --> 36:56.803
The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the Sept
a fortnight from now

36:56.880 --> 36:58.723
will inspire a thousand songs.

36:59.400 --> 37:02.085
How sad it will be
if she's wearing rubbish like that.

37:02.240 --> 37:05.323
Perhaps I should just let Joffrey
choose it for me.

37:05.400 --> 37:07.926
End up with a string of dead sparrow heads
around my neck.

37:08.000 --> 37:11.129
You watch that. Even here, with me.

37:14.120 --> 37:15.531
My word.

37:16.320 --> 37:18.084
My lady.

37:19.440 --> 37:21.602
Please pardon me for interrupting.

37:21.680 --> 37:23.091
My name is Brienne of Tarth.

37:23.160 --> 37:24.730
We know who you are.
We've heard all about you.

37:24.800 --> 37:27.201
But hearing is one thing.

37:27.680 --> 37:29.967
Aren't you just marvellous!

37:30.680 --> 37:33.047
Absolutely singular.

37:33.920 --> 37:38.608
I hear you knocked my grandson into the
dirt, like the silly little boy he is.

37:39.400 --> 37:43.291
My lady, I know this is a very busy time
for you, but if I could just have a moment.

37:45.720 --> 37:47.245
You dare not refuse.

37:50.280 --> 37:51.691
A shadow?

37:51.840 --> 37:54.764
With the face of Stannis Baratheon.

37:55.760 --> 37:59.321
I swear to you by all the
gods it was Stannis.

38:00.120 --> 38:03.841
He plunged his sword through Renly's heart
and disappeared.

38:05.400 --> 38:07.971
One day, I will avenge our king.

38:08.040 --> 38:10.042
Joffrey is our king now.

38:11.200 --> 38:14.090
- I meant no offence.
- And you've given none.

38:23.960 --> 38:25.769
All the Kingsguard will be on duty.

38:25.840 --> 38:27.763
Ser Boros will be stationed here.

38:27.840 --> 38:32.721
Ser Preston will be stationed here,
beside the primary entertainment.

38:34.720 --> 38:36.085
- Your Grace?
- Huh?

38:37.400 --> 38:40.768
One guard at the thing. Go on.

38:41.280 --> 38:44.284
Ser Meryn will guard
Lady Margaery and Tommen.

38:44.680 --> 38:49.129
I've always guarded the King himself,
my lord. Ever since your absence.

38:49.200 --> 38:50.690
And I thank you for it, Ser Meryn.

38:50.760 --> 38:53.604
All very good. I don't expect any trouble.

38:54.560 --> 38:57.325
The people love their King.
They know who keeps them fed.

38:57.400 --> 38:59.084
Margaery Tyrell, I've heard.

39:00.840 --> 39:02.251
By my leave.

39:02.560 --> 39:05.530
They know I saved the city. I won the war.

39:05.600 --> 39:07.443
The war's not won. Not while Stannis lives.

39:07.680 --> 39:09.921
I broke Stannis on the Blackwater.

39:10.440 --> 39:12.522
Pity you weren't there to help, Uncle.

39:12.600 --> 39:15.126
My apologies, Your Grace.
I was rather busy.

39:15.360 --> 39:17.249
Busy getting captured.

39:18.960 --> 39:21.645
So this is the famous Book of Brothers?

39:21.720 --> 39:24.849
All the great deeds
of all the great Kingsguard.

39:27.120 --> 39:30.408
Ser Arthur Dayne. The Sword of the Morning.

39:33.120 --> 39:35.361
Led the attack
on the Kingswood Brotherhood.

39:35.440 --> 39:37.886
Defeated the Smiling
Knight in single combat.

39:39.080 --> 39:40.650
Ser Duncan the Tall.

39:43.120 --> 39:45.327
Four pages.

39:45.400 --> 39:47.482
- He must have been quite a man.
- So they say.

39:51.280 --> 39:52.327
Ser Jaime Lannister.

39:52.960 --> 39:54.007
Hmm.

39:57.320 --> 40:00.005
Someone forgot to write down
all your great deeds.

40:00.480 --> 40:02.687
- There's still time.
- Is there?

40:03.320 --> 40:06.164
For a 40-year-old knight with one hand?

40:07.720 --> 40:09.768
How can you protect me with that?

40:09.840 --> 40:11.126
I use my left hand now, Your Grace.

40:11.840 --> 40:14.002
Makes for more of a contest.

40:31.400 --> 40:33.323
Have you ever been to Meereen?

40:33.400 --> 40:36.051
Several times, Your Grace,
with Master Kraznys.

40:36.160 --> 40:37.207
And?

40:37.560 --> 40:41.724
They say a thousand slaves died
building the Great Pyramid of Meereen.

40:41.800 --> 40:45.441
And now an army of former slaves
is marching to her gates.

40:46.880 --> 40:48.166
You think the Great Masters are worried?

40:48.800 --> 40:51.007
If they're smart, Your Grace.

40:54.920 --> 40:57.764
You were told to ride at
the back of the train.

40:57.840 --> 40:58.887
Yes, My Queen.

40:59.640 --> 41:02.803
But I need to speak to you
about something important.

41:02.880 --> 41:04.689
A matter of strategy.

41:08.880 --> 41:10.006
Your Grace.

41:14.240 --> 41:16.208
All right, what is this matter of strategy?

41:19.640 --> 41:21.085
A dusk rose.

41:21.520 --> 41:24.330
Would you like to walk at the back
of the train instead of riding?

41:24.400 --> 41:27.051
And this one's called lady's lace.

41:27.120 --> 41:29.566
Would you like to walk without shoes?

41:29.640 --> 41:31.244
You have to know a land to rule it.

41:31.440 --> 41:35.923
Its plants, its rivers,
its roads, its people.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.522
Dusk rose tea eases fever.

41:38.680 --> 41:40.284
Everyone in Meereen knows that.

41:40.360 --> 41:42.601
Especially the slaves
who have to make the tea.

41:42.920 --> 41:45.685
If you want them to follow you,
you have to become a part of their world.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.007
Strategy.

41:50.480 --> 41:52.448
Harpy's Gold.

41:52.520 --> 41:53.646
No tea from this one.

41:54.120 --> 41:56.088
Beautiful but poisonous.

42:02.920 --> 42:04.365
You are a gambler, aren't you?

42:12.440 --> 42:13.851
Your Grace.

42:46.280 --> 42:49.568
There's one on every mile marker
between here and Meereen.

42:49.640 --> 42:52.371
How many miles are there?

42:53.080 --> 42:55.208
163, Your Grace.

42:56.160 --> 42:58.003
I'll tell our men to ride ahead
and bury them.

42:58.440 --> 42:59.487
You don't need to see this.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.728
You will do no such thing.

43:02.840 --> 43:06.162
I will see each and every
one of their faces.

43:08.280 --> 43:10.931
Remove her collar before you bury her.

43:17.960 --> 43:19.689
There she is.

43:19.760 --> 43:21.524
Yes.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.602
- And?
- You made a promise.

43:26.520 --> 43:29.444
To return the Stark girls to their mother,
who is now dead.

43:29.520 --> 43:30.931
To keep them safe.

43:31.200 --> 43:34.283
Arya Stark hasn't been seen
since her father was killed.

43:34.360 --> 43:36.840
Where do you think she is?
My money's on dead.

43:37.240 --> 43:40.130
There's a certain safety in death,
wouldn't you say?

43:40.200 --> 43:42.885
And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister.

43:43.400 --> 43:44.481
Bit of a complication.

43:44.880 --> 43:46.928
A complication
does not release you from a vow.

43:47.000 --> 43:47.967
What do you want me to do?

43:48.040 --> 43:52.045
Kidnap my sister-in-law? And take her
where? Where would she be safer than here?

43:52.560 --> 43:56.042
Look me in the eye and tell me that
you think she'll be safe in King's Landing.

44:02.560 --> 44:05.484
Are you sure we're not related?

44:05.600 --> 44:06.647
Ever since I've returned,

44:06.720 --> 44:09.326
every Lannister I've seen
has been a miserable pain in my ass.

44:09.400 --> 44:10.401
Maybe you're a Lannister, too.

44:11.080 --> 44:13.401
You've got the hair for
it, if not the looks.

45:04.760 --> 45:07.764
It's all right.

45:11.200 --> 45:13.282
- You're drunk.
- Yes.

45:14.280 --> 45:16.726
I have good reason to be.

45:16.800 --> 45:19.610
Once I was a knight. Now I'm only a fool.

45:22.000 --> 45:23.650
Don't you know me?

45:26.520 --> 45:28.921
Ser Dontos. The King's nameday celebration.

45:29.480 --> 45:31.562
I'm sorry. I should have remembered.

45:31.880 --> 45:33.245
I can't accept your apology.

45:33.840 --> 45:37.128
I may be a fool,
but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.

45:38.160 --> 45:39.605
Anyone would have done the same.

45:40.440 --> 45:42.568
But only you did.

45:42.640 --> 45:45.291
I can never repay you. You gave me my life.

45:46.200 --> 45:50.489
But this is worth more than my life.

45:52.880 --> 45:55.645
It belonged to my mother,
and her mother before her.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.604
House Hollard was strong once.

45:58.680 --> 46:00.170
House on the rise.

46:01.000 --> 46:05.722
That's all that's left of those days,
thanks to a few sad, fat drunks like me.

46:07.200 --> 46:08.406
I can't take it.

46:09.000 --> 46:11.606
It's very kind of you, but I can't.

46:11.680 --> 46:13.682
I don't have anything else left.

46:14.720 --> 46:16.131
That's all.

46:16.520 --> 46:18.249
Take it. Wear it.

46:18.600 --> 46:20.921
Let my name
have one more moment in the sun

46:21.000 --> 46:22.729
before it disappears from the world.

46:27.720 --> 46:29.051
I'll wear it with pride, Ser Dontos.

46:30.800 --> 46:31.881
Yeah.

46:58.800 --> 47:00.165
When am I
going to get a horse of my own?

47:00.720 --> 47:02.961
The little lady wants a pony.

47:03.040 --> 47:05.247
The little lady wants
away from your stench.

47:05.880 --> 47:08.087
Horses aren't easy to come by.

47:08.400 --> 47:12.371
Even if they were, you think
I'm gonna put you on your own horse?

47:12.440 --> 47:16.684
Watch the only thing of value
I've got in the world ride away?

47:16.760 --> 47:18.524
Why don't you have any money?

47:18.720 --> 47:21.405
Didn't you steal anything from Joffrey
before you left?

47:21.480 --> 47:22.527
No.

47:23.280 --> 47:25.851
You're not very smart, are you?

47:25.920 --> 47:27.365
I'm not a thief.

47:27.440 --> 47:31.809
You're fine with murdering little boys,
but thieving is beneath you?

47:31.880 --> 47:33.609
A man's got to have a code.

47:34.120 --> 47:36.691
You think I'm gonna escape?

47:36.760 --> 47:38.683
Where would I go?

47:38.760 --> 47:43.209
I'd be dead by nightfall without you.
My family's gone. I've got no one.

47:44.040 --> 47:47.249
You've got an aunt in the Vale.
Your rich Aunt Lysa.

47:48.160 --> 47:49.844
After I sell you to her,

47:49.920 --> 47:54.323
maybe she'll have enough left over
to buy you that pony you want so much.

47:56.960 --> 47:59.361
I'm hungry. You're hungry.

48:00.080 --> 48:01.969
Five horses, five men.

48:02.800 --> 48:06.009
More than I feel like killing
on an empty stomach.

48:12.960 --> 48:13.961
I know him.

48:15.000 --> 48:17.321
The small one. His name is Polliver.

48:17.960 --> 48:20.247
He captured us and took us to Harrenhal.

48:22.760 --> 48:24.364
He killed Lommy.

48:25.040 --> 48:26.371
What the fuck's a Lommy?

48:26.640 --> 48:28.290
He was my friend.

48:29.320 --> 48:31.766
Polliver stole my sword
and put it right through his neck.

48:34.320 --> 48:35.446
He's still got it.

48:35.880 --> 48:37.166
Got what?

48:37.240 --> 48:39.083
My sword Needle.

48:39.240 --> 48:40.446
Needle?

48:41.160 --> 48:43.049
Of course you named your sword.

48:43.120 --> 48:44.326
Lots of people name their swords.

48:44.600 --> 48:46.090
Lots of cunts.

48:52.520 --> 48:53.931
What are you... Get back...

48:54.000 --> 48:56.287
My brother gave me that sword.

48:56.360 --> 48:58.203
- Get back here.
- He killed my friend.

48:58.880 --> 49:00.769
I don't care if he ate your friend.

49:00.840 --> 49:02.205
We're not going in there.

49:06.480 --> 49:08.960
Come on, give it up.

49:13.200 --> 49:15.441
Come here.

49:15.840 --> 49:18.320
- Let's have a feel, eh?
- Leave it.

49:47.560 --> 49:50.086
Come here.

49:51.600 --> 49:53.284
Please, she's a good girl.

49:53.360 --> 49:55.010
Shut your mouth and pour us more ale,

49:55.080 --> 49:58.687
and we may not take her with us
when we're done with her.

50:02.640 --> 50:04.051
I know you.

50:07.240 --> 50:08.526
You're the Hound.

50:10.920 --> 50:12.570
Pour our new friend some ale.

50:17.600 --> 50:19.364
What brings you so far north?

50:19.440 --> 50:22.171
I could ask the same of you.
What are you doing up here?

50:22.240 --> 50:23.810
Just keeping the King's peace.

50:23.880 --> 50:25.609
No need. The war's over.

50:25.800 --> 50:29.043
So I've heard.
Stannis defeated at the Blackwater.

50:29.120 --> 50:30.770
Robb Stark killed at the Twins.

50:30.880 --> 50:32.120
And where am I for all of it?

50:32.800 --> 50:34.768
Stuck with your brother.

50:34.840 --> 50:37.002
- Meaning no offence.
- None taken.

50:37.080 --> 50:40.050
He's good, the Mountain is.
Best at what he does.

50:40.120 --> 50:43.442
But torture, torture.

50:44.280 --> 50:46.487
You spend enough time
putting the hammer to people,

50:46.560 --> 50:49.404
you start to feel like a carpenter
making chairs.

50:49.560 --> 50:51.369
Drains the fun right out of it.

50:51.440 --> 50:52.680
And what's life without a little fun?

50:56.520 --> 50:58.204
But I don't need to tell you that, eh?

51:00.880 --> 51:03.087
She's all right. I've had better.

51:06.640 --> 51:08.165
You know what?

51:09.160 --> 51:11.128
You should come with us.

51:11.640 --> 51:14.484
His kind, they've always got
something hidden away somewhere.

51:14.840 --> 51:17.411
Gold, silver, more daughters.

51:17.560 --> 51:19.927
Always something
if you know how to make them talk.

51:20.000 --> 51:22.765
And there's plenty of him
between here and King's Landing.

51:22.840 --> 51:24.205
You could do well for yourself.

51:24.280 --> 51:26.169
We certainly have been.

51:29.760 --> 51:32.650
- I'm not going to King's Landing.
- Think about it.

51:32.720 --> 51:35.690
We could do whatever we like,
wherever we go.

51:37.440 --> 51:39.442
These are the King's colours.

51:39.520 --> 51:41.602
No one's standing in his way now.

51:41.680 --> 51:44.126
Which means no one's standing in ours.

51:46.280 --> 51:47.486
Fuck the King.

51:58.040 --> 52:01.931
When I heard that Joffrey's dog had tucked tail
and run from the Battle of the Blackwater,

52:02.320 --> 52:04.084
I didn't believe it.

52:04.400 --> 52:06.641
- But here you are.
- Here I am.

52:07.560 --> 52:09.483
Bring me one of those chickens.

52:09.560 --> 52:12.882
- You got money to pay for it?
- You paid for it?

52:13.040 --> 52:14.087
No.

52:14.680 --> 52:15.727
But we're the King's men.

52:17.080 --> 52:19.162
So, you got money?

52:19.880 --> 52:21.325
Not a penny.

52:22.000 --> 52:24.241
I'll still take that chicken.

52:24.640 --> 52:26.290
Tell you what.

52:26.360 --> 52:27.885
We'll trade you.

52:27.960 --> 52:30.327
One of our little chickens
for one of yours.

52:31.480 --> 52:33.050
Give us a go at your friend.

52:34.400 --> 52:36.926
Lowell there likes them a bit broken in.

52:44.360 --> 52:45.964
You're a talker.

52:47.760 --> 52:50.604
Listening makes me thirsty.

53:08.840 --> 53:10.251
And hungry.

53:11.040 --> 53:13.247
Think I'll take two chickens.

53:22.320 --> 53:24.482
You don't understand the situation.

53:25.160 --> 53:29.609
I understand that if any more words
come pouring out your cunt mouth,

53:30.440 --> 53:34.729
I'm gonna have to eat every fucking chicken
in this room.

53:34.800 --> 53:37.167
You lived your life for the King.

53:38.280 --> 53:39.964
You're gonna die for some chickens?

53:41.520 --> 53:42.931
Someone is.

55:40.880 --> 55:43.406
Something wrong with your leg, boy?

55:43.680 --> 55:45.603
What do you mean?

55:45.760 --> 55:48.445
Can you walk? I've got to carry you?

55:49.160 --> 55:50.286
Carry me?

55:53.000 --> 55:54.331
Fine little blade.

56:00.320 --> 56:02.129
Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
