Careful. He's badly wounded.

05:03.833 --> 05:04.833
Not wounded.

05:06.083 --> 05:07.500
Dying, Mother Eithné.

05:08.958 --> 05:12.333
-Who is he?
-An old friend. We must help him.

05:12.416 --> 05:13.833
Don't…

05:15.333 --> 05:16.833
waste your time…

05:20.291 --> 05:21.291
on me.

43:22.250 --> 43:24.541
I know you're there,

43:24.625 --> 43:28.333
and I know I'm not welcome.

43:30.333 --> 43:32.291
But my friend is here.

43:42.625 --> 43:44.166
Turn back now,

43:44.250 --> 43:46.083
or die in that field,

43:46.166 --> 43:47.583
ugly human.

43:48.875 --> 43:52.125
Sticks and stone may break my bones,

43:53.666 --> 43:57.083
but words will also… hurt me.

44:14.458 --> 44:16.500
Then I'll wait
for him to come out.
