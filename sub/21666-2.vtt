12:25.954 --> 12:27.740
Everything goes in a can.

12:29.166 --> 12:30.201
WOMAN: I gotta pee.

12:32.586 --> 12:34.417
Destry rides again?

12:37.341 --> 12:39.127
You guys did a good job tonight.

12:39.301 --> 12:41.963
We got a couple raids
coming up, bookstores.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.426
You in?

12:44.848 --> 12:46.304
You're in.

12:46.892 --> 12:49.929
CANDY: Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, no!

12:50.020 --> 12:52.636
Ma, this piece is missing
from this game.

12:52.731 --> 12:55.473
I told you, it doesn't work
without all the parts.

12:55.692 --> 12:57.148
You told me.

12:57.819 --> 13:01.357
What, you want me to run
right out to Macy's or something?

13:01.949 --> 13:03.655
No, I didn't say that.

13:04.242 --> 13:05.618
We still have that old game of yours.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.155
Mystery Date. Remember that one?

13:08.246 --> 13:09.281
What game?

13:09.373 --> 13:11.079
Your chance to meet
the man of your dreams.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.540
I'm sure we got
all the pieces to that one.

13:17.047 --> 13:18.287
You want me to dig it out?

13:20.467 --> 13:22.378
That's not a game for boys.

13:22.844 --> 13:25.130
Hey, let's play cards, okay?

13:25.222 --> 13:27.133
-You got a deck in your room?
-Mm-hmm.

13:33.605 --> 13:35.470
Now you're dead!

13:35.565 --> 13:37.066
BOBBY: I don't get it, Vince.

13:37.150 --> 13:38.981
Why would you quit Dominic's place
around the corner

13:39.069 --> 13:41.105
and go with a Chink
on the other side of the river?

13:41.196 --> 13:42.436
-Yeah.
-Because to Dom,

13:42.531 --> 13:44.146
I'm always just the fucking help.

13:44.241 --> 13:45.697
Kim, he don't know
what the fuck's going on,

13:45.784 --> 13:47.069
so I'm in charge.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.537
-It's like it's my own place.
-Yeah, except it ain't.

13:50.122 --> 13:51.111
Just saying.

13:51.206 --> 13:53.447
Plus, a lot of shit going on
across the river,

13:53.542 --> 13:57.706
Times Square, the action, tourists,
celebrities now and then.

13:57.796 --> 14:01.380
Jerry Van Dyke came into the bar
the other night, ordered a Mai Tai.

14:01.717 --> 14:03.127
Jerry?

14:03.218 --> 14:06.176
Yeah, Jerry Van Dyke.
My Mother the Car?

14:06.805 --> 14:08.341
Jerry Van Dyke.

14:08.432 --> 14:10.138
Shit, lwas in Di Fara's.

14:10.392 --> 14:12.553
Dick Van Dyke's
in front of me, ordering a slice.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.639
-Dick Van Dyke?
-Yeah, sausage and onion.

14:14.813 --> 14:17.304
The fuck you doing
jerking off Jerry Van Dyke

14:17.399 --> 14:18.764
on the wrong fucking side
of the river?

14:19.067 --> 14:21.729
Bullshit on Dick Van Dyke
eating pizza on Avenue J.

14:21.903 --> 14:25.066
Bullshit? Bull-fucking-true.
Sausage and onion.

14:25.407 --> 14:28.490
Looked he was about ready to sing
"Chim Chimney" any fucking second.

14:29.995 --> 14:31.110
Yeah.

14:32.330 --> 14:33.740
I'm doing something
at the Korean place

14:33.832 --> 14:35.618
to make me some real money.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.704
I pulled 700 on my take last weekend.

14:38.920 --> 14:40.876
Seven hundred? Shit,
I should be a barman.

14:40.964 --> 14:42.420
Yeah, you're doing fine where you are.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.418
-I heard you just made foreman.
-There's never enough.

14:44.760 --> 14:46.045
I got a lot of chicks in the nest.

14:47.304 --> 14:48.965
Well, try leaving
our sister alone for a minute.

14:49.056 --> 14:51.172
Yeah, or maybe putting
a condiment on it.

14:52.934 --> 14:54.390
What'd you do with the Chink bar?

14:59.232 --> 15:00.768
Dresses up the waitresses.

15:01.234 --> 15:02.223
-Yeah.
-Hey...

15:02.319 --> 15:05.982
They're wearing undenNear,
bending over, spilling on you.

15:06.073 --> 15:08.155
Not undenNear. Leotards.

15:10.327 --> 15:11.692
-Leotards, huh?
-Yeah.

15:12.704 --> 15:14.240
Girls look hot?

15:14.664 --> 15:18.452
Hey, Bobby, you would fuck me twice
to fuck them once.

15:21.046 --> 15:22.786
I think I might stop in this week.

15:23.298 --> 15:25.880
We're still working that site
over on 2nd not too far away.

15:25.967 --> 15:30.051
Hey, you're married with children
and lawn furniture, fucko.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.424
-You got a mortgage.
-It's okay to look.

15:32.516 --> 15:33.722
Just a venial sin.

15:33.850 --> 15:36.717
Fuck me, you just used
"venial" in a sentence?

15:40.941 --> 15:43.057
I'm not his mother. He needs you.

15:43.151 --> 15:44.937
I'm doing the best I can.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.865
I tell him you live in Washington,

15:51.952 --> 15:55.285
that you work for the government
and it's a secret what you do.

15:55.497 --> 15:57.579
It's good for him to think
you're doing something important.

15:57.666 --> 16:00.328
You know, next time you go
to the department store,

16:00.418 --> 16:02.545
buy him a game or something.

16:03.964 --> 16:06.751
They got one called Operation.

16:06.842 --> 16:08.457
You get to pretend you're a doctor.

16:08.552 --> 16:10.167
It buzzes. Kids really like it.

16:11.012 --> 16:13.173
Maybe that'll inspire him.

16:13.306 --> 16:14.807
He might grow up to be a doctor.

16:15.016 --> 16:17.223
Or a lawyer.

16:17.978 --> 16:19.468
Or whatever.

16:24.901 --> 16:26.482
I appreciate everything.

16:26.570 --> 16:29.607
Eileen, you take care of yourself.

16:37.038 --> 16:38.494
Vince.

16:38.999 --> 16:41.957
That guyjust tipped me 20
on a single 7 and 7.

16:42.544 --> 16:45.251
If I knew he'd like me that much,
I'd have given him a better pour.

16:45.630 --> 16:48.087
He doesn't like you, El.
He likes how you present.

16:48.258 --> 16:49.714
-(SCOFFS)
-Just saying.

16:54.181 --> 16:56.046
First round's on me, Vinnie.

16:56.391 --> 16:57.801
Hey.

17:00.228 --> 17:02.435
Fucking hot out there
in the sun today.

17:02.522 --> 17:04.604
-Well, it's cool in here.
-Yeah, I know.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.272
Even with all this
snatch walking around

17:06.359 --> 17:08.020
and air-conditioning in the bargain.

17:08.612 --> 17:09.601
You weren't kidding.

17:09.696 --> 17:11.607
This is something
you could raise my rent for.

17:11.698 --> 17:12.778
Don't get all worked up.

17:12.866 --> 17:14.697
There's a topless bar
out by the airport.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.115
-Them girls is whores.
-Yeah.

17:16.203 --> 17:17.989
These are waitresses
bringing me drinks.

17:18.079 --> 17:20.491
It's... I don't know, different.

17:20.582 --> 17:22.118
-Exactly.
-That's right.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.245
It's like, classy.

17:25.879 --> 17:26.914
Tommy Longo.

17:27.005 --> 17:28.916
-You know him?
-Longo?

17:29.007 --> 17:30.668
In the carting business.

17:30.759 --> 17:32.966
-What the hell's carting?
-Garbage trucks.

17:33.053 --> 17:35.385
He's got construction
contracts in the city.

17:35.472 --> 17:36.882
Our site, for one.

17:36.973 --> 17:38.588
Well, he's also a Shylock.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.556
Vinnie, you into Tommy Longo?

17:41.269 --> 17:43.180
-Guess again.
-Frankie, huh?

17:43.271 --> 17:44.431
Yeah.

17:45.023 --> 17:49.517
Well, pardon me while I go kiss
some familiar Italian ass.

17:49.611 --> 17:51.602
On your way back
cash this for me, will you?

17:52.656 --> 17:55.193
Why don't they just give it to you in
the morning so you can go to the bank?

17:55.283 --> 17:57.365
The bosses figure
if they pay us in the morning,

17:57.452 --> 17:59.784
we'll wander off the job site
and go get wrecked.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.821
And look, they're probably right.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.324
By the time we get checks,
there's no cash till Monday.

18:06.294 --> 18:08.250
How much payroll
do you got on the site?

18:08.338 --> 18:10.420
I got 82 grand in payroll right now.

18:10.507 --> 18:11.587
Sometimes more.

18:12.425 --> 18:14.131
Can you get us, too, Vince?

18:15.095 --> 18:16.756
Yeah, yeah, you're good.

18:16.846 --> 18:17.835
Me, too.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.137
-Just give me a second.
-Thanks, Vin.

18:35.156 --> 18:36.566
(GASPS)

18:37.242 --> 18:40.279
You did some drastic shit there,
I gotta say.

18:40.370 --> 18:42.201
Yeah?

18:42.289 --> 18:44.371
Minnesota ain't seen none of that?

18:46.584 --> 18:48.415
That thing you do,

18:48.503 --> 18:51.745
I don't think it's made it
west of Pittsburgh yet.

19:26.416 --> 19:27.906
Do you like this look?

19:28.710 --> 19:31.622
I could wear my hair
in a shag like that.

19:31.713 --> 19:34.204
You know, I bet I could do
what she does, too.

19:34.299 --> 19:36.711
I mean, I act every night, don't I?
I'm good at it.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.300
Baby, put that shit away.

19:39.721 --> 19:41.632
Jane Fonda ain't got nothing on you.

19:42.474 --> 19:44.760
I heard in that movie,
she ain't got no pimp.

19:48.188 --> 19:50.179
You know that's bullshit, right?

19:51.149 --> 19:54.812
It's fine for pretend,
but that won't work on the streets.

20:02.077 --> 20:05.114
Can I confide something in you?

20:05.205 --> 20:06.285
You know you can.

20:06.706 --> 20:08.697
I ain't never verbalized
this shit before

20:08.792 --> 20:10.623
to man nor beast, so...

20:14.798 --> 20:17.881
There ain't no individual
on Earth as alone as a pimp.

20:18.051 --> 20:21.134
You try to make a family
with your bitches, right?

20:21.221 --> 20:24.713
But after a while, most of them,
they just want you to fail.

20:26.810 --> 20:28.641
It's like a part of their nature.

20:29.270 --> 20:31.886
So you wind up having to play
all kinds of mind games

20:31.981 --> 20:34.518
to keep them all in line,
but nobody's fooling nobody.

20:34.609 --> 20:36.440
They want your ass to fail.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.852
The other pimps,

20:39.948 --> 20:43.941
it's "brother this, brother that,"
but at the end of the day,

20:44.119 --> 20:46.531
all they want to do
is shanghai your stable.

20:48.540 --> 20:52.374
The pigs, they want your money
and your scalp,

20:52.460 --> 20:56.044
and, God's truth, Lori, I'm...

20:56.464 --> 20:59.956
I'm just sick and tired
of the whole damn thing, you know?

21:00.218 --> 21:02.584
The whole dog-eat-dog mentality, it...

21:05.306 --> 21:07.262
You know,

21:07.350 --> 21:13.186
I've shown and proved myself out there
year in and year out, and right now,

21:13.273 --> 21:16.390
all I need is one good woman,
and I'm gone.

21:16.484 --> 21:17.860
Yeah.

You know what I'm saying?

21:29.080 --> 21:31.822
-I like that.
-You like that?

21:31.916 --> 21:33.326
Yeah.

21:33.751 --> 21:36.288
See, the thing is...

21:36.379 --> 21:38.916
I can't do none of that
until I make me a proper pile.

21:39.215 --> 21:43.584
And until then, I'm gonna be out there
like a warrior for my scratch.

21:43.678 --> 21:46.920
My chosen one will be
an Amazon out there for my scratch.

21:47.849 --> 21:49.259

You just concentrate
on the thing at hand.

22:50.411 --> 22:53.153
First thing after the money,
you check his johnson.

22:53.248 --> 22:54.784
That thing looks poxy, out he goes.

to tell me about dick drip?

with the side of their hands.

my mother used to say.

nothing else matters."

Crown Royal, if you please.

24:54.452 --> 24:56.864
-They'll be lining up every Friday.
-What's good?

24:56.954 --> 24:59.206
So as long as we have
the cash on hand, we're gonna do good.

24:59.290 --> 25:01.281
What the fuck?

25:03.836 --> 25:05.667
-Tommy fuckin' Longo...
-My twin brother, Frankie.

25:05.755 --> 25:06.961
That's the mock who starts all this.

25:07.048 --> 25:09.289
What is this,
The Patty Duke Show? Christ.

25:09.717 --> 25:11.253
Brother's an interesting character,

25:11.594 --> 25:13.676
not to mention, as we're all aware,
a fucking degenerate.

25:13.763 --> 25:14.752
Frankie's all right,

25:14.847 --> 25:17.759
he's just got a little problem
with the wagers is all.

25:18.393 --> 25:21.681
Anyway, that's the offer, Mr. Pipilo.

25:22.021 --> 25:26.640
Truth be told, we don't have the cash
to cover my brother's debt right now,

25:26.734 --> 25:29.726
but we're gonna get it
and deliver beyond what we owe.

25:29.821 --> 25:32.187
Tell me again
what we're talking about here.

25:32.281 --> 25:33.487
How many on the payroll?

25:33.574 --> 25:35.280
One-hundred forty, give or take.

25:35.535 --> 25:37.821
And I bet there isn't
a one of them who's happy.

25:37.912 --> 25:39.948
Right now, no one can take home money
at the end of the week.

25:40.039 --> 25:41.700
-They wait till Monday.
-I get it.

25:41.791 --> 25:42.951
You work in the office?

25:43.042 --> 25:46.955
I have access to the payroll lists,
if that's what you're asking.

25:47.755 --> 25:49.336
I know what
your brother-in-law gets me.

25:49.424 --> 25:50.413
Where do you figure in this?

25:51.801 --> 25:54.463
Well, Bobby's the inside guy.

25:54.554 --> 25:56.010
I'm the manager.

25:56.097 --> 26:00.591
It's what I do, this place,
every place I ever worked.

26:00.685 --> 26:05.429
I will make sure that every penny
is accounted for, Mr. Pipilo.

26:05.523 --> 26:06.854
It's a point of pride with me.

26:06.941 --> 26:08.522
I'm gonna hold you to that.

26:09.694 --> 26:11.480
Here's what I propose.

26:11.571 --> 26:13.812
Rudy Pipilo's gonna be the bank.

26:13.906 --> 26:17.069
The bank will take a 5% fee
out of every check.

26:17.201 --> 26:19.943
A guy opens his envelope
on Friday, he'll find cash.

26:20.079 --> 26:23.617
Also, lwant four
no-showjobs as well.

26:23.708 --> 26:25.323
Bonus for my time.

26:26.210 --> 26:27.245
Can you make that happen?

26:28.212 --> 26:31.079
I'm gonna give you guys
$1,000 a week, flat.

26:31.174 --> 26:32.960
That's for you and Bobby here,
for your time.

26:33.760 --> 26:36.001
As for your fuck-nuts
lookalike brother,

26:36.095 --> 26:37.255
he don't participate, understood?

26:37.346 --> 26:38.335
Understood.

26:38.431 --> 26:41.138
Any payoffs you gotta make,
any other expense,

26:41.225 --> 26:42.886
that comes out of your cut.

26:43.644 --> 26:46.056
No late payments, no shorts.

26:46.522 --> 26:49.480
-Understood?
-Understood.

26:51.861 --> 26:54.227
One more cocktail,
then you can walk me to my car.

26:54.572 --> 26:56.563
Okay, Mr. Pipilo.

26:57.909 --> 26:59.365
”Rudy-II

27:00.495 --> 27:01.655
Rudy.

27:01.913 --> 27:03.699
So, where you living, Vince?

27:03.790 --> 27:07.499
Got a room at the Lionel.
Convenient, like.

27:07.585 --> 27:09.667
I got my own bathroom.
I don't need much.

27:09.837 --> 27:11.577
Yeah, but this neighborhood?

27:12.840 --> 27:14.671
-Hey, Thunder.
-Vince.

27:16.427 --> 27:18.338
Punchboards come
into the bar all the time,

27:18.429 --> 27:20.135
sometimes with their pimps.

27:20.264 --> 27:22.095
But, hey, their money spends

27:22.183 --> 27:24.344
and, end of the day,
they gotta drink, too,

27:24.435 --> 27:25.845
-just like anyone.
-Stay close. Come on.

27:25.937 --> 27:28.474
Odds on, they're coming
from a matinee.

27:28.689 --> 27:31.305
Now, why should a man have to
walk through all this human garbage

27:31.400 --> 27:33.140
just to take his wife out on the town?

27:33.611 --> 27:35.852
All these properties
just sitting here, vacant.

27:35.947 --> 27:37.357
You think this area's ever gonna grow

27:37.448 --> 27:38.858
when you got this kind
of environment here?

27:39.742 --> 27:41.152
I don't know, Rudy.

27:41.244 --> 27:43.075
I just go to work every day,
make my nut.

27:43.162 --> 27:45.278
Yeah. Someone's gotta clean
this fucking place up.

27:45.373 --> 27:47.455
Until that happens,
ain't nothing gonna change.

27:47.542 --> 27:49.328
Yeah, it's like water
that kind ofjust sits there

27:49.418 --> 27:51.283
in a puddle, stays grimy.

27:51.420 --> 27:53.285
Standing water, right.

27:53.714 --> 27:55.124
It's stagnant around here.

27:55.216 --> 27:57.127
We gotta get the water moving again.

27:57.260 --> 27:59.000
What, you got some interest
down here or something?

27:59.095 --> 28:00.881
Some. I'm working on some.

28:01.097 --> 28:02.758
Here's my car. Vince...

28:03.349 --> 28:04.464
Make this right.

28:06.102 --> 28:07.638
See you, Vince.

28:12.525 --> 28:15.232
-Flapjacks for Miss Candy.
-Thank you, baby.

28:15.319 --> 28:16.934
You're welcome, darling.

28:17.029 --> 28:18.144
You know what I'm talking about.

28:18.239 --> 28:20.321
I had never seen such a tight series.

28:20.408 --> 28:21.523
Can I get a match, girl?

28:21.617 --> 28:23.118
I'm not your girl, bitch.

28:23.911 --> 28:25.447
Is that a no?

28:29.375 --> 28:32.333
LEON:
Help a brother out here, Dolores.

28:33.129 --> 28:35.916
I can't get no business
all crowded up with everyone else.

28:36.007 --> 28:38.089
Rochelle, we can't
just move seven blocks.

28:38.175 --> 28:39.585
That's the 18th Precinct.

28:39.677 --> 28:41.258
Cops don't know you up there.

28:41.429 --> 28:43.385
They'll pick you up as soon
as you set foot on the corner.

28:43.472 --> 28:45.428
A couple of trips
in the wagon, and we straight.

28:45.516 --> 28:47.472
-Know what I'm saying?
-Yeah?

28:47.977 --> 28:49.808
What about the trade
that's already up that way,

28:49.896 --> 28:52.228
you think those other macks
are just gonna let us move in?

28:52.356 --> 28:53.732
That gets us both cut.

28:53.816 --> 28:56.273
Richie, how about
you ball up sometime?

28:57.361 --> 28:59.226
Hey, my man, Richie, one question,

28:59.655 --> 29:01.987
you gonna throttle your bitch
or you want me to do it for you?

29:04.285 --> 29:05.616
Sunshine on my shoulders, Larry.

29:05.703 --> 29:06.738
It's all right,

29:06.829 --> 29:08.990
-but thank you.
-All right.

29:17.590 --> 29:19.546
Hey, mami, how you doing?

29:22.136 --> 29:24.468
-I'm good, Larry.
-Yeah, you good?

29:24.555 --> 29:25.886
I can look at you, tell you good.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.590
You know, it's dangerous out here
for a girl by herself.

29:30.227 --> 29:33.014
It's like walking a dog
through a minefield.

29:33.314 --> 29:35.100
You look like you need an escort.

29:35.191 --> 29:37.182
-I do?
-Yeah.

29:40.988 --> 29:42.273
"Rodney." Rodney.

29:42.365 --> 29:43.696
Look, Rodney cool.

29:43.783 --> 29:44.943
He cool.

29:45.034 --> 29:48.526
No, but he ain't got
no sensitivity to him, no intimacy.

29:48.621 --> 29:50.782
He ain't curious
about the human condition.

29:50.873 --> 29:52.864
I'm curious about
that shit all the day.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.951
-Excuse me, Miss Motherfucking Bitch.
-What?

29:57.213 --> 29:58.328
Can't you see I'm talking here?

29:58.422 --> 29:59.411
Answer me.

29:59.715 --> 30:01.091
Sorry.

30:03.302 --> 30:04.712
Damn.

30:07.264 --> 30:09.676
Like I was saying, Rodney ain't
got no sensitivity to him.

30:11.268 --> 30:14.635
Look, I don't do
the hard sell, all right?

30:15.064 --> 30:17.806
When the time comes,
and it will come...

30:20.277 --> 30:21.483
You know where to find me.

30:21.696 --> 30:22.981
That I do.

30:26.659 --> 30:28.524
Show some respect for the young ladies

30:28.619 --> 30:31.031

of business, hear?

I hear you, stretch.

Listen, I need a solid.

30:55.354 --> 30:56.969
It's just that...

30:57.773 --> 31:01.015
I'm supposed to shoot a blue tomorrow
up in the Bronx,

31:01.110 --> 31:03.192
but I have to be in court.

31:03.612 --> 31:05.989
-It's $75.
-Seventy-five?

31:07.324 --> 31:08.313
I can make that on the corner.

31:08.409 --> 31:10.274
The hell you need to go
all the way to the Bronx for?

31:10.369 --> 31:11.575
For me.

31:11.662 --> 31:13.402
I'm trying to get
my ass off the street.

31:13.497 --> 31:15.078
And if I totally hang this guy up,

31:15.166 --> 31:17.031
I'm person non gratis.

31:19.378 --> 31:20.879

always want to be in the movies?

31:36.729 --> 31:38.720
Seventy-five. ..

31:43.819 --> 31:45.525
For fuck's sake, say yes.

31:45.613 --> 31:48.104
Yes. I'll make a fucking movie.

-Larry, baby.
-Yeah.

31:52.870 --> 31:55.953
That movie you had me make
with thatjohn?

31:57.041 --> 31:58.451
I went to Mooney's.

31:58.626 --> 31:59.911
What, Fat Mooney?

32:02.880 --> 32:03.869
He's selling it?

32:07.176 --> 32:09.132
Just saying,
I don't think nobody paid us

32:09.220 --> 32:11.711
-except for that john.
-All right.

32:12.223 --> 32:13.679
I'm gonna look into it,

32:13.766 --> 32:15.552
make sure we ain't get
took advantage of.

32:15.726 --> 32:16.932
I'm on it.

32:17.019 --> 32:19.180
LEON: Plate's up, Maria. Plate's up.

32:20.731 --> 32:21.937
Okay.

32:24.235 --> 32:25.395
'Cause I don't think...

32:25.486 --> 32:26.646
I said I'm on it.

32:32.493 --> 32:34.358
Honestly...

32:34.453 --> 32:37.195
I don't see how you
could fail every class.

32:37.414 --> 32:40.121
I mean, literature?

32:40.209 --> 32:42.245
Abby, you love to read.

32:42.336 --> 32:44.827
You can reapply next fall.

32:44.922 --> 32:47.129
-If we write to...
-I'm staying.

32:47.341 --> 32:48.330
You're what?

32:49.176 --> 32:50.882
I'm not going back home.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.553
Your father's so upset
with you right now.

32:54.640 --> 32:55.675
He won't help you out.

32:55.891 --> 32:57.973
I'm not asking for his help.

32:58.602 --> 32:59.591
How are you going to live?

33:00.729 --> 33:03.015
I don't know, how does anyone live?

33:03.274 --> 33:04.263
I'll get a job.

33:10.197 --> 33:11.573
I'm sorry, Mom.

33:21.542 --> 33:23.157
I had a feeling.

33:37.683 --> 33:42.097
You need money or you get in trouble,
you come to me, understand?

33:53.157 --> 33:54.272
All right.

33:56.327 --> 33:58.067
-Hey.
-How you doing?

34:02.082 --> 34:03.868
-McNally.
-Hey.

34:05.252 --> 34:07.459
That's the second time
you've counted it.

34:07.546 --> 34:08.831
What the fuck?

34:08.923 --> 34:10.629
Yeah? Maybe I make it three.

34:10.716 --> 34:13.833
Tony, your gross was $360 with
all the differentials and overtime,

34:13.928 --> 34:16.715
less the 5% for cashing it,
and you're looking at $342.

34:16.805 --> 34:18.306
Then the taxes come out.

34:18.390 --> 34:21.052
$128, same as ever,
and you're looking at $214,

34:21.143 --> 34:22.428
which is what's in the envelope.

34:22.519 --> 34:23.850
Don't get your panties
in a twist, Bobby.

34:23.938 --> 34:25.929
This is my paycheck here.

Same as the other tower.

34:28.484 --> 34:31.396
Line goes slow 'cause they all
count it four times to make sure.

34:31.487 --> 34:32.567
Next week will be faster.

34:32.655 --> 34:35.397
Week after that, they'll just take
the envelopes and walk, you'll see.

34:36.116 --> 34:38.072
Get the make-work money for Rudy?

34:42.456 --> 34:43.616
See ya.

34:43.707 --> 34:45.663

-Quiet!

36:45.829 --> 36:47.694
No, the bar.

36:49.375 --> 36:52.208
Yeah, I heard of this place.
It's a fag joint, right?

get your opinion,

37:11.313 --> 37:13.520

of you know the business.

-No.

37:43.387 --> 37:45.503
-Mind if I ask you something?
-Sure.

37:45.597 --> 37:47.178
What's with this place?

37:47.266 --> 37:49.348
Deader than Bobby Kennedy in here.

37:50.602 --> 37:52.308
Well...

37:53.230 --> 37:55.721
These places are popular,
and then they're not, you know?

37:55.899 --> 37:57.605
Well, queer bars in the Village

37:57.693 --> 37:59.934
have been going strong
for years, no offense.

38:00.028 --> 38:02.280
Yeah, those places are safe, though.

38:02.364 --> 38:03.399
What do you mean?

38:05.451 --> 38:06.782
We got targeted.

38:09.872 --> 38:11.988
Somebody started
making calls to customers,

38:12.082 --> 38:13.913
picking on anybody
with a wedding ring on,

38:14.084 --> 38:17.702
you know, businessmen,
the suit-and-tie crowd.

38:18.547 --> 38:20.287
-Blackmail.
-Yeah.

38:20.466 --> 38:22.172
Once that happens, word gets around.

38:22.843 --> 38:23.832
Then it's over.

38:24.136 --> 38:25.421
So, what are you still doing here?

38:25.512 --> 38:27.218
I'm still being paid.

38:29.016 --> 38:30.552
What's that?

38:30.642 --> 38:31.757
Just taking count.

38:31.852 --> 38:33.388
You over-order liquor,
you're in trouble,

38:33.479 --> 38:36.266
so you gotta turn the inventory,
othenNise it's dead money.

38:38.400 --> 38:39.389
What's your name?

38:39.693 --> 38:40.682
Paul.

38:40.986 --> 38:42.271
Vincent.

38:42.362 --> 38:43.818
Hi, Vincent.

38:44.490 --> 38:46.651
-You guys find Tony?
-Yeah, he's back there.

38:46.742 --> 38:47.731
Drunk.

38:47.826 --> 38:49.327
Vince, you coming?

38:51.497 --> 38:52.953
See you, Paul.

39:02.674 --> 39:04.790
So, what do you think?

39:06.011 --> 39:07.592
You can't raise the dead.

39:07.930 --> 39:10.922
Yeah, but maybe you could
bring it back as something else.

39:11.016 --> 39:14.099
Me? No. I already manage a joint.

39:15.187 --> 39:17.644
And you really turned
that Chink dog palace around,

39:18.357 --> 39:20.222
which is why I'm offering you this.

39:20.526 --> 39:23.142
It would be yours. You own it.

39:24.696 --> 39:26.607
Why would you do that for me?

39:26.698 --> 39:28.359
Well, I'd have a small piece of it.

39:28.450 --> 39:30.691
Say 1,000 a week flat,

39:30.786 --> 39:33.118
and I get half the take
from the machines I put in there,

39:33.205 --> 39:35.161
but the business will be yours.

39:36.917 --> 39:38.157
Yeah, there's still a debt.

39:38.252 --> 39:40.163
I mean, nobody's gonna forgive that.

39:40.254 --> 39:42.461
A couple of Jews hold the notes

39:42.548 --> 39:44.504
and another guy over
at the Brill Building, too,

39:44.591 --> 39:46.297
but I'll work that out.

39:48.804 --> 39:51.341
You got a problem
with who I am, Vincent?

39:51.431 --> 39:55.595
Look... You own a business,
any business,

39:55.686 --> 39:57.642
you gotta pay the rent, right?

39:57.729 --> 40:00.892
Think of me as just
a regular landlord, that's all.

40:11.910 --> 40:14.367
They look like they're really fucking.

40:14.454 --> 40:15.830
Of course they are, baby.

40:15.914 --> 40:18.906
But you notice how they cut out
before he split it?

40:19.418 --> 40:21.409
That's 'cause you can't
be showing no penetration

40:21.503 --> 40:22.492
in a movie theater,

40:22.588 --> 40:26.297
because the cops would raid the shit
out of this motherfucker quick.

40:26.466 --> 40:30.550
You want to see that
or his jizz when he busts his nut,

40:30.637 --> 40:33.128
gotta go to one of them
brown paper-bag stores.

40:35.726 --> 40:37.557
Yeah, you could do that.

40:41.523 --> 40:43.514
Shit.

40:43.609 --> 40:46.476
I could act in a real movie
with a story and everything.

40:46.570 --> 40:48.856
Yeah, I know, baby, you a star.

40:55.579 --> 40:57.160
Check it out, Lori.

40:59.583 --> 41:03.576
It's like an oil patch, and those
sorry bitches are the derricks

41:03.670 --> 41:07.037
doing $5 and $10 slobberjobs
around the clock

41:07.132 --> 41:09.043
just to try to get
some fresh-off-the-dog,

41:09.134 --> 41:10.965
brogan-wearing popcorn pimp's nut.

41:11.178 --> 41:12.964
Now, lwant you to commit
this shit to memory.

41:13.055 --> 41:14.215
You know why?

41:14.806 --> 41:18.298
'Cause you ain't never gonna
see it or them again,

41:18.477 --> 41:20.968
not as long as we're good together.

41:21.813 --> 41:24.099
I have too much respect for
how hard my girls work for me

41:24.191 --> 41:25.772
to send them this a-ways.

41:29.780 --> 41:32.066
However,

41:32.157 --> 41:33.693
on the other hand,
should things go wrong,

41:33.784 --> 41:36.275
like you jumping ship 'cause
some Slick Willie motherfucker

41:36.370 --> 41:37.906
got inside your head...

41:40.332 --> 41:43.324
Shit, this could be like
the Ghost of Christmas Future.

41:45.087 --> 41:47.248
Every bitch up here,
one way or the other,

41:47.339 --> 41:48.328
has made that kind of mistake.

41:48.423 --> 41:49.754

all those fucking made guys.

41:59.601 --> 42:01.387

42:01.687 --> 42:04.679
He's a businessman.
Came at me straight.

42:04.773 --> 42:06.479
So if I'm gonna pay rent,

42:06.566 --> 42:08.557
-might as well be to him.
-I still don't get it.

42:08.652 --> 42:11.894
I mean, you drink for free,
you make good money,

42:11.988 --> 42:14.070
you got all the gash you can handle

42:14.157 --> 42:16.614

of owning a place.

-Why the fuck not?

C.C., please, get this man off of me.

52:02.161 --> 52:04.743
Now, you been through
some shit here this evening, no doubt.

52:04.914 --> 52:06.870
But the best thing for you right now?

52:06.958 --> 52:09.165
Just like falling off a bike,
you gotta get right back on.

52:13.840 --> 52:15.956
You happen to remember
where he put the cuff keys?

52:51.127 --> 52:52.913
Thanks a lot, sweetheart. For you.

52:53.004 --> 52:54.790
Thank you, baby.

53:07.226 --> 53:09.057
This seat taken?

53:09.145 --> 53:10.476
Go ahead.

53:21.491 --> 53:22.981
Let me buy you another drink.

53:23.076 --> 53:25.283
No, thanks. I'm good.

53:27.205 --> 53:29.241
You come in here
to take a load off your feet?

53:30.083 --> 53:32.916
Hey, I can dig it.
Iwork long hours, too.

53:34.003 --> 53:35.379
Look...

53:36.464 --> 53:37.624
I better get going.

53:37.924 --> 53:39.289
What's going on here?

53:40.760 --> 53:42.125
We're talking.

53:42.970 --> 53:46.383
I listen to people's stories
and put them down on paper.

53:46.516 --> 53:48.677
Sort of like an anthropologist.

53:50.228 --> 53:52.093
You've heard of oral histories?

53:55.983 --> 53:59.066
Larry, we was just
having a conversation.

53:59.612 --> 54:01.898
-I was just about to leave.
-Okay, okay.

54:01.989 --> 54:04.275
Well, conversations
don't pay my bills.

54:05.284 --> 54:07.275
Come on.

54:07.995 --> 54:09.860
Practicing anthropology...

54:12.875 --> 54:14.661
-Hey, hey, hey.
-Let go.

54:14.752 --> 54:17.209
What'd I tell you about
fucking with them jaspers?

54:18.965 --> 54:20.751
They don't spend.

54:23.052 --> 54:26.294
I want you to go out there
and you work it.

54:26.389 --> 54:28.004
-Okay?
-Yes, Larry.

54:28.099 --> 54:29.885
I'm gonna be by later to see you.

54:52.081 --> 54:56.324
I don't know what your game is,
but you stay away from my girls.

54:57.211 --> 54:58.621
You heard me?

55:38.711 --> 55:40.372
So, what are you doing tonight?
Are you dating?

55:40.463 --> 55:42.795
-Hey, you want a threesome?
-Hey, Ruby.

55:44.383 --> 55:45.793
Hi, baby.

55:51.724 --> 55:56.058
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

56:00.566 --> 56:01.851
On to fresher hell.

56:01.943 --> 56:04.059
On last night's stabbing homicide,

56:04.153 --> 56:06.144
found handcuffed in his car
by the Lionel Hotel,

56:06.239 --> 56:09.276
the vic, Rolfe Hermann,

56:09.367 --> 56:11.733
might have been
a master of moral degeneracy

56:11.827 --> 56:14.694
in our humble precinct,
but out in Great Neck,

56:14.789 --> 56:16.780
he was a beloved biology teacher.

56:16.916 --> 56:19.578
So, you hear anything out there...

56:19.669 --> 56:22.752
It was Colonel Mustard
in the pantry with a dildo.

56:22.964 --> 56:25.205
Moving right along,
strangulation homicide

56:25.299 --> 56:26.379
last night in The Cameo.

56:26.467 --> 56:27.582
Perp still at large.

56:27.802 --> 56:29.588
Three agg assaults. One in The Lark.

56:29.679 --> 56:31.544
-Perp still at large.
-Any descriptions?

56:33.724 --> 56:36.136
Another one inside Grant's Bar.

56:36.227 --> 56:38.263
Perp still at large.

56:38.354 --> 56:39.810
Two rapes.

56:40.064 --> 56:43.227
One complainant, known pross,
so who's to say?

56:43.317 --> 56:45.308
Commercial robberies. Holy shit.

56:45.403 --> 56:47.735
Fellas, watch the bodegas, all right?

56:47.822 --> 56:50.734
Gunpoint commercials
on the 100 block of East 3-0,

56:50.825 --> 56:52.440
the 300 block of the West 3-5,

56:52.535 --> 56:54.526
and the 200 block of the West 4-3.

56:54.620 --> 56:56.827
That was a cheap prick,
so who gives a flying fuck, right?

57:00.042 --> 57:02.829
Burgs are gonna take a while, so...

57:02.920 --> 57:06.003
Grab a cup of coffee
and put your feet up, okay?

57:06.424 --> 57:07.914
Our late tour creeper...

57:08.009 --> 57:09.840
Another day, another dollar.

57:09.927 --> 57:11.042
The 200 block...

57:11.262 --> 57:13.344
All right, ladies, show and prove.

57:15.850 --> 57:18.057
WOMAN: Come on, Flanagan.
I ain't working.

57:18.144 --> 57:20.009
I'm just going for an Orange Julius.

57:20.396 --> 57:21.886
Show and prove.

57:22.189 --> 57:23.804
Get in the van, Ash.

57:23.899 --> 57:27.141
The hoes go in, the hoes go out.

57:27.236 --> 57:28.396
Now this motherfucker.

57:28.487 --> 57:30.569
Like sweeping leaves on a windy day.

57:30.656 --> 57:32.362
Ain't that right, Officers?

57:32.908 --> 57:35.900
Solid bullshit.

57:35.995 --> 57:37.986
Everybody goes tonight.

57:38.080 --> 57:39.581
-Come on.
-What?

57:40.583 --> 57:42.073
Let's go.

57:42.168 --> 57:43.533
WOMAN: Asshole.

57:43.711 --> 57:44.951
RODNEY: That's some bullshit, Alston.
