00:01.734 --> 00:03.735
Dr. Reid, I know yoga is
supposed to be good

00:03.735 --> 00:06.514
For pregnant women,
but are you sure this is okay?

00:06.514 --> 00:09.289
It looks like that baby
could squirt out any second.

00:09.289 --> 00:10.742
Lucy, I'm fine.

00:10.743 --> 00:13.078
Beside I would never
give birth under a tree.

00:13.279 --> 00:16.047
Although j.D. And I did
conceive this baby under one.

00:16.248 --> 00:18.650
It was a christmas tree--
not in our house.

00:18.650 --> 00:19.301
It was still on the lot.

00:19.801 --> 00:24.589
We made a bunch of christians unmfortable that day.
I once got felt up in a pumpkin patch.

00:25.090 --> 00:29.639
Don't you just love the holidays?
It's so nice having someone to talk to.

00:30.019 --> 00:32.127
I feel like I can't go
to the other med students.

00:32.127 --> 00:33.762
It's gotten so cutthroat.

00:33.762 --> 00:35.418
People will do anything
to get ahead.

00:36.366 --> 00:37.510
(typing on keyboard)

00:37.770 --> 00:40.905
"lost" got canceled, and they're
never gonna air the finale?

00:40.906 --> 00:43.808
So many questions!
Hey, good luck on the test, bro.

00:46.575 --> 00:49.005
<i>(lucy) even drew's been acting
like a gunner recently.</i>

00:49.751 --> 00:52.520
Drew, can I borrow
your histology notes?

00:52.755 --> 00:55.576
Roger, no. Nothing personal.
I just don't want

00:55.576 --> 00:57.357
To help you half-ass your way
through med school

00:57.657 --> 00:59.122
And keep you
from yr true destiny,

00:59.122 --> 01:00.933
Which is to become
the second-best dentist

01:00.933 --> 01:03.664
At a run-down strip mall.
You get it.

01:05.670 --> 01:07.874
I was a gunner for a while
when I was in med school.

01:08.602 --> 01:10.257
Once I set my roommate lauren's
books on fire

01:10.257 --> 01:12.701
So she couldn't study.
Turns out I'd loaned her mine,

01:12.701 --> 01:14.764
So I actually had to buy a whole
new set which she then stole.

01:15.064 --> 01:17.548
Still, in the end, I won
because she got hit by a truck.

01:18.360 --> 01:19.786
I mean, she didn't die,

01:19.786 --> 01:23.949
But she's not smart enough to be a doctor anymore.
Is she happy?

01:24.914 --> 01:26.711
Oh, she's very happy.
Good.

01:28.895 --> 01:31.656
Now to recap, what is
the number one attribute

01:31.656 --> 01:34.672
All med students share
with this skeleton?

01:35.134 --> 01:36.272
Ooh.
Yes?

01:36.472 --> 01:39.524
The hollow area of nothingness
inside the skull?

01:39.724 --> 01:42.772
Exactly. Now it is time
for a bong announcement

01:42.772 --> 01:44.383
About a pointless tradition
brought to you

01:44.383 --> 01:46.583
By an empty figurehead
with a failing liver

01:46.583 --> 01:48.628
And an overactive libido...
Mm!

01:48.628 --> 01:51.542
Thank you, perry,
you anger-filled muscle slut.

01:51.742 --> 01:53.196
I miss... This.

01:53.396 --> 01:56.148
Yeah, me, too. It kills me
that we're friends now.

01:56.348 --> 01:57.777
All right, as you know,

01:57.777 --> 02:00.679
Friday is the annual
white coat ceremony.

02:00.879 --> 02:02.581
In front of your family
and friends,

02:02.581 --> 02:04.472
You will receive
your lab coats--

02:04.572 --> 02:07.868
A symbol of your entrÃ©e
into the world of medicine.

02:08.068 --> 02:09.627
These doctors' coats--

02:09.627 --> 02:13.189
Murderers' coats, bob--
because they are all murderers.

02:13.915 --> 02:17.670
Anywho, the faculty will
be choosing a keynote speaker

02:17.670 --> 02:19.916
To represent
the entire first year class.

02:19.916 --> 02:21.850
And as part
of this meaningless charade,

02:21.850 --> 02:24.517
Winston university requires
that each of you sit with me,

02:24.517 --> 02:25.534
The chief of medicine,

02:25.534 --> 02:29.890
For an irrelevant preceremony interview.
A quick sidebar, perry.

02:29.890 --> 02:32.351
(lowers voice)
can I do the interview

02:32.351 --> 02:34.218
With that little number
in the second row?

02:34.957 --> 02:37.236
She said I reminded her
of her grandpa,

02:37.236 --> 02:40.232
And I think I could use that
to at least get her top off.

02:40.232 --> 02:42.444
You're a hell of an educor,
of her g bob.A,

02:42.444 --> 02:43.560
I do it for them.

02:47.580 --> 02:49.944
So you, uh, are you ready
for your interview?

02:50.426 --> 02:53.472
So ready. I can answer
any questions about our classes,

02:53.472 --> 02:56.014
About the hospital--I even
took the time to memorize

02:56.014 --> 02:58.185
Personal facts about
each of my professors.

02:58.185 --> 02:59.514
So bring it.

02:59.987 --> 03:01.509
Well, there's really
only one question.

03:02.404 --> 03:03.652
Why do you wantto be a doctor?

03:04.824 --> 03:06.119
You've never been to maine,

03:06.119 --> 03:08.140
And you were college roommates
with michael bolton.

03:08.792 --> 03:12.021
Yes, and the latter
fuels most of my anger.

03:12.813 --> 03:14.560
I'd like you to come back
with a better answer,

03:14.640 --> 03:16.510
And if you find you can't
come up with a better answer,

03:16.510 --> 03:18.793
Then please know I'm going to
make it my personal mission

03:18.793 --> 03:23.657
To drum you out of this med school.
But you said this was just a meaningless charade.

03:23.657 --> 03:26.267
Not for you. Get out.

03:26.912 --> 03:28.469
(whispers)
stupid michael bolton.

03:32.161 --> 03:33.744
Hey, buddy.
Not your buddy.

03:33.744 --> 03:35.878
Whatevs, bro.
Also not your bro.

03:35.878 --> 03:38.435
Mmm. Once again,
it's you versus me--

03:38.435 --> 03:41.336
Smarts versus nepotism
for the keynote speaker.

03:41.536 --> 03:42.785
Let the battle begin.

03:43.852 --> 03:46.189
There's no battle.
This is something I want,

03:46.189 --> 03:49.420
So I'm gonna crush you.
Yeah, well, good luck, 'cause I got skills.

03:49.520 --> 03:50.396
Check it.

03:52.890 --> 03:53.983
Swish.

03:56.965 --> 03:58.952
Hey, drew.
You know how we get hot

03:58.952 --> 04:03.211
Over gross and disgusting things?
Yes, and hello, dr. Reid, who I barely know.

04:03.411 --> 04:05.156
'sup, freak?
Hi.

04:05.156 --> 04:06.343
Anyway, check it out.

04:06.543 --> 04:09.797
Mr. Warshal passed his kidney stone.
Oh, that's hot.

04:10.097 --> 04:12.864
F.Y.I., that's like passing
a bowling ball through a straw.

04:12.864 --> 04:14.558
They say it's actually
a lot like giving birth.

04:14.558 --> 04:17.228
Super pumped, by the way.
Super pumped.

04:18.418 --> 04:19.702
So I'm taking you
to dinner tonight.

04:19.702 --> 04:22.508
Did you bring anything less bloody tohange into?
Why?

04:22.708 --> 04:24.094
I don't know.
It's a nice place.

04:24.094 --> 04:25.533
It wouldn't kill you
to dress up once in a while.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.664
Pretty girl.
You're a pretty girl.

04:30.316 --> 04:31.357
I am a pretty girl.

04:33.222 --> 04:34.721
Okay, guys.
So nine years ago,

04:34.721 --> 04:36.635
Joseph was my first
appendectomy patient.

04:36.635 --> 04:38.301
Since then,
some scar tissue has formed,

04:38.601 --> 04:40.212
So we're gonna
clear that right up.

04:40.900 --> 04:42.892
Joseph, my old friend,
we'll take care of you.Med,

04:42.892 --> 04:45.122
But first,
you gotta give me what need.

04:45.796 --> 04:48.060
<i>Bonjour, dr. Turk.
Ã‡a va bien?</i>

04:48.060 --> 04:50.414
Ha ha!
Brother speaks french.

04:50.414 --> 04:52.212
That's a romance language,
y'all!

04:52.412 --> 04:54.794
Anyway, it says here
that we're delaying surgery

04:54.794 --> 04:57.618
Due to topical irritation
near the incision site.

04:57.918 --> 04:59.914
If you guys will excuse me 
for a second, that'd be great.

05:01.295 --> 05:04.499
Dude's a goner.
I see it in his eyes.

05:04.754 --> 05:07.007
He's haitian.
It's a poisonwood berry burn.

05:07.607 --> 05:09.693
How do you know?
Trust me, I know.

05:10.193 --> 05:11.225
Boy george!

05:11.225 --> 05:13.797
If you're right, you could seal
the deal for keynote speaker.

05:13.797 --> 05:15.471
Mm. Too little, too late.

05:15.471 --> 05:18.410
My fam just donated
another m.R.I. Thingy.

05:19.440 --> 05:21.522
Joseph, we're gonna
solve this puzzle,

05:21.522 --> 05:22.692
And in thanks, you'll say...

05:22.892 --> 05:23.997
<i>Merci beaucoup.</i>

05:23.997 --> 05:26.880
Merci beaucoup! (laughs)

05:26.980 --> 05:29.551
Incredible.
Uh, dr. Turk?

05:29.551 --> 05:31.581
Yes?
I think I know what's wrong.

05:31.781 --> 05:34.665
It's a reaction to the acidic
black poisonwood berry.

05:34.665 --> 05:36.608
They're common on joseph's
home island of haiti--
home island of haiti.

05:36.608 --> 05:38.263
Damn, I was just going
to say that.

05:38.863 --> 05:41.725
Keep it up, drew. Catches like
this could save someone's life.

05:46.879 --> 05:49.470
Dr. Cox? I know why
I want to be a doctor.

05:49.770 --> 05:52.774
I want to use my experience
to make the kind of catches

05:52.674 --> 05:56.716
That save lives, To give people
a chance to live--

05:56.846 --> 05:57.684
Hold that thought.

05:58.284 --> 06:00.859
Time of death-- 4:23 p..

06:06.099 --> 06:07.275
(lucy) oh.

06:07.275 --> 06:08.733
I am very, uh...

06:10.046 --> 06:12.198
His middle name is ulysses.

06:16.005 --> 06:20.148
Sync by ReHelen

06:20.148 --> 06:28.042
www.assic7ed.com

06:32.068 --> 06:34.436
'sup, holmes?
Don't call me "holmes."

06:34.437 --> 06:36.138
Actually, I like "holmes."
I'll allow it.

06:36.708 --> 06:38.707
What are you doing?
Oh, just surfing the web,

06:38.707 --> 06:40.103
Watching all
the white coat speeches,

06:40.103 --> 06:43.020
Cherry-picking the best parts for mine.
Solid plan.

06:43.633 --> 06:44.083
Hey, drew.

06:44.083 --> 06:46.932
Turns out you were right about
the haitian berry reaction.

06:47.132 --> 06:50.918
<i>I guess your diagnosis
wasn't rash after all.</i>

06:53.006 --> 06:55.718
See, j.D.? I told you
they wouldn't laugh.

07:01.190 --> 07:02.408
Genius, man.

07:02.408 --> 07:05.771
You lalow at first, then
the white coat thing comes up,

07:05.771 --> 07:08.139
And boom!
You turn into a gunner.

07:08.174 --> 07:09.968
Wh--I'm not a gunner.

07:09.968 --> 07:12.956
(scoffs) please.
Always got the right answer,

07:12.956 --> 07:15.401
Being all helpful with
that island berry dude.

07:16.324 --> 07:17.871
Dude,
we are exactly the same.

07:18.071 --> 07:18.832
<i>We...</i>

07:19.386 --> 07:21.116
Are not the same.

07:21.116 --> 07:23.752
You're a selfish, petty child

07:23.753 --> 07:25.518
Who would screw over
anybody to get ahead.

07:26.569 --> 07:27.719
Like you did with roger?

07:28.147 --> 07:30.697
<i>The second-best dentist
at a run-down strip mall.</i>

07:31.573 --> 07:32.163
<i>You get it.</i>

07:37.498 --> 07:40.669
I followed him.
He called his folks crying.

07:40.669 --> 07:42.539
It was awesome.

07:44.265 --> 07:46.100
It's like looking
in a mirror, holmes.

07:46.100 --> 07:48.060
(grunts)

07:48.532 --> 07:49.590
Ahem.

07:53.263 --> 07:54.018
Dr. Cox?

07:54.018 --> 07:54.533
(grunts)

07:56.338 --> 07:59.421
I've done some soul-searching,
and I have a new answer.

07:59.421 --> 08:01.285
T me prep for
the verbal brilliance

08:01.285 --> 08:02.887
That is surely headed
my way.

08:04.086 --> 08:05.935
Ha. Proceed.

08:06.135 --> 08:07.344
I want to become a doctor

08:07.344 --> 08:10.099
So I can help people
who can't help themselves.

08:10.099 --> 08:11.837
Lame.
When my grandmother was ill--

08:11.837 --> 08:14.449
Boo!
See, dr. Quinn was a medicine woman--

08:14.449 --> 08:18.135
Stop. Now this is when I would
normally launch into a rant.

08:18.135 --> 08:19.893
But I've already told you
what the consequences are

08:19.893 --> 08:21.891
If you don't come up
with an acceptable answer

08:21.891 --> 08:22.840
Prior to the ceremony.

08:22.840 --> 08:25.373
Right now you've got
four strikes on you.

08:25.373 --> 08:28.731
And even in the adjusted
lucy bennett 5-strike system

08:28.731 --> 08:30.809
That I recently established
to accommodate

08:30.809 --> 08:32.839
All major underachievers--
go ahead and take a second

08:32.839 --> 08:34.567
And be happy that something
was named after you--

08:34.567 --> 08:37.879
Ya still need to ce up
with something better.

08:37.879 --> 08:41.110
One more pathetic,
clichÃ©d answer and you're gone.

08:42.309 --> 08:43.803
That was kind of a rant.

08:45.397 --> 08:48.018
Hey, why did you guys
want to become doctors?

08:48.753 --> 08:50.128
Oh, actually,
I didn't want to be a doctor.

08:50.428 --> 08:53.779
I wanted to be a gymnast.
But I was chesty for my age,

08:53.779 --> 08:55.624
And I had no balce
because when I was 9,

08:55.624 --> 08:58.153
My cousin jammed a piece
of uncooked pasta in my ear.

08:58.353 --> 08:59.844
So the first time I went
on the balance beam,

08:59.844 --> 09:01.873
I fell off and broke
my bajingo bone.

09:01.973 --> 09:05.707
So really I became a doctor
because my parents made me.

09:06.896 --> 09:08.133
How about you, dr. Mahoney?

09:08.133 --> 09:10.865
I like scabs.
(mouths word)

09:11.250 --> 09:13.275
Hey, drew,
want to come over tonight

09:13.275 --> 09:14.390
And watch one
of those survival shows

09:14.390 --> 09:17.855
And root forhe guy to die?
Tonight's not a good night, denise.

09:21.180 --> 09:21.436
(elevator bell dings)

09:23.393 --> 09:24.659
Hey, work buddy.
Hey.

09:24.659 --> 09:25.517
You have a sec?

09:25.517 --> 09:27.493
Yeah.
What do you want to do?

09:27.493 --> 09:28.807
You want to play
a quick "hide the saltine"?

09:28.807 --> 09:30.161
Maybe "giant black doctor"?

09:30.161 --> 09:33.830
Damn, those never sounded dirty with j.D.
Yes, they did.

09:33.830 --> 09:36.730
Oh.
Actually, I was hoping
I could get a lile advice.

09:36.730 --> 09:41.747
(imitating woman)
tell mama yo' problems, baby.
I'm having relationship issues
with drew.

09:41.747 --> 09:44.035
(normal voice) I know...
Just what to do.

09:44.035 --> 09:46.283
Great. I'm out.

09:46.283 --> 09:48.958
Okay, so he made a comment
about wanting you to look nice,

09:48.958 --> 09:51.834
And then you blew him off and mocked him.
Yeah, called him a girl.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.174
Oh, fantastic. Okay.

09:53.174 --> 09:55.103
Uh, does drew ever do
anything nice for you?.

09:55.103 --> 09:59.562
And do you ever doanything for him?
Oh, no. Who wants to travel down that road?

09:59.562 --> 10:01.825
Denise, like it or not,
you're in a relationship.

10:01.825 --> 10:03.229
Sometimes you have to do things you
 don't want to do,

10:03.229 --> 10:05.470
Like dressing nice
or, in my case,

10:05.470 --> 10:08.481
Going to the zoo twice a month.
I still don't know why j.D.

10:08.481 --> 10:10.092
Is so obsessed
with those damn penguins.

10:10.092 --> 10:12.638
It's because they look
like little formal people.

10:12.638 --> 10:15.819
They're--they'r. We like tohink 
turk, if you're out, then stay out.

10:15.819 --> 10:19.178
Fine!
So to make drew happy,

10:19.178 --> 10:20.985
I have to start wearing
tutus and prom dresses?

10:20.985 --> 10:22.877
That would look adorable,
but no.

10:22.877 --> 10:25.978
Just throw on something sexy
once in a while, you know?

10:25.978 --> 10:27.332
Show him you care.

10:28.292 --> 10:30.107
(high-pitched british accent)
anyone fancy a swim?

10:31.256 --> 10:34.218
(laughs) what?
That's how they sound.

10:34.218 --> 10:36.114
<i>(laughing) that is
the way they sound.</i>

10:38.771 --> 10:39.650
Where are you going?

10:40.333 --> 10:43.632
Hey, cole, you know
how when we make love,

10:43.632 --> 10:45.612
I can't look into your eyes
because they're so empty

10:45.612 --> 10:47.735
And soulless, so I just
cover them with my hands?

10:47.735 --> 10:49.842
Uh, yeah, it's cool.
I can see through your fingers.

10:49.842 --> 10:52.002
Well, I can get past that

10:52.002 --> 10:54.090
If you'll be real
with me just once.

10:54.090 --> 10:58.706
Why do you want to be a doctor?
Why the hell not?

10:59.067 --> 11:01.477
Now that's a good answer.
How could that be a good answer?

11:01.477 --> 11:02.628
Because he meant it.

11:03.590 --> 11:04.506
What's up, chiefs?

11:04.506 --> 11:07.414
(imitates explosion)
I hope the school has insurance,

11:07.414 --> 11:08.350
'cause my keynote speech

11:08.350 --> 11:12.754
Is gonna blow the roof off this mother!
You, son, are a very odd little squid.

11:12.754 --> 11:16.299
(laughs)
oh, hey, wait. I want to talk to you.

11:16.299 --> 11:18.534
Your academic record is impeccable,

11:18.534 --> 11:21.287
And dr. Turk told me about your catch

11:21.287 --> 11:22.920
With the poisonwood berry burn.

11:22.920 --> 11:25.893
You are our choice as keynote speaker

11:25.893 --> 11:29.800
For the white coat ceremony.
Oh! Congratulations.

11:29.800 --> 11:31.967
It's tantamount to getting
half off on a cup of soup.

11:32.833 --> 11:34.825
<i>Who knows why we do
the things we do?</i>

11:34.825 --> 11:37.504
<i>Sometimes we're just trying
to make someone else happy.</i>

11:38.790 --> 11:42.403
So you think that outfit is sexy?
Yeah.

11:42.403 --> 11:44.033
'cause I'm free-boobin' it.

11:44.966 --> 11:47.816
<i>Other times we leave people
searching for explanations.</i>

11:47.816 --> 11:49.949
I-I don't want to be
the keynote speaker.

11:50.690 --> 11:51.703
But thanks.

11:54.104 --> 11:56.815
Well, that's disappointing.

11:56.815 --> 11:59.103
Hmm. I was gonna say,
"who cares?"

11:59.813 --> 12:03.422
<i>But in our weakest moments,
it's all about jealousy.</i>

12:03.422 --> 12:06.106
Hey, dr. Turk, I need to
show you something on the web.

12:06.106 --> 12:08.177
Is it a cat doing something
a human would do?

12:08.177 --> 12:10.579
'cause if it is, I'm in.
Mm, something with drew.

12:10.579 --> 12:15.364
And a cat?
No. Just look. This is from ten years ago, dude.

12:15.364 --> 12:17.490
<i>(man) that dream
is finally realized,</i>

12:17.490 --> 12:18.943
<i>And as doctors... (grunts)</i>

12:18.943 --> 12:23.714
<i>(microphone feedback whines)
this ceremony is a joke, okay?</i>

12:23.714 --> 12:26.936
<i>I'm better than all you fools,
and you guys, too--hey!</i>

12:26.936 --> 12:27.991
<i>I have something to say!</i>

12:27.991 --> 12:30.284
<i>I don't need to be
keynote speaker! Okay?</i>

12:30.284 --> 12:32.190
<i>You don't deserve
these coats!</i>

12:32.190 --> 12:34.084
<i>You don't deserve
these coats, okay?</i>

12:34.084 --> 12:35.511
<i>You better rognize!</i>

12:36.609 --> 12:38.128
Have you showed this
to anybody?

12:38.128 --> 12:40.434
<i>(lucy)
still, nothing's as painful</i>

12:40.434 --> 12:41.769
<i>As hiding from the past.</i>

12:41.769 --> 12:47.772
Hey, drew! "you better recognize"?
It's something people said in the '90s.

12:47.772 --> 12:49.088
Cool people?

12:50.009 --> 12:51.818
No.

12:56.298 --> 12:57.428
(woman) recognize!

12:57.428 --> 12:59.106
(all) recognize!

12:59.106 --> 13:00.839
Yes, hello.

13:01.606 --> 13:02.762
It's me.

13:04.149 --> 13:05.305
(under breath)
how could this be any worse?

13:07.884 --> 13:11.401
(crying) scientists
taught horses to talk,

13:11.401 --> 13:14.958
And it turns out because we've
ridden them all these years,

13:14.958 --> 13:17.748
They don't like humans!

13:17.748 --> 13:20.054
(sobbing)

13:20.055 --> 13:22.734
Ohh. I don't even want
to think about it.

13:22.734 --> 13:24.184
What the hell's wrong
with cole?

13:25.239 --> 13:28.734
<i>Drew.
Doctors are much more than just physicians.</i>

13:28.734 --> 13:31.375
<i>They can be mentors...
Come with me.</i>

13:33.478 --> 13:35.306
<i>Disciplinarians...
Come with me!</i>

13:35.306 --> 13:36.682
Aah! Aah! Aah!

13:37.891 --> 13:39.297
<i>Even fashion advisors.</i>

13:39.297 --> 13:40.485
Come with me.

13:41.083 --> 13:41.977
I'm with a patient.

13:44.187 --> 13:46.468
(scoffs)
dementia? Please.

13:46.468 --> 13:48.399
Don't bring that weak sauce
in here.

13:48.399 --> 13:51.834
He'll never know you're gone.
Fine. I'll just take
my jacket off,

13:51.834 --> 13:54.021
Put it over the I.V. Stand,

13:54.021 --> 13:55.995
And he'll probably think
it's still me.
Sweet.

13:55.995 --> 13:59.713
Let's see what we have. Mm.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.173
Oh, you definitely need
my blue eyes for this one

14:02.173 --> 14:05.256
And my pregnancy boobs
for this one.

14:05.256 --> 14:07.605
Honestly, if I could give up
five years of my life

14:07.605 --> 14:09.598
To keep these bad boys,
I would, you know,

14:09.598 --> 14:11.119
As long as I had a guarantee
that I'd live until,

14:11.119 --> 14:13.302
Like, my 80s.
Yeah, you should bring that up to god

14:13.302 --> 14:18.179
When he grants you your magic boobs.
Oh, in my head, it wasn't god. It was a genie. Oh, yes.

14:18.179 --> 14:20.213
And we're gonna need to figure
out what to do with these.

14:20.213 --> 14:22.997
Wow. You're like the sister
I never wanted.

14:22.997 --> 14:26.683
Aw! Oh, really?(chuckles)
 I'm not doing any of this.

14:26.683 --> 14:28.989
That is what the ugly duckling
always says in the movies,

14:28.989 --> 14:30.297
But then she
takes her glasses off,

14:30.297 --> 14:33.813
And everyone thinks she's beautiful.
Did--did you just call me an uy duckling?

14:33.813 --> 14:36.373
Oh, look. There's lucy.
Hey, lucy.

14:36.373 --> 14:39.443
D you see drew's video?
What video?

14:39.443 --> 14:42.335
Come on!
Too bad about your boy drew.

14:42.335 --> 14:44.363
But no worries.
I'll pick up the slack.

14:44.363 --> 14:46.311
I already wrote
the beginning of my speech.

14:46.311 --> 14:48.659
So I open up with a line
from the movie "malice"--

14:48.659 --> 14:53.102
(gruff voice) "you ask me if I
have a god complex? I am god!"

14:53.102 --> 14:55.232
(normal voice)
boom! We're in.
Yeah, you damn sure are.

14:57.925 --> 15:00.082
I don't think the lock
works on that door,

15:00.082 --> 15:01.766
So if he tries to get out,
subdue him.

15:01.766 --> 15:04.247
Sleeper hold or full nelson?
Dealer's choice.

15:04.247 --> 15:06.396
I'll see what els right.
Fair enough.

15:06.396 --> 15:10.671
Come out if you want to, boy.
Daddy's waitin'.

15:10.671 --> 15:13.009
Why am I scrubbing in
again?

15:13.009 --> 15:14.605
The o.R. Is a safe place.

15:14.605 --> 15:16.933
Nobody's gonna yell
"recognize" at you in here.

15:18.361 --> 15:19.334
Can I ask you a question?

15:19.334 --> 15:22.345
Why do white people
ruin everything?

15:22.345 --> 15:24.524
I only got to say
"fo shizzle" for a week.

15:24.524 --> 15:27.564
A week! And what's up
with you and that video?

15:28.024 --> 15:30.284
The psychologists called it
"an unbalanced act."

15:30.285 --> 15:32.286
But I don't care
about that video.

15:32.287 --> 15:34.226
I just hate that it
reminds me of who I was.

15:35.091 --> 15:36.921
What are the three
categories of presentation

15:36.921 --> 15:39.970
In crohn's disease?
Stricturing, penetrating and inflammatory.

15:39.970 --> 15:43.148
Sorry, dr. Reynolds. Looks like
nobody else studied. (laughs)

15:44.609 --> 15:47.015
(lowers voice)
psst. Little help?

15:49.692 --> 15:52.962
Thanks. (normal voice) oh!
This kid's got a cheat sheet!

15:52.962 --> 15:55.764
That doesn't seem fair to
the rest of us. I'm just sayin'.

15:56.670 --> 15:58.309
I pulled every dirty trick
in the book,

15:58.309 --> 15:59.945
And I still didn't get
chosen as keynote speaker.

15:59.945 --> 16:02.847
<i>That honor went to eric puritsky.
And as doctors... (grunts)</i>

16:03.743 --> 16:06.299
Let me get this straight.
You turned down keynote speaker

16:06.299 --> 16:08.319
Because you're worried
you're becoming that guy again?

16:08.319 --> 16:10.628
I think m already there.

16:11.308 --> 16:12.826
Huh.

16:14.549 --> 16:16.896
Okay. Thank you so much
for letting me dress you up.

16:16.896 --> 16:18.653
I really needed some closure
on the whole makeover thing.

16:18.653 --> 16:21.700
Okay, now take your glasses off,
let that hair down

16:21.700 --> 16:23.235
And act like you don't know
how pretty you are.

16:24.089 --> 16:28.142

16:40.855 --> 16:42.956
There it is! Mm!

16:42.957 --> 16:45.559
What is with the sad face?
(glasses clatter)

16:45.560 --> 16:47.561
Dr. Cox is still in my head

16:47.562 --> 16:49.509
About this whole "why do you
want to be a doctor?" thing.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.002
I just--I can't think
of the answer

16:51.002 --> 16:52.202
That he wants, you know?

16:53.278 --> 16:56.285
And you don't think your amazing
new look will take care of that?

16:57.441 --> 16:58.740
I really don't.

17:00.705 --> 17:03.174
Then maybe you should stop
looking for the perfect answer

17:03.174 --> 17:05.484
And just tell him
what you actually think.

17:07.349 --> 17:10.634
You see that, drew?
That's scar tissue.

17:11.555 --> 17:13.522
Nine years ago
when joseph came to me,

17:13.522 --> 17:15.900
I popped out his appendix
and screwed up the closure.

17:17.025 --> 17:18.365
I was so focused
on the abdomen

17:18.365 --> 17:21.066
That I blew the cosmesis
of the incision.

17:22.236 --> 17:24.287
Nowadays I know better,

17:24.287 --> 17:26.578
And I can fix it without
making the same mistake.

17:28.172 --> 17:31.019
And because of that,
I don't have to beat myself up

17:31.019 --> 17:33.108
Over something that
happened a long timago.

17:33.108 --> 17:35.932
So what are you gonna do,
drew?

17:35.932 --> 17:38.446
(monitor beeping steadily)

17:39.452 --> 17:42.115
I'm gonna scrub out.

17:43.316 --> 17:43.753
Hey.

17:44.160 --> 17:46.299
I saw that video. Crazy.

17:46.299 --> 17:48.738
Yeah. It's like my own personal
"don't tase me, bro!"

17:49.454 --> 17:51.281
That's why you've been weird, huh?
Pretty much.

17:51.976 --> 17:52.745
I thought it was about me,

17:53.487 --> 17:55.206
'cause I wouldn't dress
all girly-gay for you.

17:55.852 --> 17:58.026
What? No. I mean,
I guess I'd like to see you

17:58.026 --> 18:00.383
Like that some time, but...

18:01.683 --> 18:04.615
I would never ask you
to do that.

18:07.025 --> 18:08.747
I gotta go.

18:12.003 --> 18:13.877
<i>(drew) why do I want
to be a doctor?</i>

18:14.658 --> 18:16.593
(man) ? the sun won't shine ?

18:17.629 --> 18:19.362
Recognize!
Recognize!

18:19.397 --> 18:22.209
<i>Because the road sure as hell isn't easy...
(man) recognize.</i>

18:22.321 --> 18:24.814
<i>And there always seems to be
something standing in your way.</i>

18:24.814 --> 18:27.935
(snoring)
? and my plans go awry ?

18:29.322 --> 18:31.199
<i>Sometimes it's even yourself.</i>

18:32.968 --> 18:33.612
Dr. Cox.

18:33.612 --> 18:35.170
Oh! Dear god.

18:35.170 --> 18:37.133
I don't have
your pfect answer.

18:37.895 --> 18:40.307
At first I thought it was
to make my family proud,

18:40.307 --> 18:42.736
And then I thought
it was about saving lives,

18:42.736 --> 18:44.895
And for one second,
I thought it was a chance

18:44.895 --> 18:46.729
To get closer
to dr. Sanjay gupta,

18:46.729 --> 18:49.624
Who is a beautiful indian man,
and I've never visited

18:49.624 --> 18:53.649
That continent romantically,
if you know what I mean.
Unfortunately, I do.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.884
Anyway, the truth is
I can't pick just one reason.

18:59.040 --> 19:02.835
Oh, my god.
That's the answer.

19:03.967 --> 19:06.519
I want to be a doctor
for all those reasons

19:06.519 --> 19:09.858
And a million more that I
haven't even thought of yet.

19:09.858 --> 19:13.412
That's not bad.
Come on. Let's go.

19:13.412 --> 19:15.622
We're gonna be late
for the white coat ceremony.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.914
Ooh, plus I look super cute
in white.

19:18.900 --> 19:20.456
Now you ruined it.

19:20.456 --> 19:23.875
Luckily, we're surrounded
by amazing individuals,

19:23.875 --> 19:26.013
Talented faculty,

19:26.013 --> 19:27.948
Dedicated mentors,

19:27.948 --> 19:32.958
Outstanding students
who all strive for excellence.

19:34.067 --> 19:36.310
? and every time
my heart will sing ?

19:38.469 --> 19:39.585
And then there's
the new friends

19:40.401 --> 19:42.044
Who make it all
a little easier to handle.

19:43.813 --> 19:47.572
So, uh, in closing, I'd like
to give a simple response

19:47.572 --> 19:51.267
To dr. Cox's question--
why do I want to be a doctor?

19:51.267 --> 19:54.210
Well... Because...

19:55.437 --> 19:57.142
Doctors give people
second chances.

19:58.321 --> 20:01.590
And we all deserve
a second chance.

20:05.855 --> 20:07.370
You better recognize.

20:07.701 --> 20:08.522
(laughter)

20:08.522 --> 20:10.469
(cheering)

20:10.469 --> 20:13.128
(drew speaks indistinctly)

20:17.367 --> 20:20.255
Hey, I know how you're really
mad at the internet right now.

20:20.255 --> 20:22.185
Well, it taketh away,
but it also giveth.

20:22.185 --> 20:24.366
(typing on keyboard)

20:26.009 --> 20:27.816
<i>(cole) and meet the crew!
