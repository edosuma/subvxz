02:45.599 --> 02:47.167
WE NEED TO ELECT
A REPRESENTATIVE

02:47.235 --> 02:49.203

SCHOOL BOARD MEETING.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.439
WHAT FOR?

02:51.505 --> 02:54.041

IN THE PARKING LOT,

02:54.107 --> 02:55.376
MORE HEAT
IN LOCKER ROOMS,

02:55.443 --> 02:58.246

EXCITING

04:01.542 --> 04:03.311
WHEN TWO PEOPLE

WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
SHE'S SMART AND POPULAR.

05:05.539 --> 05:07.875
YOU'RE RIGHT.
SHE'LL BE TOUGH TO BEAT.

05:09.443 --> 05:11.211
LET'S NOT TAKE
ANY CHANCES.

05:11.278 --> 05:12.446
GET SOME DIRT ON HER.

05:12.513 --> 05:15.783

GOODY-GOODY.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.785
OH, COME ON!

05:17.851 --> 05:21.221
SHE HASN'T CHEATED
ON A TEST, PLAYED HOOKY,

05:21.288 --> 05:23.624
OR TEASED
THE FOOTBALL TEAM?

05:23.691 --> 05:26.994
NO. YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE
THAT DOES THAT STUFF.

05:35.068 --> 05:36.504
MY CAR WAS
BROKEN INTO.

05:36.570 --> 05:38.105
OH, MY GOODNESS!

05:38.171 --> 05:42.209
MY KID'S BIKE WAS
STOLEN RIGHT OFF
THE FRONT LAWN!

05:42.275 --> 05:44.011
IN BROAD DAYLIGHT!

05:44.077 --> 05:45.979
OH, NO!

05:46.046 --> 05:48.416
LAST NIGHT, A STRANGE MAN
POUNDED ON MY DOOR

05:48.482 --> 05:50.117
ALL NIGHT LONG.

05:50.183 --> 05:51.419
WHAT DID YOU DO?

05:51.485 --> 05:53.421
I FINALLY LET HIM OUT.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.765
YOU SHOULD'VE SENT
HIM OVER HERE.

06:07.668 --> 06:10.404
MRS. PUDNEY.
MOTHER.

06:10.471 --> 06:11.672
THIS IS SERIOUS.

06:14.207 --> 06:15.509
OKAY, FOLKS,

06:15.576 --> 06:18.546
AS A VETERAN COP
OF 18 YEARS,

06:18.612 --> 06:19.980
I'LL CERTAINLY TELL YOU

06:20.047 --> 06:22.416
THAT CRIME IS INCREASING
ALL OVER THIS CITY.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.384
YOU'RE RIGHT
ABOUT THAT.

06:24.452 --> 06:26.854
BUT WHAT CAN WE DO?

06:26.920 --> 06:29.189
WE'LL START
A NEIGHBORHOOD
WATCH PROGRAM.

06:29.256 --> 06:31.158
GOOD IDEA.

06:31.224 --> 06:34.895
THAT'S EXACTLY WHY I CALLED
YOU FOLKS HERE TONIGHT.

06:34.962 --> 06:36.129
YOU SEE,

06:36.196 --> 06:39.467
IF WE'RE GOING TO FORM
A NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH,

06:39.533 --> 06:42.235
WE MUST HAVE A
NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH LEADER.

06:42.302 --> 06:43.270
YOU'RE RIGHT.

06:43.336 --> 06:44.304
GOOD IDEA.

06:44.371 --> 06:48.408
AND THIS LEADER...

06:48.476 --> 06:49.810
SHOULD HAVE COURAGE...

06:49.877 --> 06:51.211
OH, YES.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.412
WISDOM...

06:52.480 --> 06:53.814
MM-HMM.

06:53.881 --> 06:55.215
AND CHARISMA.

06:55.282 --> 06:56.917
YEAH,
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:58.251 --> 06:59.887
AND A UNIFORM.

06:59.953 --> 07:01.822
OH YEAH.

07:01.889 --> 07:06.126
SO I HUMBLY SUGGEST THAT OUR
LEADER IS NONE OTHER THAN--

07:06.193 --> 07:07.294
HARRIETTE WINSLOW.

07:07.360 --> 07:08.596
THAT'S RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

07:08.662 --> 07:10.498
HARRIETTE WINSLOW?

07:10.564 --> 07:13.100
HARRIETTE'S PERFECT!

07:13.166 --> 07:14.602

POLICE TRAINING,

07:14.668 --> 07:16.269
SHE WORKS IN SECURITY,

07:16.336 --> 07:19.372
AND SHE'S THE SMARTEST
PERSON I KNOW.

07:19.439 --> 07:20.841
BERNIE...

07:22.676 --> 07:24.444
YOU ALSO KNOW ME.

07:26.547 --> 07:27.848

07:33.020 --> 07:34.522
SIT DOWN, BERNIE.

07:34.588 --> 07:38.258

HARRIETTE IS THE
PERFECT CHOICE.

07:38.325 --> 07:40.260
NOW, WHAT DO YOU
THINK?

07:40.327 --> 07:41.862
I'M A LITTLE
OVERWHELMED.

07:41.929 --> 07:42.763
COME ON!

07:42.830 --> 07:46.233
LET'S ALL GO DOWN
TO THE WILD BOAR

07:46.299 --> 07:47.868

07:47.935 --> 07:49.603

08:03.216 --> 08:04.752
HOW COULD I WHAT?

08:04.818 --> 08:07.988
I WANTED TO BE
THE WATCH LEADER.

08:08.055 --> 08:11.258
IT WAS MY IDEA FOR
THE NEIGHBORHOOD WATCH.

08:11.324 --> 08:12.492
CARL...

08:12.560 --> 08:15.162
I MEAN,
I CALLED THE MEETING.

08:15.228 --> 08:16.429

08:16.496 --> 08:18.766
YOU DIDN'T STUFF
THE CELERY, HARRIETTE.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.934
I STUFFED THE CELERY.

08:21.001 --> 08:24.237
WHY DON'T YOU
STUFF IT NOW, CARL?

08:24.304 --> 08:25.539
OH, THAT'S SO FUNNY.

08:25.606 --> 08:27.007
THAT'S A SCREAM,

08:27.074 --> 08:29.743
WHAT WILL YOU DO
WHEN YOU REALIZE

08:29.810 --> 08:32.112
YOU CAN'T HANDLE
THE JOB?

08:32.179 --> 08:33.480
I CAN HANDLE THE JOB.

08:33.547 --> 08:36.617
OH! OH! OH! OH!

SQUEAKY CLEAN.

09:29.436 --> 09:33.741
OH, WHAT A BORE.

09:33.807 --> 09:35.676
LAURA, WHEN YOU GET
ELECTED PRESIDENT,

09:35.743 --> 09:37.477
CAN I BE
YOUR FIRST MAN?

09:37.544 --> 09:39.346
STEVE--

10:13.446 --> 10:14.682
TIME'S UP.

10:16.483 --> 10:19.319
LOOK, BECKY SUE,
POOR LAURA HAS
WORKED SO HARD,

10:19.386 --> 10:22.155
AND NOW SHE'LL HAVE TO
DROP OUT OF THE RACE.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.256
WHAT?

10:23.323 --> 10:26.660
WE JUST GOT HOT PHOTOS
OF YOU BEING ROMANCED

10:26.727 --> 10:28.395
BY THE PRINCE
OF PASSION HERE.

10:29.562 --> 10:30.563
BUT SHE
JUST SLIPPED,

10:30.630 --> 10:32.465
AND I CAUGHT HER,
THAT'S ALL.

10:32.532 --> 10:36.670
BECKY SUE, WE SHOULD
PUT THOSE PICTURES
IN THE SCHOOL PAPER!

10:36.737 --> 10:38.972
OH, WE COULDN'T
DO THAT.

10:39.039 --> 10:40.507
EVERYBODY WOULD
THINK THAT LAURA'S

10:40.573 --> 10:42.109
IN LOVE
WITH STEVE URKEL,

10:42.175 --> 10:44.678
AND NO ONE
WOULD VOTE FOR HER.

10:47.214 --> 10:49.082
BUT I TOLD YOU,

10:49.149 --> 10:50.684
I JUST CAUGHT HER,
THAT'S ALL!

10:50.751 --> 10:54.554
THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED,
BUT THAT WON'T BE
WHAT PEOPLE BELIEVE.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.857
THEY JUST LOVE
JUICY GOSSIP.

10:56.924 --> 10:58.391
YOU WOULDN'T DARE.

10:58.458 --> 11:01.962
TRY ME. YOU'VE GOT
24 HOURS TO DROP

11:26.353 --> 11:27.721
TO MAKE EVERYBODY
THINK

11:27.788 --> 11:30.523
THAT THE WOMAN I LOVE
ACTUALLY LOVES ME BACK--

11:30.590 --> 11:33.060
WHY, HOW LOW
CAN YOU GET?

11:36.496 --> 11:38.265
WELL, I GOT A SURPRISE
FOR HER.

11:38.331 --> 11:39.432
YOU DO?

11:39.499 --> 11:42.836
SHE'S SO CERTAIN I'M GOING
TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE.

11:42.903 --> 11:44.972
WELL, NO WAY.
NOBODY PUSHES ME AROUND.

11:45.038 --> 11:48.041
I'D RATHER HAVE THE WORLD
THINK I WAS IN LOVE WITH YOU

11:48.108 --> 11:49.676
THAN CAVE INTO
HER BLACKMAIL FROM HER.

11:49.743 --> 11:52.512
BESIDES, THERE'S THINGS THAT
NEED TO BE DONE IN THIS SCHOOL.

11:52.579 --> 11:55.983
THAT WON'T HAPPEN AS LONG
AS CASSIE LYNN NUBBLES
IS IN OFFICE.

12:01.789 --> 12:04.091
OH! ROCK MY WORLD, BABY!

12:12.432 --> 12:15.836
IF YOU NOTICE ANY
SUSPICIOUS BEHAVIOR,
DON'T DO ANYTHING.

12:15.903 --> 12:17.537
JUST CALL ON
YOUR WALKIE-TALKIE,

12:17.604 --> 12:19.239
AND I'LL NOTIFY
THE POLICE.

12:19.306 --> 12:20.273
GOT IT.

12:20.340 --> 12:23.143
OKAY, WE'LL DO
A COMMUNICATIONS
CHECK.

12:23.210 --> 12:26.379
COME IN, SQUAD 1.
DO YOU READ ME,
SQUAD 1?

12:26.446 --> 12:29.950
HELLO, HOME BASE,
THIS IS SLICK CHICK. OVER.

12:31.518 --> 12:33.486
HOT MAMA HERE.

12:35.622 --> 12:37.190
COME BACK TO ME.

12:39.492 --> 12:40.961
IT LOOKS LIKE
WE'RE ALL SET.

12:41.028 --> 12:43.897
"ALL SET."
GIVE ME A BREAK.

12:43.964 --> 12:45.833
WHAT IS IT, CARL?

12:45.899 --> 12:48.802
NOTHING. FAR BE IT FROM ME
TO BUTT IN.

12:48.869 --> 12:51.771
AFTER ALL, I'M NOT
THE WATCH LEADER.

12:51.839 --> 12:54.374
IF YOU HAVE ANYTHING
TO SAY, SAY IT.

12:55.142 --> 12:58.578
OKAY, SINCE YOU ASKED.

12:58.645 --> 13:00.047
I...PERSONALLY...

13:00.113 --> 13:01.982
WOULD NOT SEND
TWO DEFENSELESS WOMEN

13:02.049 --> 13:03.416
OUT INTO
THE DEAD OF NIGHT,

13:03.483 --> 13:06.419
ESPECIALLY WHEN ONE
OF THEM IS 80
YEARS OLD.

13:06.486 --> 13:08.588
81.

13:08.655 --> 13:10.690
AND IF ANYBODY
MESSES WITH ME,

13:10.757 --> 13:13.193
THEY'LL BE SNACKING
ON THEIR OWN TEETH.

13:16.063 --> 13:17.931
CARL, I KNOW BETTER

13:17.998 --> 13:19.799
THAN TO SEND
TWO WOMEN OUT ALONE.

13:19.867 --> 13:21.334
YOU'RE ON DUTY
WITH THEM.

13:21.401 --> 13:25.072
WHAT? I'M ON DUTY?
WHY DIDN'T YOU
TELL ME?

13:25.138 --> 13:27.574
I POSTED THE
SCHEDULE, CARL.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.076
I DIDN'T SEE IT,
HARRIETTE.

13:29.142 --> 13:30.911
HOW'D YOU
MISS IT?

13:30.978 --> 13:32.980
IT WAS IN YOUR
FAVORITE SPOT.

13:33.847 --> 13:35.382
AND WHERE'S THAT?

13:35.448 --> 13:37.517
THE REFRIGERATOR.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.255
OKAY, LET'S
GET THIS SO-CALLED

13:44.057 --> 13:47.194
WAIT A MINUTE.
I HAVE TO NOTIFY
YOUR TEAM LEADER.

13:47.260 --> 13:49.897
COME IN,
CAPTAIN FUNKY FRESH.

13:49.963 --> 13:51.865
TIME TO MOVE OUT.

13:55.068 --> 13:58.205
HAVE NO FEAR,
CAPTAIN FUNKY FRESH IS HERE.

14:03.243 --> 14:05.845
MY TEAM LEADER
IS A FUNKY FRESH?

14:05.913 --> 14:09.582
LISTEN, I WANT YOU
TO WATCH OUT
FOR EACH OTHER.

14:09.649 --> 14:12.685
AND BE BACK AT 10:00
WHEN THE GORDONS
TAKE OVER.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.587
I MAY WORK A DOUBLE SHIFT.

14:14.654 --> 14:18.791
WENDY GORDON'S ONE NEIGHBOR
I REALLY WANT TO WATCH.

14:18.858 --> 14:21.861

A LONG, LOUSY NIGHT.

I'M RICH.

14:46.786 --> 14:50.924
VOTE FOR NUBBLES,
WAVE BYE-BYE TO TROUBLES.

14:52.492 --> 14:55.295
YOU READY, EDDO?

14:55.362 --> 14:56.429
LET'S DO IT.

14:56.496 --> 14:58.698
OKAY.

14:58.765 --> 15:01.801
A MOMENT OF YOUR
TIME, PLEASE, NUBS.

15:01.868 --> 15:03.870
"NUBS"?

15:03.937 --> 15:07.574

UNFINISHED BUSINESS.

15:07.640 --> 15:08.608
[BELL RINGS]

15:08.675 --> 15:10.143

GET TO CLASS.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.814
THIS WILL ONLY
TAKE A SECOND.

15:14.881 --> 15:16.984
YOU STILL INTEND
TO PUBLISH THOSE PICTURES

15:17.050 --> 15:19.652
IF LAURA DOESN'T
QUIT THE RACE?

15:19.719 --> 15:21.088
I MOST CERTAINLY DO.

15:21.154 --> 15:23.890
HOW CAN I TALK YOU
OUT OF IT?

15:23.957 --> 15:25.458
WELL, LET ME THINK.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.394
NO.

15:27.460 --> 15:29.462
ARE YOU AWARE
THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING

15:29.529 --> 15:30.998
IS MORALLY REPUGNANT?

15:31.064 --> 15:33.366
WELL, SURE.

15:33.433 --> 15:36.036
ALL'S FAIR IN LOVE
AND POLITICS.

15:36.103 --> 15:39.706
OH, I'M SO GLAD
YOU SAID THAT.

15:51.651 --> 15:52.752
BLEAH!

15:52.819 --> 15:54.354
YUCK!

15:54.421 --> 15:55.422
ICK!

15:57.257 --> 15:59.359
YUCK.

MOVE FOR ME, EITHER.

16:10.337 --> 16:13.140

OF YOUR GEEKY MIND?

16:13.206 --> 16:14.774
OH, I DON'T THINK SO.

I CAN SEE
THE HEADLINES NOW--

"NUBBLES SUCKS FACE
WITH NERD."

16:21.548 --> 16:22.515
WOULD.

16:22.582 --> 16:23.550
YOU COULDN'T!

16:23.616 --> 16:24.584
COULD.

16:24.651 --> 16:25.452
BUT IT'S A LIE!

16:25.518 --> 16:27.754
YOU KISSED ME.
I DIDN'T KISS YOU.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.956

16:30.023 --> 16:32.292

WHAT THE PEOPLE BELIEVE.

YOUR PICTURES,

I WON'T PUBLISH
MINE.

TO DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES?

THAT'S JUST CRAZY
ENOUGH TO WORK.

SO SMART AFTER ALL.

WAS REALLY SMART,

17:12.332 --> 17:16.736

I COULD DO

18:04.851 --> 18:07.254

FOR ME.
