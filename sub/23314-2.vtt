WEBVTT

00:04.444 --> 00:05.743
You have to stop.

00:05.745 --> 00:08.679
I can't keep letting you put
yourself or me through this.

00:08.682 --> 00:11.882
I promise, no more.

00:11.884 --> 00:13.776
It has been nine years since

00:13.779 --> 00:15.668
I've even come close to using my powers.

00:15.671 --> 00:17.965
Do you remember why you
became Black Lightning?

00:17.968 --> 00:19.609
You wanted to give the people hope.

00:20.514 --> 00:22.007
Look, somebody has to do

00:22.010 --> 00:24.075
something, because all of this policing

00:24.078 --> 00:27.264
and marching and praying,
it hasn't changed anything.

00:32.537 --> 00:36.540
It is time that people
know that Black Lightning...

00:38.111 --> 00:39.289
is back.

00:41.316 --> 00:43.114
Previously on Black Lightning...

00:43.116 --> 00:45.182
Lynn and I are making room

00:45.184 --> 00:47.451
for a possibility of a reconciliation.

00:47.453 --> 00:50.054
All you guys want me to do
is go to school, run track,

00:50.056 --> 00:52.187
and "set a good example
for the other girls."

00:52.190 --> 00:53.858
When did that become a bad thing?

00:53.860 --> 00:56.093
Don't think just 'cause
I'm a little stoned

00:56.095 --> 00:57.345
that means you're gonna get some.

00:57.347 --> 00:59.330
I think your girl should
start putting in some work

00:59.332 --> 01:00.765
over at the Seahorse Motel.

01:00.767 --> 01:03.100
- I'm not afraid of The One Hundred.
- Bitch, you should be!

01:03.102 --> 01:04.235
Jeff, where are you going?

01:04.236 --> 01:05.403
To get our girls.

01:05.405 --> 01:06.537
Bring them home.

01:14.580 --> 01:17.681
There's no doubt that
Black Lightning is back.

01:17.683 --> 01:21.252
But the question is why? Why now?

01:21.254 --> 01:22.751
If Brother Lightning is back because

01:22.754 --> 01:24.288
he's committed to helping the people,

01:24.290 --> 01:25.827
then I'm all for it.

01:25.829 --> 01:28.492
But if he's back just for
some personal vendetta,

01:28.494 --> 01:30.561
I can't condone that.

01:30.563 --> 01:34.170
Giving the people of Freeland false hope

01:34.173 --> 01:36.867
is selfish, and it's cruel.

01:38.032 --> 01:41.738
The people of Freeland
have been victimized.

01:41.741 --> 01:45.743
I believe he is the
answer to our prayers...

02:37.663 --> 02:38.884
Oh, Jeff.

02:41.735 --> 02:44.102
I got you. Okay?

02:47.206 --> 02:50.140
I got you.

02:54.580 --> 02:57.047
Black Lightning is getting
too old for these streets.

03:00.319 --> 03:02.119
You're not lying about that.

03:02.922 --> 03:04.889
You remember when we were young...

03:05.915 --> 03:10.628
when I first saw your superpowers,
I thought you were so cool.

03:13.099 --> 03:15.165
That my man was a superhero.

03:16.536 --> 03:18.235
Not many girls could say that.

03:19.672 --> 03:21.472
Then the reality hit.

03:23.075 --> 03:27.745
And what I thought was
cool... almost destroyed us.

03:30.836 --> 03:32.535
When I see you like this, I...

03:33.700 --> 03:35.499
I feel really selfish.

03:37.156 --> 03:39.290
Hold on.

03:41.127 --> 03:42.293
I did this.

03:42.295 --> 03:45.229
No, I know. I feel like a hypocrite.

03:45.231 --> 03:48.099
I told you to go get the girls.
I put you back out there...

03:48.102 --> 03:51.669
Lynn, Black Lightning is not back.

03:52.705 --> 03:56.173
The girls are safe. I'm done.

03:59.186 --> 04:00.652
I love you, Lynn.

04:01.647 --> 04:03.280
I miss you.

04:03.282 --> 04:04.582
I miss you, too.

04:15.251 --> 04:16.260
I, um...

04:16.262 --> 04:19.196
- I should go.
- Uh, wait. Wait.

04:22.212 --> 04:24.670
I think it's important for
you to be here for the girls.

04:24.673 --> 04:27.972
So I will sleep on the
couch, you take the bed.

04:27.974 --> 04:29.673
Okay.

04:29.675 --> 04:30.908
Good night.

04:34.659 --> 04:36.225
Good night.

04:37.984 --> 04:40.060
Now they running up in
schools, taking girls?

04:40.063 --> 04:42.810
What they gonna do next? Start
taking girls out of church?

04:42.813 --> 04:45.723
If there's a war for the
streets, a war for the city,

04:45.725 --> 04:47.925
The One Hundred is winning.

04:47.927 --> 04:49.951
You know, I heard someone say

04:49.954 --> 04:52.529
that if there's a war for
the streets of Freeland,

04:52.531 --> 04:54.198
The One Hundred are winning.

04:54.200 --> 04:57.568
But here at Garfield, we are
not fighting for the streets.

04:57.570 --> 04:59.817
No, we are fighting for the minds, the

04:59.820 --> 05:02.006
hopes and the dreams of our children.

05:02.008 --> 05:04.742
Them some real pretty words, Mr. Pierce.

05:04.744 --> 05:06.977
But pretty words ain't
gonna stop The One Hundred.

05:08.314 --> 05:12.049
Dr. King said, "The arc of
the moral universe is long,

05:12.051 --> 05:15.586
but it bends toward
justice." And I believe...

05:15.588 --> 05:18.756
And they shot Dr. King
in the head, Mr. Pierce!

05:20.092 --> 05:22.548
Well, The One Hundred
got my little girl.

05:23.384 --> 05:25.162
And the police say
they can't do anything

05:25.165 --> 05:27.197
because supposedly,
there ain't no evidence

05:27.199 --> 05:29.045
she's bein' held against her will.

05:29.048 --> 05:32.036
- That's messed up, man.
- LaWanda. LaWanda White?

05:32.038 --> 05:34.038
Yeah, it's me, Mr. Pierce.

05:34.040 --> 05:35.339
It's good to see you, LaWanda.

05:35.341 --> 05:37.875
First, I'm sorry to hear about
your daughter. I really am.

05:37.877 --> 05:39.977
Well, maybe now since the
Seahorse Motel is shut down,

05:39.979 --> 05:41.645
you can take that time to reconnect.

05:41.647 --> 05:43.420
The Seahorse ain't shut down.

05:43.423 --> 05:47.051
They opened back up for business the
day after all this mess went down.

05:47.053 --> 05:50.587
And they gonna stay open as long
as they got those girls in there.

05:50.589 --> 05:52.696
Is that true?

05:57.430 --> 05:58.729
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

05:58.731 --> 06:01.498
Clearly. But, Mr. Pierce,
what I wanna know is,

06:01.500 --> 06:04.668
why Black Lightning rescued
your girls and nobody else's?

06:08.535 --> 06:10.704
I don't know, LaWanda.

06:10.707 --> 06:14.778
When I was a student here, you used
to like to use quotes to teach us.

06:14.780 --> 06:16.346
Well, I got one.

06:16.348 --> 06:20.751
"Unless all of us are free,
none of us will be free."

06:28.026 --> 06:31.019
Somebody knows who this
bootleg Black Lightning is.

06:31.022 --> 06:32.851
I want you to raise the protection

06:32.854 --> 06:36.365
amount 50% on every church and business,

06:36.368 --> 06:39.240
every crap game, massage parlor.

06:39.243 --> 06:43.340
Even rib shack. Squeeze
these darkies till they crack.

06:44.376 --> 06:47.811
Damn, boss. You really
do hate black people.

06:47.813 --> 06:51.148
No, I love black people.

06:51.150 --> 06:54.051
I hate incompetent, thick-lipped,

06:54.053 --> 06:56.887
scratch-where-it-don't-itch
Negroes like you.

06:58.390 --> 07:01.352
Y'all keep us acting
like newly-freed slaves.

07:01.355 --> 07:03.355
Boss, I got a plan for that.

07:05.831 --> 07:07.431
Perception and fear, Lala.

07:08.534 --> 07:10.300
If the people of
Freeland start to perceive

07:10.302 --> 07:13.337
we are no longer in control,
then they won't fear us.

07:13.343 --> 07:15.571
Maybe they'll start
to think that this fool

07:15.574 --> 07:18.342
pretending to be Black Lightning
will actually protect them.

07:19.378 --> 07:21.376
And I surely can't have that.

07:23.949 --> 07:25.949
Hmm.

07:25.951 --> 07:27.963
Yeah, I remember I'd have to tell you

07:27.966 --> 07:30.187
to let go of each
other and get to class.

07:30.189 --> 07:32.256
You were always holding hands.

07:32.259 --> 07:35.260
Darnell was the love of my life.

07:37.596 --> 07:42.829
When he was killed, all they
did was give us a folded flag,

07:42.832 --> 07:47.971
thanked us for his service, and
shot some guns over his casket.

07:49.008 --> 07:50.174
He deserved more.

07:50.176 --> 07:51.575
Yeah, he did.

07:53.479 --> 07:56.647
After that, our lives just fell apart.

07:59.952 --> 08:03.420
Shaquandalyn loved her daddy
more than anything in this world.

08:04.557 --> 08:07.149
I did everything I could
to try to keep her safe,

08:07.152 --> 08:09.331
but she just got caught up in looking

08:09.334 --> 08:11.397
for her daddy in all the wrong men.

08:16.302 --> 08:17.868
What can I do to help?

08:18.637 --> 08:20.195
You can go in there and get her.

08:20.198 --> 08:22.005
Take her out of there.

08:23.742 --> 08:26.476
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can.

08:26.478 --> 08:28.344
You just won't.

08:28.347 --> 08:32.475
Man, everybody knows Mr. Pierce can
do whatever he wants in Freeland.

08:32.477 --> 08:35.578
We used to call you Black Jesus,
thought you could walk on water.

08:35.582 --> 08:37.381
- Yeah, look, LaWanda...
- No.

08:39.024 --> 08:40.724
No, it's okay, Mr. Pierce.

08:41.698 --> 08:44.061
Everybody say they praying for me, but

08:44.063 --> 08:46.365
ain't nobody willing to fight for me.

08:47.128 --> 08:51.336
You got your own girls to
worry about, to fight for.

08:51.339 --> 08:55.205
Well, I got to find a
way to fight for mine.

09:02.381 --> 09:05.048
But in less than 48 hours, Henderson?

09:05.050 --> 09:08.485
Aw, come on, man. You guys
have to do better than that.

09:08.487 --> 09:09.987
It's a crime scene, Jefferson.

09:09.989 --> 09:12.656
Once we're through cleaning it
up, there's nothing else we can do.

09:12.658 --> 09:15.826
No, no, no. My girls
were kidnapped. Kidnapped!

09:15.828 --> 09:19.063
Lala's responsible, you know
this. They gave you the statement.

09:19.066 --> 09:21.832
Your girls say he was
there. He says he wasn't.

09:21.834 --> 09:24.167
And he has 15 people who
will swear he was at a party

09:24.169 --> 09:25.550
when all of this was taking place.

09:25.553 --> 09:28.372
Okay, well, you can at least bring
him in for pimping these girls out.

09:28.374 --> 09:31.041
I mean, he at the Seahorse right
now, being forced to turn tricks.

09:31.043 --> 09:33.281
Don't you think we
tried that, Jefferson?

09:33.284 --> 09:36.513
You arrest these guys, the girls say
they weren't forced to do anything.

09:36.515 --> 09:40.150
You arrest the girls, they get out
and run right back to these guys.

09:40.964 --> 09:44.888
It's not only their bodies that are
slaves to these fools, it's their minds.

09:44.890 --> 09:47.024
Okay, what about that
kid who came into school?

09:47.026 --> 09:48.225
Can you get him to flip on Lala?

09:48.227 --> 09:49.693
Yeah, maybe, if we can find him.

09:49.695 --> 09:51.061
Wait, what?

09:52.164 --> 09:54.865
What do you mean "if you can find him"?

09:54.867 --> 09:58.902
Now you telling me he just got up
and walked away from a two-story fall?

10:04.944 --> 10:06.310
How did you hear about that?

10:07.179 --> 10:09.680
My girls. My girls told me.

10:11.753 --> 10:13.487
While they were transporting him to the

10:13.490 --> 10:14.952
hospital, he jumped out the ambulance,

10:14.954 --> 10:17.754
all hyped up on
painkillers and adrenaline.

10:17.756 --> 10:20.620
He ran like a jackrabbit.
My boys couldn't catch him.

10:20.623 --> 10:24.461
You're telling me the two men
responsible for kidnapping my girls

10:24.463 --> 10:26.596
- are still out there somewhere?
- Not for long.

10:26.598 --> 10:28.532
No, my girls are witnesses, Henderson.

10:28.534 --> 10:30.220
Now, you know what that
means on the streets.

10:30.222 --> 10:33.236
I do. I got a patrol car
sitting outside your house.

10:34.139 --> 10:37.474
The key is, we find
Will, then we get Lala.

10:37.477 --> 10:38.977
I promise.

10:42.881 --> 10:44.047
Okay.

10:45.384 --> 10:47.017
Okay.

10:48.824 --> 10:50.820
We're all worried about you. You good?

10:50.823 --> 10:51.703
Yeah, I'm good.

10:51.706 --> 10:53.423
Look, it's like Fort Knox at school.

10:53.425 --> 10:55.656
There's security everywhere.

10:55.659 --> 10:58.195
When you coming back?

10:59.465 --> 11:00.864
I don't really know.

11:03.669 --> 11:05.335
- Hey, there.
- Hey.

11:07.906 --> 11:10.240
Look, I really want to see
you. Can I come by after?

11:10.242 --> 11:11.875
Uh, maybe tomorrow.

11:11.878 --> 11:13.961
It's a little bit crazy right now.

11:13.964 --> 11:15.096
All right.

11:16.335 --> 11:17.768
Y'all want to buy some candy?

11:17.771 --> 11:19.214
Yo, I gotta go.

11:20.386 --> 11:21.618
Yo, what you got, little man?

11:21.620 --> 11:23.222
Lala says hi!

11:24.923 --> 11:27.090
Oh, my...

11:33.899 --> 11:34.929
Are you okay?

11:34.932 --> 11:36.231
Are you hurt?

12:24.049 --> 12:27.952
Mr. Pierce, you came to watch
the ghetto Cirque du Soleil, huh?

12:27.955 --> 12:31.188
I hired the 12 O 'Clock Boys to
get the kids a little entertainment.

12:31.190 --> 12:32.756
Man, you better stay
away from my family.

12:32.758 --> 12:34.057
- Or what?
- "Or what?"

12:34.059 --> 12:35.625
You lucky it was just a water gun.

12:38.230 --> 12:39.874
All right, look here, we had a deal.

12:39.877 --> 12:42.679
You stay away from the
school and my girls.

12:42.682 --> 12:43.900
Things changed.

12:43.902 --> 12:46.203
Your daughters been running
their mouths to the police.

12:46.987 --> 12:50.440
Look, Mr. Pierce, I'm trying to be nice

12:50.442 --> 12:52.776
'cause you was cool with me
when I went to your school,

12:52.778 --> 12:54.978
but they better keep my
name out of their mouths.

12:54.980 --> 12:57.867
Matter of fact, if I was you,

12:57.870 --> 13:01.618
I'd send your daughters on
a long vacation before I do.

13:22.407 --> 13:25.002
Don't mistake my patience
for weakness, boy.

13:26.778 --> 13:27.811
"Boy"?

13:29.848 --> 13:32.249
Hey, man, it's been a long
minute since I've been a boy, man.

13:32.251 --> 13:35.418
Hey, man, fire the bikes back
up, man. You know what it is.

-- <font color="#138CE9">www.Addic7ed.com</font> --

13:47.709 --> 13:49.575
They went to my house!

13:49.577 --> 13:51.844
I get it, I understand.

13:52.947 --> 13:54.980
But if they had killed you,

13:54.983 --> 13:57.316
then where is the hope for this city?

13:57.318 --> 14:02.355
Gambi, I'm not trying to save the
city. I'm trying to protect my family.

14:02.357 --> 14:06.926
Okay, so get back in the suit,
and let's take these guys down.

14:06.928 --> 14:10.096
Jeff, I can access any
database, including Freeland PD.

14:10.098 --> 14:12.631
Let's just see what
information they have.

14:12.633 --> 14:15.868
If we help them find Will, he'll
tell them all he knows about Lala.

14:15.870 --> 14:18.938
Then Lala is arrested, and he'll
flip on whoever his boss is,

14:18.940 --> 14:21.659
and we can get closer to
the source of all of this.

14:23.344 --> 14:24.643
"The source"?

14:27.982 --> 14:29.382
Gambi, you're not hearing me.

14:29.384 --> 14:33.119
After I take down Lala, I'm done.

14:36.958 --> 14:38.891
Damn, I needed that.

14:38.894 --> 14:40.227
Mmm.

14:50.037 --> 14:53.739
Hey, what's up? You okay?

14:53.742 --> 14:55.542
I'm fine.

14:55.545 --> 14:57.330
Oh, believe me, I know.

14:57.333 --> 15:00.694
You so fine, you bring
sight to the blind, girl.

15:02.634 --> 15:05.284
- That was so corny.
- Whatever.

15:05.286 --> 15:07.186
You sound like an old man at the club.

15:07.188 --> 15:09.671
"Hey, girl, you so fine,

15:09.674 --> 15:12.992
- you bring sight to the blind, girl."
- I did not sound like that.

15:14.296 --> 15:17.487
Yes, you did.

15:19.767 --> 15:21.167
You sure you okay?

15:21.169 --> 15:25.471
I should be asking you that.
All that you've been through.

15:27.308 --> 15:28.808
Now is not a good time.

15:30.343 --> 15:32.729
It's never a good time.

15:32.732 --> 15:33.996
Tell me.

15:36.737 --> 15:39.952
- Our sex is mind-blowing, you know that.
- Mmm.

15:39.954 --> 15:41.987
But I need more, Anissa.

15:43.391 --> 15:45.324
I feel like I'm just
a distraction for you.

15:45.326 --> 15:48.127
We've been dating a year and
you haven't met my parents,

15:48.129 --> 15:49.460
you don't know any of my friends.

15:49.463 --> 15:52.413
I mean, babe, you know I'm busy,

15:52.416 --> 15:54.842
between school and teaching, and

15:54.845 --> 15:57.069
trying to help organize the community...

15:57.071 --> 15:59.305
I'm not asking you to
give up any of that.

15:59.307 --> 16:01.073
Well, that's what it sounds like.

16:01.076 --> 16:03.175
Look, I'm sorry.

16:03.178 --> 16:06.467
Like I said, now's not a good time,

16:06.470 --> 16:10.449
and you've been through
a lot. So, sorry.

16:10.961 --> 16:12.293
It's okay.

16:17.437 --> 16:19.337
How are you coping with all this?

16:23.865 --> 16:26.966
I don't know. It just feels weird.

16:27.935 --> 16:31.303
It all feels like a
dream or a nightmare.

16:31.305 --> 16:34.373
I don't know, I just want
everything to be back to normal,

16:34.376 --> 16:37.181
but all this strange
stuff keeps happening.

16:38.946 --> 16:41.847
Babe, you know I broke
the sink in my bathroom?

16:41.850 --> 16:43.349
You what?

16:44.552 --> 16:46.452
Yeah. The other night.

16:47.822 --> 16:49.889
So I get up to pee,

16:49.891 --> 16:53.920
and I have some kind of... panic attack.

16:53.923 --> 16:57.530
So, I grabbed the sink to
brace myself, and it just...

16:58.619 --> 17:02.167
I don't know, it just crumbled
in my hands, like it was nothing.

17:03.371 --> 17:05.570
We'll get you a good therapist.

17:05.573 --> 17:08.513
You know my mother. She's seen them all.

17:08.517 --> 17:11.210
No, babe, but the sink...
I'm just trying to...

17:11.212 --> 17:15.614
Probably just some old-ass porcelain
sink that was gonna break anyway.

17:15.616 --> 17:17.148
Look, the important thing is,

17:17.151 --> 17:20.719
we find you someone that is
gonna help you get through this.

17:23.103 --> 17:26.037
It'll be okay. Hey.

17:38.839 --> 17:40.906
Evening, neighbor.

17:40.908 --> 17:42.675
You're working late.

17:42.677 --> 17:44.243
And it don't stop.

17:44.245 --> 17:47.179
Yeah, said every hype
man ever stood on a stage.

17:47.181 --> 17:50.158
Exactly. Besides, I was walking Monk,

17:50.161 --> 17:53.186
and he suggested we check in
to make sure you guys are okay.

17:53.189 --> 17:57.095
Yeah, well, Anissa's, uh,
with her girlfriend, uh...

17:57.098 --> 17:59.098
Jennifer's upstairs, asleep.

18:00.428 --> 18:02.294
They're more resilient than I thought.

18:02.296 --> 18:04.396
People usually are.

18:05.700 --> 18:07.199
Oh, thanks.

18:07.202 --> 18:09.486
Oh, you're welcome.

18:09.489 --> 18:10.855
Hey, uh...

18:12.139 --> 18:13.238
Lynn still here?

18:16.444 --> 18:18.711
Yes, Henderson, she is still here.

18:18.713 --> 18:20.830
She's upstairs, asleep with Jennifer.

18:20.833 --> 18:23.983
Negro, don't act all stoic on me.

18:23.985 --> 18:25.236
I know you.

18:25.239 --> 18:28.387
You probably in there tap-dancing,
you so happy she's back.

18:28.389 --> 18:30.889
Yeah, well, well, she's
not back completely...

18:32.259 --> 18:33.892
but I think we're getting close.

18:33.894 --> 18:36.762
Yeah, I'm happy to hear that, man.
You all deserve some happiness.

18:36.764 --> 18:39.233
And we gonna get these guys, Jefferson.

18:39.236 --> 18:41.700
Will, Lala, we'll get 'em.

18:42.870 --> 18:44.056
Yeah, I know.

18:44.059 --> 18:47.973
Oh, by the way, you might
wanna talk to your girl LaWanda.

18:47.975 --> 18:51.276
She posted herself up outside
the Seahorse with a camera,

18:51.278 --> 18:53.612
recording johns

18:53.614 --> 18:56.115
and taking down license plate numbers.

18:56.117 --> 18:58.517
I tried to talk to her, but
she just called me an Uncle Tom

18:58.519 --> 19:00.552
and walked away. She
gonna get herself killed.

19:00.554 --> 19:02.354
What are you gonna do about it?

19:03.224 --> 19:05.501
There's nothing I can
do. She got rights.

19:06.139 --> 19:07.772
Come on, boy.

20:07.755 --> 20:09.888
This is why I don't like hiring family.

20:09.890 --> 20:12.758
They never appreciate nothing
you try and do for 'em.

20:14.462 --> 20:17.496
You got me in a world
of confusion, cuzo.

20:19.133 --> 20:21.658
But at the end of the day...

20:25.106 --> 20:26.739
I'll straighten it out.

20:56.963 --> 20:58.730
Thanks for getting the word out.

20:58.732 --> 21:01.166
- Sure. Okay, you're welcome.
- LaWanda.

21:01.168 --> 21:04.235
- LaWanda, you gotta stop this.
- No, I don't.

21:04.237 --> 21:06.071
This is suicide.

21:06.073 --> 21:09.107
Now, as soon as all these reporters
leave, when this story gets old,

21:09.776 --> 21:12.220
The One Hundred will kill you.

21:12.223 --> 21:14.663
Would you die for your
daughters, Mr. Pierce?

21:14.666 --> 21:17.816
Would you just walk away if
Black Lightning hadn't saved 'em?

21:17.818 --> 21:19.384
Huh?

21:20.921 --> 21:22.587
That's what I thought.

21:25.459 --> 21:29.094
LaWanda, no, don't do this.
Okay? Forty-eight hours.

21:29.096 --> 21:32.030
Just give me 48 hours.

21:32.032 --> 21:34.065
I promise you, I will
get your daughter back.

21:34.067 --> 21:35.700
I have connections at
the police department.

21:35.702 --> 21:38.085
No. Didn't you hear me?
They ain't trying to listen!

21:38.088 --> 21:41.173
No, they will listen to me, I promise.

21:41.176 --> 21:43.174
We will find a way.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.976
But none of that is gonna matter

21:44.978 --> 21:48.813
if your daughter comes home
safe and her mother's dead.

21:52.085 --> 21:54.119
I love my daughter, Mr. Pierce.

21:56.656 --> 21:58.223
She's all I got.

21:58.792 --> 22:00.125
I know how you feel.

22:00.694 --> 22:02.660
Believe me.

22:03.163 --> 22:04.963
So, let me help you.

22:07.434 --> 22:10.335
Okay. I'll stop.

22:11.471 --> 22:14.569
But I ain't leaving.
I'll just sit in my car.

22:14.572 --> 22:16.608
I ain't taking my eyes off this place,

22:16.610 --> 22:19.010
just in case they try to take
her somewhere I can't find her.

22:19.746 --> 22:22.180
Okay, fair enough. Thank you.

22:22.182 --> 22:25.150
And I promise you, I won't let you down.

22:27.705 --> 22:29.038
Thank you.

22:40.567 --> 22:43.034
Ooh. I'm sorry.

22:45.939 --> 22:47.405
Damn.

22:47.407 --> 22:49.808
Well, it is good to see you, girl.

22:49.810 --> 22:51.676
It's good to see you, too.

22:51.678 --> 22:53.244
Thanks for coming.

22:54.147 --> 22:57.115
Aight, so... so Black Lightning, huh?

22:57.117 --> 22:59.384
I mean, you saw Black Lightning?

22:59.386 --> 23:02.153
Girl, that... Yo, that is pretty cool.

23:03.089 --> 23:04.322
Yeah.

23:05.592 --> 23:06.814
I was kind of scared

23:06.817 --> 23:09.858
because when you try and
look at his face, it hurts.

23:09.861 --> 23:12.530
I don't know, it's like
looking into a spotlight.

23:12.532 --> 23:15.467
There's something that's out of focus.

23:17.637 --> 23:18.736
J...

23:20.707 --> 23:23.608
Look, when all this went
down, I realized something.

23:23.610 --> 23:25.009
What's that?

23:26.446 --> 23:30.515
I mean, you know that we've
been friends for a long time.

23:30.518 --> 23:32.111
And, uh...

23:35.922 --> 23:37.322
Thought I'd maybe...

23:37.325 --> 23:40.826
I've been wanting to
ask you to be my girl.

23:41.661 --> 23:44.729
And, you know, I realized...

23:44.731 --> 23:46.566
That if they had killed you, I mean,

23:46.569 --> 23:48.502
I never would've had the chance and...

23:51.852 --> 23:53.519
Well, now I'm doing it.

23:54.975 --> 23:56.541
Do you, maybe, wanna...

23:56.544 --> 23:58.544
You want to be my girlfriend?

24:03.316 --> 24:05.049
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

24:05.919 --> 24:07.986
Yeah. Cool. I'd like that.

24:07.988 --> 24:09.721
All right. Cool. Thanks.

24:09.723 --> 24:13.091
Uh... Well, look, I
kinda got you something.

24:13.093 --> 24:16.752
It's not fancy, but I saw it
and thought about you, so...

24:21.434 --> 24:23.101
That looks good on you.

24:24.337 --> 24:25.603
Thank you.

24:50.298 --> 24:54.374
Oh. Hey. I didn't hear you come in.

24:54.377 --> 24:56.968
- Huh.
- You want me to make you something to eat?

24:56.970 --> 24:59.237
No, no, I'm fine. Thank you.

25:00.106 --> 25:02.407
So, uh, how are the girls?

25:02.409 --> 25:06.177
Good. Jennifer is on the roof in
her favorite place with Khalil.

25:06.179 --> 25:08.112
- So, she's happy.
- Mmm.

25:08.114 --> 25:10.982
And Anissa's still at
her girlfriend's house.

25:10.984 --> 25:13.484
And I can never remember
that girl's name.

25:14.854 --> 25:17.221
Cheena, I think.

25:17.223 --> 25:20.325
What? Nothing like that. No.

25:23.538 --> 25:25.736
Well, it feels good to have you here.

25:26.600 --> 25:27.999
It feels good to be here.

25:28.001 --> 25:29.534
Yeah.

25:34.407 --> 25:36.074
Mmm.

25:48.989 --> 25:50.488
That feels good.

25:50.491 --> 25:55.059
Well, there's one, uh,
fact that I lean on.

25:55.062 --> 25:56.461
Yeah?

25:57.423 --> 26:02.033
That I love you and those girls
more than anything in the world.

26:04.971 --> 26:07.171
I need to take things slow, Jeff.

26:08.189 --> 26:10.319
As a neuroscientist, I know everything

26:10.322 --> 26:12.545
there is to know about the brain,

26:12.548 --> 26:15.580
but not so much about the heart.

26:19.219 --> 26:22.520
Oh, that's a smooth line, lady. Yeah.

26:46.379 --> 26:48.212
Sorry, Mr. Pierce.

26:49.683 --> 26:50.948
Lala.

26:53.720 --> 26:55.748
You better take that
camera out of my face.

26:55.751 --> 26:58.607
LaWanda, take your ass home now.
I'm not playing no games with you.

26:58.610 --> 27:00.224
- I want my daughter.
- Hey!

27:00.226 --> 27:03.428
I want my daughter. No,
get your hands off me!

27:07.200 --> 27:10.968
Man! Come on, babe. I ain't
got time for this, man.

27:41.449 --> 27:42.714
Hey, man, what's up?

27:42.717 --> 27:44.420
Jeff, um...

27:44.422 --> 27:46.811
I didn't want you to
hear it on the news.

27:46.814 --> 27:47.990
LaWanda's dead.

27:47.993 --> 27:50.311
I just got the call a few minutes ago.

27:51.932 --> 27:53.665
Sorry, man.

28:09.780 --> 28:11.380
A local woman was found dead...

28:11.382 --> 28:13.248
What good did it do, Lynn?

28:15.214 --> 28:16.880
She was my student.

28:19.590 --> 28:22.831
I had a fantasy that when

28:22.834 --> 28:25.127
they leave me, their lives are better.

28:25.129 --> 28:27.296
That they could transcend

28:27.298 --> 28:31.615
this neighborhood, this city, world.

28:31.618 --> 28:36.071
Yeah, I saved more lives as
the principal of Garfield High

28:36.073 --> 28:37.573
than I ever did as Black Lightning.

28:37.575 --> 28:39.208
- It's true.
- It's a lie!

28:39.210 --> 28:41.043
- LaWanda is dead.
- She is.

28:41.045 --> 28:42.411
I know. I know.

28:42.413 --> 28:45.347
And it hurts, and I
understand. I feel it, too...

28:45.349 --> 28:47.076
But I could have saved her.

28:48.517 --> 28:50.865
I could save so many.

28:54.291 --> 28:56.024
I've been living a lie.

28:56.026 --> 28:59.228
Living in the hopes that
you and me and the girls

28:59.230 --> 29:01.797
could somehow live behind
a white picket fence,

29:01.799 --> 29:03.031
a normal life!

29:03.033 --> 29:07.169
I'm not normal. Never
have been. Never will be.

29:07.171 --> 29:10.305
Jeff, listen to me. This
is the addiction talking...

29:10.307 --> 29:12.574
What? There is no damn addiction!

29:15.946 --> 29:18.729
Do you remember what you said

29:18.732 --> 29:20.883
when we discovered my powers?

29:20.886 --> 29:24.653
You said it was a gift.

29:24.656 --> 29:27.232
A blessing from God.

29:29.026 --> 29:30.792
It's still a gift.

29:33.280 --> 29:35.480
It's still a blessing from God.

29:39.035 --> 29:40.802
And I intend to use it.

29:42.725 --> 29:44.172
Not just for the girls,

29:44.174 --> 29:47.209
but for all the other
people out there who need me.

29:47.211 --> 29:49.717
Jefferson, please, we are so close

29:49.720 --> 29:52.917
to putting the pieces of
our lives back together.

29:55.460 --> 29:57.460
Yeah, we are.

29:59.357 --> 30:00.689
Maybe.

30:00.692 --> 30:02.592
No more maybes for me, Lynn.

30:04.084 --> 30:09.097
It is time that people know
that Black Lightning is back.

30:18.954 --> 30:20.787
Morning.

30:20.790 --> 30:22.642
Welcome back. I mean, let's be honest,

30:22.645 --> 30:24.588
you never kept your eyes off this place,

30:24.591 --> 30:26.391
but just making it official.

30:27.227 --> 30:28.860
Thank you.

30:28.862 --> 30:32.030
- How are the girls holding up?
- As best they can.

30:32.032 --> 30:35.533
Yeah, I think getting back into
the school routine will help.

30:35.535 --> 30:37.888
Mmm. How are you holding up?

30:37.891 --> 30:39.871
I'm good.

30:39.873 --> 30:42.240
Look, I see you keeping
everything and everyone together.

30:42.242 --> 30:45.443
I just hope someone is
doing the same for you.

30:45.446 --> 30:50.173
I mean, if you need to
talk or whatever, I'm here.

30:51.618 --> 30:54.118
Thank you, Kara. I appreciate it.

30:54.650 --> 30:56.082
Yeah.

31:03.829 --> 31:05.330
- Hey.
- Good news.

31:05.333 --> 31:06.899
I found Will.

31:06.902 --> 31:09.641
Bad news, he's dead.

31:09.644 --> 31:11.452
I got here before the
police, and whoever

31:11.455 --> 31:13.498
killed him didn't take his cell phone.

31:13.501 --> 31:16.808
Mobile phones are the enemy of bad
guys. When are they gonna learn?

31:16.810 --> 31:18.543
Lala's still out there on the loose,

31:18.545 --> 31:20.878
and he's getting desperate,
Gambi. He killed LaWanda.

31:21.680 --> 31:24.782
He's gonna come after my girls
next if we don't get to him first.

31:24.784 --> 31:26.584
We will.

31:37.007 --> 31:39.477
- Give me some more. Give me some more.
- Okay, okay, okay.

31:39.480 --> 31:41.146
Hey, YOLO.

31:41.149 --> 31:43.583
It's the truth, you only live once.

31:43.586 --> 31:47.205
Yeah, 'cause one minute your ass
can be here, everything's cool,

31:47.208 --> 31:49.243
and then the next minute,
your ass is kidnapped.

31:49.246 --> 31:50.792
Yeah, but they should have different

31:50.795 --> 31:52.609
terms for it. I'm not a kid anymore.

31:52.612 --> 31:54.912
They should call it teen-napped.

31:54.914 --> 31:57.548
And Anissa would be adult-napped.

31:57.550 --> 31:59.584
Okay, did they hit you hard
in the head or something,

31:59.586 --> 32:01.919
because you tripping a little bit.

32:01.921 --> 32:03.066
You trippin'.

32:03.069 --> 32:05.323
- Really?
- Yeah, you need some more of that.

32:05.325 --> 32:06.824
No. Right.

32:08.228 --> 32:10.910
It's strong, it's good.

32:24.744 --> 32:25.810
Hi.

32:27.080 --> 32:28.546
Oh, what you doing here?

32:29.215 --> 32:30.581
YOLO.

32:30.583 --> 32:31.949
What?

32:31.951 --> 32:33.618
You only live once.

32:38.331 --> 32:39.930
What, so you drinking now?

32:39.933 --> 32:41.166
At school?

32:42.234 --> 32:43.467
It's not cool, J.

32:43.470 --> 32:46.237
Khalil, calm down. I just
wanted to ask you something.

32:46.240 --> 32:48.188
Look, I'm not gonna calm down.

32:48.191 --> 32:51.736
Look, you saw and went through
some craziness. I get it.

32:51.738 --> 32:53.871
But that is not the way to deal with it.

32:56.886 --> 32:58.519
I've seen it all, J.

32:59.933 --> 33:01.845
My brother shot and killed,

33:01.848 --> 33:05.817
father in jail, Mama working
her damn ass off just to provide.

33:06.820 --> 33:08.686
Yeah, I live the life
that rappers talk about,

33:08.689 --> 33:11.456
and ain't none of it cute. None of it.

33:11.458 --> 33:14.683
But you know what? God gave me a gift.

33:14.686 --> 33:16.542
I can run fast.

33:16.545 --> 33:18.763
So I'm gonna run my black
ass straight up out of here,

33:18.765 --> 33:20.264
and I ain't looking back.

33:23.103 --> 33:27.972
But I want you to come
with me, but not like this.

33:27.974 --> 33:30.621
No, that is going backwards
and I can't do that.

33:32.769 --> 33:35.236
I just see the world
completely different now.

33:35.893 --> 33:37.393
Oh, I got you.

33:38.433 --> 33:40.952
Really, I do.

33:40.955 --> 33:43.254
It's just growing up.

33:43.256 --> 33:44.555
Come here, J.

33:51.625 --> 33:54.652
I forgot how warm and
beautiful this place is.

33:56.770 --> 33:58.536
You know how this ends, right?

33:58.539 --> 34:01.238
The same way it always
ends for everyone, Lynn.

34:01.241 --> 34:02.640
None of us get out of here alive.

34:02.642 --> 34:05.209
- He was happy.
- But what kind of happy?

34:05.211 --> 34:07.496
Happy like a lion in a cage?

34:07.499 --> 34:09.547
King of the zoo, not of the jungle?

34:09.549 --> 34:12.953
Happy like a man who was at
peace just being Jefferson Pierce.

34:12.956 --> 34:16.420
But he isn't just Jefferson Pierce,
he is so much more than that.

34:16.422 --> 34:18.088
And you know that better than anyone.

34:18.091 --> 34:19.554
I do, and that's why I want you to

34:19.556 --> 34:21.225
stop him before he gets addicted again.

34:21.226 --> 34:23.060
We have a difference of opinion on that.

34:23.062 --> 34:25.929
I don't believe Jefferson was
ever addicted to his powers.

34:25.931 --> 34:28.431
He was in a war to save
this city and its people,

34:28.434 --> 34:29.583
and he was winning.

34:29.585 --> 34:32.570
Then he suddenly stopped
because he was addicted to you.

34:32.572 --> 34:34.219
And now look at the
condition of this city

34:34.221 --> 34:36.217
and its people. It's...
it's complete chaos.

34:36.219 --> 34:38.993
- Sounds like you're blaming me for the chaos.
- A little.

34:38.996 --> 34:41.344
Just like you blame me, then and now.

34:41.353 --> 34:45.322
But ultimately, it is Jefferson's
choice what he does with his powers.

35:04.490 --> 35:06.223
Hey.

35:06.226 --> 35:07.905
Will's phone had Lala's

35:07.908 --> 35:10.074
address on it. I ve got him on my GPS.

35:22.337 --> 35:24.087
Ooh, he is fine.

35:28.907 --> 35:30.740
Black Lightning, my man.

35:30.743 --> 35:32.746
- Lala, what floor?
- Penthouse.

35:32.748 --> 35:34.165
Thanks, bro.

35:40.689 --> 35:41.955
I got you.

35:41.957 --> 35:44.157
No. I'm gonna take the stairs.

35:45.751 --> 35:47.660
I'm just getting back into this.

35:48.321 --> 35:50.417
A brother needs all
the exercise he can get.

36:44.252 --> 36:47.915
Stop! Put your hands
high above your head!

36:51.493 --> 36:53.026
It's been a while, Inspector.

37:08.677 --> 37:11.537
I don't want to spend
a lot of time on this,

37:11.540 --> 37:13.179
so I'll make it plain.

37:14.850 --> 37:20.653
LaWanda is telling her
story from the dead, buddy.

37:22.143 --> 37:25.678
Her cell phone was recording, so
we got you on tape shooting her.

37:29.287 --> 37:30.935
Your boy is flipping on you.

37:30.938 --> 37:32.799
How you think we found you?

37:34.587 --> 37:36.102
Mmm-hmm.

37:39.007 --> 37:41.883
Your world is falling apart, Lala.

38:02.063 --> 38:05.198
It's over. The girls are safe.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.367
And the Seahorse has been shut down.

38:07.369 --> 38:08.635
And Black Lightning?

38:10.739 --> 38:14.207
Look, things are different now.

38:14.209 --> 38:16.130
The girls are older.

38:16.133 --> 38:18.422
Maybe we can find a way to live with it.

39:15.770 --> 39:18.339
On the counter! Hurry!
Come on! Come on, hurry up!

39:18.342 --> 39:19.990
Put it on the counter! Come on, hurry!

39:19.993 --> 39:22.337
Hurry up! On the ground, bitch!

39:22.340 --> 39:24.176
You stay! You keep doing
what you were doing.

39:24.179 --> 39:27.026
I said on the ground.
Are you deaf, bitch?

39:27.029 --> 39:30.030
- Okay.
- I will shoot you!

39:30.033 --> 39:32.585
Get down!

40:07.860 --> 40:10.156
Yeah, we were close, Lynn.

40:30.578 --> 40:32.045
What's up?

40:53.134 --> 40:54.594
Have fun.

41:08.678 --> 41:10.311
Lala.

41:12.420 --> 41:14.821
You shot somebody's mama?

41:16.791 --> 41:19.157
Any man that'd do that has no morals.

41:20.266 --> 41:22.107
No principles to live by.

41:22.110 --> 41:25.064
Which means there's nothing
you are not capable of,

41:25.066 --> 41:27.133
including becoming a rat.
