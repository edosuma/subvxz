It's too late.
And even if it isn't,

Battered spouse means
she had intent, which is
different than accident.

whether she did it
on purpose or not...

33:38.736 --> 33:41.536
and that whole
"so help you God" part"--
that's it.

33:41.603 --> 33:44.136
That's what?
That's our closing.

33:44.203 --> 33:46.336
What are you talking about?

33:46.403 --> 33:48.403
Well, could it be true?
Could it be?

33:48.469 --> 33:52.203
All I can say is,
I've never gotten
any mandate.

33:52.269 --> 33:54.236
But you haven't had
any cases against us.

33:54.303 --> 33:56.203

with me.

33:56.269 --> 33:58.303
Bobby, let's face it.

34:00.569 --> 34:03.003
Your firm has pissed
this office off.

34:03.069 --> 34:05.336
That Joey Heric case
made you a target.

34:05.403 --> 34:08.003
And when those
police officers got killed--

34:08.069 --> 34:11.436
For me,
as far as my office goes,

34:11.503 --> 34:13.469
I'm sleeping with the enemy.

34:13.536 --> 34:16.036
The day I stop
winning my cases, I'm gone.

34:16.103 --> 34:19.203
Because of me?
Because of you.

34:22.503 --> 34:24.668
Little common sense here, folks.

34:24.735 --> 34:26.636
She wanted him dead.

34:26.703 --> 34:30.569
She stood to inherit everything
if he died.

34:30.636 --> 34:34.268
She threatened to kill him
in a dangerous sex scene.

34:34.335 --> 34:36.636
These aren't just things
we put into evidence.

34:36.703 --> 34:39.136
These are things
she flat-out admits.

34:39.203 --> 34:41.603
Sara Katlin told you all this.

34:41.668 --> 34:43.603
You don't wanna believe me?
Believe her.

34:43.668 --> 34:46.436
Of course she intended
to kill him.

34:46.503 --> 34:49.668
And even if you should
somehow want to resist
that conclusion,

34:49.735 --> 34:53.936
you simply cannot escape
her guilt for murder
in the second degree.

34:54.003 --> 34:56.703
For murder two,
all she need have...

34:56.768 --> 35:02.269
is an awareness
of an unjustifiably high risk
to human life...

35:02.336 --> 35:04.769
and she basically
admitted that too,
didn't she?

35:04.836 --> 35:07.236
Ladies and gentlemen,

35:07.303 --> 35:09.203
if you don't wanna believe me,

35:09.269 --> 35:11.303
please, believe her.

35:20.436 --> 35:23.403
Well, it would be easy
to dismiss her, wouldn't it?

35:23.469 --> 35:26.669
Porno queen--
We all saw what she does
for a living.

35:26.736 --> 35:29.703
And whatever character traits
you want to attach to her,

35:29.769 --> 35:32.536
integrity really
isn't the first one
that comes to mind.

35:32.603 --> 35:35.569
Not that this is at all
relevant,

35:35.636 --> 35:39.269
but when I watched the footage,
I was disgusted.

35:39.336 --> 35:42.169
But every defendant
gets his or her
day in court,

35:42.236 --> 35:45.603
and as her lawyer
it is my job to present
her side of the story.

35:45.669 --> 35:51.236
And since we came in today
armed only with her word, well--

35:51.303 --> 35:54.269
What could
her word be worth?

35:54.336 --> 35:57.003
Turns out, quite a bit.

35:57.069 --> 35:58.969
So much so
that the prosecutor...

35:59.036 --> 36:02.569
<i>just stood before you</i>
<i>and asked you</i>
<i>to believe her.</i>

36:03.703 --> 36:05.536
Believe her.

36:05.603 --> 36:07.603
And the reason
he made that argument...

36:07.669 --> 36:10.403
is because of all the things
that jumped out
during this trial,

36:10.469 --> 36:14.069
the most conspicuous
was her truthfulness.

36:14.136 --> 36:16.003
She didn't hide a damn thing.

36:16.069 --> 36:19.636
She got up
on that witness chair,
and to her own detriment,

36:19.703 --> 36:22.536
she told the truth.

36:22.603 --> 36:25.636
Admitted she hated her husband.
Admitted she wanted him dead.

36:25.703 --> 36:29.436
Even admitted that
she was glad when he died.

36:31.069 --> 36:35.936
Now, nobody--
not me, not him,

36:36.003 --> 36:38.036
and I suspect, not even you--

36:38.103 --> 36:41.536
ever expected that much
truth from her.

36:43.036 --> 36:44.903
But what did she say...

36:44.969 --> 36:48.636
when asked whether or not
she intended to kill
her husband?

36:48.703 --> 36:51.503
She said no.

36:51.569 --> 36:54.403
And when asked
was she so reckless...

36:54.469 --> 36:56.903
that she should have foreseen
that he might die,

36:56.969 --> 36:59.436
she did not admit that.

36:59.503 --> 37:01.636
She said, "I don't know."

37:01.703 --> 37:04.736
That was honest.

37:04.803 --> 37:07.403
She didn't know.

37:07.469 --> 37:09.636
That is reasonable doubt,
ladies and gentlemen.

37:09.703 --> 37:11.569
She didn't know.

37:12.969 --> 37:16.903
And her doubt...
is also your doubt,

37:16.969 --> 37:19.869
if you take her
at her word.

37:19.936 --> 37:23.336
So I'm gonna ask you
to go back into that room,
and I am gonna...

37:23.403 --> 37:25.269
make the same request
that he just made.
