WEBVTT

00:16.308 --> 00:17.309
Coming out!

00:34.952 --> 00:36.036
What the hell?

00:41.083 --> 00:42.501
Don't hurt 'em, Miss Liz.

00:44.586 --> 00:46.380
Thank you!

00:48.090 --> 00:50.217
- The AC guy call back yet?
- Nope.

00:50.300 --> 00:53.178
Unbelievable. One more hour
and I try to fix it myself.

00:59.935 --> 01:01.353
Holy fucking shit!

01:06.441 --> 01:07.943
Come on, people. Energy up!

01:09.236 --> 01:12.906
Rib cage! Shoulders down, everyone!

01:17.369 --> 01:18.412
Hello?

01:18.996 --> 01:19.997
This is she.

01:21.123 --> 01:22.249
Are you serious?

01:24.251 --> 01:25.419
Yes!

01:30.257 --> 01:34.469
Over 150 local organizations
were shocked this morning

01:34.553 --> 01:37.973
when they received generous financial
gifts from billionaire Molly Wells.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.725
Wells is using her immense wealth

01:39.808 --> 01:42.436
to fund Southern California
outreach programs.

01:42.519 --> 01:45.898
The gifts were unsolicited
and caught the recipients by surprise.

01:45.981 --> 01:49.860
This money is going to improve the lives
of so many LGBTQ youth.

01:49.943 --> 01:51.528
I can't believe this happened to us.

01:51.612 --> 01:52.696
I'm so thankful!

01:55.324 --> 01:58.660
<i>The former wife
of CEO John Novak said in a statement</i>

01:58.744 --> 02:01.288
<i>that this morning's activity is
just a start,</i>

02:01.371 --> 02:03.665
<i>and more financial help is on the way.</i>

02:03.749 --> 02:05.918
<i>Quite a nice day
for these deserving folks.</i>

02:06.001 --> 02:07.669
Wow.

02:08.753 --> 02:12.007
Congratulations, you guys.
Molly, I gotta hand it to you.

02:12.090 --> 02:14.301
These surprise donations
were a genius idea.

02:14.384 --> 02:15.594
Thanks.

02:15.677 --> 02:19.389
It's a new feeling to be watching myself
on TV for something positive.

02:19.473 --> 02:22.726
I am so proud of us, guys.
Cheers, everyone!

02:23.727 --> 02:27.022
<i>In other news, 18 severed feet were found
in a basement in Ohio…</i>

02:27.105 --> 02:30.234
No, no, no. Don't cheers to that.
Cheers to the thing before.

03:20.576 --> 03:23.370
Oh, my God. Molly. Molly. Mol--
This is huge.

03:23.453 --> 03:25.539
I've got some good news,
and I've got some bad news.

03:25.622 --> 03:28.125
The good news is
we got invited to a super fancy party.

03:28.208 --> 03:31.211
- Well, what's the bad news?
- Everyone here got invited too.

03:32.212 --> 03:37.092
I'm being recognized for something
the "Philanthropic Humanitarian Awards"?

03:37.176 --> 03:38.927
The Mannies? For real?

03:39.011 --> 03:42.931
Yeah. It says I'm receiving
the "Marjorie Pendleton Foster Award."

03:43.015 --> 03:44.433
Who's that?

03:44.516 --> 03:46.310
She was a famous philanthropist.

03:46.393 --> 03:49.229
She used her family's oil fortune
to build a lot of orphanages.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.607
Before throwing herself
in front of a train.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.693
Who cares about any of that?

03:54.776 --> 03:57.404
It's a black-tie affair at a fancy hotel.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.156
I mean, we're back.

03:59.239 --> 04:01.408
Wow. The celebration is catered.

04:01.491 --> 04:04.286
A vegetarian option.
Well, that's considerate of them.

04:04.369 --> 04:07.497
It says they have lobster and prime rib.

04:07.581 --> 04:09.249
I mean, I love surfboard turf.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.877
You know, I've been to plenty
of award ceremonies,

04:11.960 --> 04:14.546
but it was always
because John was winning something.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.130
I mean, I'm happy for you.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.509
But should we be going
to the Mannies though?

04:18.591 --> 04:21.011
What? Why are you like this? Why?

04:21.094 --> 04:22.513
I mean, it's kind of messed up

04:22.596 --> 04:26.099
to watch a bunch of billionaires
give each other golden statues.

04:29.353 --> 04:31.104
But we've been working really hard.

04:31.897 --> 04:33.899
And who doesn't like a free prime rib?

04:33.982 --> 04:35.192
Then it's settled.

04:35.275 --> 04:38.111
We're dressing up. We're eating lobster.

04:38.195 --> 04:40.072
We are going to a fancy party

04:40.155 --> 04:42.449
to celebrate putting
this shitty year behind me!

04:42.533 --> 04:45.577
- Okay, but let's remember that--
- No! You will not ruin this for me.

04:45.661 --> 04:48.664
Okay. It's okay. We're going.
It's okay, baby. It's okay.

04:48.747 --> 04:49.873
Go, go.

04:49.957 --> 04:50.832
I know. We're going.

04:51.875 --> 04:54.670
It's okay. It's okay. I know.

04:55.546 --> 04:57.589
You really think I can pull this off?

04:57.673 --> 05:00.634
I have never been more sure
of anything in my life.

05:01.426 --> 05:03.262
Okay. I'm coming out.

05:07.975 --> 05:11.019
Oh, my God. This is everything.

05:11.103 --> 05:14.648
You are a phoenix rising out of the ashes.

05:14.731 --> 05:16.066
You look so beautiful in this,

05:16.149 --> 05:18.277
you are this close
to penetrating my gay seal.

05:18.360 --> 05:19.611
It does feel good, you know,

05:19.695 --> 05:22.698
being recognized for something
other than just being divorced.

05:22.781 --> 05:24.616
Yeah. And you deserve it.

05:24.700 --> 05:26.660
- How's the speech coming along?
- Great.

05:28.078 --> 05:31.248
"As many of you know,
I've been through a lot this year.

05:31.915 --> 05:35.169
And in that journey,
I have found a way to mend.

05:35.711 --> 05:39.882
Philanthropy is, at its core,
all about healing others.

05:40.757 --> 05:44.261
But it's also about healing myself."

05:45.846 --> 05:48.140
Oh, my God! Powerful, much?

05:48.223 --> 05:50.642
- Did you write this?
- Oh, God. No. I hired a speechwriter.

05:50.726 --> 05:53.103
I mean, look at me in this dress.
Do I look like a writer?

05:53.187 --> 05:55.355
- No, you don't. And thank God for that.
- Right?

05:55.439 --> 05:56.565
Can you imagine?

05:57.316 --> 05:59.818
"I think the comma should go over there,
not here."

05:59.902 --> 06:01.195
"Words, words, words.

06:01.278 --> 06:03.238
I have no way
of communicating with people."

06:03.322 --> 06:05.741
"Let's workshop this piece
I'm working on right now."

06:05.824 --> 06:06.950
Oh, God. That's too real.

06:07.034 --> 06:08.994
- I took it too far.
- Yeah.

07:03.465 --> 07:04.466
Wow.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.718
This is the coolest thing
I've ever been to.

07:07.886 --> 07:09.930
Alex wants proof that I'm actually here.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.101
- Oh, my God.
- What?

07:14.810 --> 07:17.187
That is Martin Streibler.

07:17.771 --> 07:19.147
Oh, man.

07:19.231 --> 07:20.649
What a cool feeling…

07:20.732 --> 07:23.110
for someone who knows
who Martin Streibler is.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.112
He founded the software company

07:25.195 --> 07:27.698
that revolutionized accounting
back in the '90s.

07:27.781 --> 07:30.742
I mean, he's like the LeBron James
of number crunching.

07:30.826 --> 07:33.412
Sorry, I don't know
if you're a sports guy. LeBron James--

07:33.495 --> 07:35.706
Look, I appreciate you
not making assumptions,

07:35.789 --> 07:37.457
but I know who LeBron James is.

07:37.541 --> 07:38.542
Okay.

07:38.625 --> 07:39.918
All right.

07:40.002 --> 07:41.253
Let's go say hi to Martin.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.881
Wait, what? Hang on. Are you kidding?

07:43.964 --> 07:44.840
No. Why not?

07:44.923 --> 07:47.759
The guy is, like, a billionaire.
We can't just walk up to him. Right?

07:47.843 --> 07:50.971
Sure we can. I mean,
this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.848
Let's go.

08:01.315 --> 08:03.066
Pardon me. I do not mean to interrupt

08:03.150 --> 08:07.196
what appears to be a very lively
and lovely conversation, but--

08:07.279 --> 08:08.614
Are you Martin Streibler?

08:08.697 --> 08:09.698
Yes, I am.

08:10.282 --> 08:14.745
Well, sir, I have your number-one fan
right over here.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.792
- Say hello.
- Hello.

08:26.840 --> 08:30.385
- Where is this bartender?
- I don't know. It's been a while.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.847
Here I am. So sorry to make you wait.

08:34.932 --> 08:35.974
What can I get for you?

08:36.058 --> 08:38.894
Could I please have a tequila
and a Diet Sprite with five cherries

08:38.977 --> 08:40.770
- and a little bit of--
- Oh, Lord, no.

08:40.854 --> 08:44.274
We will have two vodka martinis,
dry as a bone, with a twist.

08:45.442 --> 08:46.443
Excellent choice.

08:48.070 --> 08:49.655
He's very handsome.

08:56.578 --> 08:57.913
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

09:01.291 --> 09:04.169
It this what all martinis taste like?
This vodka is incredible.

09:04.253 --> 09:06.255
Right? That's my favorite brand.

09:07.172 --> 09:10.008
Wait. Are you Jean-Pierre Voland?

09:10.092 --> 09:11.093
I am.

09:11.802 --> 09:14.763
I saw you waiting,
so I had to do something.

09:14.847 --> 09:18.517
This man might just be as rich as you,
and he's a huge philanthropist.

09:18.600 --> 09:20.602
His family owns the company
that makes this vodka.

09:21.687 --> 09:24.231
Believe it or not, that baby is me.

09:24.898 --> 09:27.192
My grandfather put me on the bottle.
I don't know why.

09:27.276 --> 09:29.361
Maybe because you were
such a handsome baby?

09:30.237 --> 09:31.405
I'm Sofia.

09:31.488 --> 09:33.323
Your family's foundation does great work.

09:33.407 --> 09:34.741
And I'm Molly.

09:34.825 --> 09:37.202
And your family's vodka
also does great work.

09:37.286 --> 09:39.121
For me. On the dance floor.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.002
<i>Parlez français?</i>

09:46.795 --> 09:49.715
I mean, I know how to cheers
in several languages.

09:49.798 --> 09:51.341
Just a heads-up.

09:51.425 --> 09:55.179
Try not to say <i>ochinchin</i>
to a room full of Japanese businessmen.

09:55.262 --> 09:57.639
It means,
"Cheers to your little boy's penis."

09:58.640 --> 09:59.683
Good to know.

10:01.810 --> 10:04.646
Well, if you will excuse me.
Please enjoy your evening.

10:05.272 --> 10:06.315
And you.

10:08.108 --> 10:11.195
I can't believe that's
that hot baby all grown up.

10:13.947 --> 10:17.951
I mean, the GUI that you added
to keep track of moving averages…

10:18.702 --> 10:19.786
Genius alert!

10:20.329 --> 10:23.582
- You really love this stuff, don't you?
- I do, yes. Very much so.

10:23.665 --> 10:26.376
Let me give you my card.
You should come by our offices.

10:27.252 --> 10:29.546
Yeah! I would-- I-- Definitely.
Let's do it.

10:29.630 --> 10:31.131
I'll just finish my Martinelli's here.

10:31.924 --> 10:34.801
He means another time
when we're not at a party.

10:35.344 --> 10:38.138
Got it. Sorry. Got a little excited.

10:38.222 --> 10:39.306
You're doing great.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.230
So sorry.

10:48.524 --> 10:49.691
Hailey?

10:49.775 --> 10:51.109
Molly. Hi.

10:51.944 --> 10:52.986
Hi.

10:54.112 --> 10:56.865
- Hey. Sorry.
- No, I-- Sorry.

10:56.949 --> 10:58.825
I didn't want to run into you like this.

10:58.909 --> 11:00.994
It's fine. I'm fine. Everything's fine.

11:01.870 --> 11:03.413
- Cool.
- Cool.

11:06.124 --> 11:06.959
I like your dress.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.211
Really?

11:09.294 --> 11:11.380
So, do you wanna fuck it
the way you fucked my husband?

11:11.463 --> 11:13.340
Okay. It seems like you're not fine.

11:13.423 --> 11:17.094
Molly! Hey. Long time no see.

11:17.678 --> 11:19.763
What are you doing here?
I thought you were in Monaco.

11:19.847 --> 11:23.100
Well, we were, but then,
you know, the Mannies called.

11:23.183 --> 11:25.018
I'm a big donor, so they wanted me here.

11:25.102 --> 11:26.603
So we turned the plane around.

11:26.687 --> 11:28.313
- Fantastic.
- Yeah.

11:29.773 --> 11:33.610
So, can she eat her steak by herself,
or do you need to cut it for her?

11:33.694 --> 11:35.404
Neither. I'm a pescatarian.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.281
Okay, let's just take a breath here.

11:37.364 --> 11:41.034
I am breathing just fine, thank you.
Everything is fine.

11:41.118 --> 11:43.412
There is nothing abnormal
about the way I'm breathing.

11:43.495 --> 11:44.830
I am perfectly breathing normally.

11:44.913 --> 11:46.957
It's not out of the ordinary.
Thank you very much.

11:47.040 --> 11:50.169
Why don't you two have a great night?
I'll see you guys later. Goodbye.

11:55.841 --> 11:56.967
- John is here.
- What?

11:57.050 --> 11:58.802
John is here with Hailey.

11:58.886 --> 12:00.470
Oh, my God. Are you okay?

12:00.554 --> 12:03.348
I'm gonna kill him. I'm gonna kill him.
If I see him, I'm gonna--

12:03.432 --> 12:05.726
Oh, my God. His hair looks amazing.

12:06.310 --> 12:09.229
Did he get a body wave?
There's no way that's natural.

12:10.564 --> 12:11.565
I can't do this.

12:15.652 --> 12:16.820
Come on.

12:17.529 --> 12:19.198
Molly! Molly, wait!

12:19.781 --> 12:22.910
Molly! Come on! Wait!
Hold up. Hold up. Hold up. Talk to us.

12:22.993 --> 12:25.412
I don't understand.
He never cared about charity before.

12:25.495 --> 12:28.332
- Why would he come here tonight?
- Because he wanted this to happen.

12:28.415 --> 12:30.334
- He wanted to get in your head.
- What?

12:30.417 --> 12:32.920
Nicholas is right. He's jealous of
the good press you're getting.

12:33.003 --> 12:34.922
He showed up to throw you off your game.

12:37.216 --> 12:38.967
I think he wants to win the breakup.

12:39.051 --> 12:41.595
Exactly. Okay?
So this is what you need to do.

12:41.678 --> 12:44.681
You need to calm down,
walk back in there, waltz up to John,

12:44.765 --> 12:48.644
and take a picture with him
with the biggest smile anyone's ever seen.

12:48.727 --> 12:49.728
Regain control.

12:49.811 --> 12:52.606
That is some real
<i>First Wives Club</i>-level stuff.

12:52.689 --> 12:55.651
- Exactly. And you're Bette Midler.
- No, I wanna be Goldie Hawn.

12:55.734 --> 12:57.986
We've talked about this.
I am clearly Goldie Hawn.

12:58.070 --> 12:59.738
I don't care about
what white woman you wanna be.

12:59.821 --> 13:01.573
If we're gonna do this,
we should get back in there.

13:03.742 --> 13:05.619
Clearly, someone's a Diane Keaton.

13:06.119 --> 13:07.829
- Who is that?
- I'll tell you later.

13:19.591 --> 13:21.343
- Hello, John.
- Hi.

13:21.426 --> 13:22.553
Hailey.

13:23.303 --> 13:25.514
I just wanted to stop by and say hi.

13:25.597 --> 13:28.141
- I love your dress.
- Thanks.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.769
- And your hair. It's beautiful.
- Isn't she gorgeous?

13:30.853 --> 13:33.146
What do you say
the three of us get a picture together?

13:33.939 --> 13:36.191
- Yeah. Okay.
- Okay, here we go.

13:39.236 --> 13:40.237
This is so nice.

13:40.320 --> 13:41.572
What a beautiful night, huh?

13:41.655 --> 13:43.782
- I love this night.
- Me too.

13:44.449 --> 13:47.578
All right. I better get back to my table
and work on my speech.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.621
- All right. Great to see you.
- Beautiful night.

13:49.705 --> 13:51.707
- Lovely to see you.
- Okay. Yeah.

13:59.423 --> 14:03.093
Then my Aunt Mabel says,
"The ice cream bar's in your hand."

14:05.137 --> 14:08.348
Such a humorous ending.
Howard, what do you do?

14:08.432 --> 14:10.726
Well, I'm currently
in information technology,

14:10.809 --> 14:13.061
but to save time,
I call it "information T."

14:13.145 --> 14:14.605
Uh-huh. I knew it. IT.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.191
So, is your company a new start-up idea?

14:17.274 --> 14:20.611
Oh, no. I mean, I'm just an employee
at the Wells Foundation.

14:20.694 --> 14:22.946
Yeah, Howard is a huge part of our team.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.823
We couldn't get through
a single day without him.

14:24.907 --> 14:27.201
Such admirable work.

14:27.284 --> 14:29.203
I mean, yeah, it's admirable,

14:29.286 --> 14:32.206
but it doesn't mean
I don't have other irons in the fire.

14:32.289 --> 14:35.667
I mean, I've almost started
a pro-wrestling podcast several times.

14:35.751 --> 14:38.170
- Wow.
- In many ways, I'm jealous of you.

14:38.253 --> 14:39.963
You have your whole life ahead of you.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.216
You can explore your passions.

14:42.799 --> 14:44.259
I mean, I love my company,

14:44.343 --> 14:46.637
but sometimes I call it
my six-billion-dollar prison.

14:55.312 --> 14:58.649
My God. This--
This is what you wanted to deprive us of?

14:58.732 --> 15:00.943
Okay, you're right.
This lobster is stupid good.

15:01.026 --> 15:02.653
I'm not even chewing. It's just melting.

15:05.948 --> 15:08.033
There's chocolate inside of everything.

15:13.038 --> 15:15.249
I'm gonna go freshen up for my speech.

15:36.645 --> 15:38.438
What do you think about a peace offering?

15:40.983 --> 15:42.192
What do you want?

15:46.572 --> 15:47.698
Okay, look.

15:50.868 --> 15:51.952
Please.

15:57.833 --> 15:58.834
What I want…

16:01.128 --> 16:03.005
is to say that I'm sorry.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.967
Wow.

16:07.593 --> 16:10.012
Here it comes.
The moment we've all been waiting for.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.221
Look, I mean it.

16:12.264 --> 16:14.808
I mean, there were problems.
We both know that. But…

16:16.476 --> 16:19.354
I should have addressed them with you
instead of running away. It--

16:21.148 --> 16:23.525
I disrespected you and our marriage.

16:23.609 --> 16:27.529
And… I regret it.

16:32.284 --> 16:33.285
Okay.

16:35.913 --> 16:37.456
Thank you for saying that.

16:37.539 --> 16:39.541
Wha-- Hold on, Molly. I'm not done.

16:41.752 --> 16:44.213
I also wanted to say that…

16:46.006 --> 16:48.842
what you're doing now, with the charity,

16:50.219 --> 16:51.386
it's amazing.

16:52.262 --> 16:55.766
I mean, to endure what I put you through
and end up where you did?

16:58.352 --> 16:59.853
It's extremely impressive.

17:01.772 --> 17:03.190
I probably shouldn't say this,

17:03.273 --> 17:07.109
but I think Hailey
is a little jealous of you.

17:10.571 --> 17:12.907
Well, you definitely shouldn't say that.

17:15.243 --> 17:18.789
And I definitely shouldn't say
that I love hearing that.

17:25.253 --> 17:26.713
So…

17:29.132 --> 17:30.717
how do you like being the boss?

17:31.760 --> 17:33.512
- I like it.
- Yeah.

17:33.595 --> 17:35.430
I mean, sometimes.
Sometimes it's terrible.

17:35.514 --> 17:36.807
I heard that.

17:38.308 --> 17:40.185
You're, you know,
definitely making a difference,

17:40.269 --> 17:42.396
so that's something
to be proud of right there.

17:44.815 --> 17:48.026
I mean, obviously, it's way easier
to give money away than to earn it,

17:48.110 --> 17:49.111
but still.

17:52.281 --> 17:53.532
That's just a joke.

17:54.116 --> 17:56.159
You can't help yourself, can you?

17:56.827 --> 17:58.579
Okay. Take it easy.

17:58.662 --> 18:00.455
Don't tell me to "take it easy."

18:01.164 --> 18:06.545
You have this pathological need
for competition. I--

18:07.337 --> 18:09.798
That's what this whole night is
for you, isn't it?

18:09.882 --> 18:12.467
What competition are you talking about?

18:12.551 --> 18:16.889
I mean, you understand there is a big
difference between building what I built

18:16.972 --> 18:19.600
and then just giving away half
of what I earned

18:19.683 --> 18:21.101
to some fucking dance teams.

18:21.185 --> 18:22.728
- What you earned?
- Yeah.

18:22.811 --> 18:25.063
I was there every step of the way.

18:25.147 --> 18:29.109
I supported you
while you dicked around in our garage,

18:29.193 --> 18:32.154
doubting yourself,
wondering if you were ever gonna make it.

18:32.237 --> 18:33.447
But I did make it.

18:33.530 --> 18:38.744
And then you sat by the pool
for 20 years doing literally nothing.

18:38.827 --> 18:41.496
So I feel like that's a pretty good return
on your investment.

18:41.580 --> 18:43.332
This was a mistake.

18:43.415 --> 18:45.584
I'm going to get my award.

18:45.667 --> 18:48.212
Okay. Well, you're welcome, by the way.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.631
For what? What does that mean?

18:50.714 --> 18:52.007
Come on, Molly.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.051
How do you think they choose
who gets these awards?

18:54.134 --> 18:57.804
You think there's a computer that measures
how much good you're doing in the world?

18:57.888 --> 18:59.640
I have no idea how it works.

18:59.723 --> 19:02.100
I'm friends with some people
on the board of this event.

19:02.184 --> 19:05.938
I made some calls,
strongly suggested they give you an award.

19:08.482 --> 19:10.234
I don't know,
I thought you could use the win.

19:24.581 --> 19:27.000
Hey. Everybody was wondering
where you went.

19:29.169 --> 19:30.087
Something wrong?

19:30.170 --> 19:33.006
Never give you enough cornichons
with your charcuterie.

19:33.090 --> 19:36.885
Okay. Something not food-related
bothering you?

19:37.553 --> 19:40.264
It's just that your man, Martin,
said something that made me think.

19:41.014 --> 19:43.976
I mean, I know you look at me
as your young, hip, Gen Z friend

19:44.059 --> 19:46.228
that's, like, 23, 24 tops.

19:47.187 --> 19:48.814
Yeah. Yeah. Something like that.

19:48.897 --> 19:52.109
Well, I'm not 23. I'm 38 years old.

19:52.192 --> 19:54.194
So I don't have my whole life
in front of me,

19:54.278 --> 19:56.989
and I'm just not happy
with where I am right now.

19:57.072 --> 19:58.782
Sometimes I'm just up late at night

19:58.866 --> 20:00.909
wondering if I'm wasting my life
or something.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.245
I'm sorry, buddy.

20:03.745 --> 20:07.040
Yeah. You know, it's kind of just
all hitting me at once,

20:07.124 --> 20:11.378
and I was quietly processing it
until someone rudely interrupted me.

20:12.379 --> 20:16.383
Got it. Well, I'm sorry I interrupted you.

20:16.466 --> 20:19.303
But I gotta say, Howard,

20:19.386 --> 20:23.056
you have a gift
that almost no one else in the world has.

20:23.140 --> 20:26.518
People love you.
They want to be around you.

20:26.602 --> 20:29.271
Take tonight. You had those billionaires
eating out of your hand.

20:29.354 --> 20:30.480
That's easy.

20:30.564 --> 20:33.317
That's just eye contact
and picturing everyone as Santa Claus.

20:33.400 --> 20:37.571
My point is, someone with your charisma
is gonna go far in this world.

20:37.654 --> 20:41.450
I guarantee you that one day
you will be someone's Martin Streibler.

20:43.327 --> 20:45.704
Thank you. That's cool of you to say.

20:45.787 --> 20:47.289
You wanna head back to the table?

20:47.372 --> 20:48.832
- Yeah.
- Okay.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.459
But grab that charcuterie for me.

20:51.210 --> 20:52.586
Okay.

20:52.669 --> 20:55.047
I think there are people
that do this, but okay.

21:02.763 --> 21:05.224
Hey, you coming in?

21:05.307 --> 21:06.767
I think your award's up soon.

21:07.518 --> 21:11.688
I'm sorry. I just don't feel like
accepting an award right now.

21:14.274 --> 21:17.903
You sure? 'Cause your speech is great,
and you look beautiful.

21:18.737 --> 21:19.988
Thank you.

21:21.031 --> 21:24.243
I think everything started feeling
too intense, you know?

21:24.785 --> 21:26.745
You guys should stay and enjoy your night.

21:26.828 --> 21:30.457
I'll just sit here for a sec,
and then I'm gonna head home.

21:32.084 --> 21:33.085
Okay.

21:33.710 --> 21:34.962
Yeah, she's not coming back.

21:35.045 --> 21:37.172
Okay. Then where we going?

21:39.758 --> 21:42.261
You guys, you left your table?

21:42.344 --> 21:44.137
Are you sure you don't wanna stay?

21:44.221 --> 21:47.599
No. What's the point of being in there
if you're not with us?

21:47.683 --> 21:49.434
Yeah, we got your back, coz.

21:49.518 --> 21:51.937
If we're leaving,
why don't we just go to Dave & Buster's?

21:52.020 --> 21:54.898
- I got a ton of tickets.
- No, Howard, those tickets are a scam.

21:54.982 --> 21:58.151
No, they are not.
I'm only 700,000 away from a PS3.

21:58.235 --> 21:59.069
What?

21:59.152 --> 22:01.905
The amount you're spending there
you could be putting into a Roth IRA.

22:01.989 --> 22:05.075
It doesn't matter. I'm not getting
hate-crimed at a Dave & Buster's tonight.

22:22.342 --> 22:25.804
Rest in peace, you titans of charity.

22:26.930 --> 22:28.265
And now, on a lighter note,

22:28.348 --> 22:31.560
here to accept
the Marjorie Pendleton Foster Award,

22:31.643 --> 22:34.646
please give a warm welcome
to Ms. Molly Wells.

22:44.031 --> 22:45.949
Has anyone seen Molly Wells?

22:48.076 --> 22:49.411
She was right there.

22:50.204 --> 22:51.955
Sorry, everyone. So sorry.

22:52.039 --> 22:54.291
Molly Wells, ladies and gentlemen.

22:54.374 --> 22:55.375
Thank you.

22:56.627 --> 22:59.338
Sorry. Sorry, everyone.

22:59.421 --> 23:02.883
I bet some of you thought
I got hit by a train like Marjorie.

23:04.510 --> 23:05.886
Not going down like her.

23:07.596 --> 23:12.809
Tonight, I had planned to give
a long speech that was all about me.

23:14.061 --> 23:19.107
But I don't know
how much I deserve this award.

23:20.484 --> 23:23.070
I mean, don't get me wrong,
I am pretty great.

23:24.863 --> 23:28.951
But I'm also pretty new
to this charity thing.

23:30.702 --> 23:34.873
And you know who's been
putting in the work for a long time?

23:36.166 --> 23:37.167
My team.

23:38.544 --> 23:42.923
They work hard
without ever asking for credit.

23:44.091 --> 23:49.179
And they're always there for me
in every way.

23:50.973 --> 23:55.269
So I'd like to ask them to come up here
and accept this award,

23:55.352 --> 23:57.813
because tonight should really be
about them.

24:07.739 --> 24:10.492
Oh, my God. This is amazing.

24:10.576 --> 24:12.494
I didn't even want
to come to this tonight,

24:12.578 --> 24:14.121
but I loved those martinis

24:14.204 --> 24:16.582
and the little potato chips
with the tuna on them.

24:16.665 --> 24:18.083
And now this!

24:18.166 --> 24:20.085
Oh, my God, this is heavy. Thank you!

24:34.725 --> 24:37.853
Hey, the night is still young.
How long does Dave & Buster's stay open?

24:37.936 --> 24:40.689
- The one in the mall closes at 11:00.
- We can make it.

24:40.772 --> 24:42.858
- Yeah.
- Okay, apps are on me, guys.

24:43.817 --> 24:44.985
Miss Wells!

24:47.613 --> 24:48.614
Hi again.

24:48.697 --> 24:49.698
Hi again.

24:49.781 --> 24:51.116
I like what you said up there.

24:52.034 --> 24:52.910
Thanks.

24:54.328 --> 24:57.831
If you're open to it,
I'd love to work on a project together.

24:59.666 --> 25:01.877
Yeah. That would be great.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.754
All right. Give me a call.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.381
I'll be waiting.

25:06.965 --> 25:07.966
Okay.

25:10.761 --> 25:12.763
Oh, my God.

25:12.846 --> 25:14.431
Don't worry about it, you guys.

25:16.225 --> 25:18.477
Okay, when I say Dave, you say Buster's.

25:18.560 --> 25:19.645
- Dave.
- Buster's!

25:19.728 --> 25:20.604
- Dave.
- Buster's!

25:20.687 --> 25:21.605
- Dave.
- Buster's!

25:21.688 --> 25:22.648
- Dave.
- Buster's!

25:22.731 --> 25:23.565
- Dave.
- Buster's!

25:23.649 --> 25:24.483
- Dave.
- Buster's!

25:24.566 --> 25:25.859
- Dave.
- Buster's!
