And when the not-so-cute
boy pony asked out

00:04.819 --> 00:07.069
the girl pony, she said...

00:07.105 --> 00:08.771
- "Neigh"!
- Yeah!

00:08.773 --> 00:10.072
- Watch out, watch out...
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

00:10.124 --> 00:11.974
- Lift it a little bit, come on.
- Ouch! My hand!

00:11.976 --> 00:14.043
- All right, what are you doing?
- Can you believe it?

00:14.078 --> 00:15.895
Somebody just left this
chair on the street.

00:15.930 --> 00:17.980
Yeah. Maybe they died before they could
get it all the way to the dumpster.

00:20.068 --> 00:22.902
Ben, you don't need
to bring in everything

00:22.937 --> 00:24.070
you find outside.

00:24.105 --> 00:25.855
Oh, no offense.

Hey, guys, turn up the volume a little.

00:44.689 --> 00:45.772
Oh, and I'm gonna need another beer,

00:45.774 --> 00:49.609
so volume and beer. And pretzels!

00:49.661 --> 00:51.611

00:53.748 --> 00:55.615
All right, just for
that, I'm not gonna let

00:55.667 --> 00:57.617
either of you have your
turn in Chairy Lee Lewis.

00:58.753 --> 00:59.786
Ben? Hi.

00:59.838 --> 01:02.538
I'm kind of afraid to
ask what you're doin'.

01:02.590 --> 01:04.674
It's my new chair. Pretty cool, right?

01:04.709 --> 01:06.626
Whether kickin' back, watchin' sports,

01:06.678 --> 01:08.711
or just putting your hand in
the waistband of your shorts,

01:08.763 --> 01:10.546
it's a sign that you're finally a man.

01:11.716 --> 01:12.799
You know what I like most about you?

01:12.851 --> 01:15.601
Your ability to not care when
people are laughing at you.

01:16.805 --> 01:18.771
But I'm actually glad to see you.

01:18.807 --> 01:20.640
I finally found a new job,

01:20.692 --> 01:22.692
so this is my official two-week notice.

01:22.727 --> 01:24.610
I think it'd be better for both of us

01:24.646 --> 01:26.562
if we just didn't work together.

01:26.614 --> 01:27.647
You agree, right?

01:27.649 --> 01:28.698
No.

01:29.784 --> 01:31.651
Maybe? I guess.

01:31.653 --> 01:32.785
Look, I'm really sorry about everything

01:32.821 --> 01:35.705
that's happened or
didn't happen between us.

01:35.740 --> 01:36.823
Me too.

01:36.825 --> 01:39.792
I'm gonna go grab Riley for yoga.

01:39.828 --> 01:41.627
See you around, Ben.

01:41.663 --> 01:43.830
I'll be right here just being a man.

01:43.832 --> 01:44.797
(creak)

01:50.755 --> 01:51.704
(knocking)

01:51.739 --> 01:52.839
Knock, knock.

01:52.874 --> 01:54.690
Hey, Tuck, can you help me
get rid of this stupid chair?

01:54.726 --> 01:57.510
Oh, no, no. Been there,
done that, not touching it.

01:57.545 --> 01:58.511
No, no, no.

01:58.513 --> 01:59.879
Why don't you ask Danny for help?

01:59.914 --> 02:02.331
Oh, right, you can't, you're in a fight.

02:02.383 --> 02:03.816
You think you're right,
he thinks he's right.

02:03.852 --> 02:07.386
I'm the only one that's right
'cause I think you both crazy.

02:07.388 --> 02:08.738
Are you done?

02:08.773 --> 02:10.705
What's with the suit? Did somebody die?

02:11.759 --> 02:12.775
Oh, my god, did somebody die?

02:12.811 --> 02:14.660
I'm so sorry.

02:14.712 --> 02:17.663
No, the station is
sending me out to cover

02:17.699 --> 02:18.698
a big entertainment story.

02:18.750 --> 02:20.666
Oh! Tucker, that's great!

02:20.668 --> 02:22.485
A beauty pageant for toddlers.

02:22.520 --> 02:23.536
Oh...

02:23.538 --> 02:24.587
Tucker, that's horrible.

02:24.639 --> 02:25.638
Can I...

02:25.640 --> 02:28.407
You know what? Those pageants,

02:28.409 --> 02:29.559
they aren't even for the kids.

02:29.594 --> 02:31.511
They're really for the moms
who are trying to make up

02:31.563 --> 02:33.462
for the lack of fulfillment
in their own lives.

02:33.498 --> 02:35.815
They are certainly no place
for a pudgy four-year-old

02:35.850 --> 02:37.383
with a lazy eye and a heart of gold.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.418
Oh, no, no, she doesn't
even get to compete!

02:42.790 --> 02:44.757
Oh, my god.

02:44.809 --> 02:47.743
Wait, Riley, I think your
sad, pathetic, tragic childhood

02:47.779 --> 02:48.761
may have just come in handy.

02:49.931 --> 02:52.715
Yeah, I just need to expose
the... the dark underbelly

02:52.750 --> 02:54.734
of the toddler beauty pageant circuit.

02:54.769 --> 02:56.652
A Tucker Dobbs exclusive...

02:56.704 --> 02:58.604
(whispers) exclusive, exclusive...

03:00.408 --> 03:01.541
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:01.543 --> 03:03.476
I just need to find a mom
who's willing to act like

03:03.528 --> 03:05.428
a complete jackass in front of a camera.

03:05.463 --> 03:06.462
Hey, guys!

03:06.497 --> 03:07.813
(panting)

03:07.849 --> 03:09.782
Oh, man...

03:09.784 --> 03:11.801
it is hard outrunning a police horse.

03:13.738 --> 03:15.788
Unrelated, if a guy named Brick calls,

03:15.840 --> 03:17.690
tell him the drop has been made.

03:23.498 --> 03:25.464
Okay, what's with the hand signals

03:25.500 --> 03:26.649
and the darty eyes?

03:26.684 --> 03:27.650
Nothing.

03:27.702 --> 03:30.503
Tucker just has to cover
this baby beauty pageant

03:30.505 --> 03:31.604
and he thought it'd be fun to profile

03:31.639 --> 03:33.489
one of the moms or grandmoms.

03:33.541 --> 03:35.374
That's so lame, right?

03:35.376 --> 03:38.477
(scoffs) Uh, no, not lame.

03:38.479 --> 03:40.746
Everybody loves a good pageant story.

03:40.798 --> 03:42.832
You know, I was two-time runner up

03:42.867 --> 03:44.483
Miss Teen Northeastern New Jersey

03:44.519 --> 03:46.819
till a very large baby
bump derailed my career.

03:49.741 --> 03:52.625
Hey, I have a brilliant idea.

03:52.660 --> 03:53.776
What if I entered Emma?

03:54.829 --> 03:57.697
Wow. Uh, yeah.

03:57.732 --> 03:59.699
That is brilliant, but I don't know.

03:59.701 --> 04:01.467
I mean, what will Ben say?

04:01.519 --> 04:04.420
Nothing, because he
doesn't need to know.

04:04.455 --> 04:06.455
Just like he didn't
know that I accidentally

04:06.491 --> 04:08.324
vacuumed up his pet iguana Charles.

04:10.395 --> 04:11.444
We lost a great vacuum that day.

04:14.816 --> 04:17.333
Oh, good morning,
Chaireem Abdul Chairbar.

04:18.853 --> 04:20.353
What's this?

04:20.387 --> 04:22.321
"Dear Ben, can't shake the feeling that

04:22.373 --> 04:23.673
"there's still something between us.

04:23.725 --> 04:25.625
"If you know who this is
and you feel the same way,

04:25.660 --> 04:26.826
"meet me at Cafe
Georgia tonight at 7:00.

04:26.861 --> 04:29.612
If I don't see you, I'll
know we weren't meant to be."

04:30.665 --> 04:32.498
Oh, my god,

04:32.533 --> 04:34.600
that's the most romantic
thing I've ever heard!

04:36.404 --> 04:37.420
Who's it from?

04:37.455 --> 04:38.537
She didn't sign it.

04:38.573 --> 04:39.472
You think it might be Sam?

04:39.524 --> 04:41.357
Oh! It has to be Sam!

04:41.392 --> 04:43.793
You mean the Sam who
literally says every day,

04:43.828 --> 04:46.412
"Ben, stay away from me.
"Ben, stop talking to me.

04:46.414 --> 04:47.713
Ben, stop staring at my boobs"?

04:48.850 --> 04:50.366
Yeah, that Sam.

04:50.418 --> 04:51.851
I mean, if it's not her, then who is it?

04:51.886 --> 04:53.819
I mean, there have got to
be dozens of women out there

04:53.821 --> 04:56.589
who wouldn't mind another
spin on the Wheeler.

04:59.627 --> 05:00.593
What if you go

05:00.645 --> 05:02.478
and it's not someone you like,

05:02.530 --> 05:04.463
then that poor girl is
completely embarrassed

05:04.499 --> 05:05.431
and humiliated?

05:05.483 --> 05:07.350
Oh, my god, could you think like a dude

05:07.385 --> 05:09.435
and not a teenage girl just once?

05:09.487 --> 05:11.370
I'll get there early, check her out,

05:11.406 --> 05:12.788
if I don't like what I see,
I'll hide out in the men's room

05:12.840 --> 05:14.307
until she leaves, heartbroken.

05:14.359 --> 05:15.741
I'm not a complete jerk.

05:15.777 --> 05:19.312
You know what, this is
actually a really great idea.

05:19.364 --> 05:20.780
Yeah, I'll bet Riley
misses me just as much

05:20.782 --> 05:22.748
as I miss her, she just
doesn't know how to tell me.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.767
I'm gonna write her a
note telling her to meet me

05:24.819 --> 05:27.586
down at the bar tonight to
see if she feels the same way.

05:27.638 --> 05:28.771
Cool.

05:28.806 --> 05:30.656
Hey, what if the girl who
wrote me this note was Riley?

05:30.708 --> 05:31.657
Wouldn't that be hilarious?

05:33.561 --> 05:34.527
No?

05:39.567 --> 05:41.367
(door opens)

05:42.537 --> 05:44.387
- Tucker: All right, look...
- (Door closes)

05:44.439 --> 05:46.822
you will never, ever hear
me say this to you again.

05:46.874 --> 05:49.392
When we get there, be yourself.

05:50.812 --> 05:51.794
Oh, hey.

05:51.829 --> 05:53.396
Off to the pageant?

05:53.431 --> 05:55.765
Oh, good luck, Emma.

05:55.817 --> 05:56.782
She doesn't need luck.

05:56.834 --> 05:59.568
She has me, someone who understands

05:59.604 --> 06:01.604
how important it is to look her best...

06:01.639 --> 06:04.724
clearly something you
give zero patoots about.

06:04.726 --> 06:06.659
(chuckles) For example,

06:06.661 --> 06:09.478
you have toilet paper stuck
to the bottom of your shoe.

06:09.530 --> 06:11.514
That's not toilet paper.

06:11.549 --> 06:12.515
- It's garbage.
- (Ding)

06:14.369 --> 06:15.401
Pretty girl.

06:16.587 --> 06:18.471
- I'm actually going down too.
- Well, just take another.

06:18.473 --> 06:19.755
- Bonnie: Take the next one.
- Oh, my gosh.

06:21.826 --> 06:23.426
Oh, good, you survived.

06:23.478 --> 06:24.727
So?

06:24.762 --> 06:25.745
How'd it go?

06:25.797 --> 06:27.380
Get any crazy footage?

06:27.415 --> 06:29.648
Um, unfortunately, no. No.

06:29.684 --> 06:31.801
The cameras weren't even rolling
before someone got thrown out

06:31.836 --> 06:33.786
for trying to bribe the judges.

06:33.821 --> 06:35.588
Oh, my god.

06:35.623 --> 06:38.657
What kind of pathetic lowlife
tries to cheat little kids?

06:38.709 --> 06:40.543
Oh, don't you judge me, Perrin.

06:41.629 --> 06:42.611
(scoffs) I mean,

06:42.663 --> 06:45.548
it's not like I tried to blackmail them.

06:45.583 --> 06:47.366
Oh, man!

06:47.402 --> 06:48.451
That's what I should've done!

06:48.486 --> 06:50.352
God!

06:50.388 --> 06:53.355
They have not seen the
last of Bonnie Wheeler.

06:53.408 --> 06:54.824
(door closes)

06:54.876 --> 06:56.792
I wish I'd seen the
last of Bonnie Wheeler.

07:03.618 --> 07:05.518
(high-pitched) Riley...

07:05.553 --> 07:07.620
have I ever told you
how much I love you?

07:08.673 --> 07:10.689
- Only when you need something.
- (Chuckle)

07:10.691 --> 07:12.458
- I love you.
- Oh...

07:13.628 --> 07:16.429
Please? Come on, come on,
come on, I need more footage.

07:16.464 --> 07:19.381
I need you to go undercover
as Emma's mom to help me

07:19.434 --> 07:21.367
catch one of the real
moms behaving horribly.

07:21.402 --> 07:22.501
Tucker, no!

07:22.537 --> 07:25.438
Okay? These pageants go
against everything I believe in.

07:25.473 --> 07:28.407
Which is why you should do this!

07:28.459 --> 07:31.360
Do it for every woman out
there who doesn't have a voice.

07:32.747 --> 07:34.763
Do it for every pudgy, cross-eyed girl

07:34.816 --> 07:36.749
with a bad perm and corrective shoes

07:36.784 --> 07:37.733
who didn't have a chance.

07:39.787 --> 07:41.587
I never said anything

07:41.639 --> 07:44.523
about a bad perm or corrective shoes.

07:44.575 --> 07:45.624
Was I wrong?

07:48.396 --> 07:49.361
No.

07:50.498 --> 07:52.381
You know what? Fine. All right.

07:52.416 --> 07:54.767
Gives me a good reason to avoid Danny.

07:58.873 --> 08:00.706
Oh, I'm sorry,

08:00.741 --> 08:02.708
I'm saving this chair
for the love of my life.

08:02.743 --> 08:04.293
We're sort of on a break.

08:04.328 --> 08:05.661
Actually, she would
say we were broken up,

08:05.696 --> 08:07.763
but I think she needs to
stop focusing on the past

08:07.798 --> 08:10.566
and realize what's truly
important is our future.

08:12.670 --> 08:13.702
Oh, I'm sorry,

08:13.754 --> 08:16.522
I'm saving this chair
for the love of my life.

08:16.557 --> 08:18.474
Yeah, we're sort of on a break.

08:18.509 --> 08:19.592
Actually, she would
say we were broken up,

08:19.644 --> 08:21.560
but I think she just needs
to stop focusing on the past

08:21.612 --> 08:23.579
and realize what's
truly... Okay, cool.

08:25.000 --> 08:31.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

08:33.341 --> 08:34.390
Ben!

08:34.424 --> 08:35.407
Julia?

08:35.443 --> 08:36.408
Julia!

08:36.443 --> 08:37.743
Julia!

08:37.794 --> 08:38.811
It's you!

08:38.846 --> 08:40.696
Wow, I didn't...

08:40.731 --> 08:41.780
You're here early!

08:41.782 --> 08:43.716
I love this place.

08:43.717 --> 08:46.619
If you remember, this is
where we had our first date.

08:46.671 --> 08:48.470
Oh, I remember.

08:48.523 --> 08:49.705
I also remember it was our only date.

08:49.740 --> 08:52.558
Yeah, about that...

08:52.593 --> 08:54.460
I'm really sorry.

08:54.495 --> 08:55.528
I think I just overreacted.

08:55.580 --> 08:56.562
Honestly.

08:56.597 --> 08:58.380
I've regretted it ever since.

08:58.416 --> 09:00.332
Well, if you're in the
mood to regret things,

09:00.368 --> 09:01.367
why don't we go back to my place?

09:01.402 --> 09:02.418
(chuckles awkwardly)

09:02.470 --> 09:04.303
I bet you regret that line.

09:04.338 --> 09:05.721
I do.

09:05.756 --> 09:06.722
It's okay.

09:06.757 --> 09:08.357
- It actually worked.
- Oh.

09:17.718 --> 09:19.702
Hey, have you seen this guy?

09:21.556 --> 09:23.656
Oh, yeah. He just left
with some girl he picked up.

09:23.658 --> 09:26.475
Of course he did.

09:26.527 --> 09:27.526
Did he hit on you too?

09:27.562 --> 09:28.494
A little.

09:36.614 --> 09:38.163
You know, I have to tell ya,

09:38.215 --> 09:39.598
it was pretty brave,
you writing that note.

09:39.633 --> 09:41.483
I don't think I would've
had the guts to do it.

09:41.519 --> 09:42.551
Thanks.

09:44.522 --> 09:46.422
Wait, what are you talking about?

09:46.457 --> 09:48.340
The note that you wrote.

09:48.376 --> 09:50.292
I didn't write a note.

09:50.344 --> 09:51.393
What?

09:51.429 --> 09:53.228
Then what are we doing on my couch?

09:53.280 --> 09:56.348
I thought making a pit stop
on the way to the bedroom.

09:59.236 --> 10:01.253
Well, if you didn't
write this, then who did?

10:01.305 --> 10:04.206
Maybe the girl you
were supposed to meet.

10:05.643 --> 10:07.593
You know what? Whoever she is,

10:07.645 --> 10:09.161
she's too good for you.

10:09.196 --> 10:10.629
Well, I'd agree with you
if I knew who she was!

10:12.183 --> 10:12.598
(door closes)

10:14.235 --> 10:15.551
Maybe all hope isn't lost.

10:15.586 --> 10:17.636
You left before Note Girl got there,

10:17.638 --> 10:19.405
so just tell her something came up.

10:19.407 --> 10:21.440
Did you forget the part
where I don't know who she is?

10:25.379 --> 10:26.478
Uh, exactly!

10:26.514 --> 10:27.513
Exactly, man!

10:27.515 --> 10:29.448
Uh, which is why...

10:29.500 --> 10:33.252
which is why you...

10:33.287 --> 10:35.254
you... you're gonna
write her a note,

10:35.289 --> 10:37.222
and yup, yup, you are
gonna write her a note

10:37.258 --> 10:39.191
and you are gonna beg
her for a second chance.

10:39.226 --> 10:41.360
All right? Just tell her
you will meet you at the bar

10:41.395 --> 10:43.295
and, uh, just put the note in the chair.

10:43.297 --> 10:45.230
- What do you think I should say?
- Uh...

10:45.282 --> 10:47.583
you know, maybe something like, uh...

10:47.618 --> 10:49.585
"Truly sorry I missed you last night.

10:49.620 --> 10:51.570
Please give me a second chance",

10:51.572 --> 10:53.455
you know, something...
something like that,

10:53.507 --> 10:54.606
but, uh, maybe a little bit longer.

10:54.642 --> 10:55.641
Yeah.

10:55.693 --> 10:58.377
Oh, almost forgot to tell
you, Riley came by earlier

10:58.379 --> 11:00.295
to pick up Emma to
take her to preschool,

11:00.331 --> 11:03.398
so no need to follow
up on that story, okay?

11:06.303 --> 11:07.352
- Let's get it.
- Wait a minute,

11:07.354 --> 11:08.370
what the hell is this?

11:10.391 --> 11:13.242
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Morty, what are you doing?

11:13.277 --> 11:14.293
That's my brother's.

11:14.345 --> 11:16.161
I know it looks like an old chair,

11:16.197 --> 11:17.312
but it holds a lot of hopes and dreams.

11:19.166 --> 11:20.232
I had a futon like that once.

11:20.267 --> 11:21.233
I get it.

11:22.653 --> 11:24.219
Oh, hey, what's this?

11:26.190 --> 11:27.573
"Truly sorry I missed you last night.

11:27.625 --> 11:29.458
"Please give me a second chance.

11:29.510 --> 11:30.542
This whole thing is my fault."

11:30.594 --> 11:32.478
"This whole thing is my fault."

11:32.480 --> 11:34.379
Oh, my god, this is from Riley!

11:34.415 --> 11:36.398
Riley? Is that a guy or a girl?

11:36.433 --> 11:37.533
She's a girl.

11:37.568 --> 11:39.451
Girl? Wow.

11:39.453 --> 11:41.270
My gaydar's way off.

11:46.427 --> 11:48.227
(chatter)

11:49.363 --> 11:52.264
My little Emma's gotta keep
on winning that prize money.

11:52.299 --> 11:55.234
We spent her last prize on a treadmill.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.169
Not for me, for her.

11:57.221 --> 11:59.605
She just can't lose that baby fat.

11:59.640 --> 12:01.156
How 'bout you?

12:01.192 --> 12:03.458
Oh, we're not here to win money.

12:03.494 --> 12:04.510
My daughter begged me to do it.

12:04.512 --> 12:05.561
She loves to dance so much.

12:05.596 --> 12:07.446
I'm just here to support her.

12:07.448 --> 12:11.350
But don't you sort
of love the glory too?

12:11.402 --> 12:14.486
I mean, a win for Emma
is really a win for me,

12:14.522 --> 12:15.554
you know what I mean?

12:15.556 --> 12:19.258
Well, I sure hope you win then.

12:19.293 --> 12:20.375
Sounds like you really need it.

12:24.315 --> 12:25.380
This is a disaster.

12:25.432 --> 12:28.283
Everybody here is nice and supportive.

12:28.335 --> 12:30.319
Why do good people always
have to happen to me?

12:30.354 --> 12:32.638
Where the crazy ladies at?

12:32.640 --> 12:34.189
Ah!

12:35.342 --> 12:38.210
Nothing like the smell of hairspray,

12:38.245 --> 12:39.611
tanning lotion, and baby tears.

12:39.663 --> 12:41.463
I'm home!

12:41.515 --> 12:42.598
Lucy Carmichael,

12:42.633 --> 12:44.483
pageant coach to the stars.

12:44.535 --> 12:45.617
Lose that bow, kid.

12:45.619 --> 12:47.436
Red is so over.

12:47.471 --> 12:48.437
You!

12:48.472 --> 12:50.455
You two look like you could use my help.

12:50.491 --> 12:52.391
What are you... what
are you doing here?

12:52.426 --> 12:54.443
I'm here to help make sure
Emma upholds my legacy.

12:54.495 --> 12:56.328
We're not trying to win.

12:56.380 --> 12:58.313
She's only entered as our cover story.

12:58.349 --> 13:00.399
Look, if my granddaughter
is in this pageant,

13:00.451 --> 13:02.334
she is gonna win this pageant,

13:02.386 --> 13:04.202
and you can't deliver.

13:04.238 --> 13:05.354
(scoffs) Can't deliver?

13:05.406 --> 13:08.290
If I wanted to deliver, I'd
deliver all over this place.

13:08.325 --> 13:10.275
Oh, yeah, and what
are you gonna teach her

13:10.277 --> 13:12.210
for her talent portion, how to stay home

13:12.263 --> 13:15.197
on Saturday nights and eat
day-old cake over a sink?

13:15.232 --> 13:16.615
Oh, okay, and what are
you gonna teach her,

13:16.617 --> 13:19.134
how to get pregnant at
17 and marry a gay man?

13:19.186 --> 13:21.370
- Oh, yeah, it's getting real.
- Oh!

13:33.267 --> 13:34.433
Oh, my god, the note's gone.

13:34.435 --> 13:36.201
It worked!

13:36.203 --> 13:37.202
(ding)

13:39.273 --> 13:40.322
Oh, hey!

13:40.357 --> 13:42.157
I was just coming to meet you.

13:42.192 --> 13:43.258
Why don't you
just come in and...

13:43.294 --> 13:45.143
Oh, my god, I missed you!

13:47.298 --> 13:48.630
Oh, my god, get off me!

13:48.666 --> 13:50.482
I feel like I missed something.

13:51.619 --> 13:54.603
Look, Riley, we're both to blame here.

13:54.638 --> 13:57.406
I'm just so happy we can
finally get past this.

13:57.441 --> 14:00.442
And to think, it's all
'cause of this chair.

14:02.413 --> 14:03.495
Are you drunk?

14:03.497 --> 14:05.314
No!

14:05.349 --> 14:07.366
I got your note where you
said it was all your fault.

14:10.354 --> 14:11.403
I didn't write this.

14:11.438 --> 14:13.205
You know how you'd know?

14:13.257 --> 14:15.140
'Cause none of it was my fault.

14:15.142 --> 14:17.192
All right? This is your
brother's handwriting.

14:17.227 --> 14:18.577
I hope you two are very happy together.

14:23.084 --> 14:24.717
Hey, have you seen Ben?

14:24.719 --> 14:26.702
Yeah. He's over there about to show

14:26.737 --> 14:28.087
yet another girl the
inside of his mouth.

14:30.057 --> 14:32.074
Hey, Ben. Can I talk to
you for a quick second?

14:32.109 --> 14:35.010
- It's kind of important.
- Yeah, just one second.

14:35.046 --> 14:36.929
Dude, you're not gonna believe this.

14:36.931 --> 14:38.948
She's Note Girl. We
went out a few years ago.

14:38.983 --> 14:41.767
Ben, she's not Note Girl.

14:41.819 --> 14:42.818
I'm Note Girl.

14:44.905 --> 14:47.773
Danny, I don't know
where to go with this,

14:47.808 --> 14:50.793
but I guess I'll start
with "Dude, we're brothers."

14:50.845 --> 14:52.678
No, I mean I found your note

14:52.730 --> 14:53.912
and thought it was from Riley.

14:53.948 --> 14:56.131
I'm sorry, man, but that
girl didn't come here for you.

14:58.102 --> 15:00.035
You're quite the catch
these days, Romeo.

15:00.071 --> 15:01.036
I'm actually not.

15:01.088 --> 15:02.121
She was supposed to be someone else.

15:02.123 --> 15:04.023
I thought she left me a note,

15:04.025 --> 15:06.125
but afraid I'll never
find out who sent it.

15:06.127 --> 15:08.894
It was me, you idiot!

15:08.929 --> 15:09.945
It was me! It was me! It was me!

15:09.997 --> 15:10.996
I wrote the note!

15:12.049 --> 15:13.048
You did?

15:13.100 --> 15:14.850
Why didn't you sign it?

15:14.885 --> 15:16.835
Because I thought if
we were meant to be,

15:16.871 --> 15:17.853
then you would know it was me!

15:17.888 --> 15:18.904
Sam, I wanted it to be you.

15:18.939 --> 15:19.938
You were my first choice!

15:19.991 --> 15:22.725
Really? After whoever
you picked up last night,

15:22.777 --> 15:23.759
and now Heather?

15:23.794 --> 15:24.860
Heather! That's her name.

15:27.164 --> 15:28.814
- Sam, I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

15:28.866 --> 15:30.749
It wasn't enough to completely reject me

15:30.801 --> 15:32.067
while I'm naked in bed with you.

15:32.103 --> 15:33.686
You had to do it a couple more times

15:33.738 --> 15:35.004
just for good measure?

15:35.039 --> 15:36.955
Consider me humiliated.

15:36.957 --> 15:39.024
Congratulations, you finally got back

15:39.026 --> 15:41.010
at the stuck-up cheerleader
who ignored you in high school.

15:41.045 --> 15:42.928
Sam, wait, I...

15:44.048 --> 15:46.915
(applause)

15:48.903 --> 15:50.869
It's just so sad.

15:50.871 --> 15:51.920
You know how many of these girls dream

15:51.956 --> 15:54.923
of becoming models and
actresses only to fail

15:54.959 --> 15:57.693
and grab the lowest
branch that is real estate?

15:58.796 --> 16:00.112
God, that got real quick.

16:01.749 --> 16:03.749
Okay, Emma's up next.

16:03.801 --> 16:05.684
Wait, where's her wig?

16:05.686 --> 16:07.119
Do you have any idea how many dolls

16:07.154 --> 16:09.088
I had to scalp to make that thing?

16:09.140 --> 16:10.723
It doesn't matter, okay?

16:10.775 --> 16:13.625
I stayed up all night teaching
her my amazing dance routine.

16:13.677 --> 16:14.960
Step, ball, change.

16:15.012 --> 16:16.028
Step, ball, change.

16:16.063 --> 16:18.047
Yeah, well, that's
gonna be awkward because

16:18.082 --> 16:20.933
I spent all morning
teaching her my routine.

16:20.968 --> 16:24.069
Shimmy-shimmy jazz hands.
Shimmy-shimmy jazz hands.

16:24.071 --> 16:26.872
I'm her coach, it is my trophy.

16:26.907 --> 16:27.940
- Your trophy?
- Yeah.

16:27.975 --> 16:30.743
Unbelievable. You have
clearly lost sight of who's

16:30.795 --> 16:31.844
doing all the work here.

16:31.846 --> 16:33.862
Me! It is my trophy.

16:33.914 --> 16:36.849
I don't know who's
winning Tiny Darlings,

16:36.851 --> 16:39.735
but they are about to
shimmy-shimmy jazz hands

16:39.787 --> 16:43.689
their way into today's top story.

16:43.724 --> 16:46.759
- ( Yankee Doodle playing)
- Oh my god, she looks so cute.

16:46.794 --> 16:49.094
All right, come on,
Emma! Fluff those ruffles!

16:57.138 --> 17:00.022
Come on! Come on, honey!
Just like we rehearsed, okay?

17:00.074 --> 17:02.841
And big smile!

17:02.893 --> 17:03.976
And dance, Emma, dance!

17:05.863 --> 17:06.912
You look like an insane person.

17:06.914 --> 17:08.763
And I'm the one wearing a $5 wig.

17:08.799 --> 17:10.782
I've got it, I've got this,
okay? I've worked so hard.

17:10.818 --> 17:13.801
Lasso! Lasso! Lasso! Lasso!

17:13.838 --> 17:15.771
Blow a kiss, see where it goes!

17:15.806 --> 17:17.656
Blow a kiss, see where it goes!

17:17.708 --> 17:20.792
- All right, sparkle! Sparkle!
- That is it! That is it!

17:20.828 --> 17:23.796
My granddaughter is
not having fun anymore.

17:23.830 --> 17:26.682
And if she's not happy, I'm not happy.

17:26.733 --> 17:29.101
And you people should
be ashamed of yourselves,

17:29.136 --> 17:32.020
allowing a clearly deranged woman

17:32.072 --> 17:35.974
to force a toddler to do
a terrible dance routine.

17:36.010 --> 17:39.962
No! No, no, no, stop,
stop! She's got this, okay?

17:39.997 --> 17:41.914
I am winning this thing!

17:41.966 --> 17:43.782
Riley Perrin is a winner!

17:46.804 --> 17:49.688
Cheerleaders: Whoo!

17:51.826 --> 17:54.726
Look, girls, I'm sure you
all have great fake IDs,

17:54.728 --> 17:57.129
but the high school cheerleader
outfits are kind of a dead giveaway.

17:57.164 --> 17:59.798
Cheerleaders: Ready?
Okay! His name is Ben.

17:59.800 --> 18:02.034
He is a fool.

18:02.036 --> 18:03.702
Go out with him.

18:03.704 --> 18:04.970
That might be cool.

18:06.056 --> 18:09.041
Go... Ben!

18:12.096 --> 18:14.029
Ben, what the hell are you doing?

18:14.081 --> 18:15.981
You said you were done being humiliated.

18:16.016 --> 18:17.015
Well, now it's my turn.

18:17.067 --> 18:18.984
Pom-poms down!

18:18.986 --> 18:20.836
- I'm doin' this dance...
- (Clapping rhythmically)

18:20.888 --> 18:21.920
...to get another chance.

18:21.922 --> 18:23.005
Let me take you out

18:23.040 --> 18:24.990
or I'll scream and shout!

18:25.025 --> 18:26.792
I was stupid

18:26.794 --> 18:27.843
I must admit.

18:27.878 --> 18:28.844
I even learned

18:28.879 --> 18:30.696
to do the splits.

18:30.731 --> 18:34.683
Ow! Oh god. No! Ow! Ow, ow, ow, ow.

18:34.735 --> 18:35.817
You can stop now.

18:37.705 --> 18:40.055
If you're willing to
do something this crazy,

18:40.107 --> 18:43.025
then maybe I'm crazy enough
to give you a second chance.

18:43.060 --> 18:46.662
Thank you. You ever kiss
a cheerleader before?

18:46.714 --> 18:49.147
Once, but it was a dare.

18:50.951 --> 18:52.968
Cheerleaders: Whoo!

18:54.088 --> 18:56.905
No, no, no, stop, stop!
She's got this, okay?

18:56.957 --> 18:58.891
I am winning this thing!

18:58.926 --> 19:00.976
Riley Perrin is a winner!

19:01.011 --> 19:03.762
(lip syncing to himself)
This is Tucker Dobbs...

19:03.797 --> 19:05.847
revealing the horrifying
truth about parents

19:05.883 --> 19:08.667
who pathetically live
through their children.

19:08.669 --> 19:09.668
Be careful, America.

19:12.790 --> 19:14.673
Oh my god.

19:14.675 --> 19:15.724
That's me.

19:15.759 --> 19:18.694
Like that's really me.

19:18.729 --> 19:21.046
It's like I always have to win...

19:21.048 --> 19:24.983
with work, with sports, with everything.

19:25.035 --> 19:28.053
- No, what? No!
- No, you? Oh, come on!

19:28.122 --> 19:29.054
You're a little kitty kat.

19:29.106 --> 19:31.056
Yeah, you don't do...
you don't do that.

19:31.108 --> 19:33.942
That's even what I did with Danny.

19:35.062 --> 19:37.029
I have to go.

19:40.951 --> 19:42.951
Oh, hey.

19:49.076 --> 19:50.125
Thank you?

19:51.161 --> 19:55.080
Danny... I'm so sorry.

19:55.132 --> 19:59.668
I was trying to win an
argument that nobody can win.

19:59.720 --> 20:02.971
That's okay. We were both wrong.

20:04.091 --> 20:06.008
I don't wanna win anymore.

20:06.060 --> 20:08.010
Neither do I.

20:09.063 --> 20:11.063
I just wanna be with you.

20:16.646 --> 20:17.665
Ben: Can you believe it?

20:17.865 --> 20:19.832
Uncle Danny and Aunt
Riley are back together,

20:19.867 --> 20:21.711
and Daddy scored a date with Sam.

20:21.811 --> 20:23.812
But right now, I get to
spend the night

20:23.846 --> 20:25.513
with my best girl.

20:25.548 --> 20:26.614
I love you, baby.

20:26.649 --> 20:28.750
I love you, Daddy.

20:28.784 --> 20:31.019
Think you're ready
for a chair of your own?

20:31.053 --> 20:32.520
Yeah.

20:32.555 --> 20:35.123
Here we go.

20:35.157 --> 20:36.925
Can I grab you a cold one?

20:39.829 --> 20:41.296
There you go.

20:42.865 --> 20:45.033
-Cheers.
-Cheers.
