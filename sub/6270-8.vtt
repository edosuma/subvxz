00:00.068 --> 00:02.203
<i>Previously, on Witches of East End...</i>

00:02.204 --> 00:05.724
Your necklace, it's red.
This is your last life.

00:05.725 --> 00:08.182
You should probably
move along now.

00:08.183 --> 00:10.937
INGRID: You didn't have to do that.
I can take care of myself.

00:10.955 --> 00:13.491
KILLIAN: You have nothing
to worry about.

00:13.492 --> 00:15.755
I just want to make sure I'm not
getting in the middle of something.

00:15.756 --> 00:20.529
It was just a kiss, and we are never, ever
going to tell anyone because it's over.

00:20.530 --> 00:25.285
DASH: I heard you at the library.
I'm leaving early for London.

00:25.895 --> 00:28.826
I'm not your mother.
You knew me as Athena.

00:28.827 --> 00:31.790
- INGRID: Why am I here?
<i>- Serpens clavem.</i>

00:31.791 --> 00:34.509
It's a golden snake.
The tail looks like a key.

00:34.543 --> 00:38.046
I need you to convince
your aunt to give it back.

00:38.080 --> 00:40.098
INGRID: This will end if you
tell me where the snake is.

00:40.132 --> 00:41.643
WENDY:
It's gone.

00:44.480 --> 00:48.023
INGRID: She said one is your soul mate,
and the other, your destroyer?

00:48.057 --> 00:50.191
Does that mean one of them
is gonna kill you?

00:50.226 --> 00:52.672
It's a metaphor, Ingrid.
Tarot cards are tricky that way.

00:52.673 --> 00:54.424
And you think Killian
is the destroyer?

00:54.425 --> 00:57.644
Obviously. All this trouble
started the night I met him.

00:57.645 --> 01:00.935
He's the reason I lost Dash.
Damn right he's the destroyer.

01:00.953 --> 01:02.437
...what, two minutes, and...

01:02.455 --> 01:04.318
So, what are you gonna do?

01:04.319 --> 01:08.543
What <i>can</i> I do? Dash is in London.
He's not returning any of my calls.

01:08.577 --> 01:11.112
He hates me right now...
And rightfully so.

01:11.130 --> 01:12.247
(speaking angrily)

01:12.281 --> 01:13.984
(stops speaking
abruptly)

01:14.039 --> 01:16.776
- Enjoy.
- Freya, I'm so sorry.

01:16.777 --> 01:19.182
It's okay. I am not gonna
let Killian destroy me...

01:19.183 --> 01:21.556
I'm gonna trade
all this heartbreak for good.

01:21.590 --> 01:24.880
Like for that angry couple back there.
Watch.

01:24.881 --> 01:26.961
- ...something that's been going on...
- Look, I'm sorry.

01:26.979 --> 01:29.137
- Let's not do that again.
- Okay.

01:29.138 --> 01:30.986
What did you just do?

01:31.021 --> 01:33.621
Gave 'em a "Rush of Love,"
with a twist.

01:33.648 --> 01:36.200
Damn, you're good.

01:36.201 --> 01:41.289
My life may be in shambles, but at least
I can make someone else happy.

02:22.947 --> 02:25.616
- Wendy.
- Hey.

02:26.423 --> 02:29.375
- Hey.
- What's up?

02:34.294 --> 02:37.163
I need to show
you something,

02:37.181 --> 02:40.183
and, uh...

02:40.544 --> 02:43.629
(sighs) I don't want you
to get angry with me.

02:44.665 --> 02:47.722
Okay, why would
I be angry?

02:49.526 --> 02:51.611
(gasps)

02:51.645 --> 02:53.446
The portal key!?

02:53.753 --> 02:56.682
What the hell! You said
that was destroyed.

02:56.700 --> 02:59.368
- I lied.
- You lied...?

02:59.403 --> 03:03.507
I was killed over that key!
I'm on my last life now.

03:03.508 --> 03:05.747
- I am so sorry.
- You're <i>so</i> sorry!

03:05.748 --> 03:08.657
You promised me that you
were not gonna get angry.

03:08.658 --> 03:09.858
No, I didn't.

03:09.859 --> 03:11.943
- I heard you!
- No, I didn't!

03:11.944 --> 03:14.546
What are you doing, Joanna?
What happened?

03:14.580 --> 03:17.449
And why did the shifter
think that <i>I</i> stole it?

03:20.169 --> 03:23.288
I have no idea.
I don't know.

03:23.306 --> 03:27.792
- Jo...
- Archibald wanted it, for sure.

03:27.810 --> 03:30.729
- Yeah?
- And he even suspected that we had it,

03:30.763 --> 03:32.835
but he's never figured
out where it was,

03:32.836 --> 03:34.750
and I've kept it hidden
for centuries.

03:34.751 --> 03:36.835
The shifter knows
where we live, Joanna.

03:36.836 --> 03:39.421
- Wendy, I messed up.
- Yeah, you messed up.

03:39.526 --> 03:42.842
You told me that thing was destroyed
after we sealed the portal.

03:42.859 --> 03:46.144
- I believed you.
- I know. And like I said...

03:46.162 --> 03:47.579
You lied.

03:47.613 --> 03:51.116
(sighs)
Why would you keep that snake?

03:51.150 --> 03:52.584
It's...

03:52.618 --> 03:55.965
Seductive and corrupting
and poisonous.

03:55.966 --> 03:58.439
You and I both know
what it does to people.

03:58.440 --> 04:00.691
Why would you keep it
this whole time?

04:02.845 --> 04:05.263
You thought that you
might use it again someday.

04:05.298 --> 04:09.634
Unbelievable! And you
call <i>me</i> the reckless one.

04:09.668 --> 04:13.438
You know that we can never
go back there, Joanna.

04:13.473 --> 04:17.149
Why would you want to?
Our lives so much better here.

04:17.220 --> 04:19.988
I've never used it, Wendy,
I don't plan to use it,

04:20.023 --> 04:24.326
but I'm not getting rid of it...
It is my only connection with our home.

04:24.361 --> 04:26.328
(exhales)

04:26.363 --> 04:28.387
ECHOING WHISPER:
Wendy...

04:28.403 --> 04:31.405
I don't feel good
about this.

04:35.538 --> 04:39.258
- Hey. Sorry I'm late.
- Hey. Oh, no problem, no problem.

04:39.292 --> 04:41.877
So, what happened?
Is Freya's wedding off?

04:41.911 --> 04:43.429
Maybe. Probably.

04:43.463 --> 04:46.265
Oh, I just wish there was
something I could do to help.

04:46.299 --> 04:48.477
Well, if it makes
you feel better,

04:48.478 --> 04:50.436
there's someone else
here that you can help.

04:50.470 --> 04:52.159
Do they want to
check out a book?

04:52.185 --> 04:54.669
Seems like he wants
to check <i>you</i> out.

04:55.925 --> 04:58.360
INGRID:
Oh, that's just Mike.

04:58.395 --> 05:01.697
That's the guy that saved you
in the Civil War aisle?

05:01.731 --> 05:03.532
You didn't tell me
how cute he was.

05:03.903 --> 05:06.819
- You think so?
- BARB: Yeah.

05:08.604 --> 05:11.606
Barb, no,
I'm-I'm not in the market.

05:11.624 --> 05:13.775
Oh, well, I'm not telling
you to marry him.

05:13.793 --> 05:15.911
I'm not even telling
you to date him.

05:15.945 --> 05:19.968
But I <i>am</i> telling you to go
over there and help him.

05:20.300 --> 05:21.750
Mm-hmm.

05:22.836 --> 05:24.720
Hey, Mike.

05:24.754 --> 05:28.941
- Ingrid, I am so glad to see you.
- What's going on?

05:28.942 --> 05:31.779
I hear you know a lot about
the history of East End.

05:31.780 --> 05:34.060
I have studied some, yes.
What do you want to know?

05:34.061 --> 05:35.384
Everything.

05:35.385 --> 05:39.399
My novel is historical fiction, set here
at the turn of the 20th century,

05:39.400 --> 05:42.237
and I could really use some
insight from an expert.

05:42.272 --> 05:46.348
(laughs): Well, I'm not sure I'm an
expert, but I would be happy to help.

05:46.809 --> 05:48.160
Great.

05:50.962 --> 05:52.596
Hey.

05:54.546 --> 05:56.931
How's Dash's hand?

06:00.402 --> 06:02.086
I said hello.

06:02.121 --> 06:05.923
We're out of tequila. I think
there's some more upstairs.

06:07.543 --> 06:10.378
So what, you're just...
not gonna talk to me?

06:10.412 --> 06:13.157
I just did. I said
we're out of tequila.

06:13.171 --> 06:16.471
(quiet laugh) How can
you be mad at me?

06:16.472 --> 06:19.226
None of this is my fault.
I didn't tell Dash what happened.

06:19.227 --> 06:22.856
Can you honestly look me in the eye and
say you are not happy that he found out?

06:22.857 --> 06:24.164
This is what you wanted
to have happen...

06:24.190 --> 06:25.400
Stop...

06:25.401 --> 06:27.017
Putting this on me.

06:27.018 --> 06:28.542
Look, I've done
everything you asked.

06:28.543 --> 06:32.172
You wanted to be friends, we're friends.
You told me to move on, I moved on.

06:32.724 --> 06:35.349
Stop treating me like
<i>I</i> screwed up <i>your</i> life.

06:35.350 --> 06:37.783
You did!
You destroyed it!

06:39.303 --> 06:41.891
You think I want my
brother to hate me?

06:42.479 --> 06:44.339
You think I want
<i>you</i> to hate me?

06:44.340 --> 06:47.130
I don't know what you want.
I don't think <i>you</i> know what you want.

06:47.131 --> 06:50.923
I think this whole thing is a game
to you, and I am not doing it anymore.

06:58.168 --> 06:59.600
Hi.

07:05.258 --> 07:06.804
(sighs) Amy...

07:06.805 --> 07:09.997
Sorry, I thought I would
surprise you at work.

07:10.553 --> 07:12.170
Surprise.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.369
Maybe we shouldn't wait
until sundown to bury it.

07:35.416 --> 07:38.447
Maybe we shouldn't bury it at all.
I think we should just burn it.

07:38.448 --> 07:41.336
Would you feel more comfortable if
I took care of this without you?

07:41.337 --> 07:43.711
No, I'd feel more comfortable
if it didn't exist.

07:44.555 --> 07:47.540
You saw what it did
to our father.

07:48.516 --> 07:50.596
It killed everything good
inside of him.

07:50.597 --> 07:54.238
We're not getting rid of it, so you
can stop looking at me like that.

07:54.272 --> 07:58.909
Listen, Joanna,
I-I understand why you kept it.

07:58.944 --> 08:00.811
I do.

08:00.829 --> 08:03.414
You thought if you waited long
enough, that maybe someday

08:03.448 --> 08:05.364
you could use it so you
could see Frederick again.

08:05.365 --> 08:08.729
- I don't want to talk about Frederick.
- You never want to talk about him.

08:08.958 --> 08:10.592
I know that you miss him.

08:10.626 --> 08:14.121
I don't want to talk about it. I should
never have told you about the key.

08:14.130 --> 08:16.548
So just leave it alone,
and I'll take care of it.

08:43.864 --> 08:46.208
(whispering) <i>Wendy...</i>

09:04.535 --> 09:05.958
(screams)

09:08.715 --> 09:10.423
(screams)

09:13.781 --> 09:16.184
(gasping breaths)
What did you do?!

09:16.211 --> 09:18.396
It attacked me.
Get it off right now.

09:18.431 --> 09:20.568
- Ow, ow, ow!
- I'm trying. I don't want to hurt you.

09:20.599 --> 09:23.401
What the hell happened!
Did you look in its eyes?

09:23.436 --> 09:25.928
You know you are not supposed to
look in its eyes.

09:25.929 --> 09:29.056
Okay, I am really, <i>really</i> not in the
mood for one of your lectures right now.

09:29.074 --> 09:30.900
<i>Dimitte serpens.</i>

09:30.901 --> 09:33.111
This snake is a powerful
vessel of pure evil.

09:33.112 --> 09:36.581
I think we need something a little
stronger than off-the-cuff Latin commands!

09:36.615 --> 09:38.206
Let's try sarcasm;
that should help.

09:38.233 --> 09:39.701
Let me get the Grimoire.

09:39.735 --> 09:41.135
(gasps) Joanna.

09:41.136 --> 09:43.120
Look.

09:44.874 --> 09:47.494
Stay right there. I'm getting the book.
We'll figure this out.

09:47.495 --> 09:48.770
Hurry.

09:48.904 --> 09:51.256
(gasping breaths)

09:53.215 --> 09:55.416
(panting)

09:57.085 --> 09:59.086
(moaning exhale)

10:05.594 --> 10:08.446
♪

10:08.481 --> 10:11.449
- Look, Killian...
- Oh, God.

10:11.484 --> 10:15.470
No good conversation ever
started with "Look, Killian..."

10:15.471 --> 10:19.024
I really like you.
I do. A lot.

10:19.143 --> 10:23.163
I have a thing for lost souls.
I'm-I'm a sucker for them.

10:23.197 --> 10:25.513
But I don't think
I'm the one who can find you.

10:25.514 --> 10:28.635
- If this is because Freya, I told you...
- You did.

10:28.652 --> 10:31.297
You told me that you don't
have feelings for her.

10:31.298 --> 10:35.792
And you can lie to me if you want,
but you should stop lying to yourself.

10:40.646 --> 10:42.280
Good luck, Killian.

10:53.486 --> 10:55.454
Okay, what else
have you got?

10:55.488 --> 10:56.788
- Come on.
- Hit me.

10:56.823 --> 10:59.983
- You finished those already?
- I am an unbelievably fast note-taker.

10:59.984 --> 11:01.796
- It's-it's quite a skill.
- Wow.

11:01.797 --> 11:04.696
I don't know how many more history
books on East End that we have.

11:04.714 --> 11:07.121
I'm actually looking
for something more about...

11:07.122 --> 11:10.784
The occult. Witchcraft, curses,
spirits, that kind of thing.

11:10.785 --> 11:11.859
Why?

11:11.885 --> 11:13.555
Well, I'm sure
you're already aware of this,

11:13.589 --> 11:16.975
but this town has a long history
of supernatural legends,

11:17.009 --> 11:20.211
from the early settlers
to the witch burnings on to...

11:20.229 --> 11:22.052
Archibald Browning
and his cult at Fair Haven.

11:22.053 --> 11:24.349
You know, East End
is also famous for being one

11:24.383 --> 11:27.352
of the best pumpkin-growing
towns on the Eastern Seaboard.

11:27.386 --> 11:29.053
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

11:29.071 --> 11:32.324
BARB: Uh, Ingrid wrote
her dissertation about witchcraft.

11:32.358 --> 11:34.567
Interesting. She didn't...
mention it to me.

11:34.568 --> 11:36.703
It's not something I usually
slip into conversation

11:36.729 --> 11:37.992
unless I want to
bore someone.

11:37.993 --> 11:39.744
- She also does witchcraft.
- Barb, stop.

11:39.778 --> 11:41.688
- No, Barb, continue.
- INGRID: This is stupid.

11:41.697 --> 11:43.497
BARB:
She got me pregnant.

11:43.532 --> 11:45.802
Okay. No, that
sounds wrong.

11:45.803 --> 11:49.244
I meant she did a fertility spell
for me that made it possible.

11:49.245 --> 11:51.372
INGRID: It was a fake spell
I got off the Internet

11:51.373 --> 11:52.990
probably written
by an 11-year-old boy.

11:53.008 --> 11:54.925
It had nothing to do
with you getting pregnant.

11:54.960 --> 11:56.493
There's no such thing
as witchcraft.

11:56.511 --> 11:58.262
BARB: Well, tell that
to this thing inside me

11:58.296 --> 12:00.831
that makes me throw up
every morning.

12:00.849 --> 12:02.932
(chuckles) She's funny.

12:02.965 --> 12:04.900
Sounds like we have a lot more
to talk about.

12:04.934 --> 12:07.569
Uh, actually, no. I got a lot
of work to do right now.

12:07.604 --> 12:09.321
Well, I'm not going anywhere.

12:10.243 --> 12:12.457
- Okay.
- So, we can talk later.

12:12.458 --> 12:14.622
- Yes.
- All right.

12:16.529 --> 12:18.980
(exhales)

12:25.121 --> 12:29.359
- Didn't I just see Amy? Where is she?
- She left. Just broke up with her.

12:29.377 --> 12:30.789
What? Why?

12:30.790 --> 12:34.131
Well, I felt like she was interested
in something serious and...

12:34.166 --> 12:35.920
I'm not.

12:36.379 --> 12:38.864
What are you doing, Killian?

12:38.984 --> 12:41.236
- What do you mean?
- I mean, here.

12:41.237 --> 12:43.707
With your life.
Why are you even still here?

12:43.708 --> 12:45.976
Why be here at all
if you're just hurting people?

12:46.011 --> 12:49.563
I don't think you're in
a position to judge me, Freya.

12:53.401 --> 12:57.105
- Is there a Freya Beauchamp here?
- Yeah, just over there.

12:58.940 --> 13:01.001
- These are for you.
- Oh.

13:01.002 --> 13:03.453
- I just need you to sign.
- Thanks.

13:06.865 --> 13:08.332
Oh, my...

13:08.366 --> 13:09.917
(gasps)

13:09.951 --> 13:12.203
(exhales)

13:13.544 --> 13:15.660
Oh, my God. They're from Dash.

13:15.661 --> 13:17.708
You sure about that?
No name on the card.

13:17.742 --> 13:20.544
Of course they're from Dash.
Who else would they be from?

13:20.578 --> 13:22.379
(exhales)

13:22.413 --> 13:24.859
Oh, my God.
(sniffs)

13:24.892 --> 13:26.555
Ow.

13:30.806 --> 13:32.223
Got it.

13:32.257 --> 13:34.225
Wendy, don't worry.

13:34.259 --> 13:36.143
I have an idea.

13:38.480 --> 13:40.566
Wendy...?

13:48.657 --> 13:50.457
Killian.

13:50.492 --> 13:52.126
- Hey, Mom.
- Oh...

13:52.713 --> 13:55.629
- Are you ready to go?
- Yeah, sure. Freya.

13:55.664 --> 13:57.916
I'm going out on my break.
Be back in an hour.

13:58.307 --> 14:00.467
Penelope,
it's so nice to see you.

14:00.502 --> 14:03.754
Dear, are you all right?

14:03.788 --> 14:06.557
- You look terrible.
- What?

14:06.591 --> 14:09.625
- KILLIAN: Seriously, what's wrong?
- What do you mean?

14:09.626 --> 14:12.015
Well, for one thing, you keep...
swaying.

14:12.041 --> 14:14.315
- Oh, I do?
- You look positively green.

14:14.349 --> 14:16.433
Come with me.
I'm taking you home.

14:16.467 --> 14:19.027
Oh, I... My shift isn't over.

14:19.028 --> 14:20.609
I insist.

14:20.655 --> 14:22.239
I'm sure Killian can cover
for you.

14:22.240 --> 14:23.929
We'll have to take a rain check
on our lunch.

14:23.930 --> 14:25.897
Yeah, of course.
No problem.

14:26.355 --> 14:27.944
But I can't leave work.

14:27.945 --> 14:29.530
You can't stay here
if you're getting sick.

14:29.531 --> 14:30.981
Now come on, dear.

14:32.182 --> 14:35.744
- I promise to take very good care of you.
- FREYA: Okay.

14:41.326 --> 14:42.659
Hey.

14:42.677 --> 14:44.661
- You okay?
- Yeah.

14:44.679 --> 14:47.681
I found a spell
that may work.

14:47.716 --> 14:50.684
I have what we need
but I'll need to... prepare.

14:50.719 --> 14:53.804
I think we can save the key
if we get it right.

14:53.838 --> 14:56.340
I don't think
that'll be necessary.

14:56.506 --> 15:00.344
- Wendy...
- This key is the answer to our problems.

15:00.345 --> 15:03.180
- We can use it to go back home.
- Wendy, stop.

15:03.198 --> 15:04.949
The venom's getting to you.

15:04.950 --> 15:06.708
We just talked about it.
We can't go back.

15:06.709 --> 15:08.135
Maybe it's safe by now.

15:08.150 --> 15:12.337
Look at me. It'll never be safe.
That's why I haven't used the serpent.

15:12.338 --> 15:17.107
- Maybe you're wrong.
- You know we didn't leave by choice.

15:17.108 --> 15:20.774
Our father banished us to this world
when he came into power.

15:20.775 --> 15:21.974
- But...
- No!

15:21.975 --> 15:25.267
He said if we ever returned
to Asgard, he will kill us.

15:25.301 --> 15:27.128
But maybe he's changed.

15:27.152 --> 15:30.154
- He hasn't changed.
- You don't know that.

15:30.417 --> 15:34.935
I have one life left, Joanna, and I don't
want to spend it here. I want to go home.

15:35.046 --> 15:38.815
- You're immortal. You don't understand.
- Wendy, please listen,

15:38.936 --> 15:40.522
I need you to focus.

15:40.523 --> 15:42.974
- If I could just get to the portal...
- No!

15:42.992 --> 15:45.426
Absolutely not.

15:45.661 --> 15:51.464
If that portal opens, we have no idea what
may come through from the other side!

15:52.903 --> 15:56.573
(gasps) The snake is seducing you
to get what it wants.

15:56.574 --> 16:00.788
- It only wants to open the portal.
- That's all <i>I</i> want.

16:00.789 --> 16:03.070
I miss my home.
It was better there.

16:03.071 --> 16:06.975
I miss it, too, Wendy, but
it's not the same place anymore.

16:07.356 --> 16:09.790
<i>- Claude ianuas!</i>
- No!

16:12.557 --> 16:14.141

16:14.175 --> 16:16.096

You are such a bitch.

16:35.173 --> 16:37.658
Grow up, Joanna.

16:38.261 --> 16:41.474
You can't keep me
in here forever.

16:45.528 --> 16:49.020
I will break this spell eventually.
You know I will.

16:54.225 --> 16:56.193
This has nothing to do with you.

16:56.227 --> 16:58.445
(shouts, grunts)

16:58.480 --> 17:00.147
(gasps, screams)

17:00.181 --> 17:04.367
- (grunts) I'm trying to help you.
- You can help me by letting me go!

17:04.402 --> 17:06.619

17:06.655 --> 17:08.454
(shouts)

17:08.490 --> 17:10.022

17:10.040 --> 17:13.026
We have got to get this thing
off of you.

17:13.044 --> 17:16.163
Are you kidding me?!

17:16.196 --> 17:18.214
(panting)

17:18.249 --> 17:20.550
You don't care about me.

17:20.585 --> 17:23.829
You didn't speak to me
for over a hundred years.

17:24.923 --> 17:27.208
I guess you're a
coldhearted bitch.

17:27.231 --> 17:29.977
(panting)
Just ask Frederick.

17:30.011 --> 17:33.814
Oh, that's right. You can't.
Because you left him behind.

17:33.848 --> 17:35.482
You abandoned your only son.

17:35.517 --> 17:38.018
- That is not true.
- It's not?

17:38.052 --> 17:39.820
You didn't abandon him?

17:39.854 --> 17:44.165
(clatter) He refused to come with us.
You know that he was turned against me.

17:44.526 --> 17:46.994
You know, for somebody...

17:47.028 --> 17:49.830
supposedly so nurturing,

17:49.864 --> 17:52.899
all you seem to do
is destroy people.

17:52.917 --> 17:55.902
That's why you can't
talk about Frederick.

17:55.920 --> 17:59.289
Because you can't deal
with what you did to him.

18:00.592 --> 18:04.928
Or maybe you...
just don't care.

18:06.715 --> 18:09.098
It broke my heart, Wendy.

18:09.099 --> 18:12.753
There's not a day that goes by
that I don't regret leaving him there.

18:12.771 --> 18:14.421
What do you think
the girls are gonna say

18:14.439 --> 18:17.691
when I tell them that you left
their brother behind?

18:17.726 --> 18:19.777
- Stop it.
- Oh, that's right.

18:19.811 --> 18:21.562
It doesn't really matter,
does it?

18:21.596 --> 18:24.364
Because they're gonna
die soon anyway.

18:24.399 --> 18:27.568
It always happens around
this time. Right, Joanna?

18:27.602 --> 18:30.037
(chuckles)

18:31.399 --> 18:34.625
Ticktock. Ticktock.

18:34.659 --> 18:37.544
- Ticktock.
- That's enough.

18:37.579 --> 18:39.246

18:50.091 --> 18:55.295
- I feel worse. What's wrong with me?
- Drink this tea. It'll help.

18:55.773 --> 19:00.017
- I can't feel my arms.
- Oh, well, let me help.

19:02.020 --> 19:04.154

19:04.189 --> 19:08.442
- Dash sent me flowers today.
- Oh, that's wonderful, dear.

19:08.476 --> 19:12.112
- That must mean he forgives you.
- He's my soul mate.

19:12.463 --> 19:16.483
Of course he is.
Have some more.

19:18.953 --> 19:21.590
I just feel so sleepy.

19:22.207 --> 19:24.174
I'm gonna lay down.

19:24.714 --> 19:28.183
Oh, that's good.
You sleep.

19:28.184 --> 19:29.546

20:15.830 --> 20:17.544
I did not tell you
about my dissertation,

20:17.562 --> 20:20.046
but you didn't tell me
you're a published author.

20:20.064 --> 20:22.399
I can't believe there's a library
that actually stocks this.

20:22.433 --> 20:24.370
It wasn't exactly
a bestseller.

Well, we have it, and I would
like for you to sign it for me.

if you don't.

20:35.385 --> 20:37.898
Thank you.
So, what's it about?

20:37.916 --> 20:40.319

get to read your dissertation?

Oh, no. That is not happening.

21:03.469 --> 21:04.761
Why not?

21:05.199 --> 21:10.326

of witchcraft was kind of ridiculous.

Mm-mm. I'm a rational skeptic,

actually connected to this very town.

this other world

Hope it is.

24:29.801 --> 24:32.412
My father spent his entire

this mythical world was a real place.

24:41.473 --> 24:43.924
Of course, people
thought he was insane.

24:43.942 --> 24:47.778
And eventually it came true...
He did lose his mind.

24:48.328 --> 24:49.973
I'm so sorry.

24:49.974 --> 24:52.725
No. It's okay.
He died a couple years ago,

24:52.726 --> 24:56.237
but before he went,
he shared his work with me,

24:56.238 --> 25:01.750
and... the scary thing is,
it all makes sense.

25:02.410 --> 25:05.112
I have to prove
my father wasn't crazy.

25:05.130 --> 25:06.797
(sighs) I've been
going through his work,

25:06.832 --> 25:08.905
putting together the pieces,
connecting the dots,

25:08.906 --> 25:11.674
and what I think I've discovered
is: the door to Asgard

25:11.675 --> 25:14.421
is here, in East End.

25:17.166 --> 25:20.252
PENELOPE: <i>Potionem... hanc...</i>

25:20.253 --> 25:21.554
<i>tollam...</i>

25:21.579 --> 25:23.246
<i>viribus...</i>

25:23.279 --> 25:25.114
<i>tuis.</i>

25:29.152 --> 25:32.070
<i>Dona mihi...</i>

25:33.105 --> 25:34.940
<i>...ero.</i>

25:44.784 --> 25:47.252
You're starting
to really piss me off, Wendy.

25:47.286 --> 25:49.454
This ends right now!

25:49.472 --> 25:53.225
(panting): Oh, it will...
But not the way you hope.

25:53.259 --> 25:56.327
You had this key
the whole time!

25:56.346 --> 26:00.775
We didn't have to be stuck here,
where we're persecuted,

26:00.776 --> 26:02.976
where we have to hide
our true nature.

26:02.977 --> 26:05.062
Why don't you want to go back?!

26:05.096 --> 26:08.899
- Because we're safer here than there.
- Not for long.

26:08.933 --> 26:10.491
<i>Axicia volant!</i>

26:13.179 --> 26:15.163
Ooh, nice reflexes, babe.

26:15.164 --> 26:18.677
You keep that thing on much longer,
you'll never be yourself again.

26:18.993 --> 26:22.162
It's been pumping poison into
your veins this whole time.

26:22.188 --> 26:23.978
Then you'll have to destroy
it to get it off me,

26:23.979 --> 26:26.806
and I know that you can't
because of Frederick.

26:27.368 --> 26:29.936
So I guess you're in a bit
of a pickle, aren't you?

26:29.937 --> 26:33.786
- Wendy... come on.
<i>- Omnia telavolant!</i>

26:37.628 --> 26:39.162
(laughs)

26:44.519 --> 26:46.520
(sighs)

26:48.005 --> 26:49.439
<i>Axicia...</i>

26:49.474 --> 26:51.970
<i>interficiam serpens.</i>

26:57.769 --> 27:01.706
My father found this
on a dig in Peru.

27:01.740 --> 27:04.242
He believed
that this...

27:04.276 --> 27:07.082
was a map to Asgard.

27:07.496 --> 27:10.715
As you can see, though,
it's very faded.

27:11.142 --> 27:13.672
That is an interesting symbol.

27:13.673 --> 27:17.203
- What did he think that meant?
- Uh, he didn't know.

27:17.204 --> 27:21.225
He thought it had something to do with
witchcraft, but... he couldn't crack it.

27:21.260 --> 27:23.294
I haven't figured it out,
either, but...

27:23.312 --> 27:25.263
that's not gonna
stop me from trying.

27:32.255 --> 27:34.256
(whooshing)

27:36.492 --> 27:38.493
(whooshing)

27:45.617 --> 27:48.669
DASH (calls): Hello?
Anybody home?

27:50.133 --> 27:52.518
Mom, are you here?

27:53.825 --> 27:56.866
- What's going on?
- Hurry! Get your medical bag!

27:59.325 --> 28:02.708
INGRID: Well, it sure seems like you have
a lot of material for this book of yours.

28:02.709 --> 28:03.818
I know.

28:03.827 --> 28:05.944
I should probably
get going.

28:05.945 --> 28:08.213
There's just one more book
I need to look at.

28:08.214 --> 28:10.106
I'll be right back.

28:17.013 --> 28:18.630
(inhales)

28:18.648 --> 28:20.649
(whispers):
<i>Ostende te.</i>

28:26.039 --> 28:28.030
Whoa.

28:28.358 --> 28:29.825
(footsteps approaching)

28:29.859 --> 28:31.994
(whispers):
<i>Absconde Te.</i>

28:32.028 --> 28:33.923
- See anything interesting on there?
- No.

28:33.924 --> 28:37.045
It, uh... I think you're right,
it's just too worn out.

28:37.046 --> 28:38.246
Yeah.

28:41.481 --> 28:43.203
PENELOPE (hoarsely):
What's wrong with her?

28:43.204 --> 28:45.343
I can barely feel the pulse.
What the hell happened here?

28:45.344 --> 28:49.460
I-I don't know. We were having tea,
and she just suddenly collapsed.

28:49.461 --> 28:51.128
- How long ago?
- I don't know,

28:51.129 --> 28:55.152
just... one or two minutes before
you got here. Should I call 911?

28:55.153 --> 28:57.483
She's in anaphylaxis.
Her blood pressure's dropping.

28:57.484 --> 29:00.566
Her breathing's labored. I can
practically hear her throat closing up.

29:00.567 --> 29:02.067
What are you going to do?

29:02.068 --> 29:04.745
She needs a shot
of epinephrine, now.

29:07.205 --> 29:08.405
(gasps)

29:10.903 --> 29:13.702
WENDY: <i>Aperio! Aperio!</i>

29:13.703 --> 29:14.903
Wendy?

29:14.904 --> 29:16.104
<i>Aperio!</i>

29:16.105 --> 29:18.573
- You'll never get out.
- Watch me.

29:19.626 --> 29:21.710
(gasps)

29:21.744 --> 29:23.807
(cries out)

29:23.808 --> 29:25.914
So, now you're trapped, too.

29:25.915 --> 29:28.062
- Let me go.
- Let me go, and I will.

29:28.063 --> 29:31.115
No. I can't do that.

29:35.486 --> 29:37.643
Well, your blood pressure's
normal, so that's good.

29:37.644 --> 29:39.194
Oh, thank God.

29:39.763 --> 29:41.230
What did you eat today?

29:41.264 --> 29:43.365
I mean, what do you think
could've caused this?

29:43.399 --> 29:46.068
I don't know. It's just...
it's all so foggy.

29:46.102 --> 29:48.237
I'm just glad you got here
when you did.

29:48.271 --> 29:50.494
Yeah, we should probably get you
to the hospital, though, just to be safe.

29:50.520 --> 29:53.125
No, no, no, no. I'm okay.
Really.

29:53.159 --> 29:55.961
You let me know if you
need anything, all right?

29:59.165 --> 30:01.583
(sighs)

30:04.254 --> 30:07.422
So, how did you get back
from London so fast?

30:07.456 --> 30:09.341
I didn't go to the conference.

30:10.677 --> 30:12.227
I flew to London,

30:12.262 --> 30:15.521
I got off the plane and...

30:15.536 --> 30:17.599
I just couldn't do it.

30:17.633 --> 30:19.234
Couldn't do what?

30:19.269 --> 30:23.138
I couldn't sit through all those seminars
knowing things weren't settled with us.

30:23.156 --> 30:28.660
I couldn't have this... an ocean between
us knowing things weren't okay.

30:29.023 --> 30:33.693
So I turned around
and I came right back.

30:35.298 --> 30:38.170
I came back to tell you
that I can't marry you.

30:38.818 --> 30:40.686
Not after what you did.

30:42.190 --> 30:44.128
Oh.

30:44.677 --> 30:46.612
Okay.

30:47.595 --> 30:49.798
And then I saw you...

30:50.912 --> 30:52.801
About to die...

30:54.187 --> 30:59.170
And I realized that I don't want to live
in a world where you don't exist.

30:59.274 --> 31:01.405
The thought is unbearable.

31:03.730 --> 31:06.815
It's unbearable to me, too.

31:06.849 --> 31:11.492
I thought I lost you and it was
like my life was destroyed.

31:12.203 --> 31:15.956
I will never hurt you again.
I promise.

31:16.800 --> 31:19.299
Just promise you'll never scare
me like that again either.

31:19.300 --> 31:21.751
(laughs, sniffles)
I promise.

31:22.031 --> 31:23.882
I love you, Freya.

31:23.916 --> 31:26.991
- Always.
- I love you, too.

31:35.518 --> 31:38.485
Thank you for keeping this place
open so late for me.

31:38.486 --> 31:42.302
No problem. This is what
counts as rebellious for me.

31:42.303 --> 31:43.687
(chuckles)

31:43.722 --> 31:45.589
Hey, I hope I didn't
freak you out

31:45.607 --> 31:50.444
with all that talk of mythical cities,
and magical portals and witches.

31:50.478 --> 31:52.694
I swear I'm not as crazy
as I seem at first.

31:52.695 --> 31:54.213
No, I don't think
you're crazy.

31:54.214 --> 31:56.933
I just think we have
different interests.

31:56.934 --> 32:00.270
I left all that witch stuff
behind a long time ago,

32:00.288 --> 32:03.607
so, I don't know how much
more help I can be to you.

32:03.867 --> 32:05.582
Okay.

32:06.244 --> 32:09.639
Ingrid, you're not angry
about something, are you?

32:09.686 --> 32:11.399
'Cause I'm sorry
if I said something...

32:11.400 --> 32:15.256
No, not at all. I think I'm just tired.
Long night.

32:16.337 --> 32:18.922
I get it, and I owe you one.

32:18.956 --> 32:23.310
If you decide to finish your dissertation,
I'd be more than happy to help.

32:23.755 --> 32:27.482
- Good night.
- Night.

32:31.770 --> 32:34.655
(door opens, closes)

32:46.065 --> 32:48.400
(insects chirring, owl hooting)

32:48.434 --> 32:51.700
You know, all you have to do is open
the door, and this will all be over.

32:51.701 --> 32:53.626
Just let me go on my way.

32:54.248 --> 32:57.131
- You never have to see me again.
- I won't do it.

32:58.033 --> 33:01.192
Okay. Then I'll strangle you
(speaks indistinctly)

33:01.193 --> 33:03.077
until you pass out

33:03.078 --> 33:07.133
and I'll take you through the portal
and I'll offer you as a sacrifice.

33:07.186 --> 33:08.937
(panting)

33:08.971 --> 33:11.907
You'll die, I'll live.

33:11.941 --> 33:15.327
Oh, this key is giving me
so much more strength.

33:15.361 --> 33:17.579
I like it.

33:17.613 --> 33:21.249
This shouldn't take
much time.

33:21.284 --> 33:23.144
(weakly):
<i>Ianua.</i>

33:27.173 --> 33:28.924
No...!

33:31.018 --> 33:32.228
(whimpering):
Joanna!

33:33.454 --> 33:34.871
<i>Dissolvere.</i>

33:37.500 --> 33:38.833
(screams)

33:38.851 --> 33:40.502
(whimpers)

33:40.520 --> 33:42.888
(fork clatters)

33:44.223 --> 33:46.641
(Wendy whimpering)

33:57.778 --> 34:00.146
(sniffles, pants)

34:00.570 --> 34:03.125
(cries quietly)

34:03.877 --> 34:05.692
You're okay.

34:06.996 --> 34:09.797
This should stop
the bleeding.

34:09.831 --> 34:11.533
(inhales sharply)

34:11.551 --> 34:15.554
And I'll...
I'll heal you later.

34:18.424 --> 34:22.877
I just... I'm just going
to take a minute.

34:35.638 --> 34:41.011
- FREYA: Will you stop it. I'm fine.
- Let me do my job. Please.

34:42.156 --> 34:43.362
All right.

34:43.362 --> 34:46.985
I want to get you to the hospital
tomorrow, run some blood tests.

34:47.226 --> 34:48.987
Yes, Doctor.

34:49.203 --> 34:50.875
I'm not kidding.

34:50.969 --> 34:52.538
I know.

34:52.556 --> 34:55.341
Look, what happened tonight
was serious.

34:55.998 --> 34:58.134
You know, I almost lost you.

34:59.638 --> 35:01.681
Do you believe in fate?

35:02.545 --> 35:04.247
Not really.

35:04.442 --> 35:06.385
Well, I do.

35:06.772 --> 35:10.258
I believe certain things
are written in the stars.

35:10.276 --> 35:12.110
Like us.

35:12.144 --> 35:15.096
We're meant to be.

35:15.114 --> 35:18.125
I can't wait to call you
my wife.

35:24.123 --> 35:29.127
But you need to get some rest.
I'm gonna take a shower.

35:37.321 --> 35:39.623
Hey, I'm gonna start
a fire, okay?

35:39.657 --> 35:43.176
Use the matches next
to the fireplace.

35:43.958 --> 35:45.958
<i>Luce, igni!</i>

35:53.583 --> 35:56.635
Uh... matches come toward me.

35:59.894 --> 36:02.029
Um...

36:02.063 --> 36:05.565
<i>Veniat ad me arca archa.</i>

36:08.536 --> 36:10.821
What is...?

36:10.855 --> 36:12.706
Wh...?

36:47.470 --> 36:49.576
I'm so sorry
for everything I said.

36:49.610 --> 36:52.258
It wasn't your fault...
it was the snake.

36:52.613 --> 36:54.998
Yeah, but because of me,

36:55.033 --> 36:58.818
you destroyed your only chance
to ever see your son again.

36:58.819 --> 37:03.410
It was either that or let
you be a monster forever.

37:11.466 --> 37:14.879
I understand if you hate me.

37:15.553 --> 37:18.251
It wasn't your fault.

37:18.439 --> 37:22.859
You were right, I should have destroyed
the key a long time ago.

37:22.894 --> 37:26.063
I was just... I was just
holding onto the hope

37:26.097 --> 37:29.721
that I might see my
son again someday.

37:29.915 --> 37:33.453
But it wasn't real.
It was...

37:33.454 --> 37:36.272
It was just a hope and...

37:37.959 --> 37:41.661
I mean, I hate to admit it...

37:44.132 --> 37:47.039
...He really is gone.

37:47.851 --> 37:50.269
He's gone.

37:57.253 --> 38:01.317
I think about him all the time.
I miss him so much.

38:01.318 --> 38:02.518
(sniffles)

38:03.476 --> 38:05.477
So do I.

38:10.998 --> 38:12.560
I'm sorry.

38:17.815 --> 38:20.000
Hey.

38:20.034 --> 38:22.986
What the hell happened in here?

38:22.987 --> 38:26.082
- It's nothing.
- Long story.

38:26.764 --> 38:28.716
What about you?
How was your day?

38:28.747 --> 38:30.915
Strange.

38:30.933 --> 38:33.351
Is there a real place
called Asgard?

38:33.385 --> 38:36.354
(low):
I'm gonna throw up.

38:36.388 --> 38:38.589
Oh, my God, it's true.

38:39.260 --> 38:40.895
And that's where we came from?

38:40.896 --> 38:43.491
- Who told you...?
- How did you...?

38:43.515 --> 38:45.465
This guy at the library,
a writer.

38:45.466 --> 38:48.536
He's not one of us,
but he's tryin' to find the door...

38:48.537 --> 38:51.993
To Asgard.
He's convinced it's in East End.

38:52.517 --> 38:54.517
Great.

38:56.002 --> 39:00.008
Well, that door is locked.

39:01.040 --> 39:03.988
Forever.
No one's going in or out.

39:04.013 --> 39:08.314
There've always been mortals
trying to prove the myths are real.

39:09.870 --> 39:11.870
Don't even humor him.

39:11.895 --> 39:16.126
I'd just stay away from him
as much as possible, if I were you.

39:17.408 --> 39:19.408
Yeah, I will.

39:19.924 --> 39:21.484
(door opens)

39:21.727 --> 39:23.727
(door closes)

39:24.392 --> 39:26.141
- Hey.
- Hey, sweetheart...

39:26.142 --> 39:27.384
- Hey...
- Hey.

39:27.409 --> 39:30.821
So... Dash is back
