CHIAPAS
MEXICO - GUATEMALA BORDER

00:39.706 --> 00:42.375
If they ask why we're here,
what do we say?

00:42.459 --> 00:43.793
Leave that up to Toño.

00:54.262 --> 00:58.016
WANTED!
REWARD $5,000,000

01:18.078 --> 01:19.871
Good morning.

01:21.164 --> 01:23.374
IDs, please.

01:31.216 --> 01:32.717
Open your trunk.

01:58.159 --> 02:00.328
Jorge Ramos Pérez.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.581
Why are you going to Guatemala?

02:03.665 --> 02:05.750
To visit some friends in Barillas.

02:13.508 --> 02:15.093
Welcome.

02:15.176 --> 02:16.845
Thank you, officer.

02:28.523 --> 02:31.192
WELCOME TO THE REPUBLIC
OF GUATEMALA

02:49.627 --> 02:53.965
I feel the warmth
from my boiling blood

02:54.048 --> 02:58.303
I feel the fear,
sweat dripping away

02:58.386 --> 03:02.640
There's a stillness
that nothing transmits

03:02.724 --> 03:08.479
I'm a breeze that grows stronger

03:09.814 --> 03:13.693
Even when the clouds drift away

03:13.776 --> 03:17.739
Even when my skin dries away

03:17.822 --> 03:21.826
I'll be back someday

03:22.827 --> 03:26.873
To unleash my return

03:30.877 --> 03:35.506
I have the dust that protects the road

03:35.590 --> 03:39.886
I have the branches of a leafless tree

03:39.969 --> 03:44.307
I'm the guardian of the tired night

03:44.390 --> 03:50.063
There are silhouettes that come to meet me

03:51.064 --> 03:54.651
Even when the clouds drift away

03:55.443 --> 03:58.696
Even when my skin dries away

03:59.530 --> 04:03.701
I'll be back someday

04:03.785 --> 04:08.665
To unleash my return

04:40.905 --> 04:43.116
Relax. Come on, drink one.

04:53.251 --> 04:54.877
They're here, boss.

05:01.759 --> 05:02.969
Bring me the check!

05:49.807 --> 05:52.643
GUATEMALA CITY
GUATEMALA

05:56.105 --> 05:57.940
Hello.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.025
Toño.

05:59.108 --> 06:01.986
The man of the hour.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.613
Be careful.

06:03.696 --> 06:05.907
I don't want my fans
to recognize me.

06:10.369 --> 06:11.746
How's Guatemala treating you?

06:12.705 --> 06:14.415
Let's see how it treats us.

06:40.399 --> 06:43.736
HERRERÍAS' HOUSE
GUATEMALA CITY

06:51.536 --> 06:53.079
Up there.

06:56.457 --> 06:57.750
That's Herrerías.

07:06.801 --> 07:09.095
Your organization
is the strongest around here.

07:09.178 --> 07:11.305
And this will be
my new operation center.

07:11.389 --> 07:12.849
I want to be your partner.

07:12.932 --> 07:14.809
HERRERÍAS
DRUG LORD IN GUATEMALA

07:14.892 --> 07:17.520
They warned me that
you're really full of yourself.

07:17.603 --> 07:20.022
You're fucked, Chapo.

07:20.731 --> 07:23.943
You should be asking
to be my employee, not my partner.

07:27.822 --> 07:30.908
WANTED, JOAQUÍN GUZMÁN LOERA
REWARD $5,000,000

07:36.456 --> 07:38.124
Takes so little to scare you?

07:38.207 --> 07:40.960
Don't try to convince me, Chapo.

07:41.043 --> 07:44.213
You're up shit creek
and you have nothing left to offer.

07:46.340 --> 07:48.342
I have five tons of blow in El Salvador.

07:49.510 --> 07:51.721
40% of the profit is yours.

07:52.555 --> 07:54.682
That's over $40 million.

07:56.350 --> 07:58.561
It's a good amount to start
our partnership, right?

07:59.770 --> 08:01.355
That's if you manage to bring it in.

08:03.149 --> 08:04.567
It'll come in.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.492
Seeing is believing.

08:15.119 --> 08:18.080
I need you to gather me
some people in El Salvador.

08:18.164 --> 08:20.500
-When do you need them?
-For tomorrow.

08:21.417 --> 08:23.044
I need a big group.

08:23.127 --> 08:25.588
But I don't want to draw
attention at the border.

08:44.857 --> 08:47.109
We have to smuggle that shipment
no matter what, Toño.

08:47.193 --> 08:49.195
The business with the Colombians
is at stake.

08:49.278 --> 08:52.073
Amado must already know.

08:52.156 --> 08:54.242
I'm sure they are waiting
for us to kill us.

08:54.325 --> 08:55.576
We have no choice.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.079
Either they kill us
or we kill them.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.187
I'm finally visiting another country.

09:25.398 --> 09:27.692
I'll show you the whole damn world.

09:47.086 --> 09:49.297
How many of them were there?

09:49.380 --> 09:51.090
There were three Mexicans.

09:51.173 --> 09:53.134
Two men and a young woman.

09:53.217 --> 09:54.635
They drank some beers,

09:54.719 --> 09:58.139
and then they left with some people
who seemed from the military.

09:58.222 --> 10:00.391
Did they mention
where they were heading?

10:01.934 --> 10:03.019
No.

10:04.020 --> 10:05.229
Did you hear any names?

10:07.732 --> 10:10.067
One of the men called
the other one "boss".

10:14.614 --> 10:16.532
Any other details
that come to mind?

10:17.742 --> 10:19.327
-No.
-Look, Commander.

10:22.413 --> 10:24.290
It has a hidden compartment.

10:38.846 --> 10:40.514
-Please, go ahead.
-Thank you.

10:46.937 --> 10:50.941
We've got intel that El Chapo managed
to cross the border to Guatemala.

10:53.194 --> 10:56.864
He has to pick up five tons
of cocaine in El Salvador.

10:56.947 --> 11:01.619
That would be the biggest seizure
made by the DEA in Central America.

11:10.419 --> 11:13.214
They are aware
that we need your help.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.299
They are helping too.

11:16.133 --> 11:17.760
We've only asked them to wait

11:17.843 --> 11:19.678
until Chapo arrives
to get his shipment...

11:21.180 --> 11:22.681
and to turn him in eventually.

11:55.214 --> 11:58.008
MEXICO CITY
PRIVATE HANGAR

12:18.571 --> 12:21.407
MEXICO CITY

12:22.324 --> 12:26.245
OFFICE OF THE MEXICAN ATTORNEY-GENERAL

12:42.803 --> 12:45.514
FILE

12:59.278 --> 13:03.032
I didn't think you'd have the balls
to get me this information.

13:03.115 --> 13:05.242
I've risked everything
on my part of this.

13:06.368 --> 13:07.995
Now, it's your turn.

14:22.611 --> 14:25.656
The men I sent will be on watch 24/7.

14:25.739 --> 14:27.032
I need another favor.

14:29.743 --> 14:32.162
I'm bringing my operations
center over here.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.792
But before that, I need
to finish something in El Salvador.

14:38.043 --> 14:39.587
We're here to help.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.191
This is a bombshell, Saavedra.

15:03.235 --> 15:04.612
Is your source trustworthy?

15:04.695 --> 15:05.946
Yes.

15:06.030 --> 15:08.282
I only need a witness's testimony.

15:08.365 --> 15:09.658
Find one and we can move on.

15:10.951 --> 15:13.621
What about the board?
What will the board say at the meeting?

15:13.704 --> 15:15.623
Leave them to me.

15:15.706 --> 15:19.126
You find the witness,
and I'll get you the authorization.

15:46.362 --> 15:48.322
-Mrs. Magnolia?
-Yes?

15:48.405 --> 15:51.283
Nice to meet you. Gabriela Saavedra,
from the El Global newspaper.

15:51.367 --> 15:54.286
Some years ago,
Ms. Márquez filed a complaint.

15:54.370 --> 15:56.372
I only want to ask her some questions.

15:56.455 --> 15:58.165
I'm sorry.
She doesn't live here anymore.

15:58.248 --> 16:00.709
I'm carrying out an investigation
on General Blanco.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.294
-I think--
-No.

16:02.378 --> 16:04.338
-I would like to... Only---
-No, I'm not interested.

16:04.421 --> 16:05.923
-If only you--
-I'm not interested.

16:25.150 --> 16:27.152
CHIAPAS
BORDER OF MEXICO-GUATEMALA

16:28.445 --> 16:29.571
Like it?

16:30.197 --> 16:31.907
It's beautiful.

16:34.910 --> 16:36.954
I'll buy you a bigger one later.

16:37.788 --> 16:39.623
Once I finish that business
in El Salvador,

16:39.707 --> 16:41.875
you'll know how it feels
to live like a queen.

16:41.959 --> 16:43.002
Hmm.

16:46.922 --> 16:48.549
We're ready, boss.

16:50.259 --> 16:51.427
Be careful.

16:54.304 --> 16:55.472
Take this.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.391
Make this house nice.

17:05.733 --> 17:08.777
Chapo, Rosado is asking
for more money.

17:08.861 --> 17:10.070
He's never satisfied.

17:10.154 --> 17:12.656
The price on your head
is tempting for anyone.

17:12.740 --> 17:14.450
Protecting you is expensive.

17:17.578 --> 17:18.912
Give him what he's asking for.

17:24.585 --> 17:25.586
Good luck.

19:19.616 --> 19:21.869
-What do you think, Toño?
-It's safe.

19:23.453 --> 19:24.830
It may work.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.584
How long does it take
to get to the border?

19:29.126 --> 19:30.794
About 40 minutes.

19:53.817 --> 19:55.777
Do you know if he already got
to El Salvador?

19:55.861 --> 19:57.613
No, boss.

19:57.696 --> 20:00.073
But we have people at the border.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.034
They'll let us know
as soon as he sets foot in there.

20:06.538 --> 20:08.165
If they find him...

20:09.208 --> 20:10.834
tell them to kill him.

20:12.419 --> 20:14.087
And then they can let us know.

20:22.596 --> 20:23.597
BORDER CHECKPOINT
GUATEMALA -EL SALVADOR

20:23.680 --> 20:24.973
IDs, please.

20:27.935 --> 20:30.270
I'm going to check your trunk.

20:48.455 --> 20:50.123
Why are you going to El Salvador?

20:50.207 --> 20:52.542
To visit some friends in Barillas.

20:52.626 --> 20:54.461
You may continue.
Welcome to El Salvador.

21:15.983 --> 21:19.736
PORT LA LIBERTAD
EL SALVADOR

21:51.184 --> 21:52.894
Welcome to El Salvador.

22:28.430 --> 22:30.098
Thank you for coming.

22:30.182 --> 22:32.601
Did you get what you needed?

22:32.684 --> 22:34.394
I have all the pieces
to start building the puzzle.

22:34.478 --> 22:35.479
Great.

22:35.562 --> 22:36.563
See you soon.

22:36.646 --> 22:40.484
You are really brave
for wanting to relive the past.

22:40.567 --> 22:43.653
I was brave when I reported him
to the district attorney's office.

22:43.737 --> 22:47.532
But just as he'd warned me,
it was useless.

22:50.368 --> 22:52.537
Your story will be invaluable.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.707
If I may, I'll record this.

22:58.543 --> 23:00.545
I'm not afraid of him anymore.

23:01.963 --> 23:04.716
At that time I was afraid.
I was only 18 years old.

23:05.425 --> 23:08.386
He threatened me to kill
my family if I spoke.

23:08.470 --> 23:11.098
Thank God, I had
the support of my family.

23:11.181 --> 23:14.059
I gave them the description,
everything they needed,

23:14.142 --> 23:15.936
but nothing happened.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.523
That bastard never paid
for what he did.

23:55.142 --> 23:56.852
I have the men Rosado asked for.

23:56.935 --> 23:59.062
The shipment is protected.

23:59.146 --> 24:02.399
I need to know how many people
are keeping watch.

24:03.567 --> 24:05.235
This is the address.

24:05.318 --> 24:07.946
And this is what we've agreed
to pay you.

24:21.001 --> 24:24.504
SAN LORENZO NEIGHBORHOOD
SAN SALVADOR, EL SALVADOR

24:58.705 --> 25:01.625
CHAPO'S WAREHOUSE
SAN LORENZO NEIGHBORHOOD

25:02.125 --> 25:03.627
Do you know him?

25:07.464 --> 25:10.383
Yes, he lives in the neighborhood.

25:19.059 --> 25:21.186
I'll go fetch some empanadas.
Do you want some?

25:24.689 --> 25:26.441
We call it ají here.

25:49.839 --> 25:51.549
We'll take the blow from here.

25:52.550 --> 25:54.427
We'll take it to Cuba...

25:55.679 --> 25:57.597
and then directly to Miami.

25:59.766 --> 26:02.185
We have to make this route
something big, Toño.

26:09.985 --> 26:12.487
Do you think we'll go back
to Mexico some day?

26:39.848 --> 26:42.225
Do you want some sauce with that?

26:42.309 --> 26:45.186
No, the gringos
cannot eat spicy food.

26:45.270 --> 26:47.022
I'll just put tomatoes, then.

26:56.865 --> 26:59.576
-How many are there?
-He just said they were gringos.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.289
Tell me, kid,
what did they buy?

27:04.372 --> 27:07.083
Empanadas, no chili.

27:07.167 --> 27:08.877
How many with no chili?

27:08.960 --> 27:10.420
Eh... five.

27:19.304 --> 27:21.848
The situation
is worst than we thought.

27:21.931 --> 27:25.185
The DEA is watching your shipment.

27:25.268 --> 27:27.270
Are you 100% sure?

27:28.480 --> 27:30.982
Yes, sir, there are at least five.

27:32.067 --> 27:35.278
And I checked
with my contact in Customs.

27:35.362 --> 27:36.946
They entered through Mexico.

27:37.030 --> 27:38.531
Damn it.

27:38.615 --> 27:40.617
What do you want to do, boss?

27:42.369 --> 27:43.620
Get your men ready.

27:46.164 --> 27:47.457
I'm sorry, what?

27:47.540 --> 27:49.125
Let's get the shipment.

27:50.502 --> 27:51.669
But sir...

27:53.254 --> 27:55.048
We can't go against the DEA.

27:55.507 --> 27:56.508
You'll do as I say!

27:56.591 --> 27:59.302
That's why I'm paying you,
son of a bitch! Eh?

28:05.141 --> 28:06.184
Get out of here.

28:08.269 --> 28:09.396
We'll call you later.

28:13.525 --> 28:16.152
I know we need that shipment,

28:16.236 --> 28:18.113
but we can't mess
with the DEA.

28:18.196 --> 28:20.407
Remember what happened
to Quintero and Neto

28:20.490 --> 28:22.325
over the Kiki Camarena issue.

28:22.409 --> 28:24.452
There's always a way, Toño.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.288
Nobody believed in my tunnel,
but there's always a way out.

28:38.383 --> 28:40.760
Stop! Come on! Come on!

28:52.647 --> 28:54.315
Secure the area!

29:19.424 --> 29:20.925
It will be published tomorrow.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.572
Thank you for coming.

29:43.823 --> 29:45.575
I wanted to say goodbye personally.

29:46.326 --> 29:47.619
Say goodbye?

29:47.702 --> 29:49.788
I'm leaving Mexico
as soon as possible.

29:50.497 --> 29:53.458
Once your article appears
in tomorrow's newspaper,

29:53.541 --> 29:55.502
General Blanco won't stop
until finding out

29:55.585 --> 29:57.003
who leaked that information.

29:57.879 --> 29:59.881
I won't say a word,
you can rest assured.

29:59.964 --> 30:01.841
I don't betray my sources.

30:01.925 --> 30:03.343
I know that.

30:03.426 --> 30:05.303
And I'm really thankful.

30:07.847 --> 30:10.517
I'd like to ask you
for a personal favor before leaving.

30:10.600 --> 30:11.893
Mm-hmm?

30:12.977 --> 30:15.230
Can you give me a copy of your article?

30:16.564 --> 30:19.776
I'm afraid I won't have access
to your newspaper after I'm gone.

30:19.859 --> 30:21.569
And I wouldn't like to miss
the chance to feel

30:21.653 --> 30:24.697
the pleasure of reading the article
that will finish the General.

30:29.452 --> 30:31.162
Yes, sir.

30:36.292 --> 30:37.877
I'll tell the boss.

30:59.274 --> 31:01.359
This is all I could get for you.

31:12.245 --> 31:14.497
I gave Lora all the instructions.

31:17.834 --> 31:20.378
We'll have to give Herrerías
all the money we have

31:20.461 --> 31:22.088
so we can work for him.

31:23.256 --> 31:25.258
It'd mean going back to square one,
but if he takes us in,

31:25.341 --> 31:27.135
we'll be protected
by his organization.

31:30.013 --> 31:33.683
If you want to go back to Mexico,
you're free to do so.

31:34.517 --> 31:36.436
I'll always have your back.

31:36.519 --> 31:39.397
You managed to be at the top over there,
and you'll do the same here.

31:40.106 --> 31:41.774
Well, then...

31:41.858 --> 31:43.735
Let's find another way
to cross the border,

31:43.818 --> 31:45.153
even if we have to become moles.

31:46.696 --> 31:48.865
And I won't get into that trunk again.

31:49.490 --> 31:50.617
Not even for 30 minutes.

31:51.159 --> 31:52.493
Come on, let's go.

32:14.557 --> 32:15.934
GUATEMALA CITY
GUATEMALA

32:16.017 --> 32:18.019
When do you want to meet Herrerías?

32:19.437 --> 32:20.939
As soon as possible.

32:21.022 --> 32:23.983
Things didn't go
as planned in El Salvador.

32:39.832 --> 32:41.501
They should have arrived already.

32:46.214 --> 32:47.632
Finally.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.304
What happened with the meeting?

32:53.388 --> 32:54.597
It's settled.

32:54.681 --> 32:57.475
Rosado and Herrerías will wait
for you in the Panamericano Hotel.

33:08.528 --> 33:10.113
Boss.

33:13.950 --> 33:15.535
Thanks for everything, Lora.

33:16.411 --> 33:18.830
I'm sorry I have to go,
but I need to go back to Mexico.

33:18.913 --> 33:20.206
Call me if you need anything.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.556
We have 1.5 million.

33:53.865 --> 33:54.949
What's with all the security?

33:55.033 --> 33:56.034
PANAMERICANO HOTEL
GUATEMALA CITY

33:56.117 --> 33:57.952
You don't trust Herrerías?

33:58.036 --> 33:59.996
Herrerías is like that
when he leaves his house.

34:00.079 --> 34:02.123
He demands extra security.

34:03.833 --> 34:05.376
Go ahead.

34:23.895 --> 34:25.021
Where's Herrerías?

34:26.981 --> 34:28.191
He's not coming.

34:29.817 --> 34:32.987
Let's do this the right way, Chapo.
I don't want you to get hurt.

34:33.988 --> 34:36.574
It's a shame that your business
in El Salvador didn't work, but...

34:36.657 --> 34:38.951
this is your new reality.

34:39.035 --> 34:42.538
The price for your head
is an opportunity we cannot miss.

34:44.332 --> 34:46.584
If this is about money,
let's talk about it.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.545
I can be more generous
than the government.

34:50.171 --> 34:52.048
If you let me go,
I'll give you 1.5 million.

34:53.883 --> 34:55.551
500,000 more than the reward.

34:56.594 --> 34:58.846
With that money you can retire.

35:42.223 --> 35:43.724
Hey! Hey!

35:51.983 --> 35:53.818
You fucking traitor!
Son of a--!

36:24.640 --> 36:26.559
I need to speak
with the President.

36:27.185 --> 36:29.103
From Lieutenant Rosado.

36:32.273 --> 36:34.275
Good evening, Mr. President.

36:34.358 --> 36:37.069
I'd like to inform you
that we've captured El Chapo Guzmán.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.455
Thank you very much, Mr. President.

36:47.538 --> 36:49.332
We won't forget
how helpful you were.

36:51.000 --> 36:53.586
General Blanco will coordinate
the operation.

36:53.669 --> 36:56.172
I don't want any information
leaked to the press.

36:56.255 --> 36:59.884
I want the news to be out tomorrow,
once I'm at the border with him.

36:59.967 --> 37:01.469
All right, General.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.815
Amado.

37:17.193 --> 37:18.903
El Chapo was detained in Guatemala.

37:33.751 --> 37:35.544
GENERAL BLANCO, THE PRESIDENT'S
RIGHT HAND AND UNPUNISHED CRIMINAL

37:35.628 --> 37:37.421
What's this?

37:38.256 --> 37:40.758
I found it by chance.

37:40.841 --> 37:43.886
My contact informs me
that it will be published tomorrow.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.973
We have some time to stop it.

37:50.893 --> 37:54.730
Lucía, please, telephone the owner
of the El Global newspaper.

37:54.814 --> 37:56.357
Of course, sir.

37:56.857 --> 37:58.067
Good job, Conrado.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.861
You deserve a promotion.

38:05.324 --> 38:08.035
Peralta, what's going on
in your newspaper?

38:08.119 --> 38:10.371
I've just read an article
by Gabriela Saavedra.

38:10.454 --> 38:11.664
What's that all about?

38:13.249 --> 38:15.543
It's not important how I found out.

38:15.626 --> 38:17.753
What's important here
is the content of that article.

38:17.837 --> 38:19.547
It's unacceptable.

38:54.373 --> 38:55.958
Good morning.

39:56.727 --> 39:58.479
MILITARY HEADQUARTERS
GUATEMALA -MEXICO BORDER

40:08.155 --> 40:09.990
Put those two in that truck.

40:10.908 --> 40:13.077
El Chapo goes in my truck.

40:27.425 --> 40:28.884
Let's go!

41:10.676 --> 41:12.428
Rayito.

41:12.511 --> 41:14.638
-What's up, buddy?
-A toast to this great fucking life!

41:19.059 --> 41:21.479
Here you are, Güero, take it.
This is pure power.

41:21.562 --> 41:24.023
This is freedom, Güero! Look!

41:24.106 --> 41:25.232
This is great!

41:30.112 --> 41:31.238
Keep playing, my friends!

41:31.322 --> 41:32.364
Keep playing, man!

41:41.582 --> 41:43.125
This is the real power.

41:44.710 --> 41:45.961
This is freedom!

41:48.672 --> 41:49.673
