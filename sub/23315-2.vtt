WEBVTT

00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.267
Oi, oi! We're back!

00:13.833 --> 00:16.767
Get me back in that house.
Aah!

00:16.833 --> 00:18.867
Stand by. Geordies incoming.

00:21.367 --> 00:23.133
Oh. My. God.

00:25.767 --> 00:28.467
I'm so excited,
I ca-ca-poo-poo'd in me
knickers.

00:36.267 --> 00:39.233
What's the three things
that Geordies are good at?

00:39.300 --> 00:40.933
Bucking...

00:41.000 --> 00:42.767
necking...

00:42.833 --> 00:44.233
...and drinking.

00:46.467 --> 00:48.667
Toon, we are coming for ya.

00:52.267 --> 00:53.867
Shit's about to go down.

00:55.033 --> 00:56.467
This is mint.

00:57.367 --> 00:58.733
(cheering)

01:00.967 --> 01:04.933
We're back, and two newbies
have joined our fucked up
family.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.767
Hello.
(screams)

01:06.833 --> 01:08.800
Hi!
(all exclaim)

01:08.867 --> 01:11.400
But we lost one of our
originals.

01:11.467 --> 01:13.700
Gaz won't be coming back at all.

01:13.767 --> 01:16.000
Fuck's sake, man.
I can't believe that.

01:16.067 --> 01:19.433
This new girl's arrived,
it's unnecessary drama.

01:19.500 --> 01:21.333
Steph, why d'you wanna see
Aaron?

01:21.400 --> 01:23.967
I just feel like we've got
unfinished business.

01:24.033 --> 01:26.600
This is awkward,
especially in front of Marnie.

01:26.667 --> 01:30.067
Chloe got straight in there
with new boy, Sam.

01:30.133 --> 01:33.200
I like Sam a lot more
than what I liked Marty. Gee!

01:37.367 --> 01:41.267
Two single girls, one single
boy,
is a recipe for disaster.

01:44.233 --> 01:46.600
I'm a natural beauty,
real boobs, real hair.

01:46.667 --> 01:49.800
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

01:49.867 --> 01:52.633
I'm tanned, toned
and ready to tash on.

01:52.700 --> 01:54.467
I'm preened to perfection.

01:54.533 --> 01:56.867
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:56.933 --> 01:59.600
I'm cheeky, colourful
and full of mischief.

01:59.667 --> 02:02.367
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

02:02.433 --> 02:05.500
I might be entirely bonkers,
but all the best people are.

02:06.467 --> 02:08.532
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:20.067 --> 02:22.233
Morning.
(Abbie) Morning.

02:22.300 --> 02:25.000
I've woke up this morning
in such a good mood.

02:25.067 --> 02:28.433
Me and Sam got on so well last
night
and I do really like him.

02:28.500 --> 02:30.467
I was watching you and Sam
last night.

02:30.533 --> 02:33.833
Me and Sophie seen him go like
that
with your tit and rubbing it.

02:33.900 --> 02:38.400
Oh, my God. You were looking at
the ceiling, staring at the
stars.

02:38.467 --> 02:40.600
You were going...
(laughs)

02:40.667 --> 02:43.133
I can't believe that Sam
was rubbing me boobies

02:43.200 --> 02:44.733
and I was dead in the face.

02:44.800 --> 02:47.900
I must have been fucking mortal.
What else happened?

02:47.967 --> 02:50.067
You shag him?
No!

02:50.133 --> 02:53.600
I feel so awkward, cos he was
flirting with me last night as
well.

02:53.667 --> 02:55.567
So do you fancy him as well?

02:55.633 --> 02:58.800
It's still early days, isn't it?
You never know.

03:02.433 --> 03:04.300
Me mind is vague from last
night.

03:04.367 --> 03:08.167
I'm not fucking surprised. You
were
absolutely fucked in there.

03:08.233 --> 03:11.433
I remember that Chloe was in
the room last night, in Sam's
bed.

03:11.500 --> 03:13.700
All I want to know is
did anything happen?

03:13.767 --> 03:16.000
Did you shag her?
No, cos she come in...

03:16.067 --> 03:19.633
But you did something though,
didn't you? Cos I heard noises,
Sam.

03:19.700 --> 03:22.100
Should I tell them
or should I be a gent?

03:22.167 --> 03:25.600
I might have slipped a finger.
She touched your willy, didn't
she?

03:25.667 --> 03:27.133
I think so, yeah.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.600
So now, basically,
you're hers, right?

03:29.667 --> 03:31.800
In her head.
Yeah, in her head.

03:31.867 --> 03:34.233
I've already got to know Chloe
quite well,

03:34.300 --> 03:37.200
but something's telling me
to get to know Abbie as well

03:37.267 --> 03:39.033
because she's a great girl, too.

03:39.100 --> 03:41.667
Yesterday, when we were
teasing you about Steph,

03:41.733 --> 03:45.933
we said, "If you were single,
would you go there?"

03:46.000 --> 03:48.933
If I was single,
then I probably would shag
Steph,

03:49.000 --> 03:52.533
but there would be World War
Three
in this house with Marnie.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.400
It wouldn't be worth the hassle.

03:54.467 --> 03:59.033
I would, but it could cause
a lot of problems. (all laugh)

03:59.100 --> 04:01.700
It's a good job that Marnie's
in a relationship.

04:01.767 --> 04:03.933
When she's not,
she's a fucking psycho.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.233
Out of ten?
9.5.

04:06.300 --> 04:08.233
(all laugh)

04:13.433 --> 04:16.700
Do you know where humans come
from?
From monkeys.

04:16.767 --> 04:19.867
Nah, apparently... fish.

04:19.933 --> 04:23.000
(laughs)
Sam, I feel like you're very
stupid.

04:23.067 --> 04:27.300
Sam is thick as fuck. And that's
why
he's fitting in so well.

04:27.367 --> 04:30.200
We're not alone. I mean,
if you think about it, right,

04:30.267 --> 04:33.900
there's more stars in the
universe
than there's grains of sand.

04:36.800 --> 04:39.033
We're all on the sofa,
talking about space,

04:39.100 --> 04:41.767
and in comes Uranus.

04:41.833 --> 04:43.867
Oh, no, just wait a second.
It's Anna.

04:43.933 --> 04:46.100
Can you gather round the sofas,
please?

04:46.167 --> 04:49.433
I am fucking praying that
she doesn't send me to work
today.

04:49.500 --> 04:50.867
Welcome back.

04:50.933 --> 04:54.233
This is the first time I've seen
Anna
in a very long time,

04:54.300 --> 04:56.900
and that is not long enough.
What does she want?

04:56.967 --> 04:59.167
Sam, Steph.
Hello. Nice to meet you.

04:59.233 --> 05:02.000
How's everybody treating you?
Aye, we fit in well.

05:02.067 --> 05:04.200
Making you feel welcome?
Yeah. Yeah.

05:04.267 --> 05:06.700
Good. So I've decided...

05:11.033 --> 05:13.133
...I'm not sending yous
to work today.

05:13.200 --> 05:14.733
(cheering)
Oh, my God.

05:14.800 --> 05:17.800
I can't believe that Anna
is not sending everyone to work.

05:17.867 --> 05:19.900
She is 100 percent getting
shagged.

05:19.967 --> 05:23.700
I'll be back in touch soon
about work. Be good.

05:23.767 --> 05:25.533
(Nathan) We will!
OK.

05:25.600 --> 05:28.400
(Sophie) Thanks, Anna.
Bye.

05:30.733 --> 05:33.533
Thank God that none of us
are going to work today.

05:33.600 --> 05:36.533
I want to get to know
these two newbies better.

05:36.600 --> 05:39.567
And I am starving,
so I'm gonna take Steph and Sam
out

05:39.633 --> 05:42.300
to pick up
some fresh Geordie stotties.

05:42.367 --> 05:43.667
Come on!

05:43.733 --> 05:47.200
I'm so glad to be getting out of
this house with Sophie and Sam.

05:47.267 --> 05:49.633
I feel like I'm part
of this wicked family.

05:49.700 --> 05:51.567
Do this!
Let's do this shit, man!

05:53.267 --> 05:54.833
I've got a good idea.
Go on.

05:54.900 --> 05:57.933
What goes in a butty?
Eggs! Chips!

05:58.000 --> 06:00.333
So I'm gonna go get some chips.
I'm coming.

06:00.400 --> 06:03.733
Aaron, that was a bit eager.
Nearly jumped down her throat
then.

06:03.800 --> 06:05.300
I'm gonna go and get ready.

06:05.367 --> 06:08.933
Marnie and Aaron might flirt
over the battered sausage.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.033
I hope they don't eat it,
cos I want it.

06:11.100 --> 06:13.500
Go get ready for the chippy
date!
Fuck off.

06:13.567 --> 06:16.000
If me and Marnie sit together,
we're flirting,

06:16.067 --> 06:19.267
and if we go to the chippy,
it's a date. I can't fucking
win.

06:19.333 --> 06:21.400
Oh, fuck's sake.
Stuck on the door?

06:21.467 --> 06:23.567
Whilst we're waiting
for the stotties,

06:23.633 --> 06:26.800
I want to question Chloe and
Abbie
what's going on with Sam.

06:26.867 --> 06:29.833
I don't want their friendship
turning sour over a boy.

06:29.900 --> 06:31.933
Last night
you were a bit head-strong.

06:32.000 --> 06:33.733
Did anything happen?
Why?

06:33.800 --> 06:36.633
Sam got his fingers, like,
a little bit wet. What?

06:36.700 --> 06:39.133
He put them in your fanny.
When? Last night.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.900
(sighs)

06:41.000 --> 06:42.933
No, he didn't.
I think he did.

06:43.000 --> 06:44.833
Oh, my God, that is so
embarrassing.

06:44.900 --> 06:48.000
I am gutted about this,
but if Chloe can't even
remember,

06:48.067 --> 06:50.433
she can't be that much into Sam,
can she?

06:50.500 --> 06:52.167
Until she tells me otherwise,

06:52.233 --> 06:54.633
as far as I'm concerned,
he's still fair game.

06:54.700 --> 06:58.800
I hope you don't catch the
feelings.
No, cos I didn't know it
happened.

06:58.867 --> 07:01.567
I know me and Sam
got a little bit freaky last
night,

07:01.633 --> 07:04.333
but I don't even remember
him putting his finger in.

07:04.400 --> 07:06.767
I don't know if I shaved my
fanny.

07:08.500 --> 07:09.567
(exhales)

07:14.233 --> 07:15.733
Hello!
Hiya, mate.

07:15.800 --> 07:19.133
There's nothing better
than freshly baked stotties,

07:19.200 --> 07:21.833
and Norman is letting us
make our own.

07:21.900 --> 07:23.100
I love Norman.

07:23.167 --> 07:25.167
You need to get the dough
on the table.

07:25.233 --> 07:27.067
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

07:27.133 --> 07:30.767
This dough feels fucking mint.
I'm gonna put my face in it.

07:30.833 --> 07:32.167
Right in the middle.

07:32.233 --> 07:34.200
Go on, right in! Ugh!

07:34.267 --> 07:36.167
Look, the teeth and everything!

07:36.233 --> 07:39.000
I think we better get on with
it.
Do they not take long?

07:39.067 --> 07:40.700
15 minutes.
Top or the bottom?

07:40.767 --> 07:42.933
Bottom.
Can you keep your eye on the
oven?

07:43.000 --> 07:45.033
You've been a great help.
Thank you.

07:45.100 --> 07:47.467
Sam and Chloe got really close
last night,

07:47.533 --> 07:50.433
so I think now is the perfect
time
to quiz him on it.

07:50.500 --> 07:53.433
What was going on?
What has went on? I need the
goss.

07:53.500 --> 07:56.700
It got a little bit heated
last night. Did you get a hard
on?

07:56.767 --> 07:58.867
Yeah, and she grabbed it.
Did you?

07:58.933 --> 08:02.133
What happened?
I might have slipped a finger...

08:02.200 --> 08:06.900
When I asked Chloe what
happened, she
said, "Nothing. Just a little
kiss."

08:06.967 --> 08:10.033
So either Sam's lying
or Chloe's lying.

08:10.100 --> 08:13.200
So, are you gonna try
and slip the finger in Abbie?

08:14.133 --> 08:15.500
It's hard to say, like.

08:15.567 --> 08:18.033
I already know how this one's
gonna play out.

08:18.100 --> 08:21.767
Chloe's gonna end up catching
the
feelings and end up getting
hurt.

08:21.833 --> 08:23.733
This spells disaster.

08:23.800 --> 08:25.600
Me and Chloe are getting on
better.

08:25.667 --> 08:28.200
In a week,
she might hate me, I might hate
her.

08:28.267 --> 08:31.400
I don't want to upset anybody
by getting to know Abbie, too,

08:31.467 --> 08:34.267
but there's something about her
that intrigues me.

08:34.332 --> 08:36.633
I've never been
in this situation before.

08:36.700 --> 08:38.832
Shall we get the stotties
out the oven?

08:38.900 --> 08:41.167
We are ready!
Ohh! Let's gerr'em oot!

08:47.000 --> 08:50.933
Keep these chips
for the butties as well. Hi!

08:51.000 --> 08:54.367
People get the wrong impression
because we've slept together.

08:54.433 --> 08:57.800
But I can honestly say that
me and Aaron are better as
friends.

08:57.867 --> 09:00.100
We never, ever got on
as good as we do now.

09:00.167 --> 09:03.800
Even if we ended up in bed
together,
I know that nothing would
happen.

09:03.867 --> 09:06.667
Yeah, no, no, no. I feel like
we've both grown up a lot.

09:06.733 --> 09:10.133
I don't think we'd do it to
ourself
and we wouldn't do it to...

09:10.200 --> 09:12.600
It's been a long time
since that's happened.

09:12.667 --> 09:15.167
Everyone knows
that I absolutely adore Marnie

09:15.233 --> 09:17.100
and all I want
is for her to be happy,

09:17.167 --> 09:18.833
cos if she's happy, I'm happy.

09:18.900 --> 09:22.933
We'll have fun. And this whole
Steph
situation just be put to bed,
yeah.

09:23.000 --> 09:24.667
I'm gonna be totally honest.

09:24.733 --> 09:27.300
If me and Marnie were both
single
in this house

09:27.367 --> 09:31.300
then we'd probably give it
another
go because we get on so well.

09:31.367 --> 09:33.633
Bye!
Bye.

09:35.433 --> 09:37.267
Let's go and eat this shit.

09:39.467 --> 09:43.400
I was wondering, your fanny
hair,
do they have, like, dead ends?

09:43.467 --> 09:47.667
You've got to keep it clean.
You've got to shampoo,
conditioner.

09:47.733 --> 09:49.667
I don't condition my pubes.

09:49.733 --> 09:52.000
Hello you!
Hello!

09:52.067 --> 09:53.700
Where's Marnie and Aaron?

09:53.767 --> 09:59.167
They've gone to get some chips
to
go with these! Oi! There they
are!

09:59.233 --> 10:01.867
Thank fuck
someone has thought about food.

10:01.933 --> 10:04.833
Nothing better than
a homemade stottie and some
chips.

10:04.900 --> 10:07.933
Shall we go and get ready
for our night out? (all) Yeah.

10:08.000 --> 10:09.200
I wanna still eat.

10:12.900 --> 10:14.700
Yes! Shit shirt night tonight!

10:15.833 --> 10:18.267
I am the plant woman! (screams)

10:18.333 --> 10:20.500
Tonight I will not end up
in Marnie's bed.

10:22.567 --> 10:24.433
I'm absolutely sick of this
shit.

10:24.500 --> 10:27.233
Abbie and Sam
can fucking have each other.

10:27.300 --> 10:29.800
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

10:31.967 --> 10:32.167
.

10:34.733 --> 10:34.933
.

10:47.200 --> 10:50.067
Just to clarify,
it looks like my nanna's
wallpaper.

10:50.133 --> 10:52.400
We've decided tonight
is shit shirt night.

10:52.467 --> 10:54.633
By the looks of it,
Nathan's already won.

10:54.700 --> 10:57.667
You've got yours off to a T.
Nathan's is the shittest.

10:57.733 --> 11:00.033
Whoa! Are you fucking kidding
me?

11:00.100 --> 11:02.867
Yours looks like a fucking
barcode!
(laughs)

11:02.933 --> 11:07.367
I'm not gonna lie, my shit shirt
is not actually that shit.

11:07.433 --> 11:09.367
I look fucking mint.

11:09.433 --> 11:10.967
Give me fucking shit!

11:11.033 --> 11:14.600
You look like you work
at a Chinese restaurant.
(laughs)

11:14.667 --> 11:16.133
You fucking daft cunt.

11:16.200 --> 11:19.500
You take my order and you can
fucking scan it! (all laugh)

11:21.100 --> 11:23.133
I wanna ask you something.
OK.

11:23.200 --> 11:26.633
Sam said that he fingered you.
But you didn't tell me that.

11:26.700 --> 11:28.867
What the hell?
She kept that one quiet!

11:28.933 --> 11:32.667
I didn't remember. How do you
not
know if a finger's in your
vagina?

11:32.733 --> 11:36.700
The thing I do every night, get
pissed and never remember what I
do.

11:36.767 --> 11:38.367
Either Chloe's really dumb,

11:38.433 --> 11:41.467
or she's downplaying what
happened
in front of Abbie.

11:41.533 --> 11:43.367
Because Abbie does not look
happy.

11:43.433 --> 11:46.567
Yous need to do something
tonight
and make him aware

11:46.633 --> 11:48.800
that yous aren't fighting over
him.

11:48.867 --> 11:52.400
I think the best thing for me
and
Chloe to do is to both back off
Sam.

11:52.467 --> 11:54.967
But I don't think Chloe
will stick to it.

11:55.033 --> 11:58.400
What'd you do if he then
went to you? I'd say "Fuck off!"

11:58.467 --> 12:01.833
I don't want to stay away from
Sam
tonight, because I do like him.

12:01.900 --> 12:04.533
But for the sake of Abbie,
I'm gonna try my hardest.

12:04.600 --> 12:07.100
But it is gonna be proper hard.
Girls!

12:07.167 --> 12:09.633
Me and the boys are downstairs,
looking good.

12:09.700 --> 12:13.633
Need to get the girls down,
have a quick cheers... (all)
Cheers!

12:13.700 --> 12:15.467
...and get the fuck into town.

12:15.533 --> 12:18.167
Come on, it's a party!

12:18.233 --> 12:20.367
Woo-hoo!
Let the girls have the big one.

12:20.433 --> 12:21.467
Party posse!

12:30.433 --> 12:33.433
We've arrived at Koo's
and the place is bouncing.

12:33.500 --> 12:35.267
Tonight is gonna go off.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.200
(all) Cheers!

12:48.533 --> 12:50.167
Fucking hell!

12:55.033 --> 12:57.300
We've been in the club
for two seconds

12:57.367 --> 12:59.400
and Chloe has already
went over to Sam.

12:59.467 --> 13:02.200
I thought you were sticking
to the plan, Chloe.

13:05.533 --> 13:08.500
I know I said to Abbie
I would stay away from Sam
tonight,

13:08.567 --> 13:11.533
but I need to ask him
why he's blabbed to Nathan

13:11.600 --> 13:12.867
about fingering us.

13:15.133 --> 13:16.900
(laughs)

13:16.967 --> 13:20.233
Everyone's telling me that
Chloe gets attached dead easily.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.200
But me and her
are not exclusive yet.

13:32.800 --> 13:35.367
I've told Chloe that
I want to get to know Abbie.

13:35.433 --> 13:38.467
She said, "Do whatever you
want."
Better than expected.

13:42.767 --> 13:45.067
Whoa, I just played it so cool.

13:45.133 --> 13:49.200
I am a strong, independent
woman.
(farts)

13:53.200 --> 13:55.867
I can't believe how well Steph
is fitting in.

13:55.933 --> 13:58.767
It's like her and Sam
have been in this family
forever.

14:14.133 --> 14:16.367
Chloe has said this in the past,

14:16.433 --> 14:19.033
and when she said it
she's fallen for the boy.

14:19.100 --> 14:21.600
So as far as I'm concerned,
Sam is fucked.

14:28.633 --> 14:30.733
Cheers, and let's fucking have
it.

14:38.233 --> 14:40.333
Sam, what are you doing?

14:40.400 --> 14:43.933
Walking straight over to Abbie
is playing with fire.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.267
What about Chloe?

14:58.800 --> 15:02.200
I don't want this to wreck
mine and Chloe's friendship.

15:02.267 --> 15:05.867
But Sam's flirting and I'm not
gonna lie, I like the attention.

15:12.800 --> 15:16.533
Normally it's me grafting the
girls,
not them grafting me.

15:16.600 --> 15:19.533
This is quite new, but d'you
know what, I fucking love it.

15:24.400 --> 15:26.633
Sam is giving us
all the right signals,

15:26.700 --> 15:29.500
so it's making it so much
more easier to flirt back.

15:29.567 --> 15:31.100
(laughs)

15:43.800 --> 15:47.533
Marnie's getting wasted tonight
and I want to check she's OK.

15:47.600 --> 15:49.933
I feel like she's got
a lot on her mind.

16:02.300 --> 16:05.300
Me and Aaron are both
in relationships and we're
happy,

16:05.367 --> 16:08.067
but that doesn't mean
I want to meet his girlfriend

16:08.133 --> 16:10.033
because that would be fucking
weird.

16:12.300 --> 16:13.567
Marnie may be drunk,

16:13.633 --> 16:17.167
but she's dealing with Aaron
being in a relationship really
well.

16:17.233 --> 16:19.533
I hope that he's dealing with it
just as good.

16:32.333 --> 16:34.000
I don't know if I believe Aaron.

16:34.067 --> 16:36.233
There's always gonna be
something there

16:36.300 --> 16:39.767
when it comes to him and Marnie.
I think he's trying to kid
hisself.

16:54.700 --> 16:57.833
I feel like my flirting skills
are on fire tonight.

16:57.900 --> 17:01.233
I just keep going and going
and I don't know when I'll stop.

17:06.700 --> 17:10.133
Abbie says she's gonna stay away
from Sam but she's all over him.

17:10.200 --> 17:11.367
That is too much.

17:19.567 --> 17:23.133
I'm staying away from Sam,
but I just think it's so
embarrassing

17:23.200 --> 17:27.133
how Abbie is still trying, when
she knows I have been in his
bed.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.633
And he's even fingered us.

17:35.167 --> 17:38.400
If Sam does pull Abbie
and necks on with her naturally,

17:38.467 --> 17:41.367
I will not go there.
cos that is so muggy.

18:02.633 --> 18:06.067
I don't want Chloe to worry
about
Sam and get hurt in the process.

18:06.133 --> 18:08.967
So tonight I want to make sure
she's always smiling,

18:09.033 --> 18:12.067
and I know the best way to do
that.
My dance moves.

18:18.433 --> 18:22.567
I am fucking mortal and all I
want
to do is grab Chloe for a dance.

18:34.133 --> 18:36.800
Everyone is mortal.
Marn can barely see straight.

18:36.867 --> 18:39.300
Let's get back and line wuh
stomachs.

18:44.067 --> 18:45.400
(cheering)

18:48.767 --> 18:50.867
Fancy seeing you here.
Hello, you.

18:50.933 --> 18:52.967
Oi, oi, princess!

18:53.033 --> 18:55.133
(all speaking indistinctly)

18:56.333 --> 18:59.433
Kebab, kebab, I fucking love
kebab.

19:02.033 --> 19:04.567
Marnie. Marns.

19:04.633 --> 19:06.267
I am fucking mortal.

19:06.333 --> 19:10.533
How do I even managed
to get myself in this state?

19:10.600 --> 19:13.233
I think it's only right
that I check on Marnie.

19:13.300 --> 19:16.700
I'm gonna rub her back
and make her feel better,

19:16.767 --> 19:18.667
cos that's what best friends do.

19:25.533 --> 19:28.867
Shall we go in the hot tub?
I'm gonna go and get changed.

19:28.933 --> 19:32.000
I've got a perfect swimming
costume
to show off to Sam.

19:32.067 --> 19:33.367
I can't fucking wait.

19:33.433 --> 19:35.000
Show me your bum.

19:36.400 --> 19:37.833
That's fucking huge.

19:37.900 --> 19:40.567
It's time to get in the hot tub
with Chloe and Abbie.

19:40.633 --> 19:41.800
This is fucking mint.

19:41.867 --> 19:44.800
Come on! Time to party!

19:44.867 --> 19:46.500
Come on, yous.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.667
Hello! Come on!

19:49.733 --> 19:51.800
I'm coming!

19:51.867 --> 19:53.733
(indistinct)

19:53.800 --> 19:55.833
Oh, my God, it's fucking
freezing!

19:55.900 --> 19:59.533
This is just our luck.
The hot tub is fucking broken.

19:59.600 --> 20:00.667
Go in the shower.

20:00.733 --> 20:03.933
If the hot tub isn't working,
we can always go in the shower.

20:04.000 --> 20:07.300
They're both wet,
they're both hot and steamy.
Result!

20:07.367 --> 20:12.867
Listen. While you peasants
shower,
the queen will have a bath.

20:12.933 --> 20:15.367
How about we play dares?

20:15.433 --> 20:17.667
Yes! I think we should spice it
up.

20:17.733 --> 20:21.633
I want to see if Chloe's playing
it
"cool" act with Sam is the
truth.

20:21.700 --> 20:25.533
Right, I dare Abbie to get with
Sam.
Oh!

20:25.600 --> 20:28.267
When I meant spice it up,
I meant with me and Sam.

20:28.333 --> 20:29.867
Not Sam and fucking Abbie!

20:29.933 --> 20:31.867
I want to see pure sex.

20:31.933 --> 20:33.767
I want you to give me a semi on.

20:35.533 --> 20:37.533
Abbie and Sam are necking on

20:37.600 --> 20:41.067
and I can see in Chloe's face
she's not happy about it.

20:42.567 --> 20:45.967
I swear to God...
Don't put it in!

20:46.033 --> 20:47.767
No, don't! I don't want it...

20:47.833 --> 20:50.233
Ahh! No!

20:50.300 --> 20:54.200
I feel like swinging Abbie
around
like I'm swinging this plant
around.

20:54.267 --> 20:57.467
Her necking on with Sam
has really fucked us off.

20:58.767 --> 21:03.233
Chloe, I think we know how you
feel
about Sam and Abbie necking on
now.

21:03.300 --> 21:06.000
(laughter)

21:10.967 --> 21:13.700
(laughter)

21:13.767 --> 21:16.633
This has turned into
absolute carnage.

21:18.800 --> 21:21.433
Who knew a little bit of soil
would save my night?

21:21.500 --> 21:24.867
Abbie and Sam are no longer
necking on. Get the fuck in.

21:24.933 --> 21:29.400
Don't mess with me, bitch,
cos I am the plant woman!

21:29.467 --> 21:31.800
I am the plant woman!

21:31.867 --> 21:33.733
This family is fucking rad.

21:50.633 --> 21:52.967
(cheering)
Goal!

21:53.033 --> 21:55.333
I'll have Abbie.
Are you taking the piss?

21:55.400 --> 21:59.000
This is bringing back
horrible memories. What the
fuck?

21:59.067 --> 22:01.633
Holy fucking mother of
all fucking fucks.

22:01.700 --> 22:04.100
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

22:06.467 --> 22:06.667
.

22:09.167 --> 22:09.367
.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.433
How are yous feeling?

22:24.500 --> 22:27.467
Bet you got a fright when you
woke up and Aaron was there.

22:27.533 --> 22:29.933
I did cos I was so drunk. I was
ill.

22:30.000 --> 22:32.000
You didn't do anything wrong.

22:32.067 --> 22:34.200
Marnie doesn't need
to have beer fear.

22:34.267 --> 22:36.800
Last night I seen Aaron
lying on her bed.

22:36.867 --> 22:38.833
There was nothing under the
covers

22:38.900 --> 22:42.067
and he was lying there
as if he was in a coffin.

22:42.133 --> 22:44.667
It's just frustrating
cos you have a boyfriend

22:44.733 --> 22:47.733
who doesn't understand
cos he's not in here.

22:47.800 --> 22:50.900
I was so ill
and Aaron was just looking after
us.

22:50.967 --> 22:54.267
If anything, my boyfriend
should be happy that someone
cares.

22:55.667 --> 22:57.900
You necked on with Sam.
Yeah.

22:57.967 --> 23:00.600
It was a full-on porno
when I looked to me right.

23:00.667 --> 23:02.933
Was it? It was a passionate one?

23:03.000 --> 23:05.867
The shower was on and
everything.
They were like that.

23:05.933 --> 23:07.800
I was like, what's going on?

23:07.867 --> 23:11.100
I had to neck on with him,
so we just necked on.

23:11.167 --> 23:13.333
I loved my kiss in the shower
with Sam,

23:13.400 --> 23:16.267
but I can't tell the girls
how I honestly feel about it

23:16.333 --> 23:18.867
cos I don't think Chloe
would want to hear it.

23:18.933 --> 23:21.333
What was the kiss like?
You were in the shower

23:21.400 --> 23:25.700
and the water's dripping on you,
was it like a... I don't know.

23:25.767 --> 23:29.433
Abbie is really playing down
that
kiss. I saw it with my own eyes

23:29.500 --> 23:32.433
and I know that girl
was loving every minute of it.

23:32.500 --> 23:34.600
Well, I'm not gonna say
I didn't like it.

23:34.667 --> 23:36.767
Chloe has been really quiet

23:36.833 --> 23:39.700
and I think it's because of the
way
she feels about Sam.

23:39.767 --> 23:42.433
I just hope that she's not
gonna get hurt again.

23:46.300 --> 23:49.833
Sam, do you remember last night
in the bathroom, you got with
Abbie?

23:49.900 --> 23:51.700
I don't know what to say about
that.

23:51.767 --> 23:55.700
Last night's kiss was really
steamy.
I'm not gonna lie, I quite liked
it.

23:55.767 --> 23:58.600
I'm getting to know everybody
else
a little bit more.

23:58.667 --> 24:00.500
With your mouth?
With my mouth.

24:00.567 --> 24:03.167
Right now,
Sam has the best of both worlds.

24:03.233 --> 24:06.000
He can flirt with Chloe
and still crack on with Abbie.

24:06.067 --> 24:08.200
And I can see this taking a bad
turn.

24:08.267 --> 24:10.367
Who would you rather buck?
I don't know.

24:10.433 --> 24:13.867
Sam is sitting on the fence and
you can't fucking shag the
fence.

24:13.933 --> 24:16.100
Abbie or Chloe,
it's a simple choice.

24:16.167 --> 24:19.100
Honestly, I do not know
cos I like both of the girls.

24:19.167 --> 24:23.033
And I don't know when you got in
that bed cos you weren't in
there.

24:23.100 --> 24:26.667
Nice one, Sam. Dodging the
question
and then putting it back on me.

24:26.733 --> 24:29.967
Yes, I woke up in Marnie's bed
and yes, I fucking shit myself.

24:30.033 --> 24:32.333
I stayed there
because she were being sick.

24:32.400 --> 24:35.900
Aaron, I was sick the night
before
and you weren't there nursing me

24:35.967 --> 24:37.933
or rubbing my back. That's
bullshit.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.233
Who wants coffee?
Me, please, I need one.

24:40.300 --> 24:42.667
Go on, mate, I'll have one as
well.

24:42.733 --> 24:46.233
If my ex was in here, I would
never
have got in bed with them.

24:46.300 --> 24:49.967
It is harmless, but at the same
time, they're in bed together.

24:50.033 --> 24:52.600
Them two have the most history
and chemistry,

24:52.667 --> 24:55.100
and it's undeniable
when we're on a night out.

24:55.167 --> 24:57.300
If Aaron and Marnie
get drunk together,

24:57.367 --> 24:59.433
it's got disaster
written all over it.

24:59.500 --> 25:03.167
They can't control their
emotions,
boyfriend or girlfriend or not.

25:10.300 --> 25:13.167
I just don't know if I've got
any words, if I'm honest.

25:13.233 --> 25:17.000
What the hell?
Who has trashed the bathroom?

25:17.067 --> 25:18.567
So, who was it?

25:18.633 --> 25:22.200
I feel really bad, but I'm gonna
let Chloe take the blame for
this.

25:22.267 --> 25:24.633
It was all Chloe.
Was it you?

25:24.700 --> 25:26.633
No, it wasn't me.
You had a plant pot.

25:26.700 --> 25:28.633
Me and Aaron know Chloe
down to a tee,

25:28.700 --> 25:31.667
and the fact that she's trying
to lie is making it worse.

25:31.733 --> 25:34.033
How do you find the defendant?
Guilty.

25:34.100 --> 25:35.733
Very guilty!

25:35.800 --> 25:39.333
Chloe, you are sentenced
to clean that bathroom.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.567
Am I fuck!
You are, spick and span.

25:41.633 --> 25:44.967
I do feel bad for Chloe,
but I want to put as much
distance

25:45.033 --> 25:47.533
between me and that bathroom
as possible,

25:47.600 --> 25:49.333
so I've come up with a good
idea.

25:49.400 --> 25:53.467
Why don't we go and play beer
google
football? That'd be so fun!

25:53.533 --> 25:55.500
Chloe needs to learn her lesson,

25:55.567 --> 25:58.400
so she needs to stay behind
and clean the bathroom.

25:58.467 --> 26:00.467
Clean the soil, you dirty bitch.

26:00.533 --> 26:02.500
Chloe's crying.
I'm really upset.

26:02.567 --> 26:05.767
You're gonna be a gardener
for the day. Alan Tits-marsh.

26:05.833 --> 26:07.700
I don't like any of yous.

26:07.767 --> 26:11.133
I didn't know a bit of soil
could cause this much damage.

26:11.200 --> 26:13.967
Now Sam and Abbie
get to hang out all day.

26:14.033 --> 26:16.967
Let's go get ready for football.
Don't pick me last.

26:17.033 --> 26:20.333
You can't pick me last,
that's just fucking torture.

26:24.067 --> 26:26.733
Bye-bye, Chloe. Bye.
Enjoy cleaning!

26:31.033 --> 26:32.267
(gasps)

26:34.200 --> 26:37.133
Holy fucking mother of
all fucking fucks.

26:38.133 --> 26:39.533
What the fuck?

26:39.600 --> 26:43.000
There is no way I can clean
this bathroom by myself.

26:43.067 --> 26:45.933
I need someone to help
and I know the perfect person.

26:46.000 --> 26:47.500
Hi, Mam.

26:47.567 --> 26:49.567
Help us clean up.
I'll give you 50 quid.

26:49.633 --> 26:51.667
I'll even rub your feet.

26:52.633 --> 26:55.067
Yes! Thank God for that.

27:01.700 --> 27:03.200
(all) Hiya.

27:03.267 --> 27:06.300
All right, guys? I'm Keith
and I'll be running the game.

27:06.367 --> 27:08.267
Any volunteers for team
captains?

27:08.333 --> 27:10.733
Obviously,
I'm gonna be captain at
football.

27:10.800 --> 27:13.100
In this house, I'm the fucking
best.

27:13.167 --> 27:16.133
Don't necessarily pick
the Ronaldo of the group.

27:16.200 --> 27:19.533
There's no Ronaldo here, I can
tell you that. I'll have Steph.

27:19.600 --> 27:22.133
Aaron's gone first
and he's picked Steph.

27:22.200 --> 27:25.133
And now it's Sam's turn,
I know it's gonna be me.

27:25.200 --> 27:26.833
I'll have Abbie.

27:26.900 --> 27:29.667
Are you taking the fucking piss?

27:29.733 --> 27:31.967
I'll have Marnie.
Nah! Nah!

27:32.033 --> 27:34.367
I'll have Sophie.
(laughter)

27:34.433 --> 27:37.500
This is bringing back
horrible memories.

27:37.567 --> 27:40.200
I know exactly why
I was picked last in school

27:40.267 --> 27:43.700
and I know why I'm picked last
today.
Cos I can't kick a ball.

27:43.767 --> 27:45.967
I'm not playing.
I didn't want Nathan.

27:46.033 --> 27:48.167
The last person to be picked
is Nathan,

27:48.233 --> 27:51.733
and I don't even want him on my
team
because he's that shit.

27:51.800 --> 27:55.400
We're gonna rock, paper,
scissors.
For who doesn't want you.

27:55.467 --> 27:57.400
Cool.
(both) One, two, three, four.

27:57.467 --> 28:00.400
(both) One, two, three, four.
Oh, my...

28:00.467 --> 28:02.333
(both) One, two, three, four.
Yes!

28:02.400 --> 28:05.467
I didn't want you.
You're on Sam's team. (laughter)

28:05.533 --> 28:08.267
Nathan, you go in goal.
(laughter)

28:08.333 --> 28:11.600
Are they for real?
They're meant to be my friends.

28:11.667 --> 28:14.300
Fuck yous!
Why did I even bother coming?

28:15.267 --> 28:18.233
Put them on. Watch me brows!
(laughs)

28:18.300 --> 28:21.467
It's nice to be able to talk to
Sam
when no one else is around.

28:21.533 --> 28:24.067
Chloe staying at home
has worked in my favour.

28:24.133 --> 28:26.900
I looked at your body
and it looks like you work out.

28:26.967 --> 28:28.967
I must have been looking
at your arse.

28:29.033 --> 28:30.333
Were you?
I think so.

28:30.400 --> 28:34.633
Sam is being really flirty
and he's even been checking us
out.

28:34.700 --> 28:37.233
And that makes me feel like
this.

28:37.300 --> 28:39.600
I've got to say,
that kiss last night...

28:39.667 --> 28:41.400
I don't know what came over me.

28:41.467 --> 28:44.267
I wasn't totally honest
with the girls this morning.

28:44.333 --> 28:47.300
My kiss with Sam was a lot
more passionate than I let on.

28:47.367 --> 28:49.500
Fucking hell, it's getting a
bit...

28:49.567 --> 28:51.133
Steamy.
Steamy, yeah.

28:51.200 --> 28:53.167
Did you enjoy it?
Was I a good kisser?

28:53.233 --> 28:56.467
It was better than last time.
Why don't we make it a hat
trick?

28:56.533 --> 28:58.067
What's a hat trick?
Three.

28:58.133 --> 29:02.233
Sam wants to neck on with me
again
and make it some kind of hat
trick.

29:02.300 --> 29:04.333
I guess that means that I've
scored.

29:04.400 --> 29:05.600
(whistle blows)

29:05.667 --> 29:08.333
(all shouting)
Oh! Ah! I've hurt my leg
already.

29:08.400 --> 29:09.800
Sam, you can do it.

29:09.867 --> 29:11.833
Oh, he's done it!

29:11.900 --> 29:14.833
Goal! Yes!

29:14.900 --> 29:16.567
Get in there, my son.

29:16.633 --> 29:18.800
(whistle blows, laughter)

29:20.667 --> 29:22.300
(cheering)

29:22.367 --> 29:26.767
I don't know how, but I have
managed to score the winning
goal.

29:26.833 --> 29:28.333
This feels amazing.

29:28.400 --> 29:32.500
Yes!

29:32.567 --> 29:34.767
Losers, losers, losers!

29:34.833 --> 29:37.833
It's not about who wins,
it's about taking part!

29:37.900 --> 29:39.867
You didn't take part in
anything.

29:47.900 --> 29:49.400
(laughs)

29:49.467 --> 29:52.600
(gasps) Barbara!

29:52.667 --> 29:54.533
Oh, my God!

29:54.600 --> 29:57.333
My mam has come with Barbara.
This day is amazing.

29:57.400 --> 30:00.467
Now all I need her to do
is clean the fucking bathroom.

30:00.533 --> 30:02.967
Everyone blamed it on me
which it wasn't.

30:03.033 --> 30:05.767
Well, yeah, it was, but so what?
Uh-huh.

30:05.833 --> 30:08.367
And I have to stay and clean it
up.
What's that?

30:08.433 --> 30:11.500
Cheese. Want some?
No, thank you.

30:11.567 --> 30:15.400
I heard in science that cheese
mentally prepares the brain to
clean,

30:15.467 --> 30:17.167
so I'm having a block of cheese.

30:17.233 --> 30:20.767
My. God. Almighty.

30:20.833 --> 30:22.833
Go in.
I cannot even...

30:22.900 --> 30:25.433
That is absolutely....

30:25.500 --> 30:28.100
I've never seen anything like it
in me life.

30:28.167 --> 30:30.467
This was, what, a soil fight?

30:30.533 --> 30:33.767
Have you not had a soil fight
before?
Everyone does it.

30:33.833 --> 30:36.567
Soil fights are all the rage,
mam.
Jeez!

30:36.633 --> 30:39.600
I don't even know where to
start.
You get that one.

30:39.667 --> 30:43.767
Get it all in a pile, all
together
like what I'm doing there.

30:43.833 --> 30:46.667
You do realise this is gonna
take hours, don't you?

30:46.733 --> 30:50.467
Everyone knows that you always
get
the best advice from your mam.

30:50.533 --> 30:52.467
So I need to fill her in on Sam.

30:52.533 --> 30:55.400
We've been kissing.
But Abbie fancies him as well,

30:55.467 --> 30:58.433
so it's a little bit of a
competition
who he fancies most.

30:58.500 --> 31:02.033
He wants to get to know both of
wuh,
but I've kissed him more times.

31:02.100 --> 31:05.033
I do... I like him.
Uh-huh.

31:05.100 --> 31:06.767
We get on really well.

31:06.833 --> 31:08.867
He's funny, very funny.
Uh-huh.

31:08.933 --> 31:12.100
So I'm just keeping it cool,
staying back

31:12.167 --> 31:14.533
and, like, keeping a guard up,
like this.

31:14.600 --> 31:17.433
Good. Best way. That's the best
way.

31:17.500 --> 31:20.567
You don't want to be in
that situation again. No, I
know.

31:20.633 --> 31:23.667
Sounds like your type then,
doesn't he? Aye, he's my type.

31:23.733 --> 31:26.867
Well, let's get this done
cos I've got a party to go to.

31:26.933 --> 31:29.900
Talking to my mam has made me
realise that Sam is my type

31:29.967 --> 31:31.267
and I do really like him.

31:31.333 --> 31:34.233
As much as I'm playing it cool,
I'm starting to struggle

31:34.300 --> 31:37.933
cos I know what I'm like and I
am
definitely catching the
feelings.

31:41.633 --> 31:43.367
I thought it was hos before
bros.

31:48.400 --> 31:51.500
I find it really awkward.
I know I'm not in the wrong.

31:51.567 --> 31:53.933
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

31:55.933 --> 31:56.133
.

31:58.667 --> 31:58.867
.

32:12.233 --> 32:13.633
Chloe!
Chloe!

32:13.700 --> 32:15.033
I'm up here!

32:15.100 --> 32:18.767
Beer google football was really
good
but I am absolutely minging.

32:18.833 --> 32:22.500
I hope to God Chloe has cleaned
that bathroom so I can have a
bath.

32:22.567 --> 32:24.333
Right, Lady Muck.

32:24.400 --> 32:27.633
What is this? You've done
a very, very, very good job.

32:27.700 --> 32:30.767
Hats off to Chloe
because she has made this
bathroom

32:30.833 --> 32:33.667
look even cleaner
than what it was before.

32:33.733 --> 32:35.433
I don't believe she's done it.

32:35.500 --> 32:38.433
I swear on your life, I did all
this.
With no help?

32:38.500 --> 32:41.133
No help. Clean the bedroom,
it's waiting for you.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.033
You better pay for this shit.

32:43.100 --> 32:45.367
The downside of Chloe
staying in the house

32:45.433 --> 32:47.900
is that Sam has cracked on
at Abbie all day.

32:47.967 --> 32:50.500
I don't think Chloe's
gonna be best pleased.

32:50.567 --> 32:52.500
Are you jealous?
A little bit.

32:52.567 --> 32:55.367
I feel like it's a little bit
of a competition.

32:55.433 --> 32:57.733
This is starting to get
really frustrating

32:57.800 --> 32:59.400
cos I actually do like Sam

32:59.467 --> 33:01.933
and she's just doing it
for a competition.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.967
I do not win things.
You never know.

33:05.033 --> 33:07.567
The fact that Chloe's admitted
she's jealous

33:07.633 --> 33:09.233
shows how much she likes Sam.

33:09.300 --> 33:12.267
It's just a matter of time now
before she kicks off.

33:12.333 --> 33:15.300
What do you think come first,
the chicken or the egg?

33:17.167 --> 33:18.500
I don't have a clue.

33:18.567 --> 33:20.733
Wow, I do not want to see this.

33:20.800 --> 33:24.100
Abbie is supposed to be my pal
and she's all over fucking Sam.

33:24.167 --> 33:26.400
The egg.
What?

33:29.267 --> 33:33.767
Why am I feeling really guilty
right
now? This is getting really
awkward.

33:33.833 --> 33:35.067
The egg?
The egg.

33:35.133 --> 33:36.867
D'you think?
Mm.

33:40.467 --> 33:44.233
Yous, stop flirting!
Get upstairs and get ready! Come
on.

33:44.300 --> 33:47.000
Why?
Cos we're going out. Oh!

33:48.333 --> 33:51.267
After football today,
half my weave fell out.

33:51.333 --> 33:53.233
Look.
You've got a bald patch.

33:53.300 --> 33:57.300
I've always wanted to have
long, luscious, luxurious hair.

33:57.367 --> 34:00.333
And one game of fucking football
has ruined it.

34:00.400 --> 34:03.867
I don't think hair extensions
are
for you. I have to take it out
now.

34:17.033 --> 34:19.266
You were missed today,
I'm not gonna lie.

34:19.333 --> 34:23.533
I got to speak to me mam today
and
I told her about Sam. What'd she
say?

34:23.600 --> 34:26.467
She just said that I need
to keep my guard up and stuff

34:26.533 --> 34:29.567
cos she doesn't want us
to get hurt again. Good.

34:29.632 --> 34:33.433
Oh, my God. Chloe has been
talking to her mam about Sam.

34:33.500 --> 34:35.433
She hasn't spoken to me once.

34:35.500 --> 34:39.533
I think until she talks to me
then surely we can both go for
him.

34:39.600 --> 34:42.100
How the fuck did you speak
to your mam, by the way?

34:43.132 --> 34:45.900
Have you ever heard of a
telephone?
Yeah.

34:45.967 --> 34:48.800
Something doesn't add up.
That bathroom is spotless

34:48.867 --> 34:51.367
and she said she's been
on the phone to her mam.

34:51.433 --> 34:52.699
I don't believe her.

34:52.766 --> 34:56.600
Honestly, I've got no nails
left.
So what did you use to clean?

34:57.967 --> 35:00.233
Er, like toilet paper and that.
What?

35:00.300 --> 35:02.233
(indistinct)
A what?

35:02.300 --> 35:05.433
That thing, it's long
and it's got a weird end on it.

35:06.567 --> 35:09.400
Me mam puts it down the toilet
all the time. Bleach!

35:09.467 --> 35:11.167
Fucking bleach, that's it.

35:11.233 --> 35:13.667
You're lying.
It's cos I've got a bad chest.

35:13.733 --> 35:17.767
Your mam helped you, didn't she?
Scout's honour.

35:17.833 --> 35:20.700
Did you pay your mam, by the
way?
No, she paid me!

35:22.633 --> 35:25.167
Aaron,
where are you sleeping tonight?

35:25.233 --> 35:27.433
Last night,
Aaron slept in Marnie's bed.

35:27.500 --> 35:30.933
I think I'm more concerned
about his relationship than he
is.

35:31.000 --> 35:32.833
And that's dangerous.

35:32.900 --> 35:35.667
Fucking hell. Nathan's bed.
My bed? In my bed?

35:35.733 --> 35:38.200
Wherever I fucking fall.
(laughs)

35:38.267 --> 35:41.633
One thing's for sure, tonight
I will not end up in Marnie's
bed.

35:41.700 --> 35:43.200
I can guarantee you that.

35:43.267 --> 35:45.800
You've gone from Predator
to a pineapple head.

35:45.867 --> 35:48.200
One day I am gonna get
my own back on yous two

35:48.267 --> 35:50.267
and you're not gonna see it
coming.

35:50.333 --> 35:53.000
The two new family members
fit in perfectly.

35:53.067 --> 35:56.267
Sam has been the perfect lad
to have in the lads' bedroom.

35:56.333 --> 35:58.633
He's like a bright ball of fun.

35:58.700 --> 36:01.267
Nathan!
Nathan!

36:02.467 --> 36:05.233
(girls cheering)

36:05.300 --> 36:07.900
Whoa,
Nathan looks absolutely amazing.

36:07.967 --> 36:10.000
If he wasn't gay, I'd shag him.

36:10.067 --> 36:12.500
(Sophie) You sexy bastard!

36:12.567 --> 36:14.300
You are one...

36:14.367 --> 36:17.167
Wait there.
Oh.

36:17.233 --> 36:19.800
Oh, shit the bed.
(all talking)

36:19.867 --> 36:22.533
What do you think, ladies?
You look fit as fuck.

36:22.600 --> 36:24.833
The girls are giving me
so much attention.

36:24.900 --> 36:27.067
Why didn't I take my weave out
earlier on?

36:27.133 --> 36:30.233
We need to go out
cos I need to show this off.
Yes!

36:30.300 --> 36:31.833
(cheering)

36:31.900 --> 36:35.467
Party! Party! Party!
Partay, bitches!

36:41.400 --> 36:43.533
Chloe, you keeping away from
Sam?

36:43.600 --> 36:46.800
I'll still speak to him and
stuff,
so I'll see what happens.

36:46.867 --> 36:48.767
I can barely look at Abbie
tonight.

36:48.833 --> 36:52.033
The only thing I can think of
is her and Sam flirting all day.

36:52.100 --> 36:54.600
I need to keep me cool
but it's really hard.

36:54.667 --> 36:56.800
What about you, Abbie?

36:56.867 --> 36:59.100
Yeah, I mean,
I'm not gonna ignore him.

36:59.167 --> 37:02.367
I've got no reason to ignore
him.
It would just be rude.

37:02.433 --> 37:06.033
I can just cut the tension with
a knife between Chloe and Abbie.

37:06.100 --> 37:08.100
It's getting very frosty in
here.

37:08.167 --> 37:10.667
Well, let's have a good night,
girls.

37:18.467 --> 37:22.233
We are all gonna go
full steam ahead. Let's party!

37:30.800 --> 37:32.200
(cheering)

37:51.867 --> 37:55.833
On nights out, Aaron and Marnie
spend a lot of time together.

37:55.900 --> 37:58.967
And I know they're friends
but there's another six of us.

37:59.033 --> 38:00.467
Why don't you talk to us?

38:07.667 --> 38:11.133
Nathan, I loved the mop,
but you look fucking sexy now.

38:35.233 --> 38:39.467
Today has made me realise
how much I actually like Sam.

38:39.533 --> 38:41.267
But he spent the day with Abbie

38:41.333 --> 38:43.500
so I'm worried he likes her now
and not me.

38:43.567 --> 38:45.300
I hope I haven't fucked it up.

38:58.667 --> 39:00.167
I like Chloe and Abbie.

39:00.233 --> 39:03.367
I just want to continue
to keep getting to know them
both,

39:03.433 --> 39:06.133
but I feel like
I might be treading on thin ice.

39:07.467 --> 39:11.400
I can't believe Chloe is
flirting
with Sam right in front of my
face.

39:11.467 --> 39:13.867
Me and Sam
spent the whole day together,

39:13.933 --> 39:16.500
and now she's not letting him
out of her sight.

39:25.933 --> 39:28.967
Yes, I do fancy him
but I'm in a bit of a limbo.

39:29.033 --> 39:32.167
Do I try harder or step back
cos Chloe's my friend?

39:38.400 --> 39:40.400
Nathan hasn't told us to back
off,

39:40.467 --> 39:43.100
so I'm gonna carry on
and see where it goes.

40:02.367 --> 40:05.533
Everyone is fucking smashed,
especially me.

40:11.000 --> 40:14.000
Everyone's starting to see
that there's so much tension

40:14.067 --> 40:15.467
between Abbie and Chloe.

40:32.533 --> 40:34.300
I don't know what's got into
Abbie

40:34.367 --> 40:37.867
but she is definitely not the
girl
who I met a couple of months
ago.

40:37.933 --> 40:40.167
It's supposed to be hos before
bros.

40:43.700 --> 40:45.833
I don't know how much more
Chloe can take

40:45.900 --> 40:48.533
of this whole
Abbie and Sam situation,

40:48.600 --> 40:51.533
and everyone is so drunk,
it's time to go home.

40:51.600 --> 40:53.367
(laughter)

41:00.700 --> 41:02.067
I find it really awkward.

41:02.133 --> 41:04.900
The reason why I'm so angry
is cos me and Abbie

41:04.967 --> 41:07.033
are actually quite good friends,

41:07.100 --> 41:09.700
and if she kissed Sam first,
I wouldn't go there.

41:09.767 --> 41:11.467
And she still tried to do it.

41:11.533 --> 41:15.367
You've been saying that don't
know
if you like him or not. Yes, you
do.

41:15.433 --> 41:18.233
I'm gonna stay quiet
and hide behind this can of pop.

41:18.300 --> 41:21.167
I feel like you are taking this
as a competition. No.

41:21.233 --> 41:23.467
You said that skinny boys
are not your type.

41:23.533 --> 41:25.367
"I can't stand skinny boys."

41:25.433 --> 41:28.200
All of a sudden, Sam's come in,
that's your type.

41:28.267 --> 41:30.167
Chloe, what are you talking
about?

41:30.233 --> 41:33.267
Two girls can fancy the same
fucking lad. It's not a crime.

41:33.333 --> 41:34.833
That is my type.

41:34.900 --> 41:37.267
"That"?! Who the fuck's "that"?

41:37.333 --> 41:39.100
Like, he's got my banter.

41:39.167 --> 41:42.833
It's not a competition between
me and you. It's not with me.

41:42.900 --> 41:46.367
I'm not backing down in this
because I know I'm not in the
wrong.

41:46.433 --> 41:48.300
He's only been here not long.

41:48.367 --> 41:51.200
I've just said I like him
and I'm getting to know him.

41:51.267 --> 41:52.867
So what's wrong with that?

41:52.933 --> 41:56.167
Sam, you've gotta be straight up
here. What do you want to do?

41:56.233 --> 41:58.433
I don't know.
Do you not want any of them?

41:58.500 --> 42:00.200
Sam's just staying quiet.

42:00.267 --> 42:03.400
Fucking say something for
yourself,
you fucking pussy!

42:03.467 --> 42:08.067
But I feel like it's too early
days
to say, "I want you, I want
you."

42:08.133 --> 42:10.000
I'm absolutely sick of this
shit.

42:10.067 --> 42:12.433
Abbie and Sam
can fucking have each other.

42:12.500 --> 42:14.467
He obviously doesn't want to
pick.

42:14.533 --> 42:16.933
So I'm gonna let yous two crack
on,
I'm done.

42:17.000 --> 42:19.567
Fucking hell!
Why do I do this to myself?

42:21.400 --> 42:22.900
I'm gonna go to bed.

42:22.967 --> 42:26.767
I feel like that was my fault. I
should have took into
consideration

42:26.833 --> 42:28.667
that Abbie and Chloe are
friends.

42:28.733 --> 42:31.633
I'm going to bed.
Abbie, follow him! Abbie, shag
him!

42:31.700 --> 42:34.700
I'm going to sleep by myself
in the shag pad.

42:34.767 --> 42:36.200
Abbie, man!
Fuck off!

42:36.267 --> 42:37.967
Chloe was bang out of order.

42:38.033 --> 42:40.933
She never told me how she felt
about Sam until tonight.

42:41.000 --> 42:44.533
And now this has happened.
This is exactly what I didn't
want

42:44.600 --> 42:47.167
and I can't believe
it's actually come to this.

42:52.033 --> 42:53.533
(all) Happy birthday!

42:53.600 --> 42:56.033
It's my birthday
and today is all about me.

42:56.100 --> 42:59.333
I see ya!
Abbie's nanna is fucking
crackers!

43:00.900 --> 43:04.233
I'm gonna get Marnie
something special for her
birthday.

43:04.300 --> 43:05.900
My boyfriend's invited.

43:09.333 --> 43:12.500
Toon tours and its ambassadors
are going worldwide.

43:12.567 --> 43:14.600
(cheering)

43:14.667 --> 43:16.000
See you later, the Toon.

43:16.067 --> 43:18.733
I'm buzzing that we're going
to Tenerife.

43:21.767 --> 43:24.400
I've just lost the fucking plot.

43:24.467 --> 43:27.867
Aaron, you completely
overstepped the mark.

43:53.400 --> 43:53.600
.
