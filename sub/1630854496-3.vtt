00:12.929 --> 00:14.848
[serene music]

00:14.889 --> 00:16.850
[tapping]

00:16.891 --> 00:24.065
* *

00:28.862 --> 00:31.614
- * Honey came in,
and she caught me red-handed *

00:31.656 --> 00:35.076
* Creepin'
with the girl next door *

00:35.118 --> 00:37.537
- * Picture this,
we were both butt-naked *

00:37.579 --> 00:40.165
* Banging on
the bathroom floor *

00:40.206 --> 00:46.379
- * How could I forget that
I had given her an extra key? *

00:46.421 --> 00:50.133
- * All this time,
she was standing there *

00:50.175 --> 00:53.094
* She never took
her eyes off me *

00:53.136 --> 00:55.764
* *

00:55.805 --> 00:57.807
* But she caught me
on the counter *

00:57.849 --> 00:59.100
- * It wasn't me *

00:59.142 --> 01:00.769
- * Saw me banging
on the sofa *

01:00.810 --> 01:01.853
- * It wasn't me *

01:01.895 --> 01:03.772
- * I even had her
in the shower *

01:03.813 --> 01:05.106
- * It wasn't me *

01:05.148 --> 01:06.858
- * She even caught me
on camera *

01:06.900 --> 01:08.443
- * It wasn't me *

01:08.485 --> 01:10.195
- * She saw the marks
on my shoulder *

01:10.236 --> 01:11.571
- * It wasn't me *

01:11.613 --> 01:12.947
- * Hear the words
that I told her *

01:12.989 --> 01:14.282
- * It wasn't me *

01:14.324 --> 01:16.576
- * Heard her scream
getting louder *

01:16.618 --> 01:18.453
- * It wasn't me-- *
- [screams]

01:22.707 --> 01:24.626
[gasps]

01:24.668 --> 01:27.462
* *

01:27.504 --> 01:29.130
[grunts]

01:30.423 --> 01:32.258
It was you, Bumper.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.927
- [shudders]

01:33.968 --> 01:37.263
- You stole my song...

01:37.305 --> 01:40.141
and now you've stolen
my future.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.936
- Heidi.
- [grunts]

01:42.977 --> 01:45.063
[dramatic music]

01:45.105 --> 01:46.731
- Oh, my God.

01:46.773 --> 01:48.483
* *

01:48.525 --> 01:50.777
And now my hands are feet?

01:50.819 --> 01:53.071
[screaming]

01:53.113 --> 01:55.281
[screams, panting]

01:55.323 --> 01:57.367
- * Welcome *

01:57.409 --> 01:59.285
* In Berlin *

01:59.327 --> 02:01.413
* Dank--dank--dank-dank-dank *

02:01.454 --> 02:02.956
* Danke schÃ¶n *

02:02.997 --> 02:04.416
* Welcome *

02:04.457 --> 02:05.542
* In Berlin *

02:05.583 --> 02:08.962
* Dank--dank--dank-dank-dank *

02:09.004 --> 02:10.422
* Danke schÃ¶n *

02:10.463 --> 02:11.881
Oh, good, you're here.

02:11.923 --> 02:13.425
I've been trying
to reach you all night.

02:13.466 --> 02:16.803
I tried everything--
the phone...

02:16.845 --> 02:18.430
- Okay.

02:19.597 --> 02:21.599
- Look,
so I got here super early

02:21.641 --> 02:23.560
to try to get your usual order.

02:23.601 --> 02:25.687
But I don't speak German,
so I just pointed at things

02:25.729 --> 02:29.149
until they handed me this rag
for the milk steamer.

02:29.190 --> 02:31.109
Is this
what you normally order?

02:31.151 --> 02:33.862
Did I do good?
Can I feel better?

02:33.903 --> 02:34.821
- Ein latte, bitte.

02:34.863 --> 02:36.406
- Hey, you know what?
I'll pay.

02:36.448 --> 02:37.949
- Oh, no, no, no, that's okay.

02:37.991 --> 02:40.744
I wouldn't want to take
something that belonged to you.

02:40.785 --> 02:44.998
- Okay, so acts of service are
not your love language--noted.

02:45.040 --> 02:47.083
Look, I am so sorry.

02:47.125 --> 02:50.754
I just--I started singing
your song, and it was so good,

02:50.795 --> 02:52.505
and everyone said I needed to
impress Thea in order to have

02:52.547 --> 02:53.840
any hope of making it
to Unity Day,

02:53.882 --> 02:55.425
and it all
just happened so fast.

02:55.467 --> 02:58.303
- You know what? It's fine.
Let's just move on, okay?

02:58.345 --> 02:59.554
I can write another song.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.598
If you need that one so bad,
you can have it.

03:01.639 --> 03:04.517
- Okay, if I just listen
to the words you're saying

03:04.559 --> 03:07.395
and not the tone,
it seems pretty good.

03:07.437 --> 03:09.856
I think if you,
like, liked me again,

03:09.898 --> 03:11.983
that might be more fun
than being mad at me.

03:12.025 --> 03:13.943
'Cause are you having fun?
'Cause I'm not having fun.

03:13.985 --> 03:15.403
- Oh, I'm not mad.

03:15.445 --> 03:17.364
I am just disappointed
in a way that makes me feel

03:17.405 --> 03:18.615
like I should never believe

03:18.656 --> 03:20.200
anyone or anything ever again.
[door opens]

03:20.241 --> 03:22.285
- So two big pieces of news.

03:22.327 --> 03:23.703
First news, bad.

03:23.745 --> 03:25.080
The former love
of my life, Gisela,

03:25.121 --> 03:26.623
just tweeted out that
she's doing a big show

03:26.664 --> 03:28.249
in Friedrichshain tomorrow.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.376
If we don't stay competitive,

03:29.417 --> 03:31.044
she's gonna get
that newcomer spot.

03:31.086 --> 03:33.755
I admit that seeing my former
lover in the flesh recently

03:33.797 --> 03:36.716
has stirred up some feelings
for her in my own flesh.

03:36.758 --> 03:40.553
Ooh, to feel her skin
on my skin would...

03:40.595 --> 03:43.014
well, that would
be magic indeed.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.516
But that could never happen.

03:44.557 --> 03:46.226
"Sleeping with the Enemy"
is merely

03:46.267 --> 03:47.394
a 1991 Julia Roberts film,

03:47.435 --> 03:49.813
not a documentary
about my real life.

03:49.854 --> 03:53.149
But, anyway, moving on
to second news, which is good.

03:53.191 --> 03:56.069
There is a talk show that's
had a last-minute cancellation.

03:56.111 --> 03:57.821
- Wait, wait, don't tell me.
- I have to tell you.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.656
It's the whole point
of me talking right now.

03:59.698 --> 04:01.533
I sent a demo
to "Sour Pickles,"

04:01.574 --> 04:04.285
and they want to talk with you
at the taping today.

04:04.327 --> 04:05.578
- Yes!

04:05.620 --> 04:06.788
Wait, what's "Sour Pickles"?

04:06.830 --> 04:08.373
- It's an immensely
popular talk show

04:08.415 --> 04:11.459
that breaks new musicians while
they eat very sour pickles,

04:11.501 --> 04:13.753
and they are soaking up
the brine for your song.

04:13.795 --> 04:16.214
- They like the song that much?

04:16.256 --> 04:17.799
- The people in charge
of Unity Day

04:17.841 --> 04:20.427
are going to love seeing you
perform your original song

04:20.468 --> 04:21.469
on this popular show.

04:21.511 --> 04:23.596
They tend to follow the trends.

04:23.638 --> 04:25.432
Whew, this is such
a great opportunity

04:25.473 --> 04:27.600
to debut this Bumper banger.

04:27.642 --> 04:28.852
- Is that what
we're calling it?

04:28.893 --> 04:31.521
[laughs nervously]
I don't like that title.

04:31.563 --> 04:34.232
And you're sure
it's the song from last night?

04:34.274 --> 04:36.443
- Yes, t-the one you
wrote last night.

04:36.484 --> 04:37.944
Thea will back you up live.

04:37.986 --> 04:40.280
You'll answer a few questions
while eating pickles.

04:40.321 --> 04:42.782
I hope you have a sour tooth.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.617
- You know...

04:44.659 --> 04:46.703
I feel the more
I think about it,

04:46.745 --> 04:49.164
the more I think
that that song sucks.

04:49.205 --> 04:52.250
Mm-hmm. I mean,
it's a good song, but it sucks.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.752
- What?
The song is great.

04:53.793 --> 04:55.628
It's what got Thea on board.

04:55.670 --> 04:58.214
We love it, and soon all
of Germany will love it.

04:58.256 --> 05:01.426
They'll be playing it at
every charming Christmas market

05:01.468 --> 05:03.303
and completely free
day-care center

05:03.345 --> 05:04.721
all across this great land.

05:04.763 --> 05:08.058
Ah, don't second-guess
yourself.

05:08.099 --> 05:10.935
If this appearance goes well,
you're gonna be way ahead

05:10.977 --> 05:13.021
of Gisela
on the race for Unity Day.

05:13.063 --> 05:14.147
And if you get nervous,

05:14.189 --> 05:16.649
just talk about how much
you love Germany.

05:16.691 --> 05:19.361
And we'll all be there
together,

05:19.402 --> 05:22.906
because teamwork
makes the cream...

05:22.947 --> 05:24.199
"thirk."

05:24.240 --> 05:25.575
Like, it "thirkens" it up?

05:25.617 --> 05:27.077
Is this is the phrase?

05:27.118 --> 05:29.162
Oh, I bet it is.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.914
Eh, I'll Google it.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.584
- So that's--
Uh...

05:34.626 --> 05:37.462
[dramatic music]

05:37.504 --> 05:39.339
[sighs]

05:39.381 --> 05:42.092
* *

05:42.133 --> 05:43.802
- Listen, we are about
to perform together,

05:43.843 --> 05:45.011
and I want this to be good.

05:45.053 --> 05:46.513
So tell me
what is bothering you,

05:46.554 --> 05:47.931
so we can get it over with

05:47.972 --> 05:50.684
and never have to have
a personal conversation again.

05:50.725 --> 05:52.352
- It's nothing, nope.

05:52.394 --> 05:53.687
- You clearly want to talk.

05:53.728 --> 05:56.314
You're like a teen boy
who just saw "Fight Club."

05:56.356 --> 05:57.941
So out with it.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.359
- Okay, fine.

05:59.401 --> 06:01.361
Hypothetically,
I made a girl mad at me.

06:01.403 --> 06:03.446
Like, I stole her...

06:03.488 --> 06:05.532
staircase?

06:05.573 --> 06:07.409
I did a bad thing, all right?

06:07.450 --> 06:10.578
Which, fine, guilty as charged,
but then I apologized,

06:10.620 --> 06:12.539
which is the thing
you're supposed to do,

06:12.580 --> 06:13.873
and she's still upset--
it's not fair.

06:13.915 --> 06:15.750
- An apology
doesn't guarantee forgiveness.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.752
Sometimes people are just mad.

06:17.794 --> 06:19.879
I am mad every day
at the idea of spelling.

06:19.921 --> 06:22.924
How dare words tell me
what to do, right?

06:22.966 --> 06:24.300
Hi!
- Hello.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.760
- Um...

06:25.802 --> 06:29.097
Bumper Allen and DJ Das Boot
for "Sour Pickles."

06:29.139 --> 06:31.016
- Yeah, Miss Boot,
please go upstairs.

06:31.057 --> 06:32.058
- Thank you.

06:32.100 --> 06:34.060
- Every time
I messed up in the past,

06:34.102 --> 06:35.687
everyone was just like,

06:35.729 --> 06:37.397
"Oh, that's just
Bumper being Bumper,"

06:37.439 --> 06:39.441
and they forgave me
immediately.

06:39.482 --> 06:41.651
I never would take
out the trash.

06:41.693 --> 06:43.570
Bumper being Bumper.

06:43.611 --> 06:45.488
Put chili in the Keurig.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.198
That's just
Bumper being Bumper.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.408
Got the lawyer wet.

06:48.450 --> 06:51.119
Bumper being Bumper.

06:51.161 --> 06:54.581
I just wish everyone liked me
so I could feel good.

06:54.622 --> 06:56.291
- You're clearly not
going to stop talking

06:56.332 --> 06:58.752
until I pretend to care.

06:58.793 --> 07:01.171
It seems like
you're only interested

07:01.212 --> 07:03.965
in making yourself feel better.
- Mm-hmm.

07:04.007 --> 07:08.011
- For once, try thinking
about someone else's feelings.

07:08.053 --> 07:11.222
- Wow.
Me think about someone else?

07:11.264 --> 07:13.641
Okay, uh...

07:13.683 --> 07:16.102
the only other person
I can think of right now

07:16.144 --> 07:17.729
is Clarence Thomas?

07:17.771 --> 07:20.065
I don't even remember
who that is.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.233
- Bumper...

07:22.275 --> 07:23.860
just sing.

07:27.197 --> 07:29.366
- * One day
they'll know my name *

07:29.407 --> 07:31.993
[pop music playing]

07:32.035 --> 07:35.372
* One day
they'll know my name *

07:35.413 --> 07:37.248
* *

07:37.290 --> 07:40.418
* One day I'm gonna make it
out this room *

07:40.460 --> 07:43.213
* I don't have nothing
to lose *

07:43.254 --> 07:47.133
* I'll be patient
'cause I know it's on the way *

07:47.175 --> 07:49.969
* One day
they'll know my name *

07:50.011 --> 07:52.305
[cheers and applause]
- Wow.

07:52.347 --> 07:55.308
[cheers and applause continue]

07:55.350 --> 07:57.185
- Whoo!

07:57.227 --> 07:59.020
Yeah!

07:59.062 --> 08:00.438
- Thank you.

08:00.480 --> 08:03.441
[upbeat music]

08:03.483 --> 08:05.360
* *

08:05.402 --> 08:07.904
- Well, it's a beautiful song
you've written.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.198
- And it really
is for everybody.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.700
- Yes.
- Little kids,

08:11.741 --> 08:15.286
airline gate attendants,
scuba treasure hunters--

08:15.328 --> 08:16.830
everyone.

08:16.871 --> 08:18.915
- So let's now move on
to the interview.

08:18.957 --> 08:22.669
Bumper, you will eat
increasingly sour pickles

08:22.711 --> 08:24.713
while you answer questions.
- Okay.

08:24.754 --> 08:27.007
- So please take up
your first pickle.

08:27.048 --> 08:28.675
- [clears throat] Okay.
- Question number--

08:28.717 --> 08:31.845
- Before we get to munching,
I do have, um--

08:31.886 --> 08:33.221
This looks delicious.
Thank you.

08:33.263 --> 08:36.933
But, um, I do have one thing
that I'd like to say.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.354
I didn't actually write
that song.

08:41.396 --> 08:43.606
All the credit goes to Heidi...

08:43.648 --> 08:44.899
Fraren?

08:44.941 --> 08:47.736
- Wait, Heidi wrote that song?

08:47.777 --> 08:49.195
You're Heidi.

08:49.237 --> 08:51.239
- Yeah, I just, uh--

08:51.281 --> 08:53.992
I was just messing
around with something.

08:54.034 --> 08:56.494
- Well, that
is quite a revelation.

08:56.536 --> 08:58.496
- You did not write this song?

08:58.538 --> 08:59.706
Pickle number two.

08:59.748 --> 09:01.124
- Moving on quick, okay.

09:01.166 --> 09:02.709
- But your manager,
Pieter Kramer,

09:02.751 --> 09:04.878
told us that you conjured it
out of thin air.

09:04.919 --> 09:08.590
Pickle me this, did famous
liar Pieter Kramer lie again?

09:08.631 --> 09:09.716
- Oh, no.
- No.

09:09.758 --> 09:10.842
- Oh, my God.
- Absolutely not.

09:10.884 --> 09:11.926
- No.
- No, this is my fault.

09:11.968 --> 09:15.388
See, we--
- So you misinformed Pieter,

09:15.430 --> 09:16.723
and he never lied?

09:16.765 --> 09:17.974
Pickle number three.

09:18.016 --> 09:21.186
- Uh, yeah, well,
I wouldn't say--

09:21.227 --> 09:23.063
[chokes, shudders]

09:23.104 --> 09:25.065
This one's got
a little pep to it.

09:25.106 --> 09:26.733
I wouldn't say
that he never lied.

09:26.775 --> 09:28.068
I mean, he lies,

09:28.109 --> 09:29.652
'cause he lied to get me
to move to Germany, but--

09:29.694 --> 09:30.820
Oh, my God.

09:30.862 --> 09:32.530
- What is he doing?

09:32.572 --> 09:33.990
- Well, you have heard it
here first.

09:34.032 --> 09:37.243
Disgraced mouth-musician-
turned-mouth-manager

09:37.285 --> 09:38.870
Pieter Kramer lies again.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.081
- No, no, okay, let's, let's--

09:41.122 --> 09:43.541
Oh, yeah, this is really sour.

09:43.583 --> 09:45.126
Let's switch topics

09:45.168 --> 09:48.963
and talk about how happy I am
here in Germany,

09:49.005 --> 09:51.257
'cause it's great--
the high-speed trains,

09:51.299 --> 09:53.551
low-interest home loans
I've been told?

09:53.593 --> 09:56.096
And that hottie Angela Merkel--

09:56.137 --> 09:58.306
whoo, wouldn't mind twerking
on that Merk.

09:58.348 --> 10:00.475
- Do you think
it's appropriate to say that

10:00.517 --> 10:01.893
about our former chancellor?

10:01.935 --> 10:04.604
- Chancellor?
I hardly know her.

10:04.646 --> 10:06.106
[laughs]

10:06.147 --> 10:08.233
But I will by the end
of the day, know what I mean?

10:08.274 --> 10:10.276
- Well, congratulations,
Bumper Allen.

10:10.318 --> 10:14.322
Your various gaffes mean
it is time for our segment

10:14.364 --> 10:18.743
"You Have Gotten Yourself
in a Horrible Pickle."

10:18.785 --> 10:20.453
Now say it with me.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.579
[horn blares]

10:21.621 --> 10:24.165
all: Good luck getting

10:24.207 --> 10:26.960
out of this one!

10:27.002 --> 10:30.296
[loud pop, cheers and applause]

10:38.138 --> 10:40.140
[dramatic music]

10:40.181 --> 10:43.143
- Let's just review
what happened.

10:43.184 --> 10:44.936
We went in
to promote your song

10:44.978 --> 10:47.564
and show the world
how charming you are.

10:47.605 --> 10:50.817
We left with you admitting
it wasn't your song at all,

10:50.859 --> 10:52.777
which you didn't even promote
because you were all

10:52.819 --> 10:55.113
too busy assassinating
my reputation

10:55.155 --> 10:58.074
and objectifying Angela Merkel?

10:58.116 --> 11:00.076
[groans]
- Can I please have a chair?

11:00.118 --> 11:03.038
- No.
Chairs are for good boys.

11:03.079 --> 11:07.083
This is gonna set you way back
with the Unity Day bookers.

11:07.125 --> 11:10.045
No one is gonna take you
seriously when that comes out--

11:10.086 --> 11:11.338
or me seriously.

11:11.379 --> 11:13.465
- I was just trying
to do right by Heidi.

11:13.506 --> 11:14.799
- Oh, well, you didn't,

11:14.841 --> 11:17.302
because now the debut
of my first song ever

11:17.344 --> 11:18.928
is a PR disaster.

11:18.970 --> 11:21.097
- I'm never gonna outrun
my shameful past.

11:21.139 --> 11:24.100
This is gonna bring us
so much bad press,

11:24.142 --> 11:26.811
while Gisela
just Rollerblades her way

11:26.853 --> 11:29.773
all the way
to the newcomer spot unimpeded

11:29.814 --> 11:32.650
and, in all likelihood,
braless.

11:32.692 --> 11:34.944
- You...

11:34.986 --> 11:38.823
you are incredibly talented.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.951
But I'm out.

11:41.993 --> 11:45.705
If anyone who is not Bumper
needs me,

11:45.747 --> 11:48.124
I'll be at my favorite
abandoned factory.

11:48.166 --> 11:52.295
[train rumbling,
objects clattering]

11:52.337 --> 11:53.713
[door closes]

11:53.755 --> 11:57.884
- Maybe I should resign,
stop trying to rehab my image.

11:57.926 --> 12:00.303
- I'm gonna have to live
off German unemployment.

12:00.345 --> 12:03.431
How am I supposed to survive
on 90,000 euros a year

12:03.473 --> 12:06.059
with benefits?
- No.

12:06.101 --> 12:07.686
No, okay?

12:07.727 --> 12:10.313
You can't quit.
You can't give up on me.

12:10.355 --> 12:11.481
I will fix this.

12:11.523 --> 12:12.816
- Oh...kay.
- Oh, da.

12:12.857 --> 12:14.317
- No, shut up, listen.
Listen to me.

12:14.359 --> 12:15.318
I'm gonna fix this.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.820
I will talk to the hosts.

12:16.861 --> 12:19.739
I will explain everything,
and they'll kill the episode,

12:19.781 --> 12:23.868
and they'll probably give me
a do-over, maybe even a medal.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.413
I'll fix it.
I'm gonna fix it.

12:26.454 --> 12:27.872
[door opens]
- Oh, God.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.541
- [groans]
[door closes]

12:29.582 --> 12:32.502
[electronic music]

12:32.544 --> 12:37.340
* *

12:37.382 --> 12:40.260
- Cool. It's like
a scary adult preschool.

12:40.301 --> 12:44.681
* *

12:44.723 --> 12:45.932
- You came.

12:45.974 --> 12:47.851
- I'm sorry.
Is it okay?

12:47.892 --> 12:49.352
I just needed
a change of scenery.

12:49.394 --> 12:51.688
- This is a safe space
emotionally.

12:51.730 --> 12:53.356
Physically,
it's full of tetanus.

12:53.398 --> 12:55.150
- Oh. Eh...

12:55.191 --> 12:56.359
- So...

12:56.401 --> 12:57.861
how are you feeling?

12:57.902 --> 12:59.487
- Uh, I don't know.

12:59.529 --> 13:01.114
Not good.

13:01.156 --> 13:03.742
I know Bumper was just trying
to do the right thing,

13:03.783 --> 13:05.952
but he messed up
my whole plan--

13:05.994 --> 13:07.537
write songs in secret
for decades,

13:07.579 --> 13:08.872
release one perfect album,

13:08.913 --> 13:10.248
and then walk away
while I'm on top

13:10.290 --> 13:12.417
to become a self-righteous
animal rights activist.

13:12.459 --> 13:15.045
- Wow.

13:15.086 --> 13:17.088
You got the next six years
planned out.

13:17.130 --> 13:18.548
- Yeah.
- Sounds hard.

13:18.590 --> 13:20.050
I don't even know how
I'm gonna end this sentence.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.176
Basketball, milkshake, Denmark.

13:21.217 --> 13:23.136
- I've always been this way.

13:23.178 --> 13:24.471
There were just
so many things

13:24.512 --> 13:26.723
that I couldn't control
when I was a little kid

13:26.765 --> 13:29.017
moving around all the time.

13:29.059 --> 13:30.935
I am literally
allergic to chaos.

13:30.977 --> 13:32.520
My head swells up
like a beach ball

13:32.562 --> 13:34.272
if someone changes
a dinner reservation.

13:34.314 --> 13:36.274
- That's no way to live a life.

13:36.316 --> 13:37.400
- Mm.

13:37.442 --> 13:38.735
- That changes today.

13:38.777 --> 13:41.237
Eccentrics, gather around.

13:41.279 --> 13:44.908
It's time to fix an American.
[cheering]

13:44.949 --> 13:48.370
- Oh, have you guys
done this before?

13:48.411 --> 13:49.996
Stranger danger.

13:50.038 --> 13:52.874
- Heidi being mad at me--
worst feeling I've ever felt

13:52.916 --> 13:54.250
in my entire life,

13:54.292 --> 13:56.294
and I've had hemorrhoids before
and also now.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.254
Wait, you're not still mad
at me, are you?

13:58.296 --> 14:00.548
Please say no.
- Well, I'm angry at--

14:00.590 --> 14:01.883
- The situation?
Me too.

14:01.925 --> 14:03.927
This situation is so bad.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.387
Me, Bumper--
I'm a good guy.

14:05.428 --> 14:08.056
Frankly, this situation
can hike up a volcano

14:08.098 --> 14:09.808
and dip the tip in lava.

14:09.849 --> 14:11.685
I'm glad we're
on the same page, Pieter.

14:11.726 --> 14:14.104
- [sighs]

14:14.145 --> 14:16.106
[clears throat]
Hello.

14:16.147 --> 14:18.191
Um, Pieter Kramer,
Bumper Allen.

14:18.233 --> 14:20.694
We're just going back up
to the "Sour Pickles" studios.

14:20.735 --> 14:23.613
- I'm sorry, guys,
but your appointment is over.

14:23.655 --> 14:25.198
I cannot let you up.

14:26.616 --> 14:29.160
- [through clenched teeth]
Okay, I'll make a distraction,

14:29.202 --> 14:31.454
then you make a run
for it, okay?

14:34.457 --> 14:38.086
[normal voice]
Oh, my God, that man has a gun!

14:38.128 --> 14:40.088
- [laughing]
Where would he get a gun?

14:40.130 --> 14:42.090
This is Germany, guys.

14:43.341 --> 14:45.552
- Stupid, safe,
wonderful country.

14:47.637 --> 14:51.057
- [sighs] Okay.
Heidi...

14:51.099 --> 14:53.935
give me a tattoo...

14:53.977 --> 14:56.646
of anything you want.

14:56.688 --> 14:57.981
- What?
No.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.983
I don't know
how to tattoo someone.

15:00.025 --> 15:01.901
- Guess what.
I don't care.

15:01.943 --> 15:04.070
Put your worst art
ever out there.

15:04.112 --> 15:07.449
Nothing you make is ever
going to be as bad as this,

15:07.490 --> 15:08.533
or as permanent.

15:08.575 --> 15:10.493
- Where did you even get
this pen from?

15:10.535 --> 15:11.619
From the ground?

15:11.661 --> 15:13.204
That's where worms have sex.

15:13.246 --> 15:17.625
- If you don't tattoo me in
ten seconds, I will tattoo you.

15:17.667 --> 15:18.668
Ten...
- No you won't.

15:18.710 --> 15:19.669
- Nine...
- You're lying.

15:19.711 --> 15:20.670
- Eight...
- Okay, okay!

15:20.712 --> 15:21.713
- Se--
- Okay.

15:21.755 --> 15:23.757
I will tattoo you.

15:23.798 --> 15:25.842
Take a seat, madam.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.844
Do you want me to do it
in front of all these people?

15:27.886 --> 15:29.512
- Yep.
- Oh, so this is where--

15:29.554 --> 15:31.264
where you want me to do?

15:31.306 --> 15:32.349
Okay.

15:32.390 --> 15:34.559
I will do it.
[chuckles nervously]

15:34.601 --> 15:36.394
Mm.

15:36.436 --> 15:37.937
Does that hurt?

15:37.979 --> 15:41.649
It seems like
it doesn't hurt her at all.

15:41.691 --> 15:43.401
Oh, mm.

15:43.443 --> 15:46.946
Oh, wow,
I am really good at this.

15:46.988 --> 15:49.032
I think I might have found
my calling.

15:49.074 --> 15:51.576
This is awesome.
Oh, my God, I did it.

15:51.618 --> 15:54.496
I did it!
I did it, I did it, I did it!

15:54.537 --> 15:56.706
- You did!
What is it, though?

15:56.748 --> 15:58.041
A bowling ball?

15:58.083 --> 15:59.709
- It's my favorite actress--
Sandra Bullock.

15:59.751 --> 16:00.960
Everyone loves Sandy.

16:01.002 --> 16:02.545
- See?

16:02.587 --> 16:03.755
You weren't prepared.

16:03.797 --> 16:05.632
You can't fix it.

16:05.674 --> 16:07.926
But you survived.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.636
Though I'm not sure I will.

16:09.678 --> 16:11.596
I think you hit bone.

16:11.638 --> 16:14.391
- Oh, this feels amazing.

16:14.432 --> 16:17.268
Normally I don't go anywhere
without an A-plus health grade

16:17.310 --> 16:19.396
and a visible
choking-safety poster,

16:19.437 --> 16:22.232
but this is the beginning
of a brand-new Heidi.

16:22.273 --> 16:23.983
Do any of you guys want
a tattoo?

16:24.025 --> 16:25.568
I'm a pro now.
[all muttering]

16:25.610 --> 16:27.237
[cell phone chimes]

16:27.278 --> 16:29.114
Oh, God, it's Bumper.
- Oh.

16:29.155 --> 16:31.199
- "Couldn't even get past
the turnstiles.

16:31.241 --> 16:34.160
"Gonna drink, bye.
Siri, find the closest bar.

16:34.202 --> 16:36.746
"Oh, shit, I'm still texting.
Siri, stop texting.

16:36.788 --> 16:40.041
Oh, no, this text is going
to cost me so much money."

16:40.083 --> 16:43.503
[sighs]
You know, my plans are screwed,

16:43.545 --> 16:46.172
and things are already
out of my control.

16:46.214 --> 16:48.508
Maybe I should just improvise.

16:48.550 --> 16:50.260
Yeah.

16:50.301 --> 16:54.014
Let's go save my song.

16:54.055 --> 16:55.765
And you know what?

16:55.807 --> 16:57.142
You know what?

16:57.183 --> 17:00.145
I am finally gonna get
an electric toothbrush.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.063
What am I waiting for,
an invitation?

17:02.105 --> 17:03.481
[laughs]
Whoo!

17:09.070 --> 17:11.573
- We have an appointment.
- Of course.

17:11.614 --> 17:12.907
- Can you believe it?

17:12.949 --> 17:14.576
I didn't even know
that's what I was going to say

17:14.617 --> 17:16.161
until seconds
before I said it--

17:16.202 --> 17:18.079
parsnip, injection, catacomb.

17:18.121 --> 17:22.542
[rhythmic smacking
and clanking]

17:22.584 --> 17:26.546
- * And a decent whiskey
for the day *

17:26.588 --> 17:30.800
* When I'm gone,
when I'm gone, mm-hmm *

17:30.842 --> 17:34.596
* You're gonna miss me
when I'm gone *

17:34.637 --> 17:35.930
You'd never believe it,

17:35.972 --> 17:38.850
but this was, like,
a huge deal.

17:38.892 --> 17:40.935
Everyone loved it.
They lost their minds for it.

17:40.977 --> 17:42.771
- They loved it?

17:42.812 --> 17:44.522
- I don't get it either.

17:47.984 --> 17:49.944
I'm sorry
I messed everything up.

17:49.986 --> 17:53.239
- So Heidi
really wrote that song?

17:53.281 --> 17:55.617
Heidi?
- Yeah.

17:55.658 --> 17:57.786
It was...

17:57.827 --> 17:59.954
magic.

17:59.996 --> 18:02.290
- She's worked for me
for seven years.

18:02.332 --> 18:04.167
I knew she went
to music school,

18:04.209 --> 18:06.586
but she never told me
she could do that.

18:06.628 --> 18:09.214
I'm trying to be a manager.
I can't even detect

18:09.255 --> 18:11.675
talent directly under my nose.
- I know.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.927
- My mustache
could be Oscar Isaac,

18:13.968 --> 18:15.303
and I wouldn't know.

18:15.345 --> 18:18.056
Maybe I deserve to have
my career destroyed.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.349
- Seems harsh.

18:19.391 --> 18:21.643
- I guess
it's true what they say...

18:21.685 --> 18:24.270
you miss 100%
of the shots you take.

18:28.316 --> 18:31.319
When the episode comes out,
pin it all on me.

18:31.361 --> 18:34.197
Pin that tall tale
on this tall donkey.

18:34.239 --> 18:36.157
Tell them I demanded
you lie about the song.

18:36.199 --> 18:37.659
You can still make Unity Day.

18:37.701 --> 18:39.911
You can still be a star
without me.

18:39.953 --> 18:41.746
- Pieter, don't talk like that.

18:41.788 --> 18:44.207
- Oh, God,
now I can't even talk right?

18:44.249 --> 18:46.668
- Hey, sad boys.
Got big news.

18:46.710 --> 18:48.670
We talked to the hosts
of "Sour Pickles"--

18:48.712 --> 18:50.380
- Wait, you got
into the building? How?

18:50.422 --> 18:52.507
- It wasn't that hard.
- Was it a disguise?

18:52.549 --> 18:54.300
Or you slid
underneath the turnstiles,

18:54.342 --> 18:57.012
then whipped out nunchucks
like turtle power?

18:57.053 --> 18:59.597
- Shut up.
Shut up.

18:59.639 --> 19:01.933
We got "Sour Pickles"
to pull the episode.

19:01.975 --> 19:04.227
- All we have to do is have
Pieter give an interview

19:04.269 --> 19:06.813
about Gisela's involvement
in the DSM scandal.

19:06.855 --> 19:09.691
They've heard rumors
that she was responsible,

19:09.733 --> 19:11.609
but they've never been able
to confirm it.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.486
Pieter...

19:13.528 --> 19:15.655
is it true?

19:15.697 --> 19:16.865
- It's true.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.491
[electronic music]

19:18.533 --> 19:20.785
Ultimately,
it was my fault.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.662
I was the one
who pushed the button,

19:22.704 --> 19:26.249
but, yes, technically,
Gisela was the one

19:26.291 --> 19:27.959
who thought
to use the sound machine

19:28.001 --> 19:29.544
for Das Sound Machine.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.254
[crowd cheering]

19:31.296 --> 19:35.508
However, it was I who flipped
it on and I who was caught.

19:35.550 --> 19:37.719
I promised I would never reveal
her involvement.

19:37.761 --> 19:40.722
[crying]

19:40.764 --> 19:42.682
We were dating
and in love at the time.

19:42.724 --> 19:44.809
- [shouting in German]

19:44.851 --> 19:46.019
- I did it!

19:46.061 --> 19:48.605
* *

19:48.646 --> 19:51.566
She left me immediately
after the news broke.

19:51.608 --> 19:57.030
* *

19:57.072 --> 19:59.741
And then my heart broke.

19:59.783 --> 20:01.493
- Oh.

20:01.534 --> 20:04.245
- Pieter, I had no idea.
Why didn't you tell us?

20:04.287 --> 20:05.413
- My sense of honor

20:05.455 --> 20:07.749
always outweighed
my desire for revenge,

20:07.791 --> 20:10.418
and also, I maybe still have
stupid feelings for her,

20:10.460 --> 20:12.587
which I deal with by doing
1,000 push-ups every day.

20:12.629 --> 20:14.547
- Oh, my God,
you still love her.

20:14.589 --> 20:17.801
- Yes, I know it's shameful,
but I find her so irresistible.

20:17.842 --> 20:20.053
It's the part of me
I like the least,

20:20.095 --> 20:21.596
and I have seven nipples,

20:21.638 --> 20:23.598
and they are not
where you think they are.

20:23.640 --> 20:25.100
- Okay.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.685
So let me get this straight.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.103
If you do this,

20:28.144 --> 20:30.397
my disaster interview
goes away,

20:30.438 --> 20:33.483
and you throw dirt on
our main rival for Unity Day,

20:33.525 --> 20:36.569
and the story makes you seem
more sympathetic,

20:36.611 --> 20:40.490
and it helps repair
your reputation,

20:40.532 --> 20:43.535
and it gets you
over your toxic ex?

20:43.576 --> 20:45.787
Guys?

20:45.829 --> 20:47.789
Okay, I'll be the one
to say it.

20:47.831 --> 20:49.290
This certainly feels

20:49.332 --> 20:51.918
like a "kill a bunch of birds
with one stone" situ-aish.

20:51.960 --> 20:55.797
* We making down pillows
tonight, boys *

20:55.839 --> 20:57.048
And girls.

20:57.090 --> 21:00.051
- Never do that again.
But maybe he's right.

21:00.093 --> 21:02.637
Gisela deserves everything
that's coming to her.

21:02.679 --> 21:07.350
Gut her, Pieter.
End it once and for all.

21:07.392 --> 21:09.310
- This is
the right thing to do.

21:09.352 --> 21:11.271
Gisela's your competition.

21:11.312 --> 21:13.106
[sighs] She's also bad,

21:13.148 --> 21:14.816
even if she also
makes me horny

21:14.858 --> 21:16.526
and the thought of hurting her
makes me feel

21:16.568 --> 21:19.154
like I'm wearing someone else's
wet bathing suit.

21:19.195 --> 21:23.324
Oh, why must I still pine
for her sweet sherbet kisses?

21:23.366 --> 21:25.160
What a cruel reality of life

21:25.201 --> 21:27.620
that we can't choose
for whom we ooze.

21:27.662 --> 21:31.207
[sighs] I'm just glad I can do
something to help you, Bumper.

21:31.249 --> 21:32.792
- Oh, God.

21:34.836 --> 21:36.838
You can't do this.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.423
- What do you mean?

21:38.465 --> 21:39.883
- It's not right.

21:39.924 --> 21:42.010
I mean, sure,
it would get me off the hook,

21:42.052 --> 21:43.887
but that's not your job--

21:43.928 --> 21:46.848
certainly not at the expense
of your heart.

21:46.890 --> 21:48.266
No.

21:48.308 --> 21:50.852
It's my job.

21:50.894 --> 21:52.354
I mean, you got me here.

21:52.395 --> 21:55.690
You set me on the path
to Unity Day.

21:55.732 --> 21:57.901
[sighs]
I have to right this ship.

21:57.942 --> 22:00.445
[sucks teeth]
I mean, it's my dream.

22:00.487 --> 22:03.114
I have to start taking
responsibility for my actions.

22:03.156 --> 22:04.908
- Then what are
you going to do?

22:04.949 --> 22:06.868
- [sighs] I think
I have to do something

22:06.910 --> 22:09.037
I haven't done
in a very long time.

22:09.079 --> 22:11.373
- What's that?

22:11.414 --> 22:14.292
- Try to think of something.

22:14.334 --> 22:15.877
- Yeah.

22:15.919 --> 22:19.422
[dramatic music]

22:19.464 --> 22:21.883
- I told my friends
I'd fix this, but...

22:21.925 --> 22:23.802
I have no idea how.

22:23.843 --> 22:26.680
- It's like my coach from
the East German Olympics team

22:26.721 --> 22:28.348
used to say--
don't do the high jump

22:28.390 --> 22:31.059
if you've taken
the steroids for shot put.

22:31.101 --> 22:33.520
Play to your strengths.

22:33.561 --> 22:36.106
- [chuckles] Yeah.

22:36.147 --> 22:39.317
Well, the only thing
I'm good at is ruining things.

22:39.359 --> 22:43.071
* *

22:43.113 --> 22:44.197
Wait a minute.

22:44.239 --> 22:45.490
- No.

22:45.532 --> 22:49.160
* *

22:49.202 --> 22:51.413
- [chuckles]

22:51.454 --> 22:55.834
* *

22:55.875 --> 22:57.377
- Bumper.

22:59.421 --> 23:01.548
- Tell me you didn't call
an emergency team meeting

23:01.589 --> 23:02.924
to get matching jackets.

23:02.966 --> 23:04.926
- No, but we should put
a pin in that,

23:04.968 --> 23:07.512
because that is
a very, very good idea.

23:07.554 --> 23:11.182
Okay, so you know how
I always mess everything up?

23:11.224 --> 23:12.225
- Yes.
- Oh, yes.

23:12.267 --> 23:13.393
- Big-time.

23:13.435 --> 23:17.439
- Okay, well,
what if this time,

23:17.480 --> 23:20.734
I mess something up
on purpose...

23:20.775 --> 23:22.610
to help us?

23:22.652 --> 23:25.280
Would you guys trust me
to do that?

23:25.321 --> 23:27.282
- Yeah, actually.
- Actually, yes.

23:27.323 --> 23:28.658
- Thank you.

23:28.700 --> 23:30.952
Because what I have in store
is gonna make

23:30.994 --> 23:35.081
"Sour Pickles"
look like small p--

23:35.123 --> 23:37.167
pickles.

23:37.208 --> 23:39.294
[distant cheering]
- Yeah.

23:39.336 --> 23:40.754
- Here we go.

23:40.795 --> 23:45.300
[crowd cheering]

23:45.342 --> 23:48.261
- Hello, my little Gise-lads

23:48.303 --> 23:51.514
and Gise-lasses!

23:51.556 --> 23:55.769
- And what's up,
all my Bumper Gump shrimps?

23:55.810 --> 23:58.480
- Yes!
Bumper Gump shrimps!

23:58.521 --> 24:00.315
Bumper Gump shrimps!
- Gump shrimps!

24:00.357 --> 24:03.443
- Bumper Gump shrimps--
shrimps...

24:03.485 --> 24:04.903
- [through clenched teeth]
What the hell

24:04.944 --> 24:06.696
do you think you're doing,
you silly little kinder man?

24:06.738 --> 24:08.907
Are you perhaps lost
on your way

24:08.948 --> 24:12.202
to one of Berlin's many
world-famous chocolate shops

24:12.243 --> 24:13.787
or museums?
[laughs]

24:13.828 --> 24:15.580
- No, I was just thinking,

24:15.622 --> 24:18.458
what if we turn
this little concert

24:18.500 --> 24:21.044
into a little riff-off?

24:21.086 --> 24:22.754
[crowd cheering]

24:22.796 --> 24:26.007
- Of course you are challenging
me to a whiff-off.

24:26.049 --> 24:28.760
You Americans, you are
obsessed with your whiff-offs.

24:28.802 --> 24:30.762
- Whiff-off?
- Yeah, a whiff-off.

24:30.804 --> 24:32.597
- It's a riff-off.
- Whiff-off.

24:32.639 --> 24:34.516
- Riff-off.
- You said whiff-off.

24:34.557 --> 24:36.101
I said whiff-off.
- Okay.

24:36.142 --> 24:39.771
- And I would love to be a part
of the whiff-off,

24:39.813 --> 24:42.065
but, unfortunately,
the a cappella bylaws

24:42.107 --> 24:44.317
clearly say a "quowum"
of a cappella peers

24:44.359 --> 24:45.568
must be "pwesent"

24:45.610 --> 24:47.487
for a whiff-off
to be legally binding.

24:47.529 --> 24:49.239
So it's sad, yeah.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.658
- It's actually not sad, nein.

24:51.700 --> 24:53.118
It's not sad at all,

24:53.159 --> 24:57.580
because if you were to reread
page 45, paragraph 7,

24:57.622 --> 24:59.040
it clearly states,

24:59.082 --> 25:02.085
"In the case
of an international riff-off

25:02.127 --> 25:05.755
"within 100 kilometers
of a fordable river,

25:05.797 --> 25:08.466
the quorum can be waived"!

25:08.508 --> 25:10.135
[cheers and applause]

25:10.176 --> 25:13.430
- All right, then,
what are the stakes?

25:13.471 --> 25:15.223
- If I win,

25:15.265 --> 25:16.891
I get to say whatever I want

25:16.933 --> 25:19.227
to all of your followers
on your livestream.

25:19.269 --> 25:21.396
all: Ooh!

25:21.438 --> 25:24.566
- Okay, and, uh, when I win?

25:24.607 --> 25:27.694
- If you win, I will...

25:27.736 --> 25:29.320
go back to America...

25:29.362 --> 25:32.073
all: Ooh!
[cheers and applause]

25:32.115 --> 25:33.491
Today.

25:35.493 --> 25:38.580
- All right, then,
I agree to your terms.

25:38.621 --> 25:42.250
But we are on my home turf,

25:42.292 --> 25:45.545
so the theme is Germany.

25:45.587 --> 25:48.340
You will sing German songs,

25:48.381 --> 25:52.761
and I will sing American songs.

25:52.802 --> 25:54.804
[laughs]

25:54.846 --> 25:56.890
[cheers and applause]

25:56.931 --> 25:59.225
- You're about to go down.

25:59.267 --> 26:01.936
* Here I am *

26:01.978 --> 26:05.231
* Rock you like a hurricane *

26:05.273 --> 26:07.067
* Come on, come on,
come on, come on, come on! *

26:07.108 --> 26:09.319
- [beatboxing]
- * Here I am *

26:09.361 --> 26:10.528
* Rock you like a-- *

26:10.570 --> 26:11.946
- * But I have to charge *

26:11.988 --> 26:14.199
* My milkshake brings
all the boys to the yard *

26:14.240 --> 26:16.159
* And they're like,
it's better than yours *

26:16.201 --> 26:18.203
* Damn right,
it's better than yours *

26:18.244 --> 26:19.913
* I can teach you *
[singers vocalizing]

26:19.954 --> 26:22.415
* I know you want it *

26:22.457 --> 26:24.459
* The things that makes me-- *

26:28.963 --> 26:31.758

26:31.800 --> 26:33.426
- * Do what I wanna do *

26:33.468 --> 26:35.345
singers:
* It's my prerogative *

26:35.387 --> 26:37.472
- * Oh, no, no *
[all beatboxing]

26:37.514 --> 26:39.641
* Don't ask me questions *

26:39.683 --> 26:42.102
* Why am I so real? *

26:42.143 --> 26:43.728
* But they don't understand-- *

26:43.770 --> 26:45.980
- * No one understands
what Major Tom sees *

26:46.022 --> 26:47.399
* Now the light commands *

26:47.440 --> 26:48.942
- You're supposed
to be helping me.

26:48.983 --> 26:51.069
* I'm coming home *
- * Four, three, two, one *

26:51.111 --> 26:54.239
* Yeah! *
- * Earth below us *

26:54.280 --> 26:56.491
* Drifting, falling *

26:56.533 --> 26:58.660
- You're supposed to be doing
my song.

26:58.702 --> 27:00.662
- * Floating weightless *
- Oh!

27:00.704 --> 27:02.372
- * Calling, calling-- *

27:02.414 --> 27:05.250
- * We could be homeless,
we could be broke *

27:05.291 --> 27:09.004
* As long as you love me,
I'll be your platinum *

27:09.045 --> 27:12.424
* I'll be your silver,
I'll be your gold *

27:12.465 --> 27:13.925
* As long as you love-- *

27:13.967 --> 27:17.721
- * No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no *

27:17.762 --> 27:20.181
both: * No, no *

27:20.223 --> 27:22.100
- Oh, Gisela.

27:22.142 --> 27:23.268
Ooh, you lose.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.561
- What do you mean?

27:24.602 --> 27:26.604
- You see, Justin Bieber...

27:26.646 --> 27:27.981
is Canadian!

27:28.023 --> 27:28.982
all: Ooh.

27:29.024 --> 27:30.442
- Those were your rules, so--

27:30.483 --> 27:34.946
- But he lives in America,
and he loves money and fame,

27:34.988 --> 27:37.073
and he peed in the bucket.

27:37.115 --> 27:41.494
- And yet his blood runs maple.

27:41.536 --> 27:43.413
[Canadian accent]
Sorry "aboot" it.

27:43.455 --> 27:44.956
[laughs]
Where's the livestream?

27:44.998 --> 27:46.166
Hey!

27:46.207 --> 27:48.335
What's up?
I'm Bumper Allen!

27:48.376 --> 27:51.212
Check out my new song,
written by my girl

27:51.254 --> 27:53.506
Heidi Miller!

27:53.548 --> 27:56.593
[cheers and applause]

27:56.634 --> 28:01.056
You are so lucky you have
an ex who is looking after you.

28:01.097 --> 28:03.683
Your career almost ended today.

28:03.725 --> 28:06.144
I know about the thing.

28:06.186 --> 28:08.396
- The bathroom looked like that
before I went in there,

28:08.438 --> 28:10.023
I swear.

28:10.065 --> 28:12.776
- I'm talking
about the DSM thing.

28:12.817 --> 28:16.988
Your thing sounds gross.

28:17.030 --> 28:18.365
I won!

28:18.406 --> 28:21.534
[cheers and applause]

28:21.576 --> 28:23.578
[upbeat music]

28:23.620 --> 28:25.497
- Off.
- Thank you.

28:25.538 --> 28:26.664
Thank you.

28:26.706 --> 28:33.672

28:40.095 --> 28:43.640
[music playing softly,
indistinct chatter]

28:43.682 --> 28:45.266
- Pieter just heard
that "Sour Pickles"

28:45.308 --> 28:47.435
pulled your interview
since you scooped them

28:47.477 --> 28:48.770
on releasing your song.

28:48.812 --> 28:50.980
- Just to say it,
I would love to work with you

28:51.022 --> 28:52.315
whenever you're ready.

28:52.357 --> 28:53.942
We are the most talented
here, anyway.

28:53.983 --> 28:56.986
- You know it. [chuckles]
- [grunts]

28:57.028 --> 29:00.073
[groans] Sorry, my tattoo's
a little tender.

29:00.115 --> 29:00.949
- Sorry.

29:00.990 --> 29:03.243
- Team, great work today.

29:03.284 --> 29:05.912
And seeing Gisela
glistening up there onstage

29:05.954 --> 29:09.499
inspired me to make
a resolution of the heart.

29:09.541 --> 29:11.126
I deserve better
than to be in love

29:11.167 --> 29:13.128
with the very woman
who destroyed me.

29:13.169 --> 29:15.547
I will try to have
the self-respect of a man

29:15.588 --> 29:17.590
with way fewer nipples.

29:17.632 --> 29:19.259
From here on out,

29:19.300 --> 29:21.886
I will no longer be
under the spell of Gisela.

29:21.928 --> 29:25.640
From now on,
my heart belongs to you all.

29:25.682 --> 29:27.225
- Turtle power.

29:27.267 --> 29:29.477
- Turtle power.
- Turtle power.

29:29.519 --> 29:31.062
- Whoo!

29:37.318 --> 29:38.445
- Hello, Pieter.

29:40.238 --> 29:41.948
- Gisela.

29:41.990 --> 29:44.784
- I heard you saved
my hide today,

29:44.826 --> 29:48.621
and so I thought
you might as well feel it.

29:48.663 --> 29:51.624
[intriguing music]

29:51.666 --> 29:57.213
