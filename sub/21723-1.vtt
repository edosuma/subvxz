of Oaxacan sensimilla in that thing.

08:25.505 --> 08:27.632
Wow. That's, uh... ambitious.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.926

too, man.

Well, uh, they kick off their shoes here,

the fifteen extra rooms.

10:07.565 --> 10:08.565
There's a chapel.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.861
There's a basement that can be turned
into a game room or a man-cave.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.082
Sure. Yeah. Right this way.

10:24.707 --> 10:27.377
Yeah, I mean, as you can see,
it's a bit of a fixer-upper,

10:27.460 --> 10:29.712
but you know, with the right touch...

10:29.796 --> 10:30.797
Oh...

Mm-hmm.

10:49.357 --> 10:50.692
Just, you know... [stammers]

10:50.775 --> 10:53.027
There's another couple
who's very interested.

10:53.111 --> 10:54.904
You're kidding me? Who?

10:54.988 --> 10:57.574
This very wealthy couple.
Just, like, dot-com money.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.076
Always wanted to retire in a nunnery.
Same old story.

11:00.160 --> 11:02.720
- I shouldn't even be showing it to you.
- I'll beat their price.

11:03.329 --> 11:05.415
Whatever they're offering,
I'll offer more.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.498
Really?

11:07.292 --> 11:09.127
The end is coming, Gary.

11:10.211 --> 11:13.089
Blood will rain,
and crows will darken the sky,

11:13.172 --> 11:15.049
the oceans will boil over.

11:16.843 --> 11:18.720
Money truly is no object.

11:20.054 --> 11:21.347
Well, that's fantastic.

11:21.431 --> 11:25.143
I mean, not the blood boiling
and the sky and stuff,

11:25.226 --> 11:27.145

11:32.859 --> 11:33.860

11:42.785 --> 11:45.747
Sorry. My stepson got into
a little trouble at school,

11:45.830 --> 11:47.582
probably just throwing spitballs.

11:47.665 --> 11:50.710
Ah, the Lord will never give you
more than you can handle.

11:50.793 --> 11:52.545
- Got it.
- So, it's a deal then?

11:53.171 --> 11:55.965
Yeah, absolutely. We have a deal.

11:56.507 --> 11:59.594
- [siren wails]
- [police radio chatter]

12:08.853 --> 12:10.104
Hi. Um...

12:10.855 --> 12:12.398
I'm here to pick up my stepson.

12:22.367 --> 12:25.078
Lucas? Are you okay?

12:25.536 --> 12:26.536
What happened?

12:29.290 --> 12:30.833
You're Lucas' father?

12:30.917 --> 12:33.378
Yeah. Or, I mean, I'm his stepfather.

12:33.962 --> 12:34.963
Please come in.

12:36.631 --> 12:37.751
[whispers] It's okay, buddy.

12:40.343 --> 12:43.012
- Have a seat, Mr...
- Uh, you can call me Gary.

12:43.096 --> 12:45.932
Uh, Mr. Gary, I'm Principal Chandler,

12:46.015 --> 12:49.477
and this is school psychiatrist,
Dr. Farrow.

12:50.895 --> 12:51.771
Okay.

12:51.854 --> 12:53.064
Mm-hmm.

12:54.023 --> 12:57.193
How long have you been
the child's stepfather?

12:57.276 --> 13:00.655
Well, his mother and I
just recently got married.

13:00.738 --> 13:01.990
Mm-hmm.

13:02.073 --> 13:06.327
Mr. Gary, have you noticed
any odd behavior from Lucas?

13:07.036 --> 13:10.623
No. I mean, he's been a little withdrawn
since the wedding.

13:10.707 --> 13:11.833
Mm-hmm.

13:12.208 --> 13:14.669
I'm sorry.
W-Why do you keep "mm-hmm-ing"?

13:16.963 --> 13:19.007
Mr. Gary, do you believe
in corporal punishment?

13:20.258 --> 13:21.134
No.

13:21.217 --> 13:22.802
Were you neglected as a child?

13:23.219 --> 13:24.303
No.

13:25.096 --> 13:26.222
Not entirely.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.433
M-Maybe a little.

13:28.516 --> 13:31.144
What was your relationship
with your own father?

13:31.811 --> 13:34.939
- I didn't know my father.
- I see.

13:35.023 --> 13:38.151
Do you mind telling me
what this is all about? What did Lucas do?

13:39.152 --> 13:41.529
I'm afraid he spoke out of turn in class.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.781
Well, this is quite the response.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.493
He told his science teacher Mrs. Deeter
to go to hell.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.413
Oh. Okay. Well, yeah, that is pretty bad.

13:50.496 --> 13:52.540
Then she poured lye on her face

13:52.623 --> 13:54.959
and hucked herself out
of a third story window.

13:55.543 --> 13:57.628
Speared herself on the fence outside.

13:57.712 --> 13:58.712
[balls click]

14:07.472 --> 14:10.058
Now, we're not blaming Lucas,

14:10.141 --> 14:12.560
but we've gone through his file,

14:12.643 --> 14:17.357
and he seems to have a habit
of pushing people over the edge.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.120
We're gonna have to suspend him
for a week.

14:19.776 --> 14:22.153
- Are you sure that's necessary?
- I'm afraid so.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.405
And we want him to see a counselor.

14:24.489 --> 14:27.283
I'm gonna recommend group therapy
for you as well.

14:27.367 --> 14:31.162
Somewhere where you can work out
some of your own father issues.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.498
Honestly, I don't have any father issues.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.249
You can work that out in group.

14:40.296 --> 14:41.296
[door opens]

14:42.715 --> 14:43.715
Oh, my God.

14:44.550 --> 14:45.843
[man grunting]

14:48.679 --> 14:49.764
That's terrible.

14:51.140 --> 14:53.684
I know. It's really tragic.

14:53.768 --> 14:56.145
The way they're paying teachers,
I'm really not surprised.

14:56.229 --> 14:58.731
I just can't imagine
what she must have been going through.

14:58.815 --> 15:00.233
Shoot. I just...

15:00.316 --> 15:03.319
I was hoping that Lucas would make
some new friends in this school,

15:03.403 --> 15:05.255
and now nobody's gonna come
to his birthday party.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.698
I'm not sure that should be
your biggest concern, hon.

15:07.782 --> 15:10.618
I met with a clown today, Gary. A clown.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.870
Do you know how hard it is
to have a conversation

15:12.954 --> 15:15.081
with a fully-grown man in a clown suit?

15:15.164 --> 15:17.959
Okay. I'm sorry, I forgot about that.
How did that go?

15:18.042 --> 15:20.586
Terribly. He's double-booked on Saturday,
and he can't do it.

15:21.712 --> 15:24.507
It doesn't matter now.
I'll just call his birthday off.

15:24.590 --> 15:26.217
I'm sure people will still come.

15:26.300 --> 15:29.679
And I can help you find another clown
if it means that much.

15:30.138 --> 15:32.306
It's not fair
that they singled out Lucas.

15:32.390 --> 15:35.810
If she's that fragile,
then she shouldn't be teaching, right?

15:35.893 --> 15:38.396
- Did you tell them that?
- No, I tried, but...

15:38.479 --> 15:42.608
They were really focused on the fact that
I'm sort of a new figure in the house,

15:42.692 --> 15:44.694
and they were acting like it was my fault.

15:45.611 --> 15:46.529
They were?

15:46.612 --> 15:50.199
Yeah, and they want me to see a therapist.
Isn't that weird?

15:51.909 --> 15:53.161
What, you think I should?

15:53.244 --> 15:55.246
I just... I mean...

15:56.205 --> 15:59.041
you're not exactly having the easiest time
communicating with him.

15:59.125 --> 16:01.210
But this isn't about me, Sam.

16:01.294 --> 16:04.505
This is about Lucas.
What if there's something wrong with him?

16:04.589 --> 16:06.841
There is nothing wrong with Lucas!

16:07.300 --> 16:11.012
[bangs table] Damn it! Why is everything
always blamed on the child?

16:13.931 --> 16:15.224
[door slams shut]

16:19.812 --> 16:21.606
Hey, honey.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.108
I am sorry.

16:25.401 --> 16:28.905
It's just not fair, you know.
I mean, he's already been through so much.

16:30.615 --> 16:31.824
He's a good kid, Gary.

16:31.908 --> 16:34.785
He just...
He needs a positive male role model.

16:34.869 --> 16:38.289
And every time I think
I found the perfect guy...

16:41.000 --> 16:45.463
he winds up turning against him
and going crazy or...

16:46.839 --> 16:49.675
[crying]
dying in a horrible mulching accident.

16:49.759 --> 16:52.595
- What? Hey. Hey, come here.
- [crying]

16:52.678 --> 16:55.681
I am so sorry, honey. I didn't know that.

16:55.765 --> 16:59.268
He just... He can't deal
with any more rejection, Gary.

16:59.352 --> 17:03.564
All right?
You... you have to be on his side.

17:03.648 --> 17:05.775
- I am on his side.
- You're just saying that.

17:05.858 --> 17:06.943
I'm not.

17:07.026 --> 17:09.237
Sam, I love you.

17:09.320 --> 17:11.531
Okay? And I didn't just make
a commitment to you.

17:11.614 --> 17:12.949
I made a commitment to him.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.158
[sobbing exhale]

17:14.242 --> 17:15.451
Do you understand?

17:16.035 --> 17:19.247
Now, I'm gonna go up there
and have a heart-to-heart with him.

17:19.330 --> 17:22.083
- I'm gonna turn this into a bonding thing.
- Okay.

17:24.252 --> 17:25.336
Okay.

17:27.588 --> 17:28.588
Hey, Gary?

17:30.716 --> 17:32.051
You're gonna be a great dad.

17:33.886 --> 17:36.264
[inhales and exhales]

17:40.184 --> 17:41.435
Oh, shit.

17:48.234 --> 17:50.444
Hey, Lucas? Can I come in?

17:50.528 --> 17:51.529
[door creaks open]

17:52.863 --> 17:54.490
Hey, pal. How are you feeling?

18:02.498 --> 18:03.791
Is the cable out, or...?

18:05.751 --> 18:07.753
Well, TV sucks anyway.

18:07.837 --> 18:11.132
It's kinda cool to just use
your imagination, right?

18:13.884 --> 18:15.177
[static hissing]

18:18.097 --> 18:19.807
Okay, um...

18:21.809 --> 18:27.189
Listen, Lucas, I'm sure it seems like
we've been moving really fast,

18:27.690 --> 18:30.109
but I'm your stepfather now...

18:30.192 --> 18:32.820
[demonic voice] Get out!

18:32.903 --> 18:34.905
Yeah, okay. We'll just talk later.

18:34.989 --> 18:36.240
Or whenever you want.

18:36.866 --> 18:37.866
Okay?

18:43.914 --> 18:44.832
[sighs]

18:44.915 --> 18:45.915
How'd it go?

18:46.250 --> 18:50.004
Oh. Uh, he just told me he wanted some
alone time through his, uh...

18:50.087 --> 18:51.172
goat puppet.

18:51.255 --> 18:53.341
Oh, yeah. That's his friend Reeroy.

18:53.424 --> 18:55.718
- Reeroy.
- [chuckles] He loves playing with him.

18:55.801 --> 18:56.886
Good.

18:58.721 --> 19:00.848
I'll just let him have
a little Reeroy time then

19:00.931 --> 19:02.516
and check in with him later.

19:02.600 --> 19:03.601
Okay.

19:07.229 --> 19:08.856
[Al] <i>You know what pisses me off?</i>

19:08.939 --> 19:11.901
Kids nowadays, they don't even know
what's rad when they see it now.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.319
When I was that age,

19:13.402 --> 19:17.531
all I wanted was a '72 Chevrolet,
El Camino Monster Truck,

19:17.615 --> 19:20.326
mounted on top
of some 66-inch Goodyear tires...

19:20.951 --> 19:22.703
with an alcohol fuel injected
turbo engine.

19:22.787 --> 19:24.080
- Preach.
- Yep.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.957
And now that I got one,
I got a stepkid,

19:27.041 --> 19:29.126
and all he wants to do
is watch<i> Pitch Perfect.</i>

19:29.210 --> 19:31.879
<i>Pitch Perfect One,
Pitch Perfect Two, Pitch Perfect Three.</i>

19:31.962 --> 19:32.797
- Shit.
- Yeah.

19:32.880 --> 19:34.799
"Jam" me man. Let's put on some Rush.

19:34.882 --> 19:37.819
Put your hand on a speaker, your hand
on your heart, see if you feel something.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.428
I said, "What are you feeling?"

19:39.512 --> 19:40.513
He said, "Nothing."

19:41.722 --> 19:44.517
I said, "That's America."
He didn't get it.

19:45.184 --> 19:46.060
[sniffles]

19:46.143 --> 19:47.853
So, that's kind of where I'm at right now.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.647
Thank you for sharing, Al.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.065
- Good job.
- Nice work.

19:51.315 --> 19:55.236
Okay, we've got a new guy.
Everybody, please welcome Gary.

19:55.319 --> 19:56.779
- Hi, Jerry.
- All right, Gary.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.572
- Welcome, man.
- Let's go, Gar!

19:59.198 --> 20:02.201
Gary, can you share a little about
what you're going through?

20:02.284 --> 20:05.246
Oh. Uh, no, thank you.
I'm just here to watch.

20:05.329 --> 20:07.498
No, you're not here to watch.

20:07.581 --> 20:09.959
- You're here to participate.
- This is a safe space, bro.

20:10.042 --> 20:12.795
- Okay, all right.
- [Al] You got this, man.

20:12.878 --> 20:14.380
Okay, um...

20:14.463 --> 20:17.466
Well, my wife and I
just recently got married.

20:17.550 --> 20:20.261
And you know,
I'm having a little tiny bit of trouble

20:20.344 --> 20:22.388
bonding with my new stepson Lucas.

20:22.471 --> 20:23.723
And how old is he?

20:24.140 --> 20:25.266
He's about to turn six.

20:25.516 --> 20:28.018
Yeah, we're actually having a party
for him on Saturday.

20:28.102 --> 20:29.770
His real birthday's next Wednesday.

20:29.854 --> 20:32.189
Ah, that's a great age.
He's still very malleable.

20:32.273 --> 20:34.358
And how is it with his mother?

20:34.442 --> 20:36.068
Oh, uh, it's going great there.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.904
I mean, she's just amazing
in so many ways.

20:38.988 --> 20:39.988
[coughs] Blowjobs.

20:40.614 --> 20:41.699
[laughing]

20:41.782 --> 20:45.161
But the fact that you don't get along
with her son

20:45.244 --> 20:46.996
is putting a strain on the marriage?

20:47.079 --> 20:49.623
No. Not really.

20:49.707 --> 20:53.627
It will.
The mom's always gonna side with the son.

20:54.086 --> 20:56.297
Can you tell us a little more about Lucas?

20:57.006 --> 20:58.466
Well, um...

21:00.342 --> 21:01.927
He never really looks me in the eye.

21:03.012 --> 21:04.430
Doesn't talk much,

21:04.513 --> 21:07.308
uh, except when he tells his teachers
to go to hell

21:07.391 --> 21:11.979
or yells at me to get out
of his room using this, uh...

21:12.772 --> 21:14.398
weird little goat puppet thing.

21:15.107 --> 21:18.569
And I-I just...
I get this sense that he's...

21:18.652 --> 21:20.070
That he's evil incarnate?

21:22.782 --> 21:23.782
Yeah.

21:24.867 --> 21:27.244
Well, you're lucky, man.
I got girls. Twins.

21:27.328 --> 21:30.247
And they wake up every morning
literally plotting ways to torture me.

21:30.331 --> 21:35.044
This morning, they replaced my toothpaste
with my wife's Vagisil.

21:35.127 --> 21:36.127
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:36.170 --> 21:37.922
Vagisil. That ain't shit.

21:38.589 --> 21:42.384
Yesterday, my stepson asked me
when I was gonna die.

21:43.052 --> 21:45.513
I told him,
"Listen, I don't know that. I...

21:45.596 --> 21:47.264
That's up to God."

21:47.348 --> 21:50.351
He said, "Well, when God does take you,
can I have your van?"

21:51.310 --> 21:52.436
He's five.

21:52.520 --> 21:54.980
- Well, at least he likes trucks.
- Fuck that, dude.

21:55.064 --> 21:56.833
- Jeremy pissed on my khakis.
- My kid's worse.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.526
My son shit in my sock drawer!

21:59.193 --> 22:01.403
- I stand corrected.
- It's the top drawer.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.198
So, he blamed it on the cat,

22:04.281 --> 22:08.661
but I know it wasn't the cat
because there were Jujubes in the shit,

22:08.744 --> 22:10.905
after I looked in it.
You want to talk about malleable?

22:11.497 --> 22:16.460
And that means that he crawled up
onto the fucking dresser,

22:16.544 --> 22:20.422
turned around, grabbed onto the mirror,
and then fucking opened the top drawer,

22:20.506 --> 22:22.591
and then shit into the top drawer.

22:23.092 --> 22:26.929
In the mirror, he was looking at himself
knowing what he was doing,

22:27.012 --> 22:28.597
shitting in my sock drawer.

22:28.681 --> 22:32.059
And if you think I won't shit
in his backpack now,

22:32.142 --> 22:33.161
you got another thing coming.

22:33.185 --> 22:34.645
- Wayne.
- I have it in the trunk.

22:34.728 --> 22:36.522
I'm not saying we all have to do it,
but...

22:36.605 --> 22:39.567
- I'm gonna pencil you in for twice a week.
- Thanks.

22:39.650 --> 22:41.235
And as for you, Gary,

22:41.318 --> 22:43.404
birthdays are a very special time
for kids.

22:43.487 --> 22:47.825
If you step up on this, it could be
a great breakthrough for both of you.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.427

[grunting]

23:06.802 --> 23:08.095
- Oh.
- How we doing there?

23:08.178 --> 23:10.764
Honestly, it's like<i> Lord of the Flies.</i>
It's really cool.

23:10.848 --> 23:11.932
- Everybody good?
- Hey.

23:12.016 --> 23:13.809
Great? Good? Okay.

23:13.892 --> 23:15.894
- Honey, this is amazing.
- Yeah?

23:15.978 --> 23:18.606
- Thank you so much for helping out.
- Yeah.

23:18.689 --> 23:21.191
- Where did you find the clown?
- I have my connections.

23:22.067 --> 23:24.320
Hey, do you think Lucas
is enjoying himself?

23:25.654 --> 23:26.822
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

23:26.905 --> 23:28.032
Yeah, of course he is.

23:28.699 --> 23:30.200
Oh, hey, Gar Bear, think fast!

23:30.951 --> 23:32.703
- Hey, Al.
- Nice catch, buddy.

23:32.786 --> 23:33.996
- [laughs]
- Thanks.

23:34.079 --> 23:36.915
- This is a great party you got going here.
- Thank you.

23:36.999 --> 23:38.500
Do you guys know my wife Wendy?

23:38.584 --> 23:39.793
- Hi.
- Hi, nice to meet you.

23:39.877 --> 23:42.087
- You, too.
- I'm Samantha, this is Gary.

23:42.171 --> 23:44.465
- And is that your boy Lucas?
- Yeah.

23:44.548 --> 23:46.050
- Birthday boy.
- He's so cute.

23:46.133 --> 23:47.885
- Thanks.
- [Al] You want another drink?

23:47.968 --> 23:50.262
I make a killer Mantini, bro.

23:50.346 --> 23:52.181
Come on! Let's go get gross.

23:52.264 --> 23:53.349
- Okay.
- Go, have fun.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.850
- [liquid splashes]
- [ice rattles]

23:54.934 --> 23:56.894
- Cheers. Mm-hmm.
- We're doin' it.

23:57.728 --> 24:00.481
- Ah.
- His real dad is a total fucking loser.

24:00.564 --> 24:04.777
Sits at home all day long, smoking pot
just to keep himself from freaking out.

24:04.860 --> 24:07.237
That's no way to raise a kid.
You gotta stay sharp.

24:07.321 --> 24:10.050
We gotta be ready at a moment's call.
You never know what's gonna happen.

24:10.074 --> 24:12.576
- We're kinda like first responders.
- That's real.

24:13.202 --> 24:15.037
Here's to getting hammered
and staying sharp.

24:15.120 --> 24:16.830
- All right.
- Cheers, brothers.

24:19.124 --> 24:21.627
Dude, where did you find this clown?

24:22.628 --> 24:25.714
- [Al] Your clown's kinda blowing it, bro.
- Oh, he was supposed to be good.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.842
So what's up with Lucas' real dad?
You have to deal with him much?

24:28.926 --> 24:31.679
No, actually, Samantha doesn't even like
talking about him.

24:31.762 --> 24:35.516
Consider yourself lucky. I hate
taking the kids to their real dad's house.

24:35.599 --> 24:39.311
They come home with stories like,
"Oh, my God, he's so awesome.

24:39.395 --> 24:42.398
He let us play Minecraft for, like,
17 hours straight!"

24:42.481 --> 24:44.441
Then I got to deal
with their rage, you know?

24:44.525 --> 24:46.819
If I were you, I'd find out about
the kid's dad,

24:46.902 --> 24:50.030
because that DNA stuff
can be really wicked.

24:50.114 --> 24:52.157
You gotta find out
if he's got DNA, dude.

24:52.241 --> 24:54.868
- No, we all have DNA, guys, so...
- I'm not sure we do.

24:54.952 --> 24:57.329
- [dad] I thought it was VNA...
- [dad 2] No, DNA.

24:57.413 --> 24:59.873
- [dad 3] I guess...
- [dad 2] It's your genes.

24:59.957 --> 25:02.143
- [dad] The kid has it.
- [dad 3] He's definitely got it.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.211
[dad 2] No, it's not a disease.

25:04.294 --> 25:07.256
- It's actually... no, we all have DNA.
- [dad] You don't want it...

25:07.798 --> 25:08.966
I do?

25:09.842 --> 25:12.261
[whimpering]

25:12.344 --> 25:15.097
Never mind. That clown is fucking awesome!

25:15.180 --> 25:18.475
[screaming]

25:18.559 --> 25:21.228
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Oh.

25:21.311 --> 25:22.771
- [yells]
- Oh, shit.

25:22.855 --> 25:23.939
[dad] Oh.

25:24.022 --> 25:27.234
- It couldn't have worked out better.
- Yeah. Is that part of his act?

25:27.317 --> 25:28.444
[Al] That's not safe.

25:29.695 --> 25:32.489
- I am so, so sorry about all this.
- [whimpering]

25:32.573 --> 25:34.950
You know what?
Here's a little something extra for you.

25:36.076 --> 25:37.453
I am so sorry.

25:38.287 --> 25:39.580
The child...

25:40.080 --> 25:41.749
he did this to me.

25:42.374 --> 25:44.084
He made me do it.

25:44.793 --> 25:45.961
He made me!

25:46.044 --> 25:48.255
[children crying in distance]

25:54.178 --> 25:56.388
Tammy, Wanda, come on!

25:57.681 --> 26:00.601
Hey, Gar. Great party.
Thanks for raising the bar.

26:01.101 --> 26:03.854
Now all the kids are gonna want
a burning clown for their birthday.

26:04.980 --> 26:05.981
[buzzer sounds]

26:07.483 --> 26:11.528
- [Karl]<i> Yeah, who's there?</i>
- Oh, hi, it's Gary Bloom from the wedding.

26:11.612 --> 26:12.612
<i>Did you come alone?</i>

26:13.614 --> 26:15.866
- Yeah, I came alone.
<i>- Were you followed?</i>

26:17.659 --> 26:18.494
No.

26:18.577 --> 26:19.787
<i>Come on up. Third floor.</i>

26:20.204 --> 26:22.956
[buzzer sounds]

26:36.094 --> 26:37.429
[knocks on door]

26:39.807 --> 26:40.808
Hello?

26:43.352 --> 26:44.478
Hello?

26:46.855 --> 26:47.940
Karl?

26:53.654 --> 26:54.780
Hello?

26:58.492 --> 27:00.702
Huh. [gasps] Oh, my...

27:00.786 --> 27:04.123
Gary, thank you for coming.
I need you to see this.

27:08.585 --> 27:10.462
[inhales] Check out this shot right here.

27:12.172 --> 27:13.215
It's amazing, right?

27:13.882 --> 27:16.635
The way the sunlight bangs up
against the lens like that.

27:16.718 --> 27:21.306
Yeah. Sorry. W-Why is the camera, like,
swinging all over the place?

27:21.390 --> 27:24.560
Were you not able to afford a tripod
with the money we gave you?

27:24.643 --> 27:25.978
A tripod?

27:26.061 --> 27:27.229
- Yeah.
- [chuckles]

27:27.312 --> 27:31.441
Well, let me ask you something.
Did, uh, Scorsese ever use a tripod?

27:32.568 --> 27:34.820
Fellini? Cassavetes?

27:34.903 --> 27:38.073
I don't know. This isn't<i> Goodfellas,</i>
this is our wedding video.

27:38.156 --> 27:40.117
Jeez. Thank you very much, Leonard Maltin,

27:40.200 --> 27:43.120
your review will be taken
into very serious consideration.

27:43.203 --> 27:45.038
[chuckles] I gotta ask you something.

27:45.122 --> 27:49.668
Did your film win "Best Short Doc"
at the Orinda Film Festival last year?

27:49.751 --> 27:50.919
- My...
- Did it?

27:51.628 --> 27:53.422
- No.
- Because mine did.

27:53.505 --> 27:55.632
- Okay.
- That's correct.

27:55.716 --> 27:58.260
Anyway, I think we have
bigger fish to fry here

27:58.343 --> 28:01.763
than your apparent lack of knowledge
about cinema.

28:02.139 --> 28:04.474
- Don't you?
- Sure.

28:04.558 --> 28:07.769
See, I thought that it was strange
when the preacher at your wedding

28:07.853 --> 28:09.229
started speaking in tongues.

28:09.313 --> 28:10.689
Oh, sorry, no. That was Latin.

28:10.772 --> 28:12.524
No, no, no. I thought it was Latin, too,

28:12.608 --> 28:15.027
because I have a keen ear for language
as a filmmaker,

28:15.110 --> 28:18.447
but I put those words
into Google Translations, and nothing.

28:18.530 --> 28:19.448
What?

28:19.531 --> 28:22.618
No known language. And that's Google, man.

28:23.535 --> 28:26.413
You have to listen.
Listen carefully. Open your ears.

28:26.496 --> 28:27.748
It does not sound like Latin.

28:28.624 --> 28:31.251
<i>[speaks gibberish]</i>

28:31.335 --> 28:32.878
So, I slowed down the footage.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.463
[slowed down, speaks gibberish]

28:34.546 --> 28:36.131
And I played it in reverse.

28:36.214 --> 28:39.343
[distorted]
<i>Do you vow to protect the child</i>

28:39.426 --> 28:43.263
<i>- come hellfire or brimstone?</i>
- [clicks]

28:45.515 --> 28:48.393
Okay, why are you playing
my wedding video in reverse?

28:48.477 --> 28:53.398
I think the more important question here
is why is the preacher at your wedding

28:53.482 --> 28:57.319
asking you to vow
to protect the child in reverse?

28:57.402 --> 28:58.904
Yeah, that's a little odd, too.

28:58.987 --> 29:00.614
You bet your ass it's odd.

29:01.615 --> 29:05.535
When the tornado struck at your wedding,
I thought that was really rotten luck,

29:05.619 --> 29:07.746
but the more I thought about it,
the more I realized,

29:07.829 --> 29:09.831
it wasn't chance that ruined your wedding.

29:09.915 --> 29:11.792
[screaming on video]

29:11.875 --> 29:15.712
- It was Satan.
- Okay, um, I think I'm gonna get...

29:15.796 --> 29:18.799
No, no, no, no! Gary, hold on!
Wait! Wait! Just watch, watch this!

29:19.091 --> 29:20.091
Watch, watch.

29:20.634 --> 29:22.386
<i>Run! Run for your lives!</i>

29:22.469 --> 29:25.305
Oh, my God, Uncle Scott.
I didn't even know he made it.

29:25.389 --> 29:28.183
[screaming on video]

29:28.267 --> 29:29.393
Oh.

29:29.476 --> 29:30.936
No, no, pay him no mind.

29:31.603 --> 29:35.524
What you need to be paying attention to
is right there in the background.

29:36.400 --> 29:40.862
Those winds were hitting
at 150 miles per hour,

29:42.239 --> 29:45.909
yet not one hair on his head is moving.

29:47.869 --> 29:48.954
Why?

29:50.789 --> 29:54.167
He's wearing a lot of hair gel?

29:54.251 --> 29:59.965
There's a barn being ripped to shreds
directly behind him in frame,

30:00.757 --> 30:02.175
and look at him.

30:03.343 --> 30:04.970
That is not normal.

30:06.596 --> 30:08.640
Does that seem normal to you?

30:10.225 --> 30:11.977
I did some research,

30:12.060 --> 30:14.813
because I fucking love researching things.

30:19.401 --> 30:20.401
Here it is.

30:21.028 --> 30:26.283
There is a religious group,
or a doomsday cult, what have you.

30:26.366 --> 30:30.120
They believe
a child will rise up from hell,

30:30.203 --> 30:33.915
to rule mankind, and to bring on
the end of the world as we know it.

30:35.709 --> 30:37.210
I think we found that child.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.549
He has risen from the bowels of hell.

30:43.925 --> 30:44.925
And now...

30:46.553 --> 30:48.055
you're his stepdad.

30:51.058 --> 30:52.058
You...

30:52.851 --> 30:53.727
I know.

30:53.810 --> 30:55.520
You need to...

30:57.022 --> 30:58.565
to use your tripod.

30:58.648 --> 31:01.068
No. It's fucking cinema verité, man!

31:01.151 --> 31:03.236
- I think we're gonna pass.
- No, no! Wait, wait!

31:03.320 --> 31:05.238
Everyone your wife ever dated is dead!

31:06.782 --> 31:08.033
Look at this. Look, look.

31:08.658 --> 31:10.160
A lightning strike?

31:10.827 --> 31:13.497
A heart attack at 32?

31:15.332 --> 31:17.417
A freak mulching accident.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.420
Wait, what did you just say?

31:21.713 --> 31:23.423
They're all dead. All of them.

31:25.092 --> 31:26.259
All except for one.

31:30.806 --> 31:32.599
Gabriel Winthorp.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.062
I found his address on the Internet.

31:38.480 --> 31:39.480
Okay.

31:40.565 --> 31:42.692
We need to go talk to him.

31:47.155 --> 31:49.950
You think about it, Gary.
You call me when you come to your senses.

31:50.826 --> 31:54.287
I have all the equipment all read...
We can use the tripod, Gar!

31:56.415 --> 31:57.666
[keys clatter]

32:04.673 --> 32:05.966
[sighs]

32:07.551 --> 32:08.427
[gasps] Hey!

32:08.510 --> 32:09.678
[exhales]

32:09.761 --> 32:11.221
Hey, buddy, what's up?

32:11.972 --> 32:16.309
What are... What are you doing?
Y-You just... Coloring in the dark there?

32:16.393 --> 32:17.436
Cool.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.195
Isn't it, uh...

32:28.488 --> 32:29.698
past your bedtime?

32:37.164 --> 32:39.374
You want me to turn off the light, or...

32:46.256 --> 32:49.134
[Samantha] Yeah. Thank you.
Thank you so much, Wendy.

32:49.217 --> 32:50.469
I really appreciate it.

32:50.552 --> 32:51.678
Okay.

32:51.761 --> 32:53.096
I know. I know.

32:53.180 --> 32:56.308
I hope Jeremy's nightmares
aren't too bad tonight, too.

32:59.227 --> 33:01.438
Okay. I know. Yeah, okay.

33:01.938 --> 33:03.899
I'll see you then. Bye-bye.

33:06.193 --> 33:07.861
Child Protective Services called.

33:07.944 --> 33:08.820
What?

33:08.904 --> 33:11.323
Apparently, they had calls from parents

33:11.406 --> 33:13.617
saying that we had a dangerous clown
at our party.

33:13.700 --> 33:16.661
Their children are gonna be
in therapy for the rest of their lives.

33:16.745 --> 33:20.582
- Gary, where did you find that clown?
- On the internet. I don't know.

33:20.665 --> 33:24.252
Sweetie, you can't just pick any clown
off the internet.

33:24.336 --> 33:25.504
You're a parent now.

33:25.587 --> 33:28.673
You have to hope for the best,
but you prepare for the worst.

33:28.757 --> 33:32.344
[exhales] That's a good point, hon.
I'm gonna stick to that from now on.

33:33.470 --> 33:35.555
- Oh, man.
- They're sending someone here.

33:36.765 --> 33:37.807
Tomorrow.

33:38.350 --> 33:41.269
Wendy said she would come,
and she would help support.

33:41.353 --> 33:44.689
But, Gary, you need to be there too, okay?

33:44.773 --> 33:45.773
[exhales]

33:46.149 --> 33:48.777
- Sweetie?
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be there.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.445
Really, Gary?

33:51.696 --> 33:52.822
Yeah.

33:54.574 --> 33:56.034
I will be there.

34:01.873 --> 34:05.085
You know, today I met with
our wedding videographer.

34:05.168 --> 34:07.963
Mm... God, I thought we agreed
we weren't gonna relive that.

34:08.046 --> 34:11.508
Yeah, no, I know, but...
I wanted to see if we could salvage it.

34:11.591 --> 34:13.843
- And?
- We can't.

34:17.347 --> 34:21.268
Okay, do you remember the preacher
when he started speaking Latin?

34:21.351 --> 34:23.228
Mm, such a romantic language.

34:23.311 --> 34:26.231
Yeah, well, as it turns out,
he wasn't speaking Latin,

34:26.314 --> 34:29.776
he was speaking in English...
backwards.

34:31.861 --> 34:33.905
[laughs]

34:33.989 --> 34:36.324
Okay, Gar. W-What was he saying?

34:36.408 --> 34:41.413
He made me vow to protect the child
come hellfire or brimstone.

34:41.496 --> 34:44.165
- I'm serious, Sam.
- Well, at least he made a good point.

34:44.249 --> 34:47.335
In reverse.
Why would he make his point in reverse?

34:47.419 --> 34:52.382
I don't know, Gary. I'm sure people
make points in reverse all the time.

34:53.133 --> 34:54.426
I'm pretty sure they don't.

34:55.927 --> 34:59.306
I mean, maybe Ozzy Osbourne,
but that's it.

35:07.480 --> 35:10.817
So, Gar, w-what are you saying?

35:10.900 --> 35:12.736
I don't know. I'm just sort of...

35:15.864 --> 35:17.032
[exhales]

35:17.741 --> 35:21.828
Look, I'm wondering again
about Lucas' biological father.

35:21.911 --> 35:24.748
What does that have to do with anything?
You're his father now.

35:24.831 --> 35:26.041
Well, yeah...

35:26.124 --> 35:28.251
I told you parenting would be hard, and...

35:28.918 --> 35:31.546
- you said you were up for it.
- I did. I did say that.

35:31.630 --> 35:34.299
See, so you just need
to take all this stress

35:34.382 --> 35:37.844
and crumple it in a little ball
and throw it away.

35:37.927 --> 35:40.388
- Maybe you're right.
- Of course, I'm right.

35:41.598 --> 35:45.352
I mean, why don't you
just get out of these?

35:45.435 --> 35:47.354
And I will give you a massage,

35:48.355 --> 35:49.939
and I will take it from there.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.192
Shouldn't we put Lucas to bed?

35:53.234 --> 35:54.986
I tucked him in an hour ago.

36:02.077 --> 36:04.079
[Gary] Oh, man, that feels so good.

36:04.162 --> 36:05.538
[Samantha] Mmm.

36:06.373 --> 36:09.876
Baby, listen, I know that
we're an unconventional family.

36:09.959 --> 36:12.170
I mean, we're not totally normal.

36:14.005 --> 36:19.844
And the way Lucas was conceived
wasn't exactly ideal.

36:21.137 --> 36:22.931
But at least we're together, right?

36:23.890 --> 36:25.392
Yeah, yeah.

36:25.475 --> 36:27.102
I agree 100%.

36:27.644 --> 36:31.981
Hey, r-remind me again
how Lucas was conceived.

36:32.065 --> 36:34.776
- Promise you won't judge?
- No, of course not.

36:34.859 --> 36:37.362
Oh, man, that's the spot right there.

36:37.445 --> 36:38.697
[Samantha] Okay.

36:38.780 --> 36:42.867
Well, you remember when I told you
about that crazy time in my 20s,

36:42.951 --> 36:47.038
where I dropped out of school,
and then I joined that sort of like...

36:47.622 --> 36:48.622
like cult.

36:49.290 --> 36:53.253
Uh, no, I don't think
you told me about that.

36:53.336 --> 36:57.090
Well, I guess they were pretty shocked
to find out that I was a virgin, still,

36:57.173 --> 37:00.510
and so, they threw
this huge ceremony for me,

37:00.593 --> 37:04.389
where they all got dressed up
in these long, flowy black robes,

37:04.472 --> 37:07.142
and they wore these elaborate masks.

37:07.642 --> 37:10.145
And there were all kinds of herbs.

37:10.645 --> 37:11.646
Lots of herbs.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.565
Okay...

37:13.648 --> 37:17.152
Anyway, they were chanting,
and then they put me in this star,

37:17.235 --> 37:22.073
and they covered me in this warm,
red body paint.

37:23.783 --> 37:24.617
And then?

37:24.701 --> 37:27.495
I... I don't really know. I...

37:28.455 --> 37:31.458
must have blacked out
'cause I had this terrible nightmare.

37:32.250 --> 37:38.381
But when I woke up,
I left, and I never looked back.

37:42.886 --> 37:44.721
What? Oh, do...

37:44.804 --> 37:46.973
- No...
- I told you it wasn't ideal.

37:47.056 --> 37:49.267
- You said you wouldn't judge!
- I'm not judging.

37:49.350 --> 37:52.020
I'm just saying maybe this is
the sort of thing we'd talk about

37:52.103 --> 37:53.605
before we get married.

37:53.688 --> 37:57.108
I was young,
and maybe I was a little naive, right?

37:57.859 --> 38:02.447
But, Gar, I wouldn't change anything
even if I could because now I have...

38:02.530 --> 38:03.530
[floor creaks]

38:03.990 --> 38:06.326
Lucas! Hi, honey.

38:06.409 --> 38:09.412
- Hey, buddy.
- Are you okay, honey?

38:10.205 --> 38:14.667
Are you still upset
about that clown Gary hired? Yeah?

38:14.751 --> 38:16.419
You want to sleep with us tonight?

38:17.337 --> 38:20.965
Um, don't you think...
Never mind. Come on in, buddy.

38:22.842 --> 38:24.344
Let's have a sleepover.

38:28.640 --> 38:30.308
All right, snuggle up.

38:31.601 --> 38:34.771
Get cozy.
And no burning clowns in your dreams.

38:34.854 --> 38:35.939
[kisses]

38:36.481 --> 38:37.816
[Samantha sighs]

38:38.650 --> 38:40.068
Tomorrow's a new day.

38:48.535 --> 38:51.329
[Lucas mumbling]

38:54.499 --> 38:56.960
[grunting]

39:22.819 --> 39:23.819
[gasps]

39:44.549 --> 39:46.759
[screams]

39:47.343 --> 39:49.804
[gasping]

39:57.812 --> 39:59.981
She said he was conceived
out of a nightmare

40:00.064 --> 40:01.900
during some satanic cult ritual.

40:01.983 --> 40:04.694
She was young and needed the money.
Doesn't mean anything.

40:04.777 --> 40:06.696
What about the clown?
You think that was normal?

40:06.779 --> 40:09.741
No, no, that was definitely
an unusual clown.

40:09.824 --> 40:11.784
Okay, well, this is gonna sound nuts,

40:11.868 --> 40:16.664
but I think there's a chance that maybe
he caused the tornado at my wedding.

40:16.748 --> 40:18.958
- Who, the clown?
- No, dude. Lucas.

40:19.042 --> 40:20.668
[chuckles] Yeah, right.

40:20.752 --> 40:24.047
Yeah, that freaky little kid definitely
caused a tornado at the party.

40:24.130 --> 40:27.550
Al, listen to me. I had worms
coming out of my nose last night.

40:27.634 --> 40:31.137
Jesus! That's, like,
a serious hygiene issue, man.

40:31.220 --> 40:34.307
- Maybe it was a dream.
- Still, you should get that looked at.

40:34.390 --> 40:35.934
This must be it.

40:39.228 --> 40:41.314
Are you sure you want to do this, man?

40:41.397 --> 40:43.483
I hate meeting my wife's exes.

40:43.566 --> 40:45.818
[praying]

40:59.916 --> 41:00.916
Hey.

41:01.793 --> 41:02.919
Hey, yo. Excuse me.

41:03.628 --> 41:05.088
- Hey.
- Hi.

41:06.005 --> 41:10.635
She has begun to cry tears of blood.

41:12.011 --> 41:13.221
Is that right?

41:14.347 --> 41:17.600
We're looking for a guy named Gabriel.
Do you know him?

41:19.477 --> 41:21.562
Gabriel cannot be disturbed.

41:22.522 --> 41:23.940
Okay, well...

41:24.482 --> 41:25.942
He used to know my wife.

41:26.025 --> 41:28.277
I just have a few questions for him,

41:28.361 --> 41:31.030
mostly about my weird
little stepson Lucas.

41:32.699 --> 41:35.952
Follow me. Speak no words.

41:36.619 --> 41:37.829
- Okay.
- No problem.

41:40.373 --> 41:41.749
- [whip cracking]
- [man screaming]

41:49.090 --> 41:51.009
- [whipping]
- [screaming]

41:54.971 --> 41:57.223
- [whips]
- [screams]

41:59.183 --> 42:00.768
- [screams]
- Gabriel!

42:01.853 --> 42:03.688
You have guests.

42:07.316 --> 42:08.401
Um...

42:11.821 --> 42:14.699
Hey. Hi, I'm Gary.

42:14.782 --> 42:17.160
Um... This is my friend, Al.

42:17.243 --> 42:21.748
And, uh, you know,
we're, well, we're stepdads.

42:21.831 --> 42:22.832
Get to the point.

42:22.915 --> 42:24.250
Okay. Uh...

42:25.084 --> 42:28.921
I think maybe you used to know, um...

42:29.005 --> 42:31.591
my wife Samantha
and my little stepson Lucas.

42:31.674 --> 42:34.927
God forgive me for I have sinned!

42:35.011 --> 42:37.513
- [screams]
- Would you stop with the flagellating?

42:37.597 --> 42:39.157
This is why I'm happy we're in therapy.

42:39.223 --> 42:41.642
This is what happens
when you don't talk stuff out.

42:41.726 --> 42:43.436
The end is near.

42:43.519 --> 42:46.606
Oh, Lord, please do not blame me
for what cannot be stopped!

42:46.689 --> 42:48.441
I think maybe we should just go.

42:48.524 --> 42:51.944
You must travel to the old marketplace
in the city of Bethlehem.

42:52.028 --> 42:55.031
Seek out the demon hunter Gozamel.

42:55.114 --> 42:56.532
Only he can help you now.

42:56.616 --> 42:57.617
Bethlehem?

42:57.700 --> 43:01.454
"And they that dwell upon the Earth
did wonder seeing the beast,

43:01.537 --> 43:04.040
that it was a thing,

43:04.624 --> 43:07.335
and is not, and yet now is!"

43:08.127 --> 43:09.629
I'm not following...

43:09.712 --> 43:11.964
Revelation, chapter 17.

43:13.508 --> 43:14.801
The child.

43:15.927 --> 43:17.512
He is the Antichrist!

43:19.013 --> 43:20.223
Okay.

43:21.724 --> 43:23.101
Okay, thanks.

43:23.684 --> 43:28.272
And, uh, thank you for welcoming us
into your beautiful home.

43:28.898 --> 43:31.317
And, uh, we're gonna let you get back
to your stuff...

43:32.276 --> 43:33.319
you know.

43:34.612 --> 43:35.655
Let's go.

43:35.988 --> 43:37.657
[whipping, screaming continue]

43:41.869 --> 43:45.206
I gotta tell you, man, I'm feeling
so much better about Jeremy right now.

43:45.289 --> 43:48.459
He's a spoiled little shit, but at least
he's not the fucking Antichrist.

43:49.544 --> 43:50.545
Seriously?

43:51.295 --> 43:52.295
Seriously.

43:55.174 --> 43:56.551
- [coughs]
- [groans]

43:56.634 --> 43:59.554
Wasn't there, like, a sign
or anything when you were dating?

43:59.637 --> 44:02.014
No, I mean, it all moved so fast.

44:02.098 --> 44:04.267
I figured he'd warm up to me
at some point.

44:04.350 --> 44:07.937
You must have had some indication
that kid is, like, pure fucking evil?

44:08.020 --> 44:09.772
Yeah, Al, all the time.

44:09.856 --> 44:12.733
But you told me that was normal,
that all kids are dicks.

44:12.817 --> 44:15.903
That's true, kids are dicks, man.
But this is a different level.

44:15.987 --> 44:18.197
He's like top of the dick chain, bro.

44:18.281 --> 44:20.283
- [man on TV]<i> Breaking news...</i>
- Two more, please.

44:20.366 --> 44:23.369
<i>- Jane Hernandez is on scene where...</i>
- You could get a divorce.

44:23.452 --> 44:25.955
No, I don't want a divorce, Al.

44:26.038 --> 44:28.666
Okay? Samantha's perfect.
She's everything I ever wanted.

44:28.749 --> 44:30.668
She comes with some hefty baggage.

44:30.751 --> 44:33.212
- Al, it is not an option!
- Okay.

44:33.296 --> 44:35.047
[woman on TV]
<i>Wanda, what do you see there?</i>

44:36.424 --> 44:39.969

- That's the guy that bought the nunnery.
<i>- When is the end actually coming?</i>

44:47.185 --> 44:51.147
Hey, I think maybe
we should go find this guy Gozamel.

44:51.439 --> 44:53.107
Maybe he could help us out.

44:54.066 --> 44:57.945
Look, I don't know if I told you this,
but I'm coaching Jeremy's baseball team,

44:58.029 --> 45:01.407
so for me getting to Bethlehem, Israel,
is a little out of the question.

45:01.490 --> 45:03.409
- Just right now is not a good time.
- I get it.

45:03.492 --> 45:05.161
- Not a good time.
<i>- There you have it.</i>

45:05.244 --> 45:09.373

45:16.005 --> 45:17.798
[chattering]

45:20.009 --> 45:23.804
Excuse me.
Um, we're looking for a guy named Gozamel.

45:23.888 --> 45:25.973
- He's busy.
- Oh, that's great. He's here.

45:26.057 --> 45:29.268
- Um, we really need to see him.
- Yeah, we're on a mission from God.

45:31.145 --> 45:34.231
Gozamel to cashier. Gozamel to cashier.

45:34.315 --> 45:37.526
[rock music playing]

45:41.364 --> 45:42.990
Um, Gozamel?

45:44.450 --> 45:46.577
I'm Gozamel. You guys were looking for me?

45:48.245 --> 45:51.165
So, what makes you think your stepson
is the spawn of Satan?

45:51.248 --> 45:54.502
- Well, he's just this really weird kid.
- [Al] Super weird, dude.

45:54.585 --> 45:58.130
And he has these beady little eyes that,
like, bore into your soul.

45:58.214 --> 45:59.382
Very beady little eyes.

45:59.465 --> 46:01.884
He manipulates people into doing stuff
they don't want to do.

46:01.968 --> 46:04.261
Jumping out of buildings,
lighting themselves on fire...

46:04.345 --> 46:05.763
And talking backwards.

46:05.846 --> 46:08.057
Sounds like
your average devil child to me.

46:08.140 --> 46:09.725
[woman] This is me.

46:10.184 --> 46:12.478
- When's his birthday?
- We just had his birthday party.

46:12.561 --> 46:14.563
But his real birthday
is the sixth of June.

46:14.647 --> 46:17.024
- How old is he turning?
- Six.

46:18.943 --> 46:21.612
Oh, shit, it's him. It's him!

46:22.154 --> 46:24.075
- [grunts] No, I've got it.
- You want some help?

46:26.033 --> 46:27.201
[grunts]

46:27.284 --> 46:29.324
- Oh, that's not...
- You're gonna crush those buns!

46:29.370 --> 46:30.371
I got it!

46:30.454 --> 46:31.664
- [grunts]
- Whoa!

46:31.747 --> 46:34.208
- [woman] Thank you so much, young man.
- Let's go!

46:34.291 --> 46:36.585
But, hold on, we drove.

46:36.669 --> 46:40.339
It's the end of the world!
We'll drop you off afterwards. Come on!

46:40.423 --> 46:42.383
I'm good with that. Come on, buddy!

46:42.466 --> 46:44.635
- Well...
- Let's go save the world, man!

46:44.719 --> 46:45.720
Whoo!

46:45.803 --> 46:46.971
[starts engine]

46:49.098 --> 46:50.891
[tires screeching]

46:58.190 --> 47:00.651
[Gozamel] I have been
prepping for this my entire life!

47:00.735 --> 47:03.612
- That's great news, man!
- We're really glad we found you.

47:03.696 --> 47:06.615
Thanks. I got some donuts and beer
in the cooler if you guys want.

47:06.699 --> 47:07.950
- No way!
- Yeah.

47:08.034 --> 47:09.535
Score!

47:09.618 --> 47:11.829
- Gozamel, you're the best, my brother.
- Thank you.

47:11.912 --> 47:13.789
- Is there a seat belt back here?
- Seat belt?

47:13.873 --> 47:16.584
You don't need a fucking seat belt.
This is the end of the world!

47:16.667 --> 47:18.210
- There are no rules!
- No rules.

47:18.294 --> 47:20.004
I'd still like to have a seat belt.

47:20.087 --> 47:23.340
[Gozamel] When I was a kid,
my father told me I have a destiny.

47:23.424 --> 47:25.843
And my destiny was to save the world.

47:25.926 --> 47:29.180
- That must have been a pretty heavy talk.
- Fuck yeah, it was heavy, man.

47:29.263 --> 47:31.015
'Cause he was dying in my arms.

47:31.098 --> 47:33.684
But then he bequeathed onto me
the knife of destiny.

47:34.393 --> 47:37.980
And he told me, "You take that little
Antichrist fuck-up to hallowed ground,

47:38.064 --> 47:40.358
- and you stab him right in the chest!"
- I'm sorry, what?

47:40.441 --> 47:43.069
But you gotta do it by 6:00 p.m.
on June the sixth.

47:43.778 --> 47:46.258
Man, I was getting worried.
I didn't think it was gonna happen.

47:46.322 --> 47:49.784
- No. What did you say about a knife?
- The knife of destiny.

47:49.867 --> 47:52.661
It's in the little chest of drawers
I built in on the side.

47:52.745 --> 47:54.997
I wanted to make sure
it was next to me at all times.

47:55.790 --> 47:56.790
Hmm?

47:56.832 --> 47:59.752
Yeah, that's it.
That knife will kill anybody.

47:59.835 --> 48:02.671
No, we are not stabbing my stepson
in the chest!

48:02.755 --> 48:05.549
Yeah, his wife's already pretty upset.
They're not getting along.

48:05.633 --> 48:06.926
That's not gonna help.

48:07.009 --> 48:10.638
We'll burn him alive or drown him,
as long as it's on hallowed ground.

48:10.721 --> 48:13.974
What?
No, we're not doing any of those things!

48:14.058 --> 48:16.143
Did you think
I was gonna play footsie with him?

48:16.227 --> 48:20.731
- I don't know. Exorcise him? I...
- You can't exorcise the Antichrist, bro.

48:20.815 --> 48:22.858
Let's sacrifice a goat.
Something like that.

48:22.942 --> 48:25.528
- Yeah, a goat.
- Why hurt an innocent goat?

48:25.611 --> 48:27.238
I'm just brainstorming.

48:27.780 --> 48:33.035
All right, well, there is this myth
about someone called the Keymaster,

48:33.119 --> 48:35.329
that he could save the world
without killing the kid.

48:35.412 --> 48:38.541
Way to bury the lead, man.
Yeah, let's go find the Keymaster.

48:38.624 --> 48:40.334
[Gozamel laughing]

48:40.417 --> 48:43.170
There's no fucking keymaster!

48:43.254 --> 48:44.421
I made it up.

48:44.505 --> 48:46.298
From<i> Ghostbusters,</i> remember?

48:46.382 --> 48:49.385
- Here. Hand me that thing.
<i>- Ghostbusters.</i> You didn't make it up.

48:49.468 --> 48:50.553
Don't worry, guys.

48:50.636 --> 48:52.888
I've been prepping for this
my entire life.

48:52.972 --> 48:55.012
- There's nothing that can happen...
- No, look out!

48:55.057 --> 48:58.769
- [tires screech]
- [crashes]

49:12.575 --> 49:13.617
Holy crap.

49:14.410 --> 49:17.163
- You okay?
- Yeah, I think I'm all right.

49:17.705 --> 49:19.707
It's a good thing you were wearing
your seat belt.

49:21.083 --> 49:23.419
Holy shit!

49:23.669 --> 49:26.547
- [Gary stammers] Gozamel?
- [Al] Gozer?

49:26.630 --> 49:27.630
[Gary] Gozamel?

49:27.673 --> 49:30.217
[Al] Gozer, you little demon hunter,
where you at, boy?

49:30.301 --> 49:31.677
Gozamel?

49:32.720 --> 49:33.888
Over here!

49:37.558 --> 49:38.934
[Gary] Oh, shit!

49:40.269 --> 49:42.479
Oh, shit...

49:44.648 --> 49:46.567
I'm sorry I let you down.

49:47.359 --> 49:49.278
I'm sorry I let you down, Daddy!

49:49.361 --> 49:52.406
Buddy, you didn't let your dad down, man.

49:52.865 --> 49:54.825
You... you're the stepfather.

49:56.619 --> 50:00.706
His destiny is in your hands now.

50:01.790 --> 50:04.126
When the time is nigh,

50:05.085 --> 50:07.922
you'll get a sign from above.

50:09.506 --> 50:14.803
Look... for... the... sign.

50:14.887 --> 50:15.930
[Al] Gozer?

50:17.097 --> 50:18.390
- [exhales]
- Gozer?

50:19.433 --> 50:20.559
Gozer, buddy?

50:21.727 --> 50:25.189
God! I told you we should have
fucking caravanned!

50:25.272 --> 50:28.442
- Okay, that might have been a better idea.
- God, this is crazy.

50:28.525 --> 50:30.236
Oh, my God, this is so crazy.

50:30.319 --> 50:33.030
- Dude, bro, you gotta relax, man.
- How can I relax?

50:33.113 --> 50:34.573
- We're in a cornfield!
- So?

50:34.657 --> 50:37.409
What good thing has ever happened
in a cornfield, Al?

50:37.493 --> 50:40.371
Well, I don't know.
<i>Field of Dreams</i> is pretty cool.

50:43.749 --> 50:46.126
Okay. All right, all right.

50:46.210 --> 50:49.338
All right, we're not that far.
We can... We can walk home.

50:50.714 --> 50:53.217
[Al] Well, are we just gonna
leave him here?

50:53.300 --> 50:54.551
Oh, fuck.

50:55.010 --> 50:57.012
Give me the knife. Give me the knife.

50:57.096 --> 50:58.389
I'm coming, bro!

50:59.181 --> 51:03.185
All I wanted was to get married
and be happy.

51:03.269 --> 51:06.146
- Have a normal life.
- Nobody has a normal life, man.

51:06.230 --> 51:09.650
No, I know, but, like,
in the realm of normal.

51:09.733 --> 51:11.694
There's... There's a realm.

51:11.777 --> 51:15.155
So, your stepkid's a little evil.
It's not like it's the end of the world.

51:15.239 --> 51:18.450
Okay, maybe in this case, it actually is,
but I'm a stepdad, too.

51:18.909 --> 51:19.785
You know what that means?

51:19.868 --> 51:22.788
I would never leave you
on the battlefield. I wouldn't do it!

51:22.871 --> 51:26.583
[Gary] You know, can we just try
walking in silence rest of the way?

51:26.667 --> 51:28.794
[Al] Yeah, man, no problem.
Was I talking too much?

51:28.877 --> 51:30.337
Total silence. No problem.

51:31.088 --> 51:32.673
[Gary] House is right up here.

51:33.424 --> 51:35.551
We made it. I'm home.

51:35.634 --> 51:38.595
- You're home. Jiggity jig.
- Shit.

51:38.679 --> 51:41.724
[swing creaking]

51:41.807 --> 51:43.976
- That's not him, is it?
- Yeah.

51:44.560 --> 51:46.145
He loves to swing.

51:47.021 --> 51:48.022
Okay.

51:49.440 --> 51:51.859
All right, little brother.
I gotta get out of here.

51:51.942 --> 51:54.153
I'll catch you at work tomorrow,
all right? Cool.

51:54.236 --> 51:57.698
Wait. What happened to not leaving
a soldier on the battlefield?

51:57.781 --> 51:59.533
I'm not leaving you, man.

51:59.617 --> 52:01.493
I'm not leaving you, like, forever.

52:02.161 --> 52:05.247
But right now, it's getting kinda late.
It's past my bedtime.

52:05.331 --> 52:07.875
I gotta get my snoozies in
'cause I get real fucking cranky.

52:07.958 --> 52:10.627
You don't want to see me cranky,
do you, man? Take this.

52:11.253 --> 52:14.048
- Take it! Take it!
- What the hell am I gonna do with this?

52:14.131 --> 52:15.632
- I don't know.
- He's just a kid.

52:15.716 --> 52:18.927
- You're a fucking warrior! I've got to go.
- What...

52:19.011 --> 52:21.847
I gotta do crosswalk duty
in the morning, man. I gotta go!

52:21.930 --> 52:22.930
Al!

52:29.772 --> 52:31.899
[breathes shakily]

52:31.982 --> 52:32.982
Oh, fuck.

52:33.525 --> 52:34.525
Oh, shit.

52:38.530 --> 52:41.575
[Samantha] You know, Gary really is
just the kindest man.

52:41.658 --> 52:43.660
He is so good to us.

52:44.203 --> 52:47.623
He hasn't totally got
the parenting thing... Gary!

52:47.706 --> 52:50.417
- Yeah?
- Gary! Hi. Come in, please.

52:50.501 --> 52:53.087
- You remember Wendy, from the party?
- Of course. Hello.

52:53.170 --> 52:56.882
And this is Mrs. Shaylock
from Child Protective Services.

52:57.508 --> 52:59.176
- Oh, hi. Hello.
- Hello.

52:59.259 --> 53:01.279
- Very nice to meet you. Yes.
- So nice to meet you.

53:01.303 --> 53:04.598
I am so sorry for being late.
I was racing home from work.

53:05.808 --> 53:09.103
- You work in a cornfield? [laughs]
- [nervously] No.

53:09.186 --> 53:10.896
- No.
- No.

53:10.979 --> 53:12.606
- I'm in real estate. And I...
- Oh.

53:13.816 --> 53:17.528
Go walking in cornfields at night,
sometimes to gather my thoughts.

53:17.611 --> 53:21.073
Well, then I would love for you
to share them with us right now.

53:21.156 --> 53:23.742
- Mr. Bloom, please have a seat. Come on.
- Okay.

53:23.826 --> 53:25.411
Can I just... I'm sorry.

53:25.494 --> 53:29.832
I was just telling Miss Shaylock
how you are trying...

53:29.915 --> 53:30.999
- Gary?
- Yeah?

53:31.083 --> 53:35.295
How you are trying so hard
to reach out to Lucas.

53:35.379 --> 53:38.841
That's right. Yeah, yeah.
I'm... I am trying.

53:38.924 --> 53:41.343
It's always so hard for stepdads.

53:41.427 --> 53:44.096
Tell me, Mr. Bloom, all the things

53:44.179 --> 53:46.473
that you do with the dear boy.

53:47.099 --> 53:49.810
Uh, w-well, I've taken him to school...

53:49.893 --> 53:51.562
- School.
- And...

53:52.521 --> 53:55.774
I've tried talking to him a bunch
of times. You know?

53:55.858 --> 53:58.569
Gary helped plan Lucas' birthday party.

53:58.652 --> 54:01.738
The one with the burning clown
that traumatized all the children?

54:01.822 --> 54:03.023
Lucas really looks up to Gary.

54:03.073 --> 54:06.285
I mean, just tonight, he told me
that he didn't want to go to sleep

54:06.368 --> 54:08.162
until Gary tucked him in.

54:08.245 --> 54:10.164
But I just saw him outside on the swing.

54:10.247 --> 54:13.333
Gary, don't be silly.
He is upstairs in his bedroom.

54:13.417 --> 54:14.918
It was the sweetest thing.

54:15.002 --> 54:17.880
He said in his little angel voice,
"Can Daddy please tuck me in?"

54:17.963 --> 54:19.757
- He called him "Daddy."
- What an angel.

54:19.840 --> 54:21.592
Yeah, a fallen...

54:21.675 --> 54:25.262
asleep angel, which I am way too bushed
to put down tonight.

54:25.345 --> 54:27.639
- Go tuck your son in.
- He's probably asleep.

54:27.723 --> 54:30.976
He's probably awake
and waiting up for you to tuck him in.

54:31.059 --> 54:32.269
- [snaps] Gary!
- All right.

54:36.648 --> 54:41.236
- "A little reluctant to tuck..."
- You don't need to write that down.

54:41.320 --> 54:42.988
I'll be the judge of that.

54:44.990 --> 54:46.116
All right.

54:52.539 --> 54:54.833
Hey, the lights are burned out up here.

54:54.917 --> 54:57.085
[Samantha]
There is a flashlight on the wall.

55:00.339 --> 55:02.216
This is fucking bullshit.

55:03.592 --> 55:04.676
All right.

55:05.761 --> 55:06.761
Here we go.

55:07.888 --> 55:11.266
He's a fucking five year old kid.
Nothing to be afraid of.

55:13.143 --> 55:14.394
Okay.

55:15.646 --> 55:16.730
All right.

55:16.813 --> 55:18.982
[breathes shakily]

55:19.066 --> 55:20.734
Shit.

55:21.693 --> 55:24.404
You marry a beautiful woman
and all hell breaks loose.

55:26.823 --> 55:27.950
All right.

55:41.255 --> 55:43.298
Hey, uh... hey, Lucas?

55:44.675 --> 55:46.260
You want me to tuck you in, buddy?

55:49.179 --> 55:51.056
Lucas, you in here?

55:53.642 --> 55:54.642
Jesus.

55:58.105 --> 55:59.231
Lucas?

56:06.655 --> 56:08.740
"Erutpar."

56:09.032 --> 56:12.077
<i>- </i>[roars] <i>I'm Remi the Lion. Wanna play?</i>

No, Remi, not right now.

56:21.712 --> 56:26.008
<i>- </i>[roars] <i>I'm Remi the Lion. Wanna play?</i>
- I told you, Remi, I don't wanna play.

56:26.758 --> 56:30.304
[roars] <i>I'm Remi the Lion. Wanna play?</i>

56:33.557 --> 56:34.725
Shut up.

56:34.808 --> 56:38.145
- [deep distorted voice]<i> You want to play?</i>
- [gasps]

56:40.856 --> 56:42.024
Samantha? Somebody?

56:42.107 --> 56:43.275
Somebody, help!

56:44.901 --> 56:49.156
- Why is it so hard for men?
- You have to demand more from him.

56:49.239 --> 56:50.532
[Gary] Samantha? Somebody?

56:51.116 --> 56:53.368
Try reading him a book, you sack of shit!

56:54.703 --> 56:55.787
[Gary] Shit.

56:56.288 --> 56:59.124
[grunts]

56:59.207 --> 57:00.751

- [gasps]

57:56.223 --> 57:57.349
[thuds]

58:08.610 --> 58:12.155
Let me tell you. Whatever a child
is going through emotionally,

58:12.239 --> 58:15.951
it's natural for them
to act out in physical ways.

58:16.034 --> 58:19.913
Please remember,
it is never the child's fault.

58:19.997 --> 58:23.083
No matter what happens,
it is never the child's fault.

58:27.004 --> 58:28.755
[thunder crashes]

58:35.053 --> 58:36.053
[grunts]

58:39.224 --> 58:41.601
It was very nice to meet you, Mrs. Bloom.

58:41.685 --> 58:45.397
Of course, you know, I'm going to keep
a very close eye on you and your family.

58:45.480 --> 58:49.067
- [chuckles] Of course. It's fine.
- Very nice to meet you, too...

58:49.151 --> 58:51.611
- Wendy.
- Wendy. Yes. You're parked in front of me.

58:51.695 --> 58:52.779
Oh, I'll be right out.

58:53.947 --> 58:54.948
- [raining]
- Oh!

58:59.453 --> 59:01.788
What was going on
with that idiot husband of yours?

59:01.872 --> 59:05.167
- No idea. I am so angry, I could scream.
- [phone ringing]

59:05.250 --> 59:09.004
Oh, it's him.
He must be too scared to come downstairs.

59:09.921 --> 59:13.091
- Wendy, thank you for your support.
- Of course. Anytime!

59:13.175 --> 59:16.595
I could not have done it without you.
Get that woman out of my driveway.

59:16.678 --> 59:18.764
- Happily.
- [phone ringing]

59:20.307 --> 59:22.517
Gary, what on earth are you doing?

59:22.601 --> 59:26.354
[breaking up]<i> Your evil, freaky,</i>
<i>little son buried me in the backyard!</i>

59:26.438 --> 59:27.731
Stop yelling, okay?

59:27.814 --> 59:31.193
- You know I can't understand you when...
<i>- Your evil fucking son...</i>

59:31.276 --> 59:32.402
[gasps]

59:32.986 --> 59:34.237

59:42.496 --> 59:43.663
Lucas?

59:44.331 --> 59:45.415
Honey?

59:48.126 --> 59:49.252
[chuckling exhale]

59:49.336 --> 59:50.712
So creative.

59:50.796 --> 59:52.756
[phone ringing]

59:52.839 --> 59:54.299
Gary? Where is Lucas?

59:54.382 --> 59:58.386
<i>Okay, I'm sorry that I yelled before.
I'm getting a little oxygen deprived.</i>

What? Where are you?

59:59.888 --> 1:00:01.098
<i>I'm in the backyard.</i>

1:00:01.181 --> 1:00:04.518
<i>Bring a shovel and come as fast as you can
or I'm gonna die!</i>

1:00:05.185 --> 1:00:06.478
[gasps]

1:00:06.561 --> 1:00:08.396
[panting]

1:00:12.359 --> 1:00:15.529
[grunts] Gary? Lucas?

1:00:17.405 --> 1:00:18.782
[thunder crashes]

1:00:19.950 --> 1:00:21.576
That's it!

1:00:21.660 --> 1:00:24.121
Time out, young man!

1:00:26.957 --> 1:00:28.041
[grunts]

1:00:30.836 --> 1:00:31.962
[grunts]

1:00:32.045 --> 1:00:34.005
[whimpering]

1:00:34.673 --> 1:00:37.592
Oh, my God, Gary!
Gary, say something! Are you okay?

1:00:37.676 --> 1:00:39.094
I...

1:00:39.177 --> 1:00:40.177
want...

1:00:40.595 --> 1:00:41.595
a divorce!

1:00:41.638 --> 1:00:43.348
Don't say that!

1:00:43.431 --> 1:00:44.933
Get out of there, Gary.

1:00:45.016 --> 1:00:46.893
Oh, can I? Thanks.

1:00:46.977 --> 1:00:49.396
- [pants]
- [Gary grunts]

1:00:49.479 --> 1:00:52.440
Gary, please don't overreact, okay?

1:00:52.524 --> 1:00:54.818
- I know he didn't mean to...
- He didn't mean to?

1:00:54.901 --> 1:00:56.945
He just wanted you to read him a book!

1:00:57.571 --> 1:00:59.948
I'm pretty sure that's not what he wanted.

1:01:00.031 --> 1:01:03.368
I should have insisted that you two spend
more time together before we got married.

1:01:03.451 --> 1:01:07.706
Oh, yeah, that would have been great,
getting to know him a little bit better.

1:01:07.789 --> 1:01:10.750
You've really outdone yourself, Gary.
Congratulations.

1:01:10.834 --> 1:01:13.670
- I've tried reaching out.
- Tried? You drove him to school.

1:01:13.753 --> 1:01:15.589
You've tried talking to him a few times.

1:01:15.672 --> 1:01:17.841
Excuse me if I didn't buy you
a dad of the year mug.

1:01:17.924 --> 1:01:19.509
He buried me alive, Sam!

1:01:19.593 --> 1:01:23.138
Children act out because they
don't know how to express their emotions.

1:01:23.221 --> 1:01:25.724
You're the adult.
You were supposed to help him.

1:01:25.807 --> 1:01:29.477
But you won't even want to look at my son,
because he's not yours!

1:01:29.561 --> 1:01:31.605
- That is not why.
- Then why?

1:01:31.688 --> 1:01:35.066
Because he's the fucking Antichrist, Sam!

1:01:35.150 --> 1:01:36.484
- That's why!
- [thunder crashes]

1:01:41.698 --> 1:01:43.992
- Listen to me.
- No.

1:01:44.075 --> 1:01:45.076
Sam!

1:01:48.038 --> 1:01:49.039
Come on, Lucas.

1:01:51.875 --> 1:01:52.875
Sam.

1:02:00.550 --> 1:02:02.052
Oh, great.

1:02:02.135 --> 1:02:04.346
Now it's raining blood, Sam!

1:02:04.429 --> 1:02:06.181
Not cool, Lucas!

1:02:06.264 --> 1:02:07.682
Not cool!

1:02:10.310 --> 1:02:12.604
Fundamentals! Fundamentals!

1:02:12.687 --> 1:02:17.192
It was awful.
Just the whole thing, indescribably awful.

1:02:17.275 --> 1:02:20.195
I know what you mean, man.
We all been there.

1:02:20.278 --> 1:02:21.321
No, you haven't.

1:02:21.404 --> 1:02:22.864
Come on, Jeremy. Eye on the ball.

1:02:23.531 --> 1:02:25.867
- [grunts]
- That's okay, buddy. There you go!

1:02:26.910 --> 1:02:30.622
Look, I hate to say it, man, but I think
you might actually have to kill the kid.

1:02:30.705 --> 1:02:32.207
[whispering] No, I can't do it.

1:02:32.290 --> 1:02:33.792
Gregory Peck did it in<i> The Omen.</i>

1:02:33.875 --> 1:02:36.378
No, he didn't.
He got shot before he could do it.

1:02:36.461 --> 1:02:39.965
And I'm pretty sure that everyone thought
he was an awful father after that.

1:02:40.048 --> 1:02:42.384
Well, they already think that
about you, so...

1:02:42.467 --> 1:02:44.719
- What? Who does? Who said that?
- Nobody.

1:02:45.553 --> 1:02:48.265
- Just my wife and all her friends.
- What?

1:02:48.348 --> 1:02:50.934
- The school board... [mutters]
- Okay. Okay. All right.

1:02:51.017 --> 1:02:54.562
I didn't want to tell you this,
'cause I didn't want you to get jealous.

1:02:55.647 --> 1:02:57.565
But I won the Dad ball this morning.

1:02:58.483 --> 1:03:00.068
- What?
- Isn't that awesome?

1:03:03.238 --> 1:03:06.074
Yeah. That's awesome.

1:03:06.157 --> 1:03:08.785
It made me realize
that there's a lot to live for.

1:03:08.868 --> 1:03:10.996
A lot of innocent people
are gonna go to hell.

1:03:11.079 --> 1:03:14.124
- I know, I know.
- Maybe not totally innocent, but people!

1:03:14.207 --> 1:03:15.875
- That's not cool!
- Okay. All right.

1:03:18.003 --> 1:03:20.547
You know, you don't have to make it
look like you did it.

1:03:20.630 --> 1:03:22.549
You could take him
to King Willie's Water Park.

1:03:22.966 --> 1:03:27.679
Get him some floaties, fill 'em with sand,
push him down that big-ass slide.

1:03:28.430 --> 1:03:31.224
Nature's gonna take its course.
That shit happens all the time.

1:03:31.308 --> 1:03:34.311
- That place is a safety hazard.
- It has to be on hallowed ground.

1:03:34.394 --> 1:03:38.315
I'm pretty sure that the water park
is hallowed ground. The pope blessed it.

1:03:38.398 --> 1:03:40.525
Sam's never gonna let me
near him again anyway.

1:03:40.608 --> 1:03:42.819
Go over there,
bring her some flowers, man.

1:03:43.361 --> 1:03:46.114
Tell her you're sorry
that you called her kid the Antichrist.

1:03:46.197 --> 1:03:49.576
I do that shit all the time.
Sometimes, he deserves it.

1:03:49.659 --> 1:03:51.411
Marsupials! [clapping]

1:04:05.050 --> 1:04:06.468
- Hey.
- Hey.

1:04:08.845 --> 1:04:12.724
I am... really sorry about what I said.

1:04:12.807 --> 1:04:15.352
You said some awful things. Awful things.

1:04:15.435 --> 1:04:17.812
I want to turn this around, Sam.
I really do.

1:04:17.896 --> 1:04:21.691
I want to be the man, the father,
that I know I can be.

1:04:22.275 --> 1:04:23.777
I know it's his birthday today,

1:04:23.860 --> 1:04:27.197
and I'd love if I could just have
a little father-son time with him.

1:04:27.280 --> 1:04:28.740
Maybe teach him to swim?

1:04:50.887 --> 1:04:53.139
Lucas doesn't know how to swim.

1:04:54.974 --> 1:04:58.686
Well, that's what we're here for, Reeroy,
to teach Lucas how to swim.

1:04:59.979 --> 1:05:01.648
Ready to go up that big one there?

1:05:03.942 --> 1:05:05.026
Okay, how about this?

1:05:05.110 --> 1:05:07.654
How about we, uh, go play around,
work up our courage?

1:05:07.737 --> 1:05:08.988
Sound good, Reeroy?

1:05:09.531 --> 1:05:12.492
All right. Don't worry, buddy.
We'll have a blast. Okay?

1:05:12.575 --> 1:05:13.952
Let's go.

1:05:14.828 --> 1:05:19.791

1:05:22.627 --> 1:05:27.757

Oh, I'm dodging. I'm dodging.
[chuckles] Oh! Oh! Oh!

1:05:52.240 --> 1:05:53.867
That's it! That's it!

1:05:54.868 --> 1:05:57.704
- I got you. Oh, I got you.
- [laughing]

1:05:57.787 --> 1:05:59.247
Oh, my God, are you laughing?

1:05:59.914 --> 1:06:01.958
I don't think
I've ever seen you laugh before.

1:06:07.589 --> 1:06:10.633
Aw, you and your son
look really cute together.

1:06:11.676 --> 1:06:13.946
- Do you want me to take a picture?
- No, that's all right.

1:06:13.970 --> 1:06:15.221
Really? It's no problem.

1:06:16.055 --> 1:06:17.515
- Sure. Yeah. Why not?
- [laughs]

1:06:18.141 --> 1:06:19.142
There you go.

1:06:20.435 --> 1:06:21.978
Okay, lean in a little closer.

1:06:23.354 --> 1:06:24.689
A little closer.

1:06:28.485 --> 1:06:29.527
Great.

1:06:30.195 --> 1:06:31.905
- There you go.
- Thanks.

1:06:45.793 --> 1:06:48.046
Lucas is ready for the big slide now.

1:06:49.005 --> 1:06:52.217
Are you sure? You know what?
We actually don't...

1:06:52.300 --> 1:06:53.343
[Lucas giggles]

1:07:15.532 --> 1:07:18.826
All right, listen, Lucas,
these are gonna help you float.

1:07:18.910 --> 1:07:19.827
Hurry it up!

1:07:19.911 --> 1:07:21.996
We're gonna be one minute.
It's his first time.

1:07:23.206 --> 1:07:26.125
I know these feel heavy, Lucas,
but once they hit the water,

1:07:26.209 --> 1:07:28.545
they're just gonna get much lighter, okay?

1:07:32.632 --> 1:07:33.632
Listen to me.

1:07:34.425 --> 1:07:35.593
You don't have to do this.

1:07:35.677 --> 1:07:38.179
- Come on already!
- I told you he's not ready!

1:07:38.263 --> 1:07:40.431
Do you understand? Oh!

1:07:40.515 --> 1:07:41.641
[Lucas] Whoa!

1:07:42.892 --> 1:07:44.352
Oh, no. Oh, my God.

1:07:44.435 --> 1:07:46.604
What the hell am I doing?
Oh, what the hell?

1:07:46.688 --> 1:07:48.314
God, I don't know if you're real.

1:07:48.398 --> 1:07:51.526
If you are, you probably hate me,
but you gotta give me a sign here.

1:07:51.609 --> 1:07:53.069
You gotta give me a sign.

1:07:53.152 --> 1:07:54.529
You gotta give me a sign.

1:07:54.612 --> 1:07:56.906
Give me a sign. Give me a sign.

1:08:00.785 --> 1:08:03.538
Oh, my God, that's it.
That's it! That's it!

1:08:04.872 --> 1:08:06.207
Lucas!

1:08:06.291 --> 1:08:08.334
It is a pretty sweet waterslide.

1:08:08.418 --> 1:08:10.211
[breathing heavily]

1:08:10.295 --> 1:08:11.295
Lucas!

1:08:41.326 --> 1:08:42.869
Oh, my God, Lucas!

1:08:42.952 --> 1:08:45.413
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

1:08:45.496 --> 1:08:46.623
Oh.

1:08:46.706 --> 1:08:49.334
Oh, I'm never taking
my eyes off you again. Okay?

1:08:49.417 --> 1:08:51.336
- Okay.
- Okay.

1:08:51.419 --> 1:08:52.754
I promise.

1:08:52.837 --> 1:08:54.088
Oh, my God.

1:08:55.089 --> 1:08:58.384
- You okay?
- [giggles]

1:08:58.468 --> 1:09:00.386
- You want to do it again?
- No.

1:09:00.470 --> 1:09:03.222
Okay. Yeah. Me neither.

1:09:04.474 --> 1:09:05.558
[exhales]

1:09:08.728 --> 1:09:10.730
[Gary] I'm sorry we lost Reeroy...

1:09:11.648 --> 1:09:13.358
your evil goat puppet.

1:09:15.068 --> 1:09:16.986
We'll find you another one, all right?

1:09:20.198 --> 1:09:21.198
Gary.

1:09:24.827 --> 1:09:28.623
- Yes, Lucas?
- I'm sorry I buried you in the backyard.

1:09:30.416 --> 1:09:32.001
That's all right, I get it.

1:09:33.628 --> 1:09:35.296
Sorry I put sand in your floaties.

1:09:36.047 --> 1:09:38.633
That's okay. I get it.

1:09:40.343 --> 1:09:43.554
I guess I haven't been
a very good stepdad, have I?

1:09:44.555 --> 1:09:46.182
You're still here.

1:09:51.104 --> 1:09:55.400
Uh... Lucas, can I tell you something?
Something I've never told anyone?

1:09:56.567 --> 1:09:59.862
Did you know that
I never knew my father growing up?

1:10:00.780 --> 1:10:02.532
He split on me when I was just a baby.

1:10:03.741 --> 1:10:08.413
So, when I was 20 years old,
I decided to go find him.

1:10:09.622 --> 1:10:10.998
And when I finally did,

1:10:11.082 --> 1:10:16.546
he told me that I was a worthless loser
who would never do anything with his life.

1:10:19.465 --> 1:10:20.883
You know what I decided?

1:10:22.218 --> 1:10:24.178
That I didn't have to listen to my dad.

1:10:26.097 --> 1:10:28.933
You know, Lucas,
I don't care who your real dad is

1:10:29.016 --> 1:10:33.730
or if you were spawned from a cult ritual.
You are you.

1:10:35.565 --> 1:10:38.776
And you can be
whoever you want to be, okay?

1:10:42.947 --> 1:10:43.947
Daddy?

1:10:46.159 --> 1:10:47.618
Yeah, Lucas?

1:10:47.702 --> 1:10:49.829
I don't want you to die anymore.

1:10:50.496 --> 1:10:52.331
I don't want you to die anymore, either.

1:10:52.415 --> 1:10:56.669
And you're right. My real dad
isn't a really good influence on me.

1:10:57.795 --> 1:10:59.338
No, I don't think he is.

1:11:01.591 --> 1:11:04.969
Hold on. Do you... know your real dad?

1:11:05.052 --> 1:11:08.890
Well, sometimes he talks to me
through my toys and the TV.

1:11:08.973 --> 1:11:12.435
That's a really good reason
to limit your TV time.

1:11:12.518 --> 1:11:16.731
And he said he wants full "custoty."

1:11:16.814 --> 1:11:18.649
Do you know what that means?

1:11:19.567 --> 1:11:21.360
Yeah. Yeah, it's not good.

1:11:21.444 --> 1:11:24.697
Listen, your mom and I
will never let that happen.

1:11:24.781 --> 1:11:26.783
Do you understand? I promise.

1:11:26.866 --> 1:11:29.702
[phone beeping]

1:11:29.786 --> 1:11:31.120
It's an Amber Alert.

1:11:33.164 --> 1:11:34.832
Wait, that's my license.

1:11:36.959 --> 1:11:37.960
Shit.

1:11:38.044 --> 1:11:41.130
Lucas, finish your ice cream.
We got to go.

1:11:41.214 --> 1:11:42.340
[police siren]

1:11:44.175 --> 1:11:45.510
- Hands in the air!
- Okay.

1:11:45.593 --> 1:11:46.928
- What did I do?
- Keep 'em up!

1:11:47.011 --> 1:11:49.472
[demonic voice] You can go to hell!

1:11:49.555 --> 1:11:52.475
Don't say that to the officers!
We're working on our manners.

1:11:52.558 --> 1:11:53.810
Arms behind your back.

1:11:53.893 --> 1:11:56.312
Officer, I think there's a mistake,
I'm his step...

1:11:56.896 --> 1:11:58.731
Ow! What are you doing?

1:12:00.316 --> 1:12:04.654
My, my, my, my, my.
What a scene. What a scene.

1:12:04.737 --> 1:12:07.073

The reverend? No. You can't take him!
He's just a child!

Sure he is. And I'm just a sweet little

he's gonna make his own choices,

is not Satan himself,

1:16:09.106 --> 1:16:10.399
but a portal to Satan.

1:16:10.941 --> 1:16:13.819
And that by killing him,
that portal will open,

1:16:13.903 --> 1:16:16.280
and the real Satan
can then enter his body,

1:16:16.363 --> 1:16:18.032
and the end of the world will ensue.

1:16:18.574 --> 1:16:21.744

his real father wanting full custody.

Shit, dude, that's never good.

1:16:24.205 --> 1:16:27.500
Those guys, Gozamel and the reverend,
they wanted me to kill Lucas.

Right, to bring on the apocalypse.

1:16:30.044 --> 1:16:32.925

- They're gonna do it themselves.

1:16:33.130 --> 1:16:35.341
- But they have to do it...
- On hallowed ground.

1:16:35.424 --> 1:16:37.968

That's why the reverend bought it.

He's gonna have, like,

"Is this who I really want..."

1:23:39.431 --> 1:23:40.474
Oh, shit.

1:23:40.557 --> 1:23:43.143
"to... be...?"

1:23:44.019 --> 1:23:45.145
Oh, shit.

1:23:45.854 --> 1:23:47.397
Hey, Lucas?

1:23:48.440 --> 1:23:49.691
You okay, buddy?

1:23:52.653 --> 1:23:54.321
[demonic growl]

1:23:54.905 --> 1:23:56.865
[all exclaiming]

1:24:07.876 --> 1:24:09.169
Lucas!

1:24:09.670 --> 1:24:10.670
[Gary] Lucas!

1:24:12.172 --> 1:24:13.172
Lucas!

1:24:14.841 --> 1:24:15.926
[grunts]

1:24:19.096 --> 1:24:21.139
I got you, buddy! I got you!

1:24:22.391 --> 1:24:24.226
[demonic voice] Let me go!

1:24:24.309 --> 1:24:27.020
- No!
- You must let me go!

1:24:27.104 --> 1:24:28.897
No! I won't!

1:24:31.567 --> 1:24:33.735
- [normal voice] Daddy?
- Yes, Lucas?

1:24:34.861 --> 1:24:36.071
I'm scared.

1:24:36.738 --> 1:24:38.156
Don't be scared, sweetie.

1:24:39.241 --> 1:24:43.704
- I got you.
- [demonic voice] Let him go!

1:24:47.040 --> 1:24:49.543
[screaming]

1:24:51.628 --> 1:24:54.840
Okay, maybe a little fear
is totally justified,

1:24:54.923 --> 1:24:56.550
but I'm not letting you go!

1:24:56.633 --> 1:24:58.010
I'm never letting go, buddy!

1:24:58.093 --> 1:25:01.096
- Why?
- Because I'm your father!

1:25:01.179 --> 1:25:02.723
And I love you!

1:25:02.806 --> 1:25:05.684
[demonic voice] You're his stepfather!

1:25:05.767 --> 1:25:07.853
[screaming]

1:25:15.569 --> 1:25:16.862
I'm not leaving you!

1:25:25.037 --> 1:25:27.789
[groaning]

1:25:27.873 --> 1:25:29.166
Fuck!

1:25:30.542 --> 1:25:31.710
- Oh, my God.
- [coughing]

1:25:31.793 --> 1:25:33.545
- You okay?
- Yeah.

1:25:34.421 --> 1:25:35.881
- Gary.
- Gary.

1:25:42.346 --> 1:25:43.346
Lucas!

1:25:45.098 --> 1:25:46.141
Gary!

1:25:48.977 --> 1:25:51.730
- I'm sorry.
- I'm so sorry.

1:25:55.901 --> 1:25:57.069
[Samantha crying]

1:26:00.530 --> 1:26:01.530
Oh, my God!

1:26:01.573 --> 1:26:03.617
[overlapping chatter]

1:26:03.700 --> 1:26:05.077
- Help him up!
- Come on.

1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:06.578
- Easy.
- All right.

1:26:10.415 --> 1:26:11.541
Let him breathe.

1:26:11.625 --> 1:26:13.919
That's some Indiana Jones shit, dawg.

1:26:14.419 --> 1:26:17.297
Holy shit. Oh, my God.

1:26:17.381 --> 1:26:20.008
He's probably got minor scrapes,
but you know...

1:26:20.467 --> 1:26:23.053
- It's 'cause of us. It's 'cause of us.
- We did good.

1:26:23.136 --> 1:26:27.099
Hon, you told me when you're a parent,
you hope for the best,

1:26:27.182 --> 1:26:28.475
but prepare for the worst.

1:26:28.558 --> 1:26:30.727
- Yeah.
- Please tell me that was it.

1:26:30.811 --> 1:26:32.020
[laughs]

1:26:32.104 --> 1:26:34.064
You did it. [chuckles]

1:26:34.147 --> 1:26:35.941
You really came through for us.

1:26:36.775 --> 1:26:38.026
You're the one, baby.

1:26:38.735 --> 1:26:40.028
You were always the one.

1:26:40.612 --> 1:26:41.697
I love you.

1:26:42.489 --> 1:26:43.489
[grunts]

1:26:45.867 --> 1:26:47.035
I love you, too.

1:26:49.663 --> 1:26:51.943
[dad] I wish I had a bonding moment
like this with my son.

1:26:53.166 --> 1:26:55.794
- Not exactly like this.
- A milkshake with two straws.

1:26:55.877 --> 1:26:58.678
[dad] No, I know, a Little League game,
like, a ball game or something.

1:26:58.755 --> 1:26:59.589
I mean, there was fucking...

1:26:59.715 --> 1:27:01.383
The child must die!

1:27:01.466 --> 1:27:02.718
- Mom!
- Come on.

1:27:02.801 --> 1:27:04.553
[shouts]

1:27:04.636 --> 1:27:06.304
[all grunting]

1:27:06.388 --> 1:27:09.099
- [screaming]
- Oh, shit!

1:27:09.558 --> 1:27:11.852
Don't ever fuck with my kid again!

1:27:12.436 --> 1:27:13.812
- Okay.
- That's bad-ass.

1:27:13.895 --> 1:27:17.065
They both punch really well, like,
when people run up to them in churches.

1:27:17.149 --> 1:27:19.229
Can we get out of here?
I just wanna get out of here.

1:27:20.026 --> 1:27:21.027
Yeah.

1:27:21.111 --> 1:27:22.821
- I think we go.
- Okay, let's go.

1:27:23.572 --> 1:27:26.700
[Samantha sighs] Let's go, guys.
Come on. Tomorrow's a new day.

1:27:26.783 --> 1:27:28.184
- [Gary] Yeah.
- [Samantha] Oh, boy.

1:27:28.785 --> 1:27:30.386
[Gary] You know, this might sound weird,

1:27:30.454 --> 1:27:33.915
but I think maybe
we should go get some ice cream.

1:27:33.999 --> 1:27:36.084
[dad] I still have my kid's backpack
in my trunk.

1:27:36.168 --> 1:27:38.420
We go get ice cream,
and then all shit in it.

1:27:38.503 --> 1:27:41.631
- [dad 2] I can shit in your backpack now.
- [Gary] Yeah, sure, why not?

1:27:41.715 --> 1:27:44.634
[dad 3] I already shit my pants, though.
I don't know if I have any left.

1:27:44.718 --> 1:27:46.720

1:27:59.274 --> 1:28:00.650
All right, you guys are up next.

1:28:00.734 --> 1:28:02.861
- No, no, no. We're not ready.
- Yes, we are.

1:28:02.944 --> 1:28:05.572
- Dad, we're fine.
- Okay, best of luck to both you guys.

1:28:06.239 --> 1:28:09.868
Lucas, we are not ready yet.
I haven't adjusted the steering column.

1:28:09.951 --> 1:28:12.329
- The brakes...
- Stop worrying, okay?

1:28:12.412 --> 1:28:15.415
- Okay. All right.
- You just have to trust me.

1:28:15.499 --> 1:28:16.500
I trust you.

1:28:16.583 --> 1:28:18.960
- And I'm driving.
- What?

1:28:19.044 --> 1:28:21.213
No, no, no. You can't drive. You're six.

1:28:21.296 --> 1:28:22.798
[cheering]

1:28:22.881 --> 1:28:25.801
All right, just don't turn too hard
in either direction, okay?

1:28:25.884 --> 1:28:27.469
Just try to keep it steady.

1:28:27.552 --> 1:28:29.137
- [horn blares]
- Whoa!

1:28:29.221 --> 1:28:31.389
Look at the cool design on that one!

1:28:31.473 --> 1:28:34.643
I'm not gonna lie, man.
That's pretty fucking rad, bro!

1:28:34.726 --> 1:28:36.311
- There they go! Let's go!
- Shit!

1:28:36.895 --> 1:28:39.981
- Hey! Who wants it more, baby?
- Go defense!

1:28:40.065 --> 1:28:42.108
Go, Gary! Go, Lucas!

1:28:43.443 --> 1:28:45.445
Not too much! Back the other way!

1:28:46.321 --> 1:28:49.950
Hang on, Dad.
Things are just about to get interesting.

1:28:50.033 --> 1:28:52.327
- Lucas! Lucas! [screams]
- Yeah!
