LOOKING FOR YOU.

10:28.836 --> 10:31.714
{\an1}I KNOW, AND I DIDN'T PUT
THE PAINTING IN THE TROPHY CASE.

10:31.797 --> 10:33.549
{\an1}BUT ART MOVES PEOPLE,
AND I'M GLAD I MADE IT.

10:33.632 --> 10:36.719
{\an5}ME, TOO.
THAT'S WHY I PUT IT
IN THE TROPHY CASE.

10:36.802 --> 10:38.804
{\an1}WAIT. YOU PUT IT
THERE? WHY?

10:40.973 --> 10:42.850
HOW ABOUT I TELL YOU
ABOUT IT AT THE ART SHOW?

10:45.978 --> 10:48.773
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN...
[CLAPPING]

10:48.856 --> 10:53.402
I GIVE TO YOU
"ORANGE NAKED LADY" AGAIN!

10:53.486 --> 10:58.032
{\an1}I'LL GIVE YOU $20,000
FOR IT RIGHT NOW,

10:58.115 --> 11:01.786
{\an1}PROVIDING IT GOES
TO THE SCHOOL'S ART PROGRAM

11:01.869 --> 11:04.622
{\an1}SO THAT ARTISTS
LIKE THIS MAY CONTINUE

11:04.705 --> 11:07.291
{\an1}TO EXPRESS
THEMSELVES FREELY.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.921
HA HA HA...

11:12.004 --> 11:13.005
LET'S JUST SAY

11:13.089 --> 11:15.299
{\an1}THAT I THOUGHT THE ART SHOW
COULD USE SOME PUBLICITY

11:15.383 --> 11:19.637
AND YOU COULD USE
SOME FAME.

11:22.973 --> 11:24.934
Ned: SO, PRINCIPAL WRIGHT
PROVED TO BE

11:25.017 --> 11:26.644
A BIT OF AN ARTIST HIMSELF,

11:26.727 --> 11:29.271
AND HIS MASTERPIECE--
PRESERVING ART CLASS.

TO HIS FACTORY OF ONE

11:31.899 --> 11:33.317

A GIFT FROM YOUR HEART

11:33.401 --> 11:36.028
UNLESS YOU
MAKE IT YOURSELF.

11:36.112 --> 11:38.697
AND MOZE DECIDED TO PHOTOGRAPH
FRUIT INSTEAD OF PEOPLE

11:38.781 --> 11:41.450
BECAUSE FRUIT
DOESN'T GET ANGRY.

11:45.913 --> 11:49.667
AND I LEARNED THAT ART IS
MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOU THINK.

11:49.750 --> 11:51.669
{\an1}IT'S ALL AROUND US,
AND WITHOUT IT,

11:51.752 --> 11:54.130
LIFE AND SCHOOL WOULD BE
PRETTY BORING.

11:54.213 --> 11:55.172
I CALL IT
"RED NAKED LADY."

THE LADDER.

12:03.431 --> 12:04.640
{\an1}AH!

12:04.723 --> 12:06.642
I TOLD YOU
IT WAS A NAKED LADY.

12:06.725 --> 12:08.727
{\an1}NO. IT'S JUST
THE WORST FIRE TRUCK

12:08.811 --> 12:10.396
I'VE EVER SEEN.

12:17.653 --> 12:20.573

13:43.572 --> 13:46.158
THE BEST WAY TO KEEP YOUR STUFF
OUT OF THE LOST AND FOUND

13:46.242 --> 13:47.618
IS PREVENTION.

13:47.701 --> 13:51.121

EXCEPT YOUR UNDERWEAR,

13:51.205 --> 13:52.623

LOSE THOSE,

13:52.706 --> 13:54.667

TO KNOW THEY'RE YOURS.

IS ELECTRONIC SENSORS.
