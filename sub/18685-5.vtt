WEBVTT

00:02.703 --> 00:03.871
(birds chirping)

00:03.904 --> 00:06.174
(footsteps approaching)

00:06.207 --> 00:07.875
Morning.

00:16.184 --> 00:17.985
What you drinkin'?

00:18.018 --> 00:19.820
Coffee. I like it when I smoke.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.656
Yeah, so do I. So does everyone.
That's why I made it.

00:22.690 --> 00:24.492
Oh. Cool. Thank you.

00:24.525 --> 00:26.694
I don't want a "thank you."
I want my coffee.

00:26.727 --> 00:27.695
Then make some more.
There is

00:27.728 --> 00:29.663
no more, or I would.
I left for, like,

00:29.697 --> 00:30.598
two seconds to grab a cigarette.

00:30.631 --> 00:32.200
You shouldn't have left it
unattended, then.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.535
Okay. Well, good advice.

00:39.207 --> 00:41.709
(gasping breath)
Ooh.

00:41.742 --> 00:43.077
It's a little hot, isn't it?

00:43.111 --> 00:45.613
(exhales): Good hot.
It's just the way I like it.

00:46.947 --> 00:49.117
(doorbell rings)
I'll get it. (exhales)

00:52.386 --> 00:53.887
Oh, Liz!

00:53.921 --> 00:55.856
To what do we owe this pleasure?

00:55.889 --> 00:59.227
I caught him in my bushes
videotaping me in my shower!

00:59.260 --> 01:00.094
Gross.

01:01.229 --> 01:03.597
Not you.
Just... gross.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.032
Omicron made
me do it.

01:05.065 --> 01:05.866
Come on.

01:05.899 --> 01:06.867
Who is Omicron?

01:06.900 --> 01:08.436
It's-- come here.
It's his imaginary friend.

01:08.469 --> 01:10.904
Can you cut him some slack?
He's going through a thing.

01:10.938 --> 01:12.906
Frankly, I don't care.
Ever since you showed up,

01:12.940 --> 01:15.276
this whole family's been
nothing but trouble for me.
Okay.

01:15.309 --> 01:16.710
Keep him off my property,
Oh, yeah, yeah.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.613
or I'm calling the police.
Oh, yeah. Totally.
Okay, thank you so much.

01:19.647 --> 01:21.715
Hey, buddy,
you've been hanging out

01:21.749 --> 01:24.084
an awful lot with Omicron--
wouldn't you rather hang

01:24.118 --> 01:25.419
with some real people?

01:25.453 --> 01:27.955
Omicron is real--
he's from Jupiter

01:27.988 --> 01:29.757
and he talks like a robot.

01:29.790 --> 01:32.726
And we're fixing up
the tree house in the woods.

01:32.760 --> 01:34.728
Yeah, no, totally-- he's
real, and I get that.

01:34.762 --> 01:36.730
Yeah.
But here's the thing,
if you need something,

01:36.764 --> 01:38.632
just come to me--
don't go to a neighbor

01:38.666 --> 01:41.068
and ask for stuff,
okay? Deal?

01:41.101 --> 01:42.069
Deal.
Cool.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.404
Now, come on,
give me a hug.

01:43.437 --> 01:45.739
Then get out of here,
okay? See ya.

01:45.773 --> 01:49.443
Whoa-whoa-whoa-whoa!
Whoa. Get back here.

01:49.477 --> 01:50.278
Turn around.

01:50.311 --> 01:52.146
(Sabrina gasps)

01:52.180 --> 01:54.114
Ben! What?

01:54.948 --> 01:56.417
Ben...

01:56.450 --> 01:58.085
since when do you smoke?

01:58.118 --> 02:00.621
They're not for me,
they're for Omicron.
All right, you know what?

02:00.654 --> 02:03.090
I tried to be real cool
about this Omicron character,

02:03.123 --> 02:04.658
but clearly he's
a bad influence.

02:04.692 --> 02:05.993
Get up to your room.

02:06.026 --> 02:08.296
I hate you!
I hate you both!

02:08.329 --> 02:10.431
(quiet gasp)
Wow!

02:10.464 --> 02:12.933
What has gotten into that kid?
I have no idea.

02:12.966 --> 02:14.302
(grunts)

02:17.638 --> 02:19.673
*

02:19.707 --> 02:22.943
You two disgust me.
We said we were sorry.

02:22.976 --> 02:23.911
No, I sorry...

02:23.944 --> 02:26.280
for thinking I can count
on you degenerates.

02:26.314 --> 02:27.281
All right, we get it.

02:27.315 --> 02:28.982
Do ya? I don't think you do.
I think

02:29.016 --> 02:31.319
your brain's too clogged up
with smoke to "get" anything.

02:31.352 --> 02:34.355
You're the reason Ben is
out in the woods all day
just talking to himself.

02:34.388 --> 02:36.457
He's got an imaginary friend.
It's not a big deal.

02:36.490 --> 02:37.958
I had one when I was his age.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.793
Yeah. And look
how you turned out.

02:39.827 --> 02:41.562
Freakin' chimney
with a blonde wig.

02:43.030 --> 02:45.165
Maybe he should see
a psychiatrist.

02:45.199 --> 02:46.534
Absolutely not.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.969
Pembertons do not talk
to psychiatrists.

02:49.002 --> 02:52.840
What he needs is a
positive role model--
that's where I come in.

02:52.873 --> 02:53.841
Oh, God.

02:55.042 --> 02:57.177
(whispers):
Pathetic.

02:57.211 --> 02:58.178
Hmm.

02:58.212 --> 02:59.347
He's right.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.881
You should be ashamed.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.683
Yeah, I'm ashamed
as hell, okay?

03:02.716 --> 03:05.353
Kid's obviously
got some issues.
Yeah, it's probably our fault

03:05.386 --> 03:08.322
he made up Omicron
in the first place.

03:08.356 --> 03:12.159
I'm kind of getting anxious
just thinking about it.

03:12.192 --> 03:14.228
Think I need a cigarette. Yeah.
Should probably
have a cigarette.

03:14.262 --> 03:15.863
Wha...? I can't
believe you two.

03:15.896 --> 03:18.499
What kind of example are
you setting for Benito?

03:18.532 --> 03:20.067
Back off, Alba.
You don't get it.

03:20.100 --> 03:21.068
Don't I?

03:21.101 --> 03:22.503
MICKEY: Is that
a nicotine patch?

03:22.536 --> 03:23.671
Alba, you smoked?

03:23.704 --> 03:25.239
Yes, Alba smoked!

03:25.273 --> 03:27.007
Since I was four years old.

03:27.040 --> 03:30.511
In Guatemala they
would just hand them to
the children like candy.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.846
Oh, you are just full
of surprises.

03:32.880 --> 03:35.683
And now I hide the patches
in my first aid kit in my room

03:35.716 --> 03:37.951
because I am embarrassed.

03:39.387 --> 03:41.422
(sighs)
Maybe we should try it.

03:41.455 --> 03:43.891
Right? I mean, it worked
for her, it could work for us.

03:43.924 --> 03:45.559
Yeah, we got to do something.
Yeah.

03:45.593 --> 03:47.094
Yeah, maybe you go get one now.

03:47.127 --> 03:48.629
Okay.

03:52.065 --> 03:54.568
We were just kids.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.871
Hey, Ben, can we come in?

03:57.905 --> 03:59.239
Hey, buddy.

03:59.273 --> 04:00.874
Listen, we...

04:00.908 --> 04:03.277
feel like we came down on you
pretty hard earlier,

04:03.311 --> 04:05.279
and we are very sorry
about that.

04:05.313 --> 04:08.048
Yeah, we haven't been setting
the best example for you, but...

04:08.081 --> 04:10.551
starting today
that's all gonna change, okay?

04:10.584 --> 04:11.785
'Cause we're getting healthy.
We're getting healthy,

04:11.819 --> 04:13.387
and you know what
we're gonna do first?

04:13.421 --> 04:14.722
Quit smoking cigarettes.

04:14.755 --> 04:16.256
Because they're disgusting,
and they cause

04:16.290 --> 04:18.225
all kinds of nasty
side effects.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.226
Like what?

04:19.259 --> 04:20.894
Like asthma
Mm-hmm.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.397
and bad breath,
yellow teeth,

04:23.431 --> 04:25.399
gross skin...
D...

04:25.433 --> 04:27.301
Did you just point to me
for gross skin?

04:27.335 --> 04:29.903
You don't have great skin.

04:29.937 --> 04:30.904
Wha... All right.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.073
It doesn't matter.
That's all surface stuff,

04:33.106 --> 04:35.443
and everybody knows that
it's what's on the inside

04:35.476 --> 04:37.077
that matters the most.

04:37.110 --> 04:37.978
Let me ask you this

04:38.011 --> 04:39.813
important question:
when you grow up,

04:39.847 --> 04:42.916
you want to turn into
a moody little bitch?

04:42.950 --> 04:43.751
No.

04:43.784 --> 04:44.785
No!

04:44.818 --> 04:47.621
Nobody does, 'cause
it's awful to be around.

04:47.655 --> 04:49.623
So never smoke, got it?
Got it.

04:49.657 --> 04:50.924
Okay. Good.
Does this mean

04:50.958 --> 04:53.794
I can still be
friends with Omicron?

04:54.962 --> 04:55.963
Sure.

04:55.996 --> 04:59.433
Yeah. Just... stay
out of trouble, okay?
Okay.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.634
Maybe wash your
hands and face.

05:00.668 --> 05:02.135
Yeah. Take a shower.

05:03.136 --> 05:05.105
I think he got it, right?

05:05.138 --> 05:07.441
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I think he got it.

05:07.475 --> 05:09.276
Honestly, I got it.

05:09.309 --> 05:10.611
Cigarettes are nasty.

05:10.644 --> 05:12.646
I've been looking
for a reason to quit.

05:12.680 --> 05:14.615
Me, too. (sighs)

05:14.648 --> 05:16.684
I feel healthier
already.
Yeah.

05:16.717 --> 05:18.452
Me, too.
Yeah.

05:18.486 --> 05:21.154
Good night.
Good night.

05:21.188 --> 05:22.322
(crickets chirping)

05:22.356 --> 05:25.125
Busted! Oh-ho-ho-ho!

05:25.158 --> 05:25.993
Addict!

05:26.026 --> 05:28.529
You are so weak.
You're one to talk.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.130
Me? No! This?

05:30.163 --> 05:31.865
That's nothing. That's,
like, there was one left.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.667
I didn't want it
just hanging out

05:33.701 --> 05:35.335
Sure.
on my dresser, mocking me.

05:35.369 --> 05:36.470
"Sure."

05:36.504 --> 05:37.805
Wha...? Did you...

05:37.838 --> 05:39.640
did you open a new pack?
I'm responsibly

05:39.673 --> 05:41.308
weaning myself off.
Nah,

05:41.341 --> 05:42.810
you are so full of crap.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.845
So are you.
But guess what,
this is my last one.

05:44.878 --> 05:47.481
I just wanted one more
to remind me how gross
cigarettes are,

05:47.515 --> 05:48.682
and then I am done.

05:48.716 --> 05:50.484
Yeah.
I'm done, 'cause they're gross.

05:50.518 --> 05:52.720
Totally.
Done.

05:52.753 --> 05:55.022
MICKEY:
So, they only come through

05:55.055 --> 05:57.357
Rhode Island, like, once
every ten years, so everybody's

05:57.391 --> 05:58.692
super revved up for this show.

05:58.726 --> 05:59.993
I scalp tickets
in the parking lot,

06:00.027 --> 06:01.829
and, like, ten minutes
before they go onstage,

06:01.862 --> 06:03.664
I down an entire bottle
of cat morphine.

06:03.697 --> 06:05.198
Wait, what the hell is that?

06:05.232 --> 06:07.167
It's morphine for cats.

06:07.200 --> 06:09.069
Right. Stupid question.
Yeah. Right.

06:09.102 --> 06:10.704
Yeah.
So was the show awesome?

06:10.738 --> 06:13.006
Literally no idea.
I came to, like, four days later

06:13.040 --> 06:15.008
in a mental institution
getting my hair braided

06:15.042 --> 06:17.678
by a woman who thought
she was Lou Diamond Phillips.
(laughs)

06:17.711 --> 06:19.346
You are nothing
like my mom.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.215
Oh, yeah? Where do you think
I got the cat morphine?

06:22.249 --> 06:23.851
(laughs)

06:23.884 --> 06:26.253
Give me another one.

06:26.286 --> 06:28.856
Ah.
That's it?

06:28.889 --> 06:30.357
Party's over.
All right, well, give me yours.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.859
No way. You shouldn't have
sucked yours down so fast.

06:31.892 --> 06:34.027
Well, I was in the middle
of a very exciting story.

06:34.061 --> 06:36.564
Wha... You know what?
Okay.

06:36.597 --> 06:37.731
Fine, that's cool.

06:37.765 --> 06:39.199
We're nonsmokers now.
Yeah. We're done.

06:39.232 --> 06:41.869
That's what we wanted.
We got what we wanted.
Mm-hmm.

06:41.902 --> 06:44.204
It's too bad,
'cause that was fun.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.039
It was little fun.
We, uh, became
Yeah.

06:46.073 --> 06:48.041
smoking buddies
just in time to stop.
Right.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.443
I'll see you tomorrow.
Yeah.

06:57.918 --> 06:58.886
Doesn't get much
better than this--

06:58.919 --> 07:00.888
quality time with
your big bro.

07:00.921 --> 07:02.890
Lungs filled with fresh air.

07:02.923 --> 07:05.392
I should get back
to Omicron soon.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.060
Mm, actually,
I spoke with Omicron.

07:07.094 --> 07:09.062
He said you should hang out
with me today.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.599
That's weird. Omicron hates you.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.100
He hates me? What'd I do?

07:13.133 --> 07:16.904
Mm, he just thinks you look
stupid and you stink and stuff.

07:16.937 --> 07:20.073
Yeah? How 'bout you tell Omicron
to say that to my face

07:20.107 --> 07:22.275
so I can slap his bitch ass
right back to the woods.

07:22.309 --> 07:25.746
You can try,
but he's way bigger than you.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.280
Why don't we shut up
about Omicron, okay?

07:27.314 --> 07:30.250
Today is about soaking
up all my knowledge.

07:30.283 --> 07:33.621
Got any questions?
Mm,

07:33.654 --> 07:35.288
what are smells made out of?

07:35.322 --> 07:38.258
Get on the bike.

07:38.291 --> 07:41.595
All right, now, just keep
these handlebars straight

07:41.629 --> 07:43.931
and just keep pedaling
once I let you go, okay?

07:43.964 --> 07:46.266
All right. Now, just keep
your feet on the pedals.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.769
All right? Hey,
you're doing fine.

07:48.802 --> 07:50.470
You're doing great.

07:51.539 --> 07:53.440
Whoa, no,
no, no!

07:53.473 --> 07:55.308
Slow down! Slow down!

07:55.342 --> 07:56.810
(screams, grunts)

07:56.844 --> 07:58.278
(panting)

07:58.311 --> 08:00.147
Oh! Oh, no!

08:00.180 --> 08:02.650
Oh, no! Oh, I think
I killed him!

08:02.683 --> 08:04.785
Aah! I killed him! Oh, no!

08:04.818 --> 08:06.286
Anybody!

08:06.319 --> 08:08.856
(high-pitched):
Anybody! Help!

08:08.889 --> 08:09.857
(coughing)
Keep up!

08:09.890 --> 08:10.991
Get off my back!
I didn't berate you

08:11.024 --> 08:12.826
when you barfed all over
the sidewalk. (whimpers)

08:12.860 --> 08:15.629
Yes, you did.
(coughs)
Yeah, I did.

08:15.663 --> 08:17.798
What's this?

08:17.831 --> 08:20.367
Huh?

08:23.070 --> 08:25.038
Hey. Excuse me,
gentlemen.

08:25.072 --> 08:26.006
What's happening?

08:26.039 --> 08:27.808
Guesthouse caught
fire last night.

08:27.841 --> 08:30.043
Oh.
Uh...

08:30.077 --> 08:31.812
You don't think
that we...

08:31.845 --> 08:33.380
No, yeah, I do
think that we.

08:33.413 --> 08:35.315
(whispering): We flicked,
like, 20 butts over the fence.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.383
Let's go.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.318
LIZ:
Hey!

08:38.351 --> 08:39.519
Mackenzie!

08:41.021 --> 08:42.522
Just the person
I wanted to see.

08:42.556 --> 08:43.891
Hey, what's up, Liz?
What's going on?

08:43.924 --> 08:46.159
I'll tell you what's going on.
That sociopath nephew of yours

08:46.193 --> 08:48.562
just burned down my guesthouse.

08:48.596 --> 08:50.330
What? That is so stupid.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.165
Is it?
The little maniac clearly has

08:52.199 --> 08:53.701
some perverted obsession
with me.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.403
Oh, do not flatter yourself.
All that stuff was for Omicron.

08:56.436 --> 08:59.573
Yeah, come on, he's a kid.
He doesn't smoke cigarettes.

08:59.607 --> 09:02.175
How'd you know
it was a cigarette?

09:02.209 --> 09:05.913
I-I didn't know,
but I guessed.
Hey, good-good
guess on the cigarettes.

09:05.946 --> 09:07.547
I did guess it.
Good guess.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.216
It's a good guess. I would've
guessed the same thing.
Yeah, if I said

09:09.249 --> 09:11.585
"fire,"
she would think...
Smokey the Bear!

09:11.619 --> 09:13.754
And then I would
think cigarettes.
Second...

09:13.787 --> 09:15.355
Second,
she'd think "cigarette."
It's just that they...

09:15.388 --> 09:16.590
The-the three go together.
Okay,

09:16.624 --> 09:17.524
okay, okay!
Yeah.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.593
I am done playing games
with you people.

09:19.627 --> 09:23.196
That little creep
is going down for this.

09:23.230 --> 09:25.198
I just tried...
You stop it.

09:25.232 --> 09:27.034
Not now. Let's go.

09:27.067 --> 09:28.769
You took some
tumble today.

09:28.802 --> 09:31.371
You used up every bandage
in Alba's first aid kit.

09:31.404 --> 09:33.540
I feel better already.

09:33.573 --> 09:36.710
Don't worry. Chicks dig scars.

09:36.744 --> 09:39.379
All right.

09:39.412 --> 09:41.548
I'm not the one who
screamed "cigarettes"
to the entire neighborhood.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.050
I know, but I'm
a little scatterbrained, okay?

09:43.083 --> 09:45.385
I haven't gone this long
without a smoke in years.
Yeah, I get it,

09:45.418 --> 09:46.920
but now your little brother
is the prime suspect

09:46.954 --> 09:49.923
in an arson investigation.
So can you work...
I... Yeah.
Miss Mickey?

09:49.957 --> 09:53.093
A man from the fire department
is here to see you.

09:53.927 --> 09:56.263
Hmm.

09:57.765 --> 10:00.267
Mm-hmm.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.736
Good afternoon!
(chuckles)

10:02.770 --> 10:04.805
Hello. I'm
Lieutenant Shields.
Hi.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.407
I'm sorry to bother you,
but I was hoping to speak

10:07.440 --> 10:09.743
to your nephew about
the fire next door.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.812
Okay, you know what,
this is so absurd.

10:11.845 --> 10:14.281
That woman has been irritated
with my family

10:14.314 --> 10:16.583
since she got Tasered
in my foyer.

10:16.616 --> 10:18.151
I just need to ask the boy
a few questions,

10:18.185 --> 10:19.452
and I'll be out of your hair.

10:20.620 --> 10:22.089
(sighs)

10:22.122 --> 10:24.758
Uh, yeah.

10:24.792 --> 10:26.326
I mean, yeah, of course.

10:26.359 --> 10:28.461
We are happy to help.

10:30.197 --> 10:32.632
Knock, knock.
Anybody home?

10:32.666 --> 10:34.434
Ben?

10:34.467 --> 10:37.104
(static)

10:37.137 --> 10:38.806
Ben?

10:42.142 --> 10:45.345
What the hell happened
to your face, buddy?

10:45.378 --> 10:47.647
I fell off my bike.

10:47.681 --> 10:48.515
Are you okay?

10:49.717 --> 10:50.550
Does it hurt?

10:52.319 --> 10:54.822
Well, that's normal.
You know, normal kid stuff.

10:54.855 --> 10:56.623
Bikes and scrapes and stuff.

10:56.656 --> 10:59.827
(stammers) Uh, this guy wants
to ask you a few questions.

10:59.860 --> 11:00.994
Is that okay?

11:01.028 --> 11:02.329
Yeah.
Okay.

11:02.362 --> 11:04.798
Hello, Ben. My name
is Lieutenant Shields.

11:04.832 --> 11:06.333
I'm a fire investigator.

11:06.366 --> 11:09.302
Cool! I love fire.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.839
Well, all right, I mean,
who doesn't, you know?

11:11.872 --> 11:14.507
'Cause fire's...
He's right-- it's cool.

11:14.541 --> 11:17.044
You know? I mean, you dedicated
your life to it, you know?

11:17.077 --> 11:19.847
For all we know, you're the one
who torched the guesthouse.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.481
Excuse me?
Right?

11:21.514 --> 11:23.851
I'm just saying, have you seen
Backdraft? He did it.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.018
Who's "he"?

11:25.052 --> 11:26.686
One of the Baldwin brothers.

11:26.720 --> 11:28.989
Right? Wasn't it?
It wasn't the good one.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.558
It also wasn't the bad one.
Again, it's tough to say.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.160
They all have
the same kind of...

11:33.193 --> 11:34.494
I don't know.
It-It's been a while

11:34.527 --> 11:37.230
since I've seen the movie.
Just a-ask the questions.

11:37.264 --> 11:39.399
Ben, what did you do last night?

11:39.432 --> 11:42.335
I was supposed to see Omicron,

11:42.369 --> 11:44.905
but that neighbor lady
ruined it.

11:44.938 --> 11:46.740
And who's Omicron?

11:46.774 --> 11:48.508
Well, that's
his imaginary friend.

11:48.541 --> 11:50.343
You know,
totally normal, healthy,

11:50.377 --> 11:51.745
sane. (chuckles)
You know.

11:51.779 --> 11:55.348
Uh-huh. Can I talk to Omicron?

11:55.382 --> 11:57.584
I doubt it.
He doesn't like people.

11:57.617 --> 12:00.520
Yeah, he doesn't like people.
Uh, me neither.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.589
What does he think
of your neighbor?

12:02.622 --> 12:04.758
Let's just say
he's not gonna be happy

12:04.792 --> 12:06.927
when he finds out
she got me in trouble.

12:06.960 --> 12:10.430
He'll be like... (gruffly):
"I'll tear the heart out

12:10.463 --> 12:11.598
"of that woman

12:11.631 --> 12:14.701
if she messes
with you, Ben."

12:14.734 --> 12:16.870
(laughs)

12:16.904 --> 12:18.205
Kids.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.572
Aren't they...
Isn't he cute?

12:19.606 --> 12:21.875
Kids. They just say
stupid stuff sometimes.

12:21.909 --> 12:24.111
It's not a big... Okay.
Good job, buddy.

12:24.144 --> 12:26.446
Come on, guy.
(chuckles)

12:26.479 --> 12:29.783
(chuckles) That kid.
G-Great imagination, right?

12:29.817 --> 12:31.952
He's a... he's a good boy.

12:31.985 --> 12:33.887
Ma'am, I've been at this job
a long time,

12:33.921 --> 12:35.722
and sure as I'm standing here
breathing,

12:35.755 --> 12:37.724
that boy burned down
her guesthouse.

12:37.757 --> 12:39.793
You have to see that, right?

12:39.827 --> 12:41.962
W-- no, of course I don't
see that. Wait, I don...

12:41.995 --> 12:44.231
I-I also don't like
what you're insinuating.

12:44.264 --> 12:45.966
I'm not insinuating anything.

12:45.999 --> 12:48.068
Uh...

12:48.101 --> 12:50.838
Oh, that's not good.

12:54.942 --> 12:57.077
Now they definitely think he did
it. What are we gonna do?

12:57.110 --> 12:59.412
I think we're gonna
have to face the music.
Yeah, you're right.

12:59.446 --> 13:00.580
Or, you know,

13:00.613 --> 13:02.249
maybe you could do it.
What?

13:02.282 --> 13:03.917
Well, I just think
it's crazy for all of us

13:03.951 --> 13:05.252
to take the fall for this.

13:05.285 --> 13:06.419
Your life is already over.

13:06.453 --> 13:07.620
How the hell is my life over?

13:07.654 --> 13:08.822
I didn't mean it like that.
I just mean

13:08.856 --> 13:10.490
it's too late
to get it back on track.

13:10.523 --> 13:13.293
Oh, get out of here.
I'm a young woman.

13:13.326 --> 13:14.962
I'm in the prime of my
life. You're a baby.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.930
In fact, you should take the
fall. Because you're a minor,

13:16.964 --> 13:19.432
they'll go easy on you. Plus, it
was most likely your cigarette

13:19.466 --> 13:20.633
that did it.
Oh, yeah?

13:20.667 --> 13:22.102
How do you figure that?
Please, I have seen you

13:22.135 --> 13:25.138
throw away full cherries.
I smoke mine down to the filter.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.307
Like an American.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.479
(exhales)

13:33.546 --> 13:35.682
I've got an idea.

13:39.152 --> 13:43.790
What if-- and hear me out--
we let Ben take the fall?

13:43.823 --> 13:44.624
I'm listening.

13:44.657 --> 13:45.959
I mean,
we know the kid's innocent,

13:45.993 --> 13:48.028
but we can all agree
something ain't right there.

13:48.061 --> 13:49.162
No, he's a freak, for sure.

13:49.196 --> 13:51.331
And he's certainly not thriving
under our supervision.

13:51.364 --> 13:52.632
He's better off without us,
really.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.467
Right. And-and what's the worst
that could happen?

13:54.501 --> 13:56.970
They toss him in a military
academy for a few years?

13:57.004 --> 13:59.372
A little discipline might knock
the weird right out of him.

13:59.406 --> 14:02.309
You know what, he'd probably
come out in great shape, too.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.144
We'd be doing him a huge solid.

14:04.177 --> 14:06.513
It's kind of the kindest thing
we could do for that little boy.

14:06.546 --> 14:08.481
I knew it!
SABRINA: Alba, what the hell?!

14:08.515 --> 14:09.883
You are smoking?

14:09.917 --> 14:12.319
What about Benito?
Don't you care about Benito?

14:12.352 --> 14:15.188
Hey. We're smoking because
we care about Benito.

14:15.222 --> 14:17.690
We're trying to solve a
huge-ass problem over here.

14:17.724 --> 14:18.858
What happened to the patch?

14:18.892 --> 14:20.360
I love the patch.
Wha...?

14:20.393 --> 14:21.728
This combined
with the cigarettes

14:21.761 --> 14:22.996
is a whole new ball game.

14:23.030 --> 14:24.364
MICKEY: Oh, yeah, the
patch is rad, Alba.

14:24.397 --> 14:26.733
Guess what I did with mine.
I slapped it under the pits.

14:26.766 --> 14:27.834
Aw, come on.
Yeah.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.569
Oh, direct line right
to the bloodstream.

14:29.602 --> 14:30.503
Smart.
Yeah.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.505
Shame on both of you.
Hey.

14:32.539 --> 14:34.207
Hey, shame on you for
shaming all over us

14:34.241 --> 14:35.308
for trying to fix a problem.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.377
Either be part of the solution
or get the hell out.

14:37.410 --> 14:38.578
Yeah, Alba.

14:38.611 --> 14:40.413
What's it gonna be?

14:41.949 --> 14:43.917
(humming a tune)

14:45.052 --> 14:47.554
Hey. Just the guy
I wanted to s...

14:47.587 --> 14:49.022
(continues humming)

14:49.056 --> 14:50.123
What you looking for?

14:51.391 --> 14:54.061
Answers.

14:57.430 --> 14:59.199
Well, anyways...

14:59.232 --> 15:02.269
I just wanted to say sorry
about the whole bike thing.

15:02.302 --> 15:05.205
Don't worry, I'll tell Omicron
it was an accident.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.207
(chuckles softly):
It wa an accident.

15:07.240 --> 15:11.778
(gruff voice):
I hope he sees it that way.

15:11.811 --> 15:13.880
The point is...
I thought the two of us

15:13.913 --> 15:15.949
can, you know,
just chill and watch a movie.

15:15.983 --> 15:19.219
I can't. I got to
be in the woods.

15:19.252 --> 15:20.287
What's the hammer for?

15:20.320 --> 15:23.256
To bash stuff.

15:23.290 --> 15:25.292
What kind of stuff?

15:25.325 --> 15:27.894
Anything that gets in our way.

15:27.927 --> 15:29.662
Excuse me.

15:36.103 --> 15:38.005
(water running)

15:39.172 --> 15:41.408
Well, well, well.

15:41.441 --> 15:44.144
You find yourself
in quite the predicament.

15:44.177 --> 15:48.415
Confess and Ben goes free while
you spend your life in chains,

15:48.448 --> 15:50.483
or stay silent

15:50.517 --> 15:52.585
and betray an innocent boy.

15:52.619 --> 15:55.822
Yeah, we get what's going on--
we just explained it to you.

15:55.855 --> 15:58.325
Well, seems there's
only one solution.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.760
Un vagabundo.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.429
A... what?

16:02.462 --> 16:03.763
Nomad. A drifter.

16:03.796 --> 16:05.965
A man with no ties to society

16:05.999 --> 16:08.001
who could be easily forgotten.

16:08.035 --> 16:09.636
What are you even talking about?

16:09.669 --> 16:12.605
I do not know.

16:12.639 --> 16:14.141
I feel woozy.

16:14.174 --> 16:18.145
CHIP: Guys, we got
a big prob... (coughing)

16:19.179 --> 16:20.947
W...

16:20.980 --> 16:24.451
Well, this is just
fan-frickin-tastic!

16:24.484 --> 16:26.453
Well, it is not
what it looks like.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.288
No. I don't care. Smoke 'em up.

16:28.321 --> 16:31.324
As far as I'm concerned,
you can all get cancer.

16:31.358 --> 16:32.625
Oh, easy!
Too hard, Chip.

16:32.659 --> 16:35.462
While you zeroes are in here
getting high on cigarettes,

16:35.495 --> 16:37.330
Ben's losing his
freakin' mind!

16:37.364 --> 16:39.132
Okay. All right.
Well, I'll talk to him.

16:39.166 --> 16:40.833
Where is he?
Take a
wild guess.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.469
He's in the woods
with freakin' Omicron

16:42.502 --> 16:43.836
doing God knows what.

16:44.571 --> 16:45.638
I'm done.
Uh...

16:45.672 --> 16:47.040
I am done with him.
Okay.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.041
All right.

16:48.075 --> 16:51.744
Yeah, I'm gonna
catch up with you.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.348
(crickets chirping)

16:58.685 --> 17:03.356
Hey, Ben,
is it cool if we come up?

17:06.226 --> 17:07.060
(all gasp)

17:07.094 --> 17:10.530
Ooh, that was very creepy.

17:10.563 --> 17:11.531
Ladies first.

17:16.035 --> 17:20.940
(high-pitched sound repeating)
Uh... ugh.

17:28.881 --> 17:31.684
(exhales)
Hey, buddy, what you doing?

17:31.718 --> 17:35.054
Just hanging out with Omicron.

17:35.088 --> 17:37.524
Yeah, yeah, that's actually
why we came up here.

17:37.557 --> 17:39.058
We wanted to have
a little chat with you

17:39.092 --> 17:40.593
about your buddy Omicron.

17:40.627 --> 17:41.861
Who the hell are you?!

17:41.894 --> 17:44.897
(all yelling over each other)

17:45.798 --> 17:48.135
(Chip and Sabrina whimpering)

17:56.276 --> 17:59.546
(strained voice):
Name's Chester Omicron.

17:59.579 --> 18:01.714
Well, hello, Chester.

18:01.748 --> 18:03.950
He's from Jupiter.
Oh!

18:03.983 --> 18:05.552
Jupiter, Florida.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.086
(sounds of agreement)

18:07.120 --> 18:09.122
Isn't that Dad's coat?
Yeah.

18:09.156 --> 18:10.723
That's my coat.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.459
Ben gave it to me.

18:12.492 --> 18:15.061
Oh, Omicron,
that's Mickey,

18:15.094 --> 18:17.764
Sabrina, oh,
and that's my brother Chip

18:17.797 --> 18:20.267
who said all that
stuff about you.

18:20.300 --> 18:23.770
MICKEY: Uh...
Oh, no, no, I would never,
ever say anything...

18:23.803 --> 18:25.738
You calling him a liar?
No.

18:25.772 --> 18:28.074
SABRINA:
So... Omicron,

18:28.107 --> 18:29.909
what brings you to Greenwich?

18:29.942 --> 18:31.744
I came here to die.

18:31.778 --> 18:32.912
Mm!
Oh.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.247
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.582
SABRINA:
Right.

18:35.615 --> 18:37.083
So... sorry about that.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.252
I got diagnosed with...
(wheezing breath)

18:39.286 --> 18:41.254
lung cancer a few months back

18:41.288 --> 18:44.957
and wandered
into the woods to...

18:44.991 --> 18:46.092
(wheezing breath)

18:46.125 --> 18:47.794
smoke myself to death.

18:47.827 --> 18:49.596
Mm. Um...
Well...

18:49.629 --> 18:52.299
And that's
when I found him.

18:53.300 --> 18:54.801
This little guy's
the best.

18:54.834 --> 18:56.669
Yeah,
he sure is, yeah.

18:56.703 --> 18:57.937
Is he?!

18:57.970 --> 19:01.274
It seems to me you neglect
the hell out of him.

19:01.308 --> 19:02.609
I taught him
how to ride a bike.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.277
You nearly killed him!

19:04.311 --> 19:05.845
For God's sakes,
(wheezing breath)

19:05.878 --> 19:08.215
the kids covered in
nicotine patches.

19:10.350 --> 19:11.451
Oh.
Oh!

19:11.484 --> 19:12.452
Uh-- Chip?

19:12.485 --> 19:14.120
Mm, my-my bad.

19:14.153 --> 19:16.356
Okay, well, that explains
a lot of the behavior.

19:16.389 --> 19:18.491
I don't know where
he'd be without me.

19:18.525 --> 19:21.127
I taught him long division,
(wheezing breath)

19:21.160 --> 19:22.629
how to tell time,

19:22.662 --> 19:24.297
and to whistle.

19:24.331 --> 19:26.165
Show 'em.

19:26.199 --> 19:27.234
(blows air)

19:28.335 --> 19:29.836
We're still
working on that.

19:31.003 --> 19:32.505
This guy saved my life.

19:32.539 --> 19:35.174
(coughing)

19:41.180 --> 19:43.216
(normal voice):
He taught me how to love again.

19:43.250 --> 19:44.317
Oh.

19:44.351 --> 19:46.486
I'd do anything
to repay him.

19:46.519 --> 19:50.089
Oh, yeah?

19:52.392 --> 19:54.694
Anything?

19:54.727 --> 19:57.697
*

19:57.730 --> 20:00.233
Well, uh, this is a
mighty nice sacrifice

20:00.267 --> 20:02.702
you're making for
our family, Mr. Omicron.

20:02.735 --> 20:04.937
I'm doing it for Ben.

20:05.905 --> 20:07.707
Not you.

20:07.740 --> 20:09.509
Yeah.

20:09.542 --> 20:11.244
Yeah, well, nevertheless,
we appreciate it.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.746
If I hear
this kid's smoking,

20:13.780 --> 20:16.048
I'll come back...

20:16.082 --> 20:18.050
and I'll kill you.
Oh.

20:18.084 --> 20:19.185
Yep, got it.
Got it.

20:19.218 --> 20:23.055
And, Ben, I want you
to have something.

20:23.089 --> 20:24.391
If you ever need to talk to me,

20:24.424 --> 20:29.529
just use this
and I'll be there.

20:29.562 --> 20:30.897
Oh, well... oh.

20:30.930 --> 20:33.766
Mm.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.302
Bye, Omicron.

20:54.921 --> 20:57.624
*

20:57.657 --> 20:58.625
(shudders)

20:58.658 --> 21:00.126
Oh.
Ugh.

21:00.159 --> 21:03.262
(relieved sigh)

21:03.296 --> 21:05.264
You folks...
(wheezing breath)

21:05.298 --> 21:07.800
take care...
(wheezing breath)

21:07.834 --> 21:09.769
of yourselves.

21:14.273 --> 21:16.242
Yeah, that's right.

21:16.275 --> 21:18.345
Keep walking, bitch.

21:20.613 --> 21:24.917
(Liz screams)

21:24.951 --> 21:27.119
Okay, let's, uh,
buckle up and hit the road.

21:27.153 --> 21:28.287
Yeah.
Yeah.

21:29.789 --> 21:30.923
(Omicron wheezes)

21:30.957 --> 21:33.326
