00:00.066 --> 00:02.968
Adult adam: <i> Back in the '80s,</i>
<i> this is what cool looked like.</i>

00:02.970 --> 00:05.304
<i> The makeup was as heavy</i>
<i> as the perfume,</i>

00:05.306 --> 00:06.705
<i> The hair crimped and curled,</i>

00:06.707 --> 00:09.875
<i> And most importantly,</i>
<i> the shoulders bared.</i>

00:09.877 --> 00:11.510
<i> Even though my sister</i>
<i> owned the look,</i>

00:11.512 --> 00:13.812
<i> It was a bumpy ride</i>
<i> to get her there.</i>

00:13.814 --> 00:14.580
<i> Back in ninth grade,</i>

00:14.582 --> 00:18.584
<i> My sister was a giant ball</i>
<i> of awkwardness.</i>

00:19.252 --> 00:20.252
Hi, dan.

00:20.254 --> 00:21.320
(gasps)

00:21.322 --> 00:22.388
Cool clarinet.
(laughs)

00:22.390 --> 00:26.191
(lisping) um... So, I know
I've asked a few times,

00:26.193 --> 00:27.526
But did you
ever figure out

00:27.528 --> 00:29.595
Your plans
for the winter formal?

00:29.597 --> 00:30.462
Listen, erica...

00:30.464 --> 00:33.132
I only like you
as a lab partner.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.034
And to be honest,
e-even then,

00:35.036 --> 00:38.103
I fantasize about
other lab partners,

00:38.105 --> 00:39.505
So...

00:39.507 --> 00:42.241
Adult adam: <i> But then,</i>
<i> a miracle happened.</i>

00:42.243 --> 00:44.243
<i> Erica goldberg</i>
<i> got contact lenses,</i>

00:44.245 --> 00:48.580
<i> Stopped shampooing</i>
<i> with bar soap,</i>
<i> lost her braces,</i>

00:48.582 --> 00:52.851
<i> And learned how to tame</i>
<i> her rat's nest.</i>

00:53.887 --> 00:54.787
<i> And just like that,</i>

00:54.789 --> 00:58.757
<i> My sister blossomed</i>
<i> from awkward to awesome.</i>

00:59.726 --> 01:01.727
Hey. Hi, erica.

01:02.195 --> 01:03.162
Hey, don.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.296
It's, uh...
It's dan.

01:04.298 --> 01:07.833
But you could call me don
if you like that name better.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.902
<i> In fact, erica was so awesome</i>
<i> that in one week,</i>

01:09.904 --> 01:13.405
<i> She would get to be</i>
<i> on the coolest tv show</i>

01:13.407 --> 01:16.075
<i> Proudly filmed</i>
<i> in our hometown.</i>

01:16.077 --> 01:17.543
<i> It was</i> dance party usa...

01:17.545 --> 01:19.511
<i> 30 minutes</i>
<i> of fierce '80s grooving</i>

01:19.513 --> 01:22.047
<i> Featuring the hottest girls</i>
<i> and baddest boys</i>

01:22.049 --> 01:23.649
<i> In the skimpiest</i>
<i> of belly shirts.</i>

01:23.651 --> 01:25.851
Holy god,
look at those
dance moves!

01:25.853 --> 01:27.920
Lainey: I'd do anything
to tease my bangs
that high.

01:27.922 --> 01:31.056
Just think.
In one week,
everyone in school

01:31.058 --> 01:32.791
Will see us dancing
under those neon lights.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.393
We'll be
regionally famous.

01:34.395 --> 01:36.128
So, what moves
you gonna
bust out first?

01:36.130 --> 01:37.930
I'm thinking
I'd walk like an egyptian

01:37.932 --> 01:39.765
Right into
the safety dance.
(lainey squealing)

01:39.767 --> 01:43.302
Speaking of dancing,
barry has arrived!

01:43.304 --> 01:44.369
Whoo!
God, barry.

01:44.371 --> 01:47.539
The only thing worse
than your moves
is your gross eye.

01:47.541 --> 01:49.274
It's just pink eye.
Everyone gets it.

01:49.276 --> 01:53.445
Everyone doesn't get it
from a kaleidoscope
they found under a bridge.

01:53.447 --> 01:55.347
A goopy eye
is well worth

01:55.349 --> 01:58.417
The colorful view
of the world
this baby's given me.

01:58.419 --> 02:00.119
Honey, you're gonna
give it to your other eye.

02:00.121 --> 02:01.987
Huh?
Adult adam:
<i> Unlike erica,</i>

02:01.989 --> 02:03.489
<i> Barry was still struggling</i>
<i> to find his awesomeness,</i>

02:03.491 --> 02:07.426
<i> And growing that</i>
<i> rat tail last summer</i>
<i> didn't really help.</i>

02:07.428 --> 02:08.060
This...

02:08.062 --> 02:10.462
Will always
be awesome.

02:11.498 --> 02:13.565
I'm so stoked
to be on tv!

02:13.567 --> 02:16.401
I want to make sure
I lock down
a solo platform.

02:16.403 --> 02:18.003
That sounds like
a perfect plan.

02:18.005 --> 02:20.305
But there's only one
teeny, tiny problem...

02:20.307 --> 02:21.306
You're not coming.

02:21.308 --> 02:23.542
Lainey,
you're my girl, girl.

02:23.544 --> 02:25.210
Talk some sense
into her.

02:25.212 --> 02:26.712
You don't want him
to go?

02:26.714 --> 02:27.412
No.
Sorry.

02:27.414 --> 02:29.781
Did everything
I could.
Come on, baby.

02:29.783 --> 02:32.584
Look in my good eye
and give me
one reason why?

02:32.586 --> 02:34.620
Barry,
this is going on tv.

02:34.622 --> 02:35.721
They don't want
spazzy dancing freaks

02:35.723 --> 02:38.657
Who lose their mind
when the lunch lady
runs out of pudding.

02:38.659 --> 02:40.159
That only happened
three times!

02:40.161 --> 02:43.529
They should know by now
to fully stock the pudding!

02:43.531 --> 02:44.930
Sweetie,
you're doing it again.

02:44.932 --> 02:48.867
Fine. I'll just...
Dance it off, okay?

02:49.202 --> 02:50.602
Watch me go.

02:50.604 --> 02:52.471
How can you deny
the world

02:52.473 --> 02:54.840
This sweet
rhythmic magic, huh?

02:54.842 --> 02:57.009
Oh, is this
happening?
What?

02:57.011 --> 02:59.011
Barry: Get away!
I'm contagious!

02:59.013 --> 03:00.746
The only thing
that's contagious

03:00.748 --> 03:03.315
Are your sweet
dance moves.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.883
<i> ¶ I'm twisted up inside</i>

03:04.885 --> 03:08.820
<i> ¶ but nonetheless</i>
<i> I feel the need to say</i>

03:10.823 --> 03:11.924
<i> ¶ I don't know the future</i>

03:11.926 --> 03:16.028
<i> ¶ but the past keeps getting</i>
<i> clearer every day ¶</i>

03:16.030 --> 03:18.297
Adult adam:
<i> It was April 29,</i>
<i> 1980-something,</i>

03:18.299 --> 03:19.765
<i> And I was about</i>
<i> to spend the day</i>

03:19.767 --> 03:23.669
<i> With the most magical</i>
<i> badass I knew... Pops.</i>

03:23.671 --> 03:24.303
Here you go, boys.

03:24.305 --> 03:26.405
Toad in the hole
for my snuggle face,

03:26.407 --> 03:27.206
Raisin bran
and prune juice

03:27.208 --> 03:29.575
For the coolest
and most regular
daddy I know.

03:29.577 --> 03:31.310
That's a pass
on breakfast, bev.

03:31.312 --> 03:34.980
Me and the kid are headed out
for a big day on the town.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.215
First,
tennis at the club.

03:36.217 --> 03:38.016
And if there's time,
we hit the art museum.

03:38.018 --> 03:40.485
Honestly, there should be
a museum for the two of you.

03:40.487 --> 03:43.822
It will be called
the shmoopie center
for cuteness

03:43.824 --> 03:45.290
And I will be the curator

03:45.292 --> 03:46.725
And people will line up
for blocks

03:46.727 --> 03:48.093
Just to delight
in your deliciousness.

03:48.095 --> 03:50.529
She just had
her morning coffee.
You go.

03:50.531 --> 03:51.597
I'll stay and be a body
in the room for her.

03:51.599 --> 03:54.633
Adult adam: <i> And go we did,</i>
<i> but not to tennis</i>
<i> or a museum, no.</i>

03:54.635 --> 03:58.637
<i> ¶ you got the touch</i>
<i> we headed to the south jersey</i>
<i> gem known as atlantic city.</i>

03:58.639 --> 04:02.641
<i> ¶ you got the power</i>
<i> back then, it was a sketchy,</i>
<i> degenerate wonderland</i>

04:02.643 --> 04:05.811
<i> Where they actually let in</i>
<i> a baby-faced boy like me...</i>

04:05.813 --> 04:07.012
<i> No questions asked.</i>

04:07.014 --> 04:09.815
<i> Pops' game of choice</i>
<i> was craps.</i>

04:09.817 --> 04:11.116
<i> And although no human</i>
<i> could understand it,</i>

04:11.118 --> 04:13.151
<i> All I knew was that</i>
<i> as long as my grandfather</i>

04:13.153 --> 04:15.954
<i> Had his lucky watch,</i>
<i> the man was unstoppable.</i>
<i> ¶ you're a winner</i>

04:15.956 --> 04:20.826
<i> ¶ you got the touch ¶</i>
dealer: Seven out.
Seven out.

04:21.027 --> 04:22.127
Is that bad?

04:22.129 --> 04:22.761
Oh, not for us.

04:22.763 --> 04:26.632
I dropped a c-note
on the come
at the last second,

04:26.634 --> 04:27.833
So now we're up 50.

04:27.835 --> 04:30.369
My god,
even when you lose you win.

04:30.371 --> 04:33.472
Here you go, al.
Seafood buffet on us.

04:33.474 --> 04:35.641
Free all-you-can-eat
popcorn shrimp?

04:35.643 --> 04:38.410
Seriously, how
does this casino
stay in business?

04:38.412 --> 04:40.912
<i> As I was living it up</i>
<i> with my hero,</i>

04:40.914 --> 04:42.481
<i> Barry was beyond desperate</i>

04:42.483 --> 04:45.484
<i> To no longer be</i>
<i> the crusty eyed zero.</i>

04:45.486 --> 04:47.819
Yo! Big "e"!

04:47.821 --> 04:48.987
Siblings, am I right?

04:48.989 --> 04:50.389
You can't
come with us.

04:50.391 --> 04:51.423
Just hear me out.

04:51.425 --> 04:54.893
<i> Dance party usa</i>
is the one chance I get

04:54.895 --> 04:55.661
To show everyone
at school

04:55.663 --> 04:57.529
That I'm not just
a pink-eyed loser

04:57.531 --> 04:59.965
Dating some girl
out of his league.

04:59.967 --> 05:01.667
They'll have to
respect the guy

05:01.669 --> 05:03.935
Who danced briefly
on local television.

05:03.937 --> 05:05.904
I'm begging you
with all my heart.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.739
Please do this for me.

05:07.840 --> 05:10.075
I'm glad you came to me
with this,

05:10.077 --> 05:11.510
And I really appreciate
your honesty.

05:11.512 --> 05:14.179
And now I hope,
you can appreciate mine.

05:14.181 --> 05:15.380
I think you're unappealing
and gross.

05:15.382 --> 05:20.085
Adult adam: <i> Barry knew</i>
<i> no amount of begging</i>
<i> could change erica's mind.</i>

05:20.087 --> 05:25.490
<i> What he didn't know</i>
<i> was that pink eye</i>
<i> is highly contagious.</i>

05:25.492 --> 05:26.892
(school bell rings)
ahhh!

05:26.894 --> 05:28.226
What's happening
on your face?

05:28.228 --> 05:30.128
I caught barry's
gross pink eye.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.163
I can't
wear my contacts.

05:31.165 --> 05:33.932
At all? We're supposed
to be on tv in three days.

05:33.934 --> 05:35.600
Move it, lainey.
Get to class.

05:35.602 --> 05:38.704
Ugh. Take mrs. Magoo
with you.

05:38.838 --> 05:41.273
Don't worry, lainey.
I'll look fine for tv.

05:41.275 --> 05:42.841
These are just
reading glasses.

05:42.843 --> 05:45.610
I don't need them
to see.

05:45.612 --> 05:47.079
(clang)

05:47.081 --> 05:47.579
Ahhh!

05:47.581 --> 05:49.214
How did you
not see that?

05:49.216 --> 05:52.417
'cause I lied!
I want to dance on tv!

05:52.419 --> 05:53.552
Walk it off,
goldberg.

05:53.554 --> 05:54.753
Adult adam:
<i> As erica was headed</i>

05:54.755 --> 05:56.188
<i> For an emergency</i>
<i> dental procedure,</i>

05:56.190 --> 05:58.023
<i> Pops and I</i>
<i> were headed home winners.</i>

05:58.025 --> 06:00.926
That's another one
for the record books.

06:00.928 --> 06:04.563
Here's your taste
of the action, kiddo.

06:04.565 --> 06:06.131
Always a pleasure.

06:06.133 --> 06:07.099
Me too, pops.

06:07.101 --> 06:08.600
I'm just hoping
one of these days,

06:08.602 --> 06:10.702
Some of your awesomeness
will rub off on me.

06:10.704 --> 06:13.638
What are you talking about?
You're plenty awesome.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.206
Not like you.

06:14.208 --> 06:17.042
Your life is a parade
of money, free shrimp,

06:17.044 --> 06:20.379
And old ladies
that you find hot
and I find sad.

06:20.381 --> 06:22.614
You're the luckiest guy
I know.

06:22.616 --> 06:23.215
It's like magic.

06:23.217 --> 06:25.050
Trust me,
you have it in you, too.

06:25.052 --> 06:27.552
Really? 'cause my life
hasn't been magical at all.

06:27.554 --> 06:30.288
Even at magic camp,
I was a total third-stringer.

06:30.290 --> 06:33.792
All the magic you need
is right in here.

06:33.794 --> 06:37.729
If you just
believe in yourself
like I do...

06:37.731 --> 06:38.330
You can't lose.

06:38.332 --> 06:40.632
Adult adam:
<i> After pops made me realize</i>
<i> I was a winner,</i>

06:40.634 --> 06:44.503
<i> I tested my gambling skills</i>
<i> at the riskiest game</i>
<i> in town...</i>

06:44.505 --> 06:45.070
<i> Finger football.</i>

06:45.072 --> 06:46.738
What do you say
we make this interesting?
Fine.

06:46.740 --> 06:48.807
The big boys play
for lunch snacks.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.709
What did your hot mom
pack for dessert today?

06:50.711 --> 06:51.476
She is hot, dude.

06:51.478 --> 06:53.545
Dave kim
likes an hourglass shape.

06:53.547 --> 06:55.881
Harkens back
to old hollywood.

06:55.883 --> 06:56.948
Shut up, dave kim.

06:56.950 --> 06:58.817
And lunch snacks
are adorable,

06:58.819 --> 07:03.054
But I say we play
for your <i> hulk</i> issue 181.

07:03.056 --> 07:03.755
What are you offering?

07:03.757 --> 07:05.290
Let me just whip out
my money clip here.

07:05.292 --> 07:09.294
How's about every series 1
<i> garbage pail kid</i> I got.

07:09.296 --> 07:10.395
Big mistake, goldberg.

07:10.397 --> 07:12.264
The mistake is yours,
bro.

07:12.266 --> 07:13.532
<i> ¶ you got the touch</i>
adult adam: <i> This was it.</i>

07:13.534 --> 07:15.467
<i> Thanks to pops,</i>
<i> I knew I had</i>
<i> the magic touch...</i>

07:15.469 --> 07:18.403
<i> ¶ you got the power ¶</i>
<i> and nothing</i>
<i> could stop my luck.</i>

07:18.405 --> 07:19.771
(music stops)
(sighs)

07:19.773 --> 07:22.040
Nice doing business
with you.
Wait.

07:22.042 --> 07:23.241
You can't
just walk away now.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.777
Double or nothing.
I'm listening.

07:25.779 --> 07:27.379
I bet my megatron.

07:27.381 --> 07:29.281
I bet all my robots.

07:29.283 --> 07:32.617
My entire
nintendo system.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.686
All my games.

07:34.688 --> 07:36.354
Is my soul
worth anything?

07:36.356 --> 07:38.056
(all groan)

07:38.758 --> 07:40.158
It's gone.

07:40.160 --> 07:41.359
It's all gone.

07:41.361 --> 07:43.161
Walk it off, goldberg.

07:43.163 --> 07:45.597
Adult adam: <i> And so ended</i>
<i> the worst losing streak</i>

07:45.599 --> 07:47.299
<i> In finger football history.</i>

07:47.301 --> 07:49.367
What are you doing
sitting in the dark?

07:49.369 --> 07:50.635
I had a terrible day.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.737
I gambled pretty bad,
and I lost.

07:52.739 --> 07:55.140
Well, hey,
that's why you always keep

07:55.142 --> 07:58.310
A spare pair of underpants
in your locker.

07:58.312 --> 07:59.044
That gem's for free.

07:59.046 --> 08:02.881
No! I lost my toys
to garry ball
playing finger football.

08:02.883 --> 08:07.285
Pops convinced me
that I was lucky like him,
but I'm not.

08:07.287 --> 08:10.422
I found this guy
trying to hide under my bed.

08:10.424 --> 08:12.858
I know you're scared,
starscream.

08:12.860 --> 08:13.625
So am I.

08:13.627 --> 08:14.860
I'm not sure
what I'm watching here,

08:14.862 --> 08:16.761
But at least you learned
a valuable lesson.

08:16.763 --> 08:18.296
All gamblers
eventually lose.

08:18.298 --> 08:20.665
Not pops. He always wins.
It's like the man's magic.

08:20.667 --> 08:24.135
Except he does lose,
and there's no such thing
as magic.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.137
You do know that,
right?
So...

08:26.139 --> 08:30.542
You're saying my hero
is just a regular old man

08:30.544 --> 08:32.744
And there really is
no magic in the world?

08:32.746 --> 08:36.047
Yes.
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

08:36.049 --> 08:36.715
Don't listen to him.

08:36.717 --> 08:38.950
You just continue loving pops
the way you always have.

08:38.952 --> 08:42.287
Your dad's the reason
he gambled
all his stuff away.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.388
Well,
then pops will fix it.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.856
I'll take him
down to the school,

08:44.858 --> 08:46.658
He'll work
his magical magic,

08:46.660 --> 08:48.393
And get it all back
for you.

08:48.395 --> 08:49.294
Really?
Really.

08:49.296 --> 08:50.395
Really?
Really.

08:50.397 --> 08:53.231
Adult adam: <i> And with that,</i>
<i> my mom rushed off</i>

08:53.233 --> 08:56.101
<i> To settle</i>
<i> my gambling debts.</i>

08:57.136 --> 08:59.404
...19, 20.

08:59.406 --> 09:01.206
All right.
(blows whistle)

09:01.208 --> 09:01.806
Hit the showers.

09:01.808 --> 09:06.244
And don't wear
your underwear in there
like a bunch of weirdos.

09:06.246 --> 09:06.611
Coach.

09:06.613 --> 09:08.747
I'm kind of going through
some personal stuff.

09:08.749 --> 09:09.881
Do you have time
to talk?

09:09.883 --> 09:12.350
I'm not just your
wrestling coach,
goldberg.

09:12.352 --> 09:13.552
I'm your life coach.

09:13.554 --> 09:14.953
Now drop
and give me feelings.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.254
Everyone in school
thinks I'm a joke.

09:16.256 --> 09:18.156
Maybe, I am.
I can't change that.

09:18.158 --> 09:20.525
But being on tv
is a game changer.

09:20.527 --> 09:22.060
I was thinking
if someone taught me

09:22.062 --> 09:23.161
Some sweet
dance moves,

09:23.163 --> 09:25.664
Maybe everyone
would look past
who I really am.

09:25.666 --> 09:27.032
Why you coming to me
for this?

09:27.034 --> 09:28.633
I remember you told me
you took up tap dancing

09:28.635 --> 09:31.202
To help you with your
balance and flexibility.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.438
Not true.
Tap is for wuss-bags.

09:33.440 --> 09:35.507
I took modern.
It's a man's dance.

09:35.509 --> 09:38.310
So... Maybe,
you can help me?
Okay, son.

09:38.312 --> 09:41.580
I'm gonna tell you
the same thing I told
my ex-wife's lawyer...

09:41.582 --> 09:44.349
You better bring
everything you got.

09:44.351 --> 09:44.883
Let's dance.

09:44.885 --> 09:47.686
Adult adam: <i> And with that,</i>
<i> coach mellor would train barry</i>

09:47.688 --> 09:49.688
<i> To dance his way</i>
<i> to local tv stardom.</i>

09:49.690 --> 09:51.122
<i> ¶ you got the touch</i>
<i> with moves this flawless,</i>

09:51.124 --> 09:52.857
<i> Erica and lainey</i>
<i> would have no choice</i>
<i> but to...</i>

09:52.859 --> 09:55.594
<i> But to look past the pink</i>
<i> in barry's eye</i>
<i> ¶ you got the power</i>

09:55.596 --> 09:59.064
<i> And into the fire</i>
<i> in his heart.</i>

09:59.066 --> 10:00.498
<i> ¶ oh</i>

10:00.500 --> 10:03.835
<i> ¶ after all is said and done</i>

10:03.837 --> 10:07.505
<i> ¶ you've never walked</i>
<i> you've never run</i>

10:07.507 --> 10:10.542
<i> ¶ you're a winner</i>

10:11.277 --> 10:14.446
<i> ¶ you're at your best</i>
<i> when the going gets rough</i>

10:14.448 --> 10:20.051
<i> ¶ you've been put to the test</i>
<i> but it's never enough</i>

10:20.053 --> 10:22.554
<i> ¶ you got the touch</i>

10:24.557 --> 10:27.592
<i> ¶ you got the power ¶</i>

10:28.928 --> 10:30.061
Oh, my god,
it's midnight.

10:30.063 --> 10:34.833
Mellor: Welcome to
the first midnight
of the rest of your life...

10:34.835 --> 10:38.103
(groans)
'cause I taught you
to dance.

10:38.105 --> 10:38.536
And now...

10:38.538 --> 10:41.406
You will succeed
at the thing
you wanted.

10:41.408 --> 10:42.040
Whatever that was.

10:42.042 --> 10:43.775
Adult adam: <i> While barry</i>
<i> had some new sweet moves,</i>

10:43.777 --> 10:46.778
<i> My mom was using</i>
<i> some old ones</i>
<i> on principal ball.</i>

10:46.780 --> 10:48.313
Thank you for agreeing
to meet with me

10:48.315 --> 10:49.914
On such short notice,
earl.

10:49.916 --> 10:51.549
You're welcome,
but technically,

10:51.551 --> 10:52.717
You just pounded
on the door

10:52.719 --> 10:54.019
While I tried
to hold my breath

10:54.021 --> 10:55.453
Until you heard me
gasp for air,

10:55.455 --> 10:56.755
Then you barged
right in.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.523
Look, I know you're
in a tough position

10:58.525 --> 11:01.593
Being both principal
and garry's father,

11:01.595 --> 11:03.728
But something
very upsetting

11:03.730 --> 11:05.230
Has happened
between our boys.

11:05.232 --> 11:08.967
The finger football fiasco.
I am so sorry.

11:08.969 --> 11:11.403
I told garry,
gambling in school

11:11.405 --> 11:12.671
Will never
be tolerated again.

11:12.673 --> 11:15.640
So, I'll just swing by later
and pick up adam's toys?

11:15.642 --> 11:17.409
Oh, gosh no.
Garry won them in a bet.

11:17.411 --> 11:18.677
So they're
his toys now.

11:18.679 --> 11:22.447
But you just said
gambling at school
was unacceptable.

11:22.449 --> 11:23.048
Completely.

11:23.050 --> 11:25.884
However, welching
on a gentleman's wager
is even worse.

11:25.886 --> 11:29.154
That is an important
life lesson for our boys
to learn.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.423
But I think
the takeaway here is,

11:31.425 --> 11:32.891
You never bet
against a ball.

11:32.893 --> 11:34.459
Oh, is that
the takeaway?

11:34.461 --> 11:35.894
We're an unusually
lucky brood.

11:35.896 --> 11:39.497
Well, why not put your money
where your mouth is, ball?

11:39.499 --> 11:40.398
Meaning?
You may be lucky,

11:40.400 --> 11:44.502
But when it comes
to beverly goldberg's
love of her children,

11:44.504 --> 11:45.403
She never loses.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.073
If I win,
I get adam's things back.

11:48.075 --> 11:48.673
If I lose...

11:48.675 --> 11:51.476
I'll stay out of your office
for a week.

11:51.478 --> 11:54.345
(drawer opens)
(drawer closes)

11:57.450 --> 12:01.720
Mississippi stud, deuces
and one-eyed jacks are wild.

12:01.722 --> 12:02.520
I only know
the... The game

12:02.522 --> 12:05.090
Where you do
the flippy thing
with the card

12:05.092 --> 12:06.424
And the highest one wins.

12:06.426 --> 12:09.494
You want war?
You got it.

12:09.496 --> 12:10.495
Ace.
Two!

12:10.497 --> 12:12.797
Damn it!
Double or nothing.

12:12.799 --> 12:14.799
King.
Two!

12:14.801 --> 12:15.500
Damn it!

12:15.502 --> 12:17.635
Shall we go
for a year?

12:17.837 --> 12:20.805
How did it go, bev?
Did you strong-arm him
or what?

12:20.807 --> 12:21.940
I'll explain
in the car.

12:21.942 --> 12:24.309
I'm not allowed
on school grounds
for the next decade.

12:24.311 --> 12:27.846
Hold on. Let me just go in
and charm the man.

12:27.848 --> 12:28.847
It's my thing.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.950
Okay, fine,
but listen to me
very carefully.

12:31.952 --> 12:35.887
Under no circumstances
are you to play war.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.323
What happened
to your jacket?

12:38.325 --> 12:39.023
(bleep) that guy.

12:39.025 --> 12:41.860
Adult adam:
<i> While pops and my mom</i>
<i> needed a new plan</i>

12:41.862 --> 12:42.961
<i> To get back</i>
<i> my prized possessions,</i>

12:42.963 --> 12:46.631
<i> Barry planned</i>
<i> to win over lainey</i>
<i> with his new dance moves.</i>

12:46.633 --> 12:48.967
(sneakers squeak)
oh, hello.

12:48.969 --> 12:50.602
Barry? (chuckles)

12:50.604 --> 12:52.871
Uh, what are you doing?

12:53.773 --> 12:55.540
Now finish it.

12:58.110 --> 13:00.044
I can't believe
I'm saying this,

13:00.046 --> 13:01.446
But that was kind of hot.

13:01.448 --> 13:02.814
Welcome to
the new barry,

13:02.816 --> 13:05.717
And the new barry's
been working
on his moves.

13:05.719 --> 13:06.718
Hmm.
What's up, gang?

13:06.720 --> 13:08.086
(both screaming)
(lisping) I know.

13:08.088 --> 13:10.321
I messed my teeth up
when my face hit that locker

13:10.323 --> 13:13.191
So dr. Chang put me
in some temporary braces.

13:13.193 --> 13:16.127
Did dr. Chang
do something
to your hair, too?

13:16.129 --> 13:19.664
Oh, no, I tried
to cheer myself up
with a home perm, but...

13:19.666 --> 13:23.601
I can't see good,
so...Yeah.

13:23.603 --> 13:24.202
Well, good news is,

13:24.204 --> 13:25.703
The whole package
kind of goes together.
(chuckles)

13:25.705 --> 13:29.774
Yeah, you have this whole
cat lady drifter thing
going on.

13:29.776 --> 13:31.009
Shut up, will ya?

13:31.011 --> 13:33.411
I'll totally be camera-ready
by tomorrow.

13:33.413 --> 13:34.979
Uh, in light of your recent
medical issues,

13:34.981 --> 13:36.181
Maybe I should just go
with barry instead?

13:36.183 --> 13:39.217
No. Barry, you're my brother.
Talk some sense into her.

13:39.219 --> 13:41.186
Do you want her
to go like this?

13:41.188 --> 13:42.687
No.
I'm sorry.

13:42.689 --> 13:43.421
I did everything
I could.

13:43.423 --> 13:47.192
Fine! I don't want to go to
the stupid dance party anyway.

13:47.194 --> 13:51.729
I'll just eat my soft foods
and go, hmm?

13:53.799 --> 13:55.333
Dang it,
where's the pudding?

13:55.335 --> 13:57.468
Sorry, we're all out.
Got some pears, though.

13:57.470 --> 13:59.771
I don't want a pear.
I want chocolate.

13:59.773 --> 14:02.106
Again,
we have no pudding.

14:02.108 --> 14:02.841
We have pears.

14:02.843 --> 14:05.376
Fine. You want me
to take a damn pear?

14:05.378 --> 14:07.378
Then I'll take
all the pears, woman.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.848
That way,
you'll run out of pears

14:09.850 --> 14:11.349
Instead of pudding!

14:11.351 --> 14:12.617
Adult adam:
<i> For the first time,</i>

14:12.619 --> 14:15.854
<i> Erica got a taste of what</i>
<i> it was like to be her brother.</i>
Oh, my.

14:15.856 --> 14:16.354
Yeah!

14:16.356 --> 14:17.922
<i> But none of barry's</i>
<i> public meltdowns</i>

14:17.924 --> 14:21.359
<i> Ever rivaled my sister's</i>
<i> pear-throwing, pudding rant.</i>

14:21.361 --> 14:22.594
Huh?
Everyone gets a pear!

14:22.596 --> 14:25.997
All right, show's over!
My office!
(erica screams)

14:25.999 --> 14:27.432
(shoes squeaking)

14:27.434 --> 14:28.633
Whoa!

14:28.635 --> 14:29.067
(thud)

14:29.069 --> 14:31.870
Oh!
Ooh, that's gonna be
a tough one to walk off.

14:31.872 --> 14:34.172
<i> While erica was forced</i>
<i> into detention,</i>

14:34.174 --> 14:35.840
<i> I was forced</i>
<i> to entertain myself</i>

14:35.842 --> 14:38.109
<i> With my backup toys</i>
<i> form the '70s.</i>

14:38.111 --> 14:41.312
Big news, little man.
Guess who just won

14:41.314 --> 14:42.714
All your toys back.

14:42.716 --> 14:43.281
It was me.

14:43.283 --> 14:47.085
Yeah, I did exactly whatever
she's about to tell you.

14:47.087 --> 14:47.819
Really? How?

14:47.821 --> 14:50.054
Specifics
aren't important.
(chuckles)

14:50.056 --> 14:53.258
What matters is that pops
once again saved the day.

14:53.260 --> 14:54.859
That's why
he's your hero.

14:54.861 --> 14:56.761
He really is.

15:00.499 --> 15:01.566
What the hell
is this?

15:01.568 --> 15:04.369
Oh, that's one of those,
uh, robo change 'em ups

15:04.371 --> 15:05.536
You love so much.

15:05.538 --> 15:06.437
This is a gobot.

15:06.439 --> 15:08.940
I gambled away
all my transformers.

15:08.942 --> 15:11.476
And the difference
would be?

15:11.478 --> 15:13.778
This is a transformer...

15:13.780 --> 15:15.647
And this is a gobot.

15:15.649 --> 15:16.547
Look at the obvious
difference.

15:16.549 --> 15:19.651
Forget about the robots.
Look what you've got here.

15:19.653 --> 15:21.219
(singsong)
nintardo!

15:21.221 --> 15:22.620
What did
you just call me?

15:22.622 --> 15:24.889
No, it's the thing you play
all day long... Nintardo.

15:24.891 --> 15:27.859
Oh, my god,
are you combining
nintendo and atari

15:27.861 --> 15:29.994
Into some horrible
mom word?

15:29.996 --> 15:30.662
Bev, enough.

15:30.664 --> 15:33.798
It's time we just
level with the kid.

15:34.233 --> 15:35.600
I, uh...

15:35.602 --> 15:38.636
May have gone
to the toy store
to replace your toys.

15:38.638 --> 15:42.106
Pops, why couldn't you
just win it all back for me?

15:42.108 --> 15:43.574
That's the thing.
Over the years,

15:43.576 --> 15:45.810
I may have fudged
a few details

15:45.812 --> 15:47.111
About how much
I've won.

15:47.113 --> 15:48.780
What are you
talking about?

15:48.782 --> 15:50.415
I've see you win
so much at casinos,

15:50.417 --> 15:52.884
They shower you
with the freshest seafood

15:52.886 --> 15:53.551
The ocean has to offer.

15:53.553 --> 15:57.488
First of all,
that seafood is both frozen

15:57.490 --> 15:58.523
And of
the lowest quality.

15:58.525 --> 16:02.193
And they give it to you
when you bet aggressively
and lose.

16:02.195 --> 16:06.564
So, have you been fudging
other things, too?

16:06.566 --> 16:08.066
No... Maybe.

16:08.068 --> 16:10.168
What about
all your legendary
war stories?

16:10.170 --> 16:12.070
Are those true?
Well, mostly.

16:12.072 --> 16:14.539
Did you karate-kick
mussolini in the face?

16:14.541 --> 16:17.608
No, but I was
a very outspoken critic.

16:17.610 --> 16:18.176
Unbelievable.

16:18.178 --> 16:20.845
My whole life,
I thought that
you were special.

16:20.847 --> 16:23.514
But you're
just a liar.

16:27.086 --> 16:29.687
Adult adam:
<i> It had been an hour</i>
<i> since erica's meltdown,</i>

16:29.689 --> 16:31.656
<i> And she was feeling</i>
<i> the pain.</i>

16:31.658 --> 16:32.457
This is a nightmare.

16:32.459 --> 16:37.128
Well, why don't you
let coach buck you up
with a little story?

16:37.130 --> 16:37.695
Please don't.

16:37.697 --> 16:39.764
It's about an awkward
and goofy-looking
caterpillar.

16:39.766 --> 16:43.368
She had heart,
she had spirit,
but nobody saw it

16:43.370 --> 16:47.705
Because on the outside,
she had wild hair
and a jacked-up eye.

16:47.707 --> 16:49.374
You're clearly talking
about me.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.709
No, I'm talking
about a caterpillar.

16:51.711 --> 16:53.911
I'm clearly
the caterpillar.

16:53.913 --> 16:57.682
Anyway, this caterpillar,
who is not you,

16:57.684 --> 16:59.684
Eventually spun herself

16:59.686 --> 17:02.253
A little cocoon
of confidence.

17:02.354 --> 17:03.921
And then...

17:04.023 --> 17:05.123
Poof

17:05.125 --> 17:08.559
What emerged was but
a beautiful butterfly.

17:08.561 --> 17:09.961
Oh, my god!

17:09.963 --> 17:11.129
Y-you're giving me
the uggo speech.

17:11.131 --> 17:14.298
That's the same story
you tell all the dorks
and losers.

17:14.300 --> 17:15.433
Wait,
people know this?

17:15.435 --> 17:18.403
I know it,
'cause you gave it
to me in ninth grade.

17:18.405 --> 17:22.006
Really? That's a heck
of a long time
to be in a cocoon.

17:22.008 --> 17:23.408
I'm a butterfly!

17:23.410 --> 17:25.643
I'm just going through
some stuff, okay?

17:25.645 --> 17:27.545
Well, then,
let me tell you
another story

17:27.547 --> 17:29.480
About a lady
who never got married,

17:29.482 --> 17:32.216
But she became
one heck of a cool aunt.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.851
I'm a butterfly.

17:33.853 --> 17:35.720
Yes, you are...

17:35.722 --> 17:37.789
Under your skin.

17:38.023 --> 17:40.625
Here's a pudding.
Thought you could use it.

17:40.627 --> 17:44.829
Just go away.
I don't want
your pity pudding.

17:45.097 --> 17:47.065
Damn it.
Yes, I do.

17:50.069 --> 17:51.536
Okay,
I talked to lainey,

17:51.538 --> 17:55.106
And we want you
to come with us
to <i> dance party usa.</i>

17:55.108 --> 17:57.108
I can't go on tv
looking like this.

17:57.110 --> 17:59.677
I can't even go out
in the world like this.

17:59.679 --> 18:00.878
Trust me, you can.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.046
How would you know?

18:02.048 --> 18:03.448
Honestly?

18:03.450 --> 18:03.981
This...

18:03.983 --> 18:05.883
Is what I feel like
every day.

18:05.885 --> 18:09.420
When I saw you freaking out
in the cafeteria, I saw me.

18:09.422 --> 18:13.791
And I realized,
I never want to see you
feel that way again.

18:13.793 --> 18:15.693
Why are you being
so nice to me?

18:15.695 --> 18:17.795
'cause no matter
how scary you look,

18:17.797 --> 18:19.163
You'll always be
my big sister.

18:19.165 --> 18:21.699
(sobbing)
that's just so nice.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.367
Oh, god,
don't hug me.

18:23.369 --> 18:24.502
<i> ¶ highway run</i>
ooh, I need to hug you.

18:24.504 --> 18:27.505
Adult adam:
<i> Sure, erica and barry</i>
<i> never really saw eye-to-eye.</i>

18:27.507 --> 18:29.540
<i> ¶ into the midnight sun</i>
<i> but for the first time,</i>

18:29.542 --> 18:31.642
<i> They saw each other</i>
<i> clearer than ever.</i>

18:31.644 --> 18:33.978
<i> ¶ wheels go 'round and 'round</i>
murray:
Oh, look at you.

18:33.980 --> 18:35.179
You got all your
crap back.

18:35.181 --> 18:37.048
Only 'cause I agreed
to give garry

18:37.050 --> 18:39.650
All of my desserts at lunch
until we graduate.

18:39.652 --> 18:42.887
You know, you were right.
Pops isn't a hero.

18:42.889 --> 18:45.356
He's a fraud.
That's not what I meant.

18:45.358 --> 18:48.025
Listen,
pops may not be magic,

18:48.027 --> 18:49.894
But he's
a terrific grandfather

18:49.896 --> 18:51.662
And he's always
there for you.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.065
But he still
lied to me.

18:54.067 --> 18:55.066
He exaggerated.

18:55.068 --> 18:57.401
That's what
all grandfathers do.

18:57.403 --> 18:58.269
You know why?

18:58.271 --> 19:00.605
'cause they want you
to love them

19:00.607 --> 19:01.372
As much as they love you.

19:01.374 --> 19:06.144
Adult adam: <i> Thanks to my dad,</i>
<i> I realized that pops</i>
<i> wasn't the lucky one.</i>

19:06.146 --> 19:09.113
<i> I was for having him</i>
<i> in my life.</i>

19:09.115 --> 19:10.481
Hey, pops, what's with
the bran cereal?

19:10.483 --> 19:14.552
Don't you want to
hit the waffle house
and the museum?

19:14.554 --> 19:14.952
Always.

19:14.954 --> 19:18.656
I...I just assumed
you didn't want
to go with me anymore.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.857
Just do me a favor

19:19.859 --> 19:22.960
And give it to me straight
from here on out.

19:22.962 --> 19:23.761
Deal.

19:23.763 --> 19:25.363
And I'm gonna start

19:25.365 --> 19:26.898
By giving you this.

19:26.900 --> 19:29.634
<i> ¶ I'm forever yours</i>
my grandpa gave it to me,

19:29.636 --> 19:33.971
And now I carry him
with me wherever I go.

19:34.540 --> 19:35.706
Now...

19:35.708 --> 19:38.676
You'll carry me
with you.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.978
And if that ain't magic,
I don't know what is.

19:40.980 --> 19:44.015
Adult adam: <i> When you're young,</i>
<i> it's easy to believe in magic.</i>

19:44.017 --> 19:44.582
Come on, kid.

19:44.584 --> 19:46.918
Beverly: Have fun
with your grandfather.

19:46.920 --> 19:49.353
Oh, and no atlantic city!

19:49.355 --> 19:51.322
That's right!
I know!

19:51.324 --> 19:52.056
<i> But as you get older,</i>

19:52.058 --> 19:56.360
<i> You realize the real magic</i>
<i> comes from the people</i>
<i> you love.</i>

20:00.065 --> 20:02.466
<i> ¶ faithfully</i>

20:03.635 --> 20:07.872
<i> ¶ I'm still yours ¶</i>

20:08.740 --> 20:10.541
Adult adam: <i> Truth is,</i>
<i> your greatest memories</i>

20:10.543 --> 20:14.011
<i> Are always the ones</i>
<i> with family at your side.</i>

20:14.013 --> 20:15.046
<i> Sure, they may not be pretty</i>

20:15.048 --> 20:16.047
<i> Or turn out</i>
<i> exactly as you planned.</i>

20:16.049 --> 20:19.283
<i> In fact, some of our</i>
<i> most embarrassing moments</i>

20:19.285 --> 20:21.619
<i> Lead to our</i>
<i> greatest victories.</i>

20:21.621 --> 20:26.023
<i> Of course, at the time,</i>
<i> it may not seem that way.</i>

20:26.025 --> 20:29.393
<i> It's only when you sit down</i>
<i> and take a good look back</i>

20:29.395 --> 20:30.695
<i> That you can't help</i>
<i> but smile</i>

20:30.697 --> 20:32.730
<i> 'cause it's those</i>
<i> very flaws...</i>
(both laugh)

20:32.732 --> 20:37.835
<i> That make the memories</i>
<i> absolutely perfect.</i>
(chuckles)

20:52.818 --> 20:54.352
(indistinct conversations)

20:54.354 --> 20:56.187
Happy to report
the dorks and dinks

20:56.189 --> 20:57.989
Are afraid
to talk to me again.

20:57.991 --> 20:59.023
All is right
with the world.

20:59.025 --> 21:00.491
Well, now that you've been
on the other side,

21:00.493 --> 21:01.659
Maybe you'll have pity
for them.

21:01.661 --> 21:04.262
(scoffs)
lainey:
What's up, gang?

21:04.264 --> 21:05.363
Oh my!
Whoa!

21:05.365 --> 21:08.165
Got your stupid pink eye...
In both eyes.

21:08.167 --> 21:10.201
And I was so upset
I threw my hair dryer

21:10.203 --> 21:11.035
Against the wall
and broke it.

21:11.037 --> 21:14.205
Now I'm so stressed,
I think I may be getting
a little pimple.

21:14.207 --> 21:14.772
Am I?

21:14.774 --> 21:16.507
There might be
something coming in.

21:16.509 --> 21:17.975
(sighs)
I'm so sorry, barry.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.077
If you don't want
to be seen with me,
I totally get it.

21:20.079 --> 21:22.947
I'm not gonna lie.
I'm super into this.

21:22.949 --> 21:24.548
I love dating
a weirdo.

21:24.550 --> 21:26.550
That's right you do.
