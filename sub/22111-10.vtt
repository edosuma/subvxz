WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:06.807
(indistinct chatter)

00:06.840 --> 00:09.543
Get home safe
and go to bed.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.045
How about you join me?

00:11.079 --> 00:12.680
(chuckling):
Nice try, kid.

00:12.713 --> 00:15.249
Ellie, come on, when are
you gonna make a man out of me?

00:15.283 --> 00:17.118
Get home safe
and make yourself a man.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.186
What?

00:18.219 --> 00:19.687
You're gonna miss your Uber.

00:19.720 --> 00:21.289
Ellie, I love you.

00:21.322 --> 00:23.257
Night!
I love you.

00:23.291 --> 00:25.426
* Ooh, baby

00:25.459 --> 00:29.163
We're just about
to close up here.

00:29.197 --> 00:31.699
You got a ride home?

00:31.732 --> 00:35.236
I'm not feeling
too good.

00:35.269 --> 00:37.371
Can you show me
the restroom?

00:37.405 --> 00:39.840
Hold that thought.

00:39.873 --> 00:41.709
Last call, guys!

00:41.742 --> 00:44.712
Gentlemen!

00:44.745 --> 00:46.714
Don't mind me.
I've only been getting

00:46.747 --> 00:48.516
your damn rum and Cokes
all night.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.318
All right, sweetie, let's roll.

00:50.351 --> 00:52.220
Come on.

00:52.253 --> 00:55.223
Goodness. Keep it classy.

00:55.256 --> 00:57.691
Come on. I got you.

00:59.260 --> 01:01.262
(clacking)

01:02.596 --> 01:05.833
("Tequila" remix playing)

01:11.772 --> 01:13.341
(grunts)
I'm so sorry.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.442
It's fine.

01:14.475 --> 01:16.444
Have we met before?

01:16.477 --> 01:17.845
No.

01:17.878 --> 01:21.549
Your loss.

01:21.582 --> 01:23.251
(grunts)

01:23.284 --> 01:25.253
Damn it.
Let's go.

01:25.286 --> 01:27.621
Go ahead. I'll get this.

01:27.655 --> 01:29.623
*

01:29.657 --> 01:30.824
* Tequila

01:30.858 --> 01:32.193
(screaming)

01:36.330 --> 01:38.699
(grunting)

01:38.732 --> 01:40.668
(shouting)

01:40.701 --> 01:42.703
(snap)

01:42.736 --> 01:44.272
*

01:58.586 --> 02:00.588
(rapid beeping)

02:01.289 --> 02:04.292
* Tequila!

02:05.526 --> 02:07.695
*

02:25.946 --> 02:28.382
No, no.
That-That's a terrible idea.

02:28.416 --> 02:30.551
Just don-don't go
to the precinct.

02:30.584 --> 02:32.386
Okay. Yeah, I'll come...
I'll come meet you.

02:32.420 --> 02:34.522
Okay.
What's going on?

02:34.555 --> 02:36.890
That is a full,
hands-on-deck crisis.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.526
Whose crisis?

02:38.559 --> 02:40.828
If I tell you, will you promise
to cover for me today?

02:40.861 --> 02:42.296
Not until you
tell me what it is.

02:42.330 --> 02:43.564
It's guy. Actually,

02:43.597 --> 02:45.699
it's Guy. It's my mom's guy Guy.

02:45.733 --> 02:47.301
Her special friend.
Do you remember him?

02:47.335 --> 02:50.304
Mm-hmm.
It turns out he got himself
mugged this morning.

02:50.338 --> 02:51.305
Lost his bag

02:51.339 --> 02:52.640
and his laptop.

02:52.673 --> 02:53.841
Shouldn't we call your mom?

02:53.874 --> 02:54.708
Uh, he doesn't want us to.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.644
'Cause he doesn't want her
to worry.

02:56.677 --> 02:58.912
Huh.
Huh.

02:58.946 --> 03:02.583
Why would she be worried
about his bag being stolen?

03:02.616 --> 03:04.418
Oh, no.

03:04.452 --> 03:05.586
What?

03:05.619 --> 03:07.788
What if there's, like,

03:07.821 --> 03:10.891
pictures of my mom
on his computer?

03:10.924 --> 03:12.726
Deeks, really? Your mom?

03:12.760 --> 03:14.862
Yeah, my mom. We're not talking
about your sweet mom.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.597
We're talking
about Crazy Bertie.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.632
Oh, you better find that laptop.

03:18.666 --> 03:20.968
Yeah. That's exactly why you got
to cover for me.

03:21.001 --> 03:23.003
(chuckles): No. 'Cause
what if Mosley finds out?

03:23.036 --> 03:24.505
She can't.

03:24.538 --> 03:26.307
Right. Because we would lose
our jobs.

03:26.340 --> 03:27.941
Which is why
you're covering for me.
I am not

03:27.975 --> 03:29.743
covering for you, Deeks.
My God, look at you,

03:29.777 --> 03:31.512
so adorable when you're angry.
No.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.747
What? (blubbering)
No. No puppy eyes.
Don't do this.

03:33.781 --> 03:36.584
No. Don't do this, Deeks.
S-Seriously. Li...

03:36.617 --> 03:37.985
Hey, I hate you!
Whoa.

03:38.018 --> 03:39.453
Bad timing
on my part.

03:39.487 --> 03:41.455
Don't worry.
Everything's fine in Keeksland.

03:41.489 --> 03:43.457
Just, uh... I got to go.

03:43.491 --> 03:45.726
Got a top secret mission.

03:45.759 --> 03:47.328
Kensi will
brief you.

03:47.361 --> 03:48.762
Hey, I heart you both.

03:48.796 --> 03:50.431
Aw.

03:54.034 --> 03:56.637
It's an LAPD thing.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.005
Mm-hmm. Well,

03:58.038 --> 03:59.507
Nell's got a case thing.

03:59.540 --> 04:01.642
So, chop, chop.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.677
Yeah. Chop, chop.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.015
Okay. Thanks.
Hey, Kensi.

04:08.048 --> 04:10.918
Hey, Hidoko. Uh,
where are the boys?

04:10.951 --> 04:12.986
Uh, Callen and Sam are
already at the crime scene.

04:13.020 --> 04:14.555
Where's your boy?

04:14.588 --> 04:16.890
Oh, LAPD sensitivity training.

04:16.924 --> 04:18.492
Supposed to take all day.

04:18.526 --> 04:21.395
All righty then.

04:21.429 --> 04:25.499
So, last night, there was
a fatal explosion at the Riven,

04:25.533 --> 04:26.834
a popular Hollywood
dive bar.

04:26.867 --> 04:28.502
Uh, three people
have died.

04:28.536 --> 04:31.939
LAFD have determined
it was an incendiary device,

04:31.972 --> 04:34.642
though no video
was recovered from the bar.

04:34.675 --> 04:36.377
A firebombing in the
middle of Hollywood?

04:36.410 --> 04:37.445
That's not good.

04:37.478 --> 04:38.879
What about the victims?

04:38.912 --> 04:42.082
Well, we've identified
Ernesto Herrera and Pei Liu.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.084
We're still tracking
their addresses.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.387
What does this have
to do with NCIS?

04:46.420 --> 04:49.457
Well, Herrera and Liu both left
the Marines two years ago.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.491
Different units.

04:50.524 --> 04:51.992
Looks like they both have
gang-related charges

04:52.025 --> 04:55.095
on their records--
MS-13 and Wah Ching.

04:55.128 --> 04:56.029
Serious stuff.

04:56.063 --> 04:58.532
Different military units,
different gangs.

04:58.566 --> 04:59.600
What about the third victim?

04:59.633 --> 05:02.536
Uh, unfortunately, he was
the most badly burned,

05:02.570 --> 05:04.071
so no I.D. yet.

05:04.104 --> 05:05.205
Any connection
between the victims?

05:05.238 --> 05:08.509
Uh, no, but gangs often recruit
former military members

05:08.542 --> 05:11.111
for their weapons
and combat skills.

05:11.144 --> 05:13.113
So last night's attack
could be the beginning

05:13.146 --> 05:15.916
of a larger military-related
gang conflict.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.751
Well, if other gangs
are recruiting ex-Marines

05:17.785 --> 05:20.554
for their ranks, we have to know
about it and we have to stop it.

05:20.588 --> 05:22.423
(footsteps approaching)

05:22.456 --> 05:24.558
Well, I love your enthusiasm.

05:24.592 --> 05:26.760
Except the fire
department called

05:26.794 --> 05:29.497
and said that someone
survived the blast.

05:29.530 --> 05:32.433
And since Deeks is away
on important business,

05:32.466 --> 05:34.968
I'm suggesting
that you and Hidoko

05:35.002 --> 05:37.037
could go to the hospital
and see what she has to say.

05:37.070 --> 05:38.772
Sure thing. Yeah.

05:38.806 --> 05:40.508
Okay. I will send you
the address

05:40.541 --> 05:41.575
to the witness' hospital.

05:41.609 --> 05:43.511
And I will check
social media

05:43.544 --> 05:45.979
for posts from the bar
last night. #teamwork.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.715
Oh.
One for Kensi.

05:47.748 --> 05:49.450
And... Okay.

05:49.483 --> 05:50.851
Ouch.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.754
(clears throat)

05:53.787 --> 05:55.155
Double ouch.

05:55.188 --> 05:58.626
CALLEN: Nell said the 911 call
came in around 2:00 a.m.

05:58.659 --> 06:00.127
That's closing time.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.596
Someone was waiting around
for these guys.

06:02.630 --> 06:05.899
Yeah, then went to a lot of
trouble to torch the place.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.569
(sighs)

06:08.602 --> 06:10.604
(indistinct chatter)

06:15.776 --> 06:19.413
Looks like the fuse
from a thermite grenade.

06:19.447 --> 06:22.516
Burns at 4,000 degrees
almost through anything.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.488
I'm guessing
that includes a hard drive

06:27.521 --> 06:29.523
with security footage.

06:30.791 --> 06:32.626
Whoever did this,

06:32.660 --> 06:34.462
they knew the place.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.764
They wanted to destroy
the evidence.

06:36.797 --> 06:39.399
Well, he was
an overachiever.

06:42.002 --> 06:43.704
(knocking)

06:43.737 --> 06:45.806
Eleanor?

06:45.839 --> 06:49.176
Oh, Lord. You are not my mama,
and I am not dead.

06:49.209 --> 06:50.711
Call me Ellie.
All right.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.646
I'm Special Agent Kensi Blye
from NCIS.

06:52.680 --> 06:54.147
This is my colleague,
Harley Hidoko.

06:54.181 --> 06:55.649
I hope we aren't
interrupting.

06:55.683 --> 06:56.850
You're kidding me, right?

06:56.884 --> 06:59.052
I just watched six straight
episodes of Tiny House.

06:59.086 --> 07:02.189
How can anybody live
all cramped up like that?

07:02.222 --> 07:03.757
That's just insane.

07:03.791 --> 07:05.859
Listen, can you ladies
get me out of here?

07:05.893 --> 07:07.961
We can surely talk
to your doctors.

07:07.995 --> 07:09.963
Good. 'Cause I already been here
a few hours,

07:09.997 --> 07:11.832
and I am done with all this.

07:11.865 --> 07:13.767
Can you tell us what
happened last night?

07:13.801 --> 07:15.035
Sure.

07:15.068 --> 07:16.970
I let Teddie go early.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.206
That's my bouncer.
Place was dead.

07:19.239 --> 07:20.941
I called last call.

07:20.974 --> 07:23.711
Two guys were still there,
another one smoking outside.

07:23.744 --> 07:28.248
Then this drunk lady asked me
to show her the restroom.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.851
I walked her back,
and then boom.

07:30.884 --> 07:31.852
Boom?

07:31.885 --> 07:32.853
Bada-boom!

07:32.886 --> 07:33.954
Lights out, good night.

07:33.987 --> 07:35.956
I wake up in the refrigerator

07:35.989 --> 07:38.692
with two Mr. August firemen
standing over me,

07:38.726 --> 07:41.729
all sweaty
and sooty.

07:42.963 --> 07:45.232
(sighs)
Place is all burned up.

07:45.265 --> 07:47.034
Three dead guys on the ground.

07:47.067 --> 07:48.802
Had you ever seen that woman
before?

07:48.836 --> 07:51.805
Nope. But you want to know
the craziest part?

07:51.839 --> 07:54.174
She throws me
in the refrigerator, right?

07:54.207 --> 07:57.778
But also turns it off,
calls 911 from my phone.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.813
Why would anybody do that?

08:02.015 --> 08:03.116
Why would anybody do that?

08:03.150 --> 08:04.284
Give us a second, please.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.986
Go get 'em, girls.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.121
All right.

08:09.156 --> 08:12.092
Okay, let's just
recap for a second.

08:12.125 --> 08:14.261
So, our mystery woman locks
Ellie in a refrigerator,

08:14.294 --> 08:16.930
the only safe place to
be while the building
around her's on fire.

08:16.964 --> 08:18.298
She didn't want to hurt
any civilians.

08:18.331 --> 08:20.033
She was calculated.

08:20.067 --> 08:22.670
But we have three dead
bodies, no known connection,

08:22.703 --> 08:24.805
murdered by a woman
that no one else saw.

08:26.039 --> 08:27.941
Okay.

08:29.042 --> 08:32.012
Slashes here and here.
Drops him instantly.

08:32.045 --> 08:34.882
Fatal blow between
the eyes kills him.

08:34.915 --> 08:36.750
Falls forward.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.118
This guy comes up, weapon drawn.

08:38.151 --> 08:39.753
Yeah, but before he
can get a shot off,

08:39.787 --> 08:41.755
the killer disarms him,
drops him.

08:41.789 --> 08:43.624
Not before he snaps his arm,

08:43.657 --> 08:45.959
twists the neck.

08:45.993 --> 08:48.629
Then he takes his gun,

08:48.662 --> 08:50.831
unloads it in this guy
as he comes through the door.

08:53.300 --> 08:56.169
This guy dropped
combat-trained gang members

08:56.203 --> 08:57.671
like it was nothing.

08:57.705 --> 08:59.039
Three kills,

08:59.072 --> 09:00.040
three different methods.

09:00.073 --> 09:01.308
Clean exit.

09:01.341 --> 09:02.843
No witnesses.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.244
Only a handful of
guys in the world

09:04.277 --> 09:05.979
could pull something
like this off.

09:06.013 --> 09:08.682
Handful of guys
and at least one woman.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.635
KENSI:
Eric!
Oh, my...

09:27.668 --> 09:29.236
What are you doing?

09:29.269 --> 09:30.771
I'm...

09:30.804 --> 09:32.305
I'm stress-eating sugar.

09:32.339 --> 09:34.307
This woman's a ghost.
I-I ran Kaleidoscope

09:34.341 --> 09:37.110
on some traffic cam images
around the bar in Hollywood.

09:37.144 --> 09:40.213
Absolutely no women
were found in the area

09:40.247 --> 09:41.815
at the time of the explosion.
I don't know what to do.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.984
Eric, don't be so hard
on yourself, okay?
Yeah.

09:44.017 --> 09:45.819
This woman killed three men,
two of which

09:45.853 --> 09:47.688
were former military,
so it seems pretty normal to me

09:47.721 --> 09:48.956
that she could evade
some cameras.

09:48.989 --> 09:49.957
You think?
Yeah.

09:49.990 --> 09:50.958
That makes me feel better.

09:50.991 --> 09:52.960
Hey. Oh, check this out.
Come with me.
No.

09:52.993 --> 09:54.361
Ew. That...
Come here.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.730
Um, you know the
fuse that Sam found?

09:56.764 --> 09:57.731
Yes.

09:57.765 --> 09:59.800
It's an AN-M14.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.101
A thermite grenade.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.203
HIDOKO:
Those are hard to come by.

10:03.236 --> 10:04.672
Only way a civilian
could get their hands on one

10:04.705 --> 10:05.939
would be through
the black market.
Hmm.

10:05.973 --> 10:07.808
Okay, so our suspect has
ties to the military

10:07.841 --> 10:10.210
or a black market contact.
And, interestingly enough,

10:10.243 --> 10:12.045
a case of these
went missing,

10:12.079 --> 10:13.180
along with a slew
of other weapons,

10:13.213 --> 10:14.648
about a year ago
at the Marine base

10:14.682 --> 10:15.749
at Twentynine Palms.

10:15.783 --> 10:18.018
Okay, a job like that's
almost impossible to pull off.

10:18.051 --> 10:20.420
Yeah, well, someone achieved
the almost impossible

10:20.453 --> 10:22.055
and got away with it, too.

10:22.089 --> 10:24.324
ATF always suspected
this guy...

10:24.357 --> 10:25.693
Actually, can you just...

10:25.726 --> 10:26.827
Yeah.

10:26.860 --> 10:28.128
This guy.

10:28.161 --> 10:29.196
Jackson Horton.

10:29.229 --> 10:31.031
But, uh, no one
could pin it on him.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.133
Well, tell Callen
we're gonna go talk to Jackson.

10:33.166 --> 10:34.868
Thank you, Eric.
Yeah.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.209
(indistinct chatter)

10:42.242 --> 10:45.345
This woman got her hands
on a thermite grenade,

10:45.378 --> 10:48.749
drops two military men,
and knifes a third.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.684
She could be a gang member.

10:50.718 --> 10:52.252
Or former military.

10:52.285 --> 10:54.054
Dangerous either way.

10:54.087 --> 10:56.757
I met a girl in a bar like this
in Georgia.

10:56.790 --> 10:59.693
You met a lot of girls
in bars like this.

10:59.727 --> 11:01.729
Yeah, but this one was special.

11:01.762 --> 11:03.263
The girl or the bar?

11:03.296 --> 11:04.397
(phone rings)
Ah.

11:05.432 --> 11:07.400
What's up, Nell?

11:07.434 --> 11:09.737
NELL: Great, so,
I've got an address for Pei Liu,

11:09.770 --> 11:11.872
the second victim.
I'm sending it to you now.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.440
All right, thanks.

11:13.473 --> 11:16.009
Can you and Eric cross-reference
former female military

11:16.043 --> 11:18.078
with current known
female gang members?

11:18.111 --> 11:20.080
I'm already searching.

11:20.113 --> 11:23.283
We're gonna go
from zero suspects to a hundred.

11:23.316 --> 11:26.419
Yeah, well,
the more the merrier.

11:26.453 --> 11:28.455
(breathing deeply)

11:33.927 --> 11:35.929
(clears throat)

11:38.065 --> 11:40.267
(clears throat loudly)

11:41.935 --> 11:44.872
(clears throat, coughing)

11:44.905 --> 11:46.239
Marty, you okay?

11:46.273 --> 11:47.107
Deeks.

11:47.140 --> 11:48.241
There's a water fountain
just over there.

11:48.275 --> 11:51.078
No, I'm good. I'm fine.
What are... what are you doing?

11:51.111 --> 11:52.913
Are you...
are you medi-meditating?

11:52.946 --> 11:54.748
Yep. I do this every
day around this time.

11:54.782 --> 11:56.383
Figured I'd stick to my routine

11:56.416 --> 11:58.085
after the kind of morning I had.

11:58.118 --> 12:00.921
Explains why you're so calm.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.990
Why don't you tell me
what happened there.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.025
Ooh, okay.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.327
I just finished
a 6:00 a.m. training session

12:07.360 --> 12:08.361
with a client in Beverly Hills.

12:08.395 --> 12:10.263
So, I'm walking to...
Wait a minute. 6:00 a.m.?

12:10.297 --> 12:12.065
That seems a little early.
Was it a... was it a celebrity?

12:12.099 --> 12:13.967
Ooh, was it a Real Housewife?
You can tell me. I'm a cop.

12:14.001 --> 12:15.302
That's confidential.
Okay.

12:15.335 --> 12:16.904
You understand secrets,
don't you, Marty?

12:16.937 --> 12:19.472
Deeks.
Sure.

12:19.506 --> 12:21.208
So, no, it wasn't a celebrity.

12:21.241 --> 12:22.475
Well, that's far
less interesting,

12:22.509 --> 12:23.676
but you can continue
with your story.

12:23.710 --> 12:26.814
You were walking.
So, I'm walking
to the juice bar...

12:26.847 --> 12:28.916
Got that.
and this car screeches up.

12:28.949 --> 12:31.351
And this squirrely guy,
this dude jumps out,

12:31.384 --> 12:32.953
shoves a gun in my face

12:32.986 --> 12:34.822
and demands my bag,

12:34.855 --> 12:36.890
which has my wallet
and my laptop in it.

12:36.924 --> 12:38.959
So you gave the...

12:38.992 --> 12:41.194
squirrely guy your bag?

12:41.228 --> 12:42.896
I'm not gonna argue with a gun.

12:42.930 --> 12:45.232
Look who I'm telling.
Am I right, Martin?

12:45.265 --> 12:47.567
Deeks. It's Deeks.
Sure.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.236
All right, well,
listen, this is easy.

12:49.269 --> 12:51.071
I'll just, uh, cruise down
to the precinct.

12:51.104 --> 12:52.940
You know,
fill out some paperwork,

12:52.973 --> 12:54.474
see if I can help you
get your bag back.

12:54.507 --> 12:56.476
'Cause I get it. It's tough.
You know, you lose your laptop,

12:56.509 --> 12:58.979
you lose your music,
documents...
I won't.

12:59.012 --> 13:00.848
I backed up everything.

13:00.881 --> 13:03.383
Smart. You're a
super smart guy.
But I would hate

13:03.416 --> 13:05.886
for someone to get their hands
on those documents.

13:05.919 --> 13:09.289
It has some, uh...
workouts that I filmed.

13:11.324 --> 13:15.195
Sorry, what?
Y-You... you f-filmed

13:15.228 --> 13:17.397
your workouts?
Filmed my workouts.

13:19.599 --> 13:22.502
You mean, like...
like a training exercise

13:22.535 --> 13:24.938
that would be, like,
you giving...
No.

13:24.972 --> 13:26.273
By yourself?
The client.

13:26.306 --> 13:28.175
You and a client?
Very special client.

13:28.208 --> 13:30.043
(whispering):
My mom wasn't lying.

13:30.077 --> 13:32.279
Yeah, no, uh...

13:32.312 --> 13:34.882
What kind of, um...

13:34.915 --> 13:37.617
what kind of... kind of workouts
are we talking about?

13:37.650 --> 13:39.920
You know, push-ups.
Uh-huh.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.254
Knee bends.
Yeah.

13:41.288 --> 13:42.890
Squats.
Okay.

13:42.923 --> 13:45.425
Okay. All right, you
can stop talking.
Burpees.

13:45.458 --> 13:46.860
All right, so,
we definitely...

13:46.894 --> 13:48.561
We'll want to
make sure those...

13:48.595 --> 13:50.397
don't end up online.

13:50.430 --> 13:52.199
Why, no, Martin.

13:52.232 --> 13:54.467
We don't.

13:54.501 --> 13:56.503
No.

13:58.505 --> 13:59.940
(humming)

14:05.312 --> 14:07.915
So, what Georgia dive bars
are we talking?

14:07.948 --> 14:10.050
Been to a few in Fort Benning

14:10.083 --> 14:11.451
when I was in Airborne
School in the SEALs.

14:11.484 --> 14:13.053
Mm, the wrong Georgia.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.888
No parachuting. No peaches.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.223
Lot of Chechens, though.

14:16.256 --> 14:18.058
Yeah, and caves.

14:18.091 --> 14:19.326
And wine.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.961
Yeah, you've been there, huh?

14:20.994 --> 14:22.162
(indistinct chatter)

14:22.195 --> 14:24.131
Sam?

14:24.164 --> 14:27.367
That's a lot of company
for a dead man.

14:47.554 --> 14:49.923
(gunfire)

14:49.957 --> 14:51.191
All set out here.

14:55.328 --> 14:56.563
Sam, you in position?

14:56.596 --> 14:57.497
In position.

14:59.266 --> 15:02.269
Three, two, one, breach!

15:07.507 --> 15:09.442
In. Come on.
Breach.

15:10.377 --> 15:11.578
Federal agents.

15:11.611 --> 15:12.612
Get him, get him, get him.

15:12.645 --> 15:14.014
Stay down.
Federal agents.

15:14.047 --> 15:15.315
AGENT:
Show me your hands now!

15:15.348 --> 15:17.484
AGENT 2:
Federal agents. Stay down!

15:17.517 --> 15:19.352
Right there, let
me see your hands.

15:19.386 --> 15:20.587
(indistinct shouting)

15:20.620 --> 15:23.123
Got it. Move.
Clear here.

15:23.156 --> 15:24.691
West bedroom clear!

15:24.724 --> 15:27.127
Not very discreet.
No, it's not.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.196
Lot of weight right here.

15:29.229 --> 15:30.530
AGENT:
All right, move out.

15:30.563 --> 15:33.033
Careful.

15:33.066 --> 15:34.501
You don't want to cut yourself.

15:34.534 --> 15:36.536
(indistinct shouting)

15:38.638 --> 15:41.108
Only two numbers in here.

15:41.141 --> 15:44.277
One for Slim, one for Peewee.

15:44.311 --> 15:46.213
Easy, man.
Keep moving.

15:46.246 --> 15:47.414
Easy!

15:47.447 --> 15:48.415
(agent speaks
indistinctly)

15:48.448 --> 15:50.083
It's a rough bunch.

15:50.117 --> 15:52.119
Something had 'em spooked.

15:52.152 --> 15:54.121
Well, after that attack
on the bar,

15:54.154 --> 15:57.124
word must have spread
through the L.A. underground.

15:57.157 --> 15:59.592
These guys are on the defense.

15:59.626 --> 16:03.263
I don't like it, G.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.098
I don't like it.

16:05.132 --> 16:07.634
KENSI:
Eric says Horton lives
on the property,

16:07.667 --> 16:10.270
so keep your eyes peeled
in case he tries to run.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.606
HIDOKO:
You think of everything
ahead of time.

16:13.640 --> 16:15.542
(Kensi chuckles)

16:15.575 --> 16:18.678
And you make this look
so easy.

16:18.711 --> 16:20.147
You know, when I took this job
assisting Mosley,

16:20.180 --> 16:21.414
I had no idea
what I was getting into.

16:21.448 --> 16:23.350
Totally different
from what I was doing

16:23.383 --> 16:25.152
with the female engagement team.
Oh, I'm sure.

16:25.185 --> 16:26.553
One minute, you're talking
to village women,

16:26.586 --> 16:28.655
the next, you're taking
out a threat on site.

16:28.688 --> 16:31.024
Exactly. And here
it's a lot more rules,

16:31.058 --> 16:32.559
restraint, red tape.

16:32.592 --> 16:34.294
Yeah, I know. It's hard.

16:34.327 --> 16:37.364
Any advice?
Yeah, I do have advice.

16:37.397 --> 16:40.100
Learn to have your team's back.

16:40.133 --> 16:42.035
Oh, and Epsom
salts work wonders

16:42.069 --> 16:43.570
when you're too sore to walk.
Hmm.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.373
Jackson Horton?

16:46.406 --> 16:48.041
(muffled scream)

16:48.075 --> 16:49.242
Camper.

16:49.276 --> 16:51.111
(muffled scream)

16:52.145 --> 16:54.247
(muffled scream)

16:55.482 --> 16:56.783
Federal agent.

16:56.816 --> 16:57.784
You okay?

16:57.817 --> 17:00.087
Mm-hmm.

17:02.089 --> 17:03.723
Jackson Horton?

17:03.756 --> 17:05.192
Call me Jackhammer.

17:05.225 --> 17:08.095
Yeah, we're not gonna do that.

17:08.128 --> 17:09.462
Well, in that case,

17:09.496 --> 17:12.365
what can I do you for,
Miss Federal Agent Ladies?

17:12.399 --> 17:14.434
Okay, Mr. Reseda
Storage Specialist.

17:14.467 --> 17:15.535
We want to know
about the weapons

17:15.568 --> 17:18.205
you allegedly stole
at Twentynine Palms last year.

17:18.238 --> 17:19.506
Well, I want to know about why

17:19.539 --> 17:20.807
my cousin Jerry's
buying new subwoofers

17:20.840 --> 17:22.675
when he still owes me
300 bucks.

17:22.709 --> 17:25.345
Jackson, seriously.
What happened?

17:25.378 --> 17:27.314
I got tied up at work.

17:27.347 --> 17:28.548
(laughs)

17:28.581 --> 17:30.150
Look, I work alone.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.551
I got taken off guard.
I got tied up.

17:31.584 --> 17:33.720
Someone didn't pay their bill,
you know.

17:33.753 --> 17:35.288
Did you get a look at him?

17:35.322 --> 17:36.823
"Him"?

17:36.856 --> 17:38.358
Try "her."

17:38.391 --> 17:39.726
Never seen anybody
move that fast,

17:39.759 --> 17:40.827
and I did two tours in Mosul.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.630
Didn't get a look at her face,

17:43.663 --> 17:46.699
but, uh, she had, like,
a Spanish accent.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.536
Okay.

17:49.569 --> 17:51.371
Is that the storage unit

17:51.404 --> 17:53.406
she emptied out?

17:54.607 --> 17:56.576
No.

17:56.609 --> 18:00.213
You know,
now seems like a good time

18:00.247 --> 18:01.548
for you guys to show me
your warrant.

18:01.581 --> 18:04.284
We don't need one
if it's open, Jackhammer.

18:04.317 --> 18:06.853
Ooh.
Here's the good news.

18:06.886 --> 18:08.488
We've rescued you.

18:08.521 --> 18:09.689
Here's the bad news.

18:09.722 --> 18:11.624
Oh, hey.
We're tying you up again.

18:11.658 --> 18:13.326
Hey, come on. Seriously?

18:13.360 --> 18:15.128
Come...

18:15.162 --> 18:16.396
Hey!

18:20.433 --> 18:23.136
Whoa.

18:23.170 --> 18:24.704
All right, I see
a few things missing.

18:24.737 --> 18:26.506
Berettas. Carbine rifles.

18:26.539 --> 18:28.408
Knives. Grenades.
Yeah.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.143
Not good.
No, not good at all.

18:30.177 --> 18:31.778
You want to know why?

18:31.811 --> 18:34.814
Women only steal
what they intend to use.

18:38.851 --> 18:40.019
(sighs)

18:40.052 --> 18:43.190
This is what we have from
The Riven's social media feed.

18:44.691 --> 18:45.925
SAM: She made sure
her face is hidden

18:45.958 --> 18:47.760
in every single shot,
every angle.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.429
CALLEN:
That's solid tradecraft.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.698
She has a pretty good
drunk girl routine, too.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.766
She loaded up
on Ka-Bars, Berettas,

18:53.800 --> 18:56.403
grenades, AT4s.
AT4s?

18:56.436 --> 18:57.204
She stole missile launchers?

18:57.237 --> 18:58.838
She's taking it
to the next level.

18:58.871 --> 18:59.872
KENSI:
You're right.

18:59.906 --> 19:00.973
NELL:
Hey, guys.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.276
So, dental records just
came in. We've identified

19:03.310 --> 19:04.844
the third and final victim.

19:04.877 --> 19:05.845
And who's the outlier?

19:05.878 --> 19:07.780
That would be Luciano Carvalho.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.317
Carvalho worked
at the Brazilian Consulate

19:10.350 --> 19:13.753
under Consul General Enzo Souza.

19:13.786 --> 19:15.455
I've contacted his office
for the past 30 minutes.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.190
Unfortunately,
no one is picking up.

19:17.224 --> 19:19.592
Jackson said
she had a Spanish accent.

19:19.626 --> 19:21.394
Right. It could have also
been Portuguese, though.

19:21.428 --> 19:22.529
That's what they speak
in Brazil,

19:22.562 --> 19:23.796
and it does sound
a lot like Spanish.

19:23.830 --> 19:25.298
This assassin just
took out a diplomat

19:25.332 --> 19:26.599
from a major foreign ally.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.368
We need to figure
out our next move

19:28.401 --> 19:29.636
before this goes international.

19:29.669 --> 19:31.738
I think I can help with that.

19:31.771 --> 19:33.740
I met Souza
years ago in Brazil

19:33.773 --> 19:35.742
while I was working
with Congresswoman Geary

19:35.775 --> 19:37.610
on her protection detail.

19:37.644 --> 19:39.746
You think Souza would be
involved with this mess?

19:39.779 --> 19:41.348
All I know is Souza's no angel.

19:41.381 --> 19:42.715
I say we pay him a visit

19:42.749 --> 19:44.984
and assess the situation
ourselves.

19:45.017 --> 19:47.920
Time to put on
your big boy suits.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.006
Shay Mosley.

20:07.039 --> 20:08.708
Good afternoon.

20:08.741 --> 20:10.643
The consul general
would like to see

20:10.677 --> 20:11.878
Senhora Mosley alone.

20:11.911 --> 20:15.382
He requests that her sidekicks
not be present.

20:15.415 --> 20:18.885
You don't mind, do you, boys?

20:18.918 --> 20:21.554
No, ma'am.

20:24.557 --> 20:26.959
"Sidekicks"?

20:28.728 --> 20:32.031
Ah, the lovely Senhora Mosley.

20:32.064 --> 20:32.899
Aw.

20:32.932 --> 20:35.034
Please, be comfortable here.
(chuckles)

20:35.067 --> 20:37.937
Shay, you look
as beautiful as ever.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.539
Oh, and you've remained

20:39.572 --> 20:40.673
as charming as ever.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.542
(chuckles) A coffee? Tea?

20:42.575 --> 20:44.811
Caipirinha?
I can call for cachaça

20:44.844 --> 20:45.912
and lime, so...

20:45.945 --> 20:46.979
We already have

20:47.013 --> 20:49.316
plenty of sugar. (chuckles)

20:49.349 --> 20:51.451
Ah. Coffee, please.

20:51.484 --> 20:52.819
I may overstay my welcome

20:52.852 --> 20:54.687
if there are caipirinhas
involved.

20:54.721 --> 20:56.989
(laughs):
Oh, impossible, Senhora.

20:57.023 --> 20:58.958
Impossible.

20:58.991 --> 21:01.260
Please.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.764
(doorbell buzzes)

21:07.767 --> 21:09.569
(door opens)

21:09.602 --> 21:11.438
Check out these two guys.

21:11.471 --> 21:14.006
Good to see you again.

21:14.040 --> 21:16.343
Maybe they lost their passports.

21:16.376 --> 21:18.378
(indistinct chatter)

21:26.553 --> 21:28.955
Is there a washroom around here?

21:31.758 --> 21:33.393
Thank you.

21:42.769 --> 21:44.771
(phone ringing)

21:56.783 --> 21:59.552
Looks like we found
Slim and Peewee.

21:59.586 --> 22:02.355
Well played.

22:02.389 --> 22:03.556
(chuckles)

22:03.590 --> 22:05.024
Are you enjoying
your post in the States?

22:05.057 --> 22:06.793
Immensely.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.095
Almost feels like home
in Sao Paulo.
Mmm.

22:09.128 --> 22:12.832
Proximity to the beach,
concrete, traffic.

22:12.865 --> 22:16.636
I believe it was during the
official tour of the Amazon

22:16.669 --> 22:19.739
that you saw two capuchin
monkeys in an argument,

22:19.772 --> 22:22.709
and you-- how do you say--
you...

22:22.742 --> 22:24.944
you, um... chuckled.

22:24.977 --> 22:27.113
(laughs)
Yeah.

22:27.146 --> 22:29.616
Your-your laugh

22:29.649 --> 22:32.385
delighted everyone
in the delegation.

22:32.419 --> 22:34.987
Yes, it's been, uh,

22:35.021 --> 22:38.558
quite some time
since I thought about that trip.
Hmm.

22:38.591 --> 22:41.628
Listen, I, um, don't mean
to jump so quickly

22:41.661 --> 22:43.530
into business,
but I'm here to...
You're a...

22:43.563 --> 22:45.398
Hey, you're an American.

22:45.432 --> 22:47.500
You get to the point.
I understand.

22:47.534 --> 22:49.769
I'm here to discuss...

22:49.802 --> 22:51.738
Luciano Carvalho.

22:51.771 --> 22:54.974
He was a... close friend

22:55.007 --> 22:57.009
and colleague
for a very long time.

22:57.043 --> 22:59.011
I'm sorry for your loss.

22:59.045 --> 23:01.448
Hmm.
Do you have any idea

23:01.481 --> 23:03.450
who may have wanted him dead?

23:04.617 --> 23:07.554
My associates found
that Carvalho

23:07.587 --> 23:09.622
had been spending time

23:09.656 --> 23:11.491
with unsavory individuals.

23:11.524 --> 23:13.159
And what was he was doing
at the bar?

23:13.192 --> 23:15.127
(soft chuckle)

23:15.161 --> 23:17.764
Miss Shay...

23:17.797 --> 23:19.766
I always took you

23:19.799 --> 23:22.469
to be more astute.

23:25.872 --> 23:27.740
He was at the bar...

23:27.774 --> 23:30.009
plotting my assassination.

23:42.722 --> 23:45.692
Okay. Yeah.

23:45.725 --> 23:47.093
Amazing.

23:47.126 --> 23:48.761
Here you go-- mango.

23:48.795 --> 23:49.729
Thanks.

23:49.762 --> 23:51.898
No, I'm glad to see our
tax dollars at work.

23:51.931 --> 23:54.634
(laughs) All right,
you, too. Thanks.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.102
Good news?

23:56.135 --> 23:58.237
Yeah, great news.
We got your bag and your laptop,

23:58.270 --> 24:00.973
some sort of notebook.
Oh, my sketchpad.

24:01.007 --> 24:02.074
Studied drawing in college.
Oh, nice.

24:02.108 --> 24:02.975
Still dabble.

24:03.009 --> 24:04.210
So, what do you do,
like, still life,

24:04.243 --> 24:05.144
cartoons?
Nah.

24:05.177 --> 24:07.013
I prefer to dabble in nudes.

24:07.046 --> 24:09.982
Seriously?
Yeah.

24:10.016 --> 24:12.619
It just does not end with you.

24:12.652 --> 24:14.253
Nah.

24:14.286 --> 24:16.856
Um, all right, so I'll
head down to the precinct.

24:16.889 --> 24:18.791
My buddy says it usually
takes two weeks to process.

24:18.825 --> 24:20.560
I'm just gonna go
and I'm gonna pick it up

24:20.593 --> 24:21.728
and I'm gonna, I'm gonna get it.

24:21.761 --> 24:24.030
Yup. Yup.
I owe you one.
I know

24:24.063 --> 24:25.998
stolen property's
not your usual territory.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.867
Well, it's not

24:27.900 --> 24:30.102
my usual territory,
but it's far less dangerous.

24:30.136 --> 24:32.238
That's what I heard.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.574
Bert really worries
about you guys.

24:34.607 --> 24:36.543
Yeah, well,
I worry about her, too.

24:36.576 --> 24:38.144
Don't worry.

24:38.177 --> 24:40.079
I really love that girl.

24:40.112 --> 24:42.114
You know what
it's like, Martin.

24:44.150 --> 24:45.752
Yeah.

24:45.785 --> 24:47.787
Yeah, I do, Guy.

24:48.888 --> 24:51.223
Thanks.
Yeah. Cheers.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.025
Enjoy your mango juice.

24:53.059 --> 24:54.961
It's $14.

24:54.994 --> 24:57.764
Yeah. $14.

24:57.797 --> 25:00.099
This way, there?
(sighs)

25:00.132 --> 25:01.868
Hey. Where's Sam
and Mosley?

25:01.901 --> 25:03.235
Mosley's with
Consul General Souza

25:03.269 --> 25:04.837
trying to convince him
that the consulate

25:04.871 --> 25:06.639
is no longer safe.
Sam's backing her up.

25:06.673 --> 25:07.840
Do you feel like
she's getting anywhere?

25:07.874 --> 25:11.778
Souza claims that he knows
nothing about Carvalho's death.

25:11.811 --> 25:15.047
He believes that Carvalho was
in the bar plotting to kill him.

25:15.081 --> 25:16.783
Well, Mosley said herself
that he's no angel.

25:16.816 --> 25:19.185
Maybe the people that worked
for him wanted to take him out.

25:19.218 --> 25:20.620
In that case,

25:20.653 --> 25:23.055
tell me what you make of this.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.757
Carlos Rey.

25:24.791 --> 25:26.058
A teacher-turned-activist

25:26.092 --> 25:29.061
tired of drugs destroying
the Sao Paulo favelas.

25:29.095 --> 25:30.930
He was blamed in the newspapers

25:30.963 --> 25:34.701
for bombing a drug den
by then-Congressman Enzo Souza.

25:34.734 --> 25:36.102
Any guesses on

25:36.135 --> 25:38.204
who tipped off the reporters?

25:38.237 --> 25:41.007
100 Brazilian reals
for the, uh, winner.

25:42.709 --> 25:44.944
I'll just tell you myself.
(clears throat)

25:44.977 --> 25:47.914
Souza's chief of staff,
Luciano Carvalho.

25:47.947 --> 25:49.148
KENSI:
Okay.

25:49.181 --> 25:51.283
So Carvalho and Souza have known
each other for a long time.

25:51.317 --> 25:52.484
Could have had a falling out.

25:52.518 --> 25:56.255
What if Carvalho hired our
mystery woman to take out Souza?

25:56.288 --> 25:57.724
He meets her at the bar...

25:57.757 --> 25:59.191
She kills him and his buddies.

25:59.225 --> 26:01.027
I don't see it.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.228
Why would she do that?

26:02.261 --> 26:04.797
(tablet beeps)
Mosley

26:04.831 --> 26:05.965
just convinced Souza

26:05.998 --> 26:07.867
to take an 18-hour
flight to Singapore.

26:07.900 --> 26:09.101
Well, that's smart.

26:09.135 --> 26:10.369
Buys us the time
that we need.

26:10.402 --> 26:12.939
She was probably watching him
for weeks, maybe even months,

26:12.972 --> 26:14.641
waiting for the perfect
time to strike.

26:14.674 --> 26:15.942
Well, this is gonna
force her to adapt

26:15.975 --> 26:17.043
to something she hadn't planned.

26:17.076 --> 26:19.912
Great. So we are playing
intercontinental hot potato

26:19.946 --> 26:21.781
with a senior diplomat as bait.

26:21.814 --> 26:24.651
Mmm. You think we're
on D.C.'s blacklist now?
(phone dings)

26:24.684 --> 26:26.252
If Souza gets killed
in our backyard,

26:26.285 --> 26:29.155
a hundred Mosleys couldn't
keep the lights on here.
Mmm.

26:29.188 --> 26:31.157
Sam's taking point
on Souza's security detail.

26:31.190 --> 26:32.892
They'll be at the airport
in an hour.

26:32.925 --> 26:34.160
You need to be our eyes.

26:34.193 --> 26:36.195
By all means.

26:37.229 --> 26:39.799
(engine starts)

26:44.771 --> 26:46.773
The package is on board.
Kensi, you two set?

26:46.806 --> 26:48.775
Ready to roll.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.977
Eric, how are your eyes?

26:51.010 --> 26:53.012
20/20 thus far.

27:00.720 --> 27:02.989
SAM: Kensi, keep your head
on a swivel.

27:03.022 --> 27:04.991
KENSI:
You got it.

27:05.024 --> 27:06.993
SAM:
Nell, you got our backs.

27:07.026 --> 27:09.361
You are free and clear, Sam.

27:09.395 --> 27:10.797
No one's following.

27:16.202 --> 27:18.137
We're about five miles out
from the airport.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.840
Yeah, good,
'cause we're hungry back here.

27:22.742 --> 27:25.144
(tires screech)

27:25.177 --> 27:27.747
Watch out!

27:33.452 --> 27:34.653
Sam!

27:35.354 --> 27:37.356
She's got a second missile.

27:43.896 --> 27:45.131
Sam?

27:48.300 --> 27:50.102
(grunts)
Sam!

27:50.136 --> 27:51.337
Sam!

27:51.370 --> 27:52.872
Wake up.
You okay?
I'm good.

27:52.905 --> 27:56.208
I'm good, too.
In case you're wondering.

27:56.242 --> 27:59.078
Frame's bent.
Frame's bent.

27:59.111 --> 28:00.279
CALLEN:
Go after her. Go!

28:00.312 --> 28:01.680
Let's go,
let's go!

28:03.816 --> 28:05.384
Come on, let's go.

28:08.755 --> 28:09.989
There.

28:11.758 --> 28:12.892
Yeah.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.730
(knocking)

28:19.331 --> 28:20.900
What's a Weedwacker?

28:20.933 --> 28:23.770
I'll tell you on the way.
Get in.

28:25.137 --> 28:26.973
Our asset is safe.

28:27.006 --> 28:28.307
Nice work, Nell.

28:28.340 --> 28:29.375
Nice work.

28:29.408 --> 28:30.709
Thanks.

28:36.983 --> 28:38.951
Take upstairs,
I'll take the front.

28:38.985 --> 28:40.386
Got it.

28:47.126 --> 28:49.095
No sign of her.

28:49.128 --> 28:51.130
No security cams either.

29:14.486 --> 29:16.288
This ends now.

29:16.322 --> 29:18.825
Turn around.

29:18.858 --> 29:20.827
Hands above your head.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.494
Kensi? Kensi.

29:22.528 --> 29:24.130
I got her.

29:25.164 --> 29:28.467
Get on your knees.

29:28.500 --> 29:30.436
(grunts)

29:30.469 --> 29:32.371
(both grunting)

29:53.625 --> 29:55.828
Kensi!

30:17.249 --> 30:19.818
(both grunting)

30:36.335 --> 30:38.404
He hides behind his titles
as his dog Carvalho

30:38.437 --> 30:39.972
kept poisoning my people

30:40.006 --> 30:41.507
with his poeira.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.510
(coughs, grunts)

31:13.505 --> 31:13.940
(grunts)
There you go.

31:13.973 --> 31:15.541
All set.
Mmm.

31:15.574 --> 31:17.243
You took some blows.

31:17.276 --> 31:19.345
Mosley's on her way here
with Souza.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.914
I bet she wish she'd put him
on a plane. I know I do.

31:21.948 --> 31:23.182
Hey.

31:23.215 --> 31:25.151
I've never seen
anybody fight like her.

31:25.184 --> 31:26.953
But you gave her hell
right back.

31:26.986 --> 31:29.388
I'm just sorry I didn't
make it to you in time.

31:29.421 --> 31:33.059
You run that fight
nine times out of ten...

31:33.092 --> 31:35.027
you come out on top.

31:35.061 --> 31:37.463
And the tenth time
I come out in a body bag.

31:39.331 --> 31:40.699
She could have killed me,

31:40.732 --> 31:42.634
but she didn't.

31:42.668 --> 31:44.036
No, it was right after
she pointed

31:44.070 --> 31:46.172
a missile launcher
at us.

31:46.205 --> 31:48.074
She's not exactly
a humanitarian.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.509
She said that
Souza and Carvalho

31:50.542 --> 31:52.311
were selling poeira.

31:52.344 --> 31:54.513
That's Brazilian
Portuguese for cocaine.

31:55.547 --> 31:56.682
Oh!

31:56.715 --> 31:58.684
She's got my phone.

31:58.717 --> 32:01.720
Hey, so I'm enhancing
the footage from Sam's dash cam

32:01.753 --> 32:04.123
and running it through
facial rec, but considering

32:04.156 --> 32:05.491
this woman spoke Portuguese,

32:05.524 --> 32:07.526
I'm cross-referencing it
with, uh,

32:07.559 --> 32:09.195
South American federal agencies.

32:09.228 --> 32:11.230
Eric, bring up that photo
behind you.

32:12.298 --> 32:13.699
Uh, zoom in
on Carlos.

32:19.705 --> 32:21.440
That's her.

32:21.473 --> 32:24.010
Holy cow. All right, um,

32:24.043 --> 32:27.513
Interpol file says that she's
Pietra Rey from Sao Paulo.

32:27.546 --> 32:31.317
Uh, her father Carlos
was gunned down in 2002.

32:31.350 --> 32:33.485
Pietra was 13.

32:33.519 --> 32:35.354
She thinks
Carvalho and Souza

32:35.387 --> 32:37.189
murdered her father.

32:37.223 --> 32:39.091
She's here to
avenge his death.

32:39.125 --> 32:41.760
She's also been linked with
Revolucao Sociedade Livre,

32:41.793 --> 32:44.230
which is a Brazilian
militia group.

32:44.263 --> 32:47.466
They train in the jungle
at a young age.

32:47.499 --> 32:49.435
They're deadly fighters.

32:49.468 --> 32:52.338
We need to talk to Souza
about Pietra's next move.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.075
We're here.

32:56.108 --> 32:59.078
Just in time.

33:05.251 --> 33:06.785
Interrogation?

33:06.818 --> 33:08.520
Am I your prisoner?

33:08.554 --> 33:10.456
Perhaps your State Department

33:10.489 --> 33:13.059
will have something
to say about that.

33:13.092 --> 33:15.027
We took a rocket for you.

33:15.061 --> 33:17.296
We need some cooperation.

33:17.329 --> 33:19.165
We got two questions.

33:19.198 --> 33:21.667
Do you know a woman from
Sao Paulo named Pietra Rey?

33:21.700 --> 33:24.136
As I said earlier.

33:24.170 --> 33:26.238
(chuckles)
Americans...

33:26.272 --> 33:28.707
right down to business.

33:28.740 --> 33:30.142
MOSLEY:
There's no time

33:30.176 --> 33:31.377
for anything else.

33:31.410 --> 33:34.680
I do not know of Pietra Rey,

33:34.713 --> 33:37.149
but I know the name Carlos Rey.

33:37.183 --> 33:41.420
He was a terrorist
with reprehensible tactics.

33:41.453 --> 33:44.823
He brought about
his own death

33:44.856 --> 33:46.725
when he endangered
Brazilian citizens.

33:46.758 --> 33:48.260
Second question?

33:48.294 --> 33:52.231
Are you involved
in the Brazilian drug trade?

33:52.264 --> 33:55.301
(scoffs)

33:55.334 --> 33:59.571
Most certainly not.

33:59.605 --> 34:02.408
People in Brazil
like to spread rumors

34:02.441 --> 34:05.111
that fly around like
caracara jungle birds.

34:06.478 --> 34:10.716
The narcotics industry is not
only a fool's endeavor,

34:10.749 --> 34:14.786
it is a blemish on the face of
both of our beautiful countries.

34:14.820 --> 34:17.723
No one trusts a word
he's saying.

34:17.756 --> 34:20.592
ERIC (over computer):
Kensi, your phone
just came back online.

34:20.626 --> 34:22.161
Where is it?

34:22.194 --> 34:23.595
Half a mile from the boatshed.

34:23.629 --> 34:25.531
What?

34:25.564 --> 34:27.466
Oh, no.

34:27.499 --> 34:30.269
No, no, no, no, no.

34:30.302 --> 34:31.437
HIDOKO:
She put a tracker on you?

34:31.470 --> 34:32.638
KENSI:
Yeah.

34:35.141 --> 34:37.209
(sighs)
(phone rings)

34:38.677 --> 34:41.347
Kensi, it's a video call
coming from your phone number.

34:41.380 --> 34:43.515
What?

34:45.517 --> 34:47.286
PIETRA:
Hello, Kensi Blye.

34:47.319 --> 34:48.387
What do you want?

34:48.420 --> 34:49.855
I want you and your friends

34:49.888 --> 34:53.192
to vacate the building without
Souza in the next minute.

34:53.225 --> 34:55.461
Otherwise you'll all die
with him.

34:55.494 --> 34:57.196
Hey, don't hang up.

34:57.229 --> 35:00.132
Go get the boys.

35:03.169 --> 35:06.205
That package you ordered
just arrived.

35:15.714 --> 35:18.784
Pietra tracked Kensi here
and is threatening to fire

35:18.817 --> 35:21.620
a missile into the boatshed
if we leave with Souza.

35:21.653 --> 35:23.189
Kensi's trying
to talk her down.

35:23.222 --> 35:24.690
(Kensi speaking Portuguese)

35:26.725 --> 35:28.694
Kensi, keep her
on the phone.

35:28.727 --> 35:30.529
We're gonna go out
and double back around.

35:30.562 --> 35:32.931
No. I will handle this.

35:32.964 --> 35:34.333
Kensi.
Kens, wait.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.668
Callen, I got this.
(door opens)

35:36.702 --> 35:38.237
Put the consul general
and Mosley upstairs.

35:38.270 --> 35:40.272
Upstairs? Won't that
give her a better shot?

35:40.306 --> 35:42.408
Hetty reinforced the walls
after Duggan got shot.

35:42.441 --> 35:43.575
It's the strongest part
of the building.

35:43.609 --> 35:45.177
Hidoko, you're with me.
Okay.

35:46.512 --> 35:49.348
We're going upstairs.
It isn't safe in here.

35:49.381 --> 35:51.850
Come on. Let's go.

35:56.588 --> 35:58.190
She can't be
that far ahead.

35:58.224 --> 36:00.259
You cover that area.
Got it.

36:00.292 --> 36:01.427
Hurry.

36:02.494 --> 36:04.363
Where are you taking me?

36:04.396 --> 36:05.697
What's going on?

36:06.932 --> 36:10.202
You had her father killed.

36:10.236 --> 36:12.471
Now she's here to kill you.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.373
Is that direct enough for you?

36:18.377 --> 36:20.212
Sam and Mosley are secure.

36:20.246 --> 36:22.481
We're gonna do this one
by the books, Kens.

36:22.514 --> 36:24.316
Kensi, answer me.

36:24.350 --> 36:26.385
She's a couple hundred yards
ahead of you, Callen.

36:31.423 --> 36:33.825
You gonna shoot me in the
back to protect this man?

36:33.859 --> 36:35.227
I know what
you're thinking.

36:35.261 --> 36:37.229
You have no idea
how much I understand.

36:37.263 --> 36:39.398
Are your friends clear
of the building?

36:39.431 --> 36:40.899
Souza's not worth it. Please
don't throw your life away

36:40.932 --> 36:42.368
because of him.

36:43.502 --> 36:44.903
My life ended

36:44.936 --> 36:47.005
when I tried holding
my father's head together

36:47.038 --> 36:50.242
as he died in my arms.

36:50.276 --> 36:52.611
We've got to get
upstairs now.

36:52.644 --> 36:54.680
(gun cocks)

36:55.814 --> 36:57.449
(sighs)

37:00.486 --> 37:02.621
Killing me is not
a good idea.

37:02.654 --> 37:04.723
Oh, I disagree.

37:04.756 --> 37:07.393
SOUZA:
International law stands.

37:07.426 --> 37:11.430
Immunity is not just
an abstract term.

37:11.463 --> 37:12.798
Sam, why aren't you upstairs?

37:12.831 --> 37:14.600
Sam!

37:14.633 --> 37:16.368
SAM:
We got a problem, G.

37:16.402 --> 37:18.470
Kens, Sam and Mosley
aren't upstairs.

37:18.504 --> 37:19.938
You need to take her out now.

37:19.971 --> 37:21.840
Callen, I need more time.
I got this.

37:23.309 --> 37:25.577
You step out of here,
and you're done.

37:25.611 --> 37:27.879
You come closer,
she's done.

37:27.913 --> 37:30.616
MOSLEY:
Put the gun down, Sam.

37:30.649 --> 37:33.585
Put the gun down.

37:36.422 --> 37:38.324
Put the gun down.

37:41.593 --> 37:42.761
You take the shot or I will.

37:42.794 --> 37:44.596
Callen, I need you to trust me.

37:46.365 --> 37:48.367
(Souza grunts)

37:49.435 --> 37:50.569
(groans)

37:50.602 --> 37:51.670
MOSLEY:
Stay down.

37:51.703 --> 37:54.940
No! Wait.
Stop, please.

37:54.973 --> 37:57.309
When I was a teenager,
my dad was murdered.

37:57.343 --> 37:59.678
Okay?

37:59.711 --> 38:02.681
I did, I did really
horrible things.

38:02.714 --> 38:05.083
And I shut away the people
that loved me the most.

38:05.116 --> 38:06.585
But then you know
what I did?

38:06.618 --> 38:08.053
I did something that
I thought was impossible.

38:08.086 --> 38:11.657
I asked for help and I got it.

38:11.690 --> 38:14.860
And that anger no longer
has any control over me.

38:14.893 --> 38:19.030
You could have ended up
a forasteira just like me.

38:19.064 --> 38:23.569
An outsider in my own community.

38:23.602 --> 38:25.704
All I wanted was to fight
in the jungle

38:25.737 --> 38:27.673
for a chance at revenge.

38:27.706 --> 38:29.775
I know. I know. I know you
believe that this is the moment

38:29.808 --> 38:31.843
you've been waiting for your
entire life, but you know what?

38:31.877 --> 38:34.079
You make this decision...

38:34.112 --> 38:36.615
it doesn't change anything.

38:39.050 --> 38:42.754
Listen, making the right
decision, right now,

38:42.788 --> 38:44.890
that will change everything.

38:44.923 --> 38:49.027
So please, please put--
please put it down.

38:49.060 --> 38:51.029
(speaking in Portuguese)

38:51.062 --> 38:53.064
Please put it down.

39:03.509 --> 39:05.511
Please get down
on your knees.

39:14.553 --> 39:15.787
Sam?

39:15.821 --> 39:19.057
We're good up here.

39:19.090 --> 39:20.025
Us, too.

39:20.058 --> 39:22.060
MOSLEY:
Speak for yourself.
I broke a heel.

39:22.093 --> 39:24.696
(Souza groans)

39:25.931 --> 39:27.933
(indistinct police
radio chatter)

39:29.668 --> 39:33.672
After all this,
he can just leave.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.641
Hopefully, he
takes a magazine.

39:35.674 --> 39:37.943
That flight to Rio
is 16 hours.

39:37.976 --> 39:39.811
What he doesn't know is,
he's going back

39:39.845 --> 39:41.647
at the request
of his home country.

39:41.680 --> 39:43.649
Really? What changed?

39:43.682 --> 39:45.751
Well, somebody uploaded
the contents

39:45.784 --> 39:47.719
of Souza's personal cell phone

39:47.753 --> 39:50.822
to the Brazilian Ministry
of Foreign Affairs.

39:50.856 --> 39:53.925
Let's just say they were very
interested in what it contained.

39:53.959 --> 39:55.627
Okay.

39:57.128 --> 39:58.964
Watch your head.

39:58.997 --> 40:01.600
What's gonna happen to her?

40:01.633 --> 40:03.669
MOSLEY:
The Brazilian government
is extraditing her

40:03.702 --> 40:05.804
back to Sao Paulo.

40:05.837 --> 40:07.205
She's agreed to testify

40:07.238 --> 40:10.108
against him, which will,
obviously, help her case.

40:10.141 --> 40:11.810
CALLEN:
I talked to some
guys at the DEA.

40:11.843 --> 40:15.146
They'd like to give her a medal
for taking down Carvalho.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.148
Of course, that doesn't
really excuse her

40:17.182 --> 40:18.684
for tearing up the place.

40:18.717 --> 40:20.752
No, it does not.

40:20.786 --> 40:22.654
Well, kids.

40:22.688 --> 40:24.590
It's been a long day.
I'm gonna go home.

40:26.224 --> 40:29.695
I, uh, hope
Deeks did okay

40:29.728 --> 40:30.996
with that
sensitivity training.

40:31.029 --> 40:33.465
He's very sensitive now.

40:33.499 --> 40:36.034
Yeah. Sensitivity is important.

40:36.067 --> 40:37.869
Be sad if he wasn't.

40:37.903 --> 40:38.837
Later, Kensi.

40:38.870 --> 40:40.105
Hidoko, thank you.

40:48.279 --> 40:52.651
Kens, you, uh, you look
like you could use a drink.

40:52.684 --> 40:54.986
Yeah, I could use a drink,
but you know what?

40:55.020 --> 40:57.556
I got stuff to do, so I'll catch
you guys tomorrow, all right?

40:57.589 --> 40:58.724
I love you.

40:58.757 --> 40:59.825
All right.

40:59.858 --> 41:03.962
Well, partner, it looks
like it's just you and me.

41:05.764 --> 41:06.965
Uh...

41:06.998 --> 41:09.735
whatever happened with that girl
in the, uh, bar in Georgia?

41:09.768 --> 41:12.237
Uh, she tried
to kill me.

41:12.270 --> 41:13.872
Most do sooner or later.

41:13.905 --> 41:15.140
What can I say?

41:15.173 --> 41:16.808
I bring out the
passion in 'em.

41:16.842 --> 41:18.009
And the crazy.

41:18.043 --> 41:20.078
Yeah, that's true.

41:24.916 --> 41:26.284
Hey, baby.

41:26.317 --> 41:27.653
Hey.

41:27.686 --> 41:30.656
Oh. Whoa.

41:30.689 --> 41:32.724
What happened to you?

41:32.758 --> 41:34.860
Eh, nothing a little
Epsom salts can't fix.

41:34.893 --> 41:37.629
My God, look
at your nose.

41:37.663 --> 41:39.765
You look like
Owen Wilson.

41:39.798 --> 41:41.833
(laughing):
Thank you for that.

41:41.867 --> 41:44.670
Like Rocky after Clubber Lang
got hold of him.

41:44.703 --> 41:47.038
Yeah. It was not fun
getting my ass kicked today.

41:47.072 --> 41:49.174
But I did save
a life today.
Nice work.

41:49.207 --> 41:50.842
And I got to use
my Portuguese.

41:50.876 --> 41:53.912
Oh, wow. Can you give me
a sexy little sample of that?

41:53.945 --> 41:56.782
(speaking Portuguese)

41:56.815 --> 41:58.684
All I got was "pizza,"
but it was very sexy.

41:58.717 --> 42:00.051
It's all you need
to know, let's go.

42:00.085 --> 42:04.155
All right. Just one quick
request before we go.

42:04.189 --> 42:06.625
This is, uh, Guy's stolen stuff.

42:06.658 --> 42:08.560
Okay. What's this?

42:08.594 --> 42:10.061
That is his sketchbook.

42:10.095 --> 42:12.330
Go ahead and just take
a quick gander into there.

42:12.363 --> 42:13.932
What am I looking for?

42:13.965 --> 42:15.567
You'll know if you see it.

42:15.601 --> 42:17.102
Okay, some fruit.
Right.

42:17.135 --> 42:19.004
Zebra.
I love a good zebra.

42:19.037 --> 42:21.306
Uh... that's-- yep.
(gasps)

42:21.339 --> 42:23.642
Oh, my God,
is it my mom?

42:23.675 --> 42:25.811
(laughing):
Oh, it's your mom.
No!

42:25.844 --> 42:27.679
Oh, Deeks, please.
It's like Rose from Titanic.

42:27.713 --> 42:29.080
No. It's going
in the burn room.

42:29.114 --> 42:30.348
No. Deeks, no.
You cannot burn it.

42:30.381 --> 42:31.783
It is art.

42:31.817 --> 42:33.685
DEEKS:
It's not art. It's my mom.
