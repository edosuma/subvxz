all the Math homework you did.

a quick look around.

Uh, wait. Hold on.

around here some-- Oh!

17:07.579 --> 17:10.829
Ah, my Math homework
was in my Philosophy folder,

17:10.944 --> 17:13.650
which I may have turned
into a paper airplane.

17:18.444 --> 17:20.289
Axl, this is completely
illegible.

said he couldn't even read it.

Oh! Here we go.

all over this?

17:34.453 --> 17:36.095
where all the hot chicks
were sitting.

17:36.534 --> 17:37.947
So, you did nothing?

where she was sitting

17:42.047 --> 17:43.010
compared to
where I was sitting.

17:43.113 --> 17:44.244
That was not easy.

17:46.787 --> 17:48.941
You should really learn
from my mistakes, Brick.

17:49.282 --> 17:50.477
That's a lot to learn.

17:50.752 --> 17:52.395
Don't worry.
I know what we need to do.

17:54.754 --> 17:58.136
[ Groans ]
Why is this so hard?

17:58.294 --> 17:59.178
It's way too much work

17:59.282 --> 18:01.082
and I don't understand
how to do any of it.

18:01.179 --> 18:02.821
Honestly,
it's not that complex.

I promise
you'll get the hang of it.

18:06.955 --> 18:10.234
put this information
right up there...

and that is how you drop

and drop Philosophy on my own.

in this house?

We already got an evil rabbit.

who will take him.

that loves me.

19:07.329 --> 19:08.681
What are you talking about?

19:08.765 --> 19:09.730
I'm talking about the fact

19:09.825 --> 19:12.561
that Colin Firth
actually appreciates me.

19:12.722 --> 19:14.544
He listens
to what I have to say.

When is the last time
any of you listened to me, huh?

It's just "Mom, we need this,"
"Mom we need that."

"Dad, there's no toilet paper,"
said no one ever.

is something to make fun of.

in the pioneer days,"

her sweatpants backwards."

Okay. I'm sorry.

19:33.648 --> 19:34.360
I thought the word "Juicy"

19:34.446 --> 19:35.924
was supposed to go
on the front, okay?

19:36.075 --> 19:37.914
And I just laugh along
like it's all okay,

19:38.004 --> 19:39.410

and pick, pick, pick,

there's something

to hurt your feelings.

probably can't jump,

better than jump...

20:47.649 --> 20:49.558

to remember here

is sometimes people mess up,

and maybe they don't tell you
they messed up right away,

the right time,

when they do

eventually tell you,
it's good to remember
