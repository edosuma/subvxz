00:01.167 --> 00:05.570
Cops say the body washed up on the bay.
It could be Carlie Richardson.

00:05.638 --> 00:08.300
- And I'm supposed to know who that is?
- Yeah. Disappeared a year ago.

00:08.375 --> 00:11.833
She was pregnant. Oh, come on, Bones.
You have to get a TV, you know?

00:11.911 --> 00:15.278
Oh, hey, or at least just, uh, hey, thumb
through a <i>People</i> at the checkout stand.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.282
Was it in
the <i>Journal of Forensic Anthropology?</i>

00:17.350 --> 00:19.284
Oh, you know, I forgot
to renew my subscription.

00:19.352 --> 00:21.582
You know what?
You really need to take up other interests.

00:21.654 --> 00:24.589
I'm reading Ted Gioia's <i>History ofJazz.</i>
Was she mentioned in there?

00:24.657 --> 00:27.888
Or maybe in McGee's
<i>Science and Lore of the Kitchen?</i>

00:27.961 --> 00:30.691
Or perhaps I should develop an interest
in the mainstream media's...

00:30.764 --> 00:33.392
exploitation of crimes for
their entertainment value.

00:33.466 --> 00:36.629
You know, it's amazing, Bones.
You can really be snotty sometimes. [Laughs]

00:36.703 --> 00:39.570
- So, Carlie Richardson?
- Carlie Richardson, newlywed.

00:39.639 --> 00:41.664
Everyone assumed
that she was murdered.

00:41.741 --> 00:44.767
Husband was cheating on her. There was
evidence that they had a fight that day.

00:44.844 --> 00:48.143
He was covered in scratches. Witnesses said
that they saw him down by the marina.

00:48.214 --> 00:51.012
Yeah, but, hey, you know,
without the body, they had to kick him free.

00:51.084 --> 00:55.418
Well, if she's been in the water for a year,
the bones will be saturated.

00:55.488 --> 00:57.581
I'll need
nylon mesh bagging and...

00:57.657 --> 00:59.682
Cam's bringing in
everything on the truck.

00:59.759 --> 01:02.626
After a year, there's not gonna be
a lot of flesh for Cam.

01:02.695 --> 01:04.788
Well, you know, hey,
Bones, you know, Cam is...

01:04.864 --> 01:07.059
She's in charge now.
She runs the place. It's her call.

01:07.133 --> 01:12.002
- Then let's hurry.
I don't want my remains compromised.
- Okay. # [Humming]

01:12.072 --> 01:14.370
- I don't care if she's the boss.
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

01:14.441 --> 01:16.375
- [Sighs] The bones belong to me.
- Hey. Oh.

01:16.443 --> 01:19.173
Booth. Oh, yeah.
Rebecca.

01:19.245 --> 01:21.713
<i>Whoa, wait a second.</i>
<i>Slow down, okay?</i>

01:21.781 --> 01:24.147
This is my weekend with Parker,
okay? I am his father.

01:24.217 --> 01:27.209
<i>All right?</i>
<i>"Stu" is your boyfriend.</i>

01:27.287 --> 01:29.881
We're gonna be in the water.
Remember to bring Traxon and soluble tape.

01:29.956 --> 01:34.416
- <i>[Buzzer Buzzes]</i>
- Does she think I am new at this?
I developed the use ofTraxon...

01:34.494 --> 01:36.894
- On the phone, Bones.
- I know. Get off. We have to go.

01:36.963 --> 01:40.729
It's... Rebecca, he's spending a lot of time
with Parker, and I don't even know this guy.

01:40.800 --> 01:43.234
- She took Zack. Zack's mine.
- Because you know what?

01:43.303 --> 01:47.000
I just... I just want to make sure
that he's a good influence.

01:47.073 --> 01:51.407
The fact that he, you know, rocks your...
rocks your world, surprisingly, that...

01:51.478 --> 01:53.639
really, you know,
doesn't concern...

01:53.713 --> 01:56.375
- I'll just meet you there.
- Doesn't concern me.

01:56.449 --> 01:59.816
l-I gotta run. Okay, Rebecca?
We'll talk about this later.

01:59.886 --> 02:01.820
Bones, wait up.

02:01.888 --> 02:04.322
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>Why can't you go faster?</i>

02:04.390 --> 02:06.324
<i>I don't see why I couldn't drive.</i>

02:06.392 --> 02:08.326
- Because you're agitated.
- I am not.

02:08.394 --> 02:10.828
You've turned this into a competition
between you and Cam.

02:10.896 --> 02:14.094
I just like to be first on the scene.
That's all. To protect the evidence.

02:14.167 --> 02:16.328
She's not going to disturb anything.

02:16.402 --> 02:20.634
No, it's all tissue and blood
and D.N.A. with her.

02:20.707 --> 02:22.675
She doesn't appreciate
the skeletal system.

02:22.742 --> 02:24.903
You could take the l-70.
It'll be quicker.

02:24.978 --> 02:28.106
- Don't backseat drive, okay?
- Oh. I think I know who's agitated.

02:28.181 --> 02:30.376
[Chuckles]
Someone is annoying me, okay?

02:30.450 --> 02:32.213
- That's different.
- Your ex.

02:32.285 --> 02:35.516
- Huh?
- That's who's annoying you,
because she has a new man in her life.

02:35.588 --> 02:38.751
That's funny, you know?
Okay, I am concerned about my son.

02:38.825 --> 02:41.953
I want to know what kind of guy
this new boyfriend is.

02:42.028 --> 02:45.191
You know what? If she's not gonna tell me,
I'll find out on my own.

02:45.265 --> 02:48.962
- Are you gonna run a background check on him?
- You have kids and we'll talk.

02:49.035 --> 02:51.731
That's a lot to ask
for a little conversation.

02:51.804 --> 02:54.932
- If you make a right, we can cut through Grafton.
- Fine.

02:56.943 --> 02:58.740
[Chattering]

03:01.814 --> 03:04.715
We have no information right now.
[Continues, Indistinct]

<i>[Woman Dispatcher]</i>
<i>Go ahead, 114.</i>

03:17.497 --> 03:19.431
She beat us here.
She was in a truck.

03:19.499 --> 03:22.297
- You're the one who wanted
to go through Grafton.
- You could've used the siren.

03:22.368 --> 03:25.769
- Why do you have one
if you're not gonna use it?
- [Groans] What's that smell?

03:25.838 --> 03:28.636
Zack, I need some sterile tubes
before she's fertilizer.

03:28.708 --> 03:31.472
[Exhales]
Okay, that's the smell.

03:32.478 --> 03:37.142
Caucasian, female, 25 to 30.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.913
And barnacle and small mussel
incrustation...

03:39.986 --> 03:42.079
indicates she's been
in the water for about a year.

03:42.155 --> 03:45.056
Mm-mmm. <i>They</i> have.

03:46.893 --> 03:49.088
God.

03:49.162 --> 03:52.529
Size of the fetal bones
indicates the fetus was viable.

03:52.599 --> 03:55.033
- How could someone do this to their own kid?
- <i>[Zack] Multiple fractures.</i>

03:55.101 --> 03:59.561
<i>They could be from an assault or from being</i>
<i>battered by rocks and debris while in the water.</i>

03:59.639 --> 04:04.042
Stab wounds evident on ribs,
manubrium and clavicle.

04:04.110 --> 04:07.341
And ulna, radius.
One to the sphenoids.

04:07.413 --> 04:10.007
<i>[Woman Screaming]</i>

04:10.083 --> 04:12.847

- Not yet. Scoop guys just got here.

04:15.388 --> 04:19.188
<i>Then tell them to look for a left leg</i>
<i>and missing fetal bones.</i>

04:19.259 --> 04:22.285
[Sighs]
Looks like we finally get to put Richardson away.

04:22.362 --> 04:24.853
- I love being a hero.
- A heroine.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.365
Mmm, sounds too druggy.
I'm going with hero.

04:28.401 --> 04:29.993
Wh... Whoa.
What are you doing?

04:30.069 --> 04:32.003
Scraping the adipocere
from the hand.

04:32.071 --> 04:35.302
No. You could compromise the bones.
You should use suction back at the lab...

04:35.375 --> 04:37.309
if you want a conviction.

04:37.377 --> 04:41.211
- Of course, it's your call.
- Are we gonna have another murder here or what?

04:41.281 --> 04:44.614
No, no. I have the utmost respect
for the doc.

04:44.684 --> 04:47.847
- Glad she works for me.
- <i>[Horn Honking]</i>

04:47.920 --> 04:52.380

He saw this, and then he took off.

<i>I tried to stop him,</i>
<i>but then he hit me.</i>

Cam, this is the evidence taken
from Kyle Richardson's house a year ago.

So, we got rope,
the plastic sheeting...

Richardson's D.N.A. results.

- Looks like he's not walking this time, Seeley.
- Ironic, since he's running now.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.608
Hodgins, you know Booth
is bigger than you, right?

06:20.680 --> 06:24.172
Right.
Wasn't your fault, dude.

<i>Let's focus, people.</i>
<i>This should be a slam dunk.</i>

06:27.854 --> 06:30.789
We screw this up, I'm gonna look like a fool,
and someone's gonna have to pay.

06:30.857 --> 06:32.791
We just started collecting evidence.

06:32.859 --> 06:36.420
<i>There are boxes of evidence.</i>
<i>The remains are icing on the cake.</i>

06:36.496 --> 06:38.327
Let's just hand the prosecutor
what she needs...

06:38.398 --> 06:41.026
so I can have a nice weekend
knockin' back shots and playing poker.

06:41.100 --> 06:43.466
[Scoffs]
Yeah, that should motivate us.

06:43.536 --> 06:45.470
I'm gonna strip
the flesh and adipocere.

06:45.538 --> 06:47.597
Remove anything from
under the fingernails.

06:47.673 --> 06:49.834
There was a dead fish
in the plastic.

06:49.909 --> 06:53.777
Ooh! And it's not even my birthday.

06:53.846 --> 06:55.677
- You saved the fish?
- Yeah.

<i>The stomach contents and particulates</i>
<i>could give us drift patterns...</i>

show where she was left
before she washed ashore.

07:00.753 --> 07:05.019
Not much left of the organs.
Looks like I can still find a few surprises...

07:05.091 --> 07:07.116
from what's left of this lung.

07:07.193 --> 07:10.458
- Looks like some liver here.
- I'll take any tissue that's stuck to the plastic.

07:10.530 --> 07:13.226
There'll be sediment
and organic particulates.

07:13.299 --> 07:15.529

<i>the skulls are reconstructed.</i>

07:20.740 --> 07:23.140
Zack will start on them right away.

07:23.209 --> 07:26.872
After you've stripped any tissue, I'd like
to reassemble the victim and the fetus.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.278
Sounds like fun.
Let's do it.

07:45.331 --> 07:47.265
It was male.

07:47.333 --> 07:50.928
"He". Not "it", Bones.

<i>I'm gonna go talk to his girlfriend.</i>
<i>No mistakes on this one.</i>

He always was a little touchy.

07:59.445 --> 08:01.436
Yeah.

08:09.722 --> 08:12.691
I... I didn't know Kyle then.

08:12.758 --> 08:16.956
We started going out
after his wife went missing.

08:17.029 --> 08:19.088
Did he ever mention
the night she disappeared?

08:19.165 --> 08:22.225
Of course. I mean,
it was terrible for him.

08:22.301 --> 08:25.634
I just tried to support him
and help him get past it.

08:25.705 --> 08:30.768
He looks like he had
a lot of people to help him.

08:30.843 --> 08:33.971
I mean, he looked really,
really broken up.

08:35.780 --> 08:37.715
I know he dated other women.

08:37.783 --> 08:40.081
But he is not who you think he is.

08:40.152 --> 08:42.143
Nah, of course not.

08:48.461 --> 08:51.157
- Oh, my God.
- Agent Booth, is that necessary?

08:51.230 --> 08:54.893
- Just trying to help her remember.
- He would <i>never</i> do this.

08:54.967 --> 08:58.164
- He could never do this!
- He hit you when he was leaving, didn't he?

08:58.237 --> 09:01.468
<i>[Stammers]</i>
<i>That is because I wanted to go with him.</i>

09:01.541 --> 09:04.908
A-And he knew everyone would be after him.
He was just trying to protect me.

Yeah, he's a real prince.

09:08.648 --> 09:12.641
<i>lfhe contacts you, call.</i>

09:12.718 --> 09:15.619
Otherwise, you're looking at
obstruction of justice, aiding and abetting...

09:15.688 --> 09:17.713
and I'm sure we could find
a few other charges...

09:17.790 --> 09:20.884
to make it worth the money
you're paying your lawyer.

09:22.895 --> 09:26.729
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>There's another gash on the second rib, right side...</i>

09:26.799 --> 09:29.597
<i>approximately 45 degrees,</i>
<i>left to right.</i>

09:31.537 --> 09:34.506
- Why didn't he divorce her?
- Why did they get married in the first place?

09:34.574 --> 09:36.508
It's an antiquated ritual.

09:36.576 --> 09:40.444
Carlie Richardson believed in it,
trusted her husband, and look what happened.

09:40.513 --> 09:42.606
So this is marriage's fault?

09:42.682 --> 09:46.049
Committing yourself to one person
isn't in the interest of the species.

09:46.118 --> 09:48.552
I mean, you have multiple partners.

09:48.621 --> 09:51.556
Don't say it like that.
I date.

09:51.624 --> 09:55.390
The notion of a committed relationship,
it's fantasy.

09:55.461 --> 09:59.864
<i>Look at Booth. Fighting with his ex.</i>
<i>His son caught in the middle.</i>

09:59.932 --> 10:01.957
We make our lives
out of chaos and hope...

10:02.034 --> 10:04.730

10:04.804 --> 10:07.136
Someday you'll meet somebody.

10:07.206 --> 10:09.766
I don't need anything more
than I have now.

10:09.842 --> 10:12.333
Talk about a fantasy.

10:12.411 --> 10:16.814
<i>The skulls are in multiple pieces, but</i>
<i>the damage is from debris in the water.</i>

10:16.882 --> 10:18.975
Then let's start on the stab wounds.

10:19.051 --> 10:22.179
I'd like you to confirm
the type of knife used in each of these.

10:22.254 --> 10:25.815
These all appear to be from the knife that was
missing from the set taken from Richardson's.

10:25.891 --> 10:28.985
Appear? No conclusions
without corroboration.

10:29.061 --> 10:32.519
But Dr. Saroyan seems certain
that Richardson...

10:32.598 --> 10:35.066
- Seems? You're my grad student. You work for me.
- <i>[Footsteps Approaching]</i>

<i>not getting our rocks off on research.</i>

You're serious?

10:45.411 --> 10:48.005
Okay.

10:48.080 --> 10:51.072
Brought your hand back. I found
organic material under the fingernails.

10:51.150 --> 10:54.551
<i>Should match Richardson. And I found</i>
<i>something else I'd like you to look at.</i>

10:55.655 --> 10:59.250
<i>It's here in the lung.</i>
<i>It's a locket.</i>

10:59.325 --> 11:01.316
<i>It must've been around her neck...</i>

11:01.394 --> 11:05.194
and melted into the lung
during putrefaction.

11:05.264 --> 11:08.062
Before I remove it,
I wanted to see...

11:08.134 --> 11:10.864
if any of your cyborgs could do anything
with the photo paper.

11:10.936 --> 11:13.598
There's not enough left.
It's liquefied.

11:16.008 --> 11:19.466
It's probably just another picture
of the lovebirds anyway.

11:20.780 --> 11:22.771
<i>Oh, what's this?</i>

11:31.691 --> 11:34.751
- <i>Oh, no.</i>
- Who's Kenny?

11:34.827 --> 11:38.058
I don't know. I don't want to know.
I just want it to be Richardson.

11:38.130 --> 11:40.758
That's right,
because of the drinking and the poker.

11:43.536 --> 11:45.731
Yeah, I know there's
a lot of animals at the zoo.

11:45.805 --> 11:48.535
The monkeys...
The monkeys are Daddy's favorite.

11:48.607 --> 11:50.973
Did you see... They're just like people.
[Imitating Monkey]

11:51.043 --> 11:54.012
Actually, three million
base pairs of the genome...

11:54.080 --> 11:57.516
differ in protein encoding
and other functional areas.

11:57.583 --> 12:01.417
- What?
- Genetic differences between chimps and humans.

12:01.487 --> 12:03.955
I'm talking to
a four-year-old, Bones.

12:04.023 --> 12:06.082
Oh. Yeah.

12:06.158 --> 12:09.685
You're spending a lot of time with Drew, huh?
Oh, that's great.

12:09.762 --> 12:13.323
Okay, you gotta go eat. Okay, go eat.
Make sure... Okay, I love...

12:14.700 --> 12:17.669
- Yeah.
- New boyfriend spending
a lot of time with your son?

12:17.737 --> 12:19.671
Yeah.

12:19.739 --> 12:21.798
So you got any new information
for me, Bones?

12:21.874 --> 12:23.705
- I'm sorry.
- Ah, there's no need.

12:23.776 --> 12:26.711
It must be hard not being able
to see him when you want to.

12:26.779 --> 12:29.077
See, this is information
that I already know, Bones.

12:29.148 --> 12:32.777
Why don't you...
Let's say we just discuss the case, hmm?

12:32.852 --> 12:35.047
- Sure.
- Mm-hmm.

12:35.121 --> 12:39.182
You know, I'm his father.
You know, Parker knows that.

12:39.258 --> 12:43.058
I mean, that-that's what's important,
not some stupid trip to the zoo.

12:43.129 --> 12:45.359
- No, absolutely.
- Right.

12:45.431 --> 12:46.398
- Yeah.
- Done.

12:46.465 --> 12:48.558
- Of course.
- Boom.

12:51.303 --> 12:53.828
We found this in her lung.

12:53.906 --> 12:56.773
What?

12:56.842 --> 13:00.471
- Her lung?
- It was enveloped during decomp.

13:00.546 --> 13:04.915
- "Kenny"?
- Any reference to a Kenny in the case file?

13:04.984 --> 13:07.578
No, but whoever Kenny is
liked her enough to get her a locket.

13:07.653 --> 13:09.587
Maybe Kyle wasn't the only one
who was cheating.

13:09.655 --> 13:11.680
- Opens up a lot of possibilities.
- Yeah.

13:11.757 --> 13:16.694
What do you say we just go talk to
Carlie's friends and see if they know who Kenny is?

13:16.762 --> 13:18.696
[Sighs]

13:19.064 --> 13:22.431
<i>The four of us got so close</i>
<i>being in the same Lamaze class.</i>

13:22.501 --> 13:24.992
Losing Carlie was
like losing a sister.

13:25.070 --> 13:27.436
<i>It was her idea to start</i>
<i>this baby group.</i>

13:27.506 --> 13:29.440
We all felt so connected.

13:29.508 --> 13:32.272
Feeling someone growing inside,
waiting to meet them.

13:32.344 --> 13:35.711
- Do you have kids?
- He does.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.578
They make you feel whole.

13:37.650 --> 13:40.949
It's just a release of serotonin
necessary for the survival of the species.

13:41.020 --> 13:45.354
- Huh?
- Never mind.
Um, we found this locket on Carlie's remains.

13:45.424 --> 13:48.860
It says, uh, "I love you, Kenny."
Did she ever mention a Kenny?

13:48.928 --> 13:51.624
- Yes.
- She talked about Kenny all the time.

13:51.697 --> 13:54.222
- He was never mentioned in the police report.
- Kenny was her dog.

13:54.300 --> 13:56.234
<i>Her dog?</i>

13:56.302 --> 13:59.601
Kyle bought her the dog when things were
better between them. She <i>loved</i> that dog.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.970
<i>There used to be a picture</i>
<i>of them in there.</i>

14:02.041 --> 14:04.373
Well, where is her dog now?

14:04.443 --> 14:06.411
It died.
Mary took care of it.

14:06.478 --> 14:10.437
I'm a vet. They brought it in a few months
before Carlie disappeared.

14:10.516 --> 14:13.246
- Kyle said he backed over it accidentally.
- [Fussing]

14:13.319 --> 14:15.719
Carlie always felt
he did it on purpose.

14:15.788 --> 14:18.256
He was a real piece of work
when he got mad.

14:21.527 --> 14:23.688
A dead dog. Excellent.

14:23.762 --> 14:27.562
- So we're back to one suspect: Richardson.
- I like this. Good work.

14:27.633 --> 14:31.296
- Do you want children?
- What?

14:31.370 --> 14:33.736
Children?

14:33.806 --> 14:36.001
Maybe, if I could find one
that sleeps late and cleans.

14:36.075 --> 14:38.009
Does this apply
to the case in any way?

14:38.077 --> 14:40.011
No, just curious.

14:40.079 --> 14:42.570
Most people think it's odd when
a woman doesn't want children.

14:42.648 --> 14:45.981
But, obviously, you don't.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.781
Are you pregnant?

14:48.854 --> 14:51.618
- No. [Chuckles] I'm not. No.
- Why are you looking at me?

14:51.690 --> 14:55.524
Well, as long as you're not leaving the lab
every two minutes to pee.

14:55.594 --> 14:57.687
No intention of it.

14:57.763 --> 15:00.960
So all this back-and-forth was for nothing?
Good to know.

15:01.033 --> 15:05.936
<i>Now, unless the liver has a written confession</i>
<i>in it by a pet parakeet...</i>

15:06.005 --> 15:10.203
we should have enough to build a solid forensic
case against Richardson for the prosecutor.

15:10.276 --> 15:12.642
<i>I found something that might</i>
<i>put a new wrinkle in things.</i>

15:12.711 --> 15:16.112
- Great.
- Oh, God.

15:16.181 --> 15:18.115
<i>The fish was</i>
<i>a Pomatomus saltatrix...</i>

15:18.183 --> 15:20.117
a bluefish common to Delaware Bay.

15:20.185 --> 15:24.747
And there were dinoflagellates consistent
with the salt water in the bay.

15:24.823 --> 15:28.486
- Dozing off, Hodgepodge.
- But I also found <i>Didinium,</i> a ciliate...

15:28.560 --> 15:33.224
<i>and oomycota, a mold,</i>
<i>both of which are found in freshwater.</i>

15:33.299 --> 15:35.961
So the body was in
fresh and salt water.

15:36.035 --> 15:38.230
Exactly. Freshwater first
for at least six months.

15:38.304 --> 15:40.795
Okay, we have witnesses that put
Richardson at the marina that night.

15:40.873 --> 15:43.501
There is no freshwater in that area.

15:43.575 --> 15:47.204
- So maybe Richardson didn't do it.
- [Sighs]

15:47.279 --> 15:48.644
[Sighs]

15:54.687 --> 15:57.986
What the hell's going on here?
Richardson's the only logical suspect.

15:58.057 --> 16:00.457
- Are we working for the defense now?
- I'm working for the victims.

16:00.526 --> 16:03.086
We have to be open to the evidence
as it presents itself.

16:03.162 --> 16:05.653
The knife, the rope, the plastic sheeting
are all from Richardson's house.

16:05.731 --> 16:08.529
That's been confirmed.
We're trying to build a case here, people.

16:08.600 --> 16:11.433
Don't ignore facts just because
it might change the outcome of the case.

16:11.503 --> 16:13.903
Not asking you to.
I want you to fill in the blanks.

16:13.973 --> 16:16.635
There must be freshwater close enough
for Richardson to have dumped the body.

16:16.709 --> 16:19.769
It has to have the same sediment,
larvae, archaea, helminths.

16:19.845 --> 16:22.370
Great. Whatever the "hell-minths"
those are, find them.

16:22.448 --> 16:25.906
If we find a body of water that matches,
it has to be dredged for additional parts.

16:25.985 --> 16:29.182
We're still missing the left patella, tibia
and calcaneus. And the fetus...

16:29.254 --> 16:32.655
Okay, fine.
Just stop talking and do it.

16:34.793 --> 16:37.421
Hey, so, is this the only
freshwater near the bay?

16:37.496 --> 16:39.862
The only body of water that might
have algae and sediment...

16:39.932 --> 16:43.197
that could match what
we found on the remains.

16:43.268 --> 16:46.066
<i>Whoo! Seems to be</i>
<i>a lot of Gamophyta.</i>

16:46.138 --> 16:49.574
- Is that good?
- I won't know until I compare it
to the samples in the lab.

16:49.641 --> 16:52.576
- Then why'd you act so excited?
- I guess I just like Gamophyta.

16:52.644 --> 16:54.839
<i>You know, you really don't</i>
<i>have to act any geekier.</i>

16:54.913 --> 16:56.972
The whole outfit does it for you.

16:57.049 --> 17:00.746
Geek chic, dude.
Agent Blondie over there thinks I'm hot.

17:00.819 --> 17:03.481
- How you doin'?
- [Chuckles]

17:06.025 --> 17:09.118
- Anything?
- Another Top-Flite!

17:12.031 --> 17:15.090
You know, I went out with a woman
who had a little kid once.

17:15.166 --> 17:17.761
- Aren't you supposed to be looking for slime?
- The kid hated me.

17:17.836 --> 17:20.099
- Said I used too many big words.
- He got that right.

17:20.172 --> 17:23.835
Hit me in the head with a Tonka truck.
Ah, I could never sleep with his mom again.

17:23.909 --> 17:26.138
Well, you know,
at least the story ends well.

17:26.211 --> 17:29.942
I was good to him though. I did not deserve
an 18-wheeler to the parietal bone.

17:30.015 --> 17:32.142
Ooh! Nematodes and planaria.

17:32.217 --> 17:34.151
<i>Does that mean anything?</i>

17:34.219 --> 17:36.449
- Not sure.
- [Sighs]

17:36.522 --> 17:38.683
Anything?

17:38.757 --> 17:40.987
Bones. Could be from the fetus.

17:41.060 --> 17:43.824
<i>Hamate, triquetral,</i>
<i>portions of the phalanges.</i>

17:43.896 --> 17:47.161
And another Top-Flite!

17:47.232 --> 17:49.029
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>Yeah, check to the side.</i>

17:50.702 --> 17:52.829
According to the reconstruction
with these new bones...

17:52.905 --> 17:55.965
the fetus has seven fingers.

17:56.041 --> 17:57.975
And two right hands.

17:58.043 --> 18:00.034
I don't understand.
Was there another victim?

18:00.112 --> 18:02.103
Double the magnification.

18:06.618 --> 18:10.850
Okay, look at the structure
of the phalanges.

18:10.923 --> 18:15.360
- Ah. The bones from the lake are from a raccoon.
- Mm-hmm.

18:15.427 --> 18:18.919
The formation of the hands
is almost identical to an infant's hand.

18:18.997 --> 18:22.296
- How did you do?
- I found a raccoon. You?

18:22.367 --> 18:25.894
Sediment and organic material from the lake
doesn't match what was taken from the remains.

18:25.971 --> 18:28.667
I have to look for another body of freshwater.
I don't think it's around.

18:28.740 --> 18:31.504
- What have you got?
- Nothing.

18:31.577 --> 18:34.307
The next body of freshwater
that might match is over 60 miles away.

18:34.379 --> 18:37.041
<i>Richardson couldn't have been there.</i>
<i>It wouldn't match the timeline.</i>

18:37.116 --> 18:40.779
I've got the board of theJeffersonian,
the federal prosecutor and Nancy Grace...

18:40.853 --> 18:43.515
ready to devour me if I don't hand them
enough to indict Richardson.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.489
Well, if you want us
to manufacture evidence...

18:45.557 --> 18:47.491
I want us to find out
who killed Carlie.

18:47.559 --> 18:50.494
I'm pissed 'cause whoever did it
is messing with me, and I don't like that.

18:50.562 --> 18:52.496
I like doing the messing.

18:52.564 --> 18:56.022
- <i>Then we have to determine whether</i>
<i>we're wasting our time on Richardson.</i>
- Tell me what you need.

18:56.368 --> 19:01.635
<i>His plates were found in a ditch on Route 432,</i>
<i>his car in a vacant lot in Huntsville.</i>

19:01.707 --> 19:04.574
He could be using another car,
or he could be hiding out.

19:04.643 --> 19:07.840
- Anybody I.D. him?
- We've got I.D.'s coming in from all over the place.

19:07.913 --> 19:10.347
This is where the concerned citizens
all come out for the reward.

19:10.415 --> 19:13.043
- <i>[Door Opens]</i>
- Excuse us. Agent Booth?

19:13.118 --> 19:16.281
- Let me know if you find something else.
- Sure.

19:19.591 --> 19:23.186
I'm Dennis Campbell. This is my wife, Patricia.
We're Carlie's parents.

19:23.262 --> 19:25.958
Yes, I know.
Please, sit down.

19:28.767 --> 19:30.758
I'm so sorry for your loss.

19:30.836 --> 19:34.602
Well, at least now our daughter can rest with
her baby, and Kyle can never touch them again.

19:34.673 --> 19:39.201
- The reason we're here...
- We were going through
some photos for the funeral...

19:39.278 --> 19:41.872
and we came across this one.

19:41.947 --> 19:44.211
<i>[Dennis]</i>
<i>Kyle used to go out of town on business.</i>

19:44.283 --> 19:47.946
<i>His firm had an office in Boston.</i>
<i>Carlie went with him once.</i>

19:48.020 --> 19:50.454
This is them with
some people in Boston.

19:50.522 --> 19:54.583
That woman on the news, Karen Tyler,
she said she met Kyle <i>after</i> Carlie disappeared.

19:54.660 --> 19:57.891
But-But here she is looking at him.

19:57.963 --> 20:00.761
He admitted to being involved
with those other girls.

20:00.832 --> 20:02.959
Why did he lie about knowing her?

20:03.035 --> 20:05.060
- May I keep this photo?
- Of course.

20:05.137 --> 20:08.163
We need them to answer for this.

20:08.240 --> 20:11.607
She was our little girl.

20:11.677 --> 20:13.907
<i>She wasn't supposed to go before us.</i>

20:13.979 --> 20:16.709
That's not the way
it's supposed to be.

20:17.716 --> 20:23.018
I know. We'll find Kyle.
I promise.

20:30.996 --> 20:34.090
- You want me to what?
- Stab the body for me.

20:34.166 --> 20:37.693
We need to match force with the injuries
recorded on the remains.

20:37.769 --> 20:39.703
Okay, I'm stabbing the body.

20:39.771 --> 20:42.433
Well, it's a replica.
We're all going to do it.

20:42.507 --> 20:44.839
You're just the closest
to Kyle Richardson.

20:44.910 --> 20:46.844
Okay. That's great.
I'll be there in 20.

20:46.912 --> 20:49.176
But in the future, you have to
ask me differently, Bones.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.706
Because you know what? Come over to
your place to stab a body... That is just freaky.

20:52.784 --> 20:56.447
- Seeley, you son of a bitch.
- Oh. I... Rebecca. Wow. You look great.

20:56.521 --> 20:59.217
Save it, 'cause I need a lot more
than compliments right now.

20:59.291 --> 21:02.192
Okay. Just keep it down a little bit.
'Cause I'm at work. All right?

21:02.261 --> 21:05.492
You sent agents to investigate Drew?
Because you're gonna stop that now.

21:05.564 --> 21:08.362
Listen. I'm just being cautious.
What do you really know about this guy anyway?

21:08.433 --> 21:10.867
I know... l-l-I know
that he has a good job.

21:10.936 --> 21:14.133
And I know that he fixes stuff
around the house when he says he's going to.

21:14.206 --> 21:16.140
And I know that Parker
is crazy about him...

21:16.208 --> 21:19.336
and he's not terrified every time
he goes to work that he's going to get shot.

21:19.411 --> 21:22.005
And I know that I love him.

21:22.080 --> 21:24.446
I love him.

21:24.516 --> 21:26.507
And now everyone at work
thinks he's a criminal.

21:26.585 --> 21:29.110
- Well, he's been spotted with explosives.
- He is a construction foreman.

21:29.187 --> 21:32.384
He does demolition. You must've figured that out
when you were doing all your snooping.

21:32.457 --> 21:36.393
I have a right to know who's around my son.
He spends more time with Parker than I do.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.520
Okay, you think that
I would put Parker in danger?

21:38.597 --> 21:42.863
Let me ask you a question. Why is it you keep
all the men in your life such a secret?

21:42.934 --> 21:47.064
Because you always interrogate them
or intimidate them, and it freaks them out!

21:47.139 --> 21:50.040
A lot are a little strange.
The guy with the tattoos on his neck?

21:50.108 --> 21:53.339
[Stammers]
I don't even have to let you see Parker, okay?

21:53.412 --> 21:57.246
Not-Not-Not legally. That-That's one
of the upsides of not being married.

21:57.316 --> 21:59.284
Don't.

21:59.351 --> 22:01.683
I'm a good father.
You know that.

22:03.789 --> 22:05.780
You have got to stop
trying to run things.

22:05.857 --> 22:09.122
I've got things in my life that
have nothing to do with you.

22:09.194 --> 22:13.927
Look. We are always gonna have something
to do with each other because we share a son.

22:13.999 --> 22:16.160
Drew's a good man.

22:16.234 --> 22:19.795
And you need to back off, or you're
not gonna see Parker again. I swear.

22:21.673 --> 22:23.937
Back off.

22:34.486 --> 22:37.421
- Here comes Kyle.
- Ha, ha. Funny. Don't we have something to stab?

22:37.489 --> 22:41.152
- This. I hate my job.
- From the depth of the stab wounds...

22:41.226 --> 22:44.161
we can tell the approximate force
required in newton meters...

22:44.229 --> 22:46.163
to inflict the marks
we see on the bones.

22:46.231 --> 22:50.133
So we have to measure the amount of force
generated when we stab...

22:50.202 --> 22:53.171
to give us the size, weight
and body type of the assailant.

22:53.238 --> 22:55.172
Mm-hmm. You had to dress her up?

22:55.240 --> 22:58.767
The clothes she wore figure
in the resistance to the blows.

22:58.844 --> 23:02.075
The knife is consistent with
the one that caused the wounds.

23:02.147 --> 23:04.877
We fitted it with
an instrumented blade...

23:04.950 --> 23:07.783
that will give us a digital readout of
the newton meters of each stab.

23:07.853 --> 23:10.344
It's a dual-mass drop system.

23:10.422 --> 23:12.014
All I hear is blah, blah, blah.

23:12.090 --> 23:14.581
<i>CliffsNotes version:</i>
<i>We all stab. One of us is the killer.</i>

23:14.659 --> 23:17.355
- Thank you.
- Sort of like a real creepy party game.

23:17.429 --> 23:22.196
The violence of the attack shows rage.
So everyone should stab as hard as they can.

23:25.537 --> 23:27.266
[Grunting]

23:27.339 --> 23:29.967
[Grunting]

23:30.842 --> 23:33.504
This better work!

23:38.984 --> 23:42.112
- That was weird.
- [Shuddering]

23:43.889 --> 23:47.518
- Okay. Okay. [Chuckles]
- <i>[Booth] Results?</i>

23:47.592 --> 23:50.959
The force used to make
the injuries on the bones...

23:51.029 --> 23:54.294
was 24 newton meters.

23:54.366 --> 23:58.530
<i>And the winner is,</i>
<i>with 24 newton meters...</i>

24:00.071 --> 24:02.369
Angela.

24:02.441 --> 24:04.170
- What?
- <i>[Hodgins] Congratulations.</i>

24:04.242 --> 24:06.836
- Really?
- Height and weight?

24:06.912 --> 24:09.403
Oh, God. Uh... Uh...

24:09.481 --> 24:13.679
[Sighs] 5'8", 100 and...
[Mutters] hundred.

24:13.752 --> 24:17.483
- What?
- 135. It's all muscle.

24:17.556 --> 24:22.493
<i>Karen Tyler is 5'7 " and 132 pounds.</i>

24:22.561 --> 24:24.859
[Screaming]

24:24.930 --> 24:27.160
So, Kyle's girlfriend kills Carlie
so they can be together.

24:27.232 --> 24:30.065
- Well, then why did Kyle run?
- <i>[Saroyan] Maybe he didn't.</i>

24:30.135 --> 24:32.365
<i>It sounds nuts,</i>
<i>but if she's the killer...</i>

24:32.437 --> 24:34.997
maybe Karen got rid of him too
to keep him from talking.

24:42.848 --> 24:45.783
Okay, so you're sure there's no way
Richardson could've made these wounds?

24:45.851 --> 24:49.048
With his strength, the blows
would've sliced deeper into the bone.

24:49.120 --> 24:53.784
- These seem to go right through.
- <i>Well, those were delivered</i>
<i>after she was on the ground.</i>

24:53.859 --> 24:58.319
<i>So Karen does the killing because they know</i>
<i>everyone will be suspecting Kyle.</i>

24:58.396 --> 25:01.092
- I'd prefer not to make any more assumptions.
- Oh.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.259
There are particles
in the knife marks.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.769
When she was on the ground,
the knife passed through the body...

25:05.837 --> 25:07.771
and picked up sediment
from the dirt.

25:07.839 --> 25:10.171
The next stab embedded
that into the bone.

25:10.242 --> 25:12.176
If I can get enough information
from these particulates...

25:12.244 --> 25:14.474
I might be able to locate
the site of the murder.

25:14.546 --> 25:16.707
D.N.A. results came back.
It was Kyle under her nails.

25:16.781 --> 25:18.146
- So he was there too.
- Maybe.

25:18.216 --> 25:21.151
But we know he had a fight
with her earlier that he admits.

25:21.219 --> 25:24.780
Fortunately, there was also the skin
of somebody else. Tests showed it was a woman.

25:24.856 --> 25:26.881
Mmm. Karen Tyler.

25:26.958 --> 25:30.450
- We should get her D.N.A. drawn
as soon as possible.
- Smart. Let's go, Bones.

25:31.897 --> 25:34.593
<i>l- I didn't do it. I swear,</i>
<i>I would never hurt her.</i>

25:34.666 --> 25:36.930
The other day you said
you and Kyle didn't know each other...

25:37.002 --> 25:38.833
<i>until</i> after <i>Carlie disappeared.</i>

25:38.904 --> 25:40.633
Because we both knew
what everyone would think.

25:40.705 --> 25:42.434
Karen, please don't say anything.

25:42.507 --> 25:44.975
Hmm. Even your lawyer
thinks you did it.

25:45.043 --> 25:47.341
<i>Kyle thought we should separate</i>
<i>and meet in a few months...</i>

25:47.412 --> 25:50.074
so, you know,
it wouldn't look so bad.

25:50.148 --> 25:53.083
- Well, that didn't work out now, did it?
- Open your mouth.

25:53.151 --> 25:55.415
Do I really have to do this?

25:55.487 --> 25:57.455
They have a warrant.

25:57.522 --> 26:00.787
When you were sleeping with Kyle, didn't it
matter to you you were destroying a family?

26:00.859 --> 26:02.793
We were in love.

26:02.861 --> 26:06.854
Oh. Love. Sorry.
Now it's a beautiful story.

26:06.932 --> 26:09.867
- Open again.
- Ouch.

26:09.935 --> 26:12.426
- Oops.
- <i>Kyle was gonna tell her.</i>

26:12.504 --> 26:16.099
- We were gonna be honest.
- Mmm. 'Cause, you know, you do that so well.

26:16.174 --> 26:18.665
I would <i>never</i> hurt her.

26:18.743 --> 26:20.938
And neither would Kyle.

26:21.012 --> 26:25.381
Kyle. Right. The love of your life
who no one has seen for two days.

26:25.450 --> 26:28.715
Can you see why
I'm leery of relationships?

26:28.787 --> 26:30.846
<i>[Door Opens, Closes]</i>

26:30.922 --> 26:34.016
<i>We hit pay dirt.</i>
<i>Actually, we hit silt...</i>

26:34.092 --> 26:37.220
containing the feces of the gypsy moth,
some quartz and mica.

26:37.295 --> 26:40.526
That and the zinc levels in
the dinoflagellates from the freshwater...

26:40.599 --> 26:44.433
as well the Pinaceae pollen
led us to a patch of pitch pines...

26:44.502 --> 26:47.665
outside of Gloucester City,
New Jersey.

26:47.739 --> 26:49.730
<i>[Angela]</i>
<i>She was killed right here.</i>

26:49.808 --> 26:52.572
- Then when did they move her to the bay?
- They didn't.

26:52.644 --> 26:57.377
They left her in New Jersey in the Rancocas Creek.
She made it to the bay on her own.

26:57.449 --> 26:59.917
- What, did she take the shuttle?
- <i>Basically.</i>

26:59.985 --> 27:03.352
Two days after Carlie disappeared,
there were thunderstorms in New Jersey.

27:03.421 --> 27:05.355
Heavy, heavy rains.

27:05.423 --> 27:09.416
The body must have been flushed down
the Rancocas and into the Delaware River.

27:09.494 --> 27:14.227
Then she slowly made her way
down the Delaware and into the bay.

27:14.299 --> 27:17.757
The movement and the battering
on the rocks loosened her weight...

27:17.836 --> 27:21.203
so she floated to the surface
and washed ashore.

27:21.272 --> 27:24.105
I'm pretty sure Karen
didn't see that comin'.

27:37.355 --> 27:41.451
- Now, you're sure this is it?
- <i>Zinc, mica, feces. This is the place.</i>

27:41.526 --> 27:44.984
- Oh, it's beautiful here.
- Yeah, because, you know,
that's important for a murder.

27:45.063 --> 27:47.088
The bodies were wrapped
on the bank of the river.

27:47.165 --> 27:49.326
- Sift the soil for the missing bones.
- Yes, ma'am.

27:49.401 --> 27:52.029
<i>Agent Booth. Over here.</i>

27:56.174 --> 27:59.234
<i>Look at that... "C.R."</i>
<i>Carlie Richardson's initials.</i>

27:59.310 --> 28:02.211
Ugh.

28:07.652 --> 28:11.816
You don't pack face cream and a nightgown
if you're being abducted.

28:11.890 --> 28:15.553
A lot of vacation cabins nearby. If she was upset,
this would be a good place to unwind.

28:15.627 --> 28:18.892
Well, Karen Tyler said
that she liked Carlie.

28:18.963 --> 28:21.830
She could've befriended her
to lure her up here.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.425
Maybe Carlie's friends knew...

28:24.502 --> 28:28.063
that she and Karen
were getting chummy.

28:28.139 --> 28:31.768
- Did Carlie know about her?
- I thought they just started going out.

28:31.843 --> 28:33.902
No. They knew each other
from before.

28:35.513 --> 28:37.845
- Bastard.
- Carlie knew Kyle was cheating on her.

28:37.916 --> 28:41.682
- That's why they were fighting.
- And why she didn't want the baby.

28:41.753 --> 28:44.085
- Did she say that?
- <i>I don't care what's happening.</i>

28:44.155 --> 28:47.022
To say you don't want your child
when you're getting ready to give birth?

28:47.092 --> 28:49.993
- It's not right.
- <i>[Mary] I think I did see this woman.</i>

28:50.061 --> 28:52.291
I was driving home from work.
They were in front of Starbucks.

28:52.363 --> 28:55.526
I'm not sure if it was the day she disappeared.
It was around the same time.

28:55.600 --> 28:59.832
- Thanks.
- <i>[Child Wailing]</i>

29:01.239 --> 29:03.833
Your kid's eating sand.

29:03.908 --> 29:06.274
<i>[Wailing Continues]</i>

29:06.511 --> 29:09.105
<i>[Brennan]</i>
<i>I don't know how they can do it.</i>

29:09.180 --> 29:11.648
They're self-obsessed.
They have no conscience.

29:11.716 --> 29:13.911
- I don't know.
- They destroy anything that gets in their way.

29:13.985 --> 29:17.182
- They're not even human.
- The mothers?

29:17.255 --> 29:19.780
- Huh?
- I was talking about the mothers.

29:19.858 --> 29:22.486
- I'm talking about the killers.
- I understand killers.

29:22.560 --> 29:27.020
I just don't know how mothers can do it.
I mean, dogs can be trained in a couple weeks.

29:27.098 --> 29:29.532
With kids, mothers have
to give up their lives for years.

29:29.601 --> 29:32.593
No. When you're looking at your kid,
you don't feel like you're giving up anything.

29:32.670 --> 29:34.160
- So you'd do it again?
- What?

29:34.239 --> 29:36.537
You'd have Parker even with everything
you're going through?

29:36.608 --> 29:38.906
- What kind of question is that?
- Wouldn't it be easier...

29:38.977 --> 29:43.471
if Parker wasn't caught in this drama of yours
with Rebecca, the new boyfriend?

29:43.548 --> 29:46.039
God, no. No, Bones.
He's my son.

29:46.117 --> 29:48.745
Whatever we're going through,
it's not about that. He knows that.

29:48.820 --> 29:51.414
That's what parents say
when they want to <i>justify</i> themselves.

29:51.489 --> 29:53.957
You know, I haven't walked out on Parker.
All right?

29:54.025 --> 29:56.391
I would never have done
what your parents did.

29:56.461 --> 30:00.989
Well, I didn't say you would.
I just... I don't know.

30:01.065 --> 30:04.831
You're the father.
I don't know anything about raising kids, so...

30:04.903 --> 30:07.701
Parker's fine.

30:09.607 --> 30:11.768
- It's not Karen Tyler.
- What?

30:11.843 --> 30:14.368
The D.N.A. from under
Carlie's fingernails doesn't match.

30:14.445 --> 30:16.970
And something else is weird.

30:17.048 --> 30:21.144
- Tissue from the fetus shows
evidence of escitalopram.
- What's that?

30:21.219 --> 30:24.086
- It's a drug prescribed for depression.
- It's not weird.

30:24.155 --> 30:26.919
Carlie Richardson was having
emotional problems with her husband.

30:26.991 --> 30:28.925
Carlie Richardson
wasn't taking the drug.

30:28.993 --> 30:31.621
- Hold on. None of this is making any sense.
- I agree.

30:31.696 --> 30:34.130
The only way the fetus could
have the drug in its system...

30:34.199 --> 30:36.224
is if it were passed
from the mother in utero.

30:36.301 --> 30:39.668
- Or through breast milk.
- How do you breast-feed an unborn child?

30:39.737 --> 30:41.762
- Zack?
- Whoa.

30:41.840 --> 30:46.539
An infant's skull is made up
of several separate bones...

30:46.611 --> 30:50.069
that are eventually fused together.

30:51.115 --> 30:53.777
- Look at the molding.
- Oh, my God.

30:53.852 --> 30:56.412
- I don't believe it.
- Yeah.

30:56.487 --> 30:58.387
Okay, now everybody knows but me.

30:58.456 --> 31:00.822
This is not a fetus.

31:00.892 --> 31:05.955
The skull bones have shifted and overlapped
because this child passed through the birth canal.

31:06.030 --> 31:10.990
This baby was born alive
and lived about two weeks.

31:11.069 --> 31:13.128
But Carlie was pregnant
when she was last seen.

31:13.204 --> 31:15.695
This isn't
Carlie Richardson's child.

31:15.773 --> 31:18.867
The escitalopram in its system
came from breast milk.

31:18.943 --> 31:21.343
- Then what happened to her baby?
- [Baby Crying]

31:21.412 --> 31:25.576
<i>The baby was cut out ofher</i>
<i>and stolen.</i>

31:27.252 --> 31:29.117
This child replaced it.

31:35.126 --> 31:38.562
This child was dead
before Carlie was murdered.

31:38.630 --> 31:41.599
You can see the traces of blood
pooling in the cranium.

31:41.666 --> 31:44.863
- Abusive head trauma.
- Evidence of shaken baby syndrome.

31:44.936 --> 31:46.870
Oh, God.

31:46.938 --> 31:49.133
<i>You said the little guy</i>
<i>was only two weeks old.</i>

31:49.207 --> 31:52.665
Whoever the mother was was probably taking
the medication for postpartum depression.

31:52.744 --> 31:56.475
She got upset with the baby.
Crying's the most common cause.

31:56.547 --> 31:58.845
And she shook him to quiet him down.

31:58.917 --> 32:02.182
It can take as little as five seconds
for an infant to die by shaking.

32:02.253 --> 32:04.187
- Five seconds?
- The veins that attach the brain...

32:04.255 --> 32:07.315
to the inside of the skull detach.

32:07.392 --> 32:10.384
- <i>Blood pools, the brain swells.</i>
- <i>[Booth] Okay, I get it.</i>

32:10.461 --> 32:15.330
So what you're saying is that the mother kills
her own son and replaces him with Carlie's.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.961
Fits the pattern. She feels the guilt at
what she's done and needs to make it right...

32:19.037 --> 32:21.335
prove to herself that
she's still a good mother.

32:21.406 --> 32:24.000
So she takes Carlie's child
and makes it her own.

32:24.075 --> 32:26.635
<i>It's only been two weeks.</i>
<i>Not many people have seen her kid.</i>

32:26.711 --> 32:28.645
- <i>Who would know?</i>
- But the stab wounds.

32:28.713 --> 32:32.809
<i>All of Carlie's stab wounds are</i>
<i>to the upper part of the body.</i>

32:32.884 --> 32:36.684
<i>The killer was careful not</i>
<i>to hit close to the uterus...</i>

32:36.754 --> 32:39.245
because she wanted the baby alive.

32:39.324 --> 32:42.191
Your report indicates there were
knife marks on the lower ribs.

32:42.260 --> 32:45.252
They seem to be made by
whatever instrument was used...

32:45.330 --> 32:47.798
<i>to remove the child</i>
<i>after Carlie was dead.</i>

32:47.865 --> 32:51.562
<i>Yep. I'm working on identifying it.</i>

32:53.004 --> 32:54.995
We might be able to use
the child's...

32:55.073 --> 32:58.509
most prominent genetic characteristics
to see similarities with the mother.

32:58.576 --> 33:02.945
Ange, can you input the information
from the infant's skull to give us a face?

33:03.014 --> 33:06.040
- Sure.
- <i>[Cell Phone Ringing]</i>

33:06.117 --> 33:09.917
Booth. Yeah.
Right away.

33:09.988 --> 33:13.082
They've found Kyle Richardson.
[Clears Throat]

33:14.492 --> 33:18.087
<i>I wonder ifhe'll even care.</i>
<i>Finding out his wife is dead.</i>

33:18.162 --> 33:20.221
- He didn't kill her.
- No, but he ran.

33:20.298 --> 33:23.199
How do you just cut your family
out of your life like that?

33:23.267 --> 33:26.896
- Well, what about Abraham?
- What, you're gonna throw religion
in my face right now?

33:26.971 --> 33:28.962
I thought you found answers
in what you believe.

33:29.040 --> 33:31.235
That's just one Bible story
that I just don't like.

33:31.309 --> 33:34.767
I mean, God commands Abraham
to kill his own son, and he does.

33:34.846 --> 33:38.304
- No, Abraham does not kill Isaac.
- But old Abe, you know, he had the intention.

33:38.383 --> 33:41.181
- Well, I thought what he had was faith.
- Look, I have faith.

33:41.252 --> 33:46.087
But if God himself came down, pointed at Parker
and said, "I want you to, you know"...

33:46.157 --> 33:48.148
That ain't gonna happen.

33:48.226 --> 33:50.660
- But God's messenger stopped Abraham?
- Yeah.

33:50.728 --> 33:53.959
Grabbed his hand at the last second
right before the knife was about to go in.

33:54.032 --> 33:57.968
- Okay, then the lesson
I would learn from this myth...
- Myth?

33:58.036 --> 33:59.833
- Well, it fits the definition.
- Okay, fine.

33:59.904 --> 34:03.499
That when it comes to your children,
your love has to be absolute.

34:03.574 --> 34:06.839
The messenger represents goodness,
what you know to be right.

34:06.911 --> 34:10.938
Ergo, you have to remain open
to what you know is true.

34:11.014 --> 34:14.416
[Chuckles]
Are you sure you're not religious?

34:14.485 --> 34:17.283
- Science all the way.
- Science all the way.

34:17.355 --> 34:20.755
Hey, even an empiricist
can have a heart, Booth.

34:20.824 --> 34:23.692
Too bad Richardson doesn't.

34:25.063 --> 34:27.360
Just lock me up.
I can't go through this anymore.

34:27.431 --> 34:30.299
We know you didn't do it.

34:30.368 --> 34:33.860
- What?
- Evidence doesn't fit you.

34:35.172 --> 34:37.164
Then who was it?
Who killed them?

34:37.241 --> 34:39.232
You ran. Seems like
you'd be the one who'd know.

34:39.310 --> 34:41.244
I would've told someone if I knew.

34:41.312 --> 34:43.246
Right. 'Cause, you know,
you're such an honorable guy.

34:43.313 --> 34:45.908
The knife, the rope, the sheeting...
It all came from your place...

34:45.983 --> 34:48.315
and why didn't you tell
the police it was missing?

34:48.386 --> 34:50.717
Oh. What, you check out
what's in your garage every day?

34:50.788 --> 34:53.018
If you didn't know anything,
why did you take off?

34:53.091 --> 34:56.060
Because I'm a bastard.

34:56.127 --> 34:59.824
I'm a selfish, pathetic bastard,
and everyone had already decided that I was guilty.

34:59.897 --> 35:02.798
- That's true, Booth.
- Bones.

35:02.867 --> 35:06.200
No one wanted to find another suspect.
I kept on insisting.

35:06.270 --> 35:08.636
Thank you.

35:08.706 --> 35:10.640
But I didn't do it for you.

35:10.708 --> 35:12.869
You are a pathetic bastard.

35:12.944 --> 35:15.003
Your wife was having your baby.

35:15.079 --> 35:18.242
Look. I did wanna leave her, yeah.

35:18.316 --> 35:22.719
I was out that night trying
to figure out how to tell her...

35:22.787 --> 35:25.221
<i>what with the baby and everything.</i>

35:25.289 --> 35:28.224
<i>But for God's sake,</i>
<i>I didn't want them to die.</i>

35:28.292 --> 35:30.260
So you have no idea who did this?

35:30.328 --> 35:33.229
I should, shouldn't I?

35:35.399 --> 35:40.632
I mean, I ignored her for so long.

35:41.839 --> 35:45.240
It's like this whole thing
is my fault anyway.

35:46.611 --> 35:50.445
[Chuckles]
You know, if I had been there that night...

35:50.515 --> 35:52.847
<i>maybe they'd still be here.</i>

35:52.917 --> 35:56.444
We think your child
might still be alive.

35:58.422 --> 36:01.391
I don't understand.
The bodies you found...

36:01.459 --> 36:04.257
That wasn't your child.

36:04.328 --> 36:08.697
Whoever killed Carlie
took your child and left theirs.

36:10.334 --> 36:13.167
Oh, my God.

36:13.237 --> 36:16.365
Then... So where's my kid?

36:17.375 --> 36:19.366
We don't know.

36:21.812 --> 36:25.942
<i>Zack was working on the other knife mark.</i>
<i>I saw staining in the groove it left, so I did tests.</i>

36:26.017 --> 36:29.714
The stain was from Betadine.
It's an antiseptic used to prep patients for surgery.

36:29.787 --> 36:32.347
Oh, someone was being really careful
when they were cutting her up.

36:32.423 --> 36:34.357
It was the baby
they were concerned with.

36:34.425 --> 36:37.656
Were you able to get enough detail
from the skull for a digital reconstruction?

36:37.728 --> 36:41.289
<i>Yeah. Since someone this young</i>
<i>is still being formed...</i>

36:41.365 --> 36:45.461
the, uh, features are generalized.

36:45.536 --> 36:48.403
The last place I worked
had a drunk sketch artist.

36:49.874 --> 36:52.274
<i>Wow.</i>

36:52.343 --> 36:55.335
It's a baby.
It looks like every baby.

36:55.413 --> 36:58.109
That's why I ran the reconstruction
through an aging matrix.

36:58.182 --> 37:01.583
<i>It posits the most likely growth</i>
<i>pattern the skull would follow.</i>

37:01.652 --> 37:04.849
<i>Now as it ages, the features</i>
<i>become more distinct.</i>

37:04.922 --> 37:10.827
<i>By the time he's about 10, he shows</i>
<i>very definite genetic characteristics.</i>

37:21.005 --> 37:24.236
Robbie!
Don't eat that, honey.

37:24.308 --> 37:26.333
- [Babbling]
- There you go. There you go.

37:26.410 --> 37:29.243
<i>The mark on the ribs</i>
<i>was from a scalpel.</i>

37:29.313 --> 37:33.306
The woman is a vet, so she has medical training,
which also explains the Betadine.

37:33.384 --> 37:36.148
Look at her, playing with the kid.

37:36.220 --> 37:38.313
- It's okay. Shh.
- <i>[Booth] Ms. Corbis.</i>

37:38.389 --> 37:41.790
- I'm gonna have to ask you to hand us the child.
- What? Why?

37:41.859 --> 37:44.123
I think you know why.

37:44.195 --> 37:47.494
No. You want me
to give you my son? No.

37:47.565 --> 37:49.999
He's not your son.
We know what happened.

37:51.302 --> 37:53.293
He is. Robbie is my son.

37:53.371 --> 37:56.863
We have a warrant to take a D.N.A. sample
from you, Ms. Corbis.

37:56.941 --> 37:59.136
- <i>It'll be pretty hard to argue with that.</i>
- <i>[Robbie Fussing]</i>

37:59.210 --> 38:01.474
Shh.

38:01.545 --> 38:04.480
- <i>[Fussing Continues]</i>
- <i>Shh.</i>

38:05.916 --> 38:08.214
She didn't want him.

38:08.286 --> 38:12.245
She told me she wished she had never gotten
pregnant. It was wrong for her to have him.

38:12.323 --> 38:15.588
And killing your own child
wasn't wrong?

38:15.660 --> 38:18.060
- That was a mistake!
I am a single mother! I'm alone.
- [Crying]

38:18.129 --> 38:21.860
I just... I just wanted him to stop crying!
It was just... It was just a few seconds.

38:21.932 --> 38:24.025
<i>[Crying Continues]</i>

38:24.101 --> 38:27.229
The doctor said I was sick,
but I'm all better now.

38:27.305 --> 38:29.796
I know, sweetie.
I know, sweetie.

38:29.874 --> 38:32.934
- Ms. Corbis.
- You can't take him from me. I'm a good mother.

38:33.010 --> 38:35.376
You can ask anybody.
I'm a good mother.

38:35.446 --> 38:37.505
<i>It's okay. It's okay.</i>

38:37.581 --> 38:40.175
Give us the child.

38:41.185 --> 38:43.745
[Crying Continues]

38:45.990 --> 38:49.255
[Kisses, Sobs]

38:50.361 --> 38:53.626
- It's all right.
- It's okay.

38:53.698 --> 38:56.758
- It's okay.
- I'm a good mother.

38:56.834 --> 39:00.736
Mary Corbis, you're under arrest for
the murder and kidnapping of Carlie Richardson...

39:00.805 --> 39:02.864
<i>and the murder of your son,</i>
<i>Robert Corbis.</i>

39:02.940 --> 39:05.306
No. That's my Robbie.
That's my Robbie.

39:05.376 --> 39:09.437
<i>I'm a good mother.</i>
<i>I'm a good mother.</i>

39:09.513 --> 39:11.504
[Sobbing]
I'm a good mother.

39:15.886 --> 39:18.116
- He's fine?
- He's perfect.

39:18.189 --> 39:21.989
- [Sniffles] And you're sure?
- He's yours.

39:24.095 --> 39:28.555
When I thought he was gone,
and Carlie...

39:28.632 --> 39:32.625
<i>I wished I could've changed</i>
<i>how things had been.</i>

39:33.971 --> 39:36.098
[Babbling]

39:36.173 --> 39:38.266
<i>[Babbling Continues]</i>

39:42.580 --> 39:44.673
Don't you want to hold him?

39:46.016 --> 39:48.814
I don't know. Um...

39:48.886 --> 39:52.322
The kind of guy I am... I'm no father.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.654
You don't get to decide that.

39:55.926 --> 39:58.451
<i>You have a son.</i>

39:58.529 --> 40:02.124
Step up. Take him.

40:05.603 --> 40:07.730
Hey.

40:07.805 --> 40:11.297
[Laughs, Sighs]

40:11.375 --> 40:13.536
[Sniffles]
Thank you.

40:13.611 --> 40:15.704
<i>Thank you.</i>

40:15.780 --> 40:17.771
<i>[Sniffles]</i>
<i>Mmm.</i>

40:17.848 --> 40:19.782
Hey.

40:19.850 --> 40:24.116
Oh. Mmm.

40:24.188 --> 40:26.122
[Chuckles]

40:27.525 --> 40:30.653
<i>So you think Richardson</i>
<i>can rise to the occasion?</i>

40:30.728 --> 40:34.357
- Be a decent father?
- Well, he's got Carlie's parents to help him, and...

40:34.432 --> 40:36.423
and I like to think
that people can change.

40:36.500 --> 40:38.900
- Faith and hope, right?
- Right.

40:38.969 --> 40:42.461
- Angela threw in love too.
- Love is good.

40:42.540 --> 40:45.805
- Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!
- <i>[Booth] Parker!</i>

40:45.876 --> 40:49.209
- Look what I did.
- Wow! Look at that!

40:50.481 --> 40:54.144
<i>Um, listen, you stay here</i>
<i>with Dr. Brennan, okay?</i>

40:54.218 --> 40:56.482
I'm gonna go talk to
your mommy, all right?

40:56.554 --> 40:58.545
[Kisses]
All right?

40:58.622 --> 41:02.023
Listen, uh, this is how
it's gotta go down?

41:02.092 --> 41:04.253
I gotta meet your boyfriend
with Parker here?

41:04.328 --> 41:07.695
- Look, man, we're here because we wanna...
- I'm talking to Rebecca.

41:08.966 --> 41:11.526
Look, this was...
This was Drew's idea.

41:11.602 --> 41:14.196
And I told him that
it was gonna be a bad one.

41:14.271 --> 41:15.863
- Dad, look!
- One second, bud.

41:15.940 --> 41:18.204
- Booth?
- Parker wanted you to see
what he made for school.

41:18.275 --> 41:22.177
And he kept saying how much
he wanted us to meet, that we'd be friends.

41:25.015 --> 41:28.178
<i>Look, I got a kid I don't</i>
<i>get to see much myself.</i>

41:28.252 --> 41:31.119
<i>I know what it's like.</i>

41:31.188 --> 41:34.646
And I swear the...
the explosives were for work.

41:34.725 --> 41:37.125
Booth?

41:37.194 --> 41:40.857
Okay, look, look, look, look, look.
We are what we are.

41:40.931 --> 41:45.197
And-And you can fight it if you want,
but you're just gonna fight with yourself.

41:45.269 --> 41:49.865
<i>Maybe this isn't a good time.</i>
<i>Maybe later.</i>

41:52.042 --> 41:54.636
No. No, it's... it's a good time.

41:54.712 --> 41:57.909
Let me buy you a cup of coffee, all right?

41:57.982 --> 42:00.212
<i>Nah, it's cool.</i>
<i>Have a seat.</i>

42:00.284 --> 42:02.479
- Seriously?
- Thanks, man.

42:03.320 --> 42:05.254
It's okay, Bones. Stay.

42:05.322 --> 42:08.553
[Clears Throat]
It's a family thing. Bye, Parker.

42:08.626 --> 42:10.787
- <i>[Parker] Bye.</i>
- Bye.

42:10.861 --> 42:14.888
- All right, what do we got here? Huh?
- A di... A diorama.

42:14.965 --> 42:17.229
- <i>[Booth] Whoa!</i>
- <i>[Parker] It's the zoo. Drew helped me.</i>

42:17.301 --> 42:19.428
- The zoo? I hope you thanked him, huh?
- Yeah.

42:19.503 --> 42:21.937
- <i>You did, huh?</i>
- We got to go to the zoo.

42:22.006 --> 42:24.031
He knows <i>all</i> the animals.

42:24.108 --> 42:26.303
All the animals? Wow.

42:26.377 --> 42:31.337
<i>Okay, well, maybe afterwards we could, uh,</i>
<i>all go out to dinner, if it's okay with your mom.</i>

42:33.117 --> 42:35.950
Yeah. That... That sounds good.

42:36.020 --> 42:39.615
- My dad knows a burgers place.
- <i>Yeah. I used to take him there after his T-ball.</i>

42:39.690 --> 42:41.658
<i>So go ahead.</i>
<i>Tell Drew about the burger.</i>

42:41.725 --> 42:43.716
He says they're as big as my head.

42:43.794 --> 42:46.695
Yeah, big as your head. We can all go.
We could even bring "Stu".

42:46.764 --> 42:49.756
[Chattering]

43:27.538 --> 43:28.903
What's that mean?
