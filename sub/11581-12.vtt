NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.204 --> 00:05.439
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:05.473 --> 00:07.708
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:07.741 --> 00:09.577
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:09.610 --> 00:11.179
are members of an elite squad

00:11.212 --> 00:13.047
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.081 --> 00:18.052
These are their stories.

00:18.086 --> 00:19.587
I don't care how much
money I'll make.

00:19.620 --> 00:20.454
I'm going to med school.

00:20.488 --> 00:22.190
You're not going
to make the big bucks

00:22.223 --> 00:24.458
working at an HMO,
and those loans...

00:24.492 --> 00:26.194
Why do we have
to be rich?

00:26.227 --> 00:27.728
I want my life
to be meaningful.

00:27.761 --> 00:30.064
Oh, so suddenly having money
isn't be meaningful?

00:30.098 --> 00:34.068
I love you, but
your values suck.

00:34.102 --> 00:36.504
( woman shrieking )
Oh, my God...

00:38.239 --> 00:39.673
Kyle!

00:41.375 --> 00:42.743
Kyle, be careful!

00:46.380 --> 00:48.216
Kyle!

00:48.249 --> 00:49.617
BAMFORD:
Folks over there say

00:49.650 --> 00:51.752
she came running
down the street already on fire.

00:51.785 --> 00:53.221
And you're thinking
it's a rape.

00:53.254 --> 00:54.622
That's why I called
the panty police.

00:54.655 --> 00:56.490
Found her torn underwear
in that doorway.

00:56.524 --> 00:58.759
Guy must've ripped 'em off
before he torched her.

00:58.792 --> 01:00.228
She's pretty crispy.

01:00.261 --> 01:01.762
Any prayer of
getting DNA?

01:01.795 --> 01:04.665
Only if you have a special
connection upstairs.

01:04.698 --> 01:07.635
With any luck, the lab'll find
something on the underwear.

01:07.668 --> 01:08.769
The guy was careless.

01:08.802 --> 01:10.504
Maybe he left
something else behind.

01:10.538 --> 01:12.373
Looks like there's blood
on that pipe.

01:12.406 --> 01:14.375
He could've hit her
on the head with it.

01:14.408 --> 01:16.110
STABLER:
Smells like fuel oil.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.246
You'd have to add an accelerant
to light her up.

01:18.279 --> 01:20.381
We'll run a gas chromo,
see what he used.

01:20.414 --> 01:23.517
BENSON:
Well, there's no
mailing labels on
these magazines,

01:23.551 --> 01:26.387
but we got a register receipt.

01:26.420 --> 01:28.522
Time stamp says 7:14.

01:28.556 --> 01:31.525
Witnesses said they saw her
around 7:40,

01:31.559 --> 01:33.794
so maybe she bought
the magazines nearby.

01:33.827 --> 01:35.796
We find the newsstand.
Or better yet,
get prints.

01:35.829 --> 01:37.398
Any I.D.? Purse?

01:37.431 --> 01:40.134
Fire melted it
onto her body.

01:40.168 --> 01:43.137
I've never seen
a woman raped and
then burned alive.

01:43.171 --> 01:45.706
Guy's looking
to send a message.

01:47.208 --> 01:51.412
Captioning sponsored by
UNIVERSAL NETWORK TELEVISION

01:51.445 --> 01:54.215
and NBC

02:32.753 --> 02:33.721
Whoever you're looking for

02:33.754 --> 02:34.622
is sicker than I thought.

02:34.655 --> 02:36.290
Setting her on fire
isn't sick enough?

02:36.324 --> 02:37.425
Not for this guy.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.826
There are pubic hairs
in that blood.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.428
He raped her
with a pipe.

02:40.461 --> 02:42.963
To be sure, I stained
the skin cells

02:42.996 --> 02:45.299
scraped off the metal;
they're cervical.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.467
VICAP should be able
to tell us

02:46.500 --> 02:48.702
if there're any rapists out
there who uses foreign objects

02:48.736 --> 02:49.503
and burns their victim.

02:49.537 --> 02:51.572
He didn't burn
quite all of her.

02:51.605 --> 02:52.840
She was wearing
high boots.

02:52.873 --> 02:55.309
You see that? It's
made from henna.

02:55.343 --> 02:56.109
STABLER:
Some tattoo.

02:56.143 --> 02:58.312
Drawn on the skin
and set with oil.

02:58.346 --> 03:00.448
It's a traditional
Muslim design

03:00.481 --> 03:02.316
for weddings and
family celebrations.

03:02.350 --> 03:03.851
Only Muslim?
Mostly.

03:03.884 --> 03:07.488
You see it in Africa, India
and all over the Middle East.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.591
Burning Muslims?
Could be a hate crime.

03:10.624 --> 03:11.725
Let's not say that
too loud.

03:11.759 --> 03:13.461
Last thing we need
is copycats.

03:13.494 --> 03:14.395
STABLER:
Nothing from VICAP.

03:14.428 --> 03:15.996
The only burnings
of women we could find

03:16.029 --> 03:17.465
are by men in India
when their wives

03:17.498 --> 03:18.466
don't play by the rules.

03:18.499 --> 03:19.600
Yeah, like
having an affair.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.001
Husband's family
helps do the burning.

03:21.034 --> 03:22.336
An angry husband
makes sense,

03:22.370 --> 03:23.737
especially if his
wife cheated on him.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.339
CRAGEN:
That would cover a lot of men.

03:25.373 --> 03:26.607
He burned her alive.

03:26.640 --> 03:27.741
What does that tell you?

03:27.775 --> 03:29.610
Fire's a form
of purification.

03:29.643 --> 03:31.612
We burn witches,
garbage,

03:31.645 --> 03:33.881
anything that makes us
feel evil or dirty...

03:33.914 --> 03:36.350
and, of course, fire's
a metaphor for passion.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.486
Freud believed
that setting fires

03:38.519 --> 03:39.553
was a sign
of disturbed

03:39.587 --> 03:40.821
adolescent sexuality.

03:40.854 --> 03:44.525
Maybe we're dealing with a man
who still lives with his mother.

03:44.558 --> 03:45.526
MUNCH:
We found the guy

03:45.559 --> 03:46.427
who sold her
the magazines.

03:46.460 --> 03:48.362
Doesn't remember
what she looked like,

03:48.396 --> 03:50.364
what she said,
or if she was with anyone,

03:50.398 --> 03:51.932
and considering
what he was snorting,

03:51.965 --> 03:53.634
it's a miracle
he remembers his own name.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.636
CRAGEN:
Whatever this is,
let's be careful
not to say

03:55.669 --> 03:57.771
Muslim men like
to burn their wives.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.039
No, if they want
to burn people,

03:59.072 --> 04:00.908
they fly a airplane
full of gasoline

04:00.941 --> 04:03.377
into an office building.
Excuse me,

04:03.411 --> 04:05.479
but they were extremists.
( phone rings )

04:05.513 --> 04:07.381
Sorry, but my next door
neighbor's Iranian.

04:07.415 --> 04:08.649
At airports,
even he's scared

04:08.682 --> 04:10.050
when he sees
Middle Eastern passports.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.385
I mean, let's get real.

04:11.419 --> 04:12.920
People know it's wrong,
but they think it

04:12.953 --> 04:15.523
anyway.
STABLER:
Okay, thanks.

04:15.556 --> 04:16.657
Lab caught us a break.

04:16.690 --> 04:18.892
CRAGEN:
Talk to them.

04:18.926 --> 04:21.061
The prints on the magazines
are smudged,

04:21.094 --> 04:22.530
basically useless.

04:22.563 --> 04:23.731
Is that the good news?

04:23.764 --> 04:27.935
Be patient. Her
purse burned with
everything inside.

04:27.968 --> 04:29.937
We tested the
ash residue.

04:29.970 --> 04:33.807
It was made of suede,
and we were able to
clean up the label.

04:33.841 --> 04:35.409
STABLER:
"Lant-ve-lyn"?

04:35.443 --> 04:36.677
BENSON:
Probably a private label.

04:36.710 --> 04:38.412
That's what
I was thinking.

04:38.446 --> 04:40.414
Okay, I give up.
Private label?

04:40.448 --> 04:42.082
Well, small stores
go to manufacturers

04:42.115 --> 04:43.817
who provide them
with custom labels

04:43.851 --> 04:46.687
to make it look like the purse
was made only for that store.

04:46.720 --> 04:51.659
Now, I'm guessing
that the "lyn"... is Brooklyn.

04:51.692 --> 04:54.462
Indian or Middle Eastern
neighborhoods in Brooklyn.

04:56.029 --> 04:59.833
Atlantic Avenue?

05:02.470 --> 05:06.374
Let's see if somebody there
recognizes the tattoo.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.709
It's beautiful, but
it's not my work,

05:08.742 --> 05:10.444
and this wasn't done
by an Indian.

05:10.478 --> 05:11.979
Do you have any idea
who might've done it?

05:12.012 --> 05:13.981
Someone from Egypt,
I would think.

05:14.014 --> 05:16.984
See the narrow penpoint style,
the detailing?

05:17.017 --> 05:20.454
Zara? Hey, Zara.

05:20.488 --> 05:21.722
Zara, come look.

05:21.755 --> 05:23.591
Is this your work?

05:23.624 --> 05:25.125
They're police officers.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.727
Of course,
I did that.

05:26.760 --> 05:28.662
Aha, I thought so.
It's lovely.

05:28.696 --> 05:30.664
Do you remember
who you did it for?

05:30.698 --> 05:33.000
Mira Elbisi.
She was attending a celebration:

05:33.033 --> 05:34.535
a birth of a friend's baby.

05:34.568 --> 05:37.004
You know Mira well?
Mira's just
a customer.

05:37.037 --> 05:40.140
I like her. Her name in Arabic
means "princess,"

05:40.173 --> 05:42.376
like mine: Zara,
from the Hebrew.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.611
STABLER:
You Jewish?

05:43.644 --> 05:45.613
Oh, no, no. She's Muslim.

05:45.646 --> 05:48.882
ZARA:
The languages-- Arabic,
Hebrew dialects--

05:48.916 --> 05:50.017
they blend together.

05:50.050 --> 05:51.619
What's this all about?

05:51.652 --> 05:53.754
Do you know where
Mira's family lives?

05:53.787 --> 05:56.356
May I see your identification?

06:00.093 --> 06:03.897
Mira's husband
and his mother, Jazlyn--

06:03.931 --> 06:06.634
they publish The Arab-American,
the newspaper.

06:06.667 --> 06:09.069
It's around the corner
near the mosque.

06:10.438 --> 06:13.040
My wife? Haven't seen her
since last evening.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.041
She's with a friend.

06:14.074 --> 06:15.509
Which friend
would that be?

06:15.543 --> 06:17.044
Uh, my wife has
many friends.

06:17.077 --> 06:18.912
Are you two
not getting along?

06:18.946 --> 06:20.514
Of course we are.

06:20.548 --> 06:22.483
Mr. Elbisi,
is this your wife?

06:23.517 --> 06:24.652
Not to be rude, but it seems

06:24.685 --> 06:25.819
that if everything was fine,

06:25.853 --> 06:28.121
you'd know where
she spent the night.
Well, I tell you,

06:28.155 --> 06:30.157
you know what I find strange:
We ask you about your wife.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.059
You're not the least bit curious
why we're asking.

06:32.092 --> 06:33.527
Did she file a
new complaint,

06:33.561 --> 06:35.896
how I mistreat
and harass her?

06:35.929 --> 06:37.598
Why? You like to beat her up?

06:37.631 --> 06:39.600
I would never hurt Mira.
Where were you
last night?

06:39.633 --> 06:41.802
My mother and I worked
here late putting
the paper to bed.

06:41.835 --> 06:44.204
My mother's Jazlyn
Elbisi-- she's well-
known in the community.

06:44.237 --> 06:45.806
She here today?

06:45.839 --> 06:47.808
She took the day off.

06:47.841 --> 06:49.076
And how late did you two work?

06:49.109 --> 06:50.210
Mira doesn't
like being alone

06:50.243 --> 06:51.378
in the apartment
after dark.

06:51.411 --> 06:54.081
Sometimes she visits
friends in Bay Ridge
and stays over.

06:54.114 --> 06:55.115
Which friends?

06:56.850 --> 06:59.086
I-I don't know.

06:59.119 --> 07:01.221
Recognize this tattoo?

07:01.254 --> 07:04.992
Yes... and that mole.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.228
It's Mira.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.964
Why do you have
that photograph?

07:10.998 --> 07:14.234
Mr. Elbisi,
we're very sorry.

07:14.267 --> 07:16.570
Your wife was murdered
last night.

07:18.606 --> 07:19.707
No...

07:19.740 --> 07:21.709
STABLER:
She was burned to death.

07:21.742 --> 07:23.711
Who could've done this?

07:23.744 --> 07:26.580
We're hoping
you can help us with that.

07:26.614 --> 07:30.017
I wouldn't have any idea.

07:34.154 --> 07:37.124
JAZLYN:
Of course I was at the paper
with my son

07:37.157 --> 07:38.125
all evening.

07:38.158 --> 07:39.259
Could you translate
"evening"

07:39.292 --> 07:40.861
into something
more specific?

07:40.894 --> 07:43.597
I went to the office
around 5:00.

07:43.631 --> 07:44.798
I left at midnight.

07:44.832 --> 07:48.869
Your son told two detectives
that you left at, uh, 10:00 p.m.

07:48.902 --> 07:50.738
10:00, midnight.
It was a long day.

07:50.771 --> 07:51.972
What's the difference?

07:52.005 --> 07:54.141
The difference is
your stories don't match.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.876
Which probably means
you're not telling the truth.

07:55.909 --> 07:59.613
You just want to make Arabs
look like bad people.

07:59.647 --> 08:02.149
That's why you're here.

08:02.182 --> 08:03.884
All right.

08:03.917 --> 08:07.888
I came home with my grandson.

08:07.921 --> 08:09.890
I took him to the office,

08:09.923 --> 08:12.292
and I brought him home
to put him to bed.

08:12.325 --> 08:13.627
MUNCH:
Where was
his mother?

08:13.661 --> 08:14.895
I don't know.

08:14.928 --> 08:16.029
Nanna,

08:16.063 --> 08:17.765
where's Mama?

08:17.798 --> 08:20.534
When's Mama coming home?

08:24.905 --> 08:26.907
Sonny boy must've called Mom
and warned her.

08:26.940 --> 08:28.776
And they couldn't keep
their stories straight.

08:28.809 --> 08:30.310
Every word out of
her mouth was a lie,

08:30.343 --> 08:31.645
except maybe
"Good morning."

08:31.679 --> 08:32.913
Casey?

08:32.946 --> 08:35.616
Who talked to a reporter
about this burned woman?

08:35.649 --> 08:37.050
And it's nice to see you, too.

08:37.084 --> 08:39.620
"Burn Victim Said
To Be Target Of Hate Crime.

08:39.653 --> 08:41.655
"Sources say Special
Victims Unit detectives

08:41.689 --> 08:43.256
"refuse to release the
woman's ethnicity

08:43.290 --> 08:45.926
for fear of setting off
more attacks."

08:45.959 --> 08:47.861
I hope this didn't come
from here.

08:47.895 --> 08:49.196
We don't leak
to the press.

08:49.229 --> 08:51.665
Only person I talked
to about this was you.

08:51.699 --> 08:53.066
Well, then, how did
they get the story?

08:53.100 --> 08:54.201
Somebody heard
the rumor,

08:54.234 --> 08:56.169
made up the rest.
When this hits

08:56.203 --> 08:59.206
the papers before I brief
my boss, I look incompetent.

08:59.239 --> 09:02.676
Three weeks ago,
Mira Elbisi called the 7-4,

09:02.710 --> 09:04.077
said she was afraid
of her husband.

09:04.111 --> 09:06.079
Cops respond. She apologizes.

09:06.113 --> 09:07.347
She overreacted.

09:07.380 --> 09:09.216
One week later,
neighbor calls.

09:09.249 --> 09:10.483
Shouting from the Elbisi
apartment.

09:10.517 --> 09:12.820
This time, it was the mother-
in-law who sent the cops away.

09:12.853 --> 09:14.221
If he was abusing her,

09:14.254 --> 09:16.223
Mira had a lot of courage
calling the cops.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.357
Well, let's find this neighbor

09:17.390 --> 09:19.359
and see what the shouting
was about.

09:19.392 --> 09:20.961
I think maybe he hit her.

09:20.994 --> 09:22.362
She had a split lip
the next day.

09:22.395 --> 09:23.296
What were they
fighting about?

09:23.330 --> 09:25.098
I don't know.
Mira said she cut herself.

09:25.132 --> 09:25.899
I didn't believe her.

09:25.933 --> 09:26.967
Must have had a reason
for that.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.369
Well, she was struggling,
you know-- it was obvious.

09:29.402 --> 09:30.971
She had no one to talk to.

09:31.004 --> 09:32.706
She told me
she was true to Islam,

09:32.740 --> 09:34.842
but you could see
this lady wanted some freedom.

09:34.875 --> 09:36.243
STABLER:
You ever talk
to her husband?

09:36.276 --> 09:38.712
I don't go where I'm not wanted.

09:38.746 --> 09:40.113
Got a problem
with Arabs?

09:40.147 --> 09:43.717
No. He's got a problem with me.

09:43.751 --> 09:45.118
He's an educated guy.

09:45.152 --> 09:47.120
I think he looks down
on tradespeople.

09:47.154 --> 09:48.989
Did Mira fight with
her mother-in-law?

09:49.022 --> 09:50.991
She hated living
with the old lady.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.392
She felt squeezed.

09:52.425 --> 09:55.128
When they shouted,
they turned up the stereo.

09:55.162 --> 09:57.397
She ever mention anybody
that she confided in?

09:57.430 --> 09:59.266
There was one friend:
a guy who works

09:59.299 --> 10:01.268
for some do-gooder
religious group.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.136
He-he's Jewish.
She wanted me to meet him.

10:03.170 --> 10:06.006
Name's, uh, Feldman,
Joshua Feldman.

10:06.039 --> 10:08.909
She thought since I'm Jewish,
I'd make a donation.

10:11.178 --> 10:13.013
He beat her up, didn't he?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.147
That lunatic husband of hers.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.015
Is that why you're here?

10:15.048 --> 10:17.885
Mr. Feldman,
did you see Mira last night?

10:17.918 --> 10:19.753
Is she in the hospital?
Tell me.

10:19.787 --> 10:22.289
STABLER:
Was she here last night?
I was expecting her.

10:22.322 --> 10:24.758
We're trying to build
bridges here between
Muslims and Jews,

10:24.792 --> 10:26.293
and she wanted to
be a part of it.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.295
When she didn't
show up, I called.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.297
Her-her mother-in-law
answered, and I hung up.

10:30.330 --> 10:33.033
Why didn't you leave
a message?
Strange man calling

10:33.066 --> 10:35.736
a married Muslim woman
might not go over too well.

10:35.769 --> 10:37.037
So she kept her work here
secret?

10:37.070 --> 10:38.706
Yes.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.440
Mira's afraid her husband'll
keep her from coming.

10:40.473 --> 10:43.043
Please... tell me,
is she all right?

10:43.076 --> 10:45.178
Mr. Feldman...

10:45.212 --> 10:48.916
last night, Mira was attacked
two blocks from here.

10:48.949 --> 10:51.051
Maybe you read
today's paper?

10:51.084 --> 10:53.086
No...

10:55.088 --> 10:58.058
That was Mira?

10:58.091 --> 11:00.828
Oh, God, no...

11:01.829 --> 11:05.098
So, you two
were more than friends.

11:07.367 --> 11:10.037
We were in love.

11:10.070 --> 11:11.204
She was going to leave him.

11:11.238 --> 11:13.340
We were going to live together.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.743
Did her husband know
about all this?

11:15.776 --> 11:18.345
Yes. When she told him
I was Jewish,

11:18.378 --> 11:20.347
he said he'd never let her go,

11:20.380 --> 11:22.415
never let her leave.

11:31.358 --> 11:32.826
Mira and I fought.

11:32.860 --> 11:33.626
We argued.

11:33.660 --> 11:35.929
We're from
different generations.

11:35.963 --> 11:37.798
We didn't get along--
this was no secret.

11:37.831 --> 11:40.233
You sure had some secrets
last time we talked.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.202
Like where
your daughter-in-law was

11:42.235 --> 11:43.804
when you were
baby-sitting.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.138
I don't know.

11:45.172 --> 11:47.074
Your wife is out

11:47.107 --> 11:48.475
at night,
you have a young child,

11:48.508 --> 11:50.143
and you don't know where she is?

11:50.177 --> 11:51.812
She didn't
always tell me.

11:51.845 --> 11:52.980
I wonder why.

11:53.013 --> 11:54.381
I don't know
what you mean.

11:54.414 --> 11:56.349
I mean
her boyfriend.

11:56.383 --> 11:58.819
Please. My wife is dead.

11:58.852 --> 12:01.321
Don't defame her good name.

12:01.354 --> 12:05.158
Did you leave the newspaper
office at around 6:00

12:05.192 --> 12:07.060
with a can of fuel oil?

12:07.094 --> 12:09.329
We got a warrant,

12:09.362 --> 12:12.065
and we searched your car.

12:12.099 --> 12:15.335
Our lab found traces of oil
in your trunk.

12:15.368 --> 12:17.204
You want
to explain that?

12:18.205 --> 12:20.207
Our boiler in the office
went out.

12:20.240 --> 12:21.842
You need oil to prime it,

12:21.875 --> 12:24.244
and the service company
wouldn't come out,

12:24.277 --> 12:26.246
so we had to get some ourselves.

12:26.279 --> 12:28.181
We figure you
left your grandson

12:28.215 --> 12:31.251
at the office, and went out
with your son to start a fire.

12:31.284 --> 12:33.353
We're not barbarians.

12:33.386 --> 12:35.956
We are faithful Muslims.

12:35.989 --> 12:37.891
And you couldn't bear
that your daughter-in-law

12:37.925 --> 12:38.926
was in love with a Jew.

12:38.959 --> 12:41.094
AL-SHANI:
She cheated on me.

12:41.128 --> 12:47.334
She disgraced our family...
but I still loved her.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.870
Your wife wanted a divorce,
and you refused.

12:49.903 --> 12:51.471
Mira wanted to go,
she could go.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.373
Not if you threatened
to kill her.

12:53.406 --> 12:55.142
I would never do that.
Yeah, you would.

12:55.175 --> 12:56.844
The neighbor said
that you split her lip.

12:56.877 --> 12:57.845
It was an accident.

12:57.878 --> 12:58.846
We were both ill-tempered.

12:58.879 --> 12:59.947
That's not
what her boyfriend said.

12:59.980 --> 13:03.283
You see, Mr. Elbisi,
I want to believe you, I do...

13:03.316 --> 13:05.285
but you find out that your wife

13:05.318 --> 13:07.554
is having an affair
with a Jewish man,

13:07.587 --> 13:10.790
and I'm wondering how
somebody like you would react.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.929
Someone like me?

13:15.963 --> 13:18.531
He puts his head down.

13:18.565 --> 13:20.233
He cries.

13:20.267 --> 13:24.504
He mourns the loss of his son
because his wife gets custody.

13:24.537 --> 13:27.574
He doesn't set
the woman he loves on fire.

13:27.607 --> 13:30.443
Circumstantial-- unless
you get permission
to talk to his kid.

13:30.477 --> 13:32.579
A six-year-old
whose mother was just murdered?

13:32.612 --> 13:35.315
No judge will let us near him
unless we indict the father.

13:35.348 --> 13:36.616
Sure we got the
right people?

13:36.649 --> 13:37.918
Yeah. Why?

13:37.951 --> 13:39.186
Then we got a copycat.

13:39.219 --> 13:40.187
NOVAK:
What?

13:40.220 --> 13:41.454
94th Street and Second Avenue,

13:41.488 --> 13:42.455
near the big mosque.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.456
A man set on fire.

13:43.490 --> 13:45.292
Name was Tariq
Assad, 27.

13:45.325 --> 13:47.027
Didn't live
to make it to
the ambulance,

13:47.060 --> 13:49.129
but we got a witness.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.597
BENSON:
The witness is
Jason Mullavy.

13:50.630 --> 13:52.432
Says the guy in flames
came toward him,

13:52.465 --> 13:53.533
and he heard
somebody shouting,

13:53.566 --> 13:56.269
"Killer, you'll
burn in hell for
what you did to us!"

13:56.303 --> 13:58.638
Just what the city needs
to read in tomorrow's papers.

13:58.671 --> 13:59.907
Mr. Mullavy?

13:59.940 --> 14:01.274
Jason,
Captain Cragen.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.575
How you doing?

14:02.609 --> 14:03.944
Look, we'd like you

14:03.977 --> 14:05.445
not to repeat what you saw
to the press.

14:05.478 --> 14:06.613
You think
you can handle that?

14:06.646 --> 14:07.414
I guess, yeah,

14:07.447 --> 14:09.249
but I could get
real money for this.

14:09.282 --> 14:11.218
Well, that could compromise
our investigation.

14:11.251 --> 14:13.620
I think maybe The Enquirer
would pay me for an interview.

14:13.653 --> 14:15.455
You could turn them down.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.657
That depends
how much they offer.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.359
Detective Munch.
Yes, sir?

14:19.392 --> 14:20.593
Take this young man
into custody

14:20.627 --> 14:21.594
as a material witness.

14:21.628 --> 14:22.529
Lock him up

14:22.562 --> 14:24.631
somewhere comfortable.
I know just the place.

14:24.664 --> 14:27.300
You can't do this to me.
He just did.

14:27.334 --> 14:28.401
BENSON:
Same M.O.

14:28.435 --> 14:30.070
Torn underwear
on the ground,

14:30.103 --> 14:31.438
and the smell of fuel oil.

14:31.471 --> 14:33.373
We didn't release
anything about fuel oil.

14:33.406 --> 14:34.975
This is definitely
not a copycat.

14:35.008 --> 14:36.609
We got a pipe with
blood and tissue,

14:36.643 --> 14:38.145
like the first victim.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.948
WARNER:
Only the last one
had cervical cells.

14:40.981 --> 14:42.149
With a male victim,

14:42.182 --> 14:44.517
I'm betting
this one will be rectal.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.585
We got to figure out

14:45.618 --> 14:47.387
how this guy
picks his victims,

14:47.420 --> 14:48.688
and we got to
do it fast.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.090
There's one distinction

14:50.123 --> 14:51.224
he's not making.

14:51.258 --> 14:52.659
The first one's a female, 29.

14:52.692 --> 14:54.327
The second victim's a male, 27.

14:54.361 --> 14:56.063
STABLER:
They both look
Middle Eastern.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.498
Other than that, so far,
they got nothing else in common.

14:58.531 --> 14:59.499
Except that he

14:59.532 --> 15:01.634
symbolically raped them
and set them on fire.

15:01.668 --> 15:04.137
CRAGEN:
A crime of opportunity,
or does he stalk them?

15:04.171 --> 15:06.006
It's hard to say,
but he seems impulsive.

15:06.039 --> 15:07.140
He brings a pipe with him.

15:07.174 --> 15:08.241
That's premeditation.

15:08.275 --> 15:09.276
Any leads off the pipes?

15:09.309 --> 15:11.478
FIN:
Old, corroded junk,
different manufacturers.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.213
He could have picked it up
off the street.

15:13.246 --> 15:14.414
Using a pipe as a penis,

15:14.447 --> 15:17.550
so he's just your garden-variety
sexually repressed racist.

15:17.584 --> 15:18.551
Actually, I think

15:18.585 --> 15:21.188
the racism is a cover,
a mask for inadequacies.

15:21.221 --> 15:23.690
He probably has conscious
feelings of being wronged,

15:23.723 --> 15:25.158
cheated by life.

15:25.192 --> 15:27.294
And using a pipe
on both sexes...?

15:27.327 --> 15:28.428
HUANG:
A need to humiliate.

15:28.461 --> 15:30.130
These offenders were
often humiliated

15:30.163 --> 15:31.531
or abused as children.

15:31.564 --> 15:33.600
So, you're saying
race isn't what sets him off.

15:33.633 --> 15:35.135
In a way, yes.

15:35.168 --> 15:37.370
He sees these features
that are Middle Eastern.

15:37.404 --> 15:38.571
That person is "the other."

15:38.605 --> 15:41.541
This killer needs someone
different from himself to hate.

15:41.574 --> 15:43.443
He sees an Arab,
he thinks terrorist.

15:43.476 --> 15:44.744
Well, he's not alone.

15:44.777 --> 15:46.313
Even normal
people have

15:46.346 --> 15:48.081
crazy thoughts,
but we don't act on them.

15:48.115 --> 15:49.616
The new victim,
Tariq Assad--

15:49.649 --> 15:52.119
I found his brother.

15:54.154 --> 15:56.456
We came here
to study engineering.

15:56.489 --> 15:58.325
Our parents live in Cairo.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.460
We're trying to trace
your brother's movements.

16:00.493 --> 16:01.728
Can you help us with that?

16:01.761 --> 16:05.565
As far as I know,
he would have been
in class till noon.

16:05.598 --> 16:07.300
Then he'd go
to the mosque

16:07.334 --> 16:09.036
for religious
instruction.

16:09.069 --> 16:11.671
He was a much more
observant Muslim than I.

16:11.704 --> 16:15.108
Did he socialize in the Arab
community in Brooklyn?

16:15.142 --> 16:16.209
You mean
the woman

16:16.243 --> 16:18.078
who was killed?

16:18.111 --> 16:20.213
No, he wouldn't know her.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.748
You seem pretty sure of that.

16:21.781 --> 16:23.016
My brother and I...

16:23.050 --> 16:25.218
Well, that's not
our sort of people.

16:25.252 --> 16:28.388
You know, they're still
very isolated in Brooklyn.

16:28.421 --> 16:29.656
Tariq was quite social.

16:29.689 --> 16:34.094
He spent a lot of time teaching
Christians and Jews about Islam.

16:34.127 --> 16:36.163
He called it "building bridges."

16:36.196 --> 16:37.764
STABLER:
"Building bridges"?

16:37.797 --> 16:39.632
Did he use
that specific phrase--

16:39.666 --> 16:41.234
building bridges?

16:41.268 --> 16:42.569
Yes.

16:42.602 --> 16:45.472
He was a bit of an idealist.

16:45.505 --> 16:47.574
Is that important?

16:47.607 --> 16:49.776
Do you know if he belonged
to any organizations?

16:49.809 --> 16:51.244
A place downtown--

16:51.278 --> 16:53.413
The Interfaith Council.

16:53.446 --> 16:56.549
FELDMAN:
Now, it's Tariq Assad?

16:56.583 --> 16:58.118
Don't tell me
Mira's crazy husband

16:58.151 --> 16:59.386
is killing people she met here.

16:59.419 --> 17:01.054
STABLER:
We don't think
he's involved.

17:01.088 --> 17:02.789
So, you knew Tariq?

17:02.822 --> 17:05.092
This is a nightmare.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.693
Kid was such an optimist.

17:06.726 --> 17:10.763
I mean, how many Arabs tell you
Israel is a great country?

17:10.797 --> 17:12.365
Could Tariq have known Mira?

17:12.399 --> 17:14.334
Mira and Tariq
were on the same panel

17:14.367 --> 17:16.336
last week--
"The Modernization of Islam."

17:16.369 --> 17:18.271
STABLER:
You sell tickets
to that event?

17:18.305 --> 17:19.472
No. People just show up.

17:19.506 --> 17:21.141
It's open
to the public.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.543
How about that thing up there?

17:23.576 --> 17:25.378
Security
we have plenty of.

17:25.412 --> 17:27.547
Metal detectors,
cameras, guards.

17:27.580 --> 17:30.117
We record everything
just in case.

17:34.121 --> 17:36.723
This is the tape
after the panel.

17:36.756 --> 17:38.691
Camera three is the reception.

17:38.725 --> 17:40.260
BENSON:
There's Tariq Assad.

17:40.293 --> 17:42.729
FELDMAN:
And there's Mira in the front.

17:42.762 --> 17:44.864
That guy in the baseball cap--
he was standing

17:44.897 --> 17:47.100
next to Tariq; now, watch.

17:48.768 --> 17:50.103
Sidling up next to Mira.

17:50.137 --> 17:51.204
Do you know him?

17:51.238 --> 17:52.572
No, never
seen him before.

17:52.605 --> 17:53.706
What's
on his jacket?

17:53.740 --> 17:55.242
Can you freeze that for me?

17:57.210 --> 17:59.246
Can you bring
it in closer?

18:01.514 --> 18:03.216
BENSON:
"Donaghue Heating Service."

18:03.250 --> 18:05.185
STABLER:
Heating.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.220
As in fuel oil.

18:08.388 --> 18:09.756
DONAGHUE:
Yeah, it's
Sean Webster.

18:09.789 --> 18:10.757
Drives a
truck for us.

18:10.790 --> 18:12.292
Is he in
some kind of trouble?

18:12.325 --> 18:13.560
We just want
to talk to him.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.328
He's clocking in;
top of his shift.

18:15.362 --> 18:16.496
Hey, Sean!

18:16.529 --> 18:19.566
Some cops here want
to talk to you.

18:19.599 --> 18:21.268
Sean...

18:24.171 --> 18:25.738
( tires screeching )

18:25.772 --> 18:27.907
( horn honking )

18:27.940 --> 18:30.243
BENSON:
What are you
running from, Sean?

18:30.277 --> 18:32.245
We just want
to have a little chat.

18:32.279 --> 18:33.613
You're under arrest
for the murders

18:33.646 --> 18:35.315
of Tariq Assad and Mira Elbisi.

18:35.348 --> 18:36.549
You don't want
to do this.

18:36.583 --> 18:37.417
Just listen to me.

18:37.450 --> 18:39.252
You have the right to remain...
Shut up!

18:39.286 --> 18:40.620
You have the right
to remain silent.

18:40.653 --> 18:41.821
If you give up that right,

18:41.854 --> 18:43.890
anything you say
can and will be
used against you...

18:43.923 --> 18:45.692
But you're like me;
I know you are, man!

18:45.725 --> 18:47.260
You have the right
to an attorney.

18:49.629 --> 18:50.863
Been in some
trouble before,

18:50.897 --> 18:52.399
so when I saw
you two coming,

18:52.432 --> 18:53.333
I automatically ran.

18:53.366 --> 18:55.502
But not because you
burned two people alive.

18:57.670 --> 18:59.672
See, you know, it's like...

19:01.641 --> 19:03.876
If somebody was going to do
what you say that I did...

19:03.910 --> 19:05.245
BENSON:
Somebody.

19:05.278 --> 19:07.647
Meaning not you.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.683
Yeah.

19:10.717 --> 19:13.520
If this man was to do this,
and maybe he knew

19:13.553 --> 19:16.223
that these people only
pretended to be good,

19:16.256 --> 19:19.492
but secretly... they weren't...

19:19.526 --> 19:21.961
well, then, you'd
understand why he did it.

19:21.994 --> 19:24.231
This man knew
they were bad.

19:24.264 --> 19:25.498
How'd he know?

19:25.532 --> 19:27.834
Maybe by the color
of their skin,

19:27.867 --> 19:30.370
their voices...

19:30.403 --> 19:32.405
and because they're a danger
to our way of life.

19:32.439 --> 19:33.740
Way of life?

19:33.773 --> 19:34.874
Which way is that?

19:34.907 --> 19:36.843
Freedom, democracy.

19:38.845 --> 19:41.214
If these people don't believe
in those things,

19:41.248 --> 19:44.917
and they get money for terrorism
from overseas...

19:44.951 --> 19:49.256
well, somebody ought
to kill them, right?

19:52.325 --> 19:53.526
Almost dissociating,

19:53.560 --> 19:55.328
as if this
isn't about him.

19:55.362 --> 19:57.530
Sounds like he wants Olivia's
and Elliot's approval.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.631
Well, it makes
you wonder

19:58.665 --> 20:00.733
whose approval
he really wants.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.403
Fuel oil in Sean's truck
is a perfect match

20:03.436 --> 20:04.537
to the victims.

20:04.571 --> 20:06.973
36 million gallons sold
every ten seconds.

20:07.006 --> 20:09.942
The dumbest lawyer in town
can do an O.J. DNA with it.

20:09.976 --> 20:11.278
The lab says

20:11.311 --> 20:12.879
the oil was accelerated
with benzene.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.881
Munch and Fin
are going to need
a search warrant

20:14.914 --> 20:15.882
for the kid's
apartment.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.284
It's done. He saying anything?

20:17.317 --> 20:18.418
HUANG:
Not directly.

20:18.451 --> 20:19.752
Likes the sound
of his own voice.

20:19.786 --> 20:22.722
Well, call me
if he gives us anything useful.

20:24.624 --> 20:25.825
Any suggestions?

20:25.858 --> 20:27.360
Keep him talking.

20:27.394 --> 20:28.528
This man wants
to confess,

20:28.561 --> 20:31.464
but first, he
needs to be heard.

20:31.498 --> 20:32.665
Till he says
the magic words,

20:32.699 --> 20:33.800
"I want a lawyer."

20:33.833 --> 20:35.668
No. He won't hide
behind a lawyer.

20:35.702 --> 20:37.870
They keep listening,
he'll keep talking.

20:42.509 --> 20:44.277
WOMAN:
What did my son do?

20:44.311 --> 20:45.745
He's not a criminal.
Yes, ma'am.

20:45.778 --> 20:46.913
Sean's boss called.

20:46.946 --> 20:48.315
He said you dragged him away.

20:48.348 --> 20:49.616
I called the Police Department.

20:49.649 --> 20:51.384
They said
they'd never heard of my son.

20:51.418 --> 20:52.819
He's at our
precinct, ma'am.

20:52.852 --> 20:53.986
You have to stop.

20:54.020 --> 20:55.355
You have to leave right now.

20:55.388 --> 20:56.889
You'd better look
at that search warrant.

20:56.923 --> 20:58.325
You don't stay out
of our way,

20:58.358 --> 20:59.892
we're going to have
to arrest you, too.

20:59.926 --> 21:00.927
MUNCH:
Check this out.

21:00.960 --> 21:02.395
The Citizen's
Survival Manual

21:02.429 --> 21:03.530
published by

21:03.563 --> 21:04.797
The White People's Press.

21:04.831 --> 21:07.667
"Chapter Six: Fires
and How to Start Them."

21:07.700 --> 21:09.936
Why do these publishers
always have post office boxes

21:09.969 --> 21:11.604
and not real addresses?

21:11.638 --> 21:13.540
'Cause they know
we're looking for them.

21:13.573 --> 21:15.675
Cleaning fluid.

21:15.708 --> 21:16.943
Ingredients:

21:16.976 --> 21:18.845
dichloramethane

21:18.878 --> 21:20.880
and- what do you know--
benzene.

21:24.884 --> 21:26.853
Sean, you got some decisions
to make here, man,

21:26.886 --> 21:28.087
and you got to make them now.

21:28.120 --> 21:29.822
Why?

21:29.856 --> 21:31.591
No one's going
to put me in jail.

21:31.624 --> 21:32.759
You know?

21:32.792 --> 21:34.093
Once they understand.

21:34.126 --> 21:35.828
Well, what
are they going
to understand?

21:35.862 --> 21:36.963
Talk to me, talk to me.

21:36.996 --> 21:38.698
What are they going
to understand?

21:38.731 --> 21:41.334
How in the hell did you
get yourself into this mess?

21:41.368 --> 21:42.835
I don't know.

21:42.869 --> 21:44.837
You come from
where I come from, and...

21:44.871 --> 21:46.105
( sighs )

21:46.138 --> 21:48.708
Thing's are supposed
to be different.

21:48.741 --> 21:50.710
I'm a real American.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.845
I was born here.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.080
It-It should be easier.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.615
I understand
what you mean,

21:55.648 --> 21:57.417
and it obviously
pisses you off,

21:57.450 --> 21:58.551
so what do you do?

21:58.585 --> 21:59.686
What do you do?

21:59.719 --> 22:01.120
( door opening )

22:01.153 --> 22:02.489
We just got some news.

22:02.522 --> 22:05.525
They found your can
of cleaning fluid.

22:05.558 --> 22:07.527
It's got benzene in it.

22:07.560 --> 22:08.728
You used it as an accelerant.

22:08.761 --> 22:09.829
I told you

22:09.862 --> 22:11.063
what I know.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.566
How much longer are you going
to keep me here?

22:13.600 --> 22:15.935
It's entirely up to you.

22:15.968 --> 22:17.937
See, you just don't get it,
do you?

22:17.970 --> 22:19.739
( sighs )

22:19.772 --> 22:21.408
Things were different
when I grew up.

22:21.441 --> 22:23.009
You didn't have these... people.

22:23.042 --> 22:25.111
Look, there's always
been foreigners here.

22:25.144 --> 22:25.912
We're all foreigners.

22:25.945 --> 22:27.680
This country is
built of immigrants.

22:27.714 --> 22:29.015
SEAN:
Yeah, now they come over here

22:29.048 --> 22:30.383
and they rent places in Jersey

22:30.417 --> 22:31.684
and they set up
their little cells

22:31.718 --> 22:32.519
and they bomb buildings.

22:32.552 --> 22:34.153
Did somebody tell you
that Mira Albisi

22:34.186 --> 22:36.022
and Tariq Assad
were involved
in 9/11?

22:36.055 --> 22:36.956
SEAN:
Well, I heard Arabs

22:36.989 --> 22:38.891
all over the country
had advance warning,

22:38.925 --> 22:40.126
sold their houses and moved back

22:40.159 --> 22:41.561
to their hellholes
in the desert.

22:41.594 --> 22:42.795
And what about
the street vendors

22:42.829 --> 22:44.531
and the cabbies
who were told to stay away

22:44.564 --> 22:45.865
from the Trade Center
that morning?

22:45.898 --> 22:48.000
Those were rumors,
Sean, rumors.

22:48.034 --> 22:50.069
I call 'em like I see 'em.

22:51.538 --> 22:52.805
What do you think?

22:57.544 --> 22:59.512
( sighs )

22:59.546 --> 23:00.647
Well, I'll tell you.

23:00.680 --> 23:03.650
I see those people walking
down the street, and I admit,

23:03.683 --> 23:05.718
I don't like them being here.

23:07.820 --> 23:08.955
Yeah?

23:08.988 --> 23:10.122
Yeah.

23:14.561 --> 23:16.529
Stabler?

23:16.563 --> 23:18.431
Yeah.

23:18.465 --> 23:20.533
That Irish?

23:21.834 --> 23:23.603
Yeah.

23:27.006 --> 23:30.076
I, um...

23:30.109 --> 23:32.078
I went to Holy Name.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.546
You?

23:33.580 --> 23:36.683
Sisters of Mercy.

23:36.716 --> 23:37.817
You go to college?

23:37.850 --> 23:39.218
Yeah, I went
to night school.

23:39.251 --> 23:41.888
Just got out of the Marines,

23:41.921 --> 23:43.923
but, uh, I got my BA.

23:45.725 --> 23:46.826
So, now, how come

23:46.859 --> 23:48.094
you had to go
into the service

23:48.127 --> 23:49.696
instead of straight to college?

23:49.729 --> 23:50.697
My dad was a cop.

23:50.730 --> 23:51.698
I got two sisters,

23:51.731 --> 23:53.199
three brothers. You know?

23:53.232 --> 23:54.701
Not a lot of money going around.

23:54.734 --> 23:57.704
You see, that's
exactly my point.

23:57.737 --> 23:58.705
I didn't get to go myself

23:58.738 --> 24:00.840
'cause all the places were
taken up by Arabs,

24:00.873 --> 24:02.642
who come over here
with their oil money,

24:02.675 --> 24:04.611
and they buy up all the slots
in the schools

24:04.644 --> 24:06.746
with the money
that we paid them.

24:06.779 --> 24:07.947
You're right.

24:07.980 --> 24:09.115
That's not fair.

24:09.148 --> 24:12.118
That's not fair.

24:12.151 --> 24:14.153
Yeah, it's a bitch.

24:15.755 --> 24:18.157
So you understand?

24:20.226 --> 24:23.262
One of my best friends died
in the World Trade Center.

24:23.295 --> 24:26.666
What do you think?

24:29.769 --> 24:31.871
See, you don't get it.

24:35.908 --> 24:38.010
He gets it.

24:42.181 --> 24:45.184
Gas chromo on
the benzene was
a dead-on match

24:45.217 --> 24:47.754
to the residue on
both the victims.

24:47.787 --> 24:48.888
This going anywhere?

24:48.921 --> 24:50.289
No, I thought he'd crack.

24:50.322 --> 24:51.958
He's having too good a time.

24:51.991 --> 24:54.026
I can try and go
and light him up.

24:54.060 --> 24:55.695
It's been four-and-a-half hours.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.897
Knock yourself out.

25:01.267 --> 25:04.937
Detective Tutuola,
Sean Webster.

25:06.238 --> 25:09.241
And what's he doing here?

25:09.275 --> 25:12.011
You invited him?

25:12.044 --> 25:14.647
You don't like me very much,
do you?

25:14.681 --> 25:15.548
BENSON:
Actually,

25:15.582 --> 25:17.149
I'm not all that invested
either way.

25:17.183 --> 25:18.150
What do you
see in her?

25:18.184 --> 25:19.018
You know
what I see?

25:19.051 --> 25:20.820
I think she's got
some color in her.

25:20.853 --> 25:23.122
What's in you?

25:23.155 --> 25:25.291
Arab? Raghead?

25:25.324 --> 25:27.059
Oh, and you look it, too, boy.

25:27.093 --> 25:29.929
You got some
raghead in you?

25:29.962 --> 25:31.330
In Africa, folks moved around,

25:31.363 --> 25:33.132
intermixing for thousands
of years.

25:33.165 --> 25:34.300
I could be part Arab.

25:34.333 --> 25:35.935
Oh.

25:35.968 --> 25:36.903
That would explain

25:36.936 --> 25:40.206
why your coon brothers went
to the enemy.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.741
Black Muslims.

25:41.774 --> 25:44.343
Traitors to the American people.

25:44.376 --> 25:46.345
You can call me anything
you want, Sean.

25:46.378 --> 25:47.714
Coon, traitor,

25:47.747 --> 25:49.916
raghead, towelhead.

25:49.949 --> 25:52.318
I got some words for you:

25:52.351 --> 25:54.086
killer, psycho.

25:54.120 --> 25:56.355
Hey...

25:56.388 --> 25:58.357
I'm no psycho.

25:58.390 --> 26:00.793
You burned two innocent people
to death.

26:00.827 --> 26:01.794
They weren't innocent!

26:01.828 --> 26:04.096
They had to die,
or they're going to kill us all.

26:04.130 --> 26:05.698
Well, who was Mira Elbisi
gonna kill?

26:05.732 --> 26:06.733
She was working for peace.

26:06.766 --> 26:08.901
I didn't want to kill her!

26:19.145 --> 26:22.849
You tore up that innocent woman
with that pipe,

26:22.882 --> 26:24.851
then you burned her alive.

26:24.884 --> 26:27.086
You're sick.

26:29.421 --> 26:32.792
She said
that she was a good American,

26:32.825 --> 26:35.094
and that raghead said
that he was our friend.

26:36.663 --> 26:38.130
They're all liars.

26:38.164 --> 26:39.398
We have to stop them,

26:39.431 --> 26:41.701
or they're going to kill us all!

26:46.739 --> 26:48.775
You okay?

26:48.808 --> 26:51.010
I'll take words anytime
over being raped with a pipe.

26:51.043 --> 26:52.812
You've got thicker
skin than me.

26:52.845 --> 26:53.946
Couple hundred years,

26:53.980 --> 26:56.215
races will be so mixed up,
it won't matter.

26:56.248 --> 26:58.284
No one will know
what color anyone is.

26:58.317 --> 26:59.786
He got to you.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.821
A little.

27:01.854 --> 27:03.890
He thought he'd rattle
me by calling me an Arab,

27:03.923 --> 27:05.024
but the truth is,

27:05.057 --> 27:06.859
I don't know anything
about my father.

27:06.893 --> 27:08.961
Race and color are the
least of my questions.

27:08.995 --> 27:10.396
Probation report.

27:10.429 --> 27:11.964
Sean Webster, aged 16,

27:11.998 --> 27:13.766
attacked a Pakistani kid
at school.

27:13.800 --> 27:15.768
Tried as an adult,
sentenced as a juvenile.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.003
No time served.

27:17.036 --> 27:18.237
Father died when he was ten.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.772
Mother had a nervous breakdown,

27:19.806 --> 27:21.874
had to move out of the house
from Long Island.

27:21.908 --> 27:23.175
Brought the kid into the city.

27:23.209 --> 27:25.177
He's been in and out
of trouble ever since.

27:25.211 --> 27:27.246
You want us to feel
sorry for him?

27:27.279 --> 27:29.448
Oh, no. He's a racist
son of a bitch.

27:29.481 --> 27:31.784
With a damn good lawyer.

27:33.052 --> 27:34.386
The confession's inadmissible.

27:34.420 --> 27:35.454
He was Mirandized.

27:35.487 --> 27:36.789
He never asked for a lawyer.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.190
You can stop
grandstanding, Oliver.

27:38.224 --> 27:39.458
This isn't a
press conference.

27:39.491 --> 27:41.393
You kept him hidden
from his own mother.

27:41.427 --> 27:42.929
CRAGEN:
No, no. Our
detectives

27:42.962 --> 27:43.930
told his mother we had him.

27:43.963 --> 27:46.132
Yeah, he was offered his
phone call. He declined.

27:46.165 --> 27:48.234
The confession was provoked.
I'll get it excluded.

27:48.267 --> 27:50.302
NOVAK:
Well, there's not much
law on provocation.

27:50.336 --> 27:52.104
And considering
how wired your client is,

27:52.138 --> 27:53.305
I'd say, he provokes easily.

27:53.339 --> 27:54.673
The confession will stick.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.911
Maybe you're right.

27:58.945 --> 28:00.913
See you in court.

28:06.786 --> 28:08.087
I've seen that smile.

28:08.120 --> 28:10.289
Usually before he demolishes
the prosecution's case.

28:10.322 --> 28:13.492
How did that kid's mother find
Oliver Gates?

28:13.525 --> 28:16.228
He's one of the major opponents
of the hate-crimes statute.

28:16.262 --> 28:17.964
Well, he picked
the right case.

28:17.997 --> 28:19.365
Well, we'll deny him
the pleasure.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.067
I don't need
a sentencing enhancement.

28:21.100 --> 28:22.835
We'll convict Webster
for both killings.

28:22.869 --> 28:24.103
He does consecutive time.

28:24.136 --> 28:26.038
It's 50 years before
he sees a parole board.

28:26.072 --> 28:28.440
My opinion?

28:28.474 --> 28:30.376
You need a hate-crimes charge.

28:30.409 --> 28:31.443
It goes to motive.

28:31.477 --> 28:35.047
I think we should prosecute
action, not thought.

28:35.081 --> 28:36.248
Webster killed out of hate.

28:36.282 --> 28:37.316
That matters.

28:37.349 --> 28:38.317
Okay, you tell me.

28:38.350 --> 28:39.886
Does that mean

28:39.919 --> 28:42.254
a black man who kills a Klansman
does additional time?

28:42.288 --> 28:43.856
Or a gay man
who kills a homophobe?

28:43.890 --> 28:45.291
I mean, where do we draw
the line?

28:45.324 --> 28:46.859
Hate crimes incite
other people.

28:46.893 --> 28:47.994
( phone ringing )

28:48.027 --> 28:49.128
It's a kind of terror.

28:49.161 --> 28:50.997
We use the statute
to make a point.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.264
( phone continues ringing )

28:52.298 --> 28:54.433
Cragen.

28:55.434 --> 28:57.937
Yeah. We'll be right there.

28:59.939 --> 29:02.008
Sean Webster just killed
a Muslim prisoner

29:02.041 --> 29:04.010
at Central Booking.

29:04.043 --> 29:05.411
MAN:
Webster was in the pens,

29:05.444 --> 29:08.014
waiting for arraignment
when he just flipped out.

29:08.047 --> 29:09.415
He stomped the Arab guy
into a pulp.

29:09.448 --> 29:10.817
Why didn't you
segregate him?

29:10.850 --> 29:11.984
He's booked for two murders.

29:12.018 --> 29:13.419
We didn't know
about a racial angle.

29:13.452 --> 29:15.788
Nobody said squat, okay?

29:15.822 --> 29:17.423
Your lawyer's going
to be pissed, Sean.

29:17.456 --> 29:19.058
You just convicted yourself.

29:19.091 --> 29:22.128
One less Arab,
one less terrorist.

29:22.161 --> 29:24.296
GATES:
Sean, seal your lips,
not another word.

29:24.330 --> 29:27.099
Actually, my client just proved
my theory correct.

29:27.133 --> 29:28.300
NOVAK:
What?

29:28.334 --> 29:29.368
Another murder
gets him off?

29:29.401 --> 29:30.369
No. It gets him sent

29:30.402 --> 29:31.303
to a mental hospital

29:31.337 --> 29:33.239
for the treatment
he so desperately needs.

29:33.272 --> 29:34.440
An insanity defense?

29:34.473 --> 29:35.942
You've got no grounds.

29:35.975 --> 29:37.009
Sure I do.

29:37.043 --> 29:38.077
His genes.

29:38.110 --> 29:39.578
The motion will be filed
tomorrow.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.381
Sean Webster is biologically
and genetically predisposed

29:42.414 --> 29:43.515
to hatred and violence.

29:43.549 --> 29:45.351
He had no control
over his actions.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.353
It'll never fly.

29:47.386 --> 29:48.855
You put a man's genes on trial,

29:48.888 --> 29:50.857
nobody will ever be responsible
for anything.

29:51.891 --> 29:53.960
It's the ultimate defense.

30:02.468 --> 30:04.170
NOVAK:
Your Honor, this
defense is absurd.

30:04.203 --> 30:06.072
The defendant sodomized
and burned two people

30:06.105 --> 30:08.908
and beat a prisoner to death.

30:08.941 --> 30:11.443
His guilt cannot be determined
by his genes.

30:11.477 --> 30:13.479
Are you citing the
law, Counselor,

30:13.512 --> 30:15.314
or is this just
your opinion?

30:15.347 --> 30:16.282
The law is clear.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.918
New York doesn't have
an insanity defense

30:18.951 --> 30:20.452
of "irresistible impulse."

30:20.486 --> 30:21.888
We ask that it
be excluded.

30:21.921 --> 30:22.955
Thank you, Ms. Novak.

30:22.989 --> 30:24.190
Proceed.

30:24.223 --> 30:26.025
GATES:
Thank you, Your Honor.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.459
My client, Sean Webster,

30:27.493 --> 30:30.562
believes that Muslims
are a danger to our society,

30:30.596 --> 30:32.331
and therefore,
he's driven to kill them.

30:32.364 --> 30:33.866
Now, we will prove

30:33.900 --> 30:35.601
that he's not responsible
for these crimes

30:35.634 --> 30:37.203
because he was born

30:37.236 --> 30:39.438
with hatred and violence
hard-wired into his brain.

30:39.471 --> 30:40.539
Your Honor,
the defendant

30:40.572 --> 30:41.607
ran from the police.

30:41.640 --> 30:42.875
He knew right from wrong.

30:42.909 --> 30:43.876
That negates

30:43.910 --> 30:44.977
a mental disease
defense.

30:45.011 --> 30:46.078
Michigan v. Carpenter.

30:46.112 --> 30:47.046
Not wanting to be caught

30:47.079 --> 30:49.181
is different
than knowing right from wrong.

30:49.215 --> 30:51.450
And what better proof
he can't control his actions

30:51.483 --> 30:53.485
in killing another inmate
while awaiting two trials?

30:53.519 --> 30:55.221
JUDGE:
You know, you
haven't convinced me

30:55.254 --> 30:56.288
that biology is the issue

30:56.322 --> 30:59.658
or that it's proper for me
to allow this defense.

30:59.691 --> 31:00.960
U.S. v. Robertson.

31:00.993 --> 31:02.561
The trial judge must consider

31:02.594 --> 31:05.231
the defendant's ability
to control himself.

31:05.264 --> 31:06.632
I know the case, Counselor.

31:06.665 --> 31:10.236
I went to law school, too.

31:10.269 --> 31:12.038
I'll review
your scientific evidence.

31:12.071 --> 31:15.074
And I presume you have

31:15.107 --> 31:17.143
a bang-up expert witness.

31:17.176 --> 31:18.644
The esteemed Dr. Emily Sopher,

31:18.677 --> 31:21.447
Chair of Neurobiology
at the Mid-Hudson Institute.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.515
JUDGE:
Documents in my
chambers, 48 hours.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.317
You'll make your
witness available

31:25.351 --> 31:26.652
to the District Attorney.

31:26.685 --> 31:28.187
( gavel bangs )

31:28.220 --> 31:29.621
The whole defense is bogus.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.523
The judge should've
dismissed it.

31:31.557 --> 31:32.658
He still might.

31:32.691 --> 31:33.625
Casey!

31:33.659 --> 31:36.128
Now, this is gonna be a blast,
don't you think?

31:36.162 --> 31:37.396
I think it's a bad joke.

31:37.429 --> 31:40.266
Your client killed that inmate
just to make himself look crazy.

31:40.299 --> 31:41.567
No, he can't control

31:41.600 --> 31:44.270
his genetic predisposition
to hatred.

31:44.303 --> 31:46.305
Why are you doing this,
Oliver?

31:46.338 --> 31:47.406
It's the next frontier.

31:47.439 --> 31:48.674
I like being
on the cutting edge.

31:48.707 --> 31:50.542
You like being
in the spotlight.

31:50.576 --> 31:52.678
That, too.

31:52.711 --> 31:55.314
Why, it must be genetic.

31:56.348 --> 31:59.285
You think his expert
can convince a jury?

31:59.318 --> 32:00.987
Sopher's a world-class
neurobiologist.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.022
There's no telling what
they're going to think.

32:03.055 --> 32:04.156
You talk to Sopher.

32:04.190 --> 32:05.491
See what you think.

32:06.525 --> 32:08.560
Read the research
on brain chemistry.

32:08.594 --> 32:10.296
Multiple studies, not just mine.

32:10.329 --> 32:12.431
Genotypes that cause low levels

32:12.464 --> 32:15.434
of monoamine oxidase A
predict violence.

32:15.467 --> 32:18.004
Maybe violence is
genetically influenced,

32:18.037 --> 32:20.172
but hatred is a
learned behavior.

32:20.206 --> 32:22.074
Actually,
my research shows

32:22.108 --> 32:24.443
that emotions
are genetically determined.

32:24.476 --> 32:27.579
Someday we'll treat
the Sean Websters of the world

32:27.613 --> 32:29.248
with gene therapy

32:29.281 --> 32:31.150
before they commit
terrible crimes.

32:31.183 --> 32:34.120
You start treating people
you think will be criminals,

32:34.153 --> 32:36.288
you turn psychiatry
into social control.

32:36.322 --> 32:39.391
All due respect, Dr. Huang,
you're living in the past.

32:39.425 --> 32:41.027
You're living in the future.

32:41.060 --> 32:43.462
You might be able
to prove your theories then,

32:43.495 --> 32:45.331
but you can't do it now.

32:45.364 --> 32:46.598
I can convince a jury.

32:46.632 --> 32:48.400
Do you think
that a courtroom

32:48.434 --> 32:51.103
is the right place
to test-drive your ideas?

32:51.137 --> 32:52.204
Where should we do it?

32:52.238 --> 32:55.074
At some academic conference
where no one'll notice?

32:55.107 --> 32:58.377
You might not want to testify
after you read my research.

33:01.680 --> 33:05.684
GATES:
Dr. Sopher, are hatred

33:05.717 --> 33:08.220
and racist violence
mental diseases?

33:08.254 --> 33:12.224
Yes. They're caused by
genetic abnormalities
in the brain.

33:12.258 --> 33:14.426
Where in the brain
does this occur?

33:14.460 --> 33:15.661
In the prefrontal cortex

33:15.694 --> 33:18.097
which controls emotions
and which is smaller

33:18.130 --> 33:20.299
in people convicted
of violent hate crimes.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.769
Dr. Sopher, were you able to
examine Sean Webster's brain?

33:23.802 --> 33:25.371
Yes, first slide please.

33:25.404 --> 33:26.638
( machine clicks )

33:26.672 --> 33:28.374
These images are
called PET scans.

33:28.407 --> 33:31.110
The one on the left shows
a normal prefrontal cortex.

33:31.143 --> 33:33.445
On the right
is Sean Webster's.

33:33.479 --> 33:35.347
His is abnormally small.

33:35.381 --> 33:38.317
More important, violent
people have more activity

33:38.350 --> 33:41.353
than normal people
in another section
of the brain.

33:41.387 --> 33:43.255
It's called the subcortex.

33:43.289 --> 33:44.390
How can you tell?

33:44.423 --> 33:45.624
Well, for example,

33:45.657 --> 33:47.359
here's a scan of the subcortex

33:47.393 --> 33:48.794
of a neo-Nazi skinhead

33:48.827 --> 33:51.397
who was convicted
of attacking Jews.

33:51.430 --> 33:55.301
This is his subcortex after
he hears the word "Jew."

33:55.334 --> 33:56.735
Note how it lights up.

33:56.768 --> 33:59.671
Did you perform this
test on Sean Webster?

33:59.705 --> 34:01.640
Yes.

34:01.673 --> 34:03.509
His subcortex lit
up the same way

34:03.542 --> 34:05.277
when he heard
the word "Arab."

34:05.311 --> 34:07.279
Your conclusion,
Dr. Sopher?

34:07.313 --> 34:09.215
The mere mention of Arabs

34:09.248 --> 34:13.152
puts Sean Webster into a state
of extreme hatred and violence.

34:13.185 --> 34:14.553
Thank you.

34:14.586 --> 34:16.555
Your witness.

34:16.588 --> 34:20.159
Can you tell by looking
at pictures of people's brains

34:20.192 --> 34:22.294
whether they'll kill
other people?

34:22.328 --> 34:24.563
That's difficult to say.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.765
Your Honor?

34:26.798 --> 34:28.300
Answer the question, Dr. Sopher.

34:28.334 --> 34:30.869
With enough time
and sufficient PET scans,

34:30.902 --> 34:35.174
yes, I'll eventually be able to
predict who will become violent.

34:35.207 --> 34:36.708
"Eventually predict"?

34:36.742 --> 34:38.310
Eventually.

34:38.344 --> 34:40.078
But not now?

34:41.913 --> 34:44.750
No.

34:44.783 --> 34:45.884
HUANG:
I turned to colleagues

34:45.917 --> 34:47.453
at the Ranney
Psychiatric Institute

34:47.486 --> 34:49.121
to replicate
Dr. Sopher's experiments.

34:49.155 --> 34:51.123
Tell us what you found,
Dr. Huang.

34:51.157 --> 34:52.758
We interviewed
several people.

34:52.791 --> 34:55.727
Number one is the PET
scan of an orthodox rabbi.

34:55.761 --> 34:58.597
We showed him that
picture of Nazi officers.

34:58.630 --> 35:02.201
His subcortex responded
exactly like Sean Webster's.

35:02.234 --> 35:06.638
Number two is the subcortex
of an African-American minister.

35:06.672 --> 35:08.674
We showed him that picture
of the Ku Klux Klan

35:08.707 --> 35:09.875
at a rally burning a cross.

35:09.908 --> 35:12.211
So, both of these men

35:12.244 --> 35:14.480
have the same subcortical
activity as Sean Webster?

35:14.513 --> 35:16.348
That's correct.

35:16.382 --> 35:19.418
What do these results
mean to you, Doctor?

35:19.451 --> 35:21.753
That even if behavior
is partly genetic,

35:21.787 --> 35:23.755
it's about our experiences,
also.

35:23.789 --> 35:27.793
After you're bitten by a dog,
you might not like them,

35:27.826 --> 35:30.429
but you weren't born
to hate them.

35:31.463 --> 35:33.499
Your witness.

35:33.532 --> 35:37.369
Dr. Huang, is high cholesterol
genetically caused?

35:37.403 --> 35:38.637
We think so.

35:38.670 --> 35:40.872
Can you identify the genes
which cause it?

35:40.906 --> 35:43.342
In the average patient, not yet.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.411
No. So, if I have
high cholesterol

35:45.444 --> 35:47.246
and I die of a heart attack

35:47.279 --> 35:49.915
it may have been
genetically predetermined?

35:49.948 --> 35:52.184
Yes.

35:52.218 --> 35:54.253
But you're saying
that Sean Webster,

35:54.286 --> 35:58.790
and not his genetic make-up,
is responsible for his violence?

35:58.824 --> 36:01.327
Dr. Huang?

36:01.360 --> 36:02.661
It's not that simple.

36:02.694 --> 36:04.196
Thank you.

36:04.230 --> 36:06.398
I was thinking the same thing.

36:06.432 --> 36:07.799
I wasn't finished.

36:07.833 --> 36:09.501
Dr. Sopher identifies
violent people

36:09.535 --> 36:11.237
after they've committed
hate crimes.

36:11.270 --> 36:12.971
That doesn't mean
she can predict violence

36:13.004 --> 36:14.206
based on their brain patterns.

36:14.240 --> 36:16.942
No more than you can predict
someone having a heart attack

36:16.975 --> 36:18.710
based solely
on their cholesterol level.

36:18.744 --> 36:21.747
But your rabbi or minister could
become violent at any moment.

36:21.780 --> 36:22.814
Any of us could.

36:22.848 --> 36:23.982
My point, thank you.

36:24.015 --> 36:26.718
That includes Sean Webster.

36:30.956 --> 36:33.692
When I was a kid, I
was always in trouble.

36:33.725 --> 36:36.695
The school sent me
to a therapist,

36:36.728 --> 36:38.564
but it never helped.

36:38.597 --> 36:40.966
What kind of trouble?

36:40.999 --> 36:42.934
Fights mostly.

36:42.968 --> 36:45.604
Who did you fight?

36:45.637 --> 36:46.838
Arabs.

36:46.872 --> 36:48.340
People like Tariq Assad

36:48.374 --> 36:50.008
and Mira Elbisi?

36:50.041 --> 36:51.877
Yeah.

36:52.911 --> 36:55.447
What made you choose them?

36:55.481 --> 36:59.418
I saw this poster for
a panel they were on.

36:59.451 --> 37:01.487
I went and I listened.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.990
You know, they say
that they're our friends.

37:05.023 --> 37:07.693
They're more dangerous
than the ones

37:07.726 --> 37:09.895
who admit they're our enemies.

37:09.928 --> 37:12.864
Did you hear voices telling you
to kill them?

37:12.898 --> 37:14.600
No, sir.

37:14.633 --> 37:16.001
Crazy people hear voices.

37:16.034 --> 37:17.769
I'm not crazy.

37:18.770 --> 37:22.474
But, still, you felt
you had to kill them.

37:22.508 --> 37:25.644
They hate and want to destroy
our country.

37:25.677 --> 37:29.448
Do you think killing people
is wrong?

37:29.481 --> 37:31.049
We kill people in wars,

37:31.082 --> 37:34.420
and we're at war
with these people, right?

37:34.453 --> 37:36.622
Thank you.

37:36.655 --> 37:37.889
Your witness.

37:37.923 --> 37:39.758
So you hate Muslims.

37:39.791 --> 37:43.028
Do you hate black people,
too, Sean?

37:43.061 --> 37:44.996
No, ma'am.

37:45.030 --> 37:48.767
Well, I mean, except
for the ones who are Muslims.

37:48.800 --> 37:51.770
Do you hate the Chinese,
Japanese?

37:51.803 --> 37:53.305
No, ma'am.

37:53.339 --> 37:55.707
So your hatred's
pretty specific.

37:55.741 --> 37:57.843
Muslims come here,

37:57.876 --> 38:02.648
and they study
engineering and aviation,

38:02.681 --> 38:04.916
and then they use it
to attack us,

38:04.950 --> 38:07.386
and we fought for them
in Bosnia,

38:07.419 --> 38:10.389
and my dad fought for them
in Desert Storm,

38:10.422 --> 38:12.458
and he died for his country.

38:12.491 --> 38:13.759
They killed your father?

38:13.792 --> 38:15.427
Muslims killed your father?

38:15.461 --> 38:17.062
And they turn around,
and they attack us!

38:17.095 --> 38:19.831
And they're gonna explode
chemical warfare in the subways!

38:19.865 --> 38:21.400
Sean!

38:21.433 --> 38:23.602
And poison our water supplies
and blow up bridges!

38:23.635 --> 38:25.003
Your Honor, may
we have a recess?

38:25.036 --> 38:27.873
JUDGE:
I'm going to recess
while the defendant

38:27.906 --> 38:28.974
regains control
of himself.

38:29.007 --> 38:30.809
...while they stockpile weapons
of mass destruction!

38:30.842 --> 38:33.311
( gavel banging )

38:34.446 --> 38:36.615
He said his father
died in Desert Storm.

38:36.648 --> 38:39.818
I need to know whether Sean
killed out of hate or revenge.

38:39.851 --> 38:41.587
Find out how
the father died.

38:42.588 --> 38:44.790
GATES:
Casey, just accept it.

38:44.823 --> 38:46.091
It's over.

38:46.124 --> 38:47.926
If you want a deal,
the answer is no.

38:47.959 --> 38:49.695
I thought you'd jump
at the chance.

38:49.728 --> 38:51.563
I wouldn't give you
the satisfaction.

38:51.597 --> 38:52.564
The jury's buying it.

38:52.598 --> 38:54.900
See, they understand hatred
'cause at one point,

38:54.933 --> 38:56.435
they've hated
someone themselves.

38:56.468 --> 38:58.136
Well, none of them
have killed three people.

38:58.169 --> 38:59.638
But they understand
the impulse,

38:59.671 --> 39:01.006
and they won't
blame Sean for his.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.941
No deal.
There's no way I acknowledge

39:02.974 --> 39:05.611
an ounce of validity
in this cockamamie defense.

39:06.612 --> 39:08.647
NOVAK:
You will realize

39:08.680 --> 39:11.082
that it's based on speculation,
on maybes and could bes.

39:11.116 --> 39:12.851
On maybes and...
( knocking on door )

39:12.884 --> 39:15.120
Practicing your summation?

39:15.153 --> 39:16.588
Yeah. It's
not working.

39:16.622 --> 39:17.856
It may not have to.

39:17.889 --> 39:19.458
I think I found what you wanted.

39:19.491 --> 39:22.594
Seth Webster--
that's Sean Webster's father--

39:22.628 --> 39:24.896
he fought in Desert Storm...

39:24.930 --> 39:26.532
didn't die there.

39:30.502 --> 39:32.504
( buzzer sounds )

39:36.041 --> 39:37.743
What's this about?

39:37.776 --> 39:39.010
You still want a deal?

39:39.044 --> 39:41.980
You've come to your senses.

39:42.013 --> 39:43.649
It's about you coming to yours.

39:43.682 --> 39:44.850
He pleads three counts,

39:44.883 --> 39:47.018
Murder Two,
consecutive sentences.

39:47.052 --> 39:49.655
Have a nice day.

39:59.164 --> 40:01.099
GATES:
Who's this?

40:03.134 --> 40:04.870
Get him out.

40:04.903 --> 40:07.773
Don't you want
to introduce Dad?

40:07.806 --> 40:09.174
Sean, what's going on?

40:09.207 --> 40:11.042
STABLER:
He never told you?

40:11.076 --> 40:13.011
His father met
an Arab woman

40:13.044 --> 40:15.914
in Kuwait,
divorced Sean's mother,

40:15.947 --> 40:17.783
remarried and moved to Detroit.

40:17.816 --> 40:20.018
You still think
it's genetics, Oliver?

40:20.051 --> 40:22.788
Why don't you
just go back

40:22.821 --> 40:24.189
to where you came from.

40:24.222 --> 40:26.858
Go back to your Arab whore.

40:26.892 --> 40:28.527
Sean, I'm sorry.

40:28.560 --> 40:30.662
What do you care, hmm?

40:30.696 --> 40:33.064
Because this is my fault.

40:33.098 --> 40:37.536
Yeah, you're damn right
it's your fault.

40:37.569 --> 40:40.806
My mom told me
that you died a hero,

40:40.839 --> 40:43.575
and you never came around
to tell me different.

40:46.111 --> 40:48.480
I go to get benefits
for college,

40:48.514 --> 40:50.949
and I find out
that he's still alive.

40:50.982 --> 40:53.819
SETH:
Sean, listen,
I wanted to see you.

40:53.852 --> 40:55.220
Your mother wouldn't let me.

40:55.253 --> 40:56.321
She had custody.

40:56.354 --> 40:59.558
She threatened that
if I even tried to come visit...

40:59.591 --> 41:00.726
Liar!

41:00.759 --> 41:03.094
You were too busy with your
half-breed kids! Admit it!

41:03.128 --> 41:06.565
She filled your head
with all this crap

41:06.598 --> 41:09.234
about Arabs
because she was angry with me.

41:09.267 --> 41:11.102
Can't you see that?

41:11.136 --> 41:13.271
She poisoned you with her hate.

41:13.304 --> 41:16.642
My mom worked her ass off
to take care of me!

41:16.675 --> 41:18.143
You never gave a damn!

41:18.176 --> 41:20.879
Oh, Sean.

41:20.912 --> 41:22.748
I hate your stinking guts!

41:22.781 --> 41:23.782
( spits )

41:23.815 --> 41:26.151
If I had a gun right now,

41:26.184 --> 41:28.720
I'd shoot you in the head,
and then I'd go back

41:28.754 --> 41:31.590
and I'd set your wife
and your bastard kids on fire!

41:31.623 --> 41:33.625
Get off me!

41:51.977 --> 41:53.879
Sean Webster wasn't born
that way.

41:53.912 --> 41:55.146
I don't believe anyone is.

41:55.180 --> 41:57.883
It takes a human being
to teach you to hate.

41:57.916 --> 42:01.152
"Some mysteries past
all understanding."

42:01.186 --> 42:02.320
Letters of St. Paul.

42:02.353 --> 42:05.891
The Muslim who Sean Webster
killed at Central Booking?

42:05.924 --> 42:07.626
He had friends.

42:07.659 --> 42:11.730
Webster was just stabbed
to death in the yard at Rikers.
