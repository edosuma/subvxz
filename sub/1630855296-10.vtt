["Concrete" by Barrie playing]

00:11.511 --> 00:15.765
[McEnroe] It happened at exactly 2:30 p.m.
on the last day of school.

00:16.349 --> 00:18.351
This is the outfit Devi wore.

00:18.935 --> 00:20.895
This is the car she drove.

00:21.479 --> 00:23.523
This is the lunch she ate.

00:23.606 --> 00:24.941
'Sup, clean sweep?

00:25.025 --> 00:25.984
[Aneesa] Shut up.

00:26.067 --> 00:27.235
[phone vibrates]

00:28.069 --> 00:32.824
[McEnroe] And this is the moment
Devi Vishwakumar got into Princeton.

00:34.075 --> 00:35.744
[screaming]

00:35.827 --> 00:37.787
I'm in! Guys, they let me in!

00:37.871 --> 00:39.414
-[Fabiola] Really?
-What?

00:39.497 --> 00:41.541
Oh my God, congratulations!

00:41.624 --> 00:42.917
[McEnroe] She would call her mom

00:43.001 --> 00:46.337
and be forced to FaceTime
her cousins in India soon enough,

00:46.838 --> 00:49.799
but first, there was someone else
she was dying to tell.

00:51.551 --> 00:53.344
What's going on? Why do you look weird?

00:53.928 --> 00:55.805
I'm off the wait-list.
I got into Princeton.

00:55.889 --> 00:56.973
What?

00:57.057 --> 00:59.142
Holy shit, David. That's awesome.

00:59.809 --> 01:01.561
[laughs] Congratulations.

01:01.644 --> 01:04.522
Although I really deserve the credit
for making you write that essay.

01:04.606 --> 01:06.483
Okay, whatever.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.277
So maybe we could
celebrate sometime over the summer?

01:09.986 --> 01:10.862
Oh.

01:10.945 --> 01:13.948
I'd love that, but I'm actually going away
for the summer.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.786
[gasps] Oh my God, are you getting
that Chad surgery I told you about?

01:17.869 --> 01:19.704
The one that gives you
a Hemsworth jawline?

01:19.788 --> 01:20.872
What? No, I don't need that.

01:20.955 --> 01:23.124
I'm the perfect combination
of boyish and handsome.

01:23.208 --> 01:24.876
But yeah, I'm leaving
right after graduation

01:24.959 --> 01:26.795
to take an internship
at a law firm in New York.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.464
Oh. Wow. Uh--

01:29.547 --> 01:31.758
You're, like, "leaving" leaving.

01:33.134 --> 01:34.886
So… is this it?

01:35.595 --> 01:39.766
I mean, I'll see you at graduation,
but… yeah, I guess so.

01:40.809 --> 01:41.684
Oh.

01:42.477 --> 01:46.815
Well, damn, we've been enemies
for, like, 12 years.

01:46.898 --> 01:49.359
Crazy to think it's… all just over.

01:49.442 --> 01:52.403
I know. I'm gonna miss having a nemesis.

01:53.154 --> 01:56.157
Well, you'll probably meet someone
you hate in college

01:56.241 --> 01:58.034
and forget all about me.

01:59.327 --> 02:01.871
Nah. I don't think that's possible.

02:03.540 --> 02:06.084
Wow. Really is the end of an era.

02:06.167 --> 02:08.878
I don't know what I'm gonna do
now that the Three Musketeers are over.

02:08.962 --> 02:12.382
Maybe we should just plan on doing
a monthly Zoom hang or something.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.719
-We'll figure it out. Let's go to class.
-[bell ringing]

02:18.513 --> 02:20.640
[McEnroe] Devi's victory was bittersweet.

02:20.723 --> 02:24.227
The thing she wanted most in the world
was in the palm of her hands,

02:24.310 --> 02:27.772
but something else she wanted
seemed to be slipping away.

02:28.773 --> 02:32.110
["Breaking Apart"
by Caroline Kingsbury playing]

02:33.778 --> 02:35.864
-Ah! Congrats, guys!
-[laughing]

02:35.947 --> 02:37.657
[McEnroe] Graduation day came,

02:38.241 --> 02:39.993
and for someone like Devi,

02:40.076 --> 02:42.245
who in these last four years
had experienced

02:42.328 --> 02:45.665
some of the lowest lows
and highest highs imaginable,

02:45.748 --> 02:48.418
crossing the finish line
with her best friends

02:48.501 --> 02:51.129
felt like a moment of uncomplicated joy.

02:51.880 --> 02:54.799
She also happened
to be named valedictorian,

02:54.883 --> 02:59.345
giving her a decisive victory
in her long-standing rivalry with Ben.

02:59.429 --> 03:01.055
But for the first time,

03:01.139 --> 03:03.224
she didn't feel like
rubbing his nose in it.

03:04.225 --> 03:06.352
The next day, Ben left for New York,

03:06.436 --> 03:10.190
so Devi proceeded to have
an epic last summer with her besties.

03:10.732 --> 03:12.025
And before she knew it,

03:12.108 --> 03:14.319
it was the last weekend before college,

03:14.903 --> 03:16.696
and a lot was going on.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.909
All right, not to turn this mehndi
into a logistical meeting,

03:20.992 --> 03:22.869
but we have a very packed weekend.

03:22.952 --> 03:25.538
Nirmala Mami,
I just wanna thank you once again

03:25.622 --> 03:28.875
for planning your wedding
the same weekend Devi goes to college.

03:28.958 --> 03:30.376
You must thank my astrologer.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.838
She said it was a very auspicious day
for sensuality.

03:33.922 --> 03:35.256
[Nalini] I'm sure it is.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.800
Uh, okay. Bah, bah, bah, bah…

03:37.884 --> 03:39.636
They already put the tent up
in the backyard.

03:39.719 --> 03:42.222
Oh. Nirmala Mami, do you have everything
you need for tomorrow?

03:42.305 --> 03:45.016
Yes, I picked up all my wedding jewels.

03:45.099 --> 03:47.185
I'm so excited to wear a thali again

03:47.268 --> 03:51.439
so that those bachelors at bingo
will finally realize I'm a taken woman.

03:51.522 --> 03:54.400
Hmm. Hey, Mom,
shouldn't you be taking off your thali

03:54.484 --> 03:55.902
now that you have a zaddy boyf?

03:55.985 --> 03:58.029
Devi, you can't ask that.

03:58.112 --> 03:59.530
Oh no. No, it's fine.

03:59.614 --> 04:01.908
Andres actually doesn't really care
that I wear it,

04:01.991 --> 04:03.826
and honestly, I'm just so used to it.

04:05.245 --> 04:06.621
Anyway, moving right along.

04:06.704 --> 04:09.707
Devi, you have to pack tonight.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.335
Look at me.
We leave at 6 a.m. Sunday morning,

04:12.418 --> 04:15.004
and tomorrow Aravind Uncle
is sleeping in your room.

04:15.088 --> 04:17.048
And, you know,
with the sleep apnea machine setup,

04:17.131 --> 04:19.842
you will not get access to your closet.

04:19.926 --> 04:21.678
Yes, you have told me a billion times.

04:21.761 --> 04:24.055
And yet you have waited
until the last minute to do it.

04:24.138 --> 04:27.392
And I have dragged in
that big suitcase from the garage.

04:27.475 --> 04:29.477
Please don't give me that look.
It has one good wheel.

04:29.560 --> 04:32.397
Oh, I can't believe
my baby cousin's going off to college.

04:32.480 --> 04:33.648
Maybe once you're moved in,

04:33.731 --> 04:35.358
Manish and I can come visit
from Baltimore?

04:35.942 --> 04:38.111
Yeah. How about I come visit you, Kamala?

04:38.194 --> 04:41.614
I don't need yet another friend group
of mine to know I have a hot cousin.

04:42.490 --> 04:44.367
But speaking of friends…

04:44.450 --> 04:47.036
Mom, is it still cool if I have El and Fab
come over tonight?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.955
-Please? Please?
-[huffs]

04:49.038 --> 04:50.290
Fine. But only for an hour

04:50.373 --> 04:53.251
because I promise you, Devi,
if you do not pack tonight,

04:53.334 --> 04:55.628
I'll put you in that suitcase Mafia-style.

04:55.712 --> 04:57.630
[mellow song playing]

04:58.214 --> 04:59.257
[Eleanor] Oh my God.

04:59.340 --> 05:03.720
Guys, is this gonna be the last time
we watch The Masked Singer together

05:03.803 --> 05:05.138
before you both leave?

05:05.221 --> 05:08.141
El, you can't keep crying over our lasts.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.435
It was so awkward at Yogurtland yesterday.

05:10.518 --> 05:12.562
But that was the last time
you're gonna be yelled at

05:12.645 --> 05:14.439
for taking too many samples.

05:14.522 --> 05:15.481
It's gonna be fine.

05:15.565 --> 05:18.401
We're gonna see each other a ton,
like when we come back for Thanksgiving.

05:18.484 --> 05:21.112
Oh, I'm actually not coming back
for Thanksgiving. [sighs]

05:21.195 --> 05:22.572
I have a robotics competition.

05:22.655 --> 05:24.157
But I-- I'm back at Christmas.

05:24.240 --> 05:25.408
No.

05:25.491 --> 05:28.745
Sharon planned a cruise
to Alaska at Christmas.

05:28.828 --> 05:31.581
She got a good deal
because it's gonna be dark the whole time.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.876
Okay, okay, it's fine.
What about… a classic spring break?

05:34.959 --> 05:36.002
Great. April it is.

05:36.085 --> 05:38.421
No, my spring break's in March.

05:38.504 --> 05:41.716
So, what does that leave? Next summer?

05:41.799 --> 05:44.552
No, that's a year away.
That can't be right.

05:44.635 --> 05:46.471
Okay, girls, time to wrap it up.

05:46.554 --> 05:48.681
It's late,
and Devi has a lot to do tonight.

05:48.765 --> 05:52.226
No. That was way too fast.
I'm not ready to say goodbye yet.

05:52.310 --> 05:56.773
[Nirmala] Then you don't have to.
Why don't you all come to my wedding?

05:57.357 --> 05:59.942
We could use
some more attractive young people.

06:00.443 --> 06:03.571
Who's your handsome friend?
Uh, what's his name? Carfax?

06:03.654 --> 06:05.990
-Paxton?
-Yes. Bring him too.

06:06.074 --> 06:08.743
I'd love to see his face
in my wedding album.

06:08.826 --> 06:10.787
Thank you so much, Pati.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.956
And I will see you bitches tomorrow.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.083
Devi, language.

06:15.917 --> 06:18.002
It's feminist to call a girl a bitch now.

06:18.503 --> 06:19.754
[pensive music playing]

06:19.837 --> 06:21.839
[McEnroe] Devi had wanted
to go to Princeton

06:21.923 --> 06:23.591
for the better part of her life,

06:23.674 --> 06:25.718
but the thought of packing this suitcase

06:25.802 --> 06:29.555
was making her break into a cold sweat,
and she had no idea why.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.266
Okay, what do we need? What do we need?

06:32.934 --> 06:34.352
Shoe.

06:34.435 --> 06:37.105
Yeah, I bet there'll be
some walking there.

06:38.356 --> 06:39.982
And maybe some school supplies…

06:41.067 --> 06:43.319
because it is a school.

06:47.573 --> 06:51.661
So it turns out we're a pretty good team
for two people who hate each other.

06:51.744 --> 06:52.954
I don't hate you.

06:53.037 --> 06:55.164
I just think you're pretentious
and unlikable.

06:55.248 --> 06:56.124
[chuckles]

06:57.208 --> 07:00.920
[McEnroe] Since their last conversation,
Devi had thought of Ben often,

07:01.003 --> 07:02.672
but had texted him little.

07:02.755 --> 07:06.968
She didn't wanna be the sad thirst bucket
who was pining after someone

07:07.051 --> 07:09.011
who'd already moved on with his life.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.931
But every now and then,
she couldn't help herself.

07:12.014 --> 07:13.057
Mmm.

07:13.683 --> 07:17.728
[inhales] Yeah, I got a good start there.
I'll hit it hard in the morning.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.981
[McEnroe] And speaking of hitting it hard
in the morning,

07:20.064 --> 07:21.816
it was 1 a.m. in New York,

07:21.899 --> 07:24.193
and Ben and the other interns
from his firm

07:24.277 --> 07:26.070
were at their favorite club,

07:26.154 --> 07:30.283
which incidentally, was the only club
that would accept their fake IDs.

07:30.366 --> 07:33.327
Thank you, sweetheart.
Hey, can you break this hundo for me?

07:33.411 --> 07:35.705
-[waitress] Sure. You got it.
-Keep five for yourself.

07:35.788 --> 07:39.375
[McEnroe] It was on nights like these,
that he thought about Devi the most.

you nuking someone tonight?

07:47.884 --> 07:51.095
[Devi] Nah, can't obliterate the Valley
before Pati's wedding. [chuckles]

07:51.596 --> 07:53.931
Too bad you're not here.
She invited all my friends.

07:54.515 --> 07:56.100
-[Ben] Oh, man, I wish I--
-The thing is--

07:56.184 --> 07:58.603
-Dude. Come on.
-I'm sorry, bro.

07:59.228 --> 08:01.731
Uh… Yo, look what I texted
that girl, Chelsea.

08:01.814 --> 08:04.734
-I'm being so rude to her.
-Wait, I thought you liked her.

08:04.817 --> 08:07.195
I do. But that's why I'm negging her.

08:07.278 --> 08:09.864
Aren't you worried that she'll move on
to someone who's nice to her?

08:09.947 --> 08:11.574
Nah. That's not how it works.

08:11.657 --> 08:14.118
Dude, trust me.
I know what I'm talking about.

08:14.202 --> 08:15.995
If you know what you're talking about,

08:16.078 --> 08:19.123
then why is it always just the four of us
every weekend with no girls in sight?

08:19.832 --> 08:22.668
Oh, all right, Mr. Friggin' Big Shot.

08:22.752 --> 08:25.296
Last girl you liked,
you just told her straight up?

08:25.379 --> 08:26.422
Well, I--

08:26.964 --> 08:27.798
Uh…

08:29.091 --> 08:31.010
No. No, I… I didn't.

08:31.093 --> 08:32.303
Because it sucks.

08:32.386 --> 08:35.139
No, it doesn't suck. It's just… scary.

this many jewels in my normal life.

welcome to my home-slash-tent.

09:52.258 --> 09:54.510
Oh, Devi, you can just call me Lindsay.

and I'm dating your friend.

looks like there's a really old bartender
and a really cool bartender.

10:13.070 --> 10:15.323
I think the really cool bartender
will serve us drinks.

10:15.406 --> 10:17.366
Nah, cool bartenders
are never cool people.

10:17.450 --> 10:20.703

Devi, how brave of you
to move 3,000 miles away

10:38.346 --> 10:40.890
from everything and everyone
you've ever known.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.933

So if you're going to college tomorrow,

10:45.853 --> 10:48.898

the last night of your childhood.

10:48.981 --> 10:50.733

10:54.570 --> 10:56.155
Who will comfort you?

10:56.238 --> 10:58.532
Not your family
because they're too far away.

Oh. Uh, he actually left already.

at some douchey law firm in New York City.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.146
That's too bad.

11:29.230 --> 11:33.192

What? No.

11:34.860 --> 11:35.945
Why would it?

11:36.028 --> 11:38.489
Uh, maybe because he showed up
at our house with flowers.

11:38.572 --> 11:40.491
Okay, yeah, dude, 'cause he was on drugs.

11:40.574 --> 11:43.369

when they're on drugs.

You should see me after I've had NyQuil.
It's like hot dick city.

Okay, yeah.
Well, I think it was just one weird night.

I'm pretty sure he just…
sees me as a friend.

11:51.877 --> 11:53.879
Okay, well, even as friends,

11:53.963 --> 11:55.881
he was dropping by unannounced
kind of a lot.

11:55.965 --> 11:57.466
And how many times can two people

everyone else down at the tent though?

one little toast just the three of us.

Although… would you guys think
I was a loser

13:02.281 --> 13:04.200
if I said I'm kind of scared to leave?

13:04.283 --> 13:06.535

-[Fabiola] Yeah.

13:08.287 --> 13:10.581
It's just… scary moving so far away.

Devi, I know that you've been ready
to go off to college since you were eight,

You are the bravest person we know.

13:23.427 --> 13:25.513
You're the reason
we did anything in high school.

13:25.596 --> 13:28.974
Without you, we'd still be eating lunch
in the teachers' lounge.

13:29.058 --> 13:31.560
And the only reason
we have our current lovers

13:31.644 --> 13:33.854
is because they were friends
with the smokeshows

13:33.938 --> 13:36.899
that you had the audacity to pursue.

13:36.982 --> 13:39.944

you're picking fights with her, right?

14:28.951 --> 14:30.619
Because you're scared that she's leaving.

14:30.703 --> 14:32.705
I used to do the same thing with Mohan.

14:32.788 --> 14:34.498
He'd be heading off to the airport,

14:34.582 --> 14:37.877

because his clothes were too wrinkled,

14:37.960 --> 14:39.128
