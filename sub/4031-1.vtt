They say that starting a family
is an act of optimism.

00:52.533 --> 00:57.368
Well, Tom and l were clearly
very, very, very optimistic.

00:57.453 --> 01:00.684
There are always good times
and difficult ones along the way.

01:00.773 --> 01:04.049
And with 12 kids, you learn a lot of lessons.

01:04.132 --> 01:08.923
But the one that you never get used to is that
moment when you look your child in the eye

01:09.013 --> 01:14.565
and find yourself having to say
the most difficult word of all: goodbye.

01:14.653 --> 01:17.326
All right, stay together.

01:32.093 --> 01:34.926
There she is.

01:35.013 --> 01:37.083
Sergio Archer.

01:38.653 --> 01:41.087
Look, she's right there.

01:42.813 --> 01:44.963
Robert Armstrong.

01:46.853 --> 01:48.525
Peter Bailey.

01:52.893 --> 01:55.965
Lorraine Baker.

02:18.133 --> 02:20.931
-- He's really gotten good.
-- Yeah.

02:24.253 --> 02:26.323
My gosh. Kicking, kicking.

02:45.693 --> 02:49.083
All right, all right.
lt is time to toast the graduate.

02:54.093 --> 02:56.084
Lorraine,

02:56.173 --> 02:58.323
we are all so proud of you,

02:58.413 --> 03:02.008
for keeping your chin up
and charging the mountain.

03:06.493 --> 03:10.168
And for being a truly unique
and wonderful person.

03:10.253 --> 03:15.407
And for getting that internship at Allure
magazine. Did you know about that?

03:16.773 --> 03:21.403
Even though l'll be trying to convince you
staying here is a better choice for your future

03:21.493 --> 03:27.204
than moving to dirty, expensive, crime--ridden
New York City, but here's to Lorraine.

03:28.693 --> 03:32.288
OK. My daughter Nora and her husband Bud,
you wanna say something?

03:32.373 --> 03:35.968
And our future linebacker.
We go. Let's go.

03:39.453 --> 03:42.047
First of all, congratulations, Lorraine.

03:42.133 --> 03:45.523
Bud and l hope that our baby
will be as cool and accomplished as you.

03:45.613 --> 03:50.368
And second of all, l don't mean
to make this toast all about Bud and l,

03:50.453 --> 03:54.526
-- but we have some kind of big news.
-- You know about this?

03:54.613 --> 03:59.607
l've just been offered the vice--presidency
of a new advertising firm.

03:59.693 --> 04:02.651
Hey! Congratulations. Yeah!

04:03.133 --> 04:05.124
ln Houston.

04:07.853 --> 04:11.482
We're moving in September. Thank you.

04:11.573 --> 04:13.564
Great. Wow.

04:17.053 --> 04:20.932
-- Does this mean we won't be uncles?
-- You'll be uncles no matter where we live.

04:21.012 --> 04:23.846
Maybe they thought
it was the best way to break it to us.

04:23.933 --> 04:27.403
-- Quite a surprise.
-- l'll say. Can l get a beer and a white wine?

04:27.493 --> 04:29.563
-- Hey, you guys.
-- Hey.

04:29.653 --> 04:33.168
-- l feel like l'm losing two daughters now.
-- You're not losing us.

04:33.253 --> 04:37.087
l hope you have help, cos with no family
there and you being a first--time mom...

04:37.173 --> 04:40.722
-- You'll be at work all day...
-- l'm not gonna be at work all the time.

04:40.813 --> 04:45.125
We're gonna be fine. And whatever house
we get is gonna have a room reserved for you.

04:45.213 --> 04:48.171
At least you're gonna stay
for the touch football game.

04:48.253 --> 04:51.529
-- We can't. We have Lamaze.
-- This will help your breathing.

04:51.613 --> 04:53.331
We're gonna see you soon.

04:53.413 --> 04:56.132
You're driving, right?

04:56.213 --> 04:59.330
-- See you.
-- Bye, sweetheart. There you go, sir.

04:59.853 --> 05:01.286
That's...

05:01.373 --> 05:03.364
They seem so casual and cavalier.

05:03.453 --> 05:06.365
Well, time for me to get my hands dirty.

05:06.453 --> 05:10.048
You're working? What about the game?
Rematch against the cousins.

05:10.133 --> 05:12.772
l've got student loans to pay off, Dad.

05:14.053 --> 05:16.851
-- OK. See you.
-- Be safe, honey.

05:16.933 --> 05:20.209
Did everybody forget touch football
was a tradition here?

05:20.293 --> 05:23.683
-- Honey, you've got ten other kids to draft.
-- l forgot.

05:23.773 --> 05:25.331
-- You forgot?
-- Lorraine.

05:26.213 --> 05:28.852
-- Staying for the game?
-- No, didn't Mom tell you?

05:28.933 --> 05:32.448
l'm spending the weekend at Beth's.
l leave in five minutes. Love you.

05:32.533 --> 05:35.127
Bye. Hey, guys. Ready for some touch?

05:35.213 --> 05:40.526
-- Mike and l are competing at the skate park.
-- l volunteered at the animal shelter.

05:43.493 --> 05:46.405
Nigel, Kyle, football.

05:46.933 --> 05:48.924
All right.

05:52.613 --> 05:56.572
-- l'm here, Coach.
-- You just made the varsity, little lady.

05:56.653 --> 05:59.247
Come on. There you go.
Go, go, go!

05:59.333 --> 06:01.847
-- l'll block for you. Here we go. Go!
-- Athletes!

06:03.973 --> 06:05.884
-- Are you OK?
-- Yeah.

06:06.893 --> 06:09.361
Somehow l thought it'd get easier.

06:09.453 --> 06:14.402
Ten minutes ago, they were all over us. Now
they don't want to be seen with us in public.

06:14.493 --> 06:18.486
-- What's that doing here?
-- l bet Lorraine was looking through this.

06:18.573 --> 06:20.564
That's sweet.

06:23.173 --> 06:25.641
The cutest. Look at her.

06:25.733 --> 06:28.293
She looks just like my mom.

06:28.373 --> 06:30.329
A lot of memories.

06:30.413 --> 06:32.608
Summers in Wisconsin.

06:32.693 --> 06:36.891
Swimming. All of us camping out.
Everyone together. lsn't that sweet?

06:36.973 --> 06:40.852
That had to be the last time we were there.
What was it? Three or four years ago?

06:40.933 --> 06:45.085
-- Look at Sarah. No teeth.
-- We were one tight unit back then.

06:45.173 --> 06:48.131
Even if we never beat the Murtaughs
for the Labor Day Cup.

06:48.213 --> 06:51.523
Look at that.
Jimmy Murtaugh -- Mr Competitive.

06:51.613 --> 06:55.572
He was so desperate to win,
he would... he would win.

06:55.653 --> 06:58.804
All the time.
Even when we were kids, this guy was...

06:58.893 --> 07:01.965
All right, honey. Let's not go there.

07:03.413 --> 07:06.962
You know what?
That's exactly what we should do.

07:07.053 --> 07:10.409
Go back to the lake. The whole family
on vacation, like we used to.

07:10.493 --> 07:13.485
l could call Mike Romanow
and see if the house is available.

07:13.573 --> 07:17.361
lt's a great idea, but the kids
are in summer school and Nora's pregnant.

07:17.453 --> 07:21.526
That's exactly why we should do it, Kate.
We said it. Life's blazing by.

07:21.613 --> 07:24.810
Let's go back to the lake one last time.

07:25.533 --> 07:28.047
We did have such good times there, honey.

07:28.133 --> 07:31.728
You and l had alone time, which was nice.

07:31.813 --> 07:33.804
There's the proof.

07:35.373 --> 07:37.933
-- Hey, Gunner.
-- Hey, Gunner.

07:38.013 --> 07:40.811
Let's call Mike Romanow, honey.

07:44.253 --> 07:46.767
You're conferencing
with all of us and Lorraine.

07:46.853 --> 07:49.731
-- Hi, Charlie.
-- Hey, guys. What's up?

07:49.813 --> 07:52.008
-- lt's Lorraine.
-- We have a surprise.

07:52.093 --> 07:54.402
We rented the big house up in Lake Winnetka.

07:54.493 --> 07:57.371
-- Winnetka? That's my middle name.
-- And Lake is mine.

07:57.453 --> 08:01.924
And it's where we're gonna spend Labor Day,
just like in the old days.

08:02.013 --> 08:04.447
Dad, l'm gonna be very pregnant then.

08:04.533 --> 08:07.730
And l'm gonna be apartment hunting
in New York in August.

08:07.813 --> 08:12.045
-- l wanna hang out with my friends.
-- How come we're named after a house?

08:12.133 --> 08:15.921
Good question. Your middle name is
Winnetka and your middle name is Lake

08:16.013 --> 08:19.005
-- cos you were conceived there.
-- What does ''conceived'' mean?

08:19.093 --> 08:23.689
-- lt means Mom and Dad...
-- Had a conversation that we'd discuss it later.

08:23.773 --> 08:26.731
Kyle and me will go anyplace
that has our name on it.

08:26.813 --> 08:29.373
-- Bingo! Come on.
-- Yeah. l love the lake. l'm in.

08:29.453 --> 08:32.445
-- l guess l can cancel a couple of gigs.
-- Bingo!

08:32.533 --> 08:33.932
-- OK, we're in.
-- All right.

08:34.013 --> 08:36.004
We agree to participate.

08:36.092 --> 08:38.687
We'll bring the wakeboards
and totally dominate.

08:38.773 --> 08:42.890
-- OK, we're in.
-- All right! And that leaves Lorraine.

08:42.972 --> 08:46.488
-- Come on. You'll have fun.
-- Come on, Lorraine. Just come.

08:46.573 --> 08:49.246
All right, here's the deal. l'll go to the lake

08:49.333 --> 08:52.131
if Dad stops nagging me
about not going to New York.

08:52.213 --> 08:54.727
Deal. That's a dozen. We're going to the lake.

09:17.213 --> 09:21.001
-- Who cut the cheese?
-- Gunner farted.

09:21.733 --> 09:24.725
We'll drive up tomorrow
or the next day.

09:24.813 --> 09:27.885
-- You missed.
-- l love you too. Bye.

09:27.973 --> 09:31.852
Lorraine's got a line on a place.
She and Charlie will come in a couple of days.

09:31.933 --> 09:36.324
Couple of days? The whole point of the
vacation is that the whole family is together.

09:36.413 --> 09:38.404
Honey, relax.

09:40.493 --> 09:44.122
All right. Remember this?
Look at the lake. lt looks fantastic.

09:44.213 --> 09:47.046
-- Does it look great or what?
-- Come on, kids.

09:47.133 --> 09:49.727
All right. Slide out. Hurry up.

09:51.453 --> 09:54.684
Everyone out. Come on.
Let's check the place out.

09:54.773 --> 09:56.809
-- Look at it.
-- This is it?

09:56.893 --> 09:59.965
-- Remember this?
-- lt looks smaller.

10:00.053 --> 10:03.523
-- And more disgusting.
-- Yeah. Why can't we rent that place?

10:03.613 --> 10:06.446
Well, that place is new.

10:06.533 --> 10:10.606
-- This place is...
-- Older, but still nice.

10:10.693 --> 10:16.450
Yeah. And that might have a water slide,
but our place has...

10:16.533 --> 10:18.649
There's stairs. They're fun.

10:18.733 --> 10:22.521
So unload, camper dudes! Girls in
the north bunk room, boys in the south.

10:22.613 --> 10:25.002
-- Bud and Nora in the loft. Come on!
-- Careful.

10:25.093 --> 10:28.165
Hey, Bud, give the phone a rest.
We're on vacation.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.562
Hey. How did Mad Dog like the trip?

10:30.653 --> 10:33.213
Maybe the baby's
not gonna be a ''Mad Dog'', Tom.

10:33.293 --> 10:37.491
But that's a classic linebacker name.
OK, how about Dick Butkus McNulty?

10:37.573 --> 10:41.248
-- Maybe it's gonna be a girl, Dad.
-- Donna Butkus McNulty.

10:41.333 --> 10:44.530
-- We got all vacation to pick a name.
-- Someone's here.

10:44.613 --> 10:47.286
-- Mike Romanow. Good to see you.
-- Good to see you.

10:47.373 --> 10:51.127
Everything OK? Shouldn't be too
disorganised, only two renters this season.

10:51.213 --> 10:54.683
-- The lake's a lot more upscale.
-- Thank Jimmy Murtaugh. Remember him?

10:54.773 --> 10:56.923
-- Yeah.
-- He owns most of the lake now.

10:57.013 --> 10:59.083
That's his place over there.

10:59.613 --> 11:01.524
Well, good for Jimmy.

11:02.213 --> 11:05.728
-- Hey, remember Kate?
-- Hey, Mike. How are you?

11:05.813 --> 11:07.485
-- Good to see you.
-- Good to see you.

11:07.573 --> 11:10.883
lf you don't feel like cooking,
there's a clambake up at the club.

11:10.973 --> 11:13.009
-- You can come as my guests.
-- Guests?

11:13.093 --> 11:16.642
Yeah. Club's private now.
And renovated.

11:16.733 --> 11:20.089
-- Homeowners only. Put you on the list?
-- OK.

11:24.253 --> 11:26.244
-- What's going on?
-- Stop!

11:27.333 --> 11:29.847
The Chiseller.

11:29.933 --> 11:33.130
-- Tell me those aren't my keys.
-- Get him outside, OK?

11:33.213 --> 11:37.445
-- l remember how to handle this guy.
-- l can't believe he's still alive.

11:37.533 --> 11:40.525
-- You know that thing?
-- Hey.

11:41.093 --> 11:43.448
-- Don't hurt him.
-- l got it. l got it.

11:43.533 --> 11:47.367
lt's a snap. Here you go. Hold still. Yeah.

11:53.853 --> 11:56.208
Leave him alone!

11:56.293 --> 11:58.682
Gunner! Stay! Stay, Gunner!

11:58.773 --> 12:01.287
-- Get him.
-- Gunner, stay!

12:03.013 --> 12:04.890
Mom, watch out!

12:12.053 --> 12:14.487
Don't light the fireworks.

12:16.373 --> 12:19.683
-- No explosives in the house!
-- Nigel! Kyle!

12:25.893 --> 12:27.485
Gunner, come back.

12:32.613 --> 12:35.173
-- What was that beast?
-- The Chiseller?

12:35.253 --> 12:37.369
A pack rat. Steals stuff and hides it.

12:37.453 --> 12:40.331
-- l'll get a trap in the morning.
-- A humane trap, right?

12:40.413 --> 12:43.007
You know what?
We got a fantastic first day going.

12:43.093 --> 12:48.850
So let's clean up and unpack,
cos we got a clambake to go to! Clambake!

12:49.173 --> 12:52.927
-- OK, here we go. What is all this stuff?
-- l'm going as fast as l can.

12:53.013 --> 12:55.811
l should put more sugar in your diets,
get you moving.

12:55.893 --> 12:57.849
You actually bought that shirt?

12:57.933 --> 13:03.803
Every dad is entitled to one hideous shirt and
one horrible sweater. lt's part of the dad code.

13:03.893 --> 13:07.647
-- Mark, you're on fireworks detail.
-- OK.

13:07.733 --> 13:10.645
-- What's all that?
-- Nothing.

13:10.733 --> 13:12.166
Seatbelts.

13:13.373 --> 13:16.285
OK, kids. You know the rules.

13:19.093 --> 13:23.291
l'm underdressed. l thought this
was supposed to be a clambake.

13:23.373 --> 13:25.568
Excuse me. l'll be right back.

13:25.653 --> 13:28.565
-- Hey, guys. So glad you could come.
-- Hi, Mike.

13:28.653 --> 13:31.690
Good to see you.
Listen. Kids, food's downstairs.

13:31.773 --> 13:34.207
Mom, Dad, the bar is there.
Have a great time.

13:34.293 --> 13:37.091
-- Best behaviour.
-- Stick together. Keep an eye on them.

13:37.173 --> 13:39.164
-- Food.
-- See you later.

13:45.813 --> 13:48.486
-- Lloyd, how are you?
-- Good to see you, Jimmy.

13:48.573 --> 13:51.212
There's Jimmy Murtaugh!
Engage me in conversation.

13:51.293 --> 13:56.128
-- We are talking.
-- l know, but more intense so he won't come.

13:57.253 --> 14:02.088
-- Just hide your face.
-- Well, that's a little obvious.

14:02.173 --> 14:04.050
-- Tom!
-- Turn.

14:04.133 --> 14:08.843
My goodness.
Look what the wind blew in.

14:08.933 --> 14:10.969
-- Hey!
-- Jimmy!

14:12.013 --> 14:15.130
-- Tom. Look at you.
-- How are you?

14:15.213 --> 14:21.083
Wow, you're looking good. A little wrinkled
around the edges, but not bad for an old man.

14:21.173 --> 14:23.733
-- And you.
-- Kate.

14:23.813 --> 14:28.364
Kate. Still looking very hot for a mother of 12.

14:28.453 --> 14:32.082
-- What brings you guys back to my lake?
-- Your lake? Your lake now?

14:32.173 --> 14:36.610
Well, you know, l just have to buy Romanow's
place and one or two other properties.

14:36.693 --> 14:41.005
And then l can keep
the riff--raff like you outta here.

14:41.973 --> 14:45.682
l'm sorry, honey.
Tom and Kate, this is Sarina, my new bride.

14:45.773 --> 14:48.128
-- Nice to meet you, Sarina.
-- Nice to meet you.

14:48.213 --> 14:51.330
The parents of that family of pranksters
l told you about.

14:51.413 --> 14:56.009
Jimmy's always been jealous cos we have 12
kids and he only has eight. A manhood thing.

14:56.093 --> 15:00.484
Well, your 12 never beat my eight
for the cup, now, did they, Tom?

15:00.573 --> 15:03.246
-- Well, no, they didn't.
-- ls that why you came back?

15:03.333 --> 15:08.532
-- Trying to knock my family off the wall?
-- No. We actually just came for a vacation.

15:08.613 --> 15:11.844
-- Come on. Buy me a drink.
-- Buy you a drink? Mr Lake?

15:14.333 --> 15:17.564
Jake Baker? Eliot Murtaugh.

15:17.653 --> 15:20.213
No way. Dude, it's Eliot Murtaugh.

15:22.373 --> 15:24.409
-- That's Mike.
-- Hey, Mike.

15:24.493 --> 15:27.212
That's such a cool stick.
Can you bang any tricks?

15:27.293 --> 15:29.682
Yeah. Check it.

15:31.813 --> 15:33.804
Awesome!

15:38.333 --> 15:41.484
-- l'll have clams, please.
-- Sorry, there's no clams.

15:41.573 --> 15:43.928
We have some clam fritters.

15:44.013 --> 15:47.892
So this clambake is clamless?
Then why notjust call it a buffet?

15:47.973 --> 15:52.285
-- l feel like a stranger on this planet.
-- l couldn't agree with you more.

15:53.293 --> 15:58.686
So, Tom, l read you quit the head coaching
gig at lllinois Poly. What was that all about?

15:58.773 --> 16:02.243
lt took up a lot of hours and l wanted
to spend more time with the family.

16:02.333 --> 16:04.130
-- Kudos.
-- Thank you.

16:04.213 --> 16:07.444
-- That's my word for the day.
-- How fun. lt's fun to have a word.

16:07.533 --> 16:12.561
So, Katie, l guess with Tom at home changing
diapers, you're tearing up the bestseller list.

16:12.653 --> 16:15.213
l only had the one book,
but l would love to...

16:15.293 --> 16:19.923
Excuse me. Waiter.
Another Scotch, por favor. Anybody else?

16:20.013 --> 16:23.050
-- l'm fine.
-- Hey, what about Charlie? Still playing ball?

16:23.133 --> 16:26.205
No. He's living downtown
and he's working in a garage

16:26.293 --> 16:28.648
to pay tuition
to the University of Chicago.

16:28.733 --> 16:32.169
l did a guest spot on Monster Garage
back when l was acting.

16:32.253 --> 16:35.643
And l just love
the whole engine--and--cars thing.

16:35.733 --> 16:38.770
-- So you're an actress. That's great.
-- Thank you, Tom.

16:38.853 --> 16:41.686
-- You're welcome, Sarina.
-- Kudos.

16:44.133 --> 16:48.285
-- How long have you two been married?
-- Six amazing months.

16:48.373 --> 16:51.285
-- Right, honey?
-- Happy anniversary.

16:51.373 --> 16:55.651
There's Mike, Jake and Sarah. They compete
in skating contests on a regular basis.

16:55.733 --> 16:58.645
-- See you.
-- Hey! Sarah!

16:58.733 --> 17:04.046
That's good. You gotta start with
the small steps before you take the big ones.

17:05.492 --> 17:07.643
-- Mark Baker?
-- Kenny the maniac!

17:07.733 --> 17:10.122
Well, if it isn't my partner in crime.

17:10.213 --> 17:13.967
-- You're gonna get in trouble, Murtaugh.
-- Only if l get caught, Baker.

17:14.053 --> 17:17.011
Come here. l wanna show you something.

17:17.093 --> 17:21.132
-- Please don't get me in trouble like last time.
-- You worry too much.

17:21.213 --> 17:22.692
How are your kids?

17:22.772 --> 17:26.402
l've got three at a private school
for gifted children in Lake Forest.

17:26.492 --> 17:28.529
Two at Andover, one at Exeter.

17:28.613 --> 17:34.051
Calvin's at Yale finishing up a field study in
particle physics. Generating a lot of interest.

17:34.133 --> 17:38.251
Eliot was in Sports lllustrated.
Just won the snowboarding junior nationals.

17:38.333 --> 17:41.131
-- Slope style.
-- Well, that was no surprise.

17:41.213 --> 17:43.773
But l gotta say, Anne's still my superstar.

17:43.853 --> 17:48.608
When she finishes her MBA at Harvard, she's
gonna work for me at Murtaugh Enterprises.

17:48.693 --> 17:50.604
Definitely corporate material.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.533
Something reeks.

18:10.093 --> 18:12.129
Get out of the way!

18:15.373 --> 18:18.649
Watch out! Watch out! Watch out!

18:24.573 --> 18:26.529
Look out. She's gonna blow!

18:48.853 --> 18:50.366
Cool.

18:50.453 --> 18:54.128
Listen, mister, accident or not,
you'll be taking the garbage out,

18:54.213 --> 18:56.408
or something you don't wanna do,
for 30 days.

18:56.493 --> 18:59.963
So sit down, please. Everyone, quiet. For me.

19:00.053 --> 19:04.968
Parenting comes down to one word -- ''push''.
lf you don't push, they don't do anything.

19:05.053 --> 19:09.490
-- l think it's a little more complicated.
-- ls it?

19:09.573 --> 19:14.283
''Most went through periods in their life when
they worried about making car payments.''

19:14.373 --> 19:17.092
-- Hey! Gotcha!
-- Yeah.

19:17.173 --> 19:19.971
Nigel, leave Kyle's pants alone!

19:20.853 --> 19:23.606
Look, no one was hurt. lt's fine.

19:23.693 --> 19:26.765
ln fact, why don't you come over
to The Boulders sometime?

19:26.853 --> 19:28.969
-- The Boulders?
-- Our cottage.

19:29.053 --> 19:31.089
We would love to do that sometime...

19:31.173 --> 19:35.724
Hey, kids, why don't you leave the fireworks
at home? You're all welcome at our place.

19:35.813 --> 19:38.805
We've got Seadoos, lasers, wireless internet,

19:38.893 --> 19:43.489
plasma screens, satellite TVs,
all the toys and whistles.

19:43.573 --> 19:47.009
You know what? Actually, we're here
for quality time with the kids.

19:47.093 --> 19:50.165
Come on, it's time to go.
We've done enough damage here.

19:50.253 --> 19:53.723
-- So we'll probably see you on the lake.
-- Sure. Another time.

19:53.813 --> 19:56.850
-- Nice to meet you.
-- Nice meeting you too.

19:56.933 --> 20:00.243
Good seeing you again, Tom.
You too...

20:00.333 --> 20:02.324
-- Kate.
-- Kate.

20:04.773 --> 20:09.130
Boy, you know, when we were kids,
l used to be so envious of Tom Baker.

20:09.213 --> 20:11.408
He just had it all.

20:11.493 --> 20:17.090
Well, l guess the Gucci loafer's
on the other foot now, isn't it?

20:17.893 --> 20:20.805
-- Everyone, straight to bed.
-- What a moron.

20:20.893 --> 20:23.088
-- He's our son.
-- Not Mark, he's a kid.

20:23.173 --> 20:25.971
Murtaugh. ''Seems like you
could use the word 'push'.''

20:26.053 --> 20:28.647
Next time we see him,
let's agree to ignore him.

20:28.733 --> 20:32.772
-- There's not gonna be a next time.
-- l don't know if the kids will agree.

20:32.853 --> 20:36.846
You think that water slide could compete
with the tyre swing l'm gonna put up?

20:37.173 --> 20:39.926
Rise and shine! Daylight's burning.

20:40.013 --> 20:42.368
lt is breakfast at the Bakers', day one!

20:42.453 --> 20:44.842
Come on, sleepy heads.

20:44.933 --> 20:49.006
ls there a particular reason
that we're eating breakfast outside?

20:49.093 --> 20:54.087
-- Cos it's a beautiful day at Lake Winnetka.
-- lt's vacation, sweetheart.

20:54.173 --> 20:59.486
And there's the rest of the clan. Come on.
Hey, guys. Hey, guys, look.

20:59.573 --> 21:02.292
Hey! Welcome to the land o' plenty.

21:02.373 --> 21:08.846
lt still smells the same here. Like dead leaves,
unwashed animals and murky lake water.

21:08.933 --> 21:11.686
-- lt's called fresh air, sweetheart.
-- Watch the hat.

21:11.773 --> 21:13.525
-- Hey, guys.
-- Come on, let's eat.

21:13.613 --> 21:17.083
We're gonna need a forklift
to get Lorraine's suitcase outta here.

21:17.173 --> 21:20.768
What have l been here, 30 seconds,
and you're already making fun of me?

21:20.853 --> 21:23.242
Yeah, that was my foot.

21:24.133 --> 21:27.728
-- ls that suitcase just for make--up?
-- Whatever, Butch.

21:27.813 --> 21:31.692
Big breakfast, everybody, so you
have enough room for family activities.

21:31.773 --> 21:36.005
-- Family activities?
-- Appleschmear. Fishing for Big Daddy.

21:36.093 --> 21:38.243
The tyre swing, the diving board.

21:38.333 --> 21:40.688
-- l'm boarding.
-- Kenneth has video games.

21:40.773 --> 21:45.369
We were gonna use the Murtaughs' internet
to research for the academic decathlon.

21:45.453 --> 21:47.648
Precisely. We need the extra hours.

21:47.733 --> 21:50.486
Well, you got all vacation
to go over to that place.

21:50.573 --> 21:53.610
We have all vacation
to do the family activities too.

21:53.693 --> 21:56.412
Sarah, what about you?
You wanna hang out with Dad?

21:56.493 --> 22:00.168
Actually, l was gonna go boarding with Jake.

22:00.253 --> 22:02.767
And Eliot.

22:03.773 --> 22:06.845
Well, you know, l guess
we could do lake stuff another day.

22:06.933 --> 22:09.606
Here we go. Scones.

22:09.693 --> 22:13.925
Henry. Jake.
All right. Leave it there, the dog will get it.

22:48.333 --> 22:50.972
Did you nail down an apartment?

22:51.053 --> 22:53.169
l'm just waiting to hear.

22:53.253 --> 22:56.882
l'll bet you could
get a place in Chicago for half the rent.

22:56.973 --> 22:59.362
Dad, l thought we made a deal.

23:00.573 --> 23:02.564
That dock needs work.

23:13.533 --> 23:16.923
-- Where are you going?
-- The hardware store. l'll fix this place up.

23:17.013 --> 23:19.607
-- You got a crazy look. What are you getting?
-- Tools!

23:45.053 --> 23:47.169
Honey.

23:47.373 --> 23:49.841
Honey.

23:49.933 --> 23:52.367
OK. Do not stand up. Do you hear me?

23:52.453 --> 23:55.047
Dad! Dad! Hello?

23:56.373 --> 23:58.170
Dad!

24:01.093 --> 24:03.527
Hey, kids. Tyre swing ready!

24:07.213 --> 24:09.204
Tyre swing not ready.

24:46.293 --> 24:49.126
-- Hey, Dad.
-- Hey. Get bored over at the Murtaughs'?

24:49.213 --> 24:51.443
No. We're going back after study time.

24:51.533 --> 24:54.923
You guys are making time for your studies?
l'm really proud of you.

24:55.013 --> 24:56.765
Not us, Dad. Them.

24:56.853 --> 25:00.766
Mr Murtaugh forces all of the kids
to read and write two hours every day.

25:00.853 --> 25:03.242
Lame. l know.

25:05.973 --> 25:07.804
Who are these guys?

25:08.773 --> 25:11.287
-- What?
-- There's no way l'm camping out.

25:11.373 --> 25:15.332
Yes, honey.
You can do it one night for Daddy. Come on.

25:15.413 --> 25:18.371
-- This doesn't sit well with me.
-- l know what you mean.

25:18.453 --> 25:22.731
Lorraine, are you serious?
ls she kidding?

25:23.693 --> 25:26.765
That's not gonna fit in your tent, Lorraine.

25:26.853 --> 25:29.242
l'm gonna make it fit, Dad.

25:34.933 --> 25:37.845
-- Hey, come on. We're making s'mores.
-- l'll help you.

25:37.933 --> 25:41.050
Actually, we're trying
to eat only organic food.

25:41.133 --> 25:44.762
-- We're trying to eat only organic food.
-- ls that for the baby?

25:44.853 --> 25:47.811
Come on. Baby'll love a s'more.
Party in your tummy.

25:47.893 --> 25:53.445
Cool. The Bakers are having a campout.
Can l go over?

25:53.533 --> 25:57.890
Why have a campout when you can have
a full--on fondue party right here?

25:57.973 --> 25:59.565
Sweet.

25:59.653 --> 26:02.645
Charlie, you're worse than a kitten.

26:10.813 --> 26:13.611
Babe, that's your fourth s'more.

26:13.693 --> 26:17.606
My parents never let me have these.
They're amazing.

26:23.413 --> 26:26.211
Do you think we should be
more strict with the kids?

26:26.293 --> 26:32.050
No, honey. We give them love and guidance.
What else is there, really?

26:32.133 --> 26:35.330
Every time we turn around,
they're in trouble, about to get into it,

26:35.413 --> 26:37.768
or laying out a long--term plan to create it.

26:37.853 --> 26:41.846
Dad, how come those guys
know how to camp so good?

26:50.893 --> 26:54.886
-- Hey. Hey! What if we sing a camp song?
-- OK. Sounds good.

27:08.613 --> 27:11.002
What do you say we give 'em
a run for their money?

27:33.773 --> 27:35.331
Come on. Stand up.

27:55.933 --> 27:58.686
This guy is so competitive!

28:13.933 --> 28:16.527
Boy, l love camping.

28:16.613 --> 28:18.604
Yeah. This is fun.

28:20.333 --> 28:24.008
-- Good times. Good times.
-- Good times, yeah.

28:24.093 --> 28:28.962
Hey, kids. Didn't you love
blowing Murtaugh off the lake last night?

28:29.053 --> 28:30.964
Kids?

28:31.053 --> 28:33.169
Honey, they're all in the house.

28:33.253 --> 28:35.209
-- No.
-- Yeah.

28:41.653 --> 28:43.928
Hello?

28:44.013 --> 28:45.844
Happy?

28:45.933 --> 28:48.322
They can't spend one night in the tent?

28:48.413 --> 28:50.165
Hey, Tom.

28:55.053 --> 28:57.487
Now, what does that show--off want?

28:58.093 --> 29:00.084
What a day. Hey, Tom?

29:00.173 --> 29:03.449
Boy, you have got this place looking...

29:04.653 --> 29:09.443
Anyway, l see the troops are sleeping in.

29:09.533 --> 29:13.048
They're already up.
They're out cutting wood and making biscuits

29:13.133 --> 29:16.364
and blazing a new trail out back --
nothing out of the ordinary.

29:16.453 --> 29:21.368
Yeah. Really impressive. Listen, the missus
and l are thinking of putting on a little spread.

29:21.453 --> 29:23.603
Since the kids are getting along so well,

29:23.693 --> 29:26.651
why don't you and the gang
come to The Boulders for brunch?

29:26.733 --> 29:29.486
-- Actually, we have to...
-- Cool, what time?

29:29.573 --> 29:32.246
Mimosas at noon, on the dot.

29:32.333 --> 29:34.722
Yeah!

29:39.373 --> 29:41.443
Attagirl.

29:41.533 --> 29:43.922
Take it away, honey.

29:51.533 --> 29:53.364
Adios, amigo.

29:54.413 --> 29:58.372
-- lsn't he like the coolest dad ever?
-- Yeah. Cool.

30:07.213 --> 30:09.204
Whoa, dude!

30:12.133 --> 30:14.124
Awesome, dude.

30:18.773 --> 30:21.731
Kids, you stay right here.

30:24.373 --> 30:26.489
Welcome to The Boulders.

30:28.693 --> 30:30.888
-- Hey. Let's say hello.
-- Hi.

30:30.973 --> 30:35.285
Hey. Thanks for having us.
Where's the gift shop?

30:35.373 --> 30:38.251
You brought your dog.

30:38.333 --> 30:41.530
-- Sorry. Just say ''sit''.
-- Down, Gunner.

30:43.493 --> 30:45.723
Tom. Baker!

30:49.813 --> 30:51.804
Somebody help.

30:54.733 --> 30:57.850
-- l'm fine.
-- They're called obedience schools, Baker!

30:57.933 --> 30:59.730
-- Are you all right?
-- l'm fine.

30:59.813 --> 31:03.647
-- Tie Fido up for five minutes.
-- Honey, he's fine. Just let him play.

31:03.733 --> 31:08.329
We don't want that animal near the dining set.
lt was a gift from the king of Thailand.

31:08.413 --> 31:11.246
Mark, there's a leash in the car. Get it.

31:11.333 --> 31:13.528
-- Why don't we all go inside?
-- Good idea.

31:13.613 --> 31:15.251
l'll be right back.

31:15.333 --> 31:18.803
Sarah. You wanna go on the Seadoo
with me and Jake before we eat?

31:18.893 --> 31:21.043
Yeah. Sure.

31:21.133 --> 31:23.124
Cool. Let's go.

31:28.093 --> 31:30.812
Are you coming or not, dude?

31:30.893 --> 31:32.485
Yeah.

31:33.573 --> 31:35.689
Jimmy. Almost forgot.

31:35.773 --> 31:39.812
Tom, for heaven's sake.
You didn't have to do this.

31:39.893 --> 31:42.771
-- ''Sparkling Cheesehead''?
-- Wisconsin's finest bubbly.

31:42.853 --> 31:49.042
l'm sure it is. Might have to let this baby
age about two, three hundred years, Tom.

31:50.533 --> 31:54.685
Superstar, do me a favour. Take this to
the cellar and bring a bottle of Taittinger.

31:54.773 --> 31:57.924
-- Sure.
-- l'll give you a hand.

31:58.013 --> 32:02.291
-- lt's a fantastic place.
-- lt's not much, but l call it a second home.

32:04.453 --> 32:07.684
How come you guys
haven't built your own house up here?

32:07.773 --> 32:11.243
With 12 kids, you've gotta use the money
for food and water.

32:11.333 --> 32:15.770
l bet if Tom had kept thatjob at lllinois Poly
he could have built a place like this.

32:15.853 --> 32:19.562
Well, life's full of choices.
Some good, some not so good.

32:19.653 --> 32:24.169
Honey, why don't you take Kate and show her
the dining set the king of Thailand gave us?

32:24.253 --> 32:28.166
-- OK, honey.
-- l'd love to look at the plates from a king.

32:28.253 --> 32:32.610
-- Don't get lost, honey.
-- Tom, l wanna show you something.

32:32.693 --> 32:34.729
Feast your eyes on these honeys, Tom.

32:34.813 --> 32:38.692
Albino ironwood,
right out of the Peruvian rainforest.

32:38.773 --> 32:42.846
You can still smell the jungle on 'em.
Go ahead, take a whiff.

32:42.933 --> 32:47.643
Come on. Rest your honker
on the log and take a whiff.

32:47.733 --> 32:52.170
-- Smells like global warming.
-- That's moss. lt's moss, Tom.

32:52.253 --> 32:55.051
Well, this is the trophy room.

32:57.173 --> 33:01.724
-- Are those your kids?
-- Yeah. That's the Murtaugh victory reel.

33:01.813 --> 33:05.408
-- lt's on a loop.
-- lt's a good room.

33:05.493 --> 33:09.406
l'll tell you why
l love this room so much, Tom.

33:09.493 --> 33:14.408
All the trophies, the ribbons,
the prizes -- past, present and future.

33:14.493 --> 33:16.768
lt's proof that children can be groomed

33:16.853 --> 33:20.243
to reflect the best aspects
of any given gene pool.

33:20.333 --> 33:25.168
-- You just have to keep them on a short leash.
-- l couldn't agree more.

33:25.253 --> 33:27.721
My Anne's proof of that.

33:27.813 --> 33:30.964
You're looking a lot more put together
than you did a few years ago.

33:31.053 --> 33:32.406
Thanks.

33:32.493 --> 33:36.088
Remember your nose was too big,
and that skin irritation on your hand?

33:36.173 --> 33:40.166
ltjust kept working its way
up your arm and into your neck...

33:40.813 --> 33:44.601
l'm glad that it's gone, though. Looks good.

33:44.693 --> 33:49.608
Well, if l remember correctly,
you weren't so hot yourself.

33:54.973 --> 33:58.249
That mutt could use a shorter leash too.

34:03.213 --> 34:05.204
She's so cool.

34:06.933 --> 34:10.641
Yeah, the kids and l spent a weekend
putting that dock together.

34:10.733 --> 34:14.692
Nothing like a little manual labour
to keep you humble. Sit down, Tom.

34:14.773 --> 34:18.607
So Jimmy has matching pants to that shirt?

34:18.693 --> 34:21.685
Boy, this place wasn't put together overnight.

34:21.773 --> 34:24.492
-- Does Daddy know about your tattoo?
-- No.

34:26.253 --> 34:28.847
-- l'm sorry, Mom.
-- l'm so sorry.

34:28.933 --> 34:30.685
lt's OK. l'm fine.

34:32.572 --> 34:36.360
-- lt's like spring break. Hope l win.
-- l've got a shirt you can borrow.

34:36.453 --> 34:38.683
-- A shirt? OK.
-- Mom, l...

34:40.053 --> 34:42.931
-- Are you OK?
-- Yeah, l'm fine.

34:43.013 --> 34:45.846
-- lf my dad finds out before l...
-- You'll get grounded?

34:45.933 --> 34:48.731
Please, just don't say anything.

34:54.053 --> 34:56.043
Nice hands.

35:06.893 --> 35:08.724
-- Hey, Sarah.
-- Hey, Dad.

35:08.813 --> 35:11.281
You should see Mr Murtaugh's new Seadoo.

35:11.373 --> 35:16.811
That's terrific. Now turn around
and pretend to be looking at the view.

35:16.893 --> 35:18.212
Why?

35:18.293 --> 35:22.923
Turn around and pretend
to be looking at the view.

35:23.013 --> 35:26.688
Are you still in touch with your dark gifts?

35:26.773 --> 35:30.732
Punking, practical jokes,
soaking underwear and...

35:30.813 --> 35:32.883
-- Meat.
-- Yeah.

35:32.973 --> 35:34.884
-- Classic.
-- Yeah.

35:34.973 --> 35:39.967
-- Yeah, l'm in touch. Why?
-- l have a mission for you.

35:40.053 --> 35:42.169
Who's the target?

35:42.253 --> 35:44.244
Murtaugh.

35:45.453 --> 35:48.411
l can help you. Hi.

35:48.493 --> 35:52.406
-- As long as l don't do time for the crime.
-- Hey, guys. Hi.

35:52.493 --> 35:54.051
Done.

35:54.133 --> 35:57.364
No grounding. No allowance dockage.

35:57.453 --> 36:00.445
No spiel about the difference
between right and wrong.

36:00.533 --> 36:03.570
And you have no problem
with the methods that l choose.

36:03.653 --> 36:07.248
lt's your contract, do with it what you will.

36:07.333 --> 36:10.291
-- Agreed?
-- Agreed.

36:10.373 --> 36:13.922
Hey, give Daddy a hug. Nail him.

36:14.013 --> 36:17.528
Guys, guys. Guys! l have a mission for you.

36:17.613 --> 36:20.889
-- lt's top--secret, and it's high--priority.
-- Yeah? What is it?

36:20.973 --> 36:23.282
Come on. l'll show you.

36:38.733 --> 36:40.724
-- Positions.
-- Check.

36:52.613 --> 36:55.605
My gosh. lt's a purple bigfoot.

36:55.693 --> 36:58.491
-- What are you talking about?
-- A purple bigfoot!

36:58.573 --> 37:00.803
-- A what?
-- l don't see anything.

37:00.893 --> 37:03.202
Made you look, made you look.

37:03.293 --> 37:05.602
-- Made you look.
-- You are so stupid.

37:05.693 --> 37:11.609
-- Did l mention the dining set was a gift...?
-- The king of Thailand. Yeah, you did.

37:11.693 --> 37:15.208
-- Give me that roll.
-- l see your kids can't wait to get started.

37:15.293 --> 37:19.047
Well, that's just the way they are.

37:21.173 --> 37:25.166
Hey, you guys.
No eating until everyone's seated.

37:28.013 --> 37:31.210
-- Eyes up here, honey.
-- Doesn't she look hot?

37:37.853 --> 37:43.246
Doesn't hold a candle to you, honey.
Come on, let's sit down.

37:43.333 --> 37:46.405
-- Where have you been all my life?
-- All right.

37:46.493 --> 37:49.246
-- Tom, right over here.
-- Thank you.

37:49.333 --> 37:51.722
lgnore the place card.
Sit next to your wife.

37:51.813 --> 37:54.646
Fine. Fine, if you want chaos.
Right here, Tom.

37:54.733 --> 37:56.928
Believe me, l don't mind.

37:57.013 --> 37:59.925
Dad. Don't...

38:00.013 --> 38:01.890
The seat cushion is soft.

38:01.973 --> 38:04.441
-- So, you two play tennis?
-- Yeah.

38:04.533 --> 38:06.808
-- You're in the meat seat.
-- What?

38:21.293 --> 38:23.853
l knew that dog was gonna be trouble.

38:30.213 --> 38:31.931
Sit!

38:36.893 --> 38:38.884
My china.

38:43.173 --> 38:46.245
-- Where is he?
-- l don't know.

38:46.333 --> 38:48.005
You don't know?

38:59.533 --> 39:02.001
lt's OK. lt happens all the time.

39:02.093 --> 39:06.291
lt doesn't. l'm so sorry. l'm really
embarrassed. Thank you for the lovely shirt.

39:06.373 --> 39:08.648
l insist that you send me a bill for this.

39:08.733 --> 39:12.521
Don't even think about it.
What's a few thousand dollars here or there?

39:12.613 --> 39:15.081
The main thing is you had a good time.

39:15.173 --> 39:18.290
We'll talk about it later.
l'll see you on the tennis court.

39:18.373 --> 39:20.364
Bring your A game.

39:21.373 --> 39:23.967
-- Bye.
-- What was that?

39:24.053 --> 39:25.850
-- Nothing.
-- That was not nothing.

39:25.933 --> 39:29.642
This was not nothing. That was something.
All right. ln the house.

39:30.613 --> 39:32.205
l know. l'm a horrible father.

39:32.293 --> 39:35.490
-- Honey, you broke your promise.
-- What promise?

39:35.573 --> 39:38.645
That you'd not get involved
in this competitive thing.

39:38.733 --> 39:40.485
lt's just all so infantile.

39:40.573 --> 39:43.371
-- He tried to tell us how to raise the kids.
-- Meaning?

39:43.453 --> 39:45.808
-- He thinks the kids are...
-- Did he say it?

39:45.893 --> 39:50.842
No, but you could tell that he implied
that's what he thought, that the kids were...

39:51.773 --> 39:52.888
That's right.

39:55.813 --> 40:00.648
''l do not like green eggs and ham.
l do not like them, Sam--l--am.''

40:00.733 --> 40:02.803
Aren't you a little old for that book?

40:02.893 --> 40:05.566
-- She's reading to the baby.
-- Reading to the baby?

40:05.653 --> 40:09.726
Unborn babies, they're comforted
by the sound of their mother's voice.

40:09.813 --> 40:14.091
-- Just don't spoil my linebacker.
-- The baby's gonna be what it wants to be.

40:14.173 --> 40:17.882
Just let us be the parents, OK, Dad?
Come on, Bud. l'm hungry.

40:17.973 --> 40:19.531
Yeah. Me too.

40:23.973 --> 40:26.407
-- Hi, Mr Baker.
-- Hi, Eliot. What's up?

40:26.493 --> 40:28.609
-- l was looking for Sarah.
-- You mean Jake?

40:28.693 --> 40:31.844
Sarah and l and Calvin,
we're going boarding this afternoon.

40:31.933 --> 40:34.003
Well, she'll be back soon.

40:34.093 --> 40:38.530
-- OK. l'll just wait on the dock.
-- Wait, wait, wait.

40:38.613 --> 40:40.365
Sit down.

40:49.613 --> 40:52.332
What do you do for a living, Eliot?

40:53.813 --> 40:56.964
-- l'm in eighth grade.
-- Yeah. Right.

40:57.053 --> 41:00.887
-- And how's that going for you?
-- Fine.

41:00.973 --> 41:05.125
-- Are you on any teams?
-- Football, boarding and baseball.

41:05.213 --> 41:08.603
All that focus on sports --
that must impact your grades quite a bit.

41:08.693 --> 41:12.686
No. Actually, you know,
l'm an honours student.

41:13.813 --> 41:17.203
-- You play any instruments?
-- Drums.

41:17.293 --> 41:21.286
You're probably
in one of those punk bands, right?

41:22.533 --> 41:25.047
Timpani. You know, school orchestra.

41:26.893 --> 41:29.361
-- Hey, Eliot.
-- See you, Mr Baker.

41:29.453 --> 41:31.444
Later, dude... Dad.

41:39.933 --> 41:41.924
Guys.

41:43.533 --> 41:46.923
-- What now?
-- Mind if l go waterboarding with you?

41:47.013 --> 41:49.891
lt's kneeboarding,
and l'm pretty sure you can't do it.

41:49.973 --> 41:52.328
lf Jimmy can do it, l can.
You must be Calvin.

41:52.413 --> 41:55.803
-- Nice to meet you. l just got back from Yale.
-- Congratulations.

41:55.893 --> 41:58.805
l'll just squeeze in over here. There we go.

41:58.893 --> 42:01.009
-- ls everybody ready?
-- Yeah.

42:01.093 --> 42:05.291
-- Fun?
-- Yeah. Why don't you go first?

42:05.853 --> 42:08.765
Guys, keep an eye on him, all right?
You ready, Mr Baker?

42:08.853 --> 42:10.844
OK, l'm...

42:18.213 --> 42:22.650
-- Sorry he interrogated you.
-- My dad would have done the same thing.

42:28.973 --> 42:32.488
-- Really?
-- You should come to my house sometime.

42:42.133 --> 42:46.445
He's really easy and likes to keep low--key.

42:46.533 --> 42:50.412
-- Do you have a favourite subject?
-- Probably math.

43:00.653 --> 43:02.644
Stop!

43:05.253 --> 43:08.404
You'll do better next time, Mr Baker. lt's OK.

43:08.493 --> 43:12.372
-- Are you sure he'll be OK?
-- Yeah, he'll be fine.

43:16.213 --> 43:18.204
Dad! Are you OK?

43:19.373 --> 43:21.682
lt's all good.

43:26.533 --> 43:29.809
Well... l'll go put on a little perfume.

43:32.602 --> 43:36.038
Sarah, Eliot seems OK.

43:37.042 --> 43:39.761
-- l see why you like him.
-- Somebody's turning red.

43:39.842 --> 43:41.355
Shut up!

43:42.362 --> 43:44.796
Thanks a lot, Dad.

43:44.882 --> 43:47.919
-- What did l say?
-- Men can be so clueless.

43:48.002 --> 43:50.391
Honey, men are clueless.

43:52.922 --> 43:55.959
-- l'll go talk to her.
-- Mom, let me do this, OK?

43:56.042 --> 44:00.320
Trust me, l've got experience
in the area of parental harassment.

44:08.682 --> 44:11.355
Hey, l totally know how you feel.

44:11.442 --> 44:13.433
How are you?

44:14.882 --> 44:19.592
Dad can be pretty hands--on,
in--your--face sometimes.

44:19.682 --> 44:21.877
Just leave me alone.

44:29.082 --> 44:31.232
A, l'm never trying to help her again.

44:31.322 --> 44:34.632
And B, l cannot wait to move to New York.

45:18.682 --> 45:22.960
-- What are you doing here?
-- This is where l run. What are you doing?

45:23.042 --> 45:27.752
-- l like to get out of the house.
-- Take a break from the perfect daughter bit?

45:27.842 --> 45:31.881
Hey, l'm not the only one who's
putting on an act for Daddy around here.

45:31.962 --> 45:34.430
You've hated the city since we were kids.

45:34.522 --> 45:37.832
-- Why go to school there?
-- Seemed like the right thing to do.

45:37.922 --> 45:42.518
Did it seem like the right thing to do because
your parents said it was the right thing to do?

45:42.602 --> 45:45.355
No. My parents wanted me
closer to home, that's why.

45:45.442 --> 45:48.195
Are you gonna live at home forever?

45:48.282 --> 45:51.877
l just gotta figure out my next move and do it.

45:51.962 --> 45:56.035
How about you, superstar?
What's the master plan?

45:56.122 --> 45:59.273
Somehow l gotta tell my dad
l'm not built for corporate life.

45:59.362 --> 46:03.435
-- Good luck.
-- So for now, l'm just gonna draw.

46:03.522 --> 46:06.320
-- What do you draw?
-- Stay still, Baker.

46:06.402 --> 46:10.873
Whoa. Yeah, right. You're not drawing me,
cos l'm gonna... OK, right here? ls this good?

46:10.962 --> 46:13.999
-- lf l stay here? lt might be better...
-- Stop smiling.

46:23.202 --> 46:27.036
-- Sarah, come on. Hurry up!
-- OK. OK.

46:27.122 --> 46:30.080
-- Has anybody seen my other tennis shoe?
-- No.

46:30.162 --> 46:31.993
No, l haven't.

46:32.082 --> 46:36.075
-- Have you seen my other tennis shoe?
-- No. Chiseller!

46:36.162 --> 46:38.357
You chiselling little...

46:43.802 --> 46:44.791
Great.

46:49.242 --> 46:51.472
-- Hey, how are you doing?
-- Hey, guys.

46:51.562 --> 46:53.314
-- Good to see you.
-- Hi.

46:53.402 --> 46:56.280
Nice shoes. Kidding. Let's warm up.

46:56.362 --> 46:58.353
OK, let's do it.

47:00.642 --> 47:03.202
-- Come on, Murtaugh!
-- Got it.

47:03.722 --> 47:06.236
l don't remember you out here
when we were kids.

47:06.322 --> 47:10.474
Dad didn't allow us
to come out into the woods. OK, l'm done.

47:12.482 --> 47:16.794
That's Charlie Baker
figuring out his next move.

47:16.882 --> 47:20.591
-- You're good.
-- Tell my dad.

47:20.682 --> 47:23.594
Maybe he'll let me transfer
to Madison Art School.

47:23.682 --> 47:29.075
-- You wanna live up here and go to school?
-- This lake is my favourite place on the planet.

47:29.162 --> 47:32.837
-- Why?
-- l've always fantasised about moving here.

47:32.922 --> 47:35.436
l don't know,
maybe open up a garage or something.

47:35.522 --> 47:40.516
-- Looks like you figured out your next move.
-- l think you're right.

47:42.002 --> 47:44.038
Wanna go for a walk or something?

47:44.122 --> 47:49.719
-- ls Charlie Baker asking me out on a date?
-- l'm not sure our fathers would approve.

47:49.802 --> 47:51.793
Let's go.

47:55.202 --> 47:57.875
Yours. Nice. Nice!
This is mine.

48:00.562 --> 48:02.439
-- lt's these shoes.
-- OK. All right.

48:02.522 --> 48:04.797
A poor workman blames his tools, Tom.

48:04.882 --> 48:08.761
-- Just serve it.
-- This is payback for the china.

48:08.842 --> 48:13.154
Come on. Give me your best, Jimmy,
give me your best.

48:13.242 --> 48:15.551
-- l got it.
-- l got it.

48:15.642 --> 48:18.873
-- l got it, l got it, l got it.
-- l got it.

48:18.962 --> 48:20.077
Mine.

48:20.162 --> 48:21.959
-- Got it.
-- l got it.

48:30.442 --> 48:31.841
-- Mine.
-- Whoa.

48:34.642 --> 48:38.430
-- lt's turbo.
-- l'm in so much trouble. There's no way.

48:38.522 --> 48:41.036
-- Don't be a wimp.
-- l'm not a wimp.

48:41.122 --> 48:43.431
-- Come on. Get in.
-- OK, just one little cruise.

48:43.522 --> 48:45.956
Come on, Baker. l'm getting old here.

48:46.042 --> 48:48.033
Just be careful.

48:49.122 --> 48:50.111
Whoa! Slow down!

49:08.362 --> 49:13.516
Mr and Mrs Baker, excuse me. There's
a call from security over at the gift shop.

49:13.602 --> 49:16.275
-- What's this about?
-- Just follow me.

49:16.362 --> 49:18.353
Slow down! Stop!

49:20.322 --> 49:22.313
Slow down!

49:28.482 --> 49:32.600
We're willing to let it slide if you
promise to keep your kids under control.

49:32.682 --> 49:35.480
l really appreciate that.
We'll take care of it.

49:35.562 --> 49:39.601
-- There you go. Thanks, Skippy.
-- Thank you, Mr Murtaugh.

49:39.682 --> 49:41.479
Are you just gonna talk to her?

49:41.562 --> 49:44.838
How l discipline my kids
is none of your business.

49:44.922 --> 49:48.961
You know, l've been trying to say this
in a nice way, but...

49:49.042 --> 49:52.796
Well, there's a reason
your kids are screw--ups.

49:52.882 --> 49:56.113
My kids screwed up. They are not screw--ups.

49:56.202 --> 50:00.718
You're not strict enough.
Parenting isn't a popularity contest, Tom,

50:00.802 --> 50:04.317
but l guess if you knew that,
your kids wouldn't be so undisciplined.

50:04.402 --> 50:07.633
The only problem with my kids
is they're hanging out with yours.

50:07.722 --> 50:10.190
lt wasn't my daughter
who got caught stealing.

50:10.282 --> 50:12.398
lt wasn't my son who trashed a tennis court.

50:12.482 --> 50:15.872
Do you actually think
l'm screwing up my kids, Baker?

50:15.962 --> 50:18.396
Yeah. And one day they're gonna crack.

50:18.482 --> 50:21.394
Well, why don't we test that theory?
On Labor Day.

50:21.482 --> 50:25.316
Murtaughs versus Bakers. For the cup.

50:25.402 --> 50:27.677
You're on.

50:27.762 --> 50:29.957
We'll see you there.

50:32.122 --> 50:33.191
Let's go.

50:33.282 --> 50:36.160
Did you just agree
to that competition thing and the cup?

50:36.242 --> 50:38.233
Yeah.

50:40.442 --> 50:43.002
OK, missy, let's go walk and talk.

50:43.762 --> 50:48.438
Now, tell me what this is all about,
because it's so not you.

50:49.282 --> 50:52.752
-- l was embarrassed.
-- Look at me, honey.

50:52.842 --> 50:55.037
Embarrassed about what?

50:56.082 --> 50:58.277
Make--up.

50:58.362 --> 51:03.914
Honey, you know you can come to me
any time with anything. You know that, right?

51:06.282 --> 51:11.276
And l know why you wanted the make--up.
lt was for Eliot, right?

51:12.122 --> 51:13.635
Yeah.

51:13.722 --> 51:17.192
l'm just not pretty like Nora or Lorraine.

51:18.842 --> 51:22.551
l thought maybe the make--up would help.

51:22.642 --> 51:25.202
You're beautiful.

51:25.282 --> 51:28.558
l want you to remember
something else that's really important.

51:28.642 --> 51:32.840
When you like a boy,
never be anybody but yourself.

51:33.682 --> 51:37.038
Eliot liked you without make--up, didn't he?

51:37.842 --> 51:41.357
-- Do you think he really likes me?
-- How could he not?

51:43.762 --> 51:46.435
-- No more felonies. Deal?
-- Deal.

51:46.522 --> 51:48.513
Good.

51:49.522 --> 51:53.561
-- The Labor Day Cup's gonna be a bloodbath.
-- You got that right.

51:53.882 --> 51:59.115
From now on, no seeing the Murtaughs,
no talking to them, no thinking about them.

51:59.202 --> 52:02.160
-- Can't we compete and still see them?
-- No.

52:02.242 --> 52:04.836
Right now, l am not a father. l am a coach.

52:04.922 --> 52:09.916
And we're gonna be training twice a day,
every day, starting outside in ten minutes.

52:13.002 --> 52:16.074
Jumping jacks, jumping jacks. Good.

52:16.922 --> 52:22.042
Lorraine, come on. Push--ups. One, two.
Now back up to jumping jacks.

52:22.122 --> 52:25.239
-- Lorraine, come on.
-- OK.

52:28.002 --> 52:30.311
And toss.

52:30.402 --> 52:31.881
Toss.

52:31.962 --> 52:34.954
-- Toss. Toss.
-- Dad!

52:35.042 --> 52:36.760
-- Just toss.
-- Dad, lay off.

52:36.842 --> 52:38.878
-- Toss!
-- l'm tossing.

52:38.962 --> 52:41.032
No crying.

52:41.122 --> 52:44.512
-- Step back.
-- That's it. l can't handle the pressure, Dad!

52:44.602 --> 52:45.796
Eggs cost money.

52:48.642 --> 52:54.399
OK, it's a three--legged race, but run
as if you had two! On your mark, get set, go.

52:54.482 --> 52:56.074
Go. Let's go.

52:57.242 --> 52:58.675
-- Your fault!
-- Hey!

52:58.762 --> 53:01.435
Come on, come on, get in. Come on.

53:02.762 --> 53:07.040
-- Murtaugh! Murtaugh! Murtaugh! Murtaugh!
-- Dad! We're not Murtaughs!

53:17.602 --> 53:19.957
Take a deep swing. Boom, just like that.

53:36.442 --> 53:38.831
Give it a good one. Come on.

53:38.922 --> 53:40.196
One more.

53:45.082 --> 53:46.640
That's a zero.

54:01.202 --> 54:05.753
l really love having a family dinner where
all you can hear is forks hitting the plates.

54:05.842 --> 54:10.279
You know, this could be our last chance
together and you're totally ruining it.

54:10.362 --> 54:16.756
l'm glad we're moving to Houston. And so is
lron Mike or Donna Baker Butkus McNulty.

54:27.802 --> 54:29.394
Bulk up.

54:35.682 --> 54:38.515
You're burning a hole in my face.

54:38.602 --> 54:40.718
Tom.

54:40.802 --> 54:44.078
You've gotta stop
this whole training camp thing.

54:44.162 --> 54:50.158
This is not some little fence--line squabble.
This is an epic battle between two families.

54:50.242 --> 54:54.440
No. No, no, honey.
l think this is Tom versus Jimmy.

54:55.562 --> 54:58.998
l'm sorry, General, but you're losing
the respect of your troops.

54:59.082 --> 55:01.437
That's dangerous. Give the kids some space.

55:01.522 --> 55:03.717
Are you asking me to back out?

55:03.802 --> 55:08.478
No, honey. lt's just... Especially with Sarah.
This is her first crush. Come on.

55:08.562 --> 55:11.474
-- What, with Eliot?
-- Yes.

55:12.202 --> 55:15.512
She needs to know that we trust her.

55:15.602 --> 55:18.719
She couldn't come to me
and tell me she wanted to wear make--up.

55:18.802 --> 55:23.796
ls that the kind of relationship
you want her to have with us?

55:32.242 --> 55:35.120
-- Hey, Sarina. How are you?
-- Hi.

55:35.202 --> 55:37.670
Let's run.

55:37.762 --> 55:39.957
Just leave it. They'll get somebody.

55:40.042 --> 55:42.397
The kids drop stuff all the time
and leave me.

55:42.482 --> 55:44.552
-- Can l ask you a question?
-- Sure.

55:44.642 --> 55:48.521
-- How do you manage 12 kids?
-- With great difficulty. Trust me.

55:48.602 --> 55:51.912
Good, cos l have no idea what l'm doing.

55:52.882 --> 55:56.079
You've got a lot of fruit.
l'd get some of this refined sugar.

55:56.162 --> 56:00.075
lt's great for
negotiating purposes or whatever.

56:00.162 --> 56:02.756
Jimmy's gone overboard
with this tough love thing.

56:02.842 --> 56:05.675
The kids are miserable
and he doesn't even see it.

56:05.762 --> 56:07.912
He and Tom bring out the best in each other.

56:08.002 --> 56:11.392
l'm actually getting a kick out of it.
Very entertaining.

56:11.482 --> 56:13.791
-- And exhausting.
-- This is good.

56:14.122 --> 56:16.955
lf tonight's good, l'll ask my dad.

56:18.202 --> 56:22.593
So hopefully tonight will work.
OK. See you.

56:27.122 --> 56:29.113
Not my little girl.

56:37.282 --> 56:38.954
Hey, Dad.

56:39.562 --> 56:41.280
Are you OK?

56:41.362 --> 56:47.232
Yeah. l just need you to help me
pace out 25 yards for the egg race,

56:47.322 --> 56:49.995
starting here, OK? There you go.

56:50.082 --> 56:52.073
-- Yeah.
-- OK, go ahead.

56:54.562 --> 56:58.441
-- Hey, Dad, l was...
-- Those steps are too small.

57:03.482 --> 57:08.112
-- Those steps...
-- Can l go to the movies with Eliot tonight?

57:10.122 --> 57:11.874
..are too big.

57:18.122 --> 57:20.477
l guess so.

57:27.242 --> 57:28.197
Sarah!

57:28.282 --> 57:33.595
Sarah! Nora has to urinate, and a full bladder
puts inordinate strain on the embryotic sac...

57:33.682 --> 57:36.594
Kim! Thank you.
We could just go with ''hurry up''.

57:36.682 --> 57:38.991
Hurry up!

57:40.082 --> 57:42.880
l need Lorraine.

57:45.122 --> 57:48.080
You get Lorraine, l'll pee outside.

57:50.522 --> 57:52.672
Hey. lt's me.

57:54.122 --> 57:56.716
How's it going?

57:58.122 --> 58:04.311
Eliot asked me out, and l'm kind of new
to the dating thing, so...

58:08.082 --> 58:12.553
-- Are you gonna make me beg?
-- l was thinking about it.

58:14.882 --> 58:16.873
Come on.

58:18.002 --> 58:20.800
Let's start with your make--up.

58:23.482 --> 58:25.473
Lorraine...

58:26.522 --> 58:29.195
-- Thanks.
-- Don't worry about it.

58:31.402 --> 58:32.835
-- Pink?
-- Come on.

58:32.922 --> 58:35.755
Can't we do, like, a skin colour?

58:36.282 --> 58:38.876
There you go. lt looks good.

58:45.202 --> 58:47.158
Hey, guys.

58:47.242 --> 58:49.312
Guys. l need everybody's attention.

58:49.402 --> 58:53.111
Sarah's about to come downstairs,
and she's going on her date tonight.

58:53.202 --> 58:56.956
She looks a little different,
so l would really appreciate it

58:57.042 --> 59:00.830
if you guys could give her
the respect that you never gave me,

59:00.922 --> 59:07.077
and not ridicule her style choices before she
enters the world of multi--gender interaction.

59:07.162 --> 59:10.199
So go about your little chores
and act completely natural.

59:10.282 --> 59:12.750
Lorraine.

59:12.842 --> 59:16.630
l think you're going
to do just fine in New York.

59:16.722 --> 59:18.713
Thank you.

59:29.882 --> 59:32.271
Hubba--hubba.

59:45.042 --> 59:47.556
You look very pretty, honey. You always do.

59:47.642 --> 59:49.598
Thank you.

59:49.682 --> 59:51.912
Well, l'm going to the movies.

59:52.002 --> 59:54.436
Well, sounds good. Need some money?

59:54.522 --> 59:57.195
No. l have some from lawn mowing.

59:58.482 --> 01:00:02.236
-- Limo's here.
-- There's Mr Murtaugh.

01:00:02.322 --> 01:00:07.112
Well, have fun, and l'll pick you up
outside the theatre at nine.

01:00:07.202 --> 01:00:09.193
Bye.

01:00:11.842 --> 01:00:13.833
-- Bye.
-- Bye, cutie.

01:00:15.082 --> 01:00:18.279
l'll save a spot for you on the varsity.

01:00:20.122 --> 01:00:22.511
Have fun.

01:00:24.002 --> 01:00:26.197
-- Cute, isn't she?
-- Yeah.

01:00:27.282 --> 01:00:30.752
Seems like yesterday that was you, missy.

01:00:33.442 --> 01:00:38.641
-- You're not gonna start crying, are you, Dad?
-- l'm a football coach, remember?

01:00:38.722 --> 01:00:42.032
-- l like Henrietta.
-- You are not calling it Henrietta.

01:00:42.122 --> 01:00:44.920
All right. What have we got to eat?

01:00:52.362 --> 01:00:54.671
Can l go to the movies with Eliot?

01:00:54.762 --> 01:00:58.641
Can l go to the movies with Eliot?

01:01:00.522 --> 01:01:04.117
Honey, do you want something to eat?

01:01:05.922 --> 01:01:07.913
Tom, do you want something to eat?

01:01:08.002 --> 01:01:11.119
No. You know what?
Actually, l should go get Sarah.

01:01:11.202 --> 01:01:13.397
lt's 7:30. The movie just started.

01:01:13.482 --> 01:01:17.395
l'm not going directly.
l'm just gonna stop and get gas first.

01:01:17.482 --> 01:01:20.713
There's bound to be traffic,
cos it's Labor Day weekend.

01:01:20.802 --> 01:01:22.713
-- Sure there is.
-- l'll get going.

01:01:22.802 --> 01:01:27.671
And l don't trust those fish clocks.
They're notoriously slow.

01:01:27.762 --> 01:01:29.480
l love you, sweetheart.

01:01:29.562 --> 01:01:30.995
Thank you.

01:01:31.082 --> 01:01:32.993
One, please.

01:01:48.082 --> 01:01:50.550
What are you doing here?

01:01:50.642 --> 01:01:54.840
lf you must know, l'm here to make sure
this movie is appropriate for our children.

01:01:54.922 --> 01:01:57.482
lt's rated G.

01:01:59.122 --> 01:02:01.716
Sir, could you please sit down?

01:02:03.442 --> 01:02:07.674
-- What are you doing here so early?
-- Father of the daughter always arrives early.

01:02:07.762 --> 01:02:11.437
-- Everybody knows that.
-- Excuse me. ls there a problem here?

01:02:11.522 --> 01:02:14.480
-- He's harassing me.
-- He's guilty of overparenting.

01:02:14.562 --> 01:02:19.716
lf you two can't keep it down,
l'm going to throw both of you out.

01:02:28.282 --> 01:02:30.352
My God. Look at this.

01:02:31.122 --> 01:02:33.511
What? He's stretching.

01:02:37.162 --> 01:02:40.154
-- He's doing ''the move''.
-- What move?

01:02:42.042 --> 01:02:46.001
You're sitting in the theatre, you fake a yawn...

01:02:46.082 --> 01:02:48.676
Oh, boy, am l tired.

01:02:50.042 --> 01:02:52.272
Hand comes over.

01:02:52.362 --> 01:02:56.514
Then a little while later, head comes over,
giving you extra reach here.

01:02:56.602 --> 01:02:59.036
Mom, look at those two down there.

01:02:59.122 --> 01:03:01.795
See what l mean?

01:03:01.882 --> 01:03:03.634
Sweet Jesus.

01:03:06.002 --> 01:03:10.280
-- Warning number two.
-- He was showing me ''the move''.

01:03:13.282 --> 01:03:15.318
Do you mind?

01:03:18.722 --> 01:03:21.998
-- You don't know ''the move''?
-- No. l don't know ''the move'', OK?

01:03:22.082 --> 01:03:26.280
And l wasn't a hormone--crazed Romeo
when l was a kid. l had self--control.

01:03:26.362 --> 01:03:29.798
-- l had social sophistication, like my son.
-- Be quiet down there!

01:03:29.882 --> 01:03:34.319
-- Your son has hormones like every teenager.
-- Meaning what?

01:03:34.402 --> 01:03:38.190
Meaning on the sophistication scale,
he's one step above ape.

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:42.321
-- Are you calling my son an ape?
-- He's an ape like every other male teenager.

01:03:42.402 --> 01:03:45.200
-- Take it back.
-- l'm not gonna take it back.

01:03:45.282 --> 01:03:47.193
Take it...

01:03:47.282 --> 01:03:48.556
Take it back.

01:03:48.642 --> 01:03:52.601
-- Were you gonna poke me?
-- No, l was not gonna poke you.

01:03:52.682 --> 01:03:55.913
-- You were gonna poke me.
-- Because you were asking for it.

01:03:56.002 --> 01:03:58.835
lf l'm asking for it,
why don't you give it to me?

01:03:58.922 --> 01:04:03.040
-- You want a poke?
-- What's going on down there?

01:04:03.122 --> 01:04:05.352
-- Call that a poke?
-- l call that a practice.

01:04:05.442 --> 01:04:08.718
-- Give me your best poke. l want your best.
-- You're asking for it.

01:04:08.802 --> 01:04:10.713
l do. Yeah.

01:04:13.522 --> 01:04:16.594
Hey! Call somebody. Somebody help.

01:04:24.882 --> 01:04:28.431
-- Hey, honey, how did it go?
-- Dad was totally spying on me.

01:04:28.522 --> 01:04:30.319
You ruined everything.

01:04:30.402 --> 01:04:35.476
There's no way that l'm competing for you
in that stupid cup tomorrow.

01:04:37.442 --> 01:04:41.230
-- l can't believe you did that.
-- Really, Dad, that is so Big Brother.

01:04:41.322 --> 01:04:45.918
-- Yeah, let's go.
-- Come on, Bud, let's put this baby to bed.

01:04:46.002 --> 01:04:48.357
Not cool, Dad.

01:04:48.442 --> 01:04:54.551
You and Jimmy aren't so different, Dad.
Different styles, yeah, but same result.

01:04:54.642 --> 01:04:57.031
Let's go, guys.

01:04:57.722 --> 01:04:59.792
Honey.

01:04:59.882 --> 01:05:01.952
Honey, we talked about this, didn't we?

01:05:02.042 --> 01:05:06.240
The tighter you hang on,
the more they're gonna pull away. Right?

01:05:06.322 --> 01:05:08.313
l'll go talk to her.

01:05:17.442 --> 01:05:20.673
Well, we're gonna go compete for the cup.

01:05:21.682 --> 01:05:25.391
Couldn't get any more volunteers?

01:05:25.482 --> 01:05:28.076
You gonna come
and watch us kick some hiney?

01:05:28.162 --> 01:05:32.633
Well, maybe l will, honey,
when l get everybody fed.

01:05:32.722 --> 01:05:34.713
l'm sorry.

01:05:40.322 --> 01:05:43.792
-- OK, guys. Come on, let's go.
-- Come on, Dad.

01:05:43.882 --> 01:05:45.918
And l'm sorry too.

01:05:52.122 --> 01:05:56.798
-- Did Dad go?
-- Yep. With Kyle and Nigel.

01:06:11.242 --> 01:06:13.881
Hey. The Chiseller's got my wallet.

01:06:21.202 --> 01:06:23.670
-- Check it out.
-- Must have an escape hatch.

01:06:23.762 --> 01:06:29.155
-- Look at all this stuff.
-- That's mine from, like, the '80s.

01:06:31.322 --> 01:06:33.313
Careful. Careful.

01:06:34.882 --> 01:06:37.077
Let me see that.

01:06:38.842 --> 01:06:41.072
Look at this.

01:06:41.162 --> 01:06:43.471
lt's our old team flag.

01:06:43.562 --> 01:06:45.757
We lost to the Murtaughs by two points.

01:06:45.842 --> 01:06:48.117
Yeah, cos Mom fell in the sack race.

01:06:48.202 --> 01:06:51.000
Daddy carried me all the way home.
Fond memories.

01:06:51.082 --> 01:06:54.870
You know your father. He wants to be
a part of every single one of them.

01:06:54.962 --> 01:06:57.556
That's why he's having
such a hard time letting go.

01:06:57.642 --> 01:07:03.035
But one thing -- no matter what Daddy says,
if he's in a good mood or a bad mood,

01:07:03.122 --> 01:07:05.920
you're his favourite team, right?

01:07:14.042 --> 01:07:16.840
And left. And right.

01:07:17.642 --> 01:07:20.236
And left. And right.

01:07:20.322 --> 01:07:22.199
And left...

01:07:22.282 --> 01:07:24.273
Bakers.

01:07:26.522 --> 01:07:29.161
What gives, Tom? Couldn't rally your team?

01:07:29.242 --> 01:07:32.951
lt's all l've got,
but it's enough to take you down, Murtaugh.

01:07:33.042 --> 01:07:37.718
Are you kidding me?
You'll be lucky to beat the Doobners.

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:43.394
-- We'll see. Come on, guys.
-- We'll see.

01:07:43.482 --> 01:07:48.920
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the 46th
annual Lake Winnetka Labor Day Cup.

01:07:50.962 --> 01:07:54.193
Now, we have seven families
competing in ten events today.

01:07:54.282 --> 01:07:57.831
The family winning the most events
will win the cup. Simple enough.

01:07:57.922 --> 01:08:02.393
So let's get to it, all right?
Contestants, here we go.

01:08:05.162 --> 01:08:08.472
OK, guys. Let's do this.

01:08:15.602 --> 01:08:17.991
Hey, Dad. We're here.

01:08:25.042 --> 01:08:27.033
Dad!

01:08:29.841 --> 01:08:32.834
There's the team. There's the team.

01:08:34.122 --> 01:08:36.238
You can't keep the varsity down.

01:08:36.322 --> 01:08:41.350
And l promise never to go on a date
with you and Eliot again.

01:08:43.122 --> 01:08:45.477
Hey, Murtaugh!

01:08:45.562 --> 01:08:48.122
This is our year!

01:08:48.202 --> 01:08:50.078
Let's see what you got, Tom.

01:08:52.562 --> 01:08:55.520
-- OK, Murtaughs.
-- Huddling.

01:08:55.602 --> 01:08:58.162
l've been ajerk all week,
but that's old news.

01:08:58.242 --> 01:09:01.837
-- Get loose. Don't let 'em intimidate you.
-- Yeah!

01:09:01.921 --> 01:09:04.595
You each have a special talent.
l want you to use it.

01:09:04.682 --> 01:09:07.321
l don't care if we win or lose.
Just do your best.

01:09:07.402 --> 01:09:10.200
OK. Hey, what are you doing?

01:09:10.282 --> 01:09:12.671
Stop with the nicey--nice.

01:09:14.082 --> 01:09:19.475
Here's the game plan. We'll step on their
throats and press until they stop breathing.

01:09:19.562 --> 01:09:22.679
-- Yeah!
-- Get focused and stay with the game plan.

01:09:22.761 --> 01:09:26.198
-- What would that be?
-- We don't have a game plan, but...

01:09:26.282 --> 01:09:29.671
-- Chin up. Charge the mountain!
-- Exactly! That's the game plan.

01:09:29.761 --> 01:09:30.990
OK, break on three.

01:09:31.322 --> 01:09:33.756
One, two, three.

01:09:36.362 --> 01:09:38.238
Come on, come on, come on.

01:09:38.322 --> 01:09:40.040
Come on, go. Come on, go. Go, go!

01:09:40.122 --> 01:09:41.714
Yes! Yes!

01:09:42.602 --> 01:09:44.991
Yeah, Mark! Come on.

01:09:45.761 --> 01:09:47.194
Go! Go!

01:09:47.282 --> 01:09:49.716
Charge it, charge it, charge it!

01:09:58.642 --> 01:10:00.633
Good job.

01:10:02.402 --> 01:10:04.233
OK. That's OK.

01:10:08.682 --> 01:10:11.674
-- Bull's--eye!
-- One for the Bakers!

01:10:22.842 --> 01:10:25.037
Come on, Charlie.

01:10:25.122 --> 01:10:27.238
-- That's it. That's it.
-- Go! Go!

01:10:32.002 --> 01:10:33.879
Go, superstar.

01:10:33.962 --> 01:10:35.714
Yeah!

01:10:36.682 --> 01:10:40.561
-- Gotta be tough, Baker. Gotta be tough.
-- What is this?

01:10:49.162 --> 01:10:50.959
Out.

01:11:05.962 --> 01:11:08.635
-- Here we go, Tom.
-- l'm OK, Murtaugh.

01:11:08.722 --> 01:11:10.838
Look out.

01:11:11.682 --> 01:11:14.355
Not your sport?

01:11:14.442 --> 01:11:16.717
Go for ajog.

01:11:16.802 --> 01:11:18.440
Come on. Keep up.

01:11:20.082 --> 01:11:22.232
Reverse.

01:11:22.322 --> 01:11:25.394
Couldn't have asked for a better day.

01:11:28.602 --> 01:11:30.832
Look out!

01:11:34.082 --> 01:11:36.073
Ouch.

01:11:38.762 --> 01:11:44.712
Well, folks, for the first time since 1961,
our Labor Day Cup has ended in a tie.

01:11:48.002 --> 01:11:50.436
The Miller family
will be taking third place.

01:11:50.522 --> 01:11:53.320
And to determine second place
and our champion,

01:11:53.402 --> 01:11:56.917
the Bakers and the Murtaughs
are going to have a canoe race

01:11:57.002 --> 01:12:00.278
from here to the State Forest
end of the park and back.

01:12:00.362 --> 01:12:02.751
And all family members must participate.

01:12:02.842 --> 01:12:06.721
Mike, l got a daughter who's due in a week.
She can't do that.

01:12:06.802 --> 01:12:09.919
Tom, maybe you can
work something out with Jimmy here.

01:12:10.002 --> 01:12:13.472
Looks like you're gonna have to forfeit, Tom.

01:12:13.562 --> 01:12:15.553
Well...

01:12:23.442 --> 01:12:26.320
She can't do it, so we're done.

01:12:26.402 --> 01:12:28.393
And congratulations.

01:12:30.882 --> 01:12:32.873
l'm going, Dad.

01:12:34.522 --> 01:12:37.753
You just pissed off
a severely hormonal pregnant woman.

01:12:37.842 --> 01:12:39.434
Let's do this!

01:12:40.042 --> 01:12:42.033
Nora?

01:12:44.202 --> 01:12:46.841
-- Are you sure?
-- l need a life jacket.

01:12:46.922 --> 01:12:49.959
-- Go, Bakers.
-- Come on, Murtaughs.

01:12:50.042 --> 01:12:54.035
-- Lose those shoes. They're fancy and new.
-- What? Yours are the same.

01:12:54.122 --> 01:12:56.590
l'm a mom. l need the height.
Take those off.

01:12:56.682 --> 01:12:59.958
Mom. Mine tie my new outfit in together.

01:13:04.642 --> 01:13:07.281
Stay on the north side of the lake.
There's less wind.

01:13:07.362 --> 01:13:11.150
-- Thanks, Murtaugh.
-- You're welcome, Baker.

01:13:12.402 --> 01:13:14.916
Let's go, superstar.

01:13:15.002 --> 01:13:16.993
lt's supposed to be fun.

01:13:33.042 --> 01:13:35.795
-- You ready?
-- Ready.

01:13:35.882 --> 01:13:38.760
-- On your marks.
-- Murtaugh!

01:13:38.842 --> 01:13:40.673
-- Get set.
-- Murtaugh!

01:13:53.202 --> 01:13:56.319
Go, Bakers! Go, Bakers!

01:14:02.922 --> 01:14:04.992
Come on, we'll catch up. Let's go.

01:14:05.082 --> 01:14:08.552
We're gonna win this, Murtaughs!

01:14:08.642 --> 01:14:11.281
Come on. Put some muscle in it, Bakers.

01:14:11.362 --> 01:14:13.353
Stroke.

01:14:15.602 --> 01:14:18.400
-- Stroke.
-- Stroke.

01:14:18.482 --> 01:14:21.315
Come on, superstar. Come on, Kenneth.

01:14:21.402 --> 01:14:24.155
-- Not this time, Murtaugh.
-- That's what you think.

01:14:24.242 --> 01:14:26.551
Stroke, stroke.

01:14:32.362 --> 01:14:34.796
l think we're taking on water.

01:14:34.882 --> 01:14:36.474
lt's me.

01:14:36.562 --> 01:14:39.872
My God! My God!
Nora's waterjust broke.

01:14:41.882 --> 01:14:43.759
Jimmy!

01:14:43.842 --> 01:14:46.436
-- Row! Row!
-- Jimmy!

01:14:47.402 --> 01:14:51.156
-- Something's wrong, Jimmy.
-- He's trying to pull a fast one. Now, paddle.

01:14:51.242 --> 01:14:54.200
-- l don't believe it.
-- What if somebody's hurt?

01:14:54.282 --> 01:14:56.750
Honey, we have a substantial lead. lt's a trick.

01:14:56.842 --> 01:15:02.235
-- How can you be sure?
-- l don't wanna lose. Now, paddle. Stroke.

01:15:03.122 --> 01:15:04.874
OK, everyone, calm down.

01:15:04.962 --> 01:15:07.874
-- lf we cut through, the road's not far.
-- Can you get us there?

01:15:07.962 --> 01:15:10.840
-- Hello. Nature boy, remember?
-- Let's go.

01:15:10.922 --> 01:15:12.640
-- Sit tight.
-- Go faster.

01:15:12.722 --> 01:15:15.316
-- No, Bud. Stay with Nora.
-- Row.

01:15:17.042 --> 01:15:20.512
Annie, what are you doing?
What are you doing, superstar? Paddle.

01:15:20.602 --> 01:15:23.480
l'm not a superstar, Dad.

01:15:25.402 --> 01:15:28.360
l'm just a person
who's trying to have her own life.

01:15:28.442 --> 01:15:31.514
And this is not my idea of living. lt's yours.

01:15:33.962 --> 01:15:36.192
Like my tattoo?

01:15:39.642 --> 01:15:43.032
-- Annie, get back in this boat.
-- You'll have to win it without me too.

01:15:43.122 --> 01:15:45.511
Eliot, don't you dare. Don't you...

01:15:45.602 --> 01:15:48.514
-- l'm outta here.
-- Kenneth!

01:15:49.002 --> 01:15:52.517
-- Not cool, Dad.
-- Becky, don't you...

01:15:52.602 --> 01:15:55.753
-- You've gotta lighten up.
-- Daniel!

01:15:55.842 --> 01:15:58.436
-- We like the Bakers.
-- Yeah, Dad.

01:15:58.522 --> 01:16:01.036
Lisa! Robin!

01:16:01.122 --> 01:16:05.991
OK, that's it. You know what? You kids
are gonna be cut off if you don't, you know...

01:16:06.082 --> 01:16:09.154
No more charge accounts. Think about that.

01:16:09.242 --> 01:16:11.995
-- What is wrong with you?
-- l want to win!

01:16:12.082 --> 01:16:16.234
You don't get it, Sarina. lt's not me.
lt's him. lt's Tom.

01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:19.394
He was always the popular one.
He was the one everybody liked.

01:16:19.482 --> 01:16:22.360
Everybody. All the girls.
All the parents liked him.

01:16:22.442 --> 01:16:26.640
-- My own father even liked him better.
-- That was 18 years before l was born.

01:16:26.722 --> 01:16:30.681
Get over it. Look, your kids
are trying to tell you something.

01:16:30.762 --> 01:16:34.721
And unless you wanna start looking
for wife number four, you'd better listen.

01:16:34.802 --> 01:16:36.793
Now, paddle.

01:16:38.762 --> 01:16:41.913
-- Watch out.
-- Are you sure you're OK?

01:16:42.002 --> 01:16:44.960
-- 50 cents says it's a girl.
-- l'll take that bet.

01:16:45.042 --> 01:16:46.953
-- l'm in.
-- Mom, Mom, Mom!

01:16:47.042 --> 01:16:49.920
-- l'm all right, l'm all right.
-- l got you, l got you!

01:16:50.002 --> 01:16:53.233
That's OK. l got my hips to balance me.
How are you feeling?

01:16:53.322 --> 01:16:55.153
-- Cramping a little.
-- OK, how often?

01:16:55.242 --> 01:16:57.710
Just a couple of times so far.

01:16:59.842 --> 01:17:03.551
-- l think l'm going to be sick.
-- Pay attention to her!

01:17:03.642 --> 01:17:05.712
ls she OK?

01:17:05.802 --> 01:17:09.590
Yeah. She's delivering lakeside, but yeah.
Did you swim all the way here?

01:17:09.682 --> 01:17:14.073
-- Baker, what's going on?
-- Nora's having her baby. We need a hospital.

01:17:14.162 --> 01:17:16.517
-- What can l do to help?
-- You can help with Nora.

01:17:16.602 --> 01:17:19.480
-- Mark's on point. Right?
-- l know the area really well.

01:17:19.562 --> 01:17:23.521
Dad forced me to read topographical maps
of this area, for no apparent reason.

01:17:23.602 --> 01:17:26.355
Hey, that's my boy.
Lead the way, Kenneth Murtaugh.

01:17:26.442 --> 01:17:29.673
My dad has let me have
almost every animal in the world,

01:17:29.762 --> 01:17:31.798
which makes me an expert on scat trails.

01:17:31.882 --> 01:17:35.079
-- That's my boy.
-- Point us the right way, l'll find a scat trail.

01:17:35.162 --> 01:17:37.039
-- What's ''scat''?
-- Animal poop.

01:17:37.122 --> 01:17:39.716
Cool, we're following poop.

01:17:40.722 --> 01:17:43.759
OK, l'm a little competitive.

01:17:43.842 --> 01:17:45.560
-- l know.
-- Go! Go!

01:17:45.642 --> 01:17:48.839
-- Come on, guys. This way.
-- There's a road up ahead.

01:18:08.562 --> 01:18:10.553
Yeah. We did it!

01:18:12.202 --> 01:18:14.193
Come on, guys, this way.

01:18:17.842 --> 01:18:20.640
Come on. Hurry! Come on, hurry up!

01:18:24.642 --> 01:18:27.281
l'll take it from here. l got it.

01:18:31.762 --> 01:18:34.595
My daughter is about to deliver
and l need to get her in.

01:18:34.682 --> 01:18:38.641
l don't want her to feel any pain.
l want the baby to be healthy. Get it? Good.

01:18:38.722 --> 01:18:42.874
-- lf l could get you to fill out...
-- l wouldn't mess with her if l were you, OK?

01:18:42.962 --> 01:18:44.600
Right.

01:18:44.682 --> 01:18:47.515
-- Wow.
-- She's having a baby.

01:18:48.602 --> 01:18:51.594
Stay calm! Can we get a chair over here?!

01:18:51.682 --> 01:18:54.560
-- Get me in a wheelchair.
-- l need a wheelchair, stat!

01:18:54.642 --> 01:18:56.314
Get the chair!

01:18:57.122 --> 01:18:59.590
-- My God. My God.
-- Good luck.

01:19:07.202 --> 01:19:09.591
lt must be this way.

01:19:09.682 --> 01:19:12.799
That way. All right.
Family only in the delivery room.

01:19:12.882 --> 01:19:16.670
-- Whoa, whoa! You're all family?
-- Yes.

01:19:16.762 --> 01:19:18.798
-- Help me out here.
-- l'm her mother.

01:19:18.882 --> 01:19:21.112
-- Of course.
-- Kate.

01:19:22.762 --> 01:19:24.753
Do your thing.

01:19:27.282 --> 01:19:32.037
-- OK, come on. Let's go.
-- Tom, actually, we'd like Lorraine to come.

01:19:32.122 --> 01:19:34.431
We want you to be the godmother.

01:19:34.522 --> 01:19:36.911
Really?

01:19:37.002 --> 01:19:39.232
Whoa! Having a baby here!

01:19:39.322 --> 01:19:43.793
-- We'll try to get you a linebacker, Tom.
-- Come on, everybody. Come on.

01:19:43.882 --> 01:19:46.350
This is a hospital. You guys have to be quiet.

01:19:46.442 --> 01:19:48.273
Tom.

01:19:48.362 --> 01:19:50.637
You mind if we wait with you?

01:19:50.722 --> 01:19:52.553
That'd be great.

01:20:03.522 --> 01:20:05.638
They're good kids, Jimmy. All of 'em.

01:20:05.722 --> 01:20:08.156
And you're saying we have
nothing to do with it?

01:20:08.242 --> 01:20:09.960
They're born hard--wired.

01:20:10.042 --> 01:20:11.873
-- Look what we found.
-- Check it out.

01:20:11.962 --> 01:20:15.193
Hey. Just be sure and disinfect them.

01:20:15.282 --> 01:20:18.194
lt's a bedpan, Kenny. Take it off.

01:20:18.282 --> 01:20:21.957
-- So your kid gets my kid to wear a bedpan...
-- l didn't tell him to do it.

01:20:22.282 --> 01:20:27.481
You look in the face of a six--month--old
and that's the way they are.

01:20:30.122 --> 01:20:34.001
You look like
you have something to say.

01:20:34.082 --> 01:20:39.634
l'm done with the city, Dad. l'm gonna open
up my own garage and l'm moving up here.

01:20:39.722 --> 01:20:41.872
And l wanna audit art classes at Madison.

01:20:41.962 --> 01:20:45.352
-- Pardon me?
-- Dad, l wanna be an artist.

01:20:45.442 --> 01:20:48.673
l don't think that's gonna happen.

01:20:49.202 --> 01:20:51.238
Jimmy.

01:20:53.482 --> 01:20:56.838
Although it does sound pretty exciting.

01:21:01.962 --> 01:21:07.161
-- Sweetheart, is this what you really want?
-- l'm sure.

01:21:07.242 --> 01:21:11.520
You know, Annie,
l was just trying to be a good father.

01:21:12.322 --> 01:21:14.711
l know.

01:21:17.882 --> 01:21:21.033
-- What do you think?
-- Sounds like you got your mind made up.

01:21:21.122 --> 01:21:23.431
l do. You OK with that?

01:21:25.322 --> 01:21:27.597
Yeah. l think l am.

01:21:32.882 --> 01:21:34.873
Excuse me. Tom?

01:21:37.002 --> 01:21:39.118
You wanna meet your grandson?

01:21:41.962 --> 01:21:43.839
Yeah.

01:22:07.242 --> 01:22:10.200
You did a good job, honey. Really good job.

01:22:10.282 --> 01:22:14.514
That's a big boy. Too bad
he wasn't there to help us win the cup.

01:22:14.602 --> 01:22:16.877
He'll get a chance.

01:22:16.962 --> 01:22:19.237
Mike Romanow gave me a deal.

01:22:20.202 --> 01:22:23.080
Now we own the big house at the lake.

01:22:24.922 --> 01:22:27.994
lt'll be nice having you
in the neighbourhood, Bud.

01:22:28.082 --> 01:22:33.156
You Murtaughs better start cranking out
grandkids if you wanna compete.

01:22:33.242 --> 01:22:37.235
You guys. My godchild is trying to snooze.

01:22:37.322 --> 01:22:40.394
So, any ideas on names?

01:22:43.202 --> 01:22:46.478
l think we're going to go with ''Tom''.

01:22:46.562 --> 01:22:50.635
Cos you taught us
that there's no way to be a perfect parent,

01:22:50.722 --> 01:22:54.112
but a million ways to be a really good one.

01:22:56.122 --> 01:22:59.432
And you're about as good as they get.

01:22:59.522 --> 01:23:01.513
Say hi to Grandpa.

01:23:02.282 --> 01:23:04.113
Go on.

01:23:13.722 --> 01:23:15.713
You're so beautiful.

01:23:22.202 --> 01:23:24.716
Tom. Hey, Tom.

01:23:31.082 --> 01:23:33.277
Welcome to family.

01:24:03.962 --> 01:24:07.557
Letting go is the hardest thing
you can do as a parent.

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:11.271
You have to settle with the past,
engage in the present,

01:24:11.362 --> 01:24:13.478
and believe in the future.

01:24:13.562 --> 01:24:16.076
That vacation at Lake Winnetka
reminded Tom and me

01:24:16.162 --> 01:24:22.237
that we're always learning as parents,
and that the bond is forever.

01:24:22.322 --> 01:24:24.995
Even as the kids grow up
and venture out on their own,

01:24:25.082 --> 01:24:28.791
we'll always be with them
and they'll always be with us.

01:24:28.882 --> 01:24:32.477
Because life is a voyage
that's homeward bound.

01:25:35.442 --> 01:25:37.910
ls this my normal face?

01:25:39.882 --> 01:25:42.476
Hi, Poo--poo. You want a treat?

01:25:48.922 --> 01:25:50.640
Can l redo that?

01:25:55.242 --> 01:25:57.233
What are we gonna do?

01:25:58.322 --> 01:26:02.600
She'll never walk again, l'll tell you that.

01:29:52.802 --> 01:29:55.521
