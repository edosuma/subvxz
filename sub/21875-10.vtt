He's great! Look at him!

00:27.190 --> 00:29.220
Yeah! Come on! Yeah!

00:32.060 --> 00:33.590
Come on, get up!

( dog barking in distance )

01:08.060 --> 01:10.300
Well, it's about time
you showed up.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.900
Let's just get this
over with, all right?

01:11.900 --> 01:13.630
It was nice
doing business with you,

01:13.640 --> 01:14.840
but now I'm out.

01:16.740 --> 01:18.740
You're not gettin' paid, Randy.

01:20.380 --> 01:22.080
( sighs )

01:22.080 --> 01:24.610
Don't mess around
with me, Wade. All right?

01:24.610 --> 01:26.310
I said I'm through.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.980
I'm finished.
I had enough.

01:27.980 --> 01:29.480
You got some big problems, kid.

01:29.480 --> 01:31.150
Lyle is dead.

01:31.150 --> 01:33.520
He walked out to the car,
and then he collapsed.

01:34.590 --> 01:36.290
Must have been
a brain hemorrhage.

01:36.290 --> 01:37.560
A brain hemorrhage?

01:37.560 --> 01:39.690
You gave him some
pretty good shots, kid.

01:41.930 --> 01:43.600
Did you call
an ambulance?

01:43.600 --> 01:44.970
Didn't you hear me?

01:44.970 --> 01:46.330
He's dead.

01:46.340 --> 01:47.870
Well, if he's dead,
shouldn't--

01:47.870 --> 01:49.600
Shouldn't we call somebody?

01:49.600 --> 01:50.970
What about the police?

01:50.970 --> 01:52.540
What are you, crazy?
Come on, grow up.

01:52.540 --> 01:54.110
This is an illegal fight.

01:54.110 --> 01:55.580
Somebody gets killed,
it's murder.

01:55.580 --> 01:58.180
No. No, wait, no.
It was an accident.

01:58.180 --> 02:00.080
If you're lucky,
they'll call it manslaughter.

02:00.080 --> 02:01.880
That's 15 years.

02:01.880 --> 02:05.750
And a Texas prison
means real hard time.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.350
You wanna take that chance?

02:12.060 --> 02:13.290
What are we gonna do?

02:13.300 --> 02:15.330
You let me worry about it.

02:15.330 --> 02:17.200
I'll take care of everything.

02:17.200 --> 02:18.260
It's going to be expensive.

02:18.270 --> 02:19.270
There's some people

02:19.270 --> 02:20.470
I'm going to have to pay off.

02:20.470 --> 02:22.200
You got to come up
with your share.

02:24.340 --> 02:26.340
How much is my share
gonna be?

02:26.340 --> 02:29.040
Fifty. Sixty thousand.

02:29.040 --> 02:31.480
Come on, Wade! You know
I don't have that kind of money!

02:31.480 --> 02:32.980
That's why you can't quit.

02:32.980 --> 02:35.150
You got to keep fightin'
till I recoup all the money

02:35.150 --> 02:36.920
I'm going to have
to lay out for this.

02:36.920 --> 02:40.790
Now, I've got fights lined up
all over this country.

02:40.790 --> 02:42.560
After a year...

02:42.560 --> 02:44.730
you can walk away.

02:44.730 --> 02:47.330
Just be thankful
I'm giving you an out.

02:48.300 --> 02:49.500
Yeah.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.470
Yeah, right.

02:51.470 --> 02:53.470
(<i> tense theme playing</i> )

02:59.940 --> 03:00.940
Where is he?

03:00.940 --> 03:02.380
He's in the car.

03:08.120 --> 03:10.080
So how'd I do?

03:10.090 --> 03:11.590
( engine starts )
You did great, Lyle.

03:11.590 --> 03:13.520
When do I get paid?

03:13.520 --> 03:15.360
Right away.

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000

04:54.290 --> 04:55.360
Mr. and Mrs. Larue?

04:55.360 --> 04:56.690
Yes, sir.
That's us.

04:56.690 --> 04:57.790
I'm Ranger Walker,

04:57.790 --> 04:59.260
and this is
Ranger Trivette.
Howdy.

04:59.260 --> 05:00.630
Could you tell us
where the body is?

05:00.630 --> 05:03.030
It's right over there.

05:03.030 --> 05:04.460
Covered with brush.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.600
We didn't touch anything,

05:05.600 --> 05:06.600
you understand.

05:06.600 --> 05:08.240
I know about these things.

05:08.240 --> 05:10.370
I watch a lot of them murder
mysteries on television.

05:10.370 --> 05:13.770
Lucky thing we had to stop,
or we'd of missed it.

05:13.780 --> 05:16.010
I sometimes get
a little carsick,

05:16.010 --> 05:17.840
and Virgil
has to pull over.

05:17.850 --> 05:19.480
You're all right now, ma'am?

05:19.480 --> 05:21.420
Uh, yeah, thanks.

05:21.420 --> 05:22.920
Would you folks please,
uh, wait here?

05:41.800 --> 05:44.840
Doesn't look like
he's been dead long.

05:49.010 --> 05:50.740
He's 220.

05:54.080 --> 05:55.220
Six-one.

05:55.220 --> 05:58.280
Okay, watch out.

06:03.490 --> 06:05.360
Looks like somebody used him
for a punching bag.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.060
TRIVETTE:
Any wounds?

06:09.970 --> 06:11.300
I don't see any.

06:13.070 --> 06:14.230
What the heck?

06:14.240 --> 06:16.140
Trivette, look at this.

06:16.140 --> 06:18.100
You ever seen
anything like that?

06:18.110 --> 06:20.270
Not unless you want to count
the gladiator scene

06:20.280 --> 06:21.270
in <i> Spartacus.</i>

06:21.280 --> 06:22.280
<i> Spartacus?</i>

06:22.280 --> 06:23.810
Yeah,<i> Spartacus.</i>

06:26.080 --> 06:28.650
Okay, let's contact
Forensics

06:28.650 --> 06:31.620
and get a medical examiner
out here right away.

06:31.620 --> 06:33.520
I want an autopsy
on him.

06:33.520 --> 06:34.690
Gotcha.

06:34.690 --> 06:37.060
You're too young
to remember <i> Spartacus.</i>

06:37.060 --> 06:38.630
I rented the video.

06:38.630 --> 06:39.630
Oh.

06:41.430 --> 06:44.100
This guy had been
in a lot of fights.

06:44.100 --> 06:47.500
The autopsy reports show
that he had a concussion,

06:47.500 --> 06:48.740
broken bones,

06:48.740 --> 06:50.440
and even organ damage.

06:50.440 --> 06:51.870
Is that what
killed him?

06:51.870 --> 06:53.410
Well, we thought so
at first.

06:53.410 --> 06:54.780
But the toxicology
reports show

06:54.780 --> 06:56.910
that he died of an overdose
of morphine.

06:56.910 --> 06:57.910
Well...

07:00.280 --> 07:01.420
Suicide?

07:01.420 --> 07:03.550
Well, let's think
about this, Alex.

07:03.550 --> 07:06.220
A guy hitchhikes
all the way out to nowhere,

07:06.220 --> 07:08.560
then he kills himself,

07:08.560 --> 07:10.460
and then he covers
himself up with brush.

07:12.360 --> 07:13.360
Good point.

07:14.360 --> 07:16.030
Well, are you any closer
on his identity?

07:16.030 --> 07:17.530
We're running prints
on him right now,

07:17.530 --> 07:18.530
but so far, nothing.

07:18.530 --> 07:19.730
( bell rings )

07:19.730 --> 07:21.200
Well, I'll be in court
most of the day,

07:21.200 --> 07:22.470
but you let me know
what happens.

07:22.470 --> 07:23.740
Will do.

07:29.480 --> 07:30.510
MAN:
That's right, ma'am.

07:38.050 --> 07:39.050
Jimmy?

07:39.050 --> 07:40.050
Yeah?

07:41.520 --> 07:42.520
Hi.

07:42.520 --> 07:43.520
( chuckles nervously )

07:50.000 --> 07:51.460
Diane, hi.

07:52.500 --> 07:54.870
Well, it's been
a long time.

07:54.870 --> 07:56.800
Life's been good?

08:00.340 --> 08:01.410
It's been okay.

08:03.580 --> 08:05.680
Uh, look, can we talk?
It's important.

08:07.220 --> 08:08.250
Yeah, sure.

08:12.990 --> 08:13.990
Thanks.

08:17.490 --> 08:18.490
You look good too.

08:18.490 --> 08:20.490
( sighing ):
Thank you.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.400
It's about Randy.

08:22.400 --> 08:24.360
I'm afraid for him.

08:24.370 --> 08:26.770
He's, um--
He's been drinking,

08:26.770 --> 08:28.570
and it looks like he's been

08:28.570 --> 08:30.170
in fights or something.

08:30.170 --> 08:32.270
I don't know, something bad's
going on with him.

08:32.270 --> 08:33.409
You know, after all this time,

08:33.409 --> 08:34.809
and you come to me for this.

08:34.809 --> 08:36.440
Look, this has nothing to do

08:36.440 --> 08:38.380
with what happened
between us, okay?

08:38.380 --> 08:40.580
I came to you
because you're his friend.

08:40.580 --> 08:41.980
He idolizes you.

08:41.980 --> 08:43.950
You know, I didn't even know
you were living here.

08:43.950 --> 08:45.180
Well, I don't,

08:45.190 --> 08:46.950
I came out from Chicago
because I was worried.

08:46.960 --> 08:48.120
He wouldn't
answer his phone.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.560
Look, I practically
had to beg him

08:49.560 --> 08:51.190
to get him to see me.

08:51.190 --> 08:52.460
Jimmy, he's a mess.

08:52.460 --> 08:54.460
I wouldn't have
come here if he wasn't.

08:55.660 --> 08:58.030
Look, this isn't easy
for me either.

08:58.030 --> 08:59.370
Okay, Diane.

08:59.370 --> 09:01.430
All right,
where does he live?

09:05.110 --> 09:07.010
WALKER:
You wanna tell me
what this is all about?

09:07.010 --> 09:08.510
I told you,
I played football with him.

09:08.510 --> 09:09.840
We were buddies.

09:09.840 --> 09:11.080
So all this
for an old buddy?

09:11.080 --> 09:12.480
What difference does it--

09:12.480 --> 09:15.120
Look, we're gonna be
outta here before you know it.

09:17.650 --> 09:18.950
Randy, you in here?

09:21.090 --> 09:22.090
Randy?

09:22.090 --> 09:23.590
( door squeaks )

09:38.940 --> 09:39.940
Wake up, man.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.380
Jim?

09:45.380 --> 09:46.380
In the flesh.

09:47.950 --> 09:49.780
Oh, man,
what time is it?

09:51.090 --> 09:52.520
It's a quarter
after 5.

09:52.520 --> 09:53.590
In the morning?

09:53.590 --> 09:54.850
No, the morning's
come and gone.

09:54.860 --> 09:56.390
We're talking about
the afternoon.

10:03.370 --> 10:05.430
Texas Ranger now, huh?

10:05.430 --> 10:06.600
Yeah.

10:06.600 --> 10:07.930
Been a long time.

10:09.970 --> 10:11.170
Who's he?

10:11.170 --> 10:12.510
He's my friend.

10:13.570 --> 10:15.380
You always did
have a lot of friends.

10:17.150 --> 10:18.140
Hey...

10:20.480 --> 10:22.520
What's goin' on with you?

10:22.520 --> 10:23.920
Huh? Look at this place.

10:23.920 --> 10:25.180
I had to fire
all my servants.

10:25.190 --> 10:26.190
You know, good help

10:26.190 --> 10:27.790
really is hard to find.

10:31.960 --> 10:33.590
My sister send you here?

10:33.600 --> 10:34.830
She's worried about you.

10:36.370 --> 10:38.160
Well, that's real sweet,
but, uh...

10:38.170 --> 10:39.830
she's got nothing
to worry about.

10:39.840 --> 10:40.830
I'm doin' just fine.

10:41.870 --> 10:42.870
I can see that.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.310
What are you?
Mother Teresa now, huh?

10:47.310 --> 10:48.540
Hey.

10:48.540 --> 10:49.540
Ah.

10:50.950 --> 10:52.880
Well, I got
a date tonight,

10:52.880 --> 10:55.780
so, uh, I'm just gonna
jump in the shower,

10:55.780 --> 10:57.120
change my clothes.

10:57.120 --> 10:58.750
You and I,

10:58.750 --> 11:01.290
we can get caught up
some other time, okay?

11:02.420 --> 11:04.790
Randy, where'd you
get that--?

11:04.790 --> 11:06.430
The man's right,
Trivette.

11:06.430 --> 11:07.490
Let's go.

11:07.500 --> 11:09.260
I didn't catch your name.

11:09.260 --> 11:10.700
Walker.

11:10.700 --> 11:12.930
Yeah, well, I--
I appreciate it, Walker.

11:12.930 --> 11:14.070
No problem.

11:14.070 --> 11:15.070
You guys can catch up

11:15.070 --> 11:16.540
some other time.

11:21.410 --> 11:23.610
I'm gonna
call you, Randy.

11:23.610 --> 11:24.780
Well, I'll be here.

11:29.450 --> 11:30.720
That X might have
nothing to do

11:30.720 --> 11:32.120
with the killing,
you know.

11:35.560 --> 11:36.560
I know, I know.

11:36.560 --> 11:39.120
It's a hell
of a coincidence.

11:39.130 --> 11:40.890
How well
do you know him?

11:42.330 --> 11:44.300
Pretty good.

11:44.300 --> 11:47.630
We used to be roomies
when we were playing ball.

11:47.640 --> 11:51.300
He got cut a couple of years
after I busted my shoulder.

11:54.780 --> 11:55.770
And?

12:00.280 --> 12:01.280
He's got this sister.

12:01.280 --> 12:03.080
We used to have
this thing going,

12:03.080 --> 12:05.550
but after I got hurt,
she bailed on me.

12:06.690 --> 12:07.690
She disappeared.

12:12.630 --> 12:14.730
At the time
there was a lot of pain.

12:17.530 --> 12:18.730
How 'bout now?

12:22.940 --> 12:26.670
I guess there's still
a lot of pain.

12:26.680 --> 12:27.670
You know?

12:32.650 --> 12:36.080
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

12:36.080 --> 12:37.750
WALKER:
What is this?

12:44.060 --> 12:45.890
Let's follow him.

That's near here.

We'll take it.

12:52.930 --> 12:54.330
What about Randy?

12:54.340 --> 12:55.700
We know where he lives.

13:05.750 --> 13:08.250
(<i> synthesizer theme playing</i> )

13:16.760 --> 13:19.090
Oh, hi. I tried
to reach you by phone.

13:19.090 --> 13:20.890
I couldn't get you.
I thought I'd wait here.

13:22.630 --> 13:23.660
One of our guys got shot,

13:23.660 --> 13:25.060
so we had to take him
to the hospital.

13:25.070 --> 13:27.070
That's awful.
Is he okay?

13:27.070 --> 13:29.870
Lost a lot of blood,
but he's gonna be okay.

13:29.870 --> 13:30.870
Good.

13:32.610 --> 13:34.210
We saw Randy right before
we got the call.

13:34.210 --> 13:36.210
You're right. There's something
goin' on with him,

13:36.210 --> 13:37.540
but I don't know
what it is, Diane.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.510
'Cause he wouldn't
talk to me.

13:39.510 --> 13:40.650
What are you
gonna do?

13:40.650 --> 13:42.820
What do you want me to do?
I'm a cop.

13:42.820 --> 13:44.350
I didn't come here
because you're a cop.

13:44.350 --> 13:45.720
I came because
you're a friend.

13:45.720 --> 13:47.620
Whose?
Randy's or yours?

13:47.620 --> 13:49.660
Okay...

13:49.660 --> 13:52.290
Okay, Jimmy, let's put
it all on the table.

13:52.290 --> 13:53.560
Yeah, let's do that.

13:53.560 --> 13:56.430
After you got hurt,
you went off the deep end,

13:56.430 --> 13:57.630
and I got scared.

13:57.630 --> 13:59.430
Look, Diane, what happened
to me back then--

13:59.430 --> 14:01.300
And maybe I should've been
more mature about it.

14:01.300 --> 14:02.570
Maybe I should've
hung in there.

14:02.570 --> 14:04.040
But it got to be
too much for me.

14:04.670 --> 14:06.110
If I made a mistake,

14:06.110 --> 14:07.970
if I hurt you,

14:07.980 --> 14:10.310
I'm sorry.

14:10.310 --> 14:12.380
You wanna punish me?
Fine.

14:12.380 --> 14:14.010
But don't use
my brother to do it.

14:14.020 --> 14:15.920
Hey, nobod--

14:15.920 --> 14:18.550
Nobody's using Randy
for anything.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.390
Yeah, he's into something.

14:24.390 --> 14:25.390
We're not sure
what it is,

14:25.390 --> 14:27.090
but it's serious.

14:27.090 --> 14:28.090
How serious?

14:30.100 --> 14:31.200
I can't tell you
right now.

14:31.200 --> 14:33.300
You're gonna have to--
( phone rings )

14:33.300 --> 14:34.770
You're just gonna
have to trust us.

14:34.770 --> 14:35.770
Trivette.

14:38.710 --> 14:39.710
Spell it.

14:43.040 --> 14:44.040
Okay, where?

14:45.650 --> 14:47.350
You guys do good work.
Thanks.

14:47.350 --> 14:49.180
Walker.
That's Fingerprinting.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.320
They got a make
on our John Doe.

14:53.220 --> 14:55.590
Diane Warren,
Cordell Walker.

14:55.590 --> 14:56.690
Hi, Diane.
Nice to meet you.

14:56.690 --> 14:57.720
Nice to meet you.

14:57.730 --> 14:59.490
Two years ago, he did
18 months at county,

14:59.490 --> 15:00.490
and they got the--

15:00.500 --> 15:01.590
They got the prints
on file.

15:01.600 --> 15:02.960
His name's Lyle Ganz.

15:04.200 --> 15:05.230
Do you know
where he lives?

15:05.230 --> 15:07.300
Yeah, lives out in Denton
with his dad.

15:08.840 --> 15:10.870
Well, I better get out there
and break the news to him.

15:10.870 --> 15:11.870
You wanna go?

15:13.710 --> 15:15.680
Yeah. I gotta go.

15:15.680 --> 15:16.680
All right?

15:18.280 --> 15:19.280
Nice meeting you.

15:19.280 --> 15:20.280
Nice meeting you.

15:22.180 --> 15:23.180
( sighs )

15:26.990 --> 15:29.090
WALKER:
Sorry we had to break this
to you, Mr. Ganz.

15:29.090 --> 15:30.090
( horse whinnies )

15:30.090 --> 15:31.520
( dog barking )

15:31.530 --> 15:33.130
Well...

15:33.130 --> 15:35.760
Comes as no surprise,
if that's any comfort.

15:35.760 --> 15:37.230
I always knew
this would happen.

15:37.230 --> 15:39.200
Just glad his mother
never lived to see it.

15:39.200 --> 15:41.470
Do you have any idea
who would wanna kill him?

15:41.470 --> 15:43.970
Pick a number, Ranger.

15:43.970 --> 15:47.040
He hung out with a rowdy lot.

15:47.040 --> 15:48.710
They used to beat
the hell out of each other,

15:48.710 --> 15:50.740
just for the sport.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.450
I figure it could
be any one of 'em.

15:52.450 --> 15:53.610
You have any names?

15:53.620 --> 15:56.050
I never wanted to get
that familiar with 'em.

15:56.050 --> 15:58.650
When you say hung out,
do you know where?

15:58.650 --> 16:00.790
Sure, I know where.

16:00.790 --> 16:03.220
He'd come back
all bloody and bruised.

16:03.220 --> 16:06.060
Said he had a great time.

16:06.060 --> 16:08.560
Place called
the Bare Knuckles.

16:23.780 --> 16:25.080
Bare Knuckles.

16:25.080 --> 16:27.350
That sounds like a place doctors
and accountants hang out.

16:27.350 --> 16:29.150
Yeah, absolutely.

16:30.450 --> 16:32.880
Let's not let 'em
know who we are.

16:32.890 --> 16:34.390
See what
we can find out.

16:36.090 --> 16:37.820
What are we gonna
do about Randy?

16:37.830 --> 16:40.060
You tell me.

16:40.060 --> 16:41.090
I guess
if he's involved,

16:41.100 --> 16:43.300
he's gonna have
to answer for it.

16:43.300 --> 16:45.930
Couldn't have said it
better myself.

16:45.930 --> 16:47.170
Cord, do you think
we can do this

16:47.170 --> 16:49.840
without breakin' anything?

16:49.840 --> 16:50.840
I'll do my best.

16:54.210 --> 16:55.880
That's reassuring.

16:55.880 --> 16:59.110
( country music playing over
radio )

17:01.880 --> 17:03.220
BARTENDER:
What can I get for you?

17:05.089 --> 17:06.950
We need some information.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.319
Don't serve information.
Just beer.

17:09.319 --> 17:10.319
Two longnecks.

17:14.560 --> 17:15.660
Pay him, Trivette.

17:22.170 --> 17:23.170
( clears throat )

17:27.109 --> 17:28.339
Have anything smaller?

17:28.339 --> 17:29.340
No.

17:29.340 --> 17:30.340
Keep the change.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.040
We still need information.

17:34.010 --> 17:36.680
I guess I can
make an exception.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.750
There's a guy
that hangs out here

17:38.750 --> 17:39.990
by the name of Lyle Ganz.

17:39.990 --> 17:42.960
BARTENDER:
Ganz used to
hang out here.

17:42.960 --> 17:44.690
He doesn't anymore.

17:44.690 --> 17:46.290
Well, you get
the word to him.

17:46.290 --> 17:47.730
I want the money
he owes me,

17:47.730 --> 17:49.560
or I'm gonna take it
out of his hide.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.500
Lyle Ganz
is one tough guy,

17:52.500 --> 17:53.500
cowboy.

17:54.840 --> 17:55.900
Is that right?

17:56.870 --> 17:57.870
Well, I'm tougher.

17:57.870 --> 17:59.770
Oh, is that right?

17:59.770 --> 18:01.570
You're not supposed
to do that.

18:03.140 --> 18:04.280
And who are you?

18:04.280 --> 18:05.610
I'm just the guy
that's here to see

18:05.610 --> 18:08.310
that the damage
is kept to a minimum.

18:08.320 --> 18:10.250
You see, what happens
is, when you do that,

18:10.250 --> 18:11.750
he gets very upset.

18:11.750 --> 18:14.220
And you're not gonna like it
when he gets upset.

18:14.220 --> 18:15.220
No, foolin'.

18:15.220 --> 18:16.320
Scout's honor.

18:17.460 --> 18:19.460
Well, my, my, my,

18:19.460 --> 18:20.760
I'm just dyi''
of curiosity.

18:21.660 --> 18:22.660
I tried.

18:26.630 --> 18:27.670
MAN:
Come on! Get him!

18:28.600 --> 18:29.600
What the hell
was that?

18:29.600 --> 18:30.600
This.

18:33.370 --> 18:34.370
( grunts )

18:39.880 --> 18:40.880
MAN 2:
You see that?

18:43.020 --> 18:44.050
Ah.

18:44.050 --> 18:45.050
That's for the damages.

18:45.890 --> 18:46.890
Get a hold of Ganz

18:46.890 --> 18:48.990
because I'm gonna be back.

18:59.570 --> 19:01.070
So now what?

19:01.070 --> 19:02.870
Let's see if I made
a good impression.

19:02.870 --> 19:04.070
I think you did.

19:04.070 --> 19:05.500
Hey, tough guy.

19:06.810 --> 19:08.210
Holy mackerel.

19:08.210 --> 19:10.210
If there's a fight,
you want some help?

19:10.210 --> 19:11.580
If there's a fight,

19:11.580 --> 19:13.450
I'd rather you'd take care
of it all by yourself.

19:15.180 --> 19:16.820
Hey, you're
pretty good.

19:16.820 --> 19:18.020
Like to fight?

19:18.020 --> 19:19.820
Yeah, I like
to fight. Why?

19:19.820 --> 19:21.150
How 'bout
for some money?

19:21.160 --> 19:22.150
How much?

19:22.160 --> 19:23.960
That depends on
how good you are.

19:23.960 --> 19:26.190
Could be a way to get back
what Ganz owed ya.

19:26.190 --> 19:28.560
Interested?

19:28.560 --> 19:29.760
Yeah. Keep talking.

19:29.760 --> 19:32.270
Come back tonight.
Ten o'clock.

19:32.270 --> 19:34.200
You'll find out then.

19:34.200 --> 19:35.330
Ten o'clock it is.

19:43.880 --> 19:44.880
I got it.

19:45.680 --> 19:46.750
Yeah, I'll let him know.

19:52.350 --> 19:56.490
Bare Knuckles is owned
by Wade Cantrell Enterprises.

19:56.490 --> 19:57.790
And Wade Cantrell Enterprises

19:57.790 --> 20:00.130
also owns the limo
that picked up Randy.

20:01.200 --> 20:03.560
What else
does he do?

20:03.560 --> 20:06.000
Land development,
shopping centers,

20:06.000 --> 20:07.400
apartment buildings.

20:08.600 --> 20:09.600
And fighting.

20:10.240 --> 20:11.900
A real entrepreneur.

20:12.810 --> 20:13.810
It's quarter after.

20:14.940 --> 20:16.340
Think they're
gonna show?

20:16.340 --> 20:17.340
They'll show.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.390
I'm Wade Cantrell.

20:32.390 --> 20:33.390
Climb in.

20:44.640 --> 20:46.170
I didn't
get your names.

20:46.170 --> 20:48.410
I'm Frick. He's Frack.

20:48.410 --> 20:50.140
That's very funny.

20:50.140 --> 20:51.880
You know, we don't have
to do this.

20:51.880 --> 20:53.280
It can end right here.

20:53.280 --> 20:56.220
Look, bud, all I wanna do
is get my money back.

20:56.220 --> 20:58.320
Let's get
somethin' straight.

20:58.320 --> 21:00.390
I don't know
where Ganz is,

21:00.390 --> 21:02.020
and I don't care.

21:02.020 --> 21:03.760
This about fightin'
for money.

21:03.760 --> 21:04.760
You game?

21:04.760 --> 21:06.330
That's why
we're here.

21:06.330 --> 21:08.030
Okay.

21:08.030 --> 21:09.030
Put these on.

21:09.960 --> 21:10.960
Why?

21:12.270 --> 21:14.800
'Cause I have some very
important people to protect.

21:14.800 --> 21:16.540
I don't want you to know
where you're going.

21:16.540 --> 21:18.570
It's the only way
this is going to work.

21:20.310 --> 21:22.410
( sighs )

21:23.980 --> 21:25.210
WADE:
Frick and Frack.

21:25.210 --> 21:27.650
Sounds like
a vaudeville team.

21:27.650 --> 21:30.350
You oughta
see us dance.

21:30.350 --> 21:33.320
( crowd shouting and cheering )

21:53.910 --> 21:56.080
No referee.
No rounds.

21:57.810 --> 21:59.850
Last man standing wins.

21:59.850 --> 22:01.150
You think you're
up to it?

22:01.150 --> 22:02.150
For how much?

22:02.150 --> 22:03.720
Sky's the limit.

22:03.720 --> 22:05.690
All depends
on how good you are.

22:05.690 --> 22:07.850
Yeah, sure.

22:12.690 --> 22:14.390
And you?

22:15.460 --> 22:17.030
I'll sit this one out.

22:33.980 --> 22:36.310
He's the champ.

22:36.320 --> 22:37.750
He's the best there is.

22:39.520 --> 22:42.020
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

23:01.540 --> 23:02.940
Is this really
necessary?

23:02.940 --> 23:04.310
Hey, it's gotta be.

23:04.310 --> 23:06.350
Bets are placed
on the colors.

23:06.350 --> 23:09.310
A lot of money
changes hands.

23:09.320 --> 23:10.880
Did Lyle Ganz
fight for Cantrell?

23:10.890 --> 23:12.920
What do you think?

23:14.420 --> 23:16.320
That guy fighting
when we came in, he's good.

23:16.320 --> 23:18.590
Randy? Oh, yeah.

23:18.590 --> 23:20.160
He's Cantrell's main moneymaker.

23:20.160 --> 23:21.730
He and Ganz ever fight?

23:21.730 --> 23:24.400
You know, for someone
who don't wanna fight,

23:24.400 --> 23:26.830
you ask an awful lot
of questions.

23:26.830 --> 23:28.930
I fight.
I just pick my times.

23:28.940 --> 23:30.400
You know,
maybe now's the time.

23:31.940 --> 23:33.770
Hey, make a move, pal.

23:33.780 --> 23:34.770
WALKER:
All right!

23:35.540 --> 23:36.580
Fight's out there.

23:37.710 --> 23:39.410
He's ready for him.

23:39.410 --> 23:40.550
All right, let's go.

23:44.790 --> 23:46.420
Try to find Randy.

23:46.420 --> 23:48.050
Are you gonna be
all right?

23:48.060 --> 23:49.790
( sarcastically ):
Now's a good time to ask.

23:52.630 --> 23:54.290
Ladies and gentlemen,

23:54.290 --> 23:55.460
fight fans,

23:55.460 --> 23:56.460
for your entertainment

23:56.460 --> 23:58.760
and betting pleasure,

23:58.770 --> 24:00.600
we have a new fighter
for you tonight.

24:00.600 --> 24:02.000
And here he is.

24:02.000 --> 24:03.270
The black X!

24:03.270 --> 24:06.840
( crowd cheering )

24:09.910 --> 24:11.910
I'd bet big on him.

24:11.910 --> 24:13.010
He's tough.

24:14.950 --> 24:16.850
As you all know,

24:16.850 --> 24:19.550
there are no rules,
except to win.

24:20.320 --> 24:21.550
Let's get it on!

24:21.560 --> 24:23.490
( crowd cheers )

24:33.430 --> 24:35.130
( horse whinnies )

24:44.450 --> 24:45.440
Hey, Randy.

24:50.920 --> 24:51.920
Hey, man,
what are you--?

24:51.920 --> 24:52.950
What are you
doin' here?

24:52.950 --> 24:54.220
Nice fight.

24:56.990 --> 24:58.620
Yeah, well, that's none
of your business.

24:58.630 --> 25:00.190
It is my business.

25:00.190 --> 25:01.290
I'm tryin'
to save your ass.

25:01.300 --> 25:02.690
Hey, listen, it's none
of your--

25:02.700 --> 25:04.530
Hey, man!

25:04.530 --> 25:05.960
Look, I'm a Texas Ranger.

25:05.970 --> 25:07.370
You got that?

25:07.370 --> 25:09.100
You tell me
what you're into,

25:09.100 --> 25:10.200
and don't give me any jive

25:10.200 --> 25:12.300
about it being
some stupid sporting event.

25:12.310 --> 25:13.310
Hey, look--

25:13.310 --> 25:14.610
I saw you, Randy.

25:16.480 --> 25:17.480
Okay.

25:22.750 --> 25:24.520
I'm in some
deep trouble, man.

25:24.520 --> 25:25.520
Yeah.

25:29.990 --> 25:31.960
I think
I killed someone.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.030
Lyle Ganz.

25:33.030 --> 25:34.030
You know about that?

25:34.030 --> 25:35.030
Yeah, I know about that.

25:35.030 --> 25:36.030
It was
an accident, man.

25:36.030 --> 25:37.030
Randy, don't--

25:37.030 --> 25:38.760
Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy,
we fought,

25:38.770 --> 25:40.830
and, uh, I didn't think
I hurt him that bad.

25:40.830 --> 25:42.170
I didn't think
I hit him that hard.

25:42.170 --> 25:43.400
Man, I'm telling you.

25:49.040 --> 25:50.780
That's what they told you?

25:50.780 --> 25:51.780
Yeah.

25:55.950 --> 25:58.120
Man, you didn't
kill Ganz.

25:58.120 --> 25:59.920
Not unless you hit him
with morphine.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.920
Morphine? Morphine?
What are you saying, man?

26:01.920 --> 26:03.860
I'm saying somebody
injected Ganz

26:03.860 --> 26:05.690
with enough morphine
to kill his whole family.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.930
Now, what do you
know about that?

26:10.430 --> 26:11.430
( sighs )

26:12.770 --> 26:13.770
Oh, man.

26:13.770 --> 26:14.770
Cantrell.

26:15.740 --> 26:17.100
Come on, Randy.

26:17.100 --> 26:18.100
That son of a--

26:19.210 --> 26:20.240
Man, he killed a man

26:20.240 --> 26:22.210
just so I'd keep
fightin' for him.

26:25.010 --> 26:26.610
I'm nothing but
a damn money machine

26:26.610 --> 26:27.750
to him, man.

26:28.620 --> 26:30.550
Okay, look, Jimmy,

26:30.550 --> 26:33.250
things were hard for me,
man, real hard.

26:33.250 --> 26:34.720
And I mean,
I was goin' no place.

26:34.720 --> 26:36.090
I needed a way to--

26:36.090 --> 26:37.620
To make a living.

26:38.790 --> 26:41.430
One night, uh, I had
a fight in this bar.

26:41.430 --> 26:43.600
Cantrell was there,
and he saw me.

26:43.600 --> 26:45.900
He asked me if I wanted
to fight for him.

26:45.900 --> 26:47.400
Now, this is a way
for me to get back

26:47.400 --> 26:49.300
to where I need
to be, Jimmy!

26:49.300 --> 26:52.070
I figured I could--
I could do it for a while,

26:52.070 --> 26:54.740
and then I could
just walk away.

26:55.740 --> 26:56.740
Like Ganz.

26:56.740 --> 26:58.340
Yeah.

26:59.650 --> 27:01.250
Like Ganz.

27:01.250 --> 27:02.250
Then this.

27:05.990 --> 27:08.850
What do you
expect me to do, man?

27:11.790 --> 27:14.030
You gotta let us
handle this.

27:22.800 --> 27:24.570
Be cool, Randy.

27:31.880 --> 27:33.480
( grunts )

27:43.320 --> 27:44.620
You okay, partner?

27:45.530 --> 27:47.130
( groans )

27:49.960 --> 27:51.360
( cheering intensifies )

28:01.580 --> 28:03.080
( crowd applauding )

28:06.980 --> 28:09.110
Where you going?

28:09.120 --> 28:10.720
The fight's over.

28:10.720 --> 28:13.180
It's not over
till I say it is.

28:23.760 --> 28:26.030
I say it's over.

28:26.030 --> 28:27.500
( cheering and applauding )

28:31.510 --> 28:33.100
You're a hell
of a fighter,

28:33.110 --> 28:34.610
but you're
too soft.

28:35.310 --> 28:36.310
No one's perfect.

28:38.810 --> 28:41.180
I'd still like to make
some money with you.

28:41.180 --> 28:43.850
Your buddy. If he
isn't willing to fight,

28:43.850 --> 28:44.980
I don't want him around.

28:44.990 --> 28:46.750
I'll talk him
into it. When?

28:46.750 --> 28:48.650
Tomorrow night.
Eleven o'clock.

28:48.660 --> 28:50.320
We'll give you
the directions.

28:50.320 --> 28:52.060
You got it.

28:52.060 --> 28:53.060
Let's go.

28:53.860 --> 28:54.860
Talk me into what?

28:54.860 --> 28:56.100
I'll tell you later.

29:00.830 --> 29:03.400
Take them back
to their car,

29:03.400 --> 29:04.870
then follow them.

29:04.870 --> 29:06.370
I wanna know
where they go.

29:24.220 --> 29:25.920
What'd you
say to them?

29:25.930 --> 29:28.290
I said you were going
to fight tomorrow night.

29:28.300 --> 29:30.700
You could have at least
asked me first.

29:30.700 --> 29:33.570
We're not going
to fight tomorrow night.

29:33.570 --> 29:36.170
We're not gonna
fight tomorrow night?

29:36.170 --> 29:38.140
I said we're not going
to fight tomorrow night.

29:38.140 --> 29:39.940
We're gonna bust him
tomorrow night.

29:56.320 --> 29:58.760
You should be resting up
for tonight.

29:58.760 --> 29:59.990
There's not
gonna be a tonight

29:59.990 --> 30:02.230
'cause I'm not fighting
for you anymore.

30:02.230 --> 30:04.400
What about Lyle Ganz?

30:04.400 --> 30:06.060
I didn't kill Ganz.

30:06.070 --> 30:08.970
I found out he died
from an overdose of morphine.

30:08.970 --> 30:11.600
Now, I'm not gonna
say anything to anybody,

30:11.610 --> 30:12.600
but I'm through.

30:12.610 --> 30:14.170
Don't be an idiot.

30:14.170 --> 30:15.940
I got fights lined up
all over the place.

30:15.940 --> 30:16.980
You can make big money.

30:16.980 --> 30:18.380
Do it with somebody else.

30:18.380 --> 30:19.380
It's over, Wade.

30:20.150 --> 30:21.580
You're sure?

30:21.580 --> 30:23.080
Nothing's gonna change my mind.

30:24.020 --> 30:25.780
Good luck, kid.

30:25.790 --> 30:27.290
You were the best.

30:30.860 --> 30:33.620
You gonna let him
just walk away?

30:33.630 --> 30:34.890
He'll be back.

30:42.700 --> 30:44.700
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

30:50.910 --> 30:52.480
You Randy Warren's
sister?

30:53.250 --> 30:54.280
Yeah.

30:54.280 --> 30:55.650
He sent us over
to pick you up.

30:55.650 --> 30:57.120
He's in some trouble.

30:57.120 --> 30:58.620
What kind of trouble?

30:58.620 --> 31:00.520
Come on, get in.
We'll take you to him.

31:01.890 --> 31:03.720
Um, well, why don't you
tell me where he is,

31:03.720 --> 31:04.990
and I'll-- I'll meet you there.

31:04.990 --> 31:07.230
There's no time.
Come on, get in.

31:08.560 --> 31:10.860

31:10.860 --> 31:12.700
(<i> fast rock theme playing</i> )

31:35.620 --> 31:36.960
Hey.

31:38.390 --> 31:39.390
How's it goin'?

31:39.390 --> 31:40.890
Fine.

31:40.900 --> 31:42.390
Gettin' ready
for tonight, huh?

31:43.630 --> 31:45.000
I'm always ready.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.070
You know,
I'm a good fighter.

31:48.070 --> 31:49.570
I know you are.

31:52.270 --> 31:54.340
Wanna go a couple rounds?

31:54.340 --> 31:55.470
I could use a workout.

31:55.480 --> 31:57.240
Are you saying
you wanna spar with me?

31:57.240 --> 31:59.340
Oh...yeah, okay.

31:59.350 --> 32:00.810
I know you're
a kickboxing champion,

32:02.120 --> 32:04.550
but that was 15 years ago.

32:04.550 --> 32:06.980
Yeah, you're right.

32:06.990 --> 32:08.150
I am over the hill.

32:09.890 --> 32:11.290
All right,
but take it easy on me.

32:13.390 --> 32:14.760
Carlos.
Yeah?

32:14.760 --> 32:16.800
Can I borrow
your equipment for Trivette?

32:22.670 --> 32:23.970
Here, Bill,
put that on him.

32:24.770 --> 32:25.800
And the headgear.

32:25.810 --> 32:27.340
I'm gonna float
like a butterfly,

32:27.340 --> 32:28.540
sting like a bee!

32:31.850 --> 32:33.410
I want you, Walker!

32:33.410 --> 32:34.710
Let me at him.

32:36.820 --> 32:38.280
All right.

32:38.290 --> 32:39.350
Where's your headgear?

32:39.350 --> 32:40.350
I don't need it.

32:40.350 --> 32:41.490
Then I don't
need this, if--

32:41.490 --> 32:43.190
Okay, okay.
Carlos?

32:52.600 --> 32:54.300
There. Better?

32:54.300 --> 32:55.900
Better.

32:55.900 --> 32:57.740
Wait. National
or international rules?

32:57.740 --> 32:58.900
What's the difference?

32:58.910 --> 33:00.570
International rules,
you can kick the leg.

33:00.570 --> 33:01.870
Fine with me.

33:01.880 --> 33:03.040
Okay.

33:18.160 --> 33:19.160
Ow! God.

33:20.730 --> 33:21.890
Damn, that hurt.

33:21.900 --> 33:23.430
You okay?
Yeah.
I'm all right.

33:36.780 --> 33:37.780
Oh!

33:40.110 --> 33:41.510
Let's do national rules.

33:41.520 --> 33:42.510
Okay.

34:13.909 --> 34:14.909
Aw!

34:15.719 --> 34:16.820
Hey, you all right?

34:16.820 --> 34:17.820
Yeah, I'm all right.

34:17.820 --> 34:18.850
Sure?

34:18.850 --> 34:20.150
Yeah, I'm okay.
I'm okay.

34:24.730 --> 34:26.389
Let me take
that glove off ya.

34:26.389 --> 34:27.389
There you go.

34:31.929 --> 34:32.929
Actually...

34:34.570 --> 34:36.400
wrestling's my forte.

34:36.400 --> 34:38.040
I was Penn State champion.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.040
You mean now
you wanna wrestle?

34:40.040 --> 34:41.909
( panting )
Yeah.

34:41.909 --> 34:44.139
Well, remember,
I'm over the hill,

34:44.139 --> 34:45.310
so take it easy on me.

34:45.310 --> 34:46.980
Okay, now...

34:46.980 --> 34:48.580
if it gets to be
too much,

34:48.580 --> 34:51.020
just pat the old mat
three times.

34:51.020 --> 34:52.880
Tap three times.
Got it.

34:52.889 --> 34:54.650
Let me get
these off.

34:57.220 --> 34:58.220
All right.

35:55.120 --> 35:56.780

I'm through.

Yeah, well,
what's it to ya?

She's safe...for now.

36:44.100 --> 36:45.100
You hurt her--

36:45.100 --> 36:46.460
And you'll do what?

36:47.200 --> 36:49.830
I'll kill you both.

36:49.840 --> 36:51.740
They'll never
find the bodies.

36:51.740 --> 36:53.040
That's what
I can do.

36:53.040 --> 36:54.840
How'd you even know
I had a sister?

36:54.840 --> 36:55.840
You're my property, kid.

36:55.840 --> 36:57.340
I know everything about you.

36:57.340 --> 36:59.480
So this is how
it goes.

36:59.480 --> 37:02.110
You fight one more fight
for me tonight.

37:02.120 --> 37:04.280
After that,
you're free and clear.

37:04.280 --> 37:07.950
And you get
your baby sister back.

37:07.960 --> 37:09.620
Whatever you say,
just don't hurt her.

37:10.860 --> 37:11.890
I'll see you tonight.

Haven't seen
much of you.

to help?

and I leave,

37:44.730 --> 37:46.320
I want you to stand
by the door.

37:46.330 --> 37:47.990
When you hear
a horn honk twice,

37:48.000 --> 37:49.590
nod at C.D.

37:50.600 --> 37:51.630
What do I do?

37:51.630 --> 37:54.170
When Uncle Ray nods to ya,

37:54.170 --> 37:55.430
I want you to call the police

37:55.440 --> 37:56.970
and have them send
a squad car down here.

37:56.970 --> 37:58.640
What's this
all about, nephew?

37:58.640 --> 38:01.340
Just tying up
a few loose ends.

38:01.340 --> 38:03.040
I'll help
where I can.

38:05.580 --> 38:07.410
Walker, I couldn't
reach Diane.

38:07.410 --> 38:08.450
I tried her motel.

38:08.450 --> 38:10.150
Why don't you
try her brother.

38:16.020 --> 38:17.020
Hello?

38:17.020 --> 38:18.290
<i> Randy, it's Jimmy.</i>

38:18.290 --> 38:20.390
Listen, I can't
talk right now, man.

38:20.390 --> 38:21.590
<i> I'm real busy, okay?</i>

38:21.600 --> 38:22.990
We're going to
Cantrell's tonight.

38:23.000 --> 38:24.100
<i> We're gonna stop the fight.</i>

38:24.100 --> 38:25.100
<i> We're gonna arrest him.</i>

38:25.100 --> 38:26.730
You can't do that, man!

38:28.230 --> 38:29.870
They got my sister.

38:29.870 --> 38:31.040
You hear what I'm sayin', man?

38:31.040 --> 38:32.270
You hear what I'm tellin' you?

38:32.270 --> 38:33.700
<i> I hear what</i>
<i> you're sayin'.</i>

38:33.710 --> 38:34.770
<i> Randy, you got to let us--</i>

38:38.150 --> 38:39.610
Cantrell's got Diane.

38:41.050 --> 38:42.310
Twice on the horn?

38:42.320 --> 38:43.820
Yeah, then make your call.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.420
Two guys in a maroon car
across the street.

38:53.430 --> 38:54.490
Yeah, I noticed.

38:54.490 --> 38:55.730
It's the two guys
I tangled with

38:55.730 --> 38:56.730
at the Bare Knuckles.

38:56.730 --> 38:57.800
You saw 'em?

38:57.800 --> 38:59.130
Yeah, they've been
following us

38:59.130 --> 39:01.400
ever since they dropped
us off last night.

39:01.400 --> 39:03.700
What do you
wanna do?

39:03.700 --> 39:05.240
Fun's over.

39:06.140 --> 39:07.140
You got it.

39:16.850 --> 39:18.580
( tires screeching )

39:23.560 --> 39:25.760
Present, boys.
Texas Ranger.

39:27.590 --> 39:29.630
Cuff yourselves.

39:29.630 --> 39:31.630
( cuffs clicking )

39:34.970 --> 39:37.300
( horn honks twice )

39:48.650 --> 39:50.720
We've got a big problem.

39:50.720 --> 39:52.680
Cal and Henry.
I don't know where they are.

39:58.590 --> 39:59.690
I'll take care of it.

40:02.530 --> 40:04.290
Okay, guys, here's the deal.

40:04.300 --> 40:05.860
Randy's retiring
after this fight.

40:05.870 --> 40:08.030
We're gonna give him
a royal send-off.

40:08.030 --> 40:10.400
Doubleheader.
No holds barred.

40:10.400 --> 40:12.300
This crowd wants
to see some blood,

40:12.310 --> 40:14.040
and we're gonna
give it to 'em.

40:17.780 --> 40:18.980
How are we
gonna find her?

40:18.980 --> 40:20.710
She's gotta be
around here somewhere.

40:28.250 --> 40:29.290
( whispers ):
Hey, wait.

40:29.290 --> 40:31.190
Think, Trivette, think!

40:31.190 --> 40:32.190
We're unarmed.

40:32.190 --> 40:33.360
While you're
fighting Randy,

40:33.360 --> 40:34.490
I'll go get her.

40:34.490 --> 40:36.230
I can't fight Randy.
He's my friend.

40:36.230 --> 40:38.160
Listen, listen!

40:38.160 --> 40:40.660
Just tell him to back off
and take it easy.

40:40.670 --> 40:41.800
While you guys
are fighting,

40:41.800 --> 40:42.970
I'll get her
out of there.

40:44.240 --> 40:46.740
( cheering and applause )

40:50.810 --> 40:53.010
Tonight, our champion,

40:53.010 --> 40:55.550
Randy Warren,
in his final appearance--

40:55.550 --> 40:57.050
( crowd boos )

41:00.050 --> 41:02.050
( cheering )

41:05.760 --> 41:09.060
He will take on
two consecutive opponents!

41:11.000 --> 41:13.100
Ladies and gentlemen,

41:13.100 --> 41:15.630
our first challenger.

41:15.640 --> 41:18.940
Standing 6 feet tall,

41:18.940 --> 41:23.240
weighing 173 pounds,

41:23.240 --> 41:25.280
the white X!

41:25.280 --> 41:27.550
( crowd cheers half-heartedly )

41:27.550 --> 41:29.950
You kill him,
or your sister dies.

41:59.610 --> 42:01.080
Randy, take it easy.

42:01.080 --> 42:02.250
Just lay down.

42:02.250 --> 42:03.850
What are you
trying to do?

42:06.220 --> 42:08.720
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

42:19.830 --> 42:21.600
( knocking )

42:21.600 --> 42:23.270
Who is it?

42:23.270 --> 42:24.270
Cantrell.

42:30.580 --> 42:31.580
I lied.

42:33.210 --> 42:34.950
Come on, Diane.
Let's get outta here.

42:46.260 --> 42:47.260
Trivette!

42:50.630 --> 42:51.630
Go. Go. Go.

42:59.470 --> 43:00.470
Ow!

43:01.470 --> 43:02.810
Hurts, huh?

43:10.020 --> 43:11.020
( gags )

43:35.440 --> 43:36.440
Ugh.

43:38.310 --> 43:39.310
Jeez!

43:45.020 --> 43:46.250
Randy!

43:46.250 --> 43:47.250
Randy!

43:56.260 --> 43:57.260
Hey!

44:03.500 --> 44:04.500
You okay?
Yeah.

44:04.500 --> 44:05.940
You sure?

44:05.940 --> 44:07.870
Randy.

44:07.870 --> 44:08.870
RANDY:
You all right?

44:08.870 --> 44:09.870
DIANE:
Are you okay?

44:11.980 --> 44:13.850
You do that?

44:13.850 --> 44:15.110
Did you do that?

44:16.580 --> 44:17.850
Yeah, well...

44:17.850 --> 44:20.220
You're one
tough cookie, pard.

44:20.220 --> 44:22.050
Well, then why
do I feel so bruised?

44:32.230 --> 44:33.230
DIANE:
Hi, Jimmy.

44:36.070 --> 44:37.370
Hi.

44:37.370 --> 44:39.800
I just came
to say goodbye.

44:42.170 --> 44:43.470
What time does
your plane leave?

44:43.480 --> 44:45.440
In a couple of minutes.
I gotta go.

44:46.380 --> 44:48.480
I just saw Randy.

44:48.480 --> 44:50.180
They're gonna
recommend probation.

44:51.120 --> 44:52.750
I have you
and Ranger Walker

44:52.750 --> 44:53.750
to thank for that.

44:56.390 --> 44:57.760
You ever get to Chicago?

44:57.760 --> 45:00.490
Does hanging out
in O'Hare Airport count?

45:00.960 --> 45:01.960
No.

45:01.960 --> 45:02.960
No.

45:06.130 --> 45:08.530
Well, you ever decide to visit,

45:08.530 --> 45:10.840
give a call, okay?

45:10.840 --> 45:12.570
Okay.

45:12.570 --> 45:13.570
Okay.

45:30.060 --> 45:31.060
You okay?

45:32.730 --> 45:34.890
Yeah, I'm okay.

45:34.890 --> 45:36.930
What's that in your
back pocket there, partner?

45:36.930 --> 45:39.230
Airline ticket
to Chicago?

45:39.230 --> 45:40.430
Maybe.

45:41.270 --> 45:42.530
What are you
doing tonight?

45:42.540 --> 45:44.000
I don't know.
Maybe I'll go to a movie.

45:44.000 --> 45:45.070
WALKER:
Hey, hey.

45:45.070 --> 45:46.300
Guess what's showing?

45:46.310 --> 45:47.310
The revival

45:47.310 --> 45:48.310
of <i> Spartacus.</i>

45:48.310 --> 45:49.840
Naw, naw, I'll pass.

45:49.840 --> 45:52.810
You're gonna pass
on <i> Spartacus?</i>

45:52.810 --> 45:54.450
Come on!
It's my favorite movie!

45:54.450 --> 45:56.010
Oh, mine too.

45:56.020 --> 45:57.920
Remember that scene
where those men were willing

45:57.920 --> 46:02.120
to sacrifice their lives
for Spartacus?

46:02.120 --> 46:03.890
Courage.

46:03.890 --> 46:05.890
Nobility.

46:05.890 --> 46:07.190
I'm Spartacus.

46:07.190 --> 46:08.830
I'm Spartacus.

46:08.830 --> 46:10.360
I'm Spartacus.

46:11.860 --> 46:15.370
(<i> harmonica theme playing</i> )

46:15.370 --> 46:16.970
I'm Spartacus!
