- No. No.

00:17.270 --> 00:19.004

00:19.039 --> 00:20.406
<i>She told him she didn't believe
he killed his girlfriend.</i>

00:20.440 --> 00:22.174

00:22.209 --> 00:23.642
<i>She was sure he was set up</i>

00:23.677 --> 00:27.079
<i>and they needed to bring
the real killer to justice.</i>

00:27.114 --> 00:30.116

- But then he slipped.

- No!

There's nothing you could do, huh?

00:50.670 --> 00:52.138
Still no sign of them?

00:52.172 --> 00:53.372
Another coast guard
boat joined the search.

00:53.406 --> 00:56.208
- You heard from the harbor patrol?
- They got divers in the water.

00:56.243 --> 00:58.310
But she won't survive very
long in this cold water.

00:58.345 --> 00:59.712
I got to get on one of those boats.

00:59.746 --> 01:01.247
No, there's nothing
you can do on the water.

01:01.281 --> 01:03.282
We need to continue
coordinating the search,

01:03.316 --> 01:05.351
relaying information from here.

01:05.385 --> 01:07.119
Maura, did you see which
way they were swimming?

01:07.154 --> 01:09.221
No. The current just swept them
away from the bridge so fast,

01:09.256 --> 01:11.056
they just disappeared in the darkness.

01:11.091 --> 01:14.004
You know the currents around
here. What are their chances?

01:14.528 --> 01:17.363
Come on, Korsak. I really need
to know where we stand here.

01:17.397 --> 01:18.731
People have gone in
the water around here

01:18.765 --> 01:21.467
and been swept right out to sea.
But they weren't Jane Rizzoli.

01:21.501 --> 01:24.603
- I can't believe I let her jump.
- You didn't let her.

01:25.138 --> 01:26.672
Their best chance is if they were able

01:26.706 --> 01:28.340
to swim to one of these
outlying islands here.

- What is it?

01:36.933 --> 01:38.967
The press. They know we're
searching for Jane and Paul,

01:39.002 --> 01:40.836
want to know what's going on.

01:40.870 --> 01:42.471
Prosecutor jumps off a bridge
after killing his girlfriend?

01:42.505 --> 01:43.605
That's a front-page story.

01:43.640 --> 01:46.675
Someone needs to notify Paul's
wife before the press gets to her.

01:46.710 --> 01:48.777
Well, we'll stay here
until they find her.

01:48.812 --> 01:53.248

I don't know if it's any comfort,

killed Danni Mitchell.

03:36.502 --> 03:39.204

03:59.142 --> 04:01.743
He said fishermen caught
several red drum last week,

04:01.778 --> 04:05.046
which is indicative of warmer
currents moving up the coast.

04:05.081 --> 04:06.882
So, the surface

- Yeah, it's possible.

Which means she could
survive longer in the water.

- It's my favorite.
- [Sighs] Okay.

08:19.971 --> 08:23.007
I know jumping in after
Paul was dangerous.

08:23.041 --> 08:27.478
Did you think about
any of us before you jumped?

08:27.512 --> 08:32.616
No, I didn't.

08:32.650 --> 08:37.354
I didn't think about you.
And I didn't think about my family.

08:37.389 --> 08:39.957
I didn't even think about myself.

08:39.991 --> 08:43.159
The only person
that I thought about was Paul

08:43.195 --> 08:46.430
and that I was the only
one that could help him.

08:46.465 --> 08:49.133
I wasn't gonna let him drown, Maura.

08:49.167 --> 08:53.104
I guess that's the instinct
that makes you such a good cop.

08:55.140 --> 08:57.774
And maybe a bit hard to love.

09:01.646 --> 09:04.148
I was just afraid I lost you.

09:06.618 --> 09:10.688
[Sighs] And I just kept thinking that
I didn't do enough to help you. I ...

09:10.722 --> 09:13.557
Why didn't I go and
help you talk Paul down,

09:13.592 --> 09:16.594
or why didn't I stop you
from going over the railing?

09:16.628 --> 09:21.065
Why wasn't I closer to grab you?

09:21.099 --> 09:22.333
[Sighs]

09:22.767 --> 09:25.069
That's survivor's guilt.

09:26.538 --> 09:30.574
- Excuse me?
- BPD did a seminar on it.

09:30.609 --> 09:34.578
- You went?
- I read the pamphlet.

09:36.615 --> 09:41.218
Survivor's guilt.
That makes perfect sense.

09:41.253 --> 09:45.489
- Why didn't I think of that?
- Well, there's a first time for everything.

09:48.193 --> 09:49.760
Maura, there was nothing
you could have done

09:49.795 --> 09:53.397
on that bridge, okay?
That's on me.

09:55.967 --> 10:00.671
- Weren't you scared?
- Not until I was falling.

10:00.705 --> 10:04.275
Then, yeah, then I was petrified.

10:05.777 --> 10:08.445
And my life flashed
before my eyes and ...

10:08.480 --> 10:11.348
the weirdest thing was
all I could think about

10:11.383 --> 10:15.419
- was all the stuff I still want to do.
- Like what?

10:15.453 --> 10:19.056
I don't know. Um, watch the
Sox win another series or...

10:19.090 --> 10:22.626
go to beer-brewing class
or learn how to make ravioli.

10:22.661 --> 10:24.295
[Chuckles] Really?

10:24.329 --> 10:26.597
You're plunging to your death

10:26.631 --> 10:29.767
and you had ravioli
and beer on your mind?

10:29.801 --> 10:32.303
I'm a girl with simple tastes.

10:32.337 --> 10:34.672
I think we need to work
on your bucket list.

10:34.706 --> 10:38.075
That sounds like crazy fun!

10:38.109 --> 10:43.848
But right now we have a case to crack.
So... what's our next step?

10:43.882 --> 10:47.451
Susie, we have a new case ...
Danni Mitchell.

10:47.485 --> 10:50.821
She is a 25-year-old woman
who was found dead in her apartment.

10:50.856 --> 10:53.357
All right. Either I'm being
punk'd or you're losing it.

10:53.391 --> 10:55.910
Well, I never punk,
and I can assure you I'm in

10:55.911 --> 10:57.627
- full control of my faculties.
- And I can assure you

10:57.662 --> 10:59.763
that Danni Mitchell is a
case we started last week.

10:59.798 --> 11:02.233
Well, we're gonna start
the case again this week.

11:02.267 --> 11:05.502
So, why are we entering
this parallel universe?

11:05.537 --> 11:08.839
Paul Westcourt was set up,
and we took the bait.

11:08.874 --> 11:13.130
We believed what the real
killer wanted us to believe.

11:15.981 --> 11:18.649
So we're looking at it with
fresh eyes and an open mind.

11:18.683 --> 11:20.584
I couldn't have said it better myself.

11:20.619 --> 11:24.028
Now let's figure out what we missed.

11:24.522 --> 11:27.224
Still can't believe
you jumped in after me.

11:27.259 --> 11:31.195
- Well, I was just doing my job.
- We both know that's not true.

11:31.229 --> 11:34.498
Well, trying to figure out
who might want you in jail ...

11:34.532 --> 11:36.233
that's my job now. So...

11:36.268 --> 11:38.769
Who hated you enough
to do something like this?

11:38.803 --> 11:42.273
[Chuckles] Long list.
I burned a lot of bridges

11:42.307 --> 11:44.742
climbing the ladder
in the D.A.'s office.

11:44.776 --> 11:49.680
- Thanks.
- No, this ... this was personal.

11:49.714 --> 11:55.386
What about a-a friend...
or maybe another girlfriend?

11:55.420 --> 12:00.925
- There was never any other girlfriend.
- Okay.

12:00.959 --> 12:03.260
Well, somebody went
after the woman you love,

12:03.295 --> 12:06.597
- so somebody knew there was an affair.
- Impossible.

12:06.631 --> 12:08.198
We were so careful to keep it secret.

12:08.233 --> 12:13.337
[Scoffs] The entire time?
You never slipped up once?

12:13.371 --> 12:17.574
You never thought maybe
somebody you knew saw you?

12:17.609 --> 12:22.713
Only thing I can think of is one night,
I felt like a car was following us.

12:22.747 --> 12:25.416
It pulled into the motel behind us
and was still there when we came out.

12:25.450 --> 12:29.720
- Danni thought I was being paranoid.
- Did you get a plate number?

12:29.754 --> 12:31.322
- Nope.
- Make, model?

12:31.356 --> 12:35.592
It was a little red, maybe
burgundy, economy car.

12:35.627 --> 12:37.594
It was dark. I ... I know.

12:37.629 --> 12:39.997
- It's not much to go on.
- No, it isn't.

12:41.733 --> 12:46.737
- We're in trouble here, aren't we?
- We'll find something.

12:46.771 --> 12:48.773
[Sighs]

12:49.177 --> 12:52.112
Okay. I reconfirmed Paul's
wife's alibi. It's solid.

12:52.147 --> 12:53.414
Phone records

12:53.448 --> 12:54.682
have her on her cell at
the time of the murder.

12:54.716 --> 12:56.283
Cell tower pings put her at home.

12:56.318 --> 12:59.320
Well, you're on the road to solid.
You're not quite there yet.

12:59.354 --> 13:01.355
She was online playing her
regular nightly chess game

13:01.389 --> 13:02.623
with a guy in London.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.658
I.P. address goes back
to her laptop at home.

13:04.693 --> 13:06.327
And welcome to solid.

13:06.361 --> 13:08.596
Did you find anybody else
who'd want to take Paul down?

13:08.630 --> 13:09.797
[Sighs]

13:09.831 --> 13:12.049
Mm, I've looked at the families
of a dozen murderers

13:12.050 --> 13:14.635
that he put behind bars.
There's nothing that leads me to believe

13:14.669 --> 13:17.238
any of them would have
concocted such an elaborate plan

13:17.272 --> 13:20.674
- to get back at him.
- Then your revenge theory is wrong. Jane.

13:22.277 --> 13:24.436
You sure about this guy?

13:31.271 --> 13:35.040
- How's it going?
- Hey.

13:35.075 --> 13:38.043
This case is going down
faster than the Titanic.

13:38.078 --> 13:42.047
I have been looking at everyone
inside and outside the D.A.'s office,

13:42.082 --> 13:44.083
trying to see if anyone
had a personal ax

13:44.117 --> 13:45.351
- to grind with Paul.
- Nothing?

13:45.385 --> 13:48.787
- Nothing out of the ordinary, no.
- Hmm.

13:48.822 --> 13:51.023
Frankie, can you finish
going through these files?

13:51.057 --> 13:52.491
Maybe you'll have better luck

13:52.525 --> 13:54.793
trying to find someone
who wanted to frame Paul.

13:54.828 --> 13:56.562
Well, I got to meet Ma for lunch first.

13:56.596 --> 13:58.931
Did she say anything to
you about a job interview?

13:58.965 --> 14:01.200
Just that she had one.
She didn't want to jinx it.

14:01.234 --> 14:05.037
- Why does she want to talk to me?
- Just lucky, I guess.

14:11.744 --> 14:14.947
Okay, so, I've been
scouring the ads for work.

14:14.981 --> 14:19.485
- I'm sure it's tough out there.
- Nope. I found the perfect job.

14:19.519 --> 14:21.920
But I really need you to help me.

14:21.955 --> 14:24.523
I'm not gonna threaten to give
someone a parking ticket again.

14:24.557 --> 14:28.360
No, I only want you to help
me practice for my interview.

14:28.395 --> 14:33.432
[Chuckles] Okay.
So, what's the job?

14:33.466 --> 14:35.834
It's a management training position

14:35.869 --> 14:38.504
with a really, really
large restaurant company.

14:38.538 --> 14:41.407
And it comes with a great salary,

14:41.441 --> 14:45.544
health benefits, and a pension plan.

14:45.578 --> 14:49.114
Well, I never had a pension
plan before, Frankie.

14:49.149 --> 14:50.416
[Chuckles]

14:50.450 --> 14:53.052
Ma, uh, how are you
gonna get them to see

14:53.086 --> 14:57.089
that your experience as a
housewife a-and a deli worker

14:57.123 --> 14:58.524
makes you right for
a high-end restaurant job?

14:58.558 --> 14:59.958
Well, that's what I'm gonna show you

14:59.993 --> 15:02.961
- when we practice for my interview.
- Okay.

15:05.632 --> 15:10.035
- Wonder what that's all about.
- I don't know.

15:10.070 --> 15:11.870
All I know is that he's
invited us down here

15:11.905 --> 15:13.939
for some kind of celebration tonight.

15:13.973 --> 15:18.010
- Hmm.
- So, come on. Let's go.

15:18.044 --> 15:20.979
All right. [Clears throat]

15:23.383 --> 15:25.284
[Chuckles]
There's like 50 questions here.

15:25.318 --> 15:29.088
75. [Chuckles]
I really need to be prepared, Frankie.

15:29.122 --> 15:30.489
Okay. [Sighs]

15:30.523 --> 15:32.491
Uh... [clears throat]

15:32.525 --> 15:36.028
How does a woman with
so much work experience

15:36.062 --> 15:38.464
have such a youthful appearance?

15:38.498 --> 15:40.399
[Both laugh]

15:40.433 --> 15:43.969
Really?
No one's gonna ask you that.

15:44.003 --> 15:45.904
I know. It's just a joke question.

15:45.939 --> 15:48.207
- Go ahead. Go to the next one.
- All right.

15:48.441 --> 15:52.201
Oh. I was thinking, we should
make our own bucket lists

15:52.236 --> 15:53.245
and share them with each other.

15:53.279 --> 15:56.315
Couldn't I just take you
out for gluten-free pizza?

15:56.349 --> 15:57.616
Well, I think you owe me this.

15:57.650 --> 15:59.318
I mean, I spent the
entire night on the bridge

15:59.352 --> 16:01.920
sure I was never going to see you again.

16:02.075 --> 16:04.576
[Groaning]
Okay, I'll make a bucket list.

16:04.611 --> 16:07.646
- Yes!
- Is this why you called me down here?

16:07.680 --> 16:09.348
No. I called you because you were right.

16:09.382 --> 16:11.717
[Normal voice] Of course I was.
About what?

16:11.751 --> 16:15.153
Fresh eyes on Danni's murder.
So I went back to Paul's fingerprint,

16:15.188 --> 16:17.589
and I did a microanalysis on
everything that was left behind.

16:17.624 --> 16:19.157
I found soybean oil,

16:19.192 --> 16:22.661
vinegar, tomato purã©e,
and sodium benzoate.

16:22.695 --> 16:25.297
- Which means?
- Paul likes barbecue sauce.

16:25.331 --> 16:30.168
Okay.
Great news if we're planning a cookout.

16:30.203 --> 16:33.238
It's not exactly the case-breaking
clue I was hoping for.

16:33.273 --> 16:35.107
It's just the beginning.

16:35.141 --> 16:38.310
- She got a haircut.
- Well, that's what I thought.

16:38.344 --> 16:41.780
But I was looking at the case
file from the first murder,

16:41.814 --> 16:46.318
and the victim in that case
also had long hair in her DMV photo

16:46.352 --> 16:50.455
- and short hair in her autopsy photo.
- She got a haircut, too?

16:50.490 --> 16:53.225
Well, the coincidence made
me look back at Danni's photo,

16:53.259 --> 16:57.162
and I realized that
her hair was cut after she died.

16:57.196 --> 17:00.599
So, to the trained eye,
it's obvious that both victims' hair

17:00.633 --> 17:02.267
was not cut by a professional ...

17:02.302 --> 17:04.536
that somebody just grabbed it
and lopped it off.

17:04.569 --> 17:07.772
So, both victims had their
hair cut after they were dead.

17:07.807 --> 17:10.709
And since nobody investigating
the original case noticed it,

17:10.742 --> 17:13.878
either Danni's killer
murdered both women

17:13.913 --> 17:16.181
and Paul convicted
the wrong man or ...

17:16.214 --> 17:19.651
Danni's killer learned
that detail from the first killer.

17:19.685 --> 17:21.353
Mm! Way to go, Maura.

17:25.558 --> 17:28.827
<i>So, you think the guy sitting in
prison knows who murdered Danni?</i>

17:28.861 --> 17:31.480
Yeah. I do.
I think we should get to him

17:31.481 --> 17:32.264
first thing tomorrow morning.

17:32.298 --> 17:33.799
Well, maybe we don't
need to be so hasty.

17:33.833 --> 17:36.735
- Why shouldn't we?
- I've been over this guy's case files,

17:36.769 --> 17:38.770
and one thing's very clear ...
he hates women.

17:38.805 --> 17:40.672
Last time I looked, you're a woman.

17:41.107 --> 17:44.176
It's easy to see how you made detective.

17:44.210 --> 17:46.382
[Chuckles] I'm just saying,
I don't think we're doing

17:46.383 --> 17:48.714
ourselves any favors to put
you in a room with that maniac.

17:48.748 --> 17:51.316
- I can handle him.
- Yeah, I can, too.

17:51.351 --> 17:52.851
I just think it's better
if I take a run at him.

17:52.885 --> 17:55.348
All right, yeah, you
don't need to convince me

17:55.383 --> 17:57.430
- to stay in bed one more hour.
- No problem.

17:57.465 --> 17:59.424
Frankie: What's the big mystery?
Why'd you call us all down here?

17:59.459 --> 18:03.161
- Soon enough.
- Yeah, what's going on, Vince?

18:03.196 --> 18:06.798
- So, beers around?
- I'll have a shiraz.

18:08.368 --> 18:10.235
How come you playing bartender?

18:10.269 --> 18:15.340
I'm not really playing bartender.
I'm just filling in for tonight.

18:15.375 --> 18:18.210
Okay. I'm with Frankie.
What's going on?

18:18.244 --> 18:20.412
After lots of discussions
with Kiki about my future,

18:20.446 --> 18:23.515
I've decided this is my retirement
plan. It will give me a way

18:23.516 --> 18:26.585
to make money and a place to
play music in my twilight years.

18:26.819 --> 18:28.320
I bought the place.

18:28.654 --> 18:31.323
You're looking at the new
owner of the Dirty Robber.

18:31.357 --> 18:36.261
So, you keep working
and we get free drinks.

18:36.295 --> 18:37.262
[Chuckles]

18:37.296 --> 18:38.830
How about I keep working

18:38.865 --> 18:42.200
and I put you all on my friends
and family discount plan?

18:42.235 --> 18:44.469
Fair enough.

18:44.504 --> 18:48.801
Well, cheers.
To renaissance man, a cop,

18:48.836 --> 18:51.676
musician, and...
businessman extraordinaire.

18:51.711 --> 18:53.211
- How exciting!
- Hear, hear.

18:53.246 --> 18:54.212
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

18:54.247 --> 18:56.014
<i>- Bona fortuna.
- Mm.</i>

18:58.431 --> 19:00.899
[Buzzer]

19:09.609 --> 19:11.009
[Buzzer]

19:15.715 --> 19:19.084
Mark, I'm Detective Korsak.

19:19.118 --> 19:23.421
- What do you want?
- To talk.

19:23.456 --> 19:25.090
How's life in walpole treating you?

19:25.124 --> 19:28.193
- Things couldn't be better.
- Really?

19:28.227 --> 19:31.096
I heard you had a big
complaint about prison life.

19:31.130 --> 19:33.832
The room service isn't
as good as I expected.

19:33.866 --> 19:36.101
Oh, and I hear the library
is too small for your taste.

19:36.135 --> 19:38.003
You've already been
through all the books.

19:38.037 --> 19:41.740
What can I say?
I'm a voracious reader.

19:41.774 --> 19:43.942
That why I brought you a bagful.

19:47.013 --> 19:50.849
- What do I have to do?
- Answer a few questions.

19:53.953 --> 19:56.488
What do you want to know?

19:56.522 --> 19:58.990
We found out you chopped
your victim's hair off

19:59.025 --> 20:02.927
- for a trophy.
- Why go back and look at my case?

20:02.962 --> 20:05.463
I'm investigating a murder that
was carried out the same way.

20:05.498 --> 20:09.134
Did you have an accomplice
that knew you cut your victim's hair?

20:09.168 --> 20:13.171
The librarian told me
that you like war history.

20:13.205 --> 20:16.675
This book won the
booker prize last year.

20:16.709 --> 20:18.877
There was no accomplice.

20:18.911 --> 20:20.478
Well, somebody knew what
you did with the hair

20:20.513 --> 20:23.048
because they copied
every detail of your crime.

20:27.787 --> 20:29.921
I had a pen pal.

20:30.355 --> 20:33.491
I'm gonna need a little
bit more than that.

20:33.526 --> 20:35.193
This chick ... she sent
me a bunch of letters.

20:35.227 --> 20:38.163
She said she liked me, and
eventually, I let her come and visit.

20:38.197 --> 20:41.800
She said she couldn't
stand seeing me locked up.

20:41.834 --> 20:44.035
She hated the prosecutor
and she wanted to avenge

20:44.070 --> 20:47.906
what he did to me, so...
I gave her a tutorial.

20:47.940 --> 20:52.844
- What's her name?
- Sarah Daniels.

20:52.878 --> 20:57.882
- Thank you.
- Hey! We had a deal.

20:57.917 --> 20:59.951
Info for books.

21:01.587 --> 21:03.855
You'll like this one.

21:03.889 --> 21:08.293
"The Feminine Mystique"
by Betty Friedan.

21:20.838 --> 21:23.415
- Hey, Dr. Isles.
- Nina, hello.

21:23.450 --> 21:25.684
Jane asked me to pick up
Mark Talbot's prison letters

21:25.719 --> 21:27.586
if you're done analyzing them.

21:27.621 --> 21:30.022
[Sighs] We are finished
with the letters.

21:30.056 --> 21:31.991
We didn't find anything helpful.

21:32.025 --> 21:34.860
But Susie is still
working on the envelopes.

21:34.895 --> 21:36.262
I'll let her know.

21:36.296 --> 21:39.331
- So, how's BPD treating you?
- I love it.

21:39.366 --> 21:40.599
Kind of feel like I've
finally found a home.

21:40.634 --> 21:42.968
- And you're from Chicago, right?
- Born and raised.

21:43.003 --> 21:47.406
- So how'd you end you here?
- Um, it's a long story.

21:47.440 --> 21:51.277
Are you okay?
I-I didn't mean to upset you.

21:51.311 --> 21:53.698
It's not you.

21:55.139 --> 21:58.817
It's the 14-year-old kid who killed
my boyfriend to get in a gang.

22:00.066 --> 22:05.272
I'm sorry.
Is that why you left Chicago PD?

22:05.958 --> 22:08.827
My beat was overrun with gangs.

22:08.862 --> 22:10.329
I made sure the middle-school kids

22:10.363 --> 22:12.298
on their way home were
safe, and they were.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.567
I had their backs.

22:14.601 --> 22:16.835
Marcus was a teacher
at that middle school.

22:16.870 --> 22:21.840
The boy who shot him was a student,
killed him in his classroom.

22:21.875 --> 22:25.978
I couldn't protect
the person I loved most.

22:26.012 --> 22:28.380
I'm really sorry that I brought it up.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.849
Oh, I'm glad you asked.

22:31.084 --> 22:35.754
It was kind of strange not having
anyone around here who knew.

22:52.706 --> 22:54.373
[Telephone ringing]

23:01.548 --> 23:03.882
<i>Excuse me.</i>

23:03.917 --> 23:08.621
[Sighs]

23:08.655 --> 23:16.028
- It's so nice you're here. [Chuckles]
- Thank you, I guess.

23:16.062 --> 23:18.264
I just mean I am really nervous
and I wish my mom had come

23:18.265 --> 23:21.546
to the interview with me
like you have.

23:22.969 --> 23:25.037
Which one is your daughter?

23:26.071 --> 23:32.044
Angela Rizzoli?
You're next up.

23:32.578 --> 23:37.383
Korsak: Ah, the warden sent you
all of Mark's jailhouse correspondence.

23:37.417 --> 23:40.419
Yeah.
Crime lab just finished all the letters.

23:40.453 --> 23:45.124
I reviewed all the prison
security video, pulled some stills.

23:45.158 --> 23:46.825
She always wore a hat and glasses.

23:46.860 --> 23:49.161
She knew exactly where the
cameras were and how to avoid them.

23:49.195 --> 23:52.506
- Hmm.
- Sarah Daniels' last address was

23:52.507 --> 23:55.567
- in South Boston on Dorchester.
- Well, we need to pick her up.

23:55.602 --> 23:57.703
Uniforms are already bringing her in.

24:00.040 --> 24:02.808
- Hi. Barry Martin.
- Hi. Angela Rizzoli.

24:02.842 --> 24:04.677
Hi. Very nice to meet you.

24:04.711 --> 24:07.680
I know what you're thinking.
I'm too old.

24:07.714 --> 24:10.616
- Oh.
- But, Mr. Martin, I've got something

24:10.650 --> 24:14.720
none of those lovely young
girls in your waiting room have,

24:14.754 --> 24:16.789
and that's real-life experience.

24:16.823 --> 24:19.591
Everyone brings something
unique to the party.

24:19.626 --> 24:21.126
Well, I m glad you said that.

24:21.161 --> 24:24.463
What makes me unique
is all the things that I bring.

24:24.497 --> 24:28.867
I've raised three children
who turned out amazingly well.

24:28.902 --> 24:32.805
Well, actually,
one has had his struggles.

24:32.839 --> 24:36.675
I managed my husband's plumbing
company for over 20 years.

24:36.710 --> 24:38.477
And a couple of years ago,

24:38.511 --> 24:40.979
I went back to work in
the restaurant business.

24:41.014 --> 24:43.849
I see you worked at the,
uh, Division 1 Café.

24:43.883 --> 24:46.018
Well, I didn't just work there.

24:46.052 --> 24:51.590
I was the café's cook,
waitress, manager, dishwasher,

24:51.624 --> 24:55.094
and occasional bouncer.
[Chuckles]

24:55.128 --> 24:59.465
- That actually all sounds good.
- I'm a hard worker, Mr. Martin.

24:59.499 --> 25:01.500
And I'm really good with people.

25:01.534 --> 25:04.536
And I ... well, I would
like to work with you.

25:04.571 --> 25:08.707
And if you give me this opportunity,
I won't let you down.

25:08.742 --> 25:12.828
Look, I-I can see
there are a lot of really

25:12.829 --> 25:16.048
good candidates for this job.
But in my book,

25:16.082 --> 25:19.651
age and experience trumps
youth every single time.

25:19.686 --> 25:22.087
Your age is not even a consideration.

25:22.122 --> 25:25.090
- Really?
- Really.

25:25.125 --> 25:27.526
[Sighs]

25:28.560 --> 25:31.530
Officers said they put
Sarah Daniels in here.

25:37.203 --> 25:39.671
What is it that you think I've done?

25:43.877 --> 25:47.045
<i>I've been in
a wheelchair since I was 16.</i>

25:47.080 --> 25:51.517
<i>I was paralyzed from the waist down
in a high-school gymnastics accident.</i>

25:51.551 --> 25:54.286
Your driver's license was used
in a prison visiting office.

25:55.320 --> 26:01.226
- Uh, w-was it about three months ago?
- Yeah. How'd you know?

26:02.729 --> 26:04.530
That was about
the time I lost my wallet.

26:04.564 --> 26:07.199
You remember where you
were when you lost it?

26:07.233 --> 26:09.968
Uh, I'd only been
to two places that day ...

26:10.003 --> 26:11.737
uh, a post office on Wilton

26:11.771 --> 26:13.806
and my physical therapist's
office at 120 Broadstreet.

26:13.840 --> 26:17.176
- I went back, but I couldn't find it.
- What else was in the wallet?

26:17.210 --> 26:20.779
A few credit cards, dry-cleaning
receipt, and a little cash.

26:20.814 --> 26:21.980
Did they ever try to
use the credit cards?

26:22.015 --> 26:23.782
No.

26:23.817 --> 26:29.721
Um... do you by chance recognize
the woman that stole your I.D.?

26:29.756 --> 26:35.008
Uh, based on this photo, I...
it could be anyone.

26:36.329 --> 26:37.863
[Door opens]

26:37.897 --> 26:39.898
I can't find any connection
between Sarah Daniels

26:39.933 --> 26:43.352
- and anyone involved in this case.
- Well, maybe she was

26:43.353 --> 26:46.638
targeted by the murderer
because they both look alike.

26:46.673 --> 26:49.308
I hope so
because if this is random,

26:49.342 --> 26:53.078
it could be like looking
for a needle in a haystack.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.314
What are you gonna tell Paul?

26:55.348 --> 26:59.051
That we're knee-deep
in a very big haystack.

26:59.085 --> 27:00.319
[Sighs]

27:01.387 --> 27:03.255
[Sighs]

27:04.289 --> 27:06.124
What's going on?

27:06.159 --> 27:07.860
[Sighs]

27:08.094 --> 27:12.731
We thought we had the murderer
and I wanted to see if you knew her,

27:12.765 --> 27:16.668
- but it turns out she didn't do it.
- Tell me there's at least

27:16.703 --> 27:18.914
a glimmer of light
at the end of this tunnel.

27:18.949 --> 27:22.207
Okay. We know that
Danni's killer is a woman.

27:22.242 --> 27:26.612
We know that she got into
the prison with an I.D.

27:26.613 --> 27:30.983
that she stole somewhere
around 120 Broadstreet.

27:31.017 --> 27:34.753
We know...
Does that area mean something to you?

27:34.787 --> 27:37.756
No. I-I mean, it's around
the corner from my office,

27:37.790 --> 27:40.926
so I was just thinking I must
pass by there almost every day.

27:40.960 --> 27:43.896
Is there anything else you found?
What about the red car?

27:43.930 --> 27:47.232
- Any luck?
- We checked with the hotel.

27:47.267 --> 27:50.302
We looked at security
cameras in the area.

27:50.336 --> 27:53.639
Nothing turned up.
[Sighs]

27:53.673 --> 27:59.481
Paul, I know it looks dark.
But we're not giving up.

28:12.424 --> 28:13.949
What do you got?

28:13.984 --> 28:17.186
I lifted a partial print
from one of the envelopes.

28:17.220 --> 28:19.310
- You get an I.D.?
- No, but it contained the same

28:19.311 --> 28:21.323
barbecue-sauce residue as Paul's
print from the toilet handle.

28:21.358 --> 28:24.193
- So, either they both love soul food...
- Or they shared a meal together.

28:24.227 --> 28:26.595
Mm-hmm.
That's what I was thinking.

28:26.630 --> 28:30.232
Well, maybe I overlooked
someone from Paul's office.

28:30.267 --> 28:34.870
Like a staff member or a coworker.
Um, any clues from the letters?

28:34.905 --> 28:38.440
They reveal someone intelligent,
probably college-educated.

28:38.475 --> 28:40.276
She's clever, manipulative,

28:40.310 --> 28:43.312
and a woman who's clearly
disturbed and frustrated.

28:43.346 --> 28:45.347
You just described how
I feel about this case.

28:45.382 --> 28:46.849
[Chuckles]

28:46.883 --> 28:48.884
This was just delivered
for you at the front desk.

28:48.919 --> 28:51.453
- Ooh, thank you, Susie.
- Enjoy.

28:52.489 --> 28:56.225
- What's in the box?
- A gift... for you.

28:56.259 --> 29:00.596
- Why did you get me a gift?
- Because I realize

29:00.630 --> 29:03.365
that we need to live
every day to its fullest,

29:03.400 --> 29:06.769
so I got you something
from our bucket list. [taps]

29:06.803 --> 29:09.672
How could we have the same
thing on our bucket list?

29:09.706 --> 29:11.373
You said mine was stupid.

29:11.408 --> 29:13.409
I don't believe I ever
used the word "stupid."

29:13.443 --> 29:17.363
- Well, you said I need a new bucket list.
- I merely suggested

29:17.364 --> 29:21.250
that revisiting the list would
reveal some more exciting choices.

29:21.284 --> 29:22.651
Well, let's open it.

29:22.686 --> 29:24.620
- Oh ...
- Okay.

29:24.654 --> 29:27.256
- Later.
- Why later?

29:27.290 --> 29:29.959
You'll see.
[taps]

29:34.831 --> 29:37.933
[Door opens]

29:37.968 --> 29:41.837
Hey.
How'd it go with the job?

29:41.871 --> 29:46.375
- Huh?
- Yeah, well, the interview went well.

29:46.409 --> 29:49.345
- Yeah?
- I didn't get the job because

29:49.379 --> 29:51.914
they wanted somebody
with a college degree.

29:51.948 --> 29:58.821
- Oh, Ma. I'm so sorry.
- Well, it's okay.

29:58.855 --> 30:03.626
But I appreciate all your help, Frankie.
Thank you.

30:03.660 --> 30:06.762
Hey, I'm proud of you, how
you went after that job.

30:06.796 --> 30:08.964
And let me tell you something.

30:08.999 --> 30:11.400
No college degree is gonna compete

30:11.434 --> 30:14.003
with the PHD you have
in a life well-lived.

30:14.037 --> 30:18.540
- Thank you.
- You got this close on your first try.

30:18.575 --> 30:20.309
Who's to say you won't get the next one?

30:20.343 --> 30:22.011
Yeah, there's got to
be an employer out there

30:22.045 --> 30:26.015
- that will appreciate my life experience.
- You're darn right there is.

30:26.049 --> 30:28.017
[Sighs, chuckles]

30:28.051 --> 30:33.422
Okay, so, uh, when I find that job,
are you still willing to help me?

30:33.456 --> 30:34.423
[Chuckles]

30:34.457 --> 30:37.593
Absolutely.
Ma, of course.

30:37.627 --> 30:39.662
[Both laugh]

30:42.032 --> 30:44.600
<i>Frankie: Hey.</i>

30:44.634 --> 30:46.969
I heard the barbecue sauce
in both prints matched.

30:47.003 --> 30:50.005
<i>Korsak: Yeah, we talked to Paul.
He said the last time he ate barbecue</i>

30:50.040 --> 30:52.574
was at a fundraiser at City Hall
about a week before the murder.

30:52.609 --> 30:55.044
We talked to his secretary.
She gave us the guest list.

30:55.078 --> 30:57.980
- Turn up any new suspects?
- Yeah.

30:58.014 --> 31:00.582
Paul's wife, Carol,
was at the event with him.

31:00.617 --> 31:02.751
I'm not sure that makes
her a prime suspect.

31:02.786 --> 31:05.654
Not by itself.
We also asked the secretary

31:05.655 --> 31:08.157
if the building at 120 Broadstreet
meant anything to her.

31:08.158 --> 31:09.842
She said she remembered that's where

31:09.843 --> 31:11.527
Carol went to the
psychiatrist once a week.

31:11.561 --> 31:13.929
Sarah Daniels and the wife
saw doctors in the same building.

31:13.963 --> 31:15.764
Yeah, kind of more than a coincidence.

31:15.799 --> 31:18.367
You think that that's
where she stole Sarah's I.D.

31:18.401 --> 31:19.668
Here's why.

31:23.406 --> 31:26.375
- They could be sisters.
- Got her.

31:26.409 --> 31:29.678
I ran Carol's credit cards.
She rented a car several months ago.

31:29.713 --> 31:32.481
Rental agreement says it's
a small, red economy car,

31:32.515 --> 31:35.150
just like the one that Paul
thought was following him.

31:35.185 --> 31:36.785
So she knew about
the affair before we did.

31:36.820 --> 31:38.153
Yeah, which gives her plenty of motive,

31:38.188 --> 31:41.090
- gives her lots of time to plan this murder.
- It's a great theory,

31:41.124 --> 31:43.092
except Carol was home
the night of the murder.

31:44.761 --> 31:47.563
Yeah, there's that.
[Sighs]

31:48.598 --> 31:50.666
[Sighs]

31:53.103 --> 31:54.570
[Elevator bell dings]

31:54.604 --> 31:56.538
Paul's wife, Carol,
is our prime suspect.

31:56.573 --> 31:58.574
Well, that explains the barbecue sauce.

31:58.608 --> 32:00.943
We think she found out
Paul was having an affair

32:00.977 --> 32:03.679
and set out to destroy him with
his biggest courtroom success.

32:03.713 --> 32:06.832
- The cork murder.
- Yeah, but our biggest problem is that

32:06.833 --> 32:08.709
we don't have any forensic
evidence to tie her

32:08.710 --> 32:10.586
to the crime scene and
we can't crack her alibi.

32:10.620 --> 32:13.155
Yeah, she claims she was at
home playing online chess.

32:13.189 --> 32:17.294
Nina, can you play the
recording of Carol's chess game?

32:17.728 --> 32:20.763
We think that she had someone
play chess for her at home,

32:20.797 --> 32:22.064
but we don't know how to prove it.

32:22.098 --> 32:24.800
- How long did the match last?
- Over an hour.

32:37.247 --> 32:38.981
Pawn takes d-5.

32:41.117 --> 32:42.451
- Right on the money.
- Jane: Great.

32:42.485 --> 32:44.853
I knew you loved chess, but I
didn't know you were Clairvoyant.

32:44.888 --> 32:47.689
- [chuckles] How did you do that?
- Well, the moves

32:47.724 --> 32:50.492
are Boris Spassky
versus Bobby Fischer, 1970.

32:50.527 --> 32:53.562
Nina, can you fast-forward
to her next move?

32:53.596 --> 32:55.164
[Keyboard clacking]

32:55.198 --> 32:56.999
Pawn to e-4.

32:57.934 --> 33:01.470
[Chuckles]
I could do this all day.

33:01.504 --> 33:04.473
Again.
Pawn takes c-3.

33:04.507 --> 33:07.119
- Okay, now you're just showing off.
- I am.

33:07.237 --> 33:10.913
But, you know, she's following
Spassky's moves to a "T."

33:10.947 --> 33:13.882
Wait a minute.
Her opponent's moves play out randomly.

33:13.917 --> 33:17.586
But Carol's moves
happen exactly 30 seconds

33:17.620 --> 33:19.488
after her opponent moves.

33:19.522 --> 33:21.123
She just wanted to keep
the game going and credible.

33:21.157 --> 33:24.493
So she took Spassky's playbook
and preprogrammed the computer

33:24.527 --> 33:28.130
- to play the game automatically.
- Bye-bye, alibi.

33:28.164 --> 33:30.098
Later, later, perpetrator.

33:35.696 --> 33:37.597
Your wife's known about
the affair for months.

33:37.631 --> 33:41.701
No.
It's not possible.

33:41.735 --> 33:44.871
She rented a small, red economy car

33:44.905 --> 33:47.607
just like the one you thought
was following you and Danni

33:47.641 --> 33:49.359
to the hotel a while back.

33:49.668 --> 33:52.779
What I can't figure out is
why you didn't say anything

33:52.813 --> 33:54.380
when I told you about
the driver's license

33:54.415 --> 33:57.850
that was stolen at 120 Broadstreet,

33:57.885 --> 34:00.954
since your wife goes there
once a week to see her shrink.

34:01.188 --> 34:03.990
I was hoping it was a coincidence.

34:04.024 --> 34:05.858
Come on, Paul.
You're smarter than that.

34:08.929 --> 34:12.031
[Voice breaking]
I just didn't want it to be true.

34:13.534 --> 34:17.237
<i>I'm the one who lied, cheated.</i>

34:17.271 --> 34:20.340
The way I handled this, I...
I didn't want it

34:20.373 --> 34:22.609
to be the reason that the
woman I loved was dead.

34:22.643 --> 34:23.743
[Sighs]

34:25.813 --> 34:28.614
Have you told your wife
about your suspicions?

34:30.505 --> 34:31.650
No.

34:32.685 --> 34:37.147
Well, that's the first smart
thing you've done so far.

34:37.391 --> 34:39.659
<i>Paul: I just need five minutes.</i>

34:39.693 --> 34:41.561
- Leave me alone.
- Please, Carol.

34:41.594 --> 34:43.396
There's nothing left to say.

34:43.429 --> 34:46.532
Look, I know I handled this
the wrong way and I'm sorry!

34:52.072 --> 34:55.275
- I'm sorry.
- How could you do it?

34:55.309 --> 34:58.678
How could you just throw
away our life together,

34:58.712 --> 35:00.446
everything we built?

35:00.481 --> 35:02.482
The future that we planned ...
didn't it mean anything to you?

35:02.516 --> 35:06.052
- Didn't I mean anything to you?
- Of course you did.

35:06.086 --> 35:08.421
Then how could you turn
your back on me for her?

35:08.455 --> 35:10.423
<i>[Indistinct conversation]</i>

35:10.457 --> 35:12.725
Jane: How does it go so wrong

35:12.760 --> 35:16.329
between two people who
love each other so much?

35:16.363 --> 35:18.431
You're asking a guy who
was married three times.

35:18.465 --> 35:19.932
<i>Paul: I didn't want to hurt you.</i>

35:19.967 --> 35:21.567
Did you ever have this conversation?

35:21.602 --> 35:25.583
No, but I never cheated
on any of my wives.

35:25.618 --> 35:27.998
But I wasn't emotionally
available, either.

35:28.033 --> 35:32.078
Emotionally avail...
When did you start watching "Dr. Phil"?

35:32.112 --> 35:34.947
[Chuckling] That would be never.

35:34.982 --> 35:36.716
But Kiki helped me understand

35:36.750 --> 35:38.985
that my deepest emotional
fulfillment came from work.

35:39.019 --> 35:42.989
I often wonder if I could
have balanced a career

35:43.023 --> 35:45.458
and a marriage to Casey.

35:45.492 --> 35:47.493
That's something you would
have had to work on together.

35:47.528 --> 35:49.946
I think Kiki would point out
that Casey's own issues

35:49.947 --> 35:52.765
with marriage and career
complicated the relationship.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.100

35:54.134 --> 35:55.802
<i>I'm so sorry I hurt you, Carol.</i>

36:00.474 --> 36:02.475
What's the deal between you two?

36:02.509 --> 36:04.844
Is she becoming more than a "life coach?"

36:04.878 --> 36:07.747
Oh, Kiki has a strict rule
against dating clients.

36:07.781 --> 36:12.185
Mm.
Well, I think it's time you fired Kiki.

- Well, that can't be good.

36:19.059 --> 36:20.526
[Carol sighs]

36:20.561 --> 36:22.762
This is your way
of turning it all back on me.

36:22.796 --> 36:24.897
You have to play the good
guy so you don't feel so bad

36:24.932 --> 36:28.101
about running away
with that filthy whore.

36:28.135 --> 36:32.138
- She got what she deserved.
- You disgust me.

36:32.172 --> 36:36.042
I put a bag over her head,
and I squeezed it tight

36:36.076 --> 36:40.046
and I watched the life
drain from her body.

36:40.080 --> 36:43.149
And I felt fantastic.

36:43.183 --> 36:47.587
Enough!
Enough, Carol!

36:47.621 --> 36:51.924
I've lived with
a prosecutor for 15 years.

36:52.526 --> 36:55.162
I know you're wearing a wire.

37:00.734 --> 37:02.068
[Grunts]

37:02.102 --> 37:03.669
[Handcuffs click]

37:03.704 --> 37:06.072
- No!
- Don't you move!

37:09.443 --> 37:11.778
Paul, listen to me.

37:11.812 --> 37:15.148
Come on.
I jumped off a bridge

37:15.182 --> 37:16.682
<i>because I did not believe
that you were a murderer.</i>

37:16.717 --> 37:18.918
Please don't prove me wrong.
Please!

37:20.187 --> 37:22.688
<i>Think about Danielle.</i>

37:22.723 --> 37:26.726
Just ... think about Danielle, okay?

37:26.760 --> 37:31.564
She wouldn't want this.
She loved you so much.

37:31.598 --> 37:34.000
<i>She wouldn't want this. Come on.</i>

37:34.034 --> 37:35.768
If she were here right now, she ...

37:35.803 --> 37:37.770
she would be begging
for you to put that gun down.

37:37.805 --> 37:40.173
Please, Paul.
Please ... please put it down.

37:40.207 --> 37:43.252
Please. It's not worth it.

37:43.687 --> 37:46.915
It's not worth it.

37:50.517 --> 37:52.685
[Crying]

37:52.719 --> 37:54.921
[Sirens wailing]

38:15.042 --> 38:19.145
- What a tragedy.
- It just reminds us

38:19.179 --> 38:22.048
that there are
consequences to our actions.

38:22.082 --> 38:24.584
Yeah, but I'm not sure
I'll ever understand

38:24.618 --> 38:26.619
how two people can start out in love

38:26.653 --> 38:29.689
and then end up doing such
terrible things to each other.

38:29.923 --> 38:33.526
It wouldn't be the first time.
Okay!

38:33.560 --> 38:35.928
I came over here for
more than just food.

38:35.963 --> 38:38.631
- Really?
- Maura!

38:38.665 --> 38:39.999
Please, can we open my gift now?

38:40.533 --> 38:42.668
It's right in front of you.

38:44.259 --> 38:49.809
Oh, it's a ... shiny kitchen thingy.

38:49.843 --> 38:51.043
It's a pasta maker!

38:51.078 --> 38:53.595
- Really?
- Yes. You said

38:53.630 --> 38:56.034
you wanted to learn how
to make homemade ravioli.

38:56.183 --> 38:58.217
Thank you.

38:58.252 --> 39:00.620
I'll roll out the dough, and then
you can put it through the machine.

39:00.654 --> 39:02.054
All right.

39:02.089 --> 39:05.258
And for our stuffing,
I got us lobster, duck,

39:05.292 --> 39:07.093
chanterelle mushrooms,

39:07.127 --> 39:10.796
and your favorite,
sausage and ricotta cheese.

39:10.831 --> 39:12.265
Yum. Mmm.

39:13.299 --> 39:18.604
- So, did you bring your bucket list?
- Yes.

39:18.639 --> 39:21.908
But I know
you're gonna make fun of it.

39:21.942 --> 39:23.543
Oh, no, I'm not.

39:23.577 --> 39:26.045
I may have some constructive
criticism, but...

39:27.714 --> 39:30.216
There you go.
There's mine.

39:30.250 --> 39:33.953
- Wow. And you typed it.
- Hmm.

39:36.857 --> 39:40.226
Mm. Well, these
are rather interesting.

39:40.260 --> 39:43.896
The first thing on your list
is to do something from my list.

39:43.931 --> 39:45.698
Yeah, that's why we're
making homemade ravioli.

39:45.732 --> 39:48.032
I think it will be fun

39:48.067 --> 39:50.670
- to do stuff from each other's list.
- Really?

39:50.704 --> 39:52.905
No! I'm not going
to Paris Fashion Week.

39:52.940 --> 39:55.704
I can't believe that you
want to do Navy Seal training.

39:55.739 --> 39:57.843
Oh, okay.
So there's this place in San Diego,

39:57.878 --> 39:59.946
and they put civilians
through hell week.

39:59.980 --> 40:02.582
Hell is something I'm trying to avoid.

40:02.616 --> 40:04.116
Running of the bulls in Pamplona?

40:04.151 --> 40:07.920
- An adventure in Spain, yes.
- Mm!

40:07.955 --> 40:11.090
- But being chased by angry bulls, no.
- Pbht!

40:11.124 --> 40:12.892
The museum of antiquities in Leiden.

40:12.926 --> 40:15.729
I am not spending my vacation in some

40:15.730 --> 40:21.666
dust-filled old museu...
Oh! Zip-lining in Costa Rica!

40:22.279 --> 40:24.765
Mhm.
[sighs]

40:24.885 --> 40:27.237
[gasps]
I have an idea.

40:27.387 --> 40:29.653
This is something that
neither one of us have done

40:29.754 --> 40:31.790
and could be appealing to both of us.

40:32.723 --> 40:35.101
An archeological dig in Egypt.

40:37.418 --> 40:41.743
I-I am fascinated with ancient
culture and you love adventures.

40:42.409 --> 40:45.455
- Can I get that Indiana Jones' hat?
- We both do.

40:45.627 --> 40:47.463
- I'm in.
- Yeah!

40:47.553 --> 40:49.451
- Give me some dough.
- Alright.

40:49.459 --> 40:52.446
- I accidentally broke it.
- How did you already brake it?

40:52.599 --> 40:55.565
Well I don't...
You've buyed a broken stuff!

40:57.519 --> 41:00.041
- This fits in here. Hold up...
- Okay, it's in.

41:01.108 --> 41:03.166
- Aaah. Look at this.
- Oh my god!

41:03.201 --> 41:04.876
My mother is gonna be so proud.

41:04.911 --> 41:06.687
- Yeah! Look at that!
- Yeah!

41:07.342 --> 41:09.637
Maura: Oh. Look at that.
