00:03.190 --> 00:04.490
- <i>Previously on</i> Burden of Truth.
<i>- The field was poisoned by Matheson Steel.</i>

00:04.550 --> 00:06.090
They don't want it
to be the Mill

00:06.160 --> 00:09.160
- <i>and they are not going to be rational.</i>
- Have a nice day.

00:09.160 --> 00:11.630
<i>Losing Steve was hard
on all of us, especially you.</i>

00:11.690 --> 00:14.460
<i>I need to know if the people
who chewed the gum are related.</i>

00:14.530 --> 00:17.570
<i>- She deserves to know.
- Not until I have evidence, Billy.</i>

00:17.630 --> 00:19.470
Hey, guys.

00:19.540 --> 00:22.270
Your father sent me, Jo,
and we're not here to win.

00:22.270 --> 00:24.170
We're here to destroy you.

00:26.210 --> 00:28.140
Dr. Williams gets here
in an hour.

00:28.210 --> 00:31.210
Once he can link the girl's symptoms to
the benzene, we're off to the races.

00:31.280 --> 00:33.210
You're worried about
this frivolous lawsuit charge

00:33.220 --> 00:35.080
from CTS?

00:35.150 --> 00:37.550
If we lose tomorrow,
their next move is to sue me.

00:39.620 --> 00:41.990
I know this isn't
what you signed up for:

00:42.060 --> 00:44.090
going up against
your old law firm.

00:44.090 --> 00:46.090
I should have known
that my father wouldn't let me

00:46.160 --> 00:48.800
get away so easily.

00:51.530 --> 00:53.400
Billy, is that...?

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:22.530 --> 01:24.670
Is anything missing?

01:24.730 --> 01:27.100
My laptop.

01:27.170 --> 01:29.140
And my trial strategy
for the case.

01:29.140 --> 01:31.470
I map it out
on a yellow legal pad.

01:31.540 --> 01:33.340
Yeah, looks like
boys being boys.

01:35.450 --> 01:37.750
We had a pipe
thrown through our window,

01:37.750 --> 01:39.780
and we've received
death threats.

01:39.850 --> 01:42.280
Still just "boys being boys"?

01:42.350 --> 01:45.890
Not much we can do...

01:45.960 --> 01:48.790
but give you
a copy of the report.

01:51.330 --> 01:53.600
Can you think of anyone
who might want to do this?

01:55.670 --> 01:57.570
CTS.

01:57.630 --> 02:00.440
- Who's that?
- My old law firm.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.540
Law firm that breaks the law.
It's indictable.

02:03.610 --> 02:06.040
Yeah, but we'll never
catch them.

02:06.110 --> 02:08.039
- They're not sloppy like that.
- I'll snoop around,

02:08.039 --> 02:10.240
- ask some questions.
- Yeah, you'll need

02:10.250 --> 02:13.450
to get a locksmith in.
Stewart's pretty good.

02:13.520 --> 02:16.890
Possibly still sober.
Let's all have a good day now.

02:21.090 --> 02:23.260
You really think
CTS brought goons to Millwood?

02:23.330 --> 02:26.190
Why bother when they can just

02:26.260 --> 02:28.530
roll into the Boot and "suggest"

02:28.530 --> 02:30.830
that Billy Crawford deserves
what he has coming?

02:30.900 --> 02:32.870
I never would have thought

02:32.870 --> 02:36.000
- people here would go for that.
- People everywhere go for that.

02:36.010 --> 02:38.340
It's called crappy human nature.

02:38.340 --> 02:40.810
Looks like
I'm interrupting something.

02:40.810 --> 02:42.810
I'm afraid to ask what.

02:42.880 --> 02:44.580
Yeah, we had a bit
of a break-in.

02:44.650 --> 02:47.350
Ah, sheesh, Joanna,
you've only been here 5 minutes.

02:47.350 --> 02:49.520
- Oh, what can I say?
- Billy Crawford.

02:49.590 --> 02:52.420
- Calvin Williams. - Thank you
for coming on such short notice.

02:52.420 --> 02:55.020
Yeah, of course.♪♪♪

02:55.030 --> 02:57.260
Well, let's not waste time.

02:57.330 --> 02:59.260
Where are the girls?

03:04.300 --> 03:06.870
Hey, guys.
This is Dr. Williams.

03:06.940 --> 03:09.700
- Oh, please, call me Cal.
- Great, another doctor.

03:11.340 --> 03:13.170
You have every right
to be frustrated,

03:13.180 --> 03:15.480
and I know you're desperate
for answers,

03:15.540 --> 03:17.610
but before I make a proper
diagnosis, I'm gonna need to

03:17.680 --> 03:20.110
- speak to each of you one on one.
- So, this is therapy?

03:20.180 --> 03:22.850
It's a neuropsychological assessment
of your psychogenic movement disorder.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.650
Yeah, it's what I said.

03:25.720 --> 03:28.390
OK, I'm ready to start
if that's all right.

03:28.460 --> 03:30.930
- Yes.
- Why don't we start with you.

03:30.990 --> 03:33.530
Hmm?♪♪♪

03:33.600 --> 03:35.800
Follow me.

03:39.870 --> 03:41.840
When did your symptoms
first start?

03:43.470 --> 03:45.670
Right after
the vaccine clinic.

03:45.680 --> 03:49.440
It was just my hands at first,
and then it got worse...

03:49.510 --> 03:51.480
and worse.

03:51.550 --> 03:53.880
But you hid your symptoms?

03:56.150 --> 03:58.020
Why?

04:01.920 --> 04:03.220
Full...

04:05.630 --> 04:08.700
Full-ride soccer
scholarship to McGill.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.730
Didn't want to blow that.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.870
Yeah. I don't blame you.

04:13.940 --> 04:16.100
Was there anything else
going on at school?

04:19.910 --> 04:22.440
Molly?

04:22.510 --> 04:25.080
This is a safe space.

04:27.450 --> 04:29.380
People were talking a lot.

04:29.450 --> 04:31.520
What were they talking about?

04:31.590 --> 04:33.790
- What do you mean?
- The kids at school,

04:33.860 --> 04:36.290
what was on everyone's mind?

04:38.190 --> 04:40.630
Steve died.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.730
Everyone was talking
about that, I guess.

04:42.800 --> 04:45.070
- Steve?
- Star athlete.

04:45.070 --> 04:49.000
He was warm, cute.

04:49.070 --> 04:51.470
You know, that guy.

04:51.470 --> 04:53.780
I understand.

04:56.080 --> 04:58.080
Must have been hard to lose
someone like that.

05:01.220 --> 05:03.620
Everyone was in shock,
you know?

05:05.620 --> 05:07.220
Because of how.

05:08.860 --> 05:09.890
How?

05:09.960 --> 05:12.830
Ummm...

05:12.900 --> 05:14.960
how what?

05:15.030 --> 05:17.370
How did Steve Magnus die?

05:33.650 --> 05:34.980
So?

05:35.050 --> 05:37.450
Well, as I suspected,

05:37.450 --> 05:39.450
speaking with the girls
has given me the full picture.

05:39.460 --> 05:42.360
Great. We'll get
your affidavit today,

05:42.430 --> 05:44.490
and we'll be ready
for court tomorrow.

05:44.560 --> 05:46.460
I'm sorry, Joanna,
but the full picture doesn't

05:46.530 --> 05:49.160
indicate benzene poisoning.♪♪♪

05:49.230 --> 05:51.170
- What are you talking about?
- I believe the girls

05:51.230 --> 05:54.640
- are suffering from conversion disorder.
- What's that?

05:54.700 --> 05:56.270
It's a psychological reaction
to trauma.

05:56.270 --> 05:58.740
- You say it's in their heads?
- He says we don't have a case.

05:58.810 --> 06:01.880
You don't.
But we may have a cure.

06:01.940 --> 06:04.080
You were supposed
to link the benzene

06:04.080 --> 06:06.180
to the girls' symptoms,
not come up with a new theory.

06:06.250 --> 06:09.520
This is a clear case of a close-knit
community of girls responding lock-step

06:09.520 --> 06:11.950
- to a shared trauma.
- I can't believe this.

06:12.020 --> 06:14.560
I'm sorry, Joanna, but it's a
textbook psychological response.

06:14.620 --> 06:18.290
- PTSD, mass hysteria...
- My niece is not hysterical.

06:18.360 --> 06:21.830
In most cases, psychological stress
presents as physical symptoms.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.770
We'll get you
on the next plane out.

06:25.770 --> 06:29.400
- Thank you for taking the time.
- I can treat these girls.

06:29.470 --> 06:31.370
It's what I do,
I just need a few days.

06:31.440 --> 06:34.580
A lawsuit is only gonna make
things more stressful for them.

06:39.010 --> 06:41.080
You're making a big mistake.

06:49.130 --> 06:50.990
We won't be able to find
a new medical expert

06:51.060 --> 06:52.930
before tomorrow.

06:52.930 --> 06:54.860
We have a great trial strategy

06:54.930 --> 06:56.860
so let's just stick to the plan.

06:56.870 --> 06:58.930
We'll just have to make do
with the local doctor.

07:00.900 --> 07:02.800
We'll try to rebuild
our case notes from memory

07:02.870 --> 07:04.770
and whatever's left
of our office.

07:04.840 --> 07:06.870
There's nothing
to this cure, right?

07:06.940 --> 07:08.910
Billy,

07:08.980 --> 07:11.580
we found toxic barrels
in the girls' athletic field.

07:11.650 --> 07:15.620
- Amanda never played sports. - That
doesn't mean she wasn't on the field.

07:19.560 --> 07:21.460
Don't lose heart
on me now, Counselor.

07:37.840 --> 07:40.040
Oof! Mom, we're out
of eggs again.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.280
And milk.

07:42.340 --> 07:45.110
And everything
except for Sriracha.

07:45.180 --> 07:47.620
Well, that's what happens

07:47.680 --> 07:49.980
when you sue the place
that used to pay me:

07:50.050 --> 07:52.320
work dries up
and so do the groceries.

07:55.990 --> 07:57.990
Lucky for you...

08:01.460 --> 08:03.930
...I have some savings.

Great job. - Should have thought about

08:19.110 --> 08:21.620
Mom, you know,
I'm just trying to help Molly.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.820
Yeah. You don't even care who
else you hurt in the process.

08:23.890 --> 08:27.090
Who taught you that? Hmm?

08:27.090 --> 08:29.090
Because it sure
as hell wasn't me.

08:36.630 --> 08:39.169
Oh! What happened here?

08:39.230 --> 08:41.169
Someone broke in.

08:41.169 --> 08:44.810
And did some fab redecorating.

08:44.870 --> 08:47.580
- Sorry.
- Are you moving in?

- What's with the bag?
- Uh, no, I, um...

08:50.610 --> 08:52.510
I need a break from my mom.

08:52.520 --> 08:55.320
What are you looking for?

08:55.380 --> 08:58.350
There are some backup CT scans
that we did in one of these boxes.

08:58.420 --> 09:01.190
- Let me help.
- Thanks.

09:01.260 --> 09:03.190
I ran away once.

09:03.260 --> 09:05.160
I'm 18, it's not running away.

09:05.230 --> 09:08.460
- Hmm...
- It's not.

09:08.530 --> 09:12.000
I was 10, maybe 11.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.470
My parents were fighting and
I got sick of it, so I took off.

09:14.540 --> 09:16.740
My mom found me
a couple of hours later

09:16.810 --> 09:18.810
holed up
in Ms. Gamache's backyard.

09:18.870 --> 09:20.810

09:27.580 --> 09:31.020
She started crying,
so I started crying.

09:31.090 --> 09:33.390
And then she made me dumplings
and taught me

09:33.460 --> 09:35.360
how to use chopsticks
for the rest of the day.

09:35.420 --> 09:38.430
I still can't use those.
I always ask for a fork.

09:38.490 --> 09:41.960
Well, took me
all afternoon to learn.

09:42.030 --> 09:43.900
She was, uh,

09:43.970 --> 09:45.900
she was so patient.

09:50.440 --> 09:53.240
Said that chopsticks work best
when they're together.

10:00.180 --> 10:03.520
- A DNA test, is this what you're
looking for? - No, that's not it.

10:10.060 --> 10:13.960
- Oh! Uhhh, what about this one?
- Yeah, that's it.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.900
Nice work.

10:18.370 --> 10:20.530
Where are you going?

10:21.940 --> 10:23.940

10:30.410 --> 10:33.080
You know, you don't have to
come if you don't feel like it.

10:33.080 --> 10:35.620
You said it was important
for me to be seen in court.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.620
- Sympathy and all that.
- Right.

10:37.620 --> 10:40.850
The most important thing is
that you take care of yourself.

10:40.920 --> 10:44.090
That's what you're here for.
You're not just my lawyer;

10:44.160 --> 10:46.760
you're also my bodyguard.

10:46.830 --> 10:48.800
And my chauffeur.

10:50.970 --> 10:53.500
- Will I have to take the stand?
- No, this hearing

10:53.570 --> 10:56.040
is to determine whether we have
the grounds to bring a lawsuit.

10:56.040 --> 10:58.610
- And if not?
- If not, my father gets

10:58.670 --> 11:00.510
to sue us for frivolous charges.

11:00.580 --> 11:02.510
- One thing at a time.
- I'm gonna start

11:02.580 --> 11:05.380
by presenting our timeline,
then throw the medical expert.

11:05.450 --> 11:07.920

11:07.920 --> 11:09.780

11:09.850 --> 11:11.920
You don't know CTS like I do.

11:11.990 --> 11:13.620
And they don't know me
from Billy Idol.

11:13.690 --> 11:15.660
They'll know

11:15.730 --> 11:17.890
all your moves.

11:17.960 --> 11:21.400
Fine. But if you get into
trouble, I'm bailing you out.

11:21.460 --> 11:23.930
They're gonna try
and get in your head.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.600
Ignore them. Stay focused
on the judge. Eye on the prize.

11:44.650 --> 11:47.720

I see you're wearing the same suit
you wore on Freehorn vs. Metcalf.

11:51.390 --> 11:54.200
That's right.
It's my lucky suit.

11:55.700 --> 11:57.670
All luck runs out.

11:59.570 --> 12:02.100
Your Honour,
we have a last-minute expert

12:02.170 --> 12:04.670
- to add to defense.
- There's no call

12:04.740 --> 12:06.710
for experts or witnesses.
Save that for trial.

12:06.780 --> 12:08.910
We motion to strike the claim

12:08.910 --> 12:10.840
due to the prosecution's

12:10.850 --> 12:12.850
dishonest representation
of the facts.

12:12.850 --> 12:15.750
Counselor Crawford,
did you submit a false claim?

12:15.750 --> 12:19.190
- I would never do that.
- We have evidence to the contrary.

12:19.260 --> 12:21.120
If you're telling the truth,
then you have nothing to fear.

12:21.190 --> 12:24.360
Counselor, bring in your expert.

12:27.000 --> 12:29.330
They won't let us take an inch
without a fight.

12:29.400 --> 12:32.200
Welcome to the show.

12:53.020 --> 12:55.620
Rangers Pawn Shop was a

12:55.630 --> 12:58.490
- Did you find anything?
- Thought I told you to drop it.

12:58.560 --> 13:02.160
Uh, no, you said
it was a waste of time.

13:02.230 --> 13:04.100
Now, I'm telling you.
Drop it.

13:09.610 --> 13:13.210
<i>Uh, it was the start
of senior year.</i>

13:13.280 --> 13:16.240
<i>I was finally supposed to make the
varsity volleyball team, but then...</i>

13:17.950 --> 13:20.510
<i>It's like this burst</i>

13:20.580 --> 13:23.550
<i>of lightning up my spine.</i>

13:23.620 --> 13:25.550
<i>I can't do anything to stop it.</i>

13:27.660 --> 13:29.990
This patient is one of
four girls from the little town

13:30.060 --> 13:32.390
of Cottonhead
about two hours from here.

13:32.460 --> 13:36.500
She presented with unexplained
tremors, seizures and fainting.

13:36.570 --> 13:38.670
- No one knew why.
- And how long

13:38.730 --> 13:41.670
- had she been like this?
- About two years.

13:41.740 --> 13:45.240
But once I diagnosed her
with conversion disorder,

13:45.310 --> 13:48.240
we had it under control
in a matter of months.

13:48.310 --> 13:50.410
The second I met Molly Ross,

13:50.480 --> 13:52.350
I knew we were dealing
with the exact same thing.

13:52.410 --> 13:54.620
Your Honour, the doctor barely
met with them for 10 minutes

13:54.680 --> 13:56.620
before snapping
to this conclusion.

13:56.620 --> 13:59.590
Your Honor, he met with them
for over an hour

13:59.660 --> 14:01.820
after extensive analysis
of the medical records.

14:01.890 --> 14:03.860
And where did you get
those medical records?

14:03.930 --> 14:05.830
- From our office?
- I don't like

14:05.890 --> 14:07.830
what you're insinuating,
Counselor.

14:07.830 --> 14:10.030
Gentlemen, this is
a courtroom, not a bar.

14:10.030 --> 14:13.170
- Please behave accordingly.
- Your Honour, we removed

14:13.240 --> 14:16.170
toxic barrels
from the girls' athletic field.

14:16.240 --> 14:19.540
Excuse me. To be more specific,

14:19.610 --> 14:22.980
it was actually the defense's own waste
management team that removed the barrels.

14:23.050 --> 14:25.380
The motion to dismiss
is unfounded

14:25.450 --> 14:28.550
as we believe...
we believe they lack

14:28.620 --> 14:30.520
- sufficient documentation to...
- Counselor Hanley,

14:30.590 --> 14:33.120
do you have something you'd like
to share with the class?

14:35.960 --> 14:39.260
Your Honour, the defense
has not released their response

14:39.330 --> 14:41.260
to the prosecution.
Considering the lack

14:41.330 --> 14:43.300
of documentation involved,

14:43.370 --> 14:45.530
there is no reason
to withhold this testimony,

14:45.600 --> 14:48.300
unless they are trying
to limit our access

14:48.370 --> 14:50.300
to a flawed argument.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.010
Despite your bad manners,

14:56.080 --> 14:58.680
I agree.

14:58.750 --> 15:01.480
Counselor Crawford,
if I give you the weekend

15:01.480 --> 15:03.480
to examine
the defense's response,

15:03.490 --> 15:05.650
- will that work for you?
- Yes, Your Honour.

15:05.720 --> 15:08.990
Then, we'll resume
Monday morning.

15:11.330 --> 15:12.860
Looks like you're gonna
be here for a while.

15:12.930 --> 15:16.560
I hope you brought another suit.

15:16.630 --> 15:19.030
You're trying
to win a lawsuit;

15:19.100 --> 15:21.540
- I'm trying to cure these girls.
- Oh, please.

15:21.600 --> 15:24.770
If Molly's symptoms go on
untreated, they'll only get worse.

15:28.140 --> 15:30.510
We need to find every paper
he's ever written

15:30.510 --> 15:33.150
on conversion disorder
and find a way to debunk it.

15:36.420 --> 15:38.420
There's a cure?

15:40.160 --> 15:42.520
It's just a trial strategy.

15:42.530 --> 15:45.130
It's meant to throw doubt
on the prosecution's story.

15:46.730 --> 15:48.530
You're sure there's
no truth to it?

15:48.600 --> 15:52.100
Hmm, come on.♪♪♪

16:13.020 --> 16:14.690
Doctor.

16:17.530 --> 16:19.460
Are you serious about this cure?

16:27.370 --> 16:29.370
- What's the catch?
- There's no catch.

16:29.440 --> 16:32.810
- This is about your niece's health.
- You guys talking about me?

16:37.380 --> 16:39.310
What are you doing for dinner?

16:42.220 --> 16:44.120
I thought you'd never ask.

16:54.900 --> 16:58.200
Aaah... I love this spot.

16:58.200 --> 17:00.470
Sometimes, I talk my kids
into coming here

17:00.540 --> 17:02.500
"for the best catch
of the season."

17:02.570 --> 17:04.270
You lie to your kids?

17:04.339 --> 17:06.740
On a daily basis.

17:06.810 --> 17:08.940
And just because no one's
ever caught anything here

17:08.940 --> 17:11.650
doesn't mean no one ever will.

17:11.710 --> 17:14.010
Besides, a little disappointment

17:14.079 --> 17:15.849
is good for them.
Builds character.

17:15.920 --> 17:18.990
You're sure you have
a psychology degree?

17:19.050 --> 17:21.050
Oh yeah. Test me.

17:21.119 --> 17:22.990
Transference, projection,

17:23.060 --> 17:25.359
everything pretty much
comes back to your mother.

17:25.359 --> 17:27.460
OK.

17:27.530 --> 17:29.960
Then tell me this, Freud:

17:29.970 --> 17:32.030
how do I debunk
conversion disorder?

17:32.100 --> 17:35.570
Debunking a legitimate
psychological disorder

17:35.570 --> 17:37.810
in one evening?
We may need more wine for that.

17:39.980 --> 17:43.210
There's got to be some way
to get them off our back.

17:44.580 --> 17:46.580
The human brain is so complex,

17:46.650 --> 17:49.920
we're only beginning
to understand its potential.

17:49.920 --> 17:52.520
And what happened
in Millwood is so rare.

17:52.590 --> 17:54.990
That's why it went
undiagnosed for so long.

17:55.060 --> 17:56.990
But it's also very exciting.

17:56.990 --> 17:59.060
Yeah, it's a real treat.

17:59.060 --> 18:01.060
So you're saying
it's all in Molly's head?

18:01.130 --> 18:03.730
Absolutely.

18:03.800 --> 18:05.430
I'm not faking it.

18:07.070 --> 18:09.000
Conversion disorder
affects the brain.

18:09.070 --> 18:11.000
Brain's in the head.

18:11.070 --> 18:13.040
All right, let's pretend

18:13.110 --> 18:15.110
that Molly does have
this conversion disorder.

18:15.180 --> 18:17.010
What could you
actually do to help?

18:17.080 --> 18:18.780
I can help you
get your power back.

18:18.850 --> 18:20.850
- How?
- Well, the brain

18:20.920 --> 18:22.680
has incredible influence
over the body.

18:22.750 --> 18:25.520
Right now, you're just
out of rhythm, that's all.

18:25.590 --> 18:27.290
Right.

18:27.290 --> 18:29.360
Close your eyes.

18:29.360 --> 18:31.760
- Is she getting sleepy?
- I'm gonna need silence

18:31.830 --> 18:34.260
- for this to work.
- Just let me try this, OK?

18:40.440 --> 18:43.100
You're alone
in a movie theatre.

18:45.170 --> 18:47.240
It's silent.

18:47.310 --> 18:50.110
You smell burnt butter,

18:50.180 --> 18:52.380
spilled soda.
Do you "see" that?

18:54.280 --> 18:57.120
The lights are
beginning to fade.

18:57.190 --> 19:00.590
Look up at the screen,
there's a line down the middle,

19:00.590 --> 19:03.160
and you're up there
on the screen.

19:03.230 --> 19:05.290
Do you see yourself?

19:05.360 --> 19:07.730
You're twitching.

19:07.730 --> 19:10.730
Put yourself on the left side
of that line.

19:10.800 --> 19:12.930
Keep yourself there.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.940
Don't worry about the twitching.

19:15.000 --> 19:18.170
Just look at yourself
left of that line.

19:20.210 --> 19:22.210
Now focus on the right side
of that line.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.880
The emptiness.

19:25.880 --> 19:28.880
Negative space.

19:28.950 --> 19:31.150
Focus there.

19:31.220 --> 19:33.090
See the abyss,

19:33.160 --> 19:37.160
the nothingness.

19:56.250 --> 19:58.180
<i>There must be something
I can dig up on Williams.</i>

19:58.250 --> 20:00.710
Everybody has a dirty secret
they don't want found.

20:00.780 --> 20:03.820
to get away from the dirty tricks.

20:05.590 --> 20:07.590
You're right.

20:07.660 --> 20:10.790
I know where all the bodies
are buried.

20:10.790 --> 20:13.530
I don't have to get Williams
if I can get Alan.

20:13.530 --> 20:16.060
That's not what I meant.

20:16.130 --> 20:18.800
My father is hell bent
on making an example of me;

20:18.800 --> 20:22.140
I can't fight that kind
of ambition with principles.

20:24.410 --> 20:26.440
Maybe...

20:26.510 --> 20:29.440
but it sounds like

20:29.510 --> 20:31.480
mutually assured destruction.

20:33.520 --> 20:37.150
Maybe you're right.
Old habits...

20:37.220 --> 20:38.920
Yeah.

20:53.270 --> 20:56.200
Are we gonna talk
about dinner tonight or...?

20:56.270 --> 20:59.870
I'm gonna need loads
of therapy from growing up here,

20:59.940 --> 21:02.640
so I may as well start now.

21:02.710 --> 21:05.080
I just think it's a bad idea

21:05.150 --> 21:07.080
to let him into your mind.

21:07.150 --> 21:09.920
He seems super sketch.

21:14.120 --> 21:17.360
- OK, say you're dying of thirst.
- OK.

21:17.430 --> 21:19.960
Would you follow the Devil
to water in the desert?

21:20.030 --> 21:22.730
I'm sorry, Reverend,

21:22.730 --> 21:25.130
what the hell was that?

21:25.130 --> 21:26.800
- I'm serious!
- I think

21:26.800 --> 21:29.570
- you're still hypnotized.
- Shut up.

21:31.340 --> 21:34.740
You know, all those plans we
made to go to Montreal together?

21:34.740 --> 21:36.580
Mm-hmm?

21:39.380 --> 21:42.950
I still wanna be the doctor.

21:43.020 --> 21:46.690
I wanna help other athletes
get back on the field,

21:46.760 --> 21:49.020
and I could work the Olympics.

21:51.760 --> 21:54.460
That doesn't just go away
because I'm sick.

22:00.840 --> 22:03.900
Oh, day drinking,
such a delight.

22:03.970 --> 22:05.970
Haha!

22:06.040 --> 22:08.440
- Ah?
- Uhhh...

22:08.440 --> 22:10.440
What are you
trouble makers up to?

22:10.510 --> 22:12.850
- Good night, Owen.
- Thanks for coming.

22:12.910 --> 22:16.320
I can't have Millwood's favourite guidance
counselor arrested for a DUI on my watch.

22:16.320 --> 22:18.250
I can think of worse things
than being cuffed

22:18.250 --> 22:20.650
in your back seat.

23:12.980 --> 23:16.180
"21E 7AB."

23:37.730 --> 23:39.730
Heard you put a BOLO out
on a plate.

23:39.740 --> 23:42.740
Yeah. Hanley got
a good look.

23:42.740 --> 23:44.740
So, you got anything?

23:44.810 --> 23:46.970
Are you still messing around

23:47.040 --> 23:49.610
with this, uh, Hanley break-in?

23:49.610 --> 23:51.580
Break-in escalated
to an assault.

23:51.650 --> 23:54.280
So... we got anything?

23:54.350 --> 23:56.280
You know, dispatch said
those plates don't exist,

23:56.290 --> 23:58.280
so maybe you wrote it
down wrong.

23:58.290 --> 24:00.290
We all make mistakes.

24:00.360 --> 24:02.090
Haha!

24:29.120 --> 24:30.580
Settlement offer?

24:35.990 --> 24:38.830
I saw some kids playing
hopscotch on the way here,

24:38.890 --> 24:42.060
but all I could think about
was how kid Joanna probably

24:42.130 --> 24:44.260
spent her time making sure
the squares were regulation.

24:49.240 --> 24:51.910
You remember that last case
we did with Williams?

24:51.970 --> 24:54.410
- Mm-hmm.
- Our case was in shambles

24:54.480 --> 24:57.640
until Williams saved us with that
flawless story on the stand.

24:59.880 --> 25:02.550
Where did that come from?
Was that us?

25:04.690 --> 25:07.650
We choose experts who will tell
us what we need all the time.

25:07.660 --> 25:10.290
- And then those experts take an oath to tell the truth.
- We don't get

25:10.360 --> 25:12.630
emotionally involved,
it clouds your judgement.

25:12.690 --> 25:14.630
You sent people to my office
to take my notes.

25:14.630 --> 25:16.930
- I had nothing to do with that.
- To my hotel, and you tell me

25:17.000 --> 25:20.600
not to get emotionally involved?

25:20.670 --> 25:24.040
You're the one in the Mill
town who's suing the Mill.

25:27.710 --> 25:30.540
I'm gonna prove to the judge
that Williams perjured himself

25:30.610 --> 25:32.850
on the stand,
and that you and I coached him.

25:32.910 --> 25:34.950
That would destroy
our careers.

25:36.990 --> 25:39.050
Drop the motion to dismiss,

25:39.050 --> 25:41.450
you know my application
is solid.

25:41.520 --> 25:43.460
Nah.

25:45.230 --> 25:47.130
There's no way you'd do that.

25:47.200 --> 25:49.360
You love the law too much.

25:51.530 --> 25:54.000
Watch me.

26:06.880 --> 26:09.250
Hey.

26:09.320 --> 26:10.880
Where is she?

26:10.890 --> 26:12.920
Gerrilynn. Hi.

26:12.920 --> 26:16.420
- Luna hasn't been home.
- She's not with me.

26:16.490 --> 26:19.030
I might see her later if
you want me to give a message?

26:19.030 --> 26:21.590
Your lawsuit
is going to turn everyone

26:21.660 --> 26:24.600
against her. This is our home.

26:40.350 --> 26:43.450
Luna's trying to do
the right thing. We all are.

26:43.450 --> 26:45.650
And what would you know about
doing the right thing?

26:45.720 --> 26:49.590
Where were you when she was
a baby and we had nothing?

26:49.660 --> 26:52.030
She's a Spence.
Not a Hanley.

26:52.090 --> 26:54.860
- Your dad made sure of that.
- My father isn't here.

26:54.930 --> 26:57.030
I'm looking right at him.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.100
Stay away from my daughter.

27:18.450 --> 27:20.320
Is this true?

27:21.960 --> 27:23.490
I don't know.

27:23.490 --> 27:25.490
You're the only person
who knows.

27:25.490 --> 27:29.100
And my mom,

27:29.160 --> 27:31.700
she's lied to me about this
my entire life.

27:38.040 --> 27:39.970
Why didn't you just tell me?

27:42.380 --> 27:45.110
I was trying to protect you

27:45.180 --> 27:47.110
until I knew for sure.

27:50.920 --> 27:53.020
- According to this...
- Don't!

27:57.890 --> 27:59.760
If it's a no, then...

28:05.170 --> 28:07.370
...Luna, then you aren't
my little sister.

28:09.600 --> 28:10.970
But...

28:13.210 --> 28:16.480
...either way,
there's no happy ending.

28:20.680 --> 28:23.780
- Joanna, please.
- I'm sorry.

28:28.890 --> 28:30.820
Not as sorry as I am.

28:46.370 --> 28:49.640
I can't believe
Joanna didn't tell me.

28:49.710 --> 28:52.550
And my mom... all these years...

28:52.610 --> 28:54.110
Lou.

28:54.180 --> 28:56.150
I don't even know
how I'm gonna look at her.

28:56.220 --> 28:58.180
I'm so sorry.

29:12.170 --> 29:14.600
I always thought
I'd track my dad down,

- Yeah. Seems like

I guess I just wanted
to figure that out for myself.

to Williams to make him think

30:57.770 --> 30:59.770
it was conversion disorder.

Steve. But yeah.

31:23.760 --> 31:26.030
- How did Steve die?
- Objection, relevance.

someone you were close with,
committed suicide,

31:52.160 --> 31:55.030

after that, right?

32:10.380 --> 32:12.210
Objection, misrepresentation
of defense.

32:14.780 --> 32:18.280
He says that conversion disorder
can be treated through therapy.

32:20.420 --> 32:23.590
And he says that
Steve Magnus killing himself

32:23.660 --> 32:25.590
is what started all of this?

32:25.660 --> 32:27.790
- Objection, hearsay.
- It's what he told you?

32:27.860 --> 32:30.930
- Yes.
- Did you believe him?

32:32.670 --> 32:35.640
He showed me how to control
my twitching, so...

32:41.110 --> 32:43.910
You saw toxic barrels
get pulled out of the ground

at the girls' athletic field,
where you play soccer, correct?

32:46.550 --> 32:48.210

- So when did you start

believing that you aren't sick,
that you're delusional?

32:51.620 --> 32:56.160
Delusional? It's an involuntary tremor.
This is real to me.

Williams is right,

what to say in the deposition today?

- Objection!
- What is that supposed to mean?

from my CTS days

33:49.610 --> 33:51.610

When did it occur to you
that the girls in Millwood

37:33.670 --> 37:35.570
were suffering
from conversion disorder?

37:35.640 --> 37:37.740
When I met them
at the hospital.

37:37.810 --> 37:40.440
It was clear they were suffering
a trauma-induced psychosis.

37:40.440 --> 37:43.180
Was it clear when you came to Millwood
or did you have your suspicions before?

37:43.240 --> 37:45.310
I had my suspicions,

37:45.380 --> 37:47.310
but I never make

37:47.380 --> 37:49.380
a diagnosis without knowing
all the evidence.

I don't know.
Just knowing what it is,

39:15.340 --> 39:19.370
and that it has a name
gives me hope.

39:19.440 --> 39:22.540
And I forgot
what that feels like.

39:24.610 --> 39:27.050
Let's just go into this
with eyes open, OK?

39:27.110 --> 39:30.220
I'm not convinced
Williams is on our side.

39:30.220 --> 39:33.890
But he came to Millwood
to be on our side.

39:33.890 --> 39:36.420
What if he had just left town
when you told him to?

39:36.490 --> 39:38.560
Right now, his theory
is the only thing keeping

39:38.630 --> 39:40.960
- the case from moving forward.
- I know,

39:41.030 --> 39:43.500
but the case was about
getting me help, right?

39:45.430 --> 39:47.330
Yeah. Case closed.
