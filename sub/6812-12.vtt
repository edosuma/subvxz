WEBVTT

00:10.920 --> 00:12.717
Can't get a bite
to save my life.

00:13.090 --> 00:14.637
That's 'cause you're
using the wrong lure.

00:14.760 --> 00:16.387
You need
a black tail jib.

00:16.470 --> 00:17.596
That's why you're not
catching anything.

00:17.720 --> 00:19.096
What's your excuse?

00:19.180 --> 00:20.511
Fishing with you.

00:20.600 --> 00:21.919
You're bad luck.
Yeah.

00:23.100 --> 00:24.647
I'm out of here.
All right.

00:25.980 --> 00:27.436
See you tomorrow.
All right.

00:35.740 --> 00:36.946
Hey, honey.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.689
Boys okay?

00:39.950 --> 00:41.906
I'm gonna give it
another 20 minutes.

00:42.000 --> 00:43.490
I don't wanna come
home empty-handed.

00:44.620 --> 00:46.668
All right.
Love you too.

00:53.380 --> 00:55.291
Oh, yeah.
Oh, come on.

00:56.180 --> 00:57.329
You know you want it.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.059
You're in over
your head, cop.

01:20.870 --> 01:24.112
Trust me, you don't
wanna do this.

01:25.250 --> 01:27.206
As a matter of fact,
we do.

01:28.130 --> 01:29.199
Okay.

01:30.040 --> 01:31.291
You asked for it.

01:35.670 --> 01:38.753
Vinnie, you got two tattoos
on your right bicep,

01:38.970 --> 01:41.677
one of your dog, Apahnee,
the other of your daughter,
Chloe.

01:41.760 --> 01:43.387
Cyclops, you got
a dragon on your back

01:43.520 --> 01:46.341
which you recently
augmented with
a naked Khaleesi riding it.

01:46.480 --> 01:48.095
And you, Artie,

01:48.190 --> 01:52.433
you have the date 10/21/93
on your left forearm,

01:52.530 --> 01:55.647
the exact date
you passed the CPA exam.

01:55.740 --> 01:57.901
Oh, speaking of,
did you bring
the authorization

01:58.030 --> 02:00.772
for the extension for
filing your tax return?
Thank you.

02:00.870 --> 02:02.906
Although I'm probably
in a whole new tax bracket,

02:03.040 --> 02:05.907
thanks to the fact that
you guys keep challenging
my perfect memory...

02:06.040 --> 02:07.610
And losing. Pay up.

02:07.710 --> 02:09.246
All right.

02:09.380 --> 02:10.529
Hello?

02:11.840 --> 02:13.125
I'm out in
the middle of nowhere.

02:13.210 --> 02:14.700
It's gonna take me an hour
to get there.

02:14.840 --> 02:16.330
I took Ithe train.

02:17.130 --> 02:19.587
You know what?
I'll be there in 20 minutes.

02:20.510 --> 02:21.545
Put your money away, boys.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.886
I thought of another way
you can pay me.

02:30.810 --> 02:32.562
Thank you, Artie.

02:32.650 --> 02:33.719
Thanks, guys.
BIKER: You got it.

02:33.820 --> 02:34.809
Any time,
babe.

02:34.900 --> 02:37.232
Uh, Carrie,
helmet, please.
Thank you.

02:46.830 --> 02:47.819
CARRIE: Hey.

02:50.540 --> 02:51.825
You okay?

02:52.380 --> 02:53.995
Victim's Shane Barton.

02:54.420 --> 02:56.297
Got a rap sheet,
small stuff,

02:56.420 --> 02:58.468
theft, couple of burglaries.

02:59.930 --> 03:00.999
Shot in the back.

03:01.760 --> 03:03.341
You didn't answer
my question.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.175
I knew him.

03:08.020 --> 03:11.558
Former CI, used to run around
with some bad people.

03:12.150 --> 03:14.471
Shane had turned
his life around.

03:14.610 --> 03:16.726
Married, couple of sons.

03:17.110 --> 03:20.602
I haven't seen him in,
I don't know, six years.

03:21.780 --> 03:22.906
Before I found you again,

03:24.450 --> 03:27.157
Shane helped me
close a few cases.

03:27.290 --> 03:28.689
He was a good guy.

03:28.790 --> 03:31.031
So he was a good guy
with a lot of
bad enemies, right?

03:31.120 --> 03:33.076
That's why he left.

03:33.170 --> 03:34.956
Tired of looking
over his shoulder.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.126
Moved his family to Michigan.

03:41.510 --> 03:42.829
CARRIE: What is
she doing here?

03:44.220 --> 03:45.380
Give me a minute.

03:54.650 --> 03:57.892
I'm here because a former
CI has been killed,

03:57.980 --> 03:58.969
and that's it.

03:59.110 --> 04:00.065
You know
that's not it.

04:00.150 --> 04:01.640
This has Tendler
written all over it.

04:01.740 --> 04:04.152
Shane Barton helped us
with a lot of cases
other than Tendler.

04:04.240 --> 04:05.946
But none you and I...

04:06.030 --> 04:07.986
Al, Tendler is in prison,
all right?

04:08.120 --> 04:10.691
And you need to
seriously consider
the possibility

04:10.830 --> 04:13.572
that Shan_e came back
to continue some
of his bad habits.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.570
You don't believe that.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.451
Russo. Yeah, good.
Thank you.

04:20.340 --> 04:21.876
Shane and his family
have been staying

04:22.010 --> 04:24.672
a few blocks away from here
at his mother-in-law's house.

04:24.760 --> 04:27.001
So, the local
police will go over,
they'll inform her...

04:27.100 --> 04:28.886
No, I need to
tell Laura myself.

04:42.030 --> 04:43.850
Lieutenant Al Burns.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.770
Wow.

04:46.280 --> 04:48.020
Shane is fishing,
but he'll be home...

04:49.740 --> 04:50.786
No.

04:51.750 --> 04:53.900
No. God, no!

05:11.390 --> 05:13.096
We'd been back
for two months.

05:13.230 --> 05:15.266
I told him
to call you,

05:15.390 --> 05:17.051
but he didn't wanna
bother you.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.056
Why'd you guys
come back?

05:20.070 --> 05:22.857
Shane said he
needed to come back.

05:22.940 --> 05:26.194
Said he'd go alone,
but I didn't want him
on his own.

05:26.700 --> 05:27.906
Was he in trouble?

05:28.030 --> 05:29.270
No.

05:29.410 --> 05:33.779
He had been working
for the last year
as a forklift operator.

05:33.950 --> 05:36.202
He wasn't
getting into trouble.

05:36.290 --> 05:39.327
Was there anything
out of the ordinary
the last couple of weeks?

05:40.420 --> 05:42.411
As a matter of fact, yeah.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.261
Who took these, Laura?

05:56.390 --> 05:59.188
They were on the table
when I came home from work.

06:00.190 --> 06:02.977
I showed them to Shane,
and he got a look,

06:04.070 --> 06:06.777
worried
and then mad.

06:07.400 --> 06:09.152
And I asked him
what was going on,

06:09.280 --> 06:11.441
and he told me
not to worry,

06:12.200 --> 06:13.280
and then he
ran out the door.

06:15.290 --> 06:17.030
He said it was fine.

06:19.500 --> 06:21.070
Laura,

06:21.920 --> 06:25.083
if there's anything I can do
for you, for the boys...

06:36.810 --> 06:37.799
You look like hell.

06:39.810 --> 06:41.687
I just came from
Shane's wife and kids.

06:42.400 --> 06:43.469
I'm going back later.

06:43.610 --> 06:45.851
I'm having a radio car
sit on the house for now,

06:45.980 --> 06:47.686
and I may have something.

06:48.200 --> 06:50.065
These were taken
outside of Shane's house

06:50.160 --> 06:52.276
and left inside.

06:52.370 --> 06:55.612
So, whoever killed him
was following him first.

06:55.700 --> 06:57.827
So, by leaving these,
som_e asshole was
letting him know

06:57.910 --> 06:59.320
that he could
get to his family.

06:59.410 --> 07:00.957
Yeah, they were
trying to scare him,

07:01.670 --> 07:04.207
and when they couldn't,
they killed him.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.046
I saw you talking to Sandra.

07:06.420 --> 07:08.502
Al, I know
something's going on.

07:08.590 --> 07:09.966
I can't.

07:10.050 --> 07:11.631
We don't keep secrets
from each other.

07:11.720 --> 07:13.506
Well, let's see, Car.

07:13.640 --> 07:14.800
There's the fact
that you got married

07:14.890 --> 07:16.460
and didn't tell me
about that, so.

07:16.560 --> 07:17.845
I'm serious.

07:17.930 --> 07:19.932
Give me a bit more time.

07:20.020 --> 07:23.262
Just trust me for now.

07:29.700 --> 07:30.769
You talk to Al?
Oh, yeah.

07:30.860 --> 07:31.986
He's getting Shane
Barton's widow

07:32.070 --> 07:33.526
_ and her_ two kids
In protective custody.

07:33.620 --> 07:34.609
How'd he sound?

07:34.910 --> 07:36.787
Ah, we gotta get
whoever did this.

07:36.870 --> 07:38.076
I'm with you, partner.

07:39.710 --> 07:43.999
And to that end,
let me introduce you
to this gem, Sammy Gavlak.

07:44.080 --> 07:45.832
Low-level hood,
independent contractor,

07:45.920 --> 07:48.548
but he runs with
some rough people.

07:48.630 --> 07:50.040
Yeah, I recognize
some of these faces.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.172
So, I just got off the phone
with Staten Island DA.

07:52.260 --> 07:54.967
Turns out,
Gavlak's being brought up
on RICO charges

07:55.050 --> 07:56.677
that could put
him away for life.

07:56.760 --> 07:58.011
Trial starts next week.

07:58.390 --> 08:01.268
Let me guess,
Shane Barton was gonna
testify against him.

08:01.390 --> 08:02.379
Bingo.

08:02.520 --> 08:04.226
That sounds like
motive for murder.

08:04.310 --> 08:06.437
All right, look,
we'll see if we got
a 20 on this guy.

08:06.570 --> 08:08.060
I'll call Al,
see if he can
check out Gavlak.

08:08.570 --> 08:09.559
All right.

08:10.400 --> 08:12.106
WOMAN: Yeah! God!

08:12.240 --> 08:14.401
MAN: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:18.160 --> 08:19.115
Let's give the guy
a minute.

08:19.240 --> 08:21.071
No. No, we don't
have a minute.

08:24.080 --> 08:25.536
Ready?
You're first.

08:27.170 --> 08:28.330
Go.

08:29.670 --> 08:30.625
WOMAN: Hey!

08:30.760 --> 08:31.909
Freeze! Police.

08:32.010 --> 08:33.420
Hey, what the hell
are you doing?

08:33.510 --> 08:34.499
Where the hell is he?

08:34.590 --> 08:35.579
Where's who?
VVho?

08:35.680 --> 08:36.669
The guy you're in here with,
that's who.

08:36.760 --> 08:37.840
WOMAN: There's
no one here.

08:37.930 --> 08:38.965
We could hear you
in the hall.

08:39.100 --> 08:40.306
We could hear you
down the street.

08:41.270 --> 08:42.510
I'm just relaxing.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.339
Who's gonna fix my door?
Hmm?

08:45.850 --> 08:47.351
You can't go in there.

08:48.650 --> 08:49.776
Hey.
Okay.

08:49.860 --> 08:50.929
Okay, you got me.

08:51.030 --> 08:53.021
Sammy Gavlak?
Yeah, in the flesh.

08:53.110 --> 08:55.852
You're under arrest
for the murder
of Shane Barton.

08:55.950 --> 08:57.110
I love you.

08:57.240 --> 08:58.275
I love you too,
pumpkin pie.

08:58.410 --> 08:59.786
All right, come on,
you two.

09:04.460 --> 09:06.576
You know, Sammy,
until we barged in,

09:06.670 --> 09:08.160
you were having
a pretty good week.

09:08.840 --> 09:12.162
I mean, you get to bang
a beautiful _woman
like Monique,

09:12.300 --> 09:15.463
and the main witness against
you conveniently dies.

09:15.970 --> 09:17.460
I didn't kill the guy,

09:17.590 --> 09:19.000
but if you find out who did,
do me a favor,

09:19.140 --> 09:20.960
send him a fruit
basket from me.

09:21.180 --> 09:22.306
Yeah.

09:22.430 --> 09:24.307
Your_ RICO trial
swung In your favor

09:24.430 --> 09:26.307
with Shane gone,
I'll give you that.

09:28.480 --> 09:29.970
But our forensics people

09:30.070 --> 09:33.688
tracked the photos
of Shane's boys to you.

09:34.820 --> 09:36.811
You just replaced
a RICO trial

09:36.910 --> 09:39.231
with a murder rap,
dumbass.

09:40.410 --> 09:42.787
Uniforms will be in
to book you in a minute.

09:42.870 --> 09:45.498
Whoa, wait.
Okay.

09:47.620 --> 09:49.326
I took the pictures.

09:49.420 --> 09:50.705
I dropped them off,

09:50.840 --> 09:52.159
just sending
a friendly message

09:52.250 --> 09:54.161
to stay away,
butthatsit

09:54.300 --> 09:55.836
And you say the guy
got shot this morning?

09:55.920 --> 09:56.921
I was with a friend.

09:57.010 --> 09:57.999
Monique?

09:58.090 --> 09:59.216
Someone else.

09:59.340 --> 10:00.591
Now, don't tell Monique.
She'll kill me.

10:00.680 --> 10:02.170
Name and number, Romeo.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.972
Hey, listen,
did you see anything

10:06.060 --> 10:08.016
suspicious when
you were at Shane's?

10:08.100 --> 10:11.354
There was this
jacked-up SUV.

10:11.480 --> 10:13.027
It was green,
parked a couple doors up.

10:13.150 --> 10:14.276
See anybody inside?

10:14.360 --> 10:16.180
Nah, the windows were tinted,

10:16.320 --> 10:19.403
but it had these, like,
floodlights on the top.

10:19.820 --> 10:20.775
That help?

10:23.330 --> 10:24.740
And...

10:25.330 --> 10:28.163
You're under arrest
for Witness Intimidation,
for now.

10:28.290 --> 10:30.497
Murder is still
on the table.

10:31.380 --> 10:32.916
And my guess,

10:33.050 --> 10:34.540
Monique is gonna be pissed

10:34.630 --> 10:36.712
when she finds out
about Ariana.

10:57.240 --> 10:58.525
You wanted to see me?

10:58.900 --> 11:03.155
Yeah, so Sammy Gavlak's
alibi panned out,

11:03.910 --> 11:06.617
and I have some
news about Tendler.

11:08.120 --> 11:09.576
He was released last week.

11:09.920 --> 11:10.864
What the hell?
I know.

11:10.960 --> 11:12.279
The parole board was
supposed to let me know.

11:12.420 --> 11:14.991
They contacted my old office.
I just now found out.

11:15.090 --> 11:16.125
I'm gonna talk to him now.

11:16.250 --> 11:17.205
No, no, no, I checked.

11:17.300 --> 11:19.086
Tendler's living
in an apartment
in Ossining.

11:19.170 --> 11:21.001
He's on electronic
home superw5ion.

11:21.090 --> 11:22.830
Come on, the guy still
has friends on the force.

11:22.930 --> 11:24.670
It would take one phone call
to disable that thing.

11:24.760 --> 11:26.091
Just stop. Stop it.

11:26.220 --> 11:28.848
I'm not happy that Tendler
got out either, all right?

11:28.930 --> 11:31.478
If the truth comes out,
we both have a lot to lose.

11:31.600 --> 11:32.931
You've got more to lose.

11:34.980 --> 11:37.471
So you wanna talk about it?
Let's talk about it.

11:38.490 --> 11:40.606
Yup, I'm the one
who planted the coke

11:40.700 --> 11:42.099
in Tendler's car,
and you are...

11:42.240 --> 11:44.561
I'm not trying
to whitewash what I did.

11:45.620 --> 11:48.077
It doesn't matter.
Tendler was out of control.

11:48.450 --> 11:51.032
You know, the witness
who saw him taking that
payoff wound up dead.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.781
We couldn't prove it
the right way then.

11:52.870 --> 11:54.280
Let me prove it
this time.

11:55.460 --> 11:56.745
Hey, guys.
I think we got something.

11:57.670 --> 12:00.082
Sorry, you want me
to come back later, Boss?

12:01.260 --> 12:04.673
No. Lieutenant Burns and I,
we're done.

12:06.220 --> 12:07.676
Okay, we got some
surveillance footage coming in

12:07.810 --> 12:10.051
from an ATM two
blocks from where
Shane Barton was murdered.

12:10.140 --> 12:12.802
SUV matches the description
that Sammy Gavlak gave us.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.339
I think we're about to see
who killed Shane.

12:24.450 --> 12:25.986
All right.
WOMAN: Sandra,
these came for you.

12:26.070 --> 12:27.116
Okay.

12:27.200 --> 12:29.282
JAY LEE: All right,
looks like we're
almost there.

12:31.870 --> 12:33.110
Showtime.

12:33.210 --> 12:35.496
You're right.
That's the same car
Sammy described.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.796
I don't think I got enough
for facial recognition,

12:41.880 --> 12:44.371
so does he look
familiar to anybody?

12:45.470 --> 12:46.505
Nope.
Hey.

12:47.180 --> 12:49.751
I got ballistics
on the bullet
that killed Shane.

12:49.850 --> 12:51.841
Apparently, it's linked
to six unsolved murders

12:51.930 --> 12:52.919
right here in the city.

12:53.020 --> 12:55.682
Talked to my guys
at Organized Crime.
They're thinking hitman.

12:56.900 --> 12:57.889
He operates in the darknet,

12:58.020 --> 12:59.317
that little nasty side
of the Internet where all...

12:59.400 --> 13:00.606
We know what
the darknet is, Denny.

13:00.690 --> 13:01.736
Go, go, go.

13:01.860 --> 13:04.738
Okay, right,
so his handle is E22517.

13:04.860 --> 13:06.737
All right,
I'll start running that,
see what I...

13:06.870 --> 13:08.440
I know what it means.

13:08.530 --> 13:10.532
Ezekiel, chapter 25 verse 17.

13:11.450 --> 13:13.031
Chapter 25, verse 17.

13:13.120 --> 13:16.874
"I will carry
out great vengeance
and punish them in my wrath."

13:16.960 --> 13:18.666
Didn't know you were
a biblical scholar.

13:18.750 --> 13:20.490
More of a Tarantino scholar.

13:20.590 --> 13:22.956
The scene where Sam Jackson
gives the speech

13:23.050 --> 13:25.086
right before he blows
Frank Whaley away
from Pulp Fiction.

13:25.220 --> 13:27.006
All right,
so how do we
find this Ezekiel?

13:27.090 --> 13:29.672
We don't. It was smart
that you looped in
Organized Crime.

13:29.760 --> 13:30.715
If it's a hitman,

13:30.850 --> 13:32.135
we should let them
run with the case.

13:32.220 --> 13:33.471
This is our case, Sandra.

13:33.560 --> 13:34.720
Yeah, but it's my call.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.891
My office now, please.

13:40.610 --> 13:41.599
Oh.

13:41.730 --> 13:42.936
What are you thinking?

13:43.240 --> 13:45.856
Grab your computer.
Meet me at the bar.

13:49.990 --> 13:53.118
The only way to catch
someone like Ezekiel
is to hire him.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.747
Where are we going
with this, Carrie?

13:55.870 --> 13:58.373
Oh, Jay, I have
a horrible husband.

13:58.830 --> 14:00.036
He's so mean to me.

14:00.130 --> 14:01.836
He's abusive,
but he's very, very rich,

14:01.920 --> 14:03.581
and I want to
inherit his money.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.371
I want him dead.

14:05.470 --> 14:07.756
But you just can't reach out
to a hitman, Carrie.

14:07.840 --> 14:09.296
He's gonna reach out to me.

14:09.430 --> 14:11.000
All you gotta do is get me
onto one of those forums

14:11.100 --> 14:13.000
where people
talk about wanting
to murder their spouses.

14:13.100 --> 14:14.670
So that means
we're gonna hit
the darknet again.

14:14.770 --> 14:15.976
Do it, come on.

14:18.440 --> 14:21.102
Holy smokes, I can't believe
there's that many people.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.180
All right, so what's
your name gonna be?

14:23.400 --> 14:24.389
Uh...

14:24.990 --> 14:26.890
Beatrix.
Beatrix.

14:26.990 --> 14:29.106
Write in that I
hate my husband

14:29.240 --> 14:31.276
and that I'm writing
out of desperation,

14:31.490 --> 14:34.288
and that money
is no object

14:34.370 --> 14:36.110
and write in that
I live in Manhattan.

14:36.200 --> 14:37.747
Say that he's abusive,
and then put in some

14:37.830 --> 14:40.458
Tarantino reference from
Kill Bill 2, The Bride.

14:40.580 --> 14:41.660
Oh, that's good.
Like a revenge thing, right?

14:41.790 --> 14:43.371
Yeah, yeah, that's good.

14:43.920 --> 14:45.205
Okay.
All right.

14:51.760 --> 14:54.638
Al, this is
Detective Shanna Coates.

14:54.810 --> 14:57.472
Internal Affairs.
That didn't take long.

14:57.810 --> 14:59.266
Is it that obvious?

14:59.980 --> 15:02.016
I'm just here because
of Barton's former connection

15:02.150 --> 15:04.812
to the NYPD
as a confidential informant.

15:04.900 --> 15:06.811
He was_ connected _
to prosecutions in the City,

15:06.900 --> 15:08.731
so we're just looking
into every angle.

15:09.450 --> 15:11.099
Not trying to jam anybody up.

15:11.660 --> 15:13.025
Let me translate.

15:13.160 --> 15:14.366
She's here to jam someone up.

15:14.490 --> 15:17.869
Captain Russo
said I could expect
everyone's full cooperation.

15:18.540 --> 15:20.496
Tell your team
I'll be speaking
with them individually.

15:22.330 --> 15:23.661
Right this way.

15:28.970 --> 15:30.289
Oh, here we go.

15:30.720 --> 15:31.789
CARRIE: All right,
look at that.

15:32.010 --> 15:33.716
He made a Tarantino reference.

15:33.850 --> 15:34.965
He'd have said Django.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.766
Do I know my hitmen or what?

15:37.220 --> 15:39.268
All right, look at this.
He wants to meet. 1:00 pm.

15:39.350 --> 15:41.306
"Bring $10,000
to discuss further."

15:41.390 --> 15:44.439
Ms. Beatrix, you have just
made a date with a hitman.

16:00.370 --> 16:01.359
You her?

16:01.960 --> 16:03.166
How do we do this?

16:03.250 --> 16:04.456
We don't do anything.

16:04.960 --> 16:07.372
If I decide to do this,
I'm gonna need
another 90 grand.

16:07.550 --> 16:08.585
Ninety?

16:09.380 --> 16:10.460
I love Earl.

16:10.550 --> 16:13.508
It's just the cheating and
the lying and the abuse.

16:13.590 --> 16:14.716
I mean, what am I
supposed to do?

16:17.220 --> 16:18.926
That's up to you.
Just give me the money and...

16:19.060 --> 16:21.551
Wait a second.
How do I know you're
not just gonna take my money

16:21.640 --> 16:23.471
and I'll never
see you again?

16:23.560 --> 16:27.348
I guarantee you,
you don't give it to me,
you definitely won't.

16:27.440 --> 16:28.520
Wow, you're good at this.

16:29.190 --> 16:30.487
Kind of reminds me of,
um, you know,

16:30.570 --> 16:33.277
the negotiation between
Bridget and Colonel Landa.

16:34.490 --> 16:38.199
You know, Colonel Landa from
Inglourious Basterds.

16:39.240 --> 16:40.241
No?

16:40.910 --> 16:43.287
Guess you're not
a Tarantino fan, huh?

16:48.750 --> 16:50.377
Victim's Shane Barton.

16:50.460 --> 16:52.371
Got a rap sheet,
small stuff.

17:03.060 --> 17:04.516
CARRIE: Jay, Denny,
let that guy go.

17:04.600 --> 17:06.147
I got eyes
on the target.

17:10.570 --> 17:11.855
Nice to meet you, Ezekiel.

17:11.940 --> 17:14.022
Get your hands up.
You're under arrest.

17:18.240 --> 17:19.776
Is this from
Ezekiel's apartment?

17:19.870 --> 17:21.326
AKA Gibson Rowan.

17:22.450 --> 17:23.860
Toss me that bag
for a second.

17:24.410 --> 17:25.741
Yup.

17:26.120 --> 17:27.781
Looks like we're
almost there.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.995
WOMAN: Sandra,
these came for you.

17:34.550 --> 17:35.585
You okay?

17:35.680 --> 17:36.624
No.

17:36.760 --> 17:38.500
But I will be.

17:39.600 --> 17:40.919
All right.

17:45.440 --> 17:48.512
Al, Falls and McGuinness, CPA.

17:49.150 --> 17:50.970
Russo had papers
from the same firm.

17:51.110 --> 17:55.149
Last time I checked,
hitmen don't generally
report their income.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.813
Which raises the question,
what was it doing in
Rowan's apartment?

17:58.950 --> 18:00.190
You need to talk to me.

18:00.330 --> 18:02.480
I want to_ know
what's gomg on.

18:02.620 --> 18:03.655
We're partners.

18:04.500 --> 18:05.489
Not here.

18:06.410 --> 18:07.490
Buy me a drink.

18:08.790 --> 18:09.950
AL: Clay Tendler.

18:11.170 --> 18:13.331
He was a detective
when I was at the 117.

18:13.460 --> 18:15.508
Russo was the
commanding officer.

18:15.630 --> 18:16.836
His too.

18:17.260 --> 18:18.670
The guy was dirty.

18:18.800 --> 18:21.007
He was on the payroll
of more than one bad guy,

18:21.100 --> 18:22.556
but I couldn't prove it.

18:23.720 --> 18:25.472
One day, a civilian
reported seeing

18:25.560 --> 18:28.472
Tendler taking a payoff
from a drug dealer.

18:28.560 --> 18:30.892
Two nights later, the guy dies
when his apartment burns down.

18:31.020 --> 18:33.477
Russo decided that's it.

18:35.190 --> 18:36.987
I had just made a coke bust.

18:38.070 --> 18:39.810
She took a kilo from that,

18:39.910 --> 18:42.526
put it in the trunk of
Tendler's civilian car,

18:42.620 --> 18:44.281
and called a spot inspection

18:44.370 --> 18:46.076
of the employee parking lot.

18:47.540 --> 18:49.576
So Tendler went away,
all right,

18:49.710 --> 18:51.701
for possession with
intent to distribute,

18:52.710 --> 18:56.043
until he was
released on parole.

18:56.590 --> 18:59.798
What does all of
this have to do with
Shane Barton's murder?

18:59.880 --> 19:01.962
I talked to the DA
who confirmed that

19:03.010 --> 19:05.843
Shane had come
back to come clean

19:05.930 --> 19:07.010
about everything he knew.

19:07.100 --> 19:08.977
Maybe, he knew about Russo

19:09.060 --> 19:10.095
framing Tendler.

19:10.230 --> 19:12.016
He was gonna give
sealed testimony

19:12.110 --> 19:13.850
in front of a closed
grand jury.

19:13.940 --> 19:15.931
You think Sandra Russo,

19:16.070 --> 19:20.029
a decorated police officer,
our captain,

19:20.110 --> 19:23.864
murdered Shane Barton
to cover a lie that she told?

19:23.950 --> 19:26.282
This is...
That's a lot to swallow, Al.

19:26.410 --> 19:27.866
We have to follow
the evidence,

19:27.950 --> 19:29.906
and the evidence right now

19:30.000 --> 19:32.286
points to her as
the prime suspect.

19:37.550 --> 19:38.869
I can tell you've
got something.

19:38.970 --> 19:40.085
JAY LEE: Yeah.

19:41.180 --> 19:42.750
You are not
gonna believe this.

19:42.840 --> 19:43.841
Uh...

19:44.600 --> 19:47.637
Look, now, I spent the
whole day on Gibson
Rowan's computer.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.726
He definitely did
Barton's murder.

19:49.810 --> 19:51.687
Were you able to find out
who paid him to do it?

19:53.770 --> 19:55.101
Boss, it was Russo.

19:56.440 --> 19:59.432
The whole conversation was
sent from her home computer.

19:59.690 --> 20:01.487
Are you absolutely positive?

20:02.860 --> 20:04.487
I checked it three times.

20:09.790 --> 20:11.610
Thanks.
Yeah.

20:17.960 --> 20:19.450
I was just checking
with Organized Crime

20:19.590 --> 20:21.626
to see where they are
with their Barton case.

20:21.720 --> 20:23.119
Actually, we've made
a break in that case.

20:25.930 --> 20:27.136
I thought I was very clear...

20:27.220 --> 20:28.380
I followed a lead.

20:29.180 --> 20:31.637
We think
we've got the person
who hired Ezekiel.

20:32.060 --> 20:34.267
Great. You plan on telling me
who that is?

20:34.650 --> 20:36.049
Sandra Russo,

20:37.320 --> 20:39.777
you're under arrest for
the murder of Shane Barton.

21:22.650 --> 21:24.277
I'm telling you,
there's no way she did it.

21:24.360 --> 21:26.271
Sandra is
a lot of things.

21:26.360 --> 21:27.611
She's not a criminal.

21:27.700 --> 21:29.156
I mean, you gotta admit
the evidence here

21:29.240 --> 21:30.696
does not look good for her.

21:30.830 --> 21:32.866
Okay, I got some news.

21:33.410 --> 21:34.365
You're not gonna like it.

21:34.500 --> 21:36.912
They found a letter
jammed in the back
of Russo's closet.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.951
I just sent it
to your computer
from the evidence room.

21:42.920 --> 21:45.297
Oh, I... I'm sorry
about the quality.

21:45.380 --> 21:47.257
I guess I must have
rushed when I scanned
it or something.

21:47.390 --> 21:48.880
Somebody was
blackmailing Russo.

21:49.010 --> 21:50.887
Yeah, that somebody
was Shane Barton.

21:53.270 --> 21:54.589
All right,
everyone, listen up.

21:55.980 --> 21:59.017
I appreciate what a shock
Captain Russo's arrest

21:59.110 --> 22:00.225
must be for all of you.

22:01.190 --> 22:02.179
Oh, man.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.487
In case it's not clear,
from this moment on,

22:04.570 --> 22:06.731
none of you are working
the Barton murder,

22:06.860 --> 22:10.114
including having any contact
with Captain Russo.

22:10.240 --> 22:11.730
_ I'll also be
needing your statements

22:11.830 --> 22:13.286
regarding Captain
Russo's behavior,

22:13.410 --> 22:14.946
both present and past.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.070
Please pass it along
to Lieutenant Burns

22:17.170 --> 22:18.455
when he gets back
from Booking.

22:18.580 --> 22:21.333
I'm gonna make
it easy for you.
Mine's short and sweet.

22:21.420 --> 22:23.456
There's no way
she did this.

22:24.090 --> 22:26.502
So, yeah,
I think I'm done.

22:26.590 --> 22:28.251
No, Detective Padilla,
you're not.

22:28.340 --> 22:30.001
Needless to say,
you're not to discuss

22:30.090 --> 22:32.172
your proposed testimony
amongst yourselves,

22:32.260 --> 22:35.058
and you're not to go
see Russo in Rikers.

22:35.140 --> 22:36.266
Am I clear?

22:36.390 --> 22:37.971
Why do you even
need our statements?

22:38.100 --> 22:39.556
It seems like you've already
made up your mind.

22:39.900 --> 22:41.936
Detective Wells.

22:42.020 --> 22:43.396
We haven't had the pleasure,

22:43.480 --> 22:45.311
but your reputation
precedes you.

22:45.440 --> 22:49.274
I'm well aware
of your history of
disobeying orders.

22:49.410 --> 22:52.573
Trust me, you don't wanna
disobey mine.

22:58.620 --> 23:00.872
REPORTER 1: There he is.
REPORTER 2: Excuse me.

23:01.080 --> 23:03.708
Clay, do you feel vindicated
now that they let you out?

23:03.840 --> 23:05.705
I've always
maintained my innocence,

23:05.800 --> 23:08.212
and the unfortunate arrest of

23:08.300 --> 23:10.882
Captain Sandra Russo
only bolsters that.

23:10.970 --> 23:12.460
I just met
with the Police Commission,

23:12.600 --> 23:16.172
and I assured them
that I will cooperate
in any way I can

23:16.310 --> 23:17.470
with the investigation.

23:17.640 --> 23:22.395
I spent years in prison
for something that I didn't...

23:24.690 --> 23:27.147
I used to hear stories about
guys released from prison

23:27.240 --> 23:29.731
after 20 years for something
that they didn't do,

23:29.820 --> 23:31.697
and to be honest,
I didn't care.

23:31.820 --> 23:35.324
I figured they
had to do something
to get there,

23:36.870 --> 23:38.155
but I was wrong.

23:38.290 --> 23:40.155
So in addition to trying
to clear my name,

23:40.250 --> 23:42.821
I'm going to look at other
questionable convictions

23:42.960 --> 23:44.530
and bring
a cop's perspective

23:44.670 --> 23:47.662
to cases where injustice
may have been done.

23:47.800 --> 23:49.461
I'm also going to...

23:54.300 --> 23:56.848
I'm also going to
reach out to anyone

23:56.970 --> 24:00.349
who I may have wronged
over the years.

24:01.520 --> 24:03.226
Try to make things right.

24:05.060 --> 24:06.436
Anyhow, thanks for coming.

24:06.520 --> 24:07.726
God bless you.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.155
Lieutenant Burns,
have a seat.

24:20.830 --> 24:22.536
I see you've made
yourself at home.

24:23.370 --> 24:24.530
You're looking at Jay?

24:25.080 --> 24:26.411
He's a Boy Scout.

24:27.250 --> 24:29.878
I'm just trying to
familiarize myself
with the unit.

24:30.010 --> 24:31.329
We're focused on Russo.

24:31.420 --> 24:33.888
I've been hearing that she
has a history of corruption,

24:33.970 --> 24:36.928
and, as you know, 1PP
has a zero-tolerance policy

24:37.050 --> 24:38.301
when it comes to corruption.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.425
Maybe they should
investigate themselves.

24:41.390 --> 24:43.381
We've gotten off
on the wrong foot.

24:44.690 --> 24:47.227
Major Crimes is gonna need
a new captain.

24:47.860 --> 24:50.738
I can't think of anyone
better suited for
the job than you.

24:50.860 --> 24:52.771
You're offering me
Russo's job?

24:52.900 --> 24:54.106
Unofficially,

24:54.240 --> 24:56.310
but once the dust settles
on the Barton murder,

24:56.410 --> 24:57.729
job's yours.

24:57.870 --> 24:59.735
As long as I help you
put her away.

24:59.830 --> 25:02.537
As long as you cooperate
with the investigation.

25:08.630 --> 25:12.339
The original evidence report
on the coke I seized
in the bust.

25:12.420 --> 25:16.629
After I gave Russo the kilo
to frame Tendler,

25:16.760 --> 25:18.250
I filed another report.

25:18.390 --> 25:19.755
Why?

25:19.890 --> 25:22.768
Because he was a bad guy.
Because I was stupid.

25:22.850 --> 25:25.432
Your commanding officer
told you to turn over
some drugs

25:25.520 --> 25:27.226
that you had seized.
That's it.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.351
Is this the only copy
of the evidence report?

25:30.440 --> 25:33.489
Yeah, I voided it
before it got in the system.

25:33.610 --> 25:34.645
TENDLER: Hey, look there.

25:36.740 --> 25:37.866
Son of a bitch.

25:37.950 --> 25:39.190
Al, let me handle this.

25:39.280 --> 25:41.077
No way.
No, you look at me.

25:41.160 --> 25:43.651
If you start something,
we're not gonna get
Sandra out ofjail.

25:43.790 --> 25:45.826
Now, let me handle this.

25:46.290 --> 25:47.666
Yeah.

25:47.790 --> 25:48.916
Welcome.

25:55.470 --> 25:57.461
Hey, how you doing?
Carrie Wells.

25:57.550 --> 25:59.632
I know who you are.

25:59.760 --> 26:02.467
A! Burns' partner,
that frealq memory lady.

26:02.600 --> 26:03.589
Oh.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.136
You should watch
the company you keep.

26:05.230 --> 26:07.266
You should watch
the bars you go into.

26:07.350 --> 26:10.183
This is a cop bar,
and you're not a cop.

26:11.150 --> 26:13.721
Not yet,
but once my record's cleared,

26:13.820 --> 26:16.607
I'm putting in my papers
for reinstatement.

26:16.700 --> 26:20.022
Who knows,
in a different universe,
you and I...

26:20.160 --> 26:22.902
In a different universe,
I'd still be looking to
put your ass away.

26:22.990 --> 26:24.196
So here's the thing,

26:24.330 --> 26:26.491
this little game
that you've been playing,

26:26.620 --> 26:27.609
cat and mouse.

26:28.790 --> 26:30.030
I'm the cat.

26:31.000 --> 26:33.377
Wow, it's a good thing
I'm sitting down right now.

26:33.500 --> 26:35.161
That speech got me
a little rewed up.

26:35.300 --> 26:37.040
Well, I'm glad
I caught your attention.

26:38.180 --> 26:39.829
You keep thinking
that you're the cat

26:39.970 --> 26:42.552
when you go home tonight
to your building

26:42.680 --> 26:46.514
at 714 West 20th Street,
apartment 2-A.

26:46.770 --> 26:48.055
You know where I live.

26:48.190 --> 26:50.260
I know what you wear
to bed, or don't.

26:50.350 --> 26:51.681
The next time
you're in the neighborhood,

26:51.810 --> 26:53.186
you should, uh, stop by.

26:53.320 --> 26:55.470
And get arrested
for breaking and entering?

26:56.360 --> 26:59.193
Nice try, Detective,
but I've already
been set up once.

26:59.820 --> 27:01.026
But maybe I'll see you again.

27:01.280 --> 27:03.020
You can count on it.

27:05.290 --> 27:07.246
AL: He knows where you live?
He followed you home.

27:07.370 --> 27:08.906
I'm fine.
For now.

27:09.040 --> 27:10.701
I'm not giving him
the chance to hurt you.

27:10.830 --> 27:12.286
I can take care of myself, Al.
I know you can,

27:12.380 --> 27:13.950
but he's not_
gonna stop until...

27:14.050 --> 27:16.416
Until what?
Until you shoot him?
Until you kill him?

27:18.670 --> 27:20.171
You need to get a grip.

27:20.260 --> 27:22.592
She's gonna be in
here any second,
and then you're done.

27:24.890 --> 27:25.879
All right.

27:26.020 --> 27:29.558
Look, Coates is gonna
play this by the book.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.596
She's got her suspect.

27:31.730 --> 27:34.563
She's not giving us a warrant
to search Tendler's place,

27:34.650 --> 27:36.470
and forget about
bringing him in here
for questioning.

27:36.570 --> 27:38.185
You know,
that temper of yours

27:38.280 --> 27:39.895
is gonna get you into
a lot of trouble.

27:41.570 --> 27:43.811
Let's take another walk
outside, okay?

27:45.620 --> 27:48.828
No, I was thinking
about the car, but just...

27:48.910 --> 27:51.322
Al, hey, you want a drink?
Sit down.

27:51.420 --> 27:52.409
Where's your partner?

27:52.500 --> 27:55.492
I know you have her doing
your talking for you
right now, so...

27:57.920 --> 27:59.410
Next time you wanna mess
with someone,

28:01.470 --> 28:02.630
you mess with me.

28:04.430 --> 28:05.886
Oh, I hope
that was worth it, burns,

28:07.520 --> 28:10.262
'cause I gotta figure,
you just made me
2 million bucks.

28:10.350 --> 28:11.760
When you're done hiding
behind your lawyers

28:11.890 --> 28:15.144
and your scumbag friends,
you know where to find me.

28:15.270 --> 28:17.602
You're always a lot of fun
at a party, Al.

28:24.160 --> 28:25.730
JAY LEE:
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:25.830 --> 28:27.946
Al, I don't know if you wanna
be around here right now.

28:28.040 --> 28:29.439
Hey, listen Boss,

28:29.540 --> 28:31.110
Coates heard
you punched Tendler.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.279
And I'm saying
she's a little bit...

28:32.410 --> 28:35.208
I'm perfectly capable of
expressing myself, Detective.

28:36.130 --> 28:37.279
Let's take this
in my office.

28:37.420 --> 28:39.206
That's not your office.

28:40.760 --> 28:41.795
And right here is good.

28:42.550 --> 28:45.678
I'm gonna take your behavior
as a "No" to my earlier offer.

28:45.800 --> 28:47.427
I'm not gonna help you
take down Russo,

28:47.510 --> 28:49.307
so yeah, it's a "No."

28:49.470 --> 28:51.097
I know you think
it was Tendler,

28:51.180 --> 28:52.977
who you just punched,
unprovoked,

28:53.100 --> 28:54.681
in front of
a dozen Witnesses.

28:55.230 --> 28:56.390
You're suspended,
three days.

28:56.480 --> 28:57.640
I'll raise you.

29:00.030 --> 29:00.985
I quit.

29:01.110 --> 29:02.486
Al, what are you doing?

29:03.530 --> 29:04.906
Accepted. Your gun.

29:05.700 --> 29:06.860
Hey, come on now...

29:06.990 --> 29:08.446
Stay out of this,
both of you.

29:08.530 --> 29:10.998
And you,
go screw yourself.

29:30.930 --> 29:31.919
Hey.

29:33.520 --> 29:35.385
DENNY: I'm sorry, Boss.
I hate seeing you like this.

29:35.520 --> 29:38.182
Come on, I'm fine.
Do you guys miss me?

29:38.730 --> 29:40.436
By the way,
someone please tell Al

29:40.520 --> 29:41.851
he's gonna end up
in here with me

29:41.940 --> 29:43.237
unless he cuts
this shit out.

29:43.360 --> 29:44.896
We're gonna get
you outta here.
Really?

29:45.030 --> 29:48.443
You got, like, a pick?
Got a file in a cake?

29:50.330 --> 29:51.536
I didn't do it.

29:51.660 --> 29:52.786
We never thought that.

29:52.870 --> 29:53.905
Never doubted it.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.702
Well, you're
either really good liars
or really bad cops

29:56.790 --> 29:59.031
'cause someone did
a great job of setting me up.

29:59.710 --> 30:01.086
Give us something, Boss.

30:02.050 --> 30:04.166
Anything that can help us
take down Tendler.

30:04.260 --> 30:05.830
He kept everything.

30:05.930 --> 30:07.215
If he got a gun off you,

30:07.340 --> 30:09.752
drugs, jewelry,
he held on to it.

30:09.890 --> 30:11.050
DENNY: A pack rat?

30:11.430 --> 30:12.806
That's pretty stupid
for a crooked cop.

30:12.890 --> 30:14.972
No. He holds on to everything,
so he has leverage

30:15.060 --> 30:17.096
to set up anybody
who gets in his way.

30:17.230 --> 30:18.891
Means he's probably
still got it somewhere, right?

30:19.020 --> 30:21.261
I heard just
north of the city.

30:21.520 --> 30:22.771
Where north?

30:23.730 --> 30:25.061
That's all I got.

30:25.150 --> 30:26.390
JAY LEE: Okay,
that's a start.

30:26.490 --> 30:29.232
We find that stash,
we might be able
to find something

30:29.320 --> 30:30.901
that links him
to Shane Barton's murder,

30:31.030 --> 30:32.657
and we get you outta here.

30:33.830 --> 30:34.819
Simple.

30:40.580 --> 30:41.740
a; 1;;
13?: frgv:
_§' 7 :

30:41.840 --> 30:43.239
You find anything
on where Tendler

30:43.340 --> 30:44.625
stashed all
the stuff he's taken?

30:44.760 --> 30:45.749
Not much yet.

30:45.880 --> 30:48.212
I mean, he's been
living in an apartment
since he got out of jail.

30:48.300 --> 30:49.426
Small, nothing fancy.

30:49.550 --> 30:51.290
It's south of
Peekskill in Ossining.

30:51.760 --> 30:52.920
Peekskill?

30:53.060 --> 30:54.175
But once my record's cleared,

30:54.270 --> 30:56.056
I'm putting in my papers
for reinstatement.

31:00.270 --> 31:03.433
Tendler had a matchbook
from a bar in Peekskill.

31:03.570 --> 31:05.106
It was full,
so he was there recently.

31:05.190 --> 31:06.179
Look sharp.

31:06.280 --> 31:07.349
Okay.

31:08.320 --> 31:11.312
I'm used to _
conversations stopping
when I walk in the room.

31:11.450 --> 31:12.439
Never liked it.

31:12.700 --> 31:13.735
Press release just came out

31:13.830 --> 31:15.946
regarding Burns
leaving the force.

31:16.040 --> 31:18.281
There may be an investigation
into his past as well.

31:18.910 --> 31:21.287
What? Destroying one good cop
wasn't enough for you?

31:21.580 --> 31:23.832
No one is to have any contact
with A! Burns

31:23.960 --> 31:28.044
until the investigations into
Burns and Russo are complete.

31:28.130 --> 31:30.542
Unless you'd like to join him
in early retirement.

31:31.470 --> 31:32.459
Clear?

31:32.550 --> 31:34.006
Crystal.

31:34.140 --> 31:35.425
Good.

31:37.640 --> 31:38.880
So where are you going?

31:38.980 --> 31:41.050
To join Al in
early retirement.

31:41.150 --> 31:43.471
That's what I thought.
Have fun.

32:15.800 --> 32:17.597
That's gotta hurt.

32:18.100 --> 32:20.227
Sorry about that, Al.

32:20.350 --> 32:21.590
AL: Uncuff me, Tendler.

32:21.690 --> 32:23.590
As usual,
I'm one step ahead.

32:23.690 --> 32:25.180
Yeah? If you were
one step ahead,

32:25.310 --> 32:27.187
you wouldn't have
spent the last eight
years in prison.

32:27.270 --> 32:28.897
It happened
so fast, Officer.

32:29.030 --> 32:32.352
I heard someone breaking in,
and out of fear for my life,

32:32.490 --> 32:33.855
I grabbed a baseball bat.

32:33.990 --> 32:36.402
I struck the suspect
who pulled a gun on me.

32:36.530 --> 32:37.861
We wrestled for the gun and...

32:38.290 --> 32:39.325
Freeze!

32:40.000 --> 32:41.365
Drop your weapon.

32:41.660 --> 32:43.161
Thank God, Lieutenant.

32:43.710 --> 32:45.246
I was just about
to call you.

32:45.380 --> 32:47.029
You need to keep your partner
on a leash.

32:47.710 --> 32:49.951
I told you to leave it alone,
but you couldn't.

32:50.050 --> 32:52.257
You are officially
under arrest.

32:52.380 --> 32:53.460
You happy?

32:53.550 --> 32:54.710
Do I look happy?

32:55.180 --> 32:57.546
No, not really.

32:57.680 --> 32:58.806
What are you doing?
My job.

32:58.890 --> 33:00.460
Your job?
That's a laugh.

33:00.560 --> 33:02.130
Hey, could both of you
just shut up for a second?

33:02.230 --> 33:04.221
Hey, why don't you
tell her you were
just about to kill me?

33:04.310 --> 33:05.641
You ever heard about
"Stand your ground"?

33:05.730 --> 33:06.890
I was well within my rights.

33:06.980 --> 33:08.686
Oh, stand your ground,
you don't even know the law...

33:08.770 --> 33:10.021
I know the law
better than you do.

33:10.110 --> 33:11.566
Hey. Hey, you can't
go back there.

33:11.650 --> 33:14.062
You don't have a warrant.
I don't want you back there.

33:14.150 --> 33:15.731
You're right,
I don't have a warrant,

33:15.860 --> 33:17.236
but this is a search
incident to arrest,

33:17.320 --> 33:18.730
so I thought I'd
take a look around,

33:18.830 --> 33:20.479
make sure there are
no other suspects.

33:20.580 --> 33:22.741
AL: Get back here.
I'm not done
with you, Tendler.

33:33.760 --> 33:35.830
They found a letter
jammed in the back
of Russo's closet.

33:35.930 --> 33:37.136
I'm sorry
about the quality.

33:37.260 --> 33:38.887
I guess I must have rushed
when I scanned it.

33:47.690 --> 33:51.182
You're fine,
and you are headed
for Central Booking.

33:51.610 --> 33:52.725
You're under arrest.

33:52.820 --> 33:55.641
I've been thinking.
I've decided not
to press charges.

33:55.780 --> 33:59.739
I'm not the kind of guy
that locks up other cops,

34:00.160 --> 34:02.651
and I'm confident
that Lieutenant Burns
has learnt his lesson.

34:03.290 --> 34:06.362
As long as he's
willing to apologize.

34:06.460 --> 34:07.575
Not a chance.

34:08.460 --> 34:10.667
Seems like a generous
offer to me, Al.

34:12.300 --> 34:13.369
I'm sorry.

34:13.460 --> 34:14.506
Good.

34:14.630 --> 34:16.177
Water under the bridge,

34:16.300 --> 34:18.291
and thank you for coming
to my aid today.

34:18.640 --> 34:19.709
Sure.

34:19.800 --> 34:20.789
Here.

34:25.560 --> 34:26.879
AL: After you.

34:32.320 --> 34:34.060
The whole "Raging cop" thing
is getting tired.

34:34.490 --> 34:35.639
Find anything?

34:35.740 --> 34:38.982
I did.
I took this off
Tendler's printer.

34:39.110 --> 34:40.566
An ass-kissing letter

34:40.660 --> 34:42.821
from Tendler to
his parole officer?

34:43.200 --> 34:44.531
The lines,

34:44.660 --> 34:46.537
they match
the lines on the paper

34:46.660 --> 34:48.491
that was found in
Sandra's apartment.

34:48.870 --> 34:50.952
Tendler planted it.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.951
So why aren't we
arresting him right now?

34:53.050 --> 34:56.372
Because all the shit he stole
is still out there, so...

34:56.510 --> 34:58.000
Right,
and we find that,

34:58.090 --> 35:00.001
we also take down whoever
he's been working with.

35:00.140 --> 35:01.175
Precisely.

35:01.510 --> 35:02.636
You don't happen
to have any idea

35:02.720 --> 35:04.176
where Tendler's
keeping everything?

35:04.260 --> 35:06.012
Don't you think I would
have told you if I did?

35:06.100 --> 35:07.510
But I have a feeling

35:07.640 --> 35:09.187
that we're gonna
find out real soon.

35:09.270 --> 35:10.646
You seem pretty confident.

35:11.020 --> 35:12.556
I left him a message.

35:36.800 --> 35:38.711
You know, I gotta admit,
when you first told me

35:38.840 --> 35:41.582
the only way to get Tendler
was for me to quit the force,

35:41.720 --> 35:44.177
it seemed like a crazy idea,
even coming from you.

35:44.260 --> 35:46.057
You know, it got us
into Tendler's place,

35:46.180 --> 35:47.556
and like you said,
with Coates around,

35:47.640 --> 35:48.629
you weren't gonna
get a warrant,

35:48.730 --> 35:50.379
but an ex-cop
doesn't need a warrant.

35:50.810 --> 35:52.937
Now all we gotta do is
get Tendler to take the bait

35:53.060 --> 35:54.049
and free Russo.

35:54.900 --> 35:56.936
Well, that's gonna be
a piece of cake.

35:57.070 --> 35:58.105
There he is.

36:53.710 --> 36:54.950
Freeze, Tendler!

36:58.670 --> 37:00.797
Detective Wells,
this is a surprise.

37:00.920 --> 37:03.172
Ah, what can I say?
I'm full of surprises.

37:08.310 --> 37:09.425
Get down.

37:14.900 --> 37:15.889
Cover me.

38:03.360 --> 38:04.349
Ah!

38:23.000 --> 38:26.629
Okay, so wait,
A| quitting, right,
that's part of a plan too?

38:29.220 --> 38:30.847
I can't believe
you didn't tell us, Carrie.

38:32.390 --> 38:33.709
I'm sorry.

38:33.810 --> 38:35.380
I didn't want to get
you guys in any deeper

38:35.520 --> 38:37.056
than you needed
to be, that's all.

38:37.890 --> 38:40.017
Excuse me for a second.

38:43.780 --> 38:47.489
This is huge. We've got
Tendler dead to rights
on the murder.

38:47.570 --> 38:49.060
And with all
the contraband in there,

38:49.160 --> 38:50.559
it ought to keep us
busy for months,

38:50.660 --> 38:53.072
looking for new
cases against him
and his partners.

38:53.200 --> 38:54.690
A|| worked out,
then, huh?

38:55.250 --> 38:56.569
Where's Burns?

38:56.660 --> 38:58.912
I'd like to talk to him
about his vigilante act.

38:59.040 --> 39:01.076
Oh, come on.
You can't be serious.

39:01.170 --> 39:02.455
You're still
gunning for him?

39:02.590 --> 39:05.582
Actually, I wanted to see
if he wanted this back.

39:07.260 --> 39:08.796
You mind ifI
give him this?

39:08.930 --> 39:12.047
It was really nice
working with you,
Detective Wells.

39:14.390 --> 39:16.096
I hope you don't take this
the wrong way,

39:16.180 --> 39:19.968
but I'm definitely hoping
our paths never cross again.

39:20.440 --> 39:21.429
Oh, that's fine by me,

39:21.560 --> 39:23.312
but if you ever want a friend
in Internal Affairs,

39:23.440 --> 39:24.725
you know where I am.

39:24.820 --> 39:27.311
Take care.
Thank you.

39:35.490 --> 39:36.946
They're just
processing you out.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.496
Should be
a couple of minutes.

39:39.290 --> 39:40.780
Thank you.

39:41.460 --> 39:44.588
And thank everyone
for not giving up on me.

39:44.670 --> 39:47.457
You can tell 'em yourself
tomorrow at the office.

39:51.680 --> 39:54.217
IA knows
I framed Tendler.

39:54.970 --> 39:56.050
How'd they find out?

39:57.270 --> 39:58.419
I told them.

39:59.600 --> 40:02.228
When they came to
tell me about Tendler
and to release me,

40:02.310 --> 40:05.689
I just told 'em.

40:05.820 --> 40:07.685
But I left you out of it.

40:07.820 --> 40:08.935
It ends here with me,

40:09.030 --> 40:11.021
where it started,
and that's it.

40:11.780 --> 40:12.849
I'm tired, Al.

40:13.620 --> 40:17.283
I've been living with this
every day since I did it.

40:17.540 --> 40:18.939
So have I.

40:21.830 --> 40:23.070
You feel guilty?

40:23.170 --> 40:24.376
Oh, hell, yeah.

40:24.500 --> 40:26.832
Well, you should.
You screwed up.
You listened to me.

40:28.880 --> 40:31.166
You want to balance
your books with the universe?

40:33.220 --> 40:34.881
Just stay a cop.

40:43.690 --> 40:44.930
Mmm

40:58.870 --> 41:00.906
Company

41:01.500 --> 41:03.206
Is this the part
where you throw
it into the ocean

41:03.290 --> 41:05.497
and say you don't want
to do this anymore?

41:05.580 --> 41:08.208
I can't deny
it's crossing my mind.

41:08.920 --> 41:09.875
Evidence report?

41:10.010 --> 41:10.999
AL: Uh-huh.

41:13.720 --> 41:15.176
I don't know.

41:19.060 --> 41:20.880
Do you remember
what you said to me

41:20.970 --> 41:23.177
when you asked me to come back
and be a cop again?

41:25.440 --> 41:26.976
You're the one
with the memory.

41:28.320 --> 41:31.062
I said that this
memory of mine,

41:31.190 --> 41:33.181
this gift, this curse,
whatever it is,

41:33.280 --> 41:37.364
made it impossible
for me to do this job

41:37.700 --> 41:38.860
and keep my sanity.

41:38.950 --> 41:42.249
I said that I couldn't do it,
and you said...

41:42.410 --> 41:46.449
That you're a cop,
whether you like it or not.

41:46.580 --> 41:47.660
And so are you.

41:48.080 --> 41:49.786
You help
a lot of people, Al.

41:51.840 --> 41:53.796
Besides,
you don't have a choice.

41:54.300 --> 41:55.426
You have to come back.

41:56.130 --> 41:58.348
Oh, really?
How do you figure?

41:58.430 --> 42:00.091
Because I can't
live Without you,

42:01.510 --> 42:03.216
and you can't live
without me.

42:04.810 --> 42:06.687
I can hear them say

42:09.440 --> 42:11.647
Bad company

42:11.780 --> 42:14.146
And I won't deny

42:17.070 --> 42:20.324
Bad, bad company

42:20.450 --> 42:22.441
Till the day I die

42:25.120 --> 42:26.109
Oh, yeah

42:26.250 --> 42:28.707
Till the day I die

42:28.790 --> 42:32.794
Ooh ooh ooh
