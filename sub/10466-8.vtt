21:04.480 --> 21:08.658
ANYWAY, HE'S CLAIMING
THAT I OVERCHARGED HIM,
AND HE STARTS WHALING ON ME.

21:08.658 --> 21:10.791
SO WHAT DID
YOU DO, MAN?

21:10.791 --> 21:13.010
I GAVE HIM 50 BUCKS
AND TOLD HIM TO GET
THE HELL OUTTA THERE,

21:13.010 --> 21:15.839
'CAUSE, YOU KNOW,
HEY, I GOT A WEDDING
TO GO TO, RIGHT?

21:15.839 --> 21:17.972
WELL, LOOK,
I'M FINE, JULIA.

21:17.972 --> 21:21.236
I JUST GOTTA GET CLEANED UP,
AND THEN I'M ALL YOURS.

21:22.803 --> 21:24.021
YOU COMING?

21:28.809 --> 21:30.376
I FEEL BAD.

21:30.376 --> 21:32.639
THAT'S OK, NATTY.
HE'S GONNA BE OK.

21:32.639 --> 21:34.380
HE'S GONNA NEED
A CLEAN SHIRT.

21:34.380 --> 21:36.773
I'M SURE CHARLIE'S GOT
PLENTY OF CLEAN SHIRTS.

21:36.773 --> 21:38.166
I FEEL REALLY BAD.

21:38.166 --> 21:39.907
I THINK SHE'S
FEELING GUILTY.

21:39.907 --> 21:40.908
[VOMITING]

21:40.908 --> 21:42.605
NATTY!

21:42.605 --> 21:45.260
WHOA! THAT IS
DEFINITELY MORE
THAN ONE ROSE.

21:53.921 --> 21:56.837
CAN YOU BELIEVE I'M
GONNA LOOK LIKE THIS
IN ALL THE PICTURES?

21:56.837 --> 21:59.187
HAVE TO DO A LOT OF
THOSE KISSING SHOTS, HUH?

21:59.187 --> 22:00.449
HIDE MY FACE?

22:02.886 --> 22:04.148
I'M SORRY, JULIA.

22:06.281 --> 22:07.935
I WANT TO KNOW WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED TO YOU.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.113
I TOLD YOU. THIS GUY--

22:12.113 --> 22:14.420
I DON'T BELIEVE YOU.

22:14.420 --> 22:17.466
WHAT? IN THE 30 SECONDS
IT TAKES TO CHECK
THE LOCK

22:17.466 --> 22:20.339
ON THE FRONT DOOR OF YOUR
SHOP, SOME GUY HAPPENS TO
SHOW UP AND DO THIS TO YOU?

22:20.339 --> 22:21.775
I SWEAR TO GOD.

22:21.775 --> 22:23.211
YOU'RE AN HOUR LATE,
GRIFFIN.

22:23.211 --> 22:25.909
IT TOOK HIM AN HOUR
TO BEAT YOU UP?

22:28.216 --> 22:30.174
YOU CAN'T LIE
TO ME TODAY.

22:30.174 --> 22:31.480
NOT TODAY.

22:33.047 --> 22:34.353
YOU HAVE TO TELL ME.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.318
I'M HAVING SOME TROUBLE
WITH THIS GUY.

22:43.318 --> 22:44.798
I MEAN, SOME BUSINESS GUY.

22:47.975 --> 22:50.020
IT'S--IT'S HARD, YOU KNOW.

22:50.020 --> 22:52.501
I'M JUST STARTING OUT,

22:52.501 --> 22:55.374
AND THEY OPENED THIS SHOP UP
3 BLOCKS AWAY FROM MINE.

22:55.374 --> 22:58.942
AND I CAN'T--
JULIA, I CAN'T
COMPETE WITH THAT.

22:58.942 --> 23:01.249
YOU KNOW? SO...

23:03.469 --> 23:07.647
SO I B-BORROWED SOME MONEY
FROM THIS GUY.

23:07.647 --> 23:09.562
WHAT?I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.

23:09.562 --> 23:11.781
EVERYTHING WILL BE FINE,
I PROMISE.

23:11.781 --> 23:13.870
WHAT? LOOK AT
WHAT HE DID TO YOU.

23:13.870 --> 23:16.133
NO, NO, IT'S NOT LIKE THAT.

23:16.133 --> 23:18.048
IT'S--IT'S NOT
WHAT YOU THINK.

23:18.048 --> 23:20.268
IT'S NOT LIKE
HE'S GONNA KILL ME
OR ANYTHING.

23:20.268 --> 23:23.793
IT'S JUST HE'S A JERK,
AND HE GOT MAD.

23:23.793 --> 23:27.144
AND I'LL PAY HIM OFF,
AND HE'LL BE OUT
OF MY LIFE.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.673
JULIA...

23:33.673 --> 23:35.979
HEY, YOU GUYS.
EVERYBODY DECENT?

23:35.979 --> 23:38.678
OK, I WANT TO GET
SOME CANDID FOOTAGE
OF YOU TWO

23:38.678 --> 23:41.071
GETTING READY FOR THE CEREMONY.NOT NOW.

23:41.071 --> 23:43.291
YES, NOW.
LATER WILL BE TOO LATE.

23:43.291 --> 23:45.902
SO DO SOMETHING...
DO SOMETHING CANDID.

23:45.902 --> 23:46.947
FIX HIS TIE, JULE.

23:46.947 --> 23:48.949
CLAUDIA.WHAT?!

23:48.949 --> 23:50.603
WHAT? WHY IS EVERYBODY
ACTING LIKE I'M SUCH
A BIG NAG,

23:50.603 --> 23:52.387
WHEN ALL I'M
TRYING TO DO

23:52.387 --> 23:55.695
IS PRESERVE A FEW PRECIOUS
MOMENTS FOR POSTERITY, HMM?

23:55.695 --> 23:58.088
[POUNDING,
PEOPLE SHOUTING]

23:58.088 --> 23:59.786
THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING.

24:00.917 --> 24:01.831
NATALIE!

24:03.964 --> 24:07.489
SWEETHEART, JUST TRY
AND TURN THE SILVER KNOB.

24:07.489 --> 24:08.969
I CAN'T, MOMMY.

24:08.969 --> 24:10.971
THIS LOCK IS JAMMED.
MAYBE A SCREWDRIVER...

24:10.971 --> 24:12.276
MOMMY, GET ME
OUT OF HERE!

24:12.276 --> 24:13.495
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

24:13.495 --> 24:14.888
SHE LOCKED
HERSELF IN.

24:14.888 --> 24:16.063
[CRYING]
MOMMY, I'M TRYING.

24:16.063 --> 24:17.368
NATALIE, SWEETHEART...
STOP.

24:17.368 --> 24:18.892
OK, JUST STOP CRYING.

24:18.892 --> 24:20.502
Annie: PLEASE.THIS IS DIFFERENT.

24:20.502 --> 24:22.939
CALM DOWN,
SWEETIE.

24:22.939 --> 24:25.986
NO, COME--
LISTEN, MOMMY'S
RIGHT HERE.

24:25.986 --> 24:28.989
SWEETHEART,
JUST TRY TO FIND
THE LITTLE SILVER KNOB.

24:28.989 --> 24:31.731
IF I CAN FIND SOMETHING
TO PRY OPEN THAT DOOR WITH.

24:31.731 --> 24:33.907
HOLD THESE FOR ME,
WILL YOU?

24:33.907 --> 24:36.300
IT'S KIND OF A GIFT,
DON'T YOU THINK?

24:36.300 --> 24:37.911
Annie: NATALIE,
SWEETHEART, STOP.

24:37.911 --> 24:39.347
HER WAY OF
ALWAYS BECOMING

24:39.347 --> 24:40.304
THE CENTER
OF ATTENTION.

24:40.304 --> 24:41.741

24:41.741 --> 24:44.308
NATALIE, JUST
LISTEN TO MOMMY, OK?

24:44.308 --> 24:46.963
IT'S OK. STOP CRYING.

24:46.963 --> 24:48.617
YOU DON'T SEE IT,
DO YOU?

24:48.617 --> 24:50.140
IT'S OK.

24:50.140 --> 24:52.229
CALM DOWN, NATALIE.
IT'S OK.

24:52.229 --> 24:53.753
WE DID THIS ALL THE TIME
IN COLLEGE.

24:53.753 --> 24:55.319
EXCUSE ME. OK.

24:55.319 --> 24:56.973
OH, GREAT.

24:56.973 --> 24:58.366
I'LL TRY AND FIDDLE
WITH THE LOCK HERE.

24:58.366 --> 25:00.020
HEY, NATALIE.
NATALIE...

25:00.020 --> 25:02.239
TAKE A STEP BACK
FROM THE DOOR,
OK, SWEETHEART?

25:02.239 --> 25:03.980
I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS.

25:03.980 --> 25:05.808
I JUST WANT
TO KILL MYSELF.

25:05.808 --> 25:07.767
HEY, NATALIE,
LET'S SING A SONG, OK?

I'M TELLING YOU
THAT LITTLE GIRL--

25:49.460 --> 25:51.114
SHE LOCKED HERSELF
IN THE BATHROOM
BY MISTAKE,

25:51.114 --> 25:52.594
SO THEY'VE GOT LIKE--

25:54.509 --> 25:55.815
COFFEE DIDN'T HELP, HUH?

25:55.815 --> 25:57.164
DAMN, I TOLD
THAT CATERER--

25:57.164 --> 25:58.557
I DON'T HAVE
A HANGOVER, NINA.

25:58.557 --> 26:00.689
I'VE GOT CANCER, OK?

26:00.689 --> 26:02.778
I KNOW THAT, CHARLIE.

26:02.778 --> 26:04.258
YOU THINK
I DON'T KNOW THAT?

26:06.652 --> 26:08.262
I'M NOT SURE.

26:10.873 --> 26:13.659
'CAUSE IT REALLY
FEELS LIKE IT'S NOT
REGISTERING WITH YOU.

26:16.052 --> 26:20.187
HOW CAN YOU--
GOD, CHARLIE.

26:21.405 --> 26:24.321
LOOK, I'M SCARED.

26:24.321 --> 26:26.106
I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE
JUST RAN OVER ME
WITH A TRUCK,

26:26.106 --> 26:28.195
AND IT SCARES ME,
ALL RIGHT?

26:28.195 --> 26:30.153
I'M UP HERE TRYING
TO FIGURE OUT HOW
TO KEEP THAT FROM YOU

26:30.153 --> 26:33.374
BECAUSE THIS THING'S,
LIKE, GOT YOU
SO FREAKED OUT,

26:33.374 --> 26:35.202
YOU'RE ACTING
LIKE IT'S NOTHING,

26:35.202 --> 26:36.943
AND IT'S
SO NOT NOTHING.

26:36.943 --> 26:42.557
I DIDN'T--LOOK,
I NEVER SAID--

26:42.557 --> 26:46.300
WHEN I TOLD YOU
THAT YOU WERE
GOING TO BE OK,

26:46.300 --> 26:49.042
IT'S BECAUSE I
HONESTLY BELIEVE
THAT YOU WILL.

26:49.042 --> 26:51.784
NOW, I MEAN,
WAS THAT A MISTAKE?

26:51.784 --> 26:54.787
IS IT NOT WHAT YOU
WANT TO HEAR?

26:54.787 --> 26:58.617
YOU KNOW, YOU SAY
THAT ONCE OR TWICE, NINA,
AND IT FEELS GREAT.

26:58.617 --> 27:01.184
IT FEELS LIKE
THIS INCREDIBLE SUPPORT,

27:01.184 --> 27:05.188
BUT WHEN IT'S ALL YOU SAY,
IT FEELS LIKE DENIAL.

27:05.188 --> 27:07.060
LIKE THAT HAS TO BE TRUE

27:07.060 --> 27:09.236
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T
EVEN BEGIN TO FACE
THE ALTERNATIVE.

27:16.635 --> 27:18.724
I THINK YOU SHOULD
TELL YOUR FAMILY.

27:21.422 --> 27:22.641
WHAT?

27:22.641 --> 27:24.294
TELL THEM,
PLEASE, CHARLIE,

27:24.294 --> 27:26.862
I MEAN, THE--
YOU NEED SOMETHING.

27:26.862 --> 27:28.777
THERE'S SOMETHING
IN YOUR MIND,

27:28.777 --> 27:31.737
SOME WAY THAT
YOU EXPECT PEOPLE
TO COME THROUGH FOR YOU.

27:31.737 --> 27:34.217
AND OBVIOUSLY,
YOU THINK I'M
FLUNKING OUT HERE,

27:34.217 --> 27:36.524
SO LET THEM IN.

27:36.524 --> 27:37.786
MAYBE THEY CAN
HELP YOU.

27:37.786 --> 27:39.527
I'M NOT GOING
TO DO THAT.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.094
PLEASE, CHARLIE,
PLEASE!

27:41.094 --> 27:42.965
DON'T PUT THIS
ALL ON ME! TELL THEM.

27:42.965 --> 27:44.924
NO, NOT TODAY.

27:44.924 --> 27:47.622
TODAY IS ABOUT JULIA.
JUST JULIA.

27:49.363 --> 27:52.714
THIS IS, LIKE,
A PERFECT NIGHT FOR HER,

27:52.714 --> 27:54.760
AND I'M NOT GOING TO LET
ANYTHING RUIN IT.

28:05.771 --> 28:07.947
[SIGHS]

28:07.947 --> 28:10.427
SO, HOW LONG, HUH?

28:10.427 --> 28:13.996
HOW LONG HAS THE BUSINESS
BEEN IN TROUBLE?

28:13.996 --> 28:17.478
IT'S NOT IN TROUBLE...
EXACTLY.

28:21.308 --> 28:24.180
IT'S--IT'S
A COUPLE OF MONTHS.

28:24.180 --> 28:27.444
A COUPLE OF MONTHS?

28:27.444 --> 28:30.404
AND--AND YOU DIDN'T
SAY ANYTHING?

28:30.404 --> 28:34.669
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO HAVE TO WORRY.
JULIA.

28:34.669 --> 28:37.628
NO, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
I'M TRYING TO, UM,

28:37.628 --> 28:38.891
SO YOU WOULD
COME HOME FROM WORK

28:38.891 --> 28:41.023
AND I WOULD SAY
HOW WAS YOUR DAY,

28:41.023 --> 28:43.504
AND YOU WOULD SAY
GREAT, AND ALL ALONG
YOU'VE BEEN LYING TO ME?

28:43.504 --> 28:45.071
I WAS PROTECTING YOU.

28:45.071 --> 28:48.248
RIGHT! FROM THE TRUTH,
WHICH I DESERVE TO KNOW.

28:48.248 --> 28:51.294
GOD, GRIFFIN,
I AM YOUR WIFE.

28:51.294 --> 28:53.427
YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN HANDLE BAD NEWS?

28:53.427 --> 28:55.821
I DON'T KNOW.
LOOK HOW YOU'RE
HANDLING IT NOW.

28:55.821 --> 28:57.736
I JUST SHOULDN'T
HAVE TOLD YOU.

28:57.736 --> 28:59.781
YOU KNOW WHAT?
MAYBE IF YOU TRUSTED ME
FROM THE BEGINNING,

28:59.781 --> 29:01.740
THINGS WOULDN'T
HAVE GOTTEN SO BAD.

29:01.740 --> 29:04.264
BECAUSE YOU WOULD
HAVE STEPPED IN AND
MADE EVERYTHING BETTER?

29:04.264 --> 29:06.919
WOW, JULIA.

29:06.919 --> 29:09.051
IT'S THE SAME
OLD STORY.

29:09.051 --> 29:10.618
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
HAVE TRUSTED ME.

29:10.618 --> 29:11.837
WHAT IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

29:11.837 --> 29:13.708
YOU EXPECT ME
TO SCREW UP.

29:13.708 --> 29:16.842
THIS JUST PROVES
EVERYTHING YOU EVER
THOUGHT ABOUT ME.

29:16.842 --> 29:18.887
HOW I MAKE
LOUSY DECISIONS.

29:18.887 --> 29:21.934
HOW I CAN'T
HANDLE STUFF. BUT
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

29:21.934 --> 29:23.283
IF THAT GUY WOULDN'T
HAVE DONE A NUMBER
ON MY FACE,

29:23.283 --> 29:24.893
I WOULD HAVE
FIXED THIS

29:24.893 --> 29:26.199
AND YOU WOULD HAVE
NEVER FOUND OUT
ABOUT IT.

29:26.199 --> 29:27.896
AND THAT WOULD
HAVE BEEN A GOOD THING?

29:27.896 --> 29:29.768
GOD, GRIFFIN,
WHAT DOES THAT
SAY ABOUT US?

29:29.768 --> 29:32.118
WHY DOES IT
HAVE TO SAY
ANYTHING ABOUT US?

29:32.118 --> 29:34.033
THIS WAS
A BUSINESS THING.

29:34.033 --> 29:36.862
IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO'S IN TROUBLE.

29:36.862 --> 29:37.950
THAT'S WHAT YOU THINK,
RIGHT?

29:39.081 --> 29:40.953
YES.

29:40.953 --> 29:43.303
BUT SEE, WHEN
YOU'RE IN TROUBLE,
I'M IN TROUBLE.

29:43.303 --> 29:44.913
WE'RE MARRIED, GRIFFIN.

29:44.913 --> 29:46.828
THIS IS OUR LIFE
TOGETHER.

29:46.828 --> 29:48.047
OBVIOUSLY.

29:48.047 --> 29:50.049
AND FOR MONTHS!

29:50.049 --> 29:52.660
NOW, MONTHS,
YOU LET ME THINK--

29:54.618 --> 29:57.404
I MEAN, GOD,
EVERY SECOND
I'VE BEEN HAPPY

29:57.404 --> 30:01.103
AND YOU HAVEN'T BEEN
BECAUSE OF THIS.

30:01.103 --> 30:02.888
DON'T YOU GET IT?
IT DOESN'T COUNT.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.846
JULIA. IT DOESN'T COUNT.DON'T SAY THAT.

30:04.846 --> 30:06.543
AND NOW WE HAVE
TO GO DOWNSTAIRS,

30:06.543 --> 30:08.632
AND WE HAVE TO MAKE
THOSE PROMISES
ALL OVER AGAIN--

30:08.632 --> 30:11.766
LOVE AND TRUST,
AND RICHER AND POORER.

30:11.766 --> 30:15.030
JULIA, COME ON.TELL ME HOW DO THAT, GRIFFIN?

30:15.030 --> 30:18.904
HOW? WHEN I KNOW
IT DIDN'T MEAN ANYTHING

30:18.904 --> 30:21.428
THE FIRST TIME
WE SAID IT.

30:34.049 --> 30:35.964
[SIGHS]
LOOK,

30:35.964 --> 30:39.446
LET'S JUST--
LET'S JUST DEAL
WITH THIS LATER, OK?

30:39.446 --> 30:41.274
I MEAN, NOW
WE SHOULD JUST
GO OUT THERE

30:41.274 --> 30:42.623
AND CHECK
ON THE MINISTER AND
THAT LITTLE GIRL.

30:42.623 --> 30:44.059
YOU'RE NOT GOING
TO STAY, ARE YOU?

30:44.059 --> 30:45.713
WHAT?
I JUST SAID WE--

30:45.713 --> 30:48.542
NO, I DON'T MEAN
TONIGHT.

30:48.542 --> 30:50.544

30:54.983 --> 30:56.593
ALL THE HOSPITALS
AND THE TREATMENTS

30:56.593 --> 30:59.553
AND BEING SICK
AND TAKING CARE OF ME.

31:02.208 --> 31:05.472
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE
ABLE TO MAKE IT THROUGH
ALL OF THAT, ARE YOU?

31:05.472 --> 31:09.606
I DON'T--GOD, HOW--
THIS IS WAY TOO SOON.

31:09.606 --> 31:11.608

ME TO PREDICT
THE FUTURE.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.438
I GUESS SO.

31:15.438 --> 31:16.787
WELL, I CAN'T
DO THAT.

31:16.787 --> 31:19.486
YES, YOU CAN.

31:19.486 --> 31:22.097
SOMETIMES YOU CAN.

31:22.097 --> 31:25.535

LET'S JUST TAKE THIS
AS IT COMES, OK?

31:28.495 --> 31:32.325
JUST LET ME
GET USED TO IT,
AND WE'LL SEE.

31:32.325 --> 31:34.762
NINA, I CAN'T
JUST WAIT AND SEE.

31:34.762 --> 31:38.984
OK? I DON'T EVEN KNOW
IF I CAN HANDLE
BEING SICK.

31:38.984 --> 31:42.988
I'M REALLY--
I'M REALLY SCARED
ABOUT THAT.

FROM ME?

31:50.038 --> 31:52.823
DO YOU WANT ME
TO SAY THAT I'M
A HORRIBLE PERSON?

31:52.823 --> 31:55.522
THAT MY BOYFRIEND
IS SICK AND I WANT
TO RUN AWAY?

31:55.522 --> 32:01.658

YOU DO FOR PEOPLE

IF YOU KNOW THAT
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE
ABLE TO HANDLE IT.

MADE IT EASIER?

YOU KNOW?

37:52.531 --> 37:53.488
BUT HERE YOU ARE.

37:58.363 --> 38:00.190
I GUESS THAT'S JUST
THE WAY IT WORKS,
YOU KNOW.

38:00.190 --> 38:02.802
YOU DON'T REALLY--
YOU DON'T GET
TO CHOOSE.

38:02.802 --> 38:06.196
YOU JUST--
YOU JUST FALL.

38:07.546 --> 38:10.026
AND THEN YOU HAVE
THIS PERSON.

38:10.026 --> 38:15.945
THIS WEIRD PERSON

38:15.945 --> 38:18.905
WHO'S ALL WRONG
AND ALL RIGHT
AT THE SAME TIME.

38:21.603 --> 38:22.865
YEAH.

38:25.868 --> 38:27.174

38:46.759 --> 38:49.065
CAN I CALL YOU?

38:49.065 --> 38:52.242

WANT TO KNOW

38:52.242 --> 38:55.463

HOW YOU'RE DOING.

THAT SOUNDED NICE.

39:11.087 --> 39:12.872
SO, THEN, UM...

39:15.178 --> 39:16.919
THIS ISN'T
REALLY GOOD-BYE.

39:19.966 --> 39:22.272
NOT TECHNICALLY.

39:24.623 --> 39:25.885
RIGHT.

39:32.979 --> 39:33.980
NINA.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.160
YOU KNOW
WHAT I DON'T GET?

39:43.511 --> 39:45.165
THE WHOLE BIRD THING.

39:46.906 --> 39:49.822
I MEAN, YOU-- YOU TAKE THESE
HALF-DEAD ANIMALS

39:49.822 --> 39:51.998
AND YOU--YOU NURSE THEM
BACK TO HEALTH,

39:51.998 --> 39:54.392
AND YOU'RE INCREDIBLE
AT IT, AND YOU LOVE IT.

39:59.614 --> 40:01.573
SO, THEN WHY--

40:03.052 --> 40:05.838
THEY'RE JUST BIRDS,
CHARLIE.

40:08.971 --> 40:10.320
RIGHT.

40:34.867 --> 40:36.259
GRIFFIN.

40:47.575 --> 40:49.316
IT'S GONNA CHANGE.

40:51.013 --> 40:52.058
ALL OF IT.

40:54.103 --> 40:57.542
EVERYTHING'S GOING
TO BE DIFFERENT
FROM NOW ON.

40:57.542 --> 41:00.893
I GUESS SO.

41:00.893 --> 41:03.025
I'M GONNA TRY
TO HOLD ON TO THE SHOP,

41:03.025 --> 41:04.810
BUT I DON'T KNOW
IF I CAN.

41:07.900 --> 41:10.468
I DON'T THINK WE'RE
GOING TO BE ABLE
TO KEEP THE APARTMENT.

41:11.599 --> 41:13.079
RIGHT.

41:15.864 --> 41:18.084
AND I THINK, UH,

41:18.084 --> 41:19.868
I THINK MAYBE
YOU SHOULD, UH...

41:21.653 --> 41:23.306
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO HAVE TO,
BUT I THINK--

41:23.306 --> 41:25.221
I NEED TO GET A JOB.

41:27.528 --> 41:28.877
I'M SORRY.

41:34.448 --> 41:38.191
BUT MAYBE, UH,

41:38.191 --> 41:39.235
MAYBE WE'RE
NOT GONNA MAKE IT.

41:43.762 --> 41:45.372
WHAT?

41:46.982 --> 41:49.071
HOW CAN YOU
SAY THAT?

41:49.071 --> 41:52.422
I MEAN, GRIFFIN,
THIS STUFF IS BAD.

41:52.422 --> 41:55.513
AND I'M UPSET,
AND I'M SCARED,

41:55.513 --> 41:57.253
AND I DON'T KNOW
HOW THINGS ARE
GOING TO TURN OUT,

41:57.253 --> 42:01.257
BUT, I MEAN,
I LOVE YOU.

42:03.172 --> 42:05.435
I LOVE YOU, TOO.

42:09.135 --> 42:11.920
MAYBE LOVING EACH OTHER
ISN'T ENOUGH.

42:11.920 --> 42:15.228
YES, IT IS.

42:15.228 --> 42:16.925
IT IS.

42:16.925 --> 42:21.016
GOD, THAT IS
EVERYTHING.

42:21.016 --> 42:25.760
NO. THAT'S--THAT'S JUST
WHAT WE START OFF WITH.

42:25.760 --> 42:28.154
IT'S WHAT EVERYBODY
STARTS OFF WITH.

42:28.154 --> 42:33.899
ALL THOSE COUPLES
THAT GOT MARRIED
TOO YOUNG OR TOO FAST--

42:33.899 --> 42:36.423
THEY WERE ALL
IN LOVE, JULIA.

42:36.423 --> 42:38.381
HOW ARE WE
ANY DIFFERENT?

42:39.948 --> 42:43.082
BECAUSE WE ARE.

42:43.082 --> 42:45.563
BECAUSE WE'RE
NOT GOING TO BE
A STATISTIC.

42:48.740 --> 42:51.307
OK, YOU WANT ODDS?

42:51.307 --> 42:52.700
SAY IT'S 1 IN 5.

42:52.700 --> 42:54.572
SAY IT'S 1 IN 10.

42:54.572 --> 42:56.922
IT COULD BE
1 IN 100.

42:58.010 --> 42:59.794
SO WHAT?

42:59.794 --> 43:03.276
WE COULD BE
THAT ONE COUPLE
WHO MAKES IT.

43:03.276 --> 43:05.365
YOU THINK
IT'S THAT SIMPLE?

43:05.365 --> 43:09.674
YES. BECAUSE IT IS.

43:09.674 --> 43:12.894
BECAUSE, GRIFFIN,
THIS IS JUST A FORK
IN THE ROAD.

43:12.894 --> 43:15.244
AND WE HAVE
CHOICES HERE.

43:15.244 --> 43:18.465
WE CAN SAY
THIS IS TOO HARD
AND WE QUIT,

43:18.465 --> 43:21.294
OR WE CAN SAY
THIS IS THE BAD PART

43:21.294 --> 43:24.602
AND THE GOOD PART
IS JUST AROUND THE CORNER.

43:26.038 --> 43:27.517
IT'S A CHOICE.

43:27.517 --> 43:29.215
THAT'S ALL IT IS.

43:33.959 --> 43:37.005
LET'S DECIDE...

43:37.005 --> 43:39.617
HERE AND NOW
THAT WE'RE GOING
TO MAKE IT.

43:42.228 --> 43:45.361
I MEAN, DON'T YOU
WANT THAT?

43:45.361 --> 43:49.801
OH, YES. GOD, YES.

43:51.150 --> 43:52.760
ME, TOO.

43:53.979 --> 43:55.589
MORE THAN ANYTHING.

43:58.766 --> 44:01.987
SO, YOU REALLY LOVE ME?

44:05.991 --> 44:07.906
I DO.
