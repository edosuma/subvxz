02:44.911 --> 02:48.414
We are not quite certain how
it happened, Your Majesty.

02:48.415 --> 02:52.585
Whether it was a hidden rock or a storm.

02:52.586 --> 02:54.887
But there were no survivors.

02:57.224 --> 02:58.958
Not even my son?

02:58.959 --> 03:01.360
I am deeply sorry, Your Majesty.

03:01.361 --> 03:05.197
I'll marry, Father, and have a baby boy.

03:05.198 --> 03:07.199
That's very sweet of you, Maud.

03:07.200 --> 03:10.970
But I don't think I'll live long
enough for him to come of age.

03:12.973 --> 03:14.940
Who will rule once I am gone?

03:20.147 --> 03:21.680
There's Gloucester.

03:21.681 --> 03:24.283
The king's bastard? He will never inherit.

03:24.284 --> 03:27.520
There's the king's legitimate daughter, Maud.

03:27.521 --> 03:29.989
A child. And female.

03:29.990 --> 03:32.024
Then, I suppose, there's me.

03:33.060 --> 03:35.461
But I'm only the king's nephew.

03:35.462 --> 03:36.629
And...

03:37.931 --> 03:42.568
grandson of William the Conqueror.

03:42.569 --> 03:45.504
This shipwreck puts you in
direct line to the throne,

03:45.505 --> 03:47.840
my good Stephen,

03:47.841 --> 03:50.676
which we will support when the time comes.

03:50.677 --> 03:52.311
Since, unlike the king,

03:52.312 --> 03:54.580
you hold the Church in high esteem.

03:54.581 --> 03:57.817
The Church has been very
good to me, Your Eminence.

03:57.818 --> 04:00.519
Father Waleran here can attest to that.

04:00.520 --> 04:02.988
Still, there are whispers.

04:02.989 --> 04:05.458
The shipwreck was quite convenient.

04:05.459 --> 04:07.626
Rumours born of jealousy, Your Eminence.

04:07.627 --> 04:09.528
What happened was ordained by God.

04:09.529 --> 04:12.331
It's to the Church's benefit that no one survived.

05:09.789 --> 05:11.157
Brother Cuthbert!

05:12.359 --> 05:13.392
Philip!

05:14.394 --> 05:16.128
A sight for old eyes!

05:16.129 --> 05:19.932
Not that old, my friend. So good to see you.

05:19.933 --> 05:21.600
So good to see you.

05:21.601 --> 05:23.736
We didn't expect you.

05:23.737 --> 05:25.371
I've missed you, Philip.

05:25.372 --> 05:27.706
When did the tower collapse?

05:27.707 --> 05:29.341
Oh, last winter.

05:29.342 --> 05:32.811
Brother Remigius says we
haven't the funds to repair it.

05:32.812 --> 05:34.313
Brother Remigius?

05:34.314 --> 05:36.916
He's acting prior now, soon to take over.

05:38.852 --> 05:43.455
Prior James, I fear, won't last the week.

05:50.063 --> 05:52.665
Father, it's Philip.

05:54.267 --> 05:55.834
Ph... Philip?

05:57.437 --> 06:00.973
I told Remigius to send for you.

06:00.974 --> 06:03.976
I have something to confess. I was sent for?

06:03.977 --> 06:08.147
Many years ago, the man survived the shipwreck,

06:08.148 --> 06:11.750
but I was ordered to arrest him.

06:11.751 --> 06:13.452
Sorry, I don't...

06:14.754 --> 06:18.324
He was innocent. He was innocent.

06:18.325 --> 06:19.391
Who?

06:19.392 --> 06:22.094
The Frenchman.

06:22.095 --> 06:24.897
He saw what happened to the ship.

06:26.700 --> 06:28.367
He knew!

06:28.368 --> 06:30.569
He knew too much.

06:30.570 --> 06:32.504
Welcome, Philip.

06:32.505 --> 06:33.572
Brother Remigius...

06:34.774 --> 06:37.476
The Prior told me he asked you to send for me.

06:37.477 --> 06:39.745
I was about to.

06:39.746 --> 06:43.082
Poor Father. His mind is gone.

06:56.096 --> 06:59.498
Some children are... They're...

07:01.101 --> 07:03.636
They're born willful, my good Percy.

07:03.637 --> 07:04.970
I must warn you,

07:06.306 --> 07:09.508
my daughter has turned down more suitors

07:09.509 --> 07:12.478
than there are stones in Shiring Castle.

07:12.479 --> 07:15.014
You need to be more forceful with her then.

07:15.015 --> 07:17.182
Well, I have tried.

07:17.183 --> 07:20.919
But I made a promise to Aliena's mother.

07:22.255 --> 07:24.923
The girl could choose her own husband.

07:24.924 --> 07:27.860
Ah! I've never heard of such a thing!

07:27.861 --> 07:29.762
This marriage would be

07:29.763 --> 07:31.697
advantageous to all, Lord Shiring.

07:31.698 --> 07:33.232
My son would gain a title,

07:33.233 --> 07:36.468
and your daughter, some of the richest farmland.

07:36.469 --> 07:39.938
The way to my daughter's
heart is through affection,

07:39.939 --> 07:41.807
not advantage.

07:41.808 --> 07:44.810
Isn't that true, Richard? Then we needn't worry.

07:44.811 --> 07:46.945
Our William will work his charms on her,

07:46.946 --> 07:48.914
and true love will win the day.

08:11.438 --> 08:14.340
A dog will suit you better
for a wife, Lord William!

08:14.341 --> 08:16.442
A dog, for your safety, with no teeth!

08:16.443 --> 08:20.279
Why don't you get cats, Lord William?

08:26.286 --> 08:28.120
Oh dear!

08:28.121 --> 08:30.622
You're a fool, William!

08:30.623 --> 08:33.424
All this could have been
ours if only you'd just...

08:33.426 --> 08:34.426
Hey!

08:45.038 --> 08:46.872
Aliena...

08:48.675 --> 08:49.708
Father...

08:53.780 --> 08:55.381
Oh, I love you so!

09:01.087 --> 09:03.055
Quickly, boy! Quickly!

09:04.424 --> 09:07.159
All right, Jack, you can offload here.

09:07.160 --> 09:09.361
Alfred, take over, will you?

09:09.362 --> 09:11.530
All right, men, stack them neat.

09:11.531 --> 09:13.766
Don't just drop them on the floor.

09:13.767 --> 09:16.568
A sloppy worksite means careless building.

09:16.569 --> 09:19.505
Bring me an axe-hammer!

09:21.141 --> 09:23.375
How you feeling, love?

09:23.376 --> 09:26.211
It doesn't like hard work, that's for sure,

09:26.212 --> 09:27.713
which means it's a boy.

09:27.714 --> 09:28.847
Huh!

09:28.848 --> 09:30.282
There's magic inside.

09:33.286 --> 09:35.354
See? They're Da's tools.

09:35.355 --> 09:38.157
We're building a grand house for Lord William,

09:38.158 --> 09:39.558
who's getting married.

09:39.559 --> 09:43.061
My da's building it bigger
than other builders would

09:43.062 --> 09:44.963
because he understands pilaster strips

09:44.964 --> 09:47.366
and counterforts and equilateral arches.

09:47.367 --> 09:49.935
It's like they use at the big cathedral.

09:55.708 --> 09:56.909
Pig!

09:59.078 --> 10:01.380
Martha!

10:05.518 --> 10:08.654
Teach that little bitch to
watch where she's stepping!

10:10.723 --> 10:14.126
And pack up while you're at it.
This house is no longer needed.

10:16.763 --> 10:19.932
Lord William, you hired us for the year, sir.

10:19.933 --> 10:21.500
Well, I got a look at the bride

10:21.501 --> 10:23.101
and she turned my stomach.

10:25.171 --> 10:26.939
I have to pay my workers, sir.

10:26.940 --> 10:29.308
I have to feed my family on what you owe us.

10:30.343 --> 10:32.945
Let go of my horse.

10:32.946 --> 10:35.347
Pay me what you owe me.

10:35.348 --> 10:37.182
Walter!

10:38.518 --> 10:40.185
Back off, builder.

10:40.186 --> 10:42.488
God will see the right of this!

10:42.489 --> 10:45.791
You'll burn for it, My Lord! You will pay in hell!

11:08.815 --> 11:10.015
Yah!

11:13.753 --> 11:15.120
We're safe.

11:30.937 --> 11:32.738
I'm hungry, Ma!

11:32.739 --> 11:34.806
What did I tell you, Martha?

11:34.807 --> 11:38.544
Sing. It'll take your mind off eating.

11:38.545 --> 11:40.412
It's not working.

11:58.698 --> 12:02.501
If you'd stayed at Exeter, you
might have been master builder.

12:02.502 --> 12:04.169
It was a dull job, Agnes.

12:04.170 --> 12:06.638
That castle would have fed us for life.

12:06.639 --> 12:09.508
Now we'll starve, unless you find food for winter.

12:09.509 --> 12:11.009
Don't fret, love.

12:11.010 --> 12:14.179
You'll only have curdled milk left for our babe.

12:14.180 --> 12:15.681
I want a home, Tom!

12:15.682 --> 12:17.783
A roof over our heads, food on the table.

12:21.387 --> 12:23.989
There's a cathedral going up near Wells.

12:23.990 --> 12:25.624
You and your cathedrals!

12:25.625 --> 12:28.794
Why can't you be content with building houses?

12:28.795 --> 12:30.162
Look around you.

12:32.231 --> 12:33.699
We're in a cathedral.

12:33.700 --> 12:37.469
Nave, columns, heavenly light.

12:40.873 --> 12:44.209
No cathedral I've been in looks like this.

12:44.210 --> 12:46.244
That is why I must build one.

12:47.614 --> 12:50.415
Now, with your support, my love,

12:50.416 --> 12:53.619
your skill, Alfred, and God's good grace,

12:53.620 --> 12:56.355
it will be... beautiful.

12:56.356 --> 12:59.658
What about me, Da? What will I do?

12:59.659 --> 13:01.994
You, Martha...

13:03.563 --> 13:06.531
You, will be the, uh...

13:06.532 --> 13:08.734
the master "measurementater".

13:08.735 --> 13:12.871
- The what?
- The master "measurementater"!

13:12.872 --> 13:16.508
- What's that?
- The "measurementater"?

13:16.509 --> 13:19.645
Well, you will decide the height, the width and...

13:19.646 --> 13:21.847
And the chancel and the high altar?

13:21.848 --> 13:23.849
Wherever you decide is where it goes!

13:28.221 --> 13:29.488
Here!

13:29.489 --> 13:31.556
Well, a bit further than that.

13:33.960 --> 13:35.794
- Here!
- Further than that!

13:35.795 --> 13:37.362
Keep going about 3 miles!

13:38.798 --> 13:42.267
At least it's taking her mind off eating.

13:46.172 --> 13:48.206
No! Da!

13:48.207 --> 13:49.975
Stop!

13:49.976 --> 13:51.410
Jack, let's stop him!

13:53.780 --> 13:56.181
- Martha!
- Leave her! Get the pig!

14:13.866 --> 14:15.067
Save the pig!

14:24.877 --> 14:25.877
Get away!

14:29.382 --> 14:30.816
We did it, Da!

14:30.817 --> 14:32.918
We fought 3 of them, didn't we?

14:34.787 --> 14:36.521
Aye, that we did, Son.

14:36.522 --> 14:38.457
She won't live.

14:40.660 --> 14:42.160
She'll be fine.

14:42.161 --> 14:44.730
She'll wake up and be sick
and then she'll be fine.

14:48.701 --> 14:51.303
We'd better get her out of the storm.

14:51.304 --> 14:52.337
Can you carry her?

14:56.175 --> 14:57.676
Be gentle.

14:58.911 --> 15:00.645
Hey, give that here.

15:02.715 --> 15:04.583
Give that here!

15:04.584 --> 15:05.951
Jack...

15:09.088 --> 15:11.223
- Which way?
- Here.

15:27.540 --> 15:30.008
I don't trust them, Ma.

15:30.009 --> 15:32.677
She sounds like a foreigner.

15:48.728 --> 15:50.829
My name is Ellen, by the way.

15:52.799 --> 15:54.399
Tom.

15:54.400 --> 15:55.934
Tom the Builder?

16:06.846 --> 16:08.480
You're an artist, I see.

16:08.481 --> 16:10.115
Jack is, not me.

16:10.116 --> 16:11.249
Your son did these?

16:11.250 --> 16:13.552
He was reading and writing by age 5.

16:13.553 --> 16:17.556
- Who taught him?
- Who do you think?

16:20.126 --> 16:21.159
Who taught you?

16:21.160 --> 16:22.727
My father.

16:24.931 --> 16:28.233
He was a Saxon knight who brought me to England

16:28.234 --> 16:30.001
to improve my education.

16:30.002 --> 16:32.237
He placed me in a convent.

16:32.238 --> 16:34.206
I'm a renegade nun.

16:34.207 --> 16:37.442
Novice, really. I never took vows.

16:37.443 --> 16:39.377
I ran away because...

16:40.947 --> 16:45.050
Well, one day, on a beach, I met Jack's father.

16:55.595 --> 16:58.763
<i>He was a Frenchman who
survived a fire at sea.</i>

16:58.764 --> 17:02.634
I hid him in the cloister's
barn and helped him recover.

17:02.635 --> 17:04.169
Ah...

17:04.170 --> 17:05.837
<i>We fell in love.</i>

17:07.839 --> 17:10.642
They don't allow pregnant nuns in the convent.

17:10.643 --> 17:12.109
No.

17:16.648 --> 17:18.550
Why doesn't he speak? Is he mute?

17:18.550 --> 17:21.653
No. Only to strangers.

17:21.654 --> 17:24.321
When he was young, he saw...

17:25.758 --> 17:27.058
a terrible thing.

17:38.004 --> 17:41.406
Ma, Ma, Ma! Ma, wake up!

17:41.407 --> 17:43.942
Ma, Ma! She's a witch!

17:43.943 --> 17:46.678
You mustn't leave. She needs her rest.

17:46.679 --> 17:49.080
We don't abide with witches.

17:49.081 --> 17:51.283
I'm not a witch! It's medicine.

17:51.284 --> 17:54.185
I used it to cure your daughter.

17:54.186 --> 17:56.454
God help her then. Medicine is sin.

17:57.823 --> 18:00.358
There's work at the bishop's
palace. It needs repair.

18:00.359 --> 18:01.559
It's no cathedral,

18:01.560 --> 18:03.662
but it will see you through winter.

18:03.663 --> 18:04.996
Thank you.

18:17.543 --> 18:20.879
Because I am weary with age and have no male heir,

18:20.880 --> 18:25.283
I've gathered you here to
swear allegiance to my daughter.

18:25.284 --> 18:28.853
The princess Maud and her husband expect a son,

18:29.889 --> 18:31.589
the soothsayers assure me.

18:31.590 --> 18:35.560
I ask you, lords of the land, to pledge before God

18:35.561 --> 18:37.896
that until this son comes of age,

18:37.897 --> 18:40.198
you will recognize Maud as your ruler.

18:40.199 --> 18:42.968
Along with her bastard brother.

18:45.237 --> 18:47.339
Do you swear, my good Gloucester?

18:47.340 --> 18:48.740
I so swear...

18:53.212 --> 18:55.914
I so swear, Uncle.

18:59.652 --> 19:02.587
Lord Stephen! You stepped before me, sir!

19:02.588 --> 19:05.924
The grandson of William the
Conqueror takes precedence

19:05.925 --> 19:07.559
over a bastard.

19:07.560 --> 19:08.893
The king's bastard,

19:08.894 --> 19:11.496
whom he loves as much as the son who drowned.

19:11.497 --> 19:15.133
How fortunate you weren't on that ship, Stephen.

19:15.134 --> 19:17.435
I have no pretensions to the throne.

19:17.436 --> 19:22.407
Ah, but the Church behind you does.

19:34.153 --> 19:36.488
And with you and the Pope in power,

19:36.489 --> 19:38.390
think how the people will suffer!

19:47.299 --> 19:48.400
I'm cold, Da.

19:51.037 --> 19:53.271
Where's the road? Are we lost?

19:53.272 --> 19:54.739
Hush now.

20:04.483 --> 20:06.451
Da...

20:08.020 --> 20:09.554
Agnes!

20:09.555 --> 20:11.022
Agnes!

20:16.695 --> 20:18.430
Alfred! Ma!

20:18.431 --> 20:20.265
You're all right.

20:20.266 --> 20:22.567
You're all right. I've got you.

20:22.568 --> 20:25.070
What do I do, Da? What do I do?

20:25.071 --> 20:26.938
Make a bed. Lay her down.

20:26.939 --> 20:28.673
Right.

20:34.013 --> 20:35.647
Hot water! Where's the girl?

20:36.916 --> 20:40.085
Deep breaths, My Lady. It won't be long.

20:45.224 --> 20:47.692
Short breaths now. My Lady...

20:49.328 --> 20:51.262
Why didn't you say something?

20:53.032 --> 20:54.833
I thought it would stop.

21:44.717 --> 21:46.885
It's a boy.

21:47.887 --> 21:49.521
It's a boy.

22:20.186 --> 22:21.753
You have another son.

22:27.326 --> 22:28.826
Hold me, Tom.

22:29.795 --> 22:30.962
I'm cold.

22:36.635 --> 22:38.503
You're a good man.

22:41.607 --> 22:44.709
You deserve something... beautiful.

22:44.710 --> 22:46.811
I have you.

22:46.812 --> 22:48.313
The cathedral...

22:49.682 --> 22:51.249
build it.

22:55.621 --> 22:56.888
Promise me.

23:04.063 --> 23:06.097
Ma!

23:06.098 --> 23:07.899
Ma!

23:15.874 --> 23:18.376
You sense it, too? Something's wrong.

23:18.377 --> 23:20.245
Go and find them, Jack. Quick.

23:25.651 --> 23:28.886
Here's to my grandson, Henry II of England!

23:30.322 --> 23:32.056
Perhaps I'll live to see him grown.

23:33.492 --> 23:36.227
I may even outlive you, old friend.

23:36.228 --> 23:38.129
Ah!

23:38.130 --> 23:41.165
Lampreys! My favourite!

23:44.570 --> 23:45.603
Mmm!

24:08.827 --> 24:10.762
He's so little.

24:12.898 --> 24:14.332
He came too early.

24:14.333 --> 24:16.801
How are we supposed to feed him?

24:17.836 --> 24:19.237
No, we can't.

24:23.042 --> 24:25.143
No, we can't.

24:26.779 --> 24:28.780
Alfred, will you take your sister?

24:28.781 --> 24:30.415
I'll join you shortly.

24:30.416 --> 24:32.650
But you can't leave him, Da.

24:32.651 --> 24:34.585
It's God's will.

24:34.586 --> 24:37.288
He won't starve.

24:37.289 --> 24:40.458
He'll just fall asleep, and his ma will take him.

24:43.529 --> 24:45.830
You run along. I'll be with you soon.

24:55.507 --> 24:57.141
Go.

25:09.355 --> 25:10.822
God keep you, Son.

25:10.823 --> 25:12.757
You sleep with your ma.

25:54.133 --> 25:56.200
What's wrong with him?

25:56.201 --> 25:58.469
- Get the physician!
- Hurry!

26:05.377 --> 26:07.945
Lord Gloucester!

26:07.946 --> 26:09.981
Make way!

26:17.356 --> 26:19.190
The king is dying, Your Eminence.

26:19.191 --> 26:20.825
As Archbishop of Canterbury,

26:20.826 --> 26:23.428
you alone can crown the next king.

26:23.429 --> 26:28.366
You will favour the Church in all your dealings.

26:32.871 --> 26:35.339
I'll give you whatever you want.

27:13.445 --> 27:15.480
Stay here. I...

27:16.748 --> 27:18.683
I... I can't...

27:18.684 --> 27:19.951
I can't leave him. Da?

27:27.726 --> 27:29.327
The king is dead.

27:37.302 --> 27:38.803
Oh!

27:41.273 --> 27:43.174
Long live the king.

28:26.351 --> 28:27.718
Look at him.

28:27.719 --> 28:32.123
After 18 years, he still hasn't helped us.

28:32.124 --> 28:34.892
He promised! I want a title.

28:36.261 --> 28:38.062
Our son deserves a title.

28:38.063 --> 28:39.630
When Waleran becomes bishop,

28:39.631 --> 28:41.666
he'll have more power, and so will we.

28:41.667 --> 28:43.000
If he's bishop.

28:43.001 --> 28:46.337
I'm beginning to lose faith in that fellow.

29:02.554 --> 29:04.522
Stephen has the support of the Church

29:04.523 --> 29:07.592
and the backing of any who
fear being ruled by a woman.

29:07.593 --> 29:09.994
Which is most of the men in this country.

29:09.995 --> 29:12.797
He's only king because your brother was drowned.

29:12.798 --> 29:14.332
An unfortunate accident.

29:14.333 --> 29:17.301
Unfortunate, yes. But an accident?

29:17.302 --> 29:19.170
Not, I think, an accident.

29:19.171 --> 29:22.206
Stephen has broken his oath to you, Sister.

29:22.207 --> 29:24.709
When kings die, oaths die with them.

29:24.710 --> 29:28.012
Except, perhaps, here, at Shiring Castle.

29:29.715 --> 29:31.148
I loved your father.

29:32.751 --> 29:35.953
He had my complete support.

29:37.155 --> 29:39.624
And so, therefore, do you.

29:39.625 --> 29:40.925
You have my word.

29:42.127 --> 29:44.795
As do you, Gloucester.

29:44.796 --> 29:48.332
I knew we would, Bartholomew.

29:48.333 --> 29:52.370
We'll raise an army together
and take Stephen by surprise.

29:52.371 --> 29:56.974
And if he thinks he's fighting
a spoiled princess, he's wrong.

29:56.975 --> 29:59.644
I'm now a mother defending her son.

29:59.645 --> 30:02.279
And her rightful realm.

30:07.986 --> 30:09.620
Brother Francis...

30:10.856 --> 30:13.057
Praise God! It's good to see you!

30:17.462 --> 30:18.863
Philip!

30:20.032 --> 30:21.866
It's been too long. You're well?

30:21.867 --> 30:25.469
The monastery's well, which
keeps me busy and happy. You?

30:25.470 --> 30:26.437
Well enough.

30:26.438 --> 30:28.305
I'm Lord Gloucester's secretary.

30:28.306 --> 30:29.740
I heard, I heard!

30:29.741 --> 30:33.310
Our mother and father would
be very proud, dear Brother.

30:33.311 --> 30:36.647
I need a favour, Philip,
which is why I sent for you.

30:36.648 --> 30:40.051
A new king has been crowned.

30:40.052 --> 30:41.619
King Stephen, yes.

30:41.620 --> 30:45.256
Opposed to him is Maud, King Henry's daughter.

30:45.257 --> 30:47.892
A woman cannot take the throne.

30:47.893 --> 30:52.530
Maud, supported by Gloucester
and Earl Bartholomew,

30:52.531 --> 30:56.033
is secretly raising an army against Stephen

30:56.034 --> 30:57.668
to regain the throne.

30:59.104 --> 31:02.239
Stephen must know of their treachery.

31:02.240 --> 31:06.444
But if word came from me,
Gloucester would have me hanged.

31:10.348 --> 31:12.316
You're asking me to do this?

31:12.317 --> 31:14.051
I'd never get an audience.

31:14.052 --> 31:15.820
Your bishop would.

31:15.821 --> 31:19.657
If Maud wins, the Church will be the loser.

31:19.658 --> 31:22.026
Politically, we must back Stephen.

31:22.027 --> 31:25.096
But I don't believe in politics, Francis.

31:25.097 --> 31:27.465
I believe in the will of God.

31:27.466 --> 31:29.800
It's the Church's will, Philip.

31:29.801 --> 31:32.937
Second to God, remember?

31:45.784 --> 31:48.853
Matthew Farmer: 2 pigs.

31:52.624 --> 31:55.526
Widow John: 3 dozen eggs.

31:58.063 --> 32:00.698
Michael Miller: a stone of wheat.

32:06.872 --> 32:08.739
It certainly needs repair.

32:08.740 --> 32:10.141
If they have money.

32:10.142 --> 32:12.710
It's a bishop's palace, Tom Builder.

32:12.711 --> 32:14.845
There's always money.

32:14.846 --> 32:16.313
Ellen!

32:18.116 --> 32:21.118
Five jars of honey.

32:25.323 --> 32:26.690
How are you, Martha?

32:26.691 --> 32:28.926
Ma died.

32:29.928 --> 32:31.028
I'm sorry.

32:37.536 --> 32:39.069
I've come to see the bishop.

32:39.070 --> 32:41.739
The sentry said he's away and
I'm to speak to his assistant.

32:42.774 --> 32:44.275
Please.

32:51.750 --> 32:53.517
Who are you?

32:53.518 --> 32:55.019
I'm Philip, Father.

32:55.020 --> 32:57.988
I come from the monastery
of St.-John-in-the-Forest.

32:57.989 --> 33:01.525
Philip of Gwynedd, the
Welshman that turned a monastery

33:01.526 --> 33:04.495
of lazy monks into a pious, successful business.

33:04.496 --> 33:06.964
I merely put things in order, Father.

33:06.965 --> 33:09.333
And who are you?

33:09.334 --> 33:12.436
I'm Father Waleran Bigod.

33:14.606 --> 33:16.207
How can I help you?

33:16.208 --> 33:18.209
I have a message of a private nature

33:18.210 --> 33:19.643
to convey to His Eminence.

33:20.946 --> 33:23.180
I have the bishop's confidence.

33:23.181 --> 33:24.882
Take a seat.

33:26.418 --> 33:27.384
Thank you.

33:38.330 --> 33:40.898
When will the bishop be returning?

33:40.899 --> 33:43.367
The news is quite sensitive.

33:43.368 --> 33:45.202
You can trust me, Philip.

33:48.006 --> 33:49.139
To be blunt,

33:49.140 --> 33:51.842
the bishop has never been the most attentive man

33:51.843 --> 33:53.711
to affairs of church and state.

33:53.712 --> 33:57.014
That's why the Archbishop
of Canterbury sent me here.

33:57.015 --> 33:58.782
You trust him, don't you?

33:58.783 --> 34:00.317
Yes, of course.

34:05.724 --> 34:07.191
Three days ago,

34:07.192 --> 34:10.427
um, a gravely ill soldier came to my monastery

34:10.428 --> 34:13.530
and he had a secret that he wished to tell

34:13.531 --> 34:14.665
before he died.

34:14.666 --> 34:17.668
His master, Bartholomew, Earl of Shiring,

34:17.668 --> 34:20.536
is conspiring with Robert of Gloucester

34:20.538 --> 34:23.607
to raise a rebellion against the new king.

34:26.478 --> 34:28.478
Was he telling the truth?

34:28.480 --> 34:30.313
He was a dying man.

34:30.315 --> 34:32.248
Who else knows this?

34:32.250 --> 34:33.951
No one.

34:35.487 --> 34:37.487
See that it remains that way.

34:40.091 --> 34:41.659
Do you go directly home?

34:41.659 --> 34:44.795
Yes, by way of Kingsbridge.
Prior James there is ill.

34:44.795 --> 34:46.864
I heard that. How do you know him?

34:46.864 --> 34:48.632
He raised my brother and I

34:48.632 --> 34:51.101
after we were made orphans in the latest war.

34:51.101 --> 34:53.370
He was sent to Kingsbridge 20 years ago.

34:53.371 --> 34:56.005
And after he was made prior, we followed.

34:58.710 --> 35:01.512
Father, is there something wrong?

35:01.513 --> 35:04.214
I'll see the bishop gets the message.

35:04.215 --> 35:06.250
Good day to you, Philip of Gwynedd.

35:06.251 --> 35:07.985
Good day.

35:13.158 --> 35:14.458
Father?

35:14.459 --> 35:16.694
Those people out there, send them away.

35:16.695 --> 35:19.563
They're not to spend the
night within a mile of here.

35:19.564 --> 35:21.065
Yes, Father.

35:21.066 --> 35:22.933
<i>Why turn us away?</i>

35:22.934 --> 35:24.601
They have plenty of work and money.

35:27.205 --> 35:29.807
Now we're facing a long winter. What now?

35:29.808 --> 35:31.275
Here you are, Martha.

35:32.310 --> 35:34.211
Alfred...

35:39.517 --> 35:40.851
Why are you here?

35:43.755 --> 35:47.057
Because Jack needs a master
builder to apprentice him.

35:47.058 --> 35:48.559
He's practically mute.

35:48.560 --> 35:50.761
But he's not stupid. Give him a voice.

35:52.030 --> 35:53.697
We won't be a burden. I promise.

35:53.698 --> 35:54.732
We?

35:54.733 --> 35:56.400
I'll travel with you.

35:56.401 --> 35:58.802
I'll help you find work and food.

35:58.803 --> 36:01.372
And I'll nurse Martha back to health.

36:03.708 --> 36:05.109
We're not married.

36:06.478 --> 36:07.811
People will talk.

36:07.812 --> 36:09.346
And who will tell them?

36:10.815 --> 36:14.051
Our hearts are pure, Tom Builder.

36:28.233 --> 36:30.634
God, protect me from her!

36:39.644 --> 36:41.945
Prior James, I've come back.

36:56.961 --> 36:59.463
Tell me, who's that fellow with the baby?

36:59.464 --> 37:00.831
Johnny Eightpence.

37:00.832 --> 37:03.233
He's the newest addition to our community.

37:03.234 --> 37:06.070
He found the baby on a grave and brought him here,

37:06.071 --> 37:08.539
and now he's turned from thief to wet nurse.

37:15.146 --> 37:16.847
Well, how can we be in debt?

37:16.848 --> 37:18.782
The priory has more land than ever.

37:18.783 --> 37:21.652
As well as bad tenants, lazy monks, poor finances

37:21.653 --> 37:24.521
and a church in such disrepair
the pilgrims won't visit.

37:24.522 --> 37:27.257
People come here to be
awestruck by the majesty of God.

37:27.258 --> 37:29.793
Brother Remigius couldn't care less.

37:29.794 --> 37:31.628
Then why elect him prior?

37:31.629 --> 37:33.831
Who will run against him?

37:33.832 --> 37:37.401
Well, there is one candidate
who could turn this place around,

37:37.402 --> 37:38.769
but I doubt he'd accept.

37:38.770 --> 37:39.803
Who's that?

37:41.139 --> 37:42.606
You.

37:42.607 --> 37:44.374
You grew up in a priory.

37:44.375 --> 37:47.244
You've been running a small monastery for 3 years

37:47.245 --> 37:48.745
and completely reformed it.

37:48.746 --> 37:52.583
It's clear to everyone, the hand of God is on you.

37:55.553 --> 37:57.588
A proud monk is a bad monk.

37:57.589 --> 37:59.857
And pride is my chief temptation.

37:59.858 --> 38:02.392
Then let me tempt you.

38:18.743 --> 38:21.411
Prior James mentioned something about a shipwreck.

38:23.114 --> 38:24.248
A survivor.

38:24.249 --> 38:25.849
No names?

38:25.850 --> 38:27.217
No.

38:31.422 --> 38:33.624
A delirium of death.

38:35.160 --> 38:38.662
You were a great comfort
to him, I'm certain of that.

38:38.663 --> 38:40.130
You're a good man.

38:41.332 --> 38:43.967
The most intelligent young priest

38:43.968 --> 38:45.235
in the diocese,

38:45.236 --> 38:46.670
from what I hear.

38:47.839 --> 38:50.274
Are you ambitious?

38:50.275 --> 38:53.177
To do something meaningful with my life, yes.

38:53.178 --> 38:54.545
So what's the plan?

38:54.546 --> 38:56.513
You wish to, what? Become a bishop?

38:56.514 --> 38:59.550
That would work against everything I believe in.

38:59.551 --> 39:01.552
- Which is?
- Purifying...

39:01.553 --> 39:04.321
sanctifying God's community on Earth.

39:05.490 --> 39:07.624
So becoming Prior of Kingsbridge

39:07.625 --> 39:09.826
would satisfy your ambition?

39:10.929 --> 39:12.729
Well, be direct, Philip.

39:12.730 --> 39:15.532
As the bishop's representative,
I can sway the election.

39:15.533 --> 39:18.235
If that's what you want from me, say so.

39:23.107 --> 39:24.741
Yes.

39:24.742 --> 39:25.976
Good, good.

39:27.478 --> 39:30.247
But politics is a bargain between beggars.

39:30.248 --> 39:32.182
When the bishop dies here,

39:32.183 --> 39:34.451
the monks here elect the new one.

39:39.090 --> 39:41.892
So if you make me prior,

39:41.893 --> 39:45.362
I, when the time comes, make you bishop?

40:12.123 --> 40:15.025
You knew I would have made the same promise.

40:15.026 --> 40:17.027
You owe me this, Father.

40:18.529 --> 40:21.098
I don't like being told I owe anybody anything.

40:21.099 --> 40:24.501
Since we're being blunt, Philip
is the better man for the job.

40:24.502 --> 40:26.236
He's one of those rare priests

40:26.237 --> 40:28.238
who actually believes what he preaches.

40:28.239 --> 40:30.140
I admire that.

40:30.141 --> 40:31.475
Besides...

40:32.844 --> 40:36.246
you owe me, Remigius, remember?

40:37.382 --> 40:39.449
Sodomy! Huh!

40:39.450 --> 40:41.752
An excommunicable offense.

40:43.554 --> 40:45.188
And as your confessor,

40:45.189 --> 40:48.158
I hold your eternal salvation behind sealed lips.

40:48.159 --> 40:49.860
Here's what I want you to do.

40:49.861 --> 40:52.963
Philip is idealistic, which
is generally commendable,

40:52.964 --> 40:54.431
but occasionally awkward.

40:54.432 --> 40:57.467
You will be my eyes and
ears and tell me everything.

41:20.458 --> 41:24.361
On this day, as harvest
ends and winter approaches,

41:24.362 --> 41:26.596
there's reason to celebrate, as well as mourn.

41:28.066 --> 41:31.702
Philip of Gwynedd has been elected

41:31.703 --> 41:33.837
our new Prior of Kingsbridge

41:33.838 --> 41:36.873
to replace the late Prior James.

41:36.874 --> 41:40.277
May St. Adolphus, whose
relic sanctifies this church,

41:40.278 --> 41:41.478
help guide him.

41:43.815 --> 41:46.149
At the same time, sadness descends.

41:47.685 --> 41:49.152
Our good bishop,

41:49.153 --> 41:51.755
<i>who led his flock for so long,</i>

41:51.756 --> 41:55.058
died quite suddenly while
saying mass Saturday last.

42:04.602 --> 42:08.705
The monks will now choose a successor.

42:10.308 --> 42:12.409
And Prior Philip, with God's help,

42:12.410 --> 42:13.877
will show them the way.

42:23.454 --> 42:26.490
Such a shame about William and Aliena.

42:26.491 --> 42:28.325
What man thinks best, God knows better.

42:28.326 --> 42:31.294
Your patience has paid off, Lord Bishop.

42:31.295 --> 42:33.029
I'm not bishop yet.

42:33.030 --> 42:35.065
We're still waiting for our title.

42:35.066 --> 42:37.033
You gave us your word!

42:37.034 --> 42:38.535
Did I?

42:39.771 --> 42:43.106
I fear you misremember, Percy, but not to worry.

42:43.107 --> 42:45.308
I have interesting news for you.

42:45.309 --> 42:48.578
Bartholomew has sided with
Maud against King Stephen.

42:48.579 --> 42:51.314
- Bartholomew's turned traitor?
- Shhh!

42:51.315 --> 42:53.550
You may win that title yet.

42:56.053 --> 42:58.488
Excellent! We'll arrest Bartholomew

42:58.489 --> 43:00.657
and the king will give us Shiring.

43:00.658 --> 43:02.859
You can have a title without a wife.

43:02.860 --> 43:04.594
Do shut up, Father.

43:04.595 --> 43:08.064
And Bartholomew will deny the
plot, and you'll be hanged.

43:08.065 --> 43:10.300
I hadn't thought of that.

43:10.301 --> 43:13.136
He's setting us up to test the waters, Percy.

43:13.137 --> 43:15.639
If we sink in the mud, he stays immaculate.

43:15.640 --> 43:16.807
So what do we do?

43:16.808 --> 43:18.875
Well, we must first find proof.

43:18.876 --> 43:22.212
We'll follow anyone suspicious leaving the castle

43:22.213 --> 43:23.513
and encourage them to talk.

43:23.514 --> 43:24.648
With whose money?

43:24.649 --> 43:25.615
My dear,

43:25.616 --> 43:28.919
you don't need money to loosen tongues.

43:28.920 --> 43:30.520
Do you, William?

43:48.105 --> 43:49.906
Quick as you can!

43:51.342 --> 43:53.310
Take them inside!

43:57.381 --> 43:58.882
- Are you Matthew?
- Yes.

43:58.883 --> 44:01.785
I'm a mason, and these are my apprentices.

44:01.786 --> 44:04.187
We come looking for work. I'm sorry.

44:04.188 --> 44:06.556
I could work at the quarry.

44:06.557 --> 44:08.091
We don't need quarrymen.

44:08.092 --> 44:12.262
I hope you're not planning on doing battle soon.

44:12.263 --> 44:14.064
Why do you say that?

44:16.868 --> 44:19.669
All the mortar on your keep gate is crumbling.

44:19.670 --> 44:22.172
It'd just take a crowbar to bring that down.

44:22.173 --> 44:24.641
A keep has an undercroft with a wooden door.

44:24.642 --> 44:26.977
If I were attacking, I'd t light to it.

44:26.978 --> 44:29.713
If you were earl, how would you prevent it?

44:29.714 --> 44:31.281
Well, I'd hire a mason.

44:31.282 --> 44:34.951
I'd have him standing by with
stones to block up that doorway

44:34.952 --> 44:36.720
in case of trouble.

44:36.721 --> 44:38.321
Hire this man!

44:38.322 --> 44:40.390
See that he's housed and fed.

44:42.026 --> 44:43.593
Where's my sword?

44:43.594 --> 44:46.429
Come on, quickly now!

44:46.430 --> 44:47.831
Yeah?

44:47.832 --> 44:49.833
A message from the Earl of Gloucester

44:49.834 --> 44:51.301
and the princess, sire.

44:51.302 --> 44:53.737
He will take my answer back to Maud.

45:03.981 --> 45:05.415
Ah!

45:10.788 --> 45:12.856
Here, take it. It's all I have.

45:12.857 --> 45:14.424
It's not money we want.

45:15.893 --> 45:20.430
This man has confessed that
Bartholomew, Earl of Shiring,

45:20.431 --> 45:24.301
is conspiring with Richard of
Gloucester and Princess Maud,

45:24.302 --> 45:26.403
to raise arms against the king.

45:26.404 --> 45:29.205
Maud is going to France to gather troops.

45:29.206 --> 45:31.241
We must defend the king!

45:31.242 --> 45:35.312
We will loot Shiring Castle, slaughter the men

45:35.313 --> 45:39.182
and show the women what
true soldiers are capable of!

45:39.183 --> 45:41.251
Saddle my horse.

45:41.252 --> 45:43.653
Bring me an escort. I'm going to the king.

45:43.654 --> 45:46.623
This gate needs an arch to make it stronger.

45:46.624 --> 45:50.226
An arch distributes the
weight evenly into 2 supports,

45:50.227 --> 45:51.661
then into the ground.

45:51.662 --> 45:52.662
You understand?

45:54.665 --> 45:55.899
Never mind.

45:55.900 --> 45:57.934
What I need from the quarry

45:57.935 --> 46:01.304
is stones to match these ones already in place.

46:01.305 --> 46:04.708
Knock out the loose ones. If
they're whole, remortar them.

46:04.709 --> 46:07.911
If they're cracked, leave
them in piles every 10 feet.

46:07.912 --> 46:10.213
You heard him! Let's get to work!

46:18.689 --> 46:20.657
Try some of that there.

46:34.105 --> 46:36.239
He's witched you, that's all.

46:36.240 --> 46:37.874
Just like his ma.

46:37.875 --> 46:39.609
Don't be a bloody fool.

46:55.493 --> 46:57.494
Aliena!

47:08.906 --> 47:12.275
- Who is that?
- The earl's daughter.

47:12.276 --> 47:14.344
I met her last night after supper.

47:14.345 --> 47:15.812
Her mother's dead, too.

47:15.813 --> 47:17.781
Hello, Martha. You're up early.

47:17.782 --> 47:20.417
Da makes me work. Alfred, too.

47:20.418 --> 47:22.252
He's my brother.

47:22.253 --> 47:23.286
Hello.

47:23.287 --> 47:26.456
Uh, milady, an honor.

47:26.457 --> 47:27.490
Thank you.

47:28.959 --> 47:31.061
And this is?

47:31.062 --> 47:33.296
That's Jack. He doesn't talk much.

47:33.297 --> 47:35.699
But look, he made a likeness of me.

47:35.700 --> 47:38.334
It's remarkable. Your brother's quite gifted.

47:38.335 --> 47:41.504
Oh, he's not my brother. Jack's a bastard.

47:47.378 --> 47:49.245
Lunch, everyone!

47:49.246 --> 47:51.181
He's a gifted bastard.

48:23.948 --> 48:26.583
Come to court again, Lord William?

48:26.584 --> 48:28.051
As a matter of fact I have.

48:28.052 --> 48:29.953
Only this time, I'm courting you.

49:08.592 --> 49:10.827
Oh, here you are.

49:10.828 --> 49:12.428
Are you coming?

49:23.007 --> 49:24.340
Jack! Quick!

49:25.876 --> 49:27.777
We are under attack!

49:53.704 --> 49:55.104
Your Majesty!

49:55.105 --> 49:57.407
Your Majesty!

49:58.676 --> 50:00.310
I have urgent news.

50:09.053 --> 50:11.354
Get inside, everyone!

51:32.603 --> 51:34.504
They must be somewhere.

51:39.343 --> 51:40.743
Aliena!

51:55.159 --> 51:56.292
Percy!

52:02.766 --> 52:03.800
Get up!

52:13.477 --> 52:14.644
Da!

52:16.280 --> 52:17.613
No!

52:35.632 --> 52:38.067
Surrender, traitor!

52:38.068 --> 52:39.736
I'd rather die for Maud.

52:39.737 --> 52:43.239
Then so will every man,
woman and child in this keep!

52:48.812 --> 52:51.214
Halt! Halt! Hear me out!

52:51.215 --> 52:53.182
Halt! Halt!

52:53.183 --> 52:56.419
Stop the fighting, in Lord Percy's name!

52:56.420 --> 52:58.054
Spare my people.

52:58.055 --> 53:01.190
Stephen knows you covet my title.

53:01.191 --> 53:04.827
He may, therefore, doubt my guilt.

53:04.828 --> 53:06.629
If you spare my people...

53:08.866 --> 53:11.701
I will confess guilt to his face.

53:17.941 --> 53:20.610
Thank you, Earl of Shiring.

53:23.380 --> 53:25.982
Maud's fleeing to France with her precious son.

53:25.983 --> 53:27.717
Stop them!

53:27.718 --> 53:31.287
Bring them here. I want
that child dead at my feet!

53:34.391 --> 53:37.060
The ship's ready to sail, Your Majesty.

53:37.061 --> 53:39.562
The messenger should have returned by now.

53:39.563 --> 53:41.230
We can't wait longer, Sister.

53:41.231 --> 53:45.001
We must to sail to France
where your son will be safe.

53:54.645 --> 53:55.912
Da!

53:55.913 --> 53:58.581
It's no use calling. I saw him fall.

54:01.251 --> 54:03.786
It'll take more than that to kill me.

54:03.787 --> 54:04.987
Da!

54:10.661 --> 54:12.595
Had you scared, did I?

54:12.596 --> 54:14.030
Tom!

54:18.168 --> 54:20.603
We have to leave here as quick as we can.

54:20.604 --> 54:23.840
A worker said there's a new prior at Kingsbridge.

54:23.841 --> 54:25.141
New priors have work.

54:25.142 --> 54:27.110
The Kingsbridge prior's dead?

54:27.111 --> 54:28.578
So they say.

54:28.579 --> 54:30.546
Good. May the Devil take his soul.

54:30.547 --> 54:33.182
- You knew him?
- Yes, I met him once. Come.

54:35.752 --> 54:37.520
Don't fuss.

54:37.521 --> 54:39.989
You're getting soppy, aren't you?
