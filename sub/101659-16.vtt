WEBVTT

00:01.668 --> 00:03.503
[monitor beeping]

00:04.379 --> 00:05.964
You said the pain was intense?

00:06.047 --> 00:07.924
Yeah, it was sharp on both sides.

00:08.008 --> 00:10.218
And it didn't last long?

00:10.301 --> 00:12.053
Just a few minutes.

00:12.137 --> 00:14.514
And nothing in the 24 hours since then?

00:14.597 --> 00:17.642
Mm-mm. My O.B. said it was
probably round ligament pain.

00:17.726 --> 00:19.602
Yeah, that's basically growing pains.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.647
Your uterus is expanding.
So do your ligaments.

00:22.731 --> 00:25.442
Normal fetal heart rate and movement.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.318
Your B.P. is perfect.

00:27.402 --> 00:29.154
Everything seems normal.

00:29.237 --> 00:32.741
Complications and miscarriage
are also normal.

00:32.824 --> 00:34.993
Lea's O.B. did not consider
every possibility.

00:35.076 --> 00:36.578
Which is why we're here.

00:36.661 --> 00:37.579
Shaun made a list.

00:37.662 --> 00:39.330
I'm pretty sure
he's not going to sleep

00:39.414 --> 00:41.541
until every possibility is ruled out.

00:41.624 --> 00:43.835
I categorized every medical complication

00:43.918 --> 00:46.171
that could negatively
impact Lea or the baby

00:46.254 --> 00:48.131
and sorted by Case Fatality Risk.

00:51.092 --> 00:53.094
I'll get started on the tests.

00:53.803 --> 00:56.765
Shortness of breath, pulse ox
and respiratory rate are dropping.

00:56.848 --> 00:57.849
She needs oxygen.

00:57.932 --> 00:59.434
Maxine Stanley, 87 years young.

00:59.517 --> 01:02.103
She passed out on the dance floor
at a cocktail fundraiser

01:02.187 --> 01:04.647
-for the Art Deco Society.
-[gasping for breath]

01:04.731 --> 01:07.108
Art-- Art Nouveau.

01:07.192 --> 01:08.151
Oh!

01:08.234 --> 01:09.861
[monitor alarm beeping]

01:09.944 --> 01:11.071
She's in v-fib.

01:11.154 --> 01:12.363
Getting the crash cart.

01:12.447 --> 01:13.865
No, look at her bracelet.

01:13.948 --> 01:15.533
The vintage Lalique? It's stunning.

01:15.617 --> 01:17.202
Other wrist. Her medical bracelet.

01:17.285 --> 01:18.495
She signed a DNR.

01:20.080 --> 01:22.290
If we don't do anything,
she's gonna go asystolic.

01:22.373 --> 01:23.416
I know.

01:23.500 --> 01:24.793
-But can't we just--
-No.

01:26.252 --> 01:27.086
Epinephrine?

01:27.170 --> 01:29.881
It doesn't qualify
as extraordinary lifesaving measures.

01:29.964 --> 01:31.424
She has a DNR for a reason.

01:31.508 --> 01:33.343
[alarm continues]

01:35.261 --> 01:37.096
[flatlining]

01:45.814 --> 01:47.148
Time of death, two twe--

01:47.232 --> 01:49.067
[monitor beeping]

01:51.319 --> 01:53.822
She still has no heartbeat,
but her pressure is rising.

01:53.905 --> 01:56.324
-Could the machines be screwing up?
-All of them?

01:57.075 --> 01:59.369
Her oxygen levels are climbing to over 90.

02:00.036 --> 02:02.247
I'm hearing blood flow.

02:02.330 --> 02:03.832
[gasps]

02:06.292 --> 02:07.335
Oh.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.004
I'm alive?

02:13.967 --> 02:16.970
Which one of you bozos did this?

02:17.428 --> 02:19.055
[Maxine sighs]

02:20.223 --> 02:22.225
[theme music playing]

02:29.607 --> 02:31.025
[knock on door]

02:34.821 --> 02:36.698
Debbie asked me
to bring this for the baby.

02:36.781 --> 02:39.701
Stuffed toys aren't safe
for infants under 12 months old.

02:39.784 --> 02:41.870
They increase the risk of suffocation.

02:43.121 --> 02:44.831
I'll tell her you said thank you.

02:44.914 --> 02:46.749
You should be at work.

02:46.833 --> 02:47.876
Yeah.

02:47.959 --> 02:49.711
But you're not.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.921
So you must be here for a reason.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.257
Claire must have called you.

02:54.340 --> 02:55.550
She's worried about Lea.

02:55.633 --> 02:57.427
You got some of that right.

02:57.510 --> 02:59.846
Except that Lea is fine.

03:00.305 --> 03:01.389
You're not.

03:02.557 --> 03:04.017
Shaun, you gotta relax.

03:04.100 --> 03:06.811
N-No one expecting a baby should relax.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.980
There are many things
that could go wrong.

03:09.063 --> 03:12.025
Okay, so after the baby's born,
then you can relax?

03:12.108 --> 03:13.192
N-No.

03:13.276 --> 03:17.030
The baby will be helpless,
need us for everything.

03:17.113 --> 03:19.824
So, once the baby learns
how to feed itself and dress itself,

03:19.908 --> 03:21.451
-then you can relax?
-No.

03:21.534 --> 03:24.370
Is my point becoming at all obvious?

03:24.454 --> 03:27.498
That I'm never going to relax ever again?

03:28.541 --> 03:29.959
Kinda, yeah.

03:31.461 --> 03:35.006
Shaun, this should be the most
amazing moment of your life.

03:35.089 --> 03:36.883
Every parent'll tell you the same thing.

03:36.966 --> 03:39.636
If you blink, you're gonna miss it,
and you're blinking.

03:39.719 --> 03:41.930
You're-- You're-- You're
nervous and you're scared

03:42.013 --> 03:44.182
when you s-should be excited.

03:48.811 --> 03:50.605
No signs of preterm labor,

03:50.688 --> 03:53.900
and tests on your liver
ruled out obstetric cholestatis,

03:53.983 --> 03:56.444
and it's not twin-twin transfusion,

03:56.527 --> 03:59.572
because you're officially
not having twins. [chuckles]

03:59.656 --> 04:03.826
Turns out having a baby
with a medical genius has a downside.

04:03.910 --> 04:05.370
But if there is a problem,

04:05.453 --> 04:07.455
I'd rather be here than anywhere else.

04:07.538 --> 04:09.374
Gotta take care of this little girl.

04:10.375 --> 04:11.709
Is the transducer secure?

04:11.793 --> 04:13.294
I just checked it. Why?

04:13.378 --> 04:15.797
Baby's heart rate is mildly bradycardic.

04:17.548 --> 04:19.801
Um, heart rate fluctuates with activity,

04:19.884 --> 04:22.011
and you've been off your feet for a while.

04:23.846 --> 04:26.849
But if Shaun were here,
he would check a transvaginal ultrasound.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.351
Let's get it set up.

04:33.356 --> 04:34.357
Good news.

04:34.440 --> 04:36.192
The arrhythmia didn't
do a lot of damage--

04:36.276 --> 04:37.735
Three things I can't tolerate,

04:37.819 --> 04:40.154
lactose, cargo pants,

04:40.238 --> 04:42.407
and my wishes being ignored.

04:42.490 --> 04:45.451
Mrs. Stanley, I can assure you,
we did not disregard your DNR.

04:45.535 --> 04:47.745
-Then who did?
-It wasn't a "who."

04:47.829 --> 04:50.123
You were treated for lung cancer recently?

04:50.206 --> 04:51.958
Didn't work. [scoffs]

04:52.041 --> 04:55.253
All chemo did was make me
puke up any decent meal I ate.

04:55.336 --> 04:57.588
You also had a lobectomy
to remove the tumors.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.173
They implanted a cardiac device.

04:59.257 --> 05:00.383
A pacemaker.

05:00.466 --> 05:02.218
So I wouldn't die on the table.

05:02.302 --> 05:03.678
It's not a pacemaker.

05:03.761 --> 05:06.264
It's basically a miniature pump
inside your heart,

05:06.347 --> 05:08.641
and if your heart stops, it takes over.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.562
Can you turn it off?

05:15.857 --> 05:16.899
[sighs]

05:16.983 --> 05:18.401
Then take it out.

05:21.904 --> 05:23.740
Mm, I love it.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.950
It's too big for an infant to swallow,

05:26.034 --> 05:28.328
which means it's only
moderately hazardous.

05:28.411 --> 05:30.079
Most good things in life are.

05:30.163 --> 05:31.748
Someday we'll tell our daughter

05:31.831 --> 05:34.959
how Dr. Ted and Dr. Dad
both kept her safe.

05:37.628 --> 05:38.629
[knocks on door]

05:40.798 --> 05:42.925
We have found something.

05:44.761 --> 05:47.722
You have Type 2 vasa previa.

05:47.805 --> 05:50.808
It's when the fetal blood vessels
run across the cervix,

05:50.892 --> 05:52.643
making them extremely vulnerable.

05:52.727 --> 05:54.520
[inhales deeply]

05:54.604 --> 05:56.981
Now, they could rupture at any time,

05:57.065 --> 05:58.775
definitely when your water breaks,

05:58.858 --> 06:00.985
but also under other added stress.

06:01.611 --> 06:04.363
And if that were to happen,
how bad would it be?

06:05.656 --> 06:06.657
[Shaun] We…

06:08.367 --> 06:10.203
would lose the baby.

06:21.005 --> 06:24.717
There's a small, secondary placental lobe
and multiple vessels at risk.

06:24.801 --> 06:25.885
Gestational age?

06:25.968 --> 06:28.346
22 weeks. Two weeks short of viability.

06:28.429 --> 06:29.722
C-section is not an option.

06:31.516 --> 06:33.851
I suggest fetoscopic laser ablation

06:33.935 --> 06:36.521
to stabilize the vessels
and avoid fetal exsanguination.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.564
It's very risky,
but has the highest potential

06:38.648 --> 06:40.191
to avoid elective prematurity.

06:40.274 --> 06:42.110
I wrote a preliminary surgical plan.

06:42.193 --> 06:43.486
Should we review it?

06:43.569 --> 06:45.613
-Well, I'm familiar with the procedure.
-Good.

06:45.696 --> 06:48.991
Since you're the head of surgery,
you can take the lead.

06:49.075 --> 06:49.909
I will assist.

06:49.992 --> 06:51.577
And Claire showed excellent judgment

06:51.661 --> 06:54.205
ordering the ultrasound,
so I would like her to join us.

06:54.288 --> 06:57.667
Also, Jordan has
a calming bedside manner.

06:57.750 --> 06:59.001
This is a good team.

06:59.085 --> 07:00.711
I don't disagree.

07:01.587 --> 07:03.256
Except you can't be on it.

07:04.882 --> 07:06.968
Y-Yes, I can.

07:07.051 --> 07:08.761
I reviewed the rules.

07:08.845 --> 07:10.388
It is a conflict of interest

07:10.471 --> 07:12.807
for doctors to operate on family members.

07:12.890 --> 07:15.685
Lea and I are not married,
so, mm-- is no conflict.

07:15.768 --> 07:18.271
Shaun, Lea is carrying your child.

07:18.354 --> 07:20.356
We aren't operating on the child.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.024
You're citing technicalities.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.276
I am citing the rules.

07:23.359 --> 07:24.944
And why are those rules in place?

07:25.027 --> 07:27.321
So that people with emotional conflicts
don't get--

07:27.405 --> 07:30.283
Then the rule should have said that.
It doesn't. It just says--

07:30.366 --> 07:31.200
Shaun.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.952
I care about you and Lea too much

07:33.035 --> 07:36.080
to put your baby's life
at risk just to make you feel useful.

07:43.421 --> 07:45.339
You are the president of the hospital.

07:45.423 --> 07:46.716
You can overrule Dr. Lim.

07:46.799 --> 07:47.925
I agree with Lim.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.636
Everyone, including you,
is always telling me

07:50.720 --> 07:51.971
I'm not emotional enough,

07:52.054 --> 07:54.682
and now you are saying
that I am too emotional?

07:54.765 --> 07:57.810
Are you not angry right now, Shaun?

07:57.894 --> 07:59.103
Are you not scared?

07:59.812 --> 08:01.397
You're as emotional as anyone.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.232
Maybe you don't have access to it,

08:03.316 --> 08:06.152
maybe you don't understand--
Well, nobody understands it.

08:06.235 --> 08:07.904
It's just that that's not the issue.

08:11.032 --> 08:15.036
If I hadn't been scared,
we wouldn't be here.

08:15.119 --> 08:16.996
I wouldn't have ordered the tests,

08:17.079 --> 08:19.207
and Lea would have lost the baby.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.168
My emotion helped.

08:25.421 --> 08:26.631
[sighs]

08:26.714 --> 08:28.341
Dr. Lim made the right call.

08:31.719 --> 08:33.262
Considering Maxine's age,

08:33.346 --> 08:35.515
stopping her heart
and placing her on bypass

08:35.598 --> 08:37.016
is way too risky.

08:38.559 --> 08:40.645
What about robotic-assisted surgery?

08:40.728 --> 08:42.563
Adapt the approach
used in cardiac tumors

08:42.647 --> 08:44.982
to remove the device
while her heart's still beating.

08:45.066 --> 08:48.569
I'm sorry, but should we really
be operating on this woman at all?

08:48.653 --> 08:51.405
A DNR is one thing,
but now we're considering

08:51.489 --> 08:54.116
an experimental elective surgery
for the sole purpose

08:54.200 --> 08:55.826
of facilitating the patient's death.

08:55.910 --> 08:58.955
She agreed to the device
to save her life, not prolong her death.

08:59.038 --> 09:02.166
Is that what we're doing
when we treat terminally ill patients?

09:02.708 --> 09:03.876
She's making a mistake.

09:03.960 --> 09:05.503
She's making a choice.

09:05.586 --> 09:06.837
Which is hers to make.

09:06.921 --> 09:08.130
But it doesn't make sense.

09:08.214 --> 09:11.259
She's more full of life
than any patient I've treated this month.

09:11.342 --> 09:12.635
So talk to her.

09:12.843 --> 09:14.095
Make her change her mind.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.056
Or maybe she'll change yours.

09:29.068 --> 09:30.486
[sighs softly]

10:01.559 --> 10:02.977
I love you, too.

10:09.233 --> 10:10.192
Pong.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.403
I've been waiting for that Red Dragon.

10:17.533 --> 10:19.910
You're ready for your close-up,
Ms. Stanley.

10:19.994 --> 10:22.121
A <i>Sunset Boulevard</i> reference.

10:22.204 --> 10:24.415
And you were born, what, ten years ago?

10:24.498 --> 10:26.167
[chuckles] I've never seen it,

10:26.250 --> 10:29.086
but my Bubbe--
Uh, grandmother,

10:29.170 --> 10:31.213
used to say it all the time.

10:31.672 --> 10:33.549
She's the one who taught me Mah Jong.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.177
Well, was she as naive as you think I am?

10:38.220 --> 10:40.556
You have better things to do, young man.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.434
And at this point in my life,
I don't need any new friends.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.107
Do you want to die?

10:50.191 --> 10:52.860
[chuckling]
Something only the young would ask.

10:52.943 --> 10:55.112
Thinking there's actually an option.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.781
Well, sometimes, if you're lucky,

10:56.864 --> 10:58.783
there's a choice about when.

10:59.825 --> 11:02.036
And sometimes, if you're really lucky,

11:02.119 --> 11:04.121
there's a choice about how.

11:05.665 --> 11:07.667
I want to die on the dance floor

11:08.250 --> 11:11.212
with a song in my heart,
drink in my hand.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.465
You want me to die
a few months later,

11:14.548 --> 11:18.302
in pain, not knowing
who I am or where I am.

11:19.637 --> 11:22.723
Forgive me for not saying
thanks for the opportunity.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.393
Ah!

11:25.476 --> 11:26.685

21:14.898 --> 21:16.525
Could we use TPA to dissolve it?

21:16.608 --> 21:19.695
Anticoagulants are too risky
during pregnancy.

21:20.153 --> 21:22.114
Maybe we just keep an eye on the clot

21:22.197 --> 21:24.032
and hope it breaks up on its own.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.660
Bed rest increases
the likelihood of more clots.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.037
I think we should insert an IVC filter.

That would trap future clots
before they get to the lungs.

to make sure the baby
could tolerate the procedure.

28:48.309 --> 28:50.145

So, after we implanted the filter,
