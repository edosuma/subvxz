01:58.910 --> 02:02.080
I'm so... alone.

02:30.733 --> 02:32.068
The girl of my dreams?

02:34.445 --> 02:36.072
It's time to wake up, dude.

02:41.578 --> 02:43.580
I had a dream about that girl again.

02:45.540 --> 02:47.750
I didn't care the first time you told me.

02:47.750 --> 02:49.169
I care even less now.

02:54.007 --> 02:58.052
<i>But she has cool hair and wheels.</i>

02:58.052 --> 02:59.762
Wow! So specific.

02:59.762 --> 03:02.390
- When are you getting your own place?
- Isn't this my place?

03:03.308 --> 03:06.603
No, I let you crash here one time,
and you never left.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.271
That's not how I remember it.

03:08.897 --> 03:10.815
Could you at least get your own stuff?

03:11.858 --> 03:13.443
I have stuff.

03:15.195 --> 03:17.530
You do not have stuff.

03:20.074 --> 03:21.034
Can I have some?

03:21.034 --> 03:23.286
Some of <i>my</i> coffee?

03:23.786 --> 03:26.039
I don't have to take this guff from you.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.875
You're right. You don't. So leave.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.005
I was just about to anyway.

03:40.428 --> 03:43.514
<i>Toronto, Canada. Not too long ago.</i>

03:53.733 --> 03:55.652
We are Sex Bob-omb!

03:55.652 --> 03:57.153
One! Two! Three! Four!

03:58.112 --> 03:59.906
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

04:03.034 --> 04:04.786
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

04:07.872 --> 04:12.001
<i>Can't find my way around</i>

04:12.877 --> 04:16.881
<i>When the sun comes up, I'm down</i>

04:17.882 --> 04:19.884
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

04:21.094 --> 04:22.011
<i>I feel fine!</i>

04:23.429 --> 04:25.056
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

04:26.099 --> 04:28.101
- <i>I don't feel good</i>
- <i>I feel fine!</i>

04:38.569 --> 04:40.238
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

04:41.114 --> 04:42.407
<i>I feel fine!</i>

04:43.449 --> 04:45.410
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

04:46.244 --> 04:47.912
- <i>I don't feel good!
- I feel fine!</i>

04:52.667 --> 04:58.256
Wow! You might be
the best band of all time.

04:58.256 --> 04:59.340
We're not.

04:59.340 --> 05:03.511
Maybe Knives has really good taste
and knows things others don't.

05:03.511 --> 05:04.887
Wouldn't count on it.

05:06.055 --> 05:07.056
Want to do it again?

05:07.056 --> 05:08.516
Let's do it again!

05:10.059 --> 05:11.769
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

05:25.033 --> 05:27.702
Why aren't you bringing
your new girlfriend to Julie's party?

05:27.702 --> 05:29.704
She's not really my girlfriend.

05:29.704 --> 05:31.372
Then what is she?

05:31.372 --> 05:34.667
She's sort of my girlfriend.

05:34.667 --> 05:37.253
Scott, your life is so interesting.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.255
Thanks, Kim.

05:39.255 --> 05:42.216
Oh, that was sarcasm.

05:46.304 --> 05:48.431
All right, you guys want to... What?

06:36.771 --> 06:37.605
Hey.

06:38.564 --> 06:39.399
Hi.

06:42.985 --> 06:44.695
You know Sonic the Hedgehog?

06:46.531 --> 06:48.449
You probably know this,
but in the early 90s,

06:48.449 --> 06:52.120
there were two different Sonic cartoons
airing at the same time.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.746
One was dark and dramatic.

06:53.746 --> 06:56.416
The other was a hilarious comedy
about chili dogs.

06:56.416 --> 06:59.627
And the same guy played Sonic
in both shows.

06:59.627 --> 07:00.711
Isn't that wild?

07:00.711 --> 07:03.881
The same guy playing
two different versions of the same guy?

07:05.508 --> 07:10.054
Maybe you didn't watch cartoons,
or you're not into chili dogs.

07:11.514 --> 07:12.432
They're okay.

07:13.433 --> 07:15.852
I mostly watched older stuff
when I was a kid.

07:15.852 --> 07:17.603
You know, <i>Columbo</i> reruns.

07:17.603 --> 07:20.064
Reruns. Cool, got it.

07:21.441 --> 07:22.567
Are you real?

07:23.151 --> 07:25.069
Did you just ask me if I was real?

07:25.069 --> 07:28.156
No, I was talking to someone else. Bye!

07:38.583 --> 07:39.792
Why are you here?

07:39.792 --> 07:41.002
I'm a plus-one.

07:41.002 --> 07:42.920
There were no plus-ones.

07:42.920 --> 07:45.715
Everyone here is someone
I invited personally.

07:45.715 --> 07:47.550
My parties are curated.

07:48.801 --> 07:52.346
So, do you know
this one girl with hair like this?

07:54.015 --> 07:55.766
Ramona Flowers?

07:56.350 --> 07:57.477
Ramona.

07:57.977 --> 07:59.979
- She's from New York City.
- The Big Apple.

07:59.979 --> 08:01.814
She moved here after a bad breakup.

08:01.814 --> 08:02.940
She's single.

08:02.940 --> 08:05.276
Got a job delivering DVDs for Netflix.

08:05.276 --> 08:06.819
DVDs for Netflix.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.906
- I'm like her only friend in town.
- She needs friends.

08:09.906 --> 08:12.408
I forbid you from dating her,
Scott Pilgrim!

08:13.034 --> 08:14.535
Cool. Thanks, Julie. Bye.

08:20.500 --> 08:22.877
Wallace, quick! What movie should I rent?

08:22.877 --> 08:24.629
You're banned from No-Account Video.

08:24.629 --> 08:27.632
You owe, like,
a gajillion dollars in late fees.

08:27.632 --> 08:31.385
Not the rental place.
I'm using the World Wide Web.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.595
What should I rent?

08:34.096 --> 08:36.432
Something starring a hot guy.

08:40.561 --> 08:42.522
I think I need the name of a hot guy.

08:43.231 --> 08:44.065
Fine.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.108
Lucas Lee.

08:46.108 --> 08:47.902
Best chest in the business.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.571
<i>Action Doctor,
Let's Hope There's A Heaven,</i>

08:50.571 --> 08:51.614
<i>Thrilled To Be Here.</i>

08:51.614 --> 08:55.826
<i>The Game Is Over 2!</i>
It's over a second time! That sounds fun.

08:58.746 --> 09:00.456
Are you waiting for the DVD?

09:01.207 --> 09:02.416
It's gonna take a bit.

09:02.917 --> 09:04.126
How long could it take?

09:20.726 --> 09:21.602
Sonic guy?

09:22.645 --> 09:24.355
Yes, that's me.

09:24.939 --> 09:27.483
Are you "Wallace Wells"?

09:27.984 --> 09:30.945
No, I'm Scott. Scott Pilgrim.

09:30.945 --> 09:32.863
Wallace is my cool, gay roommate.

09:32.863 --> 09:34.574
He lets me use his credit card.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.700
Oh.

09:35.700 --> 09:38.077
So like a sugar daddy situation?

09:39.745 --> 09:40.621
Sugar what?

09:42.498 --> 09:44.917
Cool. Enjoy your DVD, Mr. Wells.

09:47.044 --> 09:48.629
- Wait.
- Hmm?

09:49.255 --> 09:51.340
Are you the person in my dreams?

09:51.841 --> 09:53.634
I thought we went over this already.

09:53.634 --> 09:55.761
So, you are? Isn't that weird?

09:55.761 --> 09:57.179
It's not weird at all.

09:59.890 --> 10:03.311
There's just a convenient subspace highway
running through your head.

10:03.853 --> 10:06.022
<i>It's like three miles in 15 seconds.</i>

10:07.231 --> 10:10.109
I don't know what that is in kilometers.

10:10.901 --> 10:13.404
Space subways. Totally. I get it.

10:13.404 --> 10:15.197
Anyway, want to go out sometime?

10:16.324 --> 10:18.909
You want to go on a date? With me?

10:18.909 --> 10:22.038
Doesn't have to be a date.
It could be a low-key team-up.

10:22.038 --> 10:25.249
Canada and America joining forces?

10:25.249 --> 10:29.003
You're new in town. I'm old in town.
What do you think?

10:35.509 --> 10:37.178
Why are you just standing there?

10:37.678 --> 10:39.513
Dude, I'm waiting on you.

10:42.558 --> 10:45.770
It's getting nice out, eh?
I didn't really need the parka.

10:46.437 --> 10:48.064
What's with the "X" anyway?

10:48.773 --> 10:49.899
Oh, this?

10:50.691 --> 10:53.778
Well, obviously, one of us
went to Professor Xavier's school

10:53.778 --> 10:56.322
for gifted youngsters,
and one of us did not.

10:57.156 --> 10:58.532
Is that a Sonic thing?

10:59.241 --> 11:01.285
Is it Sonic?

11:01.285 --> 11:03.245
No, it isn't.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.082
So, why'd you move to Toronto?

11:06.582 --> 11:09.043
Just so you could go to Julie's parties?

11:09.752 --> 11:10.586
No.

11:11.128 --> 11:13.422
Well, I got the job
delivering DVDs for Netflix,

11:13.422 --> 11:17.134
and Gideon always said Toronto
is one of the great cities. So...

11:18.177 --> 11:19.345
Is Gideon a boyfriend?

11:19.929 --> 11:21.847
He's a friend.

11:23.391 --> 11:24.892
So, what do you do?

11:25.851 --> 11:27.103
I'm between jobs.

11:28.771 --> 11:30.272
Between what and what?

11:30.272 --> 11:33.984
Well, my last job is
a really long story filled with sighs.

11:35.152 --> 11:37.488
Maybe we can get into it
in a later episode.

11:37.488 --> 11:41.701
We don't have to talk about our pasts.
It's my least favorite subject.

11:43.994 --> 11:47.248
I should have checked the weather.
Guess you need that parka now.

11:48.374 --> 11:52.128
It's just a little bit of snow.
Did it snow where you came from?

11:52.628 --> 11:55.047
I thought we were avoiding the past.

11:55.047 --> 11:58.008
Where you're from?
That's not the past. That's a location.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.845
Fine.

12:00.845 --> 12:02.179
Where are you from?

12:03.055 --> 12:04.014
Up north.

12:06.183 --> 12:08.352
Then you're used to
this kind of weather, right?

12:09.645 --> 12:11.522
Yeah. Are you?

12:12.440 --> 12:14.066
I grew up in the mountains, man.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.152
Did you do a lot of skiing?

12:16.152 --> 12:17.820
No, not really.

12:17.820 --> 12:18.779
Yeah.

12:28.080 --> 12:29.707
Bring me Matthew Patel.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.460
The game has begun.

12:33.794 --> 12:34.920
Do you ice skate?

12:35.588 --> 12:38.090
I assumed, considering you rollerblade.

12:38.716 --> 12:40.593
I did figure skating when I was four.

12:41.886 --> 12:42.762
Look at that.

12:43.679 --> 12:45.723
You got me talking about the past again.

12:45.723 --> 12:48.100
You're quite the trickster, Scott Pilgrim.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.478
And I wasn't even trying.

12:54.273 --> 12:55.900
This really picked up.

12:56.984 --> 12:59.153
Ramona, I can't see you!

12:59.153 --> 13:01.405
Relax. Take my hand.

13:03.491 --> 13:06.076
There should be a door around here.

13:13.501 --> 13:15.544
What?

13:20.382 --> 13:22.092
This is your apartment.

13:22.092 --> 13:24.762
So, that star door
was one of your space subways?

13:25.387 --> 13:26.931
Basically. Yeah.

13:26.931 --> 13:29.225
Good thing this wasn't a real date.

13:29.225 --> 13:32.019
Otherwise, it would qualify
as a major disaster.

13:34.396 --> 13:35.773
I'll make us some tea.

13:40.444 --> 13:41.987
You look like you're dying.

13:42.488 --> 13:43.864
Let me get you a blanket.

14:01.632 --> 14:03.300
Dude, I'm changing.

14:03.300 --> 14:06.595
Sorry. I'm just cold and innocent.

14:06.595 --> 14:09.557
There you go.
Now I can't see anything. That's better.

14:10.724 --> 14:11.976
Does this help?

14:12.560 --> 14:13.769
I'm cold too.

14:27.032 --> 14:29.076
- Sparks.
- Uh-huh.

14:30.744 --> 14:34.456
Were you just gonna bring
the blanket from your bed?

14:34.957 --> 14:35.791
I guess.

14:36.292 --> 14:40.963
Maybe we could both get under it
while it's on the bed

14:41.839 --> 14:44.884
since we're both... cold.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.730
I'm not sure if I'm ready.

15:00.399 --> 15:01.525
I changed my mind.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.904
From what to what?

15:04.904 --> 15:07.781
I don't wanna have sex with you, Pilgrim.
Not right now.

15:08.574 --> 15:10.451
That's okay. That's cool.

15:10.951 --> 15:14.038
I'm not gonna send you home
in a snowstorm, or anything.

15:14.038 --> 15:15.414
You can sleep in my bed.

15:15.998 --> 15:19.919
And I reserve the right to change
my mind about the sex later.

15:21.795 --> 15:22.755
Awesome.

15:30.471 --> 15:31.889
You sent for me?

15:32.473 --> 15:33.557
I did.

15:35.225 --> 15:37.686
I just wanted to say thanks
for creating this league.

15:37.686 --> 15:39.229
It's pretty high-concept.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.398
I didn't bring you here for flattery.

15:41.398 --> 15:43.317
Things have taken a turn.

15:44.026 --> 15:46.862
It seems our dear Ramona has a new suitor.

15:47.363 --> 15:49.114
It's really happening? Who is he?

15:49.114 --> 15:52.701
My interns compiled
extensive research on the subject.

15:53.494 --> 15:58.207
Scott Pilgrim, 23-years-old.
Lives in Toronto, Canada.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.667
Jobless, hopeless.

15:59.667 --> 16:02.461
He's in an indie band
of subjective quality.

16:02.461 --> 16:04.129
How long have they been dating?

16:04.672 --> 16:08.676
They've been on one date,
but he's currently sleeping in her bed.

16:08.676 --> 16:10.094
That bastard!

16:10.094 --> 16:13.764
Indeed.
But this is where it gets interesting.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.433
Scott Pilgrim is dating a high schooler.

16:16.433 --> 16:17.351
What?

16:18.227 --> 16:21.772
Wait, I'm sorry.
Did you say he's dating a high schooler?

16:21.772 --> 16:23.315
Dating may be a strong word.

16:23.315 --> 16:28.320
Our intel says they've never kissed,
but they did hold hands once.

16:29.863 --> 16:31.156
Does Ramona know?

16:32.032 --> 16:33.784
He hasn't told her yet.

16:33.784 --> 16:36.620
Wow! And I thought we were evil.

16:37.579 --> 16:38.956
What's his fight experience?

16:38.956 --> 16:43.585
He's been described as, quote,
"The best fighter in the province."

16:43.585 --> 16:44.586
Unquote.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.297
This scumbag sounds like a challenge.

16:47.297 --> 16:48.841
Are you worried?

16:48.841 --> 16:52.845
No, I'm glad it won't be easy.
I'll relish this victory.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.389
Ramona's new guy
is gonna wish he was never born

16:55.389 --> 16:57.891
because his brutal death is inevitable!

16:57.891 --> 16:58.976
Because of me.

16:59.685 --> 17:01.478
Because I'm gonna kill him.

17:01.478 --> 17:02.980
And then he'll be dead.

17:03.647 --> 17:09.778
I hope Scott Pilgrim enjoys the final few
days of his precious little life.

17:19.913 --> 17:21.290
What time is it?

17:21.874 --> 17:23.333
Not quite 8:00 a.m.

17:23.333 --> 17:26.670
I have to work, so you have to leave.

17:30.174 --> 17:33.177
Hey, can this not be a one-night stand?

17:33.177 --> 17:35.554
For one thing,
I'm not even sure if it would count.

17:37.598 --> 17:38.640
I'll consider it.

17:43.312 --> 17:44.563
What did you have in mind?

17:45.981 --> 17:49.943
Oh! My band has a show tonight.
At the Rockit, 9:00 p.m.

17:49.943 --> 17:51.612
You have a band?

17:52.112 --> 17:55.115
Yeah. We're terrible. Please come.

17:57.117 --> 18:00.829
Yeah, okay. 9:00 p.m.
The Rockit. I'll be there.

18:10.964 --> 18:13.258
I bet you're wondering
why I never came home last night.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.010
I did wonder how I got so lucky.

18:15.594 --> 18:17.596
Well, actually,
I am the one who got lucky,

18:17.596 --> 18:22.351
because I spent the night
with the girl of, or from, my dreams.

18:23.143 --> 18:24.520
Ramona Flowers.

18:24.520 --> 18:25.562
Congrats.

18:26.355 --> 18:29.358
You need to break up
with your fake high school girlfriend.

18:30.484 --> 18:31.860
Do I have to?

18:31.860 --> 18:34.446
I mean, are we really even dating?

18:34.446 --> 18:37.658
Knives thinks you are,
and Knives is an angel.

18:37.658 --> 18:39.660
You need to end it immediately.

18:40.244 --> 18:43.413
Fine, you're right. I'll do it.

18:44.790 --> 18:45.707
Good.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.793
By the way, there's a letter for you.

18:52.756 --> 18:55.634
"Dear Mr. Pilgrim,
my name is Matthew Patel."

18:56.260 --> 19:01.014
"I challenge you to a..." blah, blah, blah,
something about fighting...

19:02.599 --> 19:04.601
"League of Evil Exes..."

19:06.019 --> 19:08.438
More like a League of boring.

19:09.398 --> 19:12.568
- You coming to our show tonight?
- Unfortunately, yes.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.455
Hey, Knives.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.082
Have you met Stacey?

19:28.000 --> 19:31.044
Wow! I've heard so much about you.

19:31.795 --> 19:33.046
So, how goes it?

19:33.046 --> 19:36.800
I am 16 kinds of pumped
to see Sex Bob-omb tonight.

19:36.800 --> 19:38.260
That's how it goes!

19:38.844 --> 19:41.847
I feel so excited
I might actually pass out!

19:44.057 --> 19:47.936
Boy, it sure seems like nobody delivered
crushing news to you today.

19:47.936 --> 19:51.732
Crushing? Like, a bad kind of crushing?

19:51.732 --> 19:53.734
Oh, you poor thing!

19:53.734 --> 19:55.944
You're better than him.
Just know that. Okay?

19:55.944 --> 19:57.029
Better than who?

19:59.656 --> 20:00.490
Scott!

20:07.623 --> 20:10.042
I have to go.

20:11.335 --> 20:12.544
Huh?

20:17.257 --> 20:18.926
Why are you stressing, Scott?

20:19.509 --> 20:21.929
Who's stressing? Stephen's stressing.

20:21.929 --> 20:24.681
Of course I'm stressing.
The opening band pulled out.

20:24.681 --> 20:25.807
They flaked!

20:25.807 --> 20:28.143
Crash and the Boys flaked?

20:28.894 --> 20:32.481
I heard they were changing it
to just "Crash" and losing the "Boys."

20:33.106 --> 20:34.608
You can't call a band "Crash."

20:34.608 --> 20:38.195
<i>Crash</i> is a cult classic car crash sex film
shot right here in Toronto.

20:38.195 --> 20:40.072
I didn't know you were a cinephile.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.448
What's a cinephile?

20:42.282 --> 20:43.408
Crash, Boys.

20:43.408 --> 20:46.787
Either way, they probably
canceled because they think we suck.

20:46.787 --> 20:48.080
We probably do.

20:48.872 --> 20:50.123
That's not funny, Kim.

20:50.123 --> 20:52.709
If we suck,
then the audience won't like us.

20:52.709 --> 20:53.919
They'll think we suck.

20:54.795 --> 20:57.130
- Maybe we should cancel the show.
- Hey.

20:57.130 --> 21:01.134
There's only one way to find out
if we suck, and that's by playing...

21:01.134 --> 21:02.052
now.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.193
So, are you a fan of Sex Bob-omb?

21:18.694 --> 21:21.488
No, I'm kind of
seeing someone in the band.

21:22.072 --> 21:24.825
That's crazy! I am too!

21:24.825 --> 21:26.243
Who are you dating in the band?

21:26.243 --> 21:28.370
We are Sex Bob-omb!

21:28.370 --> 21:30.122
One! Two! Three! Four!

21:30.122 --> 21:32.374
<i>In your orange shirt</i>

21:34.001 --> 21:35.836
<i>We'll go for yogurt</i>

21:37.421 --> 21:40.173
<i>Wish I could paint you
Whoa-oh-oh</i>

21:41.008 --> 21:43.510
<i>I'd never do you justice</i>

21:45.470 --> 21:46.805
<i>Oh yeah</i>

21:48.348 --> 21:50.100
<i>Oh yeah</i>

21:52.894 --> 21:55.897
<i>I only wanted to be near you</i>

21:55.897 --> 21:59.359
<i>I only wanted to be close to someone</i>

21:59.359 --> 22:02.738
<i>I only wanted to be next to you</i>

22:06.199 --> 22:07.617
Mr. Pilgrim.

22:17.002 --> 22:18.128
<i>Reversal!</i>

22:23.216 --> 22:24.760
Wait, hold on.

22:25.302 --> 22:27.637
Who are you exactly,
and why are we fighting?

22:28.805 --> 22:30.057
Aren't you Scott Pilgrim?

22:30.057 --> 22:31.516
Depends who's asking.

22:32.434 --> 22:33.560
It is I...

22:38.190 --> 22:42.110
Matthew Patel,
Ramona's first evil ex-boyfriend.

22:45.864 --> 22:48.492
Cool. And you're here because...?

22:48.492 --> 22:49.785
Didn't you read my letter?

22:50.619 --> 22:51.453
Kind of.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.664
I hand-delivered it during a blizzard.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.167
Remind me what it said, exactly.

22:59.336 --> 23:03.340
It said,
“Ramona Flowers has seven evil exes,

23:03.340 --> 23:05.675
each more powerful than the last."

23:05.675 --> 23:08.387
"All of whom you must defeat
in order to date her.”

23:08.387 --> 23:09.805
<i>We're evil exes.</i>

23:09.805 --> 23:11.223
<i>We dated Ramona.</i>

23:11.223 --> 23:14.518
- <i>Evil.</i>
- <i>Evil.</i>

23:14.518 --> 23:16.478
It was a very detailed letter!

23:16.978 --> 23:17.938
You knew about this?

23:17.938 --> 23:21.274
Right, yeah, I heard about it.

23:21.274 --> 23:22.943
I sort of thought it was a joke?

23:22.943 --> 23:24.861
And you really dated this guy?

23:25.362 --> 23:27.531
Yeah. In middle school.

23:29.616 --> 23:31.785
<i>It was football season,
and for some reason,</i>

23:31.785 --> 23:33.328
<i>all the little jocks wanted me.</i>

23:33.912 --> 23:37.290
<i>Matthew Patel was the only
non-white, non-jock boy in school,</i>

23:37.791 --> 23:40.001
<i>maybe the only one for miles around.</i>

23:40.001 --> 23:43.630
<i>So, we joined forces and took 'em all out.</i>

23:44.131 --> 23:46.133
<i>Nothing could beat
Matthew's mystical powers</i>

23:46.133 --> 23:48.301
<i>combined with my brute strength.</i>

23:48.802 --> 23:53.098
We only kissed once, and we were quits
after something like a week and a half.

23:53.098 --> 23:55.183
He didn't even get truly evil
until high school,

23:55.183 --> 23:57.561
and by that time, he lived far, far away.

23:58.145 --> 23:59.729
Mystical powers?

23:59.729 --> 24:00.981
Unfair.

24:01.690 --> 24:03.942
All's fair in love and...

24:05.277 --> 24:07.946
War? I think it's war.

24:07.946 --> 24:09.364
Time to fight!

24:10.615 --> 24:13.201
<i>Matthew Patel versus Scott Pilgrim.</i>

24:13.201 --> 24:15.162
<i>Round one. Fight.</i>

24:44.858 --> 24:45.984
<i>KO?</i>

24:50.989 --> 24:52.991
I won?

24:54.493 --> 24:55.660
I won!
