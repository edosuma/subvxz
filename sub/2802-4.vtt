worth sticking around for.

that Spanish Harlem job went bad,

he secretly hates me.
If he wasn't so jumpy.

I mean, if you can't handle stress,
try needlepoint.

24:41.607 --> 24:44.234
All right, so Devlin
won't just hand over a name.

Is Jones still outside?

-You guys are a long way from home.
-Eh, we're just in the neighborhood.

that guy works for Navarro.

That guy works for Navarro?
What are you guys into?

25:54.888 --> 25:56.390
Nothing, okay?

25:57.850 --> 26:01.103
A guy from around here named Tommy Barnes
stole 100 grand from Navarro.

26:01.186 --> 26:03.856
-Word is somebody made him a fake ID.
-Oh, crap, man.

26:03.939 --> 26:05.607
Navarro thinks I did it.

26:05.691 --> 26:06.859
Holy crap.

Here he comes.

You owe me
from that Spanish Harlem debacle.

Mozz, I got your back, man.

You.

You got the wrong guy, I swear.

Look, man. Hi.

I know who you are, okay?
I don't want any trouble.

26:25.502 --> 26:27.754
That guy there,
he was just bragging about an ID

26:27.838 --> 26:29.256
he made for a guy named Tommy Barnes.

I did no such thing,
I don't have a death wish.

Hey, he told me Tommy's new name
is Sam Brennan.

26:34.595 --> 26:36.513
Okay? Sam Brennan. That's what he said.

-I need good news.

27:07.419 --> 27:08.921
A taxi driver came forward.

27:09.004 --> 27:12.049
A man matching Tommy's description
caught a cab near the park yesterday.

27:12.132 --> 27:15.469
Said he'd give him $5,000 to drive him
to Chicago without calling it in.

27:15.552 --> 27:16.678
Why is the driver talking?

27:16.762 --> 27:18.514
Because Tommy only gave him $400.

27:18.597 --> 27:20.474
He made him turn around
at the Jersey Turnpike.

27:20.891 --> 27:22.601
But look at what he paid with.

27:27.439 --> 27:28.732
These are sequential bills.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.400
Tommy hasn't made any withdrawals.

27:30.484 --> 27:32.110
So he's using the money
he took from Sal's.

27:32.194 --> 27:34.279
Navarro's laundering money through Sal's.

27:34.363 --> 27:36.281
That's why he wants
that particular 100 grand back.

27:36.365 --> 27:37.658
Because it can be traced.

35:50.984 --> 35:52.653
Everybody wins.

35:54.238 --> 35:57.241
I like it, except for one thing.

35:57.324 --> 35:58.575
What's that?

35:58.659 --> 36:00.494
Nothing's perfect.

36:00.577 --> 36:02.579
You just brokered yourself a deal.

36:04.414 --> 36:08.043
It's perfect, because one side will always
try to outsmart the other.

36:08.126 --> 36:10.712
Navarro knows that Tommy
can't walk in with a weapon.

36:10.796 --> 36:12.256
So Navarro's gonna make sure

36:12.339 --> 36:14.258
there's one waiting for him
when he gets there.

36:14.341 --> 36:15.843
We stake out the library.

36:15.926 --> 36:18.011
Wait until one of Navarro's guys show up.

36:18.095 --> 36:19.304
He'll keep an eye on the place,

36:19.388 --> 36:21.557
make sure Tommy
doesn't have the same idea,

36:21.640 --> 36:22.641
then he'll plant the gun.

36:22.724 --> 36:24.893
We just follow Navarro's guy
back to Mozzie.

36:27.980 --> 36:30.065
PETER: I know this is boring,
but stay awake.

36:30.148 --> 36:33.402
I haven't slept
since this whole thing started.

36:33.485 --> 36:35.362
Stomach hurt?

36:35.445 --> 36:37.281
A little bit.

36:37.364 --> 36:39.700
Got that parched thing happening?

36:39.783 --> 36:42.202
Yeah, my mouth's a little dry.

36:42.286 --> 36:43.745
Hold onto that feeling.

36:43.829 --> 36:45.664
Remember it the next time you decide

36:45.747 --> 36:47.958
to infiltrate the den of a mobster
on a whim,

36:48.041 --> 36:50.043
or something equally cockeyed.

36:50.127 --> 36:53.088
Thanks for sharing your feelings, Peter.
I know that's sometimes difficult for you.

36:53.172 --> 36:54.173
You're welcome.

36:55.048 --> 36:57.092
PETER: That looks like Navarro's guy.

36:57.176 --> 36:58.969
NEAL: He's here to plant the gun.

36:59.052 --> 37:01.597
We follow him back to Mozzie,
it'll all be over.

37:01.680 --> 37:03.140
I hope so.

37:07.686 --> 37:09.188
Oh, that's reassuring.

37:09.855 --> 37:11.815
The perfect exchange.

37:11.899 --> 37:13.358
When did you pull it off?

37:13.942 --> 37:16.695
A certain FBI agent came into my life.
I didn't get the chance.

37:16.778 --> 37:18.697
PETER: So it's hypothetical.
NEAL: Yeah.

37:18.780 --> 37:20.574
What happens to the middleman?

37:20.657 --> 37:22.242
We didn't have one.

37:22.326 --> 37:24.536
When Vince tells Navarro
that the gun's in place,

37:24.620 --> 37:27.956
he's got his meeting time,
location and a stashed weapon.

37:28.749 --> 37:30.542
Mozzie's about to become irrelevant.

37:33.962 --> 37:35.964
-I wanna go in there.
-Hold on.

37:43.889 --> 37:45.807
-(KEYPAD BEEPING)
-Take me to Navarro.

37:52.105 --> 37:53.482
GINA: Mozzie.

37:55.484 --> 37:56.735
Mozzie.

37:57.819 --> 37:59.446
How did you end up here alone?

38:01.323 --> 38:02.950
I followed your clues.

38:03.617 --> 38:05.077
You did leave them for me?

38:05.160 --> 38:07.287
Yes, yes, from our talks and our books,

38:07.371 --> 38:10.666
but I was hoping you would share them
with the FBI or the cops.

38:10.749 --> 38:12.125
NAVARRO: Cut the talking.

38:13.710 --> 38:15.921
Sal's is a dud. Set up somewhere else.

38:16.004 --> 38:18.382
We gotta find a new place for the money.

38:18.465 --> 38:19.675
MAN: I'll make some calls.

38:19.758 --> 38:22.302
-NAVARRO: What's taking Vince so long?
-Tommy wouldn't come for me, would he?

38:22.386 --> 38:24.388
Let's not think about that now.

38:24.471 --> 38:26.348
-(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
-NAVARRO: Good.

38:27.975 --> 38:29.518
Vince is back.

38:29.601 --> 38:31.061
This is it. Get ready.

38:31.144 --> 38:33.438
-What's happening?
-Something big, I hope.

38:35.941 --> 38:37.401
Mr. Broker.

38:38.277 --> 38:40.821
Seems I don't need you anymore.

38:40.904 --> 38:42.114
(GASPS)

38:43.490 --> 38:45.033
Oh, damn it.

38:46.243 --> 38:47.661
There is no middleman.

38:47.744 --> 38:49.413
What does that mean?

38:51.081 --> 38:53.250
FBI. Drop your weapon.

38:53.333 --> 38:56.044
Drop it. Stay where you are.

38:56.128 --> 38:57.671
-(GRUNTS)
-(GINA GASPS)

39:00.048 --> 39:01.133
Put your gun down.

39:01.216 --> 39:02.759
You keep showing up.

39:03.510 --> 39:05.846
I don't like surprises.

39:05.929 --> 39:07.389
And I don't like feds.

39:07.472 --> 39:09.933
You know what else
you're not gonna like? Prison.

39:10.017 --> 39:13.896
-Drop your weapon.
-Oh, I don't plan to go to prison.

39:13.979 --> 39:15.981
JONES: FBI! Drop your weapons.

39:16.064 --> 39:18.150
-Drop your weapons now.
-AGENT 1: Put it down.

39:18.233 --> 39:20.027
Looks like your plans just changed.

39:20.110 --> 39:23.113
AGENT 2: Now!
AGENT 3: Weapons down, right there.

39:27.284 --> 39:28.410
NEAL: Mozz.

39:28.493 --> 39:29.912
-Hey.
-You okay?

39:30.829 --> 39:32.080
-Middleman.
-Middleman.

39:32.164 --> 39:34.958
Yup. We might wanna rename
the perfect exchange.

39:35.042 --> 39:36.668
(CHUCKLES)

39:37.461 --> 39:38.837
I got it, I got it.

39:42.007 --> 39:43.091
Thank you.

39:44.092 --> 39:45.093
NEAL: Hey.

39:51.141 --> 39:54.436
So, have you talked to Tommy?

39:56.480 --> 39:57.856
We broke up.

40:02.027 --> 40:04.321
Today's my last day at the diner, though.

40:04.821 --> 40:06.031
I've been saving

40:06.114 --> 40:08.700
and I think it's time
for an adventure of my own.

40:08.784 --> 40:10.327
I'm gonna go to California.

40:14.414 --> 40:15.791
"It's goodbye.

40:17.042 --> 40:22.381
"But we lean forward to the next
crazy venture beneath the skies."

40:24.258 --> 40:25.676
Kerouac.

40:25.759 --> 40:27.177
He also went to California.

40:28.512 --> 40:32.391
I wouldn't do well there.
I like my shoes to cover my toes.

40:43.569 --> 40:45.529
"You're cute too."

40:54.997 --> 40:58.292
How many dinners with Elizabeth
have you missed because of me?

40:58.375 --> 41:00.586
I don't keep count.

41:00.669 --> 41:02.296
Well, I've lost count.

41:03.547 --> 41:05.966
So Mozzie had you worried.

41:06.049 --> 41:08.510
How does it feel to walk
a mile in my shoes?

41:09.511 --> 41:11.388
I prefer Italian leather.

41:12.222 --> 41:13.640
How's Gina?

41:13.724 --> 41:17.144
She's showing signs
of a bodyguard complex.

41:17.227 --> 41:19.730
I told her some distance
between us would be good.

41:19.813 --> 41:22.024
Yeah, a guy like you needs his space.

41:23.025 --> 41:24.902
So we heading to the Bureau?

41:27.321 --> 41:30.616
I got the FBI onboard with Caffrey,
but you?

41:30.699 --> 41:32.701
I don't even know your real name.

41:32.784 --> 41:33.952
And I've looked.

41:35.621 --> 41:37.497
Thanks for the pen, by the way.

41:37.581 --> 41:38.999
What pen? I got…

41:39.958 --> 41:41.502
Earned it. It's mine now.

41:41.585 --> 41:43.629
PETER: No, it's not yours, no.
NEAL: No.

41:43.712 --> 41:44.838
(ARGUING INDISTINCTLY)

41:44.922 --> 41:46.632
NEAL: Peter…
PETER: You gotta give me the pen.
