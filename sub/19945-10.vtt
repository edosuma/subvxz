WEBVTT

00:46.421 --> 00:50.008
You all know I had to reset
my sobriety clock a few times,

00:50.092 --> 00:54.137
so this little two-year chip
feels pretty big right now.

00:54.888 --> 00:56.765
This year, it's had its up and downs.

00:58.267 --> 01:01.728
- But where I am today...
- We just passed 8,000 orders!

01:01.812 --> 01:03.063
Would you shush?

01:03.146 --> 01:05.524
Oh, relax. Nobody can hear me.

01:06.441 --> 01:10.362
Um... made my amends,
I'm working full-time.

01:10.445 --> 01:13.282
I regained custody of my lizard, Spencer.

01:14.783 --> 01:17.202
Oh, and I finally moved into my own place.

01:17.286 --> 01:18.704
Yes!

01:23.875 --> 01:27.170
Anyway, um... one day at a time.

01:27.254 --> 01:28.589
Keep coming back.

01:29.506 --> 01:34.094
And hey, how cool is it to get a cake
for not doing something?

01:37.389 --> 01:40.267
-Ow.
-What? That's my Coyote howl.

01:40.350 --> 01:44.646
Couldn't you have named him
something quieter, like Train Horn?

02:06.501 --> 02:08.837
Sober!

02:12.466 --> 02:14.051
I'm really proud of him.

02:14.635 --> 02:15.677
I am, too.

02:16.386 --> 02:18.180
Glad I had a drink before I came.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.974
Ooh, that was the move.

02:21.058 --> 02:23.644
So how are things
at the Continental Congress?

02:23.727 --> 02:27.981
Well, Peter has asked me to stop directing
the other actors in my scenes,

02:28.065 --> 02:29.941
but I don't know, they do things I hate.

02:30.025 --> 02:32.194
Other people are the worst.

02:32.277 --> 02:35.656
I don't want to assume anything,
but I got you tickets for opening night.

02:36.865 --> 02:40.619
Well, I'll make an exception
to my community theater rule.

02:40.702 --> 02:43.830
But if there's audience participation,
I walk.

02:43.914 --> 02:45.374
Fair enough.

02:46.583 --> 02:50.504
I thought I'd take Bud and Coyote out
to Philipe's. Would you like to join us?

02:50.587 --> 02:53.799
Oh, that sounds so good. I'm starving.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.886
-I can't go.
-Why not?

02:57.969 --> 03:00.305
-I'm getting a signal.
-What signal?

03:04.726 --> 03:06.395
Oh, I know that game.

03:08.688 --> 03:11.066
What is it with these people?

03:11.149 --> 03:12.818
I'll get that, honey.

03:13.276 --> 03:14.277
All right.

03:14.361 --> 03:16.738
-What happened to your wrist?
-Carpal tunnel.

03:16.822 --> 03:19.491
-Do you work on a computer a lot?
-No.

03:19.574 --> 03:21.660
-Oh.
-Hey, how come Brianna didn't come?

03:21.743 --> 03:25.580
Oh, she's, um... vacationing in Baltimore.

03:25.664 --> 03:27.124
Barry moved to Baltimore?

03:27.207 --> 03:29.543
Wow, that's a long way to go
to stalk somebody.

03:29.626 --> 03:31.795
Right, like you're not weird as fuck.

03:32.671 --> 03:34.714
I'm gonna go pick an orange
out of the punch.

03:37.551 --> 03:41.513
-That's your house?
-Yeah. All 160 square feet of it.

03:41.596 --> 03:44.015
It's amazing how quickly
you can fill a space.

03:44.099 --> 03:48.854
Do you ever wake up, forget you live
there, and think that you became a giant?

03:48.937 --> 03:50.313
Yes!

03:50.397 --> 03:52.315
No, every morning! I do!

03:52.899 --> 03:53.859
Who's that?

03:53.942 --> 03:58.572
That is Coyote's
"It's not like that" girl, AKA Nadia.

03:58.655 --> 04:00.323
Nadia. Is she Russian?

04:00.407 --> 04:04.286
-No. Calabasas. So, Calabassian.
-Oh.

04:04.369 --> 04:06.413
That looks very "like that" to me.

04:06.496 --> 04:08.790
-Oh, it's so like that.
-What are you talking about?

04:08.874 --> 04:10.625
Coyote's "it's not like that" girl.

04:10.709 --> 04:12.419
Aw, it's totally like that.

04:13.503 --> 04:14.713
-Want some orange?
-Nope.

04:14.796 --> 04:17.132
-Okay.
-Wow, you are one lucky man.

04:17.215 --> 04:18.550
-Can I have some?
-Oh.

04:20.469 --> 04:22.179
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

04:32.773 --> 04:36.067
I need to borrow
your George Foreman grill.

04:36.318 --> 04:38.278
I don't own a George Foreman grill.

04:38.361 --> 04:39.654
You sure?

04:40.197 --> 04:41.782
Then whose George am I holding?

04:41.865 --> 04:43.200
I don't know. Yours?

04:43.283 --> 04:45.368
Huh. Anyway, see you later.

04:46.077 --> 04:47.412
Yeah, hey, Frankie.

04:47.496 --> 04:50.624
Look. Did you not see all these orders
that still have to go out?

04:50.707 --> 04:51.708
Sure do.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.127
But I haven't seen Jacob in weeks

04:54.211 --> 04:56.463
and we're supposed to have
a romantic barbecue.

04:56.546 --> 04:59.174
-Anyway, thanks for the grill.
-Stop.

04:59.257 --> 05:01.802
You can always burn down Jacob's farm
another time.

05:01.885 --> 05:05.472
We have to get all these
to the distribution center by 4:30.

05:05.555 --> 05:07.682
But it's Sunday, the Lord's day.

05:07.766 --> 05:10.936
You're Jewish. Yesterday was your day.

05:11.019 --> 05:13.271
Today is my day and I say we work.

05:13.897 --> 05:15.732
Oh!

05:16.191 --> 05:17.359
Another order.

05:17.442 --> 05:19.945
I just hate to cancel on Jacob again.

05:20.028 --> 05:22.906
He already bought the Tofurger
and Not Dogs for me.

05:22.989 --> 05:26.201
Well, I'm sure those things will taste
just as awful on another day

05:26.284 --> 05:27.494
that's not today.

05:28.870 --> 05:32.833
You know, he and I
have to talk about stuff.

05:33.875 --> 05:34.876
What kind of stuff?

05:35.544 --> 05:39.631
Um... You know...
Jacob and Frankie stuff.

05:39.714 --> 05:43.301
Relationship-oriented chit-chat and such.

05:43.385 --> 05:45.095
Uh-oh. What did you do?

05:45.178 --> 05:47.305
I didn't do anything. I'm delightful.

05:47.389 --> 05:49.933
Well, don't screw it up,
'cause he's a good one.

05:51.017 --> 05:52.352
He really is.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.313
So good, in fact, that I know
he won't mind waiting a little longer

05:55.397 --> 05:57.566
for his chit-chat and facsimile meat.

06:03.238 --> 06:05.865
You know, Grace,
I've been crunching the numbers

06:05.949 --> 06:08.868
and doing some business-oriented
strategizing.

06:08.952 --> 06:10.870
Oh, I can't wait to hear this.

06:10.954 --> 06:15.166
I'm thinking about how people really want
the thing they can't have.

06:15.834 --> 06:17.085
Like the McRib.

06:17.752 --> 06:21.047
If we're gonna create a frenzy
for our product,

06:21.131 --> 06:23.592
we have to take it off the market.

06:24.175 --> 06:25.719
So you want us to shut down?

06:25.802 --> 06:27.137
Interesting.

06:28.638 --> 06:32.392
Now that you mention it, Grace, yes,
we definitely should shut down.

06:33.560 --> 06:36.438
Look, I know it's intense right now,

06:36.521 --> 06:40.233
but we're going to look back at these days
like the most fun we ever had.

06:40.317 --> 06:44.362
When I started Say Grace,
it was the girls and me in the garage

06:44.446 --> 06:46.781
every weekend packing up skin cream.

06:46.865 --> 06:50.243
Didn't Brianna report you
for child labor violations?

06:50.327 --> 06:52.746
We should hire your grandkids!

06:52.829 --> 06:55.957
Oh, yeah. The authorities would love that.

06:56.541 --> 06:58.126
Okay, smarty pants,

06:58.209 --> 07:01.504
if it's gonna be the two of us,
we'll never get this done by 4:30.

07:01.588 --> 07:03.465
Not with that attitude, we won't.

07:06.426 --> 07:08.345
All right. We do need help.

07:08.428 --> 07:10.388
Sorry, George.

07:10.472 --> 07:12.265
Well, now I know whose that is.

07:15.393 --> 07:16.603
Oh, yeah.

07:24.402 --> 07:25.403
Meow.

07:26.363 --> 07:27.948
Oh.

07:28.031 --> 07:31.159
You said you had your stomach thing,
but you were putting on a sexy outfit.

07:31.242 --> 07:36.331
Well, I did have my stomach thing
and then I put on my sexy outfit.

07:37.082 --> 07:41.336
Wow. Well, I was gonna wait
until it got dark outside,

07:41.419 --> 07:45.840
but, um... I also got a little something
to add to the party.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.969
I hope it's not, you know, too kinky...

07:50.387 --> 07:52.180
but... bam!

07:52.889 --> 07:54.140
Wow.

07:54.224 --> 07:57.560
What do you think? We don't have to,
you know, try it if you don't want to.

07:57.644 --> 07:59.521
-Wanna make sure everybody's comfortable--
-I love it!

07:59.604 --> 08:02.565
-You do?
-Yes! It'll be totally worth the hives.

08:02.649 --> 08:06.695
-Bud, I've never seen this side of you.
-Mmm.

08:06.778 --> 08:09.489
Are you gonna spray whipped cream
all over me, you bad boy?

08:09.572 --> 08:12.534
I... didn't get any whipped cream.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.744
What'd you get,
chocolate syrup or something?

08:15.537 --> 08:17.914
Caramel sauce? You got butterscotch?

08:17.998 --> 08:19.499
I got strawberries.

08:20.083 --> 08:21.793
Okay.

08:21.876 --> 08:25.130
So, um... like, what do we do with them?

08:25.839 --> 08:27.882
Eat them and then sex?

08:29.050 --> 08:31.886
Full disclosure, I didn't have time
to read the whole<i> Cosmo</i> article

08:31.970 --> 08:33.221
at the dentist.

08:33.304 --> 08:35.265
Oh, also, I'm supposed to spank you.

08:35.348 --> 08:36.349
Ooh.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.476
But, obviously,
we can work our way up to that.

08:38.560 --> 08:41.646
Well, now that you bring it up,
I actually brought something, too.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.023
-Oh.
-Yeah.

08:44.733 --> 08:46.151
It's from your mom's company.

08:46.234 --> 08:50.405
-Uh... my mom gave you that?
-No, that would be so weird.

08:50.488 --> 08:52.365
Your mom's partner gave it to me.

08:53.074 --> 08:57.287
I mentioned that I had carpal tunnel
and she shoved it in my purse.

08:58.246 --> 08:59.914
Is it for...

08:59.998 --> 09:03.835
It is for us to use... on me.

09:03.918 --> 09:06.838
-Oh, yeah. Cool. I know.
-Yeah. Cool.

09:06.921 --> 09:09.382
Very cool. If it's too weird for you,
we don't have to.

09:09.466 --> 09:13.261
Are you kidding me? I'm the guy
who suggested the strawberries.

09:13.344 --> 09:16.598
-Yeah, so okay, what do you think?
-Let's do this!

09:16.681 --> 09:19.309
-Do this. Yeah! Yeah!
-Yeah, yeah.

09:19.392 --> 09:23.646
You go in and, uh... I'm gonna just
Google some stuff real quick.

09:23.730 --> 09:26.441
-Okay, you go do that.
-Yeah, yeah.

09:27.567 --> 09:28.693
So?

09:29.527 --> 09:30.820
What do you think?

09:31.321 --> 09:32.739
Where is it?

09:32.822 --> 09:34.866
That's very funny.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.619
No, I love it. It's really cute.

09:37.702 --> 09:39.329
It's doll-house cute, right?

09:39.412 --> 09:43.708
Yeah. Like, if Ken got one for Barbie,
he'd get super laid.

09:43.792 --> 09:47.504
Uh, no, Ken doesn't have a penis
and Barbie's a tease.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.839
-Hey!
-Hey.

09:49.923 --> 09:51.466
I saw you through the window,

09:51.549 --> 09:54.177
so I wanted to come say hi
and bring you this. I signed for it.

09:55.178 --> 09:58.056
Oh! My prescription shampoo! Awesome!

09:59.599 --> 10:02.060
It's regular shampoo,
it just has medicine in it.

10:02.685 --> 10:04.145
Not-- There's not a problem.

10:04.229 --> 10:06.773
Some people,
they hear "prescription," they think--

10:06.856 --> 10:07.982
Hi, I'm Mallory.

10:08.066 --> 10:09.192
Hey.

10:09.275 --> 10:11.736
Yeah, Coyote's told me so much about you.

10:11.820 --> 10:14.197
And your kids. He loves those kids.

10:14.280 --> 10:15.949
Yeah, I really do.

10:16.699 --> 10:19.577
Hey, I'm gonna make some smoothies.
Mallory, quick question:

10:19.661 --> 10:21.496
-can I use your blender?
-Sure.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.622
All right.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.792
-Oh, you got any frozen yogurt?
-In the freezer.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.460
-You got any fruit?
-In the fridge.

10:27.544 --> 10:29.337
-What kind of fruit?
-Just go look.

10:30.630 --> 10:33.383
-He's a good guy.
-Yeah.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.759
I'm glad I met him when I did.

10:34.843 --> 10:37.095
Sort of marches to the beat
of his own drummer, doesn't he?

10:37.178 --> 10:38.805
Oh, yeah.

10:38.888 --> 10:42.058
I was watching you two at the meeting.
You looked very cute together.

10:42.142 --> 10:44.978
Oh! It's not like that.

10:45.061 --> 10:48.815
Okay, I've known the guy since he was five
years old and, believe me, it's like that.

10:48.898 --> 10:50.191
What?

10:50.275 --> 10:52.360
Totally. He's crazy about you.

10:53.236 --> 10:54.445
Oh.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.531
Uh...

10:57.657 --> 10:58.783
I gotta go.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.243
Wait, what?

11:00.326 --> 11:01.703
Did I just--

11:01.786 --> 11:03.663
I think you did.

11:04.581 --> 11:06.958
I need to not be here right now.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.211
Your bananas are too green!
Where are you going?

11:10.295 --> 11:13.673
There is this housewarming...

11:13.756 --> 11:17.969
I said I might stop by later,
which is now, right?

11:18.052 --> 11:20.722
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I gotta go.

11:21.389 --> 11:22.765
Wait. Nadia, wait a sec--

11:24.392 --> 11:25.977
What the hell was that?

11:26.686 --> 11:28.396
Uh...

11:28.479 --> 11:30.857
Mallory, what happened?

11:30.940 --> 11:32.817
I was just trying to be your bird dog.

11:32.901 --> 11:35.778
-My what?
-You know, guys go out,

11:35.862 --> 11:38.281
one tries to pick up a girl,
one of them's his bird dog?

11:38.364 --> 11:41.326
Oh, my God, are you trying to say
"wing man" right now?

11:42.785 --> 11:45.830
-What did you say to her?
-I just told her that you liked her.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.166
What? Are you kidding me?

11:48.249 --> 11:51.753
-I'm sorry, but you do like her, right?
-Yes. Of course I like her,

11:51.836 --> 11:54.255
-but I'm not gonna tell her that.
-Are you 15?

11:54.339 --> 11:55.882
In many ways, yes.

11:55.965 --> 11:58.176
She's new to the program, okay?

11:58.259 --> 12:01.346
She's not supposed to be
in a relationship for the first year.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.722
I was waiting.

12:02.805 --> 12:04.641
Trying to be a grown-up for once.

12:04.724 --> 12:06.643
I just wanted to help.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.520
Yeah, but now she knows,
and she can't un-know it.

12:09.604 --> 12:12.315
-I'm so sorry.
-"Sorry" doesn't fix it.

12:13.232 --> 12:16.194
Just... get off my lawn.

12:23.368 --> 12:28.915
Somehow, packing vibrators with my ex-wife
is not how I imagined my Sunday.

12:28.998 --> 12:31.209
But who knew it would be so fun?

12:32.710 --> 12:36.839
Gold star for Sol.

12:37.340 --> 12:41.302
Do you see what he's done here
and why I'm congratulating him?

12:41.386 --> 12:45.390
Look how straight his label is.
This is our goal.

12:45.473 --> 12:47.642
As opposed to...

12:48.851 --> 12:52.355
this. Now, I'm not asking who is
responsible for this abomination,

12:52.438 --> 12:58.403
but why don't you take Sol's box back out
and use it as a model.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.113
A model, wow.

13:00.196 --> 13:03.199
What can I say,
you gave very clear instructions.

13:03.282 --> 13:04.784
-Kiss ass.
-Brown-noser.

13:04.867 --> 13:07.286
Come on, get pumped, people.
We have a deadline to meet.

13:07.370 --> 13:09.706
Oh, now you're concerned about deadlines?

13:09.789 --> 13:13.126
But when it's 11:55
and Del Taco's about to close,

13:13.209 --> 13:15.420
where is your concern then, Grace?

13:15.503 --> 13:17.839
This is more important
than "second dinner."

13:18.548 --> 13:23.094
Every label represents a customer
who's responded to our product.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.096
Doesn't that excite you? Whoo!

13:26.097 --> 13:27.849
Can we at least take a coffee break?

13:27.932 --> 13:30.601
I don't need coffee.
I'm energized by the work.

13:30.685 --> 13:32.020
Whoo!

13:33.563 --> 13:34.731
Whoo!

13:37.358 --> 13:39.777
- I miss you!
- I know you do!

13:40.778 --> 13:43.448
Yeah, I really brought the ruckus. Oh!

13:50.371 --> 13:52.206
Hey, I'm starving. You hungry?

13:52.915 --> 13:55.043
I bet you are.

13:55.126 --> 13:56.669
I'll whip up something for you.

13:56.753 --> 13:57.587
Um...

13:58.087 --> 14:00.131
Gluten-free pancakes?

14:00.214 --> 14:02.759
I'd throw some strawberries on there
if I hadn't eaten them all.

14:02.842 --> 14:04.135
Sorry about that.

14:04.218 --> 14:06.888
Ended up needing the energy, though,
am I right, babe?

14:07.555 --> 14:08.556
Right, babe?

14:10.058 --> 14:11.184
Quick scramble?

14:12.894 --> 14:13.728
Babe?

14:16.439 --> 14:17.690
Allison?

14:32.955 --> 14:33.831
Whoa.

14:33.915 --> 14:37.210
If I'd known you were as good at this
as you were at stealing my husband,

14:37.293 --> 14:39.128
I would've gone into business with you.

14:39.212 --> 14:41.631
He actually made the first move.

14:43.007 --> 14:44.967
You know, we don't need
to talk about this.

14:45.051 --> 14:46.886
No, we don't.

14:46.969 --> 14:51.015
If you recall, the last time we huddled
around a computer together,

14:51.099 --> 14:54.268
we were courting
a mustachioed mystery man.

14:54.352 --> 14:58.022
We were young then. We're wiser now.

14:58.106 --> 14:59.941
So, no new moustaches?

15:00.024 --> 15:01.150
Just Frankie's.

15:02.110 --> 15:04.654
Not much for water-cooler talk,
are you, boss?

15:04.737 --> 15:06.697
I like that you call me "Boss."

15:06.781 --> 15:08.783
Come on, we can take a tiny break.

15:08.866 --> 15:11.577
I hear there's a Singles Night
at the Senior Center--

15:11.661 --> 15:13.955
No. End of discussion.

15:16.040 --> 15:19.127
But eventually,
don't you want to date again?

15:19.836 --> 15:20.753
Sol...

15:20.837 --> 15:22.964
I just think you deserve to be happy!

15:23.047 --> 15:25.007
I am happy.

15:25.091 --> 15:26.801
I've got Vybrant. I've got Frankie,

15:26.884 --> 15:30.721
who finally has gotten over her fear
of the garbage disposal.

15:31.305 --> 15:32.598
This is enough for me.

15:32.682 --> 15:36.519
Of course. I totally respect that
and I'm really glad to hear you say it.

15:37.395 --> 15:42.316
Of course, Freud believed that it's love
which defines humanity.

15:42.400 --> 15:45.027
The same Freud that diagnosed me
with penis envy?

15:45.111 --> 15:46.737
They weren't all hits.

15:46.821 --> 15:51.451
But he did say you need
both work and love to be happy.

15:51.534 --> 15:54.954
Yeah? Then why did you retire?

15:56.456 --> 15:57.790
I have no idea.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.209
Break's over.

16:04.046 --> 16:06.048
You know, we could just make a run for it.

16:06.883 --> 16:09.635
Are you a good swimmer?
We could be in Japan in a year.

16:09.719 --> 16:11.345
Actually, I'm a very good swimmer.

16:11.429 --> 16:14.182
I'm not, I'll just have to piggyback it.

16:15.475 --> 16:18.019
I know why I hate this stuff,

16:18.102 --> 16:21.647
but you seem to hate this stuff
and it's actually your stuff.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.983
I just pictured myself on the front lines,

16:24.066 --> 16:26.569
handing vibrators out to the masses,

16:26.652 --> 16:29.530
mobilizing nursing homes,
that kind of thing.

16:29.614 --> 16:33.284
Ah! Reality can be a stark departure
from fantasy.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.203
Get me that on a hat.

16:35.286 --> 16:38.039
Although, that's a lot of words,
get me two hats.

16:38.122 --> 16:41.667
You know, when I got out of law school
I thought I'd be like Perry Mason.

16:41.751 --> 16:44.962
You know, winning all those dramatic cases
at the last moment,

16:45.046 --> 16:48.633
holding the entire courtroom in my thrall.

16:48.716 --> 16:51.302
At least you've got two working legs.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.887
You're thinking of<i> Ironside.</i>

16:52.970 --> 16:54.972
Why am I confused here?

16:55.056 --> 16:57.266
Same actor. Raymond Burr.

16:58.518 --> 17:00.061
Does this look like Sol's?

17:00.478 --> 17:02.688
I guess if you tilt it.

17:03.314 --> 17:07.026
What do I know?
I'm not a box genius, like Sol and Grace.

17:07.109 --> 17:09.153
How do you know? You've only done two.

17:09.237 --> 17:12.073
-Lay off me, man.
-Okay.

17:14.992 --> 17:16.827
It's Jacob. What do I say?

17:16.911 --> 17:18.079
"Hello, Jacob"?

17:18.162 --> 17:20.039
Good. I like that.

17:20.665 --> 17:22.291
Hello, Jacob.

17:23.042 --> 17:25.419
I know. I'm so sorry.

17:25.503 --> 17:27.755
I don't think I can make it.

17:29.215 --> 17:33.678
Of course I want to talk to you about it.
I'm not avoiding you, I promise.

17:33.761 --> 17:35.972
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

17:36.055 --> 17:40.935
Oh, unless, of course, Grace has a bunch
of these boxes she wants me to finish.

17:41.894 --> 17:44.981
Okay. Okay, bye-bye.

17:48.526 --> 17:50.236
Everything okay over there?

17:51.862 --> 17:53.990
Sorry. None of my business.

17:54.657 --> 17:58.244
Unless I make it your business
because I need to get it off my chest.

17:59.787 --> 18:04.125
Jacob is selling the farm and moving to
New Mexico and he wants me to go with him.

18:05.251 --> 18:06.419
New Mexico?

18:06.502 --> 18:07.878
I know.

18:09.088 --> 18:10.339
Are you thinking about it?

18:10.423 --> 18:12.300
I am thinking about it.

18:13.217 --> 18:14.844
But I don't know.

18:14.927 --> 18:19.557
On the one hand I've got my life here
with Grace, my boys, our business.

18:19.640 --> 18:23.978
And on the other there's Jacob
with a whole new adventure.

18:25.313 --> 18:26.564
Have you talked to Grace?

18:26.647 --> 18:29.942
Oh, no. I can't talk to her
till I figure it out.

18:30.026 --> 18:34.530
But I usually figure things out with her.
So it's a brain-buster.

18:35.448 --> 18:36.532
I get that.

18:37.283 --> 18:40.620
But you're gonna have to tell her
sooner rather than later.

18:40.703 --> 18:45.333
Take it from a man who told her later
and really wishes he told her sooner.

18:45.416 --> 18:47.251
Can I tell her when she's asleep?

18:48.002 --> 18:51.380
Or under the hair dryer,
or general anesthesia?

18:52.048 --> 18:54.258
Frankie, get in here!

18:54.634 --> 18:56.135
Oh, God, she heard us.

18:56.218 --> 18:58.262
-You think she heard us?
-No.

18:58.346 --> 18:59.847
Be cool.

19:00.556 --> 19:01.932
Right behind you, kid.

19:05.353 --> 19:07.480
So, time for lunch yet?

19:07.563 --> 19:09.190
Unbelievable!

19:09.273 --> 19:10.650
I'm hungry.

19:10.733 --> 19:13.277
Someone is ripping off our vibrator.

19:13.361 --> 19:15.279
Arlene just sent me an article.

19:15.363 --> 19:18.908
a design geared for the older woman,

19:18.991 --> 19:23.746
with a gel sleeve, an adjustable head
and glow in the dark buttons."

19:23.829 --> 19:25.373
Oh, that's what we're doing!

19:25.456 --> 19:27.041
That's my point.

19:27.124 --> 19:29.043
It's what Hydrox did to Oreos.

19:29.126 --> 19:31.379
We've been Hydroxed!

19:31.462 --> 19:35.549
Actually, Hydrox was invented first,
in 1908.

19:35.633 --> 19:39.095
-And, in fact, Oreo was the one--
-I forgot you were a cookie historian.

19:39.178 --> 19:42.306
Well, they can't do that.
Wait, who's they?

19:42.390 --> 19:45.851
-Some company called Sex Tech.
-Never heard of them.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.728
It's a division of Omni Tech.

19:47.812 --> 19:50.106
Oh, they made my boom box.

19:50.189 --> 19:53.275
This is bad, Frankie.
We might have to sue them.

19:53.359 --> 19:55.986
Wait a minute, hold on.
You do not want to do that.

19:56.070 --> 19:59.365
They have a lot of money.
They have lawyers for their lawyers.

19:59.448 --> 20:01.992
He's right.
It could tie you up in court for years.

20:02.076 --> 20:04.578
Years? Would I have to be here for that?

20:04.662 --> 20:06.706
Why wouldn't you be here?

20:09.709 --> 20:11.210
What kind of look is that?

20:12.503 --> 20:14.255
What look?

20:14.338 --> 20:18.092
The look you just gave him
and the one he gave you back.

20:18.968 --> 20:20.886
Oh, my God, did you know about this?

20:20.970 --> 20:22.138
No.

20:22.221 --> 20:24.265
Grace, I would have told you.

20:24.348 --> 20:26.892
Yeah, like when my breast was out
at Jamba Juice?

20:26.976 --> 20:28.894
Maybe we should let these two talk.

20:28.978 --> 20:31.272
Talk about what, Robert?

20:31.355 --> 20:34.066
If the looks weren't looks,
what is there to talk about?

20:34.859 --> 20:35.818
Frankie?

20:39.655 --> 20:41.407
It's not about the article.

20:42.408 --> 20:43.993
Well, then what's it about?

20:45.161 --> 20:46.996
Santa Fe.

20:49.874 --> 20:51.917
Thank you
for being so brave, Brendan.

20:52.001 --> 20:53.627
Would anyone else like to share?

20:58.382 --> 21:01.260
Hi, I'm Nadia.
I'm an alcoholic/addict.

21:01.343 --> 21:02.803
Hi, Nadia.

21:03.846 --> 21:05.765
And I had a really hard day.

21:07.057 --> 21:11.479
This guy I know apparently has feelings
for me and it freaked me out.

21:13.063 --> 21:15.941
I think because
I have feelings for him, too.

21:17.401 --> 21:20.613
In the past, I would've ripped this guy's
pants off in the middle of the street,

21:20.696 --> 21:22.031
done him right there.

21:22.114 --> 21:24.283
And then, I would have ripped him off.

21:26.285 --> 21:29.622
But this was my first time
in this situation sober

21:30.206 --> 21:32.291
and I didn't know how to handle it.

21:36.086 --> 21:37.630
He's a nice guy...

21:38.589 --> 21:40.549
and I've never been with one of those.

21:41.550 --> 21:44.136
But maybe, in the future...

21:45.179 --> 21:48.182
over time, and if he's patient...

21:51.018 --> 21:51.894
who knows.

21:59.109 --> 22:00.694
She likes me.

22:04.949 --> 22:06.784
Are the eggs okay?

22:06.867 --> 22:09.078
Yeah, they're delicious. Why?

22:09.787 --> 22:12.414
I don't know. You don't seem
to be making that much noise.

22:13.249 --> 22:14.333
I'm sorry.

22:15.000 --> 22:16.627
Mmm!

22:17.294 --> 22:18.879
Are you sure you don't mean...

22:22.591 --> 22:24.218
What is the matter with you?

22:25.761 --> 22:28.848
After we were done, when I came
to the kitchen, you stayed in the bedroom,

22:28.931 --> 22:31.475
and made that noise.

22:31.559 --> 22:34.061
Oh. That was because of the vibrator.

22:34.144 --> 22:36.063
But I thought we were...

22:36.146 --> 22:38.857
I thought you were... completed.

22:38.941 --> 22:41.235
I was! I totally was.

22:41.318 --> 22:44.238
I just... took another spin
around the old block.

22:44.905 --> 22:48.409
But that sound you were making was way
different from the sound you make with me.

22:49.660 --> 22:52.663
-And?
-Does that mean it's better?

22:53.455 --> 22:55.708
They were just two different experiences.

22:55.791 --> 22:56.876
Like surf and turf.

22:56.959 --> 22:58.961
Surf and turf is one experience
by definition.

22:59.044 --> 23:01.171
-Not the way I eat it.
-You're not answering the question.

23:02.506 --> 23:04.508
I had an amazing time with you.

23:04.592 --> 23:06.594
That was some of the best sex
that we've ever had.

23:06.677 --> 23:08.512
Why don't you make that sound with me?

23:08.596 --> 23:11.348
No, it has nothing to do with you.

23:11.432 --> 23:12.683
It's just...

23:13.350 --> 23:15.686
It's a perfectly designed machine.

23:16.687 --> 23:18.689
Okay. I get it.

23:19.481 --> 23:20.524
You're well-designed, too.

23:20.608 --> 23:23.360
Okay, okay.
Enough with the adorable bullshit.

23:23.444 --> 23:25.613
Don't be mad at the vibrator.

23:26.322 --> 23:29.992
When I'm with you, it's beautiful
and it really means something.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.161
You don't have to say that, but thanks.

23:32.244 --> 23:33.954
You're welcome.

23:34.038 --> 23:36.373
Oh, I have to go home.
I gotta feed Gregory.

23:36.707 --> 23:38.375
Can you please stop worrying?

23:45.633 --> 23:47.885
-Give me one more shot.
-What?

23:47.968 --> 23:51.847
Give me a chance to beat the machine.

23:52.806 --> 23:56.560
You know, there's been an awful lot
of attention on me today.

23:57.603 --> 23:59.438
Let me try a little something.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.614
Jacob is moving to Santa Fe.

24:08.697 --> 24:10.449
What?

24:10.532 --> 24:11.867
His kids are there.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.619
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

24:13.702 --> 24:15.621
He asked me to go with him.

24:16.914 --> 24:18.165
Wh...

24:18.248 --> 24:21.919
-You're not thinking of going?
-I don't know.

24:22.002 --> 24:24.296
I mean, there are
a million things to think about.

24:25.547 --> 24:27.716
-When is he moving?
-I don't know.

24:27.800 --> 24:30.427
-Then when would you have--
-I don't know that either.

24:30.511 --> 24:32.846
Nothing has been decided yet.

24:35.683 --> 24:37.810
Well, since you don't know anything,

24:37.893 --> 24:42.398
I have at least 400 vibrators to box.

24:42.481 --> 24:44.817
Four hundred and one.

24:46.235 --> 24:47.903
Can we talk about this, please?

24:47.986 --> 24:50.322
Can you print some more labels, please?

24:51.240 --> 24:52.908
-Grace--
-No!

24:53.325 --> 24:57.037
I can't...
I can't talk about this right now.

24:57.121 --> 24:58.914
So, label, label, label.

24:58.997 --> 25:01.959
And please, would you put the paper in
right-side up this time.

25:05.879 --> 25:06.880
What are you doing?

25:06.964 --> 25:10.342
I'm knocking on your walls, Grace.
I'm gonna find a way in.

25:10.426 --> 25:12.177
Where's the door? Show me a window.

25:12.261 --> 25:14.680
Frankie, is this how
you want to be murdered?

25:15.347 --> 25:19.852
Looks like I'll just shimmy over the top
and come through the chimney.

25:23.897 --> 25:26.608
Please talk to me. This is a big deal.

25:26.692 --> 25:28.610
For both of us.

25:30.195 --> 25:31.405
Excuse me.

25:32.573 --> 25:35.284
I'm just thinking about
what I want for the rest of my life.

25:35.367 --> 25:37.828
-Don't you ever think about that?
-Yeah.

25:37.911 --> 25:40.330
What do you see
when you visualize your future?

25:41.123 --> 25:42.791
Zero boxes in my house.

25:42.875 --> 25:46.128
I picture myself in a hot air balloon.

25:46.211 --> 25:48.297
Oh, wait a minute, I've changed my answer.

25:48.964 --> 25:52.509
When I picture my life,
I'm holding a giant pin.

25:52.593 --> 25:56.597
No, really. I want to fly freely.
I want to soar.

25:56.680 --> 25:59.558
I want a big life that encompasses
many different things.

25:59.641 --> 26:04.855
Oh, congratulations, you dream about
being a flying human fruit basket.

26:04.938 --> 26:07.483
Talk to me. This is important.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.651
This is important, too.

26:10.736 --> 26:14.198
Look, if you're not gonna help,
the least you can do is not slow me down.

26:14.281 --> 26:16.366
-I can help.
-No.

26:16.992 --> 26:20.245
Obviously, you have
a lot to think about. So go think.

26:20.329 --> 26:21.747
I'm fine.

26:29.546 --> 26:33.133
We'll talk about this in the morning...
I guess.

26:34.092 --> 26:35.260
Yeah.

27:37.698 --> 27:39.199
<i>Okay, good night.</i>
