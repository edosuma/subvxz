00:00.567 --> 00:02.201
      I am Elizabeth Smart.

00:02.336 --> 00:04.636
      Perhaps you remember
            my story.

00:04.805 --> 00:06.372
<i>Tonight,</i>
   <i> we begin.</i>

00:06.507 --> 00:09.174
    <i> Elizabeth was found this</i>
  <i> afternoon in good condition.</i>

00:09.310 --> 00:12.077
   <i> Elizabeth was 14 years old</i>
    <i> when she was kidnapped-</i>

00:12.213 --> 00:13.746
      <i> From her bedroom in</i>
    <i> the middle of the night-</i>

00:13.848 --> 00:15.647
    <i> She was raped each day.</i>

00:15.750 --> 00:16.849
        <i> He tied her up-</i>

00:16.951 --> 00:18.217
     <i> Plied her with alcohol</i>
           <i> and drugs-</i>

00:18.319 --> 00:19.785
  <i> Forced her into a polygamous</i>
           <i> marriage-</i>

00:19.920 --> 00:22.221
 <i> Repeatedly threatened to kill</i>
      <i> her and her family.</i>

00:22.323 --> 00:25.124
    <i> The odds were certainly</i>
     <i> against this reunion.</i>

00:25.226 --> 00:27.793
    <i> Less than two percent of</i>
 <i> long-term missing child cases</i>

00:27.895 --> 00:30.262
    <i> are resolved by finding</i>
        <i> the child alive.</i>

00:32.867 --> 00:35.367
      <i> I know you've heard</i>
      <i> all of this before,</i>

00:35.436 --> 00:36.735
     and maybe you've asked
          the questions

00:36.837 --> 00:38.037
     <i> "why didn't you run?"</i>

00:38.139 --> 00:39.338
    <i> "Why didn't you scream?"</i>

00:39.440 --> 00:41.507
      <i> "Why did you not try</i>
          <i> to escape?"</i>

00:41.609 --> 00:46.378
       <i> Everything I did,</i>
       <i> I did to survive.</i>

00:46.480 --> 00:49.048
 You may think you know my story

00:49.150 --> 00:50.816
   but the truth is you don't.

00:50.951 --> 00:52.518
          Not from me.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.153
      <i> Don't make a sound.</i>

00:54.288 --> 00:56.855
    <i> Get up and come with me</i>
       <i> or I will kill you</i>

00:56.957 --> 00:59.358
  <i> and I will kill your family.</i>

00:59.493 --> 01:02.027
  <i> I have a knife at your neck.</i>

01:02.129 --> 01:05.497
  Get out of bed now or I will
    kill your little sister.

01:25.186 --> 01:26.418
        Grab your shoes.

01:28.089 --> 01:29.088
           No, those.

01:29.190 --> 01:30.522
      We're going outside?

01:30.624 --> 01:31.990
     I'm taking you hostage.

01:35.729 --> 01:39.398
          Not a sound,
        or they're dead.

01:39.500 --> 01:40.933
       Your family's dead.

01:44.371 --> 01:46.271
     Quickest way out, now.

01:59.320 --> 02:00.152
       Put your shoes on.

02:00.254 --> 02:01.220
          Put them on.

02:07.361 --> 02:08.360
            Let's go.

02:15.469 --> 02:16.101
              Hey!

02:16.203 --> 02:19.037
        Help me, please!

02:19.106 --> 02:20.372
   If you move or make a sound
          I'll kill you

02:20.474 --> 02:23.408
  and go back for your sister.

02:23.511 --> 02:24.610
    This is the work of God.

02:24.712 --> 02:27.146
      Let this cop car pass
       without finding us.

02:32.586 --> 02:34.086
             Get up.

02:34.188 --> 02:36.021
     Why are you doing this?

02:36.157 --> 02:37.256
    I haven't done anything.

02:37.324 --> 02:38.991
               Go!

02:39.093 --> 02:40.025
         What did I do?

02:40.127 --> 02:41.660
         Please, don't.

02:52.606 --> 02:54.806
 Please, if you're going to kill
      me do it here please

02:54.875 --> 02:56.441
    so someone will find me.

03:09.957 --> 03:11.557
        If you let me go
      I'll tell my parents

03:11.692 --> 03:13.225
     not to call the police.

03:14.828 --> 03:18.263
   One word and my people will
  kill everyone in your house.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.933
   If you run I will kill you.

03:21.035 --> 03:23.502
   If you do anything I don't
         tell you to do,

03:23.604 --> 03:25.103
       then your blood is
         on your hands.

03:25.206 --> 03:27.039
       Do you understand?

03:27.141 --> 03:27.706
       Do you understand?

03:30.044 --> 03:31.310
             Get up!

03:31.412 --> 03:32.277
           Go! Get up!

03:47.294 --> 03:48.660
           Hephzibah.

03:48.729 --> 03:49.928
            Immanuel.

04:31.105 --> 04:34.339
     Take off your pajamas.

04:34.441 --> 04:35.641
               No.

04:35.743 --> 04:39.811
      You must be cleansed
   for the celestial marriage.

04:39.913 --> 04:40.846
          Put this on.

04:43.350 --> 04:44.449
               No.

04:59.400 --> 05:03.135
         Take them off.

05:03.270 --> 05:05.003
    Take off your underwear.

05:05.105 --> 05:06.738
               No.

05:06.840 --> 05:07.873
               No.

05:07.975 --> 05:11.476
     Take off your underwear

05:11.545 --> 05:16.248
 or I will have him come in here
        and rip them off.

05:24.124 --> 05:27.326
      I can't... I can't...

06:14.341 --> 06:16.608
       Please... please...

06:19.146 --> 06:21.913
        I seal you to me
         on this Earth.

06:22.049 --> 06:27.552
  What is sealed here on Earth
will be sealed in the afterlife.

06:27.654 --> 06:30.355
              No...

06:30.457 --> 06:31.857
     I take you as my wife-

06:31.959 --> 06:32.924
             No. NO!

06:33.026 --> 06:34.426
   Before God and his angels-

06:34.528 --> 06:37.696
             No! NO!

06:37.798 --> 06:38.497
       ...as my witnesses.

06:38.599 --> 06:40.632
             NO!!!!!

06:40.768 --> 06:41.500
      If you scream again,
    I'll duct tape your mouth

06:41.635 --> 06:42.467
     and then I'll kill you.

06:44.972 --> 06:46.538
          Wait, please!

06:46.607 --> 06:48.707
       I'm still a child!

06:48.776 --> 06:51.209
        I haven't started
         my period yet!

06:51.345 --> 06:53.412
No! No!
   Please Stop!

06:53.514 --> 06:55.847
           No! NO!!!!!

06:55.949 --> 06:56.782
          <i> Wait! Wait!</i>

06:56.884 --> 06:57.916
             <i> Wait!</i>

06:58.051 --> 06:59.851
     Do you want it to stop?

06:59.987 --> 07:02.687
            So did I.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.222
       I tried everything.

07:04.324 --> 07:08.026
         I tried so hard
       to protect myself.

07:08.162 --> 07:09.661
    I rolled onto my stomach

07:09.763 --> 07:12.697
  thinking that he wouldn't be
        able to hurt me,

07:12.766 --> 07:15.500
  thinking that he wouldn't be
        able to rape me.

07:15.602 --> 07:17.869
           But he did.

07:17.971 --> 07:20.138
And afterwards I'll never forget
           how I felt.

07:20.240 --> 07:21.206
        I felt so broken.

07:21.308 --> 07:23.008
      I felt so shattered,

07:23.076 --> 07:24.042
  like I had just been smashed

07:24.144 --> 07:25.811
       into a million tiny
          little pieces

07:25.946 --> 07:28.146
  and nobody could ever put me
         back together.

07:28.282 --> 07:33.251
  I remember thinking maybe it
 would be better if I was dead.

08:56.703 --> 09:00.705
  <i> That safety pin was the only</i>
     <i> thing I had from home,</i>

09:00.841 --> 09:05.443
 <i> but it was enough to remind me</i>
    <i> that I was loved always.</i>

09:27.367 --> 09:32.304
  <i> The spirit of the lord, God,</i>
           <i> is upon me</i>

09:32.406 --> 09:34.839
      <i> 'cause the lord hath</i>
          <i> anointed me</i>

09:34.975 --> 09:37.175
  <i> to preach good tidings unto</i>
           <i> the meek,</i>

09:37.277 --> 09:41.646
   <i> he has sent me to bind up</i>
      <i> the broken hearted.</i>

09:41.782 --> 09:45.617
      <i> To proclaim liberty</i>
        <i> to the captives</i>

09:45.686 --> 09:51.089
 <i> and the opening of the prison</i>
    <i> to them that are bound.</i>

09:51.191 --> 09:54.726
   <i> To proclaim the acceptable</i>
        <i> year of the lord</i>

09:54.861 --> 09:59.331
    and the day of vengeance
           of our god.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.437
     Comfort all that mourn.

10:28.729 --> 10:31.496
   You are lucky, Shearjashub.

10:35.268 --> 10:40.605
You have been called by the lord
   to be saved from the world.

10:45.012 --> 10:47.012
       I- I remember you.

10:52.252 --> 10:54.285
   <i> My mother gave you money.</i>

11:06.266 --> 11:12.003
   <i> My father gave you a job.</i>

11:12.139 --> 11:14.272
     <i> He tried to help you.</i>

11:14.374 --> 11:20.545
         <i> So did my mom.</i>

11:20.681 --> 11:25.283
     Why would you do this?

11:25.385 --> 11:30.989
    The lord is ready to bear
       a force, his army.

11:31.124 --> 11:37.529
      Destruction is coming
          Shearjashub.

11:37.664 --> 11:39.664
      I'm Elizabeth Smart.

11:39.800 --> 11:43.535
          God called me
       into the wilderness

11:43.704 --> 11:46.171
        and instructed me
          his prophet,

11:46.273 --> 11:48.006
     Immanuel David Isaiah,

11:48.075 --> 11:50.742
       to begin preparing
     for the second coming.

11:50.877 --> 11:53.645
      The lord commanded me
   to pluck the young virgins

11:53.747 --> 11:57.182
  from this evil world and take
        them as my wives.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.417
  I have no choice but to obey.

11:59.519 --> 12:01.186
              Amen.

12:01.288 --> 12:04.255
   Your presence is proof that
    the lord God almighty has

12:04.357 --> 12:07.292
         opened the way
         for more wives.

12:07.394 --> 12:10.962
       You are blessed you
         are the first.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.198
      After me, of course.

12:13.366 --> 12:16.334
   Hephzibah Elladah Isaiah's
 first wife and mother of Zion,

12:16.436 --> 12:19.637
     you Shearjashub Isaiah
    are now second wife to me

12:19.740 --> 12:21.239
         and handmaiden
          to Hephzibah-

12:21.341 --> 12:22.140
       I'm not your wife,
       we're not married!

12:22.242 --> 12:23.942
           We're not!

12:24.010 --> 12:26.010
             We are.

12:26.113 --> 12:28.747
      We've consummated it.

12:28.815 --> 12:29.547
          Which means-

12:31.251 --> 12:33.818
    No man will want you now.

12:33.954 --> 12:36.755
            Yes, yes.

12:36.857 --> 12:38.757
      We are bound forever.

12:38.892 --> 12:43.728
     You are mine to fulfill
       every bodily need.

12:43.830 --> 12:44.729
             Please.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.464
   Please don't do that again.

12:46.566 --> 12:50.401
      You did it once, once
     consummates it, right?

12:50.537 --> 12:53.037
    We are husband and wife.

12:53.140 --> 12:57.909
     I- I can be your wife,
    at home with my parents-

12:59.946 --> 13:01.679
     We are your family now!

13:04.718 --> 13:09.053
 God commands me to show you all
  the low things of the world.

13:21.902 --> 13:25.937
       Take off your robe.

13:26.039 --> 13:29.207
    Hephzibah will teach you.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.976
     And then you'll show us
      what you've learned.

13:36.650 --> 13:37.482
            Wake up!

13:37.617 --> 13:39.951
    Who wants to watch that?

13:40.086 --> 13:41.319
            I didn't.

13:41.421 --> 13:45.190
  I was raped every single day.

13:45.325 --> 13:49.027
   Sometimes twice a day, and
  it was every bit as horrific

13:49.129 --> 13:50.962
       as you can imagine.

14:03.009 --> 14:07.445
   The lord told me you would
  resist at first, Shearjashub,

14:07.547 --> 14:09.881
    but then you would learn
           to love it.

14:09.983 --> 14:12.650
   Learn to obey your husband.

14:14.855 --> 14:17.689
 Or he will dispatch the warring
      angels to your house

14:17.791 --> 14:20.525
          and lay waste
         to the sinners

14:20.627 --> 14:22.794
     who would lure you off
       God's chosen path.

14:22.896 --> 14:24.629
         Do you hear me?

14:27.000 --> 14:28.333
             Do you?

14:31.571 --> 14:33.972
 'Cause it looked like you were
 thinking about something else.

14:36.042 --> 14:38.009
    Are you gonna lie to me?!

14:38.178 --> 14:40.378
             No- no.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.914
      I was just confused.

14:43.016 --> 14:45.583
 You're calling me Shearjashub.

14:45.685 --> 14:46.551
         I'm Elizabeth.

14:46.620 --> 14:49.020
               No!

14:49.122 --> 14:53.658
You're not what you were before.

14:53.760 --> 14:57.095
      You are Shearjashub,

14:57.197 --> 15:00.164
  named for the first-born son
           of Isaiah.

15:00.267 --> 15:04.969
 It means a remnant will return.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.971
   But- but it's a boy's name.

15:12.212 --> 15:14.979
    Can I pick a middle name?

15:15.081 --> 15:16.047
          Like you two?

15:16.182 --> 15:19.684
     I don't wanna be called
          a boy's name.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.753
            Alright.

15:21.855 --> 15:24.889
   You can pick a middle name.

15:24.991 --> 15:28.493
   But it cannot be Elizabeth.

15:28.595 --> 15:31.195
       It has to come from
       the Old Testament.

15:45.679 --> 15:47.946
             Esther.

15:48.048 --> 15:50.315
  I'd like to be called Esther.

15:50.417 --> 15:52.016
         A girl's name.

15:54.220 --> 15:56.821
             Esther.

15:56.990 --> 16:00.458
 The second wife and orphan that
  the king plucked for himself

16:00.560 --> 16:02.694
          and re-named.

16:02.796 --> 16:07.298
  Yes, I will call you Esther.

16:07.434 --> 16:10.101
   So you remember your place.

16:14.975 --> 16:18.376
  Remember your place, Esther.

16:20.413 --> 16:23.081
     <i> I chose Esther because</i>
      <i> she won in the end.</i>

16:23.216 --> 16:25.984
  <i> She outsmarted the king and</i>
    <i> she didn't use a sword,</i>

16:26.086 --> 16:29.387
  <i> she used different weapons,</i>
        <i> just as I would.</i>

16:29.489 --> 16:35.159
    Brian David Mitchell took
      so much away from me

16:35.295 --> 16:40.965
 but what he didn't realize was
 that I was determined to live.

16:51.945 --> 16:55.380
<i>I was so determined to get back</i>
          <i> to my family</i>

16:55.448 --> 16:58.349
     <i> that I actually helped</i>
           <i> my captors</i>

16:58.451 --> 17:00.918
  <i> because when people like you</i>
      <i> it's harder for them</i>

17:01.021 --> 17:04.321
          <i> to kill you.</i>

17:04.424 --> 17:06.057
           Can I help?

17:19.906 --> 17:23.907
   What do you want me to do?

17:24.010 --> 17:26.044
       Grate the carrots.

17:33.486 --> 17:38.423
 I usually prepare meals myself,
           on my own,

17:38.525 --> 17:40.558
         as first wife.

17:40.693 --> 17:45.630
     Oh, I don't want to be
           first wife.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.765
    I thought I was supposed
          to help you.

17:47.867 --> 17:50.701
     I can stop if you want.

17:56.810 --> 17:59.610
     She didn't need to move
           the knife.

17:59.746 --> 18:01.045
        I was chained up.

18:01.181 --> 18:02.914
     If I tried to hurt her

18:03.016 --> 18:06.350
      I would have received
        it back ten fold.

18:06.486 --> 18:09.387
               Ok.

18:09.556 --> 18:13.458
   I got that recipe in Oregon
      at a homeless shelter

18:13.593 --> 18:15.726
   after the lord commanded us
         to sell our RV

18:15.862 --> 18:17.962
     and everything we owned
   and live with the homeless.

18:18.064 --> 18:19.597
     The food was terrible.

18:19.699 --> 18:21.499
  It was not what we deserved,
      so I said to myself,

18:21.634 --> 18:28.473
 I said Hephzibah bake something
   sweet, so I added raisins.

18:28.641 --> 18:32.877
  <i> Wanda Barzee is the scariest</i>
     <i> woman I have ever met.</i>

18:32.979 --> 18:35.947
  <i> She is so evil she took her</i>
     <i> daughter's pet rabbit</i>

18:36.049 --> 18:38.349
       <i> and fed it to her.</i>

18:38.451 --> 18:40.985
   <i> She delighted in my abuse.</i>

18:41.121 --> 18:44.255
   One time while I was being
  raped she sat there and said

18:44.357 --> 18:48.793
      "if God commands it,
         it's not evil".

18:48.928 --> 18:53.865
   The lord called upon me to
   devote myself to Immanuel.

18:53.967 --> 18:55.933
       You cannot disobey.

18:56.035 --> 19:00.671
        Children services
     couldn't see his light.

19:00.773 --> 19:05.176
  Made me sign away all my kids
     the day I married him.

19:05.311 --> 19:07.278
    That's my cross to bear.

19:09.916 --> 19:11.282
 Why're you just sittin' there?

19:11.384 --> 19:12.250
        I- I'm sorry, I-

19:12.385 --> 19:14.819
Can't you read the instructions?

19:14.954 --> 19:16.320
           I'm sorry.

19:33.373 --> 19:38.809
     How dare you eat before
     I've blessed the food?

19:38.912 --> 19:40.811
     You will not eat today.

19:40.947 --> 19:44.448
    Get on your knees and beg
     the lord's forgiveness.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.723
     We live thy will, lord.

19:52.825 --> 19:57.061
 Bless and consecrate this meal
       that your servants

19:57.197 --> 20:00.932
      Hephzibah and Esther,
   handmaiden and second wife,

20:01.067 --> 20:04.635
   have lovingly prepared for
    their husband and master.

20:04.771 --> 20:06.137
<i> Elizabeth.</i>

20:06.272 --> 20:08.072
    Who you have commanded me
            to take,

20:08.174 --> 20:09.574
  who I will bring low, lord...

20:09.676 --> 20:11.375
<i> Elizabeth?</i>

20:11.477 --> 20:13.544
           <i> Elizabeth?</i>

20:13.680 --> 20:14.378
           Uncle Dave?

20:14.480 --> 20:17.949
           Uncle Dave?

20:18.084 --> 20:19.750
           <i> Elizabeth!</i>

20:19.886 --> 20:21.419
        <i> Can you hear us?</i>

20:21.521 --> 20:23.120
           <i> Elizabeth?</i>

20:25.558 --> 20:32.163
  You yell and I will take that
 knife and slit his throat open.

20:32.265 --> 20:36.167
   If he comes into this camp
           he's dead.

20:36.302 --> 20:38.769
     If anyone steps foot in
   this camp I will kill them,

20:38.871 --> 20:40.905
       do you understand?

20:53.686 --> 20:55.653
       Good girl, Esther.

21:01.594 --> 21:03.527
I did anything and everything
            for them

21:03.696 --> 21:06.564
     and then the LDS church
    tries to excommunicate me

21:06.699 --> 21:08.699
      when they get a copy?

21:08.768 --> 21:10.201
        But I beat them.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.335
          I beat them.

21:11.437 --> 21:13.004
      Satan worked through
          our families.

21:13.072 --> 21:13.971
              They-

21:14.073 --> 21:15.473
      The book of Immanuel
          David Isaiah,

21:15.575 --> 21:17.241
    the word of God almighty,

21:17.343 --> 21:19.243
      we should read to you
         like a bible...

21:27.220 --> 21:31.022
<i> Help me!</i>

21:40.233 --> 21:43.934
     <i> Every day in every way</i>
         <i> he had proved</i>

21:44.070 --> 21:47.338
       <i> that he was always</i>
         <i> one step ahead</i>

21:47.473 --> 21:49.006
 and that's why I believed him.

21:49.142 --> 21:53.277
    Not because I was a naive
           14-year-old

21:53.346 --> 21:57.448
    but because he always got
         what he wanted.

22:19.539 --> 22:22.173
    <i> I knew people were still</i>
         <i> looking for me</i>

22:22.308 --> 22:26.344
   <i> and I knew that my parents</i>
      <i> would never give up</i>

22:26.412 --> 22:31.282
    <i> but still, after a week</i>
            <i> went by</i>

22:31.384 --> 22:34.452
        <i> and no one came,</i>

22:34.554 --> 22:39.590
   <i> it showed me just how good</i>
 <i> Brian Mitchell was at hiding.</i>

22:51.237 --> 22:52.503
          Sweep it up.

22:52.605 --> 22:54.905
       Cleanliness is next
          to godliness.

22:55.041 --> 22:56.841
         This is a mess.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.376
            Sweep it.

22:58.478 --> 23:00.478
   When you've finished that I
want you to do all those dishes.

23:00.613 --> 23:05.950
   <i> In all that time there was</i>
     <i> abuse, there was work,</i>

23:06.052 --> 23:07.985
  <i> and there was nothing else.</i>

23:08.087 --> 23:09.320
  You don't know how to sweep.

23:09.422 --> 23:11.555
         Let me show you
          how to sweep!

23:13.760 --> 23:14.558
          I had a farm.

23:14.660 --> 23:16.093
  One night I was driving home-

23:16.195 --> 23:18.796
   You had to push your mother
       down those stairs.

23:18.898 --> 23:19.964
          I hit a cat.

23:20.066 --> 23:21.332
         It's the lord.

23:21.467 --> 23:22.400
     The lord's testing me,
     the lord's testing me.

23:22.502 --> 23:23.534
       We're all just dirt
         and just filth-

23:23.636 --> 23:25.436
  Smeared it all over the road.

23:25.571 --> 23:27.338
        Trash over here.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.140
    He told me there's a law.

23:29.242 --> 23:30.908
       There's the water,
       there's the bucket.

23:31.043 --> 23:32.276
   You have to find the owner.

23:32.378 --> 23:34.311
  So I... Like, liquor bottles.

23:34.447 --> 23:36.547
       That didn't happen
        when you came...

23:36.682 --> 23:38.082
     ...showed me the tag...

23:42.221 --> 23:46.524
   <i> There were times I thought</i>
         <i> I'd go crazy.</i>

23:51.030 --> 23:53.831
      <i> But thinking of home</i>
         <i> kept me sane.</i>

23:56.035 --> 23:58.636
          Stop talking
       about your family!

23:58.738 --> 24:02.473
       I don't wanna hear
   about swings and car rides!

24:02.575 --> 24:05.309
          They are not
      your family anymore!

24:05.411 --> 24:07.845
  They broke covenant with God

24:07.947 --> 24:11.048
 and that's why they were called
     upon to sacrifice you.

24:13.686 --> 24:17.721
      And I will kill them
      if you forget again!

24:17.857 --> 24:22.326
    No, no, I'm sorry, please
    don't do that, I'm sorry.

24:22.428 --> 24:25.296
  You're fighting your calling.

24:25.364 --> 24:27.731
 And to think I thought you were
    ready to go to the stream

24:27.834 --> 24:29.733
     and help collect water.

24:29.836 --> 24:30.801
          I- I'm ready.

24:30.937 --> 24:33.504
          I- I promise.

24:33.573 --> 24:36.440
     Please let me help you
        carry the water.

24:36.542 --> 24:38.809
     <i> I'd beg to go anywhere</i>
         <i> with my rapist</i>

24:38.911 --> 24:42.213
<i>if it meant that I wouldn't die</i>
           <i> of thirst.</i>

24:42.315 --> 24:46.617
     Patience and endurance
       became my weapons,

24:46.752 --> 24:48.719
       and it wasn't easy.

24:48.821 --> 24:52.389
     <i> I had to submit to get</i>
      <i> any kind of freedom.</i>

24:55.895 --> 24:58.696
     Praise God, Hephzibah.

25:01.167 --> 25:05.169
    My new wife has accepted
          her calling.

25:05.271 --> 25:07.505
      She no longer resists
      the will of the lord.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.643
  <i> This is one thing I want you</i>
         <i> to understand.</i>

25:12.745 --> 25:16.080
 I never had Stockholm Syndrome.

25:16.182 --> 25:18.716
    Just because I physically
        stopped resisting

25:18.784 --> 25:21.151
   didn't mean that I hated it
            any less.

25:21.254 --> 25:23.020
      I wasn't sympathetic
          towards them.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.322
        I despised them.

25:27.827 --> 25:35.232
  Your carnal urges find Esther
         day and night,

25:35.334 --> 25:40.938
     night and day, because
   she is young and beautiful,

25:41.007 --> 25:43.607
  ignoring the mother of Zion!

25:43.776 --> 25:45.209
     You're not acting like
       the mother of Zion!

25:45.311 --> 25:47.278
    You said we would share!

25:47.380 --> 25:48.012
             We do!

25:48.114 --> 25:49.547
     You never lie with me!

25:49.649 --> 25:50.281
              I do!

25:50.383 --> 25:52.516
     Not since she got here!

26:08.935 --> 26:11.468
   Esther, my wife, come here.

26:15.541 --> 26:17.141
      The lord has spoken.

26:20.680 --> 26:22.513
           Hephzibah,

26:22.615 --> 26:27.952
  my sunshine, you will be mine
         during the day.

26:28.054 --> 26:30.754
    Esther is not as bright.

26:30.856 --> 26:33.457
   She will be mine at night.

26:33.593 --> 26:35.926
Thus is the divine proclamation.

26:38.531 --> 26:41.532
           Praise God.

26:41.667 --> 26:43.400
           Praise God.

27:05.958 --> 27:09.994
 <i> There aren't words to describe</i>
   <i> how great that sound was,</i>

27:10.129 --> 27:13.464
 <i> but I paid for it with a piece</i>
          <i> of my soul.</i>

27:28.080 --> 27:31.148
         You are ready.

27:31.283 --> 27:33.350
        You will be good.

27:33.452 --> 27:34.618
         I will be good.

27:38.124 --> 27:40.591
    <i> We were always thirsty.</i>

27:40.693 --> 27:41.992
   <i> Water was in short supply</i>

27:42.094 --> 27:44.962
  <i> because it was so difficult</i>
            <i> to get.</i>

28:30.109 --> 28:31.875
    Who said you could drink?

28:33.879 --> 28:37.314
 Fill the jugs for your family.

28:37.450 --> 28:41.118
    <i> I didn't have the energy</i>
         <i> to outrun him.</i>

28:41.253 --> 28:43.654
  <i> I would have taken two steps</i>
  <i> and he would have caught me</i>

28:43.756 --> 28:46.123
     <i> and then I would have</i>
         <i> paid severely.</i>

28:48.394 --> 28:51.395
     <i> That doesn't mean that</i>
    <i> I didn't try to escape.</i>

28:51.497 --> 28:53.664
         <i> I used to read</i>
     <i> Louis L'amour westerns</i>

28:53.799 --> 28:56.734
     <i> and I knew that people</i>
      <i> could follow tracks.</i>

29:08.013 --> 29:09.713
           Fill that.

29:09.782 --> 29:12.015
       Wash your face, and
       then you can drink.

30:07.673 --> 30:09.339
          Back in 1997,

30:09.508 --> 30:11.708
     when the lord declared
        our hitch hiking

30:11.777 --> 30:14.311
      and covenanting with
      his people at an end,

30:14.413 --> 30:18.949
      Immanuel was directed
   to begin wearing tunics...

30:19.051 --> 30:20.584
              Hey.

30:20.686 --> 30:23.821
     Sorry, I was listening.

30:23.923 --> 30:26.089
       As well you should.

30:26.158 --> 30:31.995
    These two talked non-stop
  but I forced myself to listen

30:32.064 --> 30:36.333
   because I knew I would hear
     something I could use.

30:36.435 --> 30:39.203
    When he goes to Salt Lake
    to minister and plunder,

30:39.338 --> 30:41.438
      what does that mean?

30:41.540 --> 30:44.508
      Immanuel ministers to
   the citizens on the street

30:44.610 --> 30:48.111
       who give him money
      to help sustain him.

30:48.247 --> 30:50.380
         And plundering?

30:53.419 --> 30:55.586
   When the children of Israel
         captured a city

30:55.721 --> 30:57.454
    they would plunder goods
       and bring them back

30:57.556 --> 30:59.890
    for the lord's purposes.

30:59.959 --> 31:02.125
  Immanuel goes into the stores
          of the wicked

31:02.261 --> 31:07.764
   and takes goods in the name
          of the lord.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.633
    So he shoplifts for God.

31:09.735 --> 31:12.169
    He plunders for the lord.

31:12.304 --> 31:14.705
       Yes, of- of course.

31:14.807 --> 31:17.374
   Um... I was just concerned
  as to what the non-believers

31:17.476 --> 31:18.842
          would think.

31:24.116 --> 31:25.816
    What if he gets arrested?

31:25.951 --> 31:26.984
         He has the key.

31:27.086 --> 31:29.253
        We'd die up here.

31:29.388 --> 31:31.221
      He doesn't have a key
             to me.

31:34.426 --> 31:35.525
      Well, what about if-

31:35.628 --> 31:42.099
     ♪ I need the every hour
      most gracious lord. ♪

32:09.228 --> 32:11.128
    <i> I am a lightening bolt!</i>

32:11.230 --> 32:13.397
      <i> Sent from the lord!</i>

32:13.465 --> 32:15.065
         I am the rain!

32:16.201 --> 32:17.301
        I am the thunder!

32:17.436 --> 32:21.238
       Wives, your husband
          has returned.

32:21.340 --> 32:24.641
     Guess what I saw while
        I was down there?

32:24.743 --> 32:31.949
  I saw my sweet Esther's face
   plastered all over the city

32:32.084 --> 32:35.352
         in every store,
       on every lamp post.

32:35.487 --> 32:38.121
    Posters of her absolutely
           everywhere,

32:38.190 --> 32:39.222
   and you know what I thought

32:39.358 --> 32:42.326
      the whole time I was
         walking around?

32:42.428 --> 32:47.264
I thought, I got the real McCoy.

32:49.668 --> 32:52.636
     And that made me proud.

32:52.771 --> 32:57.441
               Ah!

32:57.543 --> 32:59.676
        Can- can we eat?

33:09.655 --> 33:11.355
      You can eat whatever
            you want.

33:11.457 --> 33:13.657
     Anything you see there.

33:13.726 --> 33:14.958
             After.

33:16.795 --> 33:18.261
             After.

33:18.330 --> 33:21.565
     Hephzibah, the chalice?

33:21.700 --> 33:25.535
After we all have the sacrament.

33:29.675 --> 33:30.907
        Our God almighty.

33:32.211 --> 33:36.279
   Bless this wine through me,
       your true prophet.

33:36.382 --> 33:37.481
              Amen.

33:40.652 --> 33:43.820
  You will take the sacrament,
             Esther.

33:43.922 --> 33:44.921
               No.

33:45.024 --> 33:48.892
       You will drink when
      I tell you to drink.

33:48.994 --> 33:49.960
         I won't do it.

33:50.062 --> 33:52.229
     Jesus Christ descended
           from heaven

33:52.331 --> 33:54.464
   to live amongst the lepers!

33:54.566 --> 33:56.666
     You think you're better
          than Jesus?!

33:56.769 --> 33:59.736
    You think you don't need
         to be lowered?!

34:03.742 --> 34:05.308
        I promised myself
      I would never drink.

34:05.444 --> 34:06.977
      That's the one thing
     you can't hold me down

34:07.079 --> 34:09.545
         and make me do.

34:09.614 --> 34:12.649
   I can make you do anything.

34:12.751 --> 34:14.985
       Drink, work, think.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.853
        You do what I say
           when I say.

34:27.366 --> 34:29.699
            No sleep.

34:29.802 --> 34:34.271
            No water.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.940
            No food.

34:37.042 --> 34:39.775
       Until you drink it.

34:39.878 --> 34:41.311
           <i> I was 14.</i>

34:41.413 --> 34:43.813
 <i> I'd never even tasted alcohol.</i>

35:22.154 --> 35:23.854
    Now you can eat, Esther.

35:23.956 --> 35:25.622
        Now you can eat.

35:25.724 --> 35:27.858
          Now, eat up.

35:42.708 --> 35:46.877
   <i> I had never understood why</i>
<i>people would want to get drunk,</i>

35:46.979 --> 35:50.580
   <i> but after two cups of wine</i>
          <i> I was numb.</i>

35:50.716 --> 35:52.215
       Then I understood.

36:00.125 --> 36:01.324
             I know.

36:01.426 --> 36:05.162
     I saw water in the tent
        not two days ago.

36:05.264 --> 36:08.098
          We drank it.

36:42.267 --> 36:47.904
   <i> I know there was no water</i>
        <i> near that camp.</i>

36:56.515 --> 36:58.515
 <i> I believe that was a miracle.</i>

36:58.617 --> 37:02.819
    <i> It's fine if you don't,</i>
         <i> I understand.</i>

37:02.955 --> 37:08.725
 <i> God offers hope in the darkest</i>
 <i> places and that is a miracle.</i>

37:08.827 --> 37:12.128
  <i> Mine was that cup of water.</i>

37:26.278 --> 37:28.445
  You're not digging too close
to those support beams, are you?

37:28.580 --> 37:29.613
  'Cause if there's no shelter
           come winter

37:29.715 --> 37:32.983
     we're gonna have to go
        some place warm.

37:33.118 --> 37:35.352
Please tell me there's one thing
        you can do right.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.454
      I'm doing it exactly
        like you told me.

37:37.556 --> 37:38.888
            Your way.

37:42.594 --> 37:47.297
   So do you think that he'll
    let us see the fireworks?

38:00.912 --> 38:02.879
             <i> Woooo!</i>

38:04.583 --> 38:06.683
      Happy Fourth of July!

38:06.785 --> 38:07.751
              Whoo!

38:07.853 --> 38:11.154
             Ho, ho!

38:11.290 --> 38:12.789
  We're gonna eat that, right?

38:12.891 --> 38:14.524
   We'll have a fire tonight.

38:14.660 --> 38:15.959
       Won't someone see?

38:16.094 --> 38:17.360
     It's been over a month.

38:17.462 --> 38:19.696
      They're not searching
       the woods anymore.

38:19.831 --> 38:22.065
        The lord is good.

38:22.134 --> 38:25.035
  The lord working through me.

38:25.137 --> 38:28.204
    I provide for my family,
            don't I?

38:28.307 --> 38:30.573
    You are a great provider.

38:30.676 --> 38:33.109
        Don't I, Esther?

38:33.211 --> 38:34.611
          Yes. You do.

38:34.713 --> 38:36.346
    You're the best provider.

38:39.651 --> 38:41.351
     Make that dish I love.

38:41.453 --> 38:43.386
 We'll see the fireworks first.

38:45.824 --> 38:47.357
           Thank you!

38:47.459 --> 38:49.092
           Thank you.

39:05.811 --> 39:07.277
Why are you just standing there?

39:39.177 --> 39:40.677
      <i> Seeing the fireworks</i>
          <i> reminded me</i>

39:40.779 --> 39:42.545
        <i> of my family and</i>
       <i> of the happy life</i>

39:42.647 --> 39:44.981
   <i> that had been stolen away</i>
            <i> from me.</i>

39:53.058 --> 39:56.059
 <i> After the fireworks were over</i>
  <i> and I was taken back to camp</i>

39:56.128 --> 39:59.429
        <i> I was made to do</i>
        <i> terrible things.</i>

39:59.564 --> 40:03.233
        <i> Nothing was ever</i>
       <i> just given to me.</i>

40:03.335 --> 40:04.401
          Who's Olivia?

40:07.973 --> 40:09.506
        You were talking
        about an Olivia.

40:09.574 --> 40:12.308
             I was?

40:12.377 --> 40:15.245
 I didn't- I didn't know I was.

40:15.347 --> 40:17.447
        She's my cousin.

40:17.582 --> 40:18.782
        I will allow it.

40:22.654 --> 40:24.888
  We had so much fun together.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.023
   We're almost the same age.

40:27.125 --> 40:28.825
  She's, like, my best friend.

40:31.596 --> 40:33.530
           I mean was.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.265
      Before you saved me.

40:38.170 --> 40:39.169
              Mmm.

40:56.955 --> 41:01.157
         I have another
      divine proclamation.

41:01.226 --> 41:04.761
    The lord has commanded me
  to go forth and pluck Olivia

41:04.863 --> 41:07.130
 from the world and to take her
        as my third wife.

41:07.232 --> 41:09.199
               No.

41:09.301 --> 41:14.003
        I must obey him.

41:14.139 --> 41:16.239
    It will be done tonight.

41:16.374 --> 41:19.476
      I know the house well
   and I know my methods work.

41:19.578 --> 41:21.511
    Pack the bags, Hephzibah.

41:29.120 --> 41:31.855
    <i> I felt guilty that I had</i>
       <i> mentioned Olivia.</i>

41:31.957 --> 41:34.724
  <i> That I had painted a target</i>
          <i> on her back.</i>

41:37.529 --> 41:41.931
    <i> But my next thought was,</i>
        <i> if he gets her,</i>

41:42.033 --> 41:44.501
   <i> I won't be alone anymore.</i>

41:49.574 --> 41:52.809
        You will be good
     while I'm away, Esther.

41:52.911 --> 41:54.911
        You will be good.

42:07.959 --> 42:10.593
    Please keep Olivia safe,
              God.

42:10.695 --> 42:13.730
       Please protect her.

42:13.832 --> 42:18.902
    Please don't let anything
         happen to her.

42:19.004 --> 42:23.673
Was I really gonna sit there and
 watch my best friend be raped,

42:23.742 --> 42:25.742
       be hurt, be abused
       the same way I had?

42:25.911 --> 42:29.012
Go through all the same terrible
       things that I had?

42:46.398 --> 42:48.765
         What happened?

42:48.867 --> 42:52.569
              Argh.

42:52.704 --> 42:56.306
  When I pushed back the blinds
   to crawl through the window

42:56.408 --> 42:58.675
 something crashed to the floor.

42:58.777 --> 43:03.179
         Lights come on,
    someone starts shouting.

43:03.281 --> 43:08.318
  I realized God had not chosen
    Olivia to be my new wife.

43:08.420 --> 43:10.119
      He blocked your way.

43:10.221 --> 43:12.355
 You're free of that burden now.

43:12.457 --> 43:16.459
      I'm gonna take a nap.

43:16.528 --> 43:17.694
 <i> The lord didn't choose Olivia.</i>

43:17.796 --> 43:20.430
      <i> She wasn't the one.</i>

43:20.532 --> 43:21.898
           <i> So why me?</i>

43:21.967 --> 43:24.734
   <i> Why didn't something block</i>
         <i> his way to me?</i>

43:52.897 --> 43:54.163
              More.

44:05.944 --> 44:07.644
            I did it!

44:07.712 --> 44:09.512
      I got it. I saved it.

44:09.614 --> 44:10.880
         Like the world.

44:14.185 --> 44:15.418
      Guys, I need to pee.

44:15.520 --> 44:16.519
            Then go.

44:19.357 --> 44:24.193
          ♪ I need thee
          every hour, ♪

44:24.295 --> 44:30.233
      ♪ stay down nearby, ♪

44:30.368 --> 44:31.668
          ♪ So stay- ♪

44:31.770 --> 44:36.739
      ♪ So stay nearby... ♪

44:50.789 --> 44:53.056
No!

45:03.234 --> 45:05.368
        I break his rules
     and someone gets hurt.

45:05.537 --> 45:08.237
    I realized that if I was
         going to escape

45:08.339 --> 45:10.373
   I had to play by his rules.

45:10.475 --> 45:13.209
     I used to teach music.

45:15.847 --> 45:21.017
  Now I just try to teach you.

45:24.989 --> 45:32.195
 You're truly strong to give up
     teaching others and...

45:32.263 --> 45:37.200
   and since now that Immanuel
         goes to Babylon

45:37.268 --> 45:40.136
    and you have to stay here
           with me...

45:40.238 --> 45:42.672
    I guess what would happen
    to the world without you.

45:42.807 --> 45:49.512
    Well, it hasn't been easy
locked up with you all day long.

45:49.614 --> 45:52.749
  You sacrifice so much for me.

45:52.851 --> 45:54.250
   I- I'm not worthy of that.

45:57.422 --> 45:59.989
           You're not.

46:00.125 --> 46:03.392
    I didn't do this for you.

46:07.665 --> 46:11.000
  The word of God brings bounty
        to the righteous.

46:13.538 --> 46:16.272
   A glorious day in Babylon.

46:16.407 --> 46:18.808
           Oh, was it?

46:18.910 --> 46:19.475
             Was it?

46:19.577 --> 46:23.980
     Was it a glorious day?

46:24.082 --> 46:26.349
    Well, it wasn't up here.

46:26.451 --> 46:30.353
      Maybe I will go down
             and see

46:30.488 --> 46:33.623
  how glorious it is out there!

46:33.725 --> 46:37.126
  You don't think that I will.

46:39.831 --> 46:41.564
            Watch me!

46:44.369 --> 46:46.636
    She's- she's coming back,
             right?

46:46.738 --> 46:48.604
         At some point.

46:48.706 --> 46:51.174
       Hopefully not soon.

46:51.276 --> 46:53.910
   How- how often does she go
    into the city on her own?

46:54.045 --> 46:56.012
  She's not going to the city.

46:56.080 --> 46:57.246
       She wouldn't leave
          this mountain

46:57.348 --> 47:02.218
   without divine dispensation
            from me.

47:02.320 --> 47:04.320
         I want you now.

47:04.455 --> 47:08.624
  Right here, out in the open,
   with only God watching us.

47:08.760 --> 47:10.126
     God doesn't want us to.

47:10.228 --> 47:12.261
       Of course he does.

47:12.363 --> 47:14.263
   It's why he gave you to me.

47:14.365 --> 47:16.966
      What about the divine
          proclamation

47:17.101 --> 47:19.402
   that you're only to have me
            at night?

47:19.504 --> 47:21.637
   That came from God, right?

47:21.739 --> 47:23.206
              Yeah.

47:23.274 --> 47:26.309
  Well, then we'll be breaking
        his command and-

47:26.444 --> 47:28.177
and I'll have to tell Hephzibah.

47:28.346 --> 47:30.713
       She'll need to know
        as mother of Zion

47:30.815 --> 47:33.649
     when she gets back here
           any minute-

47:40.158 --> 47:41.557
              Fine.

48:05.984 --> 48:08.951
  Hephzibah has returned to us,
             Esther.

48:09.053 --> 48:10.519
              Yes.

48:13.124 --> 48:15.391
           Hephzibah.

48:15.493 --> 48:18.594
            My queen.

48:18.696 --> 48:21.497
     You truly have a place
            in heaven

48:21.633 --> 48:24.166
  as long as you stay faithful
         to the calling.

48:24.235 --> 48:27.770
         I am faithful.

48:27.906 --> 48:31.874
You are the one that's forgotten
           your place.

48:32.010 --> 48:35.344
       I'm done staying up
      here, starving, while
       you go down, party,

48:35.446 --> 48:37.179
      do whatever you want.

48:37.315 --> 48:38.214
           Impossible.

48:38.283 --> 48:40.583
         You know Esther
      can't be left alone.

48:40.685 --> 48:42.785
      You know what I know?

48:42.887 --> 48:47.323
        If you're going,
           I'm going.

49:22.927 --> 49:24.393
        I will kill you!

49:38.176 --> 49:39.275
      If I disobeyed them,

49:39.377 --> 49:41.978
        if I called out,
         if I screamed,

49:42.080 --> 49:44.347
   they would have killed me.

49:52.290 --> 49:53.289

50:08.873 --> 50:09.472
            He will.

50:09.574 --> 50:11.207
      He'll kill them all.

50:27.892 --> 50:29.091
          Liquor first.

01:01:19.243 --> 01:01:21.777
<i>That I was thankful for the tent</i>
   <i> that I was being raped in</i>

01:01:21.912 --> 01:01:25.614
<i>because it kept the sun off me?</i>

01:01:25.749 --> 01:01:28.583
    <i> Or because people would</i>
 <i> throw out their leftover food</i>

01:01:28.719 --> 01:01:31.987
     <i> because it meant that</i>
      <i> I had another meal?</i>

01:01:34.425 --> 01:01:37.159
        Merry Christmas.

01:01:37.261 --> 01:01:38.794
        Merry Christmas.

01:01:38.896 --> 01:01:43.131
  <i> What God does is offer hope</i>
     <i> in those dark places.</i>

01:01:43.233 --> 01:01:45.300
         <i> God is a ride</i>
       <i> when you're tired.</i>

01:01:45.402 --> 01:01:47.402
      <i> A man with a radio.</i>

01:01:47.504 --> 01:01:51.406
        <i> A cup of water.</i>

01:01:51.542 --> 01:01:53.775
          <i> God is hope,</i>

01:01:53.911 --> 01:01:56.745
       <i> and it's hope that</i>
      <i> keeps you fighting.</i>

01:02:08.826 --> 01:02:09.558
             <i> Hello?</i>

01:02:11.395 --> 01:02:12.294
              <i> Hey.</i>

01:02:16.533 --> 01:02:17.799
          Anyone there?

01:02:22.473 --> 01:02:23.839
      <i> If I'd have yelled,</i>

01:02:23.974 --> 01:02:26.108
      <i> Mitchell would have</i>
           <i> killed him</i>

01:02:26.243 --> 01:02:29.745
  <i> and then Mitchell would have</i>
           <i> killed me.</i>

01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:33.348
<i>I wasn't going to be the reason</i>
      <i> that this man died.</i>

01:02:37.688 --> 01:02:39.287
   <i> That doesn't make me weak.</i>

01:02:39.389 --> 01:02:40.856
     <i> That makes me strong.</i>

01:02:44.328 --> 01:02:46.962
  California was supposed to be
   a test of our faithfulness.

01:02:47.064 --> 01:02:49.164
    But now a heathen entered
            our camp!

01:02:49.233 --> 01:02:51.333
      Pack up, both of you.

01:02:51.435 --> 01:02:52.968
    Because of your failings
    we're gonna have to move.

01:03:20.831 --> 01:03:24.499
 You drag us all the way up here
    and have the gall to say

01:03:24.635 --> 01:03:27.435
       that we're the ones
      who's faith is weak?!

01:03:27.538 --> 01:03:31.706
       You sin with lust!

01:03:31.809 --> 01:03:35.343
  Days go by and you don't get
            any work!

01:03:35.445 --> 01:03:36.711
       Don't get any food!

01:03:39.817 --> 01:03:42.317
       Greed, envy, wrath.

01:03:42.452 --> 01:03:43.919
   This is the mother of Zion.

01:03:44.054 --> 01:03:46.521
     Heaven turns and weeps
     from the sight of you.

01:03:51.461 --> 01:03:54.062
    I'm going to kill myself.

01:03:54.198 --> 01:03:56.932
     Then what will you do?

01:03:57.034 --> 01:04:00.368
     I am gonna kill myself
           right now.

01:04:00.504 --> 01:04:01.970
           Hephzibah.

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:04.339
      Hephzibah, not again.

01:04:04.474 --> 01:04:05.774
           Not again.

01:04:05.876 --> 01:04:07.375
            It's ok.

01:04:07.477 --> 01:04:08.944
        Come on, it's ok.

01:04:11.381 --> 01:04:12.047
               No!

01:04:12.149 --> 01:04:12.581
            Drop it!

01:04:12.683 --> 01:04:13.515
               No!

01:04:22.826 --> 01:04:25.193
      You almost killed me,
       you demonic shrew!

01:04:38.675 --> 01:04:44.112
      It is my turn to talk
   and you're going to listen.

01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:47.616
     God told me my election
    to heaven is now assured.

01:04:47.751 --> 01:04:50.685
   It doesn't matter what I do
          from now on.

01:04:50.754 --> 01:04:53.054
        I no longer have
         to follow you.

01:04:53.123 --> 01:04:55.023
       But you, Immanuel,

01:04:55.125 --> 01:04:58.393
   you are no longer following
       in God's footsteps.

01:04:58.495 --> 01:05:00.996
        You have strayed
         from the path.

01:05:01.098 --> 01:05:05.267
    You can't leave, you have
        to face this now.

01:05:05.402 --> 01:05:07.636
       I'm going to town,

01:05:07.738 --> 01:05:09.638
        and I don't know
       when I'll be back.

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:16.711
          What- where-
       where is he going?

01:05:16.813 --> 01:05:18.213
    Is he- is he coming back?

01:05:18.348 --> 01:05:20.615
  Is he gonna bring back food?

01:05:20.717 --> 01:05:22.550
    <i> When Mitchell left camp</i>
            <i> that day</i>

01:05:22.619 --> 01:05:25.120
    <i> we only had enough food</i>
    <i> and water for two days.</i>

01:06:04.661 --> 01:06:06.161
   What do we do if he doesn't
           come back?

01:06:15.839 --> 01:06:17.772
      Can we go get water?

01:06:17.908 --> 01:06:19.774
          I won't run.

01:06:19.876 --> 01:06:21.376
          I can't run.

01:06:41.565 --> 01:06:46.501
 <i> I had wanted to see my family</i>
         <i> one last time,</i>

01:06:46.636 --> 01:06:47.936
     <i> but as I waited to die</i>

01:06:51.274 --> 01:06:54.576
   <i> I felt grateful that I had</i>
        <i> had them at all.</i>

01:08:02.779 --> 01:08:03.445
           <i> It rained.</i>

01:08:03.547 --> 01:08:05.747
         <i> In California.</i>

01:08:05.849 --> 01:08:08.950
      <i> Now, no one can say</i>
      <i> it wasn't a miracle</i>

01:08:09.052 --> 01:08:11.753
   <i> and another sign of hope.</i>

01:08:27.970 --> 01:08:32.474
          I talked them
    into giving me leftovers.

01:08:32.576 --> 01:08:35.042
      Immanuel, where have
            you been?

01:08:35.145 --> 01:08:37.812
     Well, the cops got me.

01:08:43.086 --> 01:08:45.353
   Anyway, I've been locked up
        for a whole week

01:08:45.522 --> 01:08:47.255
  so I wandered around the city
       for a little while,

01:08:47.390 --> 01:08:50.291
 got supplies, and then I headed
           back here.

01:08:50.393 --> 01:08:54.529
  You left us up here for seven
  days without a scrap of food.

01:08:54.663 --> 01:08:55.662
          Not a scrap.

01:08:55.765 --> 01:08:58.166
  The lord called me to prison!

01:08:58.234 --> 01:09:01.002
     Seven days of preaching
         to the inmates.

01:09:01.138 --> 01:09:04.538
  In prison you had three meals
             a day.

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:06.674
    Esther and I had nothing!

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:08.810
    You left us with nothing!

01:09:10.412 --> 01:09:12.279
    You left us here to die!

01:09:14.251 --> 01:09:16.518
  All I did was serve the lord.

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:52.620
     I have an announcement.

01:09:59.696 --> 01:10:00.762
      The lord has declared

01:10:00.864 --> 01:10:03.898
   it's time for us to move on
        from California.

01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.467
           Praise God.

01:10:06.570 --> 01:10:09.337
 To a camp near food and water.

01:10:09.439 --> 01:10:11.573
Some place where people know us?

01:10:11.675 --> 01:10:14.809
 Back to the east coast, maybe.

01:10:14.911 --> 01:10:19.180
 My students in Boston loved me.

01:10:19.282 --> 01:10:23.117
         A move that big
       will be permanent.

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:34.696
  I uh... I've been overwhelmed
        with the feeling

01:10:34.798 --> 01:10:38.433
  that God wants us to go back
          to Salt Lake.

01:10:38.501 --> 01:10:41.236
    He told you that you'd be
     blessed with more wives

01:10:41.338 --> 01:10:44.872
and since our path here has been
         blocked I just-

01:10:44.975 --> 01:10:46.007
     I just have the feeling

01:10:46.109 --> 01:10:49.077
      that it'll be harder
       for you back east.

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:51.646
        And I know that,
        in the mountains,

01:10:51.781 --> 01:10:55.483
    that there are all these
     grow camps and I mean-

01:10:55.619 --> 01:10:59.454
     I- I don't know, but...

01:10:59.623 --> 01:11:02.790
    do you think you can ask
    the lord if that's right?

01:11:02.892 --> 01:11:04.826
    I know he'll answer you.

01:11:04.894 --> 01:11:07.495
   <i> I'd spent months listening</i>
            <i> to them.</i>

01:11:07.631 --> 01:11:09.931
      <i> I'd become an expert</i>
      <i> in playing the role</i>

01:11:10.033 --> 01:11:11.666
    <i> that was expected of me.</i>

01:11:11.768 --> 01:11:14.769
 <i> I knew their made up religion</i>
         <i> inside and out</i>

01:11:14.904 --> 01:11:19.274
      <i> and how to twist it</i>
     <i> in just the right way.</i>

01:11:19.409 --> 01:11:21.042
       I will pray on it.

01:11:25.015 --> 01:11:28.816
  But it'll take longer to get
  the money here than in Utah.

01:11:32.589 --> 01:11:36.024
   Can we- can we hitch hike?

01:11:36.126 --> 01:11:39.661
   It's just... Hephzibah has
     told me how you and she

01:11:39.763 --> 01:11:41.229
        would hitch hike.

01:11:41.331 --> 01:11:44.465
   I've never done it before.

01:11:44.601 --> 01:11:49.837
    Ed and Lois sheltered me
   and I feel that it would be

01:11:49.973 --> 01:11:52.874
   instrumental in my descent
        below all things.

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:56.744
 I- I need to be brought lower,
          I know that.

01:11:56.913 --> 01:11:59.547
   And- and then you wouldn't
   have to spend days and days

01:11:59.683 --> 01:12:04.218
 on your own, collecting money,
       leaving us up here.

01:12:04.321 --> 01:12:06.688
              Yes.

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:09.791
        Shearjashub needs
         the experience,

01:12:09.893 --> 01:12:11.292
     and you will no longer
        have to minister

01:12:11.394 --> 01:12:15.163
  the ungrateful of California.

01:12:22.639 --> 01:12:27.141
 I will have to find a different
 head covering for Shearjashub.

01:12:27.277 --> 01:12:29.844
   And no one will pick us up
         on these roads.

01:12:30.013 --> 01:12:32.213
    What- whatever you think
            is best.

01:12:32.315 --> 01:12:33.948
         You alone know
        the rule of God.

01:12:34.117 --> 01:12:35.283
              Mmm.

01:12:39.122 --> 01:12:42.290
  The lord is beginning to work
     with you, Shearjashub,

01:12:42.392 --> 01:12:46.160
  and that makes me very happy.

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:50.298
   <i> I got him to take me back</i>
            <i> to Utah.</i>

01:12:50.367 --> 01:12:53.501

      just a little broken.

01:14:55.792 --> 01:14:57.892
       What did I tell you
    about talking to people?

01:14:57.994 --> 01:15:02.196
    You never talk to people!

01:15:02.332 --> 01:15:04.098
      We're not coming down
        off that mountain

01:15:04.200 --> 01:15:06.934
     'til the world has gone
            to seed.

01:15:07.036 --> 01:15:09.403
       We're too important
      to the end of times!

  <i> That night, as he did every</i>

01:15:14.377 --> 01:15:17.078
      Brian David Mitchell
            raped me,

01:15:17.213 --> 01:15:19.247
    but it was the last time.

01:16:38.661 --> 01:16:39.660
            Let's go.

01:16:42.565 --> 01:16:44.231
      You're not up there.

01:16:44.334 --> 01:16:47.101
    No one remembers or cares
       about you anymore.

01:16:47.203 --> 01:16:49.170
      You're mine forever,
          now let's go.

01:17:01.818 --> 01:17:02.516
              Sir?

01:17:02.652 --> 01:17:04.752
    I need to speak with you.

01:17:04.821 --> 01:17:06.187
        You need to stop.

01:17:09.592 --> 01:17:10.291
      I'm from out of town.

01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:11.959
         I'm a minister.

01:17:12.061 --> 01:17:12.927
        What's your name?

01:17:19.268 --> 01:17:22.003
        What's your name?

01:17:22.105 --> 01:17:22.937
       Her name is Esther.

01:17:23.072 --> 01:17:24.005
    I'm not speaking to you,
              sir.

01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.774
         I'm speaking to
         the young lady.

01:17:26.876 --> 01:17:28.876
        Hold on, hold on,
          she's scared.

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:32.246
           Come here.

01:17:32.348 --> 01:17:34.048
          Come with me.

01:17:35.752 --> 01:17:36.784
            It's ok.

01:17:36.919 --> 01:17:38.619
    Nobody's gonna hurt you.

01:17:42.792 --> 01:17:44.959
  Is your name Elizabeth Smart?

01:17:59.475 --> 01:18:00.941
            It's ok.

01:18:03.746 --> 01:18:05.813
      I am Elizabeth Smart.

01:18:05.915 --> 01:18:07.615
      I am Elizabeth Smart.

01:18:16.092 --> 01:18:17.024
           Wait, what-

01:18:20.730 --> 01:18:22.163
  It's ok, it's just protocol.

01:18:22.298 --> 01:18:24.231
    He's just gonna take you
      down to the station.

01:18:25.735 --> 01:18:27.168
          Take 'em in.

01:18:58.534 --> 01:19:00.301
       Are they locked up?

01:19:00.403 --> 01:19:02.203
          Take a seat.

01:19:03.439 --> 01:19:04.772
         Am I free now?

01:19:14.217 --> 01:19:15.382
            Oh, God.

01:19:15.485 --> 01:19:16.450
           Elizabeth?

01:19:16.586 --> 01:19:17.718
              Dad?

01:19:21.224 --> 01:19:22.456
          You're alive!
           Oh my God!

01:19:48.551 --> 01:19:49.483
             Hello?

01:19:51.154 --> 01:19:53.087
Could you take your clothes off?

01:19:54.157 --> 01:19:55.656
     <i> Take off your pajamas!</i>

01:19:55.792 --> 01:19:56.924
      <i> Take off your robe.</i>

01:20:02.732 --> 01:20:03.964
           Elizabeth?

01:20:04.100 --> 01:20:05.266
              Mom!

01:20:05.401 --> 01:20:06.767
    <i> Woah, watch the clothes.</i>

01:20:06.869 --> 01:20:07.501
            Oh honey.

01:20:07.637 --> 01:20:08.302
       <i> They're evidence.</i>

01:20:11.641 --> 01:20:14.308
              Hey.

01:21:57.213 --> 01:21:58.145
              Hey.

01:22:04.453 --> 01:22:06.787
 Your father and I had the idea
    that everyone would sleep

01:22:06.856 --> 01:22:08.689
      in our room tonight.

01:22:11.027 --> 01:22:14.295
   Kinda like a slumber party.

01:22:14.430 --> 01:22:17.831
      Mom, this is my room.

01:22:17.967 --> 01:22:19.867
       And that's my bed.

01:22:19.969 --> 01:22:22.937
   So I'm gonna sleep in here.

01:22:23.072 --> 01:22:26.140
    And I'm gonna sleep well.

01:22:26.208 --> 01:22:27.274
               Ok.

01:22:34.283 --> 01:22:36.116
       I'll still be here
         in the morning.

01:22:36.252 --> 01:22:37.651
           I promise.

01:22:42.091 --> 01:22:43.624
            Alright.

01:22:43.759 --> 01:22:45.025
           Goodnight.

01:23:00.009 --> 01:23:02.543
 <i> Why did I tell you this story?</i>

01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:07.581
   <i> Those posters on the wall.</i>

01:23:07.683 --> 01:23:09.950
     <i> The children like me.</i>

01:23:10.052 --> 01:23:12.219
 <i> The others who have it worse.</i>

01:23:12.321 --> 01:23:14.755
 <i> The ones who don't come home.</i>

01:23:14.924 --> 01:23:19.493
I wanted to tell you, as someone
   who has been through hell,

01:23:19.628 --> 01:23:22.296
    that there still is hope.

01:23:22.431 --> 01:23:26.900
 <i> Find a miracle, hold on to it,</i>
        <i> and keep going.</i>

01:23:27.003 --> 01:23:28.535
        <i> I'm not cracked.</i>

01:23:28.671 --> 01:23:30.404
       <i> I'm not shattered.</i>

01:23:30.506 --> 01:23:33.440
      I am Elizabeth Smart.
