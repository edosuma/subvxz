[groans]

01:18.959 --> 01:21.667
A little polish here,
tighten a screw there,

01:21.750 --> 01:24.166
and sell them at a big profit.

01:24.250 --> 01:27.792

find room for this stuff?

01:39.291 --> 01:41.125

Sounds like a stowaway.

Oh, careful, Kit, that thing's probably
got enough fleas to start a circus.

04:16.291 --> 04:19.125
Is that your stomach or a subdivision?

Gee, Baloo, you think I can keep him?

04:22.500 --> 04:24.083
What's your name, little birdie?

I can tell Becky the truth.

But it's the truth, Becky.

I'm spending in the doghouse,

He's not always like this,
just when money's involved.

06:13.959 --> 06:16.917
Money? [squawks] I know where
there's more money than you ever seen.

06:17.000 --> 06:20.125
Gold, silver, wealth beyond imagination.

06:20.208 --> 06:21.291
Are you joking?

06:21.375 --> 06:25.041
It was buried by my former owner,
Captain Juan Toomany.

06:25.125 --> 06:28.917
He didn't trust maps,
so, he had me memorize the location.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.417
Wow!
Baloo, wait till you hear this!

06:31.875 --> 06:35.208

to pick up a few fast bucks.

06:35.291 --> 06:38.875
Baloo, listen, Ignatz knows
where there's a whole treasure.

06:38.959 --> 06:43.792
Kit, I'm in enough trouble.
I don't need help from some featherbrain.

06:43.875 --> 06:47.458
-You're beyond help.
-Ease off, Ignatz.

06:47.542 --> 06:50.375
Baloo, please,
just listen to him for a minute.

06:51.417 --> 06:54.417
Well, all right.
But just for you.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.959
Well, go ahead. Tell him.

06:56.041 --> 07:00.166
-Sorry. I don't speak half-wit.
-That tears it.

Take it easy, Papa Bear.
He's just a little bird.

07:04.333 --> 07:06.959

Yeah, you're right, Kit.

07:07.041 --> 07:11.709
I guess I'll have to figure
some other way to get some moola,

07:11.792 --> 07:14.542
like maybe selling Kentucky fried parrot.

07:19.500 --> 07:23.083

on the kindness of strangers.

Pretty nice for smelly
old clothes, huh, captain?

Now, let me get this straight.
This is all there was?

07:36.458 --> 07:39.500
Well, there was this crazy old parrot.

07:39.583 --> 07:41.959
Yeah, but... Mad Dog first.

07:42.041 --> 07:44.709
He didn't want any part of him.

07:47.333 --> 07:52.875
-You left the parrot?
-Yeah. It was my idea.

07:54.458 --> 07:55.542
Idiot!

07:55.625 --> 08:00.750
That ratty, old parrot happens to be
a living, breathing treasure map.

08:00.834 --> 08:01.875
Idiot!

08:01.959 --> 08:04.917
I'll do the smacking around here.

08:05.000 --> 08:08.041
Now, I want that also paltry parrot!

08:08.125 --> 08:12.542
Only he can tell me where
Captain Juan Toomany hid his millions.

08:13.333 --> 08:19.291
-Uh, how'd you know that, boss?
-The feared pirate Don Karnage

08:19.375 --> 08:22.834
knows all that a feared pirate
needs to know. You know?

08:22.917 --> 08:25.583
Besides, I stole his little
heart-shaped diary.

08:25.667 --> 08:27.375
Now, get me that bird!

08:30.166 --> 08:33.457
Oh, maybe I can find something
in the want ads

08:33.542 --> 08:38.582
where I can earn the 500 smackers
Rebecca says I owe her.

08:38.667 --> 08:40.582
Don't worry, it wasn't your fault.

08:40.667 --> 08:41.875
Hmm...

08:41.958 --> 08:46.125
"Own your own Cyrus P. McDonald
podiatry franchise

08:46.208 --> 08:49.625
wherever you see the sign

08:51.875 --> 08:54.333
We can't risk another oopsy.

08:54.458 --> 08:56.959
This time we'll use brains.

08:57.291 --> 08:58.667
Come on!

08:58.750 --> 09:00.834
[Dumptruck]
Well, what are we going to do?

09:01.208 --> 09:02.875
Hey! What's the...

09:03.000 --> 09:04.500
[Mad Dog] There!

09:06.208 --> 09:07.917
What am I supposed to be?

09:08.000 --> 09:11.417
You're a bird watcher, mutton head.

09:11.500 --> 09:17.375
Oh... yeah. I love the little birdies,
especially with French fries.

09:17.458 --> 09:20.750
Here. Try to sound like you know
what you're talking about,

09:20.834 --> 09:22.959
and don't come back without the bird!

09:23.041 --> 09:27.625
Aw, Baloo, if you'd just try
and make friends with Ignatz,

09:27.709 --> 09:29.250
then your money problems would be over.

09:29.333 --> 09:34.458
It's not that I don't like the bird,
little britches, it's that I hate him.

09:34.542 --> 09:36.542
He's got an annoying personality

09:36.625 --> 09:40.291
and looks like the losing side
of a pillow fight.

09:40.375 --> 09:43.125
I don't see you winning
any beauty pageants.

09:43.208 --> 09:45.834
[Dumptruck]
Oh, my goodness gracious!

09:47.500 --> 09:52.917
Would you just look at this
wonderful specimen of... birdiness.

09:53.000 --> 09:55.875
Uh, would you perhaps
be willing to sell it?

09:55.959 --> 10:00.083
Sell? Well, we might be willing
to part with it

10:00.166 --> 10:02.166
if the price is right.

10:02.250 --> 10:04.333
Baloo, what about the treasure?

10:04.417 --> 10:08.333
Kit, that flying parrot
doesn't know where any treasure is.

10:08.417 --> 10:11.250
He's just looking for free room and board.

10:12.959 --> 10:18.375
Now, let's step into my office
and talk turkey about parrots.

10:18.458 --> 10:20.875
[squawks]
Kit, please, don't let him sell me.

10:20.959 --> 10:23.458
If we could only get Baloo to listen.

10:23.542 --> 10:26.500
Listen, kid,
we could get the treasure ourselves.

10:26.625 --> 10:29.750
That'll solve Baloo's problems,
and we'll all be pals.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.792
You'll show me where it is?

10:32.875 --> 10:36.583
Sure. You and me are shipmates.
Share and share alike.

10:36.667 --> 10:40.750
We'll make old fatso happy
whether he wants us to or not.

10:43.458 --> 10:49.500
Oh, Kit! Come on out
and let Ignatz meet his new owner.

10:49.583 --> 10:53.333
[chuckles] I wonder where Kit
and the little, uh...

10:53.458 --> 10:56.750
rare Norwegian Blue have gone off to.

Kit...

11:00.291 --> 11:01.667

for the tyke to be out alone.

"Gone to Tucker Forest for treasure.
Don't wait up. Yours truly, Kit."

11:13.375 --> 11:17.166
Oh, little britches.
Say it isn't so.

11:36.709 --> 11:37.709
Now what?

11:37.792 --> 11:40.792
The treasure's buried
in Carlsbear Caverns.

11:40.875 --> 11:41.834
Where's that?

11:43.667 --> 11:45.125
It's a big hole in the ground.

11:45.208 --> 11:47.917
You can't miss it.
Ought to be around here somewhere.

11:48.000 --> 11:50.500
-Let me get my bearings.
-Oh, no!

There they are.
After them!

Not so fast, small one.

Fools. Since the bird
has gotten away,

12:29.875 --> 12:32.709
you will tell us where the treasure is.

Baloo told me to never talk to strangers.

12:35.291 --> 12:38.083
And I never met anybody stranger than you.

12:38.166 --> 12:41.208
Cute kid.
Where's the treasure?

12:41.291 --> 12:42.834
-I don't know.
-You do.

12:42.917 --> 12:43.792
-Don't!
-Do!

12:43.875 --> 12:45.375
-Don't!
-You don't?

12:45.917 --> 12:50.792
-Ah! But your feathered friend knows.
-You'll never catch him.

12:50.875 --> 12:54.166
Oh, you think not indeed,
my little noisy one.

12:54.250 --> 12:58.083
Well, they say the early bird
catches the worm.

12:58.166 --> 13:02.083
And you are my worm
for catching the early bird.

13:02.166 --> 13:06.667
Oh, boy! If we're going fishing,
I love worms,

13:06.750 --> 13:09.000
especially with French fries.

13:13.208 --> 13:16.625
Kit! Kit!

13:16.709 --> 13:19.041
Where are you, little britches?

13:22.792 --> 13:26.250
[squawks]
Kit! Kidnapped! Pirates!

13:26.333 --> 13:30.750
If anything happens to that boy,
I'll break every bone in your head!

13:30.834 --> 13:32.083
Now, where is he?

13:32.166 --> 13:36.375
Look, stop wasting time.
I know where Kit is, and I have a plan.

13:36.458 --> 13:41.291
You have a plan?
Listening to you got Kit into this mess.

13:41.375 --> 13:44.291
You not listening to me
got Kit into this mess.

13:44.375 --> 13:46.375
I ought to, I ought to...

13:46.917 --> 13:51.291
[sighs] I ought to kick myself
in the pants but my leg's not long enough.

13:51.375 --> 13:52.375
I volunteer.

13:52.458 --> 13:57.667
All right, but if those yahoos
do anything to Kit, I'll--

13:57.875 --> 13:59.583
-[Kit laughing]
-Kit!

13:59.667 --> 14:01.625
[laughing]

14:04.333 --> 14:06.208
No, please, no!

14:06.291 --> 14:08.041
Oh, hey, it's Kit!

14:08.125 --> 14:11.959
Stop! Oh, stop!
I'd rather do algebra.

14:12.041 --> 14:15.250
[laughing]

14:15.709 --> 14:18.625
I can't stand it.
We have to do something!

14:18.709 --> 14:21.000
You're in charge, so charge!

14:21.083 --> 14:24.667
Not so fast, twinkle toes.
What we need is a diversion.

14:24.750 --> 14:27.083
Now where are we going to get a diversion?

14:27.166 --> 14:28.917
You think they grow on trees?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.000
Trust me.

14:31.166 --> 14:32.750
[whistles]

14:32.834 --> 14:34.667
Hey, Captain Karnage!

14:34.750 --> 14:37.083
That fat bear is here to rescue the kid!

14:37.166 --> 14:41.125
-Hey, are you nuts?
-And he's got the bird!

14:41.208 --> 14:45.709
Do not just stand there like logs...
Get me that bird!

14:45.792 --> 14:47.625
[overlapping dialogue]

14:52.375 --> 14:54.917
Now that's what I call a diversion.

14:55.041 --> 14:57.792
Ignatz!
I knew you'd be back.

14:57.875 --> 15:01.583
I know these guys are a lot of laughs,
but it's time to beat it.

15:02.542 --> 15:05.709
Don't look now, captain,
but the kid has escaped.

15:05.792 --> 15:07.959
What? Escaped?

15:08.041 --> 15:10.583
Hey, you very ugly pirates,

15:10.667 --> 15:13.792
stop playing with the bear
and come here!

15:16.041 --> 15:17.792
Had enough, huh?

15:19.000 --> 15:21.375
Well, you're not getting off that easy.

15:21.458 --> 15:23.583
[laughing]
Very good.

15:23.667 --> 15:27.417
You've brought reinforcements.
You two follow me.

15:27.500 --> 15:30.792
The rest of you,
spread out and find that boy.

15:32.208 --> 15:35.542
Take that... and that.

15:35.625 --> 15:38.291
Will you stop dancing
so we can get out of here?

15:38.375 --> 15:39.834
Make with the feet!

15:54.542 --> 15:57.291
-What about the treasure?
-Yeah, Baloo.

15:57.375 --> 16:00.166
Kit, that was Don Karnage out there!

16:00.250 --> 16:02.792
[Kit]
But we've got to go back for it, Baloo.

16:06.208 --> 16:09.834
What we gotta do
is get away from those pirates!

16:09.917 --> 16:12.959
I know how we can get away from them
and get back to the treasure.

16:13.041 --> 16:14.625
[Kit]
Baloo, please, give him a chance.

16:14.709 --> 16:18.250
-He got me away from the pirates.
-He got me pulverized.

16:18.333 --> 16:20.208
The bird is bad news.

16:20.291 --> 16:24.166
So, take me to the treasure,
and I'm out of your life forever.

16:24.250 --> 16:28.500
-I promise.
-Now you're talking my language!

16:35.375 --> 16:38.083
When I catch that bothersome Baloo,

16:38.166 --> 16:41.750
I'll tear him into
itsy-bitsy pieces of ugly bear,

16:41.834 --> 16:44.625
and then I sew him back together
with dull needles!

16:45.834 --> 16:47.458
[Ignatz] Oh, no!

17:02.458 --> 17:06.165
And there's Carlsbear Caverns.
That's where the loot's stashed.

17:06.250 --> 17:07.625
Land as close as you can.

17:07.709 --> 17:08.959
[gunfire]

17:16.791 --> 17:21.583
[Don Karnage] They cannot escape
Don Karnage, the prince of pirates!

17:25.916 --> 17:29.041
Lucky I had
my new ejection seat installed!

17:31.291 --> 17:33.792
[yelling]

17:42.041 --> 17:44.166
[Don Karnage]
What a lousy place for a wall.

17:44.250 --> 17:46.667
[Baloo]
Now we're cooking with gas.

17:50.542 --> 17:52.875
Are you all right, captain?

17:54.959 --> 17:57.583
[groans]
It's just fine.

17:57.667 --> 17:59.125
After them!

18:04.583 --> 18:07.583
OK, here's us.
Where's the treasure?

18:09.125 --> 18:13.834
-There! We have to go through that tunnel.
-Why can't we go this way?

18:14.166 --> 18:16.792
Well, that'll get you to the treasure,
but you won't like the trip.

18:16.875 --> 18:19.083
Why don't you let me decide that.

18:19.583 --> 18:21.750
[Ignatz] Remember what happened
when you didn't trust me?

18:21.834 --> 18:25.333
[chuckles] I remember what happened
when I did trust you.

18:26.125 --> 18:28.458
-Ol' Juan Toomany hated company.
-[rumbling]

18:32.333 --> 18:33.625
Kit!

18:42.333 --> 18:43.667
Kit!

18:43.750 --> 18:48.875
If you want your young friend back,
in just one pieces, give me the bird.

18:48.959 --> 18:50.083
Follow me.

18:50.166 --> 18:52.500
I really think I'd be
a good idea for you to move.

18:52.583 --> 18:55.291
Once a booby starts a trap,
it doesn't stop.

18:55.375 --> 18:57.166
And leave Kit?
Forget...

18:57.250 --> 18:59.083
-[rumbling]
-[yells]

18:59.917 --> 19:01.792
Whoa!

19:04.959 --> 19:06.834
[yelling]

19:08.333 --> 19:09.500
[grunts]

19:09.583 --> 19:11.917
Oh, my aching...

19:12.917 --> 19:14.750
Jewels!

19:14.834 --> 19:16.875
Well, you found the treasure your way.

19:16.959 --> 19:18.834
Oh, boy! Oh, boy!

19:18.917 --> 19:22.917
Wait'll Kit gets a load... Kit!
I have to save Kit.

19:23.000 --> 19:25.542
You?
You're not even a good diversion.

19:25.625 --> 19:29.959
-I'll save him... again.
-Listen, I don't need you.

19:30.041 --> 19:33.125
Who's been insulting me
since the day we met?

19:33.208 --> 19:36.041
Who's deserved being insulted, fat head?

19:36.125 --> 19:38.291
-Cracker breath!
-Doofus!

19:38.375 --> 19:41.291
[both]
The only good thing about you is Kit!

19:45.542 --> 19:48.250
So, what are we waiting for?

19:48.333 --> 19:51.458
Yeah, let's go see a pirate about a kid.

19:51.542 --> 19:54.917
You'd better get that
annoying bird back here

19:55.000 --> 19:57.542
if you ever want to see
sociable insecurity.

19:57.625 --> 20:01.500
I don't see how we're ever going
to get Kit away from those bozos.

20:01.583 --> 20:02.792
Well, we have to do something

20:02.875 --> 20:06.125
before one of those idiots
trips Juan Toomany's big trap.

20:06.208 --> 20:10.417
Relax.
That would take somebody really dumb.

20:10.750 --> 20:12.458
[rumbling]

20:12.542 --> 20:13.625
Right again, Baloo.

20:15.959 --> 20:17.500
Oh!
[yelling]

20:17.583 --> 20:20.375
I hate this part!
[yelling]

20:23.333 --> 20:24.291
[yells]

20:24.375 --> 20:25.709
Hey! Help!

20:25.792 --> 20:27.333
[crying]

20:27.834 --> 20:29.041
[wincing]

20:29.125 --> 20:31.417
What is the matter with you?

20:32.166 --> 20:34.000
-Ow!
-Kit!

20:34.083 --> 20:36.208
[yelling]

20:36.917 --> 20:38.792
That's far enough.

20:38.875 --> 20:41.083
All right, you nasty bird...

20:42.125 --> 20:43.500
Mama...

20:43.583 --> 20:46.208
[all yelling]

20:47.208 --> 20:48.834
Let's make tracks.

20:59.375 --> 21:01.542
Well, so much for the treasure.

21:02.000 --> 21:06.667
[Baloo] Yeah, but I got us out
of there alive, and that's what counts.

21:06.750 --> 21:09.750
[Ignatz] You got us out?
You almost got us squashed.

21:09.834 --> 21:11.875
[Baloo laughs]
That's rich!

21:11.959 --> 21:14.041
Why, if it hadn't been for me....

21:15.083 --> 21:19.500
Got to be some way I can pay Rebecca
back that 500 smackers.

21:20.542 --> 21:23.041
This what you're moping about,
sweet cheeks?

21:23.583 --> 21:26.959
What? How did you get a hold
of that kind of money?

21:27.041 --> 21:30.375
I just signed on
with the Museum of History.

21:30.458 --> 21:31.834
I'm going to tell the tale

21:31.917 --> 21:36.625
of how I single-handedly saved you
from a fate worse than death.

21:36.709 --> 21:40.542
I suppose we should be glad you found
something that your big mouth is good for.

21:40.625 --> 21:44.250
Listen, Baloo, I know the last thing
you want from me is a favor,

21:44.333 --> 21:48.667
but I figure I owe my buddy, Kit,
a small token of my esteem.

21:48.750 --> 21:52.375
Of course, what Kit does with it
is none of my business.

21:52.458 --> 21:54.959
See you 'round!
[squawks]

21:56.583 --> 21:59.750
Well, what do you think
of birds now, Baloo?

21:59.834 --> 22:05.333
I'll tell you, little britches,
I may never eat fried chicken again.
