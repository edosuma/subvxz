01:20.380 --> 01:22.575
They call them
the Cocaine Cowboys.

01:22.649 --> 01:25.140
Yesterday they attacked
Dadeland Mall

01:25.218 --> 01:28.051
and they executed two Latins males
in the Crown liquor store.

01:28.121 --> 01:30.612
There was an exchange of fire bewteen the two groups.

01:30.690 --> 01:32.487
The broken glass and liqour bottles flying.

01:32.559 --> 01:33.685
The shooting continued out.

01:33.760 --> 01:35.591
Two men,
murdered in a hail of gun fire.

01:35.662 --> 01:37.755
Victims of the antidrug fight in Miami.

01:37.831 --> 01:39.025
The one that escaped had a machine gun.

01:39.099 --> 01:40.760
They have to stop this.

01:40.834 --> 01:42.324
What are they going to do about it?

01:42.402 --> 01:43.562
What can they going to do about it?

01:43.636 --> 01:45.160
People from Florida wonder

01:45.238 --> 01:47.900
where they will attack now
the Cocaine Cowboys.

02:40.260 --> 02:42.956
My name is Jon Roberts.

02:43.029 --> 02:46.590
I was born in New York and I got involved

02:46.666 --> 02:48.634
with some Italian from New York

02:48.701 --> 02:51.898
that they were part of a family of the mafia.

02:51.971 --> 02:55.065
We open 4 or 5 night clubs
of great fame

02:55.141 --> 02:57.371
and he/she went us very well.

02:58.578 --> 03:01.069
February 17 1970

03:01.147 --> 03:03.377
One day the police came.

03:03.449 --> 03:04.814
Not we knew why they came.

03:04.884 --> 03:06.749
They told us
that they found our partner

03:06.819 --> 03:08.616
in the freeway of Long Island.

03:08.688 --> 03:10.019
They had murdered it and he/she had

03:10.089 --> 03:12.250
eleven bullet holes.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.122
Who Io that happened knows.

03:14.194 --> 03:16.059
The best thing that was happened
in that moment

03:16.129 --> 03:19.326
it was to take away from that tangle.

03:19.399 --> 03:22.562
So I moved here

03:22.635 --> 03:25.695
and I began in the business of the cocaine.

03:29.309 --> 03:31.641
JON ROBERTS
Trafficker of cocaine

03:32.111 --> 03:35.979
It distributed cocaine for value
of more than 2000 million dollars

03:36.049 --> 03:37.516
for the poster of Medellan.

03:41.387 --> 03:44.481
The city in Miami was very calm

03:44.557 --> 03:47.117
and it was a very pleasant place where to live.

03:47.193 --> 03:48.956
Before 1956,

03:49.028 --> 03:51.360
the shift at night of the police

03:51.431 --> 03:52.955
he/she had a patrol one

03:53.032 --> 03:55.830
to patrol an area
of the size of Rhode Island.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.426
In that Miami was then, the south,

03:57.503 --> 03:58.800
it was as Alabama.

03:58.871 --> 04:00.862
Not there was money here.
Not there were buildings

04:00.940 --> 04:02.601
and the center was lonely.

04:02.675 --> 04:05.041
In Miami Beach had bigger people

04:05.111 --> 04:06.976
the time passing in rockers

04:07.046 --> 04:08.775
waiting to the death.

04:08.848 --> 04:11.282
The life was very different here, then.

04:11.351 --> 04:13.876
It is for this reason that Miami is exactly for you.

04:16.623 --> 04:19.786
In the 60s and 70s Miami flourished

04:19.858 --> 04:21.622
as vacation dstination.

04:21.694 --> 04:22.991
To Sunshine.
To Sunshine.

04:23.062 --> 04:25.792
To Sunshine. Channel 4 News.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.401
Sun and amusement in the beach,
the palms.

04:34.607 --> 04:36.871
Miami is a center of transport
important

04:36.943 --> 04:41.175
and he/she has easy access with
all the modalities of transport.

04:41.247 --> 04:44.683
At the end of the 70s,
South American immigrants' thousands

04:44.751 --> 04:47.845
legal and illegal Ilegaron to Miami.

04:47.920 --> 04:49.285
The Latin American influence

04:49.355 --> 04:52.085
he/she gives an unique flavor to Miami.

04:52.158 --> 04:53.887
Miami had settled down

04:53.960 --> 04:55.518
as a place

04:55.595 --> 04:58.564
where the Spanish-speakers
they could prosper.

04:58.631 --> 05:00.098
Miami was always

05:00.166 --> 05:01.599
a place half pirate,

05:01.668 --> 05:04.603
ferociously independent,

05:04.671 --> 05:07.640
where one never pled
for the law and the order.

05:07.707 --> 05:08.867
As a virgin city.

05:16.115 --> 05:17.878
I am a boy from Florida of the South.

05:17.950 --> 05:20.885
Old one of the few ones born here.

05:20.953 --> 05:22.921
I was devoted to the import.

05:26.526 --> 05:28.289
MICKEY MUNDAY
Trafficker of drugs

05:28.561 --> 05:31.257
It transported more than 38 tons
of cocaine of Colombia to EE UU

05:31.331 --> 05:32.662
It digs deep

05:32.732 --> 05:34.029
and you will see the traffickers of weapons,

05:34.100 --> 05:35.362
to the smugglers of rum,

05:35.435 --> 05:36.766
you will find the marijuana,

05:36.836 --> 05:38.804
the Cuban immigrants,

05:38.871 --> 05:40.168
and lastly, the cocaine.

05:40.239 --> 05:43.265
There is always something entering to the city.

05:43.343 --> 05:46.244
Florida of the South is the destination
of EE nearer UU

05:46.312 --> 05:48.143
for the South American traffickers.

05:48.214 --> 05:50.705
- It was very open, then.
- It was very open.

05:50.783 --> 05:53.343
Kilometer after kilometer
of costs without patrolling,

05:53.419 --> 05:55.751
where they can leave
the drug without being seen.

05:55.822 --> 05:58.120
When IleguÃ©, in the 70s,

05:58.191 --> 06:00.682
all entered drug in Florida.

06:00.760 --> 06:02.227
The Antidrug Agency believes

06:02.295 --> 06:06.425
that 95% of the marijuana
that it enters in EE UU,

06:06.499 --> 06:08.364
he/she enters for Florida of the South.

06:08.434 --> 06:11.369
My friend died in his deposit.

06:11.437 --> 06:15.168
He/she had 900 kg of marijuana.

06:15.241 --> 06:17.709
That made it was to go and to take off it.

06:17.777 --> 06:19.108
Not he/she knew anybody in the business,

06:19.178 --> 06:20.873
so I gave the half to somebody

06:20.947 --> 06:22.073
and the other one to somebody more,

06:22.148 --> 06:23.172
and Io divided with them.

06:23.249 --> 06:25.080
If you won 10.000 dollars to the anus,

06:25.151 --> 06:26.277
he/she went you very well.

06:26.352 --> 06:27.614
If you won 20.000 dollars,

06:27.687 --> 06:28.676
he/she went you better than well.

06:28.755 --> 06:31.656
I won as 165.000 dollars.

06:31.724 --> 06:35.888
It is as the salary of 8 years.

06:35.962 --> 06:39.125
And I told myself: "This is very pretty,

06:39.198 --> 06:42.224
he/she has to have something more. It was very easy."

06:42.301 --> 06:43.962
You arrived with your boat Ileno,

06:44.036 --> 06:45.367
you robbed in the jetty

06:45.438 --> 06:46.996
and Io discharged. Nobody said anything.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.268
Let us say that they didn't watch over the frontier.

06:49.342 --> 06:50.832
To the present rhythm, according to

06:50.910 --> 06:52.309
some economists,

06:52.378 --> 06:56.405
the biggest industry
it could be soon the traffic of drugs.

06:56.482 --> 06:57.540
You went out with your boat

06:57.617 --> 07:00.313
and you found bales
of marijuana floating.

07:00.386 --> 07:04.720
Let us say, the square traditional fish.

07:04.791 --> 07:06.190
The Colombians realized

07:06.259 --> 07:08.727
that they had a mine of gold,
and when they sent

07:08.795 --> 07:10.695
all this marijuana, they also sent

07:10.763 --> 07:12.128
some kilos of coca.

07:12.198 --> 07:13.722
At the beginning it was a little...

07:13.800 --> 07:15.290
Because it was very expensive.

07:15.368 --> 07:16.858
They entered her in a valise...

07:16.936 --> 07:18.130
And it was not noticed this way so much.

07:18.204 --> 07:20.968
It was quoted extremely expensive.

07:21.040 --> 07:24.441
By the middle of the 70, the experience
of the Antidrug Agency it was low.

07:24.510 --> 07:27.308
The office didn't treat matters of cocaine.

07:27.380 --> 07:30.042
Not we have a problem
in the national environment

07:30.116 --> 07:33.950
given the great number
of people that consumes cocaine.

07:34.020 --> 07:37.820
Yes it is a serious problem
for a certain minority.

07:37.890 --> 07:40.415
I met a Cuban in Hialeah

07:40.493 --> 07:42.484
that you Ilamaba Albert Sanpedro.

07:42.562 --> 07:44.655
Most of the Cubans
Io got everything

07:44.730 --> 07:47.028
of the Colombians because, obviously,

07:47.099 --> 07:48.532
them Io controlled everything.

07:48.601 --> 07:49.693
In the traffic of drugs,

07:49.769 --> 07:51.634
the organizations
cubanoestadounidenses

07:51.704 --> 07:53.763
they are allied with the Colombians.

07:53.840 --> 07:56.570
The Colombians care the drug
and the Cubans distribute it.

07:56.642 --> 07:59.110
Albert gave me 100 grams

07:59.178 --> 08:00.907
and I had about four days.

08:00.980 --> 08:03.244
Then I went and him Ilevaba the money.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.840
Then he/she gave me other 100 grams

08:04.917 --> 08:07.078
and I believe that he/she used to pay him/her near...

08:07.153 --> 08:10.213
about 800 each 30 grams, there for the 70.

08:10.289 --> 08:11.756
Not it was of great quality,

08:11.824 --> 08:13.382
but many didn't know the difference.

08:13.459 --> 08:15.051
They saw those big stones and they thought:

08:15.127 --> 08:17.459
"This yes that is good" and my clients

08:17.530 --> 08:19.794
they were not people
as people he/she imagined,

08:19.866 --> 08:20.890
they were not people of the street.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.025
If somebody had cocaine,

08:22.101 --> 08:23.466
he/she had to be an airline pilot.

08:23.536 --> 08:24.833
Real estate agents.

08:24.904 --> 08:25.962
Grant a doctorate, lawyers.

08:26.038 --> 08:28.097
He/she had doctors and lawyers.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.267
Somebody that could pay it.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.708
They were the weekend warriors.

08:31.777 --> 08:33.142
During the week they didn't make anything,

08:33.212 --> 08:35.077
but from Friday at night

08:35.147 --> 08:36.511
until Sunday, they consumed.

08:36.582 --> 08:39.346
And each one showed up to a friend.

08:39.418 --> 08:41.318
And I passed this way of 120 grams

08:41.386 --> 08:43.217
at 240, until the 500 grams,

08:43.289 --> 08:45.416
and in one month he/she was selling

08:45.491 --> 08:48.688
maybe 2, 3 kilos per week
to the doctors and their friends.

08:48.761 --> 08:50.490
When IleguÃ© from New York,

08:50.563 --> 08:52.793
he/she had 650 dollars in the pocket

08:52.865 --> 08:55.060
and then it won 20.000,
30.000 dollars per week

08:55.134 --> 08:56.897
in this business.

08:56.969 --> 08:58.664
A friend from New York

08:58.738 --> 09:01.673
it had developed
a great business in California,

09:01.741 --> 09:03.208
in San Francisco's bay.

09:03.276 --> 09:05.039
He/she sold Oakland Raiders,

09:05.111 --> 09:07.238
he/she sold Grateful Dead.

09:07.313 --> 09:09.804
He/she knew a stewardess that worked

09:09.882 --> 09:11.349
for National Airlines.

09:11.417 --> 09:13.248
So we sent the coca with the stewardess.

09:13.319 --> 09:15.583
She went of here to San Francisco

09:15.655 --> 09:17.452
and we sent to any place

09:17.523 --> 09:20.117
from 5 to 10 kilos per week.
I won

09:20.192 --> 09:22.456
a lot of money, was close

09:22.528 --> 09:25.622
of the 200.000 to 300.000 dollars
and I began to know types--

09:25.698 --> 09:28.030
Mercury Morris,
player of Dolphins,

09:28.100 --> 09:30.125
who went to the jail,
so it is not secret.

09:30.202 --> 09:31.760
Merc is a fallen angel

09:31.837 --> 09:33.464
of the sport machine of Miami.

09:33.539 --> 09:34.972
Former Dolphins, Don Reese

09:35.041 --> 09:37.942
and Randy Crowder
they were also arrested

09:38.010 --> 09:40.137
in a transaction of cocaine.

09:40.212 --> 09:41.577
I remember the week of Super Bowl,

09:41.647 --> 09:43.205
when Dallas faced here Pittsburgh.

09:43.282 --> 09:45.273
Two nights before
he/she had to the regular leading

09:45.351 --> 09:48.320
of Pittsburgh Steelers
sat down in my house.

09:48.387 --> 09:50.378
"We go, we go,
damages the coca, damages the coca."

09:50.456 --> 09:52.424
Not we have opportunity
of enjoying the festejos

09:52.491 --> 09:55.289
and of the parties
because we have touches of it is.

09:55.361 --> 09:57.488
They left to have a good time and Io made to big Io.

09:57.563 --> 10:00.555
* We go, Steelers, we go *

10:00.633 --> 10:03.033
Not they have idea of
with what these types were drugged.

10:03.102 --> 10:04.831
"? Van to play this Sunday?"

10:04.904 --> 10:07.270
"Yes, and we will win."

10:07.340 --> 10:08.864
They played and they won,

10:08.941 --> 10:09.908
it didn't affect them.

10:09.976 --> 10:11.876
The offensive line
he/she made an excellent work.

10:11.944 --> 10:14.174
The popularity began to grow,

10:14.246 --> 10:16.737
and all those that before
they consumed marijuana,

10:16.816 --> 10:18.283
now they consumed cocaine.

10:18.351 --> 10:19.909
We continue with the marijuana

10:19.986 --> 10:22.352
until IlegÃ³ the moment
in that there was too much

10:22.421 --> 10:24.787
and one could not sell.

10:24.857 --> 10:27.121
But one was not able to
to get enough cocaine.

10:27.193 --> 10:28.490
I looked like each other that the best way

10:28.561 --> 10:30.358
it was to be devoted to transport it.

10:30.429 --> 10:31.896
You don't buy it, you don't sell it,

10:31.964 --> 10:35.127
you don't consume it, alone you care her.

10:35.201 --> 10:37.897
The Colombians offered us a sum

10:37.970 --> 10:40.063
with the one that we were
more than of agreement.

10:40.139 --> 10:41.731
3000 dollars for piece,

10:41.807 --> 10:43.331
or a kilo in your terms.

10:43.409 --> 10:46.003
They wanted to move about 400 at least,

10:46.078 --> 10:48.740
so we were and in the first trip,

10:48.814 --> 10:53.183
they paid us 1,2 million dollars.

10:53.252 --> 10:55.015
It was enough to get excited.

10:55.087 --> 10:57.783
He/she hears, let us maybe stay
in the business a time.

11:00.626 --> 11:02.116
People with which tried

11:02.194 --> 11:03.718
he/she had limited supplies

11:04.163 --> 11:05.221
and while, people to which sold him/her

11:05.297 --> 11:08.266
it expanded their business.
I could no longer get enough.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.131
A type requested me 15 kilos

11:10.202 --> 11:12.193
or 20, or 25 kilos,

11:12.271 --> 11:14.637
and alone he/she could give him/her 15 or 10,
and it was money

11:14.707 --> 11:16.072
that it left my pocket.

11:16.142 --> 11:19.634
He/she could sell 100 kilos
per week with easiness.

11:19.712 --> 11:23.409
I was lucky.
I believe that in 1979

11:23.482 --> 11:24.642
I met a girl.

11:24.717 --> 11:27.015
I Flew to Miami

11:27.086 --> 11:29.884
and I worked in a session
of pictures with a girl.

11:29.955 --> 11:34.892
He/she told me that he/she wanted
that he/she knew somebody.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.861
My friend hooked me with her,
he was a lawyer.

11:37.930 --> 11:39.955
ÃI went out with a beautiful girl,

11:40.032 --> 11:41.624
that it was model of Ford.

11:45.638 --> 11:49.438
To the 3 months of knowing Jon
it was my birthday

11:49.508 --> 11:52.102
and I entered to the garage and there was a new Porsche.

11:52.178 --> 11:53.736
It Was a Porsche Targa Career.

11:53.813 --> 11:59.376
He/she had a great monkey above,
a red monkey, on behalf of him.

11:59.452 --> 12:02.046
Him ours was as a vortex.

12:02.121 --> 12:07.320
We were very in love.
We were...

12:11.030 --> 12:12.395
They counted me

12:12.465 --> 12:14.365
that he/she had discos in Manhattan.

12:14.433 --> 12:15.764
We begin to leave

12:15.835 --> 12:18.030
and she saw that I won't work.

12:18.104 --> 12:20.038
If he/she wanted to go to New York, there he/she went,

12:20.106 --> 12:22.131
and she had curiosity.
I am a person

12:22.208 --> 12:23.903
very direct, so you Io counted.

12:23.976 --> 12:25.341
"I am devoted to this."

12:25.411 --> 12:26.935
"If you don't want to see me more, it is well."

12:27.012 --> 12:29.105
He/she told me that he/she had a friend

12:29.181 --> 12:31.445
that he/she was a pilot
and that he/she worked for the Colombians.

12:31.517 --> 12:33.781
The type shows up,
you Ilama Mickey Munday

12:33.853 --> 12:35.684
and it is an uncultured type of Florida

12:35.755 --> 12:37.120
that all its life lived here.

12:37.189 --> 12:39.089
The type didn't please well.

12:39.158 --> 12:40.455
The first time that Io saw, it managed

12:40.526 --> 12:42.824
a black Mercedes of two doors.

12:42.895 --> 12:45.090
It was very obvious that trafficked with drugs.

12:45.164 --> 12:47.724
Mickey Munday transported
with a lot of success

12:47.800 --> 12:49.768
For years for this people.

12:49.835 --> 12:52.668
It was extravagant, he/she resembled somebody

12:52.738 --> 12:55.400
with who I didn't want to involve me.

12:55.474 --> 12:57.942
I say... ?Do they remind the series MacGyver?

12:58.010 --> 12:59.272
ÃI is that type.

12:59.345 --> 13:01.279
He/she made incredible things.

13:01.347 --> 13:04.248
It was an astute type,
but I didn't like their cars.

13:04.316 --> 13:05.908
For me, it was seen as all the other ones

13:05.985 --> 13:07.009
of that business.

13:07.086 --> 13:08.713
My business overcame that of the Cubans

13:08.788 --> 13:11.052
and it was a necessity
to find a Colombian

13:11.123 --> 13:12.818
that it could provide
the big quantities

13:12.892 --> 13:14.689
that he/she needed.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.489
He/she told me: I can connect you.

13:16.562 --> 13:19.122
"You IlevarÃ© with the Colombians

13:19.198 --> 13:21.393
"and they will give you Io that you want."

13:21.467 --> 13:23.367
He/she had heard many histories of those,

13:23.435 --> 13:25.903
so I told him/her
that me Ilevara when he/she wanted.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.269
We went until Sunny Isles, Florida.

13:28.340 --> 13:29.864
We enter in a house

13:29.942 --> 13:32.172
where there were 5 or 6 Colombians,

13:32.244 --> 13:33.677
and they were armed,

13:33.746 --> 13:35.077
armed until the teeth.

13:35.147 --> 13:36.808
They had guns, machine guns,

13:36.882 --> 13:38.349
all stopped ones were

13:38.417 --> 13:41.011
and there I realized that the type was serious.

13:41.086 --> 13:42.144
They went seriously, because people

13:42.221 --> 13:43.745
it is not stopped this way.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.017
I knew to this type

13:45.090 --> 13:47.217
that it doesn't measure more than 1,60 or 1,62 m.

13:47.293 --> 13:49.284
He/she shows up and he/she says: "Me Ilamo Rafa.

13:49.361 --> 13:50.885
"I can give you

13:50.963 --> 13:53.261
"Io that you want, old. If you have money,

13:53.332 --> 13:54.924
"I will advance you twice as much

13:55.000 --> 13:56.661
"of Io that you have brought."

13:56.735 --> 13:59.533
Then I request him/her
that it shows me a little.

13:59.605 --> 14:01.573
Me Ileva to another room, presses on a button

14:01.640 --> 14:03.301
and a wall opens up.

14:03.375 --> 14:06.037
Never in my life he/she had seen so much cocaine,

14:06.111 --> 14:07.772
hidden behind a wall.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.610
I said: " I believe that you can help me.

14:09.682 --> 14:11.980
"Give me one day to join the money

14:12.051 --> 14:13.348
"and I will return."

14:13.419 --> 14:16.081
The following day, there was an American.

14:16.155 --> 14:17.816
ÃI me Io presents

14:17.890 --> 14:19.380
and he/she tells me that he/she is their godfather.

14:19.458 --> 14:20.720
"Not I am a lot in the city,

14:20.793 --> 14:22.920
"but when you need something,
he is the suitable one,

14:22.995 --> 14:24.485
"he/she will take care of you and...

14:24.563 --> 14:27.760
"don't worry, he is 100% of trusting."

14:27.833 --> 14:30.233
The man that presented me

14:30.302 --> 14:31.769
he/she was Max Mermelstein.

14:31.837 --> 14:33.361
Jon introduced me to Max.

14:33.439 --> 14:35.600
I believed that Max, in that then,
he/she was a good person,

14:35.674 --> 14:37.505
a person of trusting.

14:37.576 --> 14:40.943
Max seemed a good type.

14:41.013 --> 14:43.481
At least Io seemed.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.073
At the beginning, Max gave me

14:45.150 --> 14:47.277
75, 100 kilos per week.

14:47.353 --> 14:48.911
With the time he/she saw that I went seriously

14:48.988 --> 14:50.546
and that this was given every week.

14:50.623 --> 14:52.716
When you pay
a million dollars per week,

14:52.791 --> 14:55.021
suddenly he/she is formed...

14:55.094 --> 14:57.153
a knot among people.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.959
Max wanted me to take charge of the business,

15:00.032 --> 15:01.522
to go to Colombia, to fix the trips.

15:01.600 --> 15:04.000
"If Io divides with me,
you will make much more money

15:04.069 --> 15:06.560
"and you can continue
providing who you want."

15:06.639 --> 15:08.402
And Max sent me to Colombia.

15:08.674 --> 15:10.699
This is the municipality Envigado of MedellÃ­n.

15:10.776 --> 15:13.108
It is where the bosses of the cocaine meet.

15:13.178 --> 15:14.907
I met with Rafa

15:14.980 --> 15:17.414
and I showed up
to people with the one that worked.

15:17.483 --> 15:18.882
Let us say that we knew

15:18.951 --> 15:22.250
to the elite of the business
of the drug of Colombia.

15:22.321 --> 15:24.448
They Were Ochoa and...

15:24.523 --> 15:25.683
- Pablo Escobar.
- People of the one that...

15:25.758 --> 15:27.487
...it was read in the books.
- Carlos Lehder.

15:27.559 --> 15:29.026
And me, a boy from New York,

15:29.094 --> 15:30.755
that he/she never thought that this could pass him/her.

15:30.829 --> 15:32.023
They pretended to have

15:32.097 --> 15:34.065
an enormous office with computers

15:34.133 --> 15:35.930
and with 40 secretaries, but they were a group

15:36.001 --> 15:38.561
of vague, a group of street hoodlums

15:38.637 --> 15:40.264
that they were lucky.

15:42.041 --> 15:43.099
Let us put it in a way

15:43.175 --> 15:45.075
in that the Americans
they can understand it.

15:45.144 --> 15:47.612
Here they are accustomed
to the Italian and the mafia.

15:47.680 --> 15:48.908
The Colombians have his Io.

15:48.981 --> 15:51.347
It is a mafia,
but it is the Colombian mafia.

15:51.417 --> 15:54.352
Alone I knew to a family
in that time.

15:54.420 --> 15:56.047
The family era of MedellÃ­n.

15:56.121 --> 15:57.679
The family Ochoa

15:57.756 --> 16:01.123
it was a family
of very respected farmers,

16:01.193 --> 16:02.660
with a lot of influence

16:02.728 --> 16:05.288
in their native city of MedellÃ­n, Colombia.

16:05.364 --> 16:06.490
And of course,

16:06.565 --> 16:08.533
they have the captain, and to the head, the boss.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.568
A lot of people want to believe

16:10.636 --> 16:13.833
that Pablo Escobar was the king of the cocaine.

16:13.906 --> 16:15.066
Because that Io believes,

16:15.140 --> 16:18.405
but the true king was Ochoa.

16:18.477 --> 16:20.638
And it was not Fabito, the poor person, but the old one.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.648
The old one was the silent man
that he/she never went to the jail

16:23.716 --> 16:25.775
and who controlled Escobar.

16:25.851 --> 16:29.082
Fabio Ochoa, patriarch of the family Ochoa

16:29.154 --> 16:30.849
of the poster of MedellÃ­n.

16:30.923 --> 16:33.517
It is said that they created

16:33.592 --> 16:36.993
an insurance of transport
for the traffic of cocaine in Colombia.

16:37.062 --> 16:38.757
Rafa was as a lieutenant,

16:38.831 --> 16:41.891
and it almost controlled each kilo of coca

16:41.967 --> 16:43.332
that he/she entered in this country.

16:43.402 --> 16:44.630
Through people from MedellÃ­n,

16:44.703 --> 16:46.933
Rafa knew Io that entered and he/she knew

16:47.006 --> 16:49.406
who you Io Ilevaba
and how much it won for each one.

16:49.475 --> 16:52.035
And he/she made them win... I cannot believe it.

16:52.111 --> 16:54.170
Millions are not enough,

16:54.246 --> 16:56.908
he/she made them win
more than millions to this people.

16:56.982 --> 16:58.279
Not there was nobody above of him

16:58.350 --> 17:00.215
in the poster of MedellÃ­n in this country.

17:00.285 --> 17:02.116
He/she had many soldiers,

17:02.187 --> 17:04.416
as the soldiers of the mafia
that they worked for him.

17:04.490 --> 17:05.888
Some sold drug,

17:05.958 --> 17:07.220
others imposed the force.

17:07.291 --> 17:09.453
He/she had accountants, lawyers.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.654
In their opinion?these types

17:10.729 --> 17:12.162
the Horsemen of the Cocaine are not?

17:12.231 --> 17:13.630
Of course that not.

17:13.699 --> 17:14.893
ÃI had of everything in this country,

17:14.967 --> 17:16.559
and it was a well formed group.

17:16.635 --> 17:18.262
Not they are different people

17:18.337 --> 17:20.464
those that send the merchandise,
it is an organization,

17:20.539 --> 17:22.165
the poster of MedellÃ­n.

17:22.241 --> 17:25.267
The federal ones accuse
to the poster of controlling the 80%

17:25.344 --> 17:27.904
of the cocaine that enters EE UU.

17:27.980 --> 17:30.312
The authorities say:
"These three men

17:30.382 --> 17:32.782
"they manage a more violent organization

17:32.851 --> 17:35.342
"and similar of powerful
that the mafia in EE UU."

17:35.421 --> 17:37.616
For my experience
with the mafia of New York

17:37.689 --> 17:38.986
and with the Colombians,

17:39.058 --> 17:40.616
the Colombians
they made much more money

17:40.692 --> 17:42.091
in much less time

17:42.161 --> 17:44.857
of the one that the mafia never sounded to make.

17:44.930 --> 17:46.227
They had farms,

17:46.298 --> 17:48.562
Ilamaban properties, Ilenas

17:48.634 --> 17:51.125
of cocaine,
because they constantly took place.

17:51.203 --> 17:53.103
They had to types
that they chewed leaves the whole night.

17:53.172 --> 17:55.663
They worked in the factories
chewing the leaves.

17:55.741 --> 17:58.437
These types worked without stopping.

17:58.510 --> 18:00.410
And there there is not industry.

18:00.479 --> 18:02.777
They were earned a living harvesting this.

18:02.848 --> 18:04.782
These farmers and poor workers

18:04.850 --> 18:06.750
they received a lot of money to make this.

18:06.819 --> 18:11.188
It was an entire process,
as if it was a factory.

18:11.256 --> 18:13.383
We worked with radios of short wave,

18:13.459 --> 18:15.290
we didn't use the telephones

18:15.360 --> 18:18.227
as you leave in the movies.

18:18.297 --> 18:19.992
"Does he/she hear?how do the things go in Colombia?

18:20.065 --> 18:22.659
"I need 600 kilos."
No, it was not this way.

18:23.001 --> 18:24.662
We had antennas that came out of the floor

18:24.736 --> 18:27.466
and Ilegaban to the 25 meters high.

18:27.539 --> 18:29.734
In a certain schedule
they fastened the short wave,

18:29.808 --> 18:33.471
we fastened the radios
and we communicated this way.

18:33.545 --> 18:35.877
At this hour in Miami

18:35.948 --> 18:37.040
in a band of short wave

18:37.116 --> 18:39.778
that most cannot syntonize,

18:39.852 --> 18:42.878
Ilegan the coded instructions
from a transmitter

18:42.955 --> 18:44.718
in MedellÃ­n, Colombia,

18:44.790 --> 18:46.587
of the members of the organization

18:46.658 --> 18:48.626
more big of the world
of the traffic of drugs.

18:50.062 --> 18:51.689
The livestock is clever,

18:51.763 --> 18:52.787
the livestock is clever.

18:54.500 --> 18:55.831
At 8 o'clock on the dot.

18:55.901 --> 18:57.459
At 8 o'clock for first o'clock.

18:57.536 --> 18:59.629
We fixed this way the trips,

18:59.705 --> 19:02.196
and the Colombians hired us.

19:02.274 --> 19:03.764
I made the arrangements

19:03.842 --> 19:06.208
and they said: We "have 1000 kilos,

19:06.278 --> 19:07.540
"it passes to look for them."

19:07.613 --> 19:09.547
On the mountains,
slipping for the valley,

19:09.615 --> 19:10.673
this way nobody would see us.

19:10.749 --> 19:12.478
We never had landing problems

19:12.551 --> 19:13.848
or of take off.

19:13.919 --> 19:16.547
Everything was paid there,
the government worked with them

19:16.622 --> 19:18.385
and there we sent the airplane.

19:18.457 --> 19:21.255
The Colombians didn't have...

19:21.326 --> 19:22.918
Io that made didn't know.

19:22.995 --> 19:24.690
99% of the runways

19:24.763 --> 19:27.288
they were of powder, of grass,
people that worked there.

19:27.366 --> 19:29.425
It is hence that we had own team.

19:29.501 --> 19:30.968
When Ilegabas there

19:31.036 --> 19:33.402
you saw the destroyed airplanes,
that would not happen to us.

19:33.472 --> 19:35.872
The airplane landed, and it spent the night.

19:35.941 --> 19:37.203
You landed and they asked you:

19:37.276 --> 19:39.107
"? Do you want to stay or do you want a woman?

19:39.178 --> 19:40.736
"If you want my sister, you will have it.

19:40.812 --> 19:42.143
"? Do you want something of taking?".

19:42.214 --> 19:43.943
"Yes, I want to take and to return to the airplane

19:44.016 --> 19:46.814
"and to fly 12 hours drunkard. Clear.

19:46.885 --> 19:47.852
"The woman doesn't sound bad."

19:47.920 --> 19:49.319
The following thing was the load.

19:49.388 --> 19:50.753
There are two ways to return from there.

19:50.822 --> 19:51.948
Flying, one can return

19:52.024 --> 19:53.787
for the east of Cuba that is shorter,

19:53.859 --> 19:55.656
or one can return for the side west.

19:55.727 --> 19:57.718
If he/she had much combustible
the side west was the best

19:57.796 --> 20:00.697
because all Io that happened,

20:00.766 --> 20:01.994
he/she came from Bahamas.

20:02.067 --> 20:04.126
If they were patrolling,

20:04.203 --> 20:05.864
there it would be where they would be.

20:05.938 --> 20:07.803
One would go where the action is.

20:07.873 --> 20:11.206
So we came western,
nobody would think there of you.

20:11.376 --> 20:12.570
Apparently, the strict surveillance

20:12.644 --> 20:15.272
and bigger security
in the coast this of Florida,

20:15.347 --> 20:17.815
he/she makes that the smugglers
go to the coast west

20:17.883 --> 20:19.714
to make their connections.

20:19.785 --> 20:22.185
We appeared in the coast
on Marco Island,

20:22.254 --> 20:24.245
we flew to Georgia,

20:24.323 --> 20:25.847
we gave the turn and we returned.

20:25.924 --> 20:27.653
It seemed that we went toward the south.

20:27.726 --> 20:29.557
Nobody that came from north to south

20:29.628 --> 20:30.822
he/she made anything illegal.

20:30.896 --> 20:33.592
Ilevar 62.000 cadavers was been able to

20:33.665 --> 20:35.030
in an airplane in EE UU

20:35.100 --> 20:36.727
because I don't know how many airplanes

20:36.802 --> 20:38.269
there is at the same time in the air,

20:38.337 --> 20:39.531
but there is not control.

20:39.605 --> 20:41.232
You can land
in a small airport

20:41.306 --> 20:42.967
because there are not policemen in each airport

20:43.041 --> 20:44.338
that they ask what Ilevas in the airplane.

20:44.409 --> 20:45.842
We made as that we went

20:45.911 --> 20:47.310
to one of the local airports,

20:47.379 --> 20:51.042
but we made an approach
and we went to the west.

20:51.116 --> 20:54.142
We buy properties in Lakeland.

20:54.219 --> 20:55.982
We build two tracks

20:56.054 --> 20:58.079
and a couple of barns
that in fact they were hangars.

20:58.156 --> 20:59.623
They seemed barns.

20:59.691 --> 21:01.181
And when you opened the door of the hayloft

21:01.260 --> 21:04.752
you saw that it was adapted
to the line of an airplane.

21:04.830 --> 21:07.697
It managed a car
of about 8 years of antiquity...

21:07.766 --> 21:09.131
and we loaded him/her 300 packages.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.725
We put suspension to the car

21:10.802 --> 21:12.565
so that he/she didn't collapse

21:12.638 --> 21:15.129
and we used a crane to tow it.

21:15.207 --> 21:16.936
We had created
a company of tows

21:17.009 --> 21:19.569
and we buy a gas station
and a garage in Miami.

21:19.645 --> 21:21.772
The type of the crane
he/she had a work order.

21:21.847 --> 21:24.315
The driver, obviously,
Io that happened knew,

21:24.383 --> 21:25.577
but we told him/her: "If they stop you

21:25.651 --> 21:27.949
"and they open the cajuela, you don't know anything."

21:28.020 --> 21:29.783
If you manage the car it is difficult not to know

21:29.855 --> 21:31.880
Io that there is in the cajuela,
but that of the crane would not know.

21:31.957 --> 21:33.857
Not you know, they hired you to tow it.

21:33.925 --> 21:36.120
It hooked it and he/she left.

21:36.194 --> 21:37.752
He/she leaves that you Ileven the car,

21:37.829 --> 21:40.127
but they cannot stop
because you have the order.

21:40.198 --> 21:42.632
We went in caravan,
with two or three cars.

21:42.701 --> 21:43.998
One went to the front

21:44.069 --> 21:45.969
observing, and one went behind.

21:46.038 --> 21:49.166
They entered to Miami, and we made that

21:49.241 --> 21:52.733
during 7 years without having any problem.

21:52.811 --> 21:54.335
It was one of the advantages of Lakeland.

21:54.413 --> 21:56.142
They always stopped people

21:56.214 --> 21:57.875
that he/she went toward the north,

21:57.949 --> 22:01.441
but it was never known
that they stopped them if they went toward the south.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.818
Mickey and the other ones
they made air launchings.

22:03.889 --> 22:07.052
I built myself a small navy.

22:07.125 --> 22:10.185
We decide to make it of Colombia
to Bahamas

22:10.262 --> 22:12.196
and there to throw it to the boats.

22:12.264 --> 22:14.425
They threw buoys

22:14.499 --> 22:17.525
to know
with accuracy where the load was,

22:17.602 --> 22:18.967
because there was a frequency

22:19.037 --> 22:21.403
that it sent the sign with the location.

22:21.473 --> 22:25.102
The console of the mean opened up,

22:25.177 --> 22:27.304
they made holes in the mean of the boat

22:27.379 --> 22:29.313
and you Ilenaban.

22:29.381 --> 22:31.474
And it was brought inside the boats.

22:34.152 --> 22:37.053
The great problem
it was the packing of the product,

22:37.122 --> 22:39.590
that it was a fiasco
because the Colombians,

22:39.658 --> 22:41.717
so wonderful in the organization,

22:41.793 --> 22:43.055
Io ruined in two trips.

22:43.128 --> 22:45.187
There was filtration of salted water

22:45.263 --> 22:47.697
and that killed to the coca.

22:47.766 --> 22:49.996
The salted water is the enemy of the coca.

22:50.068 --> 22:52.866
Mickey was determined
in that could stop the filtration

22:52.938 --> 22:54.235
and he/she told them how to wrap them.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.501
I sent them recordings, I sent them pictures,

22:56.575 --> 22:58.372
step for step, of how to make it.

22:58.443 --> 23:00.343
One won't tell to a Colombian

23:00.412 --> 23:02.175
how anything to make.

23:02.247 --> 23:04.511
Mickey could pass it speaking

23:04.583 --> 23:06.676
that the Colombians
they won't make Io that tell them.

23:06.752 --> 23:08.310
My boys will look for the packages

23:08.387 --> 23:10.014
and when they returned

23:10.088 --> 23:13.057
they were not wrapped up.
They were as always.

23:13.125 --> 23:14.387
And Io tossed to the garbage,

23:14.459 --> 23:16.290
more than the half it didn't serve

23:16.361 --> 23:17.988
and they lost millions of dollars

23:18.063 --> 23:19.462
because they didn't know how to wrap it.

23:19.531 --> 23:21.931
For their stupidity, the water harmed.

23:22.000 --> 23:23.627
And they were bothered with me.

23:23.702 --> 23:25.465
But they could not accuse me,
it was their problem.

23:25.537 --> 23:28.062
"He/she hears, it is your problem."

23:28.140 --> 23:30.904
Not he/she went until the third trip
that he/she gave result.

23:30.976 --> 23:33.536
And it worked, and it worked.

23:33.612 --> 23:36.046
He/she sometimes entered for the front door.

23:36.114 --> 23:38.446
The front door
it was the entrance in Haulover.

23:38.517 --> 23:40.075
IlamÃ¡bamos this way.

23:40.152 --> 23:41.551
Not you said that Ilegabas for Haulover.

23:41.620 --> 23:43.019
So you said the front door.

23:43.088 --> 23:44.988
It is a code class.

23:45.056 --> 23:47.354
In Haulover Inlet rented a department

23:47.426 --> 23:48.893
in the floor 12 of the northeast corner

23:48.960 --> 23:50.222
Ilamada Harbour House,

23:50.295 --> 23:53.822
that he/she has a spectacular view
of the bay.

23:53.899 --> 23:57.562
I put to a youth,
I paid him/her so that he/she lived there,

23:57.636 --> 23:59.433
I paid for the department.

23:59.504 --> 24:00.994
When we took a trip

24:01.072 --> 24:02.767
she had a couple of binocular

24:02.841 --> 24:04.138
and clear, a radio.

24:04.209 --> 24:06.700
We find all
the possible frequencies

24:06.778 --> 24:08.507
against the competition.

24:08.580 --> 24:11.378
The Customs of EE UU,
the marine local patrol car.

24:11.450 --> 24:13.611
We would know if they were listening.

24:13.685 --> 24:16.119
Once I came home in boat.

24:16.188 --> 24:18.315
It was sometimes
with the boys in the front door

24:18.390 --> 24:19.755
or in the department.

24:19.825 --> 24:21.224
This time, it was in the boat

24:21.293 --> 24:23.318
speaking with my friends
in the department.

24:23.395 --> 24:25.590
Who Io will say,
people of Customs appeared

24:25.664 --> 24:28.155
and of the Coastal Watch
armed with rifles M16.

24:28.233 --> 24:31.464
Not I believe that they looked for us,
but they were revising boats.

24:31.536 --> 24:33.800
!And I am in a loaded boat!

24:33.872 --> 24:35.134
But when stopping to my side

24:35.207 --> 24:36.731
the motor of the boat ago:

24:36.808 --> 24:38.708
!bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!

24:38.777 --> 24:40.608
I tell him/her: "God, sounds awful."

24:40.679 --> 24:42.112
And he/she tells me: It has been this way" "for one day.

24:42.180 --> 24:43.511
!Oh, God!

24:43.582 --> 24:46.415
He/she gives the turn, he/she doesn't go away neither 30 meters

24:46.485 --> 24:48.077
and there is kind of a... !bum!

24:48.153 --> 24:50.621
I believed that it had shot the rifle

24:50.689 --> 24:53.123
and... it grabbed the wave exactly.

24:53.191 --> 24:54.852
The piston is shot of the motor

24:54.926 --> 24:57.622
and it jumps in the wave.
As if they threw a stone.

24:57.696 --> 24:59.459
A great Ilama comes out of side

24:59.531 --> 25:02.728
that it illuminates everything.
"!That I leave a ray!"

25:02.801 --> 25:05.031
They call for the radio but nobody responds.

25:05.103 --> 25:06.695
They had modern teams

25:06.771 --> 25:08.534
and I worried about them.

25:08.607 --> 25:09.733
"? Do they want that the tow?"

25:09.808 --> 25:13.505
I threw them a rope,
they were gone up to the boat

25:13.578 --> 25:15.603
and I towed the Coastal Watch

25:15.680 --> 25:17.477
and to the Customs of EE UU, but the boat

25:17.549 --> 25:20.313
he/she had loaded about 350, 400 kilos.

25:20.385 --> 25:21.613
The youth of the department

25:21.686 --> 25:23.210
he/she said that alone me...

25:23.288 --> 25:26.689
any other one had entered in panic
and jumped by the overboard.

25:26.758 --> 25:28.282
Of there we went until

25:28.360 --> 25:29.850
the entrance of the port of Maule Lake,

25:29.928 --> 25:31.657
where he/she had rented several quays.

25:31.730 --> 25:34.130
The following day Ilegaba my crane

25:34.199 --> 25:35.860
with a work order and a trÃ¡iler.

25:35.934 --> 25:37.765
My business was to four blocks.

25:37.836 --> 25:40.327
We put the boat there, we went from behind,

25:40.405 --> 25:44.136
we opened the compartment
and we loaded the cars.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.074
They gave the whole merchandise to me.

25:46.144 --> 25:48.374
He/she had several hiding places in Miami.

25:48.446 --> 25:50.073
It used common people,

25:50.148 --> 25:52.207
hard-working people that needed the money.

25:52.284 --> 25:55.378
It was about finding
to somebody in a decent neighborhood

25:55.453 --> 25:58.183
that it didn't consume drugs,

25:58.256 --> 26:00.952
because I made a couple of errors.

26:01.026 --> 26:03.586
He/she found holes in the kilos

26:03.662 --> 26:05.391
as if they put a jackstraw

26:05.463 --> 26:07.522
and it seemed that a rat was the culprit.

26:07.599 --> 26:09.897
Not it was in one, but in five different

26:09.968 --> 26:12.300
and it maybe lacked
one or two grams of each one.

26:12.370 --> 26:14.531
It parked in the garage

26:14.606 --> 26:16.005
to take out the product.

26:16.074 --> 26:17.939
Each house had a garage,

26:18.009 --> 26:20.204
because they were many kilos
entering and leaving

26:20.278 --> 26:22.246
and it could not discharge them in the street.

26:22.314 --> 26:25.181
It counted it, I made sure
that everything was.

26:25.250 --> 26:27.775
And Io made by day.
He/she never worked at night.

26:28.286 --> 26:29.913
Each product had a mark.

26:29.988 --> 26:31.922
300 had bicycles

26:31.990 --> 26:34.185
and 200 had glasses.

26:34.259 --> 26:36.386
Each one went to a certain group.

26:36.461 --> 26:39.225
He/she had three, four...
four different groups.

26:39.297 --> 26:40.855
They went with the cars

26:40.932 --> 26:42.263
to restoring Denny's, for example

26:42.334 --> 26:43.733
or to Uncle Tom's Ribs

26:43.802 --> 26:46.202
and the one that managed entered to the place

26:46.271 --> 26:48.967
and he/she gave him/her Ilaves
to the Colombian there inside.

26:49.040 --> 26:50.974
They were always Colombian.

26:51.042 --> 26:54.136
They had brought to their own one
people to sell it here.

26:54.212 --> 26:55.679
It never happened

26:55.747 --> 26:57.510
Io that showed the stupidity of < i > Mlaml Vlce < /i>

26:57.582 --> 26:59.948
where they stopped the cars
with weapons and everything.

27:00.018 --> 27:01.246
"Allow me to see Io that there is in the cajuela,

27:01.319 --> 27:03.651
"Io will revise, I will make tests
and you Io will return."

27:03.722 --> 27:05.189
Not it works this way.

27:05.256 --> 27:07.451
They were controlled by the other ones.

27:07.525 --> 27:08.822
Not it was that they had option,

27:08.893 --> 27:10.155
you same Ilevaban

27:10.228 --> 27:11.718
it was garbage or it was good,

27:11.796 --> 27:13.093
you Ilevaban.

27:13.164 --> 27:14.290
He/she gave them to him

27:14.366 --> 27:15.492
to wholesalers.

27:15.567 --> 27:17.364
The wholesalers Io divided

27:17.435 --> 27:20.632
in 25, 50, 75, Io that was...

27:20.705 --> 27:22.104
that their retailers wanted.

27:22.173 --> 27:24.334
I remember that the kilo cost 40.000,
50.000 dollars

27:24.409 --> 27:25.637
in the street for then.

27:25.710 --> 27:28.076
They paid us to transport the kilos.

27:28.146 --> 27:29.943
I believe that they paid us

27:30.015 --> 27:31.880
3500 dollars the kilo.

27:31.950 --> 27:34.441
To make sure
that they gave us the money

27:34.519 --> 27:36.043
alone we gave the half,

27:36.121 --> 27:37.554
and they put the money in the cajuela,

27:37.622 --> 27:39.317
and when they returned us the car

27:39.391 --> 27:42.519
he/she gave them the rest of the product.

27:42.594 --> 27:46.587
We are about maintaining
to all far from all

27:46.665 --> 27:48.428
and there was not this way way to rake him.

27:48.500 --> 27:50.627
One of my fears was that those
wholesalers,

27:50.702 --> 27:53.262
that you Io gave
to five different retailers,

27:53.338 --> 27:55.067
that they caught one

27:55.140 --> 27:57.631
and that for not wanting to go to the jail,
he/she began to sing,

27:57.709 --> 27:59.074
and he/she could tell them:

27:59.144 --> 28:00.873
"This is the main type,

28:00.945 --> 28:03.106
"follow it and he will bring them to me."

28:03.181 --> 28:06.014
Rafa counted that he/she had to kill to a type

28:06.084 --> 28:08.746
because Io caught and it will accuse them.

28:08.820 --> 28:10.720
I heard strange histories,

28:10.789 --> 28:14.247
so I tried

28:14.325 --> 28:15.553
of never to need help.

28:15.627 --> 28:16.889
To them they gave them the car,

28:16.961 --> 28:18.121
they didn't know from where he/she came,

28:18.196 --> 28:19.993
you already know, it is alone a car.

28:20.065 --> 28:22.260
You never returned the car

28:22.333 --> 28:24.130
where you had the coca, because you didn't want

28:24.202 --> 28:26.261
to have the money
and the drugs in the same place.

28:26.337 --> 28:28.931
The money stayed
in one of the hiding places.

28:29.007 --> 28:30.702
He/she participated my of the money

28:30.775 --> 28:32.003
and he/she kept the rest,

28:32.077 --> 28:33.908
because he/she had to send

28:33.978 --> 28:35.843
the money to Ochoa and Escobar.

28:36.381 --> 28:38.542
Then we worked
with Noriega in Panama.

28:42.287 --> 28:43.754
The country of General Noriega

28:43.822 --> 28:46.017
it is a meca for the laundry of money.

28:46.091 --> 28:47.854
We put the money in our airplane

28:47.926 --> 28:51.123
and we flew up to where it was
people of Noriega.

28:51.262 --> 28:54.254
It allowed them to use the airport
for the landings.

28:54.332 --> 28:55.731
We never sent an airplane

28:55.800 --> 28:57.097
with less than ten millions.

28:57.168 --> 28:58.897
Limitless quantities of money enter

28:58.970 --> 29:01.598
and they leave the country without any requirement.

29:01.673 --> 29:03.868
The laundry of money is not a crime.

29:03.942 --> 29:06.410
The army took the money,

29:06.478 --> 29:08.503
Io Ilevaban to the bank,

29:08.580 --> 29:10.377
and we were partners in the bank with Noriega.

29:10.448 --> 29:12.439
They opened the bills, you had a bill

29:12.517 --> 29:13.711
and for Io that you wanted

29:13.785 --> 29:14.911
you gave a check.

29:14.986 --> 29:17.079
Many times he/she made a treatment.

29:17.155 --> 29:18.622
Instead of paying me cash,

29:18.690 --> 29:20.157
of the 500 kilos

29:20.225 --> 29:21.954
they gave me 100 for me

29:22.026 --> 29:23.926
and he/she could sell it to 25.000 dollars.

29:23.995 --> 29:25.929
While Ilegaban the loads, it revised them

29:25.997 --> 29:26.986
and it took out the best,

29:27.065 --> 29:28.032
because they were not same,

29:28.099 --> 29:29.498
and it put them here and there.

29:29.567 --> 29:31.330
Max and I finish

29:31.402 --> 29:34.371
making about 750.000,
1.000.000 dollars for trip.

29:34.439 --> 29:36.134
Max told me that he used to make

29:36.207 --> 29:38.505
250.000 alone for the transport.

29:38.576 --> 29:40.100
ÃI was not only wet

29:40.178 --> 29:41.839
when it could have been been at home,

29:41.913 --> 29:43.107
but rather he/she was soaked

29:43.181 --> 29:45.274
and it won more three times per week.

29:45.817 --> 29:47.546
The drugs were in all sides.

29:47.619 --> 29:49.109
All consumed cocaine.

29:49.187 --> 29:52.554
I remember that was in the 80... !ugh!

29:52.624 --> 29:54.319
The cocaine was in fashion.

29:54.392 --> 29:55.984
It was something to show off.

29:56.060 --> 29:57.652
You went to any side...

29:57.729 --> 29:58.923
it could not leave to any side

29:58.997 --> 30:00.555
without entering to the bathroom and...

30:00.632 --> 30:02.224
When you entered to the bathroom, there was always

30:02.300 --> 30:03.528
somebody aspiring a line.

30:03.601 --> 30:05.364
You heard that he/she closed the door of the bathrooms

30:05.436 --> 30:06.698
and you heard them aspire.

30:06.771 --> 30:08.102
All entered something in the nose.

30:08.173 --> 30:09.140
You saw to types

30:09.207 --> 30:10.572
to leave the bathroom of the girls.

30:10.642 --> 30:12.405
There were places where the tables

30:12.477 --> 30:13.944
they were tapas of mirrors.

30:14.012 --> 30:17.573
The waiters helped
to the clients to mill the coca.

30:17.649 --> 30:20.516
In a time in Miami,
in the traffic accidents,

30:20.585 --> 30:22.485
that they were common accidents,

30:22.554 --> 30:24.784
3, 4 or 5 people sometimes left the car

30:24.856 --> 30:26.687
that they ran in all addresses.

30:26.758 --> 30:29.192
And they found cocaine
and you arm in the car.

30:29.260 --> 30:31.319
They stopped to a car and they found

30:31.396 --> 30:35.230
30 handbags Ilenos with more than 900 kilos

30:35.300 --> 30:37.461
of cocaine, with a purity of the 90 to 95%.

30:37.535 --> 30:40.504
While the hauls
and the seizures continue,

30:40.572 --> 30:43.973
there is more cocaine
in Florida of the South that never before.

30:44.042 --> 30:48.274
We were of having cases
of a kilo or two of cocaine

30:48.346 --> 30:51.782
to 1000 kilos that it is a ton,

30:51.850 --> 30:55.479
to 5000 kilos that are 10 tons.

30:55.553 --> 30:58.647
During a period of five years

30:58.723 --> 31:02.989
I presided over the trial of the case "the biggest
quantity of cocaine in the history"

31:03.061 --> 31:04.153
some ten times.

31:04.229 --> 31:06.925
Each case was bigger than the previous one

31:06.998 --> 31:08.431
and it imposed a new record.

31:08.499 --> 31:10.626
In general, when the prices lower

31:10.702 --> 31:12.169
it is a good news.

31:12.237 --> 31:16.435
The exception is the prices
of offer of the cocaine.

31:16.507 --> 31:17.633
They were millions of dollars in drugs

31:17.709 --> 31:19.074
that they fell of the sky.

31:19.143 --> 31:21.304
One day a shepherd was giving a sermon

31:21.379 --> 31:22.903
in a church of the south

31:22.981 --> 31:25.415
and he/she was speaking against the drugs

31:25.483 --> 31:26.609
and half million of dollars in cocaine

31:26.684 --> 31:28.151
they cross the roof

31:28.219 --> 31:29.652
because the airplane that Io was rushing

31:29.721 --> 31:31.052
it left course

31:31.122 --> 31:34.319
and it was pursued
for an airplane of the customs.

31:34.392 --> 31:36.223
The price of the white illegal powder

31:36.294 --> 31:40.355
he/she fell 50% in both
last years in Florida.

31:40.431 --> 31:42.399
!My God! There were people from Cali,

31:42.467 --> 31:44.458
another poster of Barranquilla.

31:44.535 --> 31:45.866
You began to multiply the cocaine

31:45.937 --> 31:47.029
that he/she entered to the country.

31:47.105 --> 31:48.367
The connection Miami-Colombia

31:48.439 --> 31:52.466
it is 80% of the 20.000 millions
annual of the business of the cocaine.

31:52.543 --> 31:54.602
Miami is one of the main branches

31:54.679 --> 31:57.443
of Io that Ilamamos Cocaine, S.To.

31:57.515 --> 32:00.143
Florida is flooded of cocaine.

32:03.888 --> 32:05.287
- It was in all sides.
- It was in all sides.

32:05.356 --> 32:07.119
- It was in all sides.
- Clubs, restaurants.

32:07.191 --> 32:08.283
It was in all sides.

32:08.359 --> 32:10.850
The elitist drug is now of labor class.

32:10.929 --> 32:15.832
People common worker
he/she believes that it is as the beer.

32:15.900 --> 32:19.893
One of each ten workers
it is drugged in the work.

32:19.971 --> 32:22.531
People Io Ilevaba in the neck,
non Io hid.

32:22.607 --> 32:24.006
Nobody was about hiding it.

32:24.075 --> 32:25.872
Undoubtedly I proved it, of course,

32:25.944 --> 32:27.172
but I could never understand

32:27.245 --> 32:28.769
what... why they liked.

32:28.846 --> 32:31.337
It is very intense, I cannot describe it.

32:31.416 --> 32:32.883
It is really well Io.

32:32.951 --> 32:34.248
People one went mad.

32:34.319 --> 32:36.480
Alone in Dade County,
the lethal overdoses

32:36.554 --> 32:40.081
they increased more than 88% in the last anus.

32:40.158 --> 32:42.752
He/she makes 15 years,
an annual death for cocaine

32:42.827 --> 32:44.954
it was not very common.
The deaths for cocaine

32:45.029 --> 32:47.293
they have increased at two per week.

32:47.365 --> 32:48.832
People began to smoke it.

32:48.900 --> 32:51.391
The studies indicate that most

32:51.469 --> 32:53.164
he/she has begun to smoke the drug.

32:53.237 --> 32:54.727
? Did you come to smoke cocaine?

32:54.806 --> 32:55.795
Yes.

32:55.873 --> 32:58.000
And not the crack, but in their basic form,

32:58.076 --> 32:59.771
because that IlegÃ³ before the crack.

32:59.844 --> 33:01.106
He/she transformed into furor.

33:01.179 --> 33:03.272
They locked in the houses and they smoked.

33:03.348 --> 33:06.579
I was awake four and a half days,

33:06.651 --> 33:09.484
without stopping, without to eat neither to sleep.

33:09.554 --> 33:12.318
Non Io understood, but he/she requested: "Make it."

33:12.390 --> 33:13.948
For me it was a business,

33:14.025 --> 33:17.153
and the more Io made,
more money won.

33:17.261 --> 33:21.061
I arrived here with about 800 dollars.

33:21.132 --> 33:22.190
It was Io that had to my name.

33:22.266 --> 33:25.429
He/she had about 25 or 26 years.

33:25.503 --> 33:27.596
When I began in the business

33:27.672 --> 33:30.197
it used the department
of my grandfather in South Beach.

33:30.274 --> 33:31.741
He/she had kilos there

33:31.809 --> 33:33.834
and I will never forget
the first time that he/she saw them.

33:33.911 --> 33:35.742
He/she said: ?" What is this?".
I counted him/her

33:35.813 --> 33:37.838
and he/she told me: "Not I can understand it."

33:37.915 --> 33:39.678
I responded: ?"You can understand

33:39.751 --> 33:41.616
"that I am winning 50.000 a week?".

33:41.686 --> 33:43.278
Once I told him/her:

33:43.354 --> 33:44.946
"I will no longer use your house.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.320
"I will pay to somebody."

33:46.391 --> 33:48.052
"? How? Not make that, non Io makes."

33:48.126 --> 33:50.253
And I told him/her:
"Not it cares, now I have a million."

33:50.328 --> 33:52.455
And he said: "Not you have a million dollars."

33:52.530 --> 33:54.157
"I have a million, I will pay to somebody

33:54.232 --> 33:55.699
"to put this in their house.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.359
"I no longer need to make you this to you."

33:57.435 --> 33:58.902
Then, a million for me

33:58.970 --> 33:59.937
it was a lot of money.

34:00.004 --> 34:01.631
It was the first million that won.

34:01.706 --> 34:04.834
It was a lot of money,
but after that...

34:06.110 --> 34:08.543
By the middle of the 70

34:08.612 --> 34:12.310
the American economy
it was in chaos state.

34:12.382 --> 34:14.373
The financial supplement of the < i > Mlaml Herald < /i>

34:14.452 --> 34:18.013
he/she spoke of a recession
national that was in march.

34:18.089 --> 34:21.456
There was a lot of unemployment,
people lost her houses,

34:21.525 --> 34:23.255
the real estate market
it was disappearing.

34:23.327 --> 34:26.194
The traffic of drugs
it is affecting the economy

34:26.264 --> 34:27.561
in Florida of the South.

34:27.632 --> 34:29.224
But in Miami
there were not houses to buy.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.824
They could not be gotten

34:30.902 --> 34:33.427
enough Rolex of gold
to supply to the market.

34:33.504 --> 34:37.634
In the first 6 months of 1977,
the sales retailers in Miami

34:37.708 --> 34:39.266
Ilegaron to the 10.000 millions.

34:39.342 --> 34:41.174
Not there are recession signs.

34:41.245 --> 34:42.940
Florida of the South stayed well

34:43.014 --> 34:44.708
that many other parts of the country.

34:44.782 --> 34:47.512
Here armored cars were sold

34:47.585 --> 34:48.882
for hundred of thousands of dollars.

34:48.953 --> 34:52.411
Ferraris neither Mercedes were not gotten.

34:52.489 --> 34:53.786
Certain agencies of automobiles

34:53.858 --> 34:56.918
they said that they have cars
enough it stops less than one month.

34:56.994 --> 34:58.985
They still admit in advance payments,

34:59.063 --> 35:00.997
although the deliveries will be delayed.

35:01.065 --> 35:04.523
All went to the business of the drugs.

35:05.069 --> 35:07.663
The drugs and the money
they go of the hand in Florida.

35:07.738 --> 35:10.866
It is a business retailer
of 7000 millions to the anus,

35:10.942 --> 35:15.402
that is near 12.000 dollars
for each house in Dade County.

35:15.480 --> 35:18.074
If it looks for in their wallet in Miami

35:18.149 --> 35:20.879
and it takes out a note and Io it analyzes

35:20.952 --> 35:22.579
he/she will find cocaine in him.

35:22.653 --> 35:24.382
The earnings of the gentlemen of the drug

35:24.455 --> 35:26.980
they made that the local economy
it resisted the recession.

35:27.058 --> 35:30.585
Every day, he/she spills money
in the economy of the coca.

35:30.661 --> 35:31.992
They buy houses,

35:32.063 --> 35:33.894
bounce, cars.

35:33.965 --> 35:35.227
He/she Had a Porsche I Upset,

35:35.299 --> 35:38.632
a Mercedes, then
the 6.9 were in fashion.

35:38.703 --> 35:40.000
We discuss once.

35:40.071 --> 35:41.698
We get angry. He/she requested me something

35:41.772 --> 35:42.898
and not you Io wanted to give.

35:42.974 --> 35:44.999
I came closer and Io slapped.

35:45.076 --> 35:46.407
It pursues me for the entrance

35:46.477 --> 35:48.707
and we grab two Mercedes
and we destroy them.

35:48.779 --> 35:51.680
Jon took out a he/she arms and it shot to the car

35:51.749 --> 35:53.580
to inclination... beside my head.

35:53.651 --> 35:55.642
!I made that somebody you Ilevara

35:55.720 --> 35:56.744
and it destroyed them!

35:56.821 --> 35:58.914
We demolished both vehicles.

35:58.990 --> 36:00.252
The following day I was laughing.

36:00.324 --> 36:01.848
We destroy many things.

36:01.926 --> 36:04.292
Skies, were cars
for value of 100.000 dollars.

36:04.362 --> 36:07.024
There was a company
that you Ilamaba I.P. Evans Mercedes.

36:07.098 --> 36:11.626
He/she had types like Max, Rafael,
two or three employees of Rafael,

36:11.702 --> 36:15.866
that they bought
about 8 or 10 Mercedes to the anus

36:15.940 --> 36:18.340
of Mercedes' concessionaire
with a check of Panama.

36:18.409 --> 36:20.434
? Who does buy 8 or 10 Mercedes to the anus?

36:20.511 --> 36:21.876
Then, they didn't care it.

36:21.946 --> 36:24.312
He/she entered and they told me:
"? How it is, Sr. Roberts?

36:24.382 --> 36:25.349
"? What does he/she need this week?".

36:25.416 --> 36:26.940
"I need the 6.9 of there."

36:27.018 --> 36:28.315
"Well?does he like it in black?"

36:28.386 --> 36:29.648
"Yes, he doesn't care the color.

36:29.720 --> 36:31.415
"And I need a van for their girlfriend."

36:31.489 --> 36:32.547
And he/she gave him/her a check.

36:32.623 --> 36:33.749
It was not even a box check.

36:33.824 --> 36:35.223
He/she knew to the type in the concessionaire,

36:35.293 --> 36:39.662
it was alone a check of a Panamanian bank

36:39.730 --> 36:41.493
and I list, he/she had the car.

36:41.566 --> 36:43.090
Very little it is made

36:43.167 --> 36:47.126
to stop the propagation
of the economy of the cocaine.

36:47.205 --> 36:48.797
All wanted money then.

36:48.873 --> 36:52.172
Not it is strange that a Latin
spend 20.000 dollars or more

36:52.243 --> 36:54.211
in all kinds of goods.

36:54.278 --> 36:57.441
The best thing for the merchant
it is that he/she pays him/her cash.

36:57.515 --> 37:00.416
Although the merchants in Florida
they don't consume drugs,

37:00.484 --> 37:03.510
it is said that they can
to be addicted to the money of the drug.

37:03.588 --> 37:05.317
We Buy a Cessna Conquest.

37:05.389 --> 37:08.085
We pay 980.000 dollars,

37:08.159 --> 37:11.219
cash? what do they count me?
Attempt it at some time.

37:11.295 --> 37:12.227
Neither they blinked.

37:12.296 --> 37:13.263
They believe to know

37:13.331 --> 37:14.593
from where the money comes,

37:14.665 --> 37:16.895
but they won't be desagradecidos.

37:16.968 --> 37:18.265
They never blinked.

37:18.336 --> 37:20.395
Not ask, don't speak,
he/she takes the money and veto.

37:20.471 --> 37:21.768
They didn't care a carajo.

37:21.839 --> 37:23.830
The sale of cocaine and marijuana in Miami

37:23.908 --> 37:25.569
it generates so much money

37:25.643 --> 37:28.669
that the smugglers
they don't have where to keep it.

37:28.746 --> 37:30.839
Not they understand, he/she had
bags of garbage in the garden

37:30.915 --> 37:33.679
with 700.000 dollars,
a million in each bag,

37:33.751 --> 37:35.082
buried. Not he/she had another place.

37:35.152 --> 37:37.416
ÃI used to keep it in the food of the horse.

37:37.488 --> 37:38.978
I remember to look for the food of the horse

37:39.056 --> 37:42.492
and to find money in the bag.

37:42.560 --> 37:44.585
Nobody questioned anything,

37:44.662 --> 37:45.890
because to my neighbor

37:45.963 --> 37:47.362
he/she gave 10 kilos a week.

37:47.431 --> 37:49.422
The neighborhood of Earth of the King

37:49.500 --> 37:51.024
it was a ruin when we move.

37:51.102 --> 37:52.330
To the neighbor of in front he/she gave him/her

37:52.403 --> 37:54.564
20 kilos a week,
this way what he took care.

37:54.639 --> 37:55.799
All wanted money

37:55.873 --> 37:57.773
and suddenly, all had money.

37:57.842 --> 38:00.208
The whole neighborhood.

38:00.278 --> 38:02.371
You wear out about 100.000 dollars of more

38:02.446 --> 38:05.415
and it is well. Jon was that good.

38:05.483 --> 38:07.144
Not it cared. Not it is that

38:07.218 --> 38:09.345
he/she didn't have enough money.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.752
? How could that be?

38:11.822 --> 38:13.449
? How could that be?

38:13.524 --> 38:15.685
He/she had three boats in the back patio,

38:15.760 --> 38:18.422
two pumas, two lionesses
living in my house.

38:18.496 --> 38:20.327
He/she had a helicopter in the back patio.

38:20.398 --> 38:22.491
He/she used to go in helicopter to the careers.

38:22.566 --> 38:23.965
All the other ones went in car.

38:24.035 --> 38:26.162
He/she landed to see run to my horses

38:26.237 --> 38:28.102
during one hour and he/she returned home.

38:28.172 --> 38:30.663
He/she had, 40, 50 horses in that time.

38:30.741 --> 38:32.902
Skies, he/she had excellent horses.

38:32.977 --> 38:35.138
? Io that costs know
to feed them one month?

38:35.212 --> 38:37.180
50.000 to the alone month to feed them.

38:37.248 --> 38:38.215
The cost didn't care

38:38.282 --> 38:39.977
because Io had in the pocket.

38:40.051 --> 38:41.018
People left party.

38:41.085 --> 38:42.780
Suddenly there were dozens

38:42.853 --> 38:45.151
of night clubs
of first that you/they were inaugurated.

38:45.222 --> 38:47.213
He/she already makes years that didn't open up
a night club

38:47.291 --> 38:48.724
in Miami Beach.

38:48.793 --> 38:50.488
The Jockey Club, Turnberry,

38:50.561 --> 38:52.085
Palm Bay Club, Cricket Club.

38:52.163 --> 38:54.188
But the best of all was

38:54.265 --> 38:56.426
The Mutiny, in Coconut Grove.

38:56.500 --> 39:00.334
It was exclusively for the traffickers.

39:00.404 --> 39:02.099
If you were in that business, you had the money.

39:02.173 --> 39:04.664
You could entertain
to people abundantly.

39:04.742 --> 39:06.505
We used to go to the restaurants...

39:06.577 --> 39:08.602
to have dinner to Arturo's or Palm

39:08.679 --> 39:09.941
or to Joe's Stone Crab.

39:10.014 --> 39:12.278
The Forge
it was then the best restaurant.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.942
They gave us the fourth bottom in The Forge

39:14.018 --> 39:16.077
and we closed the room.

39:16.153 --> 39:18.883
And we could spend
20.000 dollars in one night

39:18.956 --> 39:20.253
and to destroy the walls.

39:20.324 --> 39:22.258
We gave them the money
so that Io that we broke fixed.

39:22.326 --> 39:25.762
It was an I waste, the money was not anything.

39:25.830 --> 39:27.991
Jon liked to go
to the bars of nudes.

39:28.065 --> 39:31.262
Not it was anything to spend 5000 dollars
in a striptease club.

39:31.335 --> 39:33.735
Not we speak of one night,

39:33.804 --> 39:35.465
but of three or four a week.

39:35.539 --> 39:36.972
He/she told to my friends:
"? Do you see that girl?

39:37.041 --> 39:40.306
"I guarantee you that I can
to make that he/she goes to bed with you."

39:40.378 --> 39:41.777
ÃI said: "Not there is way

39:41.846 --> 39:43.370
"that he/she wants to go to bed with me."

39:43.447 --> 39:44.778
He/she asked him/her: ?" How much you want

39:44.849 --> 39:47.113
"to go to bed with this type?".
"Non Io will make."

39:47.184 --> 39:48.981
"?Will non Io make? I give you 500."

39:49.053 --> 39:50.281
"Non Io will make."
"I give you 1000."

39:50.354 --> 39:51.787
"?Will non Io make? I give you 2000."

39:51.856 --> 39:54.290
At the end, they stopped to resist.

39:54.358 --> 39:55.723
2000, 3000 dollars. "I will make it."

39:55.793 --> 39:58.660
And the type started to tremble,

39:58.729 --> 40:00.924
they could not understand how Io achieved.

40:01.365 --> 40:03.492
Although Miami has changed, I still believe

40:03.567 --> 40:05.694
that all had a price.
All Io has.

40:05.770 --> 40:07.237
They are few those that not.

40:07.304 --> 40:09.499
You could begin with Noriega in Panama

40:09.573 --> 40:10.699
and to lower until

40:10.775 --> 40:13.266
the administrators of the city,
to the police.

40:13.344 --> 40:14.675
If they stopped somebody

40:14.745 --> 40:17.213
and they had 50 kilos, they were offered a tip.

40:17.281 --> 40:20.011
One maybe is not able to
coimear to a policeman with 20 dollars

40:20.084 --> 40:22.917
or with 50 or 100, but there were hundred

40:22.987 --> 40:23.976
of thousands of dollars.

40:24.054 --> 40:25.612
Tell them that in one hour you will have

40:25.689 --> 40:27.520
Io that they want cash.

40:27.591 --> 40:28.649
Half million,

40:28.726 --> 40:30.455
three million rooms.

40:30.528 --> 40:31.688
But you should leave with the coca.

40:31.762 --> 40:33.127
He/she almost always gave result.

40:33.197 --> 40:34.459
He/she knew a lieutenant

40:34.532 --> 40:35.897
that Bay worked in North Village.

40:35.966 --> 40:36.933
I came closer one day and I told him/her:

40:37.001 --> 40:38.628
"I want to discharge some boats

40:38.702 --> 40:40.636
"behind police's department

40:40.704 --> 40:42.262
"?do you believe that there will be problems?".

40:42.339 --> 40:44.500
And he/she said: He/she "looks, we will use two patrol.

40:44.575 --> 40:45.735
"Put it in the cajuelas

40:45.810 --> 40:47.175
"and Ilevaremos to where you want."

40:47.244 --> 40:49.542
We accuse four mayors

40:49.613 --> 40:53.674
most sentenced by corruption.

40:53.751 --> 40:56.242
We were very powerful
and we had a lot of money.

40:56.320 --> 40:57.617
?There are places where they have more power

40:57.688 --> 41:00.054
- that the government?
- Hey... Unfortunately,

41:00.124 --> 41:01.591
I believe that it is certain.

41:01.659 --> 41:04.127
I was member of the republican circle.

41:04.195 --> 41:06.060
Howard Baker sent me a letter:

41:06.130 --> 41:08.530
"Send me the contribution
and you can come to Washington."

41:08.599 --> 41:11.591
AIlÃ­ was, with the senators
and the fat fish

41:11.669 --> 41:13.102
and neither one of them asked me

41:13.170 --> 41:15.661
neither to what I was devoted in Miami.

41:15.739 --> 41:17.036
They accepted me

41:17.107 --> 41:18.540
because I made a great contribution

41:18.609 --> 41:19.974
to the Republican party.

41:20.044 --> 41:22.376
It was in that circle and I told myself:

41:22.446 --> 41:24.209
"I made all this with the drugs

41:24.281 --> 41:26.511
"and Io made with alone that."

41:26.584 --> 41:29.382
The traffic of cocaine and the money

41:29.453 --> 41:33.981
almost they ruin the morality
of this community.

41:34.058 --> 41:35.685
Millions of dollars cash

41:35.759 --> 41:38.250
they support to a net of banks of drugs.

41:38.329 --> 41:40.126
?Have you done a city with so many banks?

41:40.197 --> 41:41.562
?You will tell me that that class exists

41:41.632 --> 41:43.293
of industry and businesses here?

41:43.367 --> 41:44.994
Please.

41:45.069 --> 41:46.900
That makes the government suspect

41:46.971 --> 41:49.166
it is that the last anus
the banks of Florida of the South

41:49.240 --> 41:54.007
you Ilevaron 6000 million dollars extra
of the savers.

41:54.078 --> 41:58.276
The presidents of the banks
they counted money during days.

41:58.349 --> 42:00.283
?Is Landmark a bank of the coca?

42:00.351 --> 42:02.080
Definitively not.

42:02.152 --> 42:05.713
The banks invested
in machines accountants of money.

42:05.789 --> 42:08.053
For lack of space,
the banks Io surrendered

42:08.125 --> 42:09.615
to the Federal Reserve.

42:09.693 --> 42:11.888
A bank of this size deposits

42:11.962 --> 42:15.523
near 12 million dollars to the anus
in the Federal Reserve.

42:15.599 --> 42:17.658
The last anus, the Continental-National

42:17.735 --> 42:20.670
it deposited 600 million dollars
cash.

42:20.738 --> 42:21.864
? He/she means

42:21.939 --> 42:23.406
that this bank is not legal?

42:23.474 --> 42:24.441
Here the money is counted

42:24.508 --> 42:26.567
of the Federal Reserve in Miami.

42:26.644 --> 42:28.771
The last anus, the Federal Reserve of here

42:28.846 --> 42:32.714
it generated a surplus of effective
of 5000 millions,

42:32.783 --> 42:35.217
more money than all
the other banks of Federal Reserve

42:35.286 --> 42:36.947
of the whole country.

42:37.254 --> 42:38.778
To Miami it can describe it

42:38.856 --> 42:40.881
as the general barracks of the exterior

42:40.958 --> 42:42.926
for the laundry of money
of the Colombians.

42:42.993 --> 42:44.927
I bought properties for all sides.

42:44.995 --> 42:46.428
There are thousands of properties

42:46.497 --> 42:48.021
that they are worth more than 1000 million dollars

42:48.098 --> 42:51.192
that they were bought with illegal money
in Florida of the South.

42:51.268 --> 42:52.257
A couple of houses.

42:52.336 --> 42:53.530
A navy.

42:53.604 --> 42:55.003
The property where my business was.

42:55.072 --> 42:56.039
We buy departments.

42:56.106 --> 42:57.164
Many deposits.

42:57.241 --> 43:00.039
We buy 190 hectares
of earth in Tampa.

43:00.110 --> 43:01.441
A real estate great business.

43:01.512 --> 43:02.706
We buy one of the buildings

43:02.780 --> 43:04.077
to transform it into a radio room.

43:04.148 --> 43:06.378
Four hundred hectares in Central Florida.

43:06.450 --> 43:09.715
The traffickers bought 8, 10, 15 houses.

43:09.787 --> 43:10.913
In a place in the south of Miami,

43:10.988 --> 43:12.979
he/she was owner of almost the whole neighborhood.

43:13.057 --> 43:17.221
He/she had 24 million dollars
in properties.

43:17.294 --> 43:21.594
One day I will work
and I enter to the Interstate one 95,

43:21.665 --> 43:26.796
the one that gives me a beautiful view
of the center of Miami.

43:26.870 --> 43:28.770
"He/she looks at that", and we count

43:28.839 --> 43:34.038
22 cranes for the construction

43:34.111 --> 43:36.705
that they were seen in the horizon.

43:36.780 --> 43:39.977
"I wonder how much
of that money it is of the drugs."

43:40.050 --> 43:43.577
!Skies! ? How much did I spend?

43:43.654 --> 43:48.990
There was so much money that once he/she entered

43:49.059 --> 43:50.549
you could no longer destroy.

43:54.031 --> 43:55.430
Maybe Io that I kept in the bank...

43:55.499 --> 43:58.491
at least 50 million dollars.

43:58.569 --> 44:00.537
Thousands of millions will have financed

44:00.604 --> 44:04.199
much of the development
and of the construction in Miami.

44:04.274 --> 44:06.242
But it was spotted money of blood.

44:10.314 --> 44:14.410
I center commercial Dadeland
July 11 1979 - 14.28 hours

44:14.485 --> 44:15.952
1979 were the anus

44:16.020 --> 44:19.421
in that the things became serious.

44:19.490 --> 44:22.152
Dadeland was the moment definitorio.

44:22.226 --> 44:24.490
The first shooting in the war of the cocaine.

44:24.561 --> 44:26.893
The shooting happened at 14.30 o'clock

44:26.964 --> 44:29.694
when two Latins entered to a liquor store

44:29.767 --> 44:31.701
in the side west of the commercial center.

44:31.769 --> 44:34.499
Two or three Latins followed them more

44:34.571 --> 44:36.163
and there the shooting began.

44:36.240 --> 44:38.071
We knew immediately

44:38.142 --> 44:41.441
that it was another shooting
among Colombian for drug.

44:41.512 --> 44:43.571
Two people have died

44:43.647 --> 44:45.672
and others are wounded.

44:45.749 --> 44:48.411
Inside the liquor store, a Colombian

44:48.485 --> 44:51.750
and another no-Cuban Latin
suspects of traffic of drugs

44:51.822 --> 44:54.450
they lie in a puddle of blood.

44:54.525 --> 44:56.390
I was running until there and I said:

44:56.460 --> 44:58.621
"I am of the < i > Mlaml Herald, < /i>
?do Io that happened here know?".

44:58.696 --> 45:01.358
The policemen were in shock state.

45:01.432 --> 45:04.026
Never in my life I saw...

45:04.101 --> 45:06.365
hey... such a quantity of...

45:06.437 --> 45:10.032
hey... ?how to say it?

45:10.107 --> 45:12.837
In 1979, I spent two years in homicide.

45:12.910 --> 45:15.242
But this went further on

45:15.312 --> 45:17.872
of Io that anyone
it could have imagined.

45:17.948 --> 45:20.940
There were glasses and wastes for all sides.

45:21.018 --> 45:25.079
There were bullet cases
in the wall, the floor,

45:25.155 --> 45:28.386
in the shelf, it seemed
a shooting of the old west.

45:28.459 --> 45:29.756
The aggressor shot

45:29.827 --> 45:31.124
for the whole parking lot.

45:31.195 --> 45:32.162
? Io that happened them saw

45:32.229 --> 45:33.196
when it finished the shooting?

45:33.263 --> 45:35.356
- They left running.
- ?Where?

45:35.432 --> 45:37.229
Not I know, I was running.

45:37.301 --> 45:39.326
The innocent pedestrians
they looked for refuge,

45:39.403 --> 45:41.268
the cars were riddled
with metralletas,

45:41.338 --> 45:42.635
the tanks of gasoline
they spilled their content.

45:42.706 --> 45:44.833
There were two scenes, the main scene

45:44.908 --> 45:47.206
where they were
the bodies, in the liquor store,

45:47.277 --> 45:49.245
and the secondary scene,
to the one that you/they assigned me

45:49.313 --> 45:51.508
it is the one that you IlamÃ³
the van of war.

45:53.183 --> 45:55.481
They found a van

45:55.552 --> 45:56.849
to the north of the commercial center.

45:56.920 --> 45:58.581
With the open door and the lit motor.

45:58.655 --> 46:01.385
It was a van Ford Econoline 1979

46:01.458 --> 46:03.085
transformed into armed people's transport.

46:03.160 --> 46:04.422
It was the machine of the death.

46:04.495 --> 46:06.861
He/she had steel reinforced to the sides.

46:06.930 --> 46:09.160
The windows were taken out
to be able to shoot.

46:09.233 --> 46:12.066
He/she Said Happy "Supplying Hour"
in the side.

46:12.136 --> 46:14.070
We find 14 different weapons.

46:14.138 --> 46:16.800
These murderers
they were as the glasses descartables

46:16.874 --> 46:18.273
clever to discard.

46:18.342 --> 46:20.776
They shot a he/she arms
until it was empty,

46:20.844 --> 46:22.402
they threw it and they took another.

46:22.479 --> 46:26.245
There was of everything, shotguns,
carbines, MAC-10, an Uzi,

46:26.316 --> 46:28.910
several guns, ammunition for all.

46:28.986 --> 46:32.820
I believe that the van of the war
it was the decisive moment

46:32.890 --> 46:36.951
where the police
he/she realized to Io that faced

46:37.027 --> 46:38.221
and how overcome they were.

46:38.295 --> 46:40.126
? What he/she tells him/her the quantity of armament

46:40.197 --> 46:41.630
in that van?

46:41.698 --> 46:43.825
Well... that they are very armed

46:43.901 --> 46:47.667
and that... they are prepared to give battle.

46:47.738 --> 46:49.228
The bullets flew for all sides.

46:49.306 --> 46:51.206
The total bill was of 86 bullets

46:51.275 --> 46:52.742
that they were shot of all the weapons.

46:52.810 --> 46:54.437
Skies, I don't know...

46:54.511 --> 46:56.001
I don't know how many times they shot them.

46:56.079 --> 46:58.172
They had so many bullet wounds

46:58.248 --> 47:00.443
that it was me impossible

47:00.517 --> 47:03.281
to determine the exact number of shots.

47:03.353 --> 47:05.048
We made the pursuit standard,

47:05.122 --> 47:07.090
the van
it was registered with a false name.

47:07.157 --> 47:09.489
The weapons bought them
with false names.

47:09.560 --> 47:11.118
We went to the addresses

47:11.195 --> 47:12.355
but they had already escaped.

47:12.429 --> 47:13.555
It was the Colombian typical case.

47:13.630 --> 47:14.756
Not us IlevÃ³ to any side.

47:14.832 --> 47:16.527
The police registered the neighborhood

47:16.600 --> 47:19.160
during more than one hour,
but they didn't find suspicious.

47:19.236 --> 47:20.794
I told myself: "Another open" slope.

47:20.871 --> 47:23.431
That means a case without solving

47:23.507 --> 47:27.307
because so far
we have not been successful

47:27.377 --> 47:28.639
in closing the Colombian murder.

47:28.712 --> 47:30.703
We have a new phenomenon,

47:30.781 --> 47:32.806
this violence doesn't have precedent.

47:32.883 --> 47:34.817
The sophistication didn't have precedent.

47:36.987 --> 47:39.217
I believe that it was the first case

47:39.289 --> 47:40.756
where there was a shooting

47:40.824 --> 47:43.292
in a public place in the mean of the day

47:43.360 --> 47:45.021
when people happened over there.

47:45.095 --> 47:47.723
After that, it frequently happened.

47:47.798 --> 47:50.790
It was the principle of a war,
the war of the cocaine.

47:50.868 --> 47:52.233
The detectives of homicides

47:52.302 --> 47:54.793
they say that Miami is
in the mean of a war

47:54.905 --> 47:57.271
among drug traffickers
Colombian and Cuban.

47:57.341 --> 47:58.399
Miami was changing.

47:58.475 --> 48:00.636
The Colombians
they were tossing to the Cubans.

48:00.711 --> 48:03.646
There was a lot of noise
to share the market.

48:03.714 --> 48:05.272
One of the reasons of the violence

48:05.349 --> 48:07.579
it was due to the competitive factions.

48:07.651 --> 48:13.112
And the violence converted Miami
in the Horsemen of the Cocaine.

48:13.190 --> 48:14.487
This Way Ilaman, the Horsemen of the Cocaine.

48:14.558 --> 48:16.458
Ilaman the Horsemen of the Cocaine.

48:16.526 --> 48:21.020
This of the Horsemen of the Cocaine,
they were people from MedellÃ­n.

48:21.098 --> 48:23.396
The calculations say that they are 100.000

48:23.467 --> 48:24.729
the Colombian illegal residents

48:24.801 --> 48:27.793
that they live and they work
for the traffic of drugs in Florida.

48:27.871 --> 48:29.702
They went after their objective,

48:29.773 --> 48:31.570
they killed the wife, to the maid.

48:31.642 --> 48:32.904
"If there is a dog there, Io will kill."

48:32.976 --> 48:34.341
"If there is a bird, Io I will kill,

48:34.411 --> 48:35.673
"if there is a pececito, Io I will kill."

48:35.746 --> 48:38.374
If a girl Ilamaba
to the door to sell cookies,

48:38.448 --> 48:39.972
they also killed her.

48:40.050 --> 48:41.950
Stopped people there, children.

48:42.019 --> 48:43.646
They killed anyone.

48:43.720 --> 48:45.813
They killed visible anyone.

48:45.889 --> 48:48.050
JesÃºs HernÃ¡ndez,
a machine gun discharge

48:48.125 --> 48:49.592
Io destroyed in its car

48:49.660 --> 48:51.594
in a street converged at noon.

48:51.662 --> 48:52.788
Machine gun fire.

48:54.264 --> 48:55.162
And then I heard the one...

48:57.801 --> 49:00.133
An Iluvia of bullets IlenÃ³ the department,

49:00.203 --> 49:03.900
a sign of identity
of the Horsemen of the Cocaine.

49:03.974 --> 49:06.442
In the freeways, the tolls, the national one 1,

49:06.510 --> 49:08.341
in some residential streets.

49:08.412 --> 49:10.073
Red Mustang went toward to the north

49:10.147 --> 49:12.047
in the avenue 107.

49:12.115 --> 49:15.676
The green sedan stopped
beside the driver and he/she opened fire.

49:15.752 --> 49:18.915
The tools of the death,
you arm automatic and shotguns.

49:18.989 --> 49:21.014
This is Io that you leave in television,

49:21.091 --> 49:22.649
that doesn't leave in the real life.

49:22.726 --> 49:25.126
The witnesses said
that it was a war zone.

49:25.195 --> 49:26.992
To the style < i > Mlaml Vlce, < /i > but without the cameras.

49:27.064 --> 49:29.794
But this was the real life,
it was happening.

49:29.866 --> 49:31.163
They killed over there at five,

49:31.234 --> 49:32.701
three over there.

49:32.769 --> 49:34.862
A calm area of Kendall

49:34.938 --> 49:37.168
it was the scenario of a slaughter.

49:37.240 --> 49:39.708
They were six bodies
in an elegant house.

49:39.776 --> 49:41.471
The police says that it is the worst

49:41.545 --> 49:43.945
case of multiple murder
in the history of the city.

49:44.014 --> 49:46.448
It is believed that the massacre
it is related with the drugs.

49:46.516 --> 49:51.044
We speak of slaughters that in this time

49:51.121 --> 49:53.715
they would have journalistic covering

49:53.790 --> 49:55.815
of all the television channels.

49:55.892 --> 49:59.384
That level of violence was to newspaper

49:59.463 --> 50:03.331
and the local means,
because we were saturated of it,

50:03.400 --> 50:05.527
they said: "Ah, another double" homicide.

50:05.602 --> 50:07.194
"Ah, another triple homicide."

50:07.270 --> 50:09.067
It was common that we were

50:09.139 --> 50:11.130
jumping of a scene from the crime to another.

50:11.208 --> 50:12.766
He/she had to have more than four deads

50:12.843 --> 50:14.435
so that it was important.

50:14.511 --> 50:18.447
I remember five murders
that they happened one night.

50:18.515 --> 50:21.951
They happened eight murders
in Dade in the last 48 hours.

50:22.019 --> 50:23.213
You never knew when you will trip

50:23.286 --> 50:24.253
with another body.

50:24.321 --> 50:25.788
Miami looked like each other

50:25.856 --> 50:29.849
to the slaughter of San Valentine's Day
of the 20s in Chicago.

50:29.926 --> 50:32.622
GÃ¡nsteres managing for the streets

50:32.696 --> 50:34.561
stopped of side

50:34.631 --> 50:37.395
with their machine guns Thompson.45

50:37.467 --> 50:40.630
tiroteÃ¡ndose in Chicago in the 30s.

50:40.704 --> 50:42.672
What happens here

50:42.739 --> 50:45.367
he/she would make that Chicago,
in the days of the dry law

50:45.442 --> 50:47.774
it seemed a picnic
of a Sunday school.

50:47.844 --> 50:50.677
One of the policemen said
that he/she resembled Dodge City.

50:50.747 --> 50:52.806
It seemed the Distant West then in that.

50:52.883 --> 50:55.078
But he/she made a mistake, because Dodge City

50:55.152 --> 50:57.313
it was never as violent as Io it was Miami.

50:57.387 --> 51:00.720
Miami in the 80s were considered

51:00.791 --> 51:03.692
the most dangerous place in the earth.

51:03.760 --> 51:06.752
The city of the murder was Detroit,
then Atlanta, and now Miami.

51:06.830 --> 51:10.061
In 1976, 104 murders were investigated.

51:10.133 --> 51:12.101
The first seven months of 1979

51:12.169 --> 51:14.831
they were the bloodiest
in the history of Florida of the South.

51:14.905 --> 51:18.397
There were 573 homicides in 1980.

51:18.475 --> 51:21.137
1981 will break another record

51:21.211 --> 51:22.974
of murders in Miami.

51:23.046 --> 51:25.514
I believe that there will be more than 600 murders

51:25.582 --> 51:26.947
for anus ends.

51:27.017 --> 51:29.417
While the traffic of drugs prospers,

51:29.486 --> 51:32.546
the average of homicides
in Dade it will continue ascending.

51:32.622 --> 51:34.920
The crime in Miami ascended and the tourism lowered.

51:34.991 --> 51:38.017
In spite of the pessimism
that people predict,

51:38.095 --> 51:39.926
we predict that we will have

51:39.996 --> 51:42.328
more arrivals of tourists
in the area of Miami

51:42.399 --> 51:44.299
for the summer
of Io that we had the passed anus,

51:44.367 --> 51:45.356
that it was an exceptional anus.

51:48.705 --> 51:51.071
For Fidel Castro it was the equivalent one

51:51.141 --> 51:52.768
to a genocide act.

51:52.843 --> 51:54.606
Of a single time, it liberated Cuba

51:54.678 --> 51:57.044
of thousands and thousands of undesirable.

51:57.114 --> 51:59.082
It emptied the jails, it tossed to the vagrants

51:59.149 --> 52:02.243
of the streets of Havana.
Murderers, thieves, perverts,

52:02.319 --> 52:04.981
prostitutes, slowed, discapacitados,

52:05.055 --> 52:07.990
all joined
and they were sent Mariel Harbor

52:08.058 --> 52:10.288
and of there in boats in address to Miami.

52:10.360 --> 52:12.828
Fidel Castro declared openly:

52:12.896 --> 52:15.558
"I threw of the chain of the bathrooms
of Cuba on EE UU."

52:15.632 --> 52:16.860
And he/she bounced of it.

52:16.933 --> 52:20.630
A ship came out toward EE UU
every 5 minutes,

52:20.704 --> 52:23.104
Ilegaban without nuisances day and night.

52:24.975 --> 52:27.273
It was something common in Florida of the South.

52:27.344 --> 52:29.141
Shootings, dead people

52:29.212 --> 52:31.407
and most of the time, the murderers

52:31.481 --> 52:34.416
they are those that came from Cuba in 1980.

52:34.484 --> 52:36.475
As consequence, the rate
of murders it was duplicated.

52:36.553 --> 52:38.953
It was as if there is
correspondent an army invader

52:39.022 --> 52:41.957
so that it violated, he/she stole
and it set on fire the city.

52:42.025 --> 52:44.084
And it is Io that are making.

52:44.161 --> 52:47.562
I assault serious, violations, robberies.

52:47.631 --> 52:50.156
In little time,
we had bodies in the floor.

52:50.233 --> 52:53.293
We had to heap them.
It was a shame.

52:53.370 --> 52:54.667
There have been so many murders

52:54.738 --> 52:56.137
in Miami lately

52:56.206 --> 52:58.572
that a refrigerated truck is in use

52:58.642 --> 53:00.610
for the office of the forensic surgeon of Dade

53:00.677 --> 53:02.474
to keep the bodies.

53:02.546 --> 53:04.309
They had fixed to rent it

53:04.381 --> 53:07.680
to Burger King,
that he/she has the central office here.

53:07.751 --> 53:09.082
It was very angry.

53:09.152 --> 53:11.916
The martian have invaded us.

53:11.988 --> 53:13.922
These types are unhinged.

53:13.990 --> 53:16.458
To anybody it seemed to care him/her Io that happened

53:16.526 --> 53:18.460
in the streets of Miami. For that reason I spoke.

53:18.528 --> 53:21.793
Psychologically,
they are not even human.

53:21.865 --> 53:23.230
They are animal... not even animals,

53:23.300 --> 53:24.927
that it is an insult to the animal Kingdom.

53:25.001 --> 53:27.231
Not there were law neither order.

53:27.304 --> 53:29.204
We all carry weapons. My wife,

53:29.272 --> 53:31.103
my two children.

53:31.174 --> 53:33.233
They will see that I have a loaded shotgun

53:33.361 --> 53:35.261
And we will shoot somebody.

53:35.329 --> 53:36.318
I never traveled

53:36.397 --> 53:38.058
for the county of Dade without being armed.

53:38.132 --> 53:39.963
Not there is doubt on it.

53:40.034 --> 53:43.993
I always had a he/she arms,
he/she didn't sleep well without her

53:44.071 --> 53:45.561
especially in Miami of that time.

53:45.640 --> 53:47.540
Edna Buchanan said in television

53:47.608 --> 53:48.870
that it carries two weapons

53:48.943 --> 53:50.205
and that all should make it.

53:50.278 --> 53:52.576
Merret Steirheim,
then administrator of the county,

53:52.647 --> 53:54.012
and the commissaries were furious,

53:54.081 --> 53:55.912
so I was person it doesn't burnish for a while.

53:55.983 --> 53:58.577
Miami was literally
being come below.

53:58.653 --> 54:00.348
But the police help non IlegarÃ­a

54:00.421 --> 54:02.719
due to lack
of personal in the department.

54:02.923 --> 54:05.414
The federal agencies
they admit to be paralyzed

54:05.493 --> 54:08.189
for the lack of men, money and resources.

54:08.262 --> 54:10.287
The department of police of Miami

54:10.364 --> 54:14.357
it left frantically to look for personal.

54:14.435 --> 54:16.335
More policemen in the street

54:16.404 --> 54:18.804
they will help to revert this tendency.

54:18.873 --> 54:20.204
They used to have parameters.

54:20.274 --> 54:21.764
Not to never have consumed drug

54:21.842 --> 54:23.207
to be police.

54:23.277 --> 54:24.369
They reduced it

54:24.445 --> 54:26.413
to in the last 10 years

54:26.480 --> 54:27.879
and that didn't work.

54:27.948 --> 54:29.745
"In the last five years."

54:29.817 --> 54:31.409
They didn't reach even this way.

54:31.485 --> 54:33.851
Lastly, Io reduced
to the last two years.

54:33.921 --> 54:35.479
And Ilegaron to a point

54:35.556 --> 54:37.888
in that hired them
if they didn't consume in that moment.

54:37.958 --> 54:41.917
That was
in the biggest crisis of police corruption

54:41.996 --> 54:44.760
from the days of Serpico in New York.

54:44.832 --> 54:47.630
The whole class of the academy of that anus

54:47.702 --> 54:49.602
it finished in prison or dead.

54:49.670 --> 54:51.763
They are already three the officials

54:51.839 --> 54:53.101
that they arrested this weekend.

54:53.174 --> 54:55.335
Today's arrests was given
while other seven

54:55.409 --> 54:58.640
they are in accused trial
of stealing to the drug dealers

54:58.713 --> 55:00.442
and of selling the drugs themselves.

55:00.514 --> 55:03.608
The Policemen of the Cocaine
they have been accused of conspiracy,

55:03.684 --> 55:05.515
traffic of drugs and organized crime.

55:05.586 --> 55:09.579
The result, impacting...
40 policemen and former policemen

55:09.657 --> 55:12.057
arrested or suspended
in the last two years.

55:12.126 --> 55:14.890
Sixteen suspended
in the last two weeks.

55:14.962 --> 55:16.224
And that is not everything.

55:16.297 --> 55:18.959
At least 30 more policemen
they will be suspended.

55:19.033 --> 55:23.402
The hand of the law failed in Florida of the South.

55:23.471 --> 55:24.961
Then stop to work

55:25.039 --> 55:26.370
and let us abandon the streets.

55:26.440 --> 55:28.840
We are committed
seriously and we will recapture

55:28.909 --> 55:30.274
the control of the streets another time.

55:30.344 --> 55:33.074
The system of justice doesn't work here.

55:33.147 --> 55:36.742
I suggest that we revise the whole concept.

55:36.817 --> 55:40.776
CENTAC 26 entered in operations
in December of the 81.

55:40.855 --> 55:43.415
There were 25 organizations previous CENTAC

55:43.491 --> 55:44.958
in all EE UU.

55:45.025 --> 55:47.357
CENTAC means
"Tactical Central" Unit.

55:47.428 --> 55:50.591
Our main objective
he/she went to unite to homicides

55:50.664 --> 55:52.097
with the division of drugs.

55:52.166 --> 55:56.227
They had connections
with the Antidrug Agency, with the FBI.

55:56.303 --> 55:57.702
We were fighting
with criminal's type

55:57.772 --> 55:59.330
with who we had not fought before.

55:59.407 --> 56:03.173
The instructions
that I gave they were very simple.

56:03.244 --> 56:06.577
In difficult times,
they take difficult measures.

56:06.647 --> 56:08.808
You could use any method

56:08.883 --> 56:11.374
to take out somebody of the streets.

56:11.452 --> 56:14.216
We will come undone of them
imprisoning them

56:14.288 --> 56:16.256
or killing them.

56:16.323 --> 56:17.551
It was a dedicated unit

56:17.625 --> 56:18.990
to be more active than it reactivates.

56:19.059 --> 56:21.289
It was a different way to make the work

56:21.362 --> 56:22.727
and it was necessary then

56:22.797 --> 56:24.458
due to the criminal's nature,

56:24.532 --> 56:26.557
so much with the Colombians
as with the Cubans

56:26.634 --> 56:27.931
that they came from Mariel.

56:28.002 --> 56:30.527
Miami seems to be had
transformed into the Lost Paradise.

56:30.604 --> 56:33.198
In the autumn-winter of 1981

56:33.274 --> 56:37.540
the article < i > Paradise Perdldo < /i>
it left in the magazine < i > Tlme.

56:37.611 --> 56:40.512
The magazine < i > Tlme < /i > it squashed Miami.

56:40.581 --> 56:42.208
The article of 9 pages

56:42.283 --> 56:43.716
it was focused in Miami

56:43.784 --> 56:47.117
as the problematic center of drugs,
crimes and refugees.

56:47.188 --> 56:49.383
The politicians in Miami and in Dade County

56:49.457 --> 56:51.448
they became crazy when Io saw.

56:51.525 --> 56:52.822
The first question is:

56:52.893 --> 56:54.622
"?Is it safe to visit Miami Beach?".

56:54.695 --> 56:56.526
- ? What would he/she tell them?
- Again I tell them

56:56.597 --> 56:58.724
that unless they come to traffic drugs,

56:58.799 --> 57:01.063
it will be so sure here as Io it would be

57:01.135 --> 57:03.399
in any part of the world,
included their own city.

57:03.471 --> 57:05.496
We were divided worlds between two.

57:05.573 --> 57:08.599
The capital of the sun and the amusement...

57:08.676 --> 57:09.643
and the capital of the murder.

57:09.710 --> 57:11.405
That era the idea of the article...

57:11.479 --> 57:13.037
Ios criminals won

57:13.113 --> 57:14.876
and we lost.

57:20.387 --> 57:22.014
I Was Born in Cali, Colombia.

57:22.089 --> 57:24.922
I arrived to EE UU in 1969.

57:24.992 --> 57:27.392
I Grew in Chicago,
it was mechanical with my dad.

57:27.461 --> 57:29.361
I worked for General Motors, there I learned

57:29.430 --> 57:30.897
how to open cars.

57:30.965 --> 57:32.865
Even young, they knew me
as one of the best

57:32.933 --> 57:34.195
thieves of cars in Chicago,

57:34.268 --> 57:36.236
and then, after the 80s,

57:36.303 --> 57:38.863
it was known to be assassin for the poster.

57:47.014 --> 57:49.039
JORGE "RIVl" AYALA
ASSASSIN

57:49.783 --> 57:52.308
He/she admitted their participation in 29 murders
during Guerra of the Cocaine.

57:52.386 --> 57:54.081
It is suspicious of other 12 murders.

57:58.158 --> 57:59.455
I joined with a group of types.

57:59.527 --> 58:01.825
We stole cars
and we sold them to the desguazaderos

58:01.896 --> 58:03.693
for 200 or 500 dollars each car.

58:03.764 --> 58:06.460
We used to steal 5 or 6 per night.
We were three.

58:06.534 --> 58:09.196
We made good money.
Better than working with dad.

58:09.270 --> 58:11.329
He/she came from a good family,
he/she had Io that needed.

58:11.405 --> 58:13.066
Not he/she needed to steal cars

58:13.140 --> 58:15.267
but it was for the money and for the enthusiasm

58:15.342 --> 58:16.900
of entering in the car of somebody

58:16.977 --> 58:19.605
and then to sell it.

58:20.481 --> 58:23.917
Chicago
August of 1980

58:23.984 --> 58:25.781
Restoring Tropicana.
We used to go

58:25.853 --> 58:27.514
there for the public phone.

58:27.588 --> 58:28.885
AIlÃ­ us Ilamaban.

58:28.956 --> 58:30.423
We used it as office.

58:30.491 --> 58:32.721
He/she took a specific place
where it parked

58:32.793 --> 58:34.260
and nobody more Io used.

58:34.328 --> 58:37.456
I arrive one morning,
and there was a parked car.

58:37.531 --> 58:38.862
I asked to the waiter

58:38.933 --> 58:40.628
of who it was. He/she said:

58:40.701 --> 58:42.726
"Of a fat fish of Miami."

58:42.803 --> 58:45.135
I told him/her that I cared
of who a carajo was.

58:45.205 --> 58:48.333
He/she wanted to move the car, so me Io IlevÃ©.

58:48.409 --> 58:50.843
The following morning
we were in the restaurant...

58:50.911 --> 58:53.471
and three Colombians entered
asking for Riverita.

58:53.547 --> 58:55.344
"I am looking for it
because my car was stolen."

58:55.416 --> 58:57.247
"I am the type that you look for, I am Rivi."

58:57.318 --> 58:59.582
"You stole me the car
and I want that me Io returns."

58:59.653 --> 59:00.881
"Not you Io will return.

59:00.955 --> 59:02.445
"Give me 500 dollars because now it is mine.

59:02.523 --> 59:04.718
"You parked where you didn't should."

59:04.792 --> 59:06.282
He/she began to laugh and he/she told me:

59:06.360 --> 59:08.225
"Yes that have eggs?do you know?".

59:08.295 --> 59:10.320
I said: I "listened that before."

59:10.397 --> 59:11.659
And he said: ?" What will you make?".

59:11.732 --> 59:14.701
"It is simple. 500 to recover it."

59:14.768 --> 59:18.101
He/she paid me, Ilaves takes out and he/she opens the cajuela.

59:21.508 --> 59:23.032
Ilena of weapons was.

59:23.110 --> 59:25.305
Revolvers, automatic guns.

59:25.379 --> 59:27.176
And he/she asks me if he/she had gone to Florida.

59:27.247 --> 59:29.511
"Yes, with my dad."
"?Do you have relatives there?"

59:29.583 --> 59:32.074
"Yes, about six."

59:32.152 --> 59:33.676
He/she asked me if Ilevarlo could Miami.

59:33.754 --> 59:36.052
"Clear?will you pay me?"

59:36.123 --> 59:37.852
He/she said that he/she would give me 5000 dollars.

59:37.925 --> 59:39.483
I told him/her that it was well.

59:41.028 --> 59:43.861
To Ilegar, he/she said that he/she had some businesses,

59:43.931 --> 59:45.728
maybe we could work for him

59:45.799 --> 59:48.267
and to make more money
if we stayed there.

59:48.335 --> 59:49.802
"?To make what?"
He/she said: To "give drug

59:49.870 --> 59:51.201
"and to pick up the money.

59:51.271 --> 59:53.205
"Maybe to sell marijuana
from time to time."

59:53.273 --> 59:55.867
The pay was good, 1000 dollars per day.

59:55.943 --> 59:58.173
The first time that we work was

59:58.245 --> 01:00:00.941
with people of the business of the drug.

01:00:01.015 --> 01:00:03.279
But he/she didn't have intentions of killing people.

01:00:03.350 --> 01:00:06.148
It was this way later, but...

01:00:06.220 --> 01:00:07.949
Weeks later
we were in Jacaranda,

01:00:08.022 --> 01:00:12.083
a night Colombian club in Miami.

01:00:12.159 --> 01:00:15.322
Thin he/she comes closer and he/she asks me:
"?Are you our supplier?".

01:00:15.396 --> 01:00:16.795
He/she tells me: He/she "hears, you should leave

01:00:16.864 --> 01:00:18.092
"because we will give a blow here.

01:00:18.165 --> 01:00:19.826
"Those of that table,

01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:23.461
"the six Colombians
that they are laughing and taking liquor

01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:25.664
"we will liquidate them. To all."

01:00:25.739 --> 01:00:27.639
I thanked him/her the.

01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:29.369
I asked him/her go to warn to my boys,

01:00:29.443 --> 01:00:32.503
except to Vanegas, the Black one,
because it was drugging.

01:00:32.579 --> 01:00:34.638
We tell him/her Black because it was very dark.

01:00:34.715 --> 01:00:36.478
It was black Colombian.

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:38.279
I went to the bathroom and I warned him/her.

01:00:38.352 --> 01:00:39.979
"We have to leave,
they will kill somebody."

01:00:40.054 --> 01:00:42.352
But I didn't tell him/her to who.

01:00:42.423 --> 01:00:45.256
It asked me him to give him/her
a moment and I came out.

01:00:45.325 --> 01:00:47.589
Then Vanegas went to that same table

01:00:47.661 --> 01:00:49.026
and he/she told them that they left,

01:00:49.096 --> 01:00:50.791
because it will have a shooting.

01:00:50.864 --> 01:00:53.298
It ruined the blow, it was an accident.

01:00:53.367 --> 01:00:54.561
He/she knew one of them

01:00:54.635 --> 01:00:56.102
so alone he/she tried to protect their friend.

01:00:56.170 --> 01:00:57.831
I was out, Vanegas came out.

01:00:57.905 --> 01:01:01.170
Behind Vanegas,
all pushed to leave.

01:01:01.241 --> 01:01:03.334
Thin Ilega in its moto, was angry.

01:01:03.410 --> 01:01:04.775
"You Io ruined everything

01:01:04.845 --> 01:01:05.869
"and it should not have warned them."

01:01:05.946 --> 01:01:07.277
I said: ?"Of what do you speak?".

01:01:07.347 --> 01:01:09.406
"You warned them, they didn't know,

01:01:09.483 --> 01:01:10.711
"and the only ones that Io knew

01:01:10.784 --> 01:01:13.150
"they were you. You."

01:01:13.220 --> 01:01:15.711
I told him/her that yes,
that I warned to my boys.

01:01:15.789 --> 01:01:17.723
I said: He/she "waits, I will speak with Black."

01:01:17.791 --> 01:01:19.088
I asked him/her if it had warned them.

01:01:19.159 --> 01:01:21.093
"I told to one of them of the shooting,

01:01:21.161 --> 01:01:23.789
"but he/she didn't know that it was that table."

01:01:23.864 --> 01:01:25.729
I told him/her that we were in problems.

01:01:25.799 --> 01:01:27.391
I returned and I told him/her that Io had made

01:01:27.468 --> 01:01:28.765
but that it was an accident.

01:01:28.836 --> 01:01:30.269
He/she told me that it was in problems

01:01:30.337 --> 01:01:32.828
with their boss,
and that the boss wanted to know me.

01:01:32.906 --> 01:01:35.136
"Tell to your boss that was an accident."

01:01:35.209 --> 01:01:36.699
"Not he/she wants to hear that,

01:01:36.777 --> 01:01:38.608
"alone you", he/she told me.

01:01:38.679 --> 01:01:39.941
"The boss wants to know you.

01:01:40.013 --> 01:01:43.915
"It is that or you are in problems."

01:01:43.984 --> 01:01:46.214
We get into the car and I tell him/her:

01:01:46.286 --> 01:01:47.878
"Won't they kill me?no?".

01:01:47.955 --> 01:01:50.583
ÃI responded: "Not I know,
I don't guarantee you anything, old."

01:01:52.659 --> 01:01:53.956
We had ruined it.

01:01:54.027 --> 01:01:55.995
We speak of killing six people.

01:01:56.063 --> 01:01:58.497
You already know, these types are not cowardly.

01:02:00.033 --> 01:02:02.160
He/she asked me if he/she had a he/she arms
and I told him/her that yes.

01:02:02.236 --> 01:02:03.601
But he/she had two.

01:02:03.670 --> 01:02:06.639
He/she had one of back
in the left leg.

01:02:06.707 --> 01:02:09.073
We went until Holiday Inn
in the freeway 95.

01:02:09.143 --> 01:02:12.271
I look and I see to four types leave the car.

01:02:12.346 --> 01:02:13.711
I asked: ?" Are they?".

01:02:13.781 --> 01:02:15.214
"Yes, but there is more to your left."

01:02:15.282 --> 01:02:16.909
I looked and there were four more than the other side.

01:02:16.984 --> 01:02:19.748
I came closer to the oldest type.

01:02:19.820 --> 01:02:21.845
"?Are You Rivi?"
"Yes", I told him/her.

01:02:21.922 --> 01:02:24.550
"They come with me."
We get into the car

01:02:24.625 --> 01:02:28.288
and in the back seat there was a lady.

01:02:28.362 --> 01:02:30.057
She gave the orders.

01:02:30.130 --> 01:02:32.064
She spoke,

01:02:32.132 --> 01:02:33.326
nobody said,

01:02:33.400 --> 01:02:34.628
Io that she said made.

01:02:34.701 --> 01:02:36.362
Their husband was ahead.

01:02:36.436 --> 01:02:38.529
Not he/she opened the mouth.
He/she didn't ask me questions.

01:02:38.605 --> 01:02:40.630
Alone she spoke,
saying me what to make.

01:02:40.707 --> 01:02:42.197
She is the one that has the power.

01:02:42.276 --> 01:02:44.801
A woman is speaking this way to me

01:02:44.878 --> 01:02:48.609
and he/she should have said him/her
that he/she left to the shit,

01:02:48.682 --> 01:02:50.013
but I thought: "No, not."

01:02:50.083 --> 01:02:51.482
He/she asked me if it was the one that there was

01:02:51.552 --> 01:02:54.851
wornout the blow.
"In certain way yes", I told him/her.

01:02:54.922 --> 01:02:58.153
He/she told me: Months "ago
that we are looking for them

01:02:58.225 --> 01:03:00.921
"and it is the first time that we see" them.

01:03:00.994 --> 01:03:02.723
And me Io had ruined.

01:03:02.796 --> 01:03:07.699
He/she tells me: I will tell "you what to make.
Find them

01:03:07.768 --> 01:03:11.067
"and kill them for me.
We will be this way by hand.

01:03:11.138 --> 01:03:13.038
"The two siblings" interest me.

01:03:13.106 --> 01:03:14.300
To the other ones four will kill them

01:03:14.374 --> 01:03:15.966
to be sat down in the table.

01:03:16.043 --> 01:03:18.136
"?lban to kill to other 4 to liquidate at 2?"

01:03:18.212 --> 01:03:19.702
He/she told me that he/she made this way the things.

01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:23.580
"To liquidate to the whole table.
To come undone of all."

01:03:25.586 --> 01:03:27.178
I was surprised that.

01:03:27.254 --> 01:03:30.348
I say, he/she spoke of murdering as...

01:03:30.424 --> 01:03:32.016
I asked him/her him to give me one week

01:03:32.092 --> 01:03:33.423
and that he/she would find them.

01:03:33.493 --> 01:03:35.586
"When you find them, IlÃ¡mame.

01:03:35.662 --> 01:03:38.654
"I will give you 50.000 dollars for each one."

01:03:38.732 --> 01:03:40.427
When I returned I asked questions to Thin.

01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:42.491
"? Who is this lady?"

01:03:42.569 --> 01:03:45.094
He/she tells me: He/she Is "the Godmother."

01:03:45.172 --> 01:03:47.436
"? Do you want to be more than the Godmother?"

01:03:47.507 --> 01:03:50.032
He/she said that he/she knew it of Colombia

01:03:50.110 --> 01:03:51.805
and that it was very dangerous.

01:03:51.879 --> 01:03:54.677
"If you don't complete, it will order you to kill."

01:03:54.748 --> 01:03:57.808
She was the biggest in that time.

01:03:57.885 --> 01:04:00.820
He/she was the Godmother of the traffic of cocaine.

01:04:00.888 --> 01:04:02.253
I return to the hotel,

01:04:02.322 --> 01:04:03.653
and I count the boys.

01:04:03.724 --> 01:04:05.316
Vanegas was there, and I told them

01:04:05.392 --> 01:04:07.019
that we were in serious problems.

01:04:07.094 --> 01:04:10.188
"If we don't find them
we will have to release ourselves,

01:04:10.264 --> 01:04:11.231
"because they will look for us...

01:04:11.298 --> 01:04:13.027
"this way me Io noticed."
Vanegas...

01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:15.694
he/she says that he/she can
to find the one bigger than them.

01:04:15.769 --> 01:04:17.498
"It is all Io that we need, to one."

01:04:17.571 --> 01:04:18.868
Through him, we find to the other one.

01:04:18.939 --> 01:04:22.067
I told him/her that Io Ilamara to the search

01:04:22.142 --> 01:04:23.803
and that it fixed an encounter that night.

01:04:23.877 --> 01:04:25.139
"We will kidnap him

01:04:25.212 --> 01:04:27.305
"and Io will give to this people."

01:04:27.381 --> 01:04:31.875
We call, nobody answered.
On the following day, same Io.

01:04:31.952 --> 01:04:36.480
To the third day they didn't answer
and it was losing the hope.

01:04:36.556 --> 01:04:38.683
To the fourth day, they answer.

01:04:38.759 --> 01:04:40.920
We are in being
in Ramada Inn.

01:04:40.994 --> 01:04:42.518
We told him/her that we had weapons

01:04:42.596 --> 01:04:44.029
and explosive to sell.

01:04:44.097 --> 01:04:45.826
But when IlegÃ³ to the hotel,

01:04:45.899 --> 01:04:48.333
Io made with its son of 15 years.

01:04:48.402 --> 01:04:50.529
Not we had the boy.

01:04:50.604 --> 01:04:53.937
Vanegas was intelligent
and you Io IlevÃ³ to the car.

01:04:54.007 --> 01:04:55.907
If we would not have to have ourselves him Ilevado.

01:04:55.976 --> 01:04:57.443
He/she speaks with Vanegas, he/she laughs.

01:04:57.511 --> 01:05:00.036
I am hidden,
and when Vanegas opens the cajuela

01:05:00.113 --> 01:05:02.172
I leave and I put him/her the weapon in the ribs.

01:05:02.249 --> 01:05:04.046
I tell him/her: I was looking for" "you.

01:05:04.117 --> 01:05:05.516
"I don't owe you anything, he/she tells me.

01:05:05.585 --> 01:05:07.382
"No. Somebody more it looks for you.

01:05:07.454 --> 01:05:09.547
"There is a lady looking for you.

01:05:09.623 --> 01:05:11.250
"You Ilama Griselda Blanco."

01:05:11.325 --> 01:05:14.658
"That fat dog, I don't owe him/her anything", he/she says.

01:05:14.728 --> 01:05:18.027
Cumbamba kicked him/her the face
and it removed him/her the teeth.

01:05:18.098 --> 01:05:20.032
"It shows respect for the lady.

01:05:20.100 --> 01:05:22.933
"Tell it to him when you see it,
we work for her."

01:05:23.003 --> 01:05:25.062
It became pale. He/she added: You will see "it

01:05:25.138 --> 01:05:28.301
"in a couple of hours."
There it began to tremble.

01:05:28.375 --> 01:05:31.742
One hour later Ilegan and you Io Ilevan.

01:05:31.812 --> 01:05:35.145
The following day I am at home at 16.00 o'clock.

01:05:35.215 --> 01:05:36.682
She enters in my house,

01:05:36.750 --> 01:05:38.911
he/she enters as if it was the owner.

01:05:38.986 --> 01:05:40.385
My wife was cooking.

01:05:40.454 --> 01:05:42.217
And he/she says: "I love the fish."

01:05:42.289 --> 01:05:45.452
He/she was eating
while I was how Io killed--

01:05:45.525 --> 01:05:46.992
Io cut in pieces--

01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:48.391
everything while we had dinner.

01:05:48.462 --> 01:05:49.895
I said: ?"Did it shoot him/her?".

01:05:49.963 --> 01:05:51.225
He/she said: "Yes, I shot him/her...

01:05:51.298 --> 01:05:53.357
"and Cumbamba Io cut,

01:05:53.433 --> 01:05:57.199
"Io put in a box
and Io wrapped for gift

01:05:57.270 --> 01:05:58.965
"with a monkey, and Io we leave

01:05:59.039 --> 01:06:01.530
"to some blocks of here, in the freeway."

01:06:01.608 --> 01:06:03.235
I said: ?"In my neighborhood?".
"Yes, he/she said.

01:06:03.310 --> 01:06:06.040
"We went toward the south to come to visit one another

01:06:06.113 --> 01:06:08.240
"and we saw that it was
a good place to throw it."

01:06:11.151 --> 01:06:12.709
I looked at it and I asked him/her if he/she joked.

01:06:12.786 --> 01:06:14.219
And he/she said: "No, it is seriously."

01:06:14.287 --> 01:06:15.652
I said: ?" Does Io always make?".

01:06:15.722 --> 01:06:17.121
He/she said that yes that he liked it.

01:06:17.190 --> 01:06:20.455
He likes us to cut people
and that we throw this way them.

01:06:23.897 --> 01:06:26.422
Griselda Blanco grew with his mother

01:06:26.500 --> 01:06:29.958
in MedellÃ­n, they were very poor.
He/she was a prostitute.

01:06:30.037 --> 01:06:32.301
Their criminal life began as pickpocket

01:06:32.372 --> 01:06:33.839
and then they moved to New York.

01:06:33.907 --> 01:06:35.807
There he/she entered in the business of the drug.

01:06:35.876 --> 01:06:41.246
I heard their name for the first time
at the end of 1973.

01:06:41.314 --> 01:06:43.179
In the confidential information

01:06:43.250 --> 01:06:45.445
she appeared like a threat

01:06:45.519 --> 01:06:46.577
for EE UU.

01:06:46.653 --> 01:06:47.847
Their business grew.

01:06:47.921 --> 01:06:50.151
He/she was a Colombian important trafficker.

01:06:50.223 --> 01:06:52.953
Rafa and Griselda were friends of the childhood.

01:06:53.026 --> 01:06:54.857
For that reason Rafa gave him/her everything.

01:06:54.928 --> 01:06:57.260
By the middle of the 70, they accused her

01:06:57.330 --> 01:06:59.958
in a case of cocaine
very big in New York,

01:07:00.033 --> 01:07:01.398
maybe the biggest in that moment,

01:07:01.468 --> 01:07:03.561
and after that he/she escaped and he/she escaped.

01:07:03.637 --> 01:07:06.435
He/she put on in search and it captures.

01:07:06.506 --> 01:07:09.771
The track lost him/her
from the moment of the accusation

01:07:09.843 --> 01:07:13.279
until they transferred me to Miami.

01:07:15.082 --> 01:07:17.346
Not we know
with certainty when it was in Miami.

01:07:17.417 --> 01:07:19.612
Maybe in the 78, non Io knew

01:07:19.686 --> 01:07:21.119
because he/she was a fugitive.

01:07:21.188 --> 01:07:22.815
But we knew that it was dealing.

01:07:22.889 --> 01:07:27.087
In the Latin deep culture, it is not common

01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:30.596
that a woman is
the head of their own organization,

01:07:30.664 --> 01:07:35.363
so I suppose
that he/she will have been an evil woman.

01:07:35.435 --> 01:07:37.801
Griselda should prove the Colombians

01:07:37.871 --> 01:07:39.395
that it was worthwhile to maintain

01:07:39.473 --> 01:07:40.838
the businesses with her.

01:07:40.907 --> 01:07:44.104
He liked people to fear it.
And they feared it.

01:07:44.177 --> 01:07:45.667
People were him/her so afraid

01:07:45.745 --> 01:07:48.407
that their reputation
it preceded it where it was.

01:07:48.482 --> 01:07:51.849
I made the error
of not knowing who was at the beginning.

01:07:51.918 --> 01:07:55.319
I met her in the department of Rafa,
I adored the Latins,

01:07:55.388 --> 01:07:56.878
and I asked to Rafa who was.

01:07:56.957 --> 01:07:58.254
And Rafa told me

01:07:58.325 --> 01:07:59.690
that I could not go to bed with her.

01:07:59.759 --> 01:08:01.192
I asked why not and he/she told me:

01:08:01.261 --> 01:08:03.627
"If you go to bed with her,
I will have to kill her."

01:08:03.697 --> 01:08:04.959
Then I asked to Max

01:08:05.031 --> 01:08:06.328
who she was.

01:08:06.399 --> 01:08:08.162
And he/she began to be
all those histories.

01:08:08.235 --> 01:08:09.532
It was hypochondriac.

01:08:09.603 --> 01:08:11.002
Quite decadent.

01:08:11.071 --> 01:08:12.265
A Ferrari was bought

01:08:12.339 --> 01:08:13.931
for Christmas for 80.000 dollars.

01:08:14.007 --> 01:08:15.736
It collected wealth.

01:08:15.809 --> 01:08:18.073
Their gifts of Christmas
they were always expensive.

01:08:18.145 --> 01:08:19.805
Eva PerÃ³n ring...

01:08:19.880 --> 01:08:21.073
jewels and other things.

01:08:21.148 --> 01:08:23.446
It consumed and it abused of the drugs.

01:08:23.517 --> 01:08:24.506
He/she was also lesbian.

01:08:24.584 --> 01:08:25.380
Paranoiac.

01:08:25.452 --> 01:08:26.441
Worse than the movies.

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:28.078
Not even < i > Mlaml Vlce < /i>

01:08:28.154 --> 01:08:29.645
it was so extravagant.

01:08:29.723 --> 01:08:31.953
He/she had bigger three children.

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:44.593
To last Io Ilamaron
Michael Corleone SepÃºlveda

01:08:44.671 --> 01:08:47.401
Io that is incredible.

01:08:47.474 --> 01:08:48.805
Their murders!skies!

01:08:48.875 --> 01:08:51.139
Ilamaban the Black Widow
because he/she had murdered

01:08:51.211 --> 01:08:53.202
to a couple of husbands,
or he/she had made them kill.

01:08:53.279 --> 01:08:54.872
It cut them literally the throat

01:08:54.948 --> 01:08:56.108
after going to bed with them.

01:08:56.183 --> 01:08:57.774
Not I know how many times Io made.

01:08:57.850 --> 01:08:59.819
"Non Io will make because Rafa will tell him/her

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:01.376
"you already know--" and Max said:

01:09:01.453 --> 01:09:02.648
"He/she will give same" Io.

01:09:02.721 --> 01:09:05.122
It could be annoying
one night and if you sleep with her

01:09:05.192 --> 01:09:06.955
it will cut you the throat. ? What will it happen?

01:09:07.027 --> 01:09:08.517
There will be a war.

01:09:08.595 --> 01:09:10.118
She was worse than anyone man

01:09:10.197 --> 01:09:11.562
involved in this.

01:09:11.631 --> 01:09:13.997
The first homicide of fame

01:09:14.067 --> 01:09:15.898
in that was involved, it was in Dadeland.

01:09:15.969 --> 01:09:17.459
There people of Griselda

01:09:17.537 --> 01:09:19.767
he/she entered to the liquor store and it flew him/her the head.

01:09:19.839 --> 01:09:21.238
Good, half of her.

01:09:21.308 --> 01:09:24.334
Of course, it was in July of 1979.

01:09:24.411 --> 01:09:26.276
I believe that he died for a swig.

01:09:26.345 --> 01:09:27.870
That was Io that established it

01:09:27.948 --> 01:09:30.746
as the more violent well-known trafficker.

01:09:30.817 --> 01:09:33.684
AIlÃ­ began the wars of the cocaine.

01:09:33.752 --> 01:09:36.881
And we begin to see more homicides.

01:09:36.957 --> 01:09:40.756
The paper of Griselda Blanco
it was very prominent

01:09:40.827 --> 01:09:43.022
in Io that Ilamamos
the Wars of the Cocaine.

01:09:43.095 --> 01:09:45.587
He/she murdered many Colombians and Cuban

01:09:45.665 --> 01:09:47.656
to obtain their position in the life.

01:09:47.734 --> 01:09:48.928
Wherever that they go

01:09:49.002 --> 01:09:51.903
Ilevan their special mark of savagery.

01:09:51.971 --> 01:09:54.805
This well-known woman as the Godmother...

01:09:54.874 --> 01:09:58.537
it was the responsible one
of most of the murders

01:09:58.612 --> 01:10:01.706
happened in Florida of the South in those days.

01:10:01.781 --> 01:10:06.081
In the years 1979, 1980, 1981 and 1982

01:10:06.152 --> 01:10:08.985
she murdered in Dade County.

01:10:12.659 --> 01:10:19.223
Griselda Blanco was...
the angel of the death.

01:10:19.299 --> 01:10:21.290
Not I know about any organization

01:10:21.368 --> 01:10:23.461
to the one that are attributed so many murders

01:10:23.536 --> 01:10:26.664
as to Griselda. Non Io knows.

01:10:26.740 --> 01:10:28.503
It could be for simple things.

01:10:28.575 --> 01:10:30.236
If it was in a restaurant
the previous night...

01:10:30.310 --> 01:10:32.210
As when we were
to The Peroz in the beach.

01:10:32.279 --> 01:10:33.712
He/she could be eating

01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:35.213
and the owner gave him/her problems or something like that.

01:10:35.282 --> 01:10:37.307
There was an enormous type,
he/she began to speak pavadas.

01:10:37.384 --> 01:10:38.715
And he/she spent of alive with her.

01:10:38.785 --> 01:10:40.150
And she says: "To the shit with the owner,

01:10:40.220 --> 01:10:41.482
"I will destroy him/her the business."

01:10:41.554 --> 01:10:43.988
And we left.

01:10:44.057 --> 01:10:45.490
Some types passed in motorcycles

01:10:45.558 --> 01:10:47.287
they occurred turn

01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:49.851
and they began to shoot
to those that waited

01:10:49.929 --> 01:10:51.260
to enter to the place.

01:10:51.331 --> 01:10:52.855
And then Io lead Ilenaron

01:10:52.932 --> 01:10:54.229
fair in the door.

01:10:54.301 --> 01:10:55.268
They were about accusing me

01:10:55.335 --> 01:10:57.064
but it was outside of the city.

01:10:57.137 --> 01:11:01.164
He/she will have entered with mistaken people.

01:11:01.241 --> 01:11:03.607
Riverita became
in the main assassin of Griselda.

01:11:03.677 --> 01:11:05.406
It was always with me and other three.

01:11:05.478 --> 01:11:08.003
- He/she had an army with her.
- A cast of mischievous.

01:11:08.081 --> 01:11:12.381
Their people were... almost as of movie.

01:11:12.452 --> 01:11:14.181
- He/she Had Paco.
- Paco SepÃºlveda.

01:11:14.254 --> 01:11:17.781
Diego SepÃºlveda. Toto.
Carlos Vanegas. Alonso Ayala.

01:11:17.857 --> 01:11:19.620
A panda of scruffy.

01:11:19.693 --> 01:11:21.024
As the gang that didn't shoot well.

01:11:21.094 --> 01:11:23.255
Uber, Guillermo, VelÃ¡squez.

01:11:23.330 --> 01:11:25.059
Alone they killed people.

01:11:25.131 --> 01:11:26.098
Cumbamba.

01:11:26.166 --> 01:11:27.895
Monteco, Diego Escobar.

01:11:27.967 --> 01:11:28.899
Oscar Mario.

01:11:28.968 --> 01:11:30.526
Brave Jaime.

01:11:30.603 --> 01:11:32.628
They were bodyguard and assassins.

01:11:32.706 --> 01:11:35.504
They lived off this.
Some are farmaceutas,

01:11:35.575 --> 01:11:37.805
other trash cans,
and these they were murderous.

01:11:37.877 --> 01:11:39.367
It was all Io that made.

01:11:39.446 --> 01:11:42.279
Dog Castro was his main assassin.

01:11:42.349 --> 01:11:44.112
For me it was one of the best

01:11:44.184 --> 01:11:45.310
that Griselda had.

01:11:45.385 --> 01:11:47.649
It is a legend,
it always caught their man.

01:11:47.721 --> 01:11:50.713
Osvaldo, son of Griselda.
Then he/she had 15 years.

01:11:50.790 --> 01:11:51.757
He/she wanted to live quick.

01:11:51.825 --> 01:11:53.417
It carried weapons and all that.

01:11:53.493 --> 01:11:55.984
It moved 300 and 400 kilos of cocaine per month.

01:11:56.062 --> 01:11:57.791
Everything orchestrated by their mother.

01:11:57.864 --> 01:12:00.424
He/she wanted to be similar to Don Corleone,

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.128
he/she wanted to act as him, and Io made this way.

01:12:03.203 --> 01:12:07.105
He/she had cockerel attitude, due to their mother.

01:12:07.173 --> 01:12:09.266
It was in the club night Faces

01:12:09.342 --> 01:12:11.310
with their friends and their girlfriend.

01:12:11.378 --> 01:12:12.811
Dog lived close.

01:12:12.879 --> 01:12:15.541
And Osvaldo thought:
"I will stay here,

01:12:15.615 --> 01:12:16.912
"in the house of Dog."

01:12:16.983 --> 01:12:18.450
It managed the car until the entrance

01:12:18.518 --> 01:12:21.419
almost until the door, skidding

01:12:21.488 --> 01:12:22.853
and making noise.
Then Dog came out.

01:12:22.922 --> 01:12:24.822
And he/she told him/her that he/she left.

01:12:24.891 --> 01:12:26.222
He/she told him/her that if it didn't allow him/her to spend the night

01:12:26.292 --> 01:12:27.725
it would count their mother.
And Dog told him/her:

01:12:27.794 --> 01:12:28.852
"I care a carajo.

01:12:28.928 --> 01:12:30.020
"I care a carajo your mom,

01:12:30.096 --> 01:12:31.757
"tell to your mom that leaves to the shit."

01:12:31.831 --> 01:12:33.492
Dog Io kicked in the ass and he/she told him/her

01:12:33.566 --> 01:12:35.227
that he/she entered in the car
and that he/she left.

01:12:35.301 --> 01:12:37.235
"Tell to your mom that I kicked your ass."

01:12:37.303 --> 01:12:39.567
The boy returned and it counted his mom.

01:12:39.639 --> 01:12:41.300
One of the things with her was

01:12:41.374 --> 01:12:42.705
that one could not play their children.

01:12:42.776 --> 01:12:45.301
Not it cared who was,
the person would die.

01:12:45.512 --> 01:12:47.810
There was always somebody he/she made something bad.

01:12:47.881 --> 01:12:50.008
If Io made or not, it was reason so that her

01:12:50.083 --> 01:12:52.017
he/she had problems with them.

01:12:52.085 --> 01:12:53.677
That IlamÃ³ takes a long time to the house.

01:12:53.753 --> 01:12:55.618
"Tell him/her that we are in war,

01:12:55.688 --> 01:12:58.020
"that he/she is no longer my friend, he/she is my enemy.

01:12:58.091 --> 01:13:00.753
"So if Io sees, shoot him/her."

01:13:00.827 --> 01:13:02.886
Rivi and their people were in that area.

01:13:02.962 --> 01:13:04.827
Not it will be easy, because he was good.

01:13:04.898 --> 01:13:06.195
If we make a mistake, Io loses

01:13:06.266 --> 01:13:08.029
or he/she murders us.

01:13:08.101 --> 01:13:12.470
Rivi, the driver
and another gunman went in a van.

01:13:12.539 --> 01:13:15.337
I will make the shots.
He/she had a M16.

01:13:15.408 --> 01:13:17.535
I tell to the driver: "Come closer,

01:13:17.610 --> 01:13:18.975
"of window to window,

01:13:19.045 --> 01:13:20.342
"and I will shoot for the door."

01:13:20.413 --> 01:13:22.313
He/she knew that if he/she opened the door

01:13:22.382 --> 01:13:24.407
in movement, he would realize.

01:13:24.484 --> 01:13:25.815
He/she knew all the tricks.

01:13:25.885 --> 01:13:28.080
Dog opened the door of the garage,

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:29.985
it left toward the street 168

01:13:30.056 --> 01:13:32.581
and then it rotated toward the national one 1.

01:13:32.659 --> 01:13:34.024
In the national one 1 had a traffic light

01:13:34.093 --> 01:13:36.118
at some 800m of distance.

01:13:36.196 --> 01:13:37.458
We had a lot of time.

01:13:37.530 --> 01:13:39.930
It is here where they

01:13:39.999 --> 01:13:43.093
to reach Dog, to put on in parallel,

01:13:43.169 --> 01:13:46.468
going to the west. Them to the left,
Dog to the right.

01:13:46.539 --> 01:13:48.166
I took the machine gun
and I shot to the wheels

01:13:48.241 --> 01:13:50.709
trying to fly them.
It lost the control of the car

01:13:50.777 --> 01:13:53.337
and almost it collides with a wall,
but Io controlled.

01:13:53.413 --> 01:13:54.573
He/she returned to the road.

01:13:54.647 --> 01:13:56.740
In that moment they came closer
to the national one 1.

01:13:56.816 --> 01:13:58.977
There we were, near the red light.

01:13:59.052 --> 01:14:00.576
There was a gas station to the right.

01:14:00.653 --> 01:14:02.348
When coming closer to the national one 1

01:14:02.422 --> 01:14:04.549
Dog cuts for the gas station,

01:14:04.624 --> 01:14:08.287
they go enough express,
he/she leaves to the north for the national one 1,

01:14:08.361 --> 01:14:11.091
and there it loses to the type that shot him/her.

01:14:11.164 --> 01:14:13.564
We look for for all sides, non Io saw.

01:14:13.633 --> 01:14:15.567
We left and we said:

01:14:15.635 --> 01:14:17.728
"We ruin" it.

01:14:17.804 --> 01:14:19.897
Griselda me Ilama the following day.

01:14:20.069 --> 01:14:21.798
And he/she says: They "murdered their son.

01:14:21.870 --> 01:14:24.964
"He/she was sleeping in the back part

01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:27.304
"and the bullets crossed the cajuela

01:14:27.376 --> 01:14:30.436
"and they gave him/her in the head."

01:14:30.512 --> 01:14:32.503
I told him/her that non Io saw,
because of having him fact

01:14:32.581 --> 01:14:34.412
we had never played that car.

01:14:34.483 --> 01:14:37.611
He/she told me: It asked "me him to tell you

01:14:37.686 --> 01:14:41.884
"that it will catch you, because he/she saw" you.

01:14:41.957 --> 01:14:43.322
I told him/her that it was well.

01:14:43.392 --> 01:14:45.155
Dog was a federal fugitive.

01:14:45.227 --> 01:14:46.285
It was wrapped in the traffic

01:14:46.362 --> 01:14:48.489
and there was an arrest order
of the Antidrug Agency.

01:14:48.564 --> 01:14:50.794
For that reason he/she didn't go

01:14:50.866 --> 01:14:52.731
to denounce the fact to the police.

01:14:52.801 --> 01:14:56.931
He/she returned to their house,
it put to the baby in the bathtub.

01:14:57.006 --> 01:14:57.995
IlenÃ³ of ice

01:14:58.073 --> 01:14:59.870
Io could preserve this way the whole afternoon.

01:14:59.942 --> 01:15:01.739
ÃI and their wife
the whole afternoon Ilorando happened

01:15:01.810 --> 01:15:04.108
with the baby in the bathtub.

01:15:04.179 --> 01:15:06.170
The following day, Ilamaron to the police

01:15:06.248 --> 01:15:10.014
to warn us where the body to find.

01:15:10.085 --> 01:15:13.054
These are Ilamadas that JesÃºs made

01:15:13.122 --> 01:15:14.111
to the room of complaints.

01:15:14.189 --> 01:15:16.783
"Please,
I have just left the body without life

01:15:16.859 --> 01:15:18.520
"of the baby that you/they killed yesterday.

01:15:18.594 --> 01:15:20.027
"Excuse, yesterday some bandits

01:15:20.095 --> 01:15:21.653
"in a white van

01:15:21.730 --> 01:15:23.425
"they shot me with a machine gun

01:15:23.499 --> 01:15:25.399
"and the boy was seated and Io killed

01:15:25.467 --> 01:15:27.765
"in the avenue Seventh and the street 53.

01:15:27.836 --> 01:15:29.497
"The boy's body that you/they killed yesterday,

01:15:29.571 --> 01:15:30.697
"the bandits."

01:15:30.773 --> 01:15:31.933
This is the mosque

01:15:32.007 --> 01:15:34.703
where they left
the body of Johnnie Castro.

01:15:34.777 --> 01:15:36.369
Dog looked for the church

01:15:36.445 --> 01:15:39.414
where they had confirmed
to Johnnie months before.

01:15:39.481 --> 01:15:40.743
Not he/she could find it

01:15:40.816 --> 01:15:42.010
and this was Io better than it got.

01:15:42.084 --> 01:15:44.314
He/she found this mosque
in the same neighborhood.

01:15:44.386 --> 01:15:48.914
The boy was wrapped in a sheet.

01:15:48.991 --> 01:15:51.960
There were three roses in their hands.

01:15:52.027 --> 01:15:55.019
A rose for each anus of life,

01:15:55.097 --> 01:15:58.032
and I believe that a passport.

01:15:58.100 --> 01:15:59.795
Here it is.

01:15:59.868 --> 01:16:03.065
He/she knew that they needed the passport
to prove who was.

01:16:03.138 --> 01:16:06.164
He/she was born March 10 1979,

01:16:06.241 --> 01:16:10.575
so he/she almost had three years...

01:16:10.646 --> 01:16:12.443
almost three years.

01:16:12.514 --> 01:16:14.641
We realized that it was Colombian

01:16:14.716 --> 01:16:16.240
for the passport, etc.

01:16:16.318 --> 01:16:17.910
We call the sergeant Singleton,

01:16:18.020 --> 01:16:19.510
of CENTAC and to their people.

01:16:19.588 --> 01:16:21.613
We knew that it was
Griselda Blanco and their people.

01:16:21.690 --> 01:16:23.851
We obtained the name of Riverita,

01:16:23.926 --> 01:16:25.894
but he/she swims in short,
not even a picture

01:16:25.961 --> 01:16:27.895
that he/she says: "This is the one that we look for."

01:16:27.963 --> 01:16:29.828
Anything of that.

01:16:29.898 --> 01:16:33.026
I don't remember another case
where they killed a boy.

01:16:33.102 --> 01:16:35.263
To small Johnnie Castro

01:16:35.337 --> 01:16:37.202
Io killed to be close

01:16:37.272 --> 01:16:40.730
of their father, a looked for Colombian

01:16:40.809 --> 01:16:43.334
for some of the Horsemen of the Cocaine.

01:16:43.412 --> 01:16:45.073
I was a policeman beginner.

01:16:45.147 --> 01:16:47.638
He/she made less than an anus that was there

01:16:47.716 --> 01:16:51.152
and my son had
almost the same age then.

01:16:51.220 --> 01:16:52.744
People ask me

01:16:52.821 --> 01:16:54.311
if it bothers me to see the bodies.

01:16:54.389 --> 01:16:57.381
Never, except for this case.

01:16:57.459 --> 01:17:00.917
That hit me very hard

01:17:00.996 --> 01:17:03.521
because he/she had children of that age.

01:17:03.599 --> 01:17:05.692
He/she was an innocent, innocent baby.

01:17:05.767 --> 01:17:07.359
Griselda said: "To the carajo,

01:17:07.436 --> 01:17:09.131
"at least we gave" him/her.

01:17:09.204 --> 01:17:10.728
Io not even complained.

01:17:10.806 --> 01:17:12.569
To her... he didn't care anything.

01:17:12.641 --> 01:17:14.165
Although the Colombians were wild

01:17:14.243 --> 01:17:15.540
in the way in that you/they made the things,

01:17:15.611 --> 01:17:18.079
she made them in a stupid way.

01:17:18.147 --> 01:17:19.273
But it bothered a lot of people,

01:17:19.348 --> 01:17:20.713
not alone in EE UU,

01:17:20.782 --> 01:17:22.147
but to people in Colombia.

01:17:22.217 --> 01:17:24.151
All said
that she was outside of control

01:17:24.219 --> 01:17:26.084
and that it would ruin the business of all.

01:17:26.155 --> 01:17:28.953
Ochoa told him/her that alone it killed

01:17:29.024 --> 01:17:30.389
to those involved,

01:17:30.459 --> 01:17:32.654
and that he/she avoided to murder to innocent.

01:17:32.728 --> 01:17:34.093
The only thing that I remember

01:17:34.163 --> 01:17:35.494
it is that the Colombians wanted

01:17:35.564 --> 01:17:38.192
that she stayed far from Miami.

01:17:38.267 --> 01:17:39.825
He/she received a lot of pressure of the other ones.

01:17:39.902 --> 01:17:40.960
"To the carajo with them.

01:17:41.036 --> 01:17:42.765
"Here Io that I want make.

01:17:42.838 --> 01:17:45.170
"If they don't like that come me to look for."

01:17:45.240 --> 01:17:47.140
This way nomÃ¡s.

01:17:47.209 --> 01:17:49.575
He/she heard conversations in Spanish with Rafa

01:17:49.645 --> 01:17:50.942
because I was in the house.

01:17:51.013 --> 01:17:52.537
"!Prostitute's daughter!

01:17:52.614 --> 01:17:55.674
"!Another time makes me same Io!
?Now what I will make?"

01:17:55.751 --> 01:17:57.378
He/she knew that him IlamarÃ­a to Colombia

01:17:57.452 --> 01:17:58.680
and he/she would ask them

01:17:58.754 --> 01:18:00.312
what he/she should make, but this woman

01:18:00.389 --> 01:18:02.482
he/she always survived, because it

01:18:02.558 --> 01:18:06.426
to have died a lot of time before,
much.

01:18:06.495 --> 01:18:07.928
And of turn to the work.

01:18:09.898 --> 01:18:11.422
Riverita...

01:18:11.500 --> 01:18:13.627
he/she transformed into their favorite assassin.

01:18:13.702 --> 01:18:15.431
As if it was security.

01:18:15.504 --> 01:18:16.994
As if it was the boss of security.

01:18:17.072 --> 01:18:18.539
Nobody knew where he/she lived but me.

01:18:18.607 --> 01:18:22.236
Many of the meetings
they were in the house of Rafa, of Max.

01:18:22.311 --> 01:18:24.438
In fact, I met Max in their house.

01:18:24.513 --> 01:18:25.912
I was there with Griselda.

01:18:25.981 --> 01:18:28.040
Starting from there, I never liked it.

01:18:28.116 --> 01:18:30.311
He/she told to Griselda
that it didn't trust the damned one.

01:18:30.385 --> 01:18:31.784
"Not I trust him." I told him/her:

01:18:31.853 --> 01:18:33.081
"If you don't go away,

01:18:33.155 --> 01:18:34.622
"he will put you in the jail.

01:18:34.690 --> 01:18:36.681
"Next time that Io sees, Io kills."

01:18:36.758 --> 01:18:38.248
But him you Io counted Rafa

01:18:38.327 --> 01:18:39.794
and they returned with men
to make sure

01:18:39.861 --> 01:18:41.226
that anything passes Max.

01:18:41.296 --> 01:18:42.991
"He/she takes care of Max, he/she is my godfather."

01:18:43.065 --> 01:18:45.659
"To the carajo with Max,
I will kill to the damned one."

01:18:45.734 --> 01:18:47.133
"?Will you kill me?", he/she told me.

01:18:47.202 --> 01:18:50.035
"Not now, yes later."

01:18:50.105 --> 01:18:53.438
It was necessary to respect to the type, because he/she came

01:18:53.508 --> 01:18:57.137
threatening, Ileno of weapons,
with that whole people.

01:18:57.212 --> 01:18:58.645
It is about a type...

01:18:58.714 --> 01:19:01.512
anyone that enters with a retinue

01:19:01.583 --> 01:19:03.050
it is somebody important.

01:19:03.118 --> 01:19:05.086
Non Ilamaba the attention, you know.

01:19:05.153 --> 01:19:07.178
He/she had a house in Palm Beach

01:19:07.256 --> 01:19:09.349
another in San AgustÃ­n and two in Chicago.

01:19:09.424 --> 01:19:11.221
He/she had many cars.

01:19:11.293 --> 01:19:13.124
He/she bought them to my fiancÃ©s also.

01:19:13.195 --> 01:19:14.856
My wife, a couple of fiancÃ©s.

01:19:14.930 --> 01:19:18.024
In this life... it is necessary to have a couple.

01:19:18.100 --> 01:19:19.863
What wanted, Io that I liked,

01:19:19.935 --> 01:19:21.163
Io saw in the street and Io he/she bought.

01:19:21.236 --> 01:19:23.227
Not he/she had to worry about the price.

01:19:23.305 --> 01:19:25.705
Not I know, type world of the show...

01:19:25.774 --> 01:19:27.207
That thing type.

01:19:27.276 --> 01:19:28.971
It was an attractive type that he/she spoke English

01:19:29.044 --> 01:19:30.636
and he/she had a lot of charisma.

01:19:30.712 --> 01:19:33.408
It is one of the reasons
for those that he/she pleased him/her well.

01:19:33.482 --> 01:19:34.710
I grew here.

01:19:34.783 --> 01:19:36.307
Not I crossed the water

01:19:36.385 --> 01:19:38.216
and I began... and they put me in the street.

01:19:38.287 --> 01:19:40.983
Although it was maybe similar of bad and he/she murdered

01:19:41.056 --> 01:19:42.387
to more than anyone of the other ones.

01:19:42.457 --> 01:19:43.822
I am of good family,
but I grew in the street

01:19:43.892 --> 01:19:45.291
in Chicago.

01:19:45.360 --> 01:19:47.260
I was a bad boy from the beginning.

01:19:47.329 --> 01:19:49.354
An assassin of cold blood.

01:19:49.431 --> 01:19:51.991
The truth is that I didn't fall well,

01:19:52.067 --> 01:19:55.525
because he/she used to bounce...

01:19:55.604 --> 01:19:58.573
about people that had murdered.

01:19:58.640 --> 01:20:01.165
Once I lowered the window
and I shot him/her with a MAC-11

01:20:01.243 --> 01:20:02.437
in the face.

01:20:02.511 --> 01:20:04.411
Not I want to hear: "Ah, murdered to this type

01:20:04.479 --> 01:20:05.605
"here, there...".

01:20:05.681 --> 01:20:06.978
I will murder anyone in EE UU

01:20:07.049 --> 01:20:09.313
or in Europe, or where they send me, Io will make.

01:20:09.384 --> 01:20:12.410
Not I want to hear their bounces on that.

01:20:12.487 --> 01:20:15.047
Of those that UU worked in EE,
it was the best.

01:20:15.123 --> 01:20:17.853
It was disconcerting, somehow

01:20:17.926 --> 01:20:20.451
because he was this woman's assassin

01:20:20.529 --> 01:20:22.895
or Io that is that it was.

01:20:22.964 --> 01:20:24.329
During the years 82 and 84,

01:20:24.399 --> 01:20:26.993
he was who she used

01:20:27.069 --> 01:20:30.596
exclusively for their murders.

01:20:30.672 --> 01:20:31.764
My reputation was

01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:35.037
that if it was behind you, it would catch you.

01:20:35.110 --> 01:20:37.078
If you escape, I will catch you.

01:20:37.145 --> 01:20:38.373
If there was a debt to get paid,

01:20:38.447 --> 01:20:40.142
he took charge of charging it.

01:20:40.215 --> 01:20:42.945
Many clients said
that they were late

01:20:43.018 --> 01:20:44.178
and she told them: "If you don't come tomorrow,

01:20:44.252 --> 01:20:45.276
"Rivi will go for you."

01:20:45.354 --> 01:20:46.651
"No, non Io sends."

01:20:49.391 --> 01:20:52.224
Alfredo Lorenzo
he/she was client of Griselda Blanco.

01:20:52.294 --> 01:20:53.784
Griselda ordered me him to give him/her

01:20:53.862 --> 01:20:55.159
5 kilos of cocaine.

01:20:55.230 --> 01:20:58.222
Then they were 50.000 dollars each one,
at 250 each 30 grams.

01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:00.393
They gave him/her cocaine in consignment.

01:21:00.469 --> 01:21:01.902
Io made this way Griselda.

01:21:01.970 --> 01:21:03.665
"? How many days do you need to pay me?"

01:21:03.739 --> 01:21:06.936
"One week."
"I will give you two weeks."

01:21:07.008 --> 01:21:10.637
When the two weeks passed,
he/she no longer wanted the money,

01:21:10.712 --> 01:21:12.304
but the person's life.

01:21:12.381 --> 01:21:14.110
To Rivi Io sent to charge the debt.

01:21:14.182 --> 01:21:16.241
I went to their house to look for the money.

01:21:16.318 --> 01:21:18.445
And alone he/she gave me excuses.

01:21:18.520 --> 01:21:20.818
"Tell him/her that he/she gives me more credit

01:21:20.889 --> 01:21:22.550
"and I will return him/her the money."

01:21:22.624 --> 01:21:26.424
I didn't tell him/her anything, the type gave me pity.

01:21:26.495 --> 01:21:28.190
Rivi realized that Lorenzo

01:21:28.263 --> 01:21:30.823
it played with him.

01:21:30.899 --> 01:21:32.560
So you Io informed Griselda.

01:21:32.634 --> 01:21:35.626
He/she told me: Io that you should make" "already know.

01:21:35.704 --> 01:21:38.537
Their destination was written.

01:21:38.607 --> 01:21:41.940
With Griselda, if you didn't pay, you died.

01:21:42.010 --> 01:21:45.776
Until the mafia he/she would have
a class of code of honor.

01:21:45.847 --> 01:21:48.441
The Italian would be about solving

01:21:48.517 --> 01:21:50.451
how to recover the money.

01:21:50.519 --> 01:21:53.283
Maybe later, they would give him/her a beating

01:21:53.355 --> 01:21:55.880
but three weeks later it would heal.

01:21:55.957 --> 01:21:58.949
When Colombian Ilegaron,
the beatings finished.

01:21:59.027 --> 01:22:01.461
Those Latins of hot blood

01:22:01.530 --> 01:22:02.554
they don't think first.

01:22:02.631 --> 01:22:04.656
First act and they think later.

01:22:04.733 --> 01:22:06.530
Although they murdered to the whole family

01:22:06.601 --> 01:22:08.034
then there they would think:

01:22:08.103 --> 01:22:09.661
"Skies, I finish of...

01:22:09.738 --> 01:22:11.205
"? How will I recover the money?".

01:22:11.273 --> 01:22:12.934
And it is too much afternoon to recover it.

01:22:13.008 --> 01:22:14.908
Not it is for the money,
but to send a message.

01:22:14.976 --> 01:22:16.910
"Don't swindle me, don't enter with me,

01:22:16.978 --> 01:22:18.912
"because I will kill you or I will make them to kill you."

01:22:18.980 --> 01:22:22.040
He/she said: "Kill them."
And him Io made.

01:22:25.821 --> 01:22:29.086
Miguel was to my right,
Oscar Murillo, Born,

01:22:29.157 --> 01:22:30.988
to the left, and I hit the door.

01:22:31.059 --> 01:22:32.219
Alfredo opens the door

01:22:32.294 --> 01:22:34.159
and when Io ago
I put him/her the weapon in the ribs.

01:22:34.229 --> 01:22:36.129
It points out him/her that he/she doesn't make noise.

01:22:36.198 --> 01:22:37.187
I ask him/her for the wife.

01:22:37.265 --> 01:22:38.789
He/she said that he/she was cooking.

01:22:38.867 --> 01:22:40.357
I went until her and he/she tells me:

01:22:40.435 --> 01:22:42.266
"Not I know Io what it happens,

01:22:42.337 --> 01:22:44.362
"but I ask him/her him not to hurt my children."

01:22:44.439 --> 01:22:46.999
Three children, two daughters, a son.

01:22:47.075 --> 01:22:49.873
I believe that the daughters had 6 and 4 years.

01:22:49.945 --> 01:22:52.345
And the son was a baby.

01:22:52.414 --> 01:22:54.644
I said: "No, I won't hurt your children."

01:22:54.716 --> 01:22:57.310
Griselda had told me that he/she murdered them.

01:22:57.385 --> 01:22:59.853
I supposed that single Io would kill him.

01:22:59.921 --> 01:23:01.513
He/she spoke with her and I heard two shots,

01:23:01.590 --> 01:23:03.785
a couple... Io that happened knew.

01:23:03.859 --> 01:23:05.850
Miguel had killed Alfredo.

01:23:12.334 --> 01:23:15.132
I requested to Oscar that watched over her,
that he/she would return.

01:23:15.203 --> 01:23:16.568
I went to the other room.

01:23:16.638 --> 01:23:19.573
I asked to Miguel if it was made,

01:23:19.641 --> 01:23:21.632
and he/she told me that yes.

01:23:21.710 --> 01:23:24.702
When we were speaking, I heard a scream

01:23:24.779 --> 01:23:26.178
and then I heard a metralleta.

01:23:27.549 --> 01:23:28.743
I returned to the room

01:23:28.817 --> 01:23:31.115
and he told me: "She was about being thrown above."

01:23:31.186 --> 01:23:34.383
Oscar had shot him/her
10, 15 times in the chest

01:23:34.456 --> 01:23:36.686
and she continued alive, making...

01:23:36.758 --> 01:23:39.318
some strange noises,
it left him/her blood of the mouth,

01:23:39.394 --> 01:23:42.124
he/she was dying.
I grabbed Miguel's weapon,

01:23:42.197 --> 01:23:45.166
a.380 with muffler and I shot him/her

01:23:45.233 --> 01:23:49.294
twice in the head
so that he/she stopped to suffer.

01:23:51.106 --> 01:23:52.937
I told them that we left.

01:23:53.008 --> 01:23:54.873
But Griselda said it to Miguel

01:23:54.943 --> 01:23:57.275
that it was necessary to kill all.

01:23:57.345 --> 01:23:58.505
I asked him/her of what he/she spoke.

01:23:58.580 --> 01:24:02.516
"Alone they are the children."

01:24:02.584 --> 01:24:04.108
And he/she tells me that he/she will murder the children.

01:24:04.185 --> 01:24:05.652
I told him/her that non Io made.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:06.709
"She told me

01:24:06.788 --> 01:24:07.720
"that they are worth extra,

01:24:07.789 --> 01:24:08.983
"so I will win myself the money."

01:24:09.057 --> 01:24:10.957
I told him/her that it would not kill the children.

01:24:11.026 --> 01:24:14.223
And he/she leaves in address to the children.

01:24:14.296 --> 01:24:15.422
I took out my weapon and I told him/her

01:24:15.497 --> 01:24:16.896
that you outside of the house.

01:24:16.965 --> 01:24:18.956
Miguel became crazy:
"We have to kill the girl."

01:24:19.034 --> 01:24:21.798
I said: "No, coarse.

01:24:21.870 --> 01:24:23.861
"It is hour of leaving of here."

01:24:23.939 --> 01:24:27.705
I had to take out them to gun tip.

01:24:27.776 --> 01:24:29.801
Alfredo and Griselda Lorenzo

01:24:29.878 --> 01:24:30.936
they were opposing dead

01:24:31.012 --> 01:24:33.412
in June of 1982 in their house.

01:24:33.481 --> 01:24:36.109
It was a modest house
in the area of Rhodes.

01:24:36.184 --> 01:24:40.245
In 1982 it had returned to CENTAC.

01:24:40.322 --> 01:24:43.291
I received Nelson's Ilamada Andrew,

01:24:43.358 --> 01:24:46.088
that he/she was a detective
of homicides of Miami.

01:24:46.161 --> 01:24:47.753
The bodies were in different rooms,

01:24:47.829 --> 01:24:49.296
and who made the homicide

01:24:49.364 --> 01:24:51.355
he/she left the children in the house

01:24:51.433 --> 01:24:52.866
with their dead parents. They found

01:24:52.934 --> 01:24:54.799
to the girls and the boy

01:24:54.869 --> 01:24:58.498
playing with the body
bloodstained of the mother

01:24:58.573 --> 01:25:01.007
inside the house.

01:25:01.076 --> 01:25:03.943
They paid us and I explained to him/her.

01:25:04.012 --> 01:25:06.207
I told him/her that there were not
murdered the children.

01:25:06.281 --> 01:25:08.806
He/she got angry and he/she said:
"The order was to kill all."

01:25:08.883 --> 01:25:10.578
When she says all, they are all.

01:25:10.652 --> 01:25:12.552
I told him/her that he/she had made the decision

01:25:12.621 --> 01:25:14.987
of not killing them.
"?Why?"

01:25:15.056 --> 01:25:18.253
"Because they are babies."

01:25:18.326 --> 01:25:19.623
After Johnnie Castro,

01:25:19.694 --> 01:25:20.922
when they killed the boy,

01:25:20.996 --> 01:25:22.896
I believe that he/she got used after it.

01:25:22.964 --> 01:25:25.330
You already know, to murder children.

01:25:25.400 --> 01:25:26.890
He liked to be in war.

01:25:26.968 --> 01:25:28.458
He/she spoke every day of it.

01:25:28.536 --> 01:25:30.231
We have to catch to such and to which,

01:25:30.305 --> 01:25:32.034
we have to eliminate it.

01:25:32.674 --> 01:25:35.108
It was... it was something that she enjoyed.

01:25:35.176 --> 01:25:37.007
He/she went to the war with Paco MejÃ­a,

01:25:37.078 --> 01:25:38.875
who was their assassin years behind.

01:25:38.947 --> 01:25:41.211
It seems to be that it swindled her
and he/she put on for their bill.

01:25:41.282 --> 01:25:43.182
And he/she declared the war to Griselda.

01:25:43.251 --> 01:25:45.617
Official of homicides
they discovered weeks ago

01:25:45.687 --> 01:25:48.850
that a great load
of cocaine valued in millions

01:25:48.923 --> 01:25:51.448
that he/she came from Colombia, never IlegÃ³.

01:25:51.526 --> 01:25:53.858
The police says that he/she went to New York.

01:25:53.928 --> 01:25:57.420
That is one of the things
that he/she didn't forget neither he/she forgave.

01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:01.134
I go to New York to kill all

01:26:01.202 --> 01:26:03.966
those that worked for Paco MejÃ­a.

01:26:05.707 --> 01:26:07.038
It broke all the rules there.

01:26:07.108 --> 01:26:09.303
I spoke with a person that told me:

01:26:09.377 --> 01:26:10.742
"There will be a bathroom of blood."

01:26:10.812 --> 01:26:16.375
Of those that kept the drug,
to the assassins. We kill at 11.

01:26:16.451 --> 01:26:21.218
Eleven people. Mm.
In less than 24 hours.

01:26:21.289 --> 01:26:24.747
They should have been 12,
but I allowed to escape to one.

01:26:24.826 --> 01:26:27.590
The detectives
they are in contact with New York

01:26:27.662 --> 01:26:30.597
to investigate the similarities
among this blow

01:26:30.665 --> 01:26:33.862
in the area of New York
and the murders for drug

01:26:33.935 --> 01:26:35.698
here in Florida of the South.

01:26:35.770 --> 01:26:37.533
The war began.

01:26:39.107 --> 01:26:40.540
Griselda took the first step.

01:26:40.608 --> 01:26:42.701
We are in the commercial center America.

01:26:42.777 --> 01:26:45.405
In 1981 you Ilamaba Bread-American.

01:26:45.480 --> 01:26:47.107
We arrive and I put the cars

01:26:47.182 --> 01:26:48.308
where he/she wanted them.

01:26:48.383 --> 01:26:51.113
This is the scene of the homicide
of Octavio MejÃ­a,

01:26:51.186 --> 01:26:52.414
Paco's father.

01:26:52.487 --> 01:26:56.184
When MejÃ­a left the commercial center...

01:26:56.257 --> 01:26:58.122
Io ambushed.

01:26:58.193 --> 01:27:01.287
They shot him/her several times,
different marksmen.

01:27:01.362 --> 01:27:03.057
A lot of people were angry,

01:27:03.131 --> 01:27:05.793
because he was not part
of the war between Paco and Griselda.

01:27:05.867 --> 01:27:07.732
Many got angry with Griselda.

01:27:07.802 --> 01:27:09.963
It became more enemy, but he didn't care.

01:27:10.038 --> 01:27:11.300
He liked that.

01:27:11.372 --> 01:27:14.307
Not he/she knew that Paco, his son, was there.

01:27:14.375 --> 01:27:17.208
It was in the car
when their father entered to the center.

01:27:17.278 --> 01:27:19.109
It was angry because non Io saw.

01:27:19.180 --> 01:27:20.511
It will catch it otherwise.

01:27:20.582 --> 01:27:22.345
They happened to us the fact that he/she had a house

01:27:22.417 --> 01:27:24.612
in Killian Parkway. Griselda tells me:

01:27:24.686 --> 01:27:26.210
"Not you will wander this time?no?".

01:27:26.287 --> 01:27:27.811
"No, I will fly the house."

01:27:27.889 --> 01:27:29.151
He/she said: ?" What are you saying?".

01:27:29.224 --> 01:27:31.624
"I will put a bomb,
I will kill all", I said.

01:27:31.693 --> 01:27:34.287
I got 200 cartridges of dynamite.

01:27:34.362 --> 01:27:35.954
The explosion was tremendous.

01:27:38.233 --> 01:27:40.997
Him first that it flew it was the roof.

01:27:41.069 --> 01:27:43.037
The house one came below.

01:27:46.207 --> 01:27:47.401
The neighbors wondered

01:27:47.475 --> 01:27:49.943
what it had ruined
the neighborhood's cars.

01:27:50.011 --> 01:27:53.378
The windows were broken.

01:27:53.448 --> 01:27:54.847
He/she wanted to hear the good news

01:27:54.916 --> 01:27:56.611
that they found somebody.

01:27:56.684 --> 01:28:00.586
It turned out to be that I missed it.
The house was empty.

01:28:04.058 --> 01:28:06.185
It was more a skirmish

01:28:06.261 --> 01:28:09.890
in the conflict Griselda Blanco-MejÃ­a.

01:28:09.964 --> 01:28:11.761
Two weeks later, found out

01:28:11.833 --> 01:28:14.063
that Paco MejÃ­a
it was in a flight to Miami

01:28:14.135 --> 01:28:17.366
and it was alone. Griselda says:

01:28:17.438 --> 01:28:18.962
"We will catch it in the airport.

01:28:19.040 --> 01:28:21.804
"You Io will make." Of under the table it takes out

01:28:21.876 --> 01:28:24.709
a bayonet of 40 cm.

01:28:24.779 --> 01:28:26.110
"I want that Io matÃ©s with this."

01:28:26.181 --> 01:28:27.705
He/she wanted that Io stabbed.

01:28:27.782 --> 01:28:30.910
"? What is this?
? Do we change style?", I told him/her.

01:28:30.985 --> 01:28:34.716
They told him/her "the pig"
and he/she wanted him to die as such.

01:28:34.789 --> 01:28:37.417
He/she offered me half million of dollars.

01:28:37.492 --> 01:28:39.460
But he/she had to catch it inside.

01:28:39.527 --> 01:28:41.722
I told him/her that he/she would not enter to the airport.

01:28:41.796 --> 01:28:43.388
"It is a suicide mission.

01:28:43.464 --> 01:28:44.829
"Not I make those things."

01:28:44.899 --> 01:28:46.890
Max Mermelstein and Riverita

01:28:46.968 --> 01:28:49.664
they advised him/her that he/she didn't give that blow.

01:28:49.737 --> 01:28:51.398
Not I will enter to the airport

01:28:51.472 --> 01:28:53.906
to stab him
because I don't want to go to the jail.

01:28:53.975 --> 01:28:55.875
It must be another.
"I already have to other", he/she said.

01:28:55.944 --> 01:28:57.673
He/she told me that he/she was Miguel.

01:28:57.745 --> 01:28:59.110
Miguel PÃ©rez, Miguelito.

01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:01.648
Miguelito was as Rivi, but without class.

01:29:01.716 --> 01:29:04.116
Miguel told me that if the pay was good

01:29:04.185 --> 01:29:05.447
he/she would enter to the White House

01:29:05.520 --> 01:29:06.452
and it would kill the president.

01:29:06.521 --> 01:29:08.318
This picture took it

01:29:08.389 --> 01:29:09.856
soon after of Ilegar

01:29:09.924 --> 01:29:12.188
in 1982 in Mariel.

01:29:12.260 --> 01:29:13.488
It was one of the most fearful types

01:29:13.561 --> 01:29:15.495
that I knew in my career.

01:29:15.563 --> 01:29:17.588
It began them to him
to know as the marielitos

01:29:17.665 --> 01:29:18.893
the intrepid marielitos.

01:29:18.967 --> 01:29:20.264
Physically, it intimidated.

01:29:20.335 --> 01:29:23.361
It was bigger
and he/she had more force than Rivi.

01:29:23.438 --> 01:29:25.770
It is the type class that one thinks

01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:28.172
that it could become crazy suddenly

01:29:28.243 --> 01:29:30.074
and that it could leave the neck.

01:29:30.144 --> 01:29:31.702
I spoke with Miguel and it accepted.

01:29:31.779 --> 01:29:33.371
He/she told me that they would give him/her

01:29:33.448 --> 01:29:36.383
250.000 dollars and a house
to catch it in the airport.

01:29:36.451 --> 01:29:38.180
I told him/her that if he/she entered,

01:29:38.253 --> 01:29:39.550
it won't support it.

01:29:39.621 --> 01:29:42.522
Miguelito didn't care it and single Io made.

01:29:42.590 --> 01:29:43.989
"The only thing that I will make for you,

01:29:44.058 --> 01:29:45.821
"it will be to show you who Paco is."

01:29:45.894 --> 01:29:47.828
They knew in what flight it was,
when it arrived.

01:29:47.896 --> 01:29:50.057
And Io was waiting.

01:29:50.131 --> 01:29:52.258
Well, there Paco came

01:29:52.333 --> 01:29:53.960
and Io last that he/she waited

01:29:54.035 --> 01:29:55.161
it was that a black Io attacked.

01:29:55.236 --> 01:29:57.704
While it left customs

01:29:57.772 --> 01:29:59.603
a man comes closer with a bayonet.

01:29:59.674 --> 01:30:01.574
Miguel comes from behind

01:30:01.643 --> 01:30:03.008
Io grabs with force, Io rises

01:30:03.077 --> 01:30:04.203
and Io knifes.

01:30:04.279 --> 01:30:06.611
It used the bayonet several times.

01:30:06.681 --> 01:30:08.046
I counted 6 or 7 times.

01:30:08.116 --> 01:30:09.708
All in the airport

01:30:09.784 --> 01:30:11.547
they were with the open mouth.

01:30:11.619 --> 01:30:13.951
They were in shock, nobody said anything.

01:30:14.022 --> 01:30:16.422
The ribbon to the floor and he/she leaves running.

01:30:16.491 --> 01:30:18.083
AIlÃ­ began to scream.

01:30:18.159 --> 01:30:20.889
The police ran
until the place of the incident,

01:30:20.962 --> 01:30:23.487
they pointed out them toward where Miguel escaped

01:30:23.564 --> 01:30:26.124
and Io caught at once.

01:30:26.200 --> 01:30:27.895
One of them approaches Miguel,

01:30:27.969 --> 01:30:29.834
that he/she falls to a meter of me

01:30:29.904 --> 01:30:31.963
and Miguel looks at me as requesting help

01:30:32.040 --> 01:30:33.234
with the eyes.

01:30:33.308 --> 01:30:35.173
I denied with the head and I said that not.

01:30:35.243 --> 01:30:36.540
Not he/she could make anything.

01:30:36.611 --> 01:30:39.136
The policemen came from all sides.

01:30:39.213 --> 01:30:42.148
You Io Ilevaron and we leave.

01:30:42.216 --> 01:30:44.081
This was too much, because this place,

01:30:44.152 --> 01:30:46.484
even then, policemen's Ileno was.

01:30:46.554 --> 01:30:48.112
There were policemen in each esplanade.

01:30:48.189 --> 01:30:51.352
To attempt something like that

01:30:51.426 --> 01:30:53.553
it was a madness, and obviously

01:30:53.628 --> 01:30:55.118
it was this way, because Io caught.

01:30:55.196 --> 01:30:57.221
It was this way Miguelito,

01:30:57.298 --> 01:30:59.129
he didn't care it.
He/she had work to make,

01:30:59.200 --> 01:31:00.758
Io that is... to murder,

01:31:00.835 --> 01:31:02.632
and him Io ago.

01:31:02.704 --> 01:31:04.638
But Paco survived,

01:31:04.706 --> 01:31:08.301
and they sentenced Miguel
for murder intent.

01:31:08.376 --> 01:31:10.276
I believe that they gave him/her 15 years.

01:31:10.345 --> 01:31:13.007
The last time that I saw Miguel was.

01:31:13.081 --> 01:31:15.879
I believe that that it was the last exaggeration

01:31:15.950 --> 01:31:19.249
of the war MejÃ­a-Griselda Blanco.

01:31:23.891 --> 01:31:28.692
Griselda Blanco was the catalyst
so that the government

01:31:28.763 --> 01:31:30.560
of EE UU recognized

01:31:30.631 --> 01:31:32.792
that Miami had serious problems,

01:31:32.867 --> 01:31:35.028
that in fact
we were as Dodge City.

01:31:35.103 --> 01:31:36.536
It was outside of control.

01:31:36.604 --> 01:31:39.266
CrÃ©ase or not, when one murders people

01:31:39.340 --> 01:31:41.308
a lot of pressure of it is received.

01:31:41.376 --> 01:31:43.037
You have the hen of the eggs of gold.

01:31:43.111 --> 01:31:44.601
?Why to enter with her?

01:31:44.679 --> 01:31:46.112
Everything was for blame of the violence.

01:31:46.180 --> 01:31:48.114
Not it was for the quantity of drugs,

01:31:48.182 --> 01:31:50.309
they didn't have idea of the quantity that Ilegaba.

01:31:50.385 --> 01:31:51.977
They formed special groups.

01:31:52.053 --> 01:31:54.681
An antidrug group

01:31:54.756 --> 01:31:56.485
well-known as CENTAC 26.

01:31:56.557 --> 01:31:58.149
These types pursued me...

01:31:58.226 --> 01:32:00.956
? Who rays were?
He/she not even knew

01:32:01.029 --> 01:32:02.553
who were.
?From where did they come?

01:32:02.630 --> 01:32:03.824
The district attorneys wait

01:32:03.898 --> 01:32:07.095
to carry out arrests for drugs in the future.

01:32:07.168 --> 01:32:08.328
They had chosen Reagan.

01:32:08.403 --> 01:32:11.065
We need that the president
he/she comes to Dade County

01:32:11.139 --> 01:32:13.369
to speak with the taxi driver's widow

01:32:13.441 --> 01:32:14.738
to the one who you/they flew him/her the head.

01:32:14.809 --> 01:32:16.606
The wars of the cocaine, the violence,

01:32:16.677 --> 01:32:20.238
the homicides, the cover of < i > Tlme, < /i>

01:32:20.314 --> 01:32:21.281
Ilevaron to the action.

01:32:21.349 --> 01:32:23.249
The vice-president's forces Bush

01:32:23.317 --> 01:32:25.046
to combat the crime in Florida of the South

01:32:25.119 --> 01:32:27.053
they flooded federal agents' Miami.

01:32:27.121 --> 01:32:30.056
It is a combined operation with the state,

01:32:30.124 --> 01:32:32.888
the local police,
the coastal watch, the customs.

01:32:32.960 --> 01:32:36.623
Florida of the South is not able to
to be a refuge for the criminals,

01:32:36.697 --> 01:32:40.030
for the organized traffickers of drugs

01:32:40.101 --> 01:32:42.399
neither for the murderers to salary.

01:32:42.470 --> 01:32:43.869
The rest of the country

01:32:43.938 --> 01:32:47.101
bill was giving
that it was not a problem of Miami,

01:32:47.175 --> 01:32:48.836
it was a national problem.

01:32:48.910 --> 01:32:51.970
This initiative will join our resources

01:32:52.046 --> 01:32:56.983
to combat the problem of the drugs
and the crime in Miami.

01:32:57.051 --> 01:32:59.485
I sent him/her a telegram
to the president begging him/her

01:32:59.554 --> 01:33:01.146
that it puts to the Air base Homestead

01:33:01.222 --> 01:33:04.248
in foot of war to intercept, to stop

01:33:04.325 --> 01:33:06.691
and to demolish, of being necessary,

01:33:06.761 --> 01:33:09.389
the airplanes
secret loaded ships

01:33:09.464 --> 01:33:11.557
that they try to enter drug in Florida.

01:33:11.632 --> 01:33:12.963
There is a non identified ship

01:33:13.034 --> 01:33:15.696
to the west of West End, Great Bahama.

01:33:15.770 --> 01:33:18.705
?They can send an airplane
to identify it?

01:33:18.773 --> 01:33:21.435
I received authorization

01:33:21.509 --> 01:33:24.103
of the government from Colombia

01:33:24.178 --> 01:33:27.272
to shoot to their ship.

01:33:27.348 --> 01:33:29.316
Expert, 1-6-0, well.

01:33:33.588 --> 01:33:35.180
Please, stop.

01:33:35.256 --> 01:33:37.622
Tell him/her that he/she stops and Io will make.

01:33:37.692 --> 01:33:39.990
They gave him/her. !Be fume, be fume!

01:33:40.061 --> 01:33:42.495
The agents say
that the tests confirm

01:33:42.563 --> 01:33:45.964
that they have a ton of coca
for value of 31 million dollars,

01:33:46.033 --> 01:33:47.557
1000 millions in the street.

01:33:47.635 --> 01:33:50.297
The quantity of drugs
confiscated in this area

01:33:50.371 --> 01:33:52.771
it ascended to 2500%.

01:33:52.840 --> 01:33:53.966
The net weight is

01:33:54.041 --> 01:33:56.532
of around 1700 kilos.

01:33:56.611 --> 01:33:57.737
It is the biggest seizure

01:33:57.812 --> 01:33:59.439
never carried out by the federal government.

01:33:59.514 --> 01:34:02.745
He/she would say that it is more 4 times
of Io that we never made.

01:34:02.817 --> 01:34:04.409
? He/she means that it is no longer possible

01:34:04.485 --> 01:34:05.850
to enter drugs in EE UU?

01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:07.945
No, we didn't say that.

01:34:08.022 --> 01:34:09.046
? What does he/she mean?

01:34:09.123 --> 01:34:10.249
? What is Io that affirms?

01:34:10.324 --> 01:34:12.485
Every time will be more difficult.

01:34:12.560 --> 01:34:15.085
The good news is that the index of crimes

01:34:15.163 --> 01:34:17.154
low control is.

01:34:17.231 --> 01:34:19.495
There is a commitment to long scale

01:34:19.567 --> 01:34:21.228
on behalf of the citizens, of the government,

01:34:21.302 --> 01:34:22.769
of the police and of the tribunals

01:34:22.837 --> 01:34:25.670
in giving him/her it battles to the enemy.

01:34:28.242 --> 01:34:29.869
!Be quiet, be quiet!

01:34:29.944 --> 01:34:31.707
It was really the principle of the end

01:34:31.779 --> 01:34:34.009
of the era of the Horsemen of the Cocaine.

01:34:34.081 --> 01:34:36.174
The index of murders lowered from 1980.

01:34:36.250 --> 01:34:39.048
There was a drop of 50% in the city

01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:42.612
and of 30% in the outskirts.

01:34:42.690 --> 01:34:44.317
There were too many policemen

01:34:44.392 --> 01:34:46.019
and a lot of pressure in television,

01:34:46.093 --> 01:34:47.185
so I told to Griselda

01:34:47.261 --> 01:34:48.888
that there was a lot of pressure,

01:34:48.963 --> 01:34:50.294
that it would be better to leave vacations.

01:34:50.364 --> 01:34:52.195
He/she told me that he/she planned to transfer

01:34:52.266 --> 01:34:55.394
the operation to California.
"? Do you come with me, Rivi?"

01:34:55.469 --> 01:34:57.528
He/she no longer wanted to continue killing,
he/she had a lot of money.

01:34:57.605 --> 01:34:59.197
He/she Would Return to Chicago.

01:34:59.273 --> 01:35:01.605
In retrospective, we know

01:35:01.676 --> 01:35:04.543
that she left around 1984,

01:35:04.612 --> 01:35:07.672
when the index of homicides
it lowered clearly.

01:35:07.748 --> 01:35:09.181
It was happy of leaving

01:35:09.250 --> 01:35:12.481
because it was conscious
of the pressure to my around,

01:35:12.553 --> 01:35:14.453
and she didn't want to understand it.

01:35:14.522 --> 01:35:16.080
Seeing that the whole organization

01:35:16.157 --> 01:35:19.058
he/she had moved to California

01:35:19.126 --> 01:35:20.593
and that I am an agent in Miami

01:35:20.661 --> 01:35:24.188
I had to convince to my superiors
that it was worthwhile

01:35:24.265 --> 01:35:26.597
that he/she investigated a case in California.

01:35:26.667 --> 01:35:28.191
He/she knew that it was question of time

01:35:28.269 --> 01:35:29.395
before they pursued us.

01:35:29.470 --> 01:35:31.062
I said that if at some time it caught it,

01:35:31.138 --> 01:35:33.629
he/she would give him/her a kiss in the cheek.

01:35:33.808 --> 01:35:35.366
He/she left to California

01:35:35.443 --> 01:35:36.876
and their business began there.

01:35:36.944 --> 01:35:39.879
Rafa didn't want
to send the product until there,

01:35:39.947 --> 01:35:42.211
so she decided
to be made friend of Marta

01:35:42.283 --> 01:35:43.716
to get the cocaine.

01:35:43.784 --> 01:35:45.411
She was family of Ochoa.

01:35:45.486 --> 01:35:47.454
"Not I need Rafa, I can get everything

01:35:47.521 --> 01:35:49.887
"this way." Io made this way.

01:35:49.957 --> 01:35:52.118
Max tells me: "Not there will be

01:35:52.193 --> 01:35:55.060
"coca for a while,
because there are problems.

01:35:55.129 --> 01:35:57.029
"Griselda decided that he/she doesn't want to pay

01:35:57.098 --> 01:35:59.794
"about 1500 kilos or something like that."

01:35:59.867 --> 01:36:02.358
I asked him/her
what he/she had to do with us.

01:36:02.436 --> 01:36:04.996
"Ochoa doesn't want to send anything

01:36:05.072 --> 01:36:07.165
"until everything gets ready."

01:36:07.241 --> 01:36:09.937
Griselda tells me
that he/she wants to kill that dog.

01:36:10.011 --> 01:36:12.445
"?To who?"
And he/she answers: "To this dog."

01:36:12.513 --> 01:36:14.413
Griselda said that if it killed Marta,

01:36:14.482 --> 01:36:15.744
there would not be any test

01:36:15.816 --> 01:36:17.716
of if he/she had given the money to Marta or not

01:36:17.785 --> 01:36:20.049
and of if Marta
non Io had sent to its family.

01:36:20.121 --> 01:36:21.486
I told to Griselda

01:36:21.555 --> 01:36:24.888
if he/she made that, it would finish with their business.

01:36:24.959 --> 01:36:26.859
Not there would be place
in the world where to hide.

01:36:26.927 --> 01:36:28.155
They would look for it for the rest of their life.

01:36:28.229 --> 01:36:29.560
But he/she wanted to make it same.

01:36:29.630 --> 01:36:31.097
I told him/her that it was not necessary.

01:36:31.165 --> 01:36:33.565
It was their exit. "I Will Murder Marta

01:36:33.634 --> 01:36:35.625
"and I will say that I gave him/her the money,

01:36:35.703 --> 01:36:37.227
"and if they ask me,

01:36:37.305 --> 01:36:39.330
"I will tell them that I don't know where
it is because you Io gave to her."

01:36:39.407 --> 01:36:41.375
"Griselda? what will you make?", I told him/her.

01:36:41.442 --> 01:36:43.069
He/she told me: "Murder it."

01:36:43.144 --> 01:36:44.441
As soon as he/she entered and he/she saw Griselda

01:36:44.512 --> 01:36:45.979
you Io made above.

01:36:46.047 --> 01:36:49.016
"Godmother, Godmother,
? what have I made you?"

01:36:49.083 --> 01:36:50.641
Griselda answers: "Anything."

01:36:50.718 --> 01:36:52.686
They kidnapped her,
they murdered it and they found it

01:36:52.753 --> 01:36:54.186
to the side of the highway.

01:37:00.294 --> 01:37:03.559
It was spotted of blood,
you could not kill Marta.

01:37:03.631 --> 01:37:05.531
AIlÃ­ began another war.

01:37:05.599 --> 01:37:07.533
That exploited him/her in the hands.

01:37:07.601 --> 01:37:08.898
All gave him/her the back.

01:37:08.969 --> 01:37:10.664
Even Rafa, their best friend.

01:37:10.738 --> 01:37:12.262
I remember that Rafa and the other ones...

01:37:12.340 --> 01:37:13.705
The other of the poster.

01:37:13.774 --> 01:37:15.742
...they thought of having to kill her.

01:37:15.810 --> 01:37:18.301
There was a price for the head of Griselda.

01:37:18.379 --> 01:37:19.869
They told him/her that where they saw it,

01:37:19.947 --> 01:37:21.881
they will catch it.

01:37:24.418 --> 01:37:25.851
Max entered in problems

01:37:25.920 --> 01:37:27.478
and it was the principle of the end.

01:37:27.555 --> 01:37:29.455
ÃI knew that he/she had a problem.

01:37:29.523 --> 01:37:32.287
Not he/she should have smoked, but Io made.

01:37:32.360 --> 01:37:33.987
Not he/she thought that they would go behind him.

01:37:34.061 --> 01:37:37.053
Max me Ilama and he/she says
that he/she believes that the police Io pursues.

01:37:37.131 --> 01:37:40.225
"I will get myself into the car, I will go for walk,

01:37:40.301 --> 01:37:42.769
"stay in the cellular one with me."

01:37:42.837 --> 01:37:45.305
"Well, Max, I will stay to the telephone."

01:37:45.373 --> 01:37:47.170
Max you gets into the car and he/she leaves.

01:37:47.241 --> 01:37:48.503
It leaves the entrance and he/she tells me

01:37:48.576 --> 01:37:51.340
that they came from all sides.

01:37:51.412 --> 01:37:52.902
I knew that low surveillance was.

01:37:52.980 --> 01:37:55.107
The cars blocked my exit

01:37:55.182 --> 01:37:57.912
and when I realized,
there were 40 weapons aiming me.

01:37:57.985 --> 01:37:59.350
End of the conversation.

01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:02.184
They arrested him and more Io never saw.

01:38:02.256 --> 01:38:03.655
He/she had millions of dollars

01:38:03.724 --> 01:38:05.555
buried in bags in my garden.

01:38:05.626 --> 01:38:07.218
That night I went out with a lantern

01:38:07.294 --> 01:38:10.058
to take out the bags,
because he/she feared that they came.

01:38:10.131 --> 01:38:11.655
He/she lived in the area of Everglades.

01:38:11.732 --> 01:38:13.723
I jumped in a canoe like with...

01:38:13.801 --> 01:38:15.462
I don't know how many...
between 6 and 8 million dollars,

01:38:15.536 --> 01:38:17.060
I threw them in the canoe, I rowed to the other side

01:38:17.138 --> 01:38:19.038
and I buried them
in the National Park of Everglades

01:38:19.106 --> 01:38:20.630
because he/she believed that they came to my house.

01:38:20.708 --> 01:38:22.573
But nobody came neither it passed anything.

01:38:22.643 --> 01:38:24.372
Nobody believed that there would be problems.

01:38:24.445 --> 01:38:25.776
Mickey and the other ones said

01:38:25.846 --> 01:38:27.313
that there were not problems

01:38:27.381 --> 01:38:28.678
with the last airplane that landed

01:38:28.749 --> 01:38:30.080
and that everything seemed to be well.

01:38:30.151 --> 01:38:32.016
I told them that we continued

01:38:32.086 --> 01:38:34.077
until Io discovered.

01:38:34.155 --> 01:38:37.181
Jon said that there was not
I motivate to worry.

01:38:37.258 --> 01:38:39.192
We believed that Jon was very intelligent.

01:38:44.398 --> 01:38:45.365
September 20 1986

01:38:45.433 --> 01:38:47.060
I remember September 20

01:38:47.134 --> 01:38:49.261
because he/she could not sleep.

01:38:49.336 --> 01:38:50.997
That night in particular

01:38:51.071 --> 01:38:52.834
he/she worked with Mickey and their people.

01:38:52.907 --> 01:38:55.603
And because he/she could not sleep, I decided to leave

01:38:55.676 --> 01:38:57.974
to the radio room that we had

01:38:58.045 --> 01:39:00.775
in Miami, to direct to the airplanes.

01:39:00.848 --> 01:39:03.248
They were the regular trips, unique unusual Io

01:39:03.317 --> 01:39:04.648
that we should have noticed,

01:39:04.718 --> 01:39:06.083
it was the silence in the radio

01:39:06.153 --> 01:39:08.621
because they knew that we listened everything.

01:39:08.689 --> 01:39:10.554
I looked around when I left,

01:39:10.624 --> 01:39:12.455
because paranoiac continued for Io of Max,

01:39:12.526 --> 01:39:15.359
and I didn't see he/she swims at all.

01:39:15.429 --> 01:39:18.364
Everything followed their course.

01:39:18.432 --> 01:39:20.957
The airplane landed and I said: Good "other trip,

01:39:21.035 --> 01:39:22.935
"I leave home, I feel well."

01:39:23.003 --> 01:39:24.197
As soon as it landed

01:39:24.271 --> 01:39:25.704
and he/she entered to the barn,

01:39:25.773 --> 01:39:27.968
they appeared in helicopter and people

01:39:28.042 --> 01:39:29.839
it left armed of all sides.

01:39:29.910 --> 01:39:31.810
Lower slowly!the hands in the air!

01:39:31.879 --> 01:39:33.039
!Show my hands!

01:39:33.113 --> 01:39:34.512
I heard a noise,

01:39:34.582 --> 01:39:37.745
it was as if a ray
it had impacted us.

01:39:37.818 --> 01:39:41.015
The types that were
in the airplane they escaped.

01:39:41.088 --> 01:39:42.749
A truck appeared

01:39:42.823 --> 01:39:45.053
to about 100 kms per hour
and they entered for the door.

01:39:45.125 --> 01:39:48.185
It was a simultaneous haul,
Tampa and Miami.

01:39:48.262 --> 01:39:49.957
Dresses arrived of black

01:39:50.030 --> 01:39:52.294
with the masks
and glasses of night vision.

01:39:52.366 --> 01:39:54.630
It seemed that we were
of turn in Vietnam.

01:39:54.702 --> 01:39:56.226
It was a madness.

01:39:56.303 --> 01:39:57.600
I left for the back door.

01:39:57.671 --> 01:39:59.468
"?Do I leave to tirotear with you?"

01:39:59.540 --> 01:40:01.508
I had a confrontation with one of them...

01:40:01.575 --> 01:40:03.668
"!Throw you to the floor and be quiet!"
"Yes, it is well."

01:40:03.744 --> 01:40:05.041
They looked at me,

01:40:05.112 --> 01:40:09.549
and Io will never forget.
"!Roberts! ? What do you make here?"

01:40:09.617 --> 01:40:11.346
I said: Do I "believe that I put the paw?no?".

01:40:11.418 --> 01:40:12.851
"Yes, old.

01:40:12.920 --> 01:40:14.285
"We would have gone later to your house

01:40:14.355 --> 01:40:16.414
"but us Io facilitated."

01:40:16.490 --> 01:40:20.927
"Not he/she could sleep, old."
"What pity", he/she said.

01:40:20.995 --> 01:40:23.793
We arrive at the police station and I heard in the radio

01:40:23.864 --> 01:40:25.889
that there were shootings, and shots.

01:40:25.966 --> 01:40:27.593
"!It is the war!"

01:40:27.668 --> 01:40:29.795
I said: ?" What does it happen?
?Does he/she have to do with me?".

01:40:29.870 --> 01:40:31.770
"It is your airplane, your farm."

01:40:31.839 --> 01:40:33.830
There were shots, shootings.

01:40:33.908 --> 01:40:35.933
They ran for all sides
shooting the weapons.

01:40:36.010 --> 01:40:39.537
"Your friend is shooting us."
Mickey, my friend.

01:40:39.613 --> 01:40:42.081
I was about escaping in the airplane.

01:40:42.149 --> 01:40:44.709
He/she had a gun of flares
and around

01:40:44.785 --> 01:40:46.650
there were tanks of gasoline that we used

01:40:46.720 --> 01:40:48.745
to recharge the tank and to release us.

01:40:48.822 --> 01:40:49.789
I turned one of them.

01:40:49.857 --> 01:40:51.154
Mickey wanted to escape.

01:40:51.225 --> 01:40:52.715
It shot the weapon...

01:40:55.496 --> 01:41:00.297
I left to the swamp.
I saw the show the whole day.

01:41:00.367 --> 01:41:01.891
Not they could find it and Io pursued

01:41:01.969 --> 01:41:03.630
in the forest the whole night.

01:41:03.704 --> 01:41:05.399
These types became crazy.

01:41:05.472 --> 01:41:07.565
This morning, agents of Customs and of the FBI

01:41:07.641 --> 01:41:10.007
they began a haul of 12 people

01:41:10.077 --> 01:41:13.103
that they helped to transport
almost 9100 kilos of cocaine

01:41:13.180 --> 01:41:16.445
toward the country for sea and air
from Colombia.

01:41:16.517 --> 01:41:19.782
One of detainees is the fugitive
Michael Munday.

01:41:19.853 --> 01:41:21.753
The organization Munday
it transported cocaine

01:41:21.822 --> 01:41:23.119
from Colombia

01:41:23.190 --> 01:41:25.124
using airplanes in direct flights.

01:41:25.192 --> 01:41:27.490
An airplane in combination with boats.

01:41:27.561 --> 01:41:31.258
The airplane released the loads in Bahamas.

01:41:31.332 --> 01:41:32.993
Not it was their cocaine, neither they sold

01:41:33.067 --> 01:41:35.661
cocaine in the streets,
alone they transported it

01:41:35.736 --> 01:41:39.069
for another people
and they got paid for the transport.

01:41:39.139 --> 01:41:40.572
A hired service.

01:41:40.641 --> 01:41:42.666
Those loads were held

01:41:42.743 --> 01:41:43.869
to some sophisticated buoys

01:41:43.944 --> 01:41:46.538
that they allowed them to find the drug

01:41:46.614 --> 01:41:48.514
when the authorities were not close.

01:41:48.582 --> 01:41:51.710
This transmits a radio sign

01:41:51.785 --> 01:41:53.412
and it also possesses infrared light

01:41:53.487 --> 01:41:56.979
that it allows them to see them at night.

01:41:57.057 --> 01:41:59.958
This shows advanced Io that were.

01:42:00.027 --> 01:42:01.995
Max Mermelstein transformed into the witness

01:42:02.062 --> 01:42:03.689
that he/she wanted to speak, among other things

01:42:03.764 --> 01:42:04.822
of the murders in Miami.

01:42:04.898 --> 01:42:06.729
We will interrogate to this type...

01:42:06.800 --> 01:42:09.997
and honestly, at the beginning he/she didn't believe him/her

01:42:10.070 --> 01:42:14.370
75% of Io that he/she said,
it was too much disheveled.

01:42:14.441 --> 01:42:15.373
Max was sold.

01:42:15.442 --> 01:42:17.706
He/she gave our back to all.

01:42:17.778 --> 01:42:19.609
And it began to cooperate with them.

01:42:19.680 --> 01:42:22.274
You Io said to Jon,
but he/she didn't believe me neither he/she listened to me.

01:42:22.349 --> 01:42:24.476
From the beginning,
I told them that Max was weak,

01:42:24.551 --> 01:42:26.883
that it would accuse us in some moment

01:42:26.954 --> 01:42:28.444
and it is hence that Io wanted to kill,

01:42:28.522 --> 01:42:29.580
but they didn't leave me.

01:42:29.657 --> 01:42:31.056
The government didn't have idea,

01:42:31.125 --> 01:42:34.026
and if it was not for Max Mermelstein...

01:42:34.094 --> 01:42:36.153
Not I believe that they had caught us.

01:42:36.230 --> 01:42:38.221
It filled the holes.

01:42:38.298 --> 01:42:40.766
Not they knew where the farm was,

01:42:40.834 --> 01:42:43.098
they didn't know anything about the trips.

01:42:43.170 --> 01:42:47.106
Not they knew anything.
He/she made 5 years that we worked.

01:42:47.174 --> 01:42:49.335
Max was of the family.

01:42:49.410 --> 01:42:51.742
I never believed that he/she would make us that.

01:42:51.812 --> 01:42:53.336
They arrived the following day,

01:42:53.414 --> 01:42:56.076
they broke the entrance and they confiscated the house.

01:42:56.150 --> 01:43:00.246
We could confiscate properties
for value of 130 million dollars

01:43:00.320 --> 01:43:01.947
in the area of Florida.

01:43:02.022 --> 01:43:04.456
Thirty five horses Fine Step

01:43:04.525 --> 01:43:07.551
and 14 hectares of ranch
in Marion County, Florida,

01:43:07.628 --> 01:43:09.118
they were also confiscated.

01:43:09.196 --> 01:43:11.130
It left in the cover
of the newspapers the following day

01:43:11.198 --> 01:43:12.756
and he/she had all above me.

01:43:12.833 --> 01:43:14.698
People that wanted to kill me

01:43:14.768 --> 01:43:16.668
because they said that Jon owed them money,

01:43:16.737 --> 01:43:18.364
people that had their money

01:43:18.439 --> 01:43:20.100
and not me Io gave to me.

01:43:20.174 --> 01:43:23.974
Max accused Mickey and me.

01:43:24.044 --> 01:43:27.536
Not he/she could believe it when I read the positions.

01:43:27.614 --> 01:43:28.979
Not I realized that him

01:43:29.049 --> 01:43:31.347
in fact he/she worked for the poster.

01:43:31.418 --> 01:43:32.646
Not he/she knew that Rafa was in the car...

01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:34.085
Not he/she knew anything about that. Not I say

01:43:34.154 --> 01:43:36.554
that he/she didn't know anything.
I say that one didn't realize

01:43:36.623 --> 01:43:39.683
of big Io that was that
in Io that Jon was put.

01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:42.593
You go aboard in a trip
where you make a lot of money

01:43:42.663 --> 01:43:43.789
and you are very powerful,

01:43:43.864 --> 01:43:45.832
for that reason anything... anything will happen.

01:43:45.899 --> 01:43:50.063
I remember the day
that he was sat down on the seat

01:43:50.137 --> 01:43:51.468
Ilorando, because he/she had

01:43:51.538 --> 01:43:53.597
that to leave Io that loved...

01:43:53.674 --> 01:43:57.474
Not I accuse anybody more than to myself.

01:43:57.544 --> 01:43:59.307
You leave when it is moment of leaving.

01:44:01.482 --> 01:44:03.347
He/she spoke with her and he/she told me

01:44:03.417 --> 01:44:04.975
that he was not an informer.

01:44:05.052 --> 01:44:06.542
I told him/her: He/she "works for the police,

01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:08.087
"I won't come closer to you because you will go to the jail.

01:44:08.155 --> 01:44:09.918
But me not."
"They Come to Los Angeles."

01:44:09.990 --> 01:44:12.458
"No, I am well where I am", I told him/her.

01:44:12.526 --> 01:44:16.519
We locate a house that you/they had rented.

01:44:16.597 --> 01:44:18.724
We knew that it was in the house.

01:44:18.799 --> 01:44:21.893
We find it and we enter.

01:44:21.969 --> 01:44:24.028
I ascended and I found it seated in the bed

01:44:24.104 --> 01:44:26.572
reading the Bible. I came closer

01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:28.471
with the gun in the hand.

01:44:28.542 --> 01:44:29.839
It was startled a lot.

01:44:29.910 --> 01:44:33.539
He/she would never believe that it was
a maniac murderess and it forces.

01:44:33.614 --> 01:44:35.081
They arrested her in the house.

01:44:35.149 --> 01:44:37.743
And I kissed her in the cheek,

01:44:37.818 --> 01:44:40.912
as I promised to the agents

01:44:40.988 --> 01:44:43.616
many months before.

01:44:43.690 --> 01:44:46.454
The police believes that it is responsible

01:44:46.527 --> 01:44:49.325
of at least 200 murders...

01:44:49.396 --> 01:44:52.832
in one period of more 10 years
of wars for drugs.

01:44:52.900 --> 01:44:55.334
Today, an arrest that could demolish

01:44:55.402 --> 01:44:58.200
to one of the figures
more notorious criminals from Florida.

01:44:58.272 --> 01:45:00.035
Then they arrested their children.

01:45:00.107 --> 01:45:01.836
Everything one came below seriously.

01:45:01.909 --> 01:45:03.934
Now I take care to myself.

01:45:04.011 --> 01:45:05.103
All are in the jail less me.

01:45:05.179 --> 01:45:06.703
And they are looking for me.

01:45:06.780 --> 01:45:08.839
For that then, him and their siblings

01:45:08.916 --> 01:45:11.441
they were in the airport
in a stolen car.

01:45:11.518 --> 01:45:13.679
It stops them the police

01:45:13.754 --> 01:45:16.222
and they resist to the arrest.
They had cocaine

01:45:16.290 --> 01:45:19.225
and they put them low it guards.

01:45:19.293 --> 01:45:21.420
I am low it guards from then on.

01:45:24.264 --> 01:45:27.097
With the time, the market of the drug

01:45:27.167 --> 01:45:29.795
it was disarticulated by the police.

01:45:29.870 --> 01:45:32.805
Much of that money
let us say that it disappeared,

01:45:32.873 --> 01:45:36.172
and while it was judged,
it sentenced and he/she sent to prison

01:45:36.243 --> 01:45:39.735
to the drug dealers, something happened.

01:45:39.813 --> 01:45:42.941
The businesses
that they frequented and they supported

01:45:43.016 --> 01:45:44.984
they began to melt and to close.

01:45:45.052 --> 01:45:47.213
The bank Sunshine State
it is outside of career.

01:45:47.287 --> 01:45:48.515
It is alleged that Sunshine State

01:45:48.589 --> 01:45:50.716
it was bought with the laundry
of money of the drugs.

01:45:50.791 --> 01:45:53.259
All the night clubs melted,

01:45:53.327 --> 01:45:56.125
the concessionaires
they left to the bankruptcy,

01:45:56.196 --> 01:45:57.754
the jeweler'ses.

01:45:57.831 --> 01:46:00.629
The real estate businesses
they are decaying.

01:46:00.701 --> 01:46:02.032
That type of businesses

01:46:02.102 --> 01:46:04.229
it has suffered too much.

01:46:04.304 --> 01:46:08.172
Those crashes
they created new opportunities.

01:46:08.242 --> 01:46:10.233
The economy of Miami stayed

01:46:10.310 --> 01:46:14.838
with the speculators that won
money with the business of the drugs.

01:46:14.915 --> 01:46:17.349
If you had a concessionaire
whose sales were

01:46:17.417 --> 01:46:19.544
of 20 millions to 60 millions for anus

01:46:19.620 --> 01:46:22.111
during ten years, there you have

01:46:22.189 --> 01:46:24.487
500 millions extra
that they are giving turns.

01:46:24.558 --> 01:46:27.288
Not it would have been there

01:46:27.361 --> 01:46:28.692
if you didn't have the horrors

01:46:28.762 --> 01:46:31.322
of the Horsemen of the Cocaine.

01:46:31.398 --> 01:46:33.093
The drugs destroy to the community

01:46:33.166 --> 01:46:35.225
when it is fought with the street.

01:46:35.302 --> 01:46:38.066
When we speak from drugs to the level

01:46:38.138 --> 01:46:39.901
that the main drug dealers

01:46:39.973 --> 01:46:43.170
they live, they go of vacations
and they buy houses here,

01:46:43.243 --> 01:46:44.938
washing the money, etc.,

01:46:45.012 --> 01:46:48.072
that improves the economy
of a city or community.

01:46:48.148 --> 01:46:52.608
Much of that money
he/she went privately to infrastructures.

01:46:53.420 --> 01:46:55.115
Constructions for the value
of 2300 million dollars

01:46:55.188 --> 01:46:57.520
you Ilevan to end in the center of Miami.

01:46:57.591 --> 01:46:59.422
The general construction

01:46:59.493 --> 01:47:00.983
in the center and in Brickell.

01:47:01.061 --> 01:47:02.824
The authorities of the center

01:47:02.896 --> 01:47:05.387
they say that more constructions
for 1000 million dollars

01:47:05.465 --> 01:47:08.400
you IlevarÃ¡n to end
in the next ones 6 to 8 months.

01:47:08.468 --> 01:47:10.959
Uf, built half of the city.

01:47:11.038 --> 01:47:13.199
It built the towers,
the sky-scrapers.

01:47:13.273 --> 01:47:14.638
They say that the boom of the construction

01:47:14.708 --> 01:47:16.938
it will last the next 10 years.

01:47:17.010 --> 01:47:19.069
The drug traffic
it saved Miami in many ways.

01:47:19.146 --> 01:47:21.876
If you look to the buildings,
many of them

01:47:21.949 --> 01:47:25.612
they were built
or they were paid with money of drugs.

01:47:25.686 --> 01:47:27.313
These new constructions represent

01:47:27.387 --> 01:47:31.483
25.000 new works
and annual wages for millions.

01:47:31.558 --> 01:47:33.890
The new condominiums,
offices and banks

01:47:33.961 --> 01:47:36.122
they will add about 20 millions
of more dollars

01:47:36.196 --> 01:47:38.460
to the base of taxes of Miami.

01:47:38.532 --> 01:47:41.763
While the cocaine entered Miami

01:47:41.835 --> 01:47:44.497
and the millions of dollars

01:47:44.571 --> 01:47:47.267
they entered in Latin America,
legitimate Miami

01:47:47.341 --> 01:47:50.435
he/she realized that it was
the entrance to the rest of America.

01:47:50.510 --> 01:47:54.105
The traffic of drugs
it put to Miami in the map.

01:47:54.181 --> 01:47:58.049
<i > Newsweek < /i > IlamÃ³ to Miami
Casablanca of America.

01:47:58.118 --> 01:48:00.484
What contrast with Io of 7 years behind.

01:48:00.554 --> 01:48:02.579
A thing about the terrible publicity

01:48:02.656 --> 01:48:05.557
it is that there was much.
All spoke of Miami.

01:48:05.625 --> 01:48:06.717
- Miami.
- Miami.

01:48:06.793 --> 01:48:08.260
- Miami.
- To Miami Beach.

01:48:08.328 --> 01:48:09.556
- The whole world.
- People said:

01:48:09.629 --> 01:48:11.153
"I always wanted to go to Miami,

01:48:11.231 --> 01:48:13.096
"?seriously it is this way? The beaches that I see

01:48:13.166 --> 01:48:15.361
"and the beautiful women
and the night" clubs.

01:48:15.435 --> 01:48:18.461
It Is the Club 1235.
It is the place where

01:48:18.538 --> 01:48:21.132
he/she took place the great party
of < i > Mlaml Vlce < /i > on Saturday.

01:48:21.208 --> 01:48:24.200
We were in television
every Friday

01:48:24.277 --> 01:48:25.642
with < i > Mlaml Vlce.

01:48:25.712 --> 01:48:30.809
The histories were based
entirely in the drug traffic.

01:48:30.884 --> 01:48:33.352
He/she can that < i > Mlaml Vlce < /i > he/she doesn't help
to improve the image of the city,

01:48:33.420 --> 01:48:36.321
but he/she makes a lot for the local economy.

01:48:36.390 --> 01:48:41.225
Don Johnson and < i > Mlaml Vlce, < /i>
To Pacino in < i > Caracortada.

01:48:41.294 --> 01:48:42.727
It was very attractive.

01:48:42.796 --> 01:48:45.424
This is Miami, everything is more relaxed.

01:48:45.499 --> 01:48:47.865
It was interesting
because when the series came out

01:48:47.934 --> 01:48:51.233
they found an abandoned hotel

01:48:51.304 --> 01:48:53.101
or a gas station in the beach,

01:48:53.173 --> 01:48:54.572
they put lights, they painted them,

01:48:54.641 --> 01:48:56.108
they fixed them, they renovated them,

01:48:56.176 --> 01:48:57.473
they recorded the scenes there

01:48:57.544 --> 01:49:00.536
and they left a renovated place behind.

01:49:00.614 --> 01:49:02.138
I believe that they made that a lot of people

01:49:02.215 --> 01:49:05.150
he/she saw the possibilities that there was.

01:49:26.873 --> 01:49:28.568
At the end of the 80 and principles of the 90

01:49:28.642 --> 01:49:33.807
the European industry of the fashion
South discovered Beach,

01:49:33.880 --> 01:49:35.370
and behind the models

01:49:35.449 --> 01:49:37.474
the European rich visitors come

01:49:37.551 --> 01:49:39.075
that they pursued the models.

01:49:39.152 --> 01:49:41.643
And we finish receiving to the famous ones.

01:49:41.721 --> 01:49:44.383
He/she reminds me to the city Greenwich in 1965

01:49:44.458 --> 01:49:47.052
because it is in fashion and it is new.

01:49:47.127 --> 01:49:49.061
Then Ilegaron the paparazzi

01:49:49.129 --> 01:49:50.756
and they created a phenomenon.

01:49:50.831 --> 01:49:54.824
It passed of being a place vacacional

01:49:54.901 --> 01:50:00.100
to be the international capital
prosperous of America.

01:50:00.173 --> 01:50:04.735
The world began
to converge to Miami and Io we get.

01:50:04.811 --> 01:50:06.210
We could have reborned

01:50:06.279 --> 01:50:08.213
without so much people died.

01:50:08.281 --> 01:50:10.181
He/she could have lived without it.

01:50:10.250 --> 01:50:11.581
And a lot of people could live

01:50:11.651 --> 01:50:15.087
without the enormous contribution
of money to the community.

01:50:15.155 --> 01:50:17.123
There were colateral too many effects.

01:50:17.190 --> 01:50:20.057
Not I believe that the economic benefits

01:50:20.127 --> 01:50:23.722
they were worth the cost in the society.

01:50:23.797 --> 01:50:27.096
I still love more Miami, but the master

01:50:27.167 --> 01:50:29.829
by Io that was
before the war of the cocaine.

01:50:29.903 --> 01:50:32.167
? What price was it paid by a sky-scraper?

01:50:32.239 --> 01:50:36.801
? How much people he/she had to die
for those buildings?

01:50:36.877 --> 01:50:39.937
Not it was worthwhile,
too many died hence.

01:50:40.013 --> 01:50:44.074
Honestly, Miami
it would not be where it is today

01:50:44.151 --> 01:50:45.448
without having lived the horrors

01:50:45.519 --> 01:50:47.453
and tragedies of those years.

01:50:47.521 --> 01:50:50.957
Today people delight speaking

01:50:51.024 --> 01:50:55.017
of how they survived
in Miami in 70 80.

01:50:57.097 --> 01:50:58.724
I returned because he/she had to make it.

01:50:58.798 --> 01:51:00.459
Not he/she had option.

01:51:00.834 --> 01:51:03.029
Jon Roberts left the federal prison
in October of 2000

01:51:03.103 --> 01:51:06.038
It Returned to Florida
as condition of their conditional freedom

01:51:06.573 --> 01:51:08.268
I will never forget when I left,

01:51:08.341 --> 01:51:10.070
I went to a hotel in South Beach

01:51:10.143 --> 01:51:12.077
Ilamado The Surfcomber.
The first tomorrow

01:51:12.145 --> 01:51:14.079
I got up and I went to the beach.

01:51:14.147 --> 01:51:16.707
It was recumbent and a girl leaves the water

01:51:16.783 --> 01:51:17.841
and while it leaves

01:51:17.918 --> 01:51:19.613
I see that he/she doesn't have the part of up.

01:51:19.686 --> 01:51:20.778
They have to understand

01:51:20.854 --> 01:51:22.651
that he/she made 11 years that it was in prison.

01:51:22.722 --> 01:51:24.155
He/she looked at that naked girl

01:51:24.224 --> 01:51:25.885
and non Io could believe, I got scared.

01:51:25.959 --> 01:51:28.427
I ran to the hotel and I could not leave

01:51:28.495 --> 01:51:31.225
of the room during one day.
"? What did it happen?"

01:51:31.298 --> 01:51:33.596
The world had changed.

01:51:33.667 --> 01:51:38.263
The city had grown a lot
in those 12 years.

01:51:39.039 --> 01:51:41.234
Mickey Munday was a fugitive
during 6 years

01:51:41.308 --> 01:51:43.003
until it was arrested by the police
in 1992.

01:51:43.076 --> 01:51:45.670
It left prison in December of 1999.

01:51:46.546 --> 01:51:48.343
Non Io knows, the times change.

01:51:48.415 --> 01:51:51.646
In that time,
we didn't care anything.

01:51:51.718 --> 01:51:52.980
Miami was an open city,

01:51:53.053 --> 01:51:54.247
totally different.

01:51:54.321 --> 01:51:57.256
If you requested me that it killed to such and which

01:51:57.324 --> 01:51:59.189
alone you should point out it

01:51:59.259 --> 01:52:00.521
and me Io murdered.

01:52:00.594 --> 01:52:02.084
It is no longer open,

01:52:02.162 --> 01:52:03.129
it is a different city.

01:52:03.196 --> 01:52:04.561
Today could not make it.

01:52:04.631 --> 01:52:06.895
He/she would make it in a completely different way.

01:52:06.967 --> 01:52:09.629
It is a very different city
to the one that the memory.

01:52:24.417 --> 01:52:26.317
Many of my acquaintances

01:52:26.386 --> 01:52:27.614
they are no longer here.

01:52:27.687 --> 01:52:29.154
The friends with those that I grew

01:52:29.222 --> 01:52:31.656
they are dead. They killed them.

01:52:32.125 --> 01:52:33.854
Rafa Cardona Salazar
it was murdered to shots

01:52:33.927 --> 01:52:38.626
in MedellÃ­n, Colombia,
December 7 1987.

01:52:38.698 --> 01:52:41.258
Soon after of their arrest
in June of 1985,

01:52:41.334 --> 01:52:43.461
Max Mermeistein entered in the Program
Federal of Witnesses' Protection.

01:52:43.536 --> 01:52:47.267
Their testimony was in the accusation
of the leaders of the poster of MedellÃ­n.

01:52:48.041 --> 01:52:49.702
The whereabouts of Mermeistein
it continues being an incognito one

01:52:49.776 --> 01:52:51.971
and it continues working as witness
remunerated for the government of EE UU.

01:52:52.045 --> 01:52:54.878
According to some reports,
he/she has a contract of 3 million dollars.

01:52:55.649 --> 01:52:57.139
Griselda Blanco and Jorge "Rivi" Ayala

01:52:57.217 --> 01:52:59.549
they were accused of the murder of
Johnny Castro and Alfredo and Grizel Lorenzo.

01:52:59.619 --> 01:53:01.985
Rivi avoided the death penalty

01:53:02.055 --> 01:53:03.716
consenting to testify against their boss,
Griselda Blanco.

01:53:04.824 --> 01:53:07.588
I Went to Miami,
I declared myself guilty of two murders.

01:53:07.661 --> 01:53:10.596
Life imprisonment to be
fulfilled simultaneously.

01:53:10.664 --> 01:53:12.655
I am here from then on.

01:53:12.732 --> 01:53:16.099
As a result
of the information given by Rivi,

01:53:16.169 --> 01:53:17.261
there were 14 different homicides

01:53:17.337 --> 01:53:18.929
attributed
to the organization of Griselda Blanco.

01:53:19.005 --> 01:53:21.235
When it occurred turn and he/she began to sing

01:53:21.308 --> 01:53:22.798
on all the homicides

01:53:22.876 --> 01:53:25.310
and how she had ordered them,
it was completed.

01:53:25.378 --> 01:53:27.369
She was our John Gotti,

01:53:27.447 --> 01:53:30.712
and Rivi their "Sammy The Bull" Gravano.

01:53:32.686 --> 01:53:34.916
The case against Griselda Blanco

01:53:34.988 --> 01:53:37.286
it turned out to be a frustration.

01:53:37.357 --> 01:53:39.154
Terribly disappointing and useless.

01:53:39.225 --> 01:53:42.922
It was declared guilty
of insignificant positions.

01:53:42.996 --> 01:53:45.760
We were escaped. I believed that we had it.

01:53:45.832 --> 01:53:48.266
What happened was shameful.

01:53:48.601 --> 01:53:51.297
Rivi was involved in a scandal
sexual very publicitado

01:53:51.371 --> 01:53:52.929
with secretaries of the office
of the attorney of the state of Miami Dade.

01:53:53.006 --> 01:53:55.167
Humiliated, the attorney did without of him
as witness against Griselda

01:53:55.241 --> 01:53:57.266
and he/she offered him/her a sentence
agreed of conformity.

01:53:57.377 --> 01:53:59.641
When we lost Rivi,
we lost the connection

01:53:59.713 --> 01:54:02.079
between the assassins and Griselda.

01:54:02.148 --> 01:54:05.413
Riverita helped to create
the case and to destroy it.

01:54:05.485 --> 01:54:08.477
One of the investigations bombarded

01:54:08.555 --> 01:54:12.047
of more significant homicides
that they were made.

01:54:12.125 --> 01:54:14.559
During their terror reign,

01:54:14.627 --> 01:54:19.496
she made many enemies
here and in Colombia,

01:54:19.566 --> 01:54:21.193
and they have not forgotten it.

01:54:21.267 --> 01:54:23.565
Certainly not Io forgot with concerning

01:54:23.636 --> 01:54:25.536
to Uber and Osvaldo.

01:54:25.605 --> 01:54:27.266
The children of Griselda,
Uber and Osvaldo,

01:54:27.340 --> 01:54:30.070
they were murdered with machine guns
in Colombia.

01:54:30.677 --> 01:54:31.974
The proverb "who kills to iron,

01:54:32.045 --> 01:54:34.070
to iron he/she dies" it is very certain

01:54:34.147 --> 01:54:36.172
in the business in the one that you/they are.

01:54:36.249 --> 01:54:39.844
It is probable that if he/she returned to Colombia,

01:54:39.919 --> 01:54:42.410
it would suffer the same luck.

01:54:42.489 --> 01:54:43.820
Not there is nobody that deserves

01:54:43.890 --> 01:54:44.982
the death penalty more than her.

01:54:45.058 --> 01:54:46.457
It should be sentenced to death.

01:54:46.526 --> 01:54:49.359
He/she gives me some comfort the fact

01:54:49.429 --> 01:54:52.455
that it will be in prison
until the day in that I retire.

01:54:52.532 --> 01:54:53.499
Not I know how much more,

01:54:53.566 --> 01:54:55.727
but it will be in prison

01:54:55.802 --> 01:54:57.326
while it is police.

01:55:03.510 --> 01:55:05.478
The sergeant To Singleton retired
of the police body of Miami-Dade

01:55:05.545 --> 01:55:07.342
June 30 2003.

01:55:07.414 --> 01:55:12.613
Griselda Blanco left the jail
June 6 2004.

01:55:13.420 --> 01:55:16.617
The same day that left, they stabbed Rivi
in a jail of Miami.

01:55:16.689 --> 01:55:21.922
He/she survived, but he/she refused
to identify their attacker.

01:55:21.995 --> 01:55:26.659
June 7 2004,
Griselda was deported Colombia.

01:55:28.468 --> 01:55:35.032
Their whereabouts is ignored.

01:55:45.718 --> 01:55:47.743
When I moved to Florida
it was in Orlando,

01:55:47.821 --> 01:55:49.448
in Disney World, with my children

01:55:49.522 --> 01:55:50.750
and he/she spoke with people from Germany.

01:55:50.824 --> 01:55:53.156
"My God, they are from Miami."

01:55:53.226 --> 01:55:54.523
"? What does he/she have of bad Miami?"

01:55:54.594 --> 01:55:56.459
"Skies, murder people every day.

01:55:56.529 --> 01:55:57.894
"We look at the news in Europe."

01:55:57.964 --> 01:56:00.125
I said: "Yes, yes, it is a dangerous" city.

01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:02.225
"Not I will go there of vacations."

01:56:02.302 --> 01:56:03.963
My wife looked at me...

01:56:04.037 --> 01:56:06.198
if they knew.

01:56:06.272 --> 01:56:07.899
What wanted to know was

01:56:07.974 --> 01:56:09.703
what it happened with all the money.

01:56:13.413 --> 01:56:15.005
The invasion happened before the dawn,

01:56:15.081 --> 01:56:16.241
when airplanes of EE UU

01:56:16.316 --> 01:56:18.614
they bombarded the barracks
of General Noriega.

01:56:18.685 --> 01:56:20.016
It used their position

01:56:20.086 --> 01:56:23.078
to sell Panama to the traffickers.

01:56:23.156 --> 01:56:24.350
When Noriega fell

01:56:24.424 --> 01:56:25.914
we lost through the bank of Panama

01:56:25.992 --> 01:56:29.223
about 140 millions among Max, me,

01:56:29.295 --> 01:56:32.731
Rafa, Ochoa, Escobar,
all lost a part.

01:56:32.799 --> 01:56:34.733
It was this way like we lost a lot.

01:56:34.801 --> 01:56:36.063
It was then in the jail

01:56:36.135 --> 01:56:38.433
and there was not way to retire the money.

01:56:38.505 --> 01:56:40.439
The government you Io IlevÃ³ everything.

01:56:40.507 --> 01:56:41.872
You Ilevaron all the money.

01:56:42.842 --> 01:56:44.139
We went to the cinema

01:56:44.210 --> 01:56:45.905
and we lined up during two hours to see

01:56:45.979 --> 01:56:48.106
the famous movie < i > Caracortada, < /i>

01:56:48.181 --> 01:56:51.708
me and other nine types, the ten assassins.

01:56:51.784 --> 01:56:53.149
The movie begins

01:56:53.219 --> 01:56:54.516
and they try to kill him.

01:56:54.587 --> 01:56:56.646
They bring to two Colombians to murder it

01:56:56.723 --> 01:56:58.486
and we begin to laugh.

01:56:59.692 --> 01:57:00.784
Us Io had killed.

01:57:00.860 --> 01:57:03.420
If it happened in the real life,

01:57:03.496 --> 01:57:04.861
Io would have murdered.

01:57:06.900 --> 01:57:08.993
February 3 2006,

01:57:09.068 --> 01:57:10.660
the lawyer Samuel L. Burstyn

01:57:10.737 --> 01:57:12.796
it was declared
guilty of obstruction to the justice

01:57:12.872 --> 01:57:13.839
after their arrest

01:57:13.907 --> 01:57:16.501
in their house in Sunset Island,
valued in 4,8 million dollars.

01:57:16.576 --> 01:57:18.339
The district attorneys said
that it acted as lawyer

01:57:18.411 --> 01:57:19.503
for a criminal organization

01:57:19.579 --> 01:57:20.876
that it cared and it distributed

01:57:20.947 --> 01:57:22.244
cocaine and marijuana.

01:57:22.315 --> 01:57:24.146
Burstyn faces 20 years prison .

01:57:24.217 --> 01:57:27.084
If it is guilty of all the positions,
it will be prisoner 42 months,

01:57:27.153 --> 01:57:28.814
he will find difficult their license and it will lose

01:57:28.888 --> 01:57:31.914
400.000 dollars cash and in active.
