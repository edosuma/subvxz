WEBVTT

00:00.130 --> 00:02.132
Will Chase... FBI!

00:05.144 --> 00:07.044
Frankie Trowbridge... CIA.

00:07.047 --> 00:09.414
The world is in chaos.

00:09.417 --> 00:10.616
So I've assembled

00:10.619 --> 00:12.859
all of America's best
intelligence assets

00:12.862 --> 00:13.927
under one banner.

00:13.930 --> 00:15.589
We are all officially working together.

00:15.591 --> 00:16.623
As a team.

00:16.625 --> 00:18.692
- Led by me.
- Led by me.

00:18.694 --> 00:20.627
Previously on "Whiskey Cavalier"...

00:20.629 --> 00:21.862
Do you think she misses me?

00:21.864 --> 00:23.945
What did we decide about your feelings?

00:23.948 --> 00:25.732
I have my feelings.

00:25.735 --> 00:27.421
My feelings don't have me.

00:27.424 --> 00:29.136
I was leaving this girl's apartment,

00:29.138 --> 00:30.871
and I got a little turned around.

00:30.873 --> 00:32.706
Was she worth me almost getting killed?

00:34.243 --> 00:35.776
Nope.

00:36.747 --> 00:37.880
Hey, Ray.

00:37.883 --> 00:38.882
Will?

00:38.885 --> 00:41.119
Did we, uh, interrupt something?

00:41.971 --> 00:43.138
William.

00:43.141 --> 00:44.797
Were you coming from
her new place that day?!

00:44.799 --> 00:46.148
The day I got shot?!

00:46.151 --> 00:47.417
- Hey!
- What?!

00:47.420 --> 00:49.023
- You said it wasn't my fault.
- Aah!

00:49.026 --> 00:52.093
Why do you always have to
be such a damn Boy Scout?

01:00.776 --> 01:02.676
Will, if you need anything,

01:02.679 --> 01:05.312
please call me any time of day or night.

01:05.315 --> 01:06.849
I think I'm gonna need
another piece of this strudel.

01:06.851 --> 01:08.703
- It is incredible.
- Ah!

01:08.706 --> 01:11.226
See, honey, this is why
I wanted to Airbnb...

01:11.229 --> 01:12.937
- Feel like a local.
- Mm-hmm.

01:12.940 --> 01:13.940
You sure you don't want another bite?

01:13.942 --> 01:15.275
- I'm good.
- All right.

01:15.278 --> 01:16.310
Missing out.

01:16.313 --> 01:18.046
Ohh!

01:18.049 --> 01:21.000
- I'm glad you like the strudel.
- Mm. Mmm!

01:21.003 --> 01:23.958
You know, this is an old
recipe from my grandmother.

01:23.960 --> 01:26.781
When I was a child, I
was a real naschkatze.

01:27.218 --> 01:29.094
_

01:29.097 --> 01:30.631
You speak German?

01:31.117 --> 01:32.298
_

01:32.301 --> 01:34.318
My grandfather taught it
to me, but I love using it.

01:34.320 --> 01:36.270
Debbie... she doesn't
understand a word of it.

01:37.703 --> 01:40.242
_

01:40.245 --> 01:42.019
_

01:42.311 --> 01:44.076
_

01:45.181 --> 01:46.731
- Auf Wiedersehen.
- Auf Wiedersehen.

01:47.628 --> 01:49.495
Oh! She's the best, don't you think?

01:50.081 --> 01:51.281
I'm not tense.

01:51.284 --> 01:53.015
Hey, her words, not mine.

01:53.018 --> 01:55.155
Look, Stavros is gonna
be here any minute,

01:55.158 --> 01:57.258
and I don't want to miss our target

01:57.260 --> 02:00.294
because you were too busy
making eyes at Frau Strudel.

02:00.296 --> 02:02.676
Okay, first of all, stop
hitting me with rifle parts.

02:02.679 --> 02:03.765
It's rude.

02:03.767 --> 02:05.216
Second, it's called polite conversation.

02:05.218 --> 02:06.768
- It's what non-robots do.
- Hmm.

02:06.770 --> 02:09.503
And, for future reference,
any time anyone ever offers me

02:09.506 --> 02:11.031
an authentic Bavarian dessert...

02:11.033 --> 02:14.040
Strudel, streusel,
marzipan, Black Forest cake,

02:14.043 --> 02:15.843
carrot cake... That's Bavarian...

02:15.845 --> 02:17.545
Dampfnudel... Oh, come on.

02:17.547 --> 02:19.013
I'm just not turning that down.

02:27.414 --> 02:33.628
_

02:33.630 --> 02:34.829
All right, I'm in position.

02:36.833 --> 02:38.182
Let's run the play.

02:38.185 --> 02:39.503
Stavros Pappas.

02:39.506 --> 02:41.768
Greek shipping magnate. At
least, that's his day job.

02:41.771 --> 02:43.638
In his off time, he
moonlights as a smuggler

02:43.640 --> 02:45.306
for the world's criminal elite.

02:45.308 --> 02:47.141
Word has just come out
that he keeps a ledger

02:47.143 --> 02:50.065
of all his illegal
transactions and his customers.

02:50.068 --> 02:52.246
It's a Who's Who of
the world's most wanted.

02:52.248 --> 02:54.882
That ledger will help us
dismantle criminal networks,

02:54.884 --> 02:56.651
take down terrorist cells...

02:56.653 --> 02:58.553
The possibilities are endless.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.187
The problem is, the
ledger is kept in a vault

03:01.190 --> 03:04.091
that can only be accessed
via Stavros' retinal scan,

03:04.093 --> 03:06.294
which means we got to grab Stavros...

03:06.296 --> 03:08.086
Alive, Frankie...

03:09.299 --> 03:10.426
...and get him to open the vault

03:10.428 --> 03:11.566
so we can get our hands on the ledger

03:11.568 --> 03:13.533
and put a lot of bad people behind bars.

03:13.536 --> 03:16.204
And then, time for beer and strudel.

03:21.544 --> 03:23.945
Heads up. Convoy is en route.

03:23.947 --> 03:26.214
Okay. Deploying MAV.

03:26.216 --> 03:28.049
Oh, it's cute!

03:30.000 --> 03:36.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:38.261 --> 03:40.728
Jai's playing with his little toy car.

03:40.730 --> 03:43.831
This is a custom-built
Miniature Assault Vehicle.

03:43.833 --> 03:45.533
It is not a toy car.

03:49.972 --> 03:52.006
Okay, fine. It's a toy car.

03:52.008 --> 03:54.909
Okay, guys, as soon as I
disable this lead vehicle,

03:54.911 --> 03:57.144
Stavros' security team is gonna react.

03:57.146 --> 03:58.746
On it.

03:58.748 --> 03:59.914
Once they are in range,

03:59.916 --> 04:01.427
I can hack the vehicle's RFID chip,

04:01.430 --> 04:03.062
basically putting me behind the wheel.

04:03.065 --> 04:05.586
From there, I can adjust the mirrors,

04:05.588 --> 04:07.765
roll down the windows, change the radio.

04:07.768 --> 04:09.190
Just lock the doors, Standish.

04:09.192 --> 04:10.159
Yeah, sure.

04:10.162 --> 04:12.092
Four years at MIT,
three years at the NSA,

04:12.095 --> 04:15.198
and I have been reduced to
"Lock the door, Standish."

04:16.164 --> 04:18.565
Locking protocol standing by.

04:20.101 --> 04:22.768
It's showtime, people. Follow my lead.

04:22.771 --> 04:24.218
Or follow our lead,

04:24.221 --> 04:26.484
'cause, again... Co-captains.

04:26.487 --> 04:28.142
Got the convoy.

04:42.692 --> 04:44.042
I'm sorry.

04:44.045 --> 04:46.294
I'm afraid that you're locked
in your bulletproof car.

04:46.296 --> 04:50.097
Upside, though... Fantastic acoustics.

04:51.601 --> 04:53.834

04:54.871 --> 04:56.122

04:56.125 --> 04:58.291
Jai, Susan... all yours.

05:01.878 --> 05:03.077
Okay.

05:10.286 --> 05:11.586
Hot box.

05:15.123 --> 05:18.392
Get out of the car! Out of the car now!

05:18.394 --> 05:20.428
Hands! You... let's go.

05:20.430 --> 05:21.762
Stavros, hands up.

05:21.764 --> 05:23.093
I want to see those hands.

05:23.096 --> 05:24.565
- Susan?
- I got him. I got him.

05:24.568 --> 05:26.729
Slowly. I want to see those hands.

05:33.308 --> 05:35.843
Go! Move, move, move!

05:47.422 --> 05:49.090
He's getting away.

05:55.130 --> 05:57.164
Aah!

06:06.341 --> 06:07.799
Who the hell was that?

06:07.802 --> 06:09.191
I was gonna ask you the same question.

06:09.193 --> 06:10.678
I don't know every assassin.

06:10.680 --> 06:11.946
I like her hair, though.

06:11.948 --> 06:13.881
Great. Way to focus on what's important.

06:13.883 --> 06:15.814
I bet someone found out
their name was in that ledger

06:15.816 --> 06:17.150
and they sent our new
friend to kill Stavros.

06:17.152 --> 06:18.484
Yeah, we should leave now, maybe.

06:18.487 --> 06:19.909
We still need to get his retinal scan.

06:19.911 --> 06:21.355
No, no, no. Scene's too hot.

06:22.797 --> 06:24.992
I got a better idea. All
right, let's get out of here.

06:24.994 --> 06:26.493
I'll drive.

06:59.661 --> 07:02.630
Mm. You smell nice.

07:02.632 --> 07:03.998
Citrus?

07:04.000 --> 07:05.866
Lemon verbena.

07:05.868 --> 07:07.902
It's the body wash
from the hotel in Rome.

07:07.904 --> 07:09.136
I stole a bunch.

07:09.138 --> 07:11.739
Can I give you some free advice?

07:12.607 --> 07:14.608
No.

07:14.610 --> 07:16.777
You're too nice.

07:17.679 --> 07:18.746
Weird burn.

07:18.748 --> 07:20.848
I mean for a spy.

07:20.850 --> 07:22.750
You're too emotionally available.

07:22.752 --> 07:24.184
I'm sorry.

07:24.186 --> 07:25.784
I couldn't hear you
over the wall of mistrust

07:25.786 --> 07:27.521
that you've built around yourself.

07:27.523 --> 07:28.989
It's so big.

07:30.426 --> 07:32.526
You guys are supposed to be a dead body,

07:32.528 --> 07:33.872
so will you please shut up?

07:33.875 --> 07:35.033
Right. Sorry.

07:35.036 --> 07:36.463
Sorry.

07:36.465 --> 07:38.065
Your fault.

07:41.570 --> 07:43.203
Hey, hey.

07:44.786 --> 07:45.804
_

07:45.807 --> 07:48.075
Hello, gentlemen.

07:48.077 --> 07:49.658
Just here to drop off this body.

07:49.661 --> 07:51.211
Guy died of hemorrhagic fever.

07:51.213 --> 07:52.622
All of his organs liquefied.

07:52.632 --> 07:53.895
Like, everything...

07:53.898 --> 07:56.682
He's just one big water balloon
full of disease at this point.

07:56.685 --> 07:59.987
You can actually feel the virus
coming off of him like steam.

07:59.989 --> 08:01.155
Like, it's hot.

08:01.157 --> 08:02.756
It's warm, toasty. Come here.

08:02.758 --> 08:04.425
You should feel it. Feel it!

08:04.427 --> 08:05.459
Nah, danke.

08:05.461 --> 08:06.994
No? You sure?

08:07.003 --> 08:09.494
So, what, you want me
to just leave him here

08:09.497 --> 08:11.665
or take him in there for you?

08:16.238 --> 08:18.372
Standish, I know it's
an asset for the team,

08:18.374 --> 08:20.874
but the enthusiasm with
which you are able to lie

08:20.876 --> 08:22.709
is at an almost sociopathic level.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.711
Thank you!

08:29.685 --> 08:31.452
All right, we good.

08:35.524 --> 08:36.722
What's that smell?

08:36.725 --> 08:37.724
Dead bodies.

08:37.726 --> 08:39.293
Eh, and citrus.

08:39.294 --> 08:41.361
All right. Let's find Stavros.

08:45.177 --> 08:46.433
Ah. Found him.

08:52.173 --> 08:53.640
Thanks for your help.

08:53.642 --> 08:54.720
I'm doing things.

08:54.723 --> 08:56.176
Sure.

08:59.215 --> 09:01.215
Don't think he really
cares how you look.

09:01.217 --> 09:02.683
No, it's a retinal scanner Jai made.

09:02.685 --> 09:03.684
Oh.

09:03.686 --> 09:05.686
Here we go.

09:08.691 --> 09:10.057
How exactly does it work?

09:10.059 --> 09:11.925
It scans the retina.

09:13.828 --> 09:14.995
Wait. Look.

09:14.997 --> 09:16.280
Guys, you have company.

09:16.283 --> 09:17.549
The blonde who shot Stavros

09:17.552 --> 09:19.633
with a team of three, heavily armed.

09:20.922 --> 09:22.503
All right, how long
until the scan's complete?

09:22.505 --> 09:23.629
Five minutes.

09:23.632 --> 09:25.439
Too long.

09:32.847 --> 09:34.162
Guys, you better hurry.

09:35.718 --> 09:37.918
Finish this.

09:37.920 --> 09:39.720
Okay, so, what do we do now?

09:39.722 --> 09:40.954
Shortcut.

09:40.956 --> 09:42.516
Shortcut? What do you mean "shortcut"?

09:44.101 --> 09:45.225
Hello?

09:45.227 --> 09:46.727
What do you mean "shortcut"?

09:46.729 --> 09:47.694
Oh!

09:47.696 --> 09:48.962
It's... Oh, God!

09:48.964 --> 09:51.498
That's what "shortcut" means. Okay!

09:51.500 --> 09:53.133
You are deep in there.

09:53.135 --> 09:54.723
I almost got it.

09:57.006 --> 09:59.020
Don't just stand there. Get a bag.

09:59.023 --> 10:01.008
No, this will be all
right. I'll swallow it.

10:01.943 --> 10:03.944
Oh, you mean for the... Yeah, okay.

10:03.946 --> 10:05.512
Hey, guys, let's hurry it up.

10:05.514 --> 10:08.215
Okay. All right.

10:10.385 --> 10:12.052
Catch.

10:12.054 --> 10:13.754
Aah, ha!

10:13.756 --> 10:15.622
Ugh!

10:15.624 --> 10:18.507
We can't let them get that other eye.

10:19.356 --> 10:21.590
Don't worry. I took care of it.

10:25.562 --> 10:27.096
Go, go, go!

10:33.882 --> 10:35.148
Grenade!

10:52.481 --> 10:55.028
Good evening, Whiskey.
Welcome back to New York.

10:55.031 --> 10:58.302
I hope your team is enjoying
your new working arrangements.

10:58.305 --> 11:00.805
A bunch of friends who go in on
a bar that's never gonna open?

11:00.807 --> 11:02.340
It's the perfect cover, sir.

11:02.342 --> 11:03.762
Actually...

11:03.765 --> 11:06.551
some of us are, uh... Are
really leaning into it.

11:09.349 --> 11:10.782
Watch out. That's heavy.

11:11.550 --> 11:13.970
Now, I'm in surgery
all day tomorrow, but...

11:13.973 --> 11:15.520
I can definitely give you a call

11:15.522 --> 11:17.489
on Tuesday once I scrub out.

11:17.491 --> 11:19.457
So you're an orthopedic surgeon?

11:19.459 --> 11:21.348
I mean, when I'm not powerlifting.

11:21.351 --> 11:23.184
It's actually how I
meet most of my patients.

11:23.187 --> 11:24.662
Can't wait to hear more about it.

11:24.664 --> 11:26.931
Mm. Can't wait to tell you about it.

11:28.001 --> 11:31.095
So, you not only use
your lying for good.

11:31.098 --> 11:33.238
You use it for evil, too.

11:33.240 --> 11:34.489
You're disappointed in me.

11:34.492 --> 11:35.567
No.

11:35.570 --> 11:37.107
But she will be when she finds out

11:37.110 --> 11:39.144
you're not a powerlifting surgeon.

11:39.979 --> 11:41.379
I'm sorry. I was saving her number.

11:41.381 --> 11:42.547
What was that?

11:42.549 --> 11:44.349
Hey, guys, it's Director Casey.

11:44.351 --> 11:45.750
Good news, team.

11:45.752 --> 11:47.512
We found the location of the ledger.

11:47.515 --> 11:49.120
You're going to the Czech Republic...

11:49.122 --> 11:50.522
Prague, to be exact.

11:50.524 --> 11:51.623
Great. We'll saddle up.

11:51.625 --> 11:53.191
Slight complication.

11:53.193 --> 11:55.360
It turns out we need two retinal scans

11:55.362 --> 11:56.715
to open the vault.

11:56.718 --> 11:57.928
Stavros is one.

11:57.931 --> 12:00.689
His widow, Karen, is the other.

12:00.692 --> 12:03.845
She has no knowledge of her
husband's criminal empire.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.671
She's been separated from
Stavros for some time.

12:06.673 --> 12:08.772
We need you to get her retinal scan

12:08.775 --> 12:11.470
and secure that ledger
before that other team does.

12:11.473 --> 12:12.865
All right, based on our
blond friend in Vienna,

12:12.867 --> 12:14.846
we'll have to move fast. Any
update on who she might be?

12:14.848 --> 12:17.081
Working on it. You'll
be the first to know.

12:17.083 --> 12:18.716
Okay. Thank you, sir.

12:18.718 --> 12:20.151
Oh, one more thing.

12:20.153 --> 12:22.387
I have no interest in
being kept up to date

12:22.389 --> 12:25.089
on the day-to-day illicit
activities of your team.

12:25.091 --> 12:27.692
That's the type of thing
that could end a career.

12:27.694 --> 12:30.978
So I'm assigning you someone
to lay out your missions,

12:30.981 --> 12:32.363
act as a liaison,

12:32.365 --> 12:35.165
and basically serve as support
wherever you are in the world.

12:35.168 --> 12:36.595
Sounds like a horrible job.

12:36.598 --> 12:37.622
It is.

12:37.625 --> 12:40.004
That's why we had trouble
finding a candidate.

12:40.006 --> 12:41.892
I've sent him over to say hello.

12:41.895 --> 12:42.997
Okay, great. Thank you.

12:44.475 --> 12:46.475
Knock, knock.

12:48.581 --> 12:51.249
Uh, guess who got a promotion.

12:53.519 --> 12:56.220
Hey, guys.

12:56.222 --> 12:57.455
Ray's here.

12:57.457 --> 12:58.856
How you doing, Ray?

12:58.858 --> 13:00.491
Pretty good, actually.

13:00.493 --> 13:01.893
Uh they gave me a medal.

13:01.895 --> 13:03.661
For what? All you did was get shot.

13:03.663 --> 13:05.196
Oh, it was for taking down Ollerman.

13:05.198 --> 13:06.597
I mean, true,

13:06.599 --> 13:08.661
I was kind of unconscious
when it happened,

13:08.664 --> 13:10.864
but since you guys
technically don't exist

13:10.867 --> 13:12.600
they gave the medal to me.

13:15.008 --> 13:17.675
But I'm not proud of it.

13:17.677 --> 13:20.345
Will, I'm not proud of
a lot of stuff I've done.

13:20.347 --> 13:22.580
But being your friend

13:22.582 --> 13:24.148
was kind of the highlight of my life,

13:24.150 --> 13:28.119
and I-I'd do anything to get that back.

13:28.121 --> 13:31.789
That's why I'm so excited
to be part of this team.

13:31.791 --> 13:34.233
- Mm.
- You're not part of this team, Ray.

13:34.236 --> 13:36.369
Yeah, Susan makes a great point.

13:36.372 --> 13:38.463
I've got to earn that,
and I plan on earning it

13:38.465 --> 13:40.465
with each and every one of you.

13:41.735 --> 13:43.301
- I missed you, buddy.
- Wait.

13:44.003 --> 13:45.658
Ooh-kay. Too soon?

13:45.661 --> 13:46.904
All right, we'll get there.

13:46.906 --> 13:48.340
All right.

13:48.343 --> 13:50.275
If any of the team needs me,

13:50.278 --> 13:52.143
this teammate is there for the team.

13:52.145 --> 13:53.978
Team player.

13:55.481 --> 13:57.181
So we're good?

13:57.183 --> 14:01.395
I know I've got work to do.

14:02.531 --> 14:04.554
I can't believe you
two got so twisted up

14:04.557 --> 14:06.257
over a girl half your age.

14:06.259 --> 14:08.059
Gigi wasn't half my age.

14:08.061 --> 14:09.460
She was gonna be 30...

14:09.462 --> 14:10.695
at some point.

14:10.697 --> 14:13.664
Okay, well, I need you to stay focused.

14:13.666 --> 14:15.500
We can't let this affect the mission.

14:15.502 --> 14:16.768
What? I'm fine!

14:16.770 --> 14:19.971
He is fine. He's great, in fact, right?

14:19.973 --> 14:21.572
I've never seen you better.

14:21.574 --> 14:23.508
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you.

14:24.276 --> 14:25.510
Are you okay?

14:28.581 --> 14:30.848
All right. This is the
Imperial Bank in Prague.

14:30.850 --> 14:32.656
Vault is located inside.

14:32.659 --> 14:35.126
The question is, how do we
get the widow's retinal scan?

14:35.129 --> 14:38.923
What if we just asked her, but nicely?

14:38.925 --> 14:40.391
No, because she could lawyer up,

14:40.393 --> 14:41.859
or worse... Panic and disappear.

14:41.861 --> 14:43.394
With another team chasing this ledger,

14:43.396 --> 14:44.462
we have to move fast.

14:44.464 --> 14:45.563
Hey.

14:45.565 --> 14:46.934
How about a honeytrap?

14:46.937 --> 14:47.969
Honey what, now?

14:47.972 --> 14:49.599
It's basically when you seduce someone

14:49.602 --> 14:51.169
to get them to give you what you want.

14:51.171 --> 14:52.203
Uh, I don't know.

14:52.206 --> 14:53.790
Seduce a woman whose husband just died?

14:53.793 --> 14:55.653
- I don't like it.
- Yeah, that's wrong.

14:55.656 --> 14:57.474
This is her, by the way.

14:57.477 --> 14:59.012
Karen Pappas.

15:01.747 --> 15:05.249
Well, Casey did say they were estranged.

15:05.251 --> 15:07.418
Yeah. Yeah, I got this.

15:10.622 --> 15:11.956
You don't think I can do this?

15:11.958 --> 15:13.691
Do I think that Mr. Feelings

15:13.693 --> 15:15.960
can seduce and deceive
a vulnerable woman?

15:15.962 --> 15:18.496
I think I have a better
chance of it than you do.

15:18.498 --> 15:20.498
Look. I can do this.

15:20.500 --> 15:22.867
- Okay.
- Tell her, Susan.

15:24.833 --> 15:25.903
Susan?

15:27.093 --> 15:29.774
Estranged or not, this woman
did just lose her husband,

15:29.776 --> 15:31.098
and she's gonna be hurting,

15:31.101 --> 15:33.122
and I think that's gonna
be hard for you to ignore.

15:33.125 --> 15:34.946
Hey, now, come on!

15:34.948 --> 15:37.181
Look at this guy.

15:37.183 --> 15:38.416
Puppy-dog eyes.

15:38.418 --> 15:39.917
Nice, full lips.

15:39.919 --> 15:41.752
Karen's gonna get one
look at my man here,

15:41.754 --> 15:43.254
and he gonna be scanning

15:43.256 --> 15:45.623
a lot more than the retinas, right?

15:45.626 --> 15:46.932
I can't... I can't high-five that.

15:46.934 --> 15:48.593
But I appreciate the support.

15:48.595 --> 15:50.212
There's just no way you can handle it.

15:50.215 --> 15:51.629
You, uh...

15:51.631 --> 15:53.397
I don't know... you care
to make this interesting?

15:53.399 --> 15:54.866
I don't know.

15:54.868 --> 15:57.335
If you fail, Blondie with
the good hair gets the ledger

15:57.337 --> 15:58.769
and a ton of criminals walk,

15:58.772 --> 16:00.362
so I kind of feel like
it already is interesting.

16:00.364 --> 16:01.506
Still, five bucks.

16:01.508 --> 16:02.840
Okay.

16:02.842 --> 16:04.942
Or you want to just give
it to me now and save time?

16:06.312 --> 16:08.546
No.

16:11.140 --> 16:14.129
_

16:22.495 --> 16:24.022
Eyes on target...

16:24.025 --> 16:26.025
Leaving her apartment, heading north.

16:26.028 --> 16:27.832
Okay. I have a visual.

16:27.834 --> 16:30.768
Well-dressed, black-on-black.

16:30.770 --> 16:33.571
In mourning, but still chic.

16:33.573 --> 16:34.739
I like her.

16:34.741 --> 16:36.352
Will, remember, she has a PhD

16:36.355 --> 16:38.088
in Eastern European Literature.

16:38.091 --> 16:39.224
That's your way in.

16:39.227 --> 16:40.759
Shoot your shot, dawg.

16:40.762 --> 16:42.346
Yeah, I got her.

16:42.348 --> 16:43.915
I'm moving in.

16:46.185 --> 16:47.251
- Oh!
- Oh!

16:47.253 --> 16:48.286
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

16:48.289 --> 16:49.490
No, it's my fault.

16:49.493 --> 16:52.060
I got my head buried in
this map like I'm a...

16:52.063 --> 16:53.457
Well, like I'm a tourist.

16:54.460 --> 16:55.526
You speak English.

16:55.528 --> 16:56.736
Hey, I'm Pete Hewson.

16:56.739 --> 16:57.995
Uh, Karen Pappas.

16:57.997 --> 16:59.567
Hey, Karen, it's nice to meet you.

16:59.570 --> 17:00.932
Look, I've done more than
enough to bother you for the day,

17:00.934 --> 17:02.166
but if you could just point me

17:02.168 --> 17:03.643
in the direction of the Charles Bridge,

17:03.645 --> 17:05.469
I'd appreciate it.

17:05.471 --> 17:08.205
It's... right behind you.

17:08.208 --> 17:11.493
The old "I didn't see the big
cultural landmark behind me" move.

17:11.497 --> 17:12.710
Classic.

17:12.712 --> 17:14.278
Come on. I'm walking
that way. I'll show you.

17:14.280 --> 17:17.281
- Oh, I'd love that. Thank you.
- Yeah.

17:19.385 --> 17:20.829
So, you're a professor.

17:20.833 --> 17:22.212
University of Newfoundland.

17:22.214 --> 17:24.121
Uh, New U, as we call it.

17:24.123 --> 17:25.095
Go, Hawks!

17:25.098 --> 17:26.626
Okay.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.275
But I'm doing a six-month sabbatical

17:28.278 --> 17:30.595
here in Prague, teaching
Eastern European Literature.

17:30.597 --> 17:31.929
So if you ever want to get crazy

17:31.931 --> 17:34.031
and discuss the poetry of Viktor Dyk...

17:34.033 --> 17:36.236
Viktor Dick, dependi...
Dick/Dyk... it's, uh...

17:36.239 --> 17:37.602
It's dealer's choice, really.

17:37.604 --> 17:41.239
Uh, but I'm your man. You know, so...

17:41.241 --> 17:42.567
It's Dyk.

17:42.661 --> 17:43.908
It's Dyk.

17:45.211 --> 17:46.310
Put us on "mute."

17:47.112 --> 17:48.846
- He's blowing this.
- I don't know.

17:48.848 --> 17:51.382
Maybe he's trying to
get her to pity him.

17:51.384 --> 17:52.617
I know I do.

17:52.619 --> 17:54.658
Guys, we got to keep his confidence up.

17:54.661 --> 17:56.934
Agreed. Unmute.

17:56.937 --> 17:58.555
Will, you're blowing it.

17:58.558 --> 18:00.191
Even Susan agrees.

18:00.193 --> 18:03.027
Hey, man, quick question...

18:03.029 --> 18:05.263
You ever spoken to a woman before?

18:05.265 --> 18:06.530
These are pretty, aren't they?

18:06.532 --> 18:07.751
They're... They're big.

18:07.754 --> 18:09.200
Okay, new plan.

18:09.202 --> 18:11.869
I want you to listen to me
and do exactly as I tell you.

18:11.871 --> 18:14.775
Look into her eyes and
say, "But enough about me."

18:14.778 --> 18:16.107
But enough about me.

18:16.109 --> 18:19.110
I want to know about you,
and not the usual stuff.

18:19.112 --> 18:22.313
I can tell you're smart,
strong, and beautiful.

18:22.315 --> 18:25.549
Tell me something that
nobody knows about Karen.

18:28.220 --> 18:30.087
Okay.

18:30.089 --> 18:31.822
Um...

18:31.824 --> 18:34.692
Behind us, there is a lady

18:34.694 --> 18:37.561
walking a Jack Russell
on a yellow leash,

18:37.563 --> 18:40.564
Slavic Steve Buscemi,

18:40.566 --> 18:44.168
and Burgundy Bilbo Baggins.

18:45.538 --> 18:47.705
Burgundy Bilbo Baggins.
I would've said...

18:47.707 --> 18:50.708
eh, a little Vladimir Putin,
but I see Bilbo Baggins.

18:50.710 --> 18:52.814
I can see Putin. I can...
I'll give you Putin.

18:52.817 --> 18:54.178
How do you do that?

18:54.180 --> 18:55.978
Uh, photographic memory.

18:55.981 --> 18:59.116
I can see something once
and it's... it's just there.

18:59.118 --> 19:00.584
Photographic memory.

19:00.586 --> 19:01.719
That's amazing.

19:01.721 --> 19:02.787
It's a neat trick.

19:02.789 --> 19:04.697
It's not really useful in real life.

19:04.700 --> 19:06.587
Unless a stranger

19:06.590 --> 19:09.160
asks to know something about
you that no one else knows.

19:09.162 --> 19:10.828
Perfect.

19:10.830 --> 19:13.830
Now shoot her that smile you
think is so charming and say...

19:13.833 --> 19:15.433
Strangers, huh?

19:15.435 --> 19:16.467
Well...

19:16.469 --> 19:17.902
Well, how about we, uh...

19:17.904 --> 19:19.837
How about we change
that over dinner tonight?

19:21.106 --> 19:22.473
I'd like that.

19:22.475 --> 19:23.595
I like her.

19:23.598 --> 19:25.076
She has low standards.

19:25.078 --> 19:28.145
Okay, take her to...

19:28.147 --> 19:29.680
Kampa Park... 8:00?

19:29.682 --> 19:32.150
I will see you there.

19:32.153 --> 19:33.718
I'll see you there.

19:33.720 --> 19:35.353
- Oh!
- Oh, we're going the same way.

19:35.355 --> 19:36.854
- Wow. That's hard....
- Uh, you go first, please.

19:36.856 --> 19:37.818
...'cause it was so good.

19:37.820 --> 19:39.090
I know it was a good... Go ahead.

19:39.092 --> 19:40.124
Um, I am gonna go.

19:40.126 --> 19:41.158
Yeah, there's stuff I have to see.

19:41.160 --> 19:42.460
Sure, see things.

19:42.462 --> 19:44.662
Nice going, Will.

19:44.664 --> 19:46.813
Because he did exactly
as I told him to do.

19:46.816 --> 19:47.915
He brought it home.

19:47.918 --> 19:49.867
I still got it, people.

19:49.869 --> 19:50.901
Yeah!

19:51.804 --> 19:53.338
Oh. Who saw that?

19:53.341 --> 19:54.206
Nobody?

19:54.209 --> 19:56.137
You saw that. All right.

19:57.988 --> 20:01.189
_

20:01.192 --> 20:03.526
How handsome are you?

20:03.529 --> 20:05.329
Stop.

20:06.566 --> 20:09.400
All right, not only are
these just beautiful,

20:09.402 --> 20:11.235
each one has a shot of
compressed etorphine.

20:11.237 --> 20:14.988
What you do... get Karen alone,
gently caress her cheek...

20:14.991 --> 20:16.307
Mm, soft...

20:16.310 --> 20:18.165
Then touch your wrist, gas comes out.

20:18.168 --> 20:20.011
She's out like a light. Okay?

20:20.013 --> 20:21.312
Yeah, what about the retinal scanner?

20:21.314 --> 20:23.071
Lip gloss... Same one Frankie used.

20:23.074 --> 20:25.149
I'm a man. I can't carry lip gloss.

20:25.151 --> 20:27.118
Uh, let's call it lip balm.

20:27.120 --> 20:29.184
- Let's call it lip balm.
- All right.

20:29.187 --> 20:30.888
Okay, here's how you seal the deal.

20:30.890 --> 20:33.004
- You tell her you miss your dog.
- Oh, God.

20:33.007 --> 20:34.959
- Pretty sure I got this, Standish.
- Shh!

20:34.961 --> 20:36.394
You miss your dog.

20:36.396 --> 20:38.473
Now, girls love it when
dogs have human names.

20:38.476 --> 20:39.897
What, like Bill?

20:39.899 --> 20:41.176
Bill, Derek, whatever...

20:41.179 --> 20:43.767
The point is, he's a rescue,
and that's gonna get you laid.

20:43.770 --> 20:45.069
What is wrong with you?

20:45.071 --> 20:46.871
I don't know. I get too much play?

20:46.873 --> 20:48.005
Yeah.

20:48.007 --> 20:49.012
- No.
- No.

20:49.015 --> 20:50.629
This is classic overcompensation.

20:50.632 --> 20:53.110
Anyone who says that
they get "too much play"

20:53.112 --> 20:55.179
almost certainly gets no play at all.

20:55.181 --> 20:56.847
Okay, you don't even know.

20:56.849 --> 20:58.549
Trust me. She knows.

20:59.723 --> 21:01.754
How far do you really
get with these women

21:01.757 --> 21:03.420
before your stories start to unravel?

21:03.423 --> 21:04.668
Two dates? Three?

21:04.671 --> 21:06.457
I'm not really looking for
anything serious right now.

21:06.459 --> 21:07.224
Well, that's good.

21:07.227 --> 21:09.434
Because as long as you
keep slinging the B.S.,

21:09.437 --> 21:11.037
you're never gonna get it.

21:13.166 --> 21:14.200
Look.

21:14.203 --> 21:15.802
My life's been kind of rough.

21:15.805 --> 21:17.601
My mom left when I was 8,

21:17.603 --> 21:21.637
and I guess telling these
women I'm a surgeon or a lawyer

21:21.640 --> 21:22.973
makes me feel a little bit less

21:22.975 --> 21:26.243
like the kid that nobody wanted.

21:26.245 --> 21:27.344
I'm sorry.

21:27.346 --> 21:29.513
I had no idea.

21:29.515 --> 21:34.251
It's not really something I
share with a lot of people.

21:34.253 --> 21:35.853
All right. How do I look?

21:35.855 --> 21:39.223
Like a man totally incapable
of lying to a vulnerable woman.

21:40.082 --> 21:41.225
Susan?

21:41.227 --> 21:43.060
Ignore her. You are ready.

21:43.062 --> 21:44.395
Yeah.

21:44.398 --> 21:46.296
Hey, guys. The team.

21:46.299 --> 21:48.699
What's up? What are we talking about?

21:48.701 --> 21:50.345
Will, lookin' strong.

21:50.348 --> 21:51.836
What are you doing here, Ray?

21:51.838 --> 21:54.171
Oh, I come bearing
essential information.

21:54.173 --> 21:56.707
Know that blonde you thought
you blew up at the morgue?

21:56.709 --> 21:58.676
Well, turns out she survived.

21:58.678 --> 22:00.311
Check it out.

22:00.313 --> 22:02.379
Already got a name... Hana Novak.

22:02.381 --> 22:03.481
Topflight mercenary.

22:03.483 --> 22:07.351
Employer unknown,
but... I'm working on it.

22:07.353 --> 22:09.462
You might not be totally
useless after all.

22:09.465 --> 22:12.890
Oh, and the cherry on
top... Kentucky's finest.

22:12.892 --> 22:14.291
Your favorite, buddy.

22:14.293 --> 22:16.676
All part of my kick-ass,
four-part apology.

22:16.679 --> 22:18.095
- Ray, I don't want...
- Nope.

22:18.097 --> 22:19.697
Now, don't ask me how much it cost,

22:19.699 --> 22:22.766
'cause you can't put
a price on friendship.

22:24.002 --> 22:25.736
$900!

22:25.738 --> 22:27.471
Well, I was wrong.

22:27.473 --> 22:28.973
Get out.

22:28.976 --> 22:30.007
Good point.

22:30.009 --> 22:31.242
We all got a lot to do,

22:31.244 --> 22:34.745
and I've got... important... business.

22:34.747 --> 22:36.514
This shouldn't be here.

22:36.516 --> 22:37.515
No, I know.

22:37.517 --> 22:38.649
I'm-a drink this for you.

22:38.651 --> 22:40.451
And I'm gonna help you.

22:44.257 --> 22:45.689
Forget Ray.

22:45.691 --> 22:47.016
You're gonna kill it tonight

22:47.019 --> 22:48.151
because you...

22:48.154 --> 22:49.261
are awesome.

22:49.264 --> 22:50.895
- Look at that smile.
- Yeah.

22:50.897 --> 22:53.063
- Stop it.
- Come on.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.268
Yeah, I'm awesome.

23:06.712 --> 23:08.212
Thank you very much.

23:10.682 --> 23:12.516
I'm in position, awaiting the target.

23:12.518 --> 23:13.984
And I feel amazing.

23:13.986 --> 23:15.286
You should feel amazing.

23:15.288 --> 23:17.959
You were dressed by
a brave Indian genius.

23:17.962 --> 23:19.389
Now, that person's a hero.

23:19.392 --> 23:21.959
Yeah, you look like
if all the James Bonds

23:21.961 --> 23:23.327
had an orgy baby

23:23.329 --> 23:25.362
and then that baby grew up to be you.

23:25.364 --> 23:26.797
Not even sure how that would work,

23:26.799 --> 23:28.571
but thank you... I think.

23:28.574 --> 23:31.193
We should've sent Standish.
He can lie about anything.

23:31.196 --> 23:33.100
- Thank you.
- Well, cut him some slack.

23:33.103 --> 23:37.041
Yes, he has issues, but his
mom left him when he was a kid.

23:37.043 --> 23:38.375
That's so sad.

23:38.377 --> 23:40.978
- Is that what he told you?
- Yeah.

23:40.980 --> 23:43.540
He lives... with his mom.

23:44.761 --> 23:47.028
Just don't read hand cues, do you?

23:47.031 --> 23:48.085
My bad.

23:48.087 --> 23:49.119
I will murder you.

23:49.121 --> 23:51.121
That's justified.

23:51.123 --> 23:52.956
So, you excited about your date?

23:52.958 --> 23:54.992
It's not a date, Frankie.

23:54.994 --> 23:56.860
It's a target. A job.

24:10.743 --> 24:11.881
Hey.

24:11.884 --> 24:12.943
Hi.

24:12.945 --> 24:14.011
Good to see you.

24:14.013 --> 24:15.346
It's nice to see you.

24:15.348 --> 24:17.047
I'm... I'm so sorry if I made you wait.

24:17.049 --> 24:18.382
No, please, sit down.

24:18.384 --> 24:19.616
How embarrassing.

24:19.618 --> 24:20.784
No, no, I just got here.

24:20.786 --> 24:23.020
Are you... okay?

24:23.022 --> 24:25.022
It's just been a day. I'm good.

24:25.024 --> 24:26.957
You look like you've been crying.

24:28.220 --> 24:30.828
It's over. He can't handle emotion.

24:30.830 --> 24:32.062
No, you are wrong.

24:32.064 --> 24:33.615
Real emotion is his specialty.

24:33.618 --> 24:34.765
He can do this.

24:34.767 --> 24:36.373
Will, you can do this.

24:36.376 --> 24:37.701
I believe in you.

24:37.703 --> 24:39.503
Peter...

24:42.208 --> 24:44.775
My husband just died.

24:44.777 --> 24:47.444
Oh, Karen, I-I had no idea.

24:47.446 --> 24:49.313
I'm so sorry.

24:49.315 --> 24:51.849
I'm not.

24:51.851 --> 24:53.283
Look, I know that sounds terrible,

24:53.285 --> 24:58.789
but we had not been close
for... for years, and...

24:58.791 --> 25:01.258
now I think the thing that
I feel most guilty about

25:01.260 --> 25:04.962
is that I don't feel sad.

25:04.964 --> 25:08.665
Now here I am on a date,

25:08.667 --> 25:09.867
which only confirms the fact

25:09.869 --> 25:11.490
that I am a truly terrible person.

25:11.493 --> 25:13.604
No, you're not a terrible person.

25:13.606 --> 25:17.236
You're not. You're just in a
really vulnerable place right now.

25:17.239 --> 25:18.605
And I get it.

25:20.612 --> 25:22.813
I guess I can, uh...

25:22.815 --> 25:23.928
I can share this with you.

25:23.931 --> 25:25.816
I recently found out

25:25.818 --> 25:28.252
that my girlfriend was cheating on me

25:28.254 --> 25:30.954
with, uh... With my best friend.

25:33.024 --> 25:36.226
And that really messed me up.

25:36.228 --> 25:39.296
Peter, that's horrible.

25:39.298 --> 25:40.931
I'm so sorry.

25:40.933 --> 25:44.101
Look, we can't control our feelings.

25:44.103 --> 25:46.217
We just fight as hard as we can

25:46.220 --> 25:49.373
to make sure our feelings
aren't controlling us.

25:50.775 --> 25:53.201
I knew he wasn't fine!
What the hell is he doing?!

25:53.204 --> 25:55.245
He is being himself.

25:55.247 --> 25:56.880
- Girls love that.
- You're a wise man.

25:58.117 --> 25:59.316
Yeah.

26:01.454 --> 26:02.653
Thank you.

26:02.655 --> 26:04.655
Sure, yeah.

26:04.657 --> 26:05.889
I am so sorry.

26:05.891 --> 26:08.042
I have totally ruined our dinner.

26:08.045 --> 26:09.593
No, you have not. Not at all.

26:09.595 --> 26:11.028
You know, um...

26:11.030 --> 26:13.263
You know what you do
on a night like this?

26:13.265 --> 26:14.965
No.

26:15.934 --> 26:17.968
Well, you eat dessert first.

26:20.606 --> 26:21.905
How's that sound?

26:21.907 --> 26:23.407
Who says no to dessert?

26:23.410 --> 26:25.198
I may be out five bucks.

26:26.145 --> 26:27.277
- Yeah?
- I'm in.

26:27.279 --> 26:28.412
Ray?

26:28.414 --> 26:32.064
Oh, hey. Um... Czech officials just, uh,

26:32.067 --> 26:34.567
got a hit for Hana
Novak on a traffic cam.

26:35.820 --> 26:37.521
Think she's in Prague.

26:40.080 --> 26:41.914
Will, do you copy?

26:41.917 --> 26:43.417
He took his comms out. We need to...

26:43.420 --> 26:45.028
Wait! Where are you going?!

26:59.447 --> 27:01.014
We said, "It's your turn."

27:03.607 --> 27:05.382
Peter, I can't tell
you what it means to me

27:05.385 --> 27:07.638
to actually spend time
with someone who's nice.

27:07.640 --> 27:09.873
Oh, please. I'm not always nice.

27:10.808 --> 27:12.476
Well, the night is young.

27:12.478 --> 27:14.645
Ah.

27:14.647 --> 27:16.813
Give me Stavros' eye.

27:25.758 --> 27:28.859
Hey, Standish, I could really
use some help with the traffic.

27:28.861 --> 27:31.461
Get her to Vichezna Street.
I'm in the municipal network.

27:31.463 --> 27:33.430
She'll have green lights the whole way.

27:33.432 --> 27:35.666
Thank you.

27:43.082 --> 27:44.082
Oh!

28:17.176 --> 28:18.608
Karen, are you okay?

28:18.610 --> 28:20.043
Peter, what's going on?

28:21.380 --> 28:22.910
My name isn't Peter.

28:22.913 --> 28:25.221
It's Will Chase, and I work for
the United States government.

28:25.223 --> 28:27.517
Karen, your husband was a very bad man

28:27.519 --> 28:29.386
who was connected to
some very bad people.

28:29.388 --> 28:33.323
And I had to use you to get to them.

28:33.325 --> 28:34.958
I'm sorry.

28:34.961 --> 28:38.096
You're a decent person. You
deserve better than this.

28:50.109 --> 28:51.842
You're welcome.

28:55.547 --> 28:56.913
Who was that?

28:57.982 --> 29:00.383
That's gonna cost me.

29:00.385 --> 29:02.586
There he is.

29:02.588 --> 29:04.354
International man of seduction.

29:04.356 --> 29:05.455
Come on.

29:05.457 --> 29:07.357
Hooking up for God and country.

29:07.359 --> 29:09.551
Oh, please. This doesn't count.

29:09.554 --> 29:10.918
What do you mean?

29:10.921 --> 29:13.439
He seduced Karen, and she agreed
to help us open up the vault.

29:13.442 --> 29:14.898
Honeytrap 2019!

29:14.900 --> 29:15.981
No, thank you.

29:15.984 --> 29:18.868
Doesn't count as a honeytrap
if she's not a mark to him.

29:18.871 --> 29:20.637
He likes her.

29:20.639 --> 29:22.906
I do not "like" the mark.

29:22.908 --> 29:25.489
And her name is Karen, by the way.

29:25.492 --> 29:27.143
I saw that kiss.

29:27.146 --> 29:29.082
And if you are emotionally involved,

29:29.085 --> 29:30.707
it could compromise the mission.

29:30.710 --> 29:32.377
Yes, it could, if I was.

29:32.380 --> 29:34.715
But I'm not, so it won't.

29:34.718 --> 29:35.954
You are!

29:35.957 --> 29:36.956
I'm not!

29:36.959 --> 29:38.387
You are.

29:38.390 --> 29:39.790
Wow.

29:39.792 --> 29:41.725
Complicated.

29:41.727 --> 29:43.403
What's he talking about?

29:43.406 --> 29:44.938
Isn't it obvious?

29:44.941 --> 29:47.242
Will connected with Karen, and...

29:47.245 --> 29:49.481
Frankie's a little jealous.

29:54.601 --> 29:56.469
Yeah, I didn't get that at all.

29:59.509 --> 30:01.876
Jai, Susan, Standish,
you cover the lobby.

30:01.879 --> 30:04.246
We'll head to the
vault, secure the ledger.

30:04.249 --> 30:06.043
And I'll be with you the entire time.

30:06.046 --> 30:07.312
Trust me.

30:07.315 --> 30:10.033
He likes her!

30:18.968 --> 30:20.137
Mrs. Pappas.

30:20.140 --> 30:22.192
I'm so sorry to hear about your husband.

30:22.195 --> 30:23.595
Thank you.

30:23.598 --> 30:24.930
And who are your guests?

30:24.933 --> 30:26.766
Hi. We're the attorneys for the estate.

30:26.769 --> 30:29.670
I'm Helen Conroy, and this
is my male secretary, Doug.

30:30.670 --> 30:32.938
I'm Doug.

30:32.941 --> 30:34.374
Male secretary.

30:34.377 --> 30:35.809
Nice to meet you.

30:35.812 --> 30:37.779
Right this way, please.

30:40.318 --> 30:42.699
I still don't get why
you lied to me yesterday.

30:42.702 --> 30:44.293
So, this bank is nice.

30:44.296 --> 30:45.429
Hey.

30:45.432 --> 30:46.531
I stood up for you.

30:46.534 --> 30:48.367
Don't take it personally.

30:48.370 --> 30:49.798
Okay? I'm just doing what I do.

30:49.801 --> 30:50.814
Now, I understand

30:50.817 --> 30:53.876
that you are an amazing
psychological profiler,

30:53.879 --> 30:56.630
but I kind of slipped one past you.

30:56.633 --> 30:58.496
You think that's what this is about?

30:58.499 --> 30:59.865
That I'm embarrassed?

30:59.868 --> 31:02.506
Well... yeah.

31:02.508 --> 31:04.742
First of all, I am way
too good at what I do

31:04.744 --> 31:06.777
for anyone to make me feel insecure.

31:06.779 --> 31:08.603
Second of all, I'm not mad.

31:08.606 --> 31:09.980
I just feel sorry for you.

31:09.982 --> 31:12.449
All of this... this fake
machismo, these lies...

31:12.451 --> 31:13.584
It's just a cover.

31:13.586 --> 31:15.052
- What?
- You can't be yourself

31:15.054 --> 31:16.720
because you don't think
you're worth a damn,

31:16.722 --> 31:18.767
which is why you've never
had a real relationship

31:18.770 --> 31:20.424
or any genuine intimacy,

31:20.426 --> 31:22.593
and if you keep it up, you never will.

31:23.862 --> 31:26.864
There. Just doing what I do.

31:28.133 --> 31:33.070
Ohhhhhhhhh.

31:45.951 --> 31:47.351
Your guns.

31:47.353 --> 31:48.852
Now.

31:48.854 --> 31:50.521
They arrived shortly before you.

31:50.524 --> 31:51.642
I'm very sorry.

31:51.645 --> 31:53.090
Apology not accepted.

31:53.092 --> 31:56.060
Will, Frankie, what's
going on down there?

31:57.595 --> 31:58.896
Nothing good.

31:58.898 --> 32:00.964
Stay put. Hostages at risk.

32:08.474 --> 32:10.140
Open it.

32:10.142 --> 32:12.611
I know you have Stavros' retinal scan.

32:12.614 --> 32:14.445
Okay. Just hold on.

32:23.189 --> 32:24.955
You too.

32:49.280 --> 32:51.189
All of you in the vault.

32:51.192 --> 32:53.951
Get the ledger.

33:10.269 --> 33:12.336
I'm sorry, Will.

33:12.338 --> 33:15.205
Don't worry. We'll get it back.

33:15.207 --> 33:16.540
No.

33:16.542 --> 33:17.996
I don't think you will.

33:20.645 --> 33:22.279
Good job, baby.

33:22.281 --> 33:23.618
Mm.

33:23.621 --> 33:26.917
I knew I had a better chance than you.

33:36.109 --> 33:37.876
If this ledger had gotten out,

33:37.879 --> 33:40.864
it would've caused
me a world of trouble.

33:40.866 --> 33:42.900
But I couldn't have done it without you.

33:42.902 --> 33:45.302
Thank you.

33:45.304 --> 33:46.564
Lock 'em in.

33:53.176 --> 33:55.879
So, what do you guys got
planned for your second date?

33:59.855 --> 34:01.504
Okay, you do not have
to rub this in my face.

34:01.506 --> 34:02.940
- I kind of do.
- All right? No, you don't.

34:02.942 --> 34:05.010
Will, I can't believe that
you let yourself like her.

34:05.012 --> 34:07.028
- What? No, no, no. I do not like her.
- Just admit it. You got played.

34:07.030 --> 34:08.645
- You're too trusting.
- I do not like... that's not true.

34:08.647 --> 34:10.137
- It's just what I told you was gonna happen.
- We needed her help to get in the vault.

34:10.139 --> 34:11.675
- It's not...
- Save your breath.

34:11.678 --> 34:14.581
If I'm right, you have less
than 10 minutes of oxygen.

34:16.159 --> 34:17.530
The hostages are okay.

34:17.533 --> 34:18.915
No sign of Hana or Karen.

34:18.918 --> 34:20.351
We're on our way to you.

34:20.353 --> 34:23.087
All right, Standish, uh, they
probably went out the back.

34:23.089 --> 34:25.274
Do me a favor. Make sure
they don't get too far, okay?

34:25.277 --> 34:27.841
Done. I'm scrambling
every traffic signal

34:27.844 --> 34:29.458
in the 10-block radius.

34:29.460 --> 34:31.261
It's about to be car-mageddon.

34:31.264 --> 34:33.264
All right, I'm looking at
a schematic of the vault.

34:33.266 --> 34:36.701
Uh, I-if you can override
the electrical system,

34:36.703 --> 34:39.036
that should short out the
lock and open the door.

34:39.038 --> 34:41.839
Great. How do we do that?

34:41.841 --> 34:43.074
I...

34:43.076 --> 34:46.110
Will, do you have that watch
I gave you for your date?

34:46.112 --> 34:47.143
Yeah. Why?

34:47.146 --> 34:48.231
Okay, I have news.

34:48.234 --> 34:50.052
It's filled with explosives.

34:50.054 --> 34:51.514
You're just telling me this now?

34:51.516 --> 34:53.451
Mm. He does that.

34:53.453 --> 34:56.253
There's a water main on the
left side of the rear wall.

34:56.255 --> 34:58.450
Yup.

34:58.453 --> 34:59.633
All right, listen.

34:59.636 --> 35:01.981
Put the watch on the wall, set the time.

35:03.019 --> 35:04.861
Stand back, like, 20 feet.

35:04.864 --> 35:07.031
We only have 10.

35:07.033 --> 35:09.467
What do you want me to say here?

35:09.469 --> 35:12.130
Okay. Watch out.

35:22.581 --> 35:23.714
That was it?

35:27.586 --> 35:29.687
Jai! Susan! Standish!

35:29.689 --> 35:32.490
Do you copy? Can you hear me?

35:32.492 --> 35:34.158
All right, now what?

35:34.160 --> 35:35.860
Now we wait for the
water to fill the vault

35:35.862 --> 35:37.128
and short the lock.

35:39.364 --> 35:40.865
Or we drown.

35:42.498 --> 35:43.598
Their comms are down.

35:43.601 --> 35:45.136
How do we know if it's working?

35:45.138 --> 35:47.071
W-W-We don't.

35:47.073 --> 35:48.572
It's not working!

35:48.574 --> 35:50.241
It's not working.

35:50.243 --> 35:51.942
Here. Help me with this.

36:01.521 --> 36:03.053
Frankie.

36:03.055 --> 36:06.056
Don't turn it into a big final
moment thing, Will. Don't.

36:06.058 --> 36:09.160
Uh...

36:09.162 --> 36:10.327
I did like her.

36:10.329 --> 36:11.476
You were right.

36:11.479 --> 36:13.798
I opened up my big, dumb heart, and I...

36:13.800 --> 36:16.634
It may have impacted the mission.

36:16.636 --> 36:18.469
May have?!

36:18.471 --> 36:20.571
Hey, I'm trying to apologize here.

36:22.007 --> 36:24.508
You don't need to apologize.

36:26.343 --> 36:27.744
Because your big, dumb heart

36:27.747 --> 36:30.214
isn't necessarily your worst quality.

36:30.216 --> 36:33.450
It breeds loyalty in people.
It's why they follow you.

36:33.452 --> 36:35.327
Don't get me wrong.

36:35.330 --> 36:36.952
I still think you're way too emotional,

36:36.955 --> 36:39.190
but then when I see the way
that you connect with people,

36:39.192 --> 36:40.925
I kind of envy that.

36:43.628 --> 36:46.130
Sometimes... Not all the time.

36:53.237 --> 36:56.606
This is taking too long.

36:56.609 --> 36:57.856
Door should've opened by now.

37:00.746 --> 37:02.012
Should we, um...

37:02.014 --> 37:03.914
Absolutely.

37:20.233 --> 37:21.832
You guys okay?

37:21.834 --> 37:24.602
Can we agree this is his fault?

37:24.604 --> 37:26.670
I rescind my "thank you."

37:26.672 --> 37:28.505
We need to find Karen.

37:28.507 --> 37:29.673
She burned the ledger.

37:29.675 --> 37:31.275
She has a photographic memory.

37:31.277 --> 37:33.210
She is the ledger.

37:33.212 --> 37:34.445
All right, let's go.

37:34.447 --> 37:36.680
Well, they can't be far.

37:40.218 --> 37:41.252
There!

37:44.757 --> 37:46.257
Get out! Go, go!

37:50.162 --> 37:52.496
All right, we got the
van. Go, go, go, go, go!

38:07.712 --> 38:09.113
Go. Get on a train.

38:09.115 --> 38:10.347
- I'll draw them off.
- Get down!

38:10.349 --> 38:11.548
Get down! Out of the way!

38:18.556 --> 38:20.624
I got this. Go, go, go, go, go.

38:20.626 --> 38:22.626
I'll get Blondie. You
get your girlfriend.

38:22.628 --> 38:25.296
She's not my... Ah, forget it.

38:48.354 --> 38:49.987
You're out of bullets!

38:49.989 --> 38:51.555
So are you!

39:07.506 --> 39:08.872
What's wrong?

39:08.874 --> 39:10.908
Didn't you bring a knife, too?

39:10.910 --> 39:13.110
No.

39:14.671 --> 39:16.780
Just an extra clip.

39:28.327 --> 39:29.493
Karen, stop!

39:29.495 --> 39:32.129
You don't understand.

39:32.131 --> 39:33.577
The people I do business with,

39:33.580 --> 39:35.432
if I go with you, I'm as good as dead.

39:35.434 --> 39:36.600
We can protect you.

39:38.237 --> 39:40.204
I wish that were true.

39:43.875 --> 39:45.676
We both know there's
only one way this ends.

39:45.678 --> 39:46.744
Karen, don't.

39:48.447 --> 39:50.481
Karen, stop!

39:52.918 --> 39:55.252
Aah!

40:00.525 --> 40:02.426
Why did you do that?

40:03.561 --> 40:06.382
Because I need you to tell me
everything that was in that ledger.

40:08.266 --> 40:10.901
Oh, what'd you think? We're
gonna run away together?

40:10.903 --> 40:12.336
I-I thought that you might...

40:12.338 --> 40:15.239
Karen, you're gonna tell me
everything I need to know.

40:15.241 --> 40:18.042
If you don't, I will put
you in a hole so deep,

40:18.044 --> 40:20.344
they'll never be able to find you.

40:25.265 --> 40:26.481
How good does that feel?

40:26.484 --> 40:27.918
You have no idea.

40:32.180 --> 40:35.158
_

40:35.161 --> 40:38.562
All right, great.
That's perfect. See ya.

40:38.564 --> 40:40.397
Dude, Karen spilled everything.

40:40.399 --> 40:41.665
What'd you say to her?

40:41.667 --> 40:43.400
♪ Why don't ya turn me loose ♪

40:43.402 --> 40:44.629
I was honest with her, Ray.

40:44.632 --> 40:46.003
♪ So I can run away ♪

40:47.239 --> 40:48.304
Good one.

40:48.307 --> 40:50.140
Hey, Prague was a blast, man.

40:50.142 --> 40:52.676
I'm really psyched that we're
working together, brother.

40:52.678 --> 40:54.445
Oh, I'm sure you are.

40:54.447 --> 40:57.081
- ♪ I don't get lost in the nighttime ♪
- Yeah.

40:57.083 --> 40:59.416
♪ I think I'll be just
fine during the day ♪

41:15.201 --> 41:16.233
He...

41:16.235 --> 41:18.602
Hey! Wha...

41:22.327 --> 41:24.208
- Hey, Ray.
- Aah.

41:24.210 --> 41:25.348
My brakes didn't work.

41:25.351 --> 41:26.510
- Weird.
- Yeah, I know.

41:26.512 --> 41:28.278
I just took this car
in and had it serviced.

41:28.280 --> 41:29.379
I don't...

41:29.381 --> 41:30.514
Did you cut my brakes?

41:30.516 --> 41:31.849
We're not here to talk about

41:31.851 --> 41:33.917
who did or didn't cut your brakes, Ray.

41:33.919 --> 41:37.221
What you did to Will is unforgivable.

41:37.223 --> 41:39.790
And he's too decent to
say this, but I'm not.

41:39.792 --> 41:41.658
You'll never be a part of this team.

41:41.660 --> 41:42.785
Understand?

41:46.432 --> 41:47.898
I could've died!

41:47.900 --> 41:50.046
Chance I was willing to take, Ray.

41:50.049 --> 41:51.502
So, I'm texting hot keg girl

41:51.504 --> 41:53.203
and telling her that I'm not a surgeon.

41:53.205 --> 41:54.484
Good. That's growth.

41:54.487 --> 41:55.838
And that I live with my mom.

41:55.841 --> 41:57.265
Ay. Overshare.

41:57.268 --> 41:58.634
Oh, she's sending a pic.

41:58.637 --> 42:00.148
- Maybe it's sexy.
- All right.

42:00.151 --> 42:02.418
Oh, no, it's just her flipping me off.

42:02.421 --> 42:03.648
Little tip...

42:03.651 --> 42:05.663
You don't have to tell
everyone everything.

42:05.666 --> 42:07.566
- Yeah, I think I know that now.
- Okay.

42:07.569 --> 42:10.937
Okay, this is the last
of Ray's apology whiskey,

42:10.940 --> 42:12.351
which we should be drinking.

42:12.354 --> 42:13.954
I will have one. I will not enjoy it.

42:13.957 --> 42:15.690
I will. It's expensive.

42:15.693 --> 42:16.959
Thank you.

42:16.962 --> 42:18.361
I got a toast.

42:18.364 --> 42:19.662
Where have you been?

42:19.665 --> 42:22.032
To my partner, the heartbreaker.

42:22.034 --> 42:24.001
King of the honeytrap.

42:24.003 --> 42:25.769
Definitely not.

42:26.877 --> 42:28.410
You owe me five bucks.

42:28.413 --> 42:29.946
Fair.
