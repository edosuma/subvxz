24:14.954 --> 24:16.789
the loinal region.

24:16.830 --> 24:20.000
[guests whooping]

24:16.830 --> 24:20.000
But just in--Jo--

24:20.042 --> 24:21.919
-I will--

24:20.042 --> 24:21.919
-Give it.

24:21.961 --> 24:23.879
Let me guess.

24:23.921 --> 24:25.923
[British accent]

24:23.921 --> 24:25.923
After one epic snog,

24:25.965 --> 24:29.509
you've been magically turned

24:25.965 --> 24:29.509
into a romantic.

24:29.551 --> 24:31.511
[normal voice] And even though

24:29.551 --> 24:31.511
giving your heart to somebody

24:31.553 --> 24:33.513
is a ridiculous, stupid risk,

24:33.555 --> 24:36.350
what would life be if nobody

24:33.555 --> 24:36.350
ever took that chance?

24:36.392 --> 24:39.437
And you, Scott, are here

24:36.392 --> 24:39.437
to say before God, friends,

24:39.477 --> 24:41.021
and people we don't know

24:41.063 --> 24:43.690
that you truly, madly,

24:41.063 --> 24:43.690
deeply adore me?

24:43.732 --> 24:45.401
Yes.

24:45.443 --> 24:47.527
Y-yes, actually.

24:45.443 --> 24:47.527
Well done.

24:47.569 --> 24:49.529
Okay, everybody listen up.

24:49.571 --> 24:52.699
No matter what feelings

24:49.571 --> 24:52.699
I have for this person,

24:52.741 --> 24:55.119
loinally or otherwise,

24:55.161 --> 24:57.704
we're a recipe for disaster.

24:57.746 --> 25:01.917
And he can say he loves me...

25:01.959 --> 25:04.586
[chuckles]

25:01.959 --> 25:04.586
But soon enough...

25:04.628 --> 25:07.047
believe me, sooner or later,

25:07.089 --> 25:08.257
this feeling will pass.

25:08.299 --> 25:10.009
No.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.927
I'm not Robert Frumpkis.

25:10.050 --> 25:11.927
I'm--

25:11.969 --> 25:14.013
But you're Scott.

25:14.054 --> 25:16.474
Man whore.

25:16.514 --> 25:19.226
[softly]

25:16.514 --> 25:19.226
And nobody ever changes.

25:20.602 --> 25:22.562
[normal voice]

25:20.602 --> 25:22.562
We are who we are.

25:24.648 --> 25:27.525
Just snap out of it.

25:29.611 --> 25:32.948
-[scattered applause]

25:29.611 --> 25:32.948
-Whoo! Yeah!

25:32.990 --> 25:34.908
You and Frump

25:32.990 --> 25:34.908
deserve each other.

25:37.911 --> 25:41.040
Best wedding

25:37.911 --> 25:41.040
I've ever been to.

25:41.081 --> 25:42.458
Seriously.

25:42.500 --> 25:44.460
Aw.

25:44.502 --> 25:45.919
[glasses clink]

25:48.797 --> 25:49.798
Is that...

25:51.549 --> 25:54.303
Yeah. That's the baby

25:51.549 --> 25:54.303
that lived in my girlfriend

25:54.345 --> 25:56.096
in your guesthouse

25:56.138 --> 25:58.891
and briefly

25:56.138 --> 25:58.891
in Taye Diggs' ball sack.

26:01.643 --> 26:05.064
And you have him why?

26:01.643 --> 26:05.064
I mean, I'm not...

26:05.105 --> 26:06.773
Let me just see that baby.

26:06.815 --> 26:07.774
[sniffs]

26:07.816 --> 26:09.193
[laughs]

26:07.816 --> 26:09.193
Abby.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.238
Oh.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.238
That's so scrumptious.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.864
Mm.

26:17.910 --> 26:20.538
What's going on?

26:20.578 --> 26:22.998
I mean,

26:20.578 --> 26:22.998
I come to pick up Lilly,

26:23.040 --> 26:24.833
and Frump tells me

26:23.040 --> 26:24.833
that story about Delia,

26:24.875 --> 26:27.794
and then you're in here.

26:27.836 --> 26:29.547
Abby...

26:30.923 --> 26:33.467
-Truth?

26:30.923 --> 26:33.467
-Mm-hmm.

26:34.968 --> 26:37.221
I took on too much.

26:37.263 --> 26:38.556
[chuckles]

26:38.596 --> 26:40.891
You? Really?

26:42.101 --> 26:45.729
Between SheShe

26:42.101 --> 26:45.729
and the book and the kids...

26:47.731 --> 26:49.483
And then trying

26:47.731 --> 26:49.483
to leapfrog

26:49.525 --> 26:52.069
into a new relationship

26:49.525 --> 26:52.069
with Dr. Perfect--

26:52.111 --> 26:53.862
-So not perfect.

26:52.111 --> 26:53.862
-Yeah, so not perfect.

26:53.904 --> 26:55.655
Yeah. That came

26:53.904 --> 26:55.655
to an ugly end,

26:55.697 --> 26:57.699
which we all saw coming.

26:57.741 --> 27:00.494
And then

26:57.741 --> 27:00.494
this little guy...

27:00.536 --> 27:02.371
I mean, that broke

27:00.536 --> 27:02.371
my heart a little bit,

27:02.413 --> 27:04.582
and not because of

27:02.413 --> 27:04.582
my baby stuff, you know,

27:04.622 --> 27:06.666
but because...

27:06.708 --> 27:09.128
because

27:06.708 --> 27:09.128
of the connection to you.

27:11.004 --> 27:12.465
Jake, having you gone

27:12.506 --> 27:14.716
was so much harder than

27:12.506 --> 27:14.716
I thought it was gonna be.

27:14.758 --> 27:18.178
Us married, I get that--

27:14.758 --> 27:18.178
that's over, but...

27:20.097 --> 27:21.848
Me and you...

27:21.890 --> 27:23.934
[softly]

27:21.890 --> 27:23.934
Yeah.

27:26.228 --> 27:28.314
I have a confession

27:26.228 --> 27:28.314
to make.

27:28.355 --> 27:31.066
Oh, my God, don't tell me

27:28.355 --> 27:31.066
there's a Latvian baby.

27:31.108 --> 27:32.692
Yes, there is.

27:32.734 --> 27:34.987
No, no Latvian baby,

27:35.028 --> 27:37.906
but I did not get stuck

27:35.028 --> 27:37.906
in the Helsinki airport.

27:37.948 --> 27:40.326
I got stuck on the floor

27:37.948 --> 27:40.326
of my hotel room.

27:40.367 --> 27:41.910
That movie wrapped,

27:41.952 --> 27:45.539
and this wave hit me.

27:45.581 --> 27:47.500
It was grief.

27:47.541 --> 27:50.752
It was grief over the death

27:47.541 --> 27:50.752
of Jake and Abby 2.0.

27:50.794 --> 27:52.712
I was just hoping

27:50.794 --> 27:52.712
to skip that part, you know,

27:52.754 --> 27:54.089
get to the heal part.

27:54.131 --> 27:57.050
Yeah, me too. I don't think

27:54.131 --> 27:57.050
it works like that.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.719
Obviously.

27:58.385 --> 27:59.719
I mean, this is the--

27:59.761 --> 28:00.929
the face of skipping it.

28:00.971 --> 28:03.098
I screwed

28:00.971 --> 28:03.098
everything up bad.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.808
The book's a mess

28:03.140 --> 28:04.808
because I'm trying

28:04.850 --> 28:07.019
to write about moving on,

28:04.850 --> 28:07.019
and I haven't.

28:07.060 --> 28:08.521
Okay, so feel that.

28:08.562 --> 28:12.024
I mean, I was eating

28:08.562 --> 28:12.024
Latvian carpet.

28:12.065 --> 28:14.734
I didn't...

28:12.065 --> 28:14.734
figure everything out,

28:14.776 --> 28:18.738
but I looked into that big,

28:14.776 --> 28:18.738
black hole of loneliness...

28:18.780 --> 28:21.408
and it's scary as shit.

28:21.450 --> 28:23.827
But I realized

28:21.450 --> 28:23.827
it's not gonna kill me.

28:23.869 --> 28:25.912
Well...

28:23.869 --> 28:25.912
it might kill me.

28:25.954 --> 28:29.082
No way.

28:25.954 --> 28:29.082
I promise.

28:31.877 --> 28:34.838
But you need to give me

28:31.877 --> 28:34.838
the kids for a week or two,

28:34.880 --> 28:37.132
and you need to go take

28:34.880 --> 28:37.132
the time

28:37.174 --> 28:40.844
to not be fine.

28:40.886 --> 28:44.431
And, yeah, part of us

28:40.886 --> 28:44.431
is over.

28:44.473 --> 28:47.601
And I will always

28:44.473 --> 28:47.601
be here for you.

28:47.643 --> 28:49.936
I'll always be here

28:47.643 --> 28:49.936
for you too...

28:49.978 --> 28:52.814
always.

28:52.856 --> 28:53.982
[baby fusses]

28:52.856 --> 28:53.982
Oh, sorry.

28:54.024 --> 28:55.984
-Oh, Jesus.

28:54.024 --> 28:55.984
-Sorry, little baby.

28:56.026 --> 28:58.945
[sighs]

28:58.987 --> 29:02.032
Oh, my God, I forgot

28:58.987 --> 29:02.032
to tell you the worst part.

29:02.074 --> 29:03.783
What's that?

29:02.074 --> 29:03.783
[clears throat]

29:03.825 --> 29:06.786
I had my first

29:03.825 --> 29:06.786
hot flash...today.

29:06.828 --> 29:09.289
-[both laugh]

29:06.828 --> 29:09.289
-Oh, honey.

29:09.331 --> 29:11.250
Why does God hate you?

29:11.291 --> 29:13.085
That's exactly

29:11.291 --> 29:13.085
what I said.

29:16.129 --> 29:17.631
Come here.

29:17.673 --> 29:19.049
[sniffles]

29:21.427 --> 29:23.762
We're gonna be okay.

29:29.476 --> 29:31.270
Um, there is one other

29:29.476 --> 29:31.270
slight wrinkle

29:31.311 --> 29:34.523
that I probably

29:31.311 --> 29:34.523
should mention.

29:36.858 --> 29:38.860
I mean, a gigolo--

29:36.858 --> 29:38.860
for Christ sakes, Abby.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.404
-A companion.

29:38.902 --> 29:40.404
-Gross.

29:40.446 --> 29:42.448
And technically,

29:40.446 --> 29:42.448
I never paid for the act.

29:42.489 --> 29:43.823
I paid him to talk,

29:43.865 --> 29:45.825
and then on a completely

29:43.865 --> 29:45.825
other occasion--

29:45.867 --> 29:48.412
Okay.

29:45.867 --> 29:48.412
Whatever.

29:48.454 --> 29:49.829
It's gonna hit

29:48.454 --> 29:49.829
the Internet.

29:49.871 --> 29:51.540
-What are we gonna tell Lilly?

29:49.871 --> 29:51.540
-I'll talk to her.

29:51.582 --> 29:53.041
No, we'll talk to her.

29:53.083 --> 29:54.834
I don't want you bamboozling her

29:53.083 --> 29:54.834
with your technicalities.

29:54.876 --> 29:56.836
Bamboozling?

29:54.876 --> 29:56.836
Really?

29:56.878 --> 29:58.213
She's gonna be fine.

29:58.255 --> 30:01.049
Who pays for sex--

29:58.255 --> 30:01.049
crack whores?

30:01.091 --> 30:03.093
Uh, well, actually,

30:01.091 --> 30:03.093
crack whores are more likely--

30:03.135 --> 30:05.845
Abby, not a teachable

30:03.135 --> 30:05.845
moment right now.

30:05.887 --> 30:09.642
Lilly, we understand how

30:05.887 --> 30:09.642
incredibly humiliating it is--

30:09.683 --> 30:11.351
Can I just say

30:09.683 --> 30:11.351
that if I were a man

30:11.393 --> 30:12.770
and I had an encounter...

30:12.811 --> 30:14.688
-Abby.

30:12.811 --> 30:14.688
-Unpaid with a professional,

30:14.730 --> 30:17.232
this would

30:14.730 --> 30:17.232
so not be a story.

30:17.274 --> 30:18.858
-Abby...

30:17.274 --> 30:18.858
-Gross.

30:18.900 --> 30:20.860
How could you do this to me?

30:20.902 --> 30:23.029
I mean, the whole time

30:20.902 --> 30:23.029
Dad's been gone,

30:23.071 --> 30:25.115
you've been so weird, like--

30:25.157 --> 30:26.866
And now this?

30:26.908 --> 30:29.869
I mean, I've been holding

30:26.908 --> 30:29.869
her hair back while she pukes,

30:29.911 --> 30:32.956
and she's been fainting

30:29.911 --> 30:32.956
and ending up in the hospital.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.708
-I hate you.

30:32.998 --> 30:34.708
-Lilly.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.836
What? It's your turn.

30:34.750 --> 30:37.836
You deal with her.

30:41.423 --> 30:44.760
She had to hold your

30:41.423 --> 30:44.760
hair back after you puked?

30:44.802 --> 30:45.885
I ate too much cake.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.887
Uh-huh.

30:47.929 --> 30:49.097
And you know what?

30:47.929 --> 30:49.097
She's upset.

30:49.139 --> 30:51.891
-She's gonna calm down.

30:49.139 --> 30:51.891
-Yeah. I don't know.

30:51.933 --> 30:53.644
This is a tough one.

30:59.983 --> 31:02.110
[sighs]

31:03.945 --> 31:06.406
-Family drama?

31:03.945 --> 31:06.406
-Not now, Barbara.

31:06.448 --> 31:09.535
I don't need another one

31:06.448 --> 31:09.535
of your lectures.

31:09.576 --> 31:11.203
Oh, I think you do.

31:11.244 --> 31:13.580
You really screwed the pooch

31:11.244 --> 31:13.580
on this one.

31:13.622 --> 31:15.915
Can you just stop?

31:13.622 --> 31:15.915
Seriously.

31:15.957 --> 31:19.753
I get it.

31:15.957 --> 31:19.753
Now you hate me again.

31:19.795 --> 31:21.505
No, see,

31:19.795 --> 31:21.505
here's the problem.

31:21.547 --> 31:25.300
Yeah, at first,

31:21.547 --> 31:25.300
your "sunny side" divorce crap

31:25.342 --> 31:28.178
made me crazy.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.514
But you wore me down.

31:30.556 --> 31:32.391
I like you,

31:30.556 --> 31:32.391
Abby McCarthy.

31:32.432 --> 31:34.727
I like your friends.

31:34.768 --> 31:37.855
In fact,

31:34.768 --> 31:37.855
you all give me hope.

31:37.896 --> 31:39.981
You make me want to see

31:37.896 --> 31:39.981
the upside of my situation,
