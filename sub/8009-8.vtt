00:18.999 --> 00:20.999
So tell us about your
vacation with Mason.

00:20.999 --> 00:23.999
- How was it?
- Kanye and I, like, had

00:23.999 --> 00:24.999
- this whole plan...
- Like, who walks him to

00:24.999 --> 00:26.999
- the airport?
- Seats were all separate,

00:26.999 --> 00:29.999
and I lose my mind on everyone.
We go to the airport.

00:29.999 --> 00:32.999
Everyone was trying to take
pictures, so we literally...

00:32.999 --> 00:34.999
We need to get a
family aircraft.

00:34.999 --> 00:36.999
Yeah, we do.

00:36.999 --> 00:38.999
Kardashian Aviation!

00:38.999 --> 00:40.999
- Oh, my God.
- Yes!

00:40.999 --> 00:44.999
Can we get... I want a 787, John
Travolta-style.

00:44.999 --> 00:47.999
- Pimp it out...
- Do you have $30 million?

00:47.999 --> 00:50.999
We need a $5 million
aircraft.

00:50.999 --> 00:51.999
We need the money?
I thought we just wanted a

00:51.999 --> 00:53.999
- plane.
- Or a $6 million plane.

00:53.999 --> 00:54.999
Tyler Perry offered to
sell me his plane.

00:54.999 --> 00:57.999
Wait. Excuse me!
We're gonna get a 787.

00:57.999 --> 00:59.999
- We're gonna put beds in it.
- We should get a

00:59.999 --> 01:01.999
- Challenger.
- When I fly with Puff,

01:01.999 --> 01:03.999
Puff has a whole back room...
it's a bedroom.

01:03.999 --> 01:04.999
- It's a bed.
- Who needs that,

01:04.999 --> 01:06.999
- really?
- I do.

01:06.999 --> 01:17.999
Oh, my God.♪ ♪

01:25.999 --> 01:28.999
Is this how hoes,
like, type?

01:28.999 --> 01:30.999
- With their nails?
- I don't know, I rarely

01:30.999 --> 01:32.999
have long nails.
I only do it, like, once a year.

01:32.999 --> 01:34.999
- Not you.
- She's talking about

01:34.999 --> 01:36.999
- me.
- I mean Kim-- Khloe.

01:36.999 --> 01:37.999
- She's calling me a ho.
Mm-hmm.

01:37.999 --> 01:39.999
All right.
So what is the deal for New

01:39.999 --> 01:41.999
York?
You're leaving Saturday?

01:41.999 --> 01:43.999
I'm gonna go.
Kanye has a fashion show on the

01:43.999 --> 01:46.999
- tenth for Yeezy Season 2...
- Okay.

01:46.999 --> 01:47.999
...if you guys want to
come.

01:47.999 --> 01:49.999
How did that happen
already? Season 2?

01:49.999 --> 01:51.999
And the day before that,
we do our app launch.

01:51.999 --> 01:54.999
They got to preview the apps,
like, on the phones.

01:54.999 --> 01:57.999
- Everyone's loving it.
- Really?

01:57.999 --> 01:59.999
My sisters and I are
launching our new apps.

01:59.999 --> 02:02.999
We have a big event in New York.
We've been working endless hours

02:02.999 --> 02:05.999
of the night to make sure that
they're perfect.

02:05.999 --> 02:07.999
I don't think all five sisters
have ever done a big deal

02:07.999 --> 02:10.999
together and I'm excited for the
world to see it.

02:10.999 --> 02:12.999
I need to actually
talk to them again, 'cause they

02:12.999 --> 02:16.999
are only putting me in one
category, which is more mom

02:16.999 --> 02:19.999
stuff, which I said, "I am a
person who does other things,

02:19.999 --> 02:23.999
too."
They don't, like, get me.

02:23.999 --> 02:26.999
Well, they said you kept
on saying you didn't want to do

02:26.999 --> 02:28.999
subscription, you didn't want to
do content, you didn't want to

02:28.999 --> 02:29.999
- do this...
- No, I didn't.

02:29.999 --> 02:31.999
They were just, like...
They don't know what they're

02:31.999 --> 02:33.999
- doing with me.
- But I think you should

02:33.999 --> 02:35.999
maybe suggest, like, what you
would be comfortable with,

02:35.999 --> 02:37.999
'cause I don't know if they know
where... what direction to take

02:37.999 --> 02:38.999
- you in.
- I know the stuff

02:38.999 --> 02:40.999
that I'm passionate about.
I'm given them, like, exact

02:40.999 --> 02:43.999
plugs.
I think they've kind of dropped

02:43.999 --> 02:45.999
- the ball...
- And they think you

02:45.999 --> 02:48.999
- dropped the ball.
- That's what they're

02:48.999 --> 02:50.999
- saying.
- But I don't want to  with

02:50.999 --> 02:53.999
- people like that.
- Talking.

02:53.999 --> 02:56.999
During the time that
my sisters and I were working on

02:56.999 --> 03:00.999
our apps, you know, Kourtney was
preoccupied because of the baby,

03:00.999 --> 03:03.999
and she's also had a pretty
tough year.

03:03.999 --> 03:06.999
But trying to shift the blame as
to why her app is late is

03:06.999 --> 03:10.999
delusional.
The truth is, Kourt, you dropped

03:10.999 --> 03:14.999
the ball.
Have you seen the movie theater?

03:14.999 --> 03:16.999
What?

03:16.999 --> 03:18.999
Let's go see the movie theater.
She did drop the ball.

03:18.999 --> 03:20.999
Yeah.
She just doesn't want to do it

03:20.999 --> 03:22.999
now.
She's pissed that we're all

03:22.999 --> 03:24.000
- doing it.
- Well, she should be.

03:24.000 --> 03:34.999
Yeah.♪ ♪

03:34.999 --> 03:37.999
How funny is this video?
Let me show you.

03:37.999 --> 03:42.999
- How cool do I look, by the way?
- Her name is Kim.

03:42.999 --> 03:46.999
She's gonna be famous when she
grows up.

03:46.999 --> 03:49.999
- Weird.
- Isn't that so funny?

03:49.999 --> 03:50.999
Who says that?
"She's gonna be famous"?

03:50.999 --> 03:53.999
- That's Khloe talking.
- Weird!

03:53.999 --> 03:57.999
So funny, right?
So... I just wanted to go over

03:57.999 --> 03:59.999
with you...
So you're gonna walk in Kanye's

03:59.999 --> 04:01.999
show.
Like last time.

04:01.999 --> 04:03.999
- Oh...
- I feel like you're

04:03.999 --> 04:06.999
totally, like, the vibe of
Yeezy, you know?

04:06.999 --> 04:07.999
Yeah, no, I love doing
it.

04:07.999 --> 04:09.999
Kylie's walking in
Kanye's fashion show.

04:09.999 --> 04:13.999
Kylie did the show last year, so
she definitely knows the drill

04:13.999 --> 04:15.999
- and knows how it is.
- I'm so excited.

04:15.999 --> 04:17.999
Yeah, it's like you're a
thing.

04:17.999 --> 04:20.999
Kylie has a really cool, like,
unique look and Kanye wants kind

04:20.999 --> 04:23.999
of, like, these underground,
really cool vibes.

04:23.999 --> 04:25.999
And, you know, I always get
nervous.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.999
I've been hearing things, like
Kylie makes people wait 'cause

04:27.999 --> 04:31.999
she's on her phone, or if she's
at photo shoots, she brings a

04:31.999 --> 04:33.999
ton of friends.
So I just want Kylie to know

04:33.999 --> 04:36.999
just because Kanye's family,
like, this isn't, like, a casual

04:36.999 --> 04:38.999
situation.
She has to be really

04:38.999 --> 04:40.999
professional and go with the
flow.

04:40.999 --> 04:42.999
You know, he's, like, such a
perfectionist, obviously.

04:42.999 --> 04:47.999
And this is, like, a really big
deal, to do a-a second show.

04:47.999 --> 04:50.999
His first show did so well.
You know, and the second one,

04:50.999 --> 04:52.999
it's like, even that much more
pressure.

04:52.999 --> 04:54.999
- Mmm, yeah.
- So I just want it to be

04:54.999 --> 04:56.999
perfect.
It'll be so much fun.

04:56.999 --> 04:58.999
- Yeah.
- And I just want you to,

Okay, wait a
sec and then we'll go.

05:31.999 --> 05:34.999
I love this cut.
She has a body double.

05:34.999 --> 05:39.999
She has somebody come over here
and put a prosthesis on, like a

05:39.999 --> 05:43.999
pregnant person, and she makes
them try on all of her clothes

05:43.999 --> 05:45.999
because she's too tired to do
it.

05:45.999 --> 05:47.999
And then she puts the
pictures...

05:47.999 --> 05:49.999
- How great is this?
- That doesn't look

05:49.999 --> 05:51.999
- like Kim's size.
- Is the body double

05:51.999 --> 05:55.999
gonna start eating beignets?

What day are you gonna leave for
New York?

06:01.999 --> 06:03.999
- Not till Sunday.
- And what's the plan

06:03.999 --> 06:05.999
- with the kids?
- It's three nights,

06:05.999 --> 06:08.999

could be around.

06:08.999 --> 06:10.999
Is Scott gonna be
around?

I don't know.
So we'll see.

06:13.999 --> 06:15.999
just be available...
I'd rather someone else be

06:15.999 --> 06:17.999
- there, too.
- Right.

06:17.999 --> 06:19.999
And then Reign's
coming with me.

06:19.999 --> 06:21.999
I think it's really
good that you're going and,

06:21.999 --> 06:24.999
- like, leaving the kids at home.
- Why is that good?

06:24.999 --> 06:27.999
I just think it's good
for you to get out and about for

06:27.999 --> 06:29.999
a little while.
And you're going to the big app

06:29.999 --> 06:33.999
- announcement for the girls.
- Why is it "for the

06:33.999 --> 06:36.999
girls" and not for me?
I don't get it.

06:36.999 --> 06:39.999
Because your app isn't
launching.

06:39.999 --> 06:42.999
But then-then why
am I going?

06:42.999 --> 06:45.999
I'm not going if it's not-not
about me.

06:45.999 --> 06:48.999
I knew that my app was going to
be behind, but I didn't really

06:48.999 --> 06:53.999
realize that mine was the only
app that wasn't going to be

06:53.999 --> 06:55.999
- launching.
- Can I ask you a

06:55.999 --> 06:56.999
- question?
- Hmm?

06:56.999 --> 06:59.999
How come you didn't do
what every... your other four

06:59.999 --> 07:01.999
- sisters did...
- I am.

07:01.999 --> 07:03.999
...and do what they
wanted you to do and keep up

07:03.999 --> 07:05.999
- with the program?
- They didn't.

07:05.999 --> 07:07.999
Not one person has bothered me
about this.

07:07.999 --> 07:09.999
Jeff said you didn't
even want to take meetings with

07:09.999 --> 07:11.999
- him.
- Yeah, I did.

07:11.999 --> 07:16.000
First of all, I just had a baby,
so when he was maybe meeting, we

07:16.000 --> 07:18.999
may have pushed some meetings
and said, "I'm unavailable for

07:18.999 --> 07:21.999
these two months."
They had me for months before.

07:21.999 --> 07:24.000
Well, two months was
like... the crunch time.

07:24.000 --> 07:25.999
He should've
said... he should've then

07:25.999 --> 07:28.999
communicated.
He never explained any of this

07:28.999 --> 07:31.999
to me.
So you guys need to have a

07:31.999 --> 07:33.999
- conversation and figure it out.
- But you were at all the

07:33.999 --> 07:35.999
same meetings that everyone else
was at.

07:35.999 --> 07:40.999
No, I wasn't.
What meetings?

07:40.999 --> 07:42.999
I want you to watch a
lot of good movies that you

07:42.999 --> 07:45.999
missed out on.
Boyz n the

07:45.999 --> 07:47.999
Friday,
you haven't seen...

07:47.999 --> 07:49.999
- Boyz n the Hood?
- You didn't have the

07:49.999 --> 07:52.999
right African-American man in
your life.

07:52.999 --> 07:54.999
I mean, I could
stay, too.

07:54.999 --> 07:56.999
- I just had a baby...
- So what?

07:56.999 --> 07:58.999
Everyone in life has a baby and
they work, like, ten jobs.

07:58.999 --> 08:05.999
- You're not special. Sorry.
- Ooh, Felicia!

08:05.999 --> 08:08.999
You guys need to
have a conversation and figure

08:08.999 --> 08:10.999
it out.
He never explained any of this

08:10.999 --> 08:12.999
- to me.
- But you were at all the

08:12.999 --> 08:14.999
- same meetings...
- No, I wasn't.

08:14.999 --> 08:17.999
What meetings?
What meetings?

08:17.999 --> 08:19.999
I'm not going if they're not
talking about mine.

08:19.999 --> 08:21.999
- There's absolutely no point...
- Of course they're gonna

08:21.999 --> 08:23.999
- talk about it.
- ...for me to go.

08:23.999 --> 08:26.999
So you'd better figure this out,
bef... 'cause I need to cancel

08:26.999 --> 08:28.999
- my travel and all my plans.
- You're the one who was

08:28.999 --> 08:30.999
- supposed to be having the...
- I'm not figuring

08:30.999 --> 08:34.999
this out.
Get him on the phone now.

08:34.999 --> 08:37.999

Hey, I've got Jen with
me.

08:42.999 --> 08:43.999
- Hi.
- Hi, Jen.

08:43.999 --> 08:47.999
Kourtney's right here.
We were talking about the thing

08:47.999 --> 08:48.999
- in New York.
- Is there a reason

08:48.999 --> 08:52.999
no one communicated to me that
mine would be pushed?

08:52.999 --> 08:56.999
First of all, to build
these apps takes a few months.

08:56.999 --> 08:58.999
You know, Kourt, you've had a
lot going on.

08:58.999 --> 09:01.999
There was a lull in... for the
communication.

09:01.999 --> 09:05.999
Um, because of that lull,
logistically, it's not

09:05.999 --> 09:08.999
- physically possible.
- But she's just

09:08.999 --> 09:10.999
wondering, is it worth her
coming to New York?

09:10.999 --> 09:12.999
Yeah, I mean, I think
it will be an opportunity,

09:12.999 --> 09:14.999
obviously, for Kourtney to talk
about why she's doing this and

09:14.999 --> 09:17.999
why she's excited about it and
what she's planning.

09:17.999 --> 09:19.999
But it's not ready, and, you
know, we're gonna launch when

09:19.999 --> 09:22.999
it's ready.
So long as she's comfortable

09:22.999 --> 09:24.999
with that, I think it's great
if-if she can be there.

09:24.999 --> 09:26.999
- Yeah.
It's-it's ultimately

09:26.999 --> 09:29.999
- really up to her.
- Yeah.

09:29.999 --> 09:31.999
So, Kourt, why don't you
just think about it for another

09:31.999 --> 09:33.999
day and let me know, like,
where your comfort level is.

09:33.999 --> 09:47.999
Okay, cool.♪ ♪

stunt on these hoes like no one

09:50.999 --> 09:53.999
ever knew.
This is New York Fashion Week,

09:53.999 --> 09:56.000
so this is one of the craziest
weeks that you could be in New

09:56.000 --> 09:58.000
York City.
Our apps are launching this

09:58.000 --> 10:00.000
week.
Kendall's walking in the

10:00.000 --> 10:02.999
Givenchy show.
Kylie is modeling for Kanye's

10:02.999 --> 10:04.999
show.
Oh, I used to love doing Fashion

10:04.999 --> 10:07.999
Week with my sisters.
And now I get to do it with two

10:07.999 --> 10:09.999
more sisters, so it's that much
more fun.

10:09.999 --> 10:11.999
You guys, why don't we just have
a threesome and then, like, have

10:11.999 --> 10:14.999
our own...
What could our name be?

10:14.999 --> 10:17.999
- Um, let's see, Khlo...
- Khloe, Khloga.

10:17.999 --> 10:19.999
- Khloga?
- I like Khloga.

10:19.999 --> 10:20.999
Should we just date
and then you should date

10:20.999 --> 10:22.999
- someone else?
- Yeah, probably.

10:22.999 --> 10:24.999
- Khloga.
- T is here.

10:24.999 --> 10:27.999
I'm just really happy that we
get to spend a little time in

10:27.999 --> 10:29.999
- New York.
- I saw you wore my

10:29.999 --> 10:32.999
my
magazine cover came out.

10:32.999 --> 10:34.999
No, you have a
magazine cover in it?

10:34.999 --> 10:36.999
I sh-- it's for my
book; that's why I showed you.

10:36.999 --> 10:38.999
You did not show me
a magazine cover.

10:38.999 --> 10:40.999
At your birthday
dinner.

10:40.999 --> 10:42.999
I didn't realize it
was a thing then.

10:42.999 --> 10:43.999
That's okay, Kylie.
It's okay.

10:43.999 --> 10:45.999
Steal my blonde hair, steal my
bathing suit.

10:45.999 --> 10:48.999
Everyone thinks I'm copying you.
But it's okay.

10:55.999 --> 10:58.999
Oh, my God.

10:58.999 --> 11:00.999
Okay, everyone, back a bit,
please.

11:00.999 --> 11:02.999
- Back up.
- Straight ahead,

11:02.999 --> 11:04.999
straight ahead.

11:04.999 --> 11:06.999
Boy, talk about a
walk.

11:06.999 --> 11:09.999
I know.
My water might break.

11:09.999 --> 11:11.999
- Yeah.
- It's so exciting that

11:11.999 --> 11:15.999
the Givenchy show this year is
in New York.

11:15.999 --> 11:19.999
He's one of mine and Kanye's,
like, absolute favorite

11:19.999 --> 11:22.999
designers.
You know, I think it's so great

11:22.999 --> 11:24.999
to see Kendall walk in a show.
And it's been just so much fun

11:24.999 --> 11:27.999
to see her really come into her
own.

11:27.999 --> 11:30.999
How are you?

11:30.999 --> 11:32.999
- Good.
- Okay, like, I say this

11:32.999 --> 11:34.999
every time-- that was the best
thing I've ever seen.

11:34.999 --> 11:37.999
- No, seriously, like dying.
- That was so dope.

11:37.999 --> 11:39.999
It was, like, the
perfect lighting.

11:39.999 --> 11:41.999
- Aw...
- Thank God it didn't

11:41.999 --> 11:42.999
- rain.
- I like the piercings

11:42.999 --> 11:44.999
in the back.
The, like, the kind of the...

11:44.999 --> 11:46.999
Everything was so
amazing.

11:46.999 --> 11:48.999
So, I'll see
you Thursday, yeah?

11:58.999 --> 12:01.999
Ooh, yummy.
Thank you.

12:01.999 --> 12:03.999
You're welcome.
Please enjoy!

12:03.999 --> 12:05.999
Oh, thank you.
Cheers.

12:05.999 --> 12:08.999
- I missed you.
- I missed you, too.

12:08.999 --> 12:10.999
Hey, Mom.

12:10.999 --> 12:12.999
Hi.
What are you doing?

12:12.999 --> 12:14.999
Wait, wait.
That's my friend.

12:14.999 --> 12:16.999
Cleaning out
my dishes.

12:16.999 --> 12:18.999
- But that's my friend.
- On Friday night?

12:18.999 --> 12:20.999
Like, in ten
minutes, I'm gonna start

12:20.999 --> 12:23.999
packing for New York.
Pick out my outfits.

12:23.999 --> 12:26.999
We got to celebrate!
You're going on a trip.

12:26.999 --> 12:28.999
- Don't meet no dudes.
- She could meet a dude.

12:28.999 --> 12:30.999
No, I'm not going
to.

12:30.999 --> 12:33.999
I am disappointed that
I didn't go to Fashion Week.

12:33.999 --> 12:36.999
But I'm really proud of Kourtney
for going to New York with all

12:36.999 --> 12:39.999
- of her sisters.
- We love you.

12:39.999 --> 12:41.999
- Okay!
- All right.

12:41.999 --> 12:43.999
- Bye, guys.
- Bye.

12:43.999 --> 12:45.999
- She's so cute.
- I want you to pick

12:45.999 --> 12:47.999
five movies you want me to
watch, and I'm gonna pick five

12:47.999 --> 12:50.999
- movies I want you to watch.
- Okay, but your-your

12:50.999 --> 12:53.999
movies are all, like, they star
Eddie Murphy.

12:53.999 --> 12:56.999
My movies are classics.
So tell me the difference.

12:56.999 --> 12:58.999
What the hell you
mean?

12:58.999 --> 13:00.999
E-Eddie Murphy is classic.
Boomerang?

13:00.999 --> 13:02.999
Boomerang?
Gone with the

13:02.999 --> 13:05.999
Wind.
How about I got to make you

13:05.999 --> 13:09.999
Dr. Zhivago, Mary Poppins?
I mean, hello?

13:09.999 --> 13:11.999
Boyz
n the Hood.

13:11.999 --> 13:13.999
Friday.
You haven't seen...

13:13.999 --> 13:15.999
- Boyz n the Hood?
- I want you to watch a

13:15.999 --> 13:17.999
lot of good movies that you've
missed out on.

13:17.999 --> 13:19.999
You didn't have the right
African-American man in your

13:19.999 --> 13:22.999
life.
Look, that's gonna be us in a

13:22.999 --> 13:25.000
minute.
You got to be ready, baby.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.000
- Oh, my God.
- Romance, romance

13:27.000 --> 13:29.000
is in the air.
Did you see how...?

13:29.000 --> 13:31.000
- Romance is in the air?
- Did you see them?

13:31.000 --> 13:33.000
- That's how I'm gonna be...
- You're rushing it.

13:33.000 --> 13:35.000
- You're rushing it.
- And I'm gonna be

13:35.000 --> 13:43.999
pulling you.♪ ♪

13:43.999 --> 13:50.999
Watch out!

13:50.999 --> 13:53.999
Even though, you
know, my app is not ready and I

13:53.999 --> 13:56.999
am disappointed, I decide to
still go to New York to support

13:56.999 --> 13:59.999
everybody else.
I'm gonna go and do my best.

13:59.999 --> 14:03.999
Doesn't this remind you
of back in the day?

14:03.999 --> 14:06.999
But when we used to come for
Fashion Week, like...?

14:06.999 --> 14:09.999
- Yeah.
- It was so fun.

14:09.999 --> 14:12.999
- Back in the day?
- Nowadays, yeah, I

14:12.999 --> 14:15.999
still see my sisters, but it's
rare that we get to be out and

14:15.999 --> 14:18.999
doing, like, really fun things
together.

14:18.999 --> 14:20.999
So, Kourtney, Kim and I, like,
after, my dad died and, like,

14:20.999 --> 14:23.999
we started, like, doing DASH and
stuff, I... we all started

14:23.999 --> 14:27.999
hanging out, like, all the time.
And for some reason, we were,

14:27.999 --> 14:30.999
- like, inseparable.
- I used to go to Kress.

14:30.999 --> 14:31.999
That's when I first met her and
Scott.

14:31.999 --> 14:33.999
- Yeah.
- Oh, my God.

14:33.999 --> 14:36.999
And then, I was, like,
16, 17, and you was coming out.

14:36.999 --> 14:37.999
Wait, I know
where...

14:37.999 --> 14:38.999
You were so drunk.
You were just, like, trippin'.

14:38.999 --> 14:40.999
- Me?
- That's the first time I

14:40.999 --> 14:42.999
ever seen you, and I was just
like, I was just looking like,

14:42.999 --> 14:44.999
this  is crazy.
Like, you were wild and like...

14:44.999 --> 14:46.999
Great first
impression.

14:46.999 --> 14:48.999
- I used to fight all the time.
- That's, like, the

14:48.999 --> 14:50.999
- first, I still have that memory.
- No, I used to get it,

14:50.999 --> 14:53.999
if someone, like, would touch
Kim, like, just graze her--

14:53.999 --> 14:55.999
it's a club, of course someone's
gonna hit you.

14:55.999 --> 14:57.999
I would push the  out of
them and they would fall back.

14:57.999 --> 14:59.999
They're like, and they would,
like, try to get, like, like,

14:59.999 --> 15:02.999
"What, you just hit me?"
And I'm like, "Don't you dare

15:02.999 --> 15:05.999
come at me!"
Like, I used to be insane.

15:05.999 --> 15:08.999
Kourtney, one time, got punched
in the face!

15:08.999 --> 15:11.999
And it was a dinner
party for, like, 30 people

15:11.999 --> 15:13.999
- and...
- And then all of a

15:13.999 --> 15:15.999
- sudden, Kourtney disappears.
- I went to the

15:15.999 --> 15:17.999
bathroom.
And I was in line.

15:17.999 --> 15:19.999
Oh, I
remember...

15:19.999 --> 15:21.999
And this girl cut
in front of me in the line.

15:21.999 --> 15:23.999
And I go, "Excuse me?"
She literally...

15:23.999 --> 15:25.999
You know Kourtney's
voice-- she goes, "Excuse me,

15:25.999 --> 15:27.999
you cut!"
And she literally

15:27.999 --> 15:30.999
turned around to me and just
goes boom right in the face.

15:30.999 --> 15:32.999
- So Kourtney...
- I've never been

15:32.999 --> 15:35.999
punched in the face except for
that only time.

15:35.999 --> 15:37.999
- It was, like, crazy.
- Thank God you guys were

15:37.999 --> 15:41.999
running late, because I had so
much stuff to go over on my app.

15:41.999 --> 15:43.999
Like, you have no idea.
And I needed to change so much

15:43.999 --> 15:45.999
- stuff.
- Kim, for our app

15:45.999 --> 15:47.999
launches, what are we all
wearing?

15:47.999 --> 15:49.999
It has to be, like, united
front.

15:49.999 --> 15:51.999
And I just need to
know, because I have get up at

15:51.999 --> 15:54.999
7-7:00 a.m. and put that outfit
on and wear it to work.

15:54.999 --> 15:56.999
You guys, we're being
magazine,

15:56.999 --> 15:59.999
the head person.
Did they tell you that?

15:59.999 --> 16:01.999
- It's, like, a big serious thing.
- We got to have our

16:01.999 --> 16:03.999
together.
They're gonna ask you about the

16:03.999 --> 16:05.999
- apps.
- So, we're all being

16:05.999 --> 16:07.999
- Fortune?
- We're on a panel, like a

16:07.999 --> 16:09.999
press conference, and we're all
sitting there...

16:09.999 --> 16:11.999
Mine's launching
later.

16:11.999 --> 16:14.999
Could we talk about the
messaging, though?

16:14.999 --> 16:16.999
Yours is just launching in
December, because yours is more

16:16.999 --> 16:19.999
lifestyle.
I think just say that, because

16:19.999 --> 16:22.999
it's gonna look bad, like, "It
just wasn't ready."

16:22.999 --> 16:25.999
I mean, I could
say, too, I just had a baby when

16:25.999 --> 16:28.999
- we were working on it...
- No, no. So what?

16:28.999 --> 16:31.999
I'm pregnant and I have a ba...
Everyone in life has a baby and

16:31.999 --> 16:34.999
- they work, like, ten jobs.
- Everyone in life.

16:34.999 --> 16:37.999
No excuses, like, you
knew you were having this baby

16:37.999 --> 16:40.999
nine months before you did.
And you knew you had this app a

16:40.999 --> 16:43.999
year ago, so there was no, to me
there's no excuses.

16:43.999 --> 16:47.999
- You're not special, sorry.
- Ooh, Felicia!

16:47.999 --> 16:51.999
It's already
procrastinating.

16:51.999 --> 16:54.999
I need to talk to you privately.
Because I've had pregnancy

16:54.999 --> 16:57.999
issues in the past, it's just
easiest to have Jonathan do it.

16:57.999 --> 16:59.999
Don't give me
the details.

16:59.999 --> 17:01.999
I need to pee in a cup.
And I just need it dropped off

17:01.999 --> 17:03.999
- to the doctor.
- Are you

17:03.999 --> 17:06.999
sick?

17:06.999 --> 17:08.999
Tonight is my release
party.

17:08.999 --> 17:10.999
Kylie, that's
up.

17:10.999 --> 17:13.999
Kylie, that's  up.
That's so annoying.

17:13.999 --> 17:14.999
Kylie!

17:22.999 --> 17:25.999
Hi.

17:25.999 --> 17:27.999
- Oh, come on.
- I'm bored.

17:27.999 --> 17:29.999
These things are, like,
so ridiculous.

17:29.999 --> 17:31.999
- Like, I don't understand.
- I'm in the city, so

17:31.999 --> 17:34.999
I need to pretend like we're out
somewhere like... in the

17:34.999 --> 17:36.999
- wilderness.
- I feel like I haven't

17:36.999 --> 17:39.999
- been here in so long.
- What's up?

17:39.999 --> 17:41.999
Look at this  bam-bam
outfit.

17:41.999 --> 17:43.999
- I love that.
- Since I have so much

17:43.999 --> 17:46.999
work to do on my app, we're
gonna be at Jonathan's apartment

17:46.999 --> 17:49.999
for a couple hours working.
"Unlock my world.

17:49.999 --> 17:51.999
Get the Kim App."
Should it be

17:51.999 --> 17:53.999
called "the Kim App"?
Is that what we're calling it?

17:53.999 --> 17:55.999
Hey, guys, it's Kim.
My new app is filled with so

17:55.999 --> 17:58.999
many amazing new features that I
can't wait for you to see...

17:58.999 --> 18:00.999
That lighting's good.
I don't really like that

18:00.999 --> 18:02.999
- close-up.
- Yeah.

18:02.999 --> 18:04.999
Already you're
making notes?

18:04.999 --> 18:05.999
Yeah. I need to do,
like, tons of these.

18:05.999 --> 18:07.999
Wait, so I need to talk to you
privately.

18:07.999 --> 18:09.999
Why are you
smirking?

18:09.999 --> 18:10.999
- No, no, no, 'cause I...
- Why are you

18:10.999 --> 18:13.999
- smirking?
- So because I've had, you

18:13.999 --> 18:16.999
know, pregnancy issues in the
past, I need something dropped

18:16.999 --> 18:18.999
off at a lab.
Can you drop one thing off for

18:18.999 --> 18:20.999
- me?
- No, because you

18:20.999 --> 18:22.999
- have Stephanie...
- I mean, I would send

18:22.999 --> 18:24.999
Stephanie, but we're, like, in
such a groove getting all this

18:24.999 --> 18:26.999
content for my app.
Jonathan's my best friend, and I

18:26.999 --> 18:28.999
don't know who else I would even
ask to do this.

18:28.999 --> 18:30.999
You're pregnant, I
know this already.

18:30.999 --> 18:31.999
That freaks me out, don't give
me the details.

18:31.999 --> 18:34.999
- I need to pee in a cup.
- And I just need it

18:34.999 --> 18:36.999
- dropped off to the doctor.
- Are you

18:36.999 --> 18:39.999
sick?
What do you mean?

18:39.999 --> 18:41.999
You want me to go walk around
with your piss?

18:41.999 --> 18:44.999
No one will ever know.
Look, I got the cup from the

18:44.999 --> 18:46.999
doctor.
And it'll be in this bag.

18:46.999 --> 18:49.999
That is disgusting.
I won't even, like, hold my own

Except for your stomach is a

28:51.999 --> 28:54.999
blob.
It's like... rolls.

28:54.999 --> 28:57.999
- And squishy.
- Squishy rolls.

29:06.999 --> 29:08.999
I took Corey, we went
for a party, and I'm like, "This

29:08.999 --> 29:10.999
is that... the art I've been
telling you about, Mr.

29:10.999 --> 29:13.999
Brainwash."
And I said, "I want to call him,

29:13.999 --> 29:15.999
go to his studio and see what's
going on over there."

29:15.999 --> 29:18.999
So here we are.

29:18.999 --> 29:20.999
But I really love your stuff.
Life Is Beautiful?

29:20.999 --> 29:22.999
- Yeah.
- That is so good.

29:22.999 --> 29:24.999
- Who'd you make that for?
- It's...

29:24.999 --> 29:26.999
it's... it's just, I like big
things.

29:26.999 --> 29:29.999
Right now, Scott is
visiting his kids.

29:29.999 --> 29:33.999
As much as I would love to be in
New York with all my kids, I'm

29:33.999 --> 29:36.999
really glad that I could be here
in L.A. and be a safety net to

29:36.999 --> 29:38.999
help check on Scott and just
make sure everything's okay with

29:38.999 --> 29:42.999
him and the kids.
Kourtney can relax and know that

29:42.999 --> 29:45.999
I'll handle it.
She really needs to focus on the

29:45.999 --> 29:47.999
- app launch.
- So there-there

29:47.999 --> 29:50.999
is a piece that I worked a long
time ago.

29:50.999 --> 29:53.999
- It's all the girls. Together.
- No!

29:53.999 --> 29:56.999
- Let me see.
- Me and Thierry worked

29:56.999 --> 29:58.999
- together, in collaboration.
Uh-huh.

29:58.999 --> 30:01.999
And Thierry comes to
me and he says, "We have to work

30:01.999 --> 30:04.000
something on the Kardashians."
On the girls.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.999
And one day, you come
up and he says, "Why don't we go

30:07.999 --> 30:11.000
back in time, instead of going
in the future with them?"

30:11.000 --> 30:14.999
Uh-oh.

30:14.999 --> 30:17.999
- Oh, my goodness.
- That's good art.

30:17.999 --> 30:21.999
- That is so crazy.
- Yeah, that looks good.

30:21.999 --> 30:23.999
Look how pretty

30:23.999 --> 30:26.999
Kourtney looks.
And Khloe... like, "You bitches

30:26.999 --> 30:28.999
better take the picture now,
'cause I'm not sitting here

30:28.999 --> 30:30.999
anymore."

30:30.999 --> 30:33.999
I can't believe...
I gotta give you a hug for doing

30:33.999 --> 30:35.999
that.
That is so amazing.

30:35.999 --> 30:41.999
You're so cute.
Oh, my God.

30:41.999 --> 30:44.999
- Do you have the Kanye one or no?
- It's done long

30:44.999 --> 30:46.999
- time ago.
- All your dreams.

30:46.999 --> 30:50.000
It was a old
one, like 2008. There.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.999
- Oh, my God.
- Everything

30:52.999 --> 30:57.999
- that you see is records.
- I'm just trying to

30:57.999 --> 31:00.999
think, did Kanye... is he... did
he have records?

31:00.999 --> 31:03.999
CDs, man.
He did make it to CDs, but he's

31:03.999 --> 31:05.999
not that old.

31:05.999 --> 31:07.999
I don't know, I'm,
like, trying to do the math

31:07.999 --> 31:09.999
really quick in my mind.
But I don't know when it

31:09.999 --> 31:18.999
switched over.♪ ♪

you here, because I got the soup

I just thought about it and I

31:41.999 --> 31:43.999
- was like, how annoying.
- You know what?

31:43.999 --> 31:45.000
- You don't come that often...

You send me to 4th... 4th

Avenue, and there's no 4th
Avenue in New York.

31:54.999 --> 31:56.999
Jonathan is such a good

31:56.999 --> 31:58.999
friend.
I never want to upset him.

I didn't even realize what I was
saying and I just feel really

32:01.999 --> 32:04.999
bad and I want to do whatever I
can to make it up to him.

32:04.999 --> 32:08.999
I love you and I appreciate you
so much and everything that you

32:08.999 --> 32:09.999
- do for me.
- This speech is such

32:09.999 --> 32:12.999
a broken record.
I feel like you've said this

32:12.999 --> 32:13.999
every time and you still do
this.

32:13.999 --> 32:16.999
Yeah, no, I'm over it.
This time, I just, like, I felt

32:16.999 --> 32:18.999
- bad.
- Yeah.

32:18.999 --> 32:20.999
- Why, the other times you didn't?
- No.

32:20.999 --> 32:22.999
The other times, it was, like,
funny.

32:22.999 --> 32:23.999
I'm gonna
cut you soon, for doing this

32:23.999 --> 32:27.999
to me.

Oh, I'm so sorry.
I can't bend over...

how to love someone and stop
taking on all their baggage and

their problems.
And so for Kourtney to finally

33:30.999 --> 33:32.999
set some boundaries and say,
"No, I need a little space, I

33:32.999 --> 33:35.999
need to grow and evolve on my
own," I'm really proud of her.

33:35.999 --> 33:37.999

like, "Yeah"?

33:58.999 --> 34:00.000
many welcome to New York times,

How's it been?
Has it been weird in the house

34:12.999 --> 34:13.999
without him?
You know who.

34:13.999 --> 34:16.999
Uh... I don't know.
It's just trying to, like,

34:16.999 --> 34:19.999
figure out just how to, like,
manage life.

34:19.999 --> 34:23.999
First, I was like, "Come over
whenever you want, anytime.

34:23.999 --> 34:27.999
You could have breakfast,
dinner, watch them swim, play

34:27.999 --> 34:29.999
piano, like, whatever you want
to do."

34:29.999 --> 34:32.999
But then that wasn't really
working, so now it's like, we

34:32.999 --> 34:34.999
have, like, "This is what you
need to do.

34:34.999 --> 34:36.999
You need to come when you say
you're gonna come."

34:36.999 --> 34:40.999
We're trying that, so I'm trying
to see how that goes.

Do you feel like you
would want him back in your life

at all?

- Kardashian...
- I'm excited for our

34:52.999 --> 34:55.999
panel.
It's a big step for me to do

34:55.999 --> 34:57.999
- this.
- All right,

34:57.999 --> 34:59.999
- models, line up.
- I get nervous to do a

34:59.999 --> 35:02.999
show like this, because I'm not
a model and I don't think of

35:02.999 --> 35:09.999
- myself as a model.
- We're gonna start soon.

35:09.999 --> 35:12.999
Do you feel like you
would want him back in your life

35:12.999 --> 35:13.999
at all?

35:16.999 --> 35:21.999
Not right now.
Like, I don't know if there's a

35:21.999 --> 35:24.999
day when, like, Scott would get
it together and be changed and

35:24.999 --> 35:29.999
someone I can depend on like a
partner, but he's just not...

35:29.999 --> 35:31.999
- none of those things right now.
- But are you gonna

35:31.999 --> 35:32.999
- wait, like, that long?
- No.

35:32.999 --> 35:33.999
Are you not gonna,
like, date anybody ever again?

35:33.999 --> 35:35.999
No, I'm not
waiting.

35:35.999 --> 35:39.999
I love Scott, but I've gotten to
a place where I'm just living

35:39.999 --> 35:43.999
life again.
And I need to separate myself,

35:43.999 --> 35:49.999
because every time I carry his
problems on my shoulders, I

35:49.999 --> 35:52.999
physically, like, can't keep
doing it.

35:52.999 --> 35:55.999
Scott really needs to help
himself.

35:55.999 --> 35:59.000
- And I need to focus on myself.
- We need to get you on a

35:59.000 --> 36:01.000
date.
That's the next step.

36:01.000 --> 36:02.999
Yeah, but I don't
think I want to go

exists?

38:29.999 --> 38:32.999
I think it's just having that
go-to place.

38:32.999 --> 38:35.999
That, like, this is my voice.
This is what I want to share

38:35.999 --> 38:38.999
with the world.
Any difference that we can make

38:38.999 --> 38:41.999

always important to us.

38:41.999 --> 38:44.999
Typically at public
speaking engagements, Kourtney

38:44.999 --> 38:49.000
is the most mute.
So I am super proud of her for

38:49.000 --> 38:53.000
- actually having a voice today.
- Kylie loves her makeup.

38:53.000 --> 38:58.999
And Kourtney has this whole mom
life that's so inspiring.

38:58.999 --> 39:01.999
- And Khloe with her fitness.
- I just feel like this

39:01.999 --> 39:04.999
is the start of a really
dope-ass venture together.

39:19.999 --> 39:23.999
Kourtney and I are on
our way to...

39:23.999 --> 39:27.999
- Kanye's show.
- Kanye's show, Yeezy

39:27.999 --> 39:30.999
Season 2; it's Yeezy Season.
We're running late, but what's

39:30.999 --> 39:32.999
- new?
- Get back!

39:32.999 --> 39:34.999
Take one step back!
One step back!

39:41.999 --> 39:44.999
Kylie's walking in
Kanye's Yeezy Season 2 fashion

39:44.999 --> 39:47.999
show.
And I'm really nervous for her.

39:47.999 --> 39:51.999
You know, I think that Kanye's
very specific on who he picks.

39:51.999 --> 39:54.999
I know he puts in so much work
just making sure that

39:54.999 --> 39:58.999
everything's perfect.

39:58.999 --> 40:01.999
Wait, get her nose in
the shadow.

40:01.999 --> 40:03.999
All right, models, line
up.

40:03.999 --> 40:06.999
I get nervous to do a
show like this, because I'm not

40:06.999 --> 40:09.999
a model and I don't think of
myself as a model.

40:09.999 --> 40:12.000
But it's really important for me
to show Kanye I can handle this

40:12.000 --> 40:14.999
- and do a good job.
- Anyone dressed, go to

40:14.999 --> 40:23.999
the lineup.
We're gonna start soon.

40:32.999 --> 40:38.999
- We're gonna start soon.
- First row, fall in.

41:03.999 --> 41:06.999
Fashion Week was so
amazing.

41:06.999 --> 41:08.999
And it means so much to me to be
in Kanye's show.

41:08.999 --> 41:11.999
And especially, the second year
in a row.

41:21.999 --> 41:24.999
Good job!

41:24.999 --> 41:28.999
- We're gonna say bye to Yeezus.
- Okay.

41:28.999 --> 41:30.999
So sick!
Sorry I have to go.

41:30.999 --> 41:32.999
It's all good.
Thank you so much.

41:32.999 --> 41:40.999
It was so dope.♪ ♪

41:40.999 --> 41:43.999
Kylie, you did so
good today.

41:43.999 --> 41:45.999
- Thanks, Khloe.
- I'm so proud of you.

41:45.999 --> 41:47.999
And you were just so dope and
strong.

41:47.999 --> 41:50.999
See, I told...
She's such a model, no one even

41:50.999 --> 41:53.999
knows-- she just blends in.
She blends in.

41:53.999 --> 41:56.999
Her second year and
second season in a row!

41:56.999 --> 41:59.999
Go, Kylie!

41:59.999 --> 42:02.999
All I did was take a
few steps.

42:02.999 --> 42:07.999
But, Kylie, you do it,
Kylie, you do it well.

42:07.999 --> 42:09.999
It has to be scary and
intimidating up there.

42:09.999 --> 42:12.999
And I think Kylie did an awesome
job.

42:12.999 --> 42:17.999
I want her momentum to continue
and increase, but I want her to

42:17.999 --> 42:21.999
remain humble and incredibly
grateful for every opportunity

42:21.999 --> 42:24.999
- she gets.
- What did you guys

42:24.999 --> 42:26.999
think of Kanye's show?
Wasn't it so inspiring?

42:26.999 --> 42:29.999
- It was great.
- Like, it, like,

42:29.999 --> 42:31.999
doesn't it make you just want to
dress like that every day?

42:31.999 --> 42:33.999
- Totally.
- It makes you want

42:33.999 --> 42:35.999
to literally get rid of
everything in your closet and

42:35.999 --> 42:37.999
- just have that.
- All color.

42:37.999 --> 42:40.999
Yeah, yeah.
I just feel like this trip

42:40.999 --> 42:42.999
actually got me really excited
about my app.

42:42.999 --> 42:46.999
You don't say!

42:46.999 --> 42:49.999
I'm so happy that I
came to New York with everyone.

42:49.999 --> 42:53.999
I think if I wouldn't have come,
I would've had major FOMO.

42:53.999 --> 42:57.999
And just having that sister
time, like, all of us in New

42:57.999 --> 43:00.999
York City, we just haven't done
this in forever.

43:00.999 --> 43:02.999
Okay, love you guys.
Bye.

43:02.999 --> 43:06.999
- Love you. Safe flight.
- You guys?

43:06.999 --> 43:09.999
Everyone be real.
Kendall, thanks for paying for

43:09.999 --> 43:11.999
- the food.
- Screw you.

43:11.999 --> 43:13.999
- Bye, guys.
- Bye, you guys.

43:13.999 --> 43:15.999
- Bye, love you guys.
- Bitches ain't.

43:15.999 --> 43:18.999
Remember that.

43:18.999 --> 43:20.999
On the next episode of
Keeping Up with the Kardashians

43:20.999 --> 43:22.999
Good, good.
That's like a  painting.

43:22.999 --> 43:24.999
- Yeah.
- Boom!

43:24.999 --> 43:27.999
I miss, like, doing
stuff with Dad that, like, we

43:27.999 --> 43:29.999
used to always do, the boyish
things.

43:29.999 --> 43:33.999
If you're upset with
changes that have gone on, I

43:33.999 --> 43:36.999
- want you to talk directly to me.
- You don't care if you

43:36.999 --> 43:38.999
possibly could get breast
cancer?

43:38.999 --> 43:40.999
Fact-- I'm going to
die.

43:40.999 --> 43:41.999
Do you want to die
when you're 30?!

43:41.999 --> 43:43.999
I really don't care
when I die.

43:43.999 --> 43:46.999
You don't care?
