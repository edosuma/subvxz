00:01.001 --> 00:02.127
Constance is gone.

00:02.127 --> 00:03.503
The train has to come
to a stop at crossings.

00:03.503 --> 00:06.089
- It could be any of these four.
- Go time.

00:06.089 --> 00:09.134
<i>The Whisperer.
Someone is rebuilding it.</i>

00:09.134 --> 00:11.094
<i>It's so nice to have you back.</i>

00:11.094 --> 00:13.388
Is this how you picture your future self?

00:13.388 --> 00:15.348
- Life could be better.
- I said stop!

00:15.348 --> 00:17.267
Tire tracks. Different tires?

00:17.267 --> 00:19.102
- This must be the car.
- Check it out.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.395
Looks like an old root cellar.

00:20.395 --> 00:21.354
<i>Curtain's Gray.</i>

00:23.189 --> 00:24.941
- Treat them without mercy.
- <i>Understood.</i>

00:25.608 --> 00:28.528
This whole happiness technique of his,
I invented it.

00:28.528 --> 00:30.488
<i>Then when I refused to use my technique,</i>

00:30.488 --> 00:34.034
<i>knowing how dangerous
the side effects could be, he fired me.</i>

00:34.034 --> 00:35.326
<i>I have a plan to get us out of here.</i>

00:35.326 --> 00:36.745
And I'm fairly certain
that he'll choose to stay.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.163
You saw him out there?

00:38.163 --> 00:40.915
<i>I have finally earned his trust.
I have his ear.</i>

00:40.915 --> 00:43.793
You don't have to leave your brother.
We're gonna kidnap him.

00:45.211 --> 00:46.421
Constance!

00:46.421 --> 00:47.797
- We're getting you out of here.
- Restrain them.

00:47.797 --> 00:50.300
It's time to boot up the Brainsweeper.

00:53.178 --> 00:54.888
This can be friendly.

00:54.888 --> 00:59.476
Yes, we're just going to very gently
apply some handcuffs.

01:02.145 --> 01:03.313
What is that?

01:03.313 --> 01:05.857
Spread out!

01:24.084 --> 01:26.211
- Rhonda.
- Rhonda.

01:26.211 --> 01:30.340
Not who I was expecting to find here,
but I'll take it.

01:31.132 --> 01:34.677
Rhonda, we're sorry for running off
without telling you.

01:34.677 --> 01:36.387
Stay in the now, Reynie.

01:36.387 --> 01:39.015
We are safe, and we are together.

01:39.724 --> 01:43.436
- Is that a clove hitch knot?
- Modified constrictor.

01:43.436 --> 01:44.813
Classic.

01:44.813 --> 01:46.689
You proud of yourself?

01:46.689 --> 01:48.233
Loaded question.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.859
Self-esteem issues.

01:49.859 --> 01:51.861
In an ideal world,

01:51.861 --> 01:57.534
I could have just invited Constance
to help me for the sake of science.

01:58.409 --> 02:00.328
Where is Dr. Curtain?

02:01.412 --> 02:04.040
You and I, we have the same aims.

02:04.040 --> 02:07.335
- Brain experimentation?
- To bring Curtain down.

02:08.128 --> 02:13.091
He's the reason I live like this.
A basement dweller, a troglodyte.

02:15.677 --> 02:18.221
Let me go,
and I'll tell you exactly where he is.

02:18.221 --> 02:20.890
I'll tell you everything I know.

02:22.350 --> 02:25.520
- You okay with this, Constance?
- It's fine.

02:25.520 --> 02:28.857
No one can punish her more
than she punishes herself.

02:28.857 --> 02:30.817
- That's true.
- Okay.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.110
Deal.

02:33.611 --> 02:34.779
Where is Curtain?

02:34.779 --> 02:36.573
Northern Italy.

02:37.240 --> 02:39.325
A small village just north of Vernazza.

02:39.325 --> 02:41.995
His compound is hidden
within lemon groves.

02:43.621 --> 02:44.873
Thank you, Doctor.

02:46.457 --> 02:50.753
Uh, we are independent contractors.
No skin in the game.

02:50.753 --> 02:53.923
- Not at all.
- Open to a buyout.

02:55.967 --> 02:57.135
What was that?

02:57.760 --> 02:59.095
This way.

03:00.805 --> 03:01.806
The Grays!

03:01.806 --> 03:03.433
- Get back.
- Oh, no.

03:16.821 --> 03:17.655
Hello.

03:18.990 --> 03:21.701
I had to close the distance
pretty fast there at the end.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.955
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

03:26.789 --> 03:27.999
How did you find us?

03:27.999 --> 03:29.626
After we disarmed the Grays in Germany,

03:29.626 --> 03:32.253
we learned that there were several units
sent after you.

03:32.253 --> 03:34.589
We decrypted
a few of their coded telegraphs,

03:34.589 --> 03:35.632
and found this address.

03:39.969 --> 03:41.429
We've been followed.

03:42.180 --> 03:44.933
That way.
If we get separated, don't slow down.

03:44.933 --> 03:46.643
I'll take the bike, you others in the van.

03:46.643 --> 03:48.144
- Yes?
- Run!

03:50.688 --> 03:52.815
- Halt! Halt! Halt!
- Stop right there!

03:52.815 --> 03:54.901
Go, go, let's go!

03:58.613 --> 04:00.198
Get those two.

04:00.198 --> 04:02.158
- Sticky!
- Ms. Perumal!

04:02.158 --> 04:04.702
- Constance!
- Reynie, stay with Rhonda.

04:05.828 --> 04:07.330
Stop her now!

04:13.086 --> 04:14.379
Take me.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.312
Dad!

04:31.813 --> 04:34.065
- Wait, the others.
- Where are they?

04:34.065 --> 04:36.776
Ms. Perumal's with Sticky and Constance.
Rhonda's with Reynie.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.945
- Just drive.
- Then we go.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.409
- Where's Sticky and Constance?
- They're with Ms. Perumal.

04:44.409 --> 04:46.369
- Did they get to the van?
- I don't know.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.018
Keep eye contact.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.354
Nice.

05:55.730 --> 05:56.939
And again.

05:56.939 --> 05:58.733
Do not rush.

05:58.733 --> 06:01.819
The time is your own. Breathe in.

06:03.905 --> 06:05.531
And out.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.787
Breathe in... and out.

06:10.787 --> 06:11.954
Good.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.792
Ah. Nicholas.

06:17.001 --> 06:19.754
- What a nice surprise.
- Yes, I was...

06:19.754 --> 06:22.507
I was just taking a twi-night stroll.

06:22.507 --> 06:26.219
- Twi-night.
- You know, it's duskish.

06:27.136 --> 06:30.390
-"The hour of the owl," they say.
- Who says that exactly?

06:30.390 --> 06:33.768
You know. One wordsmith or another, huh?

06:33.768 --> 06:35.186
Thank you, Laila.

06:35.186 --> 06:36.562
Can I help you with something?

06:37.271 --> 06:40.483
No, I was, we're in such close proximity,

06:40.483 --> 06:42.985
I was anxious to hear more from you.

06:44.445 --> 06:47.824
I feel like I've only scratched
the surface of your work.

06:48.449 --> 06:49.450
How is Number Two?

06:49.450 --> 06:53.079
Oh, she doesn't really see the point
of what you're doing here.

06:53.913 --> 06:55.998
Or agree with it, rather, but...

06:57.917 --> 06:59.710
- Nicholas.
- Hm?

06:59.710 --> 07:03.381
There are people in this world
who simply do not want to be happy.

07:04.090 --> 07:07.885
Please be careful of them.
They can weigh you down.

07:07.885 --> 07:10.972
No. Number Two does not
weigh me down. No, she...

07:10.972 --> 07:12.223
Lifts you up.

07:13.349 --> 07:15.601
She doesn't weigh me down, so...

07:17.061 --> 07:19.063
That's for you to say. Not me.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.526
Well, I do not want
to be a burden anymore.

07:24.235 --> 07:26.487
I'll let you get back
to your very important work.

07:27.780 --> 07:29.740
Um... Good night.

07:30.783 --> 07:33.035
- Good night.
- Yes.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.622
Oh, yes.

07:38.416 --> 07:42.211
Auguste? I have a task for you.

07:48.301 --> 07:52.847
Oh, so, did you find anything
in Curtain's office?

07:52.847 --> 07:56.851
Schematics, plans?
Evidence that we can use to expose him?

07:57.602 --> 08:00.480
You know, I...
I don't think it's something

08:00.605 --> 08:03.524
so technical or detectable. It's...

08:04.650 --> 08:08.821
I think it's more intangible,
and personal, actually.

08:09.489 --> 08:10.781
You almost sound excited.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.283
Oh, hm...

08:12.783 --> 08:15.286
No matter. We proceed
with the kidnapping as planned.

08:15.620 --> 08:18.748
So, we start by you...

08:18.748 --> 08:20.791
- Oh, look at this.
- Don't touch that.

08:21.542 --> 08:22.668
- All to scale.
- Yes.

08:22.668 --> 08:27.215
We'll start by having you lure Curtain
away from his sea of followers,

08:27.215 --> 08:28.799
back here to the bungalow.

08:29.133 --> 08:31.552
He will arrive
to find evening tea set for two.

08:31.552 --> 08:33.387
- Lovely.
- Do not drink the tea.

08:33.387 --> 08:35.056
- Oh.
- The tea will contain

08:35.056 --> 08:37.016
a trace amount of this.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.769
Translucidus sominferum.

08:39.769 --> 08:43.773
Or, as it's referred to
in Nordic folklore, "duskwort."

08:43.773 --> 08:47.860
A rare but powerful sedative
that can immobilize an elephant.

08:48.402 --> 08:50.947
Once he's out,
you will dress in his clothing.

08:50.947 --> 08:52.240
It'll be a tight fit.

08:52.240 --> 08:54.450
Oh, I don't think
we're that much different in size.

08:54.450 --> 08:56.702
- Practice sharp, shallow breathing.
- How?

08:56.702 --> 08:59.705
Then, we cut your hair. Snip.

09:00.373 --> 09:02.583
Please save all commentary till the end.

09:02.583 --> 09:05.211
The two of you
will look unnervingly alike.

09:05.211 --> 09:08.256
We'll place your unconscious brother
in the back of a cart,

09:08.256 --> 09:12.134
escape through this entrance,
and make our way to the safe house.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.221
Oh, I hope.

09:21.269 --> 09:22.645
Now is the time for feedback.

09:23.771 --> 09:28.025
Yes, well, it is thorough.

09:28.734 --> 09:31.946
- Cutting the hair, though.
- Oh, there's no workaround.

09:34.073 --> 09:35.157
All right.

09:37.285 --> 09:38.619
I know it needs to be done.

09:38.619 --> 09:40.913
Good. Are you prepared to do it?

09:46.544 --> 09:48.296
We never should have agreed to separate.

09:48.296 --> 09:50.256
The Grays aren't going to stop
looking for us.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.300
It was the only way, Kate.

09:52.300 --> 09:54.552
Even if we were captured,
at least we would be together.

09:54.552 --> 09:59.098
With no one to effect a rescue.
We are all going to the same place.

09:59.098 --> 10:00.558
We will meet there.

10:00.558 --> 10:04.729
- Never split the team. Ever.
- Interesting.

10:04.729 --> 10:06.981
- Considering the source.
- What?

10:06.981 --> 10:10.401
There was a time that you felt like
the team was holding you back.

10:10.401 --> 10:12.361
I would call this growth.

10:12.361 --> 10:15.865
- Profound growth.
- You are so frustrating.

10:15.865 --> 10:17.116
- Ha!
- Okay!

10:17.116 --> 10:20.661
I can't concentrate with all this drama.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.248
I'm formulating a plan.

10:43.100 --> 10:44.560
It's the spark plug.

10:46.896 --> 10:50.483
A challenge, yes, but we'll be fine.

10:52.193 --> 10:53.361
Will we?

10:54.528 --> 10:56.322
This feels like the end of the road.

10:59.241 --> 11:02.244
I'm sorry. I'm not helping.

11:02.244 --> 11:03.913
Don't apologize.

11:03.913 --> 11:06.499
If you're feeling something,
it's okay, say it.

11:07.750 --> 11:08.751
Okay.

11:10.336 --> 11:11.796
I guess I feel...

11:14.006 --> 11:15.257
afraid.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.553
That's reasonable.

11:20.137 --> 11:21.347
And tired.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.099
This has been tiring.

11:23.099 --> 11:24.392
And hot.

11:25.434 --> 11:27.645
- What else?
- And...

11:29.021 --> 11:30.189
angry.

11:31.941 --> 11:34.610
- Angry at what?
- Myself.

11:34.902 --> 11:36.570
I messed up everything.

11:36.570 --> 11:38.030
Hm.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.658
I should have listened to Kate and Sticky.

11:40.658 --> 11:45.621
Even Constance knew we'd be
taken advantage of, scammed, kidnapped,

11:45.621 --> 11:48.874
- but I didn't listen.
- More. Louder!

11:48.874 --> 11:51.794
- Everything is wrong!
-"Everything?" Get specific.

11:51.794 --> 11:53.379
Nothing is fair!

11:53.379 --> 11:55.172
Curtain's being called a hero,

11:55.172 --> 11:58.259
and Mr. Benedict is gone,
and so is Number Two.

11:58.259 --> 12:03.264
And I'm so confused
because I don't know what I'm doing!

12:13.190 --> 12:14.692
How did that feel?

12:16.944 --> 12:18.195
Good.

12:20.114 --> 12:23.617
Strange. But good.

12:36.881 --> 12:39.467
DELUCCI'S CHICKENS

12:58.444 --> 13:00.488
This is child abandonment.

13:00.488 --> 13:01.614
You'll be fined.

13:08.496 --> 13:11.999
- This is bleak.
- It could be worse.

13:12.583 --> 13:15.294
- How?
- The Grays could catch up to us.

13:19.089 --> 13:20.716
Let's go find a town.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.654
Your hat.

14:00.756 --> 14:01.841
Weird.

14:09.807 --> 14:11.767
Okay. Enough.

14:13.978 --> 14:14.812
There.

14:30.369 --> 14:33.956
- Hello.
- Oh, guests.

14:33.956 --> 14:37.459
- What a joy.
- Oh, yes, come in, come in.

14:38.460 --> 14:42.006
Oh, poor things. Must be freezing.

14:49.555 --> 14:55.144
I am, Yanis, and this is Sofia,
and welcome to our House of Hygge.

14:55.144 --> 14:58.772
-"Hygge?"
- Yes, it's a Danish way of life.

14:58.772 --> 15:02.526
- A commitment to all things cozy.
- Hospitality is our life.

15:02.526 --> 15:04.194
I thought you sounded Danish.

15:04.194 --> 15:07.489
Well, our original location in Copenhagen,

15:08.157 --> 15:11.076
um, was consumed by fire.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.579
Ravaged by it.

15:14.330 --> 15:19.501
Uh, perhaps we flew too high
and our competitors took note.

15:20.127 --> 15:22.212
"Inconclusive, inconclusive," they said.

15:22.546 --> 15:28.469
But regardless, we relocated here
to Sofia's home village,

15:28.469 --> 15:31.805
and we continue the journey of comfort.

15:33.515 --> 15:37.144
Are you enjoying your shawls?
Yanis knit them himself.

15:37.144 --> 15:39.396
From the yarn spun
by his great-grandmother.

15:39.396 --> 15:42.149
How much truth do you want?

15:46.862 --> 15:50.449
What brings you to our inn?

15:50.449 --> 15:53.077
Yes. Will your parents be joining?

15:53.077 --> 15:56.664
We're exchange students from overseas.

15:56.664 --> 16:00.918
Um, we got here on travel grant
for research from the Boatwright Academy.

16:00.918 --> 16:06.423
Um, well, we cannot wait
to hear about all things boat.

16:07.591 --> 16:12.137
But for now, the kitchen,
because as you can smell,

16:12.137 --> 16:14.264
we have something very,
very exciting on the horizon.

16:14.264 --> 16:15.557
Um-hm.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.226
But for now, relax.

16:17.226 --> 16:21.522
Settle at your own pace,
and as we say <i>"kan du hygge dig".</i>

16:21.522 --> 16:24.525
Have fun, cozy yourself, huh?

16:24.525 --> 16:26.777
We leave you. Come.

16:31.281 --> 16:33.450
We must flee this place.

16:39.915 --> 16:41.000
Yeah.

16:45.337 --> 16:48.090
- Curtain.
- We've done it, sir. We have her.

16:48.090 --> 16:51.593
- Who?
- One of your brother's top attachés.

16:51.593 --> 16:56.348
An elusive woman
using the name, or alias, Perumal.

16:56.348 --> 16:59.393
Says she's a school teacher.

16:59.393 --> 17:01.103
Ludicrous cover,
saw through it right away.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.855
Please don't aggrandize.

17:03.605 --> 17:05.983
This Perumal sounds like
a mid-level operative, at best.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.068
What about the children?

17:08.068 --> 17:11.321
- We haven't found them.
-"We?"

17:12.948 --> 17:15.868
- I haven't found them.
- Then do it.

17:16.910 --> 17:20.372
Yes, sir, I will. I definitely will.

17:20.372 --> 17:24.209
But again, let's not overlook
the potential critical piece

17:24.209 --> 17:26.503
this so-called Perumal represents. She--

17:33.427 --> 17:35.054
Be better.

17:42.019 --> 17:43.520
- We're interrupting.
- Regret it.

17:43.520 --> 17:46.815
- So much.
- News so good, it can't wait, I trust?

17:58.660 --> 18:00.621
How long have they been like this?

18:00.621 --> 18:03.207
- Some, just a few hours.
- Others, days.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.375
We've been handling Marlon's duties
in his absence.

18:05.375 --> 18:07.878
- Happy to do it, of course.
- Seamless transition into the role.

18:07.878 --> 18:10.047
I think we have a real knack for it,
going forward.

18:10.047 --> 18:11.256
Separate conversation.

18:11.757 --> 18:13.425
They're not moving.

18:13.926 --> 18:16.428
There's a small chance
this is a repercussion of the program.

18:16.428 --> 18:19.139
The methodology. A side effect.

18:21.183 --> 18:22.684
It's not possible.

18:22.684 --> 18:24.061
- That's what we said.
- That's what we said.

18:24.061 --> 18:27.189
That is completely unfounded.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.817
If anything,
what we're seeing is an anomaly.

18:29.817 --> 18:34.279
A manifestation of a few loyal,
yet unprepared individuals.

18:35.781 --> 18:39.535
And ethically, their medical condition
cannot be shared with the others.

18:39.535 --> 18:42.246
Yes? So, hush, hush.

18:42.246 --> 18:43.956
For their privacy.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.833
- We completely agree.
- It's just that,

18:47.000 --> 18:49.545
- well...
- Speak freely.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.257
There's a chemical misfire
in their brains.

18:53.257 --> 18:56.468
Dr. Vanderburg suggested
this might be irreversible.

18:58.387 --> 19:00.681
No. I don't trust this doctor.

19:01.348 --> 19:02.641
Find another one.

19:05.185 --> 19:08.605
- But I think it might work.
- No, no, no.

19:08.605 --> 19:11.275
No. Absolutely not.

19:11.275 --> 19:12.818
It's a great plan.

19:12.818 --> 19:15.779
Or I could enter alone in disguise.

19:15.779 --> 19:18.991
You and Martina could go somewhere safe,
and wait for the others.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.704
Is this the silence of consensus?

19:24.288 --> 19:26.039
I don't need protecting.

19:26.039 --> 19:28.292
Kate, you, you are smart.

19:28.292 --> 19:33.088
You are unbelievably quick on your feet,
but you need to be more careful.

19:33.088 --> 19:34.756
I am careful!

19:34.756 --> 19:37.718
You fell off a cliff. Carefully?

19:37.718 --> 19:39.178
I had it under control.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.388
I'm not always gonna be there to save you.

19:41.388 --> 19:43.140
No one's asking you to!

19:43.599 --> 19:45.893
I was alone for a really long time.

19:46.435 --> 19:48.687
I had to learn to take care of myself.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.480
And then you just showed up!

19:56.695 --> 19:58.488
Hey, body fuel.

19:58.488 --> 20:01.450
From here on out, it's nonstop,
fourth-quarter madness.

20:03.327 --> 20:05.120
Are we good?

20:05.120 --> 20:07.581
I need you both in top mental
and physical condition.

20:08.373 --> 20:09.374
Yeah.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.501
Have you done everything you can
to prepare to win?

20:11.501 --> 20:12.711
Yes.

20:12.711 --> 20:14.838
Are we prepared to win?

20:15.714 --> 20:17.758
Yeah!

20:28.685 --> 20:30.062
Once the rain lets up,

20:30.062 --> 20:32.356
I'll see if Yanis or Sofia
can give us a ride.

20:35.025 --> 20:39.780
My world-famous lingonberry scones.

20:39.780 --> 20:41.406
Fresh from the oven.

21:03.303 --> 21:05.305
The crumb isn't right, is it?

21:08.558 --> 21:09.476
Uh...

21:09.476 --> 21:11.103
Your dough was too wet.

21:12.980 --> 21:17.276
Well, I'll just, I'll just fashion
something more to your liking.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.653
Something prepackaged
may be more reliable.

21:21.780 --> 21:25.450
Would you, would you just excuse me
for just, just a moment?

21:25.450 --> 21:27.411
Just for one moment.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.330
He looked like he was about to cry.

21:30.330 --> 21:32.040
His tears will lead to growth.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.042
- Constance.
- What?

21:34.042 --> 21:36.670
We should you give up our standards
to preserve his psyche?

21:36.670 --> 21:39.631
Yes. What if they could help us?
Give us a ride.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.301
You just torpedoed that
because you didn't like his scone?

21:42.301 --> 21:43.719
It was not good.

21:43.719 --> 21:45.721
You don't have to say
everything you're thinking.

21:45.721 --> 21:47.389
You're so selfish!

22:05.824 --> 22:07.326
<i>Now in diet!</i>

22:08.910 --> 22:12.122
<i>Welcome back. I'm so happy to see you.</i>

22:13.915 --> 22:16.835
<i>Doesn't it feel good to be seen?</i>

22:16.835 --> 22:20.839
<i>Let's resume this journey together.</i>

22:21.673 --> 22:24.343
<i>Negative thoughts only cloud the mind,</i>

22:24.343 --> 22:28.638
<i>preventing you from experiencing
what you duly deserve.</i>

22:29.431 --> 22:32.017
<i>True happiness.</i>

22:32.642 --> 22:35.520
<i>Once you unburden yourself from worry,</i>

22:35.520 --> 22:40.150
<i>self-doubt, sadness, and disillusionment,</i>

22:40.692 --> 22:44.363
<i>your life will blossom
to its full potential,</i>

22:44.780 --> 22:48.950
<i>filled with unbridled joy.</i>

22:53.789 --> 22:57.125
There. Front gate. That's the goal.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.880
Are you sure you want to do this?

23:01.880 --> 23:05.008
- What if something goes wrong?
- Can't plan for everything.

23:05.008 --> 23:07.344
Could I predict Elena
would start instead of me?

23:07.344 --> 23:09.888
No one could. Because it makes no sense.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.932
I get the politics,
she's a total underdog story,

23:11.932 --> 23:13.892
but she's got no backhand.

23:15.769 --> 23:19.689
Look, this could go pear-shaped
in eight different ways.

23:19.689 --> 23:24.111
But no matter what goes down,
I'm glad we got to hang out again.

23:25.904 --> 23:27.114
Me too.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.827
<i>Madge's Honor. This is Fallen Comet.</i>

23:31.827 --> 23:33.745
<i>I've arrived at the rendezvous point.</i>

23:34.454 --> 23:37.249
- Copy. How's it looking?
<i>- Security is light.</i>

23:37.249 --> 23:39.209
<i>There's a small window of opportunity.</i>

23:39.751 --> 23:42.421
<i>- Right now, if I went in alone, I...</i>
- Negative.

23:42.421 --> 23:45.424
The better plan involves the three of us.
You agreed to it.

23:45.424 --> 23:48.510
<i>Right. Sorry. Proceed as planned.</i>

23:48.510 --> 23:49.719
<i>Over.</i>

23:49.719 --> 23:54.558
<i>But standing by if you need me
while also giving you space.</i>

23:57.310 --> 24:00.272
- He's just worried.
- You're taking his side?

24:00.939 --> 24:03.942
Look, my parents are nice people.

24:03.942 --> 24:07.028
They have no understanding of the game,
but they're nice.

24:07.654 --> 24:12.159
Are they interested in my life?
Sometimes I don't know.

24:12.159 --> 24:15.704
They don't ask about stuff.
They don't try.

24:17.038 --> 24:18.457
Your dad's trying.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.251
He's interested.

24:24.337 --> 24:26.840
Look. Truck heading in.

24:30.760 --> 24:32.137
It's go time.

24:34.181 --> 24:35.724
See you on the other side.

24:46.526 --> 24:49.529
<i>And you get 40 percent
off our Annual Clearance Sale.</i>

24:49.529 --> 24:50.989
<i>Come in to find huge savings</i>

24:50.989 --> 24:53.074
<i>on the hottest items
of the season only at...</i>

24:58.788 --> 25:00.665
I'm sorry I lost my temper.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.335
I understand.

25:04.294 --> 25:05.128
You do?

25:08.465 --> 25:09.841
Of course.

25:12.469 --> 25:14.012
- You can.
- No, I cannot.

25:14.012 --> 25:16.765
I cannot.
She is, she is breaking me, Sofia.

25:16.765 --> 25:19.518
Okay, deep breaths. We have to try.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.777
Well, I called my cousin

25:28.777 --> 25:31.780
and she will give you a ride
to your destination.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.657
That's wonderful. Thank you.

25:35.534 --> 25:38.370
For your journey, <i>rugbrod</i>?

25:52.342 --> 25:55.095
This is a triumph.

25:56.012 --> 25:58.765
It warms my soul. Thank you.

26:02.185 --> 26:05.939
Well... anything else?

26:05.939 --> 26:09.526
You've done enough.
You're angel sent from heaven.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.486
- Yes.
- Yes.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.863
- Well.
- Thanks.

26:17.617 --> 26:20.495
Constance, are you okay?

26:23.790 --> 26:26.876
Well, one thing is bothering me.

26:26.876 --> 26:30.171
I don't know nearly enough
about Boatwright.

26:30.171 --> 26:33.133
While we wait for our ride,
will you tell me everything?

26:33.717 --> 26:35.677
Where to start?

26:41.057 --> 26:42.225
She's in.

26:43.143 --> 26:44.894
She's very brave.

26:46.187 --> 26:47.439
And a good friend.

26:48.481 --> 26:52.402
- Look, what I said earlier...
- It's okay.

26:52.902 --> 26:54.571
All I wanted was to have you back.

26:55.155 --> 26:56.740
And now that it's happened...

26:58.992 --> 27:00.994
I'm just so used to doing things
on my own.

27:01.536 --> 27:03.913
I don't know. It's so confusing.

27:05.540 --> 27:06.916
I'm confused, too.

27:08.376 --> 27:11.004
But I love you just the way you are.

27:12.297 --> 27:15.634
We'll find our system. That's what we do.

27:16.259 --> 27:17.677
We fix things.

27:31.358 --> 27:32.567
Rhonda.

27:32.567 --> 27:34.736
- Reynie.
- Milligan.

27:37.489 --> 27:40.575
- Where's everyone else?
- Martina's inside.

27:41.159 --> 27:42.494
We thought the others are with you.

27:42.494 --> 27:47.248
Don't worry, Ms. Perumal is fearless.
She's prepared for anything.

27:47.248 --> 27:50.543
They all knew exactly where to go.
We'll see them soon.

27:50.543 --> 27:54.547
So, we supersaturate the solution,
added some dry ice to the coolant,

27:54.547 --> 27:57.384
and pretty much redefined
monothermal extraction.

27:57.384 --> 28:00.637
Wow, Boatwright sounds great.

28:00.637 --> 28:02.055
I know, right?

28:03.014 --> 28:04.599
I'm glad you shared, Sticky.

28:07.602 --> 28:11.439
Wait. Did you just call me "Sticky?"

28:11.439 --> 28:14.859
Of course. That's your name, silly.

28:15.568 --> 28:18.905
Okay. Something's definitely wrong.

28:18.905 --> 28:23.910
<i>Your life will blossom
to its full potential. Filled...</i>

28:23.910 --> 28:25.203
Curtain.

28:25.203 --> 28:27.831
<i>...with unbridled joy.</i>

28:31.334 --> 28:32.168
Found you.

28:32.168 --> 28:37.257
Oh. Don't. The house is surrounded.
Your hosts have been detained.

28:39.509 --> 28:43.763
My failure at the Institute
shattered me as a man.

28:44.931 --> 28:49.728
And it's taken me a long time
to rebuild my self-esteem.

28:49.728 --> 28:52.522
To know deep in my heart

28:53.106 --> 28:56.860
that I can secure a perimeter

28:57.569 --> 28:58.987
like I have done today.

28:58.987 --> 29:01.364
What a delightful amount of detail.

29:01.364 --> 29:03.825
Oh, thank you.

29:05.034 --> 29:07.912
Okay. Time to go.

29:11.416 --> 29:15.086
I was told you urgently needed me.

29:15.086 --> 29:18.548
Yes. I have a pressing question.

29:18.548 --> 29:19.591
Hm.

29:19.591 --> 29:21.926
What did the lion say
when he saw the elephants

29:21.926 --> 29:23.261
coming over the hill?

29:24.304 --> 29:25.930
"Here come the elephants over the hill."

29:25.930 --> 29:29.017
Yes!

29:29.017 --> 29:30.351
I knew you'd remember.

29:30.351 --> 29:33.772
Oh, Headmaster Chiu
loved her elephant jokes.

29:33.772 --> 29:36.691
Oh, yes, she did. She did.

29:37.567 --> 29:38.610
Is that all?

29:39.819 --> 29:42.030
No, that's not all. Um...

29:42.781 --> 29:43.823
That's everything.

29:45.116 --> 29:47.076
I know that it's taken me a moment
to come around,

29:47.076 --> 29:49.788
but what you have given us here
is precious.

29:50.371 --> 29:52.707
Something we haven't had in decades.

29:52.707 --> 29:55.293
Time. Time with each other.

29:56.544 --> 29:58.463
So, thank you. Thank you.

29:59.214 --> 30:00.465
You're welcome, Nicholas.

30:02.175 --> 30:07.555
Now. Let's not waste this gift, no?
Let's have some tea.

30:08.348 --> 30:10.350
This phoenix oolong will change you.

30:11.768 --> 30:12.894
Hm.

30:14.687 --> 30:16.314
I accept the invitation.

30:22.654 --> 30:23.905
Please, sit.

30:27.867 --> 30:30.703
I also have another question for you.

30:32.413 --> 30:34.457
What did the lion say
when he saw the elephants

30:34.457 --> 30:37.085
coming over the hill wearing sunglasses?

30:38.670 --> 30:39.838
I don't know.

30:39.838 --> 30:40.797
Nothing.

30:41.965 --> 30:43.258
He didn't recognize them.

30:51.140 --> 30:52.725
Oh, that's good.

31:00.191 --> 31:02.777
She arrived at the front gate.
Asked to see you two.

31:05.154 --> 31:09.075
Hello, Crowe. Congratulations.

31:09.075 --> 31:11.995
You joined a very exclusive list
of traitors.

31:11.995 --> 31:14.831
- When you betrayed us.
- That's why I'm here.

31:14.831 --> 31:17.166
- To apologize.
- To Dr. Curtain?

31:17.166 --> 31:19.252
Won't see you. Extremely busy.

31:19.252 --> 31:21.379
No. To you.

31:21.963 --> 31:25.508
Look, you put your reputations on the line
by recommending me for the Institute,

31:25.508 --> 31:27.802
and I threw it all away. For what?

31:28.636 --> 31:31.180
I've been carrying this... guilt.

31:31.931 --> 31:33.850
I want to earn your forgiveness.

31:35.018 --> 31:37.353
Are you actually here for redemption?

31:38.354 --> 31:40.064
Or are you looking for a hideout?

31:43.401 --> 31:45.570
I'm not afraid of a little time.

31:46.195 --> 31:48.239
I'm afraid for my soul.

31:49.073 --> 31:51.910
You do look... miserable.

31:51.910 --> 31:55.496
- No one has to be that way.
- Not when there's so much happiness.

31:56.789 --> 31:58.499
- We forgive you.
- We forgive you.

32:09.260 --> 32:10.511
There we go.

32:12.722 --> 32:15.808
Wait here.
There's tons of new initiate paperwork.

32:31.491 --> 32:34.243
Mr. Benedict, Number Two,
and Ms. Perumal are here.

32:34.243 --> 32:36.746
And I heard some talk
of some other people being detained.

32:36.746 --> 32:40.792
Two children, whose descriptions
bear striking similarity to our crew.

32:41.459 --> 32:44.462
- That's all I got.
- Great work, Martina.

32:44.921 --> 32:47.715
- Let's move.
- This is where I leave you.

32:49.050 --> 32:51.469
Turns out, the whole van thing
is actually a crime.

32:52.261 --> 32:54.514
Got to get it back before things escalate.

32:55.098 --> 32:58.351
You've done impressive work, eh?
If you ever need a job...

33:01.562 --> 33:02.939
You got this.

33:06.401 --> 33:08.695
I'll see you down the road, friends.

33:16.786 --> 33:17.954
Let's go.

33:24.711 --> 33:27.422
Oh, you're too easy, Nicholas.

33:27.422 --> 33:29.716
I can keep the puns flowing all day.

33:35.555 --> 33:36.889
Well, then.

33:36.889 --> 33:40.184
It's an underrated talent,
pun construction.

33:41.769 --> 33:43.479
It's actually quite complicated. Hello.

33:43.479 --> 33:44.814
Freshen up your tea.

33:44.814 --> 33:46.024
Thank you.

33:47.066 --> 33:49.235
Another one of your treatises.

33:49.235 --> 33:51.195
Oh, it's more of a theory.

33:51.195 --> 33:53.573
It's only just 1,500 words.

33:57.535 --> 33:59.620
Hm. It's good
to have you here, Nicholas.

34:01.581 --> 34:02.957
Yes.

34:17.221 --> 34:18.347
Thank you.

34:21.309 --> 34:23.061
Now.

34:25.438 --> 34:29.275
So much time has been lost between us.

34:35.656 --> 34:39.077
- To new memories.
- To new memories.

34:43.039 --> 34:44.290
Wait.

34:47.210 --> 34:51.380
Just a pinch of sugar
will make that the perfect sip.

34:56.928 --> 34:58.471
What is it now?

35:09.607 --> 35:11.901
- Yes?
- Hello, Mrs. Two.

35:11.901 --> 35:14.028
Number Two. What do you want?

35:15.446 --> 35:17.865
I really need someone to talk to.

35:21.285 --> 35:24.622
Whatever is wrong,
I'm sure it's going to turn out okay.

35:26.874 --> 35:28.126
You're right.

35:33.840 --> 35:35.675
Everything will be okay.
