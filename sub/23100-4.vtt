01:24.541 --> 01:26.833
I'm going for a new world record!

01:26.958 --> 01:30.541
Jay, wait.
Uh, according to my crickto-calculations,

01:30.666 --> 01:33.625
with your take-off velocity
plus wind speed, this is...

01:33.708 --> 01:34.708
Here I come!

01:34.791 --> 01:36.791
...certain disaster.

01:39.791 --> 01:43.250
Yay! Yay for Jay.

01:44.458 --> 01:47.083
Yep, winter can be
the fun-est time of the year,

01:47.208 --> 01:49.916
for a month or two, but then...

01:52.333 --> 01:57.250
It's so cold, my squish
has turned into a squish-sicle!

01:58.750 --> 02:01.958
So, um, this really isn't great.

02:03.750 --> 02:05.333
Oh, there.

02:06.458 --> 02:09.333
Oh, but that's... That's about it.

02:15.333 --> 02:19.041
Oh, that's happened so many times.

02:21.708 --> 02:25.916
Hmm. "Quiet. Trying to hibernate."

02:26.000 --> 02:28.416
Huh? Glow worms don't hibernate.

02:28.541 --> 02:30.750
This year we do.

02:31.916 --> 02:35.500
Anyway, winter is
just the fun-est, right?

02:35.625 --> 02:38.791
And when we left Jay,
he was about to...

02:38.916 --> 02:42.958
Well, let's just see
what he's about to do.

02:50.541 --> 02:54.083
Wow, sensational.

02:55.291 --> 02:57.875
Ouchie. I'm not trying that again.

02:58.000 --> 03:00.458
Winter is just too... freezicle.

03:00.583 --> 03:02.041
When's it over, Crick?

03:02.166 --> 03:06.416
Well, uh, Mr. Sun has been
on holiday for a long time,

03:06.541 --> 03:09.750
but I crickto-calculate

03:09.875 --> 03:13.916
that he is due to appear exactly...

03:14.041 --> 03:15.333
ten days ago.

03:15.458 --> 03:17.541
Mr. Sun is ten days late?

03:17.666 --> 03:20.000
He's forgotten all about us.

03:20.125 --> 03:21.500
Sorry the mail is late.

03:21.625 --> 03:24.583
Got so much ice on my wings,
I hadn't been cleared for take-off.

03:24.666 --> 03:26.458
Here, postcard from Mr. Sun.

03:28.958 --> 03:31.708
"Having a wonderful holiday.

03:31.833 --> 03:36.000
Perfect weather, as usual,
seems to follow me around.

03:36.083 --> 03:37.208
Oh!

03:37.500 --> 03:40.166
So, I'm going to stay a bit longer.

03:40.291 --> 03:42.541
Hope you don't mind. Smiley face."

03:42.666 --> 03:46.666
Uh, precisely how long is a bit?

03:46.791 --> 03:50.250
It better not be much or we'll freeze.

03:50.375 --> 03:53.708
I's already did.

03:54.458 --> 03:58.791
Hear that? That's what we'll be soon.
Frozen solid!

03:58.916 --> 04:03.000
We have think of a way to...
To stay warm.

04:03.125 --> 04:07.291
Let's do it... indoors.

04:10.791 --> 04:12.750
Uh-oh. Look.

04:16.958 --> 04:18.833
Why is that "uh-oh"?

04:18.958 --> 04:22.750
It's "uh-oh" because the
sunflower's come up too early,

04:22.875 --> 04:25.500
and that sunflower makes power
for our whole village.

04:25.625 --> 04:27.375
Absolutely correct, Kumi.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.583
When Mr. Sun comes out in the summer,

04:30.708 --> 04:33.375
the sunshine makes
the sunflower petals spin,

04:33.500 --> 04:36.541
which generates lots of elec-crick-ity.

04:36.666 --> 04:39.458
And the elec-crick-ity is stored

04:39.583 --> 04:43.791
in a special battery
for us to use all year round.

04:43.916 --> 04:46.541
Oh, I get it.

04:47.458 --> 04:48.833
What's "elec-crick-ity"?

04:48.958 --> 04:51.208
Elec-crick-ity
is what powers everything.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.791
If it wasn't for that
sunflower spinning around,

04:53.916 --> 04:55.750
we wouldn't have any power in winter

04:55.875 --> 04:58.375
for heaters or lights in our houses.

05:01.333 --> 05:04.583
-Yeah. You mean like now.
-And once the battery gives out...

05:06.208 --> 05:07.500
Like now.

05:07.625 --> 05:10.000
It'll get really, really brr.

05:10.125 --> 05:11.625
Like now.

05:11.750 --> 05:16.333
Yes. The sunflower must've
expected Mr. Sun last week.

05:16.458 --> 05:19.958
That's why it flowered too soon.

05:20.416 --> 05:24.458
And... And if anything
happens to that sunflower,

05:24.583 --> 05:29.208
we won't be able to make
anymore elec-crick-ity ever again.

05:29.333 --> 05:31.625
You're saying
we're definitely going to freeze.

05:31.750 --> 05:34.291
So-- So, how much time
do you think we have left?

05:34.416 --> 05:37.458
Crick? Kumi? How much time?!

05:37.583 --> 05:41.625
I'd tell you, Walter,
but my watch is frozen.

05:58.125 --> 06:01.541
Okay. Here's my plan:

06:01.666 --> 06:06.125
If we align the crickto-magnifier
just so...

06:06.208 --> 06:07.291
Whee!

06:07.625 --> 06:11.291
...it will focus all the heat
left in the sky,

06:11.416 --> 06:15.916
so, the sunflower
will feel warm as toast.

06:18.458 --> 06:22.625
As it appears, the sky
doesn't have any heat left.

06:23.083 --> 06:24.750
My apologies.

06:25.125 --> 06:26.875
It was a good plan, Crick.

06:27.833 --> 06:29.750
I don't want to alarm anyone,

06:29.875 --> 06:34.500
but my squish-sicle
is becoming a squish-berg!

06:36.208 --> 06:40.041
I will. I... I will think of something.

06:40.166 --> 06:41.875
I have to.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.625
Oh, think. Think!

06:48.666 --> 06:53.250
Uh... My, uh... brain is frozen.

06:54.458 --> 06:56.708
Guys! Guys! He's here!

06:56.833 --> 06:59.416
Mr. Sun is back!

07:05.000 --> 07:07.333
It's Mr. Sun! He's in there!

07:12.708 --> 07:17.541
Oh, it's not Mr. Sun. Sorry.

07:17.666 --> 07:19.791
Aw, it's okay, Buzz.

07:19.916 --> 07:22.958
Hey, if that little light...

07:23.083 --> 07:26.708
If it could fool us,
maybe it can fool the sunflower.

07:26.791 --> 07:30.291
-What do you say, Crick?
-It's worth a try.

07:37.041 --> 07:39.500
Here's my new plan:

07:39.625 --> 07:41.791
We lift the light up into the sky,

07:41.916 --> 07:46.666
and shine it through
my crickto-magnifier, then...

07:48.458 --> 07:50.958
No way. That may have
been our last chance.

07:51.083 --> 07:55.083
-The last-est?
-Our last-est chance?

07:55.208 --> 07:58.333
Stay calm, everyone. Stay calm!

07:58.458 --> 08:00.708
You know, I almost panicked
for a minute there,

08:00.833 --> 08:04.583
but now, I'm... totally in control!

08:04.708 --> 08:08.416
Bugs, we have to get a message
to Mr. Sun asking him to come back.

08:08.541 --> 08:12.083
Otherwise our sunflower
is gonna die, and then--

08:12.208 --> 08:14.125
Of course!

08:14.250 --> 08:17.458
We, uh... We could send a message
to Mr. Sun

08:17.583 --> 08:20.000
on my old faithful crickta-gram.

08:20.125 --> 08:23.083
- Yeah! Go, Crick!
- Crick is a star!

08:23.208 --> 08:27.125
Except the crickta-gram needs
elec-crick-ity, too.

08:29.416 --> 08:32.791
Crick, how much power
would you need to send a message?

08:32.916 --> 08:35.166
Quite a lot, I'm afraid.

08:35.291 --> 08:39.500
But it doesn't need to last for long.

08:43.041 --> 08:46.291
I... I think I might know how to do it.

08:47.791 --> 08:49.666
Wake up, Glowies! Wake up!

08:49.791 --> 08:51.333
Go away!

08:52.375 --> 08:56.458
Hey, little guys. Wouldn't you love
to see Mr. Sun come back?

08:56.583 --> 09:00.041
So, you could be
all cozy and warm again?

09:03.625 --> 09:06.458
And you just have to do
one teeny-weensy tiny thing...

09:06.583 --> 09:09.083
And it's the fun-est thing ever-er.

09:14.125 --> 09:16.833
Yes. Uh, ready to go.

09:16.958 --> 09:18.458
Jay? Buzz?

09:18.583 --> 09:19.958
Are the Glowies ready?

09:20.791 --> 09:23.000
They are ready, Kumi!

09:23.125 --> 09:25.750
Three, two, one, go!

09:40.000 --> 09:41.625
-Whoo-hoo!
-Yes!

09:50.541 --> 09:53.333
Has to work, has to work, has to...

09:59.208 --> 10:01.791
-Crick, is it...?
-It is. It is!

10:01.916 --> 10:03.458
Dear Mr. Sun,

10:03.583 --> 10:06.166
we need you back. Now.

10:06.291 --> 10:07.416
So, hurry up!

10:12.583 --> 10:14.583
Uh-oh.

10:27.666 --> 10:30.250
Did it work? Did it? Did it? Did it?

10:30.375 --> 10:33.375
I, uh... I can't be sure.

10:53.333 --> 10:56.500

It's summer,
my favorite time of the year.

12:31.666 --> 12:34.083
It's my chance to shine, you know?

12:55.916 --> 13:00.666
Oh, yeah! These crickto-squirts
are your fun-est invention yet, Crick.

13:00.791 --> 13:02.208
Hey, Mr. Sun.

13:02.333 --> 13:06.208
This is the most-est awesome
summer you've ever made.

13:06.333 --> 13:07.791
Why, thank you, Buzz.

13:07.916 --> 13:10.791
I want to be just like you
when I grow up.

13:10.916 --> 13:13.208
You're the king of the garden.

13:13.291 --> 13:17.208
King, huh? Well, I guess
everyone does look up to me.

13:17.333 --> 13:19.541
They don't have a choice.

13:21.125 --> 13:22.041
What...?

13:27.958 --> 13:29.250
What's that?!

13:30.416 --> 13:33.416
-Run!
-Run!

14:02.666 --> 14:05.000
-Oh, my belly-ness.
-What is it?

14:08.875 --> 14:13.791
It's, uh... safe to come out.

14:17.208 --> 14:18.833
I know what this is, I know.

14:18.958 --> 14:20.583
What? What is it?

14:20.708 --> 14:22.833
It's a tent, for a camping trip.

14:22.958 --> 14:25.708
-Awesome.
-We can have the most amazing time.

14:25.833 --> 14:28.500
But, guys, it's totally a waterslide!

14:28.625 --> 14:30.083
Watch.

14:31.583 --> 14:32.916
Whoa!

14:35.208 --> 14:36.916
-Yeah!
-Awesom-er!

14:37.041 --> 14:38.291
Uh, sorry, Jay,

14:38.416 --> 14:44.083
but this is the perfect material
for a new cooling device I invented:

14:44.208 --> 14:45.416
The Crick-O-Fan.

14:45.541 --> 14:49.125
-Even... Even awesom-er-er-er!
-Oh, can't you see?

14:49.250 --> 14:52.833
This would make fabulous costumes
for my latest play.

14:52.958 --> 14:55.375
The material is to die for.

14:55.500 --> 14:58.208
Awesom-er-er-er-est?

14:58.333 --> 15:00.375
Buzz, what do you think it should be?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.333
Me? Um...

15:02.458 --> 15:07.250
Well, me thinks you all have
the most-est awesome ideas.

15:07.375 --> 15:09.666
But it's totally a waterslide.

15:10.250 --> 15:12.083
Camping is the fun-est thing ever.

15:12.208 --> 15:14.666
But the Crick-O-Fan
will cool us all down.

15:14.750 --> 15:16.958
-Um...
-Uh, hello?

15:17.083 --> 15:18.708
Why are we even talking...?

15:18.833 --> 15:23.083
I... I don't really have any ideas.

15:34.208 --> 15:36.708
I wish I could have an idea.

15:36.833 --> 15:40.666
All my friends have ideas
'cause they're good at stuff.

15:40.791 --> 15:42.666
So, what am I good at?

15:42.791 --> 15:46.958
Do I have a... special talent?

15:47.083 --> 15:51.250
Oh, I know!
I'll go on a journey to find out!

15:52.833 --> 15:54.541
Whoa!

15:55.375 --> 15:57.166
Ouchie.

16:05.708 --> 16:06.958
Mr. Mudwasp!

16:07.083 --> 16:09.041
Buzz. Come on in.

16:09.166 --> 16:11.750
I'm in a big hurry
to finish these house renovations,

16:11.875 --> 16:15.708
'cause me and the missus got
another clutch of little ones on the way.

16:16.791 --> 16:17.833
Ooh!

16:21.458 --> 16:23.375
What's that mean, Mr. Wasp?

16:23.500 --> 16:26.500
Thinks he can speak Spanish, he does. Ha.

16:27.625 --> 16:29.750
Well, I'll have you know, Buzz,
it means...

16:29.875 --> 16:31.125
It...

16:32.208 --> 16:33.583
It means, "Ouch."

16:33.708 --> 16:36.000
Wow, you sure are clever.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.541
Oh, well. Thank you.

16:38.666 --> 16:39.875
Here's a bit.

16:47.583 --> 16:50.166
I'm actually on a journey, Mr. Mudwasp,

16:50.291 --> 16:52.416
to find my special talent.

16:52.541 --> 16:54.583
Maybe I can give building a try.

16:54.708 --> 16:57.791
Well, I'll take all the help I can get.

16:58.625 --> 17:00.333
Yeah!

17:08.333 --> 17:10.290
-Ow.
-Uh-oh.

17:16.458 --> 17:18.083
Sorry, Mr. Mudwasp.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.790
Building is a most-est special talent,

17:20.958 --> 17:23.750
and you're the best-est builder
in the world.

17:27.208 --> 17:29.083
Wait a blooming minute.

17:29.625 --> 17:31.583
Now I got a view.

17:31.708 --> 17:33.166
Open plan.

17:33.291 --> 17:36.458
I don't know why I didn't think
of that myself, Buzz.

17:36.958 --> 17:37.958
Ah.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.666
She's a great kid.

17:46.125 --> 17:48.750
There. We just need a few more tent poles.

17:48.875 --> 17:51.583
Ladybirds and Beetlemen,

17:51.666 --> 17:54.583
get ready for a spine tingling,

17:54.708 --> 17:56.958
squish-quivering show!

17:57.083 --> 17:59.833
-If this works--
-Waterslide!

17:59.916 --> 18:01.041
Whoa!

18:04.791 --> 18:07.458
Okay, we need to settle this.

18:07.583 --> 18:11.666
Let's get Buzz to decide.
Buzz?

18:11.791 --> 18:16.000
-Where is she?
-She seem to be, uh... absent?

18:16.125 --> 18:18.333
But it's not intermission yet.

18:18.416 --> 18:21.333
Uh... Maybe we didn't
pay enough attention to her.

18:21.458 --> 18:24.541
Well, we did talk over her.

18:26.666 --> 18:28.375
She's run away?

18:29.791 --> 18:31.791
What if she's been stepped on?

18:31.916 --> 18:33.916
It's a jungle out there.

18:34.041 --> 18:37.583
We need our Buzz back. Come on.

18:42.083 --> 18:43.583
Maybe...

18:43.708 --> 18:45.958
-No.
-Awesome!

18:47.833 --> 18:50.500
-Oh, Buzz.
-What are you making, Miss Doris?

18:50.583 --> 18:55.541
Well, it's a web sculpture
for my next art exhibition,

18:55.750 --> 18:58.833
but I'm afraid I have an artistic block.

18:58.958 --> 19:01.375
My web simply won't come out.

19:01.500 --> 19:04.166
But your sculptures
are the best-est, Miss Doris.

19:04.291 --> 19:05.916
Why, thank you, Buzz.

19:06.041 --> 19:08.916
I'm actually on a journey
to find my special talent.

19:09.041 --> 19:12.375
-Do you think I can give art a try?
-Of course, Buzz.

19:12.500 --> 19:16.541
Just imagine you are the web.

19:23.375 --> 19:25.458
Nice work, Buzz.

19:25.583 --> 19:28.166
You... became the web.

19:28.250 --> 19:29.791
Uh-oh.

19:38.125 --> 19:39.500
Sorry, Miss Doris.

19:39.625 --> 19:41.875
Art is a most-est special talent,

19:42.000 --> 19:44.958
and you're the
best-est artist in the world.

19:45.041 --> 19:47.416
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

19:55.416 --> 19:59.708
That's it! Buzz, you helped me unblock.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.166
Buzz?

20:03.708 --> 20:07.833
Hmm. Lovely little bug,
and so full of talent.

20:17.375 --> 20:19.750
Wha-- Whoa! Ouchie.

20:20.541 --> 20:22.958
Can't even fly!

20:23.083 --> 20:27.625
I've tried everything,
and I'm not good at anything.

20:27.750 --> 20:31.125
So, my special talent must be nothing.

20:34.958 --> 20:38.083
Oh, why so overcast, Buzz?

20:38.208 --> 20:42.000
Everyone has a special talent,
excepting me.

20:42.125 --> 20:45.125
Mr. Mudwasp is an awesome builder,

20:45.250 --> 20:47.916
and Miss Doris is an awesome artist,

20:48.041 --> 20:53.625
and... and... and you go around
brightening everyone's day.

20:53.750 --> 20:58.416
I wish I could be like you
when I grow up, Mr. Sun.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.583
Oh.

21:00.208 --> 21:03.416
Maybe you already are, kid.

21:03.541 --> 21:04.625
Buzz!

21:05.916 --> 21:09.291
Oh, thank goodness gracious.

21:09.416 --> 21:10.416
Oh, we missed you.

21:10.541 --> 21:13.208
You made us feel special,
but you're the special one.

21:13.333 --> 21:14.958
The special-est!

21:15.083 --> 21:18.125
Come home.
We've got a surprise for you.

21:20.541 --> 21:22.625
Buzz, we wanted you to know...

21:22.750 --> 21:24.291
That you brighten everyone's day.

21:24.416 --> 21:26.833
Which we think makes you just like...

21:26.958 --> 21:28.625
