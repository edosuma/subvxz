WEBVTT

00:08.600 --> 00:10.199
They just walked out of there!

00:10.200 --> 00:12.239
Yeah, I know,
I was sort of sitting next to you.

00:12.240 --> 00:14.559
The whole Waters family.
They just walked right out of there!

00:14.560 --> 00:18.239
Again, I was in the room.
How do they always manage that?!

00:18.240 --> 00:19.679
They're good.

00:19.680 --> 00:21.479
They're greedy
and they'll do it again,

00:21.480 --> 00:23.759
and next time we're going to
catch them in the act.

00:23.760 --> 00:24.760
How?

00:26.000 --> 00:32.073
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:34.360 --> 00:35.320
No good?

00:35.321 --> 00:38.399
They always know we're coming.
How do they always know?!

00:38.400 --> 00:40.719
They're good, they work at it.

00:40.720 --> 00:43.280
They're never going to stop.
Well, neither are we.

00:53.600 --> 00:54.720
Argh!

01:03.600 --> 01:05.438
Argh!

01:05.440 --> 01:08.320
Argh! AARGH!

01:09.560 --> 01:13.159
Oh! Greg... In the act!

01:13.160 --> 01:17.320
It's the only way we're going to
do this, in the act!

01:46.280 --> 01:48.159
They're still blocking it?

01:48.160 --> 01:50.439
Yeah. Very efficiently hacked.

01:50.440 --> 01:52.999
They must be bloody pleased
with theMs.elves.

01:53.000 --> 01:55.200
They must be.

02:00.960 --> 02:02.399
Right then?

02:02.400 --> 02:05.879
Ah, no! No, you've got to make
the arrest. This one's yours, boss.

02:05.880 --> 02:08.038
You've never called me boss before.

02:08.039 --> 02:10.439
Oh, well, look what happens
when you're good.

02:10.440 --> 02:13.679
You know how most days
aren't good days?

02:13.680 --> 02:15.921
This is a good day. Not
for the Waters family.

02:16.920 --> 02:18.959
OK, ten men on the roof,
all exits covered.

02:18.960 --> 02:21.560
The bank's closed, so we've
no hostages to worry about.

02:22.320 --> 02:23.839
Sorry, no, go on. Go on.

02:23.840 --> 02:26.001
Um, we've got the tunnel
entrance covered...

02:26.080 --> 02:27.679
and Davies, Willow and Christie

02:27.680 --> 02:29.961
are heading up armed
response on Mafeking Road.

02:30.360 --> 02:32.760
Sorry, I'd better get this.
It's him, isn't it?

02:39.960 --> 02:41.679
I, I, I have to go. What?!

02:41.680 --> 02:42.999
You make the arrest. No way!

02:43.000 --> 02:45.119
Sorry, you'll be fine.
I'm cool with this.

02:45.120 --> 02:48.400
Jones will get all the credit
if you leave now, you know he will.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.520
Yeah, well, yeah, it doesn't matter,
I have to go.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.519
Back up! I need maximum back up!

02:58.520 --> 03:00.480
Baker Street now!

03:13.000 --> 03:14.199
What's going on?!

03:14.200 --> 03:16.119
This is hard. What?

03:16.120 --> 03:18.480
Really hard.
Hardest thing I've ever had to do.

03:21.040 --> 03:23.960
Do you know any funny stories
about John?

03:25.560 --> 03:27.639
What?!

03:27.640 --> 03:30.680
I need anecdotes.
Didn't go to any trouble, did you?

04:58.360 --> 05:01.719
Shut up, Mrs. Hudson.
I haven't said a word.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.759
You're formulating a question,

05:03.760 --> 05:06.239
it's physically painful
watching you think.

05:06.240 --> 05:08.159
I thought it was you playing.

05:08.160 --> 05:09.320
It was me playing.

05:10.320 --> 05:11.799
I am composing.

05:11.800 --> 05:14.199
You were dancing.

05:14.200 --> 05:15.679
I was road-testing.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.879
You what?

05:16.880 --> 05:18.719
Why are you here?

05:18.720 --> 05:22.559
I'm bringing you your morning tea.
You're not usually awake.

05:22.560 --> 05:23.999
You bring me tea in the morning?

05:24.000 --> 05:25.759
Well, where do you think
it came from?

05:25.760 --> 05:28.159
I don't know.
I just thought it sort of happened.

05:28.160 --> 05:29.799
Your mother has a lot to answer for.

05:29.800 --> 05:32.359
Hmm, I know. I have a list.

05:32.360 --> 05:34.559
Mycroft has a file.

05:34.560 --> 05:37.599
So, it's the big day then.

05:37.600 --> 05:39.759
What big day?

05:39.760 --> 05:43.319
The wedding! John and Mary
getting married.

05:43.320 --> 05:46.159
Two people who currently live
together are about to attend church,

05:46.160 --> 05:49.039
have a party, go on a short holiday,
then carry on living together.

05:49.040 --> 05:51.319
What's big about that?
It changes people, marriage.

05:51.320 --> 05:52.919
Hmm, no it doesn't.

05:52.920 --> 05:57.199
Well, you wouldn't understand,
cos you always live alone.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.439
Your husband was executed
for double murder.

05:59.440 --> 06:01.639
You're hardly an advert
for companionship.

06:01.640 --> 06:05.359
Marriage changes you as a person
in ways that you can't imagine.

06:05.360 --> 06:06.879
As does lethal injection.

06:06.880 --> 06:10.319
My best friend, Margaret,
she was my chief bridesmaid,

06:10.320 --> 06:13.679
we were going to be best friends
forever, we always said that,

06:13.680 --> 06:15.399
but I hardly saw her after that.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.119
Aren't there usually biscuits?
I've run out. Have the shops?

06:18.120 --> 06:21.719
She cried the whole day, saying,
"Ooh, it's the end of an era."

06:21.720 --> 06:23.479
I'm sure the shop
on the corner is open.

06:23.480 --> 06:27.199
She was probably right, really.
I remember she left early.

06:27.200 --> 06:31.399
I mean, who leaves a wedding early?
So sad.

06:31.400 --> 06:33.759
Hmm. Anyway, you've got
things to do.

06:33.760 --> 06:36.839
No, not really. I've got plenty of
time to get ready... Biscuits!

06:36.840 --> 06:39.839
Oh! I really am going to
have a word with your mother.

06:39.840 --> 06:42.520
You can if you like,
she understands very little.

06:58.400 --> 07:00.280
Right then.

07:05.880 --> 07:08.000
Into battle.

08:14.120 --> 08:15.839
Congratulations!

08:15.840 --> 08:19.719
OK, hold it there, I want to get
this shot of the newlyweds.

08:19.720 --> 08:22.160
Er, just the bride and groom,
please.

08:23.320 --> 08:25.999
Sherlock...
Oh, sorry.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.520
OK, three, two, one, cheese.

08:38.360 --> 08:42.639
The famous Mr.. Holmes.
I'm very pleased to meet you.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.959
But no sex, OK? Sorry?!

08:44.960 --> 08:48.239
You don't have to look so scared,
I'm only messing.

08:48.240 --> 08:51.879
Bridesmaid, best man,
it's a bit traditional.

08:51.880 --> 08:54.319
Is it? But not obligatory.

08:54.320 --> 08:56.228
If that's the sort of
thing you're looking for,

08:56.240 --> 08:58.039
the man over there in
blue is your best bet.

08:58.040 --> 09:00.319
Recently divorced doctor
with a ginger cat...

09:00.320 --> 09:03.599
A barn conversion and a history
of erectile dysfunction.

09:03.600 --> 09:06.079
Reviewing that information,
possibly not your best bet.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.479
Yeah, maybe not.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.199
Sorry, there was one more deduction
there than I was expecting.

09:10.200 --> 09:13.640
Mr.. Holmes, you're going
to be incredibly useful.

09:21.640 --> 09:23.839
Hello. Lovely to meet you.

09:23.840 --> 09:25.639
How are you?
Beautiful, Mary.

09:25.640 --> 09:27.639
Thank you.
Congratulations.

09:27.640 --> 09:28.679
David!

09:28.680 --> 09:33.439
Ah, ah, Mary. Congratulations,
you look, um, very nice.

09:33.440 --> 09:36.719
Thanks. John, congratulations.
You're a lucky man. Thank you.

09:36.720 --> 09:40.319
Um, David, this is Sherlock. Hmm.

09:40.320 --> 09:43.280
Um, yeah, we've um... We've met.

09:46.840 --> 09:50.720
So, what exactly are my duties
as an usher?

09:52.080 --> 09:54.399
Let's talk about Mary first.

09:54.400 --> 09:55.839
Sorry, what?

09:55.840 --> 09:59.519
Well, I think you know what.
You went out with her for two years.

09:59.520 --> 10:01.879
Er, ages ago. We're...
We're just good friends now.

10:01.880 --> 10:03.119
Is that a fact?

10:03.120 --> 10:05.119
Whenever she tweets, you
respond within five

10:05.131 --> 10:07.319
minutes, regardless of
time or current location,

10:07.320 --> 10:09.272
suggesting you have her on text alert.
In your

10:09.284 --> 10:11.039
Facebook photographs
of the happy couple,

10:11.040 --> 10:14.479
Mary takes centre frame, whereas John
is always partly or entirely excluded.

10:14.480 --> 10:18.319
Well, you can't assume from that I've still
got some kind of interest in Mary...

10:18.320 --> 10:21.839
You volunteered to be a shoulder to cry on
on no less than three separate occasions.

10:21.840 --> 10:24.519
Do you have anything to say
in your defence?

10:24.520 --> 10:27.479
I think from now on, we'll downgrade
you to casual acquaintance.

10:27.480 --> 10:29.919
No more than three planned
social encounters a year

10:29.920 --> 10:31.759
and always in John's presence.

10:31.760 --> 10:34.320
I have your contact details.
I will be monitoring.

10:35.920 --> 10:39.999
They're right about you.
You're a bloody psychopath.

10:40.000 --> 10:43.200
High functioning sociopath,
with your number.

10:53.680 --> 10:54.880
Um...

10:57.560 --> 10:59.759
Hello. Darling. Thank you.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.959
You look fabulous. Thank you.

11:01.960 --> 11:03.880
Thanks for coming, thank you.

11:05.880 --> 11:08.319
Er, yes, well done in the service,
Archie.

11:08.320 --> 11:12.280
He's really come out of his shell.
I don't know how you did it. Um...

11:17.040 --> 11:19.279
Basically it's a cute smile
to the bride's side,

11:19.280 --> 11:21.639
cute smile to the groom's side
and then the rings. No.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.279
And you have to wear the outfit. No.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.279
You really do have to wear
the outfit. What for?

11:25.280 --> 11:28.199
Grown-ups like that sort of thing.
Why?

11:28.200 --> 11:30.319
I don't know, I'll ask one.

11:30.320 --> 11:32.719
You're a detective.

11:32.720 --> 11:35.319
Yep. Have you solved any murders?

11:35.320 --> 11:37.560
Sure, loads. Can I see?

11:39.040 --> 11:40.240
Yeah, all right.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.279
What's all the stuff in his eye?

11:49.280 --> 11:51.999
Maggots. Cool!

11:52.000 --> 11:53.279
Hmm.

11:53.280 --> 11:56.039
He said you had some
pictures for him, as a treat?

11:56.040 --> 11:58.239
Er, yes, if he's good.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.799
Beheadings. Lovely little village.

12:00.800 --> 12:03.160
Hmm? What did you say?

12:07.920 --> 12:09.400
Hold it.

12:11.280 --> 12:12.440
Nice.

12:16.920 --> 12:19.039
I'm starving. Thanks.

12:19.040 --> 12:21.240
I had to lose so much weight to
get into this dress.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.199
Hmm, he's nice.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.759
Traces of two leading brands of deodorant,
both advertised for their strength,

12:28.760 --> 12:31.959
suggestive of a chronic body odour
problem, manifesting under stress.

12:31.960 --> 12:34.680
OK, done there.
What about his friend?

12:37.360 --> 12:40.919
Long-term relationship,
compulsive cheat. Seriously?

12:40.920 --> 12:43.159
Waterproof cover on his smart-phone.

12:43.160 --> 12:46.199
Yet his complexion
doesn't indicate outdoor work.

12:46.200 --> 12:49.359
It suggests he's in the habit of taking
his phone into the shower with him,

12:49.360 --> 12:51.356
which means he often
receives texts and emails

12:51.368 --> 12:53.119
he'd rather went unseen.
Can I keep you?

12:53.120 --> 12:55.920
Do you like solving crimes?
Do you have a vacancy?

12:57.360 --> 12:59.239
So, Harry? Er, no. No show.

12:59.240 --> 13:00.719
Darling, I'm so sorry.

13:00.720 --> 13:03.679
Yeah, it was a bit of a punt
asking her, I suppose.

13:03.680 --> 13:06.320
Still, free bar,
wouldn't have been a good mix.

13:08.280 --> 13:10.319
Oh. God, wow!

13:10.320 --> 13:13.400
Is that...? He came.

13:17.320 --> 13:21.000
So that's him, Major Sholto.
Uh-huh.

13:23.520 --> 13:27.399
If they're such good friends,
why does he barely even mention him?

13:27.400 --> 13:30.839
He mentions him all the time to me,
never shuts up about him.

13:30.840 --> 13:32.959
About HIM? Mm-hmm.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.399
Urgh! I chose this wine,
it's bloody awful!

13:35.400 --> 13:38.279
Yes, but it's definitely him
that he talks about? Mm-hmm.

13:38.280 --> 13:41.400
I'm very, very, glad to see you, sir.

13:42.600 --> 13:45.679
I know you don't really
do this sort of thing.

13:45.680 --> 13:47.999
Well, I do for old friends,
Watson.

13:48.000 --> 13:49.759
John.

13:49.760 --> 13:51.840
It's good to see you. You too.

13:54.640 --> 13:56.559
Civilian life suiting you, then?

13:56.560 --> 14:00.399
Er, er, yes. Well, I think so, sir.
No more need for the trick cyclist?

14:00.400 --> 14:03.080
No, I go now and then.
Sort of a top-up.

14:04.520 --> 14:06.840
Therapy can be very helpful.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.439
Where are you living these days?

14:12.440 --> 14:15.639
Oh, way out in the middle of
nowhere. You wouldn't know it.

14:15.640 --> 14:18.079
You look well... I've never even
heard him say his name.

14:18.080 --> 14:21.479
Well, he's almost a recluse,
you know, since... Yes.

14:21.480 --> 14:23.319
I didn't think he'd show up at all.

14:23.320 --> 14:25.559
John says he's the most unsociable
man he's ever met.

14:25.560 --> 14:27.599
He is? He's the most unsociable?
Hmm.

14:27.600 --> 14:31.119
Ah, that's why he's bouncing around
him like a puppy.

14:31.120 --> 14:33.239
Oh, Sherlock!

14:33.240 --> 14:36.639
Neither of us were the first,
you know. Stop smiling.

14:36.640 --> 14:38.640
It's my wedding day!

14:41.520 --> 14:43.640
Urgh!

15:12.000 --> 15:14.679
Yes? What, Sherlock?

15:14.680 --> 15:16.799
Why are you out of breath? Filing.

15:16.800 --> 15:20.639
Either I've caught you in a compromising
position or you've been working out again.

15:20.640 --> 15:22.639
I favour the latter.
What do you want?

15:22.640 --> 15:25.239
I need your answer, Mycroft,
as a matter of urgency.

15:25.240 --> 15:29.199
Answer? Even at the eleventh hour,
it's not too late, you know.

15:29.200 --> 15:30.359
Oh, Lord!

15:30.360 --> 15:33.559
Cars can be ordered,
private jets commandeered.

15:33.560 --> 15:36.519
Today. It's today, isn't it?

15:36.520 --> 15:39.759
No, Sherlock, I will not be
coming to the night-do,

15:39.760 --> 15:41.439
as you so poetically put it.

15:41.440 --> 15:45.359
What a shame.
Mary and John will be extremely d...

15:45.360 --> 15:48.319
Delighted not to have me
hanging around.

15:48.320 --> 15:49.759
Oh, I don't know.

15:49.760 --> 15:52.879
There should always be
a spectre at the feast.

15:52.880 --> 15:56.279
So, this is it, then? The big day.

15:56.280 --> 15:59.279
I suppose I'll be seeing
a lot more of you from now on.

15:59.280 --> 16:01.839
What do you mean?
Just like old times.

16:01.840 --> 16:05.359
No, I don't understand. 'Well,
it's the end of an era, isn't it?'

16:05.360 --> 16:08.399
John and Mary, domestic bliss.

16:08.400 --> 16:11.600
No, no, no. I prefer to think of it
as the beginning of a new chapter.

16:13.600 --> 16:17.119
What? Nothing.
I know that silence. What?

16:17.120 --> 16:18.839
Well, I'd better let you
get back to it.

16:18.840 --> 16:21.439
You have a big speech or something,
don't you?

16:21.440 --> 16:24.959
What? Cakes, karaoke, mingling.

16:24.960 --> 16:28.319
Mycroft! This is what people do,
Sherlock. They get married.

16:28.320 --> 16:31.039
I warned you, don't get involved.

16:31.040 --> 16:32.999
Involved? I'm not involved. No...

16:33.000 --> 16:36.439
John asked me to be his best man, how could
I say no? Absolutely. I'm not involved.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.599
I believe you. Really, I do.

16:38.600 --> 16:42.440
Have a lovely day and do give
the happy couple my best.

16:43.680 --> 16:44.919
I will.

16:44.920 --> 16:49.080
Oh, by the way, Sherlock,
do you remember Redbeard?

16:51.400 --> 16:53.599
I'm not a child anymore, Mycroft.

16:53.600 --> 16:55.639
No, of course you're not.

16:55.640 --> 16:58.120
Enjoy not getting involved, Sherlock.

17:20.240 --> 17:22.079
Pray silence for the best man.

17:29.840 --> 17:34.599
Ladies and gentlemen,
family and friends,

17:34.600 --> 17:39.880
and... um, others.

17:43.880 --> 17:46.160
Er...

17:51.160 --> 17:52.920
A-also...

17:57.440 --> 17:59.999
Greg... Molly.
I've just had a thought.

18:00.000 --> 18:01.079
Is that a brain?

18:01.080 --> 18:03.199
What if John asks Sherlock
to be his best man?

18:03.200 --> 18:05.559
Well, he will, won't he?
He's bound to. Exactly.

18:05.560 --> 18:09.839
So? So, he'll have to make a speech,
in front of people.

18:09.840 --> 18:13.480
There'll be actual people there,
actually listening.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.799
Well, what's the worst
that could happen?

18:16.800 --> 18:19.039
Helen-Louise probably
wondered the same.

18:19.040 --> 18:20.600
Helen-Louise?

18:26.680 --> 18:28.039
Oh, hello dear.

18:28.040 --> 18:30.479
I was just thinking,
if John does ask Sherlock...

18:30.480 --> 18:33.559
What, the speech, dear?
No, it'll be fine.

18:33.560 --> 18:36.520
It's not just the speech,
though, is it?

18:44.800 --> 18:46.239
Oh, brilliant!

18:46.240 --> 18:49.399
Mr..s Hudson? Hello, darling.
Are you all right?

18:49.400 --> 18:51.959
I was coming to see Sherlock
and I thought you were...

18:51.960 --> 18:54.439
No... Possibly dying.

18:54.440 --> 18:56.479
Oh, sorry.

18:56.480 --> 18:58.919
What's wrong?

18:58.920 --> 19:01.519
The telegraMs...!

19:01.520 --> 19:03.039
Sorry, what?

19:03.040 --> 19:05.760
Oh, sorry.

19:08.520 --> 19:10.759
TelegraMs...!

19:10.760 --> 19:17.839
Right, um... First
things first, telegraMs...

19:17.840 --> 19:21.319
Well, they're not actually telegraMs.., we
just call them telegraMs... I don't know why.

19:21.320 --> 19:23.039
Wedding tradition.

19:23.040 --> 19:26.439
Because we don't have enough of that
already, apparently.

19:26.440 --> 19:27.519
"To Mr.. and Mr..s Watson,

19:27.520 --> 19:30.239
"so sorry I am unable to be with
you on your special day.

19:30.240 --> 19:33.439
"Good luck and best wishes,
Mike Stanford." Aah. Aw.

19:33.440 --> 19:36.159
"To John and Mary, all good
wishes for your special day,"

19:36.160 --> 19:38.359
"with love and many big..."

19:38.360 --> 19:41.520
"Big squishy cuddles
from Stella and Ted."

19:43.640 --> 19:46.719
"Mary, lots of love..."

19:46.720 --> 19:48.559
Yeah?

19:48.560 --> 19:53.519
"Poppet. Oodles of love
and heaps of good wishes from Cam."

19:53.520 --> 19:56.839
"Wish your family
could have seen this."

19:56.840 --> 20:01.519
"Special day..."
"Very special day..."

20:01.520 --> 20:04.039
"Love..." "Love..." "Love..."
"Love..." "Love..."

20:04.040 --> 20:07.160
Bit of a theme, you get the general
gist. People are basically fond.

20:09.520 --> 20:11.640
John Watson.

20:14.280 --> 20:16.320
My friend, John Watson.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.839
John...

20:19.840 --> 20:23.359
When John first broached the subject
of being best man, I was confused.

20:23.360 --> 20:25.959
Sherlock? What was that
noise downstairs?

20:25.960 --> 20:27.359
Oh, it was Mr..s Hudson laughing.

20:27.360 --> 20:29.599
Hmm, it sounded like
she was torturing an owl.

20:29.600 --> 20:31.759
Yeah, well, it was laughter.

20:31.760 --> 20:32.960
Could have been both.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.319
Busy?

20:35.320 --> 20:39.439
Oh, just occupying myself.
Sometimes it's so hard not smoking.

20:39.440 --> 20:41.679
Mind if I interrupt?

20:41.680 --> 20:42.800
Be my guest.

20:44.880 --> 20:50.919
Tea? Er... So, er,
the big question.

20:50.920 --> 20:52.200
Mm-hmm?

20:53.720 --> 20:55.679
The best man.

20:55.680 --> 20:57.039
The best man?

20:57.040 --> 20:59.319
What do you think?
Billy Kincaid.

20:59.320 --> 21:02.399
Sorry, what? Billy Kincaid, the Camden
Garrotter, best man I ever knew.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.559
Vast contributions to charity,
never disclosed.

21:04.560 --> 21:07.399
Personally managed to save
three hospitals from closure

21:07.400 --> 21:10.519
and ran the best and safest
children's homes in north England.

21:10.520 --> 21:12.893
Yes, every now and again there'd
be some garrotings, but

21:12.905 --> 21:15.079
stacking up the lives saved
against the garrotings,

21:15.080 --> 21:17.319
on balance I'd say he...
For my wedding.

21:17.320 --> 21:18.919
For me, I need a best man.

21:18.920 --> 21:21.279
Oh, right. Maybe not a Garrotter.

21:21.280 --> 21:23.799
Gavin? Who?

21:23.800 --> 21:26.839
Gavin Lestrade?
He's a man and good at it.

21:26.840 --> 21:29.839
It's Greg.
And he's not my best friend.

21:29.840 --> 21:31.559
Oh, Mike Stanford, I see.

21:31.560 --> 21:34.759
Well, he's nice. Um, though I'm not
sure how well he'd cope with all...

21:34.760 --> 21:37.560
No, Mike's great,
but HE'S not my best friend.

21:39.640 --> 21:43.359
Look, Sherlock, this is the biggest
and most important day of my life...

21:43.360 --> 21:45.879
Well... No, it is. It is.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.199
And I want to be up there
with the two people

21:48.200 --> 21:52.400
that I love and care about
most in the world. Yes.

21:55.280 --> 21:57.520
So Mary Morstan... Yes.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.240
And...

22:05.200 --> 22:06.480
you.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.599
I confess at first I didn't realise
he was asking me.

22:11.600 --> 22:13.703
When finally I understood,
I expressed to him

22:13.715 --> 22:15.600
that I was both flattered
and surprised.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.329
I explained to him that
I'd never expected this

22:22.341 --> 22:24.479
request and I was a little
daunted in the face of it.

22:24.480 --> 22:25.760
Sherlock...

22:29.600 --> 22:31.345
I nonetheless promised
I would do my very

22:31.357 --> 22:33.239
best to accomplish a
task which was, for me,

22:33.240 --> 22:35.679
as demanding and difficult
as any I had ever contemplated.

22:35.680 --> 22:39.519
Additionally, I thanked him for the trust
he placed in me and indicated that I was,

22:39.520 --> 22:43.200
in some ways, very close to
being moved by it.

22:47.920 --> 22:49.879
No, it's getting a bit scary now.

22:49.880 --> 22:52.320
It later transpired that I'd said
none of this out loud.

22:59.320 --> 23:00.480
So, in fact...

23:03.720 --> 23:05.920
You, you mean... Yes.

23:07.240 --> 23:12.640
I'm your... best...
Man... friend?

23:14.280 --> 23:15.960
Yeah, of course you are.

23:17.320 --> 23:20.720
Of course... You're my best friend.

23:29.400 --> 23:32.359
How was that?

23:32.360 --> 23:34.080
Surprisingly OK.

23:36.200 --> 23:38.840
So you'll have to make a speech,
of course.

23:47.000 --> 23:49.159
Done that. Done that.

23:49.160 --> 23:50.999
Done that bit, done that bit.

23:51.000 --> 23:53.680
Done that bit. Hmm.

23:55.680 --> 23:58.159
I'm afraid, John,
I can't congratulate you.

23:58.160 --> 24:00.399
All emotions,
and in particular love,

24:00.400 --> 24:03.759
stand opposed to the pure, cold
reason I hold above all things.

24:03.760 --> 24:06.119
A wedding is,
in my considered opinion,

24:06.120 --> 24:10.759
nothing short of a celebration of all
that is false and specious and irrational

24:10.760 --> 24:13.799
and sentimental in this ailing
and morally compromised world.

24:13.800 --> 24:17.119
Today we honour the deathwatch beetle
that is the doom of our society,

24:17.120 --> 24:20.000
and in time, one feels certain,
our entire species.

24:27.320 --> 24:31.039
But anyway, let's talk about John.
Please.

24:31.040 --> 24:33.959
If I burden myself with a little
helpmate during my adventures,

24:33.960 --> 24:35.864
this is not out of
sentiment or caprice, it

24:35.876 --> 24:37.879
is that he has many fine
qualities of his own

24:37.880 --> 24:40.599
that he has overlooked
in his obsession with me.

24:40.600 --> 24:44.119
Indeed, any reputation I have for mental
acuity and sharpness comes, in truth,

24:44.120 --> 24:47.319
from the extraordinary contrast
John so selflessly provides.

24:47.320 --> 24:49.469
It is a fact, I believe,
that brides tend to favour

24:49.481 --> 24:51.599
exceptionally plain bridesmaids
for their big day.

24:51.600 --> 24:55.079
There is a certain analogy there,
I feel. And contrast is, after all,

24:55.080 --> 24:57.839
God's own plan to enhance
the beauty of his creation.

24:57.840 --> 25:00.279
Or it would be if God were not
a ludicrous fantasy

25:00.280 --> 25:03.280
designed to provide a career
opportunity for the family idiot.

25:06.600 --> 25:09.359
The point I'm trying to make
is that I am

25:09.360 --> 25:13.319
the most unpleasant, rude,

25:13.320 --> 25:16.159
ignorant and all-round
obnoxious arsehole

25:16.160 --> 25:19.519
that anyone could possibly have
the misfortune to meet.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.999
I am dismissive of the virtuous,

25:22.000 --> 25:24.079
unaware of the beautiful

25:24.080 --> 25:26.720
and uncomprehending
in the face of the happy.

25:27.840 --> 25:30.399
So if I didn't understand
I was being asked to be best man,

25:30.400 --> 25:33.640
it is because I never expected
to be anybody's best friend.

25:35.080 --> 25:37.319
And certainly not the best friend

25:37.320 --> 25:40.639
of the bravest and kindest
and wisest human being

25:40.640 --> 25:43.480
I have ever had the good fortune
of knowing.

25:45.000 --> 25:46.880
John, I am a ridiculous man.

25:47.920 --> 25:51.239
Redeemed only by the warmth
and constancy of your friendship.

25:51.240 --> 25:53.319
But, as I am apparently
your best friend,

25:53.320 --> 25:56.400
I cannot congratulate you
on your choice of companion.

25:58.960 --> 26:00.480
Actually, now I can.

26:02.240 --> 26:05.759
Mary, when I say
you deserve this man,

26:05.760 --> 26:09.399
it is the highest compliment
of which I am capable.

26:09.400 --> 26:16.079
John, you have endured war
and injury and tragic loss -

26:16.080 --> 26:20.959
so sorry again about that last one -
so know this, today you sit between

26:20.960 --> 26:25.199
the woman you have made your wife
and the man you have saved.

26:25.200 --> 26:29.319
In short, the two people who love
you most in all this world.

26:29.320 --> 26:31.759
And I know I speak for Mary as well
when I say,

26:31.760 --> 26:35.520
we will never let you down and we
have a lifetime ahead to prove that.

26:39.680 --> 26:42.280
(If I try and hug him, stop me.)
Certainly not.

26:43.720 --> 26:47.520
Ah, yes. Now onto
some funny stories about John.

26:50.040 --> 26:53.279
What's wrong? What happened?
Why are you all doing that? John?

26:53.280 --> 26:55.079
Oh, Sherlock!

26:55.080 --> 26:58.480
Did I do it wrong?
No, you didn't. Come here.

27:00.160 --> 27:02.679
I haven't finished yet.
Yeah, I know, I know.

27:02.680 --> 27:06.080
So onto some funny stories now...
Can you wait till I sit down?

27:14.720 --> 27:18.479
So, onto some funny stories
about John.

27:18.480 --> 27:22.679
If you could all just cheer up
a bit, that would be better.

27:22.680 --> 27:23.839
On we go.

27:23.840 --> 27:29.439
So for funny stories, one has to
look no further than John's blog.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.319
The record of our time together.

27:31.320 --> 27:33.679
Of course, he does
tend to romanticise things a bit,

27:33.680 --> 27:35.839
but then, you know, he's a romantic.

27:35.840 --> 27:39.159
We've tackled some strange cases.

27:39.160 --> 27:41.240
The Hollow Client...

27:47.400 --> 27:49.080
The Poison Giant...

27:53.280 --> 27:54.800
Get down, John!

28:00.520 --> 28:02.600
We've had some frustrating cases...

28:07.920 --> 28:10.119
What is that?

28:10.120 --> 28:12.679
A French decathlete found
completely out of his mind,

28:12.680 --> 28:15.719
surrounded by 1,812 matchboxes,

28:15.720 --> 28:17.239
all empty except this one.

28:17.240 --> 28:18.960
And what's in that one?

28:21.000 --> 28:23.080
Inexplicable.

28:26.160 --> 28:28.080
Touching cases...

28:29.480 --> 28:31.360
She's going to ring the doorbell.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.839
Oh, no. She's changed her mind.

28:35.840 --> 28:39.679
Oh, she's going to do it.
No, she's leaving.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.799
She's leaving.
Oh, she's coming back.

28:41.800 --> 28:46.039
She's a client, she's boring. I've
seen those symptoMs.. before. Hmm?

28:46.040 --> 28:49.639
Oscillation on the pavement
always means there's a love affair.

28:49.640 --> 28:52.840
And of course I have to mention
the elephant in the room...

28:56.760 --> 28:59.039
But we want something

28:59.040 --> 29:01.880
very particular for this
special day, don't we?

29:04.040 --> 29:05.560
The Bloody Guardsman...

29:08.680 --> 29:12.239
Need to work on your half of the
church, Mary, looking a bit thin.

29:12.240 --> 29:15.759
Oh, orphan's lot. Friends,
that's all I have, lots of friends.

29:15.760 --> 29:18.439
Schedule the organ music to
begin at precisely 11:48...

29:18.440 --> 29:20.919
But the rehearsal's not for
another two weeks, just calm down.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.759
Calm? I am calm. I'm extremely calm.

29:22.760 --> 29:25.039
Let's get back to the reception,
come on.

29:25.040 --> 29:26.839
John's cousin, top table?

29:26.840 --> 29:29.559
Hmm, hates you.
Can't even bear to think about you.

29:29.560 --> 29:32.559
Seriously? Second class post,
cheap card.

29:32.560 --> 29:35.719
Bought at a petrol station. Look at
the stamp, three attempts at licking,

29:35.720 --> 29:37.959
she's obviously unconsciously
retaining saliva.

29:37.960 --> 29:41.360
Ah, let's stick her by the bogs.
Oh, yes.

29:42.240 --> 29:43.960
Who else hates me?

29:46.600 --> 29:48.159
Oh, great, thanks.

29:48.160 --> 29:51.239
"Priceless painting nicked."
Looks interesting.

29:51.240 --> 29:52.599
Table four... Done.

29:52.600 --> 29:54.119
"My husband is three people."

29:54.120 --> 29:56.719
Table five...
Major James Sholto - who he?

29:56.720 --> 30:00.119
John's old commanding officer. I don't
think he's coming. He'll be there.

30:00.120 --> 30:02.399
Well, he needs to RSVP, then.
He'll be there. Oh.

30:02.400 --> 30:05.799
"My husband is three people."
It's interesting.

30:05.800 --> 30:08.879
It says he has three distinct
patterns of moles on his skin.

30:08.880 --> 30:12.519
Identical triplets, one in half a million
births. Solved it without leaving the flat.

30:12.520 --> 30:15.039
Now, serviettes...
Swan or Sydney Opera House?

30:15.040 --> 30:17.679
Where did you learn that? Many
skills are required in the field

30:17.680 --> 30:19.765
of criminal investigation...
Fibbing, Sherlock.

30:19.777 --> 30:21.479
I once broke an alibi
by demonstrating

30:21.480 --> 30:23.470
the exact severity of a fold...
I'm not John, I can

30:23.482 --> 30:25.559
tell when you're fibbing.
OK, I learnt it on YouTube.

30:25.560 --> 30:28.159
Opera House, please.
Oh, hang on, I'm buzzing.

30:28.160 --> 30:29.800
Hello?

30:30.800 --> 30:34.279
Oh, hi, Beth.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.279
Yeah, yeah, I don't see why not.

30:36.280 --> 30:39.960
Actually, if that's Beth,
it's probably for me too, hang on.

30:44.280 --> 30:46.256
He knows we don't have
a friend called Beth,

30:46.268 --> 30:48.079
he's going to figure
out that it's code.

30:48.080 --> 30:51.519
He's YouTubing serviettes. He's thorough.
He's terrified. Of course he's not.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.265
When you're scared of
something you start

30:53.277 --> 30:55.159
wishing it sooner, just
to get it all going.

30:55.160 --> 30:57.639
But why would he be scared
that we're getting married?

30:57.640 --> 31:00.239
It's not going to change anything,
we'll still do stuff.

31:00.240 --> 31:02.559
You need to prove it to him.
I told you to find him a new case.

31:02.560 --> 31:06.560
I'm trying. But you need to run him, OK?
Show him it's still the good old days.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.440
That just sort of happened.

31:20.720 --> 31:24.320
Sherlock, um, mate...

31:26.000 --> 31:28.079
I have...

31:28.080 --> 31:31.559
I've smelled 18 different perfumes,

31:31.560 --> 31:37.439
I've sampled nine different slices
of cake, which all tasted identical.

31:37.440 --> 31:41.439
I like the bridesmaids in purple...
Lilac. Lilac.

31:41.440 --> 31:43.719
Um, there are no more decisions
left to make.

31:43.720 --> 31:46.839
I don't even understand the decisions
that we have made.

31:46.840 --> 31:48.919
I'm faking opinions,
and it's exhausting.

31:48.920 --> 31:54.640
So, please, before she comes back...
pick something.

31:55.920 --> 31:59.359
Anything. Pick one. Pick what?

31:59.360 --> 32:01.999
A case. Your inbox is bursting.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.719
Just... get me out of here.

32:04.720 --> 32:06.919
You want to go out on a case? Now?

32:06.920 --> 32:09.840
Please. Sherlock, for me.

32:11.920 --> 32:15.359
Don't you worry about a thing,
I'll get you out of this.

32:15.360 --> 32:17.239
Oh.

32:17.240 --> 32:20.079
"Dear Mr.. Holmes,
my name is Bainbridge."

32:20.080 --> 32:22.719
"I'm a Private in Her Majesty's
Household Guard."

32:22.720 --> 32:25.079
"I'm writing to you
about a personal matter..."

32:25.080 --> 32:27.439
"One I don't care to
bring before my superiors,"

32:27.440 --> 32:28.800
"it would sound so trivial."

32:29.920 --> 32:31.759
"But I think someone's stalking me."

32:31.760 --> 32:34.439
"I'm used to tourists, it's part
of the job,"

32:34.440 --> 32:36.319
"but this is different."

32:36.320 --> 32:37.720
"Someone's watching me."

32:40.840 --> 32:42.880
"He's taking pictures of me
every day."

32:44.240 --> 32:47.640
"I don't want to mention it to the Major,
but it's really preying on my mind."

32:51.960 --> 32:54.919
Uniform fetishist?
All the nice girls like a soldier.

32:54.920 --> 32:58.919
It's "sailor". And Bainbridge
thinks his stalker is a bloke.

32:58.920 --> 33:01.359
Let's go and investigate. Please.

33:01.360 --> 33:03.559
Elite guard. 40 enlisted
men and officers.

33:03.560 --> 33:05.839
Why this particular Grenadier?
Curious.

33:05.840 --> 33:09.559
Now you're talking. OK.
Bye!

33:09.560 --> 33:12.799
Er, we're just going to...
I need, um, Sherlock to help me

33:12.800 --> 33:15.319
choose some er... Ties.
Socks.

33:15.320 --> 33:16.719
Why don't we go with socks? Yeah.

33:16.720 --> 33:18.599
I mean, you've got to get
the right ones.

33:18.600 --> 33:22.039
Exactly, to go with my...
Tie. Outfit.

33:22.040 --> 33:25.080
That'll take a while, right?
Is my coat in there? Yes.

33:27.280 --> 33:29.839
I'm just going to take him
out for a bit. Run him.

33:29.840 --> 33:32.199
I know. You said
you'd find him a case. Hmm.

33:32.200 --> 33:34.000
Coming, Sherlock? Coming!

33:42.080 --> 33:44.120
Taxi!

33:58.200 --> 34:00.520
Company halt!

34:05.120 --> 34:06.720
Right turn!

34:08.120 --> 34:10.518
We're here to see
Private Stephen Bainbridge.

34:10.520 --> 34:11.998
He's on duty right now, sir.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.039
But I'll certainly
let him know when he's free.

34:14.040 --> 34:15.359
And when will that be?

34:15.360 --> 34:17.280
Another hour.

34:30.840 --> 34:32.998
Do you think they give them classes?

34:33.000 --> 34:34.438
Classes?

34:34.440 --> 34:37.719
How to resist the temptation
to scratch their behinds.

34:37.719 --> 34:41.839
Afferent neurons in
the peripheral nervous system.

34:41.840 --> 34:43.279
Bum-itch.

34:43.280 --> 34:44.280
Oh.

34:48.960 --> 34:51.279
So why don't you see him any more?

34:51.280 --> 34:54.319
Who? Your previous commander, Sholto.

34:54.320 --> 34:56.279
Previous commander?

34:56.280 --> 34:57.679
I meant ex.

34:57.680 --> 35:00.079
"Previous" suggests that
I currently have a commander.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.479
Which you don't. Which I don't.
Of course you don't.

35:03.480 --> 35:05.599
He was decorated, wasn't he?
A war hero?

35:05.600 --> 35:07.000
Not to everyone.

35:08.160 --> 35:09.919
He led a team of crows into battle.

35:09.920 --> 35:11.119
Crows?

35:11.120 --> 35:14.239
New recruits. It's standard
procedure - break the new boys in.

35:14.240 --> 35:15.400
But it went wrong.

35:16.640 --> 35:19.479
They all died,
he was the only survivor.

35:19.480 --> 35:21.586
The press and families gave
him hell, he gets more

35:21.598 --> 35:23.839
death threats than you. Oh,
I wouldn't count on that.

35:23.840 --> 35:27.679
And why have you suddenly taken
an interest in another human being?

35:27.680 --> 35:29.240
I'm "chatting".

35:33.280 --> 35:35.439
I won't be trying THAT again.

35:35.440 --> 35:39.559
Changing the subject completely...

35:39.560 --> 35:44.159
you know it won't alter anything,
right, me and Mary getting married?

35:44.160 --> 35:46.079
We'll still be doing all this.

35:46.080 --> 35:48.279
Oh, good. If you were worried.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.600
I wasn't worried.

35:51.600 --> 35:52.600
Hmm.

35:54.400 --> 35:56.639
The thing about Mary,

35:56.640 --> 35:59.000
she has completely
turned my life around.

36:00.960 --> 36:02.440
Changed everything.

36:03.960 --> 36:05.279
But, for the record,

36:05.280 --> 36:08.519
over the last few years there are
two people who have done that,

36:08.520 --> 36:12.439
and the other one is...

36:12.440 --> 36:14.080
a complete dickhead.

37:46.200 --> 37:48.159
Can I ask what this
is in connection with?

37:48.160 --> 37:52.359
Private Bainbridge contacted us
about a personal matter, sir.

37:52.360 --> 37:55.239
Nothing's personal
when it concerns my troops.

37:55.240 --> 37:57.279
What do you really want?

37:57.280 --> 38:00.119
I'm here on a legitimate enquiry.

38:00.120 --> 38:03.999
Are you press? Digging for some
bloody Royal story or something?

38:04.000 --> 38:05.959
No, sir, I'm Captain John Watson,

38:05.960 --> 38:08.279
Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers.

38:08.280 --> 38:09.839
Retired.

38:09.840 --> 38:12.920
You could be a used-car
salesman now, for all I know.

38:15.160 --> 38:17.159
Bainbridge?

38:17.160 --> 38:18.920
Gentleman here to see you.

38:20.440 --> 38:21.960
Bainbridge!

38:30.400 --> 38:32.199
I know you, don't I?

38:32.200 --> 38:33.440
Hmm?

38:36.080 --> 38:38.559
I've seen you in the papers.

38:38.560 --> 38:41.239
You hang around with that detective,

38:41.240 --> 38:42.920
the one with the silly hat.

38:44.640 --> 38:47.119
What the hell does Bainbridge
want with a detective?

38:47.120 --> 38:48.919
I'm afraid I'm not at liberty to say.

38:48.920 --> 38:52.119
You're not at liberty to say?
He's a soldier in my regiment.

38:52.120 --> 38:55.799
I'll be damned if he's going to get up to
cloak-and-dagger nonsense like this. Sir!

38:55.800 --> 38:58.439
Sir! What's going on?
It's Bainbridge, sir.

38:58.440 --> 38:59.480
He's dead.

39:08.760 --> 39:12.279
My God!

39:12.280 --> 39:15.239
Ah! No, let me take a look,
sir, I'm a doctor.

39:15.240 --> 39:16.439
What?

39:16.440 --> 39:17.679
Sergeant, arrest this man!

39:17.680 --> 39:19.119
What? No, no! I'm a doctor!

39:19.120 --> 39:21.159
Oh, you're a doctor
now too? Sergeant.

39:21.160 --> 39:22.399
Let me examine him, please!

39:22.400 --> 39:24.359
Sir, caught this one
snooping around.

39:24.360 --> 39:25.839
Is that what this is all about?

39:25.840 --> 39:28.039
Distracting me, so that
this man could get in here

39:28.040 --> 39:29.479
and kill Bainbridge? Don't be...

39:29.480 --> 39:31.599
Kill him with what?
Where's the weapon? What?

39:31.600 --> 39:33.959
Where's the weapon?
Go on, search me - no weapon.

39:33.960 --> 39:36.679
Bainbridge was on parade,
he came off duty five minutes ago.

39:36.680 --> 39:38.519
When's this supposed
to have happened?

39:38.520 --> 39:41.799
You obviously stabbed him before
he got into the shower. No. No?!

39:41.800 --> 39:43.888
He's soaking wet and there's
shampoo in his hair.

39:43.900 --> 39:45.999
He got into the shower,
then someone stabbed him.

39:46.000 --> 39:48.759
The cubicle was locked from the
inside, sir. I had to break it open.

39:48.760 --> 39:52.359
You must have climbed over the top. But
then I'd be soaking wet too, wouldn't I?

39:52.360 --> 39:55.319
Major, please! I'm John Watson,
Fifth Northumberland Fusiliers,

39:55.320 --> 39:57.959
three years in Afghanistan,
a veteran of Kandahar, Helmand

39:57.960 --> 39:59.559
and Bart's bloody Hospital!

39:59.560 --> 40:01.400
Let me examine this body!

40:08.360 --> 40:09.959
Thank you.

40:09.960 --> 40:11.799
Suicide?

40:11.800 --> 40:13.560
No. The weapon again, no knife.

40:16.200 --> 40:20.480
Now, there is a wound
to the abdomen.

40:21.960 --> 40:23.119
Incredibly fine.

40:23.120 --> 40:25.599
Man stabbed to death,
no murder weapon.

40:25.600 --> 40:27.320
Door locked from the inside.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.159
Only one way in or out
of here. Sherlock...

40:30.160 --> 40:32.119
Hmm? He's still breathing.

40:32.120 --> 40:33.919
Oh, my God!

40:33.920 --> 40:36.039
What do we do?
Give me your scarf. What?

40:36.040 --> 40:38.359
Quickly, now! Call an ambulance!

40:38.360 --> 40:40.359
What? Call an ambulance, now!

40:40.360 --> 40:41.759
Do it!

40:41.760 --> 40:44.279
Nurse, press here, hard.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.679
Nurse? Yeah, I'm making do.

40:45.680 --> 40:47.479
Keep pressure on that wound.

40:47.480 --> 40:49.680
Stephen? Stephen, stay with me.

40:51.760 --> 40:53.839
Private Bainbridge had
just come off guard duty.

40:53.840 --> 40:56.239
He'd stood there for hours,
plenty of people watching,

40:56.240 --> 40:57.479
nothing apparently wrong.

40:57.480 --> 40:59.879
He came off duty and
within minutes was nearly dead

40:59.880 --> 41:02.039
from a wound in his stomach,

41:02.040 --> 41:03.399
but there was no weapon.

41:03.400 --> 41:05.159
Where did it go?

41:05.160 --> 41:07.519
Ladies and gentlemen,
I invite you to consider this -

41:07.520 --> 41:09.839
a murderer who can
walk through walls,

41:09.840 --> 41:12.079
a weapon that can vanish.
But in all of this,

41:12.080 --> 41:15.360
there is only one element which can
be said to be truly remarkable.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.200
Would anyone like to make a guess?

41:22.880 --> 41:24.039
Come on, come on,

41:24.040 --> 41:26.880
there is actually an element
of Q&A to all of this.

41:29.920 --> 41:32.559
Scotland Yard,
have you got a theory?

41:32.560 --> 41:36.719
Yeah, you, you're a detective,
broadly speaking. Got a theory?

41:36.720 --> 41:39.559
Er, um, if the, er...
If the... If the...

41:39.560 --> 41:42.160
If the blade was
propelled through the, erm...

41:44.160 --> 41:46.599
grating in the air vent,

41:46.600 --> 41:50.079
maybe a ballista
or a catapult, um...

41:50.080 --> 41:52.719
Somebody tiny could crawl in there.

41:52.720 --> 41:55.359
So, yeah, we're looking
for a dwarf.

41:55.360 --> 41:56.679
Brilliant.

41:56.680 --> 41:57.959
Really? No.

41:57.960 --> 41:59.119
Next?

41:59.120 --> 42:00.559
(He stabbed hiMs..elf.)

42:00.560 --> 42:01.959
Hello, who was that?

42:01.960 --> 42:03.600
Tom?

42:06.560 --> 42:07.560
Got a theory?

42:10.120 --> 42:15.199
Attempted suicide, with a blade
made of compacted blood and bone.

42:15.200 --> 42:17.519
Broke after piercing his abdomen,

42:17.520 --> 42:21.359
like a meat... dagger.

42:21.360 --> 42:22.999
A meat dagger?

42:23.000 --> 42:24.960
Yes.
(Sit down.)

42:26.200 --> 42:27.200
No.

42:28.280 --> 42:31.639
There was one feature,
and only one feature, of interest

42:31.640 --> 42:33.559
in the whole of this baffling case,

42:33.560 --> 42:37.119
and quite frankly it was
the usual - John Watson.

42:37.120 --> 42:40.640
Who, while I was trying to solve
a murder, instead saved a life.

42:42.280 --> 42:44.359
There are mysteries worth solving

42:44.360 --> 42:46.000
and stories worth telling.

42:47.920 --> 42:49.319
The best and bravest man I know

42:49.320 --> 42:51.599
and, on top of that,
he actually knows how to do stuff.

42:51.600 --> 42:54.399
Except wedding planning and
serviettes, he's rubbish at those.

42:54.400 --> 42:55.879
Hmm. The case itself remains

42:55.880 --> 42:59.359
the most ingenious and brilliantly
planned murder, or attempted murder,

42:59.360 --> 43:01.759
I've ever had
the pleasure to encounter.

43:01.760 --> 43:05.759
The most perfect locked-room
mystery of which I am aware.

43:05.760 --> 43:07.679
However, I'm not just here
to praise John,

43:07.680 --> 43:09.799
I'm also here to embarrass him,
so let's move on to...

43:09.800 --> 43:11.119
No, wait... How was it done?

43:11.120 --> 43:12.920
How was what done? The stabbing?

43:15.200 --> 43:16.799
I'm afraid I don't know.

43:16.800 --> 43:18.999
I didn't solve that one.

43:19.000 --> 43:22.799
It can happen sometimes,
it's very, very disappointing.

43:22.800 --> 43:25.319
Embarrassment leads me on
to the stag night.

43:25.320 --> 43:27.399
Of course there's
hours of material here,

43:27.400 --> 43:29.840
but I've cut it down
to the really good bits.

43:31.440 --> 43:33.319
Murder scenes?

43:33.320 --> 43:36.079
Locations of murders?

43:36.080 --> 43:37.519
Hmm, pub crawl, themed.

43:37.520 --> 43:40.039
Yeah, but why can't you just
do Underground stations?

43:40.040 --> 43:42.999
It lacks the personal touch. We're
going to go for a drink in every...

43:43.000 --> 43:45.399
In every street where you've
found a corpse. Delightful!

43:45.400 --> 43:46.679
Where do I come in?

43:46.680 --> 43:49.399
Don't want to get ill.
That would ruin it, spoil the mood.

43:49.400 --> 43:51.879
You're a graduate chemist,
can't you just work it out?

43:51.880 --> 43:53.760
I lack the practical experience.

43:55.400 --> 43:56.999
Meaning you think I like a drink?

43:57.000 --> 43:59.240
Occasionally.
That I'm a drunk. No... No.

44:03.360 --> 44:05.839
You look... well.

44:05.840 --> 44:07.519
I am.

44:07.520 --> 44:09.000
How's...

44:11.640 --> 44:13.399
Tom?

44:13.400 --> 44:14.519
Not a sociopath.

44:14.520 --> 44:15.599
Still? Good.

44:15.600 --> 44:17.760
And we're having quite a lot of sex.

44:20.400 --> 44:23.959
OK. I want you to calculate
John's ideal intake, and mine,

44:23.960 --> 44:26.119
to remain in the sweet spot
for the whole evening.

44:26.120 --> 44:27.279
Light-headed - good.

44:27.280 --> 44:29.759
Urinating in wardrobes - bad.

44:29.760 --> 44:31.039
Hmm.

44:31.040 --> 44:33.559
Two, erm... beers, please.

44:33.560 --> 44:34.639
Pints?

44:34.640 --> 44:37.440
443.7 millilitres.

44:40.320 --> 44:41.440
Ah.

44:45.760 --> 44:47.640
What, are we on a schedule?

44:48.800 --> 44:50.320
You'll thank me.

45:06.600 --> 45:08.200
Cheers. Cheers.

45:14.440 --> 45:15.639
Over there. What?

45:15.640 --> 45:17.919
Toilets - any second now
you're going to need...

45:17.920 --> 45:20.479
Hang on, tell me after.
I need the loo. Hmm, on schedule.

45:20.480 --> 45:22.960
Eh? Nothing. Go!

45:28.240 --> 45:29.919
How long? Sorry?

45:29.920 --> 45:31.399
Your visit.

45:31.400 --> 45:34.759
Estimate approximate
volume discharge...

45:34.760 --> 45:36.160
Stop talking now.

45:40.400 --> 45:44.000
Oh, quick, one more. He mustn't see.

45:53.400 --> 45:55.200
Here you go. Cheers.

45:58.520 --> 46:03.480
I know ash! Don't tell me I don't!

46:06.280 --> 46:10.240
All right, enough!
That's... Stand up.

46:12.120 --> 46:15.440
Ash. I know ash.

46:21.720 --> 46:23.880
I have an international reputation.

46:25.920 --> 46:28.559
Do you have
an international reputation?

46:28.560 --> 46:31.760
No, I don't have
an international reputation. No.

46:34.640 --> 46:36.480
And I can't even remember what for.

46:39.720 --> 46:44.480
It's crime... something or other.

46:46.640 --> 46:48.879
Oh, what are you doing back?

46:48.880 --> 46:50.679
I thought you were
going to be up late.

46:50.680 --> 46:52.760
Ah, Hudders. What time is it?

46:54.160 --> 46:55.760
You've only been out two hours.

47:07.240 --> 47:08.759
Am I a vegetable?

47:08.760 --> 47:11.400
You or the... thing...? Pffrrrt!

47:12.920 --> 47:14.039
Funny!

47:14.040 --> 47:15.279
Thank you.

47:15.280 --> 47:18.480
Come on. No, you're not
a vegetable. It's your go.

47:20.160 --> 47:23.639
Erm... am I human?

47:23.640 --> 47:24.879
Sometimes.

47:24.880 --> 47:26.239
Can't have sometimes.

47:26.240 --> 47:27.439
It has to be, um...

47:27.440 --> 47:31.039
Yes, you're human.
Yes, I know, OK. And am I a man?

47:31.040 --> 47:32.520
Yep. Tall?

47:34.160 --> 47:35.759
Not as tall as people think.

47:35.760 --> 47:37.439
Hmm. Nice?

47:37.440 --> 47:38.919
Ish.

47:38.920 --> 47:39.999
Clever?

47:40.000 --> 47:41.039
I would say so.

47:41.040 --> 47:42.319
You would.

47:42.320 --> 47:44.159
Hmm, am I important?

47:44.160 --> 47:45.719
To some people.

47:45.720 --> 47:48.399
Do people like me?

47:48.400 --> 47:50.199
Erm, no they don't.

47:50.200 --> 47:53.239
You tend to rub them up
the wrong way.

47:53.240 --> 47:54.839
OK.

47:54.840 --> 47:56.920
Am I the current King of England?

47:59.200 --> 48:00.959
You know we don't have a King.

48:00.960 --> 48:03.119
Don't we? No.

48:03.120 --> 48:05.080
Your go.

48:11.760 --> 48:14.360
I don't mind. Am I a woman?

48:16.400 --> 48:18.440
What?

48:19.440 --> 48:20.679
Yes.

48:20.680 --> 48:23.400
Am I... pretty?

48:24.760 --> 48:26.000
This?

48:27.760 --> 48:30.879
Beauty is a construct based
entirely on childhood impressions,

48:30.880 --> 48:32.639
influences and role models.

48:32.640 --> 48:35.120
Yeah, but am I a pretty lady?

48:37.640 --> 48:41.199
I don't know who you are, I don't
know who you're supposed to be.

48:41.200 --> 48:42.399
You picked the name!

48:42.400 --> 48:44.439
But I picked it at random
from the papers.

48:44.440 --> 48:47.839
You're not really getting the hang
of this game, are you, Sherlock?

48:47.840 --> 48:52.279
So I am human, I'm not as tall
as people think I am. I'm...

48:52.280 --> 48:54.399
I'm nice-ish, clever,

48:54.400 --> 48:55.999
important to some people.

48:56.000 --> 48:58.840
But I tend to rub them up
the wrong way.

49:00.400 --> 49:01.839
Got it.

49:01.840 --> 49:03.559
Go on, then. I'm you, aren't I?

49:03.560 --> 49:04.560
Client!

49:06.520 --> 49:07.839
Hello.

49:07.840 --> 49:10.039
Hello. Come on.

49:10.040 --> 49:12.040
Which one of you is Sherlock Holmes?

49:17.520 --> 49:19.199
I don't... a lot.

49:19.200 --> 49:22.199
I mean, I don't date all that much.

49:22.200 --> 49:27.159
And he seemed nice, you know?

49:27.160 --> 49:30.039
We seemed to automatically connect.

49:30.040 --> 49:31.479
We had one night,

49:31.480 --> 49:35.199
dinner, such interesting
conversation.

49:35.200 --> 49:37.439
It was lovely.

49:37.440 --> 49:38.959
To be honest,

49:38.960 --> 49:41.719
I'd love to have gone further,

49:41.720 --> 49:45.919
but I thought, no, this is special,

49:45.920 --> 49:47.679
let's take it slowly.

49:47.680 --> 49:49.239
Exchanged numbers,

49:49.240 --> 49:51.760
he said he'd get in touch
and then...

49:55.040 --> 50:00.679
Maybe he wasn't quite
as keen as I was,

50:00.680 --> 50:04.199
but I just thought

50:04.200 --> 50:07.480
at least he'd call
to say that we were finished.

50:14.440 --> 50:16.559
I went round there,

50:16.560 --> 50:19.879
to his flat, no trace of him.

50:19.880 --> 50:24.319
Mr.. Holmes, I honestly think

50:24.320 --> 50:28.440
I had dinner with a ghost.

50:32.520 --> 50:34.120
Mr.. Holmes?

50:39.320 --> 50:41.239
With a ghost, Mr.. Holmes!

50:41.240 --> 50:45.720
Boring, boring, boring.
No... fascinating.

50:46.960 --> 50:48.639
John. John! Wake up.

50:48.640 --> 50:52.239
I apologise about my...
You know... Him.

50:52.240 --> 50:53.600
Rude. Rude!

50:55.280 --> 50:57.399
I checked with the landlord

50:57.400 --> 51:00.599
and the man who lived there died.

51:00.600 --> 51:02.479
Heart attack.

51:02.480 --> 51:06.439
And there we are
having dinner one week on.

51:06.440 --> 51:09.879
And I found this thing online,

51:09.880 --> 51:12.359
a sort of chatroom thing,

51:12.360 --> 51:16.599
for girls who think they're dating
men from the spirit world.

51:16.600 --> 51:20.039
Don't worry, I'll find him
in ten minutes.

51:20.040 --> 51:21.319
What's your dog's name?

51:21.320 --> 51:23.959
Yeah, I'm there if you want it...
John, wake up.

51:23.960 --> 51:26.479
Went to... Yeah.

51:26.480 --> 51:28.160
The game is... something.

51:29.160 --> 51:30.239
On?

51:30.240 --> 51:31.879
Yeah, that, that.

51:31.880 --> 51:33.040
OK.

51:42.400 --> 51:44.519
Oh, it's nice.

51:44.520 --> 51:46.240
Nice place.

51:51.320 --> 51:53.439
See anything? Hmm?

51:53.440 --> 51:55.159
Any clues, Mr.. Holmes?

51:55.160 --> 51:57.200
Oh, errrm...

52:18.320 --> 52:20.160
I'm just going to whip this out.

52:37.120 --> 52:39.879
You all right?
Hmm? Yeah, he's clueing. What?

52:39.880 --> 52:41.800
He's... Hmm? He's clueing for looks.

52:53.040 --> 52:54.880
Mr.. Holmes?

52:59.920 --> 53:02.519
Mr.. Holmes! I'm calling
the police. Oh, no...

53:02.520 --> 53:04.239
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

53:04.240 --> 53:06.479
No, look, this is
a famous detective,

53:06.480 --> 53:09.279
it's Sherlock Holmes and
his partner, John Hamish Watson.

53:09.280 --> 53:10.679
What do you think you're doing?

53:10.680 --> 53:15.400
Don't compromise the
integrity of the...

53:20.640 --> 53:21.880
Crime scene.

53:28.080 --> 53:29.720
Yeah, that.

53:49.720 --> 53:51.000
Wakey-wakey!

53:51.440 --> 53:52.719
Oh, my God.

53:52.720 --> 53:54.599
Greg... Is that Greg?

53:54.600 --> 53:56.999
Get up. I'm going to
put you two in a taxi.

53:57.000 --> 53:59.679
I managed to square things
with the desk sergeant.

53:59.680 --> 54:02.199
Ha! What a couple of lightweights -

54:02.200 --> 54:04.239
you couldn't even make it
to closing time!

54:04.240 --> 54:05.760
- Can you whisper?
- Not really!

54:09.640 --> 54:11.480
Come on.

54:23.200 --> 54:26.559
Well, thanks for a...

54:26.560 --> 54:28.919
You know... an evening.

54:28.920 --> 54:29.920
It was awful.

54:29.921 --> 54:32.999
Yeah. I was going to pretend, but...

54:33.000 --> 54:34.639
it was, truly.

54:34.640 --> 54:37.279
That woman, Tessa... What?

54:37.280 --> 54:39.759
Dated a ghost, most interesting
case for months.

54:39.760 --> 54:41.320
What a wasted opportunity!

54:42.840 --> 54:44.360
OK.

54:50.360 --> 54:51.759
How are you feeling?

54:51.760 --> 54:53.120
Hmm.

54:54.520 --> 54:56.599
It's just like old times,
having you back here.

54:56.600 --> 55:00.879
I thought I'd make your
favourite, one last time.

55:00.880 --> 55:03.799
Oh. Don't sound so final about it,

55:03.800 --> 55:06.719
I will be visiting, you know.
Ooh, I've heard that one before!

55:06.720 --> 55:08.759
No, it's different now,
though, isn't it?

55:08.760 --> 55:10.879
It's different to when
we thought we'd lost him.

55:10.880 --> 55:13.079
Well, marriage
changes everything, John.

55:13.080 --> 55:17.079
Does it? Yeah. You might not
think it, but it does.

55:17.080 --> 55:19.159
It's a different phase in your life.

55:19.160 --> 55:22.079
You meet knew people,
cos you're a couple,

55:22.080 --> 55:26.039
and then you just let
your old friends slip away.

55:26.040 --> 55:29.239
It won't be like that.
Well, if you've found the right one,

55:29.240 --> 55:32.319
the person that you click with,
it's the best thing in the world.

55:32.320 --> 55:35.359
Well, I have. I know I have.
Oh, I'm sure.

55:35.360 --> 55:36.559
She's lovely.

55:36.560 --> 55:38.879
Yeah, I think so. What about you?

55:38.880 --> 55:40.159
Me?

55:40.160 --> 55:43.439
Did you think you'd found the right
one when you married Mr.. Hudson?

55:43.440 --> 55:46.519
No. It was just
a whirlwind thing for us.

55:46.520 --> 55:49.799
I knew it wouldn't work, but I just
got sort of swept along. Right.

55:49.800 --> 55:51.999
And then we moved to Florida.

55:52.000 --> 55:53.439
We had a fantastic time,

55:53.440 --> 55:56.679
but of course I didn't know
what he was up to. (The drugs.)

55:56.680 --> 55:59.039
Drugs?! He was running, erm...

55:59.040 --> 56:00.999
Oh, what do you call it?

56:01.000 --> 56:05.039
Erm... A... cartel.

56:05.040 --> 56:07.039
And got in with a really bad crowd.

56:07.040 --> 56:10.319
Right. And then I found out
about all the other women.

56:10.320 --> 56:12.119
I didn't have a clue.

56:12.120 --> 56:16.519
So, when he was actually arrested
for blowing someone's head off,

56:16.520 --> 56:20.000
it was quite a relief, to be honest.

56:21.440 --> 56:22.599
Oh.

56:22.600 --> 56:25.719
It was purely physical
between me and Frank.

56:25.720 --> 56:28.079
We couldn't keep
our hands off each other.

56:28.080 --> 56:30.639
I know, there was one night...

56:30.640 --> 56:32.080
Oh, is that Sherlock?

56:32.720 --> 56:33.919
Is it?

56:33.920 --> 56:35.160
That's Sherlock.

56:40.200 --> 56:41.840
Urgh...

56:55.640 --> 56:57.439
There are going to be others.

56:57.440 --> 57:00.479
Others? VictiMs.., women.

57:00.480 --> 57:02.599
Most ghosts tend to
haunt a single house.

57:02.600 --> 57:05.160
This ghost, however,
is willing to commute. Look.

57:26.680 --> 57:30.079
Hmm... Not you. Not you.

57:30.080 --> 57:32.279
Not you. Not you. Not you. Not you.

57:32.280 --> 57:34.399
Not you. Not you.

57:34.400 --> 57:36.239
Not you.

57:36.240 --> 57:37.799
Not you. Not you.

57:37.800 --> 57:40.919
Hmm... Not you.

57:40.920 --> 57:44.319
Not you. Not you. Not you.
Not you. Not you. Not you.

57:44.320 --> 57:46.719
Not you. Not you.
Not you. Not you. Not you.

57:46.720 --> 57:47.879
Not you, you, you, or you, or you.

57:47.880 --> 57:52.159
Or not you, not you, not you,
not you, not you, not you.

57:52.160 --> 57:54.920
Not you.

58:01.520 --> 58:03.359
Hi.

58:03.360 --> 58:04.880
Gail.

58:10.200 --> 58:11.720
Charlotte.

58:13.200 --> 58:15.440
Robyn.

58:17.960 --> 58:19.480
Vicky.

58:27.160 --> 58:29.239
How did you meet?

58:29.240 --> 58:31.479
Came up to me in a pub.
Same gym as me.

58:31.480 --> 58:33.519
We just got chatting on the bus.

58:33.520 --> 58:34.599
Online.

58:34.600 --> 58:36.599
Name? Told you.

58:36.600 --> 58:38.399
His name. Oscar.

58:38.400 --> 58:40.279
Mike. Terry.

58:40.280 --> 58:42.839
Erm... Love Monkey.

58:42.840 --> 58:44.599
Your place?

58:44.600 --> 58:45.880
His place.

58:47.080 --> 58:48.320
Address?

58:52.520 --> 58:53.719
Nothing happened.

58:53.720 --> 58:56.799
It was just... very romantic.

58:56.800 --> 58:59.519
Four women in four nights.
He must have something special.

58:59.520 --> 59:01.199
He was very charming. He listened.

59:01.200 --> 59:02.359
He was sweet.

59:02.360 --> 59:05.719
He had a lovely... You OK?

59:05.720 --> 59:09.239
You've let your food go cold.
Mr..s Hudson will play hell.

59:09.240 --> 59:10.520
Not now, John.

59:14.000 --> 59:15.999
Sorry about that.

59:16.000 --> 59:17.599
He had a lovely manner.

59:17.600 --> 59:20.639
Different names,
different addresses.

59:20.640 --> 59:21.999
Describe him.

59:22.000 --> 59:23.079
Short blonde hair.

59:23.080 --> 59:24.479
Dark hair. Long.

59:24.480 --> 59:26.119
Ginger. I like gingers.

59:26.120 --> 59:27.319
Couldn't tell.

59:27.320 --> 59:29.200
He had a mask on.

59:31.200 --> 59:33.279
He's stealing
the identity of corpses,

59:33.280 --> 59:36.559
getting their names
from the obituary columns.

59:36.560 --> 59:37.879
All single men.

59:37.880 --> 59:39.319
He's using the dead man's flat

59:39.320 --> 59:41.959
under the assumption
it will be empty for a while.

59:41.960 --> 59:43.319
Free love nest.

59:43.320 --> 59:44.320
I feel sick.

59:44.320 --> 59:45.320
It's gruesome.

59:45.321 --> 59:48.080
That's awful. Clever... Bastard!

59:52.320 --> 59:54.599
Hello, Tessa.

59:54.600 --> 59:56.079
Meanwhile, back to business.

59:56.080 --> 59:57.840
No-one wants to use
a dead man's home.

59:59.240 --> 01:00:01.279
At least not until
it's been cleared.

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.439
So, he disguises hiMs..elf.

01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.359
Steals the man's home,
steals his identity.

01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.999
But only for one night.
Then he's gone.

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:12.159
He's not a ghost, John.
He's a Mayfly.

01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:13.520
He lives for a day.

01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:18.639
So, what was it
he was looking for?

01:00:18.640 --> 01:00:19.679
Job?

01:00:19.680 --> 01:00:21.159
Gardener. Cook.

01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.759
Private nurse. I do security work.

01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:23.960
Maid.

01:00:25.240 --> 01:00:27.120
Obvious. You all work
for the same person.

01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.039
No, no, not the same employer. Damn!

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:45.439
Come on, we can do this.

01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:46.559
Ideal night out?

01:00:46.560 --> 01:00:47.879
Clay-pigeon shooting.

01:00:47.880 --> 01:00:48.999
Line dancing.

01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.079
Pictures.

01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.879
Wine in front of the telly.

01:00:51.880 --> 01:00:53.600
Dungeon.

01:00:54.680 --> 01:00:56.519
Make-up? Clarins.

01:00:56.520 --> 01:00:57.919
No7.

01:00:57.920 --> 01:00:59.959
Maybelline. Nothing special.

01:00:59.960 --> 01:01:00.920
Whatever's cheap.

01:01:00.921 --> 01:01:02.599
Perfume?

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:04.679
Chanel. Chanel. Chanel.

01:01:04.680 --> 01:01:07.120
Chanel. Estee Lauder.

01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:09.759
Ideal man?

01:01:09.760 --> 01:01:11.039
George Clooney.

01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.559
Oh...! Home-loving.

01:01:12.560 --> 01:01:14.519
He'd have to like cuddling.

01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:17.079
Caring. Ten things.

01:01:17.080 --> 01:01:19.279
One - someone who isn't
competitive with other men.

01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:21.399
Two - someone who isn't constantly

01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.879
trying to define hiMs..elf
by his masculinity...

01:01:24.880 --> 01:01:28.719
There's a unifying
factor, there has to be.

01:01:28.720 --> 01:01:30.600
None of you reported
anything stolen.

01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.679
Security guard, gardener, cook,
maid, private nurse.

01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:38.559
He's romancing his way
up a pecking order.

01:01:38.560 --> 01:01:41.520
Somebody's pecking order.
Come on, think. Unless...

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:44.639
Do you have a secret
you've never told anyone?

01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.159
No.

01:01:46.160 --> 01:01:48.039
Gotcha! What do you mean?

01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:50.519
Everyone has secrets and
they all replied too quickly.

01:01:50.520 --> 01:01:53.319
Got to go. See you. No... Wait!
Bye-bye. Wait!

01:01:53.320 --> 01:01:56.039
Sorry, sexy, some secrets
have to stay secret.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.840
Enjoy the wedding.

01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:03.679
Why? WHY would he date all of those
women and not return their calls?

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:06.199
You're missing
the obvious, mate. Am I?

01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.639
He's a man.

01:02:07.640 --> 01:02:09.719
But why would he
change his identity?

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:11.120
Maybe he's married.

01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:16.039
Oh... Married.

01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:17.159
Obvious, really.

01:02:17.160 --> 01:02:18.879
Our Mayfly Man
was trying to escape

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.599
the suffocating
chains of domesticity

01:02:20.600 --> 01:02:22.839
and instead of endless nights in
watching the telly

01:02:22.840 --> 01:02:26.519
or going to barbecues with the awful,
dreadful, boring people he couldn't stand,

01:02:26.520 --> 01:02:29.920
he used his wits, cleverness and powers
of disguise to play the field. He was...

01:02:32.640 --> 01:02:34.279
On second thoughts,

01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:37.279
I probably should have told you
about the elephant in the room.

01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.919
However, it does help
to further illustrate

01:02:39.920 --> 01:02:41.799
how invaluable John is to me.

01:02:41.800 --> 01:02:45.479
I can read a crime scene the way
he can understand a human being.

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:48.439
I used to think that's what made me
special - quite frankly I still do.

01:02:48.440 --> 01:02:49.639
But a word to the wise,

01:02:49.640 --> 01:02:52.479
should any of you require
the services of either of us,

01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:54.319
I will solve your murder,

01:02:54.320 --> 01:02:57.199
but it takes John Watson
to save your life.

01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:58.799
Trust me on that, I should know,

01:02:58.800 --> 01:03:01.040
he's saved mine so many times
and in so many ways.

01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:07.119
This blog is the story of two men

01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:10.599
and their, frankly,
ridiculous adventures

01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:13.480
of murder, mystery and mayhem.

01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:18.280
But from now on,
there's a new story.

01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:21.680
A bigger adventure.

01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:24.599
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:29.199
pray, charge your glasses
and be upstanding.

01:03:29.200 --> 01:03:31.239
Today begin the adventures

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:33.119
of Mary Elizabeth Watson

01:03:33.120 --> 01:03:34.959
and John Hamish Watson.

01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:39.080
The two reasons why
every single one of us is...

01:03:56.800 --> 01:03:57.959
What did you say?

01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:04.639
You said... "John
Hamish Watson."

01:04:04.640 --> 01:04:07.080
You said that. You said "Hamish."

01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:10.599
This is a famous detective,
it's Sherlock Holmes

01:04:10.600 --> 01:04:12.399
and his partner, John Hamish Watson.

01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.319
How did you know?

01:04:14.320 --> 01:04:16.519
How did YOU know his middle name?

01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:18.640
He never tells anyone, he hates it.

01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:24.519
John "H" Watson?

01:04:24.520 --> 01:04:25.960
Yep.

01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.279
Henry? Shut up.

01:04:35.280 --> 01:04:36.519
Humphrey?

01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:38.239
Shut up.

01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:39.240
Higgins?

01:04:41.080 --> 01:04:43.159
'Go away!'

01:04:43.160 --> 01:04:45.839
It took him years to confide in me.

01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:49.959
Oh... That's my
birth certificate.

01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:51.200
Yep.

01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:57.840
And the woman - she knew.

01:05:00.040 --> 01:05:01.760
Hamish.

01:05:03.120 --> 01:05:04.799
John Hamish Watson,

01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:07.839
just if you were
looking for baby names.

01:05:07.840 --> 01:05:09.680
God knows where she is.

01:05:14.480 --> 01:05:16.400
Out of my head, I am busy!

01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:20.279
There's only one time
that name's been made public.

01:05:20.280 --> 01:05:22.199
Does it have to be on the invitation?

01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:24.199
It's your name.

01:05:24.200 --> 01:05:25.960
It's traditional... It's funny...

01:05:29.040 --> 01:05:30.520
'Enjoy the wedding...'

01:05:35.200 --> 01:05:36.639
Enjoy the wedding.

01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:38.759
The wedding.
You knew about the wedding.

01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.279
More importantly, you'd seen
a wedding invitation.

01:05:41.280 --> 01:05:43.519
Now barely 100 people
had seen that invitation.

01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.639
The Mayfly Man only saw five women.

01:05:45.640 --> 01:05:47.799
For one person
to be in both groups...

01:05:47.800 --> 01:05:49.399
could be a coincidence.

01:05:49.400 --> 01:05:51.519
Oh, Sherlock!

01:05:51.520 --> 01:05:53.719
What do we say about coincidences?

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.159
The universe is rarely so lazy.

01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:58.199
So, the balance of probability is?
Someone went to great lengths

01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:00.522
to find out something about this wedding.
What great

01:06:00.534 --> 01:06:02.559
lengths? They lied.
Assumed false identities.

01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:04.519
Which suggests? Criminal intent.

01:06:04.520 --> 01:06:05.759
Also suggests?

01:06:05.760 --> 01:06:07.159
Intelligence, planning.

01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:09.600
Clearly. But more importantly?

01:06:11.120 --> 01:06:12.480
The Mayfly Man.

01:06:13.640 --> 01:06:17.079
The Mayfly Man is... Here today!

01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.880
Ooh, sorry. I...

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.519
Another glass, sir?

01:06:22.520 --> 01:06:24.319
Thank you, yes, thank you. Yes.

01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:26.600
Something's going to happen,
right here.

01:06:29.920 --> 01:06:31.039
Now, where were we?

01:06:31.040 --> 01:06:32.040
Could be any second.

01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:37.159
You have control of the room.

01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:38.719
Ah, yes.

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:41.839
Raising glasses and standing up.
Very good. Thank you.

01:06:41.840 --> 01:06:43.279
Don't lose it.

01:06:43.280 --> 01:06:45.560
And down again.

01:06:53.520 --> 01:06:54.679
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:56.999
people tell you not
to milk a good speech.

01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.400
Get off early, leave 'em laughing.

01:07:00.920 --> 01:07:03.639
Wise advice I'll certainly
try to bear in mind.

01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:06.519
But for now... part two!

01:07:06.520 --> 01:07:09.039
Part two is more action-based.

01:07:09.040 --> 01:07:12.759
I'm going to walk around,
shake things up a bit.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.559
Who'd go to a wedding?
That's the question.

01:07:15.560 --> 01:07:18.199
Who would bother
to go to any lengths

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.240
to get theMs..elves to a wedding?

01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:23.119
Well, everyone.

01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:25.679
Weddings are great, love a wedding.
What's he doing?

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:27.439
Something's wrong.

01:07:27.440 --> 01:07:28.959
And John's great too.

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.599
Haven't said that enough,
barely scratched the surface.

01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.959
I could go on all night

01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:37.279
about the depth and complexity
of his jumpers,

01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:39.599
and he can cook.

01:07:39.600 --> 01:07:43.160
Does... erm... a thing.
A thing with peas...

01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.639
Once. Might not be peas,
might not be him.

01:07:46.640 --> 01:07:49.639
But he's got a great singing voice,
or somebody does.

01:07:49.640 --> 01:07:51.920
Too many, too many,
too many, too many!

01:07:53.280 --> 01:07:56.039
Sorry, too many jokes about John.

01:07:56.040 --> 01:07:59.039
Now... Criminal intent.

01:07:59.040 --> 01:08:00.719
Where was I? Ah, yes.

01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:02.559
Extraordinary lengths.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:04.279
Speech. Speech.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.999
Let's talk about...

01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.480
All of which is suggestive of...

01:08:09.720 --> 01:08:12.559
Murder! Sorry, did I say murder?

01:08:12.560 --> 01:08:13.839
I meant to say marriage.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:16.439
But, you know,
they're quite similar procedures,

01:08:16.439 --> 01:08:17.679
when you think about it.

01:08:17.680 --> 01:08:19.519
The participants tend
to know each other

01:08:19.520 --> 01:08:21.279
and it's over
when one of them's dead.

01:08:21.279 --> 01:08:24.759
In fairness, murder is a lot quicker
though. Janine, what about this one?

01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:26.495
Acceptably hot? More
importantly, his

01:08:26.506 --> 01:08:28.759
girlfriend's wearing new
uncomfortable underwear

01:08:28.760 --> 01:08:30.745
and hasn't bothered to
pick this thread off his

01:08:30.756 --> 01:08:32.919
jacket, or point out the
grease smudge on his neck.

01:08:32.920 --> 01:08:35.559
He's going home alone.
Also he's a comics and sci-fi geek,

01:08:35.560 --> 01:08:38.519
they're always tremendously
grateful, really put the hours in.

01:08:38.520 --> 01:08:40.158
Jeff, the gents.

01:08:40.160 --> 01:08:41.439
Loos now, please.

01:08:41.439 --> 01:08:44.399
Greg. The loos, please. Why?

01:08:44.399 --> 01:08:46.640
Oh, I don't know,
maybe it's your TURN.

01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:49.639
Yeah, actually,
now you mention it.

01:08:49.640 --> 01:08:52.439
Sherlock, any chance of a...
An end date for this speech?

01:08:52.439 --> 01:08:53.519
Got to cut the cake.

01:08:53.520 --> 01:08:55.559
Oh, ladies and gentlemen,

01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:58.319
can't stand it when I finally
get the chance to speak for once.

01:08:58.319 --> 01:08:59.639
Vatican cameos.

01:08:59.640 --> 01:09:01.559
What did he say?
What does that mean?

01:09:01.560 --> 01:09:03.519
Battle stations,
someone's going to die.

01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:04.800
What?!

01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:08.560
Narrow it down. Narrow it down.

01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:11.639
Narrow it down!

01:09:11.640 --> 01:09:13.399
Argh! No, no!

01:09:13.399 --> 01:09:15.840
Not you!

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:20.439
You. It's always you.

01:09:20.439 --> 01:09:23.200
John Watson, you keep me right.

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:26.118
What do I do?

01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.759
You've already done it.

01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.879
Don't solve the murder.

01:09:29.880 --> 01:09:31.078
Save the life.

01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:33.559
Sorry, off piste a bit.

01:09:33.560 --> 01:09:34.879
Back now. Phew!

01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:37.800
Let's play a game.
Let's play murder.

01:09:39.200 --> 01:09:40.319
Sherlock!

01:09:40.319 --> 01:09:43.198
Imagine someone's going to
get murdered at a wedding.

01:09:43.200 --> 01:09:44.559
Who exactly would you pick?

01:09:44.560 --> 01:09:47.559
I think you're a popular choice
at the moment, dear.

01:09:47.560 --> 01:09:50.559
If someone could move Mr..s Hudson's
glass just slightly out of reach,

01:09:50.560 --> 01:09:51.560
that would be lovely.

01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:55.840
More importantly, who could you
only kill at a wedding?

01:09:57.200 --> 01:09:58.919
Most people you can kill
any old place.

01:09:58.920 --> 01:09:59.999
As a mental exercise,

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.399
I've often planned the murder
of friends and colleagues.

01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:03.519
Now, John, I'd poison.

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:06.599
Sloppy eater, dead easy. I've given
him chemicals and compounds,

01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.079
that way he's never even noticed.

01:10:08.080 --> 01:10:10.319
He missed a whole Wednesday once,
didn't have a clue.

01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:13.879
Lestrade's so easy to kill it's a miracle
no-one's succumbed to the temptation.

01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.745
I've got keys to my
brother's house, I could

01:10:15.757 --> 01:10:17.759
break in and asphyxiate
him, if the whim arose.

01:10:17.760 --> 01:10:19.559
He's pissed, isn't he? Ow!

01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:21.119
So, once again,

01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:23.679
who could you only kill here?

01:10:23.680 --> 01:10:25.239
Clearly it's a rare opportunity,

01:10:25.240 --> 01:10:27.199
so it's someone
who doesn't get out much.

01:10:27.200 --> 01:10:29.119
Someone for whom
a planned social encounter

01:10:29.120 --> 01:10:31.359
known about months in advance
is an exception.

01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:33.000
Has to be a unique opportunity.

01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.679
And since killing someone
in public is difficult,

01:10:36.680 --> 01:10:38.839
killing them in private
isn't an option.

01:10:38.840 --> 01:10:42.239
Someone who lives in an inaccessible
or unknown location, then.

01:10:42.240 --> 01:10:43.959
Someone private perhaps,

01:10:43.960 --> 01:10:46.000
obsessed with personal security.

01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:49.320
Possibly someone under threat.

01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:56.479
Major James Sholto, who he?
I don't think he's coming.

01:10:56.480 --> 01:10:57.480
He'll be there.

01:10:57.481 --> 01:10:59.359
Where are you living these days?

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:01.439
Oh, way out in
the middle of nowhere.

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.039
The press and families
gave him hell.

01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.880
He gets more death threats than you.

01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.319
A recluse?

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.359
Small household staff.

01:11:10.360 --> 01:11:12.439
Job? Gardener. Cook.
Private nurse. Maid.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.439
High turnover
for additional security.

01:11:14.440 --> 01:11:17.479
I do security work. Probably all
signed confidentiality agreements.

01:11:17.480 --> 01:11:19.298
Do you have a secret
you've never told anyone?

01:11:19.310 --> 01:11:19.920
No.

01:11:19.921 --> 01:11:22.519
There is another question that
remains. Rather a big one,

01:11:22.520 --> 01:11:25.199
a huge one - how would you do it?
How do you kill someone in public?

01:11:25.200 --> 01:11:26.999
There has to be a way.
This has been planned.

01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:29.039
Mr.. Holmes! Hello, Archie,
what's your theory?

01:11:29.040 --> 01:11:31.479
Get this right and there's
a headless nun in it for you.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.199
The invisible man could do it.
The who, what, why, when, where?

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:38.640
The invisible man with the invisible knife.
The one who tried to kill the Guardsman.

01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:55.839
Bainbridge?

01:11:55.840 --> 01:11:57.560
Bainbridge!

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:08.599
(Oh, not just planned -
planned and rehearsed.)

01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:12.359
Ladies and gentlemen,
there will now be a short interlude.

01:12:12.360 --> 01:12:14.440
The bride and groom...

01:12:17.160 --> 01:12:19.119
The bride and groom.

01:12:19.120 --> 01:12:20.947
Major Sholto's going to
be murdered, I don't

01:12:20.959 --> 01:12:22.879
know how or by whom, but
it's going to happen.

01:12:22.880 --> 01:12:25.439
Excuse me, coming through.
Consulting.

01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:29.959
Stay here. Please be careful.
Excuse me. Coming through.

01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:32.439
Excuse me.

01:12:32.440 --> 01:12:34.639
I'm sorry, one more.
Oops. I'm so sorry.

01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:35.640
Thank you.

01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:04.159
How can you not remember which room?
You remember everything.

01:13:04.160 --> 01:13:06.560
I have to delete something! 207.

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:16.520
Major Sholto? Major Sholto!

01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:21.919
Major Sholto! If someone's about
to make an attempt on my life,

01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:24.359
it won't be the first time.
I'm ready.

01:13:24.360 --> 01:13:26.359
Major, let us in.
Kick the door down.

01:13:26.360 --> 01:13:27.559
I really wouldn't.

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:32.119
I have a gun in my hand and
a lifetime of unfortunate reflexes.

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.730
You're not safe in there.
Whoever's after

01:13:33.742 --> 01:13:35.479
you, we know a locked
room doesn't stop him.

01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:37.439
The invisible man
with the invisible knife.

01:13:37.440 --> 01:13:39.428
I don't know how he does it.
I can't stop him and

01:13:39.440 --> 01:13:41.279
that means he'll do it again!
Solve it, then!

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:43.119
I'm sorry?

01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:46.239
You're the famous Mr.. Holmes,
solve the case, on you go.

01:13:46.240 --> 01:13:48.879
Tell me how he did it
and I'll open the door.

01:13:48.880 --> 01:13:51.159
Please, this is no time for games,

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:52.639
just let us in, you're in danger!

01:13:52.640 --> 01:13:54.199
So are you,
so long as you're here.

01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:57.119
Please, leave me.

01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:00.639
Despite my reputation, I really
don't approve of collateral damage.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:03.839
Solve it. Sorry? Solve it and
he'll open the door, like he said.

01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:07.079
I couldn't solve it before, how can I
solve it now? Because it matters now.

01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:10.119
What are you talking about? Get your
wife under control! She's right.

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:11.999
Oh, you've changed!
No, she is. Shut up!

01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.279
You are not a puzzle-solver,
you never have been.

01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:15.399
You're a drama queen!

01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:19.160
Now, there's a man in there about
to die, the game is on - solve it!

01:14:34.920 --> 01:14:36.000
Bainbridge?

01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.200
Bainbridge!

01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:45.679
Though in fairness,
he's a drama queen too. I know.

01:14:45.680 --> 01:14:47.759
Major Sholto, no-one's
coming to kill you.

01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.559
I'm afraid you've already
been killed several hours ago.

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:51.719
What did you say?

01:14:51.720 --> 01:14:53.279
Don't take off your belt.

01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:54.799
My belt?

01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:55.919
His belt, yes.

01:14:55.920 --> 01:14:58.319
Bainbridge was stabbed
hours before we even saw him,

01:14:58.320 --> 01:14:59.879
but it was through his belt.

01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:01.719
Tight belt, worn high on the waist.

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:03.719
Very easy to push a small blade
through the fabric

01:15:03.720 --> 01:15:04.959
and you wouldn't even feel it.

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.839
The belt would bind the flesh
together when it was tied tight.

01:15:07.840 --> 01:15:10.439
Exactly. But when you took it off...
Delayed-action stabbing.

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:13.319
All the time in the world
to create an alibi. Major Sholto?

01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:14.600
So...

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:20.679
I was to be killed by my uniform.

01:15:20.680 --> 01:15:23.000
How appropriate.

01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.559
He solved the case, Major,

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:29.559
you're supposed to open
the door now. A deal is a deal.

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:31.599
I'm not even supposed to
have this any more,

01:15:31.600 --> 01:15:33.719
they gave me special
dispensation to keep it.

01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:36.039
I couldn't imagine life
out of this uniform.

01:15:36.040 --> 01:15:39.080
I suppose, given the circuMs..tances,
I don't have to.

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:43.439
When so many want you dead,

01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:45.400
it hardly seeMs..
Good manners to argue.

01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:53.839
Whatever you're doing in there,
James, stop it, right now!

01:15:53.840 --> 01:15:55.559
I will kick this door down!

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:58.479
Mr.. Holmes, you and
I are similar, I think.

01:15:58.480 --> 01:16:01.279
Yes, I think we are. There's
a proper time to die, isn't there?

01:16:01.280 --> 01:16:02.599
Of course there is.

01:16:02.600 --> 01:16:06.319
And one should embrace it
when it comes.

01:16:06.320 --> 01:16:07.359
Like a soldier.

01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:10.160
Of course one should,
but not at John's wedding!

01:16:12.320 --> 01:16:16.359
We wouldn't do that,
would we, you and me?

01:16:16.360 --> 01:16:19.120
We would never do that
to John Watson.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:25.599
I'm going to break it down.

01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.640
Wait, wait, wait, you won't have to.

01:16:33.920 --> 01:16:36.559
I believe I am in need
of medical attention.

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:39.360
I believe I'm your doctor.

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.199
Pretty good.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.279
Just hold your nerve
on your turning.

01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.959
Why do we have to rehearse?

01:17:00.960 --> 01:17:03.199
Because we are about to
dance together in public

01:17:03.200 --> 01:17:04.720
and your skills are appalling.

01:17:06.320 --> 01:17:08.319
Wow, you're a good teacher. Hmm.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:10.159
And you're a brilliant dancer.

01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:12.039
Can I let you in
on something, Janine?

01:17:12.040 --> 01:17:13.519
Go on, then.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:15.599
I love dancing,
I've always loved it.

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:16.679
Seriously?

01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:17.680
Watch out.

01:17:21.680 --> 01:17:24.199
Oh!

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.559
Never really comes up
in crime work, but, you know,

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:29.439
I live in hope of the right case.
Oh, I wish you weren't...

01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:32.599
whatever it is you are.

01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.439
I know. Well, glad to see
you've pulled, Sherlock,

01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:38.279
what with murderers
running riot at my wedding.

01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:39.959
One murderer... One nearly murderer.

01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:42.359
Loves to exaggerate -
you should try living with him.

01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:43.879
Sherlock.

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.639
Got him for you.

01:17:45.640 --> 01:17:48.759
Ah, the photographer,
excellent. Thank you.

01:17:48.760 --> 01:17:51.119
May I have a look at your camera?

01:17:51.120 --> 01:17:54.119
Erm, what's this about?
I was halfway home.

01:17:54.120 --> 01:17:56.200
You should have driven faster.

01:17:57.400 --> 01:17:58.959
Ah, yes. Yes!

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:00.719
Very good.

01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:03.319
Now you see... Perfect.

01:18:03.320 --> 01:18:05.719
What is? Are you going to tell us?

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:07.280
Try looking yourself.

01:18:08.960 --> 01:18:12.239
Look for what?
Is the murderer in these photographs?

01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:14.039
It's not what's
in the photographs,

01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:16.119
it's what's not in them.
Not in any of them.

01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:17.399
Sherlock?

01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:19.760
The showing-off thing,
we've discussed it before...

01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:24.999
There is always a man at a wedding
who is not in any photograph,

01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:26.799
who can go anywhere.

01:18:26.800 --> 01:18:29.599
And even carry an equipment bag
around with him if he likes.

01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:31.559
And you never even see his face.

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:33.160
You only ever see...

01:18:41.960 --> 01:18:43.239
The camera.

01:18:43.240 --> 01:18:44.759
What are you doing? What is this?

01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:47.399
Jonathan Small, today's
substitute wedding photographer,

01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:49.279
known to us as the Mayfly Man.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:53.999
His brother was one of the raw
recruits killed in that incursion.

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:56.079
Johnny sought revenge on Sholto,

01:18:56.080 --> 01:18:58.399
worked his way through
Sholto's staff,

01:18:58.400 --> 01:18:59.599
found what he needed.

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:01.799
An invitation to a wedding.

01:19:01.800 --> 01:19:05.319
The one time Sholto would
have to be out in public.

01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.119
So he made his plan
and rehearsed the murder,

01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.640
making sure of every last detail.

01:19:24.840 --> 01:19:26.399
Brilliant, ruthless,

01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:28.319
and almost certainly a monomaniac.

01:19:28.320 --> 01:19:31.319
Though, in fairness, his photographs
are actually quite good.

01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:32.919
Everything you need is on that.

01:19:32.920 --> 01:19:35.959
You probably ought to
arrest him or something.

01:19:35.960 --> 01:19:38.079
Do you always carry handcuffs?

01:19:38.080 --> 01:19:40.119
Down, girl. Come on, quick.

01:19:40.120 --> 01:19:42.599
It's not me you should
be arresting, Mr.. Holmes.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:45.159
Oh, I don't do the arresting,
I just farm that out.

01:19:45.160 --> 01:19:47.359
Sholto, he's the killer, not me.

01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:49.600
I should have killed him quicker.

01:19:52.200 --> 01:19:54.120
I shouldn't have tried to be clever.

01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:57.280
You should have driven faster.

01:20:06.600 --> 01:20:07.920
Right.

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.519
Ladies and gentlemen,
just one last thing

01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:30.559
before the evening begins properly.

01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.319
Apologies for earlier,
a crisis arose and was dealt with.

01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.319
More importantly, however,

01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.199
today we saw two people make vows.

01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.639
I've never made a vow in my life

01:21:39.640 --> 01:21:41.399
and after tonight
I never will again.

01:21:41.400 --> 01:21:43.599
So, here in front of you all,

01:21:43.600 --> 01:21:45.320
my first and last vow.

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:50.319
Mary and John,
whatever it takes,

01:21:50.320 --> 01:21:53.679
whatever happens, from now on,

01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:56.199
I swear I will always be there.

01:21:56.200 --> 01:21:57.559
Always.

01:21:57.560 --> 01:21:58.959
For all three of you.

01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.439
Erm... Sorry, I mean...
I mean two of you.

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:03.959
All two of you. Both of you,
in fact. I just miscounted.

01:22:03.960 --> 01:22:05.839
Anyway, it's time for dancing.

01:22:05.840 --> 01:22:07.679
Play the music again,
please. Thank you.

01:22:07.680 --> 01:22:09.719
OK, everybody, just dance,
don't be shy.

01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:11.799
Dancing, please. Very good.

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:14.559
Sorry, that was one more deduction
than I was really expecting.

01:22:14.560 --> 01:22:16.279
Deduction? Increased appetite...

01:22:16.280 --> 01:22:18.239
I'm starving.
Change of taste perception.

01:22:18.240 --> 01:22:20.399
Oh, I chose this wine,
but it's bloody awful!

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:21.679
You were sick this morning.

01:22:21.680 --> 01:22:23.359
You assumed it was
just wedding nerves.

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.519
You got angry with me
when I mentioned it to you.

01:22:25.520 --> 01:22:28.719
All the signs are there. The signs?

01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:30.679
The signs of three.

01:22:30.680 --> 01:22:32.559
What?

01:22:32.560 --> 01:22:34.480
Mary, I think you should
do a pregnancy test.

01:22:35.560 --> 01:22:38.679
Well, the statistics for
the first trimester are...

01:22:38.680 --> 01:22:39.720
Shut up!

01:22:41.200 --> 01:22:42.479
Just shut up.

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.679
Sorry.

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.839
How did he notice before me?

01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:48.319
I'm a bloody doctor. It's your
day off. It's YOUR day off!

01:22:48.320 --> 01:22:49.439
Stop. Stop panicking.

01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:52.239
I'm not panicking. I'm pregnant,
I'm panicking! Don't panic.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:53.879
None of you panic.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:55.639
Absolutely no reason to panic.

01:22:55.640 --> 01:22:57.586
Oh, and you'd know, of course!
Yes, I would.

01:22:57.598 --> 01:22:59.599
You're already the best
parents in the world,

01:22:59.600 --> 01:23:02.119
look at all the practice
you've had. What practice?

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:06.040
Well, you're hardly going to need me around
now that you've got a real baby on the way.

01:23:13.680 --> 01:23:15.720
Are you all right? Yeah!

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:25.599
Dance. Hmm?
Both of you now, go, dance.

01:23:25.600 --> 01:23:28.879
We can't just stand here, people will
wonder what we're talking about. Right.

01:23:28.880 --> 01:23:30.119
Well, what about you?

01:23:30.120 --> 01:23:33.559
Yeah, we can't all three dance, there
are limits. Yes, there are. Ahem.

01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.439
Come on, husband, let's go.

01:23:35.440 --> 01:23:37.479
This isn't a waltz, is it? No.

01:23:37.480 --> 01:23:39.199
Don't worry,
I have been tutoring him.

01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:41.180
He did, you know. Baker
Street, behind closed

01:23:41.192 --> 01:23:42.879
curtains. Mr..s Hudson
came in one time.

01:23:42.880 --> 01:23:45.040
I don't know how those
rumours started!

01:23:49.280 --> 01:23:51.240
* Spinnin' my head around
and taking my body under

01:23:53.320 --> 01:23:55.360
* Oh, what a night!

01:23:57.640 --> 01:24:01.440
* Oh, what a night!

01:24:11.040 --> 01:24:14.479
* Oh, I

01:24:14.480 --> 01:24:18.239
* I got a funny feelin'
when she walked

01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:22.679
* In the room * Hey, I

01:24:22.680 --> 01:24:27.400
* As I recall it ended much too soon

01:24:29.920 --> 01:24:32.719
* Oh, what a night

01:24:32.720 --> 01:24:36.479
* Why'd it take so long
to see the light?

01:24:36.480 --> 01:24:41.439
* Seemed so wrong
but now it seeMs.. so right

01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:45.520
* What a lady, what a night

01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:02.959
* Oh, I felt a rush like
a rolling ball of thunder

01:25:02.960 --> 01:25:06.639
* Spinnin' my head around
and taking my body under

01:25:06.640 --> 01:25:09.600
* Oh, what a night!

01:25:11.120 --> 01:25:14.640
* Oh, what a night!

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:17.520
* Oh, what a night... *

01:25:18.305 --> 01:25:24.275
