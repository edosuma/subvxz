WEBVTT

00:06.677 --> 00:08.509
( cheering )

00:08.509 --> 00:10.081
GREAT WORK.

00:10.081 --> 00:11.412
FLAWLESS EXECUTION.

00:11.412 --> 00:14.585
NOW THAT IS HOW YOU
LEAD A MISSION.

00:14.585 --> 00:16.087
WHY, THANK YOU.

00:16.087 --> 00:17.648
I WAS TALKING ABOUT ME.

00:18.649 --> 00:20.321
BUT EVERY OLYMPIC PODIUM

00:20.321 --> 00:22.623
NEEDS A BRONZE AND A SILVER.

00:22.623 --> 00:25.096
WHOO-HOO! I MEDALED!

00:25.096 --> 00:26.427
WHOA!

00:29.530 --> 00:31.532
UGH.
 DON'T LOOK AT US.

00:31.532 --> 00:35.666
YOU'RE THE ONE
THAT GAVE SUPER STRENGTH
TO A BOX OF ROCKS.

00:35.666 --> 00:38.809
HEY, GUYS.

00:38.809 --> 00:41.072
HOW'D THE MISSION GO?

00:41.072 --> 00:45.646
GREAT. WE FIXED THE PENTAGON'S
COMMUNICATION SATELLITE
AND RETURNED IT TO ORBIT.

00:45.646 --> 00:49.480
I EVEN RIGGED IT SO WE GET
EVERY TV CHANNEL IN THE WORLD!

00:49.480 --> 00:54.225
WHO WANTS TO WATCH
GUATEMALAN DRAG RACING?!

00:54.225 --> 00:56.627
DID MY SUGGESTIONS
COME IN HANDY ON THE MISSION?

00:56.627 --> 00:58.659
WHAT SUGGESTIONS?

00:58.659 --> 01:02.733
I DID A TON
OF STRATEGIC RESEARCH
AND GAVE IT TO BID D.

01:02.733 --> 01:06.066
OH, RIGHT. I'M SORRY, LEO,
I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO USE IT.

01:06.066 --> 01:10.501
YES, YOU DID.
YOU SPILLED YOUR COFFEE AND USED
LEO'S RESEARCH TO MOP IT UP.

01:12.673 --> 01:16.307
YOU USED MY SUGGESTIONS
AS A SPONGE?

01:16.307 --> 01:19.150
MORE LIKE A PAPER TOWEL.

01:19.150 --> 01:22.613
BUT IT WAS VERY ABSORBENT.

01:22.613 --> 01:25.316
WHY DON'T YOU GUYS GO
CLEAR OUT THE REST OF YOUR GEAR.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.659
WE NEED TO TALK.

01:28.659 --> 01:31.762
I'M DONE BEING THE WATER BOY.
I WANNA BE A PART OF THE TEAM.

01:31.762 --> 01:35.526
LEO, I TOLD YOU,
YOU CAN'T BE PART OF THE TEAM.
YOU'RE NOT BIONIC.

01:35.526 --> 01:38.669
AND BESIDES, STATISTICS SHOW
THAT MOST ACCIDENTS HAPPEN

01:38.669 --> 01:41.172
WITHIN A THREE-MILE RADIUS
OF YOU.

01:43.674 --> 01:47.208
BUT I'VE GROWN. I'VE MATURED.

01:47.208 --> 01:49.740
I WEAR MEDIUM NOW.

01:49.740 --> 01:51.182
( beeping )

01:51.182 --> 01:53.684
LOOK, I KNOW
I CAN'T GO ON MISSIONS,

01:53.684 --> 01:55.186
BUT I CAN HELP YOU
IN OTHER WAYS.

01:55.186 --> 01:56.617
YOU KEEP IGNORING ME!

01:56.617 --> 01:58.419
HMM?

01:59.490 --> 02:00.791
I'M SORRY. YOU KNOW WHAT?

02:00.791 --> 02:03.324
MAYBE THERE IS A WAY
YOU CAN HELP OUT AROUND HERE.

02:03.324 --> 02:04.695
FINALLY. THANK YOU.

02:04.695 --> 02:06.627
HERE.

02:06.627 --> 02:10.631
YOU CAN TYPE UP
THE MISSION SUMMARY REPORTS.

02:10.631 --> 02:12.733
YOU WANT ME TO BE
YOUR SECRETARY?

02:12.733 --> 02:16.267
NO. SECRETARIES GET PAID.

02:16.267 --> 02:18.809
YOU'D BE DOING THIS FOR FREE.

02:22.813 --> 02:25.776
Narrator:
 THE WORLD'S FIRST
BIONIC SUPERHUMANS.

02:25.776 --> 02:27.748
THEY'RE STRONGER THAN US,

02:27.748 --> 02:29.450
FASTER, SMARTER--

02:29.450 --> 02:31.782
THE NEXT GENERATION
OF THE HUMAN RACE IS...

02:31.782 --> 02:34.825
LIVING IN MY BASEMENT?

02:34.825 --> 02:37.788
♪♪

03:12.293 --> 03:13.864
( all laughing )

03:13.864 --> 03:15.926
NOT SO FAST!

03:15.926 --> 03:17.268
( all groan )

03:19.400 --> 03:20.971
YOU THREE
MISSED SCHOOL YESTERDAY...

03:20.971 --> 03:24.575
NOT THAT I DIDN'T ENJOY IT.

03:24.575 --> 03:26.577
BUT IT'S BEEN HAPPENING
WAY TOO MUCH LATELY.

03:26.577 --> 03:28.439
LOOK AT THIS ATTENDANCE REPORT.

03:28.439 --> 03:30.210
YOU STILL KEEP PAPER RECORDS?

03:30.210 --> 03:32.343
YOU KNOW,
WE HAVE COMPUTERS NOW...

03:32.343 --> 03:35.686
ALSO INDOOR PLUMBING
AND FIRE.

03:35.686 --> 03:37.988
DO YOU REALLY
WANNA POKE THE BEAR?

03:37.988 --> 03:40.991
DO YOU REALLY
WANNA USE THAT ANALOGY?

03:40.991 --> 03:42.823
SHUT IT, DOOLEY!

03:42.823 --> 03:45.826
I'VE BEEN WORKING OUT.
DON'T MAKE ME FLEX MY GUNS.

03:47.498 --> 03:49.800
YOU THREE ARE IN BIG TROUBLE.

03:49.800 --> 03:51.001
OH, ACTUALLY WE'RE NOT,

03:51.001 --> 03:53.504
'CAUSE WE HAVE
A NOTE FROM OUR DAD.

03:53.504 --> 03:54.935
HE SIGNED IT AND EVERYTHING.

03:54.935 --> 03:58.008
WITH HIS NAME.

03:58.008 --> 04:02.373
OH, WELL, I'M SORRY. MY BAD.

04:02.373 --> 04:06.347
THAT CHANGES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING!

04:09.350 --> 04:13.384
JUST BECAUSE YOUR DAD
LETS YOU CUT SCHOOL
DOESN'T MEAN I HAVE TO.

04:13.384 --> 04:15.326
SOMEBODY HAS TO BE
THE DISCIPLINARIAN.

04:15.326 --> 04:17.428
IT'S LIKE I TELL MY CATS...

04:17.428 --> 04:19.360
( hisses )

04:21.291 --> 04:23.634
SEE YOU THREE IN DETENTION!

04:26.297 --> 04:29.300
GREAT. WE MISS SCHOOL
FOR A MISSION AND GET PUNISHED.

04:29.300 --> 04:31.001
THIS ISN'T FAIR.

04:31.001 --> 04:33.674
NO, IT REALLY ISN'T.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.476
WELL, YOU GUYS HAVE FUN.

04:40.311 --> 04:41.382
( beeping )

04:41.382 --> 04:42.983
SUMMARY REPORTS ARE DONE.

04:42.983 --> 04:46.387
AND MAY I JUST SAY,
I'VE NEVER FELT SO ALIVE.

04:46.387 --> 04:48.058
( beeping )

04:48.058 --> 04:49.960
SO WHAT ARE YOU WORKING ON?

04:49.960 --> 04:51.291
HI!

04:51.291 --> 04:52.292
( screams )

04:52.292 --> 04:55.366
HA! NOW NONE OF YOU ARE SAFE!

04:55.366 --> 04:58.599
I DESIGNED A ROBOT BODY
FOR EDDY. ISN'T IT COOL?

04:58.599 --> 05:01.402
HE CAN NOW PATROL THE GROUNDS,
HE CAN DISABLE EXPLOSIVES,

05:01.402 --> 05:05.606
AND HE CAN MIX TWO PAINT CANS
AT THE SAME TIME.

05:05.606 --> 05:07.478
LOOK WHAT ELSE I CAN DO!

05:07.478 --> 05:10.310
( gasping )

05:10.310 --> 05:13.313
ISN'T THAT GREAT?
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:13.313 --> 05:16.447
WELL, AT LEAST
I'M NOT THE SHORTEST PERSON
IN THE ROOM ANYMORE.

05:19.490 --> 05:21.422
NOW WHAT DO YOU THINK?

05:21.422 --> 05:24.495
I THINK I'M GONNA START
LOCKING MY DOOR AT NIGHT.

05:28.098 --> 05:30.661
YOU BETTER HOPE THAT WAS WATER!

05:32.062 --> 05:34.535
IT'S MOSTLY WATER.

05:37.638 --> 05:39.440
WELCOME TO DINGO DETENTION...

05:39.440 --> 05:44.114
OR AS I LIKE TO CALL IT,
ME TIME! ( chuckles )

05:44.114 --> 05:46.076
I USED TO BE
A MAXIMUM SECURITY PRISON GUARD,

05:46.076 --> 05:50.421
AND I STILL HAVE THE SCARS FROM
THE ELECTRIC CHAIR TO PROVE IT.

05:50.421 --> 05:52.423
IT WAS THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT
AND I THOUGHT IT WAS THE CAN.

05:52.423 --> 05:54.985
IT HAPPENS.

05:54.985 --> 05:58.489
YOU WANNA SEE?
 All: NO!

05:58.489 --> 06:00.631
BOTTOM LINE, THERE'S NO ESCAPE.

06:00.631 --> 06:02.032
ALL THE EXITS ARE COVERED.

06:04.094 --> 06:06.667
IN DINGO DETENTION,
WE HAVE TWO SIMPLE RULES:

06:06.667 --> 06:07.768
NO TALKING...

06:07.768 --> 06:10.040
( beeping )
 AND NO CELL PHONES!

06:10.040 --> 06:12.403
AND APPARENTLY NO MOUTHWASH.

06:12.403 --> 06:13.744
( coughs )

06:13.744 --> 06:16.507
JOKES ON YOU,
I GARGLE WITH VINEGAR.

06:18.609 --> 06:21.952
WE WILL BE ON TOTAL LOCKDOWN
FOR THE NEXT THREE HOURS.

06:21.952 --> 06:23.454
AND THAT BEGINS...

06:23.454 --> 06:25.456
NOW! ( chuckles )

06:25.456 --> 06:28.719
( alarm sounds )

06:32.122 --> 06:35.826
GUYS, I JUST GOT
AN URGENT MISSION ALERT
FROM MR. DAVENPORT.

06:35.826 --> 06:36.997
OH, NO.
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?

06:36.997 --> 06:39.500
GUYS, PERRY SAID NO TALKING!

06:39.500 --> 06:42.903
EXCUSE ME, WE'VE GOT
A COUPLE TALKERS OVER HERE.

06:42.903 --> 06:46.477
YOU TWO ARE BUSTED!
GIVE ME THAT CELL PHONE!

06:46.477 --> 06:48.479
YUCK.

06:48.479 --> 06:50.481
ANY OF YOU OTHER
LITTLE THUGS HOLDING?

06:50.481 --> 06:54.485
FLO, BRANDY, WE NEED
A PAT DOWN OVER HERE.

06:54.485 --> 06:57.588
GO AHEAD, GIRLS,
FLIP 'EM AND RIP 'EM!

07:06.096 --> 07:07.758
WILL YOU STOP THAT!

07:07.758 --> 07:11.902
WHAT DO YOU THINK, I'M TRYING
TO CRASH INTO YOUR BUTT?

07:11.902 --> 07:13.964
LEO, WHERE IS EVERYBODY?

07:13.964 --> 07:16.607
I SENT OUT A MISSION ALERT
AND NO ONE IS RESPONDING.

07:16.607 --> 07:17.968
OH, THEY'RE STUCK IN DETENTION.

07:17.968 --> 07:21.572
THEY'RE PROBABLY GETTING
FLIPPED AND RIPPED AS WE SPEAK.

07:21.572 --> 07:24.444
THE FLIPPING'S NOT SO BAD,
IT'S THE RIPPING THAT HAUNTS YA.

07:24.444 --> 07:25.576
( laughs )

07:25.576 --> 07:29.049
THERE IS AN UNDERGROUND GAS LEAK

07:29.049 --> 07:31.051
AND THE HAZMAT TEAM
CANNOT CONTAIN IT.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.524
I NEED ADAM, BREE, AND CHASE
TO SHUT IT DOWN.

07:33.524 --> 07:35.626
LET ME HELP.

07:35.626 --> 07:37.628
( laughs )

07:37.628 --> 07:40.491
THAT'S VERY FUNNY,
BUT THIS IS SERIOUS.

07:40.491 --> 07:44.895
IF THAT SUBSTATION EXPLODES,
IT'LL SEND A HIGHLY TOXIC
GAS CLOUD INTO THE ATMOSPHERE.

07:44.895 --> 07:47.898
I GOTTA GET PRINCIPAL PERRY
TO LET THEM GO.

07:47.898 --> 07:50.200
TALK ABOUT
A HIGHLY TOXIC GAS CLOUD.

07:53.103 --> 07:56.106
( video game sounds )

07:56.106 --> 07:58.709
WHAT IS SHE DOING WITH MY PHONE?

07:58.709 --> 08:02.783
DIE, ANGRY PIGEON, DIE!

08:02.783 --> 08:07.718
( buzzing )

08:10.090 --> 08:12.593
THERE'S NO ANSWER.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THEM.

08:12.593 --> 08:16.066
LOOK, TAKE THIS NOTE
TO PRINCIPAL PERRY

08:16.066 --> 08:19.069
AND TELL HER TO LET
ADAM, BREE, AND CHASE LEAVE.

08:19.069 --> 08:22.072
EDDY AND I WILL HEAD
TO THE SUBSTATION AND START
TAKING GAS LEVEL READINGS.

08:22.072 --> 08:25.806
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.
YOU'RE TAKING HIM
ON A MISSION AND NOT ME?

08:25.806 --> 08:27.738
OH, IT'S NOTHING PERSONAL.

08:27.738 --> 08:29.640
HE JUST THINKS
YOU'RE WORTHLESS.

08:30.681 --> 08:31.812
COME ON!

08:34.514 --> 08:35.986
WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE.

08:35.986 --> 08:37.287
GUYS, DON'T WORRY.

08:37.287 --> 08:39.620
I'LL JUST USE MY SUPER STRENGTH
TO BUST DOWN THE WALL.

08:39.620 --> 08:42.893
ADAM, THEN EVERYONE
WOULD SEE YOUR BIONICS.

08:42.893 --> 08:46.727
OH, YEAH.

08:48.559 --> 08:50.731
OH, GOODY.

08:51.862 --> 08:54.104
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

08:54.104 --> 08:57.037
THERE'S AN EMERGENCY
AND MY STEPDAD ASKED ME
TO GIVE YOU THIS.

08:57.037 --> 09:00.140
OOH, YUM! SECOND LUNCH!

09:00.140 --> 09:03.143
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!
THIS IS SERIOUS!

09:03.143 --> 09:04.815
IT'S A MATTER
OF LIFE AND DEATH!

09:04.815 --> 09:08.318
YOU SAID THAT SAME THING
WHEN THE VENDING MACHINE
RAN OUT OF CHEESE CURLS.

09:08.318 --> 09:11.622
BUT THIS IS DIFFERENT!
PLEASE! YOU GOTTA LET THEM GO!

09:12.753 --> 09:14.925
NO! ( chuckles )

09:14.925 --> 09:19.660
ALTHOUGH, THERE MIGHT BE A WAY
THEY CAN EARN THEIR FREEDOM.

09:21.762 --> 09:24.695
...34, 35...

09:24.695 --> 09:26.867
All: ( chanting )
SPIN, SPIN, SPIN!

09:26.867 --> 09:29.239
...AND 40!

09:29.239 --> 09:31.602
OKAY, WHOEVER MAKES IT OUT
THE OPEN DOOR IS FREE TO LEAVE!

09:31.602 --> 09:33.003
GO!

09:33.003 --> 09:34.605
COME ON, GUYS!
COME ON, GUYS! COME ON!

09:40.681 --> 09:42.152
OH! OH!
 AH! YES!

09:43.714 --> 09:45.355
COME ON, BREE!
YOU CAN DO THIS!

09:45.355 --> 09:48.318
NO. NO, BREE,
THAT WAY! THAT WAY!

09:48.318 --> 09:51.021
NO, NO, NO!
NO, NO, NO!

09:51.021 --> 09:52.723
COME ON, CHASE!
 COME ON!

09:52.723 --> 09:55.325
FREEDOM IS SO CLOSE?,
CAN'T YOU JUST TASTE IT?!

09:55.325 --> 09:58.729
I'M ALMOST THERE!
I'M GONNA MAKE IT!

09:58.729 --> 10:00.370
( groans )

10:00.370 --> 10:03.333
( laughs ) FAIL!

10:03.333 --> 10:06.376
PREPARE TO BE ENTERTAINED,
AMOEBA BRAINS!

10:06.376 --> 10:08.639
TIME FOR MY NEXT CHALLENGE!

10:08.639 --> 10:10.881
THEY'RE GONNA BE HERE
A WHILE, AREN'T THEY?

10:10.881 --> 10:13.684
RING, RING.
EXCUSE ME A SECOND.

10:13.684 --> 10:17.788
HELLO? OH, DEPARTMENT
OF STUPID QUESTIONS?

10:17.788 --> 10:20.090
IT'S FOR YOU.

10:26.026 --> 10:28.058
WHY DON'T I GET A HAZMAT SUIT?

10:28.058 --> 10:30.100
BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED ONE.

10:30.100 --> 10:32.803
OOH! OOH! OOH!

10:32.803 --> 10:35.736
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
WHAT IF THIS GAS CORRODES
ALL MY SPECIAL PARTS?

10:35.736 --> 10:38.709
YOU ONLY HAVE ONE SPECIAL PART:
YOUR OFF SWITCH!

10:38.709 --> 10:41.672
OOH! OOH! OOH!

10:41.672 --> 10:43.243
EDDY, GIVE ME A READING
WITH YOUR GAS SENSOR!

10:43.243 --> 10:44.775
COMING RIGHT UP!

10:44.775 --> 10:49.379
( disco music playing )

10:49.379 --> 10:51.381
WHAT? I ADDED
A DISCO PARTY BALL.

10:51.381 --> 10:52.723
COMPOSED THE MUSIC MYSELF.

10:52.723 --> 10:55.155
IS IT TO PRODUCED?
TELL ME THE TRUTH.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.988
JUST TAKE THE READING!

10:57.988 --> 10:59.790
SOMEBODY'S COMING!

10:59.790 --> 11:02.292
FINALLY ADAM, BREE,
AND CHASE ARE HERE!

11:03.864 --> 11:05.696
LEO!

11:05.696 --> 11:06.897
THEY'RE STUCK IN DETENTION

11:06.897 --> 11:08.739
AND PRINCIPAL PERRY
WON'T LET THEM OUT,

11:08.739 --> 11:10.971
BUT I BROUGHT YOU
SOMETHING EVEN BETTER!

11:10.971 --> 11:12.172
ME!

11:13.774 --> 11:16.276
WHOO-HOO! LEO'S HERE!

11:16.276 --> 11:18.448
SAID NO ONE EVER.

11:26.386 --> 11:28.388
LEO, IT IS
TOO DANGEROUS IN HERE!

11:28.388 --> 11:30.821
THE GAS LEVELS ARE RISING!
YOU HAVE TO GET OUT!

11:30.821 --> 11:33.093
NO WAY!
I AM NOT LEAVING YOU BEHIND!

11:33.093 --> 11:34.725
GO!
 NO!

11:34.725 --> 11:36.967
LOOK OUT!
 ( screams )

11:43.403 --> 11:45.405
GREAT,
NOW THE ACCESS TUNNEL'S JAMMED!

11:45.405 --> 11:47.407
THE SPARK MUST HAVE CAUSED
THE SECONDARY LINE TO BLOW.

11:47.407 --> 11:50.140
IF THE PRIMARY LINE GOES,
WE'RE TOAST!

11:50.140 --> 11:53.914
WELL, THAT'S JUST GREAT!
THERE GOES MY 5K FUN RUN!

11:53.914 --> 11:56.817
SHUT... IT!

11:56.817 --> 12:00.821
HOT! THAT'S HOT!
AND MY GLOVE IS MELTING!

12:04.354 --> 12:07.197
OKAY, TIME FOR ROUND FOUR...

12:07.197 --> 12:09.329
HUNDRED! ( chuckles )

12:11.061 --> 12:12.963
( both groan )

12:14.935 --> 12:19.870
AND THE WINNER
OF THE VERY SCARY PERRY
KNOCKOUT CHALLENGE IS...

12:19.870 --> 12:21.071
ME!

12:22.472 --> 12:24.174
AH, THAT'S BETTER THAN WATCHING

12:24.174 --> 12:27.177
MY CATS FIGHT FOR
THE LAST SPOT ON THE BED.

12:27.177 --> 12:31.081
OH, THE PRETTY KITTIES
GET TO CUDDLE WITH MAMA.

12:31.081 --> 12:33.954
( bell rings )

12:33.954 --> 12:35.886
YOU THREE CAN GO.

12:35.886 --> 12:37.287
HERE'S YOUR JUNK.

12:39.359 --> 12:41.261
COME ON, GUYS. IF WE HURRY,
WE CAN STILL MAKE THE MISSION.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.863
BUT WE HAVE TO GO
GET OUR GEAR FIRST.

12:42.863 --> 12:46.036
HOLD ON. WHAT GEAR?
WHAT MISSION?

12:46.036 --> 12:48.368
IS THAT SOME SORT
OF CODE FOR VANDALISM?

12:48.368 --> 12:50.370
ARE YOU THREE
PULLING A SCHOOL PRANK?

12:50.370 --> 12:52.803
NO.
 NO.
 YES.

12:52.803 --> 12:54.304
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

12:54.304 --> 12:57.247
NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE MISSION.

12:57.247 --> 13:02.112
HE MUST'VE TAKEN A FEW TOO MANY
GIANT BOXING GLOVES TO THE HEAD.

13:02.112 --> 13:04.114
THERE'S NO PRANK.
WE'RE GONNA MOSEY.

13:04.114 --> 13:07.387
UH, THANK YOU
FOR A LOVELY DETENTION.

13:07.387 --> 13:10.961
AH, HOLD IT, LADY BLAH-BLAH.

13:12.322 --> 13:13.864
YOU THREE HAVE A SECRET,

13:13.864 --> 13:16.196
AND THERE'S NOTHING
I HATE MORE THAN SECRETS.

13:16.196 --> 13:19.199
WELL, EXCEPT FOR
OTHER PEOPLE'S BIRTHDAYS.

13:19.199 --> 13:22.002
"YOU'RE ALIVE, WE GET IT."

13:24.975 --> 13:30.180
NOW WE'RE GONNA PLAY
A LITTLE GAME I LIKE
TO CALL "INTERROGATION"!

13:30.180 --> 13:35.115
OH, I LOVE THAT GAME!
I CALL TOP HAT! NO, LITTLE DOG!
NO, TOP HAT! UGH!

13:35.115 --> 13:37.287
I CAN'T DECIDE.

13:43.493 --> 13:45.025
THE GAS LEVELS
ARE STILL BUILDING!

13:45.025 --> 13:46.857
OUR OXYGEN SUPPLY
IS ALMOST GONE!

13:46.857 --> 13:48.328
TIME IS RUNNING OUT!

13:48.328 --> 13:51.501
I'M SCARED! HOLD ME, DONNIE!

13:51.501 --> 13:53.503
STOP THAT!

13:53.503 --> 13:57.367
THIS STUFF IS USELESS!
SEE, THIS IS WHY
I NEED THEIR BIONICS.

13:57.367 --> 14:00.941
IF BREE WAS HERE,
SHE COULD USE HER SUPER SPEED
TO CREATE A VACUUM

14:00.941 --> 14:03.573
TO CONTAIN THE GAS
UNTIL I FIGURED OUT A WAY
TO SLOW DOWN THE LEAK.

14:06.216 --> 14:08.548
WAIT, WHAT IF WE SPEED IT UP?

14:08.548 --> 14:11.451
YOU DO REALIZE
THAT'S THE OPPOSITE
OF SLOWING IT DOWN, RIGHT?

14:11.451 --> 14:13.423
I MEAN THE FAN.

14:13.423 --> 14:15.956
WHEN ADAM HAS B.O.,
WE USE THE EXHAUST FAN

14:15.956 --> 14:18.588
IN HIS CAPSULE TO EMPTY
THE NASTINESS INTO BREE'S.

14:18.588 --> 14:21.861
IT'S DISGUSTING FOR HER
BUT HILARIOUS FOR US.

14:21.861 --> 14:25.565
SO YOU'RE SAYING
IF WE CAN START THE TURBINE...

14:25.565 --> 14:29.099
THEN WE CAN SUCK ALL THE GAS
OUT OF HERE AND SEAL IT
IN THE CONTAINMENT TUNNEL.

14:29.099 --> 14:31.101
LEO, THAT IS BRILLIANT!

14:31.101 --> 14:35.045
YEAH, WELL, JUST DON'T GO USING
IT TO WIPE UP YOUR SPILT COFFEE.

14:38.248 --> 14:40.450
THE ONLY THING IS,
IF THAT TURBINE SPARKS,

14:40.450 --> 14:42.112
IT COULD BLOW
THE WHOLE PLACE UP.

14:42.112 --> 14:45.315
YEAH, BUT IF WE
DON'T DO ANYTHING,
WE'LL DEFINITELY BLOW UP.

14:45.315 --> 14:48.458
TINY LOGIC STRIKES AGAIN!

14:48.458 --> 14:49.990
OKAY, FINGERS CROSSED.

14:49.990 --> 14:52.362
( explosion )

14:52.362 --> 14:54.464
( chuckles ) JUST KIDDING!

14:56.126 --> 14:57.467
COME ON.

14:57.467 --> 15:00.030
( whirring )

15:00.030 --> 15:02.432
Leo: IT'S WORKING!

15:02.432 --> 15:06.136
SEE, BIG D?
I TOLD YOU I COULD HELP.

15:06.136 --> 15:09.539
UH, GUYS,
SHOULD IT BE GOING THAT FAST?

15:12.542 --> 15:14.044
( screams )

15:14.044 --> 15:15.485
WAIT! NO, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO!

15:15.485 --> 15:19.349
CAN YOU STOP IT?!
CAN YOU STOP IT?!
CAN YOU STOP IT?!

15:19.349 --> 15:22.192
I'M TRYING TO CONCENTRATE!

15:22.192 --> 15:25.425
ARE YOU CONCENTRATING
ON TRYING TO STOP IT?

15:28.398 --> 15:33.533
WELL, SINCE ADAM
CLEARLY HAS NO CLUE
WHAT TO SAY UNDER PRESSURE,

15:33.533 --> 15:36.006
HERE'S HOW WE'LL
HANDLE THE INTERROGATION.

15:36.006 --> 15:37.507
WHENEVER YOU'RE
ASKED A QUESTION,

15:37.507 --> 15:40.340
WE'LL DISTRACT HER
AND ANSWER IT FOR YOU.

15:40.340 --> 15:42.572
GOT IT?

15:44.044 --> 15:45.215
GOT IT, ADAM?

15:46.716 --> 15:48.078
ADAM!

15:48.078 --> 15:50.420
WHAT?! I THOUGHT YOU WERE
GONNA ANSWER IT FOR ME.

15:50.420 --> 15:54.124
GUYS, GET WITH THE PROGRAM.

15:54.124 --> 15:56.256
( door opens )

16:00.730 --> 16:02.462
OKAY.

16:03.733 --> 16:06.266
LET'S START THE INTERROGATION.

16:08.338 --> 16:11.141
EVERYBODY COMFORTABLE?
TEMPERATURE OKAY?

16:11.141 --> 16:13.603
REFRESH YOUR DRINKS? NO?

16:13.603 --> 16:14.974
GOOD.

16:17.377 --> 16:19.449
WHAT IS THE SO-CALLED MISSION?!

16:21.311 --> 16:24.314
CAN I JUST SAY THAT
YOUR HAIR LOOKS GREAT!

16:24.314 --> 16:26.516
UH, WHO IS DOING IT THESE DAYS?

16:26.516 --> 16:28.518
FERNANDO OVER AT
THE WIG CONNECTION.

16:28.518 --> 16:30.720
HE'S A GENIUS.
IT'S MOSTLY RACCOON.

16:32.622 --> 16:35.195
BUT THAT'S NOT THE POINT!

16:36.626 --> 16:42.502
WHY WERE YOU TALKING ABOUT
GOING ON A SO-CALLED MISSION?!

16:42.502 --> 16:45.375
ARE YOU SURE
HE ACTUALLY SAID THAT?

16:45.375 --> 16:49.279
UH, COUNTLESS
SCIENTIFIC STUDIES HAVE PROVEN
THAT PEOPLE PERCEIVE REALITY--

16:49.279 --> 16:51.141
DON'T TRY TO DISTRACT ME,
SQUAT MUG!

16:52.612 --> 16:54.144
WHEN YOU'RE HUNTING BIG GAME,

16:54.144 --> 16:55.785
YOU HAVE TO SEPARATE
THE WEAKEST FROM THE PACK.

16:55.785 --> 16:57.217
MM-HMM.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.721
YOU TWO, SCRAM!

17:01.721 --> 17:03.753
FUNNY STORY,
THE WORD "SCRAM"--

17:03.753 --> 17:04.753
I SAID SCRAM!

17:04.753 --> 17:06.396
OKAY!

17:09.598 --> 17:11.060
( sighs ) GREAT.

17:11.060 --> 17:13.063
ADAM'S TOTALLY GONNA CRACK
UNDER PRESSURE.

17:13.063 --> 17:18.568
NO, NO, HE ALWAYS COMES THROUGH
WHEN IT COUNTS... OR NOT.

17:20.039 --> 17:26.476
( no audio )

17:34.224 --> 17:36.556
HE TOLD ME EVERYTHING.

17:36.556 --> 17:40.230
NOW I KNOW ALL YOUR
DIRTY LITTLE SECRETS!

17:40.230 --> 17:43.293
HA! ( chuckles )

17:51.141 --> 17:53.573
THIS WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO HAPPEN!

17:53.573 --> 17:55.575
REALLY? 'CAUSE WHEN
I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,

17:55.575 --> 17:59.609
I WAS SO HOPING I WOULD BE
PUREED IN A BANANA SUIT.

17:59.609 --> 18:04.114
WHAT IF WE JAMMED
SOMETHING IN THE BLADES?
WOULD THAT STOP THE TURBINE?

18:04.114 --> 18:06.786
MAYBE, BUT THERE'S NOTHING
BIG ENOUGH DOWN HERE.

18:06.786 --> 18:08.718
I CAN THINK OF SOMETHING.

18:10.590 --> 18:13.593
WAIT, YOU DON'T MEAN...
OH, NO. NO, NO, NO, NO.

18:13.593 --> 18:15.295
UH, PUT IT TO A VOTE?

18:15.295 --> 18:17.227
I VOTE EDDY!
 ME, TOO!

18:17.227 --> 18:18.228
( grunts )

18:18.228 --> 18:19.229
NO!

18:20.600 --> 18:23.603
PUSH THAT BUTTON AND SEAL
THE CONTAINMENT TUNNEL!

18:25.335 --> 18:27.637
( tunnel closes )

18:27.637 --> 18:32.612
IT WORKED!
WAY TO GO, LEO!
 YES!

18:32.612 --> 18:38.788
( groaning )

18:38.788 --> 18:41.191
IS THAT YOU, DONNIE?

18:41.191 --> 18:43.293
I'M HERE, EDDY.

18:43.293 --> 18:47.757
THE LIGHT IS SO DIM.
IT'S SO COLD.

18:47.757 --> 18:49.299
YOU LOOK...

18:49.299 --> 18:50.760
SMALLER.

18:50.760 --> 18:54.434
YOU'RE DYING, EDDY.
WRAP IT UP.

18:54.434 --> 18:57.437
I NEED YOU TO DO
SOMETHING FOR ME.

18:57.437 --> 19:00.770
TELL TASHA...

19:00.770 --> 19:02.642
IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN HER.

19:07.777 --> 19:09.719
( beeping )

19:09.719 --> 19:11.451
WELL, THAT SHOULD DO IT.

19:11.451 --> 19:12.452
( beeping )

19:12.452 --> 19:13.753
IT'S ABOUT TIME!

19:13.753 --> 19:15.855
HEY, WHERE'S THE REST OF ME?!

19:15.855 --> 19:18.628
I'M SORRY, EDDY.
WE COULDN'T SAVE YOUR BODY.

19:18.628 --> 19:21.931
BUT TO BE HONEST,
WE DIDN'T EVEN TRY.
 NO.

19:21.931 --> 19:24.734
WE'RE HERE, MR. DAVENPORT!
WHAT'S THE URGENT MISSION?!

19:24.734 --> 19:25.795
YOU MISSED IT.

19:25.795 --> 19:28.698
LUCKILY, LEO HERE
SAVED OUR BUTTS.

19:28.698 --> 19:30.670
NO, SERIOUSLY,
WHAT'S THE MISSION?

19:30.670 --> 19:33.673
I'M NOT KIDDING.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.345
LEO REALLY STEPPED IT UP TODAY.

19:35.345 --> 19:38.678
HE SHOWED ME THAT
HE HAS WHAT IT TAKES
TO BE A PART OF THIS TEAM.

19:38.678 --> 19:44.214
SO I AM MAKING HIM OUR NEW
STRATEGIC MISSION SPECIALIST.

19:44.214 --> 19:45.385
CONGRATS.
 WAY TO GO.

19:45.385 --> 19:46.756
MAZEL TOV!

19:48.558 --> 19:51.261
AWESOME! WAIT,
DOES THAT MEAN MORE PAPERWORK?

19:51.261 --> 19:53.263
( laughs ) YES.

19:53.263 --> 19:56.266
BUT YOU WILL ALSO BE
HELPING ME DESIGN

19:56.266 --> 19:57.897
THE OVERALL MISSION STRATEGIES,

19:57.897 --> 20:00.630
AND WHILE THESE GUYS
ARE IN THE FIELD,

20:00.630 --> 20:03.733
YOU WILL BE ASSISTING ME
FROM YOUR OWN...

20:03.733 --> 20:06.976
MISSION SPECIALIST WORKSTATION!

20:06.976 --> 20:09.939
REALLY? THIS IS MINE NOW?

20:09.939 --> 20:14.314
ACCORDING TO THIS FANCY
DIGITAL NAMEPLATE, IT IS.

20:16.215 --> 20:18.748
AH-AH-AH, FINGERPRINTS.

20:19.989 --> 20:23.923
WOW. I'M OFFICIALLY ON THE TEAM.

20:23.923 --> 20:27.297
I HAVE MY OWN PLACE IN THE LAB
AND I'LL FINALLY HAVE INPUT.

20:27.297 --> 20:32.262
SOUNDS LIKE THE KIND OF POSITION
THAT SHOULD COME WITH A SERIOUS
INCREASE IN ALLOWANCE.

20:32.262 --> 20:34.964
OR I COULD ELIMINATE
THE POSITION ENTIRELY.

20:34.964 --> 20:37.667
WE'LL TALK ABOUT
THE MONEY LATER.

20:44.774 --> 20:47.417
SO HOW DID YOU GUYS
GET OUT OF PERRY'S PRISON?

20:47.417 --> 20:50.680
YEAH, ABOUT THAT...

20:50.680 --> 20:51.981
FUNNY STORY...

20:51.981 --> 20:53.583
PERRY INTERROGATED US

20:53.583 --> 20:56.756
AND ADAM GAVE HER SOME
VERY DAMAGING INFORMATION.

20:57.827 --> 21:01.831
WE ARE ALWAYS MISSING SCHOOL
BECAUSE OF LEO.

21:01.831 --> 21:05.695
HE'S ALWAYS PLAYING
THESE CRAZY PRANKS ON US.
HE CALLS THEM MISSIONS.

21:05.695 --> 21:08.698
AND HE'S ACTUALLY
STRONGER THAN I AM.

21:08.698 --> 21:10.900
CHASE THINKS HE'S GOT
SOMETHING MISSING UP HERE,

21:10.900 --> 21:14.804
AND BREE JUST TRIES
TO RUN AWAY FROM HIM.

21:14.804 --> 21:16.946
YOU KINDA LOST ME
AT THE END THERE,

21:16.946 --> 21:21.411
BUT IF IT MEANS I STILL GET
TO PUNISH DOOLEY, I'M ON BOARD!

21:25.855 --> 21:27.457
SO NOW YOU GOT DETENTION...

21:27.457 --> 21:28.618
FOR A MONTH.

21:28.618 --> 21:31.861
WHAT?! BUT THAT'S NOT FAIR!

21:31.861 --> 21:34.994
NO, IT REALLY ISN'T.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.427
WELL, YOU HAVE FUN.

21:41.731 --> 21:44.834
♪♪
