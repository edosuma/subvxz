00:19.719 --> 00:23.455
<i>I love them.</i>
<i>I think you're going</i>
<i>to love them.</i>

00:23.457 --> 00:25.257
<i>I think it's going to</i>
<i>change your life</i>
<i>the way it's changed min.</i>

00:25.259 --> 00:26.892
<i>They're really...
I'm excited to show you.</i>

00:26.894 --> 00:30.062
<i>They are the best products
I've ever used.</i>

00:30.064 --> 00:31.764
Credit card number is

00:31.766 --> 00:38.404
6011-5879-1835-9498.

00:40.040 --> 00:44.009
Great. 53141666.

00:49.849 --> 00:52.484
<i>And this is more pastel-y
but I love them both.</i>

00:52.486 --> 00:54.887
Security code 609.

00:54.889 --> 00:56.321
<i>You know it still looks good</i>

00:56.323 --> 00:57.856
<i>but, like, it could look better.</i>

00:57.858 --> 01:01.393
I'm sorry.
Can you try 603?

01:02.796 --> 01:04.663
Social security?
You don't need that.

01:07.434 --> 01:08.967
Okay, I'll hold.

01:10.904 --> 01:14.640
<i>And I was like,</i>
<i>"You know what?</i>
<i>I'm worth it."</i>

01:19.446 --> 01:20.646
Hello?

01:21.181 --> 01:23.215
How's that sound?

01:23.217 --> 01:25.717
Yes, we have the new ones.

01:25.719 --> 01:27.786
Yes, three?
Sure, we can do that.

01:27.788 --> 01:29.021
She's not home right now.

01:38.965 --> 01:41.066
We have to go to the bank.

01:41.068 --> 01:44.403
These fucking Craigslisters.
Everything's going
to be there.

01:44.405 --> 01:46.538
Babe.
Yes, I know.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.341
I'm gonna use the van
for a little bit, okay?
Tomorrow.

01:51.611 --> 01:52.911
See you later.

01:56.816 --> 01:59.551
Mmm. Yes,
that's correct.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.353
They haven't made
the last eight payments.

02:03.790 --> 02:04.857
Okay.

02:05.926 --> 02:07.793
Can you put us last?

02:07.795 --> 02:10.229
You will need to be current
on your payments

02:10.231 --> 02:13.332
to start the modification
process.

02:14.267 --> 02:15.767
I'm sorry, but...

02:15.769 --> 02:18.804
What do we need
to come up with
to stay in the house?

02:18.806 --> 02:20.339
In English, please.
Excuse me.

02:22.375 --> 02:24.810
I'm sorry.
Um, to be current?

02:26.045 --> 02:27.146
Twenty thousand.

03:50.663 --> 03:51.964
Fuck, it's so loud.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.234
Turn it down.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.936
Claudia, turn it down.

04:02.842 --> 04:04.042
Larry, let's head back.

04:05.011 --> 04:06.245
We've got one more.

04:06.247 --> 04:07.379
No, we're done.

04:08.381 --> 04:10.015
It's already set up.

04:29.669 --> 04:30.769
Hey.

04:31.437 --> 04:32.938
I thought that was you.

04:34.674 --> 04:36.141
Marissa.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.509
No, yeah, I remember.

04:37.511 --> 04:40.078
You're, like, the last person
I expected to see here.

04:40.080 --> 04:41.446
Well, how's life?

04:41.448 --> 04:42.981
Good. It's really good.

04:42.983 --> 04:45.517
I'm not pregnant,
I'm not married.

04:45.519 --> 04:48.487
Are you in school
or anything?
No, no, I'm not.

04:49.355 --> 04:50.555
But I'm sure you...

04:50.557 --> 04:52.457
Yeah, I am, it's...

04:52.459 --> 04:56.928
Pretty tough. I'm really
stressed out about it
but I figure, like,

04:56.930 --> 04:59.731
all the work will
pay off and...
Yeah.

04:59.733 --> 05:00.866
You know, it'll be worth it.

05:00.868 --> 05:02.100
Ah...

05:02.102 --> 05:04.069
You should come
have a drink with me.

05:04.071 --> 05:05.704
Catch up.

05:07.040 --> 05:08.874
Hey, I'm going to be
right back, okay?

05:08.876 --> 05:10.409
I have to go to the bathroom.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.643
Okay.

06:17.143 --> 06:18.243
She's not in the system.

06:21.514 --> 06:23.081
Check with Immigration.

06:56.015 --> 06:59.351
Now, because of your age
and the fact that you have
no prior record,

06:59.353 --> 07:00.986
the DA is willing
to give you probation

07:00.988 --> 07:02.954
in exchange for a guilty plea.

07:02.956 --> 07:05.724
However, because you were
in custody while waiting
to post bail,

07:05.726 --> 07:09.027
they have placed
an immigration
detainer on you.

07:09.029 --> 07:11.396
After you plead guilty,
you will be handcuffed

07:11.398 --> 07:14.699
and transported
to an immigration
detention facility.

07:14.701 --> 07:18.570
They'll hold you there
a few days or a few weeks
until they process you.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.840
And then you will be
released back into Mexico
as a free citizen.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.476
You'll never be allowed
back into the United States.

07:25.912 --> 07:28.146
And if I don't plead guilty?

07:28.148 --> 07:29.848
Based upon the discovery
that I've seen,

07:29.850 --> 07:32.517
they have an extremely
strong case against you.

07:34.053 --> 07:35.987
Go now with probation,

07:35.989 --> 07:39.357
or you can spend
a couple of years in jail
and then be deported.

07:40.193 --> 07:41.927
Those are the two options.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.531
Are you in contact
with any relatives
in Mexico?

07:46.533 --> 07:48.633
Family? Friends?
Yes.

07:51.771 --> 07:54.639
Okay, well,
I'll give you two a couple
of minutes by yourself.

08:09.822 --> 08:11.356
It's not your fault.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.061
It's my fault.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.164
I brought you here.

08:19.932 --> 08:21.733
I taught you that...

08:22.468 --> 08:25.237
That you were special.

08:25.239 --> 08:27.973
That you deserved
the nicest things.
Mom, calm down.

08:29.408 --> 08:31.476
I'll come back.

08:31.478 --> 08:34.011
I'll get some money together
and I'll come back.

08:35.381 --> 08:37.115
People do it all the time.

08:38.951 --> 08:41.119
You think everything
is easy, huh?

08:48.861 --> 08:50.795
Can you wait, please?

08:50.797 --> 08:52.597
Please, don't take her yet.

08:55.501 --> 08:57.836
You have to go
to your father's house.

08:57.838 --> 08:59.337
I need to know you will be safe.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.658
Criminal gangs
consider you rich targets.

09:21.027 --> 09:22.894
They will try to contact

09:22.896 --> 09:25.430
phone numbers of your
relatives in the US
for ransom.

09:26.666 --> 09:29.334
Dial zero after making
calls on public phones

09:29.336 --> 09:32.571
so previously dialed numbers
can't be accessed.

10:08.007 --> 10:10.375
Think your fences
can keep me out?

10:12.111 --> 10:13.612
Assholes.

10:13.614 --> 10:18.717
Hey, girl! Keep moving.
Keep moving forward!

10:18.719 --> 10:20.218
I'll be back.
Not to see you.

10:20.220 --> 10:23.188
But I'm going to be over there
in Chicago in one week.

11:13.306 --> 11:14.806
Friend!

11:14.808 --> 11:16.341
Friend.

11:16.343 --> 11:19.077
You want some minutes
to make a call?

11:19.912 --> 11:21.579
You can use my cell phone.

11:23.582 --> 11:25.250
I have minutes.

11:42.601 --> 11:44.903
Do you need help?

11:54.013 --> 11:56.247
Hey.

11:56.249 --> 11:58.650
Check this out.
Can you do me a favor?

11:58.652 --> 12:01.152
This girl wants to
go to the south.

12:28.881 --> 12:31.249
What's going on?
A checkpoint.

12:34.720 --> 12:35.787
Where are you headed?

12:35.789 --> 12:37.422
Just ahead, about 10,
15 kilometers.

12:46.566 --> 12:48.066
What's the status here?

12:48.068 --> 12:50.068
How many passengers
are with you?

12:50.070 --> 12:51.669
Seven people.

12:57.042 --> 12:58.243
Okay, good.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.878
Have a good trip.
See you later.

12:59.880 --> 13:00.979
Okay, thank you.

14:07.913 --> 14:09.047
Sit down.

14:11.517 --> 14:12.717
There are things to do.

14:16.255 --> 14:19.490
Are you, or aren't you
a criminal?

14:21.760 --> 14:23.561
There's no in between.

14:26.465 --> 14:27.765
Speak!

14:28.601 --> 14:30.568
What's the matter with you?

14:30.570 --> 14:32.170
She can't understand you, Mama.

14:33.105 --> 14:34.873
She doesn't speak Spanish.

16:06.165 --> 16:08.232
You can't stay
in the house all day.

16:15.408 --> 16:17.308
What do you want me to do?

16:18.577 --> 16:22.080
Well, be patient.
Try to understand her.

16:24.316 --> 16:27.185
How long are we going
to let this go on?

16:27.187 --> 16:29.320
As long as necessary.

16:31.056 --> 16:32.824
Okay, whatever.

16:39.631 --> 16:40.832
Fuck.

16:46.271 --> 16:47.772
You speak English?

16:48.640 --> 16:50.074
Yes, of course.

16:59.785 --> 17:01.619
Arturo.
Claudia.

17:14.133 --> 17:15.266
Claudia.

17:16.602 --> 17:18.736
We're gonna go fix fences.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.003
Coming with us.

17:24.242 --> 17:25.476
How much?

17:26.912 --> 17:28.413
Close to $10.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.715
An hour?

17:32.117 --> 17:33.284
A day.

17:42.828 --> 17:43.961
I'll work with him.

18:02.681 --> 18:04.148
That's very delicate.

18:05.551 --> 18:07.485
Why don't you help me with this?

18:08.987 --> 18:11.389
Just cut it like this.

18:12.925 --> 18:14.158
Be careful.

18:16.195 --> 18:17.428
Put these on.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.804
How many do we have left?

18:26.806 --> 18:31.843
From here, four or five
posts on this line,
and that's it.

18:33.145 --> 18:36.013
Okay, let's finish
what's left and then

18:36.015 --> 18:39.917
we'll go to the other side
of the ranch.

18:41.086 --> 18:43.821
You should use better materials.

18:43.823 --> 18:45.022
Something that lasts.

18:46.692 --> 18:49.260
You're gonna start here
and you're gonna keep going.

18:49.262 --> 18:51.596
The whole south fence
needs to be repaired.

18:51.598 --> 18:53.264
Then you'll start
on the north side.

18:56.835 --> 19:00.605
Keeps the cows in,
people out.
Works just fine.

19:12.218 --> 19:13.551
This sucks.

19:17.689 --> 19:19.857
You should have
stayed in prison then.

19:21.593 --> 19:23.794
Would have been
better than this.

19:26.665 --> 19:29.000
Well, I can take you
back if you want.

19:30.435 --> 19:31.969
Get on the horse and...

19:32.905 --> 19:34.105
Let's do it.

19:55.061 --> 19:57.695
Hold her head, please.

20:09.141 --> 20:11.442
You wanna get kicked?

20:11.444 --> 20:13.444
Stand there
if you wanna get kicked.

20:56.321 --> 20:58.122
Claudia, take it.

21:07.766 --> 21:09.200
You see plastic,

21:10.035 --> 21:11.569
you pick it up.

21:12.638 --> 21:14.872
Is this normal?

21:14.874 --> 21:17.275
Yeah,
it's the same problem,
over and over.

21:18.677 --> 21:21.078
Animals are stubborn.

21:21.080 --> 21:22.980
They only know one way to be.

21:25.417 --> 21:27.151
Even if it hurts them.

21:36.461 --> 21:38.396
I don't wanna go inside
that house with him.

21:41.566 --> 21:43.134
Well, he's your dad.

21:59.685 --> 22:00.851
Thank you.

22:04.489 --> 22:07.525
Hey, why is there a checkpoint?

22:07.527 --> 22:10.695
Is somebody smuggling
drugs, people?

22:11.263 --> 22:13.230
No, not people.

22:13.232 --> 22:18.002
The military uses it
to control whatever
is passing through.

22:20.272 --> 22:22.773
Do you know someone
who can help me get back?

22:28.046 --> 22:29.947
Andres wouldn't like that.

22:29.949 --> 22:32.283
I don't care what Andres thinks.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.358
<i>Bueno.</i>

22:48.133 --> 22:49.567
Was that Andres?

22:50.402 --> 22:51.769
It's no one.

22:52.471 --> 22:53.838
Get to work.

23:17.829 --> 23:19.463
Congratulations.

23:21.600 --> 23:23.033
I got something.

24:00.972 --> 24:03.307
Stop! Stop!

24:13.185 --> 24:14.819
You're an American?

24:30.969 --> 24:32.102
Arturo.

24:34.807 --> 24:36.607
You going for a jog
in the desert, bro?

24:47.552 --> 24:48.786
Think he's a good guy, right?

24:52.558 --> 24:54.758
What's going on, Ricky?

24:59.498 --> 25:02.266
Why show up like this?

25:06.104 --> 25:08.138
Why don't you tell her
what's going on?

25:13.478 --> 25:15.279
Nothing is going on.

25:16.882 --> 25:18.749
Tell her who you work for.

25:18.751 --> 25:19.917
In English.

25:29.794 --> 25:30.895
Here.

25:31.496 --> 25:32.663
Say it.

25:36.501 --> 25:37.635
Say it.

25:40.071 --> 25:41.205
I work for Ricky.

25:42.574 --> 25:43.707
You can call me Rick.

25:48.947 --> 25:50.548
You work for me? Mmm?

25:53.919 --> 25:55.119
That's not what I heard.

25:56.621 --> 25:59.690
I heard you were working
for someone else.

26:01.928 --> 26:04.528
Why would I wanna do that?

26:04.530 --> 26:06.864
Look,

26:06.866 --> 26:10.267
the truth is that
the Sergeant talked to me,

26:10.269 --> 26:16.240
and, yeah, he offered me money
to give him information,

26:16.242 --> 26:20.210
but you don't think
I'd do something like that?
I'm not a traitor.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.212
Ricky, you know I would
never do that, right?

26:24.483 --> 26:27.451
But we're friends, right?

26:35.160 --> 26:36.794
But you know the deal.

26:42.434 --> 26:44.101
You mess with my stuff,

26:49.507 --> 26:50.908
I have to kill you.

26:54.512 --> 26:56.547
And I have to kill
<i>la</i> pocha here.

27:05.657 --> 27:07.491
We're friends?

27:30.682 --> 27:33.117
You're gonna tell Ricky
that you're gonna help him.

27:34.386 --> 27:36.086
Just tell him that
you know the ranch.

27:36.088 --> 27:37.488
I don't.
Well, learn it.

27:40.792 --> 27:42.059
Listen to me.

27:42.061 --> 27:44.862
Just help him get his stuff
from one side to the other.

28:00.679 --> 28:01.945
Don't tell him, please.

28:02.714 --> 28:03.914
Don't tell Andres.

28:32.844 --> 28:34.478
I know my way around the ranch.

28:36.981 --> 28:39.416
I can make things
really easy for you.

28:42.520 --> 28:44.221
I like American girls.

28:54.232 --> 28:56.033
I'm gonna take care
of your truck.

28:57.969 --> 28:59.103
Be in touch.

29:08.279 --> 29:09.379
I gotta run.

30:29.195 --> 30:30.828
Good afternoon, sir.

30:31.462 --> 30:32.596
Good afternoon.

30:33.431 --> 30:34.565
Nice day, no?

30:37.335 --> 30:39.069
What brings you here, gentlemen?

30:39.804 --> 30:41.471
I'm looking for Arturo.

30:45.543 --> 30:47.144
Claudia.

30:47.146 --> 30:48.345
Come here.

31:11.436 --> 31:12.569
Where's Arturo?

31:16.140 --> 31:17.307
I don't know.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.217
He took your truck.

31:27.219 --> 31:28.886
I don't know where he went.

31:31.422 --> 31:32.556
You see?

31:33.558 --> 31:34.691
He's not here.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.662
Are you visiting?

31:38.664 --> 31:41.398
She's only here
for a little bit.

31:41.400 --> 31:43.300
Go inside.
Lita needs you.

31:47.705 --> 31:49.606
You have a beautiful ranch.

31:49.608 --> 31:51.608
A lot of land.

31:53.177 --> 31:55.646
Must be hard to maintain.

31:56.447 --> 31:57.581
To keep secure.

32:03.054 --> 32:06.957
Here, we don't have
any problems with the ranch.

32:06.959 --> 32:09.793
Excuse me. I have work to do.

32:25.810 --> 32:28.378
Don't let them involve us
into their mess.

32:29.447 --> 32:31.048
People are always
driving through my land

32:31.050 --> 32:33.350
looking for a shortcut
to the main road.

32:36.120 --> 32:37.821
It's always been a problem.

32:41.392 --> 32:42.826
If you see Arturo,

32:44.662 --> 32:46.063
you send him to me.

32:48.166 --> 32:50.300
Fucking reception, man.

33:46.591 --> 33:47.758
Okay, Mom.

33:49.894 --> 33:51.028
Bye.

34:03.709 --> 34:04.841
Tell her to try it.

34:14.685 --> 34:16.453
Make her try it.

34:16.455 --> 34:18.755
You're her father.

34:38.141 --> 34:39.943
I've eaten a chili before.

35:48.379 --> 35:50.180
This is my nephew.

35:50.182 --> 35:52.082
That's not true.

35:55.419 --> 35:56.953
You fixed the truck?

35:58.990 --> 36:00.657
It's not done yet.

36:03.461 --> 36:05.195
Come take a ride with me.

36:06.030 --> 36:07.764
Got a meeting.

36:09.735 --> 36:12.502
No, no, no, look,
shut up for a second.

36:12.504 --> 36:14.237
This is what we're gonna do.

36:14.239 --> 36:16.373
You're gonna go to his house.

36:16.375 --> 36:19.543
You're gonna tell him
to return the money because
we already agreed on a price.

36:19.545 --> 36:22.679
Under no circumstances
are we giving him
any more money, okay?

36:25.917 --> 36:27.651
Fucking Mexicans.

36:30.054 --> 36:31.488
Aren't you Mexican?

36:33.324 --> 36:34.791
No, I'm not fucking Mexican.

36:37.061 --> 36:40.230
I'm just... I'm stationed
down here for a bit.

36:42.233 --> 36:44.501
Too valuable for this
shithole anyway.

36:45.603 --> 36:48.638
You know what I mean, right?

36:48.640 --> 36:52.342
I came down here because
things used to be
so fucking easy.

36:53.444 --> 36:56.713
People just took
the world as it is.

36:56.715 --> 36:59.583
They just took
what you gave them,
no questions asked.

37:00.952 --> 37:05.288
And now, that's all gone.
It's a fucking zoo.

37:05.290 --> 37:08.425
If you could be
anywhere else right now,
where would you be?

37:09.527 --> 37:12.229
Would you be with me?
Or would I be alone?

37:46.932 --> 37:48.765
I didn't bring my passport.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.467
It's all right.
You don't need it.

37:53.537 --> 37:55.338
Open the glove compartment.

37:59.644 --> 38:01.077
Hand me those cards.

38:05.783 --> 38:07.917
Good.

38:07.919 --> 38:10.920
Relax. With the cards,
I come and go
whenever I want.

38:17.028 --> 38:18.628
Good evening, sir.

38:18.630 --> 38:20.497
Where are you headed?
San Diego.

38:20.499 --> 38:21.665
It's, um...

38:23.501 --> 38:24.834
It's our anniversary.

38:31.442 --> 38:32.609
Have a nice night.

38:33.077 --> 38:34.244
Thank you.

39:21.126 --> 39:22.525
Yeah, you could
make a run for it.

39:23.994 --> 39:25.228
But then what?

39:27.231 --> 39:29.032
I know about you, Claudia.

39:30.668 --> 39:32.001
About all of it.

39:33.804 --> 39:39.743
You wanna be some poor illegal
working shitty jobs?

39:40.611 --> 39:42.278
Shit, I couldn't do that.

39:45.583 --> 39:47.283
But if that's what you want,

39:49.487 --> 39:50.620
then go.

39:54.092 --> 39:55.692
I'm not going to stop you.

39:57.328 --> 39:59.529
Or you could
help me out a little bit.

40:00.631 --> 40:02.866
Do a few runs.

40:02.868 --> 40:05.068
Make some easy, easy money.

40:06.303 --> 40:07.971
And then I'll bring you back.

40:18.516 --> 40:20.550
Think it over.

40:20.552 --> 40:22.819
Go grab a cup of coffee
or something.

40:23.821 --> 40:26.423
Need to have a chat
with my dudes here.

42:36.587 --> 42:38.855
You just come and go
as you please?

43:02.513 --> 43:04.414
I still haven't
heard from Arturo.

43:13.924 --> 43:16.292
There's some food
if you did not eat.

43:45.123 --> 43:46.456
You want some more?

43:46.458 --> 43:47.991
No, thanks, Mom.

43:55.466 --> 43:57.467
You mind if I come out
with you today?

44:03.341 --> 44:05.708
What did she say?

44:22.026 --> 44:23.259
People are sneaking in.

44:24.328 --> 44:25.895
Stealing it for food.

44:28.165 --> 44:30.433
It all has to go or

44:32.169 --> 44:33.736
they'll keep coming.

44:39.510 --> 44:41.978
If they're hungry,
why don't you let them
have it?

44:41.980 --> 44:43.846
'Cause the cows are hungry, too.

44:45.516 --> 44:47.817
Okay, hold it up higher.

44:50.088 --> 44:51.421
Away from your body.

44:52.222 --> 44:53.723
Wait. Wait. Wait.

44:54.124 --> 44:55.324
<i>Ola.</i>

45:18.982 --> 45:21.451
When I was a boy,

45:21.453 --> 45:23.453
I used to love
setting things on fire.

45:29.293 --> 45:32.795
My father asked me to
weed his garden,

45:32.797 --> 45:34.430
and I burned it all.

45:35.999 --> 45:37.800
<i>I didn't mean to burn it all.</i>

45:47.111 --> 45:49.178
<i>Ready to roll, pocha?</i>

45:49.180 --> 45:50.913
<i>Keep doing what you're doing.</i>

45:51.949 --> 45:53.483
<i>You know your way around.</i>

45:56.353 --> 45:58.788
<i>Just make sure my stuff
gets across the ranch.</i>

46:01.191 --> 46:02.825
<i>What's the matter?
Don't you trust me?</i>

46:02.827 --> 46:05.294
Where's our truck?
<i>Relax.</i>

46:06.029 --> 46:07.330
<i>We'll drop it off.</i>

46:22.146 --> 46:23.813
<i>Don't worry.
My dudes are cool.</i>

46:23.815 --> 46:26.816
<i>Don't think about it.</i>
<i>Just get them through,</i>
<i>fast and easy.</i>

46:26.818 --> 46:28.251
Yeah, I got it.

46:38.529 --> 46:41.697
<i>Lita and I,</i>
<i>we committed ourselves</i>
<i>to this place.</i>

46:41.699 --> 46:44.033
<i>They said that the land
was too rocky.</i>

46:46.570 --> 46:50.306
<i>That I would always</i>
<i>be at its mercy and</i>
<i>I would make no money.</i>

46:53.911 --> 46:55.778
<i>But I'm still here.</i>

47:04.788 --> 47:07.990
<i>Everything from the outside
can ruin you.</i>

47:07.992 --> 47:09.292
<i>If you let it.</i>

49:36.908 --> 49:38.040
Good evening.

49:38.042 --> 49:39.141
Good evening.

49:43.680 --> 49:44.947
Hands on the wheel.

49:48.185 --> 49:49.986
Turn off the car.

49:52.255 --> 49:53.422
Come on.

49:53.424 --> 49:54.590
Get out.

49:56.893 --> 49:57.994
Search it.

49:58.462 --> 49:59.762
Get out.

50:02.232 --> 50:04.233
Sergeant!

50:14.244 --> 50:15.511
Let her go.

50:34.631 --> 50:36.232
Your father know where you are?

50:36.800 --> 50:38.968
Yeah.

50:38.970 --> 50:41.303
Does he know who you're with?

50:41.305 --> 50:43.906
I was in town,
and he offered me a ride.

50:46.743 --> 50:48.744
Bring back the truck.

50:49.679 --> 50:51.080
Come.

51:21.044 --> 51:22.978
They sent me here to stop this.

51:26.616 --> 51:28.217
Ricky's truck is clean.

51:29.820 --> 51:30.886
Okay.

51:32.522 --> 51:34.657
Let him go.

51:38.462 --> 51:40.129
It wasn't always this way.

51:41.832 --> 51:43.332
Some places, maybe.

51:45.068 --> 51:46.769
But here, things were
always contained.

51:49.372 --> 51:50.739
I can help you.

52:03.120 --> 52:04.820
Ready to roll, pocha?

52:41.191 --> 52:44.460
Whatever you were
paying Arturo,
it's not enough.

52:47.664 --> 52:49.532
You want a raise already?

54:12.782 --> 54:14.450
This is Arturo's phone.

54:19.356 --> 54:20.923
Why do you have it?

54:30.468 --> 54:31.734
Andres, come!

55:21.352 --> 55:27.690
I've given
the Sergeant permission
to run patrols on our land.

55:30.727 --> 55:33.162
Nice truck!

56:18.041 --> 56:19.341
This is my truck.

56:21.778 --> 56:24.279
Now, I need you to tell me
everything, right now.

56:25.081 --> 56:26.281
And don't lie to me.

56:28.017 --> 56:29.118
This is my whole life.

56:30.587 --> 56:32.054
Don't you see that?

56:32.056 --> 56:33.522
I could lose everything.

56:35.358 --> 56:36.759
He's dead.

56:46.069 --> 56:47.169
No.

56:50.740 --> 56:54.843
I told you she never should
have come to stay with us.

56:55.512 --> 56:56.945
Andres, no.

56:56.947 --> 56:59.448
Everything out of her mouth
is garbage.

56:59.450 --> 57:01.316
If she doesn't know
how to be good,

57:01.318 --> 57:03.352
then it's your job to teach her.

57:04.788 --> 57:06.789
Arturo wanted more.

57:06.791 --> 57:09.591
There are people who struggle
and people who get
what they want.

57:09.593 --> 57:10.993
I want more.

57:10.995 --> 57:12.161
Yeah?

57:15.899 --> 57:17.900
Is this what more
looks like to you?

57:18.301 --> 57:20.002
"Pocha"?

57:20.004 --> 57:23.272
You know what that means?
Yeah, I know what it means.

57:27.210 --> 57:29.244
It means you're a fraud.

57:31.548 --> 57:36.318
Fruit is either ripe or rotten.

57:36.320 --> 57:38.520
Not both.

57:41.124 --> 57:43.759
You can stay, tell the truth.

57:44.761 --> 57:46.962
Or you take this truck
and you go.

59:01.237 --> 59:03.539
<i>Pocha? What's up?</i>

59:03.541 --> 59:05.807
<i>How about that truck?
Do you like it?</i>

59:08.545 --> 59:10.112
Where are you?

59:57.360 --> 59:59.194
Tell me you need me.

01:00:04.701 --> 01:00:06.535
Tell me you need me.

01:00:28.691 --> 01:00:29.958
Say it.

01:00:35.064 --> 01:00:36.331
Say it.

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:55.183
Say it.

01:01:01.524 --> 01:01:02.791
Say it.

01:01:12.468 --> 01:01:14.302
Tell me you need me.

01:01:31.154 --> 01:01:33.055
I need to get out of here.

01:01:33.057 --> 01:01:34.690
We're almost done.

01:01:34.692 --> 01:01:37.125
No, I need to get
out of here tonight.

01:01:38.394 --> 01:01:40.662
Everything is set up
for tomorrow.

01:01:41.564 --> 01:01:42.698
What changed?

01:01:52.475 --> 01:01:54.076
Just one more run.

01:01:55.712 --> 01:01:57.345
And then we'll move on.

01:01:58.815 --> 01:02:01.216
And tomorrow
you'll take me across?

01:02:05.955 --> 01:02:07.889
Anywhere you want to go.

01:02:24.174 --> 01:02:26.241
Good evening.

01:02:28.344 --> 01:02:30.746
You can pass.

01:03:19.930 --> 01:03:22.864
It's not time for you to go.

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:29.437
There are still things
you need to learn here.

01:03:29.439 --> 01:03:32.574
You understand me, don't you?

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:40.215
Stay here with us.

01:03:43.352 --> 01:03:48.156
Sometimes when you
love someone,
you have to forgive them.

01:03:48.891 --> 01:03:51.359
Even when you don't want to.

01:03:53.830 --> 01:03:56.998
You will lose her again.

01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:01.403
I tried, Mom.

01:04:06.843 --> 01:04:10.145
Some things can't be fixed.

01:04:25.027 --> 01:04:28.263
There are only
two types of people.

01:04:29.565 --> 01:04:33.134
Those who care about others.

01:04:33.136 --> 01:04:36.771
And those who only
care about themselves.

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:44.512
Which one are you?

01:05:52.915 --> 01:05:54.316
He's here.

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:15.303
Stay in the truck.

01:06:22.112 --> 01:06:23.578
Gentlemen.

01:06:24.647 --> 01:06:25.847
There's a change.

01:06:25.849 --> 01:06:27.582
A change?

01:06:27.584 --> 01:06:29.017
What do you mean, a change?

01:06:29.019 --> 01:06:30.151
Don't fuck with us.

01:06:30.153 --> 01:06:32.420
There's a change because
there's a change, okay.

01:06:42.631 --> 01:06:43.765
Hey.

01:06:45.368 --> 01:06:47.202
Come out.
We need to talk.

01:07:13.129 --> 01:07:14.763
Don't leave yet.

01:07:15.832 --> 01:07:16.931
Count the suitcases!

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:19.426
Fuck.

01:08:34.343 --> 01:08:35.510
Where's Andres?

01:08:35.511 --> 01:08:37.712
He went to look for you.

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:46.113
Hey.

01:09:49.919 --> 01:09:51.786
Who else is with you?

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:53.520
No one.

01:09:53.523 --> 01:09:55.256
I told you,
my family has nothing
to do with this.

01:09:55.258 --> 01:09:56.457
Turn around!

01:09:56.459 --> 01:09:57.926
Turn around.

01:09:59.895 --> 01:10:01.863
He set me up.
Shut up.

01:10:01.865 --> 01:10:03.665
Good men died because of you.

01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:08.169
I didn't know
about the others...
Move.

01:10:09.872 --> 01:10:11.372
Put them in the truck.

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:14.175
Put them in the truck.

01:10:20.182 --> 01:10:21.316
Now.

01:10:21.318 --> 01:10:22.483
Okay.

01:10:27.656 --> 01:10:29.857
This is gonna end up
bad for you.

01:10:29.859 --> 01:10:31.426
All of you will be arrested.

01:10:31.428 --> 01:10:32.961
You and your whole family.

01:12:09.491 --> 01:12:11.359
You should have listened to me.

01:12:17.466 --> 01:12:19.233
It didn't have to be so messy.

01:12:50.266 --> 01:12:53.468
This area is under
military control.

01:12:53.470 --> 01:12:56.437
We will open fire.

01:13:02.277 --> 01:13:04.011
Claudia, what are you doing?

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.334
I did this to her.

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:07.108
There's a suitcase
in the back with
some money in it.

01:19:10.212 --> 01:19:11.846
It's for my mother.

01:19:13.115 --> 01:19:15.049
Please take it to her.

01:19:23.325 --> 01:19:25.159
I'm not going with you.
