WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:06.120
        He's my only child.

00:06.120 --> 00:08.400
       He wouldn't leave me.

00:08.400 --> 00:09.800
You want to know why I came back?

00:09.800 --> 00:11.560
Nothing in this world
      is going to stop me

00:11.560 --> 00:14.120
from helping the people here
   who are hungry and homeless.

00:14.120 --> 00:17.240
Don't you think I have a right to be
at the birth of my only grandchild?

00:17.240 --> 00:18.440
It was emergency surgery.

00:18.440 --> 00:21.800
I've got to go on a diet, or my
weight's going to get me in the end.

00:21.800 --> 00:23.080
Then I'll go on a diet, too.

00:23.080 --> 00:26.040
You hurt people, Mark.
And you hurt Stephen.

00:26.040 --> 00:30.040
There's a reason you live in
   a sterile environment!

01:57.600 --> 02:01.600
Ellen!

02:02.080 --> 02:05.640
Ellen, didn't you hear me?

02:05.640 --> 02:07.680
This was in my top drawer.

02:07.680 --> 02:10.880
You know how orphan socks
drive me crazy. Where's its mate?

02:10.880 --> 02:14.880
        I don't know, Mark.

02:15.520 --> 02:18.920
I dropped both socks
down the laundry chute.

02:18.920 --> 02:22.240
The same as always.

02:22.240 --> 02:24.560
Oh, for Pete's sake!

02:24.560 --> 02:28.560
My favourite Argyll,
caught between floors!

02:30.200 --> 02:32.760
You live in a house for 27 years.

02:32.760 --> 02:36.760
Finally, everything's working right.

02:36.840 --> 02:39.160
Windows don't stick.

02:39.160 --> 02:43.160
Thermostat's accurate within
one degree. And then, kaplooey!

02:43.440 --> 02:47.440
A ten penny nail knocks
everything out of whack.

02:49.440 --> 02:52.760
Have you stopped taking
my shirts to Ling Hop?

02:52.760 --> 02:56.760
No, this is for Stephen.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.720
I want you to stop
by the Jendercek mortuary

02:59.720 --> 03:01.960
   on your way to the hospital.

03:01.960 --> 03:05.160
Wasn't there a shirt with
the suit I dropped off yesterday?

03:05.160 --> 03:07.160
               Yes.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.200
I just can't seem
to get this crease out.

03:09.200 --> 03:12.440
Why are you are ironing another
shirt if Stephen already has one?

03:12.440 --> 03:16.440
The shirt you took over
was a size 15, 33.

03:16.560 --> 03:19.720
I'm afraid the collar
will be too tight for Stephen.

03:19.720 --> 03:23.720
   This is a 15 and a half, 33.

03:28.240 --> 03:31.480
Marine report says there's
    a low-pressure system

03:31.480 --> 03:33.200
coming in from the north.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.920
We're supposed to have
      scattered showers.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.560
The sky looks clear to me.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.240
 It's going to be a beautiful day.

03:40.240 --> 03:42.280
Well, you never can tell.

03:42.280 --> 03:44.960
Meteorology is an elusive science.

03:44.960 --> 03:48.960
You know, I think my umbrella
      is in the hall closet.

03:52.680 --> 03:55.840
Watch the Valium, Ellen.

03:55.840 --> 03:58.640
Does this collar
look scorched to you?

03:58.640 --> 04:00.760
I have to get dressed.

04:00.760 --> 04:03.840
The limousine will pick us up
30 minutes before the service.

04:03.840 --> 04:07.840
I'll try to get home from
the hospital as early as possible.

04:09.120 --> 04:10.560
   When you go to the mortuary,

04:10.560 --> 04:14.560
make sure that Mr Jendercek parts
Stephen's hair on the correct side.

04:19.160 --> 04:22.440
Ellen, it's going to be
a closed casket funeral.

04:22.440 --> 04:26.440
You do know which side Stephen
parts his hair on, don't you, Mark?

04:27.160 --> 04:28.440
Left.

04:28.440 --> 04:32.440
          No, the right.

04:33.560 --> 04:35.520
Ah, this is scorched.
I have to wash another shirt.

04:35.520 --> 04:39.520
# Well, everybody better...

04:42.240 --> 04:46.240
# Because I'm on about Saturday
 night, got my back to the wall

04:46.640 --> 04:50.640
# Turn down and
freeze out, ba-da da da

04:50.720 --> 04:54.720
# Da-da, and freeze out...#

04:58.120 --> 04:59.640
            Hey, Nick.

04:59.640 --> 05:03.640
Hey. How are you doing?

05:05.880 --> 05:09.880
Like to make an appointment
to see you.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.840
Hey, Vince...

05:13.840 --> 05:15.840
  Make sure the next stuff is OK.

05:15.840 --> 05:18.880
Two cameras.
Autofocus and a built-in flash.

05:18.880 --> 05:20.480
Just like the pros used.

05:20.480 --> 05:24.240
Come on!

05:24.240 --> 05:26.880
   Get the stuff over to Tony's.

05:26.880 --> 05:29.480
  Better test it on the hot box.

05:29.480 --> 05:32.280
  He told me it was 50% Mannitol.

05:32.280 --> 05:32.840
Hey, man!

05:32.840 --> 05:35.040
Hey, man!
100 bucks is a lot of dough
to drop one baby laxative.

05:35.040 --> 05:37.800
Hey, man, maybe Tony stepped on your
stuff when he was checking it out.

05:37.800 --> 05:40.120
That's what I thought, too.

05:40.120 --> 05:44.120
Until I found this in the room.
Mannitol, Nick!

05:44.280 --> 05:46.720
 I think you owe Tony an apology.

05:46.720 --> 05:47.760
Sorry!

05:47.760 --> 05:48.240
Yes, so am I.

05:48.240 --> 05:49.280
Yes, so am I.
&lt; Hey, Vince,

05:49.280 --> 05:51.800
you want to hear something
that's really gonna blow your mind?

05:51.800 --> 05:52.880
Look, man, I can make it up to you.

05:52.880 --> 05:56.880
You keep thinking, for, like,
five, maybe ten seconds...

05:57.240 --> 05:58.080
Look, I'm sorry!

05:58.080 --> 05:59.640
Look, I'm sorry!
Why don't you get a shot of
this for my scrapbook, Vince?

05:59.640 --> 06:01.400
 Let's get this show on the road.

06:01.400 --> 06:02.360
Oh, come on man, please...

06:02.360 --> 06:03.400
Oh, come on man, please...
      Get on the table, Nick!

06:03.400 --> 06:07.400
Fool around with me again, Nick,
and you're going to be a dead melt.

06:27.800 --> 06:30.760
What the hell is this? This is
a third. I want the fourth floor.

06:30.760 --> 06:31.880
Be glad you overshot the mark, Cool.

06:31.880 --> 06:35.840
The elevator was working fine until
Dr Axelrod got on at Paediatrics.

06:35.840 --> 06:36.440
Yeah, well...

06:36.440 --> 06:37.920
Yeah, well...
                I didn't do anything!

06:37.920 --> 06:39.160
Where things are in motion,

06:39.160 --> 06:41.680
they tend to stay in motion
when he comes along for the ride.

06:41.680 --> 06:45.680
FYI, a fellow physician had
recommended daily exercise,

06:45.960 --> 06:47.760
       and responsible diet.

06:47.760 --> 06:49.160
 I've lost two and a half pounds,

06:49.160 --> 06:51.080
and already I feel
more energetic and nimble.

06:51.080 --> 06:52.200
    Can you guys help me down?

06:52.200 --> 06:52.960
Sure.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.160
Sure.
Don't let him fall on you.

06:54.160 --> 06:57.400
Don't worry, I can move pianos.

06:57.400 --> 07:00.240
Very funny.
Make all the fat jokes you want.

07:00.240 --> 07:02.600
Marcy Eiserberg and I have decided
to diet.

07:02.600 --> 07:04.720
By this time next month,
we'll have our weight under control.

07:04.720 --> 07:08.640
Which is more than you can
say about your height! Ha!

07:08.640 --> 07:11.240
Ha! I guess all fat people
    aren't jolly.

07:11.240 --> 07:13.120
The chances of beef boy
            losing weight

07:13.120 --> 07:14.960
are a little slim,
                 don't you think?

07:14.960 --> 07:15.880
Oh come on, give him a break.

07:15.880 --> 07:17.640
I mean, if he really
puts his mind to it...

07:17.640 --> 07:20.000
Yeah, well, 50 bucks
          says this time next week,

07:20.000 --> 07:21.400
he weighs exactly the same.

07:21.400 --> 07:25.400
You know, being fat
is a serious health threat, man.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.000
I mean, there's nothing
to make cheap bets about.

07:28.000 --> 07:29.960
Double or nothing, man.

07:29.960 --> 07:33.440
You don't understand, Cool.
A man's body is a temple.

07:33.440 --> 07:37.440
Yeah, well,
Axelrod's looks like a hut.

07:45.920 --> 07:46.680
Morning.

07:46.680 --> 07:48.760
Morning.
     Hello, Donald. Hi, Tommy.

07:48.760 --> 07:49.880
Tommy, you remember Dr Auschlander?

07:49.880 --> 07:51.520
    Spending the day with him?

07:51.520 --> 07:53.360
My sister-in-law Constance
is picking him later.

07:53.360 --> 07:55.480
She's coming down
 to take care of him for a while.

07:55.480 --> 07:58.200
Donald, we are going to have
a good climate for your proposal

07:58.200 --> 07:59.440
     at today's board meeting.

07:59.440 --> 08:02.840
Good. Have you had a chance to talk

08:02.840 --> 08:05.800
to that architect on remodelling
for the new Family Clinic?

08:05.800 --> 08:07.960
I thought I'd hold off on that
until after the board votes.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.040
I just want to hit the deck
running, you know what I mean?

08:10.040 --> 08:12.080
Yeah, but we have to be prepared
for some compromise upstairs.

08:12.080 --> 08:15.960
Daniel, our trustees are
compassionate, intelligent people.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.720
If I can just make them
   understand what I saw over there

08:18.720 --> 08:21.280
in those relief camps,
       there won't be a compromise.

08:21.280 --> 08:23.600
Can you believe this?
Two newspapers in Boston.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.400
One forecasting sunny and clear.

08:25.400 --> 08:29.400
The other one, partly cloudy
       and a chance of rain.

08:30.880 --> 08:33.159
We didn't expect
to see you here today.

08:33.159 --> 08:37.120
Well, I have a post-op
             patient in CCU.

08:37.120 --> 08:39.320
Have either of you
heard the forecast?

08:39.320 --> 08:41.039
Something about sprinkles.

08:41.039 --> 08:45.040
What the hell do we put
satellites up there for?

08:46.240 --> 08:48.960
You have to plan for
 a damned funeral, you know that?

08:48.960 --> 08:50.520
Like it was a birthday party.

08:50.520 --> 08:54.200
Choose a casket. Burial clothes.

08:54.200 --> 08:58.200
What liquor to serve
during calling hours.

08:58.200 --> 09:02.200
And well, get it over with,
   and move on, right?

09:03.000 --> 09:04.920
Mark, is there anything
we can do for you?

09:04.920 --> 09:08.920
I just want know if I'll need
an umbrella for my son's funeral.

09:15.720 --> 09:19.720
SHE PLAYS A TUNE

09:28.120 --> 09:30.120
That's very good!

09:30.120 --> 09:32.560
I didn't know you played.

09:32.560 --> 09:34.480
I'm a big Jethro Tull fan.

09:34.480 --> 09:36.600
          My father played clarinet.

09:36.600 --> 09:37.520
                 I took up the flute

09:37.520 --> 09:40.360
because I couldn't get
the hang of the liquorice stick.

09:40.360 --> 09:42.200
Ah, a regular virtuoso.

09:42.200 --> 09:45.880
Please! A beginner. I'm the
only person in my class over 12.

09:45.880 --> 09:47.480
And I'm never going to
get on top of my trills.

09:47.480 --> 09:49.280
Well, don't feel bad.

09:49.280 --> 09:51.640
I flunked cornet
       in the fourth grade.

09:51.640 --> 09:52.800
Listen. I was wondering,

09:52.800 --> 09:55.120
since we're going to be doing
  rotations together,

09:55.120 --> 09:56.440
maybe we could have dinner?

09:56.440 --> 09:58.600
 Are you asking me out on a date?

09:58.600 --> 10:01.440
No, absolutely not. My interest
 is strictly professional.

10:01.440 --> 10:04.840
 The ins and outs of gynaecology.

10:04.840 --> 10:06.120
            Forget it!

10:06.120 --> 10:08.000
All we're talking about
is dinner and a movie.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.040
There's a Bergman double bill
at the Orson Welles theatre.

10:10.040 --> 10:13.960
Why would anyone spend good money
to sit through four hours of Swedish?

10:13.960 --> 10:17.960
Well, because, much like myself,
it's profound. And deeply moving.

10:19.320 --> 10:21.600
      If you're a college sophomore.

10:21.600 --> 10:24.360
         I think his films are dull.

10:24.360 --> 10:27.160
    Besides, I have a recital.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.720
See you later.

10:28.720 --> 10:32.680
Dr Turner...

10:32.680 --> 10:34.280
Nice lady. You should ask her out.

10:34.280 --> 10:36.240
Why did you say that?

10:36.240 --> 10:40.080
I don't know.
Because you have a lot in common.

10:40.080 --> 10:42.520
Both doctors. Well educated.

10:42.520 --> 10:44.080
Black.

10:44.080 --> 10:46.080
Now, what has that got
to do with anything?

10:46.080 --> 10:48.160
When was the last time you saw
  a white girl

10:48.160 --> 10:51.120
with a Carl Lewis haircut?
I bet she's great in short heats.

10:51.120 --> 10:54.640
So you're telling me I should stick
to one of my own kind, is that it?

10:54.640 --> 10:56.840
I'm just saying,
               if I had the chance,

10:56.840 --> 10:58.960
I'd have her in the sack
           like a shot.

10:58.960 --> 11:00.920
Besides, Phil, let's face it,
you have a definite advantage.

11:00.920 --> 11:03.520
You know how many times somebody's
dragged me across a room

11:03.520 --> 11:06.080
in a cocktail party to meet
  the other black person there?

11:06.080 --> 11:07.720
Like we're supposed to stand around

11:07.720 --> 11:09.920
and share in the black experience
or something.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.360
Race has nothing to do with it.
This woman is hot.

11:12.360 --> 11:14.200
I never knew you were so bigoted.

11:14.200 --> 11:16.400
Don't go out with Turner, OK?

11:16.400 --> 11:19.760
Just forget I said anything.

11:19.760 --> 11:21.440
        Recital's at eight.

11:21.440 --> 11:25.440
Community Music Centre, 48 Warren
Street, if you're interested.

11:36.520 --> 11:38.800
Excuse me, madam.
My name is Douglas Wick.

11:38.800 --> 11:40.880
Would it be possible to see
   a physician

11:40.880 --> 11:42.560
at your earliest convenience?

11:42.560 --> 11:45.760
Yes. Just fill out this form.
Someone will be with you in a moment.

11:45.760 --> 11:47.200
Thanks ever so much.

11:47.200 --> 11:48.880
    Have a seat in the waiting room.

11:48.880 --> 11:51.720
May I say that you look
perfectly lovely in that frock?

11:51.720 --> 11:55.720
            Thank you.

11:56.240 --> 11:58.000
I say.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.640
Smashing, eh what?

11:59.640 --> 12:01.920
Probably has a sticky wicket.

12:01.920 --> 12:04.880
Fiscus. We finally get someone
in here with a sense of breeding,

12:04.880 --> 12:07.920
decorum, who recognises a great
looking outfit when he sees it,

12:07.920 --> 12:09.200
    and you have to take shots?

12:09.200 --> 12:11.680
Helen, you English talk like
   you're civilised,

12:11.680 --> 12:14.640
but your country has 150 magazines
devoted to spanking.

12:14.640 --> 12:16.240
      Aren't you on a break?

12:16.240 --> 12:20.240
Just leaving.

12:25.200 --> 12:29.200
Are you feeling any better?
Whoops, take it easy.

12:31.040 --> 12:32.880
                    How's your head?

12:32.880 --> 12:36.880
A couple of Seconal.
200 milligram caps, you got 'em?

12:37.920 --> 12:39.640
Do you know how long
you were unconscious?

12:39.640 --> 12:42.960
A few minutes. A few months.
I don't know.

12:42.960 --> 12:45.320
         Do you know what day it is?

12:45.320 --> 12:46.920
Yes, the first day of
the rest of my life.

12:46.920 --> 12:48.920
What is this, a public opinion poll?

12:48.920 --> 12:52.920
Just a few questions to make sure
nothing got knocked loose up there.

12:53.880 --> 12:57.400
      You know who the president is?

12:57.400 --> 13:00.320
Yeah, Coker.
Where's my cap?

13:00.320 --> 13:01.760
               Of the United States.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.440
My lens cap.
It was my grandfather's.

13:03.440 --> 13:06.320
He gave it to me for good luck.
I had it a minute ago.

13:06.320 --> 13:07.920
All right, you tell me
who the president is,

13:07.920 --> 13:09.400
and I'll help you look
for your lens cap.

13:09.400 --> 13:13.000
It's...
It's that old guy. Fancy squeeze.

13:13.000 --> 13:15.000
                      That's enough.

13:15.000 --> 13:16.600
           So you're a photographer?

13:16.600 --> 13:18.680
Yeah, I specialise in nudes.
Are you interested?

13:18.680 --> 13:22.320
How about a phone number
so I can contact your folks?

13:22.320 --> 13:25.320
They're dead.
Doubt they'll pick up.

13:25.320 --> 13:26.600
             Do you have a guardian?

13:26.600 --> 13:28.440
Alfa Home for Hoods.

13:28.440 --> 13:32.440
It's in the book, ask for Schmitty,
he's the rent-a-dad in the daytime.

13:40.440 --> 13:43.520
Pardon me. I'm feeling a mite
claustrophobic in there.

13:43.520 --> 13:46.000
Would it be terribly troublesome
 for me to open a window?

13:46.000 --> 13:50.000
Oh, why don't you step
outside for a minute?

13:58.560 --> 14:02.560
How dare you! Let go of me!

14:04.040 --> 14:06.960
  Would you please call security?

14:06.960 --> 14:10.960
Look at what you did.
I'm the one who's got to clean it up.

14:29.000 --> 14:29.880
     Can you hold that for me?

14:29.880 --> 14:33.880
Yes, ma'am.

14:36.040 --> 14:38.600
Oh darn, I forgot to write
something on a patient's chart.

14:38.600 --> 14:39.920
Never mind, I'll catch the next one.

14:39.920 --> 14:43.920
OK, OK. Hubba hubba!

14:44.800 --> 14:48.800
Wayne!

14:49.560 --> 14:51.680
Stand here and talk to me
for a second.

14:51.680 --> 14:52.480
What for?

14:52.480 --> 14:53.440
I'm waiting for someone.

14:53.440 --> 14:55.400
I want to ride in the elevator
  with Miss Teen Dream.

14:55.400 --> 14:56.040
Who?

14:56.040 --> 14:59.000
The dame, the respiratory therapist
who's not wearing any underwear.

14:59.000 --> 14:59.920
How can you tell?

14:59.920 --> 15:02.640
Believe me, I've done my homework.
Nadine Aurora lives in Quincy.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.600
Recently broke up with her RV
salesman boyfriend named Scott.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.560
Has a deep breathy voice,

15:06.560 --> 15:08.920
and a penchant for corny messages
on her answering machine.

15:08.920 --> 15:10.000
Have someone else...

15:10.000 --> 15:12.000
No, no, no, Wayne, buddy, come on.

15:12.000 --> 15:13.800
Stephen Craig's funeral is today.

15:13.800 --> 15:16.040
This should be a time
              for sober reflection.

15:16.040 --> 15:18.560
OK, absolutely, absolutely,
I agree with you.

15:18.560 --> 15:21.240
You know, there but for the grace
of God goes me, OK.

15:21.240 --> 15:22.400
My motto, carpe diem.

15:22.400 --> 15:25.320
My favourite fish. Look, I'm tired
of standing around

15:25.320 --> 15:29.160
and watching my friends degrade
themselves in empty carnal pursuits.

15:29.160 --> 15:31.240
Aren't we the disapproving
puritan all of a sudden!

15:31.240 --> 15:32.840
What are you?
   Boning up on Cotton Mather?

15:32.840 --> 15:35.280
No, I spent the weekend
watching Bobby Caldwell

15:35.280 --> 15:37.600
drench the bars on Cape Cod.

15:37.600 --> 15:40.040
Besides, she's wearing
too much eye shadow.

15:40.040 --> 15:44.040
Get a hold of yourself. Come on.

15:49.280 --> 15:50.880
Aha-ha.

15:50.880 --> 15:52.840
There we go.
Can I give you a hand with that?

15:52.840 --> 15:54.320
     No, I'm doing all right.

15:54.320 --> 15:56.560
OK. Hey, you know what,
   I was going to ride on down

15:56.560 --> 15:58.880
and get a cup of soup or something.
Care to join me?

15:58.880 --> 16:02.880
Why not? I could use something hot.

16:03.600 --> 16:07.320
I told you, I never wanted to see
you at this hospital again

16:07.320 --> 16:09.400
unless it was for a fundraiser.

16:09.400 --> 16:10.480
I was brought here against my will.

16:10.480 --> 16:14.480
You were brought here unconscious!

16:16.120 --> 16:18.760
       I was a little dizzy.

16:18.760 --> 16:20.400
You had another heart attack!

16:20.400 --> 16:22.080
That was ten days ago.

16:22.080 --> 16:23.800
I feel fine now.

16:23.800 --> 16:26.520
I didn't perform a triple bypass
 on you a year and a half ago

16:26.520 --> 16:28.000
because I needed the practice.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.960
That surgery gave you
a second chance,

16:29.960 --> 16:32.760
but you don't even care enough
  to look after yourself.

16:32.760 --> 16:34.360
    I'm the picture of health.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.720
When did you start smoking again?

16:35.720 --> 16:37.280
          I don't smoke.

16:37.280 --> 16:39.840
Your fingers are yellow,
and I can smell the tobacco!

16:39.840 --> 16:43.160
I just chew a little. Just a pinch
between my cheek and gum.

16:43.160 --> 16:44.520
KNOCK AT DOOR

16:44.520 --> 16:45.200
Who is it?

16:45.200 --> 16:49.200
Who is it?
Oliver London.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.920
Now, I want you to listen
to me, Mr Broadwater.

16:53.920 --> 16:55.920
Mark, I need to speak with you!

16:55.920 --> 16:57.080
Put it in a letter!

16:57.080 --> 16:58.560
This is important!

16:58.560 --> 17:01.520
If you're trying to scare up
   a quick golf game

17:01.520 --> 17:04.280
in between malpractice suits,
  forget it.

17:04.280 --> 17:06.440
Now, this may come as news to you,

17:06.440 --> 17:09.119
but the good Lord
gave you only one body.

17:09.119 --> 17:12.319
BANGING ON DOOR

17:12.319 --> 17:13.640
Oliver, can you hear me?

17:13.640 --> 17:14.720
Barely.

17:14.720 --> 17:17.240
Come closer, then.

17:17.240 --> 17:18.400
How's this?

17:18.400 --> 17:20.319
I can hear you fine.

17:20.319 --> 17:21.839
Oh!

17:21.839 --> 17:25.240
                            (COUGHS)

17:25.240 --> 17:29.000
Now, it's your responsibility
to take care of that body.

17:29.000 --> 17:33.000
Because once a life is over,
   there aren't any encores.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.360
These are my friends. Sonette.

17:43.360 --> 17:45.680
Muray. Farah.

17:45.680 --> 17:47.200
Farah's the same age as you.

17:47.200 --> 17:49.680
KNOCKING ON DOOR

17:49.680 --> 17:52.080
You work in the ugliest
building I've ever seen.

17:52.080 --> 17:54.040
Hello, Constance!

17:54.040 --> 17:58.040
Tommy, my God,
you've grown since last fall.

17:59.280 --> 18:00.800
 And we've both lost weight, huh?

18:00.800 --> 18:01.360
Ethiopia.

18:01.360 --> 18:02.520
Ethiopia.
             Pritikin.

18:02.520 --> 18:05.840
It's a hell of a lot safer,
but I didn't need a passport, huh?

18:05.840 --> 18:08.560
Unfortunately, now I need glasses
so I can see the improvement.

18:08.560 --> 18:11.280
You fight to stay skinny,
then go blind, so it doesn't matter!

18:11.280 --> 18:12.600
   Middle age is all trade-offs.

18:12.600 --> 18:13.640
Isn't it?

18:13.640 --> 18:14.480
Me?

18:14.480 --> 18:17.040
Me?
         Yeah, that's you.

18:17.040 --> 18:18.600
           Here's Lizzy.

18:18.600 --> 18:19.760
Constance, I really apologise

18:19.760 --> 18:21.840
for driving you away from the lake
this time of the year.

18:21.840 --> 18:23.880
But I need you, and I really
   appreciate you coming down.

18:23.880 --> 18:26.920
      Donald, you are all surprises.

18:26.920 --> 18:28.720
Quitting your job, going to Africa.

18:28.720 --> 18:30.960
Naming me executress of your estate.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.400
And a month later, you're back,
business as usual.

18:33.400 --> 18:34.840
I didn't think my life
      was that chaotic,

18:34.840 --> 18:35.840
but when you put it that way,

18:35.840 --> 18:37.440
I do sound kind of crazy, don't I?

18:37.440 --> 18:38.600
Don't you have a picture of Maureen?

18:38.600 --> 18:41.520
Not here, no.

18:41.520 --> 18:44.200
Here's a picture of me
and your mommy.

18:44.200 --> 18:46.880
            When we were in college.

18:46.880 --> 18:48.480
Oh, look at that.

18:48.480 --> 18:51.240
Kiss Me Kate. I saw every
performance of that at Emerson.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.680
Yeah, it took you till closing night
to ask her out, too.

18:53.680 --> 18:54.760
Well, I was intimidated.

18:54.760 --> 18:57.120
You're lucky you didn't lose her
to that guy that played Petruchio.

18:57.120 --> 18:58.160
                  What was his name?

18:58.160 --> 19:00.600
Um, Andy Kapatkin.

19:00.600 --> 19:02.480
An alto and a stiff.

19:02.480 --> 19:06.480
She had charisma.

19:08.720 --> 19:12.720
  She lived for hair and make-up.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.880
                              Tommy.

19:16.880 --> 19:19.320
      Are you ready to take me home?

19:19.320 --> 19:23.000
I'll be there in a couple of hours,
all right?

19:23.000 --> 19:27.000
I have a funeral to go to
this afternoon.

19:27.040 --> 19:28.320
        His?

19:28.320 --> 19:29.880
I'll stop by the house to change,
all right?

19:29.880 --> 19:31.680
Now you listen to your
    Aunt Constance, all right?

19:31.680 --> 19:34.560
Let's go now.

19:34.560 --> 19:36.800
Donald, I don't know
why you came back.

19:36.800 --> 19:40.800
Ethiopia can't be more
depressing than this place.

19:45.080 --> 19:46.920
Come on, man, my skull is leaking,

19:46.920 --> 19:48.920
and you know it.
      I can feel the crack.

19:48.920 --> 19:50.680
Look, Nick, the X-rays are negative.

19:50.680 --> 19:53.360
There's no fractures,
 there's no leaky skull, nothing.

19:53.360 --> 19:54.920
You can go home this afternoon.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.160
Big deal.

19:56.160 --> 19:58.440
One more joy, Helen.

19:58.440 --> 19:59.720
         Hi, remember me?

19:59.720 --> 20:01.400
No.

20:01.400 --> 20:03.320
My memory comes and it goes.

20:03.320 --> 20:06.440
   I found your lucky lens cap.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.640
Wow. I knew you'd find it, thanks.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.480
I thought you didn't remember?

20:10.480 --> 20:12.160
I was just joking, OK.

20:12.160 --> 20:13.880
   So it was your grandfather's?

20:13.880 --> 20:15.640
Yeah, he was a pretty good
    photographer.

20:15.640 --> 20:18.040
What kind of pictures
do you like to take?

20:18.040 --> 20:18.720
Besides nudes.

20:18.720 --> 20:20.960
Besides nudes.
Nah, if I told you what kind
of pictures I like to shoot,

20:20.960 --> 20:21.960
you'd think I was a wuss.

20:21.960 --> 20:22.760
No, we wouldn't.

20:22.760 --> 20:23.800
No, we wouldn't.
Promise.

20:23.800 --> 20:27.240
Flowers.

20:27.240 --> 20:28.400
See, wuss!

20:28.400 --> 20:30.360
I don't think so.

20:30.360 --> 20:31.520
&lt; Well, it doesn't matter
what you think,

20:31.520 --> 20:35.120
cos that's what everyone thinks.

20:35.120 --> 20:36.400
But that's going to change.

20:36.400 --> 20:38.200
Because you know what
I'm going to shoot next?

20:38.200 --> 20:42.200
I'm going to shoot a mook
    named Keith.

20:50.800 --> 20:53.280
I wanted to do
something with fabrics and colours.

20:53.280 --> 20:54.320
Very creative.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.840
But the bottom
dropped out of interior design

20:56.840 --> 20:58.400
        during the Arab oil embargo.

20:58.400 --> 21:01.760
So, I became a respiratory therapist
instead.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.720
Pretty fond of lungs myself.

21:03.720 --> 21:05.480
Hiya. Mind if I join you?

21:05.480 --> 21:06.840
Actually, Bob, we're
having a little tete-a-tete.

21:06.840 --> 21:07.880
                   Please, sit down.

21:07.880 --> 21:09.840
Like I said, the more, the merrier.

21:09.840 --> 21:12.120
Harvey Caldwell.

21:12.120 --> 21:13.480
                      Nadine Aurora.

21:13.480 --> 21:16.040
I know. I've admired you
from afar for quite some time.

21:16.040 --> 21:17.720
                     You have?

21:17.720 --> 21:19.520
It's been a long day. &gt;

21:19.520 --> 21:21.520
I just got out of surgery.

21:21.520 --> 21:22.600
              You're a surgeon, huh?

21:22.600 --> 21:23.640
Me too.

21:23.640 --> 21:26.960
I had a burn case. Air force major
they brought in from Otis.

21:26.960 --> 21:29.280
       The elevator people?

21:29.280 --> 21:32.720
His jet caught fire 50,000 feet.
Had to rebuild his face.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.800
      That is so interesting.

21:35.800 --> 21:38.360
Minor cosmetic work, really.

21:38.360 --> 21:41.520
Victor here, he's the one who's been
logging hours in the OR lately.

21:41.520 --> 21:42.880
I'll say. Just the other day,

21:42.880 --> 21:44.880
I resected a low sigmoid
     adenocarcinoma.

21:44.880 --> 21:48.440
I was able to anastomose
five centimetres of anal sphincter.

21:48.440 --> 21:50.520
Patient 75 years old,
with flatus,

21:50.520 --> 21:53.760
passing stools like he was a kid
 again.

21:53.760 --> 21:55.760
         You gave back a man's face.

21:55.760 --> 21:58.080
His identity.
The window to his soul.

21:58.080 --> 21:59.880
Yeah.

21:59.880 --> 22:01.560
     Were you in the OR a long time?

22:01.560 --> 22:02.600
Six and a half hours.

22:02.600 --> 22:04.480
                 Oh, you poor thing.

22:04.480 --> 22:06.320
              You must be exhausted.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.440
A stiff neck is all.

22:08.440 --> 22:10.880
Move your buns, Ehrlich,
you're late for rounds.

22:10.880 --> 22:12.880
I'll be right there, sir.
Nadine.

22:12.880 --> 22:15.120
I want you to know how
wonderful lunch has been.

22:15.120 --> 22:16.880
I'm hoping next time
it's going to be dinner.

22:16.880 --> 22:18.200
   It was fun. Thanks again, Walter.

22:18.200 --> 22:19.640
Victor.

22:19.640 --> 22:20.520
Ehrlich!

22:20.520 --> 22:23.680
Ehrlich!
Coming, sir. Bye.

22:23.680 --> 22:27.680
       I have healing hands.

22:31.640 --> 22:35.640
The camps can't feed everyone, so
the staff determines a cut-off point.

22:36.400 --> 22:40.200
In the case of the children,
it's 90 lbs.

22:40.200 --> 22:43.160
Families from the countryside
who weigh too much to be admitted

22:43.160 --> 22:44.280
       wait along the road,

22:44.280 --> 22:48.280
and they sit at the gates until they
lose enough weight to go inside.

22:53.960 --> 22:56.080
The staff is made up mostly
of Ethiopians,

22:56.080 --> 22:57.960
doing the bulk of the work
themselves.

22:57.960 --> 23:00.840
There's one doctor, two nurses,
a few medical assistants,

23:00.840 --> 23:04.840
sanitation workers, and 32
gravediggers, who work full-time.

23:11.280 --> 23:14.160
Been to hell and back, Donald.

23:14.160 --> 23:17.760
But I came back optimistic that
for the first time since Hiroshima,

23:17.760 --> 23:19.720
I really feel that life
on this planet

23:19.720 --> 23:22.000
doesn't have to end
in a nuclear fireball.

23:22.000 --> 23:25.480
When people unite in a common
purpose, we can accomplish anything.

23:25.480 --> 23:28.040
Now, these proposals here
are just the first step in the job

23:28.040 --> 23:29.120
     we can do here in Boston.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.240
Let's get down to specifics.

23:31.240 --> 23:33.960
This business about residents
doing community service.

23:33.960 --> 23:36.800
Nelson, there are people out
there who are just too poor

23:36.800 --> 23:39.400
or too scared or too ignorant
to come to St Eligius.

23:39.400 --> 23:41.920
Now, by sending our residents
out into the field,

23:41.920 --> 23:43.760
we provide a badly-needed service,

23:43.760 --> 23:46.680
and at the same time, we expand the
medical education of our students.

23:46.680 --> 23:49.000
Who's going to guarantee the
safety of our people?

23:49.000 --> 23:52.000
It's bad enough driving, let alone
traipsing through tenements.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.000
Nelson has a point. I mean,
it's a question of liability.

23:55.000 --> 23:56.720
We could be setting ourselves up
   for one hell of a loss.

23:56.720 --> 23:58.200
Let's table this for now.

23:58.200 --> 24:02.200
These hospital sponsored courses
 for low-budget nutrition

24:02.520 --> 24:04.160
are an excellent idea.

24:04.160 --> 24:07.120
Ladies and gentlemen, we
get five or six cases of malnutrition

24:07.120 --> 24:09.360
in this hospital every week,
mostly children.

24:09.360 --> 24:11.040
Now, their parents get food
stamps but they don't know

24:11.040 --> 24:13.960
what a healthy diet is. And we
have dieticians on our staff...

24:13.960 --> 24:15.920
what a healthy diet is. And we
have dieticians on our staff...
                      Wait a second!

24:15.920 --> 24:19.280
Teaching people the difference
between marshmallow toasties

24:19.280 --> 24:21.320
and granola isn't the job
    of a hospital.

24:21.320 --> 24:23.360
Well, I don't understand why
a teaching hospital

24:23.360 --> 24:24.560
    can't instruct its patients

24:24.560 --> 24:26.440
at the same time it's teaching
its residents.

24:26.440 --> 24:28.360
That's not what our charter
   empowers us to do.

24:28.360 --> 24:31.240
Well, maybe it's time
we redefined our responsibility.

24:31.240 --> 24:33.880
Want to know what defines
    a hospital?

24:33.880 --> 24:36.320
Economics. Now, we don't
have the money in the budget.

24:36.320 --> 24:38.640
We can't be all things
      to all people.

24:38.640 --> 24:41.480
There are other agencies
to deal with the indigent. &gt;

24:41.480 --> 24:42.680
They're not doing enough, damn it!

24:42.680 --> 24:44.160
Donald, what you have suggested

24:44.160 --> 24:46.480
is a radical shift in
   the policy of this hospital.

24:46.480 --> 24:48.000
I move we sub-committee this agenda,

24:48.000 --> 24:49.800
take it up next month
     at our regular meeting.

24:49.800 --> 24:52.880
Second.

24:52.880 --> 24:56.880
What the hell's eating him?

24:59.280 --> 25:00.480
Donald...

25:00.480 --> 25:03.160
I expected more support
from you in there.

25:03.160 --> 25:05.760
Unfortunately, I couldn't argue
      with Nelson's logic.

25:05.760 --> 25:08.080
Where's your money gonna come from?

25:08.080 --> 25:10.240
All we have to do is sell
one piece of hi-tech machinery,

25:10.240 --> 25:11.840
    the CAT scan, for instance.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.320
Are you crazy? I spent years
struggling to get that equipment.

25:14.320 --> 25:17.520
That's all it is. Equipment. We could
feed 100 families with that money.

25:17.520 --> 25:21.320
We can't just break up the
place and sell it for spare parts.

25:21.320 --> 25:23.680
What's the use of having a machine
that looks inside somebody's body

25:23.680 --> 25:24.720
if there's no food in their stomach?

25:24.720 --> 25:26.720
if there's no food in their stomach?
I'm not selling the CAT scan!

25:26.720 --> 25:29.960
  That's fine. Fine, fine, fine.

25:29.960 --> 25:31.240
But...

25:31.240 --> 25:33.720
I will unload the argon laser.

25:33.720 --> 25:37.720
         Attaboy, Daniel!

25:42.360 --> 25:45.080
What make you so sure Nick
doesn't mean what he says?

25:45.080 --> 25:47.320
He's just some punk kid
running off at the mouth.

25:47.320 --> 25:49.520
No, I have kids, I know the signs.

25:49.520 --> 25:51.880
The look in his eyes,
tone in his voice - he's angry.

25:51.880 --> 25:54.760
Look, every patient has the right
    to expect confidentiality

25:54.760 --> 25:57.160
from his doctors and nurses.
  I learned that the hard way.

25:57.160 --> 26:01.160
I ruined a marriage between
a man and three women because
 I couldn't keep my mouth shut.

26:01.560 --> 26:02.960
  So now you look the other way?

26:02.960 --> 26:06.080
I'm not prepared to violate
a confidence that may land Nick
            in jail.

26:06.080 --> 26:07.800
Phil, you wanna  give me a hand?

26:07.800 --> 26:10.880
Look, the kid doesn't have
anybody else looking out for him.

26:10.880 --> 26:13.320
Why don't you give him
a psychiatric referral?

26:13.320 --> 26:15.200
Are you telling me how
to treat my patient?

26:15.200 --> 26:18.160
No, I'm asking you to get a second
opinion on his emotional state.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.720
Phil, some time today, maybe?

26:19.720 --> 26:23.440
Coming. Look, Helen, when you
go back to school and get your MD,

26:23.440 --> 26:25.680
then I'll listen  to your
    professional assessments.

26:25.680 --> 26:29.680
But until that time, you're just
gonna have to live with mine.

26:33.200 --> 26:37.200
I think you're right, Marci. I don't
think we should see each other
until we reach our ideal weight.

26:38.000 --> 26:40.040
I just want to tell you I'm sorry.

26:40.040 --> 26:43.920
My jokes about you being tubby only
 compound your  low self-esteem.

26:43.920 --> 26:47.160
Very funny.
I'll talk to you later, bye.

26:47.160 --> 26:48.600
    Now, what were you saying?

26:48.600 --> 26:50.640
You see, I know what it's like
to be discriminated against.

26:50.640 --> 26:51.960
           I suppose so.

26:51.960 --> 26:55.880
I was the only kid in  my gym class
   who hadn't reached puberty.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.640
I was a late bloomer.

26:57.640 --> 27:00.600
Poor guy, and here I was teasing
you about your height. I'm sorry.

27:00.600 --> 27:02.440
Well, you see,
I can't do nothing about my height,

27:02.440 --> 27:05.240
but you can do something about
your weight - if you want to.

27:05.240 --> 27:06.560
            Like what?

27:06.560 --> 27:10.080
Why don't you join some kind
of support group or something?

27:10.080 --> 27:13.400
Oh, I got it! Why
don't you get a personal trainer?

27:13.400 --> 27:15.040
             Who?  Me.

27:15.040 --> 27:16.720
             How much?

27:16.720 --> 27:18.480
No charge.

27:18.480 --> 27:21.560
    You'd do that for me? Why?

27:21.560 --> 27:23.640
Cos I'm like Michelangelo.

27:23.640 --> 27:27.200
Every block of marble
has a David inside.

27:27.200 --> 27:28.480
              Really?

27:28.480 --> 27:32.480
          How about this?

27:32.480 --> 27:36.480
         Where you going?

27:38.520 --> 27:42.520
Doctor.

28:06.840 --> 28:09.080
The drawer gets stuck halfway out.

28:09.080 --> 28:10.160
Gets stuck?

28:10.160 --> 28:11.680
               Yes.

28:11.680 --> 28:13.800
             You see?

28:13.800 --> 28:15.680
Daniel, I have to talk to you.

28:15.680 --> 28:17.240
Top drawer get stuck, huh?

28:17.240 --> 28:21.240
          That's correct.

28:22.560 --> 28:24.480
Top drawer?

28:24.480 --> 28:28.360
Please, take it down to
maintenance and get it fixed.

28:28.360 --> 28:32.360
I'm gonna need some help.
Let me go get Carl.

28:34.520 --> 28:37.280
You know what saves me from having a
fit of apoplexy?

28:37.280 --> 28:41.280
The knowledge that that man's pay
is a charitable contribution.

28:41.440 --> 28:44.040
Daniel, there's a boy in this
      hospital, Nick Meose,

28:44.040 --> 28:46.800
he's about to leave. And I'm  afraid
 that he's gonna hurt somebody,

28:46.800 --> 28:49.240
or hurt himself, and  I think
    one of the psychiatrists

28:49.240 --> 28:49.320
should see him as soon as possible.

28:49.320 --> 28:52.120
should see him as soon as possible.
         Who's his doctor?

28:52.120 --> 28:55.360
It's Phil Chandler, and he and I
  don't see  eye to eye on this.

28:55.360 --> 28:56.880
Phil has had basic training
in psychiatry.

28:56.880 --> 29:00.520
If he doesn't feel a consult is
warranted, I trust his judgement.

29:00.520 --> 29:03.280
Well, I may not have
    his academic background,

29:03.280 --> 29:06.360
but I have spent a lot of years on
the ward and I know  when somebody's
         about to snap!

29:06.360 --> 29:09.720
I'll review the case with
Phil after today's rounds.

29:09.720 --> 29:12.880
You can read  your reports, but I'm
in ER trying to stop the bleeding,

29:12.880 --> 29:16.880
and somebody had better talk to
this kid before it comes to that.

29:16.920 --> 29:19.640
Oh, God!

29:19.640 --> 29:21.720
OK, I've got Carl here.

29:21.720 --> 29:23.040
OK, I've got Carl here.
What's the problem?

29:23.040 --> 29:27.040
Well, the top drawer gets stuck.

29:29.680 --> 29:33.160
Top drawer gets stuck, huh?

29:33.160 --> 29:37.160
CRYING

29:42.000 --> 29:46.000
Why aren't my granddaughter's
progress reports on my desk?

29:46.320 --> 29:47.320
I don't know.

29:47.320 --> 29:48.480
I don't know.
         Well, you should.

29:48.480 --> 29:50.240
She's not my patient.

29:50.240 --> 29:53.080
You just deliver these kids and leave
them on somebody else's doorstep?

29:53.080 --> 29:56.680
I came up to see how she's doing.
Get me baby Craig's chart.

29:56.680 --> 29:57.240
             Barbara.

29:57.240 --> 29:59.360
             Barbara.
You are gorgeous! Yes you are!

29:59.360 --> 30:03.360
And catching a chill, for Pete's
sake. Here, I'm gonna do that.

30:06.920 --> 30:09.840
Didn't anybody ever teach
you how to give a baby a bath?

30:09.840 --> 30:13.480
       This water is tepid.

30:13.480 --> 30:17.480
If Barbara had teeth,
they would be chattering now.

30:18.760 --> 30:22.760
There we go. Now, the baby has
to be put in the water very slowly.

30:24.080 --> 30:28.080
Cradle her gently,
but firmly so she feels safe.

30:28.680 --> 30:32.680
And we allow her to
get used to the water.

30:33.880 --> 30:36.400
               Soap.

30:36.400 --> 30:40.400
Rub-a-dub-dub!
This is like the Navy, huh?

30:40.720 --> 30:43.360
He's moving her out of there.

30:43.360 --> 30:46.200
That's terrific.
Congratulations, Barbara.

30:46.200 --> 30:49.480
      It's a big day for you.

30:49.480 --> 30:52.040
Any change in your
daughter-in-law's condition?

30:52.040 --> 30:53.680
      She's still in a coma.

30:53.680 --> 30:57.240
       Brain stem contusion.

30:57.240 --> 30:59.840
This is no way for you to
come into the world, Barbara.

30:59.840 --> 31:03.840
Without parents to love you,
care for you.

31:03.920 --> 31:06.400
           Yes. Mmm-hmm.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.840
Next time, put that
under a heating pad.

31:08.840 --> 31:12.000
That way the towel is warm and
very comforting for the baby.

31:12.000 --> 31:16.000
Yes, sweetheart, yes.
Here we go. Mmm-hmm.

31:16.720 --> 31:20.720
          That's a girl.

31:22.400 --> 31:26.400
     Right. I have to go home.

31:33.960 --> 31:37.960
Watch the phones.
Going into dry dock for repairs.

31:44.280 --> 31:48.280
SNIGGERING

31:49.680 --> 31:52.440
&lt; I never thought
I'd get that tattoo.

31:52.440 --> 31:56.440
&lt; I want one.

31:58.680 --> 32:02.680
&lt; Tomorrow, you're gonna bring in
bowling balls and a rubber band.
Do you understand?

32:04.000 --> 32:06.920
&lt; Yes, sir!

32:06.920 --> 32:10.920
There. Capital T stands for Tommy,
top and Toto, too.

32:11.840 --> 32:15.240
   Now, you take a crack at it.

32:15.240 --> 32:19.040
I know you can do it.
You know you can do it.

32:19.040 --> 32:20.680
   One block on top of another,

32:20.680 --> 32:24.400
and before you know it
you've built a castle.

32:24.400 --> 32:25.440
Hi.

32:25.440 --> 32:27.600
 Wasn't expecting you till later.

32:27.600 --> 32:31.000
The board of trustees stalled
my community outreach proposals.

32:31.000 --> 32:32.920
       You want a drink?  No.

32:32.920 --> 32:36.920
THUNDER

32:42.800 --> 32:45.440
17 years of drought -

32:45.440 --> 32:49.440
Profits, profits, profits.
Boston, Detroit.

32:50.320 --> 32:53.920
All those poor,
diseased, dying people.

32:53.920 --> 32:57.920
The only differences
are  the resources and the apathy
   of those who control them.

32:58.960 --> 33:00.720
You know how selfish we are?

33:00.720 --> 33:04.720
We're a nation of card-carrying
neurotics more interested in tax
            loopholes

33:05.360 --> 33:08.080
than we are with
helping our fellow man.

33:08.080 --> 33:12.080
I've seen Ethiopians die with more
dignity than some Americans live.

33:12.680 --> 33:15.240
And I promised myself I was
gonna try to change that.

33:15.240 --> 33:18.640
Donald, you come down off the
mountain sounding like Moses

33:18.640 --> 33:21.080
and expect the whole world to
fall in step behind you.

33:21.080 --> 33:25.080
It doesn't work that way. You did
the same thing when Marine died.

33:25.360 --> 33:28.280
Oh, please, Constance. I just
went 15 rounds at the hospital.

33:28.280 --> 33:29.880
        That damn hospital!

33:29.880 --> 33:32.960
You and I were doing the vigil,
Tommy was a baby,

33:32.960 --> 33:36.960
Lizzy barely knew what was happening
except that her mother
was on those horrible machines.

33:38.000 --> 33:42.000
The kids and I went around the corner
for ice-cream, we came back
and it was over.

33:42.760 --> 33:45.600
You'd told them to pull the
plug on my sister's life.

33:45.600 --> 33:47.920
I did what I thought was right.

33:47.920 --> 33:51.920
And expected me to forgive you.
You wouldn't share the burden
of that decision with anyone,

33:52.240 --> 33:54.360
  because you had to be a martyr.

33:54.360 --> 33:57.160
You won't let anyone help
you bring up the kids,

33:57.160 --> 33:58.400
you wanna do that by yourself, too.

33:58.400 --> 34:02.400
Now you're getting kicked around
because you want to solve
the world's problems.

34:03.040 --> 34:07.040
What's in it for you,
Donald, besides punishment?

34:17.520 --> 34:20.040
                Oh!

34:20.040 --> 34:24.040
      I knew you could do it!

34:29.000 --> 34:30.719
       Tell you what, Rudi,

34:30.719 --> 34:34.199
I'll give you a chance
to win back some of your money.

34:34.199 --> 34:38.199
How are you, Keith?

34:40.360 --> 34:41.920
Now, say you're sorry.

34:41.920 --> 34:43.679
Now, say you're sorry.
I'm sorry.

34:43.679 --> 34:47.120
That was very good, Keith.

34:47.120 --> 34:51.120
Now, bark like a dog.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.640
I just looked in on
Caldwell's burn patient, 3311.

35:06.640 --> 35:10.080
He's haemorrhaging under the
skin graft. Have you seen Bobby?

35:10.080 --> 35:12.880
You know, he's not answering
his beeper. Should we page him?

35:12.880 --> 35:16.880
          With pleasure.

35:18.560 --> 35:20.240
(MOANS) Oh, Bobby!

35:20.240 --> 35:22.760
(MOANS) Oh, Bobby!
(TANNOY) Dr Robert Caldwell,
third floor nurses' station.

35:22.760 --> 35:25.040
Bobby?!

35:25.040 --> 35:27.600
Gotta go.  Just like that?

35:27.600 --> 35:30.600
I'm being paged!  So?!

35:30.600 --> 35:33.520
I told you - I'm on call.

35:33.520 --> 35:37.520
Oh...

35:39.920 --> 35:41.960
Somebody took our clothes!

35:41.960 --> 35:44.520
Multiple superficial pellet
wounds to the right shoulder!

35:44.520 --> 35:47.280
         Extremity intact.

35:47.280 --> 35:50.120
There's another one coming
in behind us! Head trauma.

35:50.120 --> 35:52.240
The scum better be dead or
I'll finish the job myself.

35:52.240 --> 35:53.720
Knock it off.

35:53.720 --> 35:55.360
      BP's 126/80, pulse 96.

35:55.360 --> 35:57.920
OK, start a line.
Crid type and cross for two.

35:57.920 --> 36:01.760
Helen, I need ringers.
Will you take this guy?

36:01.760 --> 36:04.840
A real mess! Severe crushing
to the left side of the skull.

36:04.840 --> 36:07.440
Obvious open cranium with
exposed brain tissue.

36:07.440 --> 36:09.520
Don't intubate.

36:09.520 --> 36:12.320
Ask the cops about next of kin.

36:12.320 --> 36:16.320
Ask the cops about next of kin.
    He doesn't have any family.

36:21.200 --> 36:23.240
We've been searching
high and low for you!

36:23.240 --> 36:27.240
Ehrlich, you are a dead man!
I want my scrubs now!

36:30.040 --> 36:33.160
Oh, you know, you don't look
half bad without your clothes on.

36:33.160 --> 36:36.000
Oh, but I'd wax my back,
if I were you.

36:36.000 --> 36:39.240
Your, er, fly boy's got some
bleeding at the surgical site.

36:39.240 --> 36:42.840
Nothing serious,
but I didn't want to damage
 the graft by applying pressure.

36:42.840 --> 36:44.360
Aren't you gonna ask him?  Huh?

36:44.360 --> 36:46.360
Aren't you gonna ask him?  Huh?
Oh, yeah!

36:46.360 --> 36:49.160
Lucy and I figured out
about the rubber bands, but...

36:49.160 --> 36:53.160
what are you gonna do with
the bowling ball?! Huh?!

36:53.680 --> 36:56.120
 "Your body needs food for energy.

36:56.120 --> 36:59.160
"But if you eat more
than you expend in energy,

36:59.160 --> 37:03.160
"your body stores
the surplus in the form of fat.

37:03.400 --> 37:06.400
"When the amount of fat
becomes excessive or unsightly,

37:06.400 --> 37:10.200
    "you are considered obese."

37:10.200 --> 37:14.200
Ugh!

37:15.080 --> 37:18.560
(PANTS) You know,
my father used to call me "Squirt".

37:18.560 --> 37:22.000
One day, he came to me and he said,
"Ever been to Hershey, Squirt?"

37:22.000 --> 37:24.800
Best vacation I ever had!

37:24.800 --> 37:28.800
The whole town smelt like chocolate.
My mom and dad used to take me
   on a  lot of themed vacations.

37:30.000 --> 37:32.000
Wisconsin for the cheese.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.640
Vermont for the maple syrup.

37:33.640 --> 37:35.400
Idaho for the potatoes.

37:35.400 --> 37:38.360
But the best vacation I ever had -
Hershey, Pennsylvania.

37:38.360 --> 37:40.840
      OK, all right. 20 more.

37:40.840 --> 37:43.080
Everybody there used to make
chocolate, with and without nuts.

37:43.080 --> 37:44.560
Everybody there used to make
chocolate, with and without nuts.
           Start rowing.

37:44.560 --> 37:47.960
I can't do this any more!
I'm exhausted, I'm drained!

37:47.960 --> 37:49.720
            You're fat!

37:49.720 --> 37:52.480
"Fat" is a relative term.
Compared to some people, I'm svelte!

37:52.480 --> 37:56.480
Humpy dumpy, maybe!
Now, start rowing!

37:58.280 --> 38:02.280
              One...

38:04.840 --> 38:08.840
              Helen?

38:15.280 --> 38:19.280
I heard about Nick Meose, um...
I'm very sorry I didn't listen.

38:21.400 --> 38:25.400
I'm sitting here trying to remember
why I wanted to get  transferred
          to emergency.

38:27.440 --> 38:31.440
A teenage boy...and a friend of
 mine's son  die and I stand by?!

38:33.520 --> 38:34.920
    You're a good nurse, Helen.

38:34.920 --> 38:36.760
    You're a good nurse, Helen.
Oh, I know that!

38:36.760 --> 38:40.760
Why they hell did I ever want to
become one in the first place?!

38:40.920 --> 38:44.920
I'm going to see the head of
nursing, get transferred upstairs.

38:47.160 --> 38:49.480
Let someone else cry for Nick Meose.

38:49.480 --> 38:53.480
I don't have the heart any more.

38:55.600 --> 38:59.600
THUNDER

38:59.840 --> 39:03.520
How many people are you
expecting at the funeral?

39:03.520 --> 39:06.120
I don't know, Mark.

39:06.120 --> 39:10.040
I bet they'll be dropping
back here for calling hours.

39:10.040 --> 39:13.880
Making a mess of the downstairs.
The caterers will clear it all up.

39:13.880 --> 39:16.880
Well, they better.
I've seen what they charge.

39:16.880 --> 39:20.880
Why do we keep using those
clods anyway?

39:22.680 --> 39:26.600
      Had to rain, didn't it?

39:26.600 --> 39:30.600
I never could get
this damn thing straight!

39:30.720 --> 39:34.720
Zip me up, please.

39:39.360 --> 39:41.080
      You know, it's lucky...

39:41.080 --> 39:43.240
I called the limousine
about directions.

39:43.240 --> 39:47.240
That driver thought
we lived in Newton.

39:49.280 --> 39:53.280
   He should be here any minute.

39:54.480 --> 39:58.480
I forgot to ask Reverend Ives
if he'd be reading from the King
James version.

39:59.120 --> 40:00.240
Damn it, Mark!

40:00.240 --> 40:03.800
We're saying goodbye
    to Stephen this afternoon

40:03.800 --> 40:05.960
and all you think about
       is trivial things!

40:05.960 --> 40:08.160
I want to make sure
the protocol is right.

40:08.160 --> 40:11.200
We are burying our son!

40:11.200 --> 40:13.000
       It's just a ceremony.

40:13.000 --> 40:15.480
       It's just a ceremony.
No, it's not!

40:15.480 --> 40:18.120
We're putting Stephen in a hole
in the ground and covering him up!

40:18.120 --> 40:19.920
     Don't be macabre, Ellen!

40:19.920 --> 40:23.360
Well, it is macabre, Mark!
Only you won't face it.

40:23.360 --> 40:26.480
And I don't how to.

40:26.480 --> 40:28.120
Well, the Valium's not gonna help.

40:28.120 --> 40:29.440
You have to have a clear
head to deal with this!

40:29.440 --> 40:32.800
I don't want to remember today,
I just want to get through it!

40:32.800 --> 40:34.680
   That's a bad attitude, Ellen.

40:34.680 --> 40:38.680
Well, I need the crutch,
because you've been no help to me
        at all in this!

40:48.280 --> 40:52.200
               Yeah?

40:52.200 --> 40:54.720
Look what Tommy gave me.

40:54.720 --> 40:55.840
               Oh...

40:55.840 --> 40:59.840
He used to draw with only one colour.
Now he's using the rest of the
crayons, too. That's great.

41:00.960 --> 41:04.960
He's much happier now.  Taking him
out of family care was a good move.

41:08.080 --> 41:11.080
Listen, Donald, I'm sorry
about what I said downstairs.

41:11.080 --> 41:13.080
   No, you're not. You meant it.

41:13.080 --> 41:17.080
Yeah, but I feel bad.
You didn't deserve a lecture.

41:17.800 --> 41:20.640
You know, you remind
me of Maureen sometimes?

41:20.640 --> 41:22.360
You know, you remind
me of Maureen sometimes?
Because she was opinionated?

41:22.360 --> 41:26.120
Yeah. How long are you
gonna stay with us?

41:26.120 --> 41:30.120
It'll take a couple of weeks
to help you get settled,
help you interview housekeepers.

41:31.200 --> 41:32.000
 Well, I wish it could be longer.

41:32.000 --> 41:33.600
 Well, I wish it could be longer.
Thanks.

41:33.600 --> 41:36.400
Mommy!

41:36.400 --> 41:40.400
Weird.

42:10.280 --> 42:13.320
              Ellen?

42:13.320 --> 42:17.320
             Let's go.

42:17.320 --> 42:20.720
I can't, Mark.

42:20.720 --> 42:24.720
        People are waiting.

42:25.200 --> 42:29.200
I can't go up there.

42:43.600 --> 42:46.880
        It'll be OK, Ellen.

42:46.880 --> 42:49.760
     We'll get through this...

42:49.760 --> 42:53.760
            ..together.

43:00.080 --> 44:00.000
    We don't want the umbrella.
