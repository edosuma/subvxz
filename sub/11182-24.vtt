(WHISTLING)

01:11.872 --> 01:13.774
Can you believe all that
snow coming down?

01:13.841 --> 01:15.676
Well, I ain't never seen
snow going up.

01:18.512 --> 01:20.581
-Be right back.
-Where you going?

01:20.648 --> 01:22.750
-Down to the store.
-But I thought you closed up
because of the snow?

01:22.816 --> 01:24.585
Yeah, I did, but I gotta
get something out of the safe.

01:24.652 --> 01:26.887
-I got a little surprise
for Weezy.
-A surprise?

01:26.954 --> 01:29.357
Yeah. Tomorrow
is the anniversary
of our first date.

01:29.423 --> 01:31.259
And you know,
Weezy paid for that date.

01:31.325 --> 01:35.028
And she been paying for it
ever since.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.331
And she gets mad at me
every year,
'cause I always forget.

01:37.398 --> 01:40.033
But this year's gonna be
different, because at midnight

01:40.100 --> 01:41.835
I got a special surprise
for Weez.

01:41.902 --> 01:44.238
What you gonna do?
Turn into a handsome prince?

01:46.140 --> 01:48.209
No. I'm gonna give her
a diamond necklace.

01:48.276 --> 01:49.843
-A diamond necklace?
-Yeah.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.979
-Real diamonds?
-That's right. You know
what they always say.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.814
Diamonds are a girl's
best friend.

01:53.881 --> 01:55.983
Well, in my case,
they ain't even
an acquaintance.

01:58.286 --> 02:01.155
Oh, it's terrible out there.

02:01.222 --> 02:04.425
-We even had to close
the Help Center.
-Uh!

02:04.492 --> 02:06.660
Weezy, I'll be back
in a minute. I gotta run down
to the store.

02:06.727 --> 02:08.862
Oh, you better wear a
warmer coat.

02:08.929 --> 02:10.231
Yeah, well, I would wear
your mink,

02:10.298 --> 02:12.933
but the cops might pick me up.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.336
Well, George,
it's barely above zero.

02:15.403 --> 02:18.172
Ain't that a blip?
The temperature matches
my paycheck.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.578
And your I.Q.

02:25.779 --> 02:28.449
-Well, hello, Mr. J.
-Hi, Bentley.

02:28.516 --> 02:31.051
Bye, Bentley.

02:31.118 --> 02:32.953
You know,
that's the first time
I've seen your door

02:33.020 --> 02:34.555
slam from this side.

02:36.089 --> 02:38.726
-Can I help you, Mr. Bentley?
-Oh yes,

02:38.792 --> 02:41.329
you see I'm having a problem
with my budgie.

02:42.230 --> 02:43.797
Pardon?

02:43.864 --> 02:47.901
Uh, with my parakeet, Chester.
I'm afraid
he's catching a cold.

02:47.968 --> 02:50.804
How can you tell?
Has he been blowing his
beak a lot?

02:53.841 --> 02:55.743
Uh, sorry.

02:55.809 --> 02:57.878
I was wondering if I could
warm him up over here.

02:57.945 --> 03:00.080
You see, the heat's not
working in my apartment.

03:00.147 --> 03:01.749
Oh no.

03:01.815 --> 03:04.752
Yes. And I'm afraid that's why
Chester's been acting
so sluggish.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.720
He hasn't said a word all day.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.557
-(DOORBELL RINGS)
-Oh, I didn't know your bird
could talk.

03:09.623 --> 03:13.561
Oh yes, I've already trained
him to say "thank you"
and "you're welcome."

03:13.627 --> 03:15.195
Really?

03:15.263 --> 03:18.031
Maybe you should
come over here
and train George.

03:20.368 --> 03:22.403
-Oh, hi, Tom, Helen. Come in.
-Hello.

03:22.470 --> 03:25.406
-Louise, guess what?
-Your heat's out.

03:25.473 --> 03:27.941
No, our...
How did you know that?

03:28.008 --> 03:29.877
Because my heat's out, too.

03:29.943 --> 03:31.579
-Oh, hi, Mr. Bentley.
-Hello.

03:31.645 --> 03:33.180
Did anybody call maintenance?

03:33.247 --> 03:37.217
-Yes, I did.
-And you should have heard
what she called them.

03:37.285 --> 03:39.887
Ralph said there might be
a whole line of
apartments out.

03:39.953 --> 03:42.155
He's trying to get
someone to fix it now.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.858
-(DOORBELL RINGS)
-Oh. Well why don't you
stay here until they fix it?

03:44.925 --> 03:47.495
Oh, thank you, Louise.
We'd love to.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.663
-Hello, Mrs. Jefferson, ma'am.
-Hello, Ralph.

03:49.730 --> 03:51.465
-Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Willis.
Mr. Bentley.
-Hi, Ralph.

03:51.532 --> 03:54.001
Ralph, have you talked to
someone about the heating?

03:54.067 --> 03:57.471
Oh yes, sir, Mr. Willis.
Yes, sir.
And that's why I'm here.

03:57.538 --> 03:59.707
It wasn't easy
getting through to them,

03:59.773 --> 04:03.511
but I neglected all of my
other duties just to contact
the heating company

04:03.577 --> 04:04.912
for you, Mr. Willis.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.316
Thanks, Ralph.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.552
Bravo, Ralph.

04:11.619 --> 04:13.020
Yes, sir, Mr. Bentley.

04:13.086 --> 04:15.389
And once I got through to
the company it wasn't easy

04:15.456 --> 04:16.957
getting them to listen to me.

04:17.024 --> 04:20.060
But I told them you were
a very important man, sir,

04:20.127 --> 04:21.929
working for the U.N.
and all, sir.

04:23.664 --> 04:24.932
Thank you, Ralph.

04:26.133 --> 04:28.969
Maybe I should be telling
this to Mr. Jefferson.

04:29.036 --> 04:30.871
Uh, Ralph,
what about the heat?

04:30.938 --> 04:35.376
Oh yes, ma'am. I finally
told them it was a matter
of life and death.

04:35.443 --> 04:38.479
And they said
they'd treat it as an
emergency rush job.

04:38.546 --> 04:39.780
Oh, that's good.

04:39.847 --> 04:42.683
They're gonna send one
over the day after tomorrow.

04:42.750 --> 04:44.017
The day after tomorrow?

04:44.084 --> 04:46.387
I tried, Mr. Willis.
I'm sorry.

04:46.454 --> 04:48.822
I wish there was
something else I could do.

04:48.889 --> 04:52.526
I'd suggest a hotel,
but it's impossible to
get to one in all this snow.

04:52.593 --> 04:55.696
Oh, it's not your fault,
Ralph.
Thanks for your trouble.

04:55.763 --> 04:59.032
Yes, sir.
Just doing my job, sir.

05:01.201 --> 05:03.036
Oh.

05:10.077 --> 05:11.078
Here, Ralph.

05:12.913 --> 05:15.983
And an important job
it is, sir.

05:16.049 --> 05:17.651
Then you better go do it,
Ralph.

05:17.718 --> 05:20.253
Yes, ma'am.
I'll get right back on it.

05:21.655 --> 05:23.190
I must be losing my touch.

05:25.359 --> 05:28.161
Well, I'm afraid we're in
for a cold night.

05:28.228 --> 05:31.632
-Oh, don't worry.
You can all stay here.
-Here?

05:31.699 --> 05:32.800
Sure. Why not?

05:34.101 --> 05:35.669
Well, there's one reason.

05:37.237 --> 05:39.407
Oh, George won't mind.

05:39.473 --> 05:40.908
Won't mind what?

05:40.974 --> 05:43.010
Well, Mr. Bentley
and the Willises
don't have any heat.

05:43.076 --> 05:45.112
So I invited them to stay
here tonight.

05:45.178 --> 05:48.181
Stay here?
Where the hell is
everybody gonna sleep?

05:48.248 --> 05:49.783
Well, Alan's in Vermont.

05:49.850 --> 05:52.285
Well, why don't they go
sleep with him up there?

05:52.352 --> 05:54.054
Oh, he's so cute.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.391
You two can use Alan's room,

05:57.458 --> 05:59.292
and Mr. Bentley
can sleep on the couch.

05:59.359 --> 06:02.229
Oh, why don't we have a
pajama party?

06:02.295 --> 06:04.331
(CHUCKLING)

06:04.398 --> 06:06.867
Splendid idea.
And we can hold it here
in my room.

06:13.541 --> 06:17.210
I got a better idea.
You can hold it
in your apartment.

06:17.277 --> 06:20.781
Oh, come on, George.
A pajama party sounds
like fun, doesn't it?

06:20.848 --> 06:23.150
No.

06:23.216 --> 06:27.054
Well, I have a whole
chicken in the refrigerator,
I'll bring it down.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.356
Helen, you don't have to
do that.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.759
Right.
You already brought down
a big turkey.

06:34.562 --> 06:38.098
And I have a bottle of
champagne I've been saving
for a special occasion.

06:38.165 --> 06:40.668
Great. Let's go, Helen,
I'll help you bring
some stuff down.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.803
Weezy, I don't think this
is gonna work.

06:42.870 --> 06:45.473
Oh, come on, George,
it'll be fun.

06:49.610 --> 06:51.178
What's going on out here?

06:51.244 --> 06:53.346
Bentley and the Willises
ain't got no heat
in their apartments,

06:53.413 --> 06:55.583
so Weezy invited them
down here to spend
the night with us.

06:55.649 --> 06:57.818
Well, look on the bright side.

06:57.885 --> 07:00.053
Now you'll have an audience
when you give Miss Jefferson
her big surprise.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.622
Huh?

07:01.689 --> 07:03.356
-Yeah.
-They're all gonna see
them big diamonds you got her.

07:03.423 --> 07:05.192
Oh yeah, that's right.

07:05.258 --> 07:08.128
They'll all see what a sweet,
wonderful, generous person
I am.

07:08.195 --> 07:09.663
Yeah, you'll fool them all.

07:15.302 --> 07:17.337
You know, Louise,
I'm kind of glad

07:17.404 --> 07:19.006
the heat in our apartment
went out.

07:19.072 --> 07:20.073
(ALL LAUGHING)

07:20.140 --> 07:21.775
I know what you mean, Helen.

07:21.842 --> 07:24.512
It's nice to spend an
entire evening
with good friends.

07:24.578 --> 07:26.947
Yeah. I wish some of my
good friends were here.

07:29.550 --> 07:31.519
(LAUGHING)

07:31.585 --> 07:33.186
Just kidding, Willis.
I know we're all gonna
have a good time.

07:33.253 --> 07:36.389
-Yeah.
-It's just what every
pajama party needs.

07:36.456 --> 07:38.191
-Popcorn.
-ALL: Oh.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.060
Wonderful.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.262
Thank you, Florence.

07:42.329 --> 07:45.265
Say, how about
a game of charades?

07:45.332 --> 07:47.267
-Oh, that's a wonderful idea.
-HELEN: I'd love to play that.

07:47.334 --> 07:49.102
Oh, couldn't we play
something else?

07:49.169 --> 07:51.872
Yeah.
Let's play Pin A Tail On
The Honky.

08:01.782 --> 08:05.953
You know,
I just remembered
a marvelous game.

08:06.019 --> 08:08.756
It's such fun,
I don't know why
I ever stopped playing it.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.891
-It's called Nobody's Perfect.
-Oh.

08:10.958 --> 08:12.960
Oh, a game especially
for George.

08:14.795 --> 08:16.229
How do you play it?

08:16.296 --> 08:18.932
Uh, well, first we need
something to serve as a
blindfold.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.969
Oh. Well, how about this
dust cloth? It's clean.

08:22.035 --> 08:24.371
Of course it's clean.
You ain't never used it.

08:25.739 --> 08:27.675
All right,
now who wants to go first?

08:28.275 --> 08:29.342
(LAUGHING)

08:29.409 --> 08:30.410
Oh!

08:31.311 --> 08:33.213
Oh splendid, Mr. Willis.

08:33.280 --> 08:34.915
(ALL CHEERING)

08:34.982 --> 08:37.651
All right, I'll just tie
this on you here.

08:37.718 --> 08:41.088
Now, once your eyes
are covered,

08:41.154 --> 08:42.923
I'm going to say the word "go"

08:42.990 --> 08:45.693
and everybody has to change
seats very fast, you see?

08:45.759 --> 08:49.162
Then when I say the word
"stop" everyone freezes,

08:49.229 --> 08:50.698
and you have to
point at someone.

08:50.764 --> 08:53.400
Then you remove your
blindfold, and whoever it
is you're pointing at,

08:53.466 --> 08:56.536
he or she has to tell you
what they like most about you.

08:56.604 --> 08:58.839
Oh, oh, that should be easy.

08:58.906 --> 09:01.541
And what they like least
about you.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.176
That should be even easier.

09:05.145 --> 09:07.014
-Can you see?
-Uh, no, I...

09:07.080 --> 09:08.582
-All right, let's go!
-Oh.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.885
(ALL CLAMORING)

09:15.589 --> 09:17.290
And stop!

09:19.092 --> 09:20.961
BENTLEY:
Take off your blindfold.

09:21.028 --> 09:23.430
(LAUGHING)

09:23.496 --> 09:25.165
Go ahead, Mrs. Willis.
Tell your husband

09:25.232 --> 09:27.334
what it is you like
most about him.

09:27.400 --> 09:30.604
Let's see,
what do I like about Tom?

09:33.173 --> 09:34.742
You have to think about it?

09:36.176 --> 09:38.011
Well, there's so many things.

09:38.078 --> 09:41.448
But what I like most is that
Tom is a man of conviction,

09:41.514 --> 09:43.283
who stands up for
what he believes in.

09:43.350 --> 09:45.786
-(ALL CLAPPING)
-LOUISE: Oh, that's nice.

09:45.853 --> 09:47.855
Well, thank you, Helen.

09:47.921 --> 09:50.457
And now you must say
what you like least about him.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.793
Oh, she'll have to think
a long time about that.

09:52.860 --> 09:53.894
No, I won't.

09:56.630 --> 09:58.598
Oh?

09:58.666 --> 10:02.736
What I like least about
you is your lack of willpower.

10:02.803 --> 10:05.338
Oh? What do you mean by that?

10:05.405 --> 10:06.974
I mean your diet.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.809
Tom goes on a diet
in the morning,

10:08.876 --> 10:11.344
and by lunchtime he's off it.

10:11.411 --> 10:13.380
He simply can't resist food.

10:15.415 --> 10:17.885
Hey, I got a way to stop
Tom from eating so much.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.153
-How?
-Serve him Florence's cooking.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.590
How do you know
about my cooking?

10:23.657 --> 10:25.793
You don't stop talking
long enough to taste it.

10:26.894 --> 10:28.461
All right, Mrs. Willis,
it's your turn.

10:28.528 --> 10:30.063
-Oh, yes.
-Come on.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.966
-Oops, the blindfold.
-Here it is, here it is.

10:33.033 --> 10:34.434
Come on.

10:38.505 --> 10:40.473
Louise, do you think I'm fat?

10:42.575 --> 10:45.278
-Well, no...
-Oh, thank you.

10:49.182 --> 10:51.451
All right now, are we ready?
And let's go!

10:51.518 --> 10:52.652
(ALL CHEERING)

10:52.720 --> 10:54.254
-Oh.
-Hey, that's my seat.

10:56.489 --> 10:58.158
And stop!

10:59.392 --> 11:01.294
Oh, good,
you pointed at Mr. J.

11:03.596 --> 11:06.533
Can't I try it again?

11:06.599 --> 11:09.703
No, I'm afraid that's
against the rule.
Go ahead, Mr. J.

11:09.770 --> 11:12.672
-Tell Mrs. Willis what it
is you like most about her.
-GEORGE: Well...

11:12.740 --> 11:16.343
Go on, George.
I'm sure you can say
something nice.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.578
Yeah. There is one thing
I like about Helen.

11:18.645 --> 11:20.814
But I don't want her to
get the wrong idea.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.950
Oh, I'm sure she'd love
to hear it.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.753
Well... (CLEARS THROAT)

11:25.819 --> 11:27.821
Of all the women I know
as old as you...

11:27.888 --> 11:29.089
What?

11:31.058 --> 11:32.826
What I meant was,

11:32.893 --> 11:35.228
for a woman your age,
you look better than any woman
I know.

11:35.996 --> 11:39.132
Aww! Gee, George.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.701
I can't believe you'd say
something so sweet.

11:41.769 --> 11:44.537
Why not? I'm a sweet guy.
Ain't I, Weez?

11:51.745 --> 11:54.815
Oh yes, you sure are.

11:54.882 --> 11:58.786
Uh, George, can I talk
to you in the kitchen
for a minute?

11:58.852 --> 12:01.088
But, Weezy, I ain't told Helen
what I don't like
about her yet.

12:01.154 --> 12:05.392
Oh, George, that can wait.
Besides, you're too sweet
to say anything bad.

12:05.458 --> 12:07.260
Hey, hey, don't go nowhere.
I got a lot to say to you yet.

12:08.161 --> 12:09.562
Weezy, what are you doing?

12:09.629 --> 12:12.465
-George,
what did you mean by that?
-By what?

12:12.532 --> 12:14.234
By what you said to Helen.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.703
That she looked better
than any woman you know.

12:16.770 --> 12:18.038
But, Weezy,
that's part of the game.

12:18.105 --> 12:20.007
I had to say something
nice about her.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.341
But what about me?

12:21.408 --> 12:23.076
She didn't point to you.

12:27.514 --> 12:30.117
I don't mean that.

12:30.183 --> 12:32.585
Don't you think I look
good anymore?

12:32.652 --> 12:34.021
Of course you do.

12:34.087 --> 12:35.889
Then why don't you
ever say it?

12:35.956 --> 12:39.726
-Okay. You look better than
any woman I know.
-Oh, you're just saying that.

12:39.793 --> 12:41.528
Weezy, would you quit
acting silly?

12:41.594 --> 12:44.364
You're my wife,
you don't have to look good!

12:51.338 --> 12:53.373
What?

12:53.440 --> 12:56.076
Hold it. Look, look, what
I mean is like, we just spend
so much time together,

12:56.143 --> 12:57.911
I forget how good you
really look.

12:57.978 --> 13:01.448
-Well, I'll fix that!
-How?

13:01.514 --> 13:04.084
Maybe if we don't spend
any time together tonight,

13:04.151 --> 13:05.953
I'll look better
to you in the morning.

13:06.019 --> 13:07.654
What... Weezy, wait!

13:07.720 --> 13:09.322
Oh, I understand
perfectly, Helen.

13:09.389 --> 13:11.491
-You think I'm fat.
-Tom, that's not what I said.

13:11.558 --> 13:13.861
Watch it, fatso.
Weezy, hold it.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.630
Weezy, come out of there
this minute!

13:17.697 --> 13:20.968
Well, since I'm already
too fat, I'm going into
the kitchen

13:21.034 --> 13:25.272
-to have a piece of pie.
-Oh, Tom,
stop acting so childish.

13:25.338 --> 13:27.107
Really, what is with you?

13:27.174 --> 13:29.376
TOM: I'm going to have a big
piece of pie.

13:30.210 --> 13:31.744
(CLAMORING)

13:31.811 --> 13:32.812
Hey, Weezy.

13:33.713 --> 13:35.883
Some game, Mr. Bentley.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.717
Yes, uh, now I remember

13:37.784 --> 13:39.619
why I stopped playing it.

13:48.261 --> 13:49.762
Weezy, would you come out?

13:49.829 --> 13:51.631
LOUISE: I can't hear you,
George.

13:51.698 --> 13:53.366
Okay, go ahead and act stupid.

13:53.433 --> 13:56.736
You're the one that's
missing out on a big surprise.
You hear me?

13:58.371 --> 14:00.874
Okay, look, have it your way.

14:00.941 --> 14:04.677
But I'm going to bed. Now.
By myself!

14:08.115 --> 14:09.883
What you got to say
about that?

14:10.783 --> 14:12.185
-George?
-Yeah?

14:19.092 --> 14:20.593
-Mr. Jefferson...
-Shut up, Florence.

14:20.660 --> 14:23.796
-Uh, Mr. J...
-Shut up.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.633
Well, if there ain't
gonna be no big surprise,
I'm going to bed, too.

14:26.699 --> 14:28.835
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

14:28.902 --> 14:30.737
If you think I'm fat now,
Helen,

14:32.005 --> 14:35.275
-just wait till I finish this.
-Tom, please.

14:35.342 --> 14:37.144
I'll be as big as a house!

14:39.146 --> 14:40.580
-Mr. Bentley...
-(CRIES OUT)

14:44.017 --> 14:45.852
-Is he gone?
-Who?

14:45.919 --> 14:47.955
-George.
-Oh yes, he went to bed.

14:48.021 --> 14:52.859
Good. Helen, do you mind
if I sleep with you
in Alan's room?

14:52.926 --> 14:55.862
-I'd rather not sleep with
George tonight.
-Well...

14:55.929 --> 14:58.031
Oh, of course
she doesn't mind.

14:58.098 --> 15:00.100
She'd rather sleep with you
than with me.

15:00.167 --> 15:02.269
I might roll over
and squash her!

15:06.539 --> 15:09.977
Tom, I give up.
Come on, Louise,
let's go to bed.

15:12.112 --> 15:14.948
Well, I suppose I may as
well turn in, too.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.883
Boy, uh, that's a good idea.

15:17.985 --> 15:19.886
Wait a minute, Bentley,

15:19.953 --> 15:23.423
this means that one of us
has to sleep with George.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.493
Well, Mrs. J. has already
assigned me to the sofa.

15:26.559 --> 15:27.827
(CHUCKLES)

15:27.894 --> 15:31.731
Now, Bentley, uh,
let's handle this like adults.

15:31.798 --> 15:36.403
Uh, uh, oh, I know.
I'll play you paper,
rocks and scissors.

15:36.469 --> 15:39.039
Oh, all right.
And the winner gets the sofa.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.773
-Good. Are you ready?
-Yes.

15:40.840 --> 15:43.010
BOTH: One, two, three.

15:43.076 --> 15:45.778
-Oh. Paper covers rock.
-Oh. Ow!

15:48.915 --> 15:50.417
You wanna try
two out of three?

15:52.119 --> 15:53.853
Sleep tight, Mr. Willis.

16:16.376 --> 16:20.213
Ha!
So you decided to sleep
with me after all, huh?

16:20.280 --> 16:23.816
Well, if your think
I'm gonna roll over and give
you a big kiss, forget it.

16:25.585 --> 16:28.321
Well, that's a relief.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.956
Willis, what the hell are
you doing in here?

16:30.023 --> 16:31.958
Well, paper covers rock!

16:32.025 --> 16:33.493
Say what?

16:33.560 --> 16:35.495
Look, George,
there isn't any place else
for me to sleep.

16:35.562 --> 16:37.530
Try sleeping in your own bed.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.732
It's freezing up there.
I'd turn blue.

16:39.799 --> 16:41.468
Better blue than white.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.437
I don't like this anymore
than you do.

16:44.504 --> 16:46.139
Okay, look, Willis,
if you gotta sleep here,

16:46.206 --> 16:48.508
just lie down and go to sleep
and shut up!

16:48.575 --> 16:50.877
The sooner we get to sleep,
the sooner this
lousy day will be over.

16:50.943 --> 16:51.944
Agreed.

16:55.148 --> 16:56.149
(GRUNTS)

17:01.321 --> 17:02.589
What are you doing?

17:02.655 --> 17:05.625
George, do you mind
if I sleep on that side
of the bed?

17:05.692 --> 17:07.227
What's wrong with
the side you're sleeping on?

17:07.294 --> 17:09.396
-Well, it's just that
that side is my side.
-Wrong.

17:09.462 --> 17:13.900
This side is my side.
That side is my side.
All of the sides are my sides!

17:17.837 --> 17:20.840
Willis, this is my bed,
and I decide who sleeps where.

17:20.907 --> 17:22.675
Now just lie down
and go to sleep.

17:26.413 --> 17:28.047
Oh. Oh.

17:29.349 --> 17:30.717
(TOM GRUNTS)

17:40.693 --> 17:42.061
What are you trying to do?

17:42.129 --> 17:43.930
I'm sorry, George,
but I really can't sleep

17:43.996 --> 17:45.665
unless I'm on the right side
of the bed.

17:45.732 --> 17:47.867
Okay, if you gotta sleep
on the right side of the bed,

17:47.934 --> 17:51.604
why don't you just put your
pillow at the foot of the bed
and turn your body around?

17:51.671 --> 17:54.241
Hey, that's not a bad idea.
Thanks, George.

17:55.808 --> 17:56.809
Oh boy.

18:14.527 --> 18:15.528
(SIGHS)

18:23.136 --> 18:24.671
This isn't working too well.

18:38.451 --> 18:41.554
-Oh.
-Look, Willis, if you want
this side of the bed, take it!

18:42.322 --> 18:43.890
Oh, thanks, George.

18:55.268 --> 18:57.003
-(GEORGE GRUNTS)
-Oh.

19:00.740 --> 19:04.344
What a big baby you are.
Can't get to sleep unless
everything is just right.

19:07.914 --> 19:09.882
Hold it, Willis, you got
my pillow.

19:12.985 --> 19:13.986
(SIGHS)

19:15.087 --> 19:16.523
(GEORGE GRUNTS)

19:16.589 --> 19:17.590
(SIGHS)

19:25.332 --> 19:26.666
Oh. I almost forgot.

19:27.467 --> 19:28.835
What now?

19:28.901 --> 19:31.804
-I forgot to do my exercises.
-Exercises?

19:31.871 --> 19:36.142
Yes, I always do
10 sit-ups every night
before going to bed.

19:37.076 --> 19:38.345
-(INHALES)
-If you wanna exercise,

19:38.411 --> 19:41.648
-exercise on the floor.
-Oh, it's too cold.

19:41.714 --> 19:43.783
-Well look, Willis,
I've had it with you!
-(INHALES)

19:43.850 --> 19:45.618
Now, this bed ain't big enough
for both of us!

19:45.685 --> 19:47.587
George, this is a
king-size bed.

19:47.654 --> 19:50.223
Right. And I'm the king,
and you're giving me
a royal pain.

19:51.591 --> 19:53.526
-Where are you going?
-To my throne!

19:59.532 --> 20:01.033
Say goodnight.

20:02.902 --> 20:06.038
-Goodnight.
-(IN HIGH-PITCHED VOICE)
You're welcome.

20:07.374 --> 20:08.375
Goodnight.

20:09.476 --> 20:10.743
Goodnight.

20:10.810 --> 20:14.414
Chester! Chester, you did it!
Oh, good boy.

20:14.481 --> 20:17.517
-Come on, I'll get you
a birdie bon-bon.
-FLORENCE: Thank you.

20:17.584 --> 20:19.319
Oh, you're welcome.

20:22.555 --> 20:25.057
Oh, hi, Florence.
What are you doing up?

20:25.124 --> 20:28.194
-Getting something to eat.
I couldn't sleep.
-Me neither.

20:28.261 --> 20:30.263
I think I could use
a snack, too.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.432
Yeah, I guess it's no fun
sleeping without your husband

20:32.499 --> 20:33.733
on your anniversary, huh?

20:34.367 --> 20:35.635
Anniversary?

20:35.702 --> 20:38.070
Yeah, of your first date
with Mr. Jefferson.

20:38.137 --> 20:40.573
Oh, that's not
until next week.

20:40.640 --> 20:42.775
Well, Mr. Jefferson
thinks it's tomorrow.

20:42.842 --> 20:46.313
And at midnight, he wanted
to be the first one
to say happy anniversary.

20:46.379 --> 20:49.782
Oh, Florence,
I'm glad you told me this.

20:49.849 --> 20:54.287
Oh, sometimes George
can be so sweet,
even when he makes me mad.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.392
(SHIVERING)

21:22.181 --> 21:25.017
Oh, darling, you're so sweet.

21:25.084 --> 21:26.319
-What?
-Tom!

21:28.955 --> 21:31.123
Tom, I thought
you were George!

21:31.190 --> 21:32.892
I thought you were George.

21:32.959 --> 21:34.961
Oh. Oh look, Tom,

21:35.027 --> 21:37.664
I changed my mind
about sleeping
with George tonight.

21:37.730 --> 21:39.566
-Is that okay with you?
-Okay?

21:39.632 --> 21:43.470
Oh, Louise,
you're a life saver.
Well, what about Helen?

21:43.536 --> 21:45.171
You think she'll want me
to sleep with her?

21:45.237 --> 21:47.707
I think she'd love you to
sleep with her.

21:47.774 --> 21:49.709
Oh yeah, I guess you're right.

21:51.444 --> 21:54.113
After all, there's so much
of me to love.

22:05.725 --> 22:08.194
Well, Willis,
I see you finally finished
your exercises.

22:08.260 --> 22:10.329
Now maybe we can get
some sleep.

22:10.397 --> 22:12.432
(COUGHING)

22:13.933 --> 22:16.703
You know, at midnight
it's gonna be the anniversary

22:16.769 --> 22:18.070
of the first time
I went out with Weezy,

22:18.137 --> 22:21.140
and here I am spending
it with you. (SCOFFS)

22:21.207 --> 22:23.843
This is the first time
I didn't forget it.

22:23.910 --> 22:26.546
I even bought her
a brand new diamond necklace.

22:27.246 --> 22:28.548
Diamonds?

22:35.154 --> 22:37.657
Man, Willis, it sounds
like you're catching a cold.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.760
(COUGHING)

22:40.827 --> 22:44.564
I'll never forget
that first date.
We went to Coney Island

22:44.631 --> 22:47.400
and rode on the Tunnel of Love
three times. (SCOFFS)

22:47.467 --> 22:49.602
Weezy wouldn't let me
kiss her though.

22:49.669 --> 22:52.138
But the third time
through the tunnel,
she reached out

22:52.204 --> 22:55.508
and held my hand.
And you know something?

22:55.575 --> 22:57.076
Even today, when me
and Weezy hold hands,

22:57.143 --> 22:58.911
I always get
that same feeling.

23:01.047 --> 23:03.883
-So do I, George.
-Weezy!

23:05.284 --> 23:07.253
What are you doing here?

23:07.319 --> 23:10.823
George, you didn't really
think I could sleep
without you, did you?

23:10.890 --> 23:13.626
Especially on our anniversary.

23:13.693 --> 23:14.927
-Aww.
-(KNOCK ON DOOR)

23:14.994 --> 23:16.529
Who is it?

23:16.596 --> 23:18.631
It's me. Ralph's here.

23:18.698 --> 23:21.834
He said to tell you the
heat's working again at
Bentley's and at the Willises.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.570
Well, that's good news.

23:23.636 --> 23:26.338
Well the bad news is,
it ain't working
in this apartment.

23:27.273 --> 23:29.241
What are we gonna do?

23:29.308 --> 23:31.410
I'll tell you what I'm
gonna do. I'm gonna spend
the night at the Willises.

23:31.478 --> 23:33.212
And they said
you're invited, too.

23:33.279 --> 23:36.115
Oh. Well, tell Helen thanks,
Florence.

23:36.182 --> 23:40.352
But George just reminded me
that this is the
anniversary of our first date.

23:40.419 --> 23:41.854
Anniversary? But you said...

23:41.921 --> 23:44.123
And I think we'd like to
spend it alone.

23:53.232 --> 23:55.167
Okay, I'll see you
in the morning.

23:58.337 --> 23:59.506
(SIGHS)

23:59.572 --> 24:01.741
Weezy, what are we gonna do
about the cold?

24:01.808 --> 24:06.145
Oh, George, I'm sure you
can think of some way to
keep us warm.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.617
Right.
I'll get the electric blanket.

24:10.683 --> 24:14.186
-George!
-I was just kidding, Weez.

24:14.253 --> 24:15.287
Ohh. (CHUCKLING)

24:47.887 --> 24:52.925
LOUISE: The Jeffersons was
videotaped in front of
a studio audience.

24:52.992 --> 24:55.628
* Movin', movin' on up
